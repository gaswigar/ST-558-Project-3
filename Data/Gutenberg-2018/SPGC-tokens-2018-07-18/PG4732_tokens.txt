the
work
which
forms
the
greater
part
of
the
present
volume
first
appeared
in
under
the
title
history
of
israel
by
wellhausen
in
two
volumes
volume
i
the
book
produced
a
great
impression
throughout
europe
and
its
main
thesis
that
the
mosaic
history
is
not
the
for
the
history
of
ancient
israel
but
for
the
history
of
judaism
was
felt
to
be
so
powerfully
maintained
that
many
of
the
leading
hebrew
teachers
of
germany
who
had
till
then
stood
aloof
from
the
grafian
hypothesis
the
doctrine
that
is
that
the
levitical
law
and
connected
parts
of
the
pentateuch
were
not
written
till
after
the
fall
of
the
kingdom
of
judah
and
that
the
pentateuch
in
its
present
compass
was
not
publicly
accepted
as
authoritative
till
the
reformation
of
ezra
declared
themselves
convinced
by
wellhausen
arguments
before
the
grafian
hypothesis
was
neglected
or
treated
as
a
paradox
in
most
german
universities
although
some
individual
scholars
of
great
name
were
known
to
have
reached
by
independent
inquiry
similar
views
to
those
for
which
graf
was
the
recognised
sponsor
and
although
in
holland
the
writings
of
professor
kuenen
who
has
been
aptly
termed
goel
had
shown
in
an
admirable
and
conclusive
manner
that
the
objections
usually
taken
to
graf
arguments
did
not
touch
the
substance
of
the
thesis
for
which
he
contended
since
partly
through
the
growing
influence
of
kuenen
but
mainly
through
the
impression
produced
by
wellhausen
book
all
this
has
been
changed
almost
every
younger
scholar
of
mark
is
on
the
side
of
vatke
and
reuss
lagarde
and
graf
kuenen
and
wellhausen
and
the
renewed
interest
in
old
testament
study
which
is
making
itself
felt
throughout
all
the
schools
of
europe
must
be
traced
almost
entirely
to
the
stimulus
derived
from
a
new
view
of
the
history
of
the
law
which
sets
all
old
testament
problems
in
a
new
light
our
author
who
since
had
been
largely
engaged
in
the
study
of
other
parts
of
semitic
antiquity
has
not
yet
given
to
the
world
his
promised
second
volume
but
the
first
volume
was
a
complete
book
in
itself
the
plan
was
to
reserve
the
whole
narrative
of
the
history
of
israel
for
so
that
was
entirely
occupied
in
laying
the
critical
foundations
on
which
alone
a
real
history
of
the
hebrew
nation
could
be
built
accordingly
the
second
edition
of
the
history
appeared
in
berlin
reimer
under
the
new
title
of
prolegomena
to
the
history
of
israel
in
this
form
it
is
professedly
as
it
really
was
before
a
complete
and
work
and
this
is
the
form
of
which
a
translation
carefully
revised
by
the
author
is
now
offered
to
the
public
all
english
readers
interested
in
the
old
testament
will
certainly
be
grateful
to
the
translators
and
publishers
for
a
volume
which
in
its
german
garb
has
already
produced
so
profound
an
impression
on
the
scholarship
of
europe
and
even
in
this
country
the
name
is
too
well
known
to
make
it
necessary
to
introduce
him
at
length
to
a
new
public
but
the
title
of
the
book
has
a
somewhat
unfamiliar
sound
to
english
ears
and
may
be
apt
to
suggest
a
series
of
dry
and
learned
dissertations
meant
only
for
hebrew
scholars
it
is
worth
while
therefore
to
point
out
in
a
few
words
that
this
would
be
quite
a
false
impression
that
the
matters
with
which
professor
wellhausen
deals
are
such
as
no
intelligent
student
of
the
old
testament
can
afford
to
neglect
and
that
the
present
volume
gives
the
english
reader
for
the
first
time
an
opportunity
to
form
his
own
judgment
on
questions
which
are
within
the
scope
of
any
one
who
reads
the
english
bible
carefully
and
is
able
to
think
clearly
and
without
prejudice
about
its
contents
the
history
of
israel
is
part
of
the
history
of
the
faith
by
which
we
live
the
new
testament
can
not
be
rightly
understood
without
understanding
the
old
and
the
main
reason
why
so
many
parts
of
the
old
testament
are
practically
a
sealed
book
even
to
thoughtful
people
is
simply
that
they
have
not
the
historical
key
to
the
interpretation
of
that
wonderful
literature
the
old
testament
does
not
furnish
a
history
of
israel
though
it
supplies
the
materials
from
which
such
a
history
can
be
constructed
for
example
the
narrative
of
kings
gives
but
the
merest
outline
of
the
events
that
preceded
the
fall
of
samaria
to
understand
the
inner
history
of
thc
time
we
must
fill
up
this
outline
with
the
aid
of
the
prophets
amos
and
hosea
but
the
more
the
old
testament
has
been
studied
the
more
plain
has
it
become
that
for
many
parts
of
the
history
something
more
is
needed
than
merely
to
read
each
part
of
the
narrative
books
in
connection
with
the
other
books
that
illustrate
the
same
period
the
historical
books
and
the
pentateuch
are
themselves
very
composite
structures
in
which
old
narratives
occur
imbedded
in
later
compilations
and
groups
of
old
laws
are
overlaid
by
ordinances
of
comparatively
recent
date
now
to
take
one
point
only
but
that
the
most
important
it
must
plainly
make
a
vast
difference
to
our
whole
view
of
the
providential
course
of
israel
history
if
it
appear
that
instead
of
the
whole
pentateuchal
law
having
been
given
to
israel
before
the
tribes
crossed
the
jordan
that
law
really
grew
up
little
by
little
from
its
mosaic
germ
and
did
not
attain
its
present
form
till
the
israelites
were
the
captives
or
the
subjects
of
a
foreign
power
this
is
what
the
new
school
of
pentateuch
criticism
undertakes
to
prove
and
it
does
so
in
a
way
that
should
interest
every
one
for
in
the
course
of
the
argument
it
appears
that
the
plain
natural
sense
of
the
old
history
has
constantly
been
distorted
by
the
false
presuppositions
with
which
we
have
been
accustomed
to
approach
it
that
having
a
false
idea
of
the
legal
and
religious
culture
of
the
hebrews
when
they
first
entered
canaan
we
continually
miss
the
point
of
the
most
interesting
parts
of
the
subsequent
story
and
above
all
fail
to
understand
the
great
work
accomplished
by
the
prophets
in
destroying
old
israel
and
preparing
the
way
first
for
judaism
and
then
for
the
gospel
these
surely
are
inquiries
which
no
conscientious
student
of
the
bible
can
afford
to
ignore
the
process
of
disentangling
the
twisted
skein
of
tradition
is
necessarily
a
very
delicate
and
complicated
one
and
involves
certain
operations
for
which
special
scholarship
is
indispensable
historical
criticism
is
a
comparatively
modern
science
and
in
its
application
to
this
as
to
other
histories
it
has
made
many
false
and
uncertain
steps
but
in
this
as
in
other
sciences
when
the
truth
has
been
reached
it
can
generally
be
presented
in
a
comparatively
simple
form
and
the
main
positions
can
be
justified
even
to
the
general
reader
by
methods
much
less
complicated
and
much
more
lucid
than
those
originally
followed
by
the
investigators
themselves
the
modern
view
as
to
the
age
of
the
pentateuchal
law
which
is
the
key
to
the
right
understanding
of
the
history
of
israel
has
been
reached
by
a
mass
of
investigations
and
discussions
of
which
no
satisfactory
general
account
has
ever
been
laid
before
the
english
reader
indeed
even
on
the
continent
where
the
subject
has
been
much
more
studied
than
among
us
professor
wellhausen
book
was
the
first
complete
and
sustained
argument
which
took
up
the
question
in
all
its
historical
bearings
more
recently
professor
kuenen
of
leyden
whose
discussions
of
the
more
complicated
questions
of
pentateuch
analysis
are
perhaps
the
finest
things
that
modern
criticism
can
show
has
brought
out
the
second
edition
of
the
first
volume
of
his
onderzoek
and
when
this
appears
in
english
as
it
is
soon
to
do
our
hebrew
students
will
have
in
their
hands
an
admirable
manual
of
what
i
may
call
the
anatomy
of
the
pentateuch
in
which
they
can
follow
from
chapter
to
chapter
the
process
by
which
the
pentateuch
grew
to
its
present
form
but
for
the
mass
of
such
detailed
analysis
will
always
be
too
difficult
what
every
one
can
understand
and
ought
to
try
to
master
is
the
broad
historical
aspect
of
the
matter
and
this
the
present
volume
sets
forth
in
a
way
that
must
be
full
of
interest
to
every
one
who
has
tasted
the
intense
pleasure
of
following
institutions
and
ideas
in
their
growth
and
who
has
faith
enough
to
see
the
hand
of
god
as
clearly
in
a
long
providential
development
as
in
a
sudden
miracle
the
reader
will
find
that
every
part
of
the
prolegomena
is
instinct
with
historical
interest
and
contributes
something
to
a
vivid
realisation
of
what
old
israel
really
was
and
why
it
has
so
great
a
part
in
the
history
of
spiritual
faith
in
the
first
essay
of
the
prolegomena
a
complete
picture
is
given
of
the
history
of
the
ordinances
of
worship
in
israel
and
the
sacrifices
the
feasts
the
priesthood
are
all
set
in
a
fresh
light
the
second
essay
the
history
of
what
the
israelites
themselves
believed
and
recorded
about
their
past
will
perhaps
to
some
readers
seem
less
inviting
and
may
perhaps
best
be
read
after
perusal
of
the
article
reprinted
from
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
which
stands
at
the
close
of
the
volume
and
affords
a
general
view
of
the
course
of
the
history
of
israel
as
our
author
constructs
it
on
the
basis
of
the
researches
in
his
prolegomena
the
essay
on
israel
and
judaism

the

in

it
is
proposed
to
discuss
the
place
in
history
of
the
law
of
moses
more
precisely
the
question
to
be
considered
is
whether
that
law
is
the
for
the
history
of
ancient
israel
or
not
rather
for
that
of
judaism
of
the
religious
communion
which
survived
the
destruction
of
the
nation
by
the
assyrians
and
chaldaeans
i
it
is
an
opinion
very
extensively
held
that
the
great
mass
of
the
books
of
the
old
testament
not
only
relate
to
the
period
but
date
from
it
according
to
this
view
they
are
remnants
of
the
literature
of
ancient
israel
which
the
jews
rescued
as
a
heritage
from
the
past
and
on
which
they
continued
to
subsist
in
the
decay
of
independent
intellectual
life
in
dogmatic
theology
judaism
is
a
mere
empty
chasm
over
which
one
springs
from
the
old
testament
to
the
new
and
even
where
this
estimate
is
modified
the
belief
still
prevails
in
a
general
way
that
the
judaism
which
received
the
books
of
scripture
into
the
canon
had
as
a
rule
nothing
to
do
with
their
production
but
the
exceptions
to
this
principle
which
are
conceded
as
regards
the
second
and
third
divisions
of
the
hebrew
canon
can
not
be
called
so
very
slight
of
the
hagiograpba
by
far
the
larger
portion
is
demonstrably
and
no
part
demonstrably
older
than
the
exile
daniel
comes
as
far
down
as
the
maccabaean
wars
and
esther
is
perhaps
even
later
of
the
prophetical
literature
a
very
appreciable
fraction
is
later
than
the
fall
of
the
hebrew
kingdom
and
the
associated
historical
books
the
earlier
prophets
of
the
hebrew
canon
date
in
the
form
in
which
we
now
possess
them
from
a
period
subsequent
to
the
death
of
jeconiah
who
must
have
survived
the
year
for
some
time
making
all
allowance
for
the
older
sources
utilised
and
to
a
large
extent
transcribed
word
for
word
in
judges
samuel
and
kings
we
find
that
apart
from
the
pentateuch
the
preexilic
portion
of
the
old
testament
amounts
in
bulk
to
little
more
than
the
half
of
the
entire
volume
all
the
rest
belongs
to
the
later
period
and
it
includes
not
merely
the
feeble
of
a
failing
vegetation
but
also
productions
of
the
vigour
and
originality
of
isa
and
we
come
then
to
the
law
here
as
for
most
parts
of
the
old
testament
we
have
no
express
information
as
to
the
author
and
date
of
composition
and
to
get
even
approximately
at
the
truth
we
are
shut
up
to
the
use
of
such
data
as
can
be
derived
from
an
analysis
of
the
contents
taken
in
conjunction
with
what
we
may
happen
to
know
from
other
sources
as
to
the
course
of
israel
history
but
the
habit
has
been
to
assume
that
the
historical
period
to
be
considered
in
this
connection
ends
with
the
babylonian
exile
as
certainly
as
it
begins
with
the
exodus
from
egypt
at
first
sight
this
assumption
seems
to
be
justified
by
the
history
of
the
canon
it
was
the
law
that
first
became
canonical
through
the
influence
of
ezra
and
nehemiah
the
prophets
became
so
considerably
later
and
the
hagiographa
last
of
all
now
it
is
not
unnatural
from
the
chronological
order
in
which
these
writings
were
received
into
the
canon
to
proceed
to
an
inference
as
to
their
approximate
relative
age
and
so
not
only
to
place
the
prophets
before
the
hagiographa
but
also
the
five
books
of
moses
before
the
prophets
if
the
prophets
are
for
the
most
part
older
than
the
exile
how
much
more
so
the
law
but
however
trustworthy
such
a
mode
of
comparison
may
be
when
applied
to
the
middle
as
contrasted
with
the
latest
portion
of
the
canon
it
is
not
at
all
to
be
relied
on
when
the
first
part
is
contrasted
with
the
other
two
the
very
idea
of
canonicity
was
originally
associated
with
the
torah
and
was
only
afterwards
extended
to
the
other
books
which
slowly
and
by
a
gradual
process
acquired
a
certain
measure
of
the
validity
given
to
the
torah
by
a
single
public
and
formal
act
through
which
it
was
introduced
at
once
as
the
magna
charta
of
the
jewish
communion
nehemiah
in
their
case
the
canonical
that
is
legal
character
was
not
intrinsic
but
was
only
subsequently
acquired
there
must
therefore
have
been
some
interval
and
there
may
have
been
a
very
long
one
between
the
date
of
their
origin
and
that
of
their
receiving
public
sanction
to
the
law
on
the
other
hand
the
canonical
character
is
much
more
essential
and
serious
difficulties
beset
the
assumption
that
the
law
of
moses
came
into
existence
at
a
period
long
before
the
exile
aml
did
not
attain
the
force
of
law
until
many
centuries
afterwards
and
in
totally
different
circumstances
from
those
under
which
it
had
arisen
at
least
the
fact
that
a
collection
claiming
public
recognition
as
an
ecclesiastical
book
should
have
attained
such
recognition
earlier
than
other
writings
which
make
no
such
claim
is
no
proof
of
superior
antiquity
we
can
not
then
peremptorily
refuse
to
regard
it
as
possible
that
what
was
the
law
of
judaism
may
also
have
been
its
product
and
there
are
urgent
reasons
for
taking
the
suggestion
into
very
careful
consideration
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
here
to
refer
to
personal
experience
in
my
early
student
days
i
was
attracted
by
the
stories
of
saul
and
david
ahab
and
elijah
the
discourses
of
amos
and
isaiah
laid
strong
hold
on
me
and
i
read
myself
well
into
the
prophetic
and
historical
books
of
the
old
testament
thanks
to
such
aids
as
were
accessible
to
me
i
even
considered
that
i
understood
them
tolerably
but
at
the
same
time
was
troubled
with
a
bad
conscience
as
if
i
were
beginning
with
the
roof
instead
of
the
foundation
for
i
had
no
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
law
of
which
i
was
accustomed
to
be
told
that
it
was
the
basis
and
postulate
of
the
whole
literature
at
last
i
took
courage
and
made
my
way
through
exodus
leviticus
numbers
and
even
through
knobel
commentary
to
these
books
but
it
was
in
vain
that
i
looked
for
the
light
which
was
to
be
shed
from
this
source
on
the
historical
and
prophetical
books
on
the
contrary
my
enjoyment
of
the
latter
was
marred
by
the
law
it
did
not
bring
them
any
nearer
me
but
intruded
itself
uneasily
like
a
ghost
that
makes
a
noise
indeed
but
is
not
visible
and
really
effects
nothing
even
where
there
were
points
of
contact
between
it
and
them
differences
also
made
themselves
felt
and
i
found
it
impossible
to
give
a
candid
decision
in
favour
of
the
priority
of
the
law
dimly
i
began
to
perceive
that
throughout
there
was
between
them
all
the
difference
that
separates
two
wholly
distinct
worlds
yet
so
far
from
attaining
clear
conceptions
i
only
fell
into
deeper
confusion
which
was
worse
confounded
by
the
explanations
of
ewald
in
the
second
volume
of
history
of
israel
at
last
in
the
course
of
a
casual
visit
in
gottingen
in
the
summer
of
i
learned
through
ritschl
that
karl
heinrich
graf
placed
the
law
later
than
the
prophets
and
almost
without
knowing
his
reasons
for
the
hypothesis
i
was
prepared
to
accept
it
i
readily
acknowledged
to
myself
thc
possibility
of
understanding
hebrew
antiquity
without
the
book
of
the
torah
the
hypothesis
usually
associated
with
graf
name
is
really
not
his
of
his
teacher
eduard
reuss
it
would
be
still
more
correct
to
call
it
after
leopold
gcorge
and
wiihelm
vatke

independent
alike
of
reuss
and
of

were
the

he
indeed
did

himself

in
reaching

he
was

clearly
to
perceive
and
point
out
how
disconnected
are
the
alleged
of
israel
history
and
that
history
itself
the
religious
community
set
up
on
so
broad
a

in

with

no
trace
as
soon
as

settles
in
a
land
of
its
own
and
becomes
in
any
proper
sense
a
nation
the
period
of
the
judges
presents
itself
to
us
as
a
confused
chaos
out
of
which
order
and
coherence
are
gradually
evolved
under
the
pressure
of
external
circumstances
but
perfectly
naturally
and
without
the
faintest
reminiscence
of
a
sacred
unifying
constitution
that
had
formerly
existed
hebrew
antiquity
shows
absolutely
no
tendencies
towards
a
hierocracy
power
is
wielded
solely
by
the
heads
of
families
and
of
tribes
and
by
the
kings
who
exercise
control
over
religious
worship
also
and
appoint
and
depose
its
priests
the
influence
possessed
by
the
latter
is
purely
moral
the
torah
of
god
is
not
a
document
in
their
hands
which
guarantees
their
own
position
but
merely
an
instruction
for
others
in
their
mouths
like
the
word
of
the
prophets
it
has
divine
authority
but
not
political
sanction
and
has
validity
only
in
so
far
as
it
is
voluntarily
accepted
and
as
for
the
literature
which
has
come
down
to
us
from
the
period
of
the
kings
it
would
puzzle
the
very
best
intentions
to
beat
up
so
many
as
two
or
three
unambiguous
allusions
to
the
law
and
these
can
not
be
held
to
prove
anything
when
one
considers
by
way
of
contrast
what
homer
was
to
the
greeks
to
complete
the
marvel
in
judaism
the
mosaism
which
until
then
had
been
only
latent
suddenly
emerges
into
prominence
everywhere
we
now
find
the
book
regarded
as
the
foundation
of
all
higher
life
and
the
jews
to
borrow
the
phrase
of
the
koran
are
the
people
of
the
book
we
have
the
sanctuary
with
its
priests
and
levites
occupying
the
central
position
and
the
people
as
a
congregation
encamped
around
it
the
cultus
with
its
and
its
purifications
and
its
abstinences
its
feasts
and
sabbaths
strictly
observed
as
prescribed
by
the
law
is
now
the
principal
business
of
life
when
we
take
the
community
of
the
second
temple
and
compare
it
with
the
ancient
people
of
israel
we
are
at
once
able
to
realise
how
far
removed
was
thc
latter
from
mosaism
the
jews
themselves
were
thoroughly
conscious
of
the
distance
the
revision
of
the
books
of
judges
samuel
and
kings
undertaken
towards
the
end
of
the
babylonian
exile
a
revision
much
more
thorough
than
is
commonly
assumed
condemns
as
heretical
the
whole
age
of
the
kings
at
a
later
date
as
the
past
became
more
invested
with
a
certain
nimbus
of
sanctity
men
preferred
to
clothe
it
with
the
characters
of
legitimacy
rather
than
sit
in
judgment
upon
it
the
book
of
chronicles
shows
in
what
manner
it
was
necessary
to
deal
with
the
history
of
bygone
times
when
it
was
assumed
that
the
mosaic
hierocracy
was
their
fundamental
institution
the
foregoing
remarks
are
designed
merely
to
make
it
plain
that
the
problem
we
have
set
before
us
is
not
an
imaginary
one
but
actual
and
urgent
they
are
intended
to
introduce
it
but
to
solve
it
is
by
no
means
so
easy
the
question
what
is
the
historical
place
of
the
law
does
not
even
admit
of
being
put
in
these
simple
terms
for
the
law
if
by
that
word
we
understand
the
entire
pentateuch
is
no
literary
unity
and
no
simple
historical
compare
the
article
pentateuch
in
the
ninth
edition
of
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
vol
xviii
since
the
days
of
peyrerius
and
spinoza
criticism
has
acknowledged
the
complex
character
of
that
remarkable
literary
production
and
from
jean
astruc
onwards
has
laboured
not
without
success
at
disentangling
its
original
elements
at
present
there
are
a
number
of
results
that
can
be
regarded
as
settled
the
following
are
some
of
them
the
five
books
of
moses
and
the
book
of
joshua
constitute
one
whole
the
conquest
of
the
promised
land
rather
than
the
death
of
moses
forming
the
true
conclusion
of
the
patriarchal
history
the
exodus
and
the
wandering
in
the
wilderness
from
a
literary
point
of
view
accordingly
it
is
more
accurate
to
speak
of
the
hexateuch
than
of
the
pentateuch
out
of
this
whole
the
book
of
deuteronomy
as
essentially
an
independent
admits
of
being
separated
most
easily
of
what
remains
the
parts
most
easily
distinguished
belong
to
the
main
stock
grundschrift
formerly
also
called
the
elohistic
document
on
account
of
the
use
it
makes
of
the
divine
name
elohim
up
to
the
time
of
moses
and
designated
by
ewald
with
reference
to
the
regularly
recurring
superscriptions
in
genesis
as
the
book
of
origins
it
is
distinguished
by
its
liking
for
number
and
measure
and
formula
generally
by
its
stiff
pedantic
style
by
its
constant
use
of
certain
phrases
and
turns
of
expression
which
do
not
occur
elsewhere
in
the
older
hebrew
its
characteristics
are
more
strongly
marked
than
those
of
any
of
the
others
and
make
it
accordingly
the
easiest
to
recognise
with
certainty
its
basis
is
the
book
of
leviticus
and
thc
allied
portions
of
the
adjoining
books
exodus
with
the
exception
of
chaps
and
with
trifling
exceptions
it
thus
contains
legislation
chiefly
and
in
point
of
fact
relates
substantially
to
the
worship
of
the
tabernacle
and
cognate
matters
it
is
historical
only
in
form
the
history
serves
merely
as
a
framework
on
which
to
arrange
thc
legislative
material
or
as
a
mask
to
disguise
it
for
the
most
part
the
thread
of
the
narrative
is
extremely
thin
and
often
serves
merely
to
carry
out
the
chronology
which
is
kept
up
without
a
hiatus
from
the
creation
to
the
exodus
it
becomes
fuller
only
on
the
occasions
in
which
other
interests
come
into
play
as
for
example
in
genesis
with
regard
to
the
three
preludes
to
the
mosaic
covenant
which
are
connected
with
the
names
of
adam
noah
and
abraham
respectively
when
this
fundamental
document
is
also
separated
out
as
well
as
deuteronomy
there
remains
the
jehovistic
which
in
contrast
with
the
two
others
is
essentially
of
a
narrative
character
and
sets
forth
with
full
sympathy
and
enjoyment
the
materials
handed
down
by
tradition
the
story
of
the
patriarchs
which
belongs
to
this
document
almost
entirely
is
what
best
marks
its
character
that
story
is
not
here
dealt
with
merely
as
a
summary
introduction
to
something
of
greater
importance
which
is
to
follow
but
as
a
subject
of
primary
importance
deserving
the
fullest
treatment
possible
legislative
elements
have
been
taken
into
it
only
at
one
point
where
they
fit
into
the
historical
connection
namely
when
the
giving
of
the
law
at
sinai
is
spoken
of
xxxiv
scholars
long
rested
satisfied
with
this
twofold
division
of
the
hexateuch
until
hupfeld
demonstrated
in
certain
parts
of
genesis
which
until
then
had
been
assigned
partly
to
the
main
stock
and
partly
to
the
jehovist
the
existence
of
a
third
continuous
source
the
work
of
the
younger
elohist
the
choice
of
this
name
was
due
to
the
circumstance
that
in
this
document
also
elohim
is
the
ordinary
name
of
the
deity
as
it
is
in
the
main
stock
up
to
exodus
vi
the
epithet
younger
however
is
better
left
out
as
it
involves
an
unproved
assumption
and
besides
is
no
longer
required
for
distinction
sake
now
that
the
main
stock
is
no
longer
referred
to
under
so
unsuitable
a
name
as
that
of
elohist
hupfeld
further
assumed
that
all
the
three
sources
continued
to
exist
separately
until
some
one
at
a
later
date
brought
them
together
simultaneously
into
a
single
whole
but
this
is
a
view
that
can
not
be
maintained
not
merely
is
the
elohist
in
his
matter
and
in
his
manner
of
looking
at
things
most
closely
akin
to
the
jehovist
his
document
has
come
down
to
us
as
noldeke
was
thc
first
to
perceive
only
in
extracts
embodied
in

thus
notwithstanding
hupfeld
discovery
the
old
division
into
two
great
sections
continues
to
hold
good
and
there
is
every
reason
for
adhering
to
this
primary
distinction
as
the
basis

historical
research
in

of
the

is

more
and

clearly
perceived
that
not

the
jehovistic
document
but
the

stock
as
well
are
complex
products
and
that
alongside
of
them
occur
hybrid
or
posthumous
elements
which
do
not
admit
of
being
simply
referred

either
the
one

i
do

way

the
literary

resulted
in

is
to
be
looked
at
in

i

altogether
welcome

as
they

from
some
relics
of
the
old
leaven
of
a
mechanical
separation
of
sources
which
had
continued
to
adhere
to
it
for
what
kuenen
points
out
is
that
certain
elements
assigned
by

to
the

are
not
fragments
of
a
once
independent
whole
but
interpolated
and
parasitic
additions
what
effect
this
demonstration
may
have
on
the
judgment
we
form
of

is

the

determine
is
the

stack
which
both
by
its
contents
and
by
its
origin
is
entitled
to
be
called
the
priestly
code
and
will
accordingly
be
so
designated
the
priestly
code
preponderates
over
the
rest
of
the
legislation
in
force
as
well
as
in
bulk
in
all
matters
of
primary
importance
it
is
the
normal
and
final
authority
it
was
according
to
the
mode
furnished
by
it
that
the
jews
under
ezra
ordered
their
sacred
community
and
upon
it
are
formed
our
conceptions
of
the
mosaic
theocracy
with
the
tabernacle
at
its
centre
the
high
priest
at
its
head
the
priests
and
levites
as
its
organs
the
legitimate
cultus
as
its
regular
function
it
is
precisely
this
law
so
called
par
exceilence
that
creates
the
difficulties
out
of
which
our
problem
rises
and
it
is
only
in
connection
with
it
that
the
great
difference
of
opinion
exists
as
to
date
with
regard
to
the
jehovistic
document
all
are
happily
agreed
that
substantially
at
all
events
in
language
horizon
and
other
features
it
dates
from
the
golden
age
of
hebrew
literature
to
which
the
finest
parts
of
judges
samuel
and
kings
and
the
oldest
extant
prophetical
writings
also
belong
the
period
of
the
kings
and
prophets
which
preceded
the
dissolution
of
the
two
israelite
kingdoms
by
the
assyrians
about
the
origin
of
deuteronomy
there
is
still
less
dispute
in
all
circles
where
appreciation
of
scientific
results
can
be
looked
for
at
all
it
is
recognised
that
it
was
composed
in
the
same
age
as
that
in
which
it
was
discovered
and
that
it
was
made
the
rule
of
josiah
reformation
which
took
place
about
a
generation
before
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
by
the
chaldaeans
it
is
only
in
the
case
of
the
priestly
code
that
opinions
differ
widely
for
it
tries
hard
to
imitate
the
costume
of
the
mosaic
period
and
with
whatever
success
to
disguise
its
own
this
is
not
nearly
so
much
the
case
with
deuteronomy
which
in
fact
allows
the
real
situation
that
of
the
period
during
which
samaria
having
been
destroyed
only
the
kingdom
of
judah
continued
to
subsist
to
reveal
itself
very
plainly
through
that
which
is
assumed
and
the
jehovist
does
not
even
pretend
to
being
a
mosaic
law
of
any
kind
it
aims
at
being
a
simple
book
of
history
the
distance
between
the
present
and
the
past
spoken
of
is
not
concealed
in
the
very
least
it
is
here
that
all
the
marks
are
found
which
attracted
the
attention
of
abenezra
and
afterwards
of
spinoza
such
as
xii
and
the
canaanite
was
then
in
the
land
these
are

kings
who
reigned
in
edom
before
the
children
of
israel
had
a
king
num
deut
there
arose
not
a
prophet
since
in
israel
like
unto
moses
the
priestly
code
on
the
other
hand
guards
itself
against
all
reference
to
later
times
and
settled
life
in
canaan
which
both
in
the
jehovistic
book
of
the
covenant
exodus
and
in
deuteronomy
are
the
express
basis
of
the
legislation
it
keeps
itself
carefully
and
strictly
within
the
limits
of
the
situation
in
the
wilderness
for
which
in
all
seriousness
it
seeks
to
give
the
law
it
has
actually
been
successful
with
its
movable
tabernacle
its
wandering
camp
and
other
archaic
details
in
so
concealing
the
true
date
of
its
composition
that
its
many
serious
inconsistencies
with
what
we
know
from
other
sources
of
hebrew
antiquity
previous
to
the
exile
are
only
taken
as
proving
that
it
lies
far
beyond
all
known
history
and
on
account
of
its
enormous
antiquity
can
hardly
be
brought
into
any
connection
with
it
it
is
the
priestly
code
then
that
presents
us
with
our
problem
the
instinct
was
a
sound
one
which
led
criticism
for
the
time
being
to
turn
aside
from
the
historical
problem
which
had
originally
presented
itself
to
de
wette
and
afterwards
had
been
more
distinctly
apprehended
by
george
and
vatke
in
order
in
the
first
instance
to
come
to
some
sort
of
clear
understanding
as
to
the
composition
of
the
pentateuch
but
a
mistake
was
committed
when
it
was
supposed
that
by
a
separation
of
the
sources
in
which
operation
attention
was
quite
properly
directed
chiefly
to
genesis
that
great
historical
question
had
been
incidentally
answered
the
fact
was
that
it
had
been
merely
put
to
sleep
and
graf
has
the
credit
of
having
after
a
considerable
interval
awakened
it
again
in
doing
so
indeed
he
in
turn
laboured
under
the
disadvantage
of
not
knowing
what
success
had
been
achieved
in
separating
the
sources
and
thereby
he
became
involved
in
a
desperate
and
utterly
untenable
assumption
this
assumption
however
had
no
necessary
connection
with
his
own
hypothesis
and
at
once
fell
to
the
ground
when
the
level
to
which
hupfeld
brought
the
criticism
of
the
text
had
been
reached
graf
originally
followed
the
older
view
espoused
by
tuch
in
particular
that
in
genesis
the
priestly
code
with
its
so
obtrusively
bare
skeleton
is
the
main
stock
and
that
it
is
the
jehovist
who
supplements
and
is
therefore
of
course
the
later
but
since
on
the
other
hand
he
regarded
the
ritual
legislature
of
the
middle
books
as
much
more
recent
than
the
work
of
the
jehovist
he
was
compelled
to
tear
it
asunder
as
best
he
could
from
its
introduction
in
genesis
and
to
separate
the
two
halves
of
the
priestly
code
by
half
a
millennium
but
hupfeld
had
long
before
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
jehovist
is
no
mere
supplementer
but
the
author
of
a
perfectly
independent
work
and
that
the
passages
such
as
gen
usually
cited
as
examples
of
the
way
in
which
the
jehovist
worked
over
the
main
stock
really
proceed
from
quite
another
source
the
elohist
thus
the
of
graf
had
already
been
taken
out
of
the
way
and
his
path
had
been
made
clear
by
an
ally
following
kuenen
suggestion
he
did
not
hesitate
to
take
the
extended
to
him
he
gave
up
his
violent
division
of
the
priestly
code
and
then
had
no
difficulty
in
deducing
from
the
results
which
he
had
obtained
with
respect
to
the

had
got
somewhat
settled
on
their
lees
they
raised
against
the
assailants
a
series
of
objections
all
of
which
however
laboured
more
or
less
under
the
disadvantage
that
they
rested
upon
the
foundation
which
had
already
been
shattered
passages
were
quoted
from
amos
and
hosea
as
implying
an
acquaintance
with
the
priestly
code
but
they
were
not
such
as
could
make
any
impression
on
those
who
were
already
persuaded
that
the
latter
was
the
more
recent
again
it
was
asserted
and
almost
with
violence
that
the
priestly
code
could
not
be
later
than
deuteronomy
and
that
the
deuteronomist
actually
had
it
before
him
but
the
evidences
of
this
proved
extremely
problematical
while
on
the
other
hand
the
dependence
of
deuteronomy
as
a
whole
on
the
jehovist
came
out
with
the
utmost
clearness
appeal
was
made
to
the
latest
redaction
of
the
entire
hexateuch
a
redaction
which
was
assumed
to
be
deuteronomistic
but
this
yielded
the
result
that
the
deuteronomistic
redaction
could
nowhere
be
traced
in
any
of
the
parts
belonging
to
the
priestly
code
even
the
history
of
the
language
itself
was
forced
to
render
service
against
graf
it
had
already
been
too
much
the
custom
to
deal
with
that
as
if
it
were
soft
wax
to
say
all
in
a
word
the
arguments
which
were
brought
into
play
as
a
rule
derived
all
their
force
from
a
moral
conviction
that
the
ritual
legislation
must
be
old
and
could
not
possibly
have
been
committed
to
writing
for
the
first
time
within
the
period
of
judaism
that
it
was
not
operative
before
then
that
it
did
not
even
admit
of
being
carried
into
effect
in
the
conditions
that
prevailed
previous
to
the
exile
could
not
shake
the
conviction
all
the
firmer
because
it
did
not
rest
on
argument
that
at
least
it
existed
previously
the
firemen
never
came
near
the
spot
where
the
conflagration
raged
for
it
is
only
within
the
region
of
religious
antiquities
and
dominant
religious
ideas
the
region
which
vatke
in
his
biblische
theologie
had
occupied
in
its
full
breadth
and
where
the
real
battle
first
kindled
that
the
controversy
can
be
brought
to
a
definite
issue
in
making
the
following
attempt
in
this
direction
i
start
from
the
comparison
of
the
three
constituents
of
the
pentateuch
the
priestly
code
deuteronomy
and
the
work
of
the
jehovist
the
contents
of
the
first
two
are
of
course
legislation
as
we
have
seen
those
of
the
third
are
narrative
but
as
the
decalogue
exodus
xx
the
law
of
the
two
tables
exodus
xxxiv
and
the
book
of
the
covenant
exodus
show
the
legislative
element
is
not
wholly
absent
from
the
jehovist
and
much
less
is
the
historical
absent
from
the
priestly
code
or
deuteronomy
further
each
writer
legal
standpoint
is
mirrored
in
his
account
of
the
history
and
conversely
thus
there
is
no
lack
either
of
indirect
or
of
direct
points
of
comparison
now
it
is
admitted
that
the
three
constituent
elements
are
separated
from
each
other
by
wide
intervals
the
question
then
arises
in
what
order
deuteronomy
stands
in
a
relation
of
comparative
nearness
both
to
the
jehovist
and
to
the
priestly
code
the
distance
between
the
last
two
is
by
far
the
greatest
so
great
that
on
this
ground
alone
ewald
as
early
as
the
year
stud
u
declared
it
impossible
that
the
one
could
have
been
written
to
supplement
the
other
combining
this
observation
with
the
undisputed
priority
of
the
jehovist
over
deuteronomy
it
will
follow
that
the
priestly
code
stands
last
in
the
series
but
such
a
consideration
although
so
far
as
i
know
proceeding
upon
admitted
data
has
no
value
as
long
as
it
confines
itself
to
such
mere
generalities
it
is
necessary
to
trace
the
succession
of
the
three
elements
in
detail
and
at
once
to
test
and
to
fix
each
by
reference
to
an
independent
standard
namely
the
inner
development
of
the
history
of
israel
so
far
as
that
is
known
to
us
by
trustworthy
testimonies
from
independent
sources
the
literary
and
historical
investigation
on
which
we
thus
enter
is
both
wide
and
difficult
it
falls
into
three
parts
in
the
first
which
lays
the
foundations
the
data
relating
to
sacred
archaeology
are
brought
together
and
arranged
in
such
a
way
as
to
show
that
in
the
pentateuch
the
elements
follow
upon
one
another
and
from
one
another
precisely
as
the
steps
of
the
development
demonstrably
do
in
the
history
almost
involuntarily
this
argument
has
taken
the
shape
of
a
sort
of
history
of
the
ordinances
of
worship
rude
and
colourless
that
history
must
be
confessed
to
be
a
fault
due
to
the
materials
which
hardly
allow
us
to
do
more
than
mark
the
contrast
between
and
and
in
a
secondary
measure
that
between
deuteronomic
and
at
the
same
time
there
is
this
advantage
arising
out
of
the
breadth
of
the
periods
treated
they
can
not
fail
to
distinguish
themselves
from
each
other
in
a
tangible
manner
it
must
be
possible
in
the
case
of
historical
and
even
of
legal
works
to
recognise
whether
they
were
written
before
or
after
the
exile
the
second
part
in
many
respects
dependent
on
the
first
traces
the
influence
of
the
successively
prevailing
ideas
and
tendencies
upon
the
shaping
of
historical
tradition
and
follows
the
various
phases
in
which
that
was
conceived
and
set
forth
it
contains
so
to
speak
a
history
of
tradition
the
third
part
sums
up
the
critical
results
of
the
preceding
two
with
some
further
determining
considerations
and
concludes
with
a
more
general
survey
the
assumptions
i
make
will
find
an
justification
in
the
course
of
the
investigation
the
two
principal
are
that
the
work
of
the
jehovist
so
far
as
the
nucleus
of
it
is
concerned
belongs
to
the
course
of
the
assyrian
period
and
that
deuteronomy
belongs
to
its
close
moreover
however
strongly
i
am
convinced
that
the
latter
is
to
be
dated
in
accordance
with
i
do
not
like
graf
so
use
this
position
as
to
make
it
the
fulcrum
for
my
lever
deuteronomy
is
the
not
in
the
sense
that
without
it
it
would
be
impossible
to
accomplish
anything
but
only
because
when
its
position
has
been
historically
ascertained
we
can
not
decline
to
go
on
but
must
demand
that
the
position
of
the
priestly
code
should
also
be
fixed
by
reference
to
history
my
inquiry
proceeds
on
a
broader
basis
than
that
of
graf
and
comes
nearer
to
that
of
vatke
from
whom
indeed
i
gratefully
acknowledge
myself
to
have
learnt
best
and
most
a
history
of
the
ordinances
of
legem
non
habentes
natura
faciunt
legis
opera
romans
ii
when
gentiles
who
do
not
have
the
law
do
instinctively
what
the
law
requires
romans
nrsv
chapter
i
the
place
of
worship
as
we
learn
from
the
new
testament
the
jews
and
the
samaritans
in
the
days
of
jesus
were
not
agreed
on
the
question
which
was
the
proper
place
of
worship
but
that
there
could
be
only
one
was
taken
to
be
as
certain
as
the
unity
of
god
himself
the
jews
maintained
that
place
to
be
the
temple
at
jerusalem
and
when
it
was
destroyed
they
ceased
to
sacrifice
but
this
oneness
of
the
sanctuary
in
israel
was
not
originally
recognised
either
in
fact
or
in
law
it
was
a
slow
growth
of
time
with
the
help
of
the
old
testament
we
are
still
quite
able
to
trace
the
process
in
doing
so
it
is
possible
to
distinguish
several
stages
of
development
we
shall
accordingly
proceed
to
inquire
whether
the
three
constituent
parts
of
the
pentateuch
give
tokens
of
any
relationship
to
one
or
other
of
these
whether
and
how
they
fall
in
with
the
course
of
the
historical
development
which
we
are
able
to
follow
by
the
aid
of
the
historical
and
prophetic
books
from
the
period
of
the
judges
onwards
for
the
earliest
period
of
the
history
of
israel
all
that
precedes
the
building
of
the
temple
not
a
trace
can
be
found
of
any
sanctuary
of
exclusive
legitimacy
in
the
books
of
judges
and
samuel
hardly
a
place
is
mentioned
at
which
we
have
not
at
least
casual
mention
of
an
altar
and
of
sacrifice
in
great
measure
this
multiplicity
of
sanctuaries
was
part
of
the
heritage
taken
over
from
the
canaanites
by
the
hebrews
as
they
appropriated
the
towns
and
the
culture
generally
of
the
previous
inhabitants
so
also
did
they
take
possession
of
their
sacred
piaces
the
system
of
high
places
bamoth
with
all
the
apparatus
thereto
belonging
is
certainly
canaanite
originally
deut
num
exodus
seq
but
afterwards
is
of
quite
general
occurrence
among
the
hebrews
at
shechem
and
gibeon
the
transition
takes
place
almost
in
the
full
light
of
history
some
other
places
of
worship
certain
of
which
are
afterwards
represented
as
levitical
towns
betray
their
origin
by
their
names
at
least
bethshemesh
or
ir
heres
and
ashtaroth
karnaim
the
astarte
in
the
popular
recollection
also
the
memory
of
the
fact
that
many
of
the
most
prominent
sacrificial
seats
were
already
in
existence
at
the
date
of
the
immigration
continues
to
survive
shechem
bethel
beersheba
figure
in
genesis
as
instituted
by
the
patriarchs
other
equally
important
holy
sites
not
so
the
reason
for
the
distinction
can
only
lie
in
a
consciousness
of
the
more
recent
origin
of
the
latter
those
of
the
one
class
had
been
found
by
the
people
when
they
came
those
of
the
other
category
they
had
themselves
established
for
of
course
if
the
hebrews
did
not
hesitate
to
appropriate
to
themselves
the
old
holy
places
of
the
country
neither
did
they
feel
any
difficulty
in
instituting
new
ones
in
gilgal
and
shiloh
in
the
fixed
camps
where
in
the
first
instance
they
had
found
a
permanent
foothold
in
palestine
proper
there
forthwith
arose
important
centres
of
worship
so
likewise
in
other
places
of
political
importance
even
in
such
as
only
temporarily
come
into
prominence
as
ophrah
ramah
and
nob
near
gibeah
and
apart
from
the
greater
cities
with
their
more
or
less
regular
religious
service
it
is
perfectly
permissible
to
erect
an
altar
extempore
and
offer
sacrifice
wherever
an
occasion
presents
itself
when
after
the
battle
of
michmash
the
people
tired
and
hungry
fell
upon
the
cattle
they
had
taken
and
began
to
devour
the
flesh
with
the
blood
that
is
without
pouring
out
the
blood
on
the
altar
saul
caused
a
great
stone
to
be
erected
and
ordered
that
every
man
should
slaughter
his
ox
or
his
sheep
there
this
was
the
first
altar
which
saul
erected
to
jehovah
adds
the
narrator
certainly
not
as
a
reproach
nor
even
to
signalise
his
conduct
as
anything
surprising
or
exceptional
the
instance
is
all
the
more
instructive
because
it
shows
how
the
prohibition
to
eat
flesh
without
rendering
the
blood
back
to
god
at
a
time
when
the
people
did
not
live
crowded
together
within
a
quite
limited
area
necessarily
presupposed
liberty
to
sacrifice
anywhere
or
to
slaughter
anywhere
for
originally
the
two
words
are
absolutely
synonymous
it
need
not
be
said
that
the
sacrificial
seats
even
when
the
improvised
ones
are
left
out
of
account
were
not
all
alike
in
the
regard
in
which
they
were
held
or
in
the
frequency
with
which
they
were
resorted
to
besides
purely
local
ones
there
were
others
to
which
pilgrimages
were
made
from
far
and
near
towards
the
close
of
the
period
of
the
judges
shiloh
appears
to
have
acquired
an
importance
that
perhaps
extended
even
beyond
the
limits
of
the
tribe
of
joseph
by
a
later
age
the
temple
there
was
even
regarded
as
the
prototype
of
the
temple
of
solomon
that
is
as
the
one
legitimate
place
of
worship
to
which
jehovah
had
made
a
grant
of
all
the
of
the
children
of
israel
jer
ii
but
in
fact
if
a
prosperous
man
of
ephraim
or
benjamin
made
a
pilgrimage
to
the
joyful
festival
at
shiloh
at
the
turn
of
the
year
the
reason
for
his
doing
so
was
not
that
he
could
have
had
no
opportunity
at
his
home
in
ramah
or
gibeah
for
eating
and
drinking
before
the
lord
any
strict
centralisation
is
for
that
period
inconceivable
alike
in
the
religious
as
in
every
other
sphere
this
is
seen
even
in
the
circumstance
that
the
destruction
of
the
temple
of
shiloh
the
priesthood
of
which
we
find
officiating
at
nob
a
little
later
did
not
exercise
the
smallest
modifying
influence
upon
the
character
and
position
of
the
cultus
shiloh
disappears
quietly
from
the
scene
and
is
not
mentioned
again
until
we
learn
from
jeremiah
that
at
least
from
the
time
when
solomon
temple
was
founded
its
temple
lay
in
ruins
for
the
period
during
which
the
temple
of
jerusalem
was
not
yet
in
existence
even
the
latest
redaction
of
the
historical
books
which
perhaps
does
not
everywhere
proceed
from
the
same
hand
but
all
dates
from
the
same
period
that
of
the
babylonian
exile
and
has
its
origin
in
the
same
spirit
leaves
untouched
the
multiplicity
of
altars
and
of
holy
places
no
king
after
solomon
is
left
uncensured
for
having
tolerated
the
high
places
but
samuel
is
permitted
in
his
proper
person
to
preside
over
a
sacrificial
feast
at
the
bamah
of
his
native
town
and
solomon
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
to
institute
a
similar
one
at
the
great
bamah
of
gibeon
without
being
blamed
the
offensive
name
is
again
and
again
employed
in
the
most
innocent
manner
in
and
the
later
editors
allow
it
to
pass
unchallenged
the
principle
which
guides
this
apparently
unequal
distribution
of
censure
becomes
clear
from
iii
the
people
sacrificed
upon
the
high
places
for
as
yet
no
house
to
the
name
of
jehovah
had
been
built
not
until
the
house
had
been
built
to
the
name
of
jehovah
such
is
the
idea
did
the
law
come
into
force
which
forbade
having
other
places
of
worship
compare
viii
according
to
deut
the
local
unity
of
worship
becomes
law
from
the
time
when
the
israelites
have
found
rest
menuha
comparing
and
we
find
that
menuha
first
came
in
with
david
and
solomon
the
period
of
the
judges
must
at
that
time
have
been
regarded
as
much
shorter
than
appears
in
the
present
chronology
from
the
building
of
the
temple
of
solomon
which
is
also
treated
as
a
leading
epoch
in
chronology
a
new
period
in
the
history
of
worship
is
accordingly
dated
and
to
a
certain
extent
with
justice
the
monarchy
in
israel
owed
its
origin
to
the
need
which
under
severe
external
pressure
had
come
to
be
felt
for
bringing
together
into
the
oneness
of
a
people
and
a
kingdom
the
hitherto
very
loosely
connected
tribes
and
families
of
the
hebrews
it
had
an
avowedly
centralising
tendency
which
very
naturally
laid
hold
of
the
cultus
as
an
appropriate
means
for
the
attainment
of
the
political
end
gideon
even
the
first
who
came
near
a
regal
position
erected
a
costly
sanctuary
in
his
city
ophrah
david
caused
the
ark
of
jehovah
to
be
fetched
into
his
fortress
on
mount
sion
and
attached
value
to
the
circumstance
of
having
for
its
priest
the
representative
of
the
old
family
which
had
formerly
kept
it
at
shiloh
solomon
temple
also
was
designed
to
increase
the
attractiveness
of
the
city
of
his
residence
it
is
indubitable
that
in
this
way
political
centralisation
gave
an
impulse
to
a
greater
centralisation
of
worship
also
and
the
tendency
towards
the
latter
continued
to
operate
after
the
separation
of
the
two
kingdoms
in
israel
not
quite
in
the
same
manner
as
in
judah
royal
priests
great
national
temples
festal
gatherings
of
the
whole
people
sacrifices
on
an
enormous
scale
these
were
the
traits
by
which
the
cultus
previously
as
it
would
seem
very
simple
now
showed
the
impress
of
a
new
time
one
other
fact
is
significant
the
domestic
feasts
and
sacrifices
of
single
families
which
in
david
time
must
still
have
been
general
gradually
declined
and
lost
their
importance
as
social
circles
widened
and
life
became
more
public
but
this
way
of
regarding
the
influence
of
the
monarchy
upon
the
history
of
the
worship
is
not
that
of
the
author
of
the
books
of
kings
he
views
the
temple
of
solomon
as
a
work
undertaken
exclusively
in
the
interests
of
pure
worship
and
as
differing
entirely
in
origin
from
the
sacred
buildings
of
the
kings
of
israel
with
which
accordingly
it
is
not
compared
but
contrasted
as
the
genuine
is
contrasted
with
the
spurious
it
is
in
its
nature
unique
and
from
the
outset
had
the
design
of
setting
aside
all
other
holy
places
a
religious
design
independent
of
and
unconnected
with
politics
the
view
however
is
unhistorical
it
carries
back
to
the
original
date
of
the
temple
and
imports
into
the
purpose
of
its
foundation
the
significance
which
it
had
acquired
in
judah
shortly
before
the
exile
in
reality
the
temple
was
not
at
the
outset
all
that
it
afterwards
became
its
influence
was
due
to
its
own
weight
and
not
to
a
monopoly
conferred
by
solomon
we
nowhere
learn
that
that
king
like
a
forerunner
of
josiah
in
order
to
favour
his
new
sanctuary
sought
to
abolish
all
the
others
there
is
not
the
faintest
historical
trace
of
any
such
sudden
and
violent
interference
with
the
previously
existing
arrangements
of
worship
never
once
did
solomon
successors
confined
though
they
were
to
the
little
territory
of
judah
and
therefore
in
a
position
in
which
the
experiment
might
perhaps
have
been
practicable
make
the
attempt
which
certainly
would
have
been
in
their
interest
to
concentrate
all
public
worship
within
their
own
temple
though
in
other
directions
we
find
them
exercising
a
very
arbitrary
control
over
affairs
of
religion
the
high
places
were
not
removed
this
is
what
is
regularly
told
us
in
the
case
of
them
all
for
israel
properly
so
called
jerusalem
was
at
no
time
properly
speaking
the
place
which
jehovah
had
chosen
least
of
all
was
it
so
after
the
division
of
the
kingdom
the
ephraimites
flocked
in
troops
through
the
entire
length
of
the
southern
kingdom
as
pilgrims
to
beersheba
and
in
common
with
the
men
of
judah
to
gilgal
on
the
frontier
jerusalem
they
left
unvisited
in
their
own
land
they
served
jehovah
at
bethel
and
dan
at
shechem
and
samaria
at
penuel
and
mizpah
and
at
many
other
places
every
town
had
its
bamah
in
the
earlier
times
generally
on
an
open
site
at
the
top
of
the
hill
on
the
slopes
of
which
the
houses
were
elijah
that
great
zealot
for
purity
of
worship
was
so
far
from
being
offended
by
the
high
places
and
the
multiplicity
of
altars
to
jehovah
that
their
destruction
brought
bitterness
to
his
soul
as
the
height
of
wickedness
and
with
his
own
hand
he
rebuilt
the
altar
that
had
fallen
into
ruins
on
mount
carmel
and
that
the
improvised
offering
on
extraordinary
occasions
had
also
not
fallen
into
disuse
is
shown
by
the
case
of
elisha
who
when
his
call
came
as
he
was
following
the
plough
hewed
his
oxen
to
pieces
on
the
spot
and
sacrificed
in
this
respect
matters
after
the
building
of
solomon
temple
continued
to
be
just
as
they
had
been
before
if
people
and
judges
or
kings
alike
priests
and
prophets
men
like
samuel
and
elijah
sacrificed
without
hesitation
whenever
occasion
and
opportunity
presented
themselves
it
is
manifest
that
during
the
whole
of
that
period
nobody
had
the
faintest
suspicion
that
such
conduct
was
heretical
and
forbidden
if
a
theophany
made
known
to
joshua
the
sanctity
of
gilgal
gave
occasion
to
gideon
and
manoah
to
rear
altars
at
their
homes
drew
the
attention
of
david
to
the
of
araunah
jehovah
himself
was
regarded
as
the
proper
founder
of
all
these
sanctuaries
and
this
not
merely
at
the
period
of
the
judges
but
more
indubitably
still
at
that
of
the
narrator
of
these
legends
he
rewarded
solomon
first
sacrifice
on
the
great
bamah
at
gibeon
with
a
gracious
revelation
and
can
not
therefore
have
been
displeased
by
it
after
all
this
it
is
absurd
to
speak
of
any
want
of
legality
in
what
was
then
the
ordinary
practice
throughout
the
whole
of
the
earlier
period
of
the
history
of
israel
the
restriction
of
worship
to
a
single
selected
place
was
unknown
to
any
one
even
as
a
pious
desire
men
believed
themselves
indeed
to
be
nearer
god
at
bethel
or
at
jerusalem
than
at
any
indifferent
place
but
of
such
gates
of
heaven
there
were
several
and
after
all
the
ruling
idea
was
that
which
finds
its
most
distinct
expression
in
that
palestine
as
a
whole
was
jehovah
house
his
ground
and
territory
not
outside
of
jerusalem
but
outside
of
canaan

one
to
sojourn
far
from
his
presence
under
the
dominion
and
cujus
regio
ejus
religio
in
the
service
of
strange
gods
the
sanctity
of
the
land
did
not
depend
on
that
of
the
temple
the
reverse
was
the
case
when
cain
is
driven
out
of
the
land
canaan
he
is
driven
from
the
presence
of
jehovah
jonah

is
also
possible
that
the
great
indignation
of
is
regarded
less
as
jehovah
than
as
that
of
chemosh
in
whose
land
the
army
of
israel
is
at
the
time
a
change
in
this
respect
first
begins
to
be
prepared
at
that
important
epoch
of
the
religious
history
of
israel
which
is
marked
by
the
fall
of
samaria
and
the
rise
of
the
prophets
connected
therewith
amos
and
hosea
presuppose
a
condition
of
matters
just
such
as
has
been
described
everywhere
in
the
towns
on
the
mountains
under
green
trees
a
multitude
of
sanctuaries
and
altars
at
which
jehovah
is
served
in
good
faith
not
with
the
purpose
of
provoking
him
but
in
order
to
gain
his
favour
the
language
held
by
these
men
was
one
hitherto
unheard
of
when
they
declared
that
gilgal
and
bethel
and
beersheba
favourite
seats
were
an
abomination
to
him
that
the
gifts
and
offerings
with
which
he
was
honoured
there
kindled
his
wrath
instead
of
appeasing
it
that
israel
was
destined
to
be
buried
under
the
ruins
of
his
temples
where
protection
and
refuge
were
sought
amos
what
did
they
mean
it
would
be
to
misunderstand
the
prophets
to
suppose
that
they
took
offence
at
the
holy
places
which
amos
still
calls
bamoth
and
that
too
not
in
scorn
but
with
the
deepest
pathos
in
and
by
themselves
on
account
of
their
being
more
than
one
or
not
being
the
right
ones
their
zeal
is
directed
not
against
the
places
but
against
the
cultus
there
carried
on
and
in
fact
not
merely
against
its
false
character
as
containing
all
manner
of
abuses
but
almost
more
against
itself
against
the
false
value
attached
to
it
the
common
idea
was
that
just
as
moab
showed
itself
to
be
the
people
of
chemosh
because
it
brought
to
chemosh
its
offerings
and
gifts
so
israel
proved
itself
jehovah
people
by
dedicating
its
worship
to
him
and
was
such
all
the
more
surely
as
its
worship
was
zealous
and
splendid
in
times
of
danger
and
need
when
his
help
was
peculiarly
required
the
zeal
of
the
worshippers
was
doubled
and
trebled
it
is
against
this
that
the
prophets
raise
their
protest
while
they
demand
quite
other
performances
as
a
living
manifestation
of
the
relation
of
israel
to
jehovah
this
was
the
reason
of
their
so
great
hostility
to
the
cultus
and
the
source
of
their
antipathy
to
the
great
sanctuaries
where
superstitious
zeal
outdid
itself
it
was
this
that
provoked
their
wrath
against
the
multiplicity
of
the
altars
which
flourished
so
luxuriantly
on
the
soil
of
a
false
confidence
that
the
holy
places
should
be
abolished
but
the
cultus
itself
remain
as
before
the
main
concern
of
religion
only
limited
to
a
single
locality
was
by
no
means
their
wish
but
at
the
same
time
in
point
of
fact
it
came
about
as
an
incidental
result
of
their
teaching
that
the
high
place
in
jerusalem
ultimately
abolished
all
the
other
bamoth
external
circumstances
it
must
be
added
contributed
most
essentially
towards
the
result
as
long
as
the
northern
kingdom
stood
it
was
there
that
the
main
current
of
lsraelite
life
manifested
itself
a
glance
into
the
books
of
kings
or
into
that
of
amos
is
enough
to
make
this
clear
in
jerusalem
indeed
the
days
of
david
and
of
solomon
remained
unforgotten
yearning
memories
went
back
to
them
and
great
pretensions
were
based
upon
them
but
with
these
the
actual
state
of
matters
only
faintly
corresponded
when
samaria
fell
israel
shrivelled
up
to
the
narrow
dimensions
of
judah
which
alone
survived
as
the
people
of
jehovah
thereby
the
field
was
left
clear
for
jerusalem
the
royal
city
had
always
had
a
weighty
preponderance
over
the
little
kingdom
and
within
it
again
the
town
had
yielded
in
importance
to
the
temple
from
the
few
narratives
we
have
relating
to
judah
one
almost
gathers
an
impression
as
if
it
had
no
other
concern
besides
those
of
the
temple
the
kings
in
particular
appear
to
have
regarded
the
charge
of
their
palace
sanctuary
as
the
chief
of
all
their
nearly
all
the
judaean
narratives
in
the
books
of
kings
relate
to
the
temple
and
the
measures
taken
by
the
ruling
princes
with
reference
to
this
their
sanctuary
in
this
way
the
increased
importance
of
judah
after
the
fall
of
samaria
accrued
in
the
first
instance
to
the
benefit
of
the
capital
and
its
sanctuary
especially
as
what
judah
gained
by
the
fall
of
her
rival
was
not
so
much
political
strength
as
an
increase
of
religious
if
the
great
house
of
god
upon
mount
zion
had
always
overtopped
the
other
shrines
in
judah
it
now
stood
without
any
equal
in
all
israel
but
it
was
the
prophets
who
led
the
way
in
determining
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
the
change
in
the
face
of
things
hitherto
they
had
principally
had
their
eyes
upon
the
northern
kingdom
its
threatened
collapse
and
the
wickedness
of
its
inhabitants
and
thus
had
poured
out
their
wrath
more
particularly
upon
the
places
of
worship
there
judah
they
judged
more
favourably
both
on
personal
and
on
substantial
grounds
and
they
hoped
for
its
preservation
not
concealing
their
sympathies
for
jerusalem
amos
under
the
impression
produced
by
their
discourses
accordingly
the
fall
of
samaria
was
interpreted
as
a
judgment
of
god
against
the
sinful
kingdom
and
in
favour
of
the
fallen
house
of
david
and
the
destruction
of
the
sanctuaries
of
israel
was
accepted
as
an
unmistakable
declaration
on
jehovah
part
against
his
older
seats
on
behalf
of
his
favourite
dwelling
on
zion
finally
the
fact
that
twenty
years
afterwards
jerusalem
made
her
triumphant
escape
from
the
danger
which
had
proved
fatal
to
her
haughty
rival
that
at
the
critical
moment
the
assyrians
under
sennacherib
were
suddenly
constrained
to
withdraw
from
her
raised
to
the
highest
pitch
the
veneration
in
which
the
temple
was
held
in
this
connection
special
emphasis
is
usually
laid
and
with
justice
upon
the
prophetical
activity
of
isaiah
whose
confidence
in
the
firm
foundation
of
zion
continued
unmoved
even
when
the
rock
began
to
shake
in
an
alarming
way
only
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
significance
of
jerusalem
to
isaiah
did
not
arise
from
the
temple
of
solomon
but
from
the
fact
that
it
was
the
city
of
david
and
the
focus
of
his
kingdom
the
central
point
not
of
the
cultus
but
of
the
sovereignty
of
jehovah
over
his
people
the
holy
mount
was
to
him
the
entire
city
as
a
political
unity
with
its
citizens
councillors
and
judges
his
faith
in
the
sure
foundation
on
which
zion
rested
was
nothing
more
than
a
faith
in
the
living
presence
of
jehovah
in
the
camp
of
israel
but
the
contemporaries
of
the
prophet
interpreted
otherwise
his
words
and
the
events
which
had
occurred
in
their
view
jehovah
dwelt
on
zion
because
his
house
was
there
it
was
the
temple
that
had
been
shown
by
history
to
be
his
true
seat
and
its
inviolability
was
accordingly
the
pledge
of
the
indestructibility
of
the
nation
this
belief
was
quite
general
in
jeremiah
time
as
is
seen
in
the
extremely
vivid
picture
of
the
seventh
chapter
of
his
book
but
even
as
early
as
the
time
of
micah
in
the
first
third
of
the
seventh
century
the
temple
must
have
been
reckoned
a
house
of
god
of
an
altogether
peculiar
order
so
as
to
make
it
a
paradox
to
put
it
on
a
level
with
the
bamoth
of
judah
and
a
thing
unheard
of
to
believe
in
its
destruction
at
the
same
time
notwithstanding
the
high
and
universal
reverence
in
which
the
temple
was
held
the
other
sanctuaries
still
continued
in
the
first
instance
to
subsist
alongside
of
it
king
hezekiah
indeed
is
said
to
have
even
then
made
an
attempt
to
abolish
them
but
the
attempt
having
passed
away
without
leaving
any
trace
is
of
a
doubtful
nature
it
is
certain
that
the
prophet
isaiah
did
not
labour
for
the
removal
of
the
bamoth
in
one
of
his
latest
discourses
his
anticipation
for
that
time
of
righteousness
and
the
fear
of
god
which
is
to
dawn
after
the
assyrian
crisis
is
then
shall
ye
defile
the
silver
covering
of
your
graven
images
and
the
golden
plating
of
your
molten
images
ye
shall
cast
them
away
as
a
thing
polluted
begone
shall
ye
say
unto
them
if
he
thus
hopes
for
a
purification
from
superstitious
accretions
of
the
places
where
jehovah
is
worshipped
it
is
clear
that
he
is
not
thinking
of
their
total
abolition
not
until
about
a
century
after
the
destruction
of
samaria
did
men
venture
to
draw
the
practical
conclusion
from
the
belief
in
the
unique
character
of
the
temple
at
jerusalem
that
this
was
not
done
from
a
mere
desire
to
be
logical
but
with
a
view
to
further
reforms
need
not
be
said
with
the
tone
of
repudiation
in
which
the
earlier
prophets
in
the
zeal
of
their
opposition
had
occasionally
spoken
of
practices
of
worship
at
large
there
was
nothing
to
be
achieved
the
thing
to
be
aimed
at
was
not
abolition
but
reformation
and
the
end
it
was
believed
would
be
helped
by
concentration
of
all
ritual
in
the
capital
prophets
and
priests
appear
to
have
made
common
cause
in
the
prosecution
of
the
work
it
was
the
high
priest
hilkiah
who
in
the
first
instance
called
attention
to
the
discovered
book
which
was
to
be
made
the
basis
of
action
the
prophetess
huldah
confirmed
its
divine
contents
the
priests
and
prophets
were
a
prominent
element
in
the
assembly
at
which
the
new
law
was
promulgated
and
sworn
to
now
an
intimate
fellowship
between
these
two
leading
classes
appears
to
be
characteristic
of
the
whole
course
of
the
religious
movement
in
judah
and
to
have
been
necessarily
connected
with
the
lines
on
which
that
movement
advanced
while
hosea
the
man
of
northern
israel
frequently
assails
the
clergy
of
his
home
and
lays
upon
them
the
chief
share
of
the
blame
for
the
depraved
and
blinded
condition
of
the
people
isaiah
even
in
his
fiercest
declamation
against
the
superstitious
worship
of
the
multitude
has
not
a
word
to
say
against
the
priests
with
whose
chief
uriah
on
the
contrary
he
stands
in
a
relation
of
great
intimacy
but
it
is
from
the
book
of
jeremiah
the
best
mirror
of
the
contemporary
relations
in
judah
that
the
close
connection
between
priests
and
prophets
can
be
gathered
most
particularly
to
a
certain
extent
they
shared
the
possession
of
the
sanctuary
between
them
compare
lam
we
shall
be
justified
therefore
in
assuming
that
the
display
of
harmony
between
them
on
this
occasion
was
not
got
up
merely
for
the
purposes
of
scenic
effect
but
that
the
change
in
the
national
cultus
now
proposed
was
really
the
common
suggestion
of
prophets
and
priests
in
point
of
fact
such
a
change
was
equally
in
accordance
with
the
interests
of
the
temple
and
with
those
of
the
prophetic
party
of
reform
to
the
last
named
the
restriction
of
the
sacrificial
worship
must
have
in
itself
seemed
an
advantage
to
it
in
later
times
the
complete
abolition
of
sacrifice
was
mainly
due
and
something
of
the
later
effect
doubtless
lay
in
the
original
intention
then
too
the
jehovah
of
hebron
was
only
too
easily
regarded
as
distinct
from
the
jehovah
of
bethshemesh
or
of
bethel
and
so
a
strictly
monarchical
conception
of
god
naturally
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
place
of
his
dwelling
and
of
his
worship
could
also
only
be
one
all
writers
of
the
chaldaean
period
associate
monotheism
in
the
closest
way
with
unity
of
worship
jer
and
the
choice
of
the
locality
could
present
no
difficulty
the
central
point
of
the
kingdom
had
of
necessity
also
to
become
the
central
point
of
the
worship
even
jerusalem
and
the
house
of
jehovah
there
might
need
some
cleansing
but
it
was
clearly
entitled
to
a
preference
over
the
obscure
local
altars
it
was
the
seat
of
all
higher
culture
iying
under
the
prophets
eyes
much
more
readily
accessible
to
light
and
air
reform
and
control
it
is
also
possible
moreover
that
the
canaanite
origin
of
most
of
the
bamoth
which
is
not
unknown
for
example
to
deuteronomy
may
have
helped
to
discredit
them
while
on
the
other
hand
the
founding
of
jerusalem
belonged
to
the
proudest
memories
of
israelite
history
and
the
ark
which
had
been
the
origin
of
the
temple
there
had
a
certain
right
to
be
considered
the

luther

his
address

and

be
destroyed
as
devices
of
the
devil
used
by
him
to
strengthen
covetousness
to
set
up
a
false
and
spurious
faith
to
weaken
parochial
churches
to
increase

no
purpose

niemeyer
reprint
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
josiah
the
first
heavy
blow
fell
upon
the
local
sacrificial
places
how
vigorously
the
king
set
to
work
how
new
were
the
measures
taken
and
how
deeply
they
cut
can
be
learned
from
the
narrative
of
xxiii
yet
what
a
vitality
did
the
green
trees
upon
the
high
mountains
still
continue
to
show
even
now
they
were
but
polled
not
uprooted
after
josiah
death
we
again
see
bamoth
appearing
on
all
hands
not
merely
in
the
country
but
even
in
the
capital
itself
jeremiah
has
to
lament
that
there
are
as
many
altars
as
towns
in
judah
all
that
had
been
attained
by
the
reforming
party
was
that
they
could
now
appeal
to
a
written
law
that
had
been
solemnly
sworn
to
by
the
whole
people
standing
ever
an
immovable
witness
to
the
rights
of
god
but
to
bring
it
again
into
force
and
to
carry
it
out
was
no
easy
matter
and
would
certainly
have
been
impossible
to
the
unaided
efforts
of
the
prophets
a
jeremiah
or
an
ezekiel
had
the
people
of
judah
remained
in
peaceful
possession
of
their
land
the
reformation
of
josiah
would
hardly
have
penetrated
to
the
masses
the
threads
uniting
the
present
with
the
past
were
too
strong
to
induce
the
people
to
regard
as
idolatrous
and
heretical
centres
of
iniquity
the
bamoth
with
which
from
ancestral
times
the
holiest
memories
were
associated
and
some
of
which
like
hebron
and
beersheba
had
been
set
up
by
abraham
and
isaac
in
person
required
a
complete
of
the
natural
tradition
of
life
a
total
severance
of
all
connection
with
inherited
conditions
this
was
accomplished
by
means
of
the
babylonian
exile
which
violently
tore
the
nation
away
from
its
native
soil
and
kept
it
apart
for
half
a
century
a
breach
of
historical
continuity
than
which
it
is
almost
impossible
to
conceive
a
greater
the
new
generation
had
no
natural
but
only
an
artificial
relation
to
the
times
of
old
the
firmly
rooted
growths
of
the
old
soil
regarded
as
thorns
by
the
pious
were
extirpated
and
the
freshly
ploughed
fallows
ready
for
a
new
sowing
it
is
of
course
far
from
being
the
case
that
the
whole
people
at
that
time
underwent
a
general
conversion
in
the
sense
of
the
prophets
perhaps
the
majority
totally
gave
up
the
past
but
just
on
that
account
became
lost
among
the
heathen
and
never
subsequently
came
into
notice
only
the
pious
ones
who
with
trembling
followed
jehovah
word
were
left
as
a
remnant
they
alone
had
the
strength
to
maintain
the
jewish
individuality
amid
the
medley
of
nationalities
into
which
they
had
been
thrown
from
the
exile
there
returned
not
the
nation
but
a
religious
sect
those
namely
who
had
given
themselves
up
body
and
soul
to
the
reformation
ideas
it
is
no
wonder
that
to
these
people
who
besides
on
their
return
all
settled
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
jerusalem
the
thought
never
once
occurred
of
restoring
the
local
cults
it
cost
them
no
struggle
to
allow
the
destroyed
bamoth
to
continue
iying
in
ruins
the
principle
had
become
part
of
their
very
being
that
the
one
god
had
also
but
one
place
of
worship
and
thenceforward
for
all
time
coming
this
was
regarded
as
a
thing
of
course
such
was
the
actual
historical
course
of
the
centralisation
of
the
cultus
and
such
the
three
stadia
which
can
be
distinguished
the
question
now
presents
itself
whether
it
is
possible
to
detect
a
correspondence
between
the
phases
of
the
actual
course
of
events
and
those
of
the
legislation
relating
to
this
subject
all
three
portions
of
the
legislation
contain
ordinances
on
the
subject
of
sacrificial
places
and
offerings
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
in
some
way
or
other
these
have
their
roots
in
history
and
do
not
merely
hang
in
the
air
quite
away
from
or
above
the
solid
ground
of
actuality
the
main
jehovistic
law
the
book
of
the
covenant
contains
exodus
the
following
ordinance
an
altar
of
earth
shalt
thou
make
unto
me
and
thereon
shalt
thou
sacrifice
thy
burnt
offerings
and
thy
thy
sheep
and
thine
oxen
in
place
where
i
cause
my
name
to
be
honoured
will
i
come
unto
and
will
bless
thee
or
if
thou
wilt
make
me
an
altar
of
stones
thou
shalt
not
build
it
of
hewn
stones
for
if
thou
hast
lifted
up
thy
tool
upon
it
thou
hast
polluted
it
and
thou
shalt
not
go
up
to
mine
altar
by
steps
that
thy
nakedness
be
not
discovered
before
it
unquestionably
it
is
not
the
altar
of
the
tabernacle
which
was
made
of
wood
and
plated
over
with
brass
nor
that
of
solomon
temple
which
on
its
eastern
side
had
a
flight
of
steps
the
altar
of
the
second
temple
had
no
steps
but
a
sloping
ascent
to
it
as
also
according
to
the
belief
of
the
jews
had
that
of
the
tabernacle
the
reason
moreover
for
which
in
exodus
steps
are
forbidden
disappears
when
the
priests
are
provided
with
breeches
exodus
and
had
a
passage
right
round
it
at
half
its
height
that
is
here
described
as
the
only
true
one
on
the
other
hand
it
is
obvious
that
a
multiplicity
of
altars
is
not
merely
regarded
as
permissible
but
assumed
as
a
matter
of
course
for
no
stress
at
all
is
laid
upon
having
always
the
same
sacrificial
seat
whether
fixed
or
to
be
moved
about
from
place
to
place
earth
and
unhewn
stones
of
the
field
the
plural
stones
is
perhaps
worthy
of
note
there
were
also
sacrificial
places
consisting
of
one
great
stone
judges
to
the
same
category
also
doubtless
belongs
originally
the
of
araunah
compare
ezra
l
mkwntw
but
inasmuch
as
such
single
sacred
stones
easily
came
into
a
mythological
relation
to
the
deity
offence
was
taken
at
them
as
appears
from
judges
where
the
rock
altar
the
stone
under
the
oak
which
was
conceived
of
as
the
seat
of
the
theophany
upon
which
gideon
offers
and
out
of
which
the
flame
issues
is
corrected
into
an
altar
upon
the
rock
the
macceboth
are
distinguished
from
the
altar
in
exodus
yet
elsewhere
clearly
put
on
the
same
plane
with
it
and
everywhere
more
or
less
identified
with
the
deity
gen
can
be
found
everywhere
and
such
an
altar
falls
to
pieces
just
as
readily
as
it
is
built
a
choice
of
two
kinds
of
material
is
also
given
which
surely
implies
that
the
lawgiver
thought
of
more
than
one
altar
and
not
at
the
place
but
at
every
place
where
he
causes
his
name
to
be
honoured
will
jehovah
come
to
his
worshippers
and
bless
them
thus
the
law
now
under
consideration
is
in
harmony
with
the
custom
and
usage
of
the
first
historical
period
has
its
root
therein
and
gives
sanction
to
it
certainly
the
liberty
to
sacrifice
everywhere
seems
to
be
somewhat
restricted
by
the
added
clause
in
every
place
where
i
cause
my
name
to
be
honoured
but
this
means
nothing
more
than
that
the
spots
where
intercourse
between
earth
and
heaven
took
place
were
not
willingly
regarded
as
arbitrarily
chosen
but
on
the
contrary
were
considered
as
having
been
somehow
or
other
selected
by
the
deity
himself
for
his
service
in
perfect
correspondence
with
the
jehovistic
law
is
the
jehovistic
narrative
of
the
pentateuch
as
in
particular
the
story
of
the
patriarchs
in
j
and
e
very
clearly
shows
at
every
place
where
they
take
up
their
abode
or
make
a
passing
stay
the
fathers
of
the
nation
according
to
this
authority
erect
altars
set
up
memorial
stones
plant
trees
dig
wells
this
does
not
take
place
at
indifferent
and
casual
localities
but
at
shechem
and
bethel
in
ephraim
at
hebron
and
beersheba
in
judah
at
mizpah
mahanaim
and
penuel
in
gilead
nowhere
but
at
famous
and
immemorially
holy
places
of
worship
it
is
on
this
that
the
interest
of
such
notifications
depends
they
are
no
mere
antiquarian
facts
but
full
of
the
most
living
significance
for
the
present
of
the
narrator
the
altar
built
by
abraham
at
shechem
is
the
altar
on
which
sacrifice
still
continues
to
be
made
and
bears
even
unto
this
day
the
name
which
the
patriarch
gave
it
on
the
spot
where
at
hebron
he
first
entertained
jehovah
there
down
to
the
present
day
the
table
has
continued
to
be
spread
even
as
isaac
himself
did
so
do
his
sons
still
swear
amosos
hos
by
the
sacred
well
of
beersheba
which
he
digged
and
sacrifice
there
upon
the
altar
which
he
built
under
the
tamarisk
which
he
planted
the
stone
which
jacob
consecrated
at
bethel
the
generation
of
the
living
continues
to
anoint
paying
the
tithes
which
of
old
he
vowed
to
the
house
of
god
there
this
also
is
the
reason
why
the
sacred
localities
are
so
well
known
to
the
narrator
and
are
punctually
and
accurately
recorded
notwithstanding
the
four
hundred
years
of
the
egyptian
sojourn
which
otherwise
would
have
made
their
identification
a
matter
of
some
little
difficulty
the
altar
which
abraham
built
at
bethel
stands
upon
the
hill
to
the
east
of
the
town
between
bethel
on
the
west
and
ai
on
the
east
others
are
determined
by
means
of
a
tree
or
a
well
as
that
of
shechem
or
beersheba
the
correct
explanation
of
this
is
found
in
ewald
gesch
lsraels

seq

von
abrabam
berlin
drags
in
politics
in
a
repulsive
way
he
does
not
indeed
actually
enter
shechem
and
bethel
these
are
places
hostile
to
judah
but
in
a
genuine
spirit
of
jewish
demonstration
he
builds
altars
in
their
vicinity
and
calls
on
the
name
of
jehovah
rather
he
builds
the
altars
precisely
on
the
places
where
as
can
be
shown
they
afterwards
stood
and
that
was
not
inside
the
towns
in
xviii
also
the
oak
of
mamre
is
employed
to
fix
not
abraham
residence
but
the
place
of
appearing
but
of
course
it
was
not
intended
to
throw
dishonour
upon
the
cultus
of
the
present
when
its
institution
was
ascribed
to
the
fathers
of
the
nation
rather
on
the
contrary
do
these
legends
glorify
the
origin
of
the
sanctuaries
to
which
they
are
attached
and
surround
them
with
the
nimbus
of
a
venerable
consecration
all
the
more
as
the
altars
as
a
rule
are
not
built
by
the
patriarchs
according
to
their
own
private
judgment
wheresoever
they
please
on
the
contrary
a
theophany
calls
attention
to
or
at
least
afterwards
confirms
the
holiness
of
the
place
jehovah
appears
at
shechem
to
abraham
who
thereupon
builds
the
altar
to
jehovah
who
had
appeared
unto
him
he
partakes
of
his
hospitality
under
the
oak
of
mamre
which
is
the
origin
of
the
sacrificial
service
there
he
shows
him
the
place
where
he
is
to
make
an
offering
of
his
son
and
here
the
sanctuary
continues
to
exist
on
the
first
night
of
isaac
sleeping
on
the
sacred
soil
of
beersheba
he
receives
a
visit
from
the
numen
there
residing
and
in
consequence
rears
his
altar
surprised
by
profane
glances
jehovah
acts
as
a
destroyer
but
himself
spontaneously
points
out
to
his
favoured
ones
the
places
where
it
is
his
pleasure
to
allow
himself
to
be
seen
and
where
men
have
seen
him
and
yet
lived
there
a
sanctuary
marks
the
open
way
of
access
to
him
the
substance
of
the
revelation
is
in
these
cases
comparatively
indifferent
i
am
god
what
is
of
importance
is
the
theophany
in
and
for
itself
its
occurrence
on
that
particular
place
it
must
not
be
regarded
as
an
isolated
fact
but
rather
as
the
striking
commencement
of
an
intercourse
r
h
pny
yhwh
between
god
and
man
which
is
destined
to
be
continued
at
this
spot
and
also
as
the
first
and
strongest
expression
of
the
sanctity
of
the
soil
this
way
of
looking
at
the
thing
appears
most
clearly
and
with
incomparable
charm
in
the
story
of
the
ladder
which
jacob
saw
at
bethel
he
dreamed
and
behold
a
ladder
set
up
on
the
earth
and
the
top
of
it
reached
to
heaven
and
behold
the
angels
of
god
ascending
and
descending
on
it
and
he
was
afraid
and
said
how
dreadful
is
this
place
this
is
none
other
but
the
house
of
god
and
this
is
the
gate
of
heaven
the
ladder
stands
at
the
place
not
at
this
moment
merely
but
continually
and
as
it
were
by
nature
bethel
so
jacob
perceives
from
this
is
a
place
where
heaven
and
earth
meet
where
the
angels
ascend
and
descend
to
carry
on
the
communication
between
earth
and
heaven
ordained
by
god
at
this
gate
all
this
is
only
to
be
understood
as
a
glorification
of
the
relations
and
arrangements
of
the
cultus
as
we
find
them
say
in
the
first
centuries
of
the
divided
kingdom
all
that
seems
offensive
and
heathenish
to
a
later
age
is
here
consecrated
and
countenanced
by
jehovah
himself
and
his
favoured
ones
the
high
places
the
memorial
stones
maccceboth
the
trees
the
wells
but
it
is
only
the
public
cultus
and
that
of
certain
leading
sanctuaries
that
is
thus
glorified
on
the
other
hand
the
domestic
worship
of
seraphim
to
which
the
women
are
specially
attached
is
already
discountenanced
in
e
by
jacob
asherim
are
not
alluded
to
molten
images
are
rejected
particularly
by
here
perhaps
a
correction
of
the
ancient
legend
has
already
taken
place
in
je
an
essential
agreement
prevails
between
the
jehovistic
law
which
sanctions
the
existing
seats
of
worship
and
the
jehovistic
narrative
the
latter
is
as
regards
its
nucleus
perhaps
somewhat
older
both
obviously
belong
to
the
period
a
later
revision
of
the
narrative
in
the
prophetic
sense
has
not
altered
the
essential
character
of
its
fundamental
elements
it
is
inconceivable
that
amos
or
hosea
or
any
person
could
go
with
such
sympathising
love
and
believing
reverence
into
narratives
which
only
served
to
invest
with
a
still
brighter
nimbus
and
higher
respect
the
existing
religious
worship
carried
on
by
the
people
on
the
high
places
of
isaac
as
their
holiest
occupation
the
jehovistic
book
of
the
covenant
lies
indeed
at
the
foundation
of
deuteronomy
but
in
one
point
they
differ
materially
and
that
precisely
the
one
which
concerns
us
here
as
there
so
here
also
the
legislation
properly
so
called
begins
deut
xii
with
an
ordinance
relating
to
the
service
of
the
altar
but
now
we
have
moses
addressing
the
israeites
in
the
following
terms
when
ye
come
into
the
land
of
canaan
ye
shall
utterly
destroy
all
the
places
of
worship
which
ye
find
there
and
ye
shall
not
worship
jehovah
your
god
after
the
manner
in
which
the
heathen
serve
theirs
nay
but
only
unto
the
place
which
the
lord
your
god
shall
choose
out
of
all
your
tribes
for
his
habitation
shall
ye
seek
and
thither
shall
ye
bring
your
offerings
and
gifts
and
there
shall
ye
eat
before
him
and
rejoice
here
at
this
day
we
do
every
man
whatsoever
is
right
in
his
own
eyes
but
when
ye
have
found
fixed
abodes
and
rest
from
your
enemies
round
about
then
shall
the
place
which
jehovah
shall
choose
for
his
habitation
in
one
of
your
tribes
be
the
one
place
to
which
ye
shall
bring
your
offerings
and
gifts
take
heed
that
ye
offer
not
in
every
place
that
ye
see
ye
may
not
eat
your
holy
gifts
in
every
town
but
only
in
the
place
which
jehovah
shall
choose
the
law
is
never
weary
of
again
and
again
repeating
its
injunction
of
local
unity
of
worship
in
doing
so
it
is
in
conscious
opposition
to
the
things
that
we
do
here
this
day
and
throughout
has
a
polemical
and
reforming
attitude
towards
existing
usage
it
is
rightly
therefore
assigned
by
historical
criticism
to
the
period
of
the
attacks
made
on
the
bamoth
by
the
reforming
party
at
jerusalem
as
the
book
of
the
covenant
and
the
whole
jehovistic
writing
in
genera
reflects
the
first
period
in
the
history
of
the
cultus
so
deuteronomy
is
the
legal
expression
of
the
second
period
of
struggle
and
transition
the
historical
order
is
all
the
more
certain
because
the
literary
dependence
of
deuteronomy
on
the
jehovistic
laws
and
narratives
can
be
demonstrated
independently
and
is
an
admitted
fact
from
this
the
step
is
easy
to
the
belief
that
the
work
whose
discovery
gave
occasion
to
king
josiah
to
destroy
the
local
sanctuaries
was
this
very
book
of
deuteronomy
which
originally
must
have
had
an
independent
existence
and
a
shorter
form
than
at
present
this
alone
at
least
of
all
the
books
of
the
pentateuch
gives
so
imperious
an
expression
to
the
restriction
of
the
sacrificial
worship
to
the
one
chosen
place
here
only
does
the
demand
make
itself
so
felt
in
its
aggressive
novelty
and
dominate
the
whole
tendency
of
the
the
old
material
which
he
makes
use
of
is
invariably
shaped
with
a
view
to
this
and
on
all
hands
he
follows
the
rule
out
to
its
logical
consequences
to
make
its
fulfilment
possible
he
changes
former
arrangements
permitting
what
had
been
forbidden
and
prohibiting
what
had
been
allowed
in
almost
every
case
this
motive
lies
at
the
foundation
of
all
his
other
innovations
this
is
seen
for
example
when
he
permits
slaying
without
sacrificing
and
that
too
anywhere
when
in
order
not
to
abolish
the
right
of
asylum
exodus
ii
along
with
the
altars
he
appoints
special
cities
of
refuge
for
the
innocent
who
are
pursued
by
the
avenger
of
blood
when
he
provides
for
the
priests
of
the
suppressed
sanctuaries
recommending
the
provincials
to
take
them
along
with
them
on
their
sacrificial
pilgrimages
and
giving
them
the
right
to
officiate
in
the
temple
at
jerusalem
just
like
the
hereditarily
permanent
clergy
there
in
other
respects
also
the
dominance
of
the
same
point
of
view
is
seen
for
example
it
is
chiefly
from
regard
to
it
that
the
old
ordinances
and
customs
relating
to
the
religious
dues
and
the
festivals
are
set
forth
in
the
form
which
they
must
henceforth
assume
a
law
so
living
which
stands
at
every
point
in
immediate
contact
with
reality
which
is
at
war
with
traditionary
custom
and
which
proceeds
with
constant
reference
to
the
demands
of
practical
life
is
no
mere
velleity
no
mere
cobweb
of
an
idle
brain
but
has
as
certainly
arisen
out
of
historical
occasions
as
it
is
designed
to
operate
powerfully
on
the
course
of
the
subsequent
history
a
judgment
pronounced
in
accordance
with
the
facts
can
therefore
assign
to
it
an
historical
place
only
within
that
movement
of
reformation
which
was
brought
to
a
victorious
issue
by
king
josiah
it
is
often
supposed
that
the
priestly
code
is
somewhat
indifferent
to
the
question
of
the
one
sanctuary
neither
permitting
multiplicity
of
sacrificial
centres
nor
laying
stress
upon
the
unity
and
that
on
account
of
this
attitude
it
must
be
assigned
to
an
earlier
date
than
deuteronomy
de

the

opusc
theol
such
an
idea
is
to
say
the
least
in
the
highest
degree
superficial
the
assumption
that
worship
is
restricted
to
one
single
centre
runs
everywhere
throughout
the
entire
document
to
appeal
specially
in
proof
of
the
restriction
to
leviticus
xvii
or
josh
is
to
indicate
a
complete
failure
to
apprehend
the
whole
tenor
of
exodus
ix
before
so
much
as
a
single
regulation
having
reference
to
the
matter
of
worship
can
be
given
such
is
the
meaning
of
the
large
section
referred
to
the
one
rightful
place
wherein
to
engage
in
it
must
be
specified
the
tabernacle
is
not
narrative
merely
but
like
all
the
narratives
in
that
book
law
as
well
it
expresses
the
legal
unity
of
the
worship
as
an
historical
fact
which
from
the
very
beginning
ever
since
the
exodus
has
held
good
in
israel
one
god
one
sanctuary
that
is
the
idea
with
the
ordinances
of
the
tabernacle
which
form
the
sum
of
the
divine
revelation
on
sinai
the
theocracy
was
founded
where
the
one
is
there
is
the
other
the
description
of
it
therefore
stands
at
the
head
of
the
priestly
code
just
as
that
of
the
temple
stands
at
the
head
of
the
legislation
in
ezekiel
it
is
the
basis
and
indispensable
foundation
without
which
all
else
would
merely
float
in
the
air
first
must
the
seat
of
the
divine
presence
on
earth
be
given
before
the
sacred
community
can
come
into
life
and
the
cultus
into
force
is
it
supposes
that
the
tabernacle
tolerates
other
sanctuaries
besides
itself
why
then
the
encampment
of
the
twelve
tribes
around
it
which
has
no
military
but
a
purely
religious
significance
and
derives
its
whole
meaning
from
its
sacred
centre
whence
this
concentration
of
all
israel
into
one
great
congregation
qhl
dh
without
its
like
anywhere
else
in
the
old
testament
on
the
contrary
there
is
no
other
place
besides
this
at
which
god
dwells
and
suffers
himself
to
be
seen
no
place
but
this
alone
where
man
can
draw
near
to
him
and
seek
his
face
with
offerings
and
gifts
this
view
is
the
axiom
that
underlies
the
whole
ritual
legislation
of
the
middle
part
of
the
pentateuch
it
is
indicated
with
special
clearness
by
the
lpny
hl
mw
d
before
the
tabernacle
introduced
at
every
turn
in
the
ordinances
for
sacrifice
what
then
are
we
to
infer
from
this
as
to
the
historical
place
of
the
priestly
code
if
it
be
judged
necessary
to
assign
it
such
a
place
at
all
by
all
the
laws
of
logic
it
can
no
more
belong
to
the
first
period
than
deuteronomy
does
but
is
it
older
or
younger
than
deuteronomy
in
that
book
the
unity
of
the
cultus
is
commanded
in
the
priestly
code
it
is
presupposed
everywhere
it
is
tacitly
assumed
as
a
fundamental
postulate
but
nowhere
does
it
find
actual
expression
it
is
nothing
new
but
quite
a
thing
except
in
leviticus
xvii
but
the
small
body
of
legislation
contained
in
leviticus
is
the
transition
from
deuteronomy
to
the
priestly
code
of
course
what
follows
from
this
for
the
question
before
us
to
my
thinking
this
that
the
priestly
code
rests
upon
the
result
which
is
only
the
aim
of
deuteronomy
the
latter
is
in
the
midst
of
movement
and
conflict
it
clearly
speaks
out
its
reforming
intention
its
opposition
to
the
traditional
what
we
do
here
this
day
the
former
stands
outside
of
and
above
the
struggle
the
end
has
been
reached
and
made
a
secure
possession
on
the
basis
of
the
priestly
code
no
reformation
would
ever
have
taken
place
no
josiah
would
ever
have
observed
from
it
that
the
actual
condition
of
affairs
was
perverse
and
required
to
be
set
right
it
proceeds
as
if
everything
had
been
for
long
in
the
best
of
order
it
is
only
in
deuteronomy
moreover
that
one
sees
to
the
root
of
the
matter
and
recognises
its
connection
with
the
anxiety
for
a
strict
monotheism
and
for
the
elimination
from
the
worship
of
the
popular
heathenish
elements
and
thus
with
a
deep
and
really
worthy
aim
in
the
priestly
code
the
reason
of
the
appointments
in
themselves
by
no
means
rational
rests
upon
their
own
legitimacy
just
as
everything
that
is
actual
ordinarily
seems
natural
and
in
no
need
of
explanation
nowhere
does
it
become
apparent
that
the
abolition
of
the
bamoth
and
asherim
and
memorial
stones
is
the
real
object
contemplated
these
institutions
are
now
almost
unknown
and
what
is
really
only
intelligible
as
a
negative
and
polemical
ordinance
is
regarded
as
full
of
meaning
in
itself
the
idea
as
idea
is
older
than
the
idea
as
history
in
deuteronomy
it
appears
in
its
native
colours
comes
forward
with
its
aggressive
challenge
to
do
battle
with
the
actual
one
step
indeed
is
taken
towards
investing
it
with
an
historical
character
in
so
far
as
it
is
put
into
the
mouth
of
moses
but
the
beginning
thus
made
keeps
within
modest
limits
moses
only
lays
down
the
law
for
its
execution
he
makes
no
provision
as
regards
his
own
time
nor
does
he
demand
it
for
the
immediate
future
rather
it
is
represented
as
not
destined
to
come
into
force
until
the
people
shall
have
concluded
the
conquest
of
the
country
and
secured
a
settled
peace
we
have
already
found
reason
to
surmise
that
the
reference
to
menuha
is
intended
to
defer
the
date
when
the
law
shall
come
into
force
to
the
days
of
david
and
solomon
this
is
all
the
more
probable
inasmuch
as
there
is
required
for
its
fulfilment
the
place
which
jehovah
shall
choose
by
which
only
the
capital
of
judah
can
be
meant
deuteronomy
therefore
knows
nothing
of
the
principle
that
what
ought
to
be
must
actually
have
been
from
the
beginning
until
the
building
of
solomon
temple
the
unity
of
worship
according
to
it
had
properly
speaking
never
had
any
existence
and
moreover
it
is
easy
to
read
between
the
lines
that
even
after
that
date
it
was
more
a
pious
wish
than
a
practical
demand
the
priestly
code
on
the
other
hand
is
unable
to
think
of
religion
without
the
one
sanctuary
and
can
not
for
a
moment
imagine
israel
without
it
carrying
its
actual
existence
back
to
the
very
beginning
of
the
theocracy
and
in
accordance
with
this
completely
altering
the
ancient
history
the
temple
the
focus
to
which
the
worship
was
concentrated
and
which
in
reality
was
not
built
until
time
is
by
this
document
regarded
as
so
indispensable
even
for
the
troubled
days
of
the
wanderings
before
the
settlement
that
it
is
made
portable
and
in
the
form
of
a
tabernacle
set
up
in
the
very
beginning
of
things
for
the
truth
is
that
the
tabernacle
is
the
copy
not
the
prototype
of
the
temple
at
jerusalem
the
resemblance
of
the
two
is
indeed
unmistakable
in
wisdom
of
solomon
ix
the
temple
is
called
mimhma
skhnhs
hagias
josephus
antiquities
iii
says
of
the
tabernacle
h
metaferomenou
naou
diefere
but
it
is
not
said
in
vi
that
solomon
made
use
of
the
old
pattern
and
ordered
his
tyrian
workmen
to
follow
it
the
posteriority
of
the
mosaic
structure
comes
into
clearer
light
from
the
two
following
considerations
brought
forward
by
graf
in
the
first
place
in
the
description
of
the
tabernacle
mention
is
repeatedly
made
of
its
south
north
and
west
side
without
any
preceding
rubric
as
to
a
definite
and
constantly
uniform
orientation
the
latter
is
tacitly
taken
for
granted
being
borrowed
from
that
of
the
temple
which
was
a
fixed
building
and
did
not
change
its
site
in
the
second
place
the
brazen
altar
is
strictly
speaking
described
as
an
altar
of
wood
merely
plated
with
brass
for
a
fireplace
of
very
large
size
upon
which
a
strong
fire
continually
burns
a
perfectly
absurd
construction
which
is
only
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
wish
to
make
the
brazen
altar
which
solomon
cast
xvi
transportable
by
changing
its
interior
into
wood
the
main
point
however
is
this
that
the
tabernacle
of
the
priestly
code
in
its
essential
meaning
is
not
a
mere
provisional
shelter
for
the
ark
on
the
march
but
the
sole
legitimate
sanctuary
for
the
community
of
the
twelve
tribes
prior
to
the
days
of
solomon
and
so
in
fact
a
projection
of
the
later
temple
how
modest
one
might
almost
say
how
awkwardly
bashful
is
the
deuteronomic
reference
to
the
future
place
which
jehovah
is
to
choose
when
compared
with
this
calm
assumption
that
the
necessary
centre
of
unity
of
worship
was
given
from
the
first
in
the
one
case
we
have
so
to
speak
only
the
idea
as
it
exists
in
the
mind
of
the
lawgiver
but
making
no
claim
to
be
realised
till
a
much
later
date
in
the
other
the
mosaic
idea
has
acquired
also
a
mosaic
embodiment
with
which
it
entered
the
world
at
the
very
first
by
the
same
simple
historical
method
which
carries
the
central
sanctuary
back
into
the
period
before
solomon
does
the
priestly
author
abolish
the
other
places
of
worship
his
levitical
cities
are
for
the
most
part
demonstrably
a
metamorphosis
of
the
old
bamoth
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
the
time
the
altar
which
the
tribes
eastward
of
jordan
build
josh
xxii
is
erected
with
no
intention
that
it
should
be
used
but
merely
in
commemoration
of
something
even
the
period
is
rendered
orthodox
in
the
same
fashion
the
patriarchs
having
no
tabernacle
have
no
worship
at
all
according
to
the
priestly
code
they
build
no
altars
bring
no
offerings
and
scrupulously
abstain
from
everything
by
which
they
might
in
any
way
encroach
on
the
privilege
of
the
one
true
sanctuary
this
manner
of
shaping
the
patriarchal
history
is
only
the
extreme
consequence
of
the
effort
to
carry
out
with
uniformity
in
history
the
semper
ubique
et
ab
omnibus
of
the
legal
unity
of
worship
thus
in
deuteronomy
the
institution
is
only
in
its
and
has
still
to
struggle
for
the
victory
against
the
praxis
of
the
present
but
in
the
priestly
code
claims
immemorial
legitimacy
and
strives
to
bring
the
past
into
conformity
with
itself
obviously
because
it
already
dominates
the
present
the
carrying
back
of
the
new
into
the
olden
time
always
takes
place
at
a
later
date
than
the
ushering
into
existence
of
the
new
itself
deuteronomy
has
its
position
in
the
very
midst
of
the
historical
crisis
and
still
stands
in
a
close
relation
with
the
older
period
of
worship
the
conditions
of
which
it
can
contest
but
is
unable
to
ignore
and
still
less
to
deny
but
on
the
other
hand
the
priestly
code
is
hindered
by
no
survival
to
present
times
of
the
older
usage
from
projecting
an
image
of
antiquity
such
as
it
must
have
been
unhampered
by
visible
relics
or
living
tradition
of
an
older
state
it
can
idealise
the
past
to
its
heart
content
its
place
then
is
after
deuteronomy
and
in
the
third
period
of
the
history
of
the
cultus
in
which
on
the
one
hand
the
unity
of
the
sanctuary
was
an
established
fact
contested
by
no
one
and
impugned
by
nothing
and
in
which
on
the
other
hand
the
natural
connection
between
the
present
and
the
past
had
been
so
severed
by
the
exile
that
there
was
no
obstacle
to
prevent
an
artificial
and
ideal
repristination
of
the
latter
the
reverse
of
this
is
what
is
usually
held
in
deuteronomy
it
is
considered
there
occur
clear
references
to
the
period
of
the
kings
but
the
priestly
code
with
its
historical
presuppositions
does
not
fit
in
with
any
situation
belonging
to
that
time
and
is
therefore
older
when
the
cultus
rests
upon
the
temple
of
solomon
as
its
foundation
as
in
ezekiel
then
every
one
recognises
the
later
date
but
when
it
is
based
upon
the
tabernacle
the
case
is
regarded
as
quite
different
the
great
antiquity
of
the
priestly
legislation
is
proved
by
relegating
it
to
an
historical
sphere
created
by
itself
out
of
its
own
legal
premisses
but
which
is
nowhere
to
be
found
within
and
therefore
must
have
preceded
actual
history
thus
so
to
speak
it
holds
itself
up
in
the
air
by
its
own
waistband
it
may
however
seem
as
if
hitherto
it
had
only
been
asserted
that
the
tabernacle
rests
on
an
historical
fiction
in
truth
it
is
proved
but
yet
it
may
be
well
to
add
some
things
which
have
indeed
been
said
long
before
now
but
never
as
yet
properly
laid
to
heart
the
subject
of
discussion
be
it
premised
is
the
tabernacle
of
the
priestly
code
for
some
kind
of
tent
for
the
ark
there
may
well
have
been
in
fact
tents
were
in
palestine
the
earliest
dwellings
of
idols
hos
and
only
afterwards
gave
place
to
fixed
houses
and
even
the
jehovistic
tradition
although
not
j
knows
of
a
sacred
tent
it
is
never
however
employed
for
legislative
purposes
but
is
simply
a
shelter
for
the
ark
it
stands
without
the
camp
as
the
oldest
sanctuaries
were
wont
to
do
outside
the
cities
it
is
kept
by
joshua
as
aedituus
who
sleeps
in
it
as
did
samuel
the
aedituus
for
eli
in
connection
with
the
mosaic
camp
and
outside
it
just
as
the
older
high
places
generally
had
open
sites
without
the
city
the
question
before
us
has
reference
exclusively
to
the
particular
tent
which
according
to
exodus
xxv
was
erected
at
the
command
of
god
as
the
basis
of
the
theocracy
the
central
sanctuary
which
also
in
outward
details
was
the
prototype
of
the
temple
at
the
outset
its
very
possibility
is
doubtful
very
strange
is
the
contrast
between
this
splendid
structure
on
which
the
costliest
material
is
lavished
and
wrought
in
the
most
advanced
style
of
oriental
art
and
the
soil
on
which
it
rises
in
the
wilderness
amongst
the
native
hebrew
nomad
tribes
who
are
represented
as
having
got
it
ready
offhand
and
without
external
help
the
incompatibility
has
long
been
noticed
and
gave
rise
to
doubts
as
early
as
the
time
of
voltaire
these
may
however
be
left
to
themselves
suffice
it
that
hebrew
tradition
even
from
the
time
of
the
judges
and
the
first
kings
for
which
the
mosaic
tabernacle
was
strictly
speaking
intended
knows
nothing
at
all
about
it
it
appears
a
bold
thing
to
say
so
when
one
sees
how
much
many
a
modern
author
who
knows
how
to
make
a
skilful
use
of
the
book
of
chronicles
has
to
tell
about
the
tabernacle
for
in
chron
seq
we
are
told
that
solomon
celebrated
his
accession
to
the
throne
with
a
great
sacrificial
feast
at
gibeon
because
the
tabernacle
and
the
brazen
altar
of
moses
were
there
in
like
manner
in
it
is
said
that
david
offered
sacrifice
indeed
on
the
of
araunah
but
that
and
the
legitimate
altar
were
at
that
time
at
gibeon
and
further
xvi
that
zadok
the
legitimate
high
priest
officiated
there
from
these
data
the
rabbins
first
and
in
recent
times
keil
and
movers
especially
have
constructed
a
systematic
history
of
the
tabernacle
down
to
the
building
of
the
temple
under
david
and
solomon
as
long
as
the
ark
was
on
mount
zion
the
tabernacle
was
at
gibeon
as
is
also
shown
by
the
fact
that
offerings
were
sacrificed
to
jehovah
there
before
that
it
was
at
nob
where
ephod
and
shewbread
xxi
are
mentioned
and
still
earlier
from
joshua
time
onward
it
was
at
shiloh
but
these
were
only
its
permanent
sites
apart
from
which
it
was
temporarily
set
up
now
here
now
there
saving
by
its
rapidity
of
movement
one
might
almost
say
ubiquity
the
unity
of
the
cultus
notwithstanding
the
variety
and
great
distances
of
the
places
at
which
that
cultus
was
celebrated
in
every
case
in
which
a
manifestation
of
jehovah
and
an
offering
to
him
are
spoken
of
the
tabernacle
must
be
tacitly
understood

need
not
in

be
insisted
on
what
is
of
greatest
importance
is
that
the
point
from
which
it
starts
is
in
the
last
degree
insecure
for
the
statement
of
chronicles
that
solomon
offered
the
offering
of
his
accession
upon
the
altar
of
the
tabernacle
at
gibeon
is
in
contradiction
with
that
of
the
older
parallel
narrative
of
the
latter
not
only
is
silent
about
the
mosaic
tabernacle
which
is
alleged
to
have
stood
at
gibeon
but
expressly
says
that
solomon
offered
upon
a
high
place
as
such
and
excuses
him
for
this
on
the
plea
that
at
that
time
no
house
to
the
name
of
jehovah
had
as
yet
been
built
that
the
chronicler
draws
from
this
narrative
is
certain
on
general
grounds
and
is
shown
particularly
by
this
that
he
designates
the
tabernacle
at
gibeon
by
the
name
of
bamah
a
contradictio
in
adjecto
which
is
only
to
be
explained
by
the
desire
to
give
an
authentic
interpretation
of
the
great
bamah
at
gibeon
in
iii
here
as
elsewhere
he
brings
the
history
into
agreement
with
the
law
the
young
and
pious
solomon
can
have
offered
his
sacrifice
only
at
the
legal
place
which
therefore
must
be
that
high
place
at
gibeon
along
with
chron
seq
also
fall
the
two
other
statements
both
of
which
are
dependent
on
that
leading
passage
as
is
clear
revealed
by
the
recurring
phrase
the
bamah
of
gibeon
the
tabernacle
does
not
elsewhere
occur
in
chronicles
it
has
not
yet
brought
its
consequences
with
it
and
not
yet
permeated
the
historical
view
of
the
author
he
would
certainly
have
experienced
some
embarrassment
at
the
question
whether
it
had
previously
stood
at
nob
for
he
lays
stress
upon
the
connection
between
the
legitimate
sanctuary
and
the
legitimate
priestly
family
which
it
is
indeed
possible
to
assume
for
shiloh
but
not
for
nob
of
the
priests
at
nob
abiathar
alone
escaped
the
massacre
xxii
gad
therefore
was
not
one
of
them
the
fact
that
chronicles
represents
the
israelite
history
in
accordance
with
the
priestly
code
has
had
the
effect
of
causing
its
view
of
the
history
to
be
involuntarily
taken
as
fundamental
but
ought
much
rather
to
have
caused
it
to
be
left
altogether
out
of
account
where
the
object
to
ascertain
what
was
the
real
and
genuine
tradition
the
books
of
judges
and
samuel
make
mention
indeed
of
many
sanctuaries
but
never
among
them
of
the
tabernacle
the
most
important
of
all
for
the
single
passage
where
the
name
ohel
moed
occurs
is
badly
attested
and
from
its
contents
open
to
suspicion
the
passage
does
not
occur
in
the
lxx
and
everywhere
else
in
the
sanctuary
of
shiloh
is
called
hekal
that
is
to
say
certainly
not
a
tent
of
the
existence
of
the
ark
of
jehovah
there
certainly
are
distinct
traces
towards
the
end
of
the
period
of
the
judges
compare
but
is
the
ark
a
guarantee
of
the
existence
of
the
tabernacle
on
the
contrary
its
whole
history
down
to
the
period
of
its
being
deposited
in
the
temple
of
solomon
is
a
proof
that
it
was
regarded
as
quite
independent
of
any
tent
specially
consecrated
for
its
reception
but
this
abolishes
the
notion
of
the
mosaic
tabernacle
for
according
to
the
law
the
two
things
belong
necessarily
to
each
other
the
one
can
not
exist
without
the
other
both
are
of
equally
great
importance
the
tabernacle
must
everywhere
accompany
the
symbol
of
its
presence
the
darkness
of
the
holy
of
holies
is
at
the
same
time
the
of
the
ark
only
under
compulsion
of
necessity
and
even
then
not
except
under
the
covering
of
the
curtains
does
it
leave
its
lodging
during
a
march
only
to
return
to
it
again
as
soon
as
the
new
is
reached
but
according
to
iv
on
the
other
hand
it
is
only
the
ark
that
goes
to
the
campaign
it
alone
falls
into
the
hands
of
the
philistines
even
in
chap
where
the
symbol
of
jehovah
is
placed
in
the
temple
of
dagon
at
ashdod
not
a
word
is
said
of
the
tabernacle
or
of
the
altar
which
is
necessarily
connected
with
it
and
chap
vi
is
equally
silent
although
here
the
enemy
plainly
gives
back
the
whole
of
his
sacred
spoil
it
is
assumed
that
the
housing
of
the
ark
was
left
behind
at
shiloh
very
likely
but
that
was
not
the
mosaic
tabernacle
the
inseparable
companion
of
the
ark
in
fact
the
narrator
speaks
of
a
permanent
house
at
shiloh
with
doors
and
doorposts
that
possibly
may
be
an
anachronism
yet
why
compare
similar
passages
in
josh
where
the
very
anachronism
shows
that
the
idea
of
the
tabernacle
was
unknown
to
the
narrator
that
moreover
a
permanent
house
did
actually
exist
then
at
shiloh
follows
from
the
circumstance
that
jeremiah
vii
speaks
of
its
ruins
for
he
could
not
regard
any
other
than
a
sanctuary
as
preceding
that
of
jerusalem
and
besides
there
is
not
the
faintest
trace
of
a
more
important
temple
having
arisen
at
shiloh
within
the
period
of
the
kings
but
so
much
at
least
may
be
inferred
from
it
that
he
had
not
any
idea
of
the
tabernacle
which
however
would
have
had
to
go
with
the
ark
to
the
field
if
on
this
one
occasion
only
an
illegal
exception
to
the
law
was
made
why
in
that
case
was
not
the
ark
at
least
after
its
surrender
again
restored
to
the
lodging
from
which
strictly
speaking
it
ought
never
to
have
been
separated
at
all
instead
of
this
it
is
brought
to
bethshemesh
where
it
causes
disaster
because
the
people
show
curiosity
about
it
thence
it
comes
to
kirjathjearim
where
it
stays
for
many
years
in
the
house
of
a
private
person
from
here
david
causes
it
to
be
brought
to
jerusalem
one
naturally
supposes
if
one
thinks
in
the
lines
of
the
view
given
in
the
pentateuch
and
in
chronicles
in
order
that
it
may
be
at
last
restored
to
the
tabernacle
to
be
simultaneously
brought
to
jerusalem
but
no
thought
of
this
however
obvious
it
may
seem
occurs
to
the
king
in
the
first
instance
his
intention
is
to
have
the
ark
beside
himself
in
the
citadel
but
he
is
terrified
out
of
this
and
at
a
loss
where
else
to
put
it
he
at
last
places
it
in
the
house
of
one
of
his
principal
people
of
gath
had
he
known
anything
about
the
tabernacle
had
he
had
any
suspicion
that
it
was
standing
empty
at
gibeon
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
he
would
have
been
relieved
of
all
difficulty
but
inasmuch
as
the
ark
brings
blessing
to
the
house
of
the
ark
be
it
remembered
in
the
house
of
a
soldier
and
a
philistine
yet
bringing
down
not
wrath
but
blessing
the
chronicle
has
good
reason
for
making
him
a
levite
but
gath
without
any
qualifying
epithet
and
particularly
in
connection
with
david
is
the
philistine
gath
and
belongs
to
the
bodyquard
which
consisted
chiefly
of
foreigners
and
philistines
his
name
moreover
is
hardly
israelite
the
king
is
thereby
encouraged
to
persevere
after
all
with
his
original
proposal
and
establish
it
upon
his
citadel
and
this
he
does
in
a
tent
he
had
caused
to
be
made
for
it
which
tent
of
david
in
zion
continued
to
be
its
lodging
until
the
temple
was
built
some
mention
of
the
tabernacle
had
it
existed
would
have
been
inevitable
when
the
temple
took
its
place
that
it
did
not
serve
as
the
model
of
the
temple
has
already
been
said
but
it
might
have
been
expected
at
least
that
in
the
account
of
the
building
of
the
new
sanctuary
some
word
might
have
escaped
about
the
whereabouts
of
the
old
and
this
expectation
seems
to
be
realised
in
which
says
that
when
the
temple
was
finished
there
were
brought
into
it
besides
the
ark
the
ohel
moed
and
all
the
sacred
vessels
that
were
therein
interpreters
hesitate
as
to
whether
they
ought
to
understand
by
the
ohel
moed
the
tent
of
the
ark
upon
zion
to
which
alone
reference
has
been
made
in
the
preceding
narrative
or
whether
it
is
the
mosaic
tent
which
according
to
chronicles
was
standing
at
gibeon
but
of
which
the
book
of
kings
tells
nothing
and
also
knows
nothing
it
is
probable
that
the
author
of
mixed
up
both
together
but
we
have
to
face
the
following
alternative
either
the
statement
belongs
to
the
original
context
of
the
narrative
in
which
it
occurs
and
in
that
case
the
ohel
moed
can
only
be
the
tent
on
mount
zion
or
the
ohel
moed
of
is
the
mosaic
tabernacle
which
was
removed
from
gibeon
into
solomon
temple
and
in
that
case
the
allegation
has
no
connection
with
its
context
and
does
not
hang
together
with
the
premisses
which
that
furnishes
in
other
words
it
is
the
interpolation
of
a
later
hand
the
former
alternative
though
possible
is
improbable
for
the
name
ohel
moed
occurs
absolutely
nowhere
in
the
books
of
judges
samuel
and
kings
apart
from
the
interpolation
in
and
particularly
it
is
not
used
to
denote
david
tent
upon
mount
zion
and
moreover
that
tent
had
received
too
little
of
the
consecration
of
antiquity
and
according
to
vii
was
too
insignificant
and
provisional
to
be
thought
worthy
of
preservation
in
the
temple
but
if
the
ohel
moed
is
here
what
it
everywhere
else
is
the
tabernacle
as
is
indicated
also
by
the
sacred
vessels
then
the
verse
is
as
has
been
said
an
interpolation
the
motive
for
such
a
thing
is
easily
understood
the
same
difficulty
as
that
with
which
we
set
out
must
have
made
it
natural
for
any
jew
who
started
from
the
ideas
of
the
pentateuch
to
look
for
the
tabernacle
here
and
if
he
did
not
find
it
to
introduce
it
yet
even
the
interpolation
does
not
remove
the
difficulties
where
is
the
mosaic
altar
of
it
was
quite
as
important
and
holy
as
the
tabernacle
itself
even
in
chronicles
it
is
invariably
mentioned
expressly
in
connection
with
it
and
did
not
deserve
to
be
permitted
to
go
to
ruin
at
gibeon
which
from
another
point
of
view
would
also
have
been
extremely
dangerous
to
the
unity
of
the
sacrificial
worship
further
if
the
sacred
vessels
were
transferred
from
the
tabernacle
to
the
temple
why
then
was
it
that
solomon
according
to
cast
a
completely
new
set
the
brazen
altar
cast
by
solomon
is
not
now
found
in
the
inventory
of
the
temple
furniture
in
vii
but
originally
it
can
not
have
been
absent
for
it
is
the
most
important
article
it
has
therefore
been
struck
out
in
order
to
avoid
collision
with
the
brazen
altar
of
moses
the
deletion
is
the
negative
counterpart
to
the
interpolation
of
the
tabernacle
in
the
old
ones
were
costly
enough
in
part
even
costlier
than
the
new
and
moreover
had
been
consecrated
by
long
use
it
is
clear
that
in
solomon
time
neither
tabernacle
nor
holy
vessels
nor
brazen
altar
of
moses
had
any
existence
but
if
there
was
no
tabernacle
in
the
time
of
the
last
judges
and
first
kings
as
little
was
it
in
existence
during
the
whole
of
the
previous
period
this
is
seen
from
a
section
with
whose
historicity
we
have
here
nothing
to
do
but
which
at
all
events
reflects
the
view
of
a
author
it
is
there
told
that
david
after
he
had
obtained
rest
from
all
his
enemies
contemplated
building
a
worthy
home
for
the
ark
and
expressed
his
determination
to
the
prophet
nathan
in
the
words
i
dwell
in
a
house
of
cedar
and
the
ark
of
god
within
curtains
according
to
he
can
only
mean
the
tent
which
he
had
set
up
that
is
to
say
not
the
mosaic
tabernacle
which
moreover
according
to
the
description
of
exodus
xxv
could
not
appropriately
be
contrasted
with
a
timber
erection
still
less
be
regarded
as
a
mean
structure
or
unworthy
of
the
deity
for
in
point
of
magnificence
it
at
least
competed
with
the
temple
of
solomon
nathan
at
first
approves
of
the
king
intention
but
afterwards
discountenances
it
saying
that
at
present
god
does
not
wish
to
have
anything
different
from
that
which
he
has
hitherto
had
i
have
dwelt
in
no
house
since
the
day
that
i
brought
the
children
of
israel
out
of
egypt
but
have
wandered
about
under
tent
and
covering
nathan
also
of
course
has
not
in
his
eye
the
mosaic
tabernacle
as
the
present
lodging
of
the
ark
but
david
tent
upon
zion
now
he
does
not
say
that
the
ark
has
formerly
been
always
in
the
tabernacle
and
that
its
present
harbourage
is
therefore
in
the
highest
degree
unlawful
but
on
the
contrary
that
the
present
state
of
matters
is
the
right
one
that
until
now
the
ark
has
invariably
been
housed
under
an
equally
simple
and
unpretentious
roof
as
david
tent
does
not
date
back
to
the
exodus
nathan
is
necessarily
speaking
of
changing
tents
and
dwellings
the
reading
of
the
parallel
passage
in
therefore
correctly
interprets
the
sense
there
could
be
no
more
fundamental
contradiction
to
the
representation
contained
in
the
pentateuch
than
that
embodied
in
these
words
the
ark
has
not
as
its
correlate
a
single
definite
sacred
tent
of
state
but
is
quite
indifferent
to
the
shelter
it
enjoys
has
frequently
changed
its
abode
but
never
had
any
particularly
fine
one
such
has
been
the
state
of
matters
since
the
time
of
moses
such
is
the
position
of
affairs
as
regards
the
tabernacle
if
it
is
determined
that
the
age
of
the
priestly
code
is
to
hang
by
these
threads
i
have
no
objection
the
representation
of
the
tabernacle
arose
out
of
the
temple
of
solomon
as
its
root
in
dependence
on
the
sacred
ark
for
which
there
is
early
testimony
and
which
in
the
time
of
david
and
also
before
it
was
sheltered
by
a
tent
from
the
temple
it
derives
at
once
its
inner
character
and
its
central
importance
for
the
cultus
as
well
as
its
external
form
a
peculiar
point
of
view
is
taken
up
by
theodor
noldeke
he
grants
the
premisses
that
the
tabernacle
is
a
fiction
of
which
the
object
is
to
give
to
the
temple
and
to
the
unity
of
worship
but
he
denies
the
conclusion
that
in
that
case
the
priestly
code
presuppose
the
unity
of
worship
as
already
existing
in
its
day
and
therefore
is
late
than
deuteronomy
in
his
untersuchungen
zur
kritik
des
alten
testaments
seq
he
says
a
strong
tendency
towards
unity
of
worship
must
have
arisen
as
soon
as
solomon
temple
was
built
over
against
the
splendid
sanctuary
with
its
imageless
worship
at
the
centre
of
the
kingdom
of
judah
the
older
holy
places
must
ever
have
shrunk
farther
into
the
background
and
that
not
merely
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
but
quite
specially
also
in
those
of
the
better
classes
and
of
those
whose
spiritual
advancement
was
greatest
compare
amos
iv
if
even
hezekiah
carried
out
the
unification
in
judah
with
tolerable
thoroughness
the
effort
after
it
must
surely
have
been
of
very
early
date
for
the
determination
violently
to
suppress
old
sacred
usages
would
not
have
been
easily
made
unless
this
had
been
long
previously
demanded
by
theory
the
priests
at
jerusalem
must
very
specially
at
an
early
date
have
arrived
at
the
conception
that
their
temple
with
the
sacred
ark
and
the
great
altar
was
the
one
true
place
of
worship
and
an
author
has
clothed
this
very
laudable
effort
on
behalf
of
the
purity
of
religion
in
the
form
of
a
law
which
certainly
in
its
strictness
was
quite
impracticable
ileviticus
seq
and
which
therefore
was
modified
later
by
the
deuteronomist
with
a
view
to
practice
what
must
have
happened
is
of
less
consequence
to
know
than
what
actually
took
place
noldeke
relies
solely
upon
the
statement
of
that
hezekiah
abolished
the
high
places
and
altars
of
jehovah
and
said
to
judah
and
jerusalem
before
this
altar
shall
ye
worship
in
jerusalem
with
reference
to
that
statement
doubts
have
already
been
raised
above
how
startling
was
the
effect
produced
at
a
later
date
by
the
similar
ordinance
of
josiah
is
it
likely
then
that
the
other
although
the
earlier
should
have
passed
off
so
quietly
and
have
left
so
little
mark
that
the
reinforcement
of
it
after
an
interval
of
seventy
or
eighty
years
is
not
in
the
least
brought
into
connection
with
it
but
in
every
respect
figures
as
a
new
first
step
upon
a
path
until
then
absolutely
untrodden
note
too
how
casual
is
the
allusion
to
a
matter
which
is
elsewhere
the
chief
and
most
favoured
theme
of
the
book
of
kings
and
there
is
besides
all
this
the
serious
difficulty
also
already
referred
to
above
that
the
man
from
whom
hezekiah
must
from
the
nature
of
the
case
have
received
the
impulse
to
his
reformatory
movement
the
prophet
isaiah
in
one
of
his
latest
discourses
expressly
insists
on
a
cleansing
merely
of
the
local
sanctuaries
from
molten
and
graven
images
that
is
to
say
does
not
desire
their
complete
removal
so
much
at
least
is
certain
that
if
the
alleged
fact
at
present
under
discussion
amounts
to
anything
at
all
little
importance
is
to
be
attached
to
the
narrative
of
the
assyrian
siege
of
jerusalem
is
not
a
contemporary
one
as
appears
generally
from
the
entirely
indefinite
character
of
the
statements
about
the
sudden
withdrawal
of
the
assyrians
and
its
causes
and
particularly
from
for
in
this
passage
the
meaning
certainly
is
that
sennacherib
was
assassinated
soon
after
the
unsuccessful
expedition
of
but
in
point
of
fact
he
actually
reigned
until
or
smith
assyrian
eponym
canon
pp
thus
the
narrator
writes
not
twenty
years
merely
after
the
event
but
so
long
after
it
as
to
make
possible
the
elision
of
those
twenty
years
probably
he
is
already
under
the
influence
of
deuteronomy
is
certainly
of
greater
weight
than
but
although
highly
authentic
statements
have
been
preserved
to
us
in
the
epitome
of
the
book
of
kings
they
have
all
nevertheless
been
subjected
not
merely
to
the
selection
but
also
to
the
revision
of
the
deuteronomic
redactor
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
author
thought
himself
justified
in
giving
his
subject
a
generalised
treatment
according
to
which
the
cleansing
of
the
temple
at
jerusalem
in
the
first
instance
from
idols
urged
by
isaiah
and
carried
out
by
hezekiah
was
changed
into
an
abolition
of
the
bamoth
with
their
macceboth
and
asherim
it
is
well
known
how
indifferent
later
writers
are
to
distinctions
of
time
and
degree
in
the
heresy
of
unlawful
worship
they
always
go
at
once
to
the
completed
product
but
in
actual
experience
the
reformation
was
doubtless
accomplished
step
by
step
at
first
we
have
in
hosea
and
isaiah
the
polemic
directed
against
molten
and
graven
images
then
in
jeremiah
that
against
wood
and
stone
against
macceboth
and
asherim
the
movement
originated
with
the
prophets
and
the
chief
or
rather
the
only
weight
is
to
be
attached
to
their
authentic
testimony
hezekiah
only
made
a
feeble
and
wholly
ineffectual
attempt
in
this
direction
and
by
no
means
carried
out
the
unification
in
judah
with
tolerable
thoroughness
at
the
same
time
one
might
concede
even
this
last
point
and
yet
not
give
any
ground
for
the
theory
at
which
noldeke
wishes
to
arrive
for
his
assumption
is
that
the
effort
after
unity
had
its
old
and
original
seat
precisely
in
the
priestly
circles
of
jerusalem
if
the
priestly
code
is
older
than
deuteronomy
then
of
course
the
prophetic
agitation
for
reform
of
worship
in
which
deuteronomy
had
its
origin
must
have
been
only
the
repetition
of
an
older
priestly
movement
in
the
same
direction
but
of
the
latter
we
hear
not
a
single
word
while
we
can
follow
the
course
of
the
former
fairly
well
from
its
beginnings
in
thought
down
to
its
issue
in
a
practical
result
it
was
amos
hosea
and
isaiah
who
introduced
the
movement
against
the
old
popular
worship
of
the
high
places
in
doing
so
they
are
not
in
the
least
actuated
by
a
preference
for
the
temple
of
jerusalem
but
by
ethical
motives
which
manifest
themselves
in
them
for
the
first
time
in
history
and
which
we
can
see
springing
up
in
them
before
our
very
eyes
their
utterances
though
historically
occasioned
by
the
sanctuaries
of
northern
israel
are
quite
general
and
are
directed
against
the
cultus
as
a
whole
of
the
influence
of
a
point
of
view
even
remotely
akin
to
the
priestly
position
that
worship
in
this
or
that
special
place
is
of
more
value
than
anywhere
else
and
on
that
account
alone
deserves
to
be
preserved
no
trace
is
to
be
found
in
them
their
polemic
is
a
purely
prophetic
one
individual
theopneust
in
the
sense
that
it
is
independent
of
all
traditional
and
preconceived
human
opinions
but
the
subsequent
development
is
dependent
upon
this
absolutely
original
commencement
and
has
its
issue
not
in
the
priestly
code
but
in
deuteronomy
a
book
that
with
all
reasonable
regard
for
the
priests
though
not
more
for
those
of
jerusalem
than
for
the
others
still
does
not
belie
its
prophetic
origin
and
above
all
things
is
absolutely
free
from
all
and
every
hierocratic
tendency
and
finally
it
was
deuteronomy
that
brought
about
the
historical
result
of
josiah
reformation
thus
the
whole
historical
movement
now
under
our
consideration
so
far
as
it
was
effective
and
thereby
has
come
to
our
knowledge
is
in
its
origin
and
essence
prophetic
even
if
latterly
it
may
have
been
aided
by
priestly
influences
and
it
not
merely
can
but
must
be
understood
from
itself
any
older
or
independent
contemporary
priestly
movement
in
the
same
direction
remained
at
least
entirely
without
result
and
so
also
has
left
no
witnesses
to
itself
perhaps
it
occurs
to
us
that
the
priests
of
jerusalem
must
after
all
have
been
the
first
to
catch
sight
of
the
goal
the
attainment
of
which
afterwards
brought
so
great
advantage
to
themselves
but
it
does
not
appear
that
they
were
so
clever
beforehand
as
we
are
after
the
event
at
least
there
are
no
other
grounds
for
the
hypothesis
of
a
long
previously
latent
tendency
towards
centralisation
on
the
part
of
the
jerusalem
priesthood
beyond
the
presumption
that
the
priestiy
code
must
chronologically
precede
not
deuteronomy
merely
but
also
the
prophets
for
the
sake
of
this
presumption
there
is
constructed
a
purely
abstract
and
as
such
perfectly
irrefragable
possibility
that
furnishes
a
door
of
escape
from
the
historical
probability
which
nevertheless
it
is
impossible
to
evade
how
absolutely
unknown
the
priestly
code
continued
to
be
even
down
to
the
middle
of
the
exile
can
be
seen
from
the
books
of
kings
which
can
not
have
received
their
present
shape
earlier
than
the
death
of
nebuchadnezzar
the
redactor
who
cites
the
deuteronomic
law
and
constantly
forms
his
judgment
in
accordance
with
it
considered
as
we
have
learned
from
that
the
bamoth
were
permissible
prior
to
the
building
of
temple
the
tabernacle
therefore
did
not
exist
for
him
jeremiah
who
flourished
about
a
generation
earlier
is
equally
ignorant
of
it
but
on
account
of
the
ark
though
not
necessarily
in
agreement
with
traditional
opinion
regards
the
house
of
god
at
shiloh
whose
ruins
it
would
seem
were
at
that
time
still
visible
as
the
forerunner
of
the
temple
of
jerusalem
and
in
this
he
is
followed
by
the
anonymous
prophecy
of
the
comparatively
recent
date
of
which
appears
from
the
language
and
from
the
circumstance
that
it
anticipates
the
following
threatening
in
iii
in
all
these
writers
and
still
more
in
the
case
of
the
deuteronomist
himself
who
in
xii
actually
makes
the
unity
of
the
cultus
dependent
on
the
previous
choice
of
jerusalem
it
is
an
exceedingly
remarkable
thing
that
if
the
priestly
code
had
been
then
already
a
long
time
in
existence
they
should
have
been
ignorant
of
a
book
so
important
and
so
profound
in
its
practical
bearings
in
ancient
hebrew
literature
such
an
oversight
could
not
be
made
so
easily
as
in
similar
circumstances
with
the
literature
of
the
present
day
and
how
comes
it
to
pass
that
in
the
book
of
chronicles
dating
from
the
third
century
the
priestly
code
suddenly
ceases
to
be
to
all
outward
seeming
dead
but
asserts
its
influence
everywhere
over
the
narrative
in
only
too
active
and
unmistakable
a
way
to
these
difficulties
noldeke
is
unreasonably
indifferent
he
seems
to
be
of
the
opinion
that
the
time
would
not
have
ventured
to
take
in
hand
so
thoroughgoing
an
alteration
or
rather
reconstruction
of
tradition
as
is
implied
in
antedating
the
temple
of
solomon
by
means
of
the
tabernacle
jahrb
fuer
prot
and
now
let
me
ask
whether
a
document
of
this
kind
presenting
as
it
does
a
picture
of
the
history
land
distribution
and
sacrificial
rites
of
israel
as
a
whole
which
in
so
many
particulars
departs
from
the
actual
truth
can
belong
to
a
time
in
which
israel
clung
to
what
was
traditional
with
such
timid
anxiety
but
it
is
on
the
contrary
precisely
the
mark
which
distinguished
the
writers
that
they
treat
in
the
freest
possible
manner
in
accordance
with
their
own
ideas
the
institutions
of
the
bygone
past
with
which
their
time
was
no
longer
connected
by
any
living
bond
for
what
reason
does
chronicles
stand
in
the
canon
at
all
if
not
in
order
to
teach
us
this
but
when
noldeke
excuses
the
ignorance
with
regard
to
the
tabernacle
on
the
plea
that
it
is
a
mere
creature
of
the
brain
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
the
author
in
his
statements
as
in
his
laws
does
not
depict
actual
relations
but
in
the
first
instance
his
own
theories
and
ideals
hence
the
glorification
of
the
tabernacle
he
for
the
moment
forgets
that
there
underlies
this
creation
the
very
real
idea
of
unity
of
worship
for
the
sake
of
which
it
would
surely
have
been
very
welcome
to
the
deuteronomist
for
example
even
as
a
mere
idea
it
is
only
the
embodiment
of
the
tabernacle
that
is
fancy
the
idea
of
it
springs
from
the
ground
of
history
and
it
is
by
its
idea
that
it
is
to
be
apprehended
and
when
noldeke
finally
urges
in
this
connection
as
a
plea
for
the
priority
of
the
priestly
code
that
in
spite
of
the
limitation
of
sacrifice
to
a
single
locality
it
nevertheless
maintains
the
old
provision
that
every
act
of
killing
must
be
a
sacrifice
while
deuteronomy
going
a
step
farther
departs
from
this
here
also
his
argument
breaks
down
for
we
read
in
leviticus
what
man
soever
there
be
of
the
house
of
israel
that
killeth
an
ox
or
sheep
or
goat
in
the
camp
or
out
of
the
camp
and
bringeth
it
not
to
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
to
offer
them
as
an
offering
unto
the
lord
before
the
tabernacle
of
the
lord
blood
shall
be
imputed
unto
that
man
he
hath
shed
blood
and
that
man
shall
be
cut
off
from
among
his
people
to
the
end
that
the
children
of
israel
may
bring
their
sacrifices
which
they
offer
in
the
open
field
even
that
they
may
bring
them
to
the
lord
to
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
to
the
priest
and
offer
them
for
unto
the
lord
they
shall
no
more
offer
sacrifices
unto
devils
after
whom
they
have
gone
a
whoring
the
intention
of
this
prescription
is
simply
and
solely
to
secure
the
exclusive
legitimation
of
the
one
lawful
place
of
sacrifice
it
is
only
for
this
obviously
that
the
profane
slaughtering
outside
of
jerusalem
which
deuteronomy
had
permitted
is
forbidden
plainly
the
common
man
did
not
quite
understand
the
newly
drawn
and
previously
quite
unknown
distinction
between
the
religious
and
the
profane
act
and
when
he
slaughtered
at
home
as
he
was
entitled
to
do
he
in
doing
so
still
observed
perhaps
the
old
sacred
sacrificial
ritual
from
this
arose
the
danger
of
a
multiplicity
of
altars
again
furtively
creeping
in
and
such
a
danger
is
met
in
an
utterly
impracticable
way
indeed
in
leviticus
xvii
and
it
is
worth
noticing
how
much
this
law
which
for
the
rest
is
based
upon
the
book
of
deuteronomy
has
grown
in
the
narrowness
of
its
legitimistic
mode
of
viewing
things
deuteronomy
thoroughly
recognises
that
offerings
even
though
offered
outside
of
jerusalem
are
still
offered
to
jehovah
for
the
author
of
leviticus
xvii
this
is
an
impossible
idea
and
he
regards
such
offerings
simply
as
made
to
devils
with
reference
to
these
rural
demons
compare
my
note
in
vakidi
maghazi
berlin
it
is
somewhat
similar
though
not
quite
the
same
thing
when
the
moslems
say
that
the
old
arabs
dedicated
their
worship
to
the
jinns
and
other
instances
may
be
compared
in
which
divinities
have
been
degraded
to
demons
i
refuse
to
believe
that
any
such
thing
could
have
been
possible
for
one
who
lived
before
the
deuteronomic
reformation
or
even
under
the
old
conditions
that
were
in
existence
immediately
before
the
exile
leviticus
moreover
belongs
confessedly
to
a
peculiar
little
collection
of
laws
which
has
indeed
been
taken
up
into
the
priestly
code
but
which
in
many
respects
disagrees
with
it
and
particularly
in
respect
of
this
prohibition
of
profane
slaughterings
with
reference
to
the
priestly
code
as
a
whole
noldeke
assertion
is
quite
off
the
mark
the
code
on
the
contrary
already
allows
slaughter
without
sacrifice
in
the
precepts
of
noah
which
are
valid
not
merely
for
all
the
world
but
also
for
the
jews
farther
on
this
permission
is
not
expressly
repeated
indeed
but
it
is
regarded
as
a
thing
of
course
this
alone
can
account
for
the
fact
that
the
is
treated
so
entirely
as
a
subordinate
affair
and
the
sacrificial
meal
almost
ignored
while
in
leviticus
rules
are
even
given
for
procedure
in
the
slaughter
of
such
animals
as
are
not
sacrificed
that
leviticus
is
not
a
repetition
of
the
old
and
fuller
regulations
about
the
but
an
appendix
containing
new
ones
relating
to
slaughtering
is
clear
from
the
beast
of
which
men
offer
an
offering
unto
the
lord
ver
and
in
all
your
dwellings
ver
as
well
as
from
the
praxis
of
judaism
here
accordingly
is
another
instance
of
what
we
have
already
so
often
observed
what
is
brought
forward
in
deuteronomy
as
an
innovation
is
assumed
in
the
priestly
code
to
be
an
ancient
custom
dating
as
far
back
as
to
noah
and
therefore
the
latter
code
is
a
growth
of
the
soil
that
has
been
prepared
by
means
of
the
former
chapter
ii
sacrifice
with
the
hebrews
as
with
the
whole
ancient
world
sacrifice
constituted
the
main
part
of
worship
the
question
is
whether
their
worship
did
not
also
in
this
most
important
respect
pass
through
a
history
the
stages
of
which
are
reflected
in
the
pentateuch
from
the
results
already
reached
this
must
be
regarded
at
the
outset
as
probable
but
the
sources
of
information
accessible
to
us
seem
hardly
sufficient
to
enable
us
actually
to
follow
the
process
or
even
so
much
as
definitely
to
fix
its
two
termini
the
priestly
code
alone
occupies
itself
much
with
the
subject
it
gives
a
minute
classification
of
the
various
kinds
of
offerings
and
a
description
of
the
procedure
to
be
followed
in
the
case
of
each
in
this
way
it
furnishes
also
the
normative
scheme
for
modern
accounts
of
the
matter
into
which
all
the
other
casual
notices
of
the
old
testament
on
the
subject
must
be
made
to
fit
as
best
they
can
this
point
accordingly
presents
us
with
an
important
feature
by
which
the
character
of
the
book
can
be
determined
in
it
the
sacrificial
ritual
is
a
constituent
and
indeed
a
very
essential
element
of
the
mosaic
legislation
that
ritual
is
not
represented
as
ancient
use
handed
down
to
the
israelites
by
living
practice
from
ancestral
times
it
was
moses
who
gave
them
the
theory
of
it
a
very
elaborate
one
too
and
he
himself
received
his
instruction
from
god
exodus
xxv
seq
leviticus
i
an
altogether
disproportionate
emphasis
is
accordingly
laid
upon
the
technique
of
sacrifice
corresponding
to
the
theory
alike
upon
the
when
the
where
and
the
by
whom
and
also
in
a
very
special
manner
upon
the
how
it
is
from
these
that
the
sacrifice
obtains
its
specific
value
one
could
almost
suppose
that
even
if
it
were
offered
to
another
god
it
would
by
means
of
the
legitimate
rite
alone
be
at
once
made
essentially
jehovistic
the
cultus
of
israel
is
essentially
distinguished
from
all
others
by
its
form
the
distinctive
and
constitutive
mark
of
the
holy
community
with
it
the
theocracy
begins
and
it
with
the
theocracy
the
latter
is
nothing
more
than
the
institution
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
the
cultus
after
the
manner
ordained
by
god
for
this
reason
also
the
ritual
which
appears
to
concern
the
priests
only
finds
its
place
in
a
intended
for
the
whole
community
in
order
to
participate
in
the
life
of
the
theocracy
all
must
of
course
have
clear
knowledge
of
its
essential
nature
and
in
this
the
theory
of
sacrifice
holds
a
first
place
the
jehovistic
portion
of
the
pentateuch
also
knows
of
no
other
kind
of
divine
worship
besides
the
sacrificial
and
does
not
attach
to
it
less
importance
than
the
priestly
code
but
we
do
not
find
many
traces
of
the
view
that
the
sacrificial
system
of
israel
is
distinguished
from
all
others
by
a
special
form
revealed
to
moses
which
makes
it
the
sic
alone
legitimate
sacrifice
is
sacrifice
when
offered
to
baal
it
is
heathenish
when
offered
to
jehovah
it
is
israelite
in
the
book
of
the
covenant
and
in
both
decalogues
it
is
enjoined
before
everything
to
serve
no
other
god
besides
jehovah
but
also
at
the
proper
season
to
offer
firstlings
and
gifts
to
him
negative
determinations
for
the
most
part
directed
against
one
heathenish
peculiarity
or
another
occur
but
there
are
no
positive
ordinances
relating
to
the
ritual
how
one
is
to
set
about
offering
sacrifice
is
taken
for
granted
as
already
known
and
nowhere
figures
as
an
affair
for
the
legislation
which
on
the
contrary
occupies
itself
with
quite
other
things
what
the
book
of
the
covenant
and
the
decalogue
leave
still
perhaps
doubtful
becomes
abundantly
clear
from
the
jehovistic
narrative
the
narrative
has
much
more
to
say
about
sacrifice
than
the
incorporated
law
books
and
this
may
be
regarded
as
characteristic
in
the
priestly
code
it
is
quite
the
other
way
but
what
is
specially
important
is
that
according
to
the
jehovistic
history
the
praxis
of
sacrifice
and
that
too
of
the
regular
and
sort
extends
far
beyond
the
mosaic
legislation
and
strictly
speaking
is
as
old
as
the
world
itself
a
sacrificial
feast
which
the
hebrews
wish
to
celebrate
in
the
wilderness
is
the
occasion
of
the
exodus
moses
already
builds
an
altar
at
rephidim
exodus
xvii
and
still
before
the
ratification
of
the
covenant
on
sinai
a
solemn
meal
in
the
presence
of
jehovah
is
set
on
foot
on
occasion
of
jethro
visit
exodus
but
the
custom
is
much
older
still
it
was
known
and
practiced
by
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
noah
the
father
of
all
mankind
built
the
first
altar
after
the
flood
and
long
before
him
cain
and
abel
sacrificed
in
the
same
way
as
was
usual
in
palestine
thousands
of
years
afterwards
balaam
the
aramaean
understands
just
as
well
as
any
israelite
how
to
offer
sacrifices
to
jehovah
that
do
not
fail
of
their
effect
all
this
brings
out
with
as
much
clearness
as
could
be
desired
that
sacrifice
is
a
very
ancient
and
quite
universal
mode
of
honouring
the
deity
and
that
israelite
sacrifice
is
distinguished
not
by
the
manner
in
which
but
by
the
being
to
whom
it
is
offered
in
being
offered
to
the
god
of
israel
according
to
this
representation
of
the
matter
moses
left
the
procedure
in
sacrifice
as
he
left
the
procedure
in
prayer
to
be
regulated
by
the
traditional
praxis
if
there
was
any
definite
origination
of
the
cultus
of
israel
the
patriarchs
must
be
thought
of
but
even
they
were
not
the
discoverers
of
the
ritual
they
were
merely
the
founders
of
those
holy
places
at
which
the
israelites
dedicated
gifts
to
jehovah
a
usage
which
was
common
to
the
whole
world
the
contrast
with
the
priestly
code
is
extremely
striking
for
it
is
well
known
that
the
latter
work
makes
mention
of
no
sacrificial
act
prior
to
the
time
of
moses
neither
in
genesis
nor
in
exodus
although
from
the
time
of
noah
slaughtering
is
permitted
the
offering
of
a
sacrifice
of
sheep
and
oxen
as
the
occasion
of
the
exodus
is
omitted
and
in
place
of
the
sacrifice
of
the
firstlings
we
have
the
paschal
lamb
which
is
slaughtered
and
eaten
without
altar
without
priest
and
not
in
the
presence
of
jehovah
with
regard
to
sacrifice
deuteronomy
still
occupies
the
same
standpoint
as
je
the
belief
that
the
cultus
goes
back
to
usage
is
unquestionably
more
natural
than
the
belief
that
it
is
the
main
element
of
the
sinaitic
legislation
the
thought
would
be
a
strange
one
that
god
should
suddenly
have
revealed
or
moses
discovered
and
introduced
the
proper
sacrificial
ritual
at
the
same
time
this
does
not
necessitate
the
conclusion
that
the
priestly
code
is
later
than
the
jehovist
nor
does
this
follow
from
the
very
technique
of
the
agenda
for
elaborate
ritual
may
have
existed
in
the
great
sanctuaries
at
a
very
early
period
though
that
indeed
would
not
prove
it
to
be
genuinely
mosaic
on
the
other
hand
it
is
certainly
a
consideration
deserving
of
great
weight
that
the
representation
of
the
exclusive
legitimacy
of
so
definite
a
sacrificial
ritual
treated
in
the
priestly
code
as
the
only
possible
one
in
israel
is
one
which
can
have
arisen
only
as
a
consequence
of
the
centralisation
of
the
cultus
at
jerusalem
yet
by
urging
this
the
decision
of
the
question
at
present
before
us
would
only
be
referred
back
to
the
result
already
arrived
at
in
the
preceding
chapter
and
it
is
much
to
be
desired
that
it
should
be
solved
independently
so
as
not
to
throw
too
much
weight
upon
a
single
support
in
this
case
also
the
elements
of
a
decision
can
only
be
obtained
from
the
historical
documents
dating
from
the
time
the
books
of
judges
samuel
and
kings
on
the
one
hand
and
the
writings
of
the
prophets
on
the
other
as
regards
those
of
the
first
class
they
represent
the
cultus
and
sacrifice
on
all
occasions
as
occupying
a
large
place
in
the
life
of
the
nation
and
of
the
individual
but
although
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
absolutely
no
weight
is
attached
to
the
rite
it
is
certainly
not
the
fact
that
the
main
stress
is
laid
upon
it
the
antithesis
is
not
between
rite
and
but
between
sacrifice
to
jehovah
and
sacrifice
to
strange
gods
the
reverse
of
what
we
find
in
the
priestly
code
alongside
of
splendid
sacrifices
such
as
those
of
the
kings
presumably
offered
in
accordance
with
all
the
rules
of
priestly
skill
there
occur
others
also
of
the
simplest
and
most
primitive
type
as
for
example
those
of
saul
and
elisha
both
kinds
are
proper
if
only
they
be
dedicated
to
the
proper
deity
apart
from
the
exilian
redaction
of
the
book
of
kings
which
reckons
the
cultus
outside
of
jerusalem
as
heretical
it
is
nowhere
represented
that
a
sacrifice
could
be
dedicated
to
the
god
of
israel
and
yet
be
illegitimate
naaman
it
is
to
be
supposed
followed
his
native
syrian
ritual
but
this
does
not
in
the
least
impair
the
acceptability
of
his
offering
for
reasons
easily
explained
it
is
seldom
that
an
occasion
arises
to
describe
the
ritual
but
when
such
a
description
is
given
it
is
only
with
violence
that
it
can
be
forced
into
accordance
with
the
formula
of
the
law
most
striking
of
all
is
the
procedure
of
gideon
in
judges
in
which
it
is
manifest
that
the
procedure
still
usual
at
ophrah
in
the
time
of
the
narrator
is
also
set
forth
gideon
boils
a
and
bakes
in
the
ashes
cakes
of
unleavened
bread
places
upon
the
bread
the
flesh
in
a
basket
and
the
broth
in
a
pot
and
then
the
meal
thus
prepared
is
burnt
in
the
altar
flame
it
is
possible
that
instances
may
have
also
occurred
in
which
the
rule
of
the
pentateuch
is
followed
but
the
important
point
is
that
the
distinction
between
legitimate
and
heretical
is
altogether
wanting
when
the
book
of
chronicles
is
compared
the
difference
is
at
once
perceived
the
impression
derived
from
the
historical
books
is
confirmed
by
the
prophets
it
is
true
that
in
their
polemic
against
confounding
worship
with
religion
they
reveal
the
fact
that
in
their
day
the
cultus
was
carried
on
with
the
utmost
zeal
and
splendour
and
was
held
in
the
highest
estimation
but
this
estimation
does
not
rest
upon
the
opinion
that
the
cultus
as
regards
its
matter
goes
back
to
moses
or
to
jehovah
himself
gives
to
the
theocracy
its
distinctive
character
and
even
constitutes
the
supernatural
priesthood
of
israel
among
the
nations
but
simply
upon
the
belief
that
jehovah
must
be
honoured
by
his
dependents
just
as
other
gods
are
by
their
subjects
by
means
of
offerings
and
gifts
as
being
the
natural
and
like
prayer
universally
current
expressions
of
religious
homage
the
larger
the
quantity
and
the
finer
the
quality
so
much
the
better
but
that
the
merit
arising
from
the
presentation
depends
upon
strict
observance
of
etiquette
regarded
as
jehovah
law
is
not
suggested
thus
it
is
that
the
prophets
are
able
to
ask
whether
then
jehovah
has
commanded
his
people
to
tax
their
energies
with
such
exertions
the
fact
presupposed
being
that
no
such
command
exists
and
that
no
one
knows
anything
at
all
about
a
ritual
torah
amos
the
leader
of
the
chorus
says
seq
come
to
bethel
to
sin
to
gilgal
to
sin
yet
more
and
bring
your
sacrifices
every
morning
your
tithes
every
three
days
for
so
ye
like
ye
children
of
israel
in
passing
sentence
of
rejection
upon
the
value
of
the
cultus
he
is
in
opposition
to
the
faith
of
his
time
but
if
the
opinion
had
been
a
current
one
that
precisely
the
cultus
was
what
jehovah
had
instituted
in
israel
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
say
for
so
ye
like
ye
not
jehovah
it
is
an
idle
and
arbitrary
worship
he
expresses
himself
still
more
clearly
in
seq
i
hate
i
despise
your
feasts
and
i
smell
not
on
your
holy
days
though
ye
offer
me
and
your
gifts
i
will
not
accept
them
neither
do
i
regard
your
of
fatted
calves
away
from
me
with
the
noise
of
thy
songs
the
melody
of
thy
viols
i
will
not
hear
but
let
judgment
roll
on
like
waters
and
righteousness
like
a
mighty
stream
did
ye
offer
unto
me
sacrifices
and
gifts
in
the
wilderness
the
forty
years
o
house
of
israel
in
asking
this
last
question
amos
has
not
the
slightest
fear
of
raising
any
controversy
on
the
contrary
he
is
following
the
generally
received
belief
his
polemic
is
directed
against
the
praxis
of
his
contemporaries
but
here
he
rests
it
upon
a
theoretical
foundation
in
which
they
are
at
one
with
him
on
this
namely
that
the
sacrificial
worship
is
not
of
mosaic
origin
lastly
if
be
genuine
it
teaches
the
same
lesson
by
the
law
of
jehovah
which
the
people
of
judah
have
despised
it
is
impossible
that
amos
can
have
understood
anything
in
the
remotest
degree
resembling
a
ritual
legislation
are
we
to
take
it
then
that
he
formed
his
own
special
private
notion
of
the
torah
how
in
that
case
would
it
have
been
possible
for
him
to
make
himself
understood
by
the
people
or
to
exercise
influence
over
them
of
all
unlikely
suppositions
at
all
events
it
is
the
least
likely
that
the
herdsman
of
tekoah
under
the
influence
of
prophetic
tradition
which
in
fact
he
so
earnestly
disclaims
should
have
taken
the
torah
for
something
quite
different
from
what
it
actually
was
hosea
isaiah
and
micah
are
in
agreement
with
amos
the
first
mentioned
complains
bitterly
seq
that
the
priests
cultivate
the
system
of
sacrifices
instead
of
the
torah
the
torah
committed
by
jehovah
to
their
order
lays
it
on
them
as
their
vocation
to
diffuse
the
knowledge
of
god
in
israel
the
knowledge
that
he
seeks
truthfulness
and
love
justice
and
considerateness
and
no
gifts
but
they
on
the
contrary
in
a
spirit
of
base
foster
the
tendency
of
the
nation
towards
cultus
in
their
superstitions
of
which
lies
their
sin
and
their
ruin
my
people
are
destroyed
for
lack
of
knowledge
ye
yourselves
ye
priests
reject
knowledge
and
i
too
will
reject
you
that
ye
shall
not
be
priests
unto
me
seeing
ye
have
forgotten
the
law
of
your
god
so
will
i
also
forget
you
the
more
they
are
the
more
they
sin
against
me
their
glory
they
barter
for
shame
they
eat
the
sin
of
my
people
and
they
set
their
heart
on
their
iniquity
from
this
we
see
how
idle
it
is
to
believe
that
the
prophets
opposed
the
law
they
defend
the
priestly
torah
which
however
has
nothing
to
do
with
cultus
but
only
with
justice
and
morality
in
another
passage
seq
we
read
ephraim
has
built
for
himself
many
altars
to
sin
the
altars
are
there
for
him
to
sin
how
many
soever
my
instructions
torothai
may
be
they
are
counted
those
of
a
stranger
this
text
has
had
the
unmerited
misfortune
of
having
been
forced
to
do
service
as
a
proof
that
hosea
knew
of
copious
writings
similar
in
contents
to
our
pentateuch
all
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
contrast
instead
of
following
my
instructions
they
offer
sacrifice
for
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
passage
is
that
the
prophet
had
never
once
dreamed
of
the
possibility
of
cultus
being
made
the
subject
of
jehovah
directions
in
isaiah
discourses
the
passage
of
the
first
chapter
belongs
to
this
connection
to
what
purpose
is
the
multitude
of
your
sacrifices
unto
me
saith
the
lord
i
am
weary
with
the
of
rams
and
the
fat
of
fed
beasts
and
i
delight
not
in
the
blood
of
bullocks
and
of
lambs
and
of
when
ye
come
to
look
upon
my
face
who
hath
required
this
at
your
hands
to
trample
my
courts
this
expression
has
long
been
a
source
of
trouble
and
certainly
the
prophet
could
not
possibly
have
uttered
it
if
the
sacrificial
worship
had
according
to
any
tradition
whatever
passed
for
being
specifically
mosaic
isaiah
uses
the
word
torah
to
denote
not
the
priestly
but
the
prophetical
instruction
as
both
have
a
common
source
and
jehovah
is
the
proper
instructor
this
is
easily
explicable
and
is
moreover
full
of
instruction
as
regards
the
idea
involved
the
contents
of
the
priestly
code
fit
badly
in
with
the
torah
of
lastly
micah
answer
to
the
people
question
how
a
return
of
the
favour
of
an
angry
god
is
to
be
secured
is
of
conspicuous
significance
seq
shall
i
come
before
him
with
with
calves
of
a
year
old
is
the
lord
pleased
with
thousands
of
rams
with
ten
thousands
of
rivers
of
oil
shall
i
give
my
for
my
transgression
the
fruit
of
my
body
as
atonement
for
my
soul
it
hath
been
told
thee
o
man
what
is
good
and
what
jehovah
requireth
of
thee
nay
it
is
to
do
justly
and
to
love
mercy
and
to
walk
humbly
before
thy
god
although
the
blunt
statement
of
the
contrast
between
cultus
and
religion
is
peculiarly
prophetic
micah
can
still
take
his
stand
upon
this
it
hath
been
told
thee
o
man
what
jehovah
requires
it
is
no
new
matter
but
a
thing
well
known
that
sacrifices
are
not
what
the
torah
of
the
lord
contains
that
we
have
not
inferred
too
much
from
these
utterances
of
the
older
prophets
is
clear
from
the
way
in
which
they
are
taken
up
and
carried
on
by
jeremiah
who
lived
shortly
before
the
babylonian
exile
just
as
in
seq
he
opposes
the
torah
to
the
cultus
so
in
seq
he
thus
expresses
himself
add
your
to
your
sacrifices
and
eat
flesh
for
i
said
nought
unto
your
fathers
and
commanded
them
nought
in
the
day
that
i
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
concerning
or
sacrifices
but
this
thing
commanded
i
them
hearken
to
my
voice
and
i
will
be
your
god
and
ye
shall
be
my
people
and
walk
ye
in
the
way
that
i
shall
always
teach
you
that
it
may
be
well
with
you
the
view
indeed
that
the
prophets
who
from
the
connection
are
the
voice
to
which
israel
is
to
hearken
are
the
proper
soul
of
the
theocracy
the
organ
by
which
jehovah
influences
and
rules
it
has
no
claim
to
immemorial
antiquity
but
no
stress
lies
upon
the
positive
element
here
enough
that
at
all
events
jeremiah
is
unacquainted
with
the
mosaic
legislation
as
it
is
contained
in
the
priestly
code
his
ignoring
of
it
is
not
intentional
for
he
is
far
from
hating
the
cultus
but
as
priest
and
prophet
staying
continually
in
the
temple
at
jerusalem
he
must
have
known
it
if
it
had
existed
and
actually
been
codified
the
fact
is
one
which
it
is
difficult
to
get
over
thus
the
historical
witnesses
particularly
the
prophets
decide
the
matter
in
favour
of
the
jehovistic
tradition
according
to
the
universal
opinion
of
the
period
the
cultus
is
indeed
of
very
old
and
to
the
people
very
sacred
usage
but
not
a
mosaic
institution
the
ritual
is
not
the
main
thing
in
it
and
is
in
no
sense
the
subject
with
which
the
torah
deals
that
the
priests
were
not
mere
teachers
of
law
and
morals
but
also
gave
ritual
instruction
regarding
cleanness
and
uncleanness
is
of
course
not
denied
by
this
all
that
is
asserted
is
that
in
antiquity
the
priests
own
praxis
at
the
altar
never
constituted
the
contents
of
the
torah
but
that
their
torah
always
consisted
of
instructions
to
the
laity
the
distinction
is
easily
intelligible
to
those
who
choose
to
understand
it
in
other
words
no
trace
can
be
found
of
acquaintance
with
the
priestly
code
but
on
the
other
hand
very
clear
indications
of
ignorance
of
its
contents
in
this
matter
the
transition
from
the
to
the
period
is
effected
not
by
deuteronomy
but
by
ezekiel
the
priest
in
prophet
mantle
who
was
one
of
the
first
to
be
carried
into
exile
he
stands
in
striking
contrast
with
his
elder
contemporary
jeremiah
in
the
picture
of
israel
future
which
he
drew
in
chaps
in
which
fantastic
hopes
are
indeed
built
upon
jehovah
but
no
impossible
demand
made
of
man
the
temple
and
cultus
hold
a
central
place
whence
this
sudden
change
perhaps
because
now
the
priestly
code
has
suddenly
awakened
to
life
after
its
long
trance
and
become
the
inspiration
of
ezekiel
the
explanation
is
certainly
not
to
be
sought
in
any
such
occurrence
but
simply
in
the
historical
circumstances
so
long
as
the
sacrificial
worship
remained
in
actual
use
it
was
zealously
carried
on
but
people
did
not
concern
themselves
with
it
theoretically
and
had
not
the
least
occasion
for
reducing
it
to
a
code
but
once
the
temple
was
in
ruins
the
cultus
at
an
end
its
personnel
out
of
employment
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
the
sacred
praxis
should
have
become
a
matter
of
theory
and
writing
so
that
it
might
not
altogether
perish
and
how
an
exiled
priest
should
have
begun
to
paint
the
picture
of
it
as
he
carried
it
in
his
memory
and
to
publish
it
as
a
programme
for
the
future
restoration
of
the
theocracy
nor
is
there
any
difficulty
if
arrangements
which
as
long
as
they
were
actually
in
force
were
simply
regarded
as
natural
were
seen
after
their
abolition
in
a
transfiguring
light
and
from
the
study
devoted
to
them
gained
artificially
a
still
higher
value
these
historical
conditions
supplied
by
the
exile
sufffice
to
make
clear
the
transition
from
jeremiah
to
ezekiel
and
the
genesis
of
ezekiel
the
of
the
priestly
code
is
here
not
merely
unnecessary
it
would
be
absolutely
disconcerting
ezekiel
departure
from
the
ritual
of
the
pentateuch
can
not
be
explained
as
intentional
alterations
of
the
original
they
are
too
casual
and
insignificant
the
prophet
moreover
has
the
rights
of
authorship
as
regards
the
end
of
his
book
as
well
as
for
the
rest
of
it
he
has
also
his
right
to
his
picture
of
the
future
as
the
earlier
prophets
had
to
theirs
and
finally
let
its
due
weight
be
given
to
the
simple
fact
that
an
exiled
priest
saw
occasion
to
draft
such
a
sketch
of
the
temple
worship
what
need
would
there
have
been
for
it
if
the
realised
picture
corresponding
completely
to
his
views
had
actually
existed
and
being
already
written
in
a
book
wholly
obviated
any
danger
lest
the
cultus
should
become
extinct
through
the
mere
fact
of
its
temporary
cessation
here
again
a
way
of
escape
is
open
by
assuming
a
lifeless
existence
of
the
law
down
to
ezra
time
but
if
this
is
done
it
is
unallowable
to
date
that
existence
not
from
moses
but
from
some
other
intermediate
point
in
the
history
of
israel
moreover
the
assumption
of
a
codification
either
as
preceding
all
praxis
or
as
alongside
and
independent
of
it
is
precisely
in
the
case
of
sacrificial
ritual
one
of
enormous
difficulty
for
it
is
obvious
that
such
a
codification
can
only
be
the
final
result
of
an
old
and
highly
developed
use
and
not
the
invention
of
an
idle
brain
this
consideration
also
makes
retreat
into
the
theory
of
an
illegal
praxis
impossible
and
renders
the
legitimacy
of
the
actually
subsisting
indisputable
at
all
times
then
the
sacrificial
worship
of
israel
existed
and
had
great
importance
attached
to
it
but
in
the
earlier
period
it
rested
upon
custom
inherited
from
the
fathers
in
the
on
the
law
of
jehovah
given
through
moses
at
first
it
was
naive
and
what
was
chiefly
considered
was
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
gifts
afterwards
it
became
legal
the
scrupulous
fulfilment
of
the
law
that
is
of
the
prescribed
ritual
was
what
was
looked
to
before
everything
was
there
then
apart
from
this
strictly
speaking
no
material
difference
to
answer
this
question
our
researches
must
be
carried
further
afield
after
some
preliminary
observations
have
been
made
in
order
to
fix
our
position
in
the
pentateuch
the
sacrificial
ritual
is
indeed
copiously
described
but
nowhere
in
the
old
testament
is
its
significance
formally
explained
this
is
treated
as
on
the
whole
and
familiar
to
every
one
the
general
notion
of
a
sacrifice
is
in
the
priestly
code

ever
been

on
the

the

both

both

not
be

when

is
at

heat
and
not
by
one
the
sight
of
whom
he
hates
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
it
the
idea
of
a
sacrifice
is
in
itself
indifferent
if
the
thing
offered
only
have
value
of
some
sort
and
is
the
property
of
the
offerer
under
and
is
included
also
that
which
the
greeks
called
the
sacred
dues
which
at
a
later
date
fall
to
the
priest
were
without
doubt
originally
ordinary
offerings
and
amongst
these
are
found
even

but
it
is
quite
in
harmony
with
the
naivete
of
antiquity
that
as
to
man
so
also
to
god
that
which
is
eatable
is
by
preference
offered
in
this
there
was
the
additional
advantage
that
what
god
had
caused
to
grow
was
thus
rendered
back
to
him
in
doing
this
the
regular
form
observed
is
that
a
meal
is
prepared
in
honour
of
the
deity
of
which
man
partakes
as
god
guest
offering
without
any
qualifying
expression
always
means
a
meat
or
drink
offering
on
this
account
the

is
called

on
this
account
also
salt
goes
along
with
flesh
oil
with

and
bread
and

with
both
and
thus
also
are
we
to
explain
why
the

according
to
rule
is
put
upon
the
altar
in
pieces

in
the
earlier
period
boiled

course
true
that
in
his
offering
the
enlightened
hebrew
saw
no
banquet
to
jehovah
but
we
hardly
think
of
taking
the
enlightened
protestant
as
a
standard
for
the
original
character
of
protestantism
the
manner
in
which
the
portions
pertaining
to
god
are
conveyed
to
him
varies
the
most
primitive
is
the
simple
setting
in
order
rk
struere
and
pouring
out
pk
fundere
in
the
case
of
the
shewbread
and
drink
offerings
to
this
a
simple
eating
and
drinking
would
correspond
but
the
most
usual
is
burning
or
as
the
hebrews
express
it
making
a
savour
to
which
corresponds
the
more
delicate
form
of
enjoyment
that
of
smelling
originally
however
it
is
god
himself
who
consumes
what
the
flame
consumes
in
any
case
the
burning
is
a
means
of
conveying
the
offering
not
as
one
might
perhaps
be
disposed
to
infer
from
the
sweet
savour
ryx

genesis
a
means
of
preparing
it
for
in
ancient
times
the
hebrews
did
not
roast
the
flesh
but
boiled
it
in
what
is
demonstrably
the
oldest
ritual

the
sacrifice
also
is
delivered
to

boiled
and
moreover
not
the
flesh
only
but
also
the
bread
and
the
meal
are
burnt
as
regards
the
distinction
between
bloodless
and
bloody
offerings
the
latter
it
is
well
known
are
preferred
in
the
old
testament
but
strictly
speaking
the
former
also
have
the
same
value
and
the
same
efficacy
the
is
represented
as
a
means
of
propitiation

also
are
the
ten
thousands
of
rivers
of
oil
figuring
between
the
thousands
of

and
the
human
sacrifice
in
micah
vi
that
the
cereal
offering
is
never
anything
but
an
accompaniment
of
the
animal
sacrifice
is
a
rule
which
does
not
hold
either
in
the
case
of
the
shewbread
or
in
that
of
the
high
daily
minxa
leviticus
vi
only
the
has
no
independent
position
and
was
not
in
any
way
the
importance
it
had
among
the
greeks
when
a
sacrifice
is
killed
the
offering
consists
not
of
the
blood
but
of
the
eatable
portions
of
the
flesh
only
these
can
be
designated
as
the
bread
of
jehovah
and
moreover
only
the
eatable
domestic
animals
can
be
presented
at
the
same
time
however
it
is
true
that
in
the
case
of
the
bloody
offerings
a
new
motive
ultimately
came
to
be
associated
with
the
original
idea
of
the
gift
the
life
of
which
the
blood
was
regarded
as
the
substance
had
for
the
ancient
semites
something
mysterious
and
divine
about
it
they
felt
a
certain
religious
scruple
about
destroying
it
with
them
flesh
was
an
uncommon
luxury
and
they
ate
it
with
quite
different
feelings
from
those
with
which
they
partook
of
fruits
or
of
milk
thus
the
act
of
killing
was
not
so
indifferent
or
merely
preparatory
a
step
as
for
example
the
cleansing
and
preparing
of
corn
on
the
contrary
the
pouring
out
of
blood
was
ventured
upon
only
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
it
back
to
the
deity
the
source
of
life
in
this
way
not
by
any
means
every
meal
indeed
but
every
slaughtering
came
to
be
a
sacrifice
what
was
primarily
aimed
at
in
it
was
a
mere
restoration
of
his
own
to
the
deity
but
there
readily
resulted
a
combination
with
the
idea
of
sacrifice
whereby
the
latter
was
itself
modified
in
a
peculiar
manner
the
atoning
efficacy
of
the
gift
began
to
be
ascribed
mainly
to
the
blood
and
to
the
vicarious
value
of
the
life
taken
away
the
outpouring
and
sprinkling
of
blood
was
in
all
sacrifices
a
rite
of
conspicuous
importance
and
even
the
act
of
slaughtering
in
the
case
of
some
and
these
the
most
valued
a
holy
act
the
features
presented
by
the
various
literary
sources
harmonise
with
the
foregoing
sketch
but
the
priestly
code
exhibits
some
peculiarities
by
which
it
is
distinguished
from
the
remains
in
matters
sacrificial
in
the
first
place
it
is
characterised
in
the
case
of
bloodless
offerings
by
a
certain
refinement
of
the
material
thus
in
the
it
will
have
slt
simila
not
qmx
far
in
the
whole
literature
the
former
is
mentioned
only
three
times
altogether
but
never
in
connection
with
sacrifice
where
on
the
contrary
the
ordinary
meal
is
used
judges
vi
i
that
this
is
no
mere
accident
appears
on
the
one
hand
from
the
fact
that
in
the
later
literature
from
ezekiel
onwards
qmx
as
sacrificial
meal
entirely
disappears
and
slt
invariably
take
its
place
on
the
other
hand
from
this
that
the
lxx
or
the
hebrew
text
from
which
that
version
was
taken
is
offended
by
the
illegality
of
the
material
in

and
alters
the
reading
so
as
to
bring
it
to
conformity

which

is
the
privilege

company
who
are
not
entitled
to
use
it
while
immediately
afterwards
in
the
hands
of

legitimate
high
priest
it
becomes
the
means
of
appeasing
the
anger
of
jehovah
and
of
staying
the
plague
now
of
this
offering
thus
invested
with
such
a
halo
of
sanctity
the
older
literature
of
the
jewish
canon
down
to
jeremiah
and
zephaniah
knows
absolutely
nothing
the
verb
there
used
invariably
and
exclusively
of
the
burning
of
fat
or
meal
and
thereby
making
to
god
a
savour
it
is
never
used
to
denote
the
offering
of
incense
and
the
substantive
as
a
sacrificial
term
has
the
quite
general
signification
of
that
which
is
burnt
on
the
altar
the
verb
is
used
in
by
the
older
writers
in
by
the
priestly
code
chronicles
and
promiscuously
in
both
forms
during
the
transition
period
by
the
author
of
the
books
of
kings
this
is
the
case
at
least
where
the
forms
can
with
certainty
be
distinguished
namely
in
the
perfect
imperative
and
infinitive
the
distinction
between
and
and
rests
as
is
well
known
upon
no
secure
tradition

shall
we

subject
by

accident
or
that
they
conspired
to
ignore
it
if
it
had
really
existed
and
been
of
so
great
consequence
surely
one
of
them
at
least
would
not
have
failed
to
speak
of
it
the
jehovistic
section
of
the
hexateuch
is
equally
silent
so
also
the
historical
books
except
chronicles
and
so
the
rest
of
the
prophets
down
to
jeremiah
who
selects
incense
as
the
example
of
a
rare
and
offering
to
what
purpose
cometh
there
to
me
incense
from
sheba
and
the
precious
cane
from
a
far
country
thenceforward
it
is
mentioned
in
ezekiel
in
isaiah
in
nehemiah
and
in
chronicles
the
references
are
continuous
the
introduction
of
incense
is
a
natural
result
of
increased
luxury
one
is
tempted
to
conjecture
that
its
use
must
have
first
crept
into
the
jehovah
worship
as
an
innovation
from
a
more
foreign
cultus
but
the
importance
which
it
has
attained
in
the
ritual
legislation
of
the
pentateuch
is
manifest
above
all
from
this
that
it
has
led
to
the
invention
of
a
peculiar
new
and
highly
sacred
piece
of
furniture
namely
the
golden
altar
in
the
inner
tabernacle
which
is
unknown
to
history
and
which
is
foreign
even
to
the
kernel
of
the
priestly
code
itself
we
expect
to
find
the
altar
of
incense
in
exodus
but
find
it
instead
as
an
appendix
at
the
beginning
of
exodus
xxx
why
not
until
now
why
thus
separated
from
the
other
furnishings
of
the
inner
sanctuary
and
not
only
so
but
even
after
the
ordinances
relating
to
the
adornment
of
the
priests
and
the
inauguration
of
the
divine
service
the
reason
why
the
author
of
chaps
is
thus
silent
about
the
altar
of
incense
in
the
passage
in
which
the
furniture
of
the
tabernacle
consisting
of
ark
table
and
candlestick
is
described
is
that
he
does
not
know
of
it
there
is
no
other
possibility
for
he
can
not
have
forgotten
it
there
is
a
peculiar
perversity
in
meeting
the
objection
by
alleging
other
singularities
in
the
ordinance
as
for
example
that
the
vessels
of
the
tabernacle
are
appointed
chap
xxv
before
the
tabernacle
itself
chap
this
last
is
no
eccentricity
the
order
in
commanding
is
first
the
end
and
then
the
means
but
in
obeying
the
order
is
reversed
in
like
manner
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
if
subsidiary
implements
such
as
benches
for
slaughtering
or
basins
for
washing
which
have
no
importance
for
the
cultus
properly
so
called
should
be
either
passed
over
altogether
or
merely
brought
in
as
an
appendix
the
case
is
not
at
all
parallel
with
the
omission
of
the
most
important
utensil
of
the
sanctuary
from
the
very
passage
to
which
it
necessarily
belongs
and
the
phenomenon
is
repeated
the
altar
of
incense
occurs
only
in
certain
portions
of
the
priestly
code
and
is
absent
from
others
where
it
could
not
possibly
have
been
omitted
had
it
been
known
the
rite
of
the
most
solemn
atoning
sacrifice
takes
place
in
leviticus
iv
indeed
on
the
golden
altar
but
in
exodus
leviticus
without
its
use
a
still
more
striking
circumstance
is
that
in
passages
where
the
holiest
itself
is
spoken
of
no
trace
can
be
discovered
of
the
corresponding
altar
this
is
particularly
the
case
in
leviticus
xvi
to
burn
incense
in
the
sanctuary
aaron
takes
a
censer
fills
it
with
coals
from
the
altar
of
ver
and
lays
the
incense
upon
them
in
the
adytum
similarly
in
leviticus
numbers
incense
is
offered
on
censers
of
which
each
priest
possesses
one
the
coals
are
taken
from
the
altar

is
plated
with
the
censers
of
the

leviticus
x
the
altar
of
incense
is
everywhere
unknown
here
the
altar
of
is
the
only
altar
and
moreover
is
always
called
simply
altar
as
for
example
even
in
exodus
where
it
would
have
been
specially
necessary
to
add
the
qualifying
expression
only
in
certain
later
portions
of
the
priestly
code
does
the
name
altar
of
occur
viz
in
those
passages
which
do
recognise
the
altar
of
incense
in
this
connection
the
command
of
exodus
xxvii
as
compared
with
the
execution
in
exodus
xxxviii
is
characteristic
the
golden
altar
in
the
sanctuary
is
originally
simply
the
golden
table
the
variation
of
the
expression
has
led
to
a
doubling
of
the
thing
ezekiel
does
not
distinguish
between
the
table
and
the
altar
in
the
temple
but
uses
either
expression
indifferently
for
he
says
seq
before
the
adytum
stood
what
looked
like
an
altar
of
wood
three
cubits
in
height
two
cubits
in
length
and
breadth
and
it
had
projecting
corners
and
its
frame
and
its
walls
were
of
wood
this
is
the
table
which
is
before
the
lord
in
like
manner
he
designates
the
service
of
the
priests
in
the
inner
sanctuary
as
table
is
the
name
altar
the
function
malachi
on
the
other
hand
designates
the
altar
of
as
a
table
in
vii
it
is
true
that
the
golden
altar
and
the
golden
table
are
mentioned
together
it
seems
strange
however
that
in
this
case
the
concluding
summary
mentions
one
piece
of
furniture
more
and
that
piece
one
of
so
great
importance
than
the
preceding
detailed
description
for
in
the
latter
only
the
preparation
of
the
golden
altar
is
spoken
of
and
nothing
is
said
of
the
golden
table
vi
as
matters
stand
nothing
is
less
improbable
than
that
some
later
transcriber
should
have
interpolated
the
golden
table
in
vii
regarding
it
in
accordance
with
the
pentateuch
as
distinct
from
the
golden
altar
and
therefore
considering
its
absence
as
an
omission
from
other
considerations
also
it
is
clear
that
the
text
of
the
whole
chapter
is
in
many
ways
corrupt
and
interpolated
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
in
the
temple
there
existed
both
a
golden
altar
and
a
golden
table
we
learn
from
i
iv
that
both
were
carried
off
by
antiochus
epiphanes
and
renewed
at
the
feast
of
the
dedication
but
it
causes
no
small
surprise
to
find
that
at
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
the
romans
found
and
carried
off
table
and
candlestick
only
what
can
have
become
in
the
meantime
of
the
golden
altar
of
incense
and
it
is
further
worth
remarking
that
in
the
lxx
the
passage
exodus
is
absent
that
is
to
say
the
altar
of
incense
is
indeed
commanded
but
there
is
no
word
of
its
execution
in
these
circumstances
finally
the
vacillating
statement
as
to
its
position
in
exodus
xxx
and
the
supposed
mistake
of
the
author
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
are
important
and
intelligible
compare
also
where
only
the
table
but
not
the
altar
is
hidden
by
jeremiah
so
much
for
the
offering
of
incense
and
its
altar
we
may
in
like
manner
venture
to
regard
it
as
a
kind
of
refinement
though
rather
a
refinement
of
idea
that
the
flesh
of
the
sacrifice
in
the
priestly
code
is
no
longer
boiled
but
consigned
to
the
altar
flames
in
its
raw
condition
such
was
not
the
ancient
custom
as
is
seen
not
only
from
the
case
of
gideon
already
cited
judges
vi
but
also
from
the
procedure
at
shiloh
described
in
where
the
sons
of
eli
will
not
wait
until
the
flesh
of
the
sacrifice
has
been
boiled
and
the
altar
pieces
burnt
but
demand
their
share
raw
for
roasting
the
meal
which
the
deity
shares
with
men
is
prepared
in
the
same
way
as
for
men
this
naive
conception
gave
way
before
advancing
culture
and
that
at
a
comparatively
early
date
it
is
possible
that
another
cause
may
also
have
towards
this
result
the
old
method
of
preparing
flesh
in
general
use
among
the
people

was
no
other
kind
accordingly
one
must
understand
h
also
of

among
persons
of
the
upper
class
roasting
must
also
have
come
into
use
at
an
early
period
give
flesh
to
roast
for
the
priest
for
he
will
not
take
sodden
flesh
of
thee
but
raw
says
the
servant
of
the
sons
of
eli
in
ii
the
fact
that
in
the
interval
the
custom
of
boiling
had
gone
generally
somewhat
out
of
fashion
may
accordingly
have
also
contributed
to
bring
about
the
abandonment
of
the
old
usage
of
offering
the
sacrificial
portions
boiled
in
any
case
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
circumstance
that
the
paschal
lamb
which
originally
was
boiled
like
all
other
offerings
could
according
to
the
express
appointment
of
the
priestly
code
be
eaten
roasted
only
compare
the
polemical
ordinance
of
exodus
xii
with
deuteronomy
xvi
the
phenomenon
that
in
the
law
meal
is
by
preference
offered
raw
while
in
the
earlier
period
even
as
an
adjunct
of
the
it
was
presented
baked
belongs
to
the
same
category
the
latter
is
the
case
in
judges
vi
at
least
and
the
statement
of
i
is
also
to
be
understood
in
the
same
sense
the
sacrificer
brings
meal
along
with
him
in
order
to
bake
it
into
on
the
spot
ezekiel
xlvi
but
he
may
bring
along
with
him
common
that
is
leavened
cakes
also
x
which
seem
originally
by
no
means
to
have
been
considered
unfit
to
be
offered
as
in
leviticus
ii
for
under
this
law
of
leviticus
ii
even
the
presentation
of
the
shewbread
would
be
inexplicable
and
moreover
it
is
certain
that
at
first
the
loaves
of
the
feast
of
weeks
were
offerings
properly
so
called
and
not
merely
dues
to
the
priests
according
to
amos
iv
leavened
bread
was
made
use
of
precisely
at
a
particularly
solemn
sacrifice
and
a
reminiscence
of
this
usage
has
been
preserved
even
in
leviticus
vii
although
of
course
without
any
practical
weight
being
attached
to
it
the
loaves
are
passed
over
in
silence
in
leviticus
vii
although
it
is
in
this
very
place
that
the
matter
of
presenting
on
the
part
of
the
offerer
is
most
fully
described
and
when
it
is
said
vii
if
he
offer
it
for
a
thanksgiving
todah
then
he
shall
offer
with
it
unleavened
cakes
mingled
with
oil
and
unleavened
wafers
anointed
with
oil
and
fine
flour
lxx
mingled
with
oil
vii
with
leavened
cakes
shall
he
offer
as
a
gift
with
the
of
the
todah
the
suspicion
very
readily
occurs
that
verse
is
an
authentic
interpretation
prefixed
to
obviate
beforehand
the
difficulty
presented
by
verse
and
that
similarly
the
first
l
in
verse
is
also
a
later
correction
which
does
not
harmonise
well
by
any
means
with
the
second
verse

itself
better
with
verse
than
with

exod

moreover
massah
also
means
properly
speaking
only
the
bread
that
is
prepared
in
haste
and
in
the
most
primitive
manner
for
immediate
use
and
originally
implies
no
contrast
with
leaven
but
simply
with
the
more
artificial
and
tedious
manners
of
producing
ordinary
bread
compare
genesis
xviii
with
in
the
priestly
code
the
materials
are
finer
but
they
are
as
much
as
possible
left
in
their
raw
condition
both
are
steps
in
advance
there
is
another
and
much
more
important
difference
in
the
case
of
the
animal
sacrifice
of
this
the
older
practice
knows
only
two
kinds
apart
from
extraordinary
varieties
which
may
be
left
out
of
account
these
two
are
the
and
the
shelem

besides
the
blood
only
an
honorary
portion
while
the
rest
of
the
flesh
is
eaten
by
the
sacrificial
guests
now
it
is
worth
noticing
how
seldom
the
occurs
alone
it
is
necessarily
so
in
the
case
of
human
sacrifice

is
probable
that

taken

the
of

perhaps
to

not
merely
general
statements
about

more
kinds
of

the

could
very

upon

alone

any
light
upon

question

is
important

most
probably
it
was

general

kind
of

properly
speaking
nothing
more
than
the
part
of
a
great
offering
that
reaches
the

one
might
therefore
designate
as
also
that
part
of
a
single
animal
which
is
consecrated
to
the
deity
this
however
is
never
done
neither
of
the

nor
of
the

is
the
verb

used

only
of
the
pieces
of
the
flesh
of
which
in
the
case
of
the
minor
offering
nothing
was
burnt
but
the
distinction
is
merely
one
of
degree
there
is
none
in
kind
a
small

enlarged
and
augmented

an

of
a

are

sacrificial
company
one
is
devoted
to
god
and
wholly
given
to
the
flames
for
the
rest
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
as
a
rule
it
is
only
great
sacrificial
feasts
that
the
historical
books
take
occasion
to
mention
and
that
consequently
the
notwithstanding
what
has
been
said
comes
before
us
with
greater
prominence
than
can
have
been
the
average

matter
of
course
ii

is
in
this
connection
also
particularly
instructive
from
what
has
been
said
it
results
that
according
to
the
praxis
of
the
older
period
a
meal
was
almost
always
connected
with
a
sacrifice
it
was
the
rule
that
only
blood
and
fat
were
laid
upon
the
altar
but
the
people
ate
the
flesh
only
in
the
case
of
very
great
sacrificial
feasts
was
a
large

to

the

the
guests
and
on
the
other
hand
between
the

themselves
reciprocally

is
essential
for
the
idea
of
sacrifice

gives
their
name

ordinary

notion

suspicion

natural
one

by
no

so
startling
as
it
appears
how
different
from
this
picture
is
that
suggested
by
the
priestly
code
here
one
no
longer
remarks
that
a
meal
accompanies
every
sacrifice
eating
before
jehovah
which
even
in
deuteronomy
is
just
the
expression
for
sacrificing
nowhere
occurs
or
at
all
events
is
no
act
of
divine
worship
slaying
and
sacrificing
are
no
longer
coincident
the
of
which
the
breast
and
right
shoulder
are
to
be
consecrated
is
something
different
from
the
old
simple
zebah
but
precisely
for
this
reason
it
has
lost
its
former
broad
significance
the
that
is
the
place
where
the
are
to
be
offered
has
been
transformed
into
a
the
has
become
quite
independent
and
comes
everywhere
into
the
foreground
the
sacrifices
which
are
unconnected
with
a
meal
altogether
predominate
so
much
that
as
is
well
known
theophrastus
could
declare
there
were
no
others
among
the
jews
who
in
this
way
were
differentiated

example
in
the
case

in

point
it
still
bears
involuntary
testimony
to
the
old
custom
by
applying

gained
the
voluntary
private
offering
which
the
sacrificer
ate
in
a
joyful
company
at
the
holy
place
has
given
way
before
the
compulsory
of
which
he
obtains
no
share
and
from
which
the
character
of
the
sacred
meal
has
been
altogether
taken
away

it
is
true
still
continues
to
be
a
meal
if
only
a
one
of
which

alone
partakes
but
in
the
case
of
the
everything
is
kept
far
out

will
have
it
that

inducing

to
falsification
of
the

make

up
again
with
the
produce
of
the

offerings
is
either
too

dull

are
the

in
the
entire

the

way

sharply
accentuated
reproach
against

that
they
neglect
the
torah
and
encourage
the
popular
propensity
to
superstitious
and
impure
religious
service
besides
where
is
there
any
reproach
at
all
according
to
the
pentateuch
in
the
first
section
of

and
the
second
speaks
of
wnm
not
of

it
would
be
less
unreasonable
to
with
the
similarly
named
sin
and
trespass
offering
of
the
pentateuch
the
five
golden
mice
and
the
five
golden
emerods
with
which
the
philistines
send
back
the
ark
and
which
in

are
designated
or
still
better
the
sin
and
trespass
monies
which
according
to
xii
fell
to
the
share
of
the
jerusalem
priests
only
the
fact
is
that
even
in
the
second
passage
the
and
are
no
sacrifices
but
more
exactly
to
render
the
original
meaning
of
the
words
mere
fines
and
in
fact
money
fines
on
the
other
hand
the
referred
to
in

has
nothing
to
do
with
a
due
of
the
priests
but
simply
denotes
the
guilt
which
eventually
another
takes
upon
himself
even
in

a
passage
which
is
certainly
late
must
not
be
taken
in
the
technical
sense
of
the
ritual
legislation

simply
as
in

in
the
sense
of
guilt
borne
by
the
innocent
for
the
guilty
for
the
explanation
of
this
prophetic
passage
gramberg
has
rightly
had
recourse

the
narrative
of

upon
his
house

to

the
cause
of
a
three
years
famine
when
asked
how
it
can
be
taken
away
the
gibeonites
answer
it
is
not
a
matter
of
silver
and
gold
to
us
with
respect
to
saul
and
his
house
let
seven
men
of
his
family
be
delivered
to
us

we
may
hang
them
up
unto

lord
in
gibeah
of
saul
upon
the
mountain
of
the
lord
this
was
done
all
the
seven
were
hanged
and
as
offerings
occur
for
the
first
time
in
ezekiel
and
appear
not
long
before
his
day
to
have
come
into
the
place
of
the
earlier
pecuniary
fines
xii
which
perhaps
already
also
admitted
of
being
paid
in
kind
probably
in
the
seventh
century
which
seems
to
have
been
very
open
to
the
mystery
of
atonement
and
bloodshedding
and
very
fertile
in
the
introduction
of
new
religious
usages
consider
for
example
the
prevalence
of
child
sacrifice
precisely
at
this
time
the
introduction
of
incense
the
new
fashions
which
king
manasseh
brought
in
and
of
which
certainly
much
survived
that
suited
the
temper
of
the
period
and
admitted
of
being
conjoined
with
the
worship
of
jehovah
or
even
seemed
to
enhance
its
dignity
and
solemnity
the
sin
and
trespass
offerings
of
the
pentateuch
still
bear
traces
of
their
origin
in
fines
and
penalties
they
are
not
gifts
to
god
they
are
not
even
symbolical
they
are
simply
mulcts
payable
to
the
priests
partly
of
fixed
commutation
value
leviticus
apart
from
the
mechanical
burning
of
the
fat
they
have
in
common
with
the
sacrifice
only
the
shedding
of
blood
originally
a
secondary
matter
which
has
here
become
the
chief
thing
this
circumstance
is
an
additional
proof
of
our
thesis
the
ritual
of
the
simple
offering
has
three
acts
the
presentation
of
the
living
animal
before
jehovah
and
the
laying
on
of
hands
as
a
token
of
manumission
on
the
part
of
the
offerer
the
slaughtering
and
the
sprinkling
of
the
blood
on
the
altar
the
real
or
seeming
gift
of
the
sacrificial
portions
to
the
deity
and
the
meal
of
the
human
guests
in
the
case
of
the
the
meal
in
the
third
act
disappears
and
the
slaughtering
in
the
second
comes
into
prominence
as
significant
and
sacred
inasmuch
as
what
is
always
expressly
stated
it
must
take
place
in
the
presence
of
jehovah
at
the
north
side
of
the
altar
in
the
case
of
the
sin
and
trespass
offering
the
third
act
is
dropped
entirely
and
accordingly
the
whole
significance
of
the
rite
attaches
to
the
slaughtering
which
of
course
also
takes
place
before
the
altar
and
to
the
sprinkling
of
the
blood
which
has
become
peculiarly
developed
here
it
is
obvious
how
the
metamorphosis
of
the
gift
and
the
meal
into
a
bloody
atonement
advances
and
reaches
its
acme
in
this
last
sacrificial
act
this
ritual
seems
to
betray
its
novelty
even
within
the
priestly
code
itself
by
a
certain
vacillation
in
the
older
corpus
of
law
leviticus
which
has
been
taken
into
that
document
all
sacrifices
are
still
embraced
under
one
or
other
of
the
two
heads
zbx
and
lh
xvii
xxii
there
are
no
others
the
indeed
occurs
in
xix
but
as
is
recognised
only
in
a
later
addition
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
demanded
in
perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
the
here
in
the
case
of
property
unlawfully
held
is
simply
the
impost
of
a
fifth
part
of
the
value
and
not
the
sacrifice
of
a
ram
which
in
leviticus
is
required
in
addition
in
numbers
also
precisely
this
fifth
part
is
called
where
it
must
have
been
according
to
leviticus
and
numbers
and
even
apart
from
leviticus
there
is
on
this
point
no
sort
of
agreement
between
the
kernel
of
the
priestly
code
and
the
later
additions
or
novels
so
to
speak
for
one
thing
there
is
a
difference
as
to
the
ritual
of
the
most
solemn
between
exodus
leviticus
ix
on
the
one
hand
and
leviticus
iv
on
the
other
and
what
is
still
more
serious
the
never
occurs
in
the
primary
but
only
in
the
secondary
passages
leviticus
xiv
numbers
vi
xviii
in
the
latter
moreover
the
distinction
between
and
is
not
very
clear
but
only
the
intention
to
make
it
perhaps
because
in
the
old
praxis
there
actually
was
a
distinction
between
ksp
xt
wt
and
ksp
m
and
in
ezekiel
between
t
and
the
three
sections
leviticus
iv
hattath
and
asham
are
essentially
not
parts
of
one
whole
but
independent
pieces
proceeding
from
the
same
school
for
is
no
continuation
of
or
appendix
to
iv
but
a
quite
independent
treatment
of
the
same
material
with
important
differences
of
form
the
place
of
the
systematic
generality
of
chap
iv
is
here
taken
by
the
definite
individual
case
and
what
is
analogous
to
it
the
ritual
is
given
with
less
minuteness
and
the
hierarchical
subordination
of
ranks
has
no
influence
on
the
classification
of
offences
in
this
section
also
and
occur
interchangeably
as
synonymous
in
the
third
section
a
ram
as
an
is
prescribed
for
the
very
case
in
which
in
the
first
a
or
a
is
required
as
iv
the
third
section
has
indeed
in
form
greater
similarity
to
the
second
but
can
not
be
regarded
as
its
true
completion
for
this
simple
reason
that
the
latter
does
not
distiguish
between
and
if
leviticus
be
followed
simply
without
regard
being
had
to
vers
the
comes
in
only
in
the
case
of
voluntary
restitution
of
property
illegally
come
by
or
detained
more
particularly
of
the
sacred
dues
the
goods
must
be
restored
to
their
owner
augmented
by
a
fifth
part
of
their
value
and
as
an
there
must
be
added
a
ram
which
falls
to
the
sanctuary
in
num
the
state
of
the
case
is
indeed
the
same
but
the
language
employed
is
different
for
in
this
passage
it
is
the
restored
property
that
is
called
and
the
ram
is
called

the
in
the
history
of
the
sacrificial
system
was
the
reformation
of
josiah
what
we
find
in
the
priestly
code
is
the
matured
result
of
that
event
it
is
precisely
in
the
distinctions
that
are
characteristic
of
the
sacrificial
law
as
compared
with
the
ancient
sacrificial
praxis
that
we
have
evidence
of
the
fact
that
if
not
all
exactly
occasioned
by
the
centralisation
of
the
worship
they
were
almost
all
somehow
at
least
connected
with
that
change
in
the
early
days
worship
arose
out
of
the
midst
of
ordinary
life
and
was
in
most
intimate
and
manifold
connection
with
it
a
sacrifice
was
a
meal
a
fact
showing
how
remote
was
the
idea
of
antithesis
between
spiritual
earnestness
and
secular
joyousness
a
meal
unites
a
definite
circle
of
guests
and
in
this
way
the
sacrifice
brought
into
connection
the
members
of
the
family
the
associates
of
the
corporation
the
soldiers
of
the
army
and
generally
speaking
the
constituents
of
any
permanent
or
temporary
society
it
is
earthly
relationships
that
receive
their
consecration
thereby
and
in
correspondence
are
the
natural
festal
occasions
presented
by
the
vicissitudes
of
life
year
after
year
the
return
of
vintage
and
brought
together
the
members
of
the
household
to
eat
and
to
drink
in
the
presence
of
jehovah
and
besides
these
there
were
less
regularly
recurring
events
which
were
celebrated
in
one
circle
after
another
there
was
no
warlike
expedition
which
was
not
inaugurated
in
this
fashion
no
agreement
that
was
not
thus
ratified
no
important
undertaking
of
any
kind
was
gone
about
without
a
sacrifice

arrives

the

the

is
what
gives
it

the
occasion

which
accordingly
it
varies
in
manifold
ways
arising
out
of
the
exigencies
and
directed
to
the
objects
of
daily
life
the
sacrifices
reflect
in
themselves
a
correspondingly
rich
variety
our
wedding
baptismal
and
funeral
feasts
on
the
one
hand
and
our
banquets
for
all
sorts
of
occasions
on
the
other
might
still
be
adduced
as
the
most
obvious
comparison
were
it
not
that
here
too
the
divorce
between
sacred
and
secular
destroys
it
religious
worship
was
a
natural
thing
in
hebrew
antiquity
it
was
the
blossom
of
life
the
heights
and
depths
of
which
it
was
its
business
to
transfigure
and
glorify
the
law
which
abolished
all
sacrificial
seats
with
a
single
exception
severed
this
connection
deuteronomy
indeed
does
not
contemplate
such
a
result
here
in
marked
opposition
to
what
we
find
in
the
priestly
code
to
eat
and
be
merry
before
jehovah
is
the
standing
phrase
for
sacrificing
the
idea
is
that
in
concentrating
all
the
worship
towards
jerusalem
all
that
is
effected
is
a
mere
change
of
place
the
essence
of
the
thing
remaining
unaltered
this
however
was
a
mistake
to
celebrate
the
vintage
festival
among
one
native
hills
and
to
celebrate
it
at
jerusalem
were
two
very
different
things
it
was
not
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
one
could
seize
on
the
spot
any
occasion
that
casually
offered
itself
for
a
sacrificial
meal
or
whether
it
was
necessary
that
one
should
first
enter
upon
a
journey
and
it
was
not
the
same
thing
to
appear
by
oneself
at
home
before
jehovah
and
to
lose
oneself
in
a
large
congregation
at
the
common
seat
of
worship
human
life
has
its
root
in
local
environment
and
so
also
had
the
ancient
cultus
in
being
transplanted
from
its
natural
soil
it
was
deprived
of
its
natural
nourishment
a
separation
between
it
and
the
daily
life
was
inevitable
and
deuteronomy
itself
paved
the
way
for
this
result
by
permitting
profane
slaughtering
a
man
lived
in
hebron
but
sacrificed
in
jerusalem
life
and
worship
fell
apart
the
consequences
which
lie
dormant
in
the
deuteronomic
law
are
fully
developed
in
the
priestly
code
this
is
the
reason
why
the
sacrifice
combined
with
a
meal
formerly
by
far
the
chief
now
falls
completely
into
the
background
one
could
eat
flesh
at
home
but
in
jerusalem
business
was
to
do
worship
accordingly
those
sacrifices
were
preferred
in
which
the
religious
character
came
to
the
front
with
the
utmost
possible
purity
and
without
any
admixture
of
natural
elements
sacrifices
of
which
god
received
everything
and
man
nothing
and
if
formerly
the
sacrifice
had
taken
its
complexion
from
the
quality
of
the
occasion
which
led
to
it
it
now
had
essentially
but
one
uniform
purpose
to
be
a
medium
of
worship
the
warm
pulse
of
life
no
longer
throbbed
in
it
to
animate
it
it
was
no
longer
the
blossom
and
the
fruit
of
every
branch
of
life
it
had
its
own
meaning
all
to
itself
it
symbolised
worship
and
that
was
enough
the
soul
was
fled
the
shell
remained
upon
the
shaping
out
of
which
every
energy
was
now
concentrated
a
manifoldness
of
rites
took
the
place
of
individualising
occasions
technique
was
the
main
thing
and
strict
fidelity
to
rubric
once
cultus
was
spontaneous
now
it
is
a
thing
of
statute
the
satisfaction
which
it
affords
is
properly
speaking
something
which
lies
outside
of
itself
and
consists
in
the
moral
satisfaction
arising
out
of
the
conscientiousness
with
which
the
ritual
precepts
once
for
all
enjoined
by
god
on
his
people
are
fulfilled
the
freewill
offering
is
not
indeed
forbidden
but
value
in
the
strict
sense
is
attached
only
to
those
which
have
been
prescribed
and
which
accordingly
preponderate
everywhere
and
even
in
the
case
of
the
freewill
offering
everything
must
strictly
and
accurately
comply
with
the
restrictions
of
the
ordinance
if
any
one
in
the
fulness
of
his
heart
had
offered
in
a
more
pieces
of
flesh
than
the
ritual
enjoined
it
would
have
been
the
worse
for
him
of
old
the
sacrifice
combined
with
a
meal
had
established
a
special
relation
between
the
deity
and
a
definite
society
of
guests
the
natural
sacrificial
society
was
the
family
or
the
clan
i
xvi
xx
now
the
smaller
sacred
fellowships
get
lost
the
varied
groups
of
social
life
disappear
in
the
neutral
shadow
of
the
universal
congregation
or
church
dh
qhl
the
notion
of
this
last
is
foreign
to
hebrew
antiquity
but
runs
through
the
priestly
code
from
beginning
to
end
like
the
worship
itself
its
subject
also
became
abstract
a
spiritual
entity
which
could
be
kept
together
by
no
other
means
except
worship
as
now
the
participation
of
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
in
the
sacrifice
was
of
necessity
always
mainly
ideal
the
consequence
was
that
the
sacred
action
came
to
be
regarded
as
essentially
perfect
by
virtue
of
its
own
efficacy
in
being
performed
by
the
priest
even
though
no
one
was
present
hence
later
the
necessity
for
a
special
sacrificial
deputation
the
the
connection
of
all
this
with
the
judaising
tendency
to
remove
god
to
a
distance
from
man
it
may
be
added
is
clear
it
is
not
asserted
that
the
cultus
before
the
iaw
of
which
the
darker
sides
are
known
from
amos
and
hosea
was
better
than
the
legal
but
merely
that
it
was
more
original
the
standard
of
judgment
being
not
the
moral
element
but
merely
the
idea
the
primary
meaning
of
worship
nor
is
it
disputed
further
that
the
belief
in
the
dependence
of
sacrifices
and
other
sacred
acts
upon
a
laboriously
strict
compliance
with
traditional
and
prescriptive
rites
occurs
in
the
case
of
certain
peoples
even
in
the
remotest
antiquity
but
with
the
israelites
judging
by
the
testimony
of
the
historical
and
prophetical
books
this
was
not
on
the
whole
the
case
any
more
than
with
the
ancient
greeks
there
were
no
brahmans
or
magians
in
either
case
moreover
it
must
be
carefully
noted
that
not
even
in
the
priestly
code
do
we
yet
find
the
same
childish
appreciation
of
the
cultus
as
occurs
in
such
a
work
as
the
rigveda
and
that
the
strict
rules
are
not
prescribed
and
maintained
with
any
such
notion
in
view
as
that
by
their
observance
alone
can
the
taste
of
the
deity
be
pleased
the
idea
of
god
is
here
even
strikingly
remote
from
the
anthropomorphic
and
the
whole
cultus
is
nothing
more
than
an
exercise
in
piety
which
has
simply
been
enjoined
so
once
for
all
without
any
one
being
in
any
way
the
better
for
it
two
details
still
deserve
special
prominence
here
in
the
priestly
code
the
most
important
sacrifice
is
the
that
is
to
say
in
point
of
fact
the
the
consisting
of
two
yearling
lambs
which
are
daily
consumed
upon
the
altar
of
one
in
the
morning
another
in
the
evening
the
custom
of
daily
offering
a
fixed
sacrifice
at
a
definite
time
existed
indeed
in
a
simpler
form

dignity

of
the
high

the
daily
appears
to
be
older
than
the
daily
for
while
it
was
a
natural
thing
to
prepare
a
meal
regularly
for
the
deity
the
expense
of
a
daily
was
too
great
for
an
ordinary
place
of
worship
and
besides
it
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
men
to
eat
flesh
every
day
the
offering
of
the
daily
is
already
employed
in
xviii
as
a
mark
of
time
to
denote
the
afternoon
and
this
use
is
continued
down
to
the
latest
period
while
the
tamid
the
is
never
so
utilised
the
oddest
custom
of
all
however
was
doubtless
not
the
daily
but
the
offering
of
the
shewbread
which
served
the
same
purpose
but
was
not
laid
out
fresh
every
day
even
in
the
period
but
alongside
of
it
at
that
time
the
freewill
private
offerings
had
a
much
more
important
place
and
bulked
much
more
largely
in
the
law
the
is
in
point
of
fact
the
fundamental
element
of
the
worship
for
even
the
sacrifices
of
sabbaths
and
feast
days
consist
only
of
its
numerical
increase
compare
numbers
still
later
when
it
is
said
in
the
book
of
daniel
that
the
was
done
away
this
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
the
worship
was
abolished
viii
xi
xii
but
now
the
dominant
position
of
the
daily
sabbath
day
and
festival
means
that
the
sacrificial
worship
had
assumed
a
perfectly
firm
shape
which
was
independent
of
every
special
motive
and
of
all
spontaneity
and
further
what
is
closely
connected
with
this
that
it
took
place
for
the
sake
of
the
congregation
the
congregation
in
the
technical
sense
attached
to
that
word
in
the
law
hence
the
necessity
for
the
general
the
prototype
of
which
is
found
in
the
of
half
a
shekel
for
the
service
of
the
tabernacle
in
exodus
xxx
seq
prior
to
the
exile
the
regular
sacrifice
was
paid
for
by
the
kings
of
judah
and
in
ezekiel
the
monarch
still
continues
to
defray
the
expenses
not
only
of
the
sabbath
day
and
festival
sacrifices
xiv
seq
but
also
of
the
xlvi
compare
the
massoretic
text
has
corrected
the
third
person
referring
to
the
princes
into
the
second
making
it
an
address
to
the
priests
which
however
is
quite
impossible
in
ezekiel
it
is
also
a
mark
of
the
date
that
according
to
exodus
the
expenses
of
the
temple
worship
are
met
directly
out
of
the
levied
from
the
community
which
can
only
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
at
that
time
there
had
ceased
to
be
any
sovereign
so
completely
was
the
sacrifice
the
affair
of
the
community
in
judaism
that
the
voluntary
of
the
individual
became
metamorphosed
into
a
money
payment
as
a
contribution
to
the
cost
of
the
public
worship
mark

matthew

the
second
point
is
this
just
as
the
special
purposes
and
occasions
of
sacrifice
fall
out
of
sight
there
comes
into
increasing
prominence
the
one
uniform
and
universal
occasion
that
of
sin
and
one
uniform
and
universal
purpose
that
of
propitiation
in
the
priestly
code
the
peculiar
mystery
in
the
case
of
all
animal
sacrifices
is
atonement
by
blood
this
appears
in
its
purest
development
in
the
case
of
the
sin
and
trespass
offerings
which
are
offered
as
well
for
individuals
as
for
the
congregation
and
for
its
head
in
a
certain
sense
the
great
day
of
atonement
is
the
culmination
of
the
whole
religious
and
sacrificial
service
to
which
amid
all
diversities
of
ritual
continuously
underlying
reference
to
sin
is
common
throughout
of
this
feature
the
ancient
sacrifices
present
few
traces
it
was
indeed
sought
at
a
very
early
period
to
influence
the
doubtful
or
threatening
mood
of
deity
and
make
his
countenance
gracious
by
means
of
rich
gifts
but
the
gift
had
as
was
natural
then
the
character
of
a
tentative
effort
only
micah

there
was
no
such
thought
as
that
a
definite
guilt
must
and
could
be
taken
away
by
means
of
a
prescribed
offering
when
the
law
discriminates
between
such
sins
as
are
covered
by
an
offering
and
such
sins
as
relentlessly
are
visited
with
wrath
it
makes
a
distinction
very
remote
from
the
antique
to
hebrew
antiquity
the
wrath
of
god
was
something
quite
incalculable
its
causes
were
never
known
much
less
was
it
possible
to
enumerate
beforehand
those
sins
which
kindled
it
and
those
which
did
not
when
the
wrath
is
regulated
by
the
conditions
of
the
covenant
the
original
notion
which
scorns
the
thought
of
adjustment
is
completely
changed
what
gave
the
thing
its
mysterious
awfulness
was
precisely
this
that
in
no
way
was
it
possible
to
guard
against
it
and
that
nothing
could
avail
to
counteract
it
under
the
pressure
of
jehovah
wrath
not
only
was
sacrifice
abandoned
but
even
the
mention
of
his
name
was
shunned
so
as
to
avoid
attracting
his
attention
hos

an
underlying
reference
of
sacrifice
to
sin
speaking
generally
was
entirely
absent
the
ancient
offerings
were
wholly
of
a
joyous
nature

merrymaking

in

ver
as
regards
the
essential
nature
of
the
two
feasts
these
passages
are
at
one
the
of
deuteronomy
and
the
of
the
jehovistic
legislation
do
not
coincide
in
time
merely
but
are
in
fact
one
and
the
same
feast
the
autumnal
ingathering
of
the
wine
and
of
the
oil
from
the
vat
and
press
and
of
the
corn
from
the
the
name
refers
immediately
to
the
vintage
and
to
which
the
word
seems
also
to
relate
being
most
easily
explained
from
the
custom
of
the
whole
household
old
and
young
going
out
to
the
vineyard
in
time
of
harvest
and
there
camping
out
in
the
open
air
under
the
improvised
shelter
of
booths
made
with
branches
isaiah
i
and
in
like
manner
are
only
different
names
for
the
same
reality
namely
for
the
feast
of
the
or
more
strictly
the
which
takes
place
in
the
beginning
of
summer
thus
both
festivals
have
a
purely
natural
occasion
on
the
other
hand
the
spring
festival
which
always
opens
the
series
has
a
historical
motive
assigned
to
it
the
exodus
most
expressly
in
deuteronomy
being
given
as
the
event
on
which
it
rests
the
cycle
nevertheless
seems
to
presuppose
and
to
require
the
original
homogeneity
of
all
its
members
now
the
twofold
ritual
of
the
and
the
maccoth
points
to
a
twofold
character
of
the
feast
the
properly
so
named
is
called
not
but
hag
the
original
form
of
the
expression
of
exodus
xxxiv
has
been
preserved
in
exodus
xxiii
xggy
not
xg
hpsx
in
deuteronomy
although
psx
is
more
prominent
it
is
called
xg
hmcwt
in
xvi
and
it
is
only
the
latter
that
is
with
the
other
two
the
name
indeed
does
not
occur
at
all
until
deuteronomy
although
in
the
law
of
the
two
tables
the
sacrifice
of
the
seems
to
be
brought
into
connection
with
the
feast
of
unleavened
bread
it
follows
that
only
the
can
be
taken
into
account
for
purposes
of
comparison
with
and
as
to
the
proper
significance
of
the
jehovistic
legislation
does
not
find
it
needful
to
instruct
its
contemporaries
but
it
is
incidentally
disclosed
in
deuteronomy
there
the
festival
of
harvest
is
brought
into
a
definite
relation
in
point
of
time
with
that
of
it
is
to
be
celebrated
seven
weeks
later
this
is
no
new
ordinance
but
one
that
rests
upon
old
custom
for
the
name
feast
of
weeks
occurs
in
a
passage
so
early
as
exodus
xxxiv
comp
jeremiah
now
seven
weeks
after
easter
deuteronomy
xvi
is
further
explained
with
greater
elaborateness
as
meaning
seven
weeks
after
the
putting
of
the
sickle
to
the
corn
thus
the
festival
of
is
equivalent
to
that
of
the
putting
of
the
sickle
to
the
corn
and
thereby
light
is
thrown
on
its
fixed
relation
to
pentecost
pentecost
celebrates
the
close
of
the
reaping
which
commences
with
barley
harvest
and
ends
with
that
of
wheat
easter
its
beginning
in
the
month
of
corn
ears
and
between
the
two
extends
the
duration
of
harvest
time
computed
at
seven
weeks
the
whole
of
this
is
a
great
festal
season
rounded
off
by
the
two
festivals
we
gain
further
light
from
leviticus
xxiii
against
this
there
is
of
course
possible
the
objection
that
the
passage
at
present
forms
part
of
the
priestly
code
but
the
collection
of
laws
embraced
in
leviticus
it
is
well
known
has
merely
been
redacted
and
incorporated
by
the
author
of
the
priestly
code
and
originally
was
an
independent
corpus
marking
the
transition
from
deuteronomy
to
the
priestly
code
sometimes
approximating
more
to
the
one
and
at
other
times
to
the
other
and
the
use
of
leviticus
xxiii
in
this
connection
is
completely
justified
by
the
consideration
that
only
in
this
way
do
the
rites
it
describes
find
meaning
and
vitality
the
easter
point
is
here
as
in
deuteronomy
fixed
as
being
the
beginning
of
harvest
but
is
still
more
definitely
determined
as
the
day
after
the
first
sabbath
falling
within
harvest
time
and
pentecost
follows
the
same
reckoning
and
the
special
easter
ritual
consists
in
the
offering
of
a
barley
sheaf
before
this
it
is
not
lawful
to
taste
of
the
new
crop
and
the
corresponding
pentecostal
rite
is
the
offering
of
ordinary
wheaten
loaves
the
corn
harvest
begins
with
barley
and
ends
with
wheat
at
the
beginning
the
are
presented
in
their
crude
state
as
a
sheaf
just
as
men
in
like
manner
partake
of
the
new
growth
in
the
form
of
parched
ears
leviticus
xxiii
josh
at
the
end
they
are
prepared
in
the
form
of
common
bread
thus
the
now
begin
to
be
intelligible
as
has
been
already
said
see
they
are
not
strictly
speaking
duly
prepared
loaves
but
the
bread
that
is
hurriedly
baked
to
meet
a
pressing
emergency
xxviii
thus
they
are
quite
correctly
associated
with
the
haste
of
the
exodus
and
described
as
bread
of
affliction
at
first
people
do
not
take
time
in
a
leisurely
way
to
leaven
knead
and
bake
the
year
new
bread
but
a
hasty
cake
is
prepared
in
the
ashes
this
is
what
is
meant
by
maccoth
they
are
contrasted
with
the
pentecostal
loaves
precisely
as
are
the
sheaf
and
the
parched
ears
which
last
according
to
josh
may
be
eaten
in
their
stead
and
without
a
doubt
they
were
originally
not
the
easter
food
of
men
merely
but
also
of
the
deity
so
that
the
sheaf
comes
under
the
category
of
the
later
spiritual
refinements
of
sacrificial
material
easter
then
is
the
opening
as
pentecost
is
the
closing
festivity
or
what
means
the
same
thing
of
the
seven
haneberg
alterhuemer
in
deuteronomy
pentecost
as
lasts
for
only
one
day
while
easter
and
the
feast
of
tabernacles
each
ast
a
week
weeks
joy
of
harvest
and
the
spring
festival
no
longer
puzzles
us
by
the
place
it
holds
in
the
cycle
of
the
three
yearly
festivities
but
what
is
the
state
of
the
case
as
regards
the
the
meaning
of
the
name
is
not
clear
as
we
have
seen
the
word
first
occurs
in
deuteronomy
and
there
also
the
time
of
the
celebration
is
restricted
to
the
evening
and
night
of
the
first
day
of
from
sunset
until
the
following
morning
in
point
of
fact
the
points
back
to
the
sacrifice
of
the
firstlings
exodus
xxxiv
xiii
seq
deuteronomy
xv
xvi
seq
and
it
is
principally
upon
this
that
the
historical
character
of
the
whole
festivity
hinges
it
is
because
jehovah
smote
the
of
egypt
and
spared
those
of
israel
that
the
latter
thenceforward
are
held
sacred
to
him
such
is
the
representation
given
not
merely
in
the
priestly
code
but
also
in
exodus
xiii
seq
but
in
neither
of
its
sources
does
the
jehovistic
tradition
know
anything
of
this
let
my
people
go
that
they
may
keep
a
feast
unto
me
in
the
wilderness
with
sacrifices
and
cattle
and
sheep
this
from
the
first
is
the
demand
made
upon
pharaoh
and
it
is
in
order
to
be
suitably
adorned
for
this
purpose
contemplated
by
them
from
the
first
that
the
departing
israelites
borrow
festal
robes
and
ornaments
from
the
egyptians
because
pharaoh
refuses
to
allow
the
hebrews
to
offer
to
their
god
the
firstlings
of
cattle
that
are
his
due
jebovah
seizes
from
him
the
of
men
thus
the
exodus
is
not
the
occasion
of
the
festival
but
the
festival
the
occasion
if
only
a
pretended
one
of
the
exodus
if
this
relationship
is
inverted
in
exodus
xiii
it
is
because
that
passage
is
not
one
of
the
sources
of
the
jehovistic
tradition
but
is
part
of
the
redaction
and
in
fact
as
is
plain
from
other
reasons
with
regard
to
the
entire
section
xiii
of
a
deuteronomic
redaction
from
this
it
follows
that
the
elaboration
of
the
historical
motive
of
the
passover
is
not
earlier
than
deuteronomy
although
perhaps
a
certain
inclination
to
that
way
of
explaining
it
appears
before
then
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
exodus
xii
what
has
led
to
it
is
evidently
the
coincidence
of
the
spring
festival
with
the
exodus
already
accepted
by
the
older
tradition
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
having
become
inverted
in
course
of
time
the
only
view
sanctioned
by
the
nature
of
the
case
is
that
the
israelite
custom
of
offering
the
firstlings
gave
rise
to
the
narrative
of
the
slaying
of
the
of
egypt
unless
the
custom
be
the
story
is
inexplicable
and
the
peculiar
selection
of
its
victims
by
the
plague
is
left
without
a
motive
the
sacrifice
of
the
of
the
male
that
is
to
say
for
the
females
were
reared
as
with
us
does
not
require
an
historical
explanation
but
can
be
accounted
for
very
simply
it
is
the
expression
of
thankfulness
to
the
deity
for
fruitful
flocks
and
herds
if
claim
is
also
laid
to
the
human
this
is
merely
a
later
generalisation
which
after
all
resolves
itself
merely
into
a
substitution
of
an
animal
offering
and
an
extension
of
the
original
sacrifice
in
exodus
xx
and
xxxiv
this
consequence
does
not
yet
seem
to
be
deduced
or
even
to
be
suspected
as
possible
it
first
appears
in
xxxiv
and
presents
itself
most
distinctly
in
the
latest
passage
xiii
for
there
rxm
is
contrasted
with
gr
and
for
the
first
the
expression
h
byr
a
technical
one
in
the
time
of
jeremiah
and
ezekiel
for
child
sacrifice
is
used
the
view
of
some
scholars
most
of
them
mere
casual
visitors
in
the
field
of
old
testament
research
that
the
slaying
of
the
male
children
was
originally
precisely
the
main
feature
of
the
passover
hardly
deserves
refutation
like
the
other
festivals
this
also
apart
from
the
view
taken
of
it
in
the
priestly
code
has
a
thoroughly
joyous
character
exodus
x
deuteronomy
xvi
comp
isaiah
xxx
there
are
some
historical
instances
indeed
of
the
surrender
of
an
only
child
or
of
the
dearest
one
but
always
as
a
voluntary
and
quite
exceptional
act
the
contrary
is
not
proved
by
hosea
xiii
the
offering
of
they
make
them
molten
images
of
their
silver
idols
according
to
their
fancy
to
them
they
speak
men
doing
sacrifice
kiss
calves
the
prophet
would
hardly
blame
human
sacrifices
only
thus
incidentally
more
in
ridicule
than
in
high
moral
indignation
he
would
bring
it
to
prominence
the
horrible
and
revolting
character
of
the
action
much
more
than
its
absurdity
thus
zbxy
dm
means
most
probably
offerers
belonging
to
the
human
race
at
the
same
time
even
if
the
expression
did
mean
sacrificers
of
men
it
would
prove
nothing
regarding
regular
sacrifices
of
children
human
was
certainly
no
regular
or
commanded
exaction
in
ancient
times
there
are
no
traces
of
so
enormous
a
blood
tax
but
on
the
contrary
many
of
a
great
preference
for
eldest
sons
it
was
not
until
shortly
before
the
exile
that
the
burning
of
children
was
introduced
on
a
grand
scale
along
with
many
other
innovations
and
supported
by
a
strict
interpretation
of
the
command
regarding
firstlings
jeremiah
vii
xix
ezekiel
xx
in
harmony
with
this
is
the
fact
that
the
law
of
exodus
xiii
comes
from
the
hand
of
the
latest
redactor
of
the
jehovistic
history
abel
was
a
shepherd
and
cain
was
a
husbandman
and
in
process
of
time
it
came
to
pass
that
cain
brought
of
the
fruit
of
the
ground
an
offering
unto
the
lord
and
abel
also
brought
an
offering
of
the
firstlings
of
his
sheep
it
is
out
of
the
simplest
most
natural
and
most
offerings
those
of
the
of
the
flock
herd
and
field
the
occasions
for
which
recur
regularly
with
the
seasons
of
the
year
that
the
annual
festivals
took
their
rise
the
passover
corresponds
with
the
firstlings
of
abel
the
shepherd
the
other
three
with
the
fruits
presented
by
cain
the
husbandman
apart
from
this
difference
in
essence
and
foundation
they
are
all
precisely
alike
their
connection
with
the
of
the
firstlings
for
sacrifice
or
offering
yearly
seasons
is
indeed
assumed
rather
than
expressly
stated
in
the
jehovistic
and
deuteronomistic
legislation
yet
in
exodus
xxiii
xxxiv
we
read
three
times
in
the
year
shall
all
thy
men
appear
before
the
lord
jehovah
thou
shalt
not
mingle
the
blood
of
my
sacrifice
with
leaven
neither
shall
the
fat
of
my
sacrifice
remain
until
the
morning
the
best
of
the
of
thy
land
shalt
thou
bring
into
the
house
of
jehovah
thy
god
thou
shalt
not
seethe
the
kid
in
the
milk
of
its
mother
it
is
forbidden
to
appear
before
jehovah
empty
hence
the
connection
between
the
first
general
sentence
and
the
details
which
follow
it
of
these
the
first
seems
to
relate
to
the
passover
doubtless
indeed
it
holds
good
of
all
animal
sacrifices
but
in
point
of
fact
these
are
offered
in
preponderating
numbers
at
the
great
festival
after
the
herds
and
flocks
have
produced
their
young
the
remaining
sentences
relate
to
the
feasts
of
harvest
and
ingathering
whose
connection
with
the
fruits
of
the
field
is
otherwise
clear
as
for
deuteronomy
there
also
it
is
required
on
the
one
hand
that
the
dues
from
the
flock
and
herd
and
field
shall
be
personally
offered
at
jerusalem
and
made
the
occasion
of
joyous
sacrificial
feasts
on
the
other
hand
that
three
appearances
in
the
year
shall
be
made
at
jerusalem
at
easter
at
pentecost
and
at
the
feast
of
tabernacles
and
not
with
empty
hands
these
requirements
can
only
be
explained
on
the
assumption
that
the
material
of
the
feasts
was
that
furnished
by
the
dues
clearly
in
deuteronomy
all
three
coincide
sacrifices
dues
feasts
other
sacrifices
than
those
occasioned
by
the
dues
can
hardly
be
thought
of
for
the
purpose
of
holding
a
joyous
festival
before
jehovah
the
dues
are
properly
speaking
simply
those
sacrifices
prescribed
by
popular
custom
and
therefore
fixed
and
festal
of
which
alone
the
law
has
occasion
to
treat
deuteronomy

in
the
section

dues
and
feasts
are
taken
together
in
the
first
half

there
is
a
progression
from
those
acts
which
are
repeated
within
the
course
of
a
year
to
those
which
occur
every
three
years
and
finally
to
those
which
occur
every

in
the
second
half

recurrence
is
again
made
to
the
principal
that
is
the
seasonal
dues
first
to
the
firstlings
and
the
passover
feast
and
afterwards
to
the
two
others
in
connection
with
which
the
tithes
of
the
fruits
are
offered
it
results
from
the
very
nature
of
the
case
that
the
people
come
together
to
offer
thanks
for
jehovah
blessing
but
no
special
emphasis
is
laid
upon
this
in
the
jehovistic
legislation
exodus

the
terms
have
not
yet
come
to
be
fixed
so
that
it
is
hardly
possible
to
speak
of
a
dies
festus
in
the
strict
sense
festal
seasons
rather
than
festal
days
are
what
we
have
easter
is
celebrated
in
the
month
abib
when
the
corn
is
in
the
ear
exodus
ix
pentecost
when
the
wheat
is
cut
the
autumn
festival
when
the
vintage
has
been
completed
rather
vague
and
shifting
determinations
deuteronomy
advances
a
step
towards
fixing
the
terms
and
intervals
more
accurately
a
circumstance
very
intimately
connected
with
the
centralisation
of
the
worship
in
jerusalem
even
here
however
we
do
not
meet
with
one
general
festive
offering
on
the
part
of
the
community
but
only
with
isolated
private
offerings
by
individuals
in
correspondence
with
this
the
amount
of
the
gifts
is
left
with
considerable
vagueness
to
the
of
the
offerers
only
the
firstlings
are
definitely
demanded
the
redemption
allowed
in
deuteronomy
by
means
of
money
which
buys
a
substitute
in
jerusalem
has
no
proper
meaning
for
the
earlier
time
yet
even
then
the
offerer
may
in
individual
instances
have
availed
himself
of
liberty
of
exchange
all
the
more
because
even
then
his
gift
as
a
sacrificial
meal
was
essentially
a
benefit
to
himself
exodus
xxiii
genesis

y
hn
for
the
of
the
field
exodus
prescribes
no
measure
at
all
deuteromony
demands
the
tithe
of
corn
wine
and
oil
which
however
is
not
to
be
understood
with
mathematical
strictness
inasmuch
as
it
is
used
at
sacrificial
meals
is
not
made
over
to
a
second
party
and
thus
does
not
require
to
be
accounted
for
the
tithe
as
appears
from
deuteronomy
is
offered
in
autumn
that
is
at
the
feast
of
tabernacles
this
is
the
proper
autumn
festival
of
thanksgiving
not
only
for
the
wine
harvest
but
also
for
that
of
the
xvi
it
demands
seven
days
which
must
all
be
spent
in
jerusalem
while
in
the
case
of
maccoth
only
one
need
be
spent
there
it
is
that
there
is
no
restriction
to
the
use
of
vegetable
gifts
merely
but
sacrifices
of
flesh
are
also
assumed
purchased
perhaps
with
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
the
tithe
in
this
way
the
special
character
of
the
feasts
and
their
connection
with
the
peculiar
to
them
could
easily
disappear
a
thing
which
seems
actually
to
have
occurred
in
deuteronomy
and
perhaps
even
earlier
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
much
should
seem
unclear
to
us
which
must
have
been
obvious
to
contemporaries
in
deuteronomy
moreover
almost
everything
is
left
to
standing
custom
and
only
the
one
main
point
insisted
on
that
the
religious
worship
and
thus
also
the
festivals
must
be
celebrated
only
in
jerusalem
leaving
out
of
account
the
passover
which
originally
had
an
independent
standing
and
only
afterwards
through
its
connection
with
maccoth
was
taken
into
the
regular
cycle
of
the
it
can
not
be
doubted
generally
speaking
and
on
the
whole
that
not
only
in
the
jehovistic
but
also
in
the
deuteronomic
legislation
the
festivals
rest
upon
agriculture
the
basis
at
once
of
life
and
of
religion
the
soil
the
fruitful
soil
is
the
object
of
religion
it
takes
the
place
alike
of
heaven
and
of
hell
jehovah
gives
the
land
and
its
produce
he
receives
the
best
of
what
it
yields
as
an
expression
of
thankfulness
the
tithes
in
recognition
of
his
seigniorial
right
the
relation
between
himself
and
his
people
first
arose
from
his
having
given
them
the
land
in
fee
it
continues
to
be
maintained
inasmuch
as
good
weather
and
fertility
come
from
him
it
is
in
deuteronomy
that
one
detects
the
first
very
perceptible
traces
of
a
historical
dress
being
given
to
the
religion
and
the
worship
but
this
process
is
still
confined
within
modest
limits
the
historical
event
to
which
recurrence
is
always
made
is
the
bringing
up
of
israel
out
of
egypt
and
this
is
significant
in
so
far
as
the
bringing
up
out
of
egypt
coincides
with
the
leading
into
canaan
that
is
with
the
giving
of
the
land
so
that
the
historical
motive
again
resolves
itself
into
the
natural
in
this
way
it
can
be
said
that
not
merely
the
easter
festival
but
all
festivals
are
dependent
upon
the
introduction
of
israel
into
canaan
and
this
is
what
we
actually
find
very
clearly
in
the
prayer
deuteronomy
xxvi
with
which
at
the
feast
of
tabernacles
the
share
of
the
festal
gifts
falling
to
the
priest
is
offered
to
the
deity
a
basket
containing
fruits
is
laid
upon
the
altar
and
the
following
words
are
spoken
a
wandering
aramaean
was
my
father
and
he
went
down
into
egypt
and
sojourned
there
a
few
men
strong
and
became
there
a
nation
great
mighty
and
populous
and
the
egyptians
them
and
oppressed
them
and
laid
upon
them
hard
bondage
then
called
we
upon
ehovah
the
god
of
our
fathers
and
he
heard
our
voice
and
looked
on
our
affliction
and
our
labour
and
our
oppression
and
jehovah
brought
us
forth
out
of
egypt
with
a
mighty
hand

observe
here
how
the
act
of
salvation
whereby
israel
was
founded
issues
in
the
gift
of
a
fruitful
land
with
this
account
of
the
legislation
harmonises
the
practice
so
far
as
that
can
be
traced
or
is
borne
witness
to
in
the
historical
and
prophetical
books
ancient
festivals
in
israel
must
have
had
the
pastoral
life
as
their
basis
only
the
passover
therefore
can
be
regarded
as
belonging
to
the
number
of
these
it
is
the
ancient
arabs
also
observed
the
sacrifice
of
the
firstlings

a
solemnity

originally
fell

a
festivity
mentioned
among
the
earliest
and
that
for
pastoral
judah
is
the
xxv
seq
genesis
xxxviii
but
it
does
not
appear
to
have
ever
developed
into
a
regular
and
independent
festival
of
wool
and
flax
are
mentioned
in
hosea
ii
as
of
wool
alone
in
deuteronomy
xviii
with
perfect
accuracy
accordingly
that
precisely
the
passover
is
postulated
as
having
been
the
occasion
of
the
exodus
as
being
a
sacrificial
feast
that
has
to
be
celebrated
in
the
wilderness
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
agriculture
or
harvest
but
it
is
curious
to
notice
how
little
prominence
is
afterwards
given
to
this
festival
which
from
the
nature
of
the
case
is
the
oldest
of
all
it
can
not
have
been
known
at
all
to
the
book
of
the
covenant
for
there
exodus
xxii
the
command
is
to
leave
the
firstling
seven
days
with
its
dam
and
on
the
eighth
day
to
give
it
to
jehovah
probably
through
the
predominance
gained
by
agriculture
and
the
feasts
founded
on
it
the
passover
fell
into
disuse
in
many
parts
of
israel
and
kept
its
ground
only
in
districts
where
the
pastoral
and
wilderness
life
still
retained
its
importance
this
would
also
explain
why
the
passover
first
comes
clearly
into
light
when
judah
alone
survives
after
the
fall
of
samaria
in
xxiii
seq
we
are
told
that
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
king
josiah
the
passover
was
held
according
to
the
precept
of
the
law
deut
xvi
and
that
for
the
first
time
never
until
then
from
the
days
of
the
judges
had
it
been
so
observed
if
in
this
passage
the
novelty
of
the
institution
is
so
strongly
insisted
on
the
reference
is
less
to
the
essence
of
the
thing
than
to
the
manner
of
celebration
as
enjoined
in
deuteronomy
agriculture
was
learned
by
the
hebrews
from
the
canaanites
in
whose
land
they
settled
and
in
commingling
with
whom
they
during
the
period
of
the
judges
made
the
transition
to
a
sedentary
life
before
the
metamorphosis
of
shepherds
into
peasants
was
effected
they
could
not
possibly
have
had
feasts
which
related
to
agriculture
it
would
have
been
very
strange
if
they
had
not
taken
them
also
over
from
the
canaanites
the
latter
owed
the
land
and
its
fruits
to
baal
and
for
this
they
paid
him
the
due
tribute
the
israelites
stood
in
the
same
relation
to
jehovah
materially
and
in
itself
the
act
was
neither
heathenish
nor
israelite
its
character
either
way
was
determined
by
its
destination
there
was
therefore
nothing
against
a
transference
of
the
feasts
from
baal
to
jehovah
on
the
contrary
the
transference
was
a
profession
of
faith
that
the
land
and
its
produce
and
thus
all
that
lay
at
the
foundations
of
the
national
existence
were
due
not
to
the
heathen
deity
but
to
the
god
of
israel
the
earliest
testimony
is
that
which
we
have
to
the
existence
of
the
vintage
festival
in
autumn
in
the
first
instance
as
a
custom
of
the
canaanite
population
of
shechem
in
the
old
and
instructive
story
of
abimelech
the
son
of
jerubbaal
we
are
told
judges
ix
of
the
citizens
of
shechem
that
they
went
out
into
the
fields
and
gathered
their
vineyards
and
trode
the
grapes
and
celebrated
and
went
into
the
house
of
their
god
and
ate
and
drank
and
cursed
abimelech
but
this
festival
must
also
have
taken
root
among
the
israelites
at
a
tolerably
early
period
according
to
judges
xxi
seq
there
was
observed
yearly
at
shiloh
in
the
vineyards
a
feast
to
jehovah
at
which
the
maidens
went
out
to
dance
even
if
the
narrative
of
judges
xix
seq
be
as
a
whole
untrustworthy
as
history
this
does
not
apply
to
the
casual
trait
just
mentioned
especially
as
it
is
confirmed
by
i
in
this
passage
a
feast
at
shiloh
is
also
spoken
of
as
occurring
at
the
end
of
the
year
that
is
in
autumn
at
the
time
of
the
and
as
being
an
attraction
to

from

obviously
the
feast
does
not
occur
in
all
places
at
once
but
at
certain
definite
places
in
ephraim
which
then
influence
the
surrounding
district
the
thing
is
connected
with
the
origin
of
larger
sanctuaries
towards
the
end
of
the
period
of
the
judges
or
more
properly
speaking
with
their
being
taken
over
from
the
previous
inhabitants
thus
for
example
on
shechem
becoming
an
israelite
town
the
were
no
more
abolished
than
was
the
sanctuary
itself
over
and
above
this
the
erection
of
great
royal
temples
must
have
exerted
an
important
influence
alike
at
jerusalem
and
at
bethel
the
feast
was
celebrated
from
the
days
of
solomon
and
jeroboam
just
as
previously
at
shechem
and
shiloh
in
the
former

somewhat
later

be
owned
far
from

is
difficult
to
harmonise
with

if
the
interpretation
of
bul
and
ethanim
is
correct
this
was
at
that
period
the
sole
actual
national
festivall
the
feasts
at
the
beginning
of
summer
may
indeed
also
have
been
observed
at
this
early
period
isa
ix
but
in
smaller
local
circles
this
distinction
is
still
discernible
in
deuteronomy
for
although
in
that
book
the
feast
of
tabernacles
is
not
theoretically
higher
than
the
others
in
point
of
fact
it
alone
is
observed
from
beginning
to
end
at
the
central
sanctuary
while
easter
on
the
other
hand
is
for
the
most
part
kept
at
home
being
only
during
the
first
day
observed
at
jerusalem
moreover
the
smaller
demand
is
much
more
emphatically
insisted
on
than
the
larger
so
that
the
first
seems
to
have
been
an
innovation
the
latter
to
have
had
the
sanction
of
older
custom
amos
and
hosea
presupposing
as
they
do
a
splendid
cultus
and
great
sanctuaries
doubtless
also
knew
of
a
variety
of
festivals
but
they
have
no
occasion
to
mention
any
one
by
name
more
definite
notices
occur
in
isaiah
the
threatening
that
within
a
year
time
the
assyrians
will
be
in
the
land
is
thus
xxix
given
add
ye
year
to
year
let
the
feasts
come
round
yet
i
will
distress
jerusalem
and
at
the
close
of
the
same
discourse
the
prophet
expresses
himself
as
follows
xxxii
seq
rise
up
ye
women
that
are
at
ease
hear
my
voice
ye
careless
daughters
give
ear
unto
my
speech
days
upon
a
year
shall
ye
be
troubled
ye
careless
women
for
the
vintage
shall
fail
the
ingathering
shall
not
come
ye
shall
smite
upon
the
breasts
for
the
pleasant
fields
for
the
fruitful
vine
when
the
two
passages
are
taken
together
we
gather
that
isaiah
following
the
universal
custom
of
the
prophets
in
coming
forward
at
great
popular
gatherings
is
here
speaking
at
the
time
of
the
autumn
festival
in
which
the
women
also
took
an
active
part
judges
xxi
but
this
autumn
festival
the
joyous
and
natural
character
of
which
is
unmistakably
revealed
takes
place
with
him
at
the
change
of
the
year
as
may
be
inferred
from
a
comparison
between
the
ynqpw
of
xxix
i
and
the
tqpt
of
exodus
xxxiv
i
and
closes
a
cycle
of
festivals
here
for
the
first
time
indicated
the
preceding
survey
it
must
be
admitted
scarcely
seems
fully
to
establish
the
alleged
agreement
between
the
jehovistic
law
and
the
older
praxis
names
are
nowhere
to
be
found
and
in
point
of
fact
it
is
only
the
autumn
festival
that
is
well
attested
and
this
it
would
appear
as
the
only
festival
as
the
feast
and
doubtless
it
was
also
the
oldest
and
most
important
of
the
harvest
festivals
as
it
never
ceased
to
be
the
concluding
solemnity
of
the
year
what
has
been
prosperously
brought
to
close
is
what
people
celebrate
most
rightly
the
conclusion
of
the
ingathering
both
of
the
threshing
and
of
the
vintage
is
the
most
appropriate
of
all
occasions
for
a
great
joint
festival
for
this
additional
reason
that
the
term
is
fixed
not
as
in
the
case
of
the
joy
of
reaping
by
nature
alone
but
is
in
man
hands
and
can
be
regulated
by
him
yet
even
under
the
older
monarchy
the
previous
festivals
must
also
have
already
existed
as
well
isaiah
xxix
the
peculiarity
of
the
feast
of
tabernacles
would
then
reduce
itself
to
this
that
it
was
the
only
general
festival
at
jerusalem
and
bethel
local
celebrations
at
all
threshing
floors
on
all
high
places
are
not
thereby
excluded
host
ix
but
the
jehovistic
legislation
makes
no
distinction
of
local
and
central
for
it
ignores
the
great
temples
throughout
possibly
exodus
xx
looks
almost
like
a
protest
against
the
arrangements
of
the
temple
of
solomon
especially
ver
also
it
to
some
extent
systematises
the
hitherto
somewhat
vaguer
custom
the
transition
from
the
to
a
feast
was
perhaps
in
practice
still
somewhat
incomplete
in
the
paucity
of
positive
data
one
is
justified
however
in
speaking
of
a
substantial
agreement
inasmuch
as
in
the
two
cases
the
idea
of
the
festivals
is
the
same
very
instructive
in
this
respect
are
two
sections
of
hosea
chaps
ii
and
ix
which
on
this
account
deserve
to
be
fully
gone
into
in
the
first
of
these
israel
is
figured
as
a
woman
who
receives
her
maintenance
from
her
husband
that
is
from
the
deity
this
is
the
basis
of
the
covenant
relationship
but
she
falls
into
error
as
to
the
giver
of
her
meat
and
drink
and
clothing
supposing
them
to
come
from
the
idols
and
not
from
jehovah
she
hath
said
i
will
go
after
my
lovers
who
give
me
my
bread
and
my
water
my
wool
and
my
flax
mine
oil
and
my
drink
doth
she
then
not
know
that
it
is
i
jehovah
who
have
given
her
the
corn
and
the
wine
and
the
oil
and
silver
in
abundance
and
gold
out
of
which
she
maketh
false
gods
therefore
will
i
take
back
again
my
corn
in
its
time
and
my
wine
in
its
season
and
i
will
take
away
my
wool
and
my
flax
that
should
cover
her
nakedness
and
now
will
i
discover
her
shame
before
the
eyes
of
her
lovers
and
none
shall
deliver
her
out
of
my
hand
and
i
will
bring
all
her
mirth
to
an
end
her
festival
days
her
new
moons
and
her
sabbaths
and
all
her
solemn
feasts
and
i
will
destroy
her
vines
and
her
whereof
she
saith
are
my
hire
that
my
lovers
have
given
me
and
i
will
make
them
a
wilderness
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
shall
eat
them
thus
will
i
visit
upon
her
the
days
of
the
false
gods
wherein
she
burnt
fat
offerings
to
them
and
decked
herself
with
her
rings
and
her
jewels
and
went
after
her
lovers
and
forget
me
saith
the
lord
therefore
behold
i
will
allure
her
and
bring
her
into
the
wilderness
and
there
i
will
assign
her
her
vineyards
then
shall
she
be
docile
as
in
her
youth
and
as
in
the
day
when
she
came
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
thereafter
i
betroth
thee
unto
me
anew
for
ever
in
righteousness
and
in
judgment
in
loving
kindness
and
in
mercies
in
that
day
saith
the
lord
will
i
answer
the
heavens
and
they
shall
answer
the
earth
and
the
earth
shall
answer
the
corn
and
the
wine
and
the
oil
and
these
shall
answer

ii
the
blessing
of
the
land
is
here
the
end
of

of

that
are
left

are
independent
of

another
punishment
is
threatened
if
they
do
not
come
to
keep
the
feast
of
tabernacles
it
has
for
its
basis
no
historical
acts
of
salvation
but
nature
simply
which
however
is
regarded
only
as
domain
and
as
man
field
of
labour
and
is
in
no
manner
itself
deified
the

is
jehovah
house

wherein
he
lodges
and
entertains
the
nation
in
the
land
and
through
the
land
it
is
that
israel
first
becomes
the
people
of
jehovah
just
as
a
marriage
is
constituted
by
the
wife
reception
into
the
house
of
the
husband
and
her
maintenance
there
and
as
divorce
consists
in
the
wife
dismissal
from
the
house
so
is
relation
to
his
people
dissolved
by
his
making
the
land
into
a
wilderness
or
as
in
the
last
resort
by
his
actually
driving
them
forth
into
the
wilderness
he
restores
it
again
by
sowing
the
nation
into
the
land
anew
causing
the
heavens
to
give
rain
and
the
earth
to
bear
and
thereby
bringing
into
honour
the
name
of
god
sown
for
israel
ii
in
accordance
with
worship
consists
simply
of
the
thanksgiving
due
for
the
gifts
of
the
soil
the
vassalage
payable
to
the
superior
who
has
given
the
land
and
its
fruits
it
ceases
when
the
corn
and
wine
cease
in
the
wilderness
it
can
not
be
thought
of
for
if
god
bestows
nothing
then
man
can
not
rejoice
and
religious
worship
is
simply
rejoicing
over
blessings
bestowed
it
has
therefore
invariably
and
throughout
the
character
given
in
the
jehovistic
legislation
to
the
feasts
in
which
also
according
to
description
it
culminates
and
is
brought
to
a
focus
for
the
days
of
the
false
gods
on
which
people
adorned
themselves
and
sacrificed
are
just
the
feasts
and
in
fact
the
feasts
of
jehovah
whom
however
the
people
worshipped
by
images
which
the
prophet
regards
as
absolutely
heathenish
equally
instructive
is
the
second
passage

in
their
tents
it
need
not
surprise
us
that
here
again
the
prophet
places
the
worship
which
in
intention
is
obviously
meant
for
jehovah
on
the
same
footing
with
the
heathen
worship
which
actually
has
little
to
distinguish
it
externally
therefrom
being
constrained
to
regard
the
pleasant
things
of
silver
in
the
tents
in
the
high
places
not
as
symbols
of
jehovah
but
as
idols
and
their
worship
as
whoredom
enough
that
once
more
we
have
a
clear
view
of
the
character
of
the
popular
worship
in
israel
at
that
period
and
corn
and
wine
are
its
motives
vociferous
joy
merry
shoutings
its
expression
all
the
pleasure
of
life
is
concentrated
in
the
house
of
jehovah
at
the
joyous
banquets
held
to
celebrate
the
coming
of
the
gifts
of
his
mild
beneficence
no
more
dreadful
thought
than
that
a
man
must
eat
his
bread
like
unclean
food
like
bread
of
mourners
without
having
offered
the
at
the
festival
it
is
this
times
of
mourning
are
so
to
speak
times
of
interdict
during
which
intercourse
between
god
and
man
is
suspended
further
nothing
at
all
was
ever
eaten
except
that
of
which
god
had
in
the
first
instance
received
his
share
not
only
no
flesh
but
also
no
vegetable
food
for
the
of
corn
and
wine
represented
the
produce
of
the
year

sanctified

whole

thought
which
gives
its
sting
to
the
threatened
exile
for
sacrifice
and
feast
are
dependent
upon
the
land
which
is
the
and
the
settled
home
of
the
nation
the
foundation
of
its
existence
and
of
its
worship
the
complete
harmony
of
this
with
the
essential
character
of
the
worship
and
of
the
festivals
in
the
book
of
the
covenant
in
the
law
of
the
two
tables
and
in
deuteronomy
is
clear
in
itself
but
becomes
still
more
evident
by
a
comparison
with
the
priestly
code
to
which
we
now
proceed
in
the
priestly
code
the
festal
cycle
is
dealt
with
in
two
separate
passages
leviticus
xxiii
numbers
xxix
of
which
the
first
contains
a
fragment
xxiii
and
partly
also
xxiii
not
quite
homogeneous
with
the
kernel
of
the
document
in
both
these
accounts
also
the
three
great
feasts
occur
but
with
considerable
alteration
of
their
essential
character
the
festal
celebration
properly
so
called
is
exhausted
by
a
prescribed
joint
offering
there
are
offered
i
during
easter
week
and
also
on
the
day
of
pentecost
besides
the
two
bullocks
one
ram
seven
lambs
as
a
and
one
as
a
daily
at
the
feast
of
tabernacles
from
the
first
to
the
seventh
day
two
rams
fourteen
lambs
and
in
descending
series
from
thirteen
to
seven
bullocks
on
the
eighth
day
one
bullock
one
ram
seven
lambs
as
a
burnt
offering
besides
one
daily
as
a
additional
voluntary
offerings
on
the
part
of
individuals
are
not
excluded
but
are
treated
as
of
secondary
importance
elsewhere
alike
in
the
older
practice
i
seq
and
in
the
law
exodus
xxiii
it
is
precisely
the
festal
offering
that
is
a
sacrificial
meal
that
is
to
say
a
private
sacrifice
in
deuteronomy
it
has
been
possible
to
find
anything
surprising
in
the
joyous
meals
only
because
people
are
wont
to
know
their
old
testament
merely
through
the
perspective
of
the
priestly
code
at
most
the
only
peculiar
thing
in
that
book
is
a
certain
humane
application
of
the
festal
offering
the
offerer
being
required
to
invite
to
it
the
poor
and
landless
of
his
acquaintance
but
this
is
a
development
which
harmonises
much
more
with
the
old
idea
of
an
offering
as
a
communion
between
god
and
man
than
does
the
other
general
churchly
sacrifice
the
passover
alone
continues
in
the
priestly
code
also
to
be
a
sacrificial
meal
and
participation
therein
to
be
restricted
to
the
family
or
a
limited
society
but
this
last
remnant
of
the
old
custom
shows
itself
here
as
a
peculiar
exception
the
festival
in
the
house
instead
of
before
jehovah
has
also
something
ambiguous
about
it
and
turns
the
sacrifice
into
an
entirely
profane
act
of
slaughtering
almost
until
we
come
to
the
rite
of
expiation
which
is
characteristically
retained
exodus
xii
comp
ezekiel
xiv
of
a
piece
with
this
is
the
circumstance
that
the
of
the
season
have
come
to
be
separated
from
the
festivals
still
more
than
had
been
previously
the
case
while
in
deuteronomy
they
are
still
offered
at
the
three
great
sacrificial
meals
in
the
presence
of
jehovah
in
the
priestly
code
they
have
altogether
ceased
to
be
offerings
at
all
and
thus
also
of
course
have
ceased
to
be
festal
offerings
being
merely
dues
payable
to
the
priests
by
whom
they
are
in
part
collected
and
not
in
any
case
brought
before
the
altar
thus
the
feasts
entirely
lose
their
peculiar
characteristics
the
occasions
by
which
they
are
inspired
and
distinguished
by
the
monotonous
sameness
of
the
unvarying
and
of
the
community
as
a
whole
they
are
all
put
on
the
same
even
level
deprived
of
their
natural
spontaneity
and
degraded
into
mere
exercises
of
religion
only
some
very
slight
traces
continue
to
bear
witness
to
we
might
rather
say
to
betray
what
was
the
point
from
which
the
development
started
namely
the
rites
of
the
barley
sheaf
the
loaves
of
bread
and
the
booths
leviticus
but
these
are
mere
rites
petrified
remains
of
the
old
custom
the
actual
belonging
to
the
owners
of
the
soil
are
collected
by
the
priests
the
shadow
of
them
is
retained
at
the
festival
in
the
form
of
the
sheaf
offered
by
the
whole
community
a
piece
of
symbolism
which
has
now
become
quite
separated
from
its
connection
and
is
no
longer
understood
and
since
the
giving
of
thanks
for
the
fruits
of
the
field
has
ceased
to
have
any
substantial
place
in
the
feasts
the
very
shadow
of
connection
between
the
two
also
begins
to
disappear
for
the
rites
of
leviticus
xxiii
are
taken
over
from
an
older
legislation
and
for
the
most
part
are
passed
over
in
silence
in
numbers
xxix
here
again
the
passover
has
followed
a
path
of
its
own
even
at
an
earlier
period
substitution
of
other
cattle
and
sheep
was
permitted
but
now
in
the
priestly
code
the
firstlings
are
strictly
demanded
indeed
but
merely
as
dues
not
as
sacrifices
the
passover
always
a
yearling
lamb
or
kid
has
neither
in
fact
nor
in
time
anything
to
do
with
them
but
occupies
a
separate
position
alongside
but
as
it
is
represented
to
have
been
instituted
in
order
that
the
hebrew
first
born
may
be
spared
in
the
destruction
of
those
of
the
egyptians
this
connection
betrays
the
fact
that
the
yearling
lambs
are
after
all
only
a
substitute
for
the
firstlings
of
all
animals
fit
for
sacrifice
but
in
comparison
with
the
cattle
and
sheep
of
the
jehovistic
tradition
and
deuteronomy
a
secondary
substitute
and
one
for
the
uniformity
of
which
there
is
no
motive
and
we
see
further
that
if
the
firstlings
are
now
over
and
above
assigned
to
the
priests
this
is
equivalent
to
a
reduplication
which
has
been
made
possible
first
by
a
complete
obscuration
and
afterwards
by
an
artificial
revival
of
the
original
custom
a
further
symptom
also
proper
to
be
mentioned
here
is
the
fixing
of
harvest
festival
terms
by
the
days
of
the
month
which
is
to
be
found
exclusively
in
the
priestly
code
easter
falls
upon
the
fifteenth
that
is
at
full
moon
of
the
first
the
feast
of
tabernacles
upon
the
same
day
of
the
seventh
month
pentecost
which
strange
to
say
is
left
undetermined
in
numbers
falls
according
to
leviticus
seven
weeks
after
easter
this
definite
dating
points
not
merely
to
a
fixed
and
uniform
regulation
of
the
cultus
but
also
to
a
change
in
its
contents
for
it
is
not
a
matter
of
indifference
that
according
to
the
legislation
easter
is
observed
in
the
month
of
corn
ears
when
the
sickle
is
put
to
the
corn
pentecost
at
the
end
of
the
wheat
harvest
and
the
feast
of
tabernacles
after
the
ingathering
as
harvest
feasts
they
are
from
their
very
nature
regulated
by
the
condition
of
the
fruits
of
the
soil
when
they
cease
to
be
so
when
they
are
made
to
depend
upon
the
phases
of
the
moon
this
means
that
their
connection
with
their
natural
occasion
is
being
lost
sight
of
doubtless
the
accurate
determination
of
dates
is
correlated
with
the
other
circumstance
that
the
festivals
are
no
longer
kept
in
an
isolated
way
by
people
at
any
place
they
may
choose
but
by
the
whole
united
nation
at
a
single
spot
it
is
therefore
probable
that
the
fixing
of
the
date
w
as
accomplished
at
first
in
the
case
of
the
autumn
festival
which
was
the
first
to
divest
itself
of
its
local
character
and
most
readily
suffered
a
transposition
of
a
week
or
two
it
was
hardest
to
change
in
the
case
of
the
festival
the
putting
of
the
sickle
to
the
corn
is
very
inconvenient
to
shift
but
here
the
passover
seems
to
have
exerted
an
influence
for
the
passover
is
indeed
an
annual
feast
but
not
by
the
nature
of
things
connected
with
any
particular
season
of
the
year
rather
was
it
dependent
originally
on
the
phases
of
the
moon
its
character
as
a
vigil
exodus
xii
lyl
mwrym
points
in
this
direction
as
also
does
the
analogy
of
the
arab
feasts
the
verification
of
the
alleged
denaturalisation
of
the
feasts
in
the
priestly
code
lies
in
this
that
their
historical
interpretation
for
which
the
way
is
already
paved
by
the
jehovistic
tradition
here
attains
its
full
development
for
after
they
have
lost
their
original
contents
and
degenerated
into
mere
prescribed
religious
forms
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
refilling
of
the
empty
bottles
in
any
way
accordant
with
the
tastes
of
the
period
now
accordingly
the
feast
of
tabernacles
also
becomes
historical
leviticus
xxiii
instituted
to
commemorate
the
booths
under
which
the
people
had
to
shelter
themselves
during
the
forty
years
of
wandering
in
the
wilderness
in
the
case
of
easter
a
new
step
in
advance
is
made
beyond
the
assignation
of
its
motive
to
the
exodus
which
is
already
found
in
deuteronomy
and
in
exodus
xiii
seq
for
in
the
priestly
code
this
feast
which
precisely
on
account
of
its
eminently
historical
character
is
here
regarded
as
by
far
the
most
important
of
all
is
much
more
than
the
mere
commemoration
of
a
divine
act
of
salvation
it
is
itself
a
saving
deed
it
is
not
because
jehovah
smote
the
firstborn
of
egypt
that
the
passover
is
afterwards
instituted
on
the
contrary
it
is
instituted
beforehand
at
the
moment
of
the
exodus
in
order
that
the
firstborn
of
israel
may
be
spared
thus
not
merely
is
a
historical
motive
assigned
for
the
custom
its
beginning
is
itself
raised
to
the
dignity
of
a
historical
fact
upon
which
the
feast
rests
the
shadow
elsewhere
thrown
only
by
another
historical
event
here
becomes
substantial
and
casts
itself
the
state
of
matters
in
the
case
of
the
unleavened
cakes
is
very
similar
instead
of
having
it
as
their
occasion
and
object
to
keep
in
remembrance
the
hasty
midnight
departure
in
which
the
travellers
were
compelled
to
carry
with
them
their
dough
unleavened
as
it
was
exodus
xii
in
the
priestly
code
they
also
are
spoken
of
as
having
being
enjoined
beforehand
xii
seq
and
thus
the
festival
is
celebrated
in
commemoration
of
itself
in
other
words
not
merely
is
a
historical
motive
assigned
to
it
it
is
itself
made
a
historical
fact
for
this
reason
also
the
law
relating
to
easter
is
removed
from
all
connection
with
the
tabernacle
legislation
exodus
xii
seq
and
the
difficuity
that
now
in
the
case
of
the
passover
the
sanctuary
which
elsewhere
in
the
priestly
code
is
indispensable
must
be
left
out
of
sight
is
got
over
by
divesting
it
as
much
as
possible
of
its
sacrificial
character
the
ignoring
of
the
sanctuary
has
a
reason
only
in
the
case
of
the
first
passover
and
perhaps
ought
to
be
regarded
as
holding
good
for
that
only
the
distinction
between
the
psx
mcrym
and
the
psx
hdwrwt
is
necessary
if
only
for
the
reason
that
the
former
is
a
historical
fact
the
latter
a
commemorative
observance
when
it
is
argued
for
the
originality
of
the
passover
ritual
in
the
priestly
code
that
it
alone
fits
in
with
the
conditions
of
the
sojourn
in
egypt
the
position
is
not
to
be
disputed
in
the
case
of
pentecost
alone
is
there
no
tendency
to
historical
explanation
that
in
this
instance
has
been
reserved
for
later
judaism
which
from
the
chronology
of
the
book
of
exodus
discerned
in
the
feast
a
commemoration
of
the
giving
of
the
law
at
sinai
but
one
detects
the
drift
of
the
later
time
it
has
been
already
pointed
out
in
what
has
just
been
said
that
as
regards
this
development
the
centralisation
of
the
cultus
was
epochmaking
centralisation
is
synonymous
with
generalisation
and
fixity
and
these
are
the
external
features
by
which
the
festivals
of
the
priestly
code
are
distinguished
from
those
which
preceded
them
in
evidence
i
point
to
the
prescribed
sacrifice
of
the
community
instead
of
the
spontaneous
sacrifice
of
the
individual
to
the
date
fixed
for
the
of
the
month
to
the
complete
separation
between
sacrifices
and
dues
to
the
reduction
of
the
passover
to
uniformity
nothing
is
free
or
the
spontaneous
growth
of
nature
nothing
is
indefinite
and
still
in
process
of
becoming
all
is
statutory
sharply
defined
distinct
but
the
centralisation
of
the
cultus
had
also
not
a
little
to
do
with
the
inner
change
which
the
feasts
underwent
at
first
the
gifts
of
the
various
seasons
of
the
year
are
offered
by
the
individual
houses
as
each
one
finds
convenient
afterwards
they
are
combined
and
festivals
come
into
existence
last
of
all
the
united
offerings
of
individuals
fall
into
the
back
ground
when
compared
with
the
single
on
behalf
of
the
entire
community
according
as
stress
is
laid
upon
the
common
character
of
the
festival
and
uniformity
in
its
observance
in
precisely
the
same
degree
does
it
become
separated
from
the
roots
from
which
it
sprang
and
grow
more
and
more
abstract
that
it
is
then
very
ready
to
assume
a
historical
meaning
may
partly
also
be
attributed
to
the
circumstance
that
history
is
not
like
harvest
a
personal
experience
of
individual
households
but
rather
an
experience
of
the
nation
as
a
whole
one
does
not
fail
to
observe
of
course
that
the
festivals
which
always
to
a
certain
degree
have
a
centralising
tendency
have
in
themselves
a
disposition
to
become
removed
from
the
particular
motives
of
their
institution
but
in
no
part
of
the
legislation
has
this
gone
so
far
as
in
the
priestly
code
while
everywhere
else
they
still
continue
to
stand
as
we
have
seen
in
a
clear
relationship
to
the
land
and
its
increase
and
are
at
one
and
the
same
time
the
great
days
of
homage
and
tribute
for
the
superior
and
grantor
of
the
soil
here
this
connection
falls
entirely
out
of
sight
as
in
opposition
to
the
book
of
the
covenant
and
deuteronomy
nay
even
to
the
corpus
itself
which
forms
the
basis
of
leviticus
one
can
characterise
the
entire
priestly
code
as
the
wilderness
legislation
inasmuch
as
it
abstracts
from
the
natural
conditions
and
motives
of
the
actual
life
of
the
people
in
the
land
of
canaan
and
rears
the
hierocracy
on
the
of
the
wilderness
the
negation
of
nature
by
means
of
the
bald
statutes
of
arbitrary
absolutism
so
also
the
festivals
in
which
the
connection
of
the
cultus
with
agriculture
appears
most
strongly
have
as
much
as
possible
been
turned
into
wilderness
festivals
but
most
of
all
the
easter
festival
which
at
the
same
time
has
become
the
most
important
the
centralisation
of
the
cultus
the
revolutionising
influence
of
which
is
seen
in
the
priestly
code
is
begun
by
deuteronomy
the
former
rests
upon
the
latter
and
draws
its
as
yet
unsuspected
consequences
this
general
relation
is
maintained
also
in
details
in
the
first
place
in
the
names
of
the
feasts
which
are
the
same
in
both
shabuoth
this
is
not
without
its
inner
significance
for
ingathering
would
have
placed
much
greater
hindrances
in
the
way
of
the
introduction
of
a
historical
interpretation
than
does
sukkoth
booths
so
also
with
the
prominence
given
to
the
passover
a
festival
mentioned
nowhere
previously
a
prominence
which
is
much
more
striking
in
the
priestly
code
than
in
deuteronomy
next
this
relation
is
observed
in
the
duration
of
the
feasts
while
deuteronomy
certainly
does
not
fix
their
date
of
commencement
with
the
same
definiteness
it
nevertheless
in
this
respect
makes
a
great
advance
upon
the
jehovistic
legislation
inasmuch
as
it
lays
down
the
rule
of
a
week
for
easter
and
tabernacles
and
of
a
day
for
pentecost
the
priestly
code
is
on
the
whole
in
agreement
with
this
and
also
with
the
time
determination
of
the
relation
of
pentecost
to
easter
but
its
provisions
are
more
fully
developed
in
details
the
passover
in
the
first
month
on
the
evening
of
the
here
also
indeed
begins
the
feast
but
does
not
as
in
deuteronomy
xvi
count
as
the
first
day
of
easter
week
on
the
contrary
the
latter
does
not
begin
until
the
and
closes
with
the
comp
leviticus
xxiii
numbers
xxviii
exodus
xii
the
beginning
of
the
festival
week
being
thus
distinctly
indicated
there
arises
in
this
way
not
merely
an
ordinary
but
also
an
feast
day
more
the
day
after
the
passover
on
which
already
according
to
the
injunctions
of
deuteronomy
the
pilgrims
were
required
to
set
out
early
in
the
morning
on
the
return
journey
to
their
homes
it
is
impossible
to
explain
away
this
discrepancy
by
the
circumstance
that
in
the
priestly
code
the
day
is
reckoned
from
the
evening
for
this
fact
has
no
practical
bearing
as
the
dating
reckons
at
any
rate
from
the
morning
and
the
evening
preceding
the
is
always
called
the
of
the
month
leviticus
xiii
the
first
day
of
the
feast
in
deuteronomy
is
just
the
day
on
the
evening
of
which
the
passover
is
held
and
upon
it
there
follow
not
seven
but
six
days
more
whereas
in
the
priestly
code
the
celebration
extends
from
the
to
the
of
the
month
exodus
xii
when
the
mxrt
h
bt
is
made
to
refer
not
as
in
josh
to
the
but
as
in
jewish
tradition
lxx
on
leviticus
xxiii
to
the
day
following
the
of
nisan
thee
of
nisan
is
added
to
the
and
as
a
special
feast
day
another
advance
consists
in
this
that
not
only
the
passover
as
in
deuteronomy
or
the
additional
first
day
of
the
feast
besides
but
also
the
seventh
which
according
to
deuteronomy
xvi
is
marked
only
by
rest
must
be
observed
as
in
jerusalem
in
other
words
such
pilgrims
as
do
not
live
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
are
compelled
to
pass
the
whole
week
there
an
exaction
which
enables
us
to
mark
the
progress
made
with
centralisation
when
the
much
more
moderate
demands
of
deuteronomy
are
compared
the
feast
of
tabernacles
is
in
the
latter
law
also
observed
from
beginning
to
end
at
jerusalem
but
the
priestly
code
has
contrived
to
add
to
it
an
eighth
day
as
an
to
the
principal
feast
which
indeed
still
appears
to
be
wanting
in
the
older
portion
of
leviticus
xxiii
from
all
this
it
is
indisputable
that
the
priestly
code
has
its
nearest
relations
with
deuteronomy
but
goes
beyond
it
in
the
same
direction
as
that
in
which
deuteronomy
itself
goes
beyond
the
jehovistic
legislation
in
any
case
the
intermediate
place
in
the
series
belongs
to
deuteronomy
and
if
we
begin
that
series
with
the
priestly
code
we
must
in
consistency
close
it
with
the
sinaitic
book
of
the
covenant
exodus
xx
after
king
josiah
had
published
deuteronomy
and
had
made
it
the
book
of
the
covenant
by
a
solemn
engagement
of
the
people
he
commanded
them
to
keep
the
passover
to
jehovah
your
god
as
it
is
written
in
this
book
such
a
passover
had
never
been
observed
from
the
days
of
the
judges
or
throughout
the
entire
period
of
the
kings
xxiii
and
when
ezra
the
scribe
introduced
the
pentateuch
as
we
now
have
it
as
the
fundamental
law
of
the
church
of
the
second
temple
it
was
found
written
in
the
torah
which
jehovah
had
commanded
by
moses
that
the
children
of
israel
were
to
live
in
booths
during
the
feast
in
the
seventh
month
and
further
to
use
branches
of
olive
and
myrtle
and
palm
for
this
purpose
and
that
the
people
went
and
made
to
themselves
booths
accordingly
such
a
thing
had
not
been
done
since
the
days
of
joshua
the
son
of
nun
even
unto
that
day
nehemiah
viii
that
josiah
passover
rests
upon
deuteronomy
xvi
and
not
upon
exodus
xii
is
sufficiently
proved
by
the
circumstance
that
the
observance
of
the
festival
stands
in
connection
with
the
new
unity
of
the
cultus
and
is
intended
to
be
an
exemplification
of
it
while
the
precept
of
exodus
if
literally
followed
could
only
have
served
to
destroy
it
we
thus
find
that
the
two
promulgations
of
the
law
so
great
in
their
importance
and
so
like
one
another
in
their
character
both
take
place
at
the
time
of
a
festival
the
one
in
spring
the
other
in
harvest
and
we
also
discover
that
the
festal
observance
of
the
priestly
code
first
began
to
show
life
and
to
gain
currency
about
two
hundred
years
later
than
that
of
deuteronomy
this
can
be
proved
in
yet
another
way
the
author
of
the
book
of
kings
knows
only
of
a
seven
days
duration
of
the
feast
of
tabernacles
viii
solomon
dismisses
the
people
on
the
eighth
day
on
the
other
hand
in
the
parallel
passage
in
chronicles
vii
the
king
holds
the
on
the
eighth
and
does
not
dismiss
the
people
until
the
following
day
the
of
the
month
that
is
to
say
the
deuteronomic
use
which
is
followed
by
the
older
author
and
by
ezekiel
xiv
who
was
roughly
speaking
his
contemporary
is
corrected
by
the
later
writer
into
conformity
with
that
of
the
priestly
code
in
force
since
the
time
of
ezra
nehemiah
viii
in
later
judaism
the
inclination
to
assert
most
strongly
precisely
that
which
is
most
open
to
dispute
led
to
the
result
that
the
eighth
day
of
the
feast
was
regarded
as
the
most
splendid
of
all
john
vii
on
this
question
also
the
book
of
ezekiel
stands
nearest
the
priestly
code
ordaining
as
follows
xiv
in
the
first
month
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
the
month
ye
shall
keep
the
passover
ye
shall
eat
maccoth
seven
days
on
that
day
shall
the
prince
offer
for
himself
and
for
all
the
people
of
the
land
a
bullock
for
a
and
during
the
seven
days
he
shall
offer
a
to
the
lord
seven
bullocks
and
seven
rams
daily
for
the
seven
days
and
a
daily
for
a
sin
offering
and
he
shall
offer
as
a
an
ephah
for
every
bullock
and
every
ram
and
a
hin
of
oil
for
the
ephah
in
the
seventh
month
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
month
in
the
feast
shall
he
do
the
like
for
seven
days
according
to
the
according
to
the
and
according
to
the
and
according
to
the
oil
here
indeed
in
details
hardly
any
point
is
in
agreement
with
the
prescriptions
of
the
ritual
law
of
leviticus
numbers
xxix
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
day
of
pentecost
is
omitted
it
is
restored
in
the
massoretic
text
by
an
absurd
correction
in
ver
in
the
first
place
there
is
a
discrepancy
as
to
the
duration
of
the
feasts
both
last
seven
and
not
eight
days
and
the
passover
is
taken
for
the
first
day
of
easter
as
in
deuteronomy
further
the
offerings
differ
alike
by
their
number
and
by
their
quality
in
particular
nothing
is
said
of
the
passover
lamb
but
a
bullock
as
a
general
is
mentioned
instead
from
the
the
wine
is
wanting
but
this
must
be
left
out
of
the
account
for
ezekiel
banishes
wine
from
the
service
on
principle
lastly
it
is
not
the
congregation
that
sacrifices
but
the
prince
for
himself
and
for
the
people
but
in
spite
of
all
differences
the
general
similarity
is
apparent
one
sees
that
here
for
the
first
time
we
have
something
which
at
all
points
admits
of
correlation
with
the
priestly
code
but
is
quite
disparate
with
the
jehovistic
legislation
and
half
so
with
that
of
deuteronomy
on
both
hands
we
find
the
term
fixed
according
to
the
day
of
the
month
the
strictly
prescribed
joint
and
the
absence
of
relation
and
agriculture
the
obliteration
of
natural
distinctions
so
as
to
make
one
general
churchly
festival
but
ezekiel
surely
could
hardly
have
had
any
motive
for
reproducing
leviticus
xxiii
and
numbers
xxviii
and
still
less
for
the
introduction
of
a
number
of
aimless
variations
as
he
did
so
let
it
be
observed
that
in
no
one
detail
does
he
contradict
deuteronomy
while
yet
he
stands
so
infinitely
nearer
to
the
priestly
code
the
relationship
is
not
an
arbitrary
one
but
arises
from
their
place
in
time
ezekiel
is
the
forerunner
of
the
priestly
legislator
in
the
pentateuch
his
pence
and
people
to
some
extent
invested
with
the
colouring
of
the
bygone
period
of
the
monarchy
are
the
antecedents
of
the
congregation
of
the
tabernacle
and
the
second
temple
against
this
supposition
there
is
nothing
to
be
alleged
and
it
is
the
rational
one
for
this
reason
that
it
was
not
ezekiel
but
the
priestly
code
that
furnished
the
norm
for
the
praxis
of
the
later
period
for
as
the
festival
system
of
the
priestly
code
absolutely
refuses
to
accommodate
itself
to
the
manner
of
the
older
worship
as
we
are
made
acquainted
with
it
in
hos
ix
and
elsewhere
in
the
same
degree
does
it
furnish
in
every
respect
the
standard
for
the
praxis
of
judaism
and
therefore
also
for
our
ideas
thence
derived
no
one
in
reading
the
new
testament
dreams
of
any
other
manner
of
keeping
the
passover
than
that
of
exodus
or
of
any
other
offering
than
the
paschal
lamb
there
prescribed
one
might
perhaps
hazard
the
conjecture
that
if
in
the
wilderness
legislation
of
the
code
there
is
no
trace
of
agriculture
being
regarded
as
the
basis
of
life
which
it
still
is
in
deuteronomy
and
even
in
the
kernel
of
leviticus
this
also
is
a
proof
that
the
code
belongs
to
a
very
recent
rather
than
to
a
very
early
period
when
agriculture
was
no
longer
rather
than
not
yet
with
the
babylonian
captivity
the
jews
lost
their
fixed
seats
and
so
became
a
trading
people
no
notice
has
as
yet
been
taken
of
one
phenomenon
which
distinguishes
the
priestly
code
namely
that
in
it
the
tripartite
cycle
of
the
feasts
is
extended
and
interrupted
in
the
chronologically
arranged
enumeration
of
leviticus
xxiii
and
numbers
two
other
feast
days
are
interpolated
between
pentecost
and
tabernacles
new
year
on
the
first
and
the
great
day
of
atonement
on
the
tenth
of
the
seventh
month
one
perceives
to
what
an
extent
the
three
originally
connected
harvest
feasts
have
lost
their
distinctive
character
when
it
is
observed
that
these
two
heterogeneous
days
make
their
appearance
in
the
midst
of
them
the
in
the
same
series
with
the
old
dances
which
were
occasions
of
pure
pleasure
and
joy
not
to
be
named
in
the
same
day
with
fasts
and
mournings
the
following
points
demand
notice
in
detail
in
the
period
of
the
kings
the
change
of
the
year
occurred
in
autumn
the
autumn
festival
marked
the
close
of
the
year
and
of
the
festal
cycle
exodus
xxiii
xxxiv
i
isaiah
xxix
xxxii
deuteronomy
was
discovered
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
josiah
and
in
the
very
same
year
easter
was
observed
in
accordance
with
the
prescriptions
of
that
law
which
could
not
have
been
unless
the
year
had
begun
in
autumn
now
the
ecclesiastical
festival
of
new
year
in
the
priestly
code
is
also
autumnal
the
leviticus
xxiii
in
this
way
tabernacles
comes
not
before
but
after
new
year
this
probably
is
connected
with
the
more
definite
dating
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
month
but
is
quite
contrary
to
the
old
custom
and
the
meaning
of
the
feast
numbers
xxix
seq
falls
on
the
first
new
moon
of
autumn
and
it
follows
from
a
tradition
confirmed
by
leviticus
xxv
that
this
day
was
celebrated
as
new
year
r
h
nh
but
it
is
always
spoken
of
as
the
first
of
the
seventh
month
that
is
to
say
the
civil
new
year
has
been
separated
from
the
ecclesiastical
and
been
transferred
to
spring
the
ecclesiastical
can
only
be
regarded
as
a
relic
surviving
from
an
earlier
period
and
betrays
strikingly
the
priority
of
the
division
of
the
year
that
prevailed
in
the
time
of
the
older
monarchy
it
appears
to
have
first
begun
to
give
way
under
the
influence
of
the
babylonians
who
observed
the
spring
era
for
the
designation
of
the
in
exodus
xii
this
change
of
era
is
formally
commanded
by
moses
this
month
the
passover
month
shall
be
the
beginning
of
months
unto
you
it
shall
be
to
you
the
first
of
the
months
of
the
year
according
to
george
smith
the
assyrian
year
commenced
at
the
vernal
equinox
the
assyrian
use
depends
on
the
babylonian
assyrian
eponym
canon

by
numbers
instead
of
by
the
old
hebrew

the
like
a
style
which
arises
together
with
the
use
of
the
spring
era
does
not
yet
occur
in
deuteronomy
but
apart
from
the
priestly
code
and
the
last
redactor
of
the
pentateuch
deuteronomy
i
is
found
for
the
first
time
in
writers
of
the
period
of
the
exile
it
is
first
found
in
jeremiah
but
only
in
those
portions
of
his
book
which
were
not
committed
to
writing
by
him
or
at
least
have
been
edited
by
a
later
hand

then
in

and

author
of

book

explains
the
names
he
found
in
his
source
by
giving
the
numbers
vi

next
in
haggai
and
zechariah
and
lastly
in
chronicles
though
here
already
the
names
of
the
months
which
at
first
were
not
used
in
hebrew
have
begun
to
find
their
way
in
nehemiah
i
ii
zech
i
the
syrian
names
are
always
given
along
with
the
numbers
in
the
book
of
esther
and
are
used
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
in
that
of
maccabees
it
would
be
absurd
to
attempt
to
explain
this
demonstrable
change
which
took
place
in
the
calendar
after
the
exile
as
a
mere
incidental
effect
of
the
priestly
code
hitherto
in
a
state
of
suspended
animation
rather
than
by
reference
to
general
causes
arising
from
the
circumstances
of
the
time
under
whose
influence
the
priestly
code
itself
also
stood
and
which
then
had
for
their
result
a
complete
change
in
the
greater
accuracy
and
more
general
applicability
of
the
methods
by
which
time
was
reckoned
a
similar
phenomenon
presents
itself
in
connection
with
the
metric
system
the
shekel
of
the
sanctuary
often
mentioned
in
the
priestly
code
and
there
only
can
not
possibly
have
borne
this
name
until
the
most
natural
objects
of
the
old
israelite
had
begun
to
appear
surrounded
by
a
legendary
nimbus
because
themselves
no
longer
in
actual
existence
over
against
it
we
have
the
king
weight
mentioned
in
a
gloss
in
xiv
the
king
being
none
other
than
the
great
king
of
babylon
it
is
an
interesting
circumstance
that
the
shekel
of
the
sanctuary
spoken
of
in
the
priestly
code
is
still
the
ordinary
shekel
in
ezekiel
compare
exodus
xxx
with
ezekiel
xliv
during
the
exile
the
observance
of
the
ecclesiastical
new
year
seems
to
have
taken
place
not
on
the
first
but
on
the
tenth
of
the
seventh
month
leviticus
xxv
ezekiel
xl
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
wondered
at
in
this
after
once
it

his

the

of
the

of

in

at

subsequent
period
was
observed
on

in

towards

looks
back
upon
two
regular
fast
days
in

having
been
in

for
seventy

adds

two

in

they
refer
according
to
the
very
probable
explanation
of

to
the
historical
days
of
calamity
which
preceded
the

on
the
ninth

zechariah
also
still
knows
nothing
of
the
great
day
of
atonement
in
leviticus
but
only
mentions
among
others
the
fast
of
the
seventh
month
as
having
subsisted
for
seventy
years
even
in
the
year
of
the
publication
of

by

the
great
day
of

has
not
yet
come
into
force
ezra

the
reading
of
the
law
in
the
beginning
of

and
afterwards
the

of

is
observed
on
the
fifteenth
of
an
atoning
solemnity
on
the
tenth
of
the
month
not
a
word
is
said
in
the
circumstantial
narrative
which
moreover
is
one
specially
interested
in
the
liturgical
element
but
it
is
made
up
for
on
the
nehemiah
this
e
is
enough
down
to
that
date
the
great
day
of
the
priestly
code
now
introduced
for
the
first
time
had
not
existed
the
term
is
if
leviticus
xvi
belongs
to
the
original
of
the
priestly
code
and
the
entire
pentateuch
was
published
by
ezra
in
the
year
and
yet
the
day
was
not
then
celebrated
then
it
has
been
conceded
that
it
is
possible
that
there
can
be
laws
which
yet
are
not
carried
into
effect
so
writes
dillmann
in
his
introduction
to
leviticus
xvi
every
one
will
grant
him
that
the
law
before
it
could
attain
public
currency
must
have
been
previously
written
and
promulgated
partly
fixed
following
ezekiel
by
reference
to
the
old
new
year
day
leviticus
xxv
partly
following
zechariah
by
reference
to
the
fast
of
gedaliah
which
indeed
was
still
observed
later
as
a
separate
solemnity
even
before
the
exile
general
fast
days
doubtless
occurred
but
they
were
specially
appointed
and
always
arose
out
of
extraordinary
occasions
when
some
sin
was
brought
home
to
the
public
conscience
or
when
the
divine
anger
threatened
especially
in
connection
with
calamities
affecting
the
produce
of
the

in

in

in
remembrance
of
the
that
had
been
experienced

also
in
a

as
a
surrogate
suited
to
the
circumstances
for
the

tabernacles
which
were
possible
only
in
the
holy
land
after
the
second
destruction
of
jerusalem
by
titus
the
system
of
fasts
received
such
an
impulse
that
it
was
necessary
to
draw
up
a
list
of
the
days
on
which
fasting
was
forbidden
at
last
they
came
into
a
position
of
with
the
feasts
and
became
a
stated
and
very
important
element
of
the
ordinary
worship
in
the
priestly
code
the
great
fast
in
the
tenth
of
the
seventh
month
is
the
holiest
day
of
all
the
year
nothing
could
illustrate
more
clearly
the
contrast
between
the
new
cultus
and
the
old
fixing
its
regard
at
all
points
on
sin
and
its
atonement
it
reaches
its
culmination
in
a
great
atoning
solemnity
it
is
as
if
the
temper
of
the
exile
had
carried
itself
into
the
time
of
liberation
also
at
least
during
the
opening
centuries
as
if
men
had
felt
themselves
not
as
in
an
earlier
age
only
momentarily
and
in
special
circumstances
but
unceasingly
under
the
leaden
pressure
of
sin
and
wrath
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
here
expressly
that
also
in
regard
to
the
day
of
atonement
as
a
day
sacred
above
all
others
the
priestly
code
became
authoritative
for
the
period
ritual
and
sacrifice
have
through
the
misfortunes
of
the
times
disappeared
but
this
has
retained
all
its
old
sacredness
unless
a
man
has
wholly
cut
himself
adrift
from
judaism
he
keeps
this
day
however
indifferent
he
may
be
to
all
its
other
usages
and
feasts
a
word
lastly
on
the
lunar
feasts
that
is
new
moon
and
sabbath
that
the
two
are
connected
can
not
be
gathered
from
the
pentateuch
but
something
of
the
sort
is
implied
in
amos
viii
and
iv
in
amos
the
impatient
of
every
interruption
of
their
trade
exclaim
when
will
the
new
moon
be
gone
that
we
may
sell
corn
and
the
sabbath
that
we
may
set
forth

she
begs

now
for
it

neither

it
is

say
probably
the
sabbath
was
originally
regulated
by
the
phases
of
the

and
thus
occurred
on
the
seventh
fourteenth
and
day
of
the

the

being
reckoned
as

no

the

seems
very
barely
credible
it
was
not
until
after
people
had
got
their
seven
days
that
they
began
to
call
them
after
the
seven
planets
the
peculiar
order
in
which

very
clear
see

the
number
seven
is
the
only
bond
of
connection
between
them
doubtless
the
week
is
older
than
the
names
of
its
days
lunar
feasts
we
may
safely
say
are
in
every
case
older
than
annual
or
harvest
feasts
and
certainly
they
are
so
in
the
case
of
the
hebrews
in
the
period
the
new
moon
must
have
been
observed
with
such
preference
that
an
ancient
name
for
it
which
is
no
longer
found
in
biblical
hebrew
even
furnished
the
root
of
the
general
word
for
a
festive
occasion
which
is
used
for
the
vintage
feast
in
a
passage
so
early
as
judges

leben

iii
and
lagarde
have
rightly
correlated
the
hebrew
with
the
arabic
to
call
out
see
for
example
abulf
but
there
is
no
uncertainty
as
to
the
derivation
of
from
new
moon
but
it
is
established
by
historical
testimonies
besides
that
the
new
moon
festival
anciently
stood
at
least
on
a
level
with
that
of
the
sabbath
compare
xx
iv
annos
viii
isa
i
hos
ii
in
the
jehovistic
and
deuteronomic
legislation
however
it
is
completely
ignored
and
if
it
comes
into
somewhat
greater
prominence
in
that
of
ezekiel
and
the
priestly
code
but
without
being
for
a
moment
to
be
compared
with
the
sabbath
this
perhaps
has
to
do
with
the
circumstance
that
in
the
latter
the
great
festivals
are
regulated
by
the
new
moon
and
that
therefore
it
is
important
that
this
should
be
observed
it
may
have
been
with
a
deliberate
intention
that
the
new
moon
festival
was
thrust
aside
on
account
of
all
sorts
of
heathenish
superstition
which
readily
associated
themselves
with
it
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
possible
that
the
undersigned
preponderance
gained
by
the
sabbath
may
have
ultimately
given
it
independence
and
led
to
the
reckoning
of
time
by
regular
intervals
of
seven
days
without
regard
to
new
moon
with
which
now
it
came
into
collision
instead
of
as
formerly
being
supported
by
it
as
a
lunar
festival
doubtless
the
sabbath
also
went
back
to
a
very
remote
antiquity
but
with
the
israelites
the
day
acquired
an
altogether
peculiar
significance
whereby
it
was
distinguished
from
all
other
feast
days
it
became
the
day
of
rest
originally
the
rest
is
only
a
consequence
of
the
feast
that
of
the
harvest
festival
after
the
period
of
severe
labour
the
new
moons
also
were
marked
in
this
way
amos
viii
iv
in
the
case
of
the
sabbath
also
rest
is
properly
speaking
only
the
consequence
of
the
fact
that
the
day
is
the
festal
and
sacrificial
day
of
the
week
isaiah
i
ezekiel
xlvi
seq
on
which
the
shewbread
was
laid
out
but
here
doubtless
on
account
of
the
regularity
with
which
it
every
eighth
day
interrupted
the
round
of
everyday
work
this
gradually
became
the
essential
attribute
in
the
end
even
its
name
came
to
be
interpreted
as
if
derived
from
the
verb
to
rest
but
as
a
day
of
rest
it
can
not
be
so
very
primitive
in
its
origin
in
this
attribute
it
presupposes
agriculture
and
a
tolerably
life
with
this
it
agrees
that
an
intensification
of
the
rest
of
the
sabbath
among
the
israelites
admits
of
being
traced
in
the
course
of
the
history
the
highest
development
amounting
even
to
a
change
of
quality
is
seen
in
the
priestly
code
according
to
iv
one

on

time

that
are
not
of
an
everyday
kind

we
read
i
make
an
end
of
all
your
joy
your
feasts
your
new

and
your
sabbaths
that
is
to
say
the
share
with
the
first
the
happy
joyousness
which
is
impossible
in
the
exile
which
jehovah
threatens
with
the
jehovist
and
the
deuteronomist
the
sabbath
which
it
is
true
is
already
extended
in
amos
viii
to
commerce
is
an
institution
specially
for
agriculture
it
is
the
day
of
refreshment
for
the
people
and
the
cattle
and
is
accordingly
employed
for
social
ends
in
the
same
way
as
the

meal
is

xxiii
xxxiv
deuteronomy
although
the
moral
turn
given
to
the
observance
is
genuinely
israelitic
and
not
original
yet
the
rest
even
here
still
continues
to
be
a
feast
a
satisfaction
for
the
labouring
classes
for
what
is
enjoined
as
a
duty
upon
the
israelite
rulers
that
is
to
whom
the
legislation
is
directed
is
less
that
they
should
rest
than
that
they
should
give
rest
in
the
priestly
code
on
the
contrary
the
rest
of
the
sabbath
has
nothing
at
all
of
the
nature
of
the
joyous
from
the
load
of
life
which
a
festival
affords
but
is
a
thing
for
itself
which
separates
the
sabbath
not
only
from
the
week
days
but
also
from
the
festival
days
and
approaches
an
ascetic
exercise
much
more
nearly
than
a
restful
refreshment
it
is
taken
in
a
perfectly
abstract
manner
not
as
rest
from
ordinary
work
but
as
rest
absolutely
on
the
holy
day
it
is
not
lawful
to
leave
the
camp
to
gather
sticks
or
manna
exod
xvi
numbers
xv
not
even
to
kindle
a
fire
or
cook

meal
exodus
xxxv
this
rest
is
in
fact
a
sacrifice
of
abstinence
from
all
occupation
for
which
preparation
must
already
begin
on
the
preceding
day
exodus
of
the
sabbath
of
the
priestly
code
in
fact
it
could
not
be
said
that
it
was
made
for
man
mark
ii
rather
is
it
a
statute
that
presents
itself
with
all
the
rigour
of
a
law
of
nature
having
its
reason
with
itself
and
being
observed
even
by
the
creator
the
original
narrative
of
the
creation
according
to
which
god
finished
his
work
on
the
seventh
day
and
therefore
sanctified
it
is
amended
so
as
to
be
made
to
say
that
he
finished
in
six
days
and
rested
on
the
seventh
the
contradiction
is
indubitable
when
in
genesis
ii
it
is
said
in
the
first
place
that
on
the
seventh
day
god
ended
the
work
which
he
had
made
and
then
that
he
rested
on
the
seventh
day
from
his
work
obviously
the
second
clause
is
an
authentic
interpretation
added
from
very
intelligible
motives
tendencies
to
such
an
exaggeration
of
the
sabbath
rest
as
would
make
it
absolute
are
found
from
the
chaldaean
period
while
isaiah
regarding
the
sabbath
purely
as
a
sacrificial
day
says
bring
no
more
vain
oblations
it
is
an
abominable
incense
unto
me
new
moon
and
sabbath
the
temple
assembly
can
not
endure
iniquity
and
solemn
meeting
jeremiah
on
the
other
hand
is
the
first
of
the
prophets
who
stands
up
for
a
stricter
sanctification
of
the
seventh
day
treating
it
however
merely
as
a
day
of
rest
bear
no
burden
on
the
sabbath
day
neither
bring
in
by
the
gates
of
jerusalem
nor
carry
forth
a
burden
out
of
your
houses
neither
do
ye
any
work
xvii
he
adds
that
this
precept
had
indeed
been
given
to
the
fathers
but
hitherto
has
not
been
kept
thus
what
was
traditional
appears
to
have
been
only
the
abstinence
from
field
work
and
perhaps
also
from
professional
pursuits
in
this
respect
the
attitude
of
jeremiah
is
that
which
is
taken
also
by
his
exilian
followers
not
merely
by
ezekiel
xx
xxii
but
also
by
the
great
unknown
isaiah
lvi
lviii
who
does
not
otherwise
manifest
any
express
partiality
for

the
sabbath
as
well
as
the
rest

acts
of

worship
must
cease
outside
of
the
holy
land
it
in
fact
gained
in
importance
to
an
extraordinary
degree
during
the
exile
having
severed
itself
completely
not
merely
from
agriculture
but
in
particular
also
from
the
sacrificial
system
and
gained
entire
independence
as
a
holy
solemnity
of
rest
accordingly
it
became
along
with
circumcision
the
symbol
that
bound
together
the
jewish
diaspora

already
in
the
priestly
code

two
institutions

the
general
distinguishing

the
trouble
which
in
the
meantime
the
organisers
of
the
church
of
the
second
temple
had
in
forcing
into
effect
the
new
and
strict
regulations
is
clear
from
nehemiah
xiii
seq
but
they
were
ultimately
successful
the
solemnisation
of
the
sabbath
in
judaism
continued
to
develop
logically
on
the
basis
of
the
priestly
legislation
but
always
approximating
with
increasing
nearness
to
the
idea
of
absolute
rest
so
that
for
the
straitest
sect
of
the
pharisees
the
business
of
preparing
for
the
sacred
day
absorbed
the
whole
week
and
half
man
life
so
to
speak
existed
for
it
alone
from
sunday
onwards
think
of
the
sabbath
says
shammai
two
details
are
worthy
of
special
prominence
the
distinction
between
and
comparable
to
that
drawn
by
the
puritans
between
sundays
and
feast
days
and
the
discussion
as
to
whether
the
sabbath
was
broken
by
divine
worship
both
bring
into
recognition
that
tendency
of
the
priestly
code
in
which
the
later
custom
separates
itself
from
its
original
roots
connected
with
the
sabbath
is
the
sabbatical
year
in
the
book
of
the
covenant
it
is
commanded
that
a
hebrew
who
has
been
bought
as
a
slave
must
after
six
years
of
service
be
liberated
on
the
seventh
unless
he
himself
wishes
to
remain
exodus
xxi
by
the
same
authority
it
is
ordained
in
another
passage
that
the
land
and
are
to
be
wrought
and
their
produce
gathered
for
six
years
but
on
the
seventh
the
produce
is
to
be
surrendered
that
the
poor
of
the
people
may
eat
and
what
they
leave
the
beasts
of
the
field
may
e
at
xxiii
here
there
is
no
word
of
a
sabbatical
year
the
liberation
of
the
hebrew
slave
takes
place
six
years
after
his
purchase
that
is
the
term
is
a
relative
one
in
like
manner
in
the
other
ordinance
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
an
absolute
seventh
year
and
besides
it
is
not
a
sabbath
or
fallow
time
for
the
that
is
contemplated
but
a
surrender
of
the
the
first
of
these
commands
is
repeated
in
deuteronomy
without
material
alteration
and
to
a
certain
extent
word
for
word
xv
the
other
has
at
least
an
analogue
in
deuteronomy
xv
at
the
end
of
every
seven
years
thou
shalt
make
a
release
surrender
and
this
is
the
manner
of
it
no
creditor
that
lendeth
aught
shall
exact
it
of
his
neighbour
or
of
his
brother
because
jehovah
release
has
been
proclaimed
of
a
foreigner
thou
mayst
exact
it
again
but
that
which
is
of
thine
with
thy
brother
thy
hand
shall
release
that
this
precept
is
parallel
with
exodus
xxiii
is
shown
by
the
word
but
this
has
a
different
meaning
put
upon
it
which
plainly
is
introduced
as
new
here
it
is
not
landed
property
that
is
being
dealt
with
but
money
and
what
has
to
be
surrendered
is
not
the
interest
of
the
debt
merely
comparable
to
the
fruit
of
the
soil
but
the
capital
itself
the
last
clause
admits
of
no
other
construction
however
unsuitable
the
regulation
may
be
a
step
towards
the
sabbatical
year
is
discernible
in
it
in
so
far
as
the
seventh
year
term
is
not
a
different
one
for
each
individual
debt
according
to
the
date
when
it
was
incurred
in
which
case
it
might
have
been
simply
a
period
of
prescription
but
is
a
uniform
and
common
term
publicly
fixed
it
is
absolute
not
relative
but
it
does
not
embrace
the
whole
seventh
year
it
does
not
come
in
at
the
end
of
six
years
as
in
exodus
but
at
the
end
of
seven
the
surrender
of
the
harvest
demands
the
whole
year
the
remission
of
debts
comparatively
speaking
only
a
moment
the
sabbatical
year
is
peculiar
to
the
priestly
code
or
to
speak
more
correctly
to
that
collection
of
laws
incorporated
and
edited
by
it
which
lies
at
the
basis
of
leviticus
in
leviticus
xxv
we
read
when
ye
come
into
the
land
which
i
give
you
then
shall
the
land
keep
a
sabbath
to
jehovah
six
years
shalt
thou
sow
thy
field
and
prune
thy
vineyard
and
gather
in
the
fruit
thereof
but
in
the
seventh
year
shall
the
land
keep
a
sabbath
of
rest
unto
jehovah
thy
field
shalt
thou
not
sow
thy
vineyard
shalt
thou
not
prune
that
which
groweth
of
its
own
accord
of
thy
harvest
shalt
thou
not
reap
neither
shalt
thou
gather
the
grapes
of
thy
vine
undressed
the
land
shall
have
a
year
of
rest
and
the
sabbath
of
the
land
shall
be
food
for
you
for
thee
and
for
thy
servant
and
for
thy
maid
and
for
thy
hired
servant
and
for
thy
cattle
and
for
all
the
beasts
that
are
in
thy
land
shall
all
the
increase
thereof
be
food
the
expressions
make
it
impossible
to
doubt
that
exodus
xxiii
lies
at
the
foundation
of
this
law
but
out
of
this
as
a
basis
it
is
something
different
that
has
been
framed
the
seventh
year
which
is
there
a
relative
one
has
here
become
fixed
not
varying
for
the
various
properties
but
common
for
the
whole
land
a
sabbatical
year
after
the
manner
of
the
sabbath
day
this
amounts
to
a
serious
increase
in
the
difficulty
of
the
matter
for
it
is
not
one
and
the
same
thing
to
have
the
abstinence
from
harvest
spread
over
seven
years
and
to
have
it
concentrated
into
one
out
of
every
seven
in
like
manner
a
heightening
of
the
demand
is
also
seen
in
the
circumstance
that
not
merely
harvesting
but
also
sowing
and
dressing
are
forbidden
in
the
original
commandment
this
was
not
the
case
all
that
was
provided
for
was
that
in
the
seventh
year
the
harvest
should
not
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
proprietor
of
the
soil
but
should
be
a
relic
perhaps
of
communistic
agriculture
through
a
mere
misunderstanding
of
the
verbal
suffix
in
exodus
xxiii
as
has
been
conjectured
by
hupfeld
a
surrender
of
the
of
the
land
has
been
construed
into
a
surrender
of
tbe
land
itself
a
general
fallow
year
leviticus
xxv
the
misunderstanding
however
is
not
accidental
but
highly
characteristic
in
exodus
xxiii
the
arrangement
is
made
for
man
it
is
a
limitation
for
the
common
good
of
private
rights
of
property
in
land
in
fact
for
the
benefit
of
the
landless
who
in
the
seventh
year
are
to
have
the
usufruct
of
the
soil
in
leviticus
xxv
the
arrangement
is
for
the
sake
of
the
land
that
it
may
rest
if
not
on
the
seventh
day
at
least
on
the
seventh
year
and
for
the
sake
of
the
sabbath
that
it
may
extend
its
supremacy
over
nature
also
of
course
this
presupposes
the
extreme
degree
of
sabbath
observance
by
absolute
rest
and
becomes
comprehensible
only
when
viewed
as
an
outgrowth
from
that
for
the
rest
a
universal
fallow
season
is
possible
only
under
circumstances
in
which
a
people
are
to
a
considerable
extent
independent
of
the
products
of
their
own
agriculture
prior
to
the
exile
even
the
idea
of
such
a
thing
could
hardly
have
occurred
in
the
priestly
code
the
year
of
jubilee
is
further
added
to
supplement
in
turn
the
sabbatical
year
leviticus
xxv
as
the
latter
is
framed
to
correspond
with
the
seventh
day
so
the
former
corresponds
with
the
fiftieth
with
pentecost
as
is
easily
perceived
from
the
parallelism
of
leviticus
xxv
with
leviticus
xxiii
asthe
fiftieth
day
after
the
seven
sabbath
days
is
celebrated
as
a
closing
festival
of
the
days
period
so
is
the
fiftieth
year
after
the
seven
sabbatic
years
as
rounding
off
the
larger
interval
the
seven
sabbaths
falling
on
harvest
time
which
are
usually
reckoned
specially
luke
vi
have
in
the
circumstance
of
their
interrupting
harvest
work
a
particular
resemblance
to
the
sabbatic
years
which
interrupt
agriculture
altogether
jubilee
is
thus
an
artificial
institution
superimposed
upon
the
years
of
fallow
regarded
as
harvest
sabbaths
after
the
analogy
of
pentecost
both
its
functions
appear
originally
to
have
belonged
also
to
the
sabbath
year
and
to
be
deduced
from
the
two
corresponding
regulations
in
deuteronomy
relating
to
the
seventh
year
so
that
thus
exod
xxiii
would
be
the
basis
of
leviticus
xxv
and
deuteronomy
xv
that
of
xxv
seq
the
emancipation
of
the
hebrew
slave
originally
had
to
take
place
on
the
seventh
year
after
the
purchase
afterwards
it
would
seem
on
the
seventh
vear
absolutely
for
practical
reasons
it
was
transferred
from
that
to
the
fiftieth
analogous
also
doubtless
is
the
growth
of
the
other
element
in
the
jubilee
the
return
of
mortgaged
property
to
its
hereditary
owner
out
of
the
remission
of
debts
enjoined
in
deuteronomy
xv
for
the
end
of
the
seventh
year
for
the
two
hang
very
closely
together
as
leviticus
xxv
seq
shows
as
for
the
evidence
for
these
various
arrangements
those
of
the
book
of
the
covenant
are
presupposed
alike
by
deuteronomy
and
by
the
priestly
code
it
seems
to
have
been
due
to
the
prompting
of
deuteronomy
that
towards
the
end
of
the
reign
of
zedekiah
the
emancipation
of
the
hebrew
slaves
was
seriously
gone
about
the
expressions
in
jeremiah
xxxiv
point
to
deuteronomy
xv
and
not
to
exodus
xxi
the
injunction
not
having
had
practical
effect
previously
it
was
in
this
instance
carried
through
by
all
parties
at
the
same
date
this
was
of
course
inevitable
when
it
was
introduced
as
an
extraordinary
innovation
perhaps
it
is
in
connexion
with
this
that
a
fixed
seventh
year
grew
out
of
a
relative
one
the
sabbatical
year
according
to
the
own
declaration
was
never
observed
throughout
the
whole
period
for
according
to
leviticus
xxvi
the
desolation
of
the
land
during
the
exile
is
to
be
a
compensation
made
for
the
previously
neglected
fallow
years
then
shall
the
land
pay
its
sabbaths
as
long
as
it
lieth
desolate
when
ye
are
in
your
enemies
land
then
shall
the
land
rest
and
pay
its
sabbaths
all
the
days
that
it
lieth
desolate
shall
it
rest
which
it
rested
not
in
your
sabbaths
when
ye
dwelt
upon
it
the
verse
is
quoted
in
xxxvi
as
the
language
of
jeremiah
a
correct
and
unprejudiced
indication
of
its
exilic
origin
but
as
the
author
of
leviticus
xxvi
was
also
the
writer
of
leviticus
xxv
that
is
to
say
the
framer
of
the
law
of
the
sabbatic
year
the
recent
date
of
the
latter
regulation
also
follows
at
once
the
year
of
jubilee
certainly
derived
from
the
sabbath
year
is
of
still
later
origin
jeremiah
xxxiv
has
not
the
faintest
idea
that
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
must
according
to
law
take
place
in
the
fiftieth
year
the
name
drwr
borne
by
the
jubilee
in
leviticus
xxv
is
applied
by
him
to
the
seventh
year
and
this
is
decisive
also
for
ezekiel
xlvi
the
gift
of
land
bestowed
by
the
prince
on
one
of
his
servants
remains
in
his
possession
only
until
the
seventh
year
chapter
iv
the
priests
and
the
levites
the
problem
now
to
be
dealt
with
is
exhibited
with
peculiar
distinctness
in
one
pregnant
case
with
which
it
will
be
well
to
set
out
the
mosaic
law
that
is
to
say
the
priestly
code
distinguishes
as
is
well
known
between
the
twelve
secular
tribes
and
levi
and
further
within
the
spiritual
tribe
itself
between
the
sons
of
aaron
and
the
levites
simply
so
called
the
one
distinction
is
made
visible
in
the
ordering
of
the
camp
in
numbers
where
levi
forms
around
the
sanctuary
a
cordon
of
protection
against
the
immediate
contact
of
the
remaining
tribes
on
the
whole
however
it
is
rather
treated
as
a
matter
of
course
and
not
brought
into
special
prominence
numbers
xviii
the
other
is
accentuated
with
incomparably
greater
emphasis
aaron
and
his
sons
alone
are
priests
qualified
for
sacrificing
and
burning
incense
the
levites
are
hieroduli
esdras
i
bestowed
upon
the
aaronidae
for
the
discharge
of
the
inferior
services
numbers
iii
they
are
indeed
their
tribe
fellows
but
it
is
not
because
he
belongs
to
levi
that
aaron
is
chosen
and
his
priesthood
can
not
be
said
to
be
the
acme
and
flower
of
the
general
vocation
of
his
tribe
on
the
contrary
rather
was
he
a
priest
long
before
the
levites
were
set
apart
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
cultus
has
been
established
and
set
on
foot
these
do
not
make
any
appearance
not
at
all
in
the
whole
of
the
third
book
which
thus
far
does
little
honour
to
its
name
strictly
speaking
the
levites
do
not
even
belong
to
the
clergy
they
are
not
called
by
jehovah
but
consecrated
by
the
children
of
israel
to
the
sanctuary
consecrated
in
the
place
of
the
not
however
as
priests
neither
in
numbers
nor
anywhere
else
in
the
old
testament
is
there
a
single
trace
of
the
priesthood
of
the
but
as
a
gift
due
to
the
priests
as
such
being
even
required
to
undergo
the
usual
waving
before
the
altar
to
symbolise
their
being
cast
into
the
altar
flame
numbers
the
relationship
between
aaron
and
levi
and
the
circumstance
that
precisely
this
tribe
is
set
apart
for
the
sanctuary
in
compensation
for
the
appears
almost
accidental
but
at
all
events
can
not
be
explained
by
the
theory
that
aaron
rose
on
the
shoulders
of
levi
on
the
contrary
it
rather
means
that
levi
has
mounted
up
by
means
of
aaron
whose
priesthood
everywhere
is
treated
as
having
the
priority
equality
between
the
two
is
not
to
be
spoken
of
their
office
and
their
blood
relationship
separates
them
more
than
it
binds
them
together
now
the
prophet
ezekiel
in
the
plan
of
the
new
jerusalem
which
he
sketched
in
the
year
takes
up
among
other
things
the
reform
of
the
relations
of
the
of
the
temple
and
in
this
connection
expresses
himself
as
follows
xliv
thus
saith
the
lord
jehovah
let
it
suffice
you
of
all
your
abominations
o
house
of

in
that
ye
have
brought

strangers
uncircumcised

and
uncircumcised

to
be
in
my
sanctuary
to
pollute
it
even
my
house
when
ye
offer
my
bread
the
fat
and
the
blood
and
have
broken
my
covenant
by
all
your
abominations
and
ye
have
not
kept
the
charge
of
my
holy
things
inasmuch
as
ye
have

sanctuary
none
of
all
that
are
among
the
children
of

but
the
levites
who
went
away
far
from
me
when
israel
went
astray
from
me
after
their
idols
they
shall
even
bear
their
iniquity
and
they
shall

they
shall

they
ministered

come
near
to
any
of
my
holy
things
but
they
shall
bear
their
shame
and
their
abominations
which
they
have
committed
and
i
will
make
them
keepers
of
the
charge
of
the
house
for
all
its
service
and
for
all
that
shall
be
done
therein
but
the
priests
the
levites
sons
of
zadok
that
kept
the
charge
of
my
sanctuary
when
the
children
of
israel
went
astray
from
me
they
shall
come
near
to
me
to
minister
unto
me
and
they
shall
stand
before
me
to
offer
unto
me
the
fat
and
the
blood
saith
the
lord
jehovah
they
shall
enter
into
my
sanctuary
and
come
near
to
my
table
to
minister
unto
me
and
they
shall
keep
my
charge
from
this
passage
two
things
are
to
be
learned
first
that
the
systematic
separation
of
that
which
was
holy
from
profane
contact
did
not
exist
from
the
very
beginning
that
in
the
temple
of
solomon
even
heathen
zech
xiv
probably
captives
were
employed
to
do
hierodulic
services
which
according
to
the
law
ought
to
have
been
rendered
by
levites
and
which
afterwards
actually
were
so
rendered
ezekiel
it
is
indeed
true
holds
this
custom
to
be
a
frightful
abuse
and
one
might
therefore
maintain
it
to
have
been
a
breach
of
the
temple
ordinances
suffered
by
the
jerusalem
priests
against
their
better
knowledge
and
in
this
way
escape
accusing
them
of
ignorance
of
their
own
law
but
the
second
fact
made
manifest
by
the
passage
quite
excludes
the
existence
of
the
priestly
code
so
far
as
ezekiel
and
his
time
are
concerned
the
place
of
the
heathen
is
in
future
to
be
taken
by
the
levites
hitherto
the
latter
had
held
the
priesthood
and
that
too
not
by
arbitrary
usurpation
but
in
virtue
of
their
oun
good
right
for
it
is
no
mere
relegation
back
to
within
the
limits
of
their
lawful
position
when
they
are
made
to
be
no
longer
priests
but
temple
ministrants
it
is
no
restoration
of
the
quo
the
conditions
of
which
they
had
illegally
broken
it
is
expressly
a
degradation
a
withdrawal
of
their
right
which
appears
as
a
punishment
and
which
must
be
justified
as
being
deserved
they
shall
bear
their
iniquity
they
have
forfeited
their
priesthood
by
abusing
it
to
preside
over
the
cultus
of
the
high
places
which
the
prophet
regards
as
idolatry
and
hates
in
his
inmost
soul
naturally
those
levites
are
exempted
from
the
penalty
who
have
discharged
their
functions
at
the
legal
place
the
levites
the
sons
of
zadok
namely
at
jerusalem
who
now
remain
sole
priests
and
receive
a
position
of
above
those
who
hitherto
have
been
their
equals
in
office
and
who
are
still
associated
with
them
by
ezekiel
under
the
same
common
name
but
now
are
reduced
to
being
their
assistants
and
hieroduli
it
is
an
extraordinary
sort
of
justice
when
the
priests
of
the
abolished
bamoth
are
punished
simply
for
having
been
so
and
conversely
the
priests
of
the
temple
at
jerusalem
rewarded
for
this
the
fault
of
the
former
and
the
merit
of
the
latter
consist
simply
in
their
existence
in
other
words
ezekiel
merely
drapes
the
logic
of
facts
with
a
mantle
of
morality
from
the
abolition
of
the
popular
sanctuaries
in
the
provinces
in
favour
of
the
royal
one
at
jerusalem
there
necessarily
followed
the
setting
aside
of
the
provincial
priesthoods
in
favour
of
the
sons
of
zadok
at
the
temple
of
solomon
the
original
author
of
the
centralisation
the
deuteronomic
lawgiver
seeks
indeed
to
prevent
this
consequence
by
giving
to
the
extraneous
levites
an
equal
right
of
sacrificing
in
jerusalem
with
their
brethren
hereditarily
settled
there
but
it
was
not
possible
to
separate
the
fate
of
the
priests
from
that
of
their
altars
in
this
manner
the
sons
of
zadok
were
well
enough
pleased
that
all
sacrifices
should
be
concentrated
within
their
temple
but
they
did
not
see
their
way
to
sharing
their
inheritance
with
the
priesthood
of
the
high
places
and
the
idea
was
not
carried
out
xxiii
ezekiel
a
thorough
jerusalemite
finds
a
moral
way
of
putting
this
departure
from
the
law
a
way
of
putting
it
which
does
not
explain
the
fact
but
is
merely
a
periphrastic
statement
of
it
with
deuteronomy
as
a
basis
it
is
quite
easy
to
understand
ezekiel
ordinance
but
it
is
absolutely
impossible
if
one
starts
from
the
priestly
code
what
he
regards
as
the
original
right
of
the
levites
the
performance
of
priestly
services
is
treated
in
the
latter
document
as
an
unfounded
and
highly
wicked
pretension
which
once
in
the
olden
times
brought
destruction
upon
korah
and
his
company
what
he
considers
to
be
a
subsequent
withdrawal
of
their
right
as
a
degradation
in
consequence
of
a
fault
the
other
holds
to
have
been
their
hereditary
and
natural
destination
the
distinction
between
priest
and
levite
which
ezekiel
introduces
and
justifies
as
an
innovation
according
to
the
priestly
code
has
always
existed
what
in
the
former
appears
as
a
beginning
in
the
latter
has
been
in
force
ever
since
moses
an
original
datum
not
a
thing
that
has
become
or
been
that
the
prophet
should
know
if
by
reason
of
their
birth
it
was
impossible
for
the
levites
to
become
priests
then
it
would
be
more
than
strange
to
deprive
them
of
the
priesthood
on
account
of
their
faults
much
as
if
one
were
to
threaten
the
commons
with
the
punishment
of
disqualification
to
sit
or
vote
in
a
house
of
lords
kuenen
theol
iii
nothing
about
a
priestly
law
with
whose
tendencies
he
is
in
thorough
sympathy
admits
of
only
one
explanation
that
it
did
not
then
exist
his
own
ordinances
are
only
to
be
understood
as
preparatory
steps
towards
its
own
exactment
noldeke
however
interprets
the
parallelism
between
the
sons
of
aaron
and
the
sons
of
zadok
in
favour
of
the
priority
of
the
priestly
code
which
after
all
he
points
out
is
not
quite
so
exclusive
as
ezekiel
but
in
the
first
place
this
is
a
jahrb
prot
its
doctrine
that
the
aaronidae
alone
are
true
priests
has
its
parallel
in
ezekiel
who
more
recognises
only
the
sons
of
zadok
as
priests
point
of
subordinate
importance
the
main
thing
being
that
ezekiel
has
to
make
the
distinction
between
priests
and
levites
which
is
regarded
in
the
priestly
code
as
very
ancient
in
presence
of
the
fact
that
the
former
introduces
as
a
new
thing
the
separation
which
the
latter
presupposes
the
precise
degree
of
the
distinction
drawn
by
the
two
is
of
no
consequence
whatever
in
the
next
place
to
bring
the
sons
of
aaron
into
comparison
with
the
sons
of
zadok
as
a
proof
of
their
higher
antiquity
is
just
as
reasonable
as
to
bring
the
tabernacle
into
comparison
with
the
temple
of
jerusalem
for
a
similar
purpose
the
former
are
priests
of
the
tabernacle
the
latter
of
the
temple
but
as
in
point
of
fact
the
only
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
the
mosaic
and
the
actual
central
sanctuary
is
that
between
shadow
and
substance
so
neither
can
any
other
be
made
between
the
mosaic
and
the
actual
central
priesthood
in
the
priestly
code
the
ancient
name
is
introduced
instead
of
the
historical
one
simply
in
order
to
maintain
the
semblance
of
the
mosaic
time
if
the
circumstance
is
to
be
taken
as
betokening
the
earlier
origin
of
the
work
then
a
similar
inference
must
be
drawn
also
from
the
fact
that
in
it
the
origin
and
character
of
the
levites
is
quite
obscure
while
in
ezekiel
it
is
palpably
evident
that
they
are
the
priests
thrown
out
of
employment
by
the
abolition
of
the
bamoth
whom
necessity
has
compelled
to
take
a
position
of
subordination
under
their
haughty
at
jerusalem
in
truth
it
is
quite
on
the
contrary
a
proof
of
the
date
of
the
priestly
code
that
it
makes
sons
of
aaron
of
the
priests
of
the
central
sanctuary
who
even
in
the
traditional
understanding
xiii
are
in
one
way
or
other
simply
the
priests
of
jerusalem
by
this
means
it
carries
their
origin
back
to
the
foundation
of
the
theocracy
and
gives
them
out
as
from
the
first
having
been
alone
legitimate
but
such
an
idea
no
one
could
have
ventured
to
broach
before
the
exile
at
that
time
it
was
too
well
known
that
the
priesthood
of
the
jerusalem
sept
could
not
be
traced
further
back
than
david
time
but
dated
from
zadok
who
in
solomon
reign
ousted
the
hereditary
house
of
eli
from
the
position
it
had
long
previously
held
first
at
shiloh
and
nob
and
afterwards
at
jerusalem
at
what
had
become
the
most
prominent
sanctuary
of
israel
in
a
passage
of
deuteronomic
complexion
which
can
not
have
been
written
long
before
the
exile
we
read
in
a
prediction
made
to
eli
regarding
the
overthrow
of
his
house
by
zadok
i
said
indeed
saith
jehovah
the
god
of
israel
that
thy
house
and
the
house
of
thy
father
shall
walk
before
me
for
ever
but
now
i
say
be
it
far
from
me
for
them
that
honour
me
i
will
honour
but
they
that
despise
me
shall
be
lightly
esteemed
behold
the
days
come
that
i
will
cut
off
thine
arm
and
the
arm
of
thy
father
house
and
i
will
raise
up
for
myself
a
faithful
priest
who
shall
do
according
to
what
is
in
my
heart
and
in
my
mind
and
i
will
build
him
a
sure
house
and
he
shall
walk
before
mine
anointed
for
ever
ii
here
it
is
the
house
of
eli
and
of
eli
father
that
is
the
priestly
family
duly
chosen
in
egypt
to
hereditary
title
and
contrary
to
a
promise
of
perpetual
continuance
is
it
deposed
at
the
higher
claims
of
justice
the
faithful
priest
who
is
to
fill
the
vacant
place
is
zadok
this
is
expressly
said
in
and
no
other
than
he
ever
had
a
sure
house
and
walked
uninterruptedly
as
its
head
and
ruler
before
the
kings
of
judah
this
zadok
accordingly
belongs
neither
to
eli
house
nor
to
that
of
eli
father
his
priesthood
does
not
go
back
as
far
as
the
time
of
the
founding
of
the
theocracy
and
is
not
in
any
proper
sense
legitimate
rather
has
he
obtained
it
by
the
infringement
of
what
might
be
called
a
constitutional
privilege
to
which
there
were
no
other
heirs
besides
eli
and
his
family
obviously
he
does
not
figure
as
an
intermediate
link
in
the
line
of
aaron
but
as
the
beginner
of
an
entirely
new
genealogy
the
jerusalem
priests
whose
ancestor
he
is
are
interlopers
dating
from
the
beginning
of
the
monarchical
period
in
whom
the
old
mosaic
is
not
continued
but
is
broken
off
if
then
they
are
called
in
the
priestly
code
sons
of
aaron
or
at
least
figure
there
among
the
sons
of
aaron
with
whom
they
can
only
in
point
of
fact
be
contrasted
the
circumstance
is
an
unmistakable
indication
that
at
this
point
the
threads
of
tradition
from
the
period
have
been
snapped
completely
which
was
not
yet
the
case
in
ezekiel
time
to
satisfy
the
pentateuch
it
is
shown
in
the
book
of
chronicles
by
means
of
artificial
genalogies
how
the
sons
of
zadok
derived
their
origin
in
an
unbroken
line
from
aaron
and
eleazar
compare
my
pharisaer
sadducaer
seq
this
point
was
first
observed
by
vatke
seq
then
by
kuenen
theol
iii
and
lastly
by
me
text
der
bb
the
relation
between
the
priestly
legislation
and
the
book
of
ezekiel
which
has
now
been
shown
gives
direction
and
aim
to
the
following
sketch
in
which
it
is
sought
to
exhibit
the
individual
phenomenon
in
its
general
connection
the
setting
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
people
of
an
entire
tribe
as
holy
and
the
strongly
accentuated
distinction
of
ranks
within
that
tribe
presuppose
a
highly
systematised
separation
between
sacred
and
profane
and
an
elaborate
machinery
connected
with
cultus
in
fact
according
to
the
representation
given
in
the
priestly
code
the
israelites
from
the
beginning
were
organised
as
a
hierocracy
the
clergy
being
the
skeleton
the
high
priest
the
head
and
the
tabernacle
the
heart
but
the
suddenness
with
which
this
hierocracy
descended
on
the
wilderness
from
the
skies
is
only
matched
by
the
suddenness
with
which
it
afterwards
disappeared
in
canaan
leaving
no
trace
behind
it
in
the
time
of
the
judges
priests
and
levites
and
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
assembled
around
them
have
utterly
vanished
there
is
hardly
a
israel
only
individual
tribes
which
do
not
combine
even
under
the
most
pressing
necessities
far
less
support
at
a
common
expense
a
clerical
numbering
thousands
of
men
besides
their
wives
and
families
instead
of
the
ecclesiastical
history
of
the
hexateuch
the
book
of
judges
forthwith
enters
upon
a
secular
history
completely
devoid
of
all
churchly
character
the
high
priest
who
according
to
the
priestly
code
is
the
central
authority
by
the
grace
of
god
is
here
quite
left
out
in
the
cold
for
the
really
acting
heads
of
the
people
are
the
judges
people
of
an
entirely
different
stamp
whose
authority
resting
on
no
official
position
but
on
strength
of
personality
and
on
the
force
of
circumstances
seldom
extends
beyond
the
limits
of
their
tribe
and
it
is
plain
that
in
this
we
behold
not
the
sorry
remains
of
an
system
once
flourishing
under
moses
and
joshua
now
completely
fallen
into
ruins
but
the
first
natural
beginnings
of
a
civil
authority
which
after
a
course
of
further
development
finally
led
to
the
monarchy
in
the
kernel
of
the
book
of
judges
chaps
there
nowhere
occurs
a
single
individual
whose
profession
is
to
take
charge
of
the
cultus
sacrifice
is
in
two
instances
offered
by
gideon
and
manoah
but
in
neither
case
is
a
priest
held
to
be
necessary
in
a
gloss
upon
vi
seq
the
divergence
of
later
custom
reveals
itself
when
the
ark
of
jehovah
was
brought
back
from
exile
in
philistia
upon
the
new
cart
it
halted
in
the
field
of
bethshemesh
beside
the
great
stone
and
the
inhabitants
of
bethshemesh
who
were
at
the
time
busy
with
the
wheat
harvest
broke
up
the
cart
and
made
on
the
stone
a
of
the
kine
by
which
it
had
been
drawn
after
they
have
finished
the
levites
come
up
ver
in
the
pluperfect
tense
and
proceed
as
if
nothing
had
happened
lift
the
ark
from
the
now
no
longer
existent
cart
and
set
it
upon
the
stone
on
which
the
sacrifice
is
already
burning
of
course
only
in
order
to
fulfil
the
law
the
demands
of
which
have
been
completely
ignored
in
the
original
narrative
until
the
cultus
has
become
in
some
measure
centralised
the
priests
have
no
for
when
each
man
sacrifices
for
himself
and
his
household
upon
an
altar
which
he
improvises
as
best
he
can
for
the
passing
need
where
is
the
occasion
for
people
whose
professional
and
essential
function
is
that
of
sacrificing
for
others
the
circumstance
of
their
being
thus
inconspicuous
in
the
earliest
period
of
the
history
of
israel
is
connected
with
the
fact
that
as
yet
there
are
few
great
sanctuaries
but
as
soon
as
these
begin
to
occur
the
priests
immediately
appear
thus
we
find
eli
and
his
sons
at
the
old
house
of
god
belonging
to
the
tribe
of
ephraim
at
shiloh
eli
holds
a
very
exalted
position
his
sons
are
depicted
as
high
and
mighty
men
who
deal
with
the
worshippers
not
directly
but
through
a
servant
and
show
arrogant
disregard
of
their
duties
to
jehovah
the
office
is
hereditary
and
the
priesthood
already
very
numerous
at
least
in
the
time
of
saul
after
they
had
migrated
from
shiloh
to
nob
on
account
of
the
destruction
by
the
philistines
of
the
temple
at
the
former
place
they
numbered
more
than
men
who
however
are
not
necessarily
proper
of
eli
although
reckoning
themselves
as
belonging
to
his
clan
xxii
in
i
indeed
we
read
only
of
eli
and
his
two
sons
and
one
servant
and
even
david
and
solomon
appear
to
have
had
only
a
priest
or
two
at
the
chief
temple
are
we
to
suppose
that
doeg
could
have
made
away
with
men
one
sanctuary
more
is
referred
to
towards
the
close
of
the
period
of
the
judges
that
at
dan
beside
the
source
of
the
jordan
a
rich
ephraimite
micah
had
set
up
to
jehovah
a
image
and
lodged
it
in
an
appropriate
house
at
first
he
appointed
one
of
his
sons
to
be
its
priest
afterwards
jonathan
ben
gershom
ben
moses
a
homeless
levite
of
whom
he
counted
himself
happy
in
being
able
to
retain
for
a
yearly
salary
of
ten
pieces
of
silver
besides
clothing
and
maintenance
when
however
the
danites
hard
pressed
by
the
philistines
removed
from
their
ancient
settlements
in
order
to
establish
a
new
home
for
themselves
on
the
slopes
of
hermon
in
the
north
they
in
passing
carried
off
both
micah
image
and
his
priest
what
led
them
to
do
so
was
the
report
of
their
spies
who
had
formerly
lodged
with
micah
and
there
obtained
an
oracle
it
was
in
this
way
that
jonathan
came
to
dan
and
became
the
founder
of
the
family
which
retained
the
priesthood
at
this
afterwards
so
important
sanctuary
down
to
the
period
of
the
deportation
of
the
danites
at
the
assyrian
captivity
judges
his
position
seems
very
different
from
that
of
eli
the
only
point
of
resemblance
is
that
both
are
hereditary
priests
levites
so
called
and
trace
their
descent
from
the
family
of
moses
of
which
more
anon
but
while
eli
is
a
man
of
distinction
perhaps
the
owner
of
the
sanctuary
at
all
events
in
a
position
of
thorough
independence
and
the
head
of
a
great
house
jonathan
is
a
solitary
wandering
levite
who
enters
the
service
of
the
proprietor
of
a
sanctuary
for
pay
and
maintenance
and
is
indeed
nourished
as
a
son
by
his
patron
but
by
no
means
treated
with
special
respect
by
the
danites
the
latter
case
it
may
well
be
conjectured
more
nearly
represents
the
normal
state
of
matters
than
the
former
an
independent
and
influential
priesthood
could
develop
itself
only
at
the
larger
and
more
public
centres
of
worship
but
that
of
shiloh
seems
to
have
been
the
only
one
of
this
class
the
remaining
houses
of
god
of
which
we
hear
some
word
from
the
transition
period
which
preceded
the
monarchy
are
not
of
importance
and
are
in
private
hands
thus
corresponding
to
that
of
micah
on
mount
ephraim
that
of
ophra
belongs
to
gideon
and
that
of
kirjathjearim
to
abinadab
in
fact
it
appears
that
micah
in
appointing
one
to
minister
at
his
sanctuary
for
hire
would
seem
to
have
followed
a
more
general
practice
for
the
expression
ml
ydw
which
still
survived
as
a
for
the
ordination
of
priests
long
after
they
had
attained
a
perfectly
independent
position
can
originally
in
this
connection
hardly
have
meant
anything
else
than
a
filling
of
the
hand
with
money
or
its
equivalent
thus
the
priestly
office
would
appear
in
the
older
time
to
have
been
a
paid
one
perhaps
the
only
one
that
was
paid
whom
he
shall
appoint
is
at
the
discretion
of
the
proprietor
if
no
one
else
is
available
he
gives
it
to
one
of
his
sons
judges
xvii
vii
of
a
character
indelibilis
there
is
of
course
in
such
a
case
no
idea
as
one
can
learn
from
the
earliest
example
in
which
micah
son
retires
again
from
the
service
after
a
brief
interval
david
when
he
removed
the
ark
intrusted
it
in
the
first
instance
to
the
house
of
obededom
a
captain
of
his
a
philistine
of
gath
whom
he
made
its
keeper
a
priest
of
regular
calling
a
levite
is
according
to
judges
xvii
a
very
unusual
person
to
find
at
an
ordinary
sanctuary
even
at
shiloh
where
however
the
conditions
are
extraordinary
the
privilege
of
the
sons
of
eli
is
not
an
exclusive
one
samuel
who
is
not
a
member
of
the
family
is
nevertheless
adopted
as
a
priest
the
service
for
which
a
stated
minister
was
needed
was
not
that
of
offering
sacrifice
this
was
not
so
regular
an
occurrence
as
not
to
admit
of
being
attended
to
by
one
self
for
a
simple
altar
no
priest
was
required
but
only
for
a
house
which
contained
a
sacred
image
byt
lhym
house
of
god
is
never
anything
but
the
house
of
an
image
outside
of
the
priestly
code
is
the
image
the
priestly
garment
this
demanded
watching
and
attendance
sam
vii
in
fact
an
ephod
like
that
of
gideon
or
that
of
micah
judges
viii
xvii
was
an
article
well
worth
stealing
and
the
houses
of
god
ordinarily
lay
in
an
open
place

the
expressions
mr
and

to
denote
the
sacred
service
were
retained
in
use
from
this
period
to
later
times
and
while
every
one
knows
how
to
sacrifice
the
art
of
dealing
with
the
ephod
and
winning
its
oracle
from
it
continues
from
time
immemorial
to
be
the
exclusive
secret
of
the

compare
now
with
this
simple
state

affairs
the
fact
that
in

code
the

have
something
like
the
half
of
a
total
of
levites
to
assist
them
as
watchers

ministers

any
one
may
slaughter

offer

xiv

and
even
in
cases
where
priests
are
present
there
is
not
a
single
trace
of
a
systematic
setting
apart
of
what
is
holy
or
of
shrinking
from
touching
it
when
david
entered
into
the
house
of
god
and
did
eat
the
which
it
is
not
lawful
to
eat
save
for
the
priests

gave
also
to
them
that

this
is
not

in

so

is
observed
by

quietly
as

his
wont
on
his
seat
at

the
history
of
the
ark
particularly
as
vatke
justly
remarks

affords
more
than
one
proof
of
the
fact
that
the
notion
of
the
unapproachableness
of
the
holy
was
quite
unknown
i
shall
content
myself
with
the
most
striking
of
these
samuel
the
ephraimite
sleeps
by
virtue
of
his
office
every
night
beside
the
ark
of
jehovah
a
place
whither
according
to
leviticus
the
high
priest
may
come
only
once
in
the
year
and
even
he
only
after
the
strictest
preparation
and
with
the
most
elaborate
atoning
rites
the
contrast
in
the
tone
of
feeling
is
so
great
that
no
one
as
yet
has
even
ventured
to
realise
it
clearly
to
himself
with
the
commencement
of
the
monarchical
period
the
priests
forthwith
begin
to
come
into
greater
prominence
along
with
the
kings
the
advance
in
centralisation
and
in
publicity
of
life
makes
itself
noticeable
also
in
the
department
of
worship
at
the
beginning
of
saul
reign
we
find
the
distinguished
ephraimitic
priesthood
the
house
of
eli
no
longer
at
shiloh
but
at
nob
in
the
vicinity
of
the
king
and
to
a
certain
degree
in
league
with
him
for
their
head
ahijah
the
priest
is
in
immediate
attendance
on
him
when
arms
are
first
raised
against
the
phiiistines
shares
the
danger
with
him
and
consults
the
ephod
on
his
behalf
subsequently
the
was
disturbed
ahijah
and
his
brethren
fell
a
sacrifice
to
the
king
jealousy
and
thus
the
solitary
instance
of
an
independent
and
considerable
priesthood
to
be
met
with
in
the
old
history
of
israel
came
for
ever
to
an
end
abiathar
who
alone
escaped
the
massacre
of
nob
xxii
fled
with
the
ephod
to
david
for
which
he
was
rewarded
afterwards
with
high
honours
but
all
that
he
became
he
became
as
servant
of
david
under
david
the
regius
priesthood
began
to
grow
towards
the
importance
which
it
from
that
time
forward
had
this
king
exercised
unfettered
control
over
the
sanctuary
of
the
ark
which
stood
in
his
citadel
as
also
over
the
appointment
of
the
priests
who
were
merely
his
officials
alongside
of
abiathar
he
placed
zadok
and
subsequently
ira
also
as
well
as
some
of
his
own
sons
for
when
it
is
stated
in
viii
that
the
sons
of
david
were
priests
the
words
must
not
out
of
regard
to
the
pentateuch
be
twisted
so
as
to
mean
something
different
from
what
they
say
we
also
iv
find
the
son
of
the
prophet
nathan
figuring
as
a
priest
and
on
the
other
hand
the
son
of
zadok
holding
a
high
secular
office
ver
even
at
this
date
the
line
of
demarcation
afterwards
drawn
between
holy
and
persons
has
no
existence
what
under
david
was
still
wanting
to
the
institution
of
the
royal
worship
and
the
regius
priests
a
fixed
centre
was
added
by
the
erection
of
the
temple
under
his
successor
at
the
beginning
of
solomon
reign
there
was
still
no
israelite
place
of
sacrifice
such
as
sufficed
for
the
greater
contingencies
he
was
compelled
to
celebrate
his
accession
at
the
great
bamah
at
gibeon
a
town
in
the
neighbourhood
of
jerusalem
which
although
it
had
been
subjugated
for
a
considerable
time
was
still
entirely
canaanite
he
now
took
care
to
make
it
possible
that
his
colossal
festivals
should
be
celebrated
at
his
own
sanctuary
and
next
he
made
zadok
its
priest
after
having
previously
deposed
and
relegated
to
his
patrimonial
property
at
anathoth
a
village
adjoining
jerusalem
the
aged
abiathar
a
man
of
pure
and
honourable
priestly
descent
on
account
of
the
support
he
had
given
to
the
legitimate
heir
to
the
crown
thereby
bringing
to
pass
the
fate
with
which
the
once
so
proud
and
powerful
family
of
eli
had
in
ii
been
threatened
doubtless
other
priests
also
by
degrees
attached
themselves
to
the
family
of
zadok
and
ultimately
came
even
to
call
themselves
his
sons
just
as
the
rechabites
regarded
jonathan
ben
rechab
or
the
children
of
the
prophets
one
or
other
of
the
great
prophets
as
their
father
regarding
their
sanctuaries
as
their
own
private
property
precisely
as
micah
does
in
the
classical
instance
recorded
in
judges
and
proceeding
quite
untrammelled
in
the
appointment
and
removal
of
the
officials
employed
neither
do
these
early
kings
hesitate
in
the
least
to
exercise
personally
the
rights
which
had
emanated
from
themselves
and
been
delegated
to
others
of
saul
who
indeed
was
in
the
habit
of
delegating
but
seldom
and
of
doing
with
his
own
hand
all
that
required
to
be
done
it
is
several
times
mentioned
that
he
sacrificed
in
person
and
it
is
clear
that
this
is
not
brought
as
a
charge
against
him
in
xiv
and
xv
david
sacrificed
on
the
occasion
of
his
having
successfully
brought
the
ark
to
jerusalem
that
it
was
he
himself
who
officiated
appears
from
the
fact
that
he
wore
the
priestly
ephod
ephod
and
at
the
close
of
the
offering
pronounced
the
benediction
vi
in
the
same
way
was
the
consecration
of
the
temple
conducted
by
solomon
it
was
he
who
went
before
the
altar
and
after
praying
there
upon
his
knees
with
outstretched
arms
rose
and
blessed
the
people
viii
doubtless
also
it
was
he
who
with
his
own
hands
offered
the
first
sacrifice
the
priests
technical
skill
is
necessary
only
for
inquiring
of
the
oracle
before
the
ephod
xiv
these
beginnings
are
continued
in
the
history
of
the
priesthood
after
the
division
of
the
kingdom
jeroboam
the
founder
of
the
kingdom
of
israel
is
treated
by
the
historian
as
the
founder
also
of
israel
worship
in
so
far
as
the
latter
differed
from
the
judaean
ideal
he
made
the
two
calves
of
gold
and
set
them
up
at
bethel
and
at
dan
he
made
the
and
made
priests
from
the
mass
of
the
people
who
were
not
of
the
sons
of
levi
and
ordained
a
feast
in
the
eighth
month
and
ascended
to
the
altar
to
burn
incense
xii
xiii
here
indeed
after
the
manner
of
pious
pragmatism
retrospective
validity
is
given
to
the
deuteronomic
law
which
did
not
come
into
force
until
three
centuries
afterwards
and
judgment
is
thus
passed
in
accordance
with
a
historically
inadmissable
standard
moreover
the
facts
on
which
the
judgment
is
based
are
on
the
one
hand
too
much
generalised
and
on
the
other
hand
laid
too
exclusively
to
the
charge
of
jeroboam
the
first
king
bears
the
weight
of
all
the
sins
in
worship
of
all
his
successors
and
of
the
whole
body
of
the
people
but
the
recognition
of
the
sovereign
priesthood
of
the
ruler
of
the
formative
influence
which
he
exercised
over
the
worship
is
just
the
most
important
temples
were
royal
ones
and
the
priests
who
attended
at
them
were
the
king
priests
amos
vii
when
therefore
jehu
overthrew
the
house
of
ahab
he
did
not
extirpate
all
its
members
merely
and
its
officials
and
courtiers
but
also
its
priests
as
well
they
too
were
servants
of
the
crown
and
in
positions
of
trust
x
comp
iv
the
statement
that
they
were
chosen
at
the
pleasure
of
the
king
is
therefore
to
be
taken
as
implying
that
as
in
david
and
solomon
time
so
also
later
they
could
and
might
be
chosen
at
pleasure
on
the
other
hand
in
point
of
fact
the
sacred
office
in
dan
at
least
continued
from
the
period
of
the
judges
down
to
the
assyrian
deportation
hereditary
in
the
family
of
jonathan
one
must
moreover
avoid
imagining
that
all
the
houses
of
the
high
places
and
all
the
priestly
posts
belonged
to
the
king
it
was
impossible
that
the
the
parallelism
between
and
a
priestly
appointment
in
xii
seems
not
to
be
casual
merely
whilst
a
bamah
may
be
a
simple
altar
a
presupposes
a
divine
image
and
renders
an
necessary
government
should
be
so
in
such
matters
at
this
period
most
of
the
sanctuaries
were
public
but
not
therefore
as
yet
on
that
account
royal
and
so
also
doubtless
there
were
numerous
priests
who
were
not
servants
of
the
king
the
preponderance
of
official
cultus
and
of
an
official
personnel
to
carry
it
on
was
counteracted
in
the
northern
kingdom
by
the
frequent
dynastic
changes
and
the
unattached
particularism
of
the
separate
tribes
the
conditions
may
be
presumed
to
have
developed
themselves
with
great
variety
and
freedom
hereditary
and
unhereditary
priests
priests
with
independent
benefices
and
others
in
complete
poverty
subsisting
side
by
side
the
variety
and
the
equality
of
rights
enjoyed
by
all
is
the
distinguishing
mark
of
the
time
speaking
generally
however
the
priesthood
has
distinctly
consolidated
itself
as
compared
with
its
former
condition
and
gained
not
a
little
alike
in
number
and
in
influence
it
has
become
an
important
power
in
public
life
without
which
the
nation
can
not
be
imagined
it
would
perhaps
be
somewhat
bold
to
assert
this
on
the
strength
merely
of
the
brief
and
inadequate
indications
in
the
book
of
kings
which
is
chiefly
interested
in
the
extraordinary
interventions
of
the
prophets
in
the
course
of
israel
history
but
other
and
more
authentic
testimonies

deuteronomy
xxxiii
in
this
passage
the
priests
appear
as
a
strictly
close
corporation
so
close
that
they
are
mentioned
only
exceptionally
in
the
plural
number
and
for
the
most
part
are
spoken
of
collectively
in
the
singular
as
an
organic
unity
which
embraces
not
merely
the
contemporary
members
but
also
their
ancestors
and
which
begins
its
life
with
moses
the
friend
of
jehovah
who
as
its
beginning
is
identified
with
the
continuation
just
as
the
man
is
identified
with
the
child
out
of
which
he
has
grown
the
history
of
moses
is
at
the
same
time
the
history
of
the
priests
the
urim
and
thummim
belong
one
is
not
quite
sure
to
which
but
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
every
priest
to
whom
the
care
of
an
ephod
has
been
intrusted
interrogates
before
it
the
sacred
oracle
the
first
relative
clause
relating
to
moses
passes
over
without
change
of
subject
into
one
that
refers
to
the
priests
so
that
the
singular
immediately
falls
into
plural
and
the
plural
back
to
the
singular
yet
this
so
strongly
marked
solidarity
of
the
priesthood
as
a
profession
rests
by
no
means
upon
the
natural
basis
of
family
or
clan
unity
it
is
not
blood
but
on
the
contrary
the
abnegation
of
blood
that
constitutes
the
priest
as
is
brought
out
with
great
emphasis
he
must
act
for
jehovah
sake
as
if
he
had
neither
father
nor
mother
neither
brethren
nor
children
blind
prepossession
in
people
conceptions
of
judaism
has
hitherto
prevented
the
understanding
of
these
words
but
they
are
thoroughly
unambiguous
what
they
say
is
that
in
consecrating
himself
to
the
service
of
jehovah
a
man
abandons
his
natural
relationships
and
severs
himself
from
family
ties
thus
with
the
brotherhood
of
the
priests
in
northern
israel
the
case
is
precisely
similar
as
with
that
of
the
religious
guilds
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
the
rechabites
and
doubtless
too
the
nazarites
amos
ii
seq
also
native
there
whosoever
chose
or
whomsoever
he
chose
was
made
priest
by
jeroboam
such
is
the
expression
of
the
deuteronomic
redactor
of
the
book
of
kings
xiii
a
historical
example
of
what
has
been
said
is
afforded
by
the
young
samuel
as
he
figures
in
the
narrative
of
his
early
years
contained
in
a
narrative
which
certainly
reflects
the
condition
of
things
in
ephraim
at
the
period
of
the
monarchy
the
child
of
a
middle
class
family
at
ramah
in
the
district
of
zuph
ephraim
he
is
even
before
his
birth
vowed
to
jehovah
by
his
mother
and
as
soon
as
possible
afterwards
is
handed
over
to
the
sanctuary
at
shiloh
not
to
become
a
nazarite
or
one
of
the
nethinim
in
the
sense
of
the
pentateuch
but
to
be
a
priest
for
in
his
ministry
he
wears
the
linen
ephod

and
even
the
pallium

and
it
is
made
very
plain
that
comp
koran

i
vow
to
thee
that
which
is
in
my
womb
as
a
devotee
of
the
mosque

rectangular

or

among
the
greeks

by

the

in
thus

her
son
who
is
properly
hers

as
she
expresses
it
lending
him
to
jehovah
for
ever
i
mw
l
is
regarded
as
a
renunciation
of
family
rights
the
circumstance
that
it
is
by
the
parents
and
not
by
samuel
himself
that
the
consecration
is
made
makes
no
material
difference
the
one
thing
is
on
the
same
plane
with
the
other
and
doubtless
occurred
as
well
as
the
other
although
seldomer
but
on
the
other
hand
it
can
hardly
have
been
the
rule
that
any
one
should
abandon
not
parents
and
brethren
merely
but
also
wife
and
children
as
well
in
order
to
enter
the
priesthood
in
deuteronomy
xxxiii
this
is
adduced
only
as
an
extreme
instance
of
the
spirit
of
in
any
case
it
is
not
to
be
inferred
that
celibacy
was
demanded
but
only
that
the
priestly
office
was
often
barely
sufficient
to
support
the
man
not
to
speak
of
a
family
so
fixed
and
influential
so
independent
and
exclusive
had
the
priesthood
become
at
the
date
of
the
composition
of
the
blessing
of
moses
that
it
takes
a
place
of
its
own
alongside
of
the
tribes
of
the
nation
is
itself
a
tribe
constituted
however
not
by
blood
but
by
community
of
spiritual
interests
its
importance
is
brought
into
clearness
even
by
the
opposition
which
it
encounters
and
which
occasions
so
vigorous
a
denunciation
of
its
enemies
that
one
might
well
believe
the
person
who
committed
it
to
writing
to
have
been
himself
a
priest
the
cause
of
the
hostility
is
not
stated
but
it
seems
to
be
directed
simply
against
the
very
existence
of
a
professional
and
firmly
organised
clergy
and
to
proceed
from
laymen
who
hold
fast
by
the
rights
of
the
old
priestless
days
next
to
the
blessing
of
moses
the
discourses
of
hosea
contain
our
most
important
materials
for
an
estimate
of
the
priesthood
of
northern
israel
how
important
that
institution
was
for
public
life
is
clear
from
his
expressions
also
the
priests
are
the
spiritual
leaders
of
the
people
the
reproach
that
they
do
not
fulfil
their
high
vocation
proves
in
the
first
place
that
they
have
it
degenerate
they
are
to
be
sure
in
hosea
representation
they
are
seen
in
the
same
light
as
that
in
which
the
sons
of
eli
appear
as
described
in
ii
from
which
description
one
conjectures
the
author
to
have
derived
his
colours
from
a
state
of
matters
nearer
his
own
day
than
the
period
of
the
judges
the
priests
of
shechem
are
even
taxed
by
the
prophet
with
open
highway
robbery
vi
and
in
one
charge
after
another
he
accuses
them
of
taking
advantage
of
their
office
for
base
gain
of
neglecting
its
most
sacred
duties
and
in
this
way
having
the
principal
blame
for
the
ruin
of
the
people
hear
the
word
of
jehovah
ye
children
of
israel
for
the
lord
hath
a
controversy
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
because
there
is
no
truth
nor
mercy
nor
knowledge
of
god
in
the
land
there
is
swearing
and
iying
and
killing
and
stealing
and
committing
adultery
they
use
violence
and
add
murder
to
murder
therefore
the
land
mourneth
and
every
creature
that
dwelleth
therein
languisheth
even
to
the
wild
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
fowls
of
heaven
and
even
the
fishes
of
the
sea
are
taken
away
yet
let
no
man
strive
and
no
man
reprove
for
the
people
do
just
as
their
priests
therefore
shall
ye
priests
stumble
on
that
day
and
also
the
prophets
with
you
on
that
night
and
i
will
destroy
your
kin
my
people
are
destroyed
for
lack
of
knowledge
because
ye
yourselves
reject
knowledge
i
will
therefore
reject
you
that
ye
shall
be
no
longer
priests
unto
me
ye
have
forgotten
the
doctrine
of
your
god
so
will
i
forget
your
children
the
more
they
are
the
more
they
sin
against
me
their
glory
they
turn
into
shame
they
eat
up
the
sin
of
my
people
and
they
set
their
heart
on
their
iniquity
and
it
shall
be
as
with
the
people
so
with
the
priest
i
will
punish
them
for
their
ways
and
requite
them
for
their
doings
they
shall
eat
and
not
have
enough
they
shall
commit
whoredom
and
shall
not
increase
because
they
have
ceased
to
take
heed
to
the
lord
hosea
iv
in
the
introductory
words
the
people
are
invited
to
hear
what
it
is
that
jehovah
complains
of
them
for
sin
prevails
to
such
an
extent
that
the
complete
ruin
of
the
country
is
inevitable
vers
with
the
word
yet
at
the
beginning
of
the
following
verse
the
prophet
changes
the
course
of
his
thought
from
the
people
he
passes
to
the
priests
the
root
of
the
general
corruption
is
the
want
of
divine
knowledge
the
knowledge
namely
that
i
will
have
mercy
and
not
sacrifice
compare
jeremiah
xxii
and
for
this
the
priests
are
to
blame
whose
task
it
was
to
diffuse
knowledge
but
who
instead
of
this
for
their
own
selfish
interests
fostered
the
tendency
of
the
people
to
seek
jehovah
grace
by
sacrifice
rather
than
by
righteousness
for
if
it
be
conceded
that
it
is
the
priests
who
are
addressed
from
ver
onwards
then
it
is
not
easy
to
see
why
a
change
in
the
address
should
take
place
between
ver
and
ver
especially
as
the
of
priests
with
prophets
seems
more
reasonable
in
ver
than
that
of
prophets
and
people
as
ver
in
this
way
occupies
an
intermediate
position
between
the
complaint
made
against
the
people
in
vers
and
that
against
the
priests
in
vers
the
transition
from
the
one
to
the
other
indicated
by
the
yet
must
occur
in
it
hosea
abruptly
breaks
off
from
reproaching
the
people
yet
let
no
man
strive
and
no
man
reprove
why
not
the
words
that
follow
must
explain
in
verse
some
circumstance
must
be
mentioned
which
excuses
the
people
and
at
the
same
time
draws
down
indignation
upon
the
priests
who
are
the
subjects
of
the
following
these
considerations
necessarily
determine
the
thought
which
we
are
to
expect
namely
this
for
the
people
do
just
as
their
priests
this
meaning
is
obtained
by
the
conjectural
reading
w
my
kkmryw
instead
of
w
mkkmryb
comp
ver
the
remaining
ykh
must
be
deleted
the
ordinary
view
of
ver
is
hardly
worth
refuting
the
l
ywkh
it
is
said
is
spoken
from
the
people
point
of
view
the
people
repel
the
prophet
reproach
and
rebuke
because
such
is
the
interpretation
of
ver
they
themselves
have
no
scruples
in
striving
even
with
the
priest
even
for
want
of
subjection
to
the
priests
is
held
to
be
specially
wicked
but
the
prophet
hosea
would
hardly
have
considered
it
a
capital
offence
if
the
people
had
withheld
from
the
priests
the
respect
of
which
according
to
his
own
language
they
were
so
utterly
unworthy
moreover
every
exegesis
which
finds
in
ver
a
reproach
brought
against
the
people
leaves
in
obscurity
the
point
at
which
the
transition
is
made
from
reproach
of
the
people
to
reproach
of
the
priests
in
the
northern
kingdom
according
to
this
the
spiritual
ascendancy
of
the
priests
over
the
people
seems
hardly
to
have
been
less
than
that
of
the
prophets
and
if
in
the
history
we
hear
less
about
it
the
explanation
is
to
be
sought
in
the
according
to
xvii
the
foreign
colonies
introduced
by
the
assyrians
into
samaria
after
it
had
been
depopulated
were
at
first
devoured
by
lions
because
they
were
ignorant
of
the
right
way
of
honouring
the
deity
of
the
land
esarhaddon
therefore
sent
one
of
the
exiled
samaritan
priests
who
fixed
his
abode
at
bethel
the
ancient
chief
sanctuary
and
instructed
mwrh
the
settlers
in
the
religion
of
the
god
of
the
country
this
presupposes
a
definite
priesthood
which
maintained
itself
even
in
exile
for
a
considerable
time
fact
that
they
laboured
quietly
and
regularly
in
limited
circles
taking
no
part
in
politics
and
fully
submissive
to
the
established
order
and
that
for
this
reason
they
attracted
less
notice
and
were
less
talked
about
than
the
prophets
who
like
elijah
and
elisha
stirred
up
israel
by
their
extraordinary
and
oppositional
action
in
judah
the
nucleus
of
the
development
was
the
same
as
in
israel
the
idea
that
in
judah
the
genuine
mosaic
priesthood
had
by
the
grace
of
god
been
maintained
while
in
israel
on
the
other
hand
a
schismatic
priesthood
had
intruded
itself
by
the
favour
of
the
king
and
man
device
is
that
of
the
later
judaeans
who
had
the
last
word
and
were
therefore
of
course
in
the
right
the
zadok
of
jerusalem
as
contrasted
with
the
eli
whom
they
superseded
were
originally
illegitimate
if
one
may
venture
to
apply
a
conception
which
at
that
time
was
quite
unknown
and
did
not
inherit
their
right
from
the
fathers
but
had
it
from
david
and
solomon
they
always
remained
in
this
dependent
condition
they
at
all
times
walked
as
ii
has
it
before
jehovah
anointed
as
his
servants
and
officers
to
the
kings
the
temple
was
a
part
of
their
palace
which
as
is
shown
by
vii
and
stood
upon
the
same
hill
and
was
contiguous
with
it
they
placed
their
threshold
alongside
of
that
of
jehovah
and
made
their
adjoin
to
his
so
that
only
the
wall
intervened
between
jehovah
and
them
ezekiel
xliii
they
shaped
the
official
cultus
entirely
as
they
chose
and
regarded
the
management
of
it
at
least
so
far
as
one
gathers
from
the
epitome
of
the
book
of
the
kings
as
the
main
business
of
their
government
they
introduced
new
usages
and
abolished
old
ones
and
as
they
did
so
the
priests
always
bent
to
their
will
and
were
merely
their
executive
organs
that
they
were
at
compare
for
example
xii
seq
joash
and
jehoiada
xvi
seq
ahaz
and
urijah
and
finally
chap
xxii
josiah
and
hilkiah
liberty
to
offer
sacrifice
also
is
a
thing
of
course
they
did
it
however
only
on
exceptional
occasions
such
as
perhaps
at
the
dedication
of
a
new
altar
xvi
even
with
jeremiah
who
as
a
rule
does
not
consider
sacrifice
and
drawing
near
to
jehovah
numbers
xvi
as
every
man
business
the
king
as
such
is
held
to
be
also
the
supreme
priest
for
at
the
beginning
of
the
exile
and
the
foreign
domination
his
hope
for
the
future
is
their
potentate
shall
be
of
themselves
and
their
governor
shall
proceed
from
the
midst
of
them
and
i
will
cause
him
to
draw
near
and
he
shall
approach
unto
me
for
who
else
should
have
the
courage
to
approach
unto
me
saith
the
lord
xxx
ezekiel
is
the
first
to
protest
against
dealing
with
the
temple
as
a
royal
dependency
for
him
the
prerogative
of
the
prince
is
reduced
to
this
that
it
is
his
duty
to
support
the
public
cultus
at
his
own
expense
the
distinction
between
the
judaean
and
the
israelite
priesthood
did
not
exist
at
first
but
arose
out
of
the
course
of
events
the
sheltered
and
quiet
life
of
the
little
state
in
the
south
presents
a
marked
contrast
with
the
external
and
internal
conflicts
the
easily
raised
turmoil
of
the
northern
kingdom
in
the
latter
the
continual
agitation
brought
extraordinary
personalities
up
to
the
surface
in
the
former
institutions
based
upon
the
permanent
order
of
things
and
supported
by
permanent
powers
were
the
rechabites
who
arose
in
the
northern
kingdom
continued
to
subsist
in
judah
and
jeremiah
prophesied
to
them
that
there
should
never
fail
them
a
priestly
head
of
the
family
of
their
founder
xxxv
naturally
the
monarchy
itself
benefited
most
by
this
stability
the
king
cultus
which
in
the
kingdom
of
samaria
was
in
no
position
to
supersede
the
popular
and
independent
worship
easily
obtained
a
perceptible
preponderance
in
the
smaller
judah
the
king
priesthood
which
in
the
former
was
incidentally
involved
in
disaster
by
the
overthrow
of
the
dynasty
in
the
latter
gained
in
strength
side
by
side
with
the
house
of
david
even
aaron
and
amminadab
were
according
to
the
priestly
code
related
to
the
royal
family
as
jehoiada
and
ahaziah
were
in
actual
fact
thus
at
an
early
period
was
the
way
paved
for
the
act
of
uniformity
by
which
josiah
made
the
king
cultus
the
official
and
the
only
one
one
effect
which
accompanied
the
measures
he
took
was
naturally
the
exclusive
legitimation
of
the
king
priesthood
at
jerusalem
but
the
principle
of
heredity
had
already
pervaded
the
other
priestly
families
so
thoroughly
that
to
enter
any
secular
calling
was
nowhere
expected
of
them
the
deuteronomic
legislator
had
conferred
upon
them
the
right
of
carrying
on
their
office
at
jerusalem
and
of
executing
it
there
on
behalf
of
any
one
who
requested
their
services
but
this
regulation
from
the
opposition
of
the
zadok
was
found
on
the
whole
impracticable
xxiii
although
doubtless
some
extraneous
elements
may
at
that
time
have
succeeded
in
making
their
way
into
the
temple
nobility
the
bulk
of
the
priests
of
the
high
places
who
had
been
superseded
had
to
content
themselves
since
they
could
not
now
get
rid
of
their
spiritual
character
with
being
degraded
among
their
brethren
at
jerusalem
and
with
admission
to
a
subordinate
share
in
the
service
of
the
sanctuary
comp
ii
it
was
thus
at
the
close
of
the
history
that
the
distinction
between
priests
and
levites
arose
to
which
ezekiel
is
at
pains
to
give
the
sanction
of
law
on
the
whole
it
is
easy
here
to
bring
the
successive
strata
of
the
pentateuch
into
with
the
recognisable
steps
of
the
historical
development
in
the
jehovistic
legislation
there
is
no
word
of
priests
exodus
xxxiv
and
even
such
precepts
as
thou
shalt
not
go
up
by

that
thy
nakedness
be
not
discovered
thereon

are
directed
to
the
general
thou
that
is
to
the
people
with
this
corresponds
the
fact
that
in
the
solemn
ratification
of
the
covenant
of
sinai
exodus
xxiv
it
is
young
men
of
the
children
of

who
officiate
as
sacrificers

figure
as
the
founders
of
the
clerical
order
twice
in
exodus
xix
and
xxxii
mention
is
made
of
other
priests
besides
but
exodus
xxxii
rests
upon
deuteronomy
and
even
exodus
xix
can
hardly
have
been
an
original
constituent
of
one
of
the
jehovistic
sources
in
deuteronomy
the
priests
as
compared
with
the
judges
and
the
prophets
take
a
very
prominent
position
xvi
and
constitute
a
clerical
order
hereditary
in
numerous
families
whose
privilege
is
uncontested
and
therefore
also
does
not
require
protection
here
now
for
the
first
time
begins
the
regular
use
of
the
name
of
levites
for
the
priests
a
name
of
which
the
consideration
has
been
postponed
until
now
in
the
literature
apart
from
the
pentateuch
it
occurs
very
seldom
first
in
the
prophets
once
in
the
book
of
jeremiah
xxxiii
in
a
passage
which
in
any
case
is
later
than
the
capture
of
jerusalem
by
the
chaldaeans
and
certainly
was
not
written
by
jeremiah
the
use
of
the
name
is
an
in
the
lxx
chap
xxxiii
is
wanting
the
parallelism
between
vers
and
is
striking
it
looks
as
if
david
and
levi
arose
out
of
a
misunderstanding
of
the
families
mentioned
in
ver
namely
judah
and
ephraim
in
any
case
wdwd
in
ver
is
an
interpolation
established
thing
in
ezekiel
and
henceforward
occurs
without
interruption
in
the
writings
of
the
later
prophets
a
sign
that
its
earlier
absence
is
not
to
be
explained
as
accidental
not
even
in
jeremiah

speaks
so
frequently

however
the

in

case
it
is
not
the
levites
who
are
spoken
of
as
elsewhere
but
a
levite
who
passes
for
a
great
rarity
and
who
is
forcibly
carried
off
by
the
tribe
of
dan
which
has
none

this
jonathan

ancestor
of

that

as

xviii
the
other
ancient
priestly
family
that
goes
back
to
the
period
of
the
judges
the
ephraimitic
of
shiloh
appears
also
to
be
brought
into
connection
with
moses
at
least
in
ii
a
passage
however
which
is
certainly
where
jehovah
is
spoken
of
as
having
made
himself
known
to
the
ancestors
of
eli
in
egypt
and
as
thereby
having
laid
the
foundation
for
the
bestowal
of
the
priesthood
it
is
clearly
moses
who
is
thought
of
as
the
recipient
of
the
revelation
historical
probability
admits
of
the
family
being
traced
back
to
phinehas
who
during
the
early
period
of
the
judges
was
priest
of
the
ark
and
from
whom
the
inheritance
on
mount
ephraim
and
also
the
second
son
of
eli
were
named
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
is
the
mere
shadow
of
his
younger
namesake
as
the
latter
predeceased
his
father
and
was
of
quite
secondary
importance
beside
him
but
phinehas
is
both
in
the
priestly
code
and
in
josh
xxiv
e
the
son
of
eleazar
and
eleazar
is
according
to
normal
tradition
indeed
a
son
of
aaron
but
according
to
the
sound
of
his
name
eliezer
a
son
of
moses
along
with
gershom
between
aaron
and
moses
in
the
jehovistic
portion
of
the
pentateuch
no
great
distinction
is
made
if
aaron
in
contradistinction
from
his
brother
is
characterised
as
the
levite
exodus
iv
moses
on
the
other
hand
bears
the
priestly
staff
is
over
the
sanctuary
and
has
joshua
to
assist
him
as
eli
had
samuel
exodus
xxxiii
plainly
the
older
claims
are
his
in
the
main
jehovistic
source
in
j
aaron
originally
does
not
occur
at
all
neither
that

in

times
always
when

in
distress
summons
moses
and
aaron
in
order
to
ask
their
intercession
but
strangely
enough
aaron
is
afterwards
completely
ignored
again
moses
alone
makes
answer
speaking
solely
in
his
own
name
and
not
in
aaron

and
although
he
has
not

prayer

singular

the
change
of
the
number
in

is
under
these
circumstances
suspicious
enough
it
appears
as
if
the
jehovistic
editor
had
held
aaron
presence
to
be
appropriate
precisely
at
the
intercession
is
he
mentioned
in
deuteronomy
xxxiii
in
the
genealogies
of
the
priestly
code
one
main
branch
of
the
tribe
of
levi
is
still
called
like
the
eldest
son
of
moses
gershom
and
another
important
member
is
actually
called
mushi
the
mosaite
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
holy
office
may
have
continued
in
the
family
of
moses
and
it
is
very
likely
that
the
two
oldest
houses
in
which
it
was
hereditary
those
at
dan
and
at
shiloh
may
have
claimed
in
all
seriousness
to
have
been
descended
from
him
afterwards
as
deuteronomy
xxxiii
seq
informs
us
all
priests
honoured
moses
as
their
father
not
as
being
the
head
of
their
clan
but
as
being
the
founder
of
their
order
the
same
took
place
in
judah
but
there
the
clerical
guild
ultimately
acquired
a
hereditary
character
and
the
order
became
a
sort
of
clan
previously
an
official
name
now
became
a
patronymic
at
the
same
time
and
all
the
levites
together
formed
a
the
instance
of
the
rechabites
shows
how
easily
the
transition
could
made
a
race
which
had
not
received
any
land
of
its
own
indeed
but
in
compensation
had
obtained
the
priesthood
for
its
heritage
this
hereditary
clergy
was
alleged
to
have
existed
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
history
of
israel
and
even
then
as
a
numerous
body
consisting
of
many
others
besides
moses
and
aaron
such
is
the
representation
made
by
deuteronomist
and
subsequent
writers
but
in
deuteronomy
we
read
chiefly
of
the
in
the
provincial
towns
of
judah
and
of
the
the
in
jerusalem
seldom
of
levi
as
a
whole
x

on
deut

compare
kuenen
theol
that
the
hereditary
character
of
the
priesthood
is
here
antedated
and
really
first
arose
in
the
later
period
of
the
kings
has
already
been
shown
in
the
particular
instance
of
the
sons
of
zadok
of
jerusalem
who
were
at
first
parvenus
and
afterwards
became
the
most
legitimate
of
the
legitimate
but
it
is
very
remarkable
how
this
artificial
construction
of
a
priestly
family
a
construction
which
has
absolutely
nothing
perplexing
in
itself
was
suggested
and
favoured
by
the
circumstance
that
in
remote
antiquity
there
once
actually
did
exist
a
veritable
tribe
of
levi
which
had
already
disappeared
before
the
period
of
the
rise
of
the
monarchy
this
tribe
belonged
to
the
group
of
the
four
oldest
sons
of
leah
reuben
simeon
levi
judah
who
are
always
enumerated
together
in
this
order
and
who
settled
on
both
sides
of
the
dead
sea
towards
the
wilderness
singularly
no
one
of
them
succeeded
in
holding
its
own
except
judah
all
the
others
became
absorbed
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
wilderness
or
in
other
branches
of
their
kindred
the
earliest
to
find
this
destiny
were
the
two
tribes
of
simeon
and
levi
in
genesis
xlix
regarded
as
one
in
consequence
of
a
catastrophe
which
must
have
befallen
them
at
some
time
during
the
period
of
the
judges
simeon
and
levi
are
brethren
their
shepherds
staves
are
weapons
of
slaughter
o
my
soul
come
not
thou
into
their
assembly
mine
honour
be
thou
far
from
their
band
for
they
slew
men
in
their
anger
and
in
their
they
houghed
oxen
cursed
be
their
anger
so
fierce
and
their
wrath
so
cruel
i
will
divide
them
in
jacob
and
scatter
them
over
israel
genesis
the
offence
of
simeon
and
levi
here
rebuked
can
not
have
been
committed
against
israelites
for
in
such
a
case
the
thought
could
not
have
occurred
which
is
here
emphatically
repelled
that
jacob
that
is
to
say
israel
as
a
whole
could
have
made
common
cause
with
them
what
is
here
spoken
of
must
be
some
crime
against
the
canaanites
very
probably
the
identical
crime
which
is
charged
upon
the
two
brothers
in
genesis
and
which
there
also
jacob
ver
repudiates
the
treacherous
attack
upon
shechem
and
massacre
of
its
inhabitants
in
disregard
of
the
treaty
which
had
been
made
in
judges
ix
it
is
related
that
shechem
until
then
a
flourishing
town
of
the
canaanites
with
whom
moreover
israelite
elements
were
already
beginning
to
blend
was
conquered
and
destroyed
by
abimelech
but
it
is
quite
impossible
to
bring
into
any
connection
with
this
the
violent
deed
of
simeon
and
levi
which
must
have
taken
place
earlier
although
also
within
the
period
of
the
judges
the
consequences
of
their
act
the
vengeance
of
the
canaanites
the
two
tribes
had
to
bear
alone
israel
according
to
the
indication
given
in
genesis
xlix
xxxiv
did
not
feel
any
call
to
interfere
on
their
behalf
or
make
common
cause
with
them
thus
they
fell
to
pieces
and
passed
out
of
sight
in
the
opinion
of
their
own
nation
a
just
fate
in
the
historical
books
they
are
never
again
mentioned
it
is
quite
impossible
to
regard
this
levi
of
the
book
of
genesis
as
a
mere
shadow
of
the
caste
which
towards
the
end
of
the
monarchy
arose
out
of
the
separate
priestly
families
of
judah
the
utterance
given
in
genesis
xlix
puts
the
brothers
on
an
exact
equality
and
assigns
to
them
an
extremely
secular
and
character
there
is
not
the
faintest
idea
of
levi
sacred
calling
or
of
his
dispersion
as
being
conditioned
thereby
the
dispersion
is
a
curse
and
no
blessing
an
annihilation
and
no
establishment
of
his
special
character
but
it
is
equally
an
impossibility
to
derive
the
caste
from
the
tribe
there
is
no
real
connection
between
the
two
all
the
intermediate
links
are
wanting
the
tribe
succumbed
at
an
early
date
and
the
rise
of
the
caste
was
very
late
and
demonstrably
from
unconnected
beginnings
but
in
these
circumstances
the
coincidence
of
name
is
also
very
puzzling
levi
the
third
son
of
jacob
perhaps
a
mere
patronymic
derived
form
his
mother
leah
and
levi
the
official
priest
if
it
were
practicable
to
find
a
convincing
derivation
of
levi
in
its
later
use
from
the
appellative
meaning
of
the
root
then
one
might
believe
the
coincidence
to
be
merley
fortuitous
but
it
is
impossible
to
do
so
the
solution
therefore
has
been
suggested
that
the
violent
dissolution
of
the
tribe
in
the
period
of
the
judges
led
the
individual
levites
who
now
were
landless
to
seek
their
maintenance
by
the
exercise
of
sacrificial
functions
this
lay
to
their
hand
and
was
successful
because
moses
them
an
of
god
had
belonged
to
their
number
and
had
transmitted
to
them
by
hereditary
succession
a
certain
preferential
claim
to
the
sacred
office
but
at
that
time
priestly
posts
were
not
numerous
and
such
an
entrance
of
the
levites
into
the
service
of
jehovah
in
that
early
time
is
in
view
of
the
infrequency
of
the
larger
sanctuaries
a
very
difficult
assumption
it
is
perhaps
correct
to
say
that
moses
actually
was
descended
from
levi
and
that
the
later
significance
of
the
name
levite
is
to
be
explained
by
reference
to
him
in
point
of
fact
the
name
does
appear
to
have
been
given
in
the
first
instance
only
to
the
descendants
of
moses
and
not
to
have
been
transferred
until
a
later
period
to
those
priests
as
a
body
who
were
quite
unconnected
with
him
by
blood
but
who
all
desired
to
stand
related
to
him
as
their
head
here
it
will
never
be
possible
to
get
beyond
conjecture

clerical
of

with

from

nevertheless
it
is

to
distinguish
him
by
the
style
thy
brother

in

we
are
struck
by
the
deliberate
emphasis
laid
on
the
equal
right
of
all
the
levites
to
sacrificial
service
in
jerusalem
the
priests
the
levites
the
whole
tribe
of
levi
shall
have
no
portion
or
inheritance
with
israel
they
shall
eat
the
offerings
of
jehovah
and
his
inheritance
if
a
levite
come
from
any
of
thy
cities
out
of
all
israel
where
he
sojourned
and
come
to
the
place
which
jehovah
shall
choose
then
he
shall
minister
in
the
name
of
jehovah
his
god
as
all
his
brethren
the
levites
do
who
stand
there
before

deuteronomy
xviii
here
the
legislator
has
in
view
his
main
enactment
the
abolition
of
all
places
of
worship
except
the
temple
of
solomon
those
who
had
hitherto
been
the
priests
of
these
could
not
be
allowed
to
starve
therefore
it
is
that
he
impresses
it
so
often
and
so
earnestly
on
the
people
of
the
provinces
that
in
their
sacrificial
pilgrimages
to
jerusalem
they
ought
not
to
forget
the
levite
of
their
native
place
but
should
carry
him
with
them
for
an
understanding
of
the
subsequent
development
this
is
very
important
in
so
far
as
it
shows
how
the
position
of
the
levites
outside
of
jerusalem
was
threatened
by
the
centralisation
of
the
worship
in
point
of
fact
the
good
intention
of
the
deuteronomist
proved
impossible
of
realisation
with
the
high
places
fell
also
the
priests
of
the
high
places
in
so
far
as
they
continued
to
have
any
part
at
all
in
the
sacred
service
they
had
to
accept
a
position
of
subordination
under
the
sons
of
zadok
xxiii
perhaps
graf
was
correct
in
referring
to
this
the
prophecy
of
ii
according
to
which
the
descendants
of
the
fallen
house
of
eli
are
to
come
to
the
firmly
established
regius
priest
to
beg
for
an
alms
or
to
say
put
me
i
pray
thee
into
one
of
the
priests
offices
that
i
may
eat
a
piece
of
bread
that
historically
the
deposed
levites
had
no
very
intimate
connection
with
those
ancient
companions
in
misfortune
is
no
serious
objection
to
such
an
interpretation
in
the
case
of
a
writer
in
this
way
arose
as
an
illegal
consequence
of
reformation
the
distinction
between
priests
and
levites
with
ezekiel
this
distinction
is
still
an
innovation
requiring
justification
and
sanction
with
the
priestly
code
it
is
a
statute
for
ever
although
even
yet
not
absolutely
undisputed
as
appears
from
the
priestly
version
of
the
story
of

how
can
we
explain
this
preponderance
of
priests
over
levites
which
is
still
surprising
even
if
the
individual
figures
are
not
to
be
taken
as
exact
certainly
it
can
not
be
accounted
for
if
the
state
of
matters
for
a
thousand
years
had
been
that
represented
in
the
priestly
code
and
in
chronicles
on
the
other
hand
all
perplexity
vanishes
if
the
levites
were
the
degraded
priests
of
the
high
places
of
judah
these
were
certainly
not
on
the
whole
more
numerous
than
the
jerusalem
college
and
the
prospect
of
thenceforward
not
being
permitted
to
sacrifice
in
their
native
land
but
of
having
slaughtering
and
washing
for
sole
duties
can
not
have
been
in
any
way
very
attractive
to
them
one
can
hardly
blame
them
if
they
were
disinclined
voluntarily
to
lower
themselves
to
the
position
of
mere
laborers
under
the
sons
of
zadok
besides
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
many
and
more
particularly
levitical
elements
not
originally
belonging
to
it
had
managed
to
make
way
into
the
ranks
of
the
solomonic
priesthood
that
all
were
not
successful
ezra
ii
shows
that
many
made
the
attempt
and
considering
the
ease
with
which
genealogies
hoary
with
age
were
then
manufactured
and
accepted
every
such
attempt
can
not
have
failed
how
then
came
it
to
pass
that
afterwards
as
one
must
conclude
from
the
statements
in
chronicles
the
levites
stood
to
the
priests
in
a
proportion
so
much
more
nearly
if
even
then
not
quite
fully
corresponding
to
the
law
simply
by
the
levitising
of
alien
families
at
first
in
the
community
of
the
second

the
levites
continued
to
be
distinguished
from
the

where

not

is
true
the

at

had
become
so
magnificent

its

so
numerous
as
to
render
necessary
an
orderly
division

and
a
gradation
of

in
jeremiah
time
the
priests
constituted
a
guild
divided
into

as
we
have
seen
the
sanctuary
was
the
property
of
the
king
and
the
priest
was
his
servant
even
in
ezekiel
who
on
the
whole
is
labouring
towards
emancipation
the
prince
has
nevertheless
a
very
great
importance
in
the

still
to
him
the
dues
of
the
people
are
paid
and
the
sacrificial
expenses
are
in

defrayed
by
him
in
the

on
the
other
hand
the
dues
are
paid
direct
into
the
sanctuary
the
worship
is
perfectly
autonomous
and
has
its
own
head
holding
not
from
man

from
the
grace
of
god
nor
is
it
merely
the
autonomy
of
religion
that
is

exhibits
also
its
supremacy
over

he
does
not

sceptre

nowhere
as
vatke
well
remarks
is
any
attempt
made

claim
for
him
secular
power

just
in

his

at

what
but
that
civil
power
has
been
withdrawn
from
the
nation
and
is
in
the
hands
of
foreigners
that
israel
has
now
merely
a
spiritual
and
ecclesiastical
existence
in
the
eyes
of
the
priestly
code
israel
in
point
of
fact
is
not
a
people
but
a
church
worldly
affairs
are
far
removed
from
it
and
are
never
touched
by
its
laws
its
life
is
spent
in
religious
services
here
we
are
face
to
face
with
the
church
of
the
second
temple
the
jewish
hierocracy
in
a
form
possible
only
under
foreign
domination
it
is
customary
indeed
to
designate
in
the
law
by
the
ideal
or
in
other
words
blind
name
of
theocracy
that
which
in
historical
reality
is
usually
called
hierarchy
but
to
imagine
that
with
the
two
names
one
has
gained
a
real
distinction
is
merely
to
deceive
oneself
but
this
accomplished
it
is
easy
further
to
carry
back
the
hierocratic
churchly
constitution
to
the
time
of
moses
because
it
excludes
the
kingship
and
then
either
to
assert
that
it
was
kept
secret
throughout
the
entire
period
of
the
judges
and
the
monarchy
or
to
use
the
fiction
as
a
lever
by
which
to
dislocate
the
whole
of
the
traditional
history
to
any
one
who
knows
anything
about
history
it
is
not
necessary
to
prove
that
the
mosaic
theocracy
which
nowhere
suits
the
circumstances
of
the
earlier
periods
and
of
which
the
prophets
even
in
their
most
ideal
delineations
of
the
israelite
state
as
it
ought
to
be
have
not
the
faintest
shadow
of
an
idea
is
so
to
speak
a
perfect
fit
for
judaism
and
had
its
actuality
only
there
foreign
rulers
had
then
relieved
the
jews
of
all
concern
about
secular
affairs
they
had
it
in
their
power
and
were
indeed
compelled
to
give
themselves
wholly
up
to
sacred
things
in
which
they
were
left
completely
unhampered
thus
the
temple
became
the
sole
centre
of
life
and
the
prince
of
the
temple
the
head
of
the
spiritual
commonwealth
to
which
also
the
control
of
political
affairs
so
far
as
these
were
still
left
to
the
nation
naturally
fell
there
being
no
other
head
very
interesting
and
instructive
is
ewald
proof
of
the
way
in
which
zech

has
been
tampered
with
so
as
to
eliminate
zerubbabel
and
leave
the
high
priest
alone
just
so
in
dealing
with
caliphs
and
sultans
the
patriarchs
were
and
are
the
natural
heads
of
the
greek
and
oriental
christians
even
in
secular
matters
the
chronicler
gave
a
corresponding
number
of
high
priests
to
the
twice
twelve
generations
of
forty
years
each
which
were
usually
assumed
to
have
elapsed
between
the

and
the
building

and
again
between
that
and
the
close
of
the

the
official
terms
of

knows
nothing

taken

majesty

had

in
some
sense

compensation
for
the
earthly
dignity
which
had
been
lost
under
the
rule
of
the
greeks
the
high
priest
became
ethnarch
and
president
of
the

only
through
the
pontificate
was
it
possible
for
the
hasmonaeans
to
attain
to
power
but
when
they
conjoined
it
with
secular
sovereignty
they
created
a
dilemma
to
the
consequences

they
succumbed

loss
of
point
sustained
by
the
phrase
to
fill
the
hand
at
all
times
used
to
denote
ordination
originally
it
can
not
have
had
any
other
meaning
than
that
of
filling
the
hand
with
money
or
its
equivalent
we
have
seen
that
at
one
time
the
priest
was
appointed
by
the
owner
of
a
sanctuary
for
a
salary
and
that
without
being
thus
dependent
upon
a
particular
employer
he
could
not
then
live
on
the
income
derived
from
those
who
might
employ
him
sacrificially
but
when
the
levitical
hereditary
priesthood
arose
in
the
later
kingdom
of
judah
the
hands
of
the
priests
were
no
longer
filled
by
another
who
had
the
right
to
appoint
and
to
dismiss
but
they
themselves
at
god
command
filled
their
own
hand
or
rather
they
had
done
so
in
the
days
of
moses
once
for
all
as
is
said
in
exodus
xxxii
an
insertion
corresponding
with
the
position
of
deuteronomy
it
is
obvious
that
such
a
statement
when
carefully
looked
at
is
absurd
but
is
to
be
explained
by
the
desire
to
protest
against
outside
interference
even
here
the
etymological
sense
is
still
sufficiently
felt
to
create
an
involuntary
jar
and
leads
to
a
change
of
the
construction
but
finally
all
sense
of
it
is
lost
and
the
expression
becomes
quite
colourless
to
fill
the
hand
means
simply
to
consecrate
in
ezekiel
not
only
the
priest
but
also
the
altar
has
its
hand
filled
xliii
in
the
priestly
code
the
abstract
consecrations
is
chiefly
used
with
subject
and
object
left
out
as
the
name
of
a
mere
inaugural
ceremony
which
lasts
for
several
days

exodus

essentially
consists
in
the
bringing
of
an
offering
on
the
part
of

to
be
consecrated
and
has
no
longer
even
the
remotest
connection
with
actual
filling
of
the
hand
xiii
comp
xxix
the
verb
therefore
now
means
simply
the
performance
of
this
ceremony
and
the

this
variation
in
the
is
the
echo
of
real
changes
in
the
outuard
condition
of
the
clergy
which
we
must
now
proceed
to
consider
more
in
detail
of
the
offerings
it
was
the
custom
in
the
earlier
time
to
dedicate
a
portion
to
the
deity
but
to
use
the
greater
part
in
sacred
feasts
at
which
a
priest
if
present
was
of
course
allowed
also
in
one
way
or
another
to
participate
but
he
does
not
appear
to
have
had
a
legal
claim
to
any
definite
dues
of
flesh
eli
sons
were
worthless
persons
and
cared
not
about
jehovah
or
about
the
priests
right
and
duty
with
the
people
when
any
man
offered
a
sacrifice
the
servant
of
the
priest
came
that
is
all
we
have
here
to
represent
the
levites
while
the
flesh
was
in
seething
with
a
in
his
hand
and
stuck
it
into
the
pan
or
kettle
or
caldron
or
pot
and
all
that
the
brought
up
the
priest
took
so
they
did
in
shiloh
unto
all
the
israelites
that
came
thither
even
before
the
fat
was
burnt
the
servant
of
the
priest
came
and
said
to
the
man
that
sacrificed
give
flesh
to
roast
for
the
priest
he
will
not
take
sodden
flesh
of
thee
but
raw
and
if
the
other
said
to
him
let
the
fat
first
be
burnt
and
then
take
according
to
thy
soul
desire
then
he
would
answer
nay
but
thou
shalt
give
it
now
and
if
not
i
will
take
it
by
force
ii
the
tribute
of
raw
portions
of
flesh
before
the
burning
of
the
fat
is
here
treated
as
a
shameless
demand
which
is
fitted
to
bring
jehovah
offering
into
contempt
ver
and
which
has
the
ruin
of
the
sons
of
eli
as
its
merited
reward
more
tolerable
is
it
though
even
that
is
an
abuse
when
the
priests
cause
boiled
flesh
to
be
brought
them
from
the
pot
though
not
seeking
out
the
best
for
themselves
but
leaving
the
selection
to
chance
they
ought
to
wait
and
see
what
is
given
to
them
or
be
contented
with
an
invitation
to
the
banquet
on
the
other
hand
we
have
it
in
deuteronomy
as
the
priest
due
from
the
people
xviii
ii
that
he
receives
the
shoulder
and
the
two
cheeks
and
the
maw
of
the
slaughtered
animal
and
yet
this
is
a
modest
claim
compared
with
what
the
sons
of
aaron
have
in
the
priestly
code
leviticus
vii
the
right
leg
and
the
breast
the
course
of
the
development
is
plain
the
priestly
code
became
law
for
judaism
in
sacrifice
its
demands
were
those
which
were
regarded
but
in
order
to
fulfil
all
righteousness
the
precept
of
deuteronomy
was
also
maintained
this
being
applied
against
the
obvious
meaning
and
certainly
only
as
a
result
of
later
scrupulosity
of
the
scribes
not
to
sacrifices
but
to
ordinary
secular
slaughterings
from
which
also
accordingly
the
priests
received
a
portion
the
cheeks
according
to
jerome
on
malachi
ii
including
the
tongue
the
precept
being
thus
harmonistically
doubled
at
an
earlier
philo
de
praem
sec
josephus
iii
iv
date
the
priests
at
jerusalem
received
money
from
those
who
employed
them
deuteronomy
xviii
but
for
this
had
the
obligation
of
maintaining
the
temple
from
this
one
can
discern
that
the
money
was
properly
speaking
paid
to
the
sanctuary
and
was
only
conditionally
delivered
to
its
servitors
when
they
failed
to
observe
the
condition
king
jehoash
took
the
money
also
from
them
xii
the
are
in
the
priestly
code
a
subordinate
matter
and
the
share
that
falls
to
the
priests
is
here
trifling
compared
with
what
they
receive
of
the
other
sacrifices
the
meal
of
which
only
a
handful
is
sprinkled
upon
the
altar
the
baked
bread
and
the
minha
altogether
are
theirs
entirely
so
also
the
sin
and
trespass
offerings
so
frequently
demanded
of
which
god
receives
only
the
blood
and
the
fat
and
the
offerer
nothing
at
all
ezekiel
xliv
of
the
at
least
the
skin
falls
to
their
lot
these
perquisites
however
none
of
them
in
their
definite
form
demonstrably
old
and
some
of
them
demonstrably
the
reverse
may
be
presumed
to
have
had
their
analogues
in
the
earlier
period
so
that
they
can
not
be
regarded
absolutely
as
augmentation
of
the
priestly
income
in
time
the
mac
c
oth
were
among
the
principal
means
of
support
of
the
priests
xxiii
doubtless
they
came
for
the
most
part
from
the
minha
instead
of
sin
and
trespass
offerings
which
are
still
unknown
to
deuteronomy
there
were
formerly
sin
and
trespass
dues
in
the
form
of
money
payments
to
the
priests
payments
which
can
not
however
have
been
so
regular
xii
it
is
as
if
money
payments
were
in
the
eye
of
the
law
too
profane
for
atonement
there
must
be
shedding
of
blood
that
the
skin
of
the
holocaust
which
can
not
well
be
consumed
on
the
altar
should
fall
to
the
priest
is
so
natural
an
arrangement
that
one
will
hardly
be
disposed
to
regard
it
as
new
although
ezekiel
is
silent
about
a
due
which
was
not
quite
worthless
xliv
so
far
then
as
departures
from
earlier
custom
can
be
shown
in
the
sacrificial
dues
enjoined
by
the
priestly
code
they
must
not
indeed
be
treated
as
purely
local
differences
but
neither
are
they
to
be
regarded
as
on
the
whole
showing
a
serious
raising
of
the
tariff
but
in
the
code
the
sacrificial
dues
are
only
a
subordinate
part
of
the
income
of
the
priests
in
deuteronomy
the
priests
are
entirely
thrown
upon
the
sacrifices
they
live
upon
them
xviii
and
upon
invitations
to
the
sacred
banquets
xii
seq
if
they
are
not
exercising
the
priestly
function
they
must
starve
ii
on
the
other
hand
the
aaronidae
of
the
priestly
code
do
not
need
to
sacrifice
at
all
and
yet
have
means
of
support
for
their
chief
revenue
consists
of
the
rich
dues
which
must
be
paid
them
from
the
products
of
the
soil
the
dues
falling
to
the
priests
according
to
the
law
were
all
originally
offerings
the
regular
offerings
which
had
to
be
brought
on
the
festivals
and
these
all
originally
were
for
sacred
banquets
of
which
the
priests
received
nothing
more
than
the
share
which
was
generally
customary
this
is
true
in
the
first
instance
of
the
male
firstlings
of
cattle
as
we
have
seen
in
the
chapter
on
the
sacred
feasts
these
are
sacrifices
and
sacrificial
meals
alike
in
the
jehovistic
legislation
and
in
the
jehovistic
narrative
of
the
exodus
and
of
abel
as
were
all
the
offerings
brought
by
private
individuals
in
the
olden
time
when
in
exodus
xxii
it
is
said
that
they
must
be
given
to
jehovah
this
does
not
mean
that
they
must
be
given
to
the
priests
no
such
thing
is
anywhere
said
in
thc
book
of
the
covenant
matters
still
stand
on
essentially
the
same
footing
in
deuteronomy
also
thou
shalt
sanctify
them
unto
jehovah
thou
shalt
not
plough
with
the
firstling
of
the
bullock
nor
shear
the
firstling
of
thy
sheep
thou
shalt
eat
it
before
jehovah
year
by
year
in
the
place
which
he
shall
choose
and
if
there
be
any
blemish
therein
thou
shalt
not
offer
it
to
jehovah
thy
god
deuteronomy
xv
to
sanctify
to
jehovah
to
eat
before
jehovah
to
offer
to
jehovah
are
here
three
equivalent
ideas
if
now
in
numbers
xviii
every
first
birth
is
assigned
without
circumlocution
to
the
priest
and
a
special
paschal
offering
is
appointed
in
addition
this
can
only
be
understood
as
the
last
phase
in
the
development
partly
because
the
idea
of
dues
altogether
is
secondary
to
that
of
offerings
and
partly
because
the
immense
augmentation
in
the
income
of
the
priests
points
to
an
increase
of
the
hierocratic
power
ezekiel
does
not
yet
reckon
the
firstlings
among
the
revenues
of
the
clergy
xliv
the
praxis
of
judaism
on
the
other
hand
since
nehemiah
x
is
regulated
as
usual
in
accordance
with
the
norm
of
the
priestly
code
the
tithe
also
is
originally
given
to
god
and
treated
just
as
the
other
offerings
are
that
is
to
say
it
is
not
appropriated
by
the
priests
but
eaten
by
those
who
bring
it
in
sacred
banquets
it
does
not
occur
in
the
jehovistic
legislation
but
jacob
dedicates
it
genesis
xxviii
to
the
god
of
bethel
a
place
where
although
the
whole
story
is
a
projection
out
of
a
later
time
it
would
hardly
be
in
harmony
with
the
conceptions
of
the
narrator
to
think
of
the
presence
of
priests
the
prophet
amos
who
probably
represents
much
the
same
stage
of
the
cultus
as
the
jehovist
does
says
come
to
bethel
to
transgress
to
gilgal
to
sin
still
more
and
bring
every
morning
your
sacrifices
every
three
days
your
tithes
and
offer
with
bread
pieces
of
flesh
to
the
flames
and
proclaim
free
offerings
aloud
for
so
ye
like
ye
children
of
israel
amos
iv
he
ironically
recommends
them
to
persevere
in
the
efforts
they
have
hitherto
made
in
honour
of
god
and
to
double
them
to
offer
daily
instead
of
as
was
usual
i
yearly
at
the
chief
festival
to
pay
tithes
every
three
days
instead
of
as
was
the
custom
every
three
years
it
is
clear
that
the
tithe
here
holds
rank
with
zebah
toda
and
nedaba
it
is
a
sacrifice
of
joy
and
a
splendid
element
of
the
public
cultus
no
mere
due
to
the
priests
now
in
this
point
also
deuteronomy
has
left
the
old
custom
on
the
whole
unchanged
according
to
xiv
seq
the
tithe
of
the
produce
of
the
soil
or
its
equivalent
in
money
must
be
brought
year
by
year
to
the
sanctuary
and
there
consumed
before
jehovah
that
is
as
a
sacrificial
meal
only
every
third
year
it
is
not
to
be
offered
in
jerusalem
but
is
to
be
given
as
alms
to
the
people
of
the
locality
who
have
no
land
to
which
category
the
levites
in
particular
belong
this
last
application
is
an
innovation
connected
on
the
one
hand
with
the
abolition
of
the
sanctuaries
and
on
the
other
with
the
tendency
of
the
deuteronomist
to
utilise
festal
mirth
for
humane
ends

however
possible

some

custom

as

assumed

this
is
a
mere
trifle
compared
with
what

the
whole
tithe
has
become
a
mere
due
to
be
collected
by
the
levites
nehemiah

of
the
clergy
whose
endowment
thereby
is

very
largely

silent
on

point

as
the
tithe
is
demanded
in

was
it
paid

was
added
over

as
to
meet
the
divergent
requirement
of

was
consumed
at

in

was
given
to
the
poor

it
is
absolutely
astounding
that
the
tithe

its
proper
nature
should
apply
only
to
products
of
definite
measure
such
as

comes
to
be
extended
in

so
that
besides
the
male
firstlings
every
tenth
head
of
cattle
and
of
sheep
must
also
be
paid
to
the

this
demand
however
is
not
yet
met
with
in
numbers

even
in

but
first
occurs
as
a
novel
in

whether
it
ever
came
into
the
actual
practice
of
judaism
seems
doubtful
in

the
tithe
of

is
indeed
mentioned
but
on
the
other
hand
the
firstlings
are
not
in
the
literature
no
traces
of
it
are
discoverable
especially
not
in

knows
only
of
the

tithes

reduced

through

this
is
no
doubt
the
reason
why
in
the
jehovistic
legislation
tithe
and
first
fruits
are
not
both
demanded

only
a
gift

be

in

not
in
a
mountainous
country

where
territory
that

thus
geometrically

where
it

there
too
the

was
already
under
cultivation
as
the
israelites
slowly
conquered
it
in
the
course
of
centuries
besides
from
the

of

there
is
not
a

in

the

were
scattered
throughout

in

a
manner
that

had
its
own
levites
or

did
they
live
separated
from

of

in

masses
together
for
they
made
their
living
by
sacrificing
for
others
and
without
a
community
they
could
not
exercise
their

some
indeed
possessed

were
at

and
at
a

also
at

anathoth
for
example
was
not
on
that
account
a
priestly
city
in
the
sense
of
joshua

jeremiah
had
his

as

with

precisely
by

even
after

exile
indeed
matters
were
not
different
in
this
respect
ab
excidio
templi
prioris
sublatum
est
levitis
jus
suburbiorum
says
nachman
sotah
and
he
is
borne
out
by
the
silence
of
nehemiah
x
the
execution
of
the
law
was
probably
postponed
to
the
days
of
the
messiah
it
was
not
in
truth
within
the
power
of
man
and
can
not
be
seriously
demanded
in
the
priestiy
code
itself
which
contemplates
a
purely
ideal
israel
with
ideal
boundaries
and
leaves
the
sober
reality
so
far
out
of
sight
that
on
archaeological
grounds
it
never
once
so
much
as
mentions
jerusalem
the
historical
capital
of
the
priests
the
circumstance
that
these
towns
lay
partibus
seems
to
make
them
unavailable
as
a
means
of
fixing
the
antiquity
of
the
priestly
code
it
is
possible
with
bleek
to
explain
the
transcendence
of
history
as
mosaicity
such
a
view
is
not
to
be
argued
against
but
it
is
also
possible
with
noldeke
to
insist
that
an
invention
so
bold
can
not
possibly
be
imputed
to
the
spirit
of
the
exilic
and
time
which
in
everything
is
only
anxiously
concerned
to
cleave
to
what
is
old
and
to
restore
it
and
such
a
contention
deserves
and
admits
of
refutation
it
is
not
the
case
that
the
jews
had
any
profound
respect
for
their
ancient
history
rather
they
condemned
the
whole
earlier
development
and
allowed
only
the
mosaic
time
along
with
its
davidic
reflex
to
stand
in
other
words
not
history
but
the
ideal
the
theocratic
ideal
was
from
the
exile
onwards
the
centre
of
all
thought
and
effort
and
it
annihilated
the
sense
for
objective
truth
all
regard
and
interest
for
the
actual
facts
as
they
had
been
handed
down
it
is
well
known
that
there
never
have
been
more
audacious
than
the
rabbins
but
chronicles
affords
evidence
sufficient
that
this
evil
propensity
goes
back
to
a
very
early
time
its
root
the
dominating
influence
of
the
law
being
the
root
of
judaism
itself
judaism
is
just
the
right
soil
for
such
an
artificial
growth
as
the
priestly
and
levitical
cities
it
would
hardly
have
occurred
to
an
author
living
in
the
monarchical
period
when
the
continuity
of
the
older
history
was
still
unbroken
to
look
so
completely
away
from
all
the
conditions
of
the
then
existing
reality
had
he
done
so
he
would
have
produced
upon
his
contemporaries
the
impression
merely
that
he
had
scarcely
all
his
wits
about
him
but
after
the
exile
had
annihilated
the
ancient
israel
and
violently
and
completely
broken
the
old
connection
with
the
ancient
conditions
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
from
planting
and
partitioning
the
in
thought
at
pleasure
just
as
geographers
are
wont
to
do
with
their
map
as
long
as
the
countries
are
unknown
but
of
course
no
fancy
is
pure
fancy
every
imagination
has
underlying
it
some
elements
of
reality
by
which
it
can
be
laid
hold
of
even
should
these
only
be
certain
prevailing
notions
of
a
particular
period
it
is
clear
if
a
proper
territory
is
assigned
to
the
clergy
that
the
notion
of
the
clerical
tribe
which
already
had
begun
to
strike
root
in
deuteronomy
has
here
grown
and
gathered
strength
to
such
a
degree
that
even
the
last
and
differentiating
distinction
is
abolished
which
separates
the
actual
tribes
from
the
levites
viz
communal
independence
and
the
degree
of
concentration
which
expresses
itself
in
separate
settlements
for
when
we
read
notwithstanding
in
the
priestly
code
that
aaron
and
levi
are
to
have
no
lot
nor
inheritance
in
israel
numbers
xviii
this
is
merely
a
form
of
speech
taken
over
from
deuteronomy
and
at
the
same
time
an
involuntary
concession
to
fact
what
would
the
cities
have
been
had
they
actually
existed
if
not
a
lot
a
territorial
possession
and
that
too
a
comparatively
large
one
the
general
basis
which
serves
as
for
the
historical
fiction
being
thus
far
recognisable
we
are
able
also
to
gain
a
closer
view
of
its
concrete
material
the
priestly
and
levitical
cities
stand
in
close
connection
with
the
cities
of
refuge
these
are
also
appointed
in
deuteronomy
xix
although
not
enumerated
by
name
for
deuteronomy
iv
can
not
be
regarded
as
genuine
originally
the
altars
were
asylums
exodus
xxi
ii
some
in
a
higher
degree
than
others
exodus
xxi
in
order
not
to
abolish
the
asylums
also
along
with
the
altars
the
deuteronomic
legislator
desired
that
certain
holy
places
should
continue
as
places
of
refuge
primarily
three
for
judah
to
which
when
the
territory
of
the
kingdom
extended
three
others
were
to
be
afterwards
added
the
priestly
code
adopts
the
arrangement
and
specifies
three
definite
cities
on
this
side
and
three
on
the
other

but
as
all
these
asylums
are
at
the
same
time
priestly
and
levitical
cities
it
is
an
obvious
conjecture
that
these
also
in
like
manner
arose
out
of
old
sanctuaries
we
need
not
suppose
that
there
is
more
in
this
than
an
echo
of
the
general
recollection
that
there
were
once
in
israel
many
holy
places
and
residences
of
priesthoods
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
to
assert
that
each
of
the
towns
enumerated
in
joshua
xxi
had
actually
been
an
ancient
sanctuary
in
many
cases
however
this
also
admits
of
being
shown

also
rimmon

the
names
not
even
here
can
one
venture
to
credit
the
priestly
code
with
consistent
fidelity
to
history
as
for
hosea
the
original
meaning
seems
to
be
a
snare
have
ye
become
for
mizpah

an
outspread
net

tabor
and
the

shittim
xt
h
have
they
made
deep
shittim
as
a
under

and
joshua
must
certainly
have
been
a
sanctuary
just
like
kadesh
gilgal
and
shiloh
the
prophet
names
these
seats
at
which
in
his
opinion
the
worship
was
especially
seductive
and
his
reproach
is
levelled
at
the
priests
most
famous
or
according
to
the
later
view
infamous
high
places
such
as
bethel
dan
gilgal
and
beersheba
are
omitted
probably
of
set
purpose
the
immediate
however
for
this
territorial
donation
to
the
levites
is
perhaps
to
be
sought
in
ezekiel
in
the
picture
of
the
future
israel
which
he
draws
at
the
close
of
his
book
he
concerns
himself
there
in
a
manner
about
the
demarcation
of
the
national
and
tribal
boundaries
and
in
doing
so
sets
quite
freely
to
work
taking
so
to
speak
the
yard
measure
in
his
hand
leaving
the
land
eastward
of
jordan
wholly
to
the
saracens
he
divides
the
western
portion
into
thirteen
parallel
transverse
sections
in
the
middle

the
rest
of

is
assigned

the

give
up
a

this

is
divided
into
three
parallelograms

running
east
and

the
southernmost
of
these
ells
broad
includes
the

its

the

contains
the

the

in

thus
we
have
here
also
a
surrender
of
land
to
the
clergy
on
the
part
of
the
tribes
the
comparison
with
josh
xxi
is
not
to
be
put
aside
all
the
less
because
nowhere
else
in
the
old
testament
is
anything
similar
met
with
now
ezekiel
is
quite
transparent
and
requires
no
interpreter
but
himself
in
order
that
the
temple
may
be
protected
in
its
sanctity
in
the
best
possible
manner
it
is
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
priestly
territory
which
in
its
turn
is
covered
by
the
city
on
the
south
and
by
the
levites
on
the
north
at
the
same
time
the
connected
with
the
function
of
worship
is
to
dwell
as
much
as
possible
apart
on
its
own
soil
and
territory
which
serve
them
for
separate
houses
to
sanctify
as
is
expressly
remarked
for
the
priests
xiv
and
in
an
inferior
degree
holds
good
also
of
course
for
the
levites
beside
them
here
everything
starts
from
and
has
its
explanation
in
the
temple
its
original
is
unmistakably
the
temple
of
solomon
its
site
is
beside
the
capital
in
the
heart
of
the
sacred
centre
of
the
land
between
judah
and
benjamin
there
the
sons
of
zadok
have
their
abode
and
beside
them
are
the
levites
whom
josiah
had
brought
up
from
all
the
country
to
jerusalem
obviously
the
motives
are
not
here
far
to
seek
in
the
priestly
code
on
the
other
hand
which
was
not
in
a
position
to
shape
the
future
freely
out
of
the
present
but
was
compelled
to
accept
archaeological
restrictions
the
motives
are
historically
concealed
and
almost
paralysed
the
result
has
remained
namely
the
holding
of
separate
territory
by
the
clergy
but
the
cause
or
the
purpose
of
it
can
no
longer
be
recognised
on
account
of
the
sanctuary
being
now
an
abstract
idea
jerusalem
and
the
temple
which
properly
speaking
occasioned
the
whole
arrangement
are
buried
in
silence
with
a
diligence
which
is
in
the
highest
degree
surprising
and
on
the
other
hand
in
remembrance
of
the
priesthoods
scattered
everywhere
among
the
high
places
of
israel
in
earlier
days
fresh
levitical
cities
are
created
from
which
however
their
proper
focus
a
temple
to
wit
is
withheld
only
in
the
circumstance
that
precisely
the
thirteen
cities
of
judah
and
benjamin
happen
to
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
sons
of
aaron
does
the
influence
of
jerusalem
unconsciously
betray
itself
apart
from
this
historical
fiction
the
other
claims
that
are
made
for
the
endowment
of
the
clergy
are
however
exorbitant
nevertheless
practicable
and
seriously
meant
so
far
as
the
circumstances
of
their
origin
are
concerned
two
possibilities
present
themselves
either
the
priests
demanded
what
they
could
hope
to
obtain
in
which
case
they
were
actually
supreme
over
the
nation
or
they
set
up
claims
which
at
the
time
were
neither
justified
nor
even
possible
in
which
case
they
were
not
indeed
quite
sober
yet
at
the
same
time
so
sane
prophetically
that
centuries
afterwards
the
revenues
they
dreamed
of
became
in
actuality
theirs
is
it
to
be
supposed
that
it
was
say
moses
who
encouraged
his
people
as
they
were
struggling
for
bare
life
in
the
wilderness
to
concern
themselves
about
a
superabundantly
rich
endowment
of
their
clergy
or
is
it
believed
that
it
was
in
the
period
of
the
judges
when
the
individual
tribes
and
families
of
israel
after
having
forced
their
way
among
the
canaanites
had
a
hard
fight
to
maintain
their
position
get
somehow
settled
in
their
new
and
surroundings
that
the
thought
first
arose
of
exacting
such
taxes
from
a
people
that
was
only
beginning
to
grow
into
a
national
unity
for
an
end
that
was
altogether
remote
from
its
interest
what
power
could
then
have
been
able
in
those
days
when
every
man
did
what
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
to
compel
the
individual
to
pay
but
even
when
actually
under
the
pressure
of
circumstances
a
political
organisation
had
arisen
which
embraced
all
the
tribes
it
could
hardly
have
occurred
to
the
priests
to
utilise
the
secular
arm
as
a
means
for
giving
to
themselves
a
place
of
sovereignty
and
still
less
could
they
have
succeeded
without
the
king
on
whom
they
were
so
completely
dependent
in
short
the
claims
they
make
in
the
law
would
in
the
period
have
been
regarded
as
utopian
in
the
strict
sense
of
that
word
they
allow
of
explanation
only
by
the
circumstances
which
from
the
beginning
of
the
chaldaean
rule
and
still
more
that
of
the
persians
lent
themselves
to
the
formation
of
a
hierocracy
to
which
as
to
the
truly
national
and
moreover
divine
authority
the
people
gave
voluntary
obedience
and
to
which
the
persians
also
conceded
rights
they
could
not
have
granted
to
the
family
of
david
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
exile
ezekiel
begins
to
augment
the
revenues
of
the
priests
xliv
yet
he
still
confines
himself
on
the
whole
to
the
lines
of
deuteronomy
and
makes
no
mention
of
tithes
and
firstlings
of
the
demands
of
the
priestly
code
in
their
full
extent
we
hear
historically
in
nehemiah
for
the
first
time
there
it
is
stated
that
they
were
carried
through
by
men
who
had
the
authority
of
artaxerxes
behind
them
this
was
the
most
difficult
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
important
part
of
the
work
ezra
and
nehemiah
had
to
do
in
introducing
the
pentateuch
as
the
law
of
the
jewish
church
and
that
is
the
reason
why
it
is
so
specially
and
minutely
spoken
of
here
plainly
lies
the
material
basis
of
the
hierocracy
from
which
the
royal
throne
was
ultimately
reached
for
all
these
dues
apart
from
sacrificial
perquisites
flowed
into
a
common
coffer
and
benefited
those
who
had
the
control
of
this
the
priestly
aristocracy
of
jerusalem
whom
it
helped
to
rise
to
a
truly
princely
position
the
ordinary
priests
and
especially
the
levites
did
not
gain
by
all
this
wealth
the
latter
indeed
ought
according
to
law
to
have
had
the
tithes
and
to
have
handed
over
the
tithes
of
these
again
to
the
sons
of
aaron
but
as
the
general
tendency
of
the
time
was
to
depress
the
levites
this
legal
revenue
was
also
gradually
withdrawn
from
them
and
appropriated
by
the
priests
afterwards
the
chief
priests
claimed
the
tithes
for
themselves
alone
while
their
inferior
brethren
had
to
suffer
severe
privation
and
even
hunger
itself

upon
the
difference
just
stated
between
the
later
practice
and
the
law
one
argument
more
has
recently
been
founded
against
assigning
the
latter
to
the
period
another
testimony
borne
by
tradition
completely
excludes
the
idea
of
the
elohistic
torah
the
priestly
code
having
been
composed
by
ezra
as
is
well
known
it
is
the
elohistic
torah
that
carefully
regulates
the
mutual
relations
of
priests
and
levites
while
deuteronomy
groups
the
two
together
without
bringing
forward
the
distinction
it
is
the
former
that
assigns
the
tithes
to
the
levites
while
requiring
these
in
their
turn
to
hand
over
the
tithe
of
their
tithes
as
a
due
to
the
priests
such
was
also
the
practice
nehemiah
x
seq
soon
after
the
exile
a
hundred
years
later
nehemiah
vii
but
subsequently
the
payment
of
the
tithes
to
the
levites
fell
entirely
into
disuse
these
were
rendered
immediately
and
exclusively
to
the
priests
so
that
jose
ben
hanina
actually
confesses
we
do
not
pay
the
tithes
according
to
the
command
of
god
sota
but
everywhere
the
talmud
refers
this
practice
back
to
ezra
ezra
it
was
who
punished
the
levites
by
withdrawal
of
the
tithes
and
that
because
they
had
not
come
out
from
babylon
jebam
chullin
the
point
to
be
noted
is
that
ezra
according
to
the
testimony
of
tradition
superseded
a
precept
of
the
elohistic
torah
supporting
himself
in
this
perhaps
by
reference
to
the
deuteronomic
torah
so
delitzsch
in
the
zeitschr
fuer
luth
seq
that
ezra
is
not
the
author
of
the
priestly
code
may
readily
be
granted
only
not
on
such
an
argument
as
this
if
the
genuine
historical
tradition
expressly
names
ezra
as
the
man
who
introduced
the
levites
tithe
just
as
prescribed
by
law
nehemiah
x
seq
what
conscientious
man
can
attach
any
weight
to
the
opposite
assertion
of
the
talmud
but
even
assuming
that
the
divergence
of
practice
from
the
legal
statute
actually
does
go
back
to
the
time
of
ezra
what
would
follow
from
that
against
the
origin
of
the
priestly
code
for
this
is
what
the
question
comes
to
not
to
authorship
which
is
made
the
main
point
by
a
mere
piece
of
transparent
controversial
tactics
the
demands
of
the
priestly
code
which
demonstrably
were
neither
laid
down
nor
in
any
sense
acted
on
before
the
exile
attained
the
force
of
law
one
hundred
years
after
the
return
from
babylon
nehemiah
x
the
whole
taxation
system
of
judaism
ever
afterwards
rested
upon
it
shall
this
be
held
to
have
no
meaning
as
against
the
trifling
circumstance
that
the
tithe
also
was
indeed
paid
to
the
clergy
in
full
accordance
with
the
priestly
code
and
inconsistently
with
ancient
custom
but
paid
to
the
higher
and
not
to
the
lower
order
in
point
of
fact
any
other
difference
whatever
between
jewish
practice
and
the
law
might
better
have
been
adduced
against
the
thesis
of
graf
for
example
the
absence
of
urim
and
thummim
nehemiah
vii
or
of
the
levitical
cities
the
church
of
the
returned
exiles
instead
of
that
of
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
the
second
temple
instead
of
the
tabernacle
ezra
instead
of
moses
the
sons
of
zadok
instead
of
the
sons
of
aaron
the
absence
of
the
other
marks
of
mosaicity
for
the
position
of
the
levites
is
the
achilles
heel
of
the
priestly
code
if
the
levites
at
a
later
date
were
still
further
lowered
beneath
the
priests
and
put
into
a
worse
position
in
favour
of
these
this
nevertheless
presupposes
the
distinction
between
the
two
let
it
first
then
be
shown
that
the
distinction
is
known
to
the
genuine
old
testament
and
that
in
particular
it
is
introduced
by
ezekiel
not
as
a
new
thing
but
as
of
immemorial
antiquity
or
is
the
primary
fact
that
the
separation
between
priests
and
levites
was
set
up
only
in
the
priestly
code
and
in
judaism
and
that
its
genesis
can
be
traced
with
confidence
from
the
time
of
josiah
downwards
a
fact
of
less
importance
than
the
secondary
one
that
the
distinction
extended
itself
somewhat
further
still
in
the
subsequent
development
of
judaism

under

originally
derived

very
variously
apprehended

shaped

way
in

ninth
and

centuries
another

the

show
the

arrangement
as
do
those
of

and
here
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
tradition
be
legendary
or
historical
whether
it
relates
to
or
to
historic
times
the
change
in
the
prevailing
ideas
shows
itself
equally
in
either
case
to
show
the
truth
of
this
in
the
case
of
the
hexateuch
is
of
course
our
primary
object
but
we
make
our
commencement
rather
with
the
properly
historical
books
for
on
various
grounds
we
are
here
able
with
greater
certainty
to
assert
such
was
the
aspect
of
history
at
this
period
and
such
at
that
such
were
the
influences
that
had
the
ascendancy
at
one
time
and
such
those
which
prevailed
at
another
we
begin
the
inquiry
where
the
matter
is
clearest
namely
with
the
book
of
chronicles
chronicles
which
properly
speaking
forms
but
a
single
book
along
with
ezra
and
nehemiah
is
a
second
history
running
parallel
with
the
books
of
samuel
and
kings
and
we
are
here
in
the
favourable
position
of
starting
with
the
objects
of
comparison
distinctly
defined
instead
of
having
as
usual
to
begin
by
a
critical
separation
of
sources
of
various
age
combined
in
one
document
and
what
is
more
we
can
also
date
the
rival
histories
with
tolerable
certainty
the
books
of
samuel
and
of
kings
were
edited
in
the
babylonian
exile
chronicles
on
the
other
hand
was
composed
fully
three
hundred
years
later
after
the
downfall
of
the
persian
empire
out
of
the
very
midst
of
fully
developed
judaism
we
shall
now
proceed
to
show
that
the
mere
difference
of
date
fully
accounts
for
the
varying
ways
in
which
the
two
histories
represent
the
same
facts
and
events
and
the
difference
of
spirit
arises
from
the
influence
of
the
priestly
code
which
came
into
existence
in
the
interval

critical
essay
on
the

of
the
books

is
throughout
taken
as
the
basis
of
the
discussion
that
essay
has
not
been
improved
on
by
graf
gesch
bucher
seq
for
here
the
difficulty
better
grappled
with
by
the
former
is
not
to
collect
the
details
of
evidence
but
so
to
shape
the
superabundant
material
as
to
convey
a
right
total
impression
after
jehovah
had
slain
saul
so
begins
the
narrative
of
chronicles
he
turned
the
kingdom
unto
david
the
son
of
jesse
all
israel
gathered
themselves
unto
david
to
hebron
and
anointed
him
king
over
israel
according
to
the
word
of
jehovah
by
samuel
i
chronicles
x
how
simply
and
smoothly
and
wholly
without
human
intervention
according
to
this
version
did
the
thing
come
to
pass
quite
otherwise
is
it
in
the
narrative
of
the
book
of
samuel
this
also
indeed
has
the
statement
of
chronicles
word
for
word
but
it
has
something
over
and
above
which
gives
a
quite
different
aspect
to
the
matter
here
david
on
the
lowest
step
to
the
throne
is
the
guerilla
leader
in
the
wilderness
of
judah
who
finally
is
compelled
by
saul
persecutions
to
pass
over
to
philistine
territory
there
under
the
protection
of
the
enemies
of
his
nation
carrying
on
his
freebooter
life
after
the
battle
of
gilboa
he
avails
himself
of
the
dissolution
of
the
kingdom
to
set
up
a
separate
principality
in
the
south
as
a
vassal
of
the
philistines
he
is
not
chosen
but
comes
with
a
following
six
hundred
strong
and
offers
himself
to
the
elders
of
judah
whom
he
has
already
at
an
earlier
period
laid
under
obligations
to
him
by
various
favours
and
gifts
in
the
meantime
saul
cousin
abner
takes
over
what
of
the
kingdom
there
is
not
for
himself
but
for
the
legitimate
heir
ishbaal
from
gilead
whither
the
government
had
been
transferred
after
the
great
catastrophe
he
gradually
reconquers
the
territory
west
of
jordan
and
is
scheming
how
to
recover
also
the
lost
judah
thus
it
comes
to
protracted
struggles
between
abner
and
david
in
which
fortune
is
most
on
the
side
of
the
latter
yet
he
does
not
leave
the
defensive
or
gain
the
sovereignty
over
israel
that
falls
into
his
hands
rather
by
treachery
abner
himself
indignant
at
the
ingratitude
of
his
royal
nephew
offers
the
crown
to
his
rival
and
enters
into
negotiations
with
him
about
it
but
as
he
immediately
afterwards
falls
a
victim
to
blood
revenge
nothing
comes
of
the
matter
until
ishbaal
is
privily
murdered
in
his
sleep
by
two
of
his
captains
then
at
last
the
elders
of
israel
come
to
hebron
and
david
becomes
king
in
succession
to
saul
what
a
length
of
time
these
affairs
demand
how
natural
is
their
development
how
many
human
elements
mingle
in
their
course
cunning
and
treachery
and
battle
and
murder
chronicles
indeed
knows
them
all
well
enough
as
is
clear
from
incidental
expressions
in
chaps
xi
and
but
they
are
passed
over
in
silence
immediately
after
his
predecessor
death
the
son
of
jesse
is
freely
chosen
by
all
israel
to
be
king
according
to
the
word
of
jehovah
by
samuel
the
sequence
of
x
xi
does
not
admit
of
being
understood
in
any
other
way
nor
is
it
in
point
of
fact
otherwise
understood
for
it
has
actually
been
successful
at
least
to
this
extent
that
the
kingship
of
ishbaal
has
virtually
dropped
out
of
traditional
bible
history
after
saul
came
david
is
what
is
said
we
have
before
us
a
deliberate
and
in
its
motives
a
very
transparent
mutilation
of
the
original
narrative
as
preserved
for
us
in
the
book
of
samuel
as
all
israel
has
made
david
the
successor
of
saul
and
all
israel
gone
out
with
him
to
the
conquest
of
jerusalem
xi
in
we
hear
only
of
david
following
so
now
immediately
afterwards
the
noblest
representatives
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
who
even
before
he
had
attained
the
throne
were
in
sympathy
and
indeed
already
on
his
side
are
enumerated
by
name
and
numbers
in
three
lists
xi
which
are
introduced
between
what
is
said
in
and
in
seq
the
first
xi
these
are
the
mighty
men
who
took
part
with
him
with
all
israel
to
make
him
king
is
the
list
of
which
the
chronicler
as
he
betrays
in
chaps
was
acquainted
with
as
it
stood
in
that
place
and
here
gives
much
too
early
for
it
is
for
the
most
part
warriors
of
david
later
campaigns
who
are
enumerated
the
second
list
xii
the
division
into
a
group
of
three
and
another
of
thirty

corruption
of
the

text
der
bb
sam
has
not
been
understood
by
the
chronicler
and
thus
been
made
quite
unrecognisable
in
this
way
he
has
been
able
to
bring
in
at
the
end
xi
a
string
of
additional
names
exceeding
the
number
of
thirty
in
ver
his
style
unmistakably
betrays
itself
wherever
it
may
be
that
he
met
with
the
elements
these
are
they
that
came
to
david
to
ziklag
while
he
yet
kept
himself
close
because
of
saul
is
not
taken
from
the
book
of
samuel
but
one
also
observes
this
difference
along
with
old
and
genuine
there
are
extremely
common
names
and
hardly
one
that
occurs
here
only
the
notes
of
ancestry
carefully
given
in
chap
xi
are
almost
always
wanting
and
instead
of
performing
before
our
eyes
such
deeds
as
the
rescue
of
a
field
of
barley
from
the
enemy
the
purchase
of
a
draught
of
water
with
blood
the
slaying
of
a
lion
in
a
pit
the
heroes
receive
all
sorts
of
xii
and
titles
of
honour
xii
and
ordinarily
talk
a
highly
spiritual
language
xii
and
as
for
the
historical
situation
how
impossible
that
a
great
israelite
army
should
have
been
gathered
around
david
as
the
feudatory
of
the
philistines
in
ziklag
xii
with
a
crowd
of
captains
of
hundreds
and
thousands

the
banished

according
to
this
representation
the
splendid
king
and
illustrious
ancestor
of
the
established
dynasty
hence
also
the
naive
remark
of
ver
no
better
is
it
with
the
third
list
xii
these
are
the
numbers
of
the
bands
ready
armed
for
the
war
who
came
to
david
to
hebron
observe
the
regular
enumeration
of
the
twelve
tribes
which
nowhere
occurs
in
the
older
historical
books
and
is
quite
artificial
then
the
vast
numbers
which
are
not
matters
of
indifference
here
but
the
principal
thing
and
make
up
the
entire
contents
finally
the
levites
and
priests
who
also
take
their
place
in
the
martial
train
and
constitute
the
proper
guard
of
the
king
to
chronicles
the
distinction
between
secular
and
spiritual
soldiers
is
not
altogether
clear
there
are
but
a
few
details
of
a
special
kind
the
remark
in
xii
is
perhaps
connected
with
xx
jehoiada
the
prince
of
the
house
of
aaron
the
high
priest
alongside
of
the
historically
certain
series
eli
phinehas
ahitub
ahiah
ahimelech
abiathar
an
utterly
impossible
person
is
a
reflection
of
the
jehoiada
of
and
the
allegation
that
zadok
at
that
time
joined
david
at
the
head
of
chief
priests
is
a
hardly
credible
substitute
for
what
is
stated
in
samuel
according
to
which
abiathar
whose
older
claims
were
disagreeable
to
the
zadok
and
those
who
came
later
was
the
priest
who
from
the
beginning
held
with
david
the
chief
priests
appear
to
correspond
to
the
heads
of
the
priestly
families
nehemiah
xii
x
xxiv
yet
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
go
so
minutely
into
the
contents
of
the
above
lists
for
the
purpose
with
which
they
are
given
is
stated
without
circumlocution
at
the
close
xii
all
these
men
of
war
in
order
of
battle
came
with
a
perfect
heart
to
hebron
to
make
david
king
over
all
israel
and
all
the
rest
of
israel
also
were
of
one
heart
to
make
david
king
and
they
were
there
with
david
three
days
eating
and
drinking
for
there
was
joy
in
israel
after
the
explication
of
the
idea
all
israel
thus
inappropriately
interpolated
the
narrative
proceeds
to
reproduce
the
contents
of
samuel
david
first
deed
after
the
conquest
of
the
stronghold
of
jebus
is
in
chronicles
to
make
it
the
holy
city
by
transferring
the
ark
of
jehovah
thither
xiii
it
seems
as
if
the
building
of
a
palace
and
the
philistine
war
were
to
be
omitted
but
after
the
narrative
in
vi
seq
has
been
given
down
to
the
place
and
the
ark
of
jehovah
abode
in
the
house
of
three
months
xiii
vi
the
pause
of
a
quarter
of
a
year
is
utilised
for
the
purpose
of
overtaking
what
had
been
left
out
xiv
and
then
the
history
of
the
ark
is
completed
this
indeed
is
to
separate
things
mutually
connected
but
at
the
same
time
the
secular
business
which
according
to
the
older
narrative
is
the
nearest
and
most
pressing
is
reduced
to
the
level
of
a
mere
episode
in
the
midst
of
the
sacred
that
there
is
no
room
for
the
building
of
a
house
and
a
philistine
war
within
the
three
months
which
offer
themselves
so
conveniently
for
the
interpolation
is
a
subordinate
affair
as
regards
the
sacred
business
the
transference
of
the
ark
to
zion
almost
everything
that
is
said
in
vi
is
repeated
word
for
word
in
chronicles
also
xvii
two
traits
only
are
absent
in
chronicles
and
in
neither
case
is
the
omission
helpful
to
the
connection
david
wife
michal
it
is
said
in
vi
when
she
saw
the
king
dancing
and
leaping
in
the
procession
despised
him
in
her
heart
afterwards
when
he
came
home
she
told
him
what
she
thought
of
his
unworthy
conduct
the
first
of
these
two
statements
is
found
in
chronicles
also
xv
but
the
second
is
all
but
the
introductory
notice
xvi
vi
here
torn
from
its
connection
omitted
although
it
contains
the
principal
fact
for
the
historical
event
was
the
expression
of
her
contempt
not
its
psychological
origin
a
woman
such
is
the
idea
must
not
say
a
thing
like
that
to
david
the
other
case
is
quite
similar
on
account
of
the
calamity
by
which
those
who
were
bringing
up
the
ark
were
overtaken
david
does
not
at
first
venture
to
receive
it
into
his
citadel
but
deposits
it
in
the
house
of
one
of
his
captains
but
when
jehovah
blesses
the
house
of
he
takes
courage
to
bring
the
ark
to
his
own
home
vi
chronicles
also
tells
that
jehovah
blessed
the
house
of
xiii
but
mentions
no
consequent
result
again
the
cause
is
given
without
the
effect
another
explanation
is
substituted
david
perceived
that
the
disaster
connected
with
the
removal
of
the
ark
was
due
to
the
fact
of
its
not
having
been
carried
by
the
levites
in
accordance
with
the
law
the
levites
accordingly
were
made
to
bear
it
and
no
harm
ensued
xv
this
is
in
complete
and
manifest
contradiction
to
the
older
narrative
and
as
chronicles
chapter
xiii
copies
that
narrative
it
also
contradicts
itself
xiii
and
that
all
the
more
strikingly
as
by
the
addition
in
xiii
it
represents
the
accompanying
clergy
as
tacitly
approving
the
carrying
of
the
ark
on
the
then
due
participation
in
the
sacred
procession
having
been
thus
once
secured
them
xv
positively
revels
in
priests
and
levites
of
whom
not
a
sing
e
word
is
to
be
found
in
samuel
and
moreover
a
sort
of
musical
service
is
instituted
by
david
himself
before
the
ark
and
a
festal
cantata
made
up
by
him
out
of
psalms
is
quoted
chapter
in
this
way
out
of
the
original
narrative
the
scattered
fragments
of
which
now
show
themselves
very
strangely
in
the
new
connection
something
quite
different
has
grown
in
the
former
everything
is
free
simply
the
affair
of
king
and
people
here
all
is
priestly
ceremonial
there
the
people
with
their
king
shout
and
dance
with
joy
before
the
ark
here
the
levites
are
the
musicians
and
singers
in
formal
order
to
seek
to
combine
the
two
versions
is
wholly
against
the
laws
of
historical
interpretation
if
the
first
were
curt
and
condensed
the
unification
of
the
two
might
perhaps
be
possible
but
no
story
could
be
more
particular
or
graphic
and
could
it
have
been
that
the
levites
alone
should
be
passed
over
in
silence
if
they
had
played
so
very
important
a
part
the
author
of
chronicles
was
able
to
introduce
them
only
by
distorting
and
mutilating
his
original
and
landing
himself
in
contradiction
after
all
he
can
not
allow
anything
to
happen
without
levites
and
was
the
ark
of
the
covenant
to
be
fetched
to
jerusalem
without
them
was
the
law
to
be
even
a
second
time
broken
under
the
pious
king
david
this
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
uzzah
perished
in
the
first
attempt
to
fetch
the
ark
and
that
on
the
second
occasion
when
only
a
quite
short
journey
is
spoken
of
the
ark
was
carried
vi
may
have
been
the
suggestions
by
which
he
was
led
fertile
in
combinations
he
profited
by
the
hint
so
justly
de
wette
beitraege
i
the
narrative
of
vi
having
been
broken
off
at
the
first
half
of
ver
xvi
the
second
half
of
the
verse
and
the
beginning
of
the
next
are
reproduced
xvi
after
the
interpolation
of
xvi
and
then
vii
is
appended
word
for
word
xvii
the
resolution
of
david
to
build
a
house
for
the
ark
and
what
jehovah
said
to
him
about
the
subject
through
nathan
the
point
of
the
prophet
address
turns
on
the
antithesis
thou
wilt
build
a
house
for
me
rather
will
i
build
a
house
for
thee
the
house
of
david
is
of
course
the
davidic
dynasty
but
an
interpolation
has
already
crept
into
the
text
of
samuel
vii
which
apprehends
the
antithesis
thus
thou
wilt
build
a
house
for
me
nay
thy
son
shall
build
a
house
for
me
now
chronicles
for
which
david
comes
into
consideration
merely
as
the
proper
founder
of
the
solomonic
temple
takes
up
the
narrative
of
samuel
vii
precisely
on
account
of
this
interpolation
as
is
clear
from
xxii
increases
the
misunderstanding
by
going
back
to
it
in
an
addition
xvii
and
at
the
outset
destroys
the
original
antithesis
by
the
innocent
alteration
thou
shalt
not
build
the
house
for
me
instead
of
wilt
thou
build
a
house
for
me
the
house
can
here
mean
only
that
imperatively
needed
one
long
kept
in
view
alike
by
god
and
men
which
must
by
all
means
he
built
only
not
by
david
but
by
solomon
it
is
without
any
ambiguity
the
temple
and
does
not
like
a
house
contain
that
possibility
of
a
double
meaning
on
which
the
original
point
depends
it
is
interesting
also
to
compare
vii
with
xvii
i
will
be
to
thy
seed
a
father
and
he
shall
be
to
me
a
son
he
commit
iniquity
then
i
will
chasten
him
with
the
rod
of
men
and
with
the
stripes
of
the
sons
of
men
my
mercy
shall
not
depart
from
him
the
words
in
italics
are
wanting
in
chronicles
the
meaning
that
jehovah
will
not
withdraw
his
grace
from
the
dynasty
of
judah
altogether
even
though
some
of
its
members
should
deserve
punishment
is
thereby
destroyed
and
volatilised
into
an
abstract
idealism
which
shows
that
to
the
writer
the
davidic
kingly
family
is
known
only
as
a
dissolving
view
and
not
by
historical
experience
as
it
is
to
the
author
of
vii
in
chaps
chronicles
seems
to
refresh
itself
with
a
little
variety
relating
as
it
does
the
foreign
wars
of
david
after
the
order
of
xi
xii
xxi
but
in
this
it
still
keeps
in
view
its
purpose
which
is
directed
towards
david
as
founder
of
the
jerusalem
worship
those
wars
brought
him
the
wealth
that
was
required
for
the
building
of
the
temple
on
the
other
hand
everything
so
fully
and
beautifully
told
in
the
book
of
samuel
about
the
home
occurrences
of
that
period
is
omitted
for
after
all
it
does
not
contribute
much
to
the
glorification
of
the
king
so
the
story
of
meribaal
and
ziba
chap
ix
of
bathsheba
and
uriah
xii
of
tamar
and
amnon
xiv
of
rebellion
and
of
the
of
the
sons
of
saul
xxi
the
rude
and
mechanical
manner
in
which
statements
about
foreign
wars
are
torn
from
the
connection
with
domestic
events
in
which
they
stand
in
the
older
narrative
is
shown
in
xx
as
compared
with
xi
xii
in
xi
the
mention
of
the
fact
that
david
remained
in
jerusalem
when
the
army
set
out
against
rabbah
prepares
for
the
story
of
his
adultery
with
the
wife
of
a
captain
engaged
in
active
service
in
the
field
but
xx
is
meaningless
and
involves
a
contradiction
with
ver
according
to
which
david
appears
after
all
in
the
camp
at
rabbah
although
the
connection
namely
that
he
followed
the
army
and
all
the
intermediate
occurrences
relating
to
bathsheba
and
uriah
are
left
out
de
wette
pp
to
what
extent
the
veil
is
drawn
over
the
scandalous
falls
of
saints
may
be
judged
also
from
the
fact
that
from
the
list
of
david
foreign
encounters
also
which
are
otherwise
fully
given
a
single
one
is
omitted
which
he
is
supposed
not
to
have
come
through
with
absolute
honour
that
with
the
giant
xxi
lastly
the
alteration
made
in
xx
is
remarkable
elhanan
the
son
of
jair
of
bethlehem
we
read
in
xxi
was
he
who
slew
goliath
of
gath
the
shaft
of
whose
spear
was
as
thick
as
a
weaver
beam
but
on
the
other
hand
had
not
david
of
bethlehem
according
to
xvii
vanquished
goliath
the
giant
the
shaft
of
whose
spear
was
as
thick
as
a
weaver
beam
in
chronicles
accordingly
elhanan
smites
the
brother
of
the
veritable
goliath
the
closing
chapters
of
are
admittedly
an
appendix
of
very
peculiar
structure
the
thread
of
xxi
is
continued
in
xxiv
but
in
the
interval
between
the
two
passages
occurs
xxi
in
a
very
irrational
manner
perhaps
wholly
due
to
chance
in
this
interposed
passage
itself
again
the
quite
similar
lists
xxi
and
xxiii
are
very
closely
connected
and
the
two
songs
xxii
xxiii
are
thus
an
interpolation
within
an
interpolation
this
want
of
order
is
imitated
by
the
author
of
chronicles
also
who
takes
xxiii
as
separated
from
xxi
and
gives
xxiv
last
a
position
which
does
not
belong
to
it
from
any
material
considerations
but
merely
because
it
had
originally
been
tagged
on
as
an
appendix
and
besides
had
been
separated
from
its
connection
with
xxi
by
a
large
interpolation
xxi
the
pestilence
as
punishment
of
david
sin
in
numbering
the
people
and
the
theophany
as
occasioning
the
building
of
an
altar
on
the
of
araunah
is
on
the
whole
a
copy
of
but
with
omission
of
the
precise
and
interesting
geographical
details
of
ver
seq
and
with
introduction
of
a
variety
of
improving
touches
thus
xxi
and
satan
stood
up
against
israel
and
moved
david
instead
of
and
the
anger
of
jehovah
was
kindled
against
israel
and
he
moved
david
similarly
xxi
levi
and
benjamin
joab
counted
not
among
them
for
the
king
word
was
abominable
to
him
an
addition
which
finds
its
explanation
on
the
one
hand
in
numbers
i
and
on
the
other
in
the
circumstance
that
the
holy
city
lay
within
the
territory
of
benjamin
again
xxi
david
saw
the
angel
of
jehovah
standing
between
heaven
and
earth
and
his
sword
drawn
in
his
hand
and
stretched
out
towards
jerusalem
compare
this
with
sam
xxiv
xxi
the
angel
stretched
out
his
hand
to
jerusalem
to
destroy
it
and
he
was
by
the
threshing
floor
of
araunah
according
to
the
older
view
angels
have
no
wings
genesis
further
xxi
david
gave
to
araunah
for
his
shekels
of
gold
compare
with
xxiv
shekels
of
silver
to
make
the
king
pay
right
royally
costs
the
chronicler
nothing
but
lastly
his
most
significant
addition
is
the
fire
from
heaven
which
consumes
the
xxi
by
this
means
the
altar
on
the
of
araunah
in
other
words
that
of
the
sanctuary
of
jerusalem
is
intended
to
be
put
on
a
level
with
that
of
the
tabernacle
its
predecessor
the
fire
on
which
was
also
kindled
from
heaven
leviticus
ix
whoever
has
understood
the
narratives
of
by
the
patriarchs
by
joshua
gideon
and
manoah
will
grant
that
the
author
of
chronicles
has
quite
correctly
understood
the
intention
of
in
accordance
with
which
he
here
proposes
to
relate
the
divine
inauguration
of
the
place
of
worship
at
jerusalem
but
what
in
that
passage
as
in
similar
older
legends
about
the
indication
of
consecrated
places
by
means
of
a
theophany
is
only
hinted
at
for
contemporaries
who
understood
the
idea
conveyed
he
requires
to
retouch
strongly
in
order
that
a
later
generation
may
notice
it
and
yet
he
has
half
spoiled
the
point
by
making
the
angel
not
stand
by
the
of
araunah
on
the
sacred
spot
but
hover
aloft
in
the
air
xxiv
xxi
serves
further
as
a
starting
point
for
the
free
construction
of
the
circumstance
that
in
the
last
chapter
of
the
book
of
samuel
david
builds
the
altar
at
jerusalem
is
expanded
into
the
statement
that
in
the
last
year
of
his
reign
he
prepared
beforehand
the
building
of
the
temple
of
solomon
in
all
its
parts
down
to
the
minutest
detail
unhampered
by
historical
tradition
the
author
here
expatiates
with
absolute
freedom
in
his
proper
element
all
that
has
hitherto
been
said
about
the
king
on
the
basis
of
the
older
source
is
by
means
of
additions
and
omissions
fashioned
into
what
shall
serve
as
a
mere
prologue
to
the
proper
work
of
his
life
which
is
now
described
thoroughly
he
himself
unfortunately
has
not
been
allowed
to
build
the
house
having
shed
much
blood
and
carried
on
great
wars
xxii
xxviii
but
he
yet
in
the
last
year
of
his
reign
forestalls
from
his
successor
the
whole
merit
of
the
business
xxiii
xxviii
my
son
solomon
he
says
is
young
and
tender
but
the
house
to
be
built
for
jehovah
must
be
great
and
glorious
i
will
therefore

provides
the
material
stone

he
also
gives

receives
it

moses
built
the
tabernacle
only
according
to
his
recollection
of
the
heavenly
pattern
which
had
been
shown
to
him
on
sinai

before
all
he
appoints
the

temple
service
priests
levites
porters
singers
their
thousands
into
classes

assigns
to
them
their

as

an
inventory

none

and
in

long
discourse
hands
over
to
the

with
the

the
task
of
his
reign
namely
the
execution
of
what
he
himself
has
prepared

appointed

this
occasion

noble
metals
among
them
gold
of
ophir
and
persian
darics
are
presented
by
david
and
the
princes
for
the
sacred
building
the
whole
section
is
a
startling
instance
of
that
statistical
phantasy
of
the
jews
which
revels
in
vast
sums
of
money
on
paper
xxii
in
artificial
marshallings
of
names
and
numbers
in
the
enumeration
of
mere
subjects
without
predicates
which
simply
stand
on
parade
and
neither
signify
nor
do
anything
the
monotony
is
occasionally
broken
only
by
unctuous
phrases
but
without
refreshing
the
reader
let
the
experiment
of
reading
the
chapters
through
be
tried
according
to
king
david
in
his
closing
days
was
sick
and
feeble
in
body
and
mind
and
very
far
from
being
in
a
condition
thus
to
make
preparations
on
behalf
of
his
successor
shortly
before
his
own
death
or
to
prepare
his
bread
for
him
so
far
that
nothing
remained
but
to
put
it
into
the
oven
his
purpose
of
building
a
house
to
jehovah
is
indeed
spoken
of
in
samuel
vii
in
connection
with
vi
but
it
is
definitively
abandoned
in
consequence
of
jehovah
refusal
on
the
ground
that
it
is
not
man
part
to
build
a
house
for
god
but
god
to
build
a
house
for
man
in
strange
contrast
with
this
explanation
is
that
of
chronicles
that
david
is
a
man
of
war
and
has
shed
much
blood
and
therefore
dare
not
set
up
the
temple
that
he
had
waged
the
wars
of
jehovah
that
jehovah
had
given
victory
by
his
hand
would
in
the
older
warlike
time
have
seemed
no
reason
against
but
rather
an
argument
establishing
his
fitness
for
such
a
work
but
the
worst
discrepancy
is
that
between
the
solemn
installation
of
solomon
as
king
and
of
zadok
as
priest
with
all
the
forms
of
law
and
publicity
as
related
in
xxix
comp
xxiii
and
the
older
narrative
of
ii
according
to
the
latter
it
was
much
more
an
ordinary
palace
intrigue
by
means
of
which
one
party
at
court
succeeded
in
obtaining
from
the
old
king
enfeebled
with
age
his
sanction
for
solomon
succession
until
then
adonijah
had
been
regarded
as
to
the
throne
by
david
himself
by
all
israel
and
the
great
officers
of
the
kingdom
joab
and
abiathar
what
above
all
things
turned
the
scale
in
favour
of
solomon
was
the
weight
of
benaiah
six
hundred
praetorians
a
formidable
force
in
the
circumstances
of
the
period
the
author
of
chronicles
naively
supposes
he
has
successfully
evaded
all
difficulties
by
giving
out
the
coronation
of
solomon
related
by
himself
to
be
the
second
xxix
an
advertence
to
ii
which
does
not
remove
but
only
betrays
the
contradiction
yet
this
is
as
nothing
over
against
the
disharmony
of
the
total
impression
see
what
chronicles
has
made
out
of
david
the
founder
of
the
kingdom
has
become
the
founder
of
the
temple
and
the
public
worship
the
king
and
hero
at
the
head
of
his
companions
in
arms
has
become
the
singer
and
master
of
ceremonies
at
the
head
of
a
swarm
of
priests
and
levites
his
clearly
cut
figure
has
become
a
feeble
holy
picture
seen
through
a
cloud
of
incense
it
is
obviously
vain
to
try
to
combine
the
fundamentally
different
portraits
into
one
stereoscopic
image
it
is
only
the
tradition
of
the
older
source
that
possesses
historical
value
in
chronicles
this
is
clericalised
in
the
taste
of
the
time
which
had
no
feeling
longer
for
anything
but
cultus
and
torah
which
accordingly
treated
as
alien
the
old
history
which
nevertheless
was
bound
to
be
a
sacred
history
if
it
did
not
conform
with
its
ideas
and
metamorphose
itself
into
church
history
just
as
the
law
framed
by
ezra
as
the
foundation
of
judaism
was
regarded
as
having
been
the
work
of
moses
so
what
upon
this
basis
had
been
developed
after
moses
particularly
the
music
of
the
sanctuary
and
the
ordering
of
the
temple
carried
back
to
king
david
the
sweet
singer
of
israel
who
had
now
to
place
his
music
at
the
service
of
the
cultus
and
write
psalms
along
with
asaph
heman
and
jeduthun
the
levitical
singing
families
with
regard
to
solomon
chronicles
nowhere
departs
very
far
from
the
lines
of
the
book
of
kings
as
the
story
of
which
is
not
an
edifying
one
and
mercilessly
assails
that
of
required
to
be
omitted
the
narrative
accordingly
begins
with
with
solomon
accession
sacrifices
on
the
great
altar
at
gibeon
and
the
revelation
of
jehovah
which
was
thereupon
communicated
to
him
in
a
dream
this
last
is
transcribed
with
slight
alterations
but
at
the
outset
a
characteristic
divergence
is
found
solomon
loved
jehovah
walking
in
the
statutes
of
david
his
father
only
he
sacrificed
and
burnt
incense
on
the
high
places
because
there
was
no
house
built
unto
the
name
of
jehovah
until
those
days
and
the
king
went
to
gibeon
to
sacrifice
there
for
that
was
the
great
high
place
a
thousand
did
solomon
offer
upon
that
altar
and
jehovah
appeared
unto
him
in
a
dream
ask
what
i
shall
give
thee
so
iii
seq
chronicles
after
its
manner
first
surrounds
the
king
with
a
great
assemblage
of
captains
of
hundreds
and
thousands
of
judges
and
princes
and
heads
of
houses
and
purely
pentateuchal
dignities
and
then
proceeds
and
solomon
and
all
the
congregation
with
him
went
to
the
high
place
in
gibeon
for
there
was
god
tent
of
meeting
which
moses
the
servant
of
god
had
made
in
the
wilderness
but
the
ark
of
god
had
david
brought
up
from
where
he
had
prepared
for
it
for
he
had
pitched
a
tent
for
it
at
jerusalem
but
the
brazen
altar
that
bezaleel
the
son
of
uri
the
son
of
hur
had
made
stood
there
before
the
tabernacle
of
jehovah
and
solomon
and
the
congregation
sought
unto
it
and
solomon
offered
there
upon
the
brazen
altar
before
jehovah
by
the
tent
of
meeting
he
offered
a
thousand
and
god
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
saying
ask
what
i
shall
give
thee
i
in
the
older
narrative
there
is
nothing
about
the
tabernacle
it
being
assumed
that
no
apology
would
be
either
necessary
or
possible
for
solomon
having
sacrificed
on
a
high
place
chronicles
dominated
in
its
views
of
antiquity
by
the
priestly
code
has
missed
the
presence
of
the
tabernacle
and
supplied
the
want
in
accordance
with
that
norm
the
young
and
pious
king
could
not
possibly
have
made
his
solemn
inaugural
sacrifice
for
which
he
had
expressly
left
jerusalem
anywhere
else
than
at
the
legally
prescribed
place
and
still
less
could
jehovah
otherwise
have
bestowed
on
him
his
blessing
it
betokens
the
narrowness
and
at
the
same
time
the
boldness
of
the
author
that
he
retains
the
expression
used
in
iii
and
it
with
although
the
one
means
precisely
the
opposite
of
the
other
but
it
is
instructive
to
notice
how
on
other
occasions
he
is
hampered
by
his
mosaic
central
sanctuary
which
he
has
introduced
into
the
history
according
to
xvi
david
is
in
the
best
position
to
institute
also
a
sacrificial
service
beside
the
ark
of
jehovah
which
he
has
transferred
to
zion
but
he
dare
not
for
the
mosaic
altar
stands
at
gibeon
and
he
must
content
himself
with
a
musical
surrogate
vers
the
narrative
of
that
david
was
led
by
the
theophany
at
the
of
araunah
to
build
an
altar
there
and
present
upon
it
an
offering
that
was
accepted
by
heaven
is
at
its
close
maimed
and
spoiled
in
a
similar
way
by
the
remark
with
anticipatory
reference
to
that
the
mosaic
tabernacle
and
altar
of
burnt
offering
were
indeed
at
that
time
in
the
high
place
at
gibeon
but
that
the
king
had
not
the
strength
to
go
before
it
to
inquire
of
jehovah
being
so
smitten
with
fear
of
the
angel
with
the
drawn
sword
so
also
must
the
sacrifice
which
solomon
should
have
offered
on
his
return
from
gibeon
before
the
ark
at
jerusalem
be
similarly
ignored
i
because
it
uould
destroy
the
force
of
the
previous
explanation
of
the
high
place
at
gibeon
thus
the
shadow
takes
the
air
from
the
body
in
other
places
the
tabernacle
is
significantly
confounded
with
the
temple
of
jerusalem
graf
but
on
the
whole
it
remains
a
tolerably
inert
conception
only
made
use
of
in
the
passage
before
us
i
in
an
manner
in
order
to
clear
solomon
of
a
heavy
reproach
upon
the
last
solemn
act
of
worship
at
the
mosaic
sanctuary
immediately
follows
the
building
of
the
temple
i
iii
av
being
passed
over
a
few
little
touches
are
however
brought
in
to
show
the
wealth
of
solomon
i
they
do
not
occur
in
kings
until
chap
x
vers
and
are
also
repeated
in
chronicles
ix
seq
in
this
much
more
appropriate
connection
comp
lxx
strictly
speaking
indeed
david
has
taken
the
preparations
for
the
sacred
building
out
of
the
hands
of
his
successor
but
the
latter
appears
not
to
be
satisfied
with
these
ii
and
looks
after
them
once
more
i
ii
a
comparison
with
ezra
iii
preparation
of
the
second
temple
shows
that
the
story
is
an
elaboration
of
the
author
although
suggested
by
and
with
preservation
of
many
verbal
reminiscences
while
hiram
and
solomon
according
to
the
older
record
are
on
a
footing
of
equality
and
make
a
contract
based
on
reciprocity
of
service
the
tyrian
king
is
here
the
vassal
of
the
israelite
and
renders
to
him
what
he
requires
as
tribute
instead
of
as
there
explaining
himself
by
word
of
mouth
he
here
writes
a
letter
in
which
he
not
only
openly
avows
his
faith
in
jehovah
the
god
of
israel
the
maker
of
heaven
and
earth
but
also
betrays
an
extraordinary
acquaintance
with
the
pentateuchal
priestly
code
the
brassfounder
whom
solomon
brings
from

described
as
a
very
daedalus
and
prodigy
of
artistic
skill

exodus
xxxi
seq
his
being
made
the
son
of
a
woman
of
dan
and
not
of
a
widow

interpreters
with
the
materials
for
the
construction
of
a
little
family
romance
she
was
by
birth
a
woman
of
dan
married
into
the
tribe
of
napthali
lost
her
husband
and
as
widow
out
of
the
tribe
of
naphtali
became
the
wife
of
the
tyrian
so
bertheau
but
has
no
more
real
value
than
the
idea
that
sandalwood
is
obtained
from
lebanon
the
statement
of
xi
xii
that
israel
was
requisitioned
in
large
numbers
to
render
forced
service
to
the
king
has
substituted
for
it
by
the
chronicler
that
which
occurs
in
another
place

that
only
the
canaanite
serfs
were
employed
for
this
purpose
at
the
same
time
he
reckons
their
number
from
the
figures
supplied
in

lastly
the
manner
in
which
solomon
ii
assures
hiram
that
he
will
arrange
the
divine
service
in
the
new
house
in
a
thoroughly
correct
manner
according
to
the
ordinance
of
the
priestly
code
is
also
characteristic
similar
remarks
from
which
the
uninterrupted
practice
of
the
mosaic
cultus
according
to
the
rules
of
the
law
is
made
to
appear
are
afterwards
repeated
from

viii

in
chaps
iv
the
author
repeats
the
description
of
the
temple
in
with
the
omission
of
what
relates
to
profane
buildings
perhaps
in
one
passage
vii
he
found
the
now
very
corrupt
text
in
a
better
state
otherwise
he
has
excerpted
from
it
in
a
wretchedly
careless
style
or
word
for
word
transcribed
it
adding
merely
a
few
extravagances
or
appointments
of
later

the
specification

compare

to
deny
that
the
original
to
which
reference
must
in
many
places
be
made
in
order
that
the
meaning
may
be
understood
exists
in
requires
an
exercise
of
courage
which
might
be
much
better
employed
all
the
more
because
in
iv
the
summary
list
follows
the
description
of
details
precisely
as
in
vii
while
the
concrete
and
material
details
of
vii
are
reproduced
only
in
an
imperfect
and
cursory
manner
the
act
of
consecration
on
the
other
hand
and
the
discourse
delivered
by
solomon
on
the
occasion
is
accurately
and
fully
given
in
accordance
with
viii
such
additions
and
omissions
as
occur
are
all
deliberate
in
viii
the
priests
and
levites
on
an
occasion
which
so
closely
concerned
their
interests
do
not
play
any
adequate
part
and
in
particular
give
none
of
the
music
which
nevertheless
is
quite
indispensable
at
any
such
solemnity
accordingly
the
chronicler
at
the
word
priests
inserts
between
the
violently
separated
clauses
of
viii
the
following
for
all
the
priests
present
had
sanctified
themselves
without
distinction
of
classes
and
the
levites
the
singers
all
stood
in
white
linen
with
cymbals
and
psalteries
and
harps
at
the
east
end
of
the
altar
and
with
them
an
hundred
and
twenty
priests
sounding
with
trumpets
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
trumpeters
and
singers
were
as
one
to
make
one
sound
to
be
heard
in
praising
and
thanking
the
lord
and
when
the
music
began
with
trumpets
and
cymbals
and
instruments
and
the
song
of
praise
praise
ye
jehovah
for
he
is
good
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
then
the
house
was
filled
with
a
cloud
proceeding
the
narrative
of
viii
that
solomon
came
in
front
of
the
altar
and
there
prayed
is
indeed
in
the
first
instance
copied
vi
but
forthwith
authoritatively
interpreted
in
the
sense
that
the
king
did
not
really
and
actually
stand
before
the
altar
which
was
lawful
for
the
priests
alone
but
upon
an
improvised
pulpit
in
the
inner
court
upon
a
caldron
of
brass
vi
an
excellent
idea
which
has
met
with
the
due
commendation
of
expositors
the
close
of
solomon
prayer
viii
is
abridged
vi
perhaps
in
order
to
get
rid
of
viii
and
there
is
substituted
for
it
an
original
epilogue
vi
recalling
psalms
then
comes
a
larger
omission
that
of
viii
explained
by
the
difficulty
involved
in
the
king
here
kneeling
not
upon
the
caldron
but
before
the
altar
then
standing
up
and
blessing
like
a
priest
in
place
of
this
it
is
told
vii
how
the
altar
was
consecrated
by
fire
from
heaven
which
indeed
had
already

the
author
again
returns
to

tricks
it
out
wherever
it
appears
to
him
too
bare

trumpeting

singing
levites

finally
dismisses

over

motives

those
which
dictated

of

more
readily

retouched
in

all
dark
and
repulsive
features
are
removed
and
their
place
taken
by

and
brilliant
bits

taste

fire
from

the
fulfilment
of
all
righteousness
of

much

and
all
sorts
of
harmless
legendary
anachronisms
and
exaggerations
besides
the
material
of
tradition
seems
broken
up
in
an
extraneous
medium
the
spirit
of
judaism
after
solomon
death
the
history
of
israel
in
chronicles
is
traced
only
through
jehovah
kingdom
in
the
hand
of
the
sons
of
david
and
all
that
relates
to
the
ten
tribes
is
put
aside
for
according
to
the
notions
of
the
judaistic
period
israel
is
the
congregation
of
true
worship
and
this
last
is
connected
with
the
temple
at
jerusalem
in
which
of
course
the
samaritans
have
no
part
abijah
of
judah
makes
this
point
of
view
clear
to
jeroboam
and
his
army
in
a
speech
delivered
from
mount
zemaraim
before
the
battle
think
ye
to
withstand
the
kingdom
of
jehovah
in
the
hand
of
the
sons
of
david
because
ye
are
a
great
multitude
and
with
you
are
the
golden
calves
which
jeroboam
made
you
for
gods
have
ye
not
cast
out
the
priests
of
jehovah
the
sons
of
aaron
and
the
levites
and
made
for
yourselves
priests
after
the
manner
of
the
gentiles
so
that
whosoever
cometh
to
fill
his
hands
with
a
young
bullock
and
seven
rams
even
he
may
become
a
priest
for
the
false
gods
but
as
for
us
we
have
not
forsaken
jehovah
our
god
and
our
priests
minister
to
jehovah
the
sons
of
aaron
and
the
levites
in
the
service
and
they
burn
unto
jehovah
every
morning
and
every
evening
burnt
sacrifices
and
sweet
incense
the
shewbread
also
is
upon
the
pure
table
for
we
have
maintained
the
service
of
jehovah
our
god
but
ye
have
forsaken
him
and
behold
god
himself
is
with
us
at
our
head
and
his
priests
and
the
trumpets
to
cry
an
alarm
against
you
o
children
of
israel
fight
ye
not
against
jehovah
the
god
of
your
fathers
for
ye
shall
not
prosper

the
kingdom
which
bore
the
name
of
israel
was
actually
in
point
of
fact
in
the
olden
time
the
proper
israel
and
judah
was
merely
a
kind
of
appendage
to
it
when
amaziah
of
judah
after
the
conquest
of
the
edomites
challenged
to
battle
king
jehoash
of
samaria
whose
territory
had
at
that
time
suffered
to
the
utmost
under
the
continual
wars
with
the
syrians
the
latter
bid
say
to
him
the
thistle
that
was
in
lebanon
sent
to
the
cedar
that
was
in
lebanon
saying
give
thy
daughter
to
my
son
to
wife
then
passed
by
a
wild
beast
that
was
in
lebanon
and
trode
down
the
thistle
thou
hast
indeed
smitten
edom
and
thy
heart
hath
lifted
thee
up
enjoy
thy
glory
but
tarry
at
home
xiv
and
as
the
other
would
not
listen
he
punished
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
naughty
boy
and
then
let
him
go
religiously
the
relative
importance
of
the
two
corresponded
pretty
nearly
to
what
it
was
politically
and
historically
israel
was
the
cradle
of
prophecy
samuel
elijah
and
elisha
exercised
their
activity
there
what
contemporary
figure
from
judah
is
there
to
place
alongside
of
these
assuredly
the
author
of
the
book
of
kings
would
not
have
forgotten
them
had
any
such
there
been
for
he
is
a
judaean
with
all
his
heart
yet
is
compelled
purely
by
the
nature
of
the
case
to
interest
himself
chiefly
about
the
northern
kingdom
and
yet
again
at
the
very
close
it
was
the
impending
fall
of
samaria
that
called
into
life
a
new
phase
of
prophecy
he
who
inaugurated
it
the
judaean
amos
of
tekoah
was
sent
not
to
judah
but
to
israel
the
history
of
which
had
the
first
and
fullest
sympathy
of
his
inmost
soul
as
that
of
the
people
of
jehovah
isaiah
was
the
first
who
placed
jerusalem
in
the
centre
of
his
field
of
vision
and
turned
away
from
israel
for
at
the
time
of
his
first
public
appearance
war
was
raging
between
the
sister
nations
and
when
his
activity
was
at
its
acme
all
was
over
with
the
northern
kingdom
and
all
hope
had
to
cling
to
the
remnant
the
fallen
tabernacle
of
david
as
regards
the
cultus
certainly
matters
may
have
been
somewhat
less
satisfactory
in
israel
than
in
judah
at
least
in
the
last
century
before
the
assyrian
captivity
but
at
the
outset
there
was
no
essential
difference
on
all
hands
jehovah
was
worshipped
as
the
peculiar
divinity
of
the
nation
at
numerous
fanes
in
the
service
at
the
high
places
there
were
wanting
neither
in
the
one
nor
in
the
other
sacred
trees
posts
and
stones
images
of
silver
and
gold
isaiah
ii

xxxi
micah
it
is
a
question
whether
in
the
time
before
hezekiah
the
cultus
of
the
kingdom
at
jerusalem
had
so
much
to
distinguish
it
above
that
at
bethel
or
at
dan
against
jeroboam
golden
calves
must
be
set
the
brazen
serpent
of
moses
and
the
ark
of
jehovah
itself
which
in
ancient
times
was
an
idol
and
did
not
become
idealised
into
an
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
law
until
probably
it
had
actually
disappeared
as
for
the
prophetic
reaction
against
the
popular
cultus
the
instance
of
hosea
shows
that
it
came
into
activity
as
early
and
as
powerfully
in
israel
as
in
judah
even
after
josiah
reformation
jeremiah
complains
that
the
sister
who
hitherto
had
been
spared
is
in
no
respect
better
than
the
other
who
a
hundred
years
before
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
assyrians
iii
and
though
in
principle
the
author
of
the
book
of
kings
taking
his
stand
upon
deuteronomy
prefers
judah
and
jerusalem
yet
he
does
not
out
of
deference
to
this
judgment
alter
the
facts
which
show
that
old
israel
was
not
further
than
old
judah
from
compliance
with
the
deuteronomic
precepts
chronicles
on
the
other
hand
not
only
takes
the
law
the
penta
teu
chal
law
as
a
whole
but
more
particularly
the
priestly
code
therein
preponderating
as
its
rule
of
judgment
on
the
past
but
also
idealises
the
facts
in
accordance
with
that
norm
and
figures
to
itself
the
old
hebrew
people
as
in
exact
conformity
with
the
pattern
of
the
later
jewish
community
as
a
monarchically
graded
hierocracy
with
a
strictly
centralised
cultus
of
rigidly
prescribed
form
at
the
holy
place
of
jerusalem
when
accordingly
the
ten
tribes
fail
to
exhibit
all
the
marks
of
the
kingdom
of
god
this
is
taken
to
mean
their
falling
away
from
the
true
israel
they
have
made
goats
and
calves
their
gods
driven
away
the
priests
and
levites
and
in
a
word
broken
quite
away
from
the
institutions
which
shaped
themselves
in
judah
during
the
period
subsequent
to
josiah
and
received
their
from
ezra
the
chronicler
indeed
is
unable
even
in
the
case
of
these
schismatics
to
divest
himself
of
his
legal
notions
as
appears
almost
comically
in
the
circumstance
that
the
priests
of
jeroboam
set
about
their
heretical
practices
quite
in
accordance
with
the
prescriptions
of
the
priestly
code
and
procure
their
consecration
by
means
of
a
great
sacrifice
chron
xiii
like
other
heathen
therefore
they
are
taken
account
of
by
the
sacred
history
only
in
so
far
as
they
stood
in
relations
of
friendship
or
hostility
with
the
people
of
jehovah
properly
so
called
the
israel
in
the
land
of
judah
xxiii
and
in
all
references
to
them
the
most
sedulous
and
undisguised
partisanship
on
behalf
of
judah
is
manifested
even
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
northern
kingdom
itself
if
one
seriously
compare
xi
xv
xix
xx
xxv
xxviii
xxx
takes
the
pentateuch
as
mosaic
law
this
exclusion
of
the
ten
tribes
is
in
point
of
fact
an
inevitable
consequence
for
the
mere
fact
of
their
belonging
to
the
people
of
jehovah
destroys
the
fundamental
of
that
document
the
unity
and
legitimacy
of
the
worship
as
basis
of
the
theocracy
the
priests
and
levites
as
its
most
important
organs
the
sinews
and
muscles
of
the
body
politic
which
keep
the
organism
together
as
a
living
and
moving
whole
the
reverse
side
is
of
course
the
idealisation
of
judah
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
legitimate
worship
a
process
which
the
reader
can
imagine
from
the
specimens
already
given
with
reference
to
david
and
solomon
the
priests
and
levites
who
migrated
from
israel
are
represented
as
having
strengthened
the
southern
kingdom
xi
and
here
constitute
the
truly
dominant
element
in
the
history
it
is
for
their
sake
that
kings
exist
as
protectors
and
guardians
of
the
cultus
with
the
internal
arrangements
of
which
however
they
dare
not
intermeddle
xxvi
seq
to
deliver
discourses
and
ordain
spiritual
solemnities
which
figure
as
the
culminating
points
in
the
narrative
are
among
the
leading
duties
of
their
reign
xiii
xv
xx
xxix
xxx
xxxv
seq
those
among
them
who
are
good
apprehend
their
task
and
are
inseparable
from
the
holy
servants
of
jehovah
so
in
particular
jehoshaphat
hezekiah
and
josiah
of
the
first
mentioned
we
are
told
that
in
the
third
year
of
his
reign
he
appointed
a
royal
commission
of
notables
priests
and
levites
to
go
about
with
the
book
of
the
law
and
teach
in
the
cities
of
judah
xvii
in
the
larger
places
in
the
strongholds
he
further
instituted
colleges
of
justice
and
over
them
a
supreme
tribunal
at
jerusalem
also
consisting
of
priests
levites
and
notables
under
the
presidency
of
the
high
priest
for
spiritual
and
of
the
prince
of
the
house
of
judah
for
secular
affairs
xix
there
is
nothing
about
this
in
the
book
of
kings
although
what
is
of
less
importance
is
noticed
xxii
the
chronicler
makes
the
statement
in
his
own
language
which
is
unmistakable
especially
in
the
pious
speeches
probably
it
is
the
organisation
of
justice
as
existing
in
his
own
day
that
he
here
carries
back
to
jehoshaphat
so
that
here
most
likely
we
have
the
oldest
testimony
to
the
synedrium
of
jerusalem
as
a
court
of
highest
instance
over
the
provincial
synedria
as
also
to
its
composition
and
presidency
the
impossibility
of
such
a
judiciary
system
in
antiquity
is
clear
from
its
presupposing
the
book
of
the
law
as
its
basis
from
its
of
priests
and
levites
and
also
from
its
actual
inconsistency
with
incidental
notices
particularly
in
isaiah
and
the
older
prophets
down
to
jeremiah
xxvi
in
which
it
everywhere
is
taken
for
granted
as
a
thing
of
course
that
the
rulers
are
also
at
the
same
time
the
natural
judges
moreover
chronicles
already
tells
us
about
david
something
similar
to
what
it
says
about
jehoshaphat
xxiii
xxvi
the
reason
why
the
latter
is
selected
by
preference
for
this
work
lies
simply
in
his
name
jehovah
is
judge
as
he
himself
is
made
to
indicate
in
various
ways
xix
compare
joel
iv
but
the
king
of
judah
is
strengthened
by
the
priests
and
levites
not
only
in
these
domestic
affairs
but
also
for
war
as
the
trumpets
of
the
priests
give
to
abijah
courage
and
the
victory
against
jeroboam
of
israel
so
do
the
levites
also
to
jehoshaphat
against
moab
and
ammon
having
fasted
and
received
while
praying
the
comfortable
assurance
of
the
singer
jahaziel
see
god
he
advances
next
morning
with
his
army
against
the
enemy
having
in
the
van
the
levites
who
march
in
sacred
attire
in
front
of
the
armed
men
and
sing
praise
ye
the
lord
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
he
then
finds
that
the
fighting
has
already
been
done
by
the
enemy
themselves
who
at
the
sound
of
that
song
of
praise
have
fallen
upon
and
annihilated
one
another
three
days
are
spent
in
dividing
the
spoil
and
then
he
returns
as
he
came
the
levitical
music
leading
the
van
with
psalteries
and
harps
and
trumpets
to
the
house
of
jehovah
xx
hezekiah
is
glorified
in
a
similar
manner

according

celebrate
the

most
sumptuous
manner

finally
from

the
seventh

to
concern
himself
about
the
accurate
rendering
of
their
dues
to
the
clergy
all
is
described
in
the
accustomed
style
in
the
course
of
three
long
chapters
which
tell
us
nothing
indeed
about
the
time
of
hezekiah
but
are
full
of
information
for
the
period
in
which
the
writer
lived
particularly
with
reference
to
the
method
then
followed
in
offering
the
sacred
dues
xxix
in
the
case
of
josiah
also
the
account
of
his
reformation
of
the
worship
is
on
the
whole
reproduced
in
chronicles
only
in
a
mutilated
manner
but
the
short
notice
of
xxiii
is
amplified
into
a
very
minute
description
of
a
splendid
passover
feast
in
which
as
always
the
priests
and
above
all
the
levites
figure
as
the
leading
personalities
in
this
last
connection
one
little
trait
worth
noticing
remains
namely
that
the
great
assembly
in
which
the
king
causes
the
book
of
the
law
to
be
sworn
to
is
in
every
other
respect
made
up
in
xxxiv
seq
exactly
as
it
is
in
xxiii
except
that
instead
of
the
priests
and
we
find
the
priests
and
the
significance
of
this
is
best
seen
from
the
targum
where
the
priests
and
prophets
are
translated
into
the
priests
and
scribes
by
this
projection
of
the
legitimate
cultus
prescribed
in
the
law
and
realised
in
judaism
the
chronicler
is
brought
however
into
a
peculiar
conflict
with
the
statements
of
his
authority
which
show
that
the
said
cultus
was
not
a
mature
thing
which
preceded
all
history
but
came
gradually
into
being
in
the
course
of
history
he
makes
his
escape
as
well
as
he
can
but
yet
not
without
a
strange
vacillation
between
the
timeless
manner
of
looking
at
things
which
is
natural
to
him
and
the
historical
tradition
which
he
uses
and
appropriates
the
verses
in
xiv
judah
not
rehoboam
merely
did
that
which
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
jehovah
and
provoked
him
to
jealousy
by
their
sins
which
they
sinned
above
all
that
their
fathers
had
done
and
they
set
up
for
themselves
high
places
macceboth
and
asherim
which
in
the
passage
where
they
occur
are
like
the
parallel
statement
regarding
israel
xii
seq
of
primary
importance
and
cancel
by
one
bold
stroke
the
alleged
difference
of
worship
between
the
levitical
and
kingdom
are
omitted
as
quite
too
impossible
although
the
whole
remaining
context
is
preserved
xii
in
the
same
way
the
unfavourable
judgment
upon
rehoboam
successor
abijah
xv
is
dropped
because
the
first
kings
of
judah
inasmuch
as
they
maintain
the
true
religion
against
those
of
israel
who
have
fallen
away
from
it
must
of
necessity
have
been
good
but
though
the
chronicler
is
silent
about
what
is
bad
for
the
sake
of
judah
honour
he
can
not
venture
to
pass
over
the
improvement
which
according
to
xv
was
introduced
in
day
although
one
does
not
in
the
least
know
what
need
there
was
for
it
everything
already
having
been
in
the
best
possible
state
nay
he
even
exaggerates
this
improvement
and
makes
of
asa
another
josiah
xv
represents
him
also
xiv
as
abolishing
the
high
places
and
yet
after
all
xv
repeats
the
statement
of
xv
that
the
high
places
were
not
removed
so
also
of
jehoshaphat
we
are
told
in
the
first
place
that
he
walked
in
the
first
ways
of
his
father
asa
and
abolished
the
high
places
in
judah
xvii
xix
a
false
generalisation
from
xxii
and
then
afterwards
we
learn
xx
that
the
high
places
still
remained
word
for
word
according
to
xxii
to
thc
author
it
seems
on
the
one
hand
an
impossibility
that
the
worship
of
the
high
places
which
in
spite
of
is
to
him
fundamentally
idolatry
should
not
have
been
repressed
even
by
pious
kings
and
yet
on
the
other
hand
he
mechanically
transcribes
his
copy
in
the
case
of
the
notoriously
wicked
rulers
his
resort
is
to
make
them
simply
heathen
and
persecutors
of
the
covenant
religion
for
to
him
they
are
inconceivable
within
the
limits
of
jehovism
which
always
in
his
view
has
had
the
law
for
its
norm
and
is
one
and
the
same
with
the
exclusive
mosaism
cf
judaism
so
first
in
the
case
of
joram
he
makes
high
places
on
the
hills
of
judah
and
seduces
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
to
commit
fornication
and
judah
to
apostatise
xxi
and
moreover
slays
all
his
brethren
with
the
sword
ver
the
one
follows
from
the
other
his
widow
athaliah
breaks
up
the
house
of
jehovah
by
the
hand
of
her
sons
who
had
been
murdered
but
for
this
purpose
are
revived
and
makes
images
of
baal
out
of
the
dedicated
things
xxiv
none
the
less
on
that
account
does
the
public
worship
of
jehovah
go
on
uninterrupted
under
jehoiada
the
priest
most
unsparing
is
the
treatment
that
ahaz
receives
according
to
xvi
be
saw
at
damascus
an
altar
which
took
his
fancy
and
he
caused
a
similar
one
to
be
set
up
at
jerusalem
after
its
pattern
while
solomon
brazen
altar
was
probably
sent
to
the
it
was
urijah
the
priest
who
carried
out
the
orders
of
the
king
one
observes
no
sign
of
autonomy
or
of
the
inviolable
divine
right
of
the
sanctuary
the
king
commands
and
the
priest
obeys
to
the
chronicler
the
story
so
told
is
quite
incomprehensible
what
does
he
make
of
it
ahaz
introduced
the
idolatrous
worship
of
damascus
abolished
the
worship
of
jehovah
and
shut
up
the
temple
xxviii
he
regards
not
the
person
of
a
man
the
inflexible
unity
of
the
mosaic
cultus
is
everything
to
the
chronicler
and
its
historical
identity
would
be
destroyed
if
an
orthodox
priest
a
friend
of
the
prophet
isaiah
had
lent
a
helping
hand
to
set
up
a
foreign
altar
to
make
idolaters
pure
and
simple
of
manasseh
and
amon
any
heightening
of
what
is
said
in
xxi
was
hardly
necessary
and
besides
there
were
here
special
reasons
against
drawing
the
picture
in
too
dark
colours
it
is
wonderful
also
to
see
how
the
people
which
is
always
animated
with
alacrity
and
zeal
for
the
law
and
rewards
its
pious
rulers
for
their
fidelity
to
the
covenant
xv
xvii
xxiv

its
censure
of
these
wicked
kings
by
withholding
from
them
or
impairing
the
honour
of
royal
burial
xxi
xxviii

in
spite
of

the
periodically
recurring
invasions
of
heathenism
help
at
the
same
time
to
an
understanding
of
the
consequent
reforms
which
otherwise
surpass
the
comprehension
of
the
jewish
scribe
according
to
the
books
of
kings
joash
hezekiah
and
josiah
hit
upon
praiseworthy
innovations
in
the
temple
cultus
set
aside
deeply
rooted
and
immemorial
customs
and
reformed
the
public
worship
of
jehovah
these
advances
within
jehovism
which
of
course
are
quite
incompatible
with
its
mosaic
fixity
are
made
by
the
chronicler
to
be
simple
restorations
of
the
pure
religion
following
upon
its
temporary
violent
suspension
it
is
in
case
that
this
is
done
in
the
most
thoroughgoing
manner
after
his
predecessor
has
shut
the
doors
of
the
house
of
jehovah
put
out
the
lights
and
brought
the
service
to
an
end
he
sets
all
in
operation
again
by
means
of
the
resuscitated
priests
and
levites
the
first
and
most
important
act
of
his
reign
is
the
consecration
of
the
temple
xxix
with
which
is
connected
xxx
the
restoration
of
the
passover
and
the
restitution
of
the
temporalia
to
the
clergy
who
as
it
seems
have
hitherto
been
deprived
of
them
that
xviii
although
very
different
has
supplied
the
basis
for
all
these
extravagances
is
seen
by
comparing

only
that
the
king
destroyed
the
brazen
serpent
nehushtan

is
passed
over
in
silence
as
if
it
were
incredible
that
such
an
image
should
have
been
worshipped
down
to
that
date
in
the
belief
that
it
had
come
down
from
the
time
of
moses
the
not
less
offensive
statement
on
the
other
hand
that
he
took
away
by
which
only
that
of
the

can
be
understood
comp
deuteronomy

got
over

charging
the

which
occurred
here

there
throughout

of
course
at
heathen
altars
in
the
cases
of
joash

the
free
flight
of
the
chronicler
fancy
is
hampered
by
the
copy
to
which
he
is
tied
and
which
gives
not
the
results
merely
but
the
details
of
the
proceedings
themselves
xxiii
it
is
precisely
such
histories
as
these
almost
the
only
circumstantially
told
ones
relating
to
judah
in
the
book
of
kings
which
though
in
their
nature
most
akin
to
our
author
preference
for
cultus
bring
him
into
the
greatest
embarrassment
by
introducing
details
which
to
his
notions
are
wholly
against
the
law
and
yet
must
not
be
represented
otherwise
than
in
the
most
favourable
light
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
sections
about
joash
in
xi
having
their
scene

subject
laid
in

are
at

identical
with

recur
verbatim
in

if
trifling
alterations
be

in

occur
passages

are
taken
over

without

here
they
are
inappropriate

in

altered

the

show
to
understand

must
bear
in

that

former
occasion
that
of
solomon
possibly
have
been
accomplished
by
the
agency
of
the
bodyguard
of
the
kings
of

is
it
possible
that
the
high
priest
should
have
made
a
covenant
with
the
captains
within
the
house
of
jehovah
and
himself
have
held
out
the
inducement
to
those
mercenaries
to
penetrate
into
the
temple
precincts
that
were
indeed
an
outrage
upon
the
law
not
lightly
to
be
imputed
to
so
holy
a
man
why
then
did
not
jehoiada
make
use
of
his
own
guard
the
myriads
of
levites
who
were
at
his
command
such
a
course
was
the
only
right
one
and
therefore
that
which
was
followed
no
one
shall
come
into
the
house
of
jehovah
save
the
priests
and
they
of
the
levites
that
minister
in
accordance
with
this
fundamental
principle
stated
by
himself
xxiii
comp
ver
into
the
house
instead
of
within
the
ranks
our
pious
historian
substitutes
his
priests
and
levites
for
the
carians
and
runners
hereby
also
jehoiada
comes
into
the
place
that
belongs
to
him
as
sovereign
of
the
sanctuary
and
of
the
congregation
he
therefore
needs
no
longer
to
set
on
foot
in
secret
a
conspiracy
with
the
chiefs
of
the
but
through
his
own
spiritual
officers
calls
together
the
levites
and
heads
of
houses
from
all
the
cities
of
judah
into
the
temple
and
causes
the
whole
assemblage
there
to
enter
into
a
covenant
with
the
young
king
the
glaring
inconsistencies
inevitably
produced
by
the
new
colouring
thus
given
to
individual
parts
of
the
old
picture
must
simply
be
taken
as
part
of
the
bargain
if
jehoiada
has
unrestricted
sway
over
such
a
force
and
sets
about
his
revolution
with
the
utmost
publicity
then
it
is
he
and
not
athaliah
who
has
the
substance
of
power
why
then
all
this
trouble
about
the
deposition
of
the
tyrant
out
of
mere
delight
in
levitical
pomp
and
high
solemnities
what
moreover
is
to
be
done
with
the
captains
who
are
retained
in
xxiii
and
in
ver
are
even
called
officers
of
the
host
as
in
xi
after
their
soldiers
have
been
taken
from
them
or
metamorphosed
had
the
levites
a
military
organisation
and
divided
into
three
companies
did
they
change
places
every
week
in
the
temple
service
the
commentators
are
inclined
to
call
in
to
their
aid
such
inventive
assumptions
with
which
however
they
may
go
on
for
ever
without
attaining
their
end
for
the
error
multiplies
itself
as
a
specially
striking
instance
of
the
manner
in
which
the
procedure
of
chronicles
avenges
itself
may
be
mentioned
chapter
xxiii
and
they
took
each
his
men
the
words
are
taken
from
xi
but
there
refer
to
the
captains
while
here
the
antecedents
are
the
levites
and
all
the
men
of
judah
as
if
each
one
of
these
last
had
a
company
of
his
own
which
entered
upon
service
or
left
it
every
sabbath
day
the
comparison
of
xxiv
with
xii
is
not
much
less
instructive
according
to
xii
joash
enjoined
that
all
the
money
dues
payable
to
the
temple
should
in
future
fall
to
the
priests
who
in
turn
were
to
be
under
obligation
to
maintain
the
building
in
good
repair
but
they
took
the
money
and
neglected
the
other
side
of
the
bargain
and
when
they
and
jehoiada
in
particular
were
blamed
by
the
king
on
that
account
they
gave
up
the
dues
so
as
not
to
be
liable
to
the
burden
thereupon
the
king
set
up
a
kind
of
sacred
treasury
a
chest
with
a
hole
in
the
lid
near
the
altar
on
the
right
hand
as
one
goes
into
the
temple
into
which
the
priests
were
to
cast
the
money
which
came
in
with
the
exception
of
the
sin
and
trespass
moneys
which
still
belonged
to
them
and
as
often
as
the
chest
became
full
the
king
scribes
and
the
chief
priest
removed
the
money
weighed
it
and
handed
it
over
to
the
contractors
for
payment
of
the
workmen
that
none
of
it
was
to
be
employed
for
sacred
vessels
is
expressly
said
ver
this
arrangement
by
king
joash
was
a
lasting
one
and
still
subsisted
in
josiah
time
xxii
the
arbitrary
proceeding
of
joash
did
not
well
suit
the
ideas
of
an
autonomous
hierocracy
according
to
the
law
the
current
money
dues
fell
to
the
priests
no
king
had
the
right
to
take
them
away
and
dispose
of
them
at
his
pleasure
how
was
it
possible
that
jehoiada
should
waive
his
divine
right
and
suffer
such
a
sacrilegious
invasion
of
sacred
privileges
how
was
it
possible
that
he
should
be
blamed
for
his
at
first
passive
resistance
of
the
illegal
invasion
how
was
it
possible
at
all
that
the
priest
in
his
own
proper
department
should
be
called
to
account
by
the
king
chronicles
knows
better
than
that
the
wicked
athaliah
had
wasted
and
plundered
the
temple
joash
determined
to
restore
it
and
for
this
purpose
to
cause
money
to
be
collected
throughout
all
israel
by
the
agency
of
the
levites
but
as
these
last
were
in
no
hurry
he
made
a
chest
and
set
it
outside
in
the
doorway
of
the
sanctuary
there
the
people
streamed
past
and
gentle
and
simple
with
joyful
heart
cast
in
their
gifts
until
the
chest
was
full
this
being
announced
by
the
keepers
of
the
door
the
king
scribe
and
the
delegate
of
the
high
priest
came
to
remove
the
money
with
it
the
king
and
the
high
priest
paid
the
workmen
and
what
remained
over
was
made
into
costly
vessels
xxiv
according
to
this
account
joash
makes
no
arrangement
whatever
about
the
sacred
dues
but
sets
on
foot
an
extraordinary
collection
as
had
once
been
done
by
moses
for
the
building
of
the
tabernacle
xxiv
following
upon
this
everything
else
also
which
in
xii
is
a
permanent
arrangement
here
figures
as
an
isolated
occurrence
instead
of
necessary
repairs
of
the
temple
constantly
recurring
only
one
extraordinary
restoration
of
it
is
mentioned
and
for
this
occasional
purpose
only
is
the
treasure
chest
set
up
not
however
beside
the
altar
but
only
at
the
doorway
xxiv
comp
xii
the
clergy
the
levites
are
charged
only
with
making
the
collection
not
with
maintaining
the
building
out
of
the
sacred
revenues
consequently
they
are
not
reproached
with
keeping
the
money
to
themselves
but
only
with
not
being
heartily
enough
disposed
towards
the
collection
it
appears
however
that
they
were
perfectly
justified
in
this
backwardness
for
the
king
has
only
to
set
up
the
treasury
of
god
when
forthwith
it
overflows
with
the
voluntary
offerings
of
the
people
who
flock
to
it
so
that
out
of
the
proceeds
something
remains
over
ver
for
certain
other
purposes
which
according
to
xii
were
expressly
excluded
joash
imposes
no
demands
at
all
upon
the
priests
and
jehoiada
in
particular
stands
over
against
him
as
invested
with
perfectly
equal
rights
if
the
king
sends
his
scribe
the
high
priest
also
does
not
appear
personally
but
causes
himself
to
be
represented
by
a
delegate
xxiv
comp
xii
here
also
many
a
new
piece
does
not
come
well
into
the
old
garment
as
de
wette
i
shows
chronicles
itself
tacitly
gives
the
honour
to
the
older
narrative
by
making
joash
at
last
apostatise
from
mosaism
and
refuse
the
grateful
deference
which
he
owed
to
the
high
priest
this
is
the
consequence
of
the
unpleasant
impression
derived
not
from
its
own
story
but
from
that
of
the
book
of
kings
with
regard
to
the
undue
interference
of
the
otherwise
pious
king
in
the
affairs
of
the
sanctuary
and
of
the
priests
chronicles
reaps
the
fruits
of
its
perversion
of
xii
in
its
reproduction
of
the
nearly
related
and
closely
connected
section

it
is
worth
while
once
more
to
bring
the
passages
together

they
deal
faithfully

the
houses
which
the
kings
of
judah
had
destroyed
and
the
men
did
the
work
faithfully

the
overseers
of
them
were
jahath

obadiah
the
levites
of
the
sons
of
merari

zechariah
and
meshullam
of
the
kohathites

all
the
levites
that
had
skill
in

were
over
the
bearers
of
burdens
and
overseers
of
all
that
wrought
the
work
in
any
manner
of
service
and
others
of
the
levites
were

brought

shaphan
carried
the

brought
the

besides
brought

again
and
said
thy

saying
servants
have
emptied
out

all
that
was
committed
to
thy

that
was

they

delivered
it

saying
hilkiah

hath
delivered

shaphan
the

to
me
a
book

told
the
king
saying
hilkiah
read
it
before
the
king
the
priest
hath
given
me
a
book
and
shaphan
read
out
of
it
before
the
king
the
occasion
on
which
the
priest
introduces
the
book
of
the
law
to
the
notice
of
shaphan
has
presuppositions
in
the
arrangement
made
by
joash
which
chronicles
has
destroyed
substituting
others
in
its
place
that
the
temple
had
been
destroyed
under
the
predecessors
of
josiah
but
that
under
the
latter
money
was
raised
by
the
agency
of
peripatetic
levites
throughout
all
israel
for
the
restoration
and
in
the
first
instance
deposited
in
the
at
the
emptying
of
this
chest
the
priest
is
then
alleged
to
have
found
the
book
ver
after
deuteronomy
xxxi
notwithstanding
that
on
this
occasion
shaphan
also
and
the
two
accountants
added
in
ver
were
present
and
ought
therefore
to
have
had
a
share
in
the
discovery
which
however
is
excluded
by
ver
xxii
there
are
other
misunderstandings
besides
in
particular
the
superintendents
of
the
works
to
whom
according
to
the
original
narrative
the
money
is
handed
over
for
payment
are
degraded
to
the
rank
of
simple
workmen
from
whom
nevertheless
they
are
again
afterwards
distinguished
and
while
in
xxii
they
are
represented
as
dealing
faithfully
paying
out
the
in
xxxiv
they
deal
faithfully
in
their
work
perhaps
however
this
is
no
mere
misunderstanding
but
is
connected
with
the
endeavour
to
keep
profane
hands
as
far
off
as
possible
from
that
which
is
holy
and
in
particular
to
give
the
management
of
the
work
to
the
levites
vers
to
what
length
the
anxiety
of
later
ages
went
in
this
matter
is
seen
in
the
statement
of
josephus
xv
that
herod
caused
one
thousand
priests
to
be
trained
as
masons
and
carpenters
for
the
building
of
his
temple
the
two
most
interesting
alterations
in
chronicles
are
easily
overlooked
in
ver
the
words
he
read
the
book
to
the
king
are
changed
into
he
read
out
of
the
book
to
the
king
and
after
hilkiah
gave
the
book
to
shaphan
ver
the
words
and
he
read
it
are
omitted
in
the
book
appears
as
of
very
moderate
size
but
the
author
of
chronicles
figures
to
himself
the
whole
pentateuch
under
that
name
in
the
sequel
xxii
is
indeed
repeated
verbatim
in
xxxiv
but
the
incomparably
more
important
section
connected
with
it
xxiii
giving
a
detailed
account
of
josiah
vigorous
reformation
is
omitted
and
its
place
taken
by
the
meagre
remark
that
the
king
removed
all
abominations
out
of
israel
xxxiv
in
compensation
his
passover
feast
is
described
all
the
more
fully
chap
in
recording
also
the
finding
and
publication
of
the
law
chronicles
fails
to
realise
that
this
document
begins
now
for
the
first
time
to
be
historically
operative
and
acquires
its
great
importance
quite
suddenly
on
the
contrary
it
had
been
from
the
days
of
moses
the
basis
on
which
the
community
rested
and
had
been
in
force
and
validity
at
all
normal
times
only
temporarily
could
this
of
the
theocracy
be
repressed
by
wicked
kings
forthwith
to
become
vigorous
and
active
again
as
soon
as
the
pressure
was
removed
as
soon
as
ahaz
has
closed
his
eyes
hezekiah
in
the
first
month
of
his
first
year
again
restores
the
mosaic
cultus
and
as
soon
as
josiah
reaches
years
of
discretion
he
makes
good
the
sins
of
his
fathers
being
at
his
accession
still
too
young
the
eighth
year
of
his
reign
is
as
a
tribute
to
propriety
selected
instead
of
the
eighth
year
of
his
life
and
the
great
reformation
assigned
to
that
period
which
in
point
of
fact
he
undertook
at
a
much
later
date
xxxiv
xxiii
thus
the
movement
happily
becomes
separated
from
its
historical
occasion
and
in
character
the
innovation
appears
rather
as
a
simple
recovery
of
the
spring
after
the
pressure
on
it
has
been
removed
the
mist
disappears
before
the
sun
of
the
law
which
appears
in
its
old
strength
its
light
passes
through
no
phases
but
shines
from
the
beginning
with
uniform
brightness
what
josiah
did
had
also
been
done
before
him
already
by
asa
then
by
jehoshaphat
then
by
hezekiah
the
reforms
are
not
steps
in
a
progressive
development
but
have
all
the
same
unchanging
contents
such
is
the
influence
upon
historical
vision
of
that
transcendental
mosaism
raised
far
above
all
growth
and
process
of
becoming
which
can
be
traced
even
in
the
book
of
kings
but
is
so
much
more
palpable
in
the
book
of
chronicles
apart
from
the
fact
that
it
represents
the
abiding
tradition
of
the
legitimate
cultus
at
jerusalem
the
history
of
judah
in
the
book
of
chronicles
has
yet
another
instructive
purpose
in
the
kingdom
of
judah
it
is
not
a
natural
and
human
but
a
divine
pragmatism
that
is
operative
to
give
expression
to
this
is
what
the
prophets
exist
for
in
unbroken
succession
side
by
side
with
high
priests
and
kings
they
connect
the
deeds
of
men
with
the
events
of
the
course
of
the
world
and
utilise
the
sacred
history
as
a
theme
for
their
preaching
as
a
collection
of
examples
illustrative
of
the
promptest
operation
of
the
righteousness
of
jehovah
in
doing
so
they
do
not
preach
what
is
new
or
free
but
have
at
their
command
like
jehovah
himself
only
the
law
of
moses
setting
before
their
hearers
prosperity
and
adversity
in
conformity
with
the
stencil
pattern
just
as
the
law
is
faithfully
fulfilled
or
neglected
of
course
their
prophecies
always
come
exactly
true
and
in
this
way
is
seen
an
astonishing
harmony
between
inward
worth
and
outward
circumstance
never
does
sin
miss
its
punishment
and
never
where
misfortune
occurs
is
guilt
wanting
in
the
fifth
year
of
rehoboam
judah
and
jerusalem
were
ravaged
by
pharaoh
shishak
xiv
the
explanation
is
that
three
years
they
walked
in
the
ways
of
david
and
solomon
because
for
three
years
they
were
strengthened
and
reinforced
by
the
priests
and
levites
and
other
pious
persons
who
had
immigrated
from
the
northern
kingdom
xi
but
thereafter
in
the
fourth
year
after
the
kingdom
of
rehoboam
had
been
strengthened
and
confirmed
he
forsook
the
law
and
all
israel
with
him
xii
and
in
the
fifth
year
followed
the
invasion
of
shishak
a
prophet
announces
this
and
in
consequence
the
king
humbles
himself
along
with
his
people
and
escapes
with
comparatively
trifling
punishment
being
thought
worthy
to
reign
yet
other
twelve
years
asa
in
his
old
age
was
diseased
in
his
feet
xv
according
to
xvi
he
died
of
this
illness
which
is
described
as
extremely
dangerous
in
the
year
of
his
reign
after
having
already
been
otherwise
unfortunate
in
his
later
years
and
why
he
had
invoked
foreign
aid
instead
of
the
divine
against
baasha
of
israel
now
as
baasha
survived
only
to
the
year
of
asa
the
wickedness
must
have
been
perpetrated
before
that
date
but
in
that
case
its
connection
with
the
punishment
which
overtook
the
king
only
towards
the
close
of
his
life
would
not
be
clear
baasha
expedition
against
jerusalem
accordingly
and
the
syrian
invasion
of
israel
occasioned
by
asa
on
that
account
are
brought
down
in
chronicles
to
the
year
of
the
latter
xvi
it
has
been
properly
observed
that
baasha
was
at
that
date
long
dead
and
the
proposal
has
accordingly
been
made
to
change
the
number
into
sixteen
without
considering
that
the
first
half
of
the
reign
of
asa
is
expressly
characterised
as
having
been
prosperous
that
the
year
is
already
reached
in
chap
xv
and
that
the
correction
destroys
the
connection
of
the
passage
with
what
follows
xvi
for
it
is
in
connection
with
that
flagitious
appeal
for
aid
to
the
syrians
that
the
usual
prophet
makes
his
appearance
xvi
and
makes
the
usual
announcement
of
impending
punishment
it
is
hanani
a
man
of
northern
israel
xvi
but
asa
treats
him
as
if
he
were
one
of
his
own
subjects
handles
him
severely

shuts
him
in

by
this
he
hastens
and
increases
his
punishment
under
which
he
falls
in
the
year
of
his
reign
jehoshaphat
the
pious
king
according
to
took
part
in
the
expedition
of
the
godless
ahab
of
israel
against
the
damascenes
chronicles
can
not
allow
this
to
pass
unrebuked
and
accordingly
when
the
king
returns
in
peace
the
same
hanani
announces
his
punishment
albeit
a
gracious
one
xix
and
gracious
indeed
it
is
the
moabites
and
ammonites
invade
the
land
but
jehoshaphat
without
any
effort
on
his
part
wins
a
glorious
victory
and
inexhaustible
plunder
xx
one
can
not
blame
him
therefore
for
once
more
entering
into
an
alliance
with
ahab
successor
for
a
naval
expedition
to
be
undertaken
in
common
which
is
to
sail
from
a
port
of
the
red
sea
probably
round
africa
to
tarshish
spain
ix
but
this
time
he
is
punished
more
seriously
as
eliezer
the
son
of
dodavah
had
prophesied
the
ships
are
wrecked
compare
on
the
other
hand
xxii
jehoshaphat
made
ships
of
tarshish
to
go
to
ophir
for
gold
but
they
went
not
for
the
ships
were
wrecked
in
the
harbour
on
the
red
sea
at
that
time
ahaziah
the
son
of
ahab
had
said
to
jehoshaphat
let
my
servants
go
with
thy
servants
in
the
ships
but
jehoshaphat
would
not
so
the
original
statement
but
in
chronicles
a
moral
ground
must
be
found
for
the
misfortune
and
jehoshaphat
therefore
makes
with
the
king
of
samaria
a
sinful
alliance
which
in
point
of
fact
he
had
declined
not
indeed
from
religious
motives
joram
the
son
of
jehoshaphat
conducted
himself
very
ill
it
is
said
in
viii
chronicles
enhances
his
offence
and
above
all
adds
the
merited
reward
xxi

he

quitted

before
iii

write
to
the
offender
a
letter
the
threats
of
which
are
duly
put
into
execution
by
jehovah
the
philistines
and
arabians
having
previously
pressed
him
hard
he
falls
into
an
incurable
sickness
of
the
bowels
which
afflicts
him
for
years
and
finally
brings
him
to
his
end
in
a
most
frightful
manner
xxi
in
concurrence
with
the
judgment
of
god
the
people
withhold
from
the
dead
king
the
honours
of
royalty
and
he
is
not
buried
beside
his
fathers
notwithstanding

joash
according

with
misfortune
he
was

buy
off
hazael

laid
siege
to
jerusalem
at
a
heavy
price
and
finally
he
died
by
the
assassin

chronicles
is
able
to
tell
how
he
deserved
this
fate
in
the
sentence
he
did
what
was
right
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
all
his
days
because
jehoiada
the
high
priest
had
instructed
him
xii
it
alters
the
last
expression
into
all
the
days
of
jehoiada
the
priest
xxiv
after
the
death
of
his
benefactor
he
fell
away
and
showed
his
family
the
basest
ingratitude
at
the
end
of
that
very
year
the
syrians
invade
him
after
their
departure
his
misfortunes
are
increased
by
a
dreadful
illness
under
which
he
is
murdered
xxiv
amaziah
was
defeated
made
prisoner
and
severely
punished
by
jehoash
king
of
samaria
whom
he
had
audaciously
challenged
xiv
why
because
he
had
set
up
in
jerusalem
idols
which
had
been
carried
off
from
edom
and
served
them
xxv
he
prefers
the
plundered
gods
of
a
vanquished
people
to
jehovah
at
the
very
moment
when
the
latter
has
proved
victorious
over
them
from
the
time
of
this
apostasy
a
crime
for
which
no
punishment
could
be
too
great
his
own
servants
are
also
stated
to
have
conspired
against
him
and
put
him
to
death
xxv
and
yet
we
are
assured
in
ver
after
xiv
i
that
amaziah
survived
his
adversary
by
fifteen
years
uzziah
one
of
the
best
kings
of
judah
became
a
leper
and
was
compelled
to
hand
over
the
regency
to
his
son
jotham
xv
for
adds
chronicles
when
he
had
become
strong
his
heart
was
lifted
up
even
to
ruin
so
that
he
transgressed
against
jehovah
his
god
and
went
into
the
temple
of
jehovah
to
burn
incense
upon
the
altar
of
incense
and
azariah
the
priest
went
in
after
him
and
with
him
fourscore
priests
of
jehovah
and
withstood
him
and
said
it
is
not
for
thee
to
burn
incense
but
only
for
the
sons
of
aaron
who
are
consecrated
thereto
then
uzziah
was
wroth
and
laid
not
the
censer
aside
and
the
leprosy
rose
up
in
his
forehead
and
the
priests
thrust
him
out
from
thence
xxvi
the
matter
is
now
no
longer
a
mystery
ahaz
was
a
king
of
little
worth
and
yet
he
got
fairly
well
out
of
the
difficulty
into
which
the
invasion
of
the
allied
syrians
and
israelites
had
brought
him
by
making
his
kingdom
tributary
to
the
assyrian
xvi
but
chronicles
could
not
possibly
let
him
off
so
cheaply
by
it
he
is
delivered
into
the
hand
of
the
enemy
the
israelites
alone
slaughter
men
of
judah
including
the
king
son
and
his
most
prominent
servants
and
carry
off
to
samaria
women
and
children
along
with
a
large
quantity
of
other
booty
the
edomites
and
philistines
also
fall
upon
ahaz
while
the
assyrians
whom
he
has
summoned
to
his
aid
misunderstand
him
and
come
up
against
jerusalem
with
hostile
intent
they
do
not
indeed
carry
the
city
but
yet
become
possessors
without
trouble
of
its
treasures
which
the
king
himself
hands
over
to
them
xxviii
the
book
of
kings
knows
no
worse
ruler
than
manasseh
was
yet
he
reigned
undisturbed
for
years
a
longer
period
than
was
enjoyed
by
any
other
king
this
is
a
stone
of
stumbling
that
chronicles
must
remove
it
tells
that
manasseh
was
carried
in
chains
by
the
assyrians
to
babylon
but
there
prayed
to
jehovah
who
restored
him
to
his
kingdom
he
then
abolished
idolatry
in
judah
xxxiii
thus
on
the
one
hand
he
does
not
escape
punishment
while
on
the
other
hand
the
length
of
his
reign
is
nevertheless
explained
recently
indeed
it
has
been
sought
to
support
the
credibility
of
these
statements
by
means
of
an
assyrian
inscription
from
which
it
appears
that
manasseh
did
pay
tribute
to
esarhaddon
that
is
to
say
he
had
been
overpowered
by
the
assyrians
that
is
again
to
say
that
he
had
been
thrown
into
chains
and
carried
off
by
them
not
so
rapid
but
perhaps
quite
as
accurate
would
be
the
inference
that
as
a
tributary
prince
he
must
have
kept
his
seat
on
the
throne
of
judah
and
not
have
exchanged
it
for
the
prison
of
babylon
in
truth
manasseh
temporary
deposition
is
entirely
on
the
same
plane
with
nebuchadnezzar
temporary
the
unhistorical
character
of
the
intermezzo
the
motives
of
which
are
perfectly
transparent
follows
not
only
from
the
silence
of
the
book
of
kings
a
circumstance
of
no
small
importance
indeed
but
also
for
example
from
jeremiah
xv
for
when
it
is
there
said
that
all
judah
and
jerusalem
are
to
be
given
up
to
destruction
because
of
manasseh
it
is
not
presupposed
that
his
guilt
has
been
already
borne
and
atoned
for
by
himself
to
justify
the
fact
of
josiah
defeat
and
death
at
megiddo
there
is
attached
to
him
the
blame
of
not
having
given
heed
to
the
words
of
necho
from
the
mouth
of
god
warning
him
against
the
struggle
xxxv
contrariwise
the
punishment
of
the
godless
jehoiakim
is
magnified
he
is
stated
to
have
been
put
in
irons
by
the
chaldaeans
and
carried
to
babylon
xxxvi
an
impossibility
of
course
before
the
capture
of
jerusalem
which
did
not
take
place
until
the
third
month
of
his
successor
the
last
prince
of
david
house
zedekiah
having
suffered
more
severely
than
all
his
predecessors
must
therefore
have
been
and
rebellious
characteristics
to
which
according
to
the
authentic
evidence
of
the
prophet
jeremiah
he
had
in
reality
the
least
possible
claim
it
is
thus
apparent
how
inventions
of
the
most
circumstantial
kind
have
arisen
out
of
this
plan
of
writing
history
as
it
is
euphemistically
called
one
is
hardly
warranted
therefore
in
taking
the
definiteness
of
statements
vouched
for
by
chronicles
alone
as
proof
of
their
accuracy
the
story
about
zerah
the
ethiopian
xiv
seq
is
just
as
apocryphal
as
that
of
judges
iii
des
vignoles
has
indeed
identified
the
with
the
osorthon
of
manetho
who
again
occurs
in
the
egyptian
monuments
as
osorkon
son
of
shishak
though
not
as
renewing
the
war
against
palestine
but
osorkon
was
an
egyptian
zerah
an
ethiopian
and
the
resemblance
of
the
names
is
after
all
not
too
obvious
but
even
if
zerah
were
really
a
historical
personage
of
what
avail
would
this
be
for
the
unhistorical
connection
with
a
million
of
men
the
king
of
the
libyans
and
moors
stepping
over
egypt
comes
against
judah
asa
ruler
of
a
land
of
about
sixty
german
square
miles
goes
to
meet
the
enemy
with

defeats
him
on
the
plain
to
the
north
of
mareshah
so
effectually
that
not
a
single
soul
survives
shall
it
be
said
that
this
story
on
account
of
the
accurate
statement
of
locality
although
mareshah
instead
of
gath
is
not
after
all
suggestive
of
an
old
source
is
all
events
after
deduction
of
the
incredibilities
if
the
incredibilities
are
deducted
nothing
at
all
is
left
the
invasion
of
judah
by
baasha
of
israel
and
deportment
towards
him
xv

are
quite
enough
fully
to
dispose
of
the
great
previous
victory
over
the
ethiopians
claimed
for

the
case
is
no
better
with
the
victory
of
jehoshaphat
over
the
ammonites

moabites
xx
here
we
have
probably
an
echo
of
where
we
read
of
jehoshaphat
taking
part
in
a
campaign
against
moab
and
where
also
recurs
that
characteristic
feature
of
the
of
the
enemy
so
that
for
the
opposing
force
nothing
remains
but
the
work

collecting

whose

in

cases
put
them
out
of
the
question
for
the
older

such
statements
as
that
the
ammonites
became
subject
to
kings
uzziah
and
jotham
are
in
the
perfect
silence
of
the
credible
sources
condemned
by
their
inherent
impossibility
for
at
that
period
the
highway
to
ammon
was
moab

this
country
was
by
no
means

possession

upon
the

laid
under

broken

have
established

according

edom

according

was
regarded
as

and
in

list
given
in

xi
we
chiefly
meet
with
names
which
were
also
familiar
in
the
period
that
abijah
deprived
jeroboam
of
bethel
amongst
others
and
that
jehoshaphat
set
governors
over
the
ephraimite
cities
which
had
been
taken
by
asa
his
father
xiii
xvii
would
excite
surprise
if
it
stood
anywhere
else
than
in
chronicles
in
forming
a
judgment
on
its
family
history
of
the
descendants
of
david
the
statement
contained
in
xiii
is
specially
helpful
both
in
manner
and
substance
and
abijah
waxed
mighty
and
he
married
fourteen
wives
and
begat
twenty
and
two
sons
and
sixteen
daughters
this
can
only
be
taken
as
referring
to
the
reign
of
abijah
and
that
too
after
the
alleged
victory
over
jeroboam
but
he
reigned
altogether
for
only
three
years
and
is
it
to
be
supposed
that
within
this
interval
one
of
his
sons
should
even
have
attained
to
man
estate
in
reality
however
abijah
had
no
son
at
all
but
was
succeeded
by
his
brother
for
the
definite
and
doubtless
authentic
statement
that
maachah
the
wife
of
rehoboam
was
the
mother
both
of
abijah
and
of
asa
and
that
the
latter
removed
her
from
her
position
at
court
xv
must
override
the
allegation
of
ver
that
the
successor
of
abijah
was
his
son
after
jehoshaphat
death
it
is
said
in
the
first
place
that
jehoram
slew
all
his
brethren
chr
xxi
and
afterwards
that
the
arabians
slew
all
jehoram
children
with
the
exception
of
one
xxii
how
many
of
the
davidic
house
in
that
case
survive
for
jehu
who
nevertheless
slew
of
them
x
in
short
the
family
history
of
the
house
of
david
is
of
equal
historical
value
with
all
the
other
matters
on
which
the
chronicler
is
more
widely
and
better
informed
than
all
the
older
canonical
books
the
remark
applies
to
names
and
numbers
as
well
about
such
trifles
which
produce
an
appearance
of
accuracy
the
author
is
never
in
any
embarrassment
the
book
of
kings
then
everywhere
crops
up
as
the
real
foundation
of
the
portion
of
chronicles
relating
to
judah
after
the
period
of
solomon
where
the
narrative
of
the
former
is
detailed
and
minute
our
author
also
has
fuller
and
more
interesting
material
at
his
command
so
for
example
in
the
history
relating
to
the
temple
and
to
the
common
and
mutual
relations
of
judah

israel

elsewhere
he
is
restricted
to
the
epitome
that
constitutes
the
framework

book

by
it
he
is
guided
in
his
verdicts
as
to
the
general
character
of
the
successive
sovereigns
as
well
as
in
his
chronological
statements
although
in
accordance
with
his
plan
he
as
a
rule
omits
the
synchronisms
xiii

the
positive
data
also
given
by
the
epitome
with
reference
to
the
legislation
in
matters
of
worship
by
the
various
kings
are
for
the
most
part
reproduced

for
word
and
float
in
a
fragmentary
and
readily
distinguishable
way
in
the
mixture
of
festivals
sermons
choruses
law
and

for
this
is
an
important
verification
of
all
the
results
already
obtained

in

not
derived

uniform
character
not
only
in
its
substance
but
also
in
its
awkward
and
frequently
unintelligible
language
plainly
belonging
to
a
time
in
which
hebrew
was
approaching
extinction
in
its
artificiality
of
style
deriving
its
vitality
exclusively
from
biblical
reminiscences
this
is
not
the
place
for
the
proof
of
these
points
but
the
reader
may
compare
einleitung
seq
bertheau
xiv
and
graf
when
the
narrative
of
chronicles
runs
parallel
with
the
older
historical
books
of
the
canon
it
makes
no
real
additions
but
the
tradition
is
merely
differently
coloured
under
the
influence
of
contemporary
motives
in
the
picture
it
gives
the
writer
own
present
is
reflected
not
antiquity
but
neither
is
the
case
very
different
with
the
genealogical
lists
prefixed
by
way
of
introduction
in
they
also
are
in
the
main
valid
only
for
the
period
at
which
they
were
drawn
up
whether
for
its
actual
condition
or
for
its
conceptions
of
the
past
the
penchant
for
pedigrees
and
genealogical
registers
made
up
from
a
mixture
of
and
elements
is
a
characteristic
feature
of
judaism
along
with
the
thing
the
word
yx
also
first
came
into
use
during
the
later
times
compendious
histories
are
written
in
the
form
of
tldwt
and
ywx
yn
the
thread
is
thin
and
inconspicuous
and
yet
apparently
strong
and
coherent
one
does
not
commit
oneself
to
much
and
yet
has
opportunity
to
introduce
all
kinds
of
interesting
matter
material
comes
to
one
hand
given
a
beginning
and
an
end
the
bridge
is
soon
completed
another
expression
of
the
same
tendency
is
the
inclination
to
give
a
genealogical
expression
to
all
connections
and
associations
of
human
society
whatsoever
to
create
artificial
families
on
all
hands
and
bring
them
into
blood
relationship
as
if
the
whole
of
public
life
resolved
itself
into
a
matter
of
cousinship
an
inclination
indicative
of
the
times
of
political
stagnation
then
prevalent
we
hear
of
the
families
of
the
scribes
at
jabesh
of
the
potters
and
gardeners
and
of
the
sons
of
the
goldsmiths
apothecaries
and
fullers
these
corporations
being
placed
on
the
same
plane
with
actual
families
the
division
into
classes
of
the
persons
engaged
in
religious
service
is
merely
the
most
logical
development
of
this
artificial
system
which
is
applied
to
all
other
social
relations
as
well
proceeding
now
to
a
fuller
examination
of
the
contents
of
chron
and
other
texts
connected
with
that
we
have
here
apart
from
the
first
chapter
which
does
not
demand
further
attention
an
survey
of
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
which
is
based
mostly
on
the
data
of
the
priestly
code
genesis
xlvi
um
xxvi
expanded
now
more
now
less
but
while
the
statements
of
the
priestly
code
have
to
hold
good
for
the
mosaic
period
only
those
of
chronicles
have
also
to
apply
to
the
succeeding
ages
those
for
example
of
saul
and
david
of
and
hezekiah
as
early
as
the
time
of
the
judges
however
very
important
changes
had
taken
place
in
the
conditions
while
dan
continued
to
subsist
with
difficulty
simeon
and
levi
had
been
completely
broken
up
genesis
xlix
in
the
blessing
of
moses
the
latter
name
denotes
something
quite
different
from
a
tribe
and
the
former
is
not
even
so
much
as
named
although
the
enumeration
is
supposed
to
be
complete
in
david
time
it
had
already
been
absorbed
by
families
of
mingled
judaic
and
edomitic
descent
in
the
district
where
it
had
once
had
independent
footing
eastward
of
jordan
leah
had
a
similar
fate
although
somewhat
later
after
it
has
been
deposed
from
its
primacy
in
genesis
xlix
and
twitted
in
judges
with
its
brave
words
unaccompanied
by
corresponding
deeds
the
faint
and
desponding
wish
is
expressed
in
deuteronomy
xxxiii
that
reuben
may
live
and
not
die
and
king
mesha
is
unaware
that
any
other
than
the
gadite
had
ever
dwelt
in
the
land
which
properly
speaking
was
the
heritage
of
reuben
but
in
chronicles
these
extinct
tribes
again
come
to
life
and
not
levi
alone
which
is
a
special
case
but
also
simeon
and
reuben
with
which
alone
we
are
here
to
deal
and
they
exist
as
independent
integral
twelfths
of
israel
precisely
like
ephraim
and
manasseh
throughout
the
whole
period
of
the
monarchy
down
to
the
destruction
of
the
kingdom
by
the
assyrians
this
is
for
reuben
see
in
addition
to
xi
xii
xxvi
xxvii
for
simeon
iv
with
xii
and
xv
xxxiv
observing
that
in
the
last
two
passages
simeon
is
reckoned
as
belonging
to
the
northern
kingdom
so
as
to
complete
the
number
of
the
ten
tribes
diametrically
opposed
to
all
authentic
tradition
for
to
maintain
that
nothing
else
is
intended
than
a
continued
subsistence
of
individual
simeonite
and
reubenite
families
within
other
tribes
is
merely
a
desperate
resort
of
the
harmonists
and
every
attempt
to
tone
down
the
fact
that
those
extinct
and
tribes
are
in
chronicles
placed
side
by
side
with
the
rest
without
any
distinction
is
equally
illegitimate
the
historical
value
thus
lost
by
the
narrative
as
a
whole
can
not
be
restored
by
the
seeming
truthfulness
of
certain
details
or
is
more
significance
really
to
be
attached
to
the
wars
of
the
simeonites
and
reubenites
against
the
arabians
than
to
the
rest
of
the
extemporised
wars
of
the
kings
of
judah
against
these
children
of
the
wilderness
if
only
at
least
the
names
had
not
been
sons
of
ham
and
mehunim
and
hagarenes
iv
seq
heb
as
for
the
pedigrees
and
genealogical
lists
are
they
to
be
accepted
as
historical
merely
because
their
construction
is
not
apparent
to
us
and
they
evade
our
criticism
the
language
affords
no
room
for
the
conjecture
that
we
here
possess
extracts
from
documents
of
high
antiquity
iv
seq
and
proper
names
such
as
elioenai
and
the
like
iv
seq
are
not
striking
for
their
antique
originality
of
the
remaining
tribes
so
far
as
they
belong
to
israel
and
not
to
judah
the
next
in
the
series
after
reuben
are
the
they
are
said
to
have
been
numbered
in
the
days
of
jotham
of
judah
and
jeroboam
of
israel
on
which
occasion
warriors
were
returned
they
took
the
field
against
the
hagarenes
ituraeans
nephishites
and
nabataeans
gaining
the
victory
and
carrying
off
much
booty
for
they
cried
to
god
in
the
battle
and
he
was
entreated
of
them
because
they
put
their
trust
in
him
but
afterwards
they
fell
away
from
the
god
of
their
fathers
and
as
a
punishment
were
carried
off
by
pul
and
to
armenia
by
the
chaboras
and
the
river
of
gozan
apart
from
the
language
which
in
its
edifying
tone
is
that
of
late
judaism
and
leaving
out
of
account
the
enumeration
the
sons
of
reuben
and
the
gadites
and
half
of
the
tribe
of
manasseh
the
astonishing
and
highly
doubtful
combinations
are
eloquent
pul
and
the
chaboras
and
the
river
of
gozan
are
hardly
distinguished
from
each
other
jotham
and
jeroboam
on
the
other
hand
make
so
impossible
a
synchronism
that
the
partisans
of
chronicles
will
have
it
that
none
is
intended
forgetful
to
be
sure
of
hosea
i
and
omitting
to
say
what
in
that
case
jotham
of
judah
has
to
do
here
at
all
in
this
connection
the
hagarenes
and
ituraeans
too
instead
of
say
the
moabites
and
ammonites
furnish
food
for
reflection
as
also
do
the
geographical
statements
that
gad
had
his
seat
in
bashan
and
manasseh
in
and
near
lebanon
as
for
the
proper
names
of
families
and
their
heads
they
are
certainly
beyond
our
means
of
judging
the
phrases
however
of
the
scheme
they
fill
anshe
shemoth
rashe
abotham
migrash
jahes
are
peculiar
to
the
priestly
code
and
chronicles
and
alongside
of
elements
which
are
old
and
attested
from
other
quarters
occur
others
that
look
very
recent
as
for
example
eliel
azriel
jeremiah
hodaviah
jahdiel
in
the
introduction
the
galilaean
tribes
have
no
prominent
place
but
in
the
rest
of
the
book
they
make
a
favourable
appearance
see
especially
xii
and
xxx
it
readily
occurs
to
one
especially
in
the
passage
to
think
of
the
later
judaising
process
in
galilee
in
issachar
there
are
stated
to
have
been
fighting
men
in
david
time
misparam
abotham
vii
out
of
zebulun
and
naphtali
again
exactly
men
came
to
david
at
hebron
to
anoint
him
and
be
feasted
three
days
it
is
carefully
mentioned
however
xii
that
they
took
their
provisions
up
with
them
the
proper
kernel
of
israel
ephraim
and
manasseh
is
in
comparison
with
simeon
reuben
gad
issachar
treated
with
very
scant
kindness
vii
a
suspicious
sign
the
list
of
the
families
of
manasseh
is
an
artificial
of
elements
gleaned
anywhere
maachah
passes
for
the
wife
as
well
as
the
sister
of
machir
but
being
a
gileaditess
ought
not
to
have
been
mentioned
at
all
in
this
place
where
the
manasseh
is
being
spoken
of
to
fill
up
blanks
every
contribution
is
thankfully
received
in
the
case
of
ephraim
a
long
and
meagre
genealogy
kuenen
th
pp
godsdienst
v
i
only
is
given
which
begun
in
vers
and
continued
in
ver
constantly
repeats
the
same
names
tahath
tahan
i
eladah
laadan
shuthelah
telah
and
finally
reaches
its
end
and
goal
in
joshua
whose
father
nun
alone
is
known
to
the
older
sources
into
the
genealogy
a
wonderful
account
of
the
slaying
of
the
children
of
ephraim
by
the
men
of
gath
has
found
its
way
and
like
viii
according
to
the
prevailing
view
must
be
of
venerable
antiquity
but
in
that
case
the
statement
of
iv
must
also
be
very
ancient
which
yet
obviously
is
connected
with
the
rise
of
the
schools
of
the
scribes
stated
in
ii
to
have
existed
in
jabez
everywhere
it
is
presupposed
that
israel
throughout
the
entire
period
of
the
monarchy
was
organised
on
the
basis
of
the
twelve
tribes
xii
xxvii
but
the
assumption
is
certainly
utterly
false
as
can
be
seen
for
example
from
iv
further
the
of
later
judaism
for
statistics
is
carried
back
to
the
earlier
time
to
which
surveys
and
censuses
were
repugnant
in
the
extreme
in
spite
of
we
are
told
that
under
david
enumerations
both
of
the
spiritual
and
of
the
secular
tribes
were
made
again
and
again
so
also
under
his
successors
as
may
be
inferred
partly
from
express
statements
and
partly
from
the
precise
statistics
given
as
to
the
number
of
men
capable
of
bearing
arms
in
these
cases
the
most
astounding
figures
are
set
down
always
however
as
resting
on
original
documents
and
accurate
enumeration
in
the
statistical
information
of
chronicles
then
so
far
as
it
relates
to
antiquity
we
have
to
do
with
artificial
compositions
it
is
possible
and
occasionally
demonstrable
that
in
these
some
elements
derived
from
tradition
have
been
used
but
it
is
certain
that
quite
as
many
have
been
simply
invented
and
the
combination
of
the
elements
the
point
of
chief
importance
dates
as
both
form
and
matter
show
from
the
very
latest
period
one
might
as
well
try
to
hear
the
grass
growing
as
attempt
to
derive
from
such
a
source
as
this
a
historical
knowledge
of
the
conditions
of
ancient
israel
as
regards
judah
and
benjamin
and
to
a
certain
extent
levi
also
the
case
of
course
is
somewhat
different
from
that
of
the
ten
extinct
tribes
it
is
conceivable
that
here
a
living
tradition
may
have
kept
the
present
connected
with
the
past
nevertheless
on
closer
examination
it
comes
out
that
most
of
what
the
chronicler
here
relates
has
reference
to
the
time
and
that
the
few
fragments
which
go
up
to
a
higher
antiquity
are
wrought
into
a
connection
which
on
the
whole
is
of
a
very
recent
date
most
obtrusively
striking
is
it
that
the
list
of
the
heads
of
the
people
dwelling
in
jerusalem
given
in
ix
is
simply
identical
with
nehemiah
xi
in
this
passage
introducing
as
it
does
the
history
of
the
kings
x
seq
one
is
by
no
means
prepared
to
hear
statements
about
the
community
of
the
second
temple
but
our
author
is
under
the
impression
that
in
going
there
he
is
letting
us
know
about
the
old
jerusalem
from
david
to
nehemiah
is
no
leap
for
him
the
times
are
not
distinct
from
one
another
to
his
mind
for
chap
viii
also
containing
a
full
enumeration
of
the
benjamite
families
with
special
reference
to
those
which
had
their
seat
in
the
capital
bertheau
has
proved
the
reference
it
is
interesting
that
in
the
later
jerusalem
there
existed
a
widespread
family
which
wished
to
deduce
its
origin
from
saul
and
rested
its
claims
to
this
descent
on
a
long
genealogy
viii
equivalent
to
ix
which
perhaps
proves
the
later
interpolation
of
ix
it
can
not
be
said
that
this
produces
a
very
favourable
impression
for
the
high
antiquity
of
the
other
list
of
the
benjamites
in
vii
to
see
how
little
value
is
to
be
attached
to
the
pretensions
of
the
latter
to
be
derived
from
original
documents
of
hoary
antiquity
it
is
only
necessary
to
notice
the
genuinely
jewish
phraseology
of
vers
such
proper
names
as
elioenai
and
the
numbers
given
making
in
all
fighting
men
the
registers
of
greatest
historical
value
are
those
relating
to
the
tribe
of
judah
ii
but
in
this
statement
the
genealogy
of
the
descendants
of
david
must
be
excepted
chapter
iii
the
interest
of
which
begins
only
with
zerubbabel
the
rest
being
merely
an
exceedingly
poor
compilation
of
materials
still
accessible
to
us
in
the
older
historical
books
of
the
canon
and
in
jeremiah
according
to
iii
the
first
four
of
sons
born
in
jerusalem
were
all
children
of
bathsheba
the
remaining
seven
are
increased
to
nine
by
a
textual
error
which
occurs
also
in
the
lxx
version
of
among
the
sons
of
josiah
iii
seq
johanan
jehoahaz
is
distinguished
from
shallum
jeremiah
xxii
and
because
he
immediately
succeeded
his
father
is
represented
as
the
though
in
truth
jehoiakim
was
older
xxiii
zedekiah
jehoiakim
brother
is
given
out
to
be
the
son
of
jeconiah
the
son
of
jehoiakim
because
he
was
the
successor
of
jeconiah
who
succeeded
jehoiakim
similar
things
occur
also
in
the
book
of
daniel
but
are
usually
overlooked
with
a
mistaken
piety
whoever
has
eyes
to
see
can
not
assign
any
high
value
except
to
the
two
great
jewish
genealogies
in
chaps
ii
and
iv
yet
even
here
the
most
heterogeneous
elements
are
tossed
together
and
chaff
is
found
mingled
with
wheat
for
further
details
the
reader
is
referred
to
the
dissertation
de
gentibus
et
familiis
judaeis
gottingen
apart
from
the
introduction
chap
ii
is
a
genealogy
of
the
children
of
hezron
a
tribe
which
in
david
time
had
not
yet
been
wholly
amalgamated
with
judah
but
which
even
then
constituted
the
real
strength
of
that
tribe
and
afterwards
became
completely
one
with
it
the
following
scheme
discloses
itself
amid
the
accompanying
matters
the
sons
of
hezron
are
jerahmeel
and
celubai
caleb
ver
and
the
sons
of
jerahmeel
the
of
hezron
were
ver
these
were
the
sons
of
jerahmeel
and
the
sons
of
caleb
the
brother
of
jerahmeel
were
ver
these
were
the
sons
of
caleb
ver
a
that
which
is
thus
formally
defined
and
kept
by
itself
apart
compare
in
this
connection
jerahmeel
the
of
hezron
caleb
the
brother
of
jerahmeel
is
materially
also
distinguished
from
all
else
it
is
the
kernel
of
the
whole
and
refers
to
the
time
even
the
unusual
vers
points
to
this
conclusion
as
well
as
in
the
case
of
caleb
the
positive
fact
that
the
towns
named
in
ver
are
all
situated
near
hebron
and
in
the
negeb
of
judah
where
after
the
exile
the
idumaeans
were
settled
and
in
the
case
of
jerahmeel
the
negative
circumstance
that
here
no
towns
at
all
are
mentioned
among
the
families
molid
ver
being
perhaps
a
single
exception
and
thus
the
extreme
south
is
indicated
but
this
kernel
is
amplified

the

forsaken
their
old
seats

have
taken
up

no
reason

not
doing
so

materials
had
existed

here
as
in

is
traced
backwards

the
father
of

the
father

the
name
of

but
if
anything
at
all
is
certain
it
is
this
that
in
ancient
times
the
calebites
lived
in
the
south
and
not
in
the
north
of
judah
and
in
particular
that
david
by
his
nativity
belonged
not
to
them
but
rather
to
the
older
portion
of
judah
which
gravitated
towards
israel

so

intimate
relations

princely

we
thus
in
point
of

fall
in
with
an
old
kernel
and
one
that
necessarily
goes
back
to
sound
tradition
apparently
preserved
indeed
however
merely
for
the
sake
of
the
later
additions
the
quite
independent
and
parallel
list
on
the
other
hand
contained
in

is
shown
by
many
unmistakable
indications
to
be
a
later
composition
having
its
reference
only
to
conditions
perhaps
incorporating
a
few
older

ix
we
know
that
this
clerical
tribe
is
an
artificial
production
and
that
its
hierarchical
subdivision
as
worked
out
in
the
priestly
code
was
the
result
of
the
centralisation
of
the
cultus
in
jerusalem
further
it
has
been
already
shown
that
in
the
history
as
recorded
in
chronicles
the
effort
is
most
conspicuous
to
represent
the
sons
of
aaron
and
the
levites
in
all
cases
where
they
are
absent
from
the
older
historical
books
of
the
canon
as
playing
the
part
to
which
they
are
entitled
according
to
the
priestly
code
how
immediate
is
the
connection
with
the
document
how
in
a
certain
sense
that
code
is
even
carried
further
by
chronicles
can
be
seen
for
example
from
this
circumstance
that
in
the
former
moses
in
a
novel
reduces
the
period
of
beginning
public
service
in
the
case
of
a
levite
from
thirty
years
of
age
to
numbers
iv
viii
seq
while
in
the
latter
david
xxiii
seq
brings
it
down
still
further
to
the
age
of
twenty
matters
are
still
to
some
extent
in
a
state
of
flux
and
the
ordering
of
the
temple
worship
is
a
continuation
of
the
beginning
made
with
the
tabernacle
service
by
moses
now
in
so
far
as
the
statistics
of
the
clergy
have
a
real
basis
at
all
that
basis
is
it
has
long
ago
been
remarked
how
many
of
the
individuals
figuring
under
david
and
his
successors
asaph
heman
jeduthun
bear
names
identical
with
families
or
guilds
of
a
later
time
how
the
two
indeed
are
constantly
becoming
confluent
and
difficulty
is
felt
in
determining
whether
by
the
expression
head
a
person
or
a
family
ought
to
be
understood
but
inasmuch
as
the
chronicler
nevertheless
desires
to
depict
the
older
time
and
not
his
own
he
by
no
means
adheres
closely
to
contemporary
statistics
but
gives
free
play
at
the
same
time
to
his
idealising
imagination
whence
it
comes
that
in
spite
of
the
numerous
and
apparently
precise
data
afforded
the
reader
still
finds
himself
unable
to
form
any
clear
picture
of
the
organisation
of
the
clergy
the
ordering
of
the
families
and
tribes
the
distribution
of
the
offices
nay
rather
is
involved
in
a
maze
of
contradictions

naturally
the
commentators
are
prompt
with
their
help
by
distinguishing

that
are
alike
and
identifying
names
that
are
different
some
characteristic
details
may
still
be
mentioned
here
the
names
of
the
six
levitical
classes
according
to

simply
the

of

best
of
it
is
that
contrary

the
scope

the
commentators
are
indeed
assisted
in
their
efforts
to
differentiate
the
homonyms
by
their
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
even
as
late
as
nehemiah
time
the
singers
did
not
yet
pass
for
levites
but
their
endeavours
are
wrecked
by
the
circumstance
that

as
of

are

transferred
along

periods
of
the

are
no
better
than
with
the
inferior

far
as
the
books
of

and
kings
are
not
drawn
upon

the
priestly

orders
are
an
institution
not
of
king

of
the
period
when
hitzig
annotating
ezekiel

remarks
that
the
men
standing
between
the
temple
and
the
altar
worshipping
the
sun
toward
the
east
are
the
heads
of
the
priestly
courses
with
the
high
priest
at
their
head
because
no
one
else
had
the
right
to
stand
in
the
inner
court
between
temple
and
altar
he
reveals
a
trait
that
is
characteristic
not
only
of
himself
but
also
of
the
entire
school
who
exert
their
whole
subtlety
on
case
after
case
but
never
give
themselves
time
to
think
matters
over
in
their
connection
with
each
other
nay
rather
simply
retain
the
traditional
view
as
a
whole
only
allowing
themselves
by
way
of
gratification
a
number
of
heresies
it
is
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
hitzig
when
he
annotated
ezekiel
could
have
read
those
passages

xliv
seq
from
which
it
is
most
unambiguously
clear
that
the
later
exclusion
of
the
laity
from

sanctuary
was
quite
unknown
in
the
period
the
extent
of

chronology
the
ancient

is
divided
into
two
periods
each
of
years
the
one
extending
from
the
exodus
to
the
building
of
the
temple
the
other
from
that
epoch
down
to
the
establishment
of
the
second
theocracy
now
years
are
twelve
generations
of
forty
years
and
in
there
are
twelve
high
priests
reckoned
to
the
period
during
which
there
was
no
temple

to
come
after

and
thence
eleven
down
to

exile

is
to
say
twelve
generations
when
the
exile
is
included
the
historical
value
of
the
genealogy
in
is
thus
inevitably
condemned
but
if
chronicles
knew
nothing
about
the
priestly
princes
of
the
olden
time
its
statements
about
ordinary
priests
are
obviously
little
to
be
relied
on
to
speak
of
a
tradition
handed
down
from
times
as
being
found
in
chronicles
either
in
or
in
is
thus
manifestly
out
of
the
question
as
early
as
this
had
been
conclusively
shown
by
the
youthful
de
wette
then
years
of
age
but
since
that
date
many
a
theological
sisyphus
has
toiled
to
roll
the
stone
again
wholly
or
up
the
hill
movers
especially
in
genius
it
might
seem
the
superior
of
the
sober
protestant
critic
with
peculiar
results
this
scholar
mixed
up
the
inquiry
into
the
historical
value
of
those
statements
in
chronicles
which
we
are
able
to
control
with
the
other
question
as
to
the
probable
sources
of
its
variations
from
the
older
historical
books
of
the
canon
in
vain
had
de
wette
at
the
outset
protested
against
such
a
procedure
contending
that
it
was
not
only
possible
but
conceded
that
chronicles
where
at
variance
or
in
contradiction
was
following
older
authority
but
that
the
problem
still
really
was
as
before
how
to
explain
the
complete
difference
of
general
conception
and
the
multitude
of
discrepancies
in
details
that
the
hypothesis
of
sources
as
held
before
movers
by
eichhorn
was
of
no
service
in
dealing
with
this
question
and
that
in
the
critical
comparison
of
the
two
narratives
and
in
testing
their
historical
character
it
was
after
all
incumbent
to
stick
to
what
lay
before
one
pp
for
so
ingenious
an
age
such
principles
were
too
obvious
movers
produced
a
great
impression
especially
as
he
was
not
so
simple
as
to
treat
the
letters
of
hiram
and
elijah
as
authentic
documents
but
was
by
way
of
being
very
critical
at
present
even
dillmann
also
unfortunately
perceives
that
the
chronicler
everywhere
has
worked
according
to
sources
and
that
in
his
case
deliberate
invention
or
distortion
of
the
history
are
not
for
a
moment
to
be
spoken

loitered
so
far
behind

research
as
to
have
thought

resuscitating
the
views

that

be
established
on
an
independent
footing

placed

level

denies

on
its
part
to

from
him
in
reply
to
all
this
one
can
only
repeat
what
has
already
been
said
by
de
wette
it
may
be
that
the
chronicler
has
produced
this
picture
of
old
israel
so
different
in
outline
and
colour
from
the
genuine
tradition
not
of
his
own
suggestion
and
on
his
own
responsibility
but
on
the
ground
of
documents
that
lay
before
him
but
the
historical
character
of
the
work
is
not
hereby
altered
in
the
smallest
degree
it
is
merely
shared
by
the
sources
and
a
multitude
of
other
compositions
have
also
made
use
of
sources
but
how
does
this
enhance
the
value
of
their
statements
that
value
must
in
the
long
run
be
estimated
according
to
their
contents
which
again
must
be
judged
not
by
means
of
the
primary
sources
which
have
been
lost
but
by
means
of
the
secondary
literary
products
which
have
survived
the
whole
question
ultimately
resolves
itself
into
that
of
historical
credibility
and
to
what
conclusions
this
eads
we
have
already
seen
the
alterations
and
additions
of
chronicles
are
all
traceable
to
the
same
the
judaising
of
the
past
in
which
otherwise
the
people
of
that
day
would
have
been
unable
to
recognise
their
ideal
it
was
not
because
tradition
gave
the
law
and
the
hierocracy
and
the
ex
as
sole
efficient
factor
in
the
sacred
narrative
but
because
these
elements
were
felt
to
be
missing
that
they
were
thus
introduced
if
we
are
to
explain
the
by
reference
to
the
author
plan
why
may
we
not
apply
the
same
principle
to
the
the
passion
displayed
by
ewald
jahrbb
x
when
in
speaking
of
the
view
that
manasseh
captivity
has
its
basis
in
jewish
dogmatic
he
calls
it
an
absurdly
infelicitous
idea
and
a
gross
injustice
besides
to
the
book
of
chronicles
recalls
suggestive
remark
about
the
preacher
of
solomon
that
god
would
not
use
a
liar
to
write
a
canonical
book
what
then
does
ewald
say
to
the
narratives
of
daniel
or
jonah
why
must
the
new
turn
given
to
history
in
the
case
of
manasseh
be
judged
by
a
different
standard
than
in
the
equally
gross
case
of
ahaz
and
in
the
numerous
analogous
instances
enumerated
in
preceding
pages
with
what
show
of
justice
can
the
chronicler
after
his
statements
have
over
and
over
again
been
shown
to
be
incredible
be
held
at
discretion
to
pass
for
an
unimpeachable
narrator
in
those
cases
at
least
where
its
connection
with
his
plan
is
obvious
one
ought
surely
to
exercise
some
scepticism
in
regard
to
his
testimony
but
it
ought
at
the
same
time
to
be
considered
that
such
connections
may
occur
much
oftener
than
is
discernible
by
us
or
at
least
by
the
less
of
us
it
is
indeed
possible
that
occasionally
a
grain
of
good
corn
may
occur
among
the
chaff
but
to
be
conscientious
one
must
neglect
this
possibility
of
exceptions
and
give
due
honour
to
the
probability
of
the
rule
for
it
is
only
too
easy
to
deceive
oneself
in
thinking
that
one
has
come
upon
some
sound
particular
in
a
tainted
whole
to
what
is
said
in
so
david
dwelt
in
the
stronghold
jebus
and
he
called
it
the
city
of
david
and
he
built
round
about
from
the
rampart
and
inward
there
is
added
in
xi
the
statement
that
joab
restored
the
rest
of
the
city
jerusalem
this
looks
innocent
enough
and
is
generally
accepted
as
a
fact
but
the
word
xyh
for
bnh
shows
the
comparatively
modern
date
of
the
statement
and
on
closer
consideration
one
remembers
also
that
the
town
of
jebus
at
the
time
of
its
conquest
by
david
consisted
only
of
the
citadel
and
the
new
town
did
not
come
into
existence
at
all
until
later
and
therefore
could
not
have
been
repaired
by
joab
in
what
interest
the
statement
was
made
can
be
gathered
from
nehemiah
vii
in
many
cases
it
is
usual
to
regard
such
additions
as
having
had
their
origin
in
a
better
text
of
samuel
and
kings
which
lay
before
the
chronicler
and
this
certainly
is
the
most
likely
way
in
which
good
additions
could
have
got
in
but
the
textual
critics
of
the
are
only
too
with
the
chronicler
and
are
always
eagerly
seizing
with
both
hands
his
paste
pearls
and
the
similar
gifts
of
the
septuagint
it
must
be
allowed
that
chronicles
owes
its
origin
not
to
the
arbitrary
caprice
of
an
individual
but
to
a
general
tendency
of
its
period
it
is
the
inevitable
product
of
the
conviction
that
the
mosaic
law
is
the
of
israel
history
and
that
in
it
these
is
operative
a
play
of
sacred
forces
such
as
finds
no
other
analogy
this
conviction
could
not
but
lead
to
a
complete
transformation
of
the
ancient
tradition
starting
from
a
similar
assumption
such
an
author
as
keil
could
even
at
the
present
day
write
a
book
of
chronicles
if
this
were
not
already
in
existence
now
in
this
aspect
for
the
purpose
of
appraising
chronicles
as
the
type
of
that
conception
of
history
which
the
scribes
cherished
the
inquiry
into
its
sources
is
really
important
and
interesting
references
to
other
writings
from
which
further
particulars
can
be
learned
are
appended
as
a
rule
to
the
account
of
each
sovereign
reign
the
exceptions
being
in
the
cases
of
joram
ahaziah
athaliah
amon
jehoahaz
jehoiakim
zedekiah
the
titles
referred
to
in
this
way
may
be
classed
under
two
groups
the
book
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
judah
or
of
judah
and
israel
in
the
cases
of
asa
amaziah

which
the
book
of
the
kings

identical

citations
it

always
one
and
the

is
intended
whether
by
its
collective
title
or
by
the
conventional
of
its
separate
sections
bertheau
calls

also
the
chronicler
has
not
used
so
many
sources
as
are
usually
supposed
there
is
no
reason
for
refusing
to
identify
the
lamentations
of

with
our
lamentations
of
jeremiah
at
least
the
reference
to
the
death
of
josiah
ant
x
erroneously
attributed
to
them
ought
not
in
candour
to
be
regarded
as
such
attention
to
the
fact
that
ordinarily
it
is
either
the
one
or
the
other
title
that
is
given
and
when
as
is
less
usual
there
are
two
then
for
the
most
part
the
prophetic
writing
is
designated
as
a
portion
of
the
book
of
the
kings

quite
vaguely

the
peculiar

en

how
stands
it

in
the

has
its
origin
in
the
idea
that
each
period
of
the
sacred
history
has
its
leading
prophet

also
at

according

in
spite
of
ix

xiii
xxix
the
notion
that
each
prophet
has
himself
written
the
history
of
his
own
period
obviously
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
title
borne
by
the
books
of
joshua
judges
samuel
and
kings
in
the
jewish
canon
and
of
the
view
which
led
to
the
introduction
of
xviii
seq
into
the
book
of
isaiah
the
claims
of
history
being
slight
it
was
easy
to
find
the
needful
for
each
section
jehu
ben

a
northern
israelite
of
baasha

has
to
do
duty
for

and
also
for

prophesied

jeroboam
ben

is
the
anonymous
prophet
of

ant
viii
jer
on
zechariah
i
by
this
time
it
was
possible
also
to
give
the
names
of
the
wives
of
cain
and
of
the
patriarchs
as
regards
a
more
definite
determination
of
the
date
of
the
book
of
kings
which
lies
at
the
foundation
of
chronicles
a
of
the
two
series
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
judah
can
only
have
been
made
after
both
had
been
brought
to
a
close
in
other
words
not
before
the
babylonian
exile
and
in
the
babylonian
exile
it
was
that
the
canonical
book
of
kings
actually
came
into
existence
and
the
chronicles
of
israel
and
those
of
judah
were
for
the
first
time
worked
together
by
its
author
at
least
he
refers
only
to
the
separate
works
and
knows
of
no
previous
combination
of
them
it
would
seem
therefore
very
natural
to
identify
the
work
alluded
to
in
chronicles
with
our
present
canonical
book
which
is
similar
in
title
and
has
corresponding
contents
but
this
we
can
not
do
for
in
the
former
there
were
matters
of
which
there
are
in
the
latter
no
trace
for
example
according
to
ix
it
contained
family
and
numerical
statistics
for
the
whole
of
israel
after
the
manner
of
chapters
for
the
most
part
borrowed
from
it
and
according
to
xxxiii
the
prayer
of
manasseh
from
these
two
data
as
well
as
from
the
character
of
the
items
of
information
which
may
have
been
conjectured
to
have
been
derived
from
this
source
the
conclusion
is
forced
upon
us
that
the
book
of
kings
cited
by
the
chronicler
is
a
late
compilation
far
removed
from
actual
tradition
and
in
relation
to
the
canonical
book
of
kings
it
can
only
be
explained
as
an
apocryphal
amplification
after
the
manner
in
which
the
scribes
treated
the
sacred
history
this
conclusion
derived
from
the
contents
themselves
is
supported
by
an
important
positive
datum
namely
the
citation
in
xxiv
of
the
midrash
story
of
the
book
of
kings
and
in
xiii
of
the
midrash
of
the
prophet
iddo
ewald
is
undoubtedly
right
when
he
recognises
here
the
true
title
of
the
writing
elsewhere
named
simply
the
book
of
kings
of
course
the
commentators
assert
that
the
word
midrash
which
occurs
in
the
bible
only
in
these
two
passages
there
means
something
quite
different
from
what
it
means
everywhere
else
but
the
natural
sense
suits
admirably
well
and
in
chronicles
we
find
ourselves
fully
within
the
period
of
the
scribes
midrash
is
the
consequence
of
the
conservation
of
all
the
relics
of
antiquity
a
wholly
peculiar
artificial
reawakening
of
dry
bones
especially
by
literary
means
as
is
shown
by
the
preference
for
lists
of
names
and
numbers
like
ivy
it
overspreads
the
dead
trunk
with
extraneous
life
blending
old
and
new
in
a
strange
combination
it
is
a
high
estimate
of
tradition
that
leads
to
its
being
thus
modernised
but
in
the
process
it
is
twisted
and
perverted
and
set
off
with
foreign
accretions
in
the
most
arbitrary
way
jonah
as
well
as
daniel
and
a
multitude
of
apocryphal
writings
ii
are
connected
with
this
tendency
to
cast
the
reflection
of
the
present
back
into
the
past
the
prayer
of
manasseh
which
now
survives
only
in
greek
appears
as
ewald
has
conjectured
actually
to
have
been
taken
direct
from
the
book
quoted
in
xxxiii
within
this
sphere
wherein
all
judaism
moves
chronicles
also
has
had
its
rise
thus
whether
one
says
chromcles
or
midrash
of
the
book
of
kings
is
on
the
whole
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
they
are
children
of
the
same
mother
and
indistinguishable
in
spirit
and
language
while
on
the
other
hand
the
portions
which
have
been
retained
verbatim
from
the
canonical
book
of
kings
at
once
betray
themselves
in
both
respects
chapter
vii
judges
samuel
and
kings
in
the
history
of
hebrew
literature
so
full
as
it
is
of
unfortunate
accidents
one
lucky
circumstance
at
least
requires
to
be
specially
mentioned
chronicles
did
not
succeed
in
superseding
the
historical
books
upon
which
it
was
founded
the
older
and
the
newer
version
have
been
preserved
together
but
in
judges
samuel
and
kings
even
we
are
not
presented
with
tradition
purely
in
its
original
condition
already
it
is
overgrown
with
later
accretions
alongside
of
an
older
narrative
a
new
one
has
sprung
up
formerly
independent
and
intelligible
in
itself
though
in
many
instances
of
course
adapting
itself
to
the
former
more
frequently
the
new
forces
have
not
caused
the
old
root
to
send
forth
a
new
stock
or
even
so
much
as
a
complete
branch
they
have
only
nourished
parasitic
growths
the
earlier
narrative
has
become
clothed
with
minor
and
dependent
additions
to
vary
the
metaphor
the
whole
area
of
tradition
has
finally
been
uniformly
covered
with
an
alluvial
deposit
by
which
the
configuration
of
the
surface
has
been
determined
it
is
with
this
last
that
we
have
to
deal
in
the
first
instance
to
ascertain
its
character
to
find
out
what
the
active
forces
were
by
which
it
was
produced
only
afterwards
are
we
in
a
position
to
attempt
to
discern
in
the
earlier
underlying
formation
the
changing
spirit
of
each
successive
period
the
following
prologue
supplies
us
with
the
point
of
view
from
which
the
period
of
the
judges
is
estimated
after
the
death
of
joshua
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
forsook
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
who
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
followed
other
gods
of
the
gods
of
the
people
that
were
round
about
them
the
baals
and
astartes
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
hot
against
israel
and
he
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
spoilers
that
spoiled
them
and
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
their
enemies
round
about
whithersoever
they
went
out
the
hand
of
the
lord
was
against
them
for
evil
as
the
lord
had
said
and
as
the
lord
had
sworn
unto
them
and
they
were
greatly
distressed
nevertheless
the
lord
raised
up
unto
them
judges
and
was
with
the
judge
and
delivered
them
out
of
the
hand
of
their
enemies
all
the
days
of
the
judge
for
it
repented
the
lord
because
of
their
groanings
by
reason
of
them
that
oppressed
them
and
vexed
them
and
it
came
to
pass
when
the
judge
was
dead
that
they
returned
and
corrupted
themselves
more
than
their
fathers
in
following
other
gods
to
serve
them
they
ceased
not
from
their
own
doings
nor
from
their
stubborn
way
and
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
hot
against
israel
judges
such
is
the
text
afterwards
come
the
examples
and
the
children
of
israel
did
evil
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
forget
the
lord
their
god
and
served
the
baals
and
astartes
therefore
the
anger
of
the
lord
was
hot
against
israel
and
he
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
king
of
mesopotamia
and
they
served
him
eight
years
and
when
the
children
of
israel
cried
unto
the
lord
the
lord
raised
up
to
them
a
helper
othniel
kenaz
and
delivered
the
king
of
mesopotamia
into
his
hand
and
the
land
had
rest
forty
years
and
othniel
kenaz
died
the
same
points
of
view
and
also
for
the
most
part
the
same
expressions
as
those
which
in
the
case
of
othniel
fill
up
the
entire
cadre
recur
in
the
cases
of
ehud
deborah
gideon
jephthah
and
samson
but
there
form
only
at
the
beginning
and
at
the
end
of
the
narratives
a
frame
which
encloses
more
copious
and
richer
contents
occasionally
they
expand
into
more
exhaustive
disquisitions
as
in
vi
x
it
is
in
this
way
that
judges
has
been
constructed
with
the
regularity
it
displays
only
the
six
great
judges
however
are
included
within
the
scheme
the
six
small
ones
stand
in
an
external
relation
to
it
and
have
a
special
scheme
to
themselves
doubtless
having
been
first
added
by
way
of
appendix
to
complete
the
number
twelve
the
features
which
characterise
this
method
of
historical
work
are
few
and
strongly
distinctive
a
continuous
chronology
connects
the
times
of
rest
and
their
separating
intervals
and
thereby
the
continuity
of
the
periods
is
secured
in
order
justly
to
estimate
this
chronology
it
is
necessary
to
travel
somewhat
beyond
the
limits
of
judges
the
key
to
it
is
to
be
found
in
vi
in
the
four
hundred
and
eightieth
year
after
the
children
of
israel
were
come
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
in
the
fourth
year
of
the
reign
of
solomon
he
began
to
build
the
house
of
the
lord
as
observed
by
bertheau
and
afterwards
by
noldeke
who
has
still
farther
pursued
the
subject
these
years
correspond
to
generations
of
years
each
analogously
in
vi
high
priests
from
aaron
to
ahimaaz
are
assumed
for
the
same
period
of
time
and
the
attempt
was
made
to
make
their
successions
determine
those
of
the
generations
numbers
xxxv
now
it
is
certainly
by
no
means
at
once
clear
how
this
total
is
to
be
brought
into
accord
with
the
individual
entries
yet
even
these
make
it
abundantly
plain
that
is
the
fundamental
number
of
the
reckoning
the
wandering
in
the
wilderness
during
which
the
generation
born
in
egypt
dies
out
lasts
for
years
the
land
has
years
of
rest
under
othniel
deborah
and
again
under
gideon
it
has
under
ehud
the
domination
of
the
philistines
lasts
for
years
the
duration
also
of
david
reign
on
the
necessary
assumption
that
the
period
of
the
philistines
judges
xiii
which
far
exceeds
the
ordinary
duration
of
the
foreign
dominations
coincides
with
that
of
eli
iv
and
at
the
same
time
includes
the
years
of
samson
judges
xvi
and
the
of
the
interregnum
before
samuel
vii
we
have
already
x
accounted
for
while
x
still
remain
for
these
we
must
take
into
account
first
the
years
of
the
two
generations
for
which
no
numbers
are
given
namely
the
generation
of
joshua
and
his
surviving
contemporaries
judges
ii
and
that
of
samuel
to
saul
each
it
may
be
conjectured
having
the
normal
and
the
two
together
certainly
reckoning
years
for
the
remaining
the
most
disputable
elements
are
the
years
of
interregna
or
of
foreign
dominations
and
the
of
the
minor
judges
one
perceives
that
these
two
figures
can
not
both
be
counted
in
they
are
mutually
exclusive
equivalents
for
my
own
part
i
prefer
to
retain
the
interregna
they
alone
so
far
as
we
can
see
at
present
being
appropriate
to
the
peculiar
scheme
of
the
book
of
judges
the
balance
of
or
io
years
still
remaining
to
be
applied
are
distributed
between
jephthah
years
and
solomon
down
to
the
building
of
the
temple
who
claims
or
years
or
if
these
are
left
out
of
account
years
may
be
given
to
abimelech
the
main
thing
however
is
not
the
chronology
but
the
religious
connection
of
the
events
the
two
are
intimately
associated
not
only
formally
as
can
be
gathered
from
the
scheme
but
also
by
a
real
inner
connection
for
what
is
aimed
at
in
both
alike
is
a
connected
view
of
large
periods
of
time
a
continuous
survey
of
the
connection
and
succession
of
race
after
race
the
detailed
particulars
of
the
occurrences
being
disregarded
the
historical
factors
with
which
the
religious
pragmatism
here
has
to
do
are
so
uniform
that
the
individual
periods
in
reality
need
only
to
be
filled
up
with
the
numbers
of
the
years
one
is
reminded
of
the
satz
gegensatz
and
vermittelung
of
the
hegelian
philosophy
when
one
ear
has
once
been
caught
by
the
monotonous
beat
with
which
the
history
here
advances
or
rather
moves
in
a
circle
rebellion
affliction
conversion
peace
rebellion
affliction
conversion
peace
the
sole
subjects
of
all
that
is
said
are
jehovah
and
israel
their
mutual
relation
alone
it
is
that
keeps
the
course
of
things
in
motion
and
that
too
in
opposite
directions
so
that
in
the
end
matters
always
return
to
their
original
position
they
did
what
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
jehovah
they
went
after
strange
gods
is
the
uninterrupted
although
jehovistic
monolatry
is
so
potently
recommended
from
without
it
yet
takes
no
firm
root
never
becomes
natural
to
the
people
always
remains
a
precept
above
and
beyond
their
powers
for
decennia
on
end
indeed
they
hold
fast
to
it
but
soon
their
idolatrous
tendency
which
has
only
been
repressed
by
fear
of
the
judge
during
his
lifetime
again
finds
expression
they
must
have
a
change
now
this
rebellion
is
indeed
quite
indispensable
for
the
pragmatism
because
otherwise
there
would
be
nothing
at
all
to
tell
it
is
on
the
unrest
in
the
clock
that
the
whole
movement
depends
but
at
the
same
time
this
is
of
course
no
extenuation
the
conduct
of
the
people
is
manifestly
totally
inexcusable
the
main
actions
the
deeds
of
the
judges
are
for
this
manner
of
historical
treatment
always
only
proofs
of
israel
sin
and
of
the
unmerited
grace
of
jehovah
that
puts
them
to
shame
that
all
this
is
no
part
of
the
original
contents
of
the
tradition
but
merely
a
uniform
in
which
it
is
clothed
is
admitted
deus
impare
it
is
usual
to
call
this
later
revision
deuteronomistic
the
law
which
jehovah
has
enjoined
upon
the
fathers
and
the
breach
of
which
he
has
threatened
severely
to
punish
ii
is
not
indeed
more
definitely
characterised
but
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
that
its
quintessence
is
the
injunction
to
worship
jehovah
alone
and
no
other
god
now
in
this
connection
it
is
impossible
to
think
of
the
priestly
code
for
in
that
document
such
a
command
is
nowhere
expressly
enjoined
but
on
the
contrary
is
assumed
as
a
matter
of
course
deuteronomy
on
the
other
hand
has
in
fact
no
precept
on
which
it
lays
greater
emphasis
than
the
hear
o
jehovah
is
the
only
god
and
the
worship
of
strange
gods
the
sin
of
sins
this
precept
was
apprehended
much
more
clearly
by
contemporaries
than
the
moral
demands
in
the
interest
of
humanity
and
kindness
which
are
also
insisted
on
in
deuteronomy
but
are
not
new
being
derived
from
older
collections
on
this
side
alone
in
so
far
as
it
follows
up
the
monotheism
of
the
prophets
into
its
practical
consequences
within
the
sphere
of
worship
has
josiah
had
historical
importance
on
this
side
alone
has
it
continued
to
act
upon
ezekiel
and
those
who
came
after
him
if
then
the
norm
of
the
theocratic
relationship
assumed
in
the
redaction
of
the
book
of
judges
is
to
be
sought
in
a
written
torah
this
can
indubitably
only
be
that
of
deuteronomy
the
decisive
settlement
of
the
question
depends
in
a
comparison
with
the
book
of
kings
and
must
accordingly
be
postponed
until
then
as
for
the
relation
between
this
superstructure
and
that
on
which
it
rests
there
is
a
striking
difference
between
the
two
styles
the
revised
form
in
which
the
book
of
judges
found
its
way
into
the
canon
is
unquestionably
of
judaean
origin
but
the
histories
themselves
are
not
such
nay
in
the
song
of
deborah
judah
is
not
reckoned
at
all
as
belonging
to
israel
the
one
judge
who
belongs
to
the
tribe
of
judah
is
othniel
who
however
is
not
a
person
but
only
a
clan
what
is
said
of
him
is
quite
void
of
contents
and
is
made
up
merely
of
the
schematic
devices
of
the
redactor
who
has
set
himself
to
work
here
so
as
to
make
the
series
open
with
a
man
of
judah
the
selection
of
othniel
was
readily
suggested
by
judges
i
here
again
we
have
an
exception
which
proves
the
rule
more
important
are
the
inner
differences
which
reveal
themselves
to
begin
with
the
most
general
the
historical
continuity
on
which
so
much
stress
is
laid
by
the
scheme
is
in
no
way
shown
in
the
individual
narratives
of
the
book
of
judges
these
stand
beside
one
another
unconnectedly
and
without
any
regard
to
order
or
sequence
like
isolated
points
of
light
which
emerge
here
and
there
out
of
the
darkness
of
forgetfulness
they
make
no
presence
of
actually
filling
up
any
considerable
space
of
time
they
afford
no
points
of
attachment
whereon
to
fasten
a
chronology
in
truth
it
is
hardly
the
dim
semblance
of
a
continuity
that
is
imparted
to
the
tradition
by
the
empty
framework
of
the
scheme
the
conception
of
a
period
of
the
judges
between
joshua
and
saul
during
which
judges
ruled
over
israel
and
succeeded
one
another
almost
as
regularly
as
did
the
kings
at
a
later
period
is
quite
foreign
to
that
tradition
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
that
judges
xviii
have
the
best
right
to
be
reckoned
as
belonging
to
the
original
stock
but
these
portions
are
excluded
from
reception
within
the
scheme
because
they
have
nothing
to
say
about
any
judges
and
give
a
picture
of
the
general
state
of
affairs
which
accords
but
ill
with
that
plan
the
redaction
as
is
well
knows
extends
only
from
ii
xvi
thus
excluding
both
i
and
xvii
but
it
is
easy
to
perceive
how
excellently
the
first
portion
fits
into
its
place
as
a
general
introduction
to
the
period
between
moses
and
the
monarchy
and
how
much
more
informing
and
instructive
it
is
in
this
respect
than
the
section
which
follows
there
exists
besides
a
formal
connection
between
i
and
iv
as
regards
chaps
this
story
relating
to
the
migration
of
dan
northwards
is
plainly
connected
with
that
immediately
preceding
where
the
tribe
still
finds
itself
in
tbe
camp
of
dan
but
is
hard
pressed
and
obtains
no
relief
even
with
the
aid
of
samson
in
the
case
of
chaps
indeed
it
admits
of
doubt
whether
they
were
excluded
from
the
redaction
or
whether
they
were
not
extant
as
yet
but
it
is
worth
noticing
that
here
also
chaps
xviii
are
assumed
as
having
gone
before
the
levite
of
testifies
to
this
and
especially
the
reminiscence
contained
in
xix
which
as
we
shall
see
has
nothing
to
rest
on
in
chaps
compare
further
xx
with
i
seq
at
the
bottom
of
the
spurious
continuity
lies
an
erroneous
widening
of
the
areas
in
which
the
judges
exerted
their
influence
out
of
local
contiguity
has
arisen
succession
in
time
what
was
true
of
the
part
having
been
transferred
to
the
whole
it
is
always
the
children
of
israel
in
a
body
who
come
upon
the
scene
are
oppressed
by
the
enemy
and
ruled
by
the
judges
in
reality
it
is
only
the
individual
tribes
that
come
into
the
action
the
judges
are
tribal
heroes
ehud
of
benjamin
barak
and
deborah
of
issachar
gideon
of
joseph
jephthah
of
gilead
samson
of
dan
it
was
only
for
the
struggle
against
sisera
that
a
number
of
tribes
were
united
receiving
on
that
account
extraordinary
praise
in
the
song
of
deborah
it
is
nowhere
said
at
the
time
when
the
judges
ruled
but
at
the
time
when
there
was
yet
no
king
over
israel
and
every
man
did
what
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
the
regular
constitution
of
the
period
is
the
patriarchal
anarchy
of
the
system
of
families
and
septs
and
in
chap
i
division
and
isolation
are
made
to
appear
not
unclearly
as
the
reason
why
the
canaanites
were
so
long
of
being
driven
out
from
the
greater
cities
matters
did
not
change
until
israel
became
strong
that
is
to
say
until
his
forces
were
welded
into
one
by
means
of
the
monarchy
but
the
unity
of
israel
is
the
presupposition
upon
which
rests
the
theocratic
relation
the
reciprocal
attitude
between
israel
and
jehovah
whereby
according
to
the
scheme
the
course
of
the
history
is
solely
conditioned
in
the
genuine
tradition
the
presupposition
disappears
and
in
connection
with
this
the
whole
historical
process
assumes
an
essentially
different
not
to
say
a
more
natural
aspect
the
people
are
no
longer
as
a
body
driven
hither
and
thither
by
the
same
internal
and
external
impulses
and
everything
that
happens
is
no
longer
made
to
depend
on
the
attraction
and
repulsion
exercised
by
jehovah
instead
of
the
alternating
of
absolute
peace
and
absolute
affliction
there
prevails
throughout
the
whole
period
a
relative
unrest
here
peace
there
struggle
and
conflict
failure
and
success
alternate
but
not
as
the
uniform
consequences
of
loyalty
or
disobedience
to
the
covenant
when
the
anonymous
prophet
who
in
the
insertion
in
the
last
redaction
chap
vi
makes
his
appearance
as
suddenly
as
his
withdrawal
is
abrupt
improves
the
visitation
of
the
midianites
as
the
text
for
a
penitential
discourse
the
matter
is
nevertheless
looked
at
immediately
thereafter
with
quite
different
eyes
for
to
the
greeting
of
the
angel
jehovah
is
with
thee
thou
mighty
man
of
velour
gideon
answers
if
jehovah
be
with
us
why
then
is
all
this
befallen
us
and
where
be
all
his
miracles
of
which
our
fathers
told
us
he
knows
nothing
about
any
guilt
on
the
part
of
israel
similarly
the
heroic
figures
of
the
judges
refuse
to
fit
in
with
the
story
of
sin
and
rebellion
they
are
the
pride
of
their
countrymen
and
not
humiliating
reminders
that
jehovah
had
undeservedly
again
and
again
made
good
that
which
men
had
destroyed
finally
with
what
artificiality
the
sins
which
appear
to
be
called
for
are
produced
is
incidentally
made
very
clear
after
the
death
of
gideon
we
read
in
chap
viii
the
children
of
israel
went
after
the
baals
and
made
baal
berith
their
god
but
from
the
following
chapter
it
appears
that
baal
or
el
berith
was
only
the
patron
god
of
shechem
and
some
other
cities
belonging
to
the
canaanites
the
redactor
transforms
the
local
worship
of
the
canaanites
into
an
idolatrous
worship
on
the
part
of
all
israel
in
other
cases
his
procedure
is
still
more
simple
for
example
in
x
where
the
number
seven
in
the
case
of
the
deities
corresponds
with
the
number
seven
of
the
nations
mentioned
in
that
connection
ordinarily
he
is
content
with
baals
or
astartes
or
asheras
where
the
plural
number
is
enough
to
show
how
little
of
what
is
individual
or
positive
underlies
the
idea
not
to
mention
that
asheras
are
no
divinities
at
all
but
only
sacred
trees
or
poles
in
short
what
is
usually
given
out
as
the
peculiar
theocratic
element
in
the
history
of
israel
is
the
element
which
has
been
introduced
by
the
redaction
there
sin
and
grace
are
introduced
as
forces
into
the
order
of
events
in
the
most
mechanical
way
the
course
of
events
is
systematically
withdrawn
from
all
analogy
miracles
are
nothing
extraordinary
but
are
the
regular
form
in
which
things
occur
are
matters
of
course
and
produce
absolutely
no
impression
this
pedantic
sacred
history
according
to
the
approved
recipe
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
original
accounts
in
these
israel
is
a
people
just
like
other
people
nor
is
even
his
relationship
to
jehovah
otherwise
conceived
of
than
is
for
example
that
of
moab
to
chemosh
chap
xi
of
theophanies
and
manifestations
of
the
godhead
there
is
no
lack
but
the
wonders
are
such
as
to
make
one
really
wonder
once
and
again
they
interrupt
the
earthly
nexus
but
at
the
same
time
they
form
no
connected
system
they
are
poetry
not
prose
and
dogma
but
on
the
whole
the
process
of
history
although
to
appearance
rougher
and
more
perplexed
is
nevertheless
in
reality
much
more
intelligible
and
though
seemingly
more
broken
up
actually
advances
more
continuously
there
is
an
ascent
upward
to
the
monarchy
not
a
descent
from
the

one
narrative
it
is
true
apart
from
that
relating
to
othniel
which
is
not
to
be
reckoned
here
is
exactly
what
sacred
history
ought
to
be
in
order
to
fit
into
the
theoretical
scheme
i
mean
judges
to
appreciate
it
rightly
it
will
be
well
first
of
all
to
cast
a
glance
upon
the
preceding
narrative
relating
to
the
migration
of
the
tribe
of
dan
to
the
north
the
danites
strong
fall
upon
the
canaanite
town
of
laish
not
because
it
lies
within
the
limits
assigned
to
the
people
of
god
and
because
its
conquest
is
a
duty
though
they
inquire
of
the
oracle
they
are
nevertheless
far
from
relying
on
the
divine
right
so
plainly
made
known
in
the
book
of
joshua
but
because
it
is
inhabited
by
a
peaceable
and
unsuspecting
people
which
is
quite
defenceless
against
such
a
band
of
desperadoes
and
they
have
as
little
scruple
in
practicing
the
same
treachery
to
israelites
such
as
micah
they
take
it
that
might
is
right
and
recognise
no
restraining
consideration
their
conduct
is
natural
to
the
verge
of
absolute
shamelessness
and
yet
they
are
pious
in
their
way
how
highly
they
value
jehovah
they
show
by
this
that
they
steal
his
image
out
of
the
house
of
god
and
the
priest
who
keeps
it
into
the
bargain
as
for
the
religious
usages
mentioned
in
the
two
chapters
hardly
an
abomination
forbidden
by
the
law
is
wanting
the
private
sanctuary
in
the
possession
of
the
ephraimite
micah
the
grandson
of
moses
as
priest
in
his
service
and
pay
ephod
and
teraphim
as
the
requisite
necessaries
in
the
worship
of
jehovah
and
yet
all
this
is
so
recounted
by
the
narrator
as
if
it
were
all
quite
regular
and
void
of
offence
although
his
purpose
in
doing
so
is
not
to
narrate
temporary
departures
from
rule
but
the
origin
of
permanent
institutions
at
a
chief
sanctuary
of
ancient
israel
one
is
translated
into
another
world
on
passing
from
this
to
the
narrative
immediately
following
about
the
shameful
deed
of
the
benjamites
and
their
exemplary
punishment
a
greater
or
more
instructive
contrast
as
regards
religious
history
is
hardly
to
be
found
in
all
the
old
testament
in
judges
it
is
not
as
invariably
elsewhere
the
individual
tribes
which
act
not
even
the
people
israel
but
the
congregation
of
the
covenant
which
has
its
basis
in
the
unity
of
worship
the
occasion
of
their
action
is
a
sin
committed
in
their
midst
which
must
be
done
away
it
is
the
sanctity
of
the
theocracy
which
brings
these
men
to
arms
and
fills
them
at
once
with
unction
and
with
sanguinary
zeal
the
clerical
instincts
have
entirely
taken
possession
of
this
uniform
mass
have
passed
into
their
flesh
and
blood
and
moulded
them
into
a
single
automaton
so
that
all
that
takes
place
is
invariably
done
by
all
at
once
no
individuals
come
to
the
front
not
even
by
name
still
less
by
deeds
of
velour
the
moral
tone
is
anything
but
heroic
when
the
godless
reprobates
of
gibeah
seek
to
assail
the
person
of
the
levite
who
is
passing
the
night
there
he
hands
over
to
them
his
wife
in
order
to
save
himself
and
all
israel
finds
nothing
objectionable
in
this
revolting
act
of
cowardice
the
opinion
probably
being
that
by
his
conduct
the
holy
man
had
kept
the
sinners
from
still
graver
guilt
of
the
mosaic
law
not
a
word
is
said
in
these
chapters
but
who
could
fail
to
perceive
that
the
spirit
which
finds
its
expression
in
the
law
pervaded
the
community
which
acted
thus
had
we
more
narratives
of
similar
contents
we
should
be
able
to
solve
many
a
riddle
of
the
pentateuch
where
under
the
monarchy
could
we
find
an
israel
so
united
vigorous
earnest
so
willing
to
enter
upon
the
severest
conflict
for
the
sake
of
the
highest
ends
thus
bertheau
rightly
feeling
that
this
story
has
a
quite
exceptional
position
and
contradicts
all
that
we
learn
from
other
quarters
of
the
period
of
the
judges
or
even
the
kings
only
we
can
not
reckon
it
a
proof
of
the
historic
value
of
the
story
that
it
gives
the
lie
to
the
rest
of
the
tradition
in
the
books
of
judges
samuel
and
kings
and
is
homogeneous
not
with
these
books
but
with
the
law
on
the
other
hand
the
writer
betrays
himself
with
a
when
unconsciously
remembering
the
preceding
chapters
he
laments
the
disorganisation
of
the
time
he
is
dealing
with
xix
xxi
and
yet
describes
israel
to
us
as
existing
in
a
religious
centralisation
such
as
demonstrably
was
never
attained
in
the
earlier
life
of
the
nation
but
only
came
about
as
a
consequence
of
the
exile
and
is
the
distinctive
mark
of
judaism
as
this
narrative
is
not
one
of
those
included
in
the
deuteronomistic
scheme
of
the
book
of
judges
there
may
be
a
question
whether
it
presupposes
the
deuteronomic
law
only
or
the
priestly
law
as
well
its
language
has
most
points
of
contact
with
deuteronomy
but
one
extremely
important
expression
and
notion
that
of
the
congregation
of
the
children
of
israel
points
rather
to
the
priestly
code
the
same
may
be
said
of
phinehas
ben
eleazar
ben
aaron
xx
the
latter
however
occurs
but
once
and
that
in
a
gloss
which
forms
a
very
awkward
interruption
between
and
the
children
of
israel
inquired
of
jehovah
and
the
word
saying
which
belongs
to
that
phrase
we
have
also
to
remark
that
there
is
no
mention
of
the
tabernacle
for
which
there
is
no
room
in
addition
to
mizpeh
so
that
the
principal
mark
of
the
priestly
code
is
wanting
it
is
only
in
preparation
it
has
not
yet
appeared
we
are
still
standing
on
the
ground
of
deuteronomy
but
the
way
is
being
prepared
for
the
transition
going
a
step
further
back
from
the
last
revision
we
meet
with
an
earlier
effort
in
the
same
direction
which
however
is
less
systematically
worked
out
in
certain
supplements
and
emendations
which
have
here
and
there
been
patched
on
to
the
original
narratives
these
may
be
due
in
part
to
the
mere
love
of
amplification
or
of
talking
for
talking
sake
and
in
so
far
we
have
no
further
business
with
them
here
but
they
originated
partly
in
the
difficulty
felt
by
a
later
age
in
sympathising
with
the
religious
usages
and
ideas
of
older
times
two
instances
of
this
kind
occur
in
the
history
of
gideon
we
read
vi
that
in
the
night
after
his
call
gideon
destroyed
at
the
commandment
of
jehovah
the
altar
of
baal
in
ophra
his
native
town
as
well
as
the
ashera
which
stood
beside
it
and
that
in
place
of
it
he
built
an
altar
to
jehovah
and
burned
on
it
a
yearling
bullock
with
the
wood
of
the
ashera
for
fuel
the
next
morning
the
people
of
ophra
were
full
of
indignation
and
demanded
that
the
author
of
the
outrage
should
be
given
up
to
them
to
be
put
to
death
his
father
however
withstood
them
saying
will
ye
contend
for
baal
will
ye
save
him
if
he
be
a
god
let
baal
contend
heb
jareb
baal
for
himself
in
consequence
of
this
speech
gideon
received
his
second
name
of
jerubbaal
this
conflicts
with
what
is
said
in
an
earlier
part
of
the
chapter
there
gideon
has
already
made
an
altar
of
the
great
stone
under
the
oak
of
ophra
where
he
saw
jehovah
sitting
and
has
offered
upon
it
the
first
sacrifice
which
was
devoured
by
flames
breaking
out
of
themselves
the
deity
himself
ascending
in
the
flames
to
heaven
why
the
two
altars
and
the
two
stories
of
their
inauguration
both
tracing
their
origin
to
the
patron
of
ophra
they
do
not
agree
together
and
the
reason
is
plain
why
the
second
was
added
the
altar
of
a
single
stone
the
flames
bursting
out
of
it
the
evergreen
tree
the
very
name
of
which
ela
seems
to
indicate
a
natural
connection
with
el
all
this
was
in
the
eyes
of
a
later
lh
lwn
in
aramaic
simply
tree
in
hebrew
the
evergreen
and
in
general
the
holy
tree
isaiah
i
seq
mostly
without
distinguishing
the
species
not
only
are
oaks
and
terebinths
included
but
also
palms
for
the
lwn
dbwrh
at
bethel
is
elsewhere
called
tmr
elim
derives
its
names
from
the
palms
and
the
same
may
be
the
case
with
elath
on
the
red
sea
generation
far
from
correct
indeed
it
was
a
desire
that
the
piety
of
gideon
should
be
above
suspicion
gave
rise
to
the
second
story
in
which
he
erects
an
altar
of
jehovah
in
place
of
the
former
altar
of
baal
how
far
this
desire
attained
its
end
we
may
best
judge
from
the
kindred
effort
to
remove
another
ground
of
offence
which
lies
in
the
name
jerubbaal
in
accordance
with
the
occasion
out
of
which
the
name
is
said
to
have
arisen
it
is
said
to
mean
let
baal
contend
etymologically
this
derivation
is
extremely
and
from
every
point
of
view
impossible
the
name
of
a
god
is
only
assumed
by
those
who
are
his
worshippers
in
hebrew
antiquity
baal
and
el
are
interchangeable
and
used
indifferently
jehovah
himself
is
spoken
of
up
to
the
times
of
the
prophet
hosea
as
the
baal
the
lord
this
is
distinctly
proved
by
a
series
of
proper
names
in
the
families
of
saul
and
david
ishbaal
meribaal
baaljada
to
which
we
may
now
add
the
name
jerubbaal
given
to
the
conqueror
of
midian
if
then
even
in
the
time
of
the
kings
baal
was
by
no
means
simply
the
antipode
of
jehovah
whence
the
hostile
relation
of
the
two
deities
which
jerubbaal
displays
by
the
acts
he
does
although
he
praises
the
great
baal
by
wearing
his
name
the
view
also
that
the
ashera
was
incompatible
with
the
worship
of
jehovah
does
not
agree
with
the
belief
of
the
earlier
age
according
to
deuteronomy
xvi
these
artificial
trees
must
have
stood
often
enough
beside
the
altars
of
jehovah
the
inserted
passage
itself
betrays
in
a
remarkable
manner
that
its
writer
felt
this
sort
of
zeal
for
the
legitimate
worship
to
be
above
the
level
of
the
age
in
question
we
receive
the
impression
that
the
inhabitants
of
ophra
do
not
know
their
worship
of
baal
to
be
illegitimate
that
gideon
also
had
taken
part
in
it
in
good
faith
and
that
there
had
never
been
an
altar
of
jehovah
in
the
place
before
of
a
somewhat
different
form
is
a
correction
which
is
to
be
found
at
the
close
of
the
history
of
gideon
viii
after
the
victory
over
the
midianites
the
israelites
are
said
to
have
asked
gideon
to
be
king
over
them
this
he
declined
out
of
regard
to
jehovah
the
sole
ruler
of
israel
but
he
asked
for
the
gold
which
had
been
taken
from
the
enemy
and
made
of
them
an
image
of
jehovah
an
ephod
which
he
set
up
in
ophra
to
be
worshipped
and
all
israel
went
thither
after
it
and
it
became
a
snare
to
gideon
and
to
his
house
now
the
way
in
which
such
a
man
acts
in
such
a
moment
is
good
authority
for
the
state
of
the
worship
of
israel
at
the
time
and
not
only
so
but
we
can
not
impute
it
to
the
original
narrator
that
he
chose
to
represent
his
hero
as
showing
his
thankfulness
to
the
deity
by
the
most
gratuitous
declension
from
his
worship
as
in
fact
crowning
his
victory
with
an
act
of
idolatry
this
is
seen
to
be
the
more
impossible
when
we
consider
that
according
to
the
testimony
of
hosea
isaiah
and
micah
such
images
were
even
in
the
assyrian
period
a
regular
part
of
the
belongings
of
the
houses
of
god
not
only
in
samaria
but
in
judah
as
well
we
have
also
to
remember
that
the
contradiction
between
a
human
kingship
and
the
kingship
of
jehovah
such
as
is
spoken
of
in
these
verses
rests
upon
theories
which
arose
later
and
of
which
we
shall
have
more
to
say
studer
will
thus
be
correct
in
his
assertion
that
the
the
words
of
gideon
are
only
intelligible
on
the
presupposition
that
the
rule
of
jehovah
had
a
visible
representative
prophet
or
priest
but
this
was
not
the
case
in
the
period
of
the
judges
as
gideon
own
history
shows
us
vatke
we
see
besides
from
ix
seq
that
gideon
really
was
the
ruler
of
ephraim
and
manasseh
old
tradition
could
not
see
anything
in
gideon
refusing
the
gold
for
himself
and
dedicating
it
to
god
but
a
fine
proof
of
his
unselfishness
and
piety
and
that
in
viii
we
have
a
secondary
product
in
which
the
original
features
of
the
story
are
distorted
so
as
to
make
them
suit
later
tastes
the
second
hand
has
unfortunately
supplanted
in
this
instance
the
work
of
the
first
the
older
narrative
breaks
off
viii
with
the
words
gideon
took
away
the
ornaments
that
were
on
the
necks
of
the
camels
of
the
kings
what
he
did
with
them
we
do
not
learn
but
naturally
we
must
suppose
that
it
was
of
them
that
he
made
the
ephod
according
to
the
secondary
passage
which
begins
immediately
after
viii
he
used
for
this
purpose
the
which
the
whole
of
israel
had
taken
from
all
the
midianites
amounting
in
weight
to
shekels
besides
the
ornaments
of
the
kings
and
of
their
camels
the
proportion
is
similar
to
that
between
the
danites
in
chap
xviii
and
the
benjamites
in
chap
or
between
the
men
of
israel
in
and
the
in
xx
in
the
last
place
it
is
possible
to
trace
even
in
the
original
narratives
themselves
certain
differences
of
religious
attitude
which
indicate
to
us
unobtrusively
and
yet
clearly
that
tendency
in
the
development
of
the
tradition
which
reached
its
end
in
the
revision
and
ornamentation
of
which
we
have
hitherto
been
speaking
this
is
especially
the
case
with
regard
to
those
narratives
which
are
preserved
to
us
in
a
double
form
these
are
not
frequent
in
judges
but
they
do
occur
a
very
simple
case
of
the
kind
is
seen
on
comparing
chap
iv
with
chap
the
canaanites
again
lift
their
heads
under
their
great
king
sisera
and
from
their
towns
in
the
plains
harass
the
hill

of
the
new
settlers
deborah

the
hebrew

eyes

such
are
the
contents
of
the
song
in
chap
in
the
preceding
narrative
chap
iv
we
should
expect
to
find
a
historical
commentary
on
the
song
but
we
find
a
mere
reproduction
in
which
the
special
features
of
the
story
are
blurred
and
falsified
instead
of
the
kings
of
canaan
we
have
the
king
of
canaan
as
if
canaan
had
been
a
kingdom
sisera
the
head
of
the
canaanite

is
transformed
into
a
mere
general

when
he
is
iying
in
a
deep
sleep
by
driving
a
into
the
ground
through
his
temples
there
is
nothing
of
this
in
the
song
there
he
is
drinking
when
she
strikes
the
blow
and
is
conceived
as
standing
at
the
time
else
he
could
not
bow
down
at

feet
and
fall
and
lie
struck
dead
where
he
fell

in
the
song
the
campaign
is
prepared
with
human
means
negotiations
are
carried
on
among
the
tribes
and
in
the
course
of
these
differences
crop
up
the
lukewarmness
or
the
swelling
words
of
some
tribes

reproved
the
energetic
public
spirit
and
warlike
courage
of
others
praised
in
the
narrative
on
the
contrary
the
deliverance
is
the
work
of
jehovah
alone
the
men
of
israel
are
mere
dummies
who
show
no
merit
and
deserve
no
praise
to
make
up
for
this
interest
is
concentrated
on
the
act
of
jael
which
instead
of
being
an
episode
becomes
the
central
point
of
the
whole
narrative
indeed
it
is
announced
as
being
so
for
deborah
prophesies
to
barak
that
the
glory
of
the
conflict
will
not
be
his
but
a
woman
into
whose
hand
the
enemy
is
to
be
sold
it
is
not
the
hero
not
human
strength
that
accomplishes
what
is
done
jehovah
shows
his
strength
in
man
weakness
and
barak
part
in
the
work
is
depreciated
in
yet
another
way
deborah
summons
him
to
go
not
to
the
battle
but
to
the
holy
hill
of
tabor
where
jehovah
will
bring
about
what
is
further
to
happen
he
however
objects
to
this
and
insists
that
the
prophetess
herself
shall
go
with
him
this
is
regarded
as
a
caprice
of
unbelief
because
the
prophetess
is
thought
to
have
exhausted
her
mission
when
she
transmitted
the
command
of
the
deity
to
his
instrument
she
has
appeared
for
no
end
but
to
make
it
known
through
her
prophecy
that
jehovah
alone
brings
everything
to
pass
in
the
song
this
is
different
there
barak
is
not
summoned
against
his
will
on
the
contrary
he
has
a
personal
motive
for
taking
up
arms
arise
barak
take
captive
thy
captors
thou
son
of
ahinoam
and
the
prophetess
has
not
only
to
prophesy
she
works
in
a
more
psychological
manner
she
is
part
of
the
battle
and
inflames
with
her
song
the
courage
of
the
fighting
battalions
awake
deborah
awake
sing
the
song
throughout
these
variations
of
ver
is
a
summons
to
begin
the
battle
and
deborah
can
not
here
be
singing
the
song
of
triumph
which
celebrates
its
happy
issue
for
a
similar
reason
the
translation
given
above
take
captive
thy
captors
is
the
more
natural
and
correct
the
prose
reproduction
we
feel
that
the
rich
colour
of
the
events
as
they
occurred
is
bleached
out
of
them
by
the
one
universal
first
cause
jehovah
the
presence
and
energy
of
jehovah
are
not
wanting
in
the
song
they
are
felt
in
the
enthusiasm
which
fills
the
hebrew
warriors
and
in
the
terror
and
panic
which
confound
the
prancing
vigour
of
the
foe
but
in
the
prose
narrative
the
divine
action
is
stripped
of
all
mystery
and
mechanic
prophecy
finds
no
difficulty
in
showing
distinctly
and
with
sober
accuracy
what
the
part
of
the
deity
in
the
history
has
been
but
the
more
special
the
intervention
of
deity
the
further
is
it
from
us
the
more
precise
the
statements
about
it
the
less
do
we
feel
it
to
be
there
there
is
another
instance
in
the
book
of
judges
of
the
occurrence
of
the
same
historical
material
in
two
different
forms
it
is
the
story
of
gideon
of
the
manassite
house
of
abiezer
studer
saw
that
there
is
a
break
between
viii
and
viii
and
that
the
two
stories
from
the
one
of
which
we
pass
to
the
other
at
that
point
have
to
be
understood
separately
viii
is
the
conclusion
of
the
first
story
we
have
been
told
how
after
the
success
of
the
first
attack
on
the
midianites
gideon
raised
the
levy
of
all
israel
for
the
pursuit
and
how
then
the
ephraimites
seized
the
fords
of
the
jordan
before
the
arrival
of
the
flying
nomads
and
got
the
two
leaders
of
the
midianites
into
their
hands
now
we
hear
in
conclusion
that
the
ephraimites
elated
by
their
success
began
to
find
fault
with
gideon
but
that
he
pacified
their
wrath
by
saying
what
have
i
done
now
in
comparison
of
you
is
not
the
gleaning
of
the
grapes
of
ephraim
better
than
the
vintage
of
abiezer
god
hath
delivered
into
your
hand
the
princes
of
midian
and
what
was
i
able
to
do
in
comparison
of
you
a
domestic
contention
like
this
about
the
respective
shares
in
the
victory
could
only
arise
when
the
victory
had
been
gained
when
the
strife
with
the
enemy
was
fought
out
the
metaphor
of
harvest
and
gleaning
shows
that
the
victory
was
complete
and
all
the
fruits
of
it
gathered
in
chapter
viii
concludes
the
business
and
the
following
narrative
is
not
a
continuation
of
what
has
gone
before
but
a
second
version
of
the
story
in
which
many
of
the
circumstances
are
quite
different
according
to
vii
seq
there
was
a
great
army
on
foot
but
in
viii
seq
gideon
has
only
his
own
three
hundred
men
with
him
in
viii
the
vintage
and
the
gleaning
are
over
and
the
object
of
the
fighting
is
attained
but
in
viii
seq
gideon
pursues
the
enemy
without
any
interruption
and
when
he
asks
the
men
of
succoth
and
penuel
for
bread
for
his
wearied
and
hungry
troops
they
inquire
sarcastically
whether
he
is
already
certain
of
success
so
that
it
should
be
necessary
for
them
to
espouse
his
cause
the
two
chiefs
who
in
the
former
account
are
called
the
princes
oreb
and
zeeb
and
are
already
taken
are
here
called
the
kings
zebah
and
zalmunna
and
are
not
taken
yet
unfortunately
the
beginning
of
viii
seq
is
not
preserved
and
we
can
not
make
out
whether
the
pursuit
in
which
we
find
gideon
here
engaged
was
preceded
by
an
action
such
a
supposition
is
not
exactly
impossible
yet
the
distance
to
which
the
nomads
had
carried
their
booty
and
their
carelessness
in
camp
make
it
more
likely
that
the
occurrence
was
like
that
in
xxx
this
however
makes
no
difference
as
to
the
particulars
with
regard
to
which
the
two
narratives
conflict
with
each
other
but
how
did
the
difference
arise
this
we
shall
best
learn
by
comparing
the
beginnings
of
the
two
stories
we
remarked
that
the
second
as
it
stands
wanted
a
beginning
but
what
is
wanting
may
be
to
some
extent
supplied
from
what
follows
according
to
viii
gideon
aim
is
to
get
hold
of
the
two
kings
of
the
midianites
these
appear
all
through
as
the
particular
enemies
whom
he
is
pursuing
as
to
the
rest
of
the
midianites
he
is
more
or
less
indifferent
and
the
reason
as
we
learn
from
viii
is
that
the
two
kings
had
slain
his
brothers
at
tabor
it
is
to
take
vengeance
for
them
that
he
sets
out
to
pursue
the
slayers
and
does
not
rest
till
they
are
in
his
hand
it
is
the
duty
of
which
causes
him
to
take
the
with
his
household
unconcerned
by
the
disproportion
in
numbers
between
his
followers
and
theirs
it
is
the
powerful
sentiment
of
family
which
sets
him
in
motion
and
causes
him
to
become
as
it
were
incidentally
the
liberator
of
israel
from
the
spoilers
in
the
first
account
vi
these
natural
motives
have
completely
disappeared
and
others
have
taken
their
place
which
are
almost
of
an
opposite
character
before
anything
has
happened
before
the
midianites
have
made
their
yearly
incursion
gideon
who
expects
nothing
of
the
kind
is
summoned
by
a
theophany
to
battle
against
them
when
they
arrive
he
is
seized
by
the
spirit
and
sets
out
against
them
what
is
human
in
him
has
no
part
in
the
act
he
is
called
to
do
flesh
and
blood
set
themselves
against
it
he
is
impelled
by
the
direct
impulse
of
jehovah
and
here
of
course
he
goes
forth
in
behalf
of
the
public
interests
of
israel
against
the
midianites
not
against
their
princes
personally
and
accordingly
everything
possible
is
done
to
cast
the
man
into
the
shade
behind
the
deity
gideon
according
to
the
second
account
a
distinguished
and
royal
man
is
in
the
first
of
a
poor
house
and
family
in
the
second
story
he
is
remarkable
for
irrepressible
energy
but
here
he
is
timid
and
shrinking
up
to
the
last
moment
and
new
miracles
have
constantly
to
be
wrought
to
encourage
and
strengthen
him
the
men
with
whom
he
takes
the
field
he
is
ordered
by
jehovah
to
send
away
all
but
and
again
all
but
lest
israel
vaunt
themselves
against
me
and
say
mine
own
hand
hath
saved
me
the
weapons
with
which
the
nocturnal
attack
of
the
is
made
are
torches
pitchers
and
trumpets
the
men
have
not
a
hand
left
to
hold
swords
vii
and
the
hostile
army
has
accordingly
to
do
itself
the
work
of
its
own
destruction
vii
few
of
the
deviations
of
the
religious
version
from
the
natural
one
are
not
transparent
one
of
these
few
is
the
removal
of
the
scene
to
this
side
of
the
jordan
most
of
them
are
at
once
recognisable
as
due
to
the
process
of
glorification
illumination
and
religious
inflation
by
which
the
body
of
the
tradition
is
etherealised
and
the
story
lifted
up
into
the
region
of
the
air
for
example
the
company
of
gideon
at
the
main
action
the
attack
on
the
hostile
camp
consists
of
men
in
chap
vii
as
well
as
in
chap
viii
but
in
chap
to
draw
out
the
significance
of
the
small
number
they
are
treated
as
the
last
residuum
of
what
was
at
first
quite
a
considerable
army
and
this
gives
rise
to
a
long
story
we
may
also
remark
that
chap
vi
begins
with
the
relation
in
which
the
judge
stood
to
the
sanctuary
of
his
native
town
while
chap
viii
closes
with
this
in
the
one
case
he
discovers
by
a
theophany
like
the
patriarchs
in
genesis
the
sacredness
of
the
under
the
oak
in
the
other
he
sets
up
in
far
more
realistic
fashion
the
plated
image
ephod
he
has
made
of
the
golden
ornaments
of
the
midianite
kings
history
has
to
take
account
principally
if
not
exclusively
of
the
natural
version
which
is
dry
in
tone
and
lets
things
speak
for
themselves
not
overlaying
the
simple
story
with
the
significance
of
its
consequences
the
relation
however
is
somewhat
different
from
that
which
we
found
existing
between
judges
iv
and
chapter
vi
seq
is
not
based
directly
on
chap
but
was
probably
formed
from
independent
oral
material
though
the
local
colour
is
lively
the
historical
reminiscences
are
extremely
vague
and
there
has
been
a
much
freer
growth
of
legend
than
in
jud
producing
pictures
of
greater
art
and
more
naivete
but
in
the
field
of
miracle
poetry
is
manifestly
earlier
than
prose
in
the
case
of
those
narratives
which
have
come
down
to
us
in
double
form
the
difference
of
standpoint
is
unmistakable
but
it
may
also
be
perceived
in
cases
where
we
have
no
direct
parallels
to
compare
how
noticeably
does
the
story
of
abimelech
differ
say
from
that
of
jephthah
which
follows
it
in
the
rich
detail
of
its
facts
and
in
the
spontaneous
interest
it
shows
in
the
secondary
and
subordinate
links
in
the
chain
of
events
there
is
no
gilding
with
a
supernatural
nimbus
facts
are
simply
and
plainly
set
down
such
as
they
are
the
moral
is
left
to
speak
for
itself
as
the
story
goes
on
in
the
samson
legends
again
we
find
two
souls
united
as
it
were
in
one
body
traits
belonging
to
the
rough
life
and
spirit
of
the
people
are
wrought
especially
at
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
narrative
into
a
religious
national
form
yet
the
two
stand
in
an
inner
contrast
to
each
other
and
it
is
scarcely
probable
that
the
exploits
of
this
grotesque
religious
hero
were
at
first
conceived
in
the
spirit
of
jehovah
of
which
in
the
story
as
we
have
it
they
are
the
product
more
probably
the
religious
way
of
telling
the
story
was
preceded
by
a
way
considerably
more
profane
but
we
can
not
now
separate
the
older
stage
from
that
which
is
more
recent
we
may
also
remark
that
the
contrast
of
historical
and
unhistorical
is
obviously
inapplicable
to
this
case
and
moreover
is
unessential
for
the
end
we
have
in
view
only
it
may
stand
as
a
general
principle
that
the
nearer
history
is
to
its
origin
the
more
profane
it
is
in
the
narratives
the
difference
is
to
be
recognised
less
in
the
of
piety
than
in
the
of
it
the
comprehensive
revision
which
we
noticed
in
the
book
of
judges
has
left
its
mark
on
the
books
of
samuel
too
as
however
in
this
case
the
period
is
short
and
extremely
rich
in
incident
and
really
forms
a
connected
whole
the
artificial
and
does
not
make
itself
so
much
felt
yet
it
is
by
no
means
wanting
as
the
dates
of
themselves
indicate
whose
place
in
the
chronological
system
was
shown
above
it
is
worthy
of
notice
how
very
loosely
these
are
fitted
into
their
context
in
iv
seq
we
read
and
when
the
messenger
made
mention
of
the
ark
of
god
eli
fell
backwards
off
his
seat
and
his
neck
brake
and
he
died
for
he
was
an
old
man
and
heavy
and
judged
israel
forty
and
when
his
the
wife
of
phinehas
who
was
with
child
heard
the
tidings
etc
the
statement
of
the
date
is
not
altogether
inappropriately
dragged
in
indeed
yet
it
is
easy
to
see
that
it
is
dragged
in
in
ii
we
read
abner
the
captain
of
saul
host
took
ishbaal
the
son
of
saul
and
brought
him
over
the
jordan
to
mahanaim
and
made
him
king
over
gilead
and
geshur
and
jezreel
and
ephraim
and
benjamin
and
all
israel
was
forty
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
over
lsrael
and
he
reigned
two
but
the
house
of
judah
followed
david
and
the
time
that
david
was
king
in
hebron
was
seven
years
and
six
months
and
abner
and
the
servants
of
ishbaal
went
out
from
mahanaim
to
gibeon
and
joab
with
the
servants
of
david
went
out
to
meet
him
the
words
in
italics
manifestly
interrupt
the
connection
and
with
regard
to
ishbaal
dates
we
have
also
to
remark
that
from
what
we
learn
of
him
elsewhere
he
was
in
the
first
place
still
in
the
years
of
pupilage
and
in
the
next
must
have
reigned
as
long
in
mahanaim
as
oavid
in
hebron
the
number
two
connected
with
his
reign
is
to
be
explained
as
in
the
case
of
saul
xiii
was
years
old
when
he
began
to
reign
and
he
reigned
two
years
over
in
this
verse
which
is
not
found
in
the
lxx
the
number
for
the
years
of
his
life
is
wanting
and
originally
the
number
for
the
years
of
his
reign
was
left
out
too
the
is
quite
absurd
and
has
grown
out
of
the
following
word
for
year
which
in
hebrew
has
a
somewhat
similar
appearance
in
company
with
the
chronological
formulas
we
find
also
the
religious
vii
while
the
ark
abode
in
it
was
twenty
years
and
all
the
house
of
israel
came
together
after
jehovah
and
samuel
spake
unto
the
whole
house
of
israel
saying
ye
do
return
to
jehovah
with
all
your
hearts
then
put
away
the
strange
gods
and
the
astartes
from
among
you
and
prepare
your
hearts
unto
jehovah
and
serve
him
only
and
he
will
deliver
you
out
of
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
the
children
of
israel
did
put
away
the
baals
and
astartes
and
served
jehovah
only
we
are
not
told
in
what
precedes
this
passage
of
any
act
of
declension
from
jehovah
and
according
to
chap
iv
the
israelites
showed
no
want
of
faith
in
jehovah
in
the
unfortunate
battle
with
the
philistines
this
taking
for
granted
that
the
yoke
of
a
foreign
rule
was
laid
on
them
as
a
punishment
for
their
sins
is
characteristic
a
further
example
occurs
in
the
speech
of
samuel
xii
which
as
the
introduction
to
the
time
of
the
kings
may
be
compared
with
judges
the
introduction
to
the
time
of
the
judges
stand
still
that
i
may
reason
with
you
before
jehovah
of
all
the
righteous
acts
of
jehovah
with
which
he
did
right
to
you
and
to
your
fathers
when
jacob
was
come
into
egypt
your
fathers
cried
to
jehovah
and
he
sent
moses
and
aaron
and
brought
your
fathers
out
of
egypt
and
made
them
dwell
in
this
land
and
when
they
forget
jehovah
their
god
he
sold
them
into
the
hand
of
sisera
captain
of
the
host
of
hazor
and
into
the
hand
of
the
philistines
and
the
moabites
and
they
fought
against
them
and
they
cried
unto
jehovah
and
said
we
have
sinned
because
we
have
forsaken
jehovah
and
have
served
baal
and
astarte
but
now
deliver
us
out
of
the
hand
of
our
enemies
and
we
will
serve
thee
and
jehovah
sent
jerubbaal
and
barak
and
jephthah
and
samuel
and
delivered
you
out
of
the
hand
of
your
enemies
on
every
side
and
ye
dwelled
safe
and
when
ye
saw
that
nahash
the
king
of
the
children
of
ammon
came
against
you
ye
said
unto
me
nay
but
a
king
shall
reign
over
us
when
jehovah
your
god
is
your
king
now
therefore
behold
the
king
whom
ye
have
desired
behold
jehovah
has
set
a
king
over
you
if
ye
will
hear
jehovah
and
serve
him
and
obey
his
voice
and
not
rebel
against
the
commandment
of
jehovah
good
but
if
ye
rebel
against
the
commandment
of
jehovah
then
shall
the
hand
of
jehovah
be
against
you
as
it
was
against
your
fathers
it
is
the
familiar
strain
rebellion
affliction
conversion
peace
jehovah
the
keynote
and
the
first
word
and
the
last
the
eye
does
not
dwell
on
the
details
of
the
story
the
gaps
in
the
tradition
are
turned
to
account
as
well
as
its
contents
which
are
concentrated
at
so
few
points
details
are
regarded
only
as
they
bear
on
the
whole
the
periods
are
passed
in
review
in
a
broad
and
general
style
and
the
law
enunciated
which
connects
them
with
one
another
in
doing
this
samuel
seems
to
presuppose
in
his
hearers
a
knowledge
of
the
biblical
history
in
a
distinct
form
and
he
even
speaks
without
hesitation
of
his
own
historical
significance
the
hearers
are
bidden
to
look
back
upon
a
period
in
the
living
movement
of
which
they
themselves
are
standing
as
if
it
were
a
dead
past
as
they
are
thus
lifted
up
to
the
height
of
an
objective
contemplation
of
themselves
and
their
fathers
in
the
end
the
result
which
was
to
be
expected
takes
place
they
become
conscious
of
their
grievous
sin
confronted
with
the
deity
they
have
always
an
uneasy
feeling
that
they
deserve
to
be
punished
the
deuteronomist
revision
asserts
itself
it
is
true
only
in
these
two
places
or
rather
this
one
place
but
this
is
the
principal
epoch
in
the
book
the
transition
to
the
monarchy
which
is
associated
with
the
name
of
samuel
and
on
this
account
the
revision
here
acts
the
more
trenchantly
it
is
not
only
an
addition
to
give
a
new
flavour
to
the
older
tradition
it
changes
the
nature
of
the
tradition
entirely
for
the
passages
we
have
just
quoted
from
it
are
merely
fragments
of
a
considerable
connected
historical
scheme
the
first
piece
of
this
scheme
vii
first
claims
our
attention
after
summoning
the
children
of
israel
to
repentance
vii
samuel
convokes
an
assembly
of
them
at
mizpeh
near
jerusalem
in
order
to
entreat
for
them
that
the
philistine
affliction
may
be
turned
away
this
measure
is
of
course
closely
connected
with
the
abolition
of
idolatry
for
after
the
guilt
has
ceased
the
punishment
also
must
be
removed
they
assemble
draw
water
to
pour
it
out
before
jehovah
fast
and
confess
their
sins
at
mizpeh
when
tbe
philistines
hear
this
they
are
on
the
spot
the
very
same
day
and
fall
upon
the
assembly
at
its
prayers
samuel
however
sacrifices
a
sucking
lamb
and
cries
for
help
to
jehovah
and
the
engagement
takes
place
while
he
is
so
occupied
jehovah
thunders
terribly
against
the
philistines
and
throws
them
into
disorder
so
that
they
are
forced
to
yield
and
are
pursued
to
a
great
distance
and
the
philistines
this
is
the
end
of
the
narrative
were
humbled
and
came
no
more
into
the
coasts
of
israel
and
the
hand
of
jehovah
was
against
the
philistines
all
the
days
of
samuel
and
the
cities
which
the
philistines
had
taken
from
israel
were
recovered
ekron
and
gath
and
their
coasts
did
israel
take
from
the
philistines
and
there
was
peace
between
israel
and
the
amorites
the
mere
recapitulation
of
the
contents
of
this
narrative
makes
us
feel
at
once
what
a
pious
it
is
and
how
full
of
inherent
impossibilities
to
think
of
all
that
is
compressed
into
the
space
of
this
one
day
but
we
have
also
to
remark
the
utter
contradiction
of
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
the
tradition
in
the
history
which
follows
we
find
the
domination
of
the
philistines
by
no
means
at
an
end
not
only
do
they
invade
the
israelite
territory
several
times
in
samuel
lifetime
they
are
in
possession
of
the
land
of
lsrael
and
one
of
their
governors
lives
at
gibeah
in
the
midst
of
benjamin
the
struggle
with
them
is
the
true
and
real
origin
and
task
of
the
monarchy
the
writer
had
no
idea
that
samuel
had
discharged
this
labour
and
won
this
victory
already
and
had
even
restored
ekron
and
gath
on
the
contrary
the
yoke
of
the
philistines
lay
most
heavily
on
israel
just
in
his
days
there
can
not
be
a
word
of
truth
in
the
whole
narrative
its
motives
however
are
easily
seen
samuel
is
a
saint
of
the
first
degree
jeremiah
xv
and
in
the
theocracy
in
the
religious
community
such
as
ancient
israel
is
represented
to
have
been
cut
to
the
pattern
of
judaism
such
a
man
must
take
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
whole
his
influence
must
have
prevailed
to
exclude
idolatry
and
unfaithfulness
to
jehovah
on
the
part
of
the
people
and
the
general
character
of
the
time
must
on
the
whole
have
answered
to
the
type
he
set
before
it
but
here
a
very
unpleasant
difficulty
suggests
itself
if
the
fact
of
samuel
being
at
the
head
is
sufficient
guarantee
that
all
was
as
it
should
be
within
the
state
how
can
there
have
been
such
great
pressure
externally
so
as
to
endanger
the
very
existence
of
the
people
if
men
do
their
part
how
can
jehovah
fail
to
do
his
on
the
contrary
it
must
be
believed
that
the
righteousness
which
prevailed
within
had
its
counterpart
in
the
external
vindication
of
his
people
by
jehovah
even
under
samuel
the
philistines
were
with
god
help
driven
across
the
border
and
as
long
as
he
lived
they
were
not
seen
within
it
again
the
piety
of
a
praying
assembly
was
suitably
acknowledged
by
jehovah
who
dropped
into
its
lap
a
success
such
as
in
after
times
the
sword
of
warlike
kings
sought
long
and
in
vain
to
achieve
but
this
example
of
history
corrected
does
not
stand
alone
and
becomes
completely
intelligible
only
when
taken
in
connection
with
the
similar
pieces
which
belong
to
it
vii
is
continued
in
chap
and
chap
viii
again
in
x
samuel
after
setting
the
land
free
from
foreign
tyranny
conducts
a
quiet
and
successful
reign
till
old
age
comes
upon
him
his
sons
however
whom
he
has
made
his
assessors
do
not
walk
in
his
steps
and
the
elders
of
israel
make
this
the
occasion
to
ask
him
to
give
them
a
king
but
this
is
a
mere
pretext
for
their
sinful
desire
to
shake
off
the
divine
rule
and
to
be
like
the
heathen
round
about
them
samuel
is
extremely
indignant
at
their
ingratitude
but
is
directed
by
jehovah
to
comply
with
their
request
they
have
not
rejected
thee
but
they
have
rejected
me
that
i
should
not
reign
over
them
according
to
all
the
works
that
they
have
done
since
the
day
that
i
brought
them
up
out
of
egypt
wherewith
they
have
forsaken
me
and
served
other
gods
so
do
they
also
unto
thee
it
is
in
vain
that
samuel
exhibits
to
them
an
alarming
catalogue
of
the
rights
of
the
king
they
are
not
to
be
moved
from
their
determination
and
he
accordingly
summons
a
general
convention
of
the
people
at
mizpeh
viii
x
there
after
the
opening
lecture
lots
are
drawn
for
the
king
and
saul
is
chosen
whereupon
samuel
has
still
to
write
down
the
law
of
the
kingdom
and
lay
it
up
before
jehovah
the
people
are
then
dismissed
and
saul
also
went
home
to
gibeah
and
with
him
the
warriors
whose
heart
god
had
touched
but
the
children
of
belial
despised
him
and
said
shall
this
man
save
us
but
saul
is
at
this
point
only
king
he
does
not
become
king
until
after
he
has
proved
himself
chap
xi
after
an
interval
of
a
month
x
lxx
the
men
of
jabesh
besieged
by
the
ammonites
and
in
great
straits
send
messengers
throughout
israel
to
implore
speedy
assistance
since
in
seven
days
they
have
to
surrender
to
their
enemies
and
each
of
them
to
lose
his
right
eye
the
messengers
come
to
the
town
of
saul
gibeah
in
benjamin
and
tell
their
message
before
the
people
the
people
lift
up
their
voices
and
weep
saul
meanwhile
comes
from
the
field
with
a
yoke
of
oxen
and
observing
the
general
weeping
asks
what
has
happened
the
story
is
told
him
and
at
once
the
spirit
of
god
comes
upon
him
and
his
anger
is
kindled
greatly
he
hews
in
pieces
his
oxen
and
sends
the
pieces
throughout
israel
with
the
summons
whoever
does
not
come
forth
to
the
battle
so
shall
it
be
done
to
his
oxen
and
the
fear
of
jehovah
falls
on
the
people
and
they
go
out
as
one
man
and
relieve
the
besieged
town
hereupon
the
kingdom
is
renewed
for
saul
at
gilgal
and
only
now
does
samuel
abdicate
his
government
in
the
long
speech
chap
xii
a
considerable
portion
of
which
was
given
above
that
chap
xi
is
now
an
integral
part
of
this
version
of
the
history
is
clear
from
xii
and
also
from
xi
but
it
was
not
originally
designed
for
this
connection
for
we
hear
nothing
of
the
warriors
who
according
to
x
were
in
company
with
saul
it
is
not
on
his
account
that
the
messengers
of
jabesh
came
to
gibeah
when
the
supposed
king
comes
home
from
ploughing
nothing
is
done
to
indicate
that
the
news
concerns
him
specially
no
one
tells
him
what
has
happened
he
has
to
ask
the
reason
of
the
general
weeping
he
summons
the
levy
of
israel
not
in
virtue
of
his
office
as
king
but
in
the
authority
of
the
spirit
and
it
is
owing
to
the
spirit
acting
on
the
people
that
he
is
obeyed
only
after
he
has
showed
his
power
and
defeated
the
ammonites
do
the
people
make
him
king
xi
the
renewal
of
the
kingdom
xi
after
a
month
interval
is
a
transparent
artifice
of
the
author
of
viii
seq
to
incorporate
in
his
own
narrative
the
piece
which
he
had
borrowed
from
some
other
quarter
the
verses
xi
are
due
to
him
chapter
xi
stood
originally
in
connection
with
the
other
narrative
of
the
elevation
of
saul
ix
hero
saul
first
appears
engaged
in
searching
for
strayed
after
a
vain
search
of
several
days
he
arrives
in
the
neighbourhood
of
ramah
and
at
the
suggestion
of
his
servant
applies
for
information
as
to
the
asses
to
a
seer
there
to
samuel
his
approach
has
been
announced
to
the
seer
by
jehovah
the
day
before
i
will
send
to
thee
a
man
out
of
the
land
of
benjamin
and
thou
shalt
anoint
him
to
be
ruler
over
my
people
israel
he
shall
save
them
from
the
philistines
he
was
accordingly
expecting
him
and
had
instituted
a
sacrificial
feast
on
the
bamah
for
him
even
before
he
arrived
at
this
moment
samuel
has
gone
down
to
the
town
between
the
sacrificial
act
and
the
meal
which
followed
it
and
just
as
he
is
going
back
to
his
guests
he
meets
in
the
gate
saul
who
is
asking
for
him
and
at
a
whisper
from
jehovah
he
recognises
in
him
his
man
he
takes
him
up
with
him
to
the
bamah
reassures
him
about
the
asses
and
then
at
once
tells
him
to
what
high
things
he
is
called
and
gives
him
convincing
proofs
that
he
had
reckoned
on
his
presence
at
the
feast
as
the
guest
of
the
occasion
he
then
gives
him
lodgings
for
the
night
and
accompanies
him
on
his
way
next
morning
the
servant
is
sent
on
a
little
way
before
samuel
stands
still
and
anoints
saul
for
a
sign
that
he
is
chosen
by
jehovah
to
be
the
king
and
deliverer
of
israel
and
in
conclusion
instructs
him
that
when
the
opportunity
for
action
comes
he
is
to
use
it
in
the
consciousness
that
god
is
with
him
on
his
way
home
three
signs
come
to
pass
which
the
seer
had
announced
to
him
he
is
thus
assured
that
all
that
was
said
to
him
was
true
his
heart
is
changed
by
degrees
till
he
can
not
contain
himself
on
his
arrival
at
gibeah
his
acquaintances
are
struck
with
his
strange
demeanour
but
he
does
not
disclose
even
to
his
most
intimate
friend
at
home
what
samuel
had
said
to
him
but
waits
for
the
things
that
shall
come
to
pass
this
is
the
point
arrived
at
in
x
it
is
clear
that
thus
far
no
conclusion
has
yet
been
reached
the
seed
that
is
sown
must
spring
up
the
changed
spirit
must
produce
its
effects
and
this
requirement
is
abundantly
satisfied
if
chap
xi
is
regarded
as
immediately
continuing
the
story
from
x
after
about
a
month
the
opportunity
presents
itself
for
saul
to
act
which
samuel
had
bidden
him
to
look
for
while
others
are
weeping
at
the
disgrace
which
threatens
an
israelite
town
at
the
hands
of
the
ammonites
he
is
filled
with
the
spirit
and
with
rage
the
arrow
is
still
in
his
heart
from
that
conversation
and
he
now
does
what
his
hand
finds
to
do
the
result
is
a
great
success
the
word
of
the
seer
finds
its
fulfilment
in
the
most
natural
way
in
the
world
if
chap
xi
belongs
originally
to
the
narrative
of
ix
it
follows
at
once
that
the
other
sections
are
dependent
and
later
but
what
is
the
inner
relation
of
the
one
version
to
the
other
they
coincide
in
their
ideas
here
and
there
in
the
one
story
saul
seeks
the
asses
and
finds
the
crown
in
the
other
he
hides
himself
among
the
stuff
and
is
drawn
forth
king
in
the
one
he
is
called
by
the
seer
in
the
other
he
is
chosen
by
lot
the
divine
causality
operative
in
both
cases
but
how
the
idea
is
exaggerated
at
the
later
stage
and
how
nakedly
it
is
put
forward
and
if
there
is
this
similarity
of
view
yet
the
deviation
of
the
secondary
version
from
the
original
is
much
more
striking
than
the
resemblance
for
its
tendency
we
are
prepared
by
chapter
vii
samuel
has
set
his
countrymen
free
from
their
enemies
and
ruled
over
them
afterwards
in
righteousness
and
prosperity
why
then
should
they
desire
a
change
in
the
form
of
government
they
have
just
as
much
and
as
little
reason
for
desiring
this
as
for
the
falling
away
from
jehovah
which
also
is
a
periodical
craving
on
their
part
whenever
they
have
had
some
years
rest
it
is
the
expression
of
the
heathenism
of
their
nature
that
is
the
account
of
chapter
viii
with
what
belongs
to
it
chapter
ix
however
gives
quite
a
different
account
here
at
the
end
of
the
period
of
the
judges
israel
is
not
at
the
summit
of
power
and
prosperity
but
in
a
state
of
the
deepest
humiliation
and
the
means
of
saving
the
people
from
this
state
is
seen
in
the
monarchy
alone
and
this
difference
is
closely
connected
with
another
as
to
the
view
taken
of
the
authority
of
samuel
in
chap
viii
as
in
chap
vii
he
is
the
vicegerent
of
jehovah
with
unlimited
authority
he
feels
the
institution
of
the
monarchy
to
be
his
own
deposition
yet
the
children
of
israel
by
no
means
rebel
against
him
they
come
to
him
to
ask
him
for
a
king
he
might
have
refused
the
request
he
might
also
have
given
them
a
ruler
according
to
his
own
good
pleasure
but
as
a
correct
theocrat
he
leaves
the
decision
to
jehovah
at
the
end
he
solemnly
lays
down
the
government
he
has
hitherto
carried
on
and
hands
it
over
to
his
successor
the
latter
is
superior
to
him
in
point
of
title
but
not
in
point
of
power
indeed
in
the
latter
respect
he
is
rather
inferior
to
samuel
being
a
mere
earthly
prince
xii
but
how
do
matters
stand
in
chap
ix
here
samuel
is
quite
a
stranger
to
saul
who
knows
neither
his
name
nor
his
residence
only
his
servant
has
heard
of
samuel
who
enjoys
a
high
reputation
as
a
seer
in
his
own
neighbourhood
what
we
are
to
think
of
when
we
read
of
a
seer
of
that
period
we
are
clearly
and
circumstantially
informed
for
samuel
is
consulted
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
strayed
and
a
fee
of
a
quarter
of
a
silver
shekel
is
tendered
to
him
for
his
advice
this
seer
stands
it
is
clear
above
the
average
of
those
who
practiced
the
same
calling
yet
his
action
on
the
history
is
quite
within
the
limits
of
what
was
possible
say
to
calchas
it
exhibits
not
a
trace
of
the
legislative
and
executive
power
of
a
regent
of
the
theocracy
he
does
not
bring
help
he
only
descries
help
and
the
helper
the
very
event
which
according
to
chap
viii
involved
the
removal
of
samuel
from
his
place
and
his
withdrawal
to
the
background
of
the
history
is
here
the
sole
basis
of
his
reputation
the
monarchy
of
saul
if
not
his
work
is
his
idea
he
announces
to
the
benjamite
his
high
calling
interpreting
in
this
the
thoughts
of
the
man
own
heart
ix
with
this
his
work
is
done
he
has
no
commission
and
no
power
to
nominate
his
successor
in
the
government
everything
else
he
leaves
to
the
course
of
events
and
to
the
spirit
of
jehovah
which
will
place
saul
on
his
own
feet
in
the
great
difference
which
separates
these
two
narratives
we
recognise
the
mental
interval
between
two
different
ages
in
the
eyes
of
israel
before
the
exile
the
monarchy
is
the
culminating
point
of
the
history
and
the
greatest
blessing
of
jehovah
it
was
preceded
by
a
period
of
unrest
and
affliction
when
every
man
did
what
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
and
the
enemies
of
israel
accordingly
got
everything
their
own
way
under
it
the
people
dwell
securely
and
respected
by
those
round
about
guarded
by
the
shelter
of
civil
order
the
citizen
can
sit
under
his
own
vine
and
his
own
that
is
the
work
of
the
first
two
kings
who
saved
israel
from
his
spoilers
and
gave
him
power
and
rest
no
difference
is
made
between
them
in
this
respect
the
one
commenced
the
work
which
the
other
completed
ix
xiv
iii
xix
before
them
there
was
no
breathing
space
left
in
the
hard
work
of
fighting
but
now
there
is
time
to
think
of
other
things
even
deuteronomy
which
was
written
not
long
before
the
exile
regards
the
period
before
the
monarchy
as
a
time
of
preparation
and
transition
not
to
be
counted
complete
in
itself
israel
must
first
acquire
fixed
seats
and
a
settled
way
of
living
and
then
jehovah
also
will
choose
a
seat
for
himself
and
make
known
his
desires
with
regard
to
the
cultus
david
brought
things
so
far
that
the
people
had
room
and
struck
firm
roots
into
the
ground
and
ceased
to
tremble
before
their
enemies
who
had
kept
them
on
the
strain
from
the
beginning
and
all
the
days
of
the
judges
and
under
his
successor
the
time
came
when
the
temple
could
be
built
and
higher
interests
receive
attention
that
hebrew
antiquity
knew
nothing
of
any
hostility
or
incompatibility
between
the
heavenly
and
the
earthly
ruler
is
plain
from
the
title
anointed
of
jehovah
and
from
the
hope
of
the
prophets
whose
ideal
future
would
be
incomplete
without
a
human
king
the
ancient
israelites
were
as
fully
conscious
as
any
other
people
of
the
gratitude
they
owed
to
the
men
and
to
the
institutions
by
whose
aid
they
had
been
lifted
out
of
anarchy
and
oppression
and
formed
into
an
orderly
community
capable
of
of
this
the
books
of
samuel
afford
the
most
eloquent
testimony
l
in
balaam
view
of
the
happy
future
of
israel
numbers
xxiii

the
monarchy
is
spoken
of
as
one
of
israel

blessings

jehovah
his
god
is
with
him
and
the
shout
of
a
king
is
among
them
with
reference
to
saul

and
his
king
triumphs
over
agag
and
his

according
to

xxxiii
the
monarchy
and
the
torah
are
the
two
great
gifts
of
god
grace
to
israel
the
position
taken
up
in
the
version
of
samuel
vii
viii
x
seq
presents
the
greatest
possible
contrast
to
this
way
of
thinking
there
the
erection
of
the
monarchy
only
forms
a
worse
stage
of
backsliding
from
jehovah
there
can
be
no
progress
beyond
the
mosaic
ideal
the
greater
the
departure
from
it
the
greater
the
declension
the
capital
sin
of
placing
a
human
ruler
on
the
throne
of
jehovah
makes
even
the
period
of
the
judges
appear
not
quite
black
dark
as
the
colours
are
with
which
that
period
is
generally
painted
it
held
fast
to
the
original
form
of
the
theocracy
and
so
appears
somewhat
brighter
at
last
indeed
to
heighten
the
contrast
it
is
represented
as
a
splendid
age
under
the
rule
of
samuel
everything
was
as
it
should
be
should
we
ask
were
things
then
what
was
exactly
the
nature
of
the
theocratic
constitution
we
receive
it
is
true
no
satisfactory
answer
to
the
question
we
might
draw
conclusions
with
regard
to
the
body
from
the
head
but
what
sort
of
an
idea
can
we
form
of
the
position
of
samuel
as
he
appears
in
these
chapters
we
entirely
fail
to
dispose
of
him
in
any
of
the
categories
applicable
to
the
subject
he
is
not
a
judge
not
a
priest
not
a
prophet
if
at
least
we
use
these
words
with
their
true
historical
meaning
he
is
a
second
moses
yes
but
that
does
not
tell
us
much
so
much
only
is
clear
that
the
theocracy
is
arranged
on
quite
a
different
footing
from
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
and
that
it
amounts
to
a
falling
away
into
heathenism
when
the
israelites
place
a
king
at
their
head
like
other
nations
and
he
keeps
courtiers
and
ministers
officers
and
soldiers
horses
and
chariots
it
is
accordingly
a
spiritual
community
the
spiritual
character
of
the
regent
places
this
beyond
doubt
samuel
admonishes
the
people
to
give
up
idolatry
he
presides
at
the
great
day
of
repentance
at
mizpeh
which
forms
an
epoch
in
the
sacred
history
and
jehovah
can
refuse
nothing
to
his
prayers
and
cries
xii
god
forbid
he
says
in
taking
leave
of
them
xii
that
i
should
cease
to
pray
for
you
and
teach
you
the
good
way
such
is
his
position
and
the
citizens
of
the
theocracy
have
the
corresponding
duty
of
cultivating
the
worship
of
jehovah
and
not
withdrawing
themselves
from
the
guidance
of
the
representative
of
deity
they
do
not
need
to
trouble
themselves
about
means
for
warding
off
the
attacks
of
their
enemies
if
they
fast
and
pray
and
give
up
their
sins
jehovah
hurls
back
the
foe
with
his
thunder
and
lightning
and
so
long
as
they
are
pious
he
will
not
allow
their
land
to
be
invaded
all
the
expenses
are
then
naturally
superfluous
by
which
a
people
usually
safeguards
it
own
existence
that
this
view
is
unhistorical
is
and
that
it
contradicts
the
genuine
tradition
we
have
seen
the
ancient
israelites
did
not
build
a
church
first
of
all
what
they
built
first
was
a
house
to
live
in
and
they
rejoiced
not
a
little
when
they
got
it
happily
roofed
over
xi
but
we
have
still
to
add
in
conclusion
that
the
idea
here
before
us
can
only
have
arisen
in
an
age
which
had
no
knowledge
of
israel
as
a
people
and
a
state
and
which
had
no
experience
of
the
real
conditions
of
existence
in
these
forms
in
other
words
it
is
the
offspring
of
exilic
or
judaism
at
that
time
the
nation
was
transformed
into
a
religious
community
whose
members
were
at
liberty
to
concentrate
themselves
on
what
they
held
to
be
the
great
business
of
life
worship
and
religiousness
because
the
chaldeans
or
the
persians
had
relieved
them
of
all
care
for
worldly
concerns
at
that
time
accordingly
the
theocracy
and
it
is
from
that
time
that
it
is
transported
in
an
idealised
form
to
early
times
the
material
basis
on
which
the
theocracy
rested
in
fact
namely
the
foreign
domination
is
put
out
of
sight
and
it
is
counted
heathenism
in
the
old
israelites
that
they
cared
for
the
external
conditions
of
their
national
existence
that
they
are
a
people
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
and
seek
to
maintain
themselves
as
such
with
the
weapons
which
are
found
necessary
in
the
world
it
naturally
never
came
into
the
heads
of
these
epigoni
to
conceive
that
the
political
organisation
and
centralisation
which
the
monarchy
called
into
being
provided
the
basis
for
the
organisation
and
centralisation
of
the
worship
and
that
their
church
was
merely
a
spiritualised
survival
of
the
nation
what
is
added
to
moses
is
taken
away
from
the
monarchy
one
more
point
has
to
be
noticed
the
chapters
vii
viii
x
seq
xii
betray
a
close
relationship
with
judges
not
only
by
their
general
tendency
but
by
a
geographical
detail
in
which
the
two
passages
agree
it
is
only
here
that
mizpeh
near
jerusalem
occurs
as
the
place
of
meeting
of
all
israel
we
find
no
further
mention
of
the
place
in
the
whole
period
of
the
judges
and
the
kings
only
after
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
is
it
mentioned
and
there
as
the
centre
of
the
new
jewish
community
instituted
by
the
chaldeans
jeremiah
xl
seq
as
the
substitute
of
the
old
capital
it
appears
once
more
and
in
a
similar
character
in
i
maccabees
iii
seq
at
a
time
when
the
temple
of
jerusalem
was
in
the
hands
of
the
syrians
and
the
jews
could
not
get
to
it
the
mizpeh
of
judges
vii
is
probably
the
same
as
that
of
jeremiah
xl
and
intended
to
be
like
these
in
place
of
jerusalem
the
only
legitimate
sanctuary
which
however
did
not
exist
at
that
early
time
this
is
a
further
proof
of
the
and
jewish
origin
of
these
narratives
but
at
the
same
time
an
indication
that
with
every
inclination
to
the
views
of
the
priestly
code
the
writer
yet
had
not
that
code
before
him
for
in
that
work
the
projection
of
jerusalem
into
the
period
before
solomon
is
carried
out
in
quite
a
different
way
the
tabernacle
renders
mizpeh
superfluous
it
has
also
to
be
remarked
that
the
rite
of
pouring
out
water
vii
is
foreign
to
the
priestly
code
the
relation
of
saul
to
samuel
is
a
subject
which
lends
itself
readily
to
general
views
and
the
development
of
the
tradition
is
visible
in
it
in
other
particulars
besides
those
we
have
mentioned
taking
the
view
of
vii
viii
xii
as
the
lower
limit
the
narrative
nearest
in
character
is
the
story
about
samuel
contained
in
an
insertion
in
chap
xiii
after
saul
is
made
king
at
gilgal
by
the
levy
with
which
he
relieved
jabesh
he
selects
from
it
a
body
of
men
who
camp
with
him
and
jonathan
at
gibeah
and
the
neighbouring
michmash
and
jonathan
by
killing
the
officer
at
gibeah
gives
the
signal
for
battle
with
the
old
enemy
of
his
race
the
philistines
advance
and
take
up
a
position
to
the
north
of
gibeah
with
only
a
deep
valley
between
them
and
the
israelites
but
saul
we
hear
all
at
once
xiii
cf
ver
was
yet
in
gilgal
and
waited
seven
days
for
samuel
according
to
the
set
time
the
latter
had
appointed
but
samuel
did
not
come
and
the
warriors
began
to
scatter
as
he
was
himself
offering
the
sacrifice
without
which
no
campaign
could
be
commenced
samuel
arrived
and
at
once
opened
upon
him
saul
defended
his
act
with
great
force
the
people
were
scattering
and
samuel
had
not
come
at
the
appointed
time
and
as
the
philistines
had
advanced
close
up
to
gibeah
he
had
found
it
impossible
to
delay
longer
and
had
offered
the
sacrifice
in
order
to
advance
against
them
to
all
this
samuel
only
answer
was
thou
hast
done
foolishly
if
thou
hadst
kept
the
commandment
of
jehovah
he
would
have
established
thy
kingdom
for
ever
but
now
thy
kingdom
shall
not
continue
jehovah
has
sought
him
a
man
after
his
own
heart
and
appointed
him
to
be
ruler
over
his
people
because
thou
hast
not
kept
that
which
jehovah
commanded
thee
so
he
said
and
walked
off
but
saul
went
with
the
army
from
gilgal
to
gibeah
at
gibeah
the
following
verse
xiii
goes
on
abode
saul
and
jonathan
and
their
men
when
the
philistines
encamped
in
michmash
the
change
of
place
distinctly
shows
the
whole
passage
about
the
meeting
of
the
king
with
the
prophet
at
gilgal
xiii
to
be
an
insertion
by
a
later
hand
at
the
beginning
of
the
narrative
saul
is
at
gibeah
ver
and
the
philistines
seek
him
there
and
halt
before
the
place
because
they
meet
with
resistance
all
at
once
at
ver
it
is
assumed
without
being
stated
that
saul
had
stayed
at
gilgal
since
he
was
chosen
king
till
now
and
had
only
now
advanced
from
there
against
the
philistines
who
were
waiting
for
him
before
gibeah
verse
however
gives
us
the
impression
that
saul
had
been
posted
at
gibeah
with
his
men
for
some
time
when
the
philistines
took
up
their
camp
over
against
them
only
in
this
way
is
justice
done
to
the
contrasted
participle
of
state
and
inchoative
perfect
and
in
the
sequel
the
triumphant
continuation
of
the
story
especially
in
chap
shows
no
indication
that
the
ominous
scene
in
gilgal
weighed
on
the
mind
of
saul
or
of
the
people
or
of
the
historian
according
to
xiii
saul
is
to
wait
seven
days
for
samuel
at
gilgal
here
there
is
a
reference
to
x
where
the
seer
says
to
the
future
king
thou
shalt
go
down
before
me
to
gilgal
and
i
will
come
after
thee
there
to
offer
sacrifices
seven
days
shalt
thou
tarry
till
i
come
and
show
thee
what
thou
shalt
do
this
verse
is
condemned
by
other
arguments
than
its
connection
with
xii
samuel
object
at
this
point
according
to
is
to
overcome
the
reluctance
of
the
benjamite
who
had
gone
forth
to
seek
his
asses
to
undertake
the
high
calling
announced
to
him
and
to
inspire
him
with
faith
and
confidence
not
to
give
him
unintelligible
directions
as
to
what
he
is
to
do
first
when
he
has
actually
become
king
and
how
long
he
has
to
wait
for
the
seer
at
gilgal
the
schoolmaster
tone
of
x
is
particularly
out
of
place
after
the
preceding
words
of
ver
that
when
the
three
signs
have
come
to
pass
saul
is
to
do
what
his
hand
finds
because
god
is
with
him
this
is
surely
giving
him
perfect
freedom
of
action
and
for
the
reason
that
god
spirit
is
working
in
him
which
bloweth
where
it
listeth
and
suffers
no
interference
from
any
authority
it
is
also
clear
that
the
writer
of
x
xiii
can
not
possibly
have
found
samuel
in
gilgal
in
chap
xi
before
making
him
go
there
in
chap
xiii
we
have
already
seen
xi
to
be
a
later
addition
the
name
of
samuel
must
be
interpolated
in
too
in
fact
in
xi
the
people
the
army
acts
quite
of
itself
even
in
our
present
text
hence
it
follows
also
that
x
xiii
are
older
than
vii
viii
x
seq
xii
this
insertion
is
based
on
an
older
account
of
the
breach
between
samuel
and
saul
in
xv
here
also
the
matter
of
dispute
is
a
sacrifice
and
gilgal
is
the
scene
and
this
alone
serves
to
explain
how
gilgal
is
adhered
to
in
xiii
in
spite
of
all
impossibility
as
being
the
right
and
necessary
place
for
the
occurrence
jehovah
by
the
mouth
of
samuel
commands
the
king
to
devote
the
amalekites
to
destruction
because
of
an
act
of
treachery
they
had
committed
against
israel
in
ancient
times
and
to
spare
no
living
thing
saul
accordingly
makes
war
on
the
amalekites
and
defeats
them
but
he
does
not
carry
out
the
proscription
entirely
as
he
spares
the
best
of
their
cattle
and
their
king
agag
whom
he
takes
prisoner
at
gilgal
where
the
victory
is
celebrated
before
jehovah
he
is
called
to
account
for
this
by
samuel
and
states
that
he
intended
the
booty
for
a
sacrifice
to
jehovah
his
statement
however
makes
no
impression
behold
to
obey
is
better
than
sacrifice
and
to
hearken
than
the
fat
of
rams
behold
rebellion
is
as
the
sin
of
witchcraft
and
stubbornness
is
as
idolatry
and
teraphim
because
thou
hast
rejected
the
word
of
jehovah
he
also
hath
rejected
thee
the
king
acknowledges
his
guilt
and
tries
to
pacify
samuel
but
the
latter
turns
from
him
in
anger
and
when
saul
lays
hold
of
him
his
mantle
tears
jehovah
hath
torn
the
kingdom
of
israel
from
thee
this
day
and
given
it
to
one
better
than
thee
and
the
truthful
one
of
israel
will
not
lie
nor
repent
for
he
is
not
a
man
that
he
should
repent
yet
at
saul
entreaty
that
he
would
at
least
not
refuse
to
honour
him
before
the
people
samuel
takes
part
in
the
sacrifice
and
even
begins
it
by
hewing
agag
in
pieces
before
jehovah
then
they
part
never
to
see
each
other
again
but
samuel
mourns
for
saul
that
jehovah
had
repented
of
having
made
him
king
over
israel
there
is
another
narrative
intimately
connected
with
this
one
in
subject
and
treatment
thought
and
expression
namely
that
of
the
witch
of
endor
when
saul
shortly
before
the
battle
in
which
he
fell
surveyed
the
hostile
army
he
was
seized
with
anxiety
and
terror
he
inquired
of
jehovah
but
received
no
answer
neither
by
dreams
nor
by
the
ephod
nor
by
prophets
in
his
extremity
he
was
driven
into
the
arms
of
a
black
art
which
he
had
formerly
persecuted
and
sought
to
extirpate
by
night
and
in
disguise
with
two
companions
he
sought
out
a
woman
at
endor
who
practiced
the
raising
of
the
dead
and
after
reassuring
her
with
regard
to
the
mortal
danger
connected
with
the
practice
of
her
art
he
bade
her
call
up
samuel
she
on
seeing
the
spirit
ascending
at
once
perceives
that
the
man
he
had
come
up
to
converse
with
is
the
king
himself
she
cries
out
loud
but
allows
herself
to
be
reassured
and
describes
the
appearance
of
the
dead
person
saul
does
not
see
him
only
hears
him
speak
why
hast
thou
disquieted
me
to
bring
me
up
jehovah
doeth
to
thee
as
he
spake
by
me
he
rends
the
kingdom
out
of
thy
hand
and
gives
it
to
another
because
thou
obeyedst
not
the
voice
of
jehovah
nor
executedst
his
fierce
wrath
upon
amalek
shalt
thou
and
thy
sons
be
with
me
and
jehovah
also
shall
deliver
the
host
of
israel
into
the
hands
of
the
philistines
at
these
words
saul
falls
all
his
length
on
the
ground
he
had
eaten
nothing
all
the
day
before
and
all
night
he
is
with
difficulty
induced
to
take
some
food
then
he
rises
up
with
his
men
to
go
and
meet
his
fate
samuel
xxviii
comparing
with
this
original
the
copy
in
xiii
we
are
struck
in
the
first
place
with
the
placing
of
the
rupture
so
much
earlier
scarcely
is
saul
made
king
when
he
is
deposed
on
the
spot
at
gilgal
and
for
what
reason
samuel
has
fixed
in
a
purely
arbitrary
fashion
the
time
he
is
to
wait
and
saul
waits
and
makes
arrangements
for
departure
only
when
the
time
has
run
out
although
the
need
is
pressing
and
for
this
he
is
rejected
it
is
clear
that
samuel
has
from
the
first
felt
towards
him
as
a
legitimate
prince
feels
to
a
usurper
he
has
arranged
so
as
to
find
an
occasion
to
show
unmistakably
where
they
both
stand
strictly
speaking
he
did
not
find
the
occasion
saul
having
observed
the
appointed
time
but
the
opinion
is
present
though
unexpressed
that
the
king
was
not
entitled
to
sacrifice
either
before
the
expiry
of
the
seven
days
or
at
any
time
his
sacrificing
is
regarded
as
sacrilege
and
thus
the
autonomous
theocracy
stands
all
at
once
before
our
eyes
which
no
one
thought
of
before
ezekiel
we
are
reminded
of
the
stories
of
joash
and
uzziah
in
the
chronicles
the
incidents
in
xv
xxviii
are
similar
but
the
spirit
of
the
narrative
is
different
and
more
antique
the
rejection
does
not
come
here
with
such
mad
haste
and
we
do
not
get
the
impression
that
samuel
is
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
wash
his
hands
of
the
king
on
the
contrary
he
honours
him
before
the
people
he
mourns
that
jehovah
has
rejected
him
and
saul
who
never
again
sees
him
alive
turns
to
him
dead
in
the
hour
of
his
extremity
and
does
not
regard
him
as
his
implacable
enemy
again
in
the
former
case
the
king
offence
is
that
he
has
too
low
an
estimate
of
the
sacredness
of
sacrifice
and
fails
to
regard
the
altar
as
unapproachable
to
the
laity
while
in
the
latter
case
he
is
reproached
with
attaching
to
sacrifice
far
too
high
a
value
in
the
former
case
in
fine
the
deity
and
the
representative
of
the
deity
act
with
absolute
caprice
confront
men
stiffly
with
commands
of
incredible
smallness
and
challenge
them
to
opposition
in
the
latter
the
conduct
of
samuel
is
not
supposing
it
to
have
been
the
custom
to
devote
enemies
to
destruction
unintelligible
nor
his
demeanour
devoid
of
natural
spirit
he
appeals
not
to
an
irresponsible
position
but
to
the
manifest
truth
that
obedience
is
better
than
the
fat
of
rams
not
that
chapters
xv
and
xxviii
belong
to
the
original
growth
of
the
tradition
in
the
case
of
xxviii
it
is
easy
to
show
the
insertion
the
thread
of
xxviii
coming
from
chapter
xxvii
is
continued
at
xxix
according
to
xxviii
the
philistines
have
advanced
as
far
as
shunem
in
jezreel
in
xxix
they
are
only
at
aphek
in
sharon
and
they
do
not
go
on
to
jezreel
till
xxix
to
prove
an
insertion
in
the
case
of
chap
xv
we
might
point
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
direct
connection
between
xiv
and
xvi
but
this
must
be
proved
somewhat
circumstantially
let
it
suffice
then
to
say
that
in
the
preceding
narrative
of
saul
history
the
war
with
the
amalekites
appears
in
quite
a
different
light
ix
xi
xiii
xiv
cf
also
numbers
xxiv
the
occasion
of
it
according
to
xiv
lay
in
the
needs
of
the
time
and
the
object
was
the
very
practical
one
of
saving
israel
out
of
the
hands
of
them
that
spoiled
them
there
is
nothing
here
to
suggest
that
the
campaign
was
undertaken
in
consequence
of
a
religious
command
to
punish
the
amalekites
for
an
offence
over
which
long
ages
had
passed
and
information
about
which
could
only
be
gathered
from
historical
books
dealing
with
the
age
of
moses
both
the
narratives
chap
xv
as
well
as
chap
xxviii
are
preludes
of
events
afterwards
to
happen
at
chap
xvi
david
appears
upon
the
scene
he
is
thenceforth
the
principal
person
of
the
story
and
thrusts
saul
on
one
side
chapter
xv
is
the
prophetic
introduction
to
this
change
the
fact
had
been
handed
down
that
saul
was
chosen
by
jehovah
to
be
king
how
was
it
possible
that
in
spite
of
this
his
rule
had
no
continuance
jehovah
who
as
a
rule
does
not
change
his
mind
was
mistaken
in
him
and
samuel
who
called
the
king
had
now
to
his
great
sorrow
to
pronounce
the
sentence
of
rejection
against
him
the
occasion
on
which
he
does
this
is
evidently
historical
namely
the
festival
of
victory
at
gilgal
at
which
the
captured
leader
of
the
amalekites
was
offered
up
as
the
principal
victim
the
sacrifice
of
agag
being
quite
repugnant
to
later
custom
it
was
sought
to
account
for
it
by
saying
that
saul
spared
the
king
but
jehovah
required
his
death
and
caused
him
to
be
hewn
in
pieces
at
the
altar
by
samuel
the
rest
could
easily
be
spun
out
of
this
it
is
superfluous
to
discuss
how
chapter
again
is
related
to
chap
xv
as
the
second
step
to
the
first
no
proof
is
wanted
to
show
that
this
is
the
prophetic
shadow
cast
before
the
fall
of
saul
in
his
last
fight
with
the
philistines
his
turning
to
the
witch
to
call
up
to
him
the
departed
samuel
suggests
in
the
most
powerful
way
his
condition
of
since
samuel
turned
away
from
him
and
to
general
colouring
of
the
hostile
relation
between
saul
and
samuel
is
borrowed
from
the
actual
relations
which
must
have
come
to
subsist
between
the
prophets
and
the
kings
particularly
in
the
kingdom
of
samaria
i
kings
xiv
in
their
treatment
of
this
relation
our
narratives
manifestly
take
up
the
prophetic
position
and
the
doctrinal
ideas
of
which
they
are
made
the
vehicles
clearly
show
them
to
be
prophetic
conceptions
david
is
the
first
hero
of
judah
whom
we
meet
with
and
he
at
once
throws
all
others
into
the
shade
his
acts
are
narrated
to
us
in
two
detailed
and
connected
works
which
are
mutually
complementary
the
first
of
these
is
contained
in
xiv
sam
viii
and
in
it
we
are
circumstantially
informed
how
david
rose
to
the
throne
there
follows
his
principal
achievement
as
king
the
humiliation
of
the
philistines
and
the
foundation
of
jerusalem
the
work
concluding
with
a
short
notice
of
other
remarkable
circumstances
this
narrative
is
preserved
to
us
complete
only
not
in
the
earliest
form
but
with
many
interruptions
and
alterations
the
second
work
ii
is
mutilated
at
its
commencement
but
otherwise
almost
completely
intact
if
be
removed
it
tells
chiefly
of
the
occurrences
at
the
court
of
jerusalem
in
the
later
years
of
the
king
and
carefully
traces
the
steps
by
which
solomon
whose
birth
with
its
attendant
circumstances
is
narrated
at
the
outset
reached
the
throne
over
the
heads
of
his
brothers
amnon
absalom
and
adonijah
who
stood
before
him
both
works
are
marked
by
an
essentially
historical
character
the
treatment
is
much
more
detailed
while
not
nearly
so
poetical
as
in
the
history
of
saul
ix
there
are
no
exaggerations
such
as
xiv
seq
the
second
is
the
better
work
of
the
two
and
frequently
affords
us
a
glance
into
the
very
heart
of
events
showing
us
the
natural
occasions
and
human
motives
which
gave
rise
to
the
different
actions
the
point
of
view
is
however
the
narrow
one
of
jerusalem
for
example
the
real
reasons
of
the
revolt
of
the
men
of
judah
under
absalom
are
scarcely
even
hinted
at
the
leading
sentiment
of
the
writer
there
can
be
no
doubt
is
enthusiasm
for
david
but
his
weaknesses
are
not
concealed
the
relations
prevailing
at
his
court
far
from
edifying
as
they
are
are
faithfully
reported
and
the
palace
intrigue
which
placed
solomon
upon
the
throne
is
narrated
with
a
naivete
which
is
almost
malicious
the
first
work
viii
gives
a
less
circumstantial
narrative
but
follows
the
thread
of
events
not
less
conscientiously
and
is
based
on
information
little
inferior
to
that
of
the
second
the
partisanship
is
more
noticeable
as
he
follows
the
style
of
a
biographer
and
makes
david
the
hero
of
the
history
from
his
very
first
appearance
although
king
saul
is
the
ruling
and
motive
power
in
it
but
judaistic
leanings
were
unavoidable
and
they
have
not
gone
so
far
as
to
transform
the
facts
nor
indeed
operated
in
a
different
way
or
to
a
greater
degree
here
than
local
interest
in
the
tribal
hero
which
is
always
the
earliest
motive
for
narration
has
done
in
other
cases
this
praise
applies
to
xvi
however
only
so
far
as
its
original
form
goes
it
is
different
with
the
insertions
here
very
numerous
which
have
crept
into
the
older
connection
or
replaced
a
genuine
piece
of
the
old
story
with
a
newer
edition
of
it
in
these
the
tendency
to
idealise
the
founder
of
the
dynasty
of
judah
has
worked
creatively
and
here
we
find
rich
materials
for
the
history
of
the
tradition
in
the
rude
style
in
which
alone
it
is
possible
as
yet
to
construct
that
history
the
beginning
of
the
first
work
especially
is
overgrown
with
later
legendary
formations
david
known
as
a
man
of
courage
and
prudence
and
of
a
skilful
tongue
and
recommended
moreover
by
his
skill
on
the
harp
came
to
the
king
court
and
became
his
xvi
he
so
approved
himself
in
the
war
with
the
philistines
that
saul
advanced
him
step
after
step
and
gave
him
his
daughter
in
marriage
xviii
but
the
success
and
fame
of
the
man
of
judah
filled
saul
with
jealousy
and
in
one
of
his
fits
of
frenzy
to
which
x
also
shows
him
to
have
been
subject
he
threw
his
javelin
at
david
who
was
seeking
to
drive
away
the
evil
spirit
by
his
playing
xix
david
agreed
with
jonathan
that
it
was
advisable
for
him
to
absent
himself
but
this
only
confirmed
the
king
suspicions
which
prompted
him
to
destroy
the
priests
of
nob
because
their
head
had
provided
david
with
food
and
consulted
the
oracle
for
him
xxi
xxii
the
fugitive
himself
saul
failed
to
lay
hands
on
he
gathered
round
him
his
own
family
and
other
desperate
men
and
became
their
leader
in
the
wilderness
of
judah
xxii
xxiii
xxv
to
escape
the
repeated
persecutions
of
saul
he
at
length
passed
over
to
the
country
of
the
philistines
and
received
the
town
of
ziklag
in
judah
as
a
fief
from
the
hands
of
the
prince
achish
xxvii
such
is
the
beginning
of
the
history
of
david
according
to
the
simple
thread
of
the
old
narrative
the
first
accretion
we
notice
is
the
legend
of
the
encounter
of
the
shepherd
boy
with
goliath
xvii
which
is
involved
in
contradiction
both
with
what
goes
before
and
with
what
follows
it
according
to
xvi
david
when
he
first
came
in
contact
with
saul
was
no
raw
lad
ignorant
of
the
arts
of
war
but
a
mighty
valiant
man
skilful
in
speech
and
of
a
goodly
presence
and
according
to
xviii
the
women
sang
at
the
victorious
return
of
the
army
saul
has
slain
his
thousands
of
the
philistines
and
david
his
tens
of
thousands
so
that
the
latter
was
the
leader
of
israel
beside
the
king
and
a
proved
and
man
evidently
something
of
a
different
nature
must
originally
have
stood
between
xvi
and
xviii
now
the
fate
of
the
story
of
goliath
xvii
involves
that
of
the
story
of
the
anointing
of
david
xvi
which
is
dependent
on
it
xvi
xvii
and
as
we
have
already
decided
that
chapter
xv
is
a
secondary
production
xiv
joins
on
at
once
to
xvi
in
xviii
where
we
are
told
of
the
origin
of
jealousy
several
of
the
worst
additions
and
interruptions
are
wanting
in
the
lxx
especially
the
first
throwing
of
the
javelin
xviii
and
the
betrothal
to
merab
xviii
the
insertions
are
most
varied
and
confusing
in
the
account
of
the
outbreak
of
the
hostility
of
saul
and
of
david
flight
chapters
xix
xx
chapter
xix
a
pointless
and
artificial
passage
betrays
its
later
origin
by
its
acquaintance
with
chapter
xvii
xviii
lxx
is
continued
at
xix
after
david
takes
flight
for
the
first
time
but
at
verse
he
is
still
at
home
and
makes
his
escape
the
second
time
with
the
aid
of
feminine
artifice
going
to
samuel
at
ramah
but
to
appear
in
chap
xx
at
gibeah
as
before
the
king
remarks
his
absence
from
table
jonathan
assures
him
of
his
father
favour
which
however
david
doubts
though
he
has
no
distinct
evidence
to
the
contrary
when
quite
certain
of
the
deadly
hatred
of
the
king
david
takes
flight
in
earnest
in
chapter
xxi
seq
we
find
him
at
nob
on
his
way
to
judah
but
at
xxi
he
goes
away
afresh
from
the
face
of
saul
it
is
evident
that
in
reality
and
in
the
original
narrative
the
flight
took
place
only
once
and
that
it
must
from
the
first
have
been
directed
to
the
place
of
refuge
to
judah
this
is
enough
to
dispose
of
xix
the
twentieth
chapter
is
impossible
in
the
connection
at
least
in
its
present
form
and
in
chapter
xxi
verses
and
must
be
left
out
in
the
section
which
deals
with
the
freebooter
life
of
david
chaps
considerable
pieces
have
been
added
xxvii
of
course
is
one
but
also
the
encounters
of
david
with
his
pursuers
there
are
two
versions
the
one
xxvi
is
placed
before
chapter
xxvii
on
account
of
verse
the
other
xxiii
is
placed
before
chapter
xxv
to
avoid
too
near
a
contact
there
is
a
good
deal
of
verbal
coincidence
between
the
two
and
we
are
entitled
to
regard
the
shorter
and
more
pointed
version
chapter
xxvi
as
the
basis
but
the
sequence
xxvi
xxvii
shows
beyond
a
doubt
that
chapter
xxvi
does
not
belong
to
the
original
tradition
the
process
of
inserting
the
additions
naturally
was
not
completed
without
all
sorts
of
editorial
changes
in
the
older
materials
xvi
though
proceeding
from
the
same
root
these
offshoots
are
by
no
means
of
the
same
nature
nor
do
they
all
belong
to
the
same
stage
of
the
process
some
of
them
are
popular
legends
and
unconscious
fictions
of
this
nature
is
the
story
of
michal
who
takes
the
part
of
her
husband
against
her
father
lets
him
down
in
the
evening
with
a
rope
through
the
window
detains
the
spies
for
a
time
by
saying
that
david
is
sick
and
then
shows
them
the
household
god
which
she
has
arranged
on
the
bed
and
covered
with
the
counterpane
xix
the
scenes
in
which
saul
and
david
meet
are
of
a
somewhat
different
colour
yet
we
notice
that
the
conviction
that
the
latter
is
the
king
of
the
future
does
not
interfere
with
the
recognition
of
the
former
as
the
king
and
the
anointed
of
jehovah
saul
too
appears
not
wicked
but
blinded
the
secondary
version
xxiii
seq
contains
not
to
speak
of
the
distinctly
later
insertion
between
verse
and
in
addition
to
the
touching
features
of
the
story
a
jest
telling
how
the
two
played
round
a
hill
which
took
its
name
from
the
circumstance
these
stories
present
certain
marks
which
serve
to
fix
their
date
in
the
history
of
the
religion
one
is
that
the
image
in
david
house
is
spoken
of
quite
simply
another
the
expression
in
xxvi
if
jehovah
have
stirred
thee
up
against
me
let
him
accept
an
offering
but
if
it
be
men
cursed
be
they
before
jehovah
because
they
have
driven
me
out
this
day
from
the
fellowship
in
the
land
of
jehovah
and
obliged
me
to
serve
other
gods
it
is
perhaps
not
by
mere
chance
that
this
speech
is
wanting
in
the
parallel
version
and
that
there
is
added
in
place
of
it
a
formal
act
of
recognition
which
saul
pays
at
the
end
to
his
destined
successor
as
for
the
story
of
goliath
it
is
also
quite
artless
but
its
religious
colouring
is
much
more
marked
the
speech
with
which
david
goes
to
meet
the
giant
is
characteristic
on
this
side
xvii
seq
thou
comest
to
me
with
a
sword
and
with
a
spear
but
i
come
unto
thee
in
the
name
of
jehovah
of
hosts
whom
thou
hast
defied
this
day
will
he
deliver
thee
into
mine
hand
that
all
the
earth
may
know
that
there
is
a
god
in
israel
and
that
this
assembly
hqhl
israel
may
know
that
jehovah
saveth
not
with
sword
and
spear
for
the
battle
is
his
this
approaches
to
the
religious
language
of
the
time
according
to
xxi
goliath
of
gath
whose
was
as
thick
as
a
weaver
beam
fought
in
the
this
expression
occurs
in
i
samuel
and
shows
this
legend
to
be
dependent
on
xxi
a
collection
of
anecdotes
about
heroes
from
the
philistine
wars
of
david
in
the
genuine
short
popular
style
on
supra
wars
not
in
saul
time
but
in
that
of
his
successor
and
was
killed
not
by
a
shepherd
boy
but
by
a
warrior
of
bethlehem
named
elhanan
the
theme
of
david
and
jonathan
has
no
doubt
a
historical
basis
but
for
us
it
is
found
only
in
versions
the
story
of
the
farewell
chapter
xx
must
be
placed
in
this
category
yet
it
appears
to
point
back
to
an
earlier
basis
and
the
earlier
story
may
very
possibly
have
belonged
to
the
connection
of
the
original
work
for
the
shooting
of
the
arrow
could
only
have
a
meaning
if
it
was
impossible
for
the
two
friends
to
have
an
interview
but
as
the
story
goes
they
come
together
and
speak
out
freely
what
they
have
in
their
hearts
and
so
the
dumb
signal
is
not
only
superfluous
but
unintelligible
and
meaningless
but
if
the
most
characteristic
trait
of
the
whole
story
does
not
fit
into
it
as
it
now
stands
that
is
just
saying
that
the
story
has
not
come
down
to
us
in
its
true
form
originally
jonathan
only
discharged
the
arrow
and
called
to
his
boy
where
it
lay
and
david
hid
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
shooting
range
heard
in
the
call
to
the
boy
the
preconcerted
signal
in
calling
that
the
arrow
was
nearer
him
or
beyond
him
jonathan
was
apparently
telling
the
boy
but
in
reality
telling
his
friend
to
come
towards
him
or
go
farther
away
from
him
the
latter
was
the
case
and
if
so
the
friends
could
not
enter
into
conversation
the
tearful
farewell
then
disappears
and
the
sentimental
speeches
spoken
before
it
in
the
same
style
in
which
jonathan
virtually
admits
that
his
father
is
right
and
yet
decidedly
espouses
david
cause
disregarding
the
fact
that
david
will
deprive
him
of
his
inheritance
only
in
one
direction
does
he
set
limits
to
his
he
makes
the
future
king
solemnly
promise
to
spare
his
family
here
manifests
itself
an
interest
belonging
to
the
time
of
the
narrator
the
oriental
custom
according
to
which
the
new
ruler
extirpates
the
preceding
dynasty
was
not
systematically
carried
out
by
david
and
a
special
exception
was
made
in
favour
of
a
son
left
by
jonathan
all
my
father
house
says
meribaal
xix
were
dead
men
before
my
lord
the
king
yet
thou
didst
set
me
at
thy
table
what
right
have
i
therefore
yet
to
complain
unto
the
king
even
about
injustice
now
this
son
of
jonathan
was
the
ancestor
of
a
jerusalem
family
which
flourished
till
after
the
exile
older
traits
in
xx
are
the
importance
attached
to
the
new
moon
the
family
sacrifice
at
bethlehem
perhaps
the
stone
bn
cl
which
appears
to
have
implied
something
inconsistent
with
later
orthodoxy
the
name
being
in
two
passages
so
singularly
corrupted
chapter
xviii
seq
manifests
tendency
in
a
bad
sense
even
apart
from
the
additions
of
the
masoretic
text
here
enmity
against
david
is
carried
back
to
the
very
beginning
of
their
relations
together
and
even
his
friendship
is
represented
as
dissembled
hatred
all
the
honours
with
which
the
king
covers
his
are
interpreted
as
practices
to
get
rid
of
him
he
makes
him
his
in
order
to
expose
him
to
deadly
danger
in
his
efforts
to
procure
the
hundred
foreskins
of
the
philistines
which
were
the
price
of
the
daughter
the
connection
can
not
dispense
with
xviii
seq
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
the
venomous
way
of
interpreting
the
facts
is
a
mark
of
later
revision
for
saul
here
practices
his
perfidies
with
the
cognisance
of
his
servants
who
must
therefore
have
been
well
aware
of
his
disposition
towards
david
but
the
old
narrator
proceeds
on
the
opposite
assumption
that
his
hatred
appeared
all
at
once
and
that
david
had
been
held
by
all
up
to
that
time
to
be
one
of
the
king
favourite
servants
cf
xxi
not
to
speak
of
chapter
xx
and
this
alone
agrees
with
the
nature
of
saul
as
it
is
everywhere
described
to
us
it
is
a
characteristic
circumstance
that
the
corruption
of
the
tradition
is
greatest
in
those
narratives
in
which
samuel
enters
into
the
history
of
david
there
are
two
insertions
of
this
kind
according
to
xix
david
flees
to
the
old
man
at
ramah
where
the
school
of
the
prophets
is
saul
sends
messengers
to
take
him
but
these
when
they
come
near
samuel
and
see
him
in
command
of
a
troop
of
ecstatic
enthusiasts
are
seized
by
the
frenzy
like
the
rest
the
second
set
of
messengers
whom
saul
sends
and
the
third
fare
no
better
and
saul
has
at
last
to
come
himself
but
he
also
is
drawn
into
the
vortex
tears
off
his
clothes
and
dances
before
samuel
and
david
the
only
spectators
of
the
bacchantic
company
till
he
falls
down
and
he
lies
naked
as
he
is
a
whole
day
and
a
whole
night
upon
the
ground
whence
the
proverb
is
saul
also
among
the
prophets
but
that
david
when
he
fled
fled
in
earnest
and
went
in
the
direction
of
judah
instead
of
amusing
himself
by
going
first
towards
the
north
is
perfectly
evident
as
much
so
as
that
it
is
a
serious
abuse
of
the
spirit
of
prophecy
to
make
it
serve
ends
which
are
foreign
to
its
nature
and
turn
it
into
a
mere
instrument
for
the
personal
safety
of
david
who
had
no
need
whatever
to
wait
for
saul
at
ramah
to
play
him
a
trick
there
the
narrative
which
is
unknown
to
the
author
of
xv
arose
out
of
the
proverb
which
is
quoted
in
it
but
this
receives
elsewhere
x
a
much
more
worthy
interpretation
we
can
scarcely
avoid
the
suspicion
that
what
we
have
before
us
here
is
a
pious
caricature
the
point
can
be
nothing
but
samuel
and
david
enjoyment
of
the
disgrace
of
the
naked
king
for
the
general
history
of
the
tradition
the
most
interesting
circumstance
is
that
samuel
has
here
become
the
head
of
a
school
of
prophets
and
the
leader
of
their
exercises
in
the
original
view
of
the
matter
chaps
ix
x
he
appears
alone
and
independent
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
companies
of
the
ecstatics
the
nebiim
he
is
a
or
seer
not
a
or
prophet
true
it
is
asserted
in
the
gloss
ix
that
the
two
words
mean
the
same
thing
that
what
is
now
called
was
formerly
called
but
that
is
scarcely
quite
correct
the
author
of
ix
knows
the
name
very
well
too
but
he
never
applies
it
to
samuel
he
only
uses
it
in
the
plural
of
the
troops
of
jehovah
intoxicated
dervishes
he
gives
it
quite
a
different
meaning
from
and
also
quite
a
different
meaning
from
that
in
which
isaiah
and
jeremiah
use
the
word
as
the
words
are
used
in
isaiah
and
jeremiah
would
rather
be
called
roeh
and
this
is
the
justification
of
the
gloss
ix
we
can
not
doubt
that
these
distinctions
rest
on
a
historical
basis
and
only
gradually
melted
away
in
later
times
so
that
samuel
the
seer
need
not
be
degraded
into
one
of
the
flagellants
david
flight
to
samuel
presupposes
some
previous
relation
to
him
and
xix
seq
seems
to
point
back
to
xvi
in
this
piece
david
career
begins
with
his
being
anointed
king
in
saul
place
at
jehovah
command
when
a
mere
shepherd
boy
who
was
not
even
counted
in
the
family
he
belonged
to
but
in
the
sequel
no
one
knows
anything
about
this
even
in
the
story
of
goliath
which
in
other
respects
harmonizes
better
with
xvi
than
any
other
piece
the
older
brothers
here
three
not
seven
know
nothing
of
the
anointing
of
the
youngest
although
they
were
present
and
heard
their
own
claims
discussed
xvii
in
the
stories
of
david
persecution
also
chapter
xxiv
saul
alone
is
the
sacred
person
the
anointed
of
jehovah
not
david
a
belief
that
david
is
chosen
for
high
things
by
god
is
quite
a
different
matter
from
an
anointing
which
has
already
taken
place
in
fact
and
if
consequent
and
antecedent
be
inseparable
we
must
remember
how
according
to
xv
samuel
not
only
withdraws
himself
from
saul
till
his
death
but
also
feels
grieved
for
him
till
his
death
it
is
a
harsh
transition
from
xv
samuel
came
no
more
to
see
saul
till
the
day
of
his
death
because
he
mourned
over
him
to
xvi
and
jehovah
spake
to
him
how
long
wilt
thou
mourn
for
saul
seeing
i
have
rejected
him
but
it
appears
clearly
that
the
appointment
of
the
successor
was
connected
with
and
a
consequence
of
the
deposition
of
the
predecessor
the
anointing
of
david
by
samuel
is
at
the
same
time
the
to
the
anointing
of
saul
by
samuel
this
is
clearly
seen
on
comparing
x
xi
and
the
spirit
of
god
leapt
upon
saul
with
xvi
and
the
spirit
of
jehovah
leapt
upon
david
and
it
departed
from
saul
in
the
former
case
the
inspiration
is
a
momentary
foaming
over
in
the
latter
the
leaping
notwithstanding
it
is
a
permanent
property
and
this
difference
alone
leaves
no
doubt
as
to
where
the
original
is
to
be
looked
for
and
where
the
imitation
saul
alone
according
to
the
old
tradition
was
made
king
in
a
divine
an
overpowering
and
ideal
manner
david
was
made
king
in
a
tedious
human
way
and
after
many
intermediate
stages
of
saul
alone
was
it
originally
told
that
the
sudden
outbreak
of
the
spirit
with
which
he
unelected
as
he
was
summoned
the
levy
of
israel
placed
himself
at
its
head
defeated
the
ammonites
and
became
king
was
quietly
prepared
by
an
old
seer
who
pointed
out
to
him
his
great
calling
and
filled
him
with
confidence
in
himself
by
secretly
anointing
him
in
the
name
of
jehovah
all
that
was
known
of
david
was
how
by
his
own
energy
he
raised
himself
from
a
soldier
to
be
the
leader
of
a
band
from
that
to
be
the
vassal
prince
under
the
philistines
of
ziklag
and
judah
and
from
a
vassal
prince
to
be
the
independent
and
powerful
king
of
israel
he
also
was
anointed
not
however
beforehand
by
god
but
after
his
elevation
by
the
elders
of
judah
and
israel
but
this
human
origin
and
this
inferiority
in
point
of
divine
consecration
to
a
predecessor
whose
kingdom
as
it
turned
out
jehovah
had
not
made
to
stand
was
found
by
a
later
age
to
be
unworthy
of
him
he
must
at
least
have
received
his
anointing
from
samuel
as
well
as
saul
and
this
was
accordingly
made
good
by
the
legend
xvi
it
is
a
step
further
on
this
downward
path
that
in
the
judaistic
version
x
seq
all
mention
is
omitted
of
the
anointing
of
saul
we
return
to
samuel
the
books
of
samuel
take
their
name
from
him
and
he
is
a
figure
of
great
importance
if
not
for
the
history
itself
yet
for
the
history
of
the
tradition
the
progress
of
which
may
be
measured
by
the
change
of
view
about
his
person
in
the
views
taken
about
him
we
may
distinguish
four
stages
originally
ix
he
is
simply
a
seer
but
at
the
same
time
a
patriotic
israelite
who
feels
deeply
the
need
of
his
country
and
uses
his
authority
as
seer
to
suggest
to
the
ear
and
to
the
mind
of
one
whom
he
recognises
as
fit
for
the
purpose
his
destination
to
be
israel
deliverer
and
leader
this
relation
between
seer
and
warrior
must
be
held
fast
and
regarded
as
historical
if
samuel
is
to
mean
anything
at
all
similar
instances
are
those
of
deborah
and
barak
in
earlier
times
and
later
that
of
elisha
and
hazael
and
still
more
that
of
elisha
and
jehu
samuel
greatness
consists
in
this
that
he
rouses
to
activity
the
man
who
comes
after
him
and
is
greater
than
he
after
kindling
the
light
which
now
burns
in
its
full
brightness
he
himself
disappears
but
his
meteoric
appearance
and
disappearance
excited
wonder
and
this
in
early
times
produced
a
story
of
his
youth
in
which
while
still
a
boy
he
predicts
the
ruin
of
israel
after
he
has
done
this
darkness
closes
completely
around
him
even
in
chapter
iv
he
has
completely
disappeared
and
when
we
meet
him
again
he
is
an
old
man
on
the
other
side
the
circumstance
that
we
hear
nothing
more
of
the
seer
after
his
meeting
with
saul
caused
it
to
be
believed
that
a
rupture
very
soon
took
place
between
the
two
this
belief
we
meet
with
at
the
second
stage
of
the
tradition
which
is
represented
by
the
prophetical
narratives
recorded
in
chaps
xvi
and
xxviii
it
arose
out
of
the
inconsistency
involved
in
the
fact
that
jehovah
did
not
afterwards
confirm
in
his
reign
the
man
whom
he
had
chosen
to
be
king
but
overthrew
his
dynasty
thus
it
becomes
necessary
that
samuel
who
anointed
saul
should
afterwards
sorrowfully
reject
him
even
here
he
appears
no
longer
as
the
simple
seer
but
as
a
prophet
in
the
style
of
elijah
and
elisha
who
regards
the
lord
anointed
as
his
own
handiwork
and
lays
on
him
despotic
commands
xv
though
according
to
x
he
had
expressly
left
him
to
be
guided
by
his
own
inspiration
the
transition
from
the
second
to
the
third
stage
is
easy
here
samuel
after
withdrawing
the
unction
from
saul
at
once
transfers
it
to
david
and
sets
him
up
against
his
rejected
predecessor
as
being
now
de
jure
king
by
the
grace
of
god
the
respect
with
he
is
regarded
has
meanwhile
increased
still
further
when
he
comes
to
bethlehem
the
elders
tremble
at
his
approach
xvi
seq
and
in
xix
seq
he
has
a
magical
power
over
men
up
to
this
stage
however
he
has
always
been
regarded
as
intellectually
the
author
of
the
monarchy
it
is
reserved
for
the
last
exilian
or
stage
of
the
development
of
the
tradition
to
place
him
in
the
opposite
position
of
one
who
resists
to
the
uttermost
the
desire
of
the
people
to
have
a
king
here
israel
is
advanced
to
a
theocracy
and
samuel
is
the
head
of
the
theocracy
which
accounts
for
the
feelings
aroused
in
him
by
their
demand
the
modern
judgment
has
been
prejudiced
in
saul
favour
by
samuel
curse
and
to
david
disadvantage
by
samuel
blessing
the
picture
of
the
one
has
not
suffered
from
the
blackening
so
much
as
that
of
the
other
from
the
glorification
the
efforts
of
later
writers
to
glorify
david
are
at
their
worst
in
their
account
of
his
last
testament
ii
even
the
language
betrays
this
piece
as
a
insertion
the
contents
are
borrowed
from
the
succeeding
narrative
but
in
the
narrative
solomon
conduct
towards
adonijah
abiathar
joab
and
shimei
is
not
dictated
by
any
means
by
the
testament
but
by
other
considerations
and
it
is
the
declared
object
of
the
narrator
to
show
how
solomon
throne
was
established
by
the
removal
of
the
elements
of
danger
nor
do
the
acute
calculations
of
the
weak
old
king
agree
very
well
with
the
general
impression
given
of
him
at
this
time
by
ii
some
critics
who
are
unencumbered
either
by
prejudice
or
by
knowledge
of
the
subject
regard
saul
as
the
antagonist
and
david
as
the
creature
of
the
clerical
lust
of
rule
of
which
they
see
the
embodiment
in
samuel
but
this
view
gives
samuel
a
powerful
position
over
against
the
king
such
as
he
can
not
have
possessed
unless
he
had
broad
ground
under
his
feet
and
an
influence
well
and
extensively
organised
did
he
find
support
in
the
nebiim
these
were
only
then
rising
into
view
out
of
an
irregular
enthusiasm
which
was
not
yet
confined
to
any
definite
circle
or
school
and
besides
the
old
tradition
speaks
of
a
close
connection
between
them
and
the
king
but
not
between
them
and
the
seer
the
belief
that
the
latter
was
the
founder
and
president
of
their
guild
is
based
on
the
worthless
anachronistic
anecdote
xix
seq
or
was
samuel
in
conspiracy
with
the
priests
against
saul
this
is
inferred
from
where
abimelech
of
nob
provides
david
with
bread
on
his
wanderings
and
expiates
this
offence
with
his
own
death
and
that
of
the
whole
race
of
eli
but
in
the
first
place
these
priests
have
no
connection
with
samuel
in
the
second
place
there
is
nothing
to
make
it
probable
that
they
had
an
understanding
with
david
or
were
acquainted
with
his
ambitious
plans
if
he
had
then
begun
to
cherish
them
in
the
third
place
it
is
positively
certain
that
they
represented
no
distinct
power
in
the
state
as
against
the
king
but
on
the
contrary
were
entirely
the
creatures
of
his
smile
or
frown
on
the
occurrence
of
a
faint
suspicion
they
were
put
to
death
to
a
man
without
a
dog
barking
to
remonstrate
the
liberal
view
we
are
discussing
of
samuel
relation
to
saul
and
david
is
based
on
the
erroneous
assumption
that
samuel
had
the
hierocracy
to
rest
on
in
his
acts
of
opposition
to
the
monarchy
but
the
student
who
carries
back
the
hierocracy
to
these
early
times
has
still
to
learn
the
very
elements
of
what
is
necessary
to
a
true
historical
appreciation
of
hebrew
antiquity
it
is
in
the
book
of
kings
that
the
last
revision
works
most
unrestrictedly
here
also
chronological
and
religious
elements
combine
to
the
building
up
of
the
framework
and
we
begin
with
examining
the
chronological
system
from
the
exodus
from
egypt
to
the
beginning
of
the
building
of
the
temple
was
a
period
of
years
and
from
the
latter
to
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
a
period
according
to
the
numbers
of
the
kings
of
judah
of
years
or
reckoning
the
exile
of
years
as
before
in
chronicles
the
succession
from
azariah
ben
ahimaaz
who
was
according
to
the
correct
reading
the
first
to
officiate
in
the
temple
of
solomon
to
jozadak
who
was
carried
away
in
the
captivity
consists
of
eleven
high
priests
thus
reckoning
the
exile
we
have
again
twelve
generations
of
years
each
the
detailed
figures
which
compose
the
total
are
here
more
complicated
which
is
no
doubt
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
some
of
them
are
dates
which
the
reviser
found
given
yet
in
this
instance
also
the
number
is
the
basis
of
calculation
as
we
see
in
the
reigns
of
the
kings
of
judah
from
the
division
of
the
kingdom
to
the
destruction
of
samaria
in
the
year
of
hezekiah
the
numbers
are
as
follows
rehoboam
and
abijam
asa
jehoshaphat
joram
ahaziah
athaliah
joash
amaziah
and
uzziah
jotham
ahaz
hezekiah
from
the
destruction
of
samaria
to
the
last
date
in
kings
xxv
hezekiah
manasseh
amon
have
josiah
jehoahaz
jehoiakim
jehoiachin
let
him
believe
who
can
that
it
is
a
mere
chance
that
the
figures
make
up
exactly
the
series
of
the
kings
of
israel
is
in
point
of
chronology
dependent
on
the
series
of
judah
according
to
the
numbers
of
the
latter
years
elapsed
from
the
division
of
the
kingdom
to
the
babylonian
captivity
and
if
we
assume
with
ezekiel
iv
that
samaria
fell
years
earlier
than
judah
years
remain
for
the
duration
of
the
northern
kingdom
the
figures
given
amount
in
fact
to
years
these
israelite
years
from
the
destruction
of
samaria
to
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
exceed
it
is
true
by
the
sum
of
the
parallel
years
of
judah
and
the
israelite
years
from
jeroboam
to
hosea
fall
short
of
the
years
in
judah
from
rehoboam
to
hezekiah
by
about
the
same
number
this
shows
that
no
effort
was
made
at
first
to
synchronise
the
individual
reigns
in
the
two
series
the
years
of
the
northern
kingdom
are
divided
by
the
epoch
of
jehu
into
and
if
we
take
them
at
the
half
of
the
must
be
changed
into
which
then
agree
with
the
contemporary
jewish
years
the
deduction
must
be
made
at
the
reign
of
baasha
then
we
get
the
following
play
of
figures
jeroboam
nadab
baasha
elah
omri
ahab
ahaziah
joram
that
is
to
say
the
eight
kings
have
together
years
the
first
four
and
the
last
four
each
two
have
the
average
number
the
other
consists
of
three
pairs
of
father
and
son
and
the
twice
years
belonging
to
each
pair
are
divided
so
that
the
father
gets
and
the
son
obviously
because
the
father
was
considered
much
more
important
than
the
son
numbers
of
the
kings
of
judah
from
solomon
years
jehoahaz
and
jechoiachin
are
not
counted
if
they
are
included
and
a
year
allowed
for
them
we
must
say
for
solomon
numbers
of
the
kings
of
israel
from
jeroboam
the
artificial
relations
of
the
numbers
as
explained
above
were
communicated
to
me
by
ernst
krey
on
the
point
that
the
synchronisms
do
not
belong
to
the
original
arrangement
see
jahrb
fur
deutsche
seq
the
correct
view
of
ezekiel
iv
was
first
published
by
bernhard
duhm
theol
dir
the
number
given
in
the
massoretic
text
in
verse
for
the
duration
of
the
captivity
of
the
northern
israelites
is
impossible
for
ezekiel
can
not
mean
that
they
have
been
years
in
exile
already
and
on
the
other
hand
he
can
not
reckon
the
remaining
period
of
their
punishment
at
more
than
years
because
years
is
his
calculation
of
the
period
of
exile
of
judah
and
the
restitution
of
israel
and
that
of
judah
are
in
his
view
to
take
place
at
the
same
time
and
indeed
that
of
egypt
as
well
obviously
because
brought
about
by
the
same
cause
xxix
the
fall
of
the
chaldeans
which
may
be
expected
to
take
place
in
years
the
number
has
got
into
verse
by
mistake
from
verse
where
it
is
used
of
a
quite
different
subject
not
the
years
of
the
exile
but
the
days
of
the
last
siege
of
jerusalem
the
gloss
verse
rests
on
a
similar
confusion
the
septuagint
correctly
gives
for
the
israelite
exile
the
number
of
years
or
according
as
the
last
years
in
which
their
punishment
continued
along
with
that
of
judah
were
included
or
omitted
it
may
be
remarked
that
compare
further
robertson
smith
in
the
journal
of
philologie
vol
the
great
period
thus
marked
off
and
artificially
divided
into
subperiods
is
surveyed
and
appraised
at
every
important
epoch
in
discourses
these
are
much
more
frequent
in
kings
than
in
judges
and
samuel
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
writer
speaks
in
his
own
person
or
by
the
mouth
of
another
in
reviews
of
the
past
he
speaks
himself
xvii
in
anticipations
of
the
future
he
makes
another
speak
viii
a
few
examples
must
be
cited
to
show
what
we
mean
the
great
epoch
of
the
work
is
the
building
of
the
temple
on
this
occasion
solomon
makes
a
great
dedicatory
oration
in
which
he
entreats
jehovah
to
hear
from
heaven
the
prayer
of
those
who
shall
seek
him
in
this
place
he
concludes
as
follows
if
they
sin
against
thee
for
there
is
no
man
that
sinneth
not
and
thou
be
angry
with
them
and
deliver
them
to
be
carried
away
captive
into
the
land
of
the
enemy
far
or
near
if
they
then
bethink
themselves
and
make
supplication
to
thee
saying
we
have
sinned
and
have
done
perversely
and
are
guilty
and
so
return
unto
thee
with
all
their
heart
and
all
their
soul
in
the
land
of
the
enemies
which
led
them
away
captive
and
pray
unto
thee
toward
their
land
which
thou
gavest
unto
their
fathers
the
city
which
thou
hast
chosen
and
the
house
which
thou
hast
built
for
thy
name
then
hear
thou
in
heaven
their
prayer
and
their
supplication
and
maintain
their
cause
and
forgive
thy
people
their
unfaithfulness
and
give
them
compassion
before
them
that
carried
them
away
captive
that
they
may
have
compassion
upon
them
for
they
be
thy
people
and
thine
inheritance
which
thou
broughtest
forth
out
of
egypt
from
the
midst
of
the
furnace
of
iron
and
didst
separate
them
to
thyself
from
among
all
the
people
of
the
earth
as
thou
spakest
by
moses
thy
servant
what
jehovah
answered
to
this
we
learn
in
chapter
ix
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
and
thy
supplication
which
thou
hast
made
before
me
i
have
hallowed
this
house
to
put
my
name
there
for
ever
and
mine
eyes
and
my
heart
shall
be
there
perpetually
if
thou
wilt
walk
before
me
as
did
david
thy
father
in
integrity
of
heart
and
in
uprightness
to
do
all
that
i
have
commanded
thee
and
wilt
keep
my
statutes
and
my
judgments
i
will
establish
the
throne
of
thy
kingdom
upon
israel
for
ever
as
i
promised
to
david
thy
father
saying
there
shall
not
fail
thee
a
man
upon
the
throne
of
israel
but
if
ye
or
your
children
turn
away
from
me
and
will
not
keep
my
statutes
and
my
judgments
which
i
have
set
before
you
but
worship
other
gods
then
will
i
cut
off
israel
out
of
the
land
which
i
have
given
them
and
this
house
which
i
have
hallowed
for
my
name
i
will
cast
out
of
my
sight
and
israel
shall
be
a
proverb
and
a
byword
among
all
people
and
this
house
a
ruin
and
when
they
ask
why
hath
jehovah
done
thus
to
this
land
and
to
this
house
the
answer
shall
be
because
they
forsook
jehovah
their
god
who
brought
forth
their
fathers
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
have
taken
hold
upon
other
gods
and
have
worshipped
them
and
served
them
the
division
of
the
kingdom
is
also
a
very
marked
era
in
the
history
it
is
introduced
by
a
prophecy
of
abijah
to
the
first
jeroboam
behold
i
rend
the
kingdom
out
of
the
hand
of
solomon
and
will
give
ten
tribes
to
thee
but
he
shall
have
one
tribe
for
my
servant
david
sake
and
for
jerusalem
sake
the
city
which
i
have
chosen
because
he
has
forsaken
me
and
worshipped
astarte
of
sidon
and
chemosh
of
moab
and
milcom
of
ammon
and
has
not
walked
in
my
ways
to
do
that
which
is
right
in
my
eyes
my
statutes
and
my
judgments
like
david
his
father
and
it
shall
be
if
thou
wilt
hearken
unto
all
that
i
command
thee
and
wilt
walk
in
my
ways
and
do
what
is
right
in
my
sight
to
keep
my
statutes
and
my
commandments
as
david
my
servant
did
that
i
will
be
with
thee
and
build
thee
a
sure
house
as
i
built
for
david
and
will
give
israel
unto
thee
and
i
will
for
this
afflict
the
seed
of
david
but
not
for
ever
we
pass
over
a
series
of
prophecies
in
a
similar
strain
which
occur
regularly
at
the
changes
of
dynasty
in
the
northern
kingdom
and
cite
only
the
concluding
words
which
accompany
the
fall
of
the
kingdom
of
the
ten
tribes
this
fall
came
about
because
the
children
of
israel
sinned
against
jehovah
their
god
which
brought
them
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
feared
other
gods
and
walked
in
the
statutes
of
the
heathen
whom
they
had
driven
out
and
in
the
innovations
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
because
the
children
of
israel
imputed
to
jehovah
their
god
things
which
are
not
so
and
built
them
high
places
in
all
their
cities
from
the
tower
of
the
watchman
to
the
fenced
city
and
they
set
up
pillars
and
asheras
on
every
high
hill
and
under
every
green
tree
and
there
they
sacrificed
in
all
the
high
places
as
did
the
people
whom
jehovah
had
driven
out
before
them
and
wrought
wicked
things
to
provoke
jehovah
to
anger
and
served
the
abominations
which
jehovah
had
forbidden
yet
jehovah
testified
to
them
by
all
the
prophets
and
seers
saying
turn
ye
from
your
evil
ways
and
keep
my
commandments
and
my
statutes
according
to
all
the
torah
which
i
commanded
your
fathers
and
which
i
sent
unto
you
by
my
servants
the
prophets
but
they
would
not
hear
but
hardened
their
necks
like
their
fathers
that
they
did
not
believe
in
jehovah
their
god
and
they
rejected
his
statutes
and
his
covenant
that
he
made
with
their
fathers
and
his
testimonies
with
which
he
warned
them
and
they
followed
vanity
and
became
vain
and
went
after
the
heathen
that
were
round
about
them
concerning
whom
jehovah
had
charged
them
that
they
should
not
do
like
them
and
they
left
all
the
commandments
of
jehovah
their
god
and
made
them
molten
images
and
an
asherah
and
worshipped
the
whole
host
of
heaven
and
served
baal
and
they
caused
their
children
to
pass
through
the
fire
and
used
divination
and
enchantments
and
sold
themselves
to
do
evil
in
the
sight
of
jehovah
to
provoke
him
to
anger
and
jehovah
was
very
wroth
with
israel
and
removed
them
out
of
his
sight
there
was
none
left
but
the
men
of
judah
only
but
they
of
judah
also
kept
not
the
commandment
of
their
god
but
walked
in
the
manner
of
israel
and
jehovah
rejected
the
whole
race
of
israel
and
humbled
them
and
delivered
them
unto
the
hand
of
spoilers
until
he
had
cast
them
out
of
his
sight
no
special
concluding
discourse
is
given
for
judah
but
that
for
israel
applies
to
judah
as
well
this
we
see
both
directly
from
the
last
words
of
the
passage
cited
and
from
the
circumstance
that
two
very
characteristic
abominations
in
the
foregoing
catalogue
the
worship
of
the
host
of
heaven
and
the
sacrifice
of
children
were
introduced
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
prophets
which
alone
can
determine
the
point
not
in
the
eighth
but
only
in
the
seventh
century
under
manasseh
and
accordingly
are
not
chargeable
on
israel
but
only
on
judah
the
water
accumulates
so
to
speak
at
these
gathering
places
of
the
more
important
historical
epochs
but
from
these
reservoirs
it
finds
its
way
in
smaller
channels
on
all
sides

first
such
additions

do
not
reckon
because
they
proceed
from
various
periods
and
are
mostly
younger
than
the
deuteronomic
revision
and
belong
rather
to
textual
than
to
literary
criticism
it
is
certainly
in
itself
very
important
to
detect
and
remove
these
the
whole
old
tradition
is
covered
with
them
question
asked
with
regard
to
each
ruler
is
what
position
he
took
up
to
the
pure
religion
whether
he
did
what
was
right
or
what
was
evil
in
the
sight
of
jehovah
even
in
the
case
of
those
who
only
reigned
a
week
this
question
receives
an
answer
in
general
it
has
to
be
stated
that
they
did
evil
all
except
david
and
hezekiah
and
josiah
were
defective
says
jesus
sirach
xlix
not
quite
accurately
perhaps
but
yet
truly
in
so
far
as
there
is
always
some
objection
even
to
the
good
kings
but
the
sin
here
reproved
is
no
longer
at
least
not
principally
the
worship
of
strange
gods
it
is
the
perverted
worship
of
jehovah
a
more
special
standard
and
therefore
a
stricter
one
is
now
employed
and
we
know
the
reason
of
this
the
temple
having
once
been
built
in
the
place
which
jehovah
has
chosen
for
himself
the
kindly
naturalness
hitherto
belonging
to
his
worship
comes
to
an
end
deuteronomy
xii
and
in
particular
the
prohibition
of
the
bamoth
comes
into
force
iii
that
these
continued
to
exist
is
the
special
sin
of
the
period
a
sin
widespread
and
persistent
it
is
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
with
the
bamoth
all
kinds
of
unlawful
abuses
crept
into
the
worship
of
jehovah
maccebas
and
asheras
evergreen
trees
and
prostitutes
of
both
sexes
israel
continually
compared
with
judah
in
the
matter
is
further
charged
with
a
second
great
sin
the
sin
of
jeroboam
the
golden
calves
at
bethel
and
at
dan
the
religious
estimate
combines
with
the
chronological
facts
to
form
that
scheme
in
which
every
single
reign
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
judah
is
uniformly
framed
sometimes
the
frame
is
well
filled
in
with
interesting
matter
but
in
not
a
few
cases
historical
matter
is
almost
entirely
absent
the
scheme
appears
most
nakedly
in
such
chapters
as
xv
xiii
xiv
xv
that
this
redaction
of
our
book
is
essentially
uniform
with
that
of
the
two
historical
books
which
precede
it
requires
no
proof
only
it
has
here
a
warmer
and
more
lively
tone
and
a
much
closer
relation
to
the
facts
in
consequence
of
this
we
find
it
much
easier
to
determine
the
point
of
view
from
which
it
proceeds
the
mere
fact
that
the
narrative
extends
to
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
nay
to
the
death
of
the
captive
king
jehoiachin
shows
that
we
must
place
the
date
of
the
work
not
earlier
than
the
babylonian
exile
and
indeed
the
second
part
of
the
exile
the
chronology
reckons
the
exile
in
the
period
of
years
giving
years
to
it
and
this
would
bring
us
still
lower
down
but
it
is
open
to
us
to
assume
that
this
is
a
later
modification
which
has
not
further
affected
the
general
character
of
the
work
krey
surmises
that
the
last
date
mentioned
the
liberation
from
prison
of
jehoiachin
in
the
year
after
his
accession
to
the
throne
was
originally
intended
to
form
the
lower
limit
of
the
chronology
especially
as
the
periods
of
years
under
which
as
we
have
seen
the
jewish
figures
naturally
fall
come
exactly
to
this
date
but
if
this
be
the
case
we
can
not
regard
the
or
year
of
solomon
as
the
era
started
from
for
then
there
is
no
room
for
the
or
remaining
years
of
solomon
reign
but
such
a
is
entirely
unnatural
solomon
years
can
not
be
torn
up
in
this
way
if
we
are
to
make
a
division
at
all
in
that
period
it
must
be
at
the
disruption
of
the
monarchy
the
natural
point
of
departure
for
the
series
of
kings
of
israel
and
of
judah
it
deserves
remark
that
the
years
of
jehoiachin
at
the
close
of
the
older
mode
of
calculation
which
perhaps
only
tried
to
bring
out
generations
of
years
but
also
perhaps
a
period
of
years
from
david
answer
to
the
years
of
solomon
at
the
beginning
of
the
method
now
carried
through
that
a
process
of
alteration
and
improvement
of
the
chronology
was
busily
carried
on
in
later
times
we
see
from
the
added
svnchronisms
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
judah
from
the
uncertain
statements
in
the
book
of
judges
some
of
them
parallel
with
each
other
the
interregna
and
minor
judges
and
the
threefold
counting
of
the
time
of
the
philistines
and
even
from
the
variants
of
the
lxx
the
writer
looks
back
on
the
time
of
the
kings
as
a
period
past
and
closed
on
which
judgment
has
already
been
declared
even
at
the
consecration
of
the
temple
the
thought
of
its
destruction
is
not
to
be
restrained
and
throughout
the
book
the
ruin
of
the
nation
and
its
two
kingdoms
is
present
to
the
writer
mind
this
is
the
light
in
which
the
work
is
to
be
read
it
shows
why
the
catastrophe
was
unavoidable
it
was
so
because
of
unfaithfulness
to
jehovah
because
of
the
utterly
perverted
tendency
obstinately
followed
by
the
people
in
spite
of
the
torah
of
jehovah
and
his
prophets
the
narrative
becomes
as
it
were
a
great
confession
of
sins
of
the
exiled
nation
looking
back
on
its
history
not
only
the
existing
generation
but
the
whole
previous
historical
development
is
condemned
a
fashion
which
we
meet
with
first
in
jeremiah
ii
iv
who
was
actually
confronted
with
the
question
as
to
the
cause
of
the
calamity
the
fall
of
samaria
suggested
similar
reflections
to
the
earlier
prophets
with
reference
to
the
northern
kingdom
but
their
views
are
as
a
rule
amos
isaiah
ix
not
nearly
so
radical
nor
so
hosea
does
certainly
trace
the
guilt
of
the
present
up
to
the
commencement
but
he
exemplifies
the
principle
like
micah
chapter
vi
chiefly
from
the
early
history
of
jacob
and
moses
as
for
the
really
historical
period
he
belongs
to
it
too
much
himself
to
survey
it
from
so
high
a
point
of
view
in
this
also
he
is
a
precursor
of
later
writers
that
he
regards
the
human
monarchy
as
one
of
the
great
evils
of
israel
he
certainly
had
very
great
occasion
for
this
in
the
circumstances
of
the
time
he
lived
in
ezekiel
carried
out
this
negative
criticism
of
the
past
to
greater
lengths
with
particular
reference
to
the
abominations
of
the
older
worship
chapter
xxiii
and
it
is
also
to
be
found
in
isaiah
xlii
xliii
though
here
it
is
supplemented
by
a
positive
and
greatly
more
suggestive
view
we
find
it
also
in
deuteronomy
and
in
leviticus
xxvi
the
whole
of
the
past
is
regarded
as
one
enormous
sin
which
is
to
be
expiated
in
the
exile
jeremiah
xxxii
ezekiel
xviii
xxxiii
isaiah
xl
the
duration
of
the
punishment
is
even
calculated
from
that
of
the
sin
leviticus
xxvi
the
same
attitude
towards
old
times
is
continued
after
the
return
zechariah
viii
ix
seq
nehemiah
ix
the
treatment
is
naturally
from
a
judaean
point
of
view
outside
of
jerusalem
the
worship
of
jehovah
is
heretical
so
that
the
political
revolt
of
the
northern
israelites
was
at
the
same
time
an
ecclesiastical
schism
yet
they
are
not
excluded
in
consequence
from
community
with
the
people
of
god
as
in
the
chronicles
the
old
traditions
are
not
thrown
so
completely
overboard
as
yet
only
after
the
destruction
of
samaria
by
the
assyrians
does
judah
continue
the
history
alone
almost
the
same
reverence
is
paid
to
david
and
his
house
as
to
the
city
and
the
temple
his
house
has
the
promise
of
eternal
continuance
with
regard
to
which
the
writer
likes
to
make
use
of
the
words
of
jeremiah
xxxiii
the
book
closes
doubtless
not
by
chance
with
the
liberation
from
prison
of
the
davidide
jehoiachin
this
is
the
earnest
of
greater
things
yet
in
store
in
the
words
of
abijah
to
jeroboam
also
when
he
says
that
the
humiliation
of
the
house
of
david
and
the
revolt
from
it
of
the
ten
tribes
will
not
last
for
ever
we
see
the
messianic
hope
appear
which
as
we
learn
from
haggai
and
zechariah
largely
occupied
the
minds
of
the
jews
at
the
time
of
the
exile
and
after
it
in
the
case
of
the
books
of
judges
and
samuel
it
is
not
perhaps
possible
to
decide
with
perfect
certainty
what
was
the
norm
applied
by
the
last
reviser
in
forming
his
estimates
of
the
past
in
the
books
of
kings
there
can
be
no
doubt
on
this
point
the
writer
deals
not
only
in
indefinite
references
to
the
will
of
jehovah
which
israel
ought
to
obey
but
resists
he
speaks
now
and
again
ii
xiv
xvii
of
the
written
torah
in
which
the
judgments
and
statutes
of
jehovah
are
contained
a
difference
which
indicates
one
must
allow
a
historical
feeling
now
the
code
which
is
implicitly
regarded
as
the
standard
is
that
the
discovery
of
which
under
josiah
is
circumstantially
narrated
in
xxii
deuteronomy
we
are
led
to
this
conclusion
it
is
allowed
on
all
hands
both
by
the
phraseology
of
the
reviser
and
by
the
spirit
of
his
judgments
he
condemns
those
sins
specially
against
which
deuteronomy
and
the
reformation
of
king
josiah
were
directed
and
the
one
verbal
quotation
made
from
the
book
of
the
torah
is
from
deuteronomy
xiv
deuteronomy
xxiv
on
the
other
hand
there
are
clear
signs
that
the
author
of
the
revision
was
not
acquainted
with
the
priestly
code
nowhere
is
any
distinction
drawn
between
priests
and
levites
the
sons
of
aaron
are
never
mentioned
the
idea
of
a
central
sanctuary
before
solomon
is
contradicted
by
iii
in
one
section
only
a
section
which
has
been
greatly
exposed
to
corrections
and
interpolations
of
all
kinds
namely
the
description
of
the
temple
and
its
consecration
do
we
meet
with
signs
of
the
influence
of
the
priestly
code
especially
in
the
massoretic
text
in
the
septuagint
this
is
not
so
much
the
case
the
most
important
example
of
this
has
already
been
investigated
if
accordingly
we
are
fully
justified
in
calling
the
revision
deuteronomistic
this
means
no
more
than
that
it
came
into
existence
under
the
influence
of
deuteronomy
which
pervaded
the
whole
century
of
the
exile
the
difference
between
deuteronomistic
and
deuteronomic
is
one
not
of
time
only
but
of
matter
as
well
deuteronomy
itself
has
not
yet
come
to
regard
but
still
from
the
time
of
the
kings
are

the
cultus
in
this
way
as
the
chief
end
of
israel
and
is
much
closer
to
the
realism
of
the
actual
life
of
the
people
a
difference
in
detail
which
allows
of
easy
demonstration
is
connected
with
the
mode
of
dating
the
last
reviser
distinguishes
the
months
not
by
their
old
hebrew
names
zif
bul
ethanim
but
by
numbers
commencing
with
spring
as
the
beginning
of
the
year
in
this
he
differs
not
only
from
his
older
sources
vi
viii
but
also
from
deuteronomy
this
revision
is
as
we
expect
to
find
alien
to
the
materials
it
found
to
work
on
so
that
it
does
violence
to
them
they
have
been
altered
in
particular
by
a
very
selection
which
is
determined
by
certain
religious
views
in
these
views
an
interest
in
the
prophets
mingles
with
the
interest
in
worship
it
is
not
meant
that
the
selection
is
due
entirely
to
the
last
reviser
though
it
is
thoroughly
according
to
his
taste
others
had
probably
worked
before
him
in
this
direction
but
for
us
it
is
neither
possible
nor
important
to
distinguish
the
different
steps
in
the
process
of
sifting
through
which
the
traditions
of
the
time
of
the
kings
had
to
pass
the
culminating
point
of
the
whole
book
is
the
building
of
the
temple
almost
all
that
is
told
about
solomon
has
reference
to
it
this
at
once
indicates
to
us
the
point
of
view
it
is
one
which
dominates
all
judaistic
history
the
history
is
that
of
the
temple
rather
than
of
the
kingdom
the
fortunes
of
the
sanctuary
and
its
treasures
the
institution
and
arrangements
of
the
kings
with
reference
to
worship
we
are
kept
about
these
but
about
hardly
anything
else
the
few
detailed
narratives
given
xi
seq
xvi
xxii
seq
have
the
temple
for
their
scene
and
turn
on
the
temple
only
in
xviii
seq
does
the
prophetical
interest
predominate
as
for
the
kingdom
of
israel
the
statements
about
the
cultus
of
that
state
are
very
scanty
and
for
the
most
part
rather
vague
here
the
prophetical
narratives
come
to
the
front
generally
such
as
are
told
from
the
prophetic
point
of
view
or
at
least
tell
of
the
public
appearances
and
acts
of
the
prophets
here
and
there
we
are
told
of
occasions
on
which
the
northern
kingdom
came
in
contact
with
judah
here
the
jewish
feeling
appears
which
dictated
the
selection
what
is
merely
historical
purely
secular
is
communicated
only
in
the
scantiest
measure
often
there
is
nothing
but
the
names
and
succession
of
the
kings
we
learn
hardly
anything
about
king
omri
the
founder
of
the
town
of
samaria
and
of
the
kingdom
who
seems
to
have
reduced
judah
also
to
the
position
of
a
dependent
ally
nor
do
we
learn
more
about
jeroboam
the
last
great
ruler
of
israel
while
the
conflict
with
the
assyrians
and
the
fall
of
samaria
are
despatched
in
a
couple
of
verses
which
tell
us
scarcely
anything
at
all
sometimes
a
brilliant
breaks
in
on
the
surrounding
night
ix
x
but
after
it
we
grope
in
the
dark
again
only
so
much
of
the
old
tradition
has
been
preserved
as
those
of
a
later
age
held
to
be
of
religious
value
it
has
lost
its
original
centre
of
gravity
and
assumed
an
attitude
which
it
certainly
had
not
at
first
it
may
have
been
the
case
in
judah
that
the
temple
was
of
more
importance
than
the
kingdom
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
history
of
israel
was
not
entirely
not
even
principally
the
history
of
prophecy
the
losses
we
have
to
deplore
must
have
affected
the
israelitish
tradition
most
seriously
the
damage
done
by
the
revision
by
its
meddling
with
the
materials
as
found
in
the
sources
is
not
so
irreparable
yet
it
is
considerable
enough
the
change
of
colour
which
was
effected
may
be
best
seen
and
characterised
in
the
observations
which
introduce
the
israelite
series
of
kings
jeroboam
said
in
his
heart
now
shall
the
kingdom
return
to
the
house
of
david
if
this
people
go
up
to
do
sacrifice
in
the
house
of
jehovah
at
jerusalem
then
shall
the
heart
of
this
people
turn
again
to
their
rightful
lord
and
they
will
kill
me
and
become
subject
again
to
rehoboam
king
of
judah
whereupon
the
king
took
counsel
and
made
two
calves
of
gold
and
said
unto
them
cease
to
go
up
to
jerusalem
behold
thy
gods
o
israel
which
brought
thee
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
he
set
the
one
in
bethel
and
the
other
in
dan
and
this
thing
became
a
sin
for
the
people
went
as
one
man
even
unto
dan
and
he
made
temples
of
high
places
and
took
priests
from
the
midst
of
the
people
which
were
not
of
the
house
of
levi
whomsoever
he
would
he
installed
as
priest
of
the
high
places
xii
xiii
the
perversion
is
scarcely
so
great
as
in
chronicles
but
the
anachronism
is
sufficiently
glaring
in
the
mode
of
view
discernible
in
these
reflections
of
jeroboam
who
appears
to
feel
that
the
ephraimite
kingdom
was
illegitimate
in
its
origin
and
could
only
be
kept
separate
from
the
south
by
artificial
means
the
blessing
of
jacob
and
the
blessing
of
moses
show
us
what
the
sentiment
of
northern
israel
actually
was
in
the
former
joseph
is
called
the
crowned
of
his
brethren
in
the
second
we
read
his
bullock
full
of
majesty
the
king
has
the
horns
of
a
buffalo
with
which
he
thrusts
down
the
peoples
these
are
the
ten
thousands
of
ephraim
and
the
thousands
of
manasseh
whence
came
the
charm
of
the
name
of
ephraim
but
from
its
being
the
royal
tribe
and
the
most
distinguished
representative
of
the
proud
name
of
israel
of
judah
we
read
in
the
same
chapter
hear
jehovah
the
voice
of
judah
and
bring
him
back
to
his
people
there
can
be
no
doubt
what
the
people
is
to
which
judah
belongs
we
can
not
but
agree
with
graf
that
this
tribe
is
here
regarded
as
the
alienated
member
and
its
reunion
with
the
greater
kingdom
spoken
of
as
the
desire
of
judah
itself
and
this
is
not
so
remarkable
when
we
reflect
that
the
part
belongs
to
the
whole
and
not
the
whole
to
the
part
only
by
long
experience
did
judah
learn
the
blessing
of
a
settled
dynasty
and
ephraim
the
curse
of
perpetual
changes
on
the
throne
judah
power
of
attraction
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
northern
kingdom
is
thought
to
lie
in
the
cultus
of
the
solomonic
temple
and
jeroboam
is
said
to
have
tried
to
meet
this
by
creating
new
sanctuaries
a
new
form
of
the
worship
of
jehovah
and
a
new
order
of
priesthood
the
features
in
which
the
samaritan
worship
differed
from
the
jewish
pattern
are
represented
as
intentional
innovations
of
the
first
king
in
whose
sin
posterity
persisted
but
in
making
bethel
and
dan
temples
of
the
kingdom
that
he
set
up
high
places
is
a
statement
which
need
not
be
considered
jeroboam
did
nothing
more
than
solomon
had
done
before
him
only
he
had
firmer
ground
under
his
feet
than
solomon
bethel
and
dan
being
old
sanctuaries
which
jerusalem
was
not
the
golden
calves
again
which
he
set
up
differed
in
their
gold
but
not
in
their
object
from
the
ephods
and
idols
of
other
kinds
which
were
everywhere
to
be
found
in
the
older
houses
of
god
from
the
brazen
serpent
at
jerusalem
although
jeroboam
had
lived
in
egypt
it
would
he
wrong
to
say
that
he
brought
animal
worship
with
him
from
that
country
as
wrong
as
to
regard
aaron
golden
calf
as
a
copy
of
apis
the
peculiarity
of
the
of
egypt
and
of
its
in
particular
was
that
sanctity
was
attributed
to
animals
vatke
egyptian
gods
can
not
help
against
egypt
exodus
xxxii
xii
even
eichhorn
remarked
with
force
and
point
that
though
elijah
and
elisha
protested
against
the
imported
worship
of
baal
of
tyre
they
were
the
actual
champions
of
the
jehovah
of
bethel
and
dan
and
did
not
think
of
protesting
against
his
pictorial
representation
even
amos
makes
no
such
protest
hosea
is
the
first
who
does
so
as
for
the
priests
whom
the
king
is
said
to
have
installed
all
that
is
necessary
has
been
said
on
this
subject
above
a
remarkable
criticism
on
this
estimate
of
the
samaritan
worship
follows
immediately
afterwards
in
the
avowal
that
that
of
judah
was
not
different
at
the
time
at
any
rate
not
better
in
the
report
of
rehoboam
reign
we
read
xiv
seq
they
of
judah
also
set
up
high
places
and
pillars
on
every
high
hill
and
under
every
green
tree
and
whoredom
at
sacred
places
was
practiced
in
the
land
this
state
of
things
continued
to
exist
with
some
fluctuations
till
near
the
time
of
the
exile
if
then
the
standard
according
to
which
samaria
is
judged
never
attained
to
reality
in
judah
either
it
never
existed
in
ancient
israel
at
all
we
know
the
standard
is
the
book
of
the
law
of
josiah
but
we
see
how
the
facts
were
not
merely
judged
but
also
framed
in
accordance
with
it
one
more
instance
is
worthy
of
mention
in
this
connection
king
solomon
we
are
told
had
besides
the
daughter
of
pharaoh
many
foreign
wives
from
moab
ammon
and
other
peoples
intermarriage
with
whom
jehovah
had
forbidden
deuteronomy
xvii
and
when
he
was
old
they
seduced
him
to
the
worship
of
their
gods
and
he
erected
on
the
mount
of
olives
at
jerusalem
high
places
for
chemosh
of
moab
and
for
milcom
of
ammon
and
for
the
gods
of
his
other
wives
as
a
punishment
for
this
jehovah
announced
to
him
that
his
kingdom
should
be
torn
from
him
after
his
death
and
given
to
his
servant
and
also
raised
up
adversaries
to
him
in
hadad
the
edomite
who
freed
edom
and
in
the
syrian
rezon
teen
eliadah
who
made
damascus
independent
and
by
the
prophet
abijah
of
shiloh
he
caused
the
ephraimite
jeroboam
who
then
had
the
supervision
of
the
forced
labour
of
the
house
of
joseph
in
the
fortification
of
the
city
of
david
to
be
nominated
as
the
future
king
of
the
ten
tribes
so
we
read
in
xi
but
edom
and
as
it
appears
damascus
as
well
broke
away
from
the
kingdom
of
david
immediately
after
his
death
xi
and
the
fortification
of
the
citadel
in
which
jeroboam
was
employed
when
incited
to
revolt
by
abijah
though
it
falls
somewhat
later
yet
belongs
to
the
first
half
of
solomon
reign
since
it
is
connected
with
the
rest
of
his
buildings
ix
now
solomon
can
not
have
been
punished
by
anticipation
in
his
youth
for
an
offence
which
he
only
committed
in
his
old
age
and
the
moral
connected
with
these
events
is
contradicted
by
chronology
and
can
not
possibly
be
ascribed
to
the
original
narrator
the
deuteronomistic
revision
betrays
itself
in
fact
in
every
word
of
xi
to
the
original
tradition
belongs
only
the
mention
of
the
many
wives
without
the
reprobation
attached
to
it
and
the
statement
about
the
building
of
the
altars
of
chemosh
and
milcom
and
perhaps
astarte
on
the
mount
of
olives
where
they
stood
till
the
time
of
josiah
xxiii
the
connection
of
the
two
events
in
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
belongs
to
the
last
editor
as
well
as
the
general
statement
that
the
king
erected
altars
of
the
gods
of
all
the
nationalities
represented
by
his
wives
in
the
books
of
kings
it
is
true
the
tradition
is
not
systematically
translated
into
the
mode
of
view
of
the
law
as
is
the
case
in
chronicles
what
reminds
us
most
strongly
of
chronicles
is
the
introduction
from
time
to
time
of
a
prophet
who
expresses
himself
in
the
spirit
of
deuteronomy
and
in
the
language
of
jeremiah
and
ezekiel
and
then
disappears

in

no

found

worked
them
out

thus

the
deuteronomistic

in

it

a
man
of
god
from
judah
here
denounces
the
altar
of
bethel
at
which
king
jeroboam
is
in
the
act
of
offering
sacrifice
in
these
terms
o

behold
a
son
shall
be

shall
be
burned
upon
thee
and
to
guarantee
the
truth
of
this
prophecy
to
be
fulfilled
three
hundred
years
afterwards
he
gives
the
sign
that
the
altar
shall
burst
asunder
and
the
ashes
of
the
sacrifice
upon
it
be
poured
out
which
at
once
takes
place
this
legend
however
does
not
really
belong
to
the
deuteronomist
but
is
a
still
later
addition
as
is
easily
to
be
seen
from
the
fact
that
the
sentence
xii
is
only
completed
at
xiii
it
deserves
remark
that
in
the
two
verses
which
introduce
the
thirteenth
chapter
xii
the
feast
of
tabernacles
is
fixed
in
accordance
with
the
priestly
code
as
the
of
the
month
in
this
case
also
we
are
able
to
discern
considerable
shades
and
gradations
in
the
sources
the
reviser
had
at
command
in
the
books
of
kings
for
the
first
time
we
meet
with
a
series
of
short
notices
which
arrest
attention
in
the
surroundings
they
are
in
by
their
brevity
and
directness
of
statement
and
the
terseness
of
their
form
and
have
the
semblance
of
contemporary
records
in
spite
of
their
looseness
of
arrangement
these
form
the
real
basis
of
our
connected
knowledge
of
the
period
and
the
religious
chronological
framework
is
regularly
filled
in
with
them
their
loose
connection
and
neutral
tone
made
it
specially
easy
for
later
editors
to
interweave
with
them
additions
of
their
own
as
has
actually
been
done
to
no
small
extent
the
passage
discussed
above
xi
gives
a
good
example
of
this
we
at
once
pick
out
the
terse
z
ybnh
wgw
from
the
barren
diffuseness
surrounding
it
these
valuable
notes
commence
even
with
solomon
though
here
they
are
largely
mixed
with
anecdotic
chaff
they
are
afterwards
found
principally
almost
exclusively
in
the
series
of
judah
several
precise
dates
point
to
something
of
the
nature
of
annals
of
rehoboam
xiv
of
jehoash
xii
of
hezekiah
xviii
of
josiah
xxii
and
of
solomon
vi
these
dates
occur
it
is
true
partly
in
circumstantial
jewish
narratives
but
these
are
intimately
related
to
the
brief
notices
spoken
of
above
and
appear
to
be
based
on
them
it
may
be
surmised
that
such
definite
numbers
existing
at
one
time
in
much
greater
abundance
afforded
the
data
for
an
approximate
calculation
of
the
figures
on
which
the
systematic
chronology
is
built
up
these
single
dates
at
any
rate
are
not
themselves
parts
of
the
system
the
same
is
true
of
the
statements
of
the
age
of
the
jewish
kings
when
they
ascended
the
throne
these
also
perhaps
go
back
to
the
annals
the
z
is
found
iii

ix
xi
xvi
xxii

xii
xiv
xv
xvi
and
with
these
the
characteristic
then
might
be
thought
to
be
connected
which
frequently
introduces
the
short
sentences
and
as
it
now
stands
is
generally
meaningless
in
what
circles
these
records
were
made
we
can
scarcely
even
surmise
could
we
be
certain
that
the
reference
to
the
royal
temple
of
judah
which
is
a
prevailing
feature
of
them
is
due
not
to
selection
at
a
later
time
but
to
the
interest
of
the
first
hands
we
should
be
led
to
think
of
the
priesthood
at
jerusalem
the
loyalist
perfectly
official
tone
would
agree
very
well
with
this
theory
for
the
sons
of
zadok
were
down
to
josiah
time
nothing
else
than
the
obedient
servants
of
the
successors
of
david
and
regarded
the
unconditional
authority
claimed
by
these
kings
over
their
sanctuary
as
a
matter
of
course
xvi
to
xii
these
notices
however
as
we
have
them
are
not
drawn
from
the
documents
themselves
but
from
a
secondary
compilation
perhaps
from
the
two
sets
of
chronicles
cited
at
the
end
of
each
reign
of
the
kings
of
israel
and
those
of
judah
from
which
at
all
events
the
succession
of
the
rulers
appears
to
the
drawn
these
chronicles
are
not
to
be
identified
it
is
clear
with
the
original
annals
the
of
the
annals
must
be
distinguished
from
the
themselves
whether
the
chronicle
of
anything
out
of
which
is
communicated
to
us
was
composed
much
earlier
than
the
chronicle
of
judah
which
seems
to
close
with
jehoiachim
and
whether
it
and
the
chronicle
of
solomon
xi
are
a
quite
independent
work
i
am
inclined
to
consider
doubtful
the
excerpts
from
the
annals
are
interrupted
by
more
extensive
episodes
which
are
interwoven
with
them
and
are
also
embraced
in
the
deuteronomistic
scheme
of
these
the
jewish
ones
are
the
minority
the
greater
part
are
samaritan
but
they
all
belong
to
a
very
limited
period
of
time
i
select
the
miraculous
history
of
elijah
as
an
example
of
these
to
show
the
sentiment
and
the
change
of
sentiment
in
this
instance
also
the
prophet
elijah
from
tishbeh
in
gilead
appears
before
king
ahab
of
samaria
and
says
by
the
life
of
jehovah
the
god
of
israel
whom
i
serve
there
shall
not
be
dew
nor
rain
these
years
but
according
to
my
word
the
story
begins
abruptly
we
require
to
know
that
ahab
stirred
up
by
jezebel
has
been
propagating
in
israel
the
worship
of
the
tyrian
baal
and
has
killed
the
prophets
of
jehovah
by
hundreds
this
is
the
reason
of
the
punishment
which
comes
on
him
and
his
land
xviii
elijah
vanishes
as
suddenly
as
he
appeared
we
find
him
again
at
the
brook
cherith
which
flows
into
the
jordan
then
in
the
land
of
baal
with
a
widow
at
zarepta
while
following
his
fortunes
we
are
made
to
feel
in
a
simple
and
beautiful
way
the
severity
of
the
famine
ahab
in
the
meantime
had
sent
out
messengers
to
take
him
and
had
required
of
every
state
to
which
the
vain
search
had
extended
an
oath
that
he
was
not
to
be
found
there
now
however
necessity
obliged
him
to
think
of
other
things
he
had
to
go
out
himself
with
his
minister
obadiah
to
seek
fodder
for
the
still
remaining
amos
vii
in
this
humiliating
situation
he
all
at
once
met
the
banished
man
he
did
not
believe
his
eyes
is
it
thou
o
troubler
of
israel
i
have
not
troubled
israel
but
thou
and
thy
father
house
after
this
greeting
elijah
challenged
the
king
to
institute
a
contest
between
the
prophets
of
baal
and
him
the
only
prophet
of
jehovah
left
remaining
a
trial
by
sacrifice
took
place
on
mount
carmel
before
the
whole
people
each
party
was
to
prepare
a
bullock
and
lay
it
on
the
altar
without
setting
fire
to
the
wood
and
the
divinity
who
should
answer
by
fire
was
the
true
god
the
prophets
of
baal
came
first
and
sought
after
their
own
manner
to
influence
their
deity
they
shouted
and
leapt
wildly
wounded
themselves
with
swords
and
lances
till
they
were
covered
with
blood
and
kept
up
their
raving
ecstasy
from
morning
till
and
from
till
evening
during
this
time
elijah
looked
at
them
and
mocked
them
saying
cry
louder
for
he
is
a
god
either
he
is
talking
or
he
is
somehow
engaged
or
he
is
asleep
and
must
be
awaked
at
last
his
turn
came
he
repaired
the
altar
of
jehovah
which
was
broken
down
spread
the
pieces
of
the
sacrifice
upon
it
and
to
make
the
miracle
still
more
miraculous
caused
them
to
be
flooded
two
or
three
times
with
water
then
he
prayed
to
jehovah
and
fire
fell
from
heaven
and
consumed
the
sacrifice
the
people
up
to
this
point
divided
in
their
mind
now
took
the
side
of
the
zealot
for
jehovah
laid
hold
of
the
prophets
of
baal
and
slaughtered
them
down
below
at
the
brook
a
great
storm
of
rain
at
once
came
to
refresh
the
land
this
triumph
of
elijah
was
only
a
prelude
when
jezebel
heard
what
had
happened
she
swore
vengeance
against
him
and
he
fled
for
his
life
to
beersheba
in
judah
the
sanctuary
of
isaac
wearied
to
death
he
lay
down
under
a
in
the
wilderness
and
with
the
prayer
it
is
enough
now
o
jehovah
take
away
my
life
he
fell
asleep
then
he
was
strengthened
with
miraculous
food
by
a
heavenly
messenger
and
bidden
to
go
to
horeb
the
mount
of
god
he
arrived
there
after
a
long
journey
and
withdrew
into
a
cave
a
rushing
wind
sweeps
past
the
wind
and
the
earthquake
and
the
lightning
are
the
forerunners
of
jehovah
and
after
them
he
comes
himself
in
the
low
whispering
that
follows
the
storm
his
head
covered
elijah
steps
out
of
the
cave
and
hears
a
voice
ask
what
ails
him
having
poured
out
his
heart
he
receives
the
divine
consolation
that
his
cause
is
by
no
means
lost
that
the
direst
vengeance
the
instruments
of
which
he
is
himself
to
summon
to
their
task
is
to
go
forth
on
all
the
worshippers
of
baal
and
that
those
who
have
not
bowed
their
knee
to
baal
shall
gain
the
day
thou
shalt
anoint
hazael
to
be
king
over
damascus
and
jehu
ben
nimshi
shalt
thou
anoint
to
be
iiing
over
israel
and
elisha
ben
shaphat
to
be
prophet
in
thy
room
and
him
that
escapeth
the
sword
of
hazael
shall
jehu
slay
and
him
that
escapeth
the
sword
of
jehu
shall
elisha
slay
the
account
of
the
execution
of
these
commands
by
elijah
is
at
present
wanting
we
shall
soon
see
why
it
was
omitted
the
conclusion
of
chapter
xix
only
tells
us
that
he
called
elisha
from
the
plough
to
follow
him
of
the
account
of
the
judgment
which
overtook
the
worshippers
of
baal
this
group
of
narratives
contains
only
the
beginning
in
chapter
xxi
ahab
wanted
to
have
a
vineyard
which
was
situated
beside
his
palace
in
jezreel
his
favourite
residence
but
naboth
the
owner
was
unwilling
to
enter
on
a
sale
or
an
exchange
the
king
was
angry
yet
thought
he
could
do
no
more
in
the
matter
but
jezebel
of
tyre
had
other
notions
of
might
and
right
and
said
to
him
dost
thou
now
govern
the
kingdom
of
israel
be
of
good
courage
i
will
get
thee
the
vineyard
she
wrote
a
letter
to
the
authorities
of
the
town
and
got
naboth
put
out
of
the
way
by
means
of
corrupt
judges
as
ahab
was
just
going
to
take
possession
of
the
vineyard
which
had
fallen
into
his
hands
his
enemy
came
upon
him
the
prophet
elijah
always
on
the
spot
at
the
right
moment
hurled
the
word
at
him
hast
thou
killed
and
also
taken
possession
behold
in
the
place
where
dogs
licked
the
blood
of
naboth
shall
dogs
lick
thy
blood
also
here
this
story
breaks
off
what
follows
is
not
the
true
continuation
the
thread
of
the
narrative
xxi
is
also
broken
off
here
without
reaching
its
proper
conclusion
the
victory
of
jehovah
over
baal
of
the
prophet
over
the
king
is
wanting
the
story
of
naboth
is
as
we
said
only
the
introduction
to
it
we
are
sufficiently
informed
about
the
facts
but
in
form
the
narratives
do
not
answer
to
the
announcement
in
chapter
xix
and
xxi
they
are
drawn
from
other
sources
according
to
xix
the
syrian
wars
ought
to
result
in
vengeance
on
the
worshippers
of
baal
and
specially
on
the
idolatrous
royal
house
but
in
the
narrative
of
the
wars
xx
xxii
vii
ix
this
point
of
view
does
not
prevail
on
the
contrary
ahab
and
joram
there
maintain
themselves
in
a
manly
and
honourable
way
against
the
superior
power
of
damascus
it
is
only
after
the
extirpation
of
baal
worship
under
jehu
that
affairs
took
an
unfortunate
turn
and
hazael
who
brought
about
this
change
was
not
anointed
by
elijah
but
by
elisha
viii
seq
the
same
applies
to
jehu
ix
this
is
the
reason
of
the
above
remarked
omission
after
xix
cf
thenius
commentary
the
massacre
at
jezreel
too
which
is
predicted
in
the
threat
of
xxi
would
need
to
be
told
otherwise
than
in
ix
to
form
a
proper
literary
sequel
to
the
story
of
naboth
according
to
xxi
the
blood
of
ahab
is
to
be
shed
at
jezreel
according
to
ix
his
son
blood
was
shed
there
to
avenge
naboth
it
is
true
the
explanation
is
appended
in
xxi
that
as
the
king
took
to
heart
the
threats
of
elijah
jehovah
made
a
supplementary
communication
to
the
prophet
that
the
threat
against
ahab
house
would
only
be
fulfilled
in
the
days
of
his
son
but
who
does
not
see
in
this
an
attempt
to
harmonise
conflicting
narratives
a
whole
series
of
in
spite
of
xxi
an
attempt
is
made
at
xxii
to
show
that
the
threat
was
fulfilled
in
ahab
himself
we
are
told
that
ahab
was
shot
in
his
chariot
and
that
his
servants
brought
his
body
from
to
bury
it
there
then
we
read
xxii
and
they
washed
the
chariot
in
the
pool
of
samaria
and
the
dogs
licked
up
his
blood
and
the
harlots
bathed
in
it
according
to
the
word
of
jehovah
thus
it
is
explained
how
the
dogs
were
able
to
lick
his
blood
in
samaria
though
it
had
had
plenty
of
time
to
dry
up
after
the
battle
the
fact
was
unfortunately
that
according
to
xxi
the
dogs
were
to
lick
the
blood
of
ahab
not
at
samaria
but
at
jezreel
the
place
of
naboth
the
verse
xxii
is
an
interpolation
which
does
credit
to
jewish
acuteness
subordinate
discrepancies
might
be
mentioned
which
prove
that
ix
does
not
look
back
to
the
story
of
the
murder
of
naboth
as
told
in
xxi
according
to
ix
the
dispute
was
not
about
the
vineyard
but
about
the
field
of
naboth
which
lay
some
distance
from
the
town
his
family
was
put
to
death
along
with
him
and
on
the
following
day
when
ahab
rode
out
in
company
with
jehu
and
ben
deker
to
take
possession
of
the
field
the
word
of
the
prophet
not
framed
so
specially
against
him
personally
met
him
surely
i
have
seen
yesterday
the
blood
of
naboth
and
of
his
sons
and
i
will
requite
it
in
this
plat
with
the
help
of
these
other
accounts
among
which
there
is
a
considerable
group
of
uniform
character
xx
xxii
iii
vi
ix
favourably
distinguished
from
the
rest
we
are
placed
in
a
position
to
criticise
the
history
of
elijah
and
to
reach
a
result
which
is
very
instructive
for
the
history
of
the
tradition
namely
that
the
influence
of
the
mighty
prophet
on
his
age
has
after
all
been
appraised
much
too
highly
his
reputation
could
not
be
what
it
is
but
for
the
wide
diffusion
of
baal
worship
in
israel
and
this
is
not
a
little
exaggerated
anything
like
a
suppression
of
the
national
religion
at
the
time
of
elijah
is
quite
out
of
the
question
and
there
is
no
truth
in
the
statement
that
the
prophets
of
jehovah
were
entirely
extirpated
at
the
time
and
elijah
alone
left
surviving
the
prophetic
guilds
at
bethel
jericho
and
gilgal
continued
without
any
interruption
in
the
syrian
wars
prophets
of
jehovah
stand
by
the
side
of
ahab
before
his
last
campaign
there
are
four
hundred
of
them
collected
in
his
capital
one
of
them
at
least
long
known
to
the
king
as
a
prophet
of
evil
but
left
alive
before
and
left
alive
now
though
he
persisted
in
his
disagreeable
practices
of
the
sons
whom
jezebel
bore
him
ahab
called
one
ahaziah
jehovah
holds
and
another
jehoram
jehovah
is
exalted
he
adhered
to
jehovah
as
the
god
of
israel
though
to
please
his
wife
he
founded
at
samaria
a
temple
and
a
cultus
of
the
syrian
goddess
this
being
so
elijah
contest
with
baal
can
not
have
possessed
the
importance
attributed
to
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
later
time
in
the
group
of
popular
narratives
above
referred
to
there
is
no
trace
of
a
religious
commotion
that
tore
israel
asunder
the
whole
strength
of
the
people
is
absorbed
in
the
syrian
wars
the
kings
are
the
prominent
figures
and
do
well
and
according
to
their
office
in
battle
elijah
stands
in
the
background
from
several
indications
though
from
no
direct
statements
we
learn
of
the
high
esteem
which
ahab
enjoyed
from
friend
and
foe
alike
xx
xxii
joram
also
and
even
jezebel
are
drawn
not
without
sympathy
vi
ix
we
can
scarcely
say
the
same
of
jehu
the
murderer
instigated
by
the
prophets
of
the
house
of
ahab
ix
it
is
the
fact
certainly
that
the
prophets
hatred
of
baal
succeeded
at
last
in
overturning
the
dynasty
of
omri
but
in
what
manner
was
this
done
at
a
time
when
king
joram
was
prevented
by
a
wound
he
had
received
from
being
with
his
army
in
the
field
a
messenger
of
elisha
went
to
the
camp
called
the
captain
apart
from
a
banquet
at
which
he
found
him
to
a
secret
interview
and
anointed
him
king
when
jehu
returned
to
his
comrades
at
their
wine
they
asked
him
what
that
mad
fellow
had
wanted
and
his
evasive
answers
failing
to
satisfy
them
he
told
them
the
truth
they
at
once
raised
him
on
an
improvised
throne
and
caused
the
trumpets
to
proclaim
him
king
they
were
quite
ready
for
such
an
exploit
not
that
they
cared
in
the
least
for
that
mad
fellow
jehu
justified
their
confidence
by
his
astounding
mastery
in
treachery
and
bloodshed
but
he
placed
his
reliance
entirely
on
the
resources
of
his
own
talent
for
murder
he
was
not
borne
along
by
any
general
movement
against
the
dynasty
the
people
which
he
despised
x
stood
motionless
and
horrified
at
the
sight
of
the
crimes
which
came
so
quickly
one
after
another
even
a
hundred
years
afterwards
the
horror
at
the
massacre
of
jezreel
still
lived
hosea
i
the
crown
once
gained
the
reckless
player
showed
his
gratitude
to
the
fanatics
and
sent
the
priests
and
worshippers
of
baal
after
the
priests
of
jehovah
whom
he
had
slaughtered
along
with
all
belonging
to
the
royal
house
x
the
manner
in
which
he
led
them
into
the
snare
x
seq
shows
that
no
one
had
thought
before
this
of
regarding
him
as
the
champion
of
jehovah
and
even
at
this
time
his
zeal
was
manifestly
only
ostensible
he
was
not
fighting
for
an
idea
x
thus
we
see
that
baal
did
not
bring
about
the
fall
of
the
house
of
ahab
but
common
treason
the
zealots
employed
for
their
purposes
a
most
unholy
instrument
which
employed
them
in
turn
as
a
holy
instrument
for
its
purposes
they
did
not
succeed
in
rousing
the
people
to
a
storm
against
baal
far
from
it
the
execution
of
naboth
seems
to
have
excited
greater
indignation
it
was
a
crime
against
morals
not
against
religion
even
in
the
history
of
elijah
the
admission
is
made
that
this
struggle
against
baal
in
spite
of
his
sacrificial
victory
on
carmel
was
in
the
end
without
result
and
that
only
the
judicial
murder
of
naboth
brought
about
a
change
in
the
popular
sentiment
but
according
to
ix
this
murder
proved
a
momentous
event
not
because
it
led
as
we
should
expect
to
a
popular
agitation
but
from
the
fortuitous
circumstance
that
jehu
was
a
witness
of
the
scene
between
ahab
and
elijah
and
seemed
therefore
to
the
prophets
to
be
a
fit
person
to
carry
out
his
threatenings
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
the
grand
figure
of
elijah
could
not
have
been
drawn
as
we
have
it
except
from
the
impression
produced
by
a
real
character
but
it
is
too
much
torn
away
from
the
the
distance
of
the
narrator
is
not
so
very
great
in
point
of
time
from
the
events
he
deals
with
he
is
a
as
the
r
lyhwdh
of
xix
shows
this
may
also
be
gathered
from
xix
compared
with
deuteronomy
i
a
man
of
judah
could
not
easily
make
so
considerable
a
mistake
about
the
distance
though
we
have
to
remember
that
with
this
narrator
the
situation
of
horeb
can
scarcely
have
been
that
which
we
have
long
been
accustomed
to
assume
another
sign
of
antiquity
is
the
way
in
which
elijah
is
represented
as
combating
baal
in
israel
and
in
the
land
of
sidon
associating
with
the
worshippers
of
baal
on
the
most
friendly
terms
luke
iv
historical
position
it
belongs
to
and
is
thereby
magnified
to
colossal
proportions
it
may
be
said
of
this
class
of
narratives
generally
that
the
prophets
are
brought
too
much
into
the
foreground
in
them
as
if
they
had
been
even
in
their
lifetime
the
principal
force
of
israelite
history
and
as
if
the
influence
which
moved
them
had
ruled
and
pervaded
their
age
as
well
that
was
not
the
case
in
the
eyes
of
their
contemporaries
they
were
completely
overshadowed
by
the
kings
only
to
later
generations
did
they
become
the
principal
personages
they
were
important
ideally
and
influenced
the
future
rather
than
the
present
but
this
was
not
enough
a
real
tangible
importance
is
attributed
to
them
in
the
time
of
ahab
and
jehu
the
nebiim
were
a
widespread
body
and
organised
in
orders
of
their
own
but
were
not
highly
respected
the
average
of
them
were
miserable
fellows
who
ate
out
of
the
king
hand
and
were
treated
with
disdain
by
members
of
the
leading
classes
amos
of
tekoa
who
it
is
true
belonged
to
a
younger
generation
felt
it
an
insult
to
be
counted
one
of
them
elijah
and
elisha
rose
certainly
above
the
level
of
their
order
but
the
first
whose
hands
remained
pure
while
he
no
doubt
produced
a
great
impression
at
the
time
by
his
fearless
words
effected
nothing
against
the
king
and
quite
failed
to
draw
the
people
over
to
his
side
while
elisha
who
did
effect
something
made
use
of
means
which
could
not
bear
the
light
and
which
attest
rather
the
weakness
than
the
strength
of
prophecy
in
israel
let
us
conclude
by
summing
up
the
results
to
which
we
have
been
led
by
our
eclectic
pilgrimage
through
the
historical
books
what
in
the
common
view
appears
to
be
the
specific
character
of
israelite
history
and
has
chiefly
led
to
its
being
called
sacred
history
rests
for
the
most
part
on
a
later
of
the
original
picture
the
discolouring
influences
begin
early
i
do
not
reckon
among
these
the
entrance
of
mythical
elements
such
as
are
not
wanting
even
in
the
first
beginnings
to
which
we
can
trace
the
course
of
the
tradition
nor
the
inevitable
local
colour
which
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
tendency
i
think
only
of
that
uniform
stamp
impressed
on
the
tradition
by
men
who
regarded
history
exclusively
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
own
principles
here
we
observe
first
a
religious
influence
which
in
the
books
of
samuel
and
kings
turns
out
to
be
the
prophetical
one
the
view
appears
to
me
erroneous
that
it
is
to
the
prophets
that
the
hebrew
people
owe
their
history
as
a
whole
the
song
judges
though
perhaps
the
oldest
historical
monument
in
the
old
testament
can
not
be
cited
in
support
of
that
view
for
even
if
it
were
actually
composed
by
deborah
the
seer
stands
in
no
connection
with
the
prophets
least
of
all
can
the
colleges
of
the
nebiim
at
gilgal
and
other
places
be
regarded
as
nurseries
of
historic
tradition
the
products
which
are
to
be
traced
to
these
circles
betray
a
somewhat
narrow
field
of
vision
iv
the
prophets
did
not
form
the
tradition
at
first
but
came
after
shedding
upon
it
their
peculiar
light
their
interest
in
history
was
not
so
great
that
they
felt
it
necessary
to
write
it
down
they
only
infused
their
own
spirit
into
it
subsequently
but
the
systematic
recoining
of
the
tradition
was
only
effected
when
a
firmer
stamp
had
become
available
than
the
free
ideas
of
the
prophets
the
will
of
god
having
been
formulated
in
writing
when
this
point
was
reached
no
one
could
fail
to
see
the
discrepancy
between
the
ideal
commencement
which
was
now
sought
to
be
restored
as
it
stood
in
the
book
and
the
succeeding
development
the
old
books
of
the
people
which
spoke
in
the
most
innocent
way
of
the
most
objectionable
practices
and
institutions
had
to
be
thoroughly
remodelled
according
to
the
mosaic
form
in
order
to
make
them
valuable
digestible
and
edifying
for
the
new
generation
a
continuous
revision
of
them
was
made
not
only
in
the
chronicles
at
the
beginning
of
the
greek
domination
but
as
we
have
seen
in
this
chapter
even
in
the
babylonian
exile
the
style
of
the
latter
revision
differed
from
that
of
the
former
in
chronicles
the
past
is
remodelled
on
the
basis
of
the
law
transgressions
take
place
now
and
then
but
as
exceptions
from
the
rule
in
the
books
of
judges
samuel
and
kings
the
fact
of
the
radical
difference
of
the
old
practice
from
the
law
is
not
disputed
in
these
works
also
the
past
is
in
some
cases
remodelled
on
the
basis
of
the
ideal
but
as
a
rule
it
is
simply
condemned
that
is
one
difference
another
has
to
be
added
which
is
of
far
greater
importance
in
the
chronicles
the
pattern
according
to
which
the
history
of
ancient
israel
is
represented
is
the
pentateuch
the
priestly
code
in
the
source
of
chronicles
in
the
older
historical
books
the
revision
does
not
proceed
upon
the
basis
of
the
priestly
code
which
indeed
is
completely
unknown
to
them
but
on
the
basis
of
deuteronomy
thus
in
the
question
of
the
order
of
sequence
of
the
two
great
bodies
of
laws
the
history
of
the
tradition
leads
us
to
the
same
conclusion
as
the
history
of
the
cultus
chapter
viii
the
narrative
of
the
hexateuch
in
the
historical
books
the
tradition
is
developed
by
means
of
supplement
and
revision
double
narratives
occur
here
and
there
but
not
great
parallel
pieces
of
connected
matter
side
by
side
in
the
hexateuch
additions
and
supplements
have
certainly
taken
place
on
the
most
extensive
scale
but
the
significant
feature
is
here
that
continuous
narratives
which
can
and
must
be
understood
each
by
itself
are
woven
together
in
a
double
or
threefold
cord
critics
have
shown
a
disposition
if
not
in
principle
yet
in
fact
to
take
the
independence
of
these
sources
of
the
hexateuch
as
if
it
implied
that
in
point
of
matter
also
each
is
a
distinct
and
independent
source
but
this
is
even
very
improbable
even
in
the
case
of
the
prophets
who
received
their
word
from
the
lord
the
later
writer
knows
and
founds
upon
the
earlier
one
how
much
more
must
this
be
the
case
with
narrators
whose
express
business
is
with
the
tradition
criticism
has
not
done
its
work
when
it
has
completed
the
mechanical
distribution
it
must
aim
further
at
bringing
the
different
writings
when
thus
arranged
into
relation
with
each
other
must
seek
to
render
them
intelligible
as
phases
of
a
living
process
and
thus
to
make
it
possible
to
trace
a
graduated
development
of
the
tradition
the
striking
agreement
of
the
different
works
not
only
in
matter
but
in
their
arrangement
of
the
narratives
makes
the
office
of
criticism
as
now
described
not
less
but
more
necessary
there
is
no
primitive
legend
it
is
well
known
so
well
knit
as
the
biblical
one
and
thus
it
is
no
wonder
that
it
became
the
frame
for
many
others
and
infused
into
them
some
of
its
own
colour
this
connection
is
common
in
its
main
features
to
all
the
sources
alike
the
priestly
code
runs
as
to
its
historical
thread
quite
parallel
to
the
jehovist
history
this
alone
made
it
possible
to
interfuse
the
two
writings
as
we
now
have
them
in
the
pentateuch
that
this
was
not
done
altogether
without
violence
is
less
to
be
wondered
at
than
that
the
violence
which
was
done
is
so
small
and
particularly
that
the
structure
of
each
writing
is
left
almost
unimpaired
this
can
only
be
explained
from
the
intimate
agreement
of
the
two
works
in
point
of
plan
when
the
subject
treated
is
not
history
but
legends
about
times
the
arrangement
of
the
materials
does
not
come
with
the
materials
themselves
but
must
arise
out
of
the
plan
of
a
narrator
even
the
architecture
of
the
generations
which
forms
the
scaffolding
of
genesis
is
not
inseparably
bound
up
with
the
matters
to
be
disposed
of
in
it
from
the
mouth
of
the
people
there
comes
nothing
but
the
detached
narratives
which
may
or
may
not
happen
to
have
some
bearing
on
each
other
to
weave
them
together
in
a
connected
whole
is
the
work
of
the
poetical
or
literary
artist
thus
the
agreement
of
the
sources
in
the
plan
of
the
narrative
is
not
a
matter
of
course
but
a
matter
requiring
explanation
and
only
to
be
explained
on
the
ground
of
the
literary
dependence
of
one
source
on
the
other
the
question
how
this
relation
of
dependence
is
to
be
defined
is
thus
a
much
more
pressing
one
than
is
commonly
assumed
the
agreement
extends
not
only
to
the
thread
of
the
narrative
but
also
to
particulars
and
even
to
expressions
i
do
not
speak
of
flood
or
ark
but
the
following
examples
have
struck
me
q
genesis
vi
noah
is
said
to
be
in
his
in
j
e
vii
he
is
in
his
an
unusual
form
of
speech
which
gave
a
vast
amount
of
trouble
to
the
rabbins
and
to
jerome
similarly
q
genesis
xvii
son
whom
sarah
shall
bear
at
this
set
time
next
and
je
xviii
the
same
time
i
will
come
to
thee
again
next
year
and
then
sarah
shall
have
a
in
the
same
way
q
exodus
vi
vii
moses
am
of
uncircumcised
jehovah
i
make
thee
a
god
to
pharaoh
and
aaron
thy
brother
shall
be
thy
compared
with
je
iv
moses
am
slow
of
speech
and
of
a
slow
jehovah
shall
be
to
thee
instead
of
a
mouth
and
thou
shalt
be
to
him
instead
of
comp
genesis
xxvii
with
xxv
this
however
is
not
the
place
to
attempt
a
history
of
the
development
of
the
israelite
legend
we
are
only
to
lay
the
foundation
for
such
a
work
by
comparing
the
narrative
of
the
priestly
code
with
the
jehovistic
one
in
doing
so
we
shall
see
that
buttmann
mythologus
seq
is
right
in
asserting
against
de
wette
beitraege
ii
that
the
jehovistic
form
of
the
legend
is
the
earlier
of
the
two
the
line
indicated
by
buttmann
was
first
taken
up
again
by
th
noldeke
in
his
essay
on
the
of
the
pentateuch
which
opened
the
way
to
a
proper
estimate
of
the
narrative
part
of
the
work
the
bible
begins
with
the
account
of
the
priestly
code
of
the
creation
of
the
world
in
the
beginning
is
chaos
darkness
water
brooding
spirit
which
engenders
life
and
fertilises
the
dead
mass
the
primal
stuff
contains
in
itself
all
beings
as
yet
undistinguished
from
it
proceeds
step
by
step
the
ordered
world
by
a
process
of
unmixing
first
of
all
by
separating
out
the
great
elements
the
chaotic
primal
gloom
yields
to
the
contrast
of
light
and
darkness
the
primal
water
is
separated
by
the
vault
of
heaven
into
the
heavenly
water
out
of
which
there
grows
the
world
above
the
firmament
which
is
withdrawn
from
our
gaze
and
the
water
of
the
earth
the
latter
a
slimy
mixture
is
divided
into
land
and
sea
whereupon
the
land
at
once
puts
on
its
green
attire
the
elements
thus
brought
into
existence
light
heaven
water
land
are
then
enlivened
pretty
much
in
the
order
in
which
they
were
created
with
individual
beings
to
the
light
correspond
the
lamps
of
the
stars
fishes
to
the
water
to
the
heaven
the
birds
of
heaven
and
the
other
creatures
to
the
land
the
last
act
of
creation
is
markedly
emphasised
and
god
said
let
us
make
man
after
our
likeness
and
let
them
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
the
cattle
and
over
all
the
living
creatures
of
the
earth
and
over
every
creeping
thing
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
so
god
created
man
after
his
own
image
in
the
image
of
god
created
he
him
and
he
created
them
male
and
female
and
god
blessed
them
and
said
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
it
and
have
dominion
over
the
fish
of
the
sea
and
over
the
fowl
of
the
air
and
over
every
living
thing
that
moveth
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
god
said
behold
i
have
given
unto
you
every
herb
bearing
seed
which
is
upon
the
face
of
all
the
earth
and
every
tree
with
to
you
it
shall
be
for
food
and
to
every
beast
of
the
earth
and
to
every
fowl
of
the
air
and
to
everything
that
creepeth
upon
the
earth
wherein
there
is
life
i
have
given
the
green
herb
for
meat
thus
the
heavens
and
the
earth
were
made
and
all
the
host
of
them
and
on
the
seventh
day
god
ended
his
work
and
blessed
the
seventh
day
and
hallowed
it
genesis
i
it
is
commonly
said
that
the
aim
of
this
narrative
is
a
purely
religious
one
the
israelite
certainly
does
not
deny
himself
in
it
the
religious
spirit
with
which
it
is
penetrated
even
comes
at
some
points
into
conflict
with
the
nature
of
its
materials
the
notion
of
chaos
is
that
of
uncreated
matter
here
we
find
the
remarkable
idea
that
it
is
created
in
the
beginning
by
god
brooded
over
by
the
spirit
it
is
further
of
a
nature
for
development
to
take
place
out
of
it
and
the
trait
that
the
creation
is
represented
throughout
as
a
separation
of
elements
which
in
chaos
were
mixed
together
betrays
even
now
the
original
design
but
in
the
hebrew
narrative
the
immanent
spirit
has
yielded
to
the
transcendent
god
and
the
principle
of
evolution
is
put
aside
in
favour
of
the
fiat
of
creation
yet
for
all
this
the
aim
of
the
narrator
is
not
mainly
a
religious
one
had
he
only
meant
to
say
that
god
made
the
world
out
of
nothing
and
made
it
good
he
could
have
said
so
in
simpler
words
and
at
the
same
time
more
distinctly
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
means
to
describe
the
actual
course
of
the
genesis
of
the
world
and
to
be
true
to
nature
in
doing
so
he
means
to
give
a
cosmogonic
theory
whoever
denies
this
confounds
two
different
things
the
value
of
history
for
us
and
the
aim
of
the
writer
while
our
religious
views
are
or
seem
to
be
in
conformity
with
his
we
have
other
ideas
about
the
beginning
of
the
world
because
we
have
other
ideas
about
the
world
itself
and
see
in
the
heavens
no
vault
in
the
stars
no
lamps
nor
in
the
earth
the
foundation
of
the
universe
but
this
must
not
prevent
us
from
recognising
what
the
theoretical
aim
of
the
writer
of
genesis
really
was
he
seeks
to
deduce
things
as
they
are
from
each
other
he
asks
how
they
are
likely
to
have
issued
at
first
from
the
primal
matter
and
the
world
he
has
before
his
eyes
in
doing
this
is
not
a
mythical
world
but
the
present
and
ordinary
one
the
pale
colour
which
generally
marks
the
productions
of
the
earliest
reflection
about
nature
when
they
are
not
mythical
theories
is
characteristic
of
genesis
also
we
are
indeed
accustomed
to
regard
this
first
leaf
of
the
bible
as
surrounded
with
all
the
charm
that
can
be
derived
from
the
combination
of
high
antiquity
and
childlike
form
lt
would
be
vain
to
deny
the
exalted
ease
and
the
uniform
greatness
that
give
the
narrative
its
character
the
beginning
especially
is
incomparable
the
earth
was
without
form
and
void
and
darkness
lay
upon
the
deep
and
the
spirit
of
god
moved
upon
the
water
then
god
said
let
there
be
light
and
there
was
light
but
chaos
being
given
all
the
rest
is
spun
out
of
it
all
that
follows
is
reflection
systematic
construction
we
can
easily
follow
the
calculation
from
point
to
point
the
considerations
are
very
simple
which
lead
the
writer
to
make
first
what
is
great
appear
and
then
what
is
small
first
the
foundation
and
then
that
which
exists
upon
it
the
water
before
the
fishes
heaven
before
the
birds
of
heaven
land
and
plants
before
the
animals
the
arrangement
of
the
things
to
be
explained
stands
here
for
the
explanation
there
is
nothing
more
than
a
succession
which
proceeds
from
the
simple
to
the
complicated
there
is
no
effort
of
fancy
to
describe
the
process
more
closely
everywhere
cautious
consideration
which
shrinks
from
going
beyond
generalities
only
the
framework
of
creation
in
fact
is
given
it
is
not
filled
up
hence
also
the
form
of
the
whole
the
effect
of
which
can
not
be
reproduced
in
an
epitome
the
formula
gets
the
better
of
the
contents
and
instead
of
descriptions
our
ears
are
filled
with
logical
definitions
the
graduated
arrangement
in
separating
particular
things
out
of
chaos
indicates
the
awakening
of
a
natural
way
of
looking
at
nature
and
of
a
reasoned
reflection
about
natural
objects
just
as
this
is
manifest
in
the
attempts
of
thales
and
his
successors
which
are
also
remarkable
as
beginnings
of
the
theory
of
nature
and
of
an
objective
interest
in
the
things
of
the
outer
world
but
further
than
this
do
not
exactly
rouse
us
to
enthusiasm
there
is
nothing
whatever
in
the
piece
that
merits
the
name
of
invention
but
the
chronological
order
of
the
various
creations
buttmann
the
first
sentence
of
the
jehovistic
account
of
the
beginning
of
the
world
history
has
been
cut
off
by
the
reviser
it
was
all
a
dry
waste
when
jehovah
formed
the
earth
and
nowhere
did
the
green
herb
spring
up
for
jehovah
had
not
yet
caused
it
to
rain
upon
the
earth
and
there
was
not
a
man
to
till
the
ground
but
a
mist
went
up
out
of
the
earth
and
watered
the
face
of
the
ground
and
jehovah
formed
man
of
the
dust
of
the
ground
and
breathed
into
his
nostrils
the
breath
of
life
then
he
planted
a
garden
far
to
the
eastward
in
eden
in
the
place
where
the
four
chief
rivers
of
the
earth
part
asunder
from
their
common
source
there
grow
among
other
fine
trees
the
tree
of
life
and
the
tree
of
knowledge
in
this
garden
jehovah
placed
the
man
to
dress
it
and
keep
it
and
to
eat
of
all
the
trees
forbidding
him
to
eat
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
only
but
the
man
is
utterly
alone
in
his
garden
he
must
have
company
that
is
suitable
for
him
so
jehovah
first
forms
the
beasts
if
perchance
the
man
will
associate
with
them
and
make
friends
with
them
he
brings
them
to
him
one
after
another
to
see
what
impression
they
make
on
him
and
what
the
man
will
call
them
he
calls
them
by
their
right
names
ox
ass
bear
thus
expressing
his
feeling
that
he
finds
in
them
nothing
relate
to
himself
and
jehovah
has
to
seek
other
counsel
then
he
forms
the
woman
out
of
a
rib
of
the
sleeping
man
and
causes
him
to
awake
wearied
as
it
were
by
all
the
fruitless
experiments
with
the
beasts
the
man
cries
out
delighted
when
he
looks
at
the
woman
this
surely
is
flesh
of
my
flesh
and
bone
of
my
bone
she
may
be
called
thus
the
scene
is
drawn
the
persons
introduced
and
an
action
secretly
prepared
now
the
tragedy
begins
which
ends
with
the
expulsion
of
man
from
the
garden
seduced
by
the
serpent
man
stretches
out
his
hand
after
the
food
which
is
forbidden
him
in
order
to
become
like
god
and
eats
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
the
first
consequence
of
this
is
the
beginning
of
dress
the
first
step
in
civilisation
other
and
sadder
consequences
soon
follow
in
the
evening
the
man
and
his
wife
hear
jehovah
walking
in
the
garden
they
hide
before
him
and
by
doing
so
betray
themselves
it
is
useless
to
think
of
denying
what
has
taken
place
and
as
each
of
them
puts
the
blame
on
the
other
they
show
themselves
one
after
the
other
to
be
guilty
the
sentence
of
the
judge
concludes
the
investigation
the
serpent
is
to
creep
on
its
belly
to
eat
dust
and
to
perish
in
the
unequal
contest
with
man
the
woman
is
to
bear
many
children
with
sorrow
and
to
long
for
the
man
who
yet
will
be
her
tyrant
the
principal
curse
is
directed
against
the
man
cursed
be
the
ground
for
thy
sake
in
sorrow
shalt
thou
eat
of
it
all
the
days
of
thy
life
thorns
also
and
thistles
shall
it
bring
forth
to
thee
and
thou
shalt
eat
the
herb
of
the
field
till
thou
return
unto
the
ground
for
out
of
it
wast
thou
taken
for
dust
thou
art
and
unto
dust
shalt
thou
return
sentence
being
thus
spoken
jehovah
prepares
the
man
and
woman
for
their
future
life
by
making
coats
of
skins
to
dress
them
with
then
turning
to
his
celestial
company
behold
he
says
the
man
is
become
like
one
of
us
to
know
good
and
evil
and
now
lest
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
take
also
of
the
tree
of
life
and
eat
and
live
for
ever
with
these
words
he
drives
man
out
of
paradise
and
places
before
it
the
cherubs
and
the
flaming
sword
which
turns
every
way
to
keep
the
way
of
the
tree
of
life
genesis
i
the
gloomiest
view
of
life
as
it
now
is
lies
at
the
root
of
this
story
man
days
are
mere
hardship
and
labour
and
a
with
no
prospect
of
relief
for
the
only
reward
of
it
is
that
he
returns
to
the
earth
from
which
he
was
taken
no
thought
appears
of
any
life
after
death
and
life
without
death
might
have
been
but
has
been
forfeited
now
the
cherub
guards
the
approach
to
the
tree
of
life
of
which
man
might
have
eaten
when
in
paradise
but
did
not
this
actual
cheerless
lot
of
man
upon
the
earth
is
the
real
problem
of
the
story
it
is
felt
to
be
the
very
opposite
of
our
true
destiny
at
first
things
must
have
been
otherwise
man
lot
now
is
a
perversion
of
what
it
was
at
first
it
is
the
punishment
of
primeval
guilt
now
resting
on
us
all
at
first
man
lived
in
paradise
he
had
a
happy
existence
and
one
worthy
of
his
nature
and
held
familiar
intercourse
with
jehovah
it
was
his
forbidden
striving
after
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
that
drove
him
out
of
paradise
and
brought
all
his
miseries
upon
him
what
is
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
the
commentators
say
it
is
the
faculty
of
moral
distinction
conscience
in
fact
they
assume
accordingly
that
man
was
in
paradise
morally
indifferent
in
a
state
which
allowed
of
no
action
and
could
not
be
called
either
good
or
evil
a
state
like
this
not
being
an
ideal
one
some
of
them
consider
that
man
gained
more
than
he
lost
by
the
fall
while
others
admit
that
it
could
not
be
the
divine
intention
to
keep
him
always
at
this
stage
of
childish
irresponsibility
and
that
this
can
not
be
the
view
of
the
narrator
either
but
it
is
plain
that
the
narrator
is
not
speaking
of
a
relative
prohibition
of
knowledge
but
an
absolute
one
he
means
that
it
is
only
for
god
and
that
when
man
stretches
out
his
hand
towards
it
he
is
transcending
his
limits
and
seeking
to
be
as
god
on
the
other
side
he
can
not
of
course
mean
to
say
that
conscience
is
a
doubtful
blessing
and
its
possession
to
be
deplored
or
that
it
is
a
thing
that
god
in
fact
refuses
to
men
and
reserves
to
himself
alone
the
knowledge
spoken
of
can
not
be
moral
knowledge
what
could
the
assertion
mean
that
god
would
have
no
one
but
himself
know
the
difference
between
good
and
evil
and
would
deny
to
man
this
knowledge
one
would
think
that
conscience
is
a
thing
belonging
specifically
to
man
and
not
to
god
and
what
could
be
the
sense
of
representing
adam
and
eve
as
so
intent
to
know
what
was
sin
and
what
was
virtue
no
one
is
curious
about
that
and
sin
never
came
into
existence
in
the
way
of
ethical
experiment
by
men
desiring
to
know
what
it
is
and
it
is
manifestly
assumed
that
men
knew
in
paradise
that
obedience
to
jehovah
was
good
and
disobedience
evil
and
finally
it
conflicts
with
the
common
tradition
of
all
peoples
to
represent
the
first
man
as
a
sort
of
beast
he
is
regarded
as
undeveloped
only
in
point
of
outward
culture
the
knowledge
which
is
here
forbidden
is
rather
knowledge
as
such
general
knowledge
or
getting
the
eyes
opened
as
it
is
afterwards
called
this
is
what
transcends
in
the
writer
view
the
limits
of
our
nature
prying
out
the
secret
of
things
the
secret
of
the
world
and
overlooking
as
it
were
god
hand
to
see
how
he
goes
to
work
in
his
living
activity
so
as
perhaps
to
learn
his
secret
and
imitate
him
for
knowledge
is
to
the
ancient
world
also
power
and
no
mere
metaphysic
this
knowing
in
the
highest
sense
is
the
attribute
of
god
alone
who
stands
in
the
creative
centre
of
things
and
penetrates
and
surveys
the
whole
it
is
sealed
to
man
who
has
to
labour
and
weary
himself
at
little
things
and
yet
the
forbidden
good
has
the
most
powerful
attraction
for
him
he
burns
to
possess
it
and
instead
of
resigning
himself
in
trust
and
reverence
he
seeks
to
steal
the
jewel
which
is
jealously
guarded
from
him
and
so
to
become
like
god
to
his
own
sorrow
this
explanation
is
not
new
it
is
the
old
and
popular
one
for
which
reason
also
goethe
adopted
it
in
faust
one
objection
certainly
may
be
taken
to
it
the
words
are
not
merely
but
of
good
and
but
good
and
evil
in
hebrew
mean
primarily
nothing
more
than
salutary
and
hurtful
the
application
of
the
words
to
virtue
and
sin
is
a
secondary
one
these
being
regarded
as
serviceable
or
hurtful
in
their
effects
good
and
evil
as
spoken
of
in
genesis
ii
iii
point
to
no
contrast
of
some
actions
with
others
according
to
their
moral
distinctions
the
phrase
is
only
a
comprehensive
one
for
things
generally
according
to
the
contradictory
attributes
which
constitute
their
interest
to
man
as
they
help
or
injure
him
for
as
said
he
desires
to
know
not
what
things
are
metaphysically
but
what
is
the
use
of
them
besides

expression

and
it
must
also
be
remarked
that
the
phrase
is
not
know
the
good
and
the
evil
but
know
good
and
evil
but
more
we
must
regard
this
knowledge
not
as
it
affects
the
individual
but
in
the
light
of
history
what
is
meant
is
what
we
call
civilisation
as
the
human
race
goes
forward
in
civilisation
it
goes
backward
in
the
fear
of
god
the
first
step
in
civilisation
is
clothing
and
here
this
is
the
first
result

in

this
we
have
the
steps
of
emancipation
with
his
growing
civilisation
grows
also
his
alienation
from
the

good
and
this
is
evidently
the
idea
though
it
is
not
stated
the
restless

never
reaches
its
goal
after
all
it
is
a
the

which

the

symbol
for
it
the
strain
is
that
strain
of
unsatisfied
longing
which
is
to
be
heard
among
all
peoples
on
attaining
to
civilisation
they
become
aware
of
the
value
of
those
blessings
which
they
have
sacrificed
for
it
dillmann
thinks
this
idea
insipid
genesis
it
was
necessary
to
discuss
the
notion
of
knowledge
at
some
length
because
the
misunderstanding
of
this
point
on
the
part
of
philosophers
and
theologians
has
cast
over
our
story
an
appearance
of
modernness
which
has
in
its
turn
done
something
to
influence
general
opinion
as
to
the
age
of
this
story
compared
with
the
other
having
got

of
this
impression
we

the

shine
by
the
absence

comes
to
the
conclusion
that
the
first
man
was
hermaphrodite
in

stand
before
the
first
beginnings
of
sober
reflection
about
nature
in

we
are
on
the

and
myth
where
reflection
found
its
materials
we
do
not
think
of
asking
ordinary
contemplation
of
things
could
furnish
it
but
the
materials
for
myth
could
not
be
derived
from
contemplation
at
least
so
far
as
regards
the
view
of
nature
which
is
chiefly
before
us
here
they
came
from
the
traditions
of
the
old
world
of
western
asia
here
we
are
in
the
enchanted
garden
of
the
ideas
of
genuine
antiquity
the
fresh
early
smell
of
earth
meets
us
on
the
breeze
the
hebrews
breathed
the
air
which
surrounded
them
the
stories
they
told
on
the
jordan
of
the
land
of
eden
and
the
fall
were
told
in
the
same
way
on
the
euphrates
and
the
tigris
on
the
oxus
and
the
arius
the
true
land
of
the
world
where
dwells
the
deity
is
eden
it
was
not
removed
from
the
earth
after
the
fall
it
is
there
still
else
whence
the
need
of
cherubs
to
guard
the
access
to
it
the
rivers
that
proceed
from
it
are
real
rivers
all
well
known
to
the
narrator
they
and
the
countries
they
flow
through
and
the
products
that
come
from
these
countries
three
of
them
the
nile
the
euphrates
and
the
tigris
are
well
known
to
us
also
and
if
we
only
knew
how
the
narrator
conceived
their
courses
to
lie
it
would
be
easy
to
determine
the
position
of
their
common
source
and
the
situation
of
paradise
other
peoples
of
antiquity
define
the
situation
of
their
holy
land
in
a
similar
manner
the
streams
have
different
names
but
the
thing
is
the
same
the
wonderful
trees
also
in
the
garden
of
eden
have
many
analogies
even
in
the
germanic
mythology
the
belief
in
the
cherubs
which
guard
paradise
is
also
widely
diffused
is
perhaps
the
same
name
and
certainly
represents
the
same
idea
as
in
greek
and
in
german
we
find
everywhere
these
beings
wonderfully
compounded
out
of
lion
eagle
and
man
they
are
everywhere
guardians
of
the
divine
and
sacred
and
then
also
of
gold
and
of
treasures
the
ingredients
of
the
story
seem
certainly
to
have
parted
with
some
of
their
original
colour
under
the
influence
of
monotheism
the
hebrew
people
no
doubt
had
something
more
to
tell
about
the
tree
of
life
than
now
appears
it
is
said
to
have
been
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
and
so
it
seems
to
have
stood
at
the
point
whence
the
four
streams
issued
at
the
fountain
of
life
which
was
so
important
to
the
faith
of
the
east
and
which
alexander
marched
out
to
discover
paradise
moreover
was
certainly
not
planted
originally
for
man
it
was
the
dwelling
of
the
deity
himself
traces
of
this
may
still
be
recognised
jehovah
does
not
descend
to
it
from
heaven
but
goes
out
walking
in
the
garden
in
the
evening
as
if
he
were
at
home
the
garden
of
deity
is
however
on
the
whole
somewhat
naturalised
a
similar
weakening
down
of
the
mythic
element
is
apparent
in
the
matter
of
the
serpent
it
is
not
seen
at
once
that
the
serpent
is
a
demon
yet
parting
with
these
foreign
elements
has
made
the
story
no
poorer
and
it
has
gained
in
noble
simplicity
the
mythic
background
gives
it
a
tremulous
brightness
we
feel
that
we
are
in
the
golden
age
when
heaven
was
still
on
earth
and
yet
unintelligible
enchantment
is
avoided
and
the
limit
of
a
sober
chiaroscuro
is
not
transgressed
the
story
of
the
creation
in
six
days
played
we
know
a
great
part
in
the
earlier
stages
of
cosmological
and
geological
science
it
is
not
by
chance
that
natural
science
has
kept
off
genesis
ii
iii
there
is
scarcely
any
nature
there
but
poetry
has
at
all
times
inclined
to
the
story
of
paradise
now
we
do
not
require
to
ask
at
this
time
of
day
nor
to
argue
the
question
whether
mythic
poetry
or
sober
prose
is
the
earlier
stage
in
the
contemplation
of
the
world
intimately
connected
with
the
advanced
views
of
nature
which
we
find
in
genesis
is
the
purified
notion
of
god
found
there
the
most
important
point
is
that
a
special
word
is
employed
which
stands
for
nothing
else
than
the
creative
agency
of
god
and
so
dissociates
it
from
all
analogy
with
human
making
and
shaping
a
word
of
such
exclusive
significance
that
it
can
not
be
reproduced
either
in
latin
or
in
greek
or
in
german
in
a
youthful
people
such
a
theological
abstraction
is
unheard
of
and
so
with
the
hebrews
we
find
both
the
word
and
the
notion
only
coming
into
use
after
the
babylonian
exile
they
appear
along
with
the
emphatic
statement
of
the
creative
omnipotence
of
jehovah
with
reference
to
nature
which
makes
its
appearance
we
may
say
suddenly
in
the
literature
of
the
exile
plays
a
great
part
in
the
book
of
job
and
frequently
presents
itself
in
isaiah
in
genesis
ii
not
nature
but
man
is
the
beginning
of
the
world
and
of
history
whether
a
creation
out
of
nothing
is
assumed
there
at
all
is
a
question
which
only
the
mutilation
of
the
commencement
before
ii
makes
it
not
quite
impossible
to
answer
in
the
affirmative
at
any
rate
it
is
not
the
case
here
that
the
command
of
the
creator
sets
things
in
motion
at
the
first
so
that
they
develop
themselves
to
separate
species
out
of
the
universal
chaos
jehovah
himself
puts
his
hand
to
the
work
and
this
supposes
that
the
world
in
its
main
features
was
already
in
existence
he
plants
and
waters
the
garden
he
forms
man
and
breathes
life
into
his
nostrils
he
builds
the
woman
out
of
the
man
rib
having
made
a
previous
attempt
which
was
unsuccessful
to
provide
him
with
company
the
beasts
are
living
witnesses
of
the
failure
of
his
experiments
in
other
respects
too
he
proceeds
like
a
man
in
the
evening
when
it
grows
cool
he
goes
to
walk
in
the
garden
and
when
there
discovers
by
chance
the
transgression
which
has
taken
place
and
holds
an
investigation
in
which
he
makes
not
the
least
use
of
his
omniscience
and
when
he
says
behold
the
man
is
become
like
one
of
us
to
know
good
and
evil
and
now
lest
he
stretch
forth
his
hand
and
take
of
the
tree
of
life
and
eat
and
live
for
ever
that
is
not
said
in
irony
any
more
than
when
he
expresses
himself
on
the
occasion
of
the
building
of
babel
behold
the
people
is
one
and
they
have
all
one
language
and
this
is
only
the
beginning
of
their
doings
and
now
nothing
will
be
too
difficult
for
them
that
they
have
imagined
to
do
go
to
let
us
go
down
and
confound
their
language
that
at
the
same
time
the
majesty
of
jehovah
is
in
no
way
compromised
is
the
mystery
of
poetic
genius
how
would
the
colourless
god
of
abstraction
fare
in
such
a
situation
the
treatment
finally
of
the
microcosm
in
the
two
accounts
reflects
the
difference
between
them
in
chapter
man
is
directed
at
the
very
outset
to
the
ground
on
which
he
moves
to
this
day
replenish
the
earth
and
subdue
it
he
is
told
a
perfectly
natural
task
in
chaps
ii
iii
he
is
placed
in
paradise
and
his
sphere
of
activity
there
nestled
as
he
may
be
said
still
to
be
in
the
lap
of
the
deity
is
very
limited
the
circumstances
of
his
life
as
it
now
is
the
man
toil
in
the
fields
the
woman
toil
in
bearing
children
do
not
answer
to
his
original
destiny
they
are
not
a
blessing
but
a
curse
in
the
jehovistic
narrative
man
is
as
wonderful
to
himself
as
the
external
world
in
the
other
he
is
as
much
a
matter
of
course
as
it
is
in
the
one
he
sees
astonishing
mysteries
in
the
difference
of
the
sexes
in
marriage
in
iv
in
the
other
these
are
physiological
facts
which
raise
no
questions
or
reflections
he
made
them
male
and
female
and
said
be
fruitful
and
multiply
there
his
attitude
towards
the
beasts
is
one
of
mixed
familiarity
and
bewilderment
he
does
not
know
exactly
what
to
make
of
them
they
are
allied
to
him
and
yet
not
quite
suitable
society
for
him
here
they
are
beings
not
related
to
him
over
which
he
rules
the
chief
point
in
which
the
difference
between
the
two
accounts
comes
to
a
head
is
this
in
genesis
ii
man
is
virtually
forbidden
to
lift
the
veil
of
things
and
to
know
the
world
represented
in
the
tree
of
knowledge
in
genesis
this
is
the
task
set
him
from
the
beginning
he
is
to
rule
over
the
whole
earth
and
rule
and
knowledge
come
to
the
same
thing
they
mean
civilisation
there
nature
is
to
him
a
sacred
mystery
here
it
is
a
mere
fact
an
object
he
is
no
longer
bewildered
over
against
nature
but
free
and
superior
there
it
is
a
robbery
for
man
to
seek
to
be
equal
with
god
here
god
makes
him
at
first
in
his
own
image
and
after
his
own
likeness
and
appoints
him
his
representative
in
the
realm
of
nature
we
can
not
regard
it
as
fortuitous
that
in
this
point
genesis
asserts
the
opposite
of
genesis
ii
iii
the
words
spoken
with
such
emphasis
and
repeated
i
ix
sound
exactly
like
a
protest
against
the
view
underlying
genesis
ii
a
protest
to
be
explained
partly
by
the
growth
of
moral
and
religious
cultivation
but
partly
also
no
doubt
due
to
the
convulsive
efforts
of
later
judaism
to
deny
that
most
firmly
established
of
all
the
lessons
of
history
that
the
sons
suffer
for
the
sins
of
the
fathers
a
coarser
counterpart
to
genesis
ii
iii
is
genesis
vi
here
also
there
is
a
kind
of
fall
of
man
in
an
attempt
to
overpass
the
boundary
between
the
human
race
and
the
divine
in
the
priestly
narrative
q
the
gulf
between
spirit
which
is
divine
substance
and
flesh
which
is
human
substance
is
bridged
over
by
the
doctrine
of
man
creation
in
the
image
of
god
what
are
generally
cited
as
points
of
superiority
in
genesis
over
genesis
ii
iii
are
beyond
doubt
signs
of
progress
in
outward
culture
the
mental
individuality
of
the
two
writers
the
systematiser
and
the
genius
can
not
be
compared
and
the
difference
in
this
respect
tells
nothing
of
their
respective
dates
but
in
its
general
views
of
god
nature
and
man
genesis
stands
on
a
higher
certainly
on
a
later
level
to
our
way
of
thinking
its
views
are
more
intelligible
simpler
more
natural
and
on
this
account
they
have
been
held
to
be
also
older
but
this
is
on
the
one
hand
to
identify
naturalness
with
originality
two
things
which
every
one
knows
not
to
be
the
same
and
on
the
other
hand
it
is
applying
a
standard
to
prehistoric
tradition
which
applies
to
historical
tradition
only
freedom
from
miracle
and
myth
count
in
favour
of
the
latter
but
not
of
the
former
but
the
secret
root
of
the
manifest
preference
long
shown
by
theology
for
genesis
appears
to
lie
in
this
that
scholars
felt
themselves
responsible
for
what
the
bible
says
and
therefore
liked
it
to
come
as
little
as
possible
in
conflict
with
general
culture
i
merely
assert
that
genesis
ii
iii
is
prior
to
genesis
i
do
not
believe
the
story
of
paradise
and
of
the
fall
to
be
very
old
with
the
israelites
we
are
led
to
think
so
by
the
fact
that
the
man
and
the
woman
stand
at
the
head
of
the
genealogy
of
the
human
race
a
place
we
should
rather
expect
to
be
assigned
to
the
serpent
according
to
primitive
semitic
belief
the
serpent
was
by
no
means
opposed
to
god
this
is
the
case
in
the
chronicon
edessenum
and
in
abyssinian
legend
and
a
trace
of
this
is
perhaps
preserved
in
the
name
of
eve
as
noldeke
thinks
the
name
certainly
receives
this
interpretation
in
philo
de
agric
noe
and
in
the
midrash
rabba
on
genesis
iii
z
moreover
the
true
seat
of
god
to
the
hebrews
was
mount
sinai
and
the
original
hebrew
life
was
the
nomadic
life
of
the
patriarchs
not
gardening
or
agriculture
and
finally
we
can
not
believe
barbarians
to
have
indulged
in
reflections
on
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
civilisation
the
materials
of
genesis
ii
iii
can
hardly
have
been
imported
before
the
time
of
solomon
where
they
came
from
we
can
scarcely
guess
it
would
be
most
natural
to
think
of
the
phoenicians
or
the
canaanites
generally
and
this
theory
is
favoured
by
genesis
iv
but
in
je
babel
is
regarded
as
the
last
home
of
the
primitive
human
race
eden
and
nod
having
preceded
it
and
the
hebrews
probably
derived
the
legend
in
the
last
instance
from
babylon
but
this
does
not
prove
that
this
or
that
parallel
brought
forward
by
assyriologists
is
necessarily
of
value
after
the
beginning
of
the
world
we
have
in
genesis
both
in
the
priestly
code
and
in
the
jehovist
the
transition
from
adam
to
noah
chapters
iv
then
the
flood
then
the
transition
from
noah
to
abraham
chapters
x
in
the
dry
names
which
are
enumerated
in
genesis
and
genesis
iv
buttmann
recognised
the
remains
of
an
historical
connection
once
woven
together
out
of
primitive
stories
these
narratives
were
evidently
mythological
their
original
contents
are
destroyed
both
in
genesis
q
and
in
genesis
iv
je
but
only
the
list
of
the
jehovist
now
bears
the
appearance
of
a
ruin
in
the
other
the
fragments
have
been
used
for
a
careful
new
building
in
which
they
no
longer
look
like
fragments
here
they
are
made
to
serve
as
the
pillars
of
a
chronology
which
descends
from
adam
to
moses
computing
the
period
from
the
one
to
the
other
as
years
these
years
represent
generations
of
a
hundred
years
each
namely
adam
to
abraham
isaac
jacob
levi
kohath
amram
aaron
the
last
of
a
generation
is
eleazar
who
was
a
man
of
mature
years
at
the
time
of
the
exodus
so
noldeke
in
the
jahrbb
fuer
protest
genesis
xv
expressly
states
that
the
generation
is
reckoned
as
years
in
this
period
such
a
chronology
is
totally
at
variance
with
the
simplicity
of
the
legend
it
is
also
evident
that
if
even
in
the
case
of
the
exact
chronological
dates
are
a
sure
sign
of
later
working
up
of
old
poetical
legends
buttmann
historical
books
the
systematic
chronology
is
no
older
than
the
period
of
the
exile
that
of
the
pentateuch
must
be
of
still
later
origin
for
the
historical
period
there
were
certain
fixed
points
for
chronology
to
lay
hold
of
it
can
not
have
begun
with
the
patriarchs
and
gone
on
to
the
kings
it
must
have
begun
with
the
kings
and
then
gone
higher
up
to
the
patriarchs
it
must
have
begun
at
the
lower
end
where
alone
it
had
any
firm
ground
to
stand
on
the
belief
that
the
men
of
the
early
world
lived
to
a
great
age
is
no
doubt
old
but
the
settled
chronology
based
on
the
years
in
which
each
patriarch
begat
his
son
is
an
artifice
in
which
we
manifestly
see
the
doctrinaire
treatment
of
history
which
was
coming
into
vogue
for
later
periods
attempting
to
lay
hold
of
the
earliest
legends
as
well
only
when
the
living
contents
of
the
legend
had
completely
disappeared
could
its
skeleton
be
used
as
a
framework
of
chronology
buttmann
has
also
shown
that
the
elements
of
the
genealogy
of
q
genesis
and
of
the
of
je
genesis
iv
are
identical
in
q
noah
comes
after
lamech
at
the
end
and
at
the
beginning
adam
cain
is
doubled
and
becomes
adam
seth
enos
cainan
adam
and
enos
being
synonymous
this
amounts
to
adam
seth
adam
cainan
that
is
to
say
adam
seth
are
prefixed
and
the
series
begins
anew
with
enos
cainan
just
as
in
je
the
priestly
code
itself
offers
a
remarkable
testimony
to
the
superior
originality
of
the
jehovist
genealogy
by
ascribing
to
lamech
here
the
ninth
in
order
the
age
of
years
this
can
only
be
explained
from
je
where
lamech
is
seventh
in
order
and
moreover
specially
connects
himself
with
the
number
seven
by
his
speech
cain
is
avenged
seven
times
and
lamech
seventy
times
seven
another
circumstance
shows
q
to
be
posterior
to
the
first
man
is
called
here
not
ha
adam
as
in
je
but
always
adam
without
the
article
a
difference
which
kuenen
pertinently
compares
with
that
between
ho
xristos
and
xristos
but
in
q
itself
genesis
i
the
first
man
is
only
the
generic
man
if
in
spite
of
this
he
is
called
simply
adam
genesis
as
if
that
were
his
proper
name
the
only
way
to
account
for
this
is
to
suppose
a
reminiscence
of
genesis
ii
though
here
the
personification
does
not
as
yet
extend
to
the
name
we
come
to
the
story
of
the
flood
genesis
in
je
the
flood
is
well
led
up
to
in
q
we
should
be
inclined
to
ask
in
surprise
how
the
earth
has
come
all
at
once
to
be
so
corrupted
after
being
so
far
in
the
best
of
order
did
we
not
know
from
je
in
omitting
the
fall
the
fratricide
of
cain
the
of
lamech
the
intercourse
of
the
sons
of
god
with
the
daughters
of
men
and
parting
with
the
distinctive
gloomy
colouring
which
is
unmistakably
spread
over
the
whole
early
history
of
man
in
je
the
priestly
code
has
entirely
lost
the
preparation
for
the
flood
which
now
appears
in
the
most
abrupt
and
unaccountable
way
as
to
the
contents
of
the
story
the
priestly
version
here
agrees
to
an
unusual
extent
with
the
jehovistic
one
differing
from
it
chiefly
in
the
artificial
mathematical
marking
out
of
the
framework
the
flood
lasts
twelve
months
and
ten
days
exactly
a
solar
year
it
begins
in
the
six
hundredth
year
of
noah
on
the
seventeenth
of
the
second
month
rises
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
days
and
begins
to
fall
on
the
seventeenth
of
the
seventh
month
on
the
first
month
the
tops
of
the
mountains
become
visible
in
the
six
hundred
and
first
year
on
the
first
of
the
first
month
the
water
has
abated
on
the
of
the
second
month
the
earth
is
dry
god
himself
gives
instructions
and
measurements
for
the
building
of
the
ark
as
for
the
tabernacle
it
is
to
be
three
stories
high
and
divided
throughout
into
small
compartments
three
hundred
cubits
long
fifty
cubits
broad
thirty
cubits
high
and
noah
is
to
make
it
accurately
according
to
the
cubit
when
the
water
is
at
its
height
on
the
seventeenth
of
the
second
month
the
flood
is
fifteen
cubits
above
the
highest
mountains
noah
having
apparently
not
forgotten
in
spite
of
his
anxiety
to
heave
the
lead
and
to
mark
the
date
in
his
this
prematurely
modern
measuring
and
counting
can
not
be
thought
by
any
one
to
make
the
narrative
more
lifelike
it
simply
destroys
the
illusion
all
that
is
idyllic
and
naive
is
consistently
stripped
off
the
legend
as
far
as
possible
as
the
duration
of
the
flood
is
advanced
from
forty
days
je
to
a
whole
year
its
area
also
is
immeasurably
increased
the
priestly
code
states
with
particular
emphasis
that
it
was
quite
universal
and
went
over
the
tops
of
the
highest
mountains
indeed
it
is
compelled
to
take
this
view
by
its
assumption
that
the
human
race
was
diffused
from
the
first
over
the
whole
earth
such
traits
as
the
missions
of
the
birds
and
the
are
passed
over
poetic
legend
is
smoothed
down
into
historic
prose
but
the
value
and
the
charm
of
the
story
depend
on
such
little
traits
as
these
they
are
not
mere
incidents
to
poetry
they
are
the
most
important
thing
of
all
these
are
the
features
which
are
found
just
in
the
same
way
in
the
babylonian
story
of
the
flood
and
if
the
jehovist
has
a
much
greater
affinity
with
the
babylonian
story
than
the
priestly
code
that
shows
it
to
have
preserved
more
faithfully
the
international
character
of
those
early
legends
this
appears
most
plainly
in
his
accounting
for
the
flood
by
the
confounding
of
the
boundaries
between
spirit
and
flesh
and
the
intercourse
of
the
sons
of
god
and
the
daughters
of
men
the
jehovist
here
gives
us
a
piece
but
little
adulterated
of
mythical
heathenism
a
thing
quite
inconceivable
in
q
the
priestly
code
has
the
rainbow
which
the
jehovist
as
we
now
have
him
wants
but
we
have
to
remember
that
in
genesis
the
jehovist
account
is
mutilated
but
the
priestly
one
preserved
entire
if
the
rainbow
occurred
both
in
je
and
in
q
one
of
the
accounts
of
it
had
to
be
omitted
and
according
to
the
usual
procedure
the
omission
had
to
be
from
je
it
is
accordingly
very
possible
that
it
was
not
at
first
wanting
in
je
it
agrees
better
indeed
with
the
simple
rain
which
here
brings
about
the
flood
than
with
the
opening
of
the
sluices
of
heaven
and
the
fountains
of
the
deep
which
produce
it
in
q
and
it
would
stand
much
better
after
viii
than
after
ix
in
the
priestly
code
moreover
the
meaning
of
the
rainbow
is
half
obliterated
on
the
one
hand
the
story
is
clumsily
turned
into
history
and
we
receive
the
impression
either
that
the
rainbow
only
appeared
in
the
heavens
at
this
one
time
after
the
flood
or
that
it
had
been
there
ever
since
on
the
other
hand
it
is
made
the
token
of
the
covenant
between
elohim
and
noah
and
the
use
of
language
in
other
passages
with
the
analogy
of
genesis
would
point
to
the
covenant
described
in
ix
the
rainbow
would
then
be
the
counterpart
of
circumcision
the
covenant
the
celestial
bow
is
originally
the
instrument
of
the
god
and
therefore
a
symbol
of
his
hostility
but
he
lays
it
out
of
his
hand
to
signify
that
he
has
laid
aside
his
wrath
and
it
is
a
token
of
his
reconciliation
and
favour
when
there
has
been
such
a
storm
that
one
might
dread
a
repetition
of
the
flood
the
rainbow
appears
in
heaven
the
sun
and
grace
breaking
forth
again
in
the
q
t
has
not
the
meaning
of
a
mere
arc
it
always
means
the
and
what
is
most
important
of
all
the
arabs
also
always
take
the
iris
to
be
the
of
god
kuzah
shoots
arrows
from
his
bow
and
then
hangs
it
up
in
the
clouds
z
with
the
jews
and
their
kin
the
rainbow
has
retained
far
into
christian
times
a
remarkably
near
relation
to
the
deity
it
is
singular
that
the
edomites
have
a
god
named
kaus
as
well
as
kuzah
the
law
of
ch
ix
a
modification
of
the
first
ordinance
given
to
adam
for
the
world
after
the
flood
which
still
subsists
is
for
the
priestly
code
the
crown
the
end
the
substance
of
the
whole
narrative
its
interest
in
the
law
always
completely
absorbs
the
simple
interest
of
its
story
we
have
also
to
remark
that
in
this
source
vengeance
for
the
spilling
of
blood
is
not
the
affair
of
the
relatives
but
the
affair
of
god
and
that
it
is
demanded
for
man
as
man
whether
master
or
slave
and
no
money
compensation
allowed
the
words
sound
simple
and
solemn
whoso
sheddeth
man
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed
for
in
the
image
of
god
made
he
man
yet
the
religious
notion
of
humanity
underlying
this
sentence
is
not
ancient
with
the
hebrews
any
more
than
with
other
nations
cf
genesis
iv
and
exodus
xxi
seq
de
wette
beitrage
the
religious
notion
of
the
people
is
old
the
ark
lands
according
to
q
on
mount
ararat
in
je
as
we
have
it
no
is
named
but
this
is
not
original
as
mythic
geography
belongs
to
the
jehovist
in
all
other
passages
where
it
occurs
in
q
the
primitive
history
is
never
localised
the
whole
earth
is
given
to
man
for
a
dwelling
from
the
first
in
je
on
the
contrary
they
live
first
in
the
land
of
eden
far
to
the
east
and
presumably
high
up
in
the
north
expelled
from
eden
they
come
to
the
land
of
nod
where
cain
builds
the
town
of
enoch
and
departing
from
this
district
which
is
still
far
to
the
east
they
settle
in
the
land
of
shinar
at
the
mouths
of
the
euphrates
and
tigris
where
they
build
the
town
of
babel
shinar
is
the
point
of
departure
of
that
history
of
the
world
which
is
no
longer
merely
mythical
it
is
the
home
of
the
present
human
race
in
this
point
the
contrast
is
very
noticeable
between
the
local
definiteness
of
the
jehovist
legend
which
lends
it
the
character
of
the
idyllic
and
the
vague
generalness
of
the
other
in
shinar
according
to
je
genesis
xi
men
are
still
all
together
and
they
desire
to
remain
together
there
not
to
be
scattered
they
build
a
great
city
which
is
to
hold
them
all
and
to
make
themselves
a
name
they
add
to
it
a
high
tower
which
is
to
reach
heaven
jehovah
perceiving
in
these
attempts
the
danger
of
further
progress
in
the
same
direction
comes
down
to
confound
their
language
and
by
such
violent
means
brings
about
the
dispersion
of
the
human
race
by
the
unity
of
which
he
feels
himself
threatened
in
q
it
is
understood
that
men
are
scattered
over
the
whole
earth
they
are
never
represented
as
all
living
at
one
point
and
pains
are
accordingly
taken
to
describe
the
flood
as
quite
universal
the
division
of
the
people
comes
about
quite
simply
in
the
way
of
genealogy
and
the
division
of
the
languages
is
not
the
cause
but
the
result
of
it
accompanying
this
we
find
once
more
a
notable
difference
in
point
of
mental
attitude
what
je
regards
as
unnatural
and
only
to
be
understood
as
a
violent
perversion
of
the
original
order
is
in
q
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
the
period
between
the
flood
and
abraham
is
filled
up
in
q
by
another
genealogy
which
to
judge
from
the
analogy
of
genesis
had
probably
only
seven
members
in
je
it
can
not
have
been
wanting
there
and
may
have
passed
straight
from
shem
to
heber
and
left
out
the
grandfather
nahor
x
xxiv
xxix
who
is
even
less
to
be
distinguished
from
his
grandson
of
the
same
name
than
adam
from
enos
the
original
of
the
terahites
is
according
to
q
not
the
mesopotamian
haran
carrhae
as
in
je
xii
xxiv
but
ur
casdim
which
can
only
mean
ur
of
the
chaldees
from
there
terah
the
father
of
abraham
nahor
and
haran
is
said
to
have
emigrated
with
abraham
and
lot
the
son
of
haran
who
was
already
dead
if
this
was
so
nahor
must
have
stayed
at
ur
casdim
and
haran
must
have
died
there
but
neither
of
these
assumptions
is
consistent
with
the
indications
of
the
narrative
the
different
aspirates
notwithstanding
it
is
scarcely
allowable
to
separate
the
man
haran
from
the
town
haran
and
to
make
him
die
elsewhere
it
is
equally
impossible
to
regard
ur
in
chaldaea
as
the
residence
of
nahor
whether
the
grandfather
or
the
grandson
of
the
same
name
matters
nothing
for
it
is
obviously
not
without
relation
to
real
facts
that
the
place
which
in
any
case
must
be
in
syria
where
the
nahorides
laban
and
rebecca
dwell
is
called
in
j
the
town
of
nahor
and
in
e
haran
even
in
q
though
nahor
stays
in
ur
laban
and
rebecca
do
not
live
in
chaldaea
but
in
padan
aram
in
mesopotamian
syria
what
helps
to
show
that
ur
casdim
does
not
belong
to
the
original
form
of
the
tradition
is
that
even
in
serug
the
father
of
nahor
we
are
far
away
from
babylon
towards
the
west
serug
is
the
name
of
a
district
which
borders
haran
on
the
north
how
can
the
son
of
serug
all
at
once
leap
back
to
ur
casdim
what
the
reasons
were
for
making
babylon
abraham
point
of
departure
we
need
not
now
consider
but
after
having
left
ur
casdim
with
terah
it
is
curious
how
he
only
gets
as
far
as
haran
and
stays
there
till
his
father
death
in
q
also
it
is
from
haran
that
he
enters
palestine
here
if
anywhere
we
have
in
the
doubling
of
the
point
of
departure
an
attempt
to
harmonise
and
to
gain
a
connection
with
je
the
view
is
happily
gaining
ground
that
in
the
mythical
universal
history
of
mankind
in
genesis
the
jehovist
version
is
more
primitive
than
the
priestly
one
and
we
are
in
fact
compelled
to
adopt
this
view
when
we
observe
that
the
materials
of
the
narratives
in
question
have
not
an
israelite
but
a
universal
ethnic
origin
the
traces
of
this
origin
are
much
more
distinctly
preserved
in
the
jehovist
whence
it
comes
that
comparative
mythology
occupies
itself
chiefly
with
his
narratives
though
without
knowing
that
it
is
doing
so
the
primitive
legend
has
certainly
undergone
alterations
in
his
hands
too
its
mythic
character
is
much
obliterated
and
all
sorts
of
israelite
elements
have
crept
in
even
the
fratricide
of
cain
with
the
contrast
in
the
background
between
the
peaceful
life
of
the
hebrews
in
the
land
of
canaan
and
the
restless
wanderings
of
the
cainites
kenites
in
the
neighbouring
desert
quite
falls
out
of
the
universal
historical
and
geographical
framework
still
more
does
the
curse
of
canaan
do
so
here
the
trait
is
evidently
old
that
noah
was
the
first
to
make
wine
but
this
has
been
made
a
merely
subordinate
feature
of
a
pronouncedly
national
israelite
narrative
but
in
the
jehovist
the
process
of
emptying
the
primitive
legend
of
its
true
meaning
and
contents
has
not
gone
nearly
so
far
as
in
the
priestly
code
where
it
actually
creates
surprise
when
some
mythic
element
shines
through
as
in
the
cases
of
enoch
and
of
the
rainbow
the
mythic
materials
of
the
primitive
are
suffused
in
the
jehovist
with
a
peculiar
sombre
earnestness
a
kind
of
antique
philosophy
of
history
almost
bordering
on
pessimism
as
if
mankind
were
groaning
under
some
dreadful
weight
the
pressure
not
so
much
of
sin
as
of
creaturehood
vi
we
notice
a
shy
timid
spirit
which
belongs
more
to
heathenism
the
rattling
of
the
chains
at
intervals
only
aggravates
the
feeling
of
confinement
that
belongs
to
human
nature
the
gulf
of
alienation
between
man
and
god
is
not
to
be
bridged
over
jehovah
does
not
stand
high
enough
does
not
feel
himself
secure
enough
to
allow
the
to
come
very
near
him
there
is
almost
a
suggestion
of
the
notion
of
the
jealousy
of
the
gods
this
mood
though
in
many
ways
softened
is
yet
recognisable
enough
in
genesis
ii
in
vi
and
xi
in
the
priestly
code
it
has
entirely
disappeared
here
man
no
longer
feels
himself
under
a
secret
curse
but
allied
to
god
and
free
as
lord
of
nature
true
the
priestly
code
also
recognises
in
its
own
fashion
the
power
of
sin
this
we
saw
in
the
chapter
on
sacrifice
but
sin
as
the
root
of
ruin
explaining
it
and
capable
of
being
got
rid
of
is
the
very
opposite
of
blind
fate
the
slavery
of
sin
and
the
freedom
of
the
children
of
god
are
in
the
gospel
correlated
the
mythical
mode
of
view
is
destroyed
by
the
autonomy
of
morality
and
closely
connected
with
this
is
the
rational
way
of
looking
at
nature
of
which
we
find
the
beginnings
in
the
priestly
code
this
view
of
nature
presupposes
that
man
places
himself
as
a
person
over
and
outside
of
nature
which
he
regards
as
simply
a
thing
we
may
perhaps
assert
that
were
it
not
for
this
dualism
of
judaism
mechanical
natural
science
would
not
exist
the
removal
of
colour
from
the
myths
is
the
same
thing
as
the
process
of
hebraising
them
the
priestly
code
appears
to
hebraise
less
than
the
jehovist
it
refrains
on
principle
from
confounding
different
times
and
customs
but
in
fact
it
hebraises
much
more
it
cuts
and
shapes
the
whole
of
the
materials
so
that
they
may
serve
as
an
introduction
to
the
mosaic
legislation
it
is
true
that
the
jehovist
also
placed
these
ethnic
legends
at
the
entrance
to
his
sacred
legend
and
perhaps
selected
them
with
a
view
to
their
forming
an
introduction
to
it
for
they
are
all
ethical
and
historical
in
their
nature
and
bear
on
the
problems
of
the
world
of
man
and
not
the
world
of
nature
yet
it
is
possible
the
selection
presented
him
with
no
difficulty
since
cosmological
myths
were
not
popular
tales
but
priestly
speculations
with
which
he
was
quite
unacquainted
but
with
the
jehovist
justice
was
yet
done
to
some
extent
to
the
individuality
of
the
different
narratives
in
the
priestly
code
their
individuality
is
not
only
modified
to
suit
the
purpose
of
the
whole
but
completely
destroyed
the
connection
leading
up
to
the
torah
of
moses
is
everything
the
individual
pieces
have
no
significance
but
this
it
follows
of
course
from
this
mode
of
treatment
that
the
connection
itself
loses
all
living
reality
it
consists
apart
from
the
successive
covenants
in
mere
genealogy
and
chronology
de
wette
thinks
all
this
beautiful
because
it
is
symmetrical
and
intelligible
and
leads
well
up
to
a
conclusion
but
this
will
not
be
every
one
taste
there
is
such
a
thing
as
poetical
material
without
manufacture
how
loosely
the
narratives
of
the
primitive
history
are
connected
with
each
other
in
the
jehovist
we
see
very
clearly
in
the
section
dealing
with
the
flood
it
disagrees
both
with
what
goes
before
and
with
what
follows
it
the
genealogy
genesis
iv
issues
not
in
noah
but
in
lamech
instead
of
shem
ham
and
japhet
the
sons
of
noah
we
have
jabal
jubal
tubal
the
sons
of
lamech
as
the
inaugurators
of
the
second
period
we
have
also
the
characteristic
difference
that
shem
ham
and
japhet
give
us
a
division
of
mankind
according
to
nations
while
jabal
jubal
tubal
give
a
division
according
to
guilds
which
are
necessarily
those
of
the
same
people
as
no
people
consists
entirely
of
musicians
or
entirely
of
smiths
and
it
is
undoubtedly
the
aim
of
chapter
iv
seq
to
describe
the
origin
of
the
present
civilisation
not
of
that
which
is
extinct
having
been
destroyed
by
the
flood
is
the
father
of
the
smiths
of
the
present
not
of
those
before
the
flood
jubal
the
father
of
the
musicians
jabal
of
the
shepherds
of
the
narrator
own
period
hence
they
stand
at
the
end
of
the
genealogy
and
open
the
second
period
but
as
genesis
iv
does
not
look
forward
to
the
flood
so
neither
does
genesis
xi
the
building
of
the
tower
of
babel
look
back
to
it
this
piece
is
obviously
not
the
continuation
of
chapter
x
that
chapter
brought
us
to
a
point
at
which
the
earth
was
occupied
by
different
peoples
and
different
tongues
and
here
xi
we
are
suddenly
carried
back
to
a
time
when
the
whole
earth
was
of
one
language
and
one
speech
can
this
have
been
the
time
when
noah
family
made
up
the
whole
population
of
the
earth
or
in
other
words
does
xi
go
back
before
chap
and
join
on
to
manifestly
not
the
whole
earth
xi
is
not
merely
shem
and
ham
and
japhet
the
multitude
of
men
who
seek
by
artificial
means
to
concentrate
themselves
and
are
then
split
up
into
different
peoples
can
not
consist
of
only
one
family
the
point
of
view
is
quite
different
from
what
it
would
be
if
chaps
were
taken
into
account
the
narrator
knows
nothing
of
the
flood
which
left
noah
family
alone
surviving
out
of
the
whole
world
nor
would
it
avail
to
place
xi
at
a
period
so
long
subsequent
to
the
flood
that
the
family
might
have
increased
again
to
a
great
people
even
this
would
not
give
the
requisite
connection
with
the
idea
of
noah
and
his
three
sons
if
the
latter
united
themselves
afterwards
in
one
family
and
one
coherent
people
thus
grew
out
of
them
which
was
then
split
up
by
a
higher
power
into
different
languages
then
shem
ham
and
japhet
entirely
lose
their
significance
as
the
great
heads
of
the
nations
the
fact
is
simply
this
that
the
whole
section
of
the
flood
genesis
is
an
isolated
piece
without
any
connection
with
the
rest
of
the
narrative
of
the
jehovist
another
strange
erratic
boulder
is
the
intercourse
of
the
sons
of
god
with
the
daughters
of
men
genesis
vi
the
connection
between
see
note
this
piece
and
the
story
of
the
flood
which
follows
it
is
of
the
loosest
and
it
is
in
entire
disagreement
with
the
preceding
part
of
the
jehovist
narrative
as
it
tells
of
a
second
fall
of
man
with
a
point
of
view
morally
and
mentally
so
different
from
that
of
the
first
that
this
story
can
in
no
wise
be
regarded
as
supplementing
or
continuing
that
one
in
genesis
vi
morality
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
guilt
that
is
incurred
we
have
further
examples
which
illustrate
the
fragmentary
character
of
the
jehovist
primitive
history
as
we
have
it
in
the
story
of
the
fratricide
of
cain
and
the
curse
of
canaan
which
indeed
ought
not
to
be
here
at
all
but
belong
by
rights
to
the
history
of
the
patriarchs
we
may
close
this
section
by
reproducing
the
words
in
which
buttmann
i
seq
indicates
his
disagreement
with
de
wette
in
regard
to
the
treatment
of
the
early
legends
of
the
bible
they
are
well
worth
noting
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
antiquities
of
the
race
in
whose
sacred
writings
these
monuments
have
been
preserved
to
us
de
wette
recognises
and
follows
the
national
spirit
of
that
race
in
their
most
ancient
records
in
this
way
he
discovers
amidst
these
ruins
the
thread
of
an
old
connection
a
kind
of
epos
the
theme
of
which
was
the
glorification
of
the
people
of
israel
a
theme
which
finds
a
prelude
even
in
the
primitive
history
of
the
human
race
this
view
is
of
the
first
importance
for
the
object
he
has
before
him
which
is
the
true
criticism
of
these
books
and
for
the
moment
other
considerations
must
necessarily
yield
to
it
my
object
in
this
whole
investigation
is
only
to
find
the
universal
element
in
the
legends
of
different
nations
and
especially
to
discover
what
is
common
property
in
the
myths
of
the
different
branches
of
the
great
family
of
nations
to
which
the
hebrews
and
the
greeks
and
we
ourselves
alike
belong
thus
each
myth
reveals
itself
to
me
as
existing
for
itself
having
a
basis
and
completeness
of
its
own
and
even
when
i
find
it
in
other
nations
i
at
once
assert
for
it
its
character
as
already
known
to
me
thus
de
wette
and
i
come
to
differ
in
the
view
we
take
of
individual
myths
to
him
they
commonly
appear
as
spontaneous
free
inventions
of
individual
men
for
their
own
purposes
not
in
the
ignoble
sense
in
which
the
vulgar
view
speaks
of
the
religious
narratives
of
ancient
peoples
but
free
inventions
in
which
there
is
no
intention
to
deceive
i
on
the
contrary
can
allow
no
invention
in
these
oldest
portions
of
mythology
a
true
myth
is
never
invented
it
is
handed
down
it
is
not
true
but
it
is
honest
from
small
elements
which
fancy
offered
as
true
these
myths
arose
and
grew
without
any
contributor
to
their
growth
feeling
that
he
had
of
himself
added
to
them
those
only
had
any
conscious
intention
in
the
matter
who
touched
up
the
oldest
pure
myths
and
drew
them
into
the
great
circle
of
their
national
history
and
their
intention
though
conscious
was
quite
innocent
and
harmless
as
de
wette
describes
it
now
de
wette
sees
the
chief
traces
of
that
unity
or
of
that
national
epos
which
winds
its
way
through
the
mosaic
history
in
the
elohim
document
for
his
critical
purpose
therefore
this
document
is
the
most
important
and
it
he
for
the
most
part
follows
my
aim
forbids
me
to
attend
to
anything
but
the
inner
completeness
of
the
stories
taken
one
by
one
and
this
i
see
most
clearly
in
the
jehovah
fragments
whence
i
have
had
to
yield
the
preference
to
them
in
the
foregoing
discussions
should
each
of
us
attain
his
end
our
views
will
excellently
supplement
each
other
we
may
add
that
just
that
linked
unity
of
its
narrative
which
has
procured
for
the
priestly
code
the
title
of
the
mainstock
shows
that
it
presents
us
with
a
more
developed
form
of
the
myths
while
the
jehovist
just
because
of
the
defective
connection
in
form
of
his
fragments
which
long
caused
him
to
be
regarded
as
a
mere
of
the
fundamental
work
must
be
judged
to
stand
nearer
to
the
fountain
in
the
history
of
the
patriarchs
also
the
outlines
of
the
narrative
are
the
same
in
q
and
in
je
we
find
in
both
immigration
into
canaan
with
sarah
and
lot
his
separation
from
lot
the
birth
of
ishmael
by
hagar
the
appearance
of
god
for
the
promise
of

the
materials
here
are
not
mythical
but
national
and
therefore
more
transparent
and
in
a
certain
sense
more
historical
it
is
true
we
attain
to
no
historical
knowledge
of
the
patriarchs
but
only
of
the
time
when
the
stories
about
them
arose
in
the
israelite
people
this
later
age
is
here
unconsciously
projected
in
its
inner
and
its
outward
features
into
hoar
antiquity
and
is
reflected
there
like
a
glorified
mirage
the
skeleton
of
the
patriarchal
history
consists
it
is
well
known
of
ethnographic
genealogy
the
are
connected
with
the
under
the
common
father
then
entire
israel
is
connected
with
the
people
of
edom
under
the
old
name
of
isaac
amos
vii
isaac
again
is
connected
under
abraham
with
lot
the
father
of
moab
and
ammon
all
these
nearly
related
and
once
closely
allied
hebrew
tribes
are
shown
to
be
intimately
connected
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
mesopotamian
desert
and
sharply
marked
off
from
the
canaanites
in
whose
land
they
dwelt
the
narrative
speaks
of
its
characters
as
succeeding
each
other
in
time
or
contemporary
in
this
form
it
indicates
logical
or
statistical
subordination
and
as
a
fact
the
elements
are
generally
older
than
the
groups
and
the
smaller
groups
than
the
greater
the
migrations
which
are
mentioned
of
peoples
and
tribes
are
necessary
consequences
of
the
assumed
relationship
it
would
be
quite
possible
to
present
the
composition
and
relative
position
of
any
given
people
at
a
given
time
in
a
similar
way
in
the
form
of
a
genealogical
early
history
true
genealogy
can
scarcely
represent
precisely
the
existing
relations
it
can
not
always
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
fact
whether
a
tribe
is
the
cousin
or
the
brother
or
the
of
another
tribe
or
whether
there
is
any
affinity
at
all
between
the
two
the
affinity
can
be
understood
and
interpreted
in
different
ways
the
grouping
always
depends
to
some
extent
on
the
point
of
view
of
the
genealogist
or
even
on
his
likings
and
antipathies
the
reason
why
the
arameans
are
made
so
nearly
related
to
the
israelites
is
probably
that
the
patriarchal
legend
arose
in
middle
and
north
israel
as
indeed
the
pronounced
preference
shown
for
rachel
and
joseph
clearly
proves
to
have
been
the
case
did
the
legend
belong
originally
to
judah
it
is
likely
that
more
prominence
would
be
given
to
the
cainite
kenite
tribes
of
the
peninsula
of
sinai
which
as
it
is
are
too
much
thrust
into
the
background
for
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
in
the
earliest
history
of
israel
these
tribes
were
of
no
small
importance
nor
are
apparent
contradictions
wanting
in
the
ethnographic
genealogy
ishmael
edom
and
the
cainite
tribes
first
mentioned
come
into
mutual
contact
in
different
ways
which
may
be
quite
naturally
explained
from
different
views
and
arrangements
of
their
mutual
relationships
and
lastly
we
may
add
that
the
genealogical
form
lends
itself
to
the
reception
of
every
sort
of
materials
in
the
patriarchal
legend
however
the
ethnographic
element
is
always
predominant
abraham
alone
is
certainly
not
the
name
of
a
people
like
isaac
and
lot
he
is
somewhat
difficult
to
interpret
that
is
not
to
say
that
in
such
a
connection
as
this
we
may
regard
him
as
a
historical
person
he
might
with
more
likelihood
be
regarded
as
a
free
creation
of
unconscious
art
he
is
perhaps
the
youngest
figure
in
the
company
and
it
was
probably
at
a
comparatively
late
period
that
he
was
put
before
his
son
isaac
the
stories
about
abraham
and
those
about
isaac
are
so
similar
that
they
can
not
possibly
be
held
to
be
independent
of
each
other
the
stories
about
isaac
however
are
more
original
as
may
be
seen
in
a
striking
way
on
comparing
genesis
xx
with
xxvi
the
short
nnd
profane
version
of
which
isaac
is
the
hero
is
more
lively
and
pointed
the
long
and
edifying
version
in
which
abraham
replaces
isaac
makes
the
danger
not
possible
but
actual
thus
necessitating
the
intervention
of
the
deity
and
so
bringing
about
a
glorification
of
the
patriarch
which
he
little
deserved
all
the
commentators
on
genesis
indeed
regard
chapter
xx
as
the
original
of
xxvi
they
do
not
base
their
judgment
however
on
a
comparison
of
the
parallel
passages
but
merely
consider
that
as
the
father
is
older
than
the
son
the
story
about
the
father
is
older
than
the
corresponding
story
about
the
son
and
they
regard
isaac
generally
as
a
mere
echo
of
abraham
the
obviousness
of
this
principle
is
too
great
and
against
it
we
have
to
consider
that
the
later
development
of
the
legend
shows
a
manifest
tendency
to
make
abraham
the
patriarch
par
excellence
and
cast
the
others
into
the
shade
in
the
earlier
literature
on
the
other
hand
isaac
is
mentioned
even
by
amos
abraham
first
appears
in
isaiah
micah
vii
belongs
to
the
exile
and
the
words
who
redeemed
abraham
in
isaiah
xxix
are
not
genuine
they
have
no
possible
position
in
the
sentence
and
the
idea
of
the
salvation
of
abraham
from
the
fire
of
the
chaldaeans
is
of
late
occurrence
i
certainly
do
not
mean
to
maintain
that
abraham
was
not
yet
known
when
amos
wrote
but
he
scarcely
stood
by
this
time
at
the
same
stage
as
isaac
and
jacob
as
a
saint
of
hebron
he
might
he
of
calibite
ordain
and
have
something
to
do
with
ram
abram
may
stand
for
abiram
as
abner
for
abiner
and
ahab
for
ahiab
the
name
abu
ruham
occurs
in
the
hadith
as
proprium
in
the
jehovist
this
skeleton
of
ethnographic
genealogy
is
found
covered
throughout
with
flesh
and
blood
the
patriarchs
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
are
not
mere
names
but
living
forms
ideal
prototypes
of
the
true
israelite
they
are
all
shepherds
inclined
to
live
quietly
beside
their
tents
anxious
to
steer
clear
of
strife
and
clamour
in
no
circumstances
prepared
to
meet
force
with
force
and
oppose
injustice
with
the
sword
brave
and
manly
they
are
not
but
they
are
good
fathers
of
families
a
little
under
the
dominion
of
their
wives
who
are
endowed
with
more
temper
they
serve
jehovah
in
essentially
the
same
way
as
their
descendants
in
historical
times
religion
with
them
does
not
consist
of
sacrifice
alone
but
also
of
an
upright
conversation
and
trustful
resignation
to
god
providence
jacob
is
sketched
with
a
more
realistic
touch
than
the
other
two
he
has
a
strong
dash
of
artifice
and
desire
of
gain
qualities
which
do
not
fail
to
secure
the
ends
he
aims
at
he
escapes
from
every
difficulty
and
danger
not
only
safely
but
with
profit
jehovah
helps
him
but
above
all
he
helps
himself
without
showing
as
we
should
judge
any
great
scruple
in
his
choice
of
means
the
stories
about
him
do
not
pretend
to
be
moral
the
feeling
they
betray
is
in
fact
that
of
undissembled
joy
in
all
the
successful
artifices
and
tricks
of
the
patriarchal
rogue
of
the
subordinate
figures
esau
is
drawn
with
some
liking
for
him
then
laban
and
the
saint
lot
ishmael
is
drawn
as
the
prototype
of
the
bedouin
as
a
wild
ass
of
a
man
whose
hand
is
against
every
man
and
every
man
hand
against
him
it
is
remarkable
that
the
heroes
of
israelite
legend
show
so
little
taste
for
war
and
in
this
point
they
seem
to
be
scarcely
a
true
reflection
of
the
character
of
the
israelites
as
known
from
their
history
yet
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
that
a
people
which
found
itself
incessantly
driven
into
war
not
only
dreamed
of
an
eternal
peace
in
the
future
but
also
embodied
the
wishes
of
its
heart
in
these
peaceful
forms
of
the
golden
age
in
the
past
we
have
also
to
consider
that
the
peaceful
shepherd
life
of
the
patriarchs
is
necessary
to
the
idyllic
form
in
which
the
early
history
of
the
people
is
cast
only
peoples
or
tribes
can
make
war
not
single
men
this
also
must
serve
to
explain
why
this
consideration
is
certainly
less
decisive
than
the
foregoing
one
jacob
is
a
peaceful
shepherd
not
only
because
of
the
idyllic
form
of
the
narrative
but
in
his
own
being
and
character
he
forms
the
strongest
contrast
to
his
brother
esau
who
in
spite
of
the
idyllic
form
is
a
man
of
war
such
exceptions
as
genesis
xiv
and
xlviii
chapter
xxxiv
only
prove
the
rule
the
historical
of
the
nation
finds
so
little
expression
in
the
personal
character
of
the
patriarchs
it
makes
vent
for
itself
only
in
the
inserted
prophecies
of
the
future
in
these
we
trace
that
national
pride
which
was
the
fruit
of
the
exploits
of
david
yet
always
in
a
glorified
form
rising
to
religious
exaltation
in
the
traits
of
personal
character
ascribed
to
the
patriarchs
they
represent
substantially
the
nature
and
the
aspirations
of
the
individual
israelite
the
relations
of
israel
are
reflected
with
more
life
in
the
relations
borne
by
the
patriarchs
to
their
brothers
cousins
and
other
relatives
the
background
is
never
long
concealed
here
the
temper
of
the
period
of
the
kings
is
everywhere
discernible
this
is
the
case
most
clearly
perhaps
in
the
story
about
jacob
and
esau
the
twins
are
at
variance
even
in
the
womb
even
in
the
matter
of
his
birth
the
younger
refuses
precedence
to
the
elder
and
tries
to
hold
him
back
by
the
heel
this
is
interpreted
to
the
anxious
mother
by
the
oracle
at
beersheba
as
follows
two
nations
are
in
thy
womb
and
two
peoples
are
separated
from
thy
bowels
and
the
one
people
shall
be
stronger
than
the
other
and
the
elder
shall
serve
the
younger
the
boys
grow
up
very
different
esau
is
a
rough
and
sunburnt
hunter
ranges
about
in
the
desert
and
lives
from
day
to
day
without
care
jacob
a
pious
smooth
man
stays
at
home
beside
the
tents
and
understands
the
value
of
things
which
his
unsophisticated
brother
disregards
the
former
is
the
favourite
of
his
father
the
autochthonous
isaac
the
latter
is
preferred
by
the
mother
the
aramaean
rebecca
the
former
stays
in
his
own
land
and
takes
his
wives
from
the
original
population
of
south
canaan
and
the
sinaitic
peninsula
the
latter
emigrates
and
brings
his
wives
from
mesopotamia
thus
the
contrast
is
distinctly
prefigured
which
at
a
later
time
appeared
between
the
rough
edom
sprung
from
the
soil
and
having
his
roots
in
it
and
smoother
more
civilised
israel
which
had
more
affinity
with
the
great
powers
of
the
world
by
means
of
deceit
and
trickery
the
younger
brother
succeeds
in
depriving
the
elder
of
the
paternal
blessing
and
of
the
right
of
the
the
elder
in
consequence
of
this
determines
to
kill
him
and
the
situation
becomes
strained
edom
was
a
people
and
a
kingdom
before
israel
but
was
then
overshadowed
by
israel
and
even
subjugated
at
last
by
david
hence
the
fierce
hatred
between
the
brother
nations
of
which
amos
speaks
the
words
of
the
blessing
of
jacob
show
this
quite
distinctly
to
be
the
historical
basis
of
the
legend
a
basis
of
which
the
jews
were
perfectly
conscious
we
hear
in
the
blessing
of
repeated
attempts
of
the
edomites
to
cast
off
the
yoke
of
israel
and
it
is
predicted
that
these
efforts
will
be
at
last
successful
thus
the
stories
about
jacob
and
esau
can
not
have
taken
form
even
in
outline
before
the
time
of
david
in
their
present
form
genesis
xxvii
their
outlook
extends
to
times
still
later
the
roots
of
the
legend
being
thus
traceable
in
later
history
a
circumstance
which
the
jehovist
does
not
attempt
to
conceal
it
is
no
more
than
an
apparent
anachronism
when
he
takes
occasion
to
give
a
complete
list
of
the
edomite
kings
down
to
david
interspersing
it
with
historical
notes
as
for
example
that
hadad
ben
bedad
possibly
a
contemporary
of
gideon
defeated
the
midianites
on
the
plains
of
moab
in
the
story
of
jacob
and
laban
again
the
contemporary
background
shines
through
the
patriarchal
history
very
distinctly
the
hebrew
on
his
from
mesopotamia
to
the
land
of
jordan
is
hotly
pursued
by
his
aramean
who
overtakes
him
at
gilead
there
they
treat
with
each
other
and
pile
up
a
heap
of
stones
which
is
to
be
the
boundary
between
them
and
which
they
mutually
pledge
themselves
not
to
overstep
with
hostile
intentions
this
answers
to
the
actual
state
of
the
facts
the
hebrew
migration
into
canaan
was
followed
by
the
aramaean
which
threatened
to
overwhelm
it
gilead
was
the
boundary
between
the
two
peoples
and
the
arena
during
a
long
period
of
fierce
conflicts
which
they
waged
with
each
other
the
blessing
of
jacob
in
the
oracle
on
joseph
also
mentions
the
syrian
wars
the
archers
who
press
joseph
hard
but
are
not
able
to
overcome
him
can
be
no
other
than
the
arameans
of
damascus
to
whose
attacks
he
was
exposed
for
a
whole
century
joseph
here
appears
always
as
the
pillar
of
the
monarchy
the
wearer
of
the
crown
among
his
brethren
a
position
for
which
he
was
marked
out
by
his
early
dreams
the
story
of
joseph
however
in
so
far
as
historical
elements
can
be
traced
in
it
at
all
and
not
merely
the
free
work
of
poetry
is
based
on
much
earlier
events
from
a
time
when
the
union
was
just
being
accomplished
of
the
two
sections
which
together
became
the
people
of
israel
the
trait
of
his
brother
jealousy
of
him
points
perhaps
to
later
events
it
deserves
to
be
considered
that
at
first
joseph
is
in
egypt
alone
and
that
his
brothers
came
after
at
his
request
when
the
notion
of
united
israel
was
transferred
to
the
distant
past
one
consequence
was
that
the
fortunes
of
the
part
could
not
be
separated
from
those
of
the
whole
in
the
same
way
rachel
being
an
aramaean
leah
must
be
one
too
perhaps
the
combination
of
rachel
and
leah
in
a
national
unity
was
only
accomplished
by
moses
moses
came
from
the
peninsula
of
sinai
leah
to
lead
the
israelites
there
from
goshen
joseph
the
designation
of
levite
he
could
not
receive
in
joseph
only
in
leah
the
historical
associations
which
form
the
groundwork
of
the
stories
of
the
other
sons
of
jacob
are
also
comparatively
old
they
afford
us
almost
the
only
information
we
possess
about
the
great
change
which
must
have
taken
place
in
the
league
of
the
tribes
soon
after
moses
this
change
principally
affected
the
group
of
the
four
old
leah
tribes
which
were
closely
connected
with
each
other
reuben
assumes
the
rights
of
his
father
prematurely
and
loses
the
leadership
simeon
and
levi
make
apart
from
the
others
a
faithless
attack
on
the
canaanites
and
collective
israel
lets
them
suffer
the
consequences
alone
so
that
they
succumb
to
the
vengeance
of
their
enemies
and
cease
to
be
tribes
hence
the
primogeniture
is
transferred
to
judah
judah
also
suffers
great
losses
no
doubt
in
the
conflict
which
accompanied
the
settlement
in
the
land
of
canaan
and
is
reduced
to
a
fraction
of
his
former
importance
but
this
breach
is
made
good
by
fresh
accessions
from
the
of
the
leah
tribes
by
the
union
of
pharez
and
zarah
of
caleb
kenaz
cain
ken
jerahmeel
with
the
remnant
of
ancient
judah
the
jehovist
narratives
about
reuben
simeon
levi
and
judah
are
undoubtedly
based
on
occurrences
connected
with
the
period
of
the
conquest
of
the
holy
land
but
this
is
not
the
place
to
trace
the
historical
interpretation
of
the
stories
further
see
israel
sec
infra
genesis
iv
is
a
similar
tribal
history
the
old
tribe
of
cain
the
name
of
which
is
indicative
of
settlement
and
culture
appears
to
have
been
broken
up
and
scattered
to
the
four
winds
in
very
early
times
judges
in
the
same
way
as
levi
with
which
it
appears
to
have
divided
the
priesthood
we
have
already
said
that
genesis
iv
can
only
have
found
its
way
into
the
primitive
legend
by
interpolation
it
may
however
be
remarked
and
it
is
important
to
do
so
that
even
where
true
historic
motives
are
indisputably
present
in
the
patriarchal
legend
it
is
not
exactly
a
reproduction
of
the
facts
as
they
occurred
in
reality
edom
always
kept
up
his
hatred
against
israel
and
suppressed
his
feeling
of
relationship
amos
i
in
genesis
he
meets
his
brother
returning
from
mesopotamia
and
trembling
with
anxiety
at
the
encounter
in
a
conciliatory
temper
which
is
quite
affecting
the
touch
is
one
to
reflect
no
small
honour
on
the
ancient
israelite
to
set
against
this
we
have
the
touch
manifestly
inspired
by
hatred
of
genesis
xix
no
one
can
fail
to
wonder
why
the
daughters
of
lot
are
nameless
but
this
shows
that
they
are
inserted
between
lot
and
his
sons
moab
and
ammon
purely
for
the
sake
of
the
incest
sympathies
and
antipathies
are
everywhere
at
work
and
the
standpoint
is
throughout
that
of
northern
israel
as
appears
most
evidently
from
the
circumstance
that
rachel
is
the
fair
and
the
beloved
wife
of
jacob
whom
alone
in
fact
he
wished
to
marry
and
leah
the
ugly
and
despised
one
who
was
imposed
on
him
by
a
trick
on
the
whole
the
rivalries
this
however
only
warrants
us
to
conclude
that
these
legends
first
arose
in
ephraim
not
that
they
were
written
down
there
in
the
form
in
which
we
have
them
which
really
existed
are
rather
softened
than
exaggerated
in
this
poetical
illustration
of
them
what
tends
to
unity
is
more
prominent
and
is
more
carefully
treated
than
what
tends
to
separation
there
is
no
trace
of
any
side
glances
at
persons
and
events
of
the
day
as
at
the
unseemly
occurrences
at
the
court
of
david
and
as
little
of
any
twisting
or
otherwise
doctoring
the
materials
to
make
them
advance
this
or
that
tendency
but
these
stories
would
be
without
point
were
it
not
for
other
elements
which
enter
into
them
and
attach
them
to
this
and
that
particular
locality
in
this
aspect
we
have
first
of
all
to
consider
that
the
patriarchs
are
regarded
as
the
founders
of
the
popular
worship
at
shechem
bethel
beersheba
and
hebron
as
we
saw
above
in
perfect
correspondence
a
whole
series
of
stories
about
them
are
in
these
they
discover
by
means
of
a
theophany
that
a
certain
spot
of
earth
is
holy
ground
there
they
erect
an
altar
and
give
it
the
name
of
the
place
they
dwell
exclusively
at
places
which
were
afterwards
regarded
as
primeval
sanctuaries
and
inaugurate
the
sacrifices
which
are
offered
there
the
significance
of
these
stories
is
entirely
bound
up
with
the
locality
they
possess
an
interest
only
for
those
who
still
sacrifice
to
jehovah
on
the
same
altar
as
abraham
once
did
under
the
same
sacred
oak
of
moreh
or
mamre
in
the
same
way
the
patriarchs
discover
or
excavate
the
caves
or
springs
or
wells
and
plant
the
trees
which
their
posterity
still
count
sacred
or
at
least
honourable
after
the
lapse
of
thousands
of
years
in
some
cases
also
striking
or
significant
formations
of
the
surface
receive
a
legendary
explanation
from
the
patriarchal
age
were
the
dead
sea
not
there
sodom
and
gomorrha
would
not
have
perished
were
there
not
a
small
flat
tongue
of
land
projecting
into
the
marsh
from
the
lot
would
have
directed
his
flight
straight
to
the
mountains
of
his
sons
moab
and
ammon
and
would
not
have
made
the
detour
by
zoar
which
only
serves
to
explain
why
this
corner
was
not
included
in
the
ruin
to
the
area
of
which
it
properly
belongs
the
pillar
of
salt
into
which
wife
was
turned
was
still
pointed
out
in
the
days
of
josephus
perhaps
the
smoke
of
the
furnace
which
abraham
saw
from
the
jewish
shore
the
morning
after
the
catastrophe
has
some
connection
with
the
town

the

more

susceptible
of
a
clear
meaning
the
origin
of
mount
gilead
is
explained
from
its
historical
significance
it
is
an
immense
mound
which
was
once
heaped
up
by
laban
and
jacob
in
order
to
serve
as
a
boundary
between
aram
and
israel
in
many
instances
the
names
of
places
gave
rise
to
a
legend
which
does
not
always
hit
upon
the
true
reason
of
the
name
the
spring
of
lahai
roi
for
example
is
an
instance
of
this
the
discovery
of
this
spring
saved
hagar
and
ishmael

of

hagar
called
the
name
of
jehovah

spoke

however
as
we
have
now
indicated
it
appears
in
the
jehovist
always
and
everywhere
covered
over
with
the
robe
of
fancy
the
longer

was
spread
by

among

people
the
more
was
its
root
concealed
by
the
shoots
springing
from
it
for
example
we
may
assume
with
regard
to
the
story
of
joseph
that
just
because
it
has
almost
grown
into
a
romance
its
origin
stretches
back
to
a
remote
antiquity
the
popular
fancy
plays
as
it
will
yet
it
does
not
make
such
leaps
as
to
make
it
impossible
to
trace
its
course
miracles
angels

dreams
are
never
absent
from
the
palette
when
rachel
eats
the
mandrakes
which
reuben
had
found
and
which
leah
had
given
up
to
her
and
they
remove
her
barrenness
so
that
she
becomes
the
mother
of
joseph
we
have
a
story
based
on
a
vulgar
superstition
purely
mythical
elements
are
found
isolated
in
the
story
of
wrestling
with
the
deity
at
the
ford
of
the
jabbok
etymology
and
proverbs
are
a
favourite
motive
and
often
give
rise
to
lively
and
diversified
tales
even
in
pieces
which
we
should
be
inclined
to
attribute
to
the
art
of
individuals
old
and
characteristic
themes
may
be
involved
the
story
of
jacob
and
laban
for
example
is
entirely
composed
of
such
materials
the
courtship
at
the
well
is
twice
repeated
with
no
great
variation
the
trait
of
the
wish
to
get
his
oldest
daughter
first
off
his
hands
and
craftily
bringing
her
to
the
after
the
is
scarcely
due
to
the
invention
of
an
individual
the
shepherd
tricks
by
which
jacob
colours
the
sheep
as
he
likes
have
quite
the
flavour
of
a
popular
jest
the
observance
of
hospitality
or
transgressions
against
it
occupy
a
prominent
place
in
the
genesis
of
the
jehovist
lot
entertainment
and
the
sodomites
insulting
maltreatment
of
the
deity
who
comes
among
them
in
disguise
is
an
incident
that
appears
in
the
legends
of
many
races
there
is
little
psychological
embellishment
little
actual
for
the
most
part
we
have
the
product
of
a
countless
number
of
narrators
unconsciously
modifying
each
other
work
how
plastic
and
living
the
materials
must
have
been
even
in
the
ninth
and
eighth
century
we
see
from
the
manifold
variants
and
repetitions
of
the
same
stories
which
however
scarcely
change
the
essential
character
of
the
themes
one
more
trait
must
be
added
to
the
character
of
the
jehovist
each
of
his
narratives
may
be
understood
by
itself
apart
from
the
rest
the
genealogy
serves
merely
to
string
them
together
their
interest
and
significance
is
not
derived
from
the
connection
in
which
they
stand
many
of
them
have
a
local
colour
which
bespeaks
a
local
origin
and
how
many
of
them
are
in
substance
inconsistent
with
each
other
and
stand
side
by
side
only
by
compulsion
the
whole
literary
character
and
loose
connection
of
the
jehovist
story
of
the
patriarchs
reveals
how
gradually
its
different
elements
were
brought
together
and
how
little
they
have
coalesced
to
a
unity
in
this
point
the
patriarchal
history
of
the
jehovist
stands
quite
on
the
same
footing
with
his
legend
of
the
origins
of
the
human
race
the
nature
of
which
we
have
already
demonstrated
it
is
from
the
jehovistic
form
of
the
legends
that
we
derive
our
picture
of
the
patriarchs
that
picture
which
children
learn
at
school
and
which
they
find
it
easy
to
retain
to
compare
the
parallel
of
the
priestly
code
it
is
necessary
to
restore
it
as
a
whole
for
few
are
aware
of
the
impression
it
produces
and
abram
was
years
old
when
he
departed
out
of
haran
and
abram
took
sarai
his
wife
and
lot
his
brother
son
and
all
their
substance
that
they
had
gathered
and
the
souls
that
they
had
gotten
in
haran
and
they
went
forth
to
go
into
the
land
of
canaan
and
into
the
land
of
canaan
they
came
xii
and
the
land
was
not
able
to
bear
them
that
they
might
dwell
together
for
their
substance
was
great
so
that
they
could
not
dwell
together
and
they
separated
themselves
the
one
from
the
other
abram
dwelled
in
the
land
of
canaan
and
lot
dwelled
in
the
cities
of
the
kikkar
where
the
dead
sea
was
afterwards
and
it
came
to
pass
when
god
destroyed
the
cities
of
the
kikkar
that
god
remembered
abram
and
sent
lot
out
of
the
midst
of
the
when
he
overthrew
the
cities
in
which
lot
dwelt
xiii
xix
and
sarai
was
barren
she
had
no
child
and
sarai
abram
wife
took
hagar
the
egyptian
her
maid
after
abram
had
dwelt
ten
years
in
the
land
of
canaan
and
gave
her
to
her
husband
abram
to
be
his
wife
and
hagar
bare
abram
a
son
and
abram
called
his
son
name
which
hagar
bare
ishmael
and
abram
was
years
old
when
hagar
bare
ishmael
to
abram
xi
xvi
then
follows
the
covenant
of
god
with
abram
whose
name
he
now
changes
to
abraham
and
the
institution
of
circumcision
as
the
mark
of
those
who
belong
to
the
covenant
then
the
announcement
of
the
birth
of
isaac
by
sarai
now
ninety
years
old
who
is
henceforth
to
be
called
sarah
and
isaac
nomination
as
heir
of
the
covenant
in
place
of
ishmael
chapter
and
sarah
bore
abraham
a
son
at
the
set
time
of
which
god
had
spoken
to
him
and
abraham
called
the
name
of
his
son
that
was
born
unto
him
whom
sarah
bare
to
him
isaac
and
abraham
circumcised
his
son
isaac
after
eight
days
as
god
had
commanded
him
and
abraham
was
an
hundred
years
old
when
isaac
his
son
was
born
unto
him
xxi
and
the
life
of
sarah
was
an
hundred
and
twenty
seven
years
these
were
the
years
of
the
life
of
sarah
and
sarah
died
in
the
same
is
hebron
in
the
land
of
canaan
xxiii
then
comes
the
treaty
of
abraham
reported
with
all
due
legal
accuracy
with
ephron
the
hittite
from
whom
he
purchases
the
cave
of
machpelah
which
is
over
against
mamre
for
a
family
and
these
are
the
days
of
the
years
of
abraham
life
which
he
lived
a
hundred
and
seventy
five
years
and
abraham
gave
up
the
ghost
and
died
in
a
good
old
age
an
old
man
and
full
of
years
and
was
gathered
to
his
fellow
tribesmen
and
his
sons
isaac
and
ishmael
buried
him
in
the
cave
of
machpelah
in
the
field
of
ephron
ben
zohar
the

which
is

the
field
which
abraham
purchased
of
the
sons
of

there
was
abraham
buried
and
sarah
his
wife
and
after
abraham
was
dead
god
blessed
his
son
isaac
xxv
next
come
the
toledoth
generations
of

according
to
the

these
are
the
toledoth

the

bashemath
the
daughter

elon
the
hittite
and
they
were
a
grief
of
mind
unto
isaac
and
to
rebekah
and
rebekah
said
to
isaac
i
am
weary
of
my
life
because
of
the
daughters
of
heth
if
jacob

such
wives
of
the
daughters
of
heth
of
the
daughters
of
the
land
what
good
shall
my
life
do
to
me
then
isaac
called

thee
that
thou
mayest
inherit
the

wherein
thou
art

esau
saw

sent

that
as
he
blessed
him
he
gave
him
a
charge
saying
thou
shalt
not
take
a

of
the
daughters
of
canaan
now
jacob
hearkened
to
his
father
and
went
to
but
esau
saw
that
the
daughters
of
canaan
pleased
not
isaac
his

then
went
esau
unto

which
he
had
gotten
in
to
go
home
to

and
god
appeared
unto

said
unto

thy

then
follow
the
generations
of
esau
in
chapter
xxxvi
only
part
of
this
chapter
however
belongs
to
the
priestly
code
and
esau
took
his

and
all
the

and
his
cattle
and
all
his

he
had
got
in
the
land
of
canaan
and
went
into
the
land
of
seir
from
the
face
of
his
brother
jacob
for
their
riches
were
more
than
that
they
might
dwell
together
and
the
land
of
their
sojourn
could
not
bear
them
because
of
their
cattle
and
esau
dwelt
in
mount
seir
esau

edom
and
jacob
dwelt
in
the

of
the
sojourn
of
his
father
in

these
are
the
toledoth

they
took
their

jacob

his

all
his

brought
he
with

xlvi
then
follows
the
enumeration
of
the
seventy
souls
of
which
his
seed
was
then
composed
and
jacob
and
his
sons
came
to
egypt
to
joseph
and
pharaoh
the
king
of
egypt
heard
it
and
pharaoh
said
to
jacob
how
many
are
the
days
of
the
years
of
thy
life
and
jacob
said
to

the
days
of

years
of
my
sojourning
are
a
hundred

thirty
years
few
and
evil
have
the
days
of

been

have
not
attained
unto
the
days
of
the
years
of
the
life
of
my
fathers
in
the
days
of
their
sojourning
and
joseph
placed
his
father
and
his
brethren
and
gave
them
a
possession
in
the
land
of
egypt
in
the
best
part
of
the
land
in
the
land
of
rameses
as

had
commanded

settled
there
and
grew

said
unto
me
behold
i
will
make
thee
fruitful
and
multiply
thee
and
i
will
make
of
thee
a
multitude
of
peoples
and
will
give
this
land
to
thy
seed
after
thee
for
an
everlasting
possession
and
now
thy
two
sons
which
were
born
unto
thee
in
egypt
before
i
came
unto
thee
in
egypt
are
mine
ephraim
and
manasseh
shall
be
mine
as
reuben
and
simeon
and
the
issue
which
thou
begettest
after
them
shall
be
thine
and
shall
be
called
after
the
name
of
their
brethren
in
their
inheritance
and
when
i
came
from
padan
rachel
died
to
me
in
the
land
of
canaan
in
the
way
when
there
was
but
a
little
way
to
come
into
ephrath
and
i
buried
her
there
in
the
way
to
ephrath
the
same
is
bethlehem
xlviii
and
cf
xlix
and
his
other
sons
also
he
blessed
and
he
charged
them
and
said
unto
them
i
am
to
be
gathered
unto
my
people
bury
me
with
my
fathers
in
the
cave
of
the
field
of
machpelah
which
is
before
mamre
in
the
land
of
canaan
which
field
abraham
bought
from
ephron
the
hittite
for
a
hereditary
they
buried
abraham
and
sarah
his
wife
there
they
buried
isaac
and
rebekah
his
wife
and
there
i
buried
leah
the
possession
of
the
field
and
of
the
cave
that
is
therein
from
the
children
of
heth
and
jacob
made
an
end
of
commanding
his
sons
and
he
gathered
up
his
feet
into
the
bed
and
yielded
up
the
ghost
and
was
gathered
unto
his
xlix
and
his
sons
carried
him
into
the
land
of
canaan
and
buried
him
in
the
cave
of
the
field
of
machpelah
which
abraham
had
bought
for
a
hereditary
from
ephron
the
hittite
over
against
mamre
and
these
are
the
names
of
the
children
of
israel
which
came
into
egypt
with
jacob
they
came
every
one
with
his
house
reuben
simeon
levi
judah
issachar
zebulon
benjamin
dan
naphtali
gad
asher
and
all
the
souls
that
came
out
of
jacob
loins
were
seventy
souls
and
joseph
was
in
egypt
and
the
children
of
israel
were
fruitful
and
increased
abundantly
and
the
land
was
filled
with
them
and
the
egyptians
made
the
children
of
israel
their
servants
with
rigour
in
all
their
work
which
they
wrought
by
them
with
rigour
and
they
made
their
lives
bitter
with
hard
bondage
exodus
i
and
the
children
of
israel
sighed
by
reason
of
the
bondage
and
they
cried
and
their
cry
because
of
the
bondage
came
up
unto
god
and
god
heard
their
groaning
and
god
remembered
his
covenant
with
abraham
with
isaac
and
with
jacob
and
god
took
notice
ii
and
god
spake
unto
moses
and
said
unto
him
i
am
jehovah
i
appeared
unto
abraham
unto
isaac
and
unto
jacob
by
the
name
of
el
shaddai
but
by
my
name
jehovah
was
i
not
known
unto
them
and
i
made
a
covenant
with
them
to
give
them
the
land
of
canaan
the
land
of
their
pilgrimage
wherein
they
were
strangers
and
i
have
heard
the
groaning
of
the
children
of
israel
that
the
egyptians
keep
them
in
bondage
and
i
have
remembered
my
covenant
vi
that
is
the
whole
of
it
as
a
rule
nothing
more
is
aimed
at
than
to
give
the
mere
links
and
articulations
of
the
narrative
it
is
as
if
q
were
the
scarlet
thread
on
which
the
pearls
of
je
are
hung
in
place
of
the
somewhat
loose
connections
of
the
jehovist
the
narrative
of
the
priestly
code
shows
a
firmly
jointed
literary
form
one
remarkable
feature
of
which
is
to
be
seen
in
the
regular
titles
which
stand
at
the
head
of
the
various
sections
each
section
begins
with
the
words
lh
twldwt
sunt
from
which
genesis
derives
its
name
auth
h
biblos
genesews
ii
lxx
hence
ewald
name
for
the
priestly
code
which
is
very
appropriate
for
genesis
or
perhaps
generally
for
the
book
of
the
four
covenants
the
book
of
origins
in
the
rest
of
the
historical
literature
of
the
old
testament
nothing
like
this
as
yet
appears
it
is
also
characteristic
that
whenever
the
title
occurs
introducing
a
new
section
the
contents
of
the
preceding
section
are
first
of
all
briefly
recapitulated
so
as
to
show
the
place
of
the
link
upon
the
chain
the
priestly
code
enters
as
little
as
possible
on
the
contents
of
the
various
narratives
the
predicates
are
stripped
off
so
far
as
they
admit
of
such
treatment
and
the
subjects
duly
entered
in
a
catalogue
with
connecting
text
in
this
way
the
history
almost
shrinks
to
the
compass
of
a
genealogy
with
explanations
the
genealogy
at
least
forms
the
principal
contents
of
the
history
and
here
appears
in
such
proportions
and
such
systematic
fashion
as
nowhere
else
this
has
been
regarded
as
a
proof
that
q
belongs
to
an
older
stage
of
development
of
hebrew
historiography
than
je
there
can
be
no
doubt
it
is
said
that
the
oldest
hebrew
i
riehm
die
grundschrift
des
pentateuchs
in
studien
und
kritiken
or
indeed
oriental
history
began
with
the
historical
notices
and
traditions
inserted
in
the
tribal
or
family
catalogues
yet
we
know
positively
that
in
the
books
of
judges
samuel
and
kings
there
are
no
genealogical
statistics
at
all
while
chronicles
and
what
belongs
to
chronicles
is
full
of
them
we
know
also
that
songs
such
as
those
in
josh
x
jud
i
iii
seq
are
the
oldest
historical
monuments
and
that
a
number
of
them
are
found
in
je
and
not
a
single
one
in
herder
theory
of
the
development
of
history
out
of
genealogy
will
not
apply
here
but
indeed
what
we
have
nor
in
the
case
of
the
arabs
as
has
been
well
shown
by
sprenger
against
caussin

essai
preface
p
to
do
with
here
is
not
history
proper
at
all
but
folklore
it
is
true
that
with
the
jehovist
also
the
genealogy
underlies
the
narrative
as
its
skeleton
it
is
the
natural
chain
to
link
the
different
stories
together
and
even
at
a
time
when
the
latter
were
still
separate
and
only
circulated
orally
the
genealogy
was
not
unknown
to
the
people
when
stories
were
told
of
isaac
and
ishmael
and
lot
and
esau
every
one
knew
at
once
who
these
personages
were
and
how
they
were
related
to
israel
and
to
one
another
but
this
was
merely
the
presupposition
of
the
narratives
known
as
a
matter
of
course
to
the
hearers
the
interesting
element
in
them
consisted
in
those
traits
which
the
priestly
code
omits
stories
of
this
kind
compel
attention
because
they
set
forth
the
peculiarities
of
different
peoples
as
historically
and
really
related
to
each
other
not
according
to
an
empty
embryological
relation
it
is
the
temper
displayed
by
different
races
not
the
stem
of
their
relationship
that
makes
the
point
of
the
stories
their
charm
and
their
very
life
depend
on
their
being
transparent
and
reflecting
the
historic
attitude
of
the
time
which
gave
them
birth
the
clearer
the
traces
they
display
of
love
and
hatred
jealousy
of
rivals
and
joy
in
their
fall
the
nearer
are
we
to
the
forces
which
originated
the
tradition
about
early
times
in
the
priestly
code
all
those
stories
are
absent
in
which
there
is
anything
morally
objectionable
those
for
example
in
which
the
cowardice
of
the
patriarchs
endangers
the
honour
of
their
wives
those
of
sarah
cruel
jealousy
of
hagar
and
of
the
unlovely
contention
of
leah
and
rachel
for
husband
and
children
of
the
incest
of
daughters
of
the
violation
of

all
hatred
and
strife
and
deceit
in
the
patriarchal
family
disappear
lot
and
abraham
isaac
and
ishmael
jacob
and
esau
agree
to
separate
of
the
tricks
of
laban
and
jacob
to
each
other
of
the
treachery
of
simeon
and
levi
to
shechem
of
the
enmity
joseph
brethren
bore
to
him
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
priestly
code
it
is
not
merely
that
psychological
decorations
as
they
have
been
called
are
left
out
the
very
heart
of
the
business
has
been
cut
out
that
moab
and
ammon
ishmael
and
edom
were
hebrew
peoples
all
more
nearly
or
more
distantly
related
to
the
israelites
that
the
aramaeans
too
were
closely
connected
with
the
hebrews
by
blood
and
by
marriage
that
this
tribe
lives
in
one
district
contiguous
to
palestine
that
in
another
this
is
what
the
priestly
code
has
to
tell
dry
ethnographical
and
geographical
facts
like
these
are
presented
in
a
genealogical
form
all
we
learn
of
the
patriarchs
is
their
marriages
and
births
and
how
they
separated
to
the
various
of
their
descendants
and
folklore
could
not
possibly
be
directed
to
such
facts
as
these
at
a
period
when
these
relations
were
all
matters
of
fact
and
familiar
to
every
child
the
priestly
code
moreover
strips
the
legends
of
the
patriarchs
of
their
local
as
well
as
their
historical
colour
they
are
kept
at
a
distance
from
all
the
places
of
the
sacredness
of
which
the
jehovist
makes
them
the
founders
hupteld
gives
a
curious
turn
to
this
saying
that
in
the
priestly
code
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
have
much
more
permanent
settlements
but
it
is
this
work
that
insists
so
often
on
the
fact
that
the
patriarchs
were
pilgrims
and
had
nowhere
a
fixed
residence
it
only
says
that
abraham
dwelt
in
the
land
of
canaan
and
names
no
particular
place
even
as
the
scene
of
the
theophany
in
chapter
xvii
it
is
only
when
the
question
of
burying
sarah
and
abraham
arises
that
there
is
a
change
something
must
be
done
and
the
field
of
machpelah
near
hebron
is
acquired
no
doubt
je
reported
this
but
the
account
of
it
in
that
source
is
lost
as
a
possession
of
the
patriarchal
family
where
it
now
settles
more
permanently
that
isaac
and
jacob
continue
to
dwell
at
the
grave
of
abraham
is
a
statement
of
which
the
significance
is
negative
rather
than
positive
and
on
the
other
hand
the
patriarchal
journeys
up
and
down
in
je
are
not
designed
to
represent
them
as
wandering
nomads
but
serve
to
bring
them
in
contact
with
all
the
sacred
places
with
which
they
had
special
associations
no
historical
geography
is
needed
in
order
to
understand
the
narrative
of
the
priestly
code
in
genesis
but
that
is
only
to
say
that
it
stands
quite
away
from
the
soil
out
of
which
oral
tradition
arises
it
deals
in
no
etymology
no
proverbs
nor
songs
no
miracles
theophanies
nor
dreams
and
is
destitute
of
all
that
poetic
charm
which
adorns
the
jehovistic
narratives
but
this
proves
not
its
original
simplicity
but
its
neglect
of
the
springs
from
which
legend
arises
and
of
its
most
essential
elements
what
remains
is
anything
but
historical
objectivity
it
is
the
formula
and
nothing
more
riehm
op
cit
seq
thinks
it
is
made
out
that
the
religious
tradition
of
remote
antiquity
is
distinguished
by
its
modest
simplicity
and
by
a
style
suited
to
its
exalted
subject
only
in
the
course
of
time
was
it
adorned
with
all
sorts
of
miraculous
and
mysterious
elements
and
that
by
the
fancy
of
the
people
which
however
does
not
so
easily
gain
entrance
into
serious
literature
he
appeals
to
the
fact
that
the
conception
of
angels
though
certainly
long
developed
with
the
people
occurs
in
the
earlier
prophets
only
in
isolated
instances
and
in
the
later
prophets
as
ezekiel
zechariah
daniel
more
frequently
it
is
difficult
to
sift
out
what
is
true
and
what
is
false
in
this
confused
argument
in
the
priestly
code
there
are
it
is
true
no
angels
but
on
the
other
hand
we
have
azazel
and
seirim
xi
isaiah
xiii
xxxiv
comp
supra
for
where
the
gods
are
not
the
ghosts
have
sway
in
one
of
the
two
main
sources
of
the
jehovist
j
we
find
chiefly
the
jahve
message
of
jehovah
that
is
jehovah
himself
in
so
far
as
he
appears
and
manifests
himself
whether
in
a
natural
phenomenon
or
in
human
form
different
are
the
elohim
beings
of
divine
substance
they
perhaps
are
indicated
in
the
plural
in
the
mouth
of
jehovah
genesis
iii
xi
both
of
these
are
doubtless
very
old
in
the
other
principal
source
e
a
mixture
appears
to
have
taken
place
the
heavenly
hosts
are
not
only
the
children
and
companions
of
deity
but
also
its
messengers
conductors
of
the
communication
between
heaven
and
earth
xviii
here
we
have
the
beside
god
and
in
the
plural
this
view
also
is
not
exactly
a
late
one
as
we
see
from
the
vision
of
micaiah
t
kings
xxii
what
does
riehm
mean
by
high
antiquity
a
period
from
which
no
monuments
are
preserved
to
us
why
does
he
limit
his
attention
to
the
prophetic
literature
he
concedes
that
the
idea
of
angels
was
early
present
in
the
fancy
of
the
people
and
he
should
have
been
equal
to
the
further
concession
that
those
who
wrote
down
the
folklore
occupied
a
somewhat
different
position
to
popular
belief
from
that
of
the
prophetic
preachers
of
repentance
not
even
the
historical
books
admit
of
being
measured
by
the
same
standard
in
this
matter
as
the
tradition
and
which
is
the
more
original
that
the
angels
use
a
ladder
as
in
genesis
or
that
they
have
wings
as
in
isaiah
and
finally
as
for
the
reference
to
ezekiel
zechariah
and
daniel
the
difference
appears
to
me
to
be
tolerably
plain
between
a
systematic
angelology
which
operates
always
with
numbers
and
names
and
the
childlike
belief
in
angels
the
former
removes
god
to
a
distance
the
latter
brings
him
near
as
with
the
legend
of
the
beginnings
of
things
so
with
the
legend
of
the
patriarchs
what
is
essential
and
original
is
the
individual
element
in
the
several
stories
the
connection
is
a
secondary
matter
and
only
introduced
on
the
stories
being
collected
and
reduced
to
writing
but
in
the
priestly
code
the
individuality
of
the
several
stories
is
simply
destroyed
to
such
an
extent
is
the
connection
dwelt
on
what
meaning
is
there
in
the
statement
that
jacob
was
all
at
once
called
israel
xxxv
if
no
mention
is
made
of
his
wrestling
with
el
which
was
the
occasion
of
his
change
of
name
have
we
anything
like
the
true
history
of
joseph
in
the
priestly
code
can
we
regard
it
as
the
original
history
when
the
destruction
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
is
dismissed
in
a
subordinate
clause
as
is
done
in
xix
the
remarkable
admission
has
been
made
that
it
is
plain
from
the
summary
riehm
cit
manner
of
reporting
of
the
priestly
code
that
the
author
could
have
told
his
story
at
much
greater
length
had
it
been
consistent
with
the
plan
of
his
work
to
do
so
and
that
this
certainly
points
to
sources
where
greater
detail
was
used
the
more
detailed
source
however
which
is
thus
taken
for
granted
need
by
no
means
it
is
said
have
been
a
written
one
and
least
of
all
the
jehovistic
narrative
before
us
on
the
contrary
we
are
told
the
state
of
the
case
is
best
satisfied
by
the
assumption
that
the
author
held
a
more
detailed
narrative
to
be
unnecessary
because
the
oral
tradition
living
in
the
mouth
of
the
people
was
quite
able
to
fill
in
the
colours
in
his
outlines
and
to
convert
his
chronistic
notices
into
living
pictures
but
this
is
merely
an
attempt
to
elude
the
necessity
for
exactly
comparing
the
priestly
code
and
the
jehovist
the
question
is
which
of
the
two
writings
stands
nearest
to
the
is
it
the
one
which
attaches
most
importance
to
elements
which
are
foreign
to
the
nature
of
oral
tradition
altogether
and
only
added
in
literary
composition
it
would
be
a
curious
thing
if
the
writing
down
of
the
tradition
began
with
writing
down
what
the
legend
did
not
contain
what
is
set
before
us
in
the
priestly
code
is
the
quintessence
not
of
the
oral
tradition
but
of
the
tradition
when
already
written
down
and
the
written
account
of
the
primitive
history
which
it
employs
is
the
jehovistic
narrative
the
order
in
which
the
popular
legends
are
there
placed
here
becomes
the
very
kernel
of
the
narrative
there
the
plan
was
hidden
behind
the
execution
but
here
it
comes
forward
not
indeed
essentially
changed
but
sharp
and
accentuated
as
the
principal
feature
of
the
whole
the
jehovist
still
lives
in
the
spirit
of
the
legend
but
the
priestly
code
is
strange
to
that
spirit
and
does
violence
to
the
legend
by
treating
it
from
its
own
point
of
view
which
is
quite
different
from
the
old
one
moral
and
religious
culture
is
further
advanced
and
hence
the
removal
of
real
or
apparent
offences
against
morality
and
of
notions
which
are
too
childish
or
superstitious
or
even
mythical
if
the
godhead
appears
it
must
not
be
patent
to
the
senses
at
least
it
must
not
be
seen
in
visible
form
jehovah
speaks
with
jacob
but
not
in
a
dream
from
the
heavenly
ladder
he
reveals
himself
to
moses
but
not
in
the
burning
bush
the
notion
of
revelation
is
retained
but
the
subsidiary
incidents
which
must
be
added
to
make
a
concrete
of
the
abstract
are
stripped
off
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
under
what
forms
or
through
what
media
a
man
receives
revelation
if
only
the
fact
stands
sure
in
other
words
revelation
is
no
longer
a
living
reality
of
the
present
but
a
dead
dogma
for
the
past
the
progress
of
culture
in
the
priestly
code
is
most
of
all
evident
in
the
learned
historical
treatment
with
which
the
legend
is
overlaid
first
of
all
there
is
the
chronology
which
we
encountered
even
in
the
legend
of
the
origins
of
mankind
and
which
is
naturally
continued
in
the
patriarchal
legend
here
indeed
we
see
with
special
plainness
how
foreign
learned
calculation
is
to
the
poetical
materials
in
some
instances
the
facts
lead
to
quite
a
different
view
from
that
of
the
numbers
following
the
numbers
of
the
priestly
code
we
may
with
the
rabbis
regard
shem
and
eber
as
the
venerable
heads
of
the
jewish
school
in
which
the
child
jacob
learned
his
letters
and
the
torah
then
jacob
sojourn
in
mesopotamia
lasts
about
eighty
years
and
all
this
time
isaac
is
iying
on
his
after
being
long
dead
for
us
he
suddenly
appears
again
but
only
to
die
and
hand
in
hand
with
the
chronology
there
goes
the
general
predilection
of
the
priestly
code
for
numbers
and
names
which
displays
itself
even
in
genesis
though
not
nearly
so
marked
there
as
in
the
later
books
of
the
pentateuch
oral
folklore
can
very
well
contain
round
numbers
such
as
the
twelve
sons
and
the
seventy
souls
of
the
family
of
jacob
the
twelve
wells
and
the
seventy
palm
trees
at
elim
the
seventy
elders
and
the
twelve
spies
but
a
chronological
system
whole
lists
of
exact
and
considerable
numbers
bare
catalogues
of
personal
names
none
of
them
having
any
significance
dates
and
measurements
such
as
those
in
the
account
of
the
flood
in
the
priestly
code
require
writing
even
to
originate
not
to
speak
of
transmitting
them
these
of
pedantry
toke
the
place
of
the
living
poetic
detail
of
the
jehovist
narrative
the
element
of
episode
has
to
give
way
to
the
seriousness
of
dry
history
it
is
also
a
mark
of
historical
pedantry
that
the
mixing
up
of
the
period
of
the
patriarchs
with
a
later
period
is
avoided
as
anachronistic
in
the
jehovist
the
present
everywhere
shines
through
he
in
no
way
conceals
his
own
age
we
are
told
that
babylon
is
the
great
that
the
assyrian
empire
is
in
existence
with
the
cities
of
niniveh
and
calah
and
resen
that
the
canaanites
had
once
dwelt
in
palestine
but
had
long
been
absorbed
in
the
israelites
the
writer
of
the
priestly
code
is
very
careful
not
to
do
anything
like
this
he
brushes
up
the
hence
also
archaisms
such
as
luz
ephrath
compare
the
antiquarian
lore
in
deuteronomy
and
in
genesis
xiv
legend
and
makes
history
of
it
according
to
the
rules
of
art
he
kills
it
as
legend
and
deprives
it
of
all
real
value
such
as
it
possesses
not
indeed
for
the
history
of
primitive
times
but
for
that
of
the
age
of
the
kings
the
history
of
the
first
men
and
of
the
patriarchs
is
divided
by
the
priestly
code
into
three
periods
each
of
them
opened
by
a
covenant
the
covenant
with
adam
genesis
i
is
the
simplest
it
is
not
called
a
covenant
but
it
is
the
basis
of
the
second
covenant
with
noah
ix
which
modifies
it
in
important
particulars
and
brings
it
nearer
to
the
present
age
the
covenant
with
abraham
genesis
xvii
which
alone
is
ratified
with
the
succeeding
patriarchs
does
not
apply
to
the
whole
of
mankind
but
only
to
abraham
seed
and
especially
to
israel
the
first
sign
of
the
covenant
is
the
sabbath
genesis
ii
comp
exodus
xxxi
seq
ezekiel
xx
the
second
the
rainbow
genesis
ix
the
third
circumcision
xvii
the
first
parent
of
mankind
is
enjoined
to
use
a
purely
vegetable
diet
the
father
of
mankind
after
the
flood
receives
permission
to
slaughter
animals
but
he
is
expressly
ordered
not
to
eat
flesh
in
the
blood
and
besides
to
shed
the
blood
of
no
man
what
is
said
to
noah
remains
good
for
abraham
but
to
the
latter
god
promises
that
his
posterity
by
sarah
shall
possess
the
land
of
canaan
and
this
is
further
assured
by
the
purchase
of
the
cave
of
machpelah
for
a
family
the
purchase
being
executed
according
to
all
the
forms
of
law
with
prolonged
negotiations
further
god
reveals
himself
to
abraham
as
el
shaddai
and
under
this
name
he
also
manifests
himself
to
isaac
xxviii
and
jacob
xxxv
repeating
to
them
the
promise
of
the
possession
of
the
land
it
is
pointed
out
with
emphasis
that
god
was
not
known
to
the
time
under
his
israelite
name
that
he
revealed
himself
to
the
patriarchs
only
as
el
shaddai
and
as
jehovah
first
to
moses
exod
vi
with
a
similar
intention
which
is
not
far
to
seek
the
time
of
the
patriarchs
is
kept
free
of
the
other
mosaic
forms
of
worship
hence
we
have
here
no
sacrifices
nor
altars
no
distinction
of
clean
and
unclean
beasts
nor
anything
of
the
kind
now
till
within
a
short
time
ago
there
was
a
great
inclination
no
one
will
be
found
at
this
date
to
acknowledge
that
he
felt
it
to
admire
the
sobriety
and
faithfulness
of
the
priestly
code
as
shown
in
this
observance
of
the
different
religious
stages
but
in
fact
we
can
only
admire
these
advantages
in
it
if
we
believe
that
the
religion
was
at
first
naturalistic
that
then
all
at
once
it
became
a
good
deal
more
positive
and
then
quite
positive
in
the
year
how
can
we
regard
it
as
showing
historical
faithfulness
that
the
patriarchs
were
allowed
to
slaughter
but
not
to
sacrifice
and
that
first
the
sabbath
was
introduced
then
the
rainbow
then
circumcision
and
at
last
sacrifice
under
moses
it
is
natural
that
jacob
at
bethel
should
give
tithes
of
all
that
he
possesses
unnatural
that
the
eponymous
hero
should
not
in
worship
above
all
things
have
left
a
good
example
to
his
posterity
what
is
it
but
a
theory
that
the
name
jehovah
was
first
revealed
to
moses
and
through
him
to
the
israelites
and
that
it
was
quite
unknown
before
a
theory
which
certainly
can
not
be
upheld
for
moses
could
have
done
nothing
more
irrational
than
to
introduce
a
new
name
for
the
god
of
their
fathers
to
whom
he
directed
his
people
and
yet
a
theory
which
from
the
correlation
between
jehovah
the
god
of
israel
and
israel
the
people
of
jehovah
readily
suggests
itself
and
is
not
altogether
peculiar
to
the
author
of
the
priestly
code
he
had
a
pattern
which
suggested
exodus
vi
q
iii
je
the
burning
bush
shows
the
theophany
in
the
jehovist
to
be
the
earlier
in
the
priestly
code
it
almost
loses
the
character
of
a
theophany
entirely
but
this
is
also
quite
clear
on
a
comparison
of
exodus
vii
q
and
iv
je
the
phrase
vii
behold
i
make
thee
a
god
to
pharaoh
and
aaron
thy
brother
shall
be
thy
prophet
is
a
degradation
of
the
corresponding
passage
iv
aaron
shall
be
to
thee
for
a
mouth
and
thou
shalt
be
to
him
for
a
god
for
if
aaron
is
the
prophet
or
the
mouth
of
moses
then
in
the
original
and
only
appropriate
way
of
thinking
of
the
matter
moses
is
a
god
for
aaron
not
for
pharaoh
by
the
way
is
there
anything
in
the
similarity
between
sene
and
sinai
certain
lines
and
these
he
traces
strongly
and
with
a
system
and
he
even
goes
so
far
as
to
avoid
the
name
of
jehovah
even
in
his
own
narrative
of
the
period
even
when
speaking
in
his
own
person
he
says
elohim
not
jehovah
down
to
exodus
vi
the
three
periods
and
the
three
corresponding
covenants
of
the
early
age
are
preliminaries
to
the
fourth
period
and
the
fourth
covenant
the
narrator
everywhere
has
an
eye
to
the
mosaic
law
and
the
thought
of
it
determined
the
plan
which
comes
so
prominently
into
view
in
his
representation
of
the
origins
of
human
history
the
great
features
of
this
plan
are
the
great
official
transactions
of
jehovah
with
the
patriarchs
in
these
we
have
not
a
narrative
but
only
speeches
and
negotiations
the
preliminary
laws
are
given
in
them
which
as
they
advance
step
by
step
prepare
the
way
for
the
great
law
namely
the
mosaic
the
law
of
worship
has
taken
the
place
of
the
legend
of
worship
in
the
legend
the
sacred
usages
and
customs
arise
as
it
were
spontaneously
in
connection
with
any
occasion
placed
in
the
early
sacred
time
which
may
serve
to
account
for
them
jehovah
does
not
make
it
statutory
that
the
sinew
of
the
thigh
may
not
be
eaten
but
he
wrestles
with
israel
and
injures
the
sinew
of
his
thigh
during
the
wrestling
and
for
this
reason
the
children
of
israel
do
not
eat
thereof
in
the
following
story
it
is
explained
how
it
came
about
that
the
israelites
circumcise
young
boys
exodus
iv
as
moses
was
returning
from
midian
to
goshen
he
spent
a
night
on
the
road
and
jehovah
fell
upon
him
with
the
intention
of
killing
him
his
wife
zipporah
however
took
a
flint
and
cut
off
the
foreskin
of
her
son
and
touched
moses
l
raglfyw
with
it
saying
thou
art
a
to
me
then
jehovah
let
him
go
thus
zipporah
circumcises
her
son
instead
of
her
husband
makes
the
latter
symbolically
a
and
thereby
delivers
him
from
the
wrath
of
jehovah
to
which
he
is
exposed
because
he
is
not
a
because
he
has
not
submitted
to
circumcision
before
his
marriage
in
other
words
the
circumcision
of
male
infants
is
here
explained
as
a
milder
substitute
for
the
original
circumcision
of
young
men
before
marriage
compare
with
this
the
style
in
which
in
genesis
xvii
that
this
is
in
fact
the
original
custom
is
clear
from
the
word
xtn
which
signifies
both
circumcision
and
bridegroom
or
in
arabic
this
explains
the
meaning
of
xtn
dmym
in
exodus
iv
the
original
usage
is
still
in
force
with
some
arab
tribes
in
genesis
xxxiv
shechem
has
to
submit
to
circumcision
before
marriage
the
priestly
code
institutes
the
circumcision
of
male
children
on
the
eighth
day
after
birth
this
institution
completely
throws
into
the
shade
and
spoils
the
story
out
of
which
it
arose
namely
the
promise
of
the
birth
of
isaac
as
a
reward
to
abraham
of
the
hospitality
he
showed
jehovah
at
hebron
but
there
is
more
than
a
difference
in
form
there
is
a
material
contradiction
between
the
jehovistic
legend
and
the
priestly
law
the
law
purifies
the
legend
that
is
to
say
denies
all
its
main
features
and
motives
as
we
saw
in
the
first
chapter
there
is
a
conscious
polemic
at
work
in
the
representation
in
the
priestly
code
that
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
erect
no
altars
and
practice
no
religious
rites
and
that
they
have
no
connection
with
the
sacred
places
with
which
in
je
they
are
inseparably
associated
the
popular
religious
book
preserved
to
us
in
the
jehovistic
genesis
not
corrected
to
any
great
extent
though
certainly
to
some
extent
tells
how
the
ancestors
and
representatives
of
israel
founded
the
old
popular
worship
at
the
principal
sites
at
which
it
was
kept
up
the
law
of
the
legitimate
cultus
of
jerusalem
as
it
lies
before
us
in
the
priestly
code
reforms
and
destroys
the
old
popular
worship
on
the
basis
of
mosaic
prophetical
ideas
the
tabernacle
does
not
harmonize
with
the
sanctuaries
of
hebron
beersheba
shechem
kadesh
mahanaim
bethel
the
patriarchs
live
at
hebron
only
because
they
are
to
be
buried
there
not
to
entertain
the
deity
under
the
oak
of
mamre
and
to
build
an
altar
there
the
heretical
mac
c
ebas
trees
and
wells
disappear
and
with
them
the
objectionable
customs
that
god
should
have
summoned
abraham
to
offer
up
to
him
his
only
son
is
an
idea
the
priestly
code
could
not
possibly
entertain
the
whole
material
of
the
legend
is
subordinated
to
legislative
designs
the
modifying
influence
of
the
law
on
the
narrative
is
everywhere
apparent
the
attitude
of
judaism
to
the
old
legend
is
on
the
whole
negative
but
it
added
some
new
elements
while
the
patriarchs
are
not
allowed
to
sacrifice
only
to
slaughter
they
have
on
the
other
hand
the
sabbath
and
circumcision
in
this
they
are
like
i
the
sabbath
is
not
a
mosaic
institution
according
to
the
priestly
code
but
it
is
presupposed
in
exodus
and
according
to
genesis
ii
it
was
in
force
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
with
the
old
israelites
the
sabbath
was
much
less
important
in
relation
to
worship
than
the
festivals
in
judaism
the
opposite
was
the
case
the
jews
in
babylon
who
were
deprived
of
the
national
cultus
and
replaced
it
with
these
two
symbols
of
religious
membership
and
union
which
were
independent
of
the
temple
of
jerusalem
in
the
exile
after
the
cessation
of
the
service
of
the
altar
the
sabbath
and
circumcision
attained
that
significance
as
symbols
in
the
genuine
old
meaning
of
the
greek
word
as
practical
symbols
of
judaism
which
they
retain
to
the
present
day
the
emphasis
is
noteworthy
with
which
the
priestly
code
always
insists
on
the
fact
that
the
patriarchs
sojourned
in
a
strange
land
that
they
were
if
we
also
consider
that
abraham
is
said
to
have
migrated
into
palestine
from
ur
from
chaldaea
it
is
hardly
possible
to
reject
the
idea
that
the
circumstances
of
the
exile
had
some
influence
in
moulding
the
priestly
form
of
the
patriarchal
legend
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
the
historian
and
all
the
archaic
appearance
of
his
work
it
may
in
that
case
still
be
the
fact
that
the
surroundings
of
the
narrator
found
positive
expression
in
his
description
of
the
patriarchal
times
in
the
jehovistic
genesis
is
a
most
important
part
and
occupies
at
least
a
half
of
the
whole
work
in
the
priestly
code
genesis
quite
disappears
in
comparison
with
the
later
books
only
with
the
mosaic
legislation
does
this
work
arrive
at
its
own
ground
and
it
at
once
stifles
the
narrative
under
a
mass
of
legislative
matter
here
also
there
is
a
thin
historical
thread
running
parallel
to
the
jehovist
but
we
constantly
lose
sight
of
it
from
the
repeated
interruptions
made
by
extensive
ritual
laws
and
statistical
statements
these
last
four
books
of
moses
have
been
made
quite
unreadable
by
a
most
melancholy
most
incomprehensible
revision
the
course
of
the
history
is
everywhere
interrupted
by
the
insertion
of
innumerable
laws
with
regard
to
the
greater
part
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
see
any
reason
for
their
being
inserted
where
they
are
the
dislocation
of
the
narrative
by
these
monstrous
growths
of
legislative
matter
is
not
as
goethe
thinks
to
be
imputed
to
the
editor
it
is
the
work
of
the
unedited
priestly
code
itself
and
is
certainly
intolerable
nor
can
it
be
original
the
literary
form
of
the
work
at
once
shows
this
it
is
still
possible
to
trace
how
the
legal
matter
forces
its
way
into
the
narrative
and
once
there
spreads
itself
and
takes
up
more
and
more
room
in
the
jehovist
one
form
of
the
tradition
may
still
be
discerned
according
to
which
the
israelites
on
crossing
the
red
sea
at
once
proceeded
towards
kadesh
without
making
the
detour
to
sinai
we
only
get
to
sinai
in
exodus
but
in
exodus
xvii
we
are
already
at
massah
and
meribah
on
the
ground
of
kadesh
that
is
the
scene
of
the
story
of
moses
striking
water
out
of
the
rock
with
his
staff
there
the
fight
with
the
amalekites
took
place
they
lived
there
and
not
at
sinai
there
also
the
visit
of
jethro
which
requires
a
locality
at
some
distance
from
his
home
at
sinai
a
place
where
the
people
had
not
merely
a
temporary
encampment
but
their
permanent
seat
of
justice
kadesh
is
also
called
meribah
the
seat
of
justice
or
meribath
kadesh
the
seat
of
justice
at
the
holy
spring
meribah
is
in
its
meaning
the
same
as
midian
hence
the
narratives
which
are
told
before
the
arrival
at
sinai
are
repeated
after
the
departure
from
it
because
the
locality
is
the
same
before
and
after
namely
the
wilderness
of
kadesh
the
true
scene
of
the
mosaic
history
the
institution
of
judges
and
elders
concludes
the
narrative
before
the
great
sinai
section
and
begins
the
narrative
after
it
ex
numbers
xi
the
story
of
the
manna
and
the
quails
occurs
not
only
in
exodus
but
also
in
numbers
xi
and
the
rocky
spring
called
forth
by
moses
at
massah
and
meribah
is
both
in
exodus
xvii
and
numbers
xx
in
other
words
the
israelites
arrived
at
kadesh
the
original
object
of
their
wanderings
not
after
the
digression
to
sinai
but
immediately
after
the
exodus
and
they
spent
there
the
forty
years
of
their
residence
in
the
wilderness
kadesh
is
also
the
original
scene
of
the
legislation
there
he
made
them
statute
and
judgment
and
there
he
proved
them
we
read
in
a
poetical
fragment
before
the
sinai
section
exodus
xv
which
is
now
placed
in
the
narrative
of
the
healing
of
the
waters
at
marah
but
stands
there
quite
isolated
and
without
bearing
on
its
context
the
curious
conjunction
of
judgment
and
trial
points
unmistakably
to
massah
and
meribah
judgment
and
that
is
to
kadesh
as
the
place
spoken
of
but
the
legislation
at
the
seat
of
judgment
at
kadesh
is
not
represented
as
a
single
act
in
which
moses
promulgates
to
the
israelites
once
for
all
a
complete
and
comprehensive
body
of
laws
it
goes
on
for
forty
years
and
consists
in
the
dispensation
of
justice
at
the
sanctuary
which
he
begins
and
the
priests
and
judges
carry
on
after
him
according
to
the
pattern
he
set
this
is
the
idea
in
the
extremely
instructive
narrative
in
exodus
of
which
kadesh
is
the
scene
and
in
this
way
the
torah
has
its
place
in
the
historical
narrative
not
in
virtue
of
its
matter
as
the
contents
of
a
code
but
from
its
form
as
constituting
the
professional
activity
of
moses
it
is
in
the
history
not
as
a
result
as
the
sum
of
the
laws
and
usages
binding
on
israel
but
as
a
process
it
is
shown
how
it
originated
how
the
foundation
was
laid
for
the
living
institution
of
that
torah
which
still
exists
and
is
in
force
in
israel
the
true
and
original
significance
of
sinai
is
quite
independent
of
the
legislation
it
was
the
seat
of
the
deity
the
sacred
mountain
doubtless
not
only
for
the
israelites
but
generally
for
all
the
hebrew
and
cainite
kenite
tribes
of
the
surrounding
region
the
priesthood
of
moses
and
his
successors
was
derived
from
the
priesthood
there
there
jehovah
appeared
to
him
in
the
burning
bush
when
he
was
keeping
the
sheep
of
the
priest
of
midian
from
there
he
sent
him
to
egypt
there
to
the
israelites
jehovah
still
dwelt
long
after
they
had
settled
in
palestine
in
the
song
of
deborah
he
is
summoned
to
come
from
sinai
to
succour
his
oppressed
people
and
to
place
himself
at
the
head
of
his
warriors
according
to
the
view
of
the
poet
of
deuteronomy
xxxiii
the
israelites
did
not
go
to
jehovah
to
sinai
but
the
converse
he
came
to
them
from
sinai
to
kadesh
jehovah
came
from
sinai
and
shone
from
seir
unto
them
he
lightened
from
mount
paran
and
came
to
meribath
kadesh
we
do
not
know
where
sinai
was
situated
and
the
bible
is
scarcely
at
one
on
the
subject
only
dilettanti
care
much
for
controversy
on
the
matter
the
midian
of
exodus
ii
tells
us
most
it
is
probably
madian
on
the
arabic
shore
of
the
ked
sea
in
our
passage
sinai
seems
to
be
of
edom
the
way
from
sinai
to
kadesh
is
by
seir
and
paran
but
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
how
it
came
to
be
thought
more
seemly
that
the
israelites
should
undertake
the
journey
to
jehovah
this
was
at
first
put
in
the
form
that
they
appeared
there
before
the
face
of
jehovah
to
worship
him
and
offer
him
a
sacrifice
exodus
iii
and
at
their
departure
they
received
the
ark
instead
of
jehovah
himself
who
continued
to
dwell
on
sinai
exodus
xxxiii
for
the
ark
represents
jehovah
that
constitutes
its
significance
and
not
the
tables
of
the
law
which
were
not
in
it
at
first
it
was
a
further
step
to
make
sinai
the
scene
of
the
solemn
inauguration
of
the
historical
relation
between
jehovah
and
israel
this
was
done
under
the
poetic
impulse
to
represent
the
constituting
of
the
people
of
jehovah
as
a
dramatic
act
on
an
exalted
stage
what
in
the
older
tradition
was
a
process
which
went
on
quietly
and
slowly
occupied
completely
the
whole
period
of
moses
and
was
at
the
beginning
just
such
as
it
still
continued
to
be
was
now
for
the
sake
of
solemnity
and
vividness
compressed
into
a
striking
scene
of
inauguration
if
this
were
done
the
covenant
between
jehovah
and
israel
must
receive
a
positive
as
well
as
a
negative
character
that
is
to
say
jehovah
himself
must
announce
to
the
people
the
basis
and
the
conditions
of
it
thus
the
necessity
arose
to
communicate
in
this
place
the
contents
of
the
fundamental
laws
and
so
the
matter
of
the
legislation
made
its
way
into
the
historical
narrative
but
that
it
did
not
belong
originally
to
this
place
we
see
from
the
confusion
which
obtains
even
in
the
jehovistic
sinai
section
exodus
the
small
bodies
of
laws
which
are
here
communicated
may
in
themselves
be
old
enough
but
they
are
forced
into
the
narrative
it
is
only
of
what
is
relatively
the
most
recent
corpus
the
decalogue
in
e
that
this
can
not
be
asserted
as
the
jehovistic
work
was
originally
a
pure
so
deuteronomy
when
it
was
first
discovered
was
a
pure
chapters
the
two
historical
introductions
chapter
and
chapter
were
added
later
as
well
as
the
appendices
chapter
xxviii
seq
these
two
works
the
historical
and
legal
were
at
first
quite
independent
of
each
other
only
afterwards
were
they
conjoined
perhaps
that
the
new
law
might
share
in
the
popularity
of
the
old
people
book
and
at
the
same
time
infuse
into
it
its
own
spirit
it
made
it
the
easier
to
do
this
that
as
we
have
just
seen
a
piece
of
law
had
already
been
taken
up
into
the
jehovistic
to
the
decalogue
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
of
the
forty
years
was
now
added
deuteronomy
at
the
close
of
that
period
the
situation
of
which
the
law
itself
knows
nothing
is
very
well
chosen
not
only
because
moses
is
entitled
when
making
his
testament
to
anticipate
the
future
and
make
a
law
for
the
time
to
come
but
also
because
the
law
being
placed
at
the
close
of
his
life
the
thread
of
the
narrative
is
not
further
interrupted
the
law
being
simply
inserted
between
the
pentateuch
and
the
book
of
joshua
this
combination
of
deuteronomy
with
the
jehovist
was
the
beginning
of
the
combination
of
narrative
and
law
and
the
fact
that
this
precedent
was
before
the
author
of
the
priestly
code
explains
how
though
his
concern
was
with
the
torah
alone
he
yet
went
to
work
from
the
very
outset
and
comprised
in
his
work
the
history
of
the
creation
as
if
it
also
belonged
to
the
torah
this
manner
of
setting
forth
the
torah
in
the
form
of
a
history
book
is
not
in
the
least
involved
in
the
nature
of
the
case
on
the
contrary
it
introduces
the
greatest
amount
of
awkwardness
how
it
came
about
can
only
be
explained
in
the
way
above
described
an
antecedent
process
of
the
same
nature
in
literary
history
led
the
way
and
made
the
suggestion
that
the
author
of
the
priestly
code
had
before
him
the
combination
of
the
sinai
legislation
of
the
jehovist
and
deuteronomy
is
shown
further
by
the
circumstance
that
he
has
both
a
legislation
at
mount
sinai
and
a
legislation
in
the
arboth
moah
and
in
addition
to
these
one
in
the
wilderness
of
sinai
as
from
the
literary
point
of
view
so
also
from
the
historical
the
moses
of
the
jehovist
appears
more
original
than
the
moses
of
the
priestly
code
to
prove
this
is
it
is
true
the
aim
of
the
entire
present
work
yet
it
will
not
on
that
account
be
thought
out
of
place
if
we
take
advantage
of
this
convenient
opportunity
for
a
brief
sketch
and
criticism
of
the
conflicting
historical
views
of
moses
and
his
work
in
the
two
main
sources
of
the
pentateuch
according
to
the
priestly
code
moses
is
a
religious
founder
and
legislator
as
we
are
accustomed
to
think
of
him
he
receives
and
promulgates
the
torah
perhaps
not
as
a
book
though
when
we
the
law
might
accordingly
be
called
moses
as
with
the
ethiopians
the
psalter
is
called
david
come
to
think
of
it
we
can
hardly
represent
the
transaction
to
ourselves
in
any
other
way
but
certainly
fixed
and
finished
as
an
elaborate
and
minutely
organised
system
which
comprises
the
sacred
constitution
of
the
congregation
for
all
time
to
come
the
whole
significance
of
moses
consists
in
the
office
of
messenger
which
he
holds
as
mediator
of
the
law
what
else
he
does
is
of
no
importance
that
the
law
is
given
once
for
all
is
the
great
event
of
the
time
not
that
the
people
of
israel
begins
to
appear
on
the
stage
of
the
world
the
people
is
there
for
the
sake
of
the
law
not
the
law
for
the
sake
of
the
people
with
the
jehovist
on
the
contrary
moses
work
consists
in
this
that
he
delivers
his
people
from
the
egyptians
and
cares
for
it
in
every
way
in
the
wilderness
in
the
prelude
scene
from
his
youth
when
he
smites
the
egyptian
and
seeks
to
adjust
the
dispute
of
his
brethren
exodus
ii
seq
his
whole
history
is
prefigured
his
care
for
the
israelites
embraces
both
catering
for
their
sustenance
and
making
and
preserving
peace
and
order
among
them
numbers
the
torah
is
but
a
part
of
his
activity
and
proceeds
from
his
more
general
office
as
the
guardian
of
the
young
people
who
has
as
it
were
to
teach
the
fledgling
to
fly
numbers
xi
according
to
exodus
xviii
his
torah
is
nothing
but
a
giving
of
counsel
a
finding
the
way
out
of
complications
and
difficulties
which
had
actually
arisen
individuals
bring
their
different
cases
before
him
he
pronounces
judgment
or
gives
advice
and
in
so
doing
teaches
the
people
the
way
they
should
go
thus
he
is
the
beginner
of
the
teaching
of
jehovah
which
lives
on
after
him
in
priest
and
prophet
here
all
is
life
and
movement
as
jehovah
himself
so
the
man
of
god
is
working
in
a
medium
which
is
alive
is
working
practically
by
no
means
theoretically
in
history
not
in
literature
his
work
and
activity
may
be
told
in
a
narrative
but
the
contents
of
it
are
more
than
a
system
and
are
not
to
be
reduced
to
a
compendium
it
is
not
done
and
finished
off
it
is
the
beginning
of
a
series
of
infinite
activities
in
the
priestly
code
the
work
of
moses
lies
before
us
clearly
defined
and
rounded
off
one
living
a
thousand
years
after
knows
it
as
well
as
one
who
saw
it
with
his
eyes
it
is
detached
from
its
originator
and
from
his
age
lifeless
itself
it
has
driven
the
life
out
of
moses
and
out
of
the
people
nay
out
of
the
very
deity
this
precipitate
of
history
appearing
as
law
at
the
beginning
of
the
history
stifles
and
kills
the
history
itself
which
of
the
two
views
is
the
more
historical
we
can
accordingly
be
at
no
loss
to
decide
it
may
be
added
that
in
the
older
hebrew
literature
the
founding
of
the
nation
and
not
the
giving
of
the
law
is
regarded
as
the
theocratic
creative
act
of
jehovah
the
very
notion
of
the
law
is
absent
only
covenants
are
spoken
of
in
which
the
representatives
of
the
people
undertake
solemn
obligations
to
do
or
leave
undone
something
which
is
described
in
general
terms
another
point
of
difference
must
be
mentioned
here
though
indeed
it
is
a
matter
which
has
been
before
us
more
than
once
already
that
which
is
in
the
priestly
code
the
of
the
torah
of
moses
namely
the
institution
of
the
cultus
the
jehovist
traces
to
the
practice
of
the
patriarchs
one
more
result
of
the
difference
between
law
and
legend
the
moses
of
the
priestly
code
conflicts
not
only
with
the
future
but
with
the
past
he
comes
into
collision
with
history
on
every
side
that
view
is
manifestly
the
only
natural
one
according
to
which
the
worship
is
not
specifically
israelite
not
a
thing
instituted
by
moses
in
obedience
to
a
sudden
command
of
the
deity
but
an
ancestral
tradition
but
at
the
time
when
the
priestly
code
was
drawn
up
the
worship
was
certainly
the
one
thing
that
made
israel
israel
in
it
the
church
the
one
congregation
of
worship
takes
the
place
of
the
people
even
in
the
mosaic
age
sorely
against
history
but
characteristically
for
the
author
point
of
view
now
even
such
authorities
as
bleek
hupfeld
and
knobel
have
been
misled
by
the
appearance
of
historical
reality
which
the
priestly
code
creates
by
its
learned
art
here
as
well
as
in
the
history
of
the
patriarchs
they
have
regarded
the
multiplicity
of
numbers
and
names
the
minute
technical
descriptions
the
strict
keeping
up
of
the
scenery
of
as
so
many
signs
of
authentic
objectivity
noldeke
made
an
end
of
this
critical
position
once
for
all
but
colenso
is
properly
entitled
to
the
credit
of
having
first
torn
the
web
asunder
see
kuenen
in
the
theol
tijdschrift
the
boldness
with
which
numbers
and
names
are
stated
and
the
preciseness
of
the
details
about
indifferent
matters
of
furniture
do
not
prove
them
to
be
reliable
they
are
not
drawn
from
contemporary
records
but
are
the
fruit
solely
of
late
jewish
fancy
a
fancy
which
it
is
well
known
does
not
design
nor
sketch
but
counts
and
constructs
and
produces
nothing
more
than
barren
plans
without
repeating
the
description
of
the
tabernacle
in
exodus
xxv
word
for
word
it
is
difficult
to
give
an
idea
how
circumstantial
it
is
we
must
go
to
the
source
to
satisfy
ourselves
what
the
narrator
can
do
in
this
line
one
would
imagine
that
he
was
giving
specifications
to
measurers
for
estimates
or
that
he
was
writing
for
and
upholsterers
but
they
could
not
proceed
upon
his
information
for
the
incredibly
statements
are
fancy
all
the
same
as
was
shown
in
chapter
i
the
description
of
the
tabernacle
is
supplemented
in
the
book
of
numbers
by
that
of
the
camp
the
former
being
the
centre
this
is
the
circle
drawn
about
it
and
consists
of
an
outer
ring
the
twelve
secular
tribes
a
middle
ring
the
levites
and
an
innermost
one
the
sons
of
aaron
a
mathematical
demonstration
of
the
theocracy
in
the
wilderness
the
two
first
chapters
contain
the
census
of
the
twelve
tribes
and
their
allocation
in
four
quarters
nothing
but
names
and
numbers
to
this
first
census
chapter
xxxiv
adds
another
at
the
close
of
the
forty
years
in
which
the
various
detailed
figures
are
different
but
the
total
is
about
the
same
this
total
warriors
comes
from
the
older
tradition
but
is
proved
to
be
quite
worthless
by
the
fact
that
in
a
really
authentic
document
the
levy
of
israel
in
the
time
of
deborah
is
stated
to
be
strong
still
the
priestly
code
is
entitled
to
the
credit
of
having
made
the
total
a
little
less
round
and
of
having
broken
it
up
into
artificial
component
parts
the
muster
of
the
people
is
followed
in
numbers
iii
iv
by
the
dedication
of
the
tribe
of
levi
to
the
sanctuary
in
compensation
for
the
firstborn
males
of
the
israelites
who
up
to
that
time
had
not
been
sacrificed
nor
yet
redeemed
there
are
firstborn
males
to
be
provided
for
and
there
are
male
levites
above
a
month
old
the
extra
firstborn
males
are
specially
redeemed
at
five
shekels
a
head
what
accuracy
but
what
of
the
fact
that
a
people
of
at
least
two
millions
has
only
firstborn
males
or
say
firstborn
of
both
sexes
this
gives
an
average
of
forty
children
to
every
woman
for
the
firstborn
in
the
sense
of
the
law
is
that
which
first
opens
the
womb
the
continuation
of
numbers
iii
iv
is
in
chapter
viii
as
the
levites
are
an
offering
of
firstlings
to
the
sanctuary
on
the
part
of
the
people
which
however
is
not
to
be
sacrificed
but
made
over
to
the
priests
the
characteristic
rite
of
this
sort
of
sacred
due
has
to
be
gone
through
with
them
namely
an
act
imitating
that
of
throwing
into
the
flame
of
the
altar
aristeas
to
think
of
moses
and
aaron
heaving
the
men
not
less
striking
as
an
example
of
this
kind
of
fiction
is
the
story
of
numbers
xxxi
twelve
thousand
israelites
a
thousand
from
each
tribe
take
the
field
against
midian
extirpate
without
any
fighting
at
least
nothing
is
anywhere
said
of
this
important
point
the
whole
people
slay
all
the
men
and
a
part
of
the
women
take
captive
the
unmarried
girls
and
suffer
themselves
no
loss
whatever
the
latter
point
is
asserted
very
definitely
the
captains
of
thousands
and
the
captains
of
hundreds
came
to
moses
and
said
to
him
thy
servants
have
taken
the
sum
of
the
men
of
war
which
are
under
our
charge
and
there
lacketh
not
one
of
us
of
the
immeasurable
booty
of
men
and
cattle
jehovah
assigns
half
to
those
who
took
the
field
and
took
part
in
the
battle
the
other
half
to
the
congregation
and
the
former
are
to
give
the
part
to
the
priests
the
latter
the
part
to
the
levites
the
execution
of
this
order
is
especially
reported
as
follows
the
booty
which
the
men
of
war
had
taken
was
sheep
beeves
asses
and
women
that
had
not
lain
by
man
and
the
half
which
was
the
portion
of
them
that
went
out
to
war
was
sheep
and
jehovah
tribute
of
the
sheep
was
beeves
tribute
to
jehovah
asses
tribute
to
jehovah
persons
tribute
to
jehovah
and
moses
gave
the
tribute
to
jehovah
to
eleazar
the
priest
but
the
other
half
which
moses
divided
to
the
children
of
israel
the
half
due
to
the
congregation
was
sheep
beeves
asses
persons
and
of
the
children
of
israel
half
moses
took
one
of
fifty
and
gave
them
to
the
levites
the
calculation
of
the
contribution
to
jehovah
was
quite
easy
for
moses
as
the
part
of
the
half
is
equivalent
to
the
part
of
the
whole
he
had
only
to
leave
off
the
thousands
from
the
first
totals
in
conclusion
the
captains
brought
offerings
to
jehovah
of
golden
dishes
chains
bracelets
rings
and
earrings
altogether
shekels
weight
as
atonement
for
their
souls
but
that
was
only
the
gold
which
the
captains
had
taken
as
booty
for
the
men
of
war
had
taken
spoil
every
man
for
himself
we
may
perhaps
be
allowed
to
speculate
as
to
the
relation
between
these
shekels
which
in
this
passage
the
captains
alone
offer
to
the
tabernacle
of
the
gold
ornaments
of
the
midianites
and
the
shekels
which
in
judges
viii
the
whole
people
dedicate
of
the
gold
ornaments
of
the
midianites
to
set
up
an
image
in
ophra
it
is
less
easy
to
account
on
the
theory
of
pure
fiction
for
the
numerous
names
sometimes
arranged
together
like
a
catalogue
than
for
reported
circumstances
and
numbers
there
can
certainly
be
no
doubt
that
the
forty
places
which
are
mentioned
in
the
list
of
encampments
in
the
wanderings
really
existed
in
the
region
the
israelites
are
reported
to
have
traversed
but
he
who
is
satisfied
with
this
as
evidence
that
we
have
before
us
here
a
historical
document
of
primitive
antiquity
will
never
be
disturbed
by
criticism
was
it
such
a
difficult
matter
to
find
out
forty
definite
stations
in
the
wilderness
for
the
forty
years
of
the
wanderings
even
if
the
elements
of
the
composition
are
not
fictitious
that
is
far
from
proving
the
composition
itself
to
be
authentic
and
in
the
case
of
lists
of
the
names
of
persons
the
elements
are
often
of
an
extremely
doubtful
nature
and
here
it
is
well
to
keep
in
view
the
principle
of
vatke
op
cit
that
no
confidence
is
to
be
placed
in
subjects
devoid
of
predicates
and
that
persons
are
not
to
be
taken
for
real
who
have
nothing
to
do
the
dozens

are
almost
all
made
to
the
same
pattern
and
have
no
similarity
whatever
to
the
names
genuinely
old
the
fact
that
the
name
of
jehovah
does
not
enter
into
their
composition
only
shows
that
the
composer
was
not
forgetful
of
his
theory
by
its
taste
for
barren
names
and
numbers
and
technical
descriptions
the
priestly
code
comes
to
stand
on
the
same
line
with
the
chronicles
and
the
other
literature
of
judaism
which
labours
at
an
artificial
revival
of
the
old
tradition
ad
of
a
piece
with
this
tendency
is
an
indescribable
pedantry
belonging
to
the
very
being
of
the
author
of
the
priestly
code
he
has
a
very
passion
for
classifying
and
drawing
plans
if
he
has
once
dissected
a
genus
into
different
species
we
get
all
the
species
named
to
us
one
by
one
every
time
he
has
occasion
to
mention
the
genus
the
subsuming
use
of
the
prepositions
lamed
and
beth
is
characteristic
of
him
he
selects
a
expression
wherever
he
can
he
does
not
weary
of
repeating
for
the
hundredth
time
what
is
a
matter
of
course
numbers

he
hates
pronouns
and
all
abbreviating
substitutes
what
is
interesting
is
passed
over
what
is
of
no
importance
is
described
with
minuteness
his
exhaustive
clearness
is
such
as
with
its
numerous
details
to
confuse
our
apprehension
of
what
is
in
itself
perfectly
clear
this
is
what
used
to
be
described
in
the
phraseology
of
historical
criticism
as
epic
breadth
riehm
the
style
is
quiet
simple
free
from
all
rhetorical
and
poetical
ornament
and
the
expression
in
speaking
of
similar
objects
has
an
epic
uniformity
impressive
as
many
pieces
are
just
from
their
unassuming
simplicity
and
objectivity
there
is
nowhere
any
apparent
effort
to
produce

to
raise
the

having
thus
attempted
to
describe
the
general
contrast
of
the
priestly
code
and
the
jehovist
in
the
mosaic
period
it
remains
for
us
to
compare
the
several
stories
in
the
two
works
the
exodus
from
egypt
is
everywhere
regarded
as
the
commencement
of
israelite
history
in
the
priestly
code
it
is
made
the
epoch
of
an
era
exodus
xii
which
is
afterwards
dated
from
not
only
in
years
but
even
in
months
and
days
it
is
unquestionable
that
this
precise
style
of
dating
only
came
into
use
among
the
hebrews
at
a
very
late
period
find
in
the
historical
books
only
one
statement
of
the
month
in
which
an
event
took
place
vi
and
in
that
case
the
day
is
not
given
to
the
prophetic
writers
dates
were
of
some
importance
and
the
growth
of
the
practice
may
to
some
extent
be
traced
with
them
amos
first
came
forward
two
years
before
the
earthquake
agh
xv
when
was
dead
the
arabs
dated
after
his
death
to
the
year
of
the
elephant
which
thereafter
was
made
an
epoch
according
to
others
they
reckoned
nine
years
after
the
death
of
hisham
to
the
time
when
they
built
the
caaba
and
then
they
dated
from
the
building
of
the
caaba
comp
the
al
ramada
and
the
al
the
most
precise
date
in
isaiah
is
the
year
in
which
king
uzziah
died
numbers
of
years
are
first
found
in
jeremiah
the
thirteenth
year
of
king
josiah
and
a
few
more
instances
all
at
once
there
was
a
change
haggai
and
zechariah
prophets
who
grew
up
in
the
babylonian
exile
always
give
dates
not
only
the
year
and
month
but
the
day
of
the
month
as
well
in
the
priestly
code
this
precise
reckoning
which
the
jews
obviously
learned
from
the
chaldeans
is
in
use
from
the
age
of
moses
onwards
in
the
jehovist
the
ostensible
occasion
of
the
exodus
is
a
festival
which
the
children
of
israel
desire
to
hold
in
honour
of
their
god
in
the
wilderness
in
the
priestly
code
this
occasion
disappears
there
can
be
no
festivals
but
with
this
the
reason
falls
away
for
which
jehovah
kills
the
firstborn
of
the
egyptians
he
does
it
because
the
king
of
egypt
is
keeping
from
him
the
firstborn
of
the
israelites
which
ought
to
be
offered
to
him
at
the
festival
for
the
celebration
in
question
is
the
sacrificial
festival
of
the
of
cattle
in
spring
in
the
older
tradition
the
festival
is
the
first
thing
it
explains
the
circumstances
of
the
exodus
and
the
time
of
year
at
which
it
took
place
in
the
later
one
the
relation
is
reversed
the
killing
of
the
firstborn
of
the
egyptians
leads
to
the
sacrifice
of
the
firstborn
of
israel
the
exodus
in
spring
is
followed
by
the
festival
in
spring
as
its
consequence
the
priestly
code
follows
this
younger
tradition
and
deviates
from
the
original
account
still
more
widely
in
the
view
it
gives
of
the
passover
it
obliterates
completely
the
connection
between
the
passover
and
the
sacrifice
of
the
firstborn
and
represents
it
not
as
a
giving
of
thanks
to
jehovah
for
having
slain
the
firstborn
of
egypt
but
as
instituted
at
the
moment
of
the
exodus
to
induce
jehovah
to
spare
the
firstborn
of
israel
how
all
this
is
to
be
understood
and
judged
of
we
have
discussed
more
at
large
in
the
chapter
on
the
festivals
as
to
the
accounts
given
in
the
two
sources
of
the
crossing
of
the
red
sea
all
we
can
say
is
that
that
of
the
jehovist
j
is
the
more
complicated
according
to
him
the
sea
is
dried
up
by
a
strong
wind
and
the
egyptians
succeed
at
first
in
crossing
it
and
encounter
the
hebrews
on
the
eastern
shore
during
he
night
but
in
the
morning
watch
jehovah
turned
in
the
pillar
of
fire
and
of
the
cloud
against
the
host
of
the
egyptian
and
overthrew
the
host
of
the
egyptian
and
hindered
the
wheels
of
his
chariot
and
caused
him
to
drive
heavily
then
the
egyptian
said
i
will
flee
before
israel
for
jehovah
fighteth
for
them
against
egypt
but
the
sea
turned
back
towards
morning
to
its
ordinary
level
and
the
egyptians
fled
against
it
and
jehovah
shook
them
into
the
midst
of
the
sea
exodus
xiv
according
to
the
priestly
code
the
waves
meet
over
the
pursuers
and
the
younger
tradition
generally
also
according
to
the
song
exodus
which
apart
from
the
beginning
which
is
old
is
a
psalm
in
the
manner
of
the
psalms
and
has
no
similarity
with
the
historical
songs
judges
numbers
xxi
before
they
reach
the
further
shore
the
idea
is
much
simpler
but
poorer
in
incidental
features
the
miracle
of
the
manna
exodus
xvi
is
taken
advantage
of
in
the
priestly
code
as
a
very
suitable
occasion
for
urging
on
the
people
a
strict
sanctification
of
the
sabbath
none
falls
on
the
seventh
day
but
what
is
gathered
on
the
sixth
keeps
two
days
while
at
other
times
it
requires
to
be
eaten
quite
fresh
this
pursuit
of
a
legal
object
destroys
the
story
and
obscures
its
original
meaning
as
no
one
can
help
seeing
nor
is
it
any
sign
of
originality
rather
of
senility
that
in
the
priestly
code
the
manna
is
not
eaten
raw
but
boiled
and
baked
at
mount
sinai
moses
receives
according
to
the
priestly
code
the
revelation
of
the
model
of
the
tabernacle
and
he
follows
the
pattern
thus
presented
to
him
in
the
construction
down
below
of
the
real
tabernacle
all
further
revelation
takes
place
even
in

as
far
as
possible
in
the

even

note
the
tables
of
the

it
appears
are
silently
presupposed
without
being
mentioned
beforehand
it
being
of
course
assumed
that
the
readers
would
know
all
about
them
from
the
old
tradition
the
outside
of
the
ark
however
is
furnished
in
the
most
extravagant
style
and
with
a
splendour
which
other
descriptions
of
the
chest
of
are
far
from
suggesting
the
ark
in
the
priestly
code
differs
indeed
in
every
way
from
the
appearance
of
it
in
vii
seq
we
are
reminded
of
the
haggada
by
the
covering
which
moses
has
to
put
before
his
face
which
is
shining
with
the
reflection
of
the
glory
of

by

making
of

cf

these
traits
do
not
it
is
true
belong
to
the
original
contents
of
the
priestly
code
but
they
belong
to
its
circle
from
sinai
the
old
tradition
takes
us
by
this
and
that
station
mentioned
by
name
without
delay
to
kadesh
here
the
chief
part
of
the
forty
years
sojourn
in
the
wilderness
is
spent
this
as
we
said
before
is
the
true
scene
of
all
the
stories
that
are
told
about
moses
the
priestly
code
takes
us
in
this
period
as
in
the
legend
of
the
patriarchs
not
to
definite
places
but
up
and
down
in
the
wilderness
of
sinai
in
the
wilderness
of
paran
in
the
wilderness
of
sin
kadesh
is
with
evident
intention
thrust
as
far
as
possible
into
the
background
no
doubt
on
account
of
the
high
sanctity
the
place
originally
had
as
the
encampment
for
many
years
of
the
israelites
under
moses
the
spies
are
sent
out
according
to
the
jehovist
from
kadesh
according
to
the
priestly
code
from
the
wilderness
of
paran
in
the
former
authority
they
penetrate
to
hebron
whence
they
bring
back
with
them
fine
grapes
but
they
find
that
the
land
where
these
grow
is
not
to
be
conquered
in
the
latter
they
proceed
without
any
difficulty
throughout
the
whole
of
palestine
to
lebanon
but
have
nothing
to
bring
back
with
them
and
advise
against
attacking
the
land
because
they
have
not
found
it
particularly
desirable
as
if
its
advantages
had
been
accessible
to
faith
alone
and
not
to
be
discovered
by
unbelieving
eyes
as
was
actually
the
case
in
the
time
of
haggai
and
zechariah
and
at
the
time
of
ezra
and
nehemiah
to
the
genuine
israelite
of
old
however
the
goodness
of
his
beloved
land
was
not
a
mere
point
of
faith
which
he
could
ever
have
doubted
in
the
former
source
as
we
judge
from
deuteronomy
i
only
the
number
of
the
spies
was
given
in
the
latter
all
the
twelve
are
named
in
the
former
caleb
is
the
only
good
spy
in
the
latter
caleb
and
joshua
at
first
probably
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
belonged
to
this
story
but
caleb
easily
came
to
be
named
as
an
exception
because
he
actually
conquered
the
district
from
kadesh
to
hebron
which
the
spies
had
declared
it
impossible
to
take
and
which
the
israelites
alarmed
by
their
account
had
not
ventured
to
attack
joshua
again
was
added
from
the
consideration
that
according
to
the
principle
enunciated
by
the
jehovist
in
numbers
xiv
he
must
have
shared
the
merit
of
caleb
because
he
partook
of
the
same
exceptional
reward
with
him
in
the
jehovist
moses
alone
instructs
the
spies
and
receives
their
report
on
their
return
in
the
priestly
code
moses
and
aaron
do
so
in
the
oldest
source
of
the
jehovist
j
aaron
has
not
yet
made
his
appearance
in
the
priestly
code
moses
must
not
do
any
public
act
without
him
in
the
same
way
in
the
former
source
joshua
always
acts
alone
in
the
latter
he
always
has
the
priest
eleazar
at
his
side
compare
notes
in
moses
is
still
the
moving
spirit
here
as
well
as
there
but
aaron
is
the
representative
of
the
theocracy
and
pains
are
taken
to
secure
that
he
shall
never
be
absent
where
the
representatives
of
the
theocracy
are
brought
face
to
face
with
the
community
the
desire
to
introduce
the
leader
of
the
hierocracy
and
with
its
leader
the
hierocracy
itself
into
the
mosaic
history
has
borne
the
most
remarkable
fruits
in
the
story
of
the
rebellion
of
the
company
of
korah
according
to
the
jehovistic
tradition
the
rebellion
proceeds
from
the
reubenites
dathan
and
abiram
prominent
members
of
the
firstborn
tribe
of
israel
and
is
directed
against
moses
as
leader
and
judge
of
the
people
according
to
the
version
of
the
of
the
priestly
code
q
the
author
of
the
agitation
is
korah
a
prince
of
the
tribe
of
judah
and
he
rebels
not
only
against
moses
but
against
moses
and
aaron
as
representing
the
priesthood
in
a
later
addition
which
to
judge
from
its
style
belongs
likewise
to
the
priestly
code
but
not
to
its
original
contents
the
levite
korah
appears
at
the
head
of
a
revolt
of
the
levites
against
aaron
as
high
priest
and
demands
the
equalisation
of
the
lower
with
the
higher
clergy
starting
from
the
jehovistic
version
the
historical
basis
of
which
is
dimly
discerned
to
be
the
fall
of
reuben
from
its
old
place
at
the
head
of
the
we
have
no
difficulty
in
seeing
how
the
second
version
arose
out
of
it
the
people
of
the
congregation
of
the
church
having
once
come
on
the
scene
the
spiritual
heads
moses
and
aaron
take
the
place
of
the
popular
leader
moses
and
the
jealousy
of
the
secular
grandees
is
now
directed
against
the
class
of
hereditary
priests
instead
of
against
the
extraordinary
influence
on
the
community
of
a
hero
all
these
changes
are
the
natural
outcome
of
the
importation
of
the
hierocracy
into
mosaic
times
from
the
second
version
we
can
go
further
and
understand
the
origin
of
the
third
in
the
earlier
version
the
princes
of
the
tribe
of
reuben
were
forced
to
give
way
to
a
prince
of
the
tribe
of
judah
in
the
progress
of
time
korah
the
prince
of
the
tribe
of
judah
is
replaced
by
the
eponymous
head
of
a
levitical
family
of
the
same
name
the
contest
between
clergy
and
aristocracy
is
here
transformed
into
a
domestic
strife
between
the
higher
and
the
inferior
clergy
which
was
no
doubt
raging
in
the
time
of
the
narrator
thus
the
three
versions
are
developed
the
origin
and
collocation
of
which
appears
from
every
other
point
of
view
to
be
an
insoluble
enigma
the
one
arises
out
of
the
other
in
the
direct
line
of
descent
the
metamorphoses
took
place
under
the
influence
of
great
historical
changes
which
are
well
known
to
us
and
in
the
light
of
jewish
history
from
josiah
downwards
they
are
by
no
means
unintelligible
the
details
of
the
demonstration
will
be
found
in
the
jahrbb
fuer
deutsche
theologie
note
and
in
the
leyden
theol
tijdschrift
seq
we
come
to
the
migration
of
the
israelites
to
the
land
east
of
the
jordan
according
to
the
jehovist
the
neighbouring
tribes
place
obstacles
in
their
way
and
the
land
in
which
they
desire
to
settle
has
to
be
conquered
with
the
sword
the
priestly
code
tells
us
as
little
of
all
this
as
in
an
earlier
instance
of
the
war
with
amalek
from
all
it
says
we
should
imagine
that
the
israelites
went
straight
to
their
mark
and
met
with
no
difficulty
in
the
region
in
question
the
land
is
ownerless
and
the
possession
of
it
is
granted
by
moses
and
eleazar
to
the
two
tribes
reuben
and
gad
numbers
but
that
war
may
not
be
completely
wanting
under
moses
we
have
afterwards
the
war
with
the
midianites
on
which
we
have
already
commented
numbers
there
is
not
much
story
about
it
only
numbers
and
directions
and
in
verse
there
is
a
suspicion
of
xxx
as
if
that
passage
were
the
groundwork
of
the
whole
the
passage
is
extremely
interesting
as
showing
us
the
views
taken
of
war
by
the
jews
of
the
later
time
who
had
grown
quite
unaccustomed
to
it
the
occasion
of
the
war
also
is
noticeable
it
is
undertaken
not
for
the
acquisition
of
territory
nor
with
any
other
practical
object
but
only
to
take
vengeance
on
the
midianites
for
having
seduced
some
of
the
israelites
to
uncleanness
the
elders
of
midian
so
the
story
goes
went
to
the
soothsayer
balaam
to
ask
his
advice
as
to
what
should
be
done
against
the
israelite
invaders
he
suggested
a
means
by
which
the
edge
of
the
invasion
might
be
broken
the
midianites
should
give
their
daughters
to
the
israelites
for
wives
and
so
deprive
the
holy
people
of
their
strength
the
secret
of
which
lay
in
their
isolation
from
other
peoples
the
midianites
took
balaam
advice
and
succeeded
in
entangling
many
of
the
israelites
with
the
charms
of
their
women
in
consequence
of
which
jehovah
visited
the
faithless
people
with
a
severe
plague
the
narrative
of
the
priestly
code
up
to
this
point
has
to
be
pieced
together
from
numbers
xxxi
and
joshua
xiii
and
from
what
is
implied
in
the
sequel
of
it
at
this
point
the
portion
of
it
begins
which
is
preserved
to
us
numbers
xxv
seq
and
we
are
told
how
the
plague
was
ultimately
stayed
a
certain
man
coolly
brings
a
midianitish
woman
into
the
camp
before
the
very
eyes
of
moses
and
the
weeping
children
of
israel
then
the
young
hereditary
priest
phinehas
takes
a
spear
transfixes
the
godless
pair
and
by
this
zeal
averts
the
anger
of
jehovah
this
narrative
is
based
on
the
jehovistic
one
which
is
also
preserved
to
us
only
in
part
numbers
xxv
about
the
backsliding
of
israel
in
the
camp
of
shittim
to
the
service
of
to
which
they
were
seduced
by
the
daughters
of
moab
in
the
priestly
code
the
idolatry
has
quite
disappeared
all
but
some
unconscious
reminiscences
and
no
sin
is
alleged
but
that
of
whoredom
which
in
the
original
story
merely
led
up
to
the
main
offence
this
is
done
manifestly
with
the
idea
that
marriage
with
foreign
women
is
in
itself
a
falling
away
from
jehovah
a
breach
of
the
covenant
this
change
was
extremely
suitable
to
the
circumstances
of
exilic
and
judaism
for
in
these
later
days
there
was
no
immediate
danger
of
gross
idolatry
but
it
took
a
good
deal
of
trouble
to
prevent
heathenism
from
making
its
way
into
the
midst
of
the
people
under
the
friendly
form
of
mixed
marriages
the
version
of
tbe
priestly
code
however
mixes
up
with
the
story
of
the
jehovist
the
figure
of
balaam
which
is
also
borrowed
from
the
jehovist
but
entirely
transformed
in
the
process
in
the
form
under
which
he
appears
in
the
early
history
he
transgresses
all
the
ideas
of
the
priestly
code
an
aramaean
seer
who
is
hired
for
money
and
makes
all
sorts
of
heathen
preparations
to
prophesy
but
who
yet
is
not
an
impostor
but
a
true
prophet
as
much
as
any
in
israel
who
even
stands
in
the
most
intimate
relations
with
jehovah
though
cherishing
the
intention
of
cursing
jehovah
people
that
is
too
much
for
exclusive
judaism
the
correction
is
effected
by
the
simple
device
of
connecting
balaam
with
the
following
section
and
making
him
the
intellectual
instigator
of
the
devilry
of
the
midianitish
women
and
in
this
new
form
which
he
assumes
in
the
priestly
code
he
lives
on
in
the
haggada
the
reason
for
changing
the
moabites
into
midianites
is
not
made
clear
but
the
fact
is
undoubted
that
the
midianites
never
lived
in
that
part
of
the
world
in
the
book
of
numbers
the
narrative
sections
which
are
in
the
style
and
colour
of
the
priestly
code
have
more
and
more
the
character
of
mere
additions
and
editorial
supplements
to
a
connection
which
was
already
there
and
had
a
different
origin
the
independent
main
stock
of
the
priestly
code
the
book
of
the
four
covenants
or
the
book
of
origins
q
more
and
more
gives
way
to
later
additions
and
ceases
altogether
it
appears
at
the
death
of
moses
it
is
at
least
nowhere
to
be
traced
in
the
first
half
of
the
book
of
joshua
and
so
we
can
not
reckon
as
part
of
it
those
extensive
sections
of
the
second
half
belonging
to
the
priestly
code
which
treat
of
the
division
of
the
land
without
a
preceding
history
of
the
conquest
these
sections
are
quite
in
the
air
they
can
not
be
taken
as
telling
a
continuous
story
of
their
own
but
presuppose
the
work
in
spite
of
distaste
to
war
and
to
records
of
war
xxii
xxviii
an
independent
work
like
the
book
of
the
four
covenants
could
not
possibly
have
passed
over
the
wars
of
joshua
in
silence
a
comparison
of
the
different
accounts
of
the
entry
of
the
israelite
tribes
into
the
occupation
of
the
conquered
land
may
close
this
discussion
the
priestly
code
agreeing
in
this
with
the
deuteronomistic
revision
represents
the
whole
of
canaan
as
having
been
made
a
and
then
masterless
and
denuded
of
population
submitted
to
the
lot
first
the
tribe
of
judah
receives
its
lot
then
manasseh
and
ephraim
then
the
two
tribes
which
attached
themselves
to
ephraim
and
judah
benjamin
and
simeon
and
lastly
the
five
northern
tribes
zebulon
issachar
asher
naphtali
dan
these
are
the
inheritances
which
eleazar
the
priest
and
joshua
ben
nun
and
the
heads
of
the
tribes
of
the
children
of
israel
divided
for
an
inheritance
by
lot
in
shiloh
before
jehovah
at
the
door
of
the
tabernacle
according
to
the
jehovist
judah
and
joseph
appear
to
have
had
their
territory
allocated
to
them
at
gilgal
xiv
and
not
by
lot
and
to
have
entered
into
occupation
of
it
from
there
a
good
while
afterwards
the
land
remaining
over
is
divided
by
lot
among
the
seven
small
tribes
still
unprovided
for
from
shiloh
or
perhaps
originally
from
shechem
xviii
joshua
alone
casts
the
lot
and
gives
instructions
eleazar
the
priest
does
not
act
with
him
even
here
the
general
principle
of
the
priestly
code
which
knows
no
differences
among
the
tribes
is
somewhat
limited
but
it
is
much
more
decidedly
contradicted
by
the
important
chapter
judges
i
the
chapter
is
in
fact
not
a
continuation
of
the
book
of
joshua
at
all
but
a
parallel
to
it
which
while
it
presupposes
the
conquest
of
the
lands
does
not
speak
of
the
lands
as
conquered
but
tells
the
story
of
the
conquest
and
that
in
a
manner
somewhat
differing
from
the
other
source
from
gilgal
where
the
angel
of
jehovah
first
set
up
his
tent
the
tribes
march
out
one
by
one
to
conquer
their
lot
by
fighting
first
judah
then
joseph
we
hear
only
of
these
two
and
with
regard
to
joseph
we
only
hear
of
the
very
beginning
of
the
conquest
of
his
land
there
is
no
mention
of
joshua
nor
would
his
figure
as
of
israel
suit
the
view
here
given
of
the
situation
though
it
would
very
well
admit
of
him
as
leader
of
his
tribe
the
incompleteness
of
the
conquest
is
acknowledged
unreservedly
the
canaanites
lived
on
quietly
in
the
cities
of
the
plain
and
not
till
the
period
of
the
monarchy
when
israel
had
grown
strong
were
they
subdued
and
made
tributary
this
chapter
as
well
as
the
main
stem
of
the
book
of
judges
corresponds
to
the
jehovistic
stratum
of
the
tradition
to
which
also
passages
in
joshua
of
an
identical
or
similar
import
may
be
added
without
hesitation
the
angel
of
jehovah
is
enough
to
tell
us
this
the
difference
which
exists
between
it
and
the
jehovistic
main
version
in
the
book
of
joshua
is
to
be
explained
for
the
most
part
by
the
fact
that
the
latter
is
of
ephraimite
origin
and
in
consequence
ascribes
the
conquest
of
the
whole
land
to
the
hero
of
ephraim
or
of
joseph
while
judges
leans
more
to
the
tribe
of
judah
moreover
we
find
in
the
book
of
joshua
itself
the
remnant
of
a
version
ix
in
which
just
as
in
judges
the
actors
are
the
men
of
israel
who
ask
counsel
of
the
mouth
of
jehovah
while
elsewhere
joshua
alone
has
anything
to
say
being
the
successor
of
moses
and
drawing
his
decisions
from
no
source
but
the
authority
of
his
own
spirit
and
finally
we
have
to
consider
exodus
where
also
there
is
a
correspondence
with
judges
in
the
fact
that
not
joshua
but
the
angel
of
jehovah
judges
is
the
leader
of
israel
and
that
the
promised
land
is
not
conquered
all
at
once
but
gradually
in
the
process
of
time
judges
presents
certain
anachronisms
and
is
partly
made
up
of
anecdotes
but
these
should
not
prevent
us
from
acknowledging
that
the
general
view
given
in
this
chapter
of
the
process
of
the
conquest
is
when
judged
by
what
we
know
of
the
subsequent
period
of
israel
incomparably
more
historical
than
that
in
the
book
of
joshua
where
the
whole
thing
is
done
at
once
with
systematic
thoroughness
the
whole
land
being
first
denuded
of
its
inhabitants
and
then
divided
by
lot
among
the
different
tribes
the
latter
view
may
have
come
about
partly
from
a
literal
interpretation
of
lot
judges
xviii
an
expression
which
properly
applies
to
the
farm
of
a
family
but
is
here
used
for
the
territory
of
a
tribe
it
was
also
favoured
no
doubt
by
the
tendency
to
compress
a
long
development
into
its
first
great
act
and
as
this
tendency
is
carried
out
with
the
greatest
thoroughness
in
the
priestly
code
that
document
stands
furthest
from
the
origin
of
the
tradition
the
same
conclusion
is
led
up
in
the
deuteronomistic
revision
joshua
xxi
there
is
still
a
trace
of
hesitation
a
certain
difficulty
in
parting
with
the
old
view
altogether
deuteronomy
vii
judg
iii
and
besides
the
motives
for
the
change
are
much
plainer
here
the
canaanites
are
extirpated
to
guard
against
the
infection
of
the
new
settlers
with
their
idolatary
to
by
the
circumstance
that
the
tribe
of
joseph
is
never
mentioned
one
of
the
two
tribes
ephraim
and
manasseh
being
always
spoken
of
instead
and
that
these
two
tribes
are
almost
put
out
of
sight
by
judah
and
yet
joshua
the
leader
of
ephraim
is
leader
here
also
of
all
israel
having
been
preserved
from
the
old
original
tradition
which
was
ephraimitic
it
involves
no
contradiction
that
in
comparing
the
versions
of
the
tradition
we
should
decline
the
historical
standard
in
the
case
of
the
legend
of
the
origins
of
mankind
and
of
the
legend
of
the
patriarchs
while
we
employ
it
to
a
certain
extent
for
the
epic
period
of
moses
and
joshua
the
epic
tradition
certainly
contains
elements
which
can
not
be
explained
on
any
other
hypothesis
than
that
there
are
historical
facts
underlying
them
its
source
is
in
the
period
it
deals
with
while
the
patriarchal
legend
has
no
connection
whatever
with
the
times
of
the
patriarchs
this
justifies
the
difference
of
treatment
some
isolated
statements
there
are
here
also
to
which
the
historical
standard
may
be
applied
we
may
call
it
a
more
accurate
representation
that
hebron
was
inhabited
in
the
time
of
abraham
by
the
canaanites
and
perizzites
than
that
the
hittites
dwelt
there
at
that
time
the
latter
according
to
xxiv
bleek
einleitung
edition
pp
dwelt
in
and
according
to
vii
in
the
neihbourhood
of
the
aramaeans
of
damascus
the
statement
that
the
israelites
received
from
pharaoh
because
they
were
shepherds
the
of
goshen
on
the
frontier
of
egypt
and
there
dwelt
by
themselves
is
to
be
preferred
to
the
statement
that
they
were
settled
among
the
egyptians
in
the
best
part
of
the
land
our
last
result
is
still
the
same
whether
tried
by
the
standard
of
poetry
or
by
that
of
history
the
priestly
code
stands
both
in
value
and
in
time
far
below
the
jehovist
in
rough
strokes
i
have
sought
to
place
before
the
reader
view
the
contrast
between
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
tradition
of
the
hexateuch
it
would
not
be
impossible
to
trace
the
inner
development
of
the
tradition
in
the
intermediate
stages
between
the
two
extremities
to
do
this
we
should
have
to
make
use
of
the
more
delicate
results
of
the
process
of
and
to
call
to
our
aid
the
hints
not
numerous
indeed
but
important
which
are
to
be
found
in
deuteronomy
and
in
the
historical
and
prophetical
books
especially
hosea
it
would
appear
that
legend
from
its
very
nature
causes
those
who
deal
with
it
to
strike
out
variations
that
it
can
not
be
represented
objectively
at
all
even
at
the
first
act
of
reducing
it
to
writing
the
discolouring
influences
are
at
work
without
any
violence
being
done
to
the
meaning
which
dwells
in
the
matter
we
can
trace
first
of
all
the
influence
on
the
tradition
of
that
specific
prophetism
which
we
are
able
to
follow
from
amos
onwards
this
is
least
traceable
in
the
old
main
source
of
the
jehovist
in
j
and
yet
it
is
remarkable
that
the
asheras
never
occur
in
the
worship
of
the
patriarchs
the
second
jehovistic
source
e
breathes
the
air
of
the
prophets
much
more
markedly
and
shows
a
more
advanced
and
religiosity
significant
in
this
view
are
the
introduction
of
abraham
as
a
nabi
jacob
burying
the
teraphim
the
view
taken
of
the
macceba
at
shechem
jos
xxiv
and
above
all
the
story
of
the
golden
calf
the
deity
appears
less
primitive
than
in
j
and
does
not
approach
men
in
bodily
form
but
calls
to
them
from
heaven
or
appears
to
them
in
dreams
the
religious
element
has
become
more
refined
but
at
the
same
time
more
energetic
and
has
laid
hold
even
of
elements
heterogeneous
to
itself
producing
on
occasion
such
strange
mixtures
as
that
in
genesis
xxxi
then
the
law
comes
in
and
leavens
the
jehovistic
narrative
first
the
deuteronomic
in
genesis
even
and
then
quite
strongly
in
exodus
and
joshua
while
last
of
all
in
the
priestly
code
under
the
influence
of
the
legislation
of
the
restoration
there
is
brought
about
a
complete
metamorphosis
of
the
old
tradition
the
law
is
the
key
to
the
understanding
even
of
the
narrative
of
the
priestly
code
all
the
distinctive
peculiarities
of
the
work
are
connected
with
the
influence
of
the
law
everywhere
we
hear
the
voice
of
theory
rule
judgment
what
was
said
above
of
the
cultus
may
be
repeated
word
for
word
of
the
legend
in
the
early
time
it
may
be
likened
to
the
green
tree
which
grows
out
of
the
ground
as
it
will
and
can
at
a
later
time
it
is
dry
wood
that
is
cut
and
made
to
a
pattern
with
compass
and
square
it
is
an
extraordinary
objection
to
this
when
it
is
said
that
the
period
had
no
genius
for
productions
such
as
the
tabernacle
or
the
chronology
it
certainly
was
not
an
original
age
but
the
matter
was
all
there
in
writing
and
did
not
require
to
be
invented
what
great
genius
was
needed
to
transform
the
temple
into
a
portable
tent
what
sort
of
creative
power
is
that
which
brings
forth
nothing
but
numbers
and
names
in
connection
with
such
an
age
there
can
be
no
question
at
least
of
youthful
freshness
with
infinitely
greater
justice
may
it
be
maintained
that
such
theoretical
modelling
and
adaptation
of
the
legend
as
is
practiced
in
the
priestly
code
could
only
gain
an
entrance
when
the
legend
had
died
away
from
the
memory
and
the
heart
of
the
people
and
was
dead
at
the
root
the
history
of
the
and
the
epic
tradition
thus
passed
through
the
same
stages
as
that
of
the
historic
and
in
this
parallel
the
priestly
code
answers
both
as
a
whole
and
in
every
detail
to
the
chronicles
the
connecting
link
between
old
and
new
between
israel
and
judaism
is
everywhere
deuteronomy
the
says
of
itself
that
it
had
attained
an
age
of
years
years
of
which
it
had
spent
in
the
age
of
ignorance
old
arabic
heathenism
and
the
other
in
islam
the
historical
books
of
the
bible
might
say
something
similar
if
they
were
personified
and
their
life
considered
to
begin
with
the
reduction
to
writing
of
the
oldest
kernel
of
the
tradition
and
to
close
with
the
last
great
revision
the
time
of
ignorance
would
extend
to
the
appearance
of
the
book
which
it
is
true
did
not
in
the
old
testament
come
down
from
heaven
all
at
once
like
the
koran
but
came
into
existence
during
a
longer
period
and
passed
through
various
phases
israel
and
judaism
the

conclusion
of
the
criticism
of
the
law
objections
have
been
made
to
the
general
style
of
the
proof
on
which
graf
hypothesis
is
based
it
is
said
to
be
an
illicit
argument
to
conclude
from
the
fact
that
the
priestly
legislation
is
latent
in
ezekiel
where
it
should
be
in
operation
unknown
where
it
should
be
known
that
in
his
time
it
had
not
yet
come
into
existence
but
what
would
the
objectors
have
do
they
expect
to
find
positive
statements
of
the
of
what
had
not
yet
come
into
being
is
it
more
rational
to
deduce
as
they
do
a
positive
proof
that
it
did
exist
say
that
as
there
are
no
traces
of
the
hierocracy
in
the
times
of
the
judges
and
the
kings
it
must
have
originated
in
the
most
remote
antiquity
with
moses
the
problem
would
in
this
case
still
be
the
same
namely
to
explain
how
it
is
that
with
and
after
the
exile
the
hierocracy
begins
to
come
into
practical
activity
what
the
opponents
of
graf
hypothesis
call
its
argument
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
universally
valid
method
of
historical
investigation
the
protest
against
the
argument
takes
another
form
it
is
pointed
out
that
laws
are
in
many
cases
theories
and
that
it
is
no
disproof
of
the
existence
of
a
theory
that
it
has
not
got
itself
carried
out
into
practice
deuteronomy
was
really
nothing
more
than
a
theory
during
the
period
but
who
would
argue
from
this
that
it
was
not
there
at
all
though
laws
are
not
kept
this
does
not
prove
they
are
not
there
provided
that
is
to
say
that
there
is
sufficient
proof
of
their
existence
on
other
grounds
but
these
other
proofs
of
the
existence
of
the
priestly
code
are
not
to
be
found
not
a
trace
of
them
it
is
moreover
rarely
the
case
with
laws
that
they
are
theory
and
nothing
more
the
possibility
that
a
thing
may
be
mere
theory
is
not
to
be
asserted
generally
but
only
in
particular
cases
and
even
where
law
is
undoubtedly
theory
the
fact
does
not
prevent
us
from
fixing
its
position
in
history
even
legislative
fancy
always
proceeds
upon
some
definite
presupposition
or
other
and
these
presuppositions
rather
than
the
laws
themselves
must
guide
the
steps
of
historical
criticism
cf
ad
this
is
the
reason
why
the
strata
of
the
tradition
require
to
be
compared
as
carefully
as
those
of
the
law
an
argument
which
is
the
very
opposite
of
this
is
also
urged
the
fact
is
insisted
on
that
the
laws
of
the
priestly
code
are
actually
attested
everywhere
in
the
practice
of
the
historical
period
that
there
were
always
sacrifices
and
festivals
priests
and
purifications
and
everything
of
the
kind
in
early
israel
these
statements
must
though
this
seems
scarcely
possible
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
on
graf
hypothesis
the
whole
cultus
was
invented
all
at
once
by
the
priestly
code
and
only
introduced
after
the
exile
but
the
defenders
of
hypothesis
do
not
go
so
far
as
to
believe
that
the
israelite
cultus
entered
the
world
of
a
sudden
as
little
by
ezekiel
or
by
ezra
as
by
moses
else
why
should
they
be
accused
of
darwinism
by
zoeckler
and
delitzsch
they
merely
consider
that
the
works
of
the
law
were
done
before
the
law
that
there
is
a
difference
between
traditional
usage
and
formulated
law
and
that
even
where
this
difference
appears
to
be
only
in
form
it
yet
has
a
material
basis
being
connected
with
the
centralisation
of
the
worship
and
the
hierocracy
which
that
centralisation
called
into
existence
here
also
the
important
point
is
not
the
matter
but
the
spirit
which
is
behind
it
and
may
everywhere
be
recognised
as
the
spirit
of
the
age
at
one
period
or
another
comp
all
these
objections
meanwhile
labour
under
the
same
defect
namely
that
they
leave
out
of
view
that
which
is
the
real
point
at
issue
the
point
is
not
to
prove
that
the
mosaic
law
was
not
in
force
in
the
period
before
the
exile
there
are
in
the
pentateuch
three
strata
of
law
and
three
strata
of
tradition
and
the
problem
is
to
place
them
in
their
true
historical
order
so
far
as
the
jehovist
and
deuteronomy
are
concerned
the
problem
has
found
a
solution
which
may
be
said
to
be
accepted
universally
and
all
that
remains
is
to
apply
to
the
priestly
code
also
the
procedure
by
which
the
succession
and
the
date
of
these
two
works
has
been
determined
that
procedure
consisting
in
the
comparison
of
them
with
the
ascertained
facts
of
israelite
history
the
method
is
stated
in
the
introduction
and
special
pains
are
taken
to
bring
it
out
distinctly
in
the
first
chapter
that
about
the
place
of
worship
one
would
imagine
that
this
could
not
be
objected
to
but
objections
have
been
raised
the
procedure
which
when
applied
to
deuteronomy
is
called
method
is
called
when
applied
to
the
priestly
code
construction
of
history
but
history
it
is
well
known
has
always
to
be
constructed
the
order
priestly
code
jehovist
deuteronomy
is
not
a
thing
handed
down
by
tradition
or
prescribed
by
the
nature
of
the
case
but
a
hypothesis
as
yet
only
a
score
of
years
old
or
thereby
the
reasons
for
which
were
somewhat
incomprehensible
so
that
people
have
forgotten
them
and
begun
to
regard
the
hypothesis
as
something
objective
partaking
of
the
character
of
dogma
the
question
is
whether
one
constructs
well
or
count
baudissin
thinks
a
grave
warning
necessary
of
a
certain
danger
that
namely
of
an
exaggerated
application
of
logic
that
the
laws
follow
each
other
in
a
certain
order
logically
he
says
does
not
prove
that
they
appeared
in
the
same
order
in
history
but
it
is
not
for
the
sake
of
logical
sequence
that
we
consider
the
development
which
began
with
the
prophets
to
have
issued
finally
in
the
laws
of
cultus
and
those
who
set
out
from
sound
human
reason
have
generally
forced
the
reverse
process
of
this
on
the
history
in
spite
of
the
traces
which
have
come
down
to
us
and
which
point
the
other
way
and
it
would
not
be
surprising
when
we
consider
the
whole
character
of
the
polemic
against
graf
hypothesis
if
the
next
objection
should
be
the
very
opposite
of
the
above
viz
that
it
is
not
able
to
construct
the
history
after
laboriously
collecting
the
data
offered
by
the
historical
and
prophetical
books
we
constructed
a
sketch
of
the
israelite
history
of
worship
we
then
compared
the
pentateuch
with
this
sketch
and
recognised
that
one
element
of
the
pentateuch
bore
a
definite
relation
to
this
phase
of
the
history
of
worship
and
another
element
of
the
pentateuch
to
that
phase
of
it
this
is
not
putting
logic
in
the
place
of
historical
investigation
the
new
doctrine
of
the
irrationality
of
what
exists
is
surely
not
to
be
pushed
so
far
as
that
we
should
regard
the
correspondence
between
an
element
of
the
law
and
a
particular
phase
of
the
history
as
a
reason
for
placing
the
two
as
far
as
possible
asunder
at
least
this
principle
would
have
to
be
applied
to
the
jehovist
and
deuteronomy
too
and
not
to
the
priestly
code
only
what
is
right
in
the
one
case
is
fair
in
the
other
too
a
little
logic
unfortunately
is
almost
unavoidable
not
everything
that
i
have
brought
forward
in
the
history
of
the
cultus
and
the
tradition
is
a
proof
of
the
hypothesis
there
is
much
that
serves
merely
to
explain
phenomena
at
the
basis
of
the
hypothesis
and
can
not
be
used
as
proving
it
this
is
a
matter
of
course
my
procedure
has
intentionally
differed
from
that
of
graf
in
this
respect
he
brought
forward
his
arguments
somewhat
unconnectedly
not
seeking
to
change
the
general
view
which
prevailed
of
the
history
of
israel
for
this
reason
he
made
no
impression
on
the
majority
of
those
who
study
these
subjects
they
did
not
see
into
the
root
of
the
matter
they
could
still
regard
the
system
as
unshaken
and
the
numerous
attacks
on
details
of
it
as
unimportant
i
differ
from
graf
chiefly
in
this
that
i
always
go
back
to
the
centralisation
of
the
cultus
and
deduce
from
it
the
particular
divergences
my
whole
position
is
contained
in
my
first
chapter
there
i
have
placed
in
a
clear
light
that
which
is
of
such
importance
for
israelite
history
namely
the
part
taken
by
the
prophetical
party
in
the
great
metamorphosis
of
the
worship
which
by
no
means
came
about
of
itself
again
i
attach
much
more
weight
than
graf
did
to
the
change
of
ruling
ideas
which
runs
parallel
with
the
change
in
the
institutions
and
usages
of
worship
this
has
been
shown
mostly
in
the
second
part
of
the
present
work
almost
more
important
to
me
than
the
phenomena
themselves
are
the
presuppositions
which
lie
behind
them
not
everything
that
we
have
hitherto
discussed
proves
or
is
meant
to
prove
graf
hypothesis
on
the
other
hand
however
there
is
abundance
of
evidence
which
has
not
yet
been
noticed
to
discuss
it
all
in
detail
would
take
another
book
in
this
work
only
a
selection
can
be
with
all
brevity
indicated
if
the
limits
are
not
to
be
transgressed
which
are
imposed
by
the
essentially
historical
character
of
these
prolegomena
in
these
discussions
the
pro
will
as
a
rule
naturally
suggest
itself
in
the
refutation
of
the
contra
eberhard
schrader
mentions
in
his
introduction
to
the
old
testament
that
graf
assigns
the
legislation
of
the
middle
books
of
the
pentateuch
to
the
period
after
the
exile
but
he
does
not
give
the
least
idea
of
the
arguments
on
which
that
position
is
built
up
simply
dismissing
it
with
the
remark
that
even
critical
analysis
enters
its
veto
against
it
even
critical
analysis
how
does
it
manage
that
how
can
it
prove
that
the
one
and
sole
cultus
worked
out
on
every
side
to
a
great
system
the
denaturalising
of
the
sacrifices
and
festivals
the
distinction
between
the
priests
and
levites
and
the
autonomous
hierarchy
are
older
than
the
deuteronomic
reform
schrader
meaning
is
perhaps
that
while
the
signs
collected
by
a
comparison
of
the
sources
as
bearing
on
the
history
of
worship
show
the
order
of
succession
to
be
jehovist
deuteronomy
priestly
code
other
signs
of
a
more
formal
and
literary
nature
would
show
the
priestly
code
to
be
entitled
to
the
first
place
or
at
any
rate
not
the
last
and
that
the
latter
kind
of
evidence
is
of
as
much
force
as
the
former
were
this
so
the
scales
would
be
equally
balanced
and
the
question
would
not
admit
of
a
decision
but
this
awkward
situation
would
only
occur
if
the
arguments
of
a
literary
nature
to
be
urged
on
that
side
really
balanced
those
belonging
to
the
substance
of
the
case
which
plead
for
graf
hypothesis
in
discussing
the
composition
of
the
hexateuch
jahrb
deutsche
seq
seq
seq
i
have
shown
following
in
the
steps
of
other
scholars
that
this
is
by
no
means
the
case
and
for
the
sake
of
completeness
i
will
here
repeat
the
principal
points
of
that
discussion
it
is
asserted
that
the
historical
situation
of
deuteronomy
is
based
not
only
on
the
jehovistic
but
also
on
the
priestly
narrative
deuteronomy
proper
chaps
contains
scarcely
any
historical
matter
but
before
moses
comes
to
the
business
in
hand
we
have
two
introductions
chapter
and
chapter
to
explain
the
situation
in
which
he
promulgates
this
torah
shortly
before
his
death
we
are
in
the
amorite
kingdom
east
of
the
jordan
which
has
already
been
conquered
the
forty
years
wanderings
are
about
to
close
the
passage
to
the
land
of
canaan
for
which
this
legislation
is
intended
is
just
approaching
till
this
time
we
hear
in
chapter
the
only
law
was
that
which
is
binding
in
all
circumstances
and
was
therefore
promulgated
by
god
himself
from
horeb
the
law
of
the
ten
words
on
that
occasion
the
people
deprecated
any
further
direct
revelation
by
jehovah
and
commissioned
moses
to
be
their
representative
and
he
accordingly
betook
himself
to
the
sacred
mount
stayed
there
forty
days
and
forty
nights
and
received
the
two
tables
of
the
decalogue
and
besides
them
the
statutes
and
laws
which
now
forty
years
after
he
is
on
the
point
of
publishing
as
they
will
come
into
force
at
the
settlement
in
the
meantime
the
golden
calf
had
been
made
down
below
and
when
moses
descended
from
the
mount
in
his
anger
he
broke
the
tables
and
destroyed
the
idol
then
he
betook
himself
for
a
second
period
of
forty
days
and
nights
to
the
mount
pleaded
for
mercy
for
the
people
and
for
aaron
and
after
he
had
made
according
to
divine
command
two
new
tables
and
a
wooden
chest
for
them
jehovah
once
more
wrote
down
exactly
what
stood
on
the
tables
which
were
broken
on
this
occasion
it
is
remarked
in
x
the
levites
received
their
appointment
as
priests
this
is
evidently
a
reproduction
of
the
jehovistic
narrative
exodus
xix
xx
xxiv
the
priestly
code
on
the
contrary
is
entirely
ignored
deuteronomy
knows
only
two
laws
the
decalogue
which
the
people
received
and
the
statutes
and
judgments
which
moses
received
at
mount
horeb
they
were
both
given
at
the
same
time
one
directly
after
the
other
but
only
the
decalogue
had
till
now
been
made
public
where
is
the
whole
as
given
from
the
tabernacle
is
it
not
denying
the
very
notion
of
its
existence
that
moses
only
publishes
the
torah
at
the
passage
into
the
holy
land
because
it
has
application
and
force
for
that
land
and
not
for
the
wilderness
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
deuteronomist
according
to
chapter
knew
nothing
of
a
mosaic
central
sanctuary
can
he
have
read
what
we
now
read
between
exodus
xxiv
and
he
passes
over
all
that
is
there
inserted
from
the
priestly
code
noldeke
finds
it
is
true
jahrbb
fuer
prot
theologie
a
reminiscence
of
that
code
in
the
ark
of
acacia
wood
deuteronomy
x
but
the
ark
is
here
spoken
of
in
a
connection
which
answers
exactly
to
that
of
the
jehovist
exod
xxxii
xxxiii
and
is
quite
inconsistent
with
that
of
the
priestly
code
exodus
xxv
it
is
only
instituted
after
the
erection
of
the
golden
calf
not
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
divine
revelation
as
the
of
the
theocracy
true
the
ark
is
not
mentioned
in
je
exodus
as
we
now
have
it
but
in
the
next
jehovistic
piece
numbers
x
it
suddenly
appears
and
there
must
have
been
some
statement
in
the
work
as
to
how
it
came
there
the
tabernacle
also
appears
ready
set
up
in
xxxiii
without
any
foregoing
account
of
its
erection
the
institution
of
the
ark
as
well
as
the
erection
of
the
tabernacle
must
have
been
narrated
between
xxxiii
and
and
then
omitted
by
the
present
editor
of
the
pentateuch
from
the
necessity
of
paying
some
regard
to
q
exodus
xxv
that
this
is
the
case
many
other
considerations
also
tend
to
prove
without
the
ark
there
is
no
use
of
the
tabernacle
and
the
distinction
in
exodus
xxxiii
which
is
treated
as
one
of
importance
between
the
representation
of
jehovah
and
jehovah
himself
has
no
meaning
by
making
an
image
the
israelites
showed
that
they
could
not
do
without
a
sensible
representation
of
the
deity
and
jehovah
therefore
gave
them
the
ark
instead
of
the
calf
that
the
deuteronomist
found
je
in
a
more
complete
form
before
it
was
worked
up
with
q
than
that
in
which
we
have
it
after
the
working
up
is
not
such
a
difficult
assumption
that
one
should
be
driven
into
utter
impossibilities
in
order
to
avoid
it
for
according
to
noldeke
either
the
author
of
deuteronomy
had
before
him
the
pentateuch
as
it
now
is
and
was
enabled
very
curiously
to
sift
out
je
from
it
or
he
used
je
as
an
independent
work
but
read
q
as
well
only
in
such
a
way
that
his
general
view
was
in
no
way
influenced
by
that
of
the
priestly
work
but
on
the
contrary
contradicts
it
entirely
and
yet
unconsciously
since
his
work
leaves
no
opening
for
a
ritual
legislation
given
side
by
side
with
the
decalogue
and
that
ritual
legislation
is
the
whole
sum
and
substance
of
the
priestly
code
to
such
a
dilemma
are
we
to
make
up
our
minds
because
one
trait
or
another
of
the
deuteronomic
narrative
can
not
be
traced
in
je
as
we
now
have
it
and
is
preserved
in
q
does
this
amount
in
the
circumstances
to
a
proof
that
such
traits
were
derived
from
that
source
must
not
some
regard
in
fairness
be
paid
to
the
ensemble
of
the
question
we
may
further
remember
in
this
connection
vatke
remark
that
the
wooden
ark
in
deuteronomy
x
is
by
no
means
very
similar
to
that
of
exodus
which
to
judge
by
the
analogy
of
the
golden
table
and
altar
must
rather
have
been
called
a
golden
ark
it
takes
even
more
good
will
to
regard
the
statement
about
death
and
burial
in
mosera
and
the
induction
of
eleazar
in
his
place
deuteronomy
x
as
a
reminiscence
of
q
numbers
xx
seq
where
aaron
dies
and
is
buried
on
mount
hor
in
je
also
the
priests
aaron
and
eleazar
stand
by
the
side
of
moses
and
joshua
cf
joshua
xxiv
the
death
and
burial
of
aaron
are
certainly
no
longer
preserved
in
je
but
we
can
not
require
of
the
editor
of
the
pentateuch
that
he
should
make
a
man
die
twice
once
according
to
q
and
once
according
to
je
and
it
must
further
be
said
that
deuteronomy
x
is
an
interpolation
for
the
following
verses
x
in
which
not
only
aaron
and
eleazar
but
all
the
levites
are
in
possession
of
the
priesthood
are
the
continuation
of
x
and
rest
on
exodus
xxxii
here
we
are
still
in
horeb
not
in
mosera
the
historical
thread
which
runs
through
deuteronomy
ix
may
be
traced
further
in
chaps
after
their
departure
from
horeb
the
israelites
come
straight
to
kadesh
barnea
and
from
this
point
being
commanded
to
invade
the
of
judaea
they
first
send
twelve
spies
to
reconnoitre
the
country
guided
thereto
by
their
own
prudence
but
also
with
the
approval
of
moses
caleb
is
one
of
the
spies
but
not
joshua
after
penetrating
as
far
as
the
brook
eshcol
they
return
and
though
they
praise
the
goodness
of
the
land
yet
the
people
are
so
discouraged
by
their
report
that
they
murmur
and
do
not
venture
to
advance
jehovah
is
angry
at
this
and
orders
them
to
turn
back
to
the
wilderness
where
they
are
to
wander
up
and
down
till
the
old
generation
is
extinct
and
a
new
one
grown
up
seized
with
shame
they
advance
after
all
but
are
beaten
and
driven
back
now
they
retreat
to
the
wilderness
where
for
many
years
they
march
up
and
down
in
the
neighbourhood
of
mount
seir
till
at
length
years
after
the
departure
from
kadesh
they
are
commanded
to
advance
towards
the
north
but
to
spare
the
of
moab
and
ammon
they
conquer
the

of

takes
us
at
once
to

while
not
a
few
of
the
narratives
which
deuteronomy
repeats
or
alludes
to
occur
only
in

not
in

the
converse
does
not
occur
at

and
in

are
found
both
in

in

deuteronomy
follows
in
every
case
in
which
there
is
a
distinct
divergence
the
version
of

the

are
sent
out
from
kadesh
not
from
the
wilderness
of

they
only
reach
hebron

the

caleb

one
of
them
and

joshua
the
rebels
of

are

the

not
with

numbers
xxv
things
being
so
we
can
not
with
noldeke
see
in
the
number
of
the
spies
deuteronomy
i
an
unmistakable
sign
of
the
influence
of
q
numbers
xiii
had
the
author
read
the
narrative
as
it
is
now
before
us
in
numbers
xiii
it
would
be
impossible
to
understand
how
as
we
have
seen
the
jehovist
version
alone
made
any
impression
on
him
he
must
accordingly
have
known
q
as
a
separate
work
but
it
is
a
bold
step
to
argue
from
such
a
small
particular
to
the
use
of
a
source
which
everywhere
else
is
entirely
without
influence
and
unknown
especially
as
the
priority
of
this
source
is
by
no
means
established
on
independent
grounds
but
is
to
be
proved
by
this
alleged
use
of
it
lf
there
were
a
palpable
difference
between
je
and
q
in
this
point
if
we
could
say
that
in
q
there
were
twelve
spies
sent
out
and
in
je
three
the
case
would
be
different
but
in
numbers
xiii
the
beginning
of
the
narrative
of
je
has
been
removed
and
that
of
q
put
in
place
of
it
so
that
we
do
not
know
how
the
narrative
of
je
began
and
what
number
if
any
was
given
in
it
in
such
a
state
of
matters
the
only
reasonable
course
is
to
supply
what
is
lacking
in
je
from
deuteronomy
which
generally
follows
the
jehovist
alone
and
to
conclude
that
the
spies
were
twelve
in
number
in
this
source
also
the
instance
in
which
the
proof
would
be
strongest
that
deuteronomy
was
acquainted
with
the
narrative
of
the
priestly
code
is
x
for
the
seventy
souls
which
make
up
the
whole
of
israel
at
the
immigration
into
egypt
are
not
mentioned
in
je
and
there
is
no
gap
that
we
are
aware
of
in
the
jehovist
tradition
at
this
point
but
they
are
by
no
means
in
conflict
with
that
tradition
and
even
should
we
not
take
deuteronomy
x
for
a
proof
that
the
seventy
souls
found
a
place
in
it
also
yet
it
must
at
least
be
acknowledged
that
that
passage
is
by
no
means
sufficient
to
break
down
the
evidence
that
the
priestly
legislation
has
the
legislation
of
deuteronomy
for
its
noldeke
frequently
argues
from
such
numbers
as
and
as
if
they
only
occurred
in
q
but
that
is
not
the
case
as
q
in
the
beginning
of
genesis
has
groups
of
je
has
groups
of
and
occur
in
je
as
frequently
as
in
q
and
not
less
frequently
it
is
therefore
surprising
to
find
the
story
of
the
springs
of
water
and
the
of
elim
ascribed
to
q
for
no
other
reason
than
because
of
the
and
the
not
even
the
statements
of
the
age
of
the
patriarchs
except
so
far
as
they
serve
the
chronological
system
are
a
certain
mark
of
q
compare
genesis
xxxi
xxxvii
xli
deuteronomy
xxxiv
joshua
xxiv
only
the
names
of
the
spies
and
the
souls
are
incontestably
the
property
of
the
priestly
code
but
it
is
by
no
means
diflicult
to
show
especially
in
genesis
xlvi
that
they
are
far
less
original
than
the
figures
the
numbers
are
round
numbers
and
in
fact
do
not
admit
of
such
a
recital
of
the
items
of
which
they
are
made
up
as
a
further
objection
to
graf
hypothesis
the
deuteronomistic
revision
of
the
hexateuch
is
brought
into
the
field
that
revision
appears
most
clearly
it
is
said
in
those
parts
which
follow
the
deuteronomic
torah
and
point
back
to
it
it
used
to
be
taken
for
granted
that
it
extends
over
the
priestly
portions
as
well
as
the
jehovistic
but
since
the
occasion
arose
to
look
into
this
point
it
is
found
that
it
is
not
so
the
traces
which
noldeke
brings
together
on
the
point
are
trifling
and
besides
this
do
not
stand
the
test
he
says
that
the
deuteronomistic
account
of
the
death
of
moses
deuteronomy
xxxii
xxxiv
seq
can
not
be
regarded
as
anything
else
than
an
amplification
of
the
account
of
the
main
stem
q
which
is
preserved
almost
in
the
same
words
but
deuteronomy
xxxiv
contains
nothing
of
q
and
xxxii
has
not
undergone
deuteronomistic
revision
he
also
refers
to
josh
ix
joshua
made
the
gibeonites
at
that
day
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
for
the
congregation
and
for
the
altar
of
jehovah
even
unto
this
day
in
the
place
which
he
should
choose
the
second
part
of
this
sentence
he
says
is
a
deuteronomistic
addition
to
the
first
which
belongs
to
the
priestly
narrative
but
noldeke
himself
acknowledges
that
the
verses
ix
seq
are
not
the
continuation
of
the
priestly
version
but
of
the
jehovistic
version
and
between
verse
and
verse
there
is
nothing
wanting
but
the
circumstance
referred
to
in
verse
the
phrase
of
wood
and
drawer
of
is
not
enough
to
warrant
us
to
separate
verse
from
the
phrase
occurs
not
only
in
verse
but
also
in
je
verse
the
words
for
the
congregation
do
certainly
point
to
the
priestly
code
but
are
balanced
by
the
words
which
follow
for
the
altar
of
jehovah
which
is
according
to
the
jehovistic
view
the
original
statement
is
undoubtedly
that
the
gibeonites
are
assigned
to
the
altar
or
the
house
of
jehovah
but
according
to
ezekiel
xliv
the
hierodulic
services
in
the
temple
were
not
to
be
undertaken
by
foreigners
but
by
levites
hence
in
the
priestly
code
the
servants
of
the
altar
appear
as
servants
of
the
congregation
from
this
it
results
that
lmzbx
is
to
be
preferred
in
verse
to
l
dh
w
the
latter
being
a
later
correction
as
such
it
affords
a
proof
that
the
last
revision
of
the
hexateuch
proceeded
from
the
priestly
code
and
not
from
deuteronomy
as
for
joshua

where
noldeke
sees
in
the
account
of
the
division
of
the
land
another
instance
of
deuteronomistic
addition
i
have
already
indicated
my
opinion
the
piece
is
jehovistic
and
if
the
view
were
to
be
found
in
the
priestly
code
at
all
that
joshua
first
allotted
their
territory
to
judah
and
ephraim
and
then
a
good
while
after
to
the
other
seven
tribes
that
source
must
have
derived
such
a
view
from
je
where
alone
it
has
its
roots

and

considers
josh

quite
decidedly
for
his
view
but
in
the
narrative
of
the
priestly
code

to
which
the

do
not
belong
there
is
no
sign
of
deuteronomistic
revision
to
be
found
joh

there
is
a
more
serious
difficulty
only
in
the
case
of
the

the
kernel

these
awkward

this
may
seem
to
be
pure

it
is
reinforced
by
the
confirmation
of
the
septuagint
which
did
not
find
any

this
is
undoubtedly
and

the
fact
and
this
must
dispose
us
a
priori
to
attach
less
weight
to
isolated
instances
to
the
contrary
the
more
so
as

shows
that

such
a
revision
must
be
assumed
to
have
taken
place
if
the
priestly
code
is
younger
than
deuteronomy
but
the
assumption
of
its
existence
does
not
depend

deduction

the

the
reviser
of

his
hand

not

with

are
always

precept
thou

not
respect

xix
is
a
development
of
that
in

xxiii
and
a
number
of
other
precepts
in
leviticus
xix
could
stand
with
equal
appropriateness
in
exodus

the
directions
in
leviticus
xxii
are
similar
to
those
of

in
the

way
those

are
repeated
in

we
have
the
jehovistic
phrase
a

flowing
with
milk

yet
leviticus
only
takes
its
from
the
jehovistic
legislation
and
modifies
it
very
considerably
somewhat
in
the
manner
of
deuteronomy
there
is
a
demonstrable
affinity
with
deuteronomy
both
in
the
ideas
and
in
the
expressions
common
to
both
is
the
care
for
the
poor
and
the
undefended

both

a
main
object

shall
not

shall
be
unto

shalt
love

thyself

attaches
great
importance
to
unity

worship
it
is
still
a
demand

a
presupposition
xvii

the
motive
of
it
is
to
guard
against
heathen
influences
and
to
secure
the
establishment
of
a
monotheism
without
images
xvii
cf
xi
xviii
xix
xx

with
regard
to
the
date
we
have
to
note
the
stern
prohibition
of
the
service
of
moloch
on
lev
xvii
see
above
this
is
quite
recognisable
and
forms
an
important
point
of
contact
with
deuteronomy
the
same
contact
may
be
observed
in
the
prohibition
of
certain
observances
of
mourning
xix
seq
the
calculation
of
pentecost
from
the
beginning
of
barley
harvest
xxiii
the
seven
days
duration
of
the
feast
of
tabernacles
and
the
cheerful
sacrificial
feasts
which
are
to
accompany
its
observance
add
to
this
a
similarity
by
no
means
slight
in
the
colour
of
the
language
in
xviii
xix
xx
xxv
seq
some
of
the
phrases
may
be
mentioned
when
ye
are
come
into
the
land
that
i
shall
give
you
ye
shall
rejoice
before
jehovah
i
am
jehovah
that
brought
you
up
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
ye
shall
keep
my
commandments
and
statutes
and
laws
to
do
them
but
the
legislation
we
have
here
is
further
advanced
than
deuteronomy
in
the
festivals
the
joint
sacrifice
of
the
congregation
is
already
prominent
xxiii
the
priests
are
not
the
levites
but
the
sons
and
brothers
of
aaron
their
income
has
grown
materially
their
separate
holiness
has
reached
a
higher
point
stricter
demands
are
also
made
on
the
laity
for
personal
holiness
especially
as
regards
continence
from
the
sins
of
the
flesh
and
the
marriage
of
relatives
leviticus
xviii
marriage
with
an
uncle
wife
is
forbidden
xviii
xx
whereas
in
deuteronomy
it
is
still
legal
the
work
dates
from
a
time
when
exile
was
a
familiar
idea
xviii
seq
ye
shall
keep
my
statutes
and
my
judgments
and
shall
not
commit
any
of
those
abominations
for
the
men
that
were
in
the
land
before
you
did
these
things
and
the
land
vomited
them
out
take
care
that
the
land
spue
not
you
out
also
as
it
spued
out
the
nations
that
were
before
you
similarly
xx
seq
and
in
a
legislative
work
such
utterances
prove
more
than
they
would
in
a
prophecy
now
as
our
section
departs
from
deuteronomy
it
approaches
to
ezekiel
this
is
its
closest
relationship
and
that
to
which
attention
has
been
most
drawn
it
appears
in
the
peculiar
fusion
of
cultus
and
morality
in
the
notion
of
holiness
in
a
somewhat
materialistic
sense
as
the
great
requirement
of
religion
and
in
the
fact
that
the
demand
of
holiness
is
made
to
rest
on
the
residence
of
the
people
near
the
sanctuary
and
in
the
holy
land
on
leviticus
xxii
compare
kuenen
hibbert
lectures
but
the
affinity
is
still
more
striking
in
the
language
many
unusual
phrases
and
even
whole
sentences
from
ezekiel
are
repeated
in
leviticus
xvii
seq
compare
colenso
pentateuch
and
joshua
vi
kayser
op
cit
smend
on
ezekiel
xxv
the
of
the
month
is
in
leviticus
xxv
as
in
ezekiel
day
not
as
in
the
priestly
code
the
great
day
of
atonement
this
led
graf
to
regard
ezekiel
himself
as
the
author
of
this
collection
of
laws
in
leviticus
and
colenso
and
kayser
followed
him
but
this
is
out
of
the
question
notwithstanding
the
numerous
points
of
contact
both
in
linguistic
and
material
respects
the
agreement
is
by
no
means
complete
ezekiel
knows
no
seed
of
aaron
and
no
wine
at
the
sacrifices
leviticus
xxiii
his
festival
legislation
shows
considerable
differences
and
in
spirit
is
more
akin
to
the
priestly
code
and
if
he
were
the
author
he
would
have
said
something
about
the
proper
place
in
the
cultus
of
the
levites
and
of
the
prince
the
corpus
in
question
which
klostermann
called
not
inappropriately
the
law
of
holiness
inclines
from
ezekiel
towards
the
priestly
code
in
such
pieces
as
xvii
xxi
xxii
it
takes
some
closeness
of
attention
to
see
the
differences
from
the
latter
though
in
fact
they
are
not
inconsiderable
it
stands
between
the
two
somewhat
nearer
no
doubt
to
ezekiel
how
are
we
to
regard
this
fact
jehovist
deuteronomy
ezekiel
are
a
historical
series
ezekiel
law
of
holiness
priestly
code
must
also
be
taken
as
historical
steps
and
this
in
such
a
way
as
to
explain
at
the
same
time
the
dependence
of
the
law
of
holiness
on
the
jehovist
and
on
deuteronomy
to
assume
that
ezekiel
having
the
pentateuch
in
all
other
respects
as
we
have
it
had
a
great
liking
for
this
piece
of
it
and
made
it
his
model
in
the
foundation
of
his
style
of
thought
and
expression
such
an
assumption
does
not
free
us
from
the
necessity
of
seeking
the
historical
order
and
of
assigning
his
natural
place
in
that
order
to
ezekiel
we
can
not
argue
on
such
a
mere
chance
now
the
question
is
not
a
complicated
one
whether
in
the
law
of
holiness
we
are
passing
from
the
priestly
code
to
ezekiel
or
from
ezekiel
to
the
priestly
code
the
law
of
holiness
underwent
a
last
revision
which
represents
not
the
views
of
ezekiel
but
those
of
the
priestly
code
and
by
means
of
which
it
is
incorporated
in
that
code
this
revision
has
not
been
equally
incisive
in
all
parts
some
of
its
corrections
and
supplements
are
very
considerable
xxiii

some
of
them
are
quite
unimportant

the
xix

the
kodesh
kodashim
xxi
only
in

is
the
elimination
of
the
additions
difficult
but
the
fact
that
the
last
edition
of
the
law
of
holiness
proceeds
from
the
priestly
code
is
universally
acknowledged
its
importance
for
the
literary
history
of
israel
can
not
be
horst
in
his
discussion
on
leviticus
xvii
and
ezekiel
colmar
has
strikingly
shown
that
the
mechanical
style
of
criticism
in
which
dillmann
even
surpasses
his
predecessor
knobel
is
not
equal
to
the
problem
presented
by
the
law
of
holiness
he
goes
on
however
to
an
attempt
to
save
by
modifying
it
the
old
strassburg
view
of
ezekiel
authorship
and
as
kuenen
justly
remarks
he
makes
on
leviticus

the
concluding
oration
leviticus
xxvi
calls
for
special
consideration
earlier
scholars
silently
assumed
that
this
piece
belonged
to
leviticus
xvii
but
many
critics
noldeke
for
example
now
regard
it
as
an
interpolation
in
leviticus
of
a
piece
which
from
its
character
should
be
elsewhere
at
any
rate
the
oration
is
composed
with
special
reference
to
what
precedes
it
if
it
is
not
taken
as
a
peroration
such
as
exodus
xxiii
deuteronomy
its
position
in
such
a
part
of
the
priestly
code
is
quite
incomprehensible
it
has
moreover
a
palpable
connection
with
the
laws
in
the
and
have
here
the
same
significance
for
religion
as
in
chaps
xix
xxiii
xxv
the
threat
of
vomiting
out

is
repeated
here
more
circumstantially
the
only
statute
actually
named
is
that
of
the
fallow

the
seventh

the
piece
begins
with
the
expression
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
author
of
chapter
xvii
seq
if
ye
walk
in
my
statutes
and
keep
my
commandments
and
do
them
and
the
same
phrase
recurs
with
slight
alteration
in
vers
and
the
conclusion
verse
is
these
are
the
statutes
and
judgments
and
laws
which
jehovah
gave
to
regulate
the
relation
between
him
and
israel
on
mount
sinai
by
moses
this
is
obviously
the
subscription
of
a
preceding
corpus
of
statutes
and
judgments
such
as
we
have
in
xvii
mount
sinai
is
mentioned
also
in
xxv
as
the
place
of
revelation
if
leviticus
xxvi
is
incontestably
intended
to
form
the
conclusion
of
chaps
it
would
be
natural
to
suppose
that
the
author
of
that
collection
was
also
the
author
of
the
oration
noldeke
thinks
however
that
the
language
differs
too
much
from
that
of
yet
he
is
obliged
to
acknowledge
several
resemblances
and
these
not
unimportant
while
some
of
the
differences
which
he
adduces
bamoth
gillulim
hammanim
xxvi
are
really
examples
of
similarity
rare
and
original
words
may
be
found
in
the
preceding
chapters
also
it
may
be
that
in
chapter
xxvi
they
are
more
frequent
in
proportion
yet
this
does
not
entitle
us
to
say
that
the
language
generally
is
very
original
on
the
contrary
it
is
everywhere
characterised
by
borrowed
expressions
so
much
of
linguistic
difference
as
actually
remains
is
sufficiently
accounted
for
by
the
difference
of
subject
first
come
laws
in
a
dry
style
then
prophecy
in
a
poetical
pathetic
style
the
idiosyncrasy
of
the
writer
has
no
scope
in
the
former
case
from
the
nature
of
the
materials
some
of
which
had
already
assumed
their
form
before
he
made
use
of
them
in
the
latter
case
he
can
express
himself
freely
and
it
is
fair
that
this
should
not
be
overlooked
the
arguments
brought
forward
by
noldeke
against
the
probability
that
leviticus
xxvi
belongs
to
chaps
and
is
not
merely
tacked
on
to
them
disappear
completely
on
a
closer
comparison
of
the
literary
character
of
the
two
pieces
chapter
xxvi
reminds
us
most
strongly
of
ezekiel
style
both
in
thought
and
language
the
most
significant
passage
is
leviticus
xxvi
the
threat
has
been
uttered
that
israel
is
to
be
destroyed
as
a
people
and
that
the
remnant
which
escapes
the
destroying
sword
of
the
enemy
is
to
be
carried
into
exile
to
sink
under
the
weight
of
past
calamity
and
present
affliction
then
the
speech
goes
on
and
they
that
are
left
of
you
shall
in
their
iniquity
in
your
enemies
land
and
also
in
the
iniquities
of
their
fathers
shall
they
then
they
will
confess
their
own
sin
and
the
sin
of
their
fathers
in
ezekiel
this
confession
actually
occurs
in
the
mouth
of
one
of
his
they
say
xxxiii
our
transgressions
and
our
sins
are
heavy
upon
us
and
we
in
them
and
can
not
live
in
the
same
strain
the
prophet
says
xxiv
that
in
his
dull
sorrow
for
the
death
of
his
wife
he
will
be
an
emblem
of
the
people
ye
shall
not
mourn
nor
weep
but
ye
shall
in
your
iniquities
nor
are
the
other
traits
wanting
in
the
oration
which
as
we
say
accompanied
the
ezekielic
colouring
of
the
preceding
chapters
we
do
not
expect
to
find
traces
of
the
influence
of
the
jehovist
legislation
further
than
that
exodus
xxiii
seq
formed
the
model
both
for
deuteronomy
xxviii
and
leviticus
xxvi
but
to
make
up
for
this
we
find
very
distinct
marks
of
the
influence
of
the
prophets
the
older
prophets
too
as
amos
verse
we
can
as
little
conceive
the
existence
of
the
book
of
ezekiel
as
of
this
chapter
without
the
prophetic
literature
having
preceded
it
and
laid
the
foundation
for
it
as
for
the
relation
to
deuteronomy
the
resemblance
of
leviticus
xxvi
to
deuteronomy
xxviii
is
very
great
in
the
arrangement
as
well
as
in
the
ideas
true
there
are
not
many
verbal
coincidences
but
the
few
which
do
occur
are
important
the
expressions
of
xxvi
occur
nowhere
in
the
old
testament
but
in
deuteronomy
xxviii
similarly
r
ym
with
the
meaning
it
has
in
verse
only
occurs
in
deuteronomy
xix
and
in
the
later
literature
isaiah
lxi
the
metaphor
of
the
uncircumcised
heart
verse
only
occurs
in
one
other
passage
in
the
law
in
deuteronomy
the
other
instances
of
it
are
in
prophecy
of
contemporary
or
later
date
jeremiah
iv
ix
ezekiel
xliv
there
are
several
more
reminiscences
of
jeremiah
most
of
them
however
not
very
distinct
we
may
remark
on
the
relation
between
jeremiah
xvi
in
one
respect
to
verse
and
in
another
to
verse
of
our
chapter
here
the
sin
is
punished
sevenfold
in
jeremiah
double
the
same
is
said
in
isaiah
xl
lx
and
our
chapter
has
also
in
common
with
this
prophet
the
remarkable
use
of
rtc
h
with
sin
or
trespass
as
object
did
not
the
chapter
stand
in
leviticus
it
would
doubtless
be
held
to
be
a
reproduction
some
small
part
of
it
of
the
older
prophecies
the
most
of
it
of
those
of
jeremiah
and
ezekiel
leviticus
xxvi
is
actually
quoted
in
xxxvi
as
a
word
of
the
prophet
jeremiah
leviticus
xxvi
has
points
of
contact
finally
with
the
priestly
code
in
prh
wrbh
hqym
bryt
htwdh
ny
never
nky
in
the
excessive
use
of
the
accusative
participle
and
avoidance
of
verbal
suffixes
and
in
its
preferring
the
colourless
ntn
to
verbs
of
more
special
meaning
the
only
reason
for
the
attempt
to
separate
leviticus
xxvi
from
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
exilic
or
origin
of
this
hortatory
and
denunciatory
oration
is
too
plain
to
be
mistaken
to
us
this
circumstance
can
only
prove
that
it
belongs
to
providing
a
weighty
confirmation
of
the
opinion
we
have
already
formed
on
other
grounds
as
to
the
period
which
produced
these
laws
if
ye
will
not
for
all
this
hearken
unto
me
but
walk
contrary
to
me
then
i
will
also
walk
contrary
to
you
in
fury
and
i
will
chastise
you
seven
times
for
your
sins
ye
shall
eat
the
flesh
of
your
sons
and
daughters
and
i
will
destroy
your
high
places
and
cast
down
your
and
cast
your
carcasses
upon
the
carcasses
of
your
idols
and
my
soul
shall
abhor
you
and
i
will
make
your
cities
waste
and
bring
your
sanctuaries
into
desolation
and
i
will
not
smell
the
savour
of
your
sweet
odours
and
i
will
bring
the
land
into
desolation
and
your
enemies
who
settle
therein
shall
be
astonished
at
it
and
i
will
scatter
you
among
the
peoples
and
will
draw
out
the
sword
after
you
and
your
land
shall
be
desolate
and
your
cities
ruins
then
shall
the
land
pay
her
sabbaths
all
the
years
of
the
desolation
when
you
are
in
your
enemies
land
even
then
shall
the
land
rest
and
pay
her
sabbaths
as
long
as
it
lieth
desolate
it
shall
make
up
the
celebration

will
send
a
faintness
into
their

and
the
sound

leaf
shall
chase
them
and
they

flee
as
fleeing
from
a

and
they
shall
fall
when
none

they
shall
fall
one
upon

it

there
shall
be
no
stopping
in

ye
shall
lose
yourselves

the

shall
eat

they
that

shall
pine
away
in
their
iniquity
in
your
enemies
lands
and
also
in
the
iniquities
of
their
fathers
shall
they
pine
away
and
they
shall
confess
their
iniquity
and
the
iniquity
of
their
fathers
in
regard
to
their
unfaithfulness
which
they
committed
against
me
and
that
because
they
have
walked
contrary
to
me
i
also
walk
contrary
to
them
and
bring
them
into
the
land
of
their
enemies
then
their
uncircumcised
heart
is
humbled
and
then
they
pay
their
penalty
and
i
remember
my
covenant
with
jacob
and
also
my
covenant
with
isaac
and
also
my
covenant
with
abraham
and
i
remember
the
land
the
land
also
left
by
them
pays
its
sabbaths
while
she
lieth
without
inhabitant
and
waste
and
they
themselves
pay
the
penalty
of
their
iniquity
because
even
because
they
despised
my
judgments
and
their
soul
abhorred
my
statutes
and
yet
for
all
that
when
they
be
in
the
land
of
their
enemies
i
have
not
rejected
them
neither
have
i
abhorred
them
to
destroy
them
utterly
and
to
break
my
covenant
with
them
for
i
am
jehovah
their
god
and
i
will
for
their
sakes
remember
the
covenant
of
their
ancestors
whom
i
brought
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
in
the
sight
of
the
peoples
that
i
might
be
their

xxvi
these
words
undoubtedly
can
not
have
been
written
before
the
babylonian
exile
it
is
said
that
the
assyrian
exile
will
explain
the
passage
but
where
is
there
any
similarity
between
the
oration
before
us
and
the
old
genuine
isaiah
in
ezekiel
day
such
thoughts
feelings
and
expressions
as
we
have
here
can
be
shown
to
have
prevailed
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
show
that
the
fall
of
samaria
gave
rise
to
such
depression
at
jerusalem
and
leviticus
xxvi
was
not
written
outside
jerusalem
for
it
presupposes
unity
of
worship
the
are
addressed
here
as
in
deuteronomy
and
they
had
no
such
lively
feeling
of
solidarity
with
the
deported
israelites
as
to
think
of
them
in
connection
with
such
threats
i
even
think
it
certain
that
the
writer
lived
either
towards
the
end
of
the
babylonian
exile
or
after
it
since
at
the
close
of
the
oration
he
turns
his
eyes
to
the
restoration
in
such
prophets
as
jeremiah
and
ezekiel
there
is
a
meaning
in
such
forecasting
of
the
joyful
future
but
here
it
contradicts
both
the
historical
position
and
the
object
of
the
threats
and
appears
to
be
explained
most
naturally
as
the
result
of
an
accident
of
actuality
that
in
a
comparison
of
leviticus
xxvi
with
jeremiah
and
ezekiel
the
former
can
not
claim
priority
appears
distinctly
from
the
comparative
use
of
the
phrase
that
phrase
originates
in
jeremiah
iv
ix
seq
but
in
leviticus
xxvi
it
is
used
as
a
set
term
in
the
same
way
the
phrase
away
in
their
is
repeated
by
ezekiel
as
he
heard
it
in
the
mouth
of
the
people
he
is
its
originator
in
literature
in
leviticus
xxvi
it
is
borrowed
horst

to
find
a
place
for
leviticus

in
the

of

zedekiah

but
in
this
he
is
merely
working
out
his
theory
that
the
author
was
the
youthful
ezekiel
and
the
theory
is
sufficiently
condemned
if
it
leads
to
this
consequence
delitzsch

it
a
piece
of
impertinence
in

to
read
out

ieads
us
to
the
result
that
a
collection
of
laws
which
took
form
during
the
period
of
the
exile
was
received
into
the
priestly
code
and
there
clothed
with
fresh
life
we
need
not
then
tremble
at
schrader
threatening
us
with
critical
analysis
and

hypothesis

not

two
or

further
important
traces
of
the
final
priestly
revision
of
the
hexateuch
may
here
find
mention
in
the
story
of
the
flood
the
verses
vii
are
an
editorial
addition
with
the
object
of
removing
a
contradiction
between
je
and
q
it
shares
the
ideas
and
speaks
the
language
of
the
priestly
code
in
the
title
of
deuteronomy
the
verse
it
came
to
pass
in
the
fortieth
year
in
the
eleventh
ty
month
on
the
first
day
of
the
month
that
moses
spake
unto
the
children
of
israel
according
to
all
that
jehovah
had
given
him
in
commandment
unto
them
i
is
shown
by
the
most
undoubted
signs
to
belong
to
the
priestly
code
and
is
intended
to
incorporate
deuteronomy
in
that
work
we
have
already
shown
that
the
priestly
code
in
the
book
of
joshua
is
simply
a
of
the
narrative
that
the
priestly
code
consists
of
elements
of
two
kinds
first
of
an
independent
stem
the
book
of
the
four
covenants
q
and
second
of
innumerable
additions
and
supplements
which
attach
themselves
principally
to
the
book
of
the
four
covenants
but
not
to
it
alone
and
indeed
to
the
whole
of
the
hexateuch
this
assertion
has
not
strange
to
say
met
with
the
opposition
which
might
have
been
expected
ryssel
has
even
seen
in
the
twofold
nature
of
the
priestly
code
a
means
to
maintain
the
position
of
the
book
of
the
four
covenants
before
the
exile
he
sacrifices
the
additions
and
places
the
necessary
interval
between
them
and
the
main
body
of
the
work
he
thinks
the
close
affinity
between
the
two
parts
is
sufficiently
explained
by
the
supposition
that
they
both
issued
from
the
same
circle
that
of
the
priesthood
of
jerusalem
were
it
the
case
that
the
temple
of
jerusalem
was
as
autonomous
and
as
solely
legitimate
in
the
days
of
solomon
as
in
those
of
the
foreign
domination
that
the
priests
had
as
much
to
say
under
ahaz
hezekiah
and
josiah
as
after
the
exile
if
it
were
allowable
to
represent
them
according
as
it
suits
one
views
and
not
according
to
the
historical
evidence
if
in
short
there
were
no
israelite
history
at
all
such
an
explanation
might
be
allowed
to
stand
the
secondary
part
of
the
priestly
code
of
necessity
draws
the
primary
part
with
it
the
similarity
in
matter
and
in
form
the
perfect
agreement
in
tendencies
and
ideas
in
expressions
and
ways
of
putting
things
all
compel
us
to
think
that
the
whole
if
not
a
literary
is
yet
a
historical
unity
it
has
lately
been
the
fashion
to
regard
the
language
of
the
priestly
code
as
an
insuperable
barrier
to
the
destructive
efforts
of
tendency
criticism
but
it
is
unfortunate
that
this
veto
of
language
is
left
as
destitute
of
detailed
proof
by
delitzsch
riehm
and
dillmann
as
the
veto
of
critical
analysis
by
schrader
and
we
can
not
be
called
upon
to
show
proof
against
a
contention
which
is
unsupported
by
evidence
but
i
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
communicate
some
detached
observations
which
i
may
perhaps
remark
did
not
occur
to
me
in
connection
with
the
investigation
of
the
pentateuch
but
on
a
quite
different
occasion
in
the
passage
vi
i
was
exceedingly
struck
with
l
mt
and
not
less
with
br
in
the
two
passages
isaiah
iv
amos
iv
and
while
following
out
the
distribution
of
these
two
words
i
came
on
the
traces
of
similar
phenomena
the
language
of
the
historical
books
is
in
general
much
akin
to
that
of
the
jehovistic
work
that
of
the
priestly
code
on
the
contrary
is
quite
different
it
is
common
enough
to
interpret
this
fact
as
if
the
latter
belonged
to
an
earlier
period
but
not
to
mention
that
in
that
case
the
code
must
have
been
entirely
without
influence
on
the
history
of
the
language
it
agrees
ill
with
this
view
that
on
going
back
to
the
oldest
documents
preserved
to
us
of
the
historical
literature
of
the
hebrews
we
find
the
difference
increasing
rather
than
diminishing
take
judges
and
the
poetical
pieces
in
je
may
be
compared
with
them
but
in
q
there
is
nothing
like
them
and
on
the
other
hand
it
is
in
the
narratives
which
were
introduced
very
late
into
the
history
such
as
judges
vii
viii
x
seq
xii
and
the
apocryphal
additions
in
that
we
recognise
most
readily
some
linguistic
approximation
to
the
priestly
code
and
as
in
the
historical
so
also
in
the
prophetical
literature
the
speech
of
amos
isaiah
micah
answers
on
the
whole
to
that
of
the
jehovist
not
to
that
of
the
priestly
author
deuteronomy
and
the
book
of
jeremiah
first
agree
with
the
priestly
code
in
certain
important
expressions
in
ezekiel
such
expressions
are
much
more
numerous
and
the
agreement
is
by
no
means
with
leviticus
alone
i
especially
noticeable
is
p
t
ngb
tymnh
in
ezekiel
and
the
priestly
code
in
the
latter
negeb
even
when
it
refers
to
the
actual
negeb
yet
is
used
as
denoting
south
numbers
xxxiv
xxv
it
has
completely
lost
its
original
meaning
in
the
subsequent
prophets
down
to
malachi
the
points
of
contact
are
limited
to
details
but
do
not
cease
to
occur
they
occur
also
in
the
psalms
and
in
ecclesiastes
reminiscences
of
the
priestly
code
are
found
nowhere
but
in
the
chronicles
and
some
of
the
psalms
for
that
amos
iv
is
borrowed
from
genesis
xix
is
not
a
whit
more
clear
than
that
the
original
of
amos
i
must
be
sought
in
joel
iv
iii
the
priestly
code
maintains
its
isolated
literary
character
as
against
the
later
literature
also
this
is
the
result
partly
of
the
use
of
a
number
of
technical
terms
partly
of
the
incessant
repetition
of
the
same
formulae
and
of
its
great
poverty
of
language
but
if
we
neglect
what
is
due
to
the
stiff
and
hard
idiosyncrasy
of
the
author
it
is
undoubtedly
the
case
that
he
makes
use
of
a
whole
series
of
characteristic
expressions
which
are
not
found
before
the
exile
but
gradually
emerge
and
come
into
use
after
it
the
fact
is
not
even
denied
it
is
merely
put
aside
to
show
what
weight
is
due
to
it
we
may
find
room
here
for
a
short
statement
of
the
interesting
points
for
the
history
of
language
to
be
found
in
genesis
genesis

r
yt
means
in
the
older
hebrew
not
the
commencement
of
a
process
which
goes
forward
in
time
but
the
first
and
generally
the
best
part
of
a
thing
in
the
sense
of
a
beginning
in
time
as
the
contrary
to

is
first
found
in

are

on

to
come
down

always
the

tw

so
in

generally
in

main
work
in

these
substitutes
with
t
are
only
used
sometimes
and
for
special
reasons
it
may
be
generally
asserted
that
they
are
more
used
the
later
we
come
down
parallel
with
this
is
the
use
of
nky
in
j
and
ny
in
the
priestly
code
the
latter
form
grows
always
more
frequent
in
later
times
these
remarks
carry
us
beyond
genesis
for
the
priestly
code
generally
i
am
now
able
to
refer
to
giesebrecht
essay
on
the
criticism
of
the
hexateuch
such
words
as
qrbn
cm
l
mt
ty
are
each
by
itself
strong
arguments
for
assuming
a
late
date
for
the
production
of
the
priestly
code
we
can
not
believe
that
such
everyday
words
should
never
have
come
into
use
in
the
other
literature
before
the
exile
if
they
were
in
existence
they
can
not
be
counted
technical
terms
qrbn
used
in
hebrew
for
sacrifice
and
offering
is
simply
as
if
an
english
writer
should
say
priere
instead
of
worship
in
such
comparisons
of
the
vocabulary
we
have
however
to
consider
first
the
working
up
and
revision
which
has
been
at
work
in
every
part
of
the
books
of
the
bible
and
secondly
the
caprice
of
the
writers
in
apparent
trifles
such
as
nky
and
ny
especially
outside
the
pentateuch
these
two
agencies
have
so
dislocated
the
original
facts
in
this
matter
that
in
general
we
can
only
deal
in
proportions
and
must
be
content
with
showing
that
a
word
occurs
say
times
in
the
other
literature
and
times
in
an
equal
extent
of
the
later
too
much
importance
must
not
be
attached
to
aramaisms
even
when
they
admit
of
clear
demonstration
they
prove
little
while
occurring
merely
in
single
instances
we
early
find
remarkable
phenomena
such
as
ndr
for
nzr
hence
nzyr
vovens
for
ncr
amos
i
for
comp
arabic
for
sur
hudh
and
yet
such
an
aramaism
as
bt
nth
in
numbers
xv
or
even
qrbn
is
very
remarkable
the
study
of
the
history
of
language
is
still
at
a
very
elementary
stage
in
hebrew
in
that
which
pertains
to
the
lexicographer
it
would
do
well
to
include
in
its
scope
the
proper
names
of
the
old
testament
when
it
would
probably
appear
that
not
only
parnach
numbers
xxxiv
but
also
composite
names
such
as
point
less
to
the
mosaic
than
to
the
persian
period
and
have
their
analogies
in
the
chronicles
on
the
other
hand
the
prepositions
and
particles
would
have
to
be
examined
the
use
of
the
prepositions
beth
and
lamed
in
the
priestly
code
is
very
peculiar
that
would
lead
further
to
syntax
or
better
still
to
rhetoric
and
style
a
diffcult
and
little
cultivated
field
of
study
but
one
of
great
importance
and
lending
itself
readily
to
comparative
treatment
this
treatment
yields
the
most
results
in
the
case
of
those
parallels
which
have
an
undoubted
and
direct
relation
to
each
other
the
dependence
of
the
priestly
code
on
the
jehovist
can
not
be
more
strikingly
demonstrated
than
by
comparing
its
cdyq
genesis
vi
with
the
cdyq
bdwr
hzh
of
genesis
vii
the
plural
drwt
is
quite
on
a
line
with
the

of
the

and
the
spermata
of
galatians
iii
it
does
not
denote
the
successive
generations
but
contemporaries
the
contemporaneous
individuals
of
one
and
the
same
generation
from
words
we
are
brought
back
to
things
again
by
noting
that
the
age
of
the
word
depends
in
many
cases
on
the
introduction
of
the
thing
the
name
btr
in
the
song
of
songs
for
example
presupposes
the
cultivation
of
the
malobathron
in
syria
and
palestine
the
priestly
code
enumerates
colours
stuffs
goldsmiths
work
and
jewels
which
nowhere
occur
in
the
older
literature
along
with
the
book
of
ezekiel
it
is
the
principal
quarry
in
the
old
testament
for
the
history
of
art
and
this
is
the
less
likely
to
be
due
to
chance
as
the
geographical
horizon
of
the
two
works
is
also
the
same
there
is
also
some
contact
in
this
respect
though
to
a
less
degree
between
the
priestly
code
and
isaiah
and
this
must
doubtless
receive
a
historical
explanation
in
the
circumstances
of
the
babylonian
age
on
canticles
cf
schuerer
theol
lit
it
also
by
the
names
of
plants
and
similar
details
mentioned
in
it
is
an
important
source
for
the
history
of
external
civilisation
in

with
the
septuagint
npk
instead
of
the
meaningless

and

instead
of
bnyk
chapter
x
the
oral
and
the
written
torah
what
importance
the
written
letter
the
book
of
the
law
possessed
for
the
jews
we
all
know
from
the
new
testament
of
ancient
israel
again
it
is
said
in
the
introductory
poem
of
divan
that
the
word
was
so
important
there
because
it
was
a
spoken
word
the
contrast
which
goethe
evidently
perceived
is
really
characteristic
and
deserves
some
further
attention
even
if
it
be
the
case
that
deuteronomy
and
the
priestly
code
were
only
reduced
to
writing
at
a
late
period
still
there
remains
the
jehovistic
legislation
exodus
xxxiv
which
might
be
regarded
as
the
document
which
formed
the
of
the
religious
history
of
israel
and
this
position
is
in
fact
generally
claimed
for
it
yet
not
for
the
whole
of
it
since
it
is
commonly
recognised
that
the
sinaitic
book
of
the
covenant
exodus
was
given
to
a
people
who
were
settled
and
thoroughly
accustomed
to
agriculture
and
who
moreover
had
passed
somewhat
beyond
the
earliest
stage
in
the
use
of
money
exodus
xxi
compare
xxi
with
judges
ix
the
decalogue
alone
is
commonly
maintained
to
be
in
the
strictest
sense
mosaic
this
is
principally
on
account
of
the
statement
that
it
was
written
down
on
the
two
stone
tables
of
the
sacred
ark
yet
of
deuteronomy
also
we
read
both
that
it
was
written
on
twelve
stones
and
that
it
was
deposited
in
the
sacred
ark
deuteronomy
xxxi
we
can
not
therefore
place
implicit
reliance
on
such
statements
what
is
attested
in
this
way
of
the
decalogue
seems
to
find
confirmation
in
viii
but
the
authority
of
this
statement
is
greatly
weakened
by
the
fact
that
it
occurs
in
a
passage
which
has
undergone
the
deuteronomistic
revision
and
has
been
in
addition
to
this
subjected
to
interpolation
the
more
weight
must
we
therefore
allow
to
the
circumstance
which
makes
for
a
different
conclusion
that
the
name
the
ark
of
the
covenant
the
box
of
the
law
is
peculiar
to
the
later
writers
compare
viii
the
ark
wherein
is
the
covenant
of
jehovah
and
viii
there
was
nothing
in
the
ark
save
the
two
tables
of
stone
which
moses
put
there
at
horeb
the
tables
of
the
covenant
which
jehovah
had
made
with
the
children
of
israel
the
deuteronomistic
expression
tables
of
the
covenant
alternates
in
the
priestly
code
with
that
of
tables
of
testimony
i
likewise
of
the
law
for
h
dwt
the
testimony
xi
read
hc
dwt
the
bracelets
according
to
i
and
when
it
occurs
in
older
narratives
is
proved
by
its
sporadic
appearance
as
well
as
by
a
comparison
of
the
septuagint
with
the
massoretic
text
to
be
a
correction
in
early
times
the
ark
was
not
a
mere
casket
for
the
law
the
the
ark
of
jehovah
was
of
itself
important
as
we
see
clearly
enough
from
like
the
twelve
maccebas
which
surrounded
the
altar
on
the
holy
hill
of
shechem
and
which
only
later
assumed
the
character
of
monuments
of
the
law
so
the
ark
of
the
covenant
no
doubt
arose
by
a
change
of
meaning
out
of
the
old
idol
if
there
were
stones
in
it
at
all
they
probably
served
some
other
purpose
than
that
of
writing
materials
otherwise
they
would
not
have
been
hidden
as
a
mystery
in
the
darkness
of
the
sanctuary
they
must
have
been
exposed
to
public
view
add
to
this
that
the
tradition
is
not
agreed
as
to
the
tenor
of
the
ten
words
said
to
have
been
inserted
on
the
two
tables
two
decalogues
being
preserved
to
us
exodus
xx
and
exodus
which
are
quite
different
from
each
other
it
results
from
this
that
there
was
no
real
or
certain
knowledge
as
to
what
stood
on
the
tables
and
further
that
if
there
were
such
stones
in
the
ark
and
probably
there
were
there
was
nothing
written
on
them
this
is
not
the
place
to
decide
which
of
the
two
versions
is
prior
to
the
other
the
negative
result
we
have
obtained
is
sufficient
for
our
present
purpose
ancient
israel
was
certainly
not
without
bases
for
the
ordering
of
human
life
only
they
were
not
fixed
in
writing
usage
and
tradition
were
looked
on
to
a
large
extent
as
the
institution
of
the
deity
thus
for
example
the
ways
and
rules
of
agriculture
jehovah
had
instructed
the
husbandman
and
taught
him
the
right
way
he
it
was
whose
authority
gave
to
the
unwritten
laws
of
custom
their
binding
power
it
is
never
so
done
in
israel
that
is
folly
in
israel
and
similar
expressions
of
insulted
public
conscience
are
of
frequent
occurrence
and
show
the
power
of
custom
the
fear
of
god
acts
as
a
motive
for
respecting
it
surely
there
is
no
fear
of
god
in
this
place
and
they
will
slay
me
for
my
wife
sake
so
abraham
says
to
himself
in
gerar
how
shall
i
do
such
great
wrong
and
sin
against
god
says
joseph
to
the
woman
in
egypt
the
people
of
sodom
were
wicked
and
sinned
grievously
against
jehovah
we
read
in
genesis
xiii
similarly
deuteronomy
xxv
the
amalekites
attacked
israel
on
the
march
and
killed
the
stragglers
all
that
were
feeble
and
fell
behind
and
feared
not
god
we
see
that
the
requirements
of
the
deity
are
known
and
of
force
not
to
the
israelites
only
but
to
all
the
world
and
accordingly
they
are
not
to
be
identified
with
any
positive
commands
the
patriarchs
observed
them
long
before
moses
i
know
abraham
jehovah
says
xviii
that
he
will
command
his
children
to
keep
the
way
of
jehovah
to
do
justice
and
judgment
much
greater
importance
is
attached
to
the
special
torah
of
jehovah
which
not
only
sets
up
laws
of
action
of
universal
validity
but
shows
man
the
way
in
special
cases
of
difficulty
where
he
is
at
a
loss
this
torah
is
one
of
the
special
gifts
with
which
israel
is
endowed
deuteronomy
xxxiii
and
it
is
intrusted
to
the
priests
whose
influence
during
the
period
of
the
hebrew
kings
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
rested
much
more
on
this
possession
than
on
the
privilege
of
sacrifice
the
verb
from
which
torah
is
derived
signifies
in
its
earliest
usage
to
give
direction
decision
the
participle
signifies
of
in
the
two
examples
and
the
latter
expression
is
explained
by
another
which
alternates
with
it
oak
of
the
soothsayers
now
we
know
that
the
priests
in
the
days
of
saul
and
david
gave
divine
oracles
by
the
ephod
and
the
lots
connected
with
it
which
answered
one
way
or
the
other
to
a
question
put
in
an
alternative
form
their
torah
grew
no
doubt
out
of
this
practice
the
urim
and
thummim
are
regarded
xiv
xxiii
xxx
in
connection
with
xxxi
i
have
conjectured
that
the
verb
of
which
torah
is
the
abstract
means
originally
to
throw
the
the
thummim
have
been
compared
in
the
most
felicitous
way
by
freytag
and
by
lagarde
independently
of
him

with
the
arabian
tamaim

not

signifies

but
any
means

probably
connected
with

the
two

mutually
to
supplement
each
other

to

itself

but
it
continued
to
be
an

it
is
only
a
power

can
be
no
abstract
the
teaching
is

thought
of

a
product

system
existing
independently

accessible

one

becomes

only
in

naturally
form
by
degrees

the
torah
of

to
have

were

the

thus
formed

voluntary

could
not

the
knowledge

which
hosea

regards
as
the
contents

a

with

as
its
practical
issue
is
that

requires
of
man
righteousness
and
faithfulness
and
it
is
fundamentally
and
essentially
morality
though
morality
at
that
time
addressed
its
demands
less
to
the
conscience
than
to
society
a
ritual
tradition
naturally
developed
itself
even
before
the
exile
xvii
but
only
those
rites
were
included
in
the
torah
which
the
priests
had
to
teach
others
not
those
which
they
discharged
themselves
even
in
leviticus
this
distinction
may
be
traced
the
instructions
characterised
as
toroth
being
chiefly
those
as
to
animals
which
might
or
might
not
be
eaten
as
to
clean
and
unclean
states
as
to
leprosy
and
its
marks
cf
deuteronomy
xxiv
so
it
was
in
israel
to
which
the
testimony
applies
which
we
have
cited
and
so
it
was
in
judah
also
there
was
a
common
proverb
in
the
days
of
jeremiah
and
ezekiel
the
torah
shall
not
perish
from
the
priest
nor
counsel
from
the
ancient
nor
the
word
from
the
prophet
but
no
doubt
the
saying
was
not
new
in
their
time
and
at
any
rate
it
will
apply
to
the
earlier
time
as
well
not
because
they
sacrifice
but
because
they
teach
do
the
priests
here
appear
as
pillars
of
the
religious
order
of
things
and
their
torah
is
a
living
power
equal
to
the
occasion
and
micah
reproaches
them
with
judging
for
reward
iii
and
this
shows
their
wisdom
to
have
been
based
on
a
tradition
accessible
to
them
alone
this
is
also
shown
by
some
expressions
of
deuteronomy
xvii
xxiv
we
have
the
counterpart
to
the
proverb
above
cited
jeremiah
xviii
ezekiel
vii
in
the
complaint
in
lamentations
ii
jerusalem
is
destroyed
her
king
and
her
princes
are
among
the
gentiles
the
torah
is
no
more
the
prophets
obtain
no
vision
from
jehovah
after
the
ruin
of
the
sanctuary
and
the
priests
there
is
no
longer
any
torah
and
if
that
be
so
the
axe
is
laid
to
the
root
of
the
life
of
the
people
in
the
prophets
the
torah
which
even
in
deuteronomy
xvii
was
mainly
legal
in
its
nature
acquires
a
strong
savour
of
ritual
which
one
did
not
notice
before
yet
even
here
it
is
still
an
oral
teaching
of
the
priests
haggai
ii
the
priests
derived
their
torah
from
moses
they
claimed
only
to
preserve
and
guard
what
moses
had
left

xxxiii
he
counted
as
their
ancestor

judges
xviii
his
father
is
the
priest
of
midian
at
mount
sinai
as
jehovah
also
is
derived
in
a
certain
sense
from
the
older
deity
of
sinai
but
at
the
same
time
moses
was
reputed
to
be
the
incomparable
originator
and
practicer
of
prophecy
numbers

deuteronomy

hos
xii
as
his
brother
aaron
also
is
not
only
a
levite
exodus

but
also
a
prophet
iv
numbers
xii
there
is
thus
a
close
relation
between
priests
and
prophets
seers
as
with
other
peoples
xviii
compare
with
x
so
also
with
the
hebrews
in
the
earliest
time
it
was
not
knowing
the
technique
of
worship
which
was
still
very
simple
and
undeveloped
but
being
a
man
of
god
standing
on
an
intimate
footing
with
god
that
made
a
man
a
priest
that
is
one
who
keeps
up
the
communication
with
heaven
for
others
and
the
seer
is
better
qualified
than
others
for
the
office
xviii
there
is
no
fixed
distinction
in
early
times
between
the
two
offices
samuel
is
in
an
aspirant
to
the
priesthood
in
ix
he
is
regarded
as
a
seer
in
later
times
also
when
priests
and
prophets
drew
off
and
separated
from
each
other
they
yet
remained
connected
both
in
the
kingdom
of
israel
host
iv
and
in
judah
in
the
latter
this
was
very
markedly
the
case
xxiii
jeremiah
xxvi
deuteronomy
xviii
zechariah
vii
what
connected
them
with
each
other
was
the
revelation
of
jehovah
which
went
on
and
was
kept
alive
in
both
of
them
it
is
jehovah
from
whom
the
torah
of
the
priest
and
the
word
of
the
prophet
proceeds
he
is
the
true
director
as
isaiah
calls
him
in
the
passage
xxx
where
speaking
of
the
messianic
time
he
says
to
the
people
then
thy
director
mwryk
is
no
more
concealed
but
thine
eyes
see
thy
director
and
thine
ears
hear
the
words
of
one
calling
behind
thee
this
is
the
way
walk
ye
in
it
when
ye
are
turning
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
torah
and
word
are
cognate
notions
and
capable
of
being
interchanged
deuteronomy
xxxiii
isaiah
i
ii
viii
this
explains
how
both
priests
and
prophets
claimed
moses
for
their
order
he
was
not
regarded
as
the
founder
of
the
cultus
the
difference
in
the
period
when
it
had
fully
developed
itself
may
be
said
to
be
this
the
torah
of
the
priests
was
like
a
spring
which
runs
always
that
of
the
prophets
like
a
spring
which
is
intermittent
but
when
it
does
break
forth
flows
with
all
the
greater
force
the
priests
take
precedence
of
the
prophets
when
both
are
named
together
they
obviously
consolidated
themselves
earlier
and
more
strongly
the
order
and
the
tradition
which
propagates
itself
within
the
order
are
essential
to
them
they
observe
and
keep
the
torah
deuteronomy
xxxiii
for
this
reason
that
they
take
their
stand
so
entirely
on
the
tradition
and
depend
on
it
their
claim
to
have
moses
for
their
father
the
beginner
and
founder
of
their
tradition
is
in
itself
the
better
founded
of
the
two
it
is
also
more
firmly
rooted
in
history
for
if
moses
did
anything
at
all
he
certainly
founded
the
sanctuary
at
kadesh
and
the
torah
there
which
the
priests
of
the
ark
carried
on
after
him
thus
continuing
the
thread
of
the
history
of
israel
which
was
taken
up
again
in
power
by
the
monarchy
the
prophets
only
appeared
among
the
hebrews
from
the
time
of
samuel
onwards
but
the
seers
were
older
than
moses
and
can
scarcely
have
had
such
a
close
connection
with
his
tradition
as
the
priests
at
the
sanctuary
of
the
ark
of
jehovah
in
the
ordinary
parlance
of
the
hebrews
torah
always
meant
first
and
chiefly
the
priestly
torah
the
prophets
have
notoriously
no
father
x
their
importance
rests
on
the
individuals
it
is
characteristic
that
only
names
and
sketches
of
their
lives
have
reached
us
they
do
indeed
following
the
tendency
of
the
times
draw
together
in
corporations
but
in
doing
so
they
really
renounce
their
own
distinctive
characteristics
the
representative
men
are
always
single
resting
on
nothing
outside
themselves
we
have
thus
on
the
one
side
the
tradition
of
a
class
which
suffices
for
the
occasions
of
ordinary
life
and
on
the
other
the
inspiration
of
awakened
individuals
stirred
up
by
occasions
which
are
more
than
ordinary
after
the
spirit
of
the
oldest
men
of
god
moses
at
the
head
of
them
had
been
in
a
fashion
laid
to
sleep
in
institutions
it
sought
and
found
in
the
prophets
a
new
opening
the
old
fire
burst
out
like
a
volcano
through
the
strata
which
once
too
rose
fluid
from
the
deep
but
now
were
fixed
and
dead
the
element
in
which
the
prophets
live
is
the
storm
of
the
history
which
sweeps
away
human
institutions
in
which
the
rubbish
of
past
generations
with
the
houses
built
on
it
begins
to
shake
and
that
foundation
alone
remains
firm
which
needs
no
support
but
itself
when
the
earth
trembles
and
seems
to
be
passing
away
then
they
triumph
because
jehovah
alone
is
exalted
they
do
not
preach
on
set
texts
they
speak
out
of
the
spirit
which
judges
all
things
and
itself
is
judged
of
no
man
where
do
they
ever
lean
on
any
other
authority
than
the
truth
of
what
they
say
where
do
they
rest
on
any
other
foundation
than
their
own
certainty
it
belongs
to
the
notion
of
prophecy
of
true
revelation
that
jehovah
overlooking
all
the
media
of
ordinances
and
institutions
communicates
himself
to
the
individual
the
called
one
in
whom
that
mysterious
and
irreducible
rapport
in
which
the
deity
stands
with
man
clothes
itself
with
energy
apart
from
the
prophet
there
is
no
revelation
it
lives
in
his
ego
this
gives
rise
to
a
synthesis
of
apparent
contradictions
the
subjective
in
the
highest
sense
which
is
exalted
above
all
ordinances
is
the
truly
objective
the
divine
this
it
proves
itself
to
be
by
the
consent
of
the
conscience
of
all
on
which
the
prophets
count
just
as
jesus
does
in
the
gospel
of
john
in
spite
of
all
their
polemic
against
the
traditional
religion
they
are
not
saying
anything
new
they
are
only
proclaiming
old
truth
while
acting
in
the
most
creative
way
they
feel
entirely
passive
the
tantum
et
which
may
with
perfect
justice
be
applied
to
such
men
as
elijah
amos
and
isaiah
is
with
them
equivalent
to
tantum
et
but
their
creed
is
not
to
be
found
in
any
book
it
is
barbarism
in
dealing
with
such
a
phenomenon
to
distort
its
physiognomy
by
introducing
the
law
it
is
a
vain
imagination
to
suppose
that
the
prophets
expounded
and
applied
the
law
malachi
circa
says
it
is
true
iv
remember
ye
the
torah
of
moses
my
servant
but
where
shall
we
look
for
any
second
expression
of
this
nature
much
more
correctly
than
modern
scholars
did
these
men
judge
who
at
the
close
of
the
preexilic
history
looked
back
on
the
forces
which
had
moulded
it
both
the
divine
and
those
opposed
to
god
in
their
eyes
the
prophets
are
not
the
expounders
of
moses
but
his
continuators
and
equals
the
word
of
god
in
their
mouth
is
not
less
weighty
than
in
the
mouth
of
moses
they
as
well
as
he
are
organs
of
the
spirit
of
jehovah
by
which
he
is
present
in
israel
the
immediate
revelation
to
the
people
we
read
in
deuteronomy
ceased
with
the
ten
commandments
from
that
point
onwards
jehovah
uses
the
prophets
as
his
mouth
a
prophet
like
unto
thee
he
says
to
moses
will
i
raise
up
to
them
from
among
their
brethren
and
will
put
my
words
in
his
mouth
and
he
shall
speak
unto
them
all
that
i
shall
command
him
and
whosoever
shall
not
hearken
unto
my
words
which
he
shall
speak
in
my
name
i
will
require
it
of
him
we
find
it
the
same
in
jeremiah
the
voice
of
the
prophets
always
sounding
when
there
is
need
for
it
occupies
the
place
which
according
to
the
prevailing
view
should
have
been
filled
by
the
law
this
living
command
of
jehovah
is
all
he
knows
of
and
not
any
testament
given
once
for
all
this
only
i
commanded
your
fathers
when
i
brought
them
up
out
of
egypt
obey
my
voice
and
walk
ye
in
all
the
ways
that
i
will
command
you
since
the
day
that
your
fathers
came
forth
out
of
egypt
i
have
sent
unto
you
all
my
servants
the
prophets
daily
rising
up
early
and
sending
them
but
ye
would
not
hear
and
even
after
the
exile
we
meet
in
zechariah
the
following
view
of
the
significance
of
the
prophets
thus
spake
jehovah
of
hosts
to
the
fathers
before
the
exile
speak
true
judgment
and
show
mercy
and
compassions
every
man
to
his
brother
and
oppress
not
the
widow
nor
the
fatherless
the
stranger
nor
the
poor
and
let
none
of
you
imagine
evil
against
his
brother
in
his
heart
but
they
refused
to
hearken
and
shrugged
the
shoulder
and
stopped
their
ears
that
they
should
not
hear
yea
they
made
their
hearts
as
a
flint
lest
they
should
hear
the
torah
and
the
words
which
jehovah
sebaoth
hath
sent
by
his
spirit
through
the
old
prophets
therefore
came
a
great
wrath
from
jehovah
sebaoth
and
as
he
cried
and
they
would
not
hear
so
now
shall
they
cry
and
i
will
not
hear
and
i
will
blow
them
away
among
the
peoples
thus
saith
jehovah
sebaoth
after
the
exile
to
the
present
generation
as
i
thought
to
punish
you
without
pity
because
your
fathers
provoked
me
to
anger
so
again
have
i
thought
in
these
days
to
do
well
to
the
house
of
judah
fear
ye
not
these
are
the
things
that
ye
shall
do
speak
ye
every
man
the
truth
to
his
neighbour
execute
the
judgment
of
truth
and
peace
in
your
gates
and
let
none
of
you
imagine
evil
in
your
hearts
against
his
neighbour
and
love
no
false
oath
for
all
these
are
things
which
i
hate
saith
jehovah
zechariah
vii
viii
the
contents
of
the
torah
on
obedience
to
which
the
theocracy
is
here
based
are
very
suggestive
as
also
its
derivation
from
the
old
prophets
even
ezra
can
say
ix
we
have
forsaken
thy
commandments
which
thou
hast
commanded
by
the
servants
the
prophets
saying
the
land
unto
which
ye
go
to
possess
it
is
an
unclean
land
with
the
filthiness
of
the
people
of
the
land
which
have
filled
it
from
one
end
to
another
with
their
uncleanness
he
is
thinking
of
deuteronomy
ezekiel
and
leviticus
of
those
who
at
the
end
reflected
on
the
meaning
of
the
development
which
had
run
its
course
the
writer
of
isaiah
occupies
the
first
place
the
torah
which
he
also
calls
right
truth
appears
to
him
to
be
the
divine
and
imperishable
element
in
israel
with
him
however
it
is
inseparable
from
its
mouthpiece
the
servant
of
jehovah
xlii
xlix
lii
the
name
would
denote
the
prophet
but
here
it
stands
for
the
people
a
prophet
on
a
large
scale
israel
calling
is
not
that
of
the
to
make
sensation
and
noise
in
the
streets
xiii
but
the
greater
one
of
promulgating
the
torah
and
getting
it
received
this
is
to
be
done
both
in
israel
and
among
the
heathen
what
makes
israel
a
prophet
is
not
his
own
inner
qualities
but
his
relation
to
jehovah
his
calling
as
the
depository
of
divine
truth
hence
it
involves
no
contradiction
that
the
servant
should
begin
his
work
in
israel
itself
this
is
as
if
one
were
to
say
that
there
is
much
to
be
done
before
we
evangelicals
are
truly
evangelical
yet
the
distinction
as
worked
out
in
isaiah
xl
seq
is
certainly
very
remarkable
and
speaks
for
a
surprising
degree
of
profound
meditation
till
now
he
has
spent
his
strength
only
in
the
bosom
of
his
own
people
which
is
always
inclined
to
fall
away
from
jehovah
and
from
itself
heedless
of
reproach
and
suffering
he
has
laboured
unweariedly
in
carrying
out
the
behests
of
his
master
and
has
declared
his
word
all
in
vain
he
has
not
been
able
to
avert
the
victory
of
heathenism
in
israel
now
followed
by
its
victory
over
israel
now
in
the
exile
jehovah
has
severed
his
relation
with
his
people
the
individual
hebrews
survive
but
the
servant
the
people
of
jehovah
is
dead
then
is
the
torah
to
die
with
him
and
truth
itself
to
succumb
to
falsehood
to
heathenism
that
can
not
be
truth
must
prevail
must
come
to
the
light
as
to
the
apostle
paul
the
spirit
is
the
earnest
of
the
resurrection
of
those
who
are
born
again
so
to
our
author
the
torah
is
the
pledge
of
the
resurrection
of
israel
the
justification
of
the
servant
of
jehovah
the
final
triumph
of
the
cause
which
is
god
will
surpass
all
expectations
not
only
in
israel
itself
will
the
torah
will
the
servant
of
jehovah
prevail
and
bring
about
a
regeneration
of
the
people
the
truth
will
in
the
future
shine
forth
from
israel
into
the
whole
world
and
obtain
the
victory
among
all
the
gentiles
xlix
then
it
will
appear
that
the
work
of
the
servant
resultless
as
it
seemed
to
be
up
to
the
exile
has
yet
not
been
in
vain
it
is
surely
unnecessary
for
me
to
demonstrate
how
uncommonly
vivid
i
might
say
how
uncommonly
historical
the
notion
of
the
torah
is
as
here
set
forth
and
how
entirely
incompatible
that
notion
is
with
the
torah
of
moses
it
might
most
fitly
be
compared
with
the
logos
of
the
prologue
of

if
the
latter
is
understood
in
accordance
with

x
an
utterance
certainly
authentic
and
not
according
to
philo
as
jesus
is
the
revelation
of
god
made
man
so
the
servant
of
jehovah
is
the
revelation
of
god
made
a
people
the
similarity
of
their
nature
and
their
significance
involves
the
similarity
of
their
work
and
of
their
sufferings
so
that
the
messianic
interpretation
of
isaiah
lii
is
in
fact
one
which
could
not
fail
to
suggest
itself
the
personification
is
carried
further
in
this
passage
than
anywhere
else
and
it
is
possible
that
the
colours
of
the
sketch
are
borrowed
from
some
actual
instance
of
a
yet
the
ebed
jahve
can
not
have
a
different
meaning
here
from
that
which
it
has
everywhere
else
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
sufferings
and
death
of
the
servant
are
in
the
past
and
his
glorification
in
the
future
a
long
pause
lying
between
them
in
the
present
a
resurrection
of
the
individual
could
not
be
in
the
mind
of
the
writer
of
isaiah
xl
nor
do
the
details
of
the
description
lii
at
all
agree
with
such
an
idea
moreover
it
is
clear
that
liv
is
a
kind
of
sermon
on
the
text
lii
and
there
the
prophecy
of
the
glorification
of
the
servant
has
reference
to
zion
see
vatke
seq
in
the
year
of
king
josiah
deuteronomy
was
found
and
published
in
the
account
of
the
discovery
xxii
it
is
always
called
simply
book
of
the
it
was
accordingly
the
first
and
in
its
time
the
only
book
of
the
kind
it
is
certainly
the
case
that
the
prophets
had
written
down
some
of
their
speeches
before
this
and
the
priests
also
may
before
this
time
have
written
down
many
of
their
precepts
it
appears
in
fact
as
vatke
surmises
that
we
have
a
monument
of
their
spirit
in
the
sinaitic
book
of
the
covenant
deuteronomy
presupposes
earlier
attempts
of
this
kind
and
borrows
its
materials
largely
from
them
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
distinguished
from
them
not
only
by
its
greater
compass
but
also
by
its
much
higher
claims
it
is
written
with
the
distinct
intention
not
to
remain
a
private
memorandum
but
to
obtain
public
authority
as
a
book
the
idea
of
making
a
definite
formulated
written
torah
the
law
of
the
land
is
the
important
point
duhm
ap
cil
it
was
a
first
attempt
and
succeeded
at
the
outset
beyond
expectation
a
reaction
set
in
afterwards
it
is
true
but
the
babylonian
exile
completed
the
triumph
of
the
law
extraordinary
excitement
was
at
that
time
followed
by
the
deepest
depression
amos
viii
at
such
a
time
those
who
did
not
despair
of
the
future
clung
anxiously
to
the
religious
acquisitions
of
the
past
these
had
been
put
in
a
book
just
in
time
in
deuteronomy
with
a
view
to
practical
use
in
the
civil
and
religious
life
of
the
people
the
book
of
the
torah
did
not
perish
in
the
general
ruin
but
remained
in
existence
and
was
the
compass
of
those
who
were
shaping
their
course
for
a
new
israel
how
thoroughly
determined
they
were
to
use
it
as
their
rule
we
see
from
the
revision
of
the
hexateuch
and
of
the
historical
books
which
was
taken
in
hand
during
the
exile
with
the
appearance
of
the
law
came
to
an
end
the
old
freedom
not
only
in
the
sphere
of
worship
now
restricted
to
jerusalem
but
in
the
sphere
of
the
religious
spirit
as
well
there
was
now
in
existence
an
authority
as
objective
as
could
be
and
this
was
the
death
of
prophecy
for
it
was
a
necessary
condition
of
prophecy
that
the
tares
should
be
at
liberty
to
grow
up
beside
the
wheat
the
signs
given
in
deuteronomy
to
distinguish
the
true
from
the
false
prophet
are
no
doubt
vague
and
unpractical
still
they
show
the
tendency
towards
control
and
the
introduction
of
uniformity
that
is
the
great
step
which
is
new
the
difference
between
deuteronomy
xviii
and
xxii
may
be
thought
to
throw
light
on
the
two
positions
in
the
former
passage
we
read
that
if
a
prophet
says
something
in
the
name
of
jehovah
which
does
not
come
to
pass
it
is
a
word
which
jehovah
has
not
spoken
here
on
the
contrary
micaiah
ben
imlah
when
the
prophets
of
jehovah
promise
the
king
of
israel
a
happy
issue
of
the
campaign
against
the
syrians
regards
the
prediction
as
contrary
to
the
truth
but
as
none
the
less
on
that
account
inspired
by
the
spirit
of
prophecy
jehovah
he
said
had
made
his
spirit
a
iying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets
it
may
be
that
this
difference
reflects
to
us
the
interval
between
two
different
ages
but
on
the
whole
micaiah
view
appears
to
be
rather
a
piece
of
ingenuity
which
might
have
been
resorted
to
in
later
times
as
well
in
the
seventh
century
the
command
every
firstborn
is
mine
was
held
to
apply
to
the
human
firstborn
as
well
the
sacrifice
of
which
jehovah
was
thought
to
require
this
appears
from
jeremiah
protest
i
commanded
them
not
neither
came
it
into
my
mind
vii
xix
with
reference
to
this
ezekiel
says
that
because
the
israelites
despised
the
wholesome
commandments
of
jehovah
he
gave
them
laws
which
were
not
good
and
statutes
by
which
they
could
not
live
that
is
a
similar
ingenious
escape
from
a
difficulty
without
deeper
meaning
see
the
converse
koran
sura
ii
it
certainly
was
not
the
intention
of
the
legislator
to
encroach
upon
the
spoken
torah
or
the
free
word
but
the
consequence
favoured
by
outward
circumstances
was
not
to
be
avoided
the
feeling
that
the
prophets
had
come
to
an
end
did
not
arise
in
the
maccabean
wars
only
in
the
exile
we
hear
the
complaint
that
the
instruction
of
the
priests
and
the
word
of
the
prophets
are
silent
lamentations
ii
it
is
asked
where
he
is
who
in
former
times
put
his
spirit
in
israel
isa
lxiii
in
nehemiah
time
a
doubtful
question
is
left
unsettled
at
least
theoretically
till
the
priest
with
urim
and
thummim
with
a
trustworthy
prophecy
shall
appear
nehemiah
vii
we
may
call
jeremiah
the
last
of
the
prophets
in
his
early
years
jeremiah
had
a
share
in
the
introduction
of
the
law
but
in
later
times
he
shows
himself
little
edified
by
the
effects
it
produced
the
iying
pen
of
the
scribes
he
says
has
written
for
a
lie
people
despised
the
prophetic
word
because
they
had
the
torah
in
black
and
white
viii
those
who
came
after
him
were
prophets
only
in
name
ezekiel
had
swallowed
a
book
iii
and
gave
it
out
again
he
also
like
zechariah
calls
the
prophets
the
old
prophets
conscious
that
he
himself
belongs
to
the
epigoni
he
meditates
on
their
words
like
daniel
and
comments
on
them
in
his
own
prophecy
xxxviii
xxxix
the
writer
of
isaiah
xl
seq
might
with
much
more
reason
be
called
a
prophet
but
he
does
not
claim
to
be
one
his
anonymity
which
is
evidently
intentional
leaves
no
doubt
as
to
this
he
is
in
fact
more
of
a
theologian
he
is
principally
occupied
in
reflecting
on
the
results
of
the
foregoing
development
of
which
prophecy
had
been
the
leaven
these
are
fixed
possessions
now
secured
he
is
gathering
in
the
harvest
as
for
the
prophets
after
the
exile
we
have
already
seen
how
zechariah
speaks
of
the
old
prophets
as
a
series
which
is
closed
in
which
he
and
those
like
him
are
not
to
be
reckoned
in
the
writing
of
an
anonymous
contemporary
which
is
appended
to
his
book
we
find
the
following
notable
expression
in
that
day
saith
jehovah
i
will
cut
off
the
names
of
the
idols
out
of
the
land
that
they
be
no
more
remembered
and
also
i
will
cause
to
cease
the
prophets
and
the
unclean
spirit
and
if
a
man
will
yet
prophesy
his
parents
shall
say
unto
him
thou
shalt
not
live
for
thou
speakest
lies
in
the
name
of
jehovah
and
his
parents
shall
thrust
him
through
when
he
prophesieth
xiii
deuteronomy
was
the
programme
of
a
reform
not
of
a
restoration
it
took
for
granted
the
existence
of
the
cultus
and
only
corrected
it
in
certain
general
respects
but
the
temple
was
now
destroyed
and
the
worship
interrupted
and
the
practice
of
past
times
had
to
be
written
down
if
it
was
not
to
be
lost
thus
it
came
about
that
in
the
exile
the
conduct
of
worship
became
the
subject
of
the
torah
and
in
this
process
reformation
was
naturally
aimed
at
as
well
as
restoration
we
have
seen
that
ezekiel
was
the
first
to
take
this
step
which
the
circumstances
of
the
time
indicated
in
the
last
part
of
his
work
he
made
the
first
attempt
to
record
the
ritual
which
had
been
customary
in
the
temple
of
jerusalem
other
priests
attached
themselves
to
him
leviticus
and
thus
there
grew
up
in
the
exile
from
among
the
members
of
this
profession
a
kind
of
school
of
people
who
reduced
to
writing
and
to
a
system
what
they
had
formerly
practiced
in
the
way
of
their
calling
after
the
temple
was
restored
this
theoretical
zeal
still
continued
to
work
and
the
ritual
when
renewed
was
still
further
developed
by
the
action
and
reaction
on
each
other
of
theory
and
practice
the
priests
who
had
stayed
in
babylon
took
as
great
a
part
from
a
distance
in
the
sacred
services
as
their
brothers
at
jerusalem
who
had
actually
to
conduct
them
the
latter
indeed
lived
in
adverse
circumstances
and
do
not
appear
to
have
conformed
with
great
strictness
or
accuracy
to
the
observances
which
had
been
agreed
upon
the
last
result
of
this
labour
of
many
years
is
the
priestly
code
it
has
indeed
been
said
that
we
can
not
ascribe
the
creation
of
such
a
work
to
an
age
which
was
bent
on
nothing
but
repristination
granted
that
this
is
a
correct
description
of
it
such
an
age
is
peculiarly
fitted
for
an
artificial
systematising
of
given
materials
and
this
is
what
the
originality
of
the
priestly
code
in
substance
amounts
to
dillmann
arrives
at
the
conclusion
that
the
assumption
is
the
most
natural
one
in
the
world
and
still
capable
of
proof
from
acd
that
the
priesthood
of
the
central
sanctuary
wrote
down
their
toroth
even
in
early
times
and
that
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
the
priestly
and
ceremonial
laws
were
first
written
down
or
even
made
in
the
exile
and
in
babylon
where
there
was
no
worship
we
will
let
it
be
absurd
if
it
is
true
it
is
not
progress
though
it
is
a
fact
that
the
kings
were
succeeded
by
the
and
the
prophets
by
the
rabbis
yet
it
is
a
thing
which
is
likely
to
occur
that
a
body
of
traditional
practice
should
only
be
written
down
when
it
is
threatening
to
die
out
and
that
a
book
should
be
as
it
were
the
ghost
of
a
life
which
is
closed
the
priestly
code
worked
into
the
pentateuch
as
the
standard
legislative
element
in
it
became
the
definite
mosaic
law
as
such
it
was
published
and
introduced
in
the
year
a
century
after
the
exile
in
the
interval
the
duration
of
which
is
frequently
deuteronomy
alone
had
been
known
and
recognised
as
the
written
torah
though
as
a
fact
the
essays
of
ezekiel
and
his
successors
may
have
had
no
inconsiderable
influence
in
leading
circles
the
man
who
made
the
pentateuch
the
constitution
of
judaism
was
the
babylonian
priest
and
scribe
ezra
he
had
come
from
babylon
to
jerusalem
as
early
as
the
year
the
seventh
of
artaxerxes
longimanus
at
the
head
of
a
considerable
company
of
zealous
jews
provided
it
is
said
with
a
mandate
from
the
persian
king
empowering
him
to
reform
according
to
the
law
the
congregation
of
the
temple
which
had
not
yet
been
able
to
consolidate
itself
inwardly
nor
to
shut
itself
off
sufficiently
from
those
without
thou
art
sent
of
the
king
and
of
his
seven
counsellors
to
hold
an
inquiry
concerning
judah
and
jerusalem
to
the
law
of
thy
god
which
is
in
thine
thou
ezra
according
to
wisdom
of
thy
god
which
is
in
thine
set
magistrates
and
judges
which
may
judge
all
the
people
that
are
beyond
the
river
all
such
as
acknowledge
the
laws
of
thy
god
and
teach
ye
them
that
know
them
not
and
whosoever
will
not
do
the
law
of
thy
god
and
the
law
of
the
king
let
him
be
prosecuted
so
we
read
in
the
commission
of
the
persian
king
to
ezra
vii
which
even
should
it
be
spurious
must
yet
reflect
the
views
of
his
contemporaries
the
expression
taken
from
own
memoirs
vii
leaves
no
doubt
that
he
was
assisted
by
artaxerxes
in
the
objects
he
had
in
view
with
regard
to
his
relation
to
the
law
we
have
to
consider
the
following
points
he
was
a
scribe
swpr
literatus
at
home
in
the
torah
of
moses
vii
he
had
directed
his
mind
to
study
the
torah
of
jehovah
and
to
do
and
to
teach
in
israel
judgment
and
statute
vii
the
priest
ezra
the
master
of
the
law
of
the
god
of
heaven
vii
the
most
important
expression
however
is
that
which
states
that
the
law
the
wisdom
of
his
god
was
in
his
hand
thus
it
was
his
private
property
though
it
claimed
authority
for
all
israel
with
this
agree
the
statements
as
to
the
object
of
the
learned
priest
mission
but
ezra
did
not
as
we
should
expect
at
once
introduce
the
law
on
his
arrival
in
judah
in
concert
with
the
heads
of
the
people
and
proceeding
on
the
existing
torah
that
namely
of
deuteronony
he
ordained
and
relentlessly
carried
out
a
strict
separation
of
the
returned
exiles
from
the
heathen
and
inhabitants
of
the
land
this
was
done
a
few
months
after
his
arrival
in
jerusalem
but
a
long
time
at
least
fourteen
years
elapsed
before
he
produced
the
law
which
he
had
brought
with
him
why
he
delayed
so
long
we
can
at
the
best
only
surmise
as
no
accounts
have
reached
us
of
what
he
did
in
the
interval
there
is
a
great
gap
in
the
narrative
of
the
books
of
ezra
and
nehemiah
between
the
and
the
year
of
artaxerxes
perhaps
the
outward
circumstances
of
the
young
community
which
probably
in
consequence
of
the
repellent
attitude
taken
up
to
the
surrounding
peoples
were
not
of
the
happiest
made
it
unadvisable
at
once
to
introduce
a
legislative
innovation
perhaps
too
ezra
desired
to
wait
to
see
the
correcting
influence
of
the
practice
of
jerusalem
on
the
product
of
babylonian
scholarship
and
moreover
to
train
up
assistants
for
the
work
the
principal
reason
however
appears
to
have
been
that
in
spite
of
the
of
the
king
he
did
not
enjoy
the
energetic
support
of
the
persian
authorities
on
the
spot
and
could
not
without
it
get
the
authority
of
the
new
law
recognised
but
in
the
year
it
came
about
that
a
jew
and
a
sympathiser
of
ezra
nehemiah
ben
hakkelejah
and
favourite
of
artaxerxes
appeared
in
judea
as
persian
governor
with
straightforward
earnestness
he
first
addressed
himself
to
the
task
of
liberating
the
jewish
community
from
outward
pressure
and
lifting
them
up
from
their
depressed
condition
and
this
being
accomplished
the
time
had
come
to
go
forward
with
the
introduction
of
the
pentateuch
ezra
and
nehemiah
were
manifestly
in
concert
as
to
this
on
the
day
of
the
month
we
do
not
know
the
year
but
it
can
not
have
been
earlier
than
the
whole
people
came
together
as
one
man
before
the
and
ezra
was
called
on
to
produce
the
book
of
the
law
of
moses
which
jehovah
had
commanded
israel
the
scribe
mounted
a
wooden
pulpit
seven
priests
stood
beside
him
on
the
right
hand
and
seven
on
the
left
when
he
opened
the
book
all
present
stood
up
both

with

they
joined
in
the
opening
blessing
lifted
up
their
heads
and
cast
themselves
on
the
ground
then
he
read
the
book
from
early
morning
till
in
small
sections
which
were
repeated
and
expounded
by
a
number
of
levites
dispersed
throughout
the
crowd
the
effect
was
that
a
general
weeping
arose
the
people
being
aware
that
they
had
not
till
then
followed
the
commandments
of
god
nehemiah
and
ezra
and
the
levites
had
to
allay
the
excitement
and
said
this
day
is
holy
unto
jehovah
your
god
mourn
not
nor
weep
go
your
way
eat
the
fat
and
drink
the
sweet
and
give
unto
them
that
have
brought
nothing
with
them
the
assembled
people
then
dispersed
and
set
on
foot
a
great
mirth
because
they
had
understood
the
words
which
had
been
communicated
to
them
the
reading
was
continued
the
next
day
but
before
the
heads
of
families
only
and
a
very
appropriate
section
was
read
the
ordinances
as
to
festivals
and
particularly
that
about
the
feast
of
tabernacles
which
was
to
be
kept
under
branches
of
trees
on
the
day
of
the
month
the
month
then
just
beginning
the
matter
was
taken
up
with
the
greatest
zeal
and
the
festival
which
had
not
been
kept
rite
sic
since
the
days
of
joshua
ben
nun
was
now
instituted
in
accordance
with
the
precepts
of
leviticus
xxiii
and
celebrated
with
general
enthusiasm
from
the
to
the
of
the
month
for
eight
days
according
to
leviticus
xxiii
as
against
deuteronomy
xvi
on
the
however
a
great
day
of
humiliation
was
held
with
sackcloth
and
ashes
on
this
occasion
also
the
proceedings
began
with
reading
the
law
and
then
followed
a
confession
of
sins
spoken
by
the
levites
in
the
name
of
the
people
and
concluding
with
a
prayer
for
mercy
and
compassion
this
was
preparatory
to
the
principal
and
concluding
act
in
which
the
secular
and
spiritual
officials
and
elders
in
number
bound
themselves
in
writing
to
the
book
of
the
law
published
by
ezra
and
all
the
rest
undertook
an
obligation
with
oath
and
curse
to
walk
in
the
torah
of
god
given
by
his
servant
moses
and
to
keep
all
the
commandments
of
jehovah
and
his
statutes
and
laws
special
attention
was
directed
to
such
provisions
of
the
pentateuch
as
were
of
immediate
importance
for
the
people
in
the
circumstances
of
the
day
the
greater
part
of
the
whole
work
is
about
the
ritual
of
the
priests
and
those
were
in
particular
insisted
on
which
refer
to
the
contributions
of
the
laity
to
the
priesthood
on
which
the
very
existence
of
the
hierocracy
depended

the
credibility
of
the
narrative
appears
on
the
face
of
it
the
writer
of
chronicles
did
not
write
it
himself
but
took
it
from
his
main
source
from
which
also
he
drew
the
fragments
he
gives
us
of
the
memoirs
of
ezra
and
nehemiah
this
we
see
from
the
fact
that
while
copying
nehemiah
vii
in
ezra
ii
he
unconsciously
goes
on
with
the
beginning
of
nehemiah
viii
ezra
iii
that
shows
that
he
found
nehemiah
vii
and
viii
in
their
present
connection
and
did
not
write
viii
seq
himself
as
we
might
suppose
lagarde
expresses
great
surprise
and
the
surprise
is
reasonable
that
so
little
importance
is
attributed
to
this
narrative
by
old

critics
only

it
is
obvious
that
nehemiah
is
a
close
parallel
to
xxii
especially
to
xxiii
there
we
read
that
josiah
caused
all
the
elders
of
judah
and
jerusalem
to
come
together
and
went
up
with
the
men
of
judah
and
the
inhabitants
of
jerusalem
with
the
priests
and
the
prophets
and
all
the
people
high
and
low
to
the
house
of
jehovah
where
he
read
to
the
assemblage
all
the
words
of
the
book
of
the
law
and
bound
himself
with
all
the
people
before
jehovah
to
keep
all
the
words
of
the
book
just
as
it
is
in
evidence
that
deuteronomy
became
known
in
the
year
and
that
it
was
unknown
up
to
that
date
so
it
is
in
evidence
that
the
remaining
torah
of
the
pentateuch
for
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
law
of
ezra
was
the
whole
pentateuch
became
known
in
the
year
and
was
unknown
till
then
this
shows
in
the
first
place
and
puts
it
beyond
question
that
deuteronomy
is
the
first
and
the
priestly
torah
the
second
stage
of
the
legislation
but
in
the
second
place
as
we
are
accustomed
to
infer
the
date
of
the
composition
of
deuteronomy
from
its
publication
and
introduction
by
josiah
so
we
must
infer
the
date
of
the
composition
of
the
priestly
code
from
its
publication
and
introduction
by
ezra
and
nehemiah
it
would
require
very
strong
internal
evidence
to
destroy
the
probability
thus
based
on
a
most
positive
statement
of
facts
that
the
codification
of
the
ritual
only
took
place
in
the
period
we
have
already
seen
of
what
nature
the
internal
evidence
is
which
is
brought
forward
with
this
view
it
is
not
however
necessary
and
it
can
scarcely
be
correct
to
make
ezra
more
than
the
editor
the
real
and
principal
editor
of
the
hexateuch
and
in
particular
he
is
not
likely
to
have
been
the
author
of
q
nor
on
the
other
hand
is
it
meant
to
deny
that
many
new
features
may
have
been
added
and
alterations
made
after
ezra
a
body
of
customs
is
a
subject
which
can
scarcely
be
treated
quite
exhaustively
there
are
no
directions
about
the
nerve
about
the
priests
having
their
feet
bare
about
shutting
up
before

who
are
named
as
signatories
of

are
regarded
by
later
tradition
as
the
founders
of
the
canon
and
not
without
reason
only
king
josiah
has
a
still
stronger
claim
to
this
place
of
honour
the
introduction
of
the
law
first
deuteronomy
and
then
the
whole
pentateuch
was
in
fact
the
decisive
step
by
which
the
written
took
the
place
of
the
spoken
word
and
the
people
of
the
word
became
a
people
of
the
book
to
the
book
were
added
in
course
of
time
the
books
the
former
was
formally
and
solemnly
introduced
in
two
successive
acts
the
latter
acquired
imperceptibly
a
similar
public
authority
for
the
jewish
church
the
notion
of
the
canon
proceeds
entirely
from
that
of
the
written
torah
the
prophets
and
the
hagiographa
are
also
called
torah
by
the
jews
though
not
torah
of
moses
the
origin
of
the
canon
thus
lies
thanks
to
the
two
narratives
xxii
nehemiah
in
the
full
light
of
history
but
the
traditional
science
of
biblical
introduction
has
no
clear
or
satisfactory
account
to
give
of
it
josiah
the
ordinary
notion
is
introduced
the
law
but
not
the
canon
ezra
on
the
other
hand
the
canon
and
not
the
law
an
analogy
drawn
from
the
secondary
part
of
the
canon
the
prophets
and
hagiographa
is
applied
without
consideration
to
the
primary
part
the
torah
of
moses
the
historical
and
prophetical
books
were
in
part
at
least
a
long
time
in
existence
before
they
became
canonical
and
the
same
it
is
thought
might
be
the
case
with
the
law
but
the
case
of
the
law
is
essentially
different
the
law
claims
to
have
public
authority
to
be
a
book
of
the
community
the
difference
between
law
and
canon
does
not
exist
hence
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
the
torah
though
as
a
literary
product
later
than
the
historical
and
prophetical
books
is
yet
as
law
older
than
these
writings
which
have
originally
and
in
their
nature
no
legal
character
but
only
acquired
such
a
character
in
a
sort
of
metaphorical
way
through
their
association
with
the
law
itself
when
it
is
recognised
that
the
canon
is
what
distinguishes
judaism
from
ancient
israel
it
is
recognised
at
the
same
time
that
what
distinguishes
judaism
from
ancient
israel
is
the
written
torah

this

speaks

before

it
is
well
known
the
sacred
community
of
his
own
day
as
it
existed
down
to
the
year
in
ancient
israel
the
theocracy
never
existed
in
fact
as
a
form
of
constitution
the
rule
of
jehovah
is
here
an
ideal
representation
only
after
the
exile
was
it
attempted
to
realise
it
in
the
shape
of
a
rule
of
the
holy
with
outward
means
it
is
perhaps
the
principal
merit
of
vatke
biblical
theology
to
have
traced
through
the
centuries
the
rise
of
the
theocracy
and
the
metamorphosis
of
the
idea
to
an
institution
the
upholders
of
the
prevailing
view
do
not
assert
that
moses
wrote
the
pentateuch
but
they
maintain
all
the
more
firmly
that
he
organised
the
congregation
of
the
tabernacle
in
the
wilderness
after
the
fashion
described
in
the
priestly
code
they
seem
to
think
that
moses
had
no
importance
further
than
this
as
if
it
were
an
act
of
no
moment
to
cast
into
the
field
of
time
a
seed
which
the
action
and
reaction
thence
arising
bring
an
immeasurable
time
after
to
maturity
mark
iv
in
fact
moses
is
the
originator
of
the
mosaic
constitution
in
about
the
same
way
as
peter
is
the
founder
of
the
roman
hierarchy
of
the
sacred
organisation
supposed
to
have
existed
from
the
earliest
times
there
is
no
trace
in
the
time
of
the
judges
and
the
kings
it
is
thought
to
have
been
a
sort
of
pedagogic
to
subdue
the
ungovernable
obstinacy
of
the
hebrews
and
to
guard
them
from
evil
influences
from
without
but
even
should
it
be
conceded
that
a
constitution
could
come
into
existence
in
ancient
times
which
was
so
utterly
out
of
relation
to
the
peculiar
life
and
temper
of
the
people
the
history
of
the
ancient
israelites
shows
us
nothing
so
distinctly
as
the
uncommon
freshness
and
naturalness
of
their
impulses
the
persons
who
appear
always
act
from
the
constraining
impulse
of
their
nature
the
men
of
god
not
less
than
the
murderers
and
adulterers
they
are
such
figures
as
could
only
grow
up
in
the
open
air
judaism
which
realised
the
mosaic
constitution
and
carried
it
out
logically
left
no
free
scope
for
the
individual
but
in
ancient
israel
the
divine
right
did
not
attach
to
the
institution
but
was
in
the
creator
spirit
in
individuals
not
only
did
they
speak
like
the
prophets
they
also
acted
like
the
judges
and
kings
from
their
own
free
impulse
not
in
accordance
with
an
outward
norm
and
yet
or
just
because
of
this
in
the
spirit
of
jehovah
the
different
view
of
different
times
is
seen
very
characteristically
in
the
views
taken
of
saul
by
the
two
versions
above
sifted
and
compared
it
is
a
simple
and
yet
a
very
important
remark
of
vatke
that
the
sacred
constitution
of
the
congregation
so
circumstantially
described
to
us
in
the
priestly
code
is
after
all
very
defective
and
presupposes
the
existence
of
that
which
it
was
the
chief
task
of
the
age
of
moses
to
bring
about
namely
the
state
in
the
absence
of
which
the
church
can
not
have
any
subsistence
either
to
maintain
an
elaborate
and
expensive
worship
and
an
immense
swarm
of
clergy
must
have
required
considerable
rates
and
taxes
and
to
raise
these
as
well
as
to
uphold
the
authority
of
the
sacred
persons
and
institutions
and
most
of
all
to
enforce
the
strict
centralization
and
uniformity
of
the
legitimate
worship
all
this
among
a
people
not
yet
very
civilised
must
have
required
an
executive
power
which
embraced
and
was
able
to
control
the
whole
people
but
where
is
this
central
authority
in
the
period
of
the
judges
judicial
competence
resided
at
that
time
chiefly
in
the
smallest
circles
the
families
and
houses
these
were
but
little
controlled
as
it
appears
by
the
superior
power
of
the
tribe
and
the
very
notion
of
the
state
or
of
the
kingdom
did
not
as
yet
exist
houses
related
to
each
other
sometimes
united
for
common
undertakings
as
no
doubt
also
did
neighbouring
tribes
but
this
was
not
on
the
basis
of
any
constitutional
order
but
from
necessity
when
it
happened
that
a
man
came
forward
to
take
the
command
and
his
summons
to
the
levy
was
obeyed
these
transient
combinations
under
generals
were
the
forerunners
of
a
permanent
union
under
a
king
and
even
at
the
time
of
the
midianite
war
an
attempt
seems
to
have
been
made
in
this
direction
which
however
was
not
quite
successful
in
the
severe
and
protracted
struggle
with
the
philistines
the
necessity
for
a
solid
union
of
the
tribes
was
cryingly
manifest
and
the
man
came
forward
to
meet
the
hour
saul
a
distinguished
benjamite
of
gibeah
was
overcome
by
anger
at
the
scornful
challenge
which
even
the
ammonites
ventured
at
such
a
time
to
cast
in
the
teeth
of
his
people
he
called
his
to
battle
not
in
virtue
of
any
office
he
held
but
on
the
strength
of
his
own
impulses
his
enthusiasm
proved
contagious
none
dared
to
say
him
nay
he
began
his
career
just
like
one
of
the
earlier
judges
but
after
he
had
led
his
people
to
victory
they
did
not
let
him
retire
again
the
person
sought
for
the
king
was
found
out
of
such
natural
beginnings
did
the
state
at
that
time
arise
it
owed
nothing
to
the
pattern
of
the
mosaic
theocracy
but
bears
all
the
marks
of
a
new
creation

david
was
in
the
eyes
of
later
generations
inseparable
from

idea

he
was

excellence
saul

thrown
into
the
shade
but
both
together
are
the
founders
of

and
have
thus
a
much
wider
importance
than
any
of
their
successors
it
was
they
who
drew
the
life
of
the
people
together
at
a
centre
and
gave
it
an
aim
to
them
the

for
its
historical

built
up

it
is
the
soil
out
of
which
all
the
other
institutions
of
israel
grow
up
in
the
time
of
the
judges
we
read
every
man
did
that
which
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
not
because
the
mosaic
constitution
was
not
in
force
but
because
there
was
no
king
in
those
days
the
consequences
were
very
important
in
the
sphere
of
religion
as
well
since
the
political
advance
of
the
people
brought
the
historic
and
national
character
of
jehovah
to
the
front
again
during
the
time
of
the
judges
the
canaanite
festival
cultus
had
gradually
been
coming
to
be
embodied
in
the
worship
of
jehovah
a
process
which
was
certainly
necessary
but
in
this
process
there
was
for
some
time
a
danger
that
jehovah
would
become
a
god
of
husbandry
and
of
cattle
like
the
festivals
long
continued
to
be
a
source
of
heathenism
but
now
they
were
gradually
divested
of
their
character
as
and
forced
at
length
to
have
reference
to
the
nation
and
to
its
history
if
they
were
not
to
disappear
completely
the
relation
of
jehovah
to
people
and
kingdom
remained
firm
as
a
rock
even
to
the
worst
idolaters
he
was
the
god
of
israel
in
war
no
one
thought
of
looking
for
victory
and
success
to
any
other
god
this
was
the
result
of
becoming
a
kingdom
the
kingship
of
jehovah
in
that
precise
sense
which
we
associate
with
it
is
the
religious
expression
of
the
fact
of
the
foundation
of
the
kingdom
by
saul
and
david
the
theocracy
was
the
state
of
itself
the
ancient
israelites
regarded
the
civil
state
as
a
miracle
or
in
their
own
words
a
help
of
god
when
the
later
jews
thought
or
spoke
of
the
theocracy
they
took
the
state
for
granted
as
already
there
and
so
they
could
build
the
theocracy
on
the
top
of
it
as
a
specially
spiritual
feature
just
as
we
moderns
sometimes
see
the
divine
element
in
settled
ordinances
such
as
marriage
not
in
their
own
nature
but
in
the
consecration
added
to
them
by
the
church
the
kingdom
of
saul
and
david
did
not
long
remain
at
its
height
decay
set
in
even
at
the
separation
and
when
once
the
assyrians
were
heard
at
the
door
it
advanced
with
steps
not
to
be
arrested
but
the
memory
of
the
period
of
glory
and
power
was
all
the
greener
and
the
hope
arose
of
its
return
from
the
contrast
between
the
sorrowful
present
and
the
brilliant
past
there
arose
the
picture
of
the
state
as
it
should
be
when
ruin
was
seen
without
and
anarchy
within
the
prophets
set
against
this
the
pattern
of
the
theocracy
the
theocracy
as
the
prophets
represent
it
to
themselves
is
not
a
thing
essentially
different
from
the
political
community
as
a
spiritual
differs
from
a
secular
power
rather
it
rests
on
the
same
foundations
and
is
in
fact
the
ideal
of
the
state
isaiah
gave
this
ideal
its
classical
form
in
those
pictures
of
the
future
which
we
are
accustomed
to
call
messianic
prophecies
these
passages
are
not
predictions
of
this
or
that
occurrence
but
announcements
of
the
aims
which
it
is
true
the
prophet
only
expects
the
future
to
realise
but
which
are
of
force
or
ought
to
be
of
force
in
the
present
and
towards
which
the
community
if
true
to
its
own
nature
must
strive
the
first
feature
of
these
messianic
descriptions
is
the
expulsion
of
the
assyrians
but
most
emphasis
is
laid
on
the
restoration
of
the
inner
bases
of
the
state
the
rottenness
of
which
has
brought
about
and
rendered
inevitable
the
present
crisis
the
collapse
of
the
government
the
paralysis
fallen
on
the
law
the
spoliation
of
the
weak
by
the
strong
these
are
the
evils
that
call
for
redress
how
is
the
honourable
city
become
a
harlot
it
was
full
of
judgment
righteousness
lodged
in
it
but
now
murderers
thy
princes
are
rascals
and
companions
of
thieves
every
one
loveth
gifts
and
followeth
after
bribes
they
judge
not
the
fatherless
neither
cloth
the
cause
of
the
widow
come
unto
them
therefore
saith
the
lord
ah
i
will
ease
me
of
mine
adversaries
and
avenge
me
of
mine
enemies
and
i
will
turn
my
hand
against
thee
zion
and
as
with
iye
i
will
purge
away
thy
dross
and
i
will
restore
thy
judges
as
at
the
first
and
thy
counsellors
as
at
the
beginning
afterwards
thou
shalt
be
called
a
righteous
and
honourable
city
zion
shall
be
redeemed
by
judgment
and
her
inhabitants
by
righteousness
isaiah
i
the
state
the
prophet
has
before
his
eye
is
always
the
natural
state
as
it
exists
never
a
community
distinguished
by
a
peculiar
holiness
in
its
organisation
the
kingdom
of
jehovah
is
with
him
entirely
identical
with
the
kingdom
of
david
the
tasks
he
sets
before
it
are
political
in
their
nature
similar
we
might
say
to
the
demands
one
would
address
to
the
turkish
empire
in
our
own
days
he
is
unconscious
of
any
difference
between
human
and
divine
law
law
in
itself
jurist
law
in
the
proper
juristic
sense
of
the
word
is
divine
and
has
behind
it
the
authority
of
the
holy
one
of
israel
in
that
day
shall
jehovah
of
hosts
be
for
a
crown
of
glory
and
a
diadem
of
beauty
unto
the
residue
of
his
people
and
for
a
spirit
of
judgment
to
him
that
sitteth
in
judgment
and
a
spirit
of
strength
to
them
that
drive
back
the
battle
from
the
borders
xxviii
jehovah
is
a
true
and
perfect
king
hence
justice
is
his
principal
attribute
and
his
chief
demand
and
this
justice
is
a
purely
forensic
or
social
notion
the
righteousness
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
can
only
come
into
consideration
when
civil
justice
and
order
have
come
to
be
a
matter
of
course
which
at
that
time
they
had
not
yet
done
the
representative
of
jehovah
is
the
human
king
the
earthly
ruler
is
not
in
the
way
of
the
heavenly
even
the
glorious
kingdom
of
the
future
can
not
dispense
with
him
then
a
king
shall
reign
in
righteousness
and
princes
shall
rule
in
judgment
each
of
them
shall
be
as
an
from
the
wind
and
as
a
covert
from
the
tempest
as
rivers
of
waters
in
a
dry
place
as
the
shadow
of
a
great
rock
in
a
weary
land
xxxii
as
the
reigning
king
is
in
general
unsatisfactory
isaiah
hopes
for
a
new
one
who
will
answer
the
pattern
of
david
of
old
the
messiah
there
shall
come
forth
a
rod
out
of
the
stem
of
jesse
and
a
branch
shall
grow
out
of
his
roots
and
the
spirit
of
jehovah
shall
rest
upon
him
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
understanding
the
spirit
of
counsel
and
of
warlike
might
the
spirit
of
knowledge
and
of
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
his
breath
shall
be
drawn
in
the
fear
of
jehovah
and
he
shall
not
judge
after
the
sight
of
his
eyes
nor
decide
by
hearsay
but
with
righteousness
shall
he
judge
the
poor
and
give
sentence
with
equity
for
the
meek
of
the
earth
but
he
shall
smite
the
scorners
with
the
rod
of
his
mouth
and
with
the
breath
of
his
lips
shall
he
slay
the
wicked
so
that
righteousness
shall
be
the
girdle
of
his
loins
and
faithfulness
the
girdle
of
his
reins
then
the
wolf
shall
dwell
with
the
lamb
and
the
leopard
shall
lie
down
with
the
kid
and
the
calf
and
the
young
lion
together
and
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
and
the
cow
and
the
bear
shall
feed
their
young
ones
shall
lie
down
together
and
the
lion
shall
eat
straw
like
the
ox
and
the
sucking
child
shall
stroke
the
head
of
the
adder
and
the
weaned
child
shall
put
his
hand
on
the
of
the
basilisk
they
shall
not
hurt
nor
destroy
in
all
my
holy
mountain
xi
this
is
generally
considered
to
be
a
prediction
of
a
universal
golden
age
on
earth
but
isaiah
only
speaks
of
the
holy
mountain
as
the
scene
meaning
by
this
the
whole
city
of
david
as
the
centre
of
his
kingdom
the
just
and
strict
government
of
the
descendant
of
david
is
to
bring
it
about
that
righteousness
and
truth
kiss
each
other
and
that
the
strong
do
not
dare
to
injure
the
weak
fear
of
the
severity
of
the
law
engenders
general
confidence
the
lamb
is
no
longer
afraid
of
the
wolf
the
opposite
of
this
ideal
is
lawlessness
and
anarchy
within
not
war
without
the
hope
is
not
that
of
international
peace
as
we
see
both
from
verse
and
from
verse
the
messiah
is
adorned
just
with
the
virtues
which
befit
a
ruler
and
this
shows
sufficiently
what
is
the
nature
of
the
kingdom
of
which
he
is
to
be
the
head
what
is
the
notion
of
the
theocracy
the
other
prophets
of
this
period
agree
with
isaiah
lamentations
iv
only
hosea
is
peculiar
in
this
as
in
other
points
he
appears
to
have
regarded
the
kingdom
as
such
as
an
evil
in
more
than
one
expression
he
makes
it
the
antithesis
of
the
rule
of
jehovah
but
we
have
to
remember
that
this
judgment
of
his
is
based
entirely
on
his
historical
experience
in
the
kingdom
of
the
ten
tribes
the
supreme
power
was
constantly
being
seized
by
usurpers
so
that
instead
of
being
the
pillar
of
order
and
law
it
was
the
plaything
of
parties
and
the
occasion
of
incessant
disturbances
it
is
this
kingdom
that
hosea
has
in
view
and
he
reprobates
it
for
no
other
reason
than
that
in
the
three
hundred
years
of
its
existence
it
has
not
approved
itself
and
does
not
approve
itself
in
the
present
time
of
need
he
does
not
proceed
as
on
theory
he
does
not
apply
as
his
rule
a
pattern
of
the
theocratic
constitution
given
antecedently
to
any
historical
development
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
never
entered
his
head
that
the
form
god
desired
the
community
to
take
was
not
a
thing
to
be
determined
by
circumstances
but
had
been
revealed
at
mount
sinai
he
even
speaks
with
favour
of
david
and
the
kingdom
of
judah
but
i
consider
all
such
references
in
hosea
as
well
as
in
amos
to
be
interpolations
in
i
there
is
a
reference
to
the
deliverance
of
jerusalem
under
hezekiah
nor
did
the
theocracy
exist
from
the
time
of
moses
in
the
form
of
the
covenant
though
that
was
afterwards
a
favourite
mode
of
regarding
it
the
relation
of
jehovah
to
israel
was
in
its
nature
and
origin
a
natural
one
there
was
no
interval
between
him
and
his
people
to
call
for
thought
or
question
only
when
the
existence
of
israel
had
come
to
be
threatened
by
the
syrians
and
assyrians
did
such
prophets
as
elijah
and
amos
raise
the
deity
high
above
the
people
sever
the
natural
bond
between
them
and
put
in
its
place
a
relation
depending
on
conditions
conditions
of
a
moral
character
to
them
jehovah
was
the
god
of
righteousness
in
the
first
place
and
the
god
of
israel
in
the
second
place
and
even
that
only
so
far
as
israel
came
up
to
the
righteous
demands
which
in
his
grace
he
had
revealed
to
him
they
inverted
the
order
of
these
two
fundamental
articles
of
faith
if
your
sins
are
as
scarlet
how
should
they
be
reckoned
white
as
snow
if
they
are
red
like
crimson
how
should
they
be
as
wool
if
ye
be
willing
and
obedient
ye
shall
eat
the
good
of
the
land
but
if
ye
refuse
and
rebel
ye
must
eat
the
sword
for
the
mouth
of
jehovah
hath
spoken
it
thus
the
nature
of
the
conditions
which
jehovah
required
of
his
people
came
to
the
very
front
in
considering
his
relations
with
them
the
torah
of
jehovah
which
originally
like
all
his
dealings
fell
under
the
category
of
divine
aid
especially
in
the
doing
of
justice
of
divine
guidance
in
the
solution
of
difficult
questions
was
now
conceived
of
as
incorporating
the
demands
on
the
fulfilment
of
which
his
attitude
towards
israel
entirely
depended
in
this
way
arose
from
ideas
which
easily
suggested
it
but
yet
as
an
entirely
new
thing
the
substance
of
the
notion
of
covenant
or
treaty
the
name
berith
however
does
not
occur
in
the
old
prophets
not
even
in
hosea
who
certainly
presents
us
as
clearly
as
possible
with
the
thing
in
his
figure
of
the
marriage
of
jehovah
and
israel
isaiah
i
that
he
was
unacquainted
with
the
technical
usage
of
berith
is
strikingly
proved
by
ii
and
vi
and
these
passages
must
decide
the
view
we
take
of
viii
a
passage
which
is
probably
interpolated
the
name
berith
comes
it
is
likely
from
quite
a
different
quarter
the
ancient
hebrews
had
no
other
conception
of
law
nor
any
other
designation
for
it
than
that
of
a
treaty
a
law
only
obtained
force
by
the
fact
of
those
to
whom
it
was
given
binding
themselves
to
keep
it
so
it
is
in
exodus
xxiv
and
in
xxiii
so
also
in
jeremiah
xxxiv
curiously
enough
just
as
with
the
people
of
mecca
at
the
time
of
mohammed
lbn
hisham
hence
also
the
term
sepher
berith
for
the
deuteronomic
as
well
as
the
jehovistic
book
of
the
law
this
use
of
the
phrase
berith
treaty
for
law
fitted
very
well
with
the
great
idea
of
the
prophets
and
received
from
it
in
turn
an
interpretation
according
to
which
the
relation
of
jehovah
to
israel
was
conditioned
by
the
demands
of
his
righteousness
as
set
forth
in
his
word
and
instruction
in
this
view
of
the
matter
jehovah
and
israel
came
to
be
regarded
as
the
contracting
parties
of
the
covenant
by
which
the
various
representatives
of
the
people
had
originally
pledged
each
other
to
keep
say
the
deuteronomic
law
i
this
variation
gained
entrance
the
more
easily
as
berith
is
used
in
various
applications
of
the
capitulation
the
terms
of
which
are
imposed
by
the
stronger
on
the
weaker
party
that
the
contracting
parties
had
equal
rights
was
by
no
means
involved
in
the
notion
of
the
berith
see
the
wavering
of
the
notion
in
jeremiah
xxxiv
after
the
solemn
and
act
by
which
josiah
introduced
this
law
the
notion
of
between
jehovah
and
israel
appears
to
have
occupied
the
central
position
in
religious
thought
it
prevails
in
deuteronomy
in
jeremiah
ezekiel
in
isaiah
leviticus
and
most
of
all
in
the
book
of
the
four
covenants
the
babylonian
exile
no
doubt
helped
as
the
assyrian
exile
had
previously
done
to
familiarise
the
jewish
mind
with
the
idea
that
the
covenant
depended
on
conditions
and
might
possibly
be
dissolved
the
tabernacle
of
david
fell
at
last
and
no
king
was
born
to
set
it
up
again
the
state
suffered
not
a
crisis
but
destruction
and
the
result
was
that
such
of
the
religious
hopes
of
the
people
as
they
still
held
fast
were
no
longer
limited
to
existing
political
conditions
but
now
took
a
freer
flight
became
tinged
with
enthusiasm
and
cast
off
all
restrictions
in
former
times
there
was
always
an
enemy
threatening
in
the
background
a
danger
really
approaching
to
give
rise
to
the
expectation
of
a
great
conflagration
the
materials
for
which
had
long
been
collected
in
the
nation
itself
but
after
the
exile
fancy
dealt
in
general
coalitions
of
god
knows
what
peoples
against
the
new
jerusalem
vaticinations
for
which
there
was
no
ground
whatever
in
reality

in
isaiah
on
the
other
hand
we
must
of
course
read
gwy
for
gwym
the
singular
instead
of
the
plural
in
earlier
times
the
national
state
as
it
had
existed
under
david
was
the
goal
of
all
wishes
now
a
universal
world
empire
was
erected
in
imagination
which
was
to
lift
up
its
head
at
jerusalem
over
the
ruins
of
the
heathen
powers
prophecy
was
no
longer
tied
to
history
nor
supported
by
it
but
the
extravagant
hopes
now
built
on
jehovah
were
balanced
on
the
other
side
by
sober
and
realisable
aims
which
the
course
of
history
presented
those
who
waited
for
the
consolation
of
israel
were
then
confronted
from
the
nature
of
their
situation
with
practical
tasks
the
old
prophets
were
satisfied
with
expressing
their
ideas
with
criticising
existing
evils
as
to
practical
points
they
had
nothing
to
say
the
leadership
of
the
people
was
in
other
hands
but
the
old
community
being
now
gone
and
its
heads
having
fallen
with
it
the
godly
both
had
the
power
and
felt
the
obligation
to
place
themselves
at
the
head
of
the
israel
now
to
be
anew
created
after
which
they
had
long
been
striving
and
their
faith
in
which
was
still
unshaken
in
former
times
the
nation
had
not
been
so
seriously
threatened
as
that
its
continued
existence
notwithstanding
the
dangerous
crises
it
might
have
to
pass
through
should
ever
cease
to
be
regarded
as
natural
as
a
thing
of
course
but
now
this
was
by
no
means
a
thing
of
course
the
danger
was
a
pressing
one
that
the
jewish
exiles
like
the
samaritan
exiles
before
them
would
be
absorbed
by
the
heathens
among
whom
they
dwelt
in
that
case
the
messianic
hopes
also
would
have
lost
their
point
of
application
for
however
true
it
was
that
the
realising
of
them
was
jehovah
concern
the
men
must
still
be
there
to
whom
they
were
to
be
fulfilled
thus
everything
depended
on
getting
the
sacred
remnant
safe
across
this
danger
and
giving
it
so
solid
an
organisation
that
it
might
survive
the
storms
and
keep
alive
the
expectation
of
the
promise
but
in
the
eyes
of
those
whose
words
had
weight
in
the
restoration
the
old
community
as
it
had
existed
formerly
was
not
in
good
repute
they
could
not
but
allow
jehovah
sentence
of
condemnation
to
be
just
which
he
had
spoken
by
the
mouth
of
his
servants
and
through
the
voice
of
history
the
utterances
of
the
prophets
that
fortresses
and
horses
and
men
of
war
that
kings
and
princes
can
not
help
were
called
to
mind
and
turned
into
practical
principles
the
sole
rule
of
jehovah
was
to
be
carried
out
in
earnest
circumstances
favoured
the
design
and
this
was
the
great
point
as
matters
then
were
the
reconstitution
of
an
actual
state
was
not
to
be
thought
of
the
foreign
rule
would
not
admit
of
it

what
plan
was
to
be
taken
what
materials
to
be
used
for
such
a
building
as
the
times
allowed
the
prophetic
ideas
would
not
serve
as
building
stones
they
were
not
sufficiently
practical
then
appeared
the
importance
of
institutions
of
traditional
forms
for
the
conservation
even
of
the
spiritual
side
of
the
religion
the
jewish
royal
temple
had
early
overshadowed
the
other
sanctuaries
and
in
the
course
of
the
seventh
century
they
were
extinct
or
verging
on
extinction
under
the
shelter
of
the
monarchy
the
priests
of
jerusalem
had
grown
great
and
had
at
last
attained
as
against
their
professional
brethren
elsewhere
a
position
of
exclusive
legitimacy
the
weaker
the
state
grew
the
deeper
it
sank
from
the
fall
of
josiah
onwards
the
higher
became
the
prestige
of
the
temple
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
and
the
greater
and
the
more
independent
grew
the
power
of
its
numerous
priesthood
how
much
more
do
we
feel
it
in
jeremiah
time
than
in
that
of
isaiah
this
advance
of
the
priesthood
indicates
unmistakably
the
rise
into
prominence
of
the
cultus
in
the
seventh
century
a
rise
rather
helped
than
hindered
by
the
long
reign
of
manasseh
evil
as
is
the
reputation
of
that
reign
it
shows
itself
not
only
in
the
introduction
of
more
luxurious
materials
incense
for
example
but
even
more
in
the
importance
given
to
great
and
striking
services
the
sacrifice
of
children
and
the
expiatory
offering
even
after
the
abolition
of
the
horrid
atrocities
of
manasseh
time
the
bloody
earnestness
remained
behind
with
which
the
performance
of
divine
service
was
gone
about
so
closely
was
the
cultus
of
jerusalem
interwoven
with
the
consciousness
of
the
jewish
people
and
so
strongly
had
the
priesthood
established
their
order
that
after
the
collapse
of
the
kingdom
the
elements
still
survived
here
for
the
new
formation
of
a
congregation
answering
to
the
circumstances
and
needs
of
the
time
around
the
ruined
sanctuary
the
community

more
lifted
up

the
usages
and
ordinances
were
though
everywhere
changes
in
detail
yet
not
created
afresh
whatever
creating
there
was
lay
in
this
that
these
usages
were
bound
together
in
a
system
and
made
the
instruments
of
restoring
an
organisation
of
the
remnant
ezekiel
first
pointed
out
the
way
which
was
suited
for
the
time
he
is
the
connecting
link
between
the
prophets
and
the
law
he
claims
to
be
a
prophet
and
starts
from
prophetic
ideas
but
they
are
not
his
own
ideas
they
are
those
of
his
predecessors
which
he
turns
into
dogmas
he
is
by
nature
a
priest
and
his
peculiar
merit
is
that
he
enclosed
the
soul
of
prophecy
in
the
body
of
a
community
which
was
not
political
but
founded
on
the
temple
and
the
cultus
the
chapters
are
the
most
important
in
his
book
and
have
been
called
by
orth
not
incorrectly
the
key
of
the
old
testament
thus
arose
that
artificial
product
the
sacred
constitution
of
judaism
in
the
priestly
code
we
have
the
picture
of
it
in
detail
it
is
not
the
case
that
the
hierocracy
is
based
on
the
priestly
code
that
code
was
only
introduced
after
the
hierocracy
was
already
in
existence
but
helped
no
doubt
to
consolidate
and
legalise
it
the
written
law
afterwards
undermined
the
rule
of
the
priests
and
the
scriptures
played
into
the
hands
of
the
scribes
and
pharisees
compare
the
case
of
the
parsees
and
sabians
and
the
reference
given
here
namely

in
error
there
is
no
note
on
and
i
do
not
know
what
is
being
referred
to
the
distinction
drawn
with
such
pains
between
the
mosaic
theocracy
and
the
hierocracy
is
too
fine
theocracy
as
a
constitution
is
hierocracy
if
moses
founded
such
a
constitution
he
did
it
prophetically
with
a
view
to
circumstances
which
only
arose
a
thousand
years
after
his
day
old
israel
had
not
shrunk
to
a
religious
congregation
public
life
was
not
quite
absorbed
in
the
service
of
the
sanctuary
the
high
priest
and
the
dwelling
of
jehovah
were
not
the
centre
round
which
all
revolved
is
not
correct
these
great
changes
were
wrought
by
the
destruction
of
the
political
existence
first
of
samaria
then
of
judah
in
this
way
the
people
became
a
kingdom
of
priests
and
a
holy
nation
as
we
read
in
a
deuteronomistic
passage
exodus
xix
if
the
divine
rule
was
formerly
a
belief
supporting
the
natural
ordinances
of
human
society
it
was
now
set
forth
in
visible
form
as
a
divine
state
in
an
artificial
sphere
peculiar
to
itself
and
transcending
the
ordinary
life
of
the
people
the
idea
had
formerly
informed
and
possessed
the
natural
body
but
now
in
order
that
it
might
be
thoroughly
realised
it
was
to
have
spiritual
body
of
its
own
there
arose
a
material
external
antithesis
of
a
sacred
and
profane
men
minds
came
to
be
full
of
this
and
it
was
their
great
endeavour
to
draw
the
line
as
sharply
as
possible
and
to
repress
the
natural
sphere
more
and
more
holiness
is
the
ruling
idea
in
ezekiel
in
leviticus
and
in
the
priestly
code
the
notion
is
a
somewhat
empty
one
expressing
rather
what
a
thing
is
not
than
what
it
is
at
first
it
meant
the
same
as
divine
but
now
it
is
used
mainly
in
the
sense
of
spiritual
priestly
as
if
the
divine
could
be
distinguished
from
the
worldly
the
natural
by
outward
visible
marks
of
that
kind
the
mosaic
theocracy
the
residuum
of
a
ruined
state
is
itself
not
a
state
at
all
but
an
unpolitical
artificial
product
created
in
spite
of
unfavourable
circumstances
by
the
impulse
of
an
energy
and
foreign
rule
is
its
necessary
counterpart
in
its
nature
it
is
intimately
allied
to
the
old
catholic
church
which
was
in
fact
its
child
as
a
matter
of
taste
it
may
be
objectionable
to
speak
of
the
jewish
church
but
as
a
matter
of
history
it
is
not
inaccurate
and
the
name
is
perhaps
preferable
to
that
of
theocracy
which
shelters
such
confusion
of
ideas
the
mosaic
theocracy
appears
to
show
an
immense
retrogression
the
law
of
jehovah
should
denote
what
is
characteristic
of
his
people
over
against
the
heathen
but
this
certainly
did
not
consist
in
the
cultus
of
israel
it
would
be
vain
labour
to
seek
in
this
and
that
slight
variation
between
the
hebrew
and
the
greek
ritual
a
difference
of
principle
between
them
the
cultus
is
the
heathen
element
in
the
israelite
religion
the
word
heathen
not
being
understood
of
course
in
an
ignoble
or
unworthy
sense
if
the
priestly
code
makes
the
cultus
the
principal
thing
that
appears
to
amount
to
a
systematic
decline
into
the
heathenism
which
the
prophets
incessantly
combated
and
yet
were
unable
to
eradicate
it
will
be
readily
acknowledged
that
at
the
constitution
of
the
new
jerusalem
the
prophetic
impulses
were
deflected
by
a
previously
existing
natural
tendency
of
the
mass
on
which
they
had
to
operate
yet
in
every
part
of
the
legal
worship
we
see
the
most
decided
traces
of
their
influence
we
have
seen
to
what
a
large
extent
that
worship
is
everywhere
marked
by
a
centralising
tendency
this
tendency
is
not
connected
in
the
priestly
code
with
opposition
to
improper
or
foreign
worship
yet
it
must
be
interpreted
as
a
polemical
measure
and
if
it
be
regarded
as
an
axiom
necessary
in
the
priestly
code
from
the
nature
of
the
case
that
is
only
saving
that
the
demands
of
the
prophets
had
prevailed
most
completely
in
a
field
where
they
had
the
greatest
obstacles
to
contend
with
exclusive
monolatry
is
by
no
means
innate
in
the
cultus
it
can
only
be
deduced
from
considerations
which
are
foreign
to
the
nature
of
the
cultus
it
is
the
antitype
of
strict
monotheism
the
prohibition
of
images
too
in
the
worship
of
the
deity
is
not
expressly
insisted
on
as
in
deuteronomy
but
is
a
provision
which
is
taken
for
granted
so
little
is
this
position
in
danger
of
question
that
even
doubtful
and
repugnant
elements
are
embodied
in
the
worship
and
assimilated
by
it
without
hesitation
the
golden
ephod
denounced
by
isaiah
has
become
an
insignificant
decoration
of
the
talismans
forbidden
even
by
ezekiel
are
allowed
numbers
xv
but
the
object
of
them
is
that
ye
may
look
upon
them
and
remember
all
the
commandments
of
jehovah
and
do
them
and
that
ye
follow
not
after
your
own
heart
and
your
own
eyes
after
which
ye
used
to
go
a
whoring
the
gross
idolatry
with
which
the
expression
znh
is
always
connected
in
other
passages
is
by
this
time
out
of
the
question
the
heart
itself
with
its
lawless
motions
is
the
strange
god
whose
service
is
forbidden
we
may
go
further
and
say
that
by
the
the
cultus
is
estranged
from
its
own
nature
and
overthrown
in
its
own
sphere
that
is
most
unmistakably
the
case
with
regard
to
the
festivals
they
have
lost
their
reference
to
harvest
and
cattle
and
have
become
historical
commemorations
they
deny
their
birth
from
nature
and
celebrate
the
institution
of
supernatural
religion
and
the
gracious
acts
of
jehovah
therewith
connected
the
broadly
human
the
indigenous
element
falls
away
they
receive
a
statutory
character
and
a
significance
limited
to
israel
they
no
longer
draw
down
the
deity
into
human
life
on
all
important
occasions
to
take
part
in
its
joys
and
its
necessities
they
are
not
human
attempts
with
such
naive
means
as
are
at
command
to
please
the
deity
and
render
him
favourable
they
are
removed
from
the
natural
sphere
and
made
divine
means
of
grace
which
jehovah
has
instituted
in
israel
as
sacraments
of
the
theocracy
the
worshipper
no
longer
thinks
that
in
his
gift
he
is
doing
god
a
pleasure
providing
him
with
an
enjoyment
what
pleases
him
and
is
effectual
is
only
the
strict
observance
of
the
rite
the
sacrifices
must
be
offered
exactly
according
to
prescription
at
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
by
the
right
individuals
in
the
right
way
they
are
not
based
on
the
inner
value
of
what
is
done
on
the
impulse
arising
out
of
fresh
occasions
but
on
the
positive
command
of
a
will
outside
the
worshipper
which
is
not
explained
and
which
prescribes
every
particular
the
bond
between
cultus
and
sensuality
is
severed
no
danger
can
arise
of
an
admixture
of
impure
immoral
elements
a
danger
which
was
always
present
in
hebrew
antiquity
worship
no
longer
springs
from
an
inner
impulse
it
has
come
to
be
an
exercise
of
religiosity
it
has
no
natural
significance
its
significance
is
transcendental
incomparable
not
to
be
defined
the
chief
effect
of
it
which
is
always
produced
with
certainty
is
atonement
for
after
the
exile
the
consciousness
of
sin
called
forth
by
the
rejection
of
the
people
from
the
face
of
jehovah
was
to
a
certain
extent
permanent
even
when
the
hard
service
of
israel
was
accomplished
and
the
wrath
really
blown
over
it
would
not
disappear
if
then
the
value
of
the
sacred
offerings
lay
not
in
themselves
but
in
obedience
to
the
commandments
of
god
the
centre
of
gravity
of
the
cultus
was
removed
from
that
exercise
itself
and
transferred
to
another
field
that
of
morality
the
consequence
was
that
sacrifices
and
gifts
gave
way
to
ascetic
exerctses
which
were
more
strictly
and
more
simply
connected
with
morality
precepts
given
originally
in
reference
to
the
consecration
of
the
priests
for
their
religious
functions
were
extended
to
the
laity
the
observance
of
these
laws
of
physical
cleanliness
was
of
much
more
radical
importance
in
judaism
than
the
great
public
cultus
and
led
by
the
straightest
road
towards
the
theocratic
ideal
of
holiness
and
of
universal
priesthood
the
whole
of
life
was
compressed
into
a
certain
holy
path
there
was
always
a
divine
command
to
be
fulfilled
and
by
thinking
of
it
a
man
kept
himself
from
following
after
the
desires
and
lusts
of
his
own
heart
on
the
other
hand
this
private
cultus
which
constantly
required
attention
kept
alive
and
active
the
individual
sense
of
sin
the
great
pathologist
of
judaism
is
quite
right
in
the
mosaic
theocracy
the
cultus
became
a
pedagogic
instrument
of
discipline
it
is
estranged
from
the
heart
its
revival
was
due
to
old
custom
it
would
never
have
blossomed
again
of
itself
it
no
longer
has
its
roots
in
childlike
impulse
it
is
a
dead
work
in
spite
of
all
the
importance
attached
to
it
nay
just
because
of
the
anxious
conscientiousness
with
which
it
was
gone
about
at
the
restoration
of
judaism
the
old
usages
were
patched
together
in
a
new
system
which
however
only
served
as
the
form
to
preserve
something
that
was
nobler
in
its
nature
but
could
not
have
been
saved
otherwise
than
in
a
narrow
shell
that
stoutly
resisted
all
foreign
influences
that
heathenism
in
israel
against
which
the
prophets
vainly
protested
was
inwardly
overcome
by
the
law
on
its
own
ground
and
the
cultus
after
nature
had
been
killed
in
it
became
the
shield
of
supernaturalistic
monotheism

ancient
seat
in
the
extreme
south
of

occupy
the
not

of
egypt
goshen
where
they
carried
on
their
old
calling
that
of
shepherds
and
goatherds
although
settled
within
the
territory
of
the
pharaohs
and
recognising
their
authority
they
continued
to
retain
all
their
old
characteristics
their
language
their
patriarchal
institutions
their
nomad
habits
of
life
but
in
course
of
time
these
foreign
guests
were
subjected
to
changed
treatment
forced
labour
was
exacted
of
them
for
the
construction
of
new
public
works
in
goshen
an
exaction
which
was
felt
to
be
an
assault
upon
their
freedom
and
honour
and
which
in
point
of
fact
was
fitted
to
take
away
all
that
was
distinctive
of
their
nationality
but
they
had
no
remedy
at
hand
and
had
submitted
in
despair
until
moses
at
last
saw
a
favourable
opportunity
of
deliverance
reminding
his
oppressed
brethren
of
the
god
of
their
fathers
and
urging
that
their
cause
was
his
he
taught
them
to
regard
against
the
egyptians
as
an
article
of
religion
and
they
became
once
more
a
united
people
in
a
determination
to
seek
refuge
from
oppression
in
the
wilderness
which
was
the
of
their
kindred
and
the
seat
of
their
god
at
a
time
when
egypt
was
scourged
by
a
grievous
plague
the
hebrews
broke
up
their
settlement
in
goshen
one
night
in
spring
and
directed
their
steps
towards
their
old
home
again
according
to
the
accounts
the
king
had
consented
to
the
exodus
and
latterly
had
even
forced
it
on
but
it
was
none
the
less
a
secret
flight
to
a
not
very
numerous
pastoral
people
such
an
undertaking
presented
no
great
difficulty
nevertheless
its
execution
was
not
to
be
carried
out
unimpeded
the
hebrews

the
situation
was
a
critical
one
but
a
high

during
the
night
left
the
shallow
sea
so
low
that
it
became

moses
eagerly
accepted
the
suggestion
and
made
the
venture
with
success
the
egyptians
rushing
after
came
up
with
them
on
the
further
shore
and
a
struggle
ensued
but
the
assailants
fought
at

disadvantage

before

end
of

these
figures
are
systematic
or
at

systematised
but
even
so
they
are
certainly
more
trustworthy
than
the
combinations
of
the
egyptologists

where
they
remained
for

years

at
the
well
of

their
sanctuary
and
only
while
with
their
flocks
they
ranged
over
an
extensive
tract
in
all
probability
their
stay
at
kadesh
was
no
involuntary
detention
rather
was
it
this
locality
they
had
more
immediately
had
in
view
in
setting
out
for
a
civilised
community
of
from
two
to
three
millions
such
a
settlement
would
of
course
have
been
impossible
but
it
was
quite
sufficient
for
the
immediate
requirements
of
the
goshen
shepherds
few
in
number
as
they
were
and
inured
to
the
life
of
the
desert
that
attempts
may
have
been
made
by
them
to
obtain
possession
of
the
more
fertile
country
to
the
north
is
very
likely
but
that
from
the
outset
they
contemplated
the
conquest
of
the
whole
of
palestine
proper
and
that
it
was
only
in
expiation
of
a
fault
that
they
were
held
back
at
the
gate
of
the
promised
land
until
the
whole
generation
of
the
disobedient
had
died
out
is
not
historically
probable
we
can
assign
a
definite
reason
for
their
final
departure
from
kadesh
in
the
district
to
the
east
of
jordan
the
canaanite
amorites
had
sometime
previously
driven
the
ammonites
from
the
lower
jabbok
and
deprived
the
moabites
of
all
their
territory
to
the
north
of

arnon
on
the
plateau
opposite
jericho
heshbon
had
become
the
capital
of
sihon
the
amorite
king
this
sovereign
now
set
himself
to
subdue

and
not
without
success

of

of

upon

of

woe
to
thee
o
moab
thou
art
undone
o
people
of
chemosh
from
these
straits
the
moabites
were
rescued
by
their
cousins
the
nomads
of
the
wilderness
of
kadesh
the
israelites
came
forward
on
behalf
of
what
was
at
once
the
common
hebrew
cause
and
their
own
particular
interest
they
took
the
field
against
the
amorites
vanquished
them
in
battle
and
broke
up
the
kingdom
of
sihon
the
consequence
was
that
the
land
to
the
south
of
the
arnon
remained
in
the
undisputed
possession
of
moab
while
the
victors
themselves
became
masters
of
the
territory
immediately
to
the
north
settled
thus
between
moab
and
ammon
their
kinsmen
the
israelites
supplied
the
link
that
was
wanting
in
the
chain
of
petty
hebrew
nationalities
established
in
the
south
of
eastern
palestine
the
army
that
went
out
against
the
amorites
from
kadesh
was
certainly
not
exclusively
composed
of
men
who
or
whose
fathers
had
accomplished
the
passage
of
the
red
sea
israel
was
not
a
formed
nation
when
it
left
egypt
and
throughout
the
whole
period
of
its
sojourn
in
the
wilderness
it
continued
to
be
in
process
of
growth
instead
of
excluding
the
kindred
elements
which
offered
themselves
to
it
on
its
new
soil
it
received
and
assimilated
them
the
life
they
had
lived
together
under
moses
had
been
the
first
thing
to
awaken
a
feeling
of
solidarity
among
the
tribes
which
afterwards
constituted
the
nation
whether
they
had
previously
been
a
unity
in
any
sense
of
the
word
is
doubtful
on
the
other
hand
the
basis
of
the
unification
of
the
tribes
must
certainly
have
been
laid
before
the
conquest
of
palestine
proper
for
with
that
it
broke
up
though
the
memory
of
it
continued
at
the
same
time
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
all
the
twelve
tribes
already
existed
side
be
side
in
kadesh
the
sons
of
the
concubines
of
jacob
dan
and
naphtali
gad
and
asher
manifestly
do
not
pertain
to
israel
in
the
same
sense
as
do
those
of
leah
and
rachel
probably
they
were
late
arrivals
and
of
very
mixed
origin
we
know
besides
that
benjamin
was
not
born
until
afterwards
in
palestine
if
this
view
be
correct
israel
at
first
consisted
of
seven
tribes
of
which
one
only
that
of
joseph
traced
its
descent
to
rachel
though
in
point
of
numbers
and
physical
strength
it
was
the
equal
of
all
the
others
together
while
in
intellectual
force
it
surpassed
them
the
remaining
six
were
the
sons
of
leah
reuben
simeon
levi
judah
issachar
zebulon
they
are
always
enumerated
in
this
order
the
fact
that
the
last
two
are
also
invariably
mentioned
apart
from
the
rest
and
after
joseph
has
its
explanation
in
geographical
considerations
the
time
of
moses
is
invariably
regarded
as
the
properly
creative
period
in
israel
history
and
on
that
account
also
as
giving
the
pattern
and
norm
for
the
ages
which
followed
in
point
of
fact
the
history
of
israel
must
be
held
to
have
begun
then
and
the
foundations
of
a
new
epoch
to
have
been
laid
the
prophets
who
came
after
gave
it
is
true
greater
distinctness
to
the
peculiar
character
of
the
nation
but
they
did
not
make
it
on
the
contrary
it
made
them
again
it
is
true
that
the
movement
which
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
the
monarchy
brought
together
for
the
first
time
into
organic
unity
the
elements
which
previously
had
existed
only
in
an
isolated
condition
but
israel
sense
of
national
personality
was
a
thing
of
much
earlier
origin
which
even
in
the
time
of
the
judges
bound
the
various
tribes
and
families
together
and
must
have
had
a
great
hold
on
the
mind
of
the
nation
although
there
was
no
formal
and
binding
constitution
to
give
it
support
when
the
israelites
settled
in
palestine
they
found
it
inhabited
by
a
population
superior
to
themselves
both
in
numbers
and
in
civilisation
which
they
did
not
extirpate
but
on
the
contrary
gradually
subdued
and
absorbed
the
process
was
favoured
by
affinity
of
race
and
similarity
of
speech
but
however
far
it
went
it
never
had
the
effect
of
making
israelites
canaanites
on
the
contrary
it
made
canaanites
israelites
notwithstanding
their
inferiority
numerical
and
otherwise
they
maintained
their
individuality
and
that
without
the
support
of
any
external
organisation
thus
a
certain
inner
unity
actually
subsisted
long
before
it
had
found
any
outward
political
expression
it
goes
back
to
the
time
of
moses
who
is
to
be
regarded
as
its
author
the
foundation
upon
which
at
all
periods
israel
sense
of
its
national
unity
rested
was
religious
in
its
character
it
was
the
faith
which
may
be
summed
up
in
the
formula
jehovah
is
the
god
of
israel
and
israel
is
the
people
of
jehovah
moses
was
not
the
first
discoverer
of
this
faith
but
it
was
through
him
that
it
came
to
be
the
fundamental
basis
of
the
national
existence
and
history
jehovah
is
to
be
regarded
as
having
originally
been
a
family
or
tribal
god
either
of
the
family
to
which
moses
belonged
or
of
the
tribe
of
joseph
in
the
possession
of
which
we
find
the
ark
of
jehovah
and
within
which
occurs
the
earliest
certain
instance
of
a
composite
proper
name
with
the
word
jehovah
for
one
of
its
elements
joshua
no
essential
distinction
was
felt
to
exist
between
jehovah
and
el
any
more
than
between
asshur
and
el
jehovah
was
only
a
special
name
of
el
which
had
become
current
within
a
powerful
circle
and
which
on
that
account
was
all
the
more
fitted
to
become
the
designation
of
a
national
god
the
exigencies
of
their
position
severe
a
number
of
kindred
clans
from
their
customary
surroundings
and
drove
them
into
his
arms
he
undertook
the
responsibilities
of
their
leader
and
the
confidence
of
success
which
he
manifested
was
justified
by
the
result
but
it
was
not
through
any
merit
of
his
that
the
undertaking
of
which
he
was
the
soul
prospered
as
it
did
his
design
was
aided
in
a
wholly
way
by
a
marvellous
occurrence
quite
beyond
his
control
and
which
no
sagacity
could
possibly
have
foreseen
one
whom
the
wind
and
sea
obeyed
had
given
him
his
aid
behind
him
stood
one
higher
than
he
whose
spirit
wrought
in
him
and
whose
arm
wrought
for
him
not
for
his
personal
aggrandisement
indeed
but
for
the
weal
of
the
nation
it
was
jehovah
alike
what
was
done
by
the
deliberate
purpose
of
moses
and
what
was
done
without
any
human
contrivance
by
nature
and
by
accident
came
to
be
regarded
in
one
great
totality
as
the
doing
of
jehovah
for
israel
jehovah
it
was
who
had
directed
each
step
in
that
process
through
which
these
so
diverse
elements
brought
together
by
the
pressure
of
necessity
had
been
caused
to
pass
and
in
the
course
of
which
the
first
beginnings
of
a
feeling
of
national
unity
had
been
made
to
grow
this
feeling
moses
was
the
first
to
elicit
he
it
was
also
who
maintained
it
in
life
and
cherished
its
growth
the
extraordinary
set
of
circumstances
which
had
first
occasioned
the
new
national
movement
continued
to
subsist
though
in
a
less
degree
throughout
the
sojourn
of
the
people
in
the
wilderness
and
it
was
under
their
pressure
that
israel
continued
to
be
moulded
to
moses
who
had
been
the
means
of
so
brilliantly
helping
out
of
their
first
straits
the
hebrews
who
had
accompanied
him
out
of
egypt
they
naturally
turned
in
all
subsequent
difficulties
before
him
they
brought
all
affairs
with
which
they
were
not
themselves
able
to
cope
the
authority
which
his
antecedents
had
secured
for
him
made
him
as
matter
of
course
the
great
national
kadhi
in
the
wilderness
equally
as
matter
of
course
did
he
exercise
his
judicial
functions
neither
in
his
own
interest
nor
in
his
own
name
but
in
the
interest
of
the
whole
community
and
in
the
name
of
jehovah
by
connecting
them
with
the
sanctuary
of
jehovah
which
stood
at
the
well
of
kadesh
he
made
these
functions
independent
of
his
person
and
thus
he
laid
a
firm
basis
for
a
consuetudinary
law
and
became
the
originator
of
the
torah
in
israel
in
doing
this
he
succeeded
in
inspiring
the
national
being
with
that
which
was
the
very
life
of
his
own
soul
through
the
torah
he
gave
a
definite
positive
expression
to
their
sense
of
nationality
and
their
idea
of
god
jehovah
was
not
merely
the
god
of
israel
as
such
he
was
the
god
at
once
of
law
and
of
justice
the
basis
the
informing
principle
and
the
implied
postulate
of
their
national
consciousness
the
relationship
was
carried
on
in
precisely
the
same
manner
as
that
in
which
it
had
been
begun
it
was
most
especially
in
the
graver
moments
of
its
history
that
israel
awoke
to
full
consciousness
of
itself
and
of
jehovah
now
at
that
time
and
for
centuries
afterwards
the
highwater
marks
of
history
were
indicated
by
the
wars
it
recorded
the
name
israel
means
el
does
battle
and
jehovah
was
the
warrior
el
after
whom
the
nation
styled
itself
the
camp
was
so
to
speak
at
once
the
cradle
in
which
the
nation
was
nursed
and
the
smithy
in
which
it
was
welded
into
unity
it
was
also
the
primitive
sanctuary
there
israel
was
and
there
was
jehovah
if
in
times
of
peace
the
relations
between
the
two
had
become
dormant
they
were
at
once
called
forth
into
fullest
activity
when
the
alarm
of
danger
was
raised
israel
awakening
was
always
preceded
by
the
awakening
of
jehovah
jehovah
awakened
men
who
under
the
guidance
of
his
spirit
placed
themselves
at
the
nation
head
in
them
his
proper
leadership
was
visibly
expressed
jehovah
went
forth
with
the
host
to
battle
and
in
its
enthusiasm
his
presence
was
seen
judges
with
signs
and
wonders
from
heaven
jehovah
decided
the
struggle
carried
on
upon
earth
in
it
he
was
always
upon
israel
side
on
israel
was
his
whole
interest
concentrated
although
his
power
for
he
was
god
reached
far
beyond
their
local
limits
thus
jehovah
was
in
a
very
real
sense
a
living
god
but
the
manifestations
of
his
life
in
the
great
crises
of
his
history
were
of
necessity
separated
by
considerable
intervals
of
time
his
activity
had
something
abrupt
and
tumultuary
about
it
better
suited
for
extraordinary
occasions
than
for
ordinary
daily
life
traces
of
this
feeling
appear
very
prominently
in
the
later
stages
of
the
development
but
although
the
relations
between
israel
and
israel
god
came
most
strongly
into
prominence
in
times
of
excitement
yet
it
did
not
altogether
die
out
in
the
periods
of
comparative
repose
it
was
in
the
case
of
jehovah
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
human
leaders
of
the
people
who
did
not
in
times
of
peace
wholly
lose
the
influence
they
had
gained
in
war
jehovah
had
his
permanent
court
at
the
places
of
worship
where
in
times
of
quietude
men
clung
to
him
that
they
might
not
lose
him
in
times
of
trouble
his
chief
perhaps
in
the
time
of
moses
his
only
sanctuary
was
with
the
ark
of
the
covenant
it
was
a
standard
adapted
primarily
to
the
requirements
of
a
wandering
and
warlike
life
brought
back
from
the
field
it
became
as
symbol
of
jehovah
presence
the
central
seat
of
his
worship
the
cultus
itself
was
more
than
a
mere
paying
of
court
to
jehovah
more
than
a
mere
expedient
for
retaining
his
sympathies
against
times
of
necessity
the
torah
of
jehovah
the
holy
administration
of
law
was
conjoined
with
it
this
had
first
of
all
been
exercised
at
the
instance
of
the
priest
of
midian
by
moses
at
the
well
of
kadesh
it
was
continued
after
him
at
the
sanctuary
within
the
circle
of
those
who
had
attached
themselves
to
him
and
were
spiritually
his
heirs
in
cases
where
the
wisdom
or
the
competency
of
the
ordinary
judges
failed
men
turned
direct
to
the
godhead
to
the
sanctuary
and
those
who
served
it
their
decisions
whether
given
according
to
their
own
lights
or
by
lot
according
to
the
character
of
the
question
were
not
derived
from
any
law
but
were
received
direct
from
jehovah
they
were
consulted
chiefly
on
points
of
law
but
also
on
all
sorts
of
difficulties
as
to
what
was
right
and
to
be
done
or
wrong
and
to
be
avoided
the
execution
of
their
decisions
did
not
lie
with
them
they
could
only
advise
and
teach
their
authority
was
divine
or
as
we
should
say
moral
in
its
character
it
rested
upon
that
spontaneous
recognition
of
the
idea
of
right
which
though
unexpressed
was
alive
and
working
among
the
tribes
upon
jehovah
himself
who
was
the
author
of
this
generally
diffused
sense
of
right
but
revealed
the
proper
determinations
on
points
of
detail
only
to
certain
individuals
the
priestly
torah
was
an
entirely
unpolitical
or
rather
prepolitical
institution
it
had
an
existence
before
the
state
had
and
it
was
one
of
the
invisible
foundation
pillars
on
which
the
state
rested
war
and
the
administration
of
justice
were
regarded
as
matters
of
religion
before
they
became
matters
of
obligation
and
civil
order
this
is
all
that
is
really
meant
when
a
theocracy
is
spoken
of
moses
certainly
organised
no
formal
state
endowed
with
specific
holiness
upon
the
basis
of
the
proposition
jehovah
is
the
god
of
israel
or
at
all
events
if
he
did
so
the
fact
had
not
in
the
slightest
degree
any
practical
consequence
or
historical
significance
the
old
patriarchal
system
of
families
and
clans
continued
as
before
to
be
the
ordinary
constitution
if
one
can
apply
such
a
word
as
constitution
at
all
to
an
unorganised
conglomeration
of
homogeneous
elements
what
there
was
of
permanent
official
authority
lay
in
the
hands
of
the
elders
and
heads
of
houses
in
time
of
war
they
commanded
each
his
own
household
force
and
in
peace
they
dispensed
justice
each
within
his
own
circle
but
this
obviously
imperfect
and
inefficient
form
of
government
showed
a
growing
tendency
to
break
down
just
in
proportion
to
the
magnitude
of
the
tasks
which
the
nation
in
the
course
of
its
history
was
called
upon
to
undertake
appeal
to
jehovah
was
always
in
these
circumstances
resorted
to
his
court
was
properly
that
of
last
resort
but
the
ordinary
authorities
were
so
inadequate
that
it
had
often
enough
to
be
applied
to
theocracy
if
one
may
so
say
arose
as
the
complement
of
anarchy
actual
and
legal
existence
in
the
modern
sense
was
predicable
only
of
each
of
the
many
clans
the
unity
of
the
nation
was
realised
in
the
first
instance
only
through
its
religion
it
was
out
of
the
religion
of
israel
that
the
commonwealth
of
israel
unfolded
itself
not
a
holy
state
but
the
state
and
the
state
continued
to
be
consciously
rooted
in
religion
which
prevented
it
from
quitting
or
losing
its
rapport
with
the
soil
from
which
it
had
originally
sprung
with
the
intermediate
and
higher
stages
of
political
organisation
with
the
building
of
the
upper
structure
however
religion
had
no
concern
they
were
too
far
removed
from
the
foundation
the
derivative
which
did
not
carry
immediately
in
itself
its
own
title
to
exist
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
it
what
had
come
into
being
it
suffered
to
go
its
own
way
as
soon
as
it
was
capable
of
asserting
its
independence
for
this
reason
it
always
turned
by
preference
to
the
future
not
in
a
utopian
but
in
a
thoroughly
practical
way
by
a
single
step
only
did
it
keep
ahead
of
the
present
it
prepared
the
way
for
such
developments
as
are
not
derived
from
existing
institutions
but
spring
immediately
from
the
depths
in
which
human
society
has
its
secret
and
mysterious
roots
the
expression
jehovah
is
the
god
of
israel
accordingly
meant
that
every
tosk
of
the
nation
internal
as
well
as
external
was
conceived
as
holy
it
certainly
did
not
mean
that
the
almighty
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
was
conceived
of
as
having
first
made
a
covenant
with
this
one
people
that
by
them
he
might
be
truly
known
and
worshipped
it
was
not
as
if
jehovah
had
originally
been
regarded
as
the
god
of
the
universe
who
subsequently
became
the
god
of
israel
on
the
contrary
he
was
primarily
god
and
only
afterwards
very
long
afterwards
did
he
come
to
be
regarded
as
the
god
of
the
universe
for
moses
to
have
given
to
the
israelites
an
enlightened
conception
of
god
would
have
been
to
have
given
them
a
stone
instead
of
bread
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
probable
that
with
regard
to
the
essential
nature
of
jehovah
as
distinct
from
his
relation
to
men
he
allowed
them
to
continue
in
the
same
way
of
thinking
with
their
fathers
with
theoretical
truths
which
were
not
at
all
in
demand
he
did
not
occupy
himself
but
purely
with
practical
questions
which
were
put
and
urged
by
the
pressure
of
the
times
the
religious
of
the
history
of
israel
was
remarkable
not
for
its
novelty
but
for
its
normal
character
in
all
ancient
primitive
peoples
the
relation
in
which
god
is
conceived
to
stand
to
the
circumstances
of
the
nation
in
other
words
religion
furnishes
a
motive
for
law
and
morals
in
the
case
of
none
did
it
become
so
with
such
purity
and
power
as
in
that
of
the
israelites
whatever
jehovah
may
have
been
conceived
to
be
in
his
essential
of
the
thunderstorm
or
the
like
this
fell
more
and
more
into
the
background
as
mysterious
and
transcendental
the
subject
was
not
one
for
inquiry
all
stress
was
laid
upon
his
activity
within
the
world
of
mankind
whose
ends
he
made
one
with
his
own
religion
thus
did
not
make
men
partakers
in
a
divine
life
but
contrariwise
it
made
god
a
partaker
in
the
life
of
men
life
in
this
way
was
not
straitened
by
it
but
enlarged
the
particularism
of
israel
idea
of
god
was
in
fact
the
real
strength
of
israel
religion
it
thus
escaped
from
barren
mythologisings
and
became
free
to
apply
itself
to
the
moral
tasks
which
are
always
given
and
admit
of
being
discharged
only
in
definite
spheres
as
god
of
the
nation
jehovah
became
the
god
of
justice
and
of
right
as
god
of
justice
and
right
he
came
to
be
thought
of
as
the
highest
and
at
last
as
the
only
power
in
heaven
and
earth
in
the
preceding
sketch
the
attempt
has
been
made
to
exhibit
mosaism
as
it
must
be
supposed
to
have
existed
on
the
assumption
that
the
history
of
israel
commenced
with
it
and
that
for
centuries
it
continued
to
be
the
ideal
root
out
of
which
that
history
continued
to
grow
this
being
assumed
we
can
not
treat
the
legislative
portion
of
the
pentateuch
as
a
source
from
which
our
knowledge
of
what
mosaism
really
was
can
be
derived
for
it
can
not
in
any
sense
be
regarded
as
the
of
the
subsequent
development
if
it
was
the
work
of
moses
then
we
must
suppose
it
to
have
remained
a
dead
letter
for
centuries
and
only
through
king
josiah
and
ezra
the
scribe
to
have
become
operative
in
the
national
history
compare
sections
and
the
historical
tradition
which
has
reached
us
relating
to
the
period
of
the
judges
and
of
the
kings
of
israel
is
the
main
source
though
only
of
course
in
an
indirect
way
of
our
knowledge
of
mosaism
but
within
the
pentateuch
itself
also
the
historical
tradition
about
moses
which
admits
of
being
distinguished
and
must
carefully
be
separated
from
the
legislative
although
the
latter
often
clothes
itself
in
narrative
form
is
in
its
main
features
manifestly
trustworthy
and
can
only
be
explained
as
resting
on
actual
facts
from
the
historical
tradition
then
it
is
certain
that
moses
was
the
founder
of
the
torah
but
the
legislative
tradition
can
not
tell
us
what
were
the
positive
contents
of
his
torah
in
fact
it
can
be
shown
that
throughout
the
whole
of
the
older
period
the
torah
was
no
finished
legislative
code
but
consisted
entirely
of
the
oral
decisions
and
instructions
of
the
priests
as
a
whole
it
was
potential
only
what
actually
existed
were
the
individual
sentences
given
by
the
priesthood
as
they
were
asked
for
thus
moses
was
not
regarded
as
the
promulgator
once
for
all
of
a
national
constitution
but
rather
as
the
first
to
call
into
activity
the
actual
sense
for
law
and
justice
and
to
begin
the
series
of
oral
decisions
which
were
continued
after
him
by
the
priests
he
was
the
founder
of
the
nation
out
of
which
the
torah
and
prophecy
came
as
later
growths
he
laid
the
basis
of
israel
subsequent
peculiar
individuality
not
by
any
one
formal
act
but
in
virtue
of
his
having
throughout
the
whole
of
his
long
life
been
the
people
leader
judge
and
centre
of
union
a
correct
conception
of
the
manner
in
which
the
torah
was
made
by
him
can
be
derived
from
the
narrative
contained
in
exod
but
not
from
the
long
section
which
follows
relating
to
the
sinaitic
covenant
chap
xix
the
giving
of
the
law
at
sinai
has
only
a
formal
not
to
say
dramatic
significance
it
is
the
product
of
the
poetic
necessity
for
such
a
representation
of
the
manner
in
which
the
people
was
constituted
jehovah
people
as
should
appeal
directly
and
graphically
to
the
imagination
only
so
can
we
justly
interpret
those
expressions
according
to
which
jehovah
with
his
own
mouth
thundered
the
ten
commandments
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
people
below
and
afterwards
for
forty
days
held
a
confidential
conference
with
moses
alone
on
the
summit
for
the
sake
of
producing
a
solemn
and
vivid
impression
that
is
represented
as
having
taken
place
in
a
single
thrilling
moment
which
in
reality
occurred
slowly
and
almost
unobserved
why
sinai
should
have
been
chosen
as
the
scene
admits
of
ready
explanation
it
was
the
olympus
of
the
hebrew
peoples
the
earthly
seat
of
the
godhead
and
as
such
it
continued
to
be
regarded
by
the
israelites
even
after
their
settlement
in
palestine
judges
this
immemorial
sanctity
of
sinai
it
was
that
led
to
its
being
selected
as
the
ideal
scene
of
the
giving
of
the
law
not
conversely
if
we
eliminate
from
the
historical
narrative
the
long
sinaitic
section
which
has
but
a
loose
connection
with
it
the
wilderness
of
kadesh
becomes
the
locality
of
the
preceding
and
subsequent
events
it
was
during
the
sojourn
of
many
years
here
that
the
organisation
of
the
nation
in
any
historical
sense
took
place
there
he
made
for
them
statute
and
ordinance
and
there
he
proved
them
as
we
read
in
exod
xv
in
a
dislocated
poetical
fragment
judgment
and
trial
massa
and
meribah
point
to
kadesh
as
the
place
referred
to
there
at
all
events
is
the
scene
of
the
narrative
immediately
following
exod
xvii
num
xx
and
doubtless
also
of
exod
xviii
if
the
legislation
of
the
pentateuch
cease
as
a
whole
to
be
regarded
as
an
authentic
source
for
our
knowledge
of
what
mosaism
was
it
becomes
a
somewhat
precarious
matter
to
make
any
exception
in
favour
of
the
decalogue
in
particular
the
following
arguments
against
its
authenticity
must
be
taken
into
account
according
to
exod
xxxiv
the
commandments
which
stood
upon
the
two
tables
were
quite
different
the
prohibition
of
images
was
during
the
older
period
quite
unknown
moses
himself
is
said
to
have
made
a
brazen
serpent
which
down
to
hezekiah
time
continued
to
be
worshipped
at
jerusalem
as
an
image
of
jehovah
the
essentially
and
necessarily
national
character
of
the
older
phases
of
the
religion
of
jehovah
completely
disappears
in
the
quite
universal
code
of
morals
which
is
given
in
the
decalogue
as
the
fundamental
law
of
israel
but
the
entire
series
of
religious
personalities
throughout
the
period
of
the
judges
and
the
kings
from
deborah
who
praised
jael
treacherous
act
of
murder
to
david
who
treated
his
prisoners
of
war
with
the
utmost
cruelty
make
it
very
difficult
to
believe
that
the
religion
of
israel
was
from
the
outset
one
of
a
specifically
moral
character
the
true
spirit
of
the
old
religion
may
be
gathered
much
more
truly
from
judges
than
from
exod
xx
it
is
extremely
doubtful
whether
the
actual
monotheism
which
is
undoubtedly
in
the
universal
moral
precepts
of
the
decalogue
could
have
formed
the
foundation
of
a
national
religion
it
was
first
developed
out
of
the
national
religion
at
the
downfall
of
the
nation
and
thereupon
kept
its
hold
upon
the
people
in
an
artificial
manner
by
means
of
the
idea
of
a
covenant
formed
by
the
god
of
the
universe
with
in
the
first
instance
israel
alone
compare
sections
as
for
the
question
regarding
the
historical
presuppositions
of
mosaism
there
generally
underlies
it
a
misunderstanding
arising
out
of
theological
attribute
found
with
special
frequency
among
nontheologians
moses
gave
no
new
idea
of
god
to
his
people
the
question
whence
he
could
have
derived
it
therefore
need
not
be
raised
it
could
not
possibly
be
worse
answered
however
than
by
a
reference
to
his
relations
witb
the
priestly
caste
of
egypt
and
their
wisdom
it
is
not
to
be
believed
that
an
egyptian
deity
could
inspire
the
hebrews
of
goshen
with
courage
for
the
struggle
against
the
egyptians
or
that
an
abstraction
of
esoteric
speculation
could
become
the
national
deity
of
israel
it
is
not
inconceivable
indeed
although
at
the
same
time
quite
incapable
of
proof
that
moses
was
indebted
to
the
egyptian
priests
for
certain
advantages
of
personal
culture
or
that
he
borrowed
from
them
on
all
hands
in
external
details
of
organisation
or
in
matters
of
ritual
but
the
origin
of
the
germ
which
developed
into
israel
is
not
to
be
sought
for
in
egypt
and
jehovah
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
colourless
divinity
of
or
with
the
dreariness
of
certain
modern
egyptologists
that
monotheism
must
have
been
a
foreign
importation
because
it
is
contrary
to
that
sexual
dualism
of
godhead
which
is
the
fundamental
characteristic
of
semitic
religion
is
an
untenable
exaggeration
which
has
recently
become
popular
out
of
opposition
to
the
familiar
thesis
about
the
monotheistic
instinct
of
the
semites
noldeke
literar
moab
ammon
and
edom
nearest
kinsfolk
and
neighbours
were
monotheists
in
precisely
the
same
sense
in
which
israel
itself
was
but
it
would
be
foolish
surely
in
their
case
to
think
of
foreign
importation
manetho
statements
about
the
israelites
are
for
the
most
part
to
be
regarded
as
malicious
inventions
whether
any
genuine
tradition
underlies
them
at
all
is
a
point
much
needing
to
be
investigated
the
story
of
exod
ii
seq
is
a
mythus
of
frequent
recurrence
elsewhere
to
which
no
further
significance
is
attached
for
that
moses
was
trained
in
all
the
wisdom
of
the
egyptians
is
vouched
for
by
no
earlier
authorities
than
philo
and
the
new
testament
according
to
the
old
testament
tradition
his
connexion
is
with
jethro
priesthood
or
with
that
of
the
kenites
this
historical
presupposition
of
mosaism
has
external
evidence
in
its
favour
and
is
inherently
quite
probable
the
settlement
in
palestine
the
kingdom
of
sihon
did
not
permanently
suffice
the
israelites
and
the
disintegration
of
the
canaanites
to
the
west
of
jordan
in
an
endless
number
of
kingdoms
and
cities
invited
attack
the
first
essay
was
made
by
judah
in
conjunction
with
simeon
and
levi
but
was
far
from
prosperous
simeon
and
levi
were
annihilated
judah
also
though
successful
in
mastering
the
mountain
land
to
the
west
of
the
dead
sea
was
so
only
at
the
cost
of
severe
losses
which
were
not
again
made
up
until
the
accession
of
the
kenite
families
of
the
south
caleb
as
a
consequence
of
the
secession
of
these
tribes
a
new
division
of
the
nation
into
israel
and
judah
took
the
place
of
that
which
had
previously
subsisted
between
the
families
of
leah
and
rachel
under
israel
were
included
all
the
tribes
except
simeon
levi
and
judah
which
three
are
no
longer
mentioned
in
judges
where
all
the
others
are
carefully
and
exhaustively
enumerated
this
first
invasion
of
the
west
was
followed
by
a
second
which
was
stronger
and
attended
with
much
better
results
it
was
led
by
the
tribe
of
joseph
to
which
the
others
attached
themselves
reuben
and
gad
only
remaining
behind
in
the
old
settlements
the
district
to
the
north
of
judah
inhabited
afterwards
by
benjamin
was
the
first
to
be
attacked
it
was
not
until
after
several
towns
of
this
district
had
one
by
one
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
conquerors
that
the
canaanites
set
about
a
united
resistance
they
were
however
decisively
repulsed
by
joshua
in
the
neighbourhood
of
gibeon
and
by
this
victory
the
israelites
became
masters
of
the
whole
central
plateau
of
palestine
the
first
camp
at
gilgal
near
the
ford
of
jordan
which
had
been
maintained
until
then
was
now
removed
and
the
ark
of
jehovah
brought
further
inland
perhaps
by
way
of
bethel
to
shiloh
where
henceforward
the
headquarters
were
fixed
in
a
position
which
seemed
as
if
it
had
been
expressly
made
to
favour
attacks
upon
the
fertile
tract
iying
beneath
it
on
the
north
the
bne
rachel
now
occupied
the
new
territory
which
up
to
that
time
had
been
acquired
benjamin
in
immediate
contiguity
with
the
frontier
of
judah
then
ephraim
stretching
to
beyond
shiloh
and
lastly
manasseh
furthest
to
the
north
as
far
as
to
the
plain
of
jezreel
the
centre
of
gravity
so
to
speak
already
lay
in
ephraim
to
which
belonged
joshua
and
that
is
mentioned
as
the
last
achievement
of
joshua
that
at
the
waters
of
merom
he
defeated
jabin
king
of
hazor
and
the
allied
princes
of
galilee
thereby
opening
up
the
north
for
israelitish
settlers
it
is
quite
what
we
should
expect
that
a
great
and
united
blow
had
to
be
struck
at
the
canaanites
of
the
north
before
the
new
comers
could
occupy
it
in
peace
and
king
jabin
who
reappears
at
a
later
date
certainly
does
not
suit
the
situation
described
in
judges
iv
the
book
of
joshua
represents
the
conquest
of
western
palestine
as
having
been
the
common
undertaking
of
all
the
tribes
together
which
after
the
original
inhabitants
have
been
extirpated
are
exhibited
as
laying
the
ownerless
country
at
joshua
feet
in
order
that
he
may
divide
it
by
lot
amongst
them
but
this
is
a
systematic
generalisation
contradicted
by
the
facts
which
we
otherwise
know
for
we
possess
another
account
of
the
conquest
of
palestine
that
of
judges
which
runs
parallel
with
the
book
of
joshua
it
is
shorter
indeed
and
more
superficial
yet
in
its
entire
mode
of
presenting
the
subject
more
historical
according
to
its
narrative
it
appears
that
joshua
was
the
leader
of
joseph
and
benjamin
only
with
whom
indeed
issachar
zebulon
dan
naphtali
and
asher
made
common
cause
but
before
his
time
the
tribe
of
judah
had
already
crossed
the
jordan
and
effected
a
lodgment
in
the
territory
which
lay
between
the
earlier
seat
of
the
nation
in
the
wilderness
of
kadesh
and
its
then
settlement
on
the
plateau
of
moab
forming
in
some
degree
a
link
of
connection
between
the
two
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
tribe
of
judah
had
not
taken
the
longer
route
to
the
eastward
of
the
dead
sea
at
all
but
had
already
at
kadesh
broken
off
from
the
main
body
and
thence
turned
its
steps
directly
northward
but
the
representation
actually
given
in
judges
to
the
effect
that
it
was
from
the
direction
of
the
jordan
and
not
from
that
of
the
negeb
that
they
came
to
take
possession
of
their
land
finds
its
confirmation
in
the
fact
that
the
southern
portion
of
their
territory
was
the
last
to
come
into
their
possession
the
tradition
is
unwavering
that
hebron
was
taken
not
by
judah
but
by
caleb
a
family
which
stood
in
friendly
relations
with
israel
but
had
no
connexion
with
it
by
blood
it
was
only
through
the
policy
of
david
that
caleb
othniel
jerachmeel
and
the
rest
of
the
kenites
who
had
their
homes
in
the
negeb
became
completely
incorporated
with
judah
so
that
hebron
became
at
last
the
capital
of
that
tribe
its
oldest
seats
however
lay
further
to
the
north
in
the
region
of
tekoa
bethlehem
baal
judah
it
harmonises
well
with
this
view
to
suppose
that
simeon
and
levi
must
have
made
at
the
same
time
their
attempt
to
effect
a
settlement
in
the
hill
country
of
ephraim
one
of
their
families
dinah
bath
leah
met
with
a
favourable
reception
in
the
town
of
shechem
and
began
to
mix
freely
with
its
population
and
thus
the
way
was
paved
for
the
establishment
of
peaceable
relations
between
the
old
inhabitants
of
the
land
and
the
new
importations
but
these
relations
were
brought
to
an
end
by
the
two
brothers
who
in
concert
it
must
be
supposed
with
their
sister
fell
upon
the
shechemites
and
massacred
them
the
final
result
proved
disastrous
the
canaanites
of
the
surrounding
country
united
against
them
and
completely
destroyed
them
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
trustworthiness
of
the
somewhat
enigmatical
records
of
those
events
which
are
given
in
xlix
and
xxxiv
in
no
other
way
is
it
possible
to
explain
why
simeon
and
levi
which
originally
came
upon
the
stage
of
history
on
an
equal
footing
with
reuben
and
judah
should
have
already
disappeared
as
independent
tribes
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
period
of
the
judges
now
that
the
destruction
of
shechem
by
the
manassite
abimelech
is
quite
distinct
from
the
attack
made
by
simeon
and
levi
need
hardly
be
said
on
the
other
hand
the
occurrence
can
not
be
regarded
as
but
must
be
assigned
to
a
time
previous
to
the
conquest
of
the
hill
country
of
ephraim
by
joseph
for
after
joseph
settlement
there
the
two
sons
of
leah
had
manifestly
nothing
more
to
hope
for
in
that
locality
we
are
shut
up
therefore
to
the
conclusion
that
they
crossed
the
jordan
at
the
same
time
as
judah
separated
himself
from
the
main
body
in
search
of
a
suitable
territory
that
simeon
accompanied
judah
in
the
first
westward
attempt
is
expressly
stated
in
judges
i
the
fate
of
levi
again
can
not
be
separated
from
that
of
simeon
xlix
that
he
is
not
expressly
mentioned
in
judges
ought
not
to
cause
surprise
when
it
is
considered
that
later
generations
which
regarded
levi
as
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
priest
would
have
some
difficulty
in
representing
him
as
a
thoroughly
secular
tribe
such
nevertheless
he
must
have
been
for
the
poet
in
genesis
xlix
puts
him
on
a
footing
of
perfect
equality
with
simeon
and
attributes
to
both
brothers
a
very
secular
and
bloodthirsty
character
he
has
no
conception
that
levi
has
a
sacred
vocation
which
is
the
reason
of
the
dispersion
of
the
tribe
the
dispersion
on
the
contrary
is
regarded
as
a
curse
and
no
blessing
an
annihilation
and
not
the
means
of
giving
permanence
to
its
tribal
individuality
the
shattered
remains
of
simeon
and
doubtless
those
of
levi
also
became
incorporated
with
judah
which
thenceforward
was
the
sole
representative
of
the
three
sons
of
leah
who
according
to
the
genealogy
had
been
born
immediately
after
reuben
the
judah
itself
seems
at
the
same
time
to
have
suffered
severely
of
its
three
older
branches
er
onan
and
shelah
one
only
survived
and
only
by
the
accession
of
foreign
elements
did
the
tribe
regain
its
vigour
by
the
fresh
blood
which
the
kenites
of
the
negeb
brought
for
zarah
and
pharez
which
took
the
place
of
er
and
onan
after
these
had
disappeared
belonged
originally
not
to
israel
but
to
hezron
or
the
kenites
under
this
designation
are
included
families
like
those
of
othniel
jerachmeel
and
caleb
and
as
has
been
already
remarked
even
in
david
time
these
were
not
reckoned
as
strictly
belonging
to
judah
thus
the
depletion
which
the
tribe
had
to
suffer
in
the
struggle
with
the
canaanites
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
of
the
judges
was
the
remote
cause
of
the
prominence
which
according
to
the
bne
hezron
afterwards
attained
in
judah
the
survivors
of
simeon
also
appear
to
have
been
forced
back
upon
these
hezronites
in
the
negeb
the
cities
assigned
to
them
in
the
book
of
joshua
all
belong
to
that
region
even
after
the
united
resistance
of
the
canaanites
had
been
broken
each
individual
community
had
still
enough
to
do
before
it
could
take
firm
hold
of
the
spot
which
it
had
searched
out
for
itself
or
to
which
it
had
been
assigned
the
business
of
effecting
permanent
settlement
was
just
a
continuation
of
the
former
struggle
only
on
a
diminished
scale
every
tribe
and
every
family
now
fought
for
its
own
land
after
the
preliminary
work
had
been
accomplished
by
a
united
effort
naturally
therefore
the
conquest
was
at
first
but
an
incomplete
one
the
plain
which
fringed
the
coast
was
hardly
touched
so
also
the
valley
of
jezreel
with
its
girdle
of
fortified
cities
stretching
from
acco
to
bethshean
all
that
was
subdued
in
the
strict
sense
of
that
word
was
the
mountainous
land
particularly
the
southern
hill
country
of
mount
ephraim
yet
even
here
the
canaanites
retained
possession
of
not
a
few
cities
such
as
jebus
shechem
thebez
it
was
only
after
the
lapse
of
centuries
that
all
the
lacunae
were
filled
up
and
the
canaanite
enclaves
made
tributary
the
israelites
had
the
extraordinarily
disintegrated
state
of
the
enemy
to
thank
for
the
ease
with
which
they
had
achieved
success
the
first
storm
subsided
comparatively
soon
and
conquerors
and
conquered
alike
learned
to
accommodate
themselves
to
the
new
circumstances
then
the
canaanites
once
more
collected
all
their
energies
to
strike
a
blow
for
freedom
under
the
hegemony
of
sisera
a
great
league
was
formed
and
the
plain
of
jezreel
became
the
centre
of
the
reorganised
power
which
made
itself
felt
by
its
attacks
both
northwards
and
southwards
the
israelites
were
strangely
helpless
it
was
as
if
neither
shield
nor
spear
could
be
found
among
their
fighting
men
but
at
last
there
came
an
impulse
from
above
and
brought
life
and
soul
to
the
unorganised
mass
deborah
sent
out
the
summons
to
the
tribes
barak
came
forward
as
their
leader
against
the
kings
of
canaan
who
had
assembled
under
sisera
command
by
the
brook
of
kishon
the
cavalry
of
the
enemy
was
unable
to
withstand
the
impetuous
rush
of
the
army
of
jehovah
and
sisera
himself
perished
in
the
flight
from
that
day
the
canaanites
although
many
strong
towns
continued
to
be
held
by
them
never
again
raised
their
heads
after
these
occurrences
some
further
changes
of
a
fundamental
character
took
place
in
the
relations
of
the
tribes
the
danites
proved
unable
to
hold
against
the
forward
pressure
of
the
philistines
their
territory
on
the
coast
to
the
west
of
benjamin
and
ephraim
they
accordingly
sought
a
new
settlement
which
was
found
in
the
north
at
the
foot
of
hermon
in
this
way
all
the
secondary
tribes
westward
of
jordan
asher
naphtali
dan
came
to
have
their
seats
beside
each
other
in
the
northern
division
of
the
land
eastward
of
jordan
reuben
rapidly
fell
from
his
old
prominence
sharing
the
fate
of
his
next
eldest
brethren
simeon
and
levi
when
eglon
of
moab
took
jericho
and
laid
benjamin
under
tribute
it
is
obvious
that
he
must
previously
have
made
himself
master
of
reuben
territory
this
territory
became
thenceforward
a
subject
of
constant
dispute
between
moab
and
israel
the
efforts
to
recover
it
however
did
not
proceed
from
reuben
himself
but
from
gad
a
tribe
which
knew
how
to
assert
itself
with
vigour
against
the
enemies
by
which
it
was
surrounded
but
if
the
hebrews
lost
ground
in
the
south
they
materially
enlarged
their
borders
in
the
north
of
the
land
eastward
of
jordan
various
manassite
families
finding
their
holdings
at
home
too
small
crossed
the
jordan
and
founded
colonies
at
bashan
and
northern
gilead
although
this
colonisation
on
account
of
the
rivalry
of
the
aramaeans
who
were
also
pressing
forward
in
this
direction
was
but
imperfectly
successful
it
nevertheless
was
of
very
great
importance
inasmuch
as
it
seemed
to
give
new
strength
to
the
bonds
that
united
the
eastern
with
the
western
tribes
not
only
was
gilead
not
lost
it
even
became
a
very
vigorous
member
of
the
body
politic
it
is
probable
that
manasseh
migration
to
the
territory
eastward
of
jordan
took
place
from
the
west
and
later
than
the
time
of
moses
the
older
portions
of
the
hexateuch
speak
not
of
two
and
a
half
but
only
of
two
tribes
and
exclude
manasseh
according
to
them
the
kingdom
of
sihon
alone
was
subdued
by
moses
not
that
of
og
also
the
latter
indeed
being
a
wholly
legendary
personage
in
the
song
of
deborah
machir
is
reckoned
among
the
western
tribes
and
it
was
not
until
much
later
that
this
became
the
designation
of
the
manassites
eastward
of
jordan
it
is
also
worth
noticing
that
jair
colonisation
of
northern
gilead
did
not
take
place
until
the
time
of
the
judges
judges
x
seq
but
is
related
also
in
num
xxxii
the
times
of
agitation
and
insecurity
which
followed
upon
the
conquest
of
palestine
invited
attacks
by
the
eastern
nomads
and
once
more
the
israelite
peasantry
showed
all
its
old
helplessness
until
at
last
the
indignation
of
a
manassite
of
good
family
gideon
or
jerubbaal
was
roused
by
the
midianites
who
had
captured
some
of
his
brothers
and
put
them
to
death
with
his
family
that
of
abiezer
he
gave
pursuit
and
overtaking
the
enemy
on
the
borders
of
the
wilderness
inflicted
on
them
such
chastisement
as
put
an
end
to
these
incursions
his
heroism
had
consequences
which
reached
far
beyond
the
scope
of
his
original
purpose
he
became
the
champion
of
the
peasantry
against
the
freebooters
of
the
cultivated
land
against
the
waste
social
respect
and
predominance
were
his
rewards
in
his
native
town
of
ophrah
he
kept
up
a
great
establishment
where
also
he
built
a
temple
with
an
image
of
jehovah
overlaid
with
the
gold
which
he
had
taken
from
the
midianites
he
transmitted
to
his
sons
an
authority
which
was
not
limited
to
abiezer
and
manasseh
alone
but
however
slightly
and
indirectly
extended
over
ephraim
as
well
on
the
foundations
laid
by
gideon
abimelech
his
son
sought
to
establish
a
kingship
over
israel
that
is
over
ephraim
and
manasseh
the
predominance
however
which
had
been
naturally
accorded
to
his
father
in
virtue
of
his
personal
merits
abimelech
looked
upon
as
a
thing
seized
by
force
and
to
be
maintained
with
injustice
and
in
this
way
he
soon
destroyed
those
fair
beginnings
out
of
which
even
at
that
time
a
kingdom
might
have
arisen
within
the
house
of
joseph
the
one
permanent
fruit
of
his
activity
was
that

the
most
important
change
of

period
of

went
on
gradually
and
in
silence
the
old
population
of
the
country
which
according
to
deuteronomy
was
to
have
been
exterminated
slowly
became
amalgamated
with
the
new
in
this
way
the
israelites
received
a
very
important
accession
to
their
numbers

in

we
find
a
population
reckoned
by
millions
the
rapid
increase
is
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
incorporation
of
the
canaanites
at
the
same
time
the
hebrews
learned
to
participate
in
the
culture
of
the
canaanites
and
quietly
entered
into
the
enjoyment
of
the
labours
of
their
predecessors
from
the
pastoral
they
advanced
to
the
agricultural
stage
corn
and
wine
the
olive
and
the
fig
with
them
are
habitually
spoken
of
as
the
necessaries
of
life
it
was
not
strange
that
this
change
in
the
manner
of
their
everyday
life
should
be
attended
with
certain
consequences
in
the
sphere
of
religion
also
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
israelites
should
have
brought
with
them
out
of
the
desert
the
cultus
they
observed
in
the
time
of
the
kings
exod
xxii
xxiii
xxiv
which
throughout
presupposed
the
fields
and
gardens
of
palestine
they
borrowed
it
from
the
canaanites
in
the
earliest
case
where
the
feast
of
the
ingathering
afterwards
the
chief
feast
of
the
israelites
is
mentioned
it
is
celebrated
by
canaanites
of
shechem
in
honour
of
baal
judges
ix
this
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
they
took
over
from
these
the
bamoth
or
high
places
also
notwithstanding
the
prohibition
in
deuteronomy
xii
it
was
natural
enough
that
the
hebrews
should
also
appropriate
the
divinity
worshipped
by
the
canaanite
peasants
as
the
giver
of
their
corn
wine
and
oil
the
baal
whom
the
greeks
identified
with
dionysus
the
apostasy
to
baal
on
the
part
of
the
first
generation
which
had
quitted
the
wilderness
and
adopted
a
settled
agricultural
life
is
attested
alike
by
historical
and
prophetical
tradition
doubtless
baal
as
the
god
of
the
land
of
canaan
and
jehovah
as
the
god
of
the
nation
of
israel
were
in
the
first
instance
in
judges
jehovah
retains
his
original
abode
in
the
wilderness
of
sinai
and
only
on
occasions
of
necessity
quits
it
to
come
to
palestine
but
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
the
divinity
of
the
land
should
permanently
be
different
from
the
god
of
the
dominant
people
in
proportion
as
israel
identified
itself
with
the
conquered
territory
the
divinities
also
were
identified
hence
arose
a
certain
syncretism
between
baal
and
jehovah
which
had
not
been
got
over
even
in
the
time
of
the
prophet
hosea
at
the
same
time
the
functions
of
baal
were
more
frequently
transferred
to
jehovah
than
conversely
canaan
and
baal
represented
the
female
israel
and
jehovah
the
male
principle
in
this
union
had
the
israelites
remained
in
the
wilderness
and
in
barbarism
the
historical
development
they
subsequently
reached
would
hardly
have
been
possible
their
career
would
have
been
like
that
of
amalek
or
at
best
like
those
of
edom
moab
and
ammon
their
acceptance
of
civilisation
was
undoubtedly
a
step
in
the
forward
direction
but
as
certainly
did
it
also
involve
a
peril
it
involved
an
overloading
as
it
were
of
the
system
with
materials
which
it
was
incapable
of
assimilating
at
once
the
material
tasks
imposed
threatened
to
destroy
the
religious
basis
of
the
old
national
life
the
offensive
and
defensive
alliances
among
the
tribes
gradually
dissolved
under
the
continuance
of
peace
the
subsequent
occupation
of
the
country
dispersed
those
whom
the
camp
had
united
the
enthusiastic
with
which
the
conquest
had
been
achieved
gave
way
to
the
petty
drudgery
by
which
the
individual
families
each
in
its
own
circle
had
to
accommodate
themselves
to
their
new
surroundings
yet
under
the
ashes
the
embers
were
still
aglow
and
the
course
of
history
ever
fanned
them
anew
into
flame
bringing
home
to
israel
the
truths
that
man
does
not
live
by
bread
alone
and
that
there
are
other
things
of
worth
than
those
which
baal
can
bestow
it
brought
ever
again
into
the
foreground
the
divineness
of
heroical
self
sacrifice
of
the
individual
for
the
good
of
the
nation
the
foundation
of
the
kingdom
and
the
first
three
kings
the
philistines
were
the
means
of
arousing
from
their
slumber
israel
and
jehovah
from
their
settlements
by
the
sea
on
the
plain
which
skirts
the
mountains
of
judah
on
the
west
they
pressed
northwards
into
the
plain
of
sharon
and
thence
into
the
plain
of
jezreel
beyond
which
is
connected
with
that
of
sharon
by
the
upland
valley
of
dothan
here
having
driven
out
the
danites
they
came
into
direct
contact
with
the
tribe
of
joseph
the
chief
bulwark
of
israel
and
a
great
battle
took
place
at
aphek
where
the
plain
of
sharon
merges
into
the
valley
of
dothan
the
philistines
were
victorious
and
carried
off
as
a
trophy
the
israelite
standard
the
ark
of
jehovah
their
further
conquests
included
not
only
the
plain
of
jezreel
and
the
hill
country
bordering
it
on
the
south
but
also
the
proper
citadel
of
the
country
mount
ephraim
the
old
sanctuary
at
shiloh
was
destroyed
by
them
its
temple
of
jehovah
thenceforward
lay
in
ruins
their
supremacy
extended
as
far
as
to
benjamin
the
philistines
had
a
nec
ib
in
gibeah
is
an
aramaic
word
of
uncertain
meaning
in
the
name
of
the
town
nisibis
it
certainly
seems
to
mean
pillars
according
to
iv
and
xxii
where
it
is
pointed
niccab
governor
seems
the
best
translation
and
this
is
the
only
rendering
consistent
with
the
expression
in
xiii
jonathan
slew
the
but
the
assertion
that
they
had
confiscated
all
weapons
and
removed
all
smiths
must
be
regarded
as
an
unhistorical
exaggeration
under
their
regime
at
all
events
it
was
possible
for
the
messengers
of
a
beleaguered
city
on
the
east
of
jordan
to
summon
their
countrymen
in
the
west
to
their
relief
the
shame
of
the
israelites
under
the
reproach
of
philistine
oppression
led
in
the
first
instance
to
a
widespread
exaltation
of
religious
feeling
troops
of
ecstatic
enthusiasts
showed
themselves
here
and
there
and
went
about
with
musical
accompaniments
in
processions
which
often
took
the
shape
of
wild
dances
even
men
of
the
most
sedate
temperament
were
sometimes
smitten
with
the
contagion
and
drawn
into
the
charmed
circle
in
such
a
phenomenon
occurring
in
the
east
there
was
nothing
intrinsically
strange
among
the
canaanites
such
nebiim
for
so
they
were
styled
had
long
been
familiar
and
they
continued
to
exist
in
the
country
after
the
old
fashion
long
after
their
original
character
so
far
as
israel
was
concerned
had
been
wholly
lost
the
new
thing
at
this
juncture
was
that
this
spirit
passed
over
upon
israel
and
that
the
best
members
of
the
community
were
seized
by
it
it
afforded
an
outlet
for
the
suppressed
excitement
of
the
nation
the
zeal
had
for
its
object
not
the
abolition
of
baal
worship
but
resistance
to
the
enemies
of
israel
religion
and
patriotism
were
then
identical
this
spirit
of
the
times
was
understood
by
an
old
man
samuel
ben
elkanah
who
lived
at
ramah
in
ephraim
he
was
not
himself
one
of
the
nebiim
on
the
contrary
he
was
a
seer
of
that
old
type
which
had
for
a
long
time
existed
amongst
the
hebrews
much
as
we
find
it
amongst
the
greeks
or
arabs
raised
by
his
foreseeing
talent
to
a
position
of
great
prominence
he
found
opportunity
to
occupy
himself
with
other
questions
besides
those
which
he
was
professionally
called
on
to
answer
the
national
distress
weighed
upon
his
heart
the
neighbouring
peoples
had
taught
him
to
recognise
the
advantages
which
are
secured
by
the
consolidation
of
families
and
tribes
into
a
kingdom
but
samuel
peculiar
merit
lay
not
in
discovering
what
it
was
that
the
nation
needed
but
in
finding
out
the
man
who
was
capable
of
supplying
that
need
having
come
to
know
saul
ben
kish
a
benjamite
of
the
town
of
gibeah
a
man
of
gigantic
form
and
swift
enthusiastic
nature
he
declared
to
him
his
destiny
to
become
king
over
israel
saul
very
soon
had
an
opportunity
for
showing
whether
samuel
had
been
a
true
seer
or
no
the
city
of
jabesh
in
gilead
was
besieged
by
the
ammonites
and
the
inhabitants
declared
themselves
ready
to
surrender
should
they
fail
in
obtaining
speedy
succour
from
their
countrymen
their
messengers
had
passed
through
all
israel
without
meeting
with
anything
more
helpful
than
pity
until
at
last
tidings
of
their
case
reached
saul
as
he
was
returning
with
a
yoke
of
oxen
from
the
field
hewing
his
cattle
in
pieces
he
caused
the
portions
to
be
sent
in
all
directions
with
the
threat
that
so
should
it
be
done
with
the
oxen
of
every
one
who
should
refuse
to
help
in
relieving
jabesh
the
people
obeyed
the
summons
fell
suddenly
one
morning
upon
the
ammonites
and
delivered
the
beleaguered
city
having
thus
found
saul
the
man
for
their
need
they
refused
to
let
him
go
in
gilgal
joshua
old
camp
they
anointed
him
king
the
act
was
equivalent
to
imposing
upon
him
the
conduct
of
the
struggle
against
the
philistines
and
so
he
understood
it
the
first
signal
for
the
attack
was
given
by
his
son
jonathan
when
he
slew
the
of
the
philistines
at
gibeah
these
in
consequence
advanced
in
force
towards
the
focus
of
the
revolt
and
took
up
a
position
opposite
gibeah
on
the
north
being
divided
from
it
only
by
the
gorge
of
michmash
only
a
few
hundred
benjamites
ventured
to
remain
with
saul
the
struggle
opened
with
a
piece
of
genuine
old
heroic
daring
while
the
philistines
were
dispersed
over
the
country
in
foraging
expeditions
jonathan
accompanied
by
his
only
and
without
the
knowledge
of
saul
made
an
attack
upon
the
weak
post
which
they
had
left
behind
at
the
pass
of
michmash
after
the
first
had
been
surprised
and
overmastered
the
others
took
to
flight
no
doubt
in
the
belief
that
the
two
assailants
were
supported
they
carried
their
panic
with
them
into
the
camp
whence
it
spread
among
the
various
foraging
bands
the
commotion
was
observed
from
gibeah
opposite
and
without
pausing
to
consult
the
priestly
oracle
king
saul
determined
to
attack
the
camp
the
attempt
was
completely
successful
but
involved
no
more
than
the
camp
and
its
stores
the
philistines
themselves
effected
an
unmolested
retreat
by
the
difficult
road
of
bethhoron
saul
was
no
mere
raw
stripling
when
he
ascended
the
throne
he
already
had
a
son
at
his
side
nor
was
he
of
insignificant
descent
the
family
to
which
he
belonged
being
a
widespread
one
and
his
heritage
considerable
his
establishment
at
gibeah
was
throughout
his
entire
reign
the
nucleus
of
his
kingdom
the
men
on
whom
he
could
always
reckon
were
his
benjamite
kinsmen
he
recognised
as
belonging
to
him
no
other
public
function
besides
that
of
war
the
internal
affairs
of
the
country
he
permitted
to
remain
as
they
had
been
before
his
accession
war
was
at
once
the
business
and
the
resource
of
the
new
kingdom
it
was
carried
on
against
the
philistines
without
interruption
though
for
the
most
part
not
in
the
grand
style
but
rather
in
a
series
of
border
skirmishes
as
regards
the
position
of
samuel
in
the
theocracy
and
the
relation
in
which
the
stood
to
saul
the
several
narratives
in
the
book
of
samuel
differ
widely
the
preceding
account
so
far
as
it
relates
to
samuel
is
based
upon
x
where
he
appears
simply
as
a
roeh
at
ramah
and
has
nothing
to
do
either
with
the
administration
of
the
theocracy
or
with
the
nebiim
compare
prolegomena
above
chap
vii
it
is
not
without
significance
that
the
warlike
revival
of
the
nation
proceeded
from
benjamin
by
the
battle
of
aphek
ephraim
had
lost
at
once
the
hegemony
and
its
symbols
the
at
shiloh
the
ark
of
the
covenant
the
centre
of
israel
gravitated
southward
and
benjamin
became
the
connecting
link
between
ephraim
and
judah
it
would
appear
that
there
the
tyranny
of
the
philistines
was
not
so
much
felt
their
attacks
never
were
made
through
judah
but
always
came
from
the
north
on
the
other
hand
people
fled
from
them
southwards
as
is
instanced
by
the
priests
of
shiloh
who
settled
in
nob
near
jerusalem
through
saul
judah
entered
definitely
into
the
history
of
israel
it
belonged
to
his
kingdom
and
it
more
than
most
others
supplied
him
with
energetic
and
faithful
supporters
his
famous
expedition
against
the
amalekites
had
been
undertaken
purely
in
the
interests
of
judah
for
it
only
could
possibly
suffer
from
their
marauding
hordes
among
the
men
of
judah
whom
the
war
brought
to
gibeah
david
ben
jesse
of
bethlehem
took
a
conspicuous
place
his
skill
on
the
harp
brought
him
into
close
relations
with
the
king
he
became
afterwards
the
most
intimate
friend
of
his
son
finally
the
husband
of
his
daughter
while
he
was
thus
winning
the
affections
of
the
court
he
at
the
same
time
became
the
declared
favourite
of
the
people
the
more
so
because
unexampled
good
fortune
attended
him
in
all
he
undertook
this
excited
the
jealousy
of
saul
naturally
enough
in
an
age
in
which
the
king
always
required
to
be
the
best
man
its
first
outburst
admitted
of
explanation
as
occasioned
by
an
attack
of
illness
but
soon
it
became
obtrusively
clear
that
the
king
love
for
his
had
changed
into
bitter
hatred
jonathan
warned
his
friend
and
facilitated
his
flight
the
priests
of
nob
at
the
same
time
providing
him
with
arms
and
food
he
went
into
the
wilderness
of
judah
and
became
the
leader
of
a
miscellaneous
band
of
outlaws
who
had
been
attracted
by
his
name
to
lead
a
roving
life
under
his
leadership
his
kinsmen
from
bethlehem
were
of
their
number
but
also
philistines
and
hittites
out
of
this
band
bodyguard
subsequently
grew
the
nucleus
of
his
army
they
reckoned
also
a
priest
among
them
abiathar
ben
ahimelech
ben
ahitub
ben
phinehas
ben
eli
the
solitary
survivor
of
the
massacre
of
the
sons
of
eli
at
nob
which
saul
had
ordered
on
account
of
suspected
conspiracy
with
david
through
him
david
was
able
to
have
recourse
to
the
sacred
lot
before
the
ephod
in
the
end
he
found
it
impossible
to
hold
his
own
in
judah
against
persecutions
especially
as
his
countrymen
for
the
most
part
withheld
their
assistance
he
therefore
took
the
desperate
step
of
placing
his
services
at
the
disposal
of
achish
the
philistine
king
of
gath
by
whom
he
was
received
with
open
arms
the
town
of
ziklag
being
assigned
him
as
a
residence
here
with
his
band
he
continued
to
follow
his
old
manner
of
life
as
an
independent
prince
subject
only
to
an
obligation
to
render
military
service
to
achish
meanwhile
the
philistines
had
once
more
mustered
their
forces
and
marched
by
the
usual
route
against
israel
saul
did
not
allow
them
to
advance
upon
gibeah
but
awaited
their
attack
in
the
plain
of
jezreel
a
disastrous
battle
on
mount
gilboa
ensued
after
seeing
his
three
eldest
sons
fall
one
after
another
at
his
side
saul
threw
himself
upon
his
sword
and
was
followed
by
his
the
defeat
seemed
to
have
undone
the
work
of
his
life
the
immediate
consequence
at
least
was
that
the
philistines
regained
their
lost
ascendancy
over
the
country
to
the
west
of
jordan
beyond
jordan
however
abner
the
cousin
and
generalissimo
of
saul
made
his
son
ishbaal
still
a
minor
king
in
mahanaim
and
he
was
successful
in
again
establishing
the

of

house
over
jezreel
ephraim
and
benjamin
of
course
in
uninterrupted
struggle
with
the
philistines
but
he
did
not
regain
hold
of
judah
david
seized
the
opportunity
to
set
up
for
himself
with
the
sanction
of
the
philistines
and
it
may
safely
be
presumed
as
their
vassal
a
separate
principality
which
had
its
centre
of
gravity
in
the
south
which
was
inhabited
not
by
the
tribe
of
judah
properly
so
called
but
by
the
calebites
and
jerachmeelites
this
territory
abner
disputed
with
him
in
vain
in
the
protracted
feud
between
the
houses
of
saul
and
david
the
fortunes
of
war
declared
themselves
ever
increasingly
for
the
latter
personal
causes
at
last
brought
matters
to
a
crisis
abner
by
taking
to
himself
a
concubine
of
saul
called
rizpah
had
roused
ishbaal
suspicions
that
he
was
aiming
at
the
inheritance
and
was
challenged
on
the
point
this
proved
too
much
for
his
patience
and
forthwith
he
abandoned
the
cause
of
his
ward
the
hopelessness
of
which
had
already
perhaps
become
apparent
and
entered
into
negotiations
with
david
at
hebron
when
about
to
set
out
on
his
return
he
fell
by
the
hand
of
joab
in
the
gate
of
hebron
a
victim
of
jealousy
and
his
plans
nevertheless
were
realised
his
death
left
israel
leaderless
and
in
great
confusion
ishbaal
was
personally
insignificant
and
the
people
homage
continued
to
be
rendered
to
him
only
out
of
grateful
fidelity
to
his
father
memory
at
this
juncture
he
also
fell
by
assassins
hands
as
he
was
taking
his
midday
rest
and
even
the
portress
had
gone
to
sleep
over
her
task
of
cleaning
wheat
two
benjamite
captains
introduced
themselves
into
his
palace
at
mahanaim
and
murdered
him
in
the
vain
hope
of
earning
david
thanks
the
elders
of
israel
no
longer
hesitated
about
offering
david
the
crown
which
he
accepted
his
residence
was
immediately
transferred
from
hebron
to
jebus
which
until
then
had
remained
in
possession
of
the
canaanites
and
first
derives
historical
importance
from
him
it
lay
on
the
border
between
israel
and
judah
still
within
the
territory
of
benjamin
but
not
far
from
bethlehem
near
also
to
nob
the
old
priestly
city
david
made
it
not
only
the
political
but
also
the
religious
metropolis
by
transferring
thither
from
kirjathjearim
the
ark
of
the
covenant
which
he
placed
within
his
citadel
on
what
afterwards
became
the
temple
hill
still
the
crown
was
far
from
being
a
merely
honorary
possession
it
involved
heavy
responsibilities
and
doubtless
what
contributed
more
than
anything
else
to
david
elevation
to
the
throne
was
the
general
recognition
of
the
fact
that
he
was
the
man
best
fitted
on
the
whole
to
overtake
the
labour
it
brought
with
it
the
prosecution
of
the
war
with
the
philistines
a
war
which
was
as
it
were
the
forge
in
which
the
kingdom
of
israel
was
welded
into
one
the
struggle
began
with
the
transference
of
the
seat
of
royalty
to
jerusalem
unfortunately
we
possess
only
scanty
details
as
to
its
progress
hardly
anything
more
indeed
than
a
few
anecdotes
about
deeds
of
prowess
by
individual
heroes
the
result
was
in
the
end
that
david
completed
what
saul
had
begun
and
broke
for
ever
the
philistine
yoke
this
was
undoubtedly
the
greatest
achievement
of
his
reign
from
the
defensive
against
the
philistines
david
proceeded
to
aggressive
war
in
which
he
subjugated
the
three
kinsfolk
of
israel
moab
ammon
and
edom
he
appears
to
have
come
into
conflict
first
with
the
moabites
whom
he
vanquished
and
treated
with
savage
atrocity
not
long
afterwards
the
king
of
ammon
died
and
david
sent
an
embassy
of
condolence
to
hanun
his
successor
hanun
suspected
in
this
a
sinister
design
a
suspicion
we
can
readily
understand
if
david
had
already
as
is
probable
subjugated
moab
and
with
the
utmost
contumely
sent
back
the
messengers
to
their
master
forthwith
at
the
same
time
making
preparations
for
war
by
entering
into
alliance
with
various
syrian
kings
and
particularly
with
the
powerful
king
of
soba
soba
appears
to
have
been
situated
somewhat
to
the
north
of
damascus
and
to
have
bordered
on
the
west
with
hamath
the
aramaeans
were
beginning
even
at
that
period
to
press
westwards
the
hittites
phoenicians
and
israelites
had
common
interests
against
them
to
the
kingdom
of
soba
succeeded
afterwards
that
of
damascus
david
took
the
initiative
and
sent
his
army
under
command
of
joab
against
the
syrians
advanced
to
the
relief
of
the
besieged
city
but
joab
divided
his
forces
and
leaving
his
brother
abishai
to
hold
the
ammonites
in
the
town
in
check
proceeded
himself
against
the
syrians
and
repulsed
them
on
their
afterwards
threatening
to
renew
the
attack
in
increased
force
david
went
against
them
in
strength
and
defeated
them
at
helam
on
the
river
it
seems
that
as
a
result
of
this
the
kingdom
of
soba
was
broken
up
and
made
tributary
to
damascus
could
not
now
hold
out
any
longer
and
the
ammonites
shared
the
fate
of
their
moabite
brethren
finally
edom
was
about
the
same
time
coerced
and
depopulated
and
thus
was
fulfilled
the
vision
of
balaam
the
youngest
of
the
four
hebrew
nationalities
trod
the
three
elder
under
his
feet
so
far
as
external
foes
were
concerned
david
henceforward
had
peace
but
new
dangers
arose
at
home
within
his
own
family
at
once
by
leniency
and
equally
severity
he
had
completely
alienated
his
son
absalom
who
after
death
was
to
the
throne
absalom
organised
a
revolt
against
his
father
and
to
foster
it
availed
himself
of
a
misunderstanding
which
had
arisen
between
david
and
the
men
of
judah
probably
because
they
thought
they
were
not
treated
with
sufficient
favour
the
revolt
had
its
focus
in
hebron
ahithophel
a
man
of
judah
was
its
soul
amasa
also
of
judah
its
arm
but
the
rest
of
israel
was
also
drawn
into
the
rebellion
and
only
the
territory
to
the
east
of
jordan
remained
faithful
thither
david
betook
himself
with
precipitancy
for
the
outbreak
had
taken
him
completely
by
surprise
at
mahanaim
which
had
once
before
been
the
centre
from
which
the
kingdom
was
regained
he
collected
his
faithful
followers
around
him
with
his
cherethites
and
pelethites
for
a
nucleus
absalom
against
ahithophel
advice
allowing
him
time
for
this
in
the
neighbourbood
of
mahanaim
in
the
wood
of
ephraim
the
decisive
blow
was
struck
absalom
fell
and
with
his
death
the
rebellion
was
at
an
end
it
was
joseph
that
in
the
first
instance
penitently
sent
a
deputation
to
the
king
to
bring
him
back
judah
on
the
other
hand
continued
to
hold
aloof
ultimately
a
piece
of
finesse
on
the
king
part
had
the
effect
of
bringing
judah
also
to
its
allegiance
though
at
the
cost
of
kindling
such
jealousy
between
israel
and
judah
that
sheba
the
benjamite
raised
a
new
revolt
this
time
of
israelites
which
was
soon
however
repressed
by
joab
david
seems
to
have
died
soon
afterwards
his
historical
importance
is
very
great
judah
and
jerusalem
were
wholly
his
creation
and
though
the
united
kingdom
of
israel
founded
by
him
and
saul
together
soon
fell
to
pieces
the
recollection
of
it
nevertheless
continued
in
all
time
to
be
proudly
cherished
by
the
whole
body
of
the
people
his
personal
character
has
been
often
treated
with
undue
disparagement
for
this
we
must
chiefly
blame
his
canonisation
by
the
later
jewish
tradition
which
made
a
levitical
saint
of
him
and
a
pious
it
then
becomes
a
strange
inconsistency
that
he
caused
military
prisoners
to
be
treated
with
barbarity
and
the
bastard
sons
of
saul
to
be
hanged
up
before
the
lord
in
gibeon
but
if
we
take
him
as
we
find
him
an
antique
king
in
a
barbarous
age
our
judgment
of
him
will
be
much
more
favourable
the
most
daring
courage
was
combined
in
him
with
tender
susceptibility
even
after
he
had
ascended
the
throne
be
continued
to
retain
the
charm
of
a
and
at
the
same
time
personality
even
his
conduct
in
the
affair
of
uriah
is
not
by
any
means
wholly
to
his
discredit
not
many
kings
can
be
mentioned
who
would
have
shown
repentance
public
and
deep
such
as
he
manifested
at
nathan
rebuke
least
to
his
credit
was
his
weakness
in
relation
to
his
sons
and
to
joab
on
the
other
hand
the
testament
attributed
to
him
in
ii
can
not
be
justly
laid
to
his
charge
it
is
the
libel
of
a
later
hand
seeking
to
invest
him
with
a
fictitious
glory
in
like
manner
it
is
unjust
to
hold
him
responsible
for
the
deaths
of
abner
and
amasa
or
to
attribute
to
him
any
conspiracy
with
the
hierocracy
for
the
destruction
of
saul
and
thus
to
deprive
him
of
the
authorship
of
the
elegy
in
i
which
certainly
was
not
the
work
of
a
hypocrite
solomon
had
already
reached
the
throne
some
time
before
his
father
death
not
in
virtue
of
hereditary
right
but
by
palace
intrigue
which
had
the
support
of
the
bodyguard
of
the
six
hundred
his
glory
was
not
purchased
on
the
battlefield
so
far
was
he
from
showing
military
capacity
that
he
allowed
a
new
syrian
kingdom
to
arise
at
damascus
a
far
more
dangerous
thing
for
israel
than
that
of
soba
which
had
been
destroyed
and
which
it
succeeded
during
this
reign
edom
also
regained
its
independence
nothing
but
the
port
of
elath
remaining
in
solomon
hands
as
regards
moab
and
ammon
we
have
no
information
it
is
not
improbable
that
they
also
revolted
but
if
war
was
not
forte
he
certainly
took
much
greater
pains
than
either
of
his
predecessors
in
matters
of
internal
administration
according
to
tradition
the
wisdom
of
the
ruler
and
the
judge
was
his
special
gift
disregarding
the
tribal
system
he
divided
his
kingdom
into
twelve
provinces
over
each
of
which
he
placed
a
royal
governor
thus
making
a
beginning
of
vigorous
and
orderly
administration
very
possibly
the
canaanites
whose
complete
absorption
falls
within
this
period
were
an
element
that
helped
to
loosen
the
bonds
of
tribal
unity
and
consolidate
a
state
in
its
place
judah
alone
he
exempted
from
this
arrangement
as
if
to
show
special
favour
for
his
aim
was
less
the
advantage
of
his
subjects
than
the
benefit
of
his
exchequer
and
the
same
object
appears
in
his
horse
traffic
ix
his
ophir
trade
x
and
his
cession
of
territory
to
hiram
ix
his
passions
were
architecture
a
gorgeous
court
and
the
harem
in
which
he
sought
to
rival
other
oriental
kings
as
for
example
his
egyptian
for
this
he
required
copious
labour
tribute
in
kind
and
money
he
had
especially
at
heart
the
extension
and
improvement
of
jerusalem
as
a
strong
and
splendid
capital
the
temple
which
he
built
was
only
a
portion
of
his
vast
citadel
which
included
within
its
precincts
a
number
of
private
and
public
buildings
designed
for
various
uses
it
is
plain
that
new
currents
were
introduced
into
the
stream
of
the
nation
development
by
such
a
king
as
this
as
formerly
after
the
occupation
canaanite
culture
had
come
in
so
now
after
the
establishment
of
the
kingdom
the
floodgate
was
open
for
the
admission
of
oriental
civilisation
in
a
deeper
and
wider
sense
whatever
the
personal
motives
which
led
to
it
may
have
been
the
results
were
very
importent
and
by
no
means
disadvantageous
on
the
whole
on
the
basis
of
the
firmer
administration
now
introduced
stability
and
order
could
rest
judah
had
no
cause
to
regret
its
acceptance
of
this
yoke
closer
intercourse
with
foreign
lands
widened
the
intellectual
horizon
of
the
people
and
at
the
same
time
awakened
it
to
a
deeper
sense
of
its
own
peculiar
individuality
if
solomon
imported
phoenician
and
egyptian
elements
into
the
worship
of
jehovah
at
his
court
temple
the
rigid
old
israelite
indeed
might
naturally
enough
take
offence
exodus
xx
but
the
temple
itself
nevertheless
ultimately
acquired
a
great
and
positive
importance
for
religion
it
need
not
be
denied
that
mischievous
consequences
of
various
kinds
slipped
in
along
with
the
good
the
king
moreover
can
hardly
be
blamed
for
his
conduct
in
erecting
in
the
neighbourhood
of
jerusalem
altars
to
deities
of
ammon
and
egypt
for
those
altars
remained
undisturbed
until
the
time
of
josiah
although
between
solomon
and
him
there
reigned
more
than
one
pious
king
who
would
certainly
have
destroyed
them
had
he
found
them
as
offensive
as
did
the
author
of
deuteronomy
from
jeroboam
i
to
jeroboam
ii
after
the
death
of
solomon
the
discontent
which
had
been
aroused
by
his
innovations
and
especially
by
the
rigour
of
his
government
openly
showed
itself
against
his
successor
and
when
rehoboam
curtly
refused
the
demands
which
had
been
laid
before
him
by
an
assembly
of
the
elders
at
shechem
they
withdrew
from
their
allegiance
and
summoned
to
be
their
king
the
ephraimite
jeroboam
ben
nebat
who
already
had
made
an
abortive
attempt
at
revolt
from
solomon
and
afterwards
had
taken
refuge
in
egypt
only
judah
and
jerusalem
remained
faithful
to
the
house
of
david
among
the
causes
of
the
revolt
of
the
ten
tribes
jealousy
of
judah
must
certainly
be
reckoned
as
one
the
power
of
joseph
had
been
weakened
by
the
philistines
and
by
the
establishment
of
the
monarchy
the
centre
of
gravity
had
been
shifted
from
the
north
where
it
naturally
lay
but
now
it
was
restored
to
its
old
seat
for
once
more
it
was
situated
not
in
judah
but
in
joseph
monarchy
itself
however
was
not
abolished
by
the
revolting
tribes
conclusively
showing
how
unavoidable
and
how
advantageous
that
institution
was
now
felt
to
be
but
at
the
same
time
they
did
not
refrain
from
attempts
to
combine
its
advantages
with
those
of
anarchy
a
folly
which
was
ultimately
the
cause
of
their
ruin
as
for
their
departure
from
the
mosaic
cultus
observed
at
jerusalem
on
the
other
hand
it
was
first
alleged
against
them
as
a
sin
only
by
the
later
jews
at
the
time
religion
put
no
obstacle
in
the
way
of
their
separation
on
the
contrary
it
actually
suggested
and
promoted
it
ahijah
of
shiloh
the
jerusalem
cultus
had
not
yet
come
to
be
regarded
as
the
alone
legitimate
that
instituted
by
jeroboam
at
bethel
and
at
dan
was
recognised
as
equally
right
images
of
the
deity
were
exhibited
in
all
three
places
and
indeed
in
every
place
where
a
house
of
god
was
found
so
far
as
the
religious
and
intellectual
life
of
the
nation
was
concerned
there
was
no
substantial
difference
between
the
two
kingdoms
except
indeed
in
so
far
as
new
displays
of
vigorous
initiative
generally
proceeded
from
israel
even
in
the
deuteronomic
redaction
of
the
book
of
kings
indeed
and
still
more
by
the
chronicler
the
political
rebellion
of
israel
is
regarded
as
having
been
ecclesiastical
and
religious
in
its
character
the
book
of
chronicles
regards
samaria
as
a
heathen
kingdom
and
recognises
judah
alone
as
israel
but
in
point
of
fact
judah
takes
up
the
history
of
israel
only
after
the
fall
of
samaria
see
rehoboam
did
not
readily
accept
the
situation
he
sought
to
reduce
the
revolt
by
force
of
arms
with
what
degree
of
success
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
his
rival
found
himself
constrained
to
take
up
his
residence
at
peniel
near
mahanaim
on
the
other
side
of
jordan
the
invasion
of
shishak
however
who
took
jerusalem
and
burnt
it
gave
jeroboam
at
last
a
breathing
space
the
feud
continued
indeed
but
rehoboam
could
no
longer
dream
of
bringing
back
the
ten
tribes
the
scale
by
and
by
turned
in
favour
king
baasha
who
had
seated
himself
on
the
throne
in
place
of
nadab
jeroboam
son
took
the
offensive
and
asa
ben
rehoboam
had
no
help
for
it
but
to
call
in
benhadad
of
damascus
against
his
adversary
in
this
way
he
gained
his
immediate
purpose
it
is
true
but
by
the
most
dangerous
of
expedients
baasha
son
elah
was
supplanted
by
his
vizier
zimri
who
however
was
in
his
turn
unable
to
hold
his
own
against
omri
who
had
supreme
command
of
the
army
against
omri
there
arose
in
another
part
of
the
country
a
rival
tibni
ben
ginath
who
succeeded
in
maintaining
some
footing
until
his
death
when
omri
became
supreme
omri
must
be
regarded
as
the
founder
of
the
first
dynasty
in
the
proper
sense
of
that
word
in
israel
and
as
the
second
founder
of
the
kingdom
itself
to
which
he
gave
a
permanent
capital
in
samaria
the
bible
has
hardly
anything
to
tell
us
about
him
but
his
importance
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
among
the
assyrians
the
kingdom
of
omri
bit
humri
like
oikos
and
similar
territorial
names
in
syriac
was
the
ordinary
name
of
israel
according
to
the
inscription
of
mesha
it
was
he
who
again
subjugated
moab
which
had
become
independent
at
the
death
of
david
or
of
solomon
he
was
not
so
successful
against
the
damascenes
to
whom
he
had
to
concede
certain
privileges
in
his
own
capital
xx
omri
accession
is
to
be
placed
somewhere
about
it
is
a
date
and
the
first
that
can
be
determined
with
some
precision
if
we
place
the
battle
of
karkar
near
the
end
of
reign
and
take
the
servitude
of
moab
which
lasted
forty
years
and
ended
with
ahab
deatb
to
begin
in
omri
first
decade
ahab
who
succeeded
omri
his
father
seems
during
the
greater
part
of
his
reign
to
have
in
some
sort
acknowledged
syrian
suzerainty
in
no
other
way
can
we
account
for
the
fact
that
in
the
battle
of
karkar
against
the
assyrians
a
contingent
was
contributed
by
him
but
this
very
battle
made
the
political
situation
so
clear
that
he
was
led
to
break
off
his
relations
with
damascus
with
this
began
a
series
of
ferocious
attacks
on
israel
by
benhadad
and
hazael
they
were
met
by
ahab
with
courage
and
success
but
in
the
third
year
of
that
fifty
years
war
he
fell
in
the
battle
at
ramoth
gilead
after
the
events
recorded
in
a
forced
alliance
with
damascus
on
the
part
of
samaria
is
incredible
but
the
idea
of
spontaneous
friendly
relations
is
also
inadmissible
schrader
indeed
finds
support
for
the
latter
theory
in
xx
but
in
that
passage
there
is
no
word
of
any
offensive
or
defensive
alliance
between
the
rival
kings
all
that
is
stated
is
that
ahab
releases
the
captive
benhadad
on
condition
bbryt
that
the
latter
undertakes
certain
obligations
particularly
those
of
keeping
the
peace
and
restoring
the
cities
which
had
been
taken
by
this
arrangement
no
change
was
made
in
the
previously
strained
relations
of
the
two
kingdoms
and
moreover
the
bryt
was
not
kept
xxii
not
much
nearer
the
truth
than
the
preceding
is
the
view
that
the
danger
threatened
by
assyria
drove
the
kings
of
syria
and
palestine
into
one
another
arms
and
so
occasioned
an
alliance
between
ahab
and
benhadad
also
for
if
feelings
of
hostility
existed
at
all
between
the
two
last
named
then
ahab
could
not
do
otherwise
than
congratulate
himself
that
in
the
person
of
shalmaneser
ii
there
had
arisen
against
benhadad
an
enemy
who
would
be
able
to
keep
him
effectually
in
check
that
shalmaneser
might
prove
dangerous
to
himself
probably
did
not
at
that
time
occur
to
him
but
if
it
had
he
would
still
have
chosen
the
remote
in
preference
to
the
immediately
threatening
evil
for
it
was
the
political
existence
of
israel
that
was
at
stake
in
the
struggle
with
damascus
in
such
circumstances
every
ally
would
of
course
be
welcome
every
enemy
of
the
enemy
would
be
hailed
as
a
friend
and
the
political
wisdom
which
max
duncker
attributes
to
ahab
would
have
been
nothing
less
than
unpardonable
folly
the
state
of
matters
was
at
the
outset
in
this
respect
just
what
it
continued
to
be
throughout
the
subsequent
course
of
events
the
assyrian
danger
grew
in
subsequent
years
and
with
it
grew
the
hostility
between
damascus
and
samaria
this
fact
admits
only
of
one
explanation
that
the
israelites
utilised
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
for
their
own
protection
against
the
syrians
the
difficulties
into
which
the
latter
were
thrown
by
shalmaneser
and
that
these
in
their
turn
when
the
assyrians
gave
them
respite
were
all
the
fiercer
in
their
revenge
on
the
evidence
of
the
monuments
and
the
bible
we
may
even
venture
to
assert
that
it
was
the
assyrian
attacks
upon
damascus
which
at
that
time
preserved
israel
from
becoming
aramaic
of
course
only
because
israel
made
the
most
of
them
for
her
political
advantage
assuming
that
ahab
the
israelite
ahabu
sirlaai
fought
in
the
battle
of
karkar
on
the
side
of
the
king
of
damascus
it
was
only
because
he
could
not
help
himself
but
if
it
is
actually
the
case
that
he
did
so
the
battle
of
karkar
must
have
taken
place
before
the
events
recorded
in
xx
the
moabites
took
advantage
of
an
accession
under
such
critical
circumstances
to
shake
off
the
yoke
imposed
by
omri
forty
years
before
an
accurate
account
of
their
success
obviously
written
while
the
impression
of
it
was
still
fresh
has
come
down
to
it
is
obvious
that
mesha
narrative
is
to
be
taken
with
i
and
not
with
iii
us
in
the
famous
inscription
of
king
mesha
ahaziah
immediate
successor
was
obliged
to
accept
the
situation
after
his
early
death
a
futile
attempt
again
to
subjugate
them
was
made
by
his
brother
joram
such
a
campaign
was
possible
to
him
only
in
the
event
of
the
syrians
keeping
quiet
and
in
point
of
fact
it
would
appear
that
they
were
not
in
a
position
to
follow
up
the
advantage
they
had
gained
at
ramoth
doubtless
they
were
hampered
by
the
inroads
of
the
assyrians
in
and
as
soon
as
they
got
a
little
respite
however
they
lost
no
time
in
attacking
joram
driving
him
into
his
capital
where
they
besieged
him
samaria
had
already
been
brought
to
the
utmost
extremities
of
famine
when
suddenly
the
enemy
raised
the
siege
on
account
of
a
report
of
an
invasion
of
their
own
land
by
the
egyptians
and
hittites
possibly
we
ought
to
understand
by
these
the
assyrians
rather
who
in
renewed
their
attacks
upon
syria
to
ordinary
people
in
israel
the
assyrians
were
an
unknown
quantity
for
which
it
would
be
natural
in
popular
story
to
substitute
something
more
familiar
this
turn
of
affairs
relieved
joram
from
his
straits
it
would
even
seem
that
favoured
by
a
change
of
dynasty
at
damascus
he
had
succeeded
in
taking
from
the
syrians
the
fortress
of
ramoth
in
gilead
which
had
been
the
object
of
unsuccessful
endeavours
when
suddenly
there
burst
upon
the
house
of
omri
the
overwhelming
catastrophe
for
which
the
prophets
had
long
been
preparing
when
the
prophets
first
made
their
appearance
some
time
before
the
beginning
of
the
philistine
war
they
were
a
novel
phenomenon
in
israel
but
in
the
interval
they
had
become
so
naturalised
that
they
now
had
a
recognised
and
essential
place
in
connection
with
the
religion
of
jehovah
they
had
in
the
process
divested
themselves
of
much
that
had
originally
characterised
them
but
they
still
retained
their
habit
of
appearing
in
companies
and
living
together
in
societies
and
also
that
of
wearing
a
peculiar
distinctive
dress
these
societies
of
theirs
had
no
ulterior
aims
the
rabbinical
notion
that
they
were
schools
and
academies
in
which
the
study
of
the
torah
and
of
sacred
history
was
pursued
imports
later
ideas
into
an
earlier
time
importance
on
the
whole
can
not
be
claimed
for
the
nebiim
but
occasionally
there
arose
amongst
them
a
man
in
whom
the
spirit
which
was
cultivated
within
their
circles
may
be
said
to
have
risen
to
the
explosive
pitch
historical
influence
was
exercised
at
no
time
save
by
these
individuals
who
rose
above
their
order
and
even
placed
themselves
in
opposition
to
it
but
always
at
the
same
time
had
their
base
of
operations
within
it
the
prototype
of
this
class
of
exceptional
prophets
whom
we
not
unjustly
have
been
accustomed
to
regard
as
the
true
is
elijah
of
thisbe
the
contemporary
of
ahab
ln
compliment
to
jezebel
his
wife
ahab
had
set
up
in
samaria
a
temple
with
richly
endowed
religious
services
in
honour
of
the
syrian
baal
in
doing
so
he
had
no
intention
of
renouncing
jehovah
jehovah
continued
to
be
the
national
god
after
whom
he
named
his
sons
ahaziah
and
jehoram
the
destruction
of
altars
or
the
persecution
of
his
prophets
was
not
at
all
proposed
or
even
the
introduction
of
a
foreign
cultus
elsewhere
than
in
samaria
jehovah
sovereignty
over
israel
being
thus
only
remotely
if
at
all
imperilled
the
popular
faith
found
nothing
specially
offensive
in
a
course
of
action
which
had
been
followed
a
hundred
years
before
by
solomon
also
elijah
alone
was
strenuous
in
his
opposition
the
masses
did
not
understand
him
and
were
far
from
taking
his
side
to
him
only
but
not
to
the
nation
did
it
seem
like
a
halting
between
two
opinions
an
irreconcilable
inconsistency
that
jehovah
should
be
worshipped
as
israel
god
and
a
chapel
to
baal
should
at
the
same
time
be
erected
in
israel
in
solitary
grandeur
did
this
prophet
tower
conspicuously
over
his
time
legend
and
not
history
could
alone
preserve
the
memory
of
his
figure
there
remains
a
vague
impression
that
with
him
the
development
of
israel
conception
of
jehovah
entered
upon
a
new
stadium
rather
than
any
data
from
which
it
can
be
ascertained
wherein
the
contrast
of
the
new
with
the
old
lay
after
jehovah
acting
more
immediately
within
the
political
sphere
had
established
the
nation
and
kingdom
he
now
began
in
the
spiritual
sphere
to
operate
against
the
foreign
elements
the
infusion
of
which
previously
had
been
permitted
to
go
on
almost
unchecked
it
is
worth
noticing
how
much
more
frequent
from
this
period
onwards
proper
names
compounded
with
the
word
jehovah
become
among
the
names
of
the
judges
and
of
the
kings
before
ahab
in
israel
and
asa
in
judah
not
a
single
instance
occurs
thenceforward
they
become
the
rule
the
rechabites
who
arose
at
that
time
protested
in
their
zeal
for
jehovah
altogether
against
all
civilisation
which
presupposes
agriculture
and
in
their
fundamental
principles
aimed
at
a
recurrence
to
the
primitive
nomadic
life
of
israel
in
the
wilderness
the
nazarites
abstained
at
least
from
wine
the
chief
symbol
of
dionysiac
civilisation
in
this
indeed
elijah
was
not
with
them
had
he
been
so
he
would
doubtless
have
been
intelligible
to
the
masses
but
comprehending
as
he
did
the
spirit
from
which
these
demonstrations
proceeded
he
thought
of
jehovah
as
a
great
principle
which
can
not
coexist
in
the
same
heart
with
baal
to
him
first
was
it
revealed
that
we
have
not
in
the
various
departments
of
nature
a
variety
of
forces
worthy
of
our
worship
but
that
there
exists
over
all
but
one
holy
one
and
one
mighty
one
who
reveals
himself
not
in
nature
but
in
law
and
righteousness
in
the
world
of
man
the
indignation
he
displayed
against
the
judicial
murder
at
jezreel
was
as
genuine
and
strong
as
that
which
he
manifested
against
the
worship
of
baal
in
samaria
the
one
was
as
much
a
crime
against
jehovah
as
the
other
elijah
ascended
to
heaven
before
he
had
actually
achieved
much
in
the
world
the
idea
which
his
successors
took
from
him
was
that
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
thorough
clearance
from
samaria
of
the
baal
worship
and
of
the
house
of
ahab
as
well
for
this
practical
end
elisha
made
use
of
practical
means
when
elijah
after
the
murder
of
naboth
had
suddenly
appeared
before
ahab
and
threatened
him
with
a
violent
end
an
officer
of
high
command
had
been
present
jehu
ben
nimshi
and
he
had
never
forgotten
the
incident
he
now
found
himself
at
the
head
of
the
troops
at
ramoth
gilead
after
the
withdrawal
to
jezreel
of
joram
ben
ahab
from
the
field
to
be
healed
of
his
wound
to
elisha
the
moment
seemed
a
suitable
one
for
giving
to
jehu
in
jehovah
name
the
command
now
to
carry
out
elijah
threat
against
the
house
of
ahab
jehu
gained
over
the
captains
of
the
army
and
carried
out
so
well
the
task
with
which
the
prophet
had
commissioned
him
that
not
a
single
survivor
of
ahab
dynasty
or
of
his
court
was
left
he
next
extirpated
baal
and
his
worshippers
in
samaria
from
that
date
no
worship
of
foreign
gods
seems
ever
to
have
recurred
in
israel
idolatry
indeed
continued
to
subsist
but
the
images
stones
and
trees
even
the
seraphim
apparently
belonged
to
the
cultus
of
jehovah
or
were
at
least
brought
into
relation
with
it
jehu
founded
the
second
and
last
dynasty
of
the
kingdom
of
samaria
his
inheritance
from
the
house
of
omri
included
the
task
of
defending
himself
against
the
syrians
the
forces
at
his
disposal
being
insufficient
for
this
he
resorted
to
the
expedient
of
seeking
to
urge
the
assyrians
to
renew
their
hostilities
against
the
arameeans
for
this
end
his
ambassadors
carried
presents
to
shalmaneser
ii
these
were
not
of
a
regular
but
only
of
an
occasional
character
but
the
vanity
of
the
great
king
represents
them
as
the
tribute
of
a
vassal
in
the
years
and
assyrian
campaigns
against
hazael
of
damascus
actually
took
place
then
they
were
intermitted
for
a
long
time
and
the
kings
of
samaria
jehu
and
his
two
successors
were
left
to
their
own
resources
these
were
evil
times
for
israel
with
a
barbarity
never
intermitted
the
frontier
war
went
on
in
gilead
where
ammon
and
moab
showed
themselves
friendly
to
the
syrian
cause
amos
i
occasionally
great
expeditions
took
place
one
of
which
brought
king
hazael
to
the
very
walls
of
jerusalem
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
israel
independence
was
maintained
once
more
religion
went
hand
in
hand
with
the
national
cause
the
prophet
elisha
was
the
main
stay
of
the
kings
in
the
struggle
with
the
syrians
the
chariot
and
horsemen
of
israel
joash
ben
joahaz
ben
jehu
at
last
succeeded
in
inflicting
upon
syria
several
blows
which
proved
decisive
thenceforward
israel
had
nothing
to
fear
from
that
quarter
under
joash
son
jeroboam
the
kingdom
even
reached
a
height
of
external
power
which
recalled
the
times
of
david
moab
was
again
subdued
southwards
the
frontier
extended
to
the
brook
of
the
wilderness
amos
vi
and
northward
to
hamath
god
the
world
and
the
life
of
men
in
old
israel
before
proceeding
to
consider
the
rise
of
those
prophets
who
were
the
makers
of
the
new
israel
it
will
not
be
out
of
place
here
to
cast
a
glance
backwards
upon
the
old
order
of
things
which
perished
with
the
kingdom
of
samaria
with
reference
to
any
period
earlier
than
the
century
we
can
hardly
be
said
to
possess
any
statistics
for
while
the
facts
of
history
admit
of
being
handed
down
with
tolerable
accuracy
through
a
considerable
time
a
contemporary
literature
is
indispensable
for
the
description
of
standing
conditions
but
it
was
within
this
period
that
hebrew
literature
first
flourished
after
the
syrians
had
been
finally
repulsed
it
would
seem
writing
of
course
had
been
practiced
from
a
much
earlier
period
but
only
in
formal
instruments
mainly
upon
stone
at
an
early
period
also
the
historical
sense
of
the
people
developed
itself
in
connection
with
their
religion
but
it
found
its
expression
in
songs
which
in
the
first
instance
were
handed
down
by
word
of
mouth
only
literature
began
with
the
collection
and
writing
out
of
those
songs
book
of
the
wars
of
the
and
book
of
were
the
oldest
historical
books
the
transition
was
next
made
to
the
writing
of
prose
history
with
the
aid
of
legal
documents
and
family
reminiscences
a
large
portion
of
this
early
historiography
has
been

perhaps
the
legends
about

and

times
the
origin
of
which
can
not
be
assigned
to
a
very
early
date
even
the
jehovistic
narratives
about
the

belong
to
the
time

had
already
become

is
the

of

the
question
why
it
was
that
elijah
and
elisha
committed
nothing
to
writing
while
amos
a
hundred
years
later
is
an
author
hardly
admits
of
any
other
answer
than
that
in
the
interval
a
had
developed
into
a
literary
age
how
rapid
the
process
was
may
be
gathered
from
a
comparison
between
the
singularly
broken
utterances
of
the
earlier
oracle
contained
in
isaiah
xv
xvi
with
the
orations
of
isaiah
himself
we
begin
our
survey
with
that
of
the
family
relations
polygamy
was
rare
monogamy
the
rule
but
the
right
of
concubinage
was
unlimited
while
a
high
position
was
accorded
both
by
affection
and
custom
to
the
married
wife
traces
still
existed
of
a
state
of
society
in
which
she
was
regarded
as
property
that
went
with
the
inheritance
the
marriage
of
relations
was
by
no
means
prohibited
no
offence
was
taken
at
the
circumstance
that
abraham
was
the
husband
of
his
sister
by
a
different
mother
parents
had
full
power
over
their
children
they
had
the
right
to
sell
and
even
to
sacrifice
them
in
this
respect
however
the
prevailing
usage
was
mild
as
also
in
regard
to
slaves
who
socially
held
a
position
of
comparative
equality
with
their
masters
and
even
enjoyed
some
measure
of
legal
protection
slavery
it
is
plain
had
not
thc
same
political
importance
as
with
the
greeks
and
romans
it
could
have
been
abolished
without
any
shock
to
the
foundations
of
the

throughout
this

agriculture
and

that

the

grew
more
influential

notably
increased
and
the

of

was
quite
unable
to
arrest

progress
of

from

onwards
were
the

set

they
eagerly
sought
to
acquire
suitable

and
in

or
in

with
the
syrians
entered
upon
large
commercial
transactions
the
extortions
of
the
the
formation
of
large
estates
the
frequency
of
mortgages
all
show
that
the
small
peasant
proprietorship
was
unable
to
hold
its
own
against
the
accumulations
of
wealth
the
class
increased
and
cases
in
which
free
hebrews
sold
themselves
into
slavery
were
not
rare
on
all
hands
the
material
progress
of
the
commonwealth
made
itself
felt
the
old
simplicity
of
manners
disappeared
and
luxury
increased
buildings
of
hewn
stone
began
to
be
used
even
by
private
individuals
the
towns
especially
the
chief
ones
were
fortified
and
in
time
of
war
refuge
was
sought
in
them
and
not
as
formerly
in
woods
and
caves
even
in
the
time
of
david
the
israelites
always
fought
on
foot
but
now
horses
and
chariots
were
regarded
as
indispensable
the
bow
came
to
be
the
principal
weapon
of
offence
and
a
military
class
appears
to
have
sprung
up
the
monarchy
retained
in
the
kingdom
of
the
ten
tribes
its
military
character
the
was
the
first
person
in
the
kingdom
in
internal
affairs
its
interference
was
slight
with
systematic
despotism
it
had
little
in
common
although
of
course
within
its
narrow
sphere
it
united
executive
and
legislative
functions
it
was
little
more
than
the
greatest
house
in
israel
the
highest
official
was
called
master
of
the
household
the
court
ultimately
grew
into
a
capital
the
municipal
offices
of
which
were
held
by
royal
officials
the
provinces
had
governors
who
however
in
time
of
war
withdrew
to
the
capital
xx
the
presumption
is
that
their
sole
charge
was
collection
of
the
revenue
the
state
was
not
charged
with
affairs
of
internal
administration
all
parties
were
left
free
to
maintain
their
own
interests
only
in
cases
in
which
conflicts
had
emerged
in
consequence
could
the
king
be
approached
ruling
and
judging
were
regarded
as
one
and
the
same
there
was
but
one
word
for
both
xv
still
the
king
was
not
altogether
the
only
judge
there
were
in
fact
a
number
of
independent
jurisdictions
wherever
within
a
particular
circle
the
power
lay
there
the
right
of
judging
was
also
found
whether
exercised
by
heads
of
families
and
communities
or
by
warriors
and
powerful
lords
it
was
only
because
the
king
was
the
most
powerful
that
he
was
regarded
as
the
judge
of
last
resort
but
it
was
equally
permitted
to
apply
to
him
from
the
first
of
method
and
rule
in
these
things
there
was
but
little
a
man
was
glad
to
find
any
court
to
receive
his
complaint
of
course
without
complaint
one
got
no
justice
the
administration
of
justice
was
at
best
but
a
scanty
supplement
to
the
practice
of
the
heir
of
the
murdered
man
would
not
forego
the
right
of
blood
revenge
but
his
family
or
the
commune
gave
him
aid
and
in
case
of
need
took
his
place
for
bloodshed
had
at
all
hazards
to
be
atoned
for
the
firm
establishment
of
civil
order
was
rendered
all
the
more
difficult
by
the
continual
wars
and
violent
changes
of
dynasty
which
ever
and
anon
made
its
very
existence
problematical
power
which
is
more
important
than
righteousness
to
a
judicatory
was
what
the
government
was
wanting
in
in
the
simpler
social
conditions
of
the
earlier
time
a
state
which
was
adapted
merely
for
purposes
of
war
might
easily
be
found
to
work
satisfactorily
enough
but
a
more
complex
order
of
things
had
now
arisen
social
problems
had
begun
to
crop
up
for
the
poor
and
the
proletariat
the
protection
of
a
thoughtful
government
had
come
to
be
required
but
was
not
forthcoming
but
these
defects
did
not
check
all
progress
the
weakness
of
the
government
the
want
of
political
consolidation
were
insufficient
to
arrest
intellectual
advance
or
to
corrupt
the
prevailing
moral
tone
and
feeling
for
justice
in
fact
it
was
precisely
in
this
period
the
period
in
which
the
main
part
of
the
jehovistic
history
must
have
been
written
that
the
intellectual
and
moral
culture
of
the
people
stood
at
its
highest
even
when
the
machinery
of
the
monarchy
had
got
out
of
order
the
organisation
of
the
families
and
communes
continued
to
subsist
the
smaller
circles
of
social
life
remained
comparatively
untouched
by
the
catastrophes
that
shook
the
greater
above
all
the
national
religion
supplied
the
spiritual
life
with
an
immovable
basis
the
favourite
illustrations
of
the
power
of
religion
in
the
israel
of
that
period
are
drawn
from
the
instances
of
great
prophets
who
raised
kings
out
of
the
dust
and
smote
them
to
it
again
but
the
influence
and
importance
of
these
is
generally
exaggerated
in
the
accounts
we
have
that
among
them
there
occasionally
occurred
manifestations
of
such
power
as
to
give
a
new
turn
in
history
is
indeed
true
a
figure
like
that
of
elijah
is
no
mere
invention
but
such
a
man
as
he
was
a
prophecy
of
the
future
rather
than
an
actual
agent
in
shaping
the
present
on
the
whole
religion
was
a
peaceful
influence
conserving
rather
than
assailing
the
existing
order
of
things
the
majority
of
the
prophets
were
no
revolutionists
rather
in
fact
were
they
always
too
much
inclined
to
prophesy
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
the
party
in
power
besides
in
ordinary
circumstances
their
influence
was
inferior
to
that
of
the
priests
who
were
servants
of
royalty
at
the
chief
sanctuaries
but
everywhere
attached
to
the
established
order
the
torah
of
jehovah
still
continued
to
be
their
special
charge
it
was
not
even
now
a
code
or
law
in
our
sense
of
the
word
jehovah
had
not
yet
made
his
testament
he
was
still
living
and
active
in
israel
but
the
torah
appears
during
this
period
to
have
withdrawn
itself
somewhat
from
the
business
of
merely
pronouncing
legal
decisions
and
to
have
begun
to
move
in
a
freer
field
it
now
consisted
in
teaching
the
knowledge
of
god
in
showing
the
right
way
where
men
were
not
sure
of
themselves
many
of
the
counsels
of
the
priests
had
become
a
common
stock
of
moral
convictions
which
indeed
were
all
of
them
referred
to
jehovah
as
their
author
yet
had
ceased
to
be
matters
of
direct
revelation
nevertheless
the
torah
had
still
occupation
enough
the
progressive
life
of
the
nation
ever
affording
matter
for
new
questions
although
in
truth
the
torah
and
the
moral
influence
of
jehovah
upon
the
national
life
were
things
much
weightier
and
much
more
genuinely
israelitic
than
the
cultus
yet
this
latter
held
on
the
whole
a
higher
place
in
public
opinion
to
the
ordinary
man
it
was
not
moral
but
liturgical
acts
that
seemed
to
be
truly
religious
altars
of
jehovah
occurred
everywhere
with
sacred
stones
and
trees
the
latter
either
artificial
asheras
or
natural
beside
them
it
was
considered
desirable
also
to
have
water
in
the
neighbourhood
brazen
sea
in
cases
where
a
temple
stood
before
the
altar
it
contained
an
ephod
and
teraphim
a
kind
of
images
before
which
the
lot
was
cast
by
the
priest
of
the
old
simplicity
the
cultus
retained
nothing
at
the
great
sanctuaries
especially
bethel
gilgal
beersheba
it
had
become
very
elaborate
its
chief
seasons
were
the
agricultural
festivals
the
passover
the
feast
of
weeks
and
most
especially
the
feast
of
the
ingathering
at
the
close
of
the
year
these
were
the
only
occasions
of
public
worship
properly
so
called
at
which
every
one
was
expected
to
attend
in
other
cases
each
worshipper
sought
the
presence
of
god
only
in
special
circumstances
as
for
example
at
the
beginning
and
at
the
end
of
particular
undertakings
the
cultus
as
to
place
time
matter
and
form
belonged
almost
entirely
to
the
inheritance
which
israel
had
received
from
canaan
to
distinguish
what
belonged
to
the
worship
of
jehovah
from
that
which
belonged
to
baal
was
no
easy
matter
the
description
of
the
cultus
by
the
prophet
hosea
shows
this
very
clearly
it
is
obvious
enough
however
that
the
object
was
to
serve
jehovah
and
not
any
foreign
deity
by
this
worship
it
was
the
channel
through
which
also
paganism
could
and
did
ever
anew
gain
admittance
into
the
worship
of
jehovah
yet
that
publicity
of
the
cultus
which
arose
out
of
the
very
nature
of
jehovah
and
in
consequence
of
which
the
teraphim
even
were
removed
from
the
houses
to
the
temples
can
not
but
have
acted
as
a
corrective
against
the
most
fatal
excesses
as
for
the
substance
of
the
national
faith
it
was
summed
up
principally
in
the
proposition
that
jehovah
is
the
god
of
israel
but
god
was
equivalent
to
helper
that
was
the
meaning
of
the
word
help
assistance
in
all
occasions
of
life
that
was
what
israel
looked
for
from
jehovah
not
salvation
in
the
theological
sense
the
forgiveness
of
sins
was
a
matter
of
subordinate
importance
it
was
involved
in
the
help
and
was
a
matter
not
of
faith
but
of
experience
the
relation
between
the
people
and
god
was
a
natural
one
as
that
of
son
to
father
it
did
not
rest
upon
observance
of
the
conditions
of
a
pact
but
it
was
not
on
that
account
always
equally
lively
and
hearty
jehovah
was
regarded
as
having
varieties
of
mood
to
secure
and
retain
his
favour
sacrifices
were
useful
by
them
prayer
and
thanksgiving
were
seconded
another
main
article
of
faith
was
that
jehovah
judges
and
recompenses
not
after
death
then
all
men
were
thought
to
be
alike
but
upon
the
earth
here
however
but
little
account
was
taken
of
the
individual
over
him
the
wheel
of
destiny
remorselessly
rolled
his
part
was
resignation
and
not
hope
not
in
the
career
of
the
individual
but
in
the
fate
of
families
and
nations
did
the
righteousness
of
jehovah
find
scope
for
its
manifestation
and
this
is
the
only
reason
why
the
religion
could
dispense
with
the
conceptions
of
heaven
and
hell
for
the
rest
it
was
not
always
easy
to
bring
the
second
article
into
correlation
with
the
first
in
practice
the
latter
received
the
superior
place
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
superstition
of
every
kind
also
abounded
but
the
superstition
of
the
israelites
had
as
little
real
religious
significance
as
had
that
poetical
view
of
nature
which
the
hebrews
doubtless
shared
in
greater
or
less
degree
with
all
the
other
nations
of
antiquity
the
fall
of
samaria
under
king
jeroboam
two
years
before
a
great
earthquake
that
served
ever
after
for
a
date
to
all
who
had
experienced
it
there
occurred
at
bethel
the
greatest
and
most
conspicuous
sanctuary
of
jehovah
in
israel
a
scene
full
of
significance
the
multitude
were
assembled
there
with
gifts
and
offerings
for
the
observance
of
a
festival
when
there
stepped
forward
a
man
whose
grim
seriousness
interrupted
the
joy
of
the
feast
it
was
a
judaean
amos
of
tekoa
a
shepherd
from
the
wilderness
bordering
on
the
dead
sea
into
the
midst
of
the
joyful
tones
of
the
songs
which
with
harp
and
tabor
were
being
sung
at
the
sacred
banquet
he
brought
the
discordant
note
of
the
mourner
wail
for
over
all
the
joyous
stir
of
busy
life
his
ear
caught
the
sounds
of
death
the
virgin
of
israel
is
fallen
never
more
to
rise
lies
prostrate
in
her
own
land
with
no
one
to
lift
her
up
he
prophesied
as
close
at
hand
the
downfall
of
the
kingdom
which
just
at
that
moment
was
rejoicing
most
in
the
consciousness
of
power
and
the
deportation
of
the
people
to
a
northern
land
there
was
something
rotten
in
the
state
of
israel
in
spite
of
the
halcyon
days
it
enjoyed
under
jeroboam
ii
from
the
indirect
results
of
war
from
changes
in
the
tenure
and
in
the
culture
of
the
soil
from
defective
administration
of
justice
the
humbler
classes
had
much
to
suffer
they
found
that
the
times
were
evil
but
it
was
not
this
that
caused
amos
to
foresee
the
end
of
israel
not
a
mere
vague
foreboding
of
evil
that
forced
him
to
leave
his
flocks
the
dark
cloud
that
threatened
on
the
horizon
was
plain
enough
the
assyrians
once
already
at
an
earlier
date
they
had
directed
their
course
without
however
on
that
occasion
becoming
a
source
of
danger
to
the
israelites
but
now
that
the
bulwark
against
the
assyrians
aram
of
damascus
was
falling
into
ruins
a
movement
of
these
against
lebanon
in
the
time
of
jeroboam
ii
opened
to
israel
the
alarming
prospect
that
sooner
or
later
they
would
have
to
meet
the
full
force
of
the
irresistible
avalanche
what
then
the
common
man
was
in
no
position
truly
to
estimate
the
danger
and
so
far
as
he
apprehended
it
he
lived
in
the
firm
faith
that
jehovah
would
not
abandon
his
people
in
their
straits
the
governing
classes
prided
themselves
on
the
military
resources
of
israel
or
otherwise
tried
to
dismiss
from
their
minds
all
thought
of
the
gravity
of
the
situation
but
amos
heard
the
question
distinctly
enough
and
did
not
hesitate
to
answer
it
the
downfall
of
israel
is
imminent
it
was
nothing
short
of
blasphemy
to
utter
anything
of
this
kind
for
everything
jehovah
himself
included
depended
on
the
existence
of
the
nation
but
the
most
astounding
thing
has
yet
to
come
not
asshur
but
jehovah
himself
is
bringing
about
the
overthrow
of
israel
through
asshur
it
is
jehovah
that
is
triumphing
over
israel
a
paradoxical
thought
as
if
the
national
god
were
to
cut
the
ground
from
under
his
own
feet
for
the
faith
in
jehovah
as
the
god
of
israel
was
a
faith
that
he
intervenes
on
behalf
of
his
people
against
all
enemies
against
the
whole
world
precisely
in
times
of
danger
was
religion
shown
by
staying
oneself
upon
this
faith
jehovah
might
indeed
of
course
hide
his
face
for
a
time
but
not
definitively
in
the
end
he
ever
arose
at
last
against
all
opposing
powers
the
day
of
the
lord
was
an
object
of
hope
in
all
times
of
difficulty
and
oppression
it
was
understood
as
that
the
crisis
would
certainly
end
in
favour
of
israel
amos
took
up
the
popular
conception
of
that
day
but
how
thoroughly
did
he
change
its
meaning
woe
to
them
who
long
for
the
day
of
the
lord
what
to
you
is
the
day
of
the
lord
it
is
darkness
not
light
his
own
opposition
to
the
popular
conception
is
formulated
in
a
paradox
which
he
prefixes
as
theme
to
the
principal
section
of
his
book
us
alone
does
jehovah
know
say
the
israelites
drawing
from
this
the
inference
that
he
is
on
their
side
and
of
course
must
take
their
part
you
only
do
i
know
amos
represents
jehovah
as
saying
therefore
do
i
visit
upon
you
all
your
sins
if
the
question
whereon
did
jehovah
relation
to
israel
ultimately
rest
be
asked
the
answer
according
to
the
popular
faith
must
substantially
be
that
it
rested
on
the
fact
that
jehovah
was
worshipped
in
israel
and
not
among
the
heathen
that
in
israel
were
his
altars
and
his
dwelling
his
cultus
was
the
bond
between
him
and
the
nation
when
therefore
it
was
desired
to
draw
the
bond
still
closer
the
solemn
services
of
religion
were
redoubled
but
to
the
conception
of
amos
jehovah
is
no
judge
capable
of
accepting
a
bribe
with
the
utmost
indignation
he
repudiates
the
notion
that
it
is
possible
to
influence
him
by
gifts
and
offerings
though
israel
alone
has
served
him
he
does
not
on
that
account
apply
any
other
standard
to
it
than
to
other
nations
chaps
i
if
israel
is
better
known
to
him
it
does
not
follow
that
on
that
account
he
shuts
his
eyes
and
blindly
takes
a
side
neither
jehovah
nor
his
prophet
recognises
two
moral
standards
right
is
everywhere
right
wrong
always
wrong
even
though
committed
against
israel
worst
enemies
ii
what
jehovah
demands
is
righteousness
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
what
he
hates
is
injustice
sin
or
offence
to
the
deity
is
a
thing
of
purely
moral
character
with
such
emphasis
this
doctrine
had
never
before
been
heard
morality
is
that
for
the
sake
of
which
all
other
things
exist
it
is
the
alone
essential
thing
in
the
world
it
is
no
postulate
no
idea
but
at
once
a
necessity
and
a
fact
the
most
intensely
living
of
personal
the
god
of
hosts
in
wrath
in
ruin
this
holy
reality
makes
its
existence
known
it
annihilates
all
that
is
hollow
and
false
amos
calls
jehovah
the
god
of
hosts
never
the
god
of
israel
the
nation
as
such
is
no
religious
conception
to
him
from
its
mere
existence
he
can
not
formulate
any
article
of
faith
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
he
were
denying
israel
prerogative
altogether
he
does
not
really
do
so
but
at
least
the
prerogative
is
conditional
and
involves
a
heavy
responsibility
the
saying
in
iii
recalls
luke
xii
the
proposition
jehovah
knows
israel
is
in
the
mouth
of
amos
almost
the
same
thing
as
israel
knows
jehovah
save
only
that
this
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
any
merit
on
israel
part
but
as
a
manifestation
of
the
grace
of
jehovah
who
has
led
his
people
by
great
deeds
and
holy
men
and
so
made
himself
known
amos
knows
no
other
truth
than
that
practical
one
which
he
has
found
among
his
own
people
and
nowhere
else
iying
at
the
foundation
of
life
and
morality
and
which
he
regards
as
the
product
of
a
divine
providential
ordering
of
history
from
this
point
of
view
so
thoroughly
israelitish
he
pronounces
israel
condemnation
he
starts
from
premisses
generally
conceded
but
he
accentuates
them
differently
and
draws
from
them
divergent
conclusions
amos
was
the
founder
and
the
purest
type
of
a
new
phase
of
prophecy
the
impending
conflict
of
asshur
with
jehovah
and
israel
the
ultimate
downfall
of
israel
is
its
theme
until
that
date
there
had
subsisted
in
palestine
and
syria
a
number
of
petty
kingdoms
and
nationalities
which
had
their
friendships
and
enmities
with
one
another
but
paid
no
heed
to
anything
outside
their
own
immediate
environment
and
revolved
each
on
its
own
axis
careless
of
the
outside
world
until
suddenly
the
assyrians
burst
in
upon
them
these
commenced
the
work
which
was
carried
on
by
the
babylonians
persians
and
greeks
and
completed
by
the
romans
they
introduced
a
new
factor
the
conception
of
the
world
the
world
of
course
in
the
historical
sense
of
that
expression
in
presence
of
that
conception
the
petty
nationalities
lost
their
centre
of
gravity
brute
fact
dispelled
their
illusions
they
flung
their
gods
to
the
moles
and
to
the
bats
isaiah
the
prophets
of
israel
alone
did
not
allow
themselves
to
be
taken
by
surprise
by
what
had
occurred
or
to
be
plunged
in
despair
they
solved
by
anticipation
the
grim
problem
which
history
set
before
them
they
absorbed
into
their
religion
that
conception
of
the
world
which
was
destroying
the
religions
of
the
nations
even
before
it
had
been
fully
grasped
by
the
secular
consciousness
where
others
saw
only
the
ruin
of
everything
that
is
holiest
they
saw
the
triumph
of
jehovah
over
delusion
and
error
whatever
else
might
be
overthrown
the
really
worthy
remained
unshaken
they
recognised
ideal
powers
only
right
and
wrong
truth
and
falsehood
second
causes
were
matters
of
indifference
to
them
they
were
no
practical
politicians
but
they
watched
the
course
of
events
attentively
nay
with
passionate
interest
the
present
which
was
passing
before
them
became
to
them
as
it
were
the
plot
of
a
divine
drama
which
they
watched
with
an
intelligence
that
anticipated
the
everywhere
the
same
goal
of
the
development
everywhere
the
same
laws
the
nations
are
the
israel
the
hero
jehovah
the
poet
of
the
tragedy
in
very
much
the
same
way
the
threatened
and
actual
political
annihilation
of
ionia
led
to
the
rise
of
greek
philosophy
xenophanes
heraclitus
the
canonical
prophets
the
series
of
whom
begins
with
amos
were
separated
by
an
essential
distinction
from
the
class
which
had
preceded
them
and
which
still
continued
to
be
the
type
of
the
common
prophet
they
did
not
seek
to
kindle
either
the
enthusiasm
or
the
fanaticism
of
the
multitude
they
swam
not
with
but
against
the
stream
they
were
not
patriotic
at
least
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
that
word
they
prophesied
not
good
but
evil
for
their
people
jer
xxviii
until
their
time
the
nation
had
sprung
up
out
of
the
conception
of
jehovah
now
the
conception
of
jehovah
was
casting
the
nation
into
the
shade
the
natural
bond
between
the
two
was
severed
and
the
relation
was
henceforward
viewed
as
conditional
as
god
of
the
righteousness
which
is
the
law
of
the
whole
universe
jehovah
could
be
israel
god
only
in
so
far
as
in
israel
the
right
was
recognised
and
followed
the
ethical
element
destroyed
the
national
character
of
the
old
religion
it
still
addressed
itself
to
be
sure
more
to
the
nation
and
to
society
at
large
than
to
the
individual
it
insisted
less
upon
a
pure
heart
than
upon
righteous
institutions
but
nevertheless
the
first
step
towards
universalism
had
been
accomplished
towards
at
once
the
general
diffusion
and
the
individualisation
of
religion
thus
although
the
prophets
were
far
from
originating
a
new
conception
of
god
they
none
the
less
were
the
founders
of
what
has
been
called
ethical
monotheism
but
with
them
this
ethical
monotheism
was
no
product
of
the
of
dogma
but
a
progressive
step
which
had
been
called
forth
simply
by
the
course
of
events
the
providence
of
god
brought
it
about
that
this
call
came
at
an
opportune
period
and
not
too
suddenly
the
downfall
of
the
nation
did
not
take
place
until
the
truths
and
precepts
of
religion
were
already
strong
enough
to
be
able
to
live
on
alone
to
the
prophets
belongs
the
merit
of
having
recognised
the
independence
of
these
and
of
having
secured
perpetuity
to
israel
by
refusing
to
allow
the
conception
of
jehovah
to
be
involved
in
the
ruin
of
the
kingdom
they
saved
faith
by
destroying
illusion
the
event
which
amos
had
foreseen
was
not
long
in
coming
the
israelites
flew
spontaneously
like
silly
doves
into
the
net
of
the
assyrians
zechariah
ben
jeroboam
was
overthrown
after
a
short
reign
shallum
his
murderer
and
successor
was
also
unable
to
hold
his
own
and
was
followed
after
the
horrors
of
a
civil
war
by
menahem
ben
gadi
but
menahem
in
the
presence
of
domestic
and
perhaps
also
foreign
assailants
had
no
other
it
is
not
inconceivable
that
the
wars
carried
on
by
ii
against
hamath
had
some
connection
with
his
interventions
in
favour
of
menahem
the
kingdom
of
hamath
which
may
have
been
threatened
by
jeroboam
may
have
availed
itself
of
the
state
of
matters
which
followed
his
death
to
secure
its
own
aggrandisement
at
israel
expense
in
correspondence
with
this
attack
from
the
northern
side
another
by
judah
in
concert
with
hamath
may
well
have
been
made
from
the
south
in
this
way
though
not
without
the
aid
of
pure
hypothesis
it
might
be
possible
to
fit
into
the
general
historical
connection
the
fragmentary
assyrian
notices
about
azariah
of
judah
and
his
relations
to
hamath
the
explanations
suggested
by
the
assyriologists
have
hitherto
been
total
failures
but
in
that
case
it
would
certainly
be
necessary
to
assume
that
the
assyrians
were
badly
informed
as
to
the
nature
of
the
relations
between
hamath
and
judah
and
also
as
to
the
individual
who
at
that
time
held
the
throne
of
judah
uzziah
azariah
who
in
his
old
age
had
become
a
leper
could
only
nominally
at
best
have
been
king
of
judah
then
resort
than
to
purchase
by
payment
of
a
great
tribute
the
assistance
of
king
who
at
that
time
was
giving
new
force
to
the
assyrian
predominance
in
these
regions
by
such
means
he
succeeded
in
attaining
his
immediate
end
but
the
further
consequence
was
that
the
rival
party
in
the
state
turned
for
support
to
egypt
and
palestine
now
became
the
arena
of
conflict
between
the
two
great
menahem
transmitted
his
kingdom
to
pekahiah
pekahiah
was
murdered
about
by
pekah
and
pekah
himself
shortly
afterwards
was
overthrown
all
this
happened
within
a
few
years
it
would
have
been
possible
to
conjecture
the
state
of
the
country
in
these
circumstances
even
if
we
had
not
been
informed
of
it
by
means
of
the
prophetical
book
of
hosea
which
dates
from
the
time
when
the
assyrians
had
begun
indeed
to
tamper
with
the
country
but
had
not
yet
shown
their
full
design
after
the
death
of
jeroboam
ii
there
had
been
wild
outbursts
of
partisan
war
none
of
the
kings
who
in
quick
succession
appeared
and
disappeared
had
real
power
none
established
order
it
was
as
if
the
danger
from
without
which
was
only
too
obviously
threatening
the
existence
of
the
kingdom
had
already
dissolved
all
internal
bonds
every
one
was
at
war
with
his
neighbour
assyrians
and
egyptians
were
called
in
to
support
this
or
that
government
by
such
expedients
the
external
confusion
was
naturally
only
increased
was
there
any
other
quarter
in
which
help
could
yet
be
sought
the
people
led
by
the
priests
turned
to
the
altars
of
jehovah
and
outdid
itself
in
pious
works
as
if
by
any
such
illusory
means
out
of
all
relation
to
the
practical
problem
in
hand
the
gangrene
of
anarchy
could
possibly
be
healed
still
more
zealous
than
amos
against
the
cultus
was
hosea
not
merely
on
the
ground
that
it
had
the
absurd
motive
of
forcing
jehovah
favour
but
also
because
it
was
of
heathenish
character
and
idolatry
that
jehovah
is
the
true
and
only
helper
is
certainly
not
denied
by
hosea
but
his
help
is
coupled
with
the
condition
that
israel
shall
undergo
a
complete
change
and
of
such
a
change
he
sees
no
prospect
on
this
account
the
downfall
of
the
state
is
in
hosea
view
inevitable
but
not
final
ruin
only
such
an
overthrow
as
is
necessary
for
the
transition
to
a
new
and
fair
recommencement
in
hosea
prophecies
the
relation
between
jehovah
and
israel
is
conceived
of
as
dissoluble
and
as
actually
on
the
point
of
being
dissolved
but
it
has
struck
its
roots
so
deep
that
it
must
inevitably
at
last
establish
itself
again
the
first
actual
collision
between
israel
and
assyria
occurred
in
resin
king
of
damascus
and
pekah
king
of
samaria
had
united
in
an
expedition
against
judah
where
at
that
time
ahaz
ben
jotham
occupied
the
throne
but
ahaz
parried
the
blow
by
placing
himself
under
the
protection
of
the
assyrians
who
perhaps
would
in
any
case
have
struck
in
against
the
alliance
between
aram
and
israel
made
his
first
appearance
in
first
on
the
of
palestine
and
subsequently
either
in
this
or
in
the
following
year
took
up
his
quarters
in
the
kingdom
of
the
ten
tribes
after
he
had
ravaged
galilee
and
gilead
he
finally
concluded
a
peace
with
samaria
conditionally
on
his
receiving
the
head
of
king
pekah
and
a
considerable
yearly
tribute
hosea
ben
elah
was
raised
to
the
throne
in
pekah
place
and
acknowledged
by
the
assyrian
as
a
vassal
for
some
ten
years
he
held
his
position
quietly
regularly
paying
his
dues
but
when
at
the
death
of
the
kingdoms
rebelled
samaria
also
was
seized
with
the
delirium
of
patriotic
fanaticism
isaiah
relying
upon
the
help
of
seve
king
of
ethiopia
and
egypt
hosea
ventured
on
a
revolt
from
assyria
but
the
egyptians
left
him
in
the
lurch
as
soon
as
shalmaneser
successor
invaded
his
territory
before
his
capital
had
fallen
hosea
himself
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
assyrians
samaria
offered
a
desperate
resistance
and
succumbed
only
to
sargon
shalmaneser
successor
energetic
measures
were
adopted
by
the
victor
for
the
pacification
of
the
country
he
carried
all
the
inhabitants
of
mark
into
captivity
to
calachene
gozanitis
and
armenia
much
light
is
thrown
upon
the
conditions
of
the
national
religion
then
and
upon
its
subsequent
development
by
the
single
fact
that
the
exiled
israelites
were
absorbed
by
the
surrounding
heathenism
without
leaving
a
trace
behind
them
while
the
population
of
judah
who
had
the
benefit
of
a
hundred
years
respite
held
their
faith
fast
throughout
the
period
of
the
babylonian
exile
and
by
means
of
it
were
able
to
maintain
their
own
individuality
afterwards
in
all
the
circumstances
that
arose
the
fact
that
the
fall
of
samaria
did
not
hinder
but
helped
the
religion
of
jehovah
is
entirely
due
to
the
prophets
that
they
had
foreseen
the
downfall
of
the
state
and
declared
in
the
name
of
religion
that
it
was
inevitable
was
a
matter
of
much
greater
historical
importance
than
the
actual
downfall
itself
the
deliverance
of
judah
hitherto
the
small
kingdom
of
judah
had
stood
in
the
background
its
political
history
had
been
determined
almost
exclusively
by
its
relation
to
israel
under
the
dynasty
of
omri
the
original
enmity
had
been
changed
into
a
close
but
perhaps
not
quite
voluntary
friendship
judah
found
itself
drawn
completely
into
the
train
of
the
more
powerful
neighbouring
state
and
seems
even
to
have
rendered
it
military
service
the
fall
of
the
house
of
omri
was
an
ominous
event
for
judah
as
well
as
israel
jehu
as
he
passed
to
the
throne
put
to
death
not
only
ahaziah
the
king
but
also
two
and
forty
other
members
of
the
royal
house
of
david
who
had
fallen
into
his
hands
and
those
who
still
survived
children
for
the
most
part
were
murdered
wholesale
by
the
regent
athaliah
for
reasons
that
are
unknown
only
one
little
boy
joash
was
concealed
from
her
fury
and
by
a
successful
conspiracy
six
years
afterwards
was
placed
upon
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
at
that
time
the
syrians
were
extending
their
incursions
to
judah
and
philistia
and
joash
bought
them
off
from
jerusalem
with
the
temple
treasures
perhaps
it
was
this
disgrace
that
he
expiated
with
his
death
in
like
manner
perhaps
the
assassination
of
his
successor
amaziah
is
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
discredit
he
had
incurred
by
a
reckless
and
unsuccessful
war
against
israel
just
as
israel
was
beginning
to
recover
itself
after
the
happy
termination
of
the
syrian
wars
judah
also
experienced
its
period
of
highest
prosperity
what
jeroboam
ii
was
to
the
northern
kingdom
uzziah
was
to
that
of
the
south
he
appears
to
have
obtained
possession
of
edom
and
for
a
considerable
time
to
have
held
that
one
province
of
conquests
which
fell
to
judah
and
at
the
trading
port
of
elath
he
revived
the
commerce
which
solomon
had
created
the
prosperity
of
his
long
reign
was
uninterrupted
till
in
his
later
years
he
was
smitten
with
leprosy
and
found
it
necessary
to
hand
over
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
to
his
son
jotham
but
jotham
appears
to
have
died
about
the
same
time
as
his
father
his
successor
still
in
very
early
youth
isaiah
iii
being
ahaz
ben
jotham
ben
uzziah
if
judah
could
not
compare
with
israel
in
political
and
general
historical
importance
it
nevertheless
enjoyed
more
than
one
considerable
advantage
over
the
larger
kingdom
it
was
much
safer
from
foreign
foes
for
the
egyptians
as
a
rule
were
not
dangerous
neighbours
but
its
chief
advantage
consisted
in
the
stability
of
its
dynasty
it
was
david
who
had
elevated
judah
and
jerusalem
to
a
position
of
historical
significance
and
the
prosperity
of
his
house
was
most
intimately
connected
with
that
of
the
town
and
territory
and
even
with
that
of
religion
on
two
separate
occasions
it
occurred
that
a
king
of
judah
was
murdered
by
subjects
but
in
both
cases
the
people
of
the
land
rose
up
against
the
assassins
and
once
more
placed
a
member
of
the
davidic
family
upon
the
throne
the
one
actual
recorded
revolution
was
that
against
athaliah
which
had
for
its
object
the
restoration
of
the
throne
to
the
legitimate
heir
under
shelter
of
the
monarchy
the
other
institutions
of
the
state
also
acquired
a
measure
of
permanency
such
as
was
not
found
at
all
in
israel
where
everything
depended
on
the
character
of
individuals
and
the
existing
order
of
things
was
ever
liable
to
be
subjected
to
fresh
dispute
life
in
judah
was
a
much
more
stable
affair
though
not
so
exciting
or
dramatic
possibly
the
greater
isolation
of
the
little
kingdom
its
more
intimate
relations
with
the
neighbouring
wilderness
and
the
more
primitive
modes
of
life
which
resulted
were
also
factors
which
contributed
to
this
general
result
in
the
capital
of
course
the
life
was
not
primitive
and
its
influence
was
undoubtedly
greater
than
that
of
the
country
successive
kings
exerted
themselves
for
its
external
improvement
and
in
this
respect
hezekiah
ben
ahaz
was
specially
distinguished
above
all
they
manifested
sincere
interest
in
the
temple
which
from
an
early
period
exerted
a
powerful
force
of
attraction
over
the
entire
mass
of
the
population
they
regulated
the
cultus
according
to
their
individual
tastes
added
to
it
or
curtailed
it
at
their
pleasure
and
dealt
with
the
sacred
treasures
as
they
chose
although
the
priests
had
in
a
certain
sense
great
power
the
conspiracy
against
athaliah
was
led
not
by
a
prophet
but
by
a
priest
they
were
nevertheless
subjects
of
the
king
and
had
to
act
according
to
his
orders
that
the
cultus
of
jehovah
at
jerusalem
was
purer
than
that
at
bethel
or
at
samaria
is
an
assertion
which
is
contradicted
by
more
than
one
fact
in
this
respect
there
was
no
essential
difference
between
israel
and
judah
it
was
in
israel
that
the
reaction
against
originated
which
afterwards
passed
over
into
judah
the
initiative
in
all
such
matters
was
israel
there
the
experiments
were
made
from
which
jerusalem
learned
the
lesson
how
deep
was
the
interest
felt
in
the
affairs
of
the
larger
kingdom
by
the
inhabitants
even
of
one
of
the
smaller
provincial
towns
of
judah
is
shown
in
the
instance
of
amos
of
tekoah
step
by
step
with
the
decline
of
israel
after
the
death
of
jeroboam
ii
did
judah
rise
in
importance
it
was
already
preparing
to
take
the
inheritance
the
man
through
whom
the
transition
of
the
history
from
israel
to
judah
was
effected
and
who
was
the
means
of
securing
for
the
latter
kingdom
a
period
of
respite
which
was
fruitful
of
the
best
results
for
the
consolidation
of
true
religion
was
the
prophet
isaiah
the
history
of
his
activity
is
at
the
same
time
the
history
of
judah
during
that
period
isaiah
became
conscious
of
his
vocation
in
the
year
of
king
uzziah
death
his
earliest
discourses
date
from
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
ahaz
in
them
he
contemplates
the
imminent
downfall
of
samaria
and
threatens
judah
also
with
the
chastisement
its
political
and
social
sins
deserve
in
chapter
and
also
in
chapters
he
still
confines
himself
on
the
whole
to
generalities
quite
after
the
manner
of
amos
but
on
the
occasion
of
the
expedition
of
the
allied
syrians
and
ephraimites
against
jerusalem
he
interposed
with
bold
decision
in
the
sphere
of
practical
politics
to
the
very
last
he
endeavoured
to
restrain
ahaz
from
his
purpose
of
summoning
the
assyrians
to
his
help
he
assured
him
of
jehovah
countenance
and
offered
him
a
token
in
pledge
when
the
king
refused
this
the
prophet
recognised
that
matters
had
gone
too
far
and
that
the
coming
of
the
assyrians
could
not
be
averted
he
then
declared
that
the
dreaded
danger
would
indeed
be
obviated
by
that
course
but
that
another
far
more
serious
would
be
incurred
for
the
egyptians
would
resist
the
westward
movement
of
assyria
and
judah
as
the
field
of
war
would
be
utterly
laid
waste
only
a
remnant
would
remain
as
the
basis
of
a
better
future
the
actual
issue
however
was
not
yet
quite
so
disastrous
the
egyptians
did
not
interfere
with
the
assyrians
and
left
samaria
and
damascus
to
their
fate
judah
became
indeed
tributary
to
assyria
but
at
the
same
time
enjoyed
considerable
prosperity
henceforward
the
prophet
most
zealous
efforts
were
directed
to
the
object
of
securing
the
maintenance
at
any
price
of
this
condition
of
affairs
he
sought
by
every
means
at
his
command
to
keep
judah
from
any
sort
of
intervention
in
the
politics
of
the
great
powers
in
order
that
it
might
devote
itself
with
undivided
energies
to
the
necessities
of
internal
affairs
he
actually
succeeded
in
maintaining
the
peace
for
many
years
even
at
times
when
in
the
petty
kingdoms
around
the
spirit
of
revolt
was
abroad
the
ill
success
of
all
attempts
elsewhere
to
shake
off
the
yoke
confirmed
him
in
the
conviction
that
assyria
was
the
rod
of
chastisement
wielded
by
jehovah
over
the
nations
who
had
no
alternative
but
to
yield
to
its
iron
sway
while
thirty
years
passed
thus
peacefully
away
so
far
as
foreign
relations
were
concerned
internal
changes
of
all
the
greater
importance
were
taking
place
hezekiah
ben
ahaz
undertook
for
the
first
time
a
thoroughgoing
reformation
in
the
cultus
of
jehovah
he
removed
the
high
places
and
brake
the
pillars
and
cut
down
the
ashera
and
brake
in
pieces
the
brazen
serpent
that
moses
had
made
so
we
are
told
in
xviii
with
a
mixture
of
the
general
and
the
special
that
does
not
inspire
much
confidence
for
the
high
places
which
solomon
had
raised
on
the
mount
of
olives
were
not
removed
by
hezekiah
although
they
stood
quite
close
to
jerusalem
and
moreover
were
consecrated
to
foreign
deities
but
in
every
respect
there
must
have
been
a
wide
difference
between
the
objects
and
results
of
the
reformations
of
hezekiah
and
josiah
undoubtedly
hezekiah
undertook
his
reforms
in
worship
under
the
influence
of
isaiah
following
in
the
footsteps
of
hosea
who
had
been
the
first
to
take
and
to
express
offence
at
the
use
of
images
in
the
worship
of
jehovah
this
prophet
utilising
the
impression
which
the
destruction
of
samaria
had
produced
in
jerusalem
isaiah
cf
jeremiah
iii
strove
to
the
utmost
against
the
adoration
of
the
work
of
men
hands
in
the
holy
places
against
the
asheras
and
pillars
and
above
all
against
the
ephods
the
idols
of
silver
and
gold
of
which
the
land
was
full
but
against
the
high
places
in
and
by
themselves
against
the
multiplicity
of
the
altars
of
jehovah
he
made
no
protest
in
the
messianic
time
ye
shall
loathe
and
cast
away
as
an
unclean
thing
your
graven
images
with
silver
coverings
and
your
molten
images
overlaid
with
gold
he
says
xxx
and
the
inference
is
that
he
contemplated
the
purification
of
the
high
places
from
superstitious
excesses
but
by
no
means
their
abolition
to
this
one
object
that
is
to
the
abolition
of
the
images
jeremiah
polemic
is
directed
no
longer
against
the
images
but
against
wood
and
stone
asheras
and
pillars
the
date
of
the
reformation
under
hezekiah
is
uncertain
perhaps
it
ought
to
be
placed
after
sennacherib
withdrawal
from
jerusalem
hezekiah
reformation
seems
to
have
confined
itself
an
object
of
much
greater
primary
importance
than
the
destruction
of
the
altars
themselves
their
destruction
was
a
measure
which
arose
simply
out
of
despair
of
the
possibility
of
cleansing
them
sargon
king
of
assyria
was
succeeded
in
by
sennacherib
the
opportunity
was
seized
by
merodach
baladan
of
babylon
to
secure
his
independence
and
by
means
of
an
embassy
he
urged
hezekiah
also
to
throw
off
the
yoke
the
proposal
was
adopted
and
the
king
of
judah
was
joined
by
other
petty
kingdoms
especially
some
of
the
philistine
towns
relations
with
egypt
were
established
to
secure
its
support
in
case
of
need
more
immediate
and
pressing
business
in
babylon
enabled
palestine
to
gain
some
time
but
the
issue
of
that
revolt
made
impossible
as
to
the
probable
result
of
the
other
movement
this
was
the
period
at
which
isaiah
already
far
advanced
in
life
wielded
his
greatest
influence
the
preparations
for
revolt
the
negotiations
with
egypt
were
concealed
from
him
proof
how
greatly
he
was
feared
at
court
when
he
came
to
know
of
them
it
was
already
too
late
to
undo
what
had
been
done
but
he
could
at
least
give
vent
to
his
anger
with
jerusalem
it
seemed
to
him
the
story
of
samaria
was
repeating
itself
uninstructed
by
that
sad
lesson
the
capital
was
giving
itself
up
to
the
mad
intoxication
of
leaders
who
would
inevitably
bring
her
to
ruin
quietness
and
rest
had
been
the
motto
given
by
jehovah
to
judah
powerless
as
it
was
and
much
in
need
of
a
period
of
peace
instead
of
this
defiance
based
on
ignorance
and
falsehood
expressed
the
prevailing
temper
but
those
who
refused
to
listen
to
the
intelligible
language
of
jehovah
would
be
compelled
to
hear
him
speak
in
assyrian
speech
in
a
way
that
would
deafen
and
blind
them
isaiah
shows
himself
no
less
indignant
against
the
crowd
that
stupidly
stared
at
his
excitement
than
against
the
folly
of
the
king
with
his
counsellors
his
priests
and
his
prophets
they
do
not
suffer
themselves
to
be
shaken
out
of
their
ordinary
routine
by
the
gravity
of
such
a
crisis
as
this
the
living
work
of
jehovah
is
to
them
a
sealed
book
their
piety
does
not
extend
beyond
the
respect
they
show
for
certain
human
precepts
learnt
by
rote
meanwhile
sennacherib
at
the
head
of
a
great
army
was
advancing
against
philistia
and
judah
along
the
phoenician
coast
having
captured
ascalon
he
next
laid
siege
to
ekron
which
after
the
combined
egyptian
and
ethiopian
army
sent
to
its
relief
had
been
defeated
at
eltheke
fell
into
the
enemy
hand
and
was
severely
dealt
with
simultaneously
various
fortresses
of
judah
were
occupied
and
the
level
country
was
devastated
isaiah
the
consequence
was
that
hezekiah
in
a
state
of
panic
offered
to
the
assyrians
his
which
was
accepted
on
payment
of
a
heavy
penalty
he
being
permitted
however
to
retain
possession
of
jerusalem
he
seemed
to
have
got
cheaply
off
from
the
unequal
contest
the
way
being
thus
cleared
sennacherib
pressed
on
southwards
for
the
egyptians
were
collecting
their
forces
against
him
the
nearer
he
came
to
the
enemy
the
more
undesirable
did
he
find
it
that
he
should
leave
in
his
rear
so
important
a
fortress
as
jerusalem
in
the
hands
of
a
doubtful
vassal
notwithstanding
the
recently
ratified
treaty
therefore
he
demanded
the
surrender
of
the
city
believing
that
a
policy
of
intimidation
would
be
enough
to
secure
it
from
hezekiah
but
there
was
another
personality
in
jerusalem
of
whom
his
plans
had
taken
no
account
isaiah
had
indeed
regarded
the
revolt
from
assyria
as
a
rebellion
against
jehovah
himself
and
therefore
as
a
perfectly
hopeless
undertaking
which
could
only
result
in
the
utmost
humiliation
and
sternest
chastisement
for
judah
but
still
more
distinctly
than
those
who
had
gone
before
him
did
he
hold
firm
as
an
article
of
faith
the
conviction
that
the
kingdom
would
not
be
utterly
annihilated
all
his
speeches
of
solemn
warning
closed
with
the
announcement
that
a
remnant
should
return
and
form
the
kernel
of
a
new
commonwealth
to
be
fashioned
after
jehovah
own
heart
for
him
in
contrast
to
amos
the
great
crisis
had
a
positive
character
in
contrast
to
hosea
he
did
not
expect
a
temporary
suspension
of
the
theocracy
to
be
followed
by
its
complete
reconstruction
but
in
the
pious
and
individuals
who
were
still
to
be
met
with
in
this
sodom
of
iniquity
he
saw
the
threads
thin
indeed
yet
sufficient
which
formed
the
links
between
the
israel
of
the
present
and
its
better
future
over
against
the
vain
confidence
of
the
multitude
isaiah
had
hitherto
brought
into
prominence
the
darker
obverse
of
his
religious
belief
but
now
he
confronted
their
present
depression
with
its
bright
reverse
was
still
more
alien
to
his
nature
than
temerity
in
the
name
of
jehovah
he
bade
king
hezekiah
be
of
good
courage
and
urged
that
he
should
by
no
means
surrender
the
assyrians
would
not
be
able
to
take
the
city
not
even
to
shoot
an
arrow
into
it
nor
to
bring
up
their
siege
train
against
it
i
know
thy
sitting
thy
going
and
thy
standing
is
jehovah
language
to
the
assyrian
and
also
thy
rage
against
me
and
i
will
put
my
ring
in
thy
nose
and
my
bridle
in
thy
lips
and
i
will
turn
thee
back
by
the
way
by
which
thou
camest
and
thus
it
proved
in
the
issue
by
a
still
unexplained
catastrophe
the
main
army
of
sennacherib
was
annihilated
on
the
frontier
between
egypt
and
palestine
and
jerusalem
thereby
freed
from
all
danger
the
assyrian
king
had
to
save
himself
by
a
hurried
retreat
to
nineveh
isaiah
was
triumphant
a
more
magnificent
close
of
a
period
of
influential
public
life
can
hardly
be
imagined
what
sennacherib
himself
relates
of
his
expedition
against
his
rebellious
vassals
in
palestine
george
smith
assyrian
eponym
canon
runs
parallel
with
kings
xviii
but
not
with
the
rest
of
the
bible
narrative
these
three
verses
are
peculiar
and
their
source
is
different
from
that
of
the
context
after
having
captured
various
phoenician
cities
and
received
tribute
from
a
number
of
kings
his
first
measure
is
forcibly
to
restore
the
assyrian
governor
who
had
been
expelled
from
ascalon
and
next
he
turns
his
arms
against
ekron
this
city
had
put
in
irons
its
own
king
padi
who
remained
loyal
to
the
suzerain
and
handed
him
over
to
hezekiah
who
appears
as
the
soul
of
the
rebellion
in
these
quarters
the
egyptians
who
as
usual
have
a
hand
in
the
matter
advance
with
an
army
for
the
relief
of
the
beleaguered
city
but
are
defeated
near
eltheke
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
ekron
is
taken
remorselessly
chastised
and
forced
to
take
padi
back
again
as
its
king
for
hezekiah
in
the
meantime
has
delivered
up
his
prisoner
and
terrified
by
the
fall
of
his
fortresses
and
the
devastation
of
his
territory
has
accepted
the
position
of
a
vassal
once
more
paying
at
the
same
time
a
heavy
fine
inclusive
of
talents
of
gold
and
of
silver
such
is
the
assyrian
account
if
we
treat
the
talents
mentioned
in
xviii
as
syrian
babylonian
it
completely
fills
in
the
vague
outlines
given
in
xviii
and
while
confirming
in
their
place
immediately
after
ver
these
verses
unrelated
as
they
are
to
the
main
connection
of
the
biblical
narrative
corrects
them
only
in
one
point
by
making
it
probable
that
the
subjection
of
hezekiah
which
is
not
equivalent
to
the
surrender
of
his
city
took
place
while
sennacherib
was
still
before
ekron
and
not
at
later
date
when
he
had
gone
further
south
towards
libnah
as
regards
his
further
advance
towards
egypt
and
the
reasons
of
his
sudden
withdrawal
related
by
herodotus
also
from
egyptian
tradition
the
great
king
is
silent
having
nothing
to
boast
of
in
it
the
battle
of
eltheke
which
is
to
be
regarded
only
as
an
episode
in
the
siege
of
ekron
being
merely
the
repulse
of
the
egyptian
relieving
army
was
not
an
event
of
great
historical
importance
and
ought
not
to
be
brought
into
any
connection
either
with
xix
or
with
xix
sennacherib
inscription
speaks
only
of
the
first
and
prosperous
stage
of
the
expedition
not
of
the
decisive
one
which
resulted
so
disastrously
for
him
as
must
be
clear
from
the
words
themselves
to
every
unprejudiced
reader
the
prophetic
reformation
isaiah
was
so
completely
a
prophet
that
even
his
wife
was
called
the
prophetess
after
him
no
such
title
could
have
been
bestowed
on
the
wife
of
either
amos
or
hosea
but
what
distinguished
him
more
than
anything
else
from
those
predecessors
was
that
his
position
was
not
like
theirs
apart
from
the
government
he
sat
close
to
the
helm
and
took
a
very
real
part
in
directing
the
course
of
the
vessel
he
was
more
positive
and
practical
than
they
he
wished
to
make
his
influence
felt
and
when
for
the
moment
he
was
unsuccessful
in
this
so
far
as
the
great
whole
of
the
state
was
concerned
he
busied
himself
in
gathering
round
him
a
small
circle
of
persons
on
whom
his
hope
for
the
future
rested
now
that
israel
had
been
destroyed
he
wished
at
all
events
to
save
judah
the
lofty
ideality
of
his
faith
ii
seq
did
not
hinder
him
from
calling
in
the
aid
of
practical
means
for
this
end
but
the
current
of
his
activities
was
by
the
circumstances
of
the
case
directed
into
a
channel
in
which
after
his
death
they
continued
to
flow
towards
a
goal
which
had
hardly
been
contemplated
by
himself
the
political
importance
of
the
people
of
jehovah
was
reduced
to
a
minimum
when
judah
only
was
left
already
at
an
earlier
period
in
that
kingdom
the
sacred
had
come
to
be
of
more
importance
than
the
secular
much
more
was
this
the
case
under
the
suzerainty
of
assyria
the
circumstances
of
the
time
themselves
urged
that
the
religion
of
israel
should
divest
itself
of
all
character
but
isaiah
also
did
his
best
to
further
this
end
it
was
his
most
zealous
endeavour
to
hold
king
and
people
aloof
from
every
patriotic
movement
to
him
the
true
religious
attitude
was
one
of
quietness
and
sitting
still
in
political
affairs
concentration
on
the
problems
of
internal
government
but
he
was
compelled
to
leave
over
for
the
coming
messiah
xi
seq
that
reformation
in
legal
and
social
matters
which
seemed
to
him
so
necessary
all
that
he
could
bring
the
secular
rulers
of
his
country
to
undertake
was
a
reform
in
worship
this
was
the
most
easily
solved
of
the
problems
alluded
to
above
and
it
was
also
that
which
most
closely
corresponded
to
the
character
of
the
kingdom
of
judah
thus
it
came
about
that
the
reform
of
the
theocracy
which
had
been
contemplated
by
isaiah
led
to
its
transformation
into
an
ecclesiastical
state
no
less
influential
in
effecting
a
radical
change
in
the
old
popular
religion
was
isaiah
doctrine
which
identified
the
true
israel
with
the
holy
remnant
which
alone
should
emerge
from
the
crisis
unconsumed
for
that
remnant
was
more
than
a
mere
object
of
hope
it
actually
stood
before
him
in
the
persons
of
that
little
group
of
pious
individuals
gathered
around
him
isaiah
founded
no
ecclesiola
in
ecclesia
indeed
but
certainly
an
ecclesia
in
civitate
dei
now
began
that
distinction
between
the
true
israel
and
the
israel
according
to
the
flesh
that
bipartite
division
of
the
nation
which
became
so
important
in
later
times
as
head
and
founder
of
the
prophetic
party
in
judah
isaiah
was
involuntarily
the
man
who
took
the
first
steps
towards
the
institution
of
the
church
the
catastrophe
which
befell
the
army
of
sennacherib
had
no
very
great
effect
upon
the
external
affairs
of
judah
sennacherib
indeed
being
busy
in
the
east
was
unable
to
retrieve
the
loss
he
had
sustained
but
his
son
esarhaddon
who
succeeded
him
in
resumed
the
egyptian
war
with
better
success
he
made
himself
master
of
the
nile
valley
and
brought
the
ethiopians
into
submission
that
the
petty
kingdoms
of
palestine
returned
to
the
old
relations
of
dependence
is
to
be
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
judah
appears
to
have
resumed
the
yoke
voluntarily
but
the
samaritans
only
after
force
had
been
applied
they
were
afterwards
deported
whereupon
the
deserted
country
was
occupied
by
foreign
colonists
who
however
accepted
the
cultus
of
the
god
of
the
land
that
manasseh
ben
hezekiah
should
have
again
come
under
assyrian
suzerainty
appears
at
that
time
to
have
made
but
little
impression
since
the
time
of
ahaz
judah
had
been
accustomed
to
this
relation
the
book
of
kings
speaks
only
of
internal
affairs
under
the
reign
of
manasseh
according
to
it
he
was
a
bad
ruler
who
permitted
and
even
caused
innocent
blood
to
flow
like
water
but
what
was
of
greater
consequence
for
the
future
he
took
up
an
attitude
of
hostility
towards
the
prophetic
party
of
reform
and
put
himself
on
the
side
of
the
reaction
which
would
fain
bring
back
to
the
place
of
honour
the
old
popular
conception
of
jehovah
as
against
the
pure
and
holy
god
whom
the
prophets
worshipped
the
revulsion
manifested
itself
as
the
reform
had
done
chiefly
in
matters
of
worship
the
old
idolatrous
furniture
of
the
sanctuaries
was
reinstated
in
its
place
and
new
frippery
was
imported
from
all
quarters
especially
from
assyria
and
babylon
to
renovate
the
old
religion
with
jehovah
was
now
associated
a
queen
of
heaven
yet
as
usual
the
restoration
did
more
than
merely
bring
back
the
old
order
of
things
what
at
an
earlier
period
had
been
mere
naivete
now
became
superstition
and
could
hold
its
ground
only
by
having
imparted
to
it
artificially
a
deeper
meaning
which
was
itself
borrowed
from
the
prophetical
circle
of
ideas
again
earnestness
superseded
the
old
joyousness
of
the
cultus
this
now
had
reference
principally
to
sin
and
its
atonement
value
was
attached
to
services
rendered
to
the
deity
just
in
proportion
to
their
hardness
and
unnaturalness
at
this
period
it
was
that
the
old
precept
to
sacrifice
to
jehovah
the
male
that
opens
the
matrix
was
extended
to
children
the
reformation
was
far
from
being
unaffected
by
the
preceding
reformation
although
it
understood
religious
earnestness
in
quite
another
sense
and
sought
not
to
eliminate
heathenism
from
the
cultus
but
to
animate
it
with
new
life
on
the
other
hand
the
reaction
was
in
the
end
found
to
have
left
distinct
traces
of
its
influence
in
the
ultimate
issue
of
the
reformation
we
possess
one
document
dating
from
manasseh
time
in
micah
vi
vii
here
where
the
lawlessness
and
utter
disregard
of
every
moral
restraint
in
judah
are
set
in
a
hideous
light
the
prophetic
point
of
view
as
contrasted
with
the
new
refinements
in
worship
attains
also
its
simplest
and
purest
expression
perhaps
to
this
period
the
decalogue
also
which
is
so
eloquently
silent
in
regard
to
cultus
is
to
be
assigned
jehovah
demands
nothing
for
himself
all
that
he
asks
is
only
for
men
this
is
here
the
fundamental
law
of
the
theocracy
manasseh
life
was
a
long
one
and
his
son
amon
walked
in
his
ways
the
latter
died
after
a
brief
reign
and
with
his
death
a
new
era
for
judah
began
it
was
introduced
by
the
great
catastrophe
in
which
the
assyrian
empire
came
to
an
end
the
sovereignty
of
the
world
was
beginning
to
pass
out
of
the
hands
of
the
semites
into
those
of
the
aryans
phraortes
of
media
indeed
was
unsuccessful
in
his
attempt
against
the
assyrians
but
cyaxares
beat
them
and
proceeded
to
besiege
their
capital
the
scythian
invasion
of
media
and
western
asia
at
this
juncture
gave
them
another
respite
of
more
than
twenty
years
but
even
it
tended
to
break
in
pieces
the
great
monarchy
the
provinces
became
gradually
disintegrated
and
the
kingdom
shrivelled
up
till
it
covered
no
more
than
the
land
of
asshur
our
knowledge
of
the
events
of
the
second
half
of
the
century
has
remained
singularly
imperfect
hitherto
notwithstanding
the
importance
of
the
changes
they
wrought
on
the
face
of
the
ancient
world
the
account
given
above
is
that
of
herodotus
i
and
there
the
matter
must
rest
until
really
authentic
sources
shall
have
been
brought
to
light
with
regard
to
the
final
siege
of
nineveh
our
chief
informant
is
ctesias
as
quoted
by
diodorus
ii
whether
the
prophecy
of
nabum
relates
to
the
last
siege
is
doubtful
in
spite
of
ii
and
the
oracle
given
in
diodorus
oti
thn
oudeis
elei
kata
kratos
ean
mh
proteron
o
potamos
polei
genhtai
polemos
inasmuch
as
nahum
i
expressly
speaks
of
the
siege
alluded
to
by
him
as
the
first
saying
the
trouble
shall
not
rise
up
the
second
time
the
inroad
of
the
scythians
aroused
to
energy
again
the
voice
of
prophecy
which
had
been
dumb
during
the
very
sinful
but
not
very
animated
period
of
manasseh
reign
zephaniah
and
jeremiah
threatened
with
the
mysterious
northern
foe
just
as
amos
and
hosea
had
formerly
done
with
the
assyrians
the
scythians
actually
did
invade
palestine
in
the
year
of
josiah
and
penetrated
as
far
as
to
egypt
but
their
course
lay
along
the
shore
line
and
they
left
judah
untouched
this
danger
that
had
come
so
near
and
yet
passed
them
by
this
instance
of
a
prophetic
threatening
that
had
come
to
pass
and
yet
been
mercifully
averted
made
a
powerful
impression
upon
the
people
of
judah
public
opinion
went
through
a
revolution
in
favour
of
the
reforming
party
which
was
able
to
gain
for
itself
the
support
also
of
the
young
king
josiah
ben
amon
the
circumstances
were
favourable
for
coming
forward
with
a
comprehensive
programme
for
a
reconstruction
of
the
theocracy
in
the
year
the
eighteenth
of
josiah
deuteronomy
was
discovered
accepted
and
carried
into
effect
the
deuteronomic
legislation
is
designed
for
the
reformation
by
no
means
of
the
cultus
alone
but
at
least
quite
as
much
of
the
civil
relations
of
life
the
social
interest
is
placed
above
the
cultus
inasmuch
as
everywhere
humane
ends
are
assigned
for
the
rites
and
offerings
in
this
it
is
plainly
seen
that
deuteronomy
is
the
progeny
of
the
prophetic
spirit
still
more
plainly
does
this
appear
in
the
of
the
legislation
according
to
these
jehovah
is
the
only
god
whose
service
demands
the
whole
heart
and
every
energy
he
has
entered
into
a
covenant
with
israel
but
upon
fundamental
conditions
that
as
contained
in
the
decalogue
are
purely
moral
and
of
absolute
universality
nowhere
does
the
fundamental
religious
thought
of
prophecy
find
clearer
expression
than
in
deuteronomy
the
thought
that
jehovah
asks
nothing
for
himself
but
asks
it
as
a
religious
duty
that
man
should
render
to
man
what
is
right
that
his
will
lies
not
in
any
unknown
height
but
in
the
moral
sphere
which
is
known
and
understood
by
all
the
commandments
which
i
command
thee
are
not
unattainable
for
thee
neither
are
they
far
off
not
in
heaven
so
that
one
might
say
who
can
climb
up
into
heaven
and
bring
them
down
and
tell
us
them
that
we
might
do
them
not
beyond
the
sea
so
that
one
might
say
who
shall
go
over
the
sea
and
fetch
them
and
tell
us
them
that
we
might
do
them
but
the
matter
lies
very
near
thee
in
thy
mouth
and
in
thy
heart
so
that
thou
canst
do
it
deut
xxx
but
the
result
of
the
innovation
did
not
correspond
exactly
to
its
prophetic
origin
prophecy
died
when
its
precepts
attained
to
the
force
of
laws
the
prophetic
ideas
lost
their
purity
when
they
became
practical
whatever
may
have
been
contemplated
only
provisional
regulations
actually
admitted
of
being
carried
and
even
these
only
in
with
the
king
and
the
priests
and
with
due
regard
to
the
capacity
of
the
masses
the
final
outcome
of
the
deuteronomic
reformation
was
principally
that
the
cultus
of
jehovah
was
limited
to
jerusalem
and
abolished
everywhere
else
such
was
the
popular
and
practical
form
of
prophetic
monotheism
the
importance
of
the
salomonic
temple
was
thereby
increased
in
the
highest
degree
and
so
also
the
influence
of
the
priests
of
jerusalem
the
sons
of
zadok
who
now
in
point
of
fact
got
rid
entirely
of
their
rivals
the
priests
of
the
country
districts
jeremiah
and
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
josiah
lived
for
thirteen
years
after
the
accomplishment
of
his
great
work
it
was
a
happy
period
of
external
and
internal
prosperity
the
nation
possessed
the
covenant
and
kept
it
it
seemed
as
if
the
conditions
had
been
attained
on
which
according
to
the
prophets
the
continuance
of
the
theocracy
depended
if
their
threatenings
against
israel
had
been
fulfilled
so
now
was
judah
proving
itself
the
heir
of
their
promises
already
in
deuteronomy
is
the
extension
of
the
frontier
taken
into
consideration
and
josiah
actually
put
his
hand
to
the
task
of
seeking
the
attainment
of
this
end
jehovah
and
israel
religion
and
patriotism
once
more
went
hand
in
hand
jeremiah
alone
did
not
suffer
himself
to
be
misled
by
the
general
feeling
he
was
a
second
amos
upon
a
higher
platform
but
unlike
his
predecessor
a
prophet
by
profession
his
history
like
isaiah
is
practically
the
history
of
his
time
in
the
work
of
introducing
deuteronomy
he
had
taken
an
active
part
and
throughout
his
life
he
showed
his
zeal
against
unlawful
altars
and
against
the
adoration
of
wood
and
stone
asheras
and
pillars
but
he
was
by
no
means
satisfied
with
the
efforts
of
the
reformation
that
had
been
effected
nothing
appeared
to
him
more
sinful
or
more
silly
than
the
false
confidence
produced
by
it
in
jehovah
and
in
the
inviolability
of
his
one
true
temple
this
confidence
he
maintained
to
be
delusive
judah
was
not
a
whit
better
than
israel
had
been
jerusalem
would
be
destroyed
one
day
like
the
temple
of
shiloh
the
external
improvements
on
which
the
people
of
judah
prided
themselves
he
held
to
leave
this
severe
judgment
unaffected
what
was
needed
was
a
quite
different
sort
of
change
a
change
of
heart
not
very
easy
positively
to
define
an
opportunity
for
showing
his
opposition
presented
itself
to
the
prophet
at
the
juncture
when
king
josiah
had
fallen
at
megiddo
in
the
battle
with
pharaoh
necho
and
when
the
people
were
seeking
safety
and
protection
by
cleaving
to
jehovah
and
his
holy
temple
at
the
instance
of
the
priests
and
the
prophets
he
had
almost
expiated
with
his
blood
the
blasphemies
he
had
uttered
against
the
popular
belief
but
he
did
not
suffer
himself
to
be
driven
from
his
course
even
when
the
times
had
grown
quiet
again
he
persisted
at
the
risk
of
his
life
and
under
universal
reproach
and
ridicule
in
his
work
as
a
prophet
of
evil
moments
of
despair
sometimes
came
to
him
but
that
he
had
correctly
estimated
the
true
value
of
the
great
conversion
of
the
nation
was
speedily
proved
by
the
facts
although
deuteronomy
was
not
formally
abolished
under
jehoiakim
who
as
the
vassal
of
egypt
ascended
the
throne
of
his
father
josiah
nevertheless
it
ceased
to
have
practical
weight
the
battle
of
megiddo
having
shown
that
in
spite
of
the
covenant
with
jehovah
the
possibilities
of
in
war
remained
the
same
as
before
jehoiakim
tended
to
return
to
the
ways
of
manasseh
not
only
as
regarded
idolatry
but
also
in
his
contempt
for
law
and
the
private
rights
of
his
subjects
the
two
things
seem
to
stand
in
connection
the
course
of
events
at
last
brought
upon
the
theocracy
the
visible
ruin
which
jeremiah
had
been
so
long
expecting
after
the
egyptians
had
with
comparative
ease
subjugated
syria
at
the
time
when
the
medes
and
chaldaeans
were
busied
with
the
siege
of
nineveh
nebuchadnezzar
that
task
accomplished
came
upon
them
from
babylon
and
routed
them
on
the
euphrates
near
carchemish
the
people
of
judah
rejoiced
at
the
fall
of
nineveh
and
also
at
the
result
of
carchemish
but
they
were
soon
undeceived
when
the
prospect
began
to
open
on
them
of
simply
exchanging
the
egyptian
for
the
chaldaean
yoke
the
power
of
the
chaldaeans
had
been
quite
unsuspected
and
now
it
was
found
that
in
them
the
assyrians
had
suddenly
returned
to
life
jeremiah
was
the
only
man
who
gained
any
credit
by
these
events
his
much
ridiculed
enemy
out
of
the
north
of
whom
he
had
of
old
been
wont
to
speak
so
much
now
began
to
be
talked
of
with
respect
although
his
name
was
no
longer
the
scythian
but
the
babylonian
it
was
an
epoch
the
close
of
an
account
which
balanced
in
his
favour
therefore
it
was
that
precisely
at
this
moment
he
received
the
divine
command
to
commit
to
writing
that
which
for
years
he
had
been
preaching
and
which
ever
pronounced
impossible
had
now
showed
itself
so
close
at
hand
after
the
victory
of
carchemish
the
chaldaeans
drove
pharaoh
out
of
syria
and
also
compelled
the
submission
of
jehoiakim
for
three
years
he
continued
to
pay
his
tribute
and
then
he
withheld
it
a
mad
passion
for
liberty
kindled
by
religious
fanaticism
had
begun
to
rage
with
portentous
power
amongst
the
influential
classes
the
grandees
the
priests
and
the
prophets
nebuchadnezzar
satisfied
himself
in
the
first
instance
with
raising
against
judah
several
of
the
smaller
nationalities
around
especially
the
edomites
not
till
did
he
appear
in
person
before
jerusalem
the
town
was
compelled
to
yield
the
more
important
citizens
were
carried
into
exile
amongst
them
the
young
king
jechoniah
son
of
jehoiakim
who
had
died
in
the
interval
zedekiah
ben
josiah
was
made
king
in
his
stead
over
the
remnant
left
behind
the
patriotic
fanaticism
that
had
led
to
the
revolt
was
not
broken
even
by
this
blow
within
four
years
afterwards
new
plans
of
liberation
began
to
be
again
set
on
foot
but
on
this
occasion
the
influence
of
jeremiah
proved
strong
enough
to
avert
the
danger
but
when
a
definite
prospect
of
help
from
pharaoh
hophra
apries
presented
itself
in
the
craving
for
independence
proved
quite
irrepressible
revolt
was
declared
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
chaldaean
army
with
nebuchadnezzar
at
its
head
lay
before
jerusalem
for
a
while
everything
seemed
to
move
prosperously
the
egyptians
came
to
the
rescue
and
the
chaleaeans
were
compelled
to
raise
the
siege
in
order
to
cope
with
them
at
this
there
was
great
joy
in
jerusalem
but
jeremiah
continued
to
express
his
gloomy
views
the
event
proved
that
he
was
right
the
egyptians
were
repulsed
and
the
siege
resumed
the
city
was
bent
on
obstinate
resistance
in
vain
did
jeremiah
at
continual
risk
of
his
life
endeavour
to
bring
it
to
reason
the
king
who
agreed
with
the
prophet
did
not
venture
to
assert
his
opinion
against
the
dominant
terrorism
the
town
in
these
circumstances
was
at
last
taken
by
storm
and
along
with
the
temple
reduced
to
ruins
cruel
vengeance
was
taken
on
the
king
and
grandees
and
the
pacification
of
the
country
was
ensured
by
another
and
larger
deportation
of
the
inhabitants
to
babylon
thus
terminated
in
the
kingdom
of
judah
the
prophets
had
been
the
spiritual
destroyers
of
the
old
israel
in
old
times
the
nation
had
been
the
ideal
of
religion
in
actual
realisation
the
prophets
confronted
the
nation
with
an
ideal
to
which
it
did
not
correspond
then
to
bridge
over
this
interval
the
abstract
ideal
was
framed
into
a
law
and
to
this
law
the
nation
was
to
be
conformed
the
attempt
had
very
important
consequences
inasmuch
as
jehovah
continued
to
be
a
living
power
in
the
law
when
he
was
no
longer
realised
as
present
in
the
nation
but
that
was
not
what
the
prophets
had
meant
to
effect
what
they
were
unconsciously
labouring
towards
was
that
religious
individualism
which
had
its
historical
source
in
the
national
downfall
and
manifested
itself
not
exclusively
within
the
prophetical
sphere
with
such
men
as
amos
and
hosea
the
moral
personality
based
upon
an
inner
conviction
burst
through
the
limits
of
mere
nationality
their
mistake
was
in
supposing
that
they
could
make
their
way
of
thinking
the
basis
of
a
national
life
jeremiah
saw
through
the
mistake
the
true
israel
was
narrowed
to
himself
of
the
truth
of
his
conviction
he
never
had
a
moment
doubt
he
knew
that
jehovah
was
on
his
side
that
on
him
depended
the
eternal
future
but
instead
of
the
nation
the
heart
and
the
individual
conviction
were
to
him
the
subject
of
religion
on
the
ruins
of
jerusalem
he
gazed
into
the
future
filled
with
joyful
hope
sure
of
this
that
jehovah
would
one
day
pardon
past
sin
and
renew
the
relation
which
had
been
broken
on
the
basis
of
another
covenant
than
that
laid
down
in
deuteronomy
i
will
put
my
law
upon
their
heart
and
write
it
on
their
mind
none
shall
say
to
his
neighbour
know
the
lord
for
all
shall
have
that
knowledge
within
them
the
captivity
and
the
restoration
the
exiled
jews
were
not
scattered
all
over
chaldaea
but
were
allowed
to
remain
together
in
families
and
clans
many
of
them
notwithstanding
this
circumstance
must
have
lapsed
and
become
merged
in
the
surrounding
heathenism
but
many
also
continued
faithful
to
jehovah
and
to
israel
they
laboured
under
much
depression
and
sadness
groaning
under
the
wrath
of
jehovah
who
had
rejected
his
people
and
cancelled
his
covenant
they
were
lying
under
a
sort
of
vast
interdict
they
could
not
celebrate
any
sacrifice
or
keep
any
feast
they
could
only
observe
days
of
fasting
and
humiliation
and
such
rites
as
had
no
inseparable
connection
with
the
holy
land
the
observance
of
the
sabbath
and
the
practice
of
the
rite
of
circumcision
acquired
much
greater
importance
than
they
formerly
possessed
as
signs
of
a
common
religion
the
meetings
on
the
sabbath
day
out
of
which
the
synagogues
were
afterwards
developed
appear
to
have
first
come
into
use
during
this
period
perhaps
also
even
then
it
had
become
customary
to
read
aloud
from
the
prophetic
writings
which
set
forth
that
all
had
happened
in
the
providence
of
god
and
moreover
that
the
days
of
adversity
were
not
to
last
for
ever
matters
improved
somewhat
as
cyrus
entered
upon
his
victorious
career
was
he
the
man
in
whom
the
messianic
prophecies
had
found
their
fulfilment
the
majority
were
unwilling
to
think
so
for
it
was
out
of
israel
they
argued
that
the
messiah
was
to
proceed
who
should
establish
the
kingdom
of
god
upon
the
ruins
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
the
restitution
effected
by
means
of
a
persian
could
only
be
regarded
as
a
passing
incident
in
the
course
of
an
historical
process
that
had
its
goal
entirely
elsewhere
this
doubt
was
met
by
more
than
one
prophetical
writer
and
especially
by
the
great
anonymous
author
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
isaiah
away
with
sorrow
deliverance
is
at
the
door
is
it
a
humiliating
thing
that
israel
should
owe
its
freedom
to
a
persian
nay
is
it
not
rather
a
proof
of
the
sway
of
the
god
of
jacob
that
he
should
thus
summon
his
instruments
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
who
else
than
jehovah
could
have
thus
sent
cyrus
surely
not
the
false
gods
which
he
has
destroyed
jehovah
alone
it
was
who
foretold
and
foreknew
the
things
which
are
now
coming
to
pass
because
long
ago
he
had
prearranged
and
predetermined
them
and
they
are
now
being
executed
in
accordance
with
his
plan
rejoice
therefore
in
the
prospect
of
your
near
deliverance
prepare
yourselves
for
the
new
era
gird
yourselves
for
the
return
to
your
homes
it
is
to
be
observed
as
characteristic
in
this
prophecy
how
the
idea
of
jehovah
as
god
alone
and
god
over
all
in
constantly
recurring
lyrical
parenthesis
he
is
praised
as
the
author
of
the
world
and
of
all
nature
is
yet
placed
in
positive
relation
to
israel
alone
and
that
upon
the
principle
that
israel
is
in
exclusive
possession
of
the
universal
truth
which
can
not
perish
with
israel
but
must
through
the
instrumentality
of
israel
become
the
common
possession
of
the
whole
world
there
is
no
god
but
jehovah
and
israel
is
his
prophet
for
many
years
the
persian
monarch
put
the
patience
of
the
jews
to
the
proof
jehovah
judgment
upon
the
chaldaeans
instead
of
advancing
seemed
to
recede
at
length
however
their
hopes
were
realised
in
the
year
cyrus
brought
the
empire
of
babylon
to
an
end
and
gave
the
exiles
leave
to
seek
their
fatherland
once
more
this
permission
was
not
made
use
of
by
all
or
even
by
a
majority
the
number
of
those
who
returned
is
stated
at
whether
women
and
children
are
included
in
this
figure
is
uncertain
on
arriving
at
their
destination
after
the
difficult
march
through
the
desert
they
did
not
spread
themselves
over
the
whole
of
judah
but
settled
chiefly
in
the
neighbourhood
of
jerusalem
the
calebites
for
example
who
previously
had
had
their
settlements
in
and
around
hebron
now
settled
in
bethlehem
and
in
the
district
of
ephrath
they
found
it
necessary
to
concentrate
themselves
in
face
of
a
threatened
admixture
of
doubtful
elements
from
all
sides
people
belonging
to
the
surrounding
nations
had
pressed
into
the
depopulated
territory
of
judah
not
only
had
they
annexed
the
border
territories
where
for
example
the
edomites
or
idumaeans
held
the
whole
of
the
negeb
as
far
as
to
hebron
they
had
effected
lodgments
everywhere
and
as
the
ammonites
ashdodites
and
especially
the
samaritans
had
amalgamated
with
the
older
jewish
population
a
residue
of
which
had
remained
in
the
country
in
spite
of
all
that
had
happened
these
pagani
amme
haarec
gave
a
friendly
reception
to
the
returning
exiles
bne
haggola
particularly
did
the
samaritans
show
themselves
anxious
to
make
common
cause
with
them
but
they
were
met
with
no
reciprocal
cordiality
the
lesson
of
religious
isolation
which
the
children
of
the
captivity
had
learned
in
babylon
they
did
not
forget
on
their
return
to
their
home
here
also
they
lived
as
in
a
strange
land
not
the
native
of
judaea
but
the
man
who
could
trace
his
descent
from
the
exiles
in
babylon
was
reckoned
as
belonging
to
their
community
the
first
decennia
after
the
return
of
the
exiles
during
which
they
were
occupied
in
adjusting
themselves
to
their
new
homes
were
passed
under
a
variety
of
adverse
circumstances
and
by
no
means
either
in
joyousness
or
security
were
these
then
the
messianic
times
which
it
had
been
foretold
were
to
dawn
at
the
close
of
their
captivity
they
did
not
at
all
events
answer
the
expectations
which
had
been
formed
a
settlement
had
been
again
obtained
it
was
true
in
the
fatherland
but
the
persian
yoke
pressed
now
more
heavily
than
ever
the
babylonian
had
done
the
sins
of
god
people
seemed
still
unforgiven
their
period
of
not
yet
at
an
end
a
slight
improvement
as
is
shown
by
the
prophecies
of
haggai
and
zechariah
followed
when
in
the
year
the
obstacles
disappeared
which
until
then
had
stood
in
the
way
of
the
rebuilding
of
the
temple
the
work
then
begun
was
completed
in
inasmuch
as
the
jews
were
now
nothing
more
than
a
religious
community
based
upon
the
traditions
of
a
national
existence
that
had
ceased
the
rebuilding
of
the
temple
naturally
was
for
them
an
event
of
supreme
importance
the
law
of
the
new
theocracy
was
the
book
of
deuteronomy
this
was
the
foundation
on
which
the
structure
was
to
be
built
but
the
force
of
circumstances
and
the
spirit
of
the
age
had
even
before
and
during
the
exile
exerted
a
modifying
influence
upon
that
legislative
code
and
it
continued
to
do
so
still
at
first
a
son
of
david
had
continued
to
stand
at
the
head
of
the
bne
haggola
but
this
last
relic
of
the
old
monarchy
soon
had
to
give
way
to
a
persian
governor
who
was
under
the
control
of
the
satrap
of
syria
and
whose
principal
business
was
the
collection
of
revenue
thenceforward
the
sole
national
chief
was
joshua
the
high
priest
on
whom
accordingly
the
political
representation
also
of
the
community
naturally
devolved
in
the
circumstances
as
they
then
were
no
other
arrangement
was
possible
the
way
had
been
paved
for
it
long
before
in
so
far
as
the
assyrians
had
destroyed
the
kingdom
of
israel
while
in
the
kingdom
of
judah
which
survived
it
the
religious
cultus
had
greater
importance
attached
to
it
than
political
affairs
and
also
inasmuch
as
in
point
of
fact
the
practical
issue
of
the
prophetic
reformation
sketched
in
deuteronomy
had
been
to
make
the
temple
the
national
centre
still
more
than
formerly
the
hierocracy
towards
which
ezekiel
had
already
opened
the
way
was
simply
inevitable
it
took
the
form
of
a
monarchy
of
the
high
priest
he
having
stepped
into
the
place
formerly
occupied
by
the
theocratic
king
as
his
peers
and
at
his
side
stood
the
members
of
his
clan
the
levites
of
the
old
jerusalem
who
traced
their
descent
from
zadok
sadduk
the
common
levites
held
a
much
lower
rank
so
far
as
they
had
maintained
their
priestly
rank
at
all
and
had
not
been
degraded
in
accordance
with
ezekiel
law
chapter
xliv
to
the
position
of
mere
temple
servitors
levite
once
the
title
of
honour
bestowed
on
all
priests
became
more
and
more
confined
to
members
of
the
second
order
of
the
clergy
meanwhile
no
improvement
was
taking
place
in
the
condition
of
the
jewish
colonists
they
were
poor
they
had
incurred
the
hostility
of
their
neighbours
by
their
exclusiveness
the
persian
government
was
suspicious
the
incipient
decline
of
the
great
kingdom
was
accompanied
with
specially
unpleasant
consequences
so
far
as
palestine
was
concerned
megabyzus
all
this
naturally
tended
to
produce
in
the
community
a
certain
laxity
and
depression
to
what
purpose
it
was
asked
all
this
religious
strictness
which
led
to
so
much
that
was
unpleasant
why
all
this
zeal
for
jehovah
who
refused
to
be
mollified
by
it
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
the
upper
ranks
of
the
priesthood
were
least
of
all
concerned
to
counteract
this
tendency
their
priesthood
was
less
to
them
than
the
predominance
which
was
based
upon
it
they
looked
upon
the
neighbouring
ethnarchs
as
their
equals
and
maintained
relations
of
friendship
with
them
the
general
community
was
only
following
their
example
when
it
also
began
to
mingle
with
the
amme
haarec
the
danger
of
judaism
merging
into
heathenism
was
imminent
but
it
was
averted
by
a
new
accession
from
without
in
the
year
ezra
the
scribe
with
a
great
number
of
his
compatriots
set
out
from
babylon
for
the
purpose
of
reinforcing
the
jewish
element
in
palestine
the
jews
of
babylon
were
more
happily
situated
than
their
palestinian
brethren
and
it
was
comparatively
easy
for
them
to
take
up
a
separatist
attitude
because
they
were
surrounded
by
heathenism
not
partial
but
entire
they
were
no
great
losers
from
the
circumstance
that
they
were
precluded
from
participating
directly
in
the
life
of
the
ecclesiastical
community
the
torah
had
long
ago
become
separated
from
the
people
and
was
now
an
independent
abstraction
following
a
career
of
its
own
babylonia
was
the
place
where
a
further
codification
of
the
law
had
been
placed
alongside
of
deuteronomy
ezekiel
had
led
the
way
in
reducing
to
theory
and
to
writing
the
sacred
praxis
of
his
time
in
this
he
was
followed
by
an
entire
school
in
their
exile
the
levites
turned
scribes
since
then
babylon
continued
to
be
the
home
of
the
torah
and
while
in
palestine
itself
the
practice
was
becoming
laxer
their
literary
study
had
gradually
intensified
the
strictness
and
distinctive
peculiarities
of
judaism
and
now
there
came
to
palestine
a
babylonian
scribe
having
the
law
of
his
god
in
his
hand
and
armed
with
authority
from
the
persian
king
to
proceed
upon
the
basis
of
this
law
with
a
reformation
of
the
community
ezra
did
not
set
about
introducing
the
new
law
immediately
on
his
arrival
in
judaea
in
the
first
instance
he
concentrated
his
attention
on
the
task
of
effecting
a
strict
separation
between
the
bne
haggola
and
the
heathen
or
inhabitants
so
much
he
could
accomplish
upon
the
basis
of
deuteronomy
but
it
was
long
before
he
gave
publicity
to
the
law
which
he
himself
had
brought
why
he
hesitated
so
long
it
is
impossible
to
say
between
the
seventh
and
the
twentieth
year
of
artaxerxes
longimanus
there
is
a
great
hiatus
in
the
narrative
of
the
books
of
ezra
and
nehemiah
the
main
reason
appears
to
have
been
that
in
spite
of
the
good
will
of
the
persian
king
ezra
had
not
the
vigorous
support
of
the
local
authorities
but
this
was
indispensably
necessary
in
order
to
secure
recognition
for
a
new
law
at
last
in
it
fell
to
the
lot
of
a
jew
who
also
shared
the
views
of
ezra
nehemiah
ben
hakkelejah
according
to
the
present
punctuation
this
name
is
hakalja
hachaljah
but
such
a
pronunciation
is
inadmissible
it
has
no
possible
etymology
the
language
having
no
such
word
as
the
name
in
its
correct
form
means
wait
upon
jehovah
the
cupbearer
and
the
favourite
of
artaxerxes
to
be
sent
as
persian
governor
to
judaea
after
he
had
freed
the
community
from
external
pressure
with
vigour
and
success
and
brought
it
into
more
tolerable
outward
circumstances
the
business
of
introducing
the
new
was
next
proceeded
with
in
this
ezra
and
nehemiah
plainly
acted
in
concert
on
the
first
of
tisri
the
year
is
unfortunately
not
given
but
it
can
not
have
been
earlier
than
the
promulgation
of
the
law
began
at
a
great
gathering
in
jerusalem
ezra
supported
by
the
levites
was
present
towards
the
end
of
the
month
the
concluding
act
took
place
in
which
the
community
became
solemnly
bound
by
the
contents
of
the
law
special
prominence
was
given
to
those
provisions
with
which
the
people
were
directly
concerned
particularly
those
which
related
to
the
dues
payable
by
the
laity
to
the
priests
the
covenant
which
hitherto
had
rested
on
deuteronomy
was
thus
expanded
into
a
covenant
based
upon
the
entire
pentateuch
substantially
at
least
ezra
in
the
form
in
which
it
became
the
magna
charta
of
judaism
in
or
about
the
year
must
be
regarded
as
practically
identical
with
our
pentateuch
although
many
minor
amendments
and
very
considerable
additions
may
have
been
made
at
a
later
date
the
character
of
the
legislation
priestly
code
is
chiefly
marked
in
its
external
aspects
by
the
immense
extension
of
the
dues
payable
to
the
priests
and
by
the
sharp
distinction
made
between
the
descendants
of
aaron
and
the
common
levites
this
last
feature
is
to
be
traced
historically
to
the
circumstance
that
after
the
deuteronomic
reformation
the
legal
equality
between
the
levites
who
until
then
had
ministered
at
the
high
places
and
the
priests
of
the
temple
at
jerusalem
was
not
recognised
internally
it
is
mainly
characterised
by
its
ideal
of
levitical
holiness
the
way
in
which
it
everywhere
surrounds
life
with
purificatory
and
propitiatory
ceremonies
and
its
prevailing
reference
of
sacrifice
to
sin
noteworthy
also
is
the
manner
in
which
everything
is
regarded
from
the
point
of
view
of
jerusalem
a
feature
which
comes
much
more
boldly
into
prominence
here
than
in
deuteronomy
the
nation
and
the
temple
are
strictly
speaking
identified
that
externalisation
towards
which
the
prophetical
movement
in
order
to
become
practical
had
already
been
tending
in
deuteronomy
finally
achieved
its
acme
in
the
legislation
of
ezra
a
new
artificial
israel
was
the
result
but
after
all
the
old
would
have
pleased
an
amos
better
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
kernel
needed
a
shell
it
was
a
necessity
that
judaism
should
incrust
itself
in
this
manner
without
those
hard
and
ossified
forms
the
preservation
of
its
essential
elements
would
have
proved
impossible
at
a
time
when
all
nationalities
and
at
the
same
time
all
bonds
of
religion
and
national
customs
were
beginning
to
be
broken
up
in
the
seeming
cosmos
and
real
chaos
of
the
empire
the
jews
stood
out
like
a
rock
in
the
midst
of
the
ocean
when
the
natural
conditions
of
independent
nationality
all
failed
them
they
nevertheless
artificially
maintained
it
with
an
energy
truly
marvellous
and
thereby
preserved
for
themselves
and
at
the
same
time
for
the
whole
world
an
eternal
good
as
regards
the
subsequent
history
of
the
jewish
community
under
the
persian
domination
we
have
almost
no
information
the
high
priest
in
nehemiah
time
was
eliashib
son
of
joiakim
and
grandson
of
joshua
the
patriarchal
head
of
the
sons
of
zadok
who
had
returned
from
babylon
he
was
succeeded
in
the
direct
line
by
joiada
johanan
and
jaddua
nehemiah
xii
the
was
in
office
at
the
time
of
alexander
the
great
josephus
antiquities
xi
palestine
was
the
province
which
suffered
most
severely
of
all
from
the
storms
which
marked
the
last
days
of
the
sinking
persian
empire
and
it
is
hardly
likely
that
the
jews
escaped
their
force
we
know
definitely
however
of
only
one
episode
in
which
the
persian
general
bagoses
interfered
in
a
disagreeable
controversy
about
the
cir
to
this
period
also
and
not
as
josephus
states
to
the
time
of
alexander
belongs
the
constitution
of
the
samaritan
community
on
an
independent
footing
by
manasseh
a
jewish
priest
of
rank
he
was
expelled
from
jerusalem
by
nehemiah
in
for
refusing
to
separate
from
his
alien
wife
he
took
shelter
with
his
sanballat
the
samaritan
prince
who
built
him
a
temple
on
mount
gerizim
near
shechem
where
he
organised
a
samaritan
church
and
a
samaritan
worship
on
the
jerusalem
model
and
on
the
basis
of
a
but
slightly
modified
jerusalem
pentateuch
if
the
samaritans
had
hitherto
exerted
themselves
to
the
utmost
to
obtain
admission
into
the
fellowship
of
the
jews
they
henceforward
were
as
averse
to
have
anything
to
do
with
these
as
these
were
to
have
any
dealings
with
them
the
temple
on
mount
gerizim
was
now
the
symbol
of
their
independence
as
a
distinct
religious
sect
for
the
jews
this
was
a
great
advantage
as
they
had
no
longer
to
dread
the
danger
of
syncretism
they
could
now
quite
confidently
admit
the
amme
haarec
into
their
communion
in
the
assurance
of
assimilating
them
without
any
risk
of
the
opposite
process
taking
place
the
judaizing
process
began
first
with
the
country
districts
immediately
surrounding
jerusalem
and
then
extended
to
galilee
and
many
portions
of
peraea
in
connection
with
it
the
hebrew
language
which
hitherto
had
been
firmly
retained
by
the
bne
haggola
now
began
to
yield
to
the
aramaic
and
to
hold
its
own
only
as
a
sacred
speech
judaism
and
christianity
the
legislation
is
not
addressed
to
the
people
but
to
the
congregation
its
chief
concern
is
the
regulation
of
worship
political
matters
are
not
touched
upon
as
they
are
in
the
hands
of
a
foreigner
lord
the
hierocracy
is
taken
for
granted
as
the
constitution
of
the
congregation
the
head
of
the
cultus
is
the
head
of
the
whole
the
high
priest
takes
the
place
of
the
king
the
other
priests
though
his
brothers
or
his
sons
are
officially
subordinate
to
him
as
bishops
to
the
supreme
pontiff
they
again
are
distinguished
from
the
levites
not
only
by
their
office
but
also
by
their
noble
blood
though
the
levites
belong
by
descent
to
the
clergy
of
which
they
form
the
lowest
grade
the
material
basis
of
the
hierarchical
pyramid
is
furnished
by
the
contributions
of
the
laity
which
are
required
on
a
scale
which
can
not
be
called
modest
such
is
the
outward
aspect
of
the
rule
of
the
holy
in
israel
inwardly
the
ideal
of
holiness
governs
the
whole
of
life
by
means
of
a
net
of
ceremonies
and
observances
which
separate
the
jew
from
the
natural
man
holy
means
almost
the
same
as
exclusive
originally
the
term
was
equivalent
to
divine
but
now
it
is
used
chiefly
in
the
sense
of
religious
priestly
as
if
the
divine
were
to
be
known
from
the
worldly
the
natural
by
outward
marks
it
had
so
fallen
out
even
before
the
exile
that
the
reform
of
the
theocracy
which
the
prophets
demanded
began
in
the
cultus
and
after
the
exile
this
tendency
could
not
fail
to
be
persisted
in
the
restoration
of
judaism
took
place
in
the
form
of
a
restoration
of
the
cultus
yet
this
restoration
was
not
a
relapse
into
the
heathen
ways
which
the
prophets
had
attacked
the
old
meaning
of
the
festivals
and
of
the
sacrifices
had
long
faded
away
and
after
the
interruption
of
the
exile
they
would
scarcely
have
blossomed
again
of
themselves
they
had
become
simply
statutes
unexplained
commands
of
an
absolute
will
the
cultus
had
no
longer
any
real
value
for
the
deity
it
was
valuable
only
as
an
exercise
of
obedience
to
the
law
if
it
had
been
at
first
the
bond
connecting
israel
with
heathenism
now
on
the
contrary
it
was
the
shield
behind
which
judaism
retreated
to
be
safe
from
heathenism
there
was
no
other
means
to
make
judaism
secure
and
the
cultus
was
nothing
more
than
a
means
to
that
end
it
was
the
shell
around
the
faith
and
practice
of
the
fathers
around
the
religion
of
moral
monotheism
which
it
alone
preserved
until
it
could
become
the
common
property
of
the
world
the
great
public
worship
gave
the
new
theocracy
a
firm
centre
thus
keeping
it
one
and
undivided
and
helped
it
to
an
organisation
but
of
more
importance
was
the
minor
private
cultus
of
pious
exercises
which
served
to
judaize
the
whole
life
of
every
individual
for
the
centre
of
gravity
of
judaism
was
in
the
individual
judaism
was
gathered
from
scattered
elements
and
it
depended
on
the
labour
of
the
individual
to
make
himself
a
jew
this
is
the
secret
of
the
persistence
of
judaism
even
in
the
diaspora
the
initiatory
act
of
circumcision
which
conferred
an
indelible
character
was
not
the
only
safeguard
the
whole
of
the
education
which
followed
that
act
went
to
guard
against
the
disintegrating
effects
of
individualism
this
is
the
real
significance
of
the
incessant
discipline
which
consisted
mainly
in
the
observance
of
laws
of
purity
and
generally
of
regulations
devised
to
guard
against
sin
for
what
holiness
required
was
not
to
do
good
but
to
avoid
sin
by
the
sin
and
trespass
offerings
and
by
the
great
day
of
atonement
this
private
cultus
was
connected
with
that
of
the
temple
hence
it
was
that
all
these
institutions
fitted
so
admirably
into
the
system
the
whole
of
life
was
directed
in
a
definite
sacred
path
every
moment
there
was
a
divine
command
to
fulfil
and
this
kept
a
man
from
following
too
much
the
thoughts
and
desires
of
his
own
heart
the
jews
trained
themselves
with
an
earnestness
and
zeal
which
have
no
parallel
to
create
in
the
absence
of
all
natural
conditions
a
holy
nation
which
should
answer
to
the
law
the
concrete
embodiment
of
the
ideals
of
the
prophets
in
the
individualism
thus
moulded
into
uniformity
lay
the
chief
difference
which
separated
the
new
period
from
the
old
the
aim
was
universal
culture
by
the
law
that
the
prophecy
should
be
fulfilled
which
says
they
shall
all
be
taught
of
god
this
universal
culture
was
certainly
of
a
peculiar
kind
and
imposed
more
troublesome
observances
than
the
culture
of
our
day
yet
the
strange
duties
which
the
law
imposed
were
not
universally
felt
to
be
a
heavy
burden
precepts
which
were
plain
and
had
to
do
with
something
outward
were
very
capable
of
being
kept
the
harder
they
seemed
at
first
the
easier
were
they
when
the
habit
had
been
formed
a
man
saw
that
he
was
doing
what
was
prescribed
and
did
not
ask
what
was
the
use
of
it
the
body
of
regulations
even
came
to
be
felt
as
a
sort
of
emancipation
from
self
never
had
the
individual
felt
himself
so
responsible
for
all
he
did
and
left
undone
but
the
responsibility
was
oppressive
and
it
was
well
that
there
should
be
a
definite
precept
for
every
hour
of
his
life
thus
diminishing
the
risk
of
his
going
astray
nor
must
we
forget
that
the
torah
contained
other
precepts
than
those
which
were
merely
ceremonial
the
kernel
did
not
quite
harden
into
wood
inside
the
shell
we
must
even
acknowledge
that
moral
sentiment
gained
very
perceptibly
in
this
period
both
in
delicacy
and
in
power
this
also
is
connected
with
the
fact
that
religion
was
not
as
before
the
custom
of
the
people
but
the
work
of
the
individual
a
further
consequence
of
this
was
that
men
began
to
reflect
upon
religion
the
age
in
question
saw
the
rise
of
the
wisdom
of
which
we
possess
examples
in
the
book
of
job
in
the
proverbs
of
solomon
and
of
the
son
of
sirach
and
in
ecclesiastes
this
wisdom
flourished
not
only
in
judah
but
also
at
the
same
time
in
edom
it
had
the
universalistic
tendency
which
is
natural
to
reflection
the
proverbs
of
solomon
would
scarcely
claim
attention
had
they
arisen
on
greek
or
arabian
soil
they
are
remarkable
in
their
pale
generality
only
because
they
are
of
jewish
origin
in
the
book
of
job
a
problem
of
faith
is
treated
by
syrians
and
arabians
just
as
if
they
were
jews
in
ecclesiastes
religion
abandons
the
theocratic
ground
altogether
and
becomes
a
kind
of
philosophy
in
which
there
is
room
even
for
doubt
and
unbelief
speculation
did
not
on
the
whole
take
away
from
depth
of
feeling
on
the
contrary
individualism
helped
to
make
religion
more
intense
this
is
seen
strikingly
in
the
psalms
which
are
altogether
the
fruit
of
this
period
even
the
sacrificial
practice
of
the
priests
was
made
subjective
being
incorporated
in
the
torah
made
a
matter
for
every
one
to
learn
though
the
laity
could
not
take
part
in
the
ceremony
they
were
at
least
to
be
thoroughly
informed
in
all
the
minutiae
of
the
system
the
law
was
a
means
of
interesting
every
one
in
the
great
public
sacrificial
procedure
another
circumstance
also
tended
to
remove
the
centre
of
gravity
of
the
temple
service
from
the
priests
to
the
congregation
the
service
of
song
though
executed
by
choirs
of
singers
was
yet
in
idea
the
song
of
the
congregation
and
came
to
be
of
more
importance
than
the
acts
of
worship
which
it
accompanied
and
inspired
the
holy
one
of
israel
sat
enthroned
not
on
the
of
the
altar
but
in
the
praises
of
the
congregation
pouring
out
its
heart
in
prayer
the
sacrifices
were
merely
the
external
occasion
for
visiting
the
temple
the
real
reason
for
doing
so
lay
in
the
need
for
the
strength
and
refreshment
to
be
found
in
religious
fellowship
by
the
torah
religion
came
to
be
a
thing
to
be
learned
hence
the
need
of
teachers
in
the
church
of
the
second
temple
as
the
scribes
had
codified
the
torah
it
was
also
their
task
to
imprint
it
on
the
minds
of
the
people
and
to
fill
their
life
with
it
in
this
way
they
at
the
same
time
founded
a
supplementary
and
changing
tradition
which
kept
pace
with
the
needs
of
the
time
the
place
of
teaching
was
the
synagogue
there
the
law
and
the
prophets
were
read
and
explained
on
the
sabbath
the
synagogue
and
the
sabbath
were
of
more
importance
than
the
temple
and
the
festivals
and
the
moral
influence
of
the
scribes
transcended
that
of
the
priests
who
had
to
be
content
with
outward
power
and
dignity
the
rule
of
religion
was
essentially
the
rule
of
the
law
and
consequently
the
rabbis
at
last
served
themselves
heirs
to
the
hierarchs
at
the
same
time
while
the
government
of
the
law
was
acknowledged
in
principle
it
could
at
no
time
be
said
to
be
even
approximately
realised
in
fact
the
priests
who
stood
at
the
head
of
the
theocracy
cared
chiefly
as
was
quite
natural
for
the
maintenance
of
their
own
supremacy
and
there
were
sheep
in
the
flock
not
to
be
kept
from
breaking
out
both
in
the
upper
and
in
the
lower
classes
of
society
the
school
could
not
suppress
nature
altogether
it
was
no
trifle
even
to
know
the
six
hundred
and
thirteen
commandments
of
the
written
law
and
the
incalculable
number
of
the
unwritten
religion
had
to
be
made
a
profession
of
if
it
was
to
be
practiced
aright
it
became
an
art
and
thereby
at
the
same
time
a
matter
of
party
the
leaders
of
the
religious
were
of
course
the
scribes
the
division
became
very
apparent
in
the
time
of
the
hellenization
which
preceded
the
maccabaean
revolt
at
that
period
the
name
of
pharisees
the
separated
came
into
vogue
for
the
party
of
the
religious
but
the
separation
and
antipathy
between
the
godly
and
the
ungodly
had
existed
before
this
and
had
marked
the
life
of
the
congregation
after
the
exile
from
the
very
first
it
was
the
law
that
gave
the
jewish
religion
its
peculiar
character
but
on
the
other
hand
a
hope
was
not
wanting
to
that
religion
the
jews
cherished
the
prospect
of
a
reward
for
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
this
hope
attached
itself
to
the
old
prophecies
certainly
in
a
very
fantastic
way
the
jews
had
no
historical
life
and
therefore
painted
the
old
time
according
to
their
ideas
and
framed
the
time
to
come
according
to
their
wishes
they
stood
in
no
living
relation
with
either
the
past
or
the
future
the
present
was
not
with
them
a
bridge
from
the
one
to
the
other
they
did
not
think
of
bestirring
themselves
with
a
view
to
the
kingdom
of
god
they
had
no
national
and
historical
existence
and
made
no
preparations
to
procure
such
a
thing
for
themselves
they
only
hoped
for
it
as
a
reward
of
faithful
keeping
of
the
law
yet
they
dreamed
not
only
of
a
restoration
of
the
old
kingdom
but
of
the
erection
of
a
universal
which
should
raise
its
head
at
jerusalem
over
the
ruins
of
the
heathen
empires
they
regarded
the
history
of
the
world
as
a
great
suit
between
themselves
and
the
heathen
in
this
suit
they
were
in
the
right
and
they
waited
for
right
to
be
done
them
if
the
decision
was
delayed
their
sins
were
the
reason
satan
was
accusing
them
before
the
throne
of
god
and
causing
the
judgment
to
be
postponed
they
were
subjected
to
hard
trials
and
if
tribulation
revived
their
hopes
with
much
greater
certainty
did
it
bring
their
sins
into
sorrowful
remembrance
outward
circumstances
still
influenced
in
the
strongest
way
their
religious
mood
but
the
old
belief
in
retribution
which
sought
to
justify
itself
in
connection
with
the
fortunes
of
the
congregation
proved
here
also
unequal
to
the
strain
laid
upon
it
even
in
deuteronomy
it
is
maintained
that
the
race
is
not
to
suffer
for
the
act
of
an
individual
jeremiah
contemporaries
thought
it
monstrous
that
because
the
fathers
had
eaten
sour
grapes
the
teeth
of
the
children
should
be
set
on
edge
ezekiel
championed
in
a
notable
way
the
cause
of
individualism
on
this
ground
he
denounced
the
jews
who
had
remained
in
palestine
and
who
regarded
themselves
as
the
successors
of
the
people
of
jehovah
because
they
dwelt
in
the
holy
land
and
had
maintained
some
sort
of
existence
as
a
people
in
his
view
only
those
souls
which
were
saved
from
the
dispersion
of
the
exile
were
to
count
as
heirs
of
the
promise
the
theocracy
was
not
to
be
perpetuated
by
the
nation
but
by
the
individual
righteous
men
he
maintained
that
each
man
lived
because
of
his
own
righteousness
and
died
because
of
his
own
wickedness
nay
more
the
fate
of
the
individual
corresponded
even
in
its
fluctuations
to
his
moral
worth
at
successive
times
the
aim
he
pursued
in
this
was
a
good
one
in
view
of
a
despair
which
thought
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
pine
and
rot
away
because
of
former
sins
he
was
anxious
to
maintain
the
freedom
of
the
will
the
possibility
of
repentance
and
forgiveness
but
the
way
he
chose
for
this
end
was
not
a
good
one
on
his
showing
it
was
chance
which
ultimately
decided
who
was
good
and
who
was
wicked
the
old
view
of
retribution
which
allowed
time
for
judgment
to
operate
far
beyond
the
limit
of
the
individual
life
had
truth
in
it
but
this
view
had
none
yet
it
possessed
one
merit
that
it
brought
up
a
problem
which
had
to
be
faced
and
which
was
a
subject
of
reflection
for
a
long
time
afterwards
the
problem
assumed
the
form
of
a
controversy
as
to
the
principle
on
which
piety
was
rewarded
this
controversy
taking
the
place
of
the
great
contest
between
israel
and
the
heathen
were
the
wicked
right
in
saying
that
there
was
no
god
that
he
did
not
rule
and
judge
on
earth
did
he
in
truth
dwell
behind
the
clouds
and
did
he
not
care
about
the
doings
of
men
in
that
case
piety
would
be
an
illusion
piety
can
not
maintain
itself
if
god
makes
no
difference
between
the
godly
and
the
wicked
and
has
nothing
more
to
say
to
the
one
than
to
the
other
for
piety
is
not
content
to
stretch
out
its
hands
to
the
empty
air
it
must
meet
an
arm
descending
from
heaven
it
must
have
a
reward
not
for
the
sake
of
the
reward
but
in
order
to
be
sure
of
its
own
reality
in
order
to
know
that
there
is
a
communion
of
god
with
men
and
a
road
which
leads
to
it
the
usual
form
of
this
reward
is
the
forgiveness
of
sins
that
is
the
true
motive
of
the
fear
of
god
that
is
to
say
as
long
as
it
is
well
with
him
the
godly
man
does
not
doubt
and
so
does
not
require
any
unmistakable
evidence
by
which
he
may
be
justified
and
assured
of
the
favour
of
god
but
misfortune
and
pain
destroy
this
certainty
they
are
accusers
of
sin
god
warnings
and
corrections
now
is
the
time
to
hold
fast
the
faith
that
god
leads
the
godly
to
repentance
and
destroys
the
wicked
that
he
forgives
the
sin
of
the
former
but
punishes
and
avenges
that
of
the
latter
but
this
faith
involves
a
hope
of
living
to
see
better
things
the
justification
of
which
the
good
man
is
sure
must
at
last
be
attested
by
an
objective
judgment
of
god
before
the
whole
world
and
the
godly
delivered
from
his
sufferings
hence
the
constant
anxiety
and
restlessness
of
his
conscience
the
judgment
passed
upon
him
is
ultimately
to
be
gathered
from
the
external
world
and
he
can
never
be
sure
how
it
is
to
turn
out
and
a
principle
is
also
at
stake
the
whole
time
namely
the
question
whether
godliness
or
ungodliness
is
right
in
its
fundamental
conviction
each
individual
case
at
once
affects
the
generality
the
sufferings
of
one
godly
person
touch
all
the
godly
when
he
recovers
and
is
saved
they
triumph
when
he
succumbs
or
seems
to
succumb
to
death
they
are
cast
down
unless
in
this
case
they
should
change
their
minds
about
him
and
hold
him
to
be
a
hypocrite
whom
god
has
judged
and
unmasked
in
the
same
way
they
are
all
hurt
at
the
prosperity
of
an
ungodly
man
and
rejoice
together
at
his
fall
not
from
jealousy
or
pleasure
in
misfortune
for
its
own
sake
but
because
in
the
one
case
their
faith
is
overturned
while
in
the
other
it
is
confirmed
the
tortures
incident
to
this
curious
oscillation
between
believing
and
seeing
are
set
forth
in
the
most
trenchant
way
in
the
book
of
job
job
placed
in
an
agonizing
situation
condemned
without
hope
to
the
death
of
sinners
and
yet
conscious
of
his
godliness
demands
vengeance
for
his
blood
unjustly
shed
but
the
vengeance
is
to
be
executed
on
god
and
in
such
a
case
who
can
be
the
avenger
there
is
no
one
but
god
himself
and
thus
the
striking
thought
arises
that
god
will
be
the
champion
against
god
of
his
innocence
after
having
first
murdered
it
from
the
god
of
the
present
he
appeals
to
the
god
of
the
future
but
the
identity
between
these
two
is
yet
maintained
and
even
now
the
god
who
slays
him
is
the
sole
witness
of
his
innocence
in
which
the
world
and
his
friends
have
ceased
to
believe
god
must
be
this
now
if
he
is
to
avenge
him
in
the
future
an
inner
antinomy
is
in
this
way
impersonated
the
view
of
the
friends
is
one
of
which
the
sufferer
himself
can
not
divest
himself
hence
the
conflict
in
his
soul
but
supported
by
the
unconquerable
power
of
his
good
conscience
he
struggles
till
he
frees
himself
from
the
delusion
he
believes
more
firmly
in
the
direct
testimony
of
his
conscience
than
in
the
evidence
of
facts
and
the
world
judgment
about
him
and
against
the
dreadful
god
of
reality
the
righteous
god
of
faith
victoriously
asserts
himself
job
in
the
end
reaches
the
conclusion
that
he
can
not
understand
god
ways
this
is
a
negative
expression
of
the
position
that
he
holds
fast
in
spite
of
all
to
himself
and
to
god
that
is
to
say
that
not
outward
experience
but
inner
feeling
is
to
decide
this
inner
feeling
of
the
union
of
god
with
the
godly
meets
us
also
in
some
of
the
psalms
where
in
spite
of
depression
arising
from
untoward
circumstances
it
maintains
itself
as
a
reality
which
can
not
be
shaken
which
temptations
and
doubts
even
tend
to
strengthen
it
was
a
momentous
step
when
the
soul
in
its
relations
to
god
ventured
to
take
its
stand
upon
itself
to
trust
itself
this
was
an
indirect
product
of
prophecy
but
one
of
not
less
importance
than
its
direct
product
the
law
the
prophets
declared
the
revelation
of
god
which
had
authority
for
all
but
along
with
this
they
had
their
own
personal
experience
and
the
subjective
truth
of
which
they
thus
became
aware
proved
a
more
powerful
solvent
and
emancipator
than
the
objective
one
which
formed
the
subject
of
their
revelation
they
preached
the
law
to
deaf
ears
and
laboured
in
vain
to
convert
the
people
but
if
their
labour
had
produced
no
outward
result
it
had
an
inner
result
for
them
rejected
by
the
people
they
clung
the
more
closely
to
jehovah
in
the
conviction
that
the
defeated
cause
was
favoured
by
him
that
he
was
with
them
and
not
with
the
people
especially
with
jeremiah
did
prophecy
which
is
designed
primarily
to
act
on
others
transform
itself
into
an
inner
converse
with
the
deity
which
lifted
him
above
all
the
annoyances
of
his
life
in
this
relation
however
there
was
nothing
distinctively
prophetical
just
because
it
was
a
matter
of
the
inner
life
alone
and
was
sufficient
for
itself
it
was
just
the
essence
of
the
life
of
religion
that
the
prophets
thus
brought
to
view
and
helped
to
declare
itself
the
experience
of
jeremiah
propagated
itself
and
became
the
experience
of
religious
israel
this
was
the
power
by
which
israel
was
enabled
to
rise
again
after
every
fall
the
good
conscience
towards
god
the
profound
sentiment
of
union
with
him
proved
able
to
defy
all
the
blows
of
outward
fortune
in
this
strength
the
servant
despised
and
slain
triumphed
over
the
world
the
broken
and
contrite
heart
was
clothed
and
set
on
high
with
the
life
and
power
of
the
almighty
god
this
divine
spirit
of
assurance
rises
to
its
boldest
expression
in
the
psalm
nevertheless
i
am
continually
with
thee
thou
holdest
me
by
my
right
hand
thou
guidest
me
with
thy
counsel
and
drawest
me
after
thee
by
the
hand
if
i
have
thee
i
desire
not
heaven
nor
earth
if
my
flesh
and
my
heart
fail
thou
god
art
for
ever
the
strength
of
my
heart
and
my
portion
the
life
surrendered
is
here
found
again
in
a
higher
life
without
any
expression
of
hope
of
a
hereafter
in
the
book
of
job
we
do
indeed
find
a
trace
of
this
hope
in
the
form
that
even
after
the
death
of
the
martyr
god
may
still
find
opportunity
to
justify
him
and
pronounce
him
innocent
yet
this
idea
is
only
touched
on
as
a
distant
possibility
and
is
at
once
dropped
certainly
the
position
of
that
man
is
a
grand
one
who
can
cast
into
the
scale
against
death
and
devil
his
inner
certainty
of
union
with
god
so
grand
indeed
that
we
must
in
honesty
be
ashamed
to
repeat
those
words
of
the
psalm
but
the
point
of
view
is
too
high
the
danger
was
imminent
of
falling
from
it
down
into
the
dust
and
seeking
comfort
and
support
in
the
first
earthly
experience
that
might
offer
or
on
the
other
hand
sinking
into
despair
subjective
feeling
was
not
enough
of
itself
to
outbid
the
contradictions
of
nature
the
feeling
must
take
an
objective
form
a
world
other
than
this
one
answering
the
demands
of
morality
must
build
itself
up
to
form
a
contrast
to
the
world
actually
existing
the
merit
of
laying
the
foundations
for
this
religious
metaphysic
which
the
time
called
for
belongs
if
not
to
the
pharisees
themselves
at
least
to
the
circles
from
which
they
immediately
proceeded
the
main
features
of
that
metaphysic
first
appear
in
the
book
of
daniel
where
we
find
a
doctrine
of
the
last
things
we
have
already
spoken
of
the
transition
from
the
old
prophecy
to
apocalypse
with
the
destruction
of
the
nation
and
the
cessation
of
historical
life
hope
was
released
from
all
obligation
to
conform
to
historical
conditions
it
no
longer
set
up
an
aim
to
which
even
the
present
might
aspire
but
ran
riot
after
an
ideal
at
the
advent
of
which
the
historical
development
would
be
suddenly
broken
off
to
be
pious
was
all
the
jews
could
do
at
the
time
but
it
caused
them
bitter
regret
that
they
had
no
part
in
the
government
of
the
world
and
in
thought
they
anticipated
the
fulfilment
of
their
wishes
these
they
raised
to
an
pitch
in
proportion
as
their
antagonism
to
the
heathen
became
more
pronounced
and
as
the
world
became
more
hostile
to
them
and
they
to
the
world
as
the
heathen
empires
stood
in
the
way
of
the
universal
dominion
of
israel
the
whole
of
them
together
were
regarded
as
one
power
and
this
was
then
set
over
against
the
kingdom
of
god
of
israel
the
kingdom
of
god
was
entirely
future
the
fulfilling
of
the
law
did
not
prepare
the
way
for
it
but
was
only
a
statutory
condition
for
its
coming
not
related
to
it
inwardly
as
cause
to
effect
history
was
suddenly
to
come
to
a
stop
and
cease
the
jews
counted
the
days
to
the
judgment
the
judgment
was
the
act
by
which
god
would
at
once
realise
all
their
wishes
the
view
thus
taken
of
the
world
history
was
a
very
comprehensive
one
and
well
worked
out
from
its
principle
yet
of
an
entirely
negative
character
the
further
the
world
history
went
wilfully
away
from
its
goal
the
nearer
did
it
unintentionally
approach
its
goal
in
this
view
moreover
the
earth
always
continued
to
be
the
place
of
hope
the
kingdom
of
god
was
brought
by
the
judgment
into
earthly
history
it
was
on
earth
that
the
ideal
was
to
be
realised
a
step
further
and
the
struggle
of
the
dualism
of
the
earth
was
preluded
in
the
skies
by
the
angels
as
the
representatives
of
the
different
powers
and
nations
in
this
struggle
a
place
was
assigned
to
satan
at
first
he
was
merely
the
accuser
whom
god
himself
had
appointed
and
in
this
character
he
drew
attention
to
the
sins
of
the
jews
before
god
and
thereby
delayed
the
judicial
sentence
in
their
favour
but
ultimately
though
this
took
place
late
and
is
not
met
with
in
the
book
of
daniel
he
came
to
be
the
independent
leader
of
the
power
opposed
to
god
god
cause
being
identified
with
that
of
the
jews
but
as
this
prelude
of
the
struggle
took
place
in
heaven
its
result
was
also
anticipated
the
kingdom
of
god
is
on
earth
a
thing
of
the
future
but
even
now
it
is
preserved
in
heaven
with
all
its
treasures
one
day
to
descend
from
there
to
the
earth
heaven
is
the
place
where
the
good
things
of
the
future
are
kept
which
are
not
and
yet
must
be
that
is
its
original
and
true
signification
but
the
most
important
question
came
at
last
to
be
how
individuals
were
to
have
part
in
the
glory
of
the
future
how
was
it
with
the
martyrs
who
had
died
in
the
expectation
of
the
kingdom
of
god
before
it
came
the
doctrine
of
the
was
formed
if
their
merit
was
not
of
service
to
themselves
it
was
yet
of
service
to
others
but
this
was
a
solution
with
which
individualism
could
not
rest
content
and
what
of
the
ungodly
were
they
to
escape
from
wrath
because
they
died
before
the
day
of
judgment
it
was
necessary
that
the
departed
also
should
be
allowed
to
take
some
part
in
the
coming
retribution
thus
there
arose
it
is
remarkable
how
late
and
how
slowly
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
that
the
kingdom
of
god
might
not
be
of
service
only
to
those
who
happened
to
be
alive
at
the
judgment
yet
at
first
this
doctrine
was
only
used
to
explain
particularly
striking
cases
the
book
of
daniel
says
nothing
of
a
general
resurrection
but
speaks
in
fact
only
of
a
resurrection
of
the
martyrs
and
a
punishment
of
the
wicked
after
death
with
all
this
the
resurrection
is
not
the
entrance
to
a
life
above
the
earth
but
to
a
second
earthly
life
to
a
world
in
which
it
is
no
longer
the
heathen
but
the
jews
who
bear
rule
and
take
the
lead
of
a
general
judgment
at
the
last
day
or
of
heaven
and
hell
in
the
christian
sense
the
jews
know
nothing
though
these
ideas
might
so
easily
have
suggested
themselves
to
them
it
is
not
easy
to
find
points
of
view
from
which
to
pronounce
on
the
character
of
judaism
it
is
a
system
but
a
practical
system
which
can
scarcely
be
set
forth
in
relation
to
one
leading
thought
as
it
is
an
irregular
product
of
history
it
lives
on
the
stores
of
the
past
but
is
not
simply
the
total
of
what
had
been
previously
acquired
it
is
full
of
new
impulses
and
has
an
entirely
different
physiognomy
from
that
of
hebrew
antiquity
so
much
so
that
it
is
hard
even
to
catch
a
likeness
judaism
is
everywhere
historically
comprehensible
and
yet
it
is
a
mass
of
antinomies
we
are
struck
with
the
free
flight
of
thought
and
the
deep
inwardness
of
feeling
which
are
found
in
some
passages
in
the
wisdom
and
in
the
psalms
but
on
the
other
hand
we
meet
with
a
pedantic
asceticism
which
is
far
from
lovely
and
with
pious
wishes
the
greediness
of
which
is
and
these
unedifying
features
are
the
dominant
ones
of
the
system
monotheism
is
worked
out
to
its
furthest
consequences
and
at
the
same
time
is
enlisted
in
the
service
of
the
narrowest
selfishness
israel
participates
in
the
sovereignty
of
the
one
god
the
creator
of
heaven
and
earth
becomes
the
manager
of
a
petty
scheme
of
salvation
the
living
god
descends
from
his
throne
to
make
way
for
the
law
the
law
thrusts
itself
in
everywhere
it
commands
and
blocks
up
the
access
to
heaven
it
regulates
and
sets
limits
to
the
understanding
of
the
divine
working
on
earth
as
far
as
it
can
it
takes
the
soul
out
of
religion
and
spoils
morality
it
demands
a
service
of
god
which
though
revealed
may
yet
with
truth
be
called
a
and
unnatural
one
the
sense
and
use
of
which
are
apparent
neither
to
the
understanding
nor
the
heart
the
labour
is
done
for
the
sake
of
the
exercise
it
does
no
one
any
good
and
rejoices
neither
god
nor
man
it
has
no
inner
aim
after
which
it
spontaneously
strives
and
which
it
hopes
to
attain
by
itself
but
only
an
outward
one
namely
the
reward
attached
to
it
which
might
as
well
be
attached
to
other
and
possibly
even
more
curious
conditions
the
ideal
is
a
negative
one
to
keep
one
self
from
sin
not
a
positive
one
to
do
good
upon
the
earth
the
morality
is
one
which
scarcely
requires
for
its
exercise
the
existence
of
now
pious
exercises
can
dam
up
life
and
hold
it
in
bounds
they
may
conquer
from
it
more
and
more
ground
and
at
last
turn
it
into
one
great
sabbath
but
they
can
not
penetrate
it
at
the
root
the
occupation
of
the
hands
and
the
desire
of
the
heart
fall
asunder
what
the
hands
are
doing
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
earth
and
bears
no
reference
to
earthly
objects
but
with
the
jews
the
result
of
this
is
that
their
hope
assumes
a
more
worldly
complexion
there
is
no
connection
between
the
good
one
and
goodness
there
are
exceptions
but
they
disappear
in
the
system
the
gospel
develops
hidden
impulses
of
the
old
testament
but
it
is
a
protest
against
the
ruling
tendency
of
judaism
jesus
understands
monotheism
in
a
different
way
from
his
contemporaries
they
think
in
connection
with
it
of
the
folly
of
the
heathen
and
their
great
happiness
in
calling
the
true
god
their
own
he
thinks
of
the
claims
not
to
be
disputed
or
avoided
which
the
creator
makes
on
the
creature
he
feels
the
reality
of
god
dominating
the
whole
of
life
he
breathes
in
the
fear
of
the
judge
who
requires
an
account
for
every
idle
word
and
has
power
to
destroy
body
and
soul
in
hell
no
man
can
serve
two
masters
ye
can
not
serve
god
and
mammon
where
your
treasure
is
there
will
your
heart
be
also
this
monotheism
is
not
to
be
satisfied
with
stipulated
services
how
many
and
great
soever
it
demands
the
whole
man
it
renders
doubleness
of
heart
and
hypocrisy
impossible
jesus
casts
ridicule
on
the
works
of
the
law
the
washing
of
hands
and
vessels
the
tithing
of
mint
and
cummin
the
abstinence
even
from
doing
good
on
the
sabbath
against
unfruitful
he
sets
up
another
principle
of
morality
that
of
the
service
of
neighbour
he
rejects
that
lofty
kind
of
goodness
which
says
to
father
and
mother
if
i
dedicate
what
i
might
give
to
you
that
will
be
best
even
for
you
yourselves
he
contends
for
the
weightier
matters
in
the
law
for
the
common
morality
which
sees
its
aim
in
the
furtherance
of
the
of
others
and
which
commends
itself
at
once
to
the
heart
of
every
one
just
this
natural
morality
of
does
he
call
the
law
of
god
that
supernatural
morality
which
thinks
to
outbid
this
he
calls
the
commandment
of
men
thus
religion
ceases
to
be
an
art
which
the
rabbis
and
pharisees
understand
better
than
the
unlearned
people
which
know
nothing
of
the
law
the
arrogance
of
the
school
fares
ill
at
the
hands
of
jesus
he
will
know
nothing
of
the
partisanship
of
piety
or
of
the
separateness
of
the
godly
he
condemns
the
practice
of
judging
a
man
value
before
god
holiness
shrinks
from
contact
with
sinners
but
he
helps
the
world
of
misery
and
sin
and
there
is
no
commandment
on
which
he
insists
more
than
that
of
forgiving
others
their
debts
as
one
hopes
for
forgiveness
himself
from
heaven
he
is
most
distinctly
opposed
to
judaism
in
his
view
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
not
as
merely
the
future
reward
of
the
worker
but
as
the
present
goal
of
effort
it
being
the
supreme
duty
of
man
to
help
it
to
realise
itself
on
earth
from
the
individual
outwards
love
is
the
means
and
the
community
of
love
the
end
is
the
chief
demand
of
the
gospel
it
means
the
same
thing
as
that
repentance
which
must
precede
entrance
into
the
kingdom
of
god
the
will
thereby
breaks
away
from
the
chain
of
its
own
acts
and
makes
an
absolutely
new
beginning
not
conditioned
by
the
past
the
causal
nexus
which
admits
of
being
traced
comes
here
to
an
end
and
the
mutual
action
which
can
not
be
analysed
between
god
and
the
soul
begins
miracle
does
not
require
to
be
understood
only
to
be
believed
in
order
to
take
place
with
men
it
is
impossible
but
with
god
it
is
possible
jesus
not
only
affirmed
this
but
proved
it
in
his
own
person
the
impression
of
his
personality
convinced
the
disciples
of
the
fact
of
the
forgiveness
of
their
sins
and
of
their
second
birth
and
gave
them
courage
to
believe
in
a
new
divine
life
and
to
live
it
he
had
in
fact
lost
his
life
and
saved
it
he
could
do
as
he
would
he
had
escaped
the
limits
of
the
race
and
the
pains
of
nature
he
had
found
freedom
and
personality
in
god
who
alone
is
master
of
himself
and
lifts
those
up
to
himself
who
seek
after
him
jesus
works
in
the
world
and
for
the
world
but
with
his
faith
he
stands
above
the
world
and
outside
it
he
can
sacrifice
himself
for
the
world
because
he
asks
nothing
from
the
world
but
has
attained
in
retirement
with
god
to
equanimity
and
peace
of
soul
and
further
the
entirely
position
at
which
jesus
finds
courage
and
love
to
take
an
interest
in
the
world
does
not
lead
him
to
anything
strained
or
unnatural
he
trusts
providence
and
resigns
himself
to
his
will
he
takes
up
the
attitude
of
a
child
towards
him
and
loves
best
to
call
him
the
heavenly
father
the
expression
is
simple
but
the
thing
signified
is
new
he
first
knows
himself
not
in
emotion
but
in
sober
quietness
to
be
god
child
before
him
no
one
ever
felt
himself
to
be
so
or
called
himself
so
he
is
the
of
the
father
yet
according
to
his
own
view
a
among
many
brethren
for
he
stands
in
this
relation
to
god
not
because
his
nature
is
unique
but
because
he
is
man
he
uses
always
and
emphatically
this
general
name
of
the
race
to
designate
his
own
person
in
finding
the
way
to
god
for
himself
he
has
opened
it
to
all
along
with
the
nature
of
god
he
has
at
the
same
time
discovered
in
himself
the
nature
of
man
eternity
extends
into
the
present
with
him
even
on
earth
he
lives
in
the
midst
of
the
kingdom
of
god
even
the
judgment
he
sees
inwardly
accomplished
here
below
in
the
soul
of
man
yet
he
is
far
from
holding
the
opinion
that
he
who
loves
god
aright
does
not
desire
that
god
should
love
him
in
return
he
teaches
men
to
bear
the
cross
but
he
does
not
teach
that
the
cross
is
sweet
and
that
sickness
is
sound
a
coming
reconciliation
between
believing
and
seeing
between
morality
and
nature
everywhere
forms
the
background
of
his
view
of
the
world
even
if
he
could
have
done
without
it
for
his
own
person
yet
it
is
a
thing
he
takes
for
granted
as
it
is
an
objective
demand
of
righteousness
so
much
is
certain
for
the
rest
the
eschatology
of
the
new
testament
is
so
thoroughly
saturated
with
the
jewish
ideas
of
the
disciples
that
it
is
difficult
to
know
what
of
it
is
genuine
jesus
was
so
full
of
new
and
positive
ideas
that
he
did
not
feel
any
need
for
breaking
old
idols
so
free
that
no
constraint
could
depress
him
so
unconquerable
that
even
under
the
load
of
the
greatest
accumulations
of
rubbish
he
could
still
breathe
this
ought
ye
to
do
he
said
and
not
to
leave
the
other
undone
he
did
not
seek
to
take
away
one
iota
but
only
to
fulfil
he
never
thought
of
leaving
the
jewish
community
the
church
is
not
his
work
but
an
inheritance
from
judaism
to
christianity
under
the
persian
domination
the
jews
built
up
an
unpolitical
community
on
the
basis
of
religion
the
christians
found
themselves
in
a
position
with
regard
to
the
roman
empire
precisely
similar
to
that
which
the
jews
had
occupied
with
regard
to
the
persian
and
so
they
also
founded
after
the
jewish
pattern
in
the
midst
of
the
state
which
was
foreign
and
hostile
to
them
and
in
which
they
could
not
feel
themselves
at
home
a
religious
community
as
their
true
fatherland
the
state
is
always
the
presupposition
of
the
church
but
it
was
at
first
in
the
case
both
of
the
jewish
and
of
the
christian
church
a
foreign
state
the
original
meaning
of
the
church
thus
disappeared
when
it
no
longer
stood
over
against
the
heathen
it
having
become
possible
for
the
christians
also
to
possess
a
natural
fatherland
in
the
nation
in
this
way
it
became
much
more
difficult
to
define
accurately
the
spheres
of
the
state
and
the
church
respectively
regarding
the
church
as
an
organisation
not
as
an
invisible
community
of
the
faithful
the
distinction
of
religious
and
secular
is
a
variable
one
every
formation
of
a
religious
community
is
a
step
towards
the
secularisation
of
religion
the
religion
of
the
heart
alone
remains
an
inward
thing
the
tasks
of
the
two
competing
organisations
are
not
radically
different
in
their
nature
on
the
one
side
it
may
be
said
that
had
not
the
christian
religion
found
civil
order
already
in
existence
had
it
come
like
islam
in
contact
with
the
anarchy
of
arabia
instead
of
the
empire
of
rome
it
must
have
founded
not
the
church
but
the
state
on
the
other
side
it
is
well
known
that
the
state
has
everywhere
entered
into
possession
of
fields
first
reclaimed
to
cultivation
by
the
church
now
we
must
acknowledge
that
the
nation
is
more
certainly
created
by
god
than
the
church
and
that
god
works
more
powerfully
in
the
history
of
the
nations
than
in
church
history
the
church
at
first
a
substitute
for
the
nation
which
was
wanting
is
affected
by
the
same
evils
incident
to
an
artificial
cultivation
as
meet
us
in
judaism
we
can
not
create
for
ourselves
our
sphere
of
life
and
action
better
that
it
should
be
a
natural
one
given
by
god
and
yet
it
would
be
unjust
to
deny
the
permanent
advantages
of
the
differentiation
of
the
two
the
church
will
always
be
able
to
work
in
advance
for
the
state
of
the
future
the
present
state
unfortunately
is
in
many
respects
only
nothing
more
than
a
barrier
to
chaos
if
the
church
has
still
a
task
it
is
that
of
preparing
an
inner
unity
of
practical
conviction
and
awakening
a
sentiment
first
in
small
circles
that
we
belong
to
each
other
whether
she
is
to
succeed
in
this
task
is
certainly
the
question
the
religious
individualism
of
the
gospel
is
and
must
remain
for
all
time
the
true
salt
of
the
earth
the
certainty
that
neither
death
nor
life
can
separate
us
from
the
love
of
god
drives
out
that
fear
which
is
opposed
to
love
an
entirely
faith
lends
courage
for
resultless
and
resigned
obedience
on
earth
we
must
succeed
the
hellenistic
period
palestine
fell
into
alexander
possession
in
after
his
death
it
had
an
ample
share
of
the
troubles
arising
out
of
the
partition
of
his
inheritance
in
it
was
seized
by
ptolemy
who
on
a
took
jerusalem
but
in
he
had
to
give
way
before
antigonus
even
before
the
battle
of
ipsus
however
he
recovered
possession
once
more
and
for
a
century
thereafter
southern
syria
continued
to
belong
to
the
egyptian
crown
although
the
seleucidae
more
than
once
sought
to
wrench
it
away
in
the
priestly
dynasty
during
the
period
of
the
ptolemies
onias
ben
jaddua
was
succeeded
by
his
son
simon
after
whom
again
came
first
his
brothers
eleazar
and
manasseh
and
next
his
son
onias
ii
the
was
in
his
turn
followed
by
his
son
simon
whose
praises
are
sung
by
the
son
of
sirach
xlix
at
the
side
of
the
high
priest
stood
the
gerusia
of
the
town
of
jerusalem
as
a
council
of
state
including
the
higher
ranks
of
the
priesthood
the
new
sovereign
power
was
at
once
stronger
and
juster
than
the
persian
at
least
under
the
earlier
ptolemies
the
power
of
the
national
government
increased
to
it
was
intrusted
the
business
of
raising
the
tribute
as
a
consequence
of
the
revolutionary
changes
which
had
taken
place
in
the
conditions
of
the
whole
east
the
jewish
dispersion
diaspora
began
vigorously
to
spread
it
dated
its
beginning
indeed
from
an
earlier
period
from
the
time
when
the
jews
had
lost
their
land
and
kingdom
but
yet
thanks
to
their
religion
could
not
part
with
their
nationality
they
did
not
by
any
means
all
return
from
babylon
perhaps
the
majority
permanently
settled
abroad
the
successors
of
alexander
diadochi
fully
appreciated
this
international
element
and
used
it
as
a
link
between
their
barbarian
and
hellenic
populations
everywhere
they
encouraged
the
settlement
of
jews
in
asia
minor
in
syria
and
especially
in
egypt
alongside
of
the
palestinian
there
arose
a
hellenistic
judaism
which
had
its
metropolis
in
alexandria
here
under
ptolemy
and
the
torah
had
already
been
translated
into
greek
and
around
this
sprung
up
a
literature
which
soon
became
very
extensive
at
the
court
and
in
the
army
of
the
ptolemies
many
jews
rose
to
prominent
positions
everywhere
they
received
the
preference
over
and
everywhere
they
in
consequence
earned
the
hatred
of
the
indigenous
population
after
the
death
of
ptolemy
iv
antiochus
iii
attained
the
object
towards
which
he
and
his
predecessors
had
long
been
vainly
striving
after
a
war
protracted
with
varying
success
through
several
years
he
succeeded
at
last
in
incorporating
palestine
with
the
kingdom
of
the
seleucidae
the
jews
took
his
side
less
perhaps
because
they
had
become
disgusted
with
the
really
sadly
degenerate
egyptian
rule
than
because
they
had
foreseen
the
issue
of
the
contest
and
preferred
to
attach
themselves
voluntarily
to
the
winning
side
in
grateful
acknowledgment
antiochus
confirmed
and
enlarged
certain
privileges
of
the
holy
camp
of
jerusalem
josephus

xii
it
soon
however
became
manifest
that
the
jews
had
made
but
a
poor
bargain
in
this
exchange
three
years
after
his
defeat
at
magnesia
antiochus
iii
died
leaving
to
his
son
seleucus
iv
an
immense
burden
of
debt
which
he
had
incurred
by
his
unprosperous
roman
war
seleucus
in
his
straits
could
not
afford
to
be
in
appropriating
money
where
it
was
to
be
found
he
did
not
need
to
be
twice
told
that
the
wealth
of
the
temple
at
jerusalem
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
expenses
of
the
sacrificial
service
the
sacred
treasure
accordingly
made
the
narrowest
possible
escape
from
being
plundered
heliodorus
who
had
been
charged
by
the
king
to
seize
it
was
deterred
at
the
last
moment
by
a
heavenly
vision
but
the
jews
derived
no
permanent
advantage
from
this
it
was
a
priest
of
rank
simon
by
name
who
had
called
the
attention
of
the
king
to
the
temple
treasure
his
motive
had
been
spite
against
the
high
priest
onias
the
son
and
successor
of
simon
ii
the
circumstance
is
one
indication
of
a
melancholy
process
of
disintegration
that
was
at
that
time
going
on
within
the
hierocracy
the
although
there
were
exceptional
cases
such
as
that
of
simon
was
regarded
less
as
a
sacred
office
than
as
a
profitable
princedom
within
the
ranks
of
the
priestly
nobility
arose
envious
and
jealous
factions
personal
advancement
was
sought
by
means
of
the
favour
of
the
overlord
who
had
something
to
say
in
the
making
of
appointments
a
collateral
branch
of
the
ruling
family
that
of
the
children
of
tobias
had
by
means
of
the
wealth
of
joseph
ben
tobias
attained
to
a
position
of
ascendancy
and
competed
in
point
of
power
with
the
high
priest
himself
it
appears
that
the
simon
and
his
still
more
scandalous
brother
aienelaus
also
belonged
to
the
tobiadae
and
relying
upon
the
support
of
their
powerful
party
josephus
antiquities
xii
cherished
the
purpose
of
securing
the
by
the
aid
of
the
syrian
king
the
failure
of
the
mission
of
heliodorus
was
attributed
by
simon
to
a
piece
of
trickery
on
the
part
of
onias
the
high
priest
who
accordingly
found
himself
called
upon
to
make
his
own
justification
at
court
and
to
expose
the
intrigues
of
his
adversary
meanwhile
seleucus
iv
died
of
poison
and
antiochus
iv
epiphanes
did
not
confirm
onias
in
his
dignity
but
detained
him
in
antioch
while
he
made
over
the
office
to
his
brother
jason
who
had
offered
a
higher
rent
possibly
the
tobiadae
also
had
something
to
do
with
this
arrangement
at
all
events
menelaus
was
at
the
outset
the
right
hand
of
the
new
high
priest
to
secure
still
further
the
favour
of
the
king
jason
held
himself
out
to
be
an
enlightened
friend
of
the
greeks
and
begged
for
leave
to
found
in
jerusalem
a
gymnasium
and
an
ephebeum
and
to
be
allowed
to
sell
to
the
inhabitants
there
the
rights
of
citizenship
in
antioch
a
request
which
was
readily
granted
the
malady
which
had
long
been
incubating
now
reached
its
acute
phase
just
in
proportion
as
hellenism
showed
itself
friendly
did
it
present
elements
of
danger
to
judaism
from
the
periphery
it
slowly
advanced
towards
the
centre
from
the
diaspora
to
jerusalem
from
mere
matters
of
external
fashion
to
matters
of
the
most
profound
conviction
especially
did
the
upper
and
cultivated
the
hellenising
fashion
is
amusingly
exemplified
in
the
grecising
of
the
jewish
names
alcimus
eljakim
jason
jesus
joshua
menelaus
menahem
classes
of
society
begin
to
feel
ashamed
in
presence
of
the
refined
greeks
of
their
jewish
singularity
and
to
do
all
in
their
power
to
tone
it
down
and
conceal
it
in
this
the
priestly
nobility
made
itself
conspicuous
as
the
most
secular
section
of
the
community
and
it
was
the
high
priest
who
took
the
initiative
in
measures
which
aimed
at
a
complete
hellenising
of
the
jews
he
outdid
every
one
else
in
paganism
once
he
sent
a
considerable
present
for
offerings
to
the
syrian
hercules
on
the
occasion
of
his
festival
but
his
messenger
ashamed
to
apply
the
money
to
such
a
purpose
set
it
apart
for
the
construction
of
royal
ships
of
war
the
friendship
shown
by
jason
for
the
greek
king
and
for
all
that
was
hellenic
did
not
prevent
antiochus
iv
from
setting
pecuniary
considerations
before
all
others
menelaus
intrusted
with
the
mission
of
conveying
to
antioch
the
annual
jewish
tribute
availed
himself
of
the
opportunity
to
promote
his
own
personal
interests
by
offering
a
higher
sum
for
the
and
having
otherwise
ingratiated
himself
with
the
king
gained
his
object
but
though
nominated
he
did
not
find
it
quite
easy
to
obtain
possession
of
the
post
the
tobiadae
took
his
side
but
the
body
of
the
people
stuck
to
jason
who
was
compelled
to
give
way
only
when
syrian
troops
had
been
brought
upon
the
scene
menelaus
had
immediately
however
to
encounter
another
difficulty
for
he
could
not
at
once
pay
the
amount
of
tribute
which
he
had
promised
he
helped
himself
so
far
indeed
by
robbing
the
temple
but
this
landed
him
in
new
embarrassments
onias
who
was
living
out
of
employment
at
antioch
threatened
to
make
compromising
revelations
to
the
king
he
was
however
opportunely
assassinated
the
rage
of
the
people
against
the
priestly
now
broke
out
in
a
rising
against
a
certain
lysimachus
who
at
the
instance
of
the
absent
menelaus
had
made
further
inroads
upon
the
sacred
treasury
the
jews
defence
before
the
king
at
tyre
on
account
of
this
uproar
resolved
itself
into
a
grievous
complaint
against
the
conduct
of
menelaus
his
case
was
a
bad
one
but
money
again
helped
him
out
of
his
straits
and
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law
fell
upon
his
accusers
the
feelings
of
the
jews
with
reference
to
this
wolfish
shepherd
may
easily
be
imagined
nothing
but
fear
of
antiochus
held
them
in
check
then
a
report
gained
currency
that
the
king
had
perished
in
an
expedition
against
egypt
and
jason
who
meanwhile
had
found
refuge
in
ammanitis
availed
himself
of
the
prevailing
current
of
feeling
to
resume
his
authority
with
the
help
of
one
thousand
men
he
was
not
able
however
to
hold
the
position
long
partly
because
he
showed
an
unwise
vindictiveness
against
his
enemies
partly
and
chiefly
because
the
rumour
of
the
death
of
antiochus
turned
out
to
be
false
the
king
was
already
in
fact
close
at
hand
on
his
return
from
egypt
full
of
anger
at
an
insurrection
which
he
regarded
as
having
been
directed
against
himself
he
inflicted
severe
and
bloody
chastisement
upon
jerusalem
carried
off
the
treasures
of
the
temple
and
restored
menelaus
placing
syrian
officials
at
his
side
jason
fled
from
place
to
place
and
ultimately
died
in
misery
at
lacedaemon
the
deepest
despondency
prevailed
in
judaea
but
its
cup
of
sorrow
was
not
yet
full
antiochus
probably
soon
after
his
last
egyptian
expedition
sent
apollonius
with
an
army
against
jerusalem
he
fell
upon
the
unsuspecting
city
disarmed
the
inhabitants
and
demolished
the
walls
but
on
the
other
hand
fortified
acra
and
garrisoned
it
strongly
so
as
to
make
it
a
standing
menace
to
the
whole
country
having
thus
made
his
preparations
he
proceeded
to
carry
out
his
main
instructions
all
that
was
religiously
distinctive
of
judaism
was
to
be
removed
such
was
the
will
of
the
king
the
mosaic
cultus
was
abolished
sabbath
observance
and
the
rite
of
circumcision
prohibited
all
copies
of
the
torah
confiscated
and
burnt
in
the
desecrated
and
temple
pagan
ceremonies
were
performed
and
upon
the
great
altar
of
a
small
altar
to
jupiter
capitolinus
was
erected
on
which
the
first
offering
was
made
on
kislev
in
the
country
towns
also
heathen
altars
were
erected
and
the
jews
compelled
on
pain
of
death
publicly
to
adore
the
false
gods
and
to
eat
swine
flesh
that
had
been
sacrificed
to
idols
the
princes
and
grandees
of
the
jews
had
represented
to
antiochus
that
the
people
were
ripe
for
hellenisation
and
inasmuch
as
apart
from
this
to
reduce
to
uniformity
the
extremely
motley
constituents
of
his
kingdom
was
a
scheme
that
lay
near
his
heart
he
was
very
willing
to
believe
them
that
the
very
opposite
was
the
case
must
of
course
have
become
quite
evident
very
soon
but
the
resistance
of
the
jews
taking
the
form
of
rebellious
risings
against
his
creatures
he
fell
upon
the
hopeless
plan
of
coercion
hopeless
for
he
could
attain
his
end
only
by
making
all
judaea
one
vast
graveyard
there
existed
indeed
a
pagan
party
the
syrian
garrison
of
acra
was
partly
composed
of
jews
who
sold
themselves
to
be
the
executioners
of
their
countrymen
fear
also
influenced
many
to
deny
their
convictions
but
the
majority
adhered
firmly
to
the
religion
of
their
fathers
jerusalem
the
centre
of
the
process
of
hellenisation
was
abandoned
by
its
inhabitants
who
made
their
escape
to
egypt
or
hid
themselves
in
the
country
in
deserts
and
caves
the
scribes
in
especial
held
fast
by
the
law
and
they
were
joined
by
the
party
of
the
asidaeans
pious
ones
the
hasmonaeans
at
first
there
was
no
thought
of
meeting
violence
with
violence
as
the
book
of
daniel
shows
people
consoled
themselves
with
thoughts
of
the
immediate
intervention
of
god
which
would
occur
in
due
time
quite
casually
without
either
plan
or
concert
a
warlike
opposition
arose
there
was
a
certain
priest
mattathias
of
the
family
of
the
hasmonaeans
a
man
far
advanced
in
life
whose
home
was
in
modein
a
little
country
town
to
the
west
of
jerusalem
hither
also
the
syrian
soldiers
came
to
put
the
population
to
a
positive
proof
of
their
change
of
faith
they
insisted
upon
mattathias
leading
the
way
but
he
was
steadfast
in
his
refusal
and
when
another
jew
addressed
himself
before
his
eyes
to
the
work
of
making
the
heathen
offering
he
killed
him
and
the
syrian
officer
as
well
and
destroyed
the
altar
thereupon
he
fled
to
the
hill
country
accompanied
by
his
sons
johannes
gaddi
simon
thassi
judas
maccabaeus
eleazar
auaran
jonathan
apphus
and
other
followers
but
he
resolved
to
defend
himself
to
the
last
and
not
to
act
as
some
other
fugitives
had
done
who
about
the
same
time
had
allowed
themselves
to
be
surrounded
and
butchered
on
a
without
lifting
a
finger
thus
he
became
the
head
of
a
band
which
defended
the
ancestral
religion
with
the
sword
they
traversed
the
country
demolished
the
altars
of
the
false
gods
circumcised
the
children
and
persecuted
the
heathen
and
heathenishly
disposed
the
sect
of
the
asidaeans
also
intrusted
itself
to
their
warlike
protection
ii
mattathias
soon
died
and
left
his
leadership
to
judas
maccabaeus
by
whom
the
struggle
was
carried
on
in
the
first
instance
after
the
old
fashion
soon
however
it
assumed
larger
dimensions
when
regular
armies
were
sent
out
against
the
insurgents
first
apollonius
the
governor
of
judaea
took
the
field
but
he
was
defeated
and
fell
in
battle
next
came
seron
governor
of
ccelesyria
who
also
was
routed
near
bethhoron
upon
this
lysias
the
regent
to
whom
antiochus
who
was
busied
in
the
far
east
had
intrusted
the
government
of
syria
and
the
charge
of
his
son
antiochus
philopator
a
minor
sent
a
strong
force
under
the
command
of
three
generals
approaching
from
the
west
it
was
their
design
to
advance
separately
upon
jerusalem
but
judas
anticipated
their
plan
and
compelled
them
to
quit
the
field
the
regent
now
felt
himself
called
on
to
interpose
in
person
invading
judaea
from
the
south
he
encountered
the
jews
at
bethsur
who
however
offered
an
opposition
that
was
not
easily
overcome
he
was
prevented
from
resorting
to
the
last
measures
by
the
intelligence
which
reached
him
of
the
death
of
the
king
in
elymais
the
withdrawal
of
lysias
secured
the
fulfilment
of
the
desires
of
the
defenders
of
the
faith
in
so
far
as
it
now
enabled
them
to
restore
the
jerusalem
worship
to
its
previous
condition
they
lost
no
time
in
setting
about
the
accomplishment
of
this
they
were
not
successful
indeed
in
wresting
acra
from
the
possession
of
the
syrians
but
they
so
occupied
the
garrison
as
to
prevent
it
from
interfering
with
the
work
of
restoration
on
kislev
the
very
day
on
which
three
years
before
the
abomination
of
desolation
had
been
inaugurated
the
first
sacrifice
was
offered
on
the
new
altar
and
in
commemoration
of
this
the
feast
of
the
dedication
was
thenceforth
celebrated
as
it
was
easy
to
see
that
danger
still
impended
the
temple
was
put
into
a
state
of
defence
as
also
was
the
town
of
bethsur
where
lysias
had
been
checked
but
the
favourable
moment
presented
by
the
change
of
sovereign
was
made
use
of
for
still
bolder
attempts
scattered
over
the
whole
of
southern
syria
there
were
a
number
of
jewish
localities
on
which
the
heathens
now
proceeded
to
wreak
their
vengeance
for
the
purpose
of
rescuing
these
oppressed
and
of
bringing
them
in
safety
to
judaea
the
maccabees
made
a
series
of
excursions
extending
in
some
cases
as
far
as
to
lebanon
and
damascus
lysias
had
his
hands
otherwise
fully
occupied
and
perhaps
did
not
feel
much
disposed
to
continue
the
fight
on
behalf
of
the
cultus
of
jupiter
capitolinus
daily
gaining
in
boldness
the
jews
now
took
in
hand
also
to
lay
regular
siege
to
acra
then
at
last
lysias
yielded
to
the
pressure
of
syrian
and
jewish
deputations
and
determined
to
take
serious
steps
with
a
large
force
he
entered
judaea
again
from
the
south
and
laid
siege
to
bethsur
judas
vainly
attempted
the
relief
of
the
fortress
he
sustained
near
bethzachariah
a
defeat
in
which
his
brother
eleazar
perished
bethsur
was
unable
to
hold
out
being
short
of
provisions
on
account
of
the
sabbatic
year
the
syrians
advanced
next
to
jerusalem
and
besieged
the
temple
it
also
was
insufficiently
provisioned
and
would
soon
have
been
compelled
to
surrender
had
not
lysias
been
again
called
away
at
the
critical
moment
by
other
exigencies
a
certain
philip
was
endeavouring
to
oust
him
from
the
regency
as
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
have
his
hands
free
in
dealing
with
this
new
enemy
he
closed
a
treaty
with
the
temple
garrison
and
the
people
at
large
in
accordance
with
which
at
once
the
political
subjection
and
the
religious
freedom
of
the
jews
were
to
be
maintained
thus
the
situation
as
it
had
existed
before
antiochus
iv
was
restored
only
no
attempt
was
made
to
replace
menelaus
as
high
priest
and
ethnarch
this
post
was
to
be
filled
by
alcimus
the
concessions
thus
made
by
lysias
were
inevitable
and
even
king
demetrius
son
of
seleucus
who
towards
the
end
of
ascended
the
throne
and
caused
both
lysias
and
his
ward
to
be
put
to
death
had
no
thought
of
interfering
with
their
religious
freedom
but
the
maccabees
desired
something
more
than
the
quo
after
having
done
their
duty
they
were
disinclined
to
retire
in
favour
of
alcimus
whose
sole
claim
lay
in
his
descent
from
the
old
family
alcimus
was
compelled
to
invoke
the
assistance
of
the
king
who
caused
him
to
be
installed
by
bacchides
he
was
at
once
recognised
by
the
scribes
and
asidaeans
for
whom
with
religious
liberty
everything
they
wished
had
been
secured
the
claims
to
supremacy
made
by
the
hasmonaeans
were
of
no
consequence
to
them
doubtless
the
masses
also
would
ultimately
have
quietly
accepted
alcimus
who
of
course
refrained
from
interference
with
either
law
or
worship
had
he
not
abused
the
momentary
power
he
derived
from
the
presence
of
bacchides
to
take
a
foolish
revenge
but
the
consequence
of
his
action
was
that
as
soon
as
bacchides
had
turned
his
back
alcimus
was
compelled
to
follow
him
for
the
purpose
of
restoring
him
a
syrian
army
once
more
invaded
judaea
under
nicanor
but
first
at
kapharsalama
and
afterwards
at
bethhoron
was
defeated
by
judas
and
almost
annihilated
in
the
subsequent
flight
nicanor
himself
being
among
the
slain
adar
nicanor
day
judas
was
now
at
the
acme
of
his
prosperity
about
this
time
he
concluded
his
profitless
treaty
with
the
romans
but
disaster
was
impending
in
the
month
of
nisan
barely
a
month
after
the
defeat
of
nicanor
a
new
syrian
army
under
bacchides
entered
judaea
from
the
north
near
elasa
southward
from
jerusalem
a
decisive
battle
was
fought
which
was
lost
by
judas
and
in
which
he
himself
fell
the
religious
war
properly
so
called
had
already
been
brought
once
for
all
to
an
end
by
the
convention
of
lysias
if
the
struggle
continued
to
be
carried
on
it
was
not
for
the
faith
but
for
the
supremacy
less
in
the
interests
of
the
community
than
in
those
of
the
hasmonaeans
after
the
death
of
judas
the
secular
character
which
the
conflict
had
assumed
ever
since
continually
became
more
conspicuous
jonathan
apphus
fought
for
his
house
and
in
doing
so
used
thoroughly
worldly
means
the
the
ethnarchy
was
the
goal
of
his
ambition
so
long
as
alcimus
lived
it
was
far
from
his
reach
confined
to
the
rocky
fastnesses
beside
the
dead
sea
he
had
nothing
for
it
but
surrounded
by
his
faithful
followers
to
wait
for
better
times
but
on
the
death
of
alcimus
the
syrians
refrained
from
appointing
a
successor
to
obviate
the
necessity
of
always
having
to
protect
him
with
military
force
during
the
interregnum
of
seven
years
which
followed
jonathan
again
came
more
and
more
to
the
front
so
that
at
last
bacchides
concluded
an
armistice
with
him
on
the
basis
of
the
ix
from
his
residence
at
michmash
jonathan
now
exercised
a
authority
over
the
entire
nation
when
accordingly
alexander
balas
a
reputed
son
of
antiochus
rose
against
demetrius
both
rivals
exerted
themselves
to
secure
the
alliance
of
jonathan
who
did
not
fail
to
benefit
by
their
competition
first
of
all
demetrius
formally
recognised
him
as
prince
of
judah
in
consequence
of
this
he
removed
to
jerusalem
and
expelled
the
heathen
and
heathenishly
disposed
who
continued
to
maintain
a
footing
only
in
acra
and
bethsur
next
alexander
balas
conferred
on
him
the
title
of
high
priest
of
the
nation
and
friend
of
the
king
in
gratitude
for
which
jonathan
went
over
to
his
side
he
remained
loya
although
demetrius
now
made
larger
offers
he
was
justified
by
the
event
for
demetrius
had
the
worst
of
it
and
was
slain
the
victorious
balas
heaped
honours
upon
jonathan
who
maintained
his
fidelity
and
fought
successfully
in
his
interests
when
in
demetrius
the
son
of
demetrius
challenged
a
conflict
the
high
priest
was
unable
indeed
to
prevent
the
downfall
of
alexander
in
but
demetrius
won
by
presents
far
from
showing
any
hostility
confirmed
him
in
his
position
in
consideration
of
a
tribute
of
talents
jonathan
was
grateful
to
the
king
as
he
showed
by
going
with
men
to
his
aid
against
the
insurgent
antiochenes
but
when
the
latter
drew
back
from
his
promise
to
withdraw
the
garrison
from
acra
he
went
over
to
the
side
of
trypho
who
had
set
up
a
son
of
alexander
balas
antiochus
as
a
rival
in
the
war
which
he
now
waged
as
against
demetrius
he
succeeded
in
subduing
almost
the
whole
of
palestine
meanwhile
his
brother
simon
remained
behind
in
judaea
mastered
the
fortress
of
bethsur
and
resumed
with
great
energy
the
siege
of
acra
all
this
was
done
in
the
names
of
antiochus
and
trypho
but
really
of
course
in
the
interests
of
the
jews
themselves
there
were
concluded
also
treaties
with
the
romans
and
lacedaemonians
certainly
not
to
the
advantage
of
the
syrians
trypho
sought
now
to
get
rid
of
the
man
whom
he
himself
had
made
so
powerful
he
treacherously
seized
and
imprisoned
jonathan
in
ptolemais
and
meditated
an
attack
upon
the
leaderless
country
but
on
the
frontier
simon
the
last
remaining
son
of
mattathias
met
him
in
force
all
trypho
efforts
to
break
through
proved
futile
after
skirting
all
judaea
from
west
to
south
without
being
able
to
get
clear
of
simon
he
at
last
withdrew
to
peraea
without
having
accomplished
anything
on
the
person
of
jonathan
whom
he
caused
to
be
executed
he
vented
the
spleen
he
felt
on
the
discovery
that
the
cause
for
which
that
prince
had
fought
was
able
to
gain
the
victory
even
when
deprived
of
his
help
simon
in
point
of
fact
was
jonathan
equal
as
a
soldier
and
his
superior
as
a
ruler
he
secured
his
frontier
by
means
of
fortresses
made
himself
master
of
acra
and
understood
how
to
enable
the
people
in
time
of
peace
to
reap
the
advantages
that
result
from
successful
war
agriculture
industry
and
commerce
from
the
haven
of
joppa
began
to
flourish
vigorously
in
grateful
recognition
of
his
services
the
and
the
ethnarchy
were
bestowed
upon
him
as
hereditary
possessions
by
a
solemn
assembly
of
the
people
until
a
trustworthy
prophet
should
arise
nominally
the
seleucidae
still
continued
to
possess
the
suzerainty
simon
naturally
had
detached
himself
from
trypho
and
turned
to
demetrius
who
confirmed
him
in
his
position
remitted
all
arrears
of
tribute
and
waived
his
rights
for
the
future
the
friendship
of
demetrius
ii
and
of
his
successor
antiochus
sidetes
with
simon
however
lasted
only
as
long
as
trypho
still
remained
in
the
way
but
he
once
removed
sidetes
altered
his
policy
he
demanded
of
simon
the
surrender
of
joppa
gazara
and
other
towns
besides
the
citadel
of
jerusalem
as
well
as
payment
of
all
tribute
resting
due
the
refusal
of
these
demands
led
to
war
which
in
its
earlier
stages
was
carried
on
with
success
but
the
scales
were
turned
after
the
murder
of
simon
when
sidetes
in
person
took
the
field
against
john
hyrcanus
simon
son
and
successor
jerusalem
capitulated
in
the
negotiations
for
peace
the
surrender
of
all
the
external
possessions
of
the
jews
was
insisted
upon
the
suzerainty
of
the
syrians
became
once
more
a
reality
but
in
the
powerful
antiochus
sidetes
fell
in
an
expedition
against
the
parthians
and
the
complications
anew
arising
in
reference
to
the
succession
to
the
syrian
throne
placed
hyrcanus
in
a
position
to
recover
what
he
had
lost
and
to
make
new
acquisitions
he
subjugated
samaria
and
idumaea
compelling
the
inhabitants
of
the
latter
to
accept
circumcision
like
his
predecessors
he
too
sought
to
secure
the
favour
of
the
romans
but
derived
no
greater
benefit
from
the
effort
than
they
had
done
after
a
prosperous
reign
of
thirty
years
he
died
in
by
josephus
he
is
represented
as
a
pattern
of
all
that
a
pious
prince
ought
to
be
by
the
rabbins
as
representing
a
splendid
the
darkness
of
the
succeeding
age
lent
a
brighter
colour
to
his
image
the
external
splendour
of
the
hasmonaean
kingdom
did
not
at
once
die
away
the
downfall
of
the
seleucidae
which
was
its
negative
condition
being
also
a
slow
affair
judah
aristobulus
the
son
of
hyrcanus
who
reigned
for
only
one
year
was
the
first
to
assume
the
greek
title
of
royalty
ituraea
was
subdued
by
him
and
circumcision
forced
upon
the
inhabitants
his
brother
jonathan
jannaeus
alexander
in
a
series
of
continual
wars
which
were
never
very
prosperous
succeeded
in
adding
the
whole
coast
of
philistia
gaza
as
well
as
a
great
portion
of
peraea
to
his
hereditary
dominions
a
number
of
towns
and
communes
lay
as
tempting
subjects
of
dispute
between
the
seleucidae
the
nabathaeans
or
arabs
of
petra
and
the
jews
the
background
was
occupied
by
the
parthians
and
the
romans
but
the
external
enlargement
of
the
structure
was
secured
at
the
cost
of
its
internal
consistency
from
the
time
when
jonathan
the
son
of
mattathias
began
to
carry
on
the
struggle
no
longer
for
the
cause
of
god
but
for
his
own
interests
the
scribes
and
the
asidaeans
as
we
have
seen
had
withdrawn
themselves
from
the
party
of
the
maccabees
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
from
their
legal
standpoint
they
were
perfectly
right
in
contenting
themselves
as
they
did
with
the
attainment
of
religious
liberty
and
in
accepting
alcimus
the
hasmonaeans
had
no
hereditary
right
to
the
and
their
politics
which
aimed
at
the
establishment
of
a
national
monarchy
were
contrary
to
the
whole
spirit
and
essence
of
the
second
theocracy
the
presupposition
of
that
theocracy
was
foreign
domination
in
no
other
way
could
its
sacred
clerical
character
be
maintained
god
and
the
law
could
not
but
be
forced
into
the
background
if
a
warlike
kingdom
retaining
indeed
the
forms
of
a
hierocracy
but
really
violating
its
spirit
at
every
point
should
ever
grow
out
of
a
mere
pious
community
above
all
how
could
the
scribes
hope
to
retain
their
importance
if
temple
and
synagogue
were
cast
into
the
shade
by
politics
and
clash
of
arms
but
under
the
first
great
hasmonaeans
the
zealots
for
the
law
were
unable
to
force
their
way
to
the
front
the
enthusiasm
of
the
people
was
too
strong
for
them
they
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
keep
themselves
out
of
the
current
and
refuse
to
be
swept
along
by
it
even
under
hyrcanus
however
they
gained
more
prominence
and
under
jannaeus
their
influence
upon
popular
opinion
was
paramount
for
under
the
the
secularisation
of
the
hierocracy
no
longer
presented
any
attractive
aspects
it
was
wholly
repellent
it
was
looked
upon
as
a
revolting
anomaly
that
the
king
who
was
usually
in
the
field
with
his
army
should
once
and
again
assume
the
sacred
mantle
in
order
to
perform
the
sacrifice
on
some
high
festival
and
that
his
officers
profane
persons
as
they
were
should
at
the
same
time
be
holders
of
the
highest
spiritual
offices
the
danger
which
in
all
this
threatened
the
idea
of
judaism
could
not
in
these
circumstances
escape
the
observation
of
even
the
common
people
for
this
idea
was
god
and
the
law
not
any
earthly
fatherland
the
masses
accordingly
ranged
themselves
with
unanimity
on
the
side
of
the
pharisees
the
party
of
the
scribes

against
the
sadducees

party

continued
to

he
wished
first
to
have

disposed

to
have

through

this
hesitation
roused
the
suspicions
of
aristobulus
still
he
did
not
venture
to
take
decisive
action
upon
them
he
closed
the
passes
to
mount
ephraim
against
the
romans
but
afterwards
gave
them
up
he
prepared
jerusalem
for

and
then
went

at

he
promised
to
open

the

between

continued
indeed
to
be
carried
on
but
only
because
the
momentum
of
their
old
feud
was
not
yet
exhausted
the
pharisees
in
a
sense
had
been
victorious
while
the
two
brothers
were
pleading
their
rival
claims
before
pompey
ambassadors
from
the
pharisees
had
made
their
appearance
in
damascus
to
petition
for
the
abolition
of
the

this
object
had
now
to
some
extent
been
gained
less
ambiguous
than
the
victory
of
the
pharisees
was
the
fall
of
the
sadducees
who
in
losing
the
sovereignty
of
the
jewish
state
lost
all
real
importance
but
the
intervention
of

element
exercised
its

temper

in
times

the

still
continued

instantly
burst

not
regarded
as
a

at

merely
as
the

by

he
earned
the
of

in

setting

external
relations

each
new
phase
in
his
political
position
immediately
made
itself

at

in

he
had
much
to
suffer
from

would
willingly
have
seen

who
actually
succeeded

him

he
reaped
nothing

advantage
from
the
great
overturn

took
place

it
rid
him

to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
emperor
he
founded
cities
and
harbours
antipatris
caesarea
constructed
roads
theatres
and
temples
and
subsidised
far
beyond
his
frontier
all
works
of
public
utility
he
taxed
the
jews
heavily
but
in
compensation
promoted
their
material
interests
with
energy
and
discretion
and
built
for
them
from
or
onwards
the
temple
at
jerusalem
to
gain
their
sympathies
he
well
knew
to
be
impossible
apart
from
the
roman
legions
at
his
back
his
authority
had
its
main
support
in
his
fortresses
and
in
his
system
of
espionage
but
just
as
the
acme
of
his
splendour
had
been
reached
he
himself
became
the
instrument
of
a
terrible
vengeance
for
the
crimes
by
which
his
previous
years
had
been
stained
as
executioner
of
all
the
hasmonaeans
he
was
now
constrained
to
be
the
executioner
of
his
own
children
also
his
suspicious
temper
had
been
aroused
against
his
now
sons
by
mariamne
whose
claims
through
their
mother
to
the
throne
were
superior
to
his
own
his
brother
pheroras
and
his
sister
salome
made
it
their
special
business
to
fan
his
jealousy
into
flame
to
show
the
two
somewhat
arrogant
youths
that
the
succession
was
not
so
absolutely
secure
in
their
favour
as
they
were
supposing
the
father
summoned
to
his
court
antipater
the
exiled
son
of
a
former
marriage
antipater
under
the
mask
of
friendship
immediately
began
to
carry
on
infamous
intrigues
against
his
half
brothers
in
which
pheroras
and
salome
unconsciously
played
into
his
hands
for
years
he
persevered
alike
in
favouring
and
unfavouring
circumstances
with
his
part
until
at
last
by
the
machinations
of
a
lacedemonian
eurycles
who
had
been
bribed
herod
was
induced
to
condemn
the
sons
of
mariamne
at
berytus
and
cause
them
to
be
strangled
samaria
not
long
afterwards
a
difference
between
antipater
and
salome
led
to
the
exposure
of
the
former
herod
was
compelled
to
drain
the
cup
to
the
dregs
he
was
not
spared
the
knowledge
that
he
had
murdered
his
children
without
a
cause
his
remorse
threw
him
into
a
serious
illness
in
which
his
strong
constitution
wrestled
long
with
death
while
he
lay
at
jericho
near
his
end
he
gave
orders
for
the
execution
of
antipater
also
and
to
embitter
the
joy
of
the
jews
at
his
removal
he
caused
their
elders
to
be
shut
up
together
in
the
hippodrome
at
jericho
with
the
injunction
to
butcher
them
as
soon
as
he
breathed
his
last
that
so
there
might
be
sorrow
throughout
the
land
the
latter
order
however
was
not
carried
out
his
death
gave
the
signal
for
an
insurrection
of
small
beginnings
which
gradually
spread
until
it
ultimately
infected
all
the
people
it
was
repressed
by
varus
with
great
cruelty
meanwhile
herod
connexions
were
at
rome
disputing
about
the
inheritance
the
deceased
king
who
was
survived
by
several
children
of
various
marriages
had
made
a
will
which
was
substantially
confirmed
by
augustus
by
it
his
son
philip
received
the
northern
portion
of
the
territory
on
the
east
of
the
jordan
along
with
the
district
of
paneas
caesarea
philippi
his
years
reign
over
this
region
was
happy
another
son
herod
antipas
obtained
galilee
and
peraea
he
beautified
his
domains
with
architectural
works
sepphoris
tiberias
livias
machaerus
and
succeeded
by
his
policy
in
ingratiating
himself
with
the
emperors
particularly
with
tiberius
for
that
very
cause
however
becoming
odious
to
the
roman
provincial
officials
the
principal
heir
was
archelaus
to
whom
idumaea
judaea
and
samaritis
were
allotted
augustus
at
first
refused
him
the
title
of
king
archelaus
had
experienced
the
greatest
difficulty
in
carrying
through
his
claims
before
the
emperor
in
face
of
the
manifold
oppositions
of
his
enemies
the
vengeance
which
he
wreaked
upon
his
subjects
was
so
severe
that
in
a
d
a
jewish
and
samaritan
embassy
besought
the
emperor
for
his
deposition
augustus
assented
banishing
archelaus
to
vienne
and
putting
in
his
place
a
roman
procurator
thenceforward
judaea
continued
under
procurators
with
the
exception
of
a
brief
interval
during
which
herod
agrippa
united
under
his
sway
all
the
dominions
of
his
grandfather
agrippa
was
the
grandson
of
mariamne
through
aristobulus
caligula
whose
friendship
he
had
secured
in
rome
bestowed
upon
him
in
the
dominions
of
philip
with
the
title
of
king
and
afterwards
the
tetrarchy
of
antipas
whom
he
deposed
and
banished
to
lugdunum
claudius
added
the
possessions
of
archelaus
but
the
kingdom
was
again
taken
away
from
his
son
agrippa
ii
who
however
after
the
death
of
his
uncle
herod
of
chalcis
obtained
that
principality
for
which
at
a
later
period
the
tetrarchy
of
philip
was
substituted
his
sister
berenice
is
known
as
the
mistress
of
titus
another
sister
drusilla
was
the
wife
of
the

the
descendants
of

for
some
time
an
armenian
principality
the
termination
of
the
vassal
kingship
resulted
in
manifest
advantage
to
the
sadducees
the
high
priest
and
synedrium
again
acquired
political
importance
they
were
the
responsible
representatives
of
the
nation
in
presence
of
the
suzerain
power
and
conceived
themselves
to
be
in
some
sort

john
xi
for
the
pharisees
the
new
state
of
affairs
appears
to
have
been
less
satisfactory
that
the
romans
were
much
less
oppressive
to
the
jews
than
the
rulers
of
the
house
of
herod
was
a
consideration
of
less
importance
to
them
than
the
fact
that
the
heathen
first
unintentionally
and
then
deliberately
were
guilty
of
the
rudest
outrages
upon
the
law
outrages
against
which
those
sly
had
well
understood
how
to
be
on
their
guard
it
was
among
the
lower
ranks
of
the
people
however
that
hatred
to
the
romans
had
its
proper
seat
on
the
basis
of
the
views
and
tendencies
which
had
long
prevailed
there
a
new
party
was
now
formed
that
of
the
zealots
which
did
not
like
the
pharisees
aim
merely
at
the
fulfilment
of
all
righteousness
of
the
law
and
leave
everything
else
in
the
hands
of
god
but
was
determined
to
take
an
active
part
in
bringing
about
the
realisation
of
the
kingdom
of
god
josephus
antiquities
xviii
as
the
transition
to
the
new
order
of
things
was
going
on
the
census
of
quirinius
took
place
it
occasioned
an
immense
excitement
which
however
was
successfully
allayed
on
the
withdrawal
of
quirinius
coponius
remained
behind
as
procurator
of
judaea
he
was
followed
under
augustus
by
marcus
ambivius
and
annius
rufus
under
tiberius
by
valerius
gratus
and
pontius
pilatus
under
caligula
by
marcellus
and
marullus
the
procurators
were
subordinate
to
the
imperial
legati
of
syria
they
resided
in
caesarea
and
visited
jerusalem
on
special
occasions
only
they
had
command
of
the
military
and
their
chief
business
was
the
maintenance
of
the
peace
and
the
care
of
the
revenue
they
interested
themselves
in
affairs
of
religion
only
in
so
far
as
these
had
a
political
side
the
temple
citadel
antonia
was
constantly
garrisoned
with
a
cohort
the
administration
of
justice
appears
to
have
been
left
to
a
very
considerable
extent
in
the
hands
of
the
synedrium
but
it
was
not
allowed
to
give
effect
to
any
capital
sentence
at
the
head
of
the
native
authorities
stood
at
this
time
not
so
much
the
actual
high
priest
as
the
college
of
the
chief
priests
the
actual
office
of
high
priest
had
lost
its
political
importance
in
consequence
of
the
frequency
with
which
its
holders
were
changed
thus
for
example
annas
had
more
influence
than
caiaphas
the
principle
of
interfering
as
little
as
possible
with
the
religious
liberty
of
the
jews
was
rudely
assailed
by
the
emperor
caius
who
like
a
second
antiochus
after
various
minor
vexations
gave
orders
that
his
image
should
be
set
up
in
the
temple
of
jerusalem
as
in
others
elsewhere
it
was
entirely
through
the
courage
and
tact
of
the
syrian
governor
petronius
that
the
execution
of
these
orders
was
temporarily
postponed
until
the
emperor
was
induced
by
agrippa
to
withdraw
them
caius
soon
afterwards
died
and
under
the
rule
of
agrippa
to
whom
the
government
of
the
entire
kingdom
of
his
grandfather
was
committed
by
claudius
the
jews
enjoyed
much
prosperity
in
every
respect
the
king
was
all
they
could
wish
this
very
prosperity
seems
however
to
have
caused
them
fresh
danger
for
it
made
them
feel
the
government
by
procurators
which
was
resumed
after
the
death
of
agrippa
to
be
particularly
hard
to
bear
whatever
the
individual
characters
of
these
might
be
they
were
cuspius
fadus
from
under
whom
theudas
tiberius
alexander
the
romanised
nephew
of
philo
till
cumanus
under
whom
the
volcano
already
began
to
give
dangerous
signs
of
activity
and
felix
felix
who
has
the
honour
to
be
pilloried
in
the
pages
of
tacitus
contrived
to
make
the
dispeace
permanent
the
influence
of
the
two
older
parties
both
of
which
were
equally
interested
in
the
maintenance
of
the
existing
order
and
in
that
interest
were
being
drawn
nearer
to
each
other
diminished
day
by
day
the
masses
broke
loose
completely
from
the
authority
of
the
scribes
the
ruling
nobility
adapted
itself
better
to
the
times
under
the
circumstances
which
then
prevailed
it
is
not
surprising
that
they
became
thoroughly
secular
and
did
not
shrink
from
the
employment
of
directly
immoral
means
for
the
attainment
of
their
ends
the
zealots
became
the
dominant
party
it
was
a
combination
of
noble
and
base
elements
superstitious
enthusiasts
acts
xxi
and
political
assassins
the
sicarii
were
conjoined
with
honest
but
fanatical
patriots
felix
favoured
the
sicarii
in
order
that
he
might
utilise
them
against
the
others
his
hostility
raged
with
indiscriminating
cruelty
yet
without
being
able
to
check
them
the
anarchy
which
he
left
behind
him
as
a
legacy
was
beyond
the
control
of
his
able
successor
porcius
festus
and
the
last
two
procurators
albinus
and
gessius
florus
acted
as
if
it
had
been
their
special
business
to
encourage
and
promote
it
all
the
bonds
of
social
order
were
dissolved
no
property
was
secure
the
assassins
alone
prospered
and
the
procurators
went
shares
with
them
in
the
profits
it
was
inevitable
that
deep
resentment
against
the
romans
should
be
felt
in
every
honest
heart
at
last
it
found
expression
during
his
visit
to
jerusalem
in
may
florus
laid
hands
upon
the
temple
treasure
the
jews
allowed
themselves
to
go
so
far
as
to
make
a
joke
about
it
which
he
avenged
by
giving
over
a
portion
of
the
city
to
be
plundered
and
crucifying
a
number
of
the
inhabitants
he
next
insisted
upon
their
kissing
the
rod
ordering
that
a
body
of
troops
which
was
approaching
should
be
met
and
welcomed
at
the
persuasion
of
their
leaders
the
jews
forced
themselves
even
to
this
but
a
constant
succession
of
fresh
insults
and
cruelties
followed
till
patience
was
quite
exhausted
at
last
and
in
a
violent
street
fight
the
romans
were
so
handled
that
the
procurator
withdrew
from
the
town
leaving
only
the
cohort
in
antonia
once
again
was
an
attempt
at
pacification
made
by
agrippa
who
hastened
from
alexandria
with
this
purpose
but
the
jews
could
not
bring
themselves
to
make
submission
to
gessius
florus
it
so
happened
that
at
this
juncture
the
fortress
of
masada
on
the
dead
sea
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
zealots
the
courage
of
the
party
of
action
rose
and
at
the
instance
of
the
eleazar
the
son
of
ananias
a
man
still
young
of
highest
priestly
family
the
sacrifice
on
behalf
of
the
emperor
was
discontinued
revolt
was
declared
but
the
native
authorities
continued
opposed
to
a
war
at
their
request
king
agrippa
sent
soldiers
to
jerusalem
at
first
they
appeared
to
have
some
effect
but
ultimately
they
were
glad
to
make
their
escape
in
safety
from
the
city
the
cohort
in
antonia
was
in
like
manner
unable
to
hold
its
own
freedom
was
given
it
to
withdraw
but
contrary
to
the
terms
of
capitulation
it
was
put
to
the
sword
the
war
party
now
signalised
its
triumph
over
all
elements
of
opposition
from
within
by
the
murder
of
the
high
priest
ananias
a
triumph
was
gained
also
over
the
outer
foe
the
syrian
legate
cestius
gallus
appeared
before
jerusalem
in
the
autumn
of
but
after
a
short
period
raised
the
siege
his
deliberate
withdrawal
was
changed
into
a
precipitate
flight
in
an
attack
made
by
the
jews
at
bethhoron
the
revolt
now
spread
irresistibly
through
all
ranks
and
classes
of
the
population
and
the
aristocracy
found
it
expedient
itself
to
assume
the
leadership
an
autonomous
government
was
organised
with
the
noblest
members
of
the
community
at
its
head
of
these
the
most
important
was
the
high
priest
ananus
meanwhile
nero
entrusted
the
conduct
of
the
jewish
war
to
vespasian
his
best
general
in
the
spring
of
he
began
his
task
in
galilee
where
the
historian
josephus
had
command
of
the
insurgents
the
jews
entirely
distrusted
him
and
he
them
in
a
short
time
the
romans
were
masters
of
galilee
only
a
few
strong
places
holding
out
against
them
josephus
was
besieged
in
jotapata
and
taken
prisoner
the
other
places
also
were
unable
to
hold
out
long
such
of
the
champions
of
freedom
in
galilee
as
escaped
betook
themselves
to
jerusalem
amongst
these
was
the
zealot
leader
john
of
giscala
there
they
told
the
story
of
their
misfortunes
of
which
they
laid
the
blame
upon
josephus
and
upon
the
aristocratic
government
as
having
no
heart
for
the
common
cause
and
having
treachery
for
their
motto
the
zealots
now
openly
aimed
at
the
overthrow
of
the
existing
government
but
ananus
bravely
withstood
them
and
pressed
so
hard
on
them
that
they
summoned
the
idumaeans
into
the
city
to
their
aid
these
honourable
fanatics
indeed
withdrew
again
as
soon
as
they
had
discovered
that
they
were
being
used
for
sinister
designs
but
in
the
meanwhile
they
had
accomplished
the
work
of
the
zealots
the
old
magistracy
of
jerusalem
was
destroyed
ananus
with
the
heads
of
the
aristocracy
and
very
many
other
respectable
citizens
put
to
death
the
radicals
for
the
most
part
not
natives
of
the
city
came
into
power
john
of
giscala
at
their
head
tyrannized
over
the
inhabitants
while
these
events
were
taking
place
in
jerusalem
vespasian
had
subdued
the
whole
country
with
the
exception
of
one
or
two
fortresses
but
as
he
was
setting
about
the
siege
of
the
capital
tidings
arrived
of
the
death
of
nero
and
the
offensive
was
discontinued
for
almost
two
years
june
to
april
with
a
short
break
war
was
suspended
when
vespasian
at
the
end
of
this
period
became
emperor
he
entrusted
to
titus
the
task
of
reducing
jerusalem
there
in
the
interval
the
internal
struggle
had
been
going
on
even
after
the
radicals
had
gained
the
mastery
as
a
counterpoise
to
john
of
giscala
the
citizens
had
received
the
guerilla
captain
simon
bar
giora
into
the
city
the
two
were
now
at
feud
with
each
other
but
were
alike
in
their
rapacity
towards
the
citizens
john
occupied
the
temple
simon
the
upper
city
iying
over
against
it
on
the
west
for
a
short
time
a
third
entered
into
competition
with
the
two
rivals
a
certain
eleazar
who
had
separated
from
john
and
established
himself
in
the
inner
temple
but
just
as
titus
was
beginning
the
siege
easter
john
contrived
to
get
rid
of
this
interloper
titus
attacked
from
the
north
after
the
lower
city
had
fallen
into
his
hands
he
raised
banks
with
a
view
to
the
storm
of
the
temple
and
the
upper
city
but
the
defenders
who
were
now
united
in
a
common
cause
taught
him
by
their
vigorous
resistance
that
his
object
was
not
to
be
so
quickly
gained
he
therefore
determined
to
reduce
them
by
famine
and
for
this
end
completely
surrounded
the
city
with
a
strong
wall
in
the
beginning
of
july
he
renewed
the
attack
which
he
directed
in
the
first
instance
against
the

was
completely
stifled
it
did
not
come
wholly
to
an
end
until
the
fall
of
masada
april
the
rabbins
even
now
palestine
continued
for
a
while
to
be
the
centre
of
jewish
life
but
only
in
order
to
prepare
the
way
for
its
transition
into
thoroughly
cosmopolitan
forms
the
development
of
thought
sustained
no
break
on
account
of
the
sad
events
which
had
taken
place
but
was
only
directed
once
more
in
a
consistent
manner
towards
these
objects
which
had
been
set
before
it
from
the
time
of
the
babylonian
exile
on
the
ruins
of
the
city
and
of
the
temple
the
pharisaic
judaism
which
rests
upon
the
law
and
the
school
celebrated
its
triumph
national
fanaticism
indeed
was
not
yet
extinguished
but
it
burnt
itself
completely
out
in
the
vigorous
insurrection
led
by
simeon
bar
koziba
bar
cochebas
that
a
conspicuous
rabbin
akiba
should
have
taken
part
in
it
and
have
recognised
in
simeon
the
messiah
was
an
inconsistency
on
his
part
which
redounds
to
his
honour
inasmuch
as
the
power
of
the
rabbins
did
not
depend
upon
the
political
or
hierarchical
forms
of
the
old
commonwealth
it
survived
the
fall
of
the
latter
out
of
what
hitherto
had
been
a
purely
moral
influence
something
of
an
official
position
now
grew
they
formed
themselves
into
a
college
which
regarded
itself
as
a
continuation
of
the
old
synedrium
and
which
carried
forward
its
name
at
first
its
seat
was
at
jamnia
but
it
soon
removed
to
galilee
and
remained
longest
at
tiberias
the
presidency
was
hereditary
in
the
family
of
hillel
with
the
last
descendants
of
whom
the
court
itself
came
to
an
end

of

simeon
ben
hillel
the
name
gamaliel
was
that
which
occurred
most
frequently
among
the
patriarchs
see
codex
theod
xvi
the
respect
in
which
the
synedrial
president
was
held
rapidly
increased
like
christian
patriarchs
under
mahometan
rule
he
was
also
recognised
by
the
imperial
government
as
the
municipal
head
of
the
jews
of
palestine
and
bore
the
secular
title
of
the
old
high
priests
nasi

under
him
the
palestinian

to
form
a

the
task
of
the
rabbins
was
so
to
reorganise
judaism
under
the
new
circumstances
that
it
could
continue
to
assert
its
distinctive
character
what
of
external
consistency
had
been
lost
through
the
extinction
of
the
ancient
commonwealth
required
to
be
compensated
for
by
an
inner
centralisation
proportionately
stronger
the
separation
from
everything
heathenish
became
more
pronounced
than
before
the
use
of
the
greek
language
was
of
necessity
still
permitted
but
at
least
the
septuagint
was
set
aside
by
aquila
cod
inasmuch
as
it
had
now
become
the
christian
bible
for
to
this
period
also
belongs
the
definitive
separation
between
the
synagogue
and
the
church
henceforward
christianity
could
no
longer
figure
as
a
jewish
sect
intensified
exclusiveness
was
accompanied
by
increased
internal
stringency
what
at
an
earlier
period
had
still
remained
to
some
extent
fluid
now
became
rigidly
fixed
for
example
an
authentic
text
of
the
canon
was
now
established
and
at
the
same
time
the
distinction
between
canon
and
apocrypha
sharply
drawn
the
old
tendency
of
the
scribes
to
leave
as
little
as
possible
free
to
the
individual
conscience
but
to
bring
everything
within
the
scope
of
positive
ordinance
now
celebrated
its
greatest
triumphs
it
was
only
an
apparent
movement
in
the
direction
of
liberty
if
regulations
which
had
become
quite
impossible
were
now
modified
or
cancelled
the
most
influential
of
the
rabbins
were
indeed
the
least
solicitous
about
the
maintenance
of
what
was
old
and
had
no
hesitation
in
introducing
numerous
and
thoroughgoing
innovations
but
the
conservatives
eliezer
ben
hyrcanus
and
ishmael
ben
elisha
were
in
truth
more
than
the
leaders
of
the
party
of
progress
notably
than
akiba
even
the
ultramontanes
have
never
hesitated
at
departures
from
the
usage
of
the
ancient
and
mediaeval
church
and
the
pharisaic
rabbins
were
guided
in
their
innovations
by
liberal
principles
no
more
than
they
the
object
of
the
new
determinations
was
simply
to
widen
the
domain
of
the
law
in
a
consistent
manner
to
bring
the
individual
entirely
under
the
iron
rule
of
system
but
the
jewish
communities
gave
willing
obedience
to
the
hierarchy
of
the
rabbins
judaism
had
to
be
maintained
cost
what
it
might
that
the
means
employed
were
well
adapted
to
the
purpose
of
maintaining
the
jews
as
a
firmly
compacted
religious
community
even
after
all
bonds
of
nationality
had
fallen
away
can
not
be
doubted
but
whether
the
attainment
of
this
purpose
by
incredible
exertion
was
a
real
blessing
to
themselves
and
the
world
may
very
well
be
disputed
one
consequence
of
the
process
of
intellectual
isolation
and
of
the
effort
to
shape
everything
in
accordance
with
hard
and
fast
rules
and
doctrines
was
the
systematisation
and
codification
of
juristic
and
ritual
tradition
a
work
with
which
a
beginning
was
made
in
the
century
following
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
towards
the
end
of
the
century
the
pharisaic
doctrine
of
hillel
as
it
had
been
further
matured
by
akiba
was
codified
and
elevated
to
the
position
of
statute
law
by
the
patriarch
rabban
judah
the
holy
mishna
the
mishna
succeeded
almost
but
not
quite
in
completely
doing
away
with
all
conflicting
tendencies
at
first
the
heterodox
tradition
of
that
time
was
also
committed
to
writing
ishmael
ben
elisha
and
so
handed
down
in
various
forms
col
ection
of
the
baraithas
that
is
of
old
precepts
which
had
not
been
received
into
the
mishna
in
the
tosephtha
nor
did
the
active
opposition
altogether
die
out
even
at
a
later
period
under
favouring
circumstances
it
awoke
to
new
life
in
karaism
the
founder
of
which
anan
ben
david
lived
in
babylonia
in
the
middle
of
the
century
but
this
was
only
the
first
stage
in
the
process
of
systematising
and
fixing
tradition
the
mishna
became
itself
the
object
of
rabbinical
comment
and
supplement
the
tannaim
whose
work
was
registered
in
the
mathnetha
mishna
deuterwsis
doctrine
were
followed
by
the
amoraim
whose
work
in
turn
took
permanent
shape
in
the
gemara
doctrine
the
palestinian
gemara
was
reduced
to
writing
in
perhaps
the
or
century
unfortunately
it
has
been
preserved
to
us
only
in
part
but
appears
to
have
reached
the
middle
ages
in
a
perfect
state
compare
in
the
academy
even
thus
the
process
which
issued
in
the
production
of
the
talmud
was
not
yet
completed
the
babylonian
amoraim
carried
it
forward
for
some
time
longer
until
at
last
at
the
rise
of
islam
the
babylonian
gemara
was
also
written
down
in
the
sth
century
palestine
ceased
to
be
the
centre
of
judaism
several
circumstances
conspired
to
bring
this
about
the
position
of
the
jews
in
the
roman
empire
had
changed
for
the
worse
with
the
elevation
of
christianity
to
be
the
religion
of
the
state
the
large
autonomy
which
until
then
they
had
enjoyed
in
palestine
was
now
restricted
above
all
the
family
of
the
patriarchs
which
had
come
to
form
a
veritable
dynasty
became
extinct
compare
gothofredus
on
cod
xvi
ad
voc
post
excessum
patriarcharum
but
this
did
not
make
an
end
of
what
may
be
called
the
jewish
henceforward
it
had
its
home
in
babylonia
from
the
period
of
the
exile
a
numerous
and
coherent
body
of
jews
had
continued
to
subsist
there
the
parthians
and
sassanidae
granted
them
at
their
head
was
a
native
prince
resh
galutha
can
be
clearly
traced
from
century
onwards
who
when
the
palestinian
patriarchate
came
to
an
end
was
left
without
a
rival
this
remarkable
relic
of
a
jewish
commonwealth
continued
to
exist
until
the
time
of
the
abassides

even
as
early
as
the
beginning
of
the
century
certain
rabbins
at
their
head
abba
areka
rab
had
migrated
from
palestine
and
founded
a
settlement
for
learning
in
the
law
in
babylonia
the
schools
there
at
pumbeditha
sora
nahardea
prospered
greatly
vied
with
those
of
palestine
and
continued
to
exist
after
the
cessation
of
the
latter
when
the
patriarchate
became
extinct
thus
they
had
the
last
word
in
the
settlement
of
doctrine
alongside
of
the
settlement
of
tradition
went
another
task
that
of
fixing
the
letters
of
the
consonantal
text
of
the
bible
by
the
massora
its
vowel
pronunciation
by
the
punctuation
and
its
translation
into
the
aramaic
vernacular
targum
here
also
the
babylonians
came
after
the
palestinians
yet
of
this
sort
of
erudition
palestine
continued
to
be
the
headquarters
even
after
the
century
with
this
task
that
of
attaining
to
the
greatest
possible
conformity
to
the
letter
and
of
continuing
therein
the
inner
development
of
jewish
thought
came
to
an
end
compare

the
later
hebrew
literature
which
does
not
fall
to
be
considered
here
contributed
very
few
new
elements
in
so
far
as
an
intellectual
life
existed
at
all
among
the
jews
of
the
middle
ages
it
was
not
a
growth
of
native
soil
but
proceeded
from
the
mahometan
or
latin
culture
of
individuals
the
kabbala
at
most
and
even
it
hardly
with
justice
can
be
regarded
as
having
been
a
genuine
product
of
judaism
it
originated
in
palestine
and
subsequently
flourished
chiefly
in
the
later
middle
ages
in
spain
and
like
all
other
methodised
nonsense
had
strong
attractions
for
christian
scholars
the
jewish
dispersion
something
still
remains
to
be
said
with
reference
to
the
diaspora
we
have
seen
how
it
began
in

of

xi
it
is
to
be
carried
back
not
to

merely
to
the
babylonian

was
not
composed
of
israelites
but
solely
of
citizens
of
the
southern

it
received
its
greatest
impulse
from
alexander

then
afterwards
from

how

already

how
closely
at

the
jews
even
then
kept
together
as
is
shown
by
the
remark
of
an
author
of
this
period
that
it
was
dangerous
for
a
governor
to
offend
the
jews
in

he
might
then
certainly
reckon
on
being
hissed

capital

at
this
time

business
of

period

we
encounter
the
peculiar
antipathy
of
the
occidentals
touards
this
so
thoroughly
oriental
race
and
their
foreign
opinions
and
customs
this
judaism
although
not
the
most
pleasing
feature
in
the
nowhere
pleasing
picture
of
the
mixture
of
nations
which
then
prevailed
was
nevertheless
an
historical
element
developing
itself
in
the
natural
course
of
things
which
caesar
just
like
his
predecessor
alexander
fostered
as
far
as
possible
did
not
of
course
contemplate
placing
the
jewish
nationality
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
hellenic
or
but
the
jew
who
has
not
like
the
occidental
received
the
pandora
gift
of
political
organisation
and
stands
substantially
in
a
relation
of
indifference
to
the
state
who
moreover
is
as
reluctant
to
give
up
the
essence
of
his
national
idiosyncrasy
as
he

ready
to
clothe
it
with
any
nationality
at
pleasure
and
to
adapt
himself
up
to
a
certain
degree
to
foreign
habits
the
jew
was
for
this
very
reason
as
it
were
made
for
a
state
which
was
to
be
built
on
the
ruins
of
a
hundred
living
polities
and
to
be
endowed
with
a
somewhat
abstract
and
from
the
outset
weakened
nationality
in
the
ancient
world
also
judaism
was
an
effective
leaven
of
cosmopolitanism
and
of
national
decomposition
the
position
of
the
jews
in
the
roman
empire
was
naturally
not
improved
by
the
great
risings
under

trajan
in
cyrene
cyprus
mesopotamia
and
hadrian
the
east
strictly
so
called
became
more
and
more
their
proper
home
the
christianization
of
the
empire
helped
still
further
in
a
very
special
way
to
detach
them
from
the
western
world
for
a
brief
time
only
were
they
again
favoured
by
julian
the
apostate
compare

they
sided
with

against
the

in

they
were
even
put
in

of

by

but
were
not
long
able
to
hold
their
own
against
heraclius
gibbon

with

also
they
found
themselves
in
greater
sympathy
than
with
christianity
although
they
were
cruelly
treated
by
mahomet
in
arabia
and
driven
by
omar
out
of
the
hejaz
and
notwithstanding
the
facts
that
they
were
as
matter
of
course
excluded
from
citizenship
and
that
they
were
held
by
moslems
as
a
whole
in
greater
contempt
than
the
christians
they
throve
especially
well
on
what
may
be
called
the
bridge
between
east
and
west
in
mauretania
and
spain
where
they
were
the
intellectual
intermediaries
between
the
arab
and
the
latin
culture
in
the
sephardim
and
ashkenazim
the
distinction
between
the
subtler
oriental
and
the
more
conservative
western

has
maintained
itself
in

from
the
century
onwards
judaism
put
forth
a
remarkable
side

is
to

believed
but
little
was
required
at
one
time
to
have
induced
the
russians
to
accept
the
jewish
rather
than
the
christian
faith
in
the
west
the
equal
civil
rights
which
caracalla
had
conferred
on
all
free
inhabitants
of
the
empire
came
to
an
end
so
far
as
the
jews
were
concerned
in
the
time
of
constantine
the
state
then
became
the
secular
arm
of
the
church
and
took
action
though
with
less
severity
against
jews
just
as
against
heretics
and
pagans
as
early
as
the
year
constantine
made
conversion
from
christianity
to
judaism
a
penal
offence
and
prohibited
jews
on
pain
of
death
from
circumcising
their
christian
slaves
these
laws
were
and
made
more
severe
by
constantius
who
attached
the
penalty
of
death
to
marriages
between
jews
and
christians
theodosius
and
honorius
indeed
by
strictly
prohibiting
the
destruction
of
synagogues
and
by
maintaining
the
old
regulation
that
a
jew
was
not
to
be
summoned
before
a
court
of
justice
on
a
put
a
check
upon
the
militant
zeal
of
the
church
by
which
even
chrysostom
for
example
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
away
at
antioch
but
honorius
rendered
them
ineligible
for
civil
or
military
service
leaving
open
to
them
only
the
bar
and
the
decurionate
the
latter
being
a
their
liberty
to
try
cases
by
their
own
law
was
curtailed
the
cases
between
jews
and
christians
were
to
be
tried
by
christian
judges
only
theodosius
ii
prohibited
them
from
building
new
synagogues
and
anew
enforced
their
disability
for
all
state
employments
most
hostile
of
all
was
the
orthodox
justinian

however
was
still
more
severe

the

did
not
fare
badly
on
the
whole
it
was
only
in
cases
where
the
state
was
dominated
by
the
catholic
church
as
for
example
among
the
spanish
visigoths
that
they
were
cruelly
oppressed
among
the
arian
ostrogoths
on
the
other
hand
they
had
nothing
to
complain
of
one
thing
in
their
favour
was
the
germanic
principle
that
the
law
to
be
applied
depended
not
on
the
land
but
on
the
nationality
as
now
in
the
east
europeans
are
judged
by

according
to

of
their
respective

the

of
the

communities
which
had
been
curtailed
by
the
later
emperors
was
now
enlarged
once
more
under
the
laxer
political
and
legal
conditions
the
jews
fared
remarkably

frankish

the

them
in

possible
way

showed
no

for
it
leaving

they
devoted
them
selves
to

the

was
completely
in

a

their

they
were

to

a

indeed

at
the

time
made
themselves
still
more
repugnant
to
the

population
than
they
previously
were
by
reason
of
their
religion
having
according
to
the
later
mediaeval
system
no
rights
in
the
christian
state
the
jews
were
tolerated
only
in
those
territories
where
the
sovereign
in
the
exercise
of
free
favour
accorded
them
protection
this
protection
was

them
in

quarters

had
indeed
the
right
of
extirpating
them
altogether
with
the
exception
of
a
small
number
to
be
left
as
a
memorial
but
in
the
first
place
he
had
in
various
ways
given
up
this
right
to
the

of

his
pecuniary
resources
were
so
small
that

could
not

in

parts

the
political
confusion
was
greatest
they
even
succeeded
in
maintaining
a
kind

by

of
an
arrangement
in
virtue
of
which
civil
processes
which
they
had
against

having
on
the
one
hand
separated

and
on
the
other
hand
been
excluded
on
religious
grounds
from
the
gentiles
gained
an
internal
solidarity
and
solidity
which
has
hitherto
enabled
them
to
survive
all
the
attacks
of
time
the
hostility
of
the
middle
ages
involved
them
in
no
danger
the
greatest
peril
has
been
brought
upon
them
by
modern
times
along
with
permission
and
increasing
inducements
to
abandon
their
separate
position
it
is
worth
while
to
recall
on
this
point
the
opinion
of
spinoza
who
was
well
able
to
form
a
competent
judgment
tract
theol
ad
fin
that
the
jews
have
maintained
themselves
so
long
in
spite
of
their
dispersed
and
disorganised
condition
is
not
at
all
to
be
wondered
at
when
it
is
considered
how
they
separated
themselves
from
all
other
nationalities
in
such
a
way
as
to
bring
upon
themselves
the
hatred
of
all
and
that
not
only
by
external
rites
contrary
to
those
of
other
nations
but
also
by
the
sign
of
circumcision
which
they
maintain
most
religiously
experience
shows
that
their
conservation
is
due
in
a
great
degree
to
the
very
hatred
which
they
have
incurred
when
the
king
of
spain
compelled
the
jews
either
to
accept
the
national
religion
or
to
go
into
banishment
very
many
of
them
accepted
the
roman
catholic
faith
and
in
virtue
of
this
received
all
the
privileges
of
spanish
subjects
and
were
declared
eligible
for
every
honour
the
consequence
was
that
a
process
of
absorption
began
immediately
and
in
a
short
time
neither
trace
nor
memory
of
them
survived
quite
different
was
the
history
of
those
whom
the
king
of
portugal
compelled
to
accept
the
creed
of
his
nation
although
converted
they
continued
to
live
apart
from
the
rest
of
their
having
been
declared
unfit
for
any
dignity
so
great
importance
do
i
attach
to
the
sign
of
circumcision
also
in
this
connection
that
i
am
persuaded
that
it
is
sufficient
by
itself
to
maintain
the
separate
existence
of
the
nation
for
ever
the
persistency
of
the
race
may
of
course
prove
a
harder
thing
to
overcome
than
spinoza
has
supposed
but
nevertheless
he
will
be
found
to
have
spoken
truly
in
declaring
that
the
emancipation
of
the
jews
must
inevitably
lead
to
the
extinction
of
judaism
wherever
the
process
is
extended
beyond
the
political
to
the
social
sphere
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
centuries
may
be
required
