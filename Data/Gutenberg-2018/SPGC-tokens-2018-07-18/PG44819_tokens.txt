a

on

amelia
purdy
incredible
you
say
alas
it
was
too
true
she
was
dead
by
her
own
hand
the
beautiful
of
vincent
carew
the
millionaire
dead
in
her
youth
and
beauty
leaving
behind
her
all
that
life
held
for
a
worshipped
wife
and
loving
mother
for
upstairs
at
this
moment
in
the
silken
nursery
her
child
the
baby
kathleen
barely
six
months
old
lay
sweetly
sleeping
watched
by
an
attentive
french
while
in
the
darkened
parlor
below
the
girlish
mother
not
yet
eighteen
lay
pale
and
beautiful
in
her
coffin
with
white
flowers
blooming
on
the
pulseless
breast
hiding
the
crimson
stain
where
the
slight
jeweled
dagger
from
her
hair
had
sheathed
itself
in
her
tortured
heart
she
was
so
young
so
ignorant
or
surely
she
would
have
held
back
her
suicidal
hand
she
would
have
taken
pity
on
her
child
the
little
heiress
she
was
leaving
motherless
in
the
wide
wide
world
that
whatever
else
it
may
give
us
can
not
make
up
for
the
loss
of
the
best
thing
life
has
to
offer
a
mother
love
it
is
always
a
terrible
misfortune
to
a
young
girl
to
be
motherless
and
it
was
going
to
be
the
tragedy
of
kathleen
carew
life
that
she
had
no
mother
the
that
let
out
the
of
unhappy
zaidee
carew
turned
the
whole
course
of
her
daughter
life
aside
into
different
channels
but
that
lay
in
the
future
all
boston
wondered
over
the
tragic
death
of
vincent
carew
wife
and
people
asked
each
other
in
dismay
why
did
she
do
it
no
one
could
answer
that
question
the
world
thought
that
the
young
wife
was
perfectly
happy
and
why
not
surely
she
had
good
cause
vincent
carew
the
rich
bachelor
who
was
a
power
in
politics
and
aspired
to
be
governor
of
his
state
had
married
zaidee
franklyn
out
of
a
home
lifting
her
at
a
bound
to
rank
and
fortune
and
all
for
love
of
her
fair
face
he
had
snapped
his
white
fingers
in
the
face
of
the
world
that
called
his
marriage
a
and
carried
everything
by
storm
for
his
sake
society
cultured
boston
society
had
received
his
wife
the
lovely
young
southern
girl
with
her
shy
ways
and
neglected
education
and
for
a
time
all
went
well
so
no
one
could
answer
the
question
why
did
she
kill
herself
but
that
was
because
vincent
carew
was
too
proud
to
admit
the
ubiquitous
reporter
inside
his
aristocratic
portals
if
one
of
these
curious
mortals
had
secured
admittance
to
the
house
and
questioned
the
servants
they
would
have
told
him
what
they
suspected
and
discussed
in
whispers
among
themselves
that
madame
was
madly
jealous
of
the
teacher
her
husband
had
employed
to
finish
her
very
imperfect
education
she
is
a
snake
in
the
grass
that
pretty
widow
and
she
makes
my
mistress
unhappy
said
the
housekeeper
the
first
month
that
belmont
came
and
her
opinion
was
adopted
by
all
the
other
servants
they
all
hated
the
stately
young
widow
in
her
black
garments
and
when
the
grewsome
tragedy
of
carew
death
darkened
the
sunlight
in
that
luxurious
home
they
whispered
to
each
other
that
it
was
belmont
who
had
worked
their
mistress
such
bitter
woe
that
she
could
not
bear
her
life
if
indeed
she
had
schemed
for
anything
like
this
belmont
had
succeeded
in
her
designs
zaidee
carew
with
her
own
dimpled
white
hand
had
cut
the
gordian
knot
of
life
and
in
a
few
more
days
a
stately
funeral
moved
away
from
vincent
carew
doors
to
the
cemetery
where
his
dead
wife
in
all
her
youthful
beauty
was
laid
to
rest
beneath
the
grass
and
flowers
chapter
ii
after
sixteen
years
an
exquisite
face
patrician
in
style
note
the
lashes
how
black
and
their
sweep
the
arch
of
the
brows
and
the
proud
lip
smile
the
flash
of
the
eyes
dark
and
deep
away
from
the
forehead
in
waves
the
hair
flows
with
the
glisten
of
bronze
glorious
in
volume
the
frame
from
where
the
face
of
an
houri
dawns
amelia
purdy
i
never
saw
such
a
forgetful
girl
as
you
kathleen
carew
here
you
sit
dreaming
instead
of
dressing
for
karl
are
you
going
to
the
theater
then
or
not
of
course
i
am
going
alpine
i
did
not
know
it
was
so
late
what
you
are
dressed
already
how
sweet
you
look
that
blue
crêpe
de
chine
is
awfully
becoming
to
you
well
then
please
ring
the
bell
for
my
maid
wo
you
i
be
ready
in
ten
minutes
you
better
mamma
will
be
furious
if
you
keep
her
waiting
alpine
belmont
answered
crossly
as
she
touched
the
bell
then
she
looked
back
curiously
at
the
graceful
indolent
figure
in
the
leaning
back
with
white
hands
clasped
on
top
of
the
head
kathleen
what
were
you
thinking
about
so
intently
when
i
came
in
i
had
to
speak
twice
before
you
heard
me
kathleen
raised
her
dark
passionate
oriental
eyes
to
the
face
and
blushing
vivid
crimson
answered
dreamily
alpine
i
was
thinking
of
that
handsome
young
man
who
saved
my
life
at
newport
last
summer
i
was
wondering
who
he
was
and
if
we
should
ever
see
him
again
it
is
likely
we
ever
will
answered
alpine
belmont
carelessly
i
do
suppose
he
in
our
set
at
all
some
poor
clerk
spending
all
his
winter
savings
on
a
short
summer
outing
very
likely
i
be
thinking
about
him
like
a
romantic
if
i
were
you
kathleen
he
did
care
about
you
or
he
would
have
made
himself
known
to
you
before
this
and
with
a
low
taunting
laugh
alpine
belmont
left
the
room
just
as
susette
the
maid
came
in
you
have
to
do
my
hair
in
a
hurry
susie
there
no
time
for
prinking
laughed
her
mistress
and
while
the
maid
brushed
out
the
magnificent
rippling
tresses
kathleen
relapsed
into
thoughts
of
the
unknown
hero
whose
handsome
image
haunted
her
thoughts
is
it
true
as
alpine
says
that
he
did
not
care
for
me
it
is
strange
he
did
not
stay
to
inquire
who
i
was
after
i
came
so
near
drowning
if
he
was
a
poor
young
clerk
as
alpine
believes
perhaps
he
was
too
proud
to
reveal
himself
thinking
i
would
scorn
him
because
i
was
an
heiress
ah
how
little
he
knew
kathleen
carew
heart
her
thoughts
ran
thrillingly
on
oh
how
handsome
he
was
when
i
first
saw
him
in
the
water
that
day
at
newport
he
kept
watching
me
and
i
could
not
help
looking
back
he
seemed
to
draw
my
eyes
i
know
i
wanted
him
to
like
me
for
i
wondered
if
my
bathing
suit
was
becoming
and
i
felt
glad
my
hair
was
down
because
i
had
been
told
it
looked
pretty
that
way
all
wet
and
curling
over
my
shoulders
his
brown
eyes
said
as
plain
as
words
that
he
admired
me
other
men
did
too
i
know
but
this
time
it
seemed
to
thrill
me
with
a
new
pleasure
as
i
splashed
about
like
a
mermaid
in
the
waves
i
kept
thinking
of
him
wondering
who
he
was
and
hoping
he
would
be
at
the
ball
that
night
i
wanted
him
to
see
how
well
i
looked
in
my
white
lace
and
pearls
then
all
at
once
came
that
treacherous
undertow
that
swept
me
from
my
feet
down
down
down
under
the
heavy
waves
oh
how
horrible
it
was
i
thought
i
would
be
drowned
and
my
last
thought
was
what
gown
miss
kathleen
asked
the
maid
anything
susette
it
do
matter
how
i
look
you
decide
oh
well
that
new
white
cloth
with
the
pink
ostrich
feather
trimming
and
diamonds
alpine
is
wearing
pearls
and
a
blue
gown
and
we
do
want
to
be
dressed
alike
while
susette
fastened
the
exquisite
gown
and
clasped
the
diamonds
her
thoughts
ran
on
he
rescued
me
the
handsome
brave
fellow
and
as
soon
as
he
laid
me
limp
but
faintly
conscious
upon
the
sands
he
walked
hastily
away
and
no
one
at
newport
ever
saw
him
again
neither
could
any
one
ever
find
out
who
he
was
although
i
afraid
mamma
did
not
try
very
hard
but
he
was
certainly
very
modest
he
did
not
want
us
to
make
a
hero
of
him
heigho
i
do
wish
i
knew
his
name
i
do
wish
i
could
see
him
again
alpine
says
i
am
foolish
and
romantic
and
that
i
fell
in
love
with
him
because
he
saved
my
life
indeed
i
think
it
was
before
yes
at
the
very
moment
i
first
met
his
beautiful
brown
eyes
gazing
so
eagerly
into
mine
a
quick
electric
thrill
seemed
to
dart
through
me
and
kathleen
are
you
ready
yet
asked
alpine
entering
the
carriage
has
been
waiting
ever
so
long
and
mamma
is
getting
furious
over
your
delay
i
ready
kathleen
answered
composedly
without
hurrying
the
least
bit
she
drew
her
white
leisurely
about
her
shoulders
and
followed
her
to
where
vincent
carew
second
wife
once
the
widow
belmont
poor
zaidee
governess
was
waiting
in
impotent
wrath
at
the
detention
the
first
act
will
be
quite
over
before
we
get
there
and
it
will
be
entirely
your
fault
for
alpine
and
i
have
been
ready
for
an
hour
she
fretted
as
they
entered
the
carriage
chapter
iii
this
prince
karl
this
ralph
chainey
is
my
rescuer
at
newport
last
summer
whispered
the
romantic
girl
this
is
the
way
of
it
wide
world
over
one
is
beloved
and
one
is
the
lover
one
gives
and
the
other
receives
the
first
act
had
indeed
begun
when
carew
with
her
two
daughters
entered
their
box
at
the
theater
but
absorbing
as
was
the
interest
in
the
popular
play
prince
karl
many
heads
were
turned
to
gaze
admiringly
at
the
trio
of
fair
ones
for
the
matron
although
fifty
years
old
looked
much
younger
and
her
stately
charms
were
set
off
to
advantage
by
black
velvet
and
jet
with
ruby
ornaments
on
her
neck
and
arms
her
hair
was
arranged
very
becomingly
and
alpine
felt
quite
proud
of
her
mother
appearance
alpine
belmont
herself
was
a
blonde
a
trifle
below
the
medium
height
and
with
a
rather
too
decided
inclination
to
but
the
plumpness
and
dimples
were
rather
fascinating
now
in
the
heyday
of
youth
she
was
barely
twenty
and
with
passable
features
pale
hair
and
blue
eyes
alpine
passed
as
a
belle
and
beauty
but
kathleen
carew
kathleen
with
her
slender
perfect
figure
just
above
medium
height
and
her
vivid
face
as
fresh
as
a
flower
with
her
great
starry
passionate
oriental
eyes
veiled
by
thick
curling
lashes
black
as
starless
midnight
in
such
strong
contrast
to
the
rich
of
the
rippling
hair
that
crowned
her
queenly
little
head
kathleen
carew
was
truly
the
rose
that
all
were
praising
the
house
is
crowded
carew
observed
in
a
gratified
tone
as
she
swept
the
brilliant
with
her
lorgnette
oh
of
course
they
say
ralph
chainey
is
a
splendid
actor
returned
alpine
as
she
threw
back
her
cloak
to
give
the
crowd
the
benefit
of
her
plump
white
arms
and
shoulders
does
ralph
chainey
play
prince
karl
inquired
kathleen
with
languid
interest
and
forgetting
to
listen
for
the
answer
turned
her
attention
to
the
stage
where
the
actors
were
strutting
their
brief
day
the
play
went
on
and
kathleen
rousing
with
a
start
out
of
her
languid
mood
watched
it
with
eager
eyes
everybody
knows
the
clever
fascinating
play
prince
karl
mansfield
has
made
it
immortal
in
his
rôle
of
the
courier
this
new
actor
whose
name
had
brought
out
the
fashionable
world
of
cultured
boston
was
no
whit
behind
mansfield
in
his
clever
impersonations
he
was
young
and
had
flashed
upon
the
dramatic
world
two
years
before
with
the
brightness
of
a
star
time
was
adding
fresh
laurels
to
his
name
and
boston
critical
as
it
was
did
not
hesitate
to
add
its
plaudits
for
be
it
known
ralph
washburn
chainey
was
a
bostonian
to
the
manor
born
oh
it
is
splendid
and
is
he
not
perfectly
magnificent
exclaimed
alpine
belmont
turning
eagerly
to
kathleen
as
the
curtain
fell
upon
the
first
act
then
she
started
with
surprise
for
kathleen
was
leaning
back
in
her
chair
breathing
heavily
her
face
very
pale
her
eyes
half
veiled
by
the
drooping
lids
kathleen
what
is
the
matter
are
you
going
to
sleep
or
are
you
ill
or
she
demanded
in
a
high
whisper
kathleen
caught
alpine
hand
and
drew
it
against
her
side
oh
alpine
feel
my
heart
how
it
beats
she
whispered
i
have
had
such
a
shock
did
you
not
recognize
him
too
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
kathleen
do
you
oh
alpine
i
have
found
out
at
last
my
hero
whispered
the
romantic
girl
kathleen
you
dreaming
i
not
i
knew
him
in
a
minute
and
he
recognized
me
too
i
saw
it
in
his
glance
when
his
eyes
met
mine
he
started
then
i
smiled
i
could
not
help
it
i
was
so
glad
carew
had
been
listening
to
catch
the
whispered
conversation
a
heavy
frown
darkened
her
face
she
leaned
forward
and
muttered
harshly
kathleen
you
must
be
crazy
the
girl
shrugged
her
shoulders
contemptuously
and
took
no
other
notice
of
the
speech
but
alpine
curiosity
was
awakened
and
she
whispered
eagerly
where
is
he
then
point
him
out
to
me
i
can
not
he
has
gone
off
wait
till
he
returns
answered
kathleen
sitting
up
straight
in
her
chair
again
the
color
was
coming
back
into
her
face
again
her
eyes
flashed
radiantly
carew
regarded
her
with
suppressed
displeasure
some
gentlemen
acquaintances
came
into
the
box
and
the
subject
of
kathleen
discovery
was
dropped
they
chatted
gayly
until
the
time
for
the
curtain
to
rise
then
returned
to
their
seats
the
curtain
rose
upon
the
second
act
of
the
play
and
alpine
was
so
interested
that
she
leaned
eagerly
forward
quite
forgetting
in
her
keen
admiration
of
prince
karl
her
interesting
disclosure
just
now
but
suddenly
kathleen
taper
fingers
closed
in
a
gentle
pinch
upon
her
plump
arm
look
now
do
you
recognize
him
she
murmured
triumphantly
who
where
oh
for
goodness
sake
kathleen
do
bother
me
now
i
do
want
to
lose
a
word
of
glorious
prince
karl
but
alpine
it
is
prince
karl
my
hero
good
heavens
kathleen
do
you
really
mean
it
yes
i
do
alpine
this
prince
karl
this
ralph
chainey
is
my
rescuer
at
newport
last
summer
watch
him
alpine
and
perhaps
you
will
catch
him
looking
at
us
a
little
consciously
as
i
did
just
now
i
see
the
likeness
answered
alpine
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
dismay
whose
import
kathleen
could
not
understand
she
said
no
more
to
her
but
sat
through
the
remainder
of
the
play
in
a
blissful
dream
the
beautiful
young
heiress
was
intensely
romantic
and
for
long
months
her
fancy
had
been
haunted
by
the
image
of
the
handsome
young
man
who
had
saved
her
life
to
find
him
again
in
the
handsome
young
actor
whose
name
was
on
every
lip
thrilled
her
with
delight
he
had
recognized
her
too
and
the
memory
of
his
startled
glance
so
quickly
withdrawn
thrilled
her
with
keen
delight
although
he
did
not
permit
her
to
meet
his
eyes
again
kathleen
felt
a
little
triumph
too
over
alpine
who
had
declared
that
her
hero
was
doubtless
a
mere
nobody
perhaps
a
clerk
in
a
country
store
than
which
position
alpine
contemptuous
ideas
could
not
descend
lower
alpine
was
watching
him
now
with
such
eager
interest
that
kathleen
smiled
and
thought
i
believe
alpine
has
fallen
in
love
with
him
herself
but
she
need
not
he
is
mine
mine
mine
she
was
claiming
him
already
in
her
thoughts
forgetting
that
she
had
never
even
spoken
to
the
handsome
stranger
to
whom
she
owed
such
a
debt
of
gratitude
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
as
dear
to
him
as
he
was
to
her
and
she
almost
expected
to
see
him
waiting
to
hand
her
to
her
carriage
when
they
left
the
theater
but
no
the
faint
fluttering
hope
was
soon
extinguished
other
admirers
were
waiting
obsequiously
eager
for
the
honor
of
touching
the
small
gloved
hand
of
the
beautiful
belle
but
when
the
curtain
dropped
on
prince
karl
bowing
to
the
applauding
audience
kathleen
saw
him
no
more
that
night
when
carew
dismissed
her
maid
that
night
she
sent
an
imperative
summons
to
her
to
come
to
her
room
and
received
in
return
a
polite
request
to
be
excused
kathleen
was
tired
and
meant
to
retire
immediately
chapter
iv
i
distinctly
forbid
you
to
know
this
actor
said
carew
love
is
a
pearl
of
purest
hue
but
stormy
waves
are
round
it
and
dearly
may
a
woman
rue
the
hour
when
first
she
found
it
despite
the
message
carew
who
went
at
once
to
kathleen
room
in
a
rage
at
her
impertinence
found
the
young
girl
still
in
her
and
jewels
sitting
dreamily
in
an
having
dismissed
susette
to
arrange
her
bath
she
yawned
sleepily
at
her
entrance
i
sent
you
word
to
wait
till
she
said
petulantly
i
did
not
choose
to
wait
miss
impertinence
and
as
kathleen
opened
wide
her
big
black
eyes
in
a
sort
of
contemptuous
amazement
carew
continued
angrily
alpine
has
told
me
how
silly
you
were
over
that
actor
how
you
love
him
and
long
to
get
acquainted
with
him
do
you
not
know
that
it
is
very
bold
and
coarse
for
a
young
girl
to
even
think
of
a
man
that
way
until
he
has
given
some
sign
of
liking
for
her
but
alpine
declares
that
this
man
has
never
even
noticed
you
alpine
is
a
sneaking
and
you
are
a
cruel
woman
kathleen
answered
indignantly
and
madame
if
i
am
ignorant
as
you
charge
of
the
proper
feeling
to
observe
toward
men
who
is
to
blame
for
that
why
did
you
not
train
me
as
carefully
as
you
did
your
daughter
alpine
you
took
my
poor
dead
mother
place
before
i
was
two
years
old
why
did
you
not
do
your
duty
by
her
orphan
child
how
dare
you
speak
to
me
like
this
demanded
the
angry
woman
be
silent
and
listen
to
my
commands
her
fingers
itched
to
slap
the
cheek
that
dimpled
with
insolent
amusement
but
she
clinched
her
hand
and
went
on
your
father
left
you
in
my
care
when
he
went
abroad
for
his
health
and
you
shall
obey
my
commands
while
he
is
gone
if
you
dare
defy
me
i
shall
lock
you
in
your
room
on
bread
and
water
till
you
beg
my
pardon
there
was
no
answer
kathleen
looked
her
indignation
that
was
all
i
distinctly
forbid
said
carew
any
further
nonsense
over
this
actor
good
heavens
an
what
would
your
haughty
father
say
contemptuously
i
will
not
take
you
to
the
theater
again
while
he
plays
here
you
disgraced
yourself
making
eyes
at
him
on
the
stage
and
there
shall
be
no
more
of
it
i
shall
not
permit
him
to
make
your
acquaintance
even
if
he
seeks
to
do
so
which
is
very
doubtful
as
scornfully
the
infatuation
seems
to
be
all
on
one
side
kathleen
writhed
with
mortification
but
she
did
not
permit
her
foe
to
see
how
cruelly
she
was
wounded
she
held
her
queenly
little
head
erect
with
that
silent
smile
of
maddening
amusement
on
her
scarlet
lips
years
of
wrong
and
injustice
had
made
her
scorn
this
woman
who
filled
her
dead
mother
place
so
unworthily
and
she
made
few
efforts
to
conceal
her
feelings
i
forbid
any
acquaintance
with
this
ralph
chainey
this
actor
do
you
understand
me
kathleen
repeated
her
i
have
heard
you
answered
the
young
girl
with
a
mutinous
pout
of
her
full
lip
you
will
obey
me
a
little
anxiously
for
kathleen
had
never
been
so
aggressively
rebellious
as
at
the
question
kathleen
rose
to
her
feet
and
stood
up
like
a
young
lioness
at
bay
i
will
obey
you
madame
she
replied
what
almost
shrieked
carew
i
will
not
obey
you
she
repeated
with
flashing
eyes
i
will
not
run
after
chainey
as
you
pretend
so
falsely
that
i
am
doing
and
i
will
make
no
unmaidenly
overtures
toward
his
acquaintance
but
if
the
proper
opportunity
offers
for
me
to
know
and
thank
him
for
saving
my
life
i
shall
surely
avail
myself
of
it
they
stood
glaring
at
each
other
the
girl
roused
into
furious
rebellion
the
woman
speechless
with
fury
her
eyes
seeming
to
emit
electric
sparks
from
her
deathly
white
face
so
intense
was
her
fierce
wrath
controlling
herself
with
an
effort
she
turned
to
leave
the
room
and
pausing
on
the
threshold
hissed
back
one
significant
sentence
at
the
defiant
girl
forewarned
is
forearmed
i
do
not
fear
you
kathleen
answered
but
carew
never
looked
back
what
will
she
do
what
can
she
do
she
will
never
dare
lock
me
in
my
room
as
she
threatened
kathleen
murmured
uneasily
and
then
her
overstrained
nerves
gave
way
she
threw
herself
on
the
bed
and
sobbed
aloud
in
nervous
abandonment
to
her
outraged
feelings
god
help
that
poor
motherless
girl
she
knew
that
the
events
of
that
night
would
only
make
her
life
harder
than
it
had
been
before
under
the
roof
that
her
ruled
with
an
iron
hand
the
beautiful
young
heiress
did
not
have
a
happy
life
in
spite
of
all
the
good
gifts
with
which
fate
had
so
richly
dowered
her
at
her
birth
her
had
always
hated
her
and
never
relaxed
her
efforts
to
harden
her
father
heart
against
his
only
child
perhaps
she
hated
kathleen
the
more
because
heaven
had
denied
any
children
to
her
second
marriage
and
she
knew
that
to
this
girl
would
go
the
bulk
of
her
father
great
wealth
carew
had
two
children
by
her
first
marriage
a
son
now
called
ivan
and
the
girl
alpine
her
favorite
scheme
was
to
marry
the
hated
kathleen
to
this
son
so
that
he
might
share
her
rich
inheritance
failing
in
this
she
meant
if
it
lay
in
the
power
of
a
human
devil
to
compass
it
to
have
kathleen
disgraced
and
disinherited
so
that
she
and
her
children
might
enjoy
the
whole
of
the
great
carew
fortune
chapter
carew
is
mysteriously
absent
alas
that
clouds
should
ever
steal
love
delicious
sky
that
ever
love
sweet
lip
should
feel
aught
but
the
gentlest
sigh
carew
did
not
appear
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
and
alpine
with
a
reproachful
glance
at
kathleen
said
that
mamma
was
sick
she
had
been
so
worried
last
night
that
she
could
not
sleep
and
this
morning
she
had
such
a
terrible
headache
that
she
must
lie
abed
all
day
kathleen
did
not
look
either
repentant
or
sorry
she
simply
said
that
in
that
case
she
would
not
practice
her
music
this
morning
and
went
off
to
her
own
little
studio
where
she
painted
a
while
with
great
ardor
then
threw
down
her
brush
and
rang
for
susette
to
bring
up
the
morning
papers
susette
lingered
a
minute
after
she
had
put
down
the
newspapers
miss
kathleen
i
do
think
it
will
disturb
carew
the
least
bit
if
you
practice
your
music
she
said
significantly
but
her
head
aches
susette
no
it
do
miss
she
not
in
the
house
so
there
she
went
away
early
very
early
in
her
the
lord
knows
where
for
james
told
me
so
on
the
sly
james
was
the
butler
and
sweetheart
kathleen
looked
a
little
startled
as
she
said
you
must
be
mistaken
ellen
has
been
with
her
mistress
all
day
i
tapped
at
the
door
a
while
ago
to
ask
how
she
was
and
she
reported
carew
as
very
low
they
are
all
deceiving
you
miss
kathleen
but
what
for
i
do
know
only
i
sure
and
certain
she
ai
in
this
house
protested
susette
stoutly
very
well
susette
her
absence
has
no
more
interest
for
me
than
her
presence
kathleen
answered
indifferently
as
she
opened
and
read
the
encomiums
on
ralph
chainey
acting
that
filled
a
critical
half
column
her
eyes
sparkled
and
her
cheeks
glowed
with
pleasure
he
plays
karl
again
oh
if
i
only
could
go
again
she
thought
regretfully
then
throwing
down
the
paper
she
decided
she
would
go
and
practice
her
music
since
carew
was
not
ill
as
alpine
pretended
she
had
played
but
a
few
bars
when
alpine
entered
with
reproachful
eyes
have
you
no
feeling
kathleen
you
will
kill
mamma
since
mamma
went
away
this
morning
early
and
has
not
yet
returned
there
no
danger
kathleen
answered
coolly
it
is
false
who
told
you
so
no
matter
how
i
found
it
out
i
in
possession
of
the
mysterious
fact
it
that
prying
susette
i
know
i
shall
advise
mamma
to
dismiss
her
immediately
you
better
not
alpine
susette
knows
some
of
your
kathleen
answered
with
a
provoking
laugh
i
have
no
secrets
snapped
alpine
but
she
left
the
room
discomfited
kathleen
practiced
and
read
until
the
late
luncheon
where
she
was
surprised
to
find
herself
alone
where
is
miss
belmont
james
she
asked
miss
belmont
went
out
for
a
walk
he
answered
respectfully
while
kathleen
was
making
up
her
mind
to
go
for
a
walk
too
some
callers
were
announced
she
received
the
matron
and
her
two
gay
young
daughters
entertained
them
herself
with
an
apology
for
the
absence
of
the
other
members
of
the
family
and
saw
them
depart
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
will
go
for
my
walk
now
she
decided
but
turning
from
the
piano
she
saw
an
open
note
lying
on
the
floor
her
own
name
attracted
her
and
picking
it
up
she
read
under
date
of
that
morning
dear
alpine
and
kathleen
mamma
wishes
you
to
join
us
at
an
informal
lunch
to
meet

see
our
beautiful
kathleen
the
note
bore
the
name
of
helen
fox
one
of
their
intimate
girl
friends
and
kathleen
realized
in
a
minute
that
she
had
been
tricked
by
crafty
alpine
who
had
gone
to
the
luncheon
alone
to
meet
ralph
chainey
a
futile
sob
of
bitter
disappointment
rose
in
the
girl
throat
and
crushing
the
note
in
her
hand
she
walked
to
the
window
gazing
blankly
out
into
the
handsome
street
through
burning
tears
a
light
laugh
startled
her
there
was
alpine
belmont
in
elegant
attire
walking
toward
the
gate
with
a
tall
handsome
young
man
lifting
his
hat
with
a
smile
he
left
the
young
lady
there
and
walked
away
with
a
hasty
backward
glance
at
the
window
that
showed
him
a
lovely
woful
face
staring
in
undisguised
wonder
at
the
spectacle
of
ralph
chainey
walking
home
with
deceitful
alpine
belmont
alpine
you
wicked
girl
how
could
you
treat
me
so
unfairly
she
demanded
shaking
with
passion

herself
into
a
chair

laughing

night

me

from
helen

last
night
till
i
told
you

the
man
that

you
at
newport
then
i
said
you
would

very
glance
of
her
roguish
blue
eyes
invited
confidence
she
was
the
most
popular
girl
in
her
set
and
the
intimate
friend
of
kathleen
carew
and
alpine
belmont
helen
had
been
sadly
disappointed
because
kathleen
had
not
come
to
the
luncheon
and
the
excuse
that
alpine
offered
namely
that
her
could
not
tear
herself
away
from
a
new
novel
seemed
too
shallow
to
entertain
i
really
mad
with
kathleen
the
lazy
thing
she
said
frankly
to
ralph
chainey
who
smiled
but
made
no
comment
he
was
thinking
about
what
miss
belmont
had
told
him
just
now
it
rankled
in
his
mind
i
am
anxious
for
you
to
meet
her
she
is
such
a
beauty
continued
helen
enthusiastically
he
gave
some
flattering
answer
that
made
her
dimple
and
blush
but
she
answered
with
a
careless
glance
around
oh
yes
we
girls
are
well
enough
but
wait
till
you
see
my
bonny
kathleen
such
lips
such
hair
such
eyes
ralph
chainey
laughed
you
need
be
so
sarcastic
chainey
you
have
seen
our
beauty
yet
i
saw
her
last
night
at
the
theater
oh
so
you
did
i
forgot
that
well
is
she
charming
the
handsome
actor
replied
with
a
quotation
beautiful
faultily
faultless
she
is
all
that
helen
fox
replied
but
she
looked
at
him
with
puzzled
eyes
and
thought
within
herself
that
he
was
somehow
piqued
at
kathleen
carew
but
why
since
the
two
had
never
met
suddenly
the
reason
presented
itself
to
her
mind
the
great
vain
thing
he
is
piqued
because
the
beauty
did
come
to
the
luncheon
he
is
offended
because
she
did
not
seem
anxious
to
meet
him
and
she
was
secretly
amused
at
the
young
actor
palpable
vanity
regarding
it
as
a
good
joke
little
dreaming
of
the
seed
that
alpine
belmont
had
been
sowing
in
his
mind
many
envious
glances
followed
alpine
a
little
later
when
she
bore
ralph
chainey
off
in
triumph
as
her
escort
home
but
helen
was
pleased
for
she
thought
if
alpine
asks
him
into
the
house
he
will
get
acquainted
with
kathleen
and
then
he
will
find
out
how
lovable
she
is
but
when
george
fox
who
had
also
walked
home
with
a
young
lady
on
commonwealth
avenue
returned
home
he
reported
that
ralph
chainey
had
left
miss
belmont
at
the
door
suddenly
helen
remembered
sundry
small
matters
that
were
not
at
all
to
alpine
credit
that
girl
is
tricky
i
know
she
said
to
herself
perhaps
she
did
not
ask
chainey
to
go
in
perhaps
she
kept
kathleen
from
coming
here
she
has
been
known
to
do
shabby
things
to
cut
other
girls
out
of
their
lovers
not
that
ralph
chainey
is
kathleen
lover
but
he
ought
to
be
they
are
just
suited
to
each
other
both
are
so
splendid
it
may
be
that
alpine
intends
to
catch
him
herself
before
her
sister
gets
a
chance
helen
laughed
a
sage
little
laugh
to
herself
and
added
i
ask
mamma
to
let
us
call
at
carew
and
take
kathleen
with
us
to
the
theater
oh
alpine
where
is
kathleen
george
and
mamma
are
waiting
out
here
in
the
carriage
we
have
just
one
seat
left
and
we
stopped
to
ask
kathleen
to
go
with
us
to
the
theater
mamma
is
out
helen
and
she
would
not
like
it
if
kathleen
went
without
leave
but
mamma
is
with
us
alpine
she
would
chaperon
kathleen
she
can
not
possibly
go
began
alpine
in
a
high
tone
of
authority
but
at
that
moment
a
light
swish
of
silken
draperies
came
through
the
hall
and
a
sweet
voice
said
clearly
kathleen
go
helen
and
she
go
too
if
you
will
wait
till
she
gets
on
her
things
and
alpine
beheld
her
cool
calm
defiant
rustle
up
to
helen
fox
and
kiss
that
piquant
damsel
come
upstairs
with
me
helen
dear
while
i
dress
she
said
radiantly
trying
to
draw
her
toward
the
stairway
for
this
colloquy
had
taken
place
in
the
hall
alpine
followed
them
upstairs
out
of
reach
of
the
servants
ears
and
then
she
said
sharply
you
need
not
get
ready
kathleen
for
i
shall
assume
mamma
authority
in
her
absence
and
forbid
your
going
oh
alpine
where
is
the
harm
pleaded
helen
mamma
has
forbidden
her
to
go
to
the
theater
any
more
this
week
because
she
caught
her
making
eyes
at
an
actor
on
the
stage
last
night
alpine
answered
maliciously
it
is
false
answered
the
young
girl
stung
to
madness
by
wickedness
turning
to
helen
she
said
proudly
i
accept
your
invitation
helen
and
will
accompany
you
to
the
theater
in
spite
of
a
hundred
alpine
belmonts
i
am
no
slave
to
be
domineered
over
in
this
manner
and
alpine
had
better
go
and
leave
me
alone
before
she
arouses
me
any
further
very
well
miss
take
your
own
way
and
defy
but
mamma
will
make
you
repent
it
be
sure
of
that
snapped
alpine
withdrawing
oh
kathleen
i
did
know
i
was
going
to
raise
such
a
breeze
perhaps
you
had
better
not
go
if
carew
objects
helen
said
uneasily
kathleen
turned
on
her
a
face
crimson
with
angry
passion
i
go
if
she
killed
me
for
it
she
cried
with
an
imperious
stamp
of
her
dainty
foot
who
is
that
woman
to
forbid
my
going
to
places
of
amusement
like
other
girls
she
rang
the
bell
violently
for
susette
and
added
say
nothing
before
my
maid
helen
but
on
our
way
to
the
theater
i
tell
you
how
wickedly
alpine
treated
me
this
afternoon
presently
alpine
peeping
through
her
door
saw
the
two
girls
going
away
helen
a
little
uneasy
looking
the
other
proud
defiant
beautiful
as
a
dream
she
will
meet
ralph
chainey
after
all
alpine
muttered
in
a
fury
it
was
midnight
when
fox
carriage
stopped
again
at
the
carew
mansion
and
george
handed
kathleen
out
and
rang
the
bell
for
her
at
her
own
door
the
windows
were
closed
and
not
the
faintest
gleam
of
light
shone
through
them
george
waited
a
few
moments
then
rang
the
bell
again
every
one
must
be
asleep
they
are
so
long
coming
said
kathleen
shivering
in
the
cold
night
air
they
rang
again
furiously
but
there
was
no
response
the
locked
door
the
dark
forbidding
windows
seemed
to
frown
on
their
frantic
efforts
to
arouse
the
house
fox
put
her
head
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
said
kathleen
you
had
better
come
home
with
us
my
dear
i
think
you
will
be
able
to
rouse
any
one
there
and
you
will
catch
cold
waiting
in
the
cool
night
air
chapter
vii
carew
is
going
to
make
you
marry
her
son
said
the
maid
i
thought
of
thee
i
thought
of
thee
through
change
that
teaches
to
forget
thy
face
looks
up
from
every
sea
in
every
star
thine
eyes
are
set
willis
kathleen
was
annoyed
by
her
failure
to
get
into
the
house
but
she
did
not
attach
any
particular
significance
to
it
she
supposed
that
alpine
out
of
spite
had
caused
the
servants
to
lock
up
and
go
to
bed
that
was
all
she
went
home
willingly
enough
with
her
kind
friends
intending
to
return
the
next
morning
and
when
she
laid
her
beautiful
head
on
the
pillow
that
night
it
was
to
dream
of
soft
brown
eyes
that
had
looked
thrillingly
into
hers
and
of
a
warm
white
hand
that
had
clasped
hers
oh
so
closely
when
he
said
for
ralph
chainey
the
actor
or
prince
karl
as
kathleen
called
him
in
her
thoughts
had
come
into
fox
box
twice
between
the
acts
and
had
been
presented
to
the
beautiful
heiress
whose
life
he
had
saved
last
summer
and
from
whose
presence
he
had
gone
away
prince
karl
had
been
on
his
dignity
at
first
he
had
remembered
what
alpine
belmont
had
told
him
that
afternoon
he
believed
that
beautiful
kathleen
was
cold
proud
and
ungrateful
so
after
bowing
over
her
little
hand
when
george
fox
presented
them
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
vivacious
helen
and
scarcely
looked
at
the
radiant
creature
close
to
her
side
kathleen
bit
her
red
lips
and
remained
silent
she
understood
ralph
chainey
mood
and
knew
that
she
had
to
thank
alpine
for
his
indifference
her
sweet
lips
quivered
with
a
repressed
sob
and
her
dark
eyes
swam
in
moisture
that
threatened
to
fall
in
blinding
tears
it
was
hard
cruelly
hard
to
have
him
believe
her
proud
and
ungrateful
and
to
see
him
resent
it
in
this
cavalier
fashion
he
bowed
himself
out
presently
and
then
helen
fox
turned
to
her
eagerly
how
did
you
like
him
kathleen
is
he
just
splendid
she
exclaimed
then
she
saw
how
grave
and
quiet
the
young
girl
looked
and
remembered
what
kathleen
had
told
her
in
the
carriage
oh
i
forgot
he
did
not
really
pass
one
word
with
you
he
was
piqued
and
stiff
over
what
alpine
told
him
she
cried
and
added
consolingly
never
mind
he
come
round
he
admires
you
very
much
i
saw
that
in
his
eyes
and
of
course
he
is
secretly
very
much
interested
in
you
having
saved
your
life
it
is
very
romantic
kathleen
and
i
wonder
if
it
a
match
do
helen
answered
the
girl
somewhat
incoherently
but
helen
laughed
gayly
and
when
the
next
act
was
over
and
the
actor
came
again
for
a
few
minutes
he
found
her
whispering
very
mysteriously
to
her
mother
she
nodded
at
him
and
went
on
confiding
something
to
her
mother
ear
george
fox
had
gone
out
so
there
was
no
one
to
speak
to
but
kathleen
trembling
kathleen
who
blushed
warmly
when
he
came
to
her
side
and
murmured
tremulously
i
want
to
thank
you
for
for
last
summer
it
was
so
good
of
you
so
noble
to
risk
your
life
for
a
a
stranger
pray
do
not
speak
of
it
it
was
nothing
i
ran
no
risk
i
am
a
good
swimmer
he
replied
a
little
stiffly
but
kathleen
went
on
in
that
tremulous
voice
i
i
have
always
remembered
you
with
gratitude
always
longed
to
see
you
again
that
i
might
thank
you
from
my
heart
for
your
goodness
papa
too
wanted
to
see
you
why
did
you
go
away
so
suddenly
where
was
the
arrogance
the
indifference
on
which
alpine
had
expatiated
the
sweet
lips
trembled
there
was
dew
on
the
curling
black
lashes
that
shaded
the
splendid
luring
black
eyes
when
ralph
chainey
had
gazed
into
them
a
moment
he
turned
away
his
head
like
one
dazzled
by
too
much
sunlight
why
did
you
go
away
so
suddenly
she
repeated
and
then
he
said
it
was
because
i
am
an
actor
miss
carew
if
i
had
stayed
to
receive
your
thanks
and
disclosed
my
identity
the
story
would
have
got
into
the
newspapers
and
people
would
have
said
i
did
it
to
get
some
free
advertising
your
name
would
have
gone
all
over
the
country
as
the
heroine
of
the
rescue
you
would
not
have
liked
the
publicity
perhaps
and
so
i
hurried
away
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
think
of
that
she
answered
simply
then
added
hastily
for
the
minutes
were
passing
and
she
knew
he
must
soon
return
to
the
stage
again
chainey
alpine
told
me
what
she
had
told
you
this
afternoon
it
was
was
a
joke
on
her
part
i
recognize
you
last
night
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
i
told
her
who
you
were
she
was
jesting
believe
me
for
i
i
could
not
be
so
ungrateful
as
to
forget
your
face
so
soon
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
he
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
thank
you
he
said
in
his
deep
sweet
voice
pressing
her
hand
warmly
his
magnetic
brown
eyes
gazed
deep
into
hers
and
he
murmured
inaudibly
to
the
others
it
was
the
happiest
moment
i
ever
knew
when
i
saved
your
life
then
he
was
gone
from
the
stage
she
met
his
eyes
twice
fixed
on
her
as
if
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
looking
when
george
fox
put
them
all
into
their
carriage
he
came
out
still
in
his
stage
costume
to
say
he
held
her
hand
just
a
moment
longer
than
helen
and
he
whispered
i
hope
we
shall
meet
again
his
eyes
his
words
his
thrilling
haunted
the
motherless
girl
that
night
in
the
mystical
land
of
dreams
she
arose
early
after
a
rather
restless
night
and
her
first
thought
was
that
she
had
no
i
am
taller
than
helen
so
i
can
not
wear
one
of
hers
neither
can
i
wear
the
costume
i
wore
to
the
theater
last
night
she
murmured
in
perplexity
her
musings
were
cut
short
by
a
tap
at
the
door
susette
her
maid
entered
with
a
large
bundle
miss
kathleen
i
brought
your
for
you
to
come
home
she
said
undoing
the
paper
and
displaying
a
black
silk
costume
oh
how
good
of
you
susette
i
was
just
thinking
i
would
have
to
ask
fox
to
send
around
for
it
carew
sent
me
said
susette
pursing
her
lips
so
she
has
returned
asked
kathleen
resting
her
charming
head
on
her
elbow
and
looking
down
at
the
maid
who
had
seated
herself
on
an
ottoman
close
to
the
bed
she
came
home
near
midnight
last
night
miss
kathleen
near
midnight
why
then
some
one
must
have
been
awake
when
i
came
home
susette
why
did
no
one
answer
the
bell
the
madame
orders
susette
replied
significantly
the
great
dark
eyes
of
kathleen
dilated
in
wonder
but
why
she
began
and
the
maid
interrupted
miss
kathleen
i
did
some
eavesdropping
on
your
account
last
night
and
if
you
not
think
the
worse
of
me
for
it
i
tell
you
carew
plans
the
woman
was
rather
intelligent
and
quite
well
educated
for
one
in
her
position
she
had
been
in
kathleen
service
five
years
and
loved
her
young
mistress
dearly
her
devotion
to
her
interests
had
won
her
a
warm
place
in
kathleen
heart
go
on
she
said
and
susette
continued
when
madame
went
away
yesterday
it
was
somewhere
into
the
country
where
there
a
where
you
are
to
be
sent
susette
it
the
gospel
truth
miss
they
packed
your
trunk
last
night
all
ready
for
you
to
start
that
why
they
would
let
you
in
you
were
not
to
know
anything
to
send
me
back
to
school
exclaimed
the
young
girl
in
such
amazement
that
the
words
came
with
difficulty
from
her
lips
her
eyes
flashed
with
anger
i
will
not
go
she
can
not
force
me
she
declared
she
intends
to
you
go
i
heard
her
tell
miss
belmont
so
said
the
maid
looking
very
sad
for
she
knew
that
carew
will
was
law
kathleen
face
grew
scarlet
with
passion
and
there
was
a
dangerous
light
in
her
eyes
but
she
did
not
answer
springing
from
the
couch
she
allowed
susette
to
attire
her
in
her
black
silk
i
thought
maybe
if
i
told
you
beforehand
that
maybe
you
could
think
of
some
way
to
outwit
her
said
the
maid
and
i
will
i
i
will
never
be
sent
to
school
again
cried
the
girl
in
something
almost
like
terror
she
clasped
her
little
hands
and
sighed
oh
why
did
papa
ever
go
away
and
leave
me
here
in
that
woman
power
she
was
always
cruel
to
me
but
she
did
not
dare
so
much
while
he
was
here
oh
i
wish
he
would
come
home
to
his
poor
kathleen
bitter
burning
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
and
dropped
on
her
heaving
bosom
it
was
so
hard
to
be
ruled
by
this
coarse
woman
who
envied
and
hated
her
in
the
same
breath
she
is
going
to
make
you
marry
her
son
too
she
told
her
daughter
that
she
was
determined
to
bring
that
about
so
he
might
share
your
fortune
susette
remarked
at
this
juncture
chapter
viii
please
buy
my
diamond
necklace
said
kathleen
i
no
mother
now
i
weeping
she
has
left
me
here
alone
she
beneath
the
sod
is
sleeping
now
there
is
no
joy
at
home
before
kathleen
could
reply
the
door
opened
softly
and
helen
fox
came
in
with
two
letters
in
her
hand
kissing
kathleen
good
morning
she
exclaimed
what
do
you
think
the
postman
has
just
brought
me
a
proposal
from
loyal
graham
queried
her
friend
helen
blushed
up
to
her
eyes
but
answered
gayly
no
indeed
from
teddy
darrell
kathleen
arched
her
black
eyebrows
in
surprise
teddy
darrell
why
he
proposed
to
last
week
she
said
and
did
he
ask
you
to
keep
it
a
asked
helen
consulting
her
letter
her
blue
eyes
dancing
with
fun
yes
he
did
now
that
i
recall
it
oh
my
i
sorry
i
mentioned
it
but
you
took
me
by
surprise
there
no
harm
done
my
dear
and
you
need
not
look
so
bless
you
i
do
mean
to
keep
it
a
secret
although
he
prays
me
here
to
do
so
why
teddy
darrell
is
the
worst
flirt
in
boston
and
proposes
to
a
new
girl
every
week
always
trying
to
keep
the
new
love
a
secret
from
the
old
one
but
does
no
one
ever
accept
him
helen
perhaps
i
do
know
i
sure
i
and
i
just
dying
to
tell
the
girls
why
only
last
week
we
were
comparing
notes
over
him
and
out
of
seven
girls
in
the
crowd
he
had
asked
five
to
marry
him
maud
sylvester
said
i
be
the
next
one
on
his
list
and
you
see
i
am
but
how
can
he
fall
in
love
so
often
queried
kathleen
laughing
he
very
susceptible
i
suppose
or
maybe
it
all
in
fun
you
know
some
young
men
like
to
be
engaged
to
several
girls
at
once
so
they
can
boast
of
their
conquests
and
maybe
he
one
of
them
well
i
must
lacerate
his
poor
heart
by
a
refusal
with
a
mock
sigh
who
will
be
his
next
victim
asked
kathleen
either
maud
sylvester
or
katie
wells
one
is
an
actress
the
other
a
novelist
he
is
wild
over
both
fraternities
how
amusing
laughed
her
friend
but
your
other
letter
helen
is
it
another
proposal
no
this
is
an
invitation
to
attend
a
flower
show
from
loyal
graham
helen
answered
a
little
consciously
but
kathleen
how
pale
you
are
did
you
not
sleep
well
no
i
was
restless
answered
the
girl
she
debated
within
herself
whether
she
ought
to
tell
helen
of
the
news
susette
had
brought
she
concluded
that
she
would
not
just
yet
come
we
will
go
down
to
breakfast
dear
helen
said
drawing
an
arm
through
kathleen
to
lead
her
away
susette
you
need
not
go
back
yet
i
shall
want
you
after
a
while
said
kathleen
and
the
maid
remained
very
willingly
kathleen
smiled
talked
ate
and
drank
in
a
mechanical
fashion
she
was
busy
revolving
schemes
for
escaping
her
threatening
fate
kathleen
had
not
been
home
from
school
more
than
six
months
the
idea
of
returning
to
it
and
leaving
the
social
whirl
that
as
yet
was
so
new
and
charming
was
not
to
be
tolerated
and
just
as
i
had
met
ralph
chainey
too
she
said
to
herself
in
keen
dismay
her
mind
was
on
a
rack
of
torture
she
was
afraid
that
open
rebellion
would
not
avail
her
foe
was
keen
and
subtle
she
would
employ
strategy
to
compass
her
ends
i
ought
to
meet
her
with
her
own
weapons
she
thought
and
all
at
once
she
began
to
wonder
if
she
could
not
quietly
get
away
and
go
south
to
her
dead
mother
relatives
there
to
remain
until
the
return
of
her
father
should
make
her
safe
from
persecution
two
hours
later
kathleen
bade
her
friends
and
walked
away
with
susette
as
they
supposed
toward
her
home
little
did
helen
fox
as
she
gazed
with
loving
eyes
after
her
beautiful
form
dream
of
the
tragic
doom
hanging
over
kathleen
carew
susette
i
am
not
going
home
with
you
she
said
the
maid
looked
inquiringly
into
the
beautiful
young
face
and
kathleen
added
determinedly
i
am
going
straight
to
the
station
where
i
shall
take
the
train
and
go
south
to
my
mother
relatives
to
remain
until
papa
gets
back
to
free
me
from
that
woman
tyranny
oh
miss
kathleen
do
you
think
that
will
be
for
the
best
inquired
susette
timorously
of
course
it
will
susette
for
they
will
be
kind
to
me
for
my
dead
mother
sake
and
you
will
have
me
to
pet
you
and
care
for
you
said
the
affectionate
maid
i
can
not
take
you
with
me
susette
for
it
might
get
you
into
trouble
you
good
soul
and
i
do
want
to
do
that
i
can
take
care
of
myself
never
fear
no
you
are
to
go
straight
back
home
and
say
that
i
sent
you
and
will
follow
presently
susette
began
to
sob
dismally
and
kathleen
had
to
draw
her
aside
into
a
pretty
little
park
where
they
seated
themselves
and
talked
softly
for
some
time
then
kathleen
arose
and
pressed
her
sweet
rosy
lips
to
the
woman
wet
cheeks
now
for
a
few
weeks
only
susette
dear
for
as
soon
as
papa
returns
i
be
back
if
carew
turns
you
out
go
to
helen
fox
and
ask
her
to
give
you
employment
while
i
am
away
she
will
do
it
for
my
sake
i
know
and
i
write
to
you
at
helen
as
soon
as
i
get
to
richmond
how
fortunate
that
i
have
my
diamonds
with
me
for
i
can
go
to
the
jeweler
and
sell
enough
to
carry
me
on
my
journey
oh
susette
do
sob
so
please
dear
god
bless
you
she
signaled
a
passing
cab
gave
the
order
golden
glitter
tremont
street
and
was
driven
swiftly
away
it
was
a
bright
cool
morning
in
april
and
tremont
street
was
thronged
with
shoppers
and
business
people
as
she
stepped
out
of
the
cab
in
front
of
the
jeweler
elegant
shop
bidding
the
cab
wait
the
young
girl
drew
down
her
lace
veil
and
entered
without
noticing
in
her
preoccupation
the
tall
blonde
young
man
with
a
small
satchel
in
his
hand
who
was
intently
gazing
into
the
jeweler
window
with
a
covetous
gleam
in
his
pale
eyes
but
the
young
man
eyes
turned
aside
from
the
contemplation
of
the
treasures
displayed
within
the
heavy
window
and
fastened
on
the
beautiful
young
girl
with
her
patrician
air
and
elegant
costume
kathleen
as
i
live
he
exclaimed
with
a
violent
start
and
followed
her
stealthily
into
the
shop
the
elegant
place
was
thronged
with
shoppers
and
he
mingled
with
them
keeping
close
to
kathleen
although
unobserved
by
the
object
of
his
espionage
i
wish
i
had
the
money
that
lucky
girl
is
going
to
spend
he
muttered
enviously
to
himself
kathleen
went
immediately
to
the
desk
of
golden
the
senior
partner
of
the
firm
drawing
a
small
black
case
from
her
pocket
she
opened
it
displaying
a
very
pretty
diamond
necklace
golden
of
course
you
remember
when
papa
bought
this
necklace
here
for
me
she
said
timidly
he
paid
five
thousand
dollars
for
it
you
know
well
papa
is
away
with
a
catch
in
her
breath
and
i
i
need
some
money
very
much
will
you
do
me
the
favor
of
buying
this
back
for
whatever
you
will
give
me
the
kindly
gentleman
drew
a
check
toward
him
and
began
to
write
rapidly
will
a
thousand
dollars
do
you
my
dear
young
lady
because
you
can
take
that
and
leave
the
necklace
as
security
for
the
loan
you
can
redeem
it
when
your
father
gets
back
he
said
beaming
genially
upon
her
for
the
carews
were
among
his
best
customers
chapter
ix
murdered
as
i
came
through
the
valley
of
despair
as
i
came
through
the
valley
on
my
sight
more
awful
than
the
darkness
of
the
night
shone
glimpses
of
a
past
that
had
been
fair
when
kathleen
had
thanked
golden
for
his
ready
kindness
and
gratefully
accepted
the
check
she
hastened
to
the
bank
on
the
next
block
and
had
it
cashed
in
some
large
and
a
few
bills
of
smaller
denomination
she
had
left
cabby
waiting
for
her
in
front
of
the
jewelers
telling
him
that
as
soon
as
she
returned
from
the
bank
she
wanted
him
to
drive
her
to
the
station
to
take
the
first
train
for
the
south
accordingly
she
returned
in
a
few
minutes
and
sprung
into
the
cab
little
dreaming
that
she
was
watched
and
followed
by
the
tall
blonde
young
man
who
had
recognized
her
when
she
had
alighted
at
golden
glitter
and
followed
her
into
the
store
he
had
secured
a
cab
for
himself
and
was
following
fast
upon
her
track
now
what
is
up
with
the
heiress
must
be
an
elopement
egad
alpine
told
me
she
was
in
love
with
a
handsome
actor
and
that
the
was
going
to
take
her
back
to
school
to
save
her
for
me
deuce
take
her
i
do
want
her
only
for
the
money
she
get
from
old
carew
i
was
always
afraid
of
those
snapping
black
eyes
of
hers
i
rather
have
that
little
new
york
ballet
dancer
of
mine
in
spite
of
her
extravagance
a
thousand
dollars
a
cool
thousand
that
what
the
little
minx
wants
me
to
give
her
now
or
but
i
wo
think
of
that
it
makes
me
savage
a
thousand
dollars
that
what
kathleen
carew
has
in
her
purse
this
moment
besides
the
diamond
on
her
finger
and
her
real
diamonds
inside
the
little
gold
balls
she
wears
snapped
over
them
in
daytime
i
wish
i
had
for
my
little
duck
would
she
be
sweet
with
great
sparklers
in
her
pink
ears
and
to
think
that
the
refused
me
the
check
i
begged
her
for
this
morning
and
she
rolling
in
old
carew
money
while
her
only
son
could
not
keep
up
any
style
at
all
only
for
gambling
ran
the
tenor
of
his
thoughts
as
he
pursued
hapless
kathleen
to
the
station
making
up
his
mind
that
she
was
about
to
elope
and
grimly
determining
that
she
should
purchase
his
silence
with
her
money
and
jewels
and
cheap
getting
off
like
that
when
i
might
take
her
back
to
mother
and
keep
her
for
myself
egad
maybe
the
actor
will
pay
me
something
on
his
own
account
d
n
the
lucky
rascal
he
muttered
to
his
amazement
no
person
met
kathleen
at
the
station
she
bought
her
ticket
alone
and
entered
the
parlor
car
of
the
vestibule
train
going
south
to
richmond
hey
running
away
alone
and
to
those
poor
relations
of
hers
i
be
bound
no
chance
then
of
getting
any
of
her
boodle
for
my
dearie
she
will
need
it
all
for
they
say
the
franklyns
her
mother
relations
are
poor
as
job
turkey
hen
well
i
follow
and
we
see
if
anything
turns
up
to
my
advantage
and
buying
a
ticket
as
far
as
philadelphia
he
entered
the
train
after
first
disguising
himself
by
taking
from
his
hand
satchel
and
putting
on
a
dark
wig
and
dark
heavy
whiskers
the
train
rushed
on
and
on
through
the
land
but
kathleen
sobbing
under
her
veil
took
no
heed
of
time
day
passed
and
it
was
far
into
the
night
the
train
rushed
into
a
lonely
woodland
station
snorted
and
stopped
while
the
conductor
shouted
passengers
for
the
south
change
cars
here
kathleen
and
a
single
gentleman
seemed
the
only
southern
passengers
they
groped
their
way
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
starless
night
the
other
train
was
waiting
on
the
other
side
of
a
small
wooden
depot
kathleen
confused
by
the
strangeness
and
darkness
staggered
shiveringly
forward
on
the
muddy
path
alone
and
frightened
at
the
solitude
a
stealthy
step
behind
her
two
throttling
hands
at
her
throat
smothering
her
startled
cry
she
was
thrown
violently
down
the
jewels
wrenched
from
her
hands
and
ears
the
purse
from
her
dress
then
the
murderer
fled
toward
the
waiting
train
leaving
his
victim
for
dead
upon
the
ground
chapter
x
at
dead
of
night
i
gaze
on
her
frozen
face
her
mystical
sightless
eyes
and
now
even
now
her
grace
the
power
of
death
defies
benners
kathleen
lay
still
and
white
under
the
starless
sky
like
one
dead
and
there
was
no
one
to
come
to
her
rescue
for
the
telegraph
operator
busy
at
his
instrument
dreamed
not
of
her
proximity
and
at
this
hour
of
the
night
there
were
no
loiterers
about
in
the
village
swiftly
and
silently
had
the
fiend
escaped
and
it
was
most
probable
that
day
would
dawn
ere
any
one
would
discover
the
beautiful
girl
lying
out
there
in
the
rear
of
the
depot
upon
the
damp
muddy
ground
dead
and
cold
but
to
return
to
boston
which
our
heroine
had
so
unceremoniously
quitted
her
last
thought
as
the
train
steamed
away
with
her
was
of
ralph
chainey
the
handsome
actor
who
had
looked
so
tenderly
into
her
eyes
and
who
had
whispered
as
he
held
her
hand
at
parting
i
hope
we
shall
meet
again
her
tears
had
started
at
the
memory
it
is
all
over
she
sighed
he
will
be
gone
away
from
boston
before
i
go
back
and
i
shall
never
see
him
again
but
at
that
very
moment
events
were
shaping
themselves
in
ralph
chainey
life
so
as
to
bring
him
to
her
side
again
in
his
room
at
the
thorndike
hotel
he
was
reading
a
telegram
that
said
come
at
once
fedora
is
ill
perhaps
dying
his
handsome
face
grew
grave
and
troubled
throwing
down
the
telegram
he
sought
his
manager
every
engagement
for
this
week
must
be
canceled
i
must
go
south
on
the
first
train
but
my
dear
chainey
the
loss
will
amount
to
thousands
of
dollars
expostulated
the
reluctant
manager
no
matter
let
the
loss
be
mine
a
some
one
is
ill
dying
i
must
go
i
am
very
sorry
we
were
having
a
splendid
success
here
sighed
the
manager
but
his
regrets
did
not
deter
the
young
man
from
going
two
hours
after
kathleen
had
left
boston
he
drove
up
to
the
same
station
where
she
had
taken
the
train
for
the
south
and
entered
another
one
going
in
the
same
direction
meanwhile
susette
sauntered
back
to
beacon
street
with
the
message
kathleen
had
dictated
she
would
be
at
home
later
on
carew
was
indignant
she
had
been
planning
to
take
kathleen
away
by
the
noon
train
her
trunk
already
strapped
and
corded
stood
in
the
hall
susette
received
a
severe
scolding
for
leaving
her
young
mistress
but
she
did
not
seem
much
affected
by
it
she
is
my
mistress
and
i
should
not
dare
to
disobey
her
orders
she
replied
and
walked
out
of
the
room
what
shall
you
do
now
asked
alpine
curiously
i
must
wait
and
take
her
on
a
later
train
ringing
a
bell
she
sent
her
own
maid
to
commonwealth
avenue
to
bring
home
her
tardy
ellen
returned
with
the
news
that
kathleen
had
left
fox
several
hours
ago
and
with
susette
too
said
the
elderly
maid
sourly
for
she
cherished
a
secret
grudge
against
kathleen
maid
who
was
younger
than
herself
better
looking
and
had
insnared
the
affections
of
james
the
butler
susette
was
recalled
on
being
questioned
she
readily
admitted
that
kathleen
had
started
home
with
her
but
sent
her
on
ahead
promising
to
follow
while
the
angry
stormed
and
raved
over
willfulness
awaiting
her
return
in
impotent
anger
the
young
girl
was
flying
fast
from
her
tyranny
and
nearer
to
the
fate
that
loomed
darkly
in
the
near
future
the
flying
train
sped
on
through
the
night
with
ralph
chainey
he
had
thrown
himself
down
dressed
upon
his
berth
for
the
porter
had
told
him
that
he
would
have
to
change
cars
at
midnight
he
was
restless
and
troubled
no
sleep
visited
his
eyes
in
spite
of
himself
his
thought
turned
back
to
boston
to
kathleen
carew
she
haunted
him
with
her
musical
voice
and
luring
eyes
at
last
a
deep
groan
forced
itself
through
his
lips
i
would
to
heaven
we
had
never
met
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
deep
despair
pushing
back
the
light
curtain
he
looked
out
into
the
night
it
had
grown
cold
and
bleak
a
light
patter
of
mingled
rain
and
snow
was
beating
against
the
window
how
dreary
the
young
man
murmured
with
a
shudder
and
added
in
a
sort
of
awe
dying
can
that
be
true
the
porter
who
was
very
attentive
the
result
of
a
liberal
tip
came
and
put
his
head
between
the
curtains
we
change
cars
at
the
next
station
chainey
and
that
but
a
few
miles
away
you
better
be
getting
ready
ralph
came
into
the
little
and
the
man
assisted
him
into
his
overcoat
a
few
minutes
more
and
the
train
was
slowing
up
at
the
lonely
station
you
the
only
person
getting
off
sir
sir
a
pleasant
journey
the
porter
handed
out
ralph
valise
and
he
stepped
down
into
the
darkness
while
the
train
went
its
way
but
where
the
dickens
is
the
other
one
soliloquized
the
young
man
standing
still
a
moment
the
light
snow
pelting
his
face
while
he
peered
into
the
darkness
for
the
locomotive
it
must
be
behind
that
little
depot
here
goes
for
a
tour
of
investigation
and
with
his
valise
in
hand
he
strode
forward
in
the
darkness
hardly
knowing
where
he
went
and
wondering
at
the
scarcity
of
railway
officials
and
light
the
train
ca
be
here
it
is
probably
late
he
thought
and
then
his
foot
tripped
and
he
fell
headlong
over
a
body
lying
in
his
path
a
shudder
of
nameless
horror
shook
the
young
man
as
he
scrambled
to
an
erect
position
muttering
good
heavens
a
woman
i
know
from
the
silken
garments
now
what
is
she
doing
out
here
on
the
ground
in
this
cimmerian
darkness
with
the
snow
coming
down
in
a
fury
he
raised
his
voice
and
shouted
loudly
halloo
halloo
the
closed
door
of
the
depot
with
its
one
blinking
lighted
window
opened
and
then
the
form
of
a
man
appeared
in
the
opening
who
is
it
and
what
the
matter
he
exclaimed
shortly
bring
a
lantern
out
here
i
found
a
woman
dead
in
the
snow
was
the
startling
answer
ralph
had
knelt
down
and
felt
the
face
and
hands
of
the
motionless
woman
they
were
cold
as
ice
and
he
realized
that
she
was
dead
horrible
he
murmured
and
while
he
waited
for
the
man
to
come
with
the
lantern
little
thrills
of
awe
ran
through
him
the
flesh
he
had
touched
was
firm
and
young
the
hair
was
soft
and
curly
the
garments
silken
who
was
she
and
why
was
she
out
here
under
the
night
sky
cold
and
dead
the
depot
agent
came
hurrying
out
through
the
driving
snow
and
flashed
the
light
of
his
lantern
full
into
their
faces
for
ralph
was
still
kneeling
down
by
the
motionless
form
who
are
you
and
what
is
the
row
he
inquired
curiously
but
ralph
did
not
reply
he
was
gazing
in
terror
at
the
silent
face
with
its
closed
eyes
that
lay
so
pale
and
still
before
him
wet
with
the
falling
snow
the
bronze
curls
tangled
on
the
forehead
drops
of
blood
congealed
on
the
ears
and
oh
horror
the
white
throat
and
chin
had
dark
crimson
upon
them
the
small
velvet
hat
had
fallen
off
the
dress
pocket
was
turned
inside
out
one
hand
had
the
glove
torn
off
and
was
wounded
where
a
ring
had
been
wrenched
from
it
oh
heaven
groaned
ralph
chainey
in
a
low
voice
of
shuddering
horror
and
the
man
exclaimed
why
this
looks
like
robbery
and
murder
see
her
pocket
has
been
turned
inside
out
a
ring
has
been
torn
from
her
finger
a
diamond
very
likely
and
her
ears
are
bleeding
where
her
have
been
torn
out
look
at
the
red
marks
on
her
throat
good
lord
she
has
certainly
been
choked
and
robbed
by
some
devil
in
human
shape
mister
who
are
you
and
where
did
you
come
from
and
how
did
you
find
her
ralph
chainey
whose
face
had
grown
as
white
as
the
dead
one
before
him
did
not
reply
save
by
a
second
groan
of
unutterable
horror
he
was
wringing
his
hands
in
dismay
and
the
expression
of
his
eyes
was
one
of
bitterest
anguish
not
until
the
man
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
and
plied
him
over
and
over
with
questions
did
he
reply
telling
him
in
disjointed
sentences
the
simple
truth
of
how
he
came
there
and
adding
if
i
am
not
mistaken
she
is
miss
carew
a
young
boston
lady
whom
i
met
there
only
last
night
how
she
came
here
what
is
the
mystery
of
this
i
can
not
understand
chapter
xi
the
fatal
telegram
the
young
village
maid
when
with
flowers
she
dresses
her
dark
flowing
hair
for
some
festival
day
will
think
of
thy
face
till
neglecting
her
tresses
she
mournfully
turns
from
the
mirror
away
poor
thing
she
must
have
been
a
beauty
the
railway
employé
said
as
he
contemplated
kathleen
cold
and
beautiful
face
come
let
us
carry
her
into
the
house
and
get
a
doctor
maybe
she
ai
really
dead
only
swooned
he
continued
hopefully
and
between
them
they
bore
her
in
and
laid
her
on
a
bench
made
soft
with
their
overcoats
then
the
man
ran
to
his
instrument
which
was
ticking
busily
away
and
directly
said
your
train
is
several
hours
late
sir
so
if
you
stay
here
run
and
fetch
a
doctor
he
flashed
out
at
the
door
and
in
the
shabby
little
ralph
chainey
was
alone
with
beautiful
dead
kathleen
so
cruelly
murdered
he
knelt
down
by
her
side
in
an
agony
of
dumb
despair
he
gazed
through
blinding
tears
upon
the
sweet
white
face
he
took
her
cold
white
hand
and
kissed
the
wound
upon
it
and
then
he
whispered
as
if
she
could
hear
him
beautiful
kathleen
you
will
never
know
now
how
dearly
i
have
loved
you
since
first
i
saw
your
face
you
are
dead
dead
and
soon
the
dark
earth
will
cover
you
away
forever
from
the
sight
of
men
ah
if
only
those
dead
lips
could
unclose
long
enough
to
tell
me
the
name
of
your
dastardly
murderer
i
would
pursue
him
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
but
that
i
would
bring
him
to
punishment
he
bent
his
head
until
his
pale
lips
touched
the
rigid
ones
of
the
dead
girl
they
were
icy
cold
but
the
soft
curls
of
bright
hair
that
lightly
brushed
his
forehead
how
soft
how
silken
how
alive
they
felt
but
she
was
dead
this
girl
who
had
blushed
last
night
beneath
his
glance
whose
voice
had
been
so
sweet
and
low
when
she
spoke
to
him
ah
fate
is
a
cruel
lord
a
tyrant
at
best
his
rule
and
we
learn
by
sin
and
sword
while
here
in
his
rigid
school
ah
me
i
left
her
with
hopes
beguiled
we
parted
and
fate
looked
on
and
smiled
the
shock
and
horror
of
the
occasion
began
to
overcome
him
strong
man
as
he
was
and
his
head
reeled
consciousness
forsook
him
he
fell
in
a
crouching
position
upon
the
floor
where
he
lay
until
the
doctor
entered
followed
by
his
gentle
girlish
wife
oh
the
dear
sweet
pretty
creature
what
an
awful
way
for
her
to
meet
such
a
fate
the
murderer
ought
to
be
burned
at
the
stake
exclaimed
the
young
wife
sorrowfully
and
her
tears
fell
fast
on
kathleen
face
doctor
churchman
examined
the
girl
throat
carefully
and
said
with
a
deep
sigh
poor
thing
she
is
quite
dead
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
for
her
but
to
carry
her
over
to
our
house
and
take
care
of
the
body
until
her
friends
come
a
deep
groan
startled
him
and
ralph
chainey
staggered
dizzily
to
his
feet
ah
sir
so
you
have
recognized
this
young
woman
dickson
tells
me
well
please
dictate
a
telegraph
message
to
her
friends
at
once
doctor
churchman
said
to
him
gently
for
the
despairing
look
on
the
young
man
face
touched
him
with
sympathy
he
must
have
been
in
love
with
the
murdered
girl
he
said
to
himself
ralph
went
into
the
little
office
and
sent
a
message
off
to
carew
address
i
have
found
kathleen
carew
here
dead
under
very
mysterious
circumstances
please
come
immediately
as
i
am
compelled
to
leave
by
one
of
those
strange
rulings
of
fate
that
so
startle
us
at
times
a
mistake
was
made
at
the
boston
office
in
taking
the
message
and
when
received
by
carew
the
telegram
ran
thus
i
have
married
kathleen
carew
and
nothing
can
change
it
please
god
in
heaven
i
am
comforted
to
know
it
carew
raved
with
anger
and
the
very
next
day
the
boston
papers
published
as
a
sensational
item
miss
carew
elopement
and
marriage
to
the
handsome
actor
who
charmed
all
women
hearts
out
of
their
keeping
ralph
washburn
chainey
carew
active
malice
could
invent
but
one
sting
for
the
heart
of
her
at
so
short
a
notice
she
cabled
at
once
to
vincent
carew
in
london
a
garbled
account
of
kathleen
elopement
with
an
actor
one
of
the
lowest
and
most
unprincipled
professionals
who
had
ever
disgraced
the
stage
vincent
carew
had
just
been
buying
his
ticket
to
return
to
america
his
health
was
restored
and
his
heart
ached
for
a
sight
of
his
bonny
kathleen
his
beloved
daughter
close
against
his
heart
lay
her
picture
and
her
last
sweet
loving
letter
in
which
she
implored
him
to
come
home
to
his
unhappy
child
she
did
not
mention
her
unkindness
but
a
vague
suspicion
stirred
within
him
and
prompted
his
speedy
return
his
ticket
was
bought
his
luggage
with
so
many
beautiful
gifts
for
kathleen
stored
in
it
was
sent
down
to
the
steamer
he
smiled
as
he
thought
of
the
surprise
in
store
for
his
home
folks
upon
this
complacent
mood
came
the
malicious
cablegram
from
his
irate
wife
the
revulsion
from
his
pleasant
mood
to
keen
wrath
was
terrible
vincent
carew
had
a
dislike
to
actors
in
general
of
which
no
one
understood
the
origin
the
thought
of
his
bonny
kathleen
married
to
one
of
this
abhorred
class
drove
the
proud
man
beside
himself
with
shame
and
rage
for
an
hour
he
raged
and
stormed
about
his
room
until
he
was
on
the
verge
of
apoplexy
having
exhausted
the
first
fury
of
his
anger
he
flung
himself
into
a
cab
and
was
driven
in
haste
to
a
lawyer
office
his
last
act
on
leaving
england
was
to
execute
his
last
will
and
testament
in
which
he
angrily
disinherited
kathleen
his
only
child
leaving
the
document
with
the
lawyer
for
safe
keeping
with
instructions
to
forward
it
to
america
in
case
of
his
loss
at
sea
the
angry
man
was
driven
down
to
the
steamer
and
embarked
for
home
the
home
that
would
be
so
lonely
now
without
the
light
of
starry
dark
eyes
did
he
repent
his
harsh
and
hasty
deed
that
haughty
man
as
he
paced
the
steamer
deck
those
long
moonlight
nights
thinking
of
his
dead
wife
lovely
childish
zaidee
and
the
daughter
she
had
left
him
willful
spirited
kathleen
did
he
shudder
with
fear
as
he
remembered
that
should
anything
happen
to
him
at
sea
the
cruel
will
that
disinherited
the
young
girl
would
be
irrevocable
or
did
he
gloat
over
the
prospect
of
her
sufferings
with
her
impecunious
husband
no
one
knew
for
in
his
bitter
trouble
and
humiliation
he
stood
proudly
aloof
from
all
cultivating
no
one
friendship
seemingly
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
until
night
that
night
of
awful
storm
and
darkness
when
fatal
disaster
overtook
the
good
ship
and
she
was
burned
at
sea
her
fate
sending
a
thrill
of
horror
through
the
heart
of
the
world
when
the
tidings
became
known
with
vincent
name
among
the
lost
chapter
xii
kathleen
i
swear
that
i
will
avenge
your
murder
my
idol
is
dead
my
queen
i
stand
by
her
frozen
clay
and
bitterly
wail
kathleen
come
back
to
my
heart
i
pray
but
only
the
moaning
storm
winds
sigh
come
back
come
back
as
they
hurry
by
benners
jr
gentle
womanly
hands
prepared
lovely
hapless
kathleen
for
the
grave
and
she
was
laid
upon
a
white
bier
in
doctor
churchman
pretty
parlor
very
pale
and
beautiful
she
looked
and
as
ralph
chainey
bent
over
her
for
one
farewell
look
she
did
not
seem
like
one
dead
but
just
asleep
it
even
seemed
as
though
the
white
flowers
on
her
breast
moved
softly
as
with
a
gentle
breath
but
when
he
hastened
to
hold
a
mirror
over
her
lips
it
remained
clear
without
any
moisture
he
laid
it
down
with
a
bitter
groan
his
delayed
train
would
arrive
in
a
few
moments
and
he
was
compelled
to
leave
the
dead
girl
side
for
a
he
must
leave
kathleen
here
with
these
kind
sympathetic
people
but
he
would
return
as
soon
as
he
could
for
there
must
be
an
inquest
at
which
he
must
be
the
chief
witness
he
wondered
how
her
relatives
would
take
it
her
stately
her
pretty
who
had
told
him
such
unblushing
falsehoods
about
kathleen
helen
fox
will
be
sorry
i
know
for
she
loved
kathleen
dearly
he
murmured
aloud
tears
fell
from
his
beautiful
brown
eyes
upon
the
angelic
face
and
he
went
on
talking
to
the
girl
in
a
low
monotone
almost
forgetting
that
she
could
not
hear
him
or
perhaps
fancying
that
her
gentle
spirit
hovered
near
my
darling
you
will
never
know
how
dearly
i
loved
you
nor
how
i
shall
mourn
you
all
my
life
long
once
i
saved
your
life
and
oh
why
did
not
heaven
give
me
that
joy
again
why
did
i
come
too
late
with
a
groan
he
laid
his
hand
softly
on
the
one
that
clasped
the
white
flowers
on
her
breast
and
added
kathleen
i
swear
that
i
will
avenge
your
murder
if
it
takes
me
all
my
life
to
do
it
and
costs
me
all
my
fortune
he
bent
and
pressed
his
lips
on
her
white
brow
and
her
soft
curls
took
a
white
rosebud
from
under
her
pulseless
hand
and
placed
it
in
his
breast
then
he
was
gone
presently
when
the
excited
villagers
began
filing
in
to
look
at
the
murdered
girl
they
saw
a
that
had
fallen
from
his
eyes
glittering
like
a
pearl
on
the
bosom
of
her
black
silk
dress
the
little
community
was
wild
with
horror
and
excitement
at
the
finding
of
the
murdered
girl
in
their
midst
and
when
it
became
known
that
she
had
been
recognized
as
a
great
boston
heiress
the
became
even
greater
the
telegraph
wires
flashed
the
news
from
town
to
city
and
the
newspapers
that
one
day
had
chronicled
the
news
of
elopement
printed
hours
afterward
in
flaring
the
awful
story
of
her
robbery
and
murder
even
carew
wicked
as
she
was
paled
to
the
lips
as
she
read
it
and
alpine
fainted
outright
weak
selfish
cruel
as
the
girl
was
she
had
cared
for
kathleen
more
than
she
knew
the
girl
charms
had
won
upon
her
in
spite
of
herself
good
heavens
that
actor
he
has
robbed
and
murdered
her
the
fiend
carew
cried
violently
he
is
even
worse
than
i
thought
i
do
not
believe
it
mamma
there
is
some
mistake
there
must
be
ralph
chainey
was
a
gentleman
and
rich
in
his
own
right
alpine
answered
speaking
the
truth
for
once
like
every
one
else
she
admired
the
young
actor
and
though
his
preference
for
kathleen
had
angered
her
she
was
not
prepared
to
do
him
the
flagrant
injustice
of
believing
him
as
wicked
as
her
mother
asserted
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
carew
exclaimed
with
a
startled
air
good
heavens
alpine
think
what
this
means
to
us
kathleen
dead
the
whole
carew
fortune
is
ours
alpine
had
the
grace
to
be
ashamed
how
can
you
think
of
that
she
exclaimed
reproachfully
i
i
had
rather
know
that
that
kathleen
was
alive
than
have
the
wealth
of
the
vanderbilts
then
she
burst
into
tears
and
left
the
room
in
a
hurry
carew
looked
after
her
aghast
i
did
not
think
she
would
take
it
so
hard
but
then
i
always
suspected
her
at
times
of
a
sneaking
fondness
for
that
witch
she
mused
well
i
do
mind
it
will
look
better
in
society
a
little
real
grief
on
alpine
part
as
for
me
i
glad
she
out
of
the
way
and
the
carew
wealth
assured
to
me
and
mine
she
gave
a
low
laugh
of
satisfaction
but
her
hands
were
shaking
with
excitement
and
her
heart
fluttered
strangely
she
was
recalling
the
coincidence
of
kathleen
and
her
mother
deaths
both
at
nearly
the
same
age
sixteen
and
both
by
violent
means
the
maid
came
so
suddenly
into
the
room
that
it
gave
her
a
violent
shock
she
started
and
looked
around
angrily
why
do
you
enter
the
room
so
rudely
without
knocking
ellen
i
beg
pardon
madame
i
knocked
but
you
did
not
hear
so
i
made
bold
to
enter
because
miss
belmont
sent
me
in
a
hurry
well
she
desires
to
know
if
i
shall
get
your
things
ready
to
go
after
miss
carew
body
the
woman
spoke
in
an
unmoved
tone
her
mistress
had
taught
her
to
hate
the
fair
young
heiress
she
means
to
go
interrogated

she
is
getting
ready

and
told
me

in
the
absence
of
my
husband
and
son
it
is
my
harrowing
duty

to
her
dry
eyes
and
sighed

chapter

another
mystery
ah
you
or
i
must
look
into
the
other
coffin
far
or
near
and
read
as
in
a
book
words
we
made
bitter
here
some
time
there
was
a
little
flutter
of
excitement
at
doctor
churchman
pretty
cottage
the
carews
had
at
last
arrived
after
being
vainly
looked
for
for
more
than
two
days
and
their
aristocratic
airs
and
their
stylish
maid
created
quite
a
sensation
kathleen
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
little
parlor
kathleen
with
shut
eyes
and
pallid
lips
and
folded
waxen
hands
so
unlike
the
brilliant
beauty
they
remembered
with
this
awful
calm
upon
her
face
they
gazed
upon
her
and
carew
lips
twitched
nervously
while
alpine
wept
genuine
tears
remembering
remorsefully
how
kind
kathleen
had
been
and
how
illy
she
had
repaid
her
goodness
ralph
had
not
come
yet
but
a
telegram
from
richmond
had
arrived
announcing
that
he
would
come
early
in
the
morning
when
arrangements
had
been
made
to
hold
an
inquest
churchman
placed
rooms
at
the
service
of
the
ladies
and
they
retired
early
pleading
fatigue
but
really
to
talk
over
all
that
they
had
heard
they
had
inquired
as
to
the
strange
telegram
that
had
been
received
and
learned
the
true
contents
of
it
they
knew
now
that
it
was
of
kathleen
death
not
her
marriage
they
had
been
informed
she
must
have
arrived
here
on
an
earlier
train
than
chainey
so
she
was
evidently
running
away
from
home
said
carew
and
she
added
i
think
that
wicked
susette
eavesdropped
and
blabbed
my
intentions
to
her
mistress
it
is
very
likely
said
alpine
dejectedly
she
was
sitting
with
her
pale
cheek
in
her
hand
thinking
of
the
dead
girl
whom
she
had
been
taught
to
hate
and
envy
the
latter
had
come
easy
enough
the
former
was
a
lesson
not
so
easily
learned
she
wished
now
in
her
sudden
accession
of
remorse
that
she
had
let
herself
love
winsome
kathleen
whom
it
was
so
hard
to
hate
an
exquisite
casket
had
been
ordered
in
which
kathleen
was
now
resting
easily
like
one
asleep
although
she
had
been
two
days
dead
there
was
no
sign
of
change
about
her
beautiful
and
fair
as
a
flawless
pearl
lay
kathleen
in
her
last
sleep
immediately
after
the
inquest
we
will
remove
the
body
to
boston
for
burial
carew
had
said
in
her
haughty
manner
to
doctor
churchman
as
the
night
advanced
the
whole
family
retired
to
rest
it
was
not
deemed
necessary
to
sit
up
with
the
corpse
she
was
left
alone
in
the
open
coffin
the
lid
being
placed
on
a
table
not
until
after
the
inquest
would
it
be
fastened
down
on
the
murdered
girl
alpine
belmont
tossed
restlessly
upon
her
couch
by
the
side
of
her
sleeping
mother
she
could
not
rest
this
girl
whose
conscience
had
at
last
awakened
she
was
haunted
by
the
ghosts
of
her
evil
deeds
the
cruelties
she
had
shown
her
little
if
she
had
not
run
away
she
would
not
have
come
to
this
but
we
drove
her
to
it
it
was
my
mother
sin
and
mine
she
thought
fearfully
for
the
crimson
marks
on
kathleen
throat
the
wounds
on
her
ears
and
fingers
had
thrilled
her
with
horror
she
was
not
usually
romantic
this
girl
but
kathleen
horrible
fate
had
terribly
unnerved
her
a
strange
impulse
came
to
her
to
go
down
alone
to
the
parlor
to
stand
by
that
open
coffin
and
beg
kathleen
to
forgive
her
all
the
wicked
past
she
will
hear
me
for
the
spiritualists
tell
us
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
remain
at
first
near
their
unburied
bodies
she
thought
superstitiously
and
obeying
her
impulse
rose
slipped
on
a
and
drawn
by
an
awful
and
irresistible
yearning
sought
the
presence
of
the
dead
it
was
but
a
few
moments
more
before
the
whole
household
was
aroused
by
piercing
shrieks
they
rushed
to
the
parlor
and
found
alpine
screaming
beside
an
kathleen
carew
had
disappeared
as
mysteriously
as
if
her
body
had
followed
her
soul
to
heaven
the
gray
light
of
dawn
was
stealing
in
through
the
windows
and
by
that
light
they
saw
some
withered
roses
lying
on
the
floor
last
night
they
had
lain
on
kathleen
breast
the
hall
door
stood
wide
open
and
a
terrible
suspicion
came
into
doctor
churchman
mind
the
beautiful
corpse
had
been
stolen
by
unscrupulous
parties
either
for
the
purpose
of
a
ransom
from
rich
relations
or
for
the
horrible
uses
of
a
medical
college
i
could
not
sleep
so
i
came
down
here
to
look
at
her
again
and
she
was
gone
sobbed
alpine
in
hysterical
dismay
searchers
were
organized
in
haste
but
no
clew
was
found
and
when
ralph
chainey
came
it
was
to
be
confronted
with
this
mysterious
case
he
almost
went
wild
with
agony
he
employed
the
cleverest
detectives
unavailingly
carew
grew
tired
of
the
search
gave
it
up
and
went
back
to
boston
congratulating
herself
in
secret
that
she
would
not
be
at
the
expense
and
trouble
of
a
funeral
for
her
hated
following
fast
upon
this
event
came
the
news
of
the
loss
at
sea
being
burned
to
the
water
edge
with
all
on
board
soon
after
a
cablegram
from
a
london
lawyer
made
the
widow
acquainted
with
the
fact
of
her
husband
recent
will
under
whose
provisions
all
vincent
carew
wealth
was
divided
between
his
wife
and
her
daughter
disinheriting
kathleen
for
her
disobedience
and
making
no
mention
of
his
prodigal
whom
he
had
cordially
despised
alpine
was
delighted
with
her
good
fortune
and
her
mercurial
temperament
began
to
recover
itself
from
the
shock
it
had
sustained
in
kathleen
loss
chapter
xiv
a
strange
fate
i
never
thought
that
i
should
see
thine
eyelids
shut
in
death
thy
bright
brow
cold
thy
spirit
quenched
that

and
bloomed
beneath
sumner
lincoln
fairfield
poor
kathleen
she
had
passed
through
a
strange
and
terrible
experience
on
that
night
when
she
had
been
so
suddenly
choked
and
robbed
by
an
unseen
foe
the
young
girl
had
swooned
from
terror
that
quick
relapse
into
unconsciousness
had
saved
her
life
thinking
her
dead
the
murderer
had
relaxed
his
hold
on
her
throat
and
throwing
her
roughly
from
him
escaped
with
his
booty
in
time
to
board
the
other
train
kathleen
by
one
of
those
strange
psychological
conditions
sometimes
induced
by
severe
mental
strain
or
shock
passed
from
her
swoon
into
a
state
of
coma
or
trance
through
the
two
nights
and
one
day
in
which
she
lay
thus
her
senses
seemed
to
be
preternaturally
acute
although
her
bodily
faculties
were
bound
in
iron
bands
of
inaction
what
was
her
agony
during
the
two
hours
when
she
lay
alone
in
the
murky
darkness
and
the
snow
and
rain
what
her
joy
when
the
voice
of
her
beloved
penetrated
her
senses
saved
saved
and
by
how
she
longed
to
speak
to
utter
aloud
her
joy
and
relief
but
she
could
not
voice
her
gladness
she
could
only
lie
passive
and
inert
and
hear
him
proclaim
her
dead
in
a
voice
of
the
bitterest
despair
oh
the
blended
rapture
and
agony
of
those
hours
to
lie
still
like
a
stone
mute
moveless
and
hear
voice
breathing
his
love
for
her
feel
his
kisses
on
her
cold
face
and
hands
she
longed
with
a
terrible
yearning
to
move
to
stir
beneath
his
touch
to
cry
out
to
him
that
she
was
alive
that
she
loved
him
even
as
he
loved
her
but
her
body
seemed
to
be
as
entirely
dead
as
her
soul
was
alive
alive
and
in
agony
she
knew
that
strangers
came
and
went
that
they
talked
of
her
as
dead
that
they
spoke
of
her
beauty
in
pitying
admiration
that
they
shuddered
at
the
red
on
her
throat
the
wounds
on
her
hands
and
ears
where
her
jewels
had
been
torn
away
she
felt
tears
fall
often
on
her
cold
white
face
she
heard
them
talk
of
an
inquest
on
the
morrow
and
wonder
if
her
relations
from
boston
would
soon
arrive
then
came
the
moment
when
ralph
chainey
had
to
tear
himself
away
from
her
she
heard
gentle
churchman
talking
to
him
about
her
and
saying
that
she
was
not
changed
in
the
least
she
was
a
very
corpse
it
seemed
to
the
girl
as
if
her
heart
leaped
wildly
enough
to
stir
the
flowers
on
her
breast
at
that
awful
word
a
corpse
that
was
what
they
called
her
when
she
was
so
full
of
agonized
life
why
could
they
not
see
that
she
was
not
dead
they
said
she
was
unchanged
why
did
they
not
suspect
the
truth
that
she
was
in
a
trance
not
dead
then
the
doctor
wife
went
out
and
left
ralph
chainey
alone
with
the
lovely
corpse
then
it
was
he
kissed
her
brow
and
hands
and
his
tears
fell
on
her
face
she
heard
him
utter
words
of
love
and
of
farewell
she
knew
that
he
took
a
flower
from
under
her
hand
and
went
away
and
then
she
realized
that
the
man
she
loved
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
had
gone
away
and
left
her
to
her
fate
no
one
else
would
greatly
care
if
she
were
dead
or
living
perhaps
they
would
bury
her
alive
at
this
stage
of
thought
kathleen
seemed
to
die
indeed
her
acute
consciousness
of
everything
became
mercifully
suspended
she
did
not
know
who
came
or
went
she
did
not
know
when
she
was
placed
in
the
elegant
casket
with
its
silver
plate
bearing
her
name
she
did
not
know
when
the
two
women
her
and
came
and
looked
at
her
in
her
pallid
silent
beauty
all
was
a
merciful
blank
then
the
lamp
was
turned
down
to
a
weak
glimmer
and
they
left
her
alone
until
the
morrow
carew
went
upstairs
to
be
with
her
secret
silent
exultation
alpine
with
her
keen
stinging
remorse
the
hours
crept
on
toward
midnight
and
if
any
one
had
been
there
to
notice
they
would
have
seen
a
marked
change
on
the
face
of
the
girl
in
the
coffin
the
complexion
had
lost
its
deadly
pallor
and
become
more
in
its
hue
the
breast
was
faintly
heaving
the
beautiful
veil
of
long
curling
black
lashes
was
fluttering
faintly
against
the
cheeks
suddenly
the
black
lashes
rolled
upward
a
pair
of
large
glorious
dark
eyes
were
revealed
in
them
was
for
a
moment
the
blankness
of
one
rousing
from
a
deep
sleep
then
kathleen
weakly
lifted
her
hands
and
as
they
dropped
at
her
sides
they
touched
the
cold
metallic
edges
of
the
casket
a
low
inarticulate
cry
came
from
her
lips
and
she
rose
upright
staring
about
her
with
bewildered
eyes
she
comprehended
that
she
was
about
to
be
buried
alive
nothing
returned
to
her
yet
of
the
past
everything
merged
itself
into
one
startling
consciousness
of
utter
horror
and
with
a
blind
instinct
of
fear
struggling
in
her
dazed
mind
kathleen
climbed
down
out
of
the
casket
that
stood
on
long
trestles
and
escaped
from
the
house
doctor
churchman
was
attending
a
patient
in
the
neighborhood
and
the
front
hall
door
was
unlocked
kathleen
tore
it
open
with
a
shaking
hand
and
ran
out
into
the
street
a
white
flood
of
moonlight
shone
down
upon
the
sleeping
town
but
no
one
noticed
the
black
clad
figure
bareheaded
with
white
flowers
falling
from
its
breast
running
along
with
feet
toward
the
open
highway
until
out
of
sight
of
the
glimmering
white
houses
just
as
kathleen
emerged
into
the
open
country
she
saw
lights
flashing
in
the
gloom
and
several
men
who
seemed
to
be
searching
for
something
or
some
one
she
shrunk
back
in
alarm
but
she
was
too
late
they
had
seen
her
and
came
toward
her
with
eager
shouts
and
made
her
a
prisoner
it
is
she
exclaimed
one
see
she
answers
the
description
exactly
young
pretty
dark
eyes
light
hair
and
a
black
silk
dress
i
do
not
know
you
what
do
you
want
with
me
wailed
kathleen
wringing
her
little
white
hands
piteously
but
they
did
not
answer
her
they
dragged
her
away
from
the
spot
and
placed
her
in
a
waiting
carriage
then
they
drove
away
and
one
of
them
said
significantly
she
is
so
exhausted
by
her
long
tramp
that
she
will
not
be
violent
and
we
shall
get
her
back
to
the
asylum
without
any
trouble
kathleen
did
not
notice
what
they
said
she
was
so
dazed
and
frightened
by
her
troubles
that
her
memory
was
almost
gone
she
put
her
white
hands
to
her
brow
and
tried
to
recall
her
wandering
thoughts
to
remember
her
name
and
why
she
was
here
but
she
could
not
do
it
everything
was
cloudy
and
vague
with
a
helpless
fluttering
sigh
she
resigned
herself
to
her
strange
fate
and
crouched
shiveringly
into
the
corner
of
the
carriage
that
lumbered
along
the
country
road
a
good
seven
miles
before
it
came
to
a
standstill
before
a
large
gloomy
building
it
was
a
lunatic
asylum
and
hapless
kathleen
had
rushed
upon
a
strange
fate
a
handsome
young
woman
who
had
gone
mad
over
the
treachery
of
a
false
lover
was
being
conveyed
to
the
asylum
and
had
cunningly
eluded
her
keepers
and
escaped
into
the
woods
a
reward
was
offered
for
her
apprehension
and
a
large
number
of
men
had
formed
themselves
into
searching
parties
as
none
of
them
had
seen
her
and
she
answered
perfectly
to
the
description
one
of
these
parties
had
taken
kathleen
into
custody
at
the
asylum
it
was
the
same
way
no
one
had
seen
her
so
the
captive
was
accepted
without
any
doubts
as
to
her
identity
her
hatless
condition
and
dazed
manners
keeping
up
the
illusion
of
her
insanity
the
men
received
their
reward
and
went
away
never
doubting
that
they
had
found
the
right
girl
kathleen
was
put
to
bed
in
a
small
cell
by
a
kind
but
illiterate
attendant
and
still
dazed
and
dumb
with
horror
sunk
into
a
deep
sleep
food
had
been
offered
her
and
she
had
eaten
a
very
little
then
pushed
it
away
with
a
repellant
gesture
after
that
she
was
left
alone
and
slept
wearily
for
long
hours
awaking
refreshed
and
in
her
right
mind
she
could
remember
everything
now
her
flight
from
home
her
journey
that
had
been
interrupted
by
her
terrible
experience
of
robbery
and
attempted
murder
then
the
long
trance
her
terrified
revival
in
her
coffin
and
the
frenzied
flight
into
the
darkness
of
the
chilly
night
all
flashed
over
her
mind
in
the
first
walking
moment
and
she
wondered
why
those
strange
men
had
captured
and
brought
her
here
to
this
strange
place
and
what
a
miserable
little
room
and
bed
not
one
quarter
as
good
as
susette
she
murmured
with
a
glance
of
disdain
around
her
at
the
tiny
cell
alas
she
soon
became
aware
of
the
painful
fact
that
she
was
an
inmate
of
an
asylum
for
the
insane
was
believed
to
be
insane
herself
and
was
called
by
the
name
of
daisy
lynn
in
vain
did
kathleen
eagerly
assure
the
attendants
and
every
one
else
that
would
listen
to
her
tale
of
woe
that
there
was
a
dreadful
mistake
that
she
was
not
the
girl
they
thought
her
but
kathleen
carew
of
boston
they
listened
to
her
with
significant
smiles
and
said
to
each
other
in
her
wanderings
she
has
heard
about
that
poor
murdered
girl
and
now
assumes
her
identity
chapter
xv
poor
daisy
lynn
do
not
ask
me
why
i
love
him
love
cause
is
to
love
unknown
faithless
as
the
past
has
proved
him
once
his
heart
appeared
mine
own
letitia
landon
spring
summer
and
autumn
glided
past
and
still
kathleen
carew
remained
an
inmate
of
the
asylum
at
first
she
had
been
frantic
over
her
strange
fate
and
her
wild
entreaties
for
freedom
had
been
set
down
to
real
lunacy
the
stupid
attendant
paid
no
heed
to
her
ravings
and
only
laughed
when
she
claimed
to
be
kathleen
carew
the
beautiful
young
girl
whose
murder
at
lincoln
station
had
so
stirred
up
the
whole
country
they
were
stupid
and
did
not
read
the
papers
or
they
might
have
seen
the
strange
story
of
her
disappearance
might
have
suspected
that
she
was
speaking
the
truth
so
the
weary
months
went
on
and
when
kathleen
after
her
first
wild
ravings
against
her
fate
had
given
up
at
last
to
a
sort
of
sullen
despair
something
happened
in
her
favor
the
matron
startled
and
alarmed
by
the
appearance
of
the
young
girl
felt
her
heart
stirred
to
pity
and
wrote
to
her
friends
miss
lynn
is
no
longer
a
raving
maniac
as
at
first
she
has
become
silent
and
melancholy
and
looks
so
worn
and
ill
that
i
fear
she
is
slowly
dying
of
a
broken
heart
i
think
you
ought
to
take
her
home
again
and
see
what
home
associations
will
do
toward
prolonging
her
life
she
will
never
be
troublesome
or
violent
again
the
physician
assures
me
of
that
indeed
the
state
she
has
fallen
into
is
one
that
often
precedes
speedy
death
and
the
poor
child
ought
to
have
home
comforts
and
petting
now
that
she
is
so
very
near
the
end
the
matron
who
had
always
pitied
and
admired
the
beautiful
unhappy
young
girl
watched
over
her
tenderly
while
she
waited
for
the
answer
to
come
to
this
merciful
letter
she
was
startled
at
the
delicacy
of
the
young
girl
form
that
had
been
so
graceful
and
rounded
when
she
first
came
and
the
pallor
of
her
face
and
hands
the
great
oriental
dark
eyes
had
become
wild
and
startled
like
those
of
a
haunted
fawn
and
her
voice
when
she
spoke
was
low
and
tremulous
and
had
the
sound
of
tears
in
its
music
when
the
matron
gazed
at
this
sweet
and
lovely
young
girl
she
marveled
that
any
man
heart
could
have
been
cold
and
harsh
enough
to
turn
against
such
charms
and
leave
that
young
heart
to
die
of
despair
or
madden
with
its
cruel
wrongs
she
is
beautiful
and
refined
enough
for
a
king
bride
the
matron
said
with
an
angry
thought
of
the
monster
in
man
likeness
who
had
brought
the
young
girl
to
this
pass
she
waited
eagerly
for
a
letter
to
come
from
miss
watts
the
aunt
hoping
and
praying
that
she
would
take
her
away
and
not
leave
her
to
die
at
the
asylum
tears
came
into
her
kind
old
eyes
as
she
thought
of
herself
robing
this
beautiful
form
for
the
grave
and
folding
those
waxen
white
hands
on
the
weary
breast
for
the
last
long
sleep
she
did
not
tell
kathleen
she
had
written
to
her
aunt
to
take
her
away
because
she
feared
the
effect
of
a
disappointment
she
waited
silently
and
at
last
the
letter
came
miss
watts
was
an
old
woman
a
soured
old
maid
who
had
not
much
patience
with
love
and
lovers
and
who
had
been
much
disgusted
with
her
niece
for
losing
her
senses
over
a
perfidy
she
was
blind
and
her
pretty
niece
had
been
eyes
and
hands
to
her
before
her
trouble
now
she
had
to
depend
on
servants
entirely
and
she
was
crosser
than
ever
she
grumbled
very
much
at
the
idea
of
her
niece
return
a
nice
place
this
will
be
me
blind
and
daisy
insane
she
grumbled
but
the
thought
of
the
young
girl
fading
so
fast
in
the
asylum
touched
her
and
she
had
her
maid
to
write
that
the
girl
might
come
home
if
they
were
quite
quite
sure
she
was
harmless
and
would
not
make
any
trouble
so
hoover
the
matron
came
herself
to
bring
kathleen
home
to
her
aunt
for
she
wanted
to
explain
to
the
old
lady
the
young
girl
strange
fancy
that
she
was
not
daisy
lynn
at
all
but
kathleen
carew
a
beautiful
young
boston
heiress
who
had
been
mysteriously
murdered
in
the
vicinity
of
the
asylum
and
of
whom
the
poor
lunatic
had
chanced
to
hear
in
her
wanderings
so
kathleen
came
into
her
new
home
an
utter
stranger
but
was
received
as
belonging
to
it
the
servants
were
new
and
the
old
lady
was
blind
she
could
not
see
the
face
of
her
niece
and
she
attributed
the
strange
tone
of
her
voice
to
her
illness
she
passed
her
long
delicate
fingers
carefully
over
kathleen
face
and
exclaimed
in
surprise
at
its
delicacy
of
outline
kathleen
overwhelmed
hoover
with
kisses
and
thanks
and
called
her
her
benefactress
for
securing
her
release
from
the
asylum
i
should
have
died
or
gone
mad
in
reality
if
i
had
been
kept
there
much
longer
but
now
i
shall
go
away
from
here
and
find
my
friends
she
said
hopefully
hoover
looked
very
much
alarmed
at
this
declaration
my
dear
if
i
had
thought
you
would
run
away
i
would
not
have
brought
you
here
she
exclaimed
uneasily
but
dear
madame
i
have
no
claim
on
this
old
lady
here
and
i
must
think
of
my
poor
father
who
has
returned
from
europe
ere
this
i
know
and
is
mourning
me
as
dead
obstinately
answered
the
pale
young
girl
whose
heart
throbbed
wildly
at
the
thought
of
returning
to
her
home
and
friends
the
good
old
matron
seized
the
wasted
little
white
hand
of
the
girl
and
patted
it
tenderly
in
hers
as
she
said
remonstratingly
now
listen
to
me
daisy
dear
if
you
run
away
from
home
your
aunt
will
have
you
followed
and
brought
back
to
the
asylum
and
you
know
you
would
not
like
that
would
you
i
would
rather
die
sobbed
the
poor
girl
trembling
like
an
aspen
leaf
then
take
my
advice
and
do
do
anything
rash
dear
child
now
here
a
good
idea
stay
quietly
here
and
write
to
your
friends
to
come
to
you
here
said
the
matron
who
thought
that
this
would
pacify
kathleen
a
while
but
i
wrote
to
them
from
the
asylum
i
wrote
and
wrote
and
wrote
all
in
vain
sighed
the
girl
perhaps
your
folks
were
out
of
town
i
would
try
again
soothed
the
matron
who
knew
that
none
of
those
pathetic
letters
had
ever
gone
outside
the
asylum
i
will
write
again
said
kathleen
patiently
for
the
matron
hints
had
sorely
frightened
her
she
did
not
want
to
run
away
and
be
captured
and
taken
back
to
her
terrible
prison
she
resolved
to
write
again
then
if
no
answer
came
she
must
dare
her
fate
let
her
but
get
safely
home
and
all
would
be
explained
and
her
pursuers
would
have
to
go
away
baffled
how
angry
papa
will
be
when
he
finds
out
what
horrors
his
little
girl
has
endured
she
thought
with
burning
tears
so
hoover
went
away
sadly
believing
that
she
should
never
see
the
poor
sweet
child
again
she
looked
so
wan
and
pallid
as
if
she
already
had
one
foot
in
the
grave
then
kathleen
who
was
left
to
herself
almost
all
the
time
went
back
to
poor
daisy
lynn
room
and
began
to
write
to
all
her
friends
by
night
she
had
quite
a
pile
of
letters
to
post
she
had
written
to
her
father
to
helen
fox
to
alpine
belmont
to
several
of
her
girl
friends
to
ralph
chainey
and
even
to
teddy
darrell
who
had
loved
her
and
asked
her
to
marry
him
despite
his
flirting
propensities
teddy
was
a
prime
favorite
with
every
one
because
of
his
warm
heart
and
good
nature
if
any
one
asked
teddy
darrell
to
do
a
favor
he
would
go
through
fire
and
water
to
accomplish
it
helen
fox
was
accustomed
to
say
laughingly
that
teddy
darrell
would
try
to
flirt
with
a
if
he
only
saw
a
dress
on
it
but
beyond
this
weakness
which
the
girls
easily
forgave
he
was
a
thoroughly
good
fellow
with
a
good
figure
handsome
face
and
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
that
always
laughed
their
owner
into
your
good
graces
some
of
them
will
get
my
letters
surely
and
come
for
me
she
thought
as
she
started
out
to
post
her
letters
her
aunt
sent
a
servant
to
post
them
and
ordered
her
back
reba
will
always
do
your
errands
for
you
she
said
and
kathleen
had
to
relinquish
them
reluctantly
to
the
maid
reba
had
her
instructions
and
while
kathleen
watched
her
from
the
window
she
cleverly
pushed
some
scraps
of
papers
into
the
on
the
corner
and
carried
the
letters
back
to
miss
watts
who
locked
them
into
her
private
desk
it
is
strange
what
a
fad
she
has
taken
into
her
head
she
thought
carelessly
kathleen
waited
with
burning
impatience
for
the
answers
to
come
to
her
letters
she
counted
the
hours
it
would
take
for
them
to
go
from
philadelphia
to
boston
meanwhile
almost
unconsciously
to
herself
she
began
to
take
an
interest
in
the
absent
girl
whose
place
she
had
taken
in
the
asylum
and
in
this
small
neat
home
so
different
from
the
splendor
to
which
she
had
always
been
accustomed
the
little
room
she
occupied
although
not
luxurious
and
grand
like
her
own
in
her
father
mansion
on
commonwealth
avenue
was
a
perfect
bower
of
maidenly
innocence
and
sweet
loving
fancies
the
windows
were
curtained
with
white
lace
looped
with
rosy
ribbons
the
brass
bedstead
had
a
white
lace
canopy
the
the
lounge
the
low
chairs
all
repeated
the
pretty
fashion
of
white
lace
and
ribbons
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
carpet
strewn
with
ferns
pretty
little
pictures
adorned
the
mantel
and
the
walls
and
the
daintiest
kind
of
a
was
displayed
on
the
in
the
drawers
were
girlish
trifles
such
as
young
girls
gather
about
them
and
there
was
too
a
pretty
little
diary
at
which
kathleen
glanced
with
tender
interest
wondering
what
was
written
on
those
pages
penned
by
the
hand
of
a
fair
young
girl
who
had
gone
mad
for
love
but
it
would
not
be
right
to
read
it
she
said
at
first
and
would
not
touch
it
until
her
loneliness
added
to
her
interest
in
poor
missing
daisy
lynn
decided
her
that
it
would
be
no
harm
to
read
the
diary
she
opened
it
and
a
man
photograph
fell
out
into
her
hands
she
gazed
at
it
with
eager
curiosity
exclaiming
this
must
be
the
false
wretch
that
drove
poor
daisy
lynn
to
madness
suddenly
the
girl
face
already
so
pale
and
wan
whitened
to
an
ashen
hue
her
great
dark
eyes
dilated
in
a
sort
of
horror
and
she
flung
the
photograph
far
from
her
into
a
distant
corner
exclaiming
indignantly
ivan
belmont
my
hateful
son
whom
she
wanted
me
to
marry
so
that
i
might
endow
him
with
a
fortune
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
command
her
nerves
sufficiently
to
read
daisy
lynn
diary
and
then
her
tears
fell
freely
for
the
story
of
the
young
girl
love
was
all
written
there
gay
and
joyous
at
first
then
sad
and
plaintive
then
drifting
into
deep
despair
followed
by
the
disjointed
ravings
of
a
mind
distraught
oh
how
sweet
and
then
how
sad
exclaimed
kathleen
love
comes
to
all
young
girls
with
the
same
symptoms
i
suppose
for
i
felt
just
as
she
wrote
in
the
first
after
meeting
ralph
chainey
so
gay
so
glad
so
joyous
the
sky
seemed
brighter
the
flowers
sweeter
the
whole
world
was
a
new
place
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
as
sweet
as
love
chapter
xvi
kathleen
desperation
and
her
escape
and
then
she
sang
a
song
that
made
the
start
she
sang
of
home
sweet
home
the
song
that
reached
my
heart
kathleen
sighed
restlessly
as
she
turned
the
pages
with
her
little
white
hands
love
is
sweet
but
oh
how
sad
it
is
too
she
sighed
oh
how
cruel
it
is
to
love
and
be
beloved
again
yet
be
severed
from
love
by
so
strange
and
cruel
a
fate
as
mine
she
read
aloud
in
a
soft
murmuring
voice
like
sweetest
music
some
verses
from
daisy
lynn
book
it
is
the
spirit
bitterest
pain
to
love
and
be
beloved
again
and
yet
between
a
gulf
that
ever
the
hearts
that
burn
to
meet
must
sever
with
me
the
hope
of
life
is
gone
the
sun
of
joy
is
set
one
wish
my
heart
still
dwells
upon
the
wish
it
could
forget
i
would
forget
that
look
that
tone
my
heart
has
all
too
dearly
known
but
who
could
ever
yet
efface
from
memory
love
enduring
trace
all
may
revolt
all
my
complain
but
who
is
there
may
break
the
chain
poor
daisy
lynn
how
could
she
love
ivan
belmont
like
that
exclaimed
kathleen
in
disgust
forgetting
that
he
a
rather
handsome
man
and
that
tastes
differ
a
longing
to
see
what
daisy
lynn
looked
like
came
over
her
and
she
searched
the
room
in
vain
for
her
picture
then
she
went
down
and
asked
miss
watts
if
she
might
see
her
photograph
the
old
blind
lady
looked
up
with
gentle
displeasure
daisy
child
have
you
no
memory
of
the
past
she
exclaimed
you
know
very
well
that
in
all
your
life
i
have
never
allowed
you
to
have
your
picture
taken
but
why
not
asked
kathleen
in
wonder
because
it
is
a
sin
replied
the
old
lady
who
was
rigidly
religious
have
you
forgotten
she
continued
the
second
commandment
that
you
used
to
read
every
lord
day
at
and
she
repeated
solemnly
shalt
not
make
unto
thyself
any
graven
image
nor
the
likeness
of
anything
that
is
in
heaven
above
or
in
the
earth
beneath
or
in
the
waters
under
the
earth
thou
shalt
not
bow
down
to
them
nor
worship
them
kathleen
stared
in
amazement
at
this
liberal
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
and
retired
regretting
that
she
could
not
have
the
sad
pleasure
of
gazing
on
the
features
of
the
unfortunate
girl
in
whose
fate
her
own
was
so
strangely
bound
up
poor
poor
daisy
lynn
i
wonder
what
became
of
her
when
she
escaped
her
keeper
and
wandered
abroad
that
cold
dark
night
she
mused
and
she
thought
that
the
girl
must
be
dead
and
at
rest
from
her
sorrows
a
long
week
of
waiting
elapsed
but
no
answer
came
to
letters
kathleen
grew
desperate
with
suspense
and
trouble
she
could
no
longer
while
away
the
dreary
winter
days
by
reading
poor
daisy
lynn
novels
or
playing
sad
melodies
on
her
pretty
little
piano
she
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
little
room
for
long
hours
revolving
plans
for
escape
from
miss
watts
the
three
servants
whom
the
old
lady
employed
guarded
the
young
girl
by
the
order
of
their
mistress
as
jealously
as
if
she
had
been
a
convict
in
a
penitentiary
all
the
doors
were
locked
and
guarded
by
burglar
chains
she
had
appealed
to
their
mercy
in
vain
and
she
was
and
had
nothing
with
which
to
bribe
them
they
had
been
told
she
was
melancholy
mad
and
saw
no
reason
to
doubt
the
story
her
sad
white
face
her
beautiful
dark
eyes
in
which
the
tears
so
often
gathered
and
her
mournful
little
songs
all
lent
color
to
the
charge
desperate
emergencies
require
desperate
remedies
kathleen
decided
in
spite
of
hoover
warnings
to
run
away
she
had
no
money
but
that
did
not
deter
her
from
her
purpose
she
would
beg
in
the
street
for
money
to
go
to
boston
before
she
would
remain
here
any
longer
she
told
herself
with
a
burst
of
tears
her
old
fear
of
her
had
died
out
in
the
conviction
that
her
father
had
of
course
returned
home
ere
now
and
that
under
his
protection
no
harm
could
befall
his
beloved
child
from
the
curtained
alcove
where
daisy
lynn
soft
white
sheets
and
blankets
and
counterpanes
were
stored
on
shelves
kathleen
brought
the
sheets
and
tore
them
into
strips
working
on
them
every
night
until
she
had
succeeded
in
making
a
strong
plaited
rope
with
which
to
let
herself
down
from
the
window
heaven
help
me
dear
heaven
help
me
she
prayed
all
the
while
and
one
dark
night
toward
midnight
she
fastened
the
rope
to
the
shutter
hinge
and
let
herself
safely
down
to
the
street
stunned
by
the
velocity
of
her
descent
and
with
bleeding
hands
rasped
by
the
rough
rope
kathleen
fell
upon
the
ground
and
lay
there
pantingly
a
few
moments
free
at
last
thank
heaven
free
she
murmured
gladly
and
wrapping
her
long
circular
cloak
around
her
and
drawing
the
warm
hood
close
about
her
beautiful
face
she
ran
breathlessly
along
flashed
around
a
corner
and
had
left
her
prison
behind
her
fleeing
as
she
hoped
to
home
and
happiness
it
was
growing
late
and
in
the
quiet
city
of
philadelphia
there
were
few
pedestrians
abroad
and
those
mostly
men
in
any
other
city
of
that
size
kathleen
with
her
beautiful
face
would
have
been
insulted
over
and
over
but
the
quaker
city
of
brotherly
love
had
in
it
a
smaller
ruffianly
element
than
the
others
when
she
stopped
and
appealed
to
those
she
met
she
invariably
received
a
coin
instead
of
a
leer
but
they
were
so
small
so
small
and
oh
it
would
take
so
much
money
to
get
to
boston
she
had
stopped
a
policeman
on
his
beat
and
asked
him
timidly
how
much
money
it
would
take
to
get
to
boston
oh
as
much
as
twenty
dollars
i
guess
he
replied
and
at
his
curious
stare
she
thanked
him
and
ran
away
pausing
under
a
street
lamp
to
count
her
money
only
two
dollars
and
twenty
cents
i
shall
never
never
get
enough
she
sighed
and
then
she
gave
a
shriek
a
thief
had
snatched
the
money
from
her
little
white
hand
and
run
down
a
side
street
kathleen
started
to
run
after
him
but
there
was
no
policeman
in
sight
and
the
thief
had
quite
disappeared
she
ran
till
her
limbs
trembled
with
weariness
and
suddenly
emerged
into
walnut
street
people
were
coming
out
of
the
walnut
street
theater
and
crowding
the
pavement
she
saw
a
handsome
man
handing
a
fair
young
girl
to
her
carriage
and
the
sight
awoke
memories
of
the
past
when
she
kathleen
carew
heiress
then
to
a
million
now
a
beggar
in
the
streets
had
been
handed
to
her
carriage
by
ralph
chainey
the
handsome
young
actor
who
had
whispered
in
her
ear
i
hope
we
shall
meet
again
a
dry
sob
rose
in
her
throat
but
she
choked
it
back
and
advancing
till
she
was
in
the
midst
of
the
throng
paused
suddenly
and
began
to
sing
in
a
low
but
thrilling
voice
that
favorite
old
song
home
sweet
home
at
the
same
time
holding
out
her
tiny
white
hand
for
largess
it
was
a
desperate
deed
but
poor
kathleen
was
a
desperate
girl
and
knew
little
more
of
the
evil
of
the
world
than
a
little
baby
she
was
so
eager
to
get
money
to
go
home
and
she
thought
that
out
of
this
great
crowd
there
might
be
many
who
would
pay
her
for
singing
the
simple
little
song
that
everybody
loved
so
well
home
sweet
home
the
song
that
reached
my
heart
chapter
xvii
will
you
be
my
own
sweet
wife
kathleen
love
thee
so
well
so
tenderly
loved
adored
by
me
fame
fortune
wealth
and
happiness
are
worthless
without
thee
kathleen
had
a
sweet
and
voice
that
had
held
crowded
entranced
in
the
happier
days
that
now
seemed
so
far
away
as
that
exquisite
voice
timid
at
first
and
faltering
but
gradually
gaining
strength
and
volume
rose
upon
the
night
air
the
young
girl
was
at
once
surrounded
by
a
wondering
and
admiring
throng
her
desperate
courage
began
to
give
way
as
she
saw
herself
hemmed
in
by
the
crowd
and
the
impulse
seized
her
to
fly
but
she
beat
it
bravely
back
for
already
silver
coins
began
to
rain
into
the
small
white
outstretched
hand
that
seemed
so
ridiculously
dainty
and
aristocratic
for
a
street
beggar
jove
what
a
regular
beauty
one
man
whispered
to
another
as
he
gazed
eagerly
into
the
sweet
face
she
heard
him
and
her
voice
shook
with
indignation
but
she
kept
on
holding
fast
meanwhile
to
her
earnings
determined
that
no
bold
thief
should
capture
them
this
time
suddenly
she
became
aware
that
the
crowd
attention
was
being
diverted
from
her
and
resolved
to
escape
at
this
auspicious
moment
the
fact
was
that
the
popular
actor
ralph
chainey
who
had
just
carried
staid
philadelphia
by
storm
in
his
popular
impersonation
of
prince
karl
was
just
leaving
the
theater
for
his
hotel
and
almost
every
one
turned
away
from
the
beautiful
singer
for
a
glimpse
of
the
tall
dark
handsome
young
fellow
with
his
swinging
stride
as
he
came
among
them
he
on
his
part
had
been
standing
back
a
little
arrested
like
the
others
by
that
sweet
sad
thrilling
song
as
it
neared
the
end
he
pressed
forward
to
make
a
generous
contribution
to
pay
for
his
share
in
the
rare
entertainment
the
crowd
fell
back
and
made
way
for
him
and
kathleen
dreaming
not
of
the
nearness
of
the
lover
who
haunted
all
her
thoughts
started
to
fly
ralph
chainey
had
not
yet
seen
her
face
but
he
hurried
in
pursuit
of
the
slight
cloaked
figure
generously
anxious
that
she
should
not
lose
the
money
he
was
going
to
bestow
on
her
for
the
song
the
crowd
began
to
disperse
and
kathleen
unconscious
of
pursuit
ran
half
a
square
then
slackened
her
pace
so
it
was
that
ralph
chainey
caught
up
with
her
and
laid
a
strong
detaining
hand
upon
her
arm
with
a
low
moan
of
terror
kathleen
raised
her
beautiful
frightened
dark
eyes
to
the
face
of
her
assailant
for
a
moment
they
gazed
into
each
other
eyes
to
both
it
seemed
like
the
shock
of
a
that
sudden
and
to
the
man
it
was
more
startling
then
to
the
girl
for
he
had
long
sorrowed
over
the
fate
of
kathleen
carew
believing
her
dead
yet
here
stood
this
slight
girl
whose
voice
had
so
thrilled
him
a
few
minutes
ago
gazing
at
him
with
kathleen
carew
eyes
looking
out
of
kathleen
carew
face
was
she
ghost
or
human
was
she
a
phantom
of
his
brain
this
slight
pale
girl
he
had
thought
of
her
so
often
he
had
mourned
her
so
passionately
that
perhaps
his
brain
was
distraught
perhaps
the
vision
was
the
figment
of
a
mind
diseased
but
suddenly
the
moan
died
away
on
the
sweet
red
lips
the
hunted
look
faded
from
the
somber
dark
eyes
and
was
succeeded
by
a
look
of
joy
as
she
faltered
ralph
chainey
his
hand
had
slipped
from
her
arm
in
the
first
shock
of
recognition
now
he
hastily
put
it
back
and
pressed
it
to
see
if
it
was
real
flesh
and
blood
or
only
a
phantom
woman
he
muttered
hoarsely
kathleen
carew
are
you
ghost
or
human
kathleen
laughed
radiantly
into
his
i
am
human
chainey
as
i
think
you
ought
to
realize
from
the
way
you
pinching
my
arm
she
returned
with
pretty
archness
all
in
a
moment
she
had
changed
from
a
sad
persecuted
young
girl
begging
her
way
in
the
dark
street
to
a
very
queen
of
love
and
happiness
looking
into
his
luminous
brown
eyes
all
her
sorrow
seemed
to
flee
away
and
the
sunlit
sky
of
love
seemed
glowing
over
her
head
instead
of
dark
wintery
skies
her
archness
her
smiles
and
the
warm
human
touch
of
her
wrist
recalled
him
from
his
ghostly
fears
and
he
said
faintly
but
eagerly
i
can
hardly
believe
my
senses
kathleen
you
alive
after
all
these
months
when
i
sorrowed
for
you
dead
where
have
you
been
her
face
paled
and
she
looked
apprehensively
over
her
shoulder
i
i
can
not
tell
you
here
she
faltered
i
might
be
missed
and
followed
if
if
you
would
only
take
me
to
the
depot
and
send
me
home
to
boston
to
papa
i
will
be
so
grateful
i
i
think
i
have
enough
money
to
pay
my
way
ralph
chainey
signaled
a
passing
cab
and
lifted
the
young
girl
gently
into
it
drive
slowly
about
the
streets
for
an
hour
until
further
orders
he
said
to
the
driver
as
he
sprung
in
and
took
his
seat
by
kathleen
oh
what
happiness
this
is
to
find
you
alive
kathleen
he
exclaimed
searching
for
her
little
hand
and
holding
it
warmly
clasped
in
his
she
nestled
slightly
toward
him
and
he
thrilled
with
happiness
at
the
confiding
motion
you
will
send
me
home
to
papa
she
repeated
sweetly
then
he
said
it
will
be
several
hours
before
the
next
train
for
boston
leaves
kathleen
so
you
can
tell
me
all
about
yourself
while
we
ride
about
and
beguile
the
time
of
waiting
or
would
you
prefer
to
go
to
a
hotel
and
rest
and
have
some
refreshments
i
am
not
hungry
nor
tired
and
prefer
to
ride
about
with
you
this
way
answered
the
girl
with
naïve
simplicity
and
he
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
he
was
young
but
more
worldly
wise
than
kathleen
he
preferred
not
to
take
her
to
a
hotel
until
she
had
some
claim
on
him
to
silence
carping
tongues
but
first
he
must
know
the
secret
of
her
mysterious
whereabouts
ever
since
the
night
when
he
had
kissed
and
wept
over
her
beautiful
dead
face
and
gone
away
on
a
mission
that
brooked
no
delay
but
for
a
few
minutes
he
was
silent
from
sheer
happiness
alive
his
beautiful
kathleen
whom
he
had
adored
in
secret
but
never
told
of
his
love
what
happiness
when
he
and
happiness
had
so
long
been
strangers
her
tremulous
voice
broke
the
silence
do
you
understand
it
all
that
i
was
in
a
trance
that
night
when
you
bade
me
farewell
and
went
away
my
god
a
trance
yes
you
look
natural
churchman
remarked
upon
it
before
she
left
me
alone
with
you
i
heard
what
she
said
kathleen
answered
shuddering
and
ralph
chainey
put
his
arm
about
her
and
drew
her
closer
murmuring
did
you
hear
what
i
said
too
my
bonnie
kathleen
yes
she
answered
trembling
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
and
feeling
warm
blushes
redden
her
cheeks
as
she
whispered
you
kissed
me
you
wept
over
me
you
said
said
that
you
loved
me
and
you
sweet
kathleen
were
you
vexed
at
me
for
my
presumption
questioned
the
young
man
drawing
her
closer
with
a
fond
but
reverent
arm
no
oh
no
faltered
the
girl
shyly
yet
blissfully
and
you
will
let
me
tell
you
the
same
thing
over
darling
kathleen
that
i
worship
you
and
you
will
promise
me
dear
to
be
my
own
sweet
wife
yes
is
it
not
my
own
one
there
do
not
draw
away
from
me
in
fear
one
kiss
my
own
love
my
beautiful
treasure
given
back
to
me
from
the
grave
itself
then
one
kiss
became
a
dozen
he
pressed
her
close
to
his
heart
and
she
rested
there
with
a
blissful
sigh
happy
in
this
haven
of
rest
presently
now
darling
you
may
tell
me
all
your
story
then
i
have
a
startling
proposition
to
make
to
you
he
said
from
what
she
had
said
to
him
about
taking
her
home
to
her
father
he
perceived
that
she
was
entirely
ignorant
of
all
that
had
transpired
since
her
supposed
death
she
was
mercifully
ignorant
of
her
father
loss
at
sea
and
the
will
made
in
london
just
before
he
sailed
disinheriting
his
only
daughter
and
giving
her
portion
of
his
wealth
to
alpine
belmont
poor
little
kathleen
who
believed
that
she
had
still
a
loving
father
and
was
the
heiress
to
all
his
wealth
was
in
reality
orphaned
and
penniless
a
beggar
in
reality
but
ralph
chainey
in
the
greatness
of
his
noble
heart
decided
to
spare
her
the
pain
of
knowing
all
this
yet
and
he
could
see
but
one
way
out
of
the
difficulty
one
very
agreeable
to
himself
and
not
unkind
to
the
lovely
waif
so
strangely
thrown
on
his
protecting
care
he
knew
well
that
the
selfish
belmonts
would
refuse
to
care
for
the
homeless
girl
would
deny
her
identity
refuse
to
admit
her
claims
on
them
he
determined
to
propose
an
immediate
marriage
to
kathleen
by
which
her
future
could
be
made
secure
chapter
xviii
kathleen
disappearance
ay
call
her
on
the
barren
moor
and
call
her
on
the
hill
is
nothing
but
the
heron
cry
and
plover
answer
shrill
kathleen
told
her
lover
between
sobs
and
tears
while
she
rested
close
in
the
shelter
of
his
loving
arms
all
her
sad
story
ralph
chainey
listened
with
bated
breath
his
eyes
dim
with
moisture
to
the
story
of
kathleen
persecutions
what
stupid
people
they
must
have
been
at
the
asylum
not
to
listen
to
your
strange
story
i
will
have
them
indicted
for
unlawfully
detaining
you
he
exclaimed
indignantly
never
mind
that
as
they
can
never
find
me
again
she
replied
happily
they
could
not
take
you
if
they
did
he
answered
and
then
he
unfolded
to
her
gently
and
tenderly
his
wish
to
make
her
his
wife
at
once
and
asked
her
if
she
would
consent
it
is
the
most
proper
thing
for
us
to
marry
at
once
he
said
unfortunately
we
can
not
be
married
in
philadelphia
without
a
license
which
as
it
is
near
midnight
now
i
could
not
procure
until
but
we
can
take
a
train
within
the
hour
for
washington
and
be
married
without
the
necessity
of
a
license
by
the
first
minister
we
can
wake
up
there
do
you
think
you
can
agree
to
this
darling
she
hesitated
she
said
anxiously
had
we
not
better
go
straight
to
boston
and
ask
papa
leave
perhaps
he
would
not
like
it
if
we
were
married
without
his
consent
why
did
he
not
tell
her
the
truth
that
there
was
no
use
in
going
to
boston
that
her
father
was
dead
and
she
had
no
home
there
that
her
and
her
selfish
daughter
had
inherited
the
carew
millions
he
could
not
bear
to
inflict
this
shock
upon
her
so
soon
she
had
suffered
so
much
already
poor
little
darling
that
he
would
save
her
this
added
blow
for
a
little
while
he
could
fancy
how
hard
she
would
take
it
to
come
back
to
the
world
fatherless
penniless
homeless
let
him
make
her
his
wife
first
and
she
would
have
love
wealth
and
position
almost
equal
to
what
she
had
lost
then
he
would
have
the
right
to
comfort
her
with
his
devotion
so
he
began
to
urge
his
suit
with
all
a
lover
devotion
picturing
to
her
the
possibility
of
her
father
refusal
you
are
so
young
dear
kathleen
he
might
want
us
to
wait
years
and
years
and
there
are
so
many
things
that
might
come
between
our
love
he
urged
anxiously
she
shuddered
and
thought
of
alpine
belmont
cruelty
the
remembrance
decided
her
she
consented
to
his
wish
they
were
driven
to
the
station
to
take
the
train
for
washington
in
about
three
hours
we
shall
be
there
and
then
you
shall
soon
be
my
little
wife
he
whispered
joyfully
they
learned
that
the
train
was
more
than
an
hour
late
they
went
into
the
to
wait
then
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
the
members
of
his
company
at
the
hotel
would
be
so
alarmed
at
his
that
night
that
they
would
think
he
had
been
foully
dealt
with
and
raise
a
great
hue
and
cry
he
hastened
to
explain
these
facts
to
his
lovely
girlish
do
you
think
you
would
mind
staying
alone
here
long
enough
for
me
to
go
and
excuse
myself
to
them
he
inquired
tenderly
her
throat
ached
with
the
impulse
to
sob
out
to
him
that
she
was
frightened
that
she
did
not
wish
for
him
to
leave
her
there
alone
but
she
was
ashamed
of
her
weakness
she
would
not
confess
it
to
her
bright
handsome
lover
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
and
with
a
sad
little
smile
on
her
quivering
red
lips
she
bade
him
go
it
is
only
for
a
little
while
my
own
little
love
he
whispered
but
her
heart
sunk
heavily
with
fear
and
dread
he
found
her
a
secluded
seat
in
a
dim
corner
you
can
sit
here
quietly
and
unobserved
until
i
return
he
said
and
stole
a
parting
kiss
from
the
sweet
red
lips
that
smiled
at
him
with
such
pathetic
love
then
he
was
gone
and
she
no
longer
tried
to
check
her
bursting
sobs
leaning
far
back
in
the
corner
her
little
cobwebby
handkerchief
was
soon
drenched
with
her
raining
tears
she
told
herself
that
he
would
soon
return
and
laugh
at
her
for
being
such
a
great
baby
but
she
could
not
help
it
a
terrible
presentiment
of
coming
evil
weighed
down
her
spirits
ralph
chainey
entered
a
cab
and
was
driven
rapidly
to
his
hotel
he
explained
that
business
of
great
importance
called
him
in
haste
to
washington
but
that
he
would
return
the
next
day
in
time
for
the
evening
performance
beau
brummel
then
he
drove
as
fast
as
possible
back
to
the
depot
where
his
little
darling
as
he
called
her
in
his
fond
thoughts
was
impatiently
awaiting
his
return
my
little
darling
so
soon
to
be
my
adored
wife
he
murmured
as
he
hurried
eagerly
into
the
where
the
second
great
shock
of
his
life
awaited
him
kathleen
carew
was
gone
he
stared
with
dazed
eyes
at
the
empty
seat
where
he
had
left
his
beautiful
young
sweetheart
less
than
an
hour
ago
she
was
gone
then
commenced
a
frantic
search
that
lasted
so
long
that
by
and
by
the
train
that
was
to
have
taken
the
pair
to
washington
thundered
into
the
station
and
away
again
while
he
still
pursued
his
unavailing
quest

ralph
chainey
is
a
married
man
sigh
no
more
ladies
sigh
no
more
men
were
deceivers
ever
one
foot
on
sea
and
one
on
shore
to
one
thing
constant
never
when
ralph
chainey
had
led
kathleen
into
the
of
the
depot
he
had
been
so
absorbed
in
her
that
he
failed
to
notice
any
one
around
him
so
he
did
not
observe
a
pretty
and
blonde
beauty
who
was
walking
restlessly
up
and
down
the
room
evidently
bent
on
attracting
attention
to
herself
and
her
dress
by
these
maneuvers
when
ralph
entered
with
kathleen
the
young
woman
gave
him
a
curious
glance
that
speedily
changed
to
one
of
dismay
then
she
shrunk
back
hurriedly
into
the
shadow
and
watched
the
pair
with
bright
eyes
that
glittered
with
the
light
of
hate
a
love
affair
she
muttered
angrily
and
noted
keenly
every
movement
of
the
two
she
saw
how
they
looked
at
each
other
with
the
light
of
love
in
their
beautiful
eyes
she
stole
nearer
and
overheard
their
words
she
saw
their
kiss
their
tender
parting
her
white
hands
clinched
themselves
tightly
her
face
paled
beneath
its
rouge
and
she
muttered
indistinctly
to
herself
muttered
words
of
hate
and
menace
when
ralph
chainey
had
left
kathleen
alone
the
stranger
boldly
approached
the
weeping
girl
standing
before
kathleen
she
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
and
when
kathleen
shrunk
back
and
lifted
her
white
face
in
piteous
fear
and
entreaty
the
stranger
almost
started
at
its
wonderful
beauty
ralph
chainey
is
deceiving
you
was
the
startling
sentence
that
fell
on
kathleen
ear
oh
the
girl
exclaimed
in
bewilderment
but
the
blonde
beauty
went
on
he
has
promised
to
marry
you
but
he
does
not
mean
it
you
poor
pretty
child
it
is
only
a
plot
to
betray
you
you
speak
falsely
kathleen
managed
to
stammer
in
a
choking
voice
her
dark
eyes
flashing
indignantly
you
do
not
want
to
believe
it
i
know
but
i
can
prove
to
you
that
i
speak
the
truth
ralph
chainey
is
a
married
man
am
his
wife
kathleen
grew
as
pale
as
she
had
been
in
her
coffin
that
terrible
night
her
dark
eyes
stared
as
if
fascinated
into
the
pretty
painted
face
of
the
woman
she
could
not
speak
her
head
seemed
to
be
going
round
and
round
her
poor
heart
throbbed
as
if
it
would
break
perhaps
you
have
heard
that
actors
are
wicked
people
continued
the
pretty
stranger
it
is
true
of
the
whole
class
and
most
especially
of
this
ralph
chainey
he
is
always
seeking
for
a
new
love
and
leaving
some
other
woman
to
break
her
heart
for
love
of
him
although
i
am
his
wife
he
tired
of
me
months
ago
and
left
me
to
starve
or
die
of
a
broken
heart
he
cared
not
which
so
that
he
was
well
rid
of
me
my
kind
parents
took
me
home
and
since
then
i
have
watched
his
career
in
amazement
and
despair
many
and
many
a
fair
and
innocent
young
girl
i
have
saved
from
his
clutches
oh
heaven
must
i
believe
this
came
in
a
low
sobbing
from
kathleen
pale
lips
you
are
the
youngest
and
fairest
of
them
all
and
it
would
break
my
heart
to
see
you
fall
into
ralph
chainey
power
continued
the
blonde
anxiously
be
warned
in
time
my
poor
girl
fly
from
this
spot
and
go
home
to
your
friends
i
have
no
friends
in
this
city
and
my
home
is
in
boston
sobbed
kathleen
clasping
her
little
hands
in
despair
then
come
home
with
me
and
stay
all
night
and
you
can
go
on
to
boston
morning
early
was
the
quick
reply
she
waited
for
an
answer
but
none
came
kathleen
head
had
drooped
on
her
breast
a
fatal
unconsciousness
had
stolen
over
her
and
the
hour
of
her
enemy
triumph
was
at
hand
the
blonde
beauty
laughed
low
and
maliciously
as
she
realized
how
deeply
her
words
had
struck
their
poisoned
arrows
into
the
young
heart
coolly
signaling
a
stranger
who
had
hurriedly
entered
the
almost
deserted
she
said
my
friend
has
fainted
from
grief
at
receiving
a
telegram
containing
news
of
the
death
of
her
lover
will
you
assist
me
to
carry
her
out
to
my
carriage
before
she
revives
i
know
she
will
go
into
hysterics
as
soon
as
she
recovers
and
that
would
be
so
embarrassing
in
this
public
place
the
gentleman
a
man
of
about
thirty
years
courteously
acceded
to
her
request
and
gazed
with
deep
compassion
at
the
beautiful
face
of
the
unconscious
girl
he
was
carrying
in
his
arms
what
a
lovely
creature
and
so
young
scarcely
more
than
a
child
yet
she
had
a
lover
and
he
is
dead
he
thought
pityingly
as
he
placed
her
in
the
carriage
i
thank
you
for
your
kindness
said
the
blonde
beauty
with
a
dazzling
smile
the
carriage
door
closed
upon
her
after
she
had
said
home
to
the
driver
and
then
samuel
hall
the
young
man
stood
under
the
gazing
after
them
with
dazed
blue
eyes
quite
an
adventure
sammy
was
it
not
eh
he
muttered
talking
naïvely
to
himself
perhaps
his
arms
thrilled
yet
with
the
pressure
of
the
beautiful
form
that
had
lain
heavily
in
them
a
minute
ago
his
mild
blue
eyes
looked
soft
and
dreamy
how
lovely
she
was
he
mused
so
lovely
and
so
the
other
one
was
handsome
too
in
her
way
but
not
like
the
younger
grand
rich
people
i
suppose
he
ended
with
a
sigh
for
having
once
known
better
days
our
friend
sammy
did
not
very
much
enjoy
his
position
as
a
clerk
in
one
of
philadelphia
immense
emporiums
he
went
home
to
his
lonely
room
in
a
great
rambling
and
though
he
was
not
usually
impressionable
his
mind
kept
running
on
his
little
adventure
he
said
to
himself
that
it
was
because
he
was
so
sorry
for
the
beautiful
young
girl
who
had
fainted
when
she
received
the
telegram
that
her
lover
was
dead
i
wonder
what
their
names
were
he
mused
curiously
the
blonde
i
did
not
quite
like
there
was
something
theatrical
and
about
her
she
did
not
in
the
least
resemble
the
fainting
one
so
they
could
not
be
sisters
still
musing
on
his
little
adventure
he
retired
sleep
came
to
him
made
restless
by
uncanny
dreams
it
seemed
to
the
young
man
that
he
was
standing
on
the
verge
of
a
precipice
looking
down
into
a
dark
gulf
where
a
turbulent
river
rushed
along
in
foam
and
fury
struggling
in
the
gloomy
waves
was
the
young
girl
he
had
carried
fainting
to
her
carriage
and
her
white
face
was
upturned
to
him
her
great
piteous
dark
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
with
unutterable
reproach
tossing
her
white
arms
up
toward
him
she
cried
bitterly
helped
that
wicked
woman
to
destroy
me
then
she
sunk
beneath
the
waves
and
they
closed
forever
over
her
white
face
and
shining
hair
sammy
hall
awoke
in
anguish
his
forehead
beaded
with
perspiration
oh
what
a
strange
weird
dream
how
vivid
it
is
still
in
my
mind
what
does
it
mean
is
it
a
warning
that
can
not
be
however
for
i
was
doing
her
a
kindness
not
an
injury
and
my
heart
ached
with
sympathy
for
her
sorrow
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
next
day
and
at
noon
when
a
heavy
storm
came
up
and
kept
customers
from
crowding
into
haines
great
store
he
told
the
bright
pretty
young
salesladies
about
it
dream
and
all
they
listened
to
him
with
the
liveliest
interest
their
eyes
grew
dim
with
pity
for
the
beautiful
young
girl
whose
heart
had
broken
for
the
death
of
her
lover
but
it
was
so
strange
for
her
to
reproach
me
in
that
dream
he
said
in
a
troubled
voice
so
strange
because
you
see
i
was
only
kind
to
her
and
did
nothing
wrong
hall
i
have
a
theory
to
explain
your
dream
cried
tessie
mays
a
romantic
young
girl
and
every
one
turned
to
her
with
interest
as
she
went
on
the
blonde
was
a
bad
wicked
creature
who
frightened
that
pretty
innocent
young
thing
into
a
faint
and
then
carried
her
off
to
some
wretched
fate
spider
and
the
fly
you
know
it
is
very
likely
indeed
chorused
all
those
romantic
young
girls
and
sammy
hall
heart
sunk
like
a
stone
in
his
breast
he
brooded
over
that
night
adventure
and
in
his
sleep
that
strange
dream
kept
recurring
he
feared
that
tessie
mays
was
right
the
blonde
woman
was
a
wicked
creature
who
had
made
him
a
tool
to
help
her
in
her
nefarious
plans
two
days
later
as
he
was
going
along
ninth
street
to
dinner
he
came
suddenly
face
to
face
with
the
blonde
made
up
carefully
and
gaudily
attired
he
stopped
in
front
of
her
and
stammered
oh
ah
miss
madame
excuse
me
but
how
is
that
unhappy
young
girl
why
you
must
be
crazy
i
do
know
you
i
do
know
what
you
mean
get
out
of
my
way
she
pushed
him
roughly
aside
and
had
disappeared
before
he
recovered
from
his
surprise
chapter
xx
kathleen
makes
a
startling
discovery
who
that
feels
what
love
is
here
all
its
falsehood
all
its
pain
would
for
even
elysium
sphere
risk
the
fatal
dream
again
when
kathleen
carew
recovered
consciousness
she
found
herself
on
a
bed
in
a
shabby
garret
with
the
eyes
of
the
blonde
beauty
looking
into
hers
so
you
are
come
to
at
last
i
began
to
think
you
were
dead
child
here
smell
this
and
you
soon
be
better
she
exclaimed
vivaciously
as
she
held
a
bottle
of
camphor
under
kathleen
nose
kathleen
pushed
it
away
like
a
petulant
child
what
am
i
doing
here
she
sobbed
in
a
frightened
voice
this
is
my
home
you
know
i
offered
to
bring
you
here
to
save
you
from
ralph
chainey
that
wicked
actor
oh
my
what
a
scene
there
was
after
you
fainted
he
came
back
and
i
can
tell
you
he
was
frightened
at
finding
there
i
told
him
he
must
go
away
that
i
had
told
you
all
and
you
hated
him
he
tried
to
brazen
it
all
out
at
first
but
presently
he
was
humble
enough
and
i
made
him
carry
you
out
and
put
you
in
my
carriage
then
he
went
away
vowing
he
would
get
you
into
his
power
some
day
kathleen
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
and
cried
appealingly
oh
madame
is
he
really
your
husband
for
the
sake
of
heaven
do
not
tell
me
an
untruth
for
it
is
more
bitter
than
death
to
lose
faith
in
one
lover
alas
if
it
is
so
hard
to
lose
faith
in
a
lover
how
much
worse
to
be
deceived
by
a
husband
cried
the
blonde
pathetically
she
dashed
her
white
hand
across
her
dry
eyes
and
kathleen
caught
the
glitter
of
a
diamond
ring
flashing
like
a
little
sun
in
her
small
pink
ears
there
were
magnificent
diamonds
too
and
kathleen
began
to
watch
them
with
fascinated
eyes
what
a
beautiful
diamond
ring
wo
you
let
me
try
it
on
please
she
asked
humbly
the
blonde
flattered
by
the
admiration
for
her
ring
slipped
it
off
with
some
difficulty
and
allowed
kathleen
to
take
it
in
her
fingers
she
held
it
up
and
gazed
inside
the
gold
circle
reading
aloud
carew
why
i
never
knew
before
that
a
name
was
cut
began
the
woman
then
bit
her
lip
and
checked
herself
abruptly
where
did
you
get
this
ring
asked
kathleen
excitedly
my
husband
gave
it
to
me
and
your
beautiful
they
too
were
gifts
from
my
husband
from
ralph
chainey
of
course
did
i
tell
you
he
was
my
husband
do
you
want
to
see
my
marriage
certificate
holding
out
her
finger
for
the
ring
presently
said
kathleen
sitting
erect
with
a
strange
fire
in
her
eyes
is
this
she
continued
in
a
strange
voice
name
inside
the
ring
of
course
airily
answered
the
blonde
kathleen
slumbrous
eyes
began
to
glow
with
an
angry
light
and
she
exclaimed
passionately
it
is
false
it
is
my
own
name
and
the
ring
is
mine
the
also
are
mine
my
father
gave
them
to
me
you
must
be
crazy
girl
exclaimed
the
blonde
in
honest
surprise
she
snatched
the
ring
and
slipped
it
back
on
her
finger
i
tell
you
i
am
in
earnest
stormed
kathleen
roused
to
a
sudden
fury
by
the
thought
of
her
wrongs
i
tell
you
i
am
kathleen
carew
and
those
jewels
were
stolen
from
me
by
a
man
who
choked
me
and
left
me
for
dead
on
the
ground
while
he
tore
those
gems
from
my
bleeding
hands
and
ears
and
you
say
it
was
your
husband
she
stopped
shuddering
violently

sarah

kathleen
pale
shuddering
startled
gazed
in
horror
at
the
face
of
the
bold
handsome
creature
who
declared
to
her
that
these
gems
for

she
had

that
the
woman
was
ralph
wife
and
that
he
had
given
her
the
jewels
if
so
what
an
awful
vista
of
suspicion
and
crime
opened
back
of
these
two
facts
could
it
be
that
ralph
chainey
was
the
fiend
who
had
robbed
and
murdered
her
that
night
and
then
by
his
clever
acting
thrown
off
suspicion
from
himself
the
terrible
suspicion
made
her
tremble
like
a
leaf
in
the
wind
and
meantime
the
woman
whom
we
will
call
fedora
was
gazing
at
her
with
suspicious
eyes
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
you
girl
she
said
impatiently
come
now
i
want
to
hear
your
story
from
beginning
to
end
kathleen
did
as
she
was
asked
she
related
the
whole
story
of
her
life
from
the
first
meeting
with
ralph
chainey
until
now
fedora
listened
with
eager
attention
she
was
especially
interested
in
belmont
and
her
son
ivan
and
she
wanted
you
to
marry
she
said
yes
but
i
will
never
do
it
i
hate
him
and
so
does
papa
he
is
a
spendthrift
and
dissolute
said
kathleen
quoting
words
that
her
father
had
used
of
his
fedora
frowned
and
said
hastily
but
he
is
very
handsome
is
he
i
believe
some
people
think
so
but
i
do
i
guess
daisy
lynn
thought
so
or
she
would
not
have
gone
mad
for
love
of
him
and
the
whole
story
of
daisy
lynn
came
out
it
proved
very
interesting
indeed
to
the
blonde
who
asked
many
questions
and
seemed
disappointed
that
kathleen
could
not
answer
them
all
when
she
had
elicited
all
that
kathleen
could
tell
she
returned
to
the
subject
of
ralph
chainey
i
knew
he
was
false
to
me
but
i
did
not
believe
he
was
wicked
enough
to
do
murder
she
said
kathleen
shuddered
as
with
a
mortal
chill
and
said
faintly
there
must
be
some
mistake
the
blonde
gazed
in
silence
for
several
minutes
at
the
lovely
face
of
the
hapless
young
girl
then
asked
abruptly
what
shall
you
do
about
it
nothing
kathleen
answered
sorrowfully
and
she
thought
to
herself
that
she
would
give
the
world
to
blot
out
of
her
life
all
memory
of
the
man
she
had
loved
so
dearly
and
so
well
yet
she
knew
that
his
memory
would
haunt
her
all
her
life
long
and
that
her
heart
would
break
because
he
had
proved
unworthy
she
looked
pleadingly
at
the
woman
before
her
and
exclaimed
will
you
please
take
me
home
to
my
father
answered
fedora
soothingly
she
rose
as
she
spoke
lie
down
and
sleep
it
is
late
she
added
i
will
go
home
with
you
and
restore
you
to
your
friends
she
went
out
carefully
locking
the
door
behind
her
alone
in
her
own
room
she
looked
at
the
beautiful
jewels
that
had
cost
kathleen
so
dear
and
muttered
he
did
it
for
me
to
get
these
for
me
how
he
loves
me
but
this
girl
her
life
is
a
menace
to
his
liberty
if
i
let
her
go
home
and
tell
what
she
knows
suspicion
will
fall
upon
why
did
he
bungle
so
if
he
must
do
that
ghastly
job
then
she
laughed
oh
i
have
paid
out
ralph
chainey
chapter

rescued
hame
hame
hame
is
hame
i
fain
wad
be
hame
hame
hame
in
my
ain
countree
sammy
hall
was
bitterly
sorry
that
he
had
missed
getting
any
information
from
the
blonde
about
the
beautiful
girl
he
had
seen
with
her
that
night
at
the
station
the
beautiful
white
face
and
closed
eyes
of
the
young
girl
haunted
him
with
strange
persistency
and
after
his
accidental
on
the
street
with
the
insolent
blonde
he
felt
more
apprehensive
than
ever
i
wish
i
knew
where
she
lived
i
would
find
out
more
about
her
he
thought
and
fell
to
watching
for
the
bright
eyes
and
golden
hair
every
day
he
was
rewarded
for
his
efforts
when
one
day
he
saw
her
at
the
trimming
counter
buying
some
gold
passementerie
from
tessie
mays
sammy
hall
waited
till
she
had
sailed
out
of
the
store
then
went
across
to
the
young
salesgirl
it
that
woman
the
one
that
carried
off
the
girl
that
night
i
saw
her
give
you
her
address
what
is
it
he
queried
excitedly
as
much
excited
as
himself
tessie
gave
it
to
him
and
he
began
to
set
his
wits
to
work
to
find
out
the
mystery
of
that
night
to
kathleen
indignation
and
dismay
fedora
had
kept
her
a
close
prisoner
in
the
shabby
little
garret
chamber
ever
since
that
night
now
five
days
ago
when
she
had
been
brought
there
to
quiet
the
complaints
of
the
girl
fedora
told
her
that
she
dare
not
let
her
go
outside
the
house
because
her
aunt
emissaries
were
searching
for
her
everywhere
and
that
if
found
she
would
be
arrested
and
taken
back
to
the
asylum
you
must
remain
quietly
hidden
here
until
the
search
blows
over
she
said
and
no
entreaties
could
move
her
jailer
heart
there
was
always
a
plausible
excuse
but
kathleen
looking
into
the
flippant
insolent
face
began
to
distrust
the
woman
she
hates
me
hates
me
because
ralph
chainey
said
he
loved
me
she
thought
uneasily
and
she
grew
frightened
in
the
miserable
little
garret
room
in
which
she
was
kept
a
prisoner
seeing
no
one
but
fedora
who
brought
her
food
with
her
own
hands
food
which
tasted
palatable
enough
but
which
seemed
only
to
sap
the
young
girl
strength
for
with
each
day
kathleen
grew
weaker
and
weaker
at
first
she
had
been
wont
to
pace
the
chamber
restlessly
for
hours
now
her
limbs
grew
weary
her
brain
seemed
to
reel
she
rested
in
the
chair
then
upon
the
bed
and
her
burning
brain
was
full
of
the
thought
of
ralph
chainey
treachery
i
loved
him
so
i
loved
him
so
yet
he
was
wicked
false
and
cruel
beyond
all
men
she
sobbed
and
the
knowledge
was
killing
to
her
she
thought
that
now
at
last
she
was
going
mad
like
poor
daisy
lynn
over
a
lover
falsity
she
did
not
know
that
it
was
death
not
madness
that
was
approaching
but
the
food
brought
her
by
fedora
was
drugged
so
that
in
a
short
time
it
must
cause
her
death
if
she
kept
on
taking
it
she
did
not
dream
what
a
terrible
interest
the
woman
had
in
her
death
and
that
she
had
decided
that
kathleen
carew
must
never
go
out
of
that
house
alive
he
did
it
for
and
i
must
not
let
her
go
free
she
decided
grimly
and
went
unfalteringly
about
her
plans
for
ending
that
sweet
innocent
young
life
kathleen
found
her
imprisonment
here
more
galling
than
it
had
been
in
the
home
of
miss
watts
there
was
here
no
pretty
dainty
room
filled
with
a
young
girl
dainty
books
and
pictures
but
only
squalor
such
as
might
have
surrounded
an
uneducated
servant
she
wondered
much
over
the
house
she
was
in
and
if
her
jailer
the
gaudily
attired
blonde
beauty
inhabited
such
a
shabby
apartment
as
she
allotted
to
her
guests
but
she
was
not
likely
to
have
her
curiosity
gratified
on
this
point
as
fedora
always
locked
the
door
on
leaving
and
there
was
only
one
window
a
small
one
very
high
up
that
gave
an
uninteresting
outlook
on
the
walls
of
other
houses
poor
ones
it
seemed
from
their
moldy
bricks
a
day
came
when
fedora
did
not
bring
her
any
dinner
and
the
whole
day
wore
away
dully
and
gloomily
it
was
the
day
when
samuel
hall
saw
her
shopping
in
the
store
of
granville
haines
kathleen
did
not
dream
of
what
had
happened
but
fedora
had
moved
out
of
the
house
that
day
leaving
her
victim
to
her
fate
kathleen
ate
so
little
of
the
drugged
food
prepared
for
her
that
she
had
lived
longer
than
the
woman
anticipated
so
she
decided
to
leave
her
to
starve
to
death
in
the
unoccupied
house
where
she
was
locked
into
the
wretched
garret
when
she
gave
her
address
to
the
pretty
saleslady
at
granville
haines
it
was
in
a
fit
of
that
saved
kathleen
life
instead
of
giving
her
new
address
she
gave
her
old
one
and
as
we
have
seen
samuel
hall
at
once
secured
it
from
tessie
mays
so
excited
was
the
young
man
and
so
fearful
that
harm
had
befallen
the
beautiful
young
girl
of
that
night
adventure
that
he
actually
secured
the
services
of
a
policeman
and
finding
the
house
closed
and
seemingly
unoccupied
the
doors
were
broken
open
and
a
strict
search
instituted
when
they
had
almost
begun
to
despair
of
success
the
beautiful
victim
was
found
by
the
delighted
young
clerk
who
at
once
recognized
her
as
the
fainting
girl
he
had
placed
in
the
carriage
that
night
she
fainted
again
when
she
learned
that
she
was
saved
and
the
policeman
and
sammy
had
some
difficulty
in
restoring
her
to
consciousness
when
they
had
done
so
they
were
filled
with
grief
and
horror
at
the
story
she
had
to
tell
oh
let
me
go
to
papa
she
begged
them
pathetically
and
samuel
hall
melted
by
her
beauty
and
distress
assured
her
that
she
should
be
sent
at
once
to
boston
a
closed
carriage
was
secured
and
sammy
and
the
sympathetic
policeman
escorted
her
to
the
station
where
a
ticket
was
bought
and
kathleen
placed
in
a
pullman
car
god
forever
bless
you
sobbed
the
young
girl
weeping
over
hand
and
overwhelming
him
with
promises
of
what
her
rich
father
would
do
to
reward
him
for
his
nobility
then
the
train
steamed
away
out
of
the
station
and
there
were
tears
in
the
eyes
of
both
men
through
which
they
saw
dimly
the
pale
and
lovely
face
on
which
a
little
hopeful
smile
was
budding
into
bloom
the
policeman
made
sammy
promise
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
the
perfidious
blonde
and
to
let
him
know
if
he
found
her
so
that
she
might
be
arrested
and
punished
for
kidnapping
the
girl
then
the
two
separated
the
policeman
returning
to
his
regular
beat
and
sammy
to
the
store
where
he
told
the
sympathetic
young
girls
the
story
of
his
knightly
deliverance
of
kathleen
and
became
quite
a
hero
in
their
admiring
eyes
but
gladdest
of
all
was
our
beautiful
kathleen
speeding
as
fast
as
steam
could
carry
her
back
to
boston
and
to
papa
who
must
surely
have
come
home
ere
now
and
who
would
be
so
glad
to
see
his
little
girl

carlotta
perry
it
snowed
in
boston
that
night
when
ivan
belmont
came
home
on
his
usual
mission
to
extort
money
by
begging
coaxing
threats
or
curses
he
usually
tried
all
in
succession
before
he
succeeded
from
the
rich
widow
his
mother
and
the
heiress
his
sister
and
he
was
wont
to
say
on
these
occasions
that
he
would
almost
rather
for
the
money
than
to
extort
it
from
those
two
penurious
women
they
were
so
and
quarrelsome
it
was
quite
true
what
he
said
money
he
have
but
he
was
so
spendthrift
and
reckless
that
his
mother
groaned
in
spirit
over
his
excesses
and
often
flatly
refused
him
a
penny
then
he
would
have
recourse
to
alpine
and
he
never
left
until
he
secured
it
although
he
invariably
had
to
raise
a
storm
before
he
succeeded
his
periodical
pirating
visits
grew
to
be
deplored
by
the
whole
household
even
by
the
servants
who
knew
that
the
effects
of
his
demands
were
to
be
dreaded
for
days
in
the
increased
harshness
and
of
the
two
women
they
served
the
contest
had
raged
hotter
than
ever
before
and
only
the
threat
of
criminal
deeds
unless
his
demands
were
met
had
sufficed
to
draw
gold
from
the
pockets
of
his
relatives
chuckling
over
his
success
he
left
the
house
and
prepared
to
face
the
raging
storm
outside
on
his
way
back
to
the
distant
city
whence
he
had
come
crushing
his
hat
down
over
his
face
he
hurried
down
the
marble
steps
pausing
at
the
bottom
in
surprise
at
seeing
the
cloaked
figure
of
a
female
in
the
act
of
ascending
the
steps
the
glare
of
a
shone
full
on
the
scene
curiosity
prompted
him
to
stare
at
the
beautiful
white
face
upraised
timidly
to
his
own
as
he
did
so
his
own
face
whitened
with
horror
his
eyes
dilated
his
limbs
trembled
with
fear
my
god
he
muttered
hoarsely
and
turning
fled
from
the
spot
in
mad
haste
like
one
pursued
by
fiends
he
believed
that
he
had
seen
a
veritable
ghost
for
it
was
the
pale
lovely
face
of
kathleen
carew
into
which
he
had
gazed
so
wildly
kathleen
whom
he
believed
dead
so
he
fled
from
the
spot
as
wildly
as
his
trembling
limbs
would
permit
kathleen
had
always
disliked
and
despised
ivan
belmont
so
she
only
smiled
scornfully
at
his
precipitate
flight
and
began
to
ascend
the
marble
steps
her
heart
beating
with
joy
at
the
thought
of
meeting
her
father
again
i
wonder
if
james
will
be
frightened
too
and
run
away
thinking
me
a
ghost
she
murmured
with
a
sad
little
smile
as
she
rang
the
bell
but
it
was
not
james
who
opened
the
door
to
her
it
was
a
total
stranger
who
stared
in
surprise
at
the
sight
of
a
beautiful
young
girl
out
alone
on
such
a
stormy
night
all
the
old
servants
had
been
discharged
after
kathleen
death
because
they
had
irritated
carew
by
grieving
after
their
young
mistress
so
the
man
looked
in
wonder
at
the
strange
young
girl
with
the
rich
golden
hair
and
flashing
dark
eyes
who
stepped
across
the
threshold
as
if
she
belonged
there
and
said
to
him
with
gentle
imperiousness
tell
your
master
there
is
a
young
lady
to
see
him
without
waiting
for
a
reply
kathleen
brushed
past
the
astonished
servant
entered
a
small
on
her
right
and
sat
down
to
await
the
entrance
of
her
father
she
had
not
mentioned
her
name
because
she
wanted
to
take
him
by
surprise
she
wanted
to
see
the
flash
into
his
handsome
face
when
she
should
throw
herself
into
his
arms
and
cry
out
tenderly
papa
darling
it
is
i
your
little
kathleen
come
home
to
you
again
how
glad
he
would
be
to
see
her
again
he
had
always
loved
her
so
fondly
that
his
heart
must
have
almost
broken
when
they
told
him
she
was
dead
and
how
glad
he
would
be
to
have
her
back
again
how
his
eyes
would
flash
when
she
told
him
how
wretchedly
she
had
been
treated
he
would
certainly
call
in
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
to
punish
her
persecutors
only
she
did
not
want
them
to
do
anything
to
old
hoover
the
kind
matron
who
had
befriended
her
in
the
asylum
she
sunk
down
into
a
beautiful
satin
chair
with
a
sigh
of
relief
at
getting
back
to
papa
and
home
again
her
beautiful
home
so
warm
so
luxurious
filled
with
the
rich
odor
of
flowers
in
strong
contrast
to
the
storm
raging
bleakly
outside
the
somewhat
amazed
at
her
coolness
in
entering
the
but
supposing
her
to
be
some
intimate
friend
of
the
family
went
in
search
of
his
mistress
a
young
lady
is
in
the
small
asking
for
belmont
he
said
he
had
naturally
supposed
that
kathleen
meant
ivan
belmont
as
he
was
the
only
man
connected
with
the
house
did
you
send
belmont
to
her
he
had
just
gone
out
madame
and
she
did
not
wait
for
me
to
tell
her
but
brushed
past
me
and
went
into
the
room
he
replied
impertinent
exclaimed
the
lady
in
angry
surprise
i
will
go
and
see
what
she
wants
she
added
rising
and
throwing
down
her
novel
to
go
she
was
already
in
a
towering
rage
because
she
had
been
bullied
by
ivan
into
giving
him
five
hundred

a
few
minutes
ago
and
the
idea
that
a
woman
one
of
his
low
associates
most
probably
had
had
the
effrontery
to
follow
him
here
added
fuel
to
the
flame
of
her
fury
kathleen
heard
the
swish
of
a
silken
robe
and
the
heavy
curtains
parted
and
fell
behind
the
tall
and
stately
form
of
her
handsome
the
girl
rose
up
grieved
that
it
was
not
her
father
but
so
glad
to
be
safe
at
home
again
that
she
was
almost
glad
to
see
again
the
wicked
woman
who
was
the
cause
of
all
her
trouble
mamma
she
faltered
using
the
name
she
had
been
taught
to
give
her
cruel
and
carew
who
had
been
advancing
angrily
toward
her
recoiled
with
a
smothered
cry
and
starting
eyes
kathleen
came
toward
her
with
eager
imploring
hands
outstretched
in
greeting
do
not
be
frightened
mamma
i
am
not
a
ghost
i
am
human
she
said
sweetly
but
carew
who
had
sunk
down
on
her
knees
in
mortal
terror
waved
her
back
back
back
she
breathed
hoarsely
and
kathleen
saw
that
she
believed
herself
haunted
by
the
spirit
of
her
dead
she
went
back
to
her
seat
and
began
to
explain
her
appearance
in
soothing
tones
it
was
all
a
mistake
mamma
i
was
in
a
trance
not
really
dead
and
i
came
to
myself
in
the
coffin
that
night
and
dazed
and
frightened
lest
they
should
bury
me
alive
i
ran
away
into
the
woods
some
people
caught
me
and
put
me
into
a
lunatic
asylum
from
which
i
have
just
escaped
chapter
xxiv
turned
out
into
the
storm
the
poor
too
often
turn
away
unheard
from
hearts
that
shut
against
them
with
a
sound
that
will
be
heard
in
heaven
longfellow
carew
drew
a
long
sobbing
breath
and
struggled
up
to
a
chair
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
fearfully
on
kathleen
who
went
on
sorrowfully
i
can
not
tell
you
mamma
what
i
have
suffered
since
i
went
away
last
spring
the
recital
would
be
enough
to
melt
a
heart
of
stone
you
never
loved
me
i
know
but
you
would
have
pitied
me
if
you
could
have
known
how
i
was
suffering
from
the
stupidity
of
those
people
who
took
me
for
another
girl
and
kept
me
a
prisoner
so
many
months
thank
heaven
it
is
all
over
now
and
i
am
at
home
again
but
where
is
papa
i
want
to
see
him
so
much
and
i
am
sure
he
can
not
be
out
this
stormy
night
while
the
young
girl
talked
the
color
had
been
coming
back
to
carew
lips
and
a
malevolent
gleam
to
her
blue
eyes
straightening
herself
up
in
her
chair
she
looked
across
at
the
girl
realizing
that
it
was
indeed
kathleen
carew
come
back
from
the
portals
of
death
she
had
always
hated
the
lovely
innocent
girl
and
now
she
thought
triumphantly
that
kathleen
day
was
past
her
father
was
dead
and
she
was
disinherited
she
had
no
part
nor
lot
in
the
home
to
which
she
had
returned
the
cruel
woman
looked
at
the
lovely
young
suppliant
and
sneered
you
can
not
impose
on
me
with
your
false
claims
you
are
not
kathleen
carew
and
your
resemblance
to
her
is
very
slight
not
strong
enough
to
bear
out
your
assertion
my
is
dead
no
no
kathleen
cried
piteously
i
am
your
indeed
i
am
mamma
and
i
have
told
you
the
truth
i
have
been
so
ill
and
unhappy
all
these
months
it
is
that
which
has
changed
my
looks
and
made
me
look
so
unlike
the
kathleen
you
remember
where
is
papa
he
will
know
me
he
will
be
glad
that
i
am
alive
she
made
a
movement
to
leave
the
room
but
as
suddenly
carew
barred
her
way
you
lunatic
you
shall
not
leave
this
room
she
hissed
savagely
kathleen
hot
temper
held
at
bay
so
long
flamed
up
at
once
i
go
to
papa
she
uttered
angrily
and
in
a
low
but
perfectly
clear
voice
her
tormentor
answered
vincent
carew
is
she
saw
the
girl
start
and
tremble
as
if
she
had
been
struck
her
sweet
face
flushed
a
moment
ago
with
anger
went
deathly
white
and
she
clutched
the
back
of
a
chair
for
support
vincent
carew
is
dead
repeated
the
pitiless
woman
before
her
she
heard
a
moan
of
mortal
agony
issue
from
kathleen
pale
lips
but
she
continued
heartlessly
my
husband
was
lost
at
sea
in
the
that
was
burned
to
the
water
edge
the
very
week
after
my
was
murdered
in
pennsylvania
by
his
will
made
in
london
just
before
he
sailed
he
disinherited
his
daughter
for
her
intimacy
with
an
actor
and
left
his
whole
fortune
to
me
and
my
daughter
it
is
monstrous
impossible
you
are
telling
me
a
falsehood
moaned
kathleen
with
difficulty
for
her
senses
were
leaving
her
under
the
shock
of
her
words
a
low
gasp
came
from
her
lips
she
staggered
blindly
forward
then
fell
insensible
upon
the
carpet
carew
spurned
the
senseless
form
with
her
foot
and
threw
wide
the
velvet
calling
jones
lift
this
woman
up
and
put
her
out
into
the
street
and
be
careful
never
to
admit
disreputable
characters
inside
my
doors
again
or
you
may
lose
your
place
the
man
who
had
been
lingering
about
very
near
approached
with
profuse
apologies
and
excuses
carry
her
out
into
the
street
repeated
his
mistress
angrily
jones
took
up
the
light
unconscious
figure
in
his
arms
and
moved
toward
the
door
but
he
muttered
deprecatingly
she
die
out
there
in
the
snow
what
is
that
to
you
creatures
like
ought
to
be
dead
do
as
you
are
bid
or
you
will
rue
it
stormed
his
mistress
and
jones
dazed
and
frightened
by
her
violence
hastened
to
obey
her
commands
the
door
had
hardly
closed
on
him
as
he
bore
poor
kathleen
out
into
the
stormy
night
when
alpine
belmont
disturbed
by
the
noise
came
gliding
down
the
stairs
demanding
the
cause
of
the
excitement
carew
was
pale
and
trembling
in
every
limb
and
she
answered
reluctantly
it
something
not
fit
for
a
young
girl
ears
my
dear
oh
bosh
i
find
out
from
the
servants
if
do
tell
me
retorted
alpine
and
then
carew
said
cunningly
well
if
you
must
know
such
awful
things
a
woman
came
here
demanding
to
see
that
disreputable
brother
of
yours
you
can
imagine
the
sort
of
woman
crazy
with
drink
that
would
follow
so
i
made
jones
put
her
out
into
the
street
and
the
whole
disgraceful
thing
will
be
talked
over
by
the
servants
by
alpine
shivered
with
horror
and
disgust
and
muttered
i
wish
ivan
was
dead
he
is
too
wicked
to
live
the
idea
of
that
woman
effrontery
carew
thought
to
herself
that
was
a
good
idea
of
mine
she
believes
every
word
good
for
i
would
not
like
for
her
to
know
the
truth
she
has
been
so
soft
over
that
girl
ever
since
her
supposed
death
that
there
no
telling
what
pity
would
lead
her
to
do

teddy

again
the
snow
lies
white
and
the
moon
gives
light
i
out
to
the
freezing
mere
and
i
tell
my
mind
to
the
friendly
wind
because
i
have
loved
her
so
ingelow
carew
servant
jones
was
a
very
humane
and
man
and
his
heart
swelled
with
anger
as
he
obeyed
the
command
of
his
mistress
and
bore
the
fainting
young
girl
out
of
the
splendid
abode
of
luxury
and
wealth
into
the
cold
and
stormy
night
he
stopped
under
the
flaring
and
looked
pityingly
into
the
lovely
white
face
that
had
fallen
back
against
his
arm
why
what
a
pretty
young
thing
she
is
little
more
than
a
child
and
looks
as
innocent
too
he
soliloquized
i
bet
my
life
that
if
she
ever
done
any
harm
she
been
betrayed
into
it
by
that
scoundrelly
ivan
belmont
that
she
came
here
to
find
he
ought
to
be
hung
so
he
ought
he
glanced
anxiously
up
and
down
the
almost
deserted
avenue
the
snow
lay
white
and
deep
upon
the
ground
and
the
great
flakes
swirled
through
the
air
striking
him
coldly
in
the
face
if
i
put
her
down
here
on
the
ground
she
will
freeze
to
death
poor
girl
that
certain
he
murmured
uneasily
i
just
ca
do
such
a
wicked
thing
no
not
even
if
she
bad
as
carew
said
why
even
if
she
was
a
murderess
it
would
be
right
to
leave
her
out
here
to
die
in
the
cold
but
land
what
be
i
to
do
with
her
that
what
i
want
to
know
the
whinny
and
stamp
of
an
impatient
horse
attracted
his
attention
at
that
moment
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
a
smart
cab
waiting
at
the
next
door
the
driver
half
asleep
sat
on
his
box
his
head
sunk
into
the
collar
of
his
a
sudden
temptation
came
to
the
troubled
jones
and
he
did
not
fight
against
it
but
rather
welcomed
it
as
an
inspiration
walking
noiselessly
across
the
snow
jones
placed
his
burden
inside
the
cab
upon
the
cushions
and
closed
the
door
so
softly
that
it
did
not
attract
the
attention
of
the
tired
and
sleepy
driver
on
the
box
god
bless
you
and
raise
you
up
a
friend
this
awful
night
you
poor
little
wretch
apostrophized
jones
as
he
returned
from
the
scene
and
the
carew
mansion
he
had
not
been
gone
ten
minutes
before
a
servant
came
from
the
house
before
which
the
cab
was
waiting
and
roused
the
sleepy
cabby
the
lady
as
you
brought
here
has
decided
to
stay
all
night
with
her
sick
mother
so
she
told
me
to
pay
you
and
send
you
away
he
said
all
right
but
i
wish
she
had
made
up
her
mind
afore
she
kep
me
here
all
night
i
be
frozen
with
the
cold
that
what
i
be
grumbled
the
driver
accepting
the
double
fee
ungraciously
and
driving
away
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
all
unconscious
of
the
silent
passenger
inside
he
went
rattling
down
to
a
large
hotel
hoping
he
might
get
a
fare
for
the
theater
a
tall
handsome
young
man
came
down
the
steps
and
hailed
him
take
me
to
the
opera
house
he
said
opening
the
door
and
springing
lightly
in
all
right
sir
and
away
they
went
teddy
darrell
the
new
fare
pulled
up
the
collar
of
his
long
overcoat
about
his
ears
and
was
about
to
settle
himself
comfortably
when
he
received
a
violent
shock
he
discovered
that
he
was
not
alone
in
the
cab
a
slight
girlish
form
shrouded
in
a
heavy
cloak
was
huddled
up
on
the
opposite
seat
and
low
moans
were
issuing
from
its
lips
chapter

i
would
lay
down
my
life
to
serve
you
said
teddy
how
was
any
one
to
know
that
those
eyes
had
looked
just
so
on
a
hundred
other
women
with
a
glance
as
light
and
strange
there
are
men
who
change
their
passions
even
oftener
than
their
fashions
and
the
best
of
loving
always
to
their
minds
is
still
to
change
john
trowbridge
teddy
darrell
had
had
some
adventures
in
his
day
and
was
not
given
to
nerves
so
he
did
not
let
the
shock
of
his
discovery
overcome
him
the
thought
flashed
over
him
that
some
drunken
woman
had
crept
into
the
cab
unknown
to
the
driver
and
fallen
into
a
troubled
slumber
the
flaring
lanterns
on
the
outside
of
the
cab
did
not
afford
much
light
so
teddy
struck
a
match
and
held
it
over
the
face
of
his
unknown
companion
then
indeed
he
had
a
shock
much
greater
than
the
first
one
the
lighted
match
fell
from
his
hand
and
he
recoiled
with
a
startled
cry
good
heavens
what
a
likeness
he
sunk
upon
the
opposite
seat
actually
trembling
with
surprise
and
emotion
in
the
pale
and
lovely
face
lying
unconscious
on
the
cushions
the
young
man
had
recognized
a
haunting
likeness
to
one
he
had
loved
very
dearly
and
whose
tragic
fate
six
months
ago
had
thrilled
him
with
unutterable
horror
although
other
lovers
had
succeeded
kathleen
in
teddy
young
impressionable
heart
he
had
never
ceased
to
regret
the
fact
that
she
had
rejected
him
the
sweetest
loveliest
girl
in
all
the
world
he
had
always
thought
of
bonny
kathleen
and
he
trembled
with
pain
when
he
saw
in
the
poor
street
waif
as
he
believed
her
the
awful
likeness
to
his
lost
loved
one
kathleen
who
was
beginning
to
recover
consciousness
moaned
and
stirred
half
lifting
herself
toward
the
young
man
he
bent
toward
her
kindly
and
said
are
you
ill
madame
that
voice
it
was
one
from
her
happy
past
it
stirred
a
pulse
in
kathleen
heart
and
she
turned
toward
him
wildly
her
dark
eyes
opening
wide
upon
his
anxious
face
the
flaring
lights
from
some
place
of
amusement
shone
into
the
cab
and
showed
her
his
features
teddy
darrell
she
murmured
in
a
feeble
tone
of
amazement
good
heavens
you
know
me
he
exclaimed
who
are
she
held
out
her
white
hands
to
him
with
an
entreating
gesture
do
you
know
me
do
you
remember
kathleen
carew
she
cried
faintly
kathleen
carew
is
he
answered
blankly
no
no
she
lives
it
was
a
mistake
i
was
in
a
trance
and
i
escaped
from
my
coffin
and
ran
away
into
the
woods
whispered
the
girl
rapidly
regaining
the
strength
to
speak
good
heavens
so
that
what
became
of
you
cried
teddy
darrell
he
seized
her
little
white
hands
and
pressed
them
rapturously
welcome
back
to
life
my
dear
girl
he
laughed
happily
and
she
exclaimed
you
know
me
you
believe
me
of
course
i
do
he
replied
joyously
but
how
came
you
to
be
here
in
this
cab
alone
and
unconscious
i
do
not
know
she
answered
in
a
puzzled
voice
i
went
home
and
mamma
told
me
my
father
was
dead
and
that
he
had
disinherited
me
in
his
will
then
she
denied
my
identity
and
the
last
thing
i
remember
i
fell
fainting
on
the
carpet
oh
darrell
will
you
do
me
one
favor
take
me
to
my
dear
friend
helen
fox
helen
fox
is
in
europe
he
replied
reluctantly
in
europe
oh
good
heavens
what
am
i
to
do
then
helen
is
the
only
friend
i
have
to
turn
to
in
my
distress
exclaimed
the
young
girl
clasping
her
beautiful
hands
in
the
keenest
despair
teddy
darrell
looked
at
her
reproachfully
you
seem
to
forget
miss
carew
but
i
would
lay
down
my
life
to
serve
you
he
exclaimed
impetuously
she
glanced
up
and
met
his
eyes
they
wore
the
most
killing
expression
of
devotion
and
teddy
dark
eyes
could
be
very
expressive
when
he
chose
kathleen
blushed
vividly
and
answered
i
i
did
not
know
if
i
might
call
you
my
friend
or
not
some
men
might
not
like
a
young
girl
after
after
she
paused
in
confusion
after
she
rejected
him
finished
teddy
coolly
well
i
hope
i
am
not
as
mean
as
that
miss
carew
i
shall
be
only
too
happy
to
be
your
friend
and
brother
if
you
will
allow
me
you
are
too
good
to
me
she
whispered
gratefully
as
she
held
out
her
little
white
hand
to
him
adding
sadly
friend
in
need
is
a
friend
indeed
and
i
am
poor
in
everything
now
with
not
even
a
shelter
for
my
head
do
say
that
exclaimed
the
sympathetic
young
fellow
with
a
break
in
his
voice
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
my
cousin
one
of
the
kindest
ladies
in
the
world
if
you
will
allow
me
to
do
so
and
pulling
the
he
gave
the
driver
orders
not
to
proceed
to
the
opera
house
but
to
the
street
where
his
cousin
lived
kathleen
acquiesced
gratefully
in
his
decision
her
heart
went
out
warmly
to
this
cordial
friend
and
she
regretted
in
her
heart
that
she
had
ever
laughed

alpine
belmont
all
in
a
flutter
of
surprise
and
delight
was
making
herself
beautiful
with
her
maid
assistance
for
the
eyes
of
a
caller
who
was
waiting
for
her
in
the
ten
minutes
ago
a
card
had
been
brought
to
her
bearing
the
name
of
ralph
chainey
he
asked
for
carew
first
but
i
told
him
she
was
out
then
he
sent
his
card
to
you
said
jones
alpine
heart
leaped
with
wild
delight
she
was
as
romantically
in
love
with
the
gifted
and
handsome
young
actor
as
was
possible
to
one
of
her
vain
and
selfish
nature
after
kathleen
death
she
had
cherished
some
hope
of
winning
him
but
his
coldness
and
indifference
had
been
so
marked
and
his
despair
over
kathleen
loss
so
deep
that
in
angry
pique
she
had
given
up
her
hopes
and
determined
to
console
herself
with
her
newly
acquired
wealth
the
novelty
of
her
position
as
a
great
heiress
had
for
a
time
diverted
her
thoughts
but
of
late
they
had
returned
to
him
again
and
rested
longingly
on
her
desire
to
win
his
heart
so
the
sudden
announcement
of
his
presence
filled
her
with
joyful
anticipations
her
maid
was
hurriedly
summoned
to
array
her
mistress
for
the
coming
interview
in
the
servants
hall
a
little
later
she
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
gentleman
must
be
a
very
particular
beau
as
the
lady
was
so
hard
to
please
meanwhile
alpine
palpitating
in
a
silk
that
set
off
very
becomingly
her
blonde
beauty
was
entering
the
to
meet
her
caller
ralph

incarnation
of
a
romantic
young
girl
idea
of
a
lover
rose
and
bowed
with
courtly
grace
over
miss
belmont
hand
he
had
been
searching
vainly
for
kathleen
more
than
a
week
and
at
last
it
occurred
to
him
that
perhaps
she
had
come
home
he
hastened
to
boston
in
a
fever
of
anxiety
alpine
could
never
remember
afterward
in
what
words
he
told
his
story
it
came
on
her
so
suddenly
it
found
her
so
unprepared
but
presently
she
knew
it
all
knew
that
kathleen
whose
death
had
so
softened
her
heart
was
alive
and
that
but
for
some
strange
happening
of
fate
she
would
that
moment
be
ralph
chainey
beloved
wife
with
that
knowledge
alpine
heart
grew
cold
as
ice
again
the
old
jealous
hate
revived
she
could
not
speak
for
some
moments
but
sat
staring
with
burning
blue
eyes
at
the
unhappy
young
man
who
was
pouring
out
his
whole
heart
oh
miss
belmont
think
what
an
awful
shock
it
was
to
me
losing
her
in
that
mysterious
fashion
i
have
scarcely
eaten
or
slept
since
i
have
been
so
wretched
i
employed
detectives
but
they
seem
to
be
all
at
sea
they
even
believe
that
i
was
mistaken
that
it
was
not
kathleen
carew
at
all
but
really
daisy
lynn
a
lunatic
miss
watts
from
whom
she
had
escaped
had
been
found
and
she
declared
that
the
girl
was
her
niece
a
wild
hope
came
into
alpine
mind
and
she
faltered
i
believe
the
detectives
are
right
kathleen
can
not
be
alive
remember
we
saw
her
in
her
coffin
cold
and
dead
not
dead
for
i
have
seen
her
alive
he
exclaimed
oh
miss
belmont
do
not
discourage
me
do
not
turn
unbelieving
ears
to
my
story
for
i
swear
to
you
that
kathleen
carew
is
alive
alive
but
given
over
to
some
fate
perhaps
worse
than
death
alpine
heart
beat
wildly
as
he
fixed
his
great
burning
brown
eyes
so
sorrowfully
upon
her
face
oh
god
she
thought
what
would
she
not
give
for
ralph
chainey
to
love
her
as
he
did
kathleen
carew
her
hated
some
burning
words
of
the
virginia
poetess
mittie
point
davis
came
into
her
mind
if
your
heart
could
throb
for
me
even
for
a
moment
space
with
the
love
i
feel
for
thee
gazing
on
that
glorious
face
if
the
passion
that
i
feel
found
response
within
your
breast
years
of
anguish
could
not
steal
memories
that
i
had
been
blest
if
those
eyes
so
darkly
glorious
kindled
as
with
mine
they
met
i
could
hold
myself
victorious
even
though
you
did
forget
i
could
give
the
lifelong
passion
of
a
thousand
meaner
souls
for
one
hour
brief
adoration
over
thine
to
sway

ralph
chainey
did
not
dream
what
a
wealth
of
love
for
him
had
blossomed
into
full
flower
in
the
young
girl
heart
men
are
blind
or
they
would
never
confide
to
one
beautiful
young
girl
the
story
of
their
love
for
another
one
few
girls
are
noble
enough
to
listen
without
being
piqued
and
jealous
alpine
belmont
heart
burned
within
her
and
she
said
to
herself
that
she
hoped
he
was
mistaken
and
that
poor
kathleen
was
dead
she
believed
it
herself
and
she
and
her
mother
had
long
ago
agreed
that
kathleen
body
had
been
stolen
from
the
doctor
cottage
for
purposes
of
dissection
she
had
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
that
beautiful
body
being
so
desecrated
but
carew
had
seemed
quite
indifferent
and
congratulated
herself
that
she
had
escaped
the
expenses
of
a
fashionable
funeral
and
a
costly
monument
all
the
sorrow
she
had
felt
for
kathleen
death
died
out
of
heart
as
she
beheld
the
trouble
of
the
handsome
young
actor
and
she
said
to
herself
that
if
kathleen
could
rise
from
the
grave
and
stand
before
her
she
would
be
tempted
to
strike
her
dead
at
her
feet
while
these
cruel
and
jealous
thoughts
ran
through
alpine
mind
ralph
chainey
was
looking
at
her
with
pathetic
eyes
that
mutely
craved
her
sympathy
at
last
she
began
to
understand
this
and
a
clever
idea
came
to
her
why
not
pretend
to
sympathize
with
him
in
his
sorrow
it
would
bring
them
closer
together
and
perhaps
win
her
some
kind
thoughts
from
him
following
out
her
thought
alpine
moved
to
a
seat
beside
the
young
actor
and
laying
her
soft
ringed
white
hand
lightly
upon
his
she
gave
it
a
sympathetic
pressure
and
murmured
no
words
can
tell
you
how
deeply
i
sympathize
with
you
in
your
sorrow
i
hope
for
both
our
sakes
that
your
belief
may
prove
true
and
kathleen
be
restored
to
your
heart
her
sympathy
pleased
him
as
she
knew
it
would
and
he
answered
eagerly
you
loved
her
i
know
how
could
any
one
live
in
the
house
with
her
and
not
be
devoted
to
one
so
sweet
and
lovely
alpine
withdrew
her
hand
and
played
nervously
with
her
many
rings
yes
i
was
fond
of
kathleen
she
murmured
you
did
well
to
come
to
me
you
have
all
my
sympathy
and
oh
how
i
wish
i
could
find
her
and
restore
her
to
you
is
there
nothing
i
can
do
i
am
rich
you
know
and
if
you
wish
it
i
will
employ
a
detective
to
find
kathleen
but
even
as
she
breathed
the
tender
words
the
wily
girl
knew
that
she
would
rather
employ
a
detective
to
hunt
her
rival
down
to
her
death
ralph
chainey
blind
mortal
that
he
was
looked
at
her
gratefully
without
detecting
the
hollow
ring
in
her
voice
god
bless
you
for
your
noble
offer
miss
belmont
but
i
can
not
accept
it
he
replied
i
have
detectives
already
employed
i
too
am
rich
and
my
whole
fortune
shall
be
devoted
to
finding
her
if
it
costs
that
much
all
that
you
can
do
is
to
write
to
me
at
once
if
you
hear
from
our
poor
lost
darling
i
shall
be
moving
from
one
city
to
another
but
i
will
keep
you
informed
of
my
whereabouts
oh
thank
you
chainey
and
i
will
write
you
if
i
have
the
least
bit
of
news
exclaimed
alpine
with
sparkling
eyes
for
she
began
to
see
a
prospect
of
getting
up
a
correspondence
with
the
great
actor
she
would
write
to
him
often
asking
if
had
any
news
and
he
would
be
obliged
in
common
courtesy
to
reply
he
rose
to
go
and
alpine
poured
out
eloquently
her
sympathy
for
him
and
her
sorrow
for
kathleen
we
both
love
her
it
is
a
link
between
us
she
said
try
to
think
of
me
as
a
sister
and
remember
i
shall
often
be
thinking
of
you
in
your
sorrow
he
thanked
her
gratefully
and
hurried
away
after
promising
to
call
again
the
first
time
he
came
to
boston
alpine
told
her
mother
on
her
return
of
the
young
man
visit
and
his
startling
disclosure
but
carew
the
whole
story
kathleen
is
certainly
dead
she
said
ralph
chainey
has
been
imposed
on
by
a
pretty
lunatic
that
all
i
thought
he
had
more

teddy
darrell
kept
his
promise
to
kathleen
he
took
her
immediately
to
the
home
of
his
cousin
a
widow
lady
of
about
years
a
woman
of
good
circumstances
and
social
standing
but
whose
divided
devotion
to
two
pretty
children
and
literary
pursuits
caused
her
to
live
a
very
retired
life
stone
must
have
been
very
fond
of
her
cousin
teddy
for
she
accepted
his
story
of
the
finding
of
kathleen
in
good
faith
and
made
the
young
girl
welcome
to
her
luxurious
home
she
saw
that
the
hapless
girl
was
nearly
fainting
with
fatigue
and
leaving
teddy
alone
in
the
pretty
library
carried
her
off
to
bed
after
first
coaxing
her
to
take
some
tea
and
toast
bless
you
my
dear
your
name
has
been
a
familiar
one
in
this
household
for
more
than
a
year
teddy
was
so
madly
in
love
with
you
once
that
he
could
talk
of
nothing
else
but
kathleen
carew
whenever
he
came
even
the
children
knew
all
about
it
kathleen
blushed
at
receiving
so
much
kindness
from
teddy
cousin
after
having
rejected
so
to
clear
herself
she
said
but
he
got
over
it
directly
helen
fox
told
me
he
proposed
to
her
the
week
afterward
stone
who
was
warming
a
dainty
before
the
fire
for
her
guest
threw
her
head
back
and
laughed
heartily
teddy
darrell
is
the
worst
flirt
in
boston
actually
miss
carew
known
that
boy
to
be
engaged
to
three
girls
at
the
same
time
she
exclaimed
merrily
i
suppose
he
can
never
be
really
in
earnest
said
the
young
girl
then
stone
replied
more
seriously
i
have
never
known
him
to
be
in
earnest
but
once
and
i
have
been
his
confidante
i
believe
in
all
of
his
love
affairs
he
has
had
many
fancies
but
he
never
really
loved
any
one
but
my
dear
girl
kathleen
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
this
and
the
lady
rattled
on
well
teddy
is
a
good
catch
if
i
do
say
it
myself
for
he
is
a
real
good
boy
and
very
rich
his
wife
if
he
ever
gets
one
will
have
a
happy
life
and
i
hope
he
will
soon
marry
for
that
would
cure
him
of
his
little
fads
fads
observed
kathleen
inquiringly
yes
replied
her
new
friend
he
is
full
of
them
some
time
ago
it
was
to
be
an
author
and
i
believe
he
wrote
up
whole
reams
of
foolscap
in
the
six
weeks
while
the
fever
lasted
he
came
here
every
day
bringing
dozens
of
pages
of
the
thrilling
romance
over
which
he
had
been
wasting
the
midnight
oil
finally
he
sent
it
off
to
a
publisher
and
a
prompt
rejection
cooled
his
ardor
now
his
fad
is
to
be
an
actor
an
actor
kathleen
exclaimed
her
thoughts
flew
with
exquisite
pain
to
ralph
chainey
so
beloved
and
so
false
he
has
been
ever
since
he
saw
ralph
chainey
act
last
winter
continued
the
communicative
hostess
he
tells
me
now
that
he
is
studying
to
go
upon
the
stage
but
i
sure
he
will
fail
he
will
certainly
have
i
hope
not
answered
kathleen
and
then
the
gentle
lady
tucked
her
kindly
into
bed
as
if
she
had
been
a
little
child
my
dear
she
said
with
a
kiss
and
then
she
went
away
saying
she
must
go
and
see
teddy
darrell
he
was
waiting
for
her
alone
the
children
who
had
been
amusing
him
had
gone
off
to
bed
and
he
settled
himself
for
a
long
confidential
chat
from
his
talk
she
soon
learned
that
his
love
of
a
year
ago
for
bonny
kathleen
had
revived
with
fuller
intensity
than
ever
cousin
carrie
i
bound
to
marry
that
girl
he
exclaimed
with
sparkling
eyes
but
she
rejected
you
last
winter
teddy
i
know
but
everything
is
different
now
she
was
a
belle
and
heiress
then
now
she
is
poor
and
friendless
but
for
us
when
she
learns
that
i
love
her
in
spite
of
her
changed
position
and
that
i
want
to
marry
her
as
soon
as
she
will
have
me
she
will
be
touched
by
the
romance
of
the
affair
and
now
do
laugh
so
cousin
carrie
it
romantic
is
it
not
my
devotion
certainly
she
agreed
merrily
then
added
but
i
afraid
you
will
find
it
hard
to
convince
her
of
your
devotion
for
she
told
me
when
i
spoke
of
it
just
now
that
you
had
proposed
to
helen
fox
the
very
week
after
she
rejected
you
teddy
made
a
grimace
oh
that
was
all
fun
and
i
think
it
was
very
shabby
in
helen
telling
all
the
other
girls
about
it
of
course
i
only
wanted
the
engagement
for
a
few
weeks
then
to
pique
her
and
get
discarded
as
i
done
with
other
girls
he
said
carelessly
having
a
very
elastic
conscience
in
matters
of
love
but
he
added
rather
lugubriously
but
i
in
earnest
carrie
with
kathleen
carew
positively
she
is
the
only
girl
i
ever
loved
in
my
life
that
is
real
sure
enough
love
and
it
will
break
my
heart
if
i
do
get
her
for
my
wife
you
did
break
your
heart
when
you
believed
that
she
was
dead
his
cousin
reminded
him
cynically
oh
that
different
he
replied
vaguely
i
set
my
heart
on
getting
her
now
and
i
could
never
get
over
it
if
i
failed
look
here
cousin
carrie
leaning
toward
her
his
bright
dark
eyes
full
of
tender
pleading
help
me
wo
you
speak
a
good
word
for
me
to
her
i
not
such
a
bad
sort
am
i
wheedlingly
i
would
make
a
nice
young
girl
a
good
husband
would
i
now
yes
teddy
i
believe
you
would
then
help
me
wo
you
it
not
selfish
in
me
is
it
to
want
to
marry
this
poor
girl
who
has
been
so
strangely
despoiled
of
home
and
fortune
and
make
up
to
her
for
all
her
cruel
loss
he
was
deeply
romantically
in
earnest
and
stone
could
not
help
admiring
his
nobility
no
teddy
it
not
selfish
for
you
a
good
match
and
help
you
with
sweet
kathleen
if
i
can
i
used
to
be
called
a
good
in
other
days
when
i
went
more
into
society
and
i
exert
my
powers
now
for
your
benefit

you
over
and
over

exclaimed
fervently
thus
in

and
the
next
morning
although
she
felt
really
weak
and
ill
she
kept
her
promise
she
wrote
a
kind
and
grateful
letter
to
the
noble
clerk
again
thanking
him
for
his
goodness
to
her
and
telling
him
of
her
terrible
disappointment
on
reaching
home
i
can
not
understand
it
all
i
am
so
dazed
with
my
trouble
she
wrote
but
papa
is
dead
lost
at
sea
and
the
strangest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
he
made
a
will
just
before
he
sailed
for
america
and
disinherited
me
his
only
child
think
of
the
strangeness
the
cruelty
of
it
but
he
is
dead
i
must
not
harbor
unkind
thoughts
of
him
i
am
sure
some
malignant
influence
was
brought
to
bear
but
i
am
homeless
penniless
but
for
this
friend
stone
with
whom
i
am
staying
i
can
not
now
repay
you
the
sum
of
money
you
so
nobly
advanced
me
to
return
home
on
but
i
shall
never
forget
it
and
the
time
may
come
when
i
shall
be
able
to
restore
it
fourfold
till
then
god
bless
you
is
the
prayer
of
your
friend
till
death
kathleen
carew
sammy
hall
was
all
excitement
over
the
letter
and
at
the
first
opportunity
confided
the
news
to
his
sympathetic
girl
friends
of
course
they
talked
it
over
at
that
quietest
hour
in
the
day
when
the
throng
of
shoppers
are
out
at
lunch
or
gone
home
to
dinner
tessie
mays
who
had
the
news
direct
from
sammy
retailed
it
all
to
the
eager
listeners
and
no
one
noticed
a
handsome
showily
dressed
young
woman
who
had
entered
the
store
and
come
up
to
counter
fedora
who
having
given
the
wrong
address
the
other
day
had
now
returned
to
complain
that
she
had
never
received
her
package
of
gold
passementerie
just
as
she
was
approaching
the
counter
she
heard
the
name
of
kathleen
carew
called
and
drawing
back
with
a
great
start
pretended
to
be
examining
some
gorgeous
brocade
silk
that
was
displayed
on
the
end
of
the
counter
the
pretty
animated
young
girls
did
not
observe
her
and
went
on
talking
fedora
did
not
lose
a
word
pretty
soon
she
became
aware
that
her
prey
had
escaped
her
through
the
efforts
of
sammy
hall
and
that
she
was
now
safe
in
boston
with
a
friend
although
her
father
was
dead
and
had
disinherited
her
and
her
had
denied
her
identity
it
is
just
like
a
novel
is
it
commented
one
of
the
young
girls
i
would
give
anything
i
own
for
one
good
look
at
the
beautiful
miss
kathleen
carew
with
the
hair
and
proud
dark
eyes
that
sammy
raves
over
tessie
mays
i
think
you
would
be
jealous
exclaimed
another
girl
with
a
meaning
laugh
tessie
tossed
her
dark
curly
head
carelessly
why
sammy
hall
is
not
my
beau
i
think
it
was
you
dolly
wade
that
he
took
to
church
sunday
night
was
it
it
was
dolly
turn
to
blush
and
bridle
she
laughed
oh
pshaw
hall
only
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
do
think
he
wants
to
marry
you
anyhow
he
is
cut
out
for
an
old
bachelor
if
ever
a
man
was
have
you
ever
seen
that
woman
again
tessie
asked
another
girl
turning
the
conversation
what
woman
why
the
one
that
sammy
recognized
and
is
going
to
arrest
if
she
ever
comes
in
here
again
for
kidnapping
miss
carew
why
no
and
it
strange
too
for
she
made
a
mistake
gave
me
the
address
of
a
vacant
house
and
her
gold
passementerie
came
back
here
i
was
certain
she
would
be
back
here
fussing
about
it
and
i
tell
sammy
it
lucky
she
made
the
mistake
so
she
will
to
come
back
here
he
has
the
warrant
for
her
arrest
and
she
never
get
out
of
haines
without
a
policeman
escort
wo
she
muttered
fedora
with
a
low
gurgling
laugh
of
sarcastic
amusement
she
tripped
away
in
a
hurry
in
spite
of
her
pretended
mirth
and
did
not
breathe
freely
until
she
was
out
of
the
store
and
in
the
cab
that
was
waiting
for
her
near
the
sidewalk
whew
what
a
narrow
escape
she
muttered
so
i
have
been
watched
and
almost
trapped
while
i
believed
myself
triumphant
an
ugly
look
crossed
the
pretty
blonde
face
and
she
continued
angrily
i
wonder
who
sammy
hall
can
be
that
those
girls
talked
about
so
familiarly
he
must
be
the
man
that
helped
me
put
the
girl
in
the
carriage
and
that
i
met
afterward
in
the
street
and
snubbed
so
coolly
he
has
taken
revenge
on
me
by
ferreting
out
the
place
where
i
left
kathleen
carew
and
rescuing
her
from
her
fate
heigho
i
think
i
had
better
leave
for
new
york
right
away
philadelphia
will
be
too
hot
a
place
to
hold
me
for
a
while
if
i
had
the
money
i
would
go
to
boston
and
look
up
my
runaway
bird
and
ivan
at
the
same
time
he
promised
to
send
me
three
hundred
dollars
this
week
he
had
better
do
it
for
got
a
hold
on
him
now
thanks
to
that
girl
disclosure
that
he
shake
off

my
darling
girl
i
as
fond
of
you
as
ever
sweetheart
name
the
day
for
me
when
we
two
shall
wedded
be
make
it
ere
another
moon
while
the
meadows
are
in
tune
edmund
clarence
stedman
you
must
cheer
up
dear
kathleen
and
feel
yourself
quite
at
home
with
me
stone
said
affectionately
to
her
sorrowful
young
guest
kathleen
looked
at
her
wistfully
with
her
sad
dark
eyes
but
i
have
no
claim
on
your
kindness
dear
lady
she
sighed
why
are
you
my
cousin
teddy
friend
and
is
he
one
of
the
best
boys
in
the
world
and
did
i
promise
his
dead
mother
that
i
would
always
be
kind
to
the
boy
she
was
leaving
so
lonely
in
the
wide
world
for
his
father
had
died
years
before
yes
indeed
you
have
a
claim
on
me
not
alone
because
teddy
loves
you
so
passionately
but
for
your
own
dear
sake
because
your
trouble
and
your
helplessness
make
it
my
duty
to
love
and
care
for
you
exclaimed
the
kind
lady
feelingly
you
are
so
good
and
kind
may
heaven
reward
you
sobbed
the
unhappy
girl
she
leaned
her
beautiful
curly
head
on
stone
shoulder
and
wept
bitter
burning
tears
from
the
depths
of
her
overcharged
heart
poor
kathleen
she
was
surely
the
most
unhappy
girl
in
the
world
so
young
so
lovely
and
so
loving
yet
pursued
by
a
cruel
unrelenting
fate
that
had
wrested
from
her
little
hands
all
that
she
held
dearest
in
life
her
young
heart
was
torn
with
agony
for
the
death
of
her
beloved
father
and
the
thought
of
ralph
chainey
sin
added
poignancy
to
her
grief
in
the
long
dark
watches
of
the
sleepless
nights
poor
unhappy
kathleen
lay
wakeful
and
wretched
on
her
pillow
thinking
wildly
of
her
lost
love
the
man
who
had
seemed
like
a
in
her
eyes
so
handsome
and
so
gifted
and
so
noble
but
who
had
been
deceiving
her
all
along
who
had
a
wife
while
he
was
pretending
he
meant
to
marry
her
and
but
when
it
came
to
this
thought
kathleen
hysterical
sobs
almost
choked
her
and
she
said
to
herself
that
she
would
not
permit
herself
to
believe
it
the
thought
that
it
was
ralph
chainey
who
had
robbed
her
that
night
and
given
her
jewels
to
woman
was
unendurable
that
way
lay
madness
but
it
was
no
wonder
that
each
morning
when
the
kind
eyes
of
her
hostess
scanned
her
face
so
anxiously
she
found
it
paler
and
paler
while
the
dark
eyes
were
somber
and
heavy
from
the
tears
that
always
lay
so
near
them
and
the
sweet
red
lips
had
always
a
tremulous
curve
as
if
from
repressed
sobs
stone
kind
heart
ached
for
the
unhappy
young
creature
who
only
wept
at
all
her
attempts
at
comfort
she
said
to
herself
that
she
did
not
believe
there
was
much
chance
for
teddy
darrell
after
all
the
girl
did
not
show
the
least
interest
when
she
spoke
of
her
cousin
her
whole
heart
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
grief
for
her
father
death
and
in
wonder
over
the
fact
that
he
had
been
mysteriously
angry
with
her
and
given
her
share
of
his
wealth
to
her
papa
always
loved
me
and
i
never
did
anything
to
vex
him
so
why
did
he
hate
me
why
did
he
leave
his
poor
kathleen
alone
and
penniless
in
the
cold
world
she
would
sob
piteously
stone
had
no
answer
ready
for
that
inquiry
it
was
a
mystery
to
her
too
why
vincent
carew
had
done
such
a
cruel
and
wicked
thing
she
did
not
know
that
carew
had
brought
about
the
whole
thing
by
her
malicious
cablegram
if
she
had
only
waited
until
that
strange
telegram
from
ralph
chainey
had
been
explained
how
different
kathleen
fate
would
have
been
ill
and
penniless
the
dead
millionaire
beautiful
young
daughter
was
as
poor
and
wretched
as
any
beggar
in
the
streets
only
for
this
kind
friend
cheer
up
my
dear
cheer
up
she
urged
kindly
but
kathleen
could
not
even
bring
a
smile
to
her
poor
stiff
lips
teddy
darrell
came
every
day
to
inquire
after
her
and
he
was
shocked
at
the
change
in
beautiful
kathleen
she
looks
awfully
ill
almost
as
if
she
were
going
to
die
he
confided
to
his
cousin
after
a
week
in
a
troubled
tone
she
ill
i
sure
of
it
for
she
eats
no
more
than
a
little
bird
and
she
gets
weaker
every
day
i
think
i
had
better
have
the
doctor
up
do
you
she
answered
anxiously
yes
i
send
him
when
i
go
out
teddy
replied
and
then
he
went
back
to
the
young
girl
who
was
lying
back
in
an
trying
to
interest
herself
in
a
little
book
of
poems
he
had
brought
her
with
some
flowers
do
you
find
anything
pretty
in
it
he
asked
tenderly
i
i
do
know
i
afraid
i
not
tried
she
answered
penitently
ashamed
that
she
could
not
seem
happier
to
these
kind
friends
who
were
so
good
he
took
the
book
from
her
hands
and
began
to
read
aloud
some
pretty
bits
here
and
there
in
a
musical
and
voice
listen
to
this
i
am
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
that
it
is
pretty
he
said
and
read
softly
love
so
sweet
at
first
so
bitter
in
the
end
thou
canst
be
fiercest
foe
as
well
as
fairest
friend
thou
art
swift
to
slay
despite
thy
kiss
and
clasp
thy
long
caressing
look
thy
subtle
thrilling
grasp
cruel
as
the
grave
go
go
and
come
no
more
but
canst
thou
set
my
heart
just
where
it
was
before
go
and
come
no
more
go
leave
me
with
thy
tears
the
only
gift
of
thine
that
shall
outlive
the
years
kathleen
face
was
bent
on
her
hand
teddy
heard
a
smothered
sob
but
he
did
not
know
with
what
terrible
directness
the
words
had
gone
to
her
heart
he
believed
that
she
was
and
it
is
too
sad
for
you
is
it
not
he
exclaimed
i
will
read
you
something
brighter
may
talk
of
love
in
a
cottage
and
bowers
of
trellised
vine
of
nature
bewitchingly
simple
and
milkmaids
half
divine
give
me
a
sly
flirtation
by
the
light
of
a
chandelier
with
music
to
play
in
the
pauses
and
nobody
very
near
kathleen
actually
gave
a
soft
little
laugh
for
teddy
had
read
the
lines
with
such
gusto
that
he
plainly
betrayed
how
much
the
sentiment
was
to
his
mind
he
started
flushed
then
said
with
his
unvarying
good
nature
ah
how
cruel
but
never
mind
so
that
i
made
you
feel
brighter
have
i
kathleen
you
are
too
good
to
me
the
girl
answered
gratefully
moved
by
his
kindness
too
good
ah
not
as
good
as
i
would
like
to
be
if
only
you
would
let
me
cried
the
young
man
ardently
ah
kathleen
he
continued
impulsively
do
you
remember
how
i
used
to
love
you
how
i
begged
you
to
be
my
wife
my
darling
girl
i
as
fond
of
you
as
ever
wo
you
try
to
love
me
i
would
be
the
proudest
boy
in
christendom
if
you
would
marry
me
do
talk
to
me
of
love
please
do
cried
kathleen
keeping
her
ardent
lover
at
bay
with
two
entreating
white
hands
well
i
wo
at
least
not
and
i
beg
your
pardon
dear
if
i
intruded
on
your
grief
with
my
selfish
love
but
i
thought
thought
it
might
please
you
to
know
that
there
was
one
who
loved
you
even
better
since
your
reverse
of
fortune
than
before
teddy
explained
humbly
you
are
too
good
to
me
she
repeated
as
before
incoherently
touched
by
his
devotion
and
contrasting
it
in
her
mind
with
the
treachery
of
that
other
one
so
dearly
loved
so
deeply
false
then
may
i
hope
kathleen
oh
no
no
no
i
shall
never
love
nor
marry
any
one
she
answered
vehemently
but
teddy
darrell
did
not
in
the
least
believe
her
he
thought
that
all
young
girls
were
sure
to
love
some
day
and
almost
certain
to
marry
he
determined
to
keep
on
hoping
and
trying
to
win
this
peerless
beauty
kathleen
guessed
what
his
thoughts
were
and
it
made
her
very
uneasy
if
i
remain
here
with
his
cousin
he
will
expect
me
to
marry
him
she
thought
i
can
not
do
it
for
i
do
not
love
him
i
must
go
away
again
and
that
very
day
she
wrote
to
her
mother
relatives
in
richmond
the
ones
to
whom
she
was
going
when
overtaken
by
such
an
awful
fate
at
lincoln
station
kathleen
was
so
weak
that
it
tired
her
now
even
to
write
a
letter
and
the
pen
dragged
wearily
before
she
finished
the
recital
of
her
sorrows
and
pleaded
with
these
unknown
kin
to
let
her
come
to
them
just
for
a
little
while
until
she
was
strong
enough
to
go
out
into
the
wide
cruel
world
and
earn
her
own
living
with
those
weak
white
hands
chapter
xxxi
kathleen
weary
waiting
oh
you
tangled
my
life
in
your
hair
was
a
silken
and
golden
snare
but
so
gentle
the
bondage
my
soul
did
implore
the
right
to
continue
your
slave
evermore
miles
teddy
darrell
sent
up
a
doctor
to
see
kathleen
and
he
was
startled
when
he
found
that
the
young
girl
was
suffering
from
arsenical
poisoning
it
is
quite
well
that
you
sent
for
me
because
if
this
had
gone
any
further
she
might
have
died
but
i
will
go
at
once
to
work
to
remove
the
effects
of
the
poison
from
her
system
doctor
spicer
said
gravely
stone
was
shocked
but
she
readily
comprehended
that
the
woman
fedora
had
placed
the
deadly
drug
in
kathleen
food
intending
to
compass
her
death
by
slow
degrees
what
mystified
her
was
the
motive
kathleen
while
confiding
the
rest
of
her
harrowing
story
to
these
kind
friends
teddy
darrell
and
his
cousin
had
withheld
the
story
of
ralph
chainey
connection
with
her
trouble
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
mention
his
name
something
in
her
heart
pleaded
mutely
for
the
culprit
what
if
the
woman
had
lied
to
her
what
if
she
had
been
lured
from
ralph
by
a
cunning
ruse
her
brain
reeled
sometimes
with
this
suspicion
and
she
felt
that
she
should
go
mad
with
the
miserable
uncertainty
of
it
all
where
was
ralph
oh
if
she
could
only
see
him
find
out
the
real
truth
so
she
did
not
tell
her
friends
anything
about
ralph
and
stone
had
no
clew
to
the
mystery
of
this
attempt
on
her
life
she
does
not
dream
of
it
and
perhaps
it
will
be
as
well
not
to
tell
her
she
has
already
suffered
so
much
through
her
unknown
foes
thought
the
kind
lady
several
weeks
passed
and
kathleen
began
to
grow
stronger
and
better
under
the
physician
treatment
but
in
all
this
time
no
reply
to
her
letter
to
her
southern
relatives
had
been
received
neither
had
the
fact
of
kathleen
return
to
boston
ever
transpired
among
her
former
friends
in
the
city
carew
was
the
only
one
who
knew
that
kathleen
really
lived
and
it
was
to
her
interest
to
keep
it
a
secret
teddy
darrell
remained
silent
on
the
subject
because
the
natural
selfishness
of
a
lover
made
him
wish
to
keep
away
all
other
lovers
until
he
had
had
his
own
chance
to
win
or
lose
it
all
stone
quiet
and
retired
life
helped
to
keep
kathleen
presence
in
her
house
unknown
she
was
a
rising
authoress
devoted
to
her
children
and
her
pen
she
had
first
commenced
to
write
after
her
husband
death
as
a
solace
to
her
loneliness
and
grief
success
had
made
literature
her
life
work
and
she
devoted
herself
to
it
going
but
little
into
society
and
receiving
few
friends
kathleen
began
to
look
better
but
she
chafed
bitterly
in
secret
over
the
strange
silence
of
her
relatives
why
would
they
not
write
her
a
few
lines
even
if
they
did
not
want
her
with
them
did
they
care
nothing
then
for
the
unhappy
child
of
their
poor
dead
zaidee
she
had
written
to
them
so
frankly
so
appealingly
tried
to
open
her
whole
heart
to
them
but
there
came
no
response
and
dearly
as
she
loved
her
good
friend
stone
kathleen
chafed
at
her
enforced
dependence
on
her
kindness
she
saw
so
plainly
through
her
little
matchmaking
scheme
and
she
was
so
touched
by
devotion
silent
and
unobtrusive
since
that
day
when
he
had
spoken
out
so
impulsively
but
still
patent
to
all
observers
she
was
so
lonely
so
friendless
and
she
knew
it
was
nobler
in
him
to
cling
to
her
now
when
she
was
no
longer
a
belle
and
heiress
but
only
a
waif
tossed
back
almost
from
the
grave
into
a
world
that
denied
and
disowned
her
teddy
never
seemed
to
remember
that
he
was
as
courteous
and
deferential
as
he
had
ever
been
to
miss
carew
the
courted
heiress
every
day
he
brought
her
gifts
of
books
and
flowers
often
he
came
with
a
carriage
to
take
her
and
stone
to
ride
he
did
not
speak
to
kathleen
of
his
love
again
but
his
great
black
eyes
looked
unutterable
things
and
she
knew
that
despite
his
usual
variableness
he
was
true
at
least
to
this
love
yes
teddy
heart
was
touched
for
once
and
he
loved
bonny
kathleen
even
more
warmly
than
in
the
former
time
when
she
had
all
that
love
could
give
all
that
makes
it
sweet
to
live
fond
caresses
jewels
dresses
and
with
eloquent
appeal
many
a
proud
and
rich
adorer
knelt
in
metaphor
before
her
teddy
could
not
realize
but
that
kathleen
would
return
his
love
some
time
he
knew
he
was
a
catch
in
worldly
parlance
and
he
knew
that
he
was
good
to
look
upon
why
then
should
not
beautiful
kathleen
learn
to
love
him
other
girls
had
found
it
easy
to
do
so
girls
for
whom
he
had
not
cared
an
iota
only
to
amuse
himself
this
was
different
teddy
flirting
teddy
had
found
heaven
at
last
in
a
girl
eyes
deep
dark
eyes
like
shady
pools
in
their
thick
fringes
her
glance
thrilled
him
the
touch
of
her
soft
cool
little
hand
burned
like
fire
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
his
love
for
her
and
his
desire
to
marry
her
and
lift
her
again
to
her
old
proud
position
once
my
wife
she
should
queen
it
over
that
alpine
belmont
who
got
all
her
money
he
said
to
his
cousin
she
should
have
one
of
the
finest
houses
in
boston
horses
and
carriages
jewels
and
fine
dresses
and
i
would
worship
the
very
ground
she
trod
on
chapter
xxxii
we
have
met
we
have
loved
we
have
parted
farewell
farewell
for
aye
farewell
yet
must
i
end
as
i
began
i
love
you
love
you
love
but
you
joaquin
miller
kathleen
gave
up
all
hope
of
ever
hearing
from
her
southern
relatives
they
do
not
care
for
me
and
i
must
not
expect
anything
of
them
she
sighed
and
the
thought
came
to
her
that
now
she
had
been
at
stone
six
weeks
and
grown
well
and
strong
again
she
must
seek
a
situation
as
a
teacher
and
support
herself
i
suppose
i
could
teach
little
children
and
i
must
try
to
find
some
place
it
is
unfair
to
my
kind
friend
for
me
to
remain
here
longer
she
sighed
and
stole
softly
down
to
the
library
for
a
morning
paper
to
consult
the
advertisements
as
the
girl
glided
softly
across
the
floor
a
low
murmur
of
voices
reached
her
through
the
falling
curtains
from
the
adjoining
parlor
the
girl
gave
a
violent
start
and
sunk
tremblingly
into
the
nearest
chair
she
was
pale
as
death
and
her
heart
beat
violently
against
her
side
what
was
it
what
had
startled
the
young
girl
so
much
the
sound
of
a
voice
had
pierced
her
heart
like
a
it
was
ralph
chainey
voice
so
deep
so
sweet
so
mellow
that
once
heard
it
could
never
be
forgotten
especially
by
one
who
loved
him
so
despairingly
as
did
our
poor
kathleen
he
was
speaking
to
stone
and
for
one
wild
moment
kathleen
believed
that
he
had
traced
her
here
that
he
had
come
to
inquire
for
her
surely
then
he
could
not
be
guilty
or
conscience
would
have
kept
him
away
she
strained
her
ears
to
catch
every
tone
of
that
deep
sweet
voice
and
then
she
heard
him
speaking
to
stone
of
her
literary
work
he
had
been
so
struck
with
the
force
of
one
of
her
books
that
he
wanted
her
to
dramatize
it
for
him
or
write
him
a
new
play
all
unaware
of
kathleen
nearness
to
him
the
young
actor
had
come
here
to
this
house
seemingly
led
by
the
subtle
hand
of
fate
kathleen
glided
to
the
falling
curtains
and
drawing
one
ever
so
lightly
apart
gazed
with
eager
yearning
eyes
into
the
room
her
hungry
eyes
feasted
on
the
sight
of
her
false
lover
as
he
sat
in
full
view
opposite
stone
in
a
large
velvet
never
it
seemed
to
bonny
kathleen
had
she
seen
him
look
so
grandly
handsome
not
even
in
his
spirited
impersonation
of
prince
karl
in
which
he
had
so
thrilled
her
girlish
heart
but
ralph
chainey
was
pale
and
in
his
splendid
thoughtful
brown
eyes
lay
the
haunting
shadow
of
a
cruel
pain
he
was
tortured
by
his
failure
to
find
lost
kathleen
but
the
conventional
smile
that
played
over
his
handsome
face
as
he
talked
to
the
gifted
woman
before
him
deceived
kathleen
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
well
and
happy
that
he
had
forgotten
that
she
ever
lived
the
girl
he
had
pretended
to
love
so
dearly
i
have
the
plot
of
a
new
story
upstairs
in
my
study
and
i
believe
it
is
just
the
thing
you
want
chainey
said
stone
vivaciously
she
rose
and
added
i
will
go
and
get
it
but
if
i
am
some
little
time
away
please
go
into
the
library
and
amuse
yourself
with
a
book
i
must
confess
that
i
am
very
careless
and
often
misplace
my
manuscripts
stone
vanished
through
the
door
and
ralph
chainey
who
was
so
unhappy
that
he
dreaded
nothing
so
much
as
his
own
sad
thoughts
immediately
turned
toward
the
library
kathleen
gave
a
gasp
of
surprise
and
terror
and
turned
to
fly
she
was
too
late
even
as
her
hand
fell
from
the
curtain
ralph
chainey
swept
it
aside
and
entered
the
strangely
parted
lovers
were
face
to
face
for
a
moment
the
young
man
was
only
conscious
that
stone
library
was
occupied
by
a
beautiful
young
girl
but
the
moan
that
burst
uncontrollably
from
kathleen
white
lips
made
him
glance
more
closely
at
the
young
girl
face
and
then
he
saw
that
it
was
his
missing
love
a
cry
of
joyful
astonishment
broke
from
him
and
he
sprung
forward
crying
eagerly
kathleen
my
darling
his
arms
closed
about
her
he
pressed
her
closely
to
his
throbbing
breast
kathleen
eyes
closed
and
her
golden
head
sunk
heavily
on
her
breast
she
had
almost
fainted
with
the
shock
of
seeing
him
so
suddenly
combined
with
the
exquisite
rapture
and
pain
of
his
fond
embrace
but
even
while
he
showered
kisses
on
her
fair
face
and
closed
eyes
memory
and
reason
began
to
assert
themselves
she
struggled
faintly
in
his
clasp
and
he
perceived
that
she
was
trying
to
free
herself
instantly
he
opened
his
arms
and
allowed
her
to
go
free
for
ralph
chainey
was
one
of
the
proudest
of
men
and
would
not
force
his
caresses
on
any
one
but
he
said
eagerly
although
with
a
slight
tone
of
reproach
in
his
voice
kathleen
my
dearest
how
came
you
here
and
why
was
it
that
i
found
you
gone
that
night
when
i
returned
to
the
station
the
color
flushed
hotly
into
her
pale
face
but
she
stood
apart
looking
at
him
with
burning
eyes
and
not
uttering
one
word
kathleen
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
strangely
exclaimed
her
lover
in
reproachful
wonder
has
your
heart
changed
toward
me
did
you
repent
your
promise
to
marry
me
that
night
and
run
away
or
did
your
enemies
find
you
as
you
feared
they
would
tell
me
the
truth
my
darling
but
still
she
did
not
speak
in
truth
she
could
not
there
was
a
hysteric
constriction
in
her
throat
that
held
it
tight
as
with
iron
bands
she
gazed
with
unwilling
fascination
into
the
large
pleading
brown
eyes
of
her
lover
her
young
heart
throbbing
wildly
in
her
breast
kathleen
what
have
i
done
that
you
will
not
even
speak
to
me
he
asked
piteously
and
all
her
heart
thrilled
at
the
words
her
will
was
hardly
strong
enough
to
restrain
her
from
springing
into
his
arms
his
glance
deep
reproachful
loving
and
magnetic
all
in
one
held
her
like
a
charm
it
shot
down
her
soul
deep
heaven
like
a
meteor
trailing
fire
a
long
long
troubled
sigh
breathed
over
the
girl
sweet
lips
and
with
a
great
effort
of
her
will
she
drooped
her
eyelids
so
that
they
could
not
encounter
his
gaze
for
i
dare
not
or
i
should
everything
for
his
dear
love
she
thought
wildly
she
mystified
him
so
by
her
strange
behavior
that
he
forgot
his
pride
and
again
advanced
toward
her
side
kathleen
my
love
my
darling
speak
to
me
if
only
one
word
he
cried
yearningly
passionately
and
finding
her
voice
at
last
she
faltered
to
him
in
a
despairing
tone
did
you
ever
ever
know
a
woman
named
fedora
my
god
cried
ralph
chainey
he
flung
up
one
hand
to
his
brow
and
reeled
backward
from
her
side
like
one
wounded
to
the
death
so
it
is
true
kathleen
cried
in
a
hollow
voice
full
of
bitter
anguish
ralph
chainey
looked
at
her
with
sad
eyes
from
which
all
the
brightness
had
strangely
faded
who
has
told
you
he
asked
in
a
dull
voice
she
told
me
herself
kathleen
answered
and
shot
him
an
indignant
glance
pride
coming
to
her
rescue
there
could
no
longer
be
any
doubt
of
his
guilt
his
looks
confessed
it
but
he
faltered
in
a
dazed
voice
that
is
impossible
she
is
dead
you
can
not
deceive
me
like
that
ralph
chainey
cried
kathleen
in
tempestuous
anger
her
eyes
flashed
lightning
on
her
recreant
lover
and
she
continued
bitterly
your
wife
came
to
me
that
night
in
the
station
and
told
me
all
she
she
took
me
away
what
was
she
like
demanded
the
young
man
hoarsely
he
seemed
dazed
by
sudden
misery
she
was
a
beautiful
blonde
with
a
haughty
manner
answered
kathleen
and
he
groaned
as
if
there
could
be
no
longer
any
hope
i
have
been
duped
deceived
i
believed
that
fedora
was
dead
long
ago
he
said
angrily
then
his
voice
grew
softer
kathleen
will
you
let
me
explain
it
all
he
pleaded
humbly
but
in
the
heart
of
the
beautiful
passionate
young
girl
there
had
suddenly
leaped
into
life
the
devouring
flame
of
jealousy
jealousy
and
hate
for
the
woman
who
had
thrust
her
rival
into
the
pit
of
a
black
despair
and
he
had
deceived
her
it
seemed
to
her
she
must
go
mad
with
her
wrongs
in
this
moment
she
hated
her
lover
she
turned
on
him
with
a
tigerish
glare
in
her
splendid
eyes
i
will
hear
nothing
she
said
bitterly
you
will
never
have
the
chance
to
deceive
me
again
and
she
rushed
angrily
from
the
room
chapter

ralph
chainey
anger
i
can
not
break
the
cruel
net
and
yet
my
eyes
with
scornful
tears
are
wet
release
me
teach
me
to
forget
celia
thaxter
kathleen
gained
her
own
room
locked
the
door
and
fell
prostrate
on
the
floor
in
a
passion
of
blinding
grief
and
jealous
anger
tears
came
to
her
relief
and
rained
down
her
cheeks
in
a
tempest
of
emotion
will
he
go
away
or
will
he
remain
tell
stone
my
whole
story
and
beg
her
to
plead
his
cause
with
me
she
asked
herself
and
hoped
unconsciously
that
he
would
she
did
not
know
the
young
man
sturdy
pride
he
had
waited
for
stone
transacted
his
business
with
her
and
gone
away
without
a
word
she
did
not
love
me
or
she
would
have
let
me
explain
it
all
as
i
wished
she
did
not
care
to
have
the
barrier
between
us
swept
away
so
be
it
let
her
go
she
is
not
worthy
such
love
as
i
gave
her
he
thought
with
scorn
of
the
heart
that
could
trample
on
such
devotion
the
spirit
of
eager
youth
that
named
her
queen
of
queens
at
once
and
loved
her
in
very
truth
that
threw
its
pearl
of
pearls
at
her
feet
and
offered
her
in
a
breath
the
costliest
gift
a
man
can
give
from
his
cradle
to
his
death
his
brow
clouded
with
a
heavy
frown
as
he
thought
of
the
woman
who
had
turned
the
heart
of
his
fair
young
love
so
cruelly
against
him
does
she
really
live
have
i
been
duped
by
a
cunning
lie
a
trick
to
extort
the
price
of
a
costly
funeral
i
almost
believe
it
let
me
find
out
if
it
is
true
and
bitter
shall
be
that
fiend
punishment
he
mused
with
almost
savage
intensity
he
had
reached
boston
only
that
morning
and
he
had
promised
alpine
belmont
who
had
written
to
him
almost
every
day
since
he
left
that
he
would
call
upon
her
very
soon
wondering
if
she
knew
of
presence
in
the
city
he
bent
his
steps
toward
commonwealth
avenue
meanwhile
stone
full
of
elation
at
the
compliments
paid
her
by
the
gifted
actor
and
eager
to
share
her
pleasure
with
kathleen
went
upstairs
and
tapped
softly
on
the
door
kathleen
opened
it
and
her
friend
started
with
surprise
at
seeing
her
face
flushed
and
her
eyes
swollen
with
weeping
do
not
mind
me
it
it
is
nothing
was
all
she
would
say
in
reply
to
stone
sympathetic
inquiries
and
at
last
the
authoress
plunged
into
her
own
affairs
telling
kathleen
all
about
ralph
chainey
visit
and
his
wish
that
she
should
write
a
play
for
him
he
has
taken
away
the
plot
of
my
new
novel
to
read
and
he
will
return
in
a
few
days
to
tell
me
how
he
likes
it
if
i
succeed
in
pleasing
him
i
shall
be
famous
she
exclaimed
i
hope
that
you
will
succeed
kathleen
said
earnestly
have
you
ever
seen
ralph
chainey
act
my
dear
and
did
you
like
him
i
have
seen
him
and
i
think
he
is
a
grand
actor
the
girl
replied
quietly
how
would
you
like
to
go
and
see
him
he
plays
parisian
romance
i
am
sure
he
will
be
splendid
in
that
as
he
is
in
everything
we
will
take
teddy
with
us
what
do
you
say
my
dear
kathleen
hesitated
her
heart
throbbing
wildly
with
the
blended
love
and
hate
she
now
felt
for
the
handsome
lover
who
had
so
wickedly
deceived
and
betrayed
her
girlish
trust
then
a
sudden
temptation
came
to
her
to
stab
his
heart
as
cruelly
as
he
had
done
hers
why
not
go
with
teddy
who
loved
her
so
dearly
and
pretend
to
return
his
devotion
i
should
be
delighted
to
go
she
said
unfalteringly
to

alpine
sows
the
seed
of
jealousy
they
have
told
you
some
false
story
you
believe
them
all
they
say
you
are
false
but
i
forgive
you
but
forget
i
never
may
you
startle
me
kathleen
really
alive
kathleen
here
in
the
same
city
with
us
exclaimed
alpine
belmont
in
genuine
surprise
ralph
chainey
had
been
telling
her
all
about
his
visit
to
stone
and
his
unexpected
with
his
lost
love
some
one
has
been
slandering
me
to
her
and
she
hates
me
now
she
refused
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
me
he
ended
with
a
long
sigh
the
beauty
lashes
fell
to
hide
her
blue
eyes
exultant
gleam
oh
how
cruel
of
kathleen
she
exclaimed
she
sighed
and
added
in
a
low
tender
voice
how
could
any
one
be
cruel
to
he
hardly
noticed
the
purport
of
her
speech
he
was
so
absorbed
in
thought
you
will
go
to
her
miss
belmont
you
will
bring
her
home
he
pleaded
but
perhaps
she
will
not
come
with
me
is
it
not
a
little
strange
that
she
did
not
come
here
at
first
mr
chainey
yes
it
is
strange
there
is
something
very
mysterious
about
this
affair
but
go
to
her
miss
belmont
and
no
doubt
she
will
give
you
her
confidence
be
her
friend
if
she
needs
one
pleaded
the
lover
forgetting
his
wrath
against
kathleen
in
anxiety
over
her
welfare
i
will
go
promised
alpine
soothingly
and
you
will
bring
her
home
with
you
if
she
will
come
answered
alpine
then
she
gave
a
violent
start
exclaiming
oh
i
just
remembered
something
well
asked
the
young
man
eagerly
stone
is
own
cousin
to
teddy
darrell
and
he
was
kathleen
lover
last
winter
can
there
be
any
connection
between
her
being
there
with
stone
whom
i
certain
she
used
not
to
know
and
teddy
darrell
the
shaft
went
home
she
saw
him
pale
and
tremble
with
jealous
dread
i
know
teddy
darrell
he
said
trying
to
speak
carelessly
did
did
she
ever
care
for
yes
i
believe
so
there
was
a
flirtation
anyway
and
we
thought
once
it
would
be
a
match
but
suddenly
it
all
came
to
nothing
i
know
who
was
to
blame
but
i
afraid
it
was
teddy
he
known
to
be
and
a
wretched
flirt
how
sweetly
and
artlessly
she
spoke
but
every
word
was
a
in
the
hearer
heart
wan
and
haggard
with
misery
he
rose
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
restlessly
alpine
watched
him
under
her
lashes
her
breast
heaving
with
its
love
and
pain
yet
she
knew
that
she
was
no
more
to
him
than
a
hundred
other
girls
whose
names
he
barely
knew
save
and
except
that
she
was
kathleen
she
was
not
the
rose
but
she
had
lived
near
it
it
was
cruelly
hard
when
she
loved
him
so
dearly
the
temptation
seized
her
to
fall
at
his
feet
to
cry
out
to
him
that
she
could
not
live
without
him
that
she
was
going
mad
for
his
dear
love
she
recoiled
with
horror
from
the
thought
no
no
he
would
despise
her
let
her
show
him
tenderness
and
sympathy
but
not
love
by
and
by
he
might
turn
to
her
when
he
became
convinced
that
kathleen
was
lost
to
him
forever
and
she
is
she
shall
be
vowed
the
girl
and
after
watching
ralph
in
silence
for
some
moments
while
he
strode
up
and
down
seemingly
oblivious
of
her
presence
she
moved
to
his
side
and
slipping
her
hand
timidly
within
his
arm
murmured
softly
do
not
worry
over
it
please
dear
friend
even
if
kathleen
is
lost
to
you
there
are
hundreds
of
other
girls
as
well
worth
the
winning
he
did
not
answer
he
was
dumb
with
despair
but
he
suffered
alpine
to
cling
to
his
arm
and
walk
up
and
down
by
his
side
murmuring
low
words
of
sympathy
all
the
while
i
shall
scold
kathleen
for
her
cruelty
to
you
you
did
not
deserve
it
for
you
were
true
to
her
she
said
and
sighed
ah
how
sad
it
is
for
one
love
to
prove
false
false
and
fickle
he
turned
on
her
almost
fiercely
you
believe
that
she
loves
this
darrell
he
exclaimed
i
believe
she
does
answered
alpine
with
pretended
reluctance
exulting
in
the
pain
she
saw
on
his
face
it
gave
her
a
savage
joy
to
wound
him
in
his
love
for
kathleen
she
longed
to
make
him
hate
the
hapless
girl
as
bitterly
as
she
herself
hated
her
i
must
go
he
said
abruptly
then
as
she
clung
to
his
hand
do
not
forget
your
promise
to
go
to
her
and
you
will
send
me
a
note
i
play
here
all
this
week
yes
you
shall
hear
from
me
i
shall
see
you
again
too
for
coming
every
night
to
see
you
act
she
answered
sweetly
thank
you
he
replied
dropped
her
hand
and
went
away
never
remembering
how
lovingly
the
blue
eyes
had
looked
into
his
nor
how
tenderly
she
had
spoken
it
was
kathleen
of
whom
he
was
thinking
his
sweet
estranged
love

falsehood
so
dearly
loved
so
deeply

ah
why
should
i
regret
thee
was
fatal
to
my
peace
of

the
hour
when

i
met
thee
mcv
miller
when
the
curtain
rose
that
night
on
ralph
chainey
in
the
beautiful
play
a
parisian
romance
there
were
seated
in
opposite
boxes
the
beautiful
rivals
for
the
handsome
actor
love
alpine
belmont
in
one
box
with
her
haughty
mother
and
in
the
other
kathleen
carew
chaperoned
by
stone
and
with
teddy
darrell
hanging
adoringly
over
her
chair
kathleen
was
all
in
white
a
simple
form
of
mourning
and
white
flowers
set
off
by
their
own
green
leaves
were
her
only
adorning
and
teddy
darrell
well
the
young
swell
was
gotten
up
regardless
as
one
of
his
friends
remarked
a
golden
youth
like
himself
his
evening
dress
was
faultless
and
his
bouquet
matched
white
flowers
his
diamonds
were
magnificent
and
his
whole
air
was
so
hopeful
and
exuberant
that
when
ralph
chainey
from
the
stage
first
caught
sight
of
him
his
heart
sunk
with
despair
he
felt
that
flirting
teddy
was
a
rival
to
be
dreaded
why
need
she
have
come
to
torture
me
with
the
sight
of
all
i
have
lost
he
thought
despairingly
but
he
went
on
splendidly
with
his
part
in
the
play
a
stubborn
pride
came
to
his
aid
she
should
not
see
how
he
was
suffering
this
lovely
scornful
girl
leaning
back
in
her
chair
to
look
up
into
the
handsome
face
so
close
to
her
own
as
attentive
teddy
wielded
the
white
ostrich
feather
fan
she
scarcely
seemed
to
see
what
went
on
upon
the
stage
she
did
not
look
across
into
the
box
where
her
and
alpine
were
staring
in
angry
surprise
she
looked
only
at
teddy
darrell
she
smiled
only
at
him
it
was
such
a
pronounced
flirtation
that
the
crowded
house
observed
it
and
smiled
indulgently
at
the
handsome
pair
declaring
that
it
would
certainly
be
a
match
whispers
too
were
circulating
among
the
people
who
had
known
kathleen
carew
in
her
who
was
this
girl
with
the
face
and
smile
of
the
dead
heiress
that
luring
face
so
subtly
beautiful
that
no
one
had
dreamed
the
world
could
hold
a
copy
curiosity
moved
a
gentleman
when
the
curtain
fell
to
go
and
ask
carew
about
it
i
am
as
much
amazed
as
you
are
she
replied
then
you
can
not
tell
me
who
she
is
he
said
regretfully
she
is
masquerading
under
the
name
of
my
dead
and
pretends
to
be
resurrected
from
a
trance
or
something
like
that
we
first
heard
about
it
yesterday
was
carew
curt
reply
then
you
have
not
seen
her
until
no
nervously
shall
you
acknowledge
her
mrs
carew
no
she
is
an
impostor
and
we
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
minx
speak
for
yourself
mamma
said
alpine
pertly
i
not
sure
an
impostor
for
it
is
kathleen
face
and
her
very
gestures
i
am
going
over
to
stone
box
and
find
out
the
truth
for
myself
if
layne
will
take
me
she
rose
drawing
the
blue
wrap
about
her
white
shoulders
carew
stared
aghast
you
will
not
you
not
she
exclaimed
angrily
alpine
bent
down
and
whispered
rapidly
in
her
ear
what
does
it
matter
i
have
her
money
safe
she
could
not
get
it
if
she
lived
a
thousand
years
and
i
have
my
own
plans
you
must
not
interfere
with
them
when
alpine
took
that
tone
her
mother
knew
that
protest
was
useless
do
as
you
please
she
muttered
angrily
and
tossed
her
head
as
alpine
went
out
leaning
on
layne
arm
what
is
the
girl
up
to
i
wonder
she
mused
uneasily
she
always
had
a
sneaking
fondness
for
kathleen
and
would
be
just
silly
enough
to
bring
her
home
to
live
with
us
she
shall
not
do
it
no
matter
what
the
world
says
i
always
hated
the
girl
for
the
look
she
has
of
her
dead
mother
carew
was
jealous
of
the
very
memory
of
poor
zaidee
and
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
her
beautiful
daughter
she
writhed
with
anger
when
she
saw
alpine
embrace
kathleen
kathleen
is
it
really
you
oh
you
darling
let
me
kiss
you
she
cried
effusively
and
put
her
arms
impulsively
about
the
young
girl
kathleen
recoiled
from
her
at
first
she
thought
that
alpine
knew
all
about
her
mother
cruelty
but
as
alpine
held
her
in
that
warm
embrace
she
exclaimed
kathleen
why
did
you
not
come
home
to
us
kathleen
released
herself
from
alpine
answering
bitterly
i
came
but
your
mother
denied
me
and
put
me
out
into
the
street
unconscious
to
perish
in
the
snow
impossible
cried
alpine
but
there
came
to
her
all
in
a
rush
the
memory
of
that
night
when
her
mother
had
told
her
that
a
woman
had
come
to
see
ivan
and
she
had
driven
her
away
she
deceived
me
it
was
kathleen
she
thought
and
exclaimed
eagerly
my
dearest
girl
she
did
not
tell
me
anything
about
it
but
of
course
she
believed
you
were
an
impostor
you
believe
me
you
will
let
me
be
your
friend
kathleen
anxiously
come
and
see
me
at
stone
alpine
her
answered
and
then
turned
to
the
gentleman
how
do
you
do
layne
will
you
too
take
me
for
an
impostor
she
inquired
holding
out
her
little
hand
to
him
no
indeed
miss
carew
for
i
am
sure
there
can
not
be
a
copy
of
your
beautiful
face
in
all
the
world
he
replied
gallantly
being
an
elderly
widower
he
felt
privileged
to
pay
broad
compliments
kathleen
blushed
and
smiled
and
the
curtain
rising
at
that
moment
showed
ralph
chainey
that
alpine
had
seized
the
first
opportunity
to
go
and
see
kathleen
he
was
intensely
pleased
with
alpine
loyalty
she
is
a
better
girl
than
i
used
to
think
he
decided
and
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
her
box
the
first
opportunity
to
thank
her
for
her
goodness
he
did
not
dream
that
alpine
was
whispering
at
that
moment
little
poisoned
arrows
into
kathleen
ear
about
himself
nor
of
the
cruel
pain
that
tore
kathleen
heart
as
she
heard
of
her
lover
liking
for
alpine
when
he
came
yesterday
he
told
me
of
your
being
at
stone
what
a
shock
it
was
to
know
you
were
really
living
but
i
must
go
back
to
mamma
now
and
i
come
and
see
you
and
hear
all
about
your
little
romance
tearing
herself
away
just
as
she
expected
ralph
hurried
to
her
box
as
soon
as
the
curtain
fell
what
did
she
say
he
whispered
eagerly
and
kathleen
who
was
watching
them
felt
her
heart
thrill
with
renewed
bitterness
as
she
saw
the
curly
brown
head
bent
low
over
alpine
one
he
is
doing
it
to
pique
me
she
thought
but
she
could
not
turn
her
burning
dark
eyes
away
from
the
sight
alpine
looked
up
smilingly
into
the
pale
anxious
face
she
told
me
to
come
and
see
her
and
hear
her
story
there
was
not
time
she
replied
he
was
disappointed
she
read
it
in
his
speaking
countenance
and
added
she
gave
me
one
bit
of
news
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
ought
to
tell
you
please
do
so
he
urged
it
will
pain
you
i
fear
sighed
alpine
i
am
strong
enough
to
bear
anything
except
suspense
setting
his
teeth
firmly
carew
was
looking
at
them
curiously
mamma
will
you
please
excuse
us
for
whispering
i
have
something
to
tell
chainey
a
secret
you
are
excusable
the
lady
replied
sourly
turning
away
her
head
alpine
whispered
to
ralph
kathleen
is
engaged
to
be
married
to
teddy
darrell
and
is
the
happiest
girl
i
ever
saw
he
was
silent
a
moment
then
murmured
bitterly
she
has
no
heart
how
could
she
turn
so
quickly
from
one
love
to
another
she
is
fickle
as
the
wind
alpine
answered
with
a
contemptuous
shrug

had
come
and
gone
under
a
mask
of
sweetness
and
love
she
had
tortured
kathleen
heart
my
dear
girl
how
fortunate
you
are
to
have
caught
teddy

she
exclaimed
after
kathleen
had
told
her
the
story
of
her
adventures
save
and
excepting
about
fedora
claim
that
she
was
ralph
wife
that
one
dread
secret
the
girl
kept
locked
close
in
her
heart
fortunate
kathleen
echoed
dully
yes
alpine
answered
he
is
rich
and
unless
you
are
going
to
marry
him
it
does
not
look
well
for
you
to
remain
with
mrs
stone
but
alpine
i
have
no
other
place
to
go
stone
is
my
only
friend
she
is
your
friend
because
her
cousin
wants
to
marry
you
and
if
you
refuse
teddy
she
will
be
very
angry
do
you
think
so
alpine
the
young
girl
exclaimed
startled
at
the
idea
i
am
sure
of
it
my
advice
to
you
is
to
marry
teddy
but
i
do
not
love
him
alpine
i
i
loved
ralph
chainey
once
so
dearly
that
i
feel
that
i
can
never
love
another
why
have
you
turned
against
ralph
asked
her
curiously
i
can
not
tell
you
faltered
kathleen
do
you
love
him
still
no
kathleen
answered
spiritedly
but
alpine
did
not
believe
one
word
kathleen
how
would
you
like
to
come
back
home
she
asked
your
mother
would
not
permit
it
sighed
the
young
girl
it
is
because
she
does
not
believe
you
are
really
kathleen
she
thinks
you
an
impostor
i
have
been
talking
to
her
trying
to
get
her
consent
to
bring
you
home
kathleen
looked
curiously
at
her
puzzled
by
her
odd
air
of
hesitancy
well
go
on
what
is
it
she
asked
with
that
little
imperious
manner
inseparable
from
herself
she
would
not
agree
except
on
one
condition
kathleen
looked
at
her
in
silent
wonder
and
with
pretended
sorrow
alpine
said
the
condition
was
that
you
come
as
a
housemaid
as
a
paid
servant
she
saw
with
silent
secret
malice
the
angry
crimson
mount
to
kathleen
pearly
cheek
and
remained
silent
a
few
moments
to
enjoy
the
sensation
of
proud
kathleen
humiliated
kathleen
was
indeed
furious
with
resentment
and
for
a
moment
she
could
not
speak
for
the
great
lump
in
her
throat
then
she
fought
down
her
emotion
with
an
iron
will
and
looked
straight
at
her
tormentor
saying
coolly
i
suppose
it
is
so
hard
for
your
mother
to
forget
the
position
she
once
occupied
in
my
father
house
that
she
would
be
glad
to
sink
his
daughter

the

she
always
hated
to
remember
that
her
mother
had
been
zaidee
carew
governess
and
that
it
was
hinted
that
her
arts
had
driven
the
artless
to
despair
and
death
but
it
was
not
her
policy
to
seem
offended
with
kathleen
to
propitiate
ralph
chainey
she
must
still
seem
to
be
the
friend
of
the
girl
he
loved
so
dearly
so
she
looked
at
her
lovely
rival
with
a
sad
sweet
smile
and
said
of
course
i
knew
that
you
would
not
come
that
way
and
i
told
mamma
so
but
she
made
me
promise
to
tell
you
what
she
said
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
dear
for
i
have
a
better
plan
for
you
the
young
girl
looked
at
her
in
angry
silence
asking
herself
what
new
insult
you
know
of
course
that
your
father
in
a
fit
of
anger
against
you
left
me
all
his
money
in
a
will
asked
alpine
kathleen
nodded
coldly
i
am
going
to
make
you
an
allowance
to
live
on
kathleen
i
told
mamma
i
meant
to
do
so
and
she
said
your
father
did
not
intend
for
you
to
have
a
penny
of
that
money
of
course
i
knew
that
but
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
for
i
can
not
bear
to
have
you
living
on
charity
it
is
better
for
you
to
depend
on
me
for
your
support
than
on
a
stranger
do
you
think
so
yourself
kathleen
rose
up
indignant
goaded
to
fury
no
i
do
not
think
so
she
said
angrily
i
would
rather
starve
in
the
streets
than
support
life
on
an
allowance
from
you
made
out
of
the
money
that
should
be
mine
but
which
you
cheated
me
out
of
by
some
cunning
trick
known
only
to
yourself
and
your
mother
i
believe
you
are
deceitful
that
you
are
only
pretending
a
kind
feeling
for
me
to
serve
some
purpose
of
your
own
go
go
and
leave
me
to
myself
and
my
misery
there
was
something
in
the
looks
and
words
of
that
frail
beautiful
young
girl
that
compelled
obedience
from
alpine
she
rose
instantly
well
since
you
will
not
let
me
be
your
friend
she
said
and
glided
from
the
room
kathleen
walked
up
and
down
the
floor
in
a
passion
of
insulted
pride
her
cheeks
burning
her
little
fists
clinched
in
impotent
wrath
her
heart
on
fire
with
the
longing
to
avenge
herself
on
those
two
insolent
women
it
was
a
dangerous
time
to
her
for
teddy
darrell
to
enter
handsome
loving
teddy
who
adored
her
and
who
was
wild
with
anger
over
the
insult
she
had
received
for
kathleen
could
not
keep
back
her
grievance
she
told
teddy
frankly
of
carew
message
and
of
alpine
offer
great
heaven
how
mean
some
women
can
be
it
was
done
purposely
to
humiliate
you
he
exclaimed
angrily
he
looked
at
beautiful
kathleen
with
the
fire
of
her
dark
eyes
dim
with
tears
and
her
cheeks
burning
with
resentment
feeling
himself
hardly
able
to
refrain
from
taking
her
in
his
arms
and
kissing
away
the
tempestuous
tears
suddenly
his
repressed
passion
burst
forth
kathleen
my
darling
do
marry
me
ca
you
learn
to
love
me
just
a
little
i
would
be
so
fond
of
you
so
devoted
that
you
could
not
help
but
learn
to
love
me
and
i
am
rich
you
know
i
would
help
you
queen
it
over
those
insolent
women
her
heart
leaped
at
his
words
pride
carried
the
day
i
would
do
it
if
if
i
thought
i
learn
to
love
you
and
that
ought
to
be
easy
because
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
and
i
am
so
grateful
she
murmured
it
did
seem
easy
at
the
moment
teddy
was
true
teddy
loved
her
while
ralph
chainey
was
false
and
cruel
why
should
she
wear
the
willow
for
why
lie
down
in
the
dust
while
her
heartless
and
trampled
on
her
rights
and
her
feelings
so
in
a
fury
of
resentment
kathleen
gave
teddy
her
promise
to
marry
him
and
to
learn
to
love
him
chapter
xxxvii
ralph
chainey
is
driven
to
desperation
and
turns
on
his
foe
even
now
i
tell
you
i
wonder
whether
this
woman
called
estelle
is
flesh
and
blood
or
a
beautiful
lie
sent
up
from
the
depths
of
hell
edmund
clarence
stedman
ralph
chainey
went
from
alpine
presence
to
his
home
in
sumner
one
of
the
beautiful
suburbs
of
boston
and
to
the
presence
of
his
gentle
widowed
mother
who
presided
over
a
lovely
home
that
was
shared
with
her
by
an
older
son
and
his
small
family
ralph
dear
you
look
pale
you
are
ill
she
exclaimed
anxiously
my
head
aches
severely
i
will
go
to
my
room
and
lie
down
for
an
hour
to
get
my
nerves
steady
for
he
said
and
kissing
her
affectionately
he
left
her
to
seek
seclusion
for
his
aching
heart
and
brain
he
leaned
his
aching
head
on
his
hand
and
a
rush
of
bitter
memories
swept
over
him
he
saw
himself
five
years
ago
a
boy
of
brilliant
ardent
and
impetuous
just
beginning
his
dramatic
career
at
the
very
outset
he
had
fallen
into
the
toils
of
a
beautiful
actress
years
older
than
himself
by
a
clever
playing
of
her
cards
she
had
entrapped
him
into
a
marriage
but
scarcely
had
the
waned
ere
he
learned
to
his
horror
the
true
character
of
his
wife
she
was
false
light
and
wicked
and
no
entreaties
could
win
her
from
her
wicked
ways
a
separation
ensued
and
ralph
ashamed
to
court
publicity
by
applying
for
a
divorce
agreed
to
support
the
false
woman
if
she
would
promise
not
to
annoy
him
by
venturing
into
his
presence
she
accepted
these
terms
but
instead
of
retiring
to
seclusion
as
he
desired
her
fedora
as
she
called
herself
joined
a
ballet
troupe
and
scandalized
her
unfortunate
young
husband
by
her
wild
career
still
the
marriage
was
wholly
unknown
to
the
world
and
in
hopes
of
maintaining
this
silence
the
young
actor
suffered
on
patiently
his
pride
wounded
his
fancy
dead
his
soul
thrilled
with
disgust
but
one
solace
left
to
him
and
that
the
knowledge
that
his
false
wife
had
kept
faith
with
him
in
preserving
his
secret
kept
faith
because
he
had
threatened
her
with
exposure
and
divorce
upon
its
betrayal
at
last
she
had
broken
faith
and
bitterest
of
all
had
betrayed
his
miserable
folly
to
the
one
woman
that
he
wished
never
to
know
it
to
beautiful
proud
kathleen
the
idol
of
his
very
soul
for
whom
he
had
felt
all
the
passion
of
the
poet
plaint
i
love
you
that
is
all
life
holds
no
more
here
in
your
arms
i
have
no
other
world
where
is
the
mad
ambition
known
of
yore
all
fled
away
to
some
shore
and
lost
forever
yes
i
love
you
sweet
you
only
you
alone
my
heart
my
life
i
lay
a
meager
offering
at
your
feet
it
had
fallen
on
him
like
a
crushing
blow
the
knowledge
that
fedora
lived
when
he
had
been
duped
deceived
into
believing
that
she
was
dead
and
he
was
free
a
telegraphic
message
from
richmond
where
she
had
been
playing
had
summoned
him
to
her
but
when
he
reached
the
city
her
friends
told
him
she
was
dead
and
buried
they
showed
him
a
new
grave
in
the
beautiful
shades
of
romantic
hollywood
and
presented
him
with
a
long
bill
for
her
funeral
expenses
he
paid
it
without
a
murmur
and
could
not
help
feeling
glad
that
he
was
rid
of
his
terrible
incubus
he
did
not
dream
that
it
was
only
a
clever
plot
of
the
wicked
woman
to
extort
money
and
that
she
enjoyed
very
much
the
liberal
sum
he
had
handed
over
to
liquidate
the
expenses
of
her
interment
he
realized
it
all
now
saw
how
cruelly
fate
in
the
shape
of
the
heartless
fedora
had
used
him
and
with
a
bitter
groan
stared
his
cruel
destiny
in
the
face
fedora
his
false
wife
lived
she
had
parted
him
forever
from
his
beautiful
love
we
have
parted
i
have
loved
thee
but
for
me
all
hope
is
we
have
parted
and
forever
i
must
dream
of
thee
no
more
he
believed
that
kathleen
was
going
to
marry
teddy
darrell
as
alpine
hinted
but
he
was
not
so
sure
that
it
was
for
love
he
remembered
with
a
thrill
of
blended
rapture
and
despair
how
he
had
caught
kathleen
to
his
heart
this
morning
and
how
she
had
lain
passive
in
his
arms
at
first
she
did
not
repulse
me
at
first
he
thought
her
heart
throbbed
wildly
against
mine
and
she
lay
yielding
and
passive
in
the
utter
of
a
pure
woman
who
truly
loves
then
she
all
at
once
and
withdrew
herself
from
me
in
stinging
scorn
he
groaned
bitterly
at
the
memory
of
her
cruel
words
my
poor
proud
darling
if
she
would
but
have
listened
to
me
she
might
have
pitied
and
forgiven
me
he
thought
with
the
fluctuating
hopes
of
a
lover
heart
he
loved
kathleen
so
dearly
that
he
could
not
remain
angry
with
her
although
he
tried
to
do
so
in
his
heart
he
made
excuses
for
her
she
was
so
young
so
inexperienced
and
there
was
no
telling
what
lies
fedora
had
told
the
young
girl
i
will
punish
that
fiend
at
least
he
cried
starting
to
his
feet
no
more
squeamishness
shall
deter
me
from
seeking
a
divorce
and
i
shall
do
so
at
once
who
knows
but
that
kathleen
may
pity
me
may
relent
when
she
learns
all
that
i
have
suffered
chapter
xxxviii
i
have
come
for
my
diamonds
kathleen
said
to
the
jeweler
we
love
but
once
a
score
of
times
perchance
we
may
be
moved
in
fancy
fleeting
fashion
may
treasure
up
a
word
a
tone
or
glance
but
only
once
we
feel
the
soul
great
passion
wilcox
stone
was
charmed
when
she
heard
that
kathleen
was
to
marry
teddy
you
will
be
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
she
exclaimed
fondly
kissing
the
beautiful
girl
do
you
think
so
asked
kathleen
anxiously
proud
as
she
was
she
began
to
feel
frightened
at
what
she
had
done
she
found
her
wayward
heart
going
out
in
a
passion
of
regret
after
her
lost
lover
instead
of
leaning
fondly
on
her
accepted
one
she
was
alarmed
lest
it
should
always
be
so
and
so
she
timidly
asked
the
question
of
stone
do
you
think
so
stone
did
not
know
anything
of
that
lost
lover
did
not
guess
at
the
pain
in
the
young
girl
heart
she
honestly
believed
that
given
a
fair
opportunity
her
cousin
might
win
this
girl
pure
young
heart
so
she
encouraged
kathleen
to
look
forward
with
pleasure
to
her
marriage
and
i
should
let
it
be
soon
she
said
teddy
wishes
it
very
very
much
and
has
begged
me
to
plead
his
cause
oh
not
soon
cried
the
young
girl
in
alarm
why
not
my
dear
as
well
one
time
as
another
if
you
mean
to
marry
him
at
all
i
i
want
to
wait
until
helen
fox
comes
home
she
always
promised
to
be
my
you
can
write
to
helen
it
will
take
a
few
weeks
to
get
your
ready
and
by
then
she
can
come
home
the
big
dark
eyes
were
dilated
with
terror
i
should
not
like
to
helen
home
i
want
want
her
to
enjoy
her
trip
as
long
as
she
likes
faltered
kathleen
piteously
you
dear
timid
child
you
are
determined
to
make
teddy
wait
for
his
happiness
laughed
her
friend
well
never
mind
let
it
be
as
long
as
you
choose
only
you
will
not
mind
if
i
begin
to
get
your
ready
you
know
there
are
always
so
many
delays
a
burning
blush
stole
over
kathleen
pure
cheek
dear
stone
teddy
will
have
to
take
me
as
i
am
i
have
no
money
for
a
she
sighed
let
that
be
my
care
surely
i
may
make
a
wedding
gift
to
my
bride
let
it
be
as
simple
as
possible
then
dear
stone
answered
proud
kathleen
but
that
night
she
thought
of
the
necklace
she
had
left
with
golden
glitter
it
was
worth
five
thousand
dollars
and
they
had
advanced
her
one
thousand
on
it
perhaps
they
would
let
her
have
more
enough
to
buy
her
simple
wedding
garments
and
save
her
the
humiliation
of
accepting
them
from
stone
she
was
not
afraid
of
startling
them
the
story
of
her
return
had
leaked
out
the
boston
papers
had
given
it
publicity
so
she
went
in
stone
carriage
the
next
morning
to
the
great
jewelers
and
was
received
by
them
with
the
greatest
affability
they
overwhelmed
her
with
congratulations
on
her
resurrection
but
when
she
asked
about
her
diamond
necklace
they
told
her
an
amazing
story
ivan
belmont
had
come
to
them
soon
after
her
supposed
death
and
redeemed
the
necklace
by
the
payment
of
a
thousand
dollars
acting
he
claimed
under
the
instructions
of
his
mother
kathleen
gazed
at
him
in
astonishment
but
i
never
told
any
human
being
about
selling
the
diamonds
how
could
they
know
she
exclaimed
the
jewelers
were
as
much
puzzled
as
she
was
they
had
told
no
one
either
but
were
intending
to
acquaint
carew
with
the
truth
when
ivan
belmont
had
forestalled
them
by
presenting
himself
and
redeeming
the
necklace
they
advised
the
young
girl
to
go
to
carew
and
demand
the
return
of
the
jewels
they
did
not
doubt
that
she
would
be
glad
to
return
them
to
the
hapless
girl
they
had
stripped
of
everything
kathleen
eyes
were
flashing
with
anger
she
passionately
gave
the
order
to
drive
to
commonwealth
avenue
determined
to
demand
her
rights
when
jones
opened
the
door
to
the
imperious
young
beauty
his
face
lighted
with
instant
recognition
and
he
rejoiced
to
see
that
she
had
survived
the
horrors
of
that
dreadful
night
when
carew
had
cast
her
forth
to
die
but
he
remembered
the
orders
of
his
mistress
and
firmly
barred
her
entrance
carew
orders
was
not
to
admit
you
miss
if
you
came
again
he
said
resolutely
how
dare
she
exclaimed
kathleen
her
eyes
flashing
but
really
miss
you
know
right
for
you
to
follow
belmont
right
into
his
mother
house
remonstrated
jones
uneasily
and
as
she
stared
at
him
he
added
coaxingly
you
better
go
wait
down
there
at
the
corner
while
i
go
tell
belmont
that
you
want
him
why
what
do
you
mean
inquired
kathleen
sharply
why
ai
you
ivan
belmont
sweetheart
miss
how
dare
you
cried
the
girl
the
lightnings
of
her
eyes
seemed
almost
to
scorch
him
and
he
faltered
you
you
asked
for
him
that
night
when
you
came
before
and
carew
begging
your
pardon
miss
said
you
were
and
told
me
to
take
you
and
throw
you
in
the
street
so
it
was
you
that
did
it
the
girl
cried
sharply
no
miss
i
could
not
have
treated
a
dog
like
that
whispered
jones
glancing
over
his
shoulder
lest
he
be
overheard
then
he
told
her
how
much
he
had
pitied
her
and
how
he
had
placed
her
in
the
carriage
hoping
some
one
would
care
for
her
god
bless
you
for
your
pity
cried
the
girl
melted
almost
to
tears
and
in
her
turn
she
told
jones
who
she
really
was
and
that
when
she
had
asked
him
for
his
master
that
night
she
had
meant
her
father
not
knowing
that
he
was
dead
carew
told
you
a
willful
falsehood
she
said
angrily
then
paused
remembering
that
it
was
not
dignified
to
discuss
her
with
a
servant
no
matter
how
great
the
provocation
and
you
must
really
let
me
come
in
because
i
have
important
business
with
your
mistress
if
she
discharges
you
for
permitting
me
to
enter
i
will
get
my
friends
to
procure
you
another
situation
she
added
kindly
the
man
stood
aside
in
respectful
assent
thank
you
kindly
miss
carew
you
will
find
my
mistress
with
her
son
and
daughter
in
the
library
he
said
so
is
here
so
much
the
better
thought
kathleen
she
swept
with
an
aching
heart
down
the
superb
hall
of
her
old
home
jones
gazing
after
her
in
respectful
admiration
my
what
a
beauty
a
regular
goddess
he
ejaculated
and
breathed
a
silent
prayer
that
the
disinherited
daughter
might
yet
oust
these
heartless
people
out
of
her
old
home
and
come
into
her
own
kathleen
pale
with
passion
flung
back
the
library
curtains
with
a
shaking
hand
and
stood
revealed
to
the
inmates
ivan
belmont
had
read
with
horror
in
a
distant
city
the
marvelous
story
of
his
resurrection
and
return
trembling
with
fear
he
recalled
the
night
when
he
had
encountered
her
upon
the
steps
and
fled
away
from
her
believing
she
was
a
ghost
he
had
come
home
to
find
out
the
truth
and
was
even
now
listening
to
the
story
as
told
by
his
mother
and
sister
when
the
curtains
parted
flung
back
by
an
angry
hand
and
kathleen
beautiful
and
imperious
in
her
righteous
wrath
stood
revealed
to
their
astonished
eyes
a
gasp
of
astonishment
and
carew
rose
tall
stately
insolent
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
intrusion
she
demanded
i
told
jones
that
he
was
not
to
admit
the
likes
of
you
to
this
house
kathleen
lightning
glance
almost
transfixed
her
and
she
flushed
with
sudden
uneasiness
i
came
here
for
my
diamonds
give
them
to
me
and
i
will
go
the
young
girl
answered
defiantly
and
she
saw
ivan
belmont
whiten
to
a
deadly
pallor
diamonds
echoed
alpine
in
surprise
i
have
just
come
from
golden
glitter
said
kathleen
i
went
there
for
my
diamond
necklace
that
i
left
there
as
security
for
a
thousand
dollars
when
i
went
away
they
told
me
that
ivan
belmont
had
redeemed
the
necklace
for
his
mother
chapter
xxxix
kathleen
before
her
father
portrait
oh
that
those
lips
had
language
life
has
passed
with
me
but
roughly
since
i
heard
thee
last
those
lips
are
thine
thy
own
sweet
smile
i
see
the
same
that
oft
in
childhood
solaced
me
cowper
kathleen
declaration
was
almost
equal
to
the
bursting
of
a
in
the
handsome
library
of
the
carew
mansion
alpine
sprung
excitedly
to
her
feet
with
a
scream
of
surprise
and
fixed
her
dilated
blue
eyes
almost
wildly
upon
kathleen
pale
angry
face
her
mother
who
was
so
crafty
and
wicked
that
one
could
scarcely
charge
her
with
any
meanness
of
which
she
was
not
guilty
had
the
novel
sensation
of
being
falsely
accused
for
once
and
recoiled
with
a
nasty
and
indignant
disclaimer
from
her
insolent
and
threatening
position
toward
the
intruder
your
accusation
is
entirely
false
she
cried
hoarsely
but
it
was
upon
her
dissipated
son
that
kathleen
words
fell
with
the
most
crushing
power
this
slender
handsome
ivan
belmont
with
his
curls
and
seraphic
blue
eyes
was
a
cold
and
brutal
villain
who
utterly
belied
his
gentle
looks
he
had
all
his
mother
evil
traits
intensified
and
would
not
stop
at
murder
if
there
was
anything
to
be
gained
by
it
provided
he
was
not
to
be
found
out
he
was
a
coward
and
afraid
of
punishment
so
when
kathleen
made
her
bold
charge
against
him
and
he
realized
that
possible
detection
and
punishment
hung
over
his
head
his
coward
heart
gave
a
thump
as
if
it
would
burst
the
confines
of
his
narrow
chest
his
brain
reeled
his
fair
face
whitened
to
an
ashy
hue
his
limbs
trembled
beneath
him
as
he
clutched
the
back
of
a
chair
and
with
an
inarticulate
groan
of
feeble
denial
he
sunk
in
a
senseless
heap
upon
the
floor
ivan
is
dead
you
have
killed
him
with
your
false
words
shrieked
alpine
running
to
her
brother
carew
followed
and
they
knelt
down
over
ivan
exclaiming
and
lamenting
although
much
of
it
was
for
effect
for
they
did
not
waste
much
affection
on
their
black
sheep
kathleen
readily
comprehending
that
ivan
had
fainted
from
terror
curled
a
scornful
lip
and
turning
her
back
on
them
walked
across
the
room
to
where
a
portrait
of
her
dead
father
filled
a
panel
near
his
vincent
carew
had
been
a
singularly
handsome
and
imposing
gentleman
and
the
fine
artist
had
done
full
justice
to
his
noble
subject
the
dark
eyes
seemed
to
hold
the
very
fire
of
life
and
the
smiling
lips
almost
about
to
breathe
a
blessing
on
his
wronged
unhappy
orphan
child
as
kathleen
paused
in
front
of
the
magnificent
portrait
of
her
lost
father
the
hard
defiant
look
on
her
face
faded
as
if
by
magic
and
the
burning
light
of
her
large
oriental
dark
eyes
was
softened
by
a
rush
of
tears
almost
unconsciously
she
sunk
upon
her
knees
and
lifted
her
clasped
white
hands
appealingly
oh
father
dear
father
if
only
you
could
speak
to
me
if
only
you
could
tell
me
why
you
turned
against
your
unhappy
child
she
sighed
pathetically
it
was
a
sorrowful
picture
pathetic
enough
to
move
anything
but
the
heart
of
a
fiend
that
unhappy
girl
kneeling
there
in
tears
and
love
before
the
portrait
of
the
father
who
had
disinherited
her
and
left
her
to
want
and
misery
but
no
one
noticed
her
carew
and
her
daughter
were
busy
over
ivan
whose
swoon
was
a
deep
one
kathleen
raining
tears
fell
unnoticed
and
unpitied
save
by
the
great
eye
kathleen
heart
was
thrilling
with
all
the
pathos
expressed
in
cowper
beautiful
lines
oh
that
those
lips
had
language
life
has
passed
with
me
but
roughly
since
i
heard
thee
last
alas
how
cruel
it
was
to
think
that
this
dear
loving
father
had
turned
against
her
at
the
last
what
was
the
mystery
of
it
who
was
to
blame
not
you
papa
darling
moaned
the
girl
loyal
to
her
love
for
him
despite
everything
some
one
deceived
you
lied
to
you
made
you
believe
me
unworthy
of
your
love
i
will
not
lay
it
up
against
you
i
forgive
you
dear
because
you
were
always
so
good
and
loving
her
voice
broke
in
a
hard
sob
ending
with
but
oh
papa
papa
i
wish
you
could
come
back
from
the
grave
as
i
did
to
comfort
your
poor
girl
dear
lord
i
pray
thee
send
papa
back
to
me
had
heaven
answered
her
earnest
prayer
she
turned
wildly
toward
the
door
for
a
strange
voice
had
sounded
from
it
strange
yet
not
strange
for
it
had
a
tone
of
her
father
voice
in
it
although
louder
and
less
refined
than
vincent
carew
polished
tones
a
stranger
had
entered
the
library
a
tall
old
man
in
shabby
genteel
clothes
that
had
seen
much
service
and
wearing
a
long
gray
beard
that
matched
his
bushy
gray
curls
a
pair
of
smoky
glasses
hid
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
that
twinkled
with
curiosity
as
he
advanced
exclaiming
good
friends
what
the
matter
with
the
pretty
young
man
sick
ivan
belmont
had
at
that
moment
opened
his
eyes
on
the
faces
of
his
mother
and
sister
and
they
turned
languidly
on
the
while
carew
exclaimed
almost
ferociously
her
eyes
gleaming
like
blue
steel
who
are
you
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
intrusion
my
name
is
ben
carew
at
your
service
sister
carew
howdy
howdy
do
all
of
you
these
your
children
is
your
son
sick
much
replied
the
stranger
in
a
loud
familiar
tone
impertinent
muttered
the
lady
angrily
she
rose
to
her
feet
see
here
old
man
you
have
made
a
mistake
coming
here
certainly
i
know
you
and
have
no
business
with
you
so
clear
out
at
once
the
old
man
stood
his
ground
undismayed
by
the
virago
not
so
fast
not
so
fast
he
said
soothingly
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
now
ai
you
vincent
carew
widow
yes
she
snapped
and
i
vincent
carew
brother
ben
every
eye
in
the
room
turned
on
him
in
amazement
and
carew
exclaimed
my
husband
did
not
have
a
brother
at
all
no
brother
that
he
owned
maybe
but
an
older
brother
for
all
that
living
down
on
the
farm
poor
and
humble
so
maybe
his
proud
ambitious
brother
did
own
up
to
his
folks
about
ben
but
all
the
same
he
was
good
to
him
and
many
the
year
vince
sent
money
down
to
the
old
farm
to
help
out
when
the
crops
failed
and
prices
fell
on
live
stock
the
day
god
rest
his
soul
brother
ben
drew
his
hand
across
his
eyes
and
the
sound
of
suppressed
sobs
filled
the
room
my
husband
is
dead
if
he
was
any
relation
to
you
so
we
do
want
you
here
carew
said
to
him
brutally
he
started
back
as
if
she
had
struck
him
and
said
sadly
yes
i
heard
that
he
was
dead
and
i
wished
it
had
been
me
instead
i
ai
much
in
the
world
but
the
neighbors
said
you
ought
to
go
up
to
boston
and
get
your
share
of
your
property
vince
left
me
something
i
know
he
always
said
he
would
without
my
ever
asking
he
left
you
nothing
i
do
believe
in
you
anyway
you
an
impostor
i
sure
so
get
out
of
this
at
once
insisted
carew
but
he
did
not
stir
i
want
to
stay
and
visit
you
and
see
the
city
sights
he
pleaded
go
i
wo
have
you
here
you
are
a
disgrace
to
the
house
she
said
angrily
but
still
inwardly
appalled
for
in
spite
of
his
rough
looks
and
country
manners
he
was
wonderfully
like
the
dead
brother
he
claimed
in
voice
features
and
gesture
he
recalled
the
dead
he
stood
staring
in
pained
amazement
at
the
inhospitable
woman
when
suddenly
a
little
hand
stole
into
his
and
a
tearful
voice
murmured
uncle
ben
i
believe
in
you
and
i
love
you
for
you
are
so
like
my
dear
dead
papa
that
it
makes
my
heart
glad
just
to
see
and
hear
you
he
looked
down
into
the
face
of
a
lovely
girl
whose
lips
were
trembling
with
a
hushed
sob
and
exclaimed
why
this
is
vince
girl
i
know
by
the
favor
god
bless
you
honey
give
your
old
uncle
a
hug
and
he
put
his
honest
arms
around
her
and
pressed
the
curly
golden
head
against
his
breast
did
you
ever
see
such
impudence
mamma
kathleen
is
utterly
shameless
cried
alpine
in
a
high
key
of
disdain
you
let
me
stay
wo
you
sissy
dear
i
too
old
to
travel
straight
back
to
the
country
said
uncle
ben
coaxingly
while
he
turned
a
glance
of
meek
pleasure
and
triumph
on
the
others
alas
dear
uncle
this
is
not
my
home
i
can
not
invite
you
to
remain
much
as
i
wish
to
do
so
sighed
the
young
girl
chapter
xl
a
relative
as
i
came
through
the
valley
of
despair
as
i
came
through
the
valley
on
my
sight
more
awful
than
the
darkness
of
the
night
shone
glimpses
of
a
past
that
had
been
fair
wilcox
uncle
ben
carew
stared
in
surprise
at
his
niece
when
she
made
her
strange
declaration
but
she
continued
sadly
uncle
ben
you
must
not
blame
papa
for
his
seeming
cruelty
to
you
and
me
when
i
tell
you
all
but
but
dear
papa
when
he
died
disinherited
me
and
left
his
wealth
to
these
two
heartless
women
here
good
land
my
child
what
had
you
done
to
turn
vince
against
you
nothing
dear
uncle
but
i
believe
that
cunning
arts
were
employed
by
some
other
people
to
turn
my
father
heart
against
his
child
answered
kathleen
spiritedly
mamma
will
you
permit
kathleen
to
belittle
us
in
our
very
presence
and
in
our
own
house
exclaimed
alpine
angrily
kathleen
looked
at
her
who
stood
at
the
back
of
the
chair
into
which
she
had
assisted
the
pale
and
trembling
ivan
i
have
no
desire
to
remain
in
your
house
a
moment
longer
than
is
necessary
she
said
proudly
i
am
going
at
once
and
i
will
take
my
uncle
with
me
as
a
guest
in
my
friend
house
but
before
i
go
carew
please
give
me
my
diamond
necklace
there
is
some
mistake
i
know
nothing
about
your
diamonds
i
did
not
take
them
from
the
jewellers
answered
carew
angrily
but
there
was
such
a
ring
of
truth
in
her
voice
that
kathleen
believed
her
for
once
she
turned
to
alpine
perhaps
have
the
diamonds
she
said
interrogatively
i
have
i
thought
you
took
them
with
you
when
you
went
away
and
that
they
were
stolen
from
you
when
you
were
robbed
that
night
answered
alpine
earnestly
i
believe
you
said
kathleen
and
her
burning
glance
fell
on
ivan
belmont
as
he
cowered
before
her
in
his
seat
it
is
you
she
said
shaking
a
disdainful
finger
in
his
face
it
is
you
to
whom
i
must
look
for
my
jewels
where
are
they
what
have
you
done
with
them
he
tried
hard
to
stammer
a
weak
denial
of
all
knowledge
of
them
but
even
his
own
mother
and
sister
knew
that
he
was
lying
kathleen
great
flashing
eyes
surveyed
him
in
bitter
scorn
do
not
deny
it
i
can
see
that
you
are
speaking
falsely
she
said
you
can
not
deny
it
in
the
face
of
the
jewelers
assertion
perhaps
you
have
sold
them
to
get
money
to
go
on
with
your
dissipated
habits
listen
i
will
give
you
one
week
in
which
to
return
the
diamonds
or
four
thousand
dollars
in
lieu
of
them
she
paused
and
he
muttered
another
disclaimer
but
kathleen
persisted
i
can
not
afford
to
lose
the
small
fortune
that
is
all
that
remains
to
me
of
my
father
gifts
for
a
scruple
of
pity
to
those
who
have
been
pitiless
to
me
so
unless
you
return
the
jewels
or
their
value
in
a
week
time
i
shall
hand
you
over
to
the
law
with
a
heightened
color
she
took
the
old
man
arm
come
uncle
ben
let
us
go
she
said
and
swept
from
the
room
with
the
air
of
a
dethroned
princess
uncle
ben
following
humbly
in
her
wake
jones
let
her
out
with
an
air
of
distinct
approval
having
hovered
near
the
library
door
and
heard
all
that
transpired
within
kathleen
going
down
the
steps
with
her
shabby
newly
found
relative
came
face
to
face
with
a
man
going
up
ralph
chainey
a
start
on
either
side
a
cold
stiff
bow
then
kathleen
stepped
into
the
carriage
and
sunk
against
the
cushions
who
was
that
my
dear
inquired
her
uncle
observing
her
agitation
kathleen
stifled
a
sob
and
answered
it
was
ralph
chainey
the
great
actor
i
have
heard
of
him
but
what
made
you
feel
so
bad
at
seeing
him
honey
oh
uncle
i
used
to
love
him
and
expected
to
marry
him
but
alas
that
is
all
over
now
sighed
the
young
girl
and
there
came
into
her
mind
some
of
the
words
of
laura
jean
libbey
sweet
sad
song
lovers
once
but
strangers
now
though
pledged
by
many
a
tender
vow
still
i
give
the
world
to
be
all
that
i
was
once
to
thee
she
leaned
her
bright
head
lovingly
against
the
old
man
kindly
shoulder
and
sobbed
out
all
the
pain
in
her
heart
tell
me
all
about
it
dearie
said
the
old
farmer
gently
but
kathleen
heart
was
too
full
the
sight
of
her
handsome
perjured
lover
fascinating
ralph
chainey
was
too
much
for
her
her
tears
flowed
unrestrainedly
until
stone
house
was
reached
but
here
kathleen
uncle
decidedly
declined
her
invitation
to
enter
no
honey
not
just
now
i
shabby
looking
by
the
side
of
fine
city
folks
and
i
go
and
buy
me
some
better
clothes
a
new
hat
and
a
white
shirt
then
i
come
back
here
and
see
your
friend
and
yourself
he
replied
and
left
her
at
the
door
kathleen
told
her
friend
all
about
the
morning
events
and
received
her
very
sincere
sympathy
i
always
felt
that
those
carews
were
mean
especially
ivan
she
said
but
never
mind
dearie
when
your
uncle
comes
we
will
make
him
remain

a
long
visit

gentleman
called
in
the
morning
kathleen
had
a
great
shock
of
surprise
the
morning
papers
had
not
had
anything
so
exciting
to
chronicle
for
a
long
time
as
the
news
that
ralph
chainey
the
great
actor
and
the
idol
of
the
hour
had
been
secretly
married
to
a
beautiful
ballet
dancer
who
was
no
better
than
she
ought
to
be
and
that
he
had
publicly
applied
for
a
legal
divorce
to
free
him
from
his
galling
fetters
of
course
the
public
had
to
know
all
about
it
so
the
reporters
had
besieged
ralph
chainey
and
he
had
talked
freely
with
them
giving
them
all
his
sad
story
hoping
in
this
way
to
reach
the
obdurate
heart
of
beautiful
kathleen
surely
he
thought
when
she
heard
his
story
aright
when
she
heard
how
cruelly
he
had
been
betrayed
by
the
false
and
wicked
fedora
she
must
pity
and
pardon
her
unhappy
lover
ralph
chainey
was
not
much
of
a
praying
man
but
in
these
hours
of
awful
suspense
his
thoughts
took
almost
the
form
of
a
prayer
to
god
that
he
would
help
him
to
win
his
proud
young
love
who
had
scorned
him
in
such
disdainful
fashion
so
he
told
the
reporters
his
sad
story
in
his
most
eloquent
fashion
and
they
reproduced
it
in
glowing
paragraphs
denouncing
fedora
in
unmeasured
terms
for
her
sins
and
her
hypocrisy
and
hinting
at
the
beautiful
love
affair
that
had
been
broken
off
by
fedora
resurrection
from
the
grave
in
which
her
young
husband
believed
her
resting
they
did
not
tell
the
name
of
the
actor
beautiful
young
love
because
ralph
chainey
had
been
very
careful
not
to
tell
them
but
they
dwelt
eloquently
on
the
actor
love
for
her
and
his
hope
that
in
the
event
of
his
securing
a
divorce
she
would
become
his
worshiped
wife
kathleen
read
this
moving
story
with
heaving
bosom
and
dilated
eyes
and
while
she
was
yet
reading
it
the
bell
rang
and
a
package
was
handed
in
for
her
with
a
letter
ralph
chainey
forgetting
like
any
true
lover
his
pride
in
his
love
had
sent
to
kathleen
marked
copies
of
the
morning
papers
and
some
brief
pathetic
lines
oh
my
lost
love
ran
the
note
will
you
not
read
and
reading
pity
and
forgive
me
the
story
of
my
sorrows
oh
kathleen
they
say
that
you
are
pledged
to
wed
another
tell
me
that
it
is
not
so
my
one
great
hope
is
for
freedom
that
i
may
yet
have
the
hope
of
winning
you
life
without
that
hope
would
be
a
living
death
oh
kathleen
my
love
my
darling
pity
me
pity
yourself
you
have
not
learned
to
love
the
man
you
have
promised
to
marry
send
him
from
you
wait
a
little
my
darling
and
happiness
will
come
to
us
ralph
oh
my
poor
boy
my
poor
boy
sobbed
kathleen
she
forgot
herself
she
forgot
teddy
darrell
to
whom
she
had
promised
herself
and
she
kissed
ralph
chainey
letter
with
red
clinging
lips
as
if
it
had
been
his
handsome
face
why
did
i
not
listen
to
him
that
day
when
i
was
so
wild
with
jealousy
that
i
would
not
let
him
explain
she
cried
i
was
foolish
and
silly
it
is
a
wonder
that
he
could
ever
forgive
me
no
i
can
not
marry
teddy
now
but
will
he
release
me
from
my
promise
chapter
xlii
you
shall
not
marry
ralph
chainey
uncle
ben
cried
violently
adown
my
cheeks
in
silence
the
tears
came
flowing
free
and
oh
i
can
not
believe
it
that
thou
art
lost
to
me
heine
while
kathleen
was
still
weeping
over
ralph
chainey
appealing
letter
her
uncle
was
announced
she
dried
her
tears
and
went
down
to
welcome
the
old
man
stone
had
taken
the
children
out
for
the
morning
so
kathleen
had
a
long
interview
with
her
relative
he
was
so
much
like
her
dead
father
in
his
voice
and
looks
that
he
won
kathleen
heart
at
once
and
when
he
expressed
his
love
and
sympathy
for
her
in
moving
terms
the
unhappy
young
girl
gave
him
her
confidence
in
the
fullest
measure
she
told
him
the
story
of
her
young
life
from
the
beginning
her
cruelty
alpine
unkindness
and
ivan
attempts
at
courtship
which
she
had
repelled
with
scorn
then
her
indignant
voice
softened
as
she
murmured
over
the
story
of
her
happy
her
first
romantic
meeting
with
ralph
chainey
when
he
had
saved
her
life
and
her
later
acquaintance
with
him
down
to
the
moment
when
she
had
repulsed
him
with
scorn
and
in
a
fit
of
pique
engaged
herself
to
teddy
darrell
i
was
wrong
all
wrong
she
cried
and
gave
him
ralph
letter
to
read
benjamin
carew
listened
in
dead
silence
to
all
that
kathleen
told
him
of
the
young
actor
and
if
she
had
observed
him
closely
she
would
have
seen
that
his
brows
were
drawn
together
by
a
heavy
frown
once
or
twice
he
seemed
about
to
speak
to
her
but
checked
himself
abruptly
and
waited
kathleen
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
the
letter
cried
out
eagerly
do
you
not
see
that
i
was
wrong
to
judge
him
so
hardly
uncle
ben
looked
gravely
into
his
niece
face
and
answered
almost
sternly
no
you
were
right
for
appearances
were
against
him
but
dear
uncle
ben
all
that
is
explained
away
now
and
i
know
that
i
was
wrong
not
to
trust
my
lover
cried
the
girl
anxiously
but
he
answered
firmly
you
must
not
call
that
actor
your
lover
you
are
betrothed
to
mr
darrell
but
teddy
will
release
me
if
i
ask
him
would
you
wound
your
true
lover
so
cruelly
asked
the
old
man
almost
angrily
the
beautiful
dark
eyes
were
raised
to
his
swimming
in
tears
oh
how
unhappy
i
am
cried
poor
kathleen
i
am
the
most
wretched
girl
in
the
whole
world
every
one
is
against
me
the
old
man
did
not
answer
he
regarded
her
with
sad
troubled
eyes
through
his
smoky
glasses
you
too
uncle
ben
have
turned
against
me
just
when
i
thought
you
would
be
such
a
comfort
to
me
sobbed
his
niece
you
are
willful
and
unjust
my
child
if
you
expect
me
to
counsel
you
to
throw
over
your
lover
for
the
sake
of
a
man
who
has
a
wife
already
was
the
mild
reply
but
he
will
be
divorced
uncle
and
then
we
will
be
free
to
love
each
other
and
this
honorable
young
man
darrell
will
be
thrown
over
remorselessly
for
the
world
to
laugh
at
as
a
jilted
man
uncle
ben
i
can
explain
it
all
to
teddy
he
is
so
good
and
kind
he
will
forgive
me
he
would
not
want
to
marry
me
if
he
knew
that
i
loved
another
man
her
heart
thrilling
with
the
intensity
of
her
love
lent
fire
to
her
eyes
and
passion
to
her
voice
she
felt
that
it
would
be
a
sin
to
marry
teddy
with
her
heart
so
full
of
ralph
but
the
old
man
she
had
thought
so
kind
and
gentle
rose
up
angrily
and
caught
her
hand
you
are
mad
mad
girl
to
think
of
throwing
over
teddy
darrell
for
this
miserable
actor
you
shall
not
do
it
he
cried
violently
kathleen
tore
her
little
white
hand
from
his
clasp
in
haughty
amazement
you
have
no
right
to
control
my
actions
she
exclaimed
and
he
sunk
back
into
his
chair
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
true
true
she
heard
him
murmur
dejectedly
i
have
no
authority
over
my
brother
child
i
am
only
a
poor
humble
old
farmer
and
my
advice
is
not
desired
even
though
i
would
save
my
brother
only
child
from
wrecking
her
life
for
the
sake
of
an
unwise
love
so
be
it
i
will
go
now
a
sadder
wiser
old
man
the
pitiful
words
touched
the
girl
heart
melting
her
resentment
she
knelt
by
him
and
drew
the
hand
away
from
his
moist
eyes
murmuring
remorsefully
dear
uncle
forgive
me
i
was
hasty
and
am
sorry
that
i
wounded
you
what
would
you
have
me
do
to
marry
darrell
he
replied
firmly
how
can
i
she
moaned
wearily
at
least
say
nothing
to
any
one
of
your
change
of
mind
just
yet
kathleen
think
a
moment
ralph
chainey
may
not
get
his
divorce
then
were
it
not
better
child
for
you
not
to
compromise
yourself
by
declaring
your
love
for
him
perhaps
so
she
replied
dejectedly
then
you
promise
me
not
to
have
anything
to
say
to
ralph
chainey
until
the
divorce
is
secured
he
went
on
eagerly
i
promise
answered
the
girl
with
a
long
sigh
oh
she
thought
how
cold
and
cruel
old
people
are
surely
they
forget
they
were
ever
young
or
that
they
ever
loved
but
she
could
not
bear
to
grieve
the
poor
old
man
and
so
she
gave
him
her
promise
it
is
not
for
long
anyhow
she
consoled
herself
with
thinking
for
she
thought
it
could
not
be
long
before
ralph
secured
the
divorce
then
nothing
on
earth
shall
keep
us
apart
she
thought
blissfully
poor
teddy
he
will
soon
get
over
his
disappointment
and
love
some
other
girl
stone
came
in
at
this
juncture
and
kathleen
began
to
feel
quite
over
the
treachery
she
was
meditating
to
the
kind
lady
cousin
strangely
enough
after
she
had
cordially
welcomed
uncle
ben
carew
stone
plunged
into
the
subject
of
which
they
had
been
speaking
ralph
chainey
i
just
met
the
young
actor
she
said
and
congratulate
me
my
dear
for
he
likes
my
plot
and
i
am
to
write
him
a
play
wo
that
be
nice
for
he
will
make
it
famous
teddy
has
been
begging
me
to
create
a
part
in
it
for
him
and
to
ask
chainey
to
take
him
into
the
company
is
it
ridiculous
in
that
spoiled
boy
why
he
will
be
a
married
man
then
with
no
time
for
acting
kathleen
turned
the
subject
as
quickly
as
she
could
and
then
stone
devoted
herself
to
uncle
ben
persuading
him
to
become
her
guest
for
a
week
i
shall
be
delighted
to
have
you
and
teddy
will
be
glad
to
have
the
pleasure
of
showing
you
the
great
sights
of
boston
she
declared
so
it
was
arranged
and
darrell
manfully
fell
into
the
line
of
duty
escorting
uncle
ben
to
all
the
places
of
interest
in
the
city
feeling
fully
rewarded
for
all
his
trouble
by
the
murmured
thanks
of
his
beautiful
betrothed
so
three
days
passed
by
peacefully
and
although
kathleen
wept
bitter
tears
when
alone
over
the
dear
letter
her
uncle
had
forbidden
her
to
answer
she
managed
to
preserve
a
calm
aspect
before
her
friends
and
they
did
not
guess
how
her
heart
was
aching
with
its
secret
pain
it
grieved
teddy
that
she
seemed
to
shrink
from
him
a
little
but
he
kept
on
hoping
he
would
win
her
love
in
the
end
toward
the
middle
of
the
week
a
great
surprise
came
to
kathleen
the
letter
came
at
last
the
southern
relatives
so
long
deaf
to
her
loving
appeals
wrote
at
last
to
say
that
they
wanted
kathleen
to
come
and
live
with
them
they
were
rich
now
and
could
make
her
life
as
gay
and
luxurious
as
it
was
before
her
father
death
i
should
like
to
go
and
visit
them
my
heart
always
yearned
for
my
mother
people
kathleen
said
wistfully
uncle
ben
was
thoughtfully
perusing
the
letter
he
answered
i
will
take
you
to
them
my
dear
i
should
not
like
for
you
to
travel
alone
any
more
oh
how
good
you
are
dearest
uncle
cried
the
girl
gladly
but
do
you
see
they
want
me
to
come
right
away
they
want
me
to
be
there
at
the
celebration
of
my
grandmother
birthday
which
she
says
will
be
quite
an
event
in
the
franklyn
family
so
that
all
the
clan
will
be
gathered
at
the
old
homestead
and
i
can
see
all
of
them
we
can
start
for
richmond
her
uncle
answered
smilingly
chapter
xliii
the
old
housekeeper
story
i
can
not
rise
my
darling
my
breast
is
bleeding
see
i
stabbed
myself
thou
knowest
when
thou
wast
reft
from
me
heine
but
my
diamonds
uncle
ben
i
must
wait
here
for
them
you
know
said
kathleen
pooh
we
can
leave
that
affair
in
the
hands
of
a
lawyer
he
replied
carelessly
he
was
determined
that
nothing
should
hinder
this
opportune
trip
he
was
anxious
to
get
kathleen
away
from
boston
where
ralph
chainey
was
playing
every
night
to
crowded
houses
it
would
seem
as
if
uncle
ben
had
as
vigorous
a
dislike
for
actors
as
his
dead
brother
had
cherished
so
he
carefully
smoothed
away
all
her
objections
declaring
that
he
had
money
enough
to
take
them
both
to
richmond
and
that
she
could
repay
him
if
she
insisted
on
it
when
she
got
back
her
diamonds
i
wonder
if
papa
thought
when
he
gave
them
to
me
that
some
day
they
would
be
my
sole
little
fortune
sighed
the
young
girl
uncle
ben
did
not
answer
he
was
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
country
scenery
for
they
were
on
their
journey
now
kathleen
was
sitting
opposite
to
him
in
the
parlor
car
with
a
big
bouquet
of
roses
in
her
lap
the
gift
of
the
adoring
teddy
from
whom
she
had
just
parted
at
the
station
a
noble
young
fellow
uncle
ben
had
said
and
his
niece
answered
with
a
little
sigh
he
has
been
very
good
to
me
but
uncle
ben
he
is
called
the
greatest
flirt
in
boston
and
i
should
wonder
if
he
threw
me
over
at
any
time
for
a
newer
fancy
you
are
just
wishing
he
would
the
old
man
exclaimed
curtly
and
she
replied
only
by
a
roguish
laugh
the
train
rushed
on
and
on
through
the
wintry
landscape
and
both
of
them
grew
very
thoughtful
at
last
kathleen
touched
her
uncle
arm
with
a
timid
hand
uncle
ben
this
going
home
to
my
mother
people
makes
me
think
so
much
about
tell
me
did
you
ever
see
mamma
the
man
strong
arm
trembled
under
the
pressure
of
her
little
white
hand
and
he
answered
in
a
voice
that
was
hoarse
with
emotion
yes
i
knew
little
zaidee
poor
little
darling
was
she
as
beautiful
as
the
portrait
a
great
artist
made
of
her
there
is
one
that
hangs
in
my
room
at
my
old
home
it
is
beautiful
as
an
angel
and
papa
used
to
come
there
often
to
look
at
it
i
do
think
he
cared
for
my
to
know
how
often
he
came
zaidee
was
more
beautiful
than
the
portrait
answered
the
old
man
in
a
low
voice
he
pressed
her
little
hand
tenderly
as
it
rested
on
his
arm
and
said
tell
me
all
that
you
know
about
your
mother
my
child
they
have
told
me
that
she
died
by
her
own
hand
was
it
not
terrible
whispered
the
young
girl
with
paling
lips
terrible
he
echoed
with
emotion
and
then
she
asked
uncle
ben
who
was
to
blame
for
that
awful
tragedy
no
one
he
answered
sadly
zaidee
was
passionate
willful
jealous
she
became
madly
jealous
of
a
governess
a
young
widow
who
was
employed
in
the
house
to
teach
her
painting
and
music
before
poor
vincent
at
all
comprehended
the
situation
his
young
wife
in
a
fit
of
anger
destroyed
herself
by
thrusting
a
little
jeweled
dagger
into
her
breast
and
you
are
sure
no
one
was
to
blame
she
persisted
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
replied
perhaps
vince
was
to
blame
but
he
did
not
realize
it
then
poor
fellow
you
see
kathleen
he
worshipped
his
lovely
little
bride
and
it
grieved
him
that
she
was
lacking
in
certain
accomplishments
familiar
to
most
young
girls
in
his
cultured
set
to
remedy
this
he
employed
teachers
and
zaidee
learned
rapidly
until
he
passed
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
eyes
and
groaned
until
repeated
kathleen
quite
unexpected
by
him
for
she
was
probably
too
proud
to
betray
herself
to
him
zaidee
became
quite
jealous
of
that
pretty
young
widow
belmont
and
in
a
fit
of
madness
took
her
own
life
and
nearly
broke
her
husband
heart
he
married
the
young
widow
in
a
little
more
than
a
year
the
girl
replied
unable
to
resist
this
bitter
fling
at
her
dead
father
memory
he
winced
the
poor
old
man
as
she
spoke
thus
of
her
father
and
answered
almost
excusingly
he
was
so
wretched
and
belmont
comforted
him
she
too
had
loved
zaidee
and
shared
his
grief
with
him
that
was
how
she
made
herself
so
necessary
to
the
unhappy
man
the
fiend
broke
hissingly
from
kathleen
white
lips
he
turned
to
her
in
amazement
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
hoarsely
it
was
well
that
they
were
alone
in
the
car
for
kathleen
excitement
was
terrible
her
eyes
blazed
her
cheeks
paled
her
heart
beat
violently
against
her
side
uncle
ben
i
am
speaking
of
that
woman
who
so
unworthily
took
my
dead
mother
place
she
exclaimed
yes
she
is
a
fiend
to
pretend
that
she
loved
the
memory
of
the
woman
she
goaded
to
madness
perhaps
murdered
for
no
one
saw
my
poor
young
mother
drive
the
fatal
steel
into
her
heart
oh
god
what
deceit
what
treachery
he
grasped
her
wrist
with
steely
fingers
his
eyes
flashed
with
a
fire
akin
to
hers
and
he
whispered
hush
you
must
not
dare
accuse
so
you
drive
me
mad
oh
it
can
not
be
you
take
that
false
woman
part
then
uncle
ben
against
me
and
my
poor
young
mother
listen
then
let
me
tell
you
all
i
know
a
secret
i
kept
from
my
dead
father
because
i
believed
in
him
trusted
him
in
spite
of
the
servants
gossip
that
accused
him
of
complicity
in
his
young
wife
death
they
dared
the
hounds
accuse
brother
thus
he
breathed
fiercely
the
perspiration
starting
out
on
his
brow
his
strong
frame
trembling
yes
they
accused
him
answered
the
girl
do
not
take
it
so
hard
uncle
ben
he
was
innocent
i
know
but
that
fiendish
woman
played
her
part
to
perfection
she
made
my
mother
believe
that
vincent
carew
wished
her
out
of
the
way
so
that
he
might
wed
the
traitress
she
made
the
servants
believe
the
same
she
even
plotted
but
suddenly
the
girl
paused
with
clasped
hands
oh
uncle
dear
it
will
wound
you
if
i
mention
this
it
will
blacken
my
father
memory
in
your
eyes
and
i
always
loved
him
i
love
him
still
in
spite
of
what
he
has
done
to
me
and
i
ought
to
spare
him
go
on
kathleen
i
command
you
to
tell
me
everything
i
have
a
sacred
right
to
know
commanded
the
agitated
man
by
her
side
listen
then
dear
uncle
just
a
few
months
before
my
father
went
away
on
that
foreign
tour
from
which
he
never
returned
alive
i
received
a
message
from
an
old
woman
calling
me
to
her
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
i
went
taking
my
maid
with
me
in
a
secret
interview
that
followed
the
dying
woman
told
me
she
had
been
housekeeper
at
the
carew
mansion
in
my
mother
time
she
could
not
die
easy
without
revealing
to
me
a
secret
she
had
carried
untold
for
sixteen
years
that
secret
questioned
benjamin
carew
wildly
was
this
replied
the
girl
solemnly
on
the
day
of
the
tragedy
belmont
sought
the
housekeeper
pretending
to
be
overcome
with
grief
surprise
and
indignation
she
confided
to
the
woman
that
vincent
carew
had
been
making
secret
love
to
her
ever
since
she
first
entered
the
house
and
that
day
had
openly
declared
his
passion
begging
her
to
fly
with
him
to
europe
saying
that
his
ignorant
would
then
secure
a
divorce
and
he
could
then
marry
his
heart
best
love
with
tears
and
shame
belmont
owned
that
she
could
not
help
loving
her
handsome
employer
but
that
she
had
repulsed
him
with
scorn
and
resigned
her
situation
to
take
leave
immediately
belmont
was
too
much
overcome
to
explain
to
her
pupil
and
wished
the
housekeeper
to
tell
carew
the
whole
cause
of
her
leaving
my
god
groaned
the
old
man
at
kathleen
side
but
the
girl
hurried
on
with
blazing
eyes
the
housekeeper
after
the
fashion
of
most
servants
was
too
ready
to
believe
a
tale
of
scandal
and
to
excite
a
sensation
she
did
not
think
of
doubting
belmont
then
although
grave
doubts
assailed
her
after
the
tragedy
well
with
her
heart
on
fire
with
sympathy
for
her
wronged
mistress
she
did
not
think
for
a
moment
of
sparing
her
the
whole
cruel
truth
she
blurted
it
all
out
in
burning
words
and
advised
the
outraged
wife
to
forsake
her
monster
of
a
husband
and
return
to
her
own
relatives
within
the
hour
mamma
was
found
dead
chapter
xliv
grandmother
franklyn
i
dreamed
that
the
moon
looked
sadly
down
and
the
stars
with
a
troubled
ray
i
went
to
my
darling
home
the
town
lies
many
a
league
away
heine
kathleen
awed
voice
died
away
in
a
hushed
sob
and
in
the
grand
parlor
car
there
was
a
dead
silence
broken
only
by
the
clatter
of
the
as
they
rushed
over
the
glistening
steel
rails
old
benjamin
carew
crouched
silently
in
his
seat
with
clinched
hands
and
face
but
kathleen
could
see
that
he
was
pale
as
death
and
beads
of
dew
stood
on
his
forehead
and
around
his
lips
how
dearly
he
must
have
loved
his
my
unhappy
young
mother
she
thought
tenderly
and
just
then
his
hand
moved
and
sought
hers
clasping
it
fondly
but
with
a
grasp
as
cold
as
ice
oh
uncle
ben
i
ought
not
to
have
told
you
this
distressing
story
she
exclaimed
remorsefully
i
am
so
glad
to
think
that
i
never
told
papa
the
story
i
had
from
the
dying
housekeeper
it
would
have
been
so
cruel
for
him
to
know
that
the
woman
he
had
loved
and
trusted
had
plotted
away
the
life
of
my
mother
hush
child
you
drive
me
mad
this
is
too
cruel
groaned
the
old
man
he
leaned
his
gray
head
forward
on
the
seat
and
sobs
all
the
fiercer
for
being
suppressed
shook
his
slight
frame
kathleen
wept
too
and
altogether
it
was
a
sorrowful
journey
they
had
to
the
home
from
which
vincent
carew
had
carried
zaidee
his
fair
young
bride
to
meet
so
dark
a
fate
they
talked
but
little
for
a
heavy
cloud
of
trouble
hung
over
their
spirits
and
shadowed
the
future
and
the
young
girl
at
length
became
conscious
of
a
strange
dread
of
arriving
at
the
end
of
the
journey
so
long
ardently
desired
she
ascribed
it
to
sudden
timidity
at
meeting
strangers
she
did
not
dream
it
was
a
warning
presentiment
she
was
glad
that
the
cars
went
straight
through
lincoln
station
without
changing
she
could
not
bear
to
be
reminded
of
that
terrible
night
when
the
fingers
of
her
unknown
assailant
had
closed
stranglingly
about
her
white
throat
and
of
all
the
sorrows
that
had
followed
after
the
girl
so
young
and
tender
shuddered
as
with
an
ague
chill
wondering
how
she
had
lived
through
it
all
and
poor
daisy
lynn
poor
daisy
lynn
what
ever
became
of
that
unhappy
girl
she
wondered
pitifully
and
her
thoughts
wandered
to
the
girl
sad
love
story
how
sorrowful
it
is
to
go
mad
for
love
she
sighed
and
yet
how
sad
it
is
to
lose
one
love
and
remain
sane
and
conscious
in
the
midst
of
all
the
cruel
pain
oh
god
am
i
fated
to
lose
ralph
my
own
true
lover
how
shall
i
bear
to
give
my
hand
to
another
man
while
i
love
ralph
so
dearly
and
when
the
train
ran
into
the
station
at
richmond
she
was
weeping
bitter
burning
tears
for
her
love
ralph
from
whom
she
was
so
cruelly
parted
oh
the
pity
of
it
that
i
did
not
believe
in
him
that
day
that
i
sent
him
away
from
me
in
scorn
when
he
was
already
so
sorrowful
oh
ralph
my
darling
i
did
not
think
then
that
i
should
ever
be
suing
for
your
forgiveness
for
my
cruel
words
but
now
now
i
could
fall
at
your
feet
for
pity
and
pardon
sobbed
the
unhappy
young
girl
and
there
came
to
her
a
memory
of
some
verses
she
had
read
in
the
poems
of
mittie
point
davis
sweet
sad
verses
from
a
loving
heart
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
say
it
first
that
summer
evening
when
we
quarreled
so
about
some
trifle
you
had
magnified
men
are
so
harsh
you
know
i
said
some
bitter
words
of
hate
and
scorn
my
pride
was
up
my
temper
too
indeed
but
now
i
know
that
i
perhaps
was
wrong
and
dearest
i
am
brave
enough
to
plead
forgive
me
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
say
it
first
not
even
when
you
stayed
away
so
long
i
thought
i
could
be
proud
and
stubborn
too
i
did
not
know
that
love
could
be
so
strong
i
did
not
think
that
life
could
seem
so
long
without
the
love
i
reckless
cast
away
but
now
i
know
that
i
perhaps
was
wrong
and
dearest
i
am
brave
enough
to
say
forgive
me
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
say
it
first
that
summer
evening
when
we
quarreled
so
i
hated
you
i
know
you
hated
me
but
darling
that
seems
long
and
long
ago
so
long
and
i
oh
i
have
missed
you
so
while
you
perchance
have
shared
my
silent
pain
we
both
were
wrong
but
love
has
conquered
pride
forget
the
past
let
us
be
friends
again
forgive
me
richmond
shouted
the
conductor
and
kathleen
roused
with
a
start
from
her
sad
musings
and
drew
her
heavy
wraps
about
her
for
the
opening
of
the
car
door
had
let
in
a
blast
of
inclement
air
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
almost
twilight
and
a
long
carriage
ride
was
before
them
for
the
franklyns
had
written
that
they
lived
on
the
suburbs
of
richmond
but
would
send
a
carriage
to
meet
kathleen
sure
enough
a
close
carriage
was
in
waiting
the
driver
an
old
darky
who
seemed
surprised
and
even
displeased
that
he
had
two
passengers
instead
of
one
mistis
was
only
a
lady
he
observed
this
is
my
uncle
who
came
along
to
take
care
of
me
kathleen
answered
with
assumed
cheerfulness
for
her
heart
was
beating
with
a
strange
suspense
and
dread
the
old
negro
put
her
trunk
up
and
they
entered
the
carriage
and
set
out
on
a
long
ride
that
did
not
end
until
night
had
wrapped
its
sable
pall
of
gloom
around
the
earth
oh
uncle
how
glad
i
am
that
you
came
with
me
i
should
have
felt
so
frightened
all
alone
whispered
the
girl
nestling
close
to
her
relative
side
he
answered
only
by
a
silent
pressure
of
her
little
hand
he
had
been
strangely
moody
and
silent
ever
since
she
had
told
him
the
story
of
her
mother
tragic
death
the
dark
gloomy
exterior
of
the
old
brick
house
standing
alone
in
thick
shrubberied
grounds
was
not
inviting
but
presently
the
front
door
opened
and
a
gleam
of
light
stole
forth
in
its
ray
there
appeared
a
old
woman
huddled
in
a
gray
blanket
shawl
who
stood
shivering
in
the
hall
while
they
alighted
howdy
granddaughter
glad
to
see
you
she
gave
kathleen
a
cold
peck
on
the
cheek
and
peered
curiously
at
her
companion
who
this
i
war
expecting
anybody
but
you
my
dear
oh
your
uncle
sir
walk
right
in
both
of
you
to
the
parlor
folks
all
out
at
a
party
but
me
you
see
them
in
the
morning
she
ushered
them
into
a
prim
that
did
not
show
much
pretension
to
the
wealth
the
franklyns
had
written
they
were
possessed
of
but
kathleen
was
so
glad
of
the
great
glowing
fire
that
she
ran
to
it
and
held
her
numb
fingers
to
the
blaze
with
scarcely
a
glance
at
her
surroundings
uncle
ben
followed
her
with
a
strange
sinking
at
the
heart
his
impressions
of
franklyn
kathleen
grandmother
were
not
favorable
it
seemed
she
was
unprepossessing
in
her
looks
and
manners
and
she
certainly
regarded
him
in
the
light
of
an
interloper
she
had
not
extended
to
him
the
warm
welcome
that
northern
people
are
led
to
believe
is
characteristic
of
southern
hospitality
franklyn
pulled
out
a
little
table
on
which
was
arranged
a
tempting
little
supper
i
kept
oysters
and
coffee
warm
for
you
she
said
beamingly
now
lay
off
your
things
both
of
you
and
eat
before
they
get
cold
wo
you
i
am
so
tired
my
head
aches
i
do
think
i
can
swallow
a
mouthful
pleaded
kathleen
on
the
point
of
hysterical
tears
oh
why
had
she
come
she
was
alarmed
somehow
and
she
wondered
why
her
heart
had
failed
to
go
out
warmly
to
this
relative
as
she
had
expected
instead
she
experienced
fear
and
repulsion
but
the
old
woman
was
not
to
be
denied
she
almost
forced
her
reluctant
guests
to
swallow
some
of
the
food
and
then
she
bundled
them
off
to
their
rooms
with
an
alacrity
that
savored
of
anxiety
to
be
rid
of
their
company
you
must
be
dead
tired
and
wanting
to
rest
and
i
free
to
confess
that
it
long
past
my
usual
she
declared
uncle
ben
i
hope
you
will
rest
well
kathleen
said
kissing
the
old
man
with
quivering
lips
then
they
parted
each
to
their
separate
rooms
but
there
was
no
rest
for
uncle
ben
his
pillow
was
one
of
thorns
and
he
rose
and
paced
the
floor
at
midnight
restless
and
unhappy
my
heart
is
on
fire
oh
god
i
can
not
bear
this
pain
let
me
go
out
into
the
cold
dark
streets
and
walk
it
off
he
muttered
restlessly
and
hurried
into
his
clothes
i
suppose
i
can
easily
slip
out
of
this
old
ramshackle
house
without
arousing
any
one
he
thought
as
he
proceeded
to
open
the
door
but
he
recoiled
with
a
start
for
the
door
was
locked
on
the
outside
he
was
a
prisoner
in
this
strange
house

contemptuously
ivan

at

what

he
asked
insolently
you

with

coolness
good

what
will
you
do

cried
and
to
her
indignation
he
laughed
out

he

make
up

and

i

came
in
a
burst
of
rage
from
alpine
lips
and
her
mother
echoed
it
i
will
not
the
son
leaned
back
indolently
in
his
chair
not
a
whit
moved
by
their
anger
they
always
come
round
to
his
demands

would

you

yourselves

me

paltry
four
thousand

he
demanded
with
the
air
of
one
who
is
master
of
the
situation
they
glared
at
him
aghast
the
two
women
loved
money
passionately
it
made
them
almost
frantic
the
way
that
ivan
squandered
it
you
two
are
rolling
in

he
continued
and
yet
you
begrudge
a
poor
devil
of
a
son

a
few
thousand
to
get
him
out
of

the
listeners
shuddered
next
to
money
they
loved
good
repute
and
it
was
the
dread
of
their
lives
that
the
dissolute
ivan
would
bring
disgrace
upon
them
and
here
it
was
staring
them
in
the
face
the
penitentiary
ugh
we
have
spent
at
least
fifteen
thousand
dollars
on
you
since
we
came
into
this
fortune
groaned
alpine
and
what
you
ever
did
with
so
much
money
in
so
short
a
time
i
can
not
imagine
added
carew
fast
living
and
cards
laconically
replied
the
villain
they
looked
at
each
other
the
two
badgered
women
and
one
thought
was
in
the
mind
of
each
ivan
was
shameless
defiant
he
would
never
alter
his
evil
courses
and
if
he
went
on
like
this
and
they
had
to
supply
him
with
money
he
would
bankrupt
them
in
the
end
disgrace
would
come
to
them
sooner
or
later
through
this
black
sheep
alpine
turned
to
him
and
asked
curiously
how
did
you
find
out
that
kathleen
had
left
her
diamonds
at
the
jewelers
he
started
and
whitened
at
the
suddenness
of
the
question
but
answered
doggedly
that
is
my
own
secret
and
i
do
not
choose
to
disclose
it
neither
do
i
choose
to
help
you
out
of
the
scrape
you
have
brought
on
yourself
not
a
dollar
will
i
give
you
retorted
alpine
stung
to
defiance
and
rebellion
by
his
matchless
assurance
he
did
not
believe
her
and
smiled
as
he
answered
oh
yes
you
will
for
your
own
sake
my
dear
sister
perhaps
you
think
i
do
see
through
your
little
game
but
i
do
you
trying
to
marry
ralph
chainey
the
great
actor
although
he
does
not
care
a
pin
for
you
however
you
are
crafty
enough
to
hook
him
i
be
bound
only
he
certainly
would
not
look
at
you
again
if
kathleen
sent
your
only
brother
to
prison
for
stealing
her
diamonds
her
blue
eyes
blazed
on
him
with
the
steely
glare
of
a
bitter
hate
but
she
said
almost
as
if
begging
him
to
do
better
but
ivan
if
we
helped
you
out
of
this
you
would
be
into
some
new
scrape
directly
very
likely
he
replied
taking
insolent
pleasure
in
torturing
her
not
dreaming
she
would
really
turn
at
bay
but
alpine
was
reckless
desperate
ready
to
give
up
the
fierce
contest
with
an
untoward
fate
a
revengeful
longing
to
punish
ivan
for
his
misdeeds
even
at
the
bitterest
cost
to
herself
assailed
her
and
drove
everything
else
out
of
her
mind
her
eyes
flashed
her
face
grew
ashen
and
turning
to
her
mother
she
said
in
a
low
tense
voice
you
see
how
it
is
mamma
if
we
help
him
out
of
this
it
will
be
something
else
directly
how
can
we
bear
the
strain
for
years
do
what
we
will
he
will
beggar
and
disgrace
us
sooner
or
later
why
not
let
the
end
come
now
let
kathleen
send
him
to
prison
for
his
crime
and
we
we
can
live
it
down
as
best
we
may
every
word
fell
like
a
drop
of
ice
on
the
ingrate
heart
did
she
mean
it
would
they
desert
him
at
last
these
two
he
was
frightened
and
yet
incredulous
he
had
heard
and
read
and
believed
that
there
was
no
limit
to
the
love
and
forgiveness
of
a
mother
and
sister
heart
but
he
had
gone
too
far
in
his
insolent
assurance
and
to
his
terror
and
amazement
his
hour
of
reckoning
had
come
at
last
he
did
not
take
into
account
the
fact
that
he
did
not
have
a
good
woman
for
a
mother
his
excesses
had
turned
her
heart
against
him
and
to
his
horror
she
sided
with
alpine
angrily
discarding
him
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
she
said
bitterly
kathleen
may
send
you
to
prison
if
she
will
alpine
and
i
can
go
abroad
the
affair
will
soon
blow
over
and
people
will
forget
it
by
the
time
we
come
home
from
europe
he
dropped
his
and
descended
to
pleading
but
it
was
of
no
avail
he
saw
a
black
fate
lowering
over
him
from
which
there
seemed
no
escape
in
the
darkest
moment
a
clever
idea
came
to
him
if
i
could
only
escape
to
europe
the
whole
affair
would
be
over
for
i
would
never
come
back
but
alas
i
have
not
the
means
to
pay
my
passage
across
the
ocean
he
said
despondently
carew
caught
eagerly
at
the
offered
bait
if
you
go
and
never
return
i
will
furnish
you
the
means
she
said
i
swear
it
he
replied
and
left
the
house
presently
the
money
in
his
pocket
an
evil
sneering
smile
on
his
thin
lips
meanwhile
jones
had
said
to
miss
belmont
chainey
has
been
waiting
in
the
some
time
to
see
you
you
should
have
told
me
sooner
she
exclaimed
flashing
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
ralph
i
did
not
like
to
interrupt
you
miss
he
replied
respectfully
but
alpine
did
not
wait
to
hear
his
apology
she
hurriedly
sought
the
man
she
loved
chapter
xlvi
i
have
betrayed
myself
you
know
my
heart
now
it
matters
not
its
history
love
has
wings
like
lightning
swift
and
fatal
and
it
springs
like
a
wild
flower
where
it
is
least
expected
existing
whether
cherished
or
rejected
ralph
had
been
waiting
many
minutes
for
miss
belmont
but
he
had
forgotten
the
lapse
of
time
in
his
agitation
over
the
meeting
with
kathleen
and
he
rose
with
almost
a
start
to
meet
the
beautiful
blonde
who
hurried
to
him
with
both
hands
extended
in
rapturous
greeting
so
glad
she
murmured
with
the
loveliest
upward
glance
that
was
quite
lost
on
ralph
for
he
did
not
notice
it
but
exclaimed
i
had
quite
a
surprise
coming
in
just
now
i
met
miss
carew
so
she
has
repented
and
come
home
yes
and
no
it
was
only
a
formal
call
kathleen
is
so
proud
she
will
not
come
back
to
us
even
for
the
short
time
before
her
marriage
answered
alpine
she
sighed
and
he
echoed
it
but
it
was
of
kathleen
he
was
thinking
bonny
kathleen
alpine
guessed
it
and
bit
her
lips
then
plunged
into
an
animated
account
of
uncle
ben
carew
making
him
appear
in
the
most
ridiculous
light
he
was
an
impostor
of
course
mamma
is
quite
sure
that
my
never
had
a
brother
she
said
but
kathleen
believed
in
him
he
asked
yes
was
it
not
strange
she
should
let
herself
be
deceived
by
such
a
designing
schemer
she
carried
him
off
as
her
guest
at
mrs
stone
he
was
silent
wondering
if
kathleen
had
made
a
mistake
and
suddenly
alpine
said
sweetly
now
please
put
kathleen
out
of
your
mind
and
think
of
no
one
but
me
while
you
are
here
am
i
not
your
friend
and
have
i
some
claim
on
you
something
in
her
tone
startled
him
he
glanced
hurriedly
into
her
face
and
read
as
in
a
book
all
her
love
and
longing
her
eyes
met
his
and
held
them
as
if
fascinated
while
he
gazed
she
started
forward
and
caught
his
hand
in
hers
murmuring
hysterically
i
have
betrayed
myself
you
know
my
heart
now
oh
ralph
forgive
me
that
i
could
not
hide
my
love
for
you
forgive
me
and
try
to
love
me
a
little
in
return
good
heavens
cried
the
young
man
aghast
withdrawing
his
hand
hurriedly
from
her
grasp
and
looking
at
her
in
consternation
but
alpine
already
excited
and
unnerved
by
the
scene
with
her
brother
could
not
draw
back
now
having
betrayed
her
secret
she
cried
out
pleadingly
do
not
turn
from
me
so
angrily
is
it
a
crime
to
love
you
to
wish
for
your
love
she
recalled
him
to
the
fact
that
he
was
acting
rudely
that
he
ought
not
to
let
this
unhappy
girl
see
the
disgust
with
which
she
had
inspired
him
by
her
avowal
of
love
it
was
most
embarrassing
he
longed
to
get
away
for
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
he
was
utterly
abashed
and
obeying
a
sudden
impulse
sprung
to
his
feet
and
turned
to
the
door
miss
belmont
i
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
but
i
have
have
just
remembered
something
er
er
important
a
rehearsal
will
you
pardon
my
haste
he
stammered
like
a
bashful
and
instantly
fled
the
scene
leaving
alpine
to
fling
herself
upon
a
sofa
in
a
burst
of
hysterical
tears
oh
why
did
i
betray
my
bitter
secret
i
was
mad
mad
and
now
i
have
driven
him
from
my
side
forever
by
my
imprudence
she
sobbed
in
the
wildest
as
she
lay
there
sobbing
her
hatred
and
jealousy
of
her
beautiful
grew
stronger
than
ever
it
was
for
love
of
kathleen
that
ralph
chainey
had
turned
from
her
when
she
had
humbled
herself
to
him
and
sued
for
his
love
some
touching
verses
rang
in
sad
melody
through
her
brain
ah
dearest
had
some
happier
chance
the
force
of
fateful
circumstance
some
burning
thrill
of
love
divine
but
touched
your
heart
and
made
you
mine
how
had
my
pulses
gladly
beat
with
love
deep
rapture
wildly
sweet
how
had
my
life
so
crowned
put
forth
life
proudest
strength
to
prove
its
worth
for
love
of
you
but
cruel
fate
that
shapes
our
ends
dark
doom
that
poet
love
attends
the
fate
unhappy
petrarch
sung
in
fair
italia
burning
tongue
such
fate
as
reckless
tears
apart
the
tendrils
of
the
breaking
heart
from
every
prop
where
it
would
twine
such
cruel
fate
alas
is
mine
for
love
of
you
so
when
my
grave
is
green
to
see
you
will
not
let
them
say
of
me
her
talent
was
a
wasted
power
her
life
has
failed
of
fruit
and
flower
for
you
will
know
the
hopeless
pain
that
palsied
heart
and
hand
and
brain
will
know
that
life
has
failed
alone
because
a
blight
was
on
it
thrown
for
love
of
you
she
dashed
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
sat
up
the
picture
of
shame
and
despair
i
could
have
been
a
better
woman
if
he
had
been
kind
to
me
if
he
would
but
have
promised
to
try
to
love
me
she
muttered
angrily
but
how
fast
he
hurried
away
as
if
he
despised
me
how
i
wish
i
could
hate
him
in
return
hate
him
as
i
hate
his
love
it
is
for
he
scorns
me
oh
god
for
vengeance
on
them
both

a
terrible
crime
deep
and
dark
the
flowing
river
close
to
the
feet
like
a
serpent
glides
many
a
secret
lost
forever
the
deep
and
beautiful
water
hides
our
kathleen
did
not
share
the
wakefulness
of
her
relative
on
the
contrary
a
strange
drowsiness
stole
over
her
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
shabby
little
bedroom
to
which
franklyn
conducted
her
with
such
alacrity
get
a
good
rest
that
a
dear
and
in
the
morning
you
shall
see
them
all
she
said
wheedlingly
and
giving
kathleen
a
cold
little
kiss
on
the
cheek
she
retreated
leaving
her
guest
alone
kathleen
flung
off
her
clothes
shivering
in
the
fireless
room
slipped
into
her
gown
and
crept
between
the
sheets
murmuring
over
her
prayers
in
the
bed
because
it
was
too
cold
outside
then
with
the
tears
still
wet
on
her
lashes
she
fell
into
a
heavy
slumber
presently
the
door
opened
again
noiselessly
and
the
old
woman
head
was
thrust
inside
the
room
she
gave
a
low
grunt
of
satisfaction
as
she
heard
the
deep
breathing
of
kathleen
and
closed
the
door
silence
again
in
the
old
house
but
if
any
one
had
been
listening
they
would
have
heard
outside
in
the
chilly
night
the
stamp
of
the
horses
that
had
brought
the
uncle
and
niece
to
this
place
the
cab
was
waiting
yet
why
and
for
whom
the
night
was
intensely
dark
it
was
freezing
cold
and
the
driver
did
not
have
to
wait
long
the
door
opened
softly
in
a
little
while
and
a
man
and
a
woman
stole
out
bearing
between
them
a
figure
wrapped
up
in
a
long
cloak
they
pushed
their
dead
or
living
burden
whichever
it
was
into
the
cab
entered
themselves
and
were
driven
a
long
distance
until
the
low
murmur
of
a
river
rushing
between
its
banks
was
distinctly
heard
at
a
quiet
unfrequented
spot
they
came
to
a
stop
the
two
people
got
out
again
and
carried
their
burden
to
the
then
there
was
a
thud
a
splash
and
then
they
turned
away
their
arms
empty
of
the
load
they
had
brought
in
the
silence
and
darkness
of
the
wintry
night
a
terrible
crime
had
been
committed
alas
poor
kathleen
poor
the
sport
of
a
most
malignant
fate
heaven
help
thee
now
drifting
upon
the
dark
mysterious
waves
of
the
gloomy
river
beneath
the
pall
of
the
heavens
unlighted
by
either
moon
or
star
meanwhile
the
old
man
locked
into
his
room
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
was
bending
all
his
feeble
efforts
toward
releasing
himself
he
feared
to
make
an
outcry
for
he
comprehended
instinctively
that
treachery
lurked
in
the
air
of
the
old
house
with
its
forbidding
mistress
treachery
and
danger
to
himself
and
helpless
kathleen
he
sunk
back
helplessly
upon
the
bed
at
first
shaken
and
unnerved
by
his
terrible
suspicions
sweeping
his
hand
across
his
brow
he
muttered
my
door
was
locked
on
the
outside
by
design
to
bar
me
out
from
my
child
my
bonny
kathleen
what
have
they
done
to
her
or
what
are
they
going
to
do
he
crept
cautiously
to
the
window
and
pushed
up
the
sash
horrors
it
was
barred
across
with
iron
as
closely
as
a
prison
and
again
he
fell
to
raving
of
treachery
and
danger
that
woman
was
not
franklyn
i
did
not
believe
at
first
that
it
could
be
poor
zaidee
mother
she
could
not
have
changed
so
much
in
seventeen
years
i
knew
yet
i
could
not
speak
out
then
lest
i
betray
myself
i
thought
i
would
wait
for
the
developments
of
alas
it
was
a
fatal
resolve
we
were
decoyed
here
by
the
trick
of
some
deadly
enemy
and
every
moment
that
i
remain
locked
up
here
kathleen
is
in
the
most
deadly
peril
god
in
heaven
help
me
to
escape
that
i
may
succor
my
poor
child
desperate
with
fears
for
kathleen
he
threw
himself
against
the
door
and
shook
it
with
all
his
might
the
sounds
rang
through
the
house
but
no
one
came
to
release
him
he
shrieked
aloud
but
no
voice
replied
to
his
frantic
calls
in
his
misery
an
awful
suspicion
had
come
to
him
he
remembered
kathleen
threat
to
ivan
belmont
that
she
would
send
him
to
prison
unless
she
received
the
value
of
her
stolen
diamonds
what
if
that
villain
had
laid
a
deadly
trap
to
decoy
kathleen
to
this
place
and
murder
her
to
save
himself
the
payment
of
that
pitiful
sum
this
affair
looked
like
it
perhaps
she
was
already
murdered
his
beautiful
kathleen
that
he
loved
so
dearly
and
whom
he
had
brought
here
in
his
mistaken
eagerness
to
get
her
away
from
boston
searching
frantically
about
he
perceived
with
joy
an
old
rusty
poker
beneath
the
iron
fender
of
the
he
seized
it
and
with
the
strength
of
a
madman
wrenched
the
lock
from
the
door
it
flew
open
he
was
free
then
ensued
the
most
piteous
search
the
world
ever
knew
the
old
frantic
search
for
missing
kathleen
it
was
all
in
vain
the
old
house
was
empty
the
girl
was
gone
the
old
woman
was
gone
and
the
as
it
sighed
around
the
gables
of
the
lonely
old
house
did
not
whisper
to
him
of
the
awful
secret
the
river
hid
chapter
xlviii
kathleen
has
mysteriously
disappeared
is
strange
to
think
if
we
could
fling
aside
the
mask
and
mantle
that
love
wears
from
pride
how
much
would
be
we
now
so
little
guess
deep
in
each
heart
undreamed
unsought
recess
ralph
chainey
waited
in
cruel
suspense
for
an
answer
to
the
appealing
letter
he
had
sent
to
kathleen
but
long
days
passed
and
no
letter
came
from
his

then
he
saw
the
announcement
in
a
morning
paper
that
she
had
gone
away
with
her
uncle
to
visit
her
southern
relatives
cruel
girl
she
has
gone
without
a
word
or
sign
she
hates
me
indeed
and
will
never
forgive
my
boyhood
folly
he
groaned
despairingly
the
first
shock
of
pain
and
disappointment
was
so
great
that
he
could
scarcely
bear
it
he
thought
vaguely
of
suicide
wondered
which
would
be
the
easier
way
out
of
life
the
dagger
the
bullet
poison
or
the
river
shakespeare
words
came
to
him
oh
that
the
everlasting
had
not
fixed
his
canon
oh
god
oh
god
how
weary
stale
flat
and
unprofitable
seem
to
me
all
the
uses
of
this
world
he
got
up
suddenly
and
shook
himself
with
fierce
god
forgive
me
for
these
wild
thoughts
he
cried
no
i
can
not
be
such
a
coward
he
is
a
coward
who
takes
his
own
life
because
he
can
not
bear
its
ills
i
must
remember
that
i
have
a
dear
little
mother
to
live
for
even
though
the
hope
of
love
and
happiness
be
gone
forever
but
life
was
cruel
he
longed
to
get
away
somewhere
far
away
from
the
place
where
everything
breathed
of
his
cruel
beautiful
love
and
he
decided
that
as
soon
as
he
secured
his
divorce
he
would
go
abroad
and
seek
forgetfulness
in
constant
travel
meanwhile
a
sorrowful
little
note
came
to
him
from
alpine
praying
him
to
forget
her
folly
or
at
least
to
keep
it
secret
i
should
die
of
shame
if
i
believed
any
one
knew
but
you
she
wrote
but
you
are
so
good
and
great
you
can
forgive
me
perhaps
things
like
that
have
happened
to
you
before
i
should
not
wonder
then
do
not
exclude
me
from
your
friendship
i
pray
you
forget
that
one
mad
moment
and
think
kindly
of
me
as
you
did
before
your
true
friend
alpine
with
the
letter
was
a
little
perfumed
sheet
on
which
were
written
some
sweet
sad
verses
that
touched
his
heart
the
farewell
ah
yes
i
can
bid
you
farewell
and
forever
no
more
will
i
think
thy
affection
to
claim
and
hope
for
thy
heart
love
again
will
i
never
since
now
i
have
found
that
it
lives
but
in
name
that
dream
of
my
life
i
too
fondly
have
cherished
till
now
i
have
bitterly
wept
my
woe
and
hope
from
my
bosom
has
withered
and
perished
when
made
the
cold
blight
of
desertion
to
know
my
way
is
all
dark
as
it
spreads
out
before
me
and
gloomy
and
sad
i
must
wander
alone
fain
wishing
for
some
fatal
blast
to
sweep
me
to
still
my
heart
beating
and
silence
its
moan
but
far
as
i
wander
the
wide
world
will
dream
not
the
wounds
in
my
heart
that
i
strive
to
conceal
and
those
who
best
know
me
and
love
me
will
dream
not
the
deep
crushing
sorrow
alone
that
i
feel
i
can
not
forget
thee
i
shall
wander
thy
image
as
bright
shall
abide
with
me
yet
and
though
i
may
roam
like
the
condor
and
though
thou
hast
bid
me
i
can
not
forget
go
thou
and
be
happy
my
last
fondest
blessing
shall
be
upon
him
that
i
once
loved
so
well
and
though
my
heart
break
at
the
thought
so
distressing
oh
go
and
be
happy
i
bid
thee
farewell
ralph
read
the
verses
penned
in
alpine
hand
with
deep
emotion
but
it
was
not
of
it
was
of
another
he
thought
the
sweet
sorrowful
strain
seemed
to
express
his
feelings
toward
his
lost
kathleen
lost
to
me
forever
he
sighed
bitterly
teddy
darrell
the
boyish
flirt
who
roves
from
one
beauty
to
another
like
a
butterfly
from
flower
to
flower
will
win
and
wear
the
peerless
rose
beautiful
kathleen
he
is
not
worthy
of
her
for
he
has
frittered
his
heart
away
in
a
score
of
passions
while
mine
has
aye
been
true
to
her
since
first
we
met
he
could
not
help
hating
the
fortunate
teddy
because
he
had
won
kathleen
and
teddy
who
was
a
versatile
youth
envied
him
in
his
turn
his
genius
and
his
fame
and
was
fired
with
the
desire
of
becoming
a
great
actor
he
was
always
dabbling
at
some
new
fad
but
stone
who
understood
him
thoroughly
declared
that
teddy
would
never
accomplish
anything
great
unless
he
should
lose
his
fortune
and
have
to
work
for
his
living
it
was
lonesome
for
teddy
the
first
few
days
after
kathleen
went
away
and
he
was
fain
to
console
himself
with
some
of
his
old
sweethearts
while
pursuing
this
diversion
with
the
usual
alacrity
of
a
young
man
whose
sweetheart
is
away
he
met
a
new
girl
who
proved
quite
a
bonanza
as
he
confided
to
stone
saw
her
at
maude
sylvester
by
the
way

is
having
quite
a
success

you
know

was
saying
this

is
a
real
daisy
and
suits
me
down
to

ground
talks
about
going
on
the
stage
kathleen
would
be
jealous
if
she
could
hear
how
you
run
on
his
cousin
exclaimed
warningly
not
a
bit
he
replied
his
frank
brow
clouding
with
vexation
to
tell
you
the
truth
carrie
i
do
believe
she
loves
me
in
the
least
it
only
gratitude
that
made
her
promise
to
be
mine
only
think
now
carrie
she
has
been
gone
three
days
and
not
one
line
to
me
although
i
written
two
letters
a
day
why
do
you
know
that
week
i
went
to
new
york
i
began
a
letter
to
her
as
soon
as
the
train
started
and
by
jove
i
mailed
it
at
the
first
station
i
ashamed
to
think
of
all
the
spoony
letters
i
wrote
that
girl
in
one
week
and
one
little
note
in
return
for
all
stone
could
not
help
laughing
at
his
air
well
never
mind
you
have
a
special
talent
for
you
know
and
kathleen
detests
writing
she
told
me
so
that
accounts
for
her
failure
to
write
oftener
she
began
soothingly
but
just
then
the
rang
a
resounding
peal
and
she
started
up
in
dismay
what
a
deafening
ring
maybe
that
the
postman
now
no
it
is
too
early
for
what
is
it
mary
oh
a
telegram
open
it
please
teddy
those
things
always
startle
us
women
folks
so
his
handsome
face
paled
to
an
ashen
hue
and
his
lips
trembled
as
he
read
it
was
a
telegram
from
richmond
and
contained
these
startling
words
ask
darrell
to
join
me
here
at
once
if
possible
kathleen
has
mysteriously
disappeared
under
circumstances
that
hint
of
foul
play
benjamin
carew
kathleen
gone
oh
heaven
my
little
darling
groaned
the
young
man
forgetting
all
about
his
new
fancy
in
real
grief
and
dismay
stone
burst
into
tears
and
for
a
few
minutes
one
could
not
comfort
the
other
but
women
are
more
than
men
and
stone
who
knew
nothing
about
ivan
belmont
and
the
diamonds
quickly
leaped
to
a
conclusion
those
asylum
people
the
fools
have
captured
her
again
and
carried
her
off
to
their
old
prison
she
exclaimed
brightening
and
wiping
away
her
tears
cheer
up
teddy
no
harm
can
happen
your
little
sweetheart
except
another
detention
at
the
lunatic
asylum
and
you
and
her
uncle
can
soon
have
her
out
when
you
find
out
exactly
where
the
place
is
situated
her
idea
was
so
plausible
that
teddy
brightened
up
under
its
influence
and
prepared
to
take
leave
i
must
go
on
the
first
train
he
said
as
he
kissed
his
cousin
after
the
affectionate
way
he
affected
with
all
his
female
relatives
who
had
the
slightest
claim
to
good
looks
the
news
spread
rapidly
and
helen
fox
arriving
the
next
day
from
europe
was
shocked
at
the
calamity
that
had
overtaken
her
friend
the
news
that
kathleen
lived
had
thrilled
her
with
joy
and
hastened
her
return
from
abroad
that
was
not
all
the
news
that
shocked
her
for
she
soon
became
acquainted
with
ralph
chainey
pathetic
story
helen
was
a
frank
girl
but
she
could
not
understand
the
strange
turn
matters
had
taken
during
her
absence
the
next
day
after
her
return
she
told
her
brother
george
to
bring
ralph
chainey
home
to
luncheon
i
have
been
dying
to
see
you
ever
since
i
got
back
she
said
to
him
frankly
her
blue
eyes
beaming
with
the
kindness
of
her
heart
now
tell
me
luncheon
was
over
and
they
were
alone
in
the
cozy
library
together
helen
looked
sympathetically
at
the
unhappy
young
man
remembering
how
such
a
little
time
ago
she
had
plotted
in
her
loving
fashion
to
bring
about
a
match
between
him
and
her
bonny
kathleen
he
comprehended
her
sympathy
and
opened
his
full
heart
to
her
with
all
its
pain
and
anguish
chapter
xlix
the
franklyns
at
last
i
knew
by
the
smoke
that
so
gracefully
curled
above
the
green
elms
that
a
cottage
was
near
and
i
said
if
there
peace
to
be
found
in
the
world
a
heart
that
was
humble
might
hope
for
it
here
thomas
moore
river
cottage
was
one
of
the
prettiest
spots
on
the
banks
of
the
james
and
so
far
away
from
any
other
habitation
that
it
was
lonely
to
the
last
degree
yet
embowered
in
trees
and
vines
and
flowers
and
lulled
by
the
murmuring
voice
of
the
majestic
river
its
inhabitants
were
so
happy
and
content
that
they
did
not
pine
for
the
world
that
at
a
little
distance
surged
busily
around
them
the
family
consisted
of
but
two
franklyn
a
lovely
old
woman
somewhat
past
fifty
and
her
grandson
a
youth
of
years
here
at
river
cottage
they
lived
quietly
together
on
a
modest
competency
the
woman
with
her
sad
face
and
dreamy
eyes
absorbed
altogether
in
dreams
of
her
past
and
in
tender
care
for
chester
the
boy
under
whose
crown
of
yellow
curls
throbbed
the
restless
brain
of
a
genius
that
was
beginning
to
express
itself
in
dainty
bits
of
verse
the
first
callow
flights
of
ambition
the
boy
was
restless
genius
was
beginning
to
burn
sometimes
he
walked
the
floor
for
hours
while
the
midnight
oil
burned
on
his
study
table
at
times
he
loved
to
walk
on
the
banks
of
the
river
setting
his
beautiful
thoughts
to
the
music
of
its
melodious
rhythm
on
that
dark
cold
night
chester
had
wandered
from
the
cottage
porch
down
to
the
river
edge
and
so
he
caught
with
startled
ears
the
sound
of
that
sullen
splash
into
the
waves
caught
the
sound
and
scarce
a
minute
later
saw
with
keen
eyes
strained
into
the
gloom
a
body
floating
in
the
river
past
the
cottage
a
suicide
he
muttered
in
a
voice
of
horror
the
next
minute
he
threw
off
his
coat
and
shoes
and
plunged
into
the
stream
it
was
a
brave
deed
and
sometimes
in
the
anguished
months
that
came
afterward
chester
wondered
if
he
would
have
risked
so
much
could
he
but
have
known
all
that
was
to
follow
on
this
night
the
full
draught
of
life
chalice
filled
to
the
brim
with
love
and
pain
that
he
was
to
quaff
but
no
presentiment
of
the
future
came
to
him
now
as
he
struggled
in
the
almost
freezing
waves
until
he
caught
and
held
the
form
drifting
rapidly
from
him
and
by
almost
superhuman
efforts
drew
it
with
him
to
the
shore
franklyn
always
dwelt
with
loving
pride
on
that
night
when
the
cottage
door
was
pushed
open
and
her
brave
boy
staggered
in
with
his
unconscious
burden
both
of
them
dripping
water
upon
her
pretty
ingrain
carpet
and
chester
faltered
weakly
i
i
have
saved
some
one
from
the
river
then
he
fell
upon
the
floor
too
exhausted
to
utter
another
word
franklyn
did
not
look
at
the
stranger
at
first
she
hastened
to
revive
chester
by
pouring
some
wine
between
his
pale
lips
and
chattering
teeth
as
soon
as
he
could
he
sat
up
saying
anxiously
there
grandma
i
all
right
see
about
the
woman
please
and
then
they
found
that
the
woman
he
had
rescued
was
a
young
girl
the
most
beautiful
young
creature
they
had
ever
beheld
when
they
had
used
some
little
effort
at
restoring
her
to
consciousness
she
opened
on
their
faces
a
pair
of
large
dark
wondering
eyes
at
whose
gaze
chester
franklyn
romantic
heart
leaped
up
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
he
stooped
down
almost
unconsciously
and
pressed
his
lips
to
her
icy
little
hand
carried
out
of
himself
by
some
strange
delicious
emotion
he
could
not
resist
tears
started
to
franklyn
eyes
as
she
busied
herself
about
the
patient
who
did
not
answer
one
word
when
she
spoke
to
her
but
lay
watching
her
face
with
dazed
uncomprehending
eyes
the
good
lady
sent
chester
up
to
his
room
to
put
on
dry
garments
and
brought
some
of
her
own
for
the
strange
young
girl
thrown
upon
her
care
she
supposed
that
this
was
an
attempted
suicide
and
wondered
what
terrible
sorrow
had
driven
this
beautiful
young
girl
to
she
ventured
to
ask
the
patient
the
question
but
kathleen
seemed
dazed
as
yet
and
did
not
comprehend
anything
very
clearly
she
answered
to
every
question
that
was
asked
her
a
feeble
i
do
know
i
must
wait
until
she
gets
better
was
her
thought
and
she
put
kathleen
to
bed
carefully
spreading
out
her
long
gold
curls
over
the
pillow
to
dry
soon
the
girl
fell
asleep
and
then
franklyn
turned
down
the
lamp
and
slipped
away
to
ask
chester
all
about
it
he
could
tell
her
nothing
but
that
he
had
heard
the
dull
thud
of
her
body
striking
the
water
and
that
he
jumped
into
the
river
to
save
her
he
believed
it
was
a
suicide
as
he
had
heard
no
sound
or
cry
some
poor
girl
perhaps
who
can
not
make
an
honest
living
and
has
sought
death
in
her
despair
he
said
and
the
gentle
lady
agreed
with
him
we
will
keep
her
here
until
she
gets
well
and
strong
and
then
we
will
see
how
we
can
help
her
out
of
her
trouble
she
added
kindly
yes
we
will
take
care
of
her
cried
chester
franklyn
eagerly
it
may
be
she
has
some
deadly
enemies
from
whom
she
sought
to
escape
in
that
terrible
fashion
we
will
say
nothing
of
her
being
here
until
she
herself
tells
us
what
to
do
when
the
morrow
dawned
kathleen
was
ill
with
a
low
fever
and
so
it
chanced
that
while
her
friends
were
frantic
with
anxiety
over
her
fate
kathleen
lay
passive
in
the
river
cottage
carefully
watched
by
franklyn
who
wondered
much
over
her
mysterious
guest
so
young
and
beautiful
and
she
can
not
be
a
poor
girl
for
her
clothing
is
of
the
finest
quality
franklyn
said
to
her
grandson
perhaps
there
are
people
who
are
anxious
over
her
fate
do
you
think
we
ought
to
let
it
be
known
through
the
papers
she
added
no
not
yet
let
us
wait
till
she
gets
well
and
tells
us
what
to
do
he
replied
chester
franklyn
had
fallen
in
love
at
first
sight
with
the
beautiful
creature
whose
life
he
had
saved
he
was
afraid
that
some
one
would
take
her
away
from
him
if
he
let
her
presence
be
known
let
me
have
my
chance
first
he
said
to
himself
with
all
the
selfish
ardor
of
a
young
lover
it
seemed
strange
that
kathleen
lay
passive
so
long
after
the
fever
left
her
without
seeming
to
take
any
interest
in
anything
they
asked
her
her
name
they
asked
her
where
her
home
was
and
how
she
came
to
be
in
the
river
to
everything
she
answered
dreamily
i
do
not
know
they
did
not
know
that
before
kathleen
had
been
thrown
into
the
river
she
had
swallowed
with
her
food
a
potent
drug
intended
to
produce
death
it
was
entirely
owing
to
the
small
quantity
of
food
she
had
taken
that
she
survived
at
all
but
the
strange
drug
had
partially
paralyzed
her
faculties
memory
was
dormant
or
returned
in
such
faint
gleams
that
it
threw
no
light
on
her
present
state
she
knew
that
two
beautiful
kindly
faces
a
woman
old
but
strangely
lovely
and
a
young
man
with
deep
blue
eyes
and
curls
of
gold
bent
daily
over
her
pillow
she
watched
them
eagerly
she
smiled
at
them
faintly
and
sweetly
but
so
numb
were
her
reasoning
faculties
that
she
did
not
wonder
at
their
presence
there
she
was
utterly
quiescent
franklyn
became
alarmed
fearing
the
girl
was
an
idiot
but
chester
was
indignant
at
the
very
idea
she
has
had
some
shock
that
is
it
he
said
be
patient
grandma
she
will
come
to
herself
it
was
strange
how
his
heart
went
out
to
the
girl
who
lay
so
silently
on
the
pillow
all
day
looking
up
at
him
with
dark
inscrutable
eyes
like
an
infant
in
their
wondering
expression
in
a
week
she
seemed
stronger
she
could
sit
up
in
an
she
even
talked
a
little
but
it
was
just
about
things
that
she
saw
in
the
room
books
pictures
flowers
she
would
say
softly
how
sweet
how
pretty
at
last
she
was
strong
enough
to
walk
about
the
room
grandma
i
think
she
would
like
it
better
in
the
parlor
said
chester
one
day
he
took
her
hand
and
led
her
into
a
pretty
cozy
apartment
chapter
she
was
my
mother
sweet
face
sweet
eyes
and
gleaming
mingling
hair
lips
like
two
rosebuds
dreaming
in
june
air
kathleen
sat
down
in
front
of
a
bright
coal
fire
and
leaned
her
curly
head
back
against
the
in
doing
so
her
upraised
eyes
encountered
over
the
mantel
the
picture
of
a
young
girl
done
in
water
colors
it
was
a
head
and
bust
and
represented
a
beautiful
young
creature
with
rosy
cheeks
pouting
lips
eyes
and
curly
golden
hair
the
expression
of
the
face
was
piquant
and
spirited
and
greatly
resembled
kathleen
own
kathleen
gazed
with
startled
eyes
at
this
beautiful
picture
and
gasped
faintly
who
is
it
she
was
alone
with
chester
and
as
he
looked
up
she
saw
a
shadow
of
pain
cloud
his
eyes
drawing
his
chair
close
to
hers
he
she
was
my
cousin
she
has
been
dead
many
years
her
name
exclaimed
kathleen
excitedly
and
he
lifted
a
warning
hand
not
so
loud
grandma
might
hear
he
said
then
answering
the
puzzled
look
in
her
eyes
he
added
softly
it
was
grandma
youngest
child
her
only
daughter
and
she
met
such
a
tragic
fate
that
it
nearly
broke
her
mother
heart
even
now
she
can
not
bear
to
talk
of
her
we
never
speak
her
name
because
it
makes
our
hearts
ache
it
was
zaidee
zaidee
franklyn
murmured
the
girl
how
did
you
know
in
astonishment
no
matter
tell
me
all
about
her
answered
kathleen
whose
memory
had
returned
to
her
as
by
a
flash
of
lightning
at
sight
of
that
lovely
face
there
is
little
to
tell
he
replied
my
poor
cousin
story
is
short
and
tragic
like
her
life
my
grandmother
had
but
two
children
a
son
and
a
daughter
the
son
my
father
died
years
ago
but
zaidee
his
petted
young
sister
died
years
before
died
alas
by
her
own
hand
she
shivered
like
one
in
a
chill
and
he
said
was
it
not
horrible
she
was
so
young
so
lovely
and
she
had
everything
it
seemed
to
make
her
happy
but
this
is
her
story
when
she
was
barely
sixteen
a
rich
man
from
boston
married
her
and
took
her
away
from
her
simple
home
to
his
grand
rich
one
she
loved
her
handsome
husband
very
dearly
and
seemed
to
be
wildly
happy
her
people
did
not
hear
from
her
often
but
she
sent
this
picture
and
many
gifts
to
her
mother
in
a
year
she
had
a
little
daughter
but
she
did
not
invite
grandma
to
go
and
see
the
child
vincent
carew
was
rich
and
great
and
very
proud
so
the
franklyns
believed
that
he
was
trying
to
break
his
young
wife
off
entirely
from
her
past
the
franklyns
were
proud
too
in
their
way
they
resented
it
and
so
the
communication
between
the
two
families
almost
ceased
until
suddenly
like
a
clap
of
thunder
came
the
news
that
the
young
wife
had
committed
suicide
why
she
gasped
we
do
not
know
it
was
a
profound
mystery
even
to
her
husband
but
it
broke
my
grandfather
heart
he
died
in
less
than
a
week
after
the
news
came
grandma
came
then
to
live
with
us
at
river
cottage
my
mother
died
in
a
few
years
after
then
my
father
we
two
grandma
and
i
are
the
last
of
the
family
unless
my
cousin
kathleen
carew
zaidee
child
is
yet
living
that
we
do
not
know
we
wrote
several
times
no
answer
came
and
we
gave
up
the
hope
of
ever
knowing
the
daughter
of
the
proud
vincent
carew
and
she
has
never
written
to
you
asked
the
girl
in
wonder
never
he
replied
there
must
be
some
mistake
she
faltered
no
there
is
no
mistake
but
i
fancy
the
proud
vincent
carew
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
he
would
not
care
for
his
child
to
know
her
humble
relatives
on
her
mother
side
why
he
was
governor
of
his
state
eight
years
and
was
in
congress
also
the
franklyns
were
plain
simple
people
my
grandfather
and
my
father
were
mechanics
although
nobler
hearts
never
beat
in
human
breasts
and
they
were
never
rich
it
is
from
the
money
they
left
us
that
we
are
enabled
to
live
in
comparative
comfort
now
her
eager
interested
eyes
made
him
go
on
rather
diffidently
as
for
me
i
have
no
taste
that
way
my
desire
is
for
a
literary
life
i
have
written
some
trifles
that
the
critics
praised
your
name
the
girl
asked
curiously
gazing
with
interest
at
his
handsome
face
chester
franklyn
he
replied
would
you
like
to
meet
your
unknown
cousin
the
daughter
of
the
proud
vincent
carew
she
pursued
his
face
grew
grave
i
do
not
know
how
to
answer
you
he
replied
she
would
not
care
for
us
perhaps
her
father
has
never
told
her
about
the
franklyns
she
looked
at
him
with
a
strange
expression
and
held
out
to
him
her
little
white
hand
i
am
your
cousin
i
am
kathleen
carew
she
said
to
him
and
while
he
stared
in
astonishment
she
pointed
at
the
picture
of
the
beautiful
girl
she
was
my
mother
she
said
chapter
li
a
cousin
for
a
lover
ah
love
was
never
yet
without
the
pang
the
agony
the
doubt
which
rends
my
heart
with
ceaseless
sigh
while
day
and
night
roll
darkling
by
byron
what
a
day
that
was
kathleen
seemed
suddenly
to
grow
well
and
strong
at
the
wonderful
discovery
that
it
was
her
own
cousin
who
had
saved
her
life
and
that
the
sweet
lovely
woman
who
had
cared
for
her
so
kindly
was
her
own
dear
grandmother
they
had
volumes
to
tell
each
other
and
how
franklyn
was
shocked
when
she
heard
that
a
decoy
letter
pretending
to
be
from
herself
had
at
last
brought
kathleen
to
richmond
she
wept
bitterly
at
the
thought
that
her
precious
granddaughter
had
so
nearly
lost
her
life
through
this
mysterious
treachery
my
dear
i
never
wrote
you
a
line
nor
did
i
ever
hear
from
you
i
thought
you
were
too
proud
to
care
about
us
so
i
let
you
alone
although
it
nearly
broke
my
poor
heart
she
gazed
with
untiring
love
at
the
beautiful
face
trying
to
trace
in
it
every
faint
resemblance
to
her
dead
daughter
you
are
more
like
your
father
than
your
mother
she
said
with
vague
disappointment
your
eyes
your
features
are
his
but
there
is
an
expression
like
zaidee
and
your
hair
is
gold
like
hers
was
only
a
richer
deeper
shade
you
are
more
beautiful
even
than
zaidee
was
she
continued
fondly
as
she
stroked
the
curls
chester
had
little
to
say
he
looked
and
listened
eagerly
his
heart
thrilling
at
the
thought
that
kathleen
was
his
cousin
and
in
a
measure
belonged
to
them
for
her
father
has
disinherited
her
her
cast
her
off
we
are
her
nearest
and
dearest
and
she
will
stay
with
us
and
share
our
lot
he
said
within
himself
kathleen
while
confiding
very
freely
in
them
had
held
back
with
a
young
girl
shyness
the
story
of
her
love
affair
and
her
engagement
of
marriage
she
did
not
suppose
they
would
care
for
and
she
was
so
anxious
to
know
what
had
befallen
her
uncle
that
she
dwelt
constantly
on
that
subject
perhaps
they
murdered
him
too
she
sobbed
oh
cousin
will
you
not
telegraph
at
once
to
my
friends
in
boston
and
let
them
know
where
i
am
perhaps
in
that
way
i
may
get
news
of
him
sooner
and
they
will
be
so
uneasy
over
my
fate
they
the
young
man
repeated
with
his
curious
eyes
upon
her
face
stone
my
friend
and
darrell
the
man
i
am
to
marry
explained
kathleen
with
a
blush
her
eyes
had
dropped
so
she
did
not
see
the
ashen
pallor
that
suddenly
overspread
chester
franklyn
face
you
will
telegraph
at
once
will
you
not
cousin
she
repeated
and
hastily
scribbled
down
the
addresses
upon
a
card
i
will
go
at
once
he
answered
taking
the
slip
of
paper
and
leaving
the
room
but
a
terrible
temptation
had
assailed
him
why
not
wait
a
little
before
i
send
the
telegrams
he
thought
i
can
not
give
her
up
just
yet
to
the
proud
rich
man
she
is
going
to
marry
if
she
stays
with
us
a
little
longer
i
may
perhaps
win
beautiful
kathleen
from
him
it
ought
to
be
so
grandma
and
i
ought
to
have
zaidee
child
for
our
own
because
we
have
been
cheated
of
her
sweetness
all
our
lives
i
will
not
send
the
telegrams
just
yet
she
will
never
know
he
had
often
read
the
saying
that
all
is
fair
in
love
and
war
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
could
be
nothing
unfair
in
this
but
yet
his
heart
smote
him
when
he
went
back
and
met
the
eager
light
in
the
dark
eyes
he
loved
so
well
they
will
be
so
much
relieved
when
they
know
that
i
am
safe
and
well
she
exclaimed
and
as
soon
as
they
can
they
will
come
for
me
you
are
in
a
great
hurry
to
leave
us
chester
cried
reproachfully
no
indeed
for
i
love
you
both
dearly
the
girl
replied
not
dreaming
how
his
heart
leaped
at
the
words
but
i
am
so
anxious
over
the
fate
of
my
uncle
only
think
cousin
i
do
not
know
if
he
is
dead
or
alive
perhaps
they
drowned
him
too
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
try
and
bear
the
suspense
as
well
as
you
can
i
will
try
to
amuse
you
and
he
kept
his
word
as
far
as
lay
in
his
power
he
read
to
her
sung
to
her
played
games
talked
and
kathleen
would
have
really
enjoyed
his
company
only
for
the
cruel
suspense
of
her
waiting
it
is
strange
they
do
not
come
it
almost
seems
as
if
they
did
not
care
for
me
she
said
wistfully
on
the
third
day
they
will
come
do
not
think
about
them
now
i
want
to
sing
you
this
sweet
little
song
he
said
going
over
to
the
piano
and
seating
himself
he
had
found
out
that
the
best
way
to
amuse
or
interest
kathleen
was
to
read
or
sing
to
her
while
she
lay
quietly
on
the
sofa
her
arms
over
her
head
her
dark
curly
lashes
drooping
over
her
sad
dreamy
eyes
many
a
time
when
he
was
not
looking
the
burning
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
as
she
thought
of
ralph
her
dear
lost
lover
who
was
brought
so
vividly
to
mind
by
chester
poetry
and
songs
so
she
lay
very
still
now
while
chester
who
really
played
and
sung
very
well
poured
out
in
the
sweet
the
passion
that
filled
his
heart
when
nightly
my
wild
harp
i
bring
to
wake
all
its
music
for
thee
so
sweet
looks
that
face
while
i
sing
to
reason
no
longer
i
free
i
forget
thou
art
queen
of
the
land
is
thy
beauty
alone
that
i
see
and
trembling
at
touch
of
thy
hand
all
else
is
forgotten
by
me
the
spell
is
upon
me
asleep
in
the
region
of
dreams
thou
art
mine
i
wake
but
ah
is
to
weep
and
the
hope
of
my
slumbers
resign
ah
hadst
thou
been
less
than
thou
art
or
i
more
deserving
of
thee
thou
mightst
have
been
queen
of
my
heart
thou
mightst
have
been
all
things
to
me
tears
came
to
the
singer
eyes
and
tears
to
the
listener
the
words
were
so
wildly
sad
chester
thought
of
she
of
ralph
so
strange
are
love
entanglements
go
on
she
murmured
unwilling
that
he
should
turn
and
see
the
burning
in
her
eyes
so
chester
selected
another
song
i
something
to
ask
you
kathleen
a
secret
i
fain
would
know
oh
why
do
you
seem
so
strange
kathleen
and
why
do
you
shun
me
so
come
out
on
the
porch
in
the
starlight
sweet
and
tell
me
my
joy
or
woe
your
coldness
is
breaking
my
heart
kathleen
for
darling
i
love
you
so
you
were
never
in
earnest
were
those
your
words
was
that
what
you
meant
to
say
your
tones
were
so
strangely
low
kathleen
yet
i
fancied
i
heard
you
say
i
never
loved
you
was
that
your
voice
or
the
south
wind
dreamy
sigh
kathleen
kathleen
you
are
dreaming
love
or
perhaps
it
is
only
i
go
and
forget
you
kathleen
kathleen
your
light
words
were
spoken
in
vain
the
revel
was
wild
and
the
wine
flowed
red
but
it
never
drowned
his
pain
till
under
the
sod
in
the
autumn
days
he
pillowed
his
dreamless
head
with
twenty
carved
on
the
marble
slab
for
he
was
but
a
boy
said
and
kathleen
goes
on
her
lightsome
way
and
smiles
at
his
simple
heart
and
dazzles
and
lures
as
she
dazzled
him
with
the
coquette
circean
art
while
under
the
turf
light
and
low
molder
the
lips
that
sighed
kathleen
i
love
you
so
he
turned
around
on
the
and
looked
at
her
she
was
sitting
upright
her
dark
eyes
wide
and
startled
forgive
me
he
said
gently
the
name
was
irene
but
i
put
in
yours
because
it
rhymed
so
well
but
why
do
you
choose
such
sad
songs
she
said
they
make
my
heart
ache
because
mine
aches
already
he
answered
impulsively
and
seating
himself
by
her
side
he
continued
passionately
darling
kathleen
i
love
you
and
unless
you
will
give
me
your
love
in
return
i
shall
die
of
heartbreak
like
that
poor
lad
in
the
song
she
remained
perfectly
silent
a
moment
then
answered
rebukingly
but
you
are
my
cousin
cousins
often
marry
he
replied
eagerly
but
i
can
not
marry
you
chester
i
am
engaged
to
marry
a
young
man
in
boston
besides
i
do
love
you
she
replied
do
you
love
of
course
she
replied
but
her
voice
faltered
as
she
thought
how
impossible
it
was
for
her
to
love
teddy
because
of
that
other
passion
in
her
heart
oh
chester
please
let
me
alone
she
cried
with
sudden
petulance
you
have
not
known
me
two
weeks
and
i
do
want
your
love
i
do
not
want
anybody
love
suddenly
she
burst
into
hysterical
tears
chapter
lii
the
search
for
kathleen
oh
when
shall
the
grave
hide
forever
my
sorrow
oh
when
shall
the
soul
wing
her
flight
from
this
clay
the
present
is
hell
and
the
coming
but
brings
with
new
torture
the
curse
of
byron
on
the
night
when
kathleen
was
so
strangely
rescued
from
the
river
a
man
and
woman
left
richmond
by
a
midnight
train
for
new
york
they
were
ivan
belmont
and
fedora
the
woman
who
had
played
such
a
cruel
part
in
the
life
of
ralph
chainey
whatever
their
mission
in
richmond
it
could
not
have
been
an
honest
one
since
they
were
leaving
the
city
in
partial
disguise
ivan
with
a
luxuriant
blonde
beard
and
his
companion
with
a
curly
brown
wig
over
her
flaxen
hair
and
a
dotted
veil
drawn
over
her
bold
handsome
face
they
traveled
second
class
and
seemed
to
shun
observation
conversing
with
each
other
in
low
whispers
it
was
a
very
ugly
thing
for
us
that
the
old
man
got
away
he
observed
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
replied
oh
pshaw
i
do
think
it
matters
he
can
never
catch
up
with
us
who
would
suspect
you
of
being
the
old
negro
or
me
of
being
that
old
witch
grandmother
franklyn
ha
ha
true
he
replied
and
echoed
her
laugh
of
security
forgetting
that
he
laughs
best
who
laughs
last
they
thought
that
uncle
ben
carew
the
old
downcast
farmer
was
a
simple
old
fool
but
they
were
doomed
to
find
themselves
mistaken
he
had
his
wits
about
him
as
he
proved
afterward
for
as
soon
as
he
found
that
the
old
house
was
deserted
he
made
his
way
from
the
gloomy
neighborhood
into
the
busiest
portion
of
the
city
within
an
hour
the
police
were
notified
of
what
had
occurred
and
were
organized
to
search
for
the
missing
girl
they
visited
the
old
house
and
some
one
who
knew
all
about
it
declared
that
the
place
had
not
been
tenanted
for
a
year
the
owners
had
died
and
the
property
had
fallen
to
their
daughter
who
was
an
actress
somewhere
and
had
never
come
to
claim
her
inheritance
the
conspirators
whoever
they
were
had
probably
taken
unlawful
possession
of
the
place
just
long
enough
to
carry
out
their
evil
purposes
and
then
fled
from
the
scene
the
weary
night
passed
away
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
missing
girl
and
at
the
police
headquarters
the
old
man
was
advised
to
secure
the
aid
of
a
detective
in
the
search
for
kathleen
when
he
agreed
to
take
their
advice
and
inquired
who
was
the
best
man
for
the
purpose
they
all
vied
with
each
other
in
recommending
handsome
dashing
jack
wren
the
finest
detective
in
the
whole
south
uncle
ben
who
up
in
boston
had
pretended
to
be
such
a
poor
man
had
a
fat
wallet
in
his
breast
pocket
he
sent
for
jack
wren
and
giving
him
a
princely
retainer
placed
the
case
in
his
hands
now
tell
me
everything
bearing
on
the
case
said
the
detective
uncle
ben
did
so
and
when
dashing
jack
heard
the
story
of
ivan
belmont
and
the
diamonds
he
started
up
excitedly
that
your
man
he
exclaimed
poor
little
miss
carew
things
look
dark
for
her
that
miscreant
has
doubtless
made
way
with
his
rather
than
restore
the
diamonds
or
their
value
uncle
ben
fell
back
white
and
trembling
kathleen
murdered
oh
god
do
not
hint
at
anything
so
horrible
he
gasped
you
must
search
for
her
everywhere
it
may
be
he
has
only
made
her
a
prisoner
chapter
liii
oh
sir
have
pity
on
me
prayed
daisy
lynn
misery
we
have
known
each
other
like
a
sister
and
a
brother
dwelling
in
the
same
lone
home
many
years
shelley
it
seemed
almost
as
if
there
was
a
fate
in
it
that
poor
daisy
lynn
whose
had
so
strangely
crossed
kathleen
should
again
become
a
figure
on
the
scene
of
her
destiny
jack
wren
having
been
furnished
by
uncle
ben
with
a
photograph
of
kathleen
suddenly
chanced
upon
a
face
that
made
him
think
he
had
found
the
missing
girl
it
was
a
face
at
the
window
of
a
little
cottage
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
a
beautiful
face
with
piquant
features
so
close
a
copy
of
kathleen
that
the
detective
was
startled
he
consulted
the
photograph
closely
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
description
answered
in
every
particular
so
he
congratulated
himself
that
he
had
been
mistaken
in
his
theory
that
kathleen
was
dead
but
why
did
they
leave
her
alive
and
what
is
she
doing
here
he
asked
himself
in
wonder
he
made
some
cautious
inquiries
among
the
neighbors
and
he
found
that
the
beautiful
young
girl
was
a
governess
in
the
family
of
a
young
lawyer
who
occupied
the
cottage
his
wife
was
an
invalid
and
had
employed
the
young
girl
to
fill
the
position
of
nursery
governess
to
her
five
boys
the
worst
limbs
in
the
whole
neighborhood
averred
the
gossiping
neighbors
the
new
governess
daisy
lynn
as
she
called
herself
had
only
been
there
three
weeks
they
said
and
they
were
sure
she
would
not
stay
the
month
out
no
one
could
endure
that
perkins
tribe
more
than
a
month
the
oldest
boy
was
twelve
the
youngest
only
four
but
said
the
grocery
man
at
the
corner
from
the
biggest
to
the
littlest
they
are
all
imps
of
satan
but
why
did
the
girl
come
here
why
does
she
stay
evidently
she
is
here
of
her
own
free
will
thought
the
puzzled
detective
he
made
up
his
mind
to
a
bold
procedure
he
would
go
and
see
the
girl
he
rang
the
bell
at
the
door
and
a
slatternly
negro
girl
opened
it
and
started
at
the
caller
with
his
shiny
hat
i
want
to
see
miss
lynn
he
said
and
she
showed
him
into
the
little
parlor
and
went
to
call
the
governess
he
did
not
have
to
wait
long
before
the
face
he
had
seen
at
the
window
appeared
within
the
room
such
a
beautiful
face
but
oh
so
pale
and
frightened
the
sweet
lips
trembling
as
she
said
nervously
i
i
do
know
you
sir
but
i
know
you
miss
carew
he
replied
as
he
rose
and
bowed
miss
carew
she
caught
eagerly
at
the
words
oh
i
knew
you
were
mistaken
that
is
not
my
name
sir
jack
wren
laughed
lightly
and
drew
the
photograph
from
his
pocket
is
not
that
your
face
he
asked
the
lovely
girl
started
with
surprise
oh
dear
it
does
look
like
me
but
i
never
had
my
photograph
taken
in
my
life
she
exclaimed
the
detective
smiled
unbelievingly
you
are
a
very
clever
young
girl
but
i
do
not
understand
your
game
he
said
bluntly
why
have
you
run
away
from
your
friends
and
your
bright
prospects
miss
carew
to
masquerade
under
a
false
name
and
wear
out
your
life
teaching
the
rough
perkins
cubs
she
trembled
and
grew
deathly
pale
as
she
faltered
there
is
there
must
be
some
mistake
my
name
is
really
daisy
lynn
and
i
i
have
not
i
have
no
friends
and
no
bright
prospects
except
to
earn
my
own
living
by
unremitting
toil
tears
came
into
the
dark
eyes
as
she
spoke
the
great
southern
detective
looked
at
her
with
puzzled
eyes
what
superb
acting
he
thought
admiringly
but
what
the
deuce
is
the
matter
with
the
girl
to
make
her
hide
herself
in
this
way
from
her
friends
perhaps
you
do
not
know
who
i
am
he
said
and
he
held
before
her
eyes
a
card
on
which
was
neatly
engraved
his
name
and
profession
i
i
have
heard
of
you
mr
wren
gasped
daisy
lynn
she
sunk
into
a
chair
and
put
her
small
white
hand
before
her
eyes
as
if
to
shut
out
some
dreadful
sight
her
bosom
heaving
with
frightened
sobs
he
remained
perfectly
silent
and
all
at
once
daisy
lynn
slid
out
of
her
chair
and
knelt
in
humility
at
his
feet
oh
sir
have
pity
on
me
she
prayed
go
away
and
leave
me
in
peace
i
am
not
insane
whatever
any
one
may
say
that
was
but
a
temporary
spell
and
under
the
care
of
the
kind
friend
to
whom
heaven
directed
me
that
awful
night
i
soon
recovered
my
reason
a
wrecked
love
had
made
me
mad
but
that
is
all
over
now
only
only
you
would
not
be
able
to
convince
them
of
it
so
i
i
do
not
want
to
go
back
oh
god
i
shall
go
mad
indeed
if
i
am
sent
again
to
that
dreadful
place
wren
perhaps
you
have
a
sister
of
your
own
think
of
her
and
for
sweet
pity
sake
do
not
betray
me
to
my
enemies
who
under
the
guise
of
friends
would
work
me
the
bitterest
woe
a
light
broke
in
upon
his
mind
the
girl
is
insane
that
explains
everything
he
was
a
stern
man
inured
to
trying
scenes
but
his
heart
stirred
with
pity
for
her
so
young
so
beautiful
and
insane
he
went
up
to
her
as
she
rose
and
sunk
feebly
into
her
chair
touching
her
kindly
on
the
shoulder
he
said
i
am
very
very
sorry
for
you
but
it
is
better
that
you
should
return
to
your
friends
they
are
almost
over
your
disappearance
and
have
sent
me
here
for
you
now
get
your
bonnet
like
a
good
girl
and
come
with
me
i
can
not
go
back
to
them
i
would
rather
die
sobbed
daisy
lynn
and
when
he
insisted
she
grew
frantic
and
rebellious
i
will
not
go
she
cried
they
will
put
me
in
a
horrible
lunatic
asylum
although
i
am
not
mad
oh
wren
have
pity
on
a
most
unfortunate
young
girl
go
away
and
tell
them
you
could
not
find
me
heaven
will
bless
you
for
your
goodness
he
thought
it
was
a
very
good
proof
of
her
insanity
that
she
expected
heaven
to
bless
him
for
telling
a
falsehood
for
her
sake
and
smiled
indulgently
as
he
said
my
dear
young
lady
think
of
the
distress
of
your
lover
if
i
go
back
without
you
the
rich
handsome
young
man
you
have
promised
to
marry
an
expression
of
blended
pain
and
scorn
crossed
the
lovely
face
do
not
speak
to
me
of
she
cried
passionately
it
was
his
falsity
that
wrecked
my
life
but
that
brief
madness
has
passed
i
am
sane
now
and
i
scorn
him
as
much
as
i
once
loved
him
oh
the
imperial
scorn
with
which
she
drew
her
graceful
form
erect
the
fire
that
flashed
from
her
lovely
eyes
he
said
to
himself
that
she
was
the
most
beautiful
girl
he
had
ever
beheld
it
is
not
my
false
lover
that
wants
me
i
am
sure
of
that
it
is
my
aunt
that
has
sent
you
she
continued
no
it
is
your
uncle
carew
he
replied
but
i
have
no
uncle
she
replied
in
surprise
he
was
nonplused
at
her
persistence
in
deception
and
said
with
rising
impatience
you
must
really
go
with
me
and
see
carew
if
there
is
any
mistake
he
will
detain
you
but
a
few
minutes
will
you
not
go
and
bring
him
here
she
asked
beseechingly
and
give
you
a
chance
to
escape
while
i
am
away
no
i
am
too
sharp
for
that
get
your
bonnet
and
come
with
me
to
the
hotel
where
your
uncle
is
staying
replied
wren
firmly
with
a
stifled
sob
she
rose
to
obey
although
she
said
you
are
very
cruel
and
i
warn
you
that
if
i
am
sent
to
the
lunatic
asylum
i
shall
kill
myself
they
will
not
send
you
there
he
replied
soothingly
in
a
few
minutes
she
joined
him
in
the
hall
heavily
veiled
and
they
set
forth
on
their
trip
to
the
broad
street
hotel
where
uncle
ben
and
teddy
darrell
were
staying
he
called
a
hack
and
assisted
her
into
it
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
they
arrived
at
their
destination
uncle
ben
was
so
prostrated
with
grief
that
he
had
been
unable
to
leave
his
room
for
days
he
was
now
in
his
private
parlor
and
teddy
was
sitting
with
him
both
men
looking
very
sad
and
dejected
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
and
jack
wren
entered
the
picture
of
triumph
leading
a
beautiful
weeping
girl
kathleen
my
darling
cried
teddy
springing
to
meet
her
but
she
shrieked
in
dismay
i
do
not
know
you
chapter
liv
is
this
your
niece
my
head
is
wild
with
weeping
for
a
grief
which
is
the
shadow
of
a
gentle
mind
i
walk
into
the
air
but
no
relief
to
seek
or
haply
if
i
sought
to
find
shelley
teddy
darrell
was
about
to
clasp
the
beautiful
weeping
girl
in
his
arms
but
at
her
quick
cry
of
alarm
he
recoiled
in
amazement
not
alone
at
her
remonstrance
but
because
her
voice
was
unlike
that
of
kathleen
carew
uncle
ben
who
had
also
started
forward
in
eager
joy
drew
back
at
the
sound
of
the
girl
voice
and
the
great
detective
looked
from
one
face
to
the
other
in
astonishment
carew
he
said
at
last
is
this
your
niece
no
replied
uncle
ben
no
echoed
teddy
darrell
i
told
you
so
cried
daisy
lynn
with
a
radiant
face
and
wren
brought
out
the
photograph
but
this
is
her
very
face
he
exclaimed
they
agreed
with
him
that
it
was
wonderful
the
likeness
that
existed
between
the
girl
and
the
picture
but
they
assured
him
that
there
were
subtle
differences
in
the
features
and
that
the
voices
were
quite
unlike
then
i
have
to
beg
this
young
lady
pardon
said
the
great
detective
rather
crestfallen
at
his
mistake
but
he
added
airily
there
no
harm
done
anyhow
i
beg
your
pardon
but
there
is
answered
daisy
lynn
her
great
eager
eyes
brimming
over
with
tears
i
have
lost
my
situation
with
perkins
through
your
mistake
impossible
he
cried
it
is
alas
too
true
she
answered
sadly
perkins
is
a
very
woman
and
when
i
attempted
to
explain
to
her
why
i
was
going
out
so
suddenly
she
became
terribly
alarmed
at
the
idea
of
my
being
carried
off
by
a
detective
she
hinted
broadly
that
i
must
have
committed
some
dreadful
crime
and
discharged
me
on
the
spot
the
wretch
cried
all
three
of
the
gentlemen
in
chorus
and
teddy
recalling
his
native
gallantry
hastened
to
place
a
chair
for
the
young
girl
pray
sit
down
miss
he
began
miss
daisy
lynn
permit
me
to
present
to
you
carew
and
darrell
said
the
detective
daisy
bowed
as
she
sunk
into
the
chair
but
teddy
darrell
stopped
and
stared
as
if
he
had
seen
a
ghost
daisy
lynn
he
echoed
daisy
lynn
cried
uncle
ben
both
had
heard
the
story
of
unfortunate
daisy
lynn
and
explanations
followed
all
around
the
girl
ceased
weeping
for
herself
to
pity
the
fair
young
girl
who
had
suffered
so
bitterly
in
her
stead
then
jack
wren
who
now
that
everything
was
explained
no
longer
suspected
daisy
of
insanity
spoke
his
mind
i
have
made
a
great
mistake
he
said
but
i
know
that
you
will
agree
with
me
that
it
was
very
natural
under
the
circumstances
i
beg
your
pardon
and
am
ready
to
propose
to
you
a
plan
by
which
to
atone
for
my
folly
she
looked
at
him
attentively
and
he
continued
i
have
a
very
kind
friend
a
widow
lady
who
would
be
very
glad
to
have
you
for
a
companion
i
know
if
you
will
permit
me
i
will
take
you
to
this
kind
lady
at
once
and
i
am
sure
you
will
find
it
a
more
pleasant
situation
than
teaching
those
perkins
cubs
it
was
not
very
pleasant
answered
the
girl
sadly
and
when
she
saw
how
eager
he
was
to
atone
for
the
trouble
he
had
brought
upon
her
she
accepted
his
offer
with
shy
gratitude
taking
a
pleasant
leave
of
carew
and
teddy
she
withdrew
with
the
detective
and
they
were
driven
immediately
to

their

she
murmured
sadly
and
just
then
she
heard
a
low
murmur
of
voices
in
the
parlor
where
she
had
left
franklyn

a
while
ago
pleading
a
headache
as
an

thought

the
murmur

voices
continued
a

then
the
front
door
closed
and
kathleen
thought

guests
were
leaving
directly
afterward
franklyn
entered
the
room
with
an
excited
face
kathleen
do
you
remember
the
strange
story
you
told
us
about
daisy
lynn
she
asked
well
she
is
here
in
this
house
she
is
no
more
insane
than
you
are
and
is
your
living
image
only
perhaps
not
as
pretty
she
knows
all
you
suffered
in
her
place
and
is
just
dying
to
meet
you
will
you
come
down
i
should
like
to
have
her
come
up
here
answered
kathleen
who
felt
as
if
she
would
like
to
be
quite
alone
at
first
with
daisy
lynn
the
fair
young
girl
whose
line
of
life
had
so
strangely
and
tragically
crossed
her
own
franklyn
understood
her
wish
and
a
few
minutes
afterward
she
led
daisy
to
kathleen
door
and
gently
withdrew
they
looked
at
each
other
the
two
beautiful
young
creatures
then
they
smiled
at
the
likeness
they
saw
in
each
other
faces
at
that
smile
their
hearts
leaped
to
each
other
daisy
lynn
oh
you
poor
darling
cried
kathleen
holding
out
her
arms
daisy
ran
into
them
they
kissed
then
wept
together
they
sat
down
side
by
side
on
the
bed
like
two
sisters
and
wept
like
little
children
for
a
while
then
daisy
wiped
her
eyes
and
said
piteously
oh
miss
carew
can
you
forgive
me
it
was
not
your
fault
daisy
darling
but
you
must
call
me
kathleen
you
know
we
are
not
strangers
to
each
other
i
know
all
about
you
i
have
lived
at
your
home
slept
in
your
pretty
room
and
can
ever
forgive
dear
i
read
your
sweet
diary
i
was
so
lonely
and
so
curious
over
the
girl
whose
identity
had
become
mixed
with
mine
it
was
very
silly
was
it
not
that
is
all
i
regret
about
it
daisy
lynn
answered
blushing
crimson
then
she
looked
fearlessly
into
kathleen
eyes
as
she
added
but
i
am
cured
now
i
despise
him
i
could
not
love
him
now
if
he
begged
me
on
his
knees
i
am
glad
of
that
dear
for
he
was
not
worthy
of
you
said
kathleen
fervently
you
know
him
cried
the
other
girl
in
surprise
and
then
kathleen
told
her
all
about
her
wicked
she
was
rejoiced
to
see
how
disgusted
daisy
lynn
became
with
the
accomplished
villain
who
had
once
been
the
hero
of
her
girlish
dreams
but
daisy
tell
me
where
you
have
been
all
this
time
said
kathleen
curiously
and
daisy
smiled
as
she
answered
most
of
the
time
with
an
old
couple
in
the
country
to
whose
lonely
little
house
i
wandered
that
night
after
i
escaped
from
my
keeper
and
wandered
into
the
woods
you
see
kathleen
i
was
not
violently
insane
only
sort
of
melancholy
mad
for
a
while
and
because
i
foolishly
attempted
to
poison
myself
an
incompetent
physician
pronounced
me
mad
and
persuaded
my
aunt
to
send
me
to
a
lunatic
asylum
well
in
my
horror
and
grief
i
confided
my
cruel
distress
to
those
good
old
people
and
they
believed
me
and
pitied
me
they
let
me
stay
with
them
and
were
as
good
to
me
as
if
they
had
been
my
parents
a
few
months
ago
the
good
old
man
died
and
his
gentle
old
wife
soon
followed
him
to
the
grave
then
the
little
farm
passed
into
the
ownership
of
a
distant
connection
of
theirs
lawyer
perkins
of
richmond
he
employed
me
to
teach
his
children
she
went
on
then
and
told
kathleen
how
strangely
the
detective
had
found
her
and
all
that
had
happened
afterward
so
uncle
ben
is
alive
thank
heaven
i
must
go
to
him
cried
kathleen
springing
to
her
feet
in
wild
excitement
no
dear
for
wren
has
gone
to
bring
them
here
to
you
franklyn
told
him
you
were
here
replied
daisy
then
she
started
as
a
low
rap
sounded
on
kathleen
door
when
she
opened
it
there
was
chester
looking
so
remorseful
and
dejected
that
her
tender
heart
leaped
with
pity
for
his
woe
may
i
speak
to
you
alone
for
one
moment
dear
cousin
he
asked
humbly
she
went
out
into
the
little
hall
with
him
and
chester
manfully
confessed
his
sin
and
humbly
begged
her
forgiveness
all
my
foolish
plans
for
keeping
you
away
from
your
own
true
lover
and
winning
you
for
myself
have
come
to
naught
heaven
watched
over
you
dear
kathleen
and
foiled
my
selfish
love
oh
heaven
how
ashamed
i
am
how
wretched
and
you
can
never
forgive
me
yes
i
can
answered
the
girl
nobly
she
pressed
his
hand
gently
in
hers
as
she
added
i
forgive
you
dear
cousin
and
i
will
forget
all
about
it
and
remember
nothing
but
that
i
owe
you
my
life
god
bless
you
he
said
chokingly
and
went
but
he
was
not
brave
enough
to
meet
his
rival
yet
he
went
away
for
a
long
walk
unwilling
to
witness
the
meeting
between
kathleen
and
her
betrothed
the
man
that
jack
wren
said
was
so
rich
and
handsome
poor
fellow
he
might
have
felt
happier
had
he
known
how
little
kathleen
cared
for
teddy
it
was
ralph
who
filled
all
her
thoughts
hopeless
as
they
were
how
am
i
changed
my
hopes
were
once
like
fire
i
loved
and
i
believed
that
life
was
love
i
love
but
i
believe
in
love
no
more
love
is
a
tyrant
that
has
no
mercy
i
wish
i
could
forget
all
my
past
she
sighed
nightly
to
her
pillow
but
shelley
lines
would
recur
to
her
with
cruel
pathos
forget
the
dead
the
o
yet
there
are
ghosts
that
may
take
revenge
for
it
memories
that
make
the
heart
a
tomb
regrets
that
glide
through
the

and
with
ghastly
whispers

lost

scarcely
left
the
house
before
the

returned
with

and
teddy

a
sedate
kiss
and
fell
into

tennyson
kathleen
remained
a
week
longer
with
her
relatives
but
such
importunate
letters
came
to
her
from
stone
and
helen
fox
that
she
decided
to
go
home
to
boston
promising
her
grandmother
that
they
should
meet
often
in
future
leaving
her
friend
daisy
to
brighten
the
quietude
of
river
cottage
kathleen
departed
with
her
uncle
and
her
betrothed
for
boston
she
had
promised
daisy
that
she
would
stop
in
philadelphia
and
inquire
for
her
about
her
aunt
miss
watts
she
also
wanted
to
see
her
benefactor
the
hall
to
her
dismay
she
found
on
inquiry
that
miss
watts
had
died
three
months
before
and
her
will
made
years
ago
bequeathed
her
snug
little
fortune
to
her
niece
daisy
lynn
there
were
no
greedy
relatives
to
dispute
the
will
so
kathleen
had
the
blended
pain
and
pleasure
of
writing
to
daisy
that
she
was
bereaved
of
her
only
living
relative
by
death
but
that
her
aunt
demise
had
left
her
rich
kathleen
sent
her
address
to
samuel
hall
and
the
young
man
came
promptly
to
call
on
her
his
kind
face
beaming
with
delight
at
seeing
again
the
beautiful
heroine
of
his
romantic
adventure
he
was
shocked
however
when
he
heard
of
the
second
peril
from
which
she
had
escaped
it
is
that
woman
fedora
who
planned
it
i
feel
sure
he
exclaimed
for
he
believed
the
woman
was
wicked
enough
for
anything
kathleen
did
not
agree
with
him
for
her
uncle
had
confided
to
her
his
and
the
detective
belief
that
ivan
belmont
was
the
guilty
party
jack
wren
had
been
to
boston
carefully
spotting
the
young
man
movements
from
the
time
that
kathleen
had
charged
him
with
the
theft
of
her
jewels
and
he
believed
he
had
found
a
clew
that
if
carefully
followed
up
would
lead
to
his
conviction
uncle
ben
carew
was
very
much
pleased
with
kathleen
friend
and
when
he
left
her
went
for
a
stroll
down
chestnut
street
with
him
sammy
hall
thought
that
the
old
gentleman
was
very
inquisitive
he
asked
so
many
questions
getting
out
of
the
rather
quiet
young
man
the
fact
that
he
was
engaged
to
a
beautiful
miss
tessie
mays
but
that
they
thought
themselves
too
poor
to
marry
until
he
had
laid
by
a
little
sum
for
housekeeping
you
shall
hear
from
me
again
young
man
said
uncle
ben
mysteriously
and
he
did
several
months
later
when
he
had
almost
forgotten
all
about
the
old
man
promise
he
received
a
deed
of
gift
to
the
pretty
little
furnished
house
where
miss
watts
had
lived
uncle
ben
had
bought
it
from
daisy
lynn
who
continued
to
reside
with
the
franklyns
and
he
gave
it
to
sammy

in
his
niece
name
marry
your
lovely
tessie
and
be
happy
in
your
cottage
home
the

of
kathleen
grateful
heart
to
her
noble
friend
wrote
kathleen
sweetly
sammy
hall
lost
no
time
in
taking
this
pleasant
advice
and
he
and
his
charming
tessie
spent
a
long
and
pleasant
life
in
the
pretty
cottage
home
their
first
daughter
was
called
tessie
for
her
mother
but
the
next
time
heaven
sent
them
girl
twins
as
like
as

to
kathleen
that

i
shall
be
glad
to

kathleen
answered
she
had
been
back
at
stone
for
a
week
but
neither
carew
nor
alpine
had
called
on
her
or
sent
any
message
the
heartless
wretches
as
stone
said
indignantly
rumor
said
that
the
mother
and
daughter
were
making
hasty
preparations
to
sail
for
europe
to
be
absent
several
years
it
was
rumored
also
that
the
disreputable
ivan
had
crossed
the
sea
before
them
flying
from
justice
the
story
of
kathleen
lost
diamonds
was
public
property
now
but
there
was
no
chance
that
she
would
ever
recover
the
jewels
or
their
value
for
ivan
had
disappeared
and
his
mother
and
sister
angrily
repudiated
the
debt
uncle
ben
himself
went
to
the
two
proud
women
begging
them
to
do
his
niece
justice
think
madame
he
said
you
and
your
daughter
have
stripped
kathleen
of
everything
the
jewels
were
all
that
remained
to
her
and
now
that
she
is
to
marry
a
rich
man
she
would
like
to
have
the
money
for
her
wedding
it
is
very
little
to
you
out
of
your
great
wealth
but
to
her
it
is
be
just
and
fair
and
make
good
what
she
has
lost
by
your
son

carew
laughed
mockingly
i
would
not
give
her
a
penny
if
she
were
starving
to
death
she
said
your
own
husband
daughter
he
said
reproachfully
i
hate
her
the
more
for
that
i
hate
everybody
he
ever
loved
she
replied
vindictively
you
hated
poor
zaidee
and
caused
her
death
i
know
he
replied
bitterly
her
face
suddenly
grew
livid
and
she
looked
at
her
accuser
with
startled
eyes
it
it
is
false
she
muttered
weakly
it
is
god
truth
answered
the
old
man
you
told
zaidee
carew
a
story
of
her
husband
falsity
and
then
her
death
followed
answer
me
this
madame
was
her
death
a
suicide
or
a
murder
she
quailed
before
the
stern
old
man
pale
as
death
trembling
with
nervous
alarm
but
alpine
rose
up
suddenly
and
interposed
between
him
and
her
mother
how
dare
you
distress
my
mother
so
with
your
shocking
hints
and
suspicions
she
cried
violently
get
out
of
here
at
once
you
old
wretch
or
i
will
call
jones
to
throw
you
out
into
the
street
as
your
mother
did
poor
kathleen
he
sneered
and
served
her
right
she
hissed
then
she
rang
the
bell
violently
when
jones
appeared
she
said
take
this
old
beggar
and
throw
him
into
the
street
if
you
ever
admit
him
again
you
will
be
discharged
uncle
ben
moved
toward
the
door
with
jones
but
looking
back
asked
pleadingly
will
not
pay
your
brother
debt
never
now
go
she
stormed
and
the
rich
curtains
fell
behind
the
bent
retreating
form
but
from
the
hall
a
strange
exultant
laugh
came
back
to
them
and
carew
shuddered
heavens
how
horribly
that
laugh
sounded
like
my
husband

byron
helen
fox
was
a
very
bright
girl
she
did
not
tell
kathleen
that
ralph
chainey
frequently
visited
the
house
nor
did
she
mention
to
him
that
kathleen
was
to
be
her
guest
yet
she
knew
very
well
that
the
unhappy
young
lovers
were
sure
to
meet
under
her
roof
and
in
fact
kathleen
had
not
been
hours
at
helen
when
george
fox
encountered
ralph
somewhere
and
dragged
him
home
with
him
kathleen
was
playing
and
singing
for
helen
her
back
was
turned
to
the
door
so
she
did
not
know
when
the
two
young
gentlemen
entered
and
silently
seated
themselves
obeying
a
gesture
from
helen
the
young
girl
unconscious
of
her
lover
presence
sung
on
sweetly
and
sadly
one
word
is
too
often
profaned
for
me
to
profane
it
one
feeling
too
falsely
disdained
for
thee
to
disdain
it
one
hope
is
too
like
to
despair
for
prudence
to
smother
and
pity
from
thee
more
dear
than
that
from
another
i
can
give
not
when
men
call
love
but
wilt
thou
accept
not
the
worship
the
heart
lifts
above
and
the
heavens
reject
not
the
desire
of
the
moth
for
the
star
of
the
day
for
the
morrow
the
devotion
to
something
afar
from
the
sphere
of
our
sorrow
the
plaintive
words
rang
in
sad
echoes
through
her
lover
brain
the
desire
of
the
moth
for
the
star
of
the
day
for
the
morrow
she
turned
around
and
in
a
minute
more
she
saw
him
coming
forward
to
speak
to
her
a
start
and
she
recovered
herself
enough
to
speak
to
him
but
her
voice
faltered
and
the
little
hand
as
it
touched
his
was
deadly
cold
it
was
like
the
old
sad
song
we
met
was
in
a
crowd
and
i
thought
he
would
shun
me
he
came
i
could
not
breathe
for
his
eyes
were
upon
me
he
spoke
his
words
were
cold
though
his
smile
was
unaltered
i
knew
how
much
he
felt
for
his
voice
faltered
she
did
not
know
what
he
was
saying
to
her
or
what
she
murmured
in
reply
she
could
realize
nothing
clearly
but
the
ecstatic
consciousness
of
his
presence
that
had
such
power
to
thrill
her
whole
being
then
she
found
herself
slipping
into
a
seat
by
helen
and
twining
her
cold
fingers
in
those
of
her
friend
they
turned
the
conversation
cleverly
away
from
her
but
in
a
very
few
moments
george
fox
got
up
and
left
the
room
saying
as
he
went
i
will
get
those
specimens
we
were
talking
about
ralph
ten
minutes
later
he
called
down
the
stairs
helen
will
you
please
come
up
and
help
me
find
those
things
i
brought
from
palestine
for
ralph
george
can
never
find
anything
without
my
assistance
laughed
the
young
girl
as
she
excused
herself
and
left
the
room
the
unhappy
lovers
were
alone
together
perhaps
by
the
clever
scheming
of
george
and
helen
perhaps
by
chance
who
could
tell
there
ensued
a
moment
of
intense
embarrassment
kathleen
sitting
with
eyes
felt
her
lover
eager
brown
eyes
upon
her
and
a
deep
blush
arose
to
her
beautiful
face
slowly
she
raised
her
bashful
eyes
and
they
met
his
deep
passionate
reproachful
beseeching
all
in
one
in
spite
of
herself
her
own
gaze
replied
to
that
look
answered
love
for
love
a
moment
and
he
rose
and
came
toward
her
she
thrilled
with
ecstasy
as
he
sat
down
by
her
side
her
little
hand
icy
cold
a
moment
before
grew
burning
hot
as
he
touched
it
with
his
own
kathleen
forgive
me
he
murmured
but
i
can
not
let
this
blessed
chance
pass
i
wrote
to
you
did
you
receive
my
letter
yes
she
faltered
cruel
girl
and
you
would
not
reply
kathleen
was
that
just
or
fair
could
you
find
no
excuse
in
your
heart
for
me
when
i
had
told
you
my
whole
sad
story
i
i
was
sorry
for
you
i
wanted
to
write
but
i
promised
not
to
she
whispered
almost
inaudibly
promised
not
to
write
to
me
his
dark
eyes
flashed
with
anger
who
was
so
cruel
as
to
forbid
you
mr
darrell
no
no
teddy
knows
nothing
it
was
my
uncle
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
would
not
be
right
to
my
to
to
mr
darrell
to
darrell
oh
kathleen
is
it
true
that
you
will
marry
him
do
you
love
him
do
not
ask
me
it
is
not
right
you
you
are
not
free
she
cried
trying
to
be
loyal
to
her
absent
betrothed
i
shall
be
soon
the
courts
will
certainly
grant
me
a
divorce
from
that
dreadful
woman
but
then
kathleen
my
freedom
will
avail
me
nothing
if
you
are
lost
to
me
oh
my
own
love
my
darling
be
brave
and
break
through
the
fetters
that
bind
you
to
this
man
you
do
not
love
wait
for
me
oh
the
passionate
pleading
in
his
voice
and
eyes
how
they
thrilled
her
soul
she
wished
to
herself
that
she
had
never
seen
poor
teddy
whom
she
had
so
rashly
promised
to
marry
oh
i
must
not
listen
to
you
she
sobbed
please
ralph
do
not
speak
to
me
so
do
not
look
at
me
i
can
not
bear
your
eyes
and
she
hid
her
own
with
a
trembling
hand
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
but
ralph
could
not
give
it
up
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
pleading
for
more
than
life
kathleen
do
be
angry
dear
but
i
can
not
give
it
up
so
easily
he
began
if
i
thought
you
did
not
love
me
if
i
believed
you
cared
for
teddy
darrell
i
would
not
say
another
word
but
if
i
were
free
you
would
love
me
again
would
you
not
my
dear
one
kathleen
had
been
fighting
down
the
weakness
of
her
loving
heart
she
looked
at
him
with
sad
hopeless
eyes
spare
me
she
sighed
oh
ralph
we
must
not
count
on
what
has
been
or
what
may
be
i
am
promised
to
another
and
i
can
not
break
my
vow
think
of
the
suffering
i
should
bring
to
teddy
noble
heart
he
would
soon
forget
you
ralph
chainey
urged
then
you
may
soon
forget
me
too
she
replied
but
kathleen
my
darling
it
is
so
different
i
love
only
you
while
your
teddy
has
had
scores
of
loves
think
if
you
marry
him
his
fickle
heart
may
soon
tire
of
you
then
how
wretched
you
would
be
i
do
not
believe
that
teddy
is
fickle
if
i
thought
so
i
would
beg
him
to
release
me
from
my
promise
but
he
loves
me
truly
in
spite
of
his
past
and
so
i
must
be
true
to
him
sadly
replied
kathleen
and
your
marriage
day
is
set
he
asked
gloomily
it
is
only
two
weeks
from
now
she
replied
then
her
courage
failed
her
she
burst
into
tears
and
sobbed
miserably
against
his
shoulder
ralph
tried
to
soothe
her
whispering
if
he
knew
you
cared
like
this
for
me
he
would
not
want
to
marry
you
no
true
lover
would
accept
the
hand
without
the
heart
he
must
never
know
for
i
i
shall
learn
to
love
him
by
and
by
stone
says
so
they
all
say
so
she
whispered
they
are
driving
you
into
a
a
a
wretched
future
with
their
silly
advice
cried
the
young
man
violently
despair
goading
him
to
desperation
he
pushed
her
from
him
and
rose
to
his
feet
i
have
been
deluding
myself
he
said
bitterly
i
thought
you
loved
me
i
was
mistaken
i
see
i
will
never
humble
myself
to
you
again
proud
kathleen
from
this
moment
to
my
life
end
we
are
strangers
farewell
and
with
a
stately
bow
he
was
gone
kathleen
sprung
to
her
feet
with
wild
despair
at
her
loss
oh
ralph
come
back
she
cried
faintly
but
he
was
beyond
the
reach
of
her
voice
she
threw
herself
weeping
into
the
chair
where
he
had
sat
but
just
now
gone
and
forever
she
sobbed
in
bitterest
agony
and
there
came
over
her
a
longing
to
die
and
be
at
rest
from
her
sorrow
life
seemed
too
bitter
to
be
borne
now
that
the
last
hope
had
failed
and
ralph
had
gone
from
her
forever
chapter
lix
oh
ralph
chainey
wake
how
murderers
walk
the
earth
beneath
the
curse
of
cain
with
crimson
clouds
before
their
eyes
and
flames
about
their
brain
for

left
upon
their
souls
its
everlasting

ralph
chainey
left
the
presence
of
his
loved
and
lost
kathleen
with
a
heart
full
of
bitterness
and
pain
and
hurried
home
he
had
concluded
his
engagement
in
boston
the
previous
evening
and
it
was
a
great
relief
to
him
for
he
was
eager
to
get
away
from
the
city
that
held
kathleen
stay
there
and
see
her
wedded
to
another
he
could
not
that
way
lay
madness
he
had
dismissed
his
company
for
several
months
he
was
going
to
travel
he
said
although
the
manager
pointed
out
to
him
that
now
was
the
time
to
reap
a
golden
harvest
if
ever
he
was
even
more
popular
now
than
before
if
such
a
thing
could
be
the
divorce
proceedings
had
given
him
notoriety
people
who
had
not
gone
to
see
him
act
before
went
now
just
for
a
sight
of
his
handsome
face
he
loved
his
art
but
the
money
was
no
object
to
him
fortune
had
already
showered
her
golden
favors
on
him
in
lavish
measure
he
could
not
be
tempted
to
remain
no
mother
i
can
not
stay
he
answered
sadly
when
she
pleaded
with
him
i
must
get
away
as
soon
as
this
divorce
business
is
settled
that
will
be
soon
in
a
week
or
so
my
lawyers
tell
me
then
i
will
go
abroad
and
try
to
live
down
this
unpleasant
notoriety
you
do
not
blame
me
mother
she
sighed
but
answered
bravely
no
but
it
will
be
very
lonely
my
son
you
will
have
my
brother
his
wife
and
little
ones
to
cheer
you
he
said
moved
to
the
heart
by
her
tears
he
knew
well
that
he
was
her
favorite
son
he
kissed
her
and
went
to
his
own
room
wrote
some
letters
and
then
went
with
his
mother
for
a
drive
at
night
he
felt
as
if
the
day
had
been
a
month
long
oh
how
cruel
it
was
this
love
that
mastered
him
in
spite
of
his
pride
you
may
rouse
your
pride
you
may
use
your
reason
and
seem
for
a
space
to
slay
love
so
but
all
in
his
own
good
time
and
season
it
will
rise
and
follow
you
go
he
threw
himself
down
dressed
on
a
couch
in
the
luxurious
room
and
gave
himself
up
to
memories
of
the
girl
he
loved
so
hopelessly
living
over
in
his
thoughts
every
time
he
had
met
her
until
now
when
her
dark
eyes
had
made
shipwreck
of
his
life
time
passed
unnoted
although
the
tiny
french
clock
had
tinkled
musically
the
midnight
hour
what
a
picture
of
manly
beauty
he
made
lying
there
with
eyes
on
the
rich
couch
with
its
oriental
draperies
the
down
cast
weird
shadows
all
about
the
room
in
the
little
beyond
seen
through
the
all
was
dark
and
still
did
a
white
desperate
face
with
gleaming
eyes
peer
out
of
that
gloom
upon
the
young
man
resting
there
in
his
velvet
one
shapely
hand
tossed
up
over
his
brown
curly
head
the
dark
curly
lashes
drooping
downward
to
the
pale
cheek
yes
he
was
well
worth
looking
at
this
gifted
young
actor
this
genius
who
at
barely
had
scored
such
dazzling
successes
in
the
dramatic
world
and
written
his
name
up
high
upon
the
scroll
of
fame
it
was
no
wonder
that
women
raved
over
his
beauty
and
his
genius
and
that
they
filled
his
daily
mail
with
love
letters
that
he
flung
into
the
fire
after
one
contemptuous
glance
but
were
they
eyes
of
love
that
gleamed
on
him
now
lying
so
pale
and
still
and
sad
with
his
thoughts
upon
his
beautiful
young
love
alas
a
gleam
of
tigerish
hate
shone
in
those
orbs
as
they
watched
the
young
man
and
when
at
last
the
fringed
lashes
drooped
against
his
cheek
a
faint
sigh
of
relief
escaped
the
lips
of
the
impatient
watcher
for
hours
and
hours
she
had
been
waiting
there
but
it
seemed
as
if
he
did
not
mean
to
retire
now
he
had
fallen
into
a
light
doze
perhaps
he
would
sleep
there
all
night
oh

from
the
curtained
darkness
beyond

fiend

gliding
toward

the
shrouding
hood
of

back
from
the
face
of
a
woman
a
bold

face
with
eyes
and
glittering

hair
in

upraised
hand
glitters
a

thin

his

poises
her
shining
weapon
on

for

it

ralph
chainey
was
sleeping
but
lightly
and
as
the
cold
steel
entered
his
breast
a
shudder
ran
over
his
whole
frame
the
dew
of
pain
started
on
his
brow
and
with
a
shriek
of
mortal
agony
he
staggered
to
his
feet
clutching
blindly
at
the
midnight
assailant
she
had
not
counted
on
this
she
thought
her
frenzied
blow
would
be
short
sharp
and
decisive
that
she
would
have
time
to
fly
from
the
scene
of
her
terrible
crime
she
was
mistaken
his
outstretched
arms
caught
and
held
her
with
the
momentary
fierce
strength
of
a
dying
man
his
blood
spurted
out
in
hot
streams
upon
her
face
and
hands
and
meanwhile
his
shriek
of
agony
had
aroused
the

earl

his

started
wildly
from
his
dreams
and
his

awful

chainey
lying
awake
and
restless
brooding
over
her

departure
recognized
ralph

in
an
instant
and
with
a
terrible
foreboding
of
evil
sprung
forward
to
his
rescue

the
threshold
of

they
met

and
her

the

wide
and
together
they
sprung
into

not
a

soon
was
their
entrance

ralph

strength
had
failed
from
the
profuse
loss
of
blood
he
had
struggled
madly
to
hold
his
assailant
but
her
superior
strength
had
overpowered
him
and
as
he
sunk
back
heavily
upon
the
couch
she
raised
her
bloody
weapon
for
a
second
surer
blow
but
it
never
reached
its
mark
for

caught
and
flung

my

back
from
the
grave
oh
my
dear
how
ill
you
look
this
morning
surely
you
did
not
sleep
well
helen
fox
exclaimed
gazing
in
surprise
and
pain
at
pale
cheeks
and
heavy
somber
eyes
it
was
the
morning
after
her
painful
interview
with
ralph
kathleen
had
not
closed
her
heavy
eyes
all
night
for
thinking
of
her
lost
lover
and
his
cruel
parting
words
they
had
pierced
her
heart
like
a
thorn
and
some
sweet
sad
lines
strangely
appropriate
rang
in
dizzy
changes
through
her
brain
it
came
with
the
merry
may
love
it
bloomed
with
the
summer
prime
in
a
dying
year
decay
love
it
brightened
the
fading
time
i
thought
it
would
last
for
years
love
but
it
went
with
the
winter
snow
only
a
year
ago
love
only
a
year
ago
was
a
plant
with
a
deeper
root
love
than
the
blighting
eastern
tree
for
it
grew
in
my
heart
and
its
fruit
love
was
a
bitter
morsel
to
me
the
poison
is
yet
in
my
brain
love
the
thorn
in
my
heart
for
you
know
was
only
a
year
ago
love
only
a
year
ago
yes
the
girl
thought
sadly
bitterly
the
root
of
that
love
went
so
deep
in
my
heart
that
i
can
never
pluck
it
out
unless
my
life
goes
with
it
oh
god
that
i
forget
that
i
could
give
my
heart
to
the
one
who
holds
the
promise
of
my
hand
oh
teddy
teddy
you
deserve
more
of
me
than
this
you
are
so
good
so
noble
you
believe
in
me
so
fully
little
dreaming
that
the
heart
which
should
be
yours
is
given
to
another
she
looked
at
helen
with
a
smile
so
faint
that
it
was
sadder
than
tears
she
could
not
speak
and
helen
put
her
arm
tenderly
about
the
drooping
little
figure
so
pathetic
in
its
unspoken
despair
understanding
without
one
word
all
the
sorrow
in
kathleen
heart
and
even
then
the
newsboys
running
through
the
streets
were
shouting
wildly
extra
copies
of
all
about
the
murder
of
the
handsome
actor
ralph
chainey
by
his
jealous
wife
their
startled
ears
caught
the
sound
the
name
starting
apart
the
two
beautiful
young
girls
gazed
with
blanched
faces
into
each
other
eyes
the
words
were
repeated
clearly
just
beneath
the
window
blasting
words
that
coldly
drove
the
shuddering
blood
back
from
kathleen
lips
to
her
heart
with
a
moan
she
slipped
down
to
the
floor
winding
her
arms
about
helen
knees
leaning
her
head
against
her
while
she
wailed
dead
murdered
oh
my
love
ralph
then
consciousness
fled
she
slipped
inertly
to
the
floor
and
helen
with
a
pallid
face
and
trembling
limbs
ran
out
to
purchase
a
copy
of
ere
kathleen
had
recovered
from
her
swoon
helen
had
hastily
run
over
the
startling
news
the
attempted
murder
of
ralph
chainey
by
fedora
the
woman
whom
he
was
suing
in
the
courts
for
divorce
but
for
the
opportune
entrance
of
his
brother
earl
chainey
ran
the
paragraph
the
fiend
would
have
succeeded
in
her
fell
design
the
deadly
blade
was
descending
a
second
time
to
sheath
itself
in
the
victim
breast
when
she
was
caught
and
violently
hurled
aside
by
earl
chainey
she
proved
to
be
fedora
the
wife
whom
he
was
suing
for
divorce
she
now
lies
in
a
prison
cell
awaiting
her
punishment
which
will
probably
be
a
capital
one
as
ralph
chainey
has
never
regained
consciousness
owing
to
the
loss
of
blood
and
his
death
is
momentarily
expected
it
was
to
bear
this
terrible
shock
to
her
heart
that
kathleen
recovered
consciousness
was
it
not
a
wonder
she
did
not
go
mad
with
the
horror
of
it
all
parting
from
her
only
yesterday
in
despair
and
anger
lying
dead
perhaps
this
moment
dying
at
least
and
dying
before
he
had
forgiven
her
for
her
coldness
and
hardness
oh
god
the
pity
of
it
all
weeping
she
lay
upon
helen
breast
pride
all
gone
she
laid
her
heart
bare
to
her
sympathetic
friend
oh
helen
it
will
kill
me
unless
i
go
to
him
unless
he
speaks
my
forgiveness
before
he
dies
you
go
my
darling
was
the
answer
and
in
less
than
an
hour
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
the
two
girls
stepped
into
it
and
they
were
rapidly
driven
to
chainey
suburban
home
all
the
way
kathleen
lay
upon
her
friend
breast
weeping
always
weeping
in
all
her
long
she
could
never
forget
that
long
hour
of
misery
and
suspense
in
which
she
could
not
tell
whether
she
should
find
him
dead
or
alive
would
he
pronounce
her
forgiveness
or
would
his
lips
be
stiff
in
death
and
the
memory
of
his
anger
remain
forever
a
thorn
in
her
heart
how
the
cold
march
rain
swirled
through
the
leafless
shrubbery
about
the
great
stone
house
with
its
closed
doors
and
windows
suggesting
so
vividly
the
presence
of
death
thank
god
there
was
one
thing
lacking
the
funereal
crape
upon
the
door
at
the
worst
he
was
still
alive
alive
alive
oh
thank
god
murmured
kathleen
through
her
raining
tears
helen
tenderly
supported
her
as
they
left
the
carriage
soon
they
were
within
the
house
kathleen
was
waiting
with
a
wildly
beating
heart
for
some
one
to
come
to
them
but
when
ralph
mother
came
to
them
kathleen
was
beyond
speech
it
was
helen
who
had
to
prefer
the
request
that
they
should
see
ralph
friends
old
and
dear
friends
she
said
in
excuse
the
gentle
lady
looked
in
wonder
at
the
beautiful
weeping
girl
the
fairest
she
had
ever
beheld
her
heart
went
out
to
her
at
those
tears
they
are
for
my
boy
she
thought
tenderly
but
she
hesitated
for
the
doctors
had
forbidden
any
one
to
enter
the
room
he
knows
no
one
he
has
spoken
but
twice
and
then
just
to
utter
a
name
she
said
looking
doubtfully
at
the
two
fair
supplicants
a
name
whispered
kathleen
eagerly
yes
it
is
that
of
a
young
girl
whom
i
fancy
he
loves
if
it
were
only
now
she
said
musingly
the
name
questioned
helen
fox
with
eager
impatience
kathleen
replied
chainey
oh
what
a
cry
came
from
kathleen
lips
oh
my
love
my
love
you
have
not
forgotten
me
i
am
kathleen
oh
madame
let
me
go
to
him
come
was
the
thrilling
answer
and
as
she
led
the
girl
away
kathleen
heart
throbbed
wildly
with
the
thought
that
she
should
hear
his
lips
pronounce
her
forgiveness
and
he
shall
not
die
my
love
shall
call
him
back
from
the
grave
she
sobbed
chapter
lxi
she
loved
much
i
would
have
rather
been
a
slave
in
tears
in
bondage
by
his
side
than
shared
in
all
if
wanting
him
this
world
had
power
to
give
beside
landon
she
was
kneeling
by
his
couch
she
was
gazing
through
her
blinding
tears
upon
that
pallid
emotionless
face
as
still
now
as
though
it
already
bore
the
stamp
of
death
her
hand
touched
his
but
it
did
not
respond
to
her
passionate
pressure
and
when
she
called
his
name
there
was
no
answer
not
even
a
quiver
of
the
dark
curling
lashes
lying
so
heavily
against
the
cheek
chainey
and
the
two
physicians
looked
on
in
the
tenderest
compassion
the
story
of
the
young
girl
love
was
written
on
her
anguished
face
and
they
knew
alas
that
ralph
chainey
lay
close
to
the
borders
of
the
dark
eyes
would
never
open
on
that
most
beautiful
face
bending
over
him
the
pale
lips
would
never
unclose
to
speak
her
name
breathlessly
she
called
upon
his
name
beseeching
him
to
look
at
her
to
speak
to
her
but
the
spell
that
wrapped
him
was
too
deep
those
strong
men
listening
to
her
wept
in
sympathy
they
had
no
hope
it
had
been
so
difficult
to
stanch
the
flow
of
blood
from
the
terrible
wound
so
close
to
his
heart
that
he
was
sinking
from
inanition
he
could
not
survive
the
weakness
suddenly
the
girl
turned
and
looked
at
them
they
were
whispering
together
she
caught
some
disjointed
words
it
has
been
tried
with
success
you
remember
cases
of
but
he
is
so
far
gone
i
doubt
transfusion
of
blood
do
you
think
it
startled
them
the
way
the
weeping
girl
sprung
to
her
feet
new
life
seemed
to
come
to
her
she
threw
off
the
long
fur
cloak
from
her
slender
form
pushed
back
the
sleeve
from
the
most
beautiful
white
arm
they
had
ever
beheld
and
cried
beseechingly
you
can
save
him
oh
take
my
blood
my
very
life
so
that
you
restore
him
they
were
shocked
at
first
but
she
would
not
listen
she
implored
them
to
yield
to
her
wish
i
am
so
strong
i
have
such
splendid
health
it
will
not
hurt
me
i
can
bear
it
she
cried
pleadingly
and
they
were
full
of
admiration
for
her
courage
and
bravery
her
lovely
face
shone
with
its
lofty
purpose
impossible
they
answered
but
they
gazed
with
admiring
eyes
at
the
beautiful
girl
whose
fresh
young
loveliness
indeed
hinted
at
glowing
health
and
strength
but
it
seemed
hopeless
such
an
experiment
he
was
so
far
gone
any
minute
might
launch
his
life
bark
out
upon
unknown
sea
she
could
not
bear
it
this
obstinate
refusal
oh
to
save
him
to
save
him
she
would
lay
down
her
life
a
desperate
thought
came
to
her
her
dark
eyes
fastened
on
a
rich
blue
vein
in
the
rosy
white
arm
she
had
bared
to
their
view
a
furtive
movement
and
she
had
slipped
from
the
burnished
mass
of
her
golden
tresses
a
toy
dagger
with
a
hilt
maddened
with
misery
she
thrust
the
keen
point
against
the
blue
vein
and
the
scarlet
tide
of
her
spurted
out
in
a
tiny
vivid
jet
oh
horror
they
sprung
toward
her
one
bound
a
handkerchief
over
the
wound
but
her
bravery
had
thrilled
their
hearts
they
could
not
hesitate
longer
it
was
a
forlorn
hope
but
yes
they
would
try
the
experiment

so
silent
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
had
you

i
died
my
dead

must
have
heard
you
call
and

with

doctor

was
an
enthusiast
in
his
art
and
his
fine
eyes
shone
with
eager
interest
as
he
realized
the
delicate
and
dangerous
operation
that
lay
before
him
and
his
colleague
doctor
miller
both
were
comparatively
young
but
they
had
attained
eminence
already
and
if
any
physician
in
boston
was
capable
of
conducting
this
experiment
it
was
one
or
both
of
these
two
they
gazed
anxiously
into
each
other
eyes
as
they
made
their
hasty
preparations
would
it
fail
or
would
it
succeed
death
was
so
near
so
perilously
near
would
the
rushing

numb
veins

stricken

weeping
and
praying
by
her
boy
side
and
in
the
darkened
parlor
helen
fox
waiting
in
keen
suspense
lifted
her
heart
in
earnest
petitions
that
god
would
spare
the
young
life
trembling
in
the
balance
within
the
great
house
all
was
trembling
anxiety
and
suspense
while
outside
the
wild
march
wind
shook
the
dead
branches
of
the
trees
and
drove
the
gusty
rain
against
the
windows
with
a
mournful
patter
as
though
kindly
nature
wept
for
the
bright
young
life
going
out
into
darkness
when
years
had
fled
and
gray
hairs
began
to
creep
into
their
bonny
brown
curls
doctor
beard
and
doctor
miller
still
loved
to
tell
the
story
of
that
day
and
how
it
ended
of
the
patient
who
lay
so
close
so
awfully
close
to
the
portals
of
death
that
it
did
not
seem
possible
for
human
art
to
save
him
and
of
the
beautiful
brave
young
girl
who
had
prayed
them
on
her
knees
to
take
the
blood
from
her
round
white
arm
and
infuse
it
into
the
patient
giving
him
new
life
how
they
had
hesitated
to
wound
that
tender
exquisite
flesh
and
how
she
had
taken
the
initiative
thrusting
a
jeweled
pin
from
her
hair
into
the
blue
vein
i
tell
you
it
was
cried
doctor
beard
with
enthusiasm
i
could
hesitate
no
longer
i
was
longing
to
make
the
experiment
from
the
first
moment
the
thought
entered
my
head
so
we
asked
the
consent
of
miss
fox
the
young
girl
dearest
friend
who
had
brought
her
there
she
was
willing
and
we
tried
it
tried
it
and
with
the
grandest
success
it
was
magical
the
way
that
the
girl
fresh
young
blood
put
new
life
into
him
agreed
doctor
miller
why
i
give
you
my
word
i
had
faith
in
the
operation
the
fellow
looked
like
a
dead
man
i
could
have
sworn
he
would
never
revive
again
yet
it
was
magical
as
i
said
just
now
when
we
had
carefully
bound
up
their
arms
that
brave
beautiful
girl
leaned
over
him
looked
into
his
face
and
cried
in
accents
of
piercing
anguish
ralph
my
darling
come
back
to
kathleen
you
must
not
die
and
you
may
believe
me
or
not
said
doctor
beard
taking
the
thread
of
the
story
again
but
the
dead
man
opened
his
eyes
and
met
her
look
the
color
began
to
come
back
to
his
ashen
face
he
smiled
faintly
whispered
her
name
turned
on
his
side
and
slept
calmly
as
a
weary
child
that
was
the
proudest
moment
of
my
life

chapter
lxiii
within
prison
bars
oh
my
heart
my
heart
is
sick
and
awaiting
i
looked
out
for
his
coming
as
a
prisoner
through
the
grating
looks
and
longs
and
longs
and
wishes
for
its
opening
day
jean
ingelow
a
week
and
yet
he
has
never
been
near
me
not
a
word
not
a
sign
what
does
he
mean
why
has
he
left
me
to
my
cruel
fate
the
beautiful
prisoner
raged
up
and
down
the
narrow
limits
of
her
prison
cell
like
a
caged
lioness
so
desperate
was
her
mood
so
fierce
her
unrest
such
cruel
and
heartless
neglect
from
him
who
incited
me
to
that
dark
deed
is
unbearable
he
does
not
yet
know
fedora
if
he
believes
she
will
tamely
bear
it
and
she
clinched
her
white
hands
ominously
her
eyes
glittering
with
anger
as
she
thought
of
the
man
for
whom
she
had
risked
so
much
yet
who
seemed
to
have
left
her
to
her
fate
without
an
effort
to
save
her
where
is
he
what
has
become
of
him
will
he
leave
me
to
die
like
a
rat
in
a
hole
and
i
thought
he
loved
me
fool
that
i
was
did
i
not
already
know
men
too
well
to
trust
him
oh
fool
that
i
was
and
yet
dare
he
desert
me
the
partner
in
his
terrible
secret
perhaps
the
coward
has
fled
fearing
that
i
may
betray
him
so
she
raved
on
every
moment
increasing
her
impotent
fury
no
answer
to
my
letters
no
notice
taken
of
my
passionate
appeals
why
he
might
have
effected
my
escape
ere
this
if
he
had
tried
and
i
escape
it
is
true
i
can
not
be
hung
since
that
foolish
girl
saved
ralph
life
when
he
was
on
the
brink
of
death
but
if
i
am
sentenced
i
shall
be
sent
to
prison
for
long
long
years
i
can
not
bear
the
thought
oh
god
i
stifling
dying
she
threw
herself
on
her
hard
couch
sobbing
in
hysterical
a
grating
sound
at
the
door
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
the
portal
opened
closed
again
inside
stood
a
beautiful
young
girl
gazing
with
sad
accusing
eyes
at
the
wretched
sobbing
woman
fedora
looked
up
with
a
cry
of
wonder
mingled
with
rage
kathleen
carew
yes
kathleen
answered
the
other
she
advanced
and
they
gazed
in
momentary
silence
into
each
other
eyes
the
girl
ralph
chainey
loved
and
the
woman
that
was
his
wife
why
are
you
here
muttered
fedora
hoarsely
as
she
started
to
her
feet
for
justice
answered
kathleen
sternly
justice
yes
justice
to
the
man
you
tried
to
murder
the
man
i
saved
from
death
saved
yes
curse
you
forever
for
that
deed
snarled
the
prisoner
viciously
kathleen
recoiled
a
little
at
her
terrible
aspect
and
said
in
wonder
why
did
you
do
it
why
did
you
want
him
dead
i
hated
him
i
hate
you
i
know
but
you
would
soon
have
been
free
of
him
by
the
law
why
did
you
want
to
kill
him
it
was
horrible
life
is
so
sweet
when
one
is
young
and
ralph
is
young
only
said
the
young
girl
almost
piteously
why
do
you
come
here
to
probe
into
my
secrets
fedora
cried
fiercely
listen
then
i
wanted
him
dead
before
he
secured
the
divorce
so
that
i
might
inherit
his
wealth
i
his
loving
widow
ha
ha
was
it
not
a
clever
scheme
she
laughed
wildly
and
coming
closer
to
kathleen
glared
threateningly
into
her
eyes
as
she
hissed
you
foiled
me
you
curse
you
i
repeat
let
me
but
escape
and
i
will
murder
you
a
weaker
heart
than
kathleen
might
have
quailed
before
such
threats
but
she
stood
there
trembling
but
courageous
an
earnest
purpose
in
her
splendid
eyes
these
are
idle
words
and
i
did
not
come
here
to
bandy
words
with
you
i
came
to
make
a
solemn
appeal
to
you
she
said
meekly
almost
beseechingly
appeal
to
me
asked
the
prisoner
with
a
scornful
laugh
and
then
she
waited
out
of
curiosity
for
the
other
answer
do
you
remember
that
night
in
philadelphia
kathleen
asked
yes
i
remember
you
were
wearing
my
diamonds
the
ones
that
were
stolen
from
me
that
night
when
i
was
left
for
dead
on
the
ground
at
lincoln
station
you
told
me
told
me
her
voice
faltering
that
ralph
chainey
gave
you
the
jewels
oh
god
i
think
if
i
had
quite
believed
that
horrible
story
i
should
have
died
but
there
was
always
the
merciful
doubt
the
hope
that
it
might
not
be
true
that
saved
me
from
madness
she
paused
but
the
prisoner
did
not
speak
only
smiled
derisively
so
i
have
come
to
you
for
the
truth
went
on
the
girl
oh
for
sake
speak
and
tell
me
you
lied
it
was
not
ralph
it
could
not
be
perhaps
you
are
shielding
the
guilty
man
behind
his
identity
are
you
tell
me
the
truth
i
will
not
ask
you
to
betray
the
criminal
i
do
not
wish
to
punish
him
only
tell
me
it
was
not
ralph
and
she
waited
in
wild
suspense
for
the
answer
fedora
evilly
handsome
face
had
on
it
a
smile
of
triumph
she
was
gloating
over
the
young
girl
misery
so
you
love
she
exclaimed
tauntingly
and
the
deep
color
rose
up
over
kathleen
face
at
the
cruel
sneer
she
trembled
with
emotion
although
she
tried
to
appear
indifferent
as
she
answered
i
did
not
come
here
to
discuss
with
you
madame
fedora
was
regarding
her
with
a
fixed
gaze
a
cunning
thought
had
entered
her
mind
how
much
is
my
secret
worth
to
you
she
asked
all
the
wealth
in
the
world
if
i
had
it
but
i
am
penniless
i
can
not
buy
your
secret
kathleen
answered
sadly
fedora
came
nearer
and
whispered
in
her
ear
if
i
tell
you
the
truth
will
you
help
me
to
escape
i
could
not
do
it
if
i
wished
to
do
so
ever
so
much
it
would
take
money
and
i
have
already
told
you
i
have
none
the
voice
was
cold
and
dull
kathleen
began
to
realize
how
hopeless
was
her
mission
the
cruel
calculating
woman
before
her
had
no
pity
for
her
misery
but
fedora
was
scheming
in
her
mind
how
to
turn
her
secret
to
account
she
hated
kathleen
too
bitterly
to
show
her
any
kindness
but
if
she
could
pay
for
the
secret
she
wanted
so
badly
why
let
her
have
it
she
looked
at
kathleen
with
a
cunning
expression
there
is
one
condition
on
which
i
will
tell
you
what
you
want
to
know
i
have
already
told
you
that
i
have
no
money
i
do
not
mean
money
listen
miss
carew
you
know
ivan
belmont
yes
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
if
he
knew
about
my
trouble
he
would
try
to
help
me
i
think
do
you
know
where
he
is
can
you
send
word
to
him
i
do
not
know
anything
about
his
whereabouts
you
must
find
out
you
must
tell
him
that
i
fedora
have
sent
you
to
him
tell
him
i
command
him
to
come
to
me
here
return
to
me
with
a
letter
from
ivan
belmont
and
you
shall
hear
the
truth
about
the
diamonds
i
swear
it
they
gazed
at
each
other
fedora
flushed
and
eager
kathleen
excited
sorely
tempted
what
say
you
is
my
price
too
great
demanded
the
prisoner
no
kathleen
replied
turning
to
go
she
said
i
will
surely
find
ivan
belmont
and
bring
the
letter
the
door
closed
the
prisoner
was
again
alone
within
the
grated
cell
the
hours
dragged
on
and
brought
the
gloomy
night
with
it
there
hovered
over
the
great
city
the
black
and
vulture
wings
of
a
terrible
storm
it
hissed
it
roared
it
swept
with
devastating
cyclonic
force
through
that
area
where
the
prison
was
situated
trees
roofs
houses
even
yielded
to
its
terrific
fury
and
flew
like
feathers
before
its
angry
breath
the
poor
prisoners
cowering
in
superstitious
terror
before
the
awful
voices
of
the
warring
elements
prayed
to
god
for
mercy
but
the
answer
seemed
far
far
away
for
suddenly
there
came
a
terrible
deafening
roar
the
earth
seemed
to
rock
like
a
cradle
and
the
great
stone
tower
of
the
prison
fell
with
a
sound
as
though
heaven
and
hell
had
clashed
while
lurid
flames
shot
up
from
the
awful
ruin
into
the
midnight
air
sentence
of
death
had
already
been
pronounced
on
many
who
were
awaiting
trial
and
many
a
soul
went
up
in
that
holocaust
of
smoke
and
flame
and
tempest
to
render
an
account
of
the
deeds
done
in
the
flesh
some
few
survived
some
few
escaped
where

a

waste
on

sorry
i
have
time
to
read
it
but
a
fellow
must
look
out
for
his
own
neck
and
mine
has
felt
deuced
uncomfortable
ever
since
i
found
out
that
that
devil
jack

is
on
my
trail
how
he
strike
it
i
wonder
for
i
thought
we
had
covered
up
our
tracks
very
cleverly
but
the
fellow
a
they
tell
me
and
i
got
to
escape
him
poor
fedora
it
a
pity
to
leave
you
to
your
fate
but
the
sooner
i
pack
up
and
be
afloat
on
the
briny
the
better
for
my
neck
muttered
ivan
belmont
airily
as
he
moved
about
his
shabby
apartment
in
a
very
unsavory
quarter
of
boston
gathering
together
his
belongings
that
were
scattered
about
on
chairs
and
tables
the
letter
from
fedora
that
he
had
found
on
coming
in
he
tossed
unread
into
the
fire
and
as
he
ransacked
the
bureau
drawers
he
hummed
carelessly
have
i
been
true
to
you
now
i
true
no
longer
it
was
long
past
midnight
the
tempest
had
spent
its
force
and
only
a
fitful
soughing
wind
and
gusty
dashes
of
icy
rain
remained
as
souvenirs
of
its
terrific
fury
its
worst
force
had
not
reached
this
neighborhood
and
ivan
little
dreamed
that
the
prison
doors
had
been
hurled
asunder
by
the
blind
force
of
nature
and
that
his
partner
in
wickedness
had
been
released
and
was
hastening
to
their
rendezvous
in
eager
joy
recklessly
he
flung
on
the
floor
her
dainty
garments
and
pretty
trinkets
seeking
the
diamonds
he
had
given
her
in
the
days
when
he
loved
her
first
love
that
had
long
ago
tired
and
had
now
grown
heedless
indifferent
but
what
the
devil
did
she
do
with
them
i
positive
she
left
them
here
can
they
have
been
stolen
they
are
worth
a
pretty
penny
to
me
now
they
would
help
me
to
get
away
from
this
place
that
is
getting
too
hot
to
hold
me
help
you
to
get
away
you
coward
who
helped
me
i
wonder
the
devil
i
suppose
they
say
he
takes
care
of
his
own
said
a
mocking
voice
behind
him
he
turned
with
a
start
there
stood
fedora
fedora
or
her
ghost
the
voice
was
there
the
glittering
eyes
but
where
was
all
the
prettiness
where
the
burnished
golden
locks
the
silk
attire
this
woman
was
drenched
with
rain
clothed
in
rags
and
the
disheveled
tresses
that
straggled
over
her
brow
and
shoulders
had
turned
dead
white
and
their
silver
gleam
was
in
awful
contrast
with
the
drops
of
blood
that
trickled
down
her
ashen
face
he
stared
like
one
turned
to
stone
he
doubted
the
evidence
of
his
own
eyes
that
voice
those
eyes
but
could
it
be
fedora
yes
it
is
i
she
said
answering
that
mute
wondering
look
i
am
here
escaped
from
the
wreck
of
my
prison
to
find
you
you
dastardly
thief
trying
to
steal
my
jewels
your
own
gift
to
me
you
shall
suffer
for
this
night
work
villain
you
tempted
me
to
aid
you
in
your
crimes
then
left
me
to
suffer
the
penalty
alone
but
i
will
betray
you
and
you
shall
know
how
it
feels
to
be
shut
within
prison
walls
deserted
by
the
one
who
swore
fealty
forever
in
happier
days
he
had
been
so
disgusted
so
enraged
that
he
was
about
to
retort
in
angry
sneering
words
that
would
drive
her
forever
from
him
but
at
her
threatening
words
his
defiant
mood
changed
to
one
of
cringing
abject
fear
though
inwardly
shrinking
from
her
altered
looks
in
keen
disgust
he
dared
not
show
his
feelings
he
must
temporize
he
must
turn
her
from
her
savage
purpose
he
approached
her
he
held
out
his
hand
ta
ta
dolly
we
are
not
going
to
part
in
this
fashion
are
we
surely
you
did
not
mind
if
i
sold
the
diamonds
to
get
you
out
of
prison
it
was
a
big
bribe
i
know
but
the
guard
would
not
listen
to
a
penny
less
you
should
have
been
free
but
how
lucky
that
you
escaped
and
we
have
the
jewels
still
he
slipped
his
arm
around
her
and
in
spite
of
her
anger
in
spite
of
her
suspicions
of
his
falsity
the
woman
head
dropped
against
his
breast
she
loved
him
with
all
the
heart
she
had
this
petted
darling
of
the
she
who
had
trifled
with
the
hearts
of
nobler
men
had
found
in
this
weak
nature
her
ideal
and
he
led
her
on
to
lower
and
lower
depths
until
she
was
wrecked
on
the
shoals
of
sin
nestling
in
the
arms
that
were
so
reluctant
to
hold
her
fedora
told
the
man
how
she
had
escaped
from
her
prison
in
the
company
of
an
aged
prisoner
a
convict
under
a
for
murder
you
have
often
told
me
that
your
father
was
dead
ivan
she
said
did
you
believe
it
or
was
it
a
falsehood
i
i
believed
it
he
replied
weakly
no
you
did
not
she
replied
triumphantly
ah
my
lord
how
proud
you
have
been
of
your
connection
with
the
carews
yet
your
father
is
an
escaped
convict
under
sentence
for
life
have
you
forgotten
his
name
let
me
refresh
your
memory
george
harrison
alias
dutch
fred
ah
you
start
you
remember
yes
he
told
me
his
whole
history
and
i
gave
him
the
address
of
your
mother
once
his
wife
he
will
go
to
her
he
said
and
demand
half
her
fortune
ivan
belmont
was
silent
a
moment
from
chagrin
then
he
rose
superior
to
the
situation
ha
ha
how
the
will
rave
he
laughed
i
wish
papa
success
in
plucking
the
madame
the
devil
knows
what
a
time
i
had
coaxing
and
wheedling
pennies
out
of
her
pocket
the
vision
rising
in
his
mind
of
this
proud
mother
and
consternation
roused
his
risibilities
and
he
laughed
loud
and
long
they
had
discarded
him
flung
him
off
like
a
dog
what
a
glorious
retribution
but
they
turned
presently
from
even
this
savory
morsel
to
their
own
affairs
both
were
in
peril
and
it
would
not
do
to
remain
in
reach
of
the
law
yet
ivan
was
by
no
means
ready
to
give
up
his
cherished
plans
they
sat
far
into
the
wintry
dawn
exchanging
confidences
and
plotting
new
schemes
to
be
unraveled
on
fate

loom

a
horrible
old
man

sees
you
alpine
belmont
said
entering
her
mother
one
rainy
evening
just
a
few
days
after
the
cyclone
i
will
not
see
him
i
have
just
refused
to
see
that
old
impostor
my
husband
brother
indeed
contemptuously
and
i
will
not
be
annoyed
again
tell
jones
to
send
the
old
beggar
away
alpine
was
pale
her
eyes
had
a
troubled
look
he
says
that
he
is
not
a
beggar
mamma
that
he
has
claims
on
you
i
am
afraid
you
had
better
see
him
he
is
making
such
a
noise
at
the
door
and
jones
says
he
is
somewhat
intoxicated
tell
jones
to
pitch
him
into
the
street
he
tried
to
but
the
old
man
was
more
than
a
match
for
him
do
come
mamma
it
so
disgraceful
the
sensation
he
is
creating
people
are
gathering
around
the
house
let
us
have
him
in
and
try
to
pacify
him
her
arguments
conquered
and
carew
sent
down
word
to
admit
the
old
man
to
a
small
room
where
the
servants
were
accustomed
to
come
to
her
for
orders
alpine
trepidation
had
somewhat
unnerved
her
mother
and
as
she
swept
into
the
little
room
her
air
was
a
trifle
less
haughty
and
her
proud
eyes
gazed
anxiously
about
for
the
cause
of
this
commotion
there
he
lay
sprawled
upon
a
luxurious
sofa
an
old
man
in
ragged
garments
but
with
a
very
head
and
the
stubble
of
several
days
growth
upon
his
chin
his
keen
eyes
devoured
with
a
hungry
gaze
the
handsome
face
before
him
a
cry
of
surprise
and
terror
burst
from
her
blanching
lips
george
george
harrison
yes
george
harrison
your
husband
answered
the
intruder
and
a
hoarse
cry
of
despair
broke
upon
the
air
from
the
lips
of
alpine
who
had
glided
in
unheeded
by
both
she
stood
behind
her
mother
gazing
with
affrighted
eyes
at
the
coarse
leering
face
carew
recoiled
she
threw
out
her
white
hands
all
glittering
with
costly
rings
as
though
to
shut
out
some
terrible
sight
the
man
laughed
at
her
terror
and
gliding
forward
seized
and
held
her
hands
are
you
glad
to
see
me
my
wife
come
give
me
a
kiss
for
the
old
times
sake
my
beauty
she
struggled
with
him
loathing
the
offered
caresses
and
alpine
sprung
to
her
mother
assistance
beating
him
back
with
dainty
jeweled
hands
he
turned
then
and
saw
her
for
the
first
time
his
narrow
eyes
dilated
with
surprise
why
you
pretty
you
must
be
my
daughter
alpine
how
do
you
do
my
dear
give
your
papa
a
kiss
dear
you
are
not
not
she
choked
over
the
word
and
he
answered
with
sudden
gravity
i
am
your
father
george
harrison
my
little
girl
and
i
went
to
prison
for
life
for
killing
a
man
who
was
once
my
dearest
friend
why
well
your
mother
might
tell
you
if
she
would
i
will
spare
her
for
your
sake
you
seem
to
love
her
he
seemed
to
have
grown
suddenly
sober
after
the
first
sight
of
his
daughter
face
well
she
has
prospered
has
she
not
she
is
rich
and
grand
while
i
have
lain
in
prison
all
these
years
but
a
few
miles
from
her
my
heart
burning
with
hate
for
her
and
aching
with
love
for
my
boy
and
girl
ivan
and
alpine
while
she
taught
them
to
forget
that
they
ever
had
a
father
other
than
vincent
carew
the
proud
millionaire
alpine
speak
to
me
for
once
call
me
father
a
spasm
of
pain
contracted
the
worn
features
he
raised
longingly
to
her
face
love
shone
in
his
eyes
poor
convict
that
he
was
and
although
he
had
come
to
curse
the
mother
and
extort
money
from
her
the
memory
of
it
fled
from
him
now
as
he
gazed
imploringly
on
alpine
lovely
soulless
face
with
outstretched
hands
he
besought
her
kindness
surely
the
fiends
in
hell
could
have
had
no
more
hateful
look
than
the
girl
turned
upon
the
suppliant
as
he
bowed
the
knee
before
her
so
entreatingly
angrily
she
struck
at
the
outstretched
hands
exclaiming
you
have
no
claim
on
me
i
hate
you
hate
you
could
a
strong
man
heart
break
for
so
common
a
thing
as
a
hardness
and
ingratitude
it
would
seem
so
for
the
escaped
felon
turned
aside
with
such
a
look
on
his
face
as
it
might
have
worn
had
a
dagger
pierced
his
heart
it
seemed
as
if
he
meant
to
go
he
staggered
toward
the
door
tripped
and
fell
prostrate
his
face
quivered
with
one
or
two
spasms
then
he
lay
still
and
dead
his
white
face
upturned
to
their
startled
gaze
dead
muttered
carew
staring
down
in
mingled
terror
and
relief
dead
echoed
alpine
in
a
sort
of
awe
and
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
terrible
silence
then
alpine
crept
to
her
mother
side
mamma
was
it
true
yes
it
was
true
there
you
have
my
awful
secret
bury
it
deep
in
your
heart
alpine
for
no
one
must
ever
know
now
we
must
call
the
servants
to
put
the
body
out
we
can
not
have
anything
so
vulgar
as
a
dead
tramp
lying
in
the
house
she
moved
toward
the
door
but
her
steps
were
arrested
by
a
stern
voice
stay
she
turned
with
a
start
and
shudder
a
man
had
emerged
from
behind
the
curtain
at
first
sight
it
seemed
to
be
uncle
ben
carew
the
old
man
so
cordially
despised
but
with
a
rapid
hand
he
flung
off
wig
whiskers
and
spectacles
standing
revealed
in
majestic
beauty
vincent
carew
my
god
she
cried
and
flew
to
embrace
him
he
repulsed
her
with
scorn
and
loathing
how
dare
you
you
jezebel
he
cried
down
on
your
knees
to
that
dead
man
there
you
and
your
cowardly
daughter
and
pray
his
forgiveness
for
the
sin
that
wrecked
his
life
vile
creature
that
you
are
you
would
throw
him
into
the
street
like
a
dog
no
let
him
lie
there
to
be
buried
at
my
expense
i
heard
all
that
was
said
i
know
all
your
guilty
secrets
oh
vincent
forgive
me
forgive
me
my
temptation
was
so
great
she
cried
frantically
but
he
spurned
her
outstretched
hands
can
one
forgive
a
fiend
he
said
sternly
i
tell
you
i
know
all
the
plot
that
broke
my
zaidee
heart
and
drove
her
to
madness
and
death
perhaps
you
murdered
her
who
knows
no
no
i
swear
i
did
not
i
am
innocent
of
that
charge
she
was
so
young
so
jealous
it
was
easy
to
drive
her
mad
but
vincent
it
was
for
love
of
you
can
you
not
forgive
so
great
a
love
if
scorn
could
have
blasted
her
his
look
would
have
struck
her
dead
at
his
feet
forgiveness
is
not
possible
he
answered
bleakly
and
silenced
her
with
a
gesture
of
his
hand
listen
he
said
looking
her
in
the
face
i
was
not
lost
at
sea
when
my
ship
burned
i
was
cast
away
on
a
desert
island
where
i
remained
until
a
few
months
ago
when
i
returned
i
took
a
fancy
to
masquerade
to
see
how
matters
were
going
there
is
no
uncle
ben
i
never
had
a
brother
but
the
disguise
has
served
its
purpose
i
know
you
now
you
and
your
scheming
daughter
now
listen
to
your
fate
no
do
not
speak
hear
me
out
i
will
keep
the
secret
of
your
disgrace
and
you
were
to
have
sailed
you
two
for
europe
your
trunks
are
packed

passage

the
same
but
you
will
never

you
have
no
claim
on
me
you
belong
to
that
dead
man
there
go
now
to
your
rooms
i
wish
never
to
look
on
your
faces
again
but
the
curse
of
a
man
will
follow
you
to
your
grave
chapter
lxvi
i
will
go
to
the
old
haunted
mill
said
kathleen
bravely
we
must
love
and
unlove
and
forget
dear
fashion
and
shatter
the
spell
of
how
many
a
love
in
a
life
dear
ere
we
learn
to
love
once
and
love
well
kathleen
carew
sat
in
the
library
of
helen
fox
home
with
her
cheek
bowed
in
the
hollow
of
her
delicate
hand
and
a
very
sad
expression
in
her
downcast
eyes
she
was
thinking
of
the
tragedy
of
two
weeks
ago
by
which
the
prison
walls
had
been
rent
asunder
sending
so
many
wicked
souls
to
their
account
with
god
and
in
that
awful
wreck
fedora
perished
poor
guilty
soul
and
with
her
died
the
secret
i
would
have
risked
so
much
to
know
now
i
shall
never
know
it
but
ralph
dear
ralph
i
must
trust
you
blindly
i
must
not
let
this
dark
cloud
of
suspicion
drift
between
us
but
oh
heaven
that
it
might
have
been
lifted
she
half
sobbed
in
her
in
those
two
weeks
many
things
had
transpired
of
interest
to
kathleen
the
carews
had
gone
abroad
and
although
kathleen
knew
it
not
they
had
faded
forever
out
of
the
life
that
they
had
done
so
much
to
wreck
and
ruin
uncle
ben
as
he
still
called
himself
had
not
yet
disclosed
his
identity
to
his
daughter
but
kept
up
his
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
the
grand
carew
mansion
remained
closed
and
silent
and
people
said
that
carew
and
miss
belmont
intended
to
be
absent
for
years
ralph
chainey
under
the
magical
influence
of
renewed
hope
was
fast
recovering
his
health
again
kathleen
and
helen
had
been
to
see
him
several
times
and
although
no
tender
words
had
been
uttered
between
them
ralph
no
longer
feared
and
dreaded
handsome
teddy
he
fancied
that
all
would
come
right
between
him
and
his
darling
but
kathleen
was
very
sad
at
heart
she
had
the
greatest
esteem
and
regard
for
her
betrothed
and
shrunk
from
telling
him
the
unflattering
truth
that
her
heart
belonged
to
another
man
he
has
been
so
good
and
kind
to
me
how
can
i
grieve
him
so
she
thought
the
ring
of
the
startled
her
from
her
sad
thoughts
several
letters
were
handed
in
on
one
she
recognized
the
writing
of
her
cousin
chester
she
broke
the
seal
with
eager
impatience
and
as
she
read
on
smiles
began
to
dimple
her
scarlet
lips
helen
who
was
reading
her
own
letters
was
startled
at
a
gay
exclamation
from
her
friend
oh
helen
good
news
chester
and
daisy
are
engaged
but
i
thought
it
was
you
he
loved
my
dear
oh
a
mere
fancy
it
is
that
dear
darling
daisy
lynn
he
loves
and
she
there
a
little
note
from
her
too
she
has
forgotten
or
outlived
that
old
love
gives
her
whole
tender
heart
to
chester
listen
helen
how
he
writes
me
apologetically
you
know
fearing
i
may
think
him
fickle
she
read
aloud
with
a
mischievous
smile
playing
round
her
lips
born
of
beauty
at
one
birth
she
held
hearts
a
kindred
sway
and
wore
the
only
form
on
earth
that
could
have
lured
my
heart
away
helen
smiled
in
sympathy
poor
boy
i
glad
he
to
be
made
happy
she
said
then
she
nervously
fingered
a
letter
she
held
is
from
loyal
she
said
bashfully
from
loyal
oh
helen
is
he
ever
coming
back
to
america
you
cruel
girl
why
did
you
send
him
away
i
did
not
know
my
own
mind
the
beautiful
young
girl
answered
in
a
low
voice
and
then
she
added
softly
you
remember
those
sweet
lines
of
jean
ingelow
didst
set
thy
foot
on
the
ship
and
sail
to
the
and
the
snow
thou
wert
sad
for
thy
love
did
not
avail
and
the
end
i
could
not
know
how
could
i
tell
i
should
love
thee
whom
that
day
i
held
not
dear
how
could
i
know
i
should
love
thee
away
when
i
did
not
love
thee
anear
oh
you
darling
i
so
glad
cried
kathleen
springing
to
her
friend
side
and
giving
her
a
girlish
hug
that
dear
loyal
graham
i
always
thought
he
was
perfectly
grand
and
i
know
you
will
be
happy
with
him
does
he
yet
darling
yes
and
he
is
coming
home
to
and
her
soft
blue
eyes
drooped
with
a
loving
smile
to
the
dear
letter
ah
the
gladness
ah
the
madness
ah
the
magic
of
a
letter
and
helen
recalled
the
beautiful
lines
of
adelaide
proctor
dear
i
tried
to
write
you
such
a
letter
as
would
tell
you
all
my
heart
written
love
is
poor
one
word
were
better
easier
too
a
thousand
times
to
say
i
can
tell
you
all
fears
doubts
unheeding
while
i
can
be
near
you
hold
your
hand
looking
right
into
your
eyes
and
reading
reassurance
that
you
understand
yet
i
wrote
it
through
then
lingered
thinking
of
its
reaching
you
what
hour
what
day
till
i
felt
my
heart
and
courage
sinking
with
a
strange
new
wondering
dismay
then
i
leant
against
the
casement
turning
tearful
eyes
towards
the
west
where
the
golden
evening
light
was
burning
till
my
heart
throbbed
back
again
to
rest
and
i
thought
soul
is
not
in
fetters
neither
space
nor
time
keep
souls
apart
since
i
can
not
dare
not
send
my
letters
through
the
silence
i
will
send
my
heart
will
hear
while
twilight
shades
infold
her
all
the
gathered
love
she
knows
so
well
deepest
love
my
words
have
ever
told
her
deeper
still
all
i
could
never
tell
at
the
strange
mysterious
power
that
has
touched
her
heart
then
she
will
say
some
one
whom
i
love
this
very
hour
thinks
of
me
and
loves
me
far
away
so
i
dreamed
and
watched
the
stars
far
splendour
glimmering
on
the
azure
darkness
start
while
the
star
of
trust
rose
bright
and
tender
through
the
twilight
shadows
of
my
heart
i
must
go
and
tell
mamma
that
i
shall
marry
loyal
after
all
said
the
blushing
helen
gliding
from
the
room
and
then
kathleen
turned
to
her
other
letter
it
was
superscribed
in
a
strange
hand
feminine
yet
bold
and
dashing
it
is
a
strange
hand
kathleen
said
to
herself
as
she
tore
it
open
but
stranger
yet
were
the
words
it
contained
strange
few
mysterious
if
you
wish
to
have
full
proof
of
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
man
you
love
come
alone
at
twilight
this
evening
to
the
old
cooper
where
i
am
dying
i
can
not
survive
the
night
do
not
hesitate
about
coming
i
know
that
a
beautiful
young
girl
like
you
will
do
and
dare
all
for
love
and
happiness
and
it
is
that
you
should
know
what
i
have
to
tell
you
if
i
die
with
the
secret
untold
you
will
forever
rue
it
come
without
fail
secretly
and
destroy
this
letter
one
who
knows
all
kathleen
read
and
reread
this
strange
letter
with
fascinated
eyes
i
know
the
old
cooper
she
murmured
it
is
on
the
old
country
road
where
we
used
to
drive
so
often
near
the
glen
and
the
waterfall
i
have
seen
old
myron
cooper
too
that
strange
old
man
with
his
long
gray
duster
people
said
he
wrote
poetry
as
wild
and
gloomy
as
the
glen
where
he
lived
yes
i
will
go
although
they
say
the
old
mill
is
haunted
after
nightfall
but
my
unknown
correspondent
is
right
a
young
girl
will
do
and
dare
much
for
love
love
that
mighty
passion
that
moves
the
whole
world
she
spent
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
restless
thought
longing
for
the
hour
to
come
when
she
should
go
upon
her
strange
mission
and
yet
half
ashamed
of
the
longing
to
know
all
the
truth
about
her
lover
why
is
it
that
i
can
not
trust
him
wholly
she
asked
herself
but
the
reckless
curiosity
of
a
woman
nature
drove
her
forward
on
that
perilous
quest
fraught
with
mystery
and
danger
i
must
she
declared
passionately
to
herself
chapter
lxvii
teddy
love
letters
closely
shut
within
my
chamber
where
the
fire
is
burning
bright
all
these
letters
long
since
written
i
must
read
and
burn
i
wonder
what
has
detained
jack
wren
he
promised
to
be
here
this
evening
at
five
sharp
here
it
is
six
teddy
darrell
said
impatiently
as
he
looked
at
his
watch
then
lingered
dreamily
a
moment
over
the
fair
face
of
kathleen
smiling
up
at
him
from
within
the
golden
lid
sweet
darling
in
a
few
more
days
she
will
be
mine
he
murmured
and
forgot
jack
wren
in
sweet
anticipations
of
his
now
near
at
hand
teddy
was
waiting
in
his
rooms
for
the
detective
and
now
to
beguile
the
time
he
took
some
letters
from
his
inside
pocket
and
began
to
run
over
their
perfumed
contents
smiling
softly
now
and
then
to
himself
then
he
got
up
walked
about
the
room
shook
himself
together
and
sighed
then
laughed
poor
little
dears
it
hard
to
give
you
up
after
all
the
little
dears
probably
referred
to
teddy
old
sweethearts
whose
names
were
legion
such
a
string
of
them
there
was
hatties
helens
lauras
gussies
saras
emmies
roses
fredas
annies
nellies
katies
lenas
noras
mauds
nannies
and
so
on
through
a
list
of
the
belles
and
beauties
of
several
seasons
whose
letters
and
photographs
were
treasured
in
teddy
desk
soon
to
be
ruefully
sacrificed
to
the
for
benedict
the
married
man
must
not
carry
any
of
these
sentimental
mementoes
of
the
past
into
his
new
life
here
a
dainty
letter
still
retains
its
faint
perfume
but
the
little
hand
that
wrote
it
molders
in
a
foreign
tomb
close
beside
it
lies
another
in
an
awkward
girlish
hand
desperately
sentimental
ah
i
now
can
understand
just
how
silly
two
such
lovers
as
we
were
then
must
have
been
she
about
a
year
my
junior
i
a
youngster
just
nineteen
teddy
unlocked
a
drawer
of
his
desk
and
brought
out
a
miscellaneous
pile
of
letters
photographs
faded
flowers
and
locks
of
hair
of
every
shade
known
to
woman
head
i
am
ashamed
to
record
it
of
prospective
bridegroom
that
he
cast
glances
of
unfeigned
regret
at
these
treasures
as
he
prepared
to
devote
them
to
the
flames
a
sacrifice
on
the
altar
of
his
love
for
kathleen
how
he
lingered
over
those
pretty
photographs
over
rose
the
beautiful
actress
in
the
dress
she
had
worn
as
iza
in
the
clemenceau
case
ah
rose
was
a
model
girl
he
laughed
as
he
laid
it
down
and
turned
to
stately
laura
in
the
gown
the
very
envy
of
all
her
feminine
friends
when
she
wore
it
to
madame
frivolity
ball
next
to
it
was
gussie
with
her
sweet
and
serious
face
the
dark
curls
lying
softly
against
her
temples
the
dimpled
white
shoulders
peeping
above
the
little
sleeves
of
that
simple
white
lace
dress
in
which
teddy
had
liked
her
best
he
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
the
girlish
face
and
a
memory
came
to
him
of
that
moonlight
evening
in
the
arbor
when
gussie
arms
had
clung
about
his
neck
drawing
his
dark
handsome
face
down
close
to
hers
while
the
eyes
gazed
tenderly
into
his
dark
ones
as
she
whispered
in
answer
to
his
question
my
dear
old
dark
eyes
i
love
upon
my
soul
i
believe
that
flirtation
hit
me
hard
she
was
the
sweetest
of
them
all
and
i
was
almost
sorry
i
let
her
marry
bob
ah
well
gussie
dear
i
too
shall
be
married
soon
and
these
memories
of
ours
must
be
tossed
into
the
of
the
past
he
sorted
out
letters
and
placed
them
with
her
picture
in
a
secret
drawer
for
he
had
a
lingering
fondness
for
his
old
sweetheart
pretty
gussie
the
famous
novelist
i
will
just
keep
these
he
said
i
do
believe
kathleen
would
care
for
she
reads
and
loves
gussie
novels
and
if
anything
should
happen
that
i
do
not
marry
kathleen
and
it
was
strange
the
way
she
acted
about
chainey
i
should
like
to
know
i
have
these
still
he
gathered
all
his
mementoes
and
with
a
genuine
sigh
flung
them
upon
the
glowing
blaze
it
is
but
just
to
kathleen
he
said
trying
to
stifle
his
regret
back
the
mists
of
years
are
rolling
as
these
relics
of
the
past
with
a
wondrous
fascination
have
their
spells
around
me
cast
crowds
of
tender
recollections
fill
my
eyes
with
unshed
tears
dimmer
grows
the
glowing
future
dimmer
till
it
disappears
teddy
had
a
warm
heart
and
it
was
no
disloyalty
to
kathleen
that
made
him
sigh
so
sadly
he
would
not
have
exchanged
her
for
any
other
girl
he
had
ever
loved
but
somehow
the
thought
of
gussie
haunted
him
she
had
been
his
first
love
and
it
was
a
lover
quarrel
that
had
driven
them
asunder
that
was
several
years
ago
and
now
she
was
married
and
a
shining
literary
light
but
it
was
quite
certain
that
if
ever
kathleen
had
a
rival
in
teddy
thoughts
it
would
be
this
one
lost
love
a
loud
rap
at
the
door
startled
him
it
was
jack
wren
who
entered
in
haste
with
an
excited
face
i
had
quite
given
you
up
wren
said
teddy
startled
out
of
his
tender
recollections
darrell
come
with
me
we
have
no
time
to
lose
i
have
made
a
startling
discovery
i
have
a
cab
waiting
below
and
you
must
come
with
me
to
the
rescue
of
one
you
love
for
she
is
at
this
moment
in
peril
of
her
life
i
have
been
on
ivan
belmont
track
ever
since
i
saw
you
and
he
and
fedora
who
escaped
from
the
prison
when
the
cyclone
shattered
it
are
together
now
at
cooper
in
wild
cat
glen
plotting
a
terrible
crime
breathlessly
answered
jack

chapter
lxviii
in
mortal
peril
listen
to
the
all
the
live
long
day
how
the
clinking
of
the
mill
wears
the
hours
away
people
always
wondered
why
old
cooper
ever
built
his
in
so
wild
a
place
as
that
lonely
glen
but
the
scene
the
crazy
old
building
and
the
strange
old
man
all
seemed
to
chime
together
and
no
one
was
surprised
that
when
he
died
he
expressed
the
wish
to
be
buried
in
the
glen
close
to
the
old
mill
that
his
dreamless
rest
might
be
soothed
by
the
sound
of
the
grinding
wheel
day
by
day
madame
rumor
said
that
the
old
man
ghost
haunted
the
wild
forbidding
gorge
and
kathleen
shuddered
with
dread
as
she
climbed
up
the
rocky
path
with
the
cascade
tumbling
wildly
beneath
on
her
rendezvous
with
her
unknown
correspondent
she
had
come
within
half
a
mile
in
a
cab
which
she
left
waiting
for
her
while
she
made
the
rest
of
the
journey
on
foot
to
escape
helen
kind
inquiries
she
had
said
she
was
going
to
spend
the
night
with
stone
which
she
really
intended
doing
on
her
return
how
gloomy
the
old
mill
looked
in
the
pallor
of
the
swiftly
falling
night
all
winter
the
snows
had
held
it
bound
in
an
icy
thrall
but
now
the
april
sun
had
sent
the
mass
of
foaming
dashing
water
tumbling
over
the
falls
and
turned
the
old
saw
what
a
scene
for
a
crime
thought
kathleen
with
a
thrill
of
superstitious
dread
as
she
hurried
on
in
the
deepening
gloom
casting
furtive
glances
about
her
as
though
she
expected
to
see
cooper
disembodied
spirit
hovering
near
frightened
and
nervous
she
half
regretted
that
she
had
come
and
at
the
hooting
of
an
owl
in
the
tree
near
by
she
uttered
a
frightened
scream
which
rang
through
the
gloomy
glen
in
hollow
reverberating
echoes
and
fell
prostrate
on
the
ground
an
icy
fear
seemed
to
clutch
her
heart
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
no
strength
to
rise
to
go
on
the
gloom
the
darkness
coupled
with
the
mystery
of
the
whole
affair
began
to
weigh
with
crushing
force
upon
her
spirits
she
laid
her
fair
golden
head
down
on
the
rough
stones
and
prayed
piteously
dear
god
give
me
strength
to
go
on
to
bear
whatever
is
before
me
for
oh
i
love
him
so
i
love
him
so
and
i
know
if
he
is
worthy
of
that
love
if
he
is
not
if
they
tell
me
he
is
guilty
of
that
sin
with
which
fedora
accused
him
dear
god
let
me
die
i
can
not
live
and
know
him
false
and
wicked
i
would
sooner
throw
myself
over
those
rocks
down
into
the
terrible
cascade
and
end
my
wretched
young
life
new
courage
came
with
that
incoherent
prayer
and
struggling
to
her
feet
she
tottered
on
murmuring
faintly
oh
ralph
dear
ralph
how
much
i
must
love
you
to
risk
so
much
for
your
sake
she
gained
the
threshold
at
last
with
a
hopeful
glance
upward
at
the
feeble
glimmering
light
in
the
window
she
knocked
upon
the
door
it
was
jerked
rudely
open
on
the
instant
and
kathleen
saw
before
her
a
old
woman
with
a
short
clay
pipe
in
her
mouth
this
repulsive
old
woman
thrust
out
a
hand
and
dragged
the
trembling
girl
into
the
mill
what
made
you
so
long
i
been
expecting
you
more
than
an
hour
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
savage
anger
not
waiting
for
an
answer
she
dragged
the
girl
rudely
along
with
her
into
a
small
room
and
turning
quickly
slipped
the
bolt
into
the
lock
kathleen
gave
a
startled
glance
around
the
room
no
one
was
there
but
the
old
hag
who
was
gazing
at
her
with
malicious
eyes
in
whose
tigerish
gleam
of
hate
there
was
something
so
strangely
familiar
that
she
shuddered
with
terror
and
a
name
leaped
to
her
lips
fedora
yes
fedora
but
you
have
keen
eyes
to
see
through
this
disguise
cried
the
woman
do
you
remember
i
told
you
i
would
murder
you
if
i
ever
got
out
of
prison
well
i
shall
keep
my
vow
she
sprung
savagely
toward
her
but
at
the
cruel
grasp
of
her
foe
kathleen
uttered
a
moan
of
horror
and
slipped
limply
to
the
floor
like
one
already
dead
is
she
dead
so
easily
i
hope
not
for
i
want
to
torture
her
first
hissed
fedora
spurning
the
prostrate
body
with
her
foot
she
tore
open
the
door
at
a
slight
tap
upon
it
and
stood
face
to
face
with
ivan
belmont
he
spoke
hurriedly
ralph
chainey
is
coming
fedora
quick
lock
the
girl
in
and
come
out
and
meet
him
alone
i
must
not
be
seen
yet
fedora
obeyed
him
and
kathleen
coming
back
to
life
with
a
shuddering
gasp
found
herself
alone
locked
in
and
heard
outside
the
voice
of
her
lover
and
the
words
spoken
held
her
kathleen
where
is
kathleen
she
told
me
to
meet
her
here
with
a
hissing
laugh
of
savage
hate
fedora
flung
off
the
hood
that
she
wore
and
stood
revealed
scarred
hideous
but
fedora
still
the
woman
who
held
his
honor
in
her
light
keeping
and
bore
his
name
kathleen
is
dead
she
laughed
dead
and
i
killed
her
without
a
blow
my
weapon
was
a
lie
it
slew
her
as
fatally
as
a
dagger
he
could
not
speak
he
could
only
stare
at
her
in
dumb
horror
as
she
continued
do
you
see
these
diamonds
flashing
in
my
ears
they
are
the
ones
that
were
stolen
from
kathleen
carew
the
night
of
the
attempted
murder
when
you
found
and
saved
her
at
lincoln
station
i
told
her
that
you
my
husband
did
that
foul
deed
and
robbing
her
of
her
money
and
jewels
brought
them
to
me
a
fiendish
lie
you
say
ha
ha
but
it
killed
her
all
the
same
do
you
want
to
know
the
real
thief
it
was
ivan
belmont
my
lover
and
she
was
slain
by
a
lie
kathleen
had
struggled
with
difficulty
to
her
feet
she
tottered
to
the
little
window
that
looked
into
the
mill
she
saw
her
noble
handsome
face
and
uttered
a
piercing
cry
ralph
ralph
i
am
here
save
me
save
me
he
sprung
toward
the
voice
the
movement
was
fatal
ivan
belmont
had
stolen
up
softly
behind
him
bearing
a
heavy
mallet
in
his
hand
a
moment
more
and
it
was
lifted
high
in
air
and
anguished
eyes
beheld
her
darling
struck
down
before
her
into
apparent
death
kathleen
would
never
forget
the
horror
of
that
moment
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
went
mad
with
grief
and
terror
shriek
after
shriek
burst
from
her
lips
and
she
beat
her
little
hands
wildly
against
the
smoky
little
struggling
wildly
to
get
free
but
the
fiends
before
her
did
not
heed
her
cries
between
them
they
lifted
the
inanimate
form
of
their
victim
and
bearing
it
a
short
distance
away
but
in
full
view
of
the
window
they
laid
it
on
a
plank
upon
a
table
in
front
of
the
large
steel
circular
saw
kathleen
saw
his
arms
fall
limply
to
his
side
and
the
dark
curly
head
drop
back
heavily
the
face
the
closed
eyes
assured
her
that
he
was
either
in
a
deep
swoon
or
already
dead
from
the
terrible
blow
that
had
felled
him
to
the
ground
hushing
the
piercing
shrieks
upon
her
blanched
lips
kathleen
watched
in
terrible
suspense
the
movements
of
the
two
fiends
perhaps
they
doubted
whether
their
victim
was
already
dead
for
they
bent
over
him
feeling
his
pulse
and
listening
for
his
heart
he
lives
ivan
belmont
said
with
fiendish
joy
let
us
bind
him
hand
and
foot
and
leave
him
on
the
plank
till
he
revives
i
want
to
enjoy
his
agony
when
he
realizes
the
awful
death
that
lies
before
him
he
must
know
that
kathleen
is
here
that
she
will
witness
his
death
and
then
meet
the
same
horrible
fate
it
was
a
scene
on
which
the
devils
in
hell
might
have
gloated
the
old
mill
with
its
dim
lights
and
strange
flickering
shadows
the
prostrate
man
with
his
face
the
two
fiends
binding
him
with
strong
cords
lest
he
should
recover
and
escape
their
vengeful
fury
and
looking
on
with
anguished
eyes
at
the
doom
of
her
beloved
was
our
beautiful
kathleen
he
revives
hissed
fedora
good
laughed
ivan
hoarsely
and
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
at
kathleen
convulsed
almost
supernaturally
pale
face
at
the
window
ha
ha
my
proud
lady

would
send
me
to

stealing

diamonds

deep
dark
river

fate

decoyed
both
you

your
lover

revenge
upon
you
both
do

glittering
saw
with
its
hungry
teeth
waiting
to
cut
your
delicate
body
to
atoms
and
drink
your
well
we
are
only
waiting
for
you
to
see
your
lover
dead
before
we
devote
you
to
the
same
torture
he
is
dead
already
you
say

that
tremor
creep
along
his
frame

his
eyelids

his
eyes

anguish
on
his
face
how
happy
it
makes
me
look
fedora
at
his
tortures

we
not
already
avenged
her
answer
was
a
laugh
of
fiendish
triumph
oh

it
is
glorious

i
am
in
no
haste
for
their
death
i
like
to
see
them
suffering
like
this
i
want
to
prolong
their
torture
she
exclaimed
what
do
you
say
dear
ivan
shall
we
let
them
live
a
few
hours
yet
to
realize
the
horrors
that
surround
them
what
avails
their
love
their
beauty
their
wealth
now
they
will
be
lifeless
clods
and
i
the
rich
widow
mrs
chainey
baffled
said
a
hoarse
triumphant
voice
and
turning
she
met
ralph
chainey
burning
gaze
you
mistake
said
her
victim
faintly
but
audibly
i
made
my
will
weeks
ago
and
divided
my
whole
fortune
between
my
mother
and
kathleen
a
scream
of
baffled
fury
escaped
her
lips
but
ivan
said
quickly
you
can
contest
the
will
fedora
yes
i
will
fight
for
my
rights
to
the
bitter
end
she
shrieked
then
sprung
toward
him
in
a
fury
let
us
end
this
farce
let
us
show
them
no
further
mercy
he
dies
now
ivan
go
set
the
saw
in
motion
he
moved
forward
in
eager
obedience
to
her
order
and
ralph
chainey
realized
that
his
moments
were
indeed
numbered
and
that
death
in
the
most
horrible
and
shape
was
approaching
he
made
an
almost
superhuman
effort
to
burst
the
bonds
that
held
him
fast
but
the
attempt
was
useless
he
was
weakened
by
the
illness
through
which
he
had
just
passed
and
could
not
move
with
a
prayer
in
his
heart
to
heaven
he
turned
his
dark
despairing
eyes
toward
the
beautiful
anguished
face
at
the
window
courage
my
own
love
he
called
to
her
bravely
death
is
but
a
fleeting
pang
and
then
it
will
be
life
forever
turn
your
sweet
eyes
away
my
own
kathleen
do
not
torture
yourself
with
the
sight
of
my
fate
you
will
come
to
me
soon
and
we
his
voice
broke
drowned
by
the
whir
of
the
wheel
as
it
began
its
revolutions
slowly
drawing
the
plank
with
its
doomed
victim
within
its
jaws
oh
god
what
a
moment
surely
the
pitying
angels
who
know
and
see
all
things
hovered
near
and
aided
weak
despairing
kathleen
in
her
frantic
struggle
for
liberty
as
ivan
belmont
stepped
out
to
open
the
she
sprung
with
a
strength
born
of
despair
against
the
door
the
rusty
lock
yielded
to
her
onslaught
the
door
fell
crashing
beneath
her
weight
and
staggering
tottering
her
loosened
golden
hair
flying
like
a
banner
behind
her
kathleen
fled
across
the
moonlit
space
the
torturing
sound
of
the
revolving
wheel
grating
on
her
ears
the
flying
sawdust
blinding
her
eyes
and
gained
his
side
brave
kathleen
noble
kathleen
you
are
not
a
second
too
soon
the
swift
revolutions
of
the
saw
are
drawing
your
doomed
lover
closer
to
the
encroaching
steel
throw
out
in
an
agony
those
fair
white
arms
gifted
with
such
momentary
wondrous
strength
grasp
your
loved
one
wildly
eagerly
and
draw
him
madly
from
his
couch
of
deadly
peril
saved
and
watching
angels
weep
joyful
tears
at
the
victory
of
love
over
hate
and
revenge
fedora
dazed
with
wonder
mad
with
rage
darted
forward
to
thwart
kathleen
angelic
purpose
but
heaven
had
interposed
ere
she
reached
them
kathleen
frenzied
hands
had
dragged
ralph
from
the
fatal
plank
his
falling
body
struck
the
fiend
tripping
and
throwing
her
violently
upon
the
cruel
saw
blindly
she
threw
up
her
arms
shrieked
in
demoniac
fear
and
then
there
came
a
horrible
grating
sound
the
sickening
smell
of
fresh
blood
spurting
into
the
air
and
fedora
headless
body
fell
with
an
awful
thud
upon
the
floor
while
from
the
gloom
beyond
there
followed
upon
her
dying
shriek
the
sound
of
and
men
angry
voices
jack
wren
and
teddy
darrell
had
arrived
upon
the
scene
but
only
that
the
heavenly
hosts
had
helped
kathleen
they
would
have
come
too
late
ivan
belmont
in
the
midst
of
his
exultation
over
his
terrible
crime
had
met
a
swift
retribution
turning
to
rejoin
fedora
and
gloat
with
her
over
the
destruction
of
their
victims
he
was
confronted
by
the
detective
and
teddy
darrell
snatching
a
pistol
from
his
breast
he
fired
at
the
foremost
one
and
received
in
return
a
fatal
bullet
from
the
ready
weapon
of
the
dashing
detective
he
fell
dead
and
his
soul
wandered
forth
on
the
wings
of
the
night
with
that
of
fedora
to
the
realms
of
darkness
and
eternal
gloom
hastening
into
the
mill
in
search
of
kathleen
the
two
men
were
horrified
to
find
upon
the
floor
the
ghastly
decapitated
body
of
fedora
in
another
moment
they
saw
near
at
hand
the
inanimate
forms
of
ralph
and
kathleen
oh
heaven
we
are
too
late
they
are
all
dead
exclaimed
teddy
in
anguish
but
a
low
moan
from
kathleen
arrested
him
he
stooped
over
his
beautiful
betrothed
and
lifted
her
in
his
arms
she
opened
her
eyes
but
they
gazed
blankly
into
his
and
kathleen
murmured
gladly
ralph
darling
i
have
saved
you
from
a
terrible
death
thank
god
thank
god
for
i
love
only
you
and
had
you
died
i
should
have
gone
mad
with
grief
teddy
darrell
started
and
shivered
but
the
arms
that
held
kathleen
did
not
let
her
fall
only
pressed
her
closer
to
his
throbbing
heart
she
loves
ralph
chainey
that
is
the
key
to
the
mystery
of
her
coldness
for
me
he
murmured
sadly
oh
my
beautiful
love
must
i
then
lose
you
i
loved
you
so
and
i
would
have
tried
to
make
you
so
happy
must
i
give
you
up
and
only
the
pitying
angels
knew
the
pang
that
rent
his
heart
chapter
lxix
i
take
you
home
again
kathleen
i
know
you
love
me
kathleen
dear
your
heart
was
ever
fond
and
true
i
always
feel
when
you
are
near
that
life
holds
nothing
dear
but
you
oh
i
will
take
you
back
kathleen
to
where
your
heart
will
feel
no
pain
and
when
the
fields
are
fresh
and
green
i
take
you
to
your
home
again
thomas
westendorf
but
true
love
is
never
selfish
teddy
darrell
heart
bore
that
cruel
wrench
gravely
and
in
silence
they
took
ralph
and
kathleen
home
and
a
few
days
later
when
the
girl
was
stronger
and
better
her
noble
young
betrothed
came
to
her
and
bravely
gave
her
back
her
promise
i
know
all
your
love
for
ralph
he
said
i
know
how
bravely
you
have
held
to
your
promise
to
me
i
have
not
one
unkind
thought
of
you
dear
and
i
give
you
back
your
vow
for
i
know
you
would
be
happier
with
him
than
me
but
think
sometimes
of
me
kathleen
for
i
shall
always
love
you
he
meant
what
he
said
and
he
thought
it
would
be
so
but
something
happened
just
a
few
weeks
later
that
changed
all
the
world
to
handsome
teddy
darrell
far
away
in
a
beautiful
southern
home
where
the
magnolias
bloomed
and
the
orange
groves
drooped
their
white
blossoms
down
on
her
dark
head
a
beautiful
young
widow
laid
aside
her
pen
too
often
to
dream
of
one
who
had
been
her
lover
in
the
dear
old
days
before
that
fatal
quarrel
had
driven
her
into
a
marriage
for
pique
with
the
proud
rich
man
who
had
now
been
lying
for
more
than
a
year
beneath
a
costly
granite
shaft
in
howard
cemetery
in
a
magazine
that
she
had
been
reading
some
sweet
sad
lines
had
touched
her
heart
obeying
an
uncontrollable
impulse
she
drew
pen
and
ink
toward
her
exclaiming
what
if
i
copy
these
sweet
sad
verses
and
send
them
to
my
dear
old
dark
eyes
he
is
not
married
yet
i
know
and
i
will
send
him
the
notice
of
bob
death
with
the
verses
for
i
love
ted
still
and
i
would
give
the
world
to
win
him
back
and
so
the
letter
came
to
teddy
from
that
southern
home
and
he
read
with
tender
eyes
the
little
poem
entitled
dark
eyes
which
it
contained
which
eyes
do
i
love
the
best
dark
or
blue
or
gray
each
are
beautiful
and
blest
in
their
way
but
i
think
if
some
sweet
soul
dearer
to
us
than
the
rest
shone
through
light
or
dark
we
love
color
best
one
i
loved
in
happier
days
under
happier
skies
one
whose
looks
breathed
only
praise
had
eyes
darkly
radiant
eyes
that
rest
nevermore
to
wake
and
i
love
eyes
the
best
for
sake
dark
eyes
oh
you
haunt
me
yet
with
your
magic
splendor
all
my
heart
holds
one
regret
deep
and
tender
oft
you
come
as
all
sweet
things
come
as
the
scent
of
roses
brings
dead
perfume
as
the
sadly
dying
strain
of
a
song
we
used
to
know
stirs
the
heart
to
sudden
pain
you
come
and
go
shining
on
me
in
my
dreams
with
the
light
you
used
to
wear
deepening
with
your
starlight
beams
my
despair
till
the
sad
heart
in
my
breast
throbbing
seems
to
break
and
i
love
dark
eyes
the
best
his
teddy
dark
eyes
grew
dim
but
he
smiled
as
he
exclaimed
bob
had
blue
eyes
so
she
must
mean
for
she
used
to
call
me
her
eyes
poor
fellow
i
sorry
he
died
but
i
do
believe
all
the
old
love
for
gussie
is
coming
back
again
i
take
the
first
for
the
south
and
sure
enough
it
was
only
a
few
months
later
that
he
bore
away
from
the
crescent
city
the
fairest
flower
of
the
magnolia
state
his
bonny
bride
but
it
was
long
before
teddy
that
he
had
cards
to
attend
a
grand
reception
at
the
carew
mansion
on
commonwealth
avenue
it
seemed
that
carew
really
meant
to
stay
abroad
for
years
for
madame
rumor
said
in
a
week
after
their
departure
that
the
handsome
old
house
had
been
rented
to
a
rich
and
eccentric
old
man
a
relative
of
the
late
vincent
carew
kathleen
herself
was
surprised
when
she
received
that
letter
from
uncle
ben
far
away
in
his
country
home
telling
her
all
about
it
i
wanted
to
give
you
a
big
party
on
your
betrothal
to
that
grand
young
actor
ralph
chainey
my
dear
so
i
rented
the
house
from
the
agent
and
i
want
you
to
be
sure
to
come
kathleen
he
wrote
never
mind
about
buying
a
new
dress
dear
uncle
ben
is
not
as
poor
as
he
looks
and
you
must
come
in
your
dress
go
up
to
your
own
old
room
and
you
will
find
there
a
new
dress
and
jewels
a
gift
from
uncle
ben
to
know
that
uncle
ben
was
rich
was
surprise
enough
but
when
helen
and
kathleen
arrived
with
fox
and
stone
at
the
mansion
she
was
transported
with
joy
to
meet
in
the
hall
her
aunt
franklyn
her
cousin
chester
and
beautiful
happy
daisy
lynn
uncle
ben
invited
us
on
a
long
visit
they
exclaimed
and
hurried
her
upstairs
to
the
beautiful
rooms
once
her
own
but
to
which
for
almost
two
years
kathleen
had
been
a
stranger
kathleen
now
the
happy
promised
bride
of
noble
ralph
chainey
could
not
keep
back
the
tender
tears
as
she
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
familiar
rooms
but
daisy
wiped
them
away
begging
her
to
look
at
her
new
dress
the
people
will
be
coming
presently
and
you
do
want
chainey
to
see
you
with
pink
rims
around
your
beautiful
dark
eyes
she
said
gayly
and
hurried
her
into
the
beautiful
white
dress
costly
enough
for
a
bride
and
here
are
these
diamonds
kathleen
that
he
gave
you
to
replace
those
that
you
lost
by
the
villainy
of
ivan
belmont
continued
daisy
lifting
a
set
of
glorious
diamonds
from
their
white
velvet
bed
they
slipped
through
her
white
fingers
like
rivers
of
light
and
kathleen
uttered
a
cry
of
rapture
they
are
worth
a
fortune
oh
how
good
uncle
ben
is
to
me
i
must
put
them
on
and
go
down
to
him
daisy
but
when
she
was
going
along
the
hall
in
the
beautiful
robes
she
paused
suddenly
at
the
library
door
daisy
i
must
go
in
alone
to
see
papa
portrait
first
she
said
and
tears
came
into
the
lovely
eyes
as
she
crossed
the
threshold
again
she
knelt
before
the
portrait
weeping
for
the
loved
and
lost
but
suddenly
uncle
ben
came
in
and
stood
by
her
side
he
wronged
you
my
darling
and
left
you
to
fight
the
bitter
battle
of
poverty
alone
how
can
you
forgive
him
she
put
her
hand
in
his
and
answered
sweetly
my
was
to
blame
i
sure
uncle
ben
and
so
i
have
never
harbored
one
unkind
thought
of
my
dear
dead
father
and
oh
what
would
i
not
give
if
he
were
alive
to
bless
ralph
and
me
in
our
happiness
my
angel
daughter
cried
the
old
man
and
he
flung
aside
the
disfiguring
disguises
in
which
he
had
masqueraded
while
unmasking
his
wicked
wife
there
he
stood
tall
dark
and
handsome
although
with
a
sadness
that
would
never
leave
his
face
vincent
carew
her
beloved
father
she
flew
to
his
arms
and
they
had
a
blessed
half
hour
of
sacred
rejoicing
and
love
then
there
came
a
light
rap
on
the
door
it
was
ralph
chainey
handsome
as
a
prince
in
his
evening
suit
they
told
me
to
come
here
for
you
my
darling
oh
how
beautiful
you
are
he
cried
taking
her
into
his
arms
vincent
carew
came
forward
into
the
light
see
papa
has
come
back
to
me
she
said
and
he
smiled
on
the
pair
of
lovers
he
had
had
a
rooted
antipathy
to
actors
but
for
sake
he
was
willing
to
accept
ralph
chainey
for
a
beloved
kathleen
had
whispered
to
him
that
she
was
to
marry
her
lover
soon
and
he
shook
hands
most
cordially
now
with
the
young
man
ere
he
turned
away
and
left
them
together
for
a
few
sweet
moments
before
they
joined
the
guests
ralph
took
beautiful
kathleen
in
his
fond
arms
and
kissed
that
radiant
face
with
adoring
love
my
love
my
bride
so
soon
to
be
he
whispered
and
then
she
drew
him
away
we
must
go
although
i
had
rather
stay
here
with
you
dear
love
she
whispered
and
they
went
along
the
hall
arm
in
arm
happiest
lovers
the
world
ever
knew
daisy
lynn
was
singing
at
the
piano
when
they
entered
the
crowded
it
was
a
song
that
vincent
carew
had
chosen
the
words
rang
out
in
sweet
and
jubilant
echoes
on
the
air
i
take
you
home
again
kathleen

the
ocean
wild
and
wide
to
where
your
heart
has
ever
been
since
first
you
