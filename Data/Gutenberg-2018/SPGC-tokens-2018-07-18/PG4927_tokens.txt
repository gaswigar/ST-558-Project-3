preface
no
new
edition
of
bulfinch
classic
work
can
be
considered
complete
without
some
notice
of
the
american
scholar
to
whose
wide
erudition
and
painstaking
care
it
stands
as
a
perpetual
monument
the
age
of
fable
has
come
to
be
ranked
with
older
books
like
pilgrim
progress
gulliver
travels
the
arabian
nights
robinson
crusoe
and
five
or
six
other
productions
of
renown
as
a
work
with
which
every
one
must
claim
some
acquaintance
before
his
education
can
be
called
really
complete
many
readers
of
the
present
edition
will
probably
recall
coming
in
contact
with
the
work
as
children
and
it
may
be
added
will
no
doubt
discover
from
a
fresh
perusal
the
source
of
numerous
bits
of
knowledge
that
have
remained
stored
in
their
minds
since
those
early
years
yet
to
the
majority
of
this
great
circle
of
readers
and
students
the
name
bulfinch
in
itself
has
no
significance
thomas
bulfinch
was
a
native
of
boston
where
he
was
born
in
his
boyhood
was
spent
in
that
city
and
he
prepared
for
college
in
the
boston
schools
he
finished
his
scholastic
training
at
harvard
college
and
after
taking
his
degree
was
for
a
period
a
teacher
in
his
home
city
for
a
long
time
later
in
life
he
was
employed
as
an
accountant
in
the
boston
merchants
bank
his
leisure
time
he
used
for
further
pursuit
of
the
classical
studies
which
he
had
begun
at
harvard
and
his
chief
pleasure
in
life
lay
in
writing
out
the
results
of
his
reading
in
simple
condensed
form
for
young
or
busy
readers
the
plan
he
followed
in
this
work
to
give
it
the
greatest
possible
usefulness
is
set
forth

scrupulous
care
has
been
taken
to
follow
the
original
text
of
bulfinch
but
attention
should
be
called
to
some
additional
sections
which
have
been
inserted
to
add
to
the
rounded
completeness
of
the
work
and
which
the
publishers
believe
would
meet
with
the
sanction
of
the
author
himself
as
in
no
way
intruding
upon
his
original
plan
but
simply
carrying
it
out
in
more
complete
detail
the
section
on
northern
mythology
has
been
enlarged
by
a
retelling
of
the
epic
of
the
nibelungen
lied
together
with
a
summary
of
wagner
version
of
the
legend
in
his
series
of
under
the
head
of
hero
myths
of
the
british
race
have
been
included
outlines
of
the
stories
of
beowulf
cuchulain
hereward
the
wake
and
robin
hood
of
the
verse
extracts
which
occur
throughout
the
text
thirty
or
more
have
been
added
from
literature
which
has
appeared
since
bulfinch
time
extracts
that
he
would
have
been
likely
to
quote
had
he
personally
supervised
the
new
edition
finally
the
index
has
been
thoroughly
overhauled
and
indeed
remade
all
the
proper
names
in
the
work
have
been
entered
with
references
to
the
pages
where
they
occur
and
a
concise
explanation
or
definition
of
each
has
been
given
thus
what
was
a
mere
list
of
names
in
the
original
has
been
enlarged
into
a
small
classical
and
mythological
dictionary
which
it
is
hoped
will
prove
valuable
for
reference
purposes
not
necessarily
connected
with
the
age
of
fable
acknowledgments
are
due
the
writings
of
oliver
huckel
for
information
on
the
point
of
wagner
rendering
of
the
nibelungen
legend
and
ebbutt
authoritative
volume
on
hero
myths
and
legends
of
the
british
race
from
which
much
of
the
information
concerning
the
british
heroes
has
been
obtained
author
preface
if
no
other
knowledge
deserves
to
be
called
useful
but
that
which
helps
to
enlarge
our
possessions
or
to
raise
our
station
in
society
then
mythology
has
no
claim
to
the
appellation
but
if
that
which
tends
to
make
us
happier
and
better
can
be
called
useful
then
we
claim
that
epithet
for
our
subject
for
mythology
is
the
handmaid
of
literature
and
literature
is
one
of
the
best
allies
of
virtue
and
promoters
of
happiness
without
a
knowledge
of
mythology
much
of
the
elegant
literature
of
our
own
language
can
not
be
understood
and
appreciated
when
byron
calls
rome
the
niobe
of
nations
or
says
of
venice
she
looks
a
fresh
from
ocean
he
calls
up
to
the
mind
of
one
familiar
with
our
subject
illustrations
more
vivid
and
striking
than
the
pencil
could
furnish
but
which
are
lost
to
the
reader
ignorant
of
mythology
milton
abounds
in
similar
allusions
the
short
poem
comus
contains
more
than
thirty
such
and
the
ode
on
the
morning
of
the
nativity
half
as
many
through
paradise
lost
they
are
scattered
profusely
this
is
one
reason
why
we
often
hear
persons
by
no
means
illiterate
say
that
they
can
not
enjoy
milton
but
were
these
persons
to
add
to
their
more
solid
acquirements
the
easy
learning
of
this
little
volume
much
of
the
poetry
of
milton
which
has
appeared
to
them
harsh
and
crabbed
would
be
found
musical
as
is
apollo
lute
our
citations
taken
from
more
than
poets
from
spenser
to
longfellow
will
show
how
general
has
been
the
practice
of
borrowing
illustrations
from
mythology
the
prose
writers
also
avail
themselves
of
the
same
source
of
elegant
and
suggestive
illustration
one
can
hardly
take
up
a
number
of
the
edinburgh
or
quarterly
review
without
meeting
with
instances
in
macaulay
article
on
milton
there
are
twenty
such
but
how
is
mythology
to
be
taught
to
one
who
does
not
learn
it
through
the
medium
of
the
languages
of
greece
and
rome
to
devote
study
to
a
species
of
learning
which
relates
wholly
to
false
marvels
and
obsolete
faiths
is
not
to
be
expected
of
the
general
reader
in
a
practical
age
like
this
the
time
even
of
the
young
is
claimed
by
so
many
sciences
of
facts
and
things
that
little
can
be
spared
for
set
treatises
on
a
science
of
mere
fancy
but
may
not
the
requisite
knowledge
of
the
subject
be
acquired
by
reading
the
ancient
poets
in
translations
we
reply
the
field
is
too
extensive
for
a
preparatory
course
and
these
very
translations
require
some
previous
knowledge
of
the
subject
to
make
them
intelligible
let
any
one
who
doubts
it
read
the
first
page
of
the
aeneid
and
see
what
he
can
make
of
the
hatred
of
juno
the
decree
of
the
parcae
the
judgment
of
paris
and
the
honors
of
ganymede
without
this
knowledge
shall
we
be
told
that
answers
to
such
queries
may
be
found
in
notes
or
by
a
reference
to
the
classical
dictionary
we
reply
the
interruption
of
one
reading
by
either
process
is
so
annoying
that
most
readers
prefer
to
let
an
allusion
pass
unapprehended
rather
than
submit
to
it
moreover
such
sources
give
us
only
the
dry
facts
without
any
of
the
charm
of
the
original
narrative
and
what
is
a
poetical
myth
when
stripped
of
its
poetry
the
story
of
ceyx
and
halcyone
which
fills
a
chapter
in
our
book
occupies
but
eight
lines
in
the
best
smith
classical
dictionary
and
so
of
others
our
work
is
an
attempt
to
solve
this
problem
by
telling
the
stories
of
mythology
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
them
a
source
of
amusement
we
have
endeavored
to
tell
them
correctly
according
to
the
ancient
authorities
so
that
when
the
reader
finds
them
referred
to
he
may
not
be
at
a
loss
to
recognize
the
reference
thus
we
hope
to
teach
mythology
not
as
a
study
but
as
a
relaxation
from
study
to
give
our
work
the
charm
of
a
yet
by
means
of
it
to
impart
a
knowledge
of
an
important
branch
of
education
the
index
at
the
end
will
adapt
it
to
the
purposes
of
reference
and
make
it
a
classical
dictionary
for
the
parlor
most
of
the
classical
legends
in
stories
of
gods
and
heroes
are
derived
from
ovid
and
virgil
they
are
not
literally
translated
for
in
the
author
opinion
poetry
translated
into
literal
prose
is
very
unattractive
reading
neither
are
they
in
verse
as
well
for
other
reasons
as
from
a
conviction
that
to
translate
faithfully
under
all
the
embarrassments
of
rhyme
and
measure
is
impossible
the
attempt
has
been
made
to
tell
the
stories
in
prose
preserving
so
much
of
the
poetry
as
resides
in
the
thoughts
and
is
separable
from
the
language
itself
and
omitting
those
amplifications
which
are
not
suited
to
the
altered
form
the
northern
mythological
stories
are
copied
with
some
abridgment
from
mallet
northern
antiquities
these
chapters
with
those
on
oriental
and
egyptian
mythology
seemed
necessary
to
complete
the
subject
though
it
is
believed
these
topics
have
not
usually
been
presented
in
the
same
volume
with
the
classical
fables
the
poetical
citations
so
freely
introduced
are
expected
to
answer
several
valuable
purposes
they
will
tend
to
fix
in
memory
the
leading
fact
of
each
story
they
will
help
to
the
attainment
of
a
correct
pronunciation
of
the
proper
names
and
they
will
enrich
the
memory
with
many
gems
of
poetry
some
of
them
such
as
are
most
frequently
quoted
or
alluded
to
in
reading
and
conversation
having
chosen
mythology
as
connected
with
literature
for
our
province
we
have
endeavored
to
omit
nothing
which
the
reader
of
elegant
literature
is
likely
to
find
occasion
for
such
stories
and
parts
of
stories
as
are
offensive
to
pure
taste
and
good
morals
are
not
given
but
such
stories
are
not
often
referred
to
and
if
they
occasionally
should
be
the
english
reader
need
feel
no
mortification
in
confessing
his
ignorance
of
them
our
work
is
not
for
the
learned
nor
for
the
theologian
nor
for
the
philosopher
but
for
the
reader
of
english
literature
of
either
sex
who
wishes
to
comprehend
the
allusions
so
frequently
made
by
public
speakers
lecturers
essayists
and
poets
and
those
which
occur
in
polite
conversation
in
the
stories
of
gods
and
heroes
the
compiler
has
endeavored
to
impart
the
pleasures
of
classical
learning
to
the
english
reader
by
presenting
the
stories
of
pagan
mythology
in
a
form
adapted
to
modern
taste
in
king
arthur
and
his
knights
and
the
mabinogeon
the
attempt
has
been
made
to
treat
in
the
same
way
the
stories
of
the
second
age
of
fable
the
age
which
witnessed
the
dawn
of
the
several
states
of
modern
europe
it
is
believed
that
this
presentation
of
a
literature
which
held
unrivalled
sway
over
the
imaginations
of
our
ancestors
for
many
centuries
will
not
be
without
benefit
to
the
reader
in
addition
to
the
amusement
it
may
afford
the
tales
though
not
to
be
trusted
for
their
facts
are
worthy
of
all
credit
as
pictures
of
manners
and
it
is
beginning
to
be
held
that
the
manners
and
modes
of
thinking
of
an
age
are
a
more
important
part
of
its
history
than
the
conflicts
of
its
peoples
generally
leading
to
no
result
besides
this
the
literature
of
romance
is
a
of
poetical
material
to
which
modern
poets
frequently
resort
the
italian
poets
dante
and
ariosto
the
english
spenser
scott
and
tennyson
and
our
own
longfellow
and
lowell
are
examples
of
this
these
legends
are
so
connected
with
each
other
so
consistently
adapted
to
a
group
of
characters
strongly
individualized
in
arthur
launcelot
and
their
compeers
and
so
lighted
up
by
the
fires
of
imagination
and
invention
that
they
seem
as
well
adapted
to
the
poet
purpose
as
the
legends
of
the
greek
and
roman
mythology
and
if
every
young
person
is
expected
to
know
the
story
of
the
golden
fleece
why
is
the
quest
of
the
sangreal
less
worthy
of
his
acquaintance
or
if
an
allusion
to
the
shield
of
achilles
ought
not
to
pass
unapprehended
why
should
one
to
excalibar
the
famous
sword
of
arthur
of
arthur
who
to
upper
light
restored
with
that
terrific
sword
which
yet
he
brandishes
for
future
war
shall
lift
his
country
fame
above
the
polar
star
footnote
wordsworth
it
is
an
additional
recommendation
of
our
subject
that
it
tends
to
cherish
in
our
minds
the
idea
of
the
source
from
which
we
sprung
we
are
entitled
to
our
full
share
in
the
glories
and
recollections
of
the
land
of
our
forefathers
down
to
the
time
of
colonization
thence
the
associations
which
spring
from
this
source
must
be
fruitful
of
good
influences
among
which
not
the
least
valuable
is
the
increased
enjoyment
which
such
associations
afford
to
the
american
traveller
when
he
visits
england
and
sets
his
foot
upon
any
of
her
renowned
localities
the
legends
of
charlemagne
and
his
peers
are
necessary
to
complete
the
subject
in
an
age
when
intellectual
darkness
enveloped
western
europe
a
constellation
of
brilliant
writers
arose
in
italy
of
these
pulci
born
in
boiardo
and
ariosto
took
for
their
subjects
the
romantic
fables
which
had
for
many
ages
been
transmitted
in
the
lays
of
bards
and
the
legends
of
monkish
chroniclers
these
fables
they
arranged
in
order
adorned
with
the
embellishments
of
fancy
amplified
from
their
own
invention
and
stamped
with
immortality
it
may
safely
be
asserted
that
as
long
as
civilization
shall
endure
these
productions
will
retain
their
place
among
the
most
cherished
creations
of
human
genius
in
stories
of
gods
and
heroes
king
arthur
and
his
knights
and
the
mabinogeon
the
aim
has
been
to
supply
to
the
modern
reader
such
knowledge
of
the
fables
of
classical
and
mediaeval
literature
as
is
needed
to
render
intelligible
the
allusions
which
occur
in
reading
and
conversation
the
legends
of
charlemagne
is
intended
to
carry
out
the
same
design
like
the
earlier
portions
of
the
work
it
aspires
to
a
higher
character
than
that
of
a
piece
of
mere
amusement
it
claims
to
be
useful
in
acquainting
its
readers
with
the
subjects
of
the
productions
of
the
great
poets
of
italy
some
knowledge
of
these
is
expected
of
every
young
person
in
reading
these
romances
we
can
not
fail
to
observe
how
the
primitive
inventions
have
been
used
again
and
again
by
successive
generations
of
fabulists
the
siren
of
ulysses
is
the
prototype
of
the
siren
of
orlando
and
the
character
of
circe
reappears
in
alcina
the
fountains
of
love
and
hatred
may
be
traced
to
the
story
of
cupid
and
psyche
and
similar
effects
produced
by
a
magic
draught
appear
in
the
tale
of
tristram
and
isoude
and
substituting
a
flower
for
the
draught
in
shakspeare
midsummer
night
dream
there
are
many
other
instances
of
the
same
kind
which
the
reader
will
recognize
without
our
assistance
the
sources
whence
we
derive
these
stories
are
first
the
italian
poets
named
above
next
the
romans
de

of
the

lastly
certain

some
chapters
have
been
borrowed
from

translations
from

it
seemed
unnecessary
to

what

already
done
so
well
yet
on

other
hand
those

could
not

been
blended
in
popular
tradition
with
those
properly
belonging
to
charlemagne
it
was
indeed
a
most
momentous
era
and
if
our
readers
will
have
patience
before
entering
on
the
perusal
of
the
fabulous
annals
which
we
are
about
to
lay
before
them
to
take
a
rapid
survey
of
the
real
history
of
the
times
they
will
find
it
hardly
less
romantic
than
the
tales
of
the
poets
in
the
century
beginning
from
the
year
the
countries
bordering
upon
the
native
land
of
our
saviour
to
the
east
and
south
had
not
yet
received
his
religion
arabia
was
the
seat
of
an
idolatrous
religion
resembling
that
of
the
ancient
persians
who
worshipped
the
sun
moon
and
stars
in
mecca
in
the
year
mahomet
was
born
and
here
at
the
age
of
forty
he
proclaimed
himself
the
prophet
of
god
in
dignity
as
superior
to
christ
as
christ
had
been
to
moses
having
obtained
by
slow
degrees
a
considerable
number
of
disciples
he
resorted
to
arms
to
diffuse
his
religion
the
energy
and
zeal
of
his
followers
aided
by
the
weakness
of
the
neighboring
nations
enabled
him
and
his
successors
to
spread
the
sway
of
arabia
and
the
religion
of
mahomet
over
the
countries
to
the
east
as
far
as
the
indus
northward
over
persia
and
asia
minor
westward
over
egypt
and
the
southern
shores
of
the
mediterranean
and
thence
over
the
principal
portion
of
spain
all
this
was
done
within
one
hundred
years
from
the
hegira
or
flight
of
mahomet
from
mecca
to
medina
which
happened
in
the
year
and
is
the
era
from
which
mahometans
reckon
time
as
we
do
from
the
birth
of
christ
from
spain
the
way
was
open
for
the
saracens
so
the
followers
of
mahomet
were
called
into
france
the
conquest
of
which
if
achieved
would
have
been
followed
very
probably
by
that
of
all
the
rest
of
europe
and
would
have
resulted
in
the
banishment
of
christianity
from
the
earth
for
christianity
was
not
at
that
day
universally
professed
even
by
those
nations
which
we
now
regard
as
foremost
in
civilization
great
part
of
germany
britain
denmark
and
russia
were
still
pagan
or
barbarous
at
that
time
there
ruled
in
france
though
without
the
title
of
king
the
first
of
those
illustrious
charleses
of
whom
we
have
spoken
charles
martel
the
grandfather
of
charlemagne
the
saracens
of
spain
had
made
incursions
into
france
in
and
and
had
retired
carrying
with
them
a
vast
booty
in
anbessa
who
was
then
the
saracen
governor
of
spain
crossed
the
pyrenees
with
a
numerous
army
and
took
by
storm
the
strong
town
of
carcassone
so
great
was
the
terror
excited
by
this
invasion
that
the
country
for
a
wide
extent
submitted
to
the
conqueror
and
a
mahometan
governor
for
the
province
was
appointed
and
installed
at
narbonne
anbessa
however
received
a
fatal
wound
in
one
of
his
engagements
and
the
saracens
being
thus
checked
from
further
advance
retired
to
narbonne
in
the
saracens
again
invaded
france
under
abdalrahman
advanced
rapidly
to
the
banks
of
the
garonne
and
laid
siege
to
bordeaux
the
city
was
taken
by
assault
and
delivered
up
to
the
soldiery
the
invaders
still
pressed
forward
and
spread
over
the
territories
of
orleans
auxerre
and
sens
their
advanced
parties
were
suddenly
called
in
by
their
chief
who
had
received
information
of
the
rich
abbey
of
martin
of
tours
and
resolved
to
plunder
and
destroy
it
charles
during
all
this
time
had
done
nothing
to
oppose
the
saracens
for
the
reason
that
the
portion
of
france
over
which
their
incursions
had
been
made
was
not
at
that
time
under
his
dominion
but
constituted
an
independent
kingdom
under
the
name
of
aquitaine
of
which
eude
was
king
but
now
charles
became
convinced
of
the
danger
and
prepared
to
encounter
it
abdalrahman
was
advancing
toward
tours
when
intelligence
of
the
approach
of
charles
at
the
head
of
an
army
of
franks
compelled
him
to
fall
back
upon
poitiers
in
order
to
seize
an
advantageous
field
of
battle
charles
martel
had
called
together
his
warriors
from
every
part
of
his
dominions
and
at
the
head
of
such
an
army
as
had
hardly
ever
been
seen
in
france
crossed
the
loire
probably
at
orleans
and
being
joined
by
the
remains
of
the
army
of
aquitaine
came
in
sight
of
the
arabs
in
the
month
of
october
the
saracens
seem
to
have
been
aware
of
the
terrible
enemy
they
were
now
to
encounter
and
for
the
first
time
these
formidable
conquerors
hesitated
the
two
armies
remained
in
presence
during
seven
days
before
either
ventured
to
begin
the
attack
but
at
length
the
signal
for
battle
was
given
by
abdalrahman
and
the
immense
mass
of
the
saracen
army
rushed
with
fury
on
the
franks
but
the
heavy
line
of
the
northern
warriors
remained
like
a
rock
and
the
saracens
during
nearly
the
whole
day
expended
their
strength
in
vain
attempts
to
make
any
impression
upon
them
at
length
about
four
in
the
afternoon
when
abdalrahman
was
preparing
for
a
new
and
desperate
attempt
to
break
the
line
of
the
franks
a
terrible
clamor
was
heard
in
the
rear
of
the
saracens
it
was
king
eude
who
with
his
aquitanians
had
attacked
their
camp
and
a
great
part
of
the
saracen
army
rushed
tumultuously
from
the
field
to
protect
their
plunder
in
this
moment
of
confusion
the
line
of
the
franks
advanced
and
sweeping
the
field
before
it
carried
fearful
slaughter
amongst
the
enemy
abdalrahman
made
desperate
efforts
to
rally
his
troops
but
when
he
himself
with
the
bravest
of
his
officers
fell
beneath
the
swords
of
the
christians
all
order
disappeared
and
the
remains
of
his
army
sought
refuge
in
their
immense
camp
from
which
eude
and
his
aquitanians
had
been
repulsed
it
was
now
late
and
charles
unwilling
to
risk
an
attack
on
the
camp
in
the
dark
withdrew
his
army
and
passed
the
night
in
the
plain
expecting
to
renew
the
battle
in
the
morning
accordingly
when
daylight
came
the
franks
drew
up
in
order
of
battle
but
no
enemy
appeared
and
when
at
last
they
ventured
to
approach
the
saracen
camp
they
found
it
empty
the
invaders
had
taken
advantage
of
the
night
to
begin
their
retreat
and
were
already
on
their
way
back
to
spain
leaving
their
immense
plunder
behind
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
franks
this
was
the
celebrated
battle
of
tours
in
which
vast
numbers
of
the
saracens
were
slain
and
only
fifteen
hundred
of
the
franks
charles
received
the
surname
of
martel
the
hammer
in
consequence
of
this
victory
the
saracens
notwithstanding
this
severe
blow
continued
to
hold
their
ground
in
the
south
of
france
but
pepin
the
son
of
charles
martel
who
succeeded
to
his
father
power
and
assumed
the
title
of
king
successively
took
from
them
the
strong
places
they
held
and
in
by
the
capture
of
narbonne
their
capital
extinguished
the
remains
of
their
power
in
france
charlemagne
or
charles
the
great
succeeded
his
father
pepin
on
the
throne
in
the
year
this
prince
though
the
hero
of
numerous
romantic
legends
appears
greater
in
history
than
in
fiction
whether
we
regard
him
as
a
warrior
or
as
a
legislator
as
a
patron
of
learning
or
as
the
civilizer
of
a
barbarous
nation
he
is
entitled
to
our
warmest
admiration
such
he
is
in
history
but
the
romancers
represent
him
as
often
weak
and
passionate
the
victim
of
treacherous
counsellors
and
at
the
mercy
of
turbulent
barons
on
whose
prowess
he
depends
for
the
maintenance
of
his
throne
the
historical
representation
is
doubtless
the
true
one
for
it
is
handed
down
in
trustworthy
records
and
is
confirmed
by
the
events
of
the
age
at
the
height
of
his
power
the
french
empire
extended
over
what
we
now
call
france
germany
switzerland
holland
belgium
and
great
part
of
italy
in
the
year
charlemagne
being
in
rome
whither
he
had
gone
with
a
numerous
army
to
protect
the
pope
was
crowned
by
the
pontiff
emperor
of
the
west
on
christmas
day
charles
entered
the
church
of
peter
as
if
merely
to
take
his
part
in
the
celebration
of
the
mass
with
the
rest
of
the
congregation
when
he
approached
the
altar
and
stooped
in
the
act
of
prayer
the
pope
stepped
forward
and
placed
a
crown
of
gold
upon
his
head
and
immediately
the
roman
people
shouted
life
and
victory
to
charles
the
august
crowned
by
god
the
great
and
pacific
emperor
of
the
romans
the
pope
then
prostrated
himself
before
him
and
paid
him
reverence
according
to
the
custom
established
in
the
times
of
the
ancient
emperors
and
concluded
the
ceremony
by
anointing
him
with
consecrated
oil
charlemagne
wars
were
chiefly
against
the
pagan
and
barbarous
people
who
under
the
name
of
saxons
inhabited
the
countries
now
called
hanover
and
holland
he
also
led
expeditions
against
the
saracens
of
spain
but
his
wars
with
the
saracens
were
not
carried
on
as
the
romances
assert
in
france
but
on
the
soil
of
spain
he
entered
spain
by
the
eastern
pyrenees
and
made
an
easy
conquest
of
barcelona
and
pampeluna
but
saragossa
refused
to
open
her
gates
to
him
and
charles
ended
by
negotiating
and
accepting
a
vast
sum
of
gold
as
the
price
of
his
return
over
the
pyrenees
on
his
way
back
he
marched
with
his
whole
army
through
the
gorges
of
the
mountains
by
way
of
the
valleys
of
engui
eno
and
roncesvalles
the
chief
of
this
region
had
waited
upon
charlemagne
on
his
advance
as
a
faithful
vassal
of
the
monarchy
but
now
on
the
return
of
the
franks
he
had
called
together
all
the
wild
mountaineers
who
acknowledged
him
as
their
chief
and
they
occupied
the
heights
of
the
mountains
under
which
the
army
had
to
pass
the
main
body
of
the
troops
met
with
no
obstruction
and
received
no
intimation
of
danger
but
the
which
was
considerably
behind
and
encumbered
with
its
plunder
was
overwhelmed
by
the
mountaineers
in
the
pass
of
roncesvalles
and
slain
to
a
man
some
of
the
bravest
of
the
frankish
chiefs
perished
on
this
occasion
among
whom
is
mentioned
roland
or
orlando
governor
of
the
marches
or
frontier
of
brittany
his
name
became
famous
in
after
times
and
the
disaster
of
roncesvalles
and
death
of
roland
became
eventually
the
most
celebrated
episode
in
the
vast
cycle
of
romance
though
after
this
there
were
hostile
encounters
between
the
armies
of
charlemagne
and
the
saracens
they
were
of
small
account
and
generally
on
the
soil
of
spain
thus
the
historical
foundation
for
the
stories
of
the
romancers
is
but
scanty
unless
we
suppose
the
events
of
an
earlier
and
of
a
later
age
to
be
incorporated
with
those
of
charlemagne
own
time
there
is
however
a
pretended
history
which
for
a
long
time
was
admitted
as
authentic
and
attributed
to
turpin
archbishop
of
rheims
a
real
personage
of
the
time
of
charlemagne
its
title
is
history
of
charles
the
great
and
orlando
it
is
now
unhesitatingly
considered
as
a
collection
of
popular
traditions
produced
by
some
credulous
and
unscrupulous
monk
who
thought
to
give
dignity
to
his
romance
by
ascribing
its
authorship
to
a
and
eminent
individual
it
introduces
its
pretended
author
bishop
turpin
in
this
manner
turpin

of

adapted

the
acts
of

book
and

the
year
of
our
lord
eight
hundred
and
thirty
the
titles
of
some
of
archbishop
turpin
chapters
will
show
the
nature
of
his
history
they
are
these
of
the
walls
of
pampeluna
that
fell
of
themselves
of
the
war
of
the
holy
facundus
where
the
spears
grew

of
the
christians

their
spears
in
the
evening
erect
in
the
ground
before
the
castle
and
found
them
in
the
morning
covered
with
bark
and
branches
how
the
sun
stood
still
for
three
days
and
of
the
slaughter
of
four
thousand
saracens
turpin
history
has
perhaps
been
the
source
of
the
marvellous
adventures
which
succeeding
poets
and
romancers
have
accumulated
around
the
names
of
charlemagne
and
his
paladins
or
peers
but
ariosto
and
the
other
italian
poets
have
drawn
from
different
sources
and
doubtless
often
from
their
own
invention
numberless
other
stories
which
they
attribute
to
the
same
heroes
not
hesitating
to
quote
as
their
authority
the
good
turpin
though
his
history
contains
no
trace
of
them
and
the
more
outrageous
the
improbability
or
rather
the
impossibility
of
their
narrations
the
more
attentive
are
they
to
cite
the
archbishop
generally
adding
their
testimonial
to
his
unquestionable
veracity
the
principal
italian
poets
who
have
sung
the

the
characters

ogier
the

embraced

the
description
which
an
ancient
chronicler
gives
of
charlemagne
as
described
by
ogier
is
so
picturesque
that
we
are
tempted
to
transcribe
it
charlemagne
was
advancing
to
the

didier
king

appeared
his

with

iron
helmet
his
hands
with
iron

his

with
a
cuirass
of

by
a
people

hearts
were
harder
still
the
blaze
of
the
weapons
flashed
terror
into
the
streets
of
the
city
this
picture
of
charlemagne
in
his
military
aspect
would
be
incomplete
without
a
corresponding
one
of
his
mood
of
peace
one
of
the
greatest
of
modern
historians
guizot
has
compared
the
glory
of
charlemagne
to
a
brilliant
meteor
rising
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
of
barbarism
to
disappear
no
less
suddenly
in
the
darkness
of
feudalism
but
the
light
of
this
meteor
was
not
extinguished
and
reviving
civilization
owed
much
that
was
permanently
beneficial
to
the
great
emperor
of
the
franks
his
ruling
hand
is
seen
in
the
legislation
of
his
time
as
well
as
in
the
administration
of
the
laws
he
encouraged
learning
he
upheld
the
clergy
who
were
the
only
peaceful
and
intellectual
class
against
the
encroaching
and
turbulent
barons
he
was
an
affectionate
father
and
watched
carefully
over
the
education
of
his
children
both
sons
and
daughters
of
his
encouragement
of
learning
we
will
give
some
particulars
he
caused
learned
men
to
be
brought
from
italy
and
from
other
foreign
countries
to
revive
the
public
schools
of
france
which
had
been
prostrated
by
the
disorders
of
preceding
times
he
recompensed
these
learned
men
liberally
and
kept
some
of
them
near
himself
honoring
them
with
his
friendship
of
these
the
most
celebrated
is
alcuin
an
englishman
whose
writings
still
remain
and
prove
him
to
have
been
both
a
learned
and
a
wise
man
with
the
assistance
of
alcuin
and
others
like
him
he
founded
an
academy
or
royal
school
which
should
have
the
direction
of
the
studies
of
all
the
schools
of
the
kingdom
charlemagne
himself
was
a
member
of
this
academy
on
equal
terms
with
the
rest
he
attended
its
meetings
and
fulfilled
all
the
duties
of
an
academician
each
member
took
the
name
of
some
famous
man
of
antiquity
alcuin
called
himself
horace
another
took
the
name
of
augustin
a
third
of
pindar
charlemagne
who
knew
the
psalms
by
heart
and
who
had
an
ambition
to
be
according
to
his
conception
a
king
after
god
own
heart
received
from
his
brother
academicians
the
name
of
david
of
the
respect
entertained
for
him
by
foreign
nations
an
interesting
proof
is
afforded
in
the
embassy
sent
to
him
by
the
caliph
of
the
arabians
the
celebrated
haroun
al
raschid
a
prince
in
character
and
conduct
not
unlike
to
charlemagne
the
ambassadors
brought
with
them
besides
other
rich
presents
a
clock
the
first
that
was
seen
in
europe
which
excited
universal
admiration
it
had
the
form
of
a
edifice
with
twelve
doors
these
doors
formed
niches
in
each
of
which
was
a
little
statue
representing
one
of
the
hours
at
the
striking
of
the
hour
the
doors
one
for
each
stroke
was
seen
to
open
and
from
the
doors
to
issue
as
many
of
the
little
statues
which
following
one
another
marched
gravely
round
the
tower
the
motion
of
the
clock
was
caused
by
water
and
the
striking
was
effected
by
balls
of
brass
equal
to
the
number
of
the
hours
which
fell
upon
a
cymbal
of
the
same
metal
the
number
falling
being
determined
by
the
discharge
of
the
water
which
as
it
sunk
in
the
vessel
allowed
their
escape
charlemagne
was
succeeded
by
his
son
louis
a
but
feeble
prince
in
whose
reign
the
fabric
reared
by
charles
began
rapidly
to
crumble
louis
was
followed
successively
by
two
charleses
incapable
princes
whose
weak
and
often
tyrannical
conduct
is
no
doubt
the
source
of
incidents
of
that
character
ascribed
in
the
romances
to
charlemagne
the
lawless
and
disobedient
deportment
of
charles
paladins
instances
of
which
are
so
frequent
in
the
romantic
legends
was
also
a
trait
of
the
declining
empire
but
not
of
that
of
charlemagne
the
peers
or
paladins
the
twelve
most
illustrious
knights
of
charlemagne
were
called
peers
for
the
equality
that
reigned
among
them
while
the
name
of
paladins
also
conferred
on
them
implies
that
they
were
inmates
of
the
palace
and
companions
of
the
king
their
names
are
always
given
alike
by
the
romancers
yet
we
may
enumerate
the
most
distinguished
of
them
as
follows
orlando
or
roland
the
former
the
italian
the
latter
the
french
form
of
the
name
favorite
nephew
of
charlemagne
rinaldo
of
montalban
cousin
of
orlando
namo
duke
of
bavaria
salomon
king
of
brittany
turpin
the
archbishop
astolpho
of
england
ogier
the
dane
malagigi
the
enchanter
and
florismart
the
friend
of
orlando
there
were
others
who
are
sometimes
named
as
paladins
and
the
number
can
not
be
strictly
limited
to
twelve
charlemagne
himself
must
be
counted
one
and
ganelon
or
gano
of
mayence
the
treacherous
enemy
of
all
the
rest
was
rated
high
on
the
list
by
his
deluded
sovereign
who
was
completely
the
victim
of
his
arts
we
shall
introduce
more
particularly
to
our
readers
a
few
of
the
principal
peers
leaving
the
others
to
make
their
own
introduction
as
they
appear
in
the
course
of
our
narrative
we
begin
with
orlando
orlando
milon
or
milone
a
knight
of
great
family
and
distantly
related
to
charlemagne
having
secretly
married
bertha
the
emperor
sister
was
banished
from
france
and
excommunicated
by
the
pope
after
a
long
and
miserable
wandering
on
foot
as
mendicants
milon
and
his
wife
arrived
at
sutri
in
italy
where
they
took
refuge
in
a
cave
and
in
that
cave
orlando
was
born
there
his
mother
continued
deriving
a
scanty
support
from
the
compassion
of
the
neighboring
peasants
while
milon
in
quest
of
honor
and
fortune
went
into
foreign
lands
orlando
grew
up
among
the
children
of
the
peasantry
surpassing
them
all
in
strength
and
manly
graces
among
his
companions
in
age
though
in
station
far
more
elevated
was
oliver
son
of
the
governor
of
the
town
between
the
two
boys
a
feud
arose
that
led
to
a
fight
in
which
orlando
thrashed
his
rival
but
this
did
not
prevent
a
friendship
springing
up
between
the
two
which
lasted
through
life
orlando
was
so
poor
that
he
was
sometimes
half
naked
as
he
was
a
favorite
of
the
boys
one
day
four
of
them
brought
some
cloth
to
make
him
clothes
two
brought
white
and
two
red
and
from
this
circumstance
orlando
took
his
or
quarterings
when
charlemagne
was
on
his
way
to
rome
to
receive
the
imperial
crown
he
dined
in
public
in
sutri
orlando
and
his
mother
that
day
had
nothing
to
eat
and
orlando
coming
suddenly
upon
the
royal
party
and
seeing
abundance
of
provisions
seized
from
the
attendants
as
much
as
he
could
carry
off
and
made
good
his
retreat
in
spite
of
their
resistance
the
emperor
being
told
of
this
incident
was
reminded
of
an
intimation
he
had
received
in
a
dream
and
ordered
the
boy
to
be
followed
this
was
done
by
three
of
the
knights
whom
orlando
would
have
encountered
with
a
cudgel
on
their
entering
the
grotto
had
not
his
mother
restrained
him
when
they
heard
from
her
who
she
was
they
threw
themselves
at
her
feet
and
promised
to
obtain
her
pardon
from
the
emperor
this
was
easily
effected
orlando
was
received
into
favor
by
the
emperor
returned
with
him
to
france
and
so
distinguished
himself
that
he
became
the
most
powerful
support
of
the
throne
and
of
christianity
footnote
it
is
plain
that
shakspeare
borrowed
from
this
source
the
similar
incident
in
his
as
you
like
it
the
names
of
characters
in
the
play
orlando
oliver
rowland
indicate
the
same
thing
roland
and
ferragus
orlando
or
roland
particularly
distinguished
himself
by
his
combat
with
ferragus
ferragus
was
a
giant
and
moreover
his
skin
was
of
such
impenetrable
stuff
that
no
sword
could
make
any
impression
upon
it
the
giant
mode
of
fighting
was
to
seize
his
adversary
in
his
arms
and
carry
him
off
in
spite
of
all
the
struggles
he
could
make
utmost
skill
only
availed
to
keep
him
out
of
the
giant
clutches
but
all
his
efforts
to
wound
him
with
the
sword
were
useless
after
long
fighting
ferragus
was
so
weary
that
he
proposed
a
truce
and
when
it
was
agreed
upon
he
lay
down
and
immediately
fell
asleep
he
slept
in
perfect
security
for
it
was
against
all
the
laws
of
chivalry
to
take
advantage
of
an
adversary
under
such
circumstances
but
ferragus
lay
so
uncomfortably
for
the
want
of
a
pillow
that
orlando
took
pity
upon
him
and
brought
a
smooth
stone
and
placed
it
under
his
head
when
the
giant
woke
up
after
a
refreshing
nap
and
perceived
what
orlando
had
done
he
seemed
quite
grateful
became
sociable
and
talked
freely
in
the
usual
boastful
style
of
such
characters
among
other
things
he
told
orlando
that
he
need
not
attempt
to
kill
him
with
a
sword
for
that
every
part
of
his
body
was
invulnerable
except
this
and
as
he
spoke
he
put
his
hand
to
the
vital
part
just
in
the
middle
of
his
breast
aided
by
this
information
orlando
succeeded
when
the
fight
was
renewed
in
piercing
the
giant
in
the
very
spot
he
had
pointed
out
and
giving
him
a
great
was
the
rejoicing
in
the
christian
camp
and
many
the
praises
showered
upon
the
victorious
paladin
by
the
emperor
and
all
his
host
on
another
occasion
orlando
encountered
a
puissant
saracen
warrior
and
took
from
him
as
the
prize
of
victory
the
sword
durindana
this
famous
weapon
had
once
belonged
to
the
illustrious
prince
hector
of
troy
it
was
of
the
finest
workmanship
and
of
such
strength
and
temper
that
no
armor
in
the
world
could
stand
against
it
a
roland
for
an
oliver
guerin
de
montglave
held
the
lordship
of
vienne
subject
to
charlemagne
he
had
quarrelled
with
his
sovereign
and
charles
laid
siege
to
his
city
having
ravaged
the
neighboring
country
guerin
was
an
aged
warrior
but
relied
for
his
defence
upon
his
four
sons
and
two
grandsons
who
were
among
the
bravest
knights
of
the
age
after
the
siege
had
continued
two
months
charlemagne
received
tidings
that
marsilius
king
of
spain
had
invaded
france
and
finding
himself
unopposed
was
advancing
rapidly
in
the
southern
provinces
at
this
intelligence
charles
listened
to
the
counsel
of
his
peers
and
consented
to
put
the
quarrel
with
guerin
to
the
decision
of
heaven
by
single
combat
between
two
knights
one
of
each
party
selected
by
lot
the
proposal
was
acceptable
to
guerin
and
his
sons
the
names
of
the
four
together
with
guerin
own
who
would
not
be
excused
and
of
the
two
grandsons
who
claimed
their
lot
being
put
into
a
helmet
was
drawn
forth
and
to
him
the
youngest
of
the
grandsons
was
assigned
the
honor
and
the
peril
of
the
combat
he
accepted
the
award
with
delight
exulting
in
being
thought
worthy
to
maintain
the
cause
of
his
family
on
charlemagne
side
roland
was
the
designated
champion
and
neither
he
nor
oliver
knew
who
his
antagonist
was
to
be
they
met
on
an
island
in
the
rhone
and
the
warriors
of
both
camps
were
ranged
on
either
shore
spectators
of
the
battle
at
the
first
encounter
both
lances
were
shivered
but
both
riders
kept
their
seats
immovable
they
dismounted
and
drew
their
swords
then
ensued
a
combat
which
seemed
so
equal
that
the
spectators
could
not
form
an
opinion
as
to
the
probable
issue
two
hours
and
more
the
knights
continued
to
strike
and
parry
to
thrust
and
ward
neither
showing
any
sign
of
weariness
nor
ever
being
taken
at
unawares
at
length
orlando
struck
furiously
upon
oliver
shield
burying
durindana
in
its
edge
so
deeply
that
he
could
not
draw
it
back
and
oliver
almost
at
the
same
moment
thrust
so
vigorously
upon
orlando
breastplate
that
his
sword
snapped
off
at
the
handle
thus
were
the
two
warriors
left
weaponless
scarcely
pausing
a
moment
they
rushed
upon
one
another
each
striving
to
throw
his
adversary
to
the
ground
and
failing
in
that
each
snatched
at
the
other
helmet
to
tear
it
away
both
succeeded
and
at
the
same
moment
they
stood
face
to
face
and
roland
recognized
oliver
and
oliver
roland
for
a
moment
they
stood
still
and
the
next
with
open
arms
rushed
into
one
another
embrace
i
am
conquered
said
orlando
i
yield
me
said
oliver
the
people
on
the
shore
knew
not
what
to
make
of
all
this
presently
they
saw
the
two
late
antagonists
standing
hand
in
hand
and
it
was
evident
the
battle
was
at
an
end
the
knights
crowded
round
them
and
with
one
voice
hailed
them
as
equals
in
glory
if
there
were
any
who
felt
disposed
to
murmur
that
the
battle
was
left
undecided
they
were
silenced
by
the
voice
of
ogier
the
dane
who
proclaimed
aloud
that
all
had
been
done
that
honor
required
and
declared
that
he
would
maintain
that
award
against
all
gainsayers
the
quarrel
with
guerin
and
his
sons
being
left
undecided
a
truce
was
made
for
four
days
and
in
that
time
by
the
efforts
of
duke
namo
on
the
one
side
and
of
oliver
on
the
other
a
reconciliation
was
effected
charlemagne
accompanied
by
guerin
and
his
valiant
family
marched
to
meet
marsilius
who
hastened
to
retreat
across
the
frontier
rinaldo
rinaldo
was
one
of
the
four
sons
of
aymon
who
married
aya
the
sister
of
charlemagne
thus
rinaldo
was
nephew
to
charlemagne
and
cousin
of
orlando
when
rinaldo
had
grown
old
enough
to
assume
arms
orlando
had
won
for
himself
an
illustrious
name
by
his
exploits
against
the
saracens
whom
charlemagne
and
his
brave
knights
had
driven
out
of
france
fame
excited
a
noble
emulation
in
rinaldo
eager
to
go
in
pursuit
of
glory
he
wandered
in
the
country
near
paris
and
one
day
saw
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
a
superb
horse
fully
equipped
and
loaded
with
a
complete
suit
of
armor
rinaldo
clothed
himself
in
the
armor
and
mounted
the
horse
but
took
not
the
sword
on
the
day
when
with
his
brothers
he
had
received
the
honor
of
knighthood
from
the
emperor
he
had
sworn
never
to
bind
a
sword
to
his
side
till
he
had
wrested
one
from
some
famous
knight
rinaldo
took
his
way
to
the
forest
of
arden
celebrated
for
so
many
adventures
hardly
had
he
entered
it
when
he
met
an
old
man
bending
under
the
weight
of
years
and
learned
from
him
that
the
forest
was
infested
with
a
wild
horse
untamable
that
broke
and
overturned
everything
that
opposed
his
career
to
attack
him
he
said
or
even
to
meet
him
was
certain
death
rinaldo
far
from
being
alarmed
showed
the
most
eager
desire
to
combat
the
animal
this
was
the
horse
bayard
afterward
so
famous
he
had
formerly
belonged
to
amadis
of
gaul
after
the
death
of
that
hero
he
had
been
held
under
enchantment
by
the
power
of
a
magician
who
predicted
that
when
the
time
came
to
break
the
spell
he
should
be
subdued
by
a
knight
of
the
lineage
of
amadis
and
not
less
brave
than
he
to
win
this
wonderful
horse
it
was
necessary
to
conquer
him
by
force
or
skill
for
from
the
moment
when
he
should
be
thrown
down
he
would
become
docile
and
manageable
his
habitual
resort
was
a
cave
on
the
borders
of
the
forest
but
woe
be
to
any
one
who
should
approach
him
unless
gifted
with
strength
and
courage
more
than
mortal
having
told
this
the
old
man
departed
he
was
not
in
fact
an
old
man
but
malagigi
the
enchanter
cousin
of
rinaldo
who
to
favor
the
enterprises
of
the
young
knight
had
procured
for
him
the
horse
and
armor
which
he
so
opportunely
found
and
now
put
him
in
the
way
to
acquire
a
horse
unequalled
in
the
world
rinaldo
plunged
into
the
forest
and
spent
many
days
in
seeking
bayard
but
found
no
traces
of
him
one
day
he
encountered
a
saracen
knight
with
whom
he
made
acquaintance
as
often
happened
to
knights
by
first
meeting
him
in
combat
this
knight
whose
name
was
isolier
was
also
in
quest
of
bayard
rinaldo
succeeded
in
the
encounter
and
so
severe
was
the
shock
that
isolier
was
a
long
time
insensible
when
he
revived
and
was
about
to
resume
the
contest
a
peasant
who
passed
by
it
was
malagigi
interrupted
them
with
the
news
that
the
terrible
horse
was
near
at
hand
advising
them
to
unite
their
powers
to
subdue
him
for
it
would
require
all
their
ability
rinaldo
and
isolier
now
become
friends
proceeded
together
to
the
attack
of
the
horse
they
found
bayard
and
stood
a
long
time
concealed
by
the
wood
admiring
his
strength
and
beauty
a
bright
bay
in
color
whence
he
was
called
bayard
with
a
silver
star
in
his
forehead
and
his
hind
feet
white
his
body
slender
his
head
delicate
his
ample
chest
filled
out
with
swelling
muscles
his
shoulders
broad
and
full
his
legs
straight
and
sinewy
his
thick
mane
falling
over
his
arching
neck
he
came
rushing
through
the
forest
regardless
of
rocks
bushes
or
trees
rending
everything
that
opposed
his
way
and
neighing
defiance
he
first
descried
isolier
and
rushed
upon
him
the
knight
received
him
with
lance
in
rest
but
the
fierce
animal
broke
the
spear
and
his
course
was
not
delayed
by
it
for
an
instant
the
spaniard
adroitly
stepped
aside
and
gave
way
to
the
rushing
tempest
bayard
checked
his
career
and
turned
again
upon
the
knight
who
had
already
drawn
his
sword
he
drew
his
sword
for
he
had
no
hope
of
taming
the
horse
that
he
was
satisfied
was
impossible
bayard
rushed
upon
him
fiercely
rearing
now
on
this
side
now
on
that
the
knight
struck
him
with
his
sword
where
the
white
star
adorned
his
forehead
but
struck
in
vain
and
felt
ashamed
thinking
that
he
had
struck
feebly
for
he
did
not
know
that
the
skin
of
that
horse
was
so
tough
that
the
keenest
sword
could
make
no
impression
upon
it
whistling
fell
the
sword
once
more
and
struck
with
greater
force
and
the
fierce
horse
felt
it
and
drooped
his
head
under
the
blow
but
the
next
moment
turned
upon
his
foe
with
such
a
buffet
that
the
pagan
fell
stunned
and
lifeless
to
the
earth
rinaldo
who
saw
isolier
fall
and
thought
that
his
life
was
reft
darted
towards
the
horse
and
with
his
fist
gave
him
such
a
blow
on
the
jaws
that
the
blood
tinged
his
mouth
with
vermilion
quicker
than
an
arrow
leaves
the
bow
the
horse
turned
upon
him
and
tried
to
seize
his
arm
with
his
teeth
the
knight
stepped
back
and
then
repeating
his
blow
struck
him
on
the
forehead
bayard
turned
and
kicked
with
both
his
feet
with
a
force
that
would
have
shattered
a
mountain
rinaldo
was
on
his
guard
and
evaded
his
attacks
whether
made
with
head
or
heels
he
kept
at
his
side
avoiding
both
but
making
a
false
step
he
at
last
received
a
terrible
blow
from
the
horse
foot
and
at
the
shock
almost
fainted
away
a
second
such
blow
would
have
killed
him
but
the
horse
kicked
at
random
and
a
second
blow
did
not
reach
rinaldo
who
in
a
moment
recovered
himself
thus
the
contest
continued
until
by
chance
foot
got
caught
between
the
branches
of
an
oak
rinaldo
seized
it
and
putting
forth
all
his
strength
and
address
threw
him
on
the
ground
no
sooner
had
bayard
touched
the
ground
than
all
his
rage
subsided
no
longer
an
object
of
terror
he
became
gentle
and
quiet
yet
with
dignity
in
his
mildness
the
paladin
patted
his
neck
stroked
his
breast
and
smoothed
his
mane
while
the
animal
neighed
and
showed
delight
to
be
caressed
by
his
master
rinaldo
seeing
him
now
completely
subdued
took
the
saddle
and
trappings
from
the
other
horse
and
adorned
bayard
with
the
spoils
rinaldo
became
one
of
the
most
illustrious
knights
of
court
indeed
the
most
illustrious
if
we
except
orlando
yet
he
was
not
always
so
obedient
to
the
emperor
commands
as
he
should
have
been
and
every
fault
he
committed
was
sure
to
be
aggravated
by
the
malice
of
gan
duke
of
maganza
the
treacherous
enemy
of
rinaldo
and
all
his
house
at
one
time
rinaldo
had
incurred
the
severe
displeasure
of
charlemagne
and
been
banished
from
court
seeing
no
chance
of
being
ever
restored
to
favor
he
went
to
spain
and
entered
into
the
service
of
the
saracen
king
ivo
his
brothers
alardo
ricardo
and
ricciardetto
accompanied
him
and
all
four
served
the
king
so
faithfully
that
they
rose
to
high
favor
with
him
the
king
gave
them
land
in
the
mountains
on
the
frontiers
of
france
and
spain
and
subjected
all
the
country
round
to
rinaldo
authority
there
was
plenty
of
marble
in
the
mountains
the
king
furnished
workmen
and
they
built
a
castle
for
rinaldo
surrounded
with
high
walls
so
as
to
be
almost
impregnable
built
of
white
stone
and
placed
on
the
brow
of
a
marble
promontory
the
castle
shone
like
a
star
and
rinaldo
gave
it
the
name
of
montalban
here
he
assembled
his
friends
many
of
whom
were
banished
men
like
himself
and
the
country
people
furnished
them
with
provisions
in
return
for
the
protection
the
castle
afforded
yet
some
of
rinaldo
men
were
lawless
and
sometimes
the
supplies
were
not
furnished
in
sufficient
abundance
so
that
rinaldo
and
his
garrison
got
a
bad
name
for
taking
by
force
what
they
could
not
obtain
by
gift
and
we
sometimes
find
montalban
spoken
of
as
a
nest
of
freebooters
and
its
defenders
called
a
beggarly
garrison
charlemagne
displeasure
did
not
last
long
and
at
the
time
our
history
commences
rinaldo
and
his
brothers
were
completely
restored
to
the
favor
of
the
emperor
and
none
of
his
cavaliers
served
him
with
greater
zeal
and
fidelity
than
they
throughout
all
his
wars
with
the
saracens
and
pagans
the
tournament
it
was
the
month
of
may
and
the
feast
of
pentecost
charlemagne
had
ordered
magnificent
festivities
and
summoned
to
them
besides
his
paladins
and
vassals
of
the
crown
all
strangers
christian
or
saracen
then
sojourning
at
paris
among
the
guests
were
king
grandonio
from
spain
and
ferrau
the
saracen
with
eyes
like
an
eagle
orlando
and
rinaldo
the
emperor
nephews
duke
namo
astolpho
of
england
the
handsomest
man
living
malagigi
the
enchanter
and
gano
of
maganza
that
wily
traitor
who
had
the
art
to
make
the
emperor
think
he
loved
him
while
he
plotted
against
him
high
sat
charlemagne
at
the
head
of
his
vassals
and
his
paladins
rejoicing
in
the
thought
of
their
number
and
their
might
while
all
were
sitting
and
hearing
music
and
feasting
when
suddenly
there
came
into
the
hall
four
enormous
giants
having
between
them
a
lady
of
incomparable
beauty
attended
by
a
single
knight
there
were
many
ladies
present
who
had
seemed
beautiful
till
she
made
her
appearance
but
after
that
they
all
seemed
nothing
every
christian
knight
turned
his
eyes
to
her
and
every
pagan
crowded
round
her
while
she
with
a
sweetness
that
might
have
touched
a
heart
of
stone
thus
addressed
the
emperor
lord
the
renown
of
your
worthiness
and
of
the
valor
of
these
your
knights
which
echoes
from
sea
to
sea
encourages
me
to
hope
that
two
pilgrims
who
have
come
from
the
ends
of
the
world
to
behold
you
will
not
have
encountered
their
fatigue
in
vain
and
before
i
show
the
motive
which
has
brought
us
hither
learn
that
this
knight
is
my
brother
uberto
and
that
i
am
his
sister
angelica
fame
has
told
us
of
the
jousting
this
day
appointed
and
so
the
prince
my
brother
has
come
to
prove
his
valor
and
to
say
that
if
any
of
the
knights
here
assembled
choose
to
meet
him
in
the
joust
he
will
encounter
them
one
by
one
at
the
stair
of
merlin
by
the
fountain
of
the
pine
and
his
conditions
are
these
no
knight
who
chances
to
be
thrown
shall
be
allowed
to
renew
the
combat
but
shall
remain
prisoner
to
my
brother
but
if
my
brother
be
overthrown
he
shall
depart
out
of
the
country
leaving
me
as
the
prize
of
the
conqueror
now
it
must
be
stated
that
this
angelica
and
her
brother
who
called
himself
uberto
but
whose
real
name
was
argalia
were
the
children
of
galafron
king
of
cathay
who
had
sent
them
to
be
the
destruction
of
the
christian
host
for
argalia
was
armed
with
an
enchanted
lance
which
unfailingly
overthrew
everything
it
touched
and
he
was
mounted
on
a
horse
a
creature
of
magic
whose
swiftness
outstripped
the
wind
angelica
possessed
also
a
ring
which
was
a
defence
against
all
enchantments
and
when
put
into
the
mouth
rendered
the
bearer
invisible
thus
argalia
was
expected
to
subdue
and
take
prisoners
whatever
knights
should
dare
to
encounter
him
and
the
charms
of
angelica
were
relied
on
to
entice
the
paladins
to
make
the
fatal
venture
while
her
ring
would
afford
her
easy
means
of
escape
when
angelica
ceased
sneaking
she
knelt
before
the
king
and
awaited
his
answer
and
everybody
gazed
on
her
with
admiration
orlando
especially
felt
irresistibly
drawn
towards
her
so
that
he
trembled
and
changed
countenance
every
knight
in
the
hall
was
infected
with
the
same
feeling
not
excepting
old
duke
namo
and
charlemagne
himself
all
stood
for
a
while
in
silence
lost
in
the
delight
of
looking
at
her
the
fiery
youth
ferrau
could
hardly
restrain
himself
from
seizing
her
from
the
giants
and
carrying
her
away
rinaldo
turned
as
red
as
fire
while
malagigi
who
had
discovered
by
his
art
that
the
stranger
was
not
speaking
truth
muttered
softly
as
he
looked
at
her
exquisite
false
creature
i
will
play
thee
such
a
trick
for
this
as
will
leave
thee
no
cause
to
boast
of
thy
visit
charlemagne
to
detain
her
as
long
as
possible
before
him
delayed
his
assent
till
he
had
asked
her
a
number
of
questions
all
which
she
answered
discreetly
and
then
the
challenge
was
accepted
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
malagigi
consulted
his
book
and
found
out
the
whole
plot
of
the
vile
infidel
king
galafron
as
we
have
explained
it
so
he
determined
to
seek
the
damsel
and
frustrate
her
designs
he
hastened
to
the
appointed
spot
and
there
found
the
prince
and
his
sister
in
a
beautiful
pavilion
where
they
lay
asleep
while
the
four
giants
kept
watch
malagigi
took
his
book
and
cast
a
spell
out
of
it
and
immediately
the
four
giants
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
drawing
his
sword
for
he
was
a
belted
knight
he
softly
approached
the
young
lady
intending
to
despatch
her
at
once
but
seeing
her
look
so
lovely
he
paused
for
a
moment
thinking
there
was
no
need
of
hurry
as
he
believed
his
spell
was
upon
her
and
she
could
not
wake
but
the
ring
which
she
wore
secured
her
from
the
effect
of
the
spell
and
some
slight
noise
or
whatever
else
it
was
caused
her
at
that
moment
to
awake
she
uttered
a
great
cry
and
flew
to
her
brother
and
waked
him
by
the
help
of
her
knowledge
of
enchantment
they
took
and
bound
fast
the
magician
and
seizing
his
book
turned
his
arts
against
himself
then
they
summoned
a
crowd
of
demons
and
bade
them
seize
their
prisoner
and
bear
him
to
king
galafron
at
his
great
city
of
albracca
which
they
did
and
on
his
arrival
he
was
locked
up
in
a
rock
under
the
sea
while
these
things
were
going
on
all
was
uproar
at
paris
since
orlando
insisted
upon
being
the
first
to
try
the
adventure
at
the
stair
of
merlin
this
was
resented
by
the
other
pretenders
to
angelica
and
all
contested
his
right
to
the
precedence
the
tumult
was
stilled
by
the
usual
expedient
of
drawing
lots
and
the
first
prize
was
drawn
by
astolpho
ferrau
the
saracen
had
the
second
and
grandonio
the
third
next
came
berlinghieri
and
otho
then
charles
himself
and
as
his
would
have
it
after
thirty
more
the
indignant
orlando
astolpho
who
drew
the
first
lot
was
handsome
brave
and
rich
but
whether
from
heedlessness
or
want
of
skill
he
was
an
unlucky
jouster
and
very
apt
to
be
thrown
an
accident
which
he
bore
with
perfect
always
ready
to
mount
again
and
try
to
mend
his
fortune
generally
with
no
better
success
astolpho
went
forth
upon
his
adventure
with
great
gayety
of
dress
and
manner
encountered
argalia
and
was
immediately
tilted
out
of
the
saddle
he
railed
at
fortune
to
whom
he
laid
all
the
fault
but
his
painful
feelings
were
somewhat
relieved
by
the
kindness
of
angelica
who
touched
by
his
youth
and
good
looks
granted
him
the
liberty
of
the
pavilion
and
caused
him
to
be
treated
with
all
kindness
and
respect
the
violent
ferrau
had
the
next
chance
in
the
encounter
and
was
thrown
no
less
speedily
than
astolpho
but
he
did
not
so
easily
put
up
with
his
mischance
crying
out
what
are
the
emperor
engagements
to
me
he
rushed
with
his
sword
against
argalia
who
being
forced
to
defend
himself
dismounted
and
drew
his
sword
but
got
so
much
the
worse
of
the
fight
that
he
made
a
signal
of
surrender
and
after
some
words
listened
to
a
proposal
of
marriage
from
ferrau
to
his
sister
the
beauty
however
feeling
no
inclination
to
match
with
such
a
rough
and
person
was
so
dismayed
at
the
offer
that
hastily
bidding
her
brother
to
meet
her
in
the
forest
of
arden
she
vanished
from
the
sight
of
both
by
means
of
the
enchanted
ring
argalia
seeing
this
took
to
his
horse
of
swiftness
and
dashed
away
in
the
same
direction
ferrau
pursued
him
and
astolpho
thus
left
to
himself
took
possession
of
the
enchanted
lance
in
place
of
his
own
which
was
broken
not
knowing
the
treasure
he
possessed
in
it
and
returned
to
the
tournament
charlemagne
finding
the
lady
and
her
brother
gone
ordered
the
jousting
to
proceed
as
at
first
intended
in
which
astolpho
by
aid
of
the
enchanted
lance
unhorsed
all
comers
against
him
equally
to
their
astonishment
and
his
own
the
paladin
rinaldo
on
learning
the
issue
of
the
combat
of
ferrau
and
the
stranger
galloped
after
the
fair
fugitive
in
an
agony
of
love
and
impatience
orlando
perceiving
his
disappearance
pushed
forth
in
like
manner
and
at
length
all
three
are
in
the
forest
of
arden
hunting
about
for
her
who
is
invisible
now
in
this
forest
there
were
two
fountains
the
one
constructed
by
the
sage
merlin
who
designed
it
for
tristram
and
the
fair
isoude
footnote
see
their
story
in
king
arthur
and
his
knights
for
such
was
the
virtue
of
this
fountain
that
a
draught
of
its
waters
produced
on
oblivion
of
the
love
which
the
drinker
might
feel
and
even
produced
aversion
for
the
object
formerly
beloved
the
other
fountain
was
endowed
with
exactly
opposite
qualities
and
a
draught
of
it
inspired
love
for
the
first
living
object
that
was
seen
after
tasting
it
rinaldo
happened
to
come
to
the
first
mentioned
fountain
and
being
flushed
with
heat
dismounted
and
quenched
in
one
draught
both
his
thirst
and
his
passion
so
far
from
loving
angelica
as
before
he
hated
her
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
became
disgusted
with
the
search
he
was
upon
and
feeling
fatigued
with
his
ride
finding
a
sheltered
and
flowery
nook
laid
himself
down
and
fell
asleep
shortly
after
came
angelica
but
approaching
in
a
different
direction
she
espied
the
other
fountain
and
there
quenched
her
thirst
then
resuming
her
way
she
came
upon
the
sleeping
rinaldo
love
instantly
seized
her
and
she
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
the
meadow
round
was
all
full
of
lilies
of
the
valley
and
wild
roses
angelica
not
knowing
what
to
do
at
length
plucked
a
handful
of
these
and
dropped
them
one
by
one
on
the
face
of
the
sleeper
he
woke
up
and
seeing
who
it
was
received
her
salutations
with
averted
countenance
remounted
his
horse
and
galloped
away
in
vain
the
beautiful
creature
followed
and
called
after
him
in
vain
asked
him
what
she
had
done
to
be
so
despised
rinaldo
disappeared
leaving
her
in
despair
and
she
returned
in
tears
to
the
spot
where
she
had
found
him
sleeping
there
in
her
turn
she
herself
lay
down
pressing
the
spot
of
earth
on
which
he
had
lain
and
out
of
fatigue
and
sorrow
fell
asleep
as
angelica
thus
lay
fortune
conducted
orlando
to
the
same
place
the
attitude
in
which
she
was
sleeping
was
so
lovely
that
it
is
not
to
be
conceived
much
less
expressed
orlando
stood
gazing
like
a
man
who
had
been
transported
to
another
sphere
am
i
on
earth
he
exclaimed
or
am
i
in
paradise
surely
it
is
i
that
sleep
and
this
is
my
dream
but
his
dream
was
proved
to
be
none
in
a
manner
which
he
little
desired
ferrau
who
had
slain
argalia
came
up
raging
with
jealousy
and
a
combat
ensued
which
awoke
the
sleeper
terrified
at
what
she
beheld
she
rushed
to
her
palfrey
and
while
the
fighters
were
occupied
with
one
another
fled
away
through
the
forest
the
champions
continued
their
fight
till
they
were
interrupted
by
a
messenger
who
brought
word
to
ferrau
that
king
marsilius
his
sovereign
was
in
pressing
need
of
his
assistance
and
conjured
him
to
return
to
spain
ferrau
upon
this
proposed
to
suspend
the
combat
to
which
orlando
eager
to
pursue
angelica
agreed
ferrau
on
the
other
hand
departed
with
the
messenger
to
spain
orlando
quest
for
the
fair
fugitive
was
all
in
vain
aided
by
the
powers
of
magic
she
made
a
speedy
return
to
her
own
country
but
the
thought
of
rinaldo
could
not
be
banished
from
her
mind
and
she
determined
to
set
malagigi
at
liberty
and
to
employ
him
to
win
rinaldo
if
possible
to
make
her
a
return
of
affection
she
accordingly
freed
him
from
his
dungeon
unlocking
his
fetters
with
her
own
hands
and
restored
him
his
book
promising
him
ample
honors
and
rewards
on
condition
of
his
bringing
rinaldo
to
her
feet
malagigi
accordingly
with
the
aid
of
his
book
called
up
a
demon
mounted
him
and
departed
arrived
at
his
destination
he
inveigled
rinaldo
into
an
enchanted
bark
which
conveyed
him
without
any
visible
pilot
to
an
island
where
stood
an
edifice
called
joyous
castle
the
whole
island
was
a
garden
on
the
western
side
close
to
the
sea
was
the
palace
built
of
marble
so
clear
and
polished
that
it
reflected
the
landscape
about
it
rinaldo
leapt
ashore
and
soon
met
a
lady
who
invited
him
to
enter
the
house
was
as
beautiful
within
as
without
full
of
rooms
adorned
with
azure
and
gold
and
with
noble
paintings
the
lady
led
the
knight
into
an
apartment
painted
with
stories
and
opening
to
the
garden
through
pillars
of
crystal
with
golden
capitals
here
he
found
a
bevy
of
ladies
three
of
whom
were
singing
in
concert
while
another
played
on
an
instrument
of
exquisite
accord
and
the
rest
danced
round
about
them
when
the
ladies
beheld
him
coming
they
turned
the
dance
into
a
circuit
round
him
and
then
one
of
them
in
the
sweetest
manner
said
sir
knight
the
tables
are
set
and
the
hour
for
the
banquet
is
come
and
with
these
words
still
dancing
they
drew
him
across
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
apartment
to
a
table
that
was
spread
with
cloth
of
gold
and
fine
linen
under
a
bower
of
damask
roses
by
the
side
of
a
fountain
four
ladies
were
already
seated
there
who
rose
and
placed
rinaldo
at
their
head
in
a
chair
set
with
pearls
and
truly
indeed
was
he
astonished
a
repast
ensued
consisting
of
viands
the
most
delicate
and
wines
as
fragrant
as
they
were
fine
drunk
out
of
jewelled
cups
and
when
it
drew
towards
its
conclusion
harps
and
lutes
were
heard
in
the
distance
and
one
of
the
ladies
said
in
the
knight
ear
this
house
and
all
that
you
see
in
it
are
yours
for
you
alone
was
it
built
and
the
builder
is
a
queen
happy
indeed
must
you
think
yourself
for
she
loves
you
and
she
is
the
greatest
beauty
in
the
world
her
name
is
angelica
the
moment
rinaldo
heard
the
name
he
so
detested
he
started
up
with
a
changed
countenance
and
in
spite
of
all
that
the
lady
could
say
broke
off
across
the
garden
and
never
ceased
hastening
till
he
reached
the
place
where
he
landed
the
bark
was
still
on
the
shore
he
sprang
into
it
and
pushed
off
though
he
saw
nobody
in
it
but
himself
it
was
in
vain
for
him
to
try
to
control
its
movements
for
it
dashed
on
as
if
in
fury
till
it
reached
a
distant
shore
covered
with
a
gloomy
forest
here
rinaldo
surrounded
by
enchantments
of
a
very
different
sort
from
those
which
he
had
lately
resisted
was
entrapped
into
a
pit
the
pit
belonged
to
a
castle
called
altaripa
which
was
hung
with
human
heads
and
painted
red
with
blood
as
the
paladin
was
viewing
the
scene
with
amazement
a
hideous
old
woman
made
her
appearance
at
the
edge
of
the
pit
and
told
him
that
he
was
destined
to
be
thrown
to
a
monster
who
was
only
kept
from
devastating
the
whole
country
by
being
supplied
with
living
human
flesh
rinaldo
said
be
it
so
let
me
but
remain
armed
as
i
am
and
i
fear
nothing
the
old
woman
laughed
in
derision
rinaldo
remained
in
the
pit
all
night
and
the
next
morning
was
taken
to
the
place
where
the
monster
had
his
den
it
was
a
court
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
rinaldo
was
shut
in
with
the
beast
and
a
terrible
combat
ensued
rinaldo
was
unable
to
make
any
impression
on
the
scales
of
the
monster
while
he
on
the
contrary
with
his
dreadful
claws
tore
away
plate
and
mail
from
the
paladin
rinaldo
began
to
think
his
last
hour
was
come
and
cast
his
eyes
around
and
above
to
see
if
there
was
any
means
of
escape
he
perceived
a
beam
projecting
from
the
wall
at
the
height
of
some
ten
feet
and
taking
a
leap
almost
miraculous
he
succeeded
in
reaching
it
and
in
flinging
himself
up
across
it
here
he
sat
for
hours
the
hideous
brute
continually
trying
to
reach
him
all
at
once
he
heard
the
sound
of
something
coming
through
the
air
like
a
bird
and
suddenly
angelica
herself
alighted
on
the
end
of
the
beam
she
held
something
in
her
hand
towards
him
and
spoke
to
him
in
a
loving
voice
but
the
moment
rinaldo
saw
her
he
commanded
her
to
go
away
refused
all
her
offers
of
assistance
and
at
length
declared
that
if
she
did
not
leave
him
he
would
cast
himself
down
to
the
monster
and
meet
his
fate
angelica
saying
she
would
lose
her
life
rather
than
displease
him
departed
but
first
she
threw
to
the
monster
a
cake
of
wax
she
had
prepared
and
spread
around
him
a
rope
knotted
with
nooses
the
beast
took
the
bait
and
finding
his
teeth
glued
together
by
the
wax
vented
his
fury
in
bounds
and
leaps
and
soon
getting
entangled
in
the
nooses
drew
them
tight
by
his
struggles
so
that
he
could
scarcely
move
a
limb
rinaldo
watching
his
chance
leapt
down
upon
his
back
seized
him
round
the
neck
and
throttled
him
not
relaxing
his
gripe
till
the
beast
fell
dead
another
difficulty
remained
to
be
overcome
the
walls
were
of
immense
height
and
the
only
opening
in
them
was
a
grated
window
of
such
strength
that
he
could
not
break
the
bars
in
his
distress
rinaldo
found
a
file
which
angelica
had
left
on
the
ground
and
with
the
help
of
this
effected
his
deliverance
what
further
adventures
he
met
with
will
be
told
in
another
chapter
the
siege
of
albracca
at
the
very
time
when
charlemagne
was
holding
his
plenary
court
and
his
great
tournament
his
kingdom
was
invaded
by
a
mighty
monarch
who
was
moreover
so
valiant
and
strong
in
battle
that
no
one
could
stand
against
him
he
was
named
gradasso
and
his
kingdom
was
called
sericane
now
as
it
often
happens
to
the
greatest
and
the
richest
to
long
for
what
they
can
not
have
and
thus
to
lose
what
they
already
possess
this
king
could
not
rest
content
without
durindana
the
sword
of
orlando
and
bayard
the
horse
of
rinaldo
to
obtain
these
he
determined
to
war
upon
france
and
for
this
purpose
put
in
array
a
mighty
army
he
took
his
way
through
spain
and
after
defeating
marsilius
the
king
of
that
country
in
several
battles
was
rapidly
advancing
on
france
charlemagne
though
marsilius
was
a
saracen
and
had
been
his
enemy
yet
felt
it
needful
to
succor
him
in
this
extremity
from
a
consideration
of
common
danger
and
with
the
consent
of
his
peers
despatched
rinaldo
with
a
strong
body
of
soldiers
against
gradasso
there
was
much
fighting
with
doubtful
results
and
gradasso
was
steadily
advancing
into
france
but
impatient
to
achieve
his
objects
he
challenged
rinaldo
to
single
combat
to
be
fought
on
foot
and
upon
these
conditions
if
rinaldo
conquered
gradasso
agreed
to
give
up
all
his
prisoners
and
return
to
his
own
country
but
if
gradasso
won
the
day
he
was
to
have
bayard
the
challenge
was
accepted
and
would
have
been
fought
had
it
not
been
for
the
arts
of
malagigi
who
just
then
returned
from
kingdom
with
set
purpose
to
win
rinaldo
to
look
with
favor
upon
the
fair
princess
who
was
dying
for
love
of
him
malagigi
drew
rinaldo
away
from
the
army
by
putting
on
the
semblance
of
gradasso
and
after
a
short
contest
pretending
to
fly
before
him
by
which
means
rinaldo
was
induced
to
follow
him
into
a
boat
in
which
he
was
borne
away
and
entangled
in
various
adventures
as
we
have
already
related
the
army
left
under
the
command
of
ricciardetto
rinaldo
brother
was
soon
joined
by
charlemagne
and
all
his
peerage
but
experienced
a
disastrous
rout
and
the
emperor
and
many
of
his
paladins
were
taken
prisoners
gradasso
however
did
not
abuse
his
victory
he
took
charles
by
the
hand
seated
him
by
his
side
and
told
him
he
warred
only
for
honor
he
renounced
all
conquests
on
condition
that
the
emperor
should
deliver
to
him
bayard
and
durindana
both
of
them
the
property
of
his
vassals
the
former
of
which
as
he
maintained
was
already
forfeited
to
him
by
rinaldo
failure
to
meet
him
as
agreed
to
these
terms
charlemagne
readily
acceded
bayard
after
the
departure
of
his
master
had
been
taken
in
charge
by
ricciardetto
and
sent
back
to
paris
where
astolpho
was
in
command
in
the
absence
of
charlemagne
astolpho
received
with
great
indignation
the
message
despatched
for
bayard
and
replied
by
a
herald
that
he
would
not
surrender
the
horse
of
his
kinsman
rinaldo
without
a
contest
if
gradasso
wanted
the
steed
he
might
come
and
take
him
and
that
he
astolpho
was
ready
to
meet
him
in
the
field
gradasso
was
only
amused
at
this
answer
for
astolpho
fame
as
a
successful
warrior
was
not
high
and
gradasso
willingly
renewed
with
him
the
bargain
which
he
had
made
with
rinaldo
on
these
conditions
the
battle
was
fought
the
enchanted
lance
in
the
hands
of
astolpho
performed
a
new
wonder
and
gradasso
the
terrible
gradasso
was
unhorsed
he
kept
his
word
set
free
his
prisoners
and
put
his
army
on
the
march
to
return
to
his
own
country
renewing
his
oath
however
not
to
rest
till
he
had
taken
from
rinaldo
his
horse
and
from
orlando
his
sword
or
lost
his
life
in
the
attempt
charlemagne
full
of
gratitude
to
astolpho
would
have
kept
him
near
his
person
and
loaded
him
with
honors
but
astolpho
preferred
to
seek
rinaldo
with
the
view
of
restoring
to
him
his
horse
and
departed
from
paris
with
that
design
our
story
now
returns
to
orlando
whom
we
left
fascinated
with
the
sight
of
the
sleeping
beauty
who
however
escaped
him
while
engaged
in
the
combat
with
ferrau
having
long
sought
her
in
vain
through
the
recesses
of
the
wood
he
resolved
to
follow
her
to
her
father
court
leaving
therefore
the
camp
of
charlemagne
he
travelled
long
in
the
direction
of
the
east
making
inquiry
everywhere
if
perchance
he
might
get
tidings
of
the
fugitive
after
many
adventures
he
arrived
one
day
at
a
place
where
many
roads
crossed
and
meeting
there
a
courier
he
asked
him
for
news
the
courier
replied
that
he
had
been
despatched
by
angelica
to
solicit
the
aid
of
sacripant
king
of
circassia
in
favor
of
her
father
galafron
who
was
besieged
in
his
city
albracca
by
agrican
king
of
tartary
this
agrican
had
been
an
unsuccessful
suitor
to
the
damsel
whom
he
now
pursued
with
arms
orlando
thus
learned
that
he
was
within
a
day
journey
of
albracca
and
feeling
now
secure
of
angelica
he
proceeded
with
all
speed
to
her
city
thus
journeying
he
arrived
at
a
bridge
under
which
flowed
a
foaming
river
here
a
damsel
met
him
with
a
goblet
and
informed
him
that
it
was
the
usage
of
this
bridge
to
present
the
traveller
with
a
cup
orlando
accepted
the
offered
cup
and
drank
its
contents
he
had
no
sooner
done
so
than
his
brain
reeled
and
he
became
unconscious
of
the
object
of
his
journey
and
of
everything
else
under
the
influence
of
this
fascination
he
followed
the
damsel
into
a
magnificent
and
marvellous
palace
here
he
found
himself
in
company
with
many
knights
unknown
to
him
and
to
each
other
though
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
cup
of
oblivion
of
which
they
all
had
partaken
they
would
have
found
themselves
brothers
in
arms
astolpho
proceeding
on
his
way
to
seek
rinaldo
splendidly
dressed
and
equipped
as
was
his
wont
arrived
in
circassia
and
found
there
a
great
army
encamped
under
the
command
of
sacripant
the
king
of
that
country
who
was
leading
it
to
the
defence
of
galafron
the
father
of
angelica
sacripant
much
struck
by
the
appearance
of
astolpho
and
his
horse
accosted
him
courteously
and
tried
to
enlist
him
in
his
service
but
astolpho
proud
of
his
late
victories
scornfully
declined
his
offers
and
pursued
his
way
king
sacripant
was
too
much
attracted
by
his
appearance
to
part
with
him
so
easily
and
having
laid
aside
his
kingly
ornaments
set
out
in
pursuit
of
him
astolpho
next
day
encountered
on
his
way
a
stranger
knight
named
sir
florismart
lord
of
the
sylvan
tower
one
of
the
bravest
and
best
of
knights
having
as
his
guide
a
damsel
young
fair
and
virtuous
to
whom
he
was
tenderly
attached
whose
name
was
flordelis
astolpho
as
he
approached
defied
the
knight
bidding
him
yield
the
lady
or
prepare
to
maintain
his
right
by
arms
florismart
accepted
the
contest
and
the
knights
encountered
florismart
was
unhorsed
and
his
steed
fell
dead
while
bayard
sustained
no
injury
by
the
shock
florismart
was
so
overwhelmed
with
despair
at
his
own
disgrace
and
the
sight
of
the
damsel
distress
that
he
drew
his
sword
and
was
about
to
plunge
it
into
his
own
bosom
but
astolpho
held
his
hand
told
him
that
he
contended
only
for
glory
and
was
contented
to
leave
him
the
lady
while
florismart
and
flordelis
were
vowing
eternal
gratitude
king
sacripant
arrived
and
coveting
the
damsel
of
the
one
champion
as
much
as
the
horse
and
arms
of
the
other
defied
them
to
the
joust
astolpho
met
the
challenger
whom
he
instantly
overthrew
and
presented
his
courser
to
florismart
leaving
the
king
to
return
to
his
army
on
foot
the
friends
pursued
their
route
and
ere
long
flordelis
discovered
by
signs
which
were
known
to
her
that
they
were
approaching
the
waters
of
oblivion
and
advised
them
to
turn
back
or
to
change
their
course
this
the
knights
would
not
hear
of
and
continuing
their
march
they
soon
arrived
at
the
bridge
where
orlando
had
been
taken
prisoner
the
damsel
of
the
bridge
appeared
as
before
with
the
enchanted
cup
but
astolpho
forewarned
rejected
it
with
scorn
she
dashed
it
to
the
ground
and
a
fire
blazed
up
which
rendered
the
bridge
unapproachable
at
the
same
moment
the
two
knights
were
assailed
by
sundry
warriors
known
and
unknown
who
having
no
recollection
of
anything
joined
blindly
in
defence
of
their
among
these
was
orlando
at
sight
of
whom
astolpho
with
all
his
confidence
not
daring
to
encounter
him
turned
and
fled
owing
his
escape
to
the
strength
and
fleetness
of
bayard
florismart
meanwhile
overlaid
by
fearful
odds
was
compelled
to
yield
to
necessity
and
comply
with
the
usage
of
the
fairy
he
drank
of
the
cup
and
remained
prisoner
with
the
rest
flordelis
deprived
of
her
two
friends
retired
from
the
scene
and
devoted
herself
to
untiring
efforts
to
effect
her
lover
deliverance
astolpho
pursued
his
way
to
albracca
which
agrican
was
about
to
besiege
he
was
kindly
welcomed
by
angelica
and
enrolled
among
her
defenders
impatient
to
distinguish
himself
he
one
night
sallied
forth
alone
arrived
in
agrican
camp
and
unhorsed
his
warriors
right
and
left
by
means
of
the
enchanted
lance
but
he
was
soon
surrounded
and
overmatched
and
made
prisoner
to
agrican
relief
was
however
at
hand
for
as
the
citizens
and
soldiers
were
one
day
leaning
over
their
walls
they
descried
a
cloud
of
dust
from
which
horsemen
were
seen
to
prick
forth
as
it
rolled
on
towards
the
camp
of
the
besiegers
this
turned
out
to
be
the
army
of
sacripant
which
immediately
attacked
that
of
agrican
with
the
view
of
cutting
a
passage
through
his
camp
to
the
besieged
city
but
agrican
mounted
upon
bayard
taken
from
astolpho
but
not
armed
with
the
lance
of
gold
the
virtues
of
which
were
unknown
to
him
performed
wonders
and
rallied
his
scattered
troops
which
had
given
way
to
the
sudden
and
unexpected
assault
sacripant
on
the
other
hand
encouraged
his
men
by
the
most
desperate
acts
of
valor
having
as
an
additional
incentive
to
his
courage
the
sight
of
angelica
who
showed
herself
upon
the
city
walls
there
she
witnessed
a
single
combat
between
the
two
leaders
agrican
and
sacripant
in
this
at
length
her
defender
appeared
to
be
overmatched
when
the
circassians
broke
the
ring
and
separated
the
combatants
who
were
borne
asunder
in
the
rush
sacripant
severely
wounded
profited
by
the
confusion
and
escaped
into
albracca
where
he
was
kindly
received
and
carefully
tended
by
angelica
the
battle
continuing
the
circassians
were
at
last
put
to
flight
and
being
intercepted
between
the
enemy
lines
and
the
town
sought
for
refuge
under
the
walls
angelica
ordered
the
drawbridge
to
be
let
down
and
the
gates
thrown
open
to
the
fugitives
with
these
agrican
not
distinguished
in
the
crowd
entered
the
place
driving
both
circassians
and
cathayans
before
him
and
the
portcullis
being
dropped
he
was
shut
in
for
a
time
the
terror
which
he
inspired
put
to
flight
all
opposers
but
when
at
last
it
came
to
be
known
that
few
or
none
of
his
followers
had
effected
an
entrance
with
him
the
fugitives
rallied
and
surrounded
him
on
all
sides
while
he
was
thus
apparently
reduced
to
the
last
extremities
he
was
saved
by
the
very
circumstance
which
threatened
him
with
destruction
the
soldiers
of
angelica
closing
upon
him
from
all
sides
deserted
their
defences
and
his
own
besieging
army
entered
the
city
in
a
part
where
the
wall
was
broken
down
in
this
way
was
agrican
rescued
the
city
taken
and
the
inhabitants
put
to
the
sword
angelica
however
with
some
of
the
knights
who
were
her
defenders
among
whom
was
sacripant
saved
herself
in
the
citadel
which
was
planted
upon
a
rock
the
fortress
was
impregnable
but
it
was
scantily
victualled
and
ill
provided
with
other
necessaries
under
these
circumstances
angelica
announced
to
those
blockaded
with
her
in
the
citadel
her
intention
to
go
in
quest
of
assistance
and
having
plighted
her
promise
of
a
speedy
return
she
set
out
with
the
enchanted
ring
upon
her
finger
mounted
upon
her
palfrey
the
damsel
passed
through
the
enemy
lines
and
by
sunrise
was
many
miles
clear
of
their
encampment
it
so
happened
that
her
road
led
her
near
the
fatal
bridge
of
oblivion
and
as
she
approached
it
she
met
a
damsel
weeping
bitterly
it
was
flordelis
whose
lover
florismart
as
we
have
related
had
met
the
fate
of
orlando
and
many
more
and
fallen
a
victim
to
the
enchantress
of
the
cup
she
related
her
adventures
to
angelica
and
conjured
her
to
lend
what
aid
she
might
to
rescue
her
lord
and
his
companions
angelica
accordingly
watching
her
opportunity
and
aided
by
her
ring
slipped
into
the
castle
unseen
when
the
door
was
opened
to
admit
a
new
victim
here
she
speedily
disenchanted
orlando
and
the
rest
by
a
touch
of
her
talisman
but
florismart
was
not
there
he
had
been
given
up
to
falerina
a
more
powerful
enchantress
and
was
still
in
durance
angelica
conjured
the
rescued
captives
to
assist
her
in
the
recovery
of
her
kingdom
and
all
departed
together
for
albracca
the
arrival
of
orlando
with
his
companions
nine
in
all
and
among
the
bravest
knights
of
france
changed
at
once
the
fortunes
of
the
war
wherever
the
great
paladin
came
pennon
and
standard
fell
before
him
agrican
in
vain
attempted
to
rally
his
troops
orlando
kept
constantly
in
his
front
forcing
him
to
attend
to
nobody
else
the
tartar
king
at
length
bethought
him
of
a
stratagem
he
turned
his
horse
and
made
a
show
of
flying
in
despair
orlando
dashed
after
him
as
he
desired
and
agrican
fled
till
he
reached
a
green
place
in
a
wood
where
there
was
a
fountain
the
place
was
beautiful
and
the
tartar
dismounted
to
refresh
himself
at
the
fountain
but
without
taking
off
his
helmet
or
laying
aside
any
of
his
armor
orlando
was
quickly
at
his
back
crying
out
so
bold
and
yet
a
fugitive
how
could
you
fly
from
a
single
arm
and
think
to
escape
the
tartar
king
had
leaped
on
his
saddle
the
moment
he
saw
his
enemy
and
when
the
paladin
had
done
speaking
he
said
in
a
mild
voice
without
doubt
you
are
the
best
knight
i
ever
encountered
and
fain
would
i
leave
you
untouched
for
your
own
sake
if
you
would
cease
to
hinder
me
from
rallying
my
people
i
pretended
to
fly
in
order
to
bring
you
out
of
the
field
if
you
insist
upon
fighting
i
must
needs
fight
and
slay
you
but
i
call
the
sun
in
the
heavens
to
witness
i
would
rather
not
i
should
be
very
sorry
for
your
death
the
count
orlando
felt
pity
for
so
much
gallantry
and
he
said
the
nobler
you
show
yourself
the
more
it
grieves
me
to
think
that
in
dying
without
a
knowledge
of
the
true
faith
you
will
be
lost
in
the
other
world
let
me
advise
you
to
save
body
and
soul
at
once
receive
baptism
and
go
your
way
in
peace
agrican
replied
i
suspect
you
to
be
the
paladin
orlando
if
you
are
i
would
not
lose
this
opportunity
of
fighting
with
you
to
be
king
of
paradise
talk
to
me
no
more
about
your
things
of
another
world
for
you
will
preach
in
vain
each
of
us
for
himself
and
let
the
sword
be
umpire
the
saracen
drew
his
sword
boldly
advancing
upon
orlando
and
a
combat
began
so
obstinate
and
so
long
each
warrior
being
a
miracle
of
prowess
that
the
story
says
it
lasted
from
noon
till
night
orlando
then
seeing
the
stars
come
out
was
the
first
to
propose
a
respite
what
are
we
to
do
said
he
now
that
daylight
has
left
us
agrican
answered
readily
enough
let
us
repose
in
this
meadow
and
renew
the
combat
at
dawn
the
repose
was
taken
accordingly
each
tied
up
his
horse
and
reclined
himself
on
the
grass
not
far
from
the
other
just
as
if
they
had
been
friends
orlando
by
the
fountain
agrican
beneath
a
pine
it
was
a
beautiful
clear
night
and
as
they
talked
together
before
addressing
themselves
to
sleep
the
champion
of
christendom
looking
up
at
the
firmament
said
that
is
a
fine
piece
of
workmanship
that
starry
spectacle
god
made
it
all
that
moon
of
silver
and
those
stars
of
gold
and
the
light
of
day
and
the
sun
all
for
the
sake
of
human
kind
you
wish
i
see
to
talk
of
matters
of
faith
said
the
tartar
now
i
may
as
well
tell
you
at
once
that
i
have
no
sort
of
skill
in
such
matters
nor
learning
of
any
kind
i
never
could
learn
anything
when
i
was
a
boy
i
hated
it
so
that
i
broke
the
man
head
who
was
commissioned
to
teach
me
and
it
produced
such
an
effect
on
others
that
nobody
ever
afterwards
dared
so
much
as
show
me
a
book
my
boyhood
was
therefore
passed
as
it
should
be
in
horsemanship
and
hunting
and
learning
to
fight
what
is
the
good
of
a
gentleman
poring
all
day
over
a
book
prowess
to
the
knight
and
preaching
to
the
clergyman
that
is
my
motto
i
acknowledge
returned
orlando
that
arms
are
the
first
consideration
of
a
gentleman
but
not
at
all
that
he
does
himself
dishonor
by
knowledge
on
the
contrary
knowledge
is
as
great
an
embellishment
of
the
rest
of
his
attainments
as
the
flowers
are
to
the
meadow
before
us
and
as
to
the
knowledge
of
his
maker
the
man
that
is
without
it
is
no
better
than
a
stock
or
a
stone
or
a
brute
beast
neither
without
study
can
he
reach
anything
of
a
due
sense
of
the
depth
and
divineness
of
the
contemplation
learned
or
not
learned
said
agrican
you
might
show
yourself
better
bred
than
by
endeavoring
to
make
me
talk
on
a
subject
on
which
you
have
me
at
a
disadvantage
if
you
choose
to
sleep
i
wish
you
good
night
but
if
you
prefer
talking
i
recommend
you
to
talk
of
fighting
or
of
fair
ladies
and
by
the
way
pray
tell
me
are
you
not
that
orlando
who
makes
such
a
noise
in
the
world
and
what
is
it
pray
that
brings
you
into
these
parts
were
you
ever
in
love
i
suppose
you
must
have
been
for
to
be
a
knight
and
never
to
have
been
in
love
would
be
like
being
a
man
without
a
heart
in
his
breast
the
count
replied
orlando
i
am
and
in
love
i
am
love
has
made
me
abandon
everything
and
brought
me
into
these
distant
regions
and
to
tell
you
all
in
one
word
my
heart
is
in
the
hands
of
the
daughter
of
king
galafron
you
have
come
against
him
with
fire
and
sword
to
get
possession
of
his
castles
and
his
dominions
and
i
have
come
to
help
him
for
no
object
in
the
world
but
to
please
his
daughter
and
win
her
beautiful
hand
i
care
for
nothing
else
in
existence
now
when
the
tartar
king
agrican
heard
his
antagonist
speak
in
this
manner
and
knew
him
to
be
indeed
orlando
and
to
be
in
love
with
angelica
his
face
changed
color
for
grief
and
jealousy
though
it
could
not
be
seen
for
the
darkness
his
heart
began
beating
with
such
violence
that
he
felt
as
if
he
should
have
died
well
said
he
to
orlando
we
are
to
fight
when
it
is
daylight
and
one
or
other
is
to
be
left
here
dead
on
the
ground
i
have
a
proposal
to
make
to
you
nay
an
entreaty
my
love
is
so
excessive
for
the
same
lady
that
i
beg
you
to
leave
her
to
me
i
will
owe
you
my
thanks
and
give
up
the
siege
and
put
an
end
to
the
war
i
can
not
bear
that
any
one
should
love
her
and
that
i
should
live
to
see
it
why
therefore
should
either
of
us
perish
give
her
up
not
a
soul
shall
know
it
i
never
yet
answered
orlando
made
a
promise
which
i
did
not
keep
and
nevertheless
i
own
to
you
that
were
i
to
make
a
promise
like
that
and
even
swear
to
keep
it
i
should
not
you
might
as
well
ask
me
to
tear
away
the
limbs
from
my
body
and
the
eyes
out
of
my
head
i
could
as
well
live
without
breath
itself
as
cease
loving
angelica
agrican
had
hardly
patience
to
let
him
finish
speaking
ere
he
leapt
furiously
on
horseback
though
it
was
midnight
quit
her
said
he
or
die
orlando
seeing
the
infidel
getting
up
and
not
being
sure
that
he
would
not
add
treachery
to
fierceness
had
been
hardly
less
quick
in
mounting
for
the
combat
never
exclaimed
he
i
never
could
have
quitted
her
if
i
would
and
now
i
would
not
if
i
could
you
must
seek
her
by
other
means
than
these
fiercely
dashed
their
horses
together
in
the
nighttime
on
the
green
mead
despiteful
and
terrible
were
the
blows
they
gave
and
took
by
the
moonlight
agrican
fought
in
a
rage
orlando
was
cooler
and
now
the
struggle
had
lasted
more
than
five
hours
and
day
began
to
dawn
when
the
tartar
king
furious
to
find
so
much
trouble
given
him
dealt
his
enemy
a
blow
sharp
and
violent
beyond
conception
it
cut
the
shield
in
two
as
if
it
had
been
made
of
wood
and
though
blood
could
not
be
drawn
from
orlando
because
he
was
fated
it
shook
and
bruised
him
as
if
it
had
started
every
joint
in
his
body
his
body
only
however
not
a
particle
of
his
soul
so
dreadful
was
the
blow
which
the
paladin
gave
in
return
that
not
only
shield
but
every
bit
of
mail
on
the
body
of
agrican
was
broken
in
pieces
and
three
of
his
ribs
cut
asunder
the
tartar
roaring
like
a
lion
raised
his
sword
with
still
greater
vehemence
than
before
and
dealt
a
blow
on
the
paladin
helmet
such
as
he
had
never
yet
received
from
mortal
man
for
a
moment
it
took
away
his
senses
his
sight
failed
his
ears
tingled
his
frightened
horse
turned
about
to
fly
and
he
was
falling
from
the
saddle
when
the
very
action
of
falling
threw
his
head
upwards
and
thus
recalled
his
recollection
what
a
shame
is
this
thought
he
how
shall
i
ever
again
dare
to
face
angelica
i
have
been
fighting
hour
after
hour
with
this
man
and
he
is
but
one
and
i
call
myself
orlando
if
the
combat
last
any
longer
i
will
bury
myself
in
a
monastery
and
never
look
on
sword
again
orlando
muttered
with
his
lips
closed
and
his
teeth
ground
together
and
you
might
have
thought
that
fire
instead
of
breath
came
out
of
his
nose
and
mouth
he
raised
his
sword
durindana
with
both
his
hands
and
sent
it
down
so
tremendously
on
agrican
shoulder
that
it
cut
through
breastplate
down
to
the
very
haunch
nay
crushed
the
though
it
was
made
of
bone
and
iron
and
felled
man
and
horse
to
the
earth
agrican
turned
as
white
as
ashes
and
felt
death
upon
him
he
called
orlando
to
come
close
to
him
with
a
gentle
voice
and
said
as
well
as
he
could
i
believe
on
him
who
died
on
the
cross
baptize
me
i
pray
thee
with
the
fountain
before
my
senses
are
gone
i
have
lived
an
evil
life
but
need
not
be
rebellious
to
god
in
death
also
may
he
who
came
to
save
all
the
rest
of
the
world
save
me
and
he
shed
tears
that
great
king
though
he
had
been
so
lofty
and
fierce
orlando
dismounted
quickly
with
his
own
face
in
tears
he
gathered
the
king
tenderly
in
his
arms
and
took
and
laid
him
by
the
fountain
on
a
marble
rim
that
it
had
and
then
he
wept
in
concert
with
him
heartily
and
asked
his
pardon
and
so
baptized
him
in
the
water
of
the
fountain
and
knelt
and
prayed
to
god
for
him
with
joined
hands
he
then
paused
and
looked
at
him
and
when
he
perceived
his
countenance
changed
and
that
his
whole
person
was
cold
he
left
him
there
on
the
marble
rim
of
the
fountain
all
armed
as
he
was
with
the
sword
by
his
side
and
the
crown
upon
his
head
adventures
of
rinaldo
and
orlando
we
left
rinaldo
when
having
overcome
the
monster
he
quitted
the
castle
of
altaripa
and
pursued
his
way
on
foot
he
soon
met
with
a
weeping
damsel
who
being
questioned
as
to
the
cause
of
her
sorrow
told
him
she
was
in
search
of
one
to
do
battle
to
rescue
her
lover
who
had
been
made
prisoner
by
a
vile
enchantress
together
with
orlando
and
many
more
the
damsel
was
flordelis
the
of
florismart
and
rinaldo
promised
his
assistance
trusting
to
accomplish
the
adventure
either
by
valor
or
skill
flordelis
insisted
upon
rinaldo
taking
her
horse
which
he
consented
to
do
on
condition
of
her
mounting
behind
him
as
they
rode
on
through
a
wood
they
heard
strange
noises
and
rinaldo
reassuring
the
damsel
pressed
forward
towards
the
quarter
from
which
they
proceeded
he
soon
perceived
a
giant
standing
under
a
vaulted
cavern
with
a
huge
club
in
his
hand
and
of
an
appearance
to
strike
the
boldest
spirit
with
dread
by
the
side
of
the
cavern
was
chained
a
griffin
which
together
with
the
giant
was
stationed
there
to
guard
a
wonderful
horse
the
same
which
was
once
argalia
this
horse
was
a
creature
of
enchantment
matchless
in
vigor
speed
and
form
which
disdained
to
share
the
diet
of
his
corn
or
grass
and
fed
only
on
air
his
name
was
rabican
this
marvellous
horse
after
his
master
argalia
had
been
slain
by
ferrau
finding
himself
at
liberty
returned
to
his
native
cavern
and
was
here
stabled
under
the
protection
of
the
giant
and
the
griffin
as
rinaldo
approached
the
giant
assailed
him
with
his
club
rinaldo
defended
himself
from
the
giant
blows
and
gave
him
one
in
return
which
if
his
skin
had
not
been
of
the
toughest
would
have
finished
the
combat
but
the
giant
though
wounded
escaped
and
let
loose
the
griffin
this
monstrous
bird
towered
in
air
and
thence
pounced
down
upon
rinaldo
who
watching
his
opportunity
dealt
her
a
desperate
wound
she
had
however
strength
for
another
flight
and
kept
repeating
her
attacks
which
rinaldo
parried
as
he
could
while
the
damsel
stood
trembling
by
witnessing
the
contest
the
battle
continued
rendered
more
terrible
by
the
approach
of
night
when
rinaldo
determined
upon
a
desperate
expedient
to
bring
it
to
a
conclusion
he
fell
as
if
fainting
from
his
wounds
and
on
the
close
approach
of
the
griffin
dealt
her
a
blow
which
sheared
away
one
of
her
wings
the
beast
though
sinking
griped
him
fast
with
her
talons
digging
through
plate
and
mail
but
rinaldo
plied
his
sword
in
utter
desperation
and
at
last
accomplished
her
destruction
rinaldo
then
entered
the
cavern
and
found
there
the
wonderful
horse
all
caparisoned
he
was
except
for
a
star
of
white
on
his
forehead
and
one
white
foot
behind
for
speed
he
was
unrivalled
though
in
strength
he
yielded
to
bayard
rinaldo
mounted
upon
rabican
and
issued
from
the
cavern
as
he
pursued
his
way
he
met
a
fugitive
from
agrican
army
who
gave
such
an
account
of
the
prowess
of
a
champion
who
fought
on
the
side
of
angelica
that
rinaldo
was
persuaded
this
must
be
orlando
though
at
a
loss
to
imagine
how
he
could
have
been
freed
from
captivity
he
determined
to
repair
to
the
scene
of
the
contest
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
and
flordelis
hoping
to
find
florismart
with
orlando
consented
to
accompany
him
while
these
things
were
doing
all
was
rout
and
dismay
in
the
tartarian
army
from
the
death
of
agrican
king
galafron
arriving
at
this
juncture
with
an
army
for
the
relief
of
his
capital
albracca
assaulted
the
enemy
camp
and
carried
all
before
him
rinaldo
had
now
reached
the
scene
of
action
and
was
looking
on
as
an
unconcerned
spectator
when
he
was
espied
by
galafron
the
king
instantly
recognized
the
horse
rabican
which
he
had
given
to
argalia
when
he
sent
him
forth
on
his
mission
to
paris
possessed
with
the
idea
that
the
rider
of
the
horse
was
the
murderer
of
argalia
galafron
rode
at
rinaldo
and
smote
him
with
all
his
force
rinaldo
was
not
slow
to
avenge
the
blow
and
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
the
king
had
not
his
followers
instantly
closed
round
him
and
separated
the
combatants
rinaldo
thus
found
himself
almost
without
his
own
choice
enlisted
on
the
side
of
the
enemies
of
angelica
which
gave
him
no
concern
so
completely
had
his
draught
from
the
fountain
of
hate
steeled
his
mind
against
her
for
several
successive
days
the
struggle
continued
without
any
important
results
rinaldo
meeting
the
bravest
knights
of
party
and
defeating
them
one
after
the
other
at
length
he
encountered
orlando
and
the
two
knights
bitterly
reproached
one
another
for
the
cause
they
had
each
adopted
and
engaged
in
a
furious
combat
orlando
was
mounted
upon
bayard
rinaldo
horse
which
agrican
had
by
chance
become
possessed
of
and
orlando
had
taken
from
him
as
the
prize
of
victory
bayard
would
not
fight
against
his
master
and
orlando
was
getting
the
worse
of
the
encounter
when
suddenly
rinaldo
seeing
astolpho
who
for
love
of
him
had
arrayed
himself
on
his
side
hard
beset
by
numbers
left
orlando
to
rush
to
the
defence
of
his
friend
night
prevented
the
combat
from
being
renewed
but
a
challenge
was
given
and
accepted
for
their
next
meeting
but
angelica
sighing
in
her
heart
for
rinaldo
was
not
willing
that
he
should
be
again
exposed
to
so
terrible
a
venture
she
begged
a
boon
of
orlando
promising
she
would
be
his
if
he
would
do
her
bidding
on
receiving
his
promise
she
enjoined
him
to
set
out
without
delay
to
destroy
the
garden
of
the
enchantress
falerina
in
which
many
valiant
knights
had
been
entrapped
and
were
imprisoned
orlando
departed
on
his
horse
brigliadoro
leaving
bayard
in
disgrace
for
his
bad
deportment
the
day
before
angelica
to
conciliate
rinaldo
sent
bayard
to
him
but
rinaldo
remained
unmoved
by
this
as
by
all
her
former
acts
of
kindness
when
rinaldo
learned
orlando
departure
he
yielded
to
the
entreaties
of
the
lady
of
florismart
and
prepared
to
fulfil
his
promise
and
rescue
her
lover
from
the
power
of
the
enchantress
thus
both
rinaldo
and
orlando
were
bound
upon
the
same
adventure
but
unknown
to
one
another
the
castle
of
falerina
was
protected
by
a
river
which
was
crossed
by
a
bridge
kept
by
a
ruffian
who
challenged
all
comers
to
the
combat
and
such
was
his
strength
that
he
had
thus
far
prevailed
in
every
encounter
as
appeared
by
the
arms
of
various
knights
which
he
had
taken
from
them
and
piled
up
as
a
trophy
on
the
shore
rinaldo
attacked
him
but
with
as
bad
success
as
the
rest
for
the
struck
him
so
violent
a
blow
with
an
iron
mace
that
he
fell
to
the
ground
but
when
the
villain
approached
to
strip
him
of
his
armor
rinaldo
seized
him
and
the
being
unable
to
free
himself
leapt
with
rinaldo
into
the
lake
where
they
both
disappeared
orlando
meanwhile
in
discharge
of
his
promise
to
angelica
pursued
his
way
in
quest
of
the
same
adventure
in
passing
through
a
wood
he
saw
a
cavalier
armed
at
all
points
and
mounted
keeping
guard
over
a
lady
who
was
bound
to
a
tree
weeping
bitterly
orlando
hastened
to
her
relief
but
was
exhorted
by
the
knight
not
to
interfere
for
she
had
deserved
her
fate
by
her
wickedness
in
proof
of
which
he
made
certain
charges
against
her
the
lady
denied
them
all
and
orlando
believed
her
defied
the
knight
overthrew
him
and
releasing
the
lady
departed
with
her
seated
on
his
horse
croup
while
they
rode
another
damsel
approached
on
a
white
palfrey
who
warned
orlando
of
impending
danger
and
informed
him
that
he
was
near
the
garden
of
the
enchantress
orlando
was
delighted
with
the
intelligence
and
entreated
her
to
inform
him
how
he
was
to
gain
admittance
she
replied
that
the
garden
could
only
be
entered
at
sunrise
and
gave
him
such
instructions
as
would
enable
him
to
gain
admittance
she
gave
him
also
a
book
in
which
was
painted
the
garden
and
all
that
it
contained
together
with
the
palace
of
the
false
enchantress
where
she
had
secluded
herself
for
the
purpose
of
executing
a
magic
work
in
which
she
was
engaged
this
was
the
manufacture
of
a
sword
capable
of
cutting
even
through
enchanted
substances
the
object
of
this
labor
the
damsel
told
him
was
the
destruction
of
a
knight
of
the
west
by
name
orlando
who
she
had
read
in
the
book
of
fate
was
coming
to
demolish
her
garden
having
thus
instructed
him
the
damsel
departed
orlando
finding
he
must
delay
his
enterprise
till
the
next
morning
now
lay
down
and
was
soon
asleep
seeing
this
the
base
woman
whom
he
had
rescued
and
who
was
intent
on
making
her
escape
to
rejoin
her
paramour
mounted
brigliadoro
and
rode
off
carrying
away
durindana
when
orlando
awoke
his
indignation
as
may
be
supposed
was
great
on
the
discovery
of
the
theft
but
like
a
good
knight
and
true
he
was
not
to
be
diverted
from
his
enterprise
he
tore
off
a
huge
branch
of
an
elm
to
supply
the
place
of
his
sword
and
as
the
sun
rose
took
his
way
towards
the
gate
of
the
garden
where
a
dragon
was
on
his
watch
this
he
slew
by
repeated
blows
and
entered
the
garden
the
gate
of
which
closed
behind
him
barring
retreat
looking
round
him
he
saw
a
fair
fountain
which
overflowed
into
a
river
and
in
the
centre
of
the
fountain
a
figure
on
whose
forehead
was
written
the
stream
which
waters
violet
and
rose
from
hence
to
the
enchanted
palace
goes
following
the
banks
of
this
flowing
stream
and
rapt
in
the
delights
of
the
charming
garden
orlando
arrived
at
the
palace
and
entering
it
found
the
mistress
clad
in
white
with
a
crown
of
gold
upon
her
head
in
the
act
of
viewing
herself
in
the
surface
of
the
magic
sword
orlando
surprised
her
before
she
could
escape
deprived
her
of
the
weapon
and
holding
her
fast
by
her
long
hair
which
floated
behind
threatened
her
with
immediate
death
if
she
did
not
yield
up
her
prisoners
and
afford
him
the
means
of
egress
she
however
was
firm
of
purpose
making
no
reply
and
orlando
unable
to
move
her
either
by
threats
or
entreaties
was
under
the
necessity
of
binding
her
to
a
beech
and
pursuing
his
quest
as
he
best
might
he
then
bethought
him
of
his
book
and
consulting
it
found
that
there
was
an
outlet
to
the
south
but
that
to
reach
it
a
lake
was
to
be
passed
inhabited
by
a
siren
whose
song
was
so
entrancing
as
to
be
quite
irresistible
to
whoever
heard
it
but
his
book
instructed
him
how
to
protect
himself
against
this
danger
according
to
its
directions
while
pursuing
his
path
he
gathered
abundance
of
flowers
which
sprung
all
around
and
filled
his
helmet
and
his
ears
with
them
then
listened
if
he
heard
the
birds
sing
finding
that
though
he
saw
the
gaping
beak
the
swelling
throat
and
ruffled
plumes
he
could
not
catch
a
note
he
felt
satisfied
with
his
defence
and
advanced
toward
the
lake
it
was
small
but
deep
and
so
clear
and
tranquil
that
the
eye
could
penetrate
to
the
bottom
he
had
no
sooner
arrived
upon
the
banks
than
the
waters
were
seen
to
gurgle
and
the
siren
rising
midway
out
of
the
pool
sung
so
sweetly
that
birds
and
beasts
came
trooping
to
the
to
listen
of
this
orlando
heard
nothing
but
feigning
to
yield
to
the
charm
sank
down
upon
the
bank
the
siren
issued
from
the
water
with
the
intent
to
accomplish
his
destruction
orlando
seized
her
by
the
hair
and
while
she
sang
yet
louder
song
being
her
only
defence
cut
off
her
head
then
following
the
directions
of
the
book
he
stained
himself
all
over
with
her
blood
guarded
by
this
talisman
he
met
successively
all
the
monsters
set
for
defence
of
the
enchantress
and
her
garden
and
at
length
found
himself
again
at
the
spot
where
he
had
made
captive
the
enchantress
who
still
continued
fastened
to
the
beech
but
the
scene
was
changed
the
garden
had
disappeared
and
falerina
before
so
haughty
now
begged
for
mercy
assuring
him
that
many
lives
depended
upon
the
preservation
of
hers
orlando
promised
her
life
upon
her
pledging
herself
for
the
deliverance
of
her
captives
this
however
was
no
easy
task
they
were
not
in
her
possession
but
in
that
of
a
much
more
powerful
enchantress
morgana
the
lady
of
the
lake
the
very
idea
of
opposing
whom
made
falerina
turn
pale
with
fear
representing
to
him
the
hazards
of
the
enterprise
she
led
him
towards
the
dwelling
of
morgana
to
approach
it
he
had
to
encounter
the
same
uncourteous
who
had
already
defeated
and
made
captive
so
many
knights
and
last
of
all
rinaldo
he
was
a
churl
of
the
most
ferocious
character
named
arridano
morgana
had
provided
him
with
impenetrable
armor
and
endowed
him
in
such
a
manner
that
his
strength
always
increased
in
proportion
to
that
of
the
adversary
with
whom
he
was
matched
no
one
had
ever
yet
escaped
from
the
contest
since
such
was
his
power
of
endurance
he
could
breathe
freely
under
water
hence
having
grappled
with
a
knight
and
sunk
with
him
to
the
bottom
of
the
lake
he
returned
bearing
his
enemy
arms
in
triumph
to
the
surface
while
falerina
was
repeating
her
cautions
and
her
counsels
orlando
saw
rinaldo
arms
erected
in
form
of
a
trophy
among
other
spoils
made
by
the
villain
and
forgetting
their
late
quarrel
determined
upon
revenging
his
friend
arriving
at
the
pass
the
churl
presuming
to
bar
the
way
a
desperate
contest
ensued
during
which
falerina
escaped
the
churl
finding
himself
overmatched
at
a
contest
of
arms
resorted
to
his
peculiar
art
grappled
his
antagonist
and
plunged
with
him
into
the
lake
when
he
reached
the
bottom
orlando
found
himself
in
another
world
upon
a
dry
meadow
with
the
lake
overhead
through
which
shone
the
beams
of
our
sun
while
the
water
stood
on
all
sides
like
a
crystal
wall
here
the
battle
was
renewed
and
orlando
had
in
his
magic
sword
an
advantage
which
none
had
hitherto
possessed
it
had
been
tempered
by
falerina
so
that
no
spells
could
avail
against
it
thus
armed
and
countervailing
the
strength
of
his
adversary
by
his
superior
skill
and
activity
it
was
not
long
before
he
laid
him
dead
upon
the
field
orlando
then
made
all
haste
to
return
to
the
upper
air
and
passing
through
the
water
which
opened
a
way
before
him
such
was
the
power
of
the
magic
sword
he
soon
regained
the
shore
and
found
himself
in
a
field
as
thickly
covered
with
precious
stones
as
the
sky
is
with
stars
orlando
crossed
the
field
not
tempted
to
delay
his
enterprise
by
gathering
any
of
the
brilliant
gems
spread
all
around
him
he
next
passed
into
a
flowery
meadow
planted
with
trees
covered
with
fruit
and
flowers
and
full
of
all
imaginable
delights
in
the
middle
of
this
meadow
was
a
fountain
and
fast
by
it
lay
morgana
asleep
a
lady
of
a
lovely
aspect
dressed
in
white
and
vermilion
garments
her
forehead
well
furnished
with
hair
while
she
had
scarcely
any
behind
while
orlando
stood
in
silence
contemplating
her
beauty
he
heard
a
voice
exclaim
seize
the
fairy
by
the
forelock
if
thou
hopest
fair
success
but
his
attention
was
arrested
by
another
object
and
he
heeded
not
the
warning
he
saw
on
a
sudden
an
array
of
towers
pinnacles
and
columns
palaces
with
balconies
and
windows
extended
alleys
with
trees
in
short
a
scene
of
architectural
magnificence
surpassing
all
he
had
ever
beheld
while
he
stood
gazing
in
silent
astonishment
the
scene
slowly
melted
away
and
disappeared
footnote
this
is
a
poetical
description
of
a
phenomenon
which
is
said
to
be
really
exhibited
in
the
strait
of
messina
between
sicily
and
calabria
it
is
called
fata
morgana
or
mirage
when
he
had
recovered
from
his
amazement
he
looked
again
toward
the
fountain
the
fairy
had
awaked
and
risen
and
was
dancing
round
its
border
with
the
lightness
of
a
leaf
timing
her
footsteps
to
this
song
who
in
this
world
would
wealth

the
fairy
having
sung
thus
bounded
off
and
fled
from
the
flowery
meadow
over
a
high
and
inaccessible
mountain
orlando
pursued
her
through
thorns
and
rocks
while
the
sky
gradually
became
overcast
and
at
last
he
was
assailed
by
tempest
lightning
and
hail
while
he
thus
pursued
a
pale
and
meagre
woman
issued
from
a
cave
armed
with
a
whip
and
treading
close
upon
his
steps
scourged
him
with
vigorous
strokes
her
name
was
repentance
and
she
told
him
it
was
her
office
to
punish
those
who
neglected
to
obey
the
voice
of
prudence
and
seize
the
fairy
fortune
when
he
might
orlando
furious
at
this
chastisement
turned
upon
his
tormentor
but
might
as
well
have
stricken
the
wind
finding
it
useless
to
resist
he
resumed
his
chase
of
the
fairy
gained
upon
her
and
made
frequent
snatches
at
her
white
and
vermilion
garments
which
still
eluded
his
grasp
at
last
on
her
turning
her
head
for
an
instant
he
profited
by
the
chance
and
seized
her
by
the
forelock
in
an
instant
the
tempest
ceased
the
sky
became
serene
and
repentance
retreated
to
her
cave
orlando
now
demanded
of
morgana
the
keys
of
her
prison
and
the
fairy
feigning
a
complacent
aspect
delivered
up
a
key
of
silver
bidding
him
to
be
cautious
in
the
use
of
it
since
to
break
the
lock
would
be
to
involve
himself
and
all
in
inevitable
destruction
a
caution
which
gave
the
count
room
for
long
meditation
and
led
him
to
consider
how
few
amid
the
suitors
who
importune
the
dame
know
how
to
turn
the
keys
of
fortune
keeping
the
fairy
still
fast
by
the
forelock
orlando
proceeded
toward
the
prison
turned
the
key
without
occasioning
the
mischiefs
apprehended
and
delivered
the
prisoners
among
these
were
florismart
rinaldo
and
many
others
of
the
bravest
knights
of
france
morgana
had
disappeared
and
the
knights
under
the
guidance
of
orlando
retraced
the
path
by
which
he
had
come
they
soon
reached
the
field
of
treasure
rinaldo
finding
himself
amidst
this
mass
of
wealth
remembered
his
needy
garrison
of
montalban
and
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
seizing
part
of
the
booty
in
particular
a
golden
chain
studded
with
diamonds
was
too
much
for
his
and
he
took
it
and
was
bearing
it
off
notwithstanding
the
remonstrances
of
orlando
when
a
violent
wind
caught
him
and
whirled
him
back
as
he
approached
the
gate
this
happened
a
second
and
a
third
time
and
rinaldo
at
length
yielded
to
necessity
rather
than
to
the
entreaties
of
his
friends
and
cast
away
his
prize
they
soon
reached
the
bridge
and
passed
over
without
hindrance
to
the
other
side
where
they
found
the
trophy
decorated
with
their
arms
here
each
knight
resumed
his
own
and
all
except
the
paladins
and
their
friends
separated
as
their
inclinations
or
duty
prompted
dudon
the
dane
one
of
the
rescued
knights
informed
the
cousins
that
he
had
been
made
prisoner
by
morgana
while
in
the
discharge
of
an
embassy
to
them
from
charlemagne
who
called
upon
them
to
return
to
the
defence
of
christendom
orlando
was
too
much
fascinated
by
angelica
to
obey
this
summons
and
followed
by
the
faithful
florismart
who
would
not
leave
him
returned
towards
albracca
rinaldo
dudon
iroldo
prasildo
and
the
others
took
their
way
toward
the
west
the
invasion
of
france
agramant
king
of
africa
convoked
the
kings
his
vassals
to
deliberate
in
council
he
reminded
them
of
the
injuries
he
had
sustained
from
france
that
his
father
had
fallen
in
battle
with
charlemagne
and
that
his
early
years
had
hitherto
not
allowed
him
to
wipe
out
the
stain
of
former
defeats
he
now
proposed
to
them
to
carry
war
into
france
sobrino
his
wisest
councillor
opposed
the
project
representing
the
rashness
of
it
but
rodomont
the
young
and
fiery
king
of
algiers
denounced
sobrino
counsel
as
base
and
cowardly
declaring
himself
impatient
for
the
enterprise
the
king
of
the
garamantes
venerable
for
his
age
and
renowned
for
his
prophetic
lore
interposed
and
assured
the
king
that
such
an
attempt
would
be
sure
to
fail
unless
he
could
first
get
on
his
side
a
youth
marked
out
by
destiny
as
the
fitting
compeer
of
the
most
puissant
knights
of
france
the
young
rogero
descended
in
direct
line
from
hector
of
troy
this
prince
was
now
a
dweller
upon
the
mountain
carena
where
atlantes
his
a
powerful
magician
kept
him
in
retirement
having
discovered
by
his
art
that
his
pupil
would
be
lost
to
him
if
allowed
to
mingle
with
the
world
to
break
the
spells
of
atlantes
and
draw
rogero
from
his
retirement
one
only
means
was
to
be
found
it
was
a
ring
possessed
by
angelica
princess
of
cathay
which
was
a
talisman
against
all
enchantments
if
this
ring
could
be
procured
all
would
go
well
without
it
the
enterprise
was
desperate
rodomont
treated
this
declaration
of
the
old
prophet
with
scorn
and
it
would
probably
have
been
held
of
little
weight
by
the
council
had
not
the
aged
king
oppressed
by
the
weight
of
years
expired
in
the
very
act
of
reaffirming
his
prediction
this
made
so
deep
an
impression
on
the
council
that
it
was
unanimously
resolved
to
postpone
the
war
until
an
effort
should
be
made
to
win
rogero
to
the
camp
king
agramant
thereupon
proclaimed
that
the
sovereignty
of
a
kingdom
should
be
the
reward
of
whoever
should
succeed
in
obtaining
the
ring
of
angelica
brunello
the
dwarf
the
subtlest
thief
in
all
africa
undertook
to
procure
it
in
prosecution
of
this
design
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
angelica
kingdom
and
arrived
beneath
the
walls
of
albracca
while
the
besieging
army
was
encamped
before
the
fortress
while
the
attention
of
the
garrison
was
absorbed
by
the
battle
that
raged
below
he
scaled
the
walls
approached
the
princess
unnoticed
slipped
the
ring
from
her
finger
and
escaped
unobserved
he
hastened
to
the
seaside
and
finding
a
vessel
ready
to
sail
embarked
and
arrived
at
biserta
in
africa
here
he
found
agramant
impatient
for
the
talisman
which
was
to
foil
the
enchantments
of
atlantes
and
to
put
rogero
into
his
hands
the
dwarf
kneeling
before
the
king
presented
him
with
the
ring
and
agramant
delighted
at
the
success
of
his
mission
crowned
him
in
recompense
king
of
tingitana
all
were
now
anxious
to
go
in
quest
of
rogero
the
cavalcade
accordingly
departed
and
in
due
time
arrived
at
the
mountain
of
carena
at
the
bottom
of
this
was
a
fruitful
and
plain
watered
by
a
large
river
and
from
this
plain
was
descried
a
beautiful
garden
on
the
which
contained
the
mansion
of
atlantes
but
the
ring
which
discovered
what
was
before
invisible
could
not
though
it
revealed
this
paradise
enable
agramant
or
his
followers
to
enter
it
so
steep
and
smooth
was
the
rock
by
nature
that
even
brunello
failed
in
every
attempt
to
scale
it
he
did
not
for
this
despair
of
accomplishing
the
object
but
having
obtained
agramant
consent
caused
the
assembled
courtiers
and
knights
to
celebrate
a
tournament
upon
the
plain
below
this
was
done
with
the
view
of
seducing
rogero
from
his
fastness
and
the
stratagem
was
attended
with
success
rogero
joined
the
tourney
and
was
presented
by
agramant
with
a
splendid
horse
frontino
and
a
magnificent
sword
having
learned
from
agramant
his
intended
invasion
of
france
he
gladly
consented
to
join
the
expedition
rodomont
meanwhile
was
too
impatient
to
wait
for
arrangements
and
embarked
with
all
the
forces
he
could
raise
made
good
his
landing
on
the
coast
of
france
and
routed
the
christians
in
several
encounters
previously
to
this
however
gano
or
ganelon
as
he
is
sometimes
called
the
traitor
enemy
of
orlando
and
the
other
nephews
of
charlemagne
had
entered
into
a
traitorous
correspondence
with
marsilius
the
saracen
king
of
spain
whom
he
invited
into
france
marsilius
thus
encouraged
led
an
army
across
the
frontiers
and
joined
rodomont
this
was
the
situation
of
things
when
rinaldo
and
the
other
knights
who
had
obeyed
the
summons
of
dudon
set
forward
on
their
return
to
france
when
they
arrived
at
buda
in
hungary
they
found
the
king
of
that
country
about
despatching
his
son
ottachiero
with
an
army
to
the
succor
of
charlemagne
delighted
with
the
arrival
of
rinaldo
he
placed
his
son
and
troops
under
his
command
in
due
time
the
army
arrived
on
the
frontiers
of
france
and
united
with
the
troops
of
desiderius
king
of
lombardy
poured
down
into
provence
the
confederate
armies
had
not
marched
many
days
through
this
gay
tract
before
they
heard
a
crash
of
drums
and
trumpets
behind
the
hills
which
spoke
the
conflict
between
the
paynims
led
by
rodomont
and
the
christian
forces
rinaldo
witnessing
from
a
mountain
the
prowess
of
rodomont
left
his
troops
in
charge
of
his
friends
and
galloped
towards
him
with
his
lance
in
rest
the
impulse
was
irresistible
and
rodomont
was
unhorsed
but
rinaldo
unwilling
to
avail
himself
of
his
advantage
galloped
back
to
the
hill
and
having
secured
bayard
among
the
baggage
returned
to
finish
the
combat
on
foot
during
this
interval
the
battle
had
become
general
the
hungarians
were
routed
and
rinaldo
on
his
return
had
the
mortification
to
find
that
ottachiero
was
wounded
and
dudon
taken
prisoner
while
he
sought
rodomont
in
order
to
renew
the
combat
a
new
sound
of
drums
and
trumpets
was
heard
and
charlemagne
with
the
main
body
of
his
army
was
descried
advancing
in
battle
array
rodomont
seeing
this
mounted
the
horse
of
dudon
left
rinaldo
who
was
on
foot
and
galloped
off
to
encounter
this
new
enemy
agramant
accompanied
by
rogero
had
by
this
time
made
good
his
landing
and
joined
rodomont
with
all
his
forces
rogero
eagerly
embraced
this
first
opportunity
of
distinguishing
himself
and
spread
terror
wherever
he
went
encountering
in
turn
and
overthrowing
many
of
the
bravest
knights
of
france
at
length
he
found
himself
opposite
to
rinaldo
who
being
interrupted
as
we
have
said
in
his
combat
with
rodomont
and
unable
to
follow
him
being
on
foot
was
shouting
to
his
late
foe
to
return
and
finish
their
combat
rogero
also
was
on
foot
and
seeing
the
christian
knight
so
eager
for
a
contest
proffered
himself
to
supply
the
place
of
his
late
antagonist
rinaldo
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
moorish
prince
was
a
champion
worthy
of
his
arm
and
gladly
accepted
the
defiance
the
combat
was
stoutly
maintained
for
a
time
but
now
fortune
declared
decisively
in
favor
of
the
infidel
army
and
charlemagne
forces
gave
way
at
all
points
in
irreparable
confusion
the
two
combatants
were
separated
by
the
crowd
of
fugitives
and
pursuers
and
rinaldo
hastened
to
recover
possession
of
his
horse
but
bayard
in
the
confusion
had
got
loose
and
rinaldo
followed
him
into
a
thick
wood
thus
becoming
effectually
separated
from
rogero
rogero
also
seeking
his
horse
in
the
medley
came
where
two
warriors
were
engaged
in
mortal
combat
though
he
knew
not
who
they
were
he
could
distinguish
that
one
was
a
paynim
and
the
other
a
christian
and
moved
by
the
spirit
of
courtesy
he
approached
them
and
exclaimed
let
him
of
the
two
who
worships
christ
pause
and
hear
what
i
have
to
say
the
army
of
charles
is
routed
and
in
flight
so
that
if
he
wishes
to
follow
his
leader
he
has
no
time
for
delay
the
christian
knight
who
was
none
other
than
bradamante
a
female
warrior
in
prowess
equal
to
the
best
of
knights
was
thunderstruck
with
the
tidings
and
would
gladly
leave
the
contest
undecided
and
retire
from
the
field
but
rodomont
her
antagonist
would
by
no
means
consent
rogero
indignant
at
his
discourtesy
insisted
upon
her
departure
while
he
took
up
her
quarrel
with
rodomont
the
combat
obstinately
maintained
on
both
sides
was
interrupted
by
the
return
of
bradamante
finding
herself
unable
to
overtake
the
fugitives
and
reluctant
to
leave
to
another
the
burden
and
risk
of
a
contest
which
belonged
to
herself
she
had
returned
to
reclaim
the
combat
she
arrived
however
when
her
champion
had
dealt
his
enemy
such
a
blow
as
obliged
him
to
drop
both
his
sword
and
bridle
rogero
disdaining
to
profit
by
his
adversary
defenceless
situation
sat
apart
upon
his
horse
while
that
of
rodomont
bore
his
rider
stunned
and
stupefied
about
the
field
bradamante
approached
rogero
conceiving
a
yet
higher
opinion
of
his
valor
on
beholding
such
an
instance
of
forbearance
she
addressed
him
excusing
herself
for
leaving
him
exposed
to
an
enemy
from
his
interference
in
her
cause
pleading
her
duty
to
her
sovereign
as
the
motive
while
she
spoke
rodomont
recovered
from
his
confusion
rode
up
to
them
his
bearing
was
however
changed
and
he
disclaimed
all
thoughts
of
further
contest
with
one
who
he
said
had
already
conquered
him
by
his
courtesy
so
saying
he
quitted
his
antagonist
picked
up
his
sword
and
spurred
out
of
sight
bradamante
was
now
again
desirous
of
retiring
from
the
field
and
rogero
insisted
on
accompanying
her
though
yet
unaware
of
her
sex
as
they
pursued
their
way
she
inquired
the
name
and
quality
of
her
new
associate
and
rogero
informed
her
of
his
nation
and
family
he
told
her
that
astyanax
the
son
of
hector
of
troy
established
the
kingdom
of
messina
in
sicily
from
him
were
derived
two
branches
which
gave
origin
to
two
families
of
renown
from
one
sprang
the
royal
race
of
pepin
and
charlemagne
and
from
the
other
that
of
reggio
in
italy
from
that
of
reggio
am
i
derived
he
continued
my
mother
driven
from
her
home
by
the
chance
of
war
died
in
giving
me
life
and
i
was
taken
in
charge
by
a
sage
enchanter
who
trained
me
to
feats
of
arms
amidst
the
dangers
of
the
desert
and
the
chase
having
thus
ended
his
tale
rogero
entreated
a
similar
return
of
courtesy
from
his
companion
who
replied
without
disguise
that
she
was
of
the
race
of
clermont
and
sister
to
rinaldo
whose
fame
was
perhaps
known
to
him
rogero
much
moved
by
this
intelligence
entreated
her
to
take
off
her
helmet
and
at
the
discovery
of
her
face
remained
transported
with
delight
while
absorbed
in
this
contemplation
an
unexpected
danger
assailed
them
a
party
which
was
placed
in
a
wood
in
order
to
intercept
the
retreating
christians
broke
from
its
ambush
upon
the
pair
and
bradamante
who
was
uncasqued
was
wounded
in
the
head
rogero
was
in
a
fury
at
this
attack
and
bradamante
replacing
her
helmet
joined
him
in
taking
speedy
vengeance
on
their
enemies
they
cleared
the
field
of
them
but
became
separated
in
the
pursuit
and
rogero
quitting
the
chase
wandered
by
hill
and
vale
in
search
of
her
whom
he
had
no
sooner
found
than
lost
while
pursuing
this
quest
he
fell
in
with
two
knights
whom
he
joined
and
engaged
them
to
assist
him
in
the
search
of
his
companion
describing
her
arms
but
concealing
from
a
certain
feeling
of
jealousy
her
quality
and
sex
it
was
evening
when
they
joined
company
and
having
ridden
together
through
the
night
the
morning
was
beginning
to
break
when
one
of
the
strangers
fixing
his
eyes
upon
rogero
shield
demanded
of
him
by
what
right
he
bore
the
trojan
arms
rogero
declared
his
origin
and
race
and
then
in
his
turn
interrogated
the
inquirer
as
to
his
pretensions
to
the
cognizance
of
hector
which
he
bore
the
stranger
replied
my
name
is
mandricardo
son
of
agrican
the
tartar
king
whom
orlando
treacherously
slew
i
say
treacherously
for
in
fair
fight
he
could
not
have
done
it
it
is
in
search
of
him
that
i
have
come
to
france
to
take
vengeance
for
my
father
and
to
wrest
from
him
durindana
that
famous
sword
which
belongs
to
me
and
not
to
him
when
the
knights
demanded
to
know
by
what
right
he
claimed
durindana
mandricardo
thus
related
his
history
i
had
been
before
the
death
of
my
father
a
wild
and
reckless
youth
that
event
awakened
my
energies
and
drove
me
forth
to
seek
for
vengeance
determined
to
owe
success
to
nothing
but
my
own
exertions
i
departed
without
attendants
or
horse
or
arms
travelling
thus
alone
and
on
foot
i
espied
one
day
a
pavilion
pitched
near
a
fountain
and
entered
it
intent
on
adventure
i
found
therein
a
damsel
of
gracious
aspect
who
replied
to
my
inquiries
that
the
fountain
was
the
work
of
a
fairy
whose
castle
stood
beyond
a
neighboring
hill
where
she
kept
watch
over
a
treasure
which
many
knights
had
tried
to
win
but
fruitlessly
having
lost
their
life
or
liberty
in
the
attempt
this
treasure
was
the
armor
of
hector
prince
of
troy
whom
achilles
treacherously
slew
nothing
was
wanting
but
his
sword
durindana
and
this
had
fallen
into
the
possession
of
a
queen
named
penthesilea
from
whom
it
passed
through
her
descendants
to
almontes
whom
orlando
slew
and
thus
became
possessed
of
the
sword
the
rest
of
hector
arms
were
saved
and
carried
off
by
aeneas
from
whom
this
fairy
received
them
in
recompense
of
service
rendered
you
have
the
courage
to
attempt
their
acquisition
said
the
damsel
will
be
your
guide
mandricardo
went
on
to
say
that
he
eagerly
embraced
the
proposal
and
being
provided
with
horse
and
armor
by
the
damsel
set
forth
on
his
enterprise
the
lady
accompanying
him
as
they
rode
she
explained
the
dangers
of
the
quest
the
armor
was
defended
by
a
champion
one
of
the
numerous
unsuccessful
adventurers
for
the
prize
all
of
whom
had
been
made
prisoners
by
the
fairy
and
compelled
to
take
their
turn
day
by
day
in
defending
the
arms
against
all
comers
thus
speaking
they
arrived
at
the
castle
which
was
of
alabaster
overlaid
with
gold
before
it
on
a
lawn
sat
an
armed
knight
on
horseback
who
was
none
other
than
gradasso
king
of
sericane
who
in
his
return
home
from
his
unsuccessful
inroad
into
france
had
fallen
into
the
power
of
the
fairy
and
was
held
to
do
her
bidding
mandricardo
upon
seeing
him
dropt
his
visor
and
laid
his
lance
in
rest
the
champion
of
the
castle
was
equally
ready
and
each
spurred
towards
his
opponent
they
met
one
another
with
equal
force
splintered
their
spears
and
returning
to
the
charge
encountered
with
their
swords
the
contest
was
long
and
doubtful
when
mandricardo
determined
to
bring
it
to
an
end
threw
his
arms
about
gradasso
grappled
with
him
and
both
fell
to
the
ground
mandricardo
however
fell
uppermost
and
preserving
his
advantage
compelled
gradasso
to
yield
himself
conquered
the
damsel
now
interfered
congratulating
the
victor
and
consoling
the
vanquished
as
well
as
she
might
mandricardo
and
the
damsel
proceeded
to
the
gate
of
the
castle
which
they
found
undefended
as
they
entered
they
beheld
a
shield
suspended
from
a
pilaster
of
gold
the
device
was
a
white
eagle
on
an
azure
field
in
memory
of
the
bird
of
jove
which
bore
away
ganymede
the
flower
of
the
phrygian
race
beneath
was
engraved
the
following
couplet
let
none
with
hand
profane
my
buckler
wrong
unless
he
be
himself
as
hector
strong
the
damsel
alighting
from
her
palfrey
made
obeisance
to
the
arms
bending
herself
to
the
ground
the
tartar
king
bowed
his
head
with
equal
reverence
then
advancing
towards
the
shield
touched
it
with
his
sword
thereupon
an
earthquake
shook
the
ground
and
the
way
by
which
he
had
entered
closed
another
and
an
opposite
gate
opened
and
displayed
a
field
bristling
with
stalks
and
grain
of
gold
the
damsel
upon
this
told
him
that
he
had
no
means
of
retreat
but
by
cutting
down
the
harvest
which
was
before
him
and
by
uprooting
a
tree
which
grew
in
the
middle
of
the
field
mandricardo
without
replying
began
to
mow
the
harvest
with
his
sword
but
had
scarce
smitten
thrice
when
he
perceived
that
every
stalk
that
fell
was
instantly
transformed
into
some
poisonous
or
ravenous
animal
which
prepared
to
assail
him
instructed
by
the
damsel
he
snatched
up
a
stone
and
cast
it
among
the
pack
a
strange
wonder
followed
for
no
sooner
had
the
stone
fallen
among
the
beasts
than
they
turned
their
rage
against
one
another
and
rent
each
other
to
pieces
mandricardo
did
not
stop
to
marvel
at
the
miracle
but
proceeded
to
fulfil
his
task
and
uproot
the
tree
he
clasped
it
round
the
trunk
and
made
vigorous
efforts
to
tear
it
up
by
the
roots
at
each
effort
fell
a
shower
of
leaves
that
were
instantly
changed
into
birds
of
prey
which
attacked
the
knight
flapping
their
wings
in
his
face
with
horrid
screeching
but
undismayed
by
this
new
annoyance
he
continued
to
tug
at
the
trunk
till
it
yielded
to
his
efforts
a
burst
of
wind
and
thunder
followed
and
the
hawks
and
vultures
flew
screaming
away
but
these
only
gave
place
to
a
new
foe
for
from
the
hole
made
by
tearing
up
the
tree
issued
a
furious
serpent
and
darting
at
mandricardo
wound
herself
about
his
limbs
with
a
strain
that
almost
crushed
him
fortune
however
again
stood
his
friend
for
writhing
under
the
folds
of
the
monster
he
fell
backwards
into
the
hole
and
his
enemy
was
crushed
beneath
his
weight
mandricardo
when
he
was
somewhat
recovered
and
assured
himself
of
the
destruction
of
the
serpent
began
to
contemplate
the
place
into
which
he
had
fallen
and
saw
that
he
was
in
a
vault
incrusted
with
costly
metals
and
illuminated
by
a
live
coal
in
the
middle
was
a
sort
of
ivory
bier
and
upon
this
was
extended
what
appeared
to
be
a
knight
in
armor
but
was
in
truth
an
empty
trophy
composed
of
the
rich
and
precious
arms
once
hector
to
which
nothing
was
wanting
but
the
sword
while
mandricardo
stood
contemplating
the
prize
a
door
opened
behind
him
and
a
bevy
of
fair
damsels
entered
dancing
who
taking
up
the
armor
piece
by
piece
led
him
away
to
the
place
where
the
shield
was
suspended
where
he
found
the
fairy
of
the
castle
seated
in
state
by
her
he
was
invested
with
the
arms
he
had
won
first
pledging
his
solemn
oath
to
wear
no
other
blade
but
durindana
which
he
was
to
wrest
from
orlando
and
thus
complete
the
conquest
of
hector
arms
the
invasion
of
france
continued
mandricardo
having
completed
his
story
now
turned
to
rogero
and
proposed
that
arms
should
decide
which
of
the
two
was
most
worthy
to
bear
the
symbol
of
the
trojan
knight
rogero
felt
no
other
objection
to
this
proposal
than
the
scruple
which
arose
on
observing
that
his
antagonist
was
without
a
sword
mandricardo
insisted
that
this
need
be
no
impediment
since
his
oath
prevented
him
from
using
a
sword
until
he
should
have
achieved
the
conquest
of
durindana
this
was
no
sooner
said
than
a
new
antagonist
started
up
in
gradasso
who
now
accompanied
mandricardo
gradasso
vindicated
his
prior
right
to
durindana
to
obtain
which
he
had
embarked
as
was
related
in
the
beginning
in
that
bold
inroad
upon
france
a
quarrel
was
thus
kindled
between
the
kings
of
tartary
and
sericane
while
the
dispute
was
raging
a
knight
arrived
upon
the
ground
accompanied
by
a
damsel
to
whom
rogero
related
the
cause
of
the
strife
the
knight
was
florismart
and
his
companion
flordelis
florismart
succeeded
in
bringing
the
two
champions
to
accord
by
informing
them
that
he
could
bring
them
to
the
presence
of
orlando
the
master
of
durindana
gradasso
and
mandricardo
readily
made
truce
in
order
to
accompany
florismart
nor
would
rogero
be
left
behind
as
they
proceeded
on
their
quest
they
were
met
by
a
dwarf
who
entreated
their
assistance
in
behalf
of
his
lady
who
had
been
carried
off
by
an
enchanter
mounted
on
a
winged
horse
however
unwilling
to
leave
the
question
of
the
sword
undecided
it
was
not
possible
for
the
knights
to
resist
this
appeal
two
of
their
number
gradasso
and
rogero
therefore
accompanied
the
dwarf
mandricardo
persisted
in
his
search
for
orlando
and
florismart
with
flordelis
pursued
their
way
to
the
camp
of
charlemagne
atlantes
the
enchanter
who
had
brought
up
rogero
and
cherished
for
him
the
warmest
affection
knew
by
his
art
that
his
pupil
was
destined
to
be
severed
from
him
and
converted
to
the
christian
faith
through
the
influence
of
bradamante
that
royal
maiden
with
whom
chance
had
brought
him
acquainted
thinking
to
thwart
the
will
of
heaven
in
this
respect
he
now
put
forth
all
his
arts
to
entrap
rogero
into
his
power
by
the
aid
of
his
subservient
demons
he
reared
a
castle
on
an
inaccessible
height
in
the
pyrenean
mountains
and
to
make
it
a
pleasant
abode
to
his
pupil
contrived
to
entrap
and
convey
thither
knights
and
damsels
many
a
one
whom
chance
had
brought
into
the
vicinity
of
his
castle
here
in
a
sort
of
sensual
paradise
they
were
but
too
willing
to
forget
glory
and
duty
and
to
pass
their
time
in
indolent
enjoyment
it
was
by
the
enchanter
that
the
dwarf
had
now
been
sent
to
tempt
the
knights
into
his
power
but
we
must
now
return
to
rinaldo
whom
we
left
interrupted
in
his
combat
with
rodomont
in
search
of
his
late
antagonist
and
intent
on
bringing
their
combat
to
a
decision
he
entered
the
forest
of
arden
whither
he
suspected
rodomont
had
gone
while
engaged
on
this
quest
he
was
surprised
by
the
vision
of
a
beautiful
child
dancing
naked
with
three
damsels
as
beautiful
as
himself
while
he
was
lost
in
admiration
at
the
sight
the
child
approached
him
and
throwing
at
him
handfuls
of
roses
and
lilies
struck
him
from
his
horse
he
was
no
sooner
down
than
he
was
seized
by
the
dancers
by
whom
he
was
dragged
about
and
scourged
with
flowers
till
he
fell
into
a
swoon
when
he
began
to
revive
one
of
the
group
approached
him
and
told
him
that
his
punishment
was
the
consequence
of
his
rebellion
against
that
power
before
whom
all
things
bend
that
there
was
but
one
remedy
to
heal
the
wounds
that
had
been
inflicted
and
that
was
to
drink
of
the
waters
of
love
then
they
left
him
rinaldo
sore
and
faint
dragged
himself
toward
a
fountain
which
flowed
near
by
and
being
parched
with
thirst
drank
greedily
and
almost
unconsciously
of
the
water
which
was
sweet
to
the
taste
but
bitter
to
the
heart
after
repeated
draughts
he
recovered
his
strength
and
recollection
and
found
himself
in
the
same
place
where
angelica
had
formerly
awakened
him
with
a
rain
of
flowers
and
whence
he
had
fled
in
contempt
of
her
courtesy
this
remembrance
of
the
scene
was
followed
by
the
recognition
of
his
crime
and
repenting
bitterly
his
ingratitude
he
leaped
upon
bayard
with
the
intention
of
hastening
to
angelica
country
and
soliciting
his
pardon
at
her
feet
let
us
now
retrace
our
steps
and
revert
to
the
time
when
the
paladins
having
learned
from
dudon
the
summons
of
charlemagne
to
return
to
france
to
repel
the
invaders
had
all
obeyed
the
command
with
the
exception
of
orlando
whose
passion
for
angelica
still
held
him
in
attendance
on
her
orlando
arriving
before
albracca
found
it
closely
beleaguered
he
however
made
his
way
into
the
citadel
and
related
his
adventures
to
angelica
from
the
time
of
his
departure
up
to
his
separation
from
rinaldo
and
the
rest
when
they
departed
to
the
assistance
of
charlemagne
angelica
in
return
described
the
distresses
of
the
garrison
and
the
force
of
the
besiegers
and
in
conclusion
prayed
orlando
to
favor
her
escape
from
the
pressing
danger
and
escort
her
into
france
orlando
who
did
not
suspect
that
love
for
rinaldo
was
her
secret
motive
joyfully
agreed
to
the
proposal
and
the
sally
was
resolved
upon
leaving
lights
burning
in
the
fortress
they
departed
at
nightfall
and
passed
in
safety
through
the
enemy
camp
after
encountering
numerous
adventures
they
reached
the
and
embarked
on
board
a
pinnace
for
france
the
vessel
arrived
safely
and
the
travellers
disembarking
in
provence
pursued
their
way
by
land
one
day
heated
and
weary
they
sought
shelter
from
the
sun
in
the
forest
of
arden
and
chance
directed
angelica
to
the
fountain
of
disdain
of
whose
waters
she
eagerly
drank
issuing
thence
the
count
and
damsel
encountered
a
it
was
no
other
than
rinaldo
who
was
just
on
the
point
of
setting
off
on
a
pilgrimage
in
search
of
angelica
to
implore
her
pardon
for
his
insensibility
and
urge
his
new
found
passion
surprise
and
delight
at
first
deprived
him
of
utterance
but
soon
recovering
himself
he
joyfully
saluted
her
claiming
her
as
his
and
exhorting
her
to
put
herself
under
his
protection
his
presumption
was
repelled
by
angelica
with
disdain
and
orlando
enraged
at
the
invasion
of
his
rights
challenged
him
to
decide
their
claims
by
arms
terrified
at
the
combat
which
ensued
angelica
fled
amain
through
the
forest
and
came
out
upon
a
plain
covered
with
tents
this
was
the
camp
of
charlemagne
who
led
the
army
of
reserve
destined
to
support
the
troops
which
had
advanced
to
oppose
marsilius
charles
having
heard
the
damsel
tale
with
difficulty
separated
the
two
cousins
and
then
consigned
angelica
as
the
cause
of
quarrel
to
the
care
of
namo
duke
of
bavaria
promising
that
she
should
be
his
who
should
best
deserve
her
in
the
impending
battle
but
these
plans
and
hopes
were
frustrated
the
christian
army
beaten
at
all
points
fled
from
the
saracens
and
angelica
indifferent
to
both
her
lovers
mounted
a
swift
palfrey
and
plunged
into
the
forest
rejoicing
in
spite
of
her
terror
at
having
regained
her
liberty
she
stopped
at
last
in
a
tufted
grove
where
a
gentle
zephyr
blew
and
whose
young
trees
were
watered
by
two
clear
runnels
which
came
and
mingled
their
waters
making
a
pleasing
murmur
believing
herself
far
from
rinaldo
and
overcome
by
fatigue
and
the
summer
heat
she
saw
with
delight
a
bank
covered
with
flowers
so
thick
that
they
almost
hid
the
green
turf
inviting
her
to
alight
and
rest
she
dismounted
from
her
palfrey
and
turned
him
loose
to
recruit
his
strength
with
the
tender
grass
which
bordered
the
streamlets
then
in
a
sheltered
nook
tapestried
with
moss
and
fenced
in
with
roses
and
she
yielded
herself
to
grateful
repose
she
had
not
slept
long
when
she
was
awakened
by
the
noise
made
by
the
approach
of
a
horse
starting
up
she
saw
an
armed
knight
who
had
arrived
at
the
bank
of
the
stream
not
knowing
whether
he
was
to
be
feared
or
not
her
heart
beat
with
anxiety
she
pressed
aside
the
leaves
to
allow
her
to
see
who
it
was
but
scarce
dared
to
breathe
for
fear
of
betraying
herself
soon
the
knight
threw
himself
on
the
flowery
bank
and
leaning
his
head
on
his
hand
fell
into
a
profound
reverie
then
arousing
himself
from
his
silence
he
began
to
pour
forth
complaints
mingled
with
deep
sighs
rivers
of
tears
flowed
down
his
cheeks
and
his
breast
seemed
to
labor
with
a
hidden
flame
ah
vain
regrets
he
exclaimed
cruel
fortune
others
triumph
while
i
endure
hopeless
misery
better
a
thousand
times
to
lose
life
than
wear
a
chain
so
disgraceful
and
so
oppressive
angelica
by
this
time
had
recognized
the
stranger
and
perceived
that
it
was
sacripant
king
of
circassia
one
of
the
worthiest
of
her
suitors
this
prince
had
followed
angelica
from
his
country
at
the
very
gates
of
the
day
to
france
where
he
heard
with
dismay
that
she
was
under
the
guardianship
of
the
paladin
orlando
and
that
the
emperor
had
announced
his
decree
to
award
her
as
the
prize
of
valor
to
that
one
of
his
nephews
who
should
best
deserve
her
as
sacripant
continued
to
lament
angelica
who
had
always
opposed
the
hardness
of
marble
to
his
sighs
thought
with
herself
that
nothing
forbade
her
employing
his
good
offices
in
this
unhappy
crisis
though
firmly
resolved
never
to
accept
him
as
a
spouse
she
yet
felt
the
necessity
of
giving
him
a
gleam
of
hope
in
reward
for
the
service
she
required
of
him
all
at
once
like
diana
she
stepped
forth
from
the
arbor
may
the
gods
preserve
thee
she
said
and
put
far
from
thee
all
hard
thoughts
of
me
then
she
told
him
all
that
had
befallen
her
since
she
parted
with
him
at
her
father
court
and
how
she
had
availed
herself
of
orlando
protection
to
escape
from
the
beleaguered
city
at
that
moment
the
noise
of
horse
and
armor
was
heard
as
of
one
approaching
and
sacripant
furious
at
the
interruption
resumed
his
helmet
mounted
his
horse
and
placed
his
lance
in
rest
he
saw
a
knight
advancing
with
scarf
and
plume
of
snowy
whiteness
sacripant
regarded
him
with
angry
eyes
and
while
he
was
yet
some
distance
off
defied
him
to
the
combat
the
other
not
moved
by
his
angry
tone
to
make
reply
put
himself
on
his
defence
their
horses
struck
at
the
same
moment
with
the
spur
rushed
upon
one
another
with
the
impetuosity
of
a
tempest
their
shields
were
pierced
each
with
the
other
lance
and
only
the
temper
of
their
breastplates
saved
their
lives
both
the
horses
recoiled
with
the
violence
of
the
shock
but
the
unknown
knight
recovered
itself
at
the
touch
of
the
spur
the
saracen
fell
dead
and
bore
down
his
master
with
him
the
white
knight
seeing
his
enemy
in
this
condition
cared
not
to
renew
the
combat
but
thinking
he
had
done
enough
for
glory
pursued
his
way
through
the
forest
and
was
a
mile
off
before
sacripant
had
got
free
from
his
horse
as
a
ploughman
stunned
by
a
which
has
stricken
dead
the
oxen
at
his
plough
stands
motionless
sadly
contemplating
his
loss
so
sacripant
stood
confounded
and
overwhelmed
with
mortification
at
having
angelica
a
witness
of
his
defeat
he
groaned
he
sighed
less
from
the
pain
of
his
bruises
than
for
the
shame
of
being
reduced
to
such
a
state
before
her
the
princess
took
pity
on
him
and
consoled
him
as
well
as
she
could
banish
your
regrets
my
lord
she
said
this
accident
has
happened
solely
in
consequence
of
the
feebleness
of
your
horse
which
had
more
need
of
rest
and
food
than
of
such
an
encounter
as
this
nor
can
your
adversary
gain
any
credit
by
it
since
he
has
hurried
away
not
venturing
a
second
trial
while
she
thus
consoled
sacripant
they
perceived
a
person
approach
who
seemed
a
courier
with
bag
and
horn
as
soon
as
he
came
up
he
accosted
sacripant
and
inquired
if
he
had
seen
a
knight
pass
that
way
bearing
a
white
shield
and
with
a
white
plume
to
his
helmet
i
have
indeed
seen
too
much
of
him
said
sacripant
it
is
he
who
has
brought
me
to
the
ground
but
at
least
i
hope
to
learn
from
you
who
that
knight
is
that
i
can
easily
inform
you
said
the
man
know
then
that
if
you
have
been
overthrown
you
owe
your
fate
to
the
high
prowess
of
a
lady
as
beautiful
as
she
is
brave
it
is
the
fair
and
illustrious
bradamante
who
has
won
from
you
the
honors
of
victory
at
these
words
the
courier
rode
on
his
way
leaving
sacripant
more
confounded
and
mortified
than
ever
in
silence
he
mounted
the
horse
of
angelica
taking
the
lady
behind
him
on
the
croup
and
rode
away
in
search
of
a
more
secure
asylum
hardly
had
they
ridden
two
miles
when
a
new
sound
was
heard
in
the
forest
and
they
perceived
a
gallant
and
powerful
horse
which
leaping
the
ravines
and
dashing
aside
the
branches
that
opposed
his
passage
appeared
before
them
accoutred
with
a
rich
harness
adorned
with
gold
if
i
may
believe
my
eyes
which
penetrate
with
difficulty
the
underwood
said
angelica
that
horse
that
dashes
so
stoutly
through
the
bushes
is
bayard
and
i
marvel
how
he
seems
to
know
the
need
we
have
of
him
mounted
as
we
are
both
on
one
feeble
animal
sacripant
dismounting
from
the
palfrey
approached
the
fiery
courser
and
attempted
to
seize
his
bridle
but
the
disdainful
animal
turning
from
him
launched
at
him
a
volley
of
kicks
enough
to
have
shattered
a
wall
of
marble
bayard
then
approached
angelica
with
an
air
as
gentle
and
loving
as
a
faithful
dog
could
his
master
after
a
long
separation
for
he
remembered
how
she
had
caressed
him
and
even
fed
him
in
albracca
she
took
his
bridle
in
her
left
hand
while
with
her
right
she
patted
his
neck
the
beautiful
animal
gifted
with
wonderful
intelligence
seemed
to
submit
entirely
sacripant
seizing
the
moment
to
vault
upon
him
controlled
his
curvetings
and
angelica
quitting
the
croup
of
the
palfrey
regained
her
seat
but
turning
his
eyes
toward
a
place
where
was
heard
a
noise
of
arms
sacripant
beheld
rinaldo
that
hero
now
loves
angelica
more
than
his
life
and
she
flies
him
as
the
timid
crane
the
falcon
the
fountain
of
which
angelica
had
drunk
produced
such
an
effect
on
the
beautiful
queen
that
with
distressed
countenance
and
trembling
voice
she
conjured
sacripant
not
to
wait
the
approach
of
rinaldo
but
to
join
her
in
flight
am
i
then
said
sacripant
of
so
little
esteem
with
you
that
you
doubt
my
power
to
defend
you
do
you
forget
the
battle
of
albracca
and
how
in
your
defence
i
fought
against
agrican
and
all
his
knights
angelica
made
no
reply
uncertain
what
to
do
but
already
rinaldo
was
too
near
to
be
escaped
he
advanced
menacingly
to
the
circassian
king
for
he
recognized
his
horse
vile
thief
he
cried
dismount
from
that
horse
and
prevent
the
punishment
that
is
your
due
for
daring
to
rob
me
of
my
property
leave
also
the
princess
in
my
hands
for
it
would
indeed
be
a
sin
to
suffer
so
charming
a
lady
and
so
gallant
a
charger
to
remain
in
such
keeping
the
king
of
circassia
furious
at
being
thus
insulted
cried
out
thou
liest
villain
in
giving
me
the
name
of
thief
which
better
belongs
to
thyself
than
to
me
it
is
true
the
beauty
of
this
lady
and
the
perfection
of
this
horse
are
unequalled
come
on
then
and
let
us
try
which
of
us
is
most
worthy
to
possess
them
at
these
words
the
king
of
circassia
and
rinaldo
attacked
one
another
with
all
their
force
one
fighting
on
foot
the
other
on
horseback
you
need
not
however
suppose
that
the
saracen
king
found
any
advantage
in
this
for
a
young
page
unused
to
horsemanship
could
not
have
failed
more
completely
to
manage
bayard
than
did
this
accomplished
knight
the
faithful
animal
loved
his
master
too
well
to
injure
him
and
refused
his
aid
as
well
as
his
obedience
to
the
hand
of
sacripant
who
could
strike
but
ineffectual
blows
the
horse
backing
when
he
wished
him
to
go
forward
and
dropping
his
head
and
arching
his
back
throwing
out
with
his
legs
so
as
almost
to
shake
the
knight
out
of
the
saddle
sacripant
seeing
that
he
could
not
manage
him
watched
his
opportunity
rose
on
his
saddle
and
leapt
lightly
to
the
earth
then
relieved
from
the
embarrassment
of
the
horse
renewed
the
combat
on
more
equal
terms
their
skill
to
thrust
and
parry
were
equal
one
rises
the
other
stoops
with
one
foot
set
firm
they
turn
and
wind
to
lay
on
strokes
or
to
dodge
them
at
last
rinaldo
throwing
himself
on
the
circassian
dealt
him
a
blow
so
terrible
that
fusberta
his
good
sword
cut
in
two
the
buckler
of
sacripant
although
it
was
made
of
bone
and
covered
with
a
thick
plate
of
steel
well
tempered
the
arm
of
the
saracen
was
deprived
of
its
defence
and
almost
palsied
with
the
stroke
angelica
perceiving
how
victory
was
likely
to
incline
and
shuddering
at
the
thought
of
becoming
the
prize
of
rinaldo
hesitated
no
longer
turning
her
horse
head
she
fled
with
the
utmost
speed
and
in
spite
of
the
round
pebbles
which
covered
a
steep
descent
she
plunged
into
a
deep
valley
trembling
with
the
fear
that
rinaldo
was
in
pursuit
at
the
bottom
of
this
valley
she
encountered
an
aged
hermit
whose
white
beard
flowed
to
his
middle
and
whose
venerable
appearance
seemed
to
assure
his
piety
this
hermit
who
appeared
shrunk
by
age
and
fasting
travelled
slowly
mounted
upon
a
wretched
ass
the
princess
overcome
with
fear
conjured
him
to
save
her
life
and
to
conduct
her
to
some
port
of
the
sea
whence
she
might
embark
and
quit
france
never
more
to
hear
the
odious
name
of
rinaldo
the
old
hermit
was
something
of
a
wizard
he
comforted
angelica
and
promised
to
protect
her
from
all
peril
then
he
opened
his
scrip
and
took
from
thence
a
book
and
had
read
but
a
single
page
when
a
goblin
obedient
to
his
incantations
appeared
under
the
form
of
a
laboring
man
and
demanded
his
orders
he
received
them
transported
himself
to
the
place
where
the
knights
still
maintained
their
conflict
and
boldly
stepped
between
the
two
tell
me
i
pray
you
he
said
what
benefit
will
accrue
to
him
who
shall
get
the
better
in
this
contest
the
object
you
are
contending
for
is
already
disposed
of
for
the
paladin
orlando
without
effort
and
without
opposition
is
now
carrying
away
the
princess
angelica
to
paris
you
had
better
pursue
them
promptly
for
if
they
reach
paris
you
will
never
see
her
again
at
these
words
you
might
have
seen
those
rival
warriors
confounded
stupefied
silently
agreeing
that
they
were
affording
their
rival
a
fair
opportunity
to
triumph
over
them
rinaldo
approaching
bayard
breathes
a
sigh
of
shame
and
rage
and
swears
a
terrible
oath
that
if
he
overtakes
orlando
he
will
tear
his
heart
out
then
mounting
bayard
and
pressing
his
flanks
with
his
spurs
he
leaves
the
king
of
circassia
on
foot
in
the
forest
let
it
not
appear
strange
that
rinaldo
found
bayard
obedient
at
last
after
having
so
long
prevented
any
one
from
even
touching
his
bridle
for
that
fine
animal
had
an
intelligence
almost
human
he
had
fled
from
his
master
only
to
draw
him
on
the
track
of
angelica
and
enable
him
to
recover
her
he
saw
when
the
princess
fled
from
the
battle
and
rinaldo
being
then
engaged
in
a
fight
on
foot
bayard
found
himself
free
to
follow
the
traces
of
angelica
thus
he
had
drawn
his
master
after
him
not
permitting
him
to
approach
and
had
brought
him
to
the
sight
of
the
princess
but
bayard
now
deceived
like
his
master
with
the
false
intelligence
of
the
goblin
submits
to
be
mounted
and
to
serve
his
master
as
usual
and
rinaldo
animated
with
rage
makes
him
fly
toward
paris
more
slowly
than
his
wishes
though
the
speed
of
bayard
outstripped
the
winds
full
of
impatience
to
encounter
orlando
he
gave
but
a
few
hours
that
night
to
sleep
early
the
next
day
he
saw
before
him
the
great
city
under
the
walls
of
which
the
emperor
charles
had
collected
the
scattered
remains
of
his
army
foreseeing
that
he
would
soon
be
attacked
on
all
sides
the
emperor
had
caused
the
ancient
fortifications
to
be
repaired
and
new
ones
to
be
built
surrounded
by
wide
and
deep
ditches
the
desire
to
hold
the
field
against
the
enemy
made
him
seize
every
means
of
procuring
new
allies
he
hoped
to
receive
from
england
aid
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
form
a
new
camp
and
as
soon
as
rinaldo
rejoined
him
he
selected
him
to
go
as
his
ambassador
into
england
to
plead
for
auxiliaries
rinaldo
was
far
from
pleased
with
his
commission
but
he
obeyed
the
emperor
commands
without
giving
himself
time
to
devote
a
single
day
to
the
object
nearest
his
heart
he
hastened
to
calais
and
lost
not
a
moment
in
embarking
for
england
ardently
desiring
a
hasty
despatch
of
his
commission
and
a
speedy
return
to
france
bradamante
and
rogero
bradamante
the
knight
of
the
white
plume
and
shield
whose
sudden
appearance
and
encounter
with
sacripant
we
have
already
told
was
in
quest
of
rogero
from
whom
chance
had
separated
her
almost
at
the
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
after
her
encounter
with
sacripant
bradamante
pursued
her
way
through
the
forest
in
hopes
of
rejoining
rogero
and
arrived
at
last
on
the
brink
of
a
fair
fountain
this
fountain
flowed
through
a
broad
meadow
ancient
trees
overshadowed
it
and
travellers
attracted
by
the
sweet
murmur
of
its
waters
stopped
there
to
cool
themselves
bradamante
casting
her
eyes
on
all
sides
to
enjoy
the
beauties
of
the
spot
perceived
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
a
knight
reclining
who
seemed
to
be
oppressed
with
the
deepest
grief
bradamante
accosted
him
and
asked
to
be
informed
of
the
cause
of
his
distress
alas
my
lord
said
he
i
lament
a
young
and
charming
friend
my
affianced
wife
who
has
been
torn
from
me
by
a
villain
let
me
rather
call
him
a
demon
who
on
a
winged
horse
descended
from
the
air
seized
her
and
bore
her
screaming
to
his
den
i
have
pursued
them
over
rocks
and
through
ravines
till
my
horse
is
no
longer
able
to
bear
me
and
i
now
wait
only
for
death
he
added
that
already
a
vain
attempt
on
his
behalf
had
been
made
by
two
knights
whom
chance
had
brought
to
the
spot
their
names
were
gradasso
king
of
sericane
and
rogero
the
moor
both
had
been
overcome
by
the
wiles
of
the
enchanter
and
were
added
to
the
number
of
the
captives
whom
he
held
in
an
impregnable
castle
situated
on
the
height
of
the
mountain
at
the
mention
of
rogero
name
bradamante
started
with
delight
which
was
soon
changed
to
an
opposite
sentiment
when
she
heard
that
her
lover
was
a
prisoner
in
the
toils
of
the
enchanter
sir
knight
she
said
do
not
surrender
yourself
to
despair
this
day
may
be
more
happy
for
you
than
you
think
if
you
will
only
lead
me
to
the
castle
which
enfolds
her
whom
you
deplore
the
knight
responded
after
having
lost
all
that
made
life
dear
to
me
i
have
no
motive
to
avoid
the
dangers
of
the
enterprise
and
i
will
do
as
you
request
but
i
forewarn
you
of
the
perils
you
will
have
to
encounter
if
you
fall
impute
it
not
to
me
having
thus
spoken
they
took
their
way
to
the
castle
but
were
overtaken
by
a
messenger
from
the
camp
who
had
been
sent
in
quest
of
bradamante
to
summon
her
back
to
the
army
where
her
presence
was
needed
to
reassure
her
disheartened
forces
and
withstand
the
advance
of
the
moors
the
mournful
knight
whose
name
was
pinabel
thus
became
aware
that
bradamante
was
a
scion
of
the
house
of
clermont
between
which
and
his
own
of
mayence
there
existed
an
ancient
feud
from
this
moment
the
traitor
sought
only
how
he
might
be
rid
of
the
company
of
bradamante
from
whom
he
feared
no
good
would
come
to
him
but
rather
mortal
injury
if
his
name
and
lineage
became
known
to
her
for
he
judged
her
by
his
own
base
model
and
knowing
his
ill
deserts
he
feared
to
receive
his
due
bradamante
in
spite
of
the
summons
to
return
to
the
army
could
not
resolve
to
leave
her
lover
in
captivity
and
determined
first
to
finish
the
adventure
on
which
she
was
engaged
pinabel
leading
the
way
they
at
length
arrived
at
a
wood
in
the
centre
of
which
rose
a
steep
rocky
mountain
pinabel
who
now
thought
of
nothing
else
but
how
he
might
escape
from
bradamante
proposed
to
ascend
the
mountain
to
extend
his
view
in
order
to
discover
a
shelter
for
the
night
if
any
there
might
be
within
sight
under
this
pretence
he
left
bradamante
and
advanced
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
till
he
came
to
a
cleft
in
the
rock
down
which
he
looked
and
perceived
that
it
widened
below
into
a
spacious
cavern
meanwhile
bradamante
fearful
of
losing
her
guide
had
followed
close
on
his
footsteps
and
rejoined
him
at
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
then
the
traitor
seeing
the
impossibility
of
escaping
her
conceived
another
design
he
told
her
that
before
her
approach
he
had
seen
in
the
cavern
a
young
and
beautiful
damsel
whose
rich
dress
announced
her
high
birth
who
with
tears
and
lamentations
implored
assistance
that
before
he
could
descend
to
relieve
her
a
ruffian
had
seized
her
and
hurried
her
away
into
the
recesses
of
the
cavern
bradamante
full
of
truth
and
courage
readily
believed
this
lie
of
the
mayencian
traitor
eager
to
succor
the
damsel
she
looked
round
for
the
means
of
facilitating
the
descent
and
seeing
a
large
elm
with
spreading
branches
she
lopped
off
with
her
sword
one
of
the
largest
and
thrust
it
into
the
opening
she
told
pinabel
to
hold
fast
to
the
larger
end
while
grasping
the
branches
with
her
hands
she
let
herself
down
into
the
cavern
the
traitor
smiled
at
seeing
her
thus
suspended
and
asking
her
in
mockery
are
you
a
good
leaper
he
let
go
the
branch
with
perfidious
glee
and
saw
bradamante
precipitated
to
the
bottom
of
the
cave
i
wish
your
whole
race
were
there
with
you
he
muttered
that
you
might
all
perish
together
but
pinabel
atrocious
design
was
not
accomplished
the
twigs
and
foliage
of
the
branch
broke
its
descent
and
bradamante
not
seriously
injured
though
stunned
with
her
fall
was
reserved
for
other
adventures
as
soon
as
she
recovered
from
the
shock
bradamante
cast
her
eyes
around
and
perceived
a
door
through
which
she
passed
into
a
second
cavern
larger
and
loftier
than
the
first
it
had
the
appearance
of
a
subterranean
temple
columns
of
the
purest
alabaster
adorned
it
and
supported
the
roof
a
simple
altar
rose
in
the
middle
a
lamp
whose
radiance
was
reflected
by
the
alabaster
walls
cast
a
mild
light
around
bradamante
inspired
by
a
sense
of
religious
awe
approached
the
altar
and
falling
on
her
knees
poured
forth
her
prayers
and
thanks
to
the
preserver
of
her
life
invoking
the
protection
of
his
power
at
that
moment
a
small
door
opened
and
a
female
issued
from
it
with
naked
feet
and
flowing
robe
and
hair
who
called
her
by
her
name
and
thus
addressed
her
brave
and
generous
bradamante
know
that
it
is
a
power
from
above
that
has
brought
you
hither
the
spirit
of
merlin
whose
last
earthly
abode
was
in
this
place
has
warned
me
of
your
arrival
and
of
the
fate
that
awaits
you
this
famous
grotto
she
continued
was
the
work
of
the
enchanter
merlin
here
his
ashes
repose
you
have
no
doubt
heard
how
this
sage
and
virtuous
enchanter
ceased
to
be
victim
of
the
artful
fairy
of
the
lake
merlin
by
a
fatal
compliance
with
her
request
laid
himself
down
living
in
his
tomb
without
power
to
resist
the
spell
laid
upon
him
by
that
ingrate
who
retained
him
there
as
long
as
he
lived
his
spirit
hovers
about
this
spot
and
will
not
leave
it
until
the
last
trumpet
shall
summon
the
dead
to
judgment
he
answers
the
questions
of
those
who
approach
his
tomb
where
perhaps
you
may
be
privileged
to
hear
his
voice
bradamante
astonished
at
these
words
and
the
objects
which
met
her
view
knew
not
whether
she
was
awake
or
asleep
confused
but
modest
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
a
blush
overspread
her
face
ah
what
am
i
said
she
that
so
great
a
prophet
should
deign
to
speak
to
me
still
with
a
secret
satisfaction
she
followed
the
priestess
who
led
her
to
the
tomb
of
merlin
this
tomb
was
constructed
of
a
species
of
stone
hard
and
resplendent
like
fire
the
rays
which
beamed
from
the
stone
sufficed
to
light
up
that
terrible
place
where
the
sun
rays
never
penetrated
but
i
know
not
whether
that
light
was
the
effect
of
a
certain
phosphorescence
of
the
stone
itself
or
of
the
many
talismans
and
charms
with
which
it
was
wrought
over
bradamante
had
hardly
passed
the
threshold
of
this
sacred
place
when
the
spirit
of
the
enchanter
saluted
her
with
a
voice
firm
and
distinct
may
thy
designs
be
prosperous
o
chaste
and
noble
maiden
the
future
mother
of
heroes
the
glory
of
italy
and
destined
to
fill
the
whole
world
with
their
fame
great
captains
renowned
knights
shall
be
numbered
among
your
descendants
who
shall
defend
the
church
and
restore
their
country
to
its
ancient
splendor
princes
wise
as
augustus
and
the
sage
numa
shall
bring
back
the
age
of
gold
footnote
this
prophecy
is
introduced
by
ariosto
in
this
place
to
compliment
the
noble
house
of
este
the
princes
of
his
native
state
the
dukedom
of
ferrara
to
accomplish
these
grand
destinies
it
is
ordained
that
you
shall
wed
the
illustrious
rogero
fly
then
to
his
deliverance
and
lay
prostrate
in
the
dust
the
traitor
who
has
snatched
him
from
you
and
now
holds
him
in
chains
merlin
ceased
with
these
words
and
left
to
melissa
the
priestess
the
charge
of
more
fully
instructing
the
maiden
in
her
future
course
said
she
i
will
conduct
you
to
the
castle
on
the
rock
where
rogero
is
held
captive
i
will
not
leave
you
till
i
have
guided
you
through
this
wild
wood
and
i
will
direct
you
on
your
way
so
that
you
shall
be
in
no
danger
of
mistaking
it
the
next
morning
melissa
conducted
bradamante
between
rocks
and
precipices
crossing
rapid
torrents
and
traversing
intricate
passes
employing
the
time
in
imparting
to
her
such
information
as
was
necessary
to
enable
her
to
bring
her
design
to
a
successful
issue
not
only
would
the
castle
impenetrable
by
force
and
that
winged
horse
of
his
baffle
your
efforts
but
know
that
he
possesses
also
a
buckler
whence
flashes
a
light
so
brilliant
that
the
eyes
of
all
who
look
upon
it
are
blinded
think
not
to
avoid
it
by
shutting
your
eyes
for
how
then
will
you
be
able
to
avoid
his
blows
and
make
him
feel
your
own
but
i
will
teach
you
the
proper
course
to
pursue
agramant
the
moorish
prince
possesses
a
ring
stolen
from
a
queen
of
india
which
has
power
to
render
of
no
avail
all
enchantments
agramant
knowing
that
rogero
is
of
more
importance
to
him
than
any
one
of
his
warriors
is
desirous
of
rescuing
him
from
the
power
of
the
enchanter
and
has
sent
for
that
purpose
brunello
the
most
crafty
and
sagacious
of
his
servants
provided
with
his
wonderful
ring
and
he
is
even
now
at
hand
bent
on
this
enterprise
but
beautiful
bradamante
as
i
desire
that
no
one
but
yourself
shall
have
the
glory
of
delivering
from
thraldom
your
future
spouse
listen
while
i
disclose
the
means
of
success
following
this
path
which
leads
by
the
seashore
you
will
come
ere
long
to
a
hostelry
where
the
saracen
brunello
will
arrive
shortly
before
you
you
will
readily
know
him
by
his
stature
under
four
feet
his
great
disproportioned
head
his
squint
eyes
his
livid
hue
his
thick
eyebrows
joining
his
tufted
beard
his
dress
moreover
that
of
a
courier
will
point
him
out
to
you
it
will
be
easy
for
you
to
enter
into
conversation
with
him
announcing
yourself
as
a
knight
seeking
combat
with
the
enchanter
but
let
not
the
knave
suspect
that
you
know
anything
about
the
ring
i
doubt
not
that
he
will
be
your
guide
to
the
castle
of
the
enchanter
accept
his
offer
but
take
care
to
keep
behind
him
till
you
come
in
sight
of
the
brilliant
dome
of
the
castle
then
hesitate
not
to
strike
him
dead
for
the
wretch
deserves
no
pity
and
take
from
him
the
ring
but
let
him
not
suspect
your
intention
for
by
putting
the
ring
into
his
mouth
he
will
instantly
become
invisible
and
disappear
from
your
eyes
saying
thus
the
sage
melissa
and
the
fair
bradamante
arrived
near
the
city
of
bordeaux
where
the
rich
and
wide
river
garonne
pours
the
tribute
of
its
waves
into
the
sea
they
parted
with
tender
embraces
bradamante
intent
wholly
on
her
purpose
hastened
to
arrive
at
the
hostelry
where
brunello
had
preceded
her
a
few
moments
only
the
young
heroine
knew
him
without
difficulty
she
accosted
him
and
put
to
him
some
slight
questions
to
which
he
replied
with
adroit
falsehoods
bradamante
on
her
part
concealed
from
him
her
sex
her
religion
her
country
and
the
blood
from
whence
she
sprung
while
they
talk
together
sudden
cries
are
heard
from
all
parts
of
the
hostelry
o
queen
of
heaven
exclaimed
bradamante
what
can
be
the
cause
of
this
sudden
alarm
she
soon
learned
the
cause
host
children
domestics
all
with
upturned
eyes
as
if
they
saw
a
comet
or
a
great
eclipse
were
gazing
on
a
prodigy
which
seemed
to
pass
the
bounds
of
possibility
she
beheld
distinctly
a
winged
horse
mounted
with
a
cavalier
in
rich
armor
cleaving
the
air
with
rapid
flight
the
wings
of
this
strange
courser
were
wide
extended
and
covered
with
feathers
of
various
colors
the
polished
armor
of
the
knight
made
them
shine
with
rainbow
tints
in
a
short
time
the
horse
and
rider
disappeared
behind
the
summits
of
the
mountains
it
is
an
enchanter
said
the
host
a
magician
who
often
is
seen
traversing
the
air
in
that
way
sometimes
he
flies
aloft
as
if
among
the
stars
and
at
others
skims
along
the
land
he
possesses
a
wonderful
castle
on
the
top
of
the
pyrenees
many
knights
have
shown
their
courage
by
going
to
attack
him
but
none
have
ever
returned
from
which
it
is
to
be
feared
they
have
lost
either
their
life
or
their
liberty
bradamante
addressing
the
host
said
could
you
furnish
me
a
guide
to
conduct
me
to
the
castle
of
this
enchanter
by
my
faith
said
brunello
interrupting
that
you
shall
not
seek
in
vain
i
have
it
all
in
writing
and
i
will
myself
conduct
you
bradamante
with
thanks
accepted
him
for
her
guide
the
host
had
a
tolerable
horse
to
dispose
of
which
bradamante
bargained
for
and
the
next
day
at
the
first
dawn
of
morning
she
took
her
route
by
a
narrow
valley
taking
care
to
have
the
saracen
brunello
lead
the
way
they
reached
the
summit
of
the
pyrenees
whence
one
may
look
down
on
france
spain
and
the
two
seas
from
this
height
they
descended
again
by
a
fatiguing
road
into
a
deep
valley
from
the
middle
of
this
valley
an
isolated
mountain
rose
composed
of
rough
and
perpendicular
rock
on
whose
summit
was
the
castle
surrounded
with
a
wall
of
brass
brunello
said
yonder
is
the
stronghold
where
the
enchanter
keeps
his
prisoners
one
must
have
wings
to
mount
thither
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
aid
of
a
flying
horse
must
be
necessary
for
the
master
of
this
castle
which
he
uses
for
his
prison
and
for
his
abode
bradamante
sufficiently
instructed
saw
that
the
time
had
now
come
to
possess
herself
of
the
ring
but
she
could
not
resolve
to
slay
a
defenceless
man
she
seized
brunello
before
he
was
aware
bound
him
to
a
tree
and
took
from
him
the
ring
which
he
wore
on
one
of
his
fingers
the
cries
and
entreaties
of
the
perfidious
saracen
moved
her
not
she
advanced
to
the
foot
of
the
rock
whereon
the
castle
stood
and
to
draw
the
magician
to
the
combat
sounded
her
horn
adding
to
it
cries
of
defiance
the
enchanter
delayed
not
to
present
himself
mounted
on
his
winged
horse
bradamante
was
struck
with
surprise
mixed
with
joy
when
she
saw
that
this
person
described
as
so
formidable
bore
no
lance
nor
club
nor
any
other
deadly
weapon
he
had
only
on
his
arm
a
buckler
covered
with
a
cloth
and
in
his
hand
an
open
book
as
to
the
winged
horse
there
was
no
enchantment
about
him
he
was
a
natural
animal
of
a
species
which
exists
in
the
riphaean
mountains
like
a
griffin
he
had
the
head
of
an
eagle
claws
armed
with
talons
and
wings
covered
with
feathers
the
rest
of
his
body
being
that
of
a
horse
this
strange
animal
is
called
a
hippogriff
the
heroine
attacked
the
enchanter
on
his
approach
striking
on
this
side
and
on
that
with
all
the
energy
of
a
violent
combat
but
wounding
only
the
wind
and
after
this
pretended
attack
had
lasted
some
time
dismounted
from
her
horse
as
if
hoping
to
do
battle
more
effectually
on
foot
the
enchanter
now
prepares
to
employ
his
sole
weapon
by
uncovering
the
magic
buckler
which
never
failed
to
subdue
an
enemy
by
depriving
him
of
his
senses
bradamante
confiding
in
her
ring
observed
all
the
motions
of
her
adversary
and
at
the
unveiling
of
the
shield
cast
herself
on
the
ground
pretending
that
the
splendor
of
the
shield
had
overcome
her
but
in
reality
to
induce
the
enchanter
to
dismount
and
approach
her
it
happened
according
to
her
wish
when
the
enchanter
saw
her
prostrate
he
made
his
horse
alight
on
the
ground
and
dismounting
fixed
the
shield
on
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
and
approached
in
order
to
secure
the
fallen
warrior
bradamante
who
watched
him
intently
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
near
at
hand
sprang
up
seized
him
vigorously
threw
him
down
and
with
the
same
chain
which
the
enchanter
had
prepared
for
herself
bound
him
fast
without
his
being
able
to
make
any
effectual
resistance
the
enchanter
with
the
accents
of
despair
exclaimed
take
my
life
young
man
but
bradamante
was
far
from
complying
with
such
a
wish
desirous
of
knowing
the
name
of
the
enchanter
and
for
what
purpose
he
had
formed
with
so
much
art
this
impregnable
fortress
she
commanded
him
to
inform
her
alas
replied
the
magician
while
tears
flowed
down
his
cheeks
it
is
not
to
conceal
booty
nor
for
any
culpable
design
that
i
have
built
this
castle
it
was
only
to
guard
the
life
of
a
young
knight
the
object
of
my
tenderest
affection
my
art
having
taught
me
that
he
is
destined
to
become
a
christian
and
to
perish
shortly
after
by
the
blackest
of
treasons
this
youth
named
rogero
is
the
most
beautiful
and
most
accomplished
of
knights
it
is
i
the
unhappy
atlantes
who
have
reared
him
from
his
childhood
the
call
of
honor
and
the
desire
of
glory
led
him
from
me
to
follow
agramant
his
prince
in
his
invasion
of
france
and
i
more
devoted
to
rogero
than
the
tenderest
of
parents
have
sought
the
means
of
bringing
him
back
to
this
abode
in
the
hope
of
saving
him
from
the
cruel
fate
that
menaces
him
for
this
purpose
i
have
got
him
in
my
possession
by
the
same
means
as
i
attempted
to
employ
against
you
and
by
which
i
have
succeeded
in
collecting
a
great
many
knights
and
ladies
in
my
castle
my
purpose
was
to
render
my
beloved
pupil
captivity
light
by
affording
him
society
to
amuse
him
and
keep
his
thoughts
from
running
on
subjects
of
war
and
glory
alas
my
cares
have
been
in
vain
yet
take
i
beseech
you
whatever
else
i
have
but
spare
me
my
beloved
pupil
take
this
shield
take
this
winged
courser
deliver
such
of
your
friends
as
you
may
find
among
my
prisoners
deliver
them
all
if
you
will
but
leave
me
my
beloved
rogero
or
if
you
will
snatch
him
too
from
me
take
also
my
life
which
will
cease
then
to
be
to
me
worth
preserving
bradamante
replied
old
man
hope
not
to
move
me
by
your
vain
entreaties
it
is
precisely
the
liberty
of
rogero
that
i
require
you
would
keep
him
here
in
bondage
and
in
slothful
pleasure
to
save
him
from
a
fate
which
you
foresee
vain
old
man
how
can
you
foresee
his
fate
when
you
could
not
foresee
your
own
you
desire
me
to
take
your
life
no
my
aim
and
my
soul
refuse
the
request
this
said
she
required
the
magician
to
go
before
and
guide
her
to
the
castle
the
prisoners
were
set
at
liberty
though
some
in
their
secret
hearts
regretted
the
voluptuous
life
which
was
thus
brought
to
an
end
bradamante
and
rogero
met
one
another
with
transports
of
joy
they
descended
from
the
mountain
to
the
spot
where
the
encounter
had
taken
place
there
they
found
the
hippogriff
with
the
magic
buckler
in
its
wrapper
hanging
to
his
bradamante
advanced
to
seize
the
bridle
the
hippogriff
seemed
to
wait
her
approach
but
before
she
reached
him
he
spread
his
wings
and
flew
away
to
a
neighboring
hill
and
in
the
same
manner
a
second
time
eluded
her
efforts
rogero
and
the
other
liberated
knights
dispersed
over
the
plain
and
hilltops
to
secure
him
and
at
last
the
animal
allowed
rogero
to
seize
his
rein
the
fearless
rogero
hesitated
not
to
vault
upon
his
back
and
let
him
feel
his
spurs
which
so
roused
his
mettle
that
after
galloping
a
short
distance
he
suddenly
spread
his
wings
and
soared
into
the
air
bradamante
had
the
grief
to
see
her
lover
snatched
away
from
her
at
the
very
moment
of
reunion
rogero
who
knew
not
the
art
of
directing
the
horse
was
unable
to
control
his
flight
he
found
himself
carried
over
the
tops
of
the
mountains
so
far
above
them
that
he
could
hardly
distinguish
what
was
land
and
what
water
the
hippogriff
directed
his
flight
to
the
west
and
cleaved
the
air
as
swiftly
as
a
vessel
cuts
the
waves
impelled
by
the
freshest
and
most
favorable
gales
astolpho
and
the
enchantress
in
the
long
flight
which
rogero
took
on
the
back
of
the
hippogriff
he
was
carried
over
land
and
sea
unknowing
whither
as
soon
as
he
had
gained
some
control
over
the
animal
he
made
him
alight
on
the
nearest
land
when
he
came
near
enough
to
earth
rogero
leapt
lightly
from
his
back
and
tied
the
animal
to
a
near
the
spot
flowed
the
pure
waters
of
a
fountain
surrounded
by
cedars
and
rogero
laid
aside
his
shield
and
removing
his
helmet
breathed
with
delight
the
fresh
air
and
cooled
his
lips
with
the
waters
of
the
fountain
for
we
can
not
wonder
that
he
was
excessively
fatigued
considering
the
ride
he
had
taken
he
was
preparing
to
taste
the
sweets
of
repose
when
he
perceived
that
the
hippogriff
which
he
had
tied
by
the
bridle
to
a
frightened
at
something
was
making
violent
efforts
to
disengage
himself
his
struggle
shook
the
so
that
many
of
its
beautiful
leaves
were
torn
off
and
strewed
the
ground
a
sound
like
that
which
issues
from
burning
wood
seemed
to
come
from
the
at
first
faint
and
indistinct
but
growing
stronger
by
degrees
and
at
length
was
audible
as
a
voice
which
spoke
in
this
manner
o
knight
if
the
tenderness
of
your
heart
corresponds
to
the
beauty
of
your
person
relieve
me
i
pray
you
from
this
tormenting
animal
i
suffer
enough
inwardly
without
having
outward
evils
added
to
my
lot
rogero
at
the
first
accents
of
this
voice
turned
his
eyes
promptly
on
the
myrtle
hastened
to
it
and
stood
fixed
in
astonishment
when
he
perceived
that
the
voice
issued
from
the
tree
itself
he
immediately
untied
his
horse
and
flushed
with
surprise
and
regret
exclaimed
whoever
thou
art
whether
mortal
or
the
goddess
of
these
woods
forgive
me
i
beseech
you
my
involuntary
fault
had
i
imagined
that
this
hard
bark
covered
a
being
possessed
of
feeling
could
i
have
exposed
such
a
beautiful
myrtle
to
the
insults
of
this
steed
may
the
sweet
influences
of
the
sky
and
air
speedily
repair
the
injury
i
have
done
for
my
part
i
promise
by
the
sovereign
lady
of
my
heart
to
do
everything
you
wish
in
order
to
merit
your
forgiveness
at
these
words
the
myrtle
seemed
to
tremble
from
root
to
stem
and
rogero
remarked
that
a
moisture
as
of
tears
trickled
down
its
bark
like
that
which
exudes
from
a
log
placed
on
the
fire
it
then
spoke
the
kindness
which
inspires
your
words
compels
me
to
disclose
to
you
who
i
once
was
and
by
what
fatality
i
have
been
changed
into
this
shape
my
name
was
astolpho
cousin
of
orlando
and
rinaldo
whose
fame
has
filled
the
earth
i
was
myself
reckoned
among
the
bravest
paladins
of
france
and
was
by
birth
entitled
to
reign
over
england
after
otho
my
father
returning
from
the
distant
east
with
rinaldo
and
many
other
brave
knights
called
home
to
aid
with
our
arms
the
great
emperor
of
france
we
reached
a
spot
where
the
powerful
enchantress
alcina
possessed
a
castle
on
the
borders
of
the
sea
she
had
gone
to
the
to
amuse
herself
with
fishing
and
we
paused
to
see
how
by
her
art
without
hook
or
line
she
drew
from
the
water
whatever
she
would
not
far
from
the
shore
an
enormous
whale
showed
a
back
so
broad
and
motionless
that
it
looked
like
an
island
alcina
had
fixed
her
eyes
on
me
and
planned
to
get
me
into
her
power
addressing
us
she
said
is
the
hour
when
the
prettiest
mermaid
in
the
sea
comes
regularly
every
day
to
the
shore
of
yonder
island
she
sings
so
sweetly
that
the
very
waves
flow
smoother
at
the
sound
if
you
wish
to
hear
her
come
with
me
to
her
resort
so
saying
alcina
pointed
to
the
fish
which
we
all
supposed
to
be
an
island
i
who
was
rash
did
not
hesitate
to
follow
her
but
swam
my
horse
over
and
mounted
on
the
back
of
the
fish
in
vain
rinaldo
and
dudon
made
signs
to
me
to
beware
alcina
smiling
took
me
in
charge
and
led
the
way
no
sooner
were
we
mounted
upon
him
than
the
whale
moved
off
spreading
his
great
fins
and
cleft
rapidly
the
waters
i
then
saw
my
folly
but
it
was
too
late
to
repent
alcina
soothed
my
anger
and
professed
that
what
she
had
done
was
for
love
of
me
ere
long
we
arrived
at
this
island
where
at
first
everything
was
done
to
reconcile
me
to
my
lot
and
to
make
my
days
pass
happily
away
but
soon
alcina
sated
with
her
conquest
grew
indifferent
then
weary
of
me
and
at
last
to
get
rid
of
me
changed
me
into
this
form
as
she
had
done
to
many
lovers
before
me
making
some
of
them
olives
some
palms
some
cedars
changing
others
into
fountains
rocks
or
even
into
wild
beasts
and
thou
courteous
knight
whom
accident
has
brought
to
this
enchanted
isle
beware
that
she
get
not
the
power
over
thee
or
thou
shalt
haply
be
made
like
us
a
tree
a
fountain
or
a
rock
rogero
expressed
his
astonishment
at
this
recital
astolpho
added
that
the
island
was
in
great
part
subject
to
the
sway
of
alcina
by
the
aid
of
her
sister
morgana
she
had
succeeded
in
dispossessing
a
third
sister
logestilla
of
nearly
the
whole
of
her
patrimony
for
the
whole
isle
was
hers
originally
by
her
father
bequest
but
logestilla
was
temperate
and
sage
while
the
other
sisters
were
false
and
voluptuous
her
empire
was
divided
from
theirs
by
a
gulf
and
chain
of
mountains
which
alone
had
thus
far
prevented
her
sister
from
usurping
it
astolpho
here
ended
his
tale
and
rogero
who
knew
that
he
was
the
cousin
of
bradamante
would
gladly
have
devised
some
way
for
his
relief
but
as
that
was
out
of
his
power
he
consoled
him
as
well
as
he
could
and
then
begged
to
be
told
the
way
to
the
palace
of
logestilla
and
how
to
avoid
that
of
alcina
astolpho
directed
him
to
take
the
road
to
the
left
though
rough
and
full
of
rocks
he
warned
him
that
this
road
would
present
serious
obstacles
that
troops
of
monsters
would
oppose
his
passage
employed
by
the
art
of
alcina
to
prevent
her
subjects
from
escaping
from
her
dominion
rogero
thanked
the
myrtle
and
prepared
to
set
out
on
his
way
he
at
first
thought
he
would
mount
the
winged
horse
and
scale
the
mountain
on
his
back
but
he
was
too
uncertain
of
his
power
to
control
him
to
wish
to
encounter
the
hazard
of
another
flight
through
the
air
besides
that
he
was
almost
famished
for
the
want
of
food
so
he
led
the
horse
after
him
and
took
the
road
on
foot
which
for
some
distance
led
equally
to
the
dominions
of
both
the
sisters
he
had
not
advanced
more
than
two
miles
when
he
saw
before
him
the
superb
city
of
alcina
it
was
surrounded
with
a
wall
of
gold
which
seemed
to
reach
the
skies
i
know
that
some
think
that
this
wall
was
not
of
real
gold
but
only
the
work
of
alchemy
it
matters
not
i
prefer
to
think
it
gold
for
it
certainly
shone
like
gold
a
broad
and
level
road
led
to
the
gates
of
the
city
and
from
this
another
branched
off
narrow
and
rough
which
led
to
the
mountain
region
rogero
took
without
hesitation
the
narrow
road
but
he
had
no
sooner
entered
upon
it
than
he
was
assailed
by
a
numerous
troop
which
opposed
his
passage
you
never
have
seen
anything
so
ridiculous
so
extraordinary
as
this
host
of
hobgoblins
were
some
of
them
bore
the
human
form
from
the
neck
to
the
feet
but
had
the
head
of
a
monkey
or
a
cat
others
had
the
legs
and
the
ears
of
a
horse
old
men
and
women
bald
and
hideous
ran
hither
and
thither
as
if
out
of
their
senses
half
clad
in
the
shaggy
skins
of
beasts
one
rode
full
speed
on
a
horse
without
a
bridle
another
jogged
along
mounted
on
an
ass
or
a
cow
others
full
of
agility
skipped
about
and
clung
to
the
tails
and
manes
of
the
animals
which
their
companions
rode
some
blew
horns
others
brandished
some
were
armed
with
spits
and
some
with
pitchforks
one
who
appeared
to
be
the
captain
had
an
enormous
belly
and
a
gross
fat
head
he
was
mounted
on
a
tortoise
that
waddled
now
this
way
now
that
without
keeping
any
one
direction
one
of
these
monsters
who
had
something
approaching
the
human
form
though
he
had
the
neck
ears
and
muzzle
of
a
dog
set
himself
to
bark
furiously
at
rogero
to
make
him
turn
off
to
the
right
and
reenter
upon
the
road
to
the
gay
city
but
the
brave
chevalier
exclaimed
that
will
i
not
so
long
as
i
can
use
this
sword
and
he
thrust
the
point
directly
at
his
face
the
monster
tried
to
strike
him
with
a
lance
but
rogero
was
too
quick
for
him
and
thrust
his
sword
through
his
body
so
that
it
appeared
a
hand
breadth
behind
his
back
the
paladin
now
giving
full
vent
to
his
rage
laid
about
him
vigorously
among
the
rabble
cleaving
one
to
the
teeth
another
to
the
girdle
but
the
troop
were
so
numerous
and
in
spite
of
his
blows
pressed
around
him
so
close
that
to
clear
his
way
he
must
have
had
as
many
arms
as
briareus
if
rogero
had
uncovered
the
shield
of
the
enchanter
which
hung
at
his
he
might
easily
have
vanquished
this
monstrous
rout
but
perhaps
he
did
not
think
of
it
and
perhaps
he
preferred
to
seek
his
defence
nowhere
but
in
his
good
sword
at
that
moment
when
his
perplexity
was
at
its
height
he
saw
issue
from
the
city
gate
two
young
beauties
whose
air
and
dress
proclaimed
their
rank
and
gentle
nurture
each
of
them
was
mounted
on
a
unicorn
whose
whiteness
surpassed
that
of
ermine
they
advanced
to
the
meadow
where
rogero
was
contending
so
valiantly
against
the
hobgoblins
who
all
retired
at
their
approach
they
drew
near
they
extended
their
hands
to
the
young
warrior
whose
cheeks
glowed
with
the
flush
of
exercise
and
modesty
grateful
for
their
assistance
he
expressed
his
thanks
and
having
no
heart
to
refuse
them
followed
their
guidance
to
the
gate
of
the
city
this
grand
and
beautiful
entrance
was
adorned
by
a
portico
of
four
vast
columns
all
of
diamond
whether
they
were
real
diamond
or
artificial
i
can
not
say
what
matter
is
it
so
long
as
they
appeared
to
the
eye
like
diamond
and
nothing
could
be
more
gay
and
splendid
on
the
threshold
and
between
the
columns
was
seen
a
bevy
of
charming
young
women
who
played
and
frolicked
together
they
all
ran
to
receive
rogero
and
conducted
him
into
the
palace
which
appeared
like
a
paradise
we
might
well
call
by
that
name
this
abode
where
the
hours
flew
by
without
account
in
delights
the
bare
idea
of
satiety
want
and
above
all
of
age
never
entered
the
minds
of
the
inhabitants
they
experienced
no
sensations
except
those
of
luxury
and
gayety
the
cup
of
happiness
seemed
for
them
and
exhaustless
the
two
young
damsels
to
whom
rogero
owed
his
deliverance
from
the
hobgoblins
conducted
him
to
the
apartment
of
their
mistress
the
beautiful
alcina
advanced
and
greeted
him
with
an
air
at
once
dignified
and
courteous
all
her
court
surrounded
the
paladin
and
rendered
him
the
most
flattering
attentions
the
castle
was
less
admirable
for
its
magnificence
than
for
the
charms
of
those
who
inhabited
it
they
were
of
either
sex
well
matched
in
beauty
youth
and
grace
but
among
this
charming
group
the
brilliant
alcina
shone
as
the
sun
outshines
the
stars
the
young
warrior
was
fascinated
all
that
he
had
heard
from
the
appeared
to
him
but
a
vile
calumny
how
could
he
suspect
that
falsehood
and
treason
veiled
themselves
under
smiles
and
the
ingenuous
air
of
truth
he
doubted
not
that
astolpho
had
deserved
his
fate
and
perhaps
a
punishment
more
severe
he
regarded
all
his
stories
as
dictated
by
a
disappointed
spirit
and
a
thirst
for
revenge
but
we
must
not
condemn
rogero
too
harshly
for
he
was
the
victim
of
magic
power
they
seated
themselves
at
table
and
immediately
harmonious
lyres
and
harps
waked
the
air
with
the
most
ravishing
notes
the
charms
of
poetry
were
added
in
entertaining
recitals
the
magnificence
of
the
feast
would
have
done
credit
to
a
royal
board
the
traitress
forgot
nothing
which
might
charm
the
paladin
and
attach
him
to
the
spot
meaning
when
she
should
grow
tired
of
him
to
metamorphose
him
as
she
had
done
others
in
the
same
manner
passed
each
succeeding
day
games
of
pleasant
exercise
the
chase
the
dance
or
rural
sports
made
the
hours
pass
quickly
while
they
gave
zest
to
the
refreshment
of
the
bath
or
sleep
thus
rogero
led
a
life
of
ease
and
luxury
while
charlemagne
and
agramant
were
struggling
for
empire
but
i
can
not
linger
with
him
while
the
amiable
and
courageous
bradamante
is
night
and
day
directing
her
uncertain
steps
to
every
spot
where
the
slightest
chance
invites
her
in
the
hope
of
recovering
rogero
i
will
therefore
say
that
having
sought
him
in
vain
in
fields
and
in
cities
she
knew
not
whither
next
to
direct
her
steps
she
did
not
apprehend
the
death
of
rogero
the
fall
of
such
a
hero
would
have
reechoed
from
the
hydaspes
to
the
farthest
river
of
the
west
but
not
knowing
whether
he
was
on
the
earth
or
in
the
air
she
concluded
as
a
last
resource
to
return
to
the
cavern
which
contained
the
tomb
of
merlin
to
ask
of
him
some
sure
direction
to
the
object
of
her
search
while
this
thought
occupied
her
mind
melissa
the
sage
enchantress
suddenly
appeared
before
her
this
virtuous
and
beneficent
magician
had
discovered
by
her
spells
that
rogero
was
passing
his
time
in
pleasure
and
idleness
forgetful
of
his
honor
and
his
sovereign
not
able
to
endure
the
thought
that
one
who
was
born
to
be
a
hero
should
waste
his
years
in
base
repose
and
leave
a
sullied
reputation
in
the
memory
of
survivors
she
saw
that
vigorous
measures
must
be
employed
to
draw
him
forth
into
the
paths
of
virtue
melissa
was
not
blinded
by
her
affection
for
the
amiable
paladin
like
atlantes
who
intent
only
on
preserving
rogero
life
cared
nothing
for
his
fame
it
was
that
old
enchanter
whose
arts
had
guided
the
hippogriff
to
the
isle
of
the
too
charming
alcina
where
he
hoped
his
favorite
would
learn
to
forget
honor
and
lose
the
love
of
glory
at
the
sight
of
melissa
joy
lighted
up
the
countenance
of
bradamante
and
hope
animated
her
breast
melissa
concealed
nothing
from
her
but
told
her
how
rogero
was
in
the
toils
of
alcina
bradamante
was
plunged
in
grief
and
terror
but
the
kind
enchantress
calmed
her
dispelled
her
fears
and
promised
that
before
many
days
she
would
lead
back
the
paladin
to
her
feet
my
daughter
she
said
give
me
the
ring
which
you
wear
and
which
possesses
the
power
to
overcome
enchantments
by
means
of
it
i
doubt
not
but
that
i
may
enter
the
stronghold
where
the
false
alcina
holds
rogero
in
durance
and
may
succeed
in
vanquishing
her
and
liberating
him
bradamante
unhesitatingly
delivered
her
the
ring
recommending
rogero
to
her
best
efforts
melissa
then
summoned
by
her
art
a
huge
palfrey
black
as
jet
excepting
one
foot
which
was
bay
mounted
upon
this
animal
she
rode
with
such
speed
that
by
the
next
morning
she
had
reached
the
abode
of
alcina
she
here
transformed
herself
into
the
perfect
resemblance
of
the
old
magician
atlantes
adding
a
to
her
height
and
enlarging
her
whole
figure
her
chin
she
covered
with
a
long
beard
and
seamed
her
whole
visage
well
with
wrinkles
she
assumed
also
his
voice
and
manner
and
watched
her
chance
to
find
rogero
alone
at
last
she
found
him
dressed
in
a
rich
tunic
of
silk
and
gold
a
collar
of
precious
stones
about
his
neck
and
his
arms
once
so
rough
with
exercise
decorated
with
bracelets
his
air
and
his
every
motion
indicated
effeminacy
and
he
seemed
to
retain
nothing
of
rogero
but
the
name
such
power
had
the
enchantress
obtained
over
him
melissa
under
the
form
of
his
old
instructor
presented
herself
before
him
wearing
a
stern
and
serious
visage
is
this
then
she
said
the
fruit
of
all
my
labors
is
it
for
this
that
i
fed
you
on
the
marrow
of
bears
and
lions
that
i
taught
you
to
subdue
dragons
and
like
hercules
strangle
serpents
in
your
youthful
grasp
only
to
make
you
by
all
my
cares
a
feeble
adonis
my
nightly
watchings
of
the
stars
of
the
yet
warm
fibres
of
animals
the
lots
i
have
cast
the
points
of
nativity
that
i
have
calculated
have
they
all
falsely
indicated
that
you
were
born
for
greatness
who
could
have
believed
that
you
would
become
the
slave
of
a
base
enchantress
o
rogero
learn
to
know
this
alcina
learn
to
understand
her
arts
and
to
countervail
them
take
this
ring
place
it
on
your
finger
return
to
her
presence
and
see
for
yourself
what
are
her
real
charms
at
these
words
rogero
confused
abashed
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
and
knew
not
what
to
answer
melissa
seized
the
moment
slipped
the
ring
on
his
finger
and
the
paladin
was
himself
again
what
a
thunderclap
to
him
overcome
by
shame
he
dared
not
to
encounter
the
looks
of
his
instructor
when
at
last
he
raised
his
eyes
he
beheld
not
that
venerable
form
but
the
priestess
melissa
who
in
virtue
of
the
ring
now
appeared
in
her
true
person
she
told
him
of
the
motives
which
had
led
her
to
come
to
his
rescue
of
the
griefs
and
regrets
of
bradamante
and
of
her
unwearied
search
for
him
that
charming
amazon
she
said
sends
you
this
ring
which
is
a
sovereign
antidote
to
all
enchantments
she
would
have
sent
you
her
heart
in
my
hands
if
it
would
have
had
greater
power
to
serve
you
it
was
needless
for
melissa
to
say
more
rogero
love
for
alcina
being
but
the
work
of
enchantment
vanished
as
soon
as
the
enchantment
was
withdrawn
and
he
now
hated
her
with
an
equal
intensity
seeing
no
longer
anything
in
her
but
her
vices
and
feeling
only
resentment
for
the
shame
that
she
had
put
upon
him
his
surprise
when
he
again
beheld
alcina
was
no
less
than
his
indignation
fortified
by
his
ring
from
her
enchantments
he
saw
her
as
she
was
a
monster
of
ugliness
all
her
charms
were
artificial
and
truly
viewed
were
rather
deformities
she
was
in
fact
older
than
hecuba
or
the
sibyl
of
cumae
but
an
art
which
it
is
to
be
regretted
our
times
have
lost
enabled
her
to
appear
charming
and
to
clothe
herself
in
all
the
attractions
of
youth
rogero
now
saw
all
this
but
governed
by
the
counsels
of
melissa
he
concealed
his
surprise
assumed
under
some
pretext
his
armor
long
neglected
and
bound
to
his
side
belisarda
his
trusty
sword
taking
also
the
buckler
of
atlantes
covered
with
its
veil
he
then
selected
a
horse
from
the
stables
of
alcina
without
exciting
her
suspicions
but
he
left
the
hippogriff
by
the
advice
of
melissa
who
promised
to
take
him
in
charge
and
train
him
to
a
more
manageable
state
the
horse
he
took
was
rabican
which
belonged
to
astolpho
he
restored
the
ring
to
melissa
rogero
had
not
ridden
far
when
he
met
one
of
the
huntsmen
of
alcina
bearing
a
falcon
on
his
wrist
and
followed
by
a
dog
the
huntsman
was
mounted
on
a
powerful
horse
and
came
boldly
up
to
the
paladin
demanding
in
a
somewhat
imperious
manner
whither
he
was
going
so
rapidly
rogero
disdained
to
stop
or
to
reply
whereupon
the
huntsman
not
doubting
that
he
was
about
making
his
escape
said
what
if
i
with
my
falcon
stop
your
ride
so
saying
he
threw
off
the
bird
which
even
rabican
could
not
equal
in
speed
the
huntsman
then
leapt
from
his
horse
and
the
animal
darted
after
rogero
with
the
swiftness
of
an
arrow
the
huntsman
also
ran
as
if
the
wind
or
fire
bore
him
and
the
dog
was
equal
to
rabican
in
swiftness
rogero
finding
flight
impossible
stopped
and
faced
his
pursuers
but
his
sword
was
useless
against
such
foes
the
insolent
huntsman
assailed
him
with
words
and
struck
him
with
his
whip
the
only
weapon
he
had
the
dog
bit
his
feet
and
the
horse
drove
at
him
with
his
hoofs
at
the
same
time
the
falcon
flew
over
his
head
and
over
rabican
and
attacked
them
with
claws
and
wings
so
that
the
horse
in
his
fright
began
to
be
unmanageable
at
that
moment
the
sound
of
trumpets
and
cymbals
was
heard
in
the
valley
and
it
was
evident
that
alcina
had
ordered
out
all
her
array
to
go
in
pursuit
rogero
felt
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
and
luckily
remembered
the
shield
of
atlantes
which
he
bore
suspended
from
his
neck
he
unveiled
it
and
the
charm
worked
wonderfully
the
huntsman
the
dog
the
horse
fell
flat
the
trembling
wings
of
the
falcon
could
no
longer
sustain
her
and
she
fell
senseless
to
the
ground
rogero
rid
of
their
annoyances
left
them
in
their
trance
and
rode
away
meanwhile
alcina
with
all
the
force
she
could
muster
sallied
forth
from
her
palace
in
pursuit
melissa
left
behind
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
ransack
all
the
rooms
protected
by
the
ring
she
undid
one
by
one
all
the
talismans
and
spells
which
she
found
broke
the
seals
burned
the
images
and
untied
the
hagknots
thence
hurrying
through
the
fields
she
disenchanted
the
victims
changed
into
trees
fountains
stones
or
brutes
all
of
whom
recovered
their
liberty
and
vowed
eternal
gratitude
to
their
deliverer
they
made
their
escape
with
all
possible
despatch
to
the
realms
of
the
good
logestilla
whence
they
departed
to
their
several
homes
astolpho
was
the
first
whom
melissa
liberated
for
rogero
had
particularly
recommended
him
to
her
care
she
aided
him
to
recover
his
arms
and
particularly
that
precious
lance
which
once
was
argalia
the
enchantress
mounted
with
him
upon
the
winged
horse
and
in
a
short
time
arrived
through
the
air
at
the
castle
of
logestilla
where
rogero
joined
them
soon
after
in
this
abode
the
friends
passed
a
short
period
of
delightful
and
improving
intercourse
with
the
sage
logestilla
and
her
virtuous
court
and
then
each
departed
rogero
with
the
hippogriff
ring
and
buckler
astolpho
with
his
golden
lance
and
mounted
on
rabican
the
fleetest
of
steeds
to
rogero
logestilla
gave
a
bit
and
bridle
suited
to
govern
the
hippogriff
and
to
astolpho
a
horn
of
marvellous
powers
to
be
sounded
only
when
all
other
weapons
were
unavailing
the
orc
we
left
the
charming
angelica
at
the
moment
when
in
her
flight
from
her
contending
lovers
sacripant
and
rinaldo
she
met
an
aged
hermit
we
have
seen
that
her
request
to
the
hermit
was
to
furnish
her
the
means
of
gaining
the
eager
to
avoid
rinaldo
whom
she
hated
by
leaving
france
and
europe
itself
the
pretended
hermit
who
was
no
other
than
a
vile
magician
knowing
well
that
it
would
not
be
agreeable
to
his
false
gods
to
aid
angelica
in
this
undertaking
feigned
to
comply
with
her
desire
he
supplied
her
a
horse
into
which
he
had
by
his
arts
caused
a
subtle
devil
to
enter
and
having
mounted
angelica
on
the
animal
directed
her
what
course
to
take
to
reach
the
sea
angelica
rode
on
her
way
without
suspicion
but
when
arrived
at
the
shore
the
demon
urged
the
animal
headlong
into
the
water
angelica
in
vain
attempted
to
turn
him
back
to
the
land
he
continued
his
course
till
as
night
approached
he
landed
with
his
burden
on
a
sandy
headland
angelica
finding
herself
alone
abandoned
in
this
frightful
solitude
remained
without
movement
as
if
stupefied
with
hands
joined
and
eyes
turned
towards
heaven
till
at
last
pouring
forth
a
torrent
of
tears
she
exclaimed
cruel
fortune
have
you
not
yet
exhausted
your
rage
against
me
to
what
new
miseries
do
you
doom
me
alas
then
finish
your
work
deliver
me
a
prey
to
some
ferocious
beast
or
by
whatever
fate
you
choose
bring
me
to
an
end
i
will
be
thankful
to
you
for
terminating
my
life
and
my
misery
at
last
exhausted
by
her
sorrows
she
fell
asleep
and
sunk
prostrate
on
the
sand
before
recounting
what
next
befell
we
must
declare
what
place
it
was
upon
which
the
unhappy
lady
was
now
thrown
in
the
sea
that
washes
the
coast
of
ireland
there
is
an
island
called
ebuda
whose
inhabitants
once
numerous
had
been
wasted
by
the
anger
of
proteus
till
there
were
now
but
few
left
this
deity
was
incensed
by
some
neglect
of
the
usual
honors
which
he
had
in
old
times
received
from
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
and
to
execute
his
vengeance
had
sent
a
horrid
called
an
orc
to
devour
them
such
were
the
terrors
of
his
ravages
that
the
whole
people
of
the
isle
had
shut
themselves
up
in
the
principal
town
and
relied
on
their
walls
alone
to
protect
them
in
this
distress
they
applied
to
the
oracle
for
advice
and
were
directed
to
appease
the
wrath
of
the
by
offering
to
him
the
fairest
virgin
that
the
country
could
produce
now
it
so
happened
that
the
very
day
when
this
dreadful
oracle
was
announced
and
when
the
fatal
mandate
had
gone
forth
to
seek
among
the
fairest
maidens
of
the
land
one
to
be
offered
to
the
monster
some
sailors
landing
on
the
beach
where
angelica
was
beheld
that
beauty
as
she
lay
asleep
o
blind
chance
whose
power
in
human
affairs
is
but
too
great
canst
thou
then
abandon
to
the
teeth
of
a
horrible
monster
those
charms
which
different
sovereigns
took
arms
against
one
another
to
possess
alas
the
lovely
angelica
is
destined
to
be
the
victim
of
those
cruel
islanders
still
asleep
she
was
bound
by
the
ebudians
and
it
was
not
until
she
was
carried
on
board
the
vessel
that
she
came
to
a
knowledge
of
her
situation
the
wind
filled
the
sails
and
wafted
the
ship
swiftly
to
the
port
where
all
that
beheld
her
agreed
that
she
was
unquestionably
the
victim
selected
by
proteus
himself
to
be
his
prey
who
can
tell
the
screams
the
mortal
anguish
of
this
unhappy
maiden
the
reproaches
she
addressed
even
to
the
heavens
themselves
when
the
dreadful
information
of
her
cruel
fate
was
made
known
to
her
i
can
not
let
me
rather
turn
to
a
happier
part
of
my
story
rogero
left
the
palace
of
logestilla
careering
on
his
flying
courser
far
above
the
tops
of
the
mountains
and
borne
westward
by
the
hippogriff
which
he
guided
with
ease
by
means
of
the
bridle
that
melissa
had
given
him
anxious
as
he
was
to
recover
bradamante
he
could
not
fail
to
be
delighted
at
the
view
his
rapid
flight
presented
of
so
many
vast
regions
and
populous
countries
as
he
passed
over
in
his
career
at
last
he
approached
the
shores
of
england
and
perceived
an
immense
army
in
all
the
splendor
of
military
pomp
as
if
about
to
go
forth
flushed
with
hopes
of
victory
he
caused
the
hippogriff
to
alight
not
far
from
the
scene
and
found
himself
immediately
surrounded
by
admiring
spectators
knights
and
soldiers
who
could
not
enough
indulge
their
curiosity
and
wonder
rogero
learned
in
reply
to
his
questions
that
the
fine
array
of
troops
before
him
was
the
army
destined
to
go
to
the
aid
of
the
french
emperor
in
compliance
with
the
request
presented
by
the
illustrious
rinaldo
as
ambassador
of
king
charles
his
uncle
by
this
time
the
curiosity
of
the
english
chevaliers
was
partly
gratified
in
beholding
the
hippogriff
at
rest
and
rogero
to
renew
their
surprise
and
delight
remounted
the
animal
and
slapping
spurs
to
his
sides
made
him
launch
into
the
air
with
the
rapidity
of
a
meteor
and
directed
his
flight
still
westwardly
till
he
came
within
sight
of
the
coasts
of
ireland
here
he
descried
what
seemed
to
be
a
fair
damsel
alone
fast
chained
to
a
rock
which
projected
into
the
sea
what
was
his
astonishment
when
drawing
nigh
he
beheld
the
beautiful
princess
angelica
that
day
she
had
been
led
forth
and
bound
to
the
rock
there
to
wait
till
the
should
come
to
devour
her
rogero
exclaimed
as
he
came
near
what
cruel
hands
what
barbarous
soul
what
fatal
chance
can
have
loaded
thee
with
those
chains
angelica
replied
by
a
torrent
of
tears
at
first
her
only
response
then
in
a
trembling
voice
she
disclosed
to
him
the
horrible
destiny
for
which
she
was
there
exposed
while
she
spoke
a
terrible
roaring
was
heard
far
off
on
the
sea
the
huge
monster
soon
came
in
sight
part
of
his
body
appearing
above
the
waves
and
part
concealed
angelica
half
dead
with
fear
abandoned
herself
to
despair
rogero
lance
in
rest
spurred
his
hippogriff
toward
the
orc
and
gave
him
a
thrust
the
horrible
monster
was
like
nothing
that
nature
produces
it
was
but
one
mass
of
tossing
and
twisting
body
with
nothing
of
the
animal
but
head
eyes
and
mouth
the
last
furnished
with
tusks
like
those
of
the
wild
boar
rogero
lance
had
struck
him
between
the
eyes
but
rock
and
iron
are
not
more
impenetrable
than
were
his
scales
the
knight
seeing
the
fruitlessness
of
the
first
blow
prepared
to
give
a
second
the
animal
beholding
upon
the
water
the
shadow
of
the
great
wings
of
the
hippogriff
abandoned
his
prey
and
turned
to
seize
what
seemed
nearer
rogero
took
the
opportunity
and
dealt
him
furious
blows
on
various
parts
of
his
body
taking
care
to
keep
clear
of
his
murderous
teeth
but
the
scales
resisted
every
attack
the
orc
beat
the
water
with
his
tail
till
he
raised
a
foam
which
enveloped
rogero
and
his
steed
so
that
the
knight
hardly
knew
whether
he
was
in
the
water
or
the
air
he
began
to
fear
that
the
wings
of
the
hippogriff
would
be
so
drenched
with
water
that
they
would
cease
to
sustain
him
at
that
moment
rogero
bethought
him
of
the
magic
shield
which
hung
at
his
but
the
fear
that
angelica
would
also
be
blinded
by
its
glare
discouraged
him
from
employing
it
then
he
remembered
the
ring
which
melissa
had
given
him
the
power
of
which
he
had
so
lately
proved
he
hastened
to
angelica
and
placed
it
on
her
finger
then
uncovering
the
buckler
he
turned
its
bright
disk
full
in
the
face
of
the
detestable
orc
the
effect
was
instantaneous
the
monster
deprived
of
sense
and
motion
rolled
over
on
the
sea
and
lay
floating
on
his
back
rogero
would
fain
have
tried
the
effect
of
his
lance
on
the
now
exposed
parts
but
angelica
implored
him
to
lose
no
time
in
delivering
her
from
her
chains
before
the
monster
should
revive
rogero
moved
with
her
entreaties
hastened
to
do
so
and
having
unbound
her
made
her
mount
behind
him
on
the
hippogriff
the
animal
spurning
the
earth
shot
up
into
the
air
and
rapidly
sped
his
way
through
it
rogero
to
give
time
to
the
princess
to
rest
after
her
cruel
agitations
soon
sought
the
earth
again
alighting
on
the
shore
of
brittany
near
the
shore
a
thick
wood
presented
itself
which
resounded
with
the
songs
of
birds
in
the
midst
a
fountain
of
transparent
water
bathed
the
turf
of
a
little
meadow
a
gentle
hill
rose
near
by
rogero
making
the
hippogriff
alight
in
the
meadow
dismounted
and
took
angelica
from
the
horse
when
the
first
tumults
of
emotion
had
subsided
angelica
casting
her
eyes
downward
beheld
the
precious
ring
upon
her
finger
whose
virtues
she
was
well
acquainted
with
for
it
was
the
very
ring
which
the
saracen
brunello
had
robbed
her
of
she
drew
it
from
her
finger
and
placed
it
in
her
mouth
and
quicker
than
we
can
tell
it
disappeared
from
the
sight
of
the
paladin
rogero
looked
around
him
on
all
sides
like
one
frantic
but
soon
remembered
the
ring
which
he
had
so
lately
placed
on
her
finger
struck
with
the
ingratitude
which
could
thus
recompense
his
services
he
exclaimed
thankless
beauty
is
this
then
the
reward
you
make
me
do
you
prefer
to
rob
me
of
my
ring
rather
than
receive
it
as
a
gift
willingly
would
i
have
given
it
to
you
had
you
but
asked
it
thus
he
said
searching
on
all
sides
with
arms
extended
like
a
blind
man
hoping
to
recover
by
the
touch
what
was
lost
to
sight
but
he
sought
in
vain
the
cruel
beauty
was
already
far
away
though
sensible
of
her
obligations
to
her
deliverer
her
first
necessity
was
for
clothing
food
and
repose
she
soon
reached
a
shepherd
hut
where
entering
unseen
she
found
what
sufficed
for
her
present
relief
an
old
herdsman
inhabited
the
hut
whose
charges
consisted
of
a
drove
of
mares
when
recruited
by
repose
angelica
selected
one
of
the
mares
from
the
flock
and
mounting
the
animal
felt
the
desire
revive
in
her
mind
of
returning
to
her
home
in
the
east
and
for
that
purpose
would
gladly
have
accepted
the
protection
of
orlando
or
of
sacripant
across
those
wide
regions
which
divided
her
from
her
own
country
in
hopes
of
meeting
with
one
or
the
other
of
them
she
pursued
her
way
meanwhile
rogero
despairing
of
seeing
angelica
again
returned
to
the
tree
where
he
had
left
his
winged
horse
but
had
the
mortification
to
find
that
the
animal
had
broken
his
bridle
and
escaped
this
loss
added
to
his
previous
disappointment
overwhelmed
him
with
vexation
sadly
he
gathered
up
his
arms
threw
his
buckler
over
his
shoulders
and
taking
the
first
path
that
offered
soon
found
himself
within
the
verge
of
a
dense
and
widespread
forest
he
had
proceeded
for
some
distance
when
he
heard
a
noise
on
his
right
and
listening
attentively
distinguished
the
clash
of
arms
he
made
his
way
toward
the
place
whence
the
sound
proceeded
and
found
two
warriors
engaged
in
mortal
combat
one
of
them
was
a
knight
of
a
noble
and
manly
bearing
the
other
a
fierce
giant
the
knight
appeared
to
exert
consummate
address
in
defending
herself
against
the
massive
club
of
the
giant
evading
his
strokes
or
parrying
them
with
sword
or
shield
rogero
stood
spectator
of
the
combat
for
he
did
not
allow
himself
to
interfere
in
it
though
a
secret
sentiment
inclined
him
strongly
to
take
part
with
the
knight
at
length
he
saw
with
grief
the
massive
club
fall
directly
on
the
head
of
the
knight
who
yielded
to
the
blow
and
fell
prostrate
the
giant
sprang
forward
to
despatch
him
and
for
that
purpose
unlaced
his
helmet
when
rogero
with
dismay
recognized
the
face
of
bradamante
he
cried
aloud
hold
miscreant
and
sprang
forward
with
drawn
sword
whereupon
the
giant
as
if
he
cared
not
to
enter
upon
another
combat
lifted
bradamante
on
his
shoulders
and
ran
with
her
into
the
forest
rogero
plunged
after
him
but
the
long
legs
of
the
giant
carried
him
forward
so
fast
that
the
paladin
could
hardly
keep
him
in
sight
at
length
they
issued
from
the
wood
and
rogero
perceived
before
him
a
rich
palace
built
of
marble
and
adorned
with
sculptures
executed
by
a
master
hand
into
this
edifice
through
a
golden
door
the
giant
passed
and
rogero
followed
but
on
looking
round
saw
nowhere
either
the
giant
or
bradamante
he
ran
from
room
to
room
calling
aloud
on
his
cowardly
foe
to
turn
and
meet
him
but
got
no
response
nor
caught
another
glimpse
of
the
giant
or
his
prey
in
his
vain
pursuit
he
met
without
knowing
them
ferrau
florismart
king
gradasso
orlando
and
many
others
all
of
whom
had
been
entrapped
like
himself
into
this
enchanted
castle
it
was
a
new
stratagem
of
the
magician
atlantes
to
draw
rogero
into
his
power
and
to
secure
also
those
who
might
by
any
chance
endanger
his
safety
what
rogero
had
taken
for
bradamante
was
a
mere
phantom
that
charming
lady
was
far
away
full
of
anxiety
for
her
rogero
whose
coming
she
had
long
expected
the
emperor
had
committed
to
her
charge
the
city
and
garrison
of
marseilles
and
she
held
the
post
against
the
infidels
with
valor
and
discretion
one
day
melissa
suddenly
presented
herself
before
her
anticipating
her
questions
she
said
fear
not
for
rogero
he
lives
and
is
as
ever
true
to
you
but
he
has
lost
his
liberty
the
fell
enchanter
has
again
succeeded
in
making
him
a
prisoner
if
you
would
deliver
him
mount
your
horse
and
follow
me
she
told
her
in
what
manner
atlantes
had
deceived
rogero
in
deluding
his
eyes
with
the
phantom
of
herself
in
peril
such
she
continued
will
be
his
arts
in
your
own
case
if
you
penetrate
the
forest
and
approach
that
castle
you
will
think
you
behold
rogero
when
in
fact
you
see
only
the
enchanter
himself
be
not
deceived
plunge
your
sword
into
his
body
and
trust
me
when
i
tell
you
that
in
slaying
him
you
will
restore
not
only
rogero
but
with
him
many
of
the
bravest
knights
of
france
whom
the
wizard
arts
have
withdrawn
from
the
camp
of
their
sovereign
bradamante
promptly
armed
herself
and
mounted
her
horse
melissa
led
her
by
forced
journeys
by
field
and
forest
beguiling
the
way
with
conversation
on
the
theme
which
interested
her
hearer
most
when
at
last
they
reached
the
forest
she
repeated
once
more
her
instructions
and
then
took
her
leave
for
fear
the
enchanter
might
espy
her
and
be
put
on
his
guard
bradamante
rode
on
about
two
miles
when
suddenly
she
beheld
rogero
as
it
appeared
to
her
hard
pressed
by
two
fierce
giants
while
she
hesitated
she
heard
his
voice
calling
on
her
for
help
at
once
the
cautions
of
melissa
lost
their
weight
a
sudden
doubt
of
the
faith
and
truth
of
her
kind
monitress
flashed
across
her
mind
shall
i
not
believe
my
own
eyes
and
ears
she
said
and
rushed
forward
to
his
defence
rogero
fled
pursued
by
the
giants
and
bradamante
followed
passing
with
them
through
the
castle
gate
when
there
bradamante
was
undeceived
for
neither
giant
nor
knight
was
to
be
seen
she
found
herself
a
prisoner
but
had
not
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
she
shared
the
imprisonment
of
her
beloved
she
saw
various
forms
of
men
and
women
but
could
recognize
none
of
them
and
their
lot
was
the
same
with
respect
to
her
each
viewed
the
others
under
some
illusion
of
the
fancy
wearing
the
semblance
of
giants
dwarfs
or
even
animals
so
that
there
was
no
companionship
or
communication
between
them
astolpho
adventures
continued
and
isabella
begun
when
astolpho
escaped
from
the
cruel
alcina
after
a
short
abode
in
the
realm
of
the
virtuous
logestilla
he
desired
to
return
to
his
native
country
logestilla
lent
him
the
best
vessel
of
her
fleet
to
convey
him
to
the
mainland
she
gave
him
at
parting
a
wonderful
book
which
taught
the
secret
of
overcoming
all
manners
of
enchantments
and
begged
him
to
carry
it
always
with
him
out
of
regard
for
her
she
also
gave
him
another
gift
which
surpassed
everything
of
the
kind
that
mortal
workmanship
can
frame
yet
it
was
nothing
in
appearance
but
a
simple
horn
astolpho
protected
by
these
gifts
thanked
the
good
fairy
took
leave
of
her
and
set
out
on
his
return
to
france
his
voyage
was
prosperous
and
on
reaching
the
desired
port
he
took
leave
of
the
faithful
mariners
and
continued
his
journey
by
land
as
he
proceeded
over
mountains
and
through
valleys
he
often
met
with
bands
of
robbers
wild
beasts
and
venomous
serpents
but
he
had
only
to
sound
his
horn
to
put
them
all
to
flight
having
landed
in
france
and
traversed
many
provinces
on
his
way
to
the
army
he
one
day
in
crossing
a
forest
arrived
beside
a
fountain
and
alighted
to
drink
while
he
stooped
at
the
fountain
a
young
rustic
sprang
from
the
copse
mounted
rabican
and
rode
away
it
was
a
new
trick
of
the
enchanter
atlantes
astolpho
hearing
the
noise
turned
his
head
just
in
time
to
see
his
loss
and
starting
up
pursued
the
thief
who
on
his
part
did
not
press
the
horse
to
his
full
speed
but
just
kept
in
sight
of
his
pursuer
till
they
both
issued
from
the
forest
and
then
rabican
and
his
rider
took
shelter
in
a
castle
which
stood
near
astolpho
followed
and
penetrated
without
difficulty
within
the
of
the
castle
where
he
looked
around
for
the
rider
and
his
horse
but
could
see
no
trace
of
either
nor
any
person
of
whom
he
could
make
inquiry
suspecting
that
enchantment
was
employed
to
embarrass
him
he
bethought
him
of
his
book
and
on
consulting
it
discovered
that
his
suspicions
were
well
founded
he
also
learned
what
course
to
pursue
he
was
directed
to
raise
the
stone
which
served
as
a
threshold
under
which
a
spirit
lay
pent
who
would
willingly
escape
and
leave
the
castle
free
of
access
astolpho
applied
his
strength
to
lift
aside
the
stone
thereupon
the
magician
put
his
arts
in
force
the
castle
was
full
of
prisoners
and
the
magician
caused
that
to
all
of
them
astolpho
should
appear
in
some
false
guise
to
some
a
wild
beast
to
others
a
giant
to
others
a
bird
of
prey
thus
all
assailed
him
and
would
quickly
have
made
an
end
of
him
if
he
had
not
bethought
him
of
his
horn
no
sooner
had
he
blown
a
blast
than
at
the
horrid
larum
fled
the
cavaliers
and
the
necromancer
with
them
like
a
flock
of
pigeons
at
the
sound
of
the
fowler
gun
astolpho
then
renewed
his
efforts
on
the
stone
and
turned
it
over
the
under
face
was
all
inscribed
with
magical
characters
which
the
knight
defaced
as
directed
by
his
book
and
no
sooner
had
he
done
so
than
the
castle
with
its
walls
and
turrets
vanished
into
smoke
the
knights
and
ladies
set
at
liberty
were
besides
rogero
and
bradamante
orlando
gradasso
florismart
and
many
more
at
the
sound
of
the
horn
they
fled
one
and
all
men
and
steeds
except
rabican
which
astolpho
secured
in
spite
of
his
terror
as
soon
as
the
sound
had
ceased
rogero
recognized
bradamante
whom
he
had
daily
met
during
their
imprisonment
but
had
been
prevented
from
knowing
by
the
enchanter
arts
no
words
can
tell
the
delight
with
which
they
recognized
each
other
and
recounted
mutually
all
that
had
happened
to
each
since
they
were
parted
rogero
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
press
his
suit
and
found
bradamante
as
propitious
as
he
could
wish
were
it
not
for
a
single
obstacle
the
difference
of
their
faiths
if
he
would
obtain
her
in
marriage
she
said
he
must
in
due
form
demand
her
of
her
father
duke
aymon
and
must
abandon
his
false
prophet
and
become
a
christian
the
latter
step
was
one
which
rogero
had
for
some
time
intended
taking
for
reasons
of
his
own
he
therefore
gladly
accepted
the
terms
and
proposed
that
they
should
at
once
repair
to
the
abbey
of
vallombrosa
whose
towers
were
visible
at
no
great
distance
thither
they
turned
their
horses
heads
and
we
will
leave
them
to
find
their
way
without
our
company
i
know
not
if
my
readers
recollect
that
at
the
moment
when
rogero
had
just
delivered
angelica
from
the
voracious
orc
that
scornful
beauty
placed
her
ring
in
her
mouth
and
vanished
out
of
sight
at
the
same
time
the
hippogriff
shook
off
his
bridle
soared
away
and
flew
to
rejoin
his
former
master
very
naturally
returning
to
his
accustomed
stable
here
astolpho
found
him
to
his
very
great
delight
he
knew
the
animal
powers
having
seen
rogero
ride
him
and
he
longed
to
fly
abroad
over
all
the
earth
and
see
various
nations
and
peoples
from
his
airy
course
he
had
heard
logestilla
directions
how
to
guide
the
animal
and
saw
her
fit
a
bridle
to
his
head
he
therefore
was
able
out
of
all
the
bridles
he
found
in
the
stable
to
select
one
suitable
and
placing
rabican
saddle
on
the
hippogriff
back
nothing
seemed
to
prevent
his
immediate
departure
yet
before
he
went
he
bethought
him
of
placing
rabican
in
hands
where
he
would
be
safe
and
whence
he
might
recover
him
in
time
of
need
while
he
stood
deliberating
where
he
should
find
a
messenger
he
saw
bradamante
approach
that
fair
warrior
had
been
parted
from
rogero
on
their
way
to
the
abbey
of
vallombrosa
by
an
inopportune
adventure
which
had
called
the
knight
away
she
was
now
returning
to
montalban
having
arranged
with
rogero
to
join
her
there
to
bradamante
therefore
his
fair
cousin
astolpho
committed
rabican
and
also
the
lance
of
gold
which
would
only
be
an
incumbrance
in
his
aerial
excursion
bradamante
took
charge
of
both
and
astolpho
bidding
her
farewell
soared
in
air
among
those
delivered
by
astolpho
from
the
magician
castle
was
orlando
following
the
guide
of
chance
the
paladin
found
himself
at
the
close
of
day
in
a
forest
and
stopped
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
surprised
to
discern
a
light
which
came
from
a
cleft
in
the
rock
he
approached
guided
by
the
ray
and
discovered
a
narrow
passage
in
the
which
led
into
a
deep
grotto
orlando
fastened
his
horse
and
then
putting
aside
the
bushes
that
resisted
his
passage
stepped
down
from
rock
to
rock
till
he
reached
a
sort
of
cavern
entering
it
he
perceived
a
lady
young
and
handsome
as
well
as
he
could
discover
through
the
signs
of
distress
which
agitated
her
countenance
her
only
companion
was
an
old
woman
who
seemed
to
be
regarded
by
her
young
partner
with
terror
and
indignation
the
courteous
paladin
saluted
the
women
respectfully
and
begged
to
know
by
whose
barbarity
they
had
been
subjected
to
such
imprisonment
the
younger
lady
replied
in
a
voice
often
broken
with
sobs
though
i
know
well
that
my
recital
will
subject
me
to
worse
treatment
by
the
barbarous
man
who
keeps
me
here
to
whom
this
woman
will
not
fail
to
report
it
yet
i
will
not
hide
from
you
the
facts
ah
why
should
i
fear
his
rage
if
he
should
take
my
life
i
know
not
what
better
boon
than
death
i
can
ask
my
name
is
isabella
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
galicia
or
rather
i
should
say
misfortune
and
grief
are
my
parents
young
rich
modest
and
of
tranquil
temper
all
things
appeared
to
combine
to
render
my
lot
happy
alas
i
see
myself
poor
humbled
miserable
and
destined
perhaps
to
yet
further
afflictions
it
is
a
year
since
my
father
having
given
notice
that
he
would
open
the
lists
for
a
tournament
at
bayonne
a
great
number
of
chevaliers
from
all
quarters
came
together
at
our
court
among
these
zerbino
son
of
the
king
of
scotland
victorious
in
all
combats
eclipsed
by
his
beauty
and
his
valor
all
the
rest
before
departing
from
the
court
of
galicia
he
testified
the
wish
to
espouse
me
and
i
consented
that
he
should
demand
my
hand
of
the
king
my
father
but
i
was
a
mahometan
and
zerbino
a
christian
and
my
father
refused
his
consent
the
prince
called
home
by
his
father
to
take
command
of
the
forces
destined
to
the
assistance
of
the
french
emperor
prevailed
on
me
to
be
married
to
him
secretly
and
to
follow
him
to
scotland
he
caused
a
galley
to
be
prepared
to
receive
me
and
placed
in
command
of
it
the
chevalier
oderic
a
biscayan
famous
for
his
exploits
both
by
land
and
sea
on
the
day
appointed
oderic
brought
his
vessel
to
a
seaside
resort
of
my
father
where
i
embarked
some
of
my
domestics
accompanied
me
and
thus
i
departed
from
my
native
land
sailing
with
a
fair
wind
after
some
hours
we
were
assailed
by
a
violent
tempest
it
was
to
no
purpose
that
we
took
in
all
sail
we
were
driven
before
the
wind
directly
upon
the
rocky
shore
seeing
no
other
hopes
of
safety
oderic
placed
me
in
a
boat
followed
himself
with
a
few
of
his
men
and
made
for
land
we
reached
it
through
infinite
peril
and
i
no
sooner
felt
the
firm
land
beneath
my
feet
than
i
knelt
down
and
poured
out
heartfelt
thanks
to
the
providence
that
had
preserved
me
the
shore
where
we
landed
appeared
to
be
uninhabited
we
saw
no
dwelling
to
shelter
us
no
road
to
lead
us
to
a
more
hospitable
spot
a
high
mountain
rose
before
us
whose
base
stretched
into
the
sea
it
was
here
the
infamous
oderic
in
spite
of
my
tears
and
entreaties
sold
me
to
a
band
of
pirates
who
fancied
i
might
be
an
acceptable
present
to
their
prince
the
sultan
of
morocco
this
cavern
is
their
den
and
here
they
keep
me
under
the
guard
of
this
woman
until
it
shall
suit
their
convenience
to
carry
me
away
isabella
had
hardly
finished
her
recital
when
a
troop
of
armed
men
began
to
enter
the
cavern
seeing
the
prince
orlando
one
said
to
the
rest
what
bird
is
this
we
have
caught
without
even
setting
a
snare
for
him
then
addressing
orlando
it
was
truly
civil
in
you
friend
to
come
hither
with
that
handsome
coat
of
armor
and
vest
the
very
things
i
want
you
shall
pay
for
them
then
said
orlando
and
seizing
a
brand
from
the
fire
he
hurled
it
at
him
striking
his
head
and
stretching
him
lifeless
on
the
floor
there
was
a
massy
table
in
the
middle
of
the
cavern
used
for
the
pirates
repasts
orlando
lifted
it
and
hurled
it
at
the
robbers
as
they
stood
clustered
in
a
group
toward
the
entrance
half
the
gang
were
laid
prostrate
with
broken
heads
and
limbs
the
rest
got
away
as
nimbly
as
they
could
leaving
the
den
and
its
inmates
to
their
fate
orlando
taking
isabella
under
his
protection
pursued
his
way
for
some
days
without
meeting
with
any
adventure
one
day
they
saw
a
band
of
men
advancing
who
seemed
to
be
guarding
a
prisoner
bound
hand
and
foot
as
if
being
carried
to
execution
the
prisoner
was
a
youthful
cavalier
of
a
noble
and
ingenuous
appearance
the
band
bore
the
ensigns
of
count
anselm
head
of
the
treacherous
house
of
maganza
orlando
desired
isabella
to
wait
while
he
rode
forward
to
inquire
the
meaning
of
this
array
approaching
he
demanded
of
the
leader
who
his
prisoner
was
and
of
what
crime
he
had
been
guilty
the
man
replied
that
the
prisoner
was
a
murderer
by
whose
hand
pinabel
the
son
of
count
anselm
had
been
treacherously
slain
at
these
words
the
prisoner
exclaimed
i
am
no
murderer
nor
have
i
been
in
any
way
the
cause
of
the
young
man
death
orlando
knowing
the
cruel
and
ferocious
character
of
the
chiefs
of
the
house
of
maganza
needed
no
more
to
satisfy
him
that
the
youth
was
the
victim
of
injustice
he
commanded
the
leader
of
the
troop
to
release
his
victim
and
receiving
an
insolent
reply
dashed
him
to
the
earth
with
a
stroke
of
his
lance
then
by
a
few
vigorous
blows
dispersed
the
band
leaving
deadly
marks
on
those
who
were
slowest
to
quit
the
field
orlando
then
hastened
to
unbind
the
prisoner
and
to
assist
him
to
reclothe
himself
in
his
armor
which
the
false
magencian
had
dared
to
assume
he
then
led
him
to
isabella
who
now
approached
the
scene
of
action
how
can
we
picture
the
joy
the
astonishment
with
which
isabella
recognized
in
him
zerbino
her
husband
and
the
prince
discovered
her
whom
he
had
believed
overwhelmed
in
the
waves
they
embraced
one
another
and
wept
for
joy
orlando
sharing
in
their
happiness
congratulated
himself
in
having
been
the
instrument
of
it
the
princess
recounted
to
zerbino
what
the
illustrious
paladin
had
done
for
her
and
the
prince
threw
himself
at
orlando
feet
and
thanked
him
as
having
twice
preserved
his
life
while
these
exchanges
of
congratulation
and
thankfulness
were
going
on
a
sound
in
the
underwood
attracted
their
attention
and
caused
the
two
knights
to
brace
their
helmets
and
stand
on
their
guard
what
the
cause
of
the
interruption
was
we
shall
record
in
another
chapter
medoro
france
was
at
this
time
the
theatre
of
dreadful
events
the
saracens
and
the
christians
in
numerous
encounters
slew
one
another
on
one
occasion
rinaldo
led
an
attack
on
the
infidel
columns
broke
and
scattered
them
till
he
found
himself
opposite
to
a
knight
whose
armor
whether
by
accident
or
by
choice
it
matters
not
bore
the
blazon
of
orlando
it
was
dardinel
the
young
and
brave
prince
of
zumara
and
rinaldo
remarked
him
by
the
slaughter
he
spread
all
around
ah
said
he
to
himself
let
us
pluck
up
this
dangerous
plant
before
it
has
grown
to
its
full
height
as
rinaldo
advanced
the
crowd
opened
before
him
the
christians
to
let
his
sword
have
free
course
the
pagans
to
escape
its
sweep
dardinel
and
he
stood
face
to
face
rinaldo
exclaimed
fiercely
young
man
whoever
gave
you
that
noble
buckler
to
bear
made
you
a
dangerous
gift
i
should
like
to
see
how
you
are
able
to
defend
those
quarterings
red
and
white
if
you
can
not
defend
them
against
me
how
pray
will
you
do
so
when
orlando
challenges
them
dardinel
replied
thou
shalt
learn
that
i
can
defend
the
arms
i
bear
and
shed
new
glory
upon
them
no
one
shall
rend
them
from
me
but
with
life
saying
these
words
dardinel
rushed
upon
rinaldo
with
sword
uplifted
the
chill
of
mortal
terror
filled
the
souls
of
the
saracens
when
they
beheld
rinaldo
advance
to
attack
the
prince
like
a
lion
against
a
young
bull
the
first
blow
came
from
the
hand
of
dardinel
and
the
weapon
rebounded
from
mambrino
helmet
without
effect
rinaldo
smiled
and
said
i
will
now
show
you
if
my
strokes
are
more
effectual
at
these
words
he
thrust
the
unfortunate
dardinel
in
the
middle
of
his
breast
the
blow
was
so
violent
that
the
cruel
weapon
pierced
the
body
and
came
out
a
behind
his
back
through
this
wound
the
life
of
dardinel
issued
with
his
blood
and
his
body
fell
helpless
to
the
ground
as
a
flower
which
the
passing
plough
has
uprooted
languishes
and
droops
its
head
so
dardinel
his
visage
covered
with
the
paleness
of
death
expires
and
the
hopes
of
an
illustrious
race
perish
with
him
like
waters
kept
back
by
a
dike
which
when
the
dike
is
broken
spread
abroad
through
all
the
country
so
the
moors
no
longer
kept
in
column
by
the
example
of
dardinel
fled
in
all
directions
rinaldo
despised
too
much
such
easy
victories
to
pursue
them
he
wished
for
no
combats
but
with
brave
men
at
the
same
time
the
other
paladins
made
terrible
slaughter
of
the
moors
charles
himself
oliver
guido
and
ogier
the
dane
carried
death
into
their
ranks
on
all
sides
the
infidels
seemed
doomed
to
perish
to
a
man
on
that
dreadful
day
but
the
wise
king
marsilius
at
last
put
some
slight
degree
of
method
into
the
general
rout
he
collected
the
remnant
of
the
troops
formed
them
into
a
battalion
and
retreated
in
tolerable
order
to
his
camp
that
camp
was
well
fortified
by
intrenchments
and
a
broad
ditch
thither
the
fugitives
hastened
and
by
degrees
all
that
remained
of
the
moorish
army
was
brought
together
there
the
emperor
might
perhaps
that
night
have
crushed
his
enemy
entirely
but
not
thinking
it
prudent
to
expose
his
troops
fatigued
as
they
were
to
an
attack
upon
a
camp
so
well
fortified
he
contented
himself
with
encompassing
the
enemy
with
his
troops
prepared
to
make
a
regular
siege
during
the
night
the
moors
had
time
to
see
the
extent
of
their
loss
their
tents
resounded
with
lamentations
this
warrior
had
to
mourn
a
brother
that
a
friend
many
suffered
with
grievous
wounds
all
trembled
at
the
fate
in
store
for
them
there
were
two
young
moors
both
of
humble
rank
who
gave
proof
at
that
time
of
attachment
and
fidelity
rare
in
the
history
of
man
cloridan
and
medoro
had
followed
their
prince
dardinel
to
the
wars
of
france
cloridan
a
bold
huntsman
combined
strength
with
activity
medoro
was
a
mere
youth
his
cheeks
yet
fair
and
blooming
of
all
the
saracens
no
one
united
so
much
grace
and
beauty
his
light
hair
was
set
off
by
his
black
and
sparkling
eyes
the
two
friends
were
together
on
guard
at
the
rampart
about
midnight
they
gazed
on
the
scene
in
deep
dejection
medoro
with
tears
in
his
eyes
spoke
of
the
good
prince
dardinel
and
could
not
endure
the
thought
that
his
body
should
be
cast
out
on
the
plain
deprived
of
funeral
honors
o
my
friend
said
he
must
then
the
body
of
our
prince
be
the
prey
of
wolves
and
ravens
alas
when
i
remember
how
he
loved
me
i
feel
that
if
i
should
sacrifice
my
life
to
do
him
honor
i
should
not
do
more
than
my
duty
i
wish
dear
friend
to
seek
out
his
body
on
the
battlefield
and
give
it
burial
and
i
hope
to
be
able
to
pass
through
king
charles
camp
without
discovery
as
they
are
probably
all
asleep
you
cloridan
will
be
able
to
say
for
me
if
i
should
die
in
the
adventure
that
gratitude
and
fidelity
to
my
prince
were
my
inducements
cloridan
was
both
surprised
and
touched
with
this
proof
of
the
young
man
devotion
he
loved
him
tenderly
and
tried
for
a
long
time
every
effort
to
dissuade
him
from
his
design
but
he
found
medoro
determined
to
accomplish
his
object
or
die
in
the
endeavor
cloridan
unable
to
change
his
purpose
said
i
will
go
with
you
medoro
and
help
you
in
this
generous
enterprise
i
value
not
life
compared
with
honor
and
if
i
did
do
you
suppose
dear
friend
that
i
could
live
without
you
i
would
rather
fall
by
the
arms
of
our
enemies
than
die
of
grief
for
the
loss
of
you
when
the
two
friends
were
relieved
from
their
guard
duty
they
went
without
any
followers
into
the
camp
of
the
christians
all
there
was
still
the
fires
were
dying
out
there
was
no
fear
of
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
saracens
and
the
soldiers
overcome
by
fatigue
or
wine
slept
secure
lying
upon
the
ground
in
the
midst
of
their
arms
and
equipage
cloridan
stopped
and
said
medoro
i
am
not
going
to
quit
this
camp
without
taking
vengeance
for
the
death
of
our
prince
keep
watch
be
on
your
guard
that
no
one
shall
surprise
us
i
mean
to
mark
a
road
with
my
sword
through
the
ranks
of
our
enemies
so
saying
he
entered
the
tent
where
alpheus
slept
who
a
year
before
had
joined
the
camp
of
charles
and
pretended
to
be
a
great
physician
and
astrologer
but
his
science
had
deceived
him
if
it
gave
him
hope
of
dying
peacefully
in
his
bed
at
a
good
old
age
his
lot
was
to
die
with
little
warning
cloridan
ran
his
sword
through
his
heart
a
greek
and
a
german
followed
who
had
been
playing
late
at
dice
fortunate
if
they
had
continued
their
game
a
little
longer
but
they
never
reckoned
a
throw
like
this
among
their
chances
cloridan
next
came
to
the
unlucky
grillon
whose
head
lay
softly
on
his
pillow
he
dreamed
probably
of
the
feast
from
which
he
had
but
just
retired
for
when
cloridan
cut
off
his
head
wine
flowed
forth
with
the
blood
the
two
young
moors
might
have
penetrated
even
to
the
tent
of
charlemagne
but
knowing
that
the
paladins
encamped
around
him
kept
watch
by
turns
and
judging
that
it
was
impossible
they
should
all
be
asleep
they
were
afraid
to
go
too
near
they
might
also
have
obtained
rich
booty
but
intent
only
on
their
object
they
crossed
the
camp
and
arrived
at
length
at
the
bloody
field
where
bucklers
lances
and
swords
lay
scattered
in
the
midst
of
corpses
of
poor
and
rich
common
soldier
and
prince
horses
and
pools
of
blood
this
terrible
scene
of
carnage
would
have
destroyed
all
hope
of
finding
what
they
were
in
search
of
until
dawn
of
day
were
it
not
that
the
moon
lent
the
aid
of
her
uncertain
rays
medoro
raised
his
eyes
to
the
planet
and
exclaimed
o
holy
goddess
whom
our
fathers
have
adored
under
three
different
forms
thou
who
displayest
thy
power
in
heaven
on
earth
and
in
the
underworld
thou
who
art
seen
foremost
among
the
nymphs
chasing
the
beasts
of
the
forest
cause
me
to
see
i
implore
thee
the
spot
where
my
dear
master
lies
and
make
me
all
my
life
long
follow
the
example
which
thou
dost
exhibit
of
works
of
charity
and
love
either
by
accident
or
that
the
moon
was
sensible
of
the
prayer
of
medoro
the
cloud
broke
away
and
the
moonlight
burst
forth
as
bright
as
day
the
rays
seemed
especially
to
gild
the
spot
where
lay
the
body
of
prince
dardinel
and
medoro
bathed
in
tears
and
with
bleeding
heart
recognized
him
by
the
quarterings
of
red
and
white
on
his
shield
with
groans
stifled
by
his
tears
and
lamentations
in
accents
suppressed
not
from
any
fear
for
himself
for
he
cared
not
for
life
but
lest
any
one
should
be
roused
to
interrupt
their
pious
duty
while
yet
incomplete
he
proposed
to
his
companion
that
they
should
together
bear
dardinel
on
their
shoulders
sharing
the
burden
of
the
beloved
remains
marching
with
rapid
strides
under
their
precious
load
they
perceived
that
the
stars
began
to
grow
pale
and
that
the
shades
of
night
would
soon
be
dispersed
by
the
dawn
just
then
zerbino
whose
extreme
valor
had
urged
him
far
from
the
camp
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitives
returning
entered
the
wood
in
which
they
were
some
knights
in
his
train
perceived
at
a
distance
the
two
cloridan
saw
the
troop
and
observing
that
they
dispersed
themselves
over
the
plain
as
if
in
search
of
booty
told
medoro
to
lay
down
the
body
and
let
each
save
himself
by
flight
he
dropped
his
part
thinking
that
medoro
would
do
the
same
but
the
good
youth
loved
his
prince
too
well
to
abandon
him
and
continued
to
carry
his
load
singly
as
well
as
he
might
while
cloridan
made
his
escape
near
by
there
was
a
part
of
the
wood
tufted
as
if
nothing
but
wild
animals
had
ever
penetrated
it
the
unfortunate
youth
loaded
with
the
weight
of
his
dead
master
plunged
into
its
recesses
cloridan
when
he
perceived
that
he
had
evaded
his
foes
discovered
that
medoro
was
not
with
him
ah
exclaimed
he
how
could
i
dear
medoro
so
forget
myself
as
to
consult
my
own
safety
without
heeding
yours
so
saying
he
retraced
the
tangled
passes
of
the
wood
toward
the
place
from
whence
he
had
fled
as
he
approached
he
heard
the
noise
of
horses
and
the
menacing
voices
of
armed
men
soon
he
perceived
medoro
on
foot
with
the
cavaliers
surrounding
him
zerbino
their
commander
bade
them
seize
him
the
unhappy
medoro
turned
now
this
way
now
that
trying
to
conceal
himself
behind
an
oak
or
a
rock
still
bearing
the
body
which
he
would
by
no
means
leave
cloridan
not
knowing
how
to
help
him
but
resolved
to
perish
with
him
if
he
must
perish
takes
an
arrow
fits
it
to
his
bow
discharges
it
and
pierces
the
breast
of
a
christian
knight
who
falls
helpless
from
his
horse
the
others
look
this
way
and
that
to
discover
whence
the
fatal
bolt
was
sped
one
while
demanding
of
his
comrades
in
what
direction
the
arrow
came
received
a
second
in
his
throat
which
stopped
his
words
and
soon
closed
his
eyes
to
the
scene
zerbino
furious
at
the
death
of
his
two
comrades
ran
upon
medoro
seized
his
golden
hair
and
dragged
him
forward
to
slay
him
but
the
sight
of
so
much
youth
and
beauty
commanded
pity
he
stayed
his
arm
the
young
man
spoke
in
suppliant
tones
ah
signor
said
he
i
conjure
you
by
the
god
whom
you
serve
deprive
me
not
of
life
until
i
shall
have
buried
the
body
of
the
prince
my
master
fear
not
that
i
will
ask
you
any
other
favor
life
is
not
dear
to
me
i
desire
death
as
soon
as
i
shall
have
performed
this
sacred
duty
do
with
me
then
as
you
please
give
my
limbs
a
prey
to
the
birds
and
beasts
only
let
me
first
bury
my
prince
medoro
pronounced
these
words
with
an
air
so
sweet
and
tender
that
a
heart
of
stone
would
have
been
moved
by
them
zerbino
was
so
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
he
was
on
the
point
of
uttering
words
of
mercy
when
a
cruel
subaltern
forgetting
all
respect
to
his
commander
plunged
his
lance
into
the
breast
of
the
young
moor
zerbino
enraged
at
his
brutality
turned
upon
the
wretch
to
take
vengeance
but
he
saved
himself
by
a
precipitate
flight
cloridan
who
saw
medoro
fall
could
contain
himself
no
longer
he
rushed
from
his
concealment
threw
down
his
bow
and
sword
in
hand
seemed
only
desirous
of
vengeance
for
medoro
and
to
die
with
him
in
a
moment
pierced
through
and
through
with
many
wounds
he
exerts
the
last
remnant
of
his
strength
in
dragging
himself
to
medoro
to
die
embracing
him
the
cavaliers
left
them
thus
to
rejoin
zerbino
whose
rage
against
the
murderer
of
medoro
had
drawn
him
away
from
the
spot
cloridan
died
and
medoro
bleeding
copiously
was
drawing
near
his
end
when
help
arrived
a
young
maiden
approached
the
fallen
knights
at
this
critical
moment
her
dress
was
that
of
a
but
her
air
was
noble
and
her
beauty
celestial
sweetness
and
goodness
reigned
in
her
lovely
countenance
it
was
no
other
than
angelica
the
princess
of
cathay
when
she
had
recovered
that
precious
ring
as
we
have
before
related
angelica
knowing
its
value
felt
proud
in
the
power
it
conferred
travelled
alone
without
fear
not
without
a
secret
shame
that
she
had
ever
been
obliged
to
seek
protection
in
her
wanderings
of
the
count
orlando
and
of
sacripant
she
reproached
herself
too
as
with
a
weakness
that
she
had
ever
thought
of
marrying
rinaldo
in
fine
her
pride
grew
so
high
as
to
persuade
her
that
no
man
living
was
worthy
to
aspire
to
her
hand
moved
with
pity
at
the
sight
of
the
young
man
wounded
and
melted
to
tears
at
hearing
the
cause
she
quickly
recalled
to
remembrance
the
knowledge
she
had
acquired
in
india
where
the
virtues
of
plants
and
the
art
of
healing
formed
part
of
the
education
even
of
princesses
the
beautiful
queen
ran
into
the
adjoining
meadow
to
gather
plants
of
virtue
to
staunch
the
flow
of
blood
meeting
on
her
way
a
countryman
on
horseback
seeking
a
strayed
heifer
she
begged
him
to
come
to
her
assistance
and
endeavor
to
remove
the
wounded
man
to
a
more
secure
asylum
angelica
having
prepared
the
plants
by
bruising
them
between
two
stones
laid
them
with
her
fair
hand
on
medoro
wound
the
remedy
soon
restored
in
some
degree
the
strength
of
the
wounded
man
who
before
he
would
quit
the
spot
made
them
cover
with
earth
and
turf
the
bodies
of
his
friend
and
of
the
prince
then
surrendering
himself
to
the
pity
of
his
deliverers
he
allowed
them
to
place
him
on
the
horse
of
the
shepherd
and
conduct
him
to
his
cottage
it
was
a
pleasant
farmhouse
on
the
borders
of
the
wood
bearing
marks
of
comfort
and
competency
there
the
shepherd
lived
with
his
wife
and
children
there
angelica
tended
medoro
and
there
by
the
devoted
care
of
the
beautiful
queen
his
sad
wound
closed
over
and
he
recovered
his
perfect
health
o
count
rinaldo
o
king
sacripant
what
availed
it
you
to
possess
so
many
virtues
and
such
fame
what
advantage
have
you
derived
from
all
your
high
deserts
o
hapless
king
great
agrican
if
you
could
return
to
life
how
would
you
endure
to
see
yourself
rejected
by
one
who
will
bow
to
the
yoke
of
hymen
in
favor
of
a
young
soldier
of
humble
birth
and
thou
ferrau
and
ye
numerous
others
who
a
hundred
times
have
put
your
lives
at
hazard
for
this
cruel
beauty
how
bitter
will
it
be
to
you
to
see
her
sacrifice
you
all
to
the
claims
of
the
humble
medoro
there
under
the
low
roof
of
a
shepherd
the
flame
of
hymen
was
lighted
for
this
haughty
queen
she
takes
the
shepherd
wife
to
serve
in
place
of
mother
the
shepherd
and
his
children
for
witnesses
and
marries
the
happy
medoro
angelica
after
her
marriage
wishing
to
endow
medoro
with
the
sovereignty
of
the
countries
which
yet
remained
to
her
took
with
him
the
road
to
the
east
she
had
preserved
through
all
her
adventures
a
bracelet
of
gold
enriched
with
precious
stones
the
present
of
the
count
orlando
having
nothing
else
wherewith
to
reward
the
good
shepherd
and
his
wife
who
had
served
her
with
so
much
care
and
fidelity
she
took
the
bracelet
from
her
arm
and
gave
it
to
them
and
then
the
couple
directed
their
steps
toward
those
mountains
which
separate
france
and
spain
intending
to
wait
at
barcelona
a
vessel
which
should
take
them
on
their
way
to
the
east
orlando
mad
orlando
on
the
loss
of
angelica
laid
aside
his
crest
and
arms
and
arrayed
himself
in
a
suit
of
black
armor
expressive
of
his
despair
in
this
guise
he
carried
such
slaughter
among
the
ranks
of
the
infidels
that
both
armies
were
astonished
at
the
achievements
of
the
stranger
knight
mandricardo
who
had
been
absent
from
the
battle
heard
the
report
of
these
achievements
and
determined
to
test
for
himself
the
valor
of
the
knight
so
extolled
he
it
was
who
broke
in
upon
the
conference
of
zerbino
and
isabella
and
their
benefactor
orlando
as
they
stood
occupied
in
mutual
felicitations
after
the
happy
reunion
of
the
lovers
by
the
prowess
of
the
paladin
mandricardo
after
contemplating
the
group
for
a
moment
addressed
himself
to
orlando
in
these
words
thou
must
be
the
man
i
seek
for
ten
days
and
more
i
have
been
on
thy
track
the
fame
of
thy
exploits
has
brought
me
hither
that
i
may
measure
my
strength
with
thine
thy
crest
and
shield
prove
thee
the
same
who
spread
such
slaughter
among
our
troops
but
these
marks
are
superfluous
and
if
i
saw
thee
among
a
hundred
i
should
know
thee
by
thy
martial
bearing
to
be
the
man
i
seek
i
respect
thy
courage
said
orlando
such
a
design
could
not
have
sprung
up
in
any
but
a
brave
and
generous
soul
if
the
desire
to
see
me
has
brought
thee
hither
i
would
if
it
were
possible
show
thee
my
inmost
soul
i
will
remove
my
visor
that
you
may
satisfy
your
curiosity
but
when
you
have
done
so
i
hope
that
you
will
also
try
and
see
if
my
valor
corresponds
to
my
appearance
come
on
said
the
saracen
my
first
wish
was
to
see
and
know
thee
i
will
not
gratify
my
second
orlando
observing
mandricardo
was
surprised
to
see
no
sword
at
his
side
nor
mace
at
his
and
what
weapon
hast
thou
said
he
if
thy
lance
fail
thee
do
not
concern
yourself
about
that
said
mandricardo
i
have
made
many
good
knights
give
ground
with
no
other
weapon
than
you
see
know
that
i
have
sworn
an
oath
never
to
bear
a
sword
until
i
win
back
that
famous
durindana
that
orlando
the
paladin
carries
that
sword
belongs
to
the
suit
of
armor
which
i
wear
that
only
is
wanting
without
doubt
it
was
stolen
but
how
it
got
into
the
hands
of
orlando
i
know
not
but
i
will
make
him
pay
dearly
for
it
when
i
find
him
i
seek
him
the
more
anxiously
that
i
may
avenge
with
his
blood
the
death
of
king
agrican
my
father
whom
he
treacherously
slew
i
am
sure
he
must
have
done
it
by
treachery
for
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
subdue
in
fair
fight
such
a
warrior
as
my
father
thou
liest
cried
orlando
and
all
who
say
so
lie
i
am
orlando
whom
you
seek
yes
i
am
he
who
slew
your
father
honorably
hold
here
is
the
sword
you
shall
have
it
if
your
courage
avails
to
merit
it
though
it
belongs
to
me
by
right
i
will
not
use
it
in
this
dispute
see
i
hang
it
on
this
tree
you
shall
be
master
of
it
if
you
bereave
me
of
life
not
else
at
these
words
orlando
drew
durindana
and
hung
it
on
one
of
the
branches
of
a
tree
near
by
both
knights
boiling
with
equal
ardor
rode
off
in
a
semicircle
then
rushed
together
with
reins
thrown
loose
and
struck
one
another
with
their
lances
both
kept
their
seats
immovable
the
splinters
of
their
lances
flew
into
the
air
and
no
weapon
remained
for
either
but
the
fragment
which
he
held
in
his
hand
then
those
two
knights
covered
with
iron
mail
were
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
fighting
with
staves
in
the
manner
of
two
rustics
who
dispute
the
boundary
of
a
meadow
or
the
possession
of
a
spring
these
clubs
could
not
long
keep
whole
in
the
hands
of
such
sturdy
smiters
who
were
soon
reduced
to
fight
with
naked
fists
such
warfare
was
more
painful
to
him
that
gave
than
to
him
that
received
the
blows
they
next
clasped
and
strained
each
his
adversary
as
hercules
did
antaeus
mandricardo
more
enraged
than
orlando
made
violent
efforts
to
unseat
the
paladin
and
dropped
the
rein
of
his
horse
orlando
more
calm
perceived
it
with
one
hand
he
resisted
mandricardo
with
the
other
he
twitched
the
horse
bridle
over
the
ears
of
the
animal
the
saracen
dragged
orlando
with
all
his
might
but
orlando
thighs
held
the
saddle
like
a
vise
at
last
the
efforts
of
the
saracen
broke
the
girths
of
orlando
horse
the
saddle
slipped
the
knight
firm
in
his
stirrups
slipped
with
it
and
came
to
the
ground
hardly
conscious
of
his
fall
the
noise
of
his
armor
in
falling
startled
horse
now
without
a
bridle
he
started
off
in
full
career
heeding
neither
trees
nor
rocks
nor
broken
ground
urged
by
fright
he
ran
with
furious
speed
carrying
his
master
who
almost
distracted
with
rage
shouted
and
beat
the
animal
with
his
fists
and
thereby
impelled
his
flight
after
running
thus
three
miles
or
more
a
deep
ditch
opposed
their
progress
the
horse
and
rider
fell
headlong
into
it
and
did
not
find
the
bottom
covered
with
or
roses
they
got
sadly
bruised
but
were
lucky
enough
to
escape
without
any
broken
limbs
mandricardo
as
soon
as
he
gained
his
feet
seized
the
horse
by
his
mane
with
fury
but
having
no
bridle
could
not
hold
him
he
looked
round
in
hopes
of
finding
something
that
would
do
for
a
rein
just
then
fortune
who
seemed
willing
to
help
him
at
last
brought
that
way
a
peasant
with
a
bridle
in
his
hand
who
was
in
search
of
his
farm
horse
that
had
strayed
away
orlando
having
speedily
repaired
his
horse
girths
remounted
and
waited
a
good
hour
for
the
saracen
to
return
not
seeing
him
he
concluded
to
go
in
search
of
him
he
took
an
affectionate
leave
of
zerbino
and
isabella
who
would
willingly
have
followed
him
but
this
the
brave
paladin
would
by
no
means
permit
he
held
it
unknightly
to
go
in
search
of
an
enemy
accompanied
by
a
friend
who
might
act
as
a
defender
therefore
desiring
them
to
say
to
mandricardo
if
they
should
meet
him
that
his
purpose
was
to
tarry
in
the
neighborhood
three
days
and
then
repair
to
the
camp
of
charlemagne
he
took
down
durindana
from
the
tree
and
proceeded
in
the
direction
which
the
saracen
horse
had
taken
but
the
animal
having
no
guide
but
its
terror
had
so
doubled
and
confused
its
traces
that
orlando
after
two
days
spent
in
the
search
gave
up
the
attempt
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
third
day
when
the
paladin
arrived
on
the
pleasant
bank
of
a
stream
which
wound
through
a
meadow
enamelled
with
flowers
high
trees
whose
tops
met
and
formed
an
arbor
the
fountain
and
the
breeze
which
blew
through
their
foliage
tempered
the
heat
hither
the
shepherds
used
to
resort
to
quench
their
thirst
and
to
enjoy
the
shelter
from
the
midday
sun
the
air
perfumed
with
the
flowers
seemed
to
breathe
fresh
strength
into
their
veins
orlando
felt
the
influence
though
covered
with
his
armor
he
stopped
in
this
delicious
arbor
where
everything
seemed
to
invite
to
repose
but
he
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
fatal
asylum
he
there
spent
the
most
miserable
moments
of
his
life
he
looked
around
and
noted
with
pleasure
all
the
charms
of
the
spot
he
saw
that
some
of
the
trees
were
carved
with
inscriptions
he
drew
near
and
read
them
and
what
was
his
surprise
to
find
that
they
composed
the
name
of
angelica
farther
on
he
found
the
name
of
medoro
mixed
with
hers
the
paladin
thought
he
dreamed
he
stood
like
one
amazed
like
a
bird
that
rising
to
fly
finds
its
feet
caught
in
a
net
orlando
followed
the
course
of
the
stream
and
came
to
one
of
its
turns
where
the
rocks
of
the
mountain
bent
in
such
a
way
as
to
form
a
sort
of
grotto
the
twisted
stems
of
ivy
and
the
wild
vine
draped
the
entrance
of
this
recess
scooped
by
the
hand
of
nature
the
unhappy
paladin
on
entering
the
grotto
saw
letters
which
appeared
to
have
been
lately
carved
they
were
verses
which
medoro
had
written
in
honor
of
his
happy
nuptials
with
the
beautiful
queen
orlando
tried
to
persuade
himself
it
must
be
some
other
angelica
whom
those
verses
celebrated
and
as
for
medoro
he
had
never
heard
his
name
the
sun
was
now
declining
and
orlando
remounted
his
horse
and
went
on
his
way
he
soon
saw
the
roof
of
a
cottage
whence
the
smoke
ascended
he
heard
the
barking
of
dogs
and
the
lowing
of
cattle
and
arrived
at
a
humble
dwelling
which
seemed
to
offer
an
asylum
for
the
night
the
inmates
as
soon
as
they
saw
him
hastened
to
tender
him
service
one
took
his
horse
another
his
shield
and
cuirass
another
his
golden
spurs
this
cottage
was
the
very
same
where
medoro
had
been
carried
deeply
wounded
where
angelica
had
tended
him
and
afterwards
married
him
the
shepherd
who
lived
in
it
loved
to
tell
everybody
the
story
of
this
marriage
and
soon
related
it
with
all
its
details
to
the
miserable
orlando
having
finished
it
he
went
away
and
returned
with
the
precious
bracelet
which
angelica
grateful
for
his
services
had
given
him
as
a
memorial
it
was
the
one
which
orlando
had
himself
given
her
this
last
touch
was
the
finishing
stroke
to
the
excited
paladin
frantic
exasperated
he
exclaimed
against
the
ungrateful
and
cruel
princess
who
had
disdained
him
the
most
renowned
the
most
indomitable
of
all
the
paladins
of
france
him
who
had
rescued
her
from
the
most
alarming
perils
him
who
had
fought
the
most
terrible
battles
for
her
sake
she
to
prefer
to
him
a
young
saracen
the
pride
of
the
noble
count
was
deeply
wounded
indignant
frantic
a
victim
to
ungovernable
rage
he
rushed
into
the
forest
uttering
the
most
frightful
shrieks
no
no
cried
he
i
am
not
the
man
they
take
me
for
orlando
is
dead
i
am
only
the
wandering
ghost
of
that
unhappy
count
who
is
now
suffering
the
torments
of
hell
orlando
wandered
all
night
as
chance
directed
through
the
wood
and
at
sunrise
his
destiny
led
him
to
the
fountain
where
medoro
had
engraved
the
fatal
inscription
the
frantic
paladin
saw
it
a
second
time
with
fury
drew
his
sword
and
hacked
it
from
the
rock
unlucky
grotto
you
shall
no
more
attract
by
your
shade
and
coolness
you
shall
no
more
shelter
with
your
arch
either
shepherd
or
flock
and
you
fresh
and
pure
fountain
you
may
not
escape
the
rage
of
the
furious
orlando
he
cast
into
the
fountain
branches
trunks
of
trees
which
he
tore
up
pieces
of
rocks
which
he
broke
off
plants
uprooted
with
the
earth
adhering
and
turf
and
brushes
so
as
to
choke
the
fountain
and
destroy
the
purity
of
its
waters
at
length
exhausted
by
his
violent
exertions
bathed
in
sweat
breathless
orlando
sunk
panting
upon
the
earth
and
lay
there
insensible
three
days
and
three
nights
the
fourth
day
he
started
up
and
seized
his
arms
his
helmet
his
buckler
he
cast
far
from
him
his
hauberk
and
his
clothes
he
rent
asunder
the
fragments
were
scattered
through
the
wood
in
fine
he
became
a
furious
madman
his
insanity
was
such
that
he
cared
not
to
retain
even
his
sword
but
he
had
no
need
of
durindana
nor
of
other
arms
to
do
wonderful
things
his
prodigious
strength
sufficed
at
the
first
wrench
of
his
mighty
arm
he
tore
up
a
by
the
roots
oaks
beeches
maples
whatever
he
met
in
his
path
yielded
in
like
manner
the
ancient
forest
soon
became
as
bare
as
the
borders
of
a
morass
where
the
fowler
has
cleared
away
the
bushes
to
spread
his
nets
the
shepherds
hearing
the
horrible
crashing
in
the
forest
abandoned
their
flocks
to
run
and
see
the
cause
of
this
unwonted
uproar
by
their
evil
star
or
for
their
sins
they
were
led
thither
when
they
saw
the
furious
state
the
count
was
in
and
his
incredible
force
they
would
fain
have
fled
out
of
his
reach
but
in
their
fears
lost
their
presence
of
mind
the
madman
pursued
them
seized
one
and
rent
him
limb
from
limb
as
easily
as
one
would
pull
ripe
apples
from
a
tree
he
took
another
by
the
feet
and
used
him
as
a
club
to
knock
down
a
third
the
shepherds
fled
but
it
would
have
been
hard
for
any
to
escape
if
he
had
not
at
that
moment
left
them
to
throw
himself
with
the
same
fury
upon
their
flocks
the
peasants
abandoning
their
ploughs
and
harrows
mounted
on
the
roofs
of
buildings
and
pinnacles
of
the
rocks
afraid
to
trust
themselves
even
to
the
oaks
and
pines
from
such
heights
they
looked
on
trembling
at
the
raging
fury
of
the
unhappy
orlando
his
fists
his
teeth
his
nails
his
feet
seize
break
and
tear
cattle
sheep
and
swine
the
most
swift
in
flight
alone
being
able
to
escape
him
when
at
last
terror
had
scattered
everything
before
him
he
entered
a
cottage
which
was
abandoned
by
its
inhabitants
and
there
found
that
which
served
for
food
his
long
fast
had
caused
him
to
feel
the
most
ravenous
hunger
seizing
whatever
he
found
that
was
eatable
whether
roots
acorns
or
bread
raw
meat
or
cooked
he
gorged
it
indiscriminately
issuing
thence
again
the
frantic
orlando
gave
chase
to
whatever
living
thing
he
saw
whether
men
or
animals
sometimes
he
pursued
the
deer
and
hind
sometimes
he
attacked
bears
and
wolves
and
with
his
naked
hands
killed
and
tore
them
and
devoured
their
flesh
thus
he
wandered
from
place
to
place
through
france
imperilling
his
life
a
thousand
ways
yet
always
preserved
by
some
mysterious
providence
from
a
fatal
result
but
here
we
leave
orlando
for
a
time
that
we
may
record
what
befell
zerbino
and
isabella
after
their
parting
with
him
the
prince
and
his
fair
bride
waited
by
orlando
request
near
the
scene
of
the
battle
for
three
days
that
if
mandricardo
should
return
they
might
inform
him
where
orlando
would
give
him
another
meeting
at
the
end
of
that
time
their
anxiety
to
know
the
issue
led
them
to
follow
orlando
traces
which
led
them
at
last
to
the
wood
where
the
trees
were
inscribed
with
the
names
of
angelica
and
medoro
they
remarked
how
all
these
inscriptions
were
defaced
and
how
the
grotto
was
disordered
and
the
fountain
clogged
with
rubbish
but
that
which
surprised
them
and
distressed
them
most
of
all
was
to
find
on
the
grass
the
cuirass
of
orlando
and
not
far
from
it
his
helmet
the
same
which
the
renowned
almontes
once
wore
hearing
a
horse
neigh
in
the
forest
zerbino
turned
his
eyes
in
that
direction
and
saw
brigliadoro
with
the
bridle
yet
hanging
at
the
he
looked
round
for
durindana
and
found
that
famous
sword
without
the
scabbard
lying
on
the
grass
he
saw
also
the
fragments
of
orlando
other
arms
and
clothing
scattered
on
all
sides
over
the
plain
zerbino
and
isabella
stood
in
astonishment
and
grief
not
knowing
what
to
think
but
little
imagining
the
true
cause
if
they
had
found
any
marks
of
blood
on
the
arms
or
on
the
fragments
of
the
clothing
they
would
have
supposed
him
slain
but
there
were
none
while
they
were
in
this
painful
uncertainty
they
saw
a
young
peasant
approach
he
not
yet
recovered
from
the
terror
of
the
scene
which
he
had
witnessed
from
the
top
of
a
rock
told
them
the
whole
of
the
sad
events
zerbino
with
his
eyes
full
of
tears
carefully
collected
all
the
scattered
arms
isabella
also
dismounted
to
aid
him
in
the
sad
duty
when
they
had
collected
all
the
pieces
of
that
rich
armor
they
hung
them
like
a
trophy
on
a
pine
and
to
prevent
their
being
violated
by
any
zerbino
inscribed
on
the
bark
this
caution
these
are
the
arms
of
the
paladin
orlando
having
finished
this
pious
work
he
remounted
his
horse
and
just
then
a
knight
rode
up
and
requested
zerbino
to
tell
him
the
meaning
of
the
trophy
the
prince
related
the
facts
as
they
had
happened
and
mandricardo
for
it
was
that
saracen
knight
full
of
joy
rushed
forward
and
seized
the
sword
saying
no
one
can
censure
me
for
what
i
do
this
sword
is
mine
i
can
take
my
own
wherever
i
find
it
it
is
plain
that
orlando
not
daring
to
defend
it
against
me
has
counterfeited
madness
to
excuse
him
in
surrendering
it
zerbino
vehemently
exclaimed
touch
not
that
sword
think
not
to
possess
it
without
a
contest
if
it
be
true
that
the
arms
you
wear
are
those
of
hector
you
must
have
got
them
by
theft
and
not
by
prowess
immediately
they
attacked
one
another
with
the
utmost
fury
the
air
resounded
with
blows
zerbino
skilful
and
alert
evaded
for
a
time
with
good
success
the
strokes
of
durindana
but
at
length
a
terrible
blow
struck
him
on
the
neck
he
fell
from
his
horse
and
the
tartar
king
possessed
of
the
spoils
of
his
victory
rode
away
zerbino
and
isabella
zerbino
pain
at
seeing
the
tartar
prince
go
off
with
the
sword
surpassed
the
anguish
of
his
wound
but
now
the
loss
of
blood
so
reduced
his
strength
that
he
could
not
move
from
where
he
fell
isabella
not
knowing
whither
to
resort
for
help
could
only
bemoan
him
and
chide
her
cruel
fate
zerbino
said
if
i
could
but
leave
thee
my
best
beloved
in
some
secure
abode
it
would
not
distress
me
to
die
but
to
abandon
thee
so
without
protection
is
sad
indeed
she
replied
think
not
to
leave
me
dearest
our
souls
shall
not
be
parted
this
sword
will
give
me
the
means
to
follow
thee
last
words
implored
her
to
banish
such
a
thought
but
live
and
be
true
to
his
memory
isabella
promised
with
many
tears
to
be
faithful
to
him
so
long
as
life
should
last
when
he
ceased
to
breathe
isabella
cries
resounded
through
the
forest
and
reached
the
ears
of
a
reverend
hermit
who
hastened
to
the
spot
he
soothed
and
calmed
her
urging
those
consolations
which
the
word
of
god
supplies
and
at
last
brought
her
to
wish
for
nothing
else
but
to
devote
herself
for
the
rest
of
life
wholly
to
religion
as
she
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
leaving
her
dead
lord
abandoned
the
body
was
by
the
good
hermit
aid
placed
upon
the
horse
and
taken
to
the
nearest
inhabited
place
where
a
chest
was
made
for
it
suitable
to
be
carried
with
them
on
their
way
the
hermit
plan
was
to
escort
his
charge
to
a
monastery
not
many
days
journey
distant
where
isabella
resolved
to
spend
the
remainder
of
her
days
thus
they
travelled
day
after
day
choosing
the
most
retired
ways
for
the
country
was
full
of
armed
men
one
day
a
cavalier
met
them
and
barred
their
way
it
was
no
other
than
rodomont
king
of
algiers
who
had
just
left
the
camp
of
agramant
full
of
indignation
at
the
treatment
he
had
received
from
doralice
at
sight
of
the
lovely
lady
and
her
reverend
attendant
with
their
horse
laden
with
a
burden
draped
with
black
he
asked
the
meaning
of
their
journey
isabella
told
him
her
affliction
and
her
resolution
to
renounce
the
world
and
devote
herself
to
religion
and
to
the
memory
of
the
friend
she
had
lost
rodomont
laughed
scornfully
at
this
and
told
her
that
her
project
was
absurd
that
charms
like
hers
were
meant
to
be
enjoyed
not
buried
and
that
he
himself
would
more
than
make
amends
for
her
dead
lover
the
monk
who
promptly
interposed
to
rebuke
this
impious
talk
was
commanded
to
hold
his
peace
and
still
persisting
was
seized
by
the
knight
and
hurled
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
where
he
fell
into
the
sea
and
was
drowned
rodomont
when
he
had
got
rid
of
the
hermit
again
applied
to
the
sad
lady
heartless
with
affright
and
in
the
language
used
by
lovers
said
she
was
his
very
heart
his
life
his
light
having
laid
aside
all
violence
he
humbly
sued
that
she
would
accompany
him
to
his
retreat
near
by
it
was
a
ruined
chapel
from
which
the
monks
had
been
driven
by
the
disorders
of
the
time
and
which
rodomont
had
taken
possession
of
isabella
who
had
no
choice
but
to
obey
followed
him
meditating
as
she
went
what
resource
she
could
find
to
escape
out
of
his
power
and
keep
her
vow
to
her
dead
husband
to
be
faithful
to
his
memory
as
long
as
life
should
last
at
length
she
said
if
my
lord
you
will
let
me
go
and
fulfil
my
vow
and
my
intention
as
i
have
already
declared
it
i
will
bestow
upon
you
what
will
be
to
you
of
more
value
than
a
hundred
women
hearts
i
know
an
herb
and
i
have
seen
it
on
our
way
which
rightly
prepared
affords
a
juice
of
such
power
that
the
flesh
if
laved
with
it
becomes
impenetrable
to
sword
or
fire
this
liquor
i
can
make
and
will
if
you
will
accept
my
offer
and
when
you
have
seen
its
virtue
you
will
value
it
more
than
if
all
europe
were
made
your
own
rodomont
at
hearing
this
readily
promised
all
that
was
asked
so
eager
was
he
to
learn
a
secret
that
would
make
him
as
achilles
was
of
yore
isabella
having
collected
such
herbs
as
she
thought
proper
and
boiled
them
with
certain
mysterious
signs
and
words
at
length
declared
her
labor
done
and
as
a
test
offered
to
try
its
virtue
on
herself
she
bathed
her
neck
and
bosom
with
the
liquor
and
then
called
on
rodomont
to
smite
with
all
his
force
and
see
whether
his
sword
had
power
to
harm
the
pagan
who
during
the
preparations
had
taken
frequent
draughts
of
wine
and
scarce
knew
what
he
did
drew
his
sword
at
the
word
and
struck
across
her
neck
with
all
his
might
and
the
fair
head
leapt
sundered
from
the
snowy
neck
and
breast
rude
and
unfeeling
as
he
was
the
pagan
knight
lamented
bitterly
this
sad
result
to
honor
her
memory
he
resolved
to
do
a
work
as
unparalleled
as
her
devotion
from
all
parts
round
he
caused
laborers
to
be
brought
and
had
a
tower
built
to
enclose
the
chapel
within
which
the
remains
of
zerbino
and
isabella
were
entombed
across
the
stream
which
flowed
near
by
he
built
a
bridge
scarce
two
yards
wide
and
added
neither
parapet
nor
rail
on
the
top
of
the
tower
a
sentry
was
placed
who
when
any
traveller
approached
the
bridge
gave
notice
to
his
master
rodomont
thereupon
sallied
out
and
defied
the
approaching
knight
to
fight
him
upon
the
bridge
where
any
chance
step
a
little
aside
would
plunge
the
rider
headlong
in
the
stream
this
bridge
he
vowed
to
keep
until
a
thousand
suits
of
armor
should
be
won
from
conquered
knights
wherewith
to
build
a
trophy
to
his
victim
and
her
lord
within
ten
days
the
bridge
was
built
and
the
tower
was
in
progress
in
a
short
time
many
knights
either
seeking
the
shortest
route
or
tempted
by
a
desire
of
adventure
had
made
the
attempt
to
pass
the
bridge
all
without
exception
had
lost
either
arms
or
life
or
both
some
falling
before
rodomont
lance
others
precipitated
into
the
river
one
day
as
rodomont
stood
urging
his
workmen
it
chanced
that
orlando
in
his
furious
mood
came
thither
and
approached
the
bridge
rodomont
halloed
to
him
halt
churl
presume
not
to
set
foot
upon
that
bridge
it
was
not
made
for
such
as
you
orlando
took
no
notice
but
pressed
on
just
then
a
gentle
damsel
rode
up
it
was
flordelis
who
was
seeking
her
florismart
she
saw
orlando
and
in
spite
of
his
strange
appearance
recognized
him
rodomont
not
used
to
have
his
commands
disobeyed
laid
hands
on
the
madman
and
would
have
thrown
him
into
the
river
but
to
his
astonishment
found
himself
in
the
gripe
of
one
not
so
easily
disposed
of
how
can
a
fool
have
such
strength
he
growled
between
his
teeth
flordelis
stopped
to
see
the
issue
where
each
of
these
two
puissant
warriors
strove
to
throw
the
other
from
the
bridge
orlando
at
last
had
strength
enough
to
lift
his
foe
with
all
his
armor
and
fling
him
over
the
side
but
had
not
wit
to
clear
himself
from
him
so
both
fell
together
high
flashed
the
wave
as
they
together
smote
its
surface
here
orlando
had
the
advantage
he
was
naked
and
could
swim
like
a
fish
he
soon
reached
the
bank
and
careless
of
praise
or
blame
stopped
not
to
see
what
came
of
the
adventure
rodomont
entangled
with
his
armor
escaped
with
difficulty
to
the
bank
meantime
flordelis
passed
the
bridge
unchallenged
after
long
wandering
without
success
she
returned
to
paris
and
there
found
the
object
of
her
search
for
florismart
after
the
fall
of
albracca
had
repaired
thither
the
joy
of
meeting
was
clouded
to
florismart
by
the
news
which
flordelis
brought
of
orlando
wretched
plight
the
last
she
had
seen
of
him
was
when
he
fell
with
rodomont
into
the
stream
florismart
who
loved
orlando
like
a
brother
resolved
to
set
out
immediately
under
the
guidance
of
the
lady
to
find
him
and
bring
him
where
he
might
receive
the
treatment
suited
to
his
case
a
few
days
brought
them
to
the
place
where
they
found
the
tartar
king
still
guarding
the
bridge
the
usual
challenge
and
defiance
was
made
and
the
knights
rode
to
encounter
one
another
on
the
bridge
at
the
first
encounter
both
horses
were
overthrown
and
having
no
space
to
regain
their
footing
fell
with
their
riders
into
the
water
rodomont
who
knew
the
soundings
of
the
stream
soon
recovered
the
land
but
florismart
was
carried
downward
by
the
current
and
landed
at
last
on
a
bank
of
mud
where
his
horse
could
hardly
find
footing
flordelis
who
watched
the
battle
from
the
bridge
seeing
her
lover
in
this
piteous
case
exclaimed
aloud
ah
rodomont
for
love
of
her
whom
dead
you
honor
have
pity
on
me
who
love
this
knight
and
slay
him
not
let
it
suffice
he
yields
his
armor
to
the
pile
and
none
more
glorious
will
it
bear
than
his
her
prayer
so
well
directed
touched
the
heart
though
hard
to
move
and
he
lent
his
aid
to
help
the
knight
to
land
he
kept
him
a
prisoner
however
and
added
his
armor
to
the
pile
flordelis
with
a
heavy
heart
went
her
way
we
must
now
return
to
rogero
who
when
we
parted
with
him
was
engaged
in
an
adventure
which
arrested
his
progress
to
the
monastery
whither
he
was
bound
with
the
intention
of
receiving
baptism
and
thus
qualifying
himself
to
demand
bradamante
as
his
bride
on
his
way
he
met
with
mandricardo
and
the
quarrel
was
revived
respecting
the
right
to
wear
the
badge
of
hector
after
a
warm
discussion
both
parties
agreed
to
submit
the
question
to
king
agramant
and
for
that
purpose
took
their
way
to
the
saracen
camp
here
they
met
gradasso
who
had
his
controversy
also
with
mandricardo
this
warrior
claimed
the
sword
of
orlando
denying
the
right
of
mandricardo
to
possess
it
in
virtue
of
his
having
found
it
abandoned
by
its
owner
king
agramant
strove
in
vain
to
reconcile
these
quarrels
and
was
forced
at
last
to
consent
that
the
points
in
dispute
should
be
settled
by
one
combat
in
which
mandricardo
should
meet
one
of
the
other
champions
to
whom
should
be
committed
the
cause
of
both
rogero
was
chosen
by
lot
to
maintain
gradasso
cause
and
his
own
great
preparations
were
made
for
this
signal
contest
on
the
appointed
day
it
was
fought
in
the
presence
of
agramant
and
of
the
whole
army
rogero
won
it
and
mandricardo
the
conqueror
of
hector
arms
the
challenger
of
orlando
and
the
slayer
of
zerbino
lost
his
life
gradasso
received
durindana
as
his
prize
which
lost
half
its
value
in
his
eyes
since
it
was
won
by
prowess
not
his
own
rogero
though
victorious
was
severely
wounded
and
lay
helpless
many
weeks
in
the
camp
of
agramant
while
bradamante
ignorant
of
the
cause
of
his
delay
expected
him
at
montalban
thither
he
had
promised
to
repair
in
fifteen
days
or
twenty
at
furthest
hoping
to
have
obtained
by
that
time
an
honorable
discharge
from
his
obligations
to
the
saracen
commander
the
twenty
days
were
passed
and
a
month
more
and
still
rogero
came
not
nor
did
any
tidings
reach
bradamante
accounting
for
his
absence
at
the
end
of
that
time
a
wandering
knight
brought
news
of
the
famous
combat
and
of
rogero
wound
he
added
what
alarmed
bradamante
still
more
that
marphisa
a
female
warrior
young
and
fair
was
in
attendance
on
the
wounded
knight
he
added
that
the
whole
army
expected
that
as
soon
as
rogero
wounds
were
healed
the
pair
would
be
united
in
marriage
bradamante
distressed
by
this
news
though
she
believed
it
but
in
part
resolved
to
go
immediately
and
see
for
herself
she
mounted
rabican
the
horse
of
astolpho
which
he
had
committed
to
her
care
and
took
with
her
the
lance
of
gold
though
unaware
of
its
wonderful
powers
thus
accoutred
she
left
the
castle
and
took
the
road
toward
paris
and
the
camp
of
the
saracens
marphisa
whose
devotion
to
rogero
in
his
illness
had
so
excited
the
jealousy
of
bradamante
was
the
twin
sister
of
rogero
she
with
him
had
been
taken
in
charge
when
an
infant
by
atlantes
the
magician
but
while
yet
a
child
she
had
been
stolen
away
by
an
arab
tribe
adopted
by
their
chief
she
had
early
learned
horsemanship
and
skill
in
arms
and
at
this
time
had
come
to
the
camp
of
agramant
with
no
other
view
than
to
see
and
test
for
herself
the
prowess
of
the
warriors
of
either
camp
whose
fame
rang
through
the
world
arriving
at
the
very
moment
of
the
late
encounter
the
name
of
rogero
and
some
few
facts
of
his
story
which
she
learned
were
enough
to
suggest
the
idea
that
it
was
her
brother
whom
she
saw
victorious
in
the
single
combat
inquiry
satisfied
the
two
of
their
near
kindred
and
from
that
moment
marphisa
devoted
herself
to
the
care
of
her
and
brother
in
those
moments
of
seclusion
rogero
informed
his
sister
of
what
he
had
learned
of
their
parentage
from
old
atlantes
rogero
their
father
a
christian
knight
had
won
the
heart
of
galaciella
daughter
of
the
sultan
of
africa
and
sister
of
king
agramant
converted
her
to
the
christian
faith
and
secretly
married
her
the
sultan
enraged
at
his
daughter
marriage
drove
her
husband
into
exile
and
caused
her
with
her
infant
children
rogero
and
marphisa
to
be
placed
in
a
boat
and
committed
to
the
winds
and
waves
to
perish
from
which
fate
they
were
saved
by
atlantes
on
hearing
this
marphisa
exclaimed
how
can
you
brother
leave
our
parents
unavenged
so
long
and
even
submit
to
serve
the
son
of
the
tyrant
who
so
wronged
them
rogero
replied
that
it
was
but
lately
he
had
learned
the
full
truth
that
when
he
learned
it
he
was
already
embarked
with
agramant
from
whom
he
had
received
knighthood
and
that
he
only
waited
for
a
suitable
opportunity
when
he
might
with
honor
desert
his
standard
and
at
the
same
time
return
to
the
faith
of
his
fathers
marphisa
hailed
this
resolution
with
joy
and
declared
her
intention
to
join
with
him
in
embracing
the
christian
faith
we
left
bradamante
when
mounted
on
rabican
and
armed
with
lance
she
rode
forth
determined
to
learn
the
cause
of
rogero
long
absence
one
day
as
she
rode
she
met
a
damsel
of
visage
and
of
manners
fair
but
overcome
with
grief
it
was
flordelis
who
was
seeking
far
and
near
a
champion
capable
of
liberating
and
avenging
her
lord
flordelis
marked
the
approaching
warrior
and
judging
from
appearances
thought
she
had
found
the
champion
she
sought
are
you
sir
knight
she
said
so
daring
and
so
kind
as
to
take
up
my
cause
against
a
fierce
and
cruel
warrior
who
has
made
prisoner
of
my
lord
and
forced
me
thus
to
be
a
wanderer
and
a
suppliant
then
she
related
the
events
which
had
happened
at
the
bridge
bradamante
to
whom
noble
enterprises
were
always
welcome
readily
embraced
this
and
the
rather
as
in
her
gloomy
forebodings
she
felt
as
if
rogero
was
forever
lost
to
her
next
day
the
two
arrived
at
the
bridge
the
sentry
descried
them
approaching
and
gave
notice
to
his
lord
who
thereupon
donned
his
armor
and
went
forth
to
meet
them
here
as
usual
he
called
on
the
advancing
warrior
to
yield
his
horse
and
arms
an
oblation
to
the
tomb
bradamante
replied
asking
by
what
right
he
called
on
the
innocent
to
do
penance
for
his
crime
your
life
and
your
armor
she
added
are
the
fittest
offering
to
her
tomb
and
i
a
woman
the
fittest
champion
to
take
them
with
that
she
couched
her
spear
spurred
her
horse
and
ran
to
the
encounter
king
rodomont
came
on
with
speed
the
trampling
sounded
on
the
bridge
like
thunder
it
took
but
a
moment
to
decide
the
contest
the
golden
lance
did
its
office
and
that
fierce
moor
so
renowned
in
tourney
lay
extended
on
the
bridge
who
is
the
loser
now
said
bradamante
but
rodomont
amazed
that
a
woman
hand
should
have
laid
him
low
could
not
or
would
not
answer
silent
and
sad
he
raised
himself
unbound
his
helm
and
mail
and
flung
them
against
the
tomb
then
sullen
and
on
foot
left
the
ground
but
first
gave
orders
to
one
of
his
squires
to
release
all
his
prisoners
they
had
been
sent
off
to
africa
besides
florismart
there
were
sansonnet
and
oliver
who
had
ridden
that
way
in
quest
of
orlando
and
had
both
in
turn
been
overthrown
in
the
encounter
bradamante
after
her
victory
resumed
her
route
and
in
due
time
reached
the
christian
camp
where
she
readily
learned
an
explanation
of
the
mystery
which
had
caused
her
so
much
anxiety
rogero
and
his
fair
and
brave
sister
marphisa
were
too
illustrious
by
their
station
and
exploits
not
to
be
the
frequent
topic
of
discourse
even
among
their
adversaries
and
all
that
bradamante
was
anxious
to
know
reached
her
ear
almost
without
inquiry
we
now
return
to
gradasso
who
by
rogero
victory
had
been
made
possessor
of
durindana
there
now
only
remained
to
him
to
seek
the
horse
of
rinaldo
and
the
challenge
given
and
accepted
was
yet
to
be
fought
with
that
warrior
for
it
had
been
interrupted
by
the
arts
of
malagigi
gradasso
now
sought
another
meeting
with
rinaldo
and
met
with
no
reluctance
on
his
part
as
the
combat
was
for
the
possession
of
bayard
the
knights
dismounted
and
fought
on
foot
long
time
the
battle
lasted
rinaldo
knowing
well
the
deadly
stroke
of
durindana
used
all
his
art
to
parry
or
avoid
its
blow
gradasso
struck
with
might
and
main
but
wellnigh
all
his
strokes
were
spent
in
air
or
if
they
smote
they
fell
obliquely
and
did
little
harm
thus
had
they
fought
long
glancing
at
one
another
eyes
and
seeing
naught
else
when
their
attention
was
arrested
perforce
by
a
strange
noise
they
turned
and
beheld
the
good
bayard
attacked
by
a
monstrous
bird
perhaps
it
was
a
bird
for
such
it
seemed
but
when
or
where
such
a
bird
was
ever
seen
i
have
nowhere
read
except
in
turpin
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
it
was
not
a
bird
but
a
fiend
evoked
from
underground
by
malagigi
and
thither
sent
on
purpose
to
interrupt
the
fight
whether
a
fiend
or
a
fowl
the
monster
flew
right
at
bayard
and
clapped
his
wings
in
his
face
thereat
the
steed
broke
loose
and
ran
madly
across
the
plain
pursued
by
the
bird
till
bayard
plunged
into
the
wood
and
was
lost
to
sight
rinaldo
and
gradasso
seeing
bayard
escape
agreed
to
suspend
their
battle
till
they
could
recover
the
horse
the
object
of
contention
gradasso
mounted
his
steed
and
followed
the
of
bayard
into
the
forest
rinaldo
never
more
vexed
in
spirit
remained
at
the
spot
gradasso
having
promised
to
return
thither
with
the
horse
if
he
found
him
he
did
find
him
after
long
search
for
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
hear
him
neigh
thus
he
became
possessed
of
both
the
objects
for
which
he
had
led
an
army
from
his
own
country
and
invaded
france
he
did
not
forget
his
promise
to
bring
bayard
back
to
the
place
where
he
had
left
rinaldo
but
only
muttering
now
i
have
got
him
he
little
knows
me
who
expects
me
to
give
him
up
if
rinaldo
wants
the
horse
let
him
seek
him
in
india
as
i
have
sought
him
in
france
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
arles
where
his
vessels
lay
and
in
possession
of
the
two
objects
of
his
ambition
the
horse
and
the
sword
sailed
away
to
his
own
country
astolpho
in
abyssinia
when
we
last
parted
with
the
adventurous
paladin
astolpho
he
was
just
commencing
that
flight
over
the
countries
of
the
world
from
which
he
promised
himself
so
much
gratification
our
readers
are
aware
that
the
eagle
and
the
falcon
have
not
so
swift
a
flight
as
the
hippogriff
on
which
astolpho
rode
it
was
not
long
therefore
before
the
paladin
directing
his
course
toward
the
southeast
arrived
over
that
part
of
africa
where
the
great
river
nile
has
its
source
here
he
alighted
and
found
himself
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
capital
of
abyssinia
ruled
by
senapus
whose
riches
and
power
were
immense
his
palace
was
of
surpassing
splendor
the
bars
of
the
gates
the
hinges
and
locks
were
all
of
pure
gold
in
fact
this
metal
in
that
country
is
put
to
all
those
uses
for
which
we
employ
iron
it
is
so
common
that
they
prefer
for
ornamental
purposes
rock
crystal
of
which
all
the
columns
were
made
precious
stones
of
different
kinds
rubies
emeralds
sapphires
and
topazes
were
set
in
ornamental
designs
and
the
walls
and
ceilings
were
adorned
with
pearls
it
is
in
this
country
those
famous
balms
grow
of
which
there
are
some
few
plants
in
that
part
of
judaea
called
gilead
musk
ambergris
and
numerous
gums
so
precious
in
europe
are
here
in
their
native
climate
it
is
said
the
sultan
of
egypt
pays
a
vast
tribute
to
the
monarch
of
this
country
to
hire
him
not
to
cut
off
the
source
of
the
nile
which
he
might
easily
do
and
cause
the
river
to
flow
in
some
other
direction
thus
depriving
egypt
of
the
source
of
its
fertility
at
the
time
of
astolpho
arrival
in
his
dominions
this
monarch
was
in
great
affliction
in
spite
of
his
riches
and
the
precious
productions
of
his
country
he
was
in
danger
of
dying
of
hunger
he
was
a
prey
to
a
flock
of
obscene
birds
called
harpies
which
attacked
him
whenever
he
sat
at
meat
and
with
their
claws
snatched
tore
and
scattered
everything
overturning
the
vessels
devouring
the
food
and
infecting
what
they
left
with
their
filthy
touch
it
was
said
this
punishment
was
inflicted
upon
the
king
because
when
young
and
filled
with
pride
and
presumption
he
had
attempted
to
invade
with
an
army
the
terrestrial
paradise
which
is
situated
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
whence
the
nile
draws
its
source
nor
was
this
his
only
punishment
he
was
struck
blind
astolpho
on
arriving
in
the
dominions
of
this
monarch
hastened
to
pay
him
his
respects
king
senapus
received
him
graciously
and
ordered
a
splendid
repast
to
be
prepared
in
honor
of
his
arrival
while
the
guests
were
seated
at
table
astolpho
filling
the
place
of
dignity
at
the
king
right
hand
the
horrid
scream
of
the
harpies
was
heard
in
the
air
and
soon
they
approached
hovering
over
the
tables
seizing
the
food
from
the
dishes
and
overturning
everything
with
the
flapping
of
their
broad
wings
in
vain
the
guests
struck
at
them
with
knives
and
any
weapons
which
they
had
and
astolpho
drew
his
sword
and
gave
them
repeated
blows
which
seemed
to
have
no
more
effect
upon
them
than
if
their
bodies
had
been
made
of
tow
at
last
astolpho
thought
of
his
horn
he
first
gave
warning
to
the
king
and
his
guests
to
stop
their
ears
then
blew
a
blast
the
harpies
terrified
at
the
sound
flew
away
as
fast
as
their
wings
could
carry
them
the
paladin
mounted
his
hippogriff
and
pursued
them
blowing
his
horn
as
often
as
he
came
near
them
they
stretched
their
flight
towards
the
great
mountain
at
the
foot
of
which
there
is
a
cavern
which
is
thought
to
be
the
mouth
of
the
infernal
abodes
hither
those
horrid
birds
flew
as
if
to
their
home
having
seen
them
all
disappear
in
the
recess
astolpho
cared
not
to
pursue
them
farther
but
alighting
rolled
huge
stones
into
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
piled
branches
of
trees
therein
so
that
he
effectually
barred
their
passage
out
and
we
have
no
evidence
of
their
ever
having
been
seen
since
in
the
outer
air
after
this
labor
astolpho
refreshed
himself
by
bathing
in
a
fountain
whose
pure
waters
bubbled
from
a
cleft
of
the
rock
having
rested
awhile
an
earnest
desire
seized
him
of
ascending
the
mountain
which
towered
above
him
the
hippogriff
bore
him
swiftly
upwards
and
landed
him
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
which
he
found
to
be
an
extensive
plain
a
splendid
palace
rose
in
the
middle
of
this
plain
whose
walls
shone
with
such
brilliancy
that
mortal
eyes
could
hardly
bear
the
sight
astolpho
guided
the
winged
horse
towards
this
edifice
and
made
him
poise
himself
in
the
air
while
he
took
a
leisurely
survey
of
this
favored
spot
and
its
environs
it
seemed
as
if
nature
and
art
had
striven
with
one
another
to
see
which
could
do
the
most
for
its
embellishment
astolpho
on
approaching
the
edifice
saw
a
venerable
man
advance
to
meet
him
this
personage
was
clothed
in
a
long
vesture
as
white
as
snow
while
a
mantle
of
purple
covered
his
shoulders
and
hung
down
to
the
ground
a
white
beard
descended
to
his
middle
and
his
hair
of
the
same
color
overshadowed
his
shoulders
his
eyes
were
so
brilliant
that
astolpho
felt
persuaded
that
he
was
a
blessed
inhabitant
of
the
heavenly
mansions
the
sage
smiling
benignantly
upon
the
paladin
who
from
respect
had
dismounted
from
his
horse
said
to
him
noble
chevalier
know
that
it
is
by
the
divine
will
you
have
been
brought
to
the
terrestrial
paradise
your
mortal
nature
could
not
have
borne
to
scale
these
heights
and
reach
these
seats
of
bliss
if
it
were
not
the
will
of
heaven
that
you
should
be
instructed
in
the
means
to
succor
charles
and
to
sustain
the
glory
of
our
holy
faith
i
am
prepared
to
impart
the
needed
counsels
but
before
i
begin
let
me
welcome
you
to
our
sojourn
i
doubt
not
your
long
fast
and
distant
journey
have
given
you
a
good
appetite
the
aspect
of
the
venerable
man
filled
the
prince
with
admiration
but
his
surprise
ceased
when
he
learned
from
him
that
he
was
that
one
of
the
apostles
of
our
lord
to
whom
he
said
i
will
that
thou
tarry
till
i
come
john
conducting
astolpho
rejoined
his
companions
these
were
the
patriarch
enoch
and
the
prophet
elijah
neither
of
whom
had
yet
seen
his
dying
day
but
taken
from
our
lower
world
were
dwelling
in
a
region
of
peace
and
joy
in
a
climate
of
eternal
spring
till
the
last
trumpet
shall
sound
the
three
holy
inhabitants
of
the
terrestrial
paradise
received
astolpho
with
the
greatest
kindness
carried
him
to
a
pleasant
apartment
and
took
great
care
of
the
hippogriff
to
whom
they
gave
such
food
as
suited
him
while
to
the
prince
they
presented
fruits
so
delicious
that
he
felt
inclined
to
excuse
our
first
parents
for
their
sin
in
eating
them
without
permission
astolpho
having
recruited
his
strength
not
only
by
these
excellent
fruits
but
also
by
sweet
sleep
roused
himself
at
the
first
blush
of
dawn
and
as
soon
as
he
left
his
chamber
met
the
beloved
apostle
coming
to
seek
him
john
took
him
by
the
hand
and
told
him
many
things
relating
to
the
past
and
the
future
among
others
he
said
son
let
me
tell
you
what
is
now
going
on
in
france
orlando
the
illustrious
prince
who
received
at
his
birth
the
endowment
of
strength
and
courage
more
than
mortal
raised
up
as
was
samson
of
old
to
be
the
champion
of
the
true
faith
has
been
guilty
of
the
basest
ingratitude
in
leaving
the
christian
camp
when
it
most
needed
the
support
of
his
arm
to
run
after
a
saracen
princess
whom
he
would
fain
marry
though
she
scorns
him
to
punish
him
his
reason
has
been
taken
away
so
that
he
runs
naked
through
the
land
over
mountains
and
through
valleys
without
a
ray
of
intelligence
the
duration
of
his
punishment
has
been
fixed
at
three
months
and
that
time
having
nearly
expired
you
have
been
brought
hither
to
learn
from
us
the
means
by
which
the
reason
of
orlando
may
be
restored
true
you
will
be
obliged
to
make
a
journey
with
me
and
we
must
even
leave
the
earth
and
ascend
to
the
moon
for
it
is
in
that
planet
we
are
to
seek
the
remedy
for
the
madness
of
the
paladin
i
propose
to
make
our
journey
this
evening
as
soon
as
the
moon
appears
over
our
head
as
soon
as
the
sun
sunk
beneath
the
seas
and
the
moon
presented
its
luminous
disk
the
holy
man
had
the
chariot
brought
out
in
which
he
was
accustomed
to
make
excursions
among
the
stars
the
same
which
was
employed
long
ago
to
convey
elijah
up
from
earth
the
saint
made
astolpho
seat
himself
beside
him
took
the
reins
and
giving
the
word
to
the
coursers
they
bore
them
upward
with
astonishing
celerity
at
length
they
reached
the
great
continent
of
the
moon
its
surface
appeared
to
be
of
polished
steel
with
here
and
there
a
spot
which
like
rust
obscured
its
brightness
the
paladin
was
astonished
to
see
that
the
earth
with
all
its
seas
and
rivers
seemed
but
an
insignificant
spot
in
the
distance
the
prince
discovered
in
this
region
so
new
to
him
rivers
lakes
plains
hills
and
valleys
many
beautiful
cities
and
castles
enriched
the
landscape
he
saw
also
vast
forests
and
heard
in
them
the
sound
of
horns
and
the
barking
of
dogs
which
led
him
to
conclude
that
the
nymphs
were
following
the
chase
the
knight
filled
with
wonder
at
all
he
saw
was
conducted
by
the
saint
to
a
valley
where
he
stood
amazed
at
the
riches
strewed
all
around
him
well
he
might
be
so
for
that
valley
was
the
receptacle
of
things
lost
on
earth
either
by
men
fault
or
by
the
effect
of
time
and
chance
let
no
one
suppose
we
speak
here
of
kingdoms
or
of
treasures
they
are
the
toys
of
fortune
which
she
dispenses
in
turning
her
wheel
we
speak
of
things
which
she
can
neither
give
nor
take
away
such
are
reputations
which
appear
at
one
time
so
brilliant
and
a
short
time
after
are
heard
of
no
more
here
also
are
countless
vows
and
prayers
for
unattainable
objects
lovers
sighs
and
tears
time
spent
in
gaming
dressing
and
doing
nothing
the
leisure
of
the
dull
and
the
intentions
of
the
lazy
baseless
projects
intrigues
and
plots
these
and
such
like
things
fill
all
the
valley
astolpho
had
a
great
desire
to
understand
all
that
he
saw
and
which
appeared
to
him
so
extraordinary
among
the
rest
he
observed
a
great
mountain
of
blown
bladders
from
which
issued
indistinct
noises
the
saint
told
him
these
were
the
dynasties
of
assyrian
and
persian
kings
once
the
wonder
of
the
earth
of
which
now
scarce
the
name
remains
astolpho
could
not
help
laughing
when
the
saint
said
to
him
all
these
hooks
of
silver
and
gold
that
you
see
are
the
gifts
of
courtiers
to
princes
made
in
the
hope
of
getting
something
better
in
return
he
also
showed
him
garlands
of
flowers
in
which
snares
were
concealed
these
were
flatteries
and
adulations
meant
to
deceive
but
nothing
was
so
comical
as
the
sight
of
numerous
grasshoppers
which
had
burst
their
lungs
with
chirping
these
he
told
him
were
sonnets
odes
and
dedications
addressed
by
venal
poets
to
great
people
the
paladin
beheld
with
wonder
what
seemed
a
lake
of
spilled
milk
it
is
said
the
saint
the
charity
done
by
frightened
misers
on
their
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
all
that
the
valley
contained
meanness
affectations
pretended
virtues
and
concealed
vices
were
there
in
abundance
among
the
rest
astolpho
perceived
many
days
of
his
own
lost
and
many
imprudent
sallies
which
he
had
made
and
would
have
been
glad
not
to
have
been
reminded
of
but
he
also
saw
among
so
many
lost
things
a
great
abundance
of
one
thing
which
men
are
apt
to
think
they
all
possess
and
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
pray
for
good
sense
this
commodity
appeared
under
the
form
of
a
liquor
most
light
and
apt
to
evaporate
it
was
therefore
kept
in
vials
firmly
sealed
one
of
these
was
labelled
the
sense
of
the
paladin
orlando
all
the
bottles
were
ticketed
and
the
sage
placed
one
in
hand
which
he
found
was
his
own
it
was
more
than
half
full
he
was
surprised
to
find
there
many
other
vials
which
contained
almost
the
whole
of
the
wits
of
many
persons
who
passed
among
men
for
wise
ah
how
easy
it
is
to
lose
one
reason
some
lose
theirs
by
yielding
to
the
sway
of
the
passions
some
in
braving
tempests
and
shoals
in
search
of
wealth
some
by
trusting
too
much
to
the
promises
of
the
great
some
by
setting
their
hearts
on
trifles
as
might
have
been
expected
the
bottles
which
held
the
wits
of
astrologers
inventors
metaphysicians
and
above
all
of
poets
were
in
general
the
best
filled
of
all
astolpho
took
his
bottle
put
it
to
his
nose
and
inhaled
it
all
and
turpin
assures
us
that
he
was
for
a
long
time
afterwards
as
sage
as
one
could
wish
but
the
archbishop
adds
that
there
was
reason
to
fear
that
some
of
the
precious
fluid
afterwards
found
its
way
back
into
the
bottle
the
paladin
took
also
the
bottle
which
belonged
to
orlando
it
was
a
large
one
and
quite
full
before
quitting
the
planetary
region
astolpho
was
conducted
to
an
edifice
on
the
borders
of
a
river
he
was
shown
an
immense
hall
full
of
bundles
of
silk
linen
cotton
and
wool
a
thousand
different
colors
brilliant
or
dull
some
quite
black
were
among
these
skeins
in
one
part
of
the
hall
an
old
woman
was
busy
winding
off
yarns
from
all
these
different
bundles
when
she
had
finished
a
skein
another
ancient
dame
took
it
and
placed
it
with
others
a
third
selected
from
the
fleeces
spun
and
mingled
them
in
due
proportions
the
paladin
inquired
what
all
this
might
be
these
old
women
said
the
saint
are
the
fates
who
spin
measure
and
terminate
the
lives
of
mortals
as
long
as
the
thread
stretches
in
one
of
those
skeins
so
long
does
the
mortal
enjoy
the
light
of
day
but
nature
and
death
are
on
the
alert
to
shut
the
eyes
of
those
whose
thread
is
spun
each
one
of
the
skeins
had
a
label
of
gold
silver
or
iron
bearing
the
name
of
the
individual
to
whom
it
belonged
an
old
man
who
in
spite
of
the
burden
of
years
seemed
brisk
and
active
ran
without
ceasing
to
fill
his
apron
with
these
labels
and
carried
them
away
to
throw
them
into
the
river
whose
name
was
lethe
when
he
reached
the
shore
of
the
river
the
old
man
shook
out
his
apron
and
the
labels
sunk
to
the
bottom
a
small
number
only
floated
for
a
time
hardly
one
in
a
thousand
numberless
birds
hawks
crows
and
vultures
hovered
over
the
stream
with
clamorous
cries
and
strove
to
snatch
from
the
water
some
of
these
names
but
they
were
too
heavy
for
them
and
after
a
while
the
birds
were
forced
to
let
them
drop
into
the
river
of
oblivion
but
two
beautiful
swans
of
snowy
whiteness
gathered
some
few
of
the
names
and
returned
with
them
to
the
shore
where
a
lovely
nymph
received
them
from
their
beaks
and
carried
them
to
a
temple
placed
upon
a
hill
and
suspended
them
for
all
time
upon
a
sacred
column
on
which
stood
the
statue
of
immortality
astolpho
was
amazed
at
all
this
and
asked
his
guide
to
explain
it
he
replied
the
old
man
is
time
all
the
names
upon
the
tickets
would
be
immortal
if
the
old
man
did
not
plunge
them
into
the
river
of
oblivion
those
clamorous
birds
which
make
vain
efforts
to
save
certain
of
the
names
are
flatterers
pensioners
venal
rhymesters
who
do
their
best
to
rescue
from
oblivion
the
unworthy
names
of
their
patrons
but
all
in
vain
they
may
keep
them
from
their
fate
a
little
while
but
ere
long
the
river
of
oblivion
must
swallow
them
all
the
swans
that
with
harmonious
strains
carry
certain
names
to
the
temple
of
eternal
memory
are
the
great
poets
who
save
from
oblivion
worse
than
death
the
names
of
those
they
judge
worthy
of
immortality
swans
of
this
kind
are
rare
let
monarchs
know
the
true
breed
and
fail
not
to
nourish
with
care
such
as
may
chance
to
appear
in
their
time
the
war
in
africa
when
astolpho
had
descended
to
the
earth
with
the
precious
phial
john
showed
him
a
plant
of
marvellous
virtues
with
which
he
told
him
he
had
only
to
touch
the
eyes
of
the
king
of
abyssinia
to
restore
him
to
sight
that
important
service
said
the
saint
added
to
your
having
delivered
him
from
the
harpies
will
induce
him
to
give
you
an
army
wherewith
to
attack
the
africans
in
their
rear
and
force
them
to
return
from
france
to
defend
their
own
country
the
saint
also
instructed
him
how
to
lead
his
troops
in
safety
across
the
great
deserts
where
caravans
are
often
overwhelmed
with
moving
columns
of
sand
astolpho
fortified
with
ample
instructions
remounted
the
hippogriff
thanked
the
saint
received
his
blessing
and
took
his
flight
down
to
the
level
country
keeping
the
course
of
the
river
nile
he
soon
arrived
at
the
capital
of
abyssinia
and
rejoined
senapus
the
joy
of
the
king
was
great
when
he
heard
again
the
voice
of
the
hero
who
had
delivered
him
from
the
harpies
astolpho
touched
his
eyes
with
the
plant
which
he
had
brought
from
the
terrestrial
paradise
and
restored
their
sight
the
gratitude
was
unbounded
he
begged
him
to
name
a
reward
promising
to
grant
it
whatever
it
might
be
astolpho
asked
an
army
to
go
to
the
assistance
of
charlemagne
and
the
king
not
only
granted
him
a
hundred
thousand
men
but
offered
to
lead
them
himself
the
night
before
the
day
appointed
for
the
departure
of
the
troops
astolpho
mounted
his
winged
horse
and
directed
his
flight
towards
a
mountain
whence
the
fierce
issues
whose
blast
raises
the
sands
of
the
nubian
desert
and
whirls
them
onward
in
overwhelming
clouds
the
paladin
by
the
advice
of
john
had
prepared
himself
with
a
leather
bag
which
he
placed
adroitly
with
its
mouth
open
over
the
vent
whence
issues
this
terrible
wind
at
the
first
dawn
of
morning
the
wind
rushed
from
its
cavern
to
resume
its
daily
course
and
was
caught
in
the
bag
and
securely
tied
up
astolpho
delighted
with
his
prize
returned
to
his
army
placed
himself
at
their
head
and
commenced
his
march
the
abyssinians
traversed
without
danger
or
difficulty
those
vast
fields
of
sand
which
separate
their
country
from
the
kingdoms
of
northern
africa
for
the
terrible
taken
completely
captive
had
not
force
enough
left
to
blow
out
a
candle
senapus
was
distressed
that
he
could
not
furnish
any
cavalry
for
his
country
rich
in
camels
and
elephants
was
destitute
of
horses
this
difficulty
the
saint
had
foreseen
and
had
taught
astolpho
the
means
of
remedying
he
now
put
those
means
in
operation
having
reached
a
place
whence
he
beheld
a
vast
plain
and
the
sea
he
chose
from
his
troops
those
who
appeared
to
be
the
best
made
and
the
most
intelligent
these
he
caused
to
be
arranged
in
squadrons
at
the
foot
of
a
lofty
mountain
which
bordered
the
plain
and
he
himself
mounted
to
the
summit
to
carry
into
effect
his
great
design
here
he
found
vast
quantities
of
fragments
of
rock
and
pebbles
these
he
set
rolling
down
the
side
and
wonderful
to
relate
as
they
rolled
they
grew
in
size
made
themselves
bodies
legs
necks
and
long
faces
next
they
began
to
neigh
to
curvet
to
scamper
on
all
sides
over
the
plain
some
were
bay
some
roan
some
dapple
some
chestnut
the
troops
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
exerted
themselves
to
catch
these
horses
which
they
easily
did
for
the
miracle
had
been
so
considerate
as
to
provide
all
the
horses
with
bridles
and
saddles
astolpho
thus
suddenly
found
himself
supplied
with
an
excellent
corps
of
cavalry
not
fewer
as
archbishop
turpin
asserts
than
eighty
thousand
strong
with
these
troops
astolpho
reduced
all
the
country
to
subjection
and
at
last
arrived
before
the
walls
of
agramant
capital
city
biserta
to
which
he
laid
siege
we
must
now
return
to
the
camp
of
the
christians
which
lay
before
arles
to
which
city
the
saracens
had
retired
after
being
defeated
in
a
night
attack
led
on
by
rinaldo
agramant
here
received
the
tidings
of
the
invasion
of
his
country
by
a
fresh
enemy
the
abyssinians
and
learned
that
biserta
was
in
danger
of
falling
into
their
hands
he
took
counsel
of
his
officers
and
decided
to
send
an
embassy
to
charles
proposing
that
the
whole
quarrel
should
be
submitted
to
the
combat
of
two
warriors
one
from
each
side
according
to
the
issue
of
which
it
should
be
decided
which
party
should
pay
tribute
to
the
other
and
the
war
should
cease
charlemagne
who
had
not
heard
of
the
favorable
turn
which
affairs
had
taken
in
africa
readily
agreed
to
this
proposal
and
rinaldo
was
selected
on
the
part
of
the
christians
to
sustain
the
combat
the
saracens
selected
rogero
for
their
champion
rogero
was
still
in
the
saracen
camp
kept
there
by
honor
alone
for
his
mind
had
been
opened
to
the
truth
of
the
christian
faith
by
the
arguments
of
bradamante
and
he
had
resolved
to
leave
the
party
of
the
infidels
on
the
first
favorable
opportunity
and
to
join
the
christian
side
but
his
honor
forbade
him
to
do
this
while
his
former
friends
were
in
distress
and
thus
he
waited
for
what
time
might
bring
forth
when
he
was
startled
by
the
announcement
that
he
had
been
selected
to
uphold
the
cause
of
the
saracens
against
the
christians
and
that
his
foe
was
to
be
rinaldo
the
brother
of
bradamante
while
rogero
was
overwhelmed
with
this
intelligence
bradamante
on
her
side
felt
the
deepest
distress
at
hearing
of
the
proposed
combat
if
rogero
should
fall
she
felt
that
no
other
man
living
was
worthy
of
her
love
and
if
on
the
other
hand
heaven
should
resolve
to
punish
france
by
the
death
of
her
chosen
champion
bradamante
would
have
to
deplore
her
brother
so
dear
to
her
and
be
no
less
completely
severed
from
the
object
of
her
affections
while
the
fair
lady
gave
herself
up
to
these
sad
thoughts
the
sage
enchantress
melissa
suddenly
appeared
before
her
fear
not
my
daughter
said
she
i
shall
find
a
way
to
interrupt
this
combat
which
so
distresses
you
meanwhile
rinaldo
and
rogero
prepared
their
weapons
for
the
conflict
rinaldo
had
the
choice
and
decided
that
it
should
be
on
foot
and
with
no
weapons
but
the
and
poniard
the
place
assigned
was
a
plain
between
the
camp
of
charlemagne
and
the
walls
of
arles
hardly
had
the
dawn
announced
the
day
appointed
for
this
memorable
combat
when
heralds
proceeded
from
both
sides
to
mark
the
lists
erelong
the
african
troops
were
seen
to
advance
from
the
city
agramant
at
their
head
his
brilliant
arms
adorned
in
the
moorish
fashion
his
horse
a
bay
with
a
white
star
on
his
forehead
rogero
marched
at
his
side
and
some
of
the
greatest
warriors
of
the
saracen
camp
attended
him
bearing
the
various
parts
of
his
armor
and
weapons
charlemagne
on
his
part
proceeded
from
his
intrenchments
ranged
his
troops
in
semicircle
and
stood
surrounded
by
his
peers
and
paladins
some
of
them
bore
portions
of
the
armor
of
rinaldo
the
celebrated
ogier
the
dane
bearing
the
helmet
which
rinaldo
took
from
mambrino
duke
namo
of
bavaria
and
salomon
of
bretagne
bore
two
axes
of
equal
weight
prepared
for
the
occasion
the
terms
of
the
combat
were
then
sworn
to
with
the
utmost
solemnity
by
all
parties
it
was
agreed
that
if
from
either
part
any
attempt
was
made
to
interrupt
the
battle
both
combatants
should
turn
their
arms
against
the
party
which
should
be
guilty
of
the
interruption
and
both
monarchs
assented
to
the
condition
that
in
such
case
the
champion
of
the
offending
party
should
be
discharged
from
his
allegiance
and
at
liberty
to
transfer
his
arms
to
the
other
side
when
all
the
preparations
were
concluded
the
monarchs
and
their
attendants
retired
each
to
his
own
side
and
the
champions
were
left
alone
the
two
warriors
advanced
with
measured
steps
towards
each
other
and
met
in
the
middle
of
the
space
they
attacked
one
another
at
the
same
moment
and
the
air
resounded
with
the
blows
they
gave
sparks
flew
from
their
while
the
velocity
with
which
they
managed
their
weapons
astonished
the
beholders
rogero
always
remembering
that
his
antagonist
was
the
brother
of
his
betrothed
could
not
aim
a
deadly
wound
he
strove
only
to
ward
off
those
levelled
against
himself
rinaldo
on
the
other
hand
much
as
he
esteemed
rogero
spared
not
his
blows
for
he
eagerly
desired
victory
for
his
own
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
his
country
and
his
faith
the
saracens
soon
perceived
that
their
champion
fought
feebly
and
gave
not
to
rinaldo
such
blows
as
he
received
from
him
his
disadvantage
was
so
marked
that
anxiety
and
shame
were
manifest
on
the
countenance
of
agramant
melissa
one
of
the
most
acute
enchantresses
that
ever
lived
seized
this
moment
to
disguise
herself
under
the
form
of
rodomont
that
rude
and
impetuous
warrior
who
had
now
for
some
time
been
absent
from
the
saracen
camp
approaching
agramant
she
said
how
could
you
my
lord
have
the
imprudence
of
selecting
a
young
man
without
experience
to
oppose
the
most
redoubtable
warrior
of
france
surely
you
must
have
been
regardless
of
the
honor
of
your
arms
and
of
the
fate
of
your
empire
but
it
is
not
too
late
break
without
delay
the
agreement
which
is
sure
to
result
in
your
ruin
so
saying
she
addressed
the
troops
who
stood
near
friends
said
she
follow
me
under
my
guidance
every
one
of
you
will
be
a
match
for
a
score
of
those
feeble
christians
agramant
delighted
at
seeing
rodomont
once
more
at
his
side
gave
his
consent
and
the
saracens
at
the
instant
couched
their
lances
set
spurs
to
their
steeds
and
swept
down
upon
the
french
melissa
when
she
saw
her
work
successful
disappeared
rinaldo
and
rogero
seeing
the
truce
broken
and
the
two
armies
engaged
in
general
conflict
stopped
their
battle
their
martial
fury
ceased
at
once
they
joined
hands
and
resolved
to
act
no
more
on
either
side
until
it
should
be
clearly
ascertained
which
party
had
failed
to
observe
its
oath
both
renewed
their
promise
to
abandon
forever
the
party
which
had
been
thus
false
and
perjured
meanwhile
the
christians
after
the
first
moment
of
surprise
met
the
saracens
with
courage
redoubled
by
rage
at
the
treachery
of
their
foes
guido
the
wild
brother
and
rival
of
rinaldo
griffon
and
aquilant
sons
of
oliver
and
numerous
others
whose
names
have
already
been
celebrated
in
our
recitals
beat
back
the
assailants
and
at
last
after
prodigious
slaughter
forced
them
to
take
shelter
within
the
walls
of
arles
we
will
now
return
to
orlando
whom
we
last
heard
of
as
furiously
mad
and
doing
a
thousand
acts
of
violence
in
his
senseless
rage
one
day
he
came
to
the
borders
of
a
stream
which
intercepted
his
course
he
swam
across
it
for
he
could
swim
like
an
otter
and
on
the
other
side
saw
a
peasant
watering
his
horse
he
seized
the
animal
in
spite
of
the
resistance
of
the
peasant
and
rode
it
with
furious
speed
till
he
arrived
at
the
where
spain
is
divided
from
africa
by
only
a
narrow
strait
at
the
moment
of
his
arrival
a
vessel
had
just
put
off
to
cross
the
strait
she
was
full
of
people
who
with
glass
in
hand
seemed
to
be
taking
a
merry
farewell
of
the
land
wafted
by
a
favorable
breeze
the
frantic
orlando
cried
out
to
them
to
stop
and
take
him
in
but
they
having
no
desire
to
admit
a
madman
to
their
company
paid
him
no
attention
the
paladin
thought
this
behavior
very
uncivil
and
by
force
of
blows
made
his
horse
carry
him
into
the
water
in
pursuit
of
the
ship
the
wretched
animal
soon
had
only
his
head
above
water
but
as
orlando
urged
him
forward
nothing
was
left
for
the
poor
beast
but
either
to
die
or
swim
over
to
africa
already
orlando
had
lost
sight
of
the
bark
distance
and
the
swell
of
the
sea
completely
hid
it
from
his
sight
he
continued
to
press
his
horse
forward
till
at
last
it
could
struggle
no
more
and
sunk
beneath
him
orlando
nowise
concerned
stretched
out
his
nervous
arms
puffing
the
salt
water
from
before
his
mouth
and
carried
his
head
above
the
waves
fortunately
they
were
not
rough
scarce
a
breath
of
wind
agitated
the
surface
otherwise
the
invincible
orlando
would
then
have
met
his
death
but
fortune
which
it
is
said
favors
fools
delivered
him
from
this
danger
and
landed
him
safe
on
the
shore
of
ceuta
here
he
rambled
along
the
shore
till
he
came
to
where
the
black
army
of
astolpho
held
its
camp
now
it
happened
just
before
this
time
that
a
vessel
filled
with
prisoners
which
rodomont
had
taken
at
the
bridge
had
arrived
and
not
knowing
of
the
presence
of
the
abyssinian
army
had
sailed
right
into
port
where
of
course
the
prisoners
and
their
captors
changed
places
the
former
being
set
at
liberty
and
received
with
all
joy
the
latter
sent
to
serve
in
the
galleys
astolpho
thus
found
himself
surrounded
with
christian
knights
and
he
and
his
friends
were
exchanging
greetings
and
felicitations
when
a
noise
was
heard
in
the
camp
and
seemed
to
increase
every
moment
astolpho
and
his
friends
seized
their
weapons
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
to
the
quarter
whence
the
noise
proceeded
imagine
their
astonishment
when
they
saw
that
the
tumult
was
caused
by
a
single
man
perfectly
naked
and
browned
with
dirt
and
exposure
but
of
a
force
and
fury
so
terrible
that
he
overturned
all
that
offered
to
lay
hands
on
him
astolpho
dudon
oliver
and
florimart
gazed
at
him
with
amazement
it
was
with
difficulty
they
knew
him
astolpho
who
had
been
warned
of
his
condition
by
his
holy
monitor
was
the
first
to
recognize
him
as
the
paladins
closed
round
orlando
the
madman
dealt
one
and
another
a
blow
of
his
fist
which
if
they
had
not
been
in
armor
or
he
had
had
any
weapon
would
probably
have
despatched
them
as
it
was
dudon
and
astolpho
measured
their
length
on
the
sand
but
florimart
seized
him
from
behind
sansonnet
and
another
grasped
his
legs
and
at
last
they
succeeded
in
securing
him
with
ropes
they
took
him
to
the
and
washed
him
well
and
then
astolpho
having
first
bandaged
his
mouth
so
that
he
could
not
breathe
except
through
his
nose
brought
the
precious
phial
uncorked
it
and
placed
it
adroitly
under
his
nostrils
when
the
good
orlando
took
it
all
up
in
one
breath
o
marvellous
prodigy
the
paladin
recovered
in
an
instant
all
his
intelligence
he
felt
like
one
who
had
awakened
from
a
painful
dream
in
which
he
had
believed
that
monsters
were
about
to
tear
him
to
pieces
he
seemed
prostrated
silent
and
abashed
florismart
oliver
and
astolpho
stood
gazing
upon
him
while
he
turned
his
eyes
around
and
on
himself
he
seemed
surprised
to
find
himself
naked
bound
and
stretched
on
the
after
a
few
moments
he
recognized
his
friends
and
spoke
to
them
in
a
tone
so
tender
that
they
hastened
to
unbind
him
and
to
supply
him
with
garments
then
they
exerted
themselves
to
console
him
to
diminish
the
weight
with
which
his
spirits
were
oppressed
and
to
make
him
forget
the
wretched
condition
into
which
he
had
been
sunk
orlando
in
recovering
his
reason
found
himself
also
delivered
from
his
insane
attachment
to
the
queen
of
cathay
his
heart
felt
now
no
further
influenced
by
the
recollection
of
her
than
to
be
moved
with
an
ardent
desire
to
retrieve
his
fame
by
some
distinguished
exploit
astolpho
would
gladly
have
yielded
to
him
the
chief
command
of
the
army
but
orlando
would
not
take
from
the
friend
to
whom
he
owed
so
much
the
glory
of
the
campaign
but
in
everything
the
two
paladins
acted
in
concert
and
united
their
counsels
they
proposed
to
make
a
general
assault
on
the
city
of
biserta
and
were
only
waiting
a
favorable
moment
when
their
plan
was
interrupted
by
new
events
agramant
after
the
bloody
battle
which
followed
the
infraction
of
the
truce
found
himself
so
weak
that
he
saw
it
was
in
vain
to
attempt
to
remain
in
france
so
in
concert
with
sobrino
the
bravest
and
most
trusted
of
his
chiefs
he
embarked
to
return
to
his
own
country
having
previously
sent
off
his
few
remaining
troops
in
the
same
direction
the
vessel
which
carried
agramant
and
sobrino
approached
the
shore
where
the
army
of
astolpho
lay
encamped
before
biserta
and
having
discovered
this
fact
before
it
was
too
late
the
king
commanded
the
pilot
to
steer
eastward
with
a
view
to
seek
protection
of
the
king
of
egypt
but
the
weather
becoming
rough
he
consented
to
the
advice
of
his
companions
and
sought
harbor
in
an
island
which
lies
between
sicily
and
africa
there
he
found
gradasso
the
warlike
king
of
sericane
who
had
come
to
france
to
possess
himself
of
the
horse
bayard
and
the
sword
durindana
and
having
procured
both
these
prizes
was
returning
to
his
own
country
the
two
kings
who
had
been
companions
in
arms
under
the
walls
of
paris
embraced
one
another
affectionately
gradasso
learned
with
regret
the
reverses
of
agramant
and
offered
him
his
troops
and
his
person
he
strongly
deprecated
resorting
to
egypt
for
aid
remember
the
great
pompey
said
he
and
shun
that
fatal
shore
my
plan
he
continued
is
this
i
mean
to
challenge
orlando
to
single
combat
possessed
of
such
a
sword
and
steed
as
mine
if
he
were
made
of
steel
or
bronze
he
could
not
escape
me
he
being
removed
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
driving
back
the
abyssinians
we
will
rouse
against
them
the
moslem
nations
from
the
other
side
of
the
nile
the
arabians
persians
and
chaldeans
who
will
soon
make
senapus
recall
his
army
to
defend
his
own
territories
agramant
approved
this
advice
except
in
one
particular
it
is
for
me
said
he
to
combat
orlando
i
can
not
with
honor
devolve
that
duty
on
another
let
us
adopt
a
third
course
said
the
aged
warrior
sobrino
i
would
not
willingly
remain
a
simple
spectator
of
such
a
contest
let
us
send
three
squires
to
the
shore
of
africa
to
challenge
orlando
and
any
two
of
his
companions
in
arms
to
meet
us
three
in
this
island
of
lampedusa
this
counsel
was
adopted
the
three
squires
sped
on
their
way
and
now
presented
themselves
and
rehearsed
their
message
to
the
christian
knights
orlando
was
delighted
and
rewarded
the
squires
with
rich
gifts
he
had
already
resolved
to
seek
gradasso
and
compel
him
to
restore
durindana
which
he
had
learned
was
in
his
possession
for
his
two
companions
the
count
chose
his
faithful
friend
florismart
and
his
cousin
oliver
the
three
warriors
embarked
and
sailing
with
a
favorable
wind
the
second
morning
showed
them
on
their
right
the
island
where
this
important
battle
was
to
be
fought
orlando
and
his
two
companions
having
landed
pitched
their
tent
agramant
had
placed
his
opposite
next
morning
as
soon
as
aurora
brightened
the
edges
of
the
horizon
the
warriors
of
both
parties
armed
themselves
and
mounted
their
horses
they
took
their
positions
face
to
face
lowered
their
lances
placed
them
in
rest
clapped
spurs
to
their
horses
and
flew
to
the
charge
orlando
met
the
charge
of
gradasso
the
paladin
was
unmoved
but
his
horse
could
not
sustain
the
terrible
shock
of
bayard
he
recoiled
staggered
and
fell
some
paces
behind
orlando
tried
to
raise
him
but
finding
his
efforts
unavailing
seized
his
shield
and
drew
his
famous
balisardo
meanwhile
agramant
and
the
brave
oliver
gained
no
advantage
one
or
the
other
but
florismart
unhorsed
the
king
sobrino
having
brought
his
foe
to
the
ground
he
would
not
pursue
his
victory
but
hastened
to
attack
gradasso
who
had
overthrown
orlando
seeing
him
thus
engaged
orlando
would
not
interfere
but
ran
with
sword
upraised
upon
sobrino
and
with
one
blow
deprived
him
of
sense
and
motion
believing
him
dead
he
next
turned
to
aid
his
beloved
florismart
that
brave
paladin
neither
in
horse
nor
arms
equal
to
his
antagonist
could
but
parry
and
evade
the
blows
of
the
terrible
durindana
orlando
eager
to
succor
him
was
delayed
for
a
moment
in
securing
and
mounting
the
horse
of
the
king
sobrino
it
was
but
an
instant
and
with
sword
upraised
he
rushed
upon
gradasso
who
noways
disconcerted
at
the
onset
of
this
second
foe
shouted
his
defiance
and
thrust
at
him
with
his
sword
but
having
miscalculated
the
distance
scarcely
reached
him
and
failed
to
pierce
his
mail
orlando
in
return
dealt
him
a
blow
with
balisardo
which
wounded
as
it
fell
face
breast
and
thigh
and
if
he
had
been
a
little
nearer
would
have
cleft
him
in
twain
sobrino
by
this
time
recovered
from
his
swoon
though
severely
wounded
raised
himself
on
his
legs
and
looked
to
see
how
he
might
aid
his
friends
observing
agramant
hard
pressed
by
oliver
he
thrust
his
sword
into
the
bowels
of
the
latter
horse
which
fell
and
bore
down
his
master
entangling
his
leg
as
he
fell
so
that
oliver
could
not
extricate
himself
florismart
saw
the
danger
of
his
friend
and
ran
upon
sobrino
with
his
horse
overthrew
him
and
then
turned
to
defend
himself
from
agramant
they
were
not
unequally
matched
for
though
agramant
mounted
on
brigliadoro
had
an
advantage
over
florismart
whose
horse
was
but
indifferent
yet
agramant
had
received
a
serious
wound
in
his
encounter
with
oliver
nothing
could
exceed
the
fury
of
the
encounter
between
orlando
and
gradasso
durindana
in
the
hands
of
gradasso
clove
asunder
whatever
it
struck
but
such
was
the
skill
of
orlando
who
perfectly
knew
the
danger
to
which
he
was
exposed
from
a
stroke
of
that
weapon
it
had
not
yet
struck
him
in
such
a
way
as
to
inflict
a
wound
meanwhile
gradasso
was
bleeding
from
many
wounds
and
his
rage
and
incaution
increased
every
moment
in
his
desperation
he
lifted
durindana
with
both
hands
and
struck
so
terrible
a
blow
full
on
the
helmet
of
orlando
that
for
a
moment
it
stunned
the
paladin
he
dropped
the
reins
and
his
frightened
horse
scoured
with
him
over
the
plain
gradasso
turned
to
pursue
him
but
at
that
moment
saw
florismart
in
the
very
act
of
striking
a
fatal
blow
at
agramant
whom
he
had
unhorsed
while
florismart
was
wholly
intent
upon
completing
his
victory
gradasso
plunged
his
sword
into
his
side
florismart
fell
from
his
horse
and
bathed
the
plain
with
his
blood
orlando
recovered
himself
just
in
time
to
see
the
deed
whether
rage
or
grief
predominated
in
his
breast
i
can
not
tell
but
seizing
balisardo
with
fury
his
first
blow
fell
upon
agramant
who
was
nearest
to
him
and
smote
his
head
from
his
shoulders
at
this
sight
gradasso
for
the
first
time
felt
his
courage
sink
and
a
dark
presentiment
of
death
came
over
him
he
hardly
stood
on
his
defence
when
orlando
cast
himself
upon
him
and
gave
him
a
fatal
thrust
the
sword
penetrated
his
ribs
and
came
out
a
palm
breadth
on
the
other
side
of
his
body
thus
fell
beneath
the
sword
of
the
most
illustrious
paladin
of
france
the
bravest
warrior
of
the
saracen
host
orlando
then
as
if
despising
his
victory
leaped
lightly
to
the
ground
and
ran
to
his
dear
friend
florismart
embraced
him
and
bathed
him
with
his
tears
florismart
still
breathed
he
could
even
command
his
voice
to
utter
a
few
parting
words
dear
friend
do
not
forget
me
give
me
your
prayers
and
oh
be
a
brother
to
flordelis
he
died
in
uttering
her
name
after
a
few
moments
given
to
grief
orlando
turned
to
look
for
his
other
companion
and
his
late
foes
oliver
lay
oppressed
with
the
weight
of
his
horse
from
which
he
had
in
vain
struggled
to
liberate
himself
orlando
extricated
him
with
difficulty
he
then
raised
sobrino
from
the
earth
and
committed
him
to
his
squire
treating
him
as
gently
as
if
he
had
been
his
own
brother
for
this
terrible
warrior
was
the
most
generous
of
men
to
a
fallen
foe
he
took
bayard
and
brigliadoro
with
the
arms
of
the
conquered
knights
their
bodies
and
their
other
spoils
he
remitted
to
their
attendants
but
who
can
tell
the
grief
of
flordelis
when
she
saw
the
warriors
return
and
found
not
florismart
as
usual
after
absence
hasten
to
her
side
she
knew
by
the
aspect
of
the
others
that
her
lord
was
slain
at
the
thought
and
before
the
question
could
pass
her
lips
she
fell
senseless
upon
the
ground
when
life
returned
and
she
learned
the
truth
of
her
worst
fears
she
bitterly
upbraided
herself
that
she
had
let
him
depart
without
her
i
might
have
saved
him
by
a
single
cry
when
his
enemy
dealt
him
that
treacherous
blow
or
i
might
have
thrown
myself
between
and
given
my
worthless
life
for
his
or
if
no
more
i
might
have
heard
his
last
words
i
might
have
given
him
a
last
kiss
so
she
lamented
and
could
not
be
comforted
rogero
and
bradamante
after
the
interruption
of
the
combat
with
rinaldo
as
we
have
related
rogero
was
perplexed
with
doubts
what
course
to
take
the
terms
of
the
treaty
required
him
to
abandon
agramant
who
had
broken
it
and
to
transfer
his
allegiance
to
charlemagne
and
his
love
for
bradamante
called
him
in
the
same
direction
but
unwillingness
to
desert
his
prince
and
leader
in
the
hour
of
distress
forbade
this
course
embarking
therefore
for
africa
he
took
his
way
to
rejoin
the
saracen
army
but
was
arrested
midway
by
a
storm
which
drove
the
vessel
on
a
rock
the
crew
took
to
their
boat
but
that
was
quickly
swamped
in
the
waves
and
rogero
with
the
rest
were
compelled
to
swim
for
their
lives
then
while
buffeting
the
waves
rogero
bethought
him
of
his
sin
in
so
long
delaying
his
christian
profession
and
vowed
in
his
heart
that
if
he
should
live
to
reach
the
land
he
would
no
longer
delay
to
be
baptized
his
vows
were
heard
and
answered
he
succeeded
in
reaching
the
shore
and
was
aided
and
relieved
on
landing
by
a
pious
hermit
whose
cell
overlooked
the
sea
from
him
he
received
baptism
having
first
passed
some
days
with
him
partaking
his
humble
fare
and
receiving
instruction
in
the
doctrines
of
the
christian
faith
while
these
things
were
going
on
rinaldo
who
had
set
out
on
his
way
to
seek
gradasso
and
recover
bayard
from
him
hearing
on
his
way
of
the
great
things
which
were
doing
in
africa
repaired
thither
to
bear
his
part
in
them
he
arrived
too
late
to
do
more
than
join
his
friends
in
lamenting
the
loss
of
florismart
and
to
rejoice
with
them
in
their
victory
over
the
pagan
knights
on
the
death
of
their
king
the
africans
gave
up
the
contest
biserta
submitted
and
the
christian
knights
had
only
to
dismiss
their
forces
and
return
home
astolpho
took
leave
of
his
abyssinian
army
and
sent
them
back
laden
with
spoil
to
their
own
country
not
forgetting
to
intrust
to
them
the
bag
which
held
the
winds
by
means
of
which
they
were
enabled
to
cross
the
sandy
desert
again
without
danger
and
did
not
untie
it
till
they
reached
their
own
country
orlando
now
with
oliver
who
much
needed
the
surgeon
care
and
sobrino
to
whom
equal
attention
was
shown
sailed
in
a
swift
vessel
to
sicily
bearing
with
him
the
body
of
florismart
to
be
laid
in
christian
earth
rinaldo
accompanied
them
as
did
sansonnet
and
the
other
christian
leaders
arrived
at
sicily
the
funeral
was
solemnized
with
all
the
rites
of
religion
and
with
the
profound
grief
of
those
who
had
known
florismart
or
had
heard
of
his
fame
then
they
resumed
their
course
steering
for
marseilles
but
oliver
wound
grew
worse
instead
of
better
and
his
sufferings
so
distressed
his
friends
that
they
conferred
together
not
knowing
what
to
do
then
said
the
pilot
we
are
not
far
from
an
isle
where
a
holy
hermit
dwells
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
it
is
said
none
seek
his
counsel
or
his
aid
in
vain
he
hath
wrought
marvellous
cures
and
if
you
resort
to
that
holy
man
without
doubt
he
can
heal
the
knight
orlando
bade
him
steer
thither
and
soon
the
bark
was
laid
safely
beside
the
lonely
rock
the
wounded
man
was
lowered
into
their
boat
and
carried
by
the
crew
to
the
hermit
cell
it
was
the
same
hermit
with
whom
rogero
had
taken
refuge
after
his
shipwreck
by
whom
he
had
been
baptized
and
with
whom
he
was
now
staying
absorbed
in
sacred
studies
and
meditations
the
holy
man
received
orlando
and
the
rest
with
kindness
and
inquired
their
errand
and
being
told
that
they
had
come
for
help
for
one
who
warring
for
the
christian
faith
was
brought
to
perilous
pass
by
a
sad
wound
he
straightway
undertook
the
cure
his
applications
were
simple
but
they
were
seconded
by
his
prayers
the
paladin
was
soon
relieved
from
pain
and
in
a
few
days
his
foot
was
perfectly
restored
to
soundness
sobrino
as
soon
as
he
perceived
the
holy
monk
perform
that
wonder
cast
aside
his
false
prophet
and
with
contrite
heart
owned
the
true
god
and
demanded
baptism
at
his
hands
the
hermit
granted
his
request
and
also
by
his
prayers
restored
him
to
health
while
all
the
christian
knights
rejoiced
in
his
conversion
almost
as
much
as
at
the
restoration
of
oliver
more
than
all
rogero
felt
joy
and
gratitude
and
daily
grew
in
grace
and
faith
rogero
was
known
by
fame
to
all
the
christian
knights
but
not
even
rinaldo
knew
him
by
sight
though
he
had
proved
his
prowess
in
combat
sobrino
made
him
known
to
them
and
great
was
the
joy
of
all
when
they
found
one
whose
valor
and
courtesy
were
renowned
through
the
world
no
longer
an
enemy
and
unbeliever
but
a
convert
and
champion
of
the
true
faith
all
press
about
the
knight
one
grasps
his
hand
another
locks
him
fast
in
his
embrace
but
more
than
all
the
rest
rinaldo
cherished
him
for
he
more
than
any
knew
his
worth
it
was
not
long
before
rogero
confided
to
his
friend
the
hopes
he
entertained
of
a
union
with
his
sister
and
rinaldo
frankly
gave
his
sanction
to
the
proposal
but
causes
unknown
to
the
paladin
were
at
that
very
time
interposing
obstacles
to
its
success
the
fame
of
the
beauty
and
worth
of
bradamante
had
reached
the
ears
of
the
grecian
emperor
constantine
and
he
had
sent
to
charlemagne
to
demand
the
hand
of
his
niece
for
leo
his
son
and
the
heir
to
his
dominions
duke
aymon
her
father
had
only
reserved
his
consent
until
he
should
first
have
spoken
with
his
son
rinaldo
now
absent
the
warriors
now
prepared
to
resume
their
voyage
rogero
took
a
tender
farewell
of
the
good
hermit
who
had
taught
him
the
true
faith
orlando
restored
to
him
the
horse
and
arms
which
were
rightly
his
not
even
asserting
his
claim
to
balisarda
that
sword
which
he
himself
had
won
from
the
enchantress
the
hermit
gave
his
blessing
to
the
band
and
they
reembarked
the
passage
was
speedy
and
very
soon
they
arrived
in
the
harbor
of
marseilles
astolpho
when
he
had
dismissed
his
troops
mounted
the
hippogriff
and
at
one
flight
shot
over
to
sardinia
thence
to
corsica
thence
turning
slightly
to
the
left
hovered
over
provence
and
alighted
in
the
neighborhood
of
marseilles
there
he
did
what
he
had
been
commanded
to
do
by
the
holy
saint
he
unbridled
the
hippogriff
and
turned
him
loose
to
seek
his
own
retreats
never
more
to
be
galled
with
saddle
or
bit
the
horn
had
lost
its
marvellous
power
ever
since
the
visit
to
the
moon
astolpho
reached
marseilles
the
very
day
when
orlando
rinaldo
oliver
sobrino
and
rogero
arrived
there
charles
had
already
heard
the
news
of
the
defeat
of
the
saracen
kings
and
all
the
accompanying
events
on
learning
the
approach
of
the
gallant
knights
he
sent
forward
some
of
his
most
illustrious
nobles
to
receive
them
and
himself
with
the
rest
of
his
court
kings
dukes
and
peers
the
queen
and
a
fair
and
gorgeous
band
of
ladies
set
forward
from
arles
to
meet
them
no
sooner
were
the
mutual
greetings
interchanged
than
orlando
and
his
friends
led
forward
rogero
and
presented
him
to
the
emperor
they
vouch
him
son
of
rogero
duke
of
risa
one
of
the
most
renowned
of
christian
warriors
by
adverse
fortune
stolen
in
his
infancy
and
brought
up
by
saracens
in
the
false
faith
now
by
a
kind
providence
converted
and
restored
to
fill
the
place
his
father
once
held
among
the
foremost
champions
of
the
throne
and
church
rogero
had
alighted
from
his
horse
and
stood
respectfully
before
the
emperor
charlemagne
bade
him
remount
and
ride
beside
him
and
omitted
nothing
which
might
do
him
honor
in
sight
of
his
martial
train
with
pomp
triumphal
and
with
festive
cheer
the
troop
returned
to
the
city
the
streets
were
decorated
with
garlands
the
houses
hung
with
rich
tapestry
and
flowers
fell
like
rain
upon
the
conquering
host
from
the
hands
of
fair
dames
and
damsels
from
every
balcony
and
window
so
welcomed
the
mighty
emperor
passed
on
till
he
reached
the
royal
palace
where
many
days
he
feasted
high
in
hall
with
his
lords
amid
tourney
revel
dance
and
song
when
rinaldo
told
his
father
duke
aymon
how
he
had
promised
his
sister
to
rogero
his
father
heard
him
with
indignation
having
set
his
heart
on
seeing
her
united
to
the
grecian
emperor
son
the
lady
beatrice
her
mother
also
appealed
to
bradamante
herself
to
reject
a
knight
who
had
neither
title
nor
lands
and
give
the
preference
to
one
who
would
make
her
empress
of
the
wide
levant
but
bradamante
though
respect
forbade
her
to
refuse
her
mother
entreaty
would
not
promise
to
do
what
her
heart
repelled
and
answered
only
with
a
sigh
until
she
was
alone
and
then
gave
a
loose
to
tears
meanwhile
rogero
indignant
that
a
stranger
should
presume
to
rob
him
of
his
bride
determined
to
seek
the
prince
of
greece
and
defy
him
to
mortal
combat
with
this
design
he
donned
his
armor
but
exchanged
his
crest
and
emblazonment
and
bore
instead
a
white
unicorn
upon
a
crimson
field
he
chose
a
trusty
squire
and
commanding
him
not
to
address
him
as
rogero
rode
on
his
quest
having
crossed
the
rhine
and
the
austrian
countries
into
hungary
he
followed
the
course
of
the
danube
till
he
reached
belgrade
there
he
saw
the
imperial
ensigns
spread
and
white
pavilions
thronged
with
troops
before
the
town
for
the
emperor
constantine
was
laying
siege
to
the
city
to
recover
it
from
the
bulgarians
who
had
taken
it
from
him
not
long
before
a
river
flowed
between
the
camp
of
the
emperor
and
the
bulgarians
and
at
the
moment
when
rogero
approached
a
skirmish
had
begun
between
the
parties
from
either
camp
who
had
approached
the
stream
for
the
purpose
of
watering
the
greeks
in
that
affray
were
four
to
one
and
drove
back
the
bulgarians
in
precipitate
rout
rogero
seeing
this
and
animated
only
by
his
hatred
of
the
grecian
prince
dashed
into
the
middle
of
the
flying
mass
calling
aloud
on
the
fugitives
to
turn
he
encountered
first
a
leader
of
the
grecian
host
in
splendid
armor
a
nephew
of
the
emperor
as
dear
to
him
as
a
son
rogero
lance
pierced
shield
and
armor
and
stretched
the
warrior
breathless
on
the
plain
another
and
another
fell
before
him
and
astonishment
and
terror
arrested
the
advance
of
the
greeks
while
the
bulgarians
catching
courage
from
the
cavalier
rally
change
front
and
chase
the
grecian
troops
who
fly
in
their
turn
leo
the
prince
was
at
a
distance
when
this
sudden
skirmish
rose
but
not
so
far
but
that
he
could
see
distinctly
from
an
elevated
position
which
he
held
how
the
changed
battle
was
all
the
work
of
one
man
and
could
not
choose
but
admire
the
bravery
and
prowess
with
which
it
was
done
he
knew
by
the
blazonry
displayed
that
the
champion
was
not
of
the
bulgarian
army
though
he
furnished
aid
to
them
although
he
suffered
by
his
valor
the
prince
could
not
wish
him
ill
for
his
admiration
surpassed
his
resentment
by
this
time
the
greeks
had
regained
the
river
and
crossing
it
by
fording
or
swimming
some
made
their
escape
leaving
many
more
prisoners
in
the
hands
of
the
bulgarians
rogero
learning
from
some
of
the
captives
that
leo
was
at
a
point
some
distance
down
the
river
rode
thither
with
a
view
to
meet
him
but
arrived
not
before
the
greek
prince
had
retired
beyond
the
stream
and
broken
up
the
bridge
day
was
spent
and
rogero
wearied
looked
round
for
a
shelter
for
the
night
he
found
it
in
a
cottage
where
he
soon
yielded
himself
to
repose
it
so
happened
a
knight
who
had
narrowly
escaped
rogero
sword
in
the
late
battle
also
found
shelter
in
the
same
cottage
and
recognizing
the
armor
of
the
unknown
knight
easily
found
means
of
securing
him
as
he
slept
and
next
morning
carried
him
in
chains
and
delivered
him
to
the
emperor
by
him
he
was
in
turn
delivered
to
his
sister
theodora
mother
of
the
young
knight
the
first
victim
of
rogero
spear
by
her
he
was
cast
into
a
dungeon
till
her
ingenuity
could
devise
a
death
sufficiently
painful
to
satiate
her
revenge
bradamante
meanwhile
to
escape
her
father
and
mother
importunity
had
begged
a
boon
of
charlemagne
which
the
monarch
pledged
his
royal
word
to
grant
it
was
that
she
should
not
be
compelled
to
marry
any
one
unless
he
should
first
vanquish
her
in
single
combat
the
emperor
therefore
proclaimed
a
tournament
in
these
words
he
that
would
wed
duke
aymon
daughter
must
contend
with
the
sword
against
that
dame
from
the
sun
rise
to
his
setting
and
if
in
that
time
he
is
not
overcome
the
lady
shall
be
his
duke
aymon
and
the
lady
beatrice
though
much
incensed
at
the
course
things
had
taken
brought
their
daughter
to
court
to
await
the
day
appointed
for
the
tournament
bradamante
not
finding
there
him
whom
her
heart
required
distressed
herself
with
doubts
what
could
be
the
cause
of
his
absence
of
all
fancies
the
most
painful
one
was
that
he
had
gone
away
to
learn
to
forget
her
knowing
her
father
and
her
mother
opposition
to
their
union
and
despairing
to
contend
against
them
but
oh
how
much
worse
would
be
the
maiden
woe
if
it
were
known
to
her
what
her
betrothed
was
then
enduring
he
was
plunged
in
a
dungeon
where
no
ray
of
daylight
ever
penetrated
loaded
with
chains
and
scantily
supplied
with
the
coarsest
food
no
wonder
despair
took
possession
of
his
heart
and
he
longed
for
death
as
a
relief
when
one
night
or
one
day
for
both
were
equally
dark
to
him
he
was
roused
with
the
glare
of
a
torch
and
saw
two
men
enter
his
cell
it
was
the
prince
leo
with
an
attendant
who
had
come
as
soon
as
he
had
learned
the
wretched
fate
of
the
brave
knight
whose
valor
he
had
seen
and
admired
on
the
field
of
battle
cavalier
said
he
i
am
one
whom
thy
valor
hath
so
bound
to
thee
that
i
willingly
peril
my
own
safety
to
lend
thee
aid
infinite
thanks
i
owe
you
replied
rogero
and
the
life
you
give
me
i
promise
faithfully
to
render
back
upon
your
call
and
promptly
to
stake
it
at
all
times
for
your
service
the
prince
then
told
rogero
his
name
and
rank
at
hearing
which
a
tide
of
contending
emotions
almost
overwhelmed
rogero
he
was
set
at
liberty
and
had
his
horse
and
arms
restored
to
him
meanwhile
tidings
arrived
of
king
charles
decree
that
whoever
aspired
to
the
hand
of
bradamante
must
first
encounter
her
with
sword
and
lance
this
news
made
the
grecian
prince
turn
pale
for
he
knew
he
was
no
match
for
her
in
fight
communing
with
himself
he
sees
how
he
may
make
his
wit
supply
the
place
of
valor
and
employ
the
french
knight
whose
name
was
still
unknown
to
him
to
fight
the
battle
for
him
rogero
heard
the
proposal
with
extreme
distress
yet
it
seemed
worse
than
death
to
deny
the
first
request
of
one
to
whom
he
owed
his
life
hastily
he
gave
his
assent
to
do
in
all
things
that
which
leo
should
command
afterward
bitter
repentance
came
over
him
yet
rather
than
confess
his
change
of
mind
death
itself
would
be
welcome
death
seems
his
only
remedy
but
how
to
die
sometimes
he
thinks
to
make
none
but
a
feigned
resistance
and
allow
her
sword
a
ready
access
for
never
can
death
come
more
happily
than
if
her
hand
guide
the
weapon
yet
this
will
not
avail
for
unless
he
wins
the
maid
for
the
greek
prince
his
debt
remains
unpaid
he
had
promised
to
maintain
a
real
not
a
feigned
encounter
he
will
then
keep
his
word
and
banish
every
thought
from
his
bosom
except
that
which
moved
him
to
maintain
his
truth
the
young
prince
richly
attended
set
out
and
with
him
rogero
they
arrived
at
paris
but
leo
preferred
not
to
enter
the
city
and
pitched
his
tents
without
the
walls
making
known
his
arrival
to
charlemagne
by
an
embassy
the
monarch
was
pleased
and
testified
his
courtesy
by
visits
and
gifts
the
prince
set
forth
the
purpose
of
his
coming
and
prayed
the
emperor
to
dispatch
his
suit
to
send
forth
the
damsel
who
refused
ever
to
take
in
wedlock
any
lord
inferior
to
herself
in
fight
for
she
should
be
his
bride
or
he
would
perish
beneath
her
sword
rogero
passed
the
night
before
the
day
assigned
for
the
battle
like
that
which
the
felon
spends
condemned
to
pay
the
forfeit
of
his
life
on
the
ensuing
day
he
chose
to
fight
with
sword
only
and
on
foot
for
he
would
not
let
her
see
frontino
knowing
that
she
would
recognize
the
steed
nor
would
he
use
balisarda
for
against
that
enchanted
blade
all
armor
would
be
of
no
avail
and
the
sword
that
he
did
take
he
hammered
well
upon
the
edge
to
abate
its
sharpness
he
wore
the
surcoat
of
prince
leo
and
his
shield
emblazoned
with
a
golden
eagle
the
prince
took
care
to
let
himself
be
seen
by
none
bradamante
meanwhile
prepared
herself
for
the
combat
far
differently
instead
of
blunting
the
edge
of
her
falchion
she
whets
the
steel
and
would
fain
infuse
into
it
her
own
acerbity
as
the
moment
approached
she
seemed
to
have
fire
within
her
veins
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
trumpet
sound
at
the
signal
she
drew
her
sword
and
fell
with
fury
upon
her
rogero
but
as
a
wall
or
aged
rock
stands
unmoved
the
fury
of
the
storm
so
rogero
clad
in
those
arms
which
trojan
hector
once
wore
withstood
the
strokes
which
stormed
about
his
head
and
breast
and
flank
sparks
flew
from
his
shield
his
helm
his
cuirass
from
direct
and
back
strokes
aimed
now
high
now
low
falling
thick
and
fast
like
hailstones
on
a
cottage
roof
but
rogero
with
skilful
ward
turns
them
aside
or
receives
them
where
his
armor
is
a
sure
protection
careful
only
to
protect
himself
and
with
no
thought
of
striking
in
return
thus
the
hours
passed
away
and
as
the
sun
approached
the
west
the
damsel
began
to
despair
but
so
much
the
more
her
anger
increases
and
she
redoubles
her
efforts
like
the
craftsman
who
sees
his
work
unfinished
while
the
day
is
wellnigh
spent
o
miserable
damsel
didst
thou
know
whom
thou
wouldst
kill
if
in
that
cavalier
matched
against
thee
thou
didst
but
know
rogero
on
whom
thy
very
hang
rather
than
kill
him
thou
wouldst
kill
thyself
for
he
is
dearer
to
thee
than
life
king
charles
and
the
peers
who
thought
the
cavalier
to
be
the
grecian
prince
viewing
such
force
and
skill
exhibited
and
how
without
assaulting
her
the
knight
defended
himself
were
filled
with
admiration
and
declared
the
champions
well
matched
and
worthy
of
each
other
when
the
sun
was
set
charlemagne
gave
the
signal
for
terminating
the
contest
and
bradamante
was
awarded
to
prince
leo
as
a
bride
rogero
in
deep
distress
returned
to
his
tent
there
leo
unlaced
his
helmet
and
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
henceforth
said
he
do
with
me
as
you
please
for
you
can
not
exhaust
my
gratitude
rogero
replied
little
laid
aside
the
ensigns
he
had
worn
and
resumed
the
unicorn
then
hasted
to
withdraw
himself
from
all
eyes
when
it
was
midnight
he
rose
saddled
frontino
and
sallied
from
his
tent
taking
that
direction
which
pleased
his
steed
all
night
he
rode
absorbed
in
bitter
woe
and
called
on
death
as
alone
capable
of
relieving
his
sufferings
at
last
he
entered
a
forest
and
penetrated
into
its
deepest
recesses
there
he
unharnessed
frontino
and
suffered
him
to
wander
where
he
would
then
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
ground
and
poured
forth
such
bitter
wailings
that
the
birds
and
beasts
for
none
else
heard
him
were
moved
to
pity
with
his
cries
not
less
was
the
distress
of
the
lady
bradamante
who
rather
than
wed
any
one
but
rogero
resolved
to
break
her
word
and
defy
kindred
court
and
charlemagne
himself
and
if
nothing
else
would
do
to
die
but
relief
came
from
an
unexpected
quarter
marphisa
sister
of
rogero
was
a
heroine
of
warlike
prowess
equal
to
bradamante
she
had
been
the
confidante
of
their
loves
and
felt
hardly
less
distress
than
themselves
at
seeing
the
perils
which
threatened
their
union
they
are
already
united
by
mutual
vows
she
said
and
in
the
sight
of
heaven
what
more
is
necessary
full
of
this
thought
she
presented
herself
before
charlemagne
and
declared
that
she
herself
was
witness
that
the
maiden
had
spoken
to
rogero
those
words
which
they
who
marry
swear
and
that
the
compact
was
so
sealed
between
the
pair
that
they
were
no
longer
free
nor
could
forsake
the
one
the
other
to
take
another
spouse
this
her
assertion
she
offered
to
prove
in
single
combat
against
prince
leo
or
any
one
else
charlemagne
sadly
perplexed
at
this
commanded
bradamante
to
be
called
and
told
her
what
the
bold
marphisa
had
declared
bradamante
neither
denied
nor
confirmed
the
statement
but
hung
her
head
and
kept
silence
duke
aymon
was
enraged
and
would
fain
have
set
aside
the
pretended
contract
on
the
ground
that
if
made
at
all
it
must
have
been
made
before
rogero
was
baptized
and
therefore
void
but
not
so
thought
rinaldo
nor
the
good
orlando
and
charlemagne
knew
not
which
way
to
decide
when
marphisa
spoke
thus
since
no
one
else
can
marry
the
maiden
while
my
brother
lives
let
the
prince
meet
rogero
in
mortal
combat
and
let
him
who
survives
take
her
for
his
bride
this
saying
pleased
the
emperor
and
was
accepted
by
the
prince
for
he
thought
that
by
the
aid
of
his
unknown
champion
he
should
surely
triumph
in
the
fight
proclamation
was
therefore
made
for
rogero
to
appear
and
defend
his
suit
and
leo
on
his
part
caused
search
to
be
made
on
all
sides
for
the
knight
of
the
unicorn
meanwhile
rogero
overwhelmed
with
despair
lay
stretched
on
the
ground
in
the
forest
night
and
day
without
food
courting
death
here
he
was
discovered
by
one
of
leo
people
who
finding
him
resist
all
attempts
to
remove
him
hastened
to
his
master
who
was
not
far
off
and
brought
him
to
the
spot
as
he
approached
he
heard
words
which
convinced
him
that
love
was
the
cause
of
the
knight
despair
but
no
clew
was
given
to
guide
him
to
the
object
of
that
love
stooping
down
the
prince
embraced
the
weeping
warrior
and
in
the
tenderest
accents
said
spare
not
i
entreat
you
to
disclose
the
cause
of
your
distress
for
few
such
desperate
evils
betide
mankind
as
are
wholly
past
cure
it
grieves
me
much
that
you
would
hide
your
grief
from
me
for
i
am
bound
to
you
by
ties
that
nothing
can
undo
tell
me
then
your
grief
and
leave
me
to
try
if
wealth
art
cunning
force
or
persuasion
can
not
relieve
you
if
not
it
will
be
time
enough
after
all
has
been
tried
in
vain
to
die
he
spoke
in
such
moving
accents
that
rogero
could
not
choose
but
yield
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
command
utterance
at
last
he
said
my
lord
when
you
shall
know
me
for
what
i
am
i
doubt
not
you
like
myself
will
be
content
that
i
should
die
know
then
i
am
that
rogero
whom
you
have
so
much
cause
to
hate
and
who
so
hated
you
that
intent
on
putting
you
to
death
he
went
to
seek
you
at
your
father
court
this
i
did
because
i
could
not
submit
to
see
my
promised
bride
borne
off
by
you
but
as
man
proposes
and
god
disposes
your
great
courtesy
well
tried
in
time
of
sore
need
so
moved
my
fixed
resolve
that
i
not
only
laid
aside
the
hate
i
bore
but
purposed
to
be
your
friend
forever
you
then
asked
of
me
to
win
for
you
the
lady
bradamante
which
was
all
one
as
to
demand
of
me
my
heart
and
soul
you
know
whether
i
served
you
faithfully
or
not
yours
is
the
lady
possess
her
in
peace
but
ask
me
not
to
live
to
see
it
be
content
rather
that
i
die
for
vows
have
passed
between
myself
and
her
which
forbid
that
while
i
live
she
can
lawfully
wive
with
another
so
filled
was
gentle
leo
with
astonishment
at
these
words
that
for
a
while
he
stood
silent
with
lips
unmoved
and
steadfast
gaze
like
a
statue
and
the
discovery
that
the
stranger
was
rogero
not
only
abated
not
the
good
will
he
bore
him
but
increased
it
so
that
his
distress
for
what
rogero
suffered
seemed
equal
to
his
own
for
this
and
because
he
would
appear
deservedly
an
emperor
son
and
though
in
other
things
outdone
would
not
be
surpassed
in
courtesy
he
says
rogero
had
i
known
that
day
when
your
matchless
valor
routed
my
troops
that
you
were
rogero
your
virtue
would
have
made
me
your
own
as
then
it
made
me
while
i
knew
not
my
foe
and
i
should
have
no
less
gladly
rescued
you
from
theodora
dungeon
and
if
i
would
willingly
have
done
so
then
how
much
more
gladly
will
i
now
restore
the
gift
of
which
you
would
rob
yourself
to
confer
it
upon
me
the
damsel
is
more
due
to
you
than
to
me
and
though
i
know
her
worth
i
would
forego
not
only
her
but
life
itself
rather
than
distress
a
knight
like
you
this
and
much
more
he
said
to
the
same
intent
till
at
last
rogero
replied
i
yield
and
am
content
to
live
and
thus
a
second
time
owe
my
life
to
you
but
several
days
elapsed
before
rogero
was
so
far
restored
as
to
return
to
the
royal
residence
where
an
embassy
had
arrived
from
the
bulgarian
princes
to
seek
the
knight
of
the
unicorn
and
tender
to
him
the
crown
of
that
country
in
place
of
their
king
fallen
in
battle
thus
were
things
situated
when
prince
leo
leading
by
the
hand
rogero
clad
in
the
battered
armor
in
which
he
had
sustained
the
conflict
with
bradamante
presented
himself
before
the
king
behold
he
said
the
champion
who
maintained
from
dawn
to
setting
sun
the
arduous
contest
he
comes
to
claim
the
guerdon
of
the
fight
king
charlemagne
with
all
his
peerage
stood
amazed
for
all
believed
that
the
grecian
prince
himself
had
fought
with
bradamante
then
stepped
forth
marphisa
and
said
since
rogero
is
not
here
to
assert
his
rights
i
his
sister
undertake
his
cause
and
will
maintain
it
against
whoever
shall
dare
dispute
his
claim
she
said
this
with
so
much
anger
and
disdain
that
the
prince
deemed
it
no
longer
wise
to
feign
and
withdrew
helmet
from
his
brow
saying
behold
him
here
who
can
describe
the
astonishment
and
joy
of
marphisa
she
ran
and
threw
her
arms
about
her
brother
neck
nor
would
give
way
to
let
charlemagne
and
rinaldo
orlando
dudon
and
the
rest
who
crowded
round
embrace
him
and
press
friendly
kisses
on
his
brow
the
joyful
tidings
flew
fast
by
many
a
messenger
to
bradamante
who
in
her
secret
chamber
lay
lamenting
the
blood
that
stagnated
about
her
heart
flowed
at
that
notice
so
fast
that
she
had
wellnigh
died
for
joy
duke
aymon
and
the
lady
beatrice
no
longer
withheld
their
consent
and
pledged
their
daughter
to
the
brave
rogero
before
all
that
gallant
company
now
came
the
bulgarian
ambassadors
and
kneeling
at
the
feet
of
rogero
besought
him
to
return
with
them
to
their
country
where
in
adrianople
the
crown
and
sceptre
were
awaiting
his
acceptance
prince
leo
united
his
persuasions
to
theirs
and
promised
in
his
royal
father
name
that
peace
should
be
restored
on
their
part
rogero
gave
his
consent
and
it
was
surmised
that
none
of
the
virtues
which
shone
so
conspicuously
in
him
so
availed
to
recommend
rogero
to
the
lady
beatrice
as
the
hearing
her
future
saluted
as
a
sovereign
prince
the
battle
of
roncesvalles
after
the
expulsion
of
the
saracens
from
france
charlemagne
led
his
army
into
spain
to
punish
marsilius
the
king
of
that
country
for
having
sided
with
the
african
saracens
in
the
late
war
charlemagne
succeeded
in
all
his
attempts
and
compelled
marsilius
to
submit
and
pay
tribute
to
france
our
readers
will
remember
gano
otherwise
called
gan
or
ganelon
whom
we
mentioned
in
one
of
our
early
chapters
as
an
old
courtier
of
charlemagne
and
a
deadly
enemy
of
orlando
rinaldo
and
all
their
friends
he
had
great
influence
over
charles
from
equality
of
age
and
long
intimacy
and
he
was
not
without
good
qualities
he
was
brave
and
sagacious
but
envious
false
and
treacherous
gan
prevailed
on
charles
to
send
him
as
ambassador
to
marsilius
to
arrange
the
tribute
he
embraced
orlando
over
and
over
again
at
taking
leave
using
such
pains
to
seem
loving
and
sincere
that
his
hypocrisy
was
manifest
to
every
one
but
the
old
monarch
he
fastened
with
equal
tenderness
on
oliver
who
smiled
contemptuously
in
his
face
and
thought
to
himself
you
may
make
as
many
fair
speeches
as
you
choose
but
you
lie
all
the
other
paladins
who
were
present
thought
the
same
and
they
said
as
much
to
the
emperor
adding
that
gan
should
on
no
account
be
sent
ambassador
to
the
spaniards
but
charles
was
infatuated
gan
was
received
with
great
honor
by
marsilius
the
king
attended
by
his
lords
came
fifteen
miles
out
of
saragossa
to
meet
him
and
then
conducted
him
into
the
city
with
acclamations
there
was
nothing
for
several
days
but
balls
games
and
exhibitions
of
chivalry
the
ladies
throwing
flowers
on
the
heads
of
the
french
knights
and
the
people
shouting
france
mountjoy
and
st
denis
after
the
ceremonies
of
the
first
reception
the
king
and
the
ambassador
began
to
understand
one
another
one
day
they
sat
together
in
a
garden
on
the
border
of
a
fountain
the
water
was
so
clear
and
smooth
it
reflected
every
object
around
and
the
spot
was
encircled
with
which
quivered
with
the
fresh
air
as
they
sat
and
talked
as
if
without
restraint
gan
without
looking
the
king
in
the
face
was
enabled
to
see
the
expression
of
his
countenance
in
the
water
and
governed
his
speech
accordingly
marsilius
was
equally
adroit
and
watched
the
face
of
gan
while
he
addressed
him
marsilius
began
by
lamenting
not
as
to
the
ambassador
but
as
to
the
friend
the
injuries
which
charles
had
done
him
by
invading
his
dominions
charging
him
with
wishing
to
take
his
kingdom
from
him
and
give
it
to
orlando
till
at
length
he
plainly
uttered
his
belief
that
if
that
ambitious
paladin
were
but
dead
good
men
would
get
their
rights
gan
heaved
a
sigh
as
if
he
was
unwillingly
compelled
to
allow
the
force
of
what
the
king
said
but
unable
to
contain
himself
long
he
lifted
up
his
face
radiant
with
triumphant
wickedness
and
exclaimed
every
word
you
utter
is
truth
die
he
must
and
die
also
must
oliver
who
struck
me
that
foul
blow
at
court
is
it
treachery
to
punish
affronts
like
these
i
have
planned
everything
i
have
settled
everything
already
with
their
besotted
master
orlando
will
come
to
your
borders
to
roncesvalles
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
the
tribute
charles
will
await
him
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
orlando
will
bring
but
a
small
band
with
him
you
when
you
meet
him
will
have
secretly
your
whole
army
at
your
back
you
surround
him
and
who
receives
tribute
then
the
new
judas
had
scarcely
uttered
these
words
when
his
exultation
was
interrupted
by
a
change
in
the
face
of
nature
the
sky
was
suddenly
overcast
there
was
thunder
and
lightning
a
laurel
was
split
in
two
from
head
to
foot
and
the
under
which
gan
was
sitting
which
is
said
to
be
the
species
of
tree
on
which
judas
iscariot
hung
himself
dropped
one
of
its
pods
on
his
head
marsilius
as
well
as
gan
was
appalled
at
this
omen
but
on
assembling
his
soothsayers
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
turned
the
omen
against
the
emperor
the
successor
of
the
caesars
though
one
of
them
renewed
the
consternation
of
gan
by
saying
that
he
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
the
tree
of
judas
and
intimating
that
perhaps
the
ambassador
could
explain
it
gan
relieved
his
vexation
by
anger
the
habit
of
wickedness
prevailed
over
all
other
considerations
and
the
king
prepared
to
march
to
roncesvalles
at
the
head
of
all
his
forces
gan
wrote
to
charlemagne
to
say
how
humbly
and
submissively
marsilius
was
coming
to
pay
the
tribute
into
the
hands
of
orlando
and
how
handsome
it
would
be
of
the
emperor
to
meet
him
and
so
be
ready
to
receive
him
after
the
payment
at
his
camp
he
added
a
brilliant
account
of
the
tribute
and
the
accompanying
presents
the
good
emperor
wrote
in
turn
to
say
how
pleased
he
was
with
the
ambassador
diligence
and
that
matters
were
arranged
precisely
as
he
wished
his
court
however
had
its
suspicion
still
though
they
little
thought
gan
object
in
bringing
charles
into
the
neighborhood
of
roncesvalles
was
to
deliver
him
into
the
hands
of
marsilius
after
orlando
should
have
been
destroyed
by
him
orlando
however
did
as
his
lord
and
sovereign
desired
he
went
to
roncesvalles
accompanied
by
a
moderate
train
of
warriors
not
dreaming
of
the
atrocity
that
awaited
him
gan
meanwhile
had
hastened
back
to
france
in
order
to
show
himself
free
and
easy
in
the
presence
of
charles
and
secure
the
success
of
his
plot
while
marsilius
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
brought
into
the
passes
of
roncesvalles
no
less
than
three
armies
which
were
successively
to
fall
on
the
paladin
in
case
of
the
worst
and
so
extinguish
him
with
numbers
he
had
also
by
gan
advice
brought
heaps
of
wine
and
good
cheer
to
be
set
before
his
victims
in
the
first
instance
for
that
said
the
traitor
will
render
the
onset
the
more
effective
the
feasters
being
unarmed
one
thing
however
i
must
not
forget
added
he
my
son
baldwin
is
sure
to
be
with
orlando
you
must
take
care
of
his
life
for
my
sake
i
give
him
this
vesture
off
my
own
body
said
the
king
let
him
wear
it
in
the
battle
and
have
no
fear
my
soldiers
shall
be
directed
not
to
touch
him
gan
went
away
rejoicing
to
france
he
embraced
the
sovereign
and
the
court
all
round
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
brought
them
nothing
but
blessings
and
the
old
king
wept
for
very
tenderness
and
delight
something
is
going
on
wrong
and
looks
very
black
thought
malagigi
the
good
wizard
rinaldo
is
not
here
and
it
is
indispensably
necessary
that
he
should
be
i
must
find
out
where
he
is
and
ricciardetto
too
and
send
for
them
with
all
speed
malagigi
called
up
by
his
art
a
wise
terrible
and
cruel
spirit
named
ashtaroth
tell
me
and
tell
me
truly
of
rinaldo
said
malagigi
to
the
spirit
the
demon
looked
hard
at
the
paladin
and
said
nothing
his
aspect
was
clouded
and
violent
the
enchanter
with
an
aspect
still
cloudier
bade
ashtaroth
lay
down
that
look
and
made
signs
as
if
he
would
resort
to
angrier
compulsion
and
the
devil
alarmed
loosened
his
tongue
and
said
you
have
not
told
me
what
you
desire
to
know
of
rinaldo
i
desire
to
know
what
he
has
been
doing
and
where
he
is
he
has
been
conquering
and
baptizing
the
world
east
and
west
said
the
demon
and
is
now
in
egypt
with
ricciardetto
and
what
has
gan
been
plotting
with
marsilius
inquired
malagigi
and
what
is
to
come
of
it
i
know
not
said
the
devil
i
was
not
attending
to
gan
at
the
time
and
we
fallen
spirits
know
not
the
future
all
i
discern
is
that
by
the
signs
and
comets
in
the
heavens
something
dreadful
is
about
to
happen
something
very
strange
treacherous
and
bloody
and
that
gan
has
a
seat
ready
prepared
for
him
in
hell
within
three
days
cried
the
enchanter
loudly
bring
rinaldo
and
ricciardetto
into
the
pass
of
do
it
and
i
hereby
undertake
to
summon
thee
no
more
suppose
they
will
not
trust
themselves
with
me
said
the
spirit
enter
rinaldo
horse
and
bring
him
whether
he
trust
thee
or
not
it
shall
be
done
returned
the
demon
there
was
an
earthquake
and
ashtaroth
disappeared
marsilius
now
made
his
first
movement
towards
the
destruction
of
orlando
by
sending
before
him
his
vassal
king
blanchardin
with
his
presents
of
wines
and
other
luxuries
the
temperate
but
courteous
hero
took
them
in
good
part
and
distributed
them
as
the
traitor
wished
and
then
blanchardin
on
pretence
of
going
forward
to
salute
charlemagne
returned
and
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
second
army
which
was
the
post
assigned
him
by
his
king
falseron
whose
son
orlando
had
slain
in
battle
headed
the
first
army
and
king
balugante
the
third
marsilius
made
a
speech
to
them
in
which
he
let
them
into
his
design
and
concluded
by
recommending
to
their
good
will
the
son
of
his
friend
gan
whom
they
would
know
by
the
vest
he
had
sent
him
and
who
was
the
only
soul
amongst
the
christian
they
were
to
spare
this
son
of
gan
meanwhile
and
several
of
the
paladins
who
distrusted
the
misbelievers
and
were
anxious
at
all
events
to
be
with
orlando
had
joined
the
hero
in
the
fatal
valley
so
that
the
little
christian
host
considering
the
tremendous
valor
of
their
lord
and
his
friends
were
not
to
be
sold
for
nothing
rinaldo
alas
the
second
thunderbolt
of
christendom
was
destined
not
to
be
there
in
time
to
meet
the
issue
the
paladins
in
vain
begged
orlando
to
be
on
his
guard
against
treachery
and
send
for
a
more
numerous
body
of
men
the
great
heart
of
the
champion
of
the
faith
was
unwilling
to
harbor
suspicion
as
long
as
he
could
help
it
he
refused
to
summon
aid
which
might
be
superfluous
neither
would
he
do
anything
but
what
his
had
directed
and
yet
he
could
not
wholly
repress
a
misgiving
a
shadow
had
fallen
on
his
heart
great
and
cheerful
as
it
was
the
anticipations
of
his
friends
disturbed
him
in
spite
of
the
face
with
which
he
met
them
perhaps
by
a
certain
foresight
he
felt
his
death
approaching
but
he
felt
bound
not
to
encourage
the
impression
besides
time
pressed
the
moment
of
the
tribute
was
at
hand
and
little
combinations
of
circumstances
determine
often
the
greatest
events
king
marsilius
was
to
arrive
early
next
day
with
the
tribute
and
oliver
with
the
morning
sun
rode
forth
to
reconnoitre
and
see
if
he
could
discover
the
peaceful
pomp
of
the
spanish
court
in
the
distance
he
rode
up
the
nearest
height
and
from
the
top
of
it
beheld
the
first
army
of
marsilius
already
forming
in
the
passes
o
devil
gan
he
exclaimed
this
then
is
the
consummation
of
thy
labors
oliver
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
galloped
back
down
the
mountain
to
orlando
well
cried
the
hero
what
news
bad
news
said
his
cousin
such
as
you
would
not
hear
of
yesterday
marsilius
is
here
in
arms
and
all
the
world
is
with
him
the
paladins
pressed
round
orlando
and
entreated
him
to
sound
his
horn
in
token
that
he
needed
help
his
only
answer
was
to
mount
his
horse
and
ride
up
the
mountain
with
sansonetto
as
soon
however
as
he
cast
forth
his
eyes
and
beheld
what
was
round
about
him
he
turned
in
sorrow
and
looked
down
into
roncesvalles
and
said
o
miserable
valley
the
blood
shed
in
thee
this
day
will
color
thy
name
forever
orlando
little
camp
were
furious
against
the
saracens
they
armed
themselves
with
the
greatest
impatience
there
was
nothing
but
lacing
of
helmets
and
mounting
of
horses
while
good
archbishop
turpin
went
from
rank
to
rank
exhorting
and
encouraging
the
warriors
of
christ
orlando
and
his
captains
withdrew
for
a
moment
to
consultation
he
fairly
groaned
for
sorrow
and
at
first
had
not
a
word
to
say
so
wretched
he
felt
at
having
brought
his
people
to
die
in
roncesvalles
then
he
said
if
it
had
entered
into
my
heart
to
conceive
the
king
of
spain
to
be
such
a
villain
never
would
you
have
seen
this
day
he
has
exchanged
with
me
a
thousand
courtesies
and
good
words
and
i
thought
that
the
worse
enemies
we
had
been
before
the
better
friends
we
had
become
now
i
fancied
every
human
being
capable
of
this
kind
of
virtue
on
a
good
opportunity
saving
indeed
such
wretches
as
can
never
forgive
their
very
forgivers
and
of
these
i
did
not
suppose
him
to
be
one
let
us
die
if
die
we
must
like
honest
and
gallant
men
so
that
it
shall
be
said
of
us
it
was
only
our
bodies
that
died
the
reason
why
i
did
not
sound
the
horn
was
partly
because
i
thought
it
did
not
become
us
and
partly
because
our
liege
lord
could
hardly
save
us
even
if
he
heard
it
and
with
these
words
orlando
sprang
to
his
horse
crying
aways
against
the
saracens
but
he
had
no
sooner
turned
his
face
than
he
wept
bitterly
and
said
o
holy
virgin
think
not
of
me
the
sinner
orlando
but
have
pity
on
these
thy
servants
and
now
with
a
mighty
dust
and
an
infinite
sound
of
horns
and
tambours
which
came
filling
the
valley
the
first
army
of
the
infidels
made
its
appearance
horses
neighing
and
a
thousand
pennons
flying
in
the
air
king
falseron
led
them
on
saying
to
his
officers
let
nobody
dare
to
lay
a
finger
on
orlando
he
belongs
to
myself
the
revenge
of
my
son
death
is
mine
i
will
cut
the
man
down
that
comes
between
us
now
friends
said
orlando
every
man
for
himself
and
michael
for
us
all
there
is
not
one
here
that
is
not
a
perfect
knight
and
he
might
well
say
it
for
the
flower
of
all
france
was
there
except
rinaldo
and
ricciardetto
every
man
a
picked
man
all
friends
and
constant
companions
of
orlando
so
the
captains
of
the
little
troop
and
of
the
great
army
sat
looking
at
one
another
and
singling
one
another
out
as
the
latter
came
on
and
then
the
knights
put
spear
in
rest
and
ran
for
a
while
two
and
two
in
succession
one
against
the
other
astolpho
was
the
first
to
move
he
ran
against
arlotto
of
sorio
and
thrust
his
antagonist
body
out
of
the
saddle
and
his
soul
into
the
other
world
oliver
encountered
malprimo
and
though
he
received
a
thrust
which
hurt
him
sent
his
lance
right
through
the
heart
of
malprimo
falseron
was
daunted
at
this
blow
truly
thought
he
this
is
a
marvel
oliver
did
not
press
on
among
the
saracens
his
wound
was
too
painful
but
orlando
now
put
himself
and
his
whole
band
in
motion
and
you
may
guess
what
an
uproar
ensued
the
sound
of
the
rattling
of
blows
and
helmets
was
as
if
the
forge
of
vulcan
had
been
thrown
open
falseron
beheld
orlando
coming
so
furiously
that
he
thought
him
a
lucifer
who
had
burst
his
chain
and
was
quite
of
another
mind
than
when
he
purposed
to
have
him
all
to
himself
on
the
contrary
he
recommended
himself
to
his
gods
and
turned
away
meaning
to
wait
for
a
more
auspicious
season
of
revenge
but
orlando
hailed
him
with
a
terrible
voice
saying
o
thou
traitor
was
this
the
end
to
which
old
quarrels
were
made
up
then
he
dashed
at
falseron
with
a
fury
so
swift
and
at
the
same
time
with
a
mastery
of
his
lance
so
marvellous
that
though
he
plunged
it
in
the
man
body
so
as
instantly
to
kill
him
and
then
withdrew
it
the
body
did
not
move
in
the
saddle
the
hero
himself
as
he
rushed
onwards
was
fain
to
see
the
end
of
a
stroke
so
perfect
and
turning
his
horse
back
touched
the
carcass
with
his
sword
and
it
fell
on
the
instant
when
the
infidels
beheld
their
leader
dead
such
fear
fell
upon
them
that
they
were
for
leaving
the
field
to
the
paladins
but
they
were
unable
marsilius
had
drawn
the
rest
of
his
forces
round
the
valley
like
a
net
so
that
their
shoulders
were
turned
in
vain
orlando
rode
into
the
thick
of
them
and
wherever
he
went
thunderbolts
fell
upon
helmets
oliver
was
again
in
the
fray
with
walter
and
baldwin
avino
and
avolio
while
turpin
had
changed
his
crosier
for
a
lance
and
chased
a
new
flock
before
him
to
the
mountains
yet
what
could
be
done
against
foes
without
number
marsilius
constantly
pours
them
in
the
paladins
are
as
units
to
thousands
why
tarry
the
horses
of
rinaldo
and
ricciardetto
the
horses
did
not
tarry
but
fate
had
been
quicker
than
enchantment
ashtaroth
had
presented
himself
to
rinaldo
in
egypt
and
after
telling
his
errand
he
and
his
servant
entered
the
horses
of
rinaldo
and
ricciardetto
which
began
to
neigh
and
snort
and
leap
with
the
fiends
within
them
till
off
they
flew
through
the
air
over
the
pyramids
and
across
the
desert
and
reached
spain
and
the
scene
of
action
just
as
marsilius
brought
up
his
third
army
the
two
paladins
on
their
horses
dropped
right
into
the
midst
of
the
saracens
and
began
making
such
havoc
among
them
that
marsilius
who
overlooked
the
fight
from
a
mountain
thought
his
soldiers
had
turned
against
one
another
orlando
beheld
it
and
guessed
it
could
be
no
other
but
his
cousins
and
pressed
to
meet
them
oliver
coming
up
at
the
same
moment
the
rapture
of
the
whole
party
is
not
to
be
expressed
after
a
few
hasty
words
of
explanation
they
were
forced
to
turn
again
upon
the
enemy
whose
numbers
seemed
perfectly
without
limit
orlando
making
a
bloody
passage
towards
marsilius
struck
a
youth
on
the
head
whose
helmet
was
so
strong
as
to
resist
the
blow
but
at
the
same
time
flew
off
orlando
prepared
to
strike
a
second
blow
when
the
youth
exclaimed
hold
you
loved
my
father
i
am
bujaforte
the
paladin
had
never
seen
bujaforte
but
he
saw
the
likeness
to
the
good
old
man
his
father
and
he
dropped
his
sword
o
bujaforte
said
he
i
loved
him
indeed
but
what
does
his
son
do
here
fighting
against
his
friends
bujaforte
could
not
at
once
speak
for
weeping
at
length
he
said
i
am
forced
to
be
here
by
my
lord
and
master
marsilius
and
i
have
made
a
show
of
fighting
but
have
not
hurt
a
single
christian
treachery
is
on
every
side
of
you
baldwin
himself
has
a
vest
given
him
by
marsilius
that
everybody
may
know
the
son
of
his
friend
gan
and
do
him
no
harm
put
your
helmet
on
again
said
orlando
and
behave
just
as
you
have
done
never
will
your
father
friend
be
an
enemy
to
the
son
the
hero
then
turned
in
fury
to
look
for
baldwin
who
was
hastening
towards
him
at
that
moment
with
friendliness
in
his
looks
is
strange
said
baldwin
i
have
done
my
duty
as
well
as
i
could
yet
nobody
will
come
against
me
i
have
slain
right
and
left
and
can
not
comprehend
what
it
is
that
makes
the
stoutest
infidels
avoid
me
take
off
your
vest
said
orlando
contemptuously
and
you
will
soon
discover
the
secret
if
you
wish
to
know
it
your
father
has
sold
us
to
marsilius
all
but
his
honorable
son
if
my
father
said
baldwin
impetuously
tearing
off
the
vest
has
been
such
a
villain
and
i
escape
dying
i
will
plunge
this
sword
through
his
heart
but
i
am
no
traitor
orlando
and
you
do
me
wrong
to
say
it
think
not
i
can
live
with
dishonor
baldwin
spurred
off
into
the
fight
not
waiting
to
hear
another
word
from
orlando
who
was
very
sorry
for
what
he
had
said
for
he
perceived
that
the
youth
was
in
despair
and
now
the
fight
raged
beyond
all
it
had
done
before
twenty
pagans
went
down
for
one
paladin
but
still
the
paladins
fell
sansonetto
was
beaten
to
earth
by
the
club
of
grandonio
walter
had
his
shoulder
broken
berlinghieri
and
ottone
were
slain
and
at
last
astolpho
fell
in
revenge
of
whose
death
orlando
turned
the
spot
where
he
died
into
a
lake
of
saracen
blood
the
luckless
bujaforte
met
rinaldo
and
before
he
could
explain
how
he
seemed
to
be
fighting
on
the
saracen
side
received
such
a
blow
upon
the
head
that
he
fell
unable
to
utter
a
word
orlando
cutting
his
way
to
a
spot
where
there
was
a
great
struggle
and
uproar
found
the
poor
youth
baldwin
the
son
of
gan
with
two
spears
in
his
breast
i
am
no
traitor
now
said
baldwin
and
those
were
the
last
words
he
said
orlando
was
bitterly
sorry
to
have
been
the
cause
of
his
death
and
tears
streamed
from
his
eyes
at
length
down
went
oliver
himself
he
had
become
blinded
with
his
own
blood
and
smitten
orlando
without
knowing
him
how
now
cousin
cried
orlando
have
you
too
gone
over
to
the
enemy
o
my
lord
and
master
cried
the
other
i
ask
your
pardon
i
can
see
nothing
i
am
dying
some
traitor
has
stabbed
me
in
the
back
if
you
love
me
lead
my
horse
into
the
thick
of
them
so
that
i
may
not
die
unavenged
i
shall
die
myself
before
long
said
orlando
out
of
very
toil
and
grief
so
we
will
go
together
orlando
led
his
cousin
horse
where
the
press
was
thickest
and
dreadful
was
the
strength
of
the
dying
man
and
his
tired
companion
they
made
a
street
through
which
they
passed
out
of
the
battle
and
orlando
led
his
cousin
away
to
his
tent
and
said
wait
a
little
till
i
return
for
i
will
go
and
sound
the
horn
on
the
hill
yonder
is
of
no
use
said
oliver
my
spirit
is
fast
going
and
desires
to
be
with
its
lord
and
saviour
he
would
have
said
more
but
his
words
came
from
him
imperfectly
like
those
of
a
man
in
a
dream
and
so
he
expired
when
orlando
saw
him
dead
he
felt
as
if
he
was
alone
on
the
earth
and
he
was
quite
willing
to
leave
it
only
he
wished
that
king
charles
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
should
know
how
the
case
stood
before
he
went
so
he
took
up
the
horn
and
blew
it
three
times
with
such
force
that
the
blood
burst
out
of
his
nose
and
mouth
turpin
says
that
at
the
third
blast
the
horn
broke
in
two
in
spite
of
all
the
noise
of
the
battle
the
sound
of
the
horn
broke
over
it
like
a
voice
out
of
the
other
world
they
say
that
birds
fell
dead
at
it
and
that
the
whole
saracen
army
drew
back
in
terror
charlemagne
was
sitting
in
the
midst
of
his
court
when
the
sound
reached
him
and
gan
was
there
the
emperor
was
the
first
to
hear
it
do
you
hear
that
said
he
to
his
nobles
did
you
hear
the
horn
as
i
heard
it
upon
this
they
all
listened
and
gan
felt
his
heart
misgive
him
the
horn
sounded
a
second
time
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
said
charles
orlando
is
hunting
observed
gan
and
the
stag
is
killed
but
when
the
horn
sounded
yet
a
third
time
and
the
blast
was
one
of
so
dreadful
a
vehemence
everybody
looked
at
the
other
and
then
they
all
looked
at
gan
in
a
fury
charles
rose
from
his
seat
this
is
no
hunting
of
the
stag
said
he
the
sound
goes
to
my
very
heart
o
gan
o
gan
not
for
thee
do
i
blush
but
for
myself
o
foul
and
monstrous
villain
take
him
gentleman
and
keep
him
in
close
prison
would
to
god
i
had
not
lived
to
see
this
day
but
it
was
no
time
for
words
they
put
the
traitor
in
prison
and
then
charles
with
all
his
court
took
his
way
to
roncesvalles
grieving
and
praying
it
was
afternoon
when
the
horn
sounded
and
half
an
hour
after
it
when
the
emperor
set
out
and
meantime
orlando
had
returned
to
the
fight
that
he
might
do
his
duty
however
hopeless
as
long
as
he
could
sit
his
horse
at
length
he
found
his
end
approaching
for
toil
and
fever
and
rode
all
alone
to
a
fountain
where
he
had
before
quenched
his
thirst
his
horse
was
wearier
than
he
and
no
sooner
had
his
master
alighted
than
the
beast
kneeling
down
as
if
to
take
leave
and
to
say
i
have
brought
you
to
a
place
of
rest
fell
dead
at
his
feet
orlando
cast
water
on
him
from
the
fountain
not
wishing
to
believe
him
dead
but
when
he
found
it
to
no
purpose
he
grieved
for
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
human
being
and
addressed
him
by
name
with
tears
and
asked
forgiveness
if
he
had
ever
done
him
wrong
they
say
that
the
horse
at
these
words
opened
his
eyes
a
little
and
looked
kindly
at
his
master
and
then
stirred
never
more
they
say
also
that
orlando
then
summoning
all
his
strength
smote
a
rock
near
him
with
his
beautiful
sword
durindana
thinking
to
shiver
the
steel
in
pieces
and
so
prevent
its
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
but
though
the
rock
split
like
a
slate
and
a
great
cleft
remained
ever
after
to
astonish
the
eyes
of
pilgrims
the
sword
remained
uninjured
and
now
rinaldo
and
ricciardetto
came
up
with
turpin
having
driven
back
the
saracens
and
told
orlando
that
the
battle
was
won
then
orlando
knelt
before
turpin
and
begged
remission
of
his
sins
and
turpin
gave
him
absolution
orlando
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
as
on
a
crucifix
and
embraced
it
and
he
raised
his
eyes
and
appeared
like
a
creature
seraphical
and
transfigured
and
bowing
his
head
he
breathed
out
his
pure
soul
and
now
king
charles
and
his
nobles
came
up
the
emperor
at
sight
of
the
dead
orlando
threw
himself
as
if
he
had
been
a
reckless
youth
from
his
horse
and
embraced
and
kissed
the
body
and
said
i
bless
thee
orlando
i
bless
thy
whole
life
and
all
that
thou
wast
and
all
that
thou
ever
didst
and
the
father
that
begat
thee
and
i
ask
pardon
of
thee
for
believing
those
who
brought
thee
to
thine
end
they
shall
have
their
reward
o
thou
beloved
one
but
indeed
it
is
thou
that
livest
and
i
who
am
worse
than
dead
horrible
to
the
emperor
eyes
was
the
sight
of
the
field
of
roncesvalles
the
saracens
indeed
had
fled
conquered
but
all
his
paladins
but
two
were
left
on
it
dead
and
the
whole
valley
looked
like
a
great
trampled
into
blood
and
dirt
and
reeking
to
the
heat
charles
trembled
to
his
heart
core
for
wonder
and
agony
after
gazing
dumbly
on
the
place
he
cursed
it
with
a
solemn
curse
and
wished
that
never
grass
might
grow
in
it
again
nor
seed
of
any
kind
neither
within
it
nor
on
any
of
its
mountains
around
but
the
anger
of
heaven
abide
over
it
forever
charles
and
his
warriors
went
after
the
saracens
into
spain
they
took
and
fired
saragossa
and
marsilius
was
hung
to
the
under
which
he
had
planned
his
villainy
with
gan
and
gan
was
hung
and
drawn
and
quartered
in
roncesvalles
amidst
the
execrations
of
the
country
rinaldo
and
bayard
charlemagne
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
at
the
loss
of
so
many
of
his
bravest
warriors
at
the
disaster
of
roncesvalles
and
bitterly
reproached
himself
for
his
credulity
in
resigning
himself
so
completely
to
the
counsels
of
the
treacherous
count
gan
yet
he
soon
fell
into
a
similar
snare
when
he
suffered
his
unworthy
son
charlot
to
acquire
such
an
influence
over
him
that
he
constantly
led
him
into
acts
of
cruelty
and
injustice
that
in
his
right
mind
he
would
have
scorned
to
commit
rinaldo
and
his
brothers
for
some
slight
offence
to
the
imperious
young
prince
were
forced
to
fly
from
paris
and
to
take
shelter
in
their
castle
of
montalban
for
charles
had
publicly
said
if
he
could
take
them
he
would
hang
them
all
he
sent
numbers
of
his
bravest
knights
to
arrest
them
but
all
without
success
either
rinaldo
foiled
their
efforts
and
sent
them
back
stripped
of
their
armor
and
of
their
glory
or
after
meeting
and
conferring
with
him
they
came
back
and
told
the
king
they
could
not
be
his
instruments
for
such
a
work
at
last
charles
himself
raised
a
great
army
and
went
in
person
to
compel
the
paladin
to
submit
he
ravaged
all
the
country
round
about
montalban
so
that
supplies
of
food
should
be
cut
off
and
he
threatened
death
to
any
who
should
attempt
to
issue
forth
hoping
to
compel
the
garrison
to
submit
for
want
of
food
rinaldo
resources
had
been
brought
so
low
that
it
seemed
useless
to
contend
any
longer
his
brothers
had
been
taken
prisoners
in
a
skirmish
and
his
only
hope
of
saving
their
lives
was
in
making
terms
with
the
king
so
he
sent
a
messenger
offering
to
yield
himself
and
his
castle
if
the
king
would
spare
his
and
his
brothers
lives
while
the
messenger
was
gone
rinaldo
impatient
to
learn
what
tidings
he
might
bring
rode
out
to
meet
him
when
he
had
ridden
as
far
as
he
thought
prudent
he
stopped
in
a
wood
and
alighting
tied
bayard
to
a
tree
then
he
sat
down
and
as
he
waited
he
fell
asleep
bayard
meanwhile
got
loose
and
strayed
away
where
the
grass
tempted
him
just
then
came
along
some
country
people
who
said
to
one
another
look
is
not
that
the
great
horse
bayard
that
rinaldo
rides
let
us
take
him
and
carry
him
to
king
charles
who
will
pay
us
well
for
our
trouble
they
did
so
and
the
king
was
delighted
with
his
prize
and
gave
them
a
present
that
made
them
rich
to
their
dying
day
when
rinaldo
woke
he
looked
round
for
his
horse
and
finding
him
not
he
groaned
and
said
o
unlucky
hour
that
i
was
born
how
fortune
persecutes
me
so
desperate
was
he
that
he
took
off
his
armor
and
his
spurs
saying
what
need
have
i
of
these
since
bayard
is
lost
while
he
stood
thus
lamenting
a
man
came
from
the
thicket
seemingly
bent
with
age
he
had
a
long
beard
hanging
over
his
breast
and
eyebrows
that
almost
covered
his
eyes
he
bade
rinaldo
good
day
rinaldo
thanked
him
and
said
a
good
day
i
have
hardly
had
since
i
was
born
then
said
the
old
man
signor
rinaldo
you
must
not
despair
for
god
will
make
all
things
turn
to
the
best
rinaldo
answered
my
trouble
is
too
heavy
for
me
to
hope
relief
the
king
has
taken
my
brothers
and
means
to
put
them
to
death
i
thought
to
rescue
them
by
means
of
my
horse
bayard
but
while
i
slept
some
thief
has
stolen
him
the
old
man
replied
i
will
remember
you
and
your
brothers
in
my
prayers
i
am
a
poor
man
have
you
not
something
to
give
me
rinaldo
said
i
have
nothing
to
give
but
then
he
recollected
his
spurs
he
gave
them
to
the
beggar
and
said
here
take
my
spurs
they
are
the
first
present
my
mother
gave
me
when
my
father
count
aymon
dubbed
me
knight
they
ought
to
bring
you
ten
pounds
the
old
man
took
the
spurs
and
put
them
into
his
sack
and
said
noble
sir
have
you
nothing
else
you
can
give
me
rinaldo
replied
are
you
making
sport
of
me
i
tell
you
truly
if
it
were
not
for
shame
to
beat
one
so
helpless
i
would
teach
you
better
manners
the
old
man
said
of
a
truth
sir
if
you
did
so
you
would
do
a
great
sin
if
all
had
beaten
me
of
whom
i
have
begged
i
should
have
been
killed
long
ago
for
i
ask
alms
in
churches
and
convents
and
wherever
i
can
you
say
true
replied
rinaldo
if
you
did
not
ask
none
would
relieve
you
the
old
man
said
true
noble
sir
therefore
i
pray
if
you
have
anything
more
to
spare
give
it
me
rinaldo
gave
him
his
mantle
and
said
take
it
pilgrim
i
give
it
you
for
the
love
of
christ
that
god
would
save
my
brothers
from
a
shameful
death
and
help
me
to
escape
out
of
king
charles
power
the
pilgrim
took
the
mantle
folded
it
up
and
put
it
into
his
bag
then
a
third
time
he
said
to
rinaldo
sir
have
you
nothing
left
to
give
me
that
i
may
remember
you
in
my
prayers
wretch
exclaimed
rinaldo
do
you
make
me
your
sport
and
he
drew
his
sword
and
struck
at
him
but
the
old
man
warded
off
the
blow
with
his
staff
and
said
rinaldo
would
you
slay
your
cousin
malagigi
when
rinaldo
heard
that
he
stayed
his
hand
and
gazed
doubtingly
on
the
old
man
who
now
threw
aside
his
disguise
and
appeared
to
be
indeed
malagigi
dear
cousin
said
rinaldo
pray
forgive
me
i
did
not
know
you
next
to
god
my
trust
is
in
you
help
my
brothers
to
escape
out
of
prison
i
entreat
you
i
have
lost
my
horse
and
therefore
can
not
render
them
any
assistance
malagigi
answered
cousin
rinaldo
i
will
enable
you
to
recover
your
horse
meanwhile
you
must
do
as
i
say
then
malagigi
took
from
his
sack
a
gown
and
gave
it
to
rinaldo
to
put
on
over
his
armor
and
a
hat
that
was
full
of
holes
and
an
old
pair
of
shoes
to
put
on
they
looked
like
two
pilgrims
very
old
and
poor
then
they
went
forth
from
the
wood
and
after
a
little
while
saw
four
monks
riding
along
the
road
malagigi
said
to
rinaldo
i
will
go
meet
the
monks
and
see
what
news
i
can
learn
malagigi
learned
from
the
monks
that
on
the
approaching
festival
there
would
be
a
great
crowd
of
people
at
court
for
the
prince
was
going
to
show
the
ladies
the
famous
horse
bayard
that
used
to
belong
to
rinaldo
what
said
the
pilgrim
is
bayard
there
yes
answered
the
monks
the
king
has
given
him
to
charlot
and
after
the
prince
has
ridden
him
the
king
means
to
pass
sentence
on
the
brothers
of
rinaldo
and
have
them
hanged
then
malagigi
asked
alms
of
the
monks
but
they
would
give
him
none
till
he
threw
aside
his
pilgrim
garb
and
let
them
see
his
armor
when
partly
for
charity
and
partly
for
terror
they
gave
him
a
golden
cup
adorned
with
precious
stones
that
sparkled
in
the
sunshine
malagigi
then
hastened
back
to
rinaldo
and
told
him
what
he
had
learned
the
morning
of
the
rinaldo
and
malagigi
came
to
the
place
where
the
sports
were
to
be
held
malagigi
gave
rinaldo
his
spurs
back
again
and
said
cousin
put
on
your
spurs
for
you
will
need
them
how
shall
i
need
them
said
rinaldo
since
i
have
lost
my
horse
yet
he
did
as
malagigi
directed
him
when
the
two
had
taken
their
stand
on
the
border
of
the
field
among
the
crowd
the
princes
and
ladies
of
the
court
began
to
assemble
when
they
were
all
assembled
the
king
came
also
and
charlot
with
him
near
whom
the
horse
bayard
was
led
in
the
charge
of
grooms
who
were
expressly
enjoined
to
guard
him
safely
the
king
looking
round
on
the
circle
of
spectators
saw
malagigi
and
rinaldo
and
observed
the
splendid
cup
that
they
had
and
said
to
charlot
see
my
son
what
a
brilliant
cup
those
two
pilgrims
have
got
it
seems
to
be
worth
a
hundred
ducats
that
is
true
said
charlot
let
us
go
and
ask
where
they
got
it
so
they
rode
to
the
place
where
the
pilgrims
stood
and
charlot
stopped
bayard
close
to
them
the
horse
snuffed
at
the
pilgrims
knew
rinaldo
and
caressed
his
master
the
king
said
to
malagigi
friend
where
did
you
get
that
beautiful
cup
malagigi
replied
honorable
sir
i
paid
for
it
all
the
money
i
have
saved
from
eleven
years
begging
in
churches
and
convents
the
pope
himself
has
blessed
it
and
given
it
the
power
that
whosoever
eats
or
drinks
out
of
it
shall
be
pardoned
of
all
his
sins
then
said
the
king
to
charlot
my
son
these
are
right
holy
men
see
how
the
dumb
beast
worships
them
then
the
king
said
to
malagigi
give
me
a
morsel
from
your
cup
that
i
may
be
cleared
of
my
sins
malagigi
answered
illustrious
lord
i
dare
not
do
it
unless
you
will
forgive
all
who
have
at
any
time
offended
you
you
know
that
christ
forgave
all
those
who
had
betrayed
and
crucified
him
the
king
replied
friend
that
is
true
but
rinaldo
has
so
grievously
offended
me
that
i
can
not
forgive
him
nor
that
other
man
malagigi
the
magician
these
two
shall
never
live
in
my
kingdom
again
if
i
catch
them
i
will
certainly
have
them
hanged
but
tell
me
pilgrim
who
is
that
man
who
stands
beside
you
he
is
deaf
dumb
and
blind
said
malagigi
then
the
king
said
again
give
me
to
drink
of
your
cup
to
take
away
my
sins
malagigi
answered
my
lord
king
here
is
my
poor
brother
who
for
fifty
days
has
not
heard
spoken
nor
seen
this
misfortune
befell
him
in
a
house
where
we
found
shelter
and
the
day
before
yesterday
we
met
with
a
wise
woman
who
told
him
the
only
hope
of
a
cure
for
him
was
to
come
to
some
place
where
bayard
was
to
be
ridden
and
to
mount
and
ride
him
that
would
do
him
more
good
than
anything
else
then
said
the
king
friend
you
have
come
to
the
right
place
for
bayard
is
to
be
ridden
here
give
me
a
draught
from
your
cup
and
your
companion
shall
ride
upon
bayard
malagigi
hearing
these
words
said
be
it
so
then
the
king
with
great
devotion
took
a
spoon
and
dipped
a
portion
from
the
pilgrim
cup
believing
that
his
sins
should
be
thereby
forgiven
when
this
was
done
the
king
said
to
charlot
son
i
request
that
you
will
let
this
sick
pilgrim
sit
on
your
horse
and
ride
if
he
can
for
by
so
doing
he
will
be
healed
of
all
his
infirmities
charlot
replied
that
will
i
gladly
do
so
saying
he
dismounted
and
the
servants
took
the
pilgrim
in
their
arms
and
helped
him
on
the
horse
wher
rinaldo
was
mounted
he
put
his
feet
in
the
stirrups
and
said
i
would
like
to
ride
a
little
malagigi
hearing
him
speak
seemed
delighted
and
asked
him
whether
he
could
see
and
hear
also
yes
said
rinaldo
i
am
healed
of
all
my
infirmities
when
the
king
heard
it
he
said
to
bishop
turpin
my
lord
bishop
we
must
celebrate
this
with
a
procession
with
crosses
and
banners
for
it
is
a
great
miracle
when
rinaldo
remarked
that
he
was
not
carefully
watched
he
spoke
to
the
horse
and
touched
him
with
the
spurs
bayard
knew
that
his
master
was
upon
him
and
he
started
off
upon
a
rapid
pace
and
in
a
few
moments
was
a
good
way
off
malagigi
pretended
to
be
in
great
alarm
o
noble
king
and
master
he
cried
my
poor
companion
is
run
away
with
he
will
fall
and
break
his
neck
the
king
ordered
his
knights
to
ride
after
the
pilgrim
and
bring
him
back
or
help
him
if
need
were
they
did
so
but
it
was
in
vain
rinaldo
left
them
all
behind
him
and
kept
on
his
way
till
he
reached
montalban
malagigi
was
suffered
to
depart
unsuspected
and
he
went
his
way
making
sad
lamentation
for
the
fate
of
his
comrade
who
he
pretended
to
think
must
surely
be
dashed
to
pieces
malagigi
did
not
go
far
but
having
changed
his
disguise
returned
to
where
the
king
was
and
employed
his
best
art
in
getting
the
brothers
of
rinaldo
out
of
prison
he
succeeded
and
all
three
got
safely
to
montalban
where
rinaldo
joy
at
the
rescue
of
his
brothers
and
the
recovery
of
bayard
was
more
than
tongue
can
tell
death
of
rinaldo
the
distress
in
rinaldo
castle
for
want
of
food
grew
more
severe
every
day
under
the
pressure
of
the
siege
the
garrison
were
forced
to
kill
their
horses
both
to
save
the
provision
they
would
consume
and
to
make
food
of
their
flesh
at
last
all
the
horses
were
killed
except
bayard
and
rinaldo
said
to
his
brothers
bayard
must
die
for
we
have
nothing
else
to
eat
so
they
went
to
the
stable
and
brought
out
bayard
to
kill
him
but
alardo
said
brother
let
bayard
live
a
little
longer
who
knows
what
god
may
do
for
us
bayard
heard
these
words
and
understood
them
as
if
he
was
a
man
and
fell
on
his
knees
as
if
he
would
beg
for
mercy
when
rinaldo
saw
the
distress
of
his
horse
his
heart
failed
him
and
he
let
him
live
just
at
this
time
aya
rinaldo
mother
who
was
the
sister
of
the
emperor
came
to
the
camp
attended
by
knights
and
ladies
to
intercede
for
her
sons
she
fell
on
her
knees
before
the
king
and
besought
him
that
he
would
pardon
rinaldo
and
his
brothers
and
all
the
peers
and
knights
took
her
side
and
entreated
the
king
to
grant
her
prayer
then
said
the
king
dear
sister
you
act
the
part
of
a
good
mother
and
i
respect
your
tender
heart
and
yield
to
your
entreaties
i
will
spare
your
sons
their
lives
if
they
submit
implicitly
to
my
will
when
charlot
heard
this
he
approached
the
king
and
whispered
in
his
ear
and
the
king
turned
to
his
sister
and
said
charlot
must
have
bayard
because
i
have
given
the
horse
to
him
now
go
my
sister
and
tell
rinaldo
what
i
have
said
when
the
lady
aya
heard
these
words
she
was
delighted
thanked
god
in
her
heart
and
said
worthy
king
and
brother
i
will
do
as
you
bid
me
so
she
went
into
the
castle
where
her
sons
received
her
most
joyfully
and
affectionately
and
she
told
them
the
king
offer
then
alardo
said
brother
i
would
rather
have
the
king
enmity
than
give
bayard
to
charlot
for
i
believe
he
will
kill
him
likewise
said
all
the
brothers
when
rinaldo
heard
them
he
said
dear
brothers
if
we
may
win
our
forgiveness
by
giving
up
the
horse
so
be
it
let
us
make
our
peace
for
we
can
not
stand
against
the
king
power
then
he
went
to
his
mother
and
told
her
they
would
give
the
horse
to
charlot
and
more
too
if
the
king
would
pardon
them
and
forgive
all
that
they
had
done
against
his
crown
and
dignity
the
lady
returned
to
charles
and
told
him
the
answer
of
her
sons
when
the
peace
was
thus
made
between
the
king
and
the
sons
of
aymon
the
brothers
came
forth
from
the
castle
bringing
bayard
with
them
and
falling
at
the
king
feet
begged
his
forgiveness
the
king
bade
them
rise
and
received
them
into
favor
in
the
sight
of
all
his
noble
knights
and
counsellors
to
the
great
joy
of
all
especially
of
the
lady
aya
their
mother
then
rinaldo
took
the
horse
bayard
gave
him
to
charlot
and
said
my
lord
and
prince
this
horse
i
give
to
you
do
with
him
as
to
you
seems
good
charlot
took
him
as
had
been
agreed
on
then
he
made
the
servants
take
him
to
the
bridge
and
throw
him
into
the
water
bayard
sank
to
the
bottom
but
soon
came
to
the
surface
again
and
swam
saw
rinaldo
looking
at
him
came
to
land
ran
to
his
old
master
and
stood
by
him
as
proudly
as
if
he
had
understanding
and
would
say
why
did
you
treat
me
so
when
the
prince
saw
that
he
said
rinaldo
give
me
the
horse
again
for
he
must
die
rinaldo
replied
my
lord
and
prince
he
is
yours
without
dispute
and
gave
him
to
him
the
prince
then
had
a
millstone
tied
to
each
foot
and
two
to
his
neck
and
made
them
throw
him
again
into
the
water
bayard
struggled
in
the
water
looked
up
to
his
master
threw
off
the
stones
and
came
back
to
rinaldo
when
alardo
saw
that
he
said
now
must
thou
be
disgraced
forever
brother
if
thou
give
up
the
horse
again
but
rinaldo
answered
brother
be
still
shall
i
for
the
horse
life
provoke
the
anger
of
the
king
again
then
alardo
said
ah
bayard
what
a
return
do
we
make
for
all
thy
true
love
and
service
rinaldo
gave
the
horse
to
the
prince
again
and
said
my
lord
if
the
horse
comes
out
again
i
can
not
return
him
to
you
any
more
for
it
wrings
my
heart
too
much
then
charlot
had
bayard
loaded
with
the
stones
as
before
and
thrown
into
the
water
and
commanded
rinaldo
that
he
should
not
stand
where
the
horse
would
see
him
when
bayard
rose
to
the
surface
he
stretched
his
neck
out
of
the
water
and
looked
round
for
his
master
but
saw
him
not
then
he
sunk
to
the
bottom
rinaldo
was
so
distressed
for
the
loss
of
bayard
that
he
made
a
vow
to
ride
no
horse
again
all
his
life
long
nor
to
bind
a
sword
to
his
side
but
to
become
a
hermit
he
resolved
to
betake
himself
to
some
wild
wood
but
first
to
return
to
his
castle
to
see
his
children
and
to
appoint
to
each
his
share
of
his
estate
so
he
took
leave
of
the
king
and
of
his
brothers
and
returned
to
montalban
and
his
brothers
remained
with
the
king
rinaldo
called
his
children
to
him
and
he
made
his
eldest
born
aymeric
a
knight
and
made
him
lord
of
his
castle
and
of
his
land
he
gave
to
the
rest
what
other
goods
he
had
and
kissed
and
embraced
them
all
commended
them
to
god
and
then
departed
from
them
with
a
heavy
heart
he
had
not
travelled
far
when
he
entered
a
wood
and
there
met
with
a
hermit
who
had
long
been
retired
from
the
world
rinaldo
greeted
him
and
the
hermit
replied
courteously
and
asked
him
who
he
was
and
what
was
his
purpose
rinaldo
replied
sir
i
have
led
a
sinful
life
many
deeds
of
violence
have
i
done
and
many
men
have
i
slain
not
always
in
a
good
cause
but
often
under
the
impulse
of
my
own
headstrong
passions
i
have
also
been
the
cause
of
the
death
of
many
of
my
friends
who
took
my
part
not
because
they
thought
me
in
the
right
but
only
for
love
of
me
and
now
i
come
to
make
confession
of
all
my
sins
and
to
do
penance
for
the
rest
of
my
life
if
perhaps
the
mercy
of
god
will
forgive
me
the
hermit
said
friend
i
perceive
you
have
fallen
into
great
sins
and
have
broken
the
commandments
of
god
but
his
mercy
is
greater
than
your
sins
and
if
you
repent
from
your
heart
and
lead
a
new
life
there
is
yet
hope
for
you
that
he
will
forgive
you
what
is
past
so
rinaldo
was
comforted
and
said
master
i
will
stay
with
you
and
what
you
bid
ane
i
will
do
the
hermit
replied
roots
and
vegetables
will
be
your
food
shirt
or
shoes
you
may
not
wear
your
lot
must
be
poverty
and
want
if
you
stay
with
me
rinaldo
replied
i
will
cheerfully
bear
all
this
and
more
so
he
remained
three
whole
years
with
the
hermit
and
after
that
his
strength
failed
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
like
to
die
one
night
the
hermit
had
a
dream
and
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
which
commanded
him
to
say
to
his
companion
that
he
must
without
delay
go
to
the
holy
land
and
fight
against
the
heathen
the
hermit
when
he
heard
that
voice
was
glad
and
calling
rinaldo
he
said
friend
angel
has
commanded
me
to
say
to
you
that
you
must
without
delay
go
to
jerusalem
and
help
our
in
their
struggle
with
the
infidels
then
said
rinaldo
ah
master
how
can
i
do
that
it
is
over
three
years
since
i
made
a
vow
no
more
to
ride
a
horse
nor
take
a
sword
or
spear
in
my
hand
the
hermit
answered
dear
friend
obey
god
and
do
what
the
angel
commanded
i
will
do
so
said
rinaldo
and
pray
for
me
my
master
that
god
may
guide
me
right
then
he
departed
and
went
to
the
seaside
and
took
ship
and
came
to
tripoli
in
syria
and
as
he
went
on
his
way
his
strength
returned
to
him
till
it
was
equal
to
what
it
was
in
his
best
days
and
though
he
never
mounted
a
horse
nor
took
a
sword
in
his
hand
yet
with
his
pilgrim
staff
he
did
good
service
in
the
armies
of
the
christians
and
it
pleased
god
that
he
escaped
unhurt
though
he
was
present
in
many
battles
and
his
courage
inspired
the
men
with
the
same
at
last
a
truce
was
made
with
the
saracens
and
rinaldo
now
old
and
infirm
wishing
to
see
his
native
land
again
before
he
died
took
ship
and
sailed
for
france
when
he
arrived
he
shunned
to
go
to
the
resorts
of
the
great
and
preferred
to
live
among
the
humble
folk
where
he
was
unknown
he
did
country
work
and
lived
on
milk
and
bread
drank
water
and
was
therewith
content
while
he
so
lived
he
heard
that
the
city
of
cologne
was
the
holiest
and
best
of
cities
on
account
of
the
relics
and
bodies
of
saints
who
had
there
poured
out
their
blood
for
the
faith
this
induced
him
to
betake
himself
thither
when
the
pious
hero
arrived
at
cologne
he
went
to
the
monastery
of
peter
and
lived
a
holy
life
occupied
night
and
day
in
devotion
it
so
happened
that
at
that
time
in
the
next
town
to
cologne
there
raged
a
dreadful
pestilence
many
people
came
to
rinaldo
to
beg
him
to
pray
for
them
that
the
plague
might
be
stayed
the
holy
man
prayed
fervently
and
besought
the
lord
to
take
away
the
plague
from
the
people
and
his
prayer
was
heard
the
stroke
of
the
pestilence
was
arrested
and
all
the
people
thanked
the
holy
man
and
praised
god
now
there
was
at
this
time
at
cologne
a
bishop
called
agilolphus
who
was
a
wise
and
understanding
man
who
led
a
pure
and
secluded
life
and
set
a
good
example
to
others
this
bishop
undertook
to
build
the
church
of
peter
and
gave
notice
to
all
stonemasons
and
other
workmen
round
about
to
come
to
cologne
where
they
should
find
work
and
wages
among
others
came
rinaldo
and
he
worked
among
the
laborers
and
did
more
than
four
or
five
common
workmen
when
they
went
to
dinner
he
brought
stone
and
mortar
so
that
they
had
enough
for
the
whole
day
when
the
others
went
to
bed
he
stretched
himself
out
on
the
stones
he
ate
bread
only
and
drank
nothing
but
water
and
had
for
his
wages
but
a
penny
a
day
the
head
workman
asked
him
his
name
and
where
he
belonged
he
would
not
tell
but
said
nothing
and
pursued
his
work
they
called
him
peter
workman
because
he
was
so
devoted
to
his
work
when
the
overseer
saw
the
diligence
of
this
holy
man
he
chid
the
laziness
of
the
other
workmen
and
said
you
receive
more
pay
than
this
good
man
but
do
not
do
half
as
much
work
for
this
reason
the
other
workmen
hated
rinaldo
and
made
a
secret
agreement
to
kill
him
they
knew
that
he
made
it
a
practice
to
go
every
night
to
a
certain
church
to
pray
and
give
alms
so
they
agreed
to
lay
wait
for
him
with
the
purpose
to
kill
him
when
he
came
to
the
spot
they
seized
him
and
beat
him
over
the
head
till
he
was
dead
then
they
put
his
body
into
a
sack
and
stones
with
it
and
cast
it
into
the
rhine
in
the
hope
the
sack
would
sink
to
the
bottom
and
be
there
concealed
but
god
willed
not
that
it
should
be
so
but
caused
the
sack
to
float
on
the
surface
and
be
thrown
upon
the
bank
and
the
soul
of
the
holy
martyr
was
carried
by
angels
with
songs
of
praise
up
to
the
heavens
now
at
that
time
the
people
of
dortmund
had
become
converted
to
the
christian
faith
and
they
sent
to
the
bishop
of
cologne
and
desired
him
to
give
them
some
of
the
holy
relics
that
are
in
such
abundance
in
that
city
so
the
bishop
called
together
his
clergy
to
deliberate
what
answer
they
should
give
to
this
request
and
it
was
determined
to
give
to
the
people
of
dortmund
the
body
of
the
holy
man
who
had
just
suffered
martyrdom
when
now
the
body
with
the
coffin
was
put
on
the
cart
the
cart
began
to
move
toward
dortmund
without
horses
or
help
of
men
and
stopped
not
till
it
reached
the
place
where
the
church
of
rinaldo
now
stands
the
bishop
and
his
clergy
followed
the
holy
man
to
do
him
honor
with
singing
of
hymns
for
a
space
of
three
miles
and
rinaldo
has
ever
since
been
the
patron
of
that
place
and
many
wonderful
works
has
god
done
through
him
as
may
be
seen
in
the
legends
huon
of
bordeaux
when
charlemagne
grew
old
he
felt
the
burden
of
government
become
heavier
year
by
year
till
at
last
he
called
together
his
high
barons
and
peers
to
propose
to
abdicate
the
empire
and
the
throne
of
france
in
favor
of
his
sons
charlot
and
lewis
the
emperor
was
unreasonably
partial
to
his
eldest
son
he
would
have
been
glad
to
have
had
the
barons
and
peers
demand
charlot
for
their
only
sovereign
but
that
prince
was
so
infamous
for
his
falsehood
and
cruelty
that
the
council
strenuously
opposed
the
emperor
proposal
of
abdicating
and
implored
him
to
continue
to
hold
a
sceptre
which
he
wielded
with
so
much
glory
amaury
of
hauteville
cousin
of
ganelon
and
now
head
of
the
wicked
branch
of
the
house
of
maganza
was
the
secret
partisan
of
charlot
whom
he
resembled
in
his
loose
morals
and
bad
dispositions
amaury
nourished
the
most
bitter
resentment
against
the
house
of
guienne
of
which
the
former
duke
sevinus
had
often
rebuked
his
misdeeds
he
took
advantage
of
this
occasion
to
do
an
injury
to
the
two
young
children
whom
the
duke
sevinus
had
left
under
the
charge
of
the
duchess
alice
their
mother
and
at
the
same
time
to
advance
his
interest
with
charlot
by
increasing
his
wealth
and
power
with
this
view
he
suggested
to
the
prince
a
new
idea
he
pretended
to
agree
with
the
opinion
of
the
barons
he
said
that
it
would
be
best
to
try
charlot
capacity
for
government
by
giving
him
some
rich
provinces
before
placing
him
upon
the
throne
and
that
the
emperor
without
depriving
himself
of
any
part
of
his
realm
might
give
charlot
the
investiture
of
guienne
for
although
seven
years
had
passed
since
the
death
of
sevinus
the
young
duke
his
son
had
not
yet
repaired
to
the
court
of
charlemagne
to
render
the
homage
due
to
his
lawful
sovereign
we
have
often
had
occasion
to
admire
the
justice
and
wisdom
of
the
advice
which
on
all
occasions
the
duke
namo
of
bavaria
gave
to
charlemagne
and
he
now
discountenanced
with
indignation
the
selfish
advice
of
amaury
he
represented
to
the
emperor
the
early
age
of
the
children
of
sevinus
and
the
useful
and
glorious
services
of
their
late
father
and
proposed
to
charlemagne
to
send
two
knights
to
the
duchess
at
bordeaux
to
summon
her
two
sons
to
the
court
of
the
emperor
to
pay
their
respects
and
render
homage
charlemagne
approved
this
advice
and
sent
two
chevaliers
to
demand
the
two
young
princes
of
their
mother
no
sooner
had
the
duchess
learned
the
approach
of
the
two
knights
than
she
sent
distinguished
persons
to
receive
them
and
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
palace
she
presented
herself
before
them
with
her
elder
and
younger
sons
huon
and
girard
the
deputies
delighted
with
the
honors
and
caresses
they
received
accompanied
with
rich
presents
left
bordeaux
with
regret
and
on
their
return
represented
to
charlemagne
that
the
young
duke
huon
seemed
born
to
tread
in
the
footsteps
of
his
brave
father
informing
him
that
in
three
months
the
young
princes
of
guienne
would
present
themselves
at
his
court
the
duchess
employed
the
short
interval
in
giving
her
sons
her
last
instructions
huon
received
them
in
his
heart
and
girard
gave
as
much
heed
to
them
as
could
be
expected
from
one
so
young
the
preparations
for
their
departure
having
been
made
the
duchess
embraced
them
tenderly
commending
them
to
the
care
of
heaven
and
charged
them
to
call
on
their
way
at
the
celebrated
monastery
of
cluny
to
visit
the
abbot
the
brother
of
their
father
this
abbot
worthy
of
his
high
dignity
had
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
doing
good
setting
an
example
of
every
excellence
and
making
virtue
attractive
by
his
example
he
received
his
nephews
with
the
greatest
magnificence
and
aware
how
useful
his
presence
might
be
to
them
with
charlemagne
whose
valued
counsellor
he
was
he
took
with
them
the
road
to
paris
when
amaury
learned
what
reception
the
two
deputies
of
charlemagne
had
received
at
bordeaux
and
the
arrangements
made
for
the
visit
of
the
young
princes
to
the
emperor
court
he
suggested
to
charlot
to
give
him
a
troop
of
his
guards
with
which
he
proposed
to
lay
wait
for
the
young
men
in
the
wood
of
montlery
put
them
to
death
and
thereby
give
the
prince
charlot
possession
of
the
duchy
of
guienne
a
plan
of
treachery
and
violence
agreed
but
too
well
with
disposition
he
not
only
adopted
the
suggestion
of
amaury
but
insisted
upon
taking
a
part
in
it
they
went
out
secretly
by
night
followed
by
a
great
number
of
attendants
all
armed
in
black
to
lie
in
ambuscade
in
the
wood
where
the
brothers
were
to
pass
girard
the
younger
of
the
two
having
amused
himself
as
he
rode
by
flying
his
hawk
at
such
game
as
presented
itself
had
ridden
in
advance
of
his
brother
and
the
abbot
of
cluny
charlot
who
saw
him
coming
alone
and
unarmed
went
forth
to
meet
him
sought
a
quarrel
with
him
and
threw
him
from
his
horse
with
a
stroke
of
his
lance
girard
uttered
a
cry
as
he
fell
huon
heard
it
and
flew
to
his
defence
with
no
other
weapon
than
his
sword
he
came
up
with
him
and
saw
the
blood
flowing
from
his
wound
what
has
this
child
done
to
you
wretch
he
exclaimed
to
charlot
how
cowardly
to
attack
him
when
unprepared
to
defend
himself
by
my
faith
said
charlot
i
mean
to
do
the
same
by
you
know
that
i
am
the
son
of
duke
thierry
of
ardennes
from
whom
your
father
sevinus
took
three
castles
i
have
sworn
to
avenge
him
and
i
defy
you
coward
answered
huon
i
know
well
the
baseness
that
dwells
in
your
race
worthy
son
of
thierry
use
the
advantage
that
your
armor
gives
you
but
know
that
i
fear
you
not
at
these
words
charlot
had
the
wickedness
to
put
his
lance
in
rest
and
to
run
upon
huon
who
had
barely
time
to
wrap
his
arm
in
his
mantle
with
this
feeble
buckler
he
received
the
thrust
of
the
lance
it
penetrated
the
mantle
but
missed
his
body
then
rising
upon
his
stirrups
sir
huon
struck
charlot
so
terrible
a
blow
with
his
sword
that
the
helmet
was
cleft
asunder
and
his
head
too
the
dastardly
prince
fell
dead
upon
the
ground
huon
now
perceived
that
the
wood
was
full
of
armed
men
he
called
the
men
of
his
suite
and
they
hastily
put
themselves
in
order
but
nobody
issued
from
the
wood
to
attack
him
amaury
who
saw
charlot
fall
had
no
desire
to
compromit
himself
and
feeling
sure
that
charlemagne
would
avenge
the
death
of
his
son
he
saw
no
occasion
for
his
doing
anything
more
at
present
he
left
huon
and
the
abbot
of
cluny
to
bind
up
the
wound
of
girard
and
having
seen
them
depart
and
resume
their
way
to
paris
he
took
up
the
body
of
charlot
and
placing
it
across
a
horse
had
it
carried
to
paris
where
he
arrived
four
hours
after
huon
the
abbot
of
cluny
presented
his
nephew
to
charlemagne
but
huon
refrained
from
paying
his
obeisance
complaining
grievously
of
the
ambush
which
had
been
set
for
him
which
he
said
could
not
have
been
without
the
emperor
permission
charlemagne
surprised
at
a
charge
which
his
magnanimous
soul
was
incapable
of
meriting
asked
eagerly
of
the
abbot
what
were
the
grounds
of
the
complaints
of
his
nephew
the
abbot
told
him
faithfully
all
that
had
happened
informing
him
that
a
coward
knight
who
called
himself
the
son
of
thierry
of
ardennes
had
wounded
girard
and
run
upon
huon
who
was
unarmed
but
by
his
force
and
valor
he
had
overcome
the
traitor
and
left
him
dead
upon
the
plain
charlemagne
indignantly
disavowed
any
connection
with
the
action
of
the
infamous
thierry
congratulated
the
young
duke
upon
his
victory
himself
conducted
the
two
brothers
to
a
rich
apartment
stayed
to
see
the
first
dressing
applied
to
the
wound
of
girard
and
left
the
brothers
in
charge
of
duke
namo
of
bavaria
who
having
been
a
companion
in
arms
of
the
duke
sevinus
regarded
the
young
men
almost
as
if
they
were
his
own
sons
charlemagne
had
hardly
quitted
them
when
returning
to
his
chamber
he
heard
cries
and
saw
through
the
window
a
party
of
armed
men
just
arrived
he
recognized
amaury
who
bore
a
dead
knight
stretched
across
a
horse
and
the
name
of
charlot
was
heard
among
the
exclamations
of
the
people
assembled
in
the
charles
partiality
for
this
unworthy
son
was
one
of
his
weaknesses
he
descended
in
trepidation
to
the
ran
to
amaury
and
uttered
a
cry
of
grief
on
recognizing
charlot
it
is
huon
of
bordeaux
said
the
traitor
amaury
who
has
massacred
your
son
before
it
was
in
my
power
to
defend
him
charlemagne
furious
at
these
words
seized
a
sword
and
flew
to
the
apartment
of
the
two
brothers
to
plunge
it
into
the
heart
of
the
murderer
of
his
son
duke
namo
stopped
his
hand
for
an
instant
while
charles
told
him
the
crime
of
which
huon
was
accused
he
is
a
peer
of
the
realm
said
namo
and
if
he
is
guilty
is
he
not
here
in
your
power
and
are
not
we
peers
the
proper
judges
to
condemn
him
to
death
let
not
your
hand
be
stained
with
his
blood
the
emperor
calmed
by
the
wisdom
of
duke
namo
summoned
amaury
to
his
presence
the
peers
assembled
to
hear
his
testimony
and
the
traitor
accused
huon
of
bordeaux
of
having
struck
the
fatal
blow
without
allowing
charlot
an
opportunity
to
defend
himself
and
though
he
knew
that
his
opponent
was
the
emperor
eldest
son
the
abbot
of
cluny
indignant
at
the
false
accusation
of
amaury
advanced
and
said
by
saint
benedict
sire
the
traitor
lies
in
his
throat
if
my
nephew
has
slain
charlot
it
was
in
his
own
defence
and
after
having
seen
his
brother
wounded
by
him
and
also
in
ignorance
that
his
adversary
was
the
prince
though
i
am
a
son
of
the
church
added
the
good
abbot
i
forget
not
that
i
am
a
knight
by
birth
i
offer
to
prove
with
my
body
the
lie
upon
amaury
if
he
dares
sustain
it
and
i
shall
feel
that
i
am
doing
a
better
work
to
punish
a
disloyal
traitor
than
to
sing
lauds
and
matins
huon
to
this
time
had
kept
silent
amazed
at
the
black
calumny
of
amaury
but
now
he
stepped
forth
and
addressing
amaury
said
traitor
darest
thou
maintain
in
arms
the
lie
thou
hast
uttered
amaury
a
knight
of
great
prowess
despising
the
youth
and
slight
figure
of
huon
hesitated
not
to
offer
his
glove
which
huon
seized
then
turning
again
to
the
peers
he
said
i
pray
you
let
the
combat
be
allowed
me
for
never
was
there
a
more
legitimate
cause
the
duke
namo
and
the
rest
deciding
that
the
question
should
be
remitted
to
the
judgment
of
heaven
the
combat
was
ordained
to
which
charlemagne
unwillingly
consented
the
young
duke
was
restored
to
the
charge
of
duke
namo
who
the
next
morning
invested
him
with
the
honors
of
knighthood
and
gave
him
armor
of
proof
with
a
white
shield
the
abbot
of
cluny
delighted
to
find
in
his
nephew
sentiments
worthy
of
his
birth
embraced
him
gave
him
his
blessing
and
hastened
to
the
church
of
germains
to
pray
for
him
while
the
officers
of
the
king
prepared
the
lists
for
the
combat
the
battle
was
long
and
obstinate
the
address
and
agility
of
huon
enabled
him
to
avoid
the
terrible
blows
which
the
ferocious
amaury
aimed
at
him
but
huon
had
more
than
once
drawn
blood
from
his
antagonist
the
effect
began
to
be
perceived
in
the
failing
strength
of
the
traitor
at
last
he
threw
himself
from
his
horse
and
kneeling
begged
for
mercy
spare
me
he
said
and
i
will
confess
all
aid
me
to
rise
and
lead
me
to
charlemagne
the
brave
and
loyal
huon
at
these
words
put
his
sword
under
his
left
arm
and
stretched
out
his
right
to
raise
the
prostrate
man
who
seized
the
opportunity
to
give
him
a
thrust
in
the
side
the
hauberk
of
huon
resisted
the
blow
and
he
was
wounded
but
slightly
transported
with
rage
at
this
act
of
baseness
he
forgot
how
necessary
for
his
complete
acquittal
the
confession
of
amaury
was
and
without
delay
dealt
him
the
fatal
blow
duke
namo
and
the
other
peers
approached
had
the
body
of
amaury
dragged
forth
from
the
lists
and
conducted
huon
to
charlemagne
the
emperor
however
listening
to
nothing
but
his
resentment
and
grief
for
the
death
of
his
son
refused
to
be
satisfied
and
under
the
plea
that
huon
had
not
succeeded
in
making
his
accuser
retract
his
charge
seemed
resolved
to
confiscate
his
estates
and
to
banish
him
forever
from
france
it
was
not
till
after
long
entreaties
on
the
part
of
duke
namo
and
the
rest
that
he
consented
to
grant
huon
his
pardon
under
conditions
which
he
should
impose
huon
approached
and
knelt
before
the
emperor
rendered
his
homage
and
cried
him
mercy
for
the
involuntary
killing
of
his
son
charlemagne
would
not
receive
the
hands
of
huon
in
his
own
but
touched
him
with
his
sceptre
saying
i
receive
thy
homage
and
pardon
thee
the
death
of
my
son
but
only
on
one
condition
you
shall
go
immediately
to
the
court
of
the
sultan
gaudisso
you
shall
present
yourself
before
him
as
he
sits
at
meat
you
shall
cut
off
the
head
of
the
most
illustrious
guest
whom
you
shall
find
sitting
nearest
to
him
you
shall
kiss
three
times
on
the
mouth
the
fair
princess
his
daughter
and
you
shall
demand
of
the
sultan
as
token
of
tribute
to
me
a
handful
of
the
white
hair
of
his
beard
and
four
grinders
from
his
mouth
these
conditions
caused
a
murmur
from
all
the
assembly
what
said
the
abbot
of
cluny
slaughter
a
saracen
prince
without
first
offering
him
baptism
the
second
condition
is
not
so
hard
said
the
young
peers
but
the
demand
that
huon
is
bound
to
make
of
the
old
sultan
is
very
uncivil
and
will
be
hard
to
obtain
the
emperor
obstinacy
when
he
had
once
resolved
upon
a
thing
is
well
known
to
the
courage
of
huon
nothing
seemed
impossible
i
accept
the
conditions
said
he
silencing
the
intercessions
of
the
old
duke
of
bavaria
my
liege
i
accept
my
pardon
at
this
price
i
go
to
execute
your
commands
as
your
vassal
and
a
peer
of
france
the
duke
namo
and
abbot
of
cluny
being
unable
to
obtain
any
relaxation
of
the
sentence
passed
by
charlemagne
led
forth
the
young
duke
who
determined
to
set
out
at
once
on
his
expedition
all
that
the
good
abbot
could
obtain
of
him
was
that
he
should
prepare
for
this
perilous
undertaking
by
going
first
to
rome
to
pay
his
homage
to
the
pope
who
was
the
brother
of
the
duchess
alice
huon
mother
and
from
him
demand
absolution
and
his
blessing
huon
promised
it
and
forthwith
set
out
on
his
way
to
rome
huon
of
bordeaux
continued
huon
having
traversed
the
apennines
and
italy
arrived
at
the
environs
of
rome
where
laying
aside
his
armor
he
assumed
the
dress
of
a
pilgrim
in
this
attire
he
presented
himself
before
the
pope
and
not
till
after
he
had
made
a
full
confession
of
his
sins
did
he
announce
himself
as
his
nephew
ah
my
dear
nephew
exclaimed
the
holy
father
what
harder
penance
could
i
impose
than
the
emperor
has
already
done
go
in
peace
my
son
he
added
absolving
him
i
go
to
intercede
for
you
with
the
most
high
then
he
led
his
nephew
into
his
palace
and
introduced
him
to
all
the
cardinals
and
princes
of
rome
as
the
duke
of
guienne
son
of
the
duchess
alice
his
sister
huon
at
setting
out
had
made
a
vow
not
to
stop
more
than
three
days
in
a
place
the
holy
father
took
advantage
of
this
time
to
inspire
him
with
zeal
for
the
glory
of
christianity
and
with
confidence
in
the
protection
of
the
most
high
he
advised
him
to
embark
for
palestine
to
visit
the
holy
sepulchre
and
to
depart
thence
for
the
interior
of
asia
loaded
with
the
blessings
of
the
holy
father
huon
obeying
his
counsels
embarked
for
palestine
arrived
and
visited
with
the
greatest
reverence
the
holy
places
he
then
departed
and
took
his
way
toward
the
east
but
ignorant
of
the
country
and
of
the
language
he
lost
himself
in
a
forest
and
remained
three
days
without
seeing
a
human
creature
living
on
honey
and
wild
fruits
which
he
found
on
the
trees
the
third
day
seeking
a
passage
through
a
rocky
defile
he
beheld
a
man
in
tattered
clothing
whose
beard
and
hair
covered
his
breast
and
shoulders
this
man
stopped
on
seeing
him
observed
him
and
recognized
the
arms
and
bearing
of
a
french
knight
he
immediately
approached
and
exclaimed
in
the
language
of
the
south
of
france
god
be
praised
do
i
indeed
behold
a
chevalier
of
my
own
country
after
fifteen
years
passed
in
this
desert
without
seeing
the
face
of
a
huon
to
gratify
him
still
more
unlaced
his
helmet
and
came
towards
him
with
a
smiling
countenance
the
other
regarded
him
with
more
surprise
than
at
first
good
heaven
he
exclaimed
was
there
ever
such
a
resemblance
ah
noble
sir
he
added
tell
me
i
beseech
you
of
what
country
and
race
you
come
i
require
replied
huon
before
telling
you
mine
that
you
first
reveal
your
own
let
it
suffice
you
at
present
to
know
that
i
am
a
christian
and
that
in
guienne
i
was
born
ah
heaven
grant
that
my
eyes
and
my
heart
do
not
deceive
me
exclaimed
the
unknown
my
name
is
sherasmin
i
am
brother
to
guire
the
mayor
of
bordeaux
i
was
taken
prisoner
in
the
battle
where
my
dear
and
illustrious
master
sevinus
lost
his
life
for
three
years
i
endured
the
miseries
of
slavery
at
length
i
broke
my
chains
and
escaped
to
this
desert
where
i
have
sustained
myself
in
solitude
ever
since
your
features
recall
to
me
my
beloved
sovereign
in
whose
service
i
was
from
my
infancy
till
his
death
huon
made
no
reply
but
by
embracing
the
old
man
with
tears
in
his
eyes
then
sherasmin
learned
that
his
arms
enfolded
the
son
of
the
duke
sevinus
he
led
him
to
his
cabin
and
spread
before
him
the
dry
fruits
and
honey
which
formed
his
only
aliment
huon
recounted
his
adventures
to
sherasmin
who
was
moved
to
tears
at
the
recital
he
then
consulted
him
on
means
of
conducting
his
enterprise
sherasmin
hesitated
not
to
confess
that
success
seemed
impossible
nevertheless
he
swore
a
solemn
oath
never
to
abandon
him
the
saracen
language
which
he
was
master
of
would
be
serviceable
to
them
when
they
should
leave
the
desert
and
mingle
with
men
they
took
the
route
of
the
red
sea
and
entered
arabia
their
way
lay
through
a
region
which
sherasmin
described
as
full
of
terrors
it
was
inhabited
by
oberon
king
of
the
fairies
who
made
captive
such
knights
as
were
rash
enough
to
penetrate
into
it
and
transformed
them
into
hobgoblins
it
was
possible
to
avoid
this
district
at
the
expense
of
somewhat
lengthening
their
route
but
no
dangers
could
deter
huon
of
bordeaux
and
the
brave
sherasmin
who
had
now
resumed
the
armor
of
a
knight
reluctantly
consented
to
share
with
him
the
dangers
of
the
shorter
route
they
entered
a
wood
and
arrived
at
a
spot
whence
alleys
branched
off
in
various
directions
one
of
them
seemed
to
be
terminated
by
a
superb
palace
whose
gilded
roofs
were
adorned
with
brilliant
weathercocks
covered
with
diamonds
a
superb
chariot
issued
from
the
gate
of
the
palace
and
drove
toward
huon
and
his
companion
as
if
to
meet
them
the
prince
saw
no
one
in
the
chariot
but
a
child
apparently
about
five
years
old
very
beautiful
and
clad
in
a
robe
which
glittered
with
precious
stones
at
the
sight
of
him
sherasmin
terror
was
extreme
he
seized
the
reins
of
huon
horse
and
turned
him
about
hurrying
the
prince
away
and
assuring
him
that
they
were
lost
if
they
stopped
to
parley
with
the
mischievous
dwarf
who
though
he
appeared
a
child
was
full
of
years
and
of
treachery
huon
was
sorry
to
lose
sight
of
the
beautiful
dwarf
whose
aspect
had
nothing
in
it
to
alarm
yet
he
followed
his
friend
who
urged
on
his
horse
with
all
possible
speed
presently
a
storm
began
to
roar
through
the
forest
the
daylight
grew
dim
and
they
found
their
way
with
difficulty
from
time
to
time
they
seemed
to
hear
an
infantine
voice
which
said
stop
duke
huon
listen
to
me
it
is
in
vain
you
fly
me
sherasmin
only
fled
the
faster
and
stopped
not
until
he
had
reached
the
gate
of
a
monastery
of
monks
and
nuns
the
two
communities
of
which
were
assembled
at
that
time
in
a
religious
procession
sherasmin
feeling
safe
from
the
malice
of
the
dwarf
in
the
presence
of
so
many
holy
persons
and
the
sacred
banners
stopped
to
ask
an
asylum
and
made
huon
dismount
also
but
at
that
moment
they
were
joined
by
the
dwarf
who
blew
a
blast
upon
an
ivory
horn
which
hung
from
his
neck
immediately
the
good
sherasmin
in
spite
of
himself
began
to
dance
like
a
young
collegian
and
seizing
the
hand
of
an
aged
nun
who
felt
as
if
it
would
be
her
death
they
footed
it
briskly
over
the
grass
and
were
imitated
by
all
the
other
monks
and
nuns
mingled
together
forming
the
strangest
ever
beheld
huron
alone
felt
no
disposition
to
dance
but
he
came
near
dying
of
laughter
at
seeing
the
ridiculous
postures
and
leaps
of
the
others
the
dwarf
approaching
huon
said
in
a
sweet
voice
and
in
huon
own
language
duke
of
guienne
why
do
you
shun
me
i
conjure
you
in
heaven
name
speak
to
me
huon
hearing
himself
addressed
in
this
serious
manner
and
knowing
that
no
evil
spirit
would
dare
to
use
the
holy
name
in
aid
of
his
schemes
replied
sir
whoever
you
are
i
am
ready
to
hear
and
answer
you
huon
my
friend
continued
the
dwarf
i
always
loved
your
race
and
you
have
been
dear
to
me
ever
since
your
birth
the
gracious
state
of
conscience
in
which
you
were
when
you
entered
my
wood
has
protected
you
from
all
enchantments
even
if
i
had
intended
to
practise
any
upon
you
if
these
monks
these
nuns
and
even
your
friend
sherasmin
had
had
a
conscience
as
pure
as
yours
my
horn
would
not
have
set
them
dancing
but
where
is
the
monk
or
the
nun
who
can
always
be
deaf
to
the
voice
of
the
tempter
and
sherasmin
in
the
desert
has
often
doubted
the
power
of
providence
at
these
words
huon
saw
the
dancers
overcome
with
exertion
he
begged
mercy
for
them
the
dwarf
granted
it
and
the
effect
of
the
horn
ceased
at
once
the
nuns
got
rid
of
their
partners
smoothed
their
dresses
and
hastened
to
resume
their
places
in
the
procession
sherasmin
overcome
with
heat
panting
and
unable
to
stand
on
his
legs
threw
himself
upon
the
grass
and
began
did
not
i
tell
you
he
was
going
on
in
an
angry
tone
but
the
dwarf
approaching
said
sherasmin
why
have
you
murmured
against
providence
why
have
you
thought
evil
of
me
you
deserved
this
light
punishment
but
i
know
you
to
be
good
and
loyal
i
mean
to
show
myself
your
friend
as
you
shall
soon
see
at
these
words
he
presented
him
a
rich
goblet
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
this
cup
said
he
and
then
believe
that
i
hold
my
power
from
the
god
you
adore
whose
faithful
servant
i
am
as
well
as
you
sherasmin
obeyed
and
on
the
instant
the
cup
was
filled
with
delicious
wine
a
draught
of
which
restored
vigor
to
his
limbs
and
made
him
feel
young
again
overcome
with
gratitude
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
but
the
dwarf
raised
him
and
bade
him
sit
beside
him
and
thus
commenced
his
history
julius
caesar
going
by
sea
to
join
his
army
was
driven
by
a
storm
to
take
shelter
in
the
island
of
celea
where
dwelt
the
fairy
glorianda
from
this
renowned
pair
i
draw
my
birth
i
am
the
inheritor
of
that
which
was
most
admirable
in
each
of
my
parents
my
father
heroic
qualities
and
my
mother
beauty
and
magic
art
but
a
malicious
sister
of
my
mother
in
revenge
for
some
slight
offence
touched
me
with
her
wand
when
i
was
only
five
years
old
and
forbade
me
to
grow
any
bigger
and
my
mother
with
all
her
power
was
unable
to
annul
the
sentence
i
have
thus
continued
infantile
in
appearance
though
full
of
years
and
experience
the
power
which
i
derive
from
my
mother
i
use
sometimes
for
my
own
diversion
but
always
to
promote
justice
and
to
reward
virtue
i
am
able
and
willing
to
assist
you
duke
of
guienne
for
i
know
the
errand
on
which
you
come
hither
i
presage
for
you
if
you
follow
my
counsels
complete
success
and
the
beautiful
clarimunda
for
a
wife
when
he
had
thus
spoken
he
presented
to
huon
the
precious
and
useful
cup
which
had
the
faculty
of
filling
itself
when
a
good
man
took
it
in
his
hand
he
gave
him
also
his
beautiful
horn
of
ivory
saying
to
him
huon
when
you
sound
this
gently
you
will
make
the
hearers
dance
as
you
have
seen
but
if
you
sound
it
forcibly
fear
not
that
i
shall
hear
it
though
at
a
hundred
leagues
distance
and
will
fly
to
your
relief
but
be
careful
not
to
sound
it
in
that
way
unless
upon
the
most
urgent
occasion
oberon
directed
huon
what
course
he
should
take
to
reach
the
country
of
the
sultan
gaudisso
you
will
encounter
great
perils
said
he
before
arriving
there
and
i
fear
me
he
added
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
you
will
not
in
everything
obey
my
directions
and
in
that
case
you
will
suffer
much
calamity
then
he
embraced
huon
and
sherasmin
and
left
them
huon
and
his
follower
travelled
many
days
through
the
desert
before
they
reached
any
inhabited
place
and
all
this
while
the
wonderful
cup
sustained
them
furnishing
them
not
only
wine
but
food
also
at
last
they
came
to
a
great
city
as
day
was
declining
they
entered
its
suburbs
and
sherasmin
who
spoke
the
saracen
language
perfectly
inquired
for
an
inn
where
they
could
pass
the
night
a
person
who
appeared
to
be
one
of
the
principal
inhabitants
seeing
two
strangers
of
respectable
appearance
making
this
inquiry
stepped
forward
and
begged
them
to
accept
the
shelter
of
his
mansion
they
entered
and
their
host
did
the
honors
of
his
abode
with
a
politeness
which
they
were
astonished
to
see
in
a
saracen
he
had
them
served
with
coffee
and
sherbet
and
all
was
conducted
with
great
decorum
till
one
of
the
servants
awkwardly
overturned
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
on
the
host
legs
when
he
started
up
exclaiming
in
very
good
gascon
blood
and
thunder
you
blockhead
you
deserve
to
be
thrown
over
the
mosque
huon
could
not
help
laughing
to
see
the
vivacity
and
the
language
of
his
country
thus
break
out
unawares
the
host
who
had
no
idea
that
his
guests
understood
his
words
was
astonished
when
huon
addressed
him
in
the
dialect
of
his
country
immediately
confidence
was
established
between
them
especially
when
the
domestics
had
retired
the
host
seeing
that
he
was
discovered
and
that
the
two
pretended
saracens
were
from
the
borders
of
the
garonne
embraced
them
and
disclosed
that
he
was
a
christian
huon
who
had
learned
prudence
from
the
advice
of
oberon
to
test
his
host
sincerity
drew
from
his
robe
the
cup
which
the
had
given
him
and
presented
it
empty
to
the
host
a
fair
cup
said
he
but
i
should
like
it
better
if
it
was
full
immediately
it
was
so
the
host
astonished
dared
not
put
it
to
his
lips
drink
boldly
my
dear
said
huon
your
truth
is
proved
by
this
cup
which
only
fills
itself
in
the
hands
of
an
honest
man
the
host
did
not
hesitate
longer
the
cup
passed
freely
from
hand
to
hand
their
mutual
cordiality
increased
as
it
passed
and
each
recounted
his
adventures
those
of
huon
redoubled
his
respect
for
he
recognized
in
him
his
legitimate
sovereign
while
the
host
narrative
was
in
these
words
my
name
is
floriac
this
great
and
strong
city
you
will
hear
with
surprise
and
grief
is
governed
by
a
brother
of
duke
sevinus
and
your
uncle
you
have
no
doubt
heard
that
a
young
brother
of
the
duke
of
guienne
was
stolen
away
from
the
with
his
companions
by
some
corsairs
i
was
then
his
page
and
we
were
carried
by
those
corsairs
to
barbary
where
we
were
sold
for
slaves
the
barbary
prince
sent
us
as
part
of
the
tribute
which
he
yearly
paid
to
his
sovereign
the
sultan
gaudisso
your
uncle
who
had
been
somewhat
puffed
up
by
the
flattery
of
his
attendants
thought
to
increase
his
importance
with
his
new
master
by
telling
him
his
rank
the
sultan
who
like
a
true
mussulman
detested
all
christian
princes
exerted
himself
from
that
moment
to
bring
him
over
to
the
saracen
faith
he
succeeded
but
too
well
your
uncle
seduced
by
the
arts
of
the
santons
and
by
the
pleasures
and
indulgences
which
the
sultan
allowed
him
committed
the
horrid
crime
of
apostasy
he
renounced
his
baptism
and
embraced
mahometanism
gaudisso
then
loaded
him
with
honors
made
him
espouse
one
of
his
nieces
and
sent
him
to
reign
over
this
city
and
adjoining
country
your
uncle
preserved
for
me
the
same
friendship
which
he
had
had
when
a
boy
but
all
his
caresses
and
efforts
could
not
make
me
renounce
my
faith
perhaps
he
respected
me
in
his
heart
for
my
resistance
to
his
persuasions
perhaps
he
had
hopes
of
inducing
me
in
time
to
imitate
him
he
made
me
accompany
him
to
this
city
of
which
he
was
master
he
gave
me
his
confidence
and
permits
me
to
keep
in
my
service
some
christians
whom
i
protect
for
the
sake
of
their
faith
ah
exclaimed
huon
take
me
to
this
guilty
uncle
a
prince
of
the
house
of
guienne
must
he
not
blush
at
the
cowardly
abandonment
of
the
faith
of
his
fathers
alas
replied
floriac
i
fear
he
will
neither
be
sensible
of
shame
at
your
reproaches
nor
of
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
a
nephew
so
worthy
of
his
lineage
brutified
by
sensuality
jealous
of
his
power
which
he
often
exercises
with
cruelty
he
will
more
probably
restrain
you
by
force
or
put
you
to
death
be
it
so
said
the
brave
and
fervent
huon
i
could
not
die
in
a
better
cause
and
i
demand
of
you
to
conduct
me
to
him
after
having
told
him
of
my
arrival
and
my
birth
floriac
still
objected
but
huon
would
take
no
denial
and
he
promised
obedience
next
morning
floriac
waited
upon
the
governor
and
told
him
of
the
arrival
of
his
nephew
huon
of
bordeaux
and
of
the
intention
of
the
prince
to
present
himself
at
his
court
that
very
day
the
governor
surprised
did
not
immediately
answer
though
he
at
once
made
up
his
mind
what
to
do
he
knew
that
floriac
loved
christians
and
the
princes
of
his
native
land
too
well
to
aid
in
any
treason
to
one
of
them
he
therefore
feigned
great
pleasure
at
hearing
of
the
arrival
of
the
eldest
born
of
his
family
at
his
court
he
immediately
sent
floriac
to
find
him
he
caused
his
palace
to
be
put
in
festal
array
his
divan
to
be
assembled
and
after
giving
some
secret
orders
went
himself
to
meet
his
nephew
whom
he
introduced
under
his
proper
name
and
title
to
all
the
great
officers
of
his
court
huon
burned
with
indignation
at
seeing
his
uncle
with
forehead
encircled
with
a
rich
turban
surmounted
with
a
crescent
of
precious
stones
his
natural
candor
made
him
receive
with
pain
the
embraces
which
the
treacherous
governor
lavished
upon
him
meanwhile
the
hope
of
finding
a
suitable
moment
to
reproach
him
for
his
apostasy
made
him
submit
to
those
honors
which
his
uncle
caused
to
be
rendered
to
him
the
governor
evaded
with
address
the
chance
of
being
alone
with
huon
and
spent
all
the
morning
in
taking
him
through
his
gardens
and
palace
at
last
when
the
hour
of
dinner
approached
and
the
governor
took
him
by
the
hand
to
lead
him
into
the
huon
seized
the
opportunity
and
said
to
him
in
a
low
voice
o
my
uncle
o
prince
brother
of
the
duke
sevinus
in
what
condition
have
i
the
grief
and
shame
of
seeing
you
the
governor
pretended
to
be
moved
pressed
his
hand
and
whispered
in
his
ear
silence
my
dear
nephew
morning
i
will
hear
you
fully
huon
comforted
a
little
by
these
words
took
his
seat
at
the
table
by
the
side
of
the
governor
the
mufti
some
cadis
agas
and
santons
filled
the
other
places
sherasmin
sat
down
with
them
but
floriac
who
would
not
lose
sight
of
his
guests
remained
standing
and
passed
in
and
out
to
observe
what
was
going
on
within
the
palace
he
soon
perceived
a
number
of
armed
men
gliding
through
the
passages
and
antechambers
connected
with
the
he
was
about
to
enter
to
give
his
guests
notice
of
what
he
had
seen
when
he
heard
a
violent
noise
and
commotion
in
the
hall
the
cause
was
this
huon
and
sherasmin
were
well
enough
suited
with
the
first
course
and
ate
with
good
appetite
but
the
people
of
their
country
not
being
accustomed
to
drink
only
water
at
their
meals
huon
and
sherasmin
looked
at
one
another
not
very
well
pleased
at
such
a
regimen
huon
laughed
outright
at
the
impatience
of
sherasmin
but
soon
experiencing
the
same
want
himself
he
drew
forth
oberon
cup
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
the
cup
filled
and
he
drank
it
off
and
handed
it
to
sherasmin
who
followed
his
example
the
governor
and
his
officers
seeing
this
abhorred
sign
contracted
their
brows
and
sat
in
silent
consternation
huon
pretended
not
to
observe
it
and
having
filled
the
cup
again
handed
it
to
his
uncle
saying
pray
join
us
dear
uncle
it
is
excellent
bordeaux
wine
the
drink
that
will
be
to
you
like
mother
milk
the
governor
who
often
drank
in
secret
with
his
own
favorite
sultanas
the
wines
of
greece
and
shiraz
never
in
public
drank
anything
but
water
he
had
not
for
a
long
time
tasted
the
excellent
wines
of
his
native
land
he
was
sorely
tempted
to
drink
what
was
now
handed
to
him
it
looked
so
bright
in
the
cup
outshining
the
gold
itself
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
took
the
brimming
goblet
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
when
immediately
it
dried
up
and
disappeared
huon
and
sherasmin
like
gascons
as
they
were
laughed
at
his
astonishment
christian
dogs
he
exclaimed
do
you
dare
to
insult
me
at
my
own
table
but
i
will
soon
be
revenged
at
these
words
he
threw
the
cup
at
the
head
of
his
nephew
who
caught
it
with
his
left
hand
while
with
the
other
he
snatched
the
turban
with
its
crescent
from
the
governor
head
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
all
the
saracens
started
up
from
table
with
loud
outcries
and
prepared
to
avenge
the
insult
huon
and
sherasmin
put
themselves
on
their
defence
and
met
with
their
swords
the
scimitars
directed
against
them
at
this
moment
the
doors
of
the
hall
opened
and
a
crowd
of
soldiers
and
armed
eunuchs
rushed
in
who
joined
in
the
attack
upon
huon
and
sherasmin
the
prince
and
his
followers
took
refuge
on
a
broad
shelf
or
where
they
kept
at
bay
the
crowd
of
assailants
making
the
most
forward
of
them
smart
for
their
audacity
but
more
troops
came
pressing
in
and
the
brave
huon
inspired
by
the
wine
of
bordeaux
and
not
angry
enough
to
lose
his
relish
for
a
joke
blew
a
gentle
note
on
his
horn
and
no
sooner
was
it
heard
than
it
quelled
the
rage
of
the
combatants
and
set
them
to
dancing
huon
and
sherasmin
no
longer
attacked
looked
down
from
their
elevated
position
on
a
scene
the
most
singular
and
amusing
very
soon
the
sultanas
hearing
the
sound
of
the
dance
and
finding
their
guards
withdrawn
came
into
the
hall
and
mixed
with
the
dancers
the
favorite
sultana
seized
upon
a
young
santon
who
performed
jumps
two
feet
high
but
soon
the
long
dresses
of
this
couple
got
intermingled
and
threw
them
down
the
santon
beard
was
caught
in
the
sultana
necklace
and
they
could
not
disentangle
them
the
governor
by
no
means
approved
this
familiarity
and
took
two
steps
forward
to
get
at
the
santon
but
he
stumbled
over
a
prostrate
dervise
and
measured
his
length
on
the
floor
the
dancing
continued
till
the
strength
of
the
performers
was
exhausted
and
they
fell
one
after
the
other
and
lay
helpless
the
governor
at
length
made
signs
to
huon
that
he
would
yield
everything
if
he
would
but
allow
him
to
rest
the
bargain
was
ratified
the
governor
allowed
huon
and
sherasmin
to
depart
on
their
way
and
even
gave
them
a
ring
which
would
procure
them
safe
passage
through
his
country
and
access
to
the
sultan
gaudisso
the
two
friends
hastened
to
avail
themselves
of
this
favorable
turn
and
taking
leave
of
floriac
pursued
their
journey
huon
of
bordeaux
continued
huon
had
seen
many
beauties
at
his
mother
court
but
his
heart
had
never
been
touched
with
love
honor
had
been
his
mistress
and
in
pursuit
of
that
he
had
never
found
time
to
give
a
thought
to
softer
cares
strange
that
a
heart
so
insensible
should
first
be
touched
by
something
so
unsubstantial
as
a
dream
but
so
it
was
the
day
after
the
adventure
with
his
uncle
night
overtook
the
travellers
as
they
passed
through
a
forest
a
grotto
offered
them
shelter
from
the
night
dews
the
magic
cup
supplied
their
evening
meal
for
such
was
its
virtue
that
it
afforded
not
only
wine
but
more
solid
fare
when
desired
fatigue
soon
threw
them
into
profound
repose
lulled
by
the
murmur
of
the
foliage
and
breathing
the
fragrance
of
the
flowers
huon
dreamed
that
a
lady
more
beautiful
than
he
had
ever
before
seen
hung
over
him
and
imprinted
a
kiss
upon
his
lips
as
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
embrace
her
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
swept
her
away
huon
awoke
in
an
agony
of
regret
a
few
moments
sufficed
to
afford
some
consolation
in
showing
him
that
what
had
passed
was
but
a
dream
but
his
perplexity
and
sadness
could
not
escape
the
notice
of
sherasmin
huon
hesitated
not
to
inform
his
faithful
follower
of
the
reason
of
his
pensiveness
and
got
nothing
in
return
but
his
rallyings
for
allowing
himself
to
be
disturbed
by
such
a
cause
he
recommended
a
draught
from
the
fairy
goblet
and
huon
tried
it
with
good
effect
at
early
dawn
they
resumed
their
way
they
travelled
till
high
noon
but
said
little
to
one
another
huon
was
musing
on
his
dream
and
sherasmin
thoughts
flew
back
to
his
early
days
on
the
banks
of
the
flowery
garonne
on
a
sudden
they
were
startled
by
the
cry
of
distress
and
turning
an
angle
of
the
wood
came
where
a
knight
hard
pressed
was
fighting
with
a
furious
lion
the
knight
horse
lay
dead
and
it
seemed
as
if
another
moment
would
end
the
combat
for
terror
and
fatigue
had
quite
disabled
the
knight
for
further
resistance
he
fell
and
the
lion
paw
was
raised
over
him
when
a
blow
from
huon
sword
turned
the
rage
upon
a
new
enemy
his
roar
shook
the
forest
and
he
crouched
in
act
to
spring
when
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
huon
plunged
his
sword
into
his
side
he
rolled
over
on
the
plain
in
the
agonies
of
death
they
raised
the
knight
from
the
ground
and
sherasmin
hastened
to
offer
him
a
draught
from
the
fairy
cup
the
wine
sparkled
to
the
brim
and
the
warrior
put
forth
his
lips
to
quaff
it
but
it
shrunk
away
and
did
not
even
wet
his
lips
he
dashed
the
goblet
angrily
on
the
ground
with
an
exclamation
of
resentment
this
incident
did
not
tend
to
make
either
party
more
acceptable
to
the
other
and
what
followed
was
worse
for
when
huon
said
sir
knight
thank
god
for
your
deliverance
thank
mahomet
rather
yourself
said
he
for
he
has
led
you
this
day
to
render
service
to
no
less
a
personage
than
the
prince
of
hyrcania
at
the
sound
of
this
blasphemy
huon
drew
his
sword
and
turned
upon
the
miscreant
who
little
disposed
to
encounter
the
prowess
of
which
he
had
so
lately
seen
proof
betook
himself
to
flight
he
ran
to
horse
and
lightly
vaulting
on
his
back
clapped
spurs
to
his
side
and
galloped
out
of
sight
the
adventure
was
vexatious
yet
there
was
no
remedy
the
prince
and
sherasmin
continued
their
journey
with
the
aid
of
the
remaining
horse
as
they
best
might
at
length
as
evening
set
in
they
descried
the
pinnacles
and
towers
of
a
great
city
full
before
them
which
they
knew
to
be
the
famous
city
of
bagdad
they
were
exhausted
with
fatigue
when
they
arrived
at
its
precincts
and
in
the
darkness
not
knowing
what
course
to
take
were
glad
to
meet
an
aged
woman
who
in
reply
to
their
inquiries
offered
them
such
accommodations
as
her
cottage
could
supply
they
thankfully
accepted
the
offer
and
entered
the
low
door
the
good
dame
busily
prepared
the
best
fare
her
stores
supplied
milk
figs
and
peaches
deeply
regretting
that
the
bleak
winds
had
nipped
her
sir
huon
thought
he
had
never
in
his
life
tasted
any
fare
so
good
the
old
lady
talked
while
her
guests
ate
she
doubted
not
she
said
they
had
come
to
be
present
at
the
great
feast
in
honor
of
the
marriage
of
the
sultan
daughter
which
was
to
take
place
on
the
morrow
they
asked
who
the
bridegroom
was
to
be
and
the
old
lady
answered
the
prince
of
hyrcania
but
added
our
princess
hates
him
and
would
rather
wed
a
dragon
than
him
how
know
you
that
asked
huon
and
the
dame
informed
him
that
she
had
it
from
the
princess
herself
who
was
her
huon
inquired
the
reason
of
the
princess
aversion
and
the
woman
pleased
to
find
her
chat
excite
so
much
interest
replied
that
it
was
all
in
consequence
of
a
dream
a
dream
exclaimed
huon
yes
a
dream
she
dreamed
that
she
was
a
hind
and
that
the
prince
as
a
hunter
was
pursuing
her
and
had
almost
overtaken
her
when
a
beautiful
dwarf
appeared
in
view
drawn
in
a
golden
car
having
by
his
side
a
young
man
of
yellow
hair
and
fair
complexion
like
one
from
a
foreign
land
she
dreamed
that
the
car
stopped
where
she
stood
and
that
having
resumed
her
own
form
she
was
about
to
ascend
it
when
suddenly
it
faded
from
her
view
and
with
it
the
dwarf
and
the
youth
but
from
her
heart
that
vision
did
not
fade
and
from
that
time
her
affianced
bridegroom
the
hyrcanian
prince
had
become
odious
to
her
sight
yet
the
sultan
her
father
by
no
means
regarding
such
a
cause
as
sufficient
to
prevent
the
marriage
had
named
the
morrow
as
the
time
when
it
should
be
solemnized
in
presence
of
his
court
and
many
princes
of
the
neighboring
countries
whom
the
fame
of
the
princess
beauty
and
the
bridegroom
splendor
had
brought
to
the
scene
we
may
suppose
this
conversation
woke
a
tumult
of
thoughts
in
the
breast
of
huon
was
it
not
clear
that
providence
led
him
on
and
cleared
the
way
for
his
happy
success
sleep
did
not
early
visit
the
eyes
of
huon
that
night
but
with
the
sanguine
temper
of
youth
he
indulged
his
fancy
in
imagining
the
sequel
of
his
strange
experience
the
next
day
which
he
could
not
but
regard
as
the
decisive
day
of
his
fate
he
prepared
to
deliver
the
message
of
charlemagne
clad
in
his
armor
fortified
with
his
ivory
horn
and
his
ring
he
reached
the
palace
of
gaudisso
when
the
guests
were
assembled
at
the
banquet
as
he
approached
the
gate
a
voice
called
on
all
true
believers
to
enter
and
huon
the
brave
and
faithful
huon
in
his
impatience
passed
in
under
that
false
pretention
he
had
no
sooner
passed
the
barrier
than
he
felt
ashamed
of
his
baseness
and
was
overwhelmed
with
regret
to
make
amends
for
his
fault
he
ran
forward
to
the
second
gate
and
cried
to
the
porter
dog
of
a
misbeliever
i
command
you
in
the
name
of
him
who
died
on
the
cross
open
to
me
the
points
of
a
hundred
weapons
immediately
opposed
his
passage
huon
then
remembered
for
the
first
time
the
ring
he
had
received
from
his
uncle
the
governor
he
produced
it
and
demanded
to
be
led
to
the
sultan
presence
the
officer
of
the
guard
recognized
the
ring
made
a
respectful
obeisance
and
allowed
him
free
entrance
in
the
same
way
he
passed
the
other
doors
to
the
rich
saloon
where
the
great
sultan
was
at
dinner
with
his
tributary
princes
at
sight
of
the
ring
the
chief
attendant
led
huon
to
the
head
of
the
hall
and
introduced
him
to
the
sultan
and
his
princes
as
the
ambassador
of
charlemagne
a
seat
was
provided
for
him
near
the
royal
party
the
prince
of
hyrcania
the
same
whom
huon
had
rescued
from
the
lion
and
who
was
the
destined
bridegroom
of
the
beautiful
clarimunda
sat
on
the
sultan
right
hand
and
the
princess
herself
on
his
left
it
chanced
that
huon
found
himself
near
the
seat
of
the
princess
and
hardly
were
the
ceremonies
of
reception
over
before
he
made
haste
to
fulfill
the
commands
of
charlemagne
by
imprinting
a
kiss
upon
her
rosy
lips
and
after
that
a
second
not
by
command
but
by
good
will
the
prince
of
hyrcania
cried
out
audacious
infidel
take
the
reward
of
thy
insolence
and
aimed
a
blow
at
huon
which
if
it
had
reached
him
would
have
brought
his
embassy
to
a
speedy
termination
but
the
ingrate
failed
of
his
aim
and
huon
punished
his
blasphemy
and
ingratitude
at
once
by
a
blow
which
severed
his
head
from
his
body
so
suddenly
had
all
this
happened
that
no
hand
had
been
raised
to
arrest
it
but
now
gaudisso
cried
out
seize
the
murderer
huon
was
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
but
his
redoubtable
sword
kept
the
crowd
of
courtiers
at
bay
but
he
saw
new
combatants
enter
and
could
not
hope
to
maintain
his
ground
against
so
many
he
recollected
his
horn
and
raising
it
to
his
lips
blew
a
blast
almost
as
loud
as
that
of
roland
at
roncesvalles
it
was
in
vain
oberon
heard
it
but
the
sin
of
which
huon
had
been
guilty
in
bearing
though
but
for
a
moment
the
character
of
a
believer
in
the
false
prophet
had
put
it
out
of
oberon
power
to
help
him
huon
finding
himself
deserted
and
conscious
of
the
cause
lost
his
strength
and
energy
was
seized
loaded
with
chains
and
plunged
into
a
dungeon
his
life
was
spared
for
the
time
merely
that
he
might
be
reserved
for
a
more
painful
death
the
sultan
meant
that
after
being
made
to
feel
all
the
torments
of
hunger
and
despair
he
should
be
flayed
alive
but
an
enchanter
more
ancient
and
more
powerful
than
oberon
himself
interested
himself
for
the
brave
huon
the
enchanter
was
love
the
princess
clarimunda
learned
with
horror
the
fate
to
which
the
young
prince
was
destined
by
the
aid
of
her
governante
she
gained
over
the
keeper
of
the
prison
and
went
herself
to
lighten
the
chains
of
her
beloved
it
was
her
hand
that
removed
his
fetters
from
her
he
received
supplies
of
food
to
sustain
a
life
which
he
devoted
from
thenceforth
wholly
to
her
after
the
most
tender
explanations
the
princess
departed
promising
to
repeat
her
visit
on
the
morrow
the
next
day
she
came
according
to
promise
and
again
brought
supplies
of
food
these
visits
were
continued
during
a
whole
month
huon
was
too
good
a
son
of
the
church
to
forget
that
the
amiable
princess
was
a
saracen
and
he
availed
himself
of
these
interviews
to
instruct
her
in
the
true
faith
how
easy
it
is
to
believe
the
truth
when
uttered
by
the
lips
of
those
we
love
clarimunda
ere
long
professed
her
entire
belief
in
the
christian
doctrines
and
desired
to
be
baptized
meanwhile
the
sultan
had
repeatedly
inquired
of
the
jailer
how
his
prisoner
bore
the
pains
of
famine
and
learned
to
his
surprise
that
he
was
not
yet
much
reduced
thereby
on
his
repeating
the
inquiry
after
a
short
interval
the
keeper
replied
that
the
prisoner
had
died
suddenly
and
had
been
buried
in
the
cavern
the
sultan
could
only
regret
that
he
had
not
sooner
ordered
the
execution
of
the
sentence
while
these
things
were
going
on
the
faithful
sherasmin
who
had
not
accompanied
huon
in
his
last
adventure
but
had
learned
by
common
rumor
the
result
of
it
came
to
the
court
in
hopes
of
doing
something
for
the
rescue
of
his
master
he
presented
himself
to
the
sultan
as
solario
his
nephew
guadisso
received
him
with
kindness
and
all
the
courtiers
loaded
him
with
attentions
he
soon
found
means
to
inform
himself
how
the
princess
regarded
the
brave
but
unfortunate
huon
and
having
made
himself
known
to
her
confidence
was
soon
established
between
them
clarimunda
readily
consented
to
assist
in
the
escape
of
huon
and
to
quit
with
him
her
father
court
to
repair
to
that
of
charlemagne
their
united
efforts
had
nearly
perfected
their
arrangement
a
vessel
was
secretly
prepared
and
all
things
in
forwardness
for
the
flight
when
an
obstacle
presented
itself
huon
himself
positively
refused
to
go
leaving
the
orders
of
charlemagne
unexecuted
sherasmin
was
in
despair
bitterly
he
complained
of
the
fickleness
and
cruelty
of
oberon
in
withdrawing
his
aid
at
the
very
crisis
when
it
was
most
necessary
earnestly
he
urged
every
argument
to
satisfy
the
prince
that
he
had
done
enough
for
honor
and
could
not
be
held
bound
to
achieve
impossibilities
but
all
was
of
no
avail
and
he
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
when
one
of
those
events
occurred
which
are
so
frequent
under
turkish
despotisms
a
courier
arrived
at
the
court
of
the
sultan
bearing
the
ring
of
his
sovereign
the
mighty
agrapard
caliph
of
arabia
and
bringing
the
for
the
neck
of
gaudisso
no
reason
was
assigned
none
but
the
pleasure
of
the
caliph
is
ever
required
in
such
cases
but
it
was
suspected
that
the
bearer
of
the
had
persuaded
the
caliph
that
gaudisso
whose
rapacity
was
well
known
had
accumulated
immense
treasures
which
he
had
not
duly
shared
with
his
sovereign
and
thus
had
obtained
an
order
to
supersede
him
in
his
emirship
the
body
of
gaudisso
would
have
been
cast
out
a
prey
to
dogs
and
vultures
had
not
sherasmin
under
the
character
of
nephew
of
the
deceased
been
permitted
to
receive
it
and
give
it
decent
burial
which
he
did
but
not
till
he
had
taken
possession
of
the
beard
and
grinders
agreeably
to
the
orders
of
charlemagne
no
obstacle
now
stood
in
the
way
of
the
lovers
and
their
faithful
follower
in
returning
to
france
they
sailed
taking
rome
in
their
way
where
the
holy
father
himself
blessed
the
union
of
his
nephew
duke
huon
of
bordeaux
with
the
princess
clarimunda
soon
afterward
they
arrived
in
france
where
huon
laid
his
trophies
at
the
feet
of
charlemagne
and
being
restored
to
the
favor
of
the
emperor
hastened
to
present
himself
and
his
bride
to
the
duchess
his
mother
and
to
the
faithful
liegemen
of
his
province
of
guienne
and
his
city
of
bordeaux
where
the
pair
were
received
with
transports
of
joy
ogier
the
dane
ogier
the
dane
was
the
son
of
geoffrey
who
wrested
denmark
from
the
pagans
and
reigned
the
first
christian
king
of
that
country
when
ogier
was
born
and
before
he
was
baptized
six
ladies
of
ravishing
beauty
appeared
all
at
once
in
the
chamber
of
the
infant
they
encircled
him
and
she
who
appeared
the
eldest
took
him
in
her
arms
kissed
him
and
laid
her
hand
upon

of

she
delivered
the

her

who
said
i

you
abundant

sister
said
the

dangerous
boon
i
give

that
he
shall
never
be
vanquished
the

added
as
she
laid
her

upon
his

his

i

gift

i
give
you
not
to

till
you
shall
have
come
to
pay
me
a
visit
in
my
isle
of
avalon
then
she
kissed
the
child
and
departed
with
her
sisters
after
this
the
king
had
the
child
carried
to
the
font
and
baptized
with
the
name
of
ogier
in
his
education
nothing
was
neglected
to
elevate
him
to
the
standard
of
a
perfect
knight
and
render
him
accomplished
in
all
the
arts
necessary
to
make
him
a
hero
he
had
hardly
reached
the
age
of
sixteen
years
when
charlemagne
whose
power
was
established
over
all
the
sovereigns
of
his
time
recollected
that
geoffroy
ogier
father
had
omitted
to
render
the
homage
due
to
him
as
emperor
and
sovereign
lord
of
denmark
one
of
the
grand
fiefs
of
the
empire
he
accordingly
sent
an
embassy
to
demand
of
the
king
of
denmark
this
homage
and
on
receiving
a
refusal
couched
in
haughty
terms
sent
an
army
to
enforce
the
demand
geoffroy
after
an
unsuccessful
resistance
was
forced
to
comply
and
as
a
pledge
of
his
sincerity
delivered
ogier
his
eldest
son
a
hostage
to
charles
to
be
brought
up
at
his
court
he
was
placed
in
charge
of
the
duke
namo
of
bavaria
the
friend
of
his
father
who
treated
him
like
his
own
son
ogier
grew
up
more
and
more
handsome
and
amiable
every
day
he
surpassed
in
form
strength
and
address
all
the
noble
youths
his
companions
he
failed
not
to
be
present
at
all
tourneys
he
was
attentive
to
the
elder
knights
and
burned
with
impatience
to
imitate
them
yet
his
heart
rose
sometimes
in
secret
against
his
condition
as
a
hostage
and
as
one
apparently
forgotten
by
his
father
the
king
of
denmark
in
fact
was
at
this
time
occupied
with
new
loves
ogier
mother
having
died
he
had
married
a
second
wife
and
had
a
son
named
guyon
the
new
queen
had
absolute
power
over
her
husband
and
fearing
that
if
he
should
see
ogier
again
he
would
give
him
the
preference
over
guyon
she
had
adroitly
persuaded
him
to
delay
rendering
his
homage
to
charlemagne
till
now
four
years
had
passed
away
since
the
last
renewal
of
that
ceremony
charlemagne
irritated
at
this
delinquency
drew
closer
the
bonds
of
ogier
captivity
until
he
should
receive
a
response
from
the
king
of
denmark
to
a
fresh
summons
which
he
caused
to
be
sent
to
him
the
answer
of
geoffroy
was
insulting
and
defiant
and
the
rage
of
charlemagne
was
roused
in
the
highest
degree
he
was
at
first
disposed
to
wreak
his
vengeance
upon
ogier
his
hostage
but
at
the
entreaties
of
duke
namo
who
felt
towards
his
pupil
like
a
father
consented
to
spare
his
life
if
ogier
would
swear
fidelity
to
him
as
his
and
promise
not
to
quit
his
court
without
his
permission
ogier
accepted
these
terms
and
was
allowed
to
retain
all
the
freedom
he
had
before
enjoyed
the
emperor
would
have
immediately
taken
arms
to
reduce
his
disobedient
vassal
if
he
had
not
been
called
off
in
another
direction
by
a
message
from
pope
leo
imploring
his
assistance
the
saracens
had
landed
in
the
neighborhood
of
rome
occupied
mount
janiculum
and
prepared
to
pass
the
tiber
and
carry
fire
and
sword
to
the
capital
of
the
christian
world
charlemagne
hesitated
not
to
yield
to
the
entreaties
of
the
pope
he
speedily
assembled
an
army
crossed
the
alps
traversed
italy
and
arrived
at
spoleto
a
strong
place
to
which
the
pope
had
retired
leo
at
the
head
of
his
cardinals
advanced
to
meet
him
and
rendered
him
homage
as
to
the
son
of
pepin
the
illustrious
protector
of
the
holy
see
coming
as
his
father
had
done
to
defend
it
in
the
hour
of
need
charlemagne
stopped
but
two
days
at
spoleto
and
learning
that
the
infidels
having
rendered
themselves
masters
of
rome
were
besieging
the
capitol
which
could
not
long
hold
out
against
them
marched
promptly
to
attack
them
the
advanced
posts
of
the
army
were
commanded
by
duke
namo
on
whom
ogier
waited
as
his
squire
he
did
not
yet
bear
arms
not
having
received
the
order
of
knighthood
the
oriflamme
the
royal
standard
was
borne
by
a
knight
named
alory
who
showed
himself
unworthy
of
the
honor
duke
namo
seeing
a
strong
body
of
the
infidels
advancing
to
attack
him
gave
the
word
to
charge
them
ogier
remained
in
the
rear
with
the
other
youths
grieving
much
that
he
was
not
permitted
to
fight
very
soon
he
saw
alory
lower
the
oriflamme
and
turn
his
horse
in
flight
ogier
pointed
him
out
to
the
young
men
and
seizing
a
club
rushed
upon
alory
and
struck
him
from
his
horse
then
with
his
companions
he
disarmed
him
clothed
himself
in
his
armor
raised
the
oriflamme
and
mounting
the
horse
of
the
unworthy
knight
flew
to
the
front
rank
where
he
joined
duke
namo
drove
back
the
infidels
and
carried
the
oriflamme
quite
through
their
broken
ranks
the
duke
thinking
it
was
alory
whom
he
had
not
held
in
high
esteem
was
astonished
at
his
strength
and
valor
ogier
young
companions
imitated
him
supplying
themselves
with
armor
from
the
bodies
of
the
slain
they
followed
ogier
and
carried
death
into
the
ranks
of
the
saracens
who
fell
back
in
confusion
upon
their
main
body
duke
namo
now
ordered
a
retreat
and
ogier
obeyed
with
reluctance
when
they
perceived
charlemagne
advancing
to
their
assistance
the
combat
now
became
general
and
was
more
terrible
than
ever
charlemagne
had
overthrown
corsuble
the
commander
of
the
saracens
and
had
drawn
his
famous
sword
joyeuse
to
cut
off
his
head
when
two
saracen
knights
set
upon
him
at
once
one
of
whom
slew
his
horse
and
the
other
overthrew
the
emperor
on
the
sand
perceiving
by
the
eagle
on
his
casque
who
he
was
they
dismounted
in
haste
to
give
him
his
deathblow
never
was
the
life
of
the
emperor
in
such
peril
but
ogier
who
saw
him
fall
flew
to
his
rescue
though
embarrassed
with
the
oriflamme
he
pushed
his
horse
against
one
of
the
saracens
and
knocked
him
down
and
with
his
sword
dealt
the
other
so
vigorous
a
blow
that
he
fell
stunned
to
the
earth
then
helping
the
emperor
to
rise
he
remounted
him
on
the
horse
of
one
of
the
fallen
knights
brave
and
generous
alory
charles
exclaimed
i
owe
to
you
my
honor
and
my
life
ogier
made
no
answer
but
leaving
charlemagne
surrounded
by
a
great
many
of
the
knights
who
had
flown
to
his
succor
he
plunged
into
the
thickest
ranks
of
the
enemy
and
carried
the
oriflamme
followed
by
a
gallant
train
of
youthful
warriors
till
the
standard
of
mahomet
turned
in
retreat
and
the
infidels
sought
safety
in
their
intrenchments
then
the
good
archbishop
turpin
laid
aside
his
helmet
and
his
bloody
sword
for
he
always
felt
that
he
was
clearly
in
the
line
of
his
duty
while
slaying
infidels
took
his
mitre
and
his
crosier
and
intoned
te
deum
at
this
moment
ogier
covered
with
blood
and
dust
came
to
lay
the
oriflamme
at
the
feet
of
the
emperor
he
was
followed
by
a
train
of
warriors
of
short
stature
who
walked
ill
at
ease
loaded
with
armor
too
heavy
for
them
ogier
knelt
at
the
feet
of
charlemagne
who
embraced
him
calling
him
alory
while
turpin
from
the
height
of
the
altar
blessed
him
with
all
his
might
then
young
orlando
son
of
the
count
milone
and
nephew
of
charlemagne
no
longer
able
to
endure
this
misapprehension
threw
down
his
helmet
and
ran
to
unlace
ogier
while
the
other
young
men
laid
aside
theirs
our
author
says
he
can
not
express
the
surprise
the
admiration
and
the
tenderness
of
the
emperor
and
his
peers
charles
folded
ogier
in
his
arms
and
the
happy
fathers
of
those
brave
youths
embraced
them
with
tears
of
joy
the
good
duke
namo
stepped
forward
and
charlemagne
yielded
ogier
to
his
embrace
how
much
do
i
owe
you
he
said
good
and
wise
friend
for
having
restrained
my
anger
my
dear
ogier
i
owe
you
my
life
my
sword
leaps
to
touch
your
shoulder
yours
and
those
of
your
brave
young
friends
at
these
words
he
drew
that
famous
sword
joyeuse
and
while
ogier
and
the
rest
knelt
before
him
gave
them
the
accolade
conferring
on
them
the
order
of
knighthood
the
young
orlando
and
his
cousin
oliver
could
not
refrain
even
in
the
presence
of
the
emperor
from
falling
upon
ogier
neck
and
pledging
with
him
that
brotherhood
in
arms
so
dear
and
so
sacred
to
the
knights
of
old
times
but
charlot
the
son
at
the
sight
of
the
glory
with
which
ogier
had
covered
himself
conceived
the
blackest
jealousy
and
hate
the
rest
of
the
day
and
the
next
were
spent
in
the
rejoicings
of
the
army
turpin
in
a
solemn
service
implored
the
favor
of
heaven
upon
the
youthful
knights
and
blessed
the
white
armor
which
was
prepared
for
them
duke
namo
presented
them
with
golden
spurs
charles
himself
girded
on
their
swords
but
what
was
his
astonishment
when
he
examined
that
intended
for
ogier
the
loving
fairy
morgana
had
had
the
art
to
change
it
and
to
substitute
one
of
her
own
procuring
and
when
charles
drew
it
out
of
the
scabbard
these
words
appeared
written
on
the
steel
my
name
is
cortana
of
the
same
steel
and
temper
as
joyeuse
and
durindana
charles
saw
that
a
superior
power
watched
over
the
destinies
of
ogier
he
vowed
to
love
him
as
a
father
would
and
ogier
promised
him
the
devotion
of
a
son
happy
had
it
been
for
both
if
they
had
always
continued
mindful
of
their
promises
the
saracen
army
had
hardly
recovered
from
its
dismay
when
carahue
king
of
mauritania
who
was
one
of
the
knights
overthrown
by
ogier
at
the
time
of
the
rescue
of
charlemagne
determined
to
challenge
him
to
single
combat
with
that
view
he
assumed
the
dress
of
a
herald
resolved
to
carry
his
own
message
the
french
knights
admired
his
air
and
said
to
one
another
that
he
seemed
more
fit
to
be
a
knight
than
a
bearer
of
messages
carahue
began
by
passing
the
warmest
eulogium
upon
the
knight
who
bore
the
oriflamme
on
the
day
of
the
battle
and
concluded
by
saying
that
carahue
king
of
mauritania
respected
that
knight
so
much
that
he
challenged
him
to
the
combat
ogier
had
risen
to
reply
when
he
was
interrupted
by
charlot
who
said
that
the
gage
of
the
king
of
mauritania
could
not
fitly
be
received
by
a
vassal
living
in
captivity
by
which
he
meant
ogier
who
was
at
that
time
serving
as
hostage
for
his
father
fire
flashed
from
the
eyes
of
ogier
but
the
presence
of
the
emperor
restrained
his
speech
and
he
was
calmed
by
the
kind
looks
of
charlemagne
who
said
with
an
angry
voice
silence
charlot
by
the
life
of
bertha
my
queen
he
who
has
saved
my
life
is
as
dear
to
me
as
yourself
ogier
he
continued
you
are
no
longer
a
hostage
herald
report
my
answer
to
your
master
that
never
does
knight
of
my
court
refuse
a
challenge
on
equal
terms
ogier
the
dane
accepts
of
his
and
i
myself
am
his
security
carahue
profoundly
bowing
replied
my
lord
i
was
sure
that
the
sentiments
of
so
great
a
sovereign
as
yourself
would
be
worthy
of
your
high
and
brilliant
fame
i
shall
report
your
answer
to
my
master
who
i
know
admires
you
and
unwillingly
takes
arms
against
you
then
turning
to
charlot
whom
he
did
not
know
as
the
son
of
the
emperor
he
continued
as
for
you
sir
knight
if
the
desire
of
battle
inflames
you
i
have
it
in
charge
from
sadon
cousin
of
the
king
of
mauritania
to
give
the
like
defiance
to
any
french
knights
who
will
grant
him
the
honor
of
the
combat
charlot
inflamed
with
rage
and
vexation
at
the
public
reproof
which
he
had
just
received
hesitated
not
to
deliver
his
gage
carahue
received
it
with
ogier
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
combat
should
be
on
the
next
day
in
a
meadow
environed
by
woods
and
equally
distant
from
both
armies
the
perfidious
charlot
meditated
the
blackest
treason
during
the
night
he
collected
some
knights
unworthy
of
the
name
and
like
himself
in
their
ferocious
manners
he
made
them
swear
to
avenge
his
injuries
armed
them
in
black
armor
and
sent
them
to
lie
in
ambush
in
the
wood
with
orders
to
make
a
pretended
attack
upon
the
whole
party
but
in
fact
to
lay
heavy
hands
upon
ogier
and
the
two
saracens
at
the
dawn
of
day
sadon
and
carahue
attended
only
by
two
pages
to
carry
their
spears
took
their
way
to
the
appointed
meadow
and
charlot
and
ogier
repaired
thither
also
but
by
different
paths
ogier
advanced
with
a
calm
air
saluted
courteously
the
two
saracen
knights
and
joined
them
in
arranging
the
terms
of
combat
while
this
was
going
on
the
perfidious
charlot
remained
behind
and
gave
his
men
the
signal
to
advance
that
cowardly
troop
issued
from
the
wood
and
encompassed
the
three
knights
all
three
were
equally
surprised
at
the
attack
but
neither
of
them
suspected
the
other
to
have
any
hand
in
the
treason
seeing
the
attack
made
equally
upon
them
all
they
united
their
efforts
to
resist
it
and
made
the
most
forward
of
the
assailants
bite
the
dust
cortana
fell
on
no
one
without
inflicting
a
mortal
wound
but
the
sword
of
carahue
was
not
of
equal
temper
and
broke
in
his
hands
at
the
same
instant
his
horse
was
slain
and
carahue
fell
without
a
weapon
and
entangled
with
his
prostrate
horse
ogier
who
saw
it
ran
to
his
defence
and
leaping
to
the
ground
covered
the
prince
with
his
shield
supplied
him
with
the
sword
of
one
of
the
fallen
ruffians
and
would
have
him
mount
his
own
horse
at
that
moment
charlot
inflamed
with
rage
pushed
his
horse
upon
ogier
knocked
him
down
and
would
have
run
him
through
with
his
lance
if
sadon
who
saw
the
treason
had
not
sprung
upon
him
and
thrust
him
back
carahue
leapt
lightly
upon
the
horse
which
ogier
presented
him
and
had
time
only
to
exclaim
brave
ogier
i
am
no
longer
your
enemy
i
pledge
to
you
an
eternal
friendship
when
numerous
saracen
knights
were
seen
approaching
having
discovered
the
treachery
and
charlot
with
his
followers
took
refuge
in
the
wood
the
troop
which
advanced
was
commanded
by
dannemont
the
exiled
king
of
denmark
whom
geoffroy
ogier
father
had
driven
from
his
throne
and
compelled
to
take
refuge
with
the
saracens
learning
who
ogier
was
he
instantly
declared
him
his
prisoner
in
spite
of
the
urgent
remonstrances
and
even
threats
of
carahue
and
sadon
and
carried
him
under
a
strong
guard
to
the
saracen
camp
here
he
was
at
first
subjected
to
the
most
rigorous
captivity
but
carahue
and
sadon
insisted
so
vehemently
on
his
release
threatening
to
turn
their
arms
against
their
own
party
if
it
was
not
granted
while
dannemont
as
eagerly
opposed
the
measure
that
corsuble
the
saracen
commander
consented
to
a
middle
course
and
allowed
ogier
the
freedom
of
his
camp
upon
his
promise
not
to
leave
it
without
permission
carahue
was
not
satisfied
with
this
partial
concession
he
left
the
city
next
morning
proceeded
to
the
camp
of
charlemagne
and
demanded
to
be
led
to
the
emperor
when
he
reached
his
presence
he
dismounted
from
his
horse
took
off
his
helmet
drew
his
sword
and
holding
it
by
the
blade
presented
it
to
charlemagne
as
he
knelt
before
him
illustrious
prince
he
said
behold
before
you
the
herald
who
brought
the
challenge
to
your
knights
from
the
king
of
mauritania
the
cowardly
old
king
dannemont
has
made
the
brave
ogier
prisoner
and
has
prevailed
on

refuse
to
give
him
up

come

for
this
ungenerous
conduct
by
yielding

your
prisoner
charlemagne
with
all
his
peers
admired
the
magnanimity
of
carahue
he
raised
him
embraced
him
and
restored
to
him
his
sword
prince
said
he
your
presence
and
the
bright
example
you
afford
my
knights
consoles
me
for
the
loss
of
ogier
would
to
god
you
might
receive
our
holy
faith
and
be
wholly
united
with
us
all
the
lords
of
the
court
led
by
duke
namo
paid
their
respects
to
the
king
of
mauritania
charlot
only
failed
to
appear
fearing
to
be
recognized
as
a
traitor
but
the
heart
of
carahue
was
too
noble
to
pierce
that
of
charlemagne
by
telling
him
the
treachery
of
his
son
meanwhile
the
saracen
army
was
rent
by
discord
the
troops
of
carahue
clamored
against
the
because
their
king
was
left
in
captivity
they
even
threatened
to
desert
the
cause
and
turn
their
arms
against
their
allies
charlemagne
pressed
the
siege
vigorously
till
at
length
the
saracen
leaders
found
themselves
compelled
to
abandon
the
city
and
betake
themselves
to
their
ships
a
truce
was
made
ogier
was
exchanged
for
carahue
and
the
two
friends
embraced
one
another
with
vows
of
perpetual
brotherhood
the
pope
was
reestablished
in
his
dominions
and
italy
being
tranquil
charlemagne
returned
with
his
peers
and
their
followers
to
france
ogier
the
dane
continued
charlemagne
had
not
forgotten
the
offence
of
geoffroy
the
king
of
denmark
in
withholding
homage
and
now
prepared
to
enforce
submission
but
at
this
crisis
he
was
waited
upon
by
an
embassy
from
geoffroy
acknowledging
his
fault
and
craving
assistance
against
an
army
of
invaders
who
had
attacked
his
states
with
a
force
which
he
was
unable
to
repel
the
soul
of
charlemagne
was
too
great
to
be
implacable
and
he
took
this
opportunity
to
test
that
of
ogier
who
had
felt
acutely
the
unkindness
of
his
father
in
leaving
him
without
regard
or
notice
fifteen
years
in
captivity
charles
asked
ogier
whether
in
spite
of
his
father
neglect
he
was
disposed
to
lead
an
army
to
his
assistance
he
replied
a
son
can
never
be
excused
from
helping
his
father
by
any
cause
short
of
death
charlemagne
placed
an
army
of
a
thousand
knights
under
the
command
of
ogier
and
great
numbers
more
volunteered
to
march
under
so
distinguished
a
leader
he
flew
to
the
succor
of
his
father
repelled
the
invaders
and
drove
them
in
confusion
to
their
vessels
ogier
then
hastened
to
the
capital
but
as
he
drew
near
the
city
he
heard
all
the
bells
sounding
a
knell
he
soon
learned
the
cause
it
was
the
obsequies
of
geoffroy
the
king
ogier
felt
keenly
the
grief
of
not
having
been
permitted
to
embrace
his
father
once
more
and
to
learn
his
latest
commands
but
he
found
that
his
father
had
declared
him
heir
to
his
throne
he
hastened
to
the
church
where
the
body
lay
he
knelt
and
bathed
the
lifeless
form
with
his
tears
at
that
moment
a
celestial
light
beamed
all
around
and
a
voice
of
an
angel
said
ogier
leave
thy
crown
to
guyon
thy
brother
and
bear
no
other
title
than
that
of
dane
thy
destiny
is
glorious
and
other
kingdoms
are
reserved
for
thee
ogier
obeyed
the
divine
behest
he
saluted
his
stepmother
respectfully
and
embracing
his
brother
told
him
that
he
was
content
with
his
lot
in
being
reckoned
among
the
paladins
of
charlemagne
and
resigned
all
claims
to
the
crown
of
denmark
ogier
returned
covered
with
glory
to
the
court
of
charlemagne
and
the
emperor
touched
with
this
proof
of
his
attachment
loaded
him
with
caresses
and
treated
him
almost
as
an
equal
we
pass
in
silence
the
adventures
of
ogier
for
several
ensuing
years
in
which
the
of
his
infancy
showed
their
force
in
making
him
successful
in
all
enterprises
both
of
love
and
war
he
married
the
charming
belicene
and
became
the
father
of
young
baldwin
a
youth
who
seemed
to
inherit
in
full
measure
the
strength
and
courage
of
his
father
and
the
beauty
of
his
mother
when
the
lad
was
old
enough
to
be
separated
from
his
mother
ogier
took
him
to
court
and
presented
him
to
charlemagne
who
embraced
him
and
took
him
into
his
service
it
seemed
to
duke
namo
and
all
the
elder
knights
as
if
they
saw
in
him
ogier
himself
as
he
was
when
a
youth
and
this
resemblance
won
for
the
lad
their
kind
regards
even
charlot
at
first
seemed
to
be
fond
of
him
though
after
a
while
the
resemblance
to
ogier
which
he
noticed
had
the
effect
to
excite
his
hatred
baldwin
was
attentive
to
charlot
and
lost
no
occasion
to
be
serviceable
the
prince
loved
to
play
chess
and
baldwin
who
played
well
often
made
a
party
with
him
one
day
charlot
was
nettled
at
losing
two
pieces
in
succession
he
thought
he
could
by
taking
a
piece
from
baldwin
get
some
amends
for
his
loss
but
baldwin
seeing
him
fall
into
a
trap
which
he
had
set
for
him
could
not
help
a
slight
laugh
as
he
said
charlot
rose
in
a
fury
seized
the
rich
and
heavy
and
dashed
it
with
all
his
strength
on
the
head
of
baldwin
who
fell
and
died
where
he
fell
frightened
at
his
own
crime
and
fearing
the
vengeance
of
the
terrible
ogier
charlot
concealed
himself
in
the
interior
of
the
palace
a
young
companion
of
baldwin
hastened
and
informed
ogier
of
the
event
he
ran
to
the
chamber
and
beheld
the
body
of
his
child
bathed
in
blood
and
it
could
not
be
concealed
from
him
that
charlot
gave
the
blow
transported
with
rage
ogier
sought
charlot
through
the
palace
and
charlot
feeling
safe
nowhere
else
took
refuge
in
the
hall
of
charlemagne
where
he
seated
himself
at
table
with
duke
namo
and
salomon
duke
of
brittany
ogier
with
sword
drawn
followed
him
to
the
very
table
of
the
emperor
when
a
cupbearer
attempted
to
bar
his
way
he
struck
the
cup
from
his
hand
and
dashed
the
contents
in
the
face
charles
rose
in
a
passion
seized
a
knife
and
would
have
plunged
it
into
his
breast
had
not
salomon
and
another
baron
thrown
themselves
between
while
namo
who
had
retained
his
ancient
influence
over
ogier
drew
him
out
of
the
room
foreseeing
the
consequence
of
this
violence
pitying
ogier
and
in
his
heart
excusing
him
namo
hurried
him
away
before
the
guards
of
the
palace
could
arrest
him
made
him
mount
his
horse
and
leave
paris
charlemagne
called
together
his
peers
and
made
them
take
an
oath
to
do
all
in
their
power
to
arrest
ogier
and
bring
him
to
condign
punishment
ogier
on
his
part
sent
messages
to
the
emperor
offering
to
give
himself
up
on
condition
that
charlot
should
be
punished
for
his
atrocious
crime
the
emperor
would
listen
to
no
conditions
and
went
in
pursuit
of
ogier
at
the
head
of
a
large
body
of
soldiers
ogier
on
the
other
hand
was
warmly
supported
by
many
knights
who
pledged
themselves
in
his
defence
the
contest
raged
long
with
no
decisive
results
ogier
more
than
once
had
the
emperor
in
his
power
but
declined
to
avail
himself
of
his
advantage
and
released
him
without
conditions
he
even
implored
pardon
for
himself
but
demanded
at
the
same
time
the
punishment
of
charlot
but
charlemagne
was
too
blindly
fond
of
his
unworthy
son
to
subject
him
to
punishment
for
the
sake
of
conciliating
one
who
had
been
so
deeply
injured
at
length
distressed
at
the
blood
which
his
friends
had
lost
in
his
cause
ogier
dismissed
his
little
army
and
slipping
away
from
those
who
wished
to
attend
him
took
his
course
to
rejoin
the
duke
guyon
his
brother
on
his
way
having
reached
the
forest
of
ardennes
weary
with
long
travel
the
freshness
of
a
retired
valley
tempted
him
to
lie
down
to
take
some
repose
he
unsaddled
beiffror
relieved
himself
of
his
helmet
lay
down
on
the
turf
rested
his
head
on
his
shield
and
slept
it
so
happened
that
turpin
who
occasionally
recalled
to
mind
that
he
was
archbishop
of
rheins
was
at
that
time
in
the
vicinity
making
a
pastoral
visit
to
the
churches
under
his
jurisdiction
but
his
dignity
of
peer
of
france
and
his
martial
spirit
which
caused
him
to
be
reckoned
among
the
preux
chevaliers
of
his
time
forbade
him
to
travel
without
as
large
a
retinue
of
knights
as
he
had
of
clergymen
one
of
these
was
thirsty
and
knowing
the
fountain
on
the
borders
of
which
ogier
was
reposing
he
rode
to
it
and
was
struck
by
the
sight
of
a
knight
stretched
on
the
ground
he
hastened
back
and
let
the
archbishop
know
who
approached
the
fountain
and
recognized
ogier
the
first
impulse
of
the
good
and
generous
turpin
was
to
save
his
friend
for
whom
he
felt
the
warmest
attachment
but
his
archdeacons
and
knights
who
also
recognized
ogier
reminded
the
archbishop
of
the
oath
which
the
emperor
had
exacted
of
them
all
turpin
could
not
be
false
to
his
oath
but
it
was
not
without
a
groan
that
he
permitted
his
followers
to
bind
the
sleeping
knight
the
archbishop
attendants
secured
the
horse
and
arms
of
ogier
and
conducted
their
prisoner
to
the
emperor
at
soissons
the
emperor
had
become
so
much
embittered
by
ogier
obstinate
resistance
added
to
his
original
fault
that
he
was
disposed
to
order
him
to
instant
death
but
turpin
seconded
by
the
good
dukes
namo
and
salomon
prayed
so
hard
for
him
that
charlemagne
consented
to
remit
a
violent
death
but
sentenced
him
to
close
imprisonment
under
the
charge
of
the
archbishop
strictly
limiting
his
food
to
one
quarter
of
a
loaf
of
bread
per
day
with
one
piece
of
meat
and
a
quarter
of
a
cup
of
wine
in
this
way
he
hoped
to
quickly
put
an
end
to
his
life
without
bringing
on
himself
the
hostility
of
the
king
of
denmark
and
other
powerful
friends
of
ogier
he
exacted
a
new
oath
of
turpin
to
obey
his
order
strictly
the
good
archbishop
loved
ogier
too
well
not
to
cast
about
for
some
means
of
saving
his
life
which
he
foresaw
he
would
soon
lose
if
subjected
to
such
scanty
fare
for
ogier
was
seven
feet
tall
and
had
an
appetite
in
proportion
turpin
remembered
moreover
that
ogier
was
a
true
son
of
the
church
always
zealous
to
propagate
the
faith
and
subdue
unbelievers
so
he
felt
justified
in
practising
on
this
occasion
what
in
later
times
has
been
entitled
mental
reservation
without
swerving
from
the
letter
of
the
oath
which
he
had
taken
this
is
the
method
he
hit
upon
every
morning
he
had
his
prisoner
supplied
with
a
quarter
of
a
loaf
of
bread
made
of
two
bushels
of
flour
to
this
he
added
a
quarter
of
a
sheep
or
a
fat
calf
and
he
had
a
cup
made
which
held
forty
pints
of
wine
and
allowed
ogier
a
quarter
of
it
daily
ogier
imprisonment
lasted
long
charlemagne
was
astonished
to
hear
from
time
to
time
that
he
still
held
out
and
when
he
inquired
more
particularly
of
turpin
the
good
archbishop
relying
on
his
own
understanding
of
the
words
did
not
hesitate
to
affirm
positively
that
he
allowed
his
prisoner
no
more
than
the
permitted
ration
we
forgot
to
say
that
when
ogier
was
led
prisoner
to
soissons
the
abbot
of
saint
faron
observing
the
fine
horse
beiffror
and
not
having
at
the
time
any
other
favor
to
ask
of
charlemagne
begged
the
emperor
to
give
him
the
horse
and
had
him
taken
to
his
abbey
he
was
impatient
to
try
his
new
acquisition
and
when
he
had
arrived
in
his
litter
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
where
the
horse
had
been
brought
to
meet
him
mounted
him
and
rode
onward
the
horse
accustomed
to
bear
the
enormous
weight
of
ogier
in
his
armor
when
he
perceived
nothing
on
his
back
but
the
light
weight
of
the
abbot
whose
long
robes
fluttered
against
his
sides
ran
away
making
prodigious
leaps
over
the
steep
acclivities
of
the
mountain
till
he
reached
the
convent
of
jouaire
where
in
sight
of
the
abbess
and
her
nuns
he
threw
the
abbot
already
half
dead
with
fright
to
the
ground
the
abbot
bruised
and
mortified
revenged
himself
on
poor
beiffror
whom
he
condemned
in
his
wrath
to
be
given
to
the
workmen
to
drag
stones
for
a
chapel
that
he
was
building
near
the
abbey
thus
and
often
beaten
the
noble
horse
beiffror
passed
the
time
while
his
master
imprisonment
lasted
that
imprisonment
would
have
been
as
long
as
his
life
if
it
had
not
been
for
some
important
events
which
forced
the
emperor
to
set
ogier
at
liberty
the
emperor
learned
at
the
same
time
that
carahue
king
of
mauritania
was
assembling
an
army
to
come
and
demand
the
liberation
of
ogier
that
guyon
king
of
denmark
was
prepared
to
second
the
enterprise
with
all
his
forces
and
worse
than
all
that
the
saracens
under
bruhier
sultan
of
arabia
had
landed
in
gascony
taken
bordeaux
and
were
marching
with
all
speed
for
paris
charlemagne
now
felt
how
necessary
the
aid
of
ogier
was
to
him
but
in
spite
of
the
representations
of
turpin
namo
and
salomon
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
consent
to
surrender
charlot
to
such
punishment
as
ogier
should
see
fit
to
impose
besides
he
believed
that
ogier
was
without
strength
and
vigor
weakened
by
imprisonment
and
long
abstinence
at
this
crisis
he
received
a
message
from
bruhier
proposing
to
put
the
issue
upon
the
result
of
a
combat
between
himself
and
the
emperor
or
his
champion
promising
if
defeated
to
withdraw
his
army
charlemagne
would
willingly
have
accepted
the
challenge
but
his
counsellors
all
opposed
it
the
herald
was
therefore
told
that
the
emperor
would
take
time
to
consider
his
proposition
and
give
his
answer
the
next
day
it
was
during
this
interval
that
the
three
dukes
succeeded
in
prevailing
upon
charlemagne
to
pardon
ogier
and
to
send
for
him
to
combat
the
puissant
enemy
who
now
defied
him
but
it
was
no
easy
task
to
persuade
ogier
the
idea
of
his
long
imprisonment
and
the
recollection
of
his
son
bleeding
and
dying
in
his
arms
by
the
blow
of
the
ferocious
charlot
made
him
long
resist
the
urgency
of
his
friends
though
glory
called
him
to
encounter
bruhier
and
the
safety
of
christendom
demanded
the
destruction
of
this
proud
enemy
of
the
faith
ogier
only
yielded
at
last
on
condition
that
charlot
should
be
delivered
into
his
hands
to
be
dealt
with
as
he
should
see
fit
the
terms
were
hard
but
the
danger
was
pressing
and
charlemagne
with
a
returning
sense
of
justice
and
a
strong
confidence
in
the
generous
though
passionate
soul
of
ogier
at
last
consented
to
them
ogier
was
led
into
the
presence
of
charlemagne
by
the
three
peers
the
emperor
faithful
to
his
word
had
caused
charlot
to
be
brought
into
the
hall
where
the
high
barons
were
assembled
his
hands
tied
and
his
head
uncovered
when
the
emperor
saw
ogier
approach
he
took
charlot
by
the
arm
led
him
towards
ogier
and
said
these
words
i
surrender
the
criminal
do
with
him
as
you
think
fit
ogier
without
replying
seized
charlot
by
the
hair
forced
him
on
his
knees
and
lifted
with
the
other
hand
his
irresistible
sword
charlemagne
who
expected
to
see
the
head
of
his
son
rolling
at
his
feet
shut
his
eyes
and
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
ogier
had
done
enough
the
next
moment
he
raised
charlot
cut
his
bonds
kissed
him
on
the
mouth
and
hastened
to
throw
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
emperor
nothing
can
exceed
the
surprise
and
joy
of
charlemagne
at
seeing
his
son
unharmed
and
ogier
kneeling
at
his
feet
he
folded
him
in
his
arms
bathed
him
with
tears
and
exclaimed
to
his
barons
i
feel
at
this
moment
that
ogier
is
greater
than
i
as
for
charlot
his
base
soul
felt
nothing
but
the
joy
of
having
escaped
death
he
remained
such
as
he
had
been
and
it
was
not
till
some
years
afterwards
he
received
the
punishment
he
deserved
from
the
hands
of
huon
of
bordeaux
as
we
have
seen
in
a
former
chapter
ogier
the
dane
continued
when
charlemagne
had
somewhat
recovered
his
composure
he
was
surprised
to
observe
that
ogier
appeared
in
good
case
and
had
a
healthy
color
in
his
cheeks
he
turned
to
the
archbishop
who
could
not
help
blushing
as
he
met
his
eye
by
the
head
of
bertha
my
queen
said
charlemagne
ogier
has
had
good
quarters
in
your
castle
my
lord
archbishop
but
so
much
the
more
am
i
indebted
to
you
all
the
barons
laughed
and
jested
with
turpin
who
only
said
laugh
as
much
as
you
please
my
lords
but
for
my
part
i
am
not
sorry
to
see
the
arm
in
full
vigor
that
is
to
avenge
us
on
the
proud
saracen
charlemagne
immediately
despatched
his
herald
accepting
the
challenge
and
appointing
the
next
day
but
one
for
the
encounter
the
proud
and
crafty
bruhier
laughed
scornfully
when
he
heard
the
reply
accepting
his
challenge
for
he
had
a
reliance
on
certain
resources
besides
his
natural
strength
and
skill
however
he
swore
by
mahomet
to
observe
the
conditions
as
proposed
and
agreed
upon
ogier
now
demanded
his
armor
and
it
was
brought
to
him
in
excellent
condition
for
the
good
turpin
had
kept
it
faithfully
but
it
was
not
easy
to
provide
a
horse
for
the
occasion
charlemagne
had
the
best
horses
of
his
stables
brought
out
except
blanchard
his
own
charger
but
all
in
vain
the
weight
of
ogier
bent
their
backs
to
the
ground
in
this
embarrassment
the
archbishop
remembered
that
the
emperor
had
given
beiffror
to
the
abbot
of
faron
and
sent
off
a
courier
in
haste
to
him
monks
are
hard
masters
and
the
one
who
directed
the
laborers
at
the
abbey
had
but
too
faithfully
obeyed
the
orders
of
the
abbot
poor
beiffror
was
brought
back
lean
spiritless
and
chafed
with
the
harness
of
the
vile
cart
that
he
had
had
to
draw
so
long
he
carried
his
head
down
and
trod
heavily
before
charlemagne
but
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
ogier
he
raised
his
head
he
neighed
his
eyes
flashed
his
former
ardor
showed
itself
by
the
force
with
which
he
pawed
the
ground
ogier
caressed
him
and
the
good
steed
seemed
to
return
his
caresses
ogier
mounted
him
and
beiffror
proud
of
carrying
his
master
again
leapt
and
curvetted
with
all
his
youthful
vigor
nothing
being
now
wanted
charlemagne
at
the
head
of
his
army
marched
forth
from
the
city
of
paris
and
occupied
the
hill
of
montmartre
whence
the
view
extended
over
the
plain
of
denis
where
the
battle
was
to
be
fought
when
the
appointed
day
came
the
dukes
namo
and
salomon
as
seconds
of
ogier
accompanied
him
to
the
place
marked
out
for
the
lists
and
bruhier
with
two
distinguished
emirs
presented
himself
on
the
other
side
bruhier
was
in
high
spirits
and
jested
with
his
friends
as
he
advanced
upon
the
appearance
of
beiffror
is
that
the
horse
they
presume
to
match
with
marchevallee
the
best
steed
that
ever
fed
in
the
vales
of
mount
atlas
but
now
the
combatants
having
met
and
saluted
each
other
ride
apart
to
come
together
in
full
career
beiffror
flew
over
the
plain
and
met
the
adversary
more
than
the
lances
of
the
two
combatants
were
shivered
at
the
shock
and
bruhier
was
astonished
to
see
almost
at
the
same
instant
the
sword
of
ogier
gleaming
above
his
head
he
parried
it
with
his
buckler
and
gave
ogier
a
blow
on
his
helmet
who
returned
it
with
another
better
aimed
or
better
seconded
by
the
temper
of
his
blade
for
it
cut
away
part
of
bruhier
helmet
and
with
it
his
ear
and
part
of
his
cheek
ogier
seeing
the
blood
did
not
immediately
repeat
his
blow
and
bruhier
seized
the
moment
to
gallop
off
at
one
side
as
he
rode
he
took
a
vase
of
gold
which
hung
at
his
and
bathed
with
its
contents
the
wounded
part
the
blood
instantly
ceased
to
flow
the
ear
and
the
flesh
were
restored
quite
whole
and
the
dane
was
astonished
to
see
his
antagonist
return
to
the
ground
as
sound
as
ever
bruhier
laughed
at
his
amazement
know
said
he
that
i
possess
the
precious
balm
that
joseph
of
arimathea
used
upon
the
body
of
the
crucified
one
whom
you
worship
if
i
should
lose
an
arm
i
could
restore
it
with
a
few
drops
of
this
it
is
useless
for
you
to
contend
with
me
yield
yourself
and
as
you
appear
to
be
a
strong
fellow
i
will
make
you
first
oarsman
in
one
of
my
galleys
ogier
though
boiling
with
rage
forgot
not
to
implore
the
assistance
of
heaven
o
lord
he
exclaimed
suffer
not
the
enemy
of
thy
name
to
profit
by
the
powerful
help
of
that
which
owes
all
its
virtue
to
thy
divine
blood
at
these
words
he
attacked
bruhier
again
with
more
vigor
than
ever
both
struck
terrible
blows
and
made
grievous
wounds
but
the
blood
flowed
from
those
of
ogier
while
bruhier
stanched
his
by
the
application
of
his
balm
ogier
desperate
at
the
unequal
contest
grasped
cortana
with
both
hands
and
struck
his
enemy
such
a
blow
that
it
cleft
his
buckler
and
cut
off
his
arm
with
it
but
bruhier
at
the
same
time
launched
one
at
ogier
which
missing
him
struck
the
head
of
beiffror
and
the
good
horse
fell
and
drew
down
his
master
in
his
fall
bruhier
had
time
to
leap
to
the
ground
to
pick
up
his
arm
and
apply
his
balsam
then
before
ogier
had
recovered
his
footing
he
rushed
forward
with
sword
uplifted
to
complete
his
destruction
charlemagne
from
the
height
of
montmartre
seeing
the
brave
ogier
in
this
situation
groaned
and
was
ready
to
murmur
against
providence
but
the
good
turpin
raising
his
arms
with
a
faith
like
that
of
moses
drew
down
upon
the
christian
warrior
the
favor
of
heaven
ogier
promptly
disengaging
himself
pressed
bruhier
with
so
much
impetuosity
that
he
drove
him
to
a
distance
from
his
horse
to
whose
the
precious
balm
was
suspended
and
very
soon
charlemagne
saw
ogier
now
completely
in
the
advantage
bring
his
enemy
to
his
knees
tear
off
his
helmet
and
with
a
sweep
of
his
sword
strike
his
head
from
his
body
after
the
victory
ogier
seized
marchevallee
leaped
upon
his
back
and
became
possessed
of
the
precious
flask
a
few
drops
from
which
closed
his
wounds
and
restored
his
strength
the
french
knights
who
had
been
bruhier
captives
now
released
pressed
round
ogier
to
thank
him
for
their
deliverance
charlemagne
and
his
nobles
as
soon
as
their
attention
was
relieved
from
the
single
combat
perceived
from
their
elevated
position
an
unusual
agitation
in
the
enemy
camp
they
attributed
it
at
first
to
the
death
of
their
general
but
soon
the
noise
of
arms
the
cries
of
combatants
and
new
standards
which
advanced
disclosed
to
them
the
fact
that
bruhier
army
was
attacked
by
a
new
enemy
the
emperor
was
right
it
was
the
brave
carahue
of
mauritania
who
with
an
army
had
arrived
in
france
resolved
to
attempt
the
liberation
of
ogier
his
brother
in
arms
learning
on
his
arrival
the
changed
aspect
of
affairs
he
hesitated
not
to
render
a
signal
service
to
the
emperor
by
attacking
the
army
of
bruhier
in
the
midst
of
the
consternation
occasioned
by
the
loss
of
its
commander
ogier
recognized
the
standard
of
his
friend
and
leaping
upon
marchevallee
flew
to
aid
his
attack
charlemagne
followed
with
his
army
and
the
saracen
host
after
an
obstinate
conflict
was
forced
to
surrender
unconditionally
the
interview
of
ogier
and
carahue
was
such
as
might
be
anticipated
of
two
such
attached
friends
and
accomplished
knights
charlemagne
went
to
meet
them
embraced
them
and
putting
the
king
of
mauritania
on
his
right
and
ogier
on
his
left
returned
with
triumph
to
paris
there
the
empress
bertha
and
the
ladies
of
her
court
crowned
them
with
laurels
and
the
sage
and
gallant
eginhard
chamberlain
and
secretary
of
the
emperor
wrote
all
these
great
events
in
his
history
a
few
days
after
guyon
king
of
denmark
arrived
in
france
with
a
chosen
band
of
knights
and
sent
an
ambassador
to
charlemagne
to
say
that
he
came
not
as
an
enemy
but
to
render
homage
to
him
as
the
best
knight
of
the
time
and
the
head
of
the
christian
world
charlemagne
gave
the
ambassador
a
cordial
reception
and
mounting
his
horse
rode
forward
to
meet
the
king
of
denmark
these
great
princes
being
assembled
at
the
court
of
charles
held
council
together
and
the
ancient
and
sage
barons
were
called
to
join
it
it
was
decided
that
the
united
danish
and
mauritanian
armies
should
cross
the
sea
and
carry
the
war
to
the
country
of
the
saracens
and
that
a
thousand
french
knights
should
range
themselves
under
the
banner
of
ogier
the
dane
who
though
not
a
king
should
have
equal
rank
with
the
two
others
we
have
not
space
to
record
all
the
illustrious
actions
performed
by
ogier
and
his
allies
in
this
war
suffice
it
to
say
they
subdued
the
saracens
of
ptolemais
and
judaea
and
erecting
those
regions
into
a
kingdom
placed
the
crown
upon
the
head
of
ogier
guyon
and
carahue
then
left
him
to
return
to
their
respective
dominions
ogier
adopted
walter
the
son
of
guyon
of
denmark
to
be
his
successor
in
his
kingdom
he
superintended
his
education
and
saw
the
young
prince
grow
up
worthy
of
his
cares
but
ogier
in
spite
of
all
the
honors
of
his
rank
often
regretted
the
court
of
charlemagne
the
duke
namo
and
salomon
of
brittany
for
whom
he
had
the
respect
and
attachment
of
a
son
at
last
finding
walter
old
enough
to
sustain
the
weight
of
government
ogier
caused
a
vessel
to
be
prepared
secretly
and
attended
only
by
one
squire
left
his
palace
by
night
and
embarked
to
return
to
france
the
vessel
driven
by
a
fair
wind
cut
the
sea
with
the
swiftness
of
a
bird
but
on
a
sudden
it
deviated
from
its
course
no
longer
obeyed
the
helm
and
sped
fast
towards
a
black
promontory
which
stretched
into
the
sea
this
was
a
mountain
of
loadstone
and
its
attractive
power
increasing
as
the
distance
diminished
the
vessel
at
last
flew
with
the
swiftness
of
an
arrow
towards
it
and
was
dashed
to
pieces
on
its
rocky
base
ogier
alone
saved
himself
and
reached
the
shore
on
a
fragment
of
the
wreck
ogier
advanced
into
the
country
looking
for
some
marks
of
inhabitancy
but
found
none
on
a
sudden
he
encountered
two
monstrous
animals
covered
with
glittering
scales
accompanied
by
a
horse
breathing
fire
ogier
drew
his
sword
and
prepared
to
defend
himself
but
the
monsters
terrific
as
they
appeared
made
no
attempt
to
assail
him
and
the
horse
papillon
knelt
down
and
appeared
to
court
ogier
to
mount
upon
his
back
ogier
hesitated
not
to
see
the
adventure
through
he
mounted
papillon
who
ran
with
speed
and
soon
cleared
the
rocks
and
precipices
which
hemmed
in
and
concealed
a
beautiful
landscape
he
continued
his
course
till
he
reached
a
magnificent
palace
and
without
allowing
ogier
time
to
admire
it
crossed
a
grand
adorned
with
colonnades
and
entered
a
garden
where
making
his
way
through
alleys
of
myrtle
he
checked
his
course
and
knelt
down
on
the
enamelled
turf
of
a
fountain
ogier
dismounted
and
took
some
steps
along
the
margin
of
the
stream
but
was
soon
stopped
by
meeting
a
young
beauty
such
as
they
paint
the
graces
and
almost
as
lightly
attired
as
they
at
the
same
moment
to
his
amazement
his
armor
fell
off
of
its
own
accord
the
young
beauty
advanced
with
a
tender
air
and
placed
upon
his
head
a
crown
of
flowers
at
that
instant
the
danish
hero
lost
his
memory
his
combats
his
glory
charlemagne
and
his
court
all
vanished
from
his
mind
he
saw
only
morgana
he
desired
nothing
but
to
sigh
forever
at
her
feet
we
abridge
the
narrative
of
all
the
delights
which
ogier
enjoyed
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
time
flew
by
leaving
no
impression
of
its
flight
morgana
youthful
charms
did
not
decay
and
ogier
had
none
of
those
warnings
of
increasing
years
which
less
favored
mortals
never
fail
to
receive
there
is
no
knowing
how
long
this
blissful
state
might
have
lasted
if
it
had
not
been
for
an
accident
by
which
morgana
one
day
in
a
sportive
moment
snatched
the
crown
from
his
head
that
moment
ogier
regained
his
memory
and
lost
his
contentment
the
recollection
of
charlemagne
and
of
his
own
relatives
and
friends
saddened
the
hours
which
he
passed
with
morgana
the
fairy
saw
with
grief
the
changed
looks
of
her
lover
at
last
she
drew
from
him
the
acknowledgment
that
he
wished
to
go
at
least
for
a
time
to
revisit
charles
court
she
consented
with
reluctance
and
with
her
own
hands
helped
to
reinvest
him
with
his
armor
papillon
was
led
forth
ogier
mounted
him
and
taking
a
tender
adieu
of
the
tearful
morgana
crossed
at
rapid
speed
the
rocky
belt
which
separated
morgana
palace
from
the
borders
of
the
sea
the
which
had
received
him
at
his
coming
awaited
him
on
the
shore
one
of
them
took
ogier
on
his
back
and
the
other
placing
himself
under
papillon
they
spread
their
broad
fins
and
in
a
short
time
traversed
the
wide
space
that
separates
the
isle
of
avalon
from
france
they
landed
ogier
on
the
coast
of
languedoc
and
then
plunged
into
the
sea
and
disappeared
ogier
remounted
on
papillon
who
carried
him
across
the
kingdom
almost
as
fast
as
he
had
passed
the
sea
he
arrived
under
the
walls
of
paris
which
he
would
scarcely
have
recognized
if
the
high
towers
of
genevieve
had
not
caught
his
eye
he
went
straight
to
the
palace
of
charlemagne
which
seemed
to
him
to
have
been
entirely
rebuilt
his
surprise
was
extreme
and
increased
still
more
on
finding
that
he
understood
with
difficulty
the
language
of
the
guards
and
attendants
in
replying
to
his
questions
and
seeing
them
smile
as
they
tried
to
explain
to
one
another
the
language
in
which
he
addressed
them
presently
the
attention
of
some
of
the
barons
who
were
going
to
court
was
attracted
to
the
scene
and
ogier
who
recognized
the
badges
of
their
rank
addressed
them
and
inquired
if
the
dukes
namo
and
salomon
were
still
residing
at
the
emperor
court
at
this
question
the
barons
looked
at
one
another
in
amazement
and
one
of
the
eldest
said
to
the
rest
how
much
this
knight
resembles
the
portrait
of
my
ogier
the
dane
ah
my
dear
nephew

the

said
he
and
he
remembered
that
morgana
had
told
him
that
he
was
little
aware
of
the
flight
of
time
during
his
abode
with
her
the
barons
more
astonished
than
ever
concluded
to
conduct
him
to
the
monarch
who
then
reigned
the
great
hugh
capet
the
brave
ogier
entered
the
palace
without
hesitation
but
when
on
reaching
the
royal
hall
the
barons
directed
him
to
make
his
obeisance
to
the
king
of
france
he
was
astonished
to
see
a
man
of
short
stature
and
large
head
whose
air
nevertheless
was
noble
and
martial
seated
upon
the
throne
on
which
he
had
so
often
seen
charlemagne
the
tallest
and
handsomest
sovereign
of
his
time
ogier
recounted
his
adventures
with
simplicity
and
affectedness
hugh
capet
was
slow
to
believe
him
but
ogier
recalled
so
many
proofs
and
circumstances
that
at
last
he
was
forced
to
recognize
the
aged
warrior
to
be
the
famous
ogier
the
dane
the
king
informed
ogier
of
the
events
which
had
taken
place
during
his
long
absence
that
the
line
of
charlemagne
was
extinct
that
a
new
dynasty
had
commenced
that
the
old
enemies
of
the
kingdom
the
saracens
were
still
troublesome
and
that
at
that
very
time
an
army
of
those
miscreants
was
besieging
the
city
of
chartres
to
which
he
was
about
to
repair
in
a
few
days
to
its
relief
ogier
always
inflamed
with
the
love
of
glory
offered
the
service
of
his
arm
which
the
illustrious
monarch
accepted
graciously
and
conducted
him
to
the
queen
the
astonishment
of
ogier
was
redoubled
when
he
saw
the
new
ornaments
and
of
the
ladies
still
the
beautiful
hair
which
they
built
up
on
their
foreheads
and
the
feathers
interwoven
which
waved
with
so
much
grace
gave
them
a
noble
air
that
delighted
him
his
admiration
increased
when
instead
of
the
old
empress
bertha
he
saw
a
young
queen
who
combined
a
majestic
mien
with
the
graces
of
her
time
of
life
and
manners
candid
and
charming
suited
to
attach
all
hearts
ogier
saluted
the
youthful
queen
with
a
respect
so
profound
that
many
of
the
courtiers
took
him
for
a
foreigner
or
at
least
for
some
nobleman
brought
up
at
a
distance
from
paris
who
retained
the
manners
of
what
they
called
the
old
court
when
the
queen
was
informed
by
her
husband
that
it
was
the
celebrated
ogier
the
dane
whom
he
presented
to
her
whose
memorable
exploits
she
had
often
read
in
the
chronicles
of
antiquity
her
surprise
was
extreme
which
was
increased
when
she
remarked
the
dignity
of
his
address
the
animation
and
even
the
youthfulness
of
his
countenance
this
queen
had
too
much
intelligence
to
believe
hastily
proof
alone
could
compel
her
assent
and
she
asked
him
many
questions
about
the
old
court
of
charlemagne
and
received
such
instructive
and
appropriate
answers
as
removed
every
doubt
it
is
to
the
corrections
which
ogier
was
at
that
time
enabled
to
make
to
the
popular
narratives
of
his
exploits
that
we
are
indebted
for
the
perfect
accuracy
and
trustworthiness
of
all
the
details
of
our
own
history
king

evening

from
the
inhabitants
of
chartres
informing
him
that
they
were
hard
pressed
by
the
besiegers
resolved
to
hasten
with
ogier
to
their
relief
ogier
terminated
this
affair
as
expeditiously
as
he
had
so
often
done

the
saracens

dared
to
offer
battle

honors
due
to
his
valor
ogier
continued
some
time
at
the
court
detained
by
the
favor
of
the
king
and
queen
but
erelong
he
had
the
pain
to
witness
the
death
of
the
king
then
it
was
that
impressed
with
all
the
perfections
which
he
had
discerned
in
the
queen
he
could
not
withhold
the
tender
homage
of
the
offer
of
his
hand
the
queen
would
perhaps
have
accepted
it
she
had
even
called
a
meeting
of
her
great
barons
to
deliberate
on
the
proposition
when
the
day
before
the
meeting
was
to
be
held
at
the
moment
when
ogier
was
kneeling
at
her
feet
she
perceived
a
crown
of
gold
which
an
invisible
hand
had
placed
on
his
brow
and
in
an
instant
a
cloud
enveloped
ogier
and
he
disappeared
forever
from
her
sight
it
was
morgana
the
fairy
whose
jealousy
was
awakened
at
what
she
beheld
who
now
resumed
her
power
and
took
him
away
to
dwell
with
her
in
the
island
of
avalon
there
in
company
with
the
great
king
arthur
of
britain
he
still
lives
and
when
his
illustrious
friend
shall
return
to
resume

ancient
reign
he
will
doubtless
return
with
him
and

his
triumph
