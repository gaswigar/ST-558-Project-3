my
foremost
design
in
writing
this
preface
is
to
address
a
word
of
exhortation
to
the
society
for
promoting
christian
knowledge
in
the
essay
which
follows
the
reader
will
often
find
bishop
wilson
quoted
to
me
and
to
the
members
of
the
society
for
promoting
christian
knowledge
his
name
and
writings
are
still
no
doubt
familiar
but
the
world
is
fast
going
away
from
people
of
his
sort
and
i
learnt
with
consternation
lately
from
a
brilliant
and
distinguished
votary
of
the
natural
sciences
that
he
had
never
so
much
as
heard
of
bishop
wilson
and
that
he
imagined
me
to
have
invented
him
at
a
moment
when
the
courts
of
law
have
just
taken
off
the
embargo
from
the
recreative
religion
furnished
on
sundays
by
my
gifted
acquaintance
and
others
and
when
martin
hall
iv
and
the
alhambra
will
soon
be
beginning
again
to
resound
with
their
it
distresses
one
to
think
that
the
new
lights
should
not
only
have
in
general
a
very
low
opinion
of
the
preachers
of
the
old
religion
but
that
they
should
have
it
without
knowing
the
best
that
these
preachers
can
do
and
that
they
are
in
this
case
is
owing
in
part
certainly
to
the
negligence
of
the
christian
knowledge
society
in
old
times
they
used
to
print
and
spread
abroad
bishop
wilson
maxims
of
piety
and
christianity
the
copy
of
this
work
which
i
use
is
one
of
their
publications
bearing
their
imprint
and
bound
in
the
brown
calf
which
they
made
familiar
to
our
childhood
but
the
date
of
my
copy
is
i
know
of
no
copy
besides
and
i
believe
the
work
is
no
longer
one
of
those
printed
and
circulated
by
the
society
hence
the
error
flattering
i
own
to
me
personally
yet
in
itself
to
be
regretted
of
the
distinguished
physicist
already
mentioned
but
bishop
wilson
maxims
deserve
to
be
circulated
as
a
religious
book
not
only
by
comparison
with
the
cartloads
of
rubbish
circulated
at
present
under
this
designation
but
for
their
own
sake
and
even
by
comparison
with
the
other
works
of
the
same
v
author
over
the
far
better
known
sacra
privata
they
have
this
advantage
that
they
were
prepared
by
him
for
his
own
private
use
while
the
sacra
privata
were
prepared
by
him
for
the
use
of
the
public
the
maxims
were
never
meant
to
be
printed
and
have
on
that
account
like
a
work
of
doubtless
far
deeper
emotion
and
power
the
meditations
of
marcus
aurelius
something
peculiarly
sincere
and
about
them
some
of
the
best
things
from
the
maxims
have
passed
into
the
sacra
privata
still
in
the
maxims
we
have
them
as
they
first
arose
and
whereas
too
in
the
sacra
privata
the
writer
speaks
very
often
as
one
of
the
clergy
and
as
addressing
the
clergy
in
the
maxims
he
almost
always
speaks
solely
as
a
man
i
am
not
saying
a
word
against
the
sacra
privata
for
which
i
have
the
highest
respect
only
the
maxims
seem
to
me
a
better
and
a
more
edifying
book
still
they
should
be
read
as
joubert
says
nicole
should
be
read
with
a
direct
aim
at
practice
the
reader
will
leave
on
one
side
things
which
from
the
change
of
time
and
from
the
changed
point
of
view
which
the
change
of
time
inevitably
brings
with
it
no
longer
suit
him
enough
vi
will
remain
to
serve
as
a
sample
of
the
very
best
perhaps
which
our
nation
and
race
can
do
in
the
way
of
religious
writing
monsieur
michelet
makes
it
a
reproach
to
us
that
in
all
the
doubt
as
to
the
real
author
of
the
imitation
no
one
has
ever
dreamed
of
ascribing
that
work
to
an
englishman
it
is
true
the
imitation
could
not
well
have
been
written
by
an
englishman
the
religious
delicacy
and
the
profound
asceticism
of
that
admirable
book
are
hardly
in
our
nature
this
would
be
more
of
a
reproach
to
us
if
in
poetry
which
requires
no
less
than
religion
a
true
delicacy
of
spiritual
perception
our
race
had
not
done
such
great
things
and
if
the
imitation
exquisite
as
it
is
did
not
as
i
have
elsewhere
remarked
belong
to
a
class
of
works
in
which
the
perfect
balance
of
human
nature
is
lost
and
which
have
therefore
as
spiritual
productions
in
their
contents
something
excessive
and
morbid
in
their
form
something
not
thoroughly
sound
on
a
lower
range
than
the
imitation
and
awakening
in
our
nature
chords
less
poetical
and
delicate
the
maxims
of
bishop
wilson
are
as
a
religious
work
far
more
solid
to
the
most
sincere
ardour
and
unction
bishop
wilson
unites
in
these
maxims
that
downright
honesty
vii
and
plain
good
sense
which
our
english
race
has
so
powerfully
applied
to
the
divine
impossibilities
of
religion
by
which
it
has
brought
religion
so
much
into
practical
life
and
has
done
its
allotted
part
in
promoting
upon
earth
the
kingdom
of
god
but
with
ardour
and
unction
religion
as
we
all
know
may
still
be
fanatical
with
honesty
and
good
sense
it
may
still
be
prosaic
and
the
fruit
of
honesty
and
good
sense
united
with
ardour
and
unction
is
often
only
a
prosaic
religion
held
fanatically
bishop
wilson
excellence
lies
in
a
balance
of
the
four
qualities
and
in
a
fulness
and
perfection
of
them
which
makes
this
untoward
result
impossible
his
unction
is
so
perfect
and
in
such
happy
alliance
with
his
good
sense
that
it
becomes
tenderness
and
fervent
charity
his
good
sense
is
so
perfect
and
in
such
happy
alliance
with
his
unction
that
it
becomes
moderation
and
insight
while
therefore
the
type
of
religion
exhibited
in
his
maxims
is
english
it
is
yet
a
type
of
a
far
higher
kind
than
is
in
general
reached
by
bishop
wilson
countrymen
and
yet
being
english
it
is
possible
and
attainable
for
them
and
so
i
conclude
as
i
began
by
saying
that
a
work
of
this
sort
is
one
which
the
society
for
promoting
christian
viii
knowledge
should
not
suffer
to
remain
out
of
print
or
out
of
currency
to
pass
now
to
the
matters
canvassed
in
the
following
essay
the
whole
scope
of
the
essay
is
to
recommend
culture
as
the
great
help
out
of
our
present
difficulties
culture
being
a
pursuit
of
our
total
perfection
by
means
of
getting
to
know
on
all
the
matters
which
most
concern
us
the
best
which
has
been
thought
and
said
in
the
world
and
through
this
knowledge
turning
a
stream
of
fresh
and
free
thought
upon
our
stock
notions
and
habits
which
we
now
follow
staunchly
but
mechanically
vainly
imagining
that
there
is
a
virtue
in
following
them
staunchly
which
makes
up
for
the
mischief
of
following
them
mechanically
this
and
this
alone
is
the
scope
of
the
following
essay
i
say
again
here
what
i
have
said
in
the
pages
which
follow
that
from
the
faults
and
weaknesses
of
bookmen
a
notion
of
something
bookish
pedantic
and
futile
has
got
itself
more
or
less
connected
with
the
word
culture
and
that
it
is
a
pity
we
can
not
use
a
word
more
perfectly
free
from
all
shadow
of
reproach
and
yet
futile
as
are
many
bookmen
and
helpless
as
books
and
reading
often
prove
for
bringing
nearer
to
perfection
those
who
ix
use
them
one
must
i
think
be
struck
more
and
more
the
longer
one
lives
to
find
how
much
in
our
present
society
a
man
life
of
each
day
depends
for
its
solidity
and
value
on
whether
he
reads
during
that
day
and
far
more
still
on
what
he
reads
during
it
more
and
more
he
who
examines
himself
will
find
the
difference
it
makes
to
him
at
the
end
of
any
given
day
whether
or
no
he
has
pursued
his
avocations
throughout
it
without
reading
at
all
and
whether
or
no
having
read
something
he
has
read
the
newspapers
only
this
however
is
a
matter
for
each
man
private
conscience
and
experience
if
a
man
without
books
or
reading
or
reading
nothing
but
his
letters
and
the
newspapers
gets
nevertheless
a
fresh
and
free
play
of
the
best
thoughts
upon
his
stock
notions
and
habits
he
has
got
culture
he
has
got
that
for
which
we
prize
and
recommend
culture
he
has
got
that
which
at
the
present
moment
we
seek
culture
that
it
may
give
us
this
inward
operation
is
the
very
life
and
essence
of
culture
as
we
conceive
it
nevertheless
it
is
not
easy
so
to
frame
one
discourse
concerning
the
operation
of
culture
as
to
avoid
giving
frequent
occasion
to
a
misunderstanding
whereby
the
essential
inwardness
of
the
x
operation
is
lost
sight
of
we
are
supposed
when
we
criticise
by
the
help
of
culture
some
imperfect
doing
or
other
to
have
in
our
eye
some
rival
plan
of
doing
which
we
want
to
serve
and
recommend
thus
for
instance
because
i
have
freely
pointed
out
the
dangers
and
inconveniences
to
which
our
literature
is
exposed
in
the
absence
of
any
centre
of
taste
and
authority
like
the
french
academy
it
is
constantly
said
that
i
want
to
introduce
here
in
england
an
institution
like
the
french
academy
i
have
indeed
expressly
declared
that
i
wanted
no
such
thing
but
let
us
notice
how
it
is
just
our
worship
of
machinery
and
of
external
doing
which
leads
to
this
charge
being
brought
and
how
the
inwardness
of
culture
makes
us
seize
for
watching
and
cure
the
faults
to
which
our
want
of
an
academy
inclines
us
and
yet
prevents
us
from
trusting
to
an
arm
of
flesh
as
the
puritans
say
from
blindly
flying
to
this
outward
machinery
of
an
academy
in
order
to
help
ourselves
for
the
very
same
culture
and
free
inward
play
of
thought
which
shows
us
how
the
corinthian
style
or
the
whimsies
about
the
one
primeval
language
are
generated
and
strengthened
in
the
absence
of
an
xi
academy
shows
us
too
how
little
any
academy
such
as
we
should
be
likely
to
get
would
cure
them
every
one
who
knows
the
characteristics
of
our
national
life
and
the
tendencies
so
fully
discussed
in
the
following
pages
knows
exactly
what
an
english
academy
would
be
like
one
can
see
the
happy
family
in
one
mind
eye
as
distinctly
as
if
it
was
already
constituted
lord
stanhope
the
bishop
of
oxford
gladstone
the
dean
of
westminster
froude
henry
reeve
everything
which
is
influential
accomplished
and
distinguished
and
then
some
fine
morning
a
dissatisfaction
of
the
public
mind
with
this
brilliant
and
select
coterie
a
flight
of
corinthian
leading
articles
and
an
irruption
of
sala
clearly
this
is
not
what
will
do
us
good
the
very
same
faults
the
want
of
sensitiveness
of
intellectual
conscience
the
disbelief
in
right
reason
the
dislike
of
authority
which
have
hindered
our
having
an
academy
and
have
worked
injuriously
in
our
literature
would
also
hinder
us
from
making
our
academy
if
we
established
it
one
which
would
really
correct
them
and
culture
which
shows
us
truly
the
faults
shows
us
this
also
just
as
truly
xii
it
is
by
a
like
sort
of
misunderstanding
again
that
oscar
browning
one
of
the
at
eton
takes
up
in
the
quarterly
review
the
cudgels
for
eton
as
if
i
had
attacked
eton
because
i
have
said
in
a
book
about
foreign
schools
that
a
man
may
well
prefer
to
teach
his
three
or
four
hours
a
day
without
keeping
a
and
that
there
are
great
dangers
in
cramming
little
boys
of
eight
or
ten
and
making
them
compete
for
an
object
of
great
value
to
their
parents
and
again
that
the
manufacture
and
supply
of
in
england
much
needs
regulation
by
some
competent
authority
oscar
browning
gives
us
to
understand
that
at
eton
he
and
others
with
perfect
satisfaction
to
themselves
and
the
public
combine
the
functions
of
teaching
and
of
keeping
a
that
he
knows
excellent
men
and
indeed
well
he
may
for
a
brother
of
his
own
i
am
told
is
one
of
the
best
of
them
engaged
in
preparing
little
boys
for
competitive
examinations
and
that
the
result
as
tested
at
eton
gives
perfect
satisfaction
and
as
to
he
adds
finally
that
william
smith
the
learned
and
distinguished
editor
of
the
quarterly
review
is
as
we
all
know
xiii
the
compiler
of
meritorious
and
many
this
is
what
oscar
browning
gives
us
to
understand
in
the
quarterly
review
and
it
is
impossible
not
to
read
with
pleasure
what
he
says
for
what
can
give
a
finer
example
of
that
frankness
and
manly
confidence
which
our
great
public
schools
and
none
of
them
so
much
as
eton
are
supposed
to
inspire
of
that
buoyant
ease
in
holding
up
one
head
speaking
out
what
is
in
one
mind
and
flinging
off
all
sheepishness
and
awkwardness
than
to
see
an
eton
offering
in
fact
himself
as
evidence
that
to
combine
keeping
with
teaching
is
a
good
thing
and
his
brother
as
evidence
that
to
train
and
race
little
boys
for
competitive
examinations
is
a
good
thing
nay
and
one
sees
that
this
eton
confidence
is
contagious
for
has
not
oscar
browning
managed
to
fire
william
smith
himself
no
doubt
the
modestest
man
alive
and
never
trained
at
eton
with
the
same
spirit
and
made
him
insert
in
his
own
review
a
puff
so
to
speak
of
his
own
declaring
that
they
are
as
they
are
meritorious
and
many
nevertheless
oscar
browning
is
wrong
in
xiv
thinking
that
i
wished
to
run
down
eton
and
his
repetition
on
behalf
of
eton
with
this
idea
in
his
head
of
the
strains
of
his
heroic
ancestor
malvina
oscar
as
they
are
recorded
by
the
family
poet
ossian
is
unnecessary
the
wild
boar
rushes
over
their
tombs
but
he
does
not
disturb
their
repose
they
still
love
the
sport
of
their
youth
and
mount
the
wind
with
joy
all
i
meant
to
say
was
that
there
were
unpleasantnesses
in
uniting
the
keeping
a
with
teaching
and
dangers
in
cramming
and
racing
little
boys
for
competitive
examinations
and
charlatanism
and
extravagance
in
the
manufacture
and
supply
of
our
but
when
oscar
browning
tells
us
that
all
these
have
been
happily
got
rid
of
in
his
case
and
his
brother
case
and
william
smith
case
then
i
say
that
this
is
just
what
i
wish
and
i
hope
other
people
will
follow
their
good
example
all
i
seek
is
that
such
blemishes
should
not
through
any
negligence
or
want
of
due
examination
be
suffered
to
continue
natural
as
we
have
said
the
sort
of
misunderstanding
just
noticed
is
yet
our
usefulness
depends
upon
our
being
able
to
clear
it
away
and
to
convince
xv
those
who
mechanically
serve
some
stock
notion
or
operation
and
thereby
go
astray
that
it
is
not
culture
work
or
aim
to
give
the
victory
to
some
rival
fetish
but
simply
to
turn
a
free
and
fresh
stream
of
thought
upon
the
whole
matter
in
question
in
a
thing
of
more
immediate
interest
just
now
than
either
of
the
two
we
have
mentioned
the
like
misunderstanding
prevails
and
until
it
is
dissipated
culture
can
do
no
good
work
in
the
matter
when
we
criticise
the
present
operation
of
disestablishing
the
irish
church
not
by
the
power
of
reason
and
justice
but
by
the
power
of
the
antipathy
of
the
protestant
nonconformists
english
and
scotch
to
establishments
we
are
charged
with
being
dreamers
of
dreams
which
the
national
will
has
rudely
shattered
for
endowing
the
religious
sects
all
round
or
we
are
called
enemies
of
the
nonconformists
blind
partisans
of
the
anglican
establishment
more
than
a
few
words
we
must
give
to
showing
how
erroneous
are
these
charges
because
if
they
were
true
we
should
be
actually
subverting
our
own
design
and
playing
false
to
that
culture
which
it
is
our
very
purpose
to
recommend
certainly
we
are
no
enemies
of
the
nonconformists
xvi
for
on
the
contrary
what
we
aim
at
is
their
perfection
culture
which
is
the
study
of
perfection
leads
us
as
we
in
the
following
pages
have
shown
to
conceive
of
true
human
perfection
as
a
harmonious
perfection
developing
all
sides
of
our
humanity
and
as
a
general
perfection
developing
all
parts
of
our
society
for
if
one
member
suffer
the
other
members
must
suffer
with
it
and
the
fewer
there
are
that
follow
the
true
way
of
salvation
the
harder
that
way
is
to
find
and
while
the
nonconformists
the
successors
and
representatives
of
the
puritans
and
like
them
staunchly
walking
by
the
best
light
they
have
make
a
large
part
of
what
is
strongest
and
most
serious
in
this
nation
and
therefore
attract
our
respect
and
interest
yet
all
that
in
what
follows
is
said
about
hebraism
and
hellenism
has
for
its
main
result
to
show
how
our
puritans
ancient
and
modern
have
not
enough
added
to
their
care
for
walking
staunchly
by
the
best
light
they
have
a
care
that
that
light
be
not
darkness
how
they
have
developed
one
side
of
their
humanity
at
the
expense
of
all
others
and
have
become
incomplete
and
mutilated
men
in
consequence
thus
falling
short
of
harmonious
xvii
perfection
they
fail
to
follow
the
true
way
of
salvation
therefore
that
way
is
made
the
harder
for
others
to
find
general
perfection
is
put
further
off
out
of
our
reach
and
the
confusion
and
perplexity
in
which
our
society
now
labours
is
increased
by
the
nonconformists
rather
than
diminished
by
them
so
while
we
praise
and
esteem
the
zeal
of
the
nonconformists
in
walking
staunchly
by
the
best
light
they
have
and
desire
to
take
no
whit
from
it
we
seek
to
add
to
this
what
we
call
sweetness
and
light
and
develope
their
full
humanity
more
perfectly
and
to
seek
this
is
certainly
not
to
be
the
enemy
of
the
nonconformists
but
now
with
these
ideas
in
our
head
we
come
across
the
present
operation
for
disestablishing
the
irish
church
by
the
power
of
the
nonconformists
antipathy
to
religious
establishments
and
endowments
and
we
see
liberal
statesmen
for
whose
purpose
this
antipathy
happens
to
be
convenient
flattering
it
all
they
can
saying
that
though
they
have
no
intention
of
laying
hands
on
an
establishment
which
is
efficient
and
popular
like
the
anglican
establishment
here
in
england
yet
it
is
in
the
abstract
a
fine
and
good
thing
that
religion
should
xviii
be
left
to
the
voluntary
support
of
its
promoters
and
should
thus
gain
in
energy
and
independence
and
gladstone
has
no
words
strong
enough
to
express
his
admiration
of
the
refusal
of
by
the
irish
roman
catholics
who
have
never
yet
been
seriously
asked
to
accept
it
but
who
would
a
good
deal
embarrass
him
if
they
demanded
it
and
we
see
philosophical
politicians
with
a
turn
for
swimming
with
the
stream
like
baxter
or
charles
buxton
and
philosophical
divines
with
the
same
turn
like
the
dean
of
canterbury
seeking
to
give
a
sort
of
grand
stamp
of
generality
and
solemnity
to
this
antipathy
of
the
nonconformists
and
to
dress
it
out
as
a
law
of
human
progress
in
the
future
now
nothing
can
be
pleasanter
than
swimming
with
the
stream
and
we
might
gladly
if
we
could
try
in
our
unsystematic
way
to
help
baxter
and
charles
buxton
and
the
dean
of
canterbury
in
their
labours
at
once
philosophical
and
popular
but
we
have
got
fixed
in
our
minds
that
a
more
full
and
harmonious
development
of
their
humanity
is
what
the
nonconformists
most
want
that
narrowness
and
incompleteness
is
what
they
most
suffer
from
xix
in
a
word
that
in
what
we
call
provinciality
they
abound
but
in
what
we
may
call
totality
they
fall
short
and
they
fall
short
more
than
the
members
of
establishments
the
great
works
by
which
not
only
in
literature
art
and
science
generally
but
in
religion
itself
the
human
spirit
has
manifested
its
approaches
to
totality
and
a
full
harmonious
perfection
and
by
which
it
stimulates
and
helps
forward
the
world
general
perfection
come
not
from
nonconformists
but
from
men
who
either
belong
to
establishments
or
have
been
trained
in
them
a
nonconformist
minister
the
rev
edward
white
who
has
lately
written
a
temperate
and
pamphlet
against
church
establishments
says
that
the
unendowed
and
unestablished
communities
of
england
exert
full
as
much
moral
and
ennobling
influence
upon
the
conduct
of
statesmen
as
that
church
which
is
both
established
and
endowed
that
depends
upon
what
one
means
by
moral
and
ennobling
influence
the
believer
in
machinery
may
think
that
to
get
a
government
to
abolish
or
to
legalise
marriage
with
a
deceased
wife
sister
is
to
exert
a
moral
and
ennobling
influence
xx
upon
government
but
a
lover
of
perfection
who
looks
to
inward
ripeness
for
the
true
springs
of
conduct
will
surely
think
that
as
shakspeare
has
done
more
for
the
inward
ripeness
of
our
statesmen
than
watts
and
has
therefore
done
more
to
moralise
and
ennoble
them
so
an
establishment
which
has
produced
hooker
barrow
butler
has
done
more
to
moralise
and
ennoble
english
statesmen
and
their
conduct
than
communities
which
have
produced
the
nonconformist
divines
the
fruitful
men
of
english
puritanism
and
nonconformity
are
men
who
were
trained
within
the
pale
of
the
establishment
milton
baxter
wesley
a
generation
or
two
outside
the
establishment
and
puritanism
produces
men
of
national
mark
no
more
with
the
same
doctrine
and
discipline
men
of
national
mark
are
produced
in
scotland
but
in
an
establishment
with
the
same
doctrine
and
discipline
men
of
national
and
even
european
mark
are
produced
in
germany
switzerland
france
but
in
establishments
only
two
religious
disciplines
seem
exempted
or
comparatively
exempted
from
the
operation
of
the
law
which
seems
to
forbid
the
rearing
outside
of
national
establishments
of
men
of
the
xxi
highest
spiritual
significance
these
two
are
the
roman
catholic
and
the
jewish
and
these
both
of
them
rest
on
establishments
which
though
not
indeed
national
are
cosmopolitan
and
perhaps
here
what
the
individual
man
does
not
lose
by
these
conditions
of
his
rearing
the
citizen
and
the
state
of
which
he
is
a
citizen
loses
what
now
can
be
the
reason
of
this
undeniable
provincialism
of
the
english
puritans
and
protestant
nonconformists
a
provincialism
which
has
two
main
types
a
bitter
type
and
a
smug
type
but
which
in
both
its
types
is
vulgarising
and
thwarts
the
full
perfection
of
our
humanity
men
of
genius
and
character
are
born
and
reared
in
this
medium
as
in
any
other
from
the
faults
of
the
mass
such
men
will
always
be
comparatively
free
and
they
will
always
excite
our
interest
yet
in
this
medium
they
seem
to
have
a
special
difficulty
in
breaking
through
what
bounds
them
and
in
developing
their
totality
surely
the
reason
is
that
the
nonconformist
is
not
in
contact
with
the
main
current
of
national
life
like
the
member
of
an
establishment
in
a
matter
of
such
deep
and
vital
concern
as
religion
this
separation
from
the
main
current
of
the
national
life
has
xxii
peculiar
importance
in
the
following
essay
we
have
discussed
at
length
the
tendency
in
us
to
hebraise
as
we
call
it
that
is
to
sacrifice
all
other
sides
of
our
being
to
the
religious
side
this
tendency
has
its
cause
in
the
divine
beauty
and
grandeur
of
religion
and
bears
affecting
testimony
to
them
but
we
have
seen
that
it
has
dangers
for
us
we
have
seen
that
it
leads
to
a
narrow
and
twisted
growth
of
our
religious
side
itself
and
to
a
failure
in
perfection
but
if
we
tend
to
hebraise
even
in
an
establishment
with
the
main
current
of
national
life
flowing
round
us
and
reminding
us
in
all
ways
of
the
variety
and
fulness
of
human
existence
by
a
church
which
is
historical
as
the
state
itself
is
historical
and
whose
order
ceremonies
and
monuments
reach
like
those
of
the
state
far
beyond
any
fancies
and
devisings
of
ours
and
by
institutions
such
as
the
universities
formed
to
defend
and
advance
that
very
culture
and
development
which
it
is
the
danger
of
hebraising
to
make
us
neglect
how
much
more
must
we
tend
to
hebraise
when
we
lack
these
preventives
one
may
say
that
to
be
reared
a
member
of
an
establishment
is
in
itself
a
lesson
of
religious
moderation
and
a
help
towards
xxiii
culture
and
harmonious
perfection
instead
of
battling
for
his
own
private
forms
for
expressing
the
inexpressible
and
defining
the
undefinable
a
man
takes
those
which
have
commended
themselves
most
to
the
religious
life
of
his
nation
and
while
he
may
be
sure
that
within
those
forms
the
religious
side
of
his
own
nature
may
find
its
satisfaction
he
has
leisure
and
composure
to
satisfy
other
sides
of
his
nature
as
well
but
with
the
member
of
a
nonconforming
or
religious
community
how
different
the
sectary
eigene
grosse
erfindungen
as
goethe
calls
them
the
precious
discoveries
of
himself
and
his
friends
for
expressing
the
inexpressible
and
defining
the
undefinable
in
peculiar
forms
of
their
own
can
not
but
as
he
has
voluntarily
chosen
them
and
is
personally
responsible
for
them
fill
his
whole
mind
he
is
zealous
to
do
battle
for
them
and
affirm
them
for
in
affirming
them
he
affirms
himself
and
that
is
what
we
all
like
other
sides
of
his
being
are
thus
neglected
because
the
religious
side
always
tending
in
every
serious
man
to
predominance
over
our
other
spiritual
sides
is
in
him
made
quite
absorbing
and
tyrannous
by
xxiv
the
condition
of
and
challenge
which
he
has
chosen
for
himself
and
just
what
is
not
essential
in
religion
he
comes
to
mistake
for
essential
and
a
thousand
times
the
more
readily
because
he
has
chosen
it
of
himself
and
religious
activity
he
fancies
to
consist
in
battling
for
it
all
this
leaves
him
little
leisure
or
inclination
for
culture
to
which
besides
he
has
no
great
institutions
not
of
his
own
making
like
the
universities
connected
with
the
national
establishment
to
invite
him
but
only
such
institutions
as
like
the
order
and
discipline
of
his
religion
he
may
have
invented
for
himself
and
invented
under
the
sway
of
the
narrow
and
tyrannous
notions
of
religion
fostered
in
him
as
we
have
seen
thus
while
a
national
establishment
of
religion
favours
totality
forms
of
religion
to
use
an
expressive
popular
word
inevitably
favour
provincialism
but
the
nonconformists
and
many
of
our
liberal
friends
along
with
them
have
a
plausible
plan
for
getting
rid
of
this
provincialism
if
as
they
can
hardly
quite
deny
it
exists
let
us
all
be
in
the
same
boat
they
cry
open
the
universities
to
everybody
and
let
there
be
no
establishment
of
xxv
religion
at
all
open
the
universities
by
all
means
but
as
to
the
second
point
about
establishment
let
us
sift
the
proposal
a
little
it
does
seem
at
first
a
little
like
that
proposal
of
the
fox
who
had
lost
his
own
tail
to
put
all
the
other
foxes
in
the
same
boat
by
a
general
cutting
off
of
tails
and
we
know
that
moralists
have
decided
that
the
right
course
here
was
not
to
adopt
this
plausible
suggestion
and
cut
off
tails
all
round
but
rather
that
the
other
foxes
should
keep
their
tails
and
that
the
fox
without
a
tail
should
get
one
and
so
we
might
be
inclined
to
urge
that
to
cure
the
evil
of
the
nonconformists
provincialism
the
right
way
can
hardly
be
to
provincialise
us
all
round
however
perhaps
we
shall
not
be
provincialised
for
the
rev
edward
white
says
that
probably
when
all
good
men
alike
are
placed
in
a
condition
of
religious
equality
and
the
whole
complicated
iniquity
of
government
church
patronage
is
swept
away
more
of
moral
and
ennobling
influence
than
ever
will
be
brought
to
bear
upon
the
action
of
statesmen
we
already
have
an
example
of
religious
equality
in
our
colonies
in
the
colonies
says
the
times
we
see
religious
communities
unfettered
by
xxvi
and
the
state
relieved
from
one
of
the
most
troublesome
and
irritating
of
responsibilities
but
america
is
the
great
example
alleged
by
those
who
are
against
establishments
for
religion
our
topic
at
this
moment
is
the
influence
of
religious
establishments
on
culture
and
it
is
remarkable
that
mr
bright
who
has
taken
lately
to
representing
himself
as
above
all
a
promoter
of
reason
and
of
the
simple
natural
truth
of
things
and
his
policy
as
a
fostering
of
the
growth
of
intelligence
just
the
aims
as
is
well
known
of
culture
also
mr
bright
in
a
speech
at
birmingham
about
education
seized
on
the
very
point
which
seems
to
concern
our
topic
when
he
said
i
believe
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
offered
to
the
world
more
valuable
information
during
the
last
forty
years
than
all
europe
put
together
so
america
without
religious
establishments
seems
to
get
ahead
of
us
all
in
culture
and
totality
and
these
are
the
cure
for
provincialism
on
the
other
hand
another
friend
of
reason
and
the
simple
natural
truth
of
things
monsieur
renan
says
of
america
in
a
book
he
has
recently
published
what
seems
to
conflict
violently
with
xxvii
what
mr
bright
says
mr
bright
affirms
that
not
only
have
the
united
states
thus
informed
europe
but
they
have
done
it
without
a
great
apparatus
of
higher
and
scientific
instruction
and
by
dint
of
all
classes
in
america
being
sufficiently
educated
to
be
able
to
read
and
to
comprehend
and
to
think
and
that
i
maintain
is
the
foundation
of
all
subsequent
progress
and
then
comes
monsieur
renan
and
says
the
sound
instruction
of
the
people
is
an
effect
of
the
high
culture
of
certain
classes
the
countries
which
like
the
united
states
have
created
a
considerable
popular
instruction
without
any
serious
higher
instruction
will
long
have
to
expiate
this
fault
by
their
intellectual
mediocrity
their
vulgarity
of
manners
their
superficial
spirit
their
lack
of
general
intelligence
now
which
of
these
two
friends
of
culture
are
we
to
believe
monsieur
renan
seems
more
to
have
in
his
eye
what
we
ourselves
mean
by
culture
xxviii
because
mr
bright
always
has
in
his
eye
what
he
calls
a
commendable
interest
in
politics
and
political
agitations
as
he
said
only
the
other
day
at
birmingham
at
this
moment
in
fact
i
may
say
at
every
moment
in
the
history
of
a
free
country
there
is
nothing
that
is
so
much
worth
discussing
as
politics
and
he
keeps
repeating
with
all
the
powers
of
his
noble
oratory
the
old
story
how
to
the
thoughtfulness
and
intelligence
of
the
people
of
great
towns
we
owe
all
our
improvements
in
the
last
thirty
years
and
how
these
improvements
have
hitherto
consisted
in
parliamentary
reform
and
free
trade
and
abolition
of
church
rates
and
so
on
and
how
they
are
now
about
to
consist
in
getting
rid
of
and
in
introducing
a
free
table
and
in
abolishing
the
irish
church
by
the
power
of
the
nonconformists
antipathy
to
establishments
and
much
more
of
the
same
kind
and
though
our
pauperism
and
ignorance
and
all
the
questions
which
are
called
social
seem
now
to
be
forcing
themselves
upon
his
mind
yet
he
still
goes
on
with
his
glorifying
of
the
great
towns
and
the
liberals
and
their
operations
for
the
last
thirty
years
it
never
xxix
seems
to
occur
to
him
that
the
present
troubled
state
of
our
social
life
has
anything
to
do
with
the
thirty
years
blind
worship
of
their
nostrums
by
himself
and
our
liberal
friends
or
that
it
throws
any
doubts
upon
the
sufficiency
of
this
worship
but
he
thinks
what
is
still
amiss
is
due
to
the
stupidity
of
the
tories
and
will
be
cured
by
the
thoughtfulness
and
intelligence
of
the
great
towns
and
by
the
liberals
going
on
gloriously
with
their
political
operations
as
before
or
that
it
will
cure
itself
so
we
see
what
mr
bright
means
by
thoughtfulness
and
intelligence
and
in
what
manner
according
to
him
we
are
to
grow
in
them
and
no
doubt
in
america
all
classes
read
their
newspaper
and
take
a
commendable
interest
in
politics
more
than
here
or
anywhere
else
in
europe
but
in
the
following
essay
we
have
been
led
to
doubt
the
sufficiency
of
all
this
political
operating
of
ours
pursued
mechanically
as
we
pursue
it
and
we
found
that
general
intelligence
as
monsieur
renan
calls
it
or
in
our
own
words
a
reference
of
all
our
operating
to
a
firm
intelligible
law
of
things
was
just
what
we
were
without
and
that
we
were
without
it
because
we
worshipped
our
machinery
xxx
so
devoutly
therefore
we
conclude
that
monsieur
renan
more
than
mr
bright
means
by
reason
and
intelligence
the
same
thing
as
we
do
and
when
he
says
that
america
that
chosen
home
of
newspapers
and
politics
is
without
general
intelligence
we
think
it
likely
from
the
circumstances
of
the
case
that
this
is
so
and
that
in
culture
and
totality
america
instead
of
surpassing
us
all
falls
short
and
to
keep
to
our
point
of
the
influence
of
religious
establishments
upon
culture
and
a
high
development
of
our
humanity
we
can
surely
see
reasons
why
with
all
her
energy
and
fine
gifts
america
does
not
show
more
of
this
development
or
more
promise
of
this
in
the
following
essay
it
will
be
seen
how
our
society
distributes
itself
into
barbarians
philistines
and
populace
and
america
is
just
ourselves
with
the
barbarians
quite
left
out
and
the
populace
nearly
this
leaves
the
philistines
for
the
great
bulk
of
the
nation
a
livelier
sort
of
philistine
than
ours
and
with
the
pressure
and
false
ideal
of
our
barbarians
taken
away
but
left
all
the
more
to
himself
and
to
have
his
full
swing
and
as
we
have
found
that
the
strongest
and
most
vital
part
of
english
philistinism
was
the
xxxi
puritan
and
hebraising
and
that
its
hebraising
keeps
it
from
culture
and
totality
so
it
is
notorious
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
issues
from
this
class
and
reproduces
its
tendencies
its
narrow
conception
of
man
spiritual
range
and
of
his
one
thing
needful
from
maine
to
florida
and
back
again
all
america
hebraises
difficult
as
it
is
to
speak
of
a
people
merely
from
what
one
reads
yet
that
i
think
one
may
without
much
fear
of
contradiction
say
i
mean
when
in
the
united
states
any
spiritual
side
in
a
man
is
wakened
to
activity
it
is
generally
the
religious
side
and
the
religious
side
in
a
narrow
way
social
reformers
go
to
moses
or
paul
for
their
doctrines
and
have
no
notion
there
is
anywhere
else
to
go
to
earnest
young
men
at
schools
and
universities
instead
of
conceiving
salvation
as
a
harmonious
perfection
only
to
be
won
by
unreservedly
cultivating
many
sides
in
us
conceive
of
it
in
the
old
puritan
fashion
and
fling
themselves
ardently
upon
it
in
the
old
false
ways
of
this
fashion
which
we
know
so
well
and
such
as
hammond
the
american
revivalist
has
lately
at
spurgeon
tabernacle
been
refreshing
our
memory
with
now
if
america
thus
xxxii
hebraises
more
than
either
england
or
germany
will
any
one
deny
that
the
absence
of
religious
establishments
has
much
to
do
with
it
we
have
seen
how
establishments
tend
to
give
us
a
sense
of
a
historical
life
of
the
human
spirit
outside
and
beyond
our
own
fancies
and
feelings
how
they
thus
tend
to
suggest
new
sides
and
sympathies
in
us
to
cultivate
how
further
by
saving
us
from
having
to
invent
and
fight
for
our
own
forms
of
religion
they
give
us
leisure
and
calm
to
steady
our
view
of
religion
itself
the
most
overpowering
of
objects
as
it
is
the
grandest
and
to
enlarge
our
first
crude
notions
of
the
one
thing
needful
but
in
a
serious
people
where
every
one
has
to
choose
and
strive
for
his
own
order
and
discipline
of
religion
the
contention
about
these
occupies
his
mind
his
first
crude
notions
about
the
one
thing
needful
do
not
get
purged
and
they
invade
the
whole
spiritual
man
in
him
and
then
making
a
solitude
they
call
it
heavenly
peace
i
remember
a
nonconformist
manufacturer
in
a
town
of
the
midland
counties
telling
me
that
when
he
first
came
there
some
years
ago
the
place
had
no
dissenters
but
he
had
opened
an
independent
xxxiii
chapel
in
it
and
now
church
and
dissent
were
pretty
equally
divided
with
sharp
contests
between
them
i
said
that
seemed
a
pity
a
pity
cried
he
not
at
all
only
think
of
all
the
zeal
and
activity
which
the
collision
calls
forth
ah
but
my
dear
friend
i
answered
only
think
of
all
the
nonsense
which
you
now
hold
quite
firmly
which
you
would
never
have
held
if
you
had
not
been
contradicting
your
adversary
in
it
all
these
years
the
more
serious
the
people
and
the
more
prominent
the
religious
side
in
it
the
greater
is
the
danger
of
this
side
if
set
to
choose
out
forms
for
itself
and
fight
for
existence
swelling
and
spreading
till
it
swallows
all
other
spiritual
sides
up
intercepts
and
absorbs
all
nutriment
which
should
have
gone
to
them
and
leaves
hebraism
rampant
in
us
and
hellenism
stamped
out
culture
and
the
harmonious
perfection
of
our
whole
being
and
what
we
call
totality
then
become
secondary
matters
and
the
institutions
which
should
develope
these
take
the
same
narrow
and
partial
view
of
humanity
and
its
wants
as
the
free
religious
communities
take
just
as
the
free
churches
of
beecher
or
brother
noyes
with
their
provincialism
xxxiv
and
want
of
centrality
make
mere
hebraisers
in
religion
and
not
perfect
men
so
the
university
of
ezra
cornell
a
really
noble
monument
of
his
munificence
yet
seems
to
rest
on
a
provincial
misconception
of
what
culture
truly
is
and
to
be
calculated
to
produce
miners
or
engineers
or
architects
not
sweetness
and
light
and
therefore
when
the
rev
edward
white
asks
the
same
kind
of
question
about
america
that
he
has
asked
about
england
and
wants
to
know
whether
without
religious
establishments
as
much
is
not
done
in
america
for
the
higher
national
life
as
is
done
for
that
life
here
we
answer
in
the
same
way
as
we
did
before
that
as
much
is
not
done
because
to
enable
and
stir
up
people
to
read
their
bible
and
the
newspapers
and
to
get
a
practical
knowledge
of
their
business
does
not
serve
to
the
higher
spiritual
life
of
a
nation
so
much
as
culture
truly
conceived
serves
and
a
true
conception
of
culture
is
as
monsieur
renan
words
show
just
what
america
fails
in
to
the
many
who
think
that
culture
and
sweetness
and
light
are
all
moonshine
this
will
not
appear
to
matter
much
but
with
us
who
value
xxxv
them
and
who
think
that
we
have
traced
much
of
our
present
discomfort
to
the
want
of
them
it
weighs
a
great
deal
so
not
only
do
we
say
that
the
nonconformists
have
got
provincialism
and
lost
totality
by
the
want
of
a
religious
establishment
but
we
say
that
the
very
example
which
they
bring
forward
to
help
their
case
makes
against
them
and
that
when
they
triumphantly
show
us
america
without
religious
establishments
they
only
show
us
a
whole
nation
touched
amidst
all
its
greatness
and
promise
with
that
provincialism
which
it
is
our
aim
to
extirpate
in
the
english
nonconformists
but
now
to
evince
the
disinterestedness
which
culture
as
i
have
said
teaches
us
we
have
seen
the
narrowness
generated
in
puritanism
by
its
organisation
and
we
propose
to
cure
it
by
bringing
puritanism
more
into
contact
with
the
main
current
of
national
life
here
we
are
fully
at
one
with
the
dean
of
westminster
and
indeed
he
and
we
were
trained
in
the
same
school
to
mark
the
narrowness
of
puritanism
and
to
wish
to
cure
it
but
he
and
others
would
give
to
the
present
anglican
establishment
a
character
the
most
latitudinarian
as
it
is
called
possible
availing
themselves
for
this
xxxvi
purpose
of
the
diversity
of
tendencies
and
doctrines
which
does
undoubtedly
exist
already
in
the
anglican
formularies
and
they
would
say
to
the
puritans
come
all
of
you
into
this
liberally
conceived
anglican
establishment
but
to
say
this
is
hardly
perhaps
to
take
sufficient
account
of
the
course
of
history
or
of
the
strength
of
men
feelings
in
what
concerns
religion
or
of
the
gravity
which
may
have
come
to
attach
itself
to
points
of
religious
order
and
discipline
merely
when
the
rev
edward
white
talks
of
sweeping
away
the
whole
complicated
iniquity
of
government
church
patronage
he
uses
language
which
has
been
forced
upon
him
by
his
position
but
which
is
as
we
have
seen
devoid
of
any
real
solidity
but
when
he
talks
of
the
religious
communities
which
have
for
three
hundred
years
contended
for
the
power
of
the
congregation
in
the
management
of
their
own
affairs
then
he
talks
history
and
his
language
has
behind
it
in
my
opinion
facts
which
make
the
latitudinarianism
of
our
broad
churchmen
quite
illusory
certainly
culture
will
never
make
us
think
it
an
essential
of
religion
whether
we
have
in
our
church
discipline
a
popular
authority
of
elders
as
hooker
calls
xxxvii
it
or
whether
we
have
episcopal
jurisdiction
certainly
hooker
himself
did
not
think
it
an
essential
for
in
the
dedication
of
his
ecclesiastical
polity
speaking
of
these
questions
of
church
discipline
which
gave
occasion
to
his
great
work
he
says
they
are
in
truth
for
the
greatest
part
such
silly
things
that
very
easiness
doth
make
them
hard
to
be
disputed
of
in
serious
manner
hooker
great
work
against
the
impugners
of
the
order
and
discipline
of
the
church
of
england
was
written
and
this
is
too
indistinctly
seized
by
many
who
read
it
not
because
episcopalianism
is
essential
but
because
its
impugners
maintained
that
presbyterianism
is
essential
and
that
episcopalianism
is
sinful
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
is
either
essential
or
sinful
and
much
may
be
said
on
behalf
of
both
but
what
is
important
to
be
remarked
is
that
both
were
in
the
church
of
england
at
the
reformation
and
that
presbyterianism
was
only
extruded
gradually
we
have
mentioned
hooker
and
nothing
better
illustrates
what
has
just
been
asserted
than
the
following
incident
in
hooker
own
career
which
every
one
has
read
for
it
is
related
in
isaac
walton
life
of
hooker
but
of
which
xxxviii
probably
the
significance
has
been
fully
grasped
by
not
of
those
who
have
read
it
hooker
was
through
the
influence
of
archbishop
whitgift
appointed
in
master
of
the
temple
but
a
great
effort
had
just
been
made
to
obtain
the
place
for
a
walter
travers
well
known
in
that
day
though
now
it
is
hooker
name
which
alone
preserves
his
this
travers
was
then
at
the
temple
the
master
whose
death
made
the
vacancy
alvey
recommended
on
his
deathbed
travers
for
his
successor
the
society
was
favourable
to
him
and
he
had
the
support
of
the
lord
treasurer
burghley
after
hooker
appointment
to
the
mastership
travers
remained
and
combated
in
the
afternoons
the
doctrine
which
hooker
preached
in
the
mornings
now
this
travers
originally
a
fellow
of
trinity
college
cambridge
afterwards
at
the
temple
recommended
for
the
mastership
by
the
foregoing
master
whose
opinions
it
is
said
agreed
with
his
favoured
by
the
society
of
the
temple
and
supported
by
the
prime
minister
this
travers
was
not
an
episcopally
ordained
clergyman
at
all
he
was
a
presbyterian
xxxix
a
partisan
of
the
geneva
as
it
was
then
called
and
had
taken
orders
says
walton
by
the
presbyters
in
antwerp
in
another
place
walton
speaks
of
his
orders
yet
more
fully
he
had
disowned
he
says
the
english
established
church
and
episcopacy
and
went
to
geneva
and
afterwards
to
antwerp
to
be
ordained
minister
as
he
was
by
villers
and
cartwright
and
others
the
heads
of
a
congregation
there
and
so
came
back
again
more
confirmed
for
the
discipline
villers
and
cartwright
are
in
like
manner
examples
of
presbyterianism
within
the
church
of
england
which
was
common
enough
at
that
time
but
perhaps
nothing
can
better
give
us
a
lively
sense
of
its
presence
there
than
this
history
of
travers
which
is
as
if
binney
were
now
at
lincoln
inn
or
the
temple
were
to
be
a
candidate
favoured
by
the
benchers
and
by
the
prime
minister
for
the
mastership
and
were
only
kept
out
of
the
post
by
the
accident
of
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
influence
with
the
queen
carrying
a
rival
candidate
presbyterianism
with
its
popular
principle
of
the
power
of
the
congregation
in
the
management
of
xl
their
own
affairs
was
extruded
from
the
church
of
england
and
men
like
travers
can
no
longer
appear
in
her
pulpits
perhaps
if
a
government
like
that
of
elizabeth
with
secular
statesmen
like
the
cecils
and
ecclesiastical
statesmen
like
whitgift
could
have
been
prolonged
presbyterianism
might
by
a
wise
mixture
of
concession
and
firmness
have
been
absorbed
in
the
establishment
lord
bolingbroke
on
a
matter
of
this
kind
a
very
and
impartial
witness
says
in
a
work
far
too
little
read
his
remarks
on
english
history
the
measures
pursued
and
the
temper
observed
in
queen
elizabeth
time
tended
to
diminish
the
religious
opposition
by
a
slow
a
gentle
and
for
that
very
reason
an
effectual
progression
there
was
even
room
to
hope
that
when
the
first
fire
of
the
dissenters
zeal
was
passed
reasonable
terms
of
union
with
the
established
church
might
be
accepted
by
such
of
them
as
were
not
intoxicated
with
fanaticism
these
were
friends
to
order
though
they
disputed
about
it
if
these
friends
of
calvin
discipline
had
been
once
incorporated
with
the
established
church
the
remaining
sectaries
would
have
been
of
little
moment
either
for
numbers
or
xli
reputation
and
the
very
means
which
were
proper
to
gain
these
friends
were
likewise
the
most
effectual
to
hinder
the
increase
of
them
and
of
the
other
sectaries
in
the
meantime
the
temper
and
ill
judgment
of
the
stuarts
made
shipwreck
of
all
policy
of
this
kind
yet
speaking
even
of
the
time
of
the
stuarts
but
their
early
time
clarendon
says
that
if
bishop
andrewes
had
succeeded
bancroft
at
canterbury
the
disaffection
of
separatists
might
have
been
stayed
and
healed
this
however
was
not
to
be
and
presbyterianism
after
exercising
for
some
years
the
law
of
the
strongest
itself
in
charles
the
second
reign
suffered
under
this
law
and
was
finally
cast
out
from
the
church
of
england
now
the
points
of
church
discipline
at
issue
between
presbyterianism
and
episcopalianism
are
as
has
been
said
not
essential
they
might
probably
once
have
been
settled
in
a
sense
altogether
favourable
to
episcopalianism
hooker
may
have
been
right
in
thinking
that
there
were
in
his
time
circumstances
which
made
it
essential
that
they
should
be
settled
in
this
sense
though
the
points
in
themselves
were
not
essential
but
by
the
very
fact
of
the
settlement
not
having
then
been
effected
of
the
xlii
breach
having
gone
on
and
widened
of
the
nonconformists
not
having
been
amicably
incorporated
with
the
establishment
but
violently
cast
out
from
it
the
circumstances
are
now
altogether
altered
isaac
walton
a
fervent
churchman
complains
that
the
principles
of
the
nonconformists
grew
at
last
to
such
a
height
and
were
vented
so
daringly
that
beside
the
loss
of
life
and
limbs
the
church
and
state
were
both
forced
to
use
such
other
severities
as
will
not
admit
of
an
excuse
if
it
had
not
been
to
prevent
confusion
and
the
perilous
consequences
of
it
but
those
very
severities
have
of
themselves
made
union
on
an
episcopalian
footing
impossible
besides
presbyterianism
the
popular
authority
of
elders
the
power
of
the
congregation
in
the
management
of
their
own
affairs
has
that
warrant
given
to
it
by
scripture
and
by
the
proceedings
of
the
early
christian
churches
it
is
so
consonant
with
the
spirit
of
protestantism
which
made
the
reformation
and
which
has
such
strength
in
this
country
it
is
so
predominant
in
the
practice
of
other
reformed
churches
it
was
so
strong
in
the
original
reformed
church
of
england
that
one
can
not
help
doubting
whether
any
settlement
which
suppressed
it
could
have
been
really
permanent
xliii
and
whether
it
would
not
have
kept
appearing
again
and
again
and
causing
dissension
well
then
if
culture
is
the
disinterested
endeavour
after
perfection
will
it
not
make
us
wish
to
cure
the
provincialism
of
the
nonconformists
not
by
making
churchmen
provincial
along
with
them
but
by
letting
their
popular
church
discipline
formerly
found
in
the
national
church
and
still
found
in
the
affections
and
practice
of
a
good
part
of
the
nation
appear
in
the
national
church
once
more
and
thus
to
bring
nonconformists
into
contact
again
as
their
greater
fathers
were
with
the
main
stream
of
national
life
why
should
not
a
presbyterian
or
congregational
church
based
on
this
considerable
and
important
though
not
essential
principle
of
the
power
in
the
church
management
be
established
with
equal
rank
for
its
chiefs
with
the
chiefs
of
episcopacy
and
with
admissibility
of
its
ministers
under
a
revised
system
of
patronage
and
preferment
to
benefices
side
by
side
with
the
episcopal
church
as
the
calvinist
and
lutheran
churches
are
established
side
by
side
in
france
and
germany
such
a
congregational
church
would
unite
the
main
bodies
of
protestants
who
are
now
separatists
and
xliv
separation
would
cease
to
be
the
law
of
their
religious
order
then
through
this
concession
on
a
really
considerable
point
of
difference
that
endless
splitting
into
churches
on
quite
inconsiderable
points
of
difference
which
must
prevail
so
long
as
separatism
is
the
first
law
of
a
nonconformist
religious
existence
would
be
checked
culture
would
then
find
a
place
among
english
followers
of
the
popular
authority
of
elders
as
it
has
long
found
it
among
the
followers
of
episcopal
jurisdiction
and
this
we
should
gain
by
merely
recognising
regularising
and
restoring
an
element
which
appeared
once
in
the
reformed
national
church
and
which
is
considerable
and
national
enough
to
have
a
sound
claim
to
appear
there
still
so
far
then
is
culture
from
making
us
unjust
to
the
nonconformists
because
it
forbids
us
to
worship
their
fetishes
that
it
even
leads
us
to
propose
to
do
more
for
them
than
they
themselves
venture
to
claim
it
leads
us
also
to
respect
what
is
solid
and
respectable
in
their
convictions
while
their
latitudinarian
friends
make
light
of
it
not
that
the
forms
in
which
the
human
spirit
tries
to
express
the
inexpressible
or
the
forms
by
which
man
tries
to
xlv
worship
have
or
can
have
as
has
been
said
for
the
follower
of
perfection
anything
necessary
or
eternal
if
the
new
testament
and
the
practice
of
the
primitive
christians
sanctioned
the
popular
form
of
church
government
a
thousand
times
more
expressly
than
they
do
if
the
church
since
constantine
were
a
thousand
times
more
of
a
departure
from
the
scheme
of
primitive
christianity
than
it
can
be
shown
to
be
that
does
not
at
all
make
as
is
supposed
by
men
in
bondage
to
the
letter
the
popular
form
of
church
government
alone
and
always
sacred
and
binding
or
the
work
of
constantine
a
thing
to
be
regretted
what
is
alone
and
always
sacred
and
binding
for
man
is
the
climbing
towards
his
total
perfection
and
the
machinery
by
which
he
does
this
varies
in
value
according
as
it
helps
him
to
do
it
the
planters
of
christianity
had
their
roots
in
deep
and
rich
grounds
of
human
life
and
achievement
both
jewish
and
also
greek
and
had
thus
a
comparatively
firm
and
wide
basis
amidst
all
the
vehement
inspiration
of
their
mighty
movement
and
change
by
their
strong
inspiration
they
carried
men
off
the
old
basis
of
life
and
culture
whether
jewish
or
greek
and
generations
arose
xlvi
who
had
their
roots
in
neither
world
and
were
in
contact
therefore
with
no
full
and
great
stream
of
human
life
christianity
might
have
lost
herself
if
it
had
not
been
for
some
such
change
as
that
of
the
fourth
century
in
a
multitude
of
churches
like
the
churches
of
english
nonconformity
after
its
founders
departed
churches
without
great
men
and
without
furtherance
for
the
higher
life
of
humanity
at
a
critical
moment
came
constantine
and
placed
christianity
or
let
us
rather
say
placed
the
human
spirit
whose
totality
was
endangered
in
contact
with
the
main
current
of
human
life
and
his
work
was
justified
by
its
fruits
in
men
like
augustine
and
dante
and
indeed
in
all
the
great
men
of
christianity
catholics
or
protestants
ever
since
and
one
may
go
beyond
this
monsieur
albert
reville
whose
religious
writings
are
always
interesting
says
that
the
conception
which
cultivated
and
philosophical
jews
now
entertain
of
christianity
and
its
founder
is
probably
destined
to
become
the
conception
which
christians
themselves
will
entertain
socinians
are
fond
of
saying
the
same
thing
about
the
socinian
conception
of
christianity
even
if
this
were
true
it
would
still
have
been
xlvii
better
for
a
man
through
the
last
eighteen
hundred
years
to
have
been
a
christian
and
a
member
of
one
of
the
great
christian
communions
than
to
have
been
a
jew
or
a
socinian
because
the
being
in
contact
with
the
main
stream
of
human
life
is
of
more
moment
for
a
man
total
spiritual
growth
and
for
his
bringing
to
perfection
the
gifts
committed
to
him
which
is
his
business
on
earth
than
any
speculative
opinion
which
he
may
hold
or
think
he
holds
luther
whom
we
have
called
a
philistine
of
genius
and
who
because
he
was
a
philistine
had
a
coarseness
and
lack
of
spiritual
delicacy
which
have
harmed
his
disciples
but
who
because
he
was
a
genius
had
splendid
flashes
of
spiritual
insight
luther
says
admirably
in
his
commentary
on
the
book
of
daniel
a
god
is
simply
that
whereon
the
human
heart
rests
with
trust
faith
hope
and
love
if
the
resting
is
right
then
the
god
too
is
right
if
the
resting
is
wrong
then
the
god
too
is
illusory
in
other
words
the
worth
of
what
a
man
thinks
about
god
and
the
objects
of
religion
depends
on
what
the
man
is
and
what
the
man
is
depends
upon
his
having
more
or
less
reached
the
measure
of
a
perfect
and
total
man
xlviii
all
this
is
true
and
yet
culture
as
we
have
seen
has
more
tenderness
for
scruples
of
the
nonconformists
than
have
their
broad
church
friends
that
is
because
culture
disinterestedly
trying
in
its
aim
at
perfection
to
see
things
as
they
really
are
sees
how
worthy
and
divine
a
thing
is
the
religious
side
in
man
though
it
is
not
the
whole
of
man
and
when
greg
who
differs
from
us
about
edification
and
certainly
we
do
not
seem
likely
to
agree
with
him
as
to
what
edifies
finding
himself
moved
by
some
extraneous
considerations
or
other
to
take
a
church
part
against
its
enemies
calls
taking
a
church
part
returning
to
base
uses
culture
teaches
us
how
out
of
place
is
this
language
and
that
to
use
it
shows
an
inadequate
conception
of
human
nature
and
that
no
church
will
thank
a
man
for
taking
its
part
in
this
fashion
but
will
leave
him
with
indifference
to
the
tender
mercies
of
his
benthamite
friends
but
avoiding
benthamism
or
an
inadequate
conception
of
the
religious
side
in
man
culture
makes
us
also
avoid
mialism
or
an
inadequate
conception
of
man
totality
therefore
to
the
worth
and
grandeur
of
the
religious
side
in
man
culture
is
rejoiced
and
willing
to
pay
any
tribute
xlix
except
the
tribute
of
man
totality
true
the
order
and
liturgy
of
the
church
of
england
one
may
be
well
contented
to
live
and
to
die
with
and
they
are
such
as
to
inspire
an
affectionate
and
revering
attachment
true
the
reproaches
of
nonconformists
against
this
order
for
retaining
badges
of
antichristian
recognisance
and
for
corrupting
the
right
form
of
church
polity
with
manifold
popish
rites
and
ceremonies
true
their
assertion
of
the
essentialness
of
their
own
supposed
scriptural
order
and
their
belief
in
its
eternal
fitness
are
founded
on
illusion
true
the
whole
attitude
of
horror
and
holy
superiority
assumed
by
puritanism
towards
the
church
of
rome
is
wrong
and
false
and
well
merits
sir
henry
wotton
rebuke
take
heed
of
thinking
that
the
farther
you
go
from
the
church
of
rome
the
nearer
you
are
to
god
true
one
of
the
best
wishes
one
could
form
for
spurgeon
or
father
jackson
is
that
they
might
be
permitted
to
learn
on
this
side
the
grave
for
if
they
do
not
a
considerable
surprise
is
certainly
reserved
for
them
on
the
other
that
whitfield
and
wesley
were
not
at
all
better
than
francis
and
that
they
themselves
are
not
at
all
better
than
lacordaire
yet
l
in
spite
of
all
this
so
noble
and
divine
a
thing
is
religion
so
respectable
is
that
earnestness
which
desires
a
with
one
strain
of
doctrine
so
attaching
is
the
order
and
discipline
by
which
we
are
used
to
have
our
religion
conveyed
so
many
claims
on
our
regard
has
that
popular
form
of
church
government
for
which
nonconformists
contend
so
perfectly
compatible
is
it
with
all
progress
towards
perfection
that
culture
would
make
us
shy
even
to
propose
to
nonconformists
the
acceptance
of
the
anglican
and
the
episcopal
order
and
would
be
forward
to
wish
them
a
of
their
own
approving
and
the
church
discipline
to
which
they
are
attached
and
accustomed
only
not
at
the
price
of
mialism
that
is
of
a
doctrine
which
leaves
the
nonconformists
in
holes
and
corners
out
of
contact
with
the
main
current
of
national
life
one
can
lay
one
finger
indeed
on
the
line
by
which
this
doctrine
has
grown
up
and
see
how
the
essential
part
of
nonconformity
is
a
popular
analogous
to
that
of
the
other
reformed
churches
and
how
its
voluntaryism
is
an
accident
it
contended
for
the
establishment
of
its
own
as
the
only
true
li
one
and
beaten
in
this
contention
and
seeing
its
rival
established
it
came
down
to
the
more
plausible
proposal
to
place
all
good
men
alike
in
a
condition
of
religious
equality
and
this
plan
of
proceeding
originally
taken
as
a
mere
became
by
long
sticking
to
it
and
preaching
it
up
first
fair
then
righteous
then
the
only
righteous
then
at
last
necessary
to
salvation
this
is
the
plan
for
remedying
the
nonconformists
divorce
from
contact
with
the
national
life
by
divorcing
churchmen
too
from
contact
with
it
that
is
as
we
have
familiarly
before
put
it
the
tailless
foxes
are
for
cutting
off
tails
all
round
but
this
the
other
foxes
could
not
wisely
grant
unless
it
were
proved
that
tails
are
of
no
value
and
so
too
unless
it
is
proved
that
contact
with
the
main
current
of
national
life
is
of
no
value
and
we
have
shown
that
it
is
of
the
greatest
value
we
can
not
safely
even
to
please
the
nonconformists
in
a
matter
where
we
would
please
them
as
much
as
possible
admit
mialism
but
now
as
we
have
shown
the
disinterestedness
which
culture
enjoins
and
its
obedience
not
to
likings
or
dislikings
but
to
the
aim
of
perfection
let
us
show
its
flexibility
its
independence
of
machinery
that
lii
other
and
greater
prophet
of
intelligence
and
reason
and
the
simple
natural
truth
of
things
mr
bright
means
by
these
as
we
have
seen
a
certain
set
of
measures
which
suit
the
special
ends
of
liberal
and
nonconformist
partisans
for
instance
reason
and
justice
towards
ireland
mean
the
abolishment
of
the
iniquitous
protestant
ascendency
in
such
a
particular
way
as
to
suit
the
nonconformists
antipathy
to
establishments
reason
and
justice
pursued
in
a
different
way
by
distributing
among
the
three
main
churches
of
ireland
the
roman
catholic
the
anglican
and
the
presbyterian
the
church
property
of
ireland
would
immediately
cease
for
mr
bright
and
the
nonconformists
to
be
reason
and
justice
at
all
and
would
become
as
spurgeon
says
a
setting
up
of
the
roman
image
thus
we
see
that
the
sort
of
intelligence
reached
by
culture
is
more
disinterested
than
the
sort
of
intelligence
reached
by
belonging
to
the
liberal
party
in
the
great
towns
and
taking
a
commendable
interest
in
politics
but
still
more
striking
is
the
difference
between
the
two
views
of
intelligence
when
we
see
that
culture
not
only
makes
a
quite
disinterested
choice
of
the
machinery
liii
proper
to
carry
us
towards
sweetness
and
light
and
to
make
reason
and
the
will
of
god
prevail
but
by
even
this
machinery
does
not
hold
stiffly
and
blindly
and
easily
passes
on
beyond
it
to
that
for
the
sake
of
which
it
chose
it
for
instance
culture
leads
us
to
think
that
the
ends
of
human
perfection
might
be
best
served
by
establishing
that
is
by
bringing
into
contact
with
the
main
current
of
the
national
life
in
ireland
the
roman
catholic
and
the
presbyterian
churches
along
with
the
anglican
church
and
in
england
a
presbyterian
or
congregational
church
of
like
rank
and
status
with
our
episcopalian
one
it
leads
us
to
think
that
we
should
really
in
this
way
be
working
to
make
reason
and
the
will
of
god
prevail
because
we
should
be
making
roman
catholics
better
citizens
and
nonconformists
nay
and
churchmen
along
with
them
and
more
complete
men
but
undoubtedly
there
are
great
difficulties
in
such
a
plan
as
this
and
the
plan
is
not
one
which
looks
very
likely
to
be
adopted
it
is
a
plan
more
for
a
time
of
creative
statesmen
like
the
time
of
elizabeth
than
for
a
time
of
instrumental
liv
statesmen
like
the
present
the
churchman
must
rise
above
his
ordinary
self
in
order
to
favour
it
and
the
nonconformist
has
worshipped
his
fetish
of
separatism
so
long
that
he
is
likely
to
wish
still
to
remain
like
ephraim
a
wild
ass
alone
by
himself
the
centre
of
power
being
where
it
is
our
instrumental
statesmen
have
every
temptation
as
is
shown
more
at
large
in
the
following
essay
in
the
first
place
to
relieve
themselves
as
the
times
says
of
troublesome
and
irritating
responsibilities
in
the
second
place
when
they
must
act
to
go
along
as
they
do
with
the
ordinary
self
of
those
on
whose
favour
they
depend
to
adopt
as
their
own
its
desires
and
to
serve
them
with
fidelity
and
even
if
possible
with
impulsiveness
this
is
the
more
easy
for
them
because
there
are
not
wanting
and
there
never
will
be
wanting
thinkers
like
baxter
charles
buxton
and
the
dean
of
canterbury
to
swim
with
the
stream
but
to
swim
with
it
philosophically
to
call
the
desires
of
the
ordinary
self
of
any
great
section
of
the
community
edicts
of
the
national
mind
and
laws
of
human
progress
and
to
give
them
a
general
a
philosophic
and
an
imposing
expression
a
generous
statesman
may
lv
honestly
therefore
soon
unlearn
any
disposition
to
put
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
in
advocating
these
desires
and
may
advocate
them
with
fervour
and
impulsiveness
therefore
a
plan
such
as
that
which
we
have
indicated
does
not
seem
a
plan
so
likely
to
find
favour
as
a
plan
for
abolishing
the
irish
church
by
the
power
of
the
nonconformists
antipathy
to
establishments
but
to
tell
us
that
our
fond
dreams
are
on
that
account
shattered
is
inexact
and
is
the
sort
of
language
which
ought
to
be
addressed
to
the
promoters
of
intelligence
through
public
meetings
and
a
commendable
interest
in
politics
when
they
fail
in
their
designs
and
not
to
us
for
we
are
fond
stickers
to
no
machinery
not
even
our
own
and
we
have
no
doubt
that
perfection
can
be
reached
without
it
with
free
churches
as
with
established
churches
and
with
instrumental
statesmen
as
with
creative
statesmen
but
it
can
never
be
reached
without
seeing
things
as
they
really
are
and
it
is
to
this
therefore
and
to
no
machinery
in
the
world
that
culture
sticks
fondly
it
insists
that
men
should
not
mistake
as
they
are
prone
to
mistake
their
natural
taste
for
the
bathos
for
a
relish
for
the
sublime
and
if
statesmen
either
lvi
with
their
tongue
in
their
cheek
or
through
a
generous
impulsiveness
tell
them
their
natural
taste
for
the
bathos
is
a
relish
for
the
sublime
there
is
the
more
need
for
culture
to
tell
them
the
contrary
it
is
delusion
on
this
point
which
is
fatal
and
against
delusion
on
this
point
culture
works
it
is
not
fatal
to
our
liberal
friends
to
labour
for
free
trade
extension
of
the
suffrage
and
abolition
of
instead
of
graver
social
ends
but
it
is
fatal
to
them
to
be
told
by
their
flatterers
and
to
believe
with
our
pauperism
increasing
more
rapidly
than
our
population
that
they
have
performed
a
great
an
heroic
work
by
occupying
themselves
exclusively
for
the
last
thirty
years
with
these
liberal
nostrums
and
that
the
right
and
good
course
for
them
now
is
to
go
on
occupying
themselves
with
the
like
for
the
future
it
is
not
fatal
to
americans
to
have
no
religious
establishments
and
no
effective
centres
of
high
culture
but
it
is
fatal
to
them
to
be
told
by
their
flatterers
and
to
believe
that
they
are
the
most
intelligent
people
in
the
whole
world
when
of
intelligence
in
the
true
and
fruitful
sense
of
the
word
they
even
singularly
as
we
have
seen
come
short
it
is
not
lvii
fatal
to
the
nonconformists
to
remain
with
their
separated
churches
but
it
is
fatal
to
them
to
be
told
by
their
flatterers
and
to
believe
that
theirs
is
the
one
pure
and
way
of
worshipping
god
that
provincialism
and
loss
of
totality
have
not
come
to
them
from
following
it
or
that
provincialism
and
loss
of
totality
are
not
evils
it
is
not
fatal
to
the
english
nation
to
abolish
the
irish
church
by
the
power
of
the
nonconformists
antipathy
to
establishments
but
it
is
fatal
to
it
to
be
told
by
its
flatterers
and
to
believe
that
it
is
abolishing
it
through
reason
and
justice
when
it
is
really
abolishing
it
through
this
power
or
to
expect
the
fruits
of
reason
and
justice
from
anything
but
the
spirit
of
reason
and
justice
themselves
now
culture
because
of
its
keen
sense
of
what
is
really
fatal
is
all
the
more
disposed
to
be
pliant
and
easy
about
what
is
not
fatal
and
because
machinery
is
the
bane
of
politics
and
an
inward
working
and
not
machinery
is
what
we
most
want
we
keep
advising
our
ardent
young
liberal
friends
to
think
less
of
machinery
to
stand
more
aloof
from
the
arena
of
politics
at
present
and
rather
to
try
and
promote
with
us
an
inward
working
they
do
not
listen
lviii
to
us
and
they
rush
into
the
arena
of
politics
where
their
merits
indeed
seem
to
be
little
appreciated
as
yet
and
then
they
complain
of
the
reformed
constituencies
and
call
the
new
parliament
a
philistine
parliament
as
if
a
nation
nourished
and
reared
in
hebraising
could
give
us
just
yet
anything
better
than
a
philistine
parliament
for
would
a
barbarian
parliament
be
even
so
good
or
a
populace
parliament
for
our
part
we
rejoice
to
see
our
dear
old
friends
the
hebraising
philistines
gathered
in
force
in
the
valley
of
jehoshaphat
before
their
final
conversion
which
will
certainly
come
but
for
this
conversion
we
must
not
try
to
oust
them
from
their
places
and
to
contend
for
machinery
with
them
but
we
must
work
on
them
inwardly
and
cure
them
of
hebraising
yet
the
days
of
israel
are
innumerable
and
in
its
blame
of
hebraising
too
and
in
its
praise
of
hellenising
culture
must
not
fail
to
keep
its
flexibility
and
to
give
to
its
judgments
that
passing
and
provisional
character
which
we
have
seen
it
impose
on
its
preferences
and
rejections
of
machinery
now
and
for
us
it
is
a
time
to
hellenise
and
to
praise
knowing
for
we
have
hebraised
too
much
lix
and
have
doing
but
the
habits
and
discipline
received
from
hebraism
remain
for
our
race
an
eternal
possession
and
as
humanity
is
constituted
one
must
never
assign
them
the
second
rank
without
being
ready
to
restore
them
to
the
first
rank
to
walk
staunchly
by
the
best
light
one
has
to
be
strict
and
sincere
with
oneself
not
to
be
of
the
number
of
those
who
say
and
do
not
to
be
in
earnest
this
is
the
discipline
by
which
alone
man
is
enabled
to
rescue
his
life
from
thraldom
to
the
passing
moment
and
to
his
bodily
senses
to
ennoble
it
and
to
make
it
eternal
and
this
discipline
has
been
nowhere
so
effectively
taught
as
in
the
school
of
hebraism
sophocles
and
plato
knew
as
well
as
the
author
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
that
without
holiness
no
man
shall
see
god
and
their
notion
of
what
goes
to
make
up
holiness
was
larger
than
his
but
the
intense
and
convinced
energy
with
which
the
hebrew
both
of
the
old
and
of
the
new
testament
threw
himself
upon
his
ideal
and
which
inspired
the
incomparable
definition
of
the
great
christian
virtue
faith
the
substance
of
things
hoped
for
the
evidence
of
things
not
seen
this
energy
of
faith
in
its
ideal
has
lx
belonged
to
hebraism
alone
as
our
idea
of
holiness
enlarges
and
our
scope
of
perfection
widens
beyond
the
narrow
limits
to
which
the
of
hebraising
has
tended
to
confine
it
we
shall
come
again
to
hebraism
for
that
devout
energy
in
embracing
our
ideal
which
alone
can
give
to
man
the
happiness
of
doing
what
he
knows
if
ye
know
these
things
happy
are
ye
if
ye
do
them
the
last
word
for
infirm
humanity
will
always
be
that
for
this
word
reiterated
with
a
power
now
sublime
now
affecting
but
always
admirable
our
race
will
as
long
as
the
world
lasts
return
to
hebraism
and
the
bible
which
preaches
this
word
will
forever
remain
as
goethe
called
it
not
only
a
national
book
but
the
book
of
the
nations
again
and
again
after
what
seemed
breaches
and
separations
the
prophetic
promise
to
jerusalem
will
still
be
true
lo
thy
sons
come
whom
thou
sentest
away
they
come
gathered
from

unto

of

holy
one

in
the
remembrance

preamble
culture
and
anarchy
in
one
of
his
speeches
a
year
or
two
ago
that
fine
speaker
and
famous
liberal
mr
bright
took
occasion
to
have
a
fling
at
the
friends
and
preachers
of
culture
people
who
talk
about
what
they
call
culture
said
he
contemptuously
by
which
they
mean
a
smattering
of
the
two
dead
languages
of
greek
and
latin
and
he
went
on
to
remark
in
a
strain
with
which
modern
speakers
and
writers
have
made
us
very
familiar
how
poor
a
thing
this
culture
is
how
little
good
it
can
do
to
the
world
and
how
absurd
it
is
for
its
possessors
to
set
much
store
by
it
and
the
other
day
a
younger
liberal
than
mr
bright
one
of
a
school
whose
mission
it
is
to
bring
into
order
and
system
that
body
of
truth
of
which
the
earlier
liberals
merely
touched
the
outside
a
member
of
the
university
of
oxford
and
a
very
clever
writer
frederic
harrison
developed
in
the
systematic
and
stringent
manner
of
his
school
the
thesis
which
mr
bright
had
propounded
in
only
general
terms
perhaps
the
very
silliest
cant
of
the
day
said
frederic
harrison
is
the
cant
about
culture
culture
is
a
desirable
quality
in
a
critic
of
new
books
and
sits
well
on
a
possessor
of
belles
lettres
but
as
applied
to
politics
it
means
simply
a
turn
for
small
love
of
selfish
ease
and
indecision
in
action
the
man
of
culture
is
in
politics
one
of
the
poorest
mortals
alive
for
simple
pedantry
and
want
of
good
sense
no
man
is
his
equal
no
assumption
is
too
unreal
no
end
is
too
unpractical
for
him
but
the
active
exercise
of
politics
requires
common
sense
sympathy
trust
resolution
and
enthusiasm
qualities
which
your
man
of
culture
has
carefully
rooted
up
lest
they
damage
the
delicacy
of
his
critical
olfactories
perhaps
they
are
the
only
class
of
responsible
beings
in
the
community
who
can
not
with
safety
be
entrusted
with
power
now
for
my
part
i
do
not
wish
to
see
men
of
culture
asking
to
be
entrusted
with
power
and
indeed
i
have
freely
said
that
in
my
opinion
the
speech
most
proper
at
present
for
a
man
of
culture
to
make
to
a
body
of
his
who
get
him
into
a
room
is
socrates
know
thyself
and
this
is
not
a
speech
to
be
made
by
men
wanting
to
be
entrusted
with
power
for
this
very
indifference
to
direct
political
action
i
have
been
taken
to
task
by
the
daily
telegraph
coupled
by
a
strange
perversity
of
fate
with
just
that
very
one
of
the
hebrew
prophets
whose
style
i
admire
the
least
and
called
an
elegant
jeremiah
it
is
because
i
say
to
use
the
words
which
the
daily
telegraph
puts
in
my
mouth
you
make
a
fuss
because
you
have
no
vote
that
is
vulgarity
you
hold
big
meetings
to
agitate
for
reform
bills
and
to
repeal
corn
laws
that
is
the
very
height
of
vulgarity
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
am
called
sometimes
an
elegant
jeremiah
sometimes
a
spurious
jeremiah
a
jeremiah
about
the
reality
of
whose
mission
the
writer
in
the
daily
telegraph
has
his
doubts
it
is
evident
therefore
that
i
have
so
taken
my
line
as
not
to
be
exposed
to
the
whole
brunt
of
frederic
harrison
censure
still
i
have
often
spoken
in
praise
of
culture
i
have
striven
to
make
all
my
works
and
ways
serve
the
interests
of
culture
i
take
culture
to
be
something
a
great
deal
more
than
what
frederic
harrison
and
others
call
it
a
desirable
quality
in
a
critic
of
new
books
nay
even
though
to
a
certain
extent
i
am
disposed
to
agree
with
frederic
harrison
that
men
of
culture
are
just
the
class
of
responsible
beings
in
this
community
of
ours
who
can
not
properly
at
present
be
entrusted
with
power
i
am
not
sure
that
i
do
not
think
this
the
fault
of
our
community
rather
than
of
the
men
of
culture
in
short
although
like
mr
bright
and
frederic
harrison
and
the
editor
of
the
daily
telegraph
and
a
large
body
of
valued
friends
of
mine
i
am
a
liberal
yet
i
am
a
liberal
tempered
by
experience
reflection
and
renouncement
and
i
am
above
all
a
believer
in
culture
therefore
i
propose
now
to
try
and
enquire
in
the
simple
unsystematic
way
which
best
suits
both
my
taste
and
my
powers
what
culture
really
is
what
good
it
can
do
what
is
our
own
special
need
of
it
and
i
shall
seek
to
find
some
plain
grounds
on
which
a
faith
in
culture
both
my
own
faith
in
it
and
the
faith
of
others
may
rest
securely
chapter
i
the
disparagers
of
culture
make
its
motive
curiosity
sometimes
indeed
they
make
its
motive
mere
exclusiveness
and
vanity
the
culture
which
is
supposed
to
plume
itself
on
a
smattering
of
greek
and
latin
is
a
culture
which
is
begotten
by
nothing
so
intellectual
as
curiosity
it
is
valued
either
out
of
sheer
vanity
and
ignorance
or
else
as
an
engine
of
social
and
class
distinction
separating
its
holder
like
a
badge
or
title
from
other
people
who
have
not
got
it
no
serious
man
would
call
this
culture
or
attach
any
value
to
it
as
culture
at
all
to
find
the
real
ground
for
the
very
differing
estimate
which
serious
people
will
set
upon
culture
we
must
find
some
motive
for
culture
in
the
terms
of
which
may
lie
a
real
ambiguity
and
such
a
motive
the
word
curiosity
gives
us
i
have
before
now
pointed
out
that
in
english
we
do
not
like
the
foreigners
use
this
word
in
a
good
sense
as
well
as
in
a
bad
sense
with
us
the
word
is
always
used
in
a
somewhat
disapproving
sense
a
liberal
and
intelligent
eagerness
about
the
things
of
the
mind
may
be
meant
by
a
foreigner
when
he
speaks
of
curiosity
but
with
us
the
word
always
conveys
a
certain
notion
of
frivolous
and
unedifying
activity
in
the
quarterly
review
some
little
time
ago
was
an
estimate
of
the
celebrated
french
critic
monsieur
and
a
very
inadequate
estimate
it
in
my
judgment
was
and
its
inadequacy
consisted
chiefly
in
this
that
in
our
english
way
it
left
out
of
sight
the
double
sense
really
involved
in
the
word
curiosity
thinking
enough
was
said
to
stamp
monsieur
with
blame
if
it
was
said
that
he
was
impelled
in
his
operations
as
a
critic
by
curiosity
and
omitting
either
to
perceive
that
monsieur
himself
and
many
other
people
with
him
would
consider
that
this
was
praiseworthy
and
not
blameworthy
or
to
point
out
why
it
ought
really
to
be
accounted
worthy
of
blame
and
not
of
praise
for
as
there
is
a
curiosity
about
intellectual
matters
which
is
futile
and
merely
a
disease
so
there
is
certainly
a
curiosity
a
desire
after
the
things
of
the
mind
simply
for
their
own
sakes
and
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
them
as
they
are
which
is
in
an
intelligent
being
natural
and
laudable
nay
and
the
very
desire
to
see
things
as
they
are
implies
a
balance
and
regulation
of
mind
which
is
not
often
attained
without
fruitful
effort
and
which
is
the
very
opposite
of
the
blind
and
diseased
impulse
of
mind
which
is
what
we
mean
to
blame
when
we
blame
curiosity
montesquieu
says
the
first
motive
which
ought
to
impel
us
to
study
is
the
desire
to
augment
the
excellence
of
our
nature
and
to
render
an
intelligent
being
yet
more
intelligent
this
is
the
true
ground
to
assign
for
the
genuine
scientific
passion
however
manifested
and
for
culture
viewed
simply
as
a
fruit
of
this
passion
and
it
is
a
worthy
ground
even
though
we
let
the
term
curiosity
stand
to
describe
it
but
there
is
of
culture
another
view
in
which
not
solely
the
scientific
passion
the
sheer
desire
to
see
things
as
they
are
natural
and
proper
in
an
intelligent
being
appears
as
the
ground
of
it
there
is
a
view
in
which
all
the
love
of
our
neighbour
the
impulses
towards
action
help
and
beneficence
the
desire
for
stopping
human
error
clearing
human
confusion
and
diminishing
the
sum
of
human
misery
the
noble
aspiration
to
leave
the
world
better
and
happier
than
we
found
it
motives
eminently
such
as
are
called
social
come
in
as
part
of
the
grounds
of
culture
and
the
main
and
part
culture
is
then
properly
described
not
as
having
its
origin
in
curiosity
but
as
having
its
origin
in
the
love
of
perfection
it
is
a
study
of
perfection
it
moves
by
the
force
not
merely
or
primarily
of
the
scientific
passion
for
pure
knowledge
but
also
of
the
moral
and
social
passion
for
doing
good
as
in
the
first
view
of
it
we
took
for
its
worthy
motto
montesquieu
words
to
render
an
intelligent
being
yet
more
intelligent
so
in
the
second
view
of
it
there
is
no
better
motto
which
it
can
have
than
these
words
of
bishop
wilson
to
make
reason
and
the
will
of
god
prevail
only
whereas
the
passion
for
doing
good
is
apt
to
be
overhasty
in
determining
what
reason
and
the
will
of
god
say
because
its
turn
is
for
acting
rather
than
thinking
and
it
wants
to
be
beginning
to
act
and
whereas
it
is
apt
to
take
its
own
conceptions
which
proceed
from
its
own
state
of
development
and
share
in
all
the
imperfections
and
immaturities
of
this
for
a
basis
of
action
what
distinguishes
culture
is
that
it
is
possessed
by
the
scientific
passion
as
well
as
by
the
passion
of
doing
good
that
it
has
worthy
notions
of
reason
and
the
will
of
god
and
does
not
readily
suffer
its
own
crude
conceptions
to
substitute
themselves
for
them
and
that
knowing
that
no
action
or
institution
can
be
salutary
and
stable
which
are
not
based
on
reason
and
the
will
of
god
it
is
not
so
bent
on
acting
and
instituting
even
with
the
great
aim
of
diminishing
human
error
and
misery
ever
before
its
thoughts
but
that
it
can
remember
that
acting
and
instituting
are
of
little
use
unless
we
know
how
and
what
we
ought
to
act
and
to
institute
this
culture
is
more
interesting
and
more
than
that
other
which
is
founded
solely
on
the
scientific
passion
for
knowing
but
it
needs
times
of
faith
and
ardour
times
when
the
intellectual
horizon
is
opening
and
widening
all
round
us
to
flourish
in
and
is
not
the
close
and
bounded
intellectual
horizon
within
which
we
have
long
lived
and
moved
now
lifting
up
and
are
not
new
lights
finding
free
passage
to
shine
in
upon
us
for
a
long
time
there
was
no
passage
for
them
to
make
their
way
in
upon
us
and
then
it
was
of
no
use
to
think
of
adapting
the
world
action
to
them
where
was
the
hope
of
making
reason
and
the
will
of
god
prevail
among
people
who
had
a
routine
which
they
had
christened
reason
and
the
will
of
god
in
which
they
were
inextricably
bound
and
beyond
which
they
had
no
power
of
looking
but
now
the
iron
force
of
adhesion
to
the
old
routine
social
political
religious
has
wonderfully
yielded
the
iron
force
of
exclusion
of
all
which
is
new
has
wonderfully
yielded
the
danger
now
is
not
that
people
should
obstinately
refuse
to
allow
anything
but
their
old
routine
to
pass
for
reason
and
the
will
of
god
but
either
that
they
should
allow
some
novelty
or
other
to
pass
for
these
too
easily
or
else
that
they
should
underrate
the
importance
of
them
altogether
and
think
it
enough
to
follow
action
for
its
own
sake
without
troubling
themselves
to
make
reason
and
the
will
of
god
prevail
therein
now
then
is
the
moment
for
culture
to
be
of
service
culture
which
believes
in
making
reason
and
the
will
of
god
prevail
believes
in
perfection
is
the
study
and
pursuit
of
perfection
and
is
no
longer
debarred
by
a
rigid
invincible
exclusion
of
whatever
is
new
from
getting
acceptance
for
its
ideas
simply
because
they
are
new
the
moment
this
view
of
culture
is
seized
the
moment
it
is
regarded
not
solely
as
the
endeavour
to
see
things
as
they
are
to
draw
towards
a
knowledge
of
the
universal
order
which
seems
to
be
intended
and
aimed
at
in
the
world
and
which
it
is
a
man
happiness
to
go
along
with
or
his
misery
to
go
counter
to
to
learn
in
short
the
will
of
god
the
moment
i
say
culture
is
considered
not
merely
as
the
endeavour
to
see
and
learn
this
but
as
the
endeavour
also
to
make
it
prevail
the
moral
social
and
beneficent
character
of
culture
becomes
manifest
the
mere
endeavour
to
see
and
learn
it
for
our
own
personal
satisfaction
is
indeed
a
commencement
for
making
it
prevail
a
preparing
the
way
for
this
which
always
serves
this
and
is
wrongly
therefore
stamped
with
blame
absolutely
in
itself
and
not
only
in
its
caricature
and
degeneration
but
perhaps
it
has
got
stamped
with
blame
and
disparaged
with
the
dubious
title
of
curiosity
because
in
comparison
with
this
wider
endeavour
of
such
great
and
plain
utility
it
looks
selfish
petty
and
unprofitable
and
religion
the
greatest
and
most
important
of
the
efforts
by
which
the
human
race
has
manifested
its
impulse
to
perfect
itself
religion
that
voice
of
the
deepest
human
experience
does
not
only
enjoin
and
sanction
the
aim
which
is
the
great
aim
of
culture
the
aim
of
setting
ourselves
to
ascertain
what
perfection
is
and
to
make
it
prevail
but
also
in
determining
generally
in
what
human
perfection
consists
religion
comes
to
a
conclusion
identical
with
that
which
culture
seeking
the
determination
of
this
question
through
all
the
voices
of
human
experience
which
have
been
heard
upon
it
art
science
poetry
philosophy
history
as
well
as
religion
in
order
to
give
a
greater
fulness
and
certainty
to
its
solution
likewise
reaches
religion
says
the
kingdom
of
god
is
within
you
and
culture
in
like
manner
places
human
perfection
in
an
internal
condition
in
the
growth
and
predominance
of
our
humanity
proper
as
distinguished
from
our
animality
in
the
efficaciousness
and
in
the
general
harmonious
expansion
of
those
gifts
of
thought
and
feeling
which
make
the
peculiar
dignity
wealth
and
happiness
of
human
nature
as
i
have
said
on
a
former
occasion
it
is
in
making
endless
additions
to
itself
in
the
endless
expansion
of
its
powers
in
endless
growth
in
wisdom
and
beauty
that
the
spirit
of
the
human
race
finds
its
ideal
to
reach
this
ideal
culture
is
an
indispensable
aid
and
that
is
the
true
value
of
culture
not
a
having
and
a
resting
but
a
growing
and
a
becoming
is
the
character
of
perfection
as
culture
conceives
it
and
here
too
it
coincides
with
religion
and
because
men
are
all
members
of
one
great
whole
and
the
sympathy
which
is
in
human
nature
will
not
allow
one
member
to
be
indifferent
to
the
rest
or
to
have
a
perfect
welfare
independent
of
the
rest
the
expansion
of
our
humanity
to
suit
the
idea
of
perfection
which
culture
forms
must
be
a
general
expansion
perfection
as
culture
conceives
it
is
not
possible
while
the
individual
remains
isolated
the
individual
is
obliged
under
pain
of
being
stunted
and
enfeebled
in
his
own
development
if
he
disobeys
to
carry
others
along
with
him
in
his
march
towards
perfection
to
be
continually
doing
all
he
can
to
enlarge
and
increase
the
volume
of
the
human
stream
sweeping
thitherward
and
here
once
more
it
lays
on
us
the
same
obligation
as
religion
which
says
as
bishop
wilson
has
admirably
put
it
that
to
promote
the
kingdom
of
god
is
to
increase
and
hasten
one
own
happiness
finally
perfection
as
culture
from
a
thorough
disinterested
study
of
human
nature
and
human
experience
learns
to
conceive
it
is
an
harmonious
expansion
of
all
the
powers
which
make
the
beauty
and
worth
of
human
nature
and
is
not
consistent
with
the
development
of
any
one
power
at
the
expense
of
the
rest
here
it
goes
beyond
religion
as
religion
is
generally
conceived
by
us
if
culture
then
is
a
study
of
perfection
and
of
harmonious
perfection
general
perfection
and
perfection
which
consists
in
becoming
something
rather
than
in
having
something
in
an
inward
condition
of
the
mind
and
spirit
not
in
an
outward
set
of
circumstances
it
is
clear
that
culture
instead
of
being
the
frivolous
and
useless
thing
which
mr
bright
and
frederic
harrison
and
many
other
liberals
are
apt
to
call
it
has
a
very
important
function
to
fulfil
for
mankind
and
this
function
is
particularly
important
in
our
modern
world
of
which
the
whole
civilisation
is
to
a
much
greater
degree
than
the
civilisation
of
greece
and
rome
mechanical
and
external
and
tends
constantly
to
become
more
so
but
above
all
in
our
own
country
has
culture
a
weighty
part
to
perform
because
here
that
mechanical
character
which
civilisation
tends
to
take
everywhere
is
shown
in
the
most
eminent
degree
indeed
nearly
all
the
characters
of
perfection
as
culture
teaches
us
to
fix
them
meet
in
this
country
with
some
powerful
tendency
which
thwarts
them
and
sets
them
at
defiance
the
idea
of
perfection
as
an
inward
condition
of
the
mind
and
spirit
is
at
variance
with
the
mechanical
and
material
civilisation
in
esteem
with
us
and
nowhere
as
i
have
said
so
much
in
esteem
as
with
us
the
idea
of
perfection
as
a
general
expansion
of
the
human
family
is
at
variance
with
our
strong
individualism
our
hatred
of
all
limits
to
the
unrestrained
swing
of
the
individual
personality
our
maxim
of
every
man
for
himself
the
idea
of
perfection
as
an
harmonious
expansion
of
human
nature
is
at
variance
with
our
want
of
flexibility
with
our
inaptitude
for
seeing
more
than
one
side
of
a
thing
with
our
intense
energetic
absorption
in
the
particular
pursuit
we
happen
to
be
following
so
culture
has
a
rough
task
to
achieve
in
this
country
and
its
preachers
have
and
are
likely
long
to
have
a
hard
time
of
it
and
they
will
much
oftener
be
regarded
for
a
great
while
to
come
as
elegant
or
spurious
jeremiahs
than
as
friends
and
benefactors
that
however
will
not
prevent
their
doing
in
the
end
good
service
if
they
persevere
and
meanwhile
the
mode
of
action
they
have
to
pursue
and
the
sort
of
habits
they
must
fight
against
should
be
made
quite
clear
to
every
one
who
may
be
willing
to
look
at
the
matter
attentively
and
dispassionately
faith
in
machinery
is
i
said
our
besetting
danger
often
in
machinery
most
absurdly
disproportioned
to
the
end
which
this
machinery
if
it
is
to
do
any
good
at
all
is
to
serve
but
always
in
machinery
as
if
it
had
a
value
in
and
for
itself
what
is
freedom
but
machinery
what
is
population
but
machinery
what
is
coal
but
machinery
what
are
railroads
but
machinery
what
is
wealth
but
machinery
what
are
religious
organisations
but
machinery
now
almost
every
voice
in
england
is
accustomed
to
speak
of
these
things
as
if
they
were
precious
ends
in
themselves
and
therefore
had
some
of
the
characters
of
perfection
indisputably
joined
to
them
i
have
once
before
noticed
roebuck
stock
argument
for
proving
the
greatness
and
happiness
of
england
as
she
is
and
for
quite
stopping
the
mouths
of
all
gainsayers
roebuck
is
never
weary
of
reiterating
this
argument
of
his
so
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
be
weary
of
noticing
it
may
not
every
man
in
england
say
what
he
likes
mr
roebuck
perpetually
asks
and
that
he
thinks
is
quite
sufficient
and
when
every
man
may
say
what
he
likes
our
aspirations
ought
to
be
satisfied
but
the
aspirations
of
culture
which
is
the
study
of
perfection
are
not
satisfied
unless
what
men
say
when
they
may
say
what
they
like
is
worth
saying
has
good
in
it
and
more
good
than
bad
in
the
same
way
the
times
replying
to
some
foreign
strictures
on
the
dress
looks
and
behaviour
of
the
english
abroad
urges
that
the
english
ideal
is
that
every
one
should
be
free
to
do
and
to
look
just
as
he
likes
but
culture
indefatigably
tries
not
to
make
what
each
raw
person
may
like
the
rule
by
which
he
fashions
himself
but
to
draw
ever
nearer
to
a
sense
of
what
is
indeed
beautiful
graceful
and
becoming
and
to
get
the
raw
person
to
like
that
and
in
the
same
way
with
respect
to
railroads
and
coal
every
one
must
have
observed
the
strange
language
current
during
the
late
discussions
as
to
the
possible
failure
of
our
supplies
of
coal
our
coal
thousands
of
people
were
saying
is
the
real
basis
of
our
national
greatness
if
our
coal
runs
short
there
is
an
end
of
the
greatness
of
england
but
what
is
greatness
culture
makes
us
ask
greatness
is
a
spiritual
condition
worthy
to
excite
love
interest
and
admiration
and
the
outward
proof
of
possessing
greatness
is
that
we
excite
love
interest
and
admiration
if
england
were
swallowed
up
by
the
sea
which
of
the
two
a
hundred
years
hence
would
most
excite
the
love
interest
and
admiration
of
mankind
would
most
therefore
show
the
evidences
of
having
possessed
greatness
the
england
of
the
last
twenty
years
or
the
england
of
elizabeth
of
a
time
of
splendid
spiritual
effort
but
when
our
coal
and
our
industrial
operations
depending
on
coal
were
very
little
developed
well
then
what
an
unsound
habit
of
mind
it
must
be
which
makes
us
talk
of
things
like
coal
or
iron
as
constituting
the
greatness
of
england
and
how
salutary
a
friend
is
culture
bent
on
seeing
things
as
they
are
and
thus
dissipating
delusions
of
this
kind
and
fixing
standards
of
perfection
that
are
real
wealth
again
that
end
to
which
our
prodigious
works
for
material
advantage
are
directed
the
commonest
of
commonplaces
tells
us
how
men
are
always
apt
to
regard
wealth
as
a
precious
end
in
itself
and
certainly
they
have
never
been
so
apt
thus
to
regard
it
as
they
are
in
england
at
the
present
time
never
did
people
believe
anything
more
firmly
than
nine
englishmen
out
of
ten
at
the
present
day
believe
that
our
greatness
and
welfare
are
proved
by
our
being
so
very
rich
now
the
use
of
culture
is
that
it
helps
us
by
means
of
its
spiritual
standard
of
perfection
to
regard
wealth
as
but
machinery
and
not
only
to
say
as
a
matter
of
words
that
we
regard
wealth
as
but
machinery
but
really
to
perceive
and
feel
that
it
is
so
if
it
were
not
for
this
purging
effect
wrought
upon
our
minds
by
culture
the
whole
world
the
future
as
well
as
the
present
would
inevitably
belong
to
the
philistines
the
people
who
believe
most
that
our
greatness
and
welfare
are
proved
by
our
being
very
rich
and
who
most
give
their
lives
and
thoughts
to
becoming
rich
are
just
the
very
people
whom
we
call
the
philistines
culture
says
consider
these
people
then
their
way
of
life
their
habits
their
manners
the
very
tones
of
their
voice
look
at
them
attentively
observe
the
literature
they
read
the
things
which
give
them
pleasure
the
words
which
come
forth
out
of
their
mouths
the
thoughts
which
make
the
furniture
of
their
minds
would
any
amount
of
wealth
be
worth
having
with
the
condition
that
one
was
to
become
just
like
these
people
by
having
it
and
thus
culture
begets
a
dissatisfaction
which
is
of
the
highest
possible
value
in
stemming
the
common
tide
of
men
thoughts
in
a
wealthy
and
industrial
community
and
which
saves
the
future
as
one
may
hope
from
being
vulgarised
even
if
it
can
not
save
the
present
population
again
and
bodily
health
and
vigour
are
things
which
are
nowhere
treated
in
such
an
unintelligent
misleading
exaggerated
way
as
in
england
both
are
really
machinery
yet
how
many
people
all
around
us
do
we
see
rest
in
them
and
fail
to
look
beyond
them
why
i
have
heard
people
fresh
from
reading
certain
articles
of
the
times
on
the
returns
of
marriages
and
births
in
this
country
who
would
talk
of
large
families
in
quite
a
solemn
strain
as
if
they
had
something
in
itself
beautiful
elevating
and
meritorious
in
them
as
if
the
british
philistine
would
have
only
to
present
himself
before
the
great
judge
with
his
twelve
children
in
order
to
be
received
among
the
sheep
as
a
matter
of
right
but
bodily
health
and
vigour
it
may
be
said
are
not
to
be
classed
with
wealth
and
population
as
mere
machinery
they
have
a
more
real
and
essential
value
true
but
only
as
they
are
more
intimately
connected
with
a
perfect
spiritual
condition
than
wealth
or
population
are
the
moment
we
disjoin
them
from
the
idea
of
a
perfect
spiritual
condition
and
pursue
them
as
we
do
pursue
them
for
their
own
sake
and
as
ends
in
themselves
our
worship
of
them
becomes
as
mere
worship
of
machinery
as
our
worship
of
wealth
or
population
and
as
unintelligent
and
vulgarising
a
worship
as
that
is
every
one
with
anything
like
an
adequate
idea
of
human
perfection
has
distinctly
marked
this
subordination
to
higher
and
spiritual
ends
of
the
cultivation
of
bodily
vigour
and
activity
bodily
exercise
profiteth
little
but
godliness
is
profitable
unto
all
things
says
the
author
of
the
epistle
to
timothy
and
the
utilitarian
franklin
says
just
as
explicitly
eat
and
drink
such
an
exact
quantity
as
suits
the
constitution
of
thy
body
in
reference
to
the
services
of
the
mind
but
the
point
of
view
of
culture
keeping
the
mark
of
human
perfection
simply
and
broadly
in
view
and
not
assigning
to
this
perfection
as
religion
or
utilitarianism
assign
to
it
a
special
and
limited
character
this
point
of
view
i
say
of
culture
is
best
given
by
these
words
of
epictetus
it
is
a
sign
of
aphuia
says
he
that
is
of
a
nature
not
finely
tempered
to
give
yourselves
up
to
things
which
relate
to
the
body
to
make
for
instance
a
great
fuss
about
exercise
a
great
fuss
about
eating
a
great
fuss
about
drinking
a
great
fuss
about
walking
a
great
fuss
about
riding
all
these
things
ought
to
be
done
merely
by
the
way
the
formation
of
the
spirit
and
character
must
be
our
real
concern
this
is
admirable
and
indeed
the
greek
words
aphuia
euphuia
a
finely
tempered
nature
a
coarsely
tempered
nature
give
exactly
the
notion
of
perfection
as
culture
brings
us
to
conceive
of
it
a
perfection
in
which
the
characters
of
beauty
and
intelligence
are
both
present
which
unites
the
two
noblest
of
things
as
swift
who
of
one
of
the
two
at
any
rate
had
himself
all
too
little
most
happily
calls
them
in
his
battle
of
the
books
the
two
noblest
of
things
sweetness
and
light
the
is
the
man
who
tends
towards
sweetness
and
light
the
is
precisely
our
philistine
the
immense
spiritual
significance
of
the
greeks
is
due
to
their
having
been
inspired
with
this
central
and
happy
idea
of
the
essential
character
of
human
perfection
and
mr
misconception
of
culture
as
a
smattering
of
greek
and
latin
conies
itself
after
all
from
this
wonderful
significance
of
the
greeks
having
affected
the
very
machinery
of
our
education
and
is
in
itself
a
kind
of
homage
to
it
it
is
by
thus
making
sweetness
and
light
to
be
characters
of
perfection
that
culture
is
of
like
spirit
with
poetry
follows
one
law
with
poetry
i
have
called
religion
a
more
important
manifestation
of
human
nature
than
poetry
because
it
has
worked
on
a
broader
scale
for
perfection
and
with
greater
masses
of
men
but
the
idea
of
beauty
and
of
a
human
nature
perfect
on
all
its
sides
which
is
the
dominant
idea
of
poetry
is
a
true
and
invaluable
idea
though
it
has
not
yet
had
the
success
that
the
idea
of
conquering
the
obvious
faults
of
our
animality
and
of
a
human
nature
perfect
on
the
moral
side
which
is
the
dominant
idea
of
religion
has
been
enabled
to
have
and
it
is
destined
adding
to
itself
the
religious
idea
of
a
devout
energy
to
transform
and
govern
the
other
the
best
art
and
poetry
of
the
greeks
in
which
religion
and
poetry
are
one
in
which
the
idea
of
beauty
and
of
a
human
nature
perfect
on
all
sides
adds
to
itself
a
religious
and
devout
energy
and
works
in
the
strength
of
that
is
on
this
account
of
such
surpassing
interest
and
instructiveness
for
us
though
it
was
as
having
regard
to
the
human
race
in
general
and
indeed
having
regard
to
the
greeks
themselves
we
must
own
a
premature
attempt
an
attempt
which
for
success
needed
the
moral
and
religious
fibre
in
humanity
to
be
more
braced
and
developed
than
it
had
yet
been
but
greece
did
not
err
in
having
the
idea
of
beauty
harmony
and
complete
human
perfection
so
present
and
paramount
it
is
impossible
to
have
this
idea
too
present
and
paramount
only
the
moral
fibre
must
be
braced
too
and
we
because
we
have
braced
the
moral
fibre
are
not
on
that
account
in
the
right
way
if
at
the
same
time
the
idea
of
beauty
harmony
and
complete
human
perfection
is
wanting
or
misapprehended
amongst
us
and
evidently
it
is
wanting
or
misapprehended
at
present
and
when
we
rely
as
we
do
on
our
religious
organisations
which
in
themselves
do
not
and
can
not
give
us
this
idea
and
think
we
have
done
enough
if
we
make
them
spread
and
prevail
then
i
say
we
fall
into
our
common
fault
of
overvaluing
machinery
nothing
is
more
common
than
for
people
to
confound
the
inward
peace
and
satisfaction
which
follows
the
subduing
of
the
obvious
faults
of
our
animality
with
what
i
may
call
absolute
inward
peace
and
satisfaction
the
peace
and
satisfaction
which
are
reached
as
we
draw
near
to
complete
spiritual
perfection
and
not
merely
to
moral
perfection
or
rather
to
relative
moral
perfection
no
people
in
the
world
have
done
more
and
struggled
more
to
attain
this
relative
moral
perfection
than
our
english
race
has
for
no
people
in
the
world
has
the
command
to
resist
the
devil
to
overcome
the
wicked
one
in
the
nearest
and
most
obvious
sense
of
those
words
had
such
a
pressing
force
and
reality
and
we
have
had
our
reward
not
only
in
the
great
worldly
prosperity
which
our
obedience
to
this
command
has
brought
us
but
also
and
far
more
in
great
inward
peace
and
satisfaction
but
to
me
few
things
are
more
pathetic
than
to
see
people
on
the
strength
of
the
inward
peace
and
satisfaction
which
their
rudimentary
efforts
towards
perfection
have
brought
them
use
concerning
their
incomplete
perfection
and
the
religious
organisations
within
which
they
have
found
it
language
which
properly
applies
only
to
complete
perfection
and
is
a
echo
of
the
human
soul
prophecy
of
it
religion
itself
i
need
hardly
say
supplies
in
abundance
this
grand
language
which
is
really
the
severest
criticism
of
such
an
incomplete
perfection
as
alone
we
have
yet
reached
through
our
religious
organisations
the
impulse
of
the
english
race
towards
moral
development
and
conquest
has
nowhere
so
powerfully
manifested
itself
as
in
puritanism
nowhere
has
puritanism
found
so
adequate
an
expression
as
in
the
religious
organisation
of
the
independents
the
modern
independents
have
a
newspaper
the
nonconformist
written
with
great
sincerity
and
ability
the
motto
the
standard
the
profession
of
faith
which
this
organ
of
theirs
carries
aloft
is
the
dissidence
of
dissent
and
the
protestantism
of
the
protestant
religion
there
is
sweetness
and
light
and
an
ideal
of
complete
harmonious
human
perfection
one
need
not
go
to
culture
and
poetry
to
find
language
to
judge
it
religion
with
its
instinct
for
perfection
supplies
language
to
judge
it
finally
be
of
one
mind
united
in
feeling
says
peter
there
is
an
ideal
which
judges
the
puritan
ideal
the
dissidence
of
dissent
and
the
protestantism
of
the
protestant
religion
and
religious
organisations
like
this
are
what
people
believe
in
rest
in
would
give
their
lives
for
such
i
say
is
the
wonderful
virtue
of
even
the
beginnings
of
perfection
of
having
conquered
even
the
plain
faults
of
our
animality
that
the
religious
organisation
which
has
helped
us
to
do
it
can
seem
to
us
something
precious
salutary
and
to
be
propagated
even
when
it
wears
such
a
brand
of
imperfection
on
its
forehead
as
this
and
men
have
got
such
a
habit
of
giving
to
the
language
of
religion
a
special
application
of
making
it
a
mere
jargon
that
for
the
condemnation
which
religion
itself
passes
on
the
shortcomings
of
their
religious
organisations
they
have
no
ear
they
are
sure
to
cheat
themselves
and
to
explain
this
condemnation
away
they
can
only
be
reached
by
the
criticism
which
culture
like
poetry
speaking
a
language
not
to
be
sophisticated
and
resolutely
testing
these
organisations
by
the
ideal
of
a
human
perfection
complete
on
all
sides
applies
to
them
but
men
of
culture
and
poetry
it
will
be
said
are
again
and
again
failing
and
failing
conspicuously
in
the
necessary
first
stage
to
perfection
in
the
subduing
of
the
great
obvious
faults
of
our
animality
which
it
is
the
glory
of
these
religious
organisations
to
have
helped
us
to
subdue
true
they
do
often
so
fail
they
have
often
been
without
the
virtues
as
well
as
the
faults
of
the
puritan
it
has
been
one
of
their
dangers
that
they
so
felt
the
faults
that
they
too
much
neglected
the
practice
of
his
virtues
i
will
not
however
exculpate
them
at
the
puritan
expense
they
have
often
failed
in
morality
and
morality
is
indispensable
they
have
been
punished
for
their
failure
as
the
puritan
has
been
rewarded
for
his
performance
they
have
been
punished
wherein
they
erred
but
their
ideal
of
beauty
and
sweetness
and
light
and
a
human
nature
complete
on
all
its
sides
remains
the
true
ideal
of
perfection
still
just
as
the
puritan
ideal
of
perfection
remains
narrow
and
inadequate
although
for
what
he
did
well
he
has
been
richly
rewarded
notwithstanding
the
mighty
results
of
the
pilgrim
voyage
they
and
their
standard
of
perfection
are
rightly
judged
when
we
figure
to
ourselves
shakspeare
or
virgil
souls
in
whom
sweetness
and
light
and
all
that
in
human
nature
is
most
humane
were
eminent
accompanying
them
on
their
voyage
and
think
what
intolerable
company
shakspeare
and
virgil
would
have
found
them
in
the
same
way
let
us
judge
the
religious
organisations
which
we
see
all
around
us
do
not
let
us
deny
the
good
and
the
happiness
which
they
have
accomplished
but
do
not
let
us
fail
to
see
clearly
that
their
idea
of
human
perfection
is
narrow
and
inadequate
and
that
the
dissidence
of
dissent
and
the
protestantism
of
the
protestant
religion
will
never
bring
humanity
to
its
true
goal
as
i
said
with
regard
to
wealth
let
us
look
at
the
life
of
those
who
live
in
and
for
it
so
i
say
with
regard
to
the
religious
organisations
look
at
the
life
imaged
in
such
a
newspaper
as
the
nonconformist
a
life
of
jealousy
of
the
establishment
disputes
openings
of
chapels
sermons
and
then
think
of
it
as
an
ideal
of
a
human
life
completing
itself
on
all
sides
and
aspiring
with
all
its
organs
after
sweetness
light
and
perfection
another
newspaper
representing
like
the
nonconformist
one
of
the
religious
organisations
of
this
country
was
a
short
time
ago
giving
an
account
of
the
crowd
at
epsom
on
the
derby
day
and
of
all
the
vice
and
hideousness
which
was
to
be
seen
in
that
crowd
and
then
the
writer
turned
suddenly
round
upon
professor
huxley
and
asked
him
how
he
proposed
to
cure
all
this
vice
and
hideousness
without
religion
i
confess
i
felt
disposed
to
ask
the
asker
this
question
and
how
do
you
propose
to
cure
it
with
such
a
religion
as
yours
how
is
the
ideal
of
a
life
so
unlovely
so
unattractive
so
narrow
so
far
removed
from
a
true
and
satisfying
ideal
of
human
perfection
as
is
the
life
of
your
religious
organisation
as
you
yourself
image
it
to
conquer
and
transform
all
this
vice
and
hideousness
indeed
the
strongest
plea
for
the
study
of
perfection
as
pursued
by
culture
the
clearest
proof
of
the
actual
inadequacy
of
the
idea
of
perfection
held
by
the
religious
organisations
expressing
as
i
have
said
the
most
effort
which
the
human
race
has
yet
made
after
perfection
is
to
be
found
in
the
state
of
our
life
and
society
with
these
in
possession
of
it
and
having
been
in
possession
of
it
i
know
not
how
many
hundred
years
we
are
all
of
us
included
in
some
religious
organisation
or
other
we
all
call
ourselves
in
the
sublime
and
aspiring
language
of
religion
which
i
have
before
noticed
children
of
god
children
of
god
it
is
an
immense
pretension
and
how
are
we
to
justify
it
by
the
works
which
we
do
and
the
words
which
we
speak
and
the
work
which
we
collective
children
of
god
do
our
grand
centre
of
life
our
city
which
we
have
builded
for
us
to
dwell
in
is
london
london
with
its
unutterable
external
hideousness
and
with
its
internal
canker
of
public
egestas
privatim
opulentia
to
use
the
words
which
sallust
puts
into
cato
mouth
about
rome
unequalled
in
the
world
the
word
again
which
we
children
of
god
speak
the
voice
which
most
hits
our
collective
thought
the
newspaper
with
the
largest
circulation
in
england
nay
with
the
largest
circulation
in
the
whole
world
is
the
daily
telegraph
i
say
that
when
our
religious
organisations
which
i
admit
to
express
the
most
considerable
effort
after
perfection
that
our
race
has
yet
made
land
us
in
no
better
result
than
this
it
is
high
time
to
examine
carefully
their
idea
of
perfection
to
see
whether
it
does
not
leave
out
of
account
sides
and
forces
of
human
nature
which
we
might
turn
to
great
use
whether
it
would
not
be
more
operative
if
it
were
more
complete
and
i
say
that
the
english
reliance
on
our
religious
organisations
and
on
their
ideas
of
human
perfection
just
as
they
stand
is
like
our
reliance
on
freedom
on
muscular
christianity
on
population
on
coal
on
wealth
mere
belief
in
machinery
and
unfruitful
and
that
it
is
wholesomely
counteracted
by
culture
bent
on
seeing
things
as
they
are
and
on
drawing
the
human
race
onwards
to
a
more
complete
perfection
culture
however
shows
its
love
of
perfection
its
desire
simply
to
make
reason
and
the
will
of
god
prevail
its
freedom
from
fanaticism
by
its
attitude
towards
all
this
machinery
even
while
it
insists
that
it
is
machinery
fanatics
seeing
the
mischief
men
do
themselves
by
their
blind
belief
in
some
machinery
or
other
whether
it
is
wealth
and
industrialism
or
whether
it
is
the
cultivation
of
bodily
strength
and
activity
or
whether
it
is
a
political
organisation
or
whether
it
is
a
religious
organisation
oppose
with
might
and
main
the
tendency
to
this
or
that
political
and
religious
organisation
or
to
games
and
athletic
exercises
or
to
wealth
and
industrialism
and
try
violently
to
stop
it
but
the
flexibility
which
sweetness
and
light
give
and
which
is
one
of
the
rewards
of
culture
pursued
in
good
faith
enables
a
man
to
see
that
a
tendency
may
be
necessary
and
even
as
a
preparation
for
something
in
the
future
salutary
and
yet
that
the
generations
or
individuals
who
obey
this
tendency
are
sacrificed
to
it
that
they
fall
short
of
the
hope
of
perfection
by
following
it
and
that
its
mischiefs
are
to
be
criticised
lest
it
should
take
too
firm
a
hold
and
last
after
it
has
served
its
purpose
gladstone
well
pointed
out
in
a
speech
at
paris
and
others
have
pointed
out
the
same
thing
how
necessary
is
the
present
great
movement
towards
wealth
and
industrialism
in
order
to
lay
broad
foundations
of
material
for
the
society
of
the
future
the
worst
of
these
justifications
is
that
they
are
generally
addressed
to
the
very
people
engaged
body
and
soul
in
the
movement
in
question
at
all
events
that
they
are
always
seized
with
the
greatest
avidity
by
these
people
and
taken
by
them
as
quite
justifying
their
life
and
that
thus
they
tend
to
harden
them
in
their
sins
now
culture
admits
the
necessity
of
the
movement
towards
and
exaggerated
industrialism
readily
allows
that
the
future
may
derive
benefit
from
it
but
insists
at
the
same
time
that
the
passing
generations
of
industrialists
forming
for
the
most
part
the
stout
main
body
of
philistinism
are
sacrificed
to
it
in
the
same
way
the
result
of
all
the
games
and
sports
which
occupy
the
passing
generation
of
boys
and
young
men
may
be
the
establishment
of
a
better
and
sounder
physical
type
for
the
future
to
work
with
culture
does
not
set
itself
against
the
games
and
sports
it
congratulates
the
future
and
hopes
it
will
make
a
good
use
of
its
improved
physical
basis
but
it
points
out
that
our
passing
generation
of
boys
and
young
men
is
meantime
sacrificed
puritanism
was
necessary
to
develop
the
moral
fibre
of
the
english
race
nonconformity
to
break
the
yoke
of
ecclesiastical
domination
over
men
minds
and
to
prepare
the
way
for
freedom
of
thought
in
the
distant
future
still
culture
points
out
that
the
harmonious
perfection
of
generations
of
puritans
and
nonconformists
have
been
in
consequence
sacrificed
freedom
of
speech
is
necessary
for
the
society
of
the
future
but
the
young
lions
of
the
daily
telegraph
in
the
meanwhile
are
sacrificed
a
voice
for
every
man
in
his
country
government
is
necessary
for
the
society
of
the
future
but
meanwhile
beales
and
bradlaugh
are
sacrificed
oxford
the
oxford
of
the
past
has
many
faults
and
she
has
heavily
paid
for
them
in
defeat
in
isolation
in
want
of
hold
upon
the
modern
world
yet
we
in
oxford
brought
up
amidst
the
beauty
and
sweetness
of
that
beautiful
place
have
not
failed
to
seize
one
truth
the
truth
that
beauty
and
sweetness
are
essential
characters
of
a
complete
human
perfection
when
i
insist
on
this
i
am
all
in
the
faith
and
tradition
of
oxford
i
say
boldly
that
this
our
sentiment
for
beauty
and
sweetness
our
sentiment
against
hideousness
and
rawness
has
been
at
the
bottom
of
our
attachment
to
so
many
beaten
causes
of
our
opposition
to
so
many
triumphant
movements
and
the
sentiment
is
true
and
has
never
been
wholly
defeated
and
has
shown
its
power
even
in
its
defeat
we
have
not
won
our
political
battles
we
have
not
carried
our
main
points
we
have
not
stopped
our
adversaries
advance
we
have
not
marched
victoriously
with
the
modern
world
but
we
have
told
silently
upon
the
mind
of
the
country
we
have
prepared
currents
of
feeling
which
sap
our
adversaries
position
when
it
seems
gained
we
have
kept
up
our
own
communications
with
the
future
look
at
the
course
of
the
great
movement
which
shook
oxford
to
its
centre
some
thirty
years
ago
it
was
directed
as
any
one
who
reads
newman
apology
may
see
against
what
in
one
word
maybe
called
liberalism
liberalism
prevailed
it
was
the
appointed
force
to
do
the
work
of
the
hour
it
was
necessary
it
was
inevitable
that
it
should
prevail
the
oxford
movement
was
broken
it
failed
our
wrecks
are
scattered
on
every
shore
quae
regio
in
terris
nostri
non
plena
laboris
but
what
was
it
this
liberalism
as
newman
saw
it
and
as
it
really
broke
the
oxford
movement
it
was
the
great
liberalism
which
had
for
the
cardinal
points
of
its
belief
the
reform
bill
of
and
local
in
politics
in
the
social
sphere
unrestricted
competition
and
the
making
of
large
industrial
fortunes
in
the
religious
sphere
the
dissidence
of
dissent
and
the
protestantism
of
the
protestant
religion
i
do
not
say
that
other
and
more
intelligent
forces
than
this
were
not
opposed
to
the
oxford
movement
but
this
was
the
force
which
really
beat
it
this
was
the
force
which
newman
felt
himself
fighting
with
this
was
the
force
which
till
only
the
other
day
seemed
to
be
the
paramount
force
in
this
country
and
to
be
in
possession
of
the
future
this
was
the
force
whose
achievements
fill
lowe
with
such
inexpressible
admiration
and
whose
rule
he
was
so
to
see
threatened
and
where
is
this
great
force
of
philistinism
now
it
is
thrust
into
the
second
rank
it
is
become
a
power
of
yesterday
it
has
lost
the
future
a
new
power
has
suddenly
appeared
a
power
which
it
is
impossible
yet
to
judge
fully
but
which
is
certainly
a
wholly
different
force
from
liberalism
different
in
its
cardinal
points
of
belief
different
in
its
tendencies
in
every
sphere
it
loves
and
admires
neither
the
legislation
of
parliaments
nor
the
local
government
of
vestries
nor
the
unrestricted
competition
of
industrialists
nor
the
dissidence
of
class
dissent
and
the
protestantism
of
protestant
religion
i
am
not
now
praising
this
new
force
or
saying
that
its
own
ideals
are
better
all
i
say
is
that
they
are
wholly
different
and
who
will
estimate
how
much
the
currents
of
feeling
created
by
newman
movement
the
keen
desire
for
beauty
and
sweetness
which
it
nourished
the
deep
aversion
it
manifested
to
the
hardness
and
vulgarity
of
liberalism
the
strong
light
it
turned
on
the
hideous
and
grotesque
illusions
of
protestantism
who
will
estimate
how
much
all
these
contributed
to
swell
the
tide
of
secret
dissatisfaction
which
has
mined
the
ground
under
the
confident
liberalism
of
the
last
thirty
years
and
has
prepared
the
way
for
its
sudden
collapse
and
supersession
it
is
in
this
manner
that
the
sentiment
of
oxford
for
beauty
and
sweetness
conquers
and
in
this
manner
long
may
it
continue
to
conquer
in
this
manner
it
works
to
the
same
end
as
culture
and
there
is
plenty
of
work
for
it
yet
to
do
i
have
said
that
the
new
and
more
democratic
force
which
is
now
superseding
our
old
liberalism
can
not
yet
be
rightly
judged
it
has
its
main
tendencies
still
to
form
we
hear
promises
of
its
giving
us
administrative
reform
law
reform
reform
of
education
and
i
know
not
what
but
those
promises
come
rather
from
its
advocates
wishing
to
make
a
good
plea
for
it
and
to
justify
it
for
superseding
class
liberalism
than
from
clear
tendencies
which
it
has
itself
yet
developed
but
meanwhile
it
has
plenty
of
friends
against
whom
culture
may
with
advantage
continue
to
uphold
steadily
its
ideal
of
human
perfection
that
this
is
an
inward
spiritual
activity
having
for
its
characters
increased
sweetness
increased
light
increased
life
increased
sympathy
mr
bright
who
has
a
foot
in
both
worlds
the
world
of
liberalism
and
the
world
of
democracy
but
who
brings
most
of
his
ideas
from
the
world
of
liberalism
in
which
he
was
bred
always
inclines
to
inculcate
that
faith
in
machinery
to
which
as
we
have
seen
englishmen
are
so
prone
and
which
has
been
the
bane
of
liberalism
he
complains
with
a
sorrowful
indignation
of
people
who
appear
to
have
no
proper
estimate
of
the
value
of
the
franchise
he
leads
his
disciples
to
believe
what
the
englishman
is
always
too
ready
to
believe
that
the
having
a
vote
like
the
having
a
large
family
or
a
large
business
or
large
muscles
has
in
itself
some
edifying
and
perfecting
effect
upon
human
nature
or
else
he
cries
out
to
the
democracy
the
men
as
he
calls
them
upon
whose
shoulders
the
greatness
of
england
rests
he
cries
out
to
them
see
what
you
have
done
i
look
over
this
country
and
see
the
cities
you
have
built
the
railroads
you
have
made
the
manufactures
you
have
produced
the
cargoes
which
freight
the
ships
of
the
greatest
mercantile
navy
the
world
has
ever
seen
i
see
that
you
have
converted
by
your
labours
what
was
once
a
wilderness
these
islands
into
a
fruitful
garden
i
know
that
you
have
created
this
wealth
and
are
a
nation
whose
name
is
a
word
of
power
throughout
all
the
world
why
this
is
just
the
very
style
of
laudation
with
which
roebuck
or
lowe
debauch
the
minds
of
the
middle
classes
and
make
such
philistines
of
them
it
is
the
same
fashion
of
teaching
a
man
to
value
himself
not
on
what
he
is
not
on
his
progress
in
sweetness
and
light
but
on
the
number
of
the
railroads
he
has
constructed
or
the
bigness
of
the
tabernacle
he
has
built
only
the
middle
classes
are
told
they
have
done
it
all
with
their
energy
and
capital
and
the
democracy
are
told
they
have
done
it
all
with
their
hands
and
sinews
but
teaching
the
democracy
to
put
its
trust
in
achievements
of
this
kind
is
merely
training
them
to
be
philistines
to
take
the
place
of
the
philistines
whom
they
are
superseding
and
they
too
like
the
middle
class
will
be
encouraged
to
sit
down
at
the
banquet
of
the
future
without
having
on
a
wedding
garment
and
nothing
excellent
can
then
come
from
them
those
who
know
their
besetting
faults
those
who
have
watched
them
and
listened
to
them
or
those
who
will
read
the
instructive
account
recently
given
of
them
by
one
of
themselves
the
journeyman
engineer
will
agree
that
the
idea
which
culture
sets
before
us
of
perfection
an
increased
spiritual
activity
having
for
its
characters
increased
sweetness
increased
light
increased
life
increased
sympathy
is
an
idea
which
the
new
democracy
needs
far
more
than
the
idea
of
the
blessedness
of
the
franchise
or
the
wonderfulness
of
their
own
industrial
performances
other
friends
of
this
new
power
are
for
leading
it
not
in
the
old
ruts
of
philistinism
but
in
ways
which
are
naturally
alluring
to
the
feet
of
democracy
though
in
this
country
they
are
novel
and
untried
ways
i
may
call
them
the
ways
of
jacobinism
violent
indignation
with
the
past
abstract
systems
of
renovation
applied
wholesale
a
new
doctrine
drawn
up
in
black
and
white
for
elaborating
down
to
the
very
smallest
details
a
rational
society
for
the
future
these
are
the
ways
of
jacobinism
frederic
harrison
and
other
disciples
of
comte
one
of
them
congreve
is
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
and
i
am
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
publicly
expressing
my
respect
for
his
talents
and
character
are
among
the
friends
of
democracy
who
are
for
leading
it
in
paths
of
this
kind
frederic
harrison
is
very
hostile
to
culture
and
from
a
natural
enough
motive
for
culture
is
the
eternal
opponent
of
the
two
things
which
are
the
signal
marks
of
jacobinism
fierceness
and
its
addiction
to
an
abstract
system
culture
is
always
assigning
to
and
systems
a
smaller
share
in
the
bent
of
human
destiny
than
their
friends
like
a
current
in
minds
sets
towards
new
ideas
people
are
dissatisfied
with
their
old
narrow
stock
of
philistine
ideas
ideas
or
any
other
and
some
man
some
bentham
or
comte
who
has
the
real
merit
of
having
early
and
strongly
felt
and
helped
the
new
current
but
who
brings
plenty
of
narrownesses
and
mistakes
of
his
own
into
his
feeling
and
help
of
it
is
credited
with
being
the
author
of
the
whole
current
the
fit
person
to
be
entrusted
with
its
regulation
and
to
guide
the
human
race
the
excellent
german
historian
of
the
mythology
of
rome
preller
relating
the
introduction
at
rome
under
the
tarquins
of
the
worship
of
apollo
the
god
of
light
healing
and
reconciliation
observes
that
it
was
not
so
much
the
tarquins
who
brought
to
rome
the
new
worship
of
apollo
as
a
current
in
the
mind
of
the
roman
people
which
set
powerfully
at
that
time
towards
a
new
worship
of
this
kind
and
away
from
the
old
run
of
latin
and
sabine
religious
ideas
in
a
similar
way
culture
directs
our
attention
to
the
current
in
human
affairs
and
to
its
continual
working
and
will
not
let
us
rivet
our
faith
upon
any
one
man
and
his
doings
it
makes
us
see
not
only
his
good
side
but
also
how
much
in
him
was
of
necessity
limited
and
transient
nay
it
even
feels
a
pleasure
a
sense
of
an
increased
freedom
and
of
an
ampler
future
in
so
doing
i
remember
when
i
was
under
the
influence
of
a
mind
to
which
i
feel
the
greatest
obligations
the
mind
of
a
man
who
was
the
very
incarnation
of
sanity
and
clear
sense
a
man
the
most
considerable
it
seems
to
me
whom
america
has
yet
produced
benjamin
franklin
i
remember
the
relief
with
which
after
long
feeling
the
sway
of
franklin
imperturbable
i
came
upon
a
project
of
his
for
a
new
version
of
the
book
of
job
to
replace
the
old
version
the
style
of
which
says
franklin
has
become
obsolete
and
thence
less
agreeable
i
give
he
continues
a
few
verses
which
may
serve
as
a
sample
of
the
kind
of
version
i
would
recommend
we
all
recollect
the
famous
verse
in
our
translation
then
satan
answered
the
lord
and
said
job
fear
god
for
nought
franklin
makes
this
does
your
majesty
imagine
that
job
good
conduct
is
the
effect
of
mere
personal
attachment
and
affection
i
well
remember
how
when
first
i
read
that
i
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
and
said
to
myself
after
all
there
is
a
stretch
of
humanity
beyond
victorious
good
sense
so
after
hearing
bentham
cried
loudly
up
as
the
renovator
of
modern
society
and
bentham
mind
and
ideas
proposed
as
the
rulers
of
our
future
i
open
the
deontology
there
i
read
while
xenophon
was
writing
his
history
and
euclid
teaching
geometry
socrates
and
plato
were
talking
nonsense
under
pretence
of
talking
wisdom
and
morality
this
morality
of
theirs
consisted
in
words
this
wisdom
of
theirs
was
the
denial
of
matters
known
to
every
man
experience
from
the
moment
of
reading
that
i
am
delivered
from
the
bondage
of
bentham
the
fanaticism
of
his
adherents
can
touch
me
no
longer
i
feel
the
inadequacy
of
his
mind
and
ideas
for
being
the
rule
of
human
society
for
perfection
culture
tends
always
thus
to
deal
with
the
men
of
a
system
of
disciples
of
a
school
with
men
like
comte
or
the
late
buckle
or
mill
however
much
it
may
find
to
admire
in
these
personages
or
in
some
of
them
it
nevertheless
remembers
the
text
be
not
ye
called
rabbi
and
it
soon
passes
on
from
any
rabbi
but
jacobinism
loves
a
rabbi
it
does
not
want
to
pass
on
from
its
rabbi
in
pursuit
of
a
future
and
still
unreached
perfection
it
wants
its
rabbi
and
his
ideas
to
stand
for
perfection
that
they
may
with
the
more
authority
recast
the
world
and
for
jacobinism
therefore
culture
eternally
passing
onwards
and
seeking
is
an
impertinence
and
an
offence
but
culture
just
because
it
resists
this
tendency
of
jacobinism
to
impose
on
us
a
man
with
limitations
and
errors
of
his
own
along
with
the
true
ideas
of
which
he
is
the
organ
really
does
the
world
and
jacobinism
itself
a
service
so
too
jacobinism
in
its
fierce
hatred
of
the
past
and
of
those
whom
it
makes
liable
for
the
sins
of
the
past
can
not
away
with
culture
culture
with
its
inexhaustible
indulgence
its
consideration
of
circumstances
its
severe
judgment
of
actions
joined
to
its
merciful
judgment
of
persons
the
man
of
culture
is
in
politics
cries
frederic
harrison
one
of
the
poorest
mortals
alive
frederic
harrison
wants
to
be
doing
business
and
he
complains
that
the
man
of
culture
stops
him
with
a
turn
for
small
love
of
selfish
ease
and
indecision
in
action
of
what
use
is
culture
he
asks
except
for
a
critic
of
new
books
or
a
professor
of
belles
lettres
why
it
is
of
use
because
in
presence
of
the
fierce
exasperation
which
breathes
or
rather
i
may
say
hisses
through
the
whole
production
in
which
frederic
harrison
asks
that
question
it
reminds
us
that
the
perfection
of
human
nature
is
sweetness
and
light
it
is
of
use
because
like
religion
other
effort
after
perfection
it
testifies
that
where
bitter
envying
and
strife
are
there
is
confusion
and
every
evil
work
the
pursuit
of
perfection
then
is
the
pursuit
of
sweetness
and
light
he
who
works
for
sweetness
works
in
the
end
for
light
also
he
who
works
for
light
works
in
the
end
for
sweetness
also
but
he
who
works
for
sweetness
and
light
united
works
to
make
reason
and
the
will
of
god
prevail
he
who
works
for
machinery
he
who
works
for
hatred
works
only
for
confusion
culture
looks
beyond
machinery
culture
hates
hatred
culture
has
but
one
great
passion
the
passion
for
sweetness
and
light
yes
it
has
one
yet
greater
the
passion
for
making
them
prevail
it
is
not
satisfied
till
we
all
come
to
a
perfect
man
it
knows
that
the
sweetness
and
light
of
the
few
must
be
imperfect
until
the
raw
and
unkindled
masses
of
humanity
are
touched
with
sweetness
and
light
if
i
have
not
shrunk
from
saying
that
we
must
work
for
sweetness
and
light
so
neither
have
i
shrunk
from
saying
that
we
must
have
a
broad
basis
must
have
sweetness
and
light
for
as
many
as
possible
again
and
again
i
have
insisted
how
those
are
the
happy
moments
of
humanity
how
those
are
the
marking
epochs
of
a
people
life
how
those
are
the
flowering
times
for
literature
and
art
and
all
the
creative
power
of
genius
when
there
is
a
national
glow
of
life
and
thought
when
the
whole
of
society
is
in
the
fullest
measure
permeated
by
thought
sensible
to
beauty
intelligent
and
alive
only
it
must
be
real
thought
and
real
beauty
real
sweetness
and
real
light
plenty
of
people
will
try
to
give
the
masses
as
they
call
them
an
intellectual
food
prepared
and
adapted
in
the
way
they
think
proper
for
the
actual
condition
of
the
masses
the
ordinary
popular
literature
is
an
example
of
this
way
of
working
on
the
masses
plenty
of
people
will
try
to
indoctrinate
the
masses
with
the
set
of
ideas
and
judgments
constituting
the
creed
of
their
own
profession
or
party
our
religious
and
political
organisations
give
an
example
of
this
way
of
working
on
the
masses
i
condemn
neither
way
but
culture
works
differently
it
does
not
try
to
teach
down
to
the
level
of
inferior
classes
it
does
not
try
to
win
them
for
this
or
that
sect
of
its
own
with
judgments
and
watchwords
it
seeks
to
do
away
with
classes
to
make
all
live
in
an
atmosphere
of
sweetness
and
light
and
use
ideas
as
it
uses
them
itself
freely
to
be
nourished
and
not
bound
by
them
this
is
the
social
idea
and
the
men
of
culture
are
the
true
apostles
of
equality
the
great
men
of
culture
are
those
who
have
had
a
passion
for
diffusing
for
making
prevail
for
carrying
from
one
end
of
society
to
the
other
the
best
knowledge
the
best
ideas
of
their
time
who
have
laboured
to
divest
knowledge
of
all
that
was
harsh
uncouth
difficult
abstract
professional
exclusive
to
humanise
it
to
make
it
efficient
outside
the
clique
of
the
cultivated
and
learned
yet
still
remaining
the
best
knowledge
and
thought
of
the
time
and
a
true
source
therefore
of
sweetness
and
light
such
a
man
was
abelard
in
the
middle
ages
in
spite
of
all
his
imperfections
and
thence
the
boundless
emotion
and
enthusiasm
which
abelard
excited
such
were
lessing
and
herder
in
germany
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
and
their
services
to
germany
were
in
this
way
inestimably
precious
generations
will
pass
and
literary
monuments
will
accumulate
and
works
far
more
perfect
than
the
works
of
lessing
and
herder
will
be
produced
in
germany
and
yet
the
names
of
these
two
men
will
fill
a
german
with
a
reverence
and
enthusiasm
such
as
the
names
of
the
most
gifted
masters
will
hardly
awaken
because
they
humanised
knowledge
because
they
broadened
the
basis
of
life
and
intelligence
because
they
worked
powerfully
to
diffuse
sweetness
and
light
to
make
reason
and
the
will
of
god
prevail
with
saint
augustine
they
said
let
us
not
leave
thee
alone
to
make
in
the
secret
of
thy
knowledge
as
thou
didst
before
the
creation
of
the
firmament
the
division
of
light
from
darkness
let
the
children
of
thy
spirit
placed
in
their
firmament
make
their
light
shine
upon
the
earth
mark
the
division
of
night
and
day
and
announce
the
revolution
of
the
times
for
the
old
order
is
passed
and

the

the

i
have
been
trying
to
show
that
culture
is
or
ought
to
be
the
study
and
pursuit
of
perfection
and
that
of
perfection
as
pursued
by
culture
beauty
and
intelligence
or
in
other
words
sweetness
and
light
are
the
main
characters
but
hitherto
i
have
been
insisting
chiefly
on
beauty
or
sweetness
as
a
character
of
perfection
to
complete
rightly
my
design
it
evidently
remains
to
speak
also
of
intelligence
or
light
as
a
character
of
perfection
first
however
i
ought
perhaps
to
notice
that
both
here
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
all
sorts
of
objections
are
raised
against
the
religion
of
culture
as
the
objectors
mockingly
call
it
which
i
am
supposed
to
be
promulgating
it
is
said
to
be
a
religion
proposing
parmaceti
or
some
scented
salve
or
other
as
a
cure
for
human
miseries
a
religion
breathing
a
spirit
of
cultivated
inaction
making
its
believer
refuse
to
lend
a
hand
at
uprooting
the
definite
evils
on
all
sides
of
us
and
filling
him
with
antipathy
against
the
reforms
and
reformers
which
try
to
extirpate
them
in
general
it
is
summed
up
as
being
not
practical
or
as
some
critics
more
familiarly
put
it
all
moonshine
that
alcibiades
the
editor
of
the
morning
star
taunts
me
as
its
promulgator
with
living
out
of
the
world
and
knowing
nothing
of
life
and
men
that
great
austere
toiler
the
editor
of
the
daily
telegraph
upbraids
me
but
kindly
and
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
for
trifling
with
aesthetics
and
poetical
fancies
while
he
himself
in
that
arsenal
of
his
in
fleet
street
is
bearing
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
day
an
intelligent
american
newspaper
the
nation
says
that
it
is
very
easy
to
sit
in
one
study
and
find
fault
with
the
course
of
modern
society
but
the
thing
is
to
propose
practical
improvements
for
it
while
finally
frederic
harrison
in
a
very
and
witty
satire
which
makes
me
quite
understand
his
having
apparently
achieved
such
a
conquest
of
my
young
prussian
friend
arminius
at
last
gets
moved
to
an
almost
stern
moral
impatience
to
behold
as
he
says
death
sin
cruelty
stalk
among
us
filling
their
maws
with
innocence
and
youth
and
me
in
the
midst
of
the
general
tribulation
handing
out
my
it
is
impossible
that
all
these
remonstrances
and
reproofs
should
not
affect
me
and
i
shall
try
my
very
best
in
completing
my
design
and
in
speaking
of
light
as
one
of
the
characters
of
perfection
and
of
culture
as
giving
us
light
to
profit
by
the
objections
i
have
heard
and
read
and
to
drive
at
practice
as
much
as
i
can
by
showing
the
communications
and
passages
into
practical
life
from
the
doctrine
which
i
am
inculcating
it
is
said
that
a
man
with
my
theories
of
sweetness
and
light
is
full
of
antipathy
against
the
rougher
or
coarser
movements
going
on
around
him
that
he
will
not
lend
a
hand
to
the
humble
operation
of
uprooting
evil
by
their
means
and
that
therefore
the
believers
in
action
grow
impatient
with
them
but
what
if
rough
and
coarse
action
action
action
with
insufficient
light
is
and
has
for
a
long
time
been
our
bane
what
if
our
urgent
want
now
is
not
to
act
at
any
price
but
rather
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
light
for
our
difficulties
in
that
case
to
refuse
to
lend
a
hand
to
the
rougher
and
coarser
movements
going
on
round
us
to
make
the
primary
need
both
for
oneself
and
others
to
consist
in
enlightening
ourselves
and
qualifying
ourselves
to
act
less
at
random
is
surely
the
best
and
in
real
truth
the
most
practical
line
our
endeavours
can
take
so
that
if
i
can
show
what
my
opponents
call
rough
or
coarse
action
but
what
i
would
rather
call
random
and
regulated
action
action
with
insufficient
light
action
pursued
because
we
like
to
be
doing
something
and
doing
it
as
we
please
and
do
not
like
the
trouble
of
thinking
and
the
severe
constraint
of
any
kind
of
rule
if
i
can
show
this
to
be
at
the
present
moment
a
practical
mischief
and
danger
to
us
then
i
have
found
a
practical
use
for
light
in
correcting
this
state
of
things
and
have
only
to
exemplify
how
in
cases
which
fall
under
everybody
observation
it
may
deal
with
it
when
i
began
to
speak
of
culture
i
insisted
on
our
bondage
to
machinery
on
our
proneness
to
value
machinery
as
an
end
in
itself
without
looking
beyond
it
to
the
end
for
which
alone
in
truth
it
is
valuable
freedom
i
said
was
one
of
those
things
which
we
thus
worshipped
in
itself
without
enough
regarding
the
ends
for
which
freedom
is
to
be
desired
in
our
common
notions
and
talk
about
freedom
we
eminently
show
our
idolatry
of
machinery
our
prevalent
notion
is
and
i
quoted
a
number
of
instances
to
prove
it
that
it
is
a
most
happy
and
important
thing
for
a
man
merely
to
be
able
to
do
as
he
likes
on
what
he
is
to
do
when
he
is
thus
free
to
do
as
he
likes
we
do
not
lay
so
much
stress
our
familiar
praise
of
the
british
constitution
under
which
we
live
is
that
it
is
a
system
of
checks
a
system
which
stops
and
paralyses
any
power
in
interfering
with
the
free
action
of
individuals
to
this
effect
mr
bright
who
loves
to
walk
in
the
old
ways
of
the
constitution
said
forcibly
in
one
of
his
great
speeches
what
many
other
people
are
every
day
saying
less
forcibly
that
the
central
idea
of
english
life
and
politics
is
the
assertion
of
personal
liberty
evidently
this
is
so
but
evidently
also
as
feudalism
which
with
its
ideas
and
habits
of
subordination
was
for
many
centuries
silently
behind
the
british
constitution
dies
out
and
we
are
left
with
nothing
but
our
system
of
checks
and
our
notion
of
its
being
the
great
right
and
happiness
of
an
englishman
to
do
as
far
as
possible
what
he
likes
we
are
in
danger
of
drifting
towards
anarchy
we
have
not
the
notion
so
familiar
on
the
continent
and
to
antiquity
of
the
state
the
nation
in
its
collective
and
corporate
character
entrusted
with
stringent
powers
for
the
general
advantage
and
controlling
individual
wills
in
the
name
of
an
interest
wider
than
that
of
individuals
we
say
what
is
very
true
that
this
notion
is
often
made
instrumental
to
tyranny
we
say
that
a
state
is
in
reality
made
up
of
the
individuals
who
compose
it
and
that
every
individual
is
the
best
judge
of
his
own
interests
our
leading
class
is
an
aristocracy
and
no
aristocracy
likes
the
notion
of
a
greater
than
itself
with
a
stringent
administrative
machinery
superseding
the
decorative
inutilities
of
lieutenancy
and
the
posse
comitatûs
which
are
all
in
its
own
hands
our
the
great
representative
of
trade
and
dissent
with
its
maxims
of
every
man
for
himself
in
business
every
man
for
himself
in
religion
dreads
a
powerful
administration
which
might
somehow
interfere
with
it
and
besides
it
has
its
own
decorative
inutilities
of
vestrymanship
and
guardianship
which
are
to
this
class
what
and
the
county
magistracy
are
to
the
aristocratic
class
and
a
stringent
administration
might
either
take
these
functions
out
of
its
hands
or
prevent
its
exercising
them
in
its
own
comfortable
independent
manner
as
at
present
then
as
to
our
this
class
pressed
constantly
by
the
hard
daily
compulsion
of
material
wants
is
naturally
the
very
centre
and
stronghold
of
our
national
idea
that
it
is
man
ideal
right
and
felicity
to
do
as
he
likes
i
think
i
have
somewhere
related
how
monsieur
michelet
said
to
me
of
the
people
of
france
that
it
was
a
nation
of
barbarians
civilised
by
the
conscription
he
meant
that
through
their
military
service
the
idea
of
public
duty
and
of
discipline
was
brought
to
the
mind
of
these
masses
in
other
respects
so
raw
and
uncultivated
our
masses
are
quite
as
raw
and
uncultivated
as
the
french
and
so
far
from
their
having
the
idea
of
public
duty
and
of
discipline
superior
to
the
individual
will
brought
to
their
mind
by
a
universal
obligation
of
military
service
such
as
that
of
the
conscription
so
far
from
their
having
this
the
very
idea
of
a
conscription
is
so
at
variance
with
our
english
notion
of
the
prime
right
and
blessedness
of
doing
as
one
likes
that
i
remember
the
manager
of
the
clay
cross
works
in
derbyshire
told
me
during
the
crimean
war
when
our
want
of
soldiers
was
much
felt
and
some
people
were
talking
of
a
conscription
that
sooner
than
submit
to
a
conscription
the
population
of
that
district
would
flee
to
the
mines
and
lead
a
sort
of
robin
hood
life
under
ground
for
a
long
time
as
i
have
said
the
strong
feudal
habits
of
subordination
and
deference
continued
to
tell
upon
the
the
modern
spirit
has
now
almost
entirely
dissolved
those
habits
and
the
anarchical
tendency
of
our
worship
of
freedom
in
and
for
itself
of
our
superstitious
faith
as
i
say
in
machinery
is
becoming
very
manifest
more
and
more
because
of
this
our
blind
faith
in
machinery
because
of
our
want
of
light
to
enable
us
to
look
beyond
machinery
to
the
end
for
which
machinery
is
valuable
this
and
that
man
and
this
and
that
body
of
men
all
over
the
country
are
beginning
to
assert
and
put
in
practice
an
englishman
right
to
do
what
he
likes
his
right
to
march
where
he
likes
meet
where
he
likes
enter
where
he
likes
hoot
as
he
likes
threaten
as
he
likes
smash
as
he
likes
all
this
i
say
tends
to
anarchy
and
though
a
number
of
excellent
people
and
particularly
my
friends
of
the
liberal
or
progressive
party
as
they
call
themselves
are
kind
enough
to
reassure
us
by
saying
that
these
are
trifles
that
a
few
transient
outbreaks
of
rowdyism
signify
nothing
that
our
system
of
liberty
is
one
which
itself
cures
all
the
evils
which
it
works
that
the
educated
and
intelligent
classes
stand
in
overwhelming
strength
and
majestic
repose
ready
like
our
military
force
in
riots
to
act
at
a
moment
notice
yet
one
finds
that
one
liberal
friends
generally
say
this
because
they
have
such
faith
in
themselves
and
their
nostrums
when
they
shall
return
as
the
public
welfare
requires
to
place
and
power
but
this
faith
of
theirs
one
can
not
exactly
share
when
one
has
so
long
had
them
and
their
nostrums
at
work
and
sees
that
they
have
not
prevented
our
coming
to
our
present
embarrassed
condition
and
one
finds
also
that
the
outbreaks
of
rowdyism
tend
to
become
less
and
less
of
trifles
to
become
more
frequent
rather
than
less
frequent
and
that
meanwhile
our
educated
and
intelligent
classes
remain
in
their
majestic
repose
and
somehow
or
other
whatever
happens
their
overwhelming
strength
like
our
military
force
in
riots
never
does
act
how
indeed
should
their
overwhelming
strength
act
when
the
man
who
gives
an
inflammatory
lecture
or
breaks
down
the
park
railings
or
invades
a
secretary
of
state
office
is
only
following
an
englishman
impulse
to
do
as
he
likes
and
our
own
conscience
tells
us
that
we
ourselves
have
always
regarded
this
impulse
as
something
primary
and
sacred
murphy
lectures
at
birmingham
and
showers
on
the
catholic
population
of
that
town
words
says
hardy
only
fit
to
be
addressed
to
thieves
or
murderers
what
then
murphy
has
his
own
reasons
of
several
kinds
he
suspects
the
roman
catholic
church
of
designs
upon
murphy
and
he
says
if
mayors
and
magistrates
do
not
care
for
their
wives
and
daughters
he
does
but
above
all
he
is
doing
as
he
likes
or
in
worthier
language
asserting
his
personal
liberty
i
will
carry
out
my
lectures
if
they
walk
over
my
body
as
a
dead
corpse
and
i
say
to
the
mayor
of
birmingham
that
he
is
my
servant
while
i
am
in
birmingham
and
as
my
servant
he
must
do
his
duty
and
protect
me
touching
and
beautiful
words
which
find
a
sympathetic
chord
in
every
british
bosom
the
moment
it
is
plainly
put
before
us
that
a
man
is
asserting
his
personal
liberty
we
are
half
disarmed
because
we
are
believers
in
freedom
and
not
in
some
dream
of
a
right
reason
to
which
the
assertion
of
our
freedom
is
to
be
subordinated
accordingly
the
secretary
of
state
had
to
say
that
although
the
lecturer
language
was
only
fit
to
be
addressed
to
thieves
or
murderers
yet
i
do
not
think
he
is
to
be
deprived
i
do
not
think
that
anything
i
have
said
could
justify
the
inference
that
he
is
to
be
deprived
of
the
right
of
protection
in
a
place
built
by
him
for
the
purpose
of
these
lectures
because
the
language
was
not
language
which
afforded
grounds
for
a
criminal
prosecution
no
nor
to
be
silenced
by
mayor
or
home
secretary
or
any
administrative
authority
on
earth
simply
on
their
notion
of
what
is
discreet
and
reasonable
this
is
in
perfect
consonance
with
our
public
opinion
and
with
our
national
love
for
the
assertion
of
personal
liberty
in
quite
another
department
of
affairs
an
experienced
and
distinguished
chancery
judge
relates
an
incident
which
is
just
to
the
same
effect
as
this
of
murphy
a
testator
bequeathed
a
year
to
be
for
ever
applied
as
a
pension
to
some
person
who
had
been
unsuccessful
in
literature
and
whose
duty
should
be
to
support
and
diffuse
by
his
writings
the
testator
own
views
as
enforced
in
the
testator
publications
this
bequest
was
appealed
against
in
the
court
of
chancery
on
the
ground
of
its
absurdity
but
being
only
absurd
it
was
upheld
and
the
charity
was
established
having
i
say
at
the
bottom
of
our
english
hearts
a
very
strong
belief
in
freedom
and
a
very
weak
belief
in
right
reason
we
are
soon
silenced
when
a
man
pleads
the
prime
right
to
do
as
he
likes
because
this
is
the
prime
right
for
ourselves
too
and
even
if
we
attempt
now
and
then
to
mumble
something
about
reason
yet
we
have
ourselves
thought
so
little
about
this
and
so
much
about
liberty
that
we
are
in
conscience
forced
when
our
brother
philistine
with
whom
we
are
meddling
turns
boldly
round
upon
us
and
asks
have
you
any
light
to
shake
our
heads
ruefully
and
to
let
him
go
his
own
way
after
all
there
are
many
things
to
be
said
on
behalf
of
this
exclusive
attention
of
ours
to
liberty
and
of
the
relaxed
habits
of
government
which
it
has
engendered
it
is
very
easy
to
mistake
or
to
exaggerate
the
sort
of
anarchy
from
which
we
are
in
danger
through
them
we
are
not
in
danger
from
fenianism
fierce
and
turbulent
as
it
may
show
itself
for
against
this
our
conscience
is
free
enough
to
let
us
act
resolutely
and
put
forth
our
overwhelming
strength
the
moment
there
is
any
real
need
for
it
in
the
first
place
it
never
was
any
part
of
our
creed
that
the
great
right
and
blessedness
of
an
irishman
or
indeed
of
anybody
on
earth
except
an
englishman
is
to
do
as
he
likes
and
we
can
have
no
scruple
at
all
about
abridging
if
necessary
a
assertion
of
personal
liberty
the
british
constitution
its
checks
and
its
prime
virtues
are
for
englishmen
we
may
extend
them
to
others
out
of
love
and
kindness
but
we
find
no
real
divine
law
written
on
our
hearts
constraining
us
so
to
extend
them
and
then
the
difference
between
an
irish
fenian
and
an
english
rough
is
so
immense
and
the
case
in
dealing
with
the
fenian
so
much
more
clear
he
is
so
evidently
desperate
and
dangerous
a
man
of
a
conquered
race
a
papist
with
centuries
of
to
inflame
him
against
us
with
an
alien
religion
established
in
his
country
by
us
at
his
expense
with
no
admiration
of
our
institutions
no
love
of
our
virtues
no
talents
for
our
business
no
turn
for
our
comfort
show
him
our
symbolical
truss
manufactory
on
the
finest
site
in
europe
and
tell
him
that
british
industrialism
and
individualism
can
bring
a
man
to
that
and
he
remains
cold
evidently
if
we
deal
tenderly
with
a
sentimentalist
like
this
it
is
out
of
pure
philanthropy
but
with
the
hyde
park
rioter
how
different
he
is
our
own
flesh
and
blood
he
is
a
protestant
he
is
framed
by
nature
to
do
as
we
do
hate
what
we
hate
love
what
we
love
he
is
capable
of
feeling
the
symbolical
force
of
the
truss
manufactory
the
question
of
questions
for
him
is
a
wages
question
that
beautiful
sentence
sir
daniel
gooch
quoted
to
the
swindon
workmen
and
which
i
treasure
as
golden
rule
or
the
divine
injunction
be
ye
perfect
done
into
british
the
sentence
sir
daniel
gooch
mother
repeated
to
him
every
morning
when
he
was
a
boy
going
to
work
ever
remember
my
dear
dan
that
you
should
look
forward
to
being
some
day
manager
of
that
concern
this
fruitful
maxim
is
perfectly
fitted
to
shine
forth
in
the
heart
of
the
hyde
park
rough
also
and
to
be
his
through
life
he
has
no
visionary
schemes
of
revolution
and
transformation
though
of
course
he
would
like
his
class
to
rule
as
the
aristocratic
class
like
their
class
to
rule
and
the
theirs
meanwhile
our
social
machine
is
a
little
out
of
order
there
are
a
good
many
people
in
our
paradisiacal
centres
of
industrialism
and
individualism
taking
the
bread
out
of
one
mouths
the
rioter
has
not
yet
quite
found
his
groove
and
settled
down
to
his
work
and
so
he
is
just
asserting
his
personal
liberty
a
little
going
where
he
likes
assembling
where
he
likes
bawling
as
he
likes
hustling
as
he
likes
just
as
the
rest
of
us
as
the
country
squires
in
the
aristocratic
class
as
the
political
dissenters
in
the
he
has
no
idea
of
a
state
of
the
nation
in
its
collective
and
corporate
character
controlling
as
government
the
free
swing
of
this
or
that
one
of
its
members
in
the
name
of
the
higher
reason
of
all
of
them
his
own
as
well
as
that
of
others
he
sees
the
rich
the
aristocratic
class
in
occupation
of
the
executive
government
and
so
if
he
is
stopped
from
making
hyde
park
a
or
the
streets
impassable
he
says
he
is
being
butchered
by
the
aristocracy
his
apparition
is
somewhat
embarrassing
because
too
many
cooks
spoil
the
broth
because
while
the
aristocratic
and
middle
classes
have
long
been
doing
as
they
like
with
great
vigour
he
has
been
too
undeveloped
and
submissive
hitherto
to
join
in
the
game
and
now
when
he
does
come
he
comes
in
immense
numbers
and
is
rather
raw
and
rough
but
he
does
not
break
many
laws
or
not
many
at
one
time
and
as
our
laws
were
made
for
very
different
circumstances
from
our
present
but
always
with
an
eye
to
englishmen
doing
as
they
like
and
as
the
clear
letter
of
the
law
must
be
against
our
englishman
who
does
as
he
likes
and
not
only
the
spirit
of
the
law
and
public
policy
and
as
government
must
neither
have
any
discretionary
power
nor
act
resolutely
on
its
own
interpretation
of
the
law
if
any
one
disputes
it
it
is
evident
our
laws
give
our
playful
giant
in
doing
as
he
likes
considerable
advantage
besides
even
if
he
can
be
clearly
proved
to
commit
an
illegality
in
doing
as
he
likes
there
is
always
the
resource
of
not
putting
the
law
in
force
or
of
abolishing
it
so
he
has
his
way
and
if
he
has
his
way
he
is
soon
satisfied
for
the
time
however
he
falls
into
the
habit
of
taking
it
oftener
and
oftener
and
at
last
begins
to
create
by
his
operations
a
confusion
of
which
mischievous
people
can
take
advantage
and
which
at
any
rate
by
troubling
the
common
course
of
business
throughout
the
country
tends
to
cause
distress
and
so
to
increase
the
sort
of
anarchy
and
social
disintegration
which
had
previously
commenced
and
thus
that
profound
sense
of
settled
order
and
security
without
which
a
society
like
ours
can
not
live
and
grow
at
all
is
beginning
to
threaten
us
with
taking
its
departure
now
if
culture
which
simply
means
trying
to
perfect
oneself
and
one
mind
as
part
of
oneself
brings
us
light
and
if
light
shows
us
that
there
is
nothing
so
very
blessed
in
merely
doing
as
one
likes
that
the
worship
of
the
mere
freedom
to
do
as
one
likes
is
worship
of
machinery
that
the
really
blessed
thing
is
to
like
what
right
reason
ordains
and
to
follow
her
authority
then
we
have
got
a
practical
benefit
out
of
culture
we
have
got
a
much
wanted
principle
a
principle
of
authority
to
counteract
the
tendency
to
anarchy
which
seems
to
be
threatening
us
but
how
to
organise
this
authority
or
to
what
hands
to
entrust
the
wielding
of
it
how
to
get
your
state
summing
up
the
right
reason
of
the
community
and
giving
effect
to
it
as
circumstances
may
require
with
vigour
and
here
i
think
i
see
my
enemies
waiting
for
me
with
a
hungry
joy
in
their
eyes
but
i
shall
elude
them
the
state
the
power
most
representing
the
right
reason
of
the
nation
and
most
worthy
therefore
of
ruling
of
exercising
when
circumstances
require
it
authority
over
us
all
is
for
carlyle
the
aristocracy
for
lowe
it
is
the
with
its
incomparable
parliament
for
the
reform
league
it
is
the
class
with
its
brightest
powers
of
sympathy
and
readiest
powers
of
action
now
culture
with
its
disinterested
pursuit
of
perfection
culture
simply
trying
to
see
things
as
they
are
in
order
to
seize
on
the
best
and
to
make
it
prevail
is
surely
well
fitted
to
help
us
to
judge
rightly
by
all
the
aids
of
observing
reading
and
thinking
the
qualifications
and
titles
to
our
confidence
of
these
three
candidates
for
authority
and
can
thus
render
us
a
practical
service
of
no
mean
value
so
when
carlyle
a
man
of
genius
to
whom
we
have
all
at
one
time
or
other
been
indebted
for
refreshment
and
stimulus
says
we
should
give
rule
to
the
aristocracy
mainly
because
of
its
dignity
and
politeness
surely
culture
is
useful
in
reminding
us
that
in
our
idea
of
perfection
the
characters
of
beauty
and
intelligence
are
both
of
them
present
and
sweetness
and
light
the
two
noblest
of
things
are
united
allowing
therefore
with
carlyle
the
aristocratic
class
to
possess
sweetness
culture
insists
on
the
necessity
of
light
also
and
shows
us
that
aristocracies
being
by
the
very
nature
of
things
inaccessible
to
ideas
unapt
to
see
how
the
world
is
going
must
be
somewhat
wanting
in
light
and
must
therefore
be
at
a
moment
when
light
is
our
great
requisite
inadequate
to
our
needs
aristocracies
those
children
of
the
established
fact
are
for
epochs
of
concentration
in
epochs
of
expansion
epochs
such
as
that
in
which
we
now
live
epochs
when
always
the
warning
voice
is
again
heard
now
is
the
judgment
of
this
world
in
such
epochs
aristocracies
with
their
natural
clinging
to
the
established
fact
their
want
of
sense
for
the
flux
of
things
for
the
inevitable
transitoriness
of
all
human
institutions
are
bewildered
and
helpless
their
serenity
their
high
spirit
their
power
of
haughty
resistance
the
great
qualities
of
an
aristocracy
and
the
secret
of
its
distinguished
manners
and
dignity
these
very
qualities
in
an
epoch
of
expansion
turn
against
their
possessors
again
and
again
i
have
said
how
the
refinement
of
an
aristocracy
may
be
precious
and
educative
to
a
raw
nation
as
a
kind
of
shadow
of
true
refinement
how
its
serenity
and
dignified
freedom
from
petty
cares
may
serve
as
a
useful
foil
to
set
off
the
vulgarity
and
hideousness
of
that
type
of
life
which
a
hard
tends
to
establish
and
to
help
people
to
see
this
vulgarity
and
hideousness
in
their
true
colours
from
such
an
ignoble
spectacle
as
that
of
poor
lincoln
a
spectacle
to
vulgarise
a
whole
nation
aristocracies
undoubtedly
preserve
us
but
the
true
grace
and
serenity
is
that
of
which
greece
and
greek
art
suggest
the
admirable
ideals
of
perfection
a
serenity
which
comes
from
having
made
order
among
ideas
and
harmonised
them
whereas
the
serenity
of
aristocracies
at
least
the
peculiar
serenity
of
aristocracies
of
teutonic
origin
appears
to
come
from
their
never
having
had
any
ideas
to
trouble
them
and
so
in
a
time
of
expansion
like
the
present
a
time
for
ideas
one
gets
perhaps
in
regarding
an
aristocracy
even
more
than
the
idea
of
serenity
the
idea
of
futility
and
sterility
one
has
often
wondered
whether
upon
the
whole
earth
there
is
anything
so
unintelligent
so
unapt
to
perceive
how
the
world
is
really
going
as
an
ordinary
young
englishman
of
our
upper
class
ideas
he
has
not
and
neither
has
he
that
seriousness
of
our
which
is
as
i
have
often
said
the
great
strength
of
this
class
and
may
become
its
salvation
why
a
man
may
hear
a
young
dives
of
the
aristocratic
class
when
the
whim
takes
him
to
sing
the
praises
of
wealth
and
material
comfort
sing
them
with
a
cynicism
from
which
the
conscience
of
the
veriest
philistine
of
our
industrial
would
recoil
in
affright
and
when
with
the
natural
sympathy
of
aristocracies
for
firm
dealing
with
the
multitude
and
his
uneasiness
at
our
feeble
dealing
with
it
at
home
an
unvarnished
young
englishman
of
our
aristocratic
class
applauds
the
absolute
rulers
on
the
continent
he
in
general
manages
completely
to
miss
the
grounds
of
reason
and
intelligence
which
alone
can
give
any
colour
of
justification
any
possibility
of
existence
to
those
rulers
and
applauds
them
on
grounds
which
it
would
make
their
own
hair
stand
on
end
to
listen
to
and
all
this
time
we
are
in
an
epoch
of
expansion
and
the
essence
of
an
epoch
of
expansion
is
a
movement
of
ideas
and
the
one
salvation
of
an
epoch
of
expansion
is
a
harmony
of
ideas
the
very
principle
of
the
authority
which
we
are
seeking
as
a
defence
against
anarchy
is
right
reason
ideas
light
the
more
therefore
an
aristocracy
calls
to
its
aid
its
innate
forces
its
impenetrability
its
high
spirit
its
power
of
haughty
resistance
to
deal
with
an
epoch
of
expansion
the
graver
is
the
danger
the
greater
the
certainty
of
explosion
the
surer
the
aristocracy
defeat
for
it
is
trying
to
do
violence
to
nature
instead
of
working
along
with
it
the
best
powers
shown
by
the
best
men
of
an
aristocracy
at
such
an
epoch
are
it
will
be
observed
powers
powers
of
industry
powers
of
intelligence
and
these
powers
thus
exhibited
tend
really
not
to
strengthen
the
aristocracy
but
to
take
their
owners
out
of
it
to
expose
them
to
the
dissolving
agencies
of
thought
and
change
to
make
them
men
of
the
modern
spirit
and
of
the
future
if
as
sometimes
happens
they
add
to
their
aristocratical
qualities
of
labour
and
thought
a
strong
dose
of
aristocratical
qualities
also
of
pride
defiance
turn
for
resistance
this
truly
aristocratical
side
of
them
so
far
from
adding
any
strength
to
them
really
neutralises
their
force
and
makes
them
impracticable
and
ineffective
knowing
myself
to
be
indeed
sadly
to
seek
as
one
of
my
many
critics
says
in
a
philosophy
with
coherent
interdependent
subordinate
and
derivative
principles
i
continually
have
recourse
to
a
plain
expedient
of
trying
to
make
what
few
simple
notions
i
have
clearer
and
more
intelligible
to
myself
by
means
of
example
and
illustration
and
having
been
brought
up
at
oxford
in
the
bad
old
times
when
we
were
stuffed
with
greek
and
aristotle
and
thought
nothing
of
preparing
ourselves
as
after
lowe
great
speech
at
edinburgh
we
shall
do
to
fight
the
battle
of
life
with
the
german
waiters
my
head
is
still
full
of
a
lumber
of
phrases
we
learnt
at
oxford
from
aristotle
about
virtue
being
in
a
mean
and
about
excess
and
defect
and
so
on
once
when
i
had
had
the
advantage
of
listening
to
the
reform
debates
in
the
house
of
commons
having
heard
a
number
of
interesting
speakers
and
among
them
lord
elcho
and
sir
thomas
bateson
i
remember
it
struck
me
applying
machinery
of
the
mean
to
my
ideas
about
our
aristocracy
that
lord
elcho
was
exactly
the
perfection
or
happy
mean
or
virtue
of
aristocracy
and
sir
thomas
bateson
the
excess
and
i
fancied
that
by
observing
these
two
we
might
see
both
the
inadequacy
of
aristocracy
to
supply
the
principle
of
authority
needful
for
our
present
wants
and
the
danger
of
its
trying
to
supply
it
when
it
was
not
really
competent
for
the
business
on
the
one
hand
in
lord
elcho
showing
plenty
of
high
spirit
but
remarkable
far
above
and
beyond
his
gift
of
high
spirit
for
the
fine
tempering
of
his
high
spirit
for
ease
serenity
politeness
the
great
virtues
as
carlyle
says
of
aristocracy
in
this
beautiful
and
virtuous
mean
there
seemed
evidently
some
insufficiency
of
light
while
on
the
other
hand
sir
thomas
bateson
in
whom
the
high
spirit
of
aristocracy
its
impenetrability
defiant
courage
and
pride
of
resistance
were
developed
even
in
excess
was
manifestly
capable
if
he
had
his
way
given
him
of
causing
us
great
danger
and
indeed
of
throwing
the
whole
commonwealth
into
confusion
then
i
reverted
to
that
old
fundamental
notion
of
mine
about
the
grand
merit
of
our
race
being
really
our
honesty
and
the
very
helplessness
of
our
aristocratic
or
governing
class
in
dealing
with
our
perturbed
social
state
gave
me
a
sort
of
pride
and
satisfaction
because
i
saw
they
were
as
a
whole
too
honest
to
try
and
manage
a
business
for
which
they
did
not
feel
themselves
capable
surely
now
it
is
no
inconsiderable
boon
culture
confers
upon
us
if
in
embarrassed
times
like
the
present
it
enables
us
to
look
at
the
ins
and
the
outs
of
things
in
this
way
without
hatred
and
without
partiality
and
with
a
disposition
to
see
the
good
in
everybody
all
round
and
i
try
to
follow
just
the
same
course
with
our
class
as
with
our
aristocracy
lowe
talks
to
us
of
this
strong
middle
part
of
the
nation
of
the
unrivalled
deeds
of
our
liberal
parliament
of
the
noble
the
heroic
work
it
has
performed
in
the
last
thirty
years
and
i
begin
to
ask
myself
if
we
shall
not
then
find
in
our
the
principle
of
authority
we
want
and
if
we
had
not
better
take
administration
as
well
as
legislation
away
from
the
weak
extreme
which
now
administers
for
us
and
commit
both
to
the
strong
middle
part
i
observe
too
that
the
heroes
of
liberalism
such
as
we
have
hitherto
known
it
speak
with
a
kind
of
prophetic
anticipation
of
the
great
destiny
which
awaits
them
and
as
if
the
future
was
clearly
theirs
the
advanced
party
the
progressive
party
the
party
in
alliance
with
the
future
are
the
names
they
like
to
give
themselves
the
principles
which
will
obtain
recognition
in
the
future
says
miall
a
personage
of
deserved
eminence
among
the
political
dissenters
as
they
are
called
who
have
been
the
backbone
of
class
liberalism
the
principles
which
will
obtain
recognition
in
the
future
are
the
principles
for
which
i
have
long
and
zealously
laboured
i
qualified
myself
for
joining
in
the
work
of
harvest
by
doing
to
the
best
of
my
ability
the
duties
of
these
duties
if
one
is
to
gather
them
from
the
works
of
the
great
liberal
party
in
the
last
thirty
years
are
as
i
have
elsewhere
summed
them
up
the
advocacy
of
of
parliamentary
reform
of
abolition
of
of
voluntaryism
in
religion
and
education
of
interference
of
the
state
between
employers
and
employed
and
of
marriage
with
one
deceased
wife
sister
now
i
know
when
i
object
that
all
this
is
machinery
the
great
liberal
has
by
this
time
grown
cunning
enough
to
answer
that
it
always
meant
more
by
these
things
than
meets
the
eye
that
it
has
had
that
within
which
passes
show
and
that
we
are
soon
going
to
see
in
a
free
church
and
all
manner
of
good
things
what
it
was
but
i
have
learned
from
bishop
wilson
if
frederic
harrison
will
forgive
my
again
quoting
that
poor
old
hierophant
of
a
decayed
superstition
if
we
would
really
know
our
heart
let
us
impartially
view
our
actions
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
if
our
liberals
had
had
so
much
sweetness
and
light
in
their
inner
minds
as
they
allege
more
of
it
must
have
come
out
in
their
sayings
and
doings
an
american
friend
of
the
english
liberals
says
indeed
that
their
dissidence
of
dissent
has
been
a
mere
instrument
of
the
political
dissenters
for
making
reason
and
the
will
of
god
prevail
and
no
doubt
he
would
say
the
same
of
marriage
with
one
deceased
sister
and
that
the
abolition
of
a
state
church
is
merely
the
dissenter
means
to
this
end
just
as
culture
is
mine
another
american
defender
of
theirs
says
just
the
same
of
their
industrialism
and
indeed
this
gentleman
taking
the
bull
by
the
horns
proposes
that
we
should
for
the
future
call
industrialism
culture
and
the
industrialists
the
men
of
culture
and
then
of
course
there
can
be
no
longer
any
misapprehension
about
their
true
character
and
besides
the
pleasure
of
being
wealthy
and
comfortable
they
will
have
authentic
recognition
as
vessels
of
sweetness
and
light
all
this
is
undoubtedly
specious
but
i
must
remark
that
the
culture
of
which
i
talked
was
an
endeavour
to
come
at
reason
and
the
will
of
god
by
means
of
reading
observing
and
thinking
and
that
whoever
calls
anything
else
culture
may
indeed
call
it
so
if
he
likes
but
then
he
talks
of
something
quite
different
from
what
i
talked
of
and
again
as
culture
way
of
working
for
reason
and
the
will
of
god
is
by
directly
trying
to
know
more
about
them
while
the
dissidence
of
dissent
is
evidently
in
itself
no
effort
of
this
kind
nor
is
its
free
church
in
fact
a
church
with
worthier
conceptions
of
god
and
the
ordering
of
the
world
than
the
state
church
professes
but
with
mainly
the
same
conceptions
of
these
as
the
state
church
has
only
that
every
man
is
to
comport
himself
as
he
likes
in
professing
them
this
being
so
i
can
not
at
once
accept
the
nonconformity
any
more
than
the
industrialism
and
the
other
great
works
of
our
liberal
as
proof
positive
that
this
class
is
in
possession
of
light
and
that
here
is
the
true
seat
of
authority
for
which
we
are
in
search
but
i
must
try
a
little
further
and
seek
for
other
indications
which
may
enable
me
to
make
up
my
mind
why
should
we
not
do
with
the
as
we
have
done
with
the
aristocratic
class
find
in
it
some
representative
men
who
may
stand
for
the
virtuous
mean
of
this
class
for
the
perfection
of
its
present
qualities
and
mode
of
being
and
also
for
the
excess
of
them
such
men
must
clearly
not
be
men
of
genius
like
mr
bright
for
as
i
have
formerly
said
so
far
as
a
man
has
genius
he
tends
to
take
himself
out
of
the
category
of
class
altogether
and
to
become
simply
a
man
mr
bright
brother
jacob
bright
would
perhaps
be
more
to
the
purpose
he
seems
to
sum
up
very
well
in
himself
without
disturbing
influences
the
general
liberal
force
of
the
the
force
by
which
it
has
done
its
great
works
of
parliamentary
reform
voluntaryism
and
so
on
and
the
spirit
in
which
it
has
done
them
now
it
is
clear
from
what
has
been
already
said
that
there
has
been
at
least
an
apparent
want
of
light
in
the
force
and
spirit
through
which
these
great
works
have
been
done
and
that
the
works
have
worn
in
consequence
too
much
a
look
of
machinery
but
this
will
be
clearer
still
if
we
take
as
the
happy
mean
of
the
not
jacob
bright
but
his
colleague
in
the
representation
of
manchester
bazley
bazley
sums
up
for
us
in
general
the
its
spirit
and
its
works
at
least
as
well
as
jacob
bright
and
he
has
given
us
moreover
a
famous
sentence
which
bears
directly
on
the
resolution
of
our
present
question
whether
there
is
light
enough
in
our
to
make
it
the
proper
seat
of
the
authority
we
wish
to
establish
when
there
was
a
talk
some
little
while
ago
about
the
state
of
education
bazley
as
the
representative
of
that
class
spoke
some
memorable
words
there
had
been
a
cry
that
education
ought
to
receive
more
attention
he
confessed
himself
very
much
surprised
by
the
clamour
that
was
raised
he
did
not
think
that
class
need
excite
the
sympathy
either
of
the
legislature
or
the
public
now
this
satisfaction
of
bazley
with
the
mental
state
of
the
was
truly
representative
and
enhances
his
claim
if
that
were
necessary
to
stand
as
the
beautiful
and
virtuous
mean
of
that
class
but
it
is
obviously
at
variance
with
our
definition
of
culture
or
the
pursuit
of
light
and
perfection
which
made
light
and
perfection
consist
not
in
resting
and
being
but
in
growing
and
becoming
in
a
perpetual
advance
in
beauty
and
wisdom
so
the
is
by
its
essence
as
one
may
say
by
its
incomparable
decisively
expressed
through
its
beautiful
and
virtuous
mean
from
wielding
an
authority
of
which
light
is
to
be
the
very
soul
clear
as
this
is
it
will
be
made
clearer
still
if
we
take
some
representative
man
as
the
excess
of
the
and
remember
that
the
in
general
is
to
be
conceived
as
a
body
swaying
between
the
qualities
of
its
mean
and
of
its
excess
and
on
the
whole
of
course
as
human
nature
is
constituted
inclining
rather
towards
the
excess
than
the
mean
of
its
excess
no
better
representative
can
possibly
be
imagined
than
the
rev
cattle
a
dissenting
minister
from
walsall
who
came
before
the
public
in
connection
with
the
proceedings
at
birmingham
of
murphy
already
mentioned
speaking
in
the
midst
of
an
irritated
population
of
catholics
the
rev
cattle
exclaimed
i
say
then
away
with
the
mass
it
is
from
the
bottomless
pit
and
in
the
bottomless
pit
shall
all
liars
have
their
part
in
the
lake
that
burneth
with
fire
and
brimstone
and
again
when
all
the
praties
were
black
in
ireland
why
did
the
priests
say
the
over
them
and
make
them
all
good
again
he
shared
too
murphy
fears
of
some
invasion
of
his
domestic
happiness
what
i
wish
to
say
to
you
as
protestant
husbands
is
take
care
of
your
wives
and
finally
in
the
true
vein
of
an
englishman
doing
as
he
likes
a
vein
of
which
i
have
at
some
length
pointed
out
the
present
dangers
he
recommended
for
imitation
the
example
of
some
churchwardens
at
dublin
among
whom
said
he
there
was
a
luther
and
also
a
melancthon
who
had
made
very
short
work
with
some
ritualist
or
other
handed
him
down
from
his
pulpit
and
kicked
him
out
of
church
now
it
is
manifest
as
i
said
in
the
case
of
sir
thomas
bateson
that
if
we
let
this
excess
of
the
sturdy
english
this
conscientious
protestant
dissenter
so
strong
so
reliant
so
fully
persuaded
in
his
own
mind
have
his
way
he
would
be
capable
with
his
want
of
light
or
to
use
the
language
of
the
religious
world
with
his
zeal
without
knowledge
of
stirring
up
strife
which
neither
he
nor
any
one
else
could
easily
compose
and
then
comes
in
as
it
did
also
with
the
aristocracy
the
honesty
of
our
race
and
by
the
voice
of
another
man
alderman
wilson
alderman
of
the
city
of
london
and
colonel
of
the
city
of
london
militia
proclaims
that
it
has
twinges
of
conscience
and
that
it
will
not
attempt
to
cope
with
our
social
disorders
and
to
deal
with
a
business
which
it
feels
to
be
too
high
for
it
every
one
remembers
how
this
virtuous
or
led
his
militia
through
the
london
streets
how
the
bystanders
gathered
to
see
him
pass
how
the
london
roughs
asserting
an
englishman
best
and
most
blissful
right
of
doing
what
he
likes
robbed
and
beat
the
bystanders
and
how
the
blameless
magistrate
refused
to
let
his
troops
interfere
the
crowd
he
touchingly
said
afterwards
was
mostly
composed
of
fine
healthy
strong
men
bent
on
mischief
if
he
had
allowed
his
soldiers
to
interfere
they
might
have
been
overpowered
their
rifles
taken
from
them
and
used
against
them
by
the
mob
a
riot
in
fact
might
have
ensued
and
been
attended
with
bloodshed
compared
with
which
the
assaults
and
loss
of
property
that
actually
occurred
would
have
been
as
nothing
honest
and
affecting
testimony
of
the
english
class
to
its
own
inadequacy
for
the
authoritative
part
admiration
would
sometimes
incline
one
to
assign
to
it
who
are
we
they
say
by
the
voice
of
their
that
we
should
not
be
overpowered
if
we
attempt
to
cope
with
social
anarchy
our
rifles
taken
from
us
and
used
against
us
by
the
mob
and
we
perhaps
robbed
and
beaten
ourselves
or
what
light
have
we
beyond
a
born
englishman
impulse
to
do
as
he
likes
which
could
justify
us
in
preventing
at
the
cost
of
bloodshed
other
englishmen
from
doing
as
they
like
and
robbing
and
beating
us
as
much
as
they
please
this
distrust
of
themselves
as
an
adequate
centre
of
authority
does
not
mark
the
as
was
shown
by
their
readiness
the
other
day
in
hyde
park
to
take
upon
themselves
all
the
functions
of
government
but
this
comes
from
the
being
as
i
have
often
said
still
an
embryo
of
which
no
one
can
yet
quite
foresee
the
final
development
and
from
its
not
having
the
same
experience
and
as
the
aristocratic
and
middle
classes
honesty
it
no
doubt
has
just
like
the
other
classes
of
englishmen
but
honesty
in
an
inchoate
and
untrained
state
and
meanwhile
its
powers
of
action
which
are
as
frederic
harrison
says
exceedingly
ready
easily
run
away
with
it
that
it
can
not
at
present
have
a
sufficiency
of
light
which
comes
by
culture
that
is
by
reading
observing
and
thinking
is
clear
from
the
very
nature
of
its
condition
and
indeed
we
saw
that
frederic
harrison
in
seeking
to
make
a
free
stage
for
its
bright
powers
of
sympathy
and
ready
powers
of
action
had
to
begin
by
throwing
overboard
culture
and
flouting
it
as
only
fit
for
a
professor
of
belles
lettres
still
to
make
it
perfectly
manifest
that
no
more
in
the
than
in
the
aristocratic
and
middle
classes
can
one
find
an
adequate
centre
of
authority
that
is
as
culture
teaches
us
to
conceive
our
required
authority
of
light
let
us
again
follow
with
this
class
the
method
we
have
followed
with
the
aristocratic
and
middle
classes
and
try
to
bring
before
our
minds
representative
men
who
may
figure
to
us
its
virtue
and
its
excess
we
must
not
take
of
course
colonel
dickson
or
beales
because
colonel
dickson
by
his
martial
profession
and
dashing
exterior
seems
to
belong
properly
like
julius
caesar
and
mirabeau
and
other
great
popular
leaders
to
the
aristocratic
class
and
to
be
carried
into
the
popular
ranks
only
by
his
ambition
or
his
genius
while
beales
belongs
to
our
solid
and
perhaps
if
he
had
not
been
a
great
popular
leader
would
have
been
a
philistine
but
odger
whose
speeches
we
have
all
read
and
of
whom
his
friends
relate
besides
much
that
is
favourable
may
very
well
stand
for
the
beautiful
and
virtuous
mean
of
our
present
and
i
think
everybody
will
admit
that
in
odger
as
in
lord
elcho
there
is
manifestly
with
all
his
good
points
some
insufficiency
of
light
the
excess
of
the
in
its
present
state
of
development
is
perhaps
best
shown
in
bradlaugh
the
iconoclast
who
seems
to
be
almost
for
baptizing
us
all
in
blood
and
fire
into
his
new
social
dispensation
and
to
whose
reflections
now
that
i
have
once
been
set
going
on
bishop
wilson
track
i
can
not
forbear
commending
this
maxim
of
the
good
old
man
intemperance
in
talk
makes
a
dreadful
havoc
in
the
heart
bradlaugh
like
sir
thomas
bateson
and
the
rev
cattle
is
evidently
capable
if
he
had
his
head
given
him
of
running
us
all
into
great
dangers
and
confusion
i
conclude
therefore
what
indeed
few
of
those
who
do
me
the
honour
to
read
this
disquisition
are
likely
to
dispute
that
we
can
as
little
find
in
the
as
in
the
aristocratic
or
in
the
middle
class
our
source
of
authority
as
culture
suggests
it
to
us
well
then
what
if
we
tried
to
rise
above
the
idea
of
class
to
the
idea
of
the
whole
community
the
state
and
to
find
our
centre
of
light
and
authority
there
every
one
of
us
has
the
idea
of
country
as
a
sentiment
hardly
any
one
of
us
has
the
idea
of
the
state
as
a
working
power
and
why
because
we
habitually
live
in
our
ordinary
selves
which
do
not
carry
us
beyond
the
ideas
and
wishes
of
the
class
to
which
we
happen
to
belong
and
we
are
all
afraid
of
giving
to
the
state
too
much
power
because
we
only
conceive
of
the
state
as
something
equivalent
to
the
class
in
occupation
of
the
executive
government
and
are
afraid
of
that
class
abusing
power
to
its
own
purposes
if
we
strengthen
the
state
with
the
aristocratic
class
in
occupation
of
the
executive
government
we
imagine
we
are
delivering
ourselves
up
captive
to
the
ideas
and
wishes
of
sir
thomas
bateson
if
with
the
in
occupation
of
the
executive
government
to
those
of
the
rev
cattle
if
with
the
class
to
those
of
bradlaugh
and
with
much
justice
owing
to
the
exaggerated
notion
which
we
english
as
i
have
said
entertain
of
the
right
and
blessedness
of
the
mere
doing
as
one
likes
of
the
affirming
oneself
and
oneself
just
as
it
is
people
of
the
aristocratic
class
want
to
affirm
their
ordinary
selves
their
likings
and
dislikings
people
of
the
the
same
people
of
the
the
same
by
our
everyday
selves
however
we
are
separate
personal
at
war
we
are
only
safe
from
one
tyranny
when
no
one
has
any
power
and
this
safety
in
its
turn
can
not
save
us
from
anarchy
and
when
therefore
anarchy
presents
itself
as
a
danger
to
us
we
know
not
where
to
turn
but
by
our
best
self
we
are
united
impersonal
at
harmony
we
are
in
no
peril
from
giving
authority
to
this
because
it
is
the
truest
friend
we
all
of
us
can
have
and
when
anarchy
is
a
danger
to
us
to
this
authority
we
may
turn
with
sure
trust
well
and
this
is
the
very
self
which
culture
or
the
study
of
perfection
seeks
to
develop
in
us
at
the
expense
of
our
old
untransformed
self
taking
pleasure
only
in
doing
what
it
likes
or
is
used
to
do
and
exposing
us
to
the
risk
of
clashing
with
every
one
else
who
is
doing
the
same
so
that
our
poor
culture
which
is
flouted
as
so
unpractical
leads
us
to
the
very
ideas
capable
of
meeting
the
great
want
of
our
present
embarrassed
times
we
want
an
authority
and
we
find
nothing
but
jealous
classes
checks
and
a
culture
suggests
the
idea
of
the
state
we
find
no
basis
for
a
firm
in
our
ordinary
selves
culture
suggests
one
to
us
in
our
best
self
it
can
not
but
acutely
try
a
tender
conscience
to
be
accused
in
a
practical
country
like
ours
of
keeping
aloof
from
the
work
and
hope
of
a
multitude
of
men
and
of
merely
toying
with
poetry
and
aesthetics
so
it
is
with
no
little
sense
of
relief
that
i
find
myself
thus
in
the
position
of
one
who
makes
a
contribution
in
aid
of
the
practical
necessities
of
our
times
the
great
thing
it
will
be
observed
is
to
find
our
best
self
and
to
seek
to
affirm
nothing
but
that
not
as
we
english
with
our
value
for
merely
being
free
and
busy
have
been
so
accustomed
to
do
resting
satisfied
with
a
self
which
comes
uppermost
long
before
our
best
self
and
affirming
that
with
blind
energy
in
short
to
go
back
yet
once
more
to
bishop
wilson
of
these
two
excellent
rules
of
bishop
wilson
for
a
man
guidance
firstly
never
go
against
the
best
light
you
have
secondly
take
care
that
your
light
be
not
darkness
we
english
have
followed
with
praiseworthy
zeal
the
first
rule
but
we
have
not
given
so
much
heed
to
the
second
we
have
gone
manfully
the
rev
cattle
and
the
rest
of
us
according
to
the
best
light
we
have
but
we
have
not
taken
enough
care
that
this
should
be
really
the
best
light
possible
for
us
that
it
should
not
be
darkness
and
our
honesty
being
very
great
conscience
has
whispered
to
us
that
the
light
we
were
following
our
ordinary
self
was
indeed
perhaps
only
an
inferior
self
only
darkness
and
that
it
would
not
do
to
impose
this
seriously
on
all
the
world
but
our
best
self
inspires
faith
and
is
capable
of
affording
a
serious
principle
of
authority
for
example
we
are
on
our
way
to
what
the
late
duke
of
wellington
with
his
strong
sagacity
foresaw
and
admirably
described
as
a
revolution
by
due
course
of
law
this
is
undoubtedly
if
we
are
still
to
live
and
grow
and
this
famous
nation
is
not
to
stagnate
and
dwindle
away
on
the
one
hand
or
on
the
other
to
perish
miserably
in
mere
anarchy
and
confusion
what
we
are
on
the
way
to
great
changes
there
must
be
for
a
revolution
can
not
accomplish
itself
without
great
changes
yet
order
there
must
be
for
without
order
a
revolution
can
not
accomplish
itself
by
due
course
of
law
so
whatever
brings
risk
of
tumult
and
disorder
multitudinous
processions
in
the
streets
of
our
crowded
towns
multitudinous
meetings
in
their
public
places
and
parks
demonstrations
perfectly
unnecessary
in
the
present
course
of
our
affairs
our
best
self
or
right
reason
plainly
enjoins
us
to
set
our
faces
against
it
enjoins
us
to
encourage
and
uphold
the
occupants
of
the
executive
power
whoever
they
may
be
in
firmly
prohibiting
them
but
it
does
this
clearly
and
resolutely
and
is
thus
a
real
principle
of
authority
because
it
does
it
with
a
free
conscience
because
in
thus
provisionally
strengthening
the
executive
power
it
knows
that
it
is
not
doing
this
merely
to
enable
sir
thomas
bateson
to
affirm
himself
as
against
bradlaugh
or
the
rev
cattle
to
affirm
himself
as
against
both
it
knows
that
it
is
stablishing
the
state
or
organ
of
our
collective
best
self
of
our
national
right
reason
and
it
has
the
testimony
of
conscience
that
it
is
stablishing
the
state
on
behalf
of
whatever
great
changes
are
needed
just
as
much
as
on
behalf
of
order
stablishing
it
to
deal
just
as
stringently

the
time
comes

chapter
iii
from
a
man
without
a
philosophy
no
one
can
expect
philosophical
completeness
therefore
i
may
observe
without
shame
that
in
trying
to
get
a
distinct
notion
of
our
aristocratic
our
middle
and
our
working
class
with
a
view
of
testing
the
claims
of
each
of
these
classes
to
become
a
centre
of
authority
i
have
omitted
i
find
to
complete
the
analysis
which
i
had
the
fancy
of
applying
and
have
not
shown
in
these
classes
as
well
as
the
virtuous
mean
and
the
excess
the
defect
also
i
do
not
know
that
the
omission
very
much
matters
still
as
clearness
is
the
one
merit
which
a
plain
unsystematic
writer
without
a
philosophy
can
hope
to
have
and
as
our
notion
of
the
three
great
english
classes
may
perhaps
be
made
clearer
if
we
see
their
distinctive
qualities
in
the
defect
as
well
as
in
the
excess
and
in
the
mean
let
us
try
before
proceeding
further
to
remedy
this
omission
it
is
manifest
if
the
perfect
and
virtuous
mean
of
that
fine
spirit
which
is
the
distinctive
quality
of
aristocracies
is
to
be
found
in
lord
elcho
chivalrous
style
and
its
excess
in
sir
thomas
bateson
turn
for
resistance
that
its
defect
must
lie
in
a
spirit
not
bold
and
high
enough
and
in
an
excessive
and
pusillanimous
unaptness
for
resistance
if
again
the
perfect
and
virtuous
mean
of
that
force
by
which
our
has
done
its
great
works
and
of
that
with
which
it
contemplates
itself
and
them
is
to
be
seen
in
the
performances
and
speeches
of
bazley
and
the
excess
of
that
force
and
that
in
the
performances
and
speeches
of
the
rev
cattle
then
it
is
manifest
that
their
defect
must
lie
in
a
helpless
inaptitude
for
the
great
works
of
the
class
and
in
a
poor
and
despicable
lack
of
its
to
be
chosen
to
exemplify
the
happy
mean
of
a
good
quality
or
set
of
good
qualities
is
evidently
a
praise
to
a
man
nay
to
be
chosen
to
exemplify
even
their
excess
is
a
kind
of
praise
therefore
i
could
have
no
hesitation
in
taking
lord
elcho
and
bazley
the
rev
cattle
and
sir
thomas
bateson
to
exemplify
respectively
the
mean
and
the
excess
of
aristocratic
and
qualities
but
perhaps
there
might
be
a
want
of
urbanity
in
singling
out
this
or
that
personage
as
the
representative
of
defect
therefore
i
shall
leave
the
defect
of
aristocracy
unillustrated
by
any
representative
man
but
with
oneself
one
may
always
without
impropriety
deal
quite
freely
and
indeed
this
sort
of
with
oneself
has
in
it
as
all
the
moralists
tell
us
something
very
wholesome
so
i
will
venture
to
humbly
offer
myself
as
an
illustration
of
defect
in
those
forces
and
qualities
which
make
our
what
it
is
the
too
reproaches
of
my
opponents
declare
how
little
i
have
lent
a
hand
to
the
great
works
of
the
for
it
is
evidently
these
works
and
my
slackness
at
them
which
are
meant
when
i
am
said
to
refuse
to
lend
a
hand
to
the
humble
operation
of
uprooting
certain
definite
evils
such
as
and
others
and
that
therefore
the
believers
in
action
grow
impatient
with
me
the
line
again
of
a
still
unsatisfied
seeker
which
i
have
followed
the
idea
of
of
growing
towards
some
measure
of
sweetness
and
light
not
yet
reached
is
evidently
at
clean
variance
with
the
perfect
current
in
my
class
the
class
and
may
serve
to
indicate
in
me
therefore
the
extreme
defect
of
this
feeling
but
these
confessions
though
salutary
are
bitter
and
unpleasant
to
pass
then
to
the
the
defect
of
this
class
would
be
the
falling
short
in
what
frederic
harrison
calls
those
bright
powers
of
sympathy
and
ready
powers
of
action
of
which
we
saw
in
odger
the
virtuous
mean
and
in
bradlaugh
the
excess
the
is
so
fast
growing
and
rising
at
the
present
time
that
instances
of
this
defect
can
not
well
be
now
very
common
perhaps
canning
needy
who
is
dead
and
therefore
can
not
be
pained
at
my
taking
him
for
an
illustration
may
serve
to
give
us
the
notion
of
defect
in
the
essential
quality
of
a
class
or
i
might
even
cite
since
though
he
is
alive
in
the
flesh
he
is
dead
to
all
heed
of
criticism
my
poor
old
poaching
friend
zephaniah
diggs
who
between
his
and
his
has
got
his
powers
of
sympathy
quite
dulled
and
his
powers
of
action
in
any
great
movement
of
his
class
hopelessly
impaired
but
examples
of
this
defect
belong
as
i
have
said
to
a
bygone
age
rather
than
to
the
present
the
same
desire
for
clearness
which
has
led
me
thus
to
extend
a
little
my
first
analysis
of
the
three
great
classes
of
english
society
prompts
me
also
to
make
my
nomenclature
for
them
a
little
fuller
with
a
view
to
making
it
thereby
more
clear
and
manageable
it
is
awkward
and
tiresome
to
be
always
saying
the
aristocratic
class
the
the
for
the
for
that
great
body
which
as
we
know
has
done
all
the
great
things
that
have
been
done
in
all
departments
and
which
is
to
be
conceived
as
chiefly
moving
between
its
two
cardinal
points
of
bazley
and
the
rev
cattle
but
inclining
in
the
mass
rather
towards
the
latter
than
the
former
for
this
class
we
have
a
designation
which
now
has
become
pretty
well
known
and
which
we
may
as
well
still
keep
for
them
the
designation
of
philistines
what
this
term
means
i
have
so
often
explained
that
i
need
not
repeat
it
here
for
the
aristocratic
class
conceived
mainly
as
a
body
moving
between
the
two
cardinal
points
of
lord
elcho
and
sir
thomas
bateson
but
as
a
whole
nearer
to
the
latter
than
the
former
we
have
as
yet
got
no
special
designation
almost
all
my
attention
has
naturally
been
concentrated
on
my
own
class
the
with
which
i
am
in
closest
sympathy
and
which
has
been
besides
the
great
power
of
our
day
and
has
had
its
praises
sung
by
all
speakers
and
newspapers
still
the
aristocratic
class
is
so
important
in
itself
and
the
weighty
functions
which
carlyle
proposes
at
the
present
critical
time
to
commit
to
it
must
add
so
much
to
its
importance
that
it
seems
neglectful
and
a
strong
instance
of
that
want
of
coherent
philosophic
method
for
which
frederic
harrison
blames
me
to
leave
the
aristocratic
class
so
much
without
notice
and
denomination
it
may
be
thought
that
the
characteristic
which
i
have
occasionally
mentioned
as
proper
to
aristocracies
their
natural
inaccessibility
as
children
of
the
established
fact
to
ideas
points
to
our
extending
to
this
class
also
the
designation
of
philistines
the
philistine
being
as
is
well
known
the
enemy
of
the
children
of
light
or
servants
of
the
idea
nevertheless
there
seems
to
be
an
inconvenience
in
thus
giving
one
and
the
same
designation
to
two
very
different
classes
and
besides
if
we
look
into
the
thing
closely
we
shall
find
that
the
term
philistine
conveys
a
sense
which
makes
it
more
peculiarly
appropriate
to
our
middle
class
than
to
our
aristocratic
for
philistine
gives
the
notion
of
something
particularly
and
perverse
in
the
resistance
to
light
and
its
children
and
therein
it
specially
suits
our
who
not
only
do
not
pursue
sweetness
and
light
but
who
prefer
to
them
that
sort
of
machinery
of
business
chapels
tea
meetings
and
addresses
from
murphy
and
the
rev
cattle
which
makes
up
the
dismal
and
illiberal
life
on
which
i
have
so
often
touched
but
the
aristocratic
class
has
actually
as
we
have
seen
in
its
politeness
a
kind
of
image
or
shadow
of
sweetness
and
as
for
light
if
it
does
not
pursue
light
it
is
not
that
it
perversely
cherishes
some
dismal
and
illiberal
existence
in
preference
to
light
but
it
is
seduced
from
following
light
by
those
mighty
and
eternal
seducers
of
our
race
which
weave
for
this
class
their
most
irresistible
charms
by
worldly
splendour
security
power
and
pleasure
these
seducers
are
exterior
goods
but
they
are
goods
and
he
who
is
hindered
by
them
from
caring
for
light
and
ideas
is
not
so
much
doing
what
is
perverse
as
what
is
natural
keeping
this
in
view
i
have
in
my
own
mind
often
indulged
myself
with
the
fancy
of
putting
side
by
side
with
the
idea
of
our
aristocratic
class
the
idea
of
the
barbarians
the
barbarians
to
whom
we
all
owe
so
much
and
who
reinvigorated
and
renewed
our
out
europe
had
as
is
eminent
merits
and
in
this
country
where
we
are
for
the
most
part
sprung
from
the
barbarians
we
have
never
had
the
prejudice
against
them
which
prevails
among
the
races
of
latin
origin
the
barbarians
brought
with
them
that
staunch
individualism
as
the
modern
phrase
is
and
that
passion
for
doing
as
one
likes
for
the
assertion
of
personal
liberty
which
appears
to
mr
bright
the
central
idea
of
english
life
and
of
which
we
have
at
any
rate
a
very
rich
supply
the
stronghold
and
natural
seat
of
this
passion
was
in
the
nobles
of
whom
our
aristocratic
class
are
the
inheritors
and
this
class
accordingly
have
signally
manifested
it
and
have
done
much
by
their
example
to
recommend
it
to
the
body
of
the
nation
who
already
indeed
had
it
in
their
blood
the
barbarians
again
had
the
passion
for
and
they
have
handed
it
on
to
our
aristocratic
class
who
of
this
passion
too
as
of
the
passion
for
asserting
one
personal
liberty
are
the
great
natural
stronghold
the
care
of
the
barbarians
for
the
body
and
for
all
manly
exercises
the
vigour
good
looks
and
fine
complexion
which
they
acquired
and
perpetuated
in
their
families
by
these
means
all
this
may
be
observed
still
in
our
aristocratic
class
the
chivalry
of
the
barbarians
with
its
characteristics
of
high
spirit
choice
manners
and
distinguished
bearing
what
is
this
but
the
beautiful
commencement
of
the
politeness
of
our
aristocratic
class
in
some
barbarian
noble
no
doubt
one
would
have
admired
if
one
could
have
been
then
alive
to
see
it
the
rudiments
of
lord
elcho
only
all
this
culture
to
call
it
by
that
name
of
the
barbarians
was
an
exterior
culture
mainly
it
consisted
principally
in
outward
gifts
and
graces
in
looks
manners
accomplishments
prowess
the
chief
inward
gifts
which
had
part
in
it
were
the
most
exterior
so
to
speak
of
inward
gifts
those
which
come
nearest
to
outward
ones
they
were
courage
a
high
spirit
far
within
and
unawakened
lay
a
whole
range
of
powers
of
thought
and
feeling
to
which
these
interesting
productions
of
nature
had
from
the
circumstances
of
their
life
no
access
making
allowances
for
the
difference
of
the
times
surely
we
can
observe
precisely
the
same
thing
now
in
our
aristocratic
class
in
general
its
culture
is
exterior
chiefly
all
the
exterior
graces
and
accomplishments
and
the
more
external
of
the
inward
virtues
seem
to
be
principally
its
portion
it
now
of
course
can
not
but
be
often
in
contact
with
those
studies
by
which
from
the
world
of
thought
and
feeling
true
culture
teaches
us
to
fetch
sweetness
and
light
but
its
hold
upon
these
very
studies
appears
remarkably
external
and
unable
to
exert
any
deep
power
upon
its
spirit
therefore
the
one
insufficiency
which
we
noted
in
the
perfect
mean
of
this
class
lord
elcho
was
an
insufficiency
of
light
and
owing
to
the
same
causes
does
not
a
subtle
criticism
lead
us
to
make
even
on
the
good
looks
and
politeness
of
our
aristocratic
class
the
one
qualifying
remark
that
in
these
charming
gifts
there
should
perhaps
be
for
ideal
perfection
a
shade
more
soul
i
often
therefore
when
i
want
to
distinguish
clearly
the
aristocratic
class
from
the
philistines
proper
or
name
the
former
in
my
own
mind
the
barbarians
and
when
i
go
through
the
country
and
see
this
and
that
beautiful
and
imposing
seat
of
theirs
crowning
the
landscape
there
i
say
to
myself
is
a
great
fortified
post
of
the
barbarians
it
is
obvious
that
that
part
of
the
which
working
diligently
by
the
light
of
gooch
golden
rule
looks
forward
to
the
happy
day
when
it
will
sit
on
thrones
with
bazley
and
other
potentates
to
survey
as
mr
bright
beautifully
says
the
cities
it
has
built
the
railroads
it
has
made
the
manufactures
it
has
produced
the
cargoes
which
freight
the
ships
of
the
greatest
mercantile
navy
the
world
has
ever
seen
it
is
obvious
i
say
that
this
part
of
the
is
or
is
in
a
fair
way
to
be
one
in
spirit
with
the
industrial
it
is
notorious
that
our
liberals
have
long
looked
forward
to
this
consummation
when
the
shall
join
forces
with
them
aid
them
heartily
to
carry
forward
their
great
works
go
in
a
body
to
their
meetings
and
in
short
enable
them
to
bring
about
their
millennium
that
part
of
the
therefore
which
does
really
seem
to
lend
itself
to
these
great
aims
may
with
propriety
be
numbered
by
us
among
the
philistines
that
part
of
it
again
which
so
much
occupies
the
attention
of
philanthropists
at
present
the
part
which
gives
all
its
energies
to
organising
itself
through
unions
and
other
means
so
as
to
constitute
first
a
great
class
power
independent
of
the
middle
and
aristocratic
classes
and
then
by
dint
of
numbers
give
the
law
to
them
and
itself
reign
absolutely
this
lively
and
interesting
part
must
also
according
to
our
definition
go
with
the
philistines
because
it
is
its
class
and
its
which
it
seeks
to
affirm
its
ordinary
self
not
its
best
self
and
it
is
a
machinery
an
industrial
machinery
and
power
and
and
other
external
goods
which
fill
its
thoughts
and
not
an
inward
perfection
it
is
wholly
occupied
according
to
plato
subtle
expression
with
the
things
of
itself
and
not
its
real
self
with
the
things
of
the
state
and
not
the
real
state
but
that
vast
portion
lastly
of
the
which
raw
and
has
long
lain
amidst
its
poverty
and
squalor
and
is
now
issuing
from
its
to
assert
an
englishman
privilege
of
doing
as
he
likes
and
is
beginning
to
perplex
us
by
marching
where
it
likes
meeting
where
it
likes
bawling
what
it
likes
breaking
what
it
likes
to
this
vast
residuum
we
may
with
great
propriety
give
the
name
of
populace
thus
we
have
got
three
distinct
terms
barbarians
philistines
populace
to
denote
roughly
the
three
great
classes
into
which
our
society
is
divided
and
though
this
humble
attempt
at
a
scientific
nomenclature
falls
no
doubt
very
far
short
in
precision
of
what
might
be
required
from
a
writer
equipped
with
a
complete
and
coherent
philosophy
yet
from
a
notoriously
unsystematic
and
unpretending
writer
it
will
i
trust
be
accepted
as
sufficient
but
in
using
this
new
and
i
hope
convenient
division
of
english
society
two
things
are
to
be
borne
in
mind
the
first
is
that
since
under
all
our
class
divisions
there
is
a
common
basis
of
human
nature
therefore
in
every
one
of
us
whether
we
be
properly
barbarians
philistines
or
populace
there
exists
sometimes
only
in
germ
and
potentially
sometimes
more
or
less
developed
the
same
tendencies
and
passions
which
have
made
our
of
other
classes
what
they
are
this
consideration
is
very
important
because
it
has
great
influence
in
begetting
that
spirit
of
indulgence
which
is
a
necessary
part
of
sweetness
and
which
indeed
when
our
culture
is
complete
is
as
i
have
said
inexhaustible
thus
an
english
barbarian
who
examines
himself
will
in
general
find
himself
to
be
not
so
entirely
a
barbarian
but
that
he
has
in
him
also
something
of
the
philistine
and
even
something
of
the
populace
as
well
and
the
same
with
englishmen
of
the
two
other
classes
this
is
an
experience
which
we
may
all
verify
every
day
for
instance
i
myself
i
again
take
myself
as
a
sort
of
corpus
vile
to
serve
for
illustration
in
a
matter
where
serving
for
illustration
may
not
by
every
one
be
thought
agreeable
i
myself
am
properly
a
philistine
swinburne
would
add
the
son
of
a
philistine
and
though
through
circumstances
which
will
perhaps
one
day
be
known
if
ever
the
affecting
history
of
my
conversion
comes
to
be
written
i
have
for
the
most
part
broken
with
the
ideas
and
the
of
my
own
class
yet
i
have
not
on
that
account
been
brought
much
the
nearer
to
the
ideas
and
works
of
the
barbarians
or
of
the
populace
nevertheless
i
never
take
a
gun
or
a
in
my
hands
without
feeling
that
i
have
in
the
ground
of
my
nature
the
seeds
which
fostered
by
circumstances
do
so
much
to
make
the
barbarian
and
that
with
the
barbarian
advantages
i
might
have
rivalled
him
place
me
in
one
of
his
great
fortified
posts
with
these
seeds
of
a
love
for
sown
in
my
nature
with
all
the
means
of
developing
them
with
all
pleasures
at
my
command
with
most
whom
i
met
deferring
to
me
every
one
i
met
smiling
on
me
and
with
every
appearance
of
permanence
and
security
before
me
and
behind
me
then
i
too
might
have
grown
i
feel
into
a
very
passable
child
of
the
established
fact
of
commendable
spirit
and
politeness
and
at
the
same
time
a
little
inaccessible
to
ideas
and
light
not
of
course
with
either
the
eminent
fine
spirit
of
lord
elcho
or
the
eminent
power
of
resistance
of
sir
thomas
bateson
but
according
to
the
measure
of
the
common
run
of
mankind
something
between
the
two
and
as
to
the
populace
who
whether
he
be
barbarian
or
philistine
can
look
at
them
without
sympathy
when
he
remembers
how
often
every
time
that
we
snatch
up
a
vehement
opinion
in
ignorance
and
passion
every
time
that
we
long
to
crush
an
adversary
by
sheer
violence
every
time
that
we
are
envious
every
time
that
we
are
brutal
every
time
that
we
adore
mere
power
or
success
every
time
that
we
add
our
voice
to
swell
a
blind
clamour
against
some
unpopular
personage
every
time
that
we
trample
savagely
on
the
fallen
he
has
found
in
his
own
bosom
the
eternal
spirit
of
the
populace
and
that
there
needs
only
a
little
help
from
circumstances
to
make
it
triumph
in
him
untameably
the
second
thing
to
be
borne
in
mind
i
have
indicated
several
times
already
it
is
this
all
of
us
so
far
as
we
are
barbarians
philistines
or
populace
imagine
happiness
to
consist
in
doing
what
one
ordinary
self
likes
what
one
ordinary
self
likes
differs
according
to
the
class
to
which
one
belongs
and
has
its
severer
and
its
lighter
side
always
however
remaining
machinery
and
nothing
more
the
graver
self
of
the
barbarian
likes
honours
and
consideration
his
more
relaxed
self
and
pleasure
the
graver
self
of
one
kind
of
philistine
likes
business
and
making
his
more
relaxed
self
comfort
and
of
another
kind
of
philistine
the
graver
self
likes
trades
unions
the
relaxed
self
deputations
or
hearing
odger
speak
the
sterner
self
of
the
populace
likes
bawling
hustling
and
smashing
the
lighter
self
beer
but
in
each
class
there
are
born
a
certain
number
of
natures
with
a
curiosity
about
their
best
self
with
a
bent
for
seeing
things
as
they
are
for
disentangling
themselves
from
machinery
for
simply
concerning
themselves
with
reason
and
the
will
of
god
and
doing
their
best
to
make
these
prevail
for
the
pursuit
in
a
word
of
perfection
to
certain
manifestations
of
this
love
for
perfection
mankind
have
accustomed
themselves
to
give
the
name
of
genius
implying
by
this
name
something
original
and
bestowed
in
the
passion
but
the
passion
is
to
be
found
far
beyond
those
manifestations
of
it
to
which
the
world
usually
gives
the
name
of
genius
and
in
which
there
is
for
the
most
part
a
talent
of
some
kind
or
other
a
special
and
striking
faculty
of
execution
informed
by
the
ardour
or
genius
it
is
to
be
found
in
many
manifestations
besides
these
and
may
best
be
called
as
we
have
called
it
the
love
and
pursuit
of
perfection
culture
being
the
true
nurse
of
the
pursuing
love
and
sweetness
and
light
the
true
character
of
the
pursued
perfection
natures
with
this
bent
emerge
in
all
classes
among
the
barbarians
among
the
philistines
among
the
populace
and
this
bent
always
tends
as
i
have
said
to
take
them
out
of
their
class
and
to
make
their
distinguishing
characteristic
not
their
barbarianism
or
their
philistinism
but
their
humanity
they
have
in
general
a
rough
time
of
it
in
their
lives
but
they
are
sown
more
abundantly
than
one
might
think
they
appear
where
and
when
one
least
expects
it
they
set
up
a
fire
which
enfilades
so
to
speak
the
class
with
which
they
are
ranked
and
in
general
by
the
extrication
of
their
best
self
as
the
self
to
develope
and
by
the
simplicity
of
the
ends
fixed
by
them
as
paramount
they
hinder
the
unchecked
predominance
of
that
which
is
the
affirmation
of
our
ordinary
self
and
seasonably
disconcert
mankind
in
their
worship
of
machinery
therefore
when
we
speak
of
ourselves
as
divided
into
barbarians
philistines
and
populace
we
must
be
understood
always
to
imply
that
within
each
of
these
classes
there
are
a
certain
number
of
aliens
if
we
may
so
call
them
persons
who
are
mainly
led
not
by
their
class
spirit
but
by
a
general
humane
spirit
by
the
love
of
human
perfection
and
that
this
number
is
capable
of
being
diminished
or
augmented
i
mean
the
number
of
those
who
will
succeed
in
developing
this
happy
instinct
will
be
greater
or
smaller
in
proportion
both
to
the
force
of
the
original
instinct
within
them
and
to
the
hindrance
or
encouragement
which
it
meets
with
from
without
in
almost
all
who
have
it
it
is
mixed
with
some
infusion
of
the
spirit
of
an
ordinary
self
some
quantity
of
and
even
as
has
been
shown
of
more
than
one
at
the
same
time
so
that
in
general
the
extrication
of
the
best
self
the
predominance
of
the
humane
instinct
will
very
much
depend
upon
its
meeting
or
not
with
what
is
fitted
to
help
and
elicit
it
at
a
moment
therefore
when
it
is
agreed
that
we
want
a
source
of
authority
and
when
it
seems
probable
that
the
right
source
is
our
best
self
it
becomes
of
vast
importance
to
see
whether
or
not
the
things
around
us
are
in
general
such
as
to
help
and
elicit
our
best
self
and
if
they
are
not
to
see
why
they
are
not
and
the
most
promising
way
of
mending
them
now
it
is
clear
that
the
very
absence
of
any
powerful
authority
amongst
us
and
the
prevalent
doctrine
of
the
duty
and
happiness
of
doing
as
one
likes
and
asserting
our
personal
liberty
must
tend
to
prevent
the
erection
of
any
very
strict
standard
of
excellence
the
belief
in
any
very
paramount
authority
of
right
reason
the
recognition
of
our
best
self
as
anything
very
recondite
and
hard
to
come
at
it
may
be
as
i
have
said
a
proof
of
our
honesty
that
we
do
not
attempt
to
give
to
our
ordinary
self
as
we
have
it
in
action
predominant
authority
and
to
impose
its
rule
upon
other
people
but
it
is
evident
also
that
it
is
not
easy
with
our
style
of
proceeding
to
get
beyond
the
notion
of
an
ordinary
self
at
all
or
to
get
the
paramount
authority
of
a
commanding
best
self
or
right
reason
recognised
the
learned
martinus
scriblerus
well
says
the
taste
of
the
bathos
is
implanted
by
nature
itself
in
the
soul
of
man
till
perverted
by
custom
or
example
he
is
taught
or
rather
compelled
to
relish
the
sublime
but
with
us
everything
seems
directed
to
prevent
any
such
perversion
of
us
by
custom
or
example
as
might
compel
us
to
relish
the
sublime
by
all
means
we
are
encouraged
to
keep
our
natural
taste
for
the
bathos
unimpaired
i
have
formerly
pointed
out
how
in
literature
the
absence
of
any
authoritative
centre
like
an
academy
tends
to
do
this
each
section
of
the
public
has
its
own
literary
organ
and
the
mass
of
the
public
is
without
any
suspicion
that
the
value
of
these
organs
is
relative
to
their
being
nearer
a
certain
ideal
centre
of
correct
information
taste
and
intelligence
or
farther
away
from
it
i
have
said
that
within
certain
limits
which
any
one
who
is
likely
to
read
this
will
have
no
difficulty
in
drawing
for
himself
my
old
adversary
the
saturday
review
may
on
matters
of
literature
and
taste
be
fairly
enough
regarded
relatively
to
a
great
number
of
newspapers
which
treat
these
matters
as
a
kind
of
organ
of
reason
but
i
remember
once
conversing
with
a
company
of
nonconformist
admirers
of
some
lecturer
who
had
let
off
a
great
which
the
saturday
review
said
was
all
noise
and
false
lights
and
feeling
my
way
as
tenderly
as
i
could
about
the
effect
of
this
unfavourable
judgment
upon
those
with
whom
i
was
conversing
oh
said
one
who
was
their
spokesman
with
the
most
tranquil
air
of
conviction
it
is
true
the
saturday
review
abuses
the
lecture
but
the
british
banner
i
am
not
quite
sure
it
was
the
british
banner
but
it
was
some
newspaper
of
that
stamp
says
that
the
saturday
review
is
quite
wrong
the
speaker
had
evidently
no
notion
that
there
was
a
scale
of
value
for
judgments
on
these
topics
and
that
the
judgments
of
the
saturday
review
ranked
high
on
this
scale
and
those
of
the
british
banner
low
the
taste
of
the
bathos
implanted
by
nature
in
the
literary
judgments
of
man
had
never
in
my
friend
case
encountered
any
let
or
hindrance
just
the
same
in
religion
as
in
literature
we
have
most
of
us
little
idea
of
a
high
standard
to
choose
our
guides
by
of
a
great
and
profound
spirit
which
is
an
authority
while
inferior
spirits
are
none
it
is
enough
to
give
importance
to
things
that
this
or
that
person
says
them
decisively
and
has
a
large
following
of
some
strong
kind
when
he
says
them
this
habit
of
ours
is
very
well
shown
in
that
able
and
interesting
work
of
hepworth
dixon
which
we
were
all
reading
lately
the
mormons
by
one
of
themselves
here
again
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
my
memory
serves
me
as
to
the
exact
title
but
i
mean
the
book
in
which
hepworth
dixon
described
the
mormons
and
other
similar
religious
bodies
in
america
with
so
much
detail
and
such
warm
sympathy
in
this
work
it
seems
enough
for
dixon
that
this
or
that
doctrine
has
its
rabbi
who
talks
big
to
him
has
a
staunch
body
of
disciples
and
above
all
has
plenty
of
rifles
that
there
are
any
further
stricter
tests
to
be
applied
to
a
doctrine
before
it
is
pronounced
important
never
seems
to
occur
to
him
it
is
easy
to
say
he
writes
of
the
mormons
that
these
saints
are
dupes
and
fanatics
to
laugh
at
joe
smith
and
his
church
but
what
then
the
great
facts
remain
young
and
his
people
are
at
utah
a
church
of
souls
an
army
of
rifles
but
if
the
followers
of
a
doctrine
are
really
dupes
or
worse
and
its
promulgators
are
really
fanatics
or
worse
it
gives
the
doctrine
no
seriousness
or
authority
the
more
that
there
should
be
found
souls
of
the
innumerable
multitude
with
a
natural
taste
for
the
bathos
to
hold
it
and
rifles
to
defend
it
and
again
of
another
religious
organisation
in
america
a
fair
and
open
field
is
not
to
be
refused
when
hosts
so
mighty
throw
down
wager
of
battle
on
behalf
of
what
they
hold
to
be
true
however
strange
their
faith
may
seem
a
fair
and
open
field
is
not
to
be
refused
to
any
speaker
but
this
solemn
way
of
heralding
him
is
quite
out
of
place
unless
he
has
for
the
best
reason
and
spirit
of
man
some
significance
well
but
says
hepworth
dixon
a
theory
which
has
been
accepted
by
men
like
judge
edmonds
hare
elder
frederick
and
professor
bush
and
again
such
are
in
brief
the
bases
of
what
newman
weeks
sarah
horton
deborah
butler
and
the
associated
brethren
proclaimed
in
rolt
hall
as
the
new
covenant
if
he
was
summing
up
an
account
of
the
teaching
of
plato
or
paul
hepworth
dixon
could
not
be
more
earnestly
reverential
but
the
question
is
have
personages
like
judge
edmonds
and
newman
weeks
and
elderess
polly
and
elderess
antoinette
and
the
rest
of
hepworth
dixon
heroes
and
heroines
anything
of
the
weight
and
significance
for
the
best
reason
and
spirit
of
man
that
plato
and
paul
have
evidently
they
at
present
have
not
and
a
very
small
taste
of
them
and
their
doctrines
ought
to
have
convinced
hepworth
dixon
that
they
never
could
have
but
says
he
the
magnetic
power
which
shakerism
is
exercising
on
american
thought
would
of
itself
compel
us
and
so
on
now
as
far
as
real
thought
is
concerned
thought
which
affects
the
best
reason
and
spirit
of
man
the
scientific
thought
of
the
world
the
only
thought
which
deserves
speaking
of
in
this
solemn
way
america
has
up
to
the
present
time
been
hardly
more
than
a
province
of
england
and
even
now
would
not
herself
claim
to
be
more
than
abreast
of
england
and
of
this
only
real
human
thought
english
thought
itself
is
not
just
now
as
we
must
all
admit
one
of
the
most
significant
factors
neither
then
can
american
thought
be
and
the
magnetic
power
which
shakerism
exercises
on
american
thought
is
about
as
important
for
the
best
reason
and
spirit
of
man
as
the
magnetic
power
which
murphy
exercises
on
birmingham
protestantism
and
as
we
shall
never
get
rid
of
our
natural
taste
for
the
bathos
in
religion
never
get
access
to
a
best
self
and
right
reason
which
may
stand
as
a
serious
authority
by
treating
murphy
as
his
own
disciples
treat
him
seriously
and
as
if
he
was
as
much
an
authority
as
any
one
else
so
we
shall
never
get
rid
of
it
while
our
able
and
popular
writers
treat
their
joe
smiths
and
deborah
butlers
with
their
so
many
thousand
souls
and
so
many
thousand
rifles
in
the
like
exaggerated
and
misleading
manner
and
so
do
their
best
to
confirm
us
in
a
bad
mental
habit
to
which
we
are
already
too
prone
if
our
habits
make
it
hard
for
us
to
come
at
the
idea
of
a
high
best
self
of
a
paramount
authority
in
literature
or
religion
how
much
more
do
they
make
this
hard
in
the
sphere
of
politics
in
other
countries
the
governors
not
depending
so
immediately
on
the
favour
of
the
governed
have
everything
to
urge
them
if
they
know
anything
of
right
reason
and
it
is
at
least
supposed
that
governors
should
know
more
of
this
than
the
mass
of
the
governed
to
set
it
authoritatively
before
the
community
but
our
whole
scheme
of
government
being
representative
every
one
of
our
governors
has
all
possible
temptation
instead
of
setting
up
before
the
governed
who
elect
him
and
on
whose
favour
he
depends
a
high
standard
of
right
reason
to
accommodate
himself
as
much
as
possible
to
their
natural
taste
for
the
bathos
and
even
if
he
tries
to
go
counter
to
it
to
proceed
in
this
with
so
much
flattering
and
coaxing
that
they
shall
not
suspect
their
ignorance
and
prejudices
to
be
anything
very
unlike
right
reason
or
their
natural
taste
for
the
bathos
to
differ
much
from
a
relish
for
the
sublime
every
one
is
thus
in
every
possible
way
encouraged
to
trust
in
his
own
heart
but
he
that
trusteth
in
his
own
heart
says
the
wise
man
is
a
fool
and
at
any
rate
this
which
bishop
wilson
says
is
undeniably
true
the
number
of
those
who
need
to
be
awakened
is
far
greater
than
that
of
those
who
need
comfort
but
in
our
political
system
everybody
is
comforted
our
guides
and
governors
who
have
to
be
elected
by
the
influence
of
the
barbarians
and
who
depend
on
their
favour
sing
the
praises
of
the
barbarians
and
say
all
the
smooth
things
that
can
be
said
of
them
with
tennyson
they
celebrate
the
great
shouldered
genial
englishman
with
his
sense
of
duty
his
reverence
for
the
laws
and
his
patient
force
who
saves
us
from
the
revolts
republics
revolutions
most
no
graver
than
a
schoolboy
barring
out
which
upset
other
and
less
nations
our
guides
who
are
chosen
by
the
philistines
and
who
have
to
look
to
their
favour
tell
the
philistines
how
all
the
world
knows
that
the
great
of
this
country
supplies
the
mind
the
will
and
the
power
requisite
for
all
the
great
and
good
things
that
have
to
be
done
and
congratulate
them
on
their
earnest
good
sense
which
penetrates
through
sophisms
ignores
commonplaces
and
gives
to
conventional
illusions
their
true
value
our
guides
who
look
to
the
favour
of
the
populace
tell
them
that
theirs
are
the
brightest
powers
of
sympathy
and
the
readiest
powers
of
action
harsh
things
are
said
too
no
doubt
against
all
the
great
classes
of
the
community
but
these
things
so
evidently
come
from
a
hostile
class
and
are
so
manifestly
dictated
by
the
passions
and
prepossessions
of
a
hostile
class
and
not
by
right
reason
that
they
make
no
serious
impression
on
those
at
whom
they
are
launched
but
slide
easily
off
their
minds
for
instance
when
the
reform
league
orators
inveigh
against
our
cruel
and
bloated
aristocracy
these
invectives
so
evidently
show
the
passions
and
point
of
view
of
the
populace
that
they
do
not
sink
into
the
minds
of
those
at
whom
they
are
addressed
or
awaken
any
thought
or
in
them
again
when
sir
thomas
bateson
describes
the
philistines
and
the
populace
as
influenced
with
a
kind
of
hideous
mania
for
emasculating
the
aristocracy
that
reproach
so
clearly
comes
from
the
wrath
and
excited
imagination
of
the
barbarians
that
it
does
not
much
set
the
philistines
and
the
populace
thinking
or
when
lowe
calls
the
populace
drunken
and
venal
he
so
evidently
calls
them
this
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
for
his
philistine
or
parliament
which
has
done
so
many
great
and
heroic
works
and
is
now
threatened
with
mixture
and
debasement
that
the
populace
do
not
lay
his
words
seriously
to
heart
so
the
voice
which
makes
a
permanent
impression
on
each
of
our
classes
is
the
voice
of
its
friends
and
this
is
from
the
nature
of
things
as
i
have
said
a
comforting
voice
the
barbarians
remain
in
the
belief
that
the
great
shouldered
genial
englishman
may
be
well
satisfied
with
himself
the
philistines
remain
in
the
belief
that
the
great
of
this
country
with
its
earnest
penetrating
through
sophisms
and
ignoring
commonplaces
may
be
well
satisfied
with
itself
the
populace
that
the
with
his
bright
powers
of
sympathy
and
ready
powers
of
action
may
be
well
satisfied
with
himself
what
hope
at
this
rate
of
extinguishing
the
taste
of
the
bathos
implanted
by
nature
itself
in
the
soul
of
man
or
of
inculcating
the
belief
that
excellence
dwells
among
high
and
steep
rocks
and
can
only
be
reached
by
those
who
sweat
blood
to
reach
her
but
it
will
be
said
perhaps
that
candidates
for
political
influence
and
leadership
who
thus
caress
the
of
those
whose
suffrages
they
desire
know
quite
well
that
they
are
not
saying
the
sheer
truth
as
reason
sees
it
but
that
they
are
using
a
sort
of
conventional
language
or
what
we
call
which
is
essential
to
the
working
of
representative
institutions
and
therefore
i
suppose
we
ought
rather
to
say
with
figaro
qui
trompe
ici
now
i
admit
that
often
but
not
always
when
our
governors
say
smooth
things
to
the
of
the
class
whose
political
support
they
want
they
know
very
well
that
they
are
overstepping
by
a
long
stride
the
bounds
of
truth
and
soberness
and
while
they
talk
they
in
a
manner
no
doubt
put
their
tongue
in
their
cheek
not
always
because
when
a
barbarian
appeals
to
his
own
class
to
make
him
their
representative
and
give
him
political
power
he
when
he
pleases
their
by
extolling
genial
englishmen
with
their
sense
of
duty
reverence
for
the
laws
and
patient
force
pleases
his
own
and
extols
himself
and
is
therefore
himself
ensnared
by
his
own
smooth
words
and
so
too
when
a
philistine
wants
to
represent
his
brother
philistines
and
extols
the
earnest
good
sense
which
characterises
manchester
and
supplies
the
mind
the
will
and
the
power
as
the
daily
news
eloquently
says
requisite
for
all
the
great
and
good
things
that
have
to
be
done
he
intoxicates
and
deludes
himself
as
well
as
his
brother
philistines
who
hear
him
but
it
is
true
that
a
barbarian
often
wants
the
political
support
of
the
philistines
and
he
unquestionably
when
he
flatters
the
of
philistinism
and
extols
in
the
approved
fashion
its
energy
enterprise
and
reliance
knows
that
he
is
talking
and
so
to
say
puts
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
on
all
matters
where
nonconformity
and
its
catchwords
are
concerned
this
insincerity
of
barbarians
needing
nonconformist
support
and
therefore
flattering
the
of
nonconformity
and
repeating
its
catchwords
without
the
least
real
belief
in
them
is
very
noticeable
when
the
nonconformists
in
a
transport
of
blind
zeal
threw
out
sir
james
graham
useful
education
clauses
in
of
their
parliamentary
representatives
no
doubt
who
cried
aloud
against
trampling
on
the
religious
liberty
of
the
dissenters
by
taking
the
money
of
dissenters
to
teach
the
tenets
of
the
church
of
england
put
their
tongue
in
their
cheek
while
they
so
cried
out
and
perhaps
there
is
even
a
sort
of
motion
of
frederic
harrison
tongue
towards
his
cheek
when
he
talks
of
the
shriek
of
superstition
and
tells
the
class
that
theirs
are
the
brightest
powers
of
sympathy
and
the
readiest
powers
of
action
but
the
point
on
which
i
would
insist
is
that
this
involuntary
tribute
to
truth
and
soberness
on
the
part
of
certain
of
our
governors
and
guides
never
reaches
at
all
the
mass
of
us
governed
to
serve
as
a
lesson
to
us
to
abate
our
and
to
awaken
in
us
a
suspicion
that
our
favourite
prejudices
may
be
to
a
higher
reason
all
nonsense
whatever
goes
on
among
the
more
intelligent
of
our
leaders
we
do
not
see
it
and
we
are
left
to
believe
that
not
only
in
our
own
eyes
but
in
the
eyes
of
our
representative
and
ruling
men
there
is
nothing
more
admirable
than
our
ordinary
self
whatever
our
ordinary
self
happens
to
be
barbarian
philistine
or
populace
thus
everything
in
our
political
life
tends
to
hide
from
us
that
there
is
anything
wiser
than
our
ordinary
selves
and
to
prevent
our
getting
the
notion
of
a
paramount
right
reason
royalty
itself
in
its
idea
the
expression
of
the
collective
nation
and
a
sort
of
constituted
witness
to
its
best
mind
we
try
to
turn
into
a
kind
of
grand
advertising
van
to
give
publicity
and
credit
to
the
inventions
sound
or
unsound
of
the
ordinary
self
of
individuals
i
remember
when
i
was
in
north
germany
having
this
very
strongly
brought
to
my
mind
in
the
matter
of
schools
and
their
institution
in
prussia
the
best
schools
are
crown
patronage
schools
as
they
are
called
schools
which
have
been
established
and
endowed
and
new
ones
are
to
this
day
being
established
and
endowed
by
the
sovereign
himself
out
of
his
own
revenues
to
be
under
the
direct
control
and
management
of
him
or
of
those
representing
him
and
to
serve
as
types
of
what
schools
should
be
the
sovereign
as
his
position
raises
him
above
many
prejudices
and
littlenesses
and
as
he
can
always
have
at
his
disposal
the
best
advice
has
evident
advantages
over
private
founders
in
well
planning
and
directing
a
school
while
at
the
same
time
his
great
means
and
his
great
influence
secure
to
a
planned
school
of
his
credit
and
authority
this
is
what
in
north
germany
the
governors
do
in
the
matter
of
education
for
the
governed
and
one
may
say
that
they
thus
give
the
governed
a
lesson
and
draw
out
in
them
the
idea
of
a
right
reason
higher
than
the
suggestions
of
an
ordinary
man
ordinary
self
but
in
england
how
different
is
the
part
which
in
this
matter
our
governors
are
accustomed
to
play
the
licensed
victuallers
or
the
commercial
travellers
propose
to
make
a
school
for
their
children
and
i
suppose
in
the
matter
of
schools
one
may
call
the
licensed
victuallers
or
the
commercial
travellers
ordinary
men
with
their
natural
taste
for
the
bathos
still
strong
and
a
sovereign
with
the
advice
of
men
like
wilhelm
von
humboldt
or
schleiermacher
may
in
this
matter
be
a
better
judge
and
nearer
to
right
reason
and
it
will
be
allowed
probably
that
right
reason
would
suggest
that
to
have
a
sheer
school
of
licensed
victuallers
children
or
a
sheer
school
of
commercial
travellers
children
and
to
bring
them
all
up
not
only
at
home
but
at
school
too
in
a
kind
of
odour
of
licensed
victualism
or
of
bagmanism
is
not
a
wise
training
to
give
to
these
children
and
in
germany
i
have
said
the
action
of
the
national
guides
or
governors
is
to
suggest
and
provide
a
better
but
in
england
the
action
of
the
national
guides
or
governors
is
for
a
royal
prince
or
a
great
minister
to
go
down
to
the
opening
of
the
licensed
victuallers
or
of
the
commercial
travellers
school
to
take
the
chair
to
extol
the
energy
and
of
the
licensed
victuallers
or
the
commercial
travellers
to
be
all
of
their
way
of
thinking
to
predict
full
success
to
their
schools
and
never
so
much
as
to
hint
to
them
that
they
are
doing
a
very
foolish
thing
and
that
the
right
way
to
go
to
work
with
their
children
education
is
quite
different
and
it
is
the
same
in
almost
every
department
of
affairs
while
on
the
continent
the
idea
prevails
that
it
is
the
business
of
the
heads
and
representatives
of
the
nation
by
virtue
of
their
superior
means
power
and
information
to
set
an
example
and
to
provide
suggestions
of
right
reason
among
us
the
idea
is
that
the
business
of
the
heads
and
representatives
of
the
nation
is
to
do
nothing
of
the
kind
but
to
applaud
the
natural
taste
for
the
bathos
showing
itself
vigorously
in
any
part
of
the
community
and
to
encourage
its
works
now
i
do
not
say
that
the
political
system
of
foreign
countries
has
not
inconveniences
which
may
outweigh
the
inconveniences
of
our
own
political
system
nor
am
i
the
least
proposing
to
get
rid
of
our
own
political
system
and
to
adopt
theirs
but
a
sound
centre
of
authority
being
what
in
this
disquisition
we
have
been
led
to
seek
and
right
reason
or
our
best
self
appearing
alone
to
offer
such
a
sound
centre
of
authority
it
is
necessary
to
take
note
of
the
chief
impediments
which
hinder
in
this
country
the
extrication
or
recognition
of
this
right
reason
as
a
paramount
authority
with
a
view
to
afterwards
trying
in
what
way
they
can
best
be
removed
this
being
borne
in
mind
i
proceed
to
remark
how
not
only
do
we
get
no
suggestions
of
right
reason
and
no
rebukes
of
our
ordinary
self
from
our
governors
but
a
kind
of
philosophical
theory
is
widely
spread
among
us
to
the
effect
that
there
is
no
such
thing
at
all
as
a
best
self
and
a
right
reason
having
claim
to
paramount
authority
or
at
any
rate
no
such
thing
ascertainable
and
capable
of
being
made
use
of
and
that
there
is
nothing
but
an
infinite
number
of
ideas
and
works
of
our
ordinary
selves
and
suggestions
of
our
natural
taste
for
the
bathos
pretty
equal
in
value
which
are
doomed
either
to
an
irreconcileable
conflict
or
else
to
a
perpetual
give
and
take
and
that
wisdom
consists
in
choosing
the
give
and
take
rather
than
the
conflict
and
in
sticking
to
our
choice
with
patience
and
good
humour
and
on
the
other
hand
we
have
another
philosophical
theory
rife
among
us
to
the
effect
that
without
the
labour
of
perverting
ourselves
by
custom
or
example
to
relish
right
reason
but
by
continuing
all
of
us
to
follow
freely
our
natural
taste
for
the
bathos
we
shall
by
the
mercy
of
providence
and
by
a
kind
of
natural
tendency
of
things
come
in
due
time
to
relish
and
follow
right
reason
the
great
promoters
of
these
philosophical
theories
are
our
newspapers
which
no
less
than
our
parliamentary
representatives
may
be
said
to
act
the
part
of
guides
and
governors
to
us
and
these
favourite
doctrines
of
theirs
i
call
or
should
call
if
the
doctrines
were
not
preached
by
authorities
i
so
much
respect
the
first
a
peculiarly
british
form
of
atheism
the
second
a
peculiarly
british
form
of
quietism
the
melancholy
doctrine
is
preached
in
the
times
with
great
clearness
and
force
of
style
indeed
it
is
well
known
from
the
example
of
the
poet
lucretius
and
others
what
great
masters
of
style
the
atheistic
doctrine
has
always
counted
among
its
promulgators
it
is
of
no
use
says
the
times
for
us
to
attempt
to
force
upon
our
neighbours
our
several
likings
and
dislikings
we
must
take
things
as
they
are
everybody
has
his
own
little
vision
of
religious
or
civil
perfection
under
the
evident
impossibility
of
satisfying
everybody
we
agree
to
take
our
stand
on
equal
laws
and
on
a
system
as
open
and
liberal
as
is
possible
the
result
is
that
everybody
has
more
liberty
of
action
and
of
speaking
here
than
anywhere
else
in
the
old
world
we
come
again
here
upon
roebuck
celebrated
definition
of
happiness
on
which
i
have
so
often
commented
i
look
around
me
and
ask
what
is
the
state
of
england
is
not
every
man
able
to
say
what
he
likes
i
ask
you
whether
the
world
over
or
in
past
history
there
is
anything
like
it
nothing
i
pray
that
our
unrivalled
happiness
may
last
this
is
the
old
story
of
our
system
of
checks
and
every
englishman
doing
as
he
likes
which
we
have
already
seen
to
have
been
convenient
enough
so
long
as
there
were
only
the
barbarians
and
the
philistines
to
do
what
they
liked
but
to
be
getting
inconvenient
and
productive
of
anarchy
now
that
the
populace
wants
to
do
what
it
likes
too
but
for
all
that
i
will
not
at
once
dismiss
this
famous
doctrine
but
will
first
quote
another
passage
from
the
times
applying
the
doctrine
to
a
matter
of
which
we
have
just
been
speaking
education
the
difficulty
here
in
providing
a
national
system
of
education
says
the
times
does
not
reside
in
any
removeable
arrangements
it
is
inherent
and
native
in
the
actual
and
inveterate
state
of
things
in
this
country
all
these
powers
and
personages
all
these
conflicting
influences
and
varieties
of
character
exist
and
have
long
existed
among
us
they
are
fighting
it
out
and
will
long
continue
to
fight
it
out
without
coming
to
that
happy
consummation
when
some
one
element
of
the
british
character
is
to
destroy
or
to
absorb
all
the
rest
there
it
is
the
various
promptings
of
the
natural
taste
for
the
bathos
in
this
man
and
that
amongst
us
are
fighting
it
out
and
the
day
will
never
come
and
indeed
why
should
we
wish
it
to
come
when
one
man
particular
sort
of
taste
for
the
bathos
shall
tyrannise
over
another
man
nor
when
right
reason
if
that
may
be
called
an
element
of
the
british
character
shall
absorb
and
rule
them
all
the
whole
system
of
this
country
like
the
constitution
we
boast
to
inherit
and
are
glad
to
uphold
is
made
up
of
established
facts
prescriptive
authorities
existing
usages
powers
that
be
persons
in
possession
and
communities
or
classes
that
have
won
dominion
for
themselves
and
will
hold
it
against
all
comers
every
force
in
the
world
evidently
except
the
one
reconciling
force
right
reason
sir
thomas
bateson
here
the
rev
cattle
on
this
side
bradlaugh
on
that
pull
devil
pull
baker
really
presented
with
the
mastery
of
style
of
our
leading
journal
the
sad
picture
as
one
gazes
upon
it
assumes
the
iron
and
inexorable
solemnity
of
tragic
destiny
after
this
the
milder
doctrine
of
our
other
philosophical
teacher
the
daily
news
has
at
first
something
very
attractive
and
assuaging
the
daily
news
begins
indeed
in
appearance
to
weave
the
iron
web
of
necessity
round
us
like
the
times
the
alternative
is
between
a
man
doing
what
he
likes
and
his
doing
what
some
one
else
probably
not
one
whit
wiser
than
himself
likes
this
points
to
the
tacit
compact
mentioned
in
my
last
paper
between
the
barbarians
and
the
philistines
and
into
which
it
is
hoped
that
the
populace
will
one
day
enter
the
compact
so
creditable
to
english
honesty
that
no
class
if
it
exercise
power
having
only
the
ideas
and
aims
of
its
ordinary
self
to
give
effect
to
shall
treat
its
ordinary
self
too
seriously
or
attempt
to
impose
it
on
others
but
shall
let
these
others
the
rev
cattle
for
instance
in
his
and
bradlaugh
in
his
hyde
park
mongering
have
their
fling
but
then
the
daily
news
suddenly
lights
up
the
gloom
of
necessitarianism
with
bright
beams
of
hope
no
doubt
it
says
the
common
reason
of
society
ought
to
check
the
aberrations
of
individual
eccentricity
this
common
reason
of
society
looks
very
like
our
best
self
or
right
reason
to
which
we
want
to
give
authority
by
making
the
action
of
the
state
or
nation
in
its
collective
character
the
expression
of
it
but
of
this
project
of
ours
the
daily
news
with
its
subtle
dialectics
makes
havoc
make
the
state
the
organ
of
the
common
reason
it
says
you
may
make
it
the
organ
of
something
or
other
but
how
can
you
be
certain
that
reason
will
be
the
quality
which
will
be
embodied
in
it
you
can
not
be
certain
of
it
undoubtedly
if
you
never
try
to
bring
the
thing
about
but
the
question
is
the
action
of
the
state
being
the
action
of
the
collective
nation
and
the
action
of
the
collective
nation
carrying
naturally
great
publicity
weight
and
force
of
example
with
it
whether
we
should
not
try
to
put
into
the
action
of
the
state
as
much
as
possible
of
right
reason
or
our
best
self
which
may
in
this
manner
come
back
to
us
with
new
force
and
authority
may
have
visibility
form
and
influence
and
help
to
confirm
us
in
the
many
moments
when
we
are
tempted
to
be
our
ordinary
selves
merely
in
resisting
our
natural
taste
of
the
bathos
rather
than
in
giving
way
to
it
but
no
says
our
teacher
it
is
better
there
should
be
an
infinite
variety
of
experiments
in
human
action
because
as
the
explorers
multiply
the
true
track
is
more
likely
to
be
discovered
the
common
reason
of
society
can
check
the
aberrations
of
individual
eccentricity
only
by
acting
on
the
individual
reason
and
it
will
do
so
in
the
main
sufficiently
if
left
to
this
natural
operation
this
is
what
i
call
the
specially
british
form
of
quietism
or
a
devout
but
excessive
reliance
on
an
providence
providence
as
the
moralists
are
careful
to
tell
us
generally
works
in
human
affairs
by
human
means
so
when
we
want
to
make
right
reason
act
on
individual
reason
our
best
self
on
our
ordinary
self
we
seek
to
give
it
more
power
of
doing
so
by
giving
it
public
recognition
and
authority
and
embodying
it
so
far
as
we
can
in
the
state
it
seems
too
much
to
ask
of
providence
that
while
we
on
our
part
leave
our
congenital
taste
for
the
bathos
to
its
natural
operation
and
its
infinite
variety
of
experiments
providence
should
mysteriously
guide
it
into
the
true
track
and
compel
it
to
relish
the
sublime
at
any
rate
great
men
and
great
institutions
have
hitherto
seemed
necessary
for
producing
any
considerable
effect
of
this
kind
no
doubt
we
have
an
infinite
variety
of
experiments
and
an
multitude
of
explorers
even
in
this
short
paper
i
have
enumerated
many
the
british
banner
judge
edmonds
newman
weeks
deborah
butler
elderess
polly
brother
noyes
the
rev
cattle
the
licensed
victuallers
the
commercial
travellers
and
i
know
not
how
many
more
and
the
numbers
of
this
noble
army
are
swelling
every
day
but
what
a
depth
of
quietism
or
rather
what
an
call
on
the
direct
interposition
of
providence
to
believe
that
these
interesting
explorers
will
discover
the
true
track
or
at
any
rate
will
do
so
in
the
main
sufficiently
whatever
that
may
mean
if
left
to
their
natural
operation
that
is
by
going
on
as
they
are
philosophers
say
indeed
that
we
learn
virtue
by
performing
acts
of
virtue
but
to
say
that
we
shall
learn
virtue
by
performing
any
acts
to
which
our
natural
taste
for
the
bathos
carries
us
that
the
rev
cattle
comes
at
his
best
self
by
or
newman
weeks
and
deborah
butler
at
right
reason
by
following
their
noses
this
certainly
does
appear
it
is
true
what
we
want
is
to
make
right
reason
act
on
individual
reason
the
reason
of
individuals
all
our
search
for
authority
has
that
for
its
end
and
aim
the
daily
news
says
i
observe
that
all
my
argument
for
authority
has
a
root
and
from
what
i
know
of
my
own
mind
and
its
inertness
i
think
this
so
probable
that
i
should
be
inclined
easily
to
admit
it
if
it
were
not
that
in
the
first
place
nothing
of
this
kind
perhaps
should
be
admitted
without
examination
and
in
the
second
a
way
of
accounting
for
this
charge
being
made
in
this
particular
instance
without
full
grounds
appears
to
present
itself
what
seems
to
me
to
account
here
perhaps
for
the
charge
is
the
want
of
flexibility
of
our
race
on
which
i
have
so
often
remarked
i
mean
it
being
admitted
that
the
conformity
of
the
individual
reason
of
the
rev
cattle
or
bradlaugh
with
right
reason
is
our
true
object
and
not
the
mere
restraining
them
by
the
strong
arm
of
the
state
from
or
admitting
this
we
have
so
little
flexibility
that
we
can
not
readily
perceive
that
the
restraining
them
from
these
indulgences
may
yet
fix
clearly
in
their
minds
that
to
the
collective
nation
these
indulgences
appear
irrational
and
unallowable
may
make
them
pause
and
reflect
and
may
contribute
to
bringing
with
time
their
individual
reason
into
harmony
with
right
reason
but
in
no
country
owing
to
the
want
of
intellectual
flexibility
above
mentioned
is
the
leaning
which
is
our
natural
one
and
therefore
needs
no
recommending
to
us
so
sedulously
recommended
and
the
leaning
which
is
not
our
natural
one
and
therefore
does
dispraising
to
us
so
sedulously
dispraised
as
in
ours
to
rely
on
the
individual
being
with
us
the
natural
leaning
we
will
hear
of
nothing
but
the
good
of
relying
on
the
individual
to
act
through
the
collective
nation
on
the
individual
being
not
our
natural
leaning
we
will
hear
nothing
in
recommendation
of
it
but
the
wise
know
that
we
often
need
to
hear
most
of
that
to
which
we
are
least
inclined
and
even
to
learn
to
employ
in
certain
circumstances
that
which
is
capable
if
employed
amiss
of
being
a
danger
to
us
elsewhere
this
is
certainly
better
understood
than
here
in
a
recent
number
of
the
westminster
review
an
able
writer
but
with
precisely
our
national
want
of
flexibility
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
has
unearthed
i
see
for
our
present
needs
an
english
translation
published
some
years
ago
of
wilhelm
von
humboldt
book
the
sphere
and
duties
of
government
humboldt
object
in
this
book
is
to
show
that
the
operation
of
government
ought
to
be
severely
limited
to
what
directly
and
immediately
relates
to
the
security
of
person
and
property
wilhelm
von
humboldt
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
perfect
souls
that
have
ever
existed
used
to
say
that
one
business
in
life
was
first
to
perfect
oneself
by
all
the
means
in
power
and
secondly
to
try
and
create
in
the
world
around
one
an
aristocracy
the
most
numerous
that
one
possibly
could
of
talents
and
characters
he
saw
of
course
that
in
the
end
everything
comes
to
this
that
the
individual
must
act
for
himself
and
must
be
perfect
in
himself
and
he
lived
in
a
country
germany
where
people
were
disposed
to
act
too
little
for
themselves
and
to
rely
too
much
on
the
government
but
even
thus
such
was
his
flexibility
so
little
was
he
in
bondage
to
a
mere
abstract
maxim
that
he
saw
very
well
that
for
his
purpose
itself
of
enabling
the
individual
to
stand
perfect
on
his
own
foundations
and
to
do
without
the
state
the
action
of
the
state
would
for
long
long
years
be
necessary
and
soon
after
he
wrote
his
book
on
the
sphere
and
duties
of
government
wilhelm
von
humboldt
became
minister
of
education
in
prussia
and
from
his
ministry
all
the
great
reforms
which
give
the
control
of
prussian
education
to
the
state
the
transference
of
the
management
of
public
schools
from
their
old
boards
of
trustees
to
the
state
the
obligatory
for
schools
the
obligatory
for
schoolmasters
and
the
foundation
of
the
great
state
university
of
berlin
take
their
origin
this
his
english
reviewer
says
not
a
word
of
but
writing
for
a
people
whose
dangers
lie
as
we
have
seen
on
the
side
of
their
unchecked
and
unguided
individual
action
whose
dangers
none
of
them
lie
on
the
side
of
an
on
the
state
he
quotes
just
so
much
of
wilhelm
von
humboldt
example
as
can
flatter
them
in
their
propensities
and
do
them
no
good
and
just
what
might
make
them
think
and
be
of
use
to
them
he
leaves
on
one
side
this
precisely
recalls
the
manner
it
will
be
observed
in
which
we
have
seen
that
our
royal
and
noble
personages
proceed
with
the
licensed
victuallers
in
france
the
action
of
the
state
on
individuals
is
yet
more
preponderant
than
in
germany
and
the
need
which
friends
of
human
perfection
feel
to
enable
the
individual
to
stand
perfect
on
his
own
foundations
is
all
the
stronger
but
what
says
one
of
the
staunchest
of
these
friends
monsieur
renan
on
state
action
and
even
state
action
in
that
very
sphere
where
in
france
it
is
most
excessive
the
sphere
of
education
here
are
his
words
a
liberal
believes
in
liberty
and
liberty
signifies
the
of
the
state
but
such
an
ideal
is
still
a
long
way
off
from
us
and
the
very
means
to
remove
it
to
an
indefinite
distance
would
be
precisely
the
withdrawing
its
action
too
soon
and
this
he
adds
is
even
truer
of
education
than
of
any
other
department
of
public
affairs
we
see
then
how
indispensable
to
that
human
perfection
which
we
seek
is
in
the
opinion
of
good
judges
some
public
recognition
and
establishment
of
our
best
self
or
right
reason
we
see
how
our
habits
and
practice
oppose
themselves
to
such
a
recognition
and
the
many
inconveniences
which
we
therefore
suffer
but
now
let
us
try
to
go
a
little
deeper
and
to
find
beneath
our
actual
habits
and
practice
the
very
ground
and
cause
out
of
which
they
spring
notes
he
that
trusteth
in
his
own
heart
is
a
fool
but
whoso
walketh
wisely
he
shall
be
delivered
the
king
james
bible
qui
trompe
ici
editor
translation
who
is
the
one
getting
fooled
here
chapter
iv
this
fundamental
ground
is
our
preference
of
doing
to
thinking
now
this
preference
is
a
main
element
in
our
nature
and
as
we
study
it
we
find
ourselves
opening
up
a
number
of
large
questions
on
every
side
let
me
go
back
for
a
moment
to
what
i
have
already
quoted
from
bishop
wilson
first
never
go
against
the
best
light
you
have
secondly
take
care
that
your
light
be
not
darkness
i
said
we
show
as
a
nation
laudable
energy
and
persistence
in
walking
according
to
the
best
light
we
have
but
are
not
quite
careful
enough
perhaps
to
see
that
our
light
be
not
darkness
this
is
only
another
version
of
the
old
story
that
energy
is
our
strong
point
and
favourable
characteristic
rather
than
intelligence
but
we
may
give
to
this
idea
a
more
general
form
still
in
which
it
will
have
a
yet
larger
range
of
application
we
may
regard
this
energy
driving
at
practice
this
paramount
sense
of
the
obligation
of
duty
and
work
this
earnestness
in
going
manfully
with
the
best
light
we
have
as
one
force
and
we
may
regard
the
intelligence
driving
at
those
ideas
which
are
after
all
the
basis
of
right
practice
the
ardent
sense
for
all
the
new
and
changing
combinations
of
them
which
man
development
brings
with
it
the
indomitable
impulse
to
know
and
adjust
them
perfectly
as
another
force
and
these
two
forces
we
may
regard
as
in
some
sense
rivals
rivals
not
by
the
necessity
of
their
own
nature
but
as
exhibited
in
man
and
his
history
and
rivals
dividing
the
empire
of
the
world
between
them
and
to
give
these
forces
names
from
the
two
races
of
men
who
have
supplied
the
most
signal
and
splendid
manifestations
of
them
we
may
call
them
respectively
the
forces
of
hebraism
and
hellenism
hebraism
and
hellenism
between
these
two
points
of
influence
moves
our
world
at
one
time
it
feels
more
powerfully
the
attraction
of
one
of
them
at
another
time
of
the
other
and
it
ought
to
be
though
it
never
is
evenly
and
happily
balanced
between
them
the
final
aim
of
both
hellenism
and
hebraism
as
of
all
great
spiritual
disciplines
is
no
doubt
the
same
man
perfection
or
salvation
the
very
language
which
they
both
of
them
use
in
schooling
us
to
reach
this
aim
is
often
identical
even
when
their
language
indicates
by
variation
sometimes
a
broad
variation
often
a
but
slight
and
subtle
variation
the
different
courses
of
thought
which
are
uppermost
in
each
discipline
even
then
the
unity
of
the
final
end
and
aim
is
still
apparent
to
employ
the
actual
words
of
that
discipline
with
which
we
ourselves
are
all
of
us
most
familiar
and
the
words
of
which
therefore
come
most
home
to
us
that
final
end
and
aim
is
that
we
might
be
partakers
of
the
divine
nature
these
are
the
words
of
a
hebrew
apostle
but
of
hellenism
and
hebraism
alike
this
is
i
say
the
aim
when
the
two
are
confronted
as
they
very
often
are
confronted
it
is
nearly
always
with
what
i
may
call
a
rhetorical
purpose
the
speaker
whole
design
is
to
exalt
and
enthrone
one
of
the
two
and
he
uses
the
other
only
as
a
foil
and
to
enable
him
the
better
to
give
effect
to
his
purpose
obviously
with
us
it
is
usually
hellenism
which
is
thus
reduced
to
minister
to
the
triumph
of
hebraism
there
is
a
sermon
on
greece
and
the
greek
spirit
by
a
man
never
to
be
mentioned
without
interest
and
respect
frederick
robertson
in
which
this
rhetorical
use
of
greece
and
the
greek
spirit
and
the
inadequate
exhibition
of
them
necessarily
consequent
upon
this
is
almost
ludicrous
and
would
be
censurable
if
it
were
not
to
be
explained
by
the
exigences
of
a
sermon
on
the
other
hand
heinrich
heine
and
other
writers
of
his
sort
give
us
the
spectacle
of
the
tables
completely
turned
and
of
hebraism
brought
in
just
as
a
foil
and
contrast
to
hellenism
and
to
make
the
superiority
of
hellenism
more
manifest
in
both
these
cases
there
is
injustice
and
misrepresentation
the
aim
and
end
of
both
hebraism
and
hellenism
is
as
i
have
said
one
and
the
same
and
this
aim
and
end
is
august
and
admirable
still
they
pursue
this
aim
by
very
different
courses
the
uppermost
idea
with
hellenism
is
to
see
things
as
they
really
are
the
uppermost
idea
with
hebraism
is
conduct
and
obedience
nothing
can
do
away
with
this
ineffaceable
difference
the
greek
quarrel
with
the
body
and
its
desires
is
that
they
hinder
right
thinking
the
hebrew
quarrel
with
them
is
that
they
hinder
right
acting
he
that
keepeth
the
law
happy
is
he
there
is
nothing
sweeter
than
to
take
heed
unto
the
commandments
of
the
lord
that
is
the
hebrew
notion
of
felicity
and
pursued
with
passion
and
tenacity
this
notion
would
not
let
the
hebrew
rest
till
as
is
well
known
he
had
at
last
got
out
of
the
law
a
network
of
prescriptions
to
enwrap
his
whole
life
to
govern
every
moment
of
it
every
impulse
every
action
the
greek
notion
of
felicity
on
the
other
hand
is
perfectly
conveyed
in
these
words
of
a
great
french
moralist
le
bonheur
des
hommes
when
when
they
abhor
that
which
is
evil
no
when
they
exercise
themselves
in
the
law
of
the
lord
day
and
night
no
when
they
die
daily
no
when
they
walk
about
the
new
jerusalem
with
palms
in
their
hands
no
but
when
they
think
aright
when
their
thought
hits
quand
ils
pensent
juste
at
the
bottom
of
both
the
greek
and
the
hebrew
notion
is
the
desire
native
in
man
for
reason
and
the
will
of
god
the
feeling
after
the
universal
order
in
a
word
the
love
of
god
but
while
hebraism
seizes
upon
certain
plain
capital
intimations
of
the
universal
order
and
rivets
itself
one
may
say
with
unequalled
grandeur
of
earnestness
and
intensity
on
the
study
and
observance
of
them
the
bent
of
hellenism
is
to
follow
with
flexible
activity
the
whole
play
of
the
universal
order
to
be
apprehensive
of
missing
any
part
of
it
of
sacrificing
one
part
to
another
to
slip
away
from
resting
in
this
or
that
intimation
of
it
however
capital
an
unclouded
clearness
of
mind
an
unimpeded
play
of
thought
is
what
this
bent
drives
at
the
governing
idea
of
hellenism
is
spontaneity
of
consciousness
that
of
hebraism
strictness
of
conscience
christianity
changed
nothing
in
this
essential
bent
of
hebraism
to
set
doing
above
knowing
the
following
not
our
own
individual
will
but
the
will
of
god
obedience
is
the
fundamental
idea
of
this
form
also
of
the
discipline
to
which
we
have
attached
the
general
name
of
hebraism
only
as
the
old
law
and
the
network
of
prescriptions
with
which
it
enveloped
human
life
were
evidently
a
motive
power
not
driving
and
searching
enough
to
produce
the
result
aimed
at
patient
continuance
in
well
doing
conquest
christianity
substituted
for
them
boundless
devotion
to
that
inspiring
and
affecting
pattern
of
offered
by
christ
and
by
the
new
motive
power
of
which
the
essence
was
this
though
the
love
and
admiration
of
christian
churches
have
for
centuries
been
employed
in
varying
amplifying
and
adorning
the
plain
description
of
it
christianity
as
paul
truly
says
establishes
the
law
and
in
the
strength
of
the
ampler
power
which
she
has
thus
supplied
to
fulfil
it
has
accomplished
the
miracles
which
we
all
see
of
her
history
so
long
as
we
do
not
forget
that
both
hellenism
and
hebraism
are
profound
and
admirable
manifestations
of
man
life
tendencies
and
powers
and
that
both
of
them
aim
at
a
like
final
result
we
can
hardly
insist
too
strongly
on
the
divergence
of
line
and
of
operation
with
which
they
proceed
it
is
a
divergence
so
great
that
it
most
truly
as
the
prophet
zechariah
says
has
raised
up
thy
sons
o
zion
against
thy
sons
o
greece
the
difference
whether
it
is
by
doing
or
by
knowing
that
we
set
most
store
and
the
practical
consequences
which
follow
from
this
difference
leave
their
mark
on
all
the
history
of
our
race
and
of
its
development
language
may
be
abundantly
quoted
from
both
hellenism
and
hebraism
to
make
it
seem
that
one
follows
the
same
current
as
the
other
towards
the
same
goal
they
are
truly
borne
towards
the
same
goal
but
the
currents
which
bear
them
are
infinitely
different
it
is
true
solomon
will
praise
knowing
understanding
is
a
of
life
unto
him
that
hath
it
and
in
the
new
testament
again
christ
is
a
light
and
truth
makes
us
free
it
is
true
aristotle
will
undervalue
knowing
in
what
concerns
virtue
says
he
three
things
are
necessary
knowledge
deliberate
will
and
perseverance
but
whereas
the
two
last
are
all
important
the
first
is
a
matter
of
little
importance
it
is
true
that
with
the
same
impatience
with
which
james
enjoins
a
man
to
be
not
a
forgetful
hearer
but
a
doer
of
the
work
epictetus
exhorts
us
to
do
what
we
have
demonstrated
to
ourselves
we
ought
to
do
or
he
taunts
us
with
futility
for
being
armed
at
all
points
to
prove
that
lying
is
wrong
yet
all
the
time
continuing
to
lie
it
is
true
plato
in
words
which
are
almost
the
words
of
the
new
testament
or
the
imitation
calls
life
a
learning
to
die
but
underneath
the
superficial
agreement
the
fundamental
divergence
still
subsists
the
understanding
of
solomon
is
the
walking
in
the
way
of
the
commandments
this
is
the
way
of
peace
and
it
is
of
this
that
blessedness
comes
in
the
new
testament
the
truth
which
gives
us
the
peace
of
god
and
makes
us
free
is
the
love
of
christ
constraining
us
to
crucify
as
he
did
and
with
a
like
purpose
of
moral
regeneration
the
flesh
with
its
affections
and
lusts
and
thus
establishing
as
we
have
seen
the
law
to
paul
it
appears
possible
to
hold
the
truth
in
unrighteousness
which
is
just
what
socrates
judged
impossible
the
moral
virtues
on
the
other
hand
are
with
aristotle
but
the
porch
and
access
to
the
intellectual
and
with
these
last
is
blessedness
that
partaking
of
the
divine
life
which
both
hellenism
and
hebraism
as
we
have
said
fix
as
their
crowning
aim
plato
expressly
denies
to
the
man
of
practical
virtue
merely
of
with
any
other
motive
than
that
of
perfect
intellectual
vision
he
reserves
it
for
the
lover
of
pure
knowledge
of
seeing
things
as
they
really
are
the
both
hellenism
and
hebraism
arise
out
of
the
wants
of
human
nature
and
address
themselves
to
satisfying
those
wants
but
their
methods
are
so
different
they
lay
stress
on
such
different
points
and
call
into
being
by
their
respective
disciplines
such
different
activities
that
the
face
which
human
nature
presents
when
it
passes
from
the
hands
of
one
of
them
to
those
of
the
other
is
no
longer
the
same
to
get
rid
of
one
ignorance
to
see
things
as
they
are
and
by
seeing
them
as
they
are
to
see
them
in
their
beauty
is
the
simple
and
attractive
ideal
which
hellenism
holds
out
before
human
nature
and
from
the
simplicity
and
charm
of
this
ideal
hellenism
and
human
life
in
the
hands
of
hellenism
is
invested
with
a
kind
of
aërial
ease
clearness
and
radiancy
they
are
full
of
what
we
call
sweetness
and
light
difficulties
are
kept
out
of
view
and
the
beauty
and
rationalness
of
the
ideal
have
all
our
thoughts
the
best
man
is
he
who
most
tries
to
perfect
himself
and
the
happiest
man
is
he
who
most
feels
that
he
is
perfecting
himself
this
account
of
the
matter
by
socrates
the
true
socrates
of
the
memorabilia
has
something
so
simple
spontaneous
and
unsophisticated
about
it
that
it
seems
to
fill
us
with
clearness
and
hope
when
we
hear
it
but
there
is
a
saying
which
i
have
heard
attributed
to
carlyle
about
socrates
a
very
happy
saying
whether
it
is
really
carlyle
or
not
which
excellently
marks
the
essential
point
in
which
hebraism
differs
from
hellenism
socrates
this
saying
goes
is
terribly
at
ease
in
zion
hebraism
and
here
is
the
source
of
its
wonderful
strength
has
always
been
severely
preoccupied
with
an
awful
sense
of
the
impossibility
of
being
at
ease
in
zion
of
the
difficulties
which
oppose
themselves
to
man
pursuit
or
attainment
of
that
perfection
of
which
socrates
talks
so
hopefully
and
as
from
this
point
of
view
one
might
almost
say
so
glibly
it
is
all
very
well
to
talk
of
getting
rid
of
one
ignorance
of
seeing
things
in
their
reality
seeing
them
in
their
beauty
but
how
is
this
to
be
done
when
there
is
something
which
thwarts
and
spoils
all
our
efforts
this
something
is
sin
and
the
space
which
sin
fills
in
hebraism
as
compared
with
hellenism
is
indeed
prodigious
this
obstacle
to
perfection
fills
the
whole
scene
and
perfection
appears
remote
and
rising
away
from
earth
in
the
background
under
the
name
of
sin
the
difficulties
of
knowing
oneself
and
conquering
oneself
which
impede
man
passage
to
perfection
become
for
hebraism
a
positive
active
entity
hostile
to
man
a
mysterious
power
which
i
heard
pusey
the
other
day
in
one
of
his
impressive
sermons
compare
to
a
hideous
hunchback
seated
on
our
shoulders
and
which
it
is
the
main
business
of
our
lives
to
hate
and
oppose
the
discipline
of
the
old
testament
may
be
summed
up
as
a
discipline
teaching
us
to
abhor
and
flee
from
sin
the
discipline
of
the
new
testament
as
a
discipline
teaching
us
to
die
to
it
as
hellenism
speaks
of
thinking
clearly
seeing
things
in
their
essence
and
beauty
as
a
grand
and
precious
feat
for
man
to
achieve
so
hebraism
speaks
of
becoming
conscious
of
sin
of
awakening
to
a
sense
of
sin
as
a
feat
of
this
kind
it
is
obvious
to
what
wide
divergence
these
differing
tendencies
actively
followed
must
lead
as
one
passes
and
repasses
from
hellenism
to
hebraism
from
plato
to
paul
one
feels
inclined
to
rub
eyes
and
ask
oneself
whether
man
is
indeed
a
gentle
and
simple
being
showing
the
traces
of
a
noble
and
divine
nature
or
an
unhappy
chained
captive
labouring
with
groanings
that
can
not
be
uttered
to
free
himself
from
the
body
of
this
death
apparently
it
was
the
hellenic
conception
of
human
nature
which
was
unsound
for
the
world
could
not
live
by
it
absolutely
to
call
it
unsound
however
is
to
fall
into
the
common
error
of
its
hebraising
enemies
but
it
was
unsound
at
that
particular
moment
of
development
it
was
premature
the
indispensable
basis
of
conduct
and
the
platform
upon
which
alone
the
perfection
aimed
at
by
greece
can
come
into
bloom
was
not
to
be
reached
by
our
race
so
easily
centuries
of
probation
and
discipline
were
needed
to
bring
us
to
it
therefore
the
bright
promise
of
hellenism
faded
and
hebraism
ruled
the
world
then
was
seen
that
astonishing
spectacle
so
well
marked
by
the
often
quoted
words
of
the
prophet
zechariah
when
men
of
all
languages
of
the
nations
took
hold
of
the
skirt
of
him
that
was
a
jew
saying
we
will
go
with
you
for
we
have
heard
that
god
is
with
you
and
the
hebraism
which
thus
received
and
ruled
a
world
all
gone
out
of
the
way
and
altogether
become
unprofitable
was
and
could
not
but
be
the
later
the
more
spiritual
the
more
attractive
development
of
hebraism
it
was
christianity
that
is
to
say
hebraism
aiming
at
and
rescue
from
the
thrall
of
vile
affections
not
by
obedience
to
the
letter
of
a
law
but
by
conformity
to
the
image
of
a
example
to
a
world
stricken
with
moral
enervation
christianity
offered
its
spectacle
of
an
inspired
to
men
who
refused
themselves
nothing
it
showed
one
who
refused
himself
everything
my
saviour
banished
joy
says
george
herbert
when
the
alma
venus
the
and
power
of
nature
so
fondly
cherished
by
the
pagan
world
could
not
save
her
followers
from
dissatisfaction
and
ennui
the
severe
words
of
the
apostle
came
bracingly
and
refreshingly
let
no
man
deceive
you
with
vain
words
for
because
of
these
things
cometh
the
wrath
of
god
upon
the
children
of
disobedience
throughout
age
after
age
and
generation
after
generation
our
race
or
all
that
part
of
our
race
which
was
most
living
and
progressive
was
baptized
into
a
death
and
endeavoured
by
suffering
in
the
flesh
to
cease
from
sin
of
this
endeavour
the
animating
labours
and
afflictions
of
early
christianity
the
touching
asceticism
of
mediaeval
christianity
are
the
great
historical
manifestations
literary
monuments
of
it
each
in
its
own
way
incomparable
remain
in
the
epistles
of
paul
in
confessions
and
in
the
two
original
and
simplest
books
of
the
imitation
of
two
disciplines
laying
their
main
stress
the
one
on
clear
intelligence
the
other
on
firm
obedience
the
one
on
comprehensively
knowing
the
grounds
of
one
duty
the
other
on
diligently
practising
it
the
one
on
taking
all
possible
care
to
use
bishop
wilson
words
again
that
the
light
we
have
be
not
darkness
the
other
that
according
to
the
best
light
we
have
we
diligently
walk
the
priority
naturally
belongs
to
that
discipline
which
braces
man
moral
powers
and
founds
for
him
an
indispensable
basis
of
character
and
therefore
it
is
justly
said
of
the
jewish
people
who
were
charged
with
setting
powerfully
forth
that
side
of
the
divine
order
to
which
the
words
conscience
and
point
that
they
were
entrusted
with
the
oracles
of
god
as
it
is
justly
said
of
christianity
which
followed
judaism
and
which
set
forth
this
side
with
a
much
deeper
effectiveness
and
a
much
wider
influence
that
the
wisdom
of
the
old
pagan
world
was
foolishness
compared
to
it
no
words
of
devotion
and
admiration
can
be
too
strong
to
render
thanks
to
these
beneficent
forces
which
have
so
borne
forward
humanity
in
its
appointed
work
of
coming
to
the
knowledge
and
possession
of
itself
above
all
in
those
great
moments
when
their
action
was
the
wholesomest
and
the
most
necessary
but
the
evolution
of
these
forces
separately
and
in
themselves
is
not
the
whole
evolution
of
humanity
their
single
history
is
not
the
whole
history
of
man
whereas
their
admirers
are
always
apt
to
make
it
stand
for
the
whole
history
hebraism
and
hellenism
are
neither
of
them
the
law
of
human
development
as
their
admirers
are
prone
to
make
them
they
are
each
of
them
contributions
to
human
development
august
contributions
invaluable
contributions
and
each
showing
itself
to
us
more
august
more
invaluable
more
preponderant
over
the
other
according
to
the
moment
in
which
we
take
them
and
the
relation
in
which
we
stand
to
them
the
nations
of
our
modern
world
children
of
that
immense
and
salutary
movement
which
broke
up
the
pagan
world
inevitably
stand
to
hellenism
in
a
relation
which
dwarfs
it
and
to
hebraism
in
a
relation
which
magnifies
it
they
are
inevitably
prone
to
take
hebraism
as
the
law
of
human
development
and
not
as
simply
a
contribution
to
it
however
precious
and
yet
the
lesson
must
perforce
be
learned
that
the
human
spirit
is
wider
than
the
most
priceless
of
the
forces
which
bear
it
onward
and
that
to
the
whole
development
of
man
hebraism
itself
is
like
hellenism
but
a
contribution
perhaps
we
may
help
ourselves
to
see
this
clearer
by
an
illustration
drawn
from
the
treatment
of
a
single
great
idea
which
has
profoundly
engaged
the
human
spirit
and
has
given
it
eminent
opportunities
for
showing
its
nobleness
and
energy
it
surely
must
be
perceived
that
the
idea
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
as
this
idea
rises
in
its
generality
before
the
human
spirit
is
something
grander
truer
and
more
satisfying
than
it
is
in
the
particular
forms
by
which
paul
in
the
famous
fifteenth
chapter
of
the
epistle
to
the
corinthians
and
plato
in
the
phaedo
endeavour
to
develope
and
establish
it
surely
we
can
not
but
feel
that
the
argumentation
with
which
the
hebrew
apostle
goes
about
to
expound
this
great
idea
is
after
all
confused
and
inconclusive
and
that
the
reasoning
drawn
from
analogies
of
likeness
and
equality
which
is
employed
upon
it
by
the
greek
philosopher
is
and
sterile
above
and
beyond
the
inadequate
solutions
which
hebraism
and
hellenism
here
attempt
extends
the
immense
and
august
problem
itself
and
the
human
spirit
which
gave
birth
to
it
and
this
single
illustration
may
suggest
to
us
how
the
same
thing
happens
in
other
cases
also
but
meanwhile
by
alternations
of
hebraism
and
hellenism
of
intellectual
and
moral
impulses
of
the
effort
to
see
things
as
they
really
are
and
the
effort
to
win
peace
by
the
human
spirit
proceeds
and
each
of
these
two
forces
has
its
appointed
hours
of
culmination
and
seasons
of
rule
as
the
great
movement
of
christianity
was
a
triumph
of
hebraism
and
man
moral
impulses
so
the
great
movement
which
goes
by
the
name
of
the
was
an
uprising
and
of
man
intellectual
impulses
and
of
hellenism
we
in
england
the
devoted
children
of
protestantism
chiefly
know
the
renascence
by
its
subordinate
and
secondary
side
of
the
reformation
the
reformation
has
been
often
called
a
hebraising
revival
a
return
to
the
ardour
and
sincereness
of
primitive
christianity
no
one
however
can
study
the
development
of
protestantism
and
of
protestant
churches
without
feeling
that
into
the
reformation
too
hebraising
child
of
the
renascence
and
offspring
of
its
fervour
rather
than
its
intelligence
as
it
undoubtedly
was
the
subtle
hellenic
leaven
of
the
renascence
found
its
way
and
that
the
exact
respective
parts
in
the
reformation
of
hebraism
and
of
hellenism
are
not
easy
to
separate
but
what
we
may
with
truth
say
is
that
all
which
protestantism
was
to
itself
clearly
conscious
of
all
which
it
succeeded
in
clearly
setting
forth
in
words
had
the
characters
of
hebraism
rather
than
of
hellenism
the
reformation
was
strong
in
that
it
was
an
earnest
return
to
the
bible
and
to
doing
from
the
heart
the
will
of
god
as
there
written
it
was
weak
in
that
it
never
consciously
grasped
or
applied
the
central
idea
of
the
renascence
the
hellenic
idea
of
pursuing
in
all
lines
of
activity
the
law
and
science
to
use
plato
words
of
things
as
they
really
are
whatever
direct
superiority
therefore
protestantism
had
over
catholicism
was
a
moral
superiority
a
superiority
arising
out
of
its
greater
sincerity
and
earnestness
at
the
moment
of
its
apparition
at
any
rate
in
dealing
with
the
heart
and
conscience
its
pretensions
to
an
intellectual
superiority
are
in
general
quite
illusory
for
hellenism
for
the
thinking
side
in
man
as
distinguished
from
the
acting
side
the
attitude
of
mind
of
protestantism
towards
the
bible
in
no
respect
differs
from
the
attitude
of
mind
of
catholicism
towards
the
church
the
mental
habit
of
him
who
imagines
that
balaam
ass
spoke
in
no
respect
differs
from
the
mental
habit
of
him
who
imagines
that
a
madonna
of
wood
or
stone
winked
and
the
one
who
says
that
god
church
makes
him
believe
what
he
believes
and
the
other
who
says
that
god
word
makes
him
believe
what
he
believes
are
for
the
philosopher
perfectly
alike
in
not
really
and
truly
knowing
when
they
say
god
church
and
god
word
what
it
is
they
say
or
whereof
they
affirm
in
the
sixteenth
century
therefore
hellenism
the
world
and
again
stood
in
presence
of
hebraism
a
hebraism
renewed
and
purged
now
it
has
not
been
enough
observed
how
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
fate
befell
hellenism
in
some
respects
analogous
to
that
which
befell
it
at
the
commencement
of
our
era
the
renascence
that
great
of
hellenism
that
irresistible
return
of
humanity
to
nature
and
to
seeing
things
as
they
are
which
in
art
in
literature
and
in
physics
produced
such
splendid
fruits
had
like
the
anterior
hellenism
of
the
pagan
world
a
side
of
moral
weakness
and
of
relaxation
or
insensibility
of
the
moral
fibre
which
in
italy
showed
itself
with
the
most
startling
plainness
but
which
in
france
england
and
other
countries
was
very
apparent
too
again
this
loss
of
spiritual
balance
this
exclusive
preponderance
given
to
man
perceiving
and
knowing
side
this
unnatural
defect
of
his
feeling
and
acting
side
provoked
a
reaction
let
us
trace
that
reaction
where
it
most
nearly
concerns
us
science
has
now
made
visible
to
everybody
the
great
and
pregnant
elements
of
difference
which
lie
in
race
and
in
how
signal
a
manner
they
make
the
genius
and
history
of
an
people
vary
from
those
of
a
semitic
people
hellenism
is
of
growth
hebraism
is
of
semitic
growth
and
we
english
a
nation
of
european
stock
seem
to
belong
naturally
to
the
movement
of
hellenism
but
nothing
more
strongly
marks
the
essential
unity
of
man
than
the
affinities
we
can
perceive
in
this
point
or
that
between
members
of
one
family
of
peoples
and
members
of
another
and
no
affinity
of
this
kind
is
more
strongly
marked
than
that
likeness
in
the
strength
and
prominence
of
the
moral
fibre
which
notwithstanding
immense
elements
of
difference
knits
in
some
special
sort
the
genius
and
history
of
us
english
and
of
our
american
descendants
across
the
atlantic
to
the
genius
and
history
of
the
hebrew
people
puritanism
which
has
been
so
great
a
power
in
the
english
nation
and
in
the
strongest
part
of
the
english
nation
was
originally
the
reaction
in
the
seventeenth
century
of
the
conscience
and
moral
sense
of
our
race
against
the
moral
indifference
and
lax
rule
of
conduct
which
in
the
sixteenth
century
came
in
with
the
renascence
it
was
a
reaction
of
hebraism
against
hellenism
and
it
powerfully
manifested
itself
as
was
natural
in
a
people
with
much
of
what
we
call
a
hebraising
turn
with
a
signal
affinity
for
the
bent
which
was
the
of
hebrew
life
eminently
by
its
humour
by
the
power
it
shows
through
this
gift
of
imaginatively
acknowledging
the
multiform
aspects
of
the
problem
of
life
and
of
thus
getting
itself
unfixed
from
its
own
certainty
of
smiling
at
its
own
our
race
has
yet
and
a
great
part
of
its
strength
lies
here
in
matters
of
practical
life
and
moral
conduct
a
strong
share
of
the
assuredness
the
tenacity
the
intensity
of
the
hebrews
this
turn
manifested
itself
in
puritanism
and
has
had
a
great
part
in
shaping
our
history
for
the
last
two
hundred
years
undoubtedly
it
checked
and
changed
amongst
us
that
movement
of
the
renascence
which
we
see
producing
in
the
reign
of
elizabeth
such
wonderful
fruits
undoubtedly
it
stopped
the
prominent
rule
and
direct
development
of
that
order
of
ideas
which
we
call
by
the
name
of
hellenism
and
gave
the
first
rank
to
a
different
order
of
ideas
apparently
too
as
we
said
of
the
former
defeat
of
hellenism
if
hellenism
was
defeated
this
shows
that
hellenism
was
imperfect
and
that
its
ascendency
at
that
moment
would
not
have
been
for
the
world
good
yet
there
is
a
very
important
difference
between
the
defeat
inflicted
on
hellenism
by
christianity
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
and
the
check
given
to
the
renascence
by
puritanism
the
greatness
of
the
difference
is
well
measured
by
the
difference
in
force
beauty
significance
and
usefulness
between
primitive
christianity
and
protestantism
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
it
was
altogether
the
hour
of
hebraism
primitive
christianity
was
legitimately
and
truly
the
ascendent
force
in
the
world
at
that
time
and
the
way
of
progress
lay
through
its
full
development
another
hour
in
development
began
in
the
fifteenth
century
and
the
main
road
of
his
progress
then
lay
for
a
time
through
hellenism
puritanism
was
no
longer
the
central
current
of
the
world
progress
it
was
a
side
stream
crossing
the
central
current
and
checking
it
the
cross
and
the
check
may
have
been
necessary
and
salutary
but
that
does
not
do
away
with
the
essential
difference
between
the
main
stream
of
advance
and
a
cross
or
side
stream
for
more
than
two
hundred
years
the
main
stream
of
man
advance
has
moved
towards
knowing
himself

chapter
v
the
matter
here
opened
is
so
large
and
the
trains
of
thought
to
which
it
gives
rise
are
so
manifold
that
we
must
be
careful
to
limit
ourselves
scrupulously
to
what
has
a
direct
bearing
upon
our
actual
discussion
we
have
found
that
at
the
bottom
of
our
present
unsettled
state
so
full
of
the
seeds
of
trouble
lies
the
notion
of
its
being
the
prime
right
and
happiness
for
each
of
us
to
affirm
himself
and
his
ordinary
self
to
be
doing
and
to
be
doing
freely
and
as
he
likes
we
have
found
at
the
bottom
of
it
the
disbelief
in
right
reason
as
a
lawful
authority
it
was
easy
to
show
from
our
practice
and
current
history
that
this
is
so
but
it
was
impossible
to
show
why
it
is
so
without
taking
a
somewhat
wider
sweep
and
going
into
things
a
little
more
deeply
why
in
fact
should
good
energetic
sensible
people
like
the
bulk
of
our
countrymen
come
to
have
such
light
belief
in
right
reason
and
such
an
exaggerated
value
for
their
own
independent
doing
however
crude
the
answer
is
because
of
an
exclusive
and
excessive
development
in
them
without
due
allowance
for
time
place
and
circumstance
of
that
side
of
human
nature
and
that
group
of
human
forces
to
which
we
have
given
the
general
name
of
hebraism
because
they
have
thought
their
real
and
only
important
homage
was
owed
to
a
power
concerned
with
their
obedience
rather
than
with
their
intelligence
a
power
interested
in
the
moral
side
of
their
nature
almost
exclusively
thus
they
have
been
led
to
regard
in
themselves
as
the
one
thing
needful
strictness
of
conscience
the
staunch
adherence
to
some
fixed
law
of
doing
we
have
got
already
instead
of
spontaneity
of
consciousness
which
tends
continually
to
enlarge
our
whole
law
of
doing
they
have
fancied
themselves
to
have
in
their
religion
a
sufficient
basis
for
the
whole
of
their
life
fixed
and
certain
for
ever
a
full
law
of
conduct
and
a
full
law
of
thought
so
far
as
thought
is
needed
as
well
whereas
what
they
really
have
is
a
law
of
conduct
a
law
of
unexampled
power
for
enabling
them
to
war
against
the
law
of
sin
in
their
members
and
not
to
serve
it
in
the
lusts
thereof
the
book
which
contains
this
invaluable
law
they
call
the
word
of
god
and
attribute
to
it
as
i
have
said
and
as
indeed
is
perfectly
well
known
a
reach
and
sufficiency
with
all
the
wants
of
human
nature
this
might
no
doubt
be
so
if
humanity
were
not
the
composite
thing
it
is
if
it
had
only
or
in
quite
overpowering
eminence
a
moral
side
and
the
group
of
instincts
and
powers
which
we
call
moral
but
it
has
besides
and
in
notable
eminence
an
intellectual
side
and
the
group
of
instincts
and
powers
which
we
call
intellectual
no
doubt
mankind
makes
in
general
its
progress
in
a
fashion
which
gives
at
one
time
full
swing
to
one
of
these
groups
of
instincts
at
another
time
to
the
other
and
faculties
are
so
intertwined
that
when
his
moral
side
and
the
current
of
force
which
we
call
hebraism
is
uppermost
this
side
will
manage
somehow
to
provide
or
appear
to
provide
satisfaction
for
his
intellectual
needs
and
when
his
intellectual
side
and
the
current
of
force
which
we
call
hellenism
is
uppermost
this
again
will
provide
or
appear
to
provide
satisfaction
for
men
moral
needs
but
sooner
or
later
it
becomes
manifest
that
when
the
two
sides
of
humanity
proceed
in
this
fashion
of
alternate
preponderance
and
not
of
mutual
understanding
and
balance
the
side
which
is
uppermost
does
not
really
provide
in
a
satisfactory
manner
for
the
needs
of
the
side
which
is
undermost
and
a
state
of
confusion
is
sooner
or
later
the
result
the
hellenic
half
of
our
nature
bearing
rule
makes
a
sort
of
provision
for
the
hebrew
half
but
it
turns
out
to
be
an
inadequate
provision
and
again
the
hebrew
half
of
our
nature
bearing
rule
makes
a
sort
of
provision
for
the
hellenic
half
but
this
too
turns
out
to
be
an
inadequate
provision
the
true
and
smooth
order
of
humanity
development
is
not
reached
in
either
way
and
therefore
while
we
willingly
admit
with
the
christian
apostle
that
the
world
by
wisdom
that
is
by
the
isolated
preponderance
of
its
intellectual
impulses
knew
not
god
or
the
true
order
of
things
it
is
yet
necessary
also
to
set
up
a
sort
of
converse
to
this
proposition
and
to
say
likewise
what
is
equally
true
that
the
world
by
puritanism
knew
not
god
and
it
is
on
this
converse
of
the
apostle
proposition
that
it
is
particularly
needful
to
insist
in
our
own
country
just
at
present
here
indeed
is
the
answer
to
many
criticisms
which
have
been
addressed
to
all
that
we
have
said
in
praise
of
sweetness
and
light
sweetness
and
light
evidently
have
to
do
with
the
bent
or
side
in
humanity
which
we
call
hellenic
greek
intelligence
has
obviously
for
its
essence
the
instinct
for
what
plato
calls
the
true
firm
intelligible
law
of
things
the
love
of
light
of
seeing
things
as
they
are
even
in
the
natural
sciences
where
the
greeks
had
not
time
and
means
adequately
to
apply
this
instinct
and
where
we
have
gone
a
great
deal
further
than
they
did
it
is
this
instinct
which
is
the
root
of
the
whole
matter
and
the
ground
of
all
our
success
and
this
instinct
the
world
has
mainly
learnt
of
the
greeks
inasmuch
as
they
are
humanity
most
signal
manifestation
of
it
greek
art
again
greek
beauty
have
their
root
in
the
same
impulse
to
see
things
as
they
really
are
inasmuch
as
greek
art
and
beauty
rest
on
fidelity
to
nature
the
best
nature
and
on
a
delicate
discrimination
of
what
this
best
nature
is
to
say
we
work
for
sweetness
and
light
then
is
only
another
way
of
saying
that
we
work
for
hellenism
but
oh
cry
many
people
sweetness
and
light
are
not
enough
you
must
put
strength
or
energy
along
with
them
and
make
a
kind
of
trinity
of
strength
sweetness
and
light
and
then
perhaps
you
may
do
some
good
that
is
to
say
we
are
to
join
hebraism
strictness
of
the
moral
conscience
and
manful
walking
by
the
best
light
we
have
together
with
hellenism
inculcate
both
and
rehearse
the
praises
of
both
or
rather
we
may
praise
both
in
conjunction
but
we
must
be
careful
to
praise
hebraism
most
culture
says
an
acute
though
somewhat
rigid
critic
sidgwick
diffuses
sweetness
and
light
i
do
not
undervalue
these
blessings
but
religion
gives
fire
and
strength
and
the
world
wants
fire
and
strength
even
more
than
sweetness
and
light
by
religion
let
me
explain
sidgwick
here
means
particularly
that
puritanism
on
the
insufficiency
of
which
i
have
been
commenting
and
to
which
he
says
i
am
unfair
now
no
doubt
it
is
possible
to
be
a
fanatical
partisan
of
light
and
the
instincts
which
push
us
to
it
a
fanatical
enemy
of
strictness
of
moral
conscience
and
the
instincts
which
push
us
to
it
a
fanaticism
of
this
sort
deforms
and
vulgarises
the
work
in
some
respects
so
remarkable
of
the
late
buckle
such
a
fanaticism
carries
its
own
mark
with
it
in
lacking
sweetness
and
its
own
penalty
in
that
lacking
sweetness
it
comes
in
the
end
to
lack
light
too
and
the
greeks
the
great
exponents
of
humanity
bent
for
sweetness
and
light
united
of
its
perception
that
the
truth
of
things
must
be
at
the
same
time
beauty
singularly
escaped
the
fanaticism
which
we
moderns
whether
we
hellenise
or
whether
we
hebraise
are
so
apt
to
show
and
arrived
though
failing
as
has
been
said
to
give
adequate
practical
satisfaction
to
the
claims
of
man
moral
side
at
the
idea
of
a
comprehensive
adjustment
of
the
claims
of
both
the
sides
in
man
the
moral
as
well
as
the
intellectual
of
a
full
estimate
of
both
and
of
a
reconciliation
of
both
an
idea
which
is
philosophically
of
the
greatest
value
and
the
best
of
lessons
for
us
moderns
so
we
ought
to
have
no
difficulty
in
conceding
to
sidgwick
that
manful
walking
by
the
best
light
one
has
fire
and
strength
as
he
calls
it
has
its
high
value
as
well
as
culture
the
endeavour
to
see
things
in
their
truth
and
beauty
the
pursuit
of
sweetness
and
light
but
whether
at
this
or
that
time
and
to
this
or
that
set
of
persons
one
ought
to
insist
most
on
the
praises
of
fire
and
strength
or
on
the
praises
of
sweetness
and
light
must
depend
one
would
think
on
the
circumstances
and
needs
of
that
particular
time
and
those
particular
persons
and
all
that
we
have
been
saying
and
indeed
any
glance
at
the
world
around
us
shows
that
with
us
with
the
most
respectable
and
strongest
part
of
us
the
ruling
force
is
now
and
long
has
been
a
puritan
force
the
care
for
fire
and
strength
strictness
of
conscience
hebraism
rather
than
the
care
for
sweetness
and
light
spontaneity
of
consciousness
hellenism
well
then
what
is
the
good
of
our
now
rehearsing
the
praises
of
fire
and
strength
to
ourselves
who
dwell
too
exclusively
on
them
already
when
sidgwick
says
so
broadly
that
the
world
wants
fire
and
strength
even
more
than
sweetness
and
light
is
he
not
carried
away
by
a
turn
for
powerful
generalisation
does
he
not
forget
that
the
world
is
not
all
of
one
piece
and
every
piece
with
the
same
needs
at
the
same
time
it
may
be
true
that
the
roman
world
at
the
beginning
of
our
era
or
leo
the
tenth
court
at
the
time
of
the
reformation
or
french
society
in
the
eighteenth
century
needed
fire
and
strength
even
more
than
sweetness
and
light
but
can
it
be
said
that
the
barbarians
who
overran
the
empire
needed
fire
and
strength
even
more
than
sweetness
and
light
or
that
the
puritans
needed
them
more
or
that
murphy
the
birmingham
lecturer
and
the
rev
cattle
and
his
friends
need
them
more
the
puritan
great
danger
is
that
he
imagines
himself
in
possession
of
a
rule
telling
him
the
unum
necessarium
or
one
thing
needful
and
that
he
then
remains
satisfied
with
a
very
crude
conception
of
what
this
rule
really
is
and
what
it
tells
him
thinks
he
has
now
knowledge
and
henceforth
needs
only
to
act
and
in
this
dangerous
state
of
assurance
and
proceeds
to
give
full
swing
to
a
number
of
the
instincts
of
his
ordinary
self
some
of
the
instincts
of
his
ordinary
self
he
has
by
the
help
of
his
rule
of
life
conquered
but
others
which
he
has
not
conquered
by
this
help
he
is
so
far
from
perceiving
to
need
subjugation
and
to
be
instincts
of
an
inferior
self
that
he
even
fancies
it
to
be
his
right
and
duty
in
virtue
of
having
conquered
a
limited
part
of
himself
to
give
unchecked
swing
to
the
remainder
he
is
i
say
a
victim
of
hebraism
of
the
tendency
to
cultivate
strictness
of
conscience
rather
than
spontaneity
of
consciousness
and
what
he
wants
is
a
larger
conception
of
human
nature
showing
him
the
number
of
other
points
at
which
his
nature
must
come
to
its
best
besides
the
points
which
he
himself
knows
and
thinks
of
there
is
no
unum
necessarium
or
one
thing
needful
which
can
free
human
nature
from
the
obligation
of
trying
to
come
to
its
best
at
all
these
points
the
real
unum
necessarium
for
us
is
to
come
to
our
best
at
all
points
instead
of
our
one
thing
needful
justifying
in
us
vulgarity
hideousness
ignorance
violence
our
vulgarity
hideousness
ignorance
violence
are
really
so
many
touchstones
which
try
our
one
thing
needful
and
which
prove
that
in
the
state
at
any
rate
in
which
we
ourselves
have
it
it
is
not
all
we
want
and
as
the
force
which
encourages
us
to
stand
staunch
and
fast
by
the
rule
and
ground
we
have
is
hebraism
so
the
force
which
encourages
us
to
go
back
upon
this
rule
and
to
try
the
very
ground
on
which
we
appear
to
stand
is
hellenism
a
turn
for
giving
our
consciousness
free
play
and
enlarging
its
range
and
what
i
say
is
not
that
hellenism
is
always
for
everybody
more
wanted
than
hebraism
but
that
for
the
rev
cattle
at
this
particular
moment
and
for
the
great
majority
of
us
his
it
is
more
wanted
nothing
is
more
striking
than
to
observe
in
how
many
ways
a
limited
conception
of
human
nature
the
notion
of
a
one
thing
needful
a
one
side
in
us
to
be
made
uppermost
the
disregard
of
a
full
and
harmonious
development
of
ourselves
tells
injuriously
on
our
thinking
and
acting
in
the
first
place
our
hold
upon
the
rule
or
standard
to
which
we
look
for
our
one
thing
needful
tends
to
become
less
and
less
near
and
vital
our
conception
of
it
more
and
more
mechanical
and
unlike
the
thing
itself
as
it
was
conceived
in
the
mind
where
it
originated
the
dealings
of
puritanism
with
the
writings
of
paul
afford
a
noteworthy
illustration
of
this
nowhere
so
much
as
in
the
writings
of
paul
and
in
that
great
apostle
greatest
work
the
epistle
to
the
romans
has
puritanism
found
what
seemed
to
furnish
it
with
the
one
thing
needful
and
to
give
it
canons
of
truth
absolute
and
final
now
all
writings
as
has
been
already
said
even
the
most
precious
writings
and
the
most
fruitful
must
inevitably
from
the
very
nature
of
things
be
but
contributions
to
human
thought
and
human
development
which
extend
wider
than
they
do
indeed
paul
in
the
very
epistle
of
which
we
are
speaking
shows
when
he
asks
who
hath
known
the
mind
of
the
lord
who
hath
known
that
is
the
true
and
divine
order
of
things
in
its
entirety
that
he
himself
acknowledges
this
fully
and
we
have
already
pointed
out
in
another
epistle
of
paul
a
great
and
vital
idea
of
the
human
spirit
the
idea
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
transcending
and
overlapping
so
to
speak
the
power
to
give
it
adequate
definition
and
expression
but
quite
distinct
from
the
question
whether
paul
expression
or
any
man
expression
can
be
a
perfect
and
final
expression
of
truth
comes
the
question
whether
we
rightly
seize
and
understand
his
expression
as
it
exists
now
perfectly
to
seize
another
meaning
as
it
stood
in
his
own
mind
is
not
easy
especially
when
the
man
is
separated
from
us
by
such
differences
of
race
training
time
and
circumstances
as
paul
but
there
are
degrees
of
nearness
in
getting
at
a
man
meaning
and
though
we
can
not
arrive
quite
at
what
paul
had
in
his
mind
yet
we
may
come
near
it
and
who
that
comes
thus
near
it
must
not
feel
how
terms
which
paul
employs
in
trying
to
follow
with
his
analysis
of
such
profound
power
and
originality
some
of
the
most
delicate
intricate
obscure
and
contradictory
workings
and
states
of
the
human
spirit
are
detached
and
employed
by
puritanism
not
in
the
connected
and
fluid
way
in
which
paul
employs
them
and
for
which
alone
words
are
really
meant
but
in
an
isolated
fixed
mechanical
way
as
if
they
were
talismans
and
how
all
trace
and
sense
of
paul
true
movement
of
ideas
and
sustained
masterly
analysis
is
thus
lost
who
i
say
that
has
watched
puritanism
the
force
which
so
strongly
hebraises
which
so
takes
paul
writings
as
something
absolute
and
final
containing
the
one
thing
needful
handle
such
terms
as
grace
faith
election
righteousness
but
must
feel
not
only
that
these
terms
have
for
the
mind
of
puritanism
a
sense
false
and
misleading
but
also
that
this
sense
is
the
most
monstrous
and
grotesque
caricature
of
the
sense
of
paul
and
that
his
true
meaning
is
by
these
worshippers
of
his
words
altogether
lost
or
to
take
another
eminent
example
in
which
not
puritanism
only
but
one
may
say
the
whole
religious
world
by
their
mechanical
use
of
paul
writings
can
be
shown
to
miss
or
change
his
real
meaning
the
whole
religious
world
one
may
say
use
now
the
word
resurrection
a
word
which
is
so
often
in
their
thoughts
and
on
their
lips
and
which
they
find
so
often
in
paul
writings
in
one
sense
only
they
use
it
to
mean
a
rising
again
after
the
physical
death
of
the
body
now
it
is
quite
true
that
paul
speaks
of
resurrection
in
this
sense
that
he
tries
to
describe
and
explain
it
and
that
he
condemns
those
who
doubt
and
deny
it
but
it
is
true
also
that
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
where
paul
thinks
and
speaks
of
resurrection
he
thinks
and
speaks
of
it
in
a
sense
different
from
this
in
the
sense
of
a
rising
to
a
new
life
before
the
physical
death
of
the
body
and
not
after
it
the
idea
on
which
we
have
already
touched
the
profound
idea
of
being
baptized
into
the
death
of
the
great
exemplar
of
and
annulment
of
repeating
in
our
own
person
by
virtue
of
identification
with
our
exemplar
his
course
of
and
and
of
thus
coming
within
the
limits
of
our
present
life
to
a
new
life
in
which
as
in
the
death
going
before
it
we
are
identified
with
our
exemplar
this
is
the
fruitful
and
original
conception
of
being
risen
with
christ
which
possesses
the
mind
of
paul
and
this
is
the
central
point
round
which
with
such
incomparable
emotion
and
eloquence
all
his
teaching
moves
for
him
the
life
after
our
physical
death
is
really
in
the
main
but
a
consequence
and
continuation
of
the
inexhaustible
energy
of
the
new
life
thus
originated
on
this
side
the
grave
this
grand
pauline
idea
of
christian
resurrection
is
worthily
rehearsed
in
one
of
the
noblest
collects
of
the
and
is
destined
no
doubt
to
fill
a
more
and
more
important
place
in
the
christianity
of
the
future
but
almost
as
signal
as
is
the
essentialness
of
this
characteristic
idea
in
paul
teaching
is
the
completeness
with
which
the
worshippers
of
paul
words
as
an
absolute
final
expression
of
saving
truth
have
lost
it
and
have
substituted
for
the
living
and
near
conception
of
a
resurrection
now
their
mechanical
and
remote
conception
of
a
resurrection
hereafter
in
short
so
fatal
is
the
notion
of
possessing
even
in
the
most
precious
words
or
standards
the
one
thing
needful
of
having
in
them
once
for
all
a
full
and
sufficient
measure
of
light
to
guide
us
and
of
there
being
no
duty
left
for
us
except
to
make
our
practice
square
exactly
with
them
so
fatal
i
say
is
this
notion
to
the
right
knowledge
and
comprehension
of
the
very
words
or
standards
we
thus
adopt
and
to
such
strange
distortions
and
perversions
of
them
does
it
inevitably
lead
that
whenever
we
hear
that
commonplace
which
hebraism
if
we
venture
to
inquire
what
a
man
knows
is
so
apt
to
bring
out
against
us
in
disparagement
of
what
we
call
culture
and
in
praise
of
a
man
sticking
to
the
one
thing
needful
he
knows
says
hebraism
his
bible
whenever
we
hear
this
said
we
may
without
any
elaborate
defence
of
culture
content
ourselves
with
answering
simply
no
man
who
knows
nothing
else
knows
even
his
bible
now
the
force
which
we
have
so
much
neglected
hellenism
may
be
liable
to
fail
in
moral
force
and
earnestness
but
by
the
law
of
its
nature
the
very
same
law
which
makes
it
sometimes
deficient
in
intensity
when
intensity
is
required
it
opposes
itself
to
the
notion
of
cutting
our
being
in
two
of
attributing
to
one
part
the
dignity
of
dealing
with
the
one
thing
needful
and
leaving
the
other
part
to
take
its
chance
which
is
the
bane
of
hebraism
essential
in
hellenism
is
the
impulse
to
the
development
of
the
whole
man
to
connecting
and
harmonising
all
parts
of
him
perfecting
all
leaving
none
to
take
their
chance
because
the
characteristic
bent
of
hellenism
as
has
been
said
is
to
find
the
intelligible
law
of
things
and
there
is
no
intelligible
law
of
things
things
can
not
really
appear
intelligible
unless
they
are
also
beautiful
the
body
is
not
intelligible
is
not
seen
in
its
true
nature
and
as
it
really
is
unless
it
is
seen
as
beautiful
behaviour
is
not
intelligible
does
not
account
for
itself
to
the
mind
and
show
the
reason
for
its
existing
unless
it
is
beautiful
the
same
with
discourse
the
same
with
song
the
same
with
worship
the
same
with
all
the
modes
in
which
man
proves
his
activity
and
expresses
himself
to
think
that
when
one
shows
what
is
mean
or
vulgar
or
hideous
one
can
be
permitted
to
plead
that
one
has
that
within
which
passes
show
to
suppose
that
the
possession
of
what
benefits
and
satisfies
one
part
of
our
being
can
make
allowable
either
discourse
like
and
the
rev
cattle
or
poetry
like
the
hymns
we
all
hear
or
places
of
worship
like
the
chapels
we
all
see
this
it
is
abhorrent
to
the
nature
of
hellenism
to
concede
and
to
be
like
our
honoured
and
justly
honoured
faraday
a
great
natural
philosopher
with
one
side
of
his
being
and
a
sandemanian
with
the
other
would
to
archimedes
have
been
impossible
it
is
evident
to
what
a
perfecting
of
man
powers
and
activities
this
demand
of
hellenism
for
satisfaction
to
be
given
to
the
mind
by
everything
which
we
do
is
calculated
to
impel
our
race
it
has
its
dangers
as
has
been
fully
granted
the
notion
of
this
sort
of
equipollency
in
man
modes
of
activity
may
lead
to
moral
relaxation
what
we
do
not
make
our
one
thing
needful
we
may
come
to
treat
not
enough
as
if
it
were
needful
though
it
is
indeed
very
needful
and
at
the
same
time
very
hard
still
what
side
in
us
has
not
its
dangers
and
which
of
our
impulses
can
be
a
talisman
to
give
us
perfection
outright
and
not
merely
a
help
to
bring
us
towards
it
has
not
hebraism
as
we
have
shown
its
dangers
as
well
as
hellenism
and
have
we
used
so
excessively
the
tendencies
in
ourselves
to
which
hellenism
makes
appeal
that
we
are
now
suffering
from
it
are
we
not
on
the
contrary
now
suffering
because
we
have
not
enough
used
these
tendencies
as
a
help
towards
perfection
for
we
see
whither
it
has
brought
us
the
long
exclusive
predominance
of
hebraism
the
insisting
on
perfection
in
one
part
of
our
nature
and
not
in
all
the
singling
out
the
moral
side
the
side
of
obedience
and
action
for
such
intent
regard
making
strictness
of
the
moral
conscience
so
far
the
principal
thing
and
putting
off
for
hereafter
and
for
another
world
the
care
for
being
complete
at
all
points
the
full
and
harmonious
development
of
our
humanity
instead
of
watching
and
following
on
its
ways
the
desire
which
as
plato
says
for
ever
through
all
the
universe
tends
towards
that
which
is
lovely
we
think
that
the
world
has
settled
its
accounts
with
this
desire
knows
what
this
desire
wants
of
it
and
that
all
the
impulses
of
our
ordinary
self
which
do
not
conflict
with
the
terms
of
this
settlement
in
our
narrow
view
of
it
we
may
follow
unrestrainedly
under
the
sanction
of
some
such
text
as
not
slothful
in
business
or
whatsoever
thy
hand
findeth
to
do
do
it
with
all
thy
might
or
something
else
of
the
same
kind
and
to
any
of
these
impulses
we
soon
come
to
give
that
same
character
of
a
mechanical
absolute
law
which
we
give
to
our
religion
we
regard
it
as
we
do
our
religion
as
an
object
for
strictness
of
conscience
not
for
spontaneity
of
consciousness
for
unremitting
adherence
on
its
own
account
not
for
going
back
upon
viewing
in
its
connection
with
other
things
and
adjusting
to
a
number
of
changing
circumstances
we
treat
it
in
short
just
as
we
treat
our
religion
as
machinery
it
is
in
this
way
that
the
barbarians
treat
their
bodily
exercises
the
philistines
their
business
spurgeon
his
voluntaryism
mr
bright
the
assertion
of
personal
liberty
beales
the
right
of
meeting
in
hyde
park
in
all
those
cases
what
is
needed
is
a
freer
play
of
consciousness
upon
the
object
of
pursuit
and
in
all
of
them
hebraism
the
valuing
staunchness
and
earnestness
more
than
this
free
play
the
entire
subordination
of
thinking
to
doing
has
led
to
a
mistaken
and
misleading
treatment
of
things
the
newspapers
a
short
time
ago
contained
an
account
of
the
suicide
of
a
smith
secretary
to
some
insurance
company
who
it
was
said
laboured
under
the
apprehension
that
he
would
come
to
poverty
and
that
he
was
eternally
lost
and
when
i
read
these
words
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
poor
man
who
came
to
such
a
mournful
end
was
in
truth
a
kind
of
type
by
the
selection
of
his
two
grand
objects
of
concern
by
their
isolation
from
everything
else
and
their
juxtaposition
to
one
another
of
all
the
strongest
most
respectable
and
most
representative
part
of
our
nation
he
laboured
under
the
apprehension
that
he
would
come
to
poverty
and
that
he
was
eternally
lost
the
whole
have
a
conception
of
things
a
conception
which
makes
us
call
them
philistines
just
like
that
of
this
poor
man
though
we
are
seldom
of
course
shocked
by
seeing
it
take
the
distressing
violently
morbid
and
fatal
turn
which
it
took
with
him
but
how
generally
with
how
many
of
us
are
the
main
concerns
of
life
limited
to
these
two
the
concern
for
making
money
and
the
concern
for
saving
our
souls
and
how
entirely
does
the
narrow
and
mechanical
conception
of
our
secular
business
proceed
from
a
narrow
and
mechanical
conception
of
our
religious
business
what
havoc
do
the
united
conceptions
make
of
our
lives
it
is
because
the
of
these
two
presents
to
us
the
one
thing
needful
in
so
fixed
narrow
and
mechanical
a
way
that
so
ignoble
a
fellow
to
it
as
the
becomes
possible
and
having
been
once
admitted
takes
the
same
rigid
and
absolute
character
as
the
other
poor
smith
had
sincerely
the
nobler
as
well
as
the
meaner
the
concern
for
saving
his
soul
according
to
the
narrow
and
mechanical
conception
which
puritanism
has
of
what
the
salvation
of
the
soul
is
and
the
concern
for
making
money
but
let
us
remark
how
many
people
there
are
especially
outside
the
limits
of
the
serious
and
conscientious
to
which
smith
belonged
who
take
up
with
a
meaner
whether
it
be
pleasure
or
or
bodily
exercises
or
business
or
popular
agitation
who
take
up
with
one
of
these
exclusively
and
neglect
smith
nobler
concern
because
of
the
mechanical
form
which
hebraism
has
given
to
this
nobler
making
it
stand
as
we
have
said
as
something
talismanic
isolated
and
justifying
our
giving
our
ordinary
selves
free
play
in
amusement
or
business
or
popular
agitation
if
we
have
made
our
accounts
square
with
this
and
if
we
have
not
rendering
other
things
indifferent
and
our
ordinary
self
all
we
have
to
follow
and
to
follow
with
all
the
energy
that
is
in
us
till
we
do
whereas
the
idea
of
perfection
at
all
points
the
encouraging
in
ourselves
spontaneity
of
consciousness
the
letting
a
free
play
of
thought
live
and
flow
around
all
our
activity
the
indisposition
to
allow
one
side
of
our
activity
to
stand
as
so
and
that
it
makes
other
sides
indifferent
this
bent
of
mind
in
us
may
not
only
check
us
in
following
unreservedly
a
mean
of
any
kind
but
may
even
also
bring
new
life
and
movement
into
that
side
of
us
with
which
alone
hebraism
concerns
itself
and
awaken
a
healthier
and
less
mechanical
activity
there
hellenism
may
thus
actually
serve
to
further
the
designs
of
hebraism
undoubtedly
it
thus
served
in
the
first
days
of
christianity
christianity
as
has
been
said
occupied
itself
like
hebraism
with
the
moral
side
of
man
exclusively
with
his
moral
affections
and
moral
conduct
and
so
far
it
was
but
a
continuation
of
hebraism
but
it
transformed
and
renewed
hebraism
by
going
back
upon
a
fixed
rule
which
had
become
mechanical
and
had
thus
lost
its
vital
power
by
letting
the
thought
play
freely
around
this
old
rule
and
perceive
its
inadequacy
by
developing
a
new
which
men
moral
consciousness
could
take
living
hold
of
and
could
move
in
sympathy
with
what
was
this
but
an
importation
of
hellenism
as
we
have
defined
it
into
hebraism
and
as
paul
used
the
contradiction
between
the
jew
profession
and
practice
his
shortcomings
on
that
very
side
of
moral
affection
and
moral
conduct
which
the
jew
and
paul
both
of
them
regarded
as
all
in
all
thou
that
sayest
a
man
should
not
steal
dost
thou
steal
thou
that
sayest
a
man
should
not
commit
adultery
dost
thou
commit
adultery
for
a
proof
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
old
rule
of
life
in
the
jew
mechanical
conception
of
it
and
tried
to
rescue
him
by
making
his
consciousness
play
freely
around
this
rule
that
is
by
a
so
far
hellenic
treatment
of
it
even
so
when
we
hear
so
much
said
of
the
growth
of
commercial
immorality
in
our
serious
class
of
the
melting
away
of
habits
of
strict
probity
before
the
temptation
to
get
quickly
rich
and
to
cut
a
figure
in
the
world
when
we
see
at
any
rate
so
much
confusion
of
thought
and
of
practice
in
this
great
representative
class
of
our
nation
may
we
not
be
disposed
to
say
that
this
confusion
shows
that
his
new
of
grace
and
imputed
righteousness
has
become
to
the
puritan
as
mechanical
and
with
as
ineffective
a
hold
upon
his
practice
as
the
old
power
of
the
law
was
to
the
jew
and
that
the
remedy
is
the
same
as
that
which
paul
employed
an
importation
of
what
we
have
called
hellenism
into
his
hebraism
a
making
his
consciousness
flow
freely
round
his
petrified
rule
of
life
and
renew
it
only
with
this
difference
that
whereas
paul
imported
hellenism
within
the
limits
of
our
moral
part
only
this
part
being
still
treated
by
him
as
all
in
all
and
whereas
he
exhausted
one
may
say
and
used
to
the
very
uttermost
the
possibilities
of
fruitfully
importing
it
on
that
side
exclusively
we
ought
to
try
and
import
it
guiding
ourselves
by
the
ideal
of
a
human
nature
harmoniously
perfect
at
all
points
into
all
the
lines
of
our
activity
and
only
by
so
doing
can
we
rightly
quicken
refresh
and
renew
those
very
instincts
now
so
much
baffled
to
which
hebraism
makes
appeal
but
if
we
will
not
be
warned
by
the
confusion
visible
enough
at
present
in
our
thinking
and
acting
that
we
are
in
a
false
line
in
having
developed
our
hebrew
side
so
exclusively
and
our
hellenic
side
so
feebly
and
at
random
in
loving
fixed
rules
of
action
so
much
more
than
the
intelligible
law
of
things
let
us
listen
to
a
remarkable
testimony
which
the
opinion
of
the
world
around
us
offers
all
the
world
now
sets
great
and
increasing
value
on
three
objects
which
have
long
been
very
dear
to
us
and
pursues
them
in
its
own
way
or
tries
to
pursue
them
these
three
objects
are
industrial
enterprise
bodily
exercises
and
freedom
certainly
we
have
before
and
beyond
our
neighbours
given
ourselves
to
these
three
things
with
ardent
passion
and
with
high
success
and
this
our
neighbours
can
not
but
acknowledge
and
they
must
needs
when
they
themselves
turn
to
these
things
have
an
eye
to
our
example
and
take
something
of
our
practice
now
generally
when
people
are
interested
in
an
object
of
pursuit
they
can
not
help
feeling
an
enthusiasm
for
those
who
have
already
laboured
successfully
at
it
and
for
their
success
not
only
do
they
study
them
they
also
love
and
admire
them
in
this
way
a
man
who
is
interested
in
the
art
of
war
not
only
acquaints
himself
with
the
performance
of
great
generals
but
he
has
an
admiration
and
enthusiasm
for
them
so
too
one
who
wants
to
be
a
painter
or
a
poet
can
not
help
loving
and
admiring
the
great
painters
or
poets
who
have
gone
before
him
and
shown
him
the
way
but
it
is
strange
with
how
little
of
love
admiration
or
enthusiasm
the
world
regards
us
and
our
freedom
our
bodily
exercises
and
our
industrial
prowess
much
as
these
things
themselves
are
beginning
to
interest
it
and
is
not
the
reason
because
we
follow
each
of
these
things
in
a
mechanical
manner
as
an
end
in
and
for
itself
and
not
in
reference
to
a
general
end
of
human
perfection
and
this
makes
our
pursuit
of
them
uninteresting
to
humanity
and
not
what
the
world
truly
wants
it
seems
to
them
mere
machinery
that
we
can
knowingly
teach
them
to
worship
a
mere
fetish
british
freedom
british
industry
british
muscularity
we
work
for
each
of
these
three
things
blindly
with
no
notion
of
giving
each
its
due
proportion
and
prominence
because
we
have
no
ideal
of
harmonious
human
perfection
before
our
minds
to
set
our
work
in
motion
and
to
guide
it
so
the
rest
of
the
world
desiring
industry
or
freedom
or
bodily
strength
yet
desiring
these
not
as
we
do
absolutely
but
as
means
to
something
else
imitate
indeed
of
our
practice
what
seems
useful
for
them
but
us
whose
practice
they
imitate
they
seem
to
entertain
neither
love
nor
admiration
for
let
us
observe
on
the
other
hand
the
love
and
enthusiasm
excited
by
others
who
have
laboured
for
these
very
things
perhaps
of
what
we
call
industrial
enterprise
it
is
not
easy
to
find
examples
in
former
times
but
let
us
consider
how
greek
freedom
and
greek
gymnastics
have
attracted
the
love
and
praise
of
mankind
who
give
so
little
love
and
praise
to
ours
and
what
can
be
the
reason
of
this
difference
surely
because
the
greeks
pursued
freedom
and
pursued
gymnastics
not
mechanically
but
with
constant
reference
to
some
ideal
of
complete
human
perfection
and
happiness
and
therefore
in
spite
of
faults
and
failures
they
interest
and
delight
by
their
pursuit
of
them
all
the
rest
of
mankind
who
instinctively
feel
that
only
as
things
are
pursued
with
reference
to
this
ideal
are
they
valuable
here
again
therefore
as
in
the
confusion
into
which
the
thought
and
action
of
even
the
steadiest
class
amongst
us
is
beginning
to
fall
we
seem
to
have
an
admonition
that
we
have
fostered
our
hebraising
instincts
our
preference
of
earnestness
of
doing
to
delicacy
and
flexibility
of
thinking
too
exclusively
and
have
been
landed
by
them
in
a
mechanical
and
unfruitful
routine
and
again
we
seem
taught
that
the
development
of
our
hellenising
instincts
seeking
skilfully
the
intelligible
law
of
things
and
making
a
stream
of
fresh
thought
play
freely
about
our
stock
notions
and
habits
is
what
is
most
wanted
by
us
at
present
well
then
from
all
sides
the
more
we
go
into
the
matter
the
currents
seem
to
converge
and
together
to
bear
us
along
towards
culture
if
we
look
at
the
world
outside
us
we
find
a
disquieting
absence
of
sure
authority
we
discover
that
only
in
right
reason
can
we
get
a
source
of
sure
authority
and
culture
brings
us
towards
right
reason
if
we
look
at
our
own
inner
world
we
find
all
manner
of
confusion
arising
out
of
the
habits
of
unintelligent
routine
and
growth
to
which
a
too
exclusive
worship
of
fire
strength
earnestness
and
action
has
brought
us
what
we
want
is
a
fuller
harmonious
development
of
our
humanity
a
free
play
of
thought
upon
our
routine
notions
spontaneity
of
consciousness
sweetness
and
light
and
these
are
just
what
culture
generates
and
fosters
proceeding
from
this
idea
of
the
harmonious
perfection
of
our
humanity
and
seeking
to
help
itself
up
towards
this
perfection
by
knowing
and
spreading
the
best
which
has
been
reached
in
the
world
an
object
not
to
be
gained
without
books
and
reading
culture
has
got
its
name
touched
in
the
fancies
of
men
with
a
sort
of
air
of
bookishness
and
pedantry
cast
upon
it
from
the
follies
of
the
many
bookmen
who
forget
the
end
in
the
means
and
use
their
books
with
no
real
aim
at
perfection
we
will
not
stickle
for
a
name
and
the
name
of
culture
one
might
easily
give
up
if
only
those
who
decry
the
frivolous
and
pedantic
sort
of
culture
but
wish
at
bottom
for
the
same
things
as
we
do
would
be
careful
on
their
part
not
in
disparaging
and
discrediting
the
false
culture
to
unwittingly
disparage
and
discredit
among
a
people
with
little
natural
reverence
for
it
the
true
also
but
what
we
are
concerned
for
is
the
thing
not
the
name
and
the
thing
call
it
by
what
name
we
will
is
simply
the
enabling
ourselves
whether
by
reading
observing
or
thinking
to
come
as
near
as
we
can
to
the
firm
intelligible
law
of
things
and
thus
to
get
a
basis
for
a
less
confused
action
and
a
more
complete
perfection
than
we
have
at
present
and
now
therefore
when
we
are
accused
of
preaching
up
a
spirit
of
cultivated
inaction
of
provoking
the
earnest
lovers
of
action
of
refusing
to
lend
a
hand
at
uprooting
certain
definite
evils
of
despairing
to
find
any
lasting
truth
to
minister
to
the
diseased
spirit
of
our
time
we
shall
not
be
so
much
confounded
and
embarrassed
what
to
answer
for
ourselves
we
shall
say
boldly
that
we
do
not
at
all
despair
of
finding
some
lasting
truth
to
minister
to
the
diseased
spirit
of
our
time
but
that
we
have
discovered
the
best
way
of
finding
this
to
be
not
so
much
by
lending
a
hand
to
our
friends
and
countrymen
in
their
actual
operations
for
the
removal
of
certain
definite
evils
but
rather
in
getting
our
friends
and
countrymen
to
seek
culture
to
let
their
consciousness
play
freely
round
their
present
operations
and
the
stock
notions
on
which
they
are
founded
show
what
these
are
like
and
how
related
to
the
intelligible
law
of
things
and
auxiliary
to
true
human
perfection

needful
arnold
refers
here
and
in
his
subsequent
chapter
title
porro
unum
est
necessarium
to
luke
here
is
the
context
jesus
entered
into
a
certain
village
and
a
certain
woman
named
martha
received
him
into
her
house
and
she
had
a
sister
called
mary
but
martha
was
cumbered
about
much
serving
and
came
to
him
and
said
lord
dost
thou
not
care
that
my
sister
hath
left
me
to
serve
alone
bid
her
therefore
that
she
help
me
and
jesus
answered
and
said
unto
her
martha
martha
thou
art
careful
and
troubled
about
many
things
but
one
thing
is
needful
and
mary
hath
chosen
that
good
part
which
shall
not
be
taken
away
from
her
king

who
hath
known

but
an
unpretending
writer
without
a
philosophy
based
on
subordinate
and
coherent
principles
must
not
presume
to
indulge
himself
too
much
in
generalities
but
he
must
keep
close
to
the
level
ground
of
common
fact
the
only
safe
ground
for
understandings
without
a
scientific
equipment
therefore
i
am
bound
to
take
before
concluding
some
of
the
practical
operations
in
which
my
friends
and
countrymen
are
at
this
moment
engaged
and
to
make
these
if
i
can
show
the
truth
of
what
i
have
advanced
probably
i
could
hardly
give
a
greater
proof
of
my
confessed
inexpertness
in
reasoning
and
arguing
than
by
taking
for
my
first
example
of
an
operation
of
this
kind
the
proceedings
for
the
disestablishment
of
the
irish
church
which
we
are
now
witnessing
it
seems
so
clear
that
this
is
surely
one
of
those
operations
for
the
uprooting
of
a
certain
definite
evil
in
which
one
liberal
friends
engage
and
have
a
right
to
complain
and
to
get
impatient
and
to
reproach
one
with
delicate
conservative
scepticism
and
cultivated
inaction
if
one
does
not
lend
a
hand
to
help
them
this
does
indeed
seem
evident
and
yet
this
operation
comes
so
prominently
before
us
just
at
this
moment
it
so
challenges
everybody
regard
one
seems
cowardly
in
blinking
it
so
let
us
venture
to
try
and
see
whether
this
conspicuous
operation
is
one
of
those
round
which
we
need
to
let
our
consciousness
play
freely
and
reveal
what
manner
of
spirit
we
are
of
in
doing
it
or
whether
it
is
one
which
by
no
means
admits
the
application
of
this
doctrine
of
ours
and
one
to
which
we
ought
to
lend
a
hand
immediately
now
it
seems
plain
that
the
present
church
establishment
in
ireland
is
contrary
to
reason
and
justice
in
so
far
as
the
church
of
a
very
small
minority
of
the
people
there
takes
for
itself
all
the
church
property
of
the
irish
people
and
one
would
think
that
property
assigned
for
the
purpose
of
providing
for
a
religious
worship
when
that
worship
was
one
the
state
should
when
that
worship
is
split
into
several
forms
apportion
between
those
several
forms
with
due
regard
to
circumstances
taking
account
only
of
great
differences
which
are
likely
to
be
lasting
and
of
considerable
communions
which
are
likely
to
represent
profound
and
widespread
religious
characteristics
and
overlooking
petty
differences
which
have
no
serious
reason
for
lasting
and
inconsiderable
communions
which
can
hardly
be
taken
to
express
any
broad
and
necessary
religious
lineaments
of
our
common
nature
this
is
just
in
accordance
with
that
maxim
about
the
state
which
we
have
more
than
once
used
the
state
is
of
the
religion
of
all
its
citizens
without
the
fanaticism
of
any
of
them
those
who
deny
this
either
think
so
poorly
of
the
state
that
they
do
not
like
to
see
religion
condescend
to
touch
the
state
or
they
think
so
poorly
of
religion
that
they
do
not
like
to
see
the
state
condescend
to
touch
religion
but
no
good
statesman
will
easily
think
thus
unworthily
either
of
the
state
or
of
religion
and
our
statesmen
of
both
parties
were
inclined
one
may
say
to
follow
the
natural
line
of
the
state
duty
and
to
make
in
ireland
some
fair
apportionment
of
church
property
between
large
and
radically
divided
religious
communions
in
that
country
but
then
it
was
discovered
that
in
great
britain
the
national
mind
as
it
is
called
is
grown
averse
to
endowments
for
religion
and
will
make
no
new
ones
and
though
this
in
itself
looks
general
and
solemn
enough
yet
there
were
found
political
philosophers
like
baxter
and
charles
buxton
to
give
it
a
look
of
more
generality
and
more
solemnity
still
and
to
elevate
by
their
dexterous
command
of
powerful
and
beautiful
language
this
supposed
edict
of
the
british
national
mind
into
a
sort
of
formula
for
expressing
a
great
law
of
religious
transition
and
progress
for
all
the
world
but
we
who
having
no
coherent
philosophy
must
not
let
ourselves
philosophise
only
see
that
the
english
and
scotch
nonconformists
have
a
great
horror
of
establishments
and
endowments
for
religion
which
they
assert
were
forbidden
by
christ
when
he
said
my
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
and
that
the
nonconformists
will
be
delighted
to
aid
statesmen
in
disestablishing
any
church
but
will
suffer
none
to
be
established
or
endowed
if
they
can
help
it
then
we
see
that
the
nonconformists
make
the
strength
of
the
liberal
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
and
that
therefore
the
leading
liberal
statesmen
to
get
the
support
of
the
nonconformists
forsake
the
notion
of
fairly
apportioning
church
property
in
ireland
among
the
chief
religious
communions
declare
that
the
national
mind
has
decided
against
new
endowments
and
propose
simply
to
disestablish
and
disendow
the
present
establishment
in
ireland
without
establishing
or
endowing
any
other
the
actual
power
in
short
by
virtue
of
which
the
liberal
party
in
the
house
of
commons
is
now
trying
to
disestablish
the
irish
church
is
not
the
power
of
reason
and
justice
it
is
the
power
of
the
nonconformists
antipathy
to
church
establishments
clearly
it
is
this
because
liberal
statesmen
relying
on
the
power
of
reason
and
justice
to
help
them
proposed
something
quite
different
from
what
they
now
propose
and
they
proposed
what
they
now
propose
and
talked
of
the
decision
of
the
national
mind
because
they
had
to
rely
on
the
english
and
scotch
nonconformists
and
clearly
the
nonconformists
are
actuated
by
antipathy
to
establishments
not
by
antipathy
to
the
injustice
and
irrationality
of
the
present
appropriation
of
church
property
in
ireland
because
spurgeon
in
his
eloquent
and
memorable
letter
expressly
avowed
that
he
would
sooner
leave
things
as
they
are
in
ireland
that
is
he
would
sooner
let
the
injustice
and
irrationality
of
the
present
appropriation
continue
than
do
anything
to
set
up
the
roman
image
that
is
than
give
the
catholics
their
fair
and
reasonable
share
of
church
property
most
indisputably
therefore
we
may
affirm
that
the
real
moving
power
by
which
the
liberal
party
are
now
operating
the
overthrow
of
the
irish
establishment
is
the
antipathy
of
the
nonconformists
to
church
establishments
and
not
the
sense
of
reason
or
justice
except
so
far
as
reason
and
justice
may
be
contained
in
this
antipathy
and
thus
the
matter
stands
at
present
now
surely
we
must
all
see
many
inconveniences
in
performing
the
operation
of
uprooting
this
evil
the
irish
church
establishment
in
this
particular
way
as
was
said
about
industry
and
freedom
and
gymnastics
we
shall
never
awaken
love
and
gratitude
by
this
mode
of
operation
for
it
is
pursued
not
in
view
of
reason
and
justice
and
human
perfection
and
all
that
enkindles
the
enthusiasm
of
men
but
it
is
pursued
in
view
of
a
certain
stock
notion
or
fetish
of
the
nonconformists
which
proscribes
church
establishments
and
yet
evidently
one
of
the
main
benefits
to
be
got
by
operating
on
the
irish
church
is
to
win
the
affections
of
the
irish
people
besides
this
an
operation
performed
in
virtue
of
a
mechanical
rule
or
fetish
like
the
supposed
decision
of
the
english
national
mind
against
new
endowments
does
not
easily
inspire
respect
in
its
adversaries
and
make
their
opposition
feeble
and
hardly
to
be
persisted
in
as
an
operation
evidently
done
in
virtue
of
reason
and
justice
might
for
reason
and
justice
have
in
them
something
persuasive
and
irresistible
but
a
fetish
or
mechanical
maxim
like
this
of
the
nonconformists
has
in
it
nothing
at
all
to
conciliate
either
the
affections
or
the
understanding
nay
it
provokes
the
of
other
fetishes
or
mechanical
maxims
on
the
opposite
side
by
which
the
confusion
and
hostility
already
prevalent
are
heightened
only
in
this
way
can
be
explained
the
apparition
of
such
fetishes
as
are
beginning
to
be
set
up
on
the
conservative
side
against
the
fetish
of
the
nonconformists
the
constitution
in
danger
the
bulwarks
of
british
freedom
menaced
the
lamp
of
the
reformation
put
out
no
popery
and
so
on
to
elevate
these
against
an
operation
relying
on
reason
and
justice
to
back
it
is
not
so
easy
or
so
tempting
to
human
infirmity
as
to
elevate
them
against
an
operation
relying
on
the
antipathy
to
church
establishments
to
back
it
for
after
all
no
popery
is
a
rallying
cry
which
touches
the
human
spirit
quite
as
vitally
as
no
church
establishments
that
is
to
say
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
in
themselves
touch
the
human
spirit
vitally
at
all
ought
the
believers
in
action
then
to
be
so
impatient
with
us
if
we
say
that
even
for
the
sake
of
this
operation
of
theirs
itself
and
its
satisfactory
accomplishment
it
is
more
important
to
make
our
consciousness
play
freely
round
the
stock
notion
or
habit
on
which
their
operation
relies
for
aid
than
to
lend
a
hand
to
it
straight
away
clearly
they
ought
not
because
nothing
is
so
effectual
for
operating
as
reason
and
justice
and
a
free
play
of
thought
will
either
disengage
the
reason
and
justice
lying
hid
in
the
nonconformist
fetish
and
make
them
effectual
or
else
it
will
help
to
get
this
fetish
out
of
the
way
and
to
let
statesmen
go
freely
where
reason
and
justice
take
them
so
suppose
we
take
this
absolute
rule
this
mechanical
maxim
of
spurgeon
and
the
nonconformists
that
church
establishments
are
bad
things
because
christ
said
my
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
suppose
we
try
and
make
our
consciousness
bathe
and
float
this
piece
of
petrifaction
for
such
it
now
is
and
bring
it
within
the
stream
of
the
vital
movement
of
our
thought
and
into
relation
with
the
whole
intelligible
law
of
things
an
enemy
and
a
disputant
might
probably
say
that
much
machinery
which
nonconformists
themselves
employ
the
liberation
society
which
exists
already
and
the
nonconformist
union
which
spurgeon
desires
to
see
existing
come
within
the
scope
of
christ
words
as
well
as
church
establishments
this
however
is
merely
a
negative
and
contentious
way
of
dealing
with
the
nonconformist
maxim
whereas
what
we
desire
is
to
bring
this
maxim
within
the
positive
and
vital
movement
of
our
thought
we
say
therefore
that
christ
words
mean
that
his
religion
is
a
force
of
inward
persuasion
acting
on
the
soul
and
not
a
force
of
outward
constraint
acting
on
the
body
and
if
the
nonconformist
maxim
against
church
establishments
and
church
endowments
has
warrant
given
to
it
from
what
christ
thus
meant
then
their
maxim
is
good
even
though
their
own
practice
in
the
matter
of
the
liberation
society
may
be
at
variance
with
it
and
here
we
can
not
but
remember
what
we
have
formerly
said
about
religion
miss
cobbe
and
the
british
college
of
health
in
the
new
road
in
religion
there
are
two
parts
the
part
of
thought
and
speculation
and
the
part
of
worship
and
devotion
christ
certainly
meant
his
religion
as
a
force
of
inward
persuasion
acting
on
the
soul
to
employ
both
parts
as
perfectly
as
possible
now
thought
and
speculation
is
eminently
an
individual
matter
and
worship
and
devotion
is
eminently
a
collective
matter
it
does
not
help
me
to
think
a
thing
more
clearly
that
thousands
of
other
people
are
thinking
the
same
but
it
does
help
me
to
worship
with
more
emotion
that
thousands
of
other
people
are
worshipping
with
me
the
consecration
of
common
consent
antiquity
public
establishment
rites
national
edifices
is
everything
for
religious
worship
just
what
makes
worship
impressive
says
joubert
is
its
publicity
its
external
manifestation
its
sound
its
splendour
its
observance
universally
and
visibly
holding
its
way
through
all
the
details
both
of
our
outward
and
of
our
inward
life
worship
therefore
should
have
in
it
as
little
as
possible
of
what
divides
us
and
should
be
as
much
as
possible
a
common
and
public
act
as
joubert
says
again
the
best
prayers
are
those
which
have
nothing
distinct
about
them
and
which
are
thus
of
the
nature
of
simple
adoration
for
the
same
devotion
as
he
says
in
another
place
unites
men
far
more
than
the
same
thought
and
knowledge
thought
and
knowledge
as
we
have
said
before
is
eminently
something
individual
and
of
our
own
the
more
we
possess
it
as
strictly
of
our
own
the
more
power
it
has
on
us
man
worships
best
therefore
with
the
community
he
philosophises
best
alone
so
it
seems
that
whoever
would
truly
give
effect
to
christ
declaration
that
his
religion
is
a
force
of
inward
persuasion
acting
on
the
soul
would
leave
our
thought
on
the
intellectual
aspects
of
christianity
as
individual
as
possible
but
would
make
christian
worship
as
collective
as
possible
worship
then
appears
to
be
eminently
a
matter
for
public
and
national
establishment
for
even
mr
bright
who
when
he
stands
in
spurgeon
great
tabernacle
is
so
ravished
with
admiration
will
hardly
say
that
the
great
tabernacle
and
its
worship
are
in
themselves
as
a
temple
and
service
of
religion
so
impressive
and
affecting
as
the
public
and
national
westminster
abbey
or
notre
dame
with
their
worship
and
when
very
soon
after
the
great
tabernacle
one
comes
plump
down
to
the
mass
of
private
and
individual
establishments
of
religious
worship
establishments
falling
like
the
british
college
of
health
in
the
new
road
conspicuously
short
of
what
a
public
and
national
establishment
might
be
then
one
can
not
but
feel
that
christ
command
to
make
his
religion
a
force
of
persuasion
to
the
soul
is
so
far
as
one
main
source
of
persuasion
is
concerned
altogether
set
at
nought
but
perhaps
the
nonconformists
worship
so
unimpressively
because
they
philosophise
so
keenly
and
one
part
of
religion
the
part
of
public
national
worship
they
have
subordinated
to
the
other
part
the
part
of
individual
thought
and
knowledge
this
however
their
organisation
in
congregations
forbids
us
to
admit
they
are
members
of
congregations
not
isolated
thinkers
and
a
true
play
of
individual
thought
is
at
least
as
much
impeded
by
membership
of
a
small
congregation
as
by
membership
of
a
great
church
thinking
by
batches
of
fifties
is
to
the
full
as
fatal
to
free
thought
as
thinking
by
batches
of
thousands
accordingly
we
have
had
occasion
already
to
notice
that
nonconformity
does
not
at
all
differ
from
the
established
church
by
having
worthier
or
more
philosophical
ideas
about
god
and
the
ordering
of
the
world
than
the
established
church
has
it
has
very
much
the
same
ideas
about
these
as
the
established
church
has
but
it
differs
from
the
established
church
in
that
its
worship
is
a
much
less
collective
and
national
affair
so
spurgeon
and
the
nonconformists
seem
to
have
misapprehended
the
true
meaning
of
christ
words
my
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
because
by
these
words
christ
meant
that
his
religion
was
to
work
on
the
soul
and
of
the
two
parts
of
the
soul
on
which
religion
works
the
thinking
and
speculative
part
and
the
feeling
and
imaginative
part
nonconformity
satisfies
the
first
no
better
than
the
established
churches
which
christ
by
these
words
is
supposed
to
have
condemned
satisfy
it
and
the
second
part
it
satisfies
much
worse
than
the
established
churches
and
thus
the
balance
of
advantage
seems
to
rest
with
the
established
churches
and
they
seem
to
have
apprehended
and
applied
christ
words
if
not
with
perfect
adequacy
at
least
less
inadequately
than
the
nonconformists
might
it
not
then
be
urged
with
great
force
that
the
way
to
do
good
in
presence
of
this
operation
for
uprooting
the
church
establishment
in
ireland
by
the
power
of
the
antipathy
to
publicly
establishing
or
endowing
religious
worship
is
not
by
lending
a
hand
straight
away
to
the
operation
and
hebraising
that
is
in
this
case
taking
an
uncritical
interpretation
of
certain
bible
words
as
our
absolute
rule
of
conduct
with
the
nonconformists
if
may
be
very
well
for
born
hebraisers
like
spurgeon
to
hebraise
but
for
liberal
statesmen
to
hebraise
is
surely
unsafe
and
to
see
poor
old
liberal
hacks
hebraising
whose
real
self
belongs
to
a
kind
of
negative
hellenism
a
state
of
moral
indifferency
without
intellectual
ardour
is
even
painful
and
when
by
our
hebraising
we
neither
do
what
the
better
mind
of
statesmen
prompted
them
to
do
nor
win
the
affections
of
the
people
we
want
to
conciliate
nor
yet
reduce
the
opposition
of
our
adversaries
but
rather
heighten
it
surely
it
may
be
not
unreasonable
to
hellenise
a
little
to
let
our
thought
and
consciousness
play
freely
about
our
proposed
operation
and
its
motives
dissolve
these
motives
if
they
are
unsound
which
certainly
they
have
some
appearance
at
any
rate
of
being
and
create
in
their
stead
if
they
are
a
set
of
sounder
and
more
persuasive
motives
conducting
to
a
more
solid
operation
may
not
the
man
who
promotes
this
be
giving
the
best
help
towards
finding
some
lasting
truth
to
minister
to
the
diseased
spirit
of
his
time
and
does
he
really
deserve
that
the
believers
in
action
should
grow
impatient
with
him
but
now
to
take
another
operation
which
does
not
at
this
moment
so
excite
people
feelings
as
the
disestablishment
of
the
irish
church
but
which
i
suppose
would
also
be
called
exactly
one
of
those
operations
of
simple
practical
reform
aiming
at
the
removal
of
some
particular
abuse
and
rigidly
restricted
to
that
object
to
which
a
liberal
ought
to
lend
a
hand
and
deserves
that
other
liberals
should
grow
impatient
with
him
if
he
does
not
this
operation
i
had
the
great
advantage
of
with
my
own
ears
hearing
discussed
in
the
house
of
commons
and
recommended
by
a
powerful
speech
from
that
famous
speaker
mr
bright
so
that
the
effeminate
horror
which
it
is
alleged
i
have
of
practical
reforms
of
this
kind
was
put
to
a
searching
test
and
if
it
survived
it
must
have
one
would
think
some
reason
or
other
to
support
it
and
can
hardly
quite
merit
the
stigma
of
its
present
name
the
operation
i
mean
was
that
which
the
real
estate
intestacy
bill
aimed
at
accomplishing
and
the
discussion
on
this
bill
i
heard
in
the
house
of
commons
the
bill
proposed
as
every
one
knows
to
prevent
the
land
of
a
man
who
dies
intestate
from
going
as
it
goes
now
to
his
eldest
son
and
was
thought
by
its
friends
and
by
its
enemies
to
be
a
step
towards
abating
the
now
almost
exclusive
possession
of
the
land
of
this
country
by
the
people
whom
we
call
the
barbarians
mr
bright
and
other
speakers
on
his
side
seemed
to
hold
that
there
is
a
kind
of
natural
law
or
fitness
of
things
which
assigns
to
all
a
children
a
right
to
equal
shares
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
property
after
his
death
and
that
if
without
depriving
a
man
of
an
englishman
prime
privilege
of
doing
what
he
likes
by
making
what
will
he
chooses
you
provide
that
when
he
makes
none
his
land
shall
be
divided
among
his
family
then
you
give
the
sanction
of
the
law
to
the
natural
fitness
of
things
and
inflict
a
sort
of
check
on
the
present
violation
of
this
by
the
barbarians
it
occurred
to
me
when
i
saw
mr
bright
and
his
friends
proceeding
in
this
way
to
ask
myself
a
question
if
the
almost
exclusive
possession
of
the
land
of
this
country
by
the
barbarians
is
a
bad
thing
is
this
practical
operation
of
the
liberals
and
the
stock
notion
on
which
it
seems
to
rest
about
the
right
of
children
to
share
equally
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
father
property
after
his
death
the
best
and
most
effective
means
of
dealing
with
it
or
is
it
best
dealt
with
by
letting
one
thought
and
consciousness
play
freely
and
naturally
upon
the
barbarians
this
liberal
operation
and
the
stock
notion
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
trying
to
get
as
near
as
we
can
to
the
intelligible
law
of
things
as
to
each
of
them
now
does
any
one
if
he
simply
and
naturally
reads
his
consciousness
discover
that
he
has
any
rights
at
all
for
my
part
the
deeper
i
go
in
my
own
consciousness
and
the
more
simply
i
abandon
myself
to
it
the
more
it
seems
to
tell
me
that
i
have
no
rights
at
all
only
duties
and
that
men
get
this
notion
of
rights
from
a
process
of
abstract
reasoning
inferring
that
the
obligations
they
are
conscious
of
towards
others
others
must
be
conscious
of
towards
them
and
not
from
any
direct
witness
of
consciousness
at
all
but
it
is
obvious
that
the
notion
of
a
right
arrived
at
in
this
way
is
likely
to
stand
as
a
formal
and
petrified
thing
deceiving
and
misleading
us
and
that
the
notions
got
directly
from
our
consciousness
ought
to
be
brought
to
bear
upon
it
and
to
control
it
so
it
is
unsafe
and
misleading
to
say
that
our
children
have
rights
against
us
what
is
true
and
safe
to
say
is
that
we
have
duties
towards
our
children
but
who
will
find
among
these
natural
duties
set
forth
to
us
by
our
consciousness
the
obligation
to
leave
to
all
our
children
an
equal
share
in
the
enjoyment
of
our
property
or
though
consciousness
tells
us
we
ought
to
provide
for
our
welfare
whose
consciousness
tells
him
that
the
enjoyment
of
property
is
in
itself
welfare
whether
our
children
welfare
is
best
served
by
their
all
sharing
equally
in
our
property
depends
on
circumstances
and
on
the
state
of
the
community
in
which
we
live
with
this
equal
sharing
society
could
not
for
example
have
organised
itself
afresh
out
of
the
chaos
left
by
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
and
to
have
an
organised
society
to
live
in
is
more
for
a
child
welfare
than
to
have
an
equal
share
of
his
father
property
so
we
see
how
little
convincing
force
the
stock
notion
on
which
the
real
estate
intestacy
bill
was
based
the
notion
that
in
the
nature
and
fitness
of
things
all
a
man
children
have
a
right
to
an
equal
share
in
the
enjoyment
of
what
he
leaves
really
has
and
how
powerless
therefore
it
must
of
necessity
be
to
persuade
and
win
any
one
who
has
habits
and
interests
which
disincline
him
to
it
on
the
other
hand
the
practical
operation
proposed
relies
entirely
if
it
is
to
be
effectual
in
altering
the
present
practice
of
the
barbarians
on
the
power
of
truth
and
persuasiveness
in
the
notion
which
it
seeks
to
consecrate
for
it
leaves
to
the
barbarians
full
liberty
to
continue
their
present
practice
to
which
all
their
habits
and
interests
incline
them
unless
the
promulgation
of
a
notion
which
we
have
seen
to
have
no
vital
efficacy
and
hold
upon
our
consciousness
shall
hinder
them
are
we
really
to
adorn
an
operation
of
this
kind
merely
because
it
proposes
to
do
something
with
all
the
favourable
epithets
of
simple
practical
definite
to
enlist
on
its
side
all
the
zeal
of
the
believers
in
action
and
to
call
indifference
to
it
a
really
effeminate
horror
of
useful
reforms
it
seems
to
me
quite
easy
to
show
that
a
free
disinterested
play
of
thought
on
the
barbarians
and
their
is
a
thousand
times
more
really
practical
a
thousand
times
more
likely
to
lead
to
some
effective
result
than
an
operation
such
as
that
of
which
we
have
been
now
speaking
for
if
casting
aside
the
impediments
of
stock
notions
and
mechanical
action
we
try
to
find
the
intelligible
law
of
things
respecting
a
great
class
such
as
we
have
in
this
country
does
not
our
consciousness
readily
tell
us
that
whether
the
perpetuation
of
such
a
class
is
for
its
own
real
welfare
and
for
the
real
welfare
of
the
community
depends
on
the
actual
circumstances
of
this
class
and
of
the
community
does
it
not
readily
tell
us
that
wealth
power
and
consideration
are
and
above
all
when
inherited
and
not
earned
in
themselves
trying
and
dangerous
things
as
bishop
wilson
excellently
says
riches
are
almost
always
abused
without
a
very
extraordinary
grace
but
this
extraordinary
grace
was
in
great
measure
supplied
by
the
circumstances
of
the
feudal
epoch
out
of
which
our
holding
class
with
its
rules
of
inheritance
sprang
the
labour
and
contentions
of
a
rude
nascent
and
struggling
society
supplied
it
these
perpetually
were
trying
chastising
and
forming
the
class
whose
predominance
was
then
needed
by
society
to
give
it
points
of
cohesion
and
was
not
so
harmful
to
themselves
because
they
were
thus
sharply
tried
and
exercised
but
in
a
luxurious
settled
and
easy
society
where
wealth
offers
the
means
of
enjoyment
a
thousand
times
more
and
the
temptation
to
abuse
them
is
thus
made
a
thousand
times
greater
the
exercising
discipline
is
at
the
same
time
taken
away
and
the
feudal
class
is
left
exposed
to
the
full
operation
of
the
natural
law
well
put
by
the
french
moralist
pouvoir
sans
savoir
est
fort
dangereux
and
for
my
part
when
i
regard
the
young
people
of
this
class
it
is
above
all
by
the
trial
and
shipwreck
made
of
their
own
welfare
by
the
circumstances
in
which
they
live
that
i
am
struck
how
far
better
it
would
have
been
for
nine
out
of
every
ten
among
them
if
they
had
had
their
own
way
to
make
in
the
world
and
not
been
tried
by
a
condition
for
which
they
had
not
the
extraordinary
grace
requisite
this
i
say
seems
to
be
what
a
man
consciousness
simply
consulted
would
tell
him
about
the
actual
welfare
of
our
barbarians
themselves
then
as
to
their
actual
effect
upon
the
welfare
of
the
community
how
can
this
be
salutary
if
a
class
which
by
the
very
possession
of
wealth
power
and
consideration
becomes
a
kind
of
ideal
or
standard
for
the
rest
of
the
community
is
tried
by
ease
and
pleasure
more
than
it
can
well
bear
and
almost
irresistibly
carried
away
from
excellence
and
strenuous
virtue
this
must
certainly
be
what
solomon
meant
when
he
said
as
he
who
putteth
a
stone
in
a
sling
so
is
he
that
giveth
honour
to
a
fool
for
any
one
can
perceive
how
this
honouring
of
a
false
ideal
not
of
intelligence
and
strenuous
virtue
but
of
wealth
and
station
pleasure
and
ease
is
as
a
stone
from
a
sling
to
kill
in
our
great
in
us
who
are
called
philistines
the
desire
before
spoken
of
which
by
nature
for
ever
carries
all
men
towards
that
which
is
lovely
and
to
leave
instead
of
it
only
a
blind
deteriorating
pursuit
for
ourselves
also
of
the
false
ideal
and
in
those
among
us
philistines
whom
this
desire
does
not
wholly
abandon
yet
having
no
excellent
ideal
set
forth
to
nourish
and
to
steady
it
it
meets
with
that
natural
bent
for
the
bathos
which
together
with
this
desire
itself
is
implanted
at
birth
in
the
breast
of
man
and
is
by
that
force
twisted
awry
and
borne
at
random
hither
and
thither
and
at
last
flung
upon
those
grotesque
and
hideous
forms
of
popular
religion
which
the
more
respectable
part
among
us
philistines
mistake
for
the
true
goal
of
man
desire
after
all
that
is
lovely
and
for
the
populace
this
false
idea
is
a
stone
which
kills
the
desire
before
it
can
even
arise
so
impossible
and
unattainable
for
them
do
the
conditions
of
that
which
is
lovely
appear
according
to
this
ideal
to
be
made
so
necessary
to
the
reaching
of
them
by
the
few
seems
the
falling
short
of
them
by
the
many
so
that
perhaps
of
the
actual
vulgarity
of
our
philistines
and
brutality
of
our
populace
the
barbarians
and
their
feudal
habits
of
succession
enduring
out
of
their
due
time
and
place
are
involuntarily
the
cause
in
a
great
degree
and
they
hurt
the
welfare
of
the
rest
of
the
community
at
the
same
time
that
as
we
have
seen
they
hurt
their
own
but
must
not
now
the
working
in
our
minds
of
considerations
like
these
to
which
culture
that
is
the
disinterested
and
active
use
of
reading
reflection
and
observation
carries
us
be
really
much
more
effectual
to
the
dissolution
of
feudal
habits
and
rules
of
succession
in
land
than
an
operation
like
the
real
estate
intestacy
bill
and
a
stock
notion
like
that
of
the
natural
right
of
all
a
man
children
to
an
equal
share
in
the
enjoyment
of
his
property
since
we
have
seen
that
this
mechanical
maxim
is
unsound
and
that
if
it
is
unsound
the
operation
relying
upon
it
can
not
possibly
be
effective
if
truth
and
reason
have
as
we
believe
any
natural
irresistible
effect
on
the
mind
of
man
it
must
these
considerations
when
culture
has
called
them
forth
and
given
them
free
course
in
our
minds
will
live
and
work
they
will
work
gradually
no
doubt
and
will
not
bring
us
ourselves
to
the
front
to
sit
in
high
place
and
put
them
into
effect
but
so
they
will
be
all
the
more
beneficial
everything
teaches
us
how
gradually
nature
would
have
all
profound
changes
brought
about
and
we
can
even
see
too
where
the
absolute
abrupt
stoppage
of
feudal
habits
has
worked
harm
and
appealing
to
the
sense
of
truth
and
reason
these
considerations
will
without
doubt
touch
and
move
all
those
of
even
the
barbarians
themselves
who
are
as
are
some
of
us
philistines
also
and
some
of
the
populace
beyond
their
fellows
quick
of
feeling
for
truth
and
reason
for
indeed
this
is
just
one
of
the
advantages
of
sweetness
and
light
over
fire
and
strength
that
sweetness
and
light
make
a
feudal
class
quietly
and
gradually
drop
its
feudal
habits
because
it
sees
them
at
variance
with
truth
and
reason
while
fire
and
strength
tear
them
passionately
off
it
because
it
applauded
lowe
when
he
called
or
was
supposed
to
call
the
drunken
and
venal
but
when
once
we
have
begun
to
recount
the
practical
operations
by
which
our
liberal
friends
work
for
the
removal
of
definite
evils
and
in
which
if
we
do
not
join
them
they
are
apt
to
grow
impatient
with
us
how
can
we
pass
over
that
very
interesting
operation
of
this
kind
the
attempt
to
enable
a
man
to
marry
his
deceased
sister
this
operation
too
like
that
for
abating
the
feudal
customs
of
succession
in
land
i
have
had
the
advantage
of
myself
seeing
and
hearing
my
liberal
friends
labour
at
i
was
lucky
enough
to
be
present
when
mr
chambers
i
think
brought
forward
in
the
house
of
commons
his
bill
for
enabling
a
man
to
marry
his
deceased
wife
sister
and
i
heard
the
speech
which
mr
chambers
then
made
in
support
of
his
bill
his
first
point
was
that
god
law
the
name
he
always
gave
to
the
book
of
leviticus
did
not
really
forbid
a
man
to
marry
his
deceased
wife
sister
god
law
not
forbidding
it
the
liberal
maxim
that
a
man
prime
right
and
happiness
is
to
do
as
he
likes
ought
at
once
to
come
into
force
and
to
annul
any
such
check
upon
the
assertion
of
personal
liberty
as
the
prohibition
to
marry
one
deceased
wife
sister
a
distinguished
liberal
supporter
of
mr
chambers
in
the
debate
which
followed
the
introduction
of
the
bill
produced
a
formula
of
much
beauty
and
neatness
for
conveying
in
brief
the
liberal
notions
on
this
head
liberty
said
he
is
the
law
of
human
life
and
therefore
the
moment
it
is
ascertained
that
god
law
the
book
of
leviticus
does
not
stop
the
way
man
law
the
law
of
liberty
asserts
its
right
and
makes
us
free
to
marry
our
deceased
wife
sister
and
this
exactly
falls
in
with
what
hepworth
dixon
who
may
almost
be
called
the
colenso
of
love
and
marriage
such
a
revolution
does
he
make
in
our
ideas
on
these
matters
just
as
colenso
does
in
our
ideas
on
religion
tells
us
of
the
notions
and
proceedings
of
our
kinsmen
in
america
with
that
affinity
of
genius
to
the
hebrew
genius
which
we
have
already
noticed
and
with
the
strong
belief
of
our
race
that
liberty
is
the
law
of
human
life
so
far
as
a
fixed
perfect
and
paramount
rule
of
conscience
the
bible
does
not
expressly
control
it
our
american
kinsmen
go
again
hepworth
dixon
tells
us
to
their
bible
the
mormons
to
the
patriarchs
and
the
old
testament
brother
noyes
to
paul
and
the
new
and
having
never
before
read
anything
else
but
their
bible
they
now
read
their
bible
over
again
and
make
all
manner
of
great
discoveries
there
all
these
discoveries
are
favourable
to
liberty
and
in
this
way
is
satisfied
that
double
craving
so
characteristic
of
the
philistine
and
so
eminently
exemplified
in
that
crowned
philistine
henry
the
eighth
the
craving
for
forbidden
fruit
and
the
craving
for
legality
hepworth
dixon
eloquent
writings
give
currency
over
here
to
these
important
discoveries
so
that
now
as
regards
love
and
marriage
we
seem
to
be
entering
with
all
our
sails
spread
upon
what
hepworth
dixon
its
apostle
and
evangelist
calls
a
gothic
revival
but
what
one
of
the
many
newspapers
that
so
greatly
admire
hepworth
dixon
lithe
and
sinewy
style
and
form
their
own
style
upon
it
calls
by
a
yet
bolder
and
more
striking
figure
a
great
sexual
insurrection
of
our
race
for
this
end
we
have
to
avert
our
eyes
from
everything
hellenic
and
fanciful
and
to
keep
them
steadily
fixed
upon
the
two
cardinal
points
of
the
bible
and
liberty
and
one
of
those
practical
operations
in
which
the
liberal
party
engage
and
in
which
we
are
summoned
to
join
them
directs
itself
entirely
as
we
have
seen
to
these
cardinal
points
and
may
almost
be
regarded
perhaps
as
a
kind
of
first
instalment
or
public
and
parliamentary
pledge
of
the
great
sexual
insurrection
of
our
race
but
here
as
elsewhere
what
we
seek
is
the
philistine
perfection
the
development
of
his
best
self
not
mere
liberty
for
his
ordinary
self
and
we
no
more
allow
absolute
validity
to
his
stock
maxim
liberty
is
the
law
of
human
life
than
we
allow
it
to
the
opposite
maxim
which
is
just
as
true
renouncement
is
the
law
of
human
life
for
we
know
that
the
only
perfect
freedom
is
as
our
religion
says
a
service
not
a
service
to
any
stock
maxim
but
an
elevation
of
our
best
self
and
a
harmonising
in
subordination
to
this
and
to
the
idea
of
a
perfected
humanity
all
the
multitudinous
turbulent
and
blind
impulses
of
our
ordinary
selves
now
the
philistine
great
defect
being
a
defect
in
delicacy
of
perception
to
cultivate
in
him
this
delicacy
to
render
it
independent
of
external
and
mechanical
rule
and
a
law
to
itself
is
what
seems
to
make
most
for
his
perfection
his
true
humanity
and
his
true
humanity
and
therefore
his
happiness
appears
to
lie
much
more
so
far
as
the
relations
of
love
and
marriage
are
concerned
in
becoming
alive
to
the
finer
shades
of
feeling
which
arise
within
these
relations
in
being
able
to
enter
with
tact
and
sympathy
into
the
subtle
instinctive
propensions
and
repugnances
of
the
person
with
whose
life
his
own
life
is
bound
up
to
make
them
his
own
to
direct
and
govern
in
harmony
with
them
the
arbitrary
range
of
his
personal
action
and
thus
to
enlarge
his
spiritual
and
intellectual
life
and
liberty
than
in
remaining
insensible
to
these
finer
shades
of
feeling
this
delicate
sympathy
in
giving
unchecked
range
so
far
as
he
can
to
his
mere
personal
action
in
allowing
no
limits
or
government
to
this
except
such
as
a
mechanical
external
law
imposes
and
in
thus
really
narrowing
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
ordinary
self
his
spiritual
and
intellectual
life
and
liberty
still
more
must
this
be
so
when
his
fixed
eternal
rule
his
law
is
supplied
to
him
from
a
source
which
is
less
fit
perhaps
to
supply
final
and
absolute
instructions
on
this
particular
topic
of
love
and
marriage
than
on
any
other
relation
of
human
life
bishop
wilson
who
is
full
of
examples
of
that
fruitful
hellenising
within
the
limits
of
hebraism
itself
of
that
renewing
of
the
stiff
and
stark
notions
of
hebraism
by
turning
upon
them
a
stream
of
fresh
thought
and
consciousness
which
we
have
already
noticed
in
paul
bishop
wilson
gives
an
admirable
lesson
to
rigid
hebraisers
like
mr
chambers
asking
themselves
does
god
law
that
is
the
book
of
leviticus
forbid
us
to
marry
our
wife
sister
does
law
that
is
again
the
book
of
leviticus
allow
us
to
marry
our
wife
sister
when
he
says
christian
duties
are
founded
on
reason
not
on
the
sovereign
authority
of
god
commanding
what
he
pleases
god
can
not
command
us
what
is
not
fit
to
be
believed
or
done
all
his
commands
being
founded
in
the
necessities
of
our
nature
and
immense
as
is
our
debt
to
the
hebrew
race
and
its
genius
incomparable
as
is
its
authority
on
certain
profoundly
important
sides
of
our
human
nature
worthy
as
it
is
to
be
described
as
having
uttered
for
those
sides
the
voice
of
the
deepest
necessities
of
our
nature
the
statutes
of
the
divine
and
eternal
order
of
things
the
law
of
god
who
that
is
not
manacled
and
hoodwinked
by
his
hebraism
can
believe
that
as
to
love
and
marriage
our
reason
and
the
necessities
of
our
humanity
have
their
true
sufficient
and
divine
law
expressed
for
them
by
the
voice
of
any
oriental
and
polygamous
nation
like
the
hebrews
who
i
say
will
believe
when
he
really
considers
the
matter
that
where
the
feminine
nature
the
feminine
ideal
and
our
relations
to
them
are
brought
into
question
the
delicate
and
apprehensive
genius
of
the
race
the
race
which
invented
the
muses
and
chivalry
and
the
madonna
is
to
find
its
last
word
on
this
question
in
the
institutions
of
a
semitic
people
whose
wisest
king
had
seven
hundred
wives
and
three
hundred
concubines
if
here
again
therefore
we
seem
to
minister
better
to
the
diseased
spirit
of
our
time
by
leading
it
to
think
about
the
operation
our
liberal
friends
have
in
hand
than
by
lending
a
hand
to
this
operation
ourselves
let
us
see
before
we
dismiss
from
our
view
the
practical
operations
of
our
liberal
friends
whether
the
same
thing
does
not
hold
good
as
to
their
celebrated
industrial
and
economical
labours
also
their
great
work
of
this
kind
is
of
course
their
policy
this
policy
as
having
enabled
the
poor
man
to
eat
untaxed
bread
and
as
having
wonderfully
augmented
trade
we
are
accustomed
to
speak
of
with
a
kind
of
solemnity
it
is
chiefly
on
their
having
been
our
leaders
in
this
policy
that
mr
bright
founds
for
himself
and
his
friends
the
claim
so
often
asserted
by
him
to
be
considered
guides
of
the
blind
teachers
of
the
ignorant
benefactors
slowly
and
laboriously
developing
in
the
conservative
party
and
in
the
country
that
which
mr
bright
is
fond
of
calling
the
growth
of
intelligence
the
object
as
is
well
known
of
all
the
friends
of
culture
also
and
the
great
end
and
aim
of
the
culture
that
we
preach
now
having
first
saluted
and
its
doctors
with
all
respect
let
us
see
whether
even
here
too
our
liberal
friends
do
not
pursue
their
operations
in
a
mechanical
way
without
reference
to
any
firm
intelligible
law
of
things
to
human
life
as
a
whole
and
human
happiness
and
whether
it
is
not
more
for
our
good
at
this
particular
moment
at
any
rate
if
instead
of
worshipping
with
them
hebraistically
as
a
kind
of
fetish
and
helping
them
to
pursue
it
as
an
end
in
and
for
itself
we
turn
the
free
stream
of
our
thought
upon
their
treatment
of
it
and
see
how
this
is
related
to
the
intelligible
law
of
human
life
and
to
national
being
and
happiness
in
short
suppose
we
hellenise
a
little
with
as
we
hellenised
with
the
real
estate
intestacy
bill
and
with
the
disestablishment
of
the
irish
church
by
the
power
of
the
nonconformists
antipathy
to
religious
establishments
and
endowments
and
see
whether
what
our
reprovers
beautifully
call
ministering
to
the
diseased
spirit
of
our
time
is
best
done
by
the
hellenising
method
of
proceeding
or
by
the
other
but
first
let
us
understand
how
the
policy
of
really
shapes
itself
for
our
liberal
friends
and
how
they
practically
employ
it
as
an
instrument
of
national
happiness
and
salvation
for
as
we
said
that
it
seemed
clearly
right
to
prevent
the
church
property
of
ireland
from
being
all
taken
for
the
benefit
of
the
church
of
a
small
minority
so
it
seems
clearly
right
that
the
poor
man
should
eat
untaxed
bread
and
generally
that
restrictions
and
regulations
which
for
the
supposed
benefit
of
some
particular
person
or
class
of
persons
make
the
price
of
things
artificially
high
here
or
artificially
low
there
and
interfere
with
the
natural
flow
of
trade
and
commerce
should
be
done
away
with
but
in
the
policy
of
our
liberal
friends
means
more
than
this
and
is
specially
valued
as
a
stimulant
to
the
production
of
wealth
as
they
call
it
and
to
the
increase
of
the
trade
business
and
population
of
the
country
we
have
already
seen
how
these
things
trade
business
and
population
are
mechanically
pursued
by
us
as
ends
precious
in
themselves
and
are
worshipped
as
what
we
call
fetishes
and
mr
bright
i
have
already
said
when
he
wishes
to
give
the
a
true
sense
of
what
makes
glory
and
greatness
tells
it
to
look
at
the
cities
it
has
built
the
railroads
it
has
made
the
manufactures
it
has
produced
so
to
this
idea
of
glory
and
greatness
the
which
our
liberal
friends
extol
so
solemnly
and
devoutly
has
served
to
the
increase
of
trade
business
and
population
and
for
this
it
is
prized
therefore
the
untaxing
of
the
poor
man
bread
has
with
this
view
of
national
happiness
been
used
not
so
much
to
make
the
existing
poor
man
bread
cheaper
or
more
abundant
but
rather
to
create
more
poor
men
to
eat
it
so
that
we
can
not
precisely
say
that
we
have
fewer
poor
men
than
we
had
before
but
we
can
say
with
truth
that
we
have
many
more
centres
of
industry
as
they
are
called
and
much
more
business
population
and
manufactures
and
if
we
are
sometimes
a
little
troubled
by
our
multitude
of
poor
men
yet
we
know
the
increase
of
manufactures
and
population
to
be
such
a
salutary
thing
in
itself
and
our
policy
begets
such
an
admirable
movement
creating
fresh
centres
of
industry
and
fresh
poor
men
here
while
we
were
thinking
about
our
poor
men
there
that
we
are
quite
dazzled
and
borne
away
and
more
and
more
industrial
movement
is
called
for
and
our
social
progress
seems
to
become
one
triumphant
and
enjoyable
course
of
what
is
sometimes
called
vulgarly
outrunning
the
constable
if
however
taking
some
other
criterion
of
man
than
the
cities
he
has
built
and
the
manufactures
he
has
produced
we
persist
in
thinking
that
our
social
progress
would
be
happier
if
there
were
not
so
many
of
us
so
very
poor
and
in
busying
ourselves
with
notions
of
in
some
way
or
other
adjusting
the
poor
man
and
business
one
to
the
other
and
not
multiplying
the
one
and
the
other
mechanically
and
blindly
then
our
liberal
friends
the
appointed
doctors
of
trade
take
us
up
very
sharply
art
is
long
says
the
times
and
life
is
short
for
the
most
part
we
settle
things
first
and
understand
them
afterwards
let
us
have
as
few
theories
as
possible
what
is
wanted
is
not
the
light
of
speculation
if
nothing
worked
well
of
which
the
theory
was
not
perfectly
understood
we
should
be
in
sad
confusion
the
relations
of
labour
and
capital
we
are
told
are
not
understood
yet
trade
and
commerce
on
the
whole
work
satisfactorily
i
quote
from
the
times
of
only
the
other
day
but
thoughts
like
these
as
i
have
often
pointed
out
are
thoroughly
british
thoughts
and
we
have
been
familiar
with
them
for
years
or
if
we
want
more
of
a
philosophy
of
the
matter
than
this
our
friends
have
two
axioms
for
us
axioms
laid
down
by
their
justly
esteemed
doctors
which
they
think
ought
to
satisfy
us
entirely
one
is
that
other
things
being
equal
the
more
population
increases
the
more
does
production
increase
to
keep
pace
with
it
because
men
by
their
numbers
and
contact
call
forth
all
manner
of
activities
and
resources
in
one
another
and
in
nature
which
when
men
are
few
and
sparse
are
never
developed
the
other
is
that
although
population
always
tends
to
equal
the
means
of
subsistence
yet
people
notions
of
what
subsistence
is
enlarge
as
civilisation
advances
and
take
in
a
number
of
things
beyond
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
and
thus
therefore
is
supplied
whatever
check
on
population
is
needed
but
the
error
of
our
friends
is
just
perhaps
that
they
apply
axioms
of
this
sort
as
if
they
were
laws
which
will
put
themselves
into
operation
without
trouble
or
planning
on
our
part
if
we
will
only
pursue
business
and
population
zealously
and
staunchly
whereas
the
real
truth
is
that
however
the
case
might
be
under
other
circumstances
yet
in
fact
as
we
now
manage
the
matter
the
enlarged
conception
of
what
is
included
in
subsistence
does
not
operate
to
prevent
the
bringing
into
the
world
of
numbers
of
people
who
but
just
attain
to
the
barest
necessaries
of
life
or
who
even
fail
to
attain
to
them
while
again
though
production
may
increase
as
population
increases
yet
it
seems
that
the
production
may
be
of
such
a
kind
and
so
related
or
rather
to
population
that
the
population
may
be
little
the
better
for
it
for
instance
with
the
increase
of
population
since
queen
elizabeth
time
the
production
of
stockings
has
wonderfully
increased
and
stockings
have
become
much
cheaper
and
procurable
in
much
greater
abundance
by
many
more
people
and
tend
perhaps
as
population
and
manufactures
increase
to
get
cheaper
and
cheaper
and
at
last
to
become
according
to
bastiat
favourite
image
a
common
free
property
of
the
human
race
like
light
and
air
but
bread
and
bacon
have
not
become
much
cheaper
with
the
increase
of
population
since
queen
time
nor
procurable
in
much
greater
abundance
by
many
more
people
neither
do
they
seem
at
all
to
promise
to
become
like
light
and
air
a
common
free
property
of
the
human
race
and
if
bread
and
bacon
have
not
kept
pace
with
our
population
and
we
have
many
more
people
in
want
of
them
now
than
in
queen
elizabeth
time
it
seems
vain
to
tell
us
that
have
kept
pace
with
our
population
or
even
more
than
kept
pace
with
it
and
that
we
are
to
get
our
comfort
out
of
that
in
short
it
turns
out
that
our
pursuit
of
as
of
so
many
other
things
has
been
too
mechanical
we
fix
upon
some
object
which
in
this
case
is
the
production
of
wealth
and
the
increase
of
manufactures
population
and
commerce
through
trade
as
a
kind
of
one
thing
needful
or
end
in
itself
and
then
we
pursue
it
staunchly
and
mechanically
and
say
that
it
is
our
duty
to
pursue
it
staunchly
and
mechanically
not
to
see
how
it
is
related
to
the
whole
intelligible
law
of
things
and
to
full
human
perfection
or
to
treat
it
as
the
piece
of
machinery
of
varying
value
as
its
relations
to
the
intelligible
law
of
things
vary
which
it
really
is
so
it
is
of
no
use
to
say
to
the
times
and
to
our
liberal
friends
rejoicing
in
the
possession
of
their
talisman
of
that
about
one
in
nineteen
of
our
population
is
a
pauper
and
that
this
being
so
trade
and
commerce
can
hardly
be
said
to
prove
by
their
satisfactory
working
that
it
matters
nothing
whether
the
relations
between
labour
and
capital
are
understood
or
not
nay
that
we
can
hardly
be
said
not
to
be
in
sad
confusion
for
here
comes
in
our
faith
in
the
staunch
mechanical
pursuit
of
a
fixed
object
and
covers
itself
with
that
imposing
and
colossal
necessitarianism
of
the
times
which
we
have
before
noticed
and
this
necessitarianism
taking
for
granted
that
an
increase
in
trade
and
population
is
a
good
in
itself
one
of
the
chiefest
of
goods
tells
us
that
disturbances
of
human
happiness
caused
by
ebbs
and
flows
in
the
tide
of
trade
and
business
which
on
the
whole
steadily
mounts
are
inevitable
and
not
to
be
quarrelled
with
this
firm
philosophy
i
seek
to
call
to
mind
when
i
am
in
the
east
of
london
whither
my
avocations
often
lead
me
and
indeed
to
fortify
myself
against
the
depressing
sights
which
on
these
occasions
assail
us
i
have
transcribed
from
the
times
one
strain
of
this
kind
full
of
the
finest
economical
doctrine
and
always
carry
it
about
with
me
the
passage
is
this
the
east
end
is
the
most
commercial
the
most
industrial
the
most
fluctuating
region
of
the
metropolis
it
is
always
the
first
to
suffer
for
it
is
the
creature
of
prosperity
and
falls
to
the
ground
the
instant
there
is
no
wind
to
bear
it
up
the
whole
of
that
region
is
covered
with
huge
docks
shipyards
manufactories
and
a
wilderness
of
small
houses
all
full
of
life
and
happiness
in
brisk
times
but
in
dull
times
withered
and
lifeless
like
the
deserts
we
read
of
in
the
east
now
their
brief
spring
is
over
there
is
no
one
to
blame
for
this
it
is
the
result
of
nature
simplest
laws
we
must
all
agree
that
it
is
impossible
that
anything
can
be
firmer
than
this
or
show
a
surer
faith
in
the
working
of
as
our
liberal
friends
understand
and
employ
it
but
if
we
still
at
all
doubt
whether
the
indefinite
multiplication
of
manufactories
and
small
houses
can
be
such
an
absolute
good
in
itself
as
to
counterbalance
the
indefinite
multiplication
of
poor
people
we
shall
learn
that
this
multiplication
of
poor
people
too
is
an
absolute
good
in
itself
and
the
result
of
divine
and
beautiful
laws
this
is
indeed
a
favourite
thesis
with
our
philistine
friends
and
i
have
already
noticed
the
pride
and
gratitude
with
which
they
receive
certain
articles
in
the
times
dilating
in
thankful
and
solemn
language
on
the
majestic
growth
of
our
population
but
i
prefer
to
quote
now
on
this
topic
the
words
of
an
ingenious
young
scotch
writer
robert
buchanan
because
he
invests
with
so
much
imagination
and
poetry
this
current
idea
of
the
blessed
and
even
divine
character
which
the
multiplying
of
population
is
supposed
in
itself
to
have
we
move
to
multiplicity
says
robert
buchanan
if
there
is
one
quality
which
seems
god
and
his
exclusively
it
seems
that
divine
philoprogenitiveness
that
passionate
love
of
distribution
and
expansion
into
living
forms
every
animal
added
seems
a
new
ecstasy
to
the
maker
every
life
added
a
new
embodiment
of
his
love
he
would
swarm
the
earth
with
beings
there
are
never
enough
life
life
life
faces
gleaming
hearts
beating
must
fill
every
cranny
not
a
corner
is
suffered
to
remain
empty
the
whole
earth
breeds
and
god
glories
it
is
a
little
unjust
perhaps
to
attribute
to
the
divinity
exclusively
this
philoprogenitiveness
which
the
british
philistine
and
the
poorer
class
of
irish
may
certainly
claim
to
share
with
him
yet
how
inspiriting
is
here
the
whole
strain
of
thought
and
these
beautiful
words
too
i
carry
about
with
me
in
the
east
of
london
and
often
read
them
there
they
are
quite
in
agreement
with
the
popular
language
one
is
accustomed
to
hear
about
children
and
large
families
which
describes
children
as
sent
and
a
line
of
poetry
which
robert
buchanan
throws
in
presently
after
the
poetical
prose
i
have
quoted
is
the
old
story
of
the
time
this
fine
line
too
naturally
connects
itself
when
one
is
in
the
east
of
london
with
the
idea
of
god
desire
to
swarm
the
earth
with
beings
because
the
swarming
of
the
earth
with
beings
does
indeed
in
the
east
of
london
so
seem
to
revive
the
old
story
of
the
time
such
a
number
of
the
people
one
meets
there
having
hardly
a
rag
to
cover
them
and
the
more
the
swarming
goes
on
the
more
it
promises
to
revive
this
old
story
and
when
the
story
is
perfectly
revived
the
swarming
quite
completed
and
every
cranny
then
too
no
doubt
the
faces
in
the
east
of
london
will
be
gleaming
faces
which
robert
buchanan
says
it
is
god
desire
they
should
be
and
which
every
one
must
perceive
they
are
not
at
present
but
on
the
contrary
very
miserable
but
to
prevent
all
this
philosophy
and
poetry
from
quite
running
away
with
us
and
making
us
think
with
the
times
and
our
practical
liberal
and
the
british
philistines
generally
that
the
increase
of
small
houses
and
manufactories
or
the
increase
of
population
are
absolute
goods
in
themselves
to
be
mechanically
pursued
and
to
be
worshipped
like
fetishes
to
prevent
this
we
have
got
that
notion
of
ours
immoveably
fixed
of
which
i
have
long
ago
spoken
the
notion
that
culture
or
the
study
of
perfection
leads
us
to
conceive
of
no
perfection
as
being
real
which
is
not
a
general
perfection
embracing
all
our
with
whom
we
have
to
do
such
is
the
sympathy
which
binds
humanity
together
that
we
are
indeed
as
our
religion
says
members
of
one
body
and
if
one
member
suffer
all
the
members
suffer
with
it
individual
perfection
is
impossible
so
long
as
the
rest
of
mankind
are
not
perfected
along
with
us
the
multitude
of
the
wise
is
the
welfare
of
the
world
says
the
wise
man
and
to
this
effect
that
excellent
and
often
quoted
guide
of
ours
bishop
wilson
has
some
striking
words
it
is
not
says
he
so
much
our
neighbour
interest
as
our
own
that
we
love
him
and
again
he
says
our
salvation
does
in
some
measure
depend
upon
that
of
others
and
the
author
of
the
imitation
puts
the
same
thing
admirably
when
he
says
obscurior
etiam
via
ad
coelum
videbatur
quando
tam
pauci
regnum
coelorum
quaerere
curabant
the
fewer
there
are
who
follow
the
way
to
perfection
the
harder
that
way
is
to
find
so
all
our
in
the
east
of
london
and
elsewhere
we
must
take
along
with
us
in
the
progress
towards
perfection
if
we
ourselves
really
as
we
profess
want
to
be
perfect
and
we
must
not
let
the
worship
of
any
fetish
any
machinery
such
as
manufactures
or
population
which
are
not
like
perfection
absolute
goods
in
themselves
though
we
think
them
so
create
for
us
such
a
multitude
of
miserable
sunken
and
ignorant
human
beings
that
to
carry
them
all
along
with
us
is
impossible
and
perforce
they
must
for
the
most
part
be
left
by
us
in
their
degradation
and
wretchedness
but
evidently
the
conception
of
trade
on
which
our
liberal
friends
vaunt
themselves
and
in
which
they
think
they
have
found
the
secret
of
national
prosperity
evidently
i
say
the
mere
unfettered
pursuit
of
the
production
of
wealth
and
the
mere
mechanical
multiplying
for
this
end
of
manufactures
and
population
threatens
to
create
for
us
if
it
has
not
created
already
those
vast
miserable
unmanageable
masses
of
sunken
people
one
pauper
at
the
present
moment
for
every
nineteen
of
us
to
the
existence
of
which
we
are
as
we
have
seen
absolutely
forbidden
to
reconcile
ourselves
in
spite
of
all
that
the
philosophy
of
the
times
and
the
poetry
of
robert
buchanan
may
say
to
persuade
us
and
though
hebraism
following
its
best
and
highest
instinct
identical
as
we
have
seen
with
that
of
hellenism
in
its
final
aim
the
aim
of
perfection
teaches
us
this
very
clearly
and
though
from
hebraising
counsellors
the
bible
bishop
wilson
the
author
of
the
imitation
i
have
preferred
as
well
i
may
for
from
this
rock
of
hebraism
we
are
all
hewn
to
draw
the
texts
which
we
use
to
bring
home
to
our
minds
this
teaching
yet
hebraism
seems
powerless
almost
as
powerless
as
our
liberal
friends
to
deal
efficaciously
with
our
masses
of
pauperism
and
to
prevent
their
accumulating
still
more
hebraism
builds
churches
indeed
for
these
masses
and
sends
missionaries
among
them
above
all
it
sets
itself
against
the
social
necessitarianism
of
the
times
and
refuses
to
accept
their
degradation
as
inevitable
but
with
regard
to
their
accumulation
it
seems
to
be
led
to
the
very
same
conclusions
though
from
a
point
of
view
of
its
own
as
our
liberal
friends
hebraism
with
that
mechanical
and
misleading
use
of
the
letter
of
scripture
on
which
we
have
already
commented
is
governed
by
such
texts
as
be
fruitful
and
multiply
the
edict
of
god
law
as
mr
chambers
would
say
or
by
the
declaration
of
what
he
would
call
god
words
in
the
psalms
that
the
man
who
has
a
great
number
of
children
is
thereby
made
happy
and
in
conjunction
with
such
texts
as
these
it
is
apt
to
place
another
text
the
poor
shall
never
cease
out
of
the
thus
hebraism
is
conducted
to
nearly
the
same
notion
as
the
popular
mind
and
as
robert
buchanan
that
children
are
sent
and
that
the
divine
nature
takes
a
delight
in
swarming
the
east
end
of
london
with
paupers
only
when
they
are
perishing
in
their
helplessness
and
wretchedness
it
asserts
the
christian
duty
of
succouring
them
instead
of
saying
like
the
times
now
their
brief
spring
is
over
there
is
nobody
to
blame
for
this
it
is
the
result
of
nature
simplest
laws
but
like
the
times
hebraism
despairs
of
any
help
from
knowledge
and
says
that
what
is
wanted
is
not
the
light
of
speculation
i
remember
only
the
other
day
a
good
man
looking
with
me
upon
a
multitude
of
children
who
were
gathered
before
us
in
one
of
the
most
miserable
regions
of
london
children
eaten
up
with
disease
fed
neglected
by
their
parents
without
health
without
home
without
hope
said
to
me
the
one
thing
really
needful
is
to
teach
these
little
ones
to
succour
one
another
if
only
with
a
cup
of
cold
water
but
now
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
one
hears
nothing
but
the
cry
for
knowledge
knowledge
knowledge
and
yet
surely
so
long
as
these
children
are
there
in
these
festering
masses
without
health
without
home
without
hope
and
so
long
as
their
multitude
is
perpetually
swelling
charged
with
misery
they
must
still
be
for
themselves
charged
with
misery
they
must
still
be
for
us
whether
they
help
one
another
with
a
cup
of
cold
water
or
no
and
the
knowledge
how
to
prevent
their
accumulating
is
necessary
even
to
give
their
moral
life
and
growth
a
fair
chance
may
we
not
therefore
say
that
neither
the
true
hebraism
of
this
good
man
willing
to
spend
and
be
spent
for
these
sunken
multitudes
nor
what
i
may
call
the
spurious
hebraism
of
our
liberal
friends
mechanically
worshipping
their
fetish
of
the
production
of
wealth
and
of
the
increase
of
manufactures
and
population
and
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
left
so
long
as
this
increase
goes
on
avail
us
much
here
and
that
here
again
what
we
want
is
hellenism
the
letting
our
consciousness
play
freely
and
simply
upon
the
facts
before
us
and
listening
to
what
it
tells
us
of
the
intelligible
law
of
things
as
concerns
them
and
surely
what
it
tells
us
is
that
a
man
children
are
not
really
sent
any
more
than
the
pictures
upon
his
wall
or
the
horses
in
his
stable
are
sent
and
that
to
bring
people
into
the
world
when
one
can
not
afford
to
keep
them
and
oneself
decently
and
not
too
precariously
or
to
bring
more
of
them
into
the
world
than
one
can
afford
to
keep
thus
is
whatever
the
times
and
robert
buchanan
may
say
by
no
means
an
accomplishment
of
the
divine
will
or
a
fulfilment
of
simplest
laws
but
is
just
as
wrong
just
as
contrary
to
reason
and
the
will
of
god
as
for
a
man
to
have
horses
or
carriages
or
pictures
when
he
can
not
afford
them
or
to
have
more
of
them
than
he
can
afford
and
that
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
the
larger
the
scale
on
which
the
violation
of
reason
laws
is
practised
and
the
longer
it
is
persisted
in
the
greater
must
be
the
confusion
and
final
trouble
surely
no
laudations
of
no
meetings
of
bishops
and
clergy
in
the
east
end
of
london
no
reading
of
papers
and
reports
can
tell
us
anything
about
our
social
condition
which
it
more
concerns
us
to
know
than
that
and
not
only
to
know
but
habitually
to
have
the
knowledge
present
and
to
act
upon
it
as
one
acts
upon
the
knowledge
that
water
wets
and
fire
burns
and
not
only
the
sunken
populace
of
our
great
cities
are
concerned
to
know
it
and
the
pauper
twentieth
of
our
population
we
philistines
of
the
too
are
concerned
to
know
it
and
all
who
have
to
set
themselves
to
make
progress
in
perfection
but
we
all
know
it
already
some
one
will
say
it
is
the
simplest
law
of
prudence
but
how
little
reality
must
there
be
in
our
knowledge
of
it
how
little
can
we
be
putting
it
in
practice
how
little
is
it
likely
to
penetrate
among
the
poor
and
struggling
masses
of
our
population
and
to
better
our
condition
so
long
as
an
unintelligent
hebraism
of
one
sort
keeps
repeating
as
an
absolute
eternal
word
of
god
the
which
says
that
the
man
who
has
a
great
many
children
is
happy
or
an
unintelligent
hebraism
of
another
sort
keeps
assigning
as
an
absolute
proof
of
national
prosperity
the
multiplying
of
manufactures
and
population
surely
the
one
set
of
hebraisers
have
to
learn
that
their
was
composed
at
the
resettlement
of
jerusalem
after
the
captivity
when
the
jews
of
jerusalem
were
a
handful
an
undermanned
garrison
and
every
child
was
a
blessing
and
that
the
word
of
god
or
the
voice
of
the
divine
order
of
things
declares
the
possession
of
a
great
many
children
to
be
a
blessing
only
when
it
really
is
so
and
the
other
set
of
hebraisers
have
they
not
to
learn
that
if
they
call
their
private
acquaintances
imprudent
and
unlucky
when
with
no
means
of
support
for
them
or
with
precarious
means
they
have
a
large
family
of
children
then
they
ought
not
to
call
the
state
well
managed
and
prosperous
merely
because
its
manufactures
and
its
citizens
multiply
if
the
manufactures
which
bring
new
citizens
into
existence
just
as
much
as
if
they
had
actually
begotten
them
bring
more
of
them
into
existence
than
they
can
maintain
or
are
too
precarious
to
go
on
maintaining
those
whom
for
a
while
they
maintained
hellenism
surely
or
the
habit
of
fixing
our
mind
upon
the
intelligible
law
of
things
is
most
salutary
if
it
makes
us
see
that
the
only
absolute
good
the
only
absolute
and
eternal
object
prescribed
to
us
by
law
or
the
divine
order
of
things
is
the
progress
towards
perfection
our
own
progress
towards
it
and
the
progress
of
humanity
and
therefore
for
every
individual
man
and
for
every
society
of
men
the
possession
and
multiplication
of
children
like
the
possession
and
multiplication
of
horses
and
pictures
is
to
be
accounted
good
or
bad
not
in
itself
but
with
reference
to
this
object
and
the
progress
towards
it
and
as
no
man
is
to
be
excused
in
having
horses
or
pictures
if
his
having
them
hinders
his
own
or
others
progress
towards
perfection
and
makes
them
lead
a
servile
and
ignoble
life
so
is
no
man
to
be
excused
for
having
children
if
his
having
them
makes
him
or
others
lead
this
plain
thoughts
of
this
kind
are
surely
the
spontaneous
product
of
our
consciousness
when
it
is
allowed
to
play
freely
and
disinterestedly
upon
the
actual
facts
of
our
social
condition
and
upon
our
stock
notions
and
stock
habits
in
respect
to
it
firmly
grasped
and
simply
uttered
they
are
more
likely
one
can
not
but
think
to
better
that
condition
and
to
diminish
our
formidable
rate
of
one
pauper
to
every
nineteen
of
us
than
is
the
hebraising
and
mechanical
pursuit
of
by
our
liberal
friends
so
that
here
as
elsewhere
the
practical
operations
of
our
liberal
friends
by
which
they
set
so
much
store
and
in
which
they
invite
us
to
join
them
and
to
show
what
mr
bright
calls
a
commendable
interest
do
not
seem
to
us
so
practical
for
real
good
as
they
think
and
our
liberal
friends
seem
to
us
themselves
to
need
to
hellenise
as
we
say
a
little
that
is
to
examine
into
the
nature
of
real
good
and
to
listen
to
what
their
consciousness
tells
them
about
it
rather
than
to
pursue
with
such
heat
and
confidence
their
present
practical
operations
and
it
is
clear
that
they
have
no
just
cause
so
far
as
regards
several
operations
of
theirs
which
we
have
canvassed
to
reproach
us
with
delicate
conservative
scepticism
for
often
by
hellenising
we
seem
to
subvert
stock
conservative
notions
and
usages
more
effectually
than
they
subvert
them
by
hebraising
but
in
truth
the
free
spontaneous
play
of
consciousness
with
which
culture
tries
to
float
our
stock
habits
of
thinking
and
acting
is
by
its
very
nature
as
has
been
said
disinterested
sometimes
the
result
of
floating
them
may
be
agreeable
to
this
party
sometimes
to
that
now
it
may
be
unwelcome
to
our
liberals
now
to
our
conservatives
but
what
culture
seeks
is
above
all
to
float
them
to
prevent
their
being
stiff
and
stark
pieces
of
petrifaction
any
longer
it
is
mere
hebraising
if
we
stop
short
and
refuse
to
let
our
consciousness
play
freely
whenever
we
or
our
friends
do
not
happen
to
like
what
it
discovers
to
us
this
is
to
make
the
liberal
party
or
the
conservative
party
our
one
thing
needful
instead
of
human
perfection
and
we
have
seen
what
mischief
arises
from
making
an
even
greater
thing
than
the
liberal
or
the
conservative
party
the
predominance
of
the
moral
side
in
man
our
one
thing
needful
but
wherever
the
free
play
of
our
consciousness
leads
us
we
shall
follow
believing
that
in
this
way
we
shall
tend
to
make
good
at
all
points
what
is
wanting
to
us
and
so
shall
be
brought
nearer
to
our
complete
human
perfection
thus
we
may
often
perhaps
praise
much
that
a
liberal
thinks
himself
forbidden
to
praise
and
yet
blame
much
that
a
called
conservative
thinks
himself
forbidden
to
blame
because
these
are
both
of
them
partisans
and
no
partisan
can
afford
to
be
thus
disinterested
but
we
who
are
not
partisans
can
afford
it
and
so
after
we
have
seen
what
nonconformists
lose
by
being
locked
up
in
their
new
road
forms
of
religious
institution
we
can
let
ourselves
see
on
the
other
hand
how
their
ministers
in
a
time
of
movement
of
ideas
like
our
present
time
are
apt
to
be
more
exempt
than
the
ministers
of
a
great
church
establishment
from
that
confidence
and
sense
of
superiority
to
such
a
movement
which
are
natural
to
a
powerful
hierarchy
and
which
in
archdeacon
denison
for
instance
seem
almost
carried
to
such
a
pitch
that
they
may
become
one
can
not
but
fear
his
spiritual
ruin
but
seeing
this
does
not
dispose
us
therefore
to
lock
up
all
the
nation
in
forms
of
worship
of
the
new
road
type
but
it
points
us
to
the
quite
new
ideal
of
combining
grand
and
national
forms
of
worship
with
an
openness
and
movement
of
mind
not
yet
found
in
any
hierarchy
so
again
if
we
see
what
is
called
ritualism
making
conquests
in
our
puritan
class
we
may
rejoice
that
portions
of
this
class
should
have
become
alive
to
the
aesthetical
weakness
of
their
position
even
although
they
have
not
yet
become
alive
to
the
intellectual
weakness
of
it
in
puritanism
on
the
other
hand
we
can
respect
that
idea
of
dealing
sincerely
with
oneself
which
is
at
once
the
great
force
of
puritanism
puritanism
great
superiority
over
all
products
like
ritualism
of
our
catholicising
tendencies
and
also
an
idea
rich
in
the
latent
seeds
of
intellectual
promise
but
we
do
this
without
on
that
account
hiding
from
ourselves
that
puritanism
has
by
hebraising
misapplied
that
idea
has
as
yet
developed
none
or
hardly
one
of
those
seeds
and
that
its
triumph
at
its
present
stage
of
development
would
be
baneful
everything
in
short
confirms
us
in
the
doctrine
so
unpalatable
to
the
believers
in
action
that
our
main
business
at
the
present
moment
is
not
so
much
to
work
away
at
certain
crude
reforms
of
which
we
have
already
the
scheme
in
our
own
mind
as
to
create
through
the
help
of
that
culture
which
at
the
very
outset
we
began
by
praising
and
recommending
a
frame
of
mind
out
of
which
really
fruitful
reforms
may
with
time
grow
at
any
rate
we
ourselves
must
put
up
with
our
friends
impatience
and
with
their
reproaches
against
cultivated
inaction
and
must
still
decline
to
lend
a
hand
to
their
practical
operations
until
we
for
our
own
part
at
least
have
grown
a
little
clearer
about
the
nature
of
real
good
and
have
arrived
nearer
to
a
condition
of
mind
out
of
which
really
fruitful
and
solid
operations
may
spring
in
the
meanwhile
since
our
liberal
friends
keep
loudly
and
resolutely
assuring
us
that
their
actual
operations
at
present
are
fruitful
and
solid
let
us
in
each
case
keep
testing
these
operations
in
the
simple
way
we
have
indicated
by
letting
the
natural
stream
of
our
consciousness
flow
over
them
freely
and
if
they
stand
this
test
successfully
then
let
us
give
them
our
commendable
interest
but
not
else
for
example
our
liberal
friends
assure
us
at
the
very
top
of
their
voices
that
their
present
actual
operation
for
the
disestablishment
of
the
irish
church
is
fruitful
and
solid
but
what
if
on
testing
it
the
truth
appears
to
be
that
the
statesmen
and
reasonable
people
of
both
parties
wished
for
much
the
same
thing
the
fair
apportionment
of
the
church
property
of
ireland
among
the
principal
religious
bodies
there
but
that
behind
the
statesmen
and
reasonable
people
there
was
on
one
side
a
mass
of
tory
prejudice
and
on
the
other
a
mass
of
nonconformist
prejudice
to
which
such
an
arrangement
was
unpalatable
well
the
natural
way
one
thinks
would
have
been
for
the
statesmen
and
reasonable
people
of
both
sides
to
have
united
and
to
have
allayed
and
dissipated
so
far
as
they
could
the
resistance
of
their
respective
extremes
and
where
they
could
not
to
have
confronted
it
in
concert
but
we
see
that
instead
of
this
liberal
statesmen
waited
to
trip
up
their
rivals
if
they
proposed
the
arrangement
which
both
knew
to
be
reasonable
by
means
of
the
prejudice
of
their
own
nonconformist
extreme
and
then
themselves
proposing
an
arrangement
to
flatter
this
prejudice
made
the
other
arrangement
which
they
themselves
knew
to
be
reasonable
out
of
the
question
and
drove
their
rivals
in
their
turn
to
blow
up
with
all
their
might
in
the
hope
of
baffling
them
a
great
fire
among
their
own
tory
extreme
of
fierce
prejudice
and
religious
bigotry
a
fire
which
once
kindled
may
always
very
easily
spread
further
if
i
say
on
testing
the
present
operation
of
our
liberal
friends
for
the
disestablishment
of
the
irish
church
the
truth
about
it
appears
to
be
very
much
this
then
i
think
even
with
a
triumphant
liberal
majority
and
with
our
liberal
friends
making
impassioned
appeals
to
us
to
take
a
commendable
interest
in
their
operation
and
them
and
to
rally
round
what
sir
henry
hoare
who
may
be
described
perhaps
as
a
barbarian
converted
to
philistinism
as
i
on
the
other
hand
seem
to
be
a
philistine
converted
to
culture
finely
calls
the
conscientiousness
of
a
gladstone
and
the
intellect
of
a
bright
it
is
rather
our
duty
to
abstain
and
instead
of
lending
a
hand
to
the
operation
of
our
liberal
friends
to
do
what
we
can
to
abate
and
dissolve
the
mass
of
prejudice
tory
or
nonconformist
which
makes
so
doubtfully
begotten
and
equivocal
an
operation
as
the
present
producible
and
possible
and
so
we
bring
to
an
end
what
we
had
to
say
in
praise
of
culture
and
in
evidence
of
its
special
utility
for
the
circumstances
in
which
we
find
ourselves
and
the
confusion
which
environs
us
through
culture
seems
to
lie
our
way
not
only
to
perfection
but
even
to
safety
resolutely
refusing
to
lend
a
hand
to
the
imperfect
operations
of
our
liberal
friends
disregarding
their
impatience
taunts
and
reproaches
firmly
bent
on
trying
to
find
in
the
intelligible
law
of
things
a
firmer
and
sounder
basis
for
future
practice
than
any
which
we
have
at
present
and
believing
this
search
and
discovery
to
be
for
our
generation
and
circumstances
of
yet
more
vital
and
pressing
importance
than
practice
itself
we
nevertheless
may
do
more
perhaps
we
poor
disparaged
followers
of
culture
to
make
the
actual
present
and
the
frame
of
society
in
which
we
live
solid
and
seaworthy
than
all
which
our
bustling
politicians
can
do
for
we
have
seen
how
much
of
our
disorders
and
perplexities
is
due
to
the
disbelief
among
the
classes
and
combinations
of
men
barbarian
or
philistine
which
have
hitherto
governed
our
society
in
right
reason
in
a
paramount
best
self
to
the
inevitable
decay
and
of
the
organisations
by
which
asserting
and
expressing
in
these
organisations
their
ordinary
self
only
they
have
so
long
ruled
us
and
to
their
irresolution
when
the
society
which
their
conscience
tells
them
they
have
made
and
still
manage
not
with
right
reason
but
with
their
ordinary
self
is
rudely
shaken
in
offering
resistance
to
its
subverters
but
for
us
who
believe
in
right
reason
in
the
duty
and
possibility
of
extricating
and
elevating
our
best
self
in
the
progress
of
humanity
towards
perfection
for
us
the
framework
of
society
that
theatre
on
which
this
august
drama
has
to
unroll
itself
is
sacred
and
whoever
administers
it
and
however
we
may
seek
to
remove
them
from
the
tenure
of
administration
yet
while
they
administer
we
steadily
and
with
undivided
heart
support
them
in
repressing
anarchy
and
disorder
because
without
order
there
can
be
no
society
and
without
society
there
can
be
no
human
perfection
with
me
indeed
this
rule
of
conduct
is
hereditary
i
remember
my
father
in
one
of
his
unpublished
letters
written
more
than
forty
years
ago
when
the
political
and
social
state
of
the
country
was
gloomy
and
troubled
and
there
were
riots
in
many
places
goes
on
after
strongly
insisting
on
the
badness
and
foolishness
of
the
government
and
on
the
harm
and
dangerousness
of
our
feudal
and
aristocratical
constitution
of
society
and
ends
thus
as
for
rioting
the
old
roman
way
of
dealing
with
that
is
always
the
right
one
flog
the
rank
and
file
and
fling
the
ringleaders
from
the
tarpeian
rock
and
this
opinion
we
can
never
forsake
however
our
liberal
friends
may
think
a
little
rioting
and
what
they
call
popular
demonstrations
useful
sometimes
to
their
own
interests
and
to
the
interests
of
the
valuable
practical
operations
they
have
in
hand
and
however
they
may
preach
the
right
of
an
englishman
to
be
left
to
do
as
far
as
possible
what
he
likes
and
the
duty
of
his
government
to
indulge
him
and
connive
as
much
as
possible
and
abstain
from
all
harshness
of
repression
and
even
when
they
artfully
show
us
operations
which
are
undoubtedly
precious
such
as
the
abolition
of
the
and
ask
us
if
for
their
sake
foolish
and
obstinate
governments
may
not
wholesomely
be
frightened
by
a
little
disturbance
the
good
design
in
view
and
the
difficulty
of
overcoming
opposition
to
it
being
considered
still
we
say
no
and
that
monster
processions
in
the
streets
and
forcible
irruptions
into
the
parks
even
in
professed
support
of
this
good
design
ought
to
be
unflinchingly
forbidden
and
repressed
and
that
far
more
is
lost
than
is
gained
by
permitting
them
because
a
state
in
which
law
is
authoritative
and
sovereign
a
firm
and
settled
course
of
public
order
is
requisite
if
man
is
to
bring
to
maturity
anything
precious
and
lasting
now
or
to
found
anything
precious
and
lasting
for
the
future
thus
in
our
eyes
the
very
framework
and
exterior
order
of
the
state
whoever
may
administer
the
state
is
sacred
and
culture
is
the
most
resolute
enemy
of
anarchy
because
of
the
great
hopes
and
designs
for
the
state
which
culture
teaches
us
to
nourish
but
as
believing
in
right
reason
and
having
faith
in
the
progress
of
humanity
towards
perfection
and
ever
labouring
for
this
end
we
grow
to
have
clearer
sight
of
the
ideas
of
right
reason
and
of
the
elements
and
helps
of
perfection
and
come
gradually
to
fill
the
framework
of
the
state
with
them
to
fashion
its
internal
composition
and
all
its
laws
and
institutions
conformably
to
them
and
to
make
the
state
more
and
more
the
expression
as
we
say
of
our
best
self
which
is
not
manifold
and
vulgar
and
unstable
and
contentious
and
but
one
and
noble
and
secure
and
peaceful
and
the
same
for
all
mankind
with
what
aversion
shall
we
not
then
regard
anarchy
with
what
firmness
shall
we
not
check
it
when
there
is
so
much
that
is
so
precious
which
it
will
endanger
so
that
for
the
sake
of
the
present
but
far
more
for
the
sake
of
the
future
the
lovers
of
culture
are
unswervingly
and
with
a
good
conscience
the
opposers
of
anarchy
and
not
as
the
barbarians
and
philistines
whose
honesty
and
whose
sense
of
humour
make
them
shrink
as
we
have
seen
from
treating
the
state
as
too
serious
a
thing
and
from
giving
it
too
much
power
for
indeed
the
only
state
they
know
of
and
think
they
administer
is
the
expression
of
their
ordinary
self
and
though
the
headstrong
and
violent
extreme
among
them
might
gladly
arm
this
with
full
authority
yet
their
virtuous
mean
is
as
we
have
said
pricked
in
conscience
at
doing
this
and
so
our
barbarian
secretaries
of
state
let
the
park
railings
be
broken
down
and
our
philistine
let
the
london
roughs
rob
and
beat
the
bystanders
but
we
beholding
in
the
state
no
expression
of
our
ordinary
self
but
even
already
as
it
were
the
appointed
frame
and
prepared
vessel
of
our
best
self
and
for
the
future
our
best
self
powerful
beneficent
and
sacred
expression
and
organ
we
are
willing
and
resolved
even
now
to
strengthen
against
anarchy
the
trembling
hands
of
our
barbarian
home
secretaries
and
the
feeble
knees
of
our
philistine
and
to
tell
them
that
it
is
not
really
in
behalf
of
their
own
ordinary
self
that
they
are
called
to
protect
the
park
railings
and
to
suppress
the
london
roughs
but
in
behalf
of
the
best
self
both
of
themselves
and
of
all
of
us
in
the
future
nevertheless
though
for
resisting
anarchy
the
lovers
of
culture
may
prize
and
employ
fire
and
strength
yet
they
must
at
the
same
time
bear
constantly
in
mind
that
it
is
not
at
this
moment
true
what
the
majority
of
people
tell
us
that
the
world
wants
fire
and
strength
more
than
sweetness
and
light
and
that
things
are
for
the
most
part
to
be
settled
first
and
understood
afterwards
we
have
seen
how
much
of
our
present
perplexities
and
confusion
this
untrue
notion
of
the
majority
of
people
amongst
us
has
caused
and
tends
to
perpetuate
therefore
the
true
business
of
the
friends
of
culture
now
is
to
dissipate
this
false
notion
to
spread
the
belief
in
right
reason
and
in
a
firm
intelligible
law
of
things
and
to
get
men
to
allow
their
thought
and
consciousness
to
play
on
their
stock
notions
and
habits
disinterestedly
and
freely
to
get
men
to
try
in
preference
to
staunchly
acting
with
imperfect
knowledge
to
obtain
some
sounder
basis
of
knowledge
on
which
to
act
this
is
what
the
friends
and
lovers
of
culture
have
to
do
however
the
believers
in
action
may
grow
impatient
with
us
for
saying
so
and
may
insist
on
our
lending
a
hand
to
their
practical
operations
and
showing
a
commendable
interest
in
them
to
this
insistence
we
must
indeed
turn
a
deaf
ear
but
neither
on
the
other
hand
must
the
friends
of
culture
expect
to
take
the
believers
in
action
by
storm
or
to
be
visibly
and
speedily
important
and
to
rule
and
cut
a
figure
in
the
world
aristotle
says
that
those
for
whom
ideas
and
the
pursuit
of
the
intelligible
law
of
things
can
have
much
attraction
are
principally
the
young
filled
with
generous
spirit
and
with
a
passion
for
perfection
but
the
mass
of
mankind
he
says
follow
seeming
goods
for
real
bestowing
hardly
a
thought
upon
true
sweetness
and
light
and
to
their
lives
he
adds
mournfully
who
can
give
another
and
a
better
rhythm
but
although
those
chiefly
attracted
by
sweetness
and
light
will
probably
always
be
the
young
and
enthusiastic
and
culture
must
not
hope
to
take
the
mass
of
mankind
by
storm
yet
we
will
not
therefore
for
our
own
day
and
for
our
own
people
admit
and
rest
in
the
desponding
sentence
of
aristotle
for
is
not
this
the
right
crown
of
the
long
discipline
of
hebraism
and
the
due
fruit
of
mankind
centuries
of
painful
schooling
in
and
the
just
reward
above
all
of
the
strenuous
energy
of
our
own
nation
and
kindred
in
dealing
honestly
with
itself
and
walking
steadfastly
according
to
the
best
light
it
knows
that
when
in
the
fulness
of
time
it
has
reason
and
beauty
offered
to
it
and
the
law
of
things
as
they
really
are
it
should
at
last
walk
by
this
true
light
with
the
same
staunchness
and
zeal
with
which
it
formerly
walked
by
its
imperfect
light
and
thus
man
two
great
natural
forces
hebraism
and
hellenism
should
no
longer
be
dissociated
and
rival
but
should
be
a
joint
force
of
right
thinking
and
strong
doing
to
carry
him
on
towards
perfection
this
is
what
the
lovers
of
culture
may
perhaps
dare
to
augur
for
such
a
nation
as
ours
therefore
however
great
the
changes
to
be
accomplished
and
however
dense
the
array
of
barbarians
philistines
and
populace
we
will
neither
despair
on
the
one
hand
nor
on
the
other
threaten
violent
revolution
and
change
but
we
will
look
forward
cheerfully
and
hopefully
to
a
revolution
as
the
duke
of
wellington
said
by
due
course
of
law
though
not
exactly
such
laws
as
our
liberal
friends
are
now
with
their
actual
lights
fond
of
offering
us
but
if
despondency
and
violence
are
both
of
them
forbidden
to
the
believer
in
culture
yet
neither
on
the
other
hand
is
public
life
and
direct
political
action
much
permitted
to
him
for
it
is
his
business
as
we
have
seen
to
get
the
present
believers
in
action
and
lovers
of
political
talking
and
doing
to
make
a
return
upon
their
own
minds
scrutinise
their
stock
notions
and
habits
much
more
value
their
present
talking
and
doing
much
less
in
order
that
by
learning
to
think
more
clearly
they
may
come
at
last
to
act
less
confusedly
but
how
shall
we
persuade
our
barbarian
to
hold
lightly
to
his
feudal
usages
how
shall
we
persuade
our
nonconformist
that
his
time
spent
in
agitating
for
the
abolition
of
would
have
been
better
spent
in
getting
worthier
ideas
than
churchmen
have
of
god
and
the
ordering
of
the
world
or
his
time
spent
in
battling
for
voluntaryism
in
education
better
spent
in
learning
to
value
and
found
a
public
and
national

how
shall
we
persuade
finally
our
not
to
be
content
with
sitting
in
the
hall
of
judgment
or
marching
at
the
head
of
his
men
of
war
without
some
knowledge
how
to
perform
judgment
and
how
to
direct
men
of
war
how
i
say
shall
we
persuade
all
these
of
this
if
our
sees
that
we
want
to
get
his
and
his
scales
of
justice
for
our
own
hands
or
the
nonconformist
that
we
want
for
ourselves
his
platform
or
the
barbarian
that
we
want
for
ourselves
his
eminency
and
function
certainly
they
will
be
less
slow
to
believe
as
we
want
them
to
believe
that
the
intelligible
law
of
things
has
in
itself
something
desirable
and
precious
and
that
all
place
function
and
bustle
are
hollow
goods
without
it
if
they
see
that
we
can
content
ourselves
with
it
and
find
in
it
our
satisfaction
without
making
it
an
instrument
to
give
us
for
ourselves
place
function
and
bustle
and
although
sidgwick
says
that
social
usefulness
really
means
losing
oneself
in
a
mass
of
disagreeable
hard
mechanical
details
and
though
all
the
believers
in
action
are
fond
of
asserting
the
same
thing
yet
as
to
lose
ourselves
is
not
what
we
want
but
to
find
the
intelligible
law
of
things
this
assertion
too
we
shall
not
blindly
accept
but
shall
sift
and
try
it
a
little
first
and
if
we
see
that
because
the
believers
in
action
forgetting
goethe
maxim
to
act
is
easy
to
think
is
hard
imagine
there
is
some
wonderful
virtue
in
losing
oneself
in
a
mass
of
mechanical
details
therefore
they
excuse
themselves
from
much
thought
about
the
clear
ideas
which
ought
to
govern
these
details
then
we
shall
give
our
chief
care
and
pains
to
seeking
out
those
ideas
and
to
setting
them
forth
being
persuaded
that
if
we
have
the
ideas
firm
and
clear
the
mechanical
details
for
their
execution
will
come
a
great
deal
more
simply
and
easily
than
we
now
suppose
and
even
in
education
where
our
liberal
friends
are
now
with
much
zeal
bringing
out
their
train
of
practical
operations
and
inviting
all
men
to
lend
them
a
hand
and
where
since
education
is
the
road
to
culture
we
might
gladly
lend
them
a
hand
with
their
practical
operations
if
we
could
lend
them
one
anywhere
yet
if
we
see
that
any
german
or
swiss
or
french
law
for
education
rests
on
very
clear
ideas
about
the
citizen
claim
in
this
matter
upon
the
state
and
the
state
duty
towards
the
citizen
but
has
its
mechanical
details
comparatively
few
and
simple
while
an
english
law
for
the
same
concern
is
ruled
by
no
clear
idea
about
the
claim
and
the
state
duty
but
has
in
compensation
a
mass
of
minute
mechanical
details
about
the
number
of
members
on
a
committee
and
how
many
shall
be
a
quorum
and
how
they
shall
be
summoned
and
how
often
they
shall
meet
then
we
must
conclude
that
our
nation
stands
in
more
need
of
clear
ideas
on
the
main
matter
than
of
laboured
details
about
the
accessories
of
the
matter
and
that
we
do
more
service
by
trying
to
help
it
to
the
ideas
than
by
lending
it
a
hand
with
the
details
so
while
samuel
morley
and
his
friends
talk
of
changing
their
policy
on
education
not
for
the
sake
of
modelling
it
on
more
sound
ideas
but
for
fear
the
management
of
education
should
be
taken
out
of
their
hands
we
shall
not
much
care
for
taking
the
management
out
of
their
hands
and
getting
it
into
ours
but
rather
we
shall
try
and
make
them
perceive
that
to
model
education
on
sound
ideas
is
of
more
importance
than
to
have
the
management
of
it
in
one
own
hands
ever
so
fully
at
this
exciting
juncture
then
while
so
many
of
the
lovers
of
new
ideas
somewhat
weary
as
we
too
are
of
the
stock
performances
of
our
liberal
friends
upon
the
political
stage
are
disposed
to
rush
valiantly
upon
this
public
stage
themselves
we
can
not
at
all
think
that
for
a
wise
lover
of
new
ideas
this
stage
is
the
right
one
plenty
of
people
there
will
be
without
us
country
gentlemen
in
search
of
a
club
demagogues
in
search
of
a
tub
lawyers
in
search
of
a
place
industrialists
in
search
of
gentility
who
will
come
from
the
east
and
from
the
west
and
will
sit
down
at
that
thyesteän
banquet
of
which
english
public
life
for
these
many
years
past
has
been
because
so
long
as
those
old
organisations
of
which
we
have
seen
the
insufficiency
those
expressions
of
our
ordinary
self
barbarian
or
philistine
have
force
anywhere
they
will
have
force
in
parliament
there
the
man
whom
the
barbarians
send
can
not
but
be
impelled
to
please
the
barbarians
ordinary
self
and
their
natural
taste
for
the
bathos
and
the
man
whom
the
philistines
send
can
not
but
be
impelled
to
please
those
of
the
philistines
parliamentary
conservatism
will
and
must
long
mean
this
that
the
barbarians
should
keep
their
heritage
and
parliamentary
liberalism
that
the
barbarians
should
pass
away
as
they
will
pass
away
and
that
into
their
heritage
the
philistines
should
enter
this
seems
indeed
to
be
the
true
and
authentic
promise
of
which
our
liberal
friends
and
mr
bright
believe
themselves
the
heirs
and
the
goal
of
that
great
man
labours
presently
perhaps
odger
and
bradlaugh
will
be
there
with
their
mission
to
oust
both
barbarians
and
philistines
and
to
get
the
heritage
for
the
populace
we
on
the
other
hand
are
for
giving
the
heritage
neither
to
the
barbarians
nor
to
the
philistines
nor
yet
to
the
populace
but
we
are
for
the
transformation
of
each
and
all
of
these
according
to
the
law
of
perfection
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
our
nation
a
sense
vague
and
obscure
as
yet
of
weariness
with
the
old
organisations
of
desire
for
this
transformation
works
and
grows
in
the
house
of
commons
the
old
organisations
must
inevitably
be
most
enduring
and
strongest
the
transformation
must
inevitably
be
longest
in
showing
itself
and
it
may
truly
be
averred
therefore
that
at
the
present
juncture
the
centre
of
movement
is
not
in
the
house
of
commons
it
is
in
the
fermenting
mind
of
the
nation
and
his
is
for
the
next
twenty
years
the
real
influence
who
can
address
himself
to
this
pericles
was
perhaps
the
most
perfect
public
speaker
who
ever
lived
for
he
was
the
man
who
most
perfectly
combined
thought
and
wisdom
with
feeling
and
eloquence
yet
plato
brings
in
alcibiades
declaring
that
men
went
away
from
the
oratory
of
pericles
saying
it
was
very
fine
it
was
very
good
and
afterwards
thinking
no
more
about
it
but
they
went
away
from
hearing
socrates
talk
he
says
with
the
point
of
what
he
had
said
sticking
fast
in
their
minds
and
they
could
not
get
rid
of
it
socrates
is
poisoned
and
dead
but
in
his
own
breast
does
not
every
man
carry
about
with
him
a
possible
socrates
in
that
power
of
a
disinterested
play
of
consciousness
upon
his
stock
notions
and
habits
of
which
this
wise
and
admirable
man
gave
all
through
his
lifetime
the
great
example
and
which
was
the
secret
of
his
incomparable
influence
and
he
who
leads
men
to
call
forth
and
exercise
in
themselves
this
power
and
who
busily
calls
it
forth
and
exercises
it
in
himself
is
at
the
present
moment
perhaps
as
socrates
was
in
his
time
more
in
concert
with
the
vital
working
of
men
minds
and
more
effectually
significant
than
any
house
of
commons
orator
or
practical
operator
in
politics
every
one
is
now
boasting
of
what
he
has
done
to
educate
men
minds
and
to
give
things
the
course
they
are
taking

we
indeed
pretend
to
educate
no
one
for
we
are
still
engaged
in
trying
to
clear
and
educate
ourselves
but
we
are
sure
that
the
endeavour
to
reach
through
culture
the
firm
intelligible
law
of
things
we
are
sure
that
the
detaching
ourselves
from
our
stock
notions
and
habits
that
a
more
free
play
of
consciousness
an
increased
desire
for
sweetness
and
light
and
all
the
bent
which
we
call
hellenising
is
the
now
of
the
life
of
our
nation
and
of
humanity
somewhat
obscurely
perhaps
for
this
moment
but
decisively
for
the
immediate
future
and
that
those
who
work
for
this
are
the
sovereign
educators
docile
echoes
of
the
eternal
voice
pliant
organs
of
the
infinite
will
they
are
going
along
with
the
essential
movement
of
the
world
and
this
is
their
strength
and
their
happy
and
divine
fortune
for
if
the
believers
in
action
who
are
so
impatient
with
us
and
call
us
effeminate
had
had
the
same
fortune
they
would
no
doubt
have
surpassed
us
in
this
sphere
of
vital
influence
by
all
the
superiority
of
their
genius
and
energy
over
ours
but
now
we
go
the
way
the
world
is
going
while
they
abolish
the

by
the
power
of
