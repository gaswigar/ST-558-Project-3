introductory
essay
don
miguel
de
unamuno
i
sat
several
years
ago
at
the
welsh
national
eisteddfod
under
the
vast
tent
in
which
the
bard
of
wales
was
being
crowned
after
the
small
golden
crown
had
been
placed
in
unsteady
equilibrium
on
the
head
of
a
pressman
several
welsh
bards
came
on
the
platform
and
recited
little
epigrams
a
welsh
bard
is
if
young
a
pressman
and
if
of
maturer
years
a
divine
in
this
case
as
england
was
at
war
they
were
all
of
the
maturer
kind
and
while
i
listened
to
the
music
of
their
ditties
the
sense
thereof
being
alas
beyond
my
reach
i
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
all
of
them
though
different
closely
resembled
don
miguel
de
unamuno
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
enter
into
the
of
racial
disquisitions
if
there
is
a
race
in
the
world
over
which
more
sense
and
more
nonsense
can
be
freely
said
for
lack
of
definite
information
than
the
welsh
it
is
surely
this
ancient
basque
people
whose
greatest
contemporary
figure
is
perhaps
don
miguel
de
unamuno
i
am
merely
setting
down
that
intuitional
fact
for
what
it
may
be
worth
though
i
do
not
hide
my
opinion
that
such
promptings
of
the
inner
untutored
man
are
worth
more
than
cavefuls
of
bones
and
tombfuls
of
undecipherable
papers
this
reminiscence
moreover
which
springs
up
into
the
light
of
my
memory
every
time
i
think
of
don
miguel
de
unamuno
has
to
my
mind
a
further
value
in
that
in
it
the
image
of
don
miguel
does
not
appear
as
evoked
by
one
man
but
by
many
though
many
of
one
species
many
who
in
depth
are
but
one
man
one
type
the
welsh
divine
now
this
unity
underlying
a
multiplicity
these
many
faces
moods
and
movements
traceable
to
one
only
type
i
find
deeply
connected
in
my
mind
with
unamuno
person
and
with
what
he
signifies
in
spanish
life
and
letters
and
when
i
further
delve
into
my
impression
i
first
realize
an
undoubtedly
physical
relation
between
the
welsh
divines
and
the
unamuno
a
tall
bony
man
with
high
cheeks
a
nose
pointed
grey
beard
and
a
complexion
the
colour
of
the
red
hematites
on
which
bilbao
his
native
town
is
built
and
which
bilbao
ruthlessly
plucks
from
its
very
body
to
exchange
for
gold
in
the
markets
of
england
and
in
the
deep
sockets
under
the
high
aggressive
forehead
prolonged
by
short
hair
two
eyes
like
gimlets
eagerly
watching
the
world
through
spectacles
which
seem
to
be
purposely
pointed
at
the
object
like
microscopes
a
fighting
expression
but
of
noble
fighting
above
the
prizes
of
the
passing
world
the
contempt
for
which
is
shown
in
a
peculiar
attire
whose
blackness
invades
even
that
little
triangle
of
white
which
worldly
men
leave
on
their
breast
for
the
necktie
of
frivolity
and
the
decorations
of
vanity
and
blinding
it
leaves
but
the
thinnest
rim
of
white
collar
to
emphasize
rather
than
relieve
the
priestly
effect
of
the
whole
such
is
don
miguel
de
unamuno
such
is
rather
his
photograph
for
unamuno
himself
is
ever
changing
a
talker
as
all
good
spaniards
are
nowadays
but
a
talker
in
earnest
and
with
his
heart
in
it
he
is
varied
like
the
subjects
of
his
conversation
and
still
more
like
the
passions
which
they
awake
in
him
and
here
i
find
an
unsought
reason
in
intellectual
support
of
that
intuitional
observation
which
i
noted
down
in
starting
that
unamuno
resembles
the
welsh
in
that
he
is
not
ashamed
of
showing
his
passions
a
thing
which
he
has
often
to
do
for
he
is
very
much
alive
and
feels
therefore
plenty
of
them
but
a
word
of
caution
may
here
be
necessary
since
that
term
passion
having
been
diminished
that
is
made
meaner
by
the
world
an
erroneous
impression
might
be
conveyed
by
what
precedes
of
the
life
and
ways
of
unamuno
so
that
it
may
not
be
superfluous
to
say
that
don
miguel
de
unamuno
is
a
professor
of
greek
in
the
university
of
salamanca
an
of
it
who
left
behind
the
reputation
of
being
a
strong
ruler
a
father
of
a
numerous
family
and
a
man
who
has
sung
the
quiet
and
deep
joys
of
married
life
with
a
restraint
a
vigour
and
a
nobility
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
match
in
any
literature
a
passionate
man
or
as
he
would
perhaps
prefer
to
say
a
passionate
man
but
in
a
major
not
in
a
minor
key
of
strong
not
of
weak
passions
the
difference
between
the
two
lies
perhaps
in
that
the
man
with
strong
passions
lives
them
while
the
man
with
weak
passions
is
lived
by
them
so
that
while
weak
passions
paralyze
the
will
strong
passions
urge
man
to
action
it
is
such
an
urge
towards
life
such
a
vitality
ever
awake
which
inspires
unamuno
multifarious
activities
in
the
realm
of
the
mind
the
duties
of
his
chair
of
greek
are
the
first
claim
upon
his
time
but
then
his
reading
is
prodigious
as
any
reader
of
this
book
will
realize
for
himself
not
only
is
he
familiar
with
the
of
every
intellectual
worker
the
biblical
greek
roman
and
italian
cultures
but
there
is
hardly
anything
worth
reading
in
europe
and
america
which
he
has
not
read
and
but
for
the
slav
languages
in
the
original
though
never
out
of
spain
and
seldom
out
of
salamanca
he
has
succeeded
in
establishing
direct
connections
with
most
of
the
intellectual
leaders
of
the
world
and
in
gathering
an
astonishingly
accurate
knowledge
of
the
spirit
and
literature
of
foreign
peoples
it
was
in
his
library
at
salamanca
that
he
once
explained
to
an
englishman
the
meaning
of
a
particular
scotticism
in
robert
burns
and
it
was
there
that
he
congratulated
another
englishman
on
his
having
read
the
he
said
of
the
man
of
letters
who
is
no
mere
man
of
letters
but
also
a
man
from
that
corner
of
castile
he
has
poured
out
his
spirit
in
essays
poetry
criticism
novels
philosophy
lectures
and
public
meetings
and
that
daily
toil
of
press
article
writing
which
is
the
duty
rather
than
the
privilege
of
most
writers
in
spain
such
are
the
many
faces
moods
and
movements
in
which
unamuno
appears
before
spain
and
the
world
and
yet
despite
this
multiplicity
and
this
dispersion
the
dominant
impression
which
his
personality
leaves
behind
is
that
of
a
vigorous
unity
an
unswerving
concentration
both
of
mind
and
purpose
bagaria
the
national
caricaturist
a
genius
of
rhythm
and
character
which
the
war
revealed
but
who
was
too
good
not
to
be
overshadowed
by
the
facile
art
of
raemaekers
imagine
goya
overshadowed
by
reynolds
once
represented
unamuno
as
an
owl
a
marvellous
thrust
at
the
heart
of
character
for
all
this
vitality
and
activity
of
mind
is
shot
through
by
the
absolute
immobility
of
two
owlish
eyes
piercing
the
darkness
of
spiritual
night
and
this
intense
gaze
into
the
mystery
is
the
steel
axis
round
which
his
spirit
revolves
and
revolves
in
desperation
the
unity
under
his
multiplicity
the
one
fire
under
his
passions
and
the
inspiration
of
his
whole
work
and
life
it
was
unamuno
himself
who
once
said
that
the
basque
is
the
alkaloid
of
the
spaniard
the
saying
is
true
so
far
as
it
goes
but
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
one
of
the
two
alkaloids
it
is
probable
that
if
the
spanish
character
were
analyzed
always
provided
that
the
mediterranean
aspect
of
it
be
left
aside
as
a
thing
apart
two
main
principles
would
be
recognized
in
it
the
basque
richer
in
concentration
substance
strength
and
the
andalusian
more
given
to
observation
grace
form
the
two
types
are
to
this
day
socially
opposed
the
andalusian
is
a
people
which
has
lived
down
many
civilizations
and
in
which
even
illiterate
peasants
possess
a
kind
of
innate
education
the
basques
are
a
primitive
people
of
mountaineers
and
fishermen
in
which
even
scholars
have
a
roughness
not
unlike
the
roughness
of
scotch
tweeds
or
character
it
is
the
even
balancing
of
these
two
elements
the
force
of
the
northerner
with
the
grace
of
the
southerner
which
gives
the
castilian
his
admirable
poise
and
explains
the
graceful
virility
of
men
such
as
fray
luis
de
león
and
the
feminine
strength
of
women
such
as
queen
isabel
and
santa
teresa
we
are
therefore
led
to
expect
in
so
forcible
a
representative
of
the
basque
race
as
unamuno
the
more
substantial
and
earnest
features
of
the
spanish
spirit
our
expectation
is
not
disappointed
and
to
begin
with
it
appears
in
that
very
concentration
of
his
mind
and
soul
on
the
mystery
of
destiny
on
earth
unamuno
is
in
earnest
in
dead
earnest
as
to
this
matter
this
earnestness
is
a
distinct
spanish
nay
basque
feature
in
him
there
is
something
of
the
stern
attitude
of
loyola
about
his
tragic
sense
of
life
and
on
this
subject
under
one
form
or
another
his
only
subject
he
admits
no
joke
no
flippancy
no
subterfuge
a
true
heir
of
those
great
spanish
saints
and
mystics
whose
lifework
was
devoted
to
the
exploration
of
the
kingdoms
of
faith
he
is
more
human
than
they
in
that
he
has
lost
hold
of
the
firm
ground
where
they
had
stuck
their
anchor
yet
though
loose
in
the
modern
world
he
refuses
to
be
drawn
away
from
the
main
business
of
the
christian
the
saving
of
his
soul
which
in
his
interpretation
means
the
conquest
of
his
immortality
his
own
immortality
an
individualist
certainly
and
he
proudly
claims
the
title
nothing
more
refreshing
in
these
days
of
hoggish
communistic
cant
than
this
great
voice
asserting
the
divine
the
eternal
rights
of
the
individual
but
it
is
not
with
political
rights
that
he
is
concerned
political
individualism
when
not
a
mere
blind
for
the
unlimited
freedom
of
civil
privateering
is
but
the
outcome
of
that
abstract
idea
of
man
which
he
so
energetically
condemns
as
pedantic
that
is
inhuman
his
opposition
of
the
individual
to
society
is
not
that
of
a
puerile
anarchist
to
a
no
less
puerile
socialist
there
is
nothing
childish
about
unamuno
his
assertion
that
society
is
for
the
individual
not
the
individual
for
society
is
made
on
a
transcendental
plane
it
is
not
the
argument
of
liberty
against
authority
which
can
be
easily
answered
on
the
rationalistic
plane
by
showing
that
authority
is
in
its
turn
the
liberty
of
the
social
or
collective
being
a
higher
more
complex
and
individual
than
the
individual
pure
and
simple
it
is
rather
the
unanswerable
argument
of
eternity
against
duration
now
that
argument
must
rest
on
a
religious
basis
and
it
is
on
a
religious
basis
that
unamuno
founds
his
individualism
hence
the
true
spanish
flavour
of
his
social
theory
which
will
not
allow
itself
to
be
set
down
and
analyzed
into
principles
of
ethics
and
politics
with
their
inevitable
tendency
to
degenerate
into
mere
economics
but
remains
free
and
fluid
and
absolute
like
the
spirit
such
an
individualism
has
therefore
none
of
the
features
of
that
childish
which
inspires
most
anarchists
it
is
on
the
contrary
based
on
high
thinking
the
highest
of
all
that
which
refuses
to
dwell
on
anything
less
than
man
origin
and
destination
we
are
here
confronted
with
that
humanistic
tendency
of
the
spanish
mind
which
can
be
observed
as
the
dominant
feature
of
her
arts
and
literature
all
races
are
of
course
predominantly
concerned
with
man
but
they
all
manifest
their
concern
with
a
difference
man
is
in
spain
a
concrete
being
the
man
of
flesh
and
bones
and
the
whole
man
he
is
neither
subtilized
into
an
idea
by
pure
thinking
nor
civilized
into
a
gentleman
by
social
laws
and
prejudices
spanish
art
and
letters
deal
with
concrete
tangible
persons
now
there
is
no
more
concrete
no
more
tangible
person
for
every
one
of
us
than
ourself
unamuno
is
therefore
right
in
the
line
of
spanish
tradition
in
dealing
predominantly
one
might
almost
say
always
with
his
own
person
the
feeling
of
the
awareness
of
one
own
personality
has
seldom
been
more
forcibly
expressed
than
by
unamuno
this
is
primarily
due
to
the
fact
that
he
is
himself
obsessed
by
it
but
in
his
expression
of
it
unamuno
derives
also
some
strength
from
his
own
sense
of
matter
and
the
material
again
a
typically
spanish
element
of
his
character
thus
his
human
beings
are
as
much
body
as
soul
or
rather
body
and
soul
all
in
one
a
union
which
he
admirably
renders
by
bold
mixtures
of
physical
and
spiritual
metaphors
as
in
uno
la
carne
del
to
enjoy
the
flesh
of
one
own
soul
in
fact
unamuno
as
a
true
spaniard
which
he
is
refuses
to
surrender
life
to
ideas
and
that
is
why
he
runs
shy
of
abstractions
in
which
he
sees
but
shrouds
wherewith
we
cover
dead
thoughts
he
is
solely
concerned
with
his
own
life
nothing
but
his
life
and
the
whole
of
his
life
an
egotistical
position
perhaps
unamuno
however
can
and
does
answer
the
charge
we
can
only
know
and
feel
humanity
in
the
one
human
being
which
we
have
at
hand
it
is
by
penetrating
deep
into
ourselves
that
we
find
our
brothers
in
us
branches
of
the
same
trunk
which
can
only
touch
each
other
by
seeking
their
common
origin
this
searching
within
unamuno
has
undertaken
with
a
sincerity
a
fearlessness
which
can
not
be
excelled
nowhere
will
the
reader
find
the
inner
contradictions
of
a
modern
human
being
who
is
at
the
same
time
healthy
and
capable
of
thought
set
down
with
a
greater
respect
for
truth
here
the
uncompromising
tendency
of
the
spanish
race
whose
eyes
never
turn
away
from
nature
however
unwelcome
the
sight
is
strengthened
by
that
passion
for
life
which
burns
in
unamuno
the
suppression
of
the
slightest
thought
or
feeling
for
the
sake
of
intellectual
order
would
appear
to
him
as
a
despicable
worldly
trick
thus
it
is
precisely
because
he
does
sincerely
feel
a
passionate
love
of
his
own
life
that
he
thinks
out
with
such
scrupulous
accuracy
every
argument
which
he
finds
in
his
mind
his
own
mind
a
part
of
his
life
against
the
possibility
of
life
after
death
but
it
is
also
because
he
feels
that
despite
such
conclusive
arguments
his
will
to
live
perseveres
that
he
refuses
to
his
intellect
the
power
to
kill
his
faith
a
of
the
spirit
as
he
himself
calls
the
spanish
mystics
he
starts
for
his
adventures
after
having
like
hernán
cortés
burnt
his
ships
but
is
it
necessary
to
enhance
his
figure
by
literary
comparison
he
is
what
he
wants
to
be
a
man
in
the
striking
expression
which
he
chose
as
a
title
for
one
of
his
short
stories
less
than
a
whole
not
a
mere
thinking
machine
set
to
prove
a
theory
nor
an
actor
on
the
world
stage
singing
a
poem
well
built
at
the
price
of
many
a
compromise
but
a
whole
man
with
all
his
affirmations
and
all
his
negations
all
the
pitiless
thoughts
of
a
penetrating
mind
that
denies
and
all
the
desperate
of
a
soul
that
yearns
for
eternal
life
this
strife
between
enemy
truths
the
truth
thought
and
the
truth
felt
or
as
he
himself
puts
it
between
veracity
and
sincerity
is
and
it
is
because
the
sense
of
is
the
most
direct
expression
of
it
that
this
book
is
his
masterpiece
the
conflict
is
here
seen
as
reflected
in
the
person
of
the
author
the
book
opens
by
a
definition
of
the
spanish
man
the
man
of
flesh
and
bones
illustrated
by
the
consideration
of
the
real
living
men
who
stood
behind
the
bookish
figures
of
great
philosophers
and
consciously
or
unconsciously
shaped
and
misshaped
their
doctrines
in
order
to
satisfy
their
own
vital
yearnings
this
is
followed
by
the
statement
of
the
will
to
live
or
hunger
for
immortality
in
the
course
of
which
the
usual
subterfuges
with
which
this
issue
is
evaded
in
philosophy
theology
or
mystic
literature
are
exposed
and
the
real
concrete
flesh
and
bones
character
of
the
immortality
which
men
desire
is
reaffirmed
the
catholic
position
is
then
explained
as
the
attitude
in
the
matter
summed
up
in
tertullian
quia
and
this
is
opposed
to
the
critical
attitude
which
denies
the
possibility
of
individual
survival
in
the
sense
previously
defined
thus
unamuno
leads
us
to
his
inner
deadlock
his
reason
can
rise
no
higher
than
scepticism
and
unable
to
become
vital
dies
sterile
his
faith
exacting
affirmations
and
unable
therefore
to
be
apprehended
by
the
logical
mind
remains
incommunicable
from
the
bottom
of
this
abyss
unamuno
builds
up
his
theory
of
life
but
is
it
a
theory
unamuno
does
not
claim
for
it
such
an
intellectual
dignity
he
knows
too
well
that
in
the
constructive
part
of
his
book
his
vital
self
takes
the
leading
part
and
repeatedly
warns
his
reader
of
the
fact
lest
critical
objections
might
be
raised
against
this
or
that
assumption
or
it
is
on
the
survival
of
his
will
to
live
after
all
the
onslaughts
of
his
critical
intellect
that
he
finds
the
basis
for
his
belief
or
rather
for
his
effort
to
believe
leads
to
and
this
founded
as
it
is
on
a
universal
conflict
widens
into
love
of
all
that
lives
and
therefore
wants
to
survive
so
by
an
act
of
love
springing
from
our
own
hunger
for
immortality
we
are
led
to
give
a
conscience
to
the
universe
that
is
to
create
god
such
is
the
process
by
which
unamuno
from
the
transcendental
pessimism
of
his
inner
contradiction
extracts
an
everyday
optimism
founded
on
love
his
symbol
of
this
attitude
is
the
figure
of
don
quixote
of
whom
he
truly
says
that
his
creed
can
hardly
be
called
idealism
since
he
did
not
fight
for
ideas
it
was
spiritualism
for
he
fought
for
the
spirit
thus
he
opposes
a
synthetical
to
an
analytical
attitude
a
religious
to
an
ideal
spain
his
spain
the
spiritual
manifestation
of
the
spanish
race
to
europe
his
europe
the
intellectual
manifestation
of
the
white
race
which
he
sees
in
and
heroic
love
even
when
comically
unpractical
to
culture
which
in
this
book
written
in
is
already
prophetically
spelt
kultura
this
courageous
work
is
written
in
a
style
which
is
the
man
for
buffon
saying
seldom
true
applies
here
to
the
letter
it
is
written
as
carlyle
wrote
not
merely
with
the
brain
but
with
the
whole
soul
and
the
whole
body
of
the
man
and
in
such
a
vivid
manner
that
one
can
without
much
effort
imagine
the
eager
gesticulation
which
now
and
then
underlines
interprets
despises
argues
denies
and
above
all
asserts
in
his
absolute
subservience
to
the
matter
in
hand
this
manner
of
writing
has
its
great
precedent
in
santa
teresa
the
differences
and
they
are
considerable
are
not
of
art
absent
in
either
case
but
of
nature
they
are
such
deep
and
obvious
differences
as
obtain
between
the
devout
ignorant
graceful
nun
of
avila
and
the
learned
wilful
professor
of
salamanca
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
the
language
is
the
most
direct
and
simple
required
it
is
also
the
least
literary
and
the
most
popular
unamuno
who
lives
in
close
touch
with
the
people
has
enriched
the
spanish
literary
language
by
returning
to
it
many
a
popular
term
his
vocabulary
abounds
in
racy
words
of
the
soil
and
his
writings
gain
from
them
an
almost
pith
and
directness
which
suits
his
own
basque
primitive
nature
his
expression
occurs
simultaneously
with
the
thoughts
and
feelings
to
be
expressed
the
flow
of
which
but
loosely
controlled
by
the
critical
mind
often
breaks
through
the
meshes
of
established
diction
and
gives
birth
to
new
forms
created
under
the
pressure
of
the
moment
this
feature
unamuno
has
also
in
common
with
santa
teresa
but
what
in
the
saint
was
a
charm
becomes
in
unamuno
a
deliberate
manner
inspired
partly
by
an
acute
sense
of
the
symbolical
and
psychological
value
of
partly
by
that
genuine
need
for
expansion
of
the
language
which
all
true
original
thinkers
or
feelers
must
experience
but
partly
also
by
an
acquired
habit
of
juggling
with
words
which
is
but
natural
in
a
philologist
endowed
with
a
vigorous
imagination
unamuno
revels
in
words
he
positively
enjoys
stretching
them
beyond
their
usual
meaning
twisting
them
composing
opposing
and
transposing
them
in
all
sorts
of
possible
ways
this
game
not
wholly
unrewarded
now
and
then
by
striking
intellectual
finds
seems
to
be
the
only
relaxation
which
he
allows
his
usually
austere
mind
it
certainly
is
the
only
light
feature
of
a
style
the
merit
of
which
lies
in
its
being
the
expression
of
a
great
mind
earnestly
concentrated
on
a
great
idea
the
earnestness
the
intensity
and
the
oneness
of
his
predominant
passion
are
the
main
cause
of
the
strength
of
unamuno
philosophic
work
they
remain
his
main
asset
yet
become
also
the
principal
cause
of
his
weakness
as
a
creative
artist
great
art
can
only
flourish
in
the
temperate
zone
of
the
passions
on
the
return
journey
from
the
torrid
unamuno
as
a
creator
has
none
of
the
failings
of
those
artists
who
have
never
felt
deeply
but
he
does
show
the
limitations
of
those
artists
who
can
not
cool
down
and
the
most
striking
of
them
is
that
at
bottom
he
is
seldom
able
to
put
himself
in
a
purely
esthetical
mood
in
this
as
in
many
other
features
unamuno
curiously
resembles
wordsworth
whom
by
the
way
he
is
one
of
the
few
spaniards
to
read
and
appreciate
like
him
unamuno
is
an
essentially
purposeful
and
utilitarian
mind
of
the
two
qualities
which
the
work
of
art
requires
for
its
inception
earnestness
and
detachment
both
unamuno
and
wordsworth
possess
the
first
both
are
deficient
in
the
second
their
interest
in
their
respective
leading
thought
survival
in
the
first
virtue
in
the
second
is
too
direct
too
pressing
to
allow
them
the
distance
necessary
for
artistic
work
both
are
urged
to
work
by
a
lofty
utilitarianism
the
search
for
god
through
the
individual
soul
in
unamuno
the
search
for
god
through
the
social
soul
in
wordsworth
so
that
their
thoughts
and
sensations
are
polarized
and
their
spirit
loses
that
impartial
transparence
for
nature
lights
without
which
no
great
art
is
possible
once
suggested
this
parallel
is
too
rich
in
sidelights
to
be
lightly
dropped
this
which
distinguishes
them
explains
that
both
should
have
consciously
or
unconsciously
chosen
a
life
of
for
unamuno
lives
in
salamanca
very
much
as
wordsworth
lived
in
the
lake
district
in
a
still
retreat
sheltered
but
not
to
social
duties
lost
hence
in
both
a
certain
proclivity
towards
ploughing
a
solitary
furrow
and
becoming
there
are
no
doubt
important
differences
the
englishman
sense
of
nature
is
both
keener
and
more
concrete
while
the
spaniard
knowledge
of
human
nature
is
not
barred
by
the
subtle
inhibitions
and
innate
limitations
which
tend
to
blind
its
more
unpleasant
aspects
to
the
eye
of
the
englishman
there
is
more
courage
and
passion
in
the
spaniard
more
harmony
and
goodwill
in
the
englishman
the
one
is
more
like
fire
the
other
like
light
for
wordsworth
a
poem
is
above
all
an
essay
a
means
for
conveying
a
lesson
in
forcible
and
easily
remembered
terms
to
those
who
are
in
need
of
improvement
for
unamuno
a
poem
or
a
novel
and
he
holds
that
a
novel
is
but
a
poem
is
the
outpouring
of
a
man
passion
the
overflow
of
the
heart
which
can
not
help
itself
and
lets
go
and
it
may
be
that
the
essential
difference
between
the
two
is
to
be
found
in
this
difference
between
their
respective
purposes
unamuno
purpose
is
more
intimately
personal
and
individual
wordsworth
is
more
social
and
objective
thus
both
miss
the
temperate
zone
where
emotion
takes
shape
into
the
moulds
of
art
but
while
wordsworth
is
driven
by
his
ideal
of
social
service
this
side
of
it
into
the
cold
light
of
both
moral
and
intellectual
unamuno
remains
beyond
where
the
molten
metal
is
too
near
the
fire
of
passion
and
can
not
cool
down
into
shape
unamuno
is
therefore
not
unlike
wordsworth
in
the
insufficiency
of
his
sense
of
form
we
have
just
seen
the
essential
cause
of
this
insufficiency
to
lie
in
the
nonesthetical
attitude
of
his
mind
and
we
have
tried
to
show
one
of
the
roots
of
such
an
attitude
in
the
very
loftiness
and
earnestness
of
his
purpose
yet
there
are
others
for
living
nature
is
as
it
is
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
a
certain
refractoriness
to
form
is
a
typical
feature
of
the
basque
character
the
sense
of
form
is
closely
in
sympathy
with
the
feminine
element
in
human
nature
and
the
basque
race
is
strongly
masculine
the
predominance
of
the
masculine
element
strength
without
grace
is
as
typical
of
unamuno
as
it
is
of
wordsworth
the
literary
gifts
which
might
for
the
sake
of
synthesis
be
symbolized
in
a
smile
are
absent
in
both
there
is
as
little
humour
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
humour
however
sometimes
occurs
in
unamuno
but
only
in
his
moments
and
then
with
a
curious
bite
of
its
own
which
adds
an
unconscious
element
to
its
comic
effect
grace
only
visits
them
in
moments
of
inspiration
and
then
it
is
of
a
noble
character
enhanced
as
it
is
by
the
gift
of
strength
and
as
for
the
sense
for
rhythm
and
music
both
unamuno
and
wordsworth
seem
to
be
limited
to
the
most
vigorous
and
masculine
gaits
this
feature
is
particularly
pronounced
in
unamuno
for
while
wordsworth
is
painstaking
and
too
good
a
teacher
to
underestimate
the
importance
of
pleasure
in
man
progress
unamuno
knows
no
compromise
his
aim
is
not
to
please
but
to
strike
and
he
deliberately
seeks
the
naked
the
forceful
even
the
brutal
word
for
truth
there
is
in
him
however
a
cause
of
formlessness
from
which
wordsworth
is
free
namely
an
eagerness
for
sincerity
and
veracity
which
brushes
aside
all
preparation
ordering
or
planning
of
ideas
as
suspect
of
dishing
up
intellectual
trickery
and
juggling
with
spontaneous
truths
such
qualities
both
the
positive
and
the
negative
are
apparent
in
his
poetry
in
it
the
appeal
of
force
and
sincerity
is
usually
stronger
than
that
of
art
this
is
particularly
the
case
in
his
first
volume
in
which
a
lofty
inspiration
a
noble
attitude
of
mind
a
rich
and
racy
vocabulary
a
keen
insight
into
the
spirit
of
places
and
above
all
the
overflowing
vitality
of
a
strong
man
in
the
force
of
ripeness
contend
against
the
still
awkward
gait
of
the
basque
and
a
certain
rebelliousness
of
rhyme
the
dough
of
the
poetic
language
is
here
seen
heavily
pounded
by
a
powerful
hand
bent
on
reducing
its
angularities
and
on
improving
its
plasticity
nor
do
we
need
to
wait
for
further
works
in
order
to
enjoy
the
reward
of
such
efforts
for
it
is
attained
in
this
very
volume
more
than
once
as
for
instance
in
en
el
mar
el
ave
que
voló
del
a
beautiful
poem
in
which
emotion
and
thought
are
happily
blended
into
exquisite
form
in
his
last
poem
cristo
de
unamuno
undertakes
the
task
of
giving
a
poetical
rendering
of
his
tragic
sense
of
life
in
the
form
of
a
meditation
on
the
christ
of
velázquez
the
beautiful
and
pathetic
picture
in
the
prado
why
velázquez
and
not
christ
himself
the
fact
is
that
though
in
his
references
to
actual
forms
unamuno
closely
follows
velázquez
picture
the
spiritual
interpretation
of
it
which
he
develops
as
the
poem
unfolds
itself
is
wholly
personal
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
two
great
spaniards
wider
apart
than
unamuno
and
velázquez
for
if
unamuno
is
the
very
incarnation
of
the
masculine
spirit
of
the
north
all
strength
and
substance
velázquez
is
the
image
of
the
feminine
spirit
of
the
south
all
grace
and
form
velázquez
is
a
limpid
mirror
with
a
human
depth
yet
a
mirror
that
unamuno
has
departed
from
the
image
of
christ
which
the
great
sevillian
reflected
on
his
immortal
canvas
was
therefore
to
be
expected
but
then
unamuno
has
while
speaking
of
don
quixote
whom
he
has
also
freely
and
personally
interpreted
taken
great
care
to
point
out
that
a
work
of
art
is
for
each
of
us
all
that
we
see
in
it
and
moreover
unamuno
has
not
so
much
departed
from
velázquez
image
of
christ
as
delved
into
its
depths
expanded
enlarged
it
or
if
you
prefer
seen
in
its
limpid
surface
the
immense
figure
of
his
own
inner
christ
however
free
and
unorthodox
in
its
wide
scope
of
images
and
ideas
the
poem
is
in
its
form
a
regular
meditation
in
the
manner
approved
by
the
catholic
church
and
it
is
therefore
meet
that
it
should
rise
from
a
concrete
tangible
object
as
it
is
recommended
to
the
faithful
to
this
concrete
character
of
its
origin
the
poem
owes
much
of
its
suggestiveness
as
witness
the
following
passage
quoted
here
with
a
translation
sadly
unworthy
of
the
original
as
being
the
clearest
link
between
the
poetical
meditation
and
the
main
thought
that
underlies
all
the
work
and
the
life
of
unamuno
nube
negra
o
es
que
una
nube
negra
de
los
cielos
ese
negror
le
dió
a
tu
cabellera
de
nazareno
cual
de
mustio
sauce
de
una
noche
sin
luna
sobre
el
río
la
sombra
del
ala
sin
perfiles
del
ángel
de
la
nada
negadora
de
luzbel
que
en
su
caída
inacabable
fondo
no
puede
dar
su
eterna
cuita
clava
en
tu
frente
en
tu
razón
vela
el
claro
verbo
en
ti
con
esa
nube
negra
cual
de
luzbel
las
negras

mientras
brilla
el

desnudo
con
tu
desnudo

black
cloud
or
was
it
then
that
a
black
cloud
from
heaven
such
blackness
gave
to
your
nazarene
hair
as
of
a
languid
willow
the
river
brooding
in
moonless
night
is
it
the
shadow
of
the
profileless
wing
of
luzbel
the
angel
of
denying
nothingness
endlessly
falling
bottom
he
can
touch
whose
grief
eternal
he
nails
on
to
thy
forehead
to
thy
reason
is
the
clear
word
in
thee
with
that
cloud
veiled
a
cloud
as
black
as
the
black
wings
of
luzbel
while
love
shines
naked
within
thy
naked
breast
the
poem
despite
its
length
easily
maintains
this
lofty
level
throughout
and
if
he
had
written
nothing
else
unamuno
would
still
remain
as
having
given
to
spanish
letters
the
noblest
and
most
sustained
lyrical
flight
in
the
language
it
abounds
in
passages
of
ample
beauty
and
often
strikes
a
note
of
primitive
strength
in
the
true
old
testament
style
it
is
most
distinctively
a
poem
in
a
major
key
in
a
group
with
and
but
in
a
tone
halfway
between
the
two
and
as
coming
from
the
most
and
substantial
poet
that
spain
ever
had
wholly
free
from
that
tendency
towards
grandiloquence
and
ciceronian
drapery
which
blighted
previous
similar
efforts
in
spain
its
weakness
lies
in
a
certain
monotony
due
to
the
interplay
of
unamuno
two
main
limitations
as
an
artist
the
absolute
surrender
to
one
dominant
thought
and
a
certain
deficiency
of
form
bordering
here
on
contempt
the
plan
is
but
a
loose
sequence
of
meditations
on
successive
aspects
of
christ
as
suggested
by
images
or
advocations
of
his
divine
person
or
even
of
parts
of
his
human
body
lion
bull
lily
sword
crown
head
knees
each
meditation
is
treated
in
a
period
of
blank
verse
usually
of
a
beautiful
texture
the
splendour
of
which
is
due
less
to
actual
images
than
to
the
inner
vigour
of
ideas
and
the
eagerness
with
which
even
the
simplest
facts
are
interpreted
into
significant
symbols
yet
sometimes
this
blank
verse
becomes
hard
and
stony
under
the
stubborn
hammering
of
a
too
insistent
mind
and
the
device
of
ending
each
meditation
with
a
line
accented
on
its
last
syllable
tends
but
to
increase
the
monotony
of
the
whole
blank
verse
is
never
the
best
medium
for
poets
of
a
strong
masculine
inspiration
for
it
does
not
sufficiently
correct
their
usual
deficiency
in
form
such
poets
are
usually
at
their
best
when
they
bind
themselves
to
the
discipline
of
existing
forms
and
particularly
when
they
limit
the
movements
of
their
muse
to
the
sonnet
scanty
plot
of
ground
unamuno
best
poetry
as
wordsworth
is
in
his
sonnets
his

sonetos

in

some
of
the
finest
sonnets
in
the
spanish
language
there
is
variety
in
this
volume
more
at
least
than
is
usual
in
unamuno
from
comments
on

of
local

which
savour
of
the
more
prosaic
side
of
wordsworth
to
meditations
on
space
and
time
such
as
that
sonnet
so
reminiscent
of
shelley
of
from
a
suggestive
homily
to
a
don
juan
of
ideas
whose
thirst
for
knowledge
is
not
love
of
truth
but
intellectual
lust
and
whose

is
therefore

exquisitely
rendered

sonnet
the
author
main
theme
itself
which
of
course
occupies
a
prominent
part
in
the
series
appears
treated
under
many
different
lights
and
in
genuinely
poetical
moods
which
truly
do
justice
to
the
inherent
wealth
of
poetical
inspiration
which
it
contains
many
a
sonnet
might
be
quoted
here
and
in
particular
that
sombre
and
fateful
poem
novum
sub
cxxiii
which
defeats
its
own
theme
by
the
striking
originality
of
its
inspiration
so
active
so
positive
is
the
inspiration
of
this
poetry
that
the
question
of
outside
influences
does
not
even
arise
unamuno
is
probably
the
spanish
contemporary
poet
whose
manner
owes
least
if
anything
at
all
to
modern
developments
of
poetry
such
as
those
which
take
their
source
in
baudelaire
and
verlaine
these
and
artists
have
no
doubt
enriched
the
sensuous
the
formal
the
sentimental
even
the
intellectual
aspects
of
verse
with
an
admirable
variety
of
exquisite
shades
lacking
which
most
poetry
seems
to
the
fastidious
palate
of
modern
men
unamuno
is
too
genuine
a
representative
of
the
spiritual
and
masculine
variety
of
spanish
genius
ever
impervious
to
french
and
generally
to
intellectual
influences
to
be
affected
by
the
esthetic
excellence
of
this
art
yet
for
all
his
disregard
of
the
modern
resources
which
it
adds
to
the
poetic
craft
unamuno
loses
none
of
his
modernity
he
is
indeed
more
than
modern
when
as
he
often
does
he
strikes
the
true
poetic
note
he
is
outside
time
his
appeal
is
not
in
complexity
but
in
strength
he
is
not
refined
he
is
final
in
the
preface
to
his
novelas
ejemplares
y
un
unamuno
says
novelist
that
is
poet
a
novel
that
is
a
poem
thus
with
characteristic
decision
he
sides
with
the
lyrical
conception
of
the
novel
there
is
of
course
an
infinite
variety
of
types
of
novels
but
they
can
probably
all
be
reduced
to
two
classes
the
dramatic
or
objective
and
the
lyrical
or
subjective
according
to
the
mood
or
inspiration
which
predominates
in
them
the
present
trend
of
the
world
points
towards
the
dramatic
or
objective
type
this
type
is
more
in
tune
with
the
detached
and
scientific
character
of
the
age
the
novel
is
often
nowadays
considered
as
a
document
a
slice
of
life
a
piece
of
information
a
literary
photograph
representing
places
and
people
which
purse
or
time
prevents
us
from
seeing
with
our
own
eyes
it
is
obvious
given
what
we
now
know
of
him
that
such
a
view
of
the
novel
can
not
appeal
to
unamuno
he
is
a
utilitarian
but
not
of
worldly
utilities
his
utilitarianism
transcends
our
daily
wants
and
seeks
to
provide
for
our
eternal
ones
he
is
moreover
a
mind
whose
workings
turn
in
spiral
form
towards
a
central
idea
and
therefore
feels
an
instinctive
antagonism
to
the
dispersive
habits
of
thought
and
sensation
which
such
detailed
observation
of
life
usually
entails
for
at
bottom
the
opposition
between
the
lyrical
and
the
dramatic
novel
may
be
reduced
to
that
between
the
poet
and
the
dramatist
both
the
dramatist
and
the
poet
create
in
order
to
link
up
their
soul
and
the
world
in
one
complete
circle
of
experience
but
this
circle
is
travelled
in
opposite
directions
the
poet
goes
inwards
first
then
out
to
nature
full
of
his
inner
experience
and
back
home
the
dramatist
goes
outwards
first
then
comes
back
to
himself
his
harvest
of
wisdom
gathered
in
reality
it
is
the
recognition
of
his
own
lyrical
nature
which
makes
unamuno
pronounce
the
identity
of
the
novel
and
the
poem
whatever
we
may
think
of
it
as
a
general
theory
there
is
little
doubt
that
this
opinion
is
in
the
main
sound
in
so
far
as
it
refers
to
unamuno
own
work
his
novels
are
created
within
they
are
and
their
author
is
the
first
to
declare
it
so
novels
which
happen
in
the
kingdom
of
the
spirit
outward
points
of
reference
in
time
and
space
are
sparingly
given
in
fact
reduced
to
a
bare
minimum
in
some
of
them
as
for
instance
the
name
of
the
town
in
which
the
action
takes
place
is
not
given
and
such
scanty
references
to
the
topography
and
general
features
as
are
supplied
would
equally
apply
to
any
other
provincial
town
of
spain
action
in
the
current
sense
of
the
word
is
correspondingly
simplified
since
the
material
and
local
elements
on
which
it
usually
exerts
itself
are
schematized
and
in
their
turn
made
as
it
were
spiritual
thus
a
street
a
river
of
colour
for
some
for
others
a
series
of
accurately
described
shops
and
dwellings
becomes
in
unamuno
see
a
loom
where
the
passions
and
desires
of
men
and
women
cross
and
recross
each
other
and
weave
the
cloth
of
daily
life
even
the
physical
description
of
characters
is
reduced
to
a
standard
of
utmost
simplicity
so
that
in
fine
unamuno
novels
by
eliminating
all
other
material
appear
if
the
boldness
of
the
metaphor
be
permitted
as
the
spiritual
skeletons
of
novels
conflicts
between
souls
nor
is
this
the
last
stage
in
his
deepening
and
narrowing
of
the
creative
furrow
for
these
souls
are
in
their
turn
concentrated
so
that
the
whole
of
their
vitality
burns
into
one
passion
if
a
somewhat
fanciful
comparison
from
another
art
may
throw
any
light
on
this
feature
of
his
work
we
might
say
that
his
characters
are
to
those
of
galdós
for
instance
as
counterpoint
music
to
the
complex
modern
symphony
joaquín
monegro
the
true
hero
of
his
is
the
personification
of
hatred
raquel
in
and
catalina
in
marqués
de
are
two
widely
different
but
vigorous
almost
barbarous
maternities
alejandro
the
hero
of
his
powerful
menos
que
todo
un
is
masculine
will
pure
and
unconquerable
save
by
death
further
still
in
most
if
not
all
of
his
main
characters
we
can
trace
the
dominant
passion
which
is
their
whole
being
to
a
mere
variety
of
the
one
and
only
passion
which
obsesses
unamuno
himself
the
hunger
for
life
a
full
life
here
and
after
here
is
for
instance
a
sombre
study
of
hatred
a
modern
paraphrase
of
the
story
of
cain
joaquín
monegro
the
cain
of
the
novel
has
been
reading
byron
poem
and
writes
in
his
diary
it
was
when
i
read
how
lucifer
declared
to
cain
that
he
cain
was
immortal
that
i
began
in
terror
to
wonder
whether
i
also
was
immortal
and
whether
in
me
would
be
also
immortal
my
hatred
i
a
soul
i
said
to
myself
then
this
my
hatred
soul
and
i
came
to
think
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise
that
such
a
hatred
can
not
be
the
function
of
a
body
a
corruptible
organism
could
not
hate
as
i
hated
thus
joaquín
monegro
like
every
other
main
character
in
his
work
appears
preoccupied
by
the
same
central
preoccupation
of
unamuno
in
one
word
all
unamuno
characters
are
but
incarnations
of
himself
but
that
is
what
we
expected
to
find
in
a
lyrical
novelist
there
are
critics
who
conclude
from
this
observation
that
these
characters
do
not
exist
that
they
are
mere
arguments
on
legs
personified
ideas
here
and
there
in
unamuno
novels
there
are
passages
which
lend
some
colour
of
plausibility
to
this
view
yet
it
is
in
my
opinion
mistaken
unamuno
characters
may
be
schematized
stripped
of
their
complexities
reduced
to
the
mainspring
of
their
nature
they
may
moreover
reveal
mainsprings
made
of
the
same
steel
but
that
they
are
alive
no
one
could
deny
who
has
a
sense
for
life
the
very
restraint
in
the
use
of
physical
details
which
unamuno
has
made
a
feature
of
his
creative
work
may
have
led
his
critics
to
forget
the
intensity
of
those
admirably
chosen
which
are
given
it
is
significant
that
the
eyes
play
an
important
part
in
his
description
of
characters
and
in
his
narrative
too
his
sense
of
the
interpenetration
of
body
and
soul
is
so
deep
that
he
does
not
for
one
moment
let
us
forget
how
bodily
his
souls
are
and
how
pregnant
with
spiritual
significance
is
every
one
of
their
words
and
gestures
no
these
characters
are
not
arguments
on
legs
they
truly
are
men
and
women
of
flesh
and
bones
human
terribly
human
in
thus
emphasizing
a
particular
feature
in
their
nature
unamuno
imparts
to
his
creations
a
certain
deformity
which
savours
of
romantic
days
yet
unamuno
is
not
a
romanticist
mainly
because
romanticism
was
an
esthetic
attitude
and
his
attitude
is
seldom
purely
esthetic
for
all
their
show
of
passion
true
romanticists
seldom
gave
their
real
selves
to
their
art
they
created
a
stage
double
of
their
own
selves
for
public
exhibitions
they
sought
the
picturesque
their
form
was
lyrical
but
their
substance
was
dramatic
unamuno
on
the
contrary
even
though
he
often
seeks
expression
in
dramatic
form
is
essentially
lyrical
and
if
he
is
always
intense
he
never
is
exuberant
he
follows
the
spanish
tradition
for
restraint
for
there
is
one
along
its
opposite
tradition
for
grandiloquence
and
true
to
the
spirit
of
it
he
seeks
the
maximum
of
effect
through
the
minimum
of
means
then
he
never
shouts
here
is
an
example
of
his
quiet
method
the
rhythmical
beauty
of
which
is
unfortunately
almost
untranslatable
y
así
pasaron
días
de
llanto
y
de
negrura
hasta
que
las
lágrimas
fueron
yéndose
hacia
adentro
y
la
casa

derritiendo
los

and
thus
days
of
weeping
and
mourning
went
by
till
the
tears
began
to
flow
inward
and
the
blackness
to
melt
in
the
home
miguel
de
unamuno
is
the
greatest
literary
figure
of
spain
baroja
may
surpass
him
in
variety
of
external
experience
azorín

delicate
art
ortega
y
gasset
in
philosophical
subtlety
ayala
in
intellectual
elegance
valle
inclán
in
rhythmical
grace
even
in
vitality
he
may
have
to
yield
the
first
place
to
that
athlete
of
literature
blasco
ibáñez
but
unamuno
is
head
and
shoulders
above
them
all
in
the
highness
of
his
purpose
and
in
the
earnestness
and
loyalty
with
which
he
has
served
all
through
his
life
his
unattainable
dulcinea
then
there
is
another
and
most
important
reason
which
explains
his
position
as
first
of
spanish
letters
and
it
is
that
unamuno
by
the
cross
which
he
has
chosen
to
bear
incarnates
the
spirit
of
modern
spain
his
eternal
conflict
between
faith
and
reason
between
life
and
thought
between
spirit
and
intellect
between
heaven
and
civilization
is
the
conflict
of
spain
herself
a
border
country
like
russia
in
which
east
and
west
mix
their
spiritual
waters
spain
wavers
between
two
and
can
not
rest
in
russia
this
conflict
emerges
in
literature
during
the
nineteenth
century
when
dostoievsky
and
tolstoy
stand
for
the
east
while
turgeniev
becomes
the
west
advocate
in
spain
a
country
less
articulate
and
moreover
a
country
in
which
the
blending
of
east
and
west
is
more
intimate
for
both
found
a
common
solvent
in
centuries
of
latin
civilization
the
conflict
is
less
clear
less
on
the
surface
ortega
y
gasset
is
our
turgeniev
not
without
mixture
unamuno
is
our
dostoievsky
but
painfully
aware
of
the
strength
of
the
other
side
within
him
and
full
of
misgivings
nor
is
it
sure
that
when
we
speak
of
east
in
this
connection
we
really
mean
east
there
is
a
third
country
in
europe
in
which
the
eastern
view
is
as
forcibly
put
and
as
deeply
understood
as
the
western
a
third
border
country
england
england
particularly
in
those
of
her
racial
elements
conventionally
named
celtic
is
closely
in
sympathy
with
the
east
ireland
is
almost
purely
eastern
in
this
respect
that
is
perhaps
why
unamuno
feels
so
strong
an
attraction
for
the
english
language
and
its
literature

i
intended
at

to

to
this

of

sentimiento

which
has
been
undertaken
by
my
friend
crawford
flitch
but
upon
further
consideration
i
have
abandoned
the
idea
for
i
reflected
that
after
all
i
wrote
this
book
not
for
spaniards
only
but
for
all
civilized
and
christian
men
christian
in
particular
whether
consciously
so
or
not
of
whatever
country
they
may
be
furthermore
if
i
were
to
set
about
writing
an
introduction
in
the
light
of
all
that
we
see
and
feel
now
after
the
great
war
and
still
more
of
what
we
foresee
and
forefeel
i
should
be
led
into
writing
yet
another
book
and
that
is
a
thing
to
be
done
with
deliberation
and
only
after
having
better
digested
this
terrible
peace
which
is
nothing
else
but
the
war
painful
convalescence
as
for
many
years
my
spirit
has
been
nourished
upon
the
very
core
of
english
literature
evidence
of
which
the
reader
may
discover
in
the
following
pages
the
translator
in
putting
my
into
english
has
merely
converted
not
a
few
of
the
thoughts
and
feelings
therein
expressed
back
into
their
original
form
of
expression
or
retranslated
them
perhaps
whereby
they
emerge
other
than
they
originally
were
for
an
idea
does
not
pass
from
one
language
to
another
without
change
the
fact
that
this
english
translation
has
been
carefully
revised
here
in
my
house
in
this
ancient
city
of
salamanca
by
the
translator
and
myself
implies
not
merely
some
guarantee
of
exactitude
but
also
something
more
namely
a
correction
in
certain
respects
of
the
original
the
truth
is
that
being
an
incorrigible
spaniard
i
am
naturally
given
to
a
kind
of
extemporization
and
to
neglectfulness
of
a
filed
niceness
in
my
works
for
this
reason
my
original
work
and
likewise
the
italian
and
french
translations
of
it
issued
from
the
press
with
a
certain
number
of
errors
obscurities
and
faulty
references
the
labour
which
my
friend
crawford
flitch
fortunately
imposed
upon
me
in
making
me
revise
his
translation
obliged
me
to
correct
these
errors
to
clarify
some
obscurities
and
to
give
greater
exactitude
to
certain
quotations
from
foreign
writers
hence
this
english
translation
of
my
presents
in
some
ways
a
more
purged
and
correct
text
than
that
of
the
original
spanish
this
perhaps
compensates
for
what
it
may
lose
in
the
spontaneity
of
my
spanish
thought
which
at
times
i
believe
is
scarcely
translatable
it
would
advantage
me
greatly
if
this
translation
in
opening
up
to
me
a
public
of
readers
should
some
day
lead
to
my
writing
something
addressed
to
and
concerned
with
this
public
for
just
as
a
new
friend
enriches
our
spirit
not
so
much
by
what
he
gives
us
of
himself
as
by
what
he
causes
us
to
discover
in
our
own
selves
something
which
if
we
had
never
known
him
would
have
lain
in
us
undeveloped
so
it
is
with
a
new
public
perhaps
there
may
be
regions
in
my
own
spanish
spirit
my
basque
spirit
and
therefore
doubly
spanish
unexplored
by
myself
some
corner
hitherto
uncultivated
which
i
should
have
to
cultivate
in
order
to
offer
the
flowers
and
fruits
of
it
to
the
peoples
of
english
speech
and
now
no
more
god
give
my
english
readers
that
inextinguishable
thirst
for
truth
which
i
desire
for
myself

at

whether
certain
philosophers
like
it
or
not
in
most
of
the
histories
of
philosophy
that
i
know
philosophic
systems
are
presented
to
us
as
if
growing
out
of

spontaneously
and
their

the

appear
only
as
mere
pretexts
the

of
the

of
the

who
philosophized
occupies
a
secondary
place
and
yet
it
is
precisely
this
inner
biography
that
explains
for
us
most
things
it
behoves
us
to
say
before
all
that
philosophy
lies
closer
to
poetry
than
to
science
all
philosophic
systems
which
have
been
constructed
as
a
supreme
concord
of
the
final
results
of
the
individual
sciences
have
in
every
age
possessed
much
less
consistency
and
life
than
those
which
expressed
the
integral
spiritual
yearning
of
their
authors
and
though
they
concern
us
so
greatly
and
are
indeed
indispensable
for
our
life
and
thought
the
sciences
are
in
a
certain
sense
more
foreign
to
us
than
philosophy
they
fulfil
a
more
objective
end
that
is
to
say
an
end
more
external
to
ourselves
they
are
fundamentally
a
matter
of
economics
a
new
scientific
discovery
of
the
kind
called
theoretical
is
like
a
mechanical
discovery
that
of
the
the
telephone
the
phonograph
or
the
aeroplane
a
thing
which
is
useful
for
something
else
thus
the
telephone
may
be
useful
to
us
in
enabling
us
to
communicate
at
a
distance
with
the
woman
we
love
but
she
wherefore
is
she
useful
to
us
a
man

an
electric
tram

go
to
hear
an
opera
and
asks
himself
which
in
this
case
is
the
more
useful
the
tram
or
the
opera
philosophy
answers
to
our
need
of
forming
a
complete
and
unitary
conception
of
the
world
and
of
life
and
as
a
result
of
this
conception
a
feeling
which
gives
birth
to
an
inward
attitude
and
even
to
outward
action
but
the
fact
is
that
this
feeling
instead
of
being
a
consequence
of
this
conception
is
the
cause
of
it
our
philosophy
that
is
our
mode
of
understanding
or
not
understanding
the
world
and
life
springs
from
our
feeling
towards
life
itself
and
life
like
everything
affective
has
roots
in
subconsciousness
perhaps
in
unconsciousness
it
is
not
usually
our
ideas
that
make
us
optimists
or
pessimists
but
it
is
our
optimism
or
our
pessimism
of
physiological
or
perhaps
pathological
origin
as
much
the
one
as
the
other
that
makes
our
ideas
man
is
said
to
be
a
reasoning
animal
i
do
not
know
why
he
has
not
been
defined
as
an
affective
or
feeling
animal
perhaps
that
which
differentiates
him
from
other
animals
is
feeling
rather
than
reason
more
often
i
have
seen
a
cat
reason
than
laugh
or
weep
perhaps
it
weeps
or
laughs
inwardly
but
then
perhaps
also
inwardly
the
crab
resolves
equations
of
the
second
degree
and
thus
in
a
philosopher
what
must
needs
most
concern
us
is
the
man
take
kant
the
man
immanuel
kant
who
was
born
and
lived
at
königsberg
in
the
latter
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
in
the
philosophy
of
this
man
kant
a
man
of
heart
and
head
that
is
to
say
a
man
there
is
a
significant
somersault
as
kierkegaard
another
man
and
what
a
man
would
have
said
the
somersault
from
the
of
pure
to
the
of
practical
he
reconstructs
in
the
latter
what
he
destroyed
in
the
former
in
spite
of
what
those
may
say
who
do
not
see
the
man
himself
after
having
examined
and
pulverized
with
his
analysis
the
traditional
proofs
of
the
existence
of
god
of
the
aristotelian
god
who
is
the
god
corresponding
to
the
the
abstract
god
the
unmoved
prime
mover
he
reconstructs
god
anew
but
the
god
of
the
conscience
the
author
of
the
moral
order
the
lutheran
god
in
short
this
transition
of
kant
exists
already
in
embryo
in
the
lutheran
notion
of
faith
the
first
god
the
rational
god
is
the
projection
to
the
outward
infinite
of
man
as
he
is
by
definition
that
is
to
say
of
the
abstract
man
of
the
man
the
other
god
the
god
of
feeling
and
volition
is
the
projection
to
the
inward
infinite
of
man
as
he
is
by
life
of
the
concrete
man
the
man
of
flesh
and
bone
kant
reconstructed
with
the
heart
that
which
with
the
head
he
had
overthrown
and
we
know
from
the
testimony
of
those
who
knew
him
and
from
his
testimony
in
his
letters
and
private
declarations
that
the
man
kant
the
more
or
less
selfish
old
bachelor
who
professed
philosophy
at
königsberg
at
the
end
of
the
century
of
the
encyclopedia
and
the
goddess
of
reason
was
a
man
much
preoccupied
with
the
problem
i
mean
with
the
only
real
vital
problem
the
problem
that
strikes
at
the
very
root
of
our
being
the
problem
of
our
individual
and
personal
destiny
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
man
kant
was
not
resigned
to
die
utterly
and
because
he
was
not
resigned
to
die
utterly
he
made
that
leap
that
immortal
somersault
from
the
one
critique
to
the
other
whosoever
reads
the
of
practical
carefully
and
without
blinkers
will
see
that
in
strict
fact
the
existence
of
god
is
therein
deduced
from
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
not
the
immortality
of
the
soul
from
the
existence
of
god
the
categorical
imperative
leads
us
to
a
moral
postulate
which
necessitates
in
its
turn
in
the
teleological
or
rather
eschatological
order
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
in
order
to
sustain
this
immortality
god
is
introduced
all
the
rest
is
the
jugglery
of
the
professional
of
philosophy
the
man
kant
felt
that
morality
was
the
basis
of
eschatology
but
the
professor
of
philosophy
inverted
the
terms
another
professor
the
professor
and
man
william
james
has
somewhere
said
that
for
the
generality
of
men
god
is
the
provider
of
immortality
yes
for
the
generality
of
men
including
the
man
kant
the
man
james
and
the
man
who
writes
these
lines
which
you
reader
are
reading
talking
to
a
peasant
one
day
i
proposed
to
him
the
hypothesis
that
there
might
indeed
be
a
god
who
governs
heaven
and
earth
a
consciousness
of
the
universe
but
that
for
all
that
the
soul
of
every
man
may
not
be
immortal
in
the
traditional
and
concrete
sense
he
replied
then
wherefore
god
so
answered
in
the
secret
tribunal
of
their
consciousness
the
man
kant
and
the
man
james
only
in
their
capacity
as
professors
they
were
compelled
to
justify
rationally
an
attitude
in
itself
so
little
rational
which
does
not
mean
of
course
that
the
attitude
is
absurd
hegel
made
famous
his
aphorism
that
all
the
rational
is
real
and
all
the
real
rational
but
there
are
many
of
us
who
unconvinced
by
hegel
continue
to
believe
that
the
real
the
really
real
is
irrational
that
reason
builds
upon
irrationalities
hegel
a
great
framer
of
definitions
attempted
with
definitions
to
reconstruct
the
universe
like
that
artillery
sergeant
who
said
that
cannon
were
made
by
taking
a
hole
and
enclosing
it
with
steel
another
man
the
man
joseph
butler
the
anglican
bishop
who
lived
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
whom
cardinal
newman
declared
to
be
the
greatest
man
in
the
anglican
church
wrote
at
the
conclusion
of
the
first
chapter
of
his
great
work
analogy
of
the
chapter
which
treats
of
a
future
life
these
pregnant
words
this
credibility
of
a
future
life
which
has
been
here
insisted
upon
how
little
soever
it
may
satisfy
our
curiosity
seems
to
answer
all
the
purposes
of
religion
in
like
manner
as
a
demonstrative
proof
would
indeed
a
proof
even
a
demonstrative
one
of
a
future
life
would
not
be
a
proof
of
religion
for
that
we
are
to
live
hereafter
is
just
as
reconcilable
with
the
scheme
of
atheism
and
as
well
to
be
accounted
for
by
it
as
that
we
are
now
alive
is
and
therefore
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
than
to
argue
from
that
scheme
that
there
can
be
no
future
state
the
man
butler
whose
works
were
perhaps
known
to
the
man
kant
wished
to
save
the
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
with
this
object
he
made
it
independent
of
belief
in
god
the
first
chapter
of
his
treats
as
i
have
said
of
the
future
life
and
the
second
of
the
government
of
god
by
rewards
and
punishments
and
the
fact
is
that
fundamentally
the
good
anglican
bishop
deduces
the
existence
of
god
from
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
as
this
deduction
was
the
good
anglican
bishop
he
had
not
to
make
that
somersault
which
at
the
close
of
the
same
century
the
good
lutheran
philosopher
had
to
make
butler
the
bishop
was
one
man
and
kant
the
professor
another
man
to
be
a
man
is
to
be
something
concrete
unitary
and
substantive
it
is
to
be
a
thing
now
we
know
what
another
man
the
man
benedict
spinoza
that
portuguese
jew
who
was
born
and
lived
in
holland
in
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
wrote
about
the
nature
of

that
is
to

to
him

is

that
which
is

and

and
in
the

he
adds

that
is
the

man
kant
and
of
every
man
who
is
a
man
is
nothing
but
the
endeavour
the
effort
which
he
makes
to
continue
to
be
a
man
not
to
die
and
the
other
proposition
which
follows
these
two
the
eighth
says
quo
unaquoeque
res
in
suo
esse
perseverare
conatur
nullum
tempus
finitum
sed
indefinitum
that
is
the
endeavour
whereby
each
individual
thing
endeavours
to
persist
involves
no
finite
time
but
indefinite
time
that
is
to
say
that
you
i
and
spinoza
wish
never
to
die
and
that
this
longing
of
ours
never
to
die
is
our
actual
essence
nevertheless
this
poor
portuguese
jew
exiled
in
the
mists
of
holland
could
never
attain
to
believing
in
his
own
personal
immortality
and
all
his
philosophy
was
but
a
consolation
which
he
contrived
for
his
lack
of
faith
just
as
other
men
have
a
pain
in
hand
or
foot
or
so
he
had
unhappy
man
and
unhappy
and
man
this
thing
is
he
a
thing
how
absurd
soever
the
question
may
appear
there
are
some
who
have
propounded
it
not
long
ago
there
went
abroad
a
certain
doctrine
called
positivism
which
did
much
good
and
much
and
among
other
ills
that
it
wrought
was
the
introduction
of
a
method
of
analysis
whereby
facts
were
pulverized
reduced
to
a
dust
of
facts
most
of
the
facts
labelled
as
such
by
positivism
were
really
only
fragments
of
facts
in
psychology
its
action
was
harmful
there
were
even
scholastics
meddling
in
literature
i
will
not
say
philosophers
meddling
in
poetry
because
poet
and
philosopher
are
twin
brothers
if
not
even
one
and
the
same
who
carried
this
positivist
psychological
analysis
into
the
novel
and
the
drama
where
the
main
business
is
to
give
act
and
motion
to
concrete
men
men
of
flesh
and
bone
and
by
dint
of
studying
states
of
consciousness
consciousness
itself
disappeared
the
same
thing
happened
to
them
which
is
said
often
to
happen
in
the
examination
and
testing
of
certain
complicated
organic
living
chemical
compounds
when
the
reagents
destroy
the
very
body
which
it
was
proposed
to
examine
and
all
that
is
obtained
is
the
products
of
its
decomposition
taking
as
their
the
evident
fact
that
contradictory
states
pass
through
our
consciousness
they
did
not
succeed
in
envisaging
consciousness
itself
the
i
to
ask
a
man
about
his
i
is
like
asking
him
about
his
body
and
note
that
in
speaking
of
the
i
i
speak
of
the
concrete
and
personal
i
not
of
the
i
of
fichte
but
of
fichte
himself
the
man
fichte
that
which
determines
a
man
that
which
makes
him
one
man
one
and
not
another
the
man
he
is
and
not
the
man
he
is
not
is
a
principle
of
unity
and
a
principle
of
continuity
a
principle
of
unity
firstly
in
space
thanks
to
the
body
and
next
in
action
and
intention
when
we
walk
one
foot
does
not
go
forward
and
the
other
backward
nor
when
we
look
if
we
are
normal
does
one
eye
look
towards
the
north
and
the
other
towards
the
south
in
each
moment
of
our
life
we
entertain
some
purpose
and
to
this
purpose
the
synergy
of
our
actions
is
directed
notwithstanding
the
next
moment
we
may
change
our
purpose
and
in
a
certain
sense
a
man
is
so
much
the
more
a
man
the
more
unitary
his
action
some
there
are
who
throughout
their
whole
life
follow
but
one
single
purpose
be
it
what
it
may
also
a
principle
of
continuity
in
time
without
entering
upon
a
discussion
an
unprofitable
discussion
as
to
whether
i
am
or
am
not
he
who
i
was
twenty
years
ago
it
appears
to
me
to
be
indisputable
that
he
who
i
am
derives
by
a
continuous
series
of
states
of
consciousness
from
him
who
was
in
my
body
twenty
years
ago
memory
is
the
basis
of
individual
personality
just
as
tradition
is
the
basis
of
the
collective
personality
of
a
people
we
live
in
memory
and
by
memory
and
our
spiritual
life
is
at
bottom
simply
the
effort
of
our
memory
to
persist
to
transform
itself
into
hope
the
effort
of
our
past
to
transform
itself
into
our
future
all
this
i
know
well
is
sheer
platitude
but
in
going
about
in
the
world
one
meets
men
who
seem
to
have
no
feeling
of
their
own
personality
one
of
my
best
friends
with
whom
i
have
walked
and
talked
every
day
for
many
years
whenever
i
spoke
to
him
of
this
sense
of
own
personality
used
to
say
but
i
have
no
sense
of
myself
i
know
what
that
is
on
a
certain
occasion
this
friend
remarked
to
me
i
should
like
to
be
naming
someone
and
i
said
that
is
what
i
shall
never
be
able
to
understand
that
one
should
want
to
be
someone
else
to
want
to
be
someone
else
is
to
want
to
cease
to
be
he
who
one
is
i
understand
that
one
should
wish
to
have
what
someone
else
has
his
wealth
or
his
knowledge
but
to
be
someone
else
that
is
a
thing
i
can
not
comprehend
it
has
often
been
said
that
every
man
who
has
suffered
misfortunes
prefers
to
be
himself
even
with
his
misfortunes
rather
than
to
be
someone
else
without
them
for
unfortunate
men
when
they
preserve
their
normality
in
their
misfortune
that
is
to
say
when
they
endeavour
to
persist
in
their
own
being
prefer
misfortune
to
for
myself
i
can
say
that
as
a
youth
and
even
as
a
child
i
remained
unmoved
when
shown
the
most
moving
pictures
of
hell
for
even
then
nothing
appeared
to
me
quite
so
horrible
as
nothingness
itself
it
was
a
furious
hunger
of
being
that
possessed
me
an
appetite
for
divinity
as
one
of
our
ascetics
has
put
it
to
propose
to
a
man
that
he
should
be
someone
else
that
he
should
become
someone
else
is
to
propose
to
him
that
he
should
cease
to
be
himself
everyone
defends
his
own
personality
and
only
consents
to
a
change
in
his
mode
of
thinking
or
of
feeling
in
so
far
as
this
change
is
able
to
enter
into
the
unity
of
his
spirit
and
become
involved
in
its
continuity
in
so
far
as
this
change
can
harmonize
and
integrate
itself
with
all
the
rest
of
his
mode
of
being
thinking
and
feeling
and
can
at
the
same
time
knit
itself
with
his
memories
neither
of
a
man
nor
of
a
people
which
is
in
a
certain
sense
also
a
man
can
a
change
be
demanded
which
breaks
the
unity
and
continuity
of
the
person
a
man
can
change
greatly
almost
completely
even
but
the
change
must
take
place
within
his
continuity
it
is
true
that
in
certain
individuals
there
occur
what
are
called
changes
of
personality
but
these
are
pathological
cases
and
as
such
are
studied
by
alienists
in
these
changes
of
personality
memory
the
basis
of
consciousness
is
completely
destroyed
and
all
that
is
left
to
the
sufferer
as
the
substratum
of
his
individual
continuity
which
has
now
ceased
to
be
personal
is
the
physical
organism
for
the
subject
who
suffers
it
such
an
infirmity
is
equivalent
to
death
it
is
not
equivalent
to
death
only
for
those
who
expect
to
inherit
his
fortune
if
he
possesses
one
and
this
infirmity
is
nothing
less
than
a
revolution
a
veritable
revolution
a
disease
is
in
a
certain
sense
an
organic
dissociation
it
is
a
rebellion
of
some
element
or
organ
of
the
living
body
which
breaks
the
vital
synergy
and
seeks
an
end
distinct
from
that
which
the
other
elements
with
it
seek
its
end
considered
in
itself
that
is
to
say
in
the
abstract
may
be
more
elevated
more
noble
more
anything
you
like
but
it
is
different
to
fly
and
breathe
in
the
air
may
be
better
than
to
swim
and
breathe
in
the
water
but
if
the
fins
of
a
fish
aimed
at
converting
themselves
into
wings
the
fish
as
a
fish
would
perish
and
it
is
useless
to
say
that
it
would
end
by
becoming
a
bird
if
in
this
becoming
there
was
not
a
process
of
continuity
i
do
not
precisely
know
but
perhaps
it
may
be
possible
for
a
fish
to
engender
a
bird
or
another
fish
more
akin
to
a
bird
than
itself
but
a
fish
this
fish
can
not
itself
and
during
its
own
lifetime
become
a
bird
everything
in
me
that
conspires
to
break
the
unity
and
continuity
of
my
life
conspires
to
destroy
me
and
consequently
to
destroy
itself
every
individual
in
a
people
who
conspires
to
break
the
spiritual
unity
and
continuity
of
that
people
tends
to
destroy
it
and
to
destroy
himself
as
a
part
of
that
people
what
if
some
other
people
is
better
than
our
own
very
possibly
although
perhaps
we
do
not
clearly
understand
what
is
meant
by
better
or
worse
richer
granted
more
cultured
granted
likewise
happier
well
happiness
but
still
let
it
pass
a
conquering
people
or
what
is
called
conquering
while
we
are
conquered
well
and
good
all
this
is
good
but
it
is
something
different
and
that
is
enough
because
for
me
the
becoming
other
than
i
am
the
breaking
of
the
unity
and
continuity
of
my
life
is
to
cease
to
be
he
who
i
am
that
is
to
say
it
is
simply
to
cease
to
be
and
that
no
anything
rather
than
that
another
you
say
might
play
the
part
that
i
play
as
well
or
better
another
might
fulfil
my
function
in
society
yes
but
it
would
not
be
i
i
i
i
always
i
some
reader
will
exclaim
and
who
are
you
i
might
reply
in
the
words
of
obermann
that
tremendous
man
obermann
for
the
universe
nothing
for
myself
everything
but
no
i
would
rather
remind
him
of
a
doctrine
of
the
man
kant
to
wit
that
we
ought
to
think
of
our
not
as
means
but
as
ends
for
the
question
does
not
touch
me
alone
it
touches
you
also
grumbling
reader
it
touches
each
and
all
singular
judgments
have
the
value
of
universal
judgments
the
logicians
say
the
singular
is
not
particular
it
is
universal
man
is
an
end
not
a
means
all
civilization
addresses
itself
to
man
to
each
man
to
each
i
what
is
that
idol
call
it
humanity
or
call
it
what
you
like
to
which
all
men
and
each
individual
man
must
be
sacrificed
for
i
sacrifice
myself
for
my
neighbours
for
my
for
my
children
and
these
sacrifice
themselves
in
their
turn
for
theirs
and
theirs
again
for
those
that
come
after
them
and
so
on
in
a
series
of
generations
and
who
receives
the
fruit
of
this
sacrifice
those
who
talk
to
us
about
this
fantastic
sacrifice
this
dedication
without
an
object
are
wont
to
talk
to
us
also
about
the
right
to
live
what
is
this
right
to
live
they
tell
me
i
am
here
to
realize
i
know
not
what
social
end
but
i
feel
that
i
like
each
one
of
my
fellows
am
here
to
realize
myself
to
live
yes
yes
i
see
it
all
an
enormous
social
activity
a
mighty
civilization
a
profuseness
of
science
of
art
of
industry
of
morality
and
afterwards
when
we
have
filled
the
world
with
industrial
marvels
with
great
factories
with
roads
museums
and
libraries
we
shall
fall
exhausted
at
the
foot
of
it
all
and
it
will
subsist
for
whom
was
man
made
for
science
or
was
science
made
for
man
why
the
reader
will
exclaim
again
we
are
coming
back
to
what
the
catechism
says
for
whom
did
god
create
the
world
for
man
well
why
not
so
ought
the
man
who
is
a
man
to
reply
the
ant
if
it
took
account
of
these
matters
and
were
a
person
would
reply
for
the
ant
and
it
would
reply
rightly
the
world
is
made
for
consciousness
for
each
consciousness
a
human
soul
is
worth
all
the
universe
someone
i
know
not
whom
has
said
and
said
magnificently
a
human
soul
mind
you
not
a
human
life
not
this
life
and
it
happens
that
the
less
a
man
believes
in
the
soul
that
is
to
say
in
his
conscious
immortality
personal
and
concrete
the
more
he
will
exaggerate
the
worth
of
this
poor
transitory
life
this
is
the
source
from
which
springs
all
that
effeminate
sentimental
ebullition
against
war
true
a
man
ought
not
to
wish
to
die
but
the
death
to
be
renounced
is
the
death
of
the
soul
whosoever
will
save
his
life
shall
lose
it
says
the
gospel
but
it
does
not
say
whosoever
will
save
his
soul
the
immortal
soul
or
at
any
rate
which
we
believe
and
wish
to
be
immortal
and
what
all
the
objectivists
do
not
see
or
rather
do
not
wish
to
see
is
that
when
a
man
affirms
his
i
his
personal
consciousness
he
affirms
man
man
concrete
and
real
affirms
the
true
humanism
the
humanism
of
man
not
of
the
things
of
man
and
in
affirming
man
he
affirms
consciousness
for
the
only
consciousness
of
which
we
have
consciousness
is
that
of
man
the
world
is
for
consciousness
or
rather
this
this
notion
of
finality
and
feeling
rather
than
notion
this
teleological
feeling
is
born
only
where
there
is
consciousness
consciousness
and
finality
are
fundamentally
the
same
thing
if
the
sun
possessed
consciousness
it
would
think
no
doubt
that
it
lived
in
order
to
give
light
to
the
worlds
but
it
would
also
and
above
all
think
that
the
worlds
existed
in
order
that
it
might
give
them
light
and
enjoy
itself
in
giving
them
light
and
so
live
and
it
would
think
well
and
all
this
tragic
fight
of
man
to
save
himself
this
immortal
craving
for
immortality
which
caused
the
man
kant
to
make
that
immortal
leap
of
which
i
have
spoken
all
this
is
simply
a
fight
for
consciousness
if
consciousness
is
as
some
inhuman
thinker
has
said
nothing
more
than
a
flash
of
light
between
two
eternities
of
darkness
then
there
is
nothing
more
execrable
than
existence
some
may
espy
a
fundamental
contradiction
in
everything
that
i
am
saying
now
expressing
a
longing
for
unending
life
now
affirming
that
this
earthly
life
does
not
possess
the
value
that
is
given
to
it
contradiction
to
be
sure
the
contradiction
of
my
heart
that
says
yes
and
of
my
head
that
says
no
of
course
there
is
contradiction
who
does
not
recollect
those
words
of
the
gospel
lord
i
believe
help
thou
my
unbelief
contradiction
of
course
since
we
only
live
in
and
by
contradictions
since
life
is
tragedy
and
the
tragedy
is
perpetual
struggle
without
victory
or
the
hope
of
victory
life
is
contradiction
the
values
we
are
discussing
are
as
you
see
values
of
the
heart
and
against
values
of
the
heart
reasons
do
not
avail
for
reasons
are
only
reasons
that
is
to
say
they
are
not
even
truths
there
is
a
class
of
pedantic
pedants
by
nature
and
by
grace
who
remind
me
of
that
man
who
purposing
to
console
a
father
whose
son
has
suddenly
died
in
the
flower
of
his
years
says
to
him
patience
my
friend
we
all
must
die
would
you
think
it
strange
if
this
father
were
offended
at
such
an
impertinence
for
it
is
an
impertinence
there
are
times
when
even
an
axiom
can
become
an
impertinence
how
many
times
may
it
not
be
said
pensar
cual
tú
sólo
es
preciso
no
tener
nada
mas
que
there
are
in
fact
people
who
appear
to
think
only
with
the
brain
or
with
whatever
may
be
the
specific
thinking
organ
while
others
think
with
all
the
body
and
all
the
soul
with
the
blood
with
the
marrow
of
the
bones
with
the
heart
with
the
lungs
with
the
belly
with
the
life
and
the
people
who
think
only
with
the
brain
develop
into
they
become
the
professionals
of
thought
and
you
know
what
a
professional
is
you
know
what
a
product
of
the
differentiation
of
labour
is
take
a
professional
boxer
he
has
learnt
to
hit
with
such
economy
of
effort
that
while
concentrating
all
his
strength
in
the
blow
he
only
brings
into
play
just
those
muscles
that
are
required
for
the
immediate
and
definite
object
of
his
action
to
knock
out
his
opponent
a
blow
given
by
a
will
not
have
so
much
immediate
objective
efficiency
but
it
will
more
greatly
vitalize
the
striker
causing
him
to
bring
into
play
almost
the
whole
of
his
body
the
one
is
the
blow
of
a
boxer
the
other
that
of
a
man
and
it
is
notorious
that
the
hercules
of
the
circus
the
athletes
of
the
ring
are
not
as
a
rule
healthy
they
knock
out
their
opponents
they
lift
enormous
weights
but
they
die
of
phthisis
or
dyspepsia
if
a
philosopher
is
not
a
man
he
is
anything
but
a
philosopher
he
is
above
all
a
pedant
and
a
pedant
is
a
caricature
of
a
man
the
cultivation
of
any
branch
of
science
of
chemistry
of
physics
of
geometry
of
philology
may
be
a
work
of
differentiated
specialization
and
even
so
only
within
very
narrow
limits
and
restrictions
but
philosophy
like
poetry
is
a
work
of
integration
and
synthesis
or
else
it
is
merely
erudition
all
knowledge
has
an
ultimate
object
knowledge
for
the
sake
of
knowledge
is
say
what
you
will
nothing
but
a
dismal
begging
of
the
question
we
learn
something
either
for
an
immediate
practical
end
or
in
order
to
complete
the
rest
of
our
knowledge
even
the
knowledge
that
appears
to
us
to
be
most
theoretical
that
is
to
say
of
least
immediate
application
to
the
necessities
of
life
answers
to
a
necessity
which
is
no
less
real
because
it
is
intellectual
to
a
reason
of
economy
in
thinking
to
a
principle
of
unity
and
continuity
of
consciousness
but
just
as
a
scientific
fact
has
its
finality
in
the
rest
of
knowledge
so
the
philosophy
that
we
would
make
our
own
has
also
its
extrinsic
object
it
refers
to
our
whole
destiny
to
our
attitude
in
face
of
life
and
the
universe
and
the
most
tragic
problem
of
philosophy
is
to
reconcile
intellectual
necessities
with
the
necessities
of
the
heart
and
the
will
for
it
is
on
this
rock
that
every
philosophy
that
pretends
to
resolve
the
eternal
and
tragic
contradiction
the
basis
of
our
existence
breaks
to
pieces
but
do
all
men
face
this
contradiction
squarely
little
can
be
hoped
from
a
ruler
for
example
who
has
not
at
some
time
or
other
been
preoccupied
even
if
only
confusedly
with
the
first
beginning
and
the
ultimate
end
of
all
things
and
above
all
of
man
with
the
why
of
his
origin
and
the
wherefore
of
his
destiny
and
this
supreme
preoccupation
can
not
be
purely
rational
it
must
involve
the
heart
it
is
not
enough
to
think
about
our
destiny
it
must
be
felt
and
the
leader
of
men
who
affirms
and
proclaims
that
he
pays
no
heed
to
the
things
of
the
spirit
is
not
worthy
to
lead
them
by
which
i
do
not
mean
of
course
that
any
solution
is
to
be
required
of
him
solution
is
there
indeed
any
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
will
never
willingly
yield
myself
nor
entrust
my
confidence
to
any
popular
leader
who
is
not
penetrated
with
the
feeling
that
he
who
orders
a
people
orders
men
men
of
flesh
and
bone
men
who
are
born
suffer
and
although
they
do
not
wish
to
die
die
men
who
are
ends
in
themselves
not
merely
means
men
who
must
be
themselves
and
not
others
men
in
fine
who
seek
that
which
we
call
happiness
it
is
inhuman
for
example
to
sacrifice
one
generation
of
men
to
the
generation
which
follows
without
having
any
feeling
for
the
destiny
of
those
who
are
sacrificed
without
having
any
regard
not
for
their
memory
not
for
their
names
but
for
them
themselves
all
this
talk
of
a
man
surviving
in
his
children
or
in
his
works
or
in
the
universal
consciousness
is
but
vague
verbiage
which
satisfies
only
those
who
suffer
from
affective
stupidity
and
who
for
the
rest
may
be
persons
of
a
certain
cerebral
distinction
for
it
is
possible
to
possess
great
talent
or
what
we
call
great
talent
and
yet
to
be
stupid
as
regards
the
feelings
and
even
morally
imbecile
there
have
been
instances
these
affectively
stupid
persons
are
wont
to
say
that
it
is
useless
to
seek
to
delve
in
the
unknowable
or
to
kick
against
the
pricks
it
is
as
if
one
should
say
to
a
man
whose
leg
has
had
to
be
amputated
that
it
does
not
help
him
at
all
to
think
about
it
and
we
all
lack
something
only
some
of
us
feel
the
lack
and
others
do
not
or
they
pretend
not
to
feel
the
lack
and
then
they
are
hypocrites
a
pedant
who
beheld
solon
weeping
for
the
death
of
a
son
said
to
him
why
do
you
weep
thus
if
weeping
avails
nothing
and
the
sage
answered
him
precisely
for
that
reason
because
it
does
not
avail
it
is
manifest
that
weeping
avails
something
even
if
only
the
alleviation
of
distress
but
the
deep
sense
of
solon
reply
to
the
impertinent
questioner
is
plainly
seen
and
i
am
convinced
that
we
should
solve
many
things
if
we
all
went
out
into
the
streets
and
uncovered
our
griefs
which
perhaps
would
prove
to
be
but
one
sole
common
grief
and
joined
together
in
beweeping
them
and
crying
aloud
to
the
heavens
and
calling
upon
god
and
this
even
though
god
should
hear
us
not
but
he
would
hear
us
the
chiefest
sanctity
of
a
temple
is
that
it
is
a
place
to
which
men
go
to
weep
in
common
a
sung
in
common
by
a
multitude
tormented
by
destiny
has
as
much
value
as
a
philosophy
it
is
not
enough
to
cure
the
plague
we
must
learn
to
weep
for
it
yes
we
must
learn
to
weep
perhaps
that
is
the
supreme
wisdom
why
ask
solon
there
is
something
which
for
lack
of
a
better
name
we
will
call
the
tragic
sense
of
life
which
carries
with
it
a
whole
conception
of
life
itself
and
of
the
universe
a
whole
philosophy
more
or
less
formulated
more
or
less
conscious
and
this
sense
may
be
possessed
and
is
possessed
not
only
by
individual
men
but
by
whole
peoples
and
this
sense
does
not
so
much
flow
from
ideas
as
determine
them
even
though
afterwards
as
is
manifest
these
ideas
react
upon
it
and
confirm
it
sometimes
it
may
originate
in
a
chance
illness
dyspepsia
for
example
but
at
other
times
it
is
constitutional
and
it
is
useless
to
speak
as
we
shall
see
of
men
who
are
healthy
and
men
who
are
not
healthy
apart
from
the
fact
there
is
no
normal
standard
of
health
nobody
has
proved
that
man
is
necessarily
cheerful
by
nature
and
further
man
by
the
very
fact
of
being
man
of
possessing
consciousness
is
in
comparison
with
the
ass
or
the
crab
a
diseased
animal
consciousness
is
a
disease
among
men
of
flesh
and
bone
there
have
been
typical
examples
of
those
who
possess
this
tragic
sense
of
life
i
recall
now
marcus
aurelius
augustine
pascal
rousseau
thomson
leopardi
vigny
lenau
kleist
amiel
quental
kierkegaard
men
burdened
with
wisdom
rather
than
with
knowledge
and
there
are
i
believe
peoples
who
possess
this
tragic
sense
of
life
also
it
is
to
this
that
we
must
now
turn
our
attention
beginning
with
this
matter
of
health
and
disease
footnotes
there
is
a
play
here
upon
the
term
used
to
denote
the
dangerous
aerial
somersault
of
the
acrobat
which
can
not
be
rendered
in
the
same
word
is
used
in
spanish
to
denote
both
consciousness
and
conscience
if
the
latter
is
specifically
intended
the
qualifying
adjective
or
is
commonly
san
juan
de
los
angeles
to
be
lacking
in
everything
but
intelligence
is
the
necessary
qualification
for
thinking
like
you
james
thomson
author
of
city
of
dreadful
ii
the
to
some
perhaps
the
foregoing
reflections
may
seem
to
possess
a
certain
morbid
character
morbid
but
what
is
disease
precisely
and
what
is
health
may
not
disease
itself
possibly
be
the
essential
condition
of
that
which
we
call
progress
and
progress
itself
a
disease
who
does
not
know
the
mythical
tragedy
of
paradise
therein
dwelt
our
first
parents
in
a
state
of
perfect
health
and
perfect
innocence
and
jahwé
gave
them
to
eat
of
the
tree
of
life
and
created
all
things
for
them
but
he
commanded
them
not
to
taste
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
but
they
tempted
by
the
serpent
type
of
prudence
tasted
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
and
became
subject
to
all
diseases
and
to
death
which
is
their
crown
and
consummation
and
to
labour
and
to
progress
for
progress
according
to
this
legend
springs
from
original
sin
and
thus
it
was
the
curiosity
of
eve
of
woman
of
her
who
is
most
thrall
to
the
organic
necessities
of
life
and
of
the
conservation
of
life
that
occasioned
the
fall
and
with
the
fall
the
redemption
and
it
was
the
redemption
that
set
our
feet
on
the
way
to
god
and
made
it
possible
for
us
to
attain
to
him
and
to
be
in
him
do
you
want
another
version
of
our
origin
very
well
then
according
to
this
account
man
is
strictly
speaking
merely
a
species
of
gorilla
chimpanzee
or
the
like
more
or
less
hydrocephalous
once
on
a
time
an
anthropoid
monkey
had
a
diseased
offspring
diseased
from
the
strictly
animal
or
zoological
point
of
view
really
diseased
and
this
disease
although
a
source
of
weakness
resulted
in
a
positive
gain
in
the
struggle
for
survival
the
only
vertical
mammal
at
last
succeeded
in
standing
erect
man
the
upright
position
freed
him
from
the
necessity
of
using
his
hands
as
means
of
support
in
walking
he
was
able
therefore
to
oppose
the
thumb
to
the
other
four
fingers
to
seize
hold
of
objects
and
to
fashion
tools
and
it
is
well
known
that
the
hands
are
great
promoters
of
the
intelligence
this
same
position
gave
to
the
lungs
trachea
larynx
and
mouth
an
aptness
for
the
production
of
articulate
speech
and
speech
is
intelligence
moreover
this
position
causing
the
head
to
weigh
vertically
upon
the
trunk
facilitated
its
development
and
increase
of
weight
and
the
head
is
the
seat
of
the
mind
but
as
this
necessitated
greater
strength
and
resistance
in
the
bones
of
the
pelvis
than
in
those
of
species
whose
head
and
trunk
rest
upon
all
four
extremities
the
burden
fell
upon
woman
the
author
of
the
fall
according
to
genesis
of
bringing
forth
offspring
through
a
harder
framework
of
bone
and
jahwé
condemned
her
for
having
sinned
to
bring
forth
her
children
in
sorrow
the
gorilla
the
chimpanzee
the
and
their
kind
must
look
upon
man
as
a
feeble
and
infirm
animal
whose
strange
custom
it
is
to
store
up
his
dead
wherefore
and
this
primary
disease
and
all
subsequent
diseases
are
they
not
perhaps
the
capital
element
of
progress
arthritis
for
example
infects
the
blood
and
introduces
into
it
scoriæ
a
kind
of
refuse
of
an
imperfect
organic
combustion
but
may
not
this
very
impurity
happen
to
make
the
blood
more
stimulative
may
not
this
impure
blood
promote
a
more
active
cerebration
precisely
because
it
is
impure
water
that
is
chemically
pure
is
undrinkable
and
may
not
also
blood
that
is
physiologically
pure
be
unfit
for
the
brain
of
the
vertical
mammal
that
has
to
live
by
thought
the
history
of
medicine
moreover
teaches
us
that
progress
consists
not
so
much
in
expelling
the
germs
of
disease
or
rather
diseases
themselves
as
in
accommodating
them
to
our
organism
and
so
perhaps
enriching
it
in
dissolving
them
in
our
blood
what
but
this
is
the
meaning
of
vaccination
and
all
the
serums
and
immunity
from
infection
through
lapse
of
time
if
this
notion
of
absolute
health
were
not
an
abstract
category
something
which
does
not
strictly
exist
we
might
say
that
a
perfectly
healthy
man
would
be
no
longer
a
man
but
an
irrational
animal
irrational
because
of
the
lack
of
some
disease
to
set
a
spark
to
his
reason
and
this
disease
which
gives
us
the
appetite
of
knowing
for
the
sole
pleasure
of
knowing
for
the
delight
of
tasting
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
is
a
real
disease
and
a
tragic
one
anthrôpoi
ton
eidenai
oregontai
all
men
naturally
desire
to
know
thus
aristotle
begins
his
metaphysic
and
it
has
been
repeated
a
thousand
times
since
then
that
curiosity
or
the
desire
to
know
which
according
to
genesis
led
our
first
mother
to
sin
is
the
origin
of
knowledge
but
it
is
necessary
to
distinguish
here
between
the
desire
or
appetite
for
knowing
apparently
and
at
first
sight
for
the
love
of
knowledge
itself
between
the
eagerness
to
taste
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
the
necessity
of
knowing
for
the
sake
of
living
the
latter
which
gives
us
direct
and
immediate
knowledge
and
which
in
a
certain
sense
might
be
called
if
it
does
not
seem
too
paradoxical
unconscious
knowledge
is
common
both
to
men
and
animals
while
that
which
distinguishes
us
from
them
is
reflective
knowledge
the
knowing
that
we
know
man
has
debated
at
length
and
will
continue
to
debate
at
length
the
world
having
been
assigned
as
a
theatre
for
his
debates
concerning
the
origin
of
knowledge
but
apart
from
the
question
as
to
what
the
real
truth
about
this
origin
may
be
which
we
will
leave
until
later
it
is
a
certainly
ascertained
fact
that
in
the
apparential
order
of
things
in
the
life
of
beings
who
are
endowed
with
a
certain
more
or
less
cloudy
faculty
of
knowing
and
perceiving
or
who
at
any
rate
appear
to
act
as
if
they
were
so
endowed
knowledge
is
exhibited
to
us
as
bound
up
with
the
necessity
of
living
and
of
procuring
the
wherewithal
to
maintain
life
it
is
a
consequence
of
that
very
essence
of
being
which
according
to
spinoza
consists
in
the
effort
to
persist
indefinitely
in
its
own
being
speaking
in
terms
in
which
concreteness
verges
upon
grossness
it
may
be
said
that
the
brain
in
so
far
as
its
function
is
concerned
depends
upon
the
stomach
in
beings
which
rank
in
the
lowest
scale
of
life
those
actions
which
present
the
characteristics
of
will
those
which
appear
to
be
connected
with
a
more
or
less
clear
consciousness
are
actions
designed
to
procure
nourishment
for
the
being
performing
them
such
then
is
what
we
may
call
the
historical
origin
of
knowledge
whatever
may
be
its
origin
from
another
point
of
view
beings
which
appear
to
be
endowed
with
perception
perceive
in
order
to
be
able
to
live
and
only
perceive
in
so
far
as
they
require
to
do
so
in
order
to
live
but
perhaps
this
knowledge
the
utility
in
which
it
had
its
origin
being
exhausted
has
come
to
constitute
a
fund
of
knowledge
far
exceeding
that
required
for
the
bare
necessities
of
living
thus
we
have
first
the
necessity
of
knowing
in
order
to
live
and
next
arising
out
of
this
that
other
knowledge
which
we
might
call
superfluous
knowledge
or
knowledge
which
may
in
its
turn
come
to
constitute
a
new
necessity
curiosity
the
innate
desire
of
knowing
only
awakes
and
becomes
operative
after
the
necessity
of
knowing
for
the
sake
of
living
is
satisfied
and
although
sometimes
in
the
conditions
under
which
the
human
race
is
actually
living
it
may
not
so
befall
but
curiosity
may
prevail
over
necessity
and
knowledge
over
hunger
nevertheless
the
primordial
fact
is
that
curiosity
sprang
from
the
necessity
of
knowing
in
order
to
live
and
this
is
the
dead
weight
and
gross
matter
carried
in
the
matrix
of
science
aspiring
to
be
knowledge
for
the
sake
of
knowledge
to
know
the
truth
for
the
sake
of
the
truth
itself
science
is
forced
by
the
necessities
of
life
to
turn
aside
and
put
it
itself
at
their
service
while
men
believe
themselves
to
be
seeking
truth
for
its
own
sake
they
are
in
fact
seeking
life
in
truth
the
variations
of
science
depend
upon
the
variations
of
human
needs
and
men
of
science
are
wont
to
work
willingly
or
unwillingly
wittingly
or
unwittingly
in
the
service
of
the
powerful
or
in
that
of
a
people
that
demands
from
them
the
confirmation
of
its
own
desires
but
is
this
really
a
dead
weight
that
impedes
the
progress
of
science
or
is
it
not
rather
its
innermost
redeeming
essence
it
is
in
fact
the
latter
and
it
is
a
gross
stupidity
to
presume
to
rebel
against
the
very
condition
of
life
knowledge
is
employed
in
the
service
of
the
necessity
of
life
and
primarily
in
the
service
of
the
instinct
of
personal
preservation
this
necessity
and
this
instinct
have
created
in
man
the
organs
of
knowledge
and
given
them
such
capacity
as
they
possess
man
sees
hears
touches
tastes
and
smells
that
which
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
see
hear
touch
taste
and
smell
in
order
to
preserve
his
life
the
decay
or
the
loss
of
any
of
these
senses
increases
the
risks
with
which
his
life
is
environed
and
if
it
increases
them
less
in
the
state
of
society
in
which
we
are
actually
living
the
reason
is
that
some
see
hear
touch
and
smell
for
others
a
blind
man
by
himself
and
without
a
guide
could
not
live
long
society
is
an
additional
sense
it
is
the
true
common
sense
man
then
in
his
quality
of
an
isolated
individual
only
sees
hears
touches
tastes
and
smells
in
so
far
as
is
necessary
for
living
and
if
he
does
not
perceive
colours
below
red
or
above
violet
the
reason
perhaps
is
that
the
colours
which
he
does
perceive
suffice
for
the
purposes
of
and
the
senses
themselves
are
simplifying
apparati
which
eliminate
from
objective
reality
everything
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
know
in
order
to
utilize
objects
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
life
in
complete
darkness
an
animal
if
it
does
not
perish
ends
by
becoming
blind
parasites
which
live
in
the
intestines
of
other
animals
upon
the
nutritive
juices
which
they
find
ready
prepared
for
them
by
these
animals
as
they
do
not
need
either
to
see
or
hear
do
in
fact
neither
see
nor
hear
they
simply
adhere
a
kind
of
receptive
bag
to
the
being
upon
whom
they
live
for
these
parasites
the
visible
and
audible
world
does
not
exist
it
is
enough
for
them
that
the
animals
in
whose
intestines
they
live
see
and
hear
knowledge
then
is
primarily
at
the
service
of
the
instinct
of
which
is
indeed
as
we
have
said
with
spinoza
its
very
essence
and
thus
it
may
be
said
that
it
is
the
instinct
of
that
makes
perceptible
for
us
the
reality
and
truth
of
the
world
for
it
is
this
instinct
that
cuts
out
and
separates
that
which
exists
for
us
from
the
unfathomable
and
illimitable
region
of
the
possible
in
effect
that
which
has
existence
for
us
is
precisely
that
which
in
one
way
or
another
we
need
to
know
in
order
to
exist
ourselves
objective
existence
as
we
know
it
is
a
dependence
of
our
own
personal
existence
and
nobody
can
deny
that
there
may
not
exist
and
perhaps
do
exist
aspects
of
reality
unknown
to
us
at
any
rate
and
perhaps
unknowable
because
they
are
in
no
way
necessary
to
us
for
the
preservation
of
our
own
actual
existence
but
man
does
not
live
alone
he
is
not
an
isolated
individual
but
a
member
of
society
there
is
not
a
little
truth
in
the
saying
that
the
individual
like
the
atom
is
an
abstraction
yes
the
atom
apart
from
the
universe
is
as
much
an
abstraction
as
the
universe
apart
from
the
atom
and
if
the
individual
maintains
his
existence
by
the
instinct
of
society
owes
its
being
and
maintenance
to
the
individual
instinct
of
perpetuation
and
from
this
instinct
or
rather
from
society
springs
reason
reason
that
which
we
call
reason
reflex
and
reflective
knowledge
the
distinguishing
mark
of
man
is
a
social
product
it
owes
its
origin
perhaps
to
language
we
think
articulately
reflectively
thanks
to
articulate
language
and
this
language
arose
out
of
the
need
of
communicating
our
thought
to
our
neighbours
to
think
is
to
talk
with
oneself
and
each
one
of
us
talks
with
himself
thanks
to
our
having
had
to
talk
with
one
another
in
everyday
life
it
frequently
happens
that
we
hit
upon
an
idea
that
we
were
seeking
and
succeed
in
giving
it
form
that
is
to
say
we
obtain
the
idea
drawing
it
forth
from
the
mist
of
dim
perceptions
which
it
represents
thanks
to
the
efforts
which
we
make
to
present
it
to
others
thought
is
inward
language
and
the
inward
language
originates
in
the
outward
hence
it
results
that
reason
is
social
and
common
a
fact
pregnant
with
consequences
as
we
shall
have
occasion
to
see
now
if
there
is
a
reality
which
in
so
far
as
we
have
knowledge
of
it
is
the
creation
of
the
instinct
of
personal
preservation
and
of
the
senses
at
the
service
of
this
instinct
must
there
not
be
another
reality
not
less
real
than
the
former
the
creation
in
so
far
as
we
have
knowledge
of
it
of
the
instinct
of
perpetuation
the
instinct
of
the
species
and
of
the
senses
at
the
service
of
this
instinct
the
instinct
of
preservation
hunger
is
the
foundation
of
the
human
individual
the
instinct
of
perpetuation
love
in
its
most
rudimentary
and
physiological
form
is
the
foundation
of
human
society
and
just
as
man
knows
that
which
he
needs
to
know
in
order
that
he
may
preserve
his
existence
so
society
or
man
in
so
far
as
he
is
a
social
being
knows
that
which
he
needs
to
know
in
order
that
he
may
perpetuate
himself
in
society
there
is
a
world
the
sensible
world
that
is
the
child
of
hunger
and
there
is
another
world
the
ideal
world
that
is
the
child
of
love
and
just
as
there
are
senses
employed
in
the
service
of
the
knowledge
of
the
sensible
world
so
there
are
also
senses
at
present
for
the
most
part
dormant
for
social
consciousness
has
scarcely
awakened
employed
in
the
service
of
the
knowledge
of
the
ideal
world
and
why
must
we
deny
objective
reality
to
the
creations
of
love
of
the
instinct
of
perpetuation
since
we
allow
it
to
the
creations
of
hunger
or
the
instinct
of
preservation
for
if
it
be
said
that
the
former
creations
are
only
the
creations
of
our
imagination
without
objective
value
may
it
not
equally
be
said
of
the
latter
that
they
are
only
the
creations
of
our
senses
who
can
assert
that
there
is
not
an
invisible
and
intangible
world
perceived
by
the
inward
sense
that
lives
in
the
service
of
the
instinct
of
perpetuation
human
society
as
a
society
possesses
senses
which
the
individual
but
for
his
existence
in
society
would
lack
just
as
the
individual
man
who
is
in
his
turn
a
kind
of
society
possesses
senses
lacking
in
the
cells
of
which
he
is
composed
the
blind
cells
of
hearing
in
their
dim
consciousness
must
of
necessity
be
unaware
of
the
existence
of
the
visible
world
and
if
they
should
hear
it
spoken
of
they
would
perhaps
deem
it
to
be
the
arbitrary
creation
of
the
deaf
cells
of
sight
while
the
latter
in
their
turn
would
consider
as
illusion
the
audible
world
which
the
hearing
cells
create
we
have
remarked
before
that
the
parasites
which
live
in
the
intestines
of
higher
animals
feeding
upon
the
nutritive
juices
which
these
animals
supply
do
not
need
either
to
see
or
hear
and
therefore
for
them
the
visible
and
audible
world
does
not
exist
and
if
they
possessed
a
certain
degree
of
consciousness
and
took
account
of
the
fact
that
the
animal
at
whose
expense
they
live
believed
in
a
world
of
sight
and
hearing
they
would
perhaps
deem
such
belief
to
be
due
merely
to
the
extravagance
of
its
imagination
and
similarly
there
are
social
parasites
as
balfour
admirably
observes
who
receiving
from
the
society
in
which
they
live
the
motives
of
their
moral
conduct
deny
that
belief
in
god
and
the
other
life
is
a
necessary
foundation
for
good
conduct
and
for
a
tolerable
life
society
having
prepared
for
them
the
spiritual
nutriment
by
which
they
live
an
isolated
individual
can
endure
life
and
live
it
well
and
even
heroically
without
in
any
sort
believing
either
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
or
in
god
but
he
lives
the
life
of
a
spiritual
parasite
what
we
call
the
sense
of
honour
is
even
in
a
christian
product
and
i
will
say
further
that
if
there
exists
in
a
man
faith
in
god
joined
to
a
life
of
purity
and
moral
elevation
it
is
not
so
much
the
believing
in
god
that
makes
him
good
as
the
being
good
thanks
to
god
that
makes
him
believe
in
him
goodness
is
the
best
source
of
spiritual
i
am
well
aware
that
it
may
be
objected
that
all
this
talk
of
man
creating
the
sensible
world
and
love
the
ideal
world
of
the
blind
cells
of
hearing
and
the
deaf
cells
of
sight
of
spiritual
parasites
is
merely
metaphor
so
it
is
and
i
do
not
claim
to
discuss
otherwise
than
by
metaphor
and
it
is
true
that
this
social
sense
the
creature
of
love
the
creator
of
language
of
reason
and
of
the
ideal
world
that
springs
from
it
is
at
bottom
nothing
other
than
what
we
call
fancy
or
imagination
out
of
fancy
springs
reason
and
if
by
imagination
is
understood
a
faculty
which
fashions
images
capriciously
i
will
ask
what
is
caprice
and
in
any
case
the
senses
and
reason
are
also
fallible
we
shall
have
to
enquire
what
is
this
inner
social
faculty
the
imagination
which
personalizes
everything
and
which
employed
in
the
service
of
the
instinct
of
perpetuation
reveals
to
us
god
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
god
being
thus
a
social
product
but
this
we
will
reserve
till
later
and
now
why
does
man
philosophize
that
is
to
say
why
does
he
investigate
the
first
causes
and
ultimate
ends
of
things
why
does
he
seek
the
disinterested
truth
for
to
say
that
all
men
have
a
natural
tendency
to
know
is
true
but
wherefore
philosophers
seek
a
theoretic
or
ideal
for
their
human
work
the
work
of
philosophizing
but
they
are
not
usually
concerned
to
seek
the
practical
and
real
the
purpose
what
is
the
object
in
making
philosophy
in
thinking
it
and
then
expounding
it
to
one
fellows
what
does
the
philosopher
seek
in
it
and
with
it
the
truth
for
the
truth
own
sake
the
truth
in
order
that
we
may
subject
our
conduct
to
it
and
determine
our
spiritual
attitude
towards
life
and
the
universe
comformably
with
it
philosophy
is
a
product
of
the
humanity
of
each
philosopher
and
each
philosopher
is
a
man
of
flesh
and
bone
who
addresses
himself
to
other
men
of
flesh
and
bone
like
himself
and
let
him
do
what
he
will
he
philosophizes
not
with
the
reason
only
but
with
the
will
with
the
feelings
with
the
flesh
and
with
the
bones
with
the
whole
soul
and
the
whole
body
it
is
the
man
that
philosophizes
i
do
not
wish
here
to
use
the
word
i
in
connection
with
philosophizing
lest
the
impersonal
i
should
be
understood
in
place
of
the
man
that
philosophizes
for
this
concrete
circumscribed
i
this
i
of
flesh
and
bone
that
suffers
from
and
finds
life
insupportable
if
death
is
the
annihilation
of
the
personal
consciousness
must
not
be
confounded
with
that
other
counterfeit
i
the
theoretical
i
which
fichte
smuggled
into
philosophy
nor
yet
with
the
unique
also
theoretical
of
max
stirner
it
is
better
to
say
we
understanding
however
the
we
who
are
circumscribed
in
space
knowledge
for
the
sake
of
knowledge
truth
for
truth
sake
this
is
inhuman
and
if
we
say
that
theoretical
philosophy
addresses
itself
to
practical
philosophy
truth
to
goodness
science
to
ethics
i
will
ask
and
to
what
end
is
goodness
is
it
perhaps
an
end
in
itself
good
is
simply
that
which
contributes
to
the
preservation
perpetuation
and
enrichment
of
consciousness
goodness
addresses
itself
to
man
to
the
maintenance
and
perfection
of
human
society
which
is
composed
of
men
and
to
what
end
is
this
so
act
that
your
action
may
be
a
pattern
to
all
men
kant
tells
us
that
is
well
but
wherefore
we
must
needs
seek
for
a
wherefore
in
the
of
all
philosophy
in
the
real
the
practical
not
the
theoretical
there
is
a
wherefore
the
philosopher
philosophizes
for
something
more
than
for
the
sake
of
philosophizing
vivere
deinde
says
the
old
latin
adage
and
as
the
philosopher
is
a
man
before
he
is
a
philosopher
he
must
needs
live
before
he
can
philosophize
and
in
fact
he
philosophizes
in
order
to
live
and
usually
he
philosophizes
either
in
order
to
resign
himself
to
life
or
to
seek
some
finality
in
it
or
to
distract
himself
and
forget
his
griefs
or
for
pastime
and
amusement
a
good
illustration
of
this
last
case
is
to
be
found
in
that
terrible
athenian
ironist
socrates
of
whom
xenophon
relates
in
his
that
he
discovered
to
theodata
the
courtesan
the
wiles
that
she
ought
to
make
use
of
in
order
to
lure
lovers
to
her
house
so
aptly
that
she
begged
him
to
act
as
her
companion
in
the
chase
her
pimp
in
a
word
and
philosophy
is
wont
in
fact
not
infrequently
to
convert
itself
into
a
kind
of
art
of
spiritual
pimping
and
sometimes
into
an
opiate
for
lulling
sorrows
to
sleep
i
take
at
random
a
book
of
metaphysics
the
first
that
comes
to
my
hand
and
space
a
metaphysical
by
shadworth
hodgson
i
open
it
and
in
the
fifth
paragraph
of
the
first
chapter
of
the
first
part
i
read
metaphysics
is
properly
speaking
not
a
science
but
a
philosophy
that
is
it
is
a
science
whose
end
is
in
itself
in
the
gratification
and
education
of
the
minds
which
carry
it
on
not
in
external
purpose
such
as
the
founding
of
any
art
conducive
to
the
welfare
of
life
let
us
examine
this
we
see
that
metaphysics
is
not
properly
speaking
a
science
that
is
it
is
a
science
whose
end
is
in
itself
and
this
science
which
properly
speaking
is
not
a
science
has
its
end
in
itself
in
the
gratification
and
education
of
the
minds
that
cultivate
it
but
what
are
we
to
understand
is
its
end
in
itself
or
is
it
to
gratify
and
educate
the
minds
that
cultivate
it
either
the
one
or
the
other
hodgson
afterwards
adds
that
the
end
of
metaphysics
is
not
any
external
purpose
such
as
that
of
founding
an
art
conducive
to
the
welfare
of
life
but
is
not
the
gratification
of
the
mind
of
him
who
cultivates
philosophy
part
of
the
of
his
life
let
the
reader
consider
this
passage
of
the
english
metaphysician
and
tell
me
if
it
is
not
a
tissue
of
contradictions
such
a
contradiction
is
inevitable
when
an
attempt
is
made
to
define
humanly
this
theory
of
science
of
knowledge
whose
end
is
in
itself
of
knowing
for
the
sake
of
knowing
of
attaining
truth
for
the
sake
of
truth
science
exists
only
in
personal
consciousness
and
thanks
to
it
astronomy
mathematics
have
no
other
reality
than
that
which
they
possess
as
knowledge
in
the
minds
of
those
who
study
and
cultivate
them
and
if
some
day
all
personal
consciousness
must
come
to
an
end
on
the
earth
if
some
day
the
human
spirit
must
return
to
the
nothingness
that
is
to
say
to
the
absolute
unconsciousness
from
whence
it
sprang
and
if
there
shall
no
more
be
any
spirit
that
can
avail
itself
of
all
our
accumulated
knowledge
then
to
what
end
is
this
knowledge
for
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
problem
of
the
personal
immortality
of
the
soul
involves
the
future
of
the
whole
human
species
this
series
of
contradictions
into
which
the
englishman
falls
in
his
desire
to
explain
the
theory
of
a
science
whose
end
is
in
itself
is
easily
understood
when
it
is
remembered
that
it
is
an
englishman
who
speaks
and
that
the
englishman
is
before
everything
else
a
man
perhaps
a
german
specialist
a
philosopher
who
had
made
philosophy
his
speciality
who
had
first
murdered
his
humanity
and
then
buried
it
in
his
philosophy
would
be
better
able
to
explain
this
theory
of
a
science
whose
end
is
in
itself
and
of
knowledge
for
the
sake
of
knowledge
take
the
man
spinoza
that
portuguese
jew
exiled
in
holland
read
his
as
a
despairing
elegiac
poem
which
in
fact
it
is
and
tell
me
if
you
do
not
hear
beneath
the
disemburdened
and
seemingly
serene
propositions
the
lugubrious
echo
of
the
prophetic
psalms
it
is
not
the
philosophy
of
resignation
but
of
despair
and
when
he
wrote
that
the
free
man
thinks
of
nothing
less
than
of
death
and
that
his
wisdom
consists
in
meditating
not
on
death
but
on
life
homo

de
nulla
re
minus
quam
de
morte
cogitat
et
eius
sapientia
non
mortis
sed
vitæ
meditatio

part
prop
lxvii
when
he
wrote
that
he
felt
as
we
all
feel
that
we
are
slaves
and
he
did
in
fact
think
about
death
and
he
wrote
it
in
a
vain
endeavour
to
free
himself
from
this
thought
nor
in
writing
proposition
xlii
of
part
that
happiness
is
not
the
reward
of
virtue
but
virtue
itself
did
he
feel
one
may
be
sure
what
he
wrote
for
this
is
usually
the
reason
why
men
philosophize
in
order
to
convince
themselves
even
though
they
fail
in
the
attempt
and
this
desire
of
convincing
oneself
that
is
to
say
this
desire
of
doing
violence
to
one
own
human
nature
is
the
real
of
not
a
few
philosophies
whence
do
i
come
and
whence
comes
the
world
in
which
and
by
which
i
live
whither
do
i
go
and
whither
goes
everything
that
environs
me
what
does
it
all
mean
such
are
the
questions
that
man
asks
as
soon
as
he
frees
himself
from
the
brutalizing
necessity
of
labouring
for
his
material
sustenance
and
if
we
look
closely
we
shall
see
that
beneath
these
questions
lies
the
wish
to
know
not
so
much
the
why
as
the
wherefore
not
the
cause
but
the
end
cicero
definition
of
philosophy
is
well
known
the
knowledge
of
things
divine
and
human
and
of
the
causes
in
which
these
things
are
contained
divinarum
et
humanarum
causarumque
quibus
hæ
res
but
in
reality
these
causes
are
for
us
ends
and
what
is
the
supreme
cause
god
but
the
supreme
end
the
why
interests
us
only
in
view
of
the
wherefore
we
wish
to
know
whence
we
came
only
in
order
the
better
to
be
able
to
ascertain
whither
we
are
going
this
ciceronian
definition
which
is
the
stoic
definition
is
also
found
in
that
formidable
intellectualist
clement
of
alexandria
who
was
canonized
by
the
catholic
church
and
he
expounds
it
in
the
fifth
chapter
of
the
first
of
his
but
this
same
christian
philosopher
christian
in
the
chapter
of
his
fourth
tells
us
that
for
the
gnostic
that
is
to
say
the
intellectual
knowledge
ought
to
suffice
and
he
adds
i
will
dare
aver
that
it
is
not
because
he
wishes
to
be
saved
that
he
who
devotes
himself
to
knowledge
for
the
sake
of
the
divine
science
itself
chooses
knowledge
for
the
exertion
of
the
intellect
by
exercise
is
prolonged
to
a
perpetual
exertion
and
the
perpetual
exertion
of
the
intellect
is
the
essence
of
an
intelligent
being
which
results
from
an
uninterrupted
process
of
admixture
and
remains
eternal
contemplation
a
living
substance
could
we
then
suppose
anyone
proposing
to
the
gnostic
whether
he
would
choose
the
knowledge
of
god
or
everlasting
salvation
and
if
these
which
are
entirely
identical
were
separable
he
would
without
the
least
hesitation
choose
the
knowledge
of
god
may
he
may
god
himself
whom
we
long
to
enjoy
and
possess
eternally
deliver
us
from
this
clementine
gnosticism
or
intellectualism
why
do
i
wish
to
know
whence
i
come
and
whither
i
go
whence
comes
and
whither
goes
everything
that
environs
me
and
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
for
i
do
not
wish
to
die
utterly
and
i
wish
to
know
whether
i
am
to
die
or
not
definitely
if
i
do
not
die
what
is
my
destiny
and
if
i
die
then
nothing
has
any
meaning
for
me
and
there
are
three
solutions
i
know
that
i
shall
die
utterly
and
then
irremediable
despair
or
i
know
that
i
shall
not
die
utterly
and
then
resignation
or
i
can
not
know
either
one
or
the
other
and
then
resignation
in
despair
or
despair
in
resignation
a
desperate
resignation
or
a
resigned
despair
and
hence
conflict
it
is
best
some
reader
will
say
not
to
concern
yourself
with
what
can
not
be
known
but
is
it
possible
in
his
very
beautiful
poem
ancient
tennyson
said
thou
canst
not
prove
the
nameless
o
my
son
nor
canst
thou
prove
the
world
thou
movest
in
thou
canst
not
prove
that
thou
art
body
alone
thou
canst
not
prove
that
thou
art
spirit
alone
nor
canst
thou
prove
that
thou
art
both
in
one
nor
canst
thou
prove
thou
art
immortal
no
nor
yet
that
thou
art
mortal
nay
my
son
thou
canst
not
prove
that
i
who
speak
with
thee
am
not
thyself
in
converse
with
thyself
for
nothing
worthy
proving
can
be
proven
nor
yet
disproven
wherefore
thou
be
wise
cleave
ever
to
the
sunnier
side
of
doubt
cling
to
faith
beyond
the
forms
of
faith
yes
perhaps
as
the
sage
says
nothing
worthy
proving
can
be
proven
nor
yet
disproven
but
can
we
restrain
that
instinct
which
urges
man
to
wish
to
know
and
above
all
to
wish
to
know
the
things
which
may
conduce
to
life
to
eternal
life
eternal
life
not
eternal
knowledge
as
the
alexandrian
gnostic
said
for
living
is
one
thing
and
knowing
is
another
and
as
we
shall
see
perhaps
there
is
such
an
opposition
between
the
two
that
we
may
say
that
everything
vital
is
not
merely
irrational
and
that
everything
rational
is
and
this
is
the
basis
of
the
tragic
sense
of
life
the
defect
of
descartes
of
lies
not
in
the
antecedent
methodical
doubt
not
in
his
beginning
by
resolving
to
doubt
everything
a
merely
intellectual
device
but
in
his
resolution
to
begin
by
emptying
himself
of
himself
of
descartes
of
the
real
man
the
man
of
flesh
and
bone
the
man
who
does
not
want
to
die
in
order
that
he
might
be
a
mere
thinker
that
is
an
abstraction
but
the
real
man
returned
and
thrust
himself
into
the
philosophy
bon
sens
est
la
chose
du
monde
la
mieux
thus
begins
the
of
and
this
good
sense
saved
him
he
continues
talking
about
himself
about
the
man
descartes
telling
us
among
other
things
that
he
greatly
esteemed
eloquence
and
loved
poetry
that
he
delighted
above
all
in
mathematics
because
of
the
evidence
and
certainty
of
its
reasons
and
that
he
revered
our
theology
and
claimed
as
much
as
any
to
attain
to
heaven
prétendais
autant
autre
à
gagner
le
and
this
pretension
a
very
laudable
one
i
think
and
above
all
very
natural
was
what
prevented
him
from
deducing
all
the
consequences
of
his
methodical
doubt
the
man
descartes
claimed
as
much
as
any
other
to
attain
to
heaven
but
having
learned
as
a
thing
very
sure
that
the
way
to
it
is
not
less
open
to
the
most
ignorant
than
to
the
most
learned
and
that
the
revealed
truths
which
lead
thither
are
beyond
our
intelligence
i
did
not
dare
submit
them
to
my
feeble
reasonings
and
i
thought
that
to
undertake
to
examine
them
and
to
succeed
therein
i
should
want
some
extraordinary
help
from
heaven
and
need
to
be
more
than
man
and
here
we
have
the
man
here
we
have
the
man
who
did
not
feel
obliged
thank
god
to
make
a
profession
of
science
in
order
to
increase
his
means
and
who
did
not
pretend
to
play
the
cynic
and
despise
glory
and
afterwards
he
tells
us
how
he
was
compelled
to
make
a
sojourn
in
germany
and
there
shut
up
in
a
stove
he
began
to
philosophize
his
method
but
in
germany
shut
up
in
a
stove
and
such
his
discourse
is
a
and
the
stove
a
german
one
although
the
philosopher
shut
up
in
it
was
a
frenchman
who
proposed
to
himself
to
attain
to
heaven
and
he
arrives
at
the
ergo
which
augustine
had
already
anticipated
but
the
implicit
in
this
enthymeme
cogito
ergo
ego
is
an
unreal
that
is
an
ideal
or
i
and
its
its
existence
something
unreal
also
i
think
therefore
i
am
can
only
mean
i
think
therefore
i
am
a
thinker
this
being
of
the
i
am
which
is
deduced
from
i
think
is
merely
a
knowing
this
being
is
knowledge
but
not
life
and
the
primary
reality
is
not
that
i
think
but
that
i
live
for
those
also
live
who
do
not
think
although
this
living
may
not
be
a
real
living
god
what
contradictions
when
we
seek
to
join
in
wedlock
life
and
reason
the
truth
is
ergo
i
am
therefore
i
think
although
not
everything
that
is
thinks
is
not
consciousness
of
thinking
above
all
consciousness
of
being
is
pure
thought
possible
without
consciousness
of
self
without
personality
can
there
exist
pure
knowledge
without
feeling
without
that
species
of
materiality
which
feeling
lends
to
it
do
we
not
perhaps
feel
thought
and
do
we
not
feel
ourselves
in
the
act
of
knowing
and
willing
could
not
the
man
in
the
stove
have
said
i
feel
therefore
i
am
or
i
will
therefore
i
am
and
to
feel
oneself
is
it
not
perhaps
to
feel
oneself
imperishable
to
will
oneself
is
it
not
to
wish
oneself
eternal
that
is
to
say
not
to
wish
to
die
what
the
sorrowful
jew
of
amsterdam
called
the
essence
of
the
thing
the
effort
that
it
makes
to
persist
indefinitely
in
its
own
being
the
longing
for
immortality
is
it
not
perhaps
the
primal
and
fundamental
condition
of
all
reflective
or
human
knowledge
and
is
it
not
therefore
the
true
base
the
real
of
all
philosophy
although
the
philosophers
perverted
by
intellectualism
may
not
recognize
it
and
moreover
it
was
the
that
introduced
a
distinction
which
although
fruitful
of
truths
has
been
fruitful
also
of
confusions
and
this
distinction
is
that
between
object
and
subject
there
is
scarcely
any
distinction
that
does
not
also
lead
to
confusion
but
we
will
return
to
this
later
for
the
present
let
us
remain
keenly
suspecting
that
the
longing
not
to
die
the
hunger
for
personal
immortality
the
effort
whereby
we
tend
to
persist
indefinitely
in
our
own
being
which
is
according
to
the
tragic
jew
our
very
essence
that
this
is
the
affective
basis
of
all
knowledge
and
the
personal
inward
of
all
human
philosophy
wrought
by
a
man
and
for
men
and
we
shall
see
how
the
solution
of
this
inward
affective
problem
a
solution
which
may
be
but
the
despairing
renunciation
of
the
attempt
at
a
solution
is
that
which
colours
all
the
rest
of
philosophy
underlying
even
the
problem
of
knowledge
there
is
simply
this
human
feeling
just
as
underlying
the
enquiry
into
the
why
the
cause
there
is
simply
the
search
for
the
wherefore
the
end
all
the
rest
is
either
to
deceive
oneself
or
to
wish
to
deceive
others
and
to
wish
to
deceive
others
in
order
to
deceive
oneself
and
this
personal
and
affective
of
all
philosophy
and
all
religion
is
the
tragic
sense
of
life
let
us
now
proceed
to
consider
this
footnote
foundations
of
belief
being
notes
introductory
to
the
study
of
by
the
right
hon
arthur
james
balfour
london
so
it
is
with
those
persons
who
claim
to
show
by
their
example
that
naturalism
is
practically
consistent
with
the
maintenance
of
ethical
ideals
with
which
naturalism
has
no
natural
affinity
their
spiritual
life
is
parasitic
it
is
sheltered
by
convictions
which
belong
not
to
them
but
to
the
society
of
which
they
form
a
part
it
is
nourished
by
processes
in
which
they
take
no
share
and
when
those
convictions
decay
and
those
processes
come
to
an
end
the
alien
life
which
they
have
maintained
can
scarce
be
expected
to
outlast
them
chap
iii
the
hunger
of
immortality
let
us
pause
to
consider
this
immortal
yearning
for
immortality
even
though
the
gnostics
or
intellectuals
may
be
able
to
say
that
what
follows
is
not
philosophy
but
rhetoric
moreover
the
divine
plato
when
he
discussed
the
immortality
of
the
soul
in
his
said
that
it
was
proper
to
clothe
it
in
legend
first
of
all
let
us
recall
once
again
and
it
will
not
be
for
the
last
time
that
saying
of
spinoza
that
every
being
endeavours
to
persist
in
itself
and
that
this
endeavour
is
its
actual
essence
and
implies
indefinite
time
and
that
the
soul
in
fine
sometimes
with
a
clear
and
distinct
idea
sometimes
confusedly
tends
to
persist
in
its
being
with
indefinite
duration
and
is
aware
of
its
persistency
part
props
it
is
impossible
for
us
in
effect
to
conceive
of
ourselves
as
not
existing
and
no
effort
is
capable
of
enabling
consciousness
to
realize
absolute
unconsciousness
its
own
annihilation
try
reader
to
imagine
to
yourself
when
you
are
wide
awake
the
condition
of
your
soul
when
you
are
in
a
deep
sleep
try
to
fill
your
consciousness
with
the
representation
of
and
you
will
see
the
impossibility
of
it
the
effort
to
comprehend
it
causes
the
most
tormenting
dizziness
we
can
not
conceive
ourselves
as
not
existing
the
visible
universe
the
universe
that
is
created
by
the
instinct
of
becomes
all
too
narrow
for
me
it
is
like
a
cramped
cell
against
the
bars
of
which
my
soul
beats
its
wings
in
vain
its
lack
of
air
stifles
me
more
more
and
always
more
i
want
to
be
myself
and
yet
without
ceasing
to
be
myself
to
be
others
as
well
to
merge
myself
into
the
totality
of
things
visible
and
invisible
to
extend
myself
into
the
illimitable
of
space
and
to
prolong
myself
into
the
infinite
of
time
not
to
be
all
and
for
ever
is
as
if
not
to
be
at
least
let
me
be
my
whole
self
and
be
so
for
ever
and
ever
and
to
be
the
whole
of
myself
is
to
be
everybody
else
either
all
or
nothing
all
or
nothing
and
what
other
meaning
can
the
shakespearean
to
be
or
not
to
be
have
or
that
passage
in
where
it
is
said
of
marcius
he
wants
nothing
of
a
god
but
eternity
eternity
eternity
that
is
the
supreme
desire
the
thirst
of
eternity
is
what
is
called
love
among
men
and
whosoever
loves
another
wishes
to
eternalize
himself
in
him
nothing
is
real
that
is
not
eternal
from
the
poets
of
all
ages
and
from
the
depths
of
their
souls
this
tremendous
vision
of
the
flowing
away
of
life
like
water
has
wrung
bitter
cries
from
pindar
dream
of
a
shadow
to
calderón
life
is
a
dream
and
shakespeare
we
are
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
on
this
last
a
yet
more
tragic
sentence
than
calderón
for
whereas
the
castilian
only
declares
that
our
life
is
a
dream
but
not
that
we
ourselves
are
the
dreamers
of
it
the
englishman
makes
us
ourselves
a
dream
a
dream
that
dreams
the
vanity
of
the
passing
world
and
love
are
the
two
fundamental
and
notes
of
true
poetry
and
they
are
two
notes
of
which
neither
can
be
sounded
without
causing
the
other
to
vibrate
the
feeling
of
the
vanity
of
the
passing
world
kindles
love
in
us
the
only
thing
that
triumphs
over
the
vain
and
transitory
the
only
thing
that
fills
life
again
and
eternalizes
it
in
appearance
at
any
rate
for
in
reality
and
love
above
all
when
it
struggles
against
destiny
overwhelms
us
with
the
feeling
of
the
vanity
of
this
world
of
appearances
and
gives
us
a
glimpse
of
another
world
in
which
destiny
is
overcome

and
all
religion
has
sprung
historically
from
the
cult
of
the
dead
that
is
to
say
from
the
cult
of
immortality
the
tragic
portuguese
jew
of
amsterdam
wrote
that
the
free
man
thinks
of
nothing
less
than
of
death
but
this
free
man
is
a
dead
man
free
from
the
impulse
of
life
for
want
of
love
the
slave
of
his
liberty
this
thought
that
i
must
die
and
the
enigma
of
what
will
come
after
death
is
the
very
palpitation
of
my
consciousness
when
i
contemplate
the
green
serenity
of
the
fields
or
look
into
the
depths
of
clear
eyes
through
which
shines
a
my
consciousness
dilates
i
feel
the
diastole
of
the
soul
and
am
bathed
in
the
flood
of
the
life
that
flows
about
me
and
i
believe
in
my
future
but
instantly
the
voice
of
mystery
whispers
to
me
thou
shalt
cease
to
be
the
angel
of
death
touches
me
with
his
wing
and
the
systole
of
the
soul
floods
the
depths
of
my
spirit
with
the
blood
of
divinity
like
pascal
i
do
not
understand
those
who
assert
that
they
care
not
a
farthing
for
these
things
and
this
indifference
in
a
matter
that
touches
themselves
their
eternity
their
all
exasperates
me
rather
than
moves
me
to
compassion
astonishes
and
shocks
me
and
he
who
feels
thus
is
for
me
as
for
pascal
whose
are
the
words
just
quoted
a
monster
it
has
been
said
a
thousand
times
and
in
a
thousand
books
that
is
for
the
most
part
the
source
of
primitive
religions
and
it
may
be
strictly
said
that
what
most
distinguishes
man
from
the
other
animals
is
that
in
one
form
or
another
he
guards
his
dead
and
does
not
give
them
over
to
the
neglect
of
teeming
mother
earth
he
is
an
animal
that
guards
its
dead
and
from
what
does
he
thus
guard
them
from
what
does
he
so
futilely
protect
them
the
wretched
consciousness
shrinks
from
its
own
annihilation
and
just
as
an
animal
spirit
newly
severed
from
the
womb
of
the
world
finds
itself
confronted
with
the
world
and
knows
itself
distinct
from
it
so
consciousness
must
needs
desire
to
possess
another
life
than
that
of
the
world
itself
and
so
the
earth
would
run
the
risk
of
becoming
a
vast
cemetery
before
the
dead
themselves
should
die
again
when
mud
huts
or
straw
shelters
incapable
of
resisting
the
inclemency
of
the
weather

the
living
tumuli

he
who
pays

essentially

substantially
diseased

perhaps
it
may
be
like
life
itself
to
which
it
is
thrall
and
perhaps
the
only
health
possible
may
be
death
but
this
disease
is
the
fount
of
all
vigorous
health
from
the
depth
of
this
anguish
from
the

a

enveloping
you
in

the

you

crumbling

the

from

your

memory
vanishing
as
if
in
a
swoon
everything
melting
away
from
you
into
nothingness
and
you
yourself
also
melting
away
the
very
consciousness
of
nothingness
merely
as
the
phantom
harbourage
of
a
shadow
not
even
remaining
to
you
i
have
heard
it
related
of
a
poor
harvester
who
died
in
a
hospital
bed
that
when
the
priest
went
to
anoint
his
hands
with
the
oil
of
extreme
unction
he
refused
to
open
his
right
hand
which
clutched
a
few
dirty
coins
not
considering
that
very
soon
neither
his
hand
nor
he
himself
would
be
his
own
any
more
and
so
we
close
and
clench
not
our
hand
but
our
heart
seeking
to
clutch
the
world
in
it
a
friend
confessed
to
me
that
foreseeing
while
in
the
full
vigour
of
physical
health
the
near
approach
of
a
violent
death
he
proposed
to
concentrate
his
life
and
spend
the
few
days
which
he
calculated
still
remained
to
him
in
writing
a
book
vanity
of
vanities
if
at
the
death
of
the
body
which
sustains
me
and
which
i
call
mine
to
distinguish
it
from
the
self
that
is
i
my
consciousness
returns
to
the
absolute
unconsciousness
from
which
it
sprang
and
if
a
like
fate
befalls
all
my
brothers
in
humanity
then
is
our
human
race
nothing
but
a
fatidical
procession
of
phantoms
going
from
nothingness
to
nothingness
and
humanitarianism
the
most
inhuman
thing
known
and
the
remedy
is
not
that
suggested
in
the
quatrain
that
runs
vez
que
considero
que
me
tengo
de
morir
tiendo
la
capa
en
el

y
no
me
harto

no
the
remedy
is
to
consider
our
mortal
destiny
without
flinching
to
fasten
our
gaze
upon
the
gaze
of
the
sphinx
for
it
is
thus
that
the
malevolence
of
its
spell
is
discharmed
if
we
all
die
utterly
wherefore
does
everything
exist
wherefore
it
is
the
wherefore
of
the
sphinx
it
is
the
wherefore
that
corrodes
the
marrow
of
the
soul
it
is
the
begetter
of
that
anguish
which
gives
us
the
love
of
hope
among
the
poetic
laments
of
the
unhappy
cowper
there
are
some
lines
written
under
the
oppression
of
delirium
in
which
believing
himself
to
be
the
mark
of
the
divine
vengeance
he
exclaims
hell
might
afford
my
miseries
a
shelter
this
is
the
puritan
sentiment
the
preoccupation
with
sin
and
predestination
but
read
the
much
more
terrible
words
of
sénancour
expressive
of
the
catholic
not
the
protestant
despair
when
he
makes
his
obermann
say
est
périssable

se
peut
mais
périssons
en
résistant
et
si
le
néant
nous
est
réservé
ne
faisons
pas
que
ce
soit

justice
and
i
must
confess
painful
though
the
confession
be
that
in
the
days
of
the
simple
faith
of
my
childhood
descriptions
of
the
tortures
of
hell
however
terrible
never
made
me
tremble
for
i
always
felt
that
nothingness
was
much
more
terrifying
he
who
suffers
lives
and
he
who
lives
suffering
even
though
over
the
portal
of
his
abode
is
written
abandon
all
hope
loves
and
hopes
it
is
better
to
live
in
pain
than
to
cease
to
be
in
peace
the
truth
is
that
i
could
not
believe
in
this
atrocity
of
hell
of
an
eternity
of
punishment
nor
did
i
see
any
more
real
hell
than
nothingness
and
the
prospect
of
it
and
i
continue
in
the
belief
that
if
we
all
believed
in
our
salvation
from
nothingness
we
should
all
be
better
what
is
this
de
that
they
talk
about
nowadays
our
hunger
for
god
our
thirst
of
immortality
of
survival
will
always
stifle
in
us
this
pitiful
enjoyment
of
the
life
that
passes
and
abides
not
it
is
the
frenzied
love
of
life
the
love
that
would
have
life
to
be
unending
that
most
often
urges
us
to
long
for
death
if
it
is
true
that
i
am
to
die
utterly
we
say
to
ourselves
then
once
i
am
annihilated
the
world
has
ended
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
it
is
finished
why
then
should
it
not
end
forthwith
so
that
no
new
consciousnesses
doomed
to
suffer
the
tormenting
illusion
of
a
transient
and
apparential
existence
may
come
into
being
if
the
illusion
of
living
being
shattered
living
for
the
mere
sake
of
living
or
for
the
sake
of
others
who
are
likewise
doomed
to
die
does
not
satisfy
the
soul
what
is
the
good
of
living
our
best
remedy
is
death
and
thus
it
is
that
we
chant
the
praises
of
the
rest
because
of
our
dread
of
it
and
speak
of
liberating
death
leopardi
the
poet
of
sorrow
of
annihilation
having
lost
the
ultimate
illusion
that
of
believing
in
his
immortality
estremo

spoke
to
his
heart
of
vanitá
del
and
perceived
how
close
is
the
kinship
between
love
and
death
and
how
when
love
is
born
deep
down
in
the
heart
simultaneously
a
languid
and
weary
desire
to
die
is
felt
in
the
breast
the
greater
part
of
those
who
seek
death
at
their
own
hand
are
moved
thereto
by
love
it
is
the
supreme
longing
for
life
for
more
life
the
longing
to
prolong
and
perpetuate
life
that
urges
them
to
death
once
they
are
persuaded
of
the
vanity
of
this
longing
the
problem
is
tragic
and
eternal
and
the
more
we
seek
to
escape
from
it
the
more
it
thrusts
itself
upon
us
centuries
ago
in
his
dialogue
on
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
serene
plato
but
was
he
serene
spoke
of
the
uncertainty
of
our
dream
of
being
immortal
and
of
the
that
the
dream
might
be
vain
and
from
his
own
soul
there
escaped
this
profound
cry

the

o
glorious
is
the
risk
that
we
are
able
to
run
of
our
souls
never
dying
a
sentence
that
was
the
germ
of
pascal
famous
argument
of
the
wager
faced
with
this
risk
i
am
presented
with
arguments
designed
to
eliminate
it
arguments
demonstrating
the
absurdity
of
the
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
but
these
arguments
fail
to
make
any
impression
upon
me
for
they
are
reasons
and
nothing
more
than
reasons
and
it
is
not
with
reasons
that
the
heart
is
appeased
i
do
not
want
to
die
no
i
neither
want
to
die
nor

want

the

you
say
materialism
without

either
our

it

dread
the

i
dread
still
more
the

from

yes
perhaps
this
merits
the

of
materialism
and
if
i
grapple
myself
to
god
with
all
my

it
is

of

let

they
also
call

pride
stinking
pride
leopardi
called
it

they
ask
us
who

vile
earthworms
to
pretend
to

in

of

wherefore
by
what
right
in

in

live
wherefore
and
wherefore
do
we
now
exist
by
what
right
and
by
what
right
are
we
to
exist
is
just
as
gratuitous
as
to
go
on
existing
for
ever
do
not
let
us
talk
of
merit
or
of

of
the

of

we

it

with
obermann
for
the
universe
nothing
for
myself
everything
pride
is
it
pride
to
want
to
be
immortal
unhappy
men
that
we
are
is
a
tragic
fate
without
a
doubt
to
have
to
base
the
affirmation
of
immortality
upon
the
insecure
and
slippery
foundation
of
the
desire
for
immortality
but
to
condemn
this
desire
on
the
ground
that
we
believe
it
to
have
been
proved
to
be
unattainable
without
undertaking
the
proof
is
merely
supine
i
am
dreaming
let
me
dream
if
this
dream
is
my
life
do
not
awaken
me
from
it
i
believe
in
the
immortal
origin
of
this
yearning
for
immortality
which
is
the
very
substance
of
my
soul
but
do
i
really
believe
in
it
and
wherefore
do
you
want
to
be
immortal
you
ask
me
wherefore
frankly
i
do
not
understand
the
question
for
it
is
to
ask
the
reason
of
the
reason
the
end
of
the
end
the
principle
of
the
principle
but
these
are
things
which
it
is
impossible
to
discuss
it
is
related
in
the
book
of
the
acts
of
the
apostles
how
wherever
paul
went
the
jews
moved
with
envy
were
stirred
up
to
persecute
him
they
stoned
him
in
iconium
and
lystra
cities
of
lycaonia
in
spite
of
the
wonders
that
he
worked
therein
they
scourged
him
in
philippi
of
macedonia
and
persecuted
his
brethren
in
thessalonica
and
berea
he
arrived
at
athens
however
the
noble
city
of
the
intellectuals
over
which
brooded
the
sublime
spirit
of
plato
the
plato
of
the
gloriousness
of
the
risk
of
immortality
and
there
paul
disputed
with
epicureans
and
stoics
and
some
said
of
him
what
doth
this
babbler
mean
and
others
he
seemeth
to
be
a
setter
forth
of
strange
gods
acts
xvii
and
they
took
him
and
brought
him
unto
areopagus
saying
may
we
know
what
this
new
doctrine
whereof
thou
speakest
is
for
thou
bringest
certain
strange
things
to
our
ears
we
would
know
therefore
what
these
things
mean
verses
and
then
follows
that
wonderful
characterization
of
those
athenians
of
the
decadence
those
dainty
connoisseurs
of
the
curious
for
all
the
athenians
and
strangers
which
were
there
spent
their
time
in
nothing
else
but
either
to
tell
or
to
hear
some
new
thing
verse
a
wonderful
stroke
which
depicts
for
us
the
condition
of
mind
of
those
who
had
learned
from
the
that
the
gods
plot
and
achieve
the
destruction
of
mortals
in
order
that
their
posterity
may
have
something
to
narrate
here
paul
stands
then
before
the
subtle
athenians
before
the
men
of
culture
and
tolerance
who
are
ready
to
welcome
and
examine
every
doctrine
who
neither
stone
nor
scourge
nor
imprison
any
man
for
professing
these
or
those
doctrines
here
he
stands
where
liberty
of
conscience
is
respected
and
every
opinion
is
given
an
attentive
hearing
and
he
raises
his
voice
in
the
midst
of
the
areopagus
and
speaks
to
them
as
it
was
fitting
to
speak
to
the
cultured
citizens
of
athens
and
all
listen
to
him
agog
to
hear
the
latest
novelty
but
when
he
begins
to
speak
to
them
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
their
stock
of
patience
and
tolerance
comes
to
an
end
and
some
mock
him
and
others
say
we
will
hear
thee
again
of
this
matter
intending
not
to
hear
him
and
a
similar
thing
happened
to
him
at
cæsarea
when
he
came
before
the
roman
prætor
felix
likewise
a
and
cultured
man
who
mitigated
the
hardships
of
his
imprisonment
and
wished
to
hear
and
did
hear
him
discourse
of
righteousness
and
of
temperance
but
when
he
spoke
of
the
judgement
to
come
felix
said
terrified
go
thy
way
for
this
time
when
i
have
a
convenient
season
i
will
call
for
thee
acts
xxiv
and
in
his
audience
before
king
agrippa
when
festus
the
governor
heard
him
speak
of
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
he
exclaimed
thou
art
mad
paul
much
learning
hath
made
thee
mad
acts
xxvi
whatever
of
truth
there
may
have
been
in
paul
discourse
in
the
areopagus
and
even
if
there
were
none
it
is
certain
that
this
admirable
account
plainly
shows
how
far
attic
tolerance
goes
and
where
the
patience
of
the
intellectuals
ends
they
all
listen
to
you
calmly
and
smilingly
and
at
times
they
encourage
you
saying
strange
or
he
has
brains
or
that
suggestive
or
how
fine
or
pity
that
a
thing
so
beautiful
should
not
be
true
or
this
makes
one
think
but
as
soon
as
you
speak
to
them
of
resurrection
and
life
after
death
they
lose
their
patience
and
cut
short
your
remarks
and
exclaim
enough
of
this
we
will
talk
about
this
another
day
and
it
is
about
this
my
poor
athenians
my
intolerant
intellectuals
it
is
about
this
that
i
am
going
to
talk
to
you
here
and
even
if
this
belief
be
absurd
why
is
its
exposition
less
tolerated
than
that
of
others
much
more
absurd
why
this
manifest
hostility
to
such
a
belief
is
it
fear
is
it
perhaps
spite
provoked
by
inability
to
share
it
and
sensible
men
those
who
do
not
intend
to
let
themselves
be
deceived
keep
on
dinning
into
our
ears
the
refrain
that
it
is
no
use
giving
way
to
folly
and
kicking
against
the
pricks
for
what
can
not
be
is
impossible
the
manly
attitude
they
say
is
to
resign
oneself
to
fate
since
we
are
not
immortal
do
not
let
us
want
to
be
so
let
us
submit
ourselves
to
reason
without
tormenting
ourselves
about
what
is
irremediable
and
so
making
life
more
gloomy
and
miserable
this
obsession
they
add
is
a
disease
disease
madness
reason
the
everlasting
refrain
very
well
then
no
i
do
not
submit
to
reason
and
i
rebel
against
it
and
i
persist
in
creating
by
the
energy
of
faith
my
immortalizing
god
and
in
forcing
by
my
will
the
stars
out
of
their
courses
for
if
we
had
faith
as
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
we
should
say
to
that
mountain
remove
hence
and
it
would
remove
and
nothing
would
be
impossible
to
us
matt
xvii
there
you
have
that
thief
of
energies
as
he
so
obtusely
called
christ
who
sought
to
wed
nihilism
with
the
struggle
for
existence
and
he
talks
to
you
about
courage
his
heart
craved
the
eternal
all
while
his
head
convinced
him
of
nothingness
and
desperate
and
mad
to
defend
himself
from
himself
he
cursed
that
which
he
most
loved
because
he
could
not
be
christ
he
blasphemed
against
christ
bursting
with
his
own
self
he
wished
himself
unending
and
dreamed
his
theory
of
eternal
recurrence
a
sorry
counterfeit
of
immortality
and
full
of
pity
for
himself
he
abominated
all
pity
and
there
are
some
who
say
that
his
is
the
philosophy
of
strong
men
no
it
is
not
my
health
and
my
strength
urge
me
to
perpetuate
myself
his
is
the
doctrine
of
weaklings
who
aspire
to
be
strong
but
not
of
the
strong
who
are
strong
only
the
feeble
resign
themselves
to
final
death
and
substitute
some
other
desire
for
the
longing
for
personal
immortality
in
the
strong
the
zeal
for
perpetuity
overrides
the
doubt
of
realizing
it
and
their
superabundance
of
life
overflows
upon
the
other
side
of
death
before
this
terrible
mystery
of
mortality
face
to
face
with
the
sphinx
man
adopts
different
attitudes
and
seeks
in
various
ways
to
console
himself
for
having
been
born
and
now
it
occurs
to
him
to
take
it
as
a
diversion
and
he
says
to
himself
with
renan
that
this
universe
is
a
spectacle
that
god
presents
to
himself
and
that
it
behoves
us
to
carry
out
the
intentions
of
the
great
and
contribute
to
make
the
spectacle
the
most
brilliant
and
the
most
varied
that
may
be
and
they
have
made
a
religion
of
art
a
cure
for
the
metaphysical
evil
and
invented
the
meaningless
phrase
of
art
for
art
sake
and
it
does
not
suffice
them
if
the
man
who
tells
you
that
he
writes
paints
sculptures
or
sings
for
his
own
amusement
gives
his
work
to
the
public
he
lies
he
lies
if
he
puts
his
name
to
his
writing
painting
statue
or
song
he
wishes
at
the
least
to
leave
behind
a
shadow
of
his
spirit
something
that
may
survive
him
if
the
of
is
anonymous
it
is
because
its
author
sought
the
eternity
of
the
soul
and
did
not
trouble
himself
about
that
of
the
name
the
man
of
letters
who
shall
tell
you
that
he
despises
fame
is
a
lying
rascal
of
dante
the
author
of
those
vigorous
verses
xi
on
the
vanity
of
worldly
glory
boccaccio
says
that
he
relished
honours
and
pomps
more
perhaps
than
suited
with
his
conspicuous
virtue
the
keenest
desire
of
his
condemned
souls
is
that
they
may
be
remembered
and
talked
of
here
on
earth
and
this
is
the
chief
solace
that
lightens
the
darkness
of
his
inferno
and
he
himself
confessed
that
his
aim
in
expounding
the
concept
of
monarchy
was
not
merely
that
he
might
be
of
service
to
others
but
that
he
might
win
for
his
own
glory
the
palm
of
so
great
prize
lib
cap
what
more
even
of
that
holy
man
seemingly
the
most
indifferent
to
worldly
vanity
the
poor
little
one
of
assisi
it
is
related
in
the
trium
that
he
said
adorabor
per
totum
mundum
you
will
see
how
i
shall
yet
be
adored
by
all
the
world
ii
i
and
even
of
god
himself
the
theologians
say
that
he
created
the
world
for
the
manifestation
of
his
glory
when
doubts
invade
us
and
cloud
our
faith
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
a
vigorous
and
painful
impulse
is
given
to
the
anxiety
to
perpetuate
our
name
and
fame
to
grasp
at
least
a
shadow
of
immortality
and
hence
this
tremendous
struggle
to
singularize
ourselves
to
survive
in
some
way
in
the
memory
of
others
and
of
posterity
it
is
this
struggle
a
thousand
times
more
terrible
than
the
struggle
for
life
that
gives
its
tone
colour
and
character
to
our
society
in
which
the
medieval
faith
in
the
immortal
soul
is
passing
away
each
one
seeks
to
affirm
himself
if
only
in
appearance
once
the
needs
of
hunger
are
satisfied
and
they
are
soon
satisfied
the
vanity
the
necessity
for
it
is
a
necessity
arises
of
imposing
ourselves
upon
and
surviving
in
others
man
habitually
sacrifices
his
life
to
his
purse
but
he
sacrifices
his
purse
to
his
vanity
he
boasts
even
of
his
weaknesses
and
his
misfortunes
for
want
of
anything
better
to
boast
of
and
is
like
a
child
who
in
order
to
attract
attention
struts
about
with
a
bandaged
finger
and
vanity
what
is
it
but
eagerness
for
survival
the
vain
man
is
in
like
case
with
the
avaricious
he
takes
the
means
for
the
end
forgetting
the
end
he
pursues
the
means
for
its
own
sake
and
goes
no
further
the
seeming
to
be
something
conducive
to
being
it
ends
by
forming
our
objective
we
need
that
others
should
believe
in
our
superiority
to
them
in
order
that
we
may
believe
in
it
ourselves
and
upon
their
belief
base
our
faith
in
our
own
persistence
or
at
least
in
the
persistence
of
our
fame
we
are
more
grateful
to
him
who
congratulates
us
on
the
skill
with
which
we
defend
a
cause
than
we
are
to
him
who
recognizes
the
truth
or
the
goodness
of
the
cause
itself
a
rabid
mania
for
originality
is
rife
in
the
modern
intellectual
world
and
characterizes
all
individual
effort
we
would
rather
err
with
genius
than
hit
the
mark
with
the
crowd
rousseau
has
said
in
his
book
iv
even
though
philosophers
should
be
in
a
position
to
discover
the
truth
which
of
them
would
take
any
interest
in
it
each
one
knows
well
that
his
system
is
not
better
founded
than
the
others
but
he
supports
it
because
it
is
his
there
is
not
a
single
one
of
them
who
if
he
came
to
know
the
true
and
the
false
would
not
prefer
the
falsehood
that
he
had
found
to
the
truth
discovered
by
another
where
is
the
philosopher
who
would
not
willingly
deceive
mankind
for
his
own
glory
where
is
he
who
in
the
secret
of
his
heart
does
not
propose
to
himself
any
other
object
than
to
distinguish
himself
provided
that
he
lifts
himself
above
the
vulgar
provided
that
he
outshines
the
brilliance
of
his
competitors
what
does
he
demand
more
the
essential
thing
is
to
think
differently
from
others
with
believers
he
is
an
atheist
with
atheists
he
would
be
a
believer
how
much
substantial
truth
there
is
in
these
gloomy
confessions
of
this
man
of
painful
sincerity
this
violent
struggle
for
the
perpetuation
of
our
name
extends
backwards
into
the
past
just
as
it
aspires
to
conquer
the
future
we
contend
with
the
dead
because
we
the
living
are
obscured
beneath
their
shadow
we
are
jealous
of
the
geniuses
of
former
times
whose
names
standing
out
like
the
landmarks
of
history
rescue
the
ages
from
oblivion
the
heaven
of
fame
is
not
very
large
and
the
more
there
are
who
enter
it
the
less
is
the
share
of
each
the
great
names
of
the
past
rob
us
of
our
place
in
it
the
space
which
they
fill
in
the
popular
memory
they
usurp
from
us
who
aspire
to
occupy
it
and
so
we
rise
up
in
revolt
against
them
and
hence
the
bitterness
with
which
all
those
who
seek
after
fame
in
the
world
of
letters
judge
those
who
have
already
attained
it
and
are
in
enjoyment
of
it
if
additions
continue
to
be
made
to
the
wealth
of
literature
there
will
come
a
day
of
sifting
and
each
one
fears
lest
he
be
caught
in
the
meshes
of
the
sieve
in
attacking
the
masters
irreverent
youth
is
only
defending
itself
the
iconoclast
or
is
a
stylite
who
erects
himself
as
an
image
an
comparisons
are
odious
says
the
familiar
adage
and
the
reason
is
that
we
wish
to
be
unique
do
not
tell
fernandez
that
he
is
one
of
the
most
talented
spaniards
of
the
younger
generation
for
though
he
will
affect
to
be
gratified
by
the
eulogy
he
is
really
annoyed
by
it
if
however
you
tell
him
that
he
is
the
most
talented
man
in
spain
well
and
good
but
even
that
is
not
sufficient
one
of
the
worldwide
reputations
would
be
more
to
his
liking
but
he
is
only
fully
satisfied
with
being
esteemed
the
first
in
all
countries
and
all
ages
the
more
alone
the
nearer
to
that
unsubstantial
immortality
the
immortality
of
the
name
for
great
names
diminish
one
another
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
irritation
which
we
feel
when
we
believe
that
we
are
robbed
of
a
phrase
or
a
thought
or
an
image
which
we
believed
to
be
our
own
when
we
are
plagiarized
robbed
can
it
indeed
be
ours
once
we
have
given
it
to
the
public
only
because
it
is
ours
we
prize
it
and
we
are
fonder
of
the
false
money
that
preserves
our
impress
than
of
the
coin
of
pure
gold
from
which
our
effigy
and
our
legend
has
been
effaced
it
very
commonly
happens
that
it
is
when
the
name
of
a
writer
is
no
longer
in
men
mouths
that
he
most
influences
his
public
his
mind
being
then
disseminated
and
infused
in
the
minds
of
those
who
have
read
him
whereas
he
was
quoted
chiefly
when
his
thoughts
and
sayings
clashing
with
those
generally
received
needed
the
guarantee
of
a
name
what
was
his
now
belongs
to
all
and
he
lives
in
all
but
for
him
the
garlands
have
faded
and
he
believes
himself
to
have
failed
he
hears
no
more
either
the
applause
or
the
silent
tremor
of
the
heart
of
those
who
go
on
reading
him
ask
any
sincere
artist
which
he
would
prefer
whether
that
his
work
should
perish
and
his
memory
survive
or
that
his
work
should
survive
and
his
memory
perish
and
you
will
see
what
he
will
tell
you
if
he
is
really
sincere
when
a
man
does
not
work
merely

he

in

to
work
for
the

sake
is
not
work
but
play
and
play
we
will
talk
about
that
later
on
a
tremendous
passion
is
this
longing
that
our
memory
may
be
rescued
if
it
is
possible
from
the
oblivion
which
overtakes
others
from
it
springs
envy
the
cause
according
to
the
biblical
narrative
of
the
crime
with
which
human
history
opened
the
murder
of
abel
by
his
brother
cain
it
was
not
a
struggle
for
bread
it
was
a
struggle
to
survive
in
god
in
the
divine
memory
envy
is
a
thousand
times
more
terrible
than
hunger
for
it
is
spiritual
hunger
if
what
we
call
the
problem
of
life
the
problem
of
bread
were
once
solved
the
earth
would
be
turned
into
a
hell
by
the
emergence
in
a
more
violent
form
of
the
struggle
for
survival
for
the
sake
of
a
name
man
is
ready
to
sacrifice
not
only
life
but
happiness
life
as
a

and
the

together
with
his

and
there
are
some
who
covet
even
the

for
the
sake
of
acquiring
fame
even
though
it
be
an
infamous
fame
malæ
as
tacitus
says
and
this
erostratism
what
is
it
at
bottom
but
the
longing
for
immortality
if
not
for
substantial
and
concrete
immortality
at
any
rate
for
the
shadowy
immortality
of
the
name
and
in
this
there
are
degrees
if
a
man
despises
the
applause
of
the
crowd
of
it
is
because
he
seeks
to
survive
in
renewed
minorities
for
generations
posterity
is
an
accumulation
of
minorities
said
gounod
he
wishes
to
prolong
himself
in
time
rather
than
in
space
the
crowd
soon
overthrows
its
own
idols
and
the
statue
lies
broken
at
the
foot
of
the
pedestal
without
anyone
heeding
it
but
those
who
win
the
hearts
of
the
elect
will
long
be
the
objects
of
a
fervent
worship
in
some
shrine
small
and
secluded
no
doubt
but
capable
of
preserving
them
from
the
flood
of
oblivion
the
artist
sacrifices
the
extensiveness
of
his
fame
to
its
duration
he
is
anxious
rather
to
endure
for
ever
in
some
little
corner
than
to
occupy
a
brilliant
second
place
in
the
whole
universe
he
prefers
to
be
an
atom
eternal
and
conscious
of
himself
rather
than
to
be
for
a
brief
moment
the
consciousness
of
the
whole
universe
he
sacrifices
infinitude
to
eternity
and
they
keep
on
wearying
our
ears
with
this
chorus
of
pride
stinking
pride
pride
to
wish
to
leave
an
ineffaceable
name
pride
it
is
like
calling
the
thirst
for
riches
a
thirst
for
pleasure
no
it
is
not
so
much
the
longing
for
pleasure
that
drives
us
poor
folk
to
seek
money
as
the
terror
of
poverty
just
as
it
was
not
the
desire
for
glory
but
the
terror
of
hell
that
drove
men
in
the
middle
ages
to
the
cloister
with
its
neither
is
this
wish
to
leave
a
name
pride
but
terror
of
extinction
we
aim
at
being
all
because
in
that
we
see
the
only
means
of
escaping
from
being
nothing
we
wish
to
save
our
memory
at
any
rate
our
memory
how
long
will
it
last
at
most
as
long
as
the
human
race
lasts
and
what
if
we
shall
save
our
memory
in
god
unhappy
i
know
well
are
these
confessions
but
from
the
depth
of
unhappiness
springs
new
life
and
only
by
draining
the
lees
of
spiritual
sorrow
can
we
at
last
taste
the
honey
that
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
cup
of
life
anguish
leads
us
to
consolation
this
thirst
for
eternal
life
is
appeased
by
many
especially
by
the
simple
at
the
fountain
of
religious
faith
but
to
drink
of
this
is
not
given
to
all
the
institution
whose
primordial
end
is
to
protect
this
faith
in
the
personal
immortality
of
the
soul
is
catholicism
but
catholicism
has
sought
to
rationalize
this
faith
by
converting
religion
into
theology
by
offering
a
philosophy
and
a
philosophy
of
the
thirteenth
century
as
a
basis
for
vital
belief
this
and
its
consequences
we
will
now
proceed
to
examine
footnotes
each
time
that
i
consider
that
it
is
my

to

iv
the
essence
of
catholicism
let
us
now
approach
the
christian
catholic
pauline
or
athanasian
solution
of
our
inward
vital
problem
the
hunger
of
immortality
christianity
sprang
from
the
confluence
of
two
mighty
spiritual
streams
the
one
judaic
the
other
hellenic
each
of
which
had
already
influenced
the
other
and
rome
finally
gave
it
a
practical
stamp
and
social
permanence
it
has
been
asserted
perhaps
somewhat
precipitately
that
primitive
christianity
was
that
faith
in
another
life
after
death
is
not
clearly
manifested
in
it
but
rather
a
belief
in
the
proximate
end
of
the
world
and
establishment
of
the
kingdom
of
god
a
belief
known
as
chiliasm
but
were
they
not
fundamentally
one
and
the
same
thing
faith
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
nature
of
which
was
not
perhaps
very
precisely
defined
may
be
said
to
be
a
kind
of
tacit
understanding
or
supposition
underlying
the
whole
of
the
gospel
and
it
is
the
mental
orientation
of
many
of
those
who
read
it
an
orientation
contrary
to
that
of
the
christians
from
among
whom
the
gospel
sprang
that
prevents
them
from
seeing
this
without
doubt
all
that
about
the
second
coming
of
christ
when
he
shall
come
among
the
clouds
clothed
with
majesty
and
great
power
to
judge
the
quick
and
the
dead
to
open
to
some
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
to
cast
others
into
gehenna
where
there
shall
be
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth
may
be
understood
in
a
chiliastic
sense
and
it
is
even
said
of
christ
in
the
gospel
mark
ix
i
that
there
were
with
him
some
who
should
not
taste
of
death
till
they
had
seen
the
kingdom
of
god
that
is
that
the
kingdom
should
come
during
their
generation
and
in
the
same
chapter
verse
it
is
said
of
peter
and
james
and
john
who
went
up
with
jesus
to
the
mount
of
transfiguration
and
heard
him
say
that
he
would
rise
again
from
the
dead
that
they
kept
that
saying
within
themselves
questioning
one
with
another
what
the
rising
from
the
dead
should
mean
and
at
all
events
the
gospel
was
written
when
this
belief
the
basis
and
of
christianity
was
in
process
of
formation
see
matt
xxii
mark
xii
luke
xvi
xx
john
vi
viii
xi
xiv
and
above
all
that
passage
in
matt
xxvii
which
tells
how
at
the
resurrection
of
christ
many
bodies
of
the
saints
which
slept
arose
and
this
was
not
a
natural
resurrection
no
the
christian
faith
was
born
of
the
faith
that
jesus
did
not
remain
dead
but
that
god
raised
him
up
again
and
that
this
resurrection
was
a
fact
but
this
did
not
presuppose
a
mere
immortality
of
the
soul
in
the
philosophical
sense
see
harnack
prolegomena
for
the
first
fathers
of
the
church
themselves
the
immortality
of
the
soul
was
not
a
thing
pertaining
to
the
natural
order
the
teaching
of
the
divine
scriptures
as
nimesius
said
sufficed
for
its
demonstration
and
it
was
according
to
lactantius
a
gift
and
as
such
gratuitous
of
god
but
more
of
this
later
christianity
sprang
as
we
have
said
from
two
great
spiritual
streams
the
judaic
and
the
hellenic
each
one
of
which
had
arrived
on
its
account
if
not
at
a
precise
definition
of
at
any
rate
at
a
definite
yearning
for
another
life
among
the
jews
faith
in
another
life
was
neither
general
nor
clear
but
they
were
led
to
it
by
faith
in
a
personal
and
living
god
the
formation
of
which
faith
comprises
all
their
spiritual
history
jahwé
the
judaic
god
began
by
being
one
god
among
many
others
the
god
of
the
people
of
israel
revealed
among
the
thunders
of
the
tempest
on
mount
sinai
but
he
was
so
jealous
that
he
demanded
that
worship
should
be
paid
to
him
alone
and
it
was
by
way
of
monocultism
that
the
jews
arrived
at
monotheism
he
was
adored
as
a
living
force
not
as
a
metaphysical
entity
and
he
was
the
god
of
battles
but
this
god
of
social
and
martial
origin
to
whose
genesis
we
shall
have
to
return
later
became
more
inward
and
personal
in
the
prophets
and
in
becoming
more
inward
and
personal
he
thereby
became
more
individual
and
more
universal
he
is
the
jahwé
who
instead
of
loving
israel
because
israel
is
his
son
takes
israel
for
a
son
because
he
loves
him
hosea
xi
and
faith
in
the
personal
god
in
the
father
of
men
carries
with
it
faith
in
the
eternalization
of
the
individual
man
a
faith
which
had
already
dawned
in
pharisaism
even
before
christ
hellenic
culture
on
its
side
ended
by
discovering
death
and
to
discover
death
is
to
discover
the
hunger
of
immortality
this
longing
does
not
appear
in
the
homeric
poems
which
are
not
initial
but
final
in
their
character
marking
not
the
start
but
the
close
of
a
civilization
they
indicate
the
transition
from
the
old
religion
of
nature
of
zeus
to
the
more
spiritual
religion
of
apollo
of
redemption
but
the
popular
and
inward
religion
of
the
eleusinian
mysteries
the
worship
of
souls
and
ancestors
always
persisted
underneath
in
so
far
as
it
is
possible
to
speak
of
a
delphic
theology
among
its
more
important
elements
must
be
counted
the
belief
in
the
continuation
of
the
life
of
souls
after
death
in
its
popular
forms
and
in
the
worship
of
the
souls
of
the
dead
there
were
the
titanic
and
the
dionysiac
elements
and
it
was
the
duty
of
man
according
to
the
orphic
doctrine
to
free
himself
from
the
fetters
of
the
body
in
which
the
soul
was
like
a
captive
in
a
prison
see
rohde
die
orphiker
the
nietzschean
idea
of
eternal
recurrence
is
an
orphic
idea
but
the
idea
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
was
not
a
philosophical
principle
the
attempt
of
empedocles
to
harmonize
a
hylozoistic
system
with
spiritualism
proved
that
a
philosophical
natural
science
can
not
by
itself
lead
to
a
corroboration
of
the
axiom
of
the
perpetuity
of
the
individual
soul
it
could
only
serve
as
a
support
to
a
theological
speculation
it
was
by
a
contradiction
that
the
first
greek
philosophers
affirmed
immortality
by
abandoning
natural
philosophy
and
intruding
into
theology
by
formulating
not
an
apollonian
but
a
dionysiac
and
orphic
dogma
but
an
immortality
of
the
soul
as
such
in
virtue
of
its
own
nature
and
condition
as
an
imperishable
divine
force
in
the
mortal
body
was
never
an
object
of
popular
hellenic
belief
rohde
recall
the
of
plato
and
the
lucubrations
in
them
the
yearning
for
personal
immortality
already
shows
itself
a
yearning
which
as
it
was
left
totally
unsatisfied
by
reason
produced
the
hellenic
pessimism
for
as
pfleiderer
very
well
observes
auf
geschichtliche
berlin
no
people
ever
came
upon
the
earth
so
serene
and
sunny
as
the
greeks
in
the
youthful
days
of
their
historical
existence
but
no
people
changed
so
completely
their
idea
of
the
value
of
life
the
hellenism
which
ended
in
the
religious
speculations
of
and
viewed
this
world
which
had
once
appeared
to
it
so
joyous
and
radiant
as
an
abode
of
darkness
and
error
and
earthly
existence
as
a
period
of
trial
which
could
never
be
too
quickly
traversed
nirvana
is
an
hellenic
idea
thus
jews
and
greeks
each
arrived
independently
at
the
real
discovery
of
death
a
discovery
which
occasions
in
peoples
as
in
men
the
entrance
into
spiritual
puberty
the
realization
of
the
tragic
sense
of
life
and
it
is
then
that
the
living
god
is
begotten
by
humanity
the
discovery
of
death
is
that
which
reveals
god
to
us
and
the
death
of
the
perfect
man
christ
was
the
supreme
revelation
of
death
being
the
death
of
the
man
who
ought
not
to
have
died
yet
did
die
such
a
discovery
that
of
immortality
prepared
as
it
was
by
the
judaic
and
hellenic
religious
processes
was
a
specifically
christian
discovery
and
its
full
achievement
was
due
above
all
to
paul
of
tarsus
the
hellenizing
jew
and
pharisee
paul
had
not
personally
known
jesus
and
hence
he
discovered
him
as
christ
it
may
be
said
that
the
theology
of
the
apostle
paul
is
in
general
the
first
christian
theology
for
him
it
was
a
necessity
it
was
in
a
certain
sense
his
substitution
for
the
lack
of
a
personal
knowledge
of
jesus
says
weizsäcker
apostolische
zeitalter
der
christlichen
he
did
not
know
jesus
but
he
felt
him
born
again
in
himself
and
thus
he
could
say
nevertheless
i
live
yet
not
i
but
christ
liveth
in
me
and
he
preached
the
cross
unto
the
jews
a
and
unto
the
greeks
foolishness
i
cor
i
and
the
central
doctrine
for
the
converted
apostle
was
that
of
the
resurrection
of
christ
the
important
thing
for
him
was
that
christ
had
been
made
man
and
had
died
and
had
risen
again
and
not
what
he
did
in
his
life
not
his
ethical
work
as
a
teacher
but
his
religious
work
as
a
giver
of
immortality
and
he
it
was
who
wrote
those
immortal
words
now
if
christ
be
preached
that
he
rose
from
the
dead
how
say
some
among
you
that
there
is
no
resurrection
from
the
dead
but
if
there
be
no
resurrection
of
the
dead
then
is
christ
not
risen
and
if
christ
be
not
risen
then
is
our
preaching
vain
and
your
faith
is
also
vain
then
they
also
which
are
fallen
asleep
in
christ
are
perished
if
in
this
life
only
we
have
hope
in
christ
we
are
of
all
men
most
miserable
i
cor
xv
and
it
is
possible
to
affirm
that
thenceforward
he
who
does
not
believe
in
the
bodily
resurrection
of
christ
may
be
christophile
but
can
not
be
specifically
christian
it
is
true
that
a
justin
martyr
could
say
that
all
those
are
christians
who
live
in
accordance
with
reason
even
though
they
may
be
deemed
to
be
atheists
as
among
the
greeks
socrates
and
heraclitus
and
other
such
but
this
martyr
is
he
a
martyr
that
is
to
say
a
witness
of
christianity
no
and
it
was
around
this
dogma
inwardly
experienced
by
paul
the
dogma
of
the
resurrection
and
immortality
of
christ
the
guarantee
of
the
resurrection
and
immortality
of
each
believer
that
the
whole
of
christology
was
built
up
the
the
incarnate
word
came
in
order
that
man
according
to
his
mode
might
be
made
god
that
is
immortal
and
the
christian
god
the
father
of
christ
a
god
necessarily
anthropomorphic
is
he
who
as
the
catechism
of
christian
doctrine
which
we
were
made
to
learn
by
heart
at
school
says
created
the
world
for
man
for
each
man
and
the
end
of
redemption
in
spite
of
appearances
due
to
an
ethical
deflection
of
a
dogma
properly
religious
was
to
save
us
from
death
rather
than
from
sin
or
from
sin
in
so
far
as
sin
implies
death
and
christ
died
or
rather
rose
again
for
for
each
one
of
us
and
a
certain
solidarity
was
established
between
god
and
his
creature
malebranche
said
that
the
first
man
fell
order
christ
might
redeem
us
rather
than
that
christ
redeemed
us
man
had
fallen
after
the
death
of
paul
years
passed
and
generations
of
christianity
wrought
upon
this
central
dogma
and
its
consequences
in
order
to
safeguard
faith
in
the
immortality
of
the
individual
soul
and
the
council
of
nicæa
came
and
with
it
the
formidable
athanasius
whose
name
is
still
a
an
incarnation
of
the
popular
faith
athanasius
was
a
man
of
little
learning
but
of
great
faith
and
above
all
of
popular
faith
devoured
by
the
hunger
of
immortality
and
he
opposed
arianism
which
like
unitarian
and
socinian
protestantism
threatened
although
unknowingly
and
unintentionally
the
foundation
of
that
belief
for
the
arians
christ
was
first
and
foremost
a
teacher
a
teacher
of
morality
the
wholly
perfect
man
and
therefore
the
guarantee
that
we
may
all
attain
to
supreme
perfection
but
athanasius
felt
that
christ
can
not
make
us
gods
if
he
has
not
first
made
himself
god
if
his
divinity
had
been
communicated
he
could
not
have
communicated
it
to
us
he
was
not
therefore
he
said
first
man
and
then
became
god
but
he
was
first
god
and
then
became
man
in
order
that
he
might
the
better
deify
us
i
it
was
not
the
logos
of
the
philosophers
the
cosmological
logos
that
athanasius
knew
and
adored
and
thus
he
instituted
a
separation
between
nature
and
revelation
the
athanasian
or
nicene
christ
who
is
the
catholic
christ
is
not
the
cosmological
nor
even
strictly
the
ethical
christ
he
is
the
eternalizing
the
deifying
the
religious
christ
harnack
says
of
this
christ
the
christ
of
nicene
or
catholic
christology
that
he
is
essentially
docetic
that
is
apparential
because
the
process
of
the
divinization
of
the
man
in
christ
was
made
in
the
interests
of
eschatology
but
which
is
the
real
christ
is
it
indeed
that
historical
christ
of
rationalist
exegesis
who
is
diluted
for
us
in
a
myth
or
in
a
social
atom
this
same
harnack
a
protestant
rationalist
tells
us
that
arianism
or
unitarianism
would
have
been
the
death
of
christianity
reducing
it
to
cosmology
and
ethics
and
that
it
served
only
as
a
bridge
whereby
the
learned
might
pass
over
to
catholicism
that
is
to
say
from
reason
to
faith
to
this
same
learned
historian
of
dogmas
it
appears
to
be
an
indication
of
a
perverse
state
of
things
that
the
man
athanasius
who
saved
christianity
as
the
religion
of
a
living
communion
with
god
should
have
obliterated
the
jesus
of
nazareth
the
historical
jesus
whom
neither
paul
nor
athanasius
knew
personally
nor
yet
harnack
himself
among
protestants
this
historical
jesus
is
subjected
to
the
scalpel
of
criticism
while
the
catholic
christ
lives
the
really
historical
christ
he
who
lives
throughout
the
centuries
guaranteeing
the
faith
in
personal
immortality
and
personal
salvation
and
athanasius
had
the
supreme
audacity
of
faith
that
of
asserting
things
mutually
contradictory
the
complete
contradiction
that
exists
in
the
carried
in
its
train
a
whole
army
of
contradictions
which
increased
as
thought
advanced
says
harnack
yes
so
it
was
and
so
it
had
to
be
and
he
adds
dogma
took
leave
for
ever
of
clear
thinking
and
tenable
concepts
and
habituated
itself
to
the
in
truth
it
drew
closer
to
life
which
is
and
opposed
to
clear
thinking
not
only
are
judgements
of
worth
never
rationalizable
they
are
at
nicæa
then
as
afterwards
at
the
vatican
victory
rested
with
the
idiots
taking
this
word
in
its
proper
primitive
and
etymological
sense
the
the
rude
and
headstrong
bishops
the
representatives
of
the
genuine
human
spirit
the
popular
spirit
the
spirit
that
does
not
want
to
die
in
spite
of
whatever
reason
may
say
and
that
seeks
a
guarantee
the
most
material
possible
for
this
desire
ad
æternitatem
this
is
the
capital
question
and
the
creed
ends
with
that
phrase
mortuorum
et
vitam
venturi
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
and
the
life
of
the
world
to
come
in
the
cemetery
of
mallona
in
my
native
town
of
bilbao
there
is
a
tombstone
on
which
this
verse
is
carved
estamos
en
polvo
convertidos
en
ti
señor
nuestra
esperanza
fía
que
tornaremos
a
vivir
vestidos
con
la
carne
y
la
piel
que
nos
with
the
same
bodies
and
souls
that
they
had
as
the
catechism
says
so
much
so
that
it
is
orthodox
catholic
doctrine
that
the
happiness
of
the
blessed
is
not
perfectly
complete
until
they
recover
their
bodies
they
lament
in
heaven
says
our
brother
pedro
malón
de
chaide
of
the
order
of
augustine
a
spaniard
and
a
basque
and
this
lament
springs
from
their
not
being
perfectly
whole
in
heaven
for
only
the
soul
is
there
and
although
they
can
not
suffer
because
they
see
god
in
whom
they
unspeakably
delight
yet
with
all
this
it
appears
that
they
are
not
wholly
content
they
will
be
so
when
they
are
clothed
with
their
own
bodies
and
to
this
central
dogma
of
the
resurrection
in
christ
and
by
christ
corresponds
likewise
a
central
sacrament
the
axis
of
popular
catholic
piety
the
sacrament
of
the
eucharist
in
it
is
administered
the
body
of
christ
which
is
the
bread
of
immortality
this
sacrament
is
genuinely
realist
as
the
germans
would
say
which
may
without
great
violence
be
translated
material
it
is
the
sacrament
most
genuinely
opere
for
which
is
substituted
among
protestants
the
idealistic
sacrament
of
the
word
fundamentally
it
is
concerned
with
and
i
say
it
with
all
possible
respect
but
without
wishing
to
sacrifice
the
expressiveness
of
the
phrase
the
eating
and
drinking
of
god
the
eternalizer
the
feeding
upon
him
little
wonder
then
if
teresa
tells
us
that
when
she
was
communicating
in
the
monastery
of
the
incarnation
and
in
the
second
year
of
her
being
prioress
there
on
the
octave
of
martin
and
the
father
fr
juan
de
la
cruz
divided
the
host
between
her
and
another
sister
she
thought
that
it
was
done
not
because
there
was
any
want
of
hosts
but
because
he
wished
to
mortify
her
for
i
had
told
him
how
much
i
delighted
in
hosts
of
a
large
size
yet
i
was
not
ignorant
that
the
size
of
the
host
is
of
no
moment
for
i
knew
that
our
lord
is
whole
and
entire
in
the
smallest
particle
here
reason
pulls
one
way
feeling
another
and
what
importance
for
this
feeling
have
the
thousand
and
one
difficulties
that
arise
from
reflecting
rationally
upon
the
mystery
of
this
sacrament
what
is
a
divine
body
and
the
body
in
so
far
as
it
is
the
body
of
christ
is
it
divine
what
is
an
immortal
and
immortalizing
body
what
is
substance
separated
from
the
accidents
nowadays
we
have
greatly
refined
our
notion
of
materiality
and
substantiality
but
there
were
even
some
among
the
fathers
of
the
church
to
whom
the
immateriality
of
god
himself
was
not
a
thing
so
clear
and
definite
as
it
is
for
us
and
this
sacrament
of
the
eucharist
is
the
immortalizing
sacrament
and
therefore
the
axis
of
popular
catholic
piety
and
if
it
may
be
so
said
the
most
specifically
religious
of
sacraments
for
what
is
specific
in
the
catholic
religion
is
immortalization
and
not
justification
in
the
protestant
sense
rather
is
this
latter
ethical
it
was
from
kant
in
spite
of
what
orthodox
protestants
may
think
of
him
that
protestantism
derived
its
penultimate
conclusions
namely
that
religion
rests
upon
morality
and
not
morality
upon
religion
as
in
catholicism
the
preoccupation
of
sin
has
never
been
such
a
matter
of
anguish
or
at
any
rate
has
never
displayed
itself
with
such
an
appearance
of
anguish
among
catholics
the
sacrament
of
confession
contributes
to
this
and
there
persists
perhaps
among
catholics
more
than
among
protestants
the
substance
of
the
primitive
judaic
and
pagan
conception
of
sin
as
something
material
and
infectious
and
hereditary
which
is
cured
by
baptism
and
absolution
in
adam
all
his
posterity
sinned
almost
materially
and
his
sin
was
transmitted
as
a
material
disease
is
transmitted
renan
whose
education
was
catholic
was
right
therefore
in
calling
to
account
the
protestant
amiel
who
accused
him
of
not
giving
due
importance
to
sin
and
on
the
other
hand
protestantism
absorbed
in
this
preoccupation
with
justification
which
in
spite
of
its
religious
guise
was
taken
more
in
an
ethical
sense
than
anything
else
ends
by
neutralizing
and
almost
obliterating
eschatology
it
abandons
the
nicene
symbol
falls
into
an
anarchy
of
creeds
into
pure
religious
individualism
and
a
vague
esthetic
ethical
or
cultured
religiosity
what
we
may
call
was
obliterated
little
by
little
by
and
this
in
spite
of
kant
who
wished
to
save
it
but
by
destroying
it
to
its
earthly
vocation
and
passive
trust
in
god
is
due
the
religious
coarseness
of
lutheranism
which
was
almost
at
the
point
of
expiring
in
the
age
of
the
enlightenment
of
the
and
which
pietism
infusing
into
it
something
of
the
religious
sap
of
catholicism
barely
succeeded
in
galvanizing
a
little
hence
the
exactness
of
the
remarks
of
oliveira
martins
in
his
magnificent
of
iberian
in
which
he
says
book
chap
iii
that
catholicism
produced
heroes
and
protestantism
produced
societies
that
are
sensible
happy
wealthy
free
as
far
as
their
outer
institutions
go
but
incapable
of
any
great
action
because
their
religion
has
begun
by
destroying
in
the
heart
of
man
all
that
made
him
capable
of
daring
and
noble
take
any
of
the
dogmatic
systems
that
have
resulted
from
the
latest
protestant
dissolvent
analysis
that
of
kaftan
the
follower
of
ritschl
for
example
and
note
the
extent
to
which
eschatology
is
reduced
and
his
master
albrecht
ritschl
himself
says
the
question
regarding
the
necessity
of
justification
or
forgiveness
can
only
be
solved
by
conceiving
eternal
life
as
the
direct
end
and
aim
of
that
divine
operation
but
if
the
idea
of
eternal
life
be
applied
merely
to
our
state
in
the
next
life
then
its
content
too
lies
beyond
all
experience
and
can
not
form
the
basis
of
knowledge
of
a
scientific
kind
hopes
and
desires
though
marked
by
the
strongest
subjective
certainty
are
not
any
the
clearer
for
that
and
contain
in
themselves
no
guarantee
of
the
completeness
of
what
one
hopes
or
desires
clearness
and
completeness
of
idea
however
are
the
conditions
of
comprehending
anything
of
understanding
the
necessary
connection
between
the
various
elements
of
a
thing
and
between
the
thing
and
its
given
presuppositions
the
evangelical
article
of
belief
therefore
that
justification
by
faith
establishes
or
brings
with
it
assurance
of
eternal
life
is
of
no
use
theologically
so
long
as
this
purposive
aspect
of
justification
can
not
be
verified
in
such
experience
as
is
possible
now
und
vol
chap
all
this
is
very
rational
but
in
the
first
edition
of
melanchthon
that
of
the
first
lutheran
theological
work
its
author
omits
all
trinitarian
and
christological
speculations
the
dogmatic
basis
of
eschatology
and
hermann
professor
at
marburg
the
author
of
a
book
on
the
commerce
with
god
verkehr
des
christen
mit
a
book
the
first
chapter
of
which
treats
of
the
opposition
between
mysticism
and
the
christian
religion
and
which
is
according
to
harnack
the
most
perfect
lutheran
manual
tells
us
in
another
place
referring
to
this
christological
or
athanasian
speculation
that
the
effective
knowledge
of
god
and
of
christ
in
which
knowledge
faith
lives
is
something
entirely
different
nothing
ought
to
find
a
place
in
christian
doctrine
that
is
not
capable
of
helping
man
to
recognize
his
sins
to
obtain
the
grace
of
god
and
to
serve
him
in
truth
until
that
time
that
is
to
say
until
luther
the
church
had
accepted
much
as
which
can
not
absolutely
contribute
to
confer
upon
man
liberty
of
heart
and
tranquillity
of
conscience
for
my
part
i
can
not
conceive
the
liberty
of
a
heart
or
the
tranquillity
of
a
conscience
that
are
not
sure
of
their
perdurability
after
death
the
desire
for
the
soul
salvation
hermann
continues
must
at
last
have
led
men
to
the
knowledge
and
understanding
of
the
effective
doctrine
of
salvation
and
in
his
book
on
the
christian
commerce
with
god
this
eminent
lutheran
doctor
is
continually
discoursing
upon
trust
in
god
peace
of
conscience
and
an
assurance
of
salvation
that
is
not
strictly
and
precisely
certainty
of
everlasting
life
but
rather
certainty
of
the
forgiveness
of
sins
and
i
have
read
in
a
protestant
theologian
ernst
troeltsch
that
in
the
conceptual
order
protestantism
has
attained
its
highest
reach
in
music
in
which
art
bach
has
given
it
its
mightiest
artistic
expression
this
then
is
what
protestantism
dissolves
into
celestial
music
on
the
other
hand
we
may
say
that
the
highest
artistic
expression
of
catholicism
or
at
least
of
spanish
catholicism
is
in
the
art
that
is
most
material
tangible
and
permanent
for
the
vehicle
of
sounds
is
air
in
sculpture
and
painting
in
the
christ
of
velasquez
that
christ
who
is
for
ever
dying
yet
never
finishes
dying
in
order
that
he
may
give
us
life
and
yet
catholicism
does
not
abandon
ethics
no
no
modern
religion
can
leave
ethics
on
one
side
but
our
religion
although
its
doctors
may
protest
against
this
is
fundamentally
and
for
the
most
part
a
compromise
between
eschatology
and
ethics
it
is
eschatology
pressed
into
the
service
of
ethics
what
else
but
this
is
that
atrocity
of
the
eternal
pains
of
hell
which
agrees
so
ill
with
the
pauline
apocatastasis
let
us
bear
in
mind
those
words
which
the
the
manual
of
mysticism
that
luther
read
puts
into
the
mouth
of
god
if
i
must
recompense
your
evil
i
must
recompense
it
with
good
for
i
am
and
have
none
other
and
christ
said
father
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
and
there
is
no
man
who
perhaps
knows
what
he
does
but
it
has
been
necessary
for
the
benefit
of
the
social
order
to
convert
religion
into
a
kind
of
police
system
and
hence
hell
oriental
or
greek
christianity
is
predominantly
eschatological
protestantism
predominantly
ethical
and
catholicism
is
a
compromise
between
the
two
although
with
the
eschatological
element
preponderating
the
most
authentic
catholic
ethic
monastic
asceticism
is
an
ethic
of
eschatology
directed
to
the
salvation
of
the
individual
soul
rather
than
to
the
maintenance
of
society
and
in
the
cult
of
virginity
may
there
not
perhaps
be
a
certain
obscure
idea
that
to
perpetuate
ourselves
in
others
hinders
our
own
personal
perpetuation
the
ascetic
morality
is
a
negative
morality
and
strictly
what
is
important
for
a
man
is
not
to
die
whether
he
sins
or
not
it
is
not
necessary
to
take
very
literally
but
as
a
lyrical
or
rather
rhetorical
effusion
the
words
of
our
famous
sonnet
me
mueve
mi
dios
para
quererte
el
cielo
que
me
tienes
prometido
and
the
rest
that
follows
the
real
sin
perhaps
it
is
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
for
which
there
is
no
remission
is
the
sin
of
heresy
the
sin
of
thinking
for
oneself
the
saying
has
been
heard
before
now
here
in
spain
that
to
be
a
liberal
that
is
a
heretic
is
worse
than
being
an
assassin
a
thief
or
an
adulterer
the
gravest
sin
is
not
to
obey
the
church
whose
infallibility
protects
us
from
reason
and
why
be
scandalized
by
the
infallibility
of
a
man
of
the
pope
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it
be
a
book
that
is
infallible
the
bible
or
a
society
of
men
the
church
or
a
single
man
does
it
make
any
essential
change
in
the
rational
difficulty
and
since
the
infallibility
of
a
book
or
of
a
society
of
men
is
not
more
rational
than
that
of
a
single
man
this
supreme
offence
in
the
eyes
of
reason
had
to
be
posited
it
is
the
vital
asserting
itself
and
in
order
to
assert
itself
it
creates
with
the
help
of
its
enemy
the
rational
a
complete
dogmatic
structure
and
this
the
church
defends
against
rationalism
against
protestantism
and
against
modernism
the
church
defends
life
it
stood
up
against
galileo
and
it
did
right
for
his
discovery
in
its
inception
and
until
it
became
assimilated
to
the
general
body
of
human
knowledge
tended
to
shatter
the
anthropomorphic
belief
that
the
universe
was
created
for
man
it
opposed
darwin
and
it
did
right
for
darwinism
tends
to
shatter
our
belief
that
man
is
an
exceptional
animal
created
expressly
to
be
eternalized
and
lastly
pius
the
first
pontiff
to
be
proclaimed
infallible
declared
that
he
was
irreconcilable
with
the
modern
civilization
and
he
did
right
loisy
the
catholic
said
i
say
simply
this
that
the
church
and
theology
have
not
looked
with
favour
upon
the
scientific
movement
and
that
on
certain
decisive
occasions
so
far
as
it
lay
in
their
power
they
have
hindered
it
i
say
above
all
that
catholic
teaching
has
not
associated
itself
with
or
accommodated
itself
to
this
movement
theology
has
conducted
itself
and
conducts
itself
still
as
if
it
were
of
a
science
of
nature
and
a
science
of
history
together
with
that
general
philosophy
of
nature
and
history
which
results
from
a
scientific
knowledge
of
them
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
domain
of
theology
and
that
of
science
distinct
in
principle
and
even
as
defined
by
the
vatican
council
must
not
be
distinct
in
practice
everything
proceeds
almost
as
if
theology
had
nothing
to
learn
from
modern
science
natural
or
historical
and
as
if
by
itself
it
had
the
power
and
the
right
to
exercise
a
direct
and
absolute
control
over
all
the
activities
of
the
human
mind
petit
and
such
must
needs
be
and
such
in
fact
is
the
church
attitude
in
its
struggle
with
modernism
of
which
loisy
was
the
learned
and
leading
exponent
the
recent
struggle
against
kantian
and
fideist
modernism
is
a
struggle
for
life
is
it
indeed
possible
for
life
life
that
seeks
assurance
of
survival
to
tolerate
that
a
loisy
a
catholic
priest
should
affirm
that
the
resurrection
of
the
saviour
is
not
a
fact
of
the
historical
order
demonstrable
and
demonstrated
by
the
testimony
of
history
alone
read
moreover
the
exposition
of
the
central
dogma
that
of
the
resurrection
of
jesus
in
le

excellent
work
et
and
tell
me
if
any
solid
ground
is
left
for
our
hope
to
build
on
do
not
the
modernists
see
that
the
question
at
issue
is
not
so
much
that
of
the
immortal
life
of
christ
reduced
perhaps
to
a
life
in
the
collective
christian
consciousness
as
that
of
a
guarantee
of
our
own
personal
resurrection
of
body
as
well
as
soul
this
new
psychological
apologetic
appeals
to
the
moral
miracle
and
we
like
the
jews
seek
for
a
sign
something
that
can
be
taken
hold
of
with
all
the
powers
of
the
soul
and
with
all
the
senses
of
the
body
and
with
the
hands
and
the
feet
and
the
mouth
if
it
be
possible
but
alas
we
do
not
get
it
reason
attacks
and
faith
which
does
not
feel
itself
secure
without
reason
has
to
come
to
terms
with
it
and
hence
come
those
tragic
contradictions
and
lacerations
of
consciousness
we
need
security
certainty
signs
and
they
give
us
motives
of
credibility
upon
which
to
establish
the
and
although
faith
precedes
reason
præcedit
according
to
augustine
this
same
learned
doctor
and
bishop
sought
to
travel
by
faith
to
understanding
fidem
ad
and
to
believe
in
order
to
understand
ut
how
far
is
this
from
that
superb
expression
of
tertullian
sepultus
resurrexit
certum
est
quia
impossibile
est
and
he
was
buried
and
rose
again
it
is
certain
because
it
is
impossible
and
his
sublime
quia
absurdum
the
scandal
of
the
rationalists
how
far
from
the
faut
of
pascal
and
from
the
human
reason
loves
the
absurd
of
our
donoso
cortés
which
he
must
have
learned
from
the
great
joseph
de
maistre
and
a
first
was
sought
in
the
authority
of
tradition
and
the
revelation
of
the
word
of
god
and
the
principle
of
unanimous
consent
was
arrived
at
apud
multos
unum
invenitur
non
est
erratum
sed
said
tertullian
and
lamennais
added
centuries
later
that
certitude
the
principle
of
life
and
intelligence
is
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
a
social
product
but
here
as
in
so
many
cases
the
supreme
formula
was
given
by
that
great
catholic
whose
catholicism
was
of
the
popular
and
vital
order
count
joseph
de
maistre
when
he
wrote
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
possible
to
show
a
single
opinion
of
universal
utility
that
is
not
true
here
you
have
the
catholic
the
deduction
of
the
truth
of
a
principle
from
its
supreme
goodness
or
utility
and
what
is
there
of
greater
of
more
sovereign
utility
than
the
immortality
of
the
soul
as
all
is
uncertain
either
we
must
believe
all
men
or
none
said
lactantius
but
that
great
mystic
and
ascetic
blessed
heinrich
seuse
the
dominican
implored
the
eternal
wisdom
for
one
word
affirming
that
he
was
love
and
when
the
answer
came
all
creatures
proclaim
that
i
am
love
seuse
replied
alas
lord
that
does
not
suffice
for
a
yearning
soul
faith
feels
itself
secure
neither
with
universal
consent
nor
with
tradition
nor
with
authority
it
seeks
the
support
of
its
enemy
reason
and
thus
scholastic
theology
was
devised
and
with
it
its
handmaiden
scholastic
philosophy
and
this
handmaiden
turned
against
her
mistress
scholasticism
a
magnificent
cathedral
in
which
all
the
problems
of
architectonic
mechanism
were
resolved
for
future
ages
but
a
cathedral
constructed
of
unbaked
bricks
gave
place
little
by
little
to
what
is
called
natural
theology
and
is
merely
christianity
depotentialized
the
attempt
was
even
made
where
it
was
possible
to
base
dogmas
upon
reason
to
show
at
least
that
if
they
were
indeed
they
were
not
and
they
were
reinforced
with
a
philosophical
foundation
of
philosophy
and
such
is
the
thomism
recommended
by
leo
xiii
and
now
the
question
is
not
one
of
the
enforcement
of
dogma
but
of
its
philosophical
medieval
and
thomist
interpretation
it
is
not
enough
to
believe
that
in
receiving
the
consecrated
host
we
receive
the
body
and
blood
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
we
must
needs
negotiate
all
those
difficulties
of
transubstantiation
and
substance
separated
from
accidents
and
so
break
with
the
whole
of
the
modern
rational
conception
of
substantiality
but
for
this
implicit
faith
suffices
the
faith
of
the
coalheaver
the
faith
of
those
who
like
teresa
cap
xxv
do
not
wish
to
avail
themselves
of
theology
do
not
ask
me
the
reason
of
that
for
i
am
ignorant
holy
mother
church
possesses
doctors
who
will
know
how
to
answer
you
as
we
were
made
to
learn
in
the
catechism
it
was
for
this
among
other
things
that
the
priesthood
was
instituted
that
the
teaching
church
might
be
the
depositary
reservoir
instead
of
river
as
phillips
brooks
said
of
theological
secrets
the
work
of
the
nicene
creed
says
harnack
ii
cap
vii
was
a
victory
of
the
priesthood
over
the
faith
of
the
christian
people
the
doctrine
of
the
logos
had
already
become
unintelligible
to
those
who
were
not
theologians
the
setting
up
of
the
formula
as
the
fundamental
confession
of
the
church
made
it
perfectly
impossible
for
the
catholic
laity
to
get
an
inner
comprehension
of
the
christian
faith
taking
as
their
guide
the
form
in
which
it
was
presented
in
the
doctrine
of
the
church
the
idea
became
more
and
more
deeply
implanted
in
men
minds
that
christianity
was
the
revelation
of
the
unintelligible
and
so
in
truth
it
is
and
why
was
this
because
faith
that
is
life
no
longer
felt
sure
of
itself
neither
traditionalism
nor
the
theological
positivism
of
duns
scotus
sufficed
for
it
it
sought
to
rationalize
itself
and
it
sought
to
establish
its
foundation
not
indeed
over
against
reason
where
it
really
is
but
upon
reason
that
is
to
say
within
reason
itself
the
nominalist
or
positivist
or
voluntarist
position
of
scotus
that
which
maintains
that
law
and
truth
depend
not
so
much
upon
the
essence
as
upon
the
free
and
inscrutable
will
of
god
by
accentuating
its
supreme
irrationality
placed
religion
in
danger
among
the
majority
of
believers
endowed
with
mature
reason
and
not
mere
coalheavers
hence
the
triumph
of
the
thomist
theological
rationalism
it
is
no
longer
enough
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
god
but
the
sentence
of
anathema
falls
on
him
who
though
believing
in
it
does
not
believe
that
his
existence
is
demonstrable
by
rational
arguments
or
who
believes
that
up
to
the
present
nobody
by
means
of
these
rational
arguments
has
ever
demonstrated
it
irrefutably
however
in
this
connection
the
remark
of
pohle
is
perhaps
capable
of
application
if
eternal
salvation
depended
upon
mathematical
axioms
we
should
have
to
expect
that
the
most
odious
human
sophistry
would
attack
their
universal
validity
as
violently
as
it
now
attacks
god
the
soul
and
christ
the
truth
is
catholicism
oscillates
between
mysticism
which
is
the
inward
experience
of
the
living
god
in
christ
an
intransmittible
experience
the
danger
of
which
however
is
that
it
absorbs
our
own
personality
in
god
and
so
does
not
save
our
vital
longing
between
mysticism
and
the
rationalism
which
it
fights
against
see
weizsäcker
it
oscillates
between
religionized
science
and
scientificized
religion
the
apocalyptic
enthusiasm
changed
little
by
little
into
mysticism
which
theology
thrust
further
into
the
background
it
feared
the
excesses
of
the
imagination
which
was
supplanting
faith
and
creating
gnostic
extravagances
but
it
had
to
sign
a
kind
of
pact
with
gnosticism
and
another
with
rationalism
neither
imagination
nor
reason
allowed
itself
to
be
completely
vanquished
and
thus
the
body
of
catholic
dogma
became
a
system
of
contradictions
more
or
less
successfully
harmonized
the
trinity
was
a
kind
of
pact
between
monotheism
and
polytheism
and
humanity
and
divinity
sealed
a
peace
in
christ
nature
covenanted
with
grace
grace
with
free
will
free
will
with
the
divine
prescience
and
so
on
and
it
is
perhaps
true
as
hermann
says
that
as
soon
as
we
develop
religious
thought
to
its
logical
conclusions
it
enters
into
conflict
with
other
ideas
which
belong
equally
to
the
life
of
religion
and
this
it
is
that
gives
to
catholicism
its
profound
vital
dialectic
but
at
what
a
cost
at
the
cost
it
must
needs
be
said
of
doing
violence
to
the
mental
exigencies
of
those
believers
in
possession
of
an
adult
reason
it
demands
from
them
that
they
shall
believe
all
or
nothing
that
they
shall
accept
the
complete
totality
of
dogma
or
that
they
shall
forfeit
all
merit
if
the
least
part
of
it
be
rejected
and
hence
the
result
as
the
great
unitarian
preacher
channing
pointed
out
that
in
france
and
spain
there
are
multitudes
who
have
proceeded
from
rejecting
popery
to
absolute
atheism
because
the
fact
is
that
false
and
absurd
doctrines
when
exposed
have
a
natural
tendency
to
beget
scepticism
in
those
who
received
them
without
reflection
none
are
so
likely
to
believe
too
little
as
those
who
have
begun
by
believing
too
much
here
is
indeed
the
terrible
danger
of
believing
too
much
but
no
the
terrible
danger
comes
from
another
quarter
from
seeking
to
believe
with
the
reason
and
not
with
life
the
catholic
solution
of
our
problem
of
our
unique
vital
problem
the
problem
of
the
immortality
and
eternal
salvation
of
the
individual
soul
satisfies
the
will
and
therefore
satisfies
life
but
the
attempt
to
rationalize
it
by
means
of
dogmatic
theology
fails
to
satisfy
the
reason
and
reason
has
its
exigencies
as
imperious
as
those
of
life
it
is
no
use
seeking
to
force
ourselves
to
consider
as
what
clearly
appears
to
us
to
be
neither
is
it
any
good
wishing
to
become
coalheavers
when
we
are
not
coalheavers
infallibility
a
notion
of
hellenic
origin

the

david
hume
begins
his
essay
on
the
immortality
of
the
soul
with
these
decisive
words
it
appears
difficult
by
the
mere
light
of
reason
to
prove
the
immortality
of
the
soul
the
arguments
in
favour
of
it
are
commonly
derived
from
metaphysical
moral
or
physical
considerations
but
it
is
really
the
gospel
and
only
the
gospel
that
has
brought
to
light
life
and
immortality
which
is
equivalent
to
denying
the
rationality
of
the
belief
that
the
soul
of
each
one
of
us
is
immortal
kant
whose
criticism
found
its
point
of
departure
in
hume
attempted
to
establish
the
rationality
of
this
longing
for
immortality
and
the
belief
that
it
imports
and
this
is
the
real
origin
the
inward
origin
of
his
of
practical
and
of
his
categorical
imperative
and
of
his
god
but
in
spite
of
all
this
the
sceptical
affirmation
of
hume
holds
good
there
is
no
way
of
proving
the
immortality
of
the
soul
rationally
there
are
on
the
other
hand
ways
of
proving
rationally
its
mortality
it
would
be
not
merely
superfluous
but
ridiculous
to
enlarge
here
upon
the
extent
to
which
the
individual
human
consciousness
is
dependent
upon
the
physical
organism
pointing
out
how
it
comes
to
birth
by
slow
degrees
according
as
the
brain
receives
impressions
from
the
outside
world
how
it
is
temporarily
suspended
during
sleep
swoons
and
other
accidents
and
how
everything
leads
us
to
the
rational
conjecture
that
death
carries
with
it
the
loss
of
consciousness
and
just
as
before
our
birth
we
were
not
nor
have
we
any
personal
memory
so
after
our
death
we
shall
cease
to
be
this
is
the
rational
position
the
designation
soul
is
merely
a
term
used
to
denote
the
individual
consciousness
in
its
integrity
and
continuity
and
that
this
soul
undergoes
change
that
in
like
manner
as
it
is
integrated
so
it
is
disintegrated
is
a
thing
very
evident
for
aristotle
it
was
the
substantial
form
of
the
body
the
entelechy
but
not
a
substance
and
more
than
one
modern
has
called
it
an
epiphenomenon
an
absurd
term
the
appellation

suffices
rationalism
and
by
rationalism
i
mean
the
doctrine
that
abides
solely
by
reason
by
objective
truth
is
necessarily
materialist
and
let
not
idealists
be
scandalized
thereby
the
truth
is
it
is
necessary
to
be
perfectly
explicit
in
this
matter
that
what
we
call
materialism
means
for
us
nothing
else
but
the
doctrine
which
denies
the
immortality
of
the
individual
soul
the
persistence
of
personal
consciousness
after
death
in
another
sense
it
may
be
said
that
as
we
know
what
matter
is
no
more
than
we
know
what
spirit
is
and
as
matter
is
for
us
merely
an
idea
materialism
is
idealism
in
fact
and
as
regards
our
problem
the
most
vital
the
only
really
vital
problem
it
is
all
the
same
to
say
that
everything
is
matter
as
to
say
that
everything
is
idea
or
that
everything
is
energy
or
whatever
you
please
every
monist
system
will
always
seem
to
us
materialist
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
saved
only
by
the
dualist
systems
those
which
teach
that
human
consciousness
is
something
substantially
distinct
and
different
from
the
other
manifestations
of
phenomena
and
reason
is
naturally
monist
for
it
is
the
function
of
reason
to
understand
and
explain
the
universe
and
in
order
to
understand
and
explain
it
it
is
in
no
way
necessary
for
the
soul
to
be
an
imperishable
substance
for
the
purpose
of
explaining
and
understanding
our
psychic
life
for
psychology
the
hypothesis
of
the
soul
is
unnecessary
what
was
formerly
called
rational
psychology
in
opposition
to
empirical
psychology
is
not
psychology
but
metaphysics
and
very
muddy
metaphysics
neither
is
it
rational
but
profoundly
irrational
or
rather
the
pretended
rational
doctrine
of
the
substantiality
and
spirituality
of
the
soul
with
all
the
apparatus
that
accompanies
it
is
born
simply
of
the
necessity
which
men
feel
of
grounding
upon
reason
their
inexpugnable
longing
for
immortality
and
the
subsequent
belief
in
it
all
the
sophistries
which
aim
at
proving
that
the
soul
is
substance
simple
and
incorruptible
proceed
from
this
source
and
further
the
very
concept
of
substance
as
it
was
fixed
and
defined
by
scholasticism
a
concept
which
does
not
bear
criticism
is
a
theological
concept
designed
expressly
to
sustain
faith
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
william
james
in
the
third
of
the
lectures
which
he
devoted
to
pragmatism
in
the
lowell
institute
in
boston
in
december
and
january
the
weakest
thing
in
all
the
work
of
the
famous
american
thinker
an
extremely
weak
thing
indeed
speaks
as
follows
scholasticism
has
taken
the
notion
of
substance
from
common
sense
and
made
it
very
technical
and
articulate
few
things
would
seem
to
have
fewer
pragmatic
consequences
for
us
than
substances
cut
off
as
we
are
from
every
contact
with
them
yet
in
one
case
scholasticism
has
proved
the
importance
of
the
by
treating
it
pragmatically
i
refer
to
certain
disputes
about
the
mystery
of
the
eucharist
substance
here
would
appear
to
have
momentous
pragmatic
value
since
the
accidents
of
the
wafer
do
not
change
in
the
lord
supper
and
yet
it
has
become
the
very
body
of
christ
it
must
be
that
the
change
is
in
the
substance
solely
the
must
have
been
withdrawn
and
the
divine
substance
substituted
miraculously
without
altering
the
immediate
sensible
properties
but
though
these
do
not
alter
a
tremendous
difference
has
been
made
no
less
a
one
than
this
that
we
who
take
the
sacrament
now
feed
upon
the
very
substance
of
divinity
the
breaks
into
life
with
tremendous
effect
if
once
you
allow
that
substances
can
separate
from
their
accidents
and
exchange
these
latter
this
is
the
only
pragmatic
application
of
the
with
which
i
am
acquainted
and
it
is
obvious
that
it
will
only
be
treated
seriously
by
those
who
already
believe
in
the
presence
on
independent
grounds
now
leaving
on
one
side
the
question
as
to
whether
it
is
good
theology
and
i
do
not
say
good
reasoning
because
all
this
lies
outside
the
sphere
of
reason
to
confound
the
substance
of
the
body
the
body
not
the
soul
of
christ
with
the
very
substance
of
divinity
that
is
to
say
with
god
himself
it
would
appear
impossible
that
one
so
ardently
desirous
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
as
william
james
a
man
whose
whole
philosophy
aims
simply
at
establishing
this
belief
on
rational
grounds
should
not
have
perceived
that
the
pragmatic
application
of
the
concept
of
substance
to
the
doctrine
of
the
eucharistic
transubstantiation
is
merely
a
consequence
of
its
anterior
application
to
the
doctrine
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
as
i
explained
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
sacrament
of
the
eucharist
is
simply
the
reflection
of
the
belief
in
immortality
it
is
for
the
believer
the
proof
by
a
mystical
experience
that
the
soul
is
immortal
and
will
enjoy
god
eternally
and
the
concept
of
substance
was
born
above
all
and
before
all
of
the
concept
of
the
substantiality
of
the
soul
and
the
latter
was
affirmed
in
order
to
confirm
faith
in
the
persistence
of
the
soul
after
its
separation
from
the
body
such
was
at
the
same
time
its
first
pragmatic
application
and
its
origin
and
subsequently
we
have
transferred
this
concept
to
external
things
it
is
because
i
feel
myself
to
be
substance
that
is
to
say
permanent
in
the
midst
of
my
changes
that
i
attribute
substantiality
to
those
agents
exterior
to
me
which
are
also
permanent
in
the
midst
of
their
changes
just
as
the
concept
of
force
is
born
of
my
sensation
of
personal
effort
in
putting
a
thing
in
motion
read
carefully
in
the
first
part
of
the
of
thomas
aquinas
the
first
six
articles
of
question
which
discuss
whether
the
human
soul
is
body
whether
it
is
something
whether
such
also
is
the
soul
of
the
lower
animals
whether
the
soul
is
the
man
whether
the
soul
is
composed
of
matter
and
form
and
whether
it
is
incorruptible
and
then
say
if
all
this
is
not
subtly
intended
to
support
the
belief
that
this
incorruptible
substantiality
of
the
soul
renders
it
capable
of
receiving
from
god
immortality
for
it
is
clear
that
as
he
created
it
when
he
implanted
it
in
the
body
as
thomas
says
so
at
its
separation
from
the
body
he
could
annihilate
it
and
as
the
criticism
of
these
proofs
has
been
undertaken
a
hundred
times
it
is
unnecessary
to
repeat
it
here
is
it
possible
for
the
unforewarned
reason
to
conclude
that
our
soul
is
a
substance
from
the
fact
that
our
consciousness
of
our
identity
and
this
within
very
narrow
and
variable
limits
persists
through
all
the
changes
of
our
body
we
might
as
well
say
of
a
ship
that
put
out
to
sea
and
lost
first
one
piece
of
timber
which
was
replaced
by
another
of
the
same
shape
and
dimensions
then
lost
another
and
so
on
with
all
her
timbers
and
finally
returned
to
port
the
same
ship
with
the
same
build
the
same
qualities
recognizable
by
everybody
as
the
same
we
might
as
well
say
of
such
a
ship
that
it
had
a
substantial
soul
is
it
possible
for
the
unforewarned
reason
to
infer
the
simplicity
of
the
soul
from
the
fact
that
we
have
to
judge
and
unify
our
thoughts
thought
is
not
one
but
complex
and
for
the
reason
the
soul
is
nothing
but
the
succession
of
states
of
consciousness
in
books
of
psychology
written
from
the
spiritualist
point
of
view
it
is
customary
to
begin
the
discussion
of
the
existence
of
the
soul
as
a
simple
substance
separable
from
the
body
after
this
style
there
is
in
me
a
principle
which
thinks
wills
and
feels
now
this
implies
a
begging
of
the
question
for
it
is
far
from
being
an
immediate
truth
that
there
is
in
me
such
a
principle
the
immediate
truth
is
that
i
think
will
and
feel
and
i
the
i
that
thinks
wills
and
feels
am
immediately
my
living
body
with
the
states
of
consciousness
which
it
sustains
it
is
my
living
body
that
thinks
wills
and
feels
how
how
you
please
and
they
proceed
to
seek
to
establish
the
substantiality
of
the
soul
hypostatizing
the
states
of
consciousness
and
they
begin
by
saying
that
this
substance
must
be
simple
that
is
by
opposing
thought
to
extension
after
the
manner
of
the
cartesian
dualism
and
as
balmes
was
one
of
the
spiritualist
writers
who
have
given
the
clearest
and
most
concise
form
to
the
argument
i
will
present
it
as
he
expounds
it
in
the
second
chapter
of
his
de
filosofia
the
human
soul
is
simple
he
says
and
adds
simplicity
consists
in
the
absence
of
parts
and
the
soul
has
none
let
us
suppose
that
it
has
three
parts
a
b
i
ask
where
then
does
thought
reside
if
in
a
only
then
b
and
c
are
superfluous
and
consequently
the
simple
subject
a
will
be
the
soul
if
thought
resides
in
a
b
and
c
it
follows
that
thought
is
divided
into
parts
which
is
absurd
what
sort
of
a
thing
is
a
perception
a
comparison
a
judgement
a
ratiocination
distributed
among
three
subjects
a
more
obvious
begging
of
the
question
can
not
be
conceived
balmes
begins
by
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
whole
as
a
whole
is
incapable
of
making
a
judgement
he
continues
the
unity
of
consciousness
is
opposed
to
the
division
of
the
soul
when
we
think
there
is
a
subject
which
knows
everything
that
it
thinks
and
this
is
impossible
if
parts
be
attributed
to
it
of
the
thought
that
is
in
a
b
and
c
will
know
nothing
and
so
in
the
other
cases
respectively
there
will
not
therefore
be
consciousness
of
the
whole
thought
each
part
will
have
its
special
consciousness
and
there
will
be
within
us
as
many
thinking
beings
as
there
are
parts
the
begging
of
the
question
continues
it
is
assumed
without
any
proof
that
a
whole
as
a
whole
can
not
perceive
as
a
unit
balmes
then
proceeds
to
ask
if
these
parts
a
b
and
c
are
simple
or
compound
and
repeats
his
argument
until
he
arrives
at
the
conclusion
that
the
thinking
subject
must
be
a
part
which
is
not
a
whole
that
is
simple
the
argument
is
based
as
will
be
seen
upon
the
unity
of
apperception
and
of
judgement
subsequently
he
endeavours
to
refute
the
hypothesis
of
a
communication
of
the
parts
among
themselves
balmes
and
with
him
the
spiritualists
who
seek
to
rationalize
faith
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
ignore
the
only
rational
explanation
which
is
that
apperception
and
judgement
are
a
resultant
that
perceptions
or
ideas
themselves
are
components
which
agree
they
begin
by
supposing
something
external
to
and
distinct
from
the
states
of
consciousness
something
that
is
not
the
living
body
which
supports
these
states
something
that
is
not
i
but
is
within
me
the
soul
is
simple
others
say
because
it
reflects
upon
itself
as
a
complete
whole
no
the
state
of
consciousness
a
in
which
i
think
of
my
previous
state
of
consciousness
b
is
not
the
same
as
its
predecessor
or
if
i
think
of
my
soul
i
think
of
an
idea
distinct
from
the
act
by
which
i
think
of
it
to
think
that
one
thinks
and
nothing
more
is
not
to
think
the
soul
is
the
principle
of
life
it
is
said
yes
and
similarly
the
category
of
force
or
energy
has
been
conceived
as
the
principle
of
movement
but
these
are
concepts
not
phenomena
not
external
realities
does
the
principle
of
movement
move
and
only
that
which
moves
has
external
reality
does
the
principle
of
life
live
hume
was
right
when
he
said
that
he
never
encountered
this
idea
of
himself
that
he
only
observed
himself
desiring
or
performing
or
feeling
something
the
idea
of
some
individual
thing
of
this
inkstand
in
front
of
me
of
that
horse
standing
at
my
gate
of
these
two
and
not
of
any
other
individuals
of
the
same
class
is
the
fact
the
phenomenon
itself
the
idea
of
myself
is
myself
all
the
efforts
to
substantiate
consciousness
making
it
independent
of
extension
remember
that
descartes
opposed
thought
to
extension
are
but
sophistical
subtilties
intended
to
establish
the
rationality
of
faith
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
it
is
sought
to
give
the
value
of
objective
reality
to
that
which
does
not
possess
it
to
that
whose
reality
exists
only
in
thought
and
the
immortality
that
we
crave
is
a
phenomenal
immortality
it
is
the
continuation
of
this
present
life
the
unity
of
consciousness
is
for
scientific
psychology
the
only
rational
psychology
simply
a
phenomenal
unity
no
one
can
say
what
a
substantial
unity
is
and
what
is
more
no
one
can
say
what
a
substance
is
for
the
notion
of
substance
is
a
category
it
is
a
noumenon
and
belongs
properly
to
the
unknowable
that
is
to
say
according
to
the
sense
in
which
it
is
understood
but
in
its
transcendental
sense
it
is
something
really
unknowable
and
strictly
irrational
it
is
precisely
this
concept
of
substance
that
an
unforewarned
mind
reduces
to
a
use
that
is
very
far
from
that
pragmatic
application
to
which
william
james
referred
and
this
application
is
not
saved
by
understanding
it
in
an
idealistic
sense
according
to
the
berkeleyan
principle
that
to
be
is
to
be
perceived
est
to
say
that
everything
is
idea
or
that
everything
is
spirit
is
the
same
as
saying
that
everything
is
matter
or
that
everything
is
energy
for
if
everything
is
idea
or
everything
spirit
and
if
therefore
this
diamond
is
idea
or
spirit
just
as
my
consciousness
is
it
is
not
plain
why
the
diamond
should
not
endure
for
ever
if
my
consciousness
because
it
is
idea
or
spirit
endures
for
ever
george
berkeley
anglican
bishop
of
cloyne
and
brother
in
spirit
to
the
anglican
bishop
joseph
butler
was
equally
as
anxious
to
save
the
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
in
the
first
words
of
the
preface
to
his
concerning
the
principles
of
human
he
tells
us
that
he
considers
that
this
treatise
will
be
useful
particularly
to
those
who
are
tainted
with
scepticism
or
want
a
demonstration
of
the
existence
and
immateriality
of
god
or
the
natural
immortality
of
the
soul
in
paragraph
cxl
he
lays
it
down
that
we
have
an
idea
or
rather
a
notion
of
spirit
and
that
we
know
other
spirits
by
means
of
our
own
from
which
follows
so
in
the
next
paragraph
he
roundly
affirms
the
natural
immortality
of
the
soul
and
here
he
enters
upon
a
series
of
confusions
arising
from
the
ambiguity
with
which
he
invests
the
term
notion
and
after
having
established
the
immortality
of
the
soul
almost
as
it
were
on
the
ground
that
the
soul
is
not
passive
like
the
body
he
proceeds
to
tell
us
in
paragraph
cxlvii
that
the
existence
of
god
is
more
evident
than
that
of
man
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
there
are
still
some
who
are
doubtful
the
question
was
complicated
by
making
consciousness
a
property
of
the
soul
consciousness
being
something
more
than
soul
that
is
to
say
a
substantial
form
of
the
body
the
originator
of
all
the
organic
functions
of
the
body
the
soul
not
only
thinks
feels
and
wills
but
moves
the
body
and
prompts
its
vital
functions
in
the
human
soul
are
united
the
vegetative
animal
and
rational
functions
such
is
the
theory
but
the
soul
separated
from
the
body
can
have
neither
vegetative
nor
animal
functions
a
theory
in
short
which
for
the
reason
is
a
veritable
contexture
of
confusions
after
the
renaissance
and
the
restoration
of
purely
rational
thought
emancipated
from
all
theology
the
doctrine
of
the
mortality
of
the
soul
was
by
the
newly
published
writings
of
the
philosopher
alexander
of
aphrodisias
and
by
pietro
pomponazzi
and
others
and
in
point
of
fact
little
or
nothing
can
be
added
to
what
pomponazzi
has
written
in
his
de
immortalitate
it
is
reason
itself
and
it
serves
nothing
to
reiterate
his
arguments
attempts
have
not
been
wanting
however
to
find
an
empirical
support
for
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
among
these
may
be
counted
the
work
of
frederic
myers
on
personality
and
its
survival
of
bodily
no
one
ever
approached
more
eagerly
than
myself
the
two
thick
volumes
of
this
work
in
which
the
leading
spirit
of
the
society
for
psychical
research
resumed
that
formidable
mass
of
data
relating
to
presentiments
apparitions
of
the
dead
the
phenomena
of
dreams
telepathy
hypnotism
sensorial
automatism
ecstasy
and
all
the
rest
that
goes
to
furnish
the
spiritualist
arsenal
i
entered
upon
the
reading
of
it
not
only
without
that
temper
of
cautious
suspicion
which
men
of
science
maintain
in
investigations
of
this
character
but
even
with
a
predisposition
in
its
favour
as
one
who
comes
to
seek
the
confirmation
of
his
innermost
longings
but
for
this
reason
was
my
disillusion
all
the
greater
in
spite
of
its
critical
apparatus
it
does
not
differ
in
any
respect
from
medieval
there
is
a
fundamental
defect
of
method
of
logic
and
if
the
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
has
been
unable
to
find
vindication
in
rational
empiricism
neither
is
it
satisfied
with
pantheism
to
say
that
everything
is
god
and
that
when
we
die
we
return
to
god
or
more
accurately
continue
in
him
avails
our
longing
nothing
for
if
this
indeed
be
so
then
we
were
in
god
before
we
were
born
and
if
when
we
die
we
return
to
where
we
were
before
being
born
then
the
human
soul
the
individual
consciousness
is
perishable
and
since
we
know
very
well
that
god
the
personal
and
conscious
god
of
christian
monotheism
is
simply
the
provider
and
above
all
the
guarantor
of
our
immortality
pantheism
is
said
and
rightly
said
to
be
merely
atheism
disguised
and
in
my
opinion
undisguised
and
they
were
right
in
calling
spinoza
an
atheist
for
his
is
the
most
logical
the
most
rational
system
of
pantheism
neither
is
the
longing
for
immortality
saved
but
rather
dissolved
and
submerged
by
agnosticism
or
the
doctrine
of
the
unknowable
which
when
it
has
professed
to
wish
to
leave
religious
feelings
scathless
has
always
been
inspired
by
the
most
refined
hypocrisy
the
whole
of
the
first
part
of
spencer
and
especially
the
fifth
chapter
entitled
reconciliation
that
between
reason
and
faith
or
science
and
religion
being
understood
is
a
model
at
the
same
time
of
philosophical
superficiality
and
religious
insincerity
of
the
most
refined
british
cant
the
unknowable
if
it
is
something
more
than
the
merely
hitherto
unknown
is
but
a
purely
negative
concept
a
concept
of
limitation
and
upon
this
foundation
no
human
feeling
can
be
built
up
the
science
of
religion
on
the
other
hand
of
religion
considered
as
an
individual
and
social
psychic
phenomenon
irrespective
of
the
transcendental
objective
validity
of
religious
affirmations
is
a
science
which
in
explaining
the
origin
of
the
belief
that
the
soul
is
something
that
can
live
disjoined
from
the
body
has
destroyed
the
rationality
of
this
belief
however
much
the
religious
man
may
repeat
with
schleiermacher
science
can
teach
thee
nothing
it
is
for
science
to
learn
from
thee
inwardly
he
thinks
otherwise
from
whatever
side
the
matter
is
regarded
it
is
always
found
that
reason
confronts
our
longing
for
personal
immortality
and
contradicts
it
and
the
truth
is
in
all
strictness
that
reason
is
the
enemy
of
life
a
terrible
thing
is
intelligence
it
tends
to
death
as
memory
tends
to
stability
the
living
the
absolutely
unstable
the
absolutely
individual
is
strictly
unintelligible
logic
tends
to
reduce
everything
to
identities
and
genera
to
each
representation
having
no
more
than
one
single
and
content
in
whatever
place
time
or
relation
it
may
occur
to
us
and
there
is
nothing
that
remains
the
same
for
two
successive
moments
of
its
existence
my
idea
of
god
is
different
each
time
that
i
conceive
it
identity
which
is
death
is
the
goal
of
the
intellect
the
mind
seeks
what
is
dead
for
what
is
living
escapes
it
it
seeks
to
congeal
the
flowing
stream
in
blocks
of
ice
it
seeks
to
arrest
it
in
order
to
analyze
a
body
it
is
necessary
to
extenuate
or
destroy
it
in
order
to
understand
anything
it
is
necessary
to
kill
it
to
lay
it
out
rigid
in
the
mind
science
is
a
cemetery
of
dead
ideas
even
though
life
may
issue
from
them
worms
also
feed
upon
corpses
my
own
thoughts
tumultuous
and
agitated
in
the
innermost
recesses
of
my
soul
once
they
are
torn
from
their
roots
in
the
heart
poured
out
on
to
this
paper
and
there
fixed
in
unalterable
shape
are
already
only
the
corpses
of
thoughts
how
then
shall
reason
open
its
portals
to
the
revelation
of
life
it
is
a
tragic
combat
it
is
the
very
essence
of
tragedy
this
combat
of
life
with
reason
and
truth
is
truth
something
that
is
lived
or
that
is
comprehended
it
is
only
necessary
to
read
the
terrible
of
plato
to
arrive
at
his
tragic
conclusion
that
the
one
is
and
is
not
and
both
itself
and
others
in
relation
to
themselves
and
one
another
are
and
are
not
and
appear
to
be
and
appear
not
to
be
all
that
is
vital
is
irrational
and
all
that
is
rational
is
for
reason
is
essentially
sceptical
the
rational
in
effect
is
simply
the
relational
reason
is
limited
to
relating
irrational
elements
mathematics
is
the
only
perfect
science
inasmuch
as
it
adds
subtracts
multiplies
and
divides
numbers
but
not
real
and
substantial
things
inasmuch
as
it
is
the
most
formal
of
the
sciences
who
can
extract
the
cube
root
of
an
nevertheless
we
need
logic
this
terrible
power
in
order
to
communicate
thoughts
and
perceptions
and
even
in
order
to
think
and
perceive
for
we
think
with
words
we
perceive
with
forms
to
think
is
to
converse
with
oneself
and
speech
is
social
and
social
are
thought
and
logic
but
may
they
not
perhaps
possess
a
content
an
individual
matter
incommunicable
and
untranslatable
and
may
not
this
be
the
source
of
their
power
the
truth
is
that
man
the
prisoner
of
logic
without
which
he
can
not
think
has
always
sought
to
make
logic
subservient
to
his
desires
and
principally
to
his
fundamental
desire
he
has
always
sought
to
hold
fast
to
logic
and
especially
in
the
middle
ages
in
the
interests
of
theology
and
jurisprudence
both
of
which
based
themselves
on
what
was
established
by
authority
it
was
not
until
very
much
later
that
logic
propounded
the
problem
of
knowledge
the
problem
of
its
own
validity
the
scrutiny
of
the
metalogical
foundations
the
western
theology
dean
stanley
wrote
is
essentially
logical
in
form
and
based
on
law
the
eastern
theology
is
rhetorical
in
form
and
based
on
philosophy
the
latin
divine
succeeded
to
the
roman
advocate
the
oriental
divine
succeeded
to
the
grecian
sophist
and
all
the
laboured
arguments
in
support
of
our
hunger
of
immortality
which
pretend
to
be
grounded
on
reason
or
logic
are
merely
advocacy
and
sophistry
the
property
and
characteristic
of
advocacy
is
in
effect
to
make
use
of
logic
in
the
interests
of
a
thesis
that
is
to
be
defended
while
on
the
other
hand
the
strictly
scientific
method
proceeds
from
the
facts
the
data
presented
to
us
by
reality
in
order
that
it
may
arrive
or
not
arrive
as
the
case
may
be
at
a
certain
conclusion
what
is
important
is
to
define
the
problem
clearly
whence
it
follows
that
progress
consists
not
seldom
in
undoing
what
has
been
done
advocacy
always
supposes
a
and
its
arguments
are
and
theology
that
pretends
to
be
rational
is
nothing
but
advocacy
theology
proceeds
from
dogma
and
dogma
in
its
primitive
and
most
direct
sense
signifies
a
decree
something
akin
to
the
latin
that
which
has
seemed
to
the
legislative
authority
fitting
to
be
law
this
juridical
concept
is
the
of
theology
for
the
theologian
as
for
the
advocate
dogma
law
is
something
given
a
which
admits
of
discussion
only
in
respect
of
its
application
and
its
most
exact
interpretation
hence
it
follows
that
the
theological
or
advocatory
spirit
is
in
its
principle
dogmatical
while
the
strictly
scientific
and
purely
rational
spirit
is
sceptical
that
is
investigative
it
is
so
at
least
in
its
principle
for
there
is
the
other
sense
of
the
term
scepticism
that
which
is
most
usual
that
of
a
system
of
doubt
suspicion
and
uncertainty
and
this
has
arisen
from
the
theological
or
advocatory
use
of
reason
from
the
abuse
of
dogmatism
the
endeavour
to
apply
the
law
of
authority
the
the
dogma
to
different
and
sometimes
contraposed
practical
necessities
is
what
has
engendered
the
scepticism
of
doubt
it
is
advocacy
or
what
amounts
to
the
same
thing
theology
that
teaches
the
distrust
of
reason
not
true
science
not
the
science
of
investigation
sceptical
in
the
primitive
and
direct
meaning
of
the
word
which
hastens
towards
no
predetermined
solution
nor
proceeds
save
by
the
testing
of
hypotheses
take
the
of
thomas
the
classical
monument
of
the
theology
that
is
of
the
advocacy
of
catholicism
and
open
it
where
you
please
first
comes
the
thesis
whether
such
a
thing
be
thus
or
otherwise
then
the
objections
primum
sic
next
the
answers
to
these
objections
contra
or
pure
advocacy
and
underlying
many
perhaps
most
of
its
arguments
you
will
find
a
logical
fallacy
which
may
be
expressed
by
this
syllogism
i
do
not
understand
this
fact
save
by
giving
it
this
explanation
it
is
thus
that
i
must
understand
it
therefore
this
must
be
its
explanation
the
alternative
being
that
i
am
left
without
any
understanding
of
it
at
all
true
science
teaches
above
all
to
doubt
and
to
be
ignorant
advocacy
neither
doubts
nor
believes
that
it
does
not
know
it
requires
a
solution
to
the
mentality
that
assumes
more
or
less
consciously
that
we
must
of
necessity
find
a
solution
to
every
problem
belongs
the
argument
based
on
the
disastrous
consequences
of
a
thing
take
any
book
of
apologetics
that
is
to
say
of
theological
advocacy
and
you
will
see
how
many
times
you
will
meet
with
this
phrase
the
disastrous
consequences
of
this
doctrine
now
the
disastrous
consequences
of
a
doctrine
prove
at
most
that
the
doctrine
is
disastrous
but
not
that
it
is
false
for
there
is
no
proof
that
the
true
is
necessarily
that
which
suits
us
best
the
identification
of
the
true
and
the
good
is
but
a
pious
wish
in
his
sur
blaise
vinet
says
of
the
two
needs
that
unceasingly
belabour
human
nature
that
of
happiness
is
not
only
the
more
universally
felt
and
the
more
constantly
experienced
but
it
is
also
the
more
imperious
and
this
need
is
not
only
of
the
senses
it
is
intellectual
it
is
not
only
for
the
it
is
for
the
that
happiness
is
a
necessity
happiness
forms
a
part
of
truth
this
last
proposition
bonheur
fait
partie
de
la
is
a
proposition
of
pure
advocacy
but
not
of
science
or
of
pure
reason
it
would
be
better
to
say
that
truth
forms
a
part
of
happiness
in
a
tertullianesque
sense
in
the
sense
of
quia
which
means
actually
quia
i
believe
because
it
is
a
thing
consoling
to
me
no
for
reason
truth
is
that
of
which
it
can
be
proved
that
it
is
that
it
exists
whether
it
console
us
or
not
and
reason
is
certainly
not
a
consoling
faculty
that
terrible
latin
poet
lucretius
whose
apparent
serenity
and
epicurean
conceal
so
much
despair
said
that
piety
consists
in
the
power
to
contemplate
all
things
with
a
serene
soul
posse
mente
omnia
and
it
was
the
same
lucretius
who
wrote
that
religion
can
persuade
us
into
so
great
evils
religio
potuit
suadere
and
it
is
true
that
religion
above
all
the
christian
religion
has
been
as
the
apostle
says
to
the
jews
a
and
to
the
intellectuals
foolishness
the
christian
religion
the
religion
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
was
called
by
tacitus
a
pernicious
superstition
and
he
asserted
that
it
involved
a
hatred
of
mankind
generis
speaking
of
the
age
in
which
these
men
lived
the
most
genuinely
rationalistic
age
in
the
world
history
flaubert
writing
to
madame
roger
des
genettes
uttered
these
pregnant
words
you
are
right
we
must
speak
with
respect
of
lucretius
i
see
no
one
who
can
compare
with
him
except
byron
and
byron
has
not
his
gravity
nor
the
sincerity
of
his
sadness
the
melancholy
of
the
ancients
seems
to
me
more
profound
than
that
of
the
moderns
who
all
more
or
less
presuppose
an
immortality
on
the
yonder
side
of
the
but
for
the
ancients
this
black
hole
was
the
infinite
itself
the
procession
of
their
dreams
is
imaged
against
a
background
of
immutable
ebony
the
gods
being
no
more
and
christ
being
not
yet
there
was
between
cicero
and
marcus
aurelius
a
unique
moment
in
which
man
stood
alone
nowhere
else
do
i
find
this
grandeur
but
what
renders
lucretius
intolerable
is
his
physics
which
he
gives
as
if
positive
if
he
is
weak
it
is
because
he
did
not
doubt
enough
he
wished
to
explain
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
yes
lucretius
wished
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
a
solution
and
what
is
worse
he
wished
to
find
consolation
in
reason
for
there
is
also
an
advocacy
and
an
many
very
many
men
of
science
the
majority
of
those
who
call
themselves
rationalists
are
afflicted
by
it
the
rationalist
acts
rationally
that
is
to
say
he
does
not
speak
out
of
his
part
so
long
as
he
confines
himself
to
denying
that
reason
satisfies
our
vital
hunger
for
immortality
but
furious
at
not
being
able
to
believe
he
soon
becomes
a
prey
to
the
vindictiveness
of
the
and
exclaims
with
the
pharisees
this
people
who
knoweth
not
the
law
are
cursed
there
is
much
truth
in
these
words
of
soloviev
i
have
a
foreboding
of
the
near
approach
of
a
time
when
christians
will
gather
together
again
in
the
catacombs
because
of
the
persecution
of
the
faith
a
persecution
less
brutal
perhaps
than
that
of
nero
day
but
not
less
refined
in
its
severity
consummated
by
mendacity
derision
and
all
the
hypocrisies
the
hate
the
scientificist
i
do
not
say
scientific
fury
is
manifest
consider
not
the
more
detached
scientific
investigators
those
who
know
how
to
doubt
but
the
fanatics
of
rationalism
and
observe
with
what
gross
brutality
they
speak
of
faith
vogt
considered
it
probable
that
the
cranial
structure
of
the
apostles
was
of
a
pronounced
simian
character
of
the
indecencies
of
haeckel
that
supreme
incomprehender
there
is
no
need
to
speak
nor
yet
of
those
of
büchner
even
virchow
is
not
free
from
them
and
others
work
with
more
subtilty
there
are
people
who
seem
not
to
be
content
with
not
believing
that
there
is
another
life
or
rather
with
believing
that
there
is
none
but
who
are
vexed
and
hurt
that
others
should
believe
in
it
or
even
should
wish
that
it
might
exist
and
this
attitude
is
as
contemptible
as
that
is
worthy
of
respect
which
characterizes
those
who
though
urged
by
the
need
they
have
of
it
to
believe
in
another
life
are
unable
to
believe
but
of
this
most
noble
attitude
of
the
spirit
the
most
profound
the
most
human
and
the
most
fruitful
the
attitude
of
despair
we
will
speak
later
on
and
the
rationalists
who
do
not
succumb
to
the
fury
are
bent
on
convincing
men
that
there
are
motives
for
living
and
consolations
for
having
been
born
even
though
there
shall
come
a
time
at
the
end
of
some
tens
or
hundreds
or
millions
of
centuries
when
all
human
consciousness
shall
have
ceased
to
exist
and
these
motives
for
living
and
working
this
thing
which
some
call
humanism
are
the
amazing
products
of
the
affective
and
emotional
hollowness
of
rationalism
and
of
its
stupendous
hypocrisy
a
hypocrisy
bent
on
sacrificing
sincerity
to
veracity
and
sworn
not
to
confess
that
reason
is
a
dissolvent
and
disconsolatory
power
must
i
repeat
again
what
i
have
already
said
about
all
this
business
of
manufacturing
culture
of
progressing
of
realizing
good
truth
and
beauty
of
establishing
justice
on
earth
of
ameliorating
life
for
those
who
shall
come
after
us
of
subserving
i
know
not
what
destiny
and
all
this
without
our
taking
thought
for
the
ultimate
end
of
each
one
of
us
must
i
again
declare
to
you
the
supreme
vacuity
of
culture
of
science
of
art
of
good
of
truth
of
beauty
of
justice
of
all
these
beautiful
conceptions
if
at
the
last
in
four
days
or
in
four
millions
of
centuries
it
matters
not
which
no
human
consciousness
shall
exist
to
appropriate
this
civilization
this
science
art
good
truth
beauty
justice
and
all
the
rest
many
and
very
various
have
been
the
rationalist
devices
more
or
less
rational
by
means
of
which
from
the
days
of
the
epicureans
and
the
stoics
it
has
been
sought
to
discover
rational
consolation
in
truth
and
to
convince
men
although
those
who
sought
so
to
do
remained
themselves
unconvinced
that
there
are
motives
for
working
and
lures
for
living
even
though
the
human
consciousness
be
destined
some
day
to
disappear
the
epicurean
attitude
the
extreme
and
grossest
expression
of
which

spinoza
the
most
logical
and
consistent
of
atheists
i
mean
of
those
who
deny
the
persistence
of
individual
consciousness
through
indefinite
future
time
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
pious
spinoza
devoted
the
fifth
and
last
part
of
his
to
elucidating
the
path
that
leads
to
liberty
and
to
determining
the
concept
of
happiness
the
concept
concept
not
feeling
for
spinoza
who
was
a
terrible
intellectualist
happiness
is
a
concept
and
the
love
of
god
an
intellectual
love
after
establishing
in
proposition
xxi
of
the
fifth
part
that
the
mind
can
imagine
nothing
neither
can
it
remember
anything
that
is
past
save
during
the
continuance
of
the
body
which
is
equivalent
to
denying
the
immortality
of
the
soul
since
a
soul
which
disjoined
from
the
body
in
which
it
lived
does
not
remember
its
past
is
neither
immortal
nor
is
it
a
soul
he
goes
on
to
affirm
in
proposition
xxiii
that
the
human
mind
can
not
be
absolutely
destroyed
with
the
body
but
there
remains
of
it
something
which
is
and
this
eternity
of
the
mind
is
a
certain
mode
of
thinking
but
do
not
let
yourselves
be
deceived
there
is
no
such
eternity
of
the
individual
mind
everything
is
æternitatis
that
is
to
say
pure
illusion
nothing
could
be
more
dreary
nothing
more
desolating
nothing
more
than
this
happiness
this
of
spinoza
that
consists
in
the
intellectual
love
of
the
mind
towards
god
which
is
nothing
else
but
the
very
love
with
which
god
loves
himself
prop
our
happiness
that
is
to
say
our
liberty
consists
in
the
constant
and
eternal
love
of
god
towards
men
so
affirms
the
corollary
to
this
proposition
and
all
this
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
which
is
the
final
and
crowning
proposition
of
the
whole
that
happiness
is
not
the
reward
of
virtue
but
virtue
itself
the
everlasting
refrain
or
to
put
it
plainly
we
proceed
from
god
and
to
god
we
return
which
translated
into
concrete
language
the
language
of
life
and
feeling
means
that
my
personal
consciousness
sprang
from
nothingness
from
my
unconsciousness
and
to
nothingness
it
will
return
and
this
most
dreary
and
desolating
voice
of
spinoza
is
the
very
voice
of
reason
and
the
liberty
of
which
he
tells
us
is
a
terrible
liberty
and
against
spinoza
and
his
doctrine
of
happiness
there
is
only
one
irresistible
argument
the
argument
was
he
happy
benedict
spinoza
while
to
allay
his
inner
unhappiness
he
was
discoursing
of
happiness
was
he
free
in
the
corollary
to
proposition
xli
of
this
same
final
and
most
tragic
part
of
that
tremendous
tragedy
of
his
the
poor
desperate
jew
of
amsterdam
discourses
of
the
common
persuasion
of
the
vulgar
of
the
truth
of
eternal
life
let
us
hear
what
he
says
it
would
appear
that
they
esteem
piety
and
religion
and
indeed
all
that
is
referred
to
fortitude
or
strength
of
mind
as
burdens
which
they
expect
to
lay
down
after
death
when
they
hope
to
receive
a
reward
for
their
servitude
not
for
their
piety
and
religion
in
this
life
nor
is
it
even
this
hope
alone
that
leads
them
the
fear
of
frightful
punishments
with
which
they
are
menaced
after
death
also
influences
them
to
live
in
so
far
as
their
impotence
and
poverty
of
spirit
permits
in
conformity
with
the
prescription
of
the
divine
law
and
were
not
this
hope
and
this
fear
infused
into
the
minds
of
men
but
on
the
contrary
did
they
believe
that
the
soul
perished
with
the
body
and
that
beyond
the
grave
there
was
no
other
life
prepared
for
the
wretched
who
had
borne
the
burden
in
this
they
would
return
to
their
natural
inclinations
preferring
to
accommodate
everything
to
their
own
liking
and
would
follow
fortune
rather
than
reason
but
all
this
appears
no
less
absurd
than
it
would
be
to
suppose
that
a
man
because
he
did
not
believe
that
he
could
nourish
his
body
eternally
with
wholesome
food
would
saturate
himself
with
deadly
poisons
or
than
if
because
believing
that
his
soul
was
not
eternal
and
immortal
he
should
therefore
prefer
to
be
without
a
soul
and
to
live
without
reason
all
of
which
is
so
absurd
as
to
be
scarcely
worth
refuting
adeo
absurda
sunt
ut
vix
recenseri
when
a
thing
is
said
to
be
not
worth
refuting
you
may
be
sure
that
either
it
is
flagrantly
stupid
in
which
case
all
comment
is
superfluous
or
it
is
something
formidable
the
very
crux
of
the
problem
and
this
it
is
in
this
case
yes
poor
portuguese
jew
exiled
in
holland
yes
that
he
who
is
convinced
without
a
vestige
of
doubt
without
the
faintest
hope
of
any
saving
uncertainty
that
his
soul
is
not
immortal
should
prefer
to
be
without
a
soul
or
irrational
or
idiot
that
he
should
prefer
not
to
have
been
born
is
a
supposition
that
has
nothing
absolutely
nothing
absurd
in
it
was
he
happy
the
poor
jewish
intellectualist
definer
of
intellectual
love
and
of
happiness
for
that
and
no
other
is
the
problem
what
does
it
profit
thee
to
know
the
definition
of
compunction
if
thou
dost
not
feel
it
says
à
kempis
and
what
profits
it
to
discuss
or
to
define
happiness
if
you
can
not
thereby
achieve
happiness
not
inapposite
in
this
connection
is
that
terrible
story
that
diderot
tells
of
a
eunuch
who
desired
to
take
lessons
in
esthetics
from
a
native
of
marseilles
in
order
that
he
might
be
better
qualified
to
select
the
slaves
destined
for
the
harem
of
the
sultan
his
master
at
the
end
of
the
first
lesson
a
physiological
lesson
brutally
and
carnally
physiological
the
eunuch
exclaimed
bitterly
it
is
evident
that
i
shall
never
know
esthetics
even
so
and
just
as
eunuchs
will
never
know
esthetics
as
applied
to
the
selection
of
beautiful
women
so
neither
will
pure
rationalists
ever
know
ethics
nor
will
they
ever
succeed
in
defining
happiness
for
happiness
is
a
thing
that
is
lived
and
felt
not
a
thing
that
is
reasoned
about
or
defined
and
you
have
another
rationalist
one
not
sad
or
submissive
like
spinoza
but
rebellious
and
though
concealing
a
despair
not
less
bitter
making
a
hypocritical
pretence
of
you
have
nietzsche
who
discovered
that
counterfeit
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
which
is
called
eternal
recurrence
and
which
is
in
fact
the
most
stupendous
or
the
number
of
atoms
or
irreducible
primary
elements
being
finite
and
the
universe
eternal
a
combination
identical
with
that
which
at
present
exists
must
at
some
future
time
be
reproduced
and
therefore
that
which
now
is
must
be
repeated
an
infinite
number
of
times
this
is
evident
and
just
as
i
shall
live
again
the
life
that
i
am
now
living
so
i
have
already
lived
it
before
an
infinite
number
of
times
for
there
is
an
eternity
that
stretches
into
the
past
parte
just
as
there
will
be
one
stretching
into
the
future
parte
but
unfortunately
it
happens
that
i
remember
none
of
my
previous
existences
and
perhaps
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
remember
them
for
two
things
absolutely
and
completely
identical
are
but
one
instead
of
supposing
that
we
live
in
a
finite
universe
composed
of
a
finite
number
of
irreducible
primary
elements
suppose
that
we
live
in
an
infinite
universe
without
limits
in
space
which
concrete
infinity
is
not
less
inconceivable
than
the
concrete
eternity
in
time
then
it
will
follow
that
this
system
of
ours
that
of
the
milky
way
is
repeated
an
infinite
number
of
times
in
the
infinite
of
space
and
that
therefore
i
am
now
living
an
infinite
number
of
lives
all
exactly
identical
a
jest
as
you
see
but
one
not
less
comic
that
is
to
say
not
less
tragic
than
that
of
nietzsche
that
of
the
laughing
lion
and
why
does
the
lion
laugh
i
think
he
laughs
with
rage
because
he
can
never
succeed
in
finding
consolation
in
the
thought
that
he
has
been
the
same
lion
before
and
is
destined
to
be
the
same
lion
again
but
if
spinoza
and
nietzsche
were
indeed
both
rationalists
each
after
his
own
manner
they
were
not
spiritual
eunuchs
they
had
heart
feeling
and
above
all
hunger
a
mad
hunger
for
eternity
for
immortality
the
physical
eunuch
does
not
feel
the
need
of
reproducing
himself
carnally
in
the
body
and
neither
does
the
spiritual
eunuch
feel
the
hunger
for
certain
it
is
that
there
are
some
who
assert
that
reason
suffices
them
and
they
counsel
us
to
desist
from
seeking
to
penetrate
into
the
impenetrable
but
of
those
who
say
that
they
have
no
need
of
any
faith
in
an
eternal
personal
life
to
furnish
them
with
incentives
to
living
and
motives
for
action
i
know
not
well
how
to
think
a
man
blind
from
birth
may
also
assure
us
that
he
feels
no
great
longing
to
enjoy
the
world
of
sight
nor
suffers
any
great
anguish
from
not
having
enjoyed
it
and
we
must
needs
believe
him
for
what
is
wholly
unknown
can
not
be
the
object
of
desire
volitum
quin
there
can
be
no
volition
save
of
things
already
known
but
i
can
not
be
persuaded
that
he
who
has
once
in
his
life
either
in
his
youth
or
for
some
other
brief
space
of
time
cherished
the
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
will
ever
find
peace
without
it
and
of
this
sort
of
blindness
from
birth
there
are
but
few
instances
among
us
and
then
only
by
a
kind
of
strange
aberration
for
the
merely
and
exclusively
rational
man
is
an
aberration
and
nothing
but
an
aberration
more
sincere
much
more
sincere
are
those
who
say
we
must
not
talk
about
it
for
in
talking
about
it
we
only
waste
our
time
and
weaken
our
will
let
us
do
our
duty
here
and
hereafter
let
come
what
may
but
this
sincerity
hides
a
yet
deeper
insincerity
may
it
perhaps
be
that
by
saying
we
must
not
talk
about
it
they
succeed
in
not
thinking
about
it
our
will
is
weakened
and
what
then
we
lose
the
capacity
for
human
action
and
what
then
it
is
very
convenient
to
tell
a
man
whom
a
fatal
disease
condemns
to
an
early
death
and
who
knows
it
not
to
think
about
it

better
to
work
and
to
forget
and
not
to
probe
into
this
vast
mystery
of
the
universe
carducci
wrote
in
his
the
same
carducci
who
at
the
close
of
his
ode
monte
tells
us
how
the
earth
the
mother
of
the
fugitive
soul
must
roll
its
burden
of
glory
and
sorrow
round
the
sun
until
worn
out
beneath
the
equator
mocked
by
the
last
flames
of
dying
heat
the
exhausted
human
race
is
reduced
to
a
single
man
and
woman
who
standing
in
the
midst
of
dead
woods
surrounded
by
sheer
mountains
livid
with
glassy
eyes
watch
thee
o
sun
set
across
the
immense
frozen
waste
but
is
it
possible
for
us
to
give
ourselves
to
any
serious
and
lasting
work
forgetting
the
vast
mystery
of
the
universe
and
abandoning
all
attempt
to
understand
it
is
it
possible
to
contemplate
the
vast
all
with
a
serene
soul
in
the
spirit
of
the
lucretian
piety
if
we
are
conscious
of
the
thought
that
a
time
must
come
when
this
all
will
no
longer
be
reflected
in
any
human
consciousness
cain
in
byron
poem
asks
of
lucifer
the
prince
of
the
intellectuals
are
ye
happy
and
lucifer
replies
we
are
mighty
cain
questions
again
are
ye
happy
and
then
the
great
intellectual
says
to
him
no
art
thou
and
further
on
this
same
lucifer
says
to
adah
the
sister
and
wife
of
cain
choose
betwixt
love
and
knowledge
since
there
is
no
other
choice
and
in
the
same
stupendous
poem
when
cain
says
that
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
was
a
lying
tree
for
we
know
nothing
at
least
it
promised
knowledge
at
the
price
of
death
lucifer
answers
him
it
may
be
death
leads
to
the
highest
knowledge
that
is
to
say
to
nothingness
to
this
word
which
lord
byron
uses
in
the
above
quotations
the
spanish
the
french
the
german
is
often
opposed
the
word
sabiduria
sagesse
knowledge
comes
but
wisdom
lingers
and
he
bears
a
laden
breast
full
of
sad
experience
moving
toward
the
stillness
of
his
rest
says
another
lord
tennyson
in
his
and
what
is
this
wisdom
which
we
have
to
seek
chiefly
in
the
poets
leaving
knowledge
on
one
side
it
is
well
enough
to
say
with
matthew
arnold
in
his
introduction
to
wordsworth
poems
that
poetry
is
reality
and
philosophy
illusion
but
reason
is
always
reason
and
reality
is
always
reality
that
which
can
be
proved
to
exist
externally
to
us
whether
we
find
in
it
consolation
or
despair
i
do
not
know
why
so
many
people
were
scandalized
or
pretended
to
be
scandalized
when
brunetière
proclaimed
again
the
bankruptcy
of
science
for
science
as
a
substitute
for
religion
and
reason
as
a
substitute
for
faith
have
always
fallen
to
pieces
science
will
be
able
to
satisfy
and
in
fact
does
satisfy
in
an
increasing
measure
our
increasing
logical
or
intellectual
needs
our
desire
to
know
and
understand
the
truth
but
science
does
not
satisfy
the
needs
of
our
heart
and
our
will
and
far
from
satisfying
our
hunger
for
immortality
it
contradicts
it
rational
truth
and
life
stand
in
opposition
to
one
another
and
is
it
possible
that
there
is
any
other
truth
than
rational
truth
it
must
remain
established
therefore
that
reason
human
reason
within
its
limits
not
only
does
not
prove
rationally
that
the
soul
is
immortal
or
that
the
human
consciousness
shall
preserve
its
indestructibility
through
the
tracts
of
time
to
come
but
that
it
proves
rather
within
its
limits
i
repeat
that
the
individual
consciousness
can
not
persist
after
the
death
of
the
physical
organism
upon
which
it
depends
and
these
limits
within
which
i
say
that
human
reason
proves
this
are
the
limits
of
rationality
of
what
is
known
by
demonstration
beyond
these
limits
is
the
irrational
which
whether
it
be
called
the
or
the
or
the
is
all
the
same
thing
beyond
these
limits
is
the
absurd
of
tertullian
the
impossible
of
the
est
quia
impossibile
and
this
absurd
can
only
base
itself
upon
the
most
absolute
uncertainty
the
rational
dissolution
ends
in
dissolving
reason
itself
it
ends
in
the
most
absolute
scepticism
in
the
phenomenalism
of
hume
or
in
the
doctrine
of
absolute
contingencies
of
stuart
mill
the
most
consistent
and
logical
of
the
positivists
the
supreme
triumph
of
reason
the
analytical
that
is
the
destructive
and
dissolvent
faculty
is
to
cast
doubt
upon
its
own
validity
the
stomach
that
contains
an
ulcer
ends
by
digesting
itself
and
reason
ends
by
destroying
the
immediate
and
absolute
validity
of
the
concept
of
truth
and
of
the
concept
of
necessity
both
concepts
are
relative
there
is
no
absolute
truth
no
absolute
necessity
we
call
a
concept
true
which
agrees
with
the
general
system
of
all
our
concepts
and
we
call
a
perception
true
which
does
not
contradict
the
system
of
our
perceptions
truth
is
coherence
but
as
regards
the
whole
system
the
aggregate
as
there
is
nothing
outside
of
it
of
which
we
have
knowledge
we
can
not
say
whether
it
is
true
or
not
it
is
conceivable
that
the
universe
as
it
exists
in
itself
outside
of
our
consciousness
may
be
quite
other
than
it
appears
to
us
although
this
is
a
supposition
that
has
no
meaning
for
reason
and
as
regards
necessity
is
there
an
absolute
necessity
by
necessary
we
mean
merely
that
which
is
and
in
so
far
as
it
is
for
in
another
more
transcendental
sense
what
absolute
necessity
logical
and
independent
of
the
fact
that
the
universe
exists
is
there
that
there
should
be

anything

at
all
absolute
relativism
which
is
neither
more
nor

than
scepticism
in
the
most
modern
sense
of
the
term
is
the
supreme
triumph
of
the
reasoning
reason
feeling
does
not
succeed
in
converting
consolation
into
truth
nor
does
reason
succeed
in
converting
truth
into
consolation
but
reason
going
beyond
truth
itself
beyond
the
concept
of
reality
itself
succeeds
in
plunging
itself
into
the
depths
of
scepticism
and
in
this
abyss
the
scepticism
of
the
reason
encounters
the
despair
of
the
heart
and
this
encounter
leads
to
the
discovery
of
a
basis
a
terrible
basis
for
consolation
to
build
on

in
the

of

unicæ

we
have
seen
that
the
vital
longing
for
human
immortality
finds
no
consolation
in
reason
and
that
reason
leaves
us
without
incentive
or
consolation
in
life
and
life
itself
without
real
finality
but
here
in
the
depths
of
the
abyss
the
despair
of
the
heart
and
of
the
will
and
the
scepticism
of
reason
meet
face
to
face
and
embrace
like
brothers
and
we
shall
see
it
is
from
this
embrace
a
tragic
that
is
to
say
an
intimately
loving
embrace
that
the
wellspring
of
life
will
flow
a
life
serious
and
terrible
scepticism
uncertainty
the
position
to
which
reason
by
practising
its
analysis
upon
itself
upon
its
own
validity
at
last
arrives
is
the
foundation
upon
which
the
despair
must
build
up
its
hope
disillusioned
we
had
to
abandon
the
position
of
those
who
seek
to
give
consolation
the
force
of
rational
and
logical
truth
pretending
to
prove
the
rationality
or
at
any
rate
the
of
consolation
and
we
had
to
abandon
likewise
the
position
of
those
who
seek
to
give
rational
truth
the
force
of
consolation
and
of
a
motive
for
life
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
of
these
positions
satisfied
us
the
one
is
at
variance
with
our
reason
the
other
with
our
feeling
these
two
powers
can
never
conclude
peace
and
we
must
needs
live
by
their
war
we
must
make
of
this
war
of
war
itself
the
very
condition
of
our
spiritual
life
neither
does
this
high
debate
admit
of
that
indecent
and
repugnant
expedient
which
the
more
or
less
parliamentary
type
of
politician
has
devised
and
dubbed
a
formula
of
agreement
the
property
of
which
is
to
render
it
impossible
for
either
side
to
claim
to
be
victorious
there
is
no
place
here
for
a
compromise
perhaps
a
degenerate
and
cowardly
reason
might
bring
itself
to
propose
some
such
formula
of
agreement
for
in
truth
reason
lives
by
formulas
but
life
which
can
not
be
formulated
life
which
lives
and
seeks
to
live
for
ever
does
not
submit
to
formulas
its
sole
formula
is
all
or
nothing
feeling
does
not
compound
its
differences
with
middle
terms
sapientiæ
timor
it
is
said
meaning
perhaps
or
it
may
be
which
is
the
same
thing
always
it
comes
about
that
the
beginning
of
wisdom
is
a
fear
is
it
true
to
say
of
this
saving
scepticism
which
i
am
now
going
to
discuss
that
it
is
doubt
it
is
doubt
yes
but
it
is
much
more
than
doubt
doubt
is
commonly
something
very
cold
of
very
little
vitalizing
force
and
above
all
something
rather
artificial
especially
since
descartes
degraded
it
to
the
function
of
a
method
the
conflict
between
reason
and
life
is
something
more
than
a
doubt
for
doubt
is
easily
resolved
into
a
comic
element
the
methodical
doubt
of
descartes
is
a
comic
doubt
a
doubt
purely
theoretical
and
provisional
that
is
to
say
the
doubt
of
a
man
who
acts
as
if
he
doubted
without
really
doubting
and
because
it
was
a
doubt
the
man
who
deduced
that
he
existed
from
the
fact
that
he
thought
did
not
approve
of
those
turbulent
and
restless
persons
who
being
called
neither
by
birth
nor
by
fortune
to
the
management
of
public
affairs
are
perpetually
devising
some
new
reformation
and
he
was
pained
by
the
suspicion
that
there
might
be
something
of
this
kind
in
his
own
writings
no
he
descartes
proposed
only
to
reform
his
own
thoughts
and
to
build
upon
ground
that
was
wholly
his
and
he
resolved
not
to
accept
anything
as
true
when
he
did
not
recognize
it
clearly
to
be
so
and
to
make
a
clean
sweep
of
all
prejudices
and
received
ideas
to
the
end
that
he
might
construct
his
intellectual
habitation
anew
but
as
it
is
not
enough
before
beginning
to
rebuild
one
to
pull
it
down
and
to
furnish
materials
and
architects
or
to
study
architecture
oneself
but
it
is
also
necessary
to
be
provided
with
some
other
wherein
to
lodge
conveniently
while
the
work
is
in
progress
he
framed
for
himself
a
provisional
ethic
morale
de
the
first
law
of
which
was
to
observe
the
customs
of
his
country
and
to
keep
always
to
the
religion
in
which
by
the
grace
of
god
he
had
been
instructed
from
his
infancy
governing
himself
in
all
things
according
to
the
most
moderate
opinions
yes
exactly
a
provisional
religion
and
even
a
provisional
god
and
he
chose
the
most
moderate
opinions
because
these
are
always
the
most
convenient
for
practice
but
it
is
best
to
proceed
no
further
this
methodical
or
theoretical
cartesian
doubt
this
philosophical
doubt
excogitated
in
a
stove
is
not
the
doubt
is
not
the
scepticism
is
not
the
incertitude
that
i
am
talking
about
here
no
this
other
doubt
is
a
passionate
doubt
it
is
the
eternal
conflict
between
reason
and
feeling
science
and
life
logic
and
biotic
for
science
destroys
the
concept
of
personality
by
reducing
it
to
a
complex
in
continual
flux
from
moment
to
moment
that
is
to
say
it
destroys
the
very
foundation
of
the
spiritual
and
emotional
life
which
ranges
itself
unyieldingly
against
reason
and
this
doubt
can
not
avail
itself
of
any
provisional
ethic
but
has
to
found
its
ethic
as
we
shall
see
on
the
conflict
itself
an
ethic
of
battle
and
itself
has
to
serve
as
the
foundation
of
religion
and
it
inhabits
a
house
which
is
continually
being
demolished
and
which
continually
it
has
to
rebuild
without
ceasing
the
will
i
mean
the
will
never
to
die
the
spirit
of
unsubmissiveness
to
death
labours
to
build
up
the
house
of
life
and
without
ceasing
the
keen
blasts
and
stormy
assaults
of
reason
beat
it
down
and
more
than
this
in
the
concrete
vital
problem
that
concerns
us
reason
takes
up
no
position
whatever
in
truth
it
does
something
worse
than
deny
the
immortality
of
the
soul
for
that
at
any
rate
would
be
one
solution
it
refuses
even
to
recognize
the
problem
as
our
vital
desire
presents
it
to
us
in
the
rational
and
logical
sense
of
the
term
problem
there
is
no
such
problem
this
question
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
of
the
persistence
of
the
individual
consciousness
is
not
rational
it
falls
outside
reason
as
a
problem
and
whatever
solution
it
may
receive
it
is
irrational
rationally
even
the
very
propounding
of
the
problem
lacks
sense
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
as
unconceivable
as
in
all
strictness
is
its
absolute
mortality
for
the
purpose
of
explaining
the
world
and
existence
and
such
is
the
task
of
reason
it
is
not
necessary
that
we
should
suppose
that
our
soul
is
either
mortal
or
immortal
the
mere
enunciation
of
the
problem
is
therefore
an
irrationality
let
us
hear
what
our
brother
kierkegaard
has
to
say
the
danger
of
abstract
thought
is
seen
precisely
in
respect
of
the
problem
of
existence
the
difficulty
of
which
it
solves
by
going
round
it
afterwards
boasting
that
it
has
completely
explained
it
it
explains
immortality
in
general
and
it
does
so
in
a
remarkable
way
by
identifying
it
with
eternity
with
the
eternity
which
is
essentially
the
medium
of
thought
but
with
the
immortality
of
each
individually
existing
man
wherein
precisely
the
difficulty
lies
abstraction
does
not
concern
itself
is
not
interested
in
it
and
yet
the
difficulty
of
existence
lies
just
in
the
interest
of
the
existing
being
the
man
who
exists
is
infinitely
interested
in
existing
abstract
thought
besteads
immortality
only
in
order
that
it
may
kill
me
as
an
individual
being
with
an
individual
existence
and
so
make
me
immortal
pretty
much
in
the
same
way
as
that
famous
physician
in
one
of
holberg
plays
whose
medicine
while
it
took
away
the
patient
fever
took
away
his
life
at
the
same
time
an
abstract
thinker
who
refuses
to
disclose
and
admit
the
relation
that
exists
between
his
abstract
thought
and
the
fact
that
he
is
an
existing
being
produces
a
comic
impression
upon
us
however
accomplished
and
distinguished
he
may
be
for
he
runs
the
risk
of
ceasing
to
be
a
man
while
an
effective
man
compounded
of
infinitude
and
finitude
owes
his
effectiveness
precisely
to
the
conjunction
of
these
two
elements
and
is
infinitely
interested
in
existing
an
abstract
thinker
similarly
compounded
is
a
double
being
a
fantastical
being
who
lives
in
the
pure
being
of
abstraction
and
at
times
presents
the
sorry
figure
of
a
professor
who
lays
aside
this
abstract
essence
as
he
lays
aside
his
when
one
reads
the
life
of
a
thinker
of
this
kind
whose
writings
may
be
excellent
one
trembles
at
the
thought
of
what
it
is
to
be
a
man
and
when
one
reads
in
his
writings
that
thinking
and
being
are
the
same
thing
one
thinks
remembering
his
life
that
that
being
which
is
identical
with
thinking
is
not
precisely
the
same
thing
as
being
a
man
uvidenskabelig
chap
what
intense
passion
that
is
to
say
what
truth
there
is
in
this
bitter
invective
against
hegel
prototype
of
the
rationalist
for
the
rationalist
takes
away
our
fever
by
taking
away
our
life
and
promises
us
instead
of
a
concrete
an
abstract
immortality
as
if
the
hunger
for
immortality
that
consumes
us
were
an
abstract
and
not
a
concrete
hunger
it
may
indeed
be
said
that
when
once
the
dog
is
dead
there
is
an
end
to
the
rabies
and
that
after
i
have
died
i
shall
no
more
be
tortured
by
this
rage
of
not
dying
and
that
the
fear
of
death
or
more
properly
of
nothingness
is
an
irrational
fear
but
yes
but
si
muove
and
it
will
go
on
moving
for
it
is
the
source
of
all
movement
i
doubt
however
whether
our
brother
kierkegaard
is
altogether
in
the
right
for
this
same
abstract
thinker
or
thinker
of
abstractions
thinks
order
he
may
exist
that
he
may
not
cease
to
exist
or
thinks
perhaps
in
order
to
forget
that
he
will
have
to
cease
to
exist
this
is
the
root
of
the
passion
for
abstract
thought
and
possibly
hegel
was
as
infinitely
interested
as
kierkegaard
in
his
own
concrete
individual
existence
although
the
professional
decorum
of
the
compelled
him
to
conceal
the
fact
faith
in
immortality
is
irrational
and
notwithstanding
faith
life
and
reason
have
mutual
need
of
one
another
this
vital
longing
is
not
properly
a
problem
can
not
assume
a
logical
status
can
not
be
formulated
in
propositions
susceptible
of
rational
discussion
but
it
announces
itself
in
us
as
hunger
announces
itself
neither
can
the
wolf
that
throws
itself
with
the
fury
of
hunger
upon
its
prey
or
with
the
fury
of
instinct
upon
the
enunciate
its
impulse
rationally
and
as
a
logical
problem
reason
and
faith
are
two
enemies
neither
of
which
can
maintain
itself
without
the
other
the
irrational
demands
to
be
rationalized
and
reason
only
can
operate
on
the
irrational
they
are
compelled
to
seek
mutual
support
and
association
but
association
in
struggle
for
struggle
is
a
mode
of
association
in
the
world
of
living
beings
the
struggle
for
life
establishes
an
association
and
a
very
close
one
not
only
between
those
who
unite
together
in
combat
against
a
common
foe
but
between
the
combatants
themselves
and
is
there
any
possible
association
more
intimate
than
that
uniting
the
animal
that
eats
another
and
the
animal
that
is
eaten
between
the
devourer
and
the
devoured
and
if
this
is
clearly
seen
in
the
struggle
between
individuals
it
is
still
more
evident
in
the
struggle
between
peoples
war
has
always
been
the
most
effective
factor
of
progress
even
more
than
commerce
it
is
through
war
that
conquerors
and
conquered
learn
to
know
each
other
and
in
consequence
to
love
each
other
christianity
the
foolishness
of
the
cross
the
irrational
faith
that
christ
rose
from
the
dead
in
order
to
raise
us
from
the
dead
was
saved
by
the
rationalistic
hellenic
culture
and
this
in
its
turn
was
saved
by
christianity
without
christianity
the
renaissance
would
have
been
impossible
without
the
gospel
without
paul
the
peoples
who
had
traversed
the
middle
ages
would
have
understood
neither
plato
nor
aristotle
a
purely
rationalist
tradition
is
as
impossible
as
a
tradition
purely
religious
it
is
frequently
disputed
whether
the
reformation
was
born
as
the
child
of
the
renaissance
or
as
a
protest
against
it
and
both
propositions
may
be
said
to
be
true
for
the
son
is
always
born
as
a
protest
against
the
father
it
is
also
said
that
it
was
the
revived
greek
classics
that
led
men
like
erasmus
back
to
paul
and
to
primitive
christianity
which
is
the
most
irrational
form
of
christianity
but
it
may
be
retorted
that
it
was
paul
that
it
was
the
christian
irrationality
underlying
his
catholic
theology
that
led
them
back
to
the
classics
christianity
is
what
it
has
come
to
be
it
has
been
said
only
through
its
alliance
with
antiquity
while
with
the
copts
and
ethiopians
it
is
but
a
kind
of
buffoonery
islam
developed
under
the
influence
of
persian
and
greek
culture
and
under
that
of
the
turks
it
has
been
transformed
into
a
destructive
barbarism
we
have
emerged
from
the
middle
ages
from
the
medieval
faith
as
ardent
as
it
was
at
heart
despairing
and
not
without
its
inward
and
abysmal
incertitudes
and
we
have
entered
upon
the
age
of
rationalism
likewise
not
without
its
incertitudes
faith
in
reason
is
exposed
to
the
same
rational
indefensibility
as
all
other
faith
and
we
may
say
with
robert
browning
all
we
have
gained
then
by
our
unbelief
is
a
life
of
doubt
diversified
by
faith
for
one
of
faith
diversified
by
doubt
blougram
and
if
as
i
have
said
faith
life
can
only
sustain
itself
by
leaning
upon
reason
which
renders
it
transmissible
and
above
all
transmissible
from
myself
to
myself
that
is
to
say
reflective
and
conscious
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
reason
in
its
turn
can
only
sustain
itself
by
leaning
upon
faith
upon
life
even
if
only
upon
faith
in
reason
faith
in
its
availability
for
something
more
than
mere
knowing
faith
in
its
availability
for
living
nevertheless
neither
is
faith
transmissible
or
rational
nor
is
reason
vital
the
will
and
the
intelligence
have
need
of
one
another
and
the
reverse
of
that
old
aphorism
volitum
quin
nothing
is
willed
but
what
is
previously
known
is
not
so
paradoxical
as
at
first
sight
it
may
appear
cognitum
quin
nothing
is
known
but
what
is
previously
willed
vinet
in
his
study
of
cousin
book
on
the
of
pascal
says
the
very
knowledge
of
the
mind
as
such
has
need
of
the
heart
without
the
desire
to
see
there
is
no
seeing
in
a
great
materialization
of
life
and
of
thought
there
is
no
believing
in
the
things
of
the
spirit
we
shall
see
presently
that
to
believe
is
in
the
first
instance
to
wish
to
believe
the
will
and
the
intelligence
seek
opposite
ends
that
we
may
absorb
the
world
into
ourselves
appropriate
it
to

aim
of
the

that
we
may

opposite

they
not
rather
one

the

no
they

not
although
they
may
seem
to
be

the
intelligence
is
monist

the

monotheist
or
egoist
the
intelligence
has
no
need
of
anything
outside
it
to
exercise
itself
upon
it

its
foundation
with

themselves

the

this
something

to

myself
of

it

philosophy
and
religion
are
enemies
and
because
they
are
enemies
they
have
need
of
one
another
there
is
no
religion
without
some
philosophic
basis
no
philosophy
without
roots
in
religion
each
lives
by
its
contrary
the
history
of
philosophy
is
strictly
speaking
a
history
of
religion
and
the
attacks
which
are
directed
against
religion
from
a
presumed
scientific
or
philosophical
point
of
view
are
merely
attacks
from
another
but
opposing
religious
point
of
view
the
opposition
which
professedly
exists
between
natural
science
and
christianity
really
exists
between
an
impulse
derived
from
natural
religion
blended
with
the
scientific
investigation
of
nature
and
the
validity
of
the
christian
view
of
the
world
which
assures
to
spirit
its
over
the
entire
world

now
this
instinct
is
the
instinct
of
rationality
itself
and
the
critical
idealism
of
kant
is
of
religious
origin
and
it
is
in
order
to
save
religion
that
kant
enlarged
the
limits
of
reason
after
having
in
a
certain
sense
dissolved
it
in
scepticism
the
system
of
antitheses
contradictions
and
antinomies
upon
which
hegel
constructed
his
absolute
idealism
has
its
root
and
germ
in
kant
himself
and
this
root
is
an
irrational
root
we
shall
see
later
on
when
we
come
to
deal
with
faith
that
faith
is
in
its
essence
simply
a
matter
of
will
not
of
reason
that
to
believe
is
to
wish
to
believe
and
to
believe
in
god
is
before
all
and
above
all
to
wish
that
there
may
be
a
god
in
the
same
way
to
believe
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
to
wish
that
the
soul
may
be
immortal
but
to
wish
it
with
such
force
that
this
volition
shall
trample
reason
under
foot
and
pass
beyond
it
but
reason
has
its
revenge
the
instinct
of
knowing
and
the
instinct
of
living
or
rather
of
surviving
come
into
conflict
in
his
work
on
the
of
the
sensations
and
the
relation
of
the
physical
to
the
mach
tells
us
that
not
even
the
investigator
the
savant
is
exempted
from
taking
his
part
in
the
struggle
for
existence
that
even
the
roads
of
science
lead
and
that
in
the
actual
conditions
of
the
society
in
which
we
live
the
pure
instinct
of
knowing
reine
is
still
no
more
than
an
ideal
and
so
it
always
will
be
vivere
deinde
or
perhaps
better
or
every
position
of
permanent
agreement
or
harmony
between
reason
and
life
between
philosophy
and
religion
becomes
impossible
and
the
tragic
history
of
human
thought
is
simply
the
history
of
a
struggle
between
reason
and
life
reason
bent
on
rationalizing
life
and
forcing
it
to
submit
to
the
inevitable
to
mortality
life
bent
on
vitalizing
reason
and
forcing
it
to
serve
as
a
support
for
its
own
vital
desires
and
this
is
the
history
of
philosophy
inseparable
from
the
history
of
religion
our
sense
of
the
world
of
objective
reality
is
necessarily
subjective
human
anthropomorphic
and
vitalism
will
always
rise
up
against
rationalism
reason
will
always
find
itself
confronted
by
will
hence
the
rhythm
of
the
history
of
philosophy
and
the
alternation
of
periods
in
which
life
imposes
itself
giving
birth
to
spiritual
forms
with
those
in
which
reason
imposes
itself
giving
birth
to
materialist
forms
although
both
of
these
classes
of
forms
of
belief
may
be
disguised
by
other
names
neither
reason
nor
life
ever
acknowledges
itself
vanquished
but
we
will
return
to
this
in
the
next
chapter
the
vital
consequence
of
rationalism
would
be
suicide
kierkegaard
puts
it
very
well
the
consequence
for
existence
of
pure
thought
is
suicide
we
do
not
praise
suicide
but
passion
the
thinker
on
the
contrary
is
a
curious
animal
for
a
few
spells
during
the
day
he
is
very
intelligent
but
for
the
rest
he
has
nothing
in
common
with
man
uvidenskabelig
chap
as
the
thinker
in
spite
of
all
does
not
cease
to
be
a
man
he
employs
reason
in
the
interests
of
life
whether
he
knows
it
or
not
life
cheats
reason
and
reason
cheats
life
philosophy
fabricated
in
the
interest
of
life
a
system
rational
in
appearance
which
might
serve
as
a
support
for
our
vital
longing
this
philosophy
the
basis
of
the
orthodox
christian
supernaturalism
whether
catholic
or
protestant
was
in
its
essence
merely
a
trick
on
the
part
of
life
to
force
reason
to
lend
it
its
support
but
reason
supported
it
with
such
pressure
that
it
ended
by
pulverizing
it
i
have
read
that
the
hyacinthe
loyson
declared
that
he
could
present
himself
before
god
with
tranquillity
for
he
was
at
peace
with
his
conscience
and
with
his
reason
with
what
conscience
if
with
his
religious
conscience
then
i
do
not
understand
for
it
is
a
truth
that
no
man
can
serve
two
masters
and
least
of
all
when
though
they
may
sign
truces
and
armistices
and
compromises
these
two
are
enemies
because
of
their
conflicting
interests
to
all
this
someone
is
sure
to
object
that
life
ought
to
subject
itself
to
reason
to
which
we
will
reply
that
nobody
ought
to
do
what
he
is
unable
to
do
and
life
can
not
subject
itself
to
reason
ought
therefore
can
some
kantian
will
retort
to
which
we
shall
demur
can
not
therefore
ought
not
and
life
can
not
submit
itself
to
reason
because
the
end
of
life
is
living
and
not
understanding
again
there
are
those
who
talk
of
the
religious
duty
of
resignation
to
mortality
this
is
indeed
the
very
summit
of
aberration
and
insincerity
but
someone
is
sure
to
oppose
the
idea
of
veracity
to
that
of
sincerity
granted
and
yet
the
two
may
very
well
be
reconciled
veracity
the
homage
i
owe
to
what
i
believe
to
be
rational
to
what
logically
we
call
truth
moves
me
to
affirm
in
this
case
that
the
immortality
of
the
individual
soul
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
that
it
is
something
not
only
irrational
but
but
sincerity
leads
me
to
affirm
also
my
refusal
to
resign
myself
to
this
previous
affirmation
and
my
protest
against
its
validity
what
i
feel
is
a
truth
at
any
rate
as
much
a
truth
as
what
i
see
touch
hear
or
what
is
demonstrated
to
me
nay
i
believe
it
is
more
of
a
truth
and
sincerity
obliges
me
not
to
hide
what
i
feel
and
life
quick
to
defend
itself
searches
for
the
weak
point
in
reason
and
finds
it
in
scepticism
which
it
straightway
fastens
upon
seeking
to
save
itself
by
means
of
this
stranglehold
it
needs
the
weakness
of
its
adversary
nothing
is
sure
everything
is
elusive
and
in
the
air
in
an
outburst
of
passion
lamennais
exclaims
but
what
shall
we
losing
all
hope
shut
our
eyes
and
plunge
into
the
voiceless
depths
of
a
universal
scepticism
shall
we
doubt
that
we
think
that
we
feel
that
we
are
nature
does
not
allow
it
she
forces
us
to
believe
even
when
our
reason
is
not
convinced
absolute
certainty
and
absolute
doubt
are
both
alike
forbidden
to
us
we
hover
in
a
vague
mean
between
these
two
extremes
as
between
being
and
nothingness
for
complete
scepticism
would
be
the
extinction
of
the
intelligence
and
the
total
death
of
man
but
it
is
not
given
to
man
to
annihilate
himself
there
is
in
him
something
which
invincibly
resists
destruction
i
know
not
what
vital
faith
indomitable
even
by
his
will
whether
he
likes
it
or
not
he
must
believe
because
he
must
act
because
he
must
preserve
himself
his
reason
if
he
listened
only
to
that
teaching
him
to
doubt
everything
itself
included
would
reduce
him
to
a
state
of
absolute
inaction
he
would
perish
before
even
he
had
been
able
to
prove
to
himself
that
he
existed

reason
however
does
not

lead
us

not

properly
to

to
deny

my

scepticism
is
produced
by
the
clash
between
reason
and
desire
and
from
this
clash
from
this
embrace
between
despair
and
scepticism
is
born
that
holy
that
sweet
that
saving
incertitude
which
is
our
supreme
consolation
the
absolute
and
complete
certainty
on
the
one
hand
that
death
is
a
complete
definite
irrevocable
annihilation
of
personal
consciousness
a
certainty
of
the
same
order
as
the
certainty
that
the
three
angles
of
a
triangle
are
equal
to
two
right
angles
or
on
the
other
hand
the
absolute
and
complete
certainty
that
our
personal
consciousness
is
prolonged
beyond
death
in
these
present
or
in
other
conditions
and
above
all
including
in
itself
that
strange
and
adventitious
addition
of
eternal
rewards
and
punishments
both
of
these
certainties
alike
would
make
life
impossible
for
us
in
the
most
secret
chamber
of
the
spirit
of
him
who
believes
himself
convinced
that
death
puts
an
end
to
his
personal
consciousness
his
memory
for
ever
and
all
unknown
to
him
perhaps
there
lurks
a
shadow
a
vague
shadow
a
shadow
of
shadow
of
uncertainty
and
while
he
says
within
himself
well
let
us
live
this
life
that
passes
away
for
there
is
no
other
the
silence
of
this
secret
chamber
speaks
to
him
and
murmurs
who
knows
he
may
not
think
he
hears
it
but
he
hears
it
nevertheless
and
likewise
in
some
secret
place
of
the
soul
of
the
believer
who
most
firmly
holds
the
belief
in
a
future
life
there
is
a
muffled
voice
a
voice
of
uncertainty
which
whispers
in
the
ear
of
his
spirit
who
knows
these
voices
are
like
the
humming
of
a
mosquito
when
the
wind
roars
through
the
trees
in
the
wood
we
can
not
distinguish
this
faint
humming
yet
nevertheless
merged
in
the
clamour
of
the
storm
it
reaches
the
ear
otherwise
without
this
uncertainty
how
could
we
live
is
there
is
there
not
these
are
the
bases
of
our
inner
life
there
may
be
a
rationalist
who
has
never
wavered
in
his
conviction
of
the
mortality
of
the
soul
and
there
may
be
a
vitalist
who
has
never
wavered
in
his
faith
in
immortality
but
at
the
most
this
would
only
prove
that
just
as
there
are
natural
monstrosities
so
there
are
those
who
are
stupid
as
regards
heart
and
feeling
however
great
their
intelligence
and
those
who
are
stupid
intellectually
however
great
their
virtue
but
in
normal
cases
i
can
not
believe
those
who
assure
me
that
never
not
in
a
fleeting
moment
not
in
the
hours
of
direst
loneliness
and
grief
has
this
murmur
of
uncertainty
breathed
upon
their
consciousness
i
do
not
understand
those
men
who
tell
me
that
the
prospect
of
the
yonder
side
of
death
has
never
tormented
them
that
the
thought
of
their
own
annihilation
never
disquiets
them
for
my
part
i
do
not
wish
to
make
peace
between
my
heart
and
my
head
between
my
faith
and
my
reason
i
wish
rather
that
there
should
be
war
between
them
in
the
ninth
chapter
of
the
gospel
according
to
mark
it
is
related
how
a
man
brought
unto
jesus
his
son
who
was
possessed
by
a
dumb
spirit
and
wheresoever
the
spirit
took
him
it
tore
him
causing
him
to
foam
and
gnash
his
teeth
and
pine
away
wherefore
he
sought
to
bring
him
to
jesus
that
he
might
cure
him
and
the
master
impatient
of
those
who
sought
only
for
signs
and
wonders
exclaimed
o
faithless
generation
how
long
shall
i
be
with
you
how
long
shall
i
suffer
you
bring
him
unto
me
ver
and
they
brought
him
unto
him
and
when
the
master
saw
him
wallowing
on
the
ground
he
asked
his
father
how
long
it
was
ago
since
this
had
come
unto
him
and
the
father
replied
that
it
was
since
he
was
child
and
jesus
said
unto
him
if
thou
canst
believe
all
things
are
possible
to
him
that
believeth
ver
and
then
the
father
of
the
epileptic

demoniac

these
pregnant
and
immortal
words

contradiction
seemingly
for
if
he
believes
if
he
trusts
how
is
it
that
he
beseeches
the
lord
to
help
his
lack
of
trust
nevertheless
it
is
this
contradiction
that
gives
to
the
heart
cry
of
the
father
of
the
demoniac
its
most
profound
human
value
his
faith
is
a
faith
that
is
based
upon
incertitude
because
he
believes
that
is
to
say
because
he
wishes
to
believe
because
he
has
need
that
his
son
should
be
cured
he
beseeches
the
lord
to
help
his
unbelief
his
doubt
that
such
a

could
be
effected

such
kind

only
if

been
stupid
would
he
have
believed
without
a
shadow

the
follies
of
his
master

master

mad

he
was
at

of
despair

and
because
he
was
a
man
of
an
heroical
despair
the
hero
of
that
inward
and
resigned
despair
he
stands
as
the
eternal
exemplar
of
every
man

of

our
lord

is
the
prototype

the
prototype
of
the
rationalist
who
doubts

torturing
doubts

of
reason
was
that
abyss
that
terrible
before
which
pascal
trembled
and
it
was
that
which
led
him
to
pronounce
his
terrible
sentence
faut
need
is
that
we
become
fools
all
jansenism
the
catholic
adaptation
of
calvinism
bears
the
same
impress
which
owed
its
existence
to
a
basque
the
abbé
de
a
man
of
the
same
race
as
iñigo
de
loyola
and
as
he
who
writes
these
lines
always
preserved
deep
down
a
sediment
of
religious
despair
of
the
suicide
of
reason
loyola
also
slew
his
reason
in
obedience
our
affirmation
is
despair
our
negation
is
despair
and
from
despair
we
abstain
from
affirming
and
denying
note
the
greater
part
of
our
atheists
and
you
will
see
that
they
are
atheists
from
a
kind
of
rage
rage
at
not
being
able
to
believe
that
there
is
a
god
they
are
the
personal
enemies
of
god
they
have
invested
nothingness
with
substance
and
personality
and
their
is
an
and
concerning
that
abject
and
ignoble
saying
if
there
were
not
a
god
it
would
be
necessary
to
invent
him
we
shall
say
nothing
it
is
the
expression
of
the
unclean
scepticism
of
those
conservatives
who
look
upon
religion
merely
as
a
means
of
government
and
whose
interest
it
is
that
in
the
other
life
there
shall
be
a
hell
for
those
who
oppose
their
worldly
interests
in
this
life
this
repugnant
and
sadducean
phrase
is
worthy
of
the
sceptic
to
whom
it
is
attributed
no
with
all
this
the
deep
vital
sense
has
nothing
to
do
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
transcendental
police
regimen
or
with
securing
order
and
what
an
order
upon
earth
by
means
of
promises
and
threats
of
eternal
rewards
and
punishments
after
death
all
this
belongs
to
a
lower
plane
that
is
to
say
it
is
merely
politics
or
if
you
like
ethics
the
vital
sense
has
to
do
with
living
but
it
is
in
our
endeavour
to
represent
to
ourselves
what
the
life
of
the
soul
after
death
really
means
that
uncertainty
finds
its
surest
foundation
this
it
is
that
most
shakes
our
vital
desire
and
most
intensifies
the
dissolvent
efficacy
of
reason
for
even
if
by
a
mighty
effort
of
faith
we
overcome
that
reason
which
tells
and
teaches
us
that
the
soul
is
only
a
function
of
the
physical
organism
it
yet
remains
for
our
imagination
to
conceive
an
image
of
the
immortal
and
eternal
life
of
the
soul
this
conception
involves
us
in
contradictions
and
absurdities
and
it
may
be
that
we
shall
arrive
with
kierkegaard
at
the
conclusion
that
if
the
mortality
of
the
soul
is
terrible
not
less
terrible
is
its
immortality
but
when
we
have
overcome
the
first
the
only
real
difficulty
when
we
have
overcome
the
impediment
of
reason
when
we
have
achieved
the
faith
however
painful
and
involved
in
uncertainty
it
may
be
that
our
personal
consciousness
shall
continue
after
death
what
difficulty
what
impediment
lies
in
the
way
of
our
imagining
to
ourselves
this
persistence
of
self
in
harmony
with
our
desire
yes
we
can
imagine
it
as
an
eternal
rejuvenescence
as
an
eternal
growth
of
ourselves
and
as
a
journeying
towards
god
towards
the
universal
consciousness
without
ever
an
arrival
we
can
imagine
it
as
but
who
shall
put
fetters
upon
the
imagination
once
it
has
broken
the
chain
of
the
rational
i
know
that
all
this
is
dull
reading
tiresome
perhaps
tedious
but
it
is
all
necessary
and
i
must
repeat
once
again
that
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
transcendental
police
system
or
with
the
conversion
of
god
into
a
great
judge
or
policeman
that
is
to
say
we
are
not
concerned
with
heaven
or
hell
considered
as
buttresses
to
shore
up
our
poor
earthly
morality
nor
are
we
concerned
with
anything
egoistic
or
personal
it
is
not
i
myself
alone
it
is
the
whole
human
race
that
is
involved
it
is
the
ultimate
finality
of
all
our
civilization
i
am
but
one
but
all
men
are
i
do
you
remember
the
end
of
that
of
the
wild
which
leopardi
wrote
in
prose
the
despairing
leopardi
the
victim
of
reason
who
never
succeeded
in
achieving
belief
a
time
will
come
he
says
when
this
universe
and
nature
itself
will
be
extinguished
and
just
as
of
the
grandest
kingdoms
and
empires
of
mankind
and
the
marvellous
things
achieved
therein
very
famous
in
their
own
time
no
vestige
or
memory
remains
so
in
like
manner
of
the
entire
world
and
of
the
vicissitudes
and
calamities
of
all
created
things
there
will
remain
not
a
single
trace
but
a
naked
silence
and
a
most
profound
stillness
will
fill
the
immensity
of
space
and
so
before
ever
it
has
been
uttered
or
understood
this
admirable
and
fearful
secret
of
universal
existence
will
be
obliterated
and
lost
and
this
they
now
describe
by
a
scientific
and
very
rationalistic
term
namely
very
pretty
is
it
not
spencer
invented
the
notion
of
a
primordial
homogeneity
from
which
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
how
any
heterogeneity
could
originate
well
now
this
is
a
kind
of
ultimate
homogeneity
a
state
of
perfect
equilibrium
for
a
soul
avid
of
life
it
is
the
most
like
nothingness
that
the
mind
can
conceive
to
this
point
through
a
series
of
dolorous
reflections
i
have
brought
the
reader
who
has
had
the
patience
to
follow
me
endeavouring
always
to
do
equal
justice
to
the
claims
of
reason
and
of
feeling
i
have
not
wished
to
keep
silence
on
matters
about
which
others
are
silent
i
have
sought
to
strip
naked
not
only
my
own
soul
but
the
human
soul
be
its
nature
what
it
may
its
destiny
to
disappear
or
not
to
disappear
and
we
have
arrived
at
the
bottom
of
the
abyss
at
the
irreconcilable
conflict
between
reason
and
vital
feeling
and
having
arrived
here
i
have
told
you
that
it
is
necessary
to
accept
the
conflict
as
such
and
to
live
by
it
now
it
remains
for
me
to
explain
to
you
how
according
to
my
way
of
feeling
and
even
according
to
my
way
of
thinking
this
despair
may
be
the
basis
of
a
vigorous
life
of
an
efficacious
activity
of
an
ethic
of
an
esthetic
of
a
religion
and
even
of
a
logic
but
in
what
follows
there
will
be
as
much
of
imagination
as
of
ratiocination
or
rather
much
more
i
do
not
wish
to
deceive
anyone
or
to
offer
as
philosophy
what
it
may
be
is
only
poetry
or
phantasmagoria
in
any
case
a
kind
of
mythology
the
divine
plato
after
having
discussed
the
immortality
of
the
soul
in
his
dialogue
an
ideal
that
is
to
say
a
lying
immortality
embarked
upon
an
interpretation
of
the
myths
which
treat
of
the
other
life
remarking
that
it
was
also
necessary
to
mythologize
let
us
then
mythologize
he
who
looks
for
reasons
strictly
so
called
scientific
arguments
technically
logical
reflections
may
refuse
to
follow
me
further
throughout
the
remainder
of
these
reflections
upon
the
tragic
sense
i
am
going
to
fish
for
the
attention
of
the
reader
with
the
naked
unbaited
hook
whoever
wishes
to
bite
let
him
bite
but
i
deceive
no
one
only
in
the
conclusion
i
hope
to
gather
everything
together
and
to
show
that
this
religious
despair
which
i
have
been
talking
about
and
which
is
nothing
other
than
the
tragic
sense
of
life
itself
is
though
more
or
less
hidden
the
very
foundation
of
the
consciousness
of
civilized
individuals
and
peoples
that
is
to
say
of
those
individuals
and
those
peoples
who
do
not
suffer
from
stupidity
of
intellect
or
stupidity
of
feeling
and
this
tragic
sense
is
the
spring
of
heroic
achievements
if
in
that
which
follows
you
shall
meet
with
arbitrary
apothegms
brusque
transitions
inconsecutive
statements
veritable
somersaults
of
thought
do
not
cry
out
that
you
have
been
deceived
we
are
about
to
enter
if
it
be
that
you
wish
to
accompany
me
upon
a
field
of
contradictions
between
feeling
and
reasoning
and
we
shall
have
to
avail
ourselves
of
the
one
as
well
as
of
the
other
that
which
follows
is
not
the
outcome
of
reason
but
of
life
although
in
order
that
i
may
transmit
it
to
you
i
shall
have
to
rationalize
it
after
a
fashion
the
greater
part
of
it
can
be
reduced
to
no
logical
theory
or
system
but
like
that
tremendous
yankee
poet
walt
whitman
i
charge
that
there
be
no
theory
or
school
founded
out
of
me
and
neither
am
i
the
only
begetter
of
the
fancies
i
am
about
to
set
forth
by
no
means
they
have
also
been
conceived
by
other
men
if
not
precisely
by
other
thinkers
who
have
preceded
me
in
this
vale
of
tears
and
who
have
exhibited
their
life
and
given
expression
to
it
their
life
i
repeat
not
their
thought
save
in
so
far
as
it
was
thought
inspired
by
life
thought
with
a
basis
of
irrationality
does
this
mean
that
in
all
that
follows
in
the
efforts
of
the
irrational
to
express
itself
there
is
a
total
lack
of
rationality
of
all
objective
value
no
the
absolutely
the
irrevocably
irrational
is
inexpressible
is
intransmissible
but
not
the
perhaps
there
is
no
way
of
rationalizing
the
irrational
but
there
is
a
way
of
rationalizing
the
and
that
is
by
trying
to
explain
it
since
only
the
rational
is
intelligible
really
intelligible
and
since
the
absurd
being
devoid
of
sense
is
condemned
to
be
incommunicable
you
will
find
that
whenever
we
succeed
in
giving
expression
and
intelligibility
to
anything
apparently
irrational
or
absurd
we
invariably
resolve
it
into
something
rational
even
though
it
be
into
the
negation
of
that
which
we
affirm
the
maddest
dreams
of
the
fancy
have
some
ground
of
reason
and
who
knows
if
everything
that
the
imagination
of
man
can
conceive
either
has
not
already
happened
or
is
not
now
happening
or
will
not
happen
some
time
in
some
world
or
another
the
possible
combinations
are
perhaps
infinite
it
only
remains
to
know
whether
all
that
is
imaginable
is
possible
it
may
also
be
said
and
with
justice
that
much
of
what
i
am
about
to
set
forth
is
merely
a
repetition
of
ideas
which
have
been
expressed
a
hundred
times
before
and
a
hundred
times
refuted
but
the
repetition
of
an
idea
really
implies
that
its
refutation
has
not
been
final
and
as
i
do
not
pretend
that
the
majority
of
these
fancies
are
new
so
neither
do
i
pretend
obviously
that
other
voices
before
mine
have
not
spoken
to
the
winds
the
same
laments
but
when
yet
another
voice
echoes
the
same
eternal
lament
it
can
only
be
inferred
that
the
same
grief
still
dwells
in
the
heart
and
it
comes
not
amiss
to
repeat
yet
once
again
the
same
eternal
lamentations
that
were
already
old
in
the
days
of
job
and
ecclesiastes
and
even
to
repeat
them
in
the
same
words
to
the
end
that
the
devotees
of
progress
may
see
that
there
is
something
that
never
dies
whosoever
repeats
the
vanity
of
vanities
of
ecclesiastes
or
the
lamentations
of
job
even
though
without
changing
a
letter
having
first
experienced
them
in
his
soul
performs
a
work
of
admonition
need
is
to
repeat
without
ceasing
the
but
to
what
end
you
will
ask
even
though
it
be
only
to
the
end
that
some
people
should
be
irritated
and
should
see
that
these
things
are
not
dead
and
so
long
as
men
exist
can
not
die
to
the
end
that
they
should
be
convinced
that
in
the
twentieth
century
all
the
bygone
centuries
and
all
of
them
alive
are
still
subsisting
when
a
supposed
error
reappears
it
must
be
believe
me
that
it
has
not
ceased
to
be
true
in
part
just
as
when
one
who
was
dead
reappears
it
must
be
that
he
was
not
wholly
dead
yes
i
know
well
that
others
before
me
have
felt
what
i
feel
and
express
that
many
others
feel
it
although
they
keep
silence
about
it
why
do
i
not
keep
silence
about
it
too
well
for
the
very
reason
that
most
of
those
who
feel
it
are
silent
about
it
and
yet
though
they
are
silent
they
obey
in
silence
that
inner
voice
and
i
do
not
keep
silence
about
it
because
it
is
for
many
the
thing
which
must
not
be
spoken
the
abomination
of
abominations
and
i
believe
that
it
is
necessary
now
and
again
to
speak
the
thing
which
must
not
be
spoken
but
if
it
leads
to
nothing
even
if
it
should
lead
only
to
irritating
the
devotees
of
progress
those
who
believe
that
truth
is
consolation
it
would
lead
to
not
a
little
to
irritating
them
and
making
them
say
poor
fellow
if
he
would
only
use
his
intelligence
to
better
purpose
someone
perhaps
will
add
that
i
do
not
know
what
i
say
to
which
i
shall
reply
that
perhaps
he
may
be
right
and
being
right
is
such
a
little
thing
but
that
i
feel
what
i
say
and
i
know
what
i
feel
and
that
suffices
me
and
that
it
is
better
to
be
lacking
in
reason
than
to
have
too
much
of
it
and
the
reader
who
perseveres
in
reading
me
will
also
see
how
out
of
this
abyss
of
despair
hope
may
arise
and
how
this
critical
position
may
be
the
of
human
profoundly
human
action
and
effort
and
of
solidarity
and
even
of
progress
he
will
see
its
pragmatic
justification
and
he
will
see
how
in
order
to
work
and
to
work
efficaciously
and
morally
there
is
no
need
of
either
of
these
two
conflicting
certainties
either
that
of
faith
or
that
of
reason
and
how
still
less
is
there
any
need
this
never
under
any
circumstances
to
shirk
the
problem
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
or
to
distort
it
idealistically
that
is
to
say
hypocritically
the
reader
will
see
how
this
uncertainty
with
the
suffering
that
accompanies
it
and
the
fruitless
struggle
to
escape
from
it
may
be
and
is
a
basis
for
action
and
morals
and
in
the
fact
that
it
serves
as
a
basis
for
action
and
morals
this
feeling
of
uncertainty
and
the
inward
struggle
between
reason
on
the
one
hand
and
faith
and
the
passionate
longing
for
eternal
life
on
the
other
should
find
their
justification
in
the
eyes
of
the
pragmatist
but
it
must
be
clearly
stated
that
i
do
not
adduce
this
practical
consequence
in
order
to
justify
the
feeling
but
merely
because
i
encounter
it
in
my
inward
experience
i
neither
desire
to
seek
nor
ought
i
to
seek
any
justification
for
this
state
of
inward
struggle
and
uncertainty
and
longing
it
is
a
fact
and
that
suffices
and
if
anyone
finding
himself
in
this
state
in
the
depth
of
the
abyss
fails
to
find
there
motives
for
and
incentives
to
life
and
action
and
concludes
by
committing
bodily
or
spiritual
suicide
whether
he
kills
himself
or
he
abandons
all
with
his
fellows
in
human
endeavour
it
will
not
be
i
who
will
pass
censure
upon
him
and
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
evil
consequences
of
a
doctrine
or
rather
those
which
we
call
evil
only
prove
i
repeat
that
the
doctrine
is
disastrous
for
our
desires
but
not
that
it
is
false
in
itself
the
consequences
themselves
depend
not
so
much
upon
the
doctrine
as
upon
him
who
deduces
them
the
same
principle
may
furnish
one
man
with
grounds
for
action
and
another
man
with
grounds
for
abstaining
from
action
it
may
lead
one
man
to
direct
his
effort
towards
a
certain
end
and
another
man
towards
a
directly
opposite
end
for
the
truth
is
that
our
doctrines
are
usually
only
the
justification
of
our
conduct
or
else
they
are
our
way
of
trying
to
explain
that
conduct
to
ourselves
man
in
effect
is
unwilling
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
the
motives
of
his
own
conduct
and
just
as
a
man
who
has
been
led
to
perform
a
certain
action
by
hypnotic
suggestion
will
afterwards
invent
reasons
which
would
justify
it
and
make
it
appear
logical
to
himself
and
others
being
unaware
all
the
time
of
the
real
cause
of
his
action
so
every
man
for
since
life
is
a
dream
every
man
is
in
a
condition
of
hypnotism
seeks
to
find
reasons
for
his
conduct
and
if
the
pieces
on
a
chessboard
were
endowed
with
consciousness
they
would
probably
have
little
difficulty
in
ascribing
their
moves
to
freewill
that
is
to
say
they
would
claim
for
them
a
finalist
rationality
and
thus
it
comes
about
that
every
philosophic
theory
serves
to
explain
and
justify
an
ethic
a
doctrine
of
conduct
which
has
its
real
origin
in
the
inward
moral
feeling
of
the
author
of
the
theory
but
he
who
harbours
this
feeling
may
possibly
himself
have
no
clear
consciousness
of
its
true
reason
or
cause
consequently
if
my
reason
which
is
in
a
certain
sense
a
part
of
the
reason
of
all
my
brothers
in
humanity
in
time
and
space
teaches
me
this
absolute
scepticism
in
respect
of
what
concerns
my
longing
for
life
i
think
that
i
can
assume
that
my
feeling
of
life
which
is
the
essence
of
life
itself
my
vitality
my
boundless
appetite
for
living
and
my
abhorrence
of
dying
my
refusal
to
submit
to
death
that
it
is
this
which
suggests
to
me
the
doctrines
with
which
i
try
to
the
working
of
the
reason
have
these
doctrines
an
objective
value
someone
will
ask
me
and
i
shall
answer
that
i
do
not
understand
what
this
objective
value
of
a
doctrine
is
i
will
not
say
that
the
more
or
less
poetical
and
unphilosophical
doctrines
that
i
am
about
to
set
forth
are
those
which
make
me
live
but
i
will
venture
to
say
that
it
is
my
longing
to
live
and
to
live
for
ever
that
inspires
these
doctrines
within
me
and
if
by
means
of
them
i
succeed
in
strengthening
and
sustaining
this
same
longing
in
another
perhaps
when
it
was
all
but
dead
then
i
shall
have
performed
a
man
work
and
above
all
i
shall
have
lived
in
a
word
be
it
with
reason
or
without
reason
or
against
reason
i
am
resolved
not
to
die
and
if
when
at
last
i
die
out
i
die
out
altogether
then
i
shall
not
have
died
out
of
myself
that
is
i
shall
not
have
yielded
myself
to
death
but
my
human
destiny
will
have
killed
me
unless
i
come
to
lose
my
head
or
rather
my
heart
i
will
not
abdicate
from
life
life
will
be
wrested
from
me
to
have
recourse
to
those
ambiguous
words
optimism
and
pessimism
does
not
assist
us
in
any
way
for
frequently
they
express
the
very
contrary
of
what
those
who
use
them
mean
to
express
to
ticket
a
doctrine
with
the
label
of
pessimism
is
not
to
impugn
its
validity
and
the
optimists
are
not
the
most
efficient
in
action
i
believe
on
the
contrary
that
many
of
the
greatest
heroes
perhaps
the
greatest
of
all
have
been
men
of
despair
and
that
by
despair
they
have
accomplished
their
mighty
works
apart
from
this
however
and
accepting
in
all
their
ambiguity
these
denominations
of
optimism
and
pessimism
that
there
exists
a
certain
transcendental
pessimism
which
may
be
the
begetter
of
a
temporal
and
terrestrial
optimism
is
a
matter
that
i
propose
to
develop
in
the
following
part
of
this
treatise
very
different
well
i
know
is
the
attitude
of
our
progressives
the
partisans
of
the
central
current
of
contemporary
european
thought
but
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
that
these
individuals
do
not
voluntarily
close
their
eyes
to
the
grand
problem
of
existence
and
that
in
endeavouring
to
stifle
this
feeling
of
the
tragedy
of
life
they
themselves
are
not
living
a
lie
the
foregoing
reflections
are
a
kind
of
practical
summary
of
the
criticism
developed
in
the
first
six
chapters
of
this
treatise
a
kind
of
definition
of
the
practical
position
to
which
such
a
criticism
is
capable
of
leading
whosoever
will
not
renounce
life
and
will
not
renounce
reason
and
who
is
compelled
to
live
and
act
between
these
upper
and
nether
millstones
which
grind
upon
the
soul
the
reader
who
follows
me
further
is
now
aware
that
i
am
about
to
carry
him
into
the
region
of
the
imagination
of
imagination
not
destitute
of
reason
for
without
reason
nothing
subsists
but
of
imagination
founded
on
feeling
and
as
regards
its
truth
the
real
truth
that
which
is
independent
of
ourselves
beyond
the
reach
of
our
logic
and
of
our
heart
of
this
truth
who
knows
aught

love
seeks
with
fury
through
the
medium
of
the
beloved
something
beyond
and
since
it
finds
it
not
it
despairs
whenever
we
speak
of
love
there
is
always
present
in
our
memory
the
idea
of
sexual
love
the
love
between
man
and
woman
whose
end
is
the
perpetuation
of
the
human
race
upon
the
earth
hence
it
is
that
we
never
succeed
in
reducing
love
either
to
a
purely
intellectual
or
to
a
purely
volitional
element
putting
aside
that
part
in
it
which
belongs
to
the
feeling
or
if
you
like
to
the
senses
for
in
its
essence
love
is
neither
idea
nor
volition
rather
it
is
desire
feeling
it
is
something
carnal
in
spirit
itself
thanks
to
love
we
feel
all
that
spirit
has
of
flesh
in
it
sexual
love
is
the
generative
type
of
every
other
love
in
love
and
by
love
we
seek
to
perpetuate
ourselves
and
we
perpetuate
ourselves
on
the
earth
only
on
condition
that
we
die
that
we
yield
up
our
life
to
others
the
humblest
forms
of
animal
life
the
lowest
of
living
beings
multiply
by
dividing
themselves
by
splitting
into
two
by
ceasing
to
be
the
unit
which
they
previously
formed
but
when
at
last
the
vitality
of
the
being
that
multiplies
itself
by
division
is
exhausted
the
species
must
renew
the
source
of
life
from
time
to
time
by
means
of
the
union
of
two
wasting
individuals
by
means
of
what
is
called
among
protozoaria
conjugation
they
unite
in
order
to
begin
dividing
again
with
more
vigour
and
every
act
of
generation
consists
in
a
being
ceasing
to
be
what
it
was
either
wholly
or
in
part
in
a
splitting
up
in
a
partial
death
to
live
is
to
give
oneself
to
perpetuate
oneself
and
to
perpetuate
oneself
and
to
give
oneself
is
to
die
the
supreme
delight
of
begetting
is
perhaps
nothing
but
a
foretaste
of
death
the
eradication
of
our
own
vital
essence
we
unite
with
another
but
it
is
to
divide
ourselves
this
most
intimate
embrace
is
only
a
most
intimate
sundering
in
its
essence
the
delight
of
sexual
love
the
genetic
spasm
is
a
sensation
of
resurrection
of
renewing
our
life
in
another
for
only
in
others
can
we
renew
our
life
and
so
perpetuate
ourselves
without
doubt
there
is
something
tragically
destructive
in
the
essence
of
love
as
it
presents
itself
to
us
in
its
primitive
animal
form
in
the
unconquerable
instinct
which
impels
the
male
and
the
female
to
mix
their
being
in
a
fury
of
conjunction
the
same
impulse
that
joins
their
bodies
separates
in
a
certain
sense
their
souls
they
hate
one
another
while
they
embrace
no
less
than
they
love
and
above
all
they
contend
with
one
another
they
contend
for
a
third
life
which
as
yet
is
without
life
love
is
a
contention
and
there
are
animal
species
in
which
the
male
maltreats
the
female
in
his
union
with
her
and
other
in
which
the
female
devours
the
male
after
being
fertilized
by
him
it
has
been
said
that
love
is
a
mutual
selfishness
and
in
fact
each
one
of
the
lovers
seeks
to
possess
the
other
and
in
seeking
his
own
perpetuation
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
other
though
without
being
at
the
time
conscious
of
it
or
purposing
it
he
thereby
seeks
his
own
enjoyment
each
one
of
the
lovers
is
an
immediate
instrument
of
enjoyment
and
a
mediate
instrument
of
perpetuation
for
the
other
and
thus
they
are
tyrants
and
slaves
each
one
at
once
the
tyrant
and
slave
of
the
other
is
there
really
anything
strange
in
the
fact
that
the
deepest
religious
feeling
has
condemned
carnal
love
and
exalted
virginity
avarice
said
the
apostle
is
the
root
of
all
evil
and
the
reason
is
because
avarice
takes
riches
which
are
only
a
means
for
an
end
and
therein
lies
the
essence
of
sin
in
taking
means
for
ends
in
not
recognizing
or
in
disesteeming
the
end
and
since
it
takes
enjoyment
for
the
end
whereas
it
is
only
the
means
and
not
perpetuation
which
is
the
true
end
what
is
carnal
love
but
avarice
and
it
is
possible
that
there
are
some
who
preserve
their
virginity
in
order
the
better
to
perpetuate
themselves
and
in
order
to
perpetuate
something
more
human
than
the
flesh
for
it
is
the
suffering
flesh
it
is
suffering
it
is
death
that
lovers
perpetuate
upon
the
earth
love
is
at
once
the
brother
son
and
father
of
death
which
is
its
sister
mother
and
daughter
and
thus
it
is
that
in
the
depth
of
love
there
is
a
depth
of
eternal
despair
out
of
which
spring
hope
and
consolation
for
out
of
this
carnal
and
primitive
love
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
out
of
this
love
of
the
whole
body
with
all
its
senses
which
is
the
animal
origin
of
human
society
out
of
this
rises
spiritual
and
sorrowful
love
this
other
form
of
love
this
spiritual
love
is
born
of
sorrow
is
born
of
the
death
of
carnal
love
is
born
also
of
the
feeling
of
compassion
and
protection
which
parents
feel
in
the
presence
of
a
stricken
child
lovers
never
attain
to
a
love
of
self
abandonment
of
true
fusion
of
soul
and
not
merely
of
body
until
the
heavy
pestle
of
sorrow
has
bruised
their
hearts
and
crushed
them
in
the
same
mortar
of
suffering
sensual
love
joined
their
bodies
but
disjoined
their
souls
it
kept
their
souls
strangers
to
one
another
but
of
this
love
is
begotten
a
fruit
of
their
flesh
a
child
and
perchance
this
child
begotten
in
death
falls
sick
and
dies
then
it
comes
to
pass
that
over
the
fruit
of
their
carnal
fusion
and
spiritual
separation
and
estrangement
their
bodies
now
separated
and
cold
with
sorrow
but
united
by
sorrow
their
souls
the
lovers
the
parents
join
in
an
embrace
of
despair
and
then
is
born
of
the
death
of
the
child
of
their
flesh
the
true
spiritual
love
or
rather
when
the
bond
of
flesh
which
united
them
is
broken
they
breathe
with
a
sigh
of
relief
for
men
love
one
another
with
a
spiritual
love
only
when
they
have
suffered
the
same
sorrow
together
when
through
long
days
they
have
ploughed
the
stony
ground
bowed
beneath
the
common
yoke
of
a
common
grief
it
is
then
that
they
know
one
another
and
feel
one
another
and
feel
with
one
another
in
their
common
anguish
they
pity
one
another
and
love
one
another
for
to
love
is
to
pity
and
if
bodies
are
united
by
pleasure
souls
are
united
by
pain
and
this
is
felt
with
still
more
clearness
and
force
in
the
seeding
the
taking
root
and
the
blossoming
of
one
of
those
tragic
loves
which
are
doomed
to
contend
with
the
laws
of
destiny
one
of
those
loves
which
are
born
out
of
due
time
and
season
before
or
after
the
moment
or
out
of
the
normal
mode
in
which
the
world
which
is
custom
would
have
been
willing
to
welcome
them
the
more
barriers
destiny
and
the
world
and
its
law
interpose
between
the
lovers
the
stronger
is
the
impulse
that
urges
them
towards
one
another
and
their
happiness
in
loving
one
another
turns
to
bitterness
and
their
unhappiness
in
not
being
able
to
love
freely
and
openly
grows
heavier
and
they
pity
one
another
from
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
and
this
common
pity
which
is
their
common
misery
and
their
common
happiness
gives
fire
and
fuel
to
their
love
and
they
suffer
their
joy
enjoying
their
suffering
and
they
establish
their
love
beyond
the
confines
of
the
world
and
the
strength
of
this
poor
love
suffering
beneath
the
yoke
of
destiny
gives
them
intuition
of
another
world
where
there
is
no
other
law
than
the
liberty
of
love
another
world
where
there
are
no
barriers
because
there
is
no
flesh
for
nothing
inspires
us
more
with
hope
and
faith
in
another
world
than
the
impossibility
of
our
love
truly
fructifying
in
this
world
of
flesh
and
of
appearances
and
what
is
maternal
love
but
compassion
for
the
weak
helpless
defenceless
infant
that
craves
the
mother
milk
and
the
comfort
of
her
breast
and
woman
love
is
all
maternal
to
love
with
the
spirit
is
to
pity
and
he
who
pities
most
loves
most
men
aflame
with
a
burning
charity
towards
their
neighbours
are
thus
enkindled
because
they
have
touched
the
depth
of
their
own
misery
their
own
apparentiality
their
own
nothingness
and
then
turning
their
newly
opened
eyes
upon
their
fellows
they
have
seen
that
they
also
are
miserable
apparential
condemned
to
nothingness
and
they
have
pitied
them
and
loved
them
man
yearns
to
be
loved
or
what
is
the
same
thing
to
be
pitied
man
wishes
others
to
feel
and
share
his
hardships
and
his
sorrows
the
roadside
beggar
exhibition
of
his
sores
and
gangrened
mutilations
is
something
more
than
a
device
to
extort
alms
from
the
true
alms
is
pity
rather
than
the
pittance
that
alleviates
the
material
hardships
of
life
the
beggar
shows
little
gratitude
for
alms
thrown
to
him
by
one
who
hurries
past
with
averted
face
he
is
more
grateful
to
him
who
pities
him
but
does
not
help
than
to
him
who
helps
but
does
not
pity
although
from
another
point
of
view
he
may
prefer
the
latter
observe
with
what
satisfaction
he
relates
his
woes
to
one
who
is
moved
by
the
story
of
them
he
desires
to
be
pitied
to
be
loved
woman
love
above
all
as
i
have
remarked
is
always
compassionate
in
its
essence
maternal
woman
yields
herself
to
the
lover
because
she
feels
that
his
desire
makes
him
suffer
isabel

upon

woman
seems
to
say
come
poor
one
thou
shalt
not
suffer
so
for
my
sake
and
therefore
is
her
love
more
loving
and
purer
than
that
of
man
braver
and
more
enduring
pity
then
is
the
essence
of
human
spiritual
love
of
the
love
that
is
conscious
of
being
love
of
the
love
that
is
not
purely
animal
of
the
love
in
a
word
of
a
rational
person

and
pities
most
when
it

most
reversing
the
terms
of
the
adage
volitum
quin
i
have
told
you
that
cognitum
quin
that
we
know
nothing
save
what
we
have
first
in
one
way
or
another
desired
and
it
may
even
be
added
that
we
can
know
nothing
well
save
what
we
love
save
what
we
pity
as
love
grows
this
restless
yearning
to
pierce
to
the
uttermost
and
to
the
innermost
so
it
continually
embraces
all
that
it
sees
and
pities
all
that
it
embraces
according
as
you
turn
inwards
and
penetrate
more
deeply
into
yourself
you
will
discover
more
and
more
your
own
emptiness
that
you
are
not
all
that
you
are
not
that
you
are
not
what
you
would
wish
to
be
that
you
are
in
a
word
only
a
nonentity
and
in
touching
your
own
nothingness
in
not
feeling
your
permanent
base
in
not
reaching
your
own
infinity
still
less
your
own
eternity
you
will
have
a
pity
for
yourself
and
you
will
burn
with
a
sorrowful
love
for
yourself
a
love
that
will
consume
your
which
is
merely
a
species
of
sensual
the
as
it
were
of
the
flesh
of
your
soul
spiritual
the
pity
that
one
feels
for
oneself
may
perhaps
be
called
egotism
but
nothing
could
be
more
opposed
to
ordinary
egoism
for
this
love
or
pity
for
yourself
this
intense
despair
bred
of
the
consciousness
that
just
as
before
you
were
born
you
were
not
so
after
your
death
you
will
cease
to
be
will
lead
you
to
pity
that
is
to
love
all
your
fellows
and
brothers
in
this
world
of
appearance
these
unhappy
shadows
who
pass
from
nothingness
to
nothingness
these
sparks
of
consciousness
which
shine
for
a
moment
in
the
infinite
and
eternal
darkness
and
this
compassionate
feeling
for
other
men
for
your
fellows
beginning
with
those
most
akin
to
you
those
with
whom
you
live
will
expand
into
a
universal
pity
for
all
living
things
and
perhaps
even
for
things
that
have
not
life
but
merely
existence
that
distant
star
which
shines
up
there
in
the
night
will
some
day
be
quenched
and
will
turn
to
dust
and
will
cease
to
shine
and
cease
to
exist
and
so
too
it
will
be
with
the
whole
of
the
heavens
unhappy
heavens
and
if
it
is
grievous
to
be
doomed
one
day
to
cease
to
be
perhaps
it
would
be
more
grievous
still
to
go
on
being
always
oneself
and
no
more
than
oneself
without
being
able
to
be
at
the
same
time
other
without
being
able
to
be
at
the
same
time
everything
else
without
being
able
to
be
all
if
you
look
at
the
universe
as
closely
and
as
inwardly
as
you
are
able
to
look
that
is
to
say
if
you
look
within
yourself
if
you
not
only
contemplate
but
feel
all
things
in
your
own
consciousness
upon
which
all
things
have
traced
their
painful
impression
you
will
arrive
at
the
abyss
of
the
tedium
not
merely
of
life
but
of
something
more
at
the
tedium
of
existence
at
the
bottomless
pit
of
the
vanity
of
vanities
and
thus
you
will
come
to
pity
all
things
you
will
arrive
at
universal
love
in
order
to
love
everything
in
order
to
pity
everything
human
and
living
and
you
must
feel
everything
within
yourself
you
must
personalize
everything
for
everything
that
it
loves
everything
that
it
pities
love
personalizes
we
only
pity
that
is
to
say
we
only
love
that
which
is
like
ourselves
and
in
so
far
as
it
is
like
ourselves
and
the
more
like
it
is
the
more
we
love
and
thus
our
pity
for
things
and
with
it
our
love
grows
in
proportion
as
we
discover
in
them
the
likenesses
which
they
have
with
ourselves
or
rather
it
is
love
itself
which
of
itself
tends
to
grow
that
reveals
these
resemblances
to
us
if
i
am
moved
to
pity
and
love
the
luckless
star
that
one
day
will
vanish
from
the
face
of
heaven
it
is
because
love
pity
makes
me
feel
that
it
has
a
consciousness
more
or
less
dim
which
makes
it
suffer
because
it
is
no
more
than
a
star
and
a
star
that
is
doomed
one
day
to
cease
to
be
for
all
consciousness
is
consciousness
of
death
and
of
suffering
consciousness
is
participated
knowledge
is
and
is
love
personalizes
all
that
it
loves
only
by
personalizing
it
can
we
fall
in
love
with
an
idea
and
when
love
is
so
great
and
so
vital
so
strong
and
so
overflowing
that
it
loves
everything
then
it
personalizes
everything
and
discovers
that
the
total
all
that
the
universe
is
also
a
person
possessing
a
consciousness
a
consciousness
which
in
its
turn
suffers
pities
and
loves
and
therefore
is
consciousness
and
this
consciousness
of
the
universe
which
love
personalizing
all
that
it
loves
discovers
is
what
we
call
god
and
thus
the
soul
pities
god
and
feels
itself
pitied
by
him
loves
him
and
feels
itself
loved
by
him
sheltering
its
misery
in
the
bosom
of
the
eternal
and
infinite
misery
which
in
eternalizing
itself
and
infinitizing
itself
is
the
supreme
happiness
itself
god
is
then
the
personalization
of
the
all
he
is
the
eternal
and
infinite
consciousness
of
the
universe
consciousness
taken
captive
by
matter
and
struggling
to
free
himself
from
it
we
personalize
the
all
in
order
to
save
ourselves
from
nothingness
and
the
only
mystery
really
mysterious
is
the
mystery
of
suffering
suffering
is
the
path
of
consciousness
and
by
it
living
beings
arrive
at
the
possession
of
for
to
possess
consciousness
of
oneself
to
possess
personality
is
to
know
oneself
and
to
feel
oneself
distinct
from
other
beings
and
this
feeling
of
distinction
is
only
reached
through
an
act
of
collision
through
suffering
more
or
less
severe
through
the
sense
of
one
own
limits
consciousness
of
oneself
is
simply
consciousness
of
one
own
limitation
i
feel
myself
when
i
feel
that
i
am
not
others
to
know
and
to
feel
the
extent
of
my
being
is
to
know
at
what
point
i
cease
to
be
the
point
beyond
which
i
no
longer
am
and
how
do
we
know
that
we
exist
if
we
do
not
suffer
little
or
much
how
can
we
turn
upon
ourselves
acquire
reflective
consciousness
save
by
suffering
when
we
enjoy
ourselves
we
forget
ourselves
forget
that
we
exist
we
pass
over
into
another
an
alien
being
we
alienate
ourselves
and
we
become
centred
in
ourselves
again
we
return
to
ourselves
only
by
suffering
maggior
dolore
che
ricordarsi
del

felice
nella
are
the
words
that
dante
puts
into
the
mouth
of
francesca
da
rimini
but
if
there
is
no
greater
sorrow
than
the
recollection
in
adversity
of
happy
bygone
days
there
is
on
the
other
hand
no
pleasure
in
remembering
adversity
in
days
of
prosperity
the
bitterest
sorrow
that
man
can
know
is
to
aspire
to
do
much
and
to
achieve
nothing
phroneoita
mêdenos
so
herodotus
relates
that
a
persian
said
to
a
theban
at
a
banquet
book
chap
and
it
is
true
with
knowledge
and
desire
we
can
embrace
everything
or
almost
everything
with
the
will
nothing
or
almost
nothing
and
contemplation
is
not
happiness
no
not
if
this
contemplation
implies
impotence
and
out
of
this
collision
between
our
knowledge
and
our
power
pity
arises
we
pity
what
is
like
ourselves
and
the
greater
and
clearer
our
sense
of
its
likeness
with
ourselves
the
greater
our
pity
and
if
we
may
say
that
this
likeness
provokes
our
pity
it
may
also
be
maintained
that
it
is
our
reservoir
of
pity
eager
to
diffuse
itself
over
everything
that
makes
us
discover
the
likeness
of
things
with
ourselves
the
common
bond
that
unites
us
with
them
in
suffering
our
own
struggle
to
acquire
preserve
and
increase
our
own
consciousness
makes
us
discover
in
the
endeavours
and
movements
and
revolutions
of
all
things
a
struggle
to
acquire
preserve
and
increase
consciousness
to
which
everything
tends
beneath
the
actions
of
those
most
akin
to
myself
of
my
i
feel
or
rather
i
a
state
of
consciousness
similar
to
that
which
lies
beneath
my
own
actions
on
hearing
my
brother
give
a
cry
of
pain
my
own
pain
awakes
and
cries
in
the
depth
of
my
consciousness
and
in
the
same
way
i
feel
the
pain
of
animals
and
the
pain
of
a
tree
when
one
of
its
branches
is
being
cut
off
and
i
feel
it
most
when
my
imagination
is
alive
for
the
imagination
is
the
faculty
of
intuition
of
inward
vision
proceeding
from
ourselves
from
our
own
human
consciousness
the
only
consciousness
which
we
feel
from
within
and
in
which
feeling
is
identical
with
being
we
attribute
some
sort
of
consciousness
more
or
less
dim
to
all
living
things
and
even
to
the
stones
themselves
for
they
also
live
and
the
evolution
of
organic
beings
is
simply
a
struggle
to
realize
fullness
of
consciousness
through
suffering
a
continual
aspiration
to
be
others
without
ceasing
to
be
themselves
to
break
and
yet
to
preserve
their
proper
limits
and
this
process
of
personalization
or
subjectivization
of
everything
external
phenomenal
or
objective
is
none
other
than
the
vital
process
of
philosophy
in
the
contest
of
life
against
reason
and
of
reason
against
life
we
have
already
indicated
it
in
the
preceding
chapter
and
we
must
now
confirm
it
by
developing
it
further
giovanni
baptista
vico
with
his
profound
esthetic
penetration
into
the
soul
of
antiquity
saw
that
the
spontaneous
philosophy
of
man
was
to
make
of
himself
the
norm
of
the
universe
guided
by
the
language
necessarily
anthropomorphic
mythopeic
engenders
thought
poetic
wisdom
which
was
the
primitive
wisdom
of
paganism
says
vico
in
his
must
have
begun
with
a
metaphysic
not
reasoned
and
abstract
like
that
of
modern
educated
men
but
felt
and
imagined
such
as
must
have
been
that
of
primitive
men
this
was
their
own
poetry
which
with
them
was
inborn
an
innate
faculty
for
nature
had
furnished
them
with
such
feelings
and
such
imaginations
a
faculty
born
of
the
ignorance
of
causes
and
therefore
begetting
a
universal
sense
of
wonder
for
knowing
nothing
they
marvelled
greatly
at
everything
this
poetry
had
a
divine
origin
for
while
they
invented
the
causes
of
things
out
of
their
own
imagination
at
the
same
time
they
regarded
these
causes
with
feelings
of
wonder
as
gods
in
this
way
the
first
men
of
the
pagan
peoples
as
children
of
the
growing
human
race
fashioned
things
out
of
their
ideas
this
nature
of
human
things
has
bequeathed
that
eternal
property
which
tacitus
elucidated
with
a
fine
phrase
when
he
said
not
without
reason
that
men
in
their
terror
simul
and
then
passing
from
the
age
of
imagination
vico
proceeds
to
show
us
the
age
of
reason
this
age
of
ours
in
which
the
mind
even
the
popular
mind
is
too
remote
from
the
senses
with
so
many
abstractions
of
which
all
languages
are
full
an
age
in
which
the
ability
to
conceive
an
immense
image
of
such
a
personage
as
we
call
sympathetic
nature
is
denied
to
us
for
though
the
phrase
nature
may
be
on
our
lips
there
is
nothing
in
our
minds
that
corresponds
with
it
our
minds
being
occupied
with
the
false
the
vico
continues
it
is
naturally
impossible
for
us
to
enter
into
the
vast
imagination
of
these
primitive
men
but
is
this
certain
do
not
we
continue
to
live
by
the
creations
of
their
imagination
embodied
for
ever
in
the
language
with
which
we
think
or
rather
the
language
which
thinks
in
us
it
was
in
vain
that
comte
declared
that
human
thought
had
already
emerged
from
the
age
of
theology
and
was
now
emerging
from
the
age
of
metaphysics
into
the
age
of
positivism
the
three
ages
coexist
and
although
antagonistic
they
lend
one
another
mutual
support
positivism
whenever
it
ceases
to
deny
and
begins
to
affirm
something
whenever
it
becomes
really
positive
is
nothing
but
metaphysics
and
metaphysics
in
its
essence
is
always
theology
and
theology
is
born
of
imagination
yoked
to
the
service
of
life
of
life
with
its
craving
for
immortality
our
feeling
of
the
world
upon
which
is
based
our
understanding
of
it
is
necessarily
anthropomorphic
and
mythopeic
when
rationalism
dawned
with
thales
of
miletus
this
philosopher
abandoned
oceanus
and
thetis
gods
and
the
progenitors
of
gods
and
attributed
the
origin
of
things
to
water
but
this
water
was
a
god
in
disguise
beneath
nature
and
the
world
mythical
and
anthropomorphic
creations
throbbed
with
life
they
were
implicated
in
the
structure
of
language
itself
xenophon
tells
us
that
among
phenomena
socrates
distinguished
between
those
which
were
within
the
scope
of
human
study
and
those
which
the
gods
had
reserved
for
themselves
and
that
he
execrated
the
attempt
of
anaxagoras
to
explain
everything
rationally
his
contemporary
hippocrates
regarded
diseases
as
of
divine
origin
and
plato
believed
that
the
sun
and
stars
were
animated
gods
with
their
souls
cap
x
and
only
permitted
astronomical
investigation
so
long
as
it
abstained
from
blasphemy
against
these
gods
and
aristotle
in
his
tells
us
that
zeus
rains
not
in
order
that
the
corn
may
grow
but
by
necessity
they
tried
to
mechanize
and
rationalize
god
but
god
rebelled
against
them
and
what
is
the
concept
of
god
a
concept
continually
renewed
because
springing
out
of
the
eternal
feeling
of
god
in
man
but
the
eternal
protest
of
life
against
reason
the
unconquerable
instinct
of
personalization
and
what
is
the
notion
of
substance
itself
but
the
objectivization
of
that
which
is
most
subjective
that
is
of
the
will
or
consciousness
for
consciousness
even
before
it
knows
itself
as
reason
feels
itself
is
palpable
to
itself
is
most
in
harmony
with
itself
as
will
and
as
will
not
to
die
hence
that
rhythm
of
which
we
spoke
in
the
history
of
thought
positivism
inducted
us
into
an
age
of
rationalism
that
is
to
say
of
materialism
mechanism
or
mortalism
and
behold
now
the
return
of
vitalism
of
spiritualism
what
was
the
effort
of
pragmatism
but
an
effort
to
restore
faith
in
the
human
finality
of
the
universe
what
is
the
effort
of
a
bergson
for
example
especially
in
his
work
on
creative
evolution
but
an
attempt
to
the
personal
god
and
eternal
consciousness
life
never
surrenders
and
it
avails
us
nothing
to
seek
to
repress
this
mythopeic
or
anthropomorphic
process
and
to
rationalize
our
thought
as
if
we
thought
only
for
the
sake
of
thinking
and
knowing
and
not
for
the
sake
of
living
the
very
language
with
which
we
think
prevents
us
from
so
doing
language
the
substance
of
thought
is
a
system
of
metaphors
with
a
mythic
and
anthropomorphic
base
and
to
construct
a
purely
rational
philosophy
it
would
be
necessary
to
construct
it
by
means
of
algebraic
formulas
or
to
create
a
new
language
for
it
an
inhuman
language
that
is
to
say
one
inapt
for
the
needs
of
life
as
indeed
richard
avenarius
professor
of
philosophy
at
zürich
attempted
to
do
in
his
of
pure
experience
kritik
der
reinen
in
order
to
avoid
preconceptions
and
this
rigorous
attempt
of
avenarius
the
chief
of
the
critics
of
experience
ends
strictly
in
pure
scepticism
he
himself
says
at
the
end
of
the
prologue
to
the
work
above
mentioned
the
childish
confidence
that
it
is
granted
to
us
to
discover
truth
has
long
since
disappeared
as
we
progress
we
become
aware
of
the
difficulties
that
lie
in
the
way
of
its
discovery
and
of
the
limitation
of
our
powers
and
what
is
the
end
if
we
could
only
succeed
in
seeing
clearly
into
ourselves
seeing
clearly
seeing
clearly
clear
vision
would
be
only
attainable
by
a
pure
thinker
who
used
algebra
instead
of
language
and
was
able
to
divest
himself
of
his
own
humanity
that
is
to
say
by
an
unsubstantial
merely
objective
being
a
in
short
in
spite
of
reason
we
are
compelled
to
think
with
life
and
in
spite
of
life
we
are
compelled
to
rationalize
thought
this
animation
this
personification
interpenetrates
our
very
knowledge
who
is
it
that
sends
the
rain
who
is
it
that
thunders
old
strepsiades
asks
of
socrates
in
of
aristophanes
and
the
philosopher
replies
not
zeus
but
the
clouds
but
questions
strepsiades
who
but
zeus
makes
the
clouds
sweep
along
to
which
socrates
answers
not
a
bit
of
it
it
is
atmospheric
whirligig
whirligig
muses
strepsiades
i
never
thought
of
that
that
zeus
is
gone
and
that
son
whirligig
rules
now
in
his
stead
and
so
the
old
man
goes
on
personifying
and
animating
the
whirlwind
as
if
the
whirlwind
were
now
a
king
not
without
consciousness
of
his
kingship
and
in
exchanging
a
zeus
for
a
whirlwind
god
for
matter
for
example
we
all
do
the
same
thing
and
the
reason
is
because
philosophy
does
not
work
upon
the
objective
reality
which
we
perceive
with
the
senses
but
upon
the
complex
of
ideas
images
notions
perceptions
embodied
in
language
and
transmitted
to
us
with
our
language
by
our
ancestors
that
which
we
call
the
world
the
objective
world
is
a
social
tradition
it
is
given
to
us
ready
made
man
does
not
submit
to
being
as
consciousness
alone
in
the
universe
nor
to
being
merely
one
objective
phenomenon
the
more
he
wishes
to
save
his
vital
or
passional
subjectivity
by
attributing
life
personality
spirit
to
the
whole
universe
in
order
to
realize
his
wish
he
has
discovered
god
and
substance
god
and
substance
continually
reappear
in
his
thought
cloaked
in
different
disguises
because
we
are
conscious
we
feel
that
we
exist
which
is
quite
another
thing
from
knowing
that
we
exist
and
we
wish
to
feel
the
existence
of
everything
else
we
wish
that
of
all
the
other
individual
things
each
one
should
also
be
an
i
the
most
consistent
although
the
most
incongruous
and
vacillating
idealism
that
of
berkeley
who
denied
the
existence
of
matter
of
something
inert
and
extended
and
passive
as
the
cause
of
our
sensations
and
the
substratum
of
external
phenomena
is
in
its
essence
nothing
but
an
absolute
spiritualism
or
dynamism
the
supposition
that
every
sensation
comes
to
us
causatively
from
another
spirit
that
is
from
another
consciousness
and
his
doctrine
has
a
certain
affinity
with
those
of
schopenhauer
and
hartmann
the
former
doctrine
of
the
will
and
the
latter
doctrine
of
the
unconscious
are
already
implied
in
the
berkeleyan
theory
that
to
be
is
to
be
perceived
to
which
must
be
added
and
to
cause
others
to
perceive
what
is
thus
the
old
adage
sequitur
action
follows
being
must
be
modified
by
saying
that
to
be
is
to
act
and
only
that
which
acts
the
active
exists
and
in
so
far
as
it
acts
as
regards
schopenhauer
there
is
no
need
to
endeavour
to
show
that
the
will
which
he
posits
as
the
essence
of
things
proceeds
from
consciousness
and
it
is
only
necessary
to
read
his
book
on
the
will
in
nature
to
see
how
he
attributed
a
certain
spirit
and
even
a
certain
personality
to
the
plants
themselves
and
this
doctrine
of
his
carried
him
logically
to
pessimism
for
the
true
property
and
most
inward
function
of
the
will
is
to
suffer
the
will
is
a
force
which
feels
itself
that
is
which
suffers
and
someone
will
add
which
enjoys
but
the
capacity
to
enjoy
is
impossible
without
the
capacity
to
suffer
and
the
faculty
of
enjoyment
is
one
with
that
of
pain
whosoever
does
not
suffer
does
not
enjoy
just
as
whosoever
is
insensible
to
cold
is
insensible
to
heat
and
it
is
also
quite
logical
that
schopenhauer
who
deduced
pessimism
from
the
voluntarist
doctrine
or
doctrine
of
universal
personalization
should
have
deduced
from
both
of
these
that
the
foundation
of
morals
is
compassion
only
his
lack
of
the
social
and
historical
sense
his
inability
to
feel
that
humanity
also
is
a
person
although
a
collective
one
his
egoism
in
short
prevented
him
from
feeling
god
prevented
him
from
individualizing
and
personalizing
the
total
and
collective
will
the
will
of
the
universe
on
the
other
hand
it
is
easy
to
understand
his
aversion
from
purely
empirical
evolutionist
or
transformist
doctrines
such
as
those
set
forth
in
the
works
of
lamarck
and
darwin
which
came
to
his
notice
judging
darwin
theory
solely
by
an
extensive
extract
in
he
described
it
in
a
letter
to
adam
louis
von
doss
march
as
downright
empiricism
platter
empirismus
in
fact
for
a
voluntarist
like
schopenhauer
a
theory
so
sanely
and
cautiously
empirical
and
rational
as
that
of
darwin
left
out
of
account
the
inward
force
the
essential
motive
of
evolution
for
what
is
in
effect
the
hidden
force
the
ultimate
agent
which
impels
organisms
to
perpetuate
themselves
and
to
fight
for
their
persistence
and
propagation
selection
adaptation
heredity
these
are
only
external
conditions
this
inner
essential
force
has
been
called
will
on
the
supposition
that
there
exists
also
in
other
beings
that
which
we
feel
in
ourselves
as
a
feeling
of
will
the
impulse
to
be
everything
to
be
others
as
well
as
ourselves
yet
without
ceasing
to
be
what
we
are
and
it
may
be
said
that
this
force
is
the
divine
in
us
that
it
is
god
himself
who
works
in
us
because
he
suffers
in
us
and
sympathy
teaches
us
to
discover
this
force
this
aspiration
towards
consciousness
in
all
things
it
moves
and
activates
the
most
minute
living
creatures
it
moves
and
activates
perhaps
the
very
cells
of
our
own
bodily
organism
which
is
a
confederation
more
or
less
solidary
of
living
beings
it
moves
the
very
globules
of
our
blood
our
life
is
composed
of
lives
our
vital
aspiration
of
aspirations
existing
perhaps
in
the
limbo
of
subconsciousness
not
more
absurd
than
so
many
other
dreams
which
pass
as
valid
theories
is
the
belief
that
our
cells
our
globules
may
possess
something
akin
to
a
rudimentary
cellular
globular
consciousness
or
basis
of
consciousness
or
that
they
may
arrive
at
possessing
such
consciousness
and
since
we
have
given
a
loose
rein
to
the
fancy
we
may
fancy
that
these
cells
may
communicate
with
one
another
and
that
some
of
them
may
express
their
belief
that
they
form
part
of
a
superior
organism
endowed
with
a
collective
personal
consciousness
and
more
than
once
in
the
history
of
human
feeling
this
fancy
has
been
expressed
in
the
surmisal
of
some
philosopher
or
poet
that
we
men
are
a
kind
of
globules
in
the
blood
of
a
supreme
being
who
possesses
his
own
personal
collective
consciousness
the
consciousness
of
the
universe
perhaps
the
immense
milky
way
which
on
clear
nights
we
behold
stretching
across
the
heavens
this
vast
encircling
ring
in
which
our
planetary
system
is
itself
but
a
molecule
is
in
its
turn
but
a
cell
in
the
universe
in
the
body
of
god
all
the
cells
of
our
body
combine
and
in
maintaining
and
kindling
by
their
activity
our
consciousness
our
soul
and
if
the
consciousness
or
the
souls
of
all
these
cells
entered
completely
into
our
consciousness
into
the
composite
whole
if
i
possessed
consciousness
of
all
that
happens
in
my
bodily
organism
i
should
feel
the
universe
happening
within
myself
and
perhaps
the
painful
sense
of
my
limitedness
would
disappear
and
if
all
the
consciousness
of
all
beings
unite
in
their
entirety
in
the
universal
consciousness
this
consciousness
that
is
to
say
god
is
all
in
every
instant
obscure
consciousnesses
elementary
souls
are
born
and
die
within
us
and
their
birth
and
death
constitute
our
life
and
their
sudden
and
violent
death
constitutes
our
pain
and
in
like
manner
in
the
heart
of
god
consciousnesses
are
born
and
die
but
do
they
die
and
their
births
and
deaths
constitute
his
life
if
there
is
a
universal
and
supreme
consciousness
i
am
an
idea
in
it
and
is
it
possible
for
any
idea
in
this
supreme
consciousness
to
be
completely
blotted
out
after
i
have
died
god
will
go
on
remembering
me
and
to
be
remembered
by
god
to
have
my
consciousness
sustained
by
the
supreme
consciousness
is
not
that
perhaps
to
be
and
if
anyone
should
say
that
god
has
made
the
universe
it
may
be
rejoined
that
so
also
our
soul
has
made
our
body
as
much
as
if
not
more
than
it
has
been
made
by
it
if
indeed
there
be
a
soul
when
pity
love
reveals
to
us
the
whole
universe
striving
to
gain
to
preserve
and
to
enlarge
its
consciousness
striving
more
and
more
to
saturate
itself
with
consciousness
feeling
the
pain
of
the
discords
which
are
produced
within
it
pity
reveals
to
us
the
likeness
of
the
whole
universe
with
ourselves
it
reveals
to
us
that
it
is
human
and
it
leads
us
to
discover
our
father
in
it
of
whose
flesh
we
are
flesh
love
leads
us
to
personalize
the
whole
of
which
we
form
a
part
to
say
that
god
is
eternally
producing
things
is
fundamentally
the
same
as
saying
that
things
are
eternally
producing
god
and
the
belief
in
a
personal
and
spiritual
god
is
based
on
the
belief
in
our
own
personality
and
spirituality
because
we
feel
ourselves
to
be
consciousness
we
feel
god
to
be
consciousness
that
is
to
say
a
person
and
because
we
desire
ardently
that
our
consciousness
shall
live
and
be
independently
of
the
body
we
believe
that
the
divine
person
lives
and
exists
independently
of
the
universe
that
his
state
of
consciousness
is
no
doubt
logicians
will
come
forward
and
confront
us
with
the
evident
rational
difficulties
which
this
involves
but
we
have
already
stated
that
although
presented
under
logical
forms
the
content
of
all
this
is
not
strictly
rational
every
rational
conception
of
god
is
in
itself
contradictory
faith
in
god
is
born
of
love
for
god
we
believe
that
god
exists
by
force
of
wishing
that
he
may
exist
and
it
is
born
also
perhaps
of
god
love
for
us
reason
does
not
prove
to
us
that
god
exists
but
neither
does
it
prove
that
he
can
not
exist
but
of
this
conception
of
faith
in
god
as
the
personalization
of
the
universe
we
shall
have
more
to
say
presently
and
recalling
what
has
been
said
in
another
part
of
this
work
we
may
say
that
material
things
in
so
far
as
they
are
known
to
us
issue
into
knowledge
through
the
agency
of
hunger
and
out
of
hunger
issues
the
sensible
or
material
universe
in
which
we
conglomerate
these
things
and
that
ideal
things
issue
out
of
love
and
out
of
love
issues
god
in
whom
we
conglomerate
these
ideal
things
as
in
the
consciousness
of
the
universe
it
is
social
consciousness
the
child
of
love
of
the
instinct
of
perpetuation
that
leads
us
to
socialize
everything
to
see
society
in
everything
and
that
shows
us
at
last
that
all
nature
is
really
an
infinite
society
for
my
part
the
feeling
that
nature
is
a
society
has
taken
hold
of
me
hundreds
of
times
in
walking
through
the
woods
possessed
with
a
sense
of
solidarity
with
the
oaks
a
sense
of
their
dim
awareness
of
my
presence
imagination
which
is
the
social
sense
animates
the
inanimate
and
anthropomorphizes
everything
it
humanizes
everything
and
even
makes
everything
identical
with
man
and
the
work
of
man
is
to
supernaturalize
nature
that
is
to
say
to
make
it
divine
by
making
it
human
to
help
it
to
become
conscious
of
itself
in
short
the
action
of
reason
on
the
other
hand
is
to
mechanize
or
materialize
and
just
as
a
fruitful
union
is
consummated
between
the
individual
who
is
in
a
certain
sense
a
society
and
society
which
is
also
an
individual
the
two
being
so
inseparable
from
one
another
that
it
is
impossible
to
say
where
the
one
begins
and
the
other
ends
for
they
are
rather
two
aspects
of
a
single
essence
so
also
the
spirit
the
social
element
which
by
relating
us
to
others
makes
us
conscious
unites
with
matter
the
individual
and
individualizing
element
similarly
reason
or
intelligence
and
imagination
embrace
in
a
mutually
fruitful
union
and
the
universe
merges
into
one
with
god
is
all
this
true
and
what
is
truth
i
in
my
turn
will
ask
as
pilate
asked
not
however
only
to
turn
away
and
wash
my
hands
without
waiting
for
an
answer
is
truth
in
reason
or
above
reason
or
beneath
reason
or
outside
of
reason
in
some
way
or
another
is
only
the
rational
true
may
there
not
be
a
reality
by
its
very
nature
unattainable
by
reason
and
perhaps
by
its
very
nature
opposed
to
reason
and
how
can
we
know
this
reality
if
reason
alone
holds
the
key
to
knowledge
our
desire
of
living
our
need
of
life
asks
that
that
may
be
true
which
urges
us
to
and
which
sustains
man
and
society
it
asks
that
the
true
water
may
be
that
which
assuages
our
thirst
and
because
it
assuages
it
that
the
true
bread
may
be
that
which
satisfies
our
hunger
because
it
satisfies
it
the
senses
are
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
instinct
of
preservation
and
everything
that
satisfies
this
need
of
preserving
ourselves
even
though
it
does
not
pass
through
the
senses
is
nevertheless
a
kind
of
intimate
penetration
of
reality
in
us
is
the
process
of
assimilating
nutriment
perhaps
less
real
than
the
process
of
knowing
the
nutritive
substance
it
may
be
said
that
to
eat
a
loaf
of
bread
is
not
the
same
thing
as
seeing
touching
or
tasting
it
that
in
the
one
case
it
enters
into
our
body
but
not
therefore
into
our
consciousness
is
this
true
does
not
the
loaf
of
bread
that
i
have
converted
into
my
flesh
and
blood
enter
more
into
my
consciousness
than
the
other
loaf
which
i
see
and
touch
and
of
which
i
say
this
is
mine
and
must
i
refuse
objective
reality
to
the
bread
that
i
have
thus
converted
into
my
flesh
and
blood
and
made
mine
when
i
only
touch
it
there
are
some
who
live
by
air
without
knowing
it
in
the
same
way
it
may
be
we
live
by
god
and
in
god
in
god
the
spirit
and
consciousness
of
society
and
of
the
whole
universe
in
so
far
as
the
universe
is
also
a
society
god
is
felt
only
in
so
far
as
he
is
lived
and
man
does
not
live
by
bread
alone
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
god
matt
iv
deut
viii
and
this
personalization
of
the
all
of
the
universe
to
which
we
are
led
by
love
by
pity
is
the
personalization
of
a
person
who
embraces
and
comprehends
within
himself
the
other
persons
of
which
he
is
composed
the
only
way
to
give
finality
to
the
world
is
to
give
it
consciousness
for
where
there
is
no
consciousness
there
is
no
finality
finality
presupposing
a
purpose
and
as
we
shall
see
faith
in
god
is
based
simply
upon
the
vital
need
of
giving
finality
to
existence
of
making
it
answer
to
a
purpose
we
need
god
not
in
order
to
understand
the
but
in
order
to
feel
and
sustain
the
ultimate
to
give
a
meaning
to
the
universe
and
neither
ought
we
to
be
surprised
by
the
affirmation
that
this
consciousness
of
the
universe
is
composed
and
integrated
by
the
consciousnesses
of
the
beings
which
form
the
universe
by
the
consciousnesses
of
all
the
beings
that
exist
and
that
nevertheless
it
remains
a
personal
consciousness
distinct
from
those
which
compose
it
only
thus
is
it
possible
to
understand
how
in
god
we
live
move
and
have
our
being
that
great
visionary
emanuel
swedenborg
saw
or
caught
a
glimpse
of
this
in
his
book
on
heaven
and
hell
de
coelo
et
lii
when
he
tells
us
an
entire
angelic
society
appears
sometimes
in
the
form
of
a
single
angel
which
also
it
hath
been
granted
me
by
the
lord
to
see
when
the
lord
himself
appears
in
the
midst
of
the
angels
he
doth
not
appear
as
encompassed
by
a
multitude
but
as
a
single
being
in
angelic
form
hence
it
is
that
the
lord
in
the
word
is
called
an
angel
and
likewise
that
on
entire
society
is
so
called
michael
gabriel
and
raphael
are
nothing
but
angelical
societies
which
are
so
named
from
their
functions
may
we
not
perhaps
live
and
love
that
is
suffer
and
pity
in
this
supreme
person
we
all
the
persons
who
suffer
and
pity
and
all
the
beings
that
strive
to
achieve
personality
to
acquire
consciousness
of
their
suffering
and
their
limitation
and
are
we
not
perhaps
ideas
of
this
total
grand
consciousness
which
by
thinking
of
us
as
existing
confers
existence
upon
us
does
not
our
existence
consist
in
being
perceived
and
felt
by
god
and
further
on
this
same
visionary
tells
us
under
the
form
of
images
that
each
angel
each
society

god
does
not
think
he
creates
he
does
not
exist
he
is
eternal
wrote
kierkegaard
but
perhaps
it
is
more
exact
to
say
with
mazzini
the
mystic
of
the
italian
city
that
god
is
great
because
his
thought
is
action
giovani
because
with
him
to
think
is
to
create
and
he
gives
existence
to
that
which
exists
in
his
thought
by
the
mere
fact
of
thinking
it
and
the
impossible
is
the
unthinkable
by
god
is
it
not
written
in
the
scriptures
that
god
creates
with
his
word
that
is
to
say
with
his
thought
and
that
by
this
by
his
word
he
made
everything
that
exists
and
what
god
has
once
made
does
he
ever
forget
may
it
not
be
that
all
the
thoughts
that
have
ever
passed
through
the
supreme
consciousness
still
subsist
therein
in
him
who
is
eternal
is
not
all
existence
eternalized
our
longing
to
save
consciousness
to
give
personal
and
human
finality
to
the
universe
and
to
existence
is
such
that
even
in
the
midst
of
a
supreme
an
agonizing
and
lacerating
sacrifice
we
should
still
hear
the
voice
that
assured
us
that
if
our
consciousness
disappears
it
is
that
the
infinite
and
eternal
consciousness
may
be
enriched
thereby
that
our
souls
may
serve
as
nutriment
to
the
universal
soul
yes
i
enrich
god
because
before
i
existed
he
did
not
think
of
me
as
existing
because
i
am
one
more
one
more
even
though
among
an
infinity
of
others
who
having
really
lived
really
suffered
and
really
loved
abide
in
his
bosom
it
is
the
furious
longing
to
give
finality
to
the
universe
to
make
it
conscious
and
personal
that
has
brought
us
to
believe
in
god
to
wish
that
god
may
exist
to
create
god
in
a
word
to
create
him
yes
this
saying
ought
not
to
scandalize
even
the
most
devout
theist
for
to
believe
in
god
is
in
a
certain
sense
to
create
him
although
he
first
creates
us
it
is
he
who
in
us
is
continually
creating
himself
we
have
created
god
in
order
to
save
the
universe
from
nothingness
for
all
that
is
not
consciousness
and
eternal
consciousness
conscious
of
its
eternity
and
eternally
conscious
is
nothing
more
than
appearance
there
is
nothing
truly
real
save
that
which
feels
suffers
pities
loves
and
desires
save
consciousness
there
is
nothing
substantial
but
consciousness
and
we
need
god
in
order
to
save
consciousness
not
in
order
to
think
existence
but
in
order
to
live
it
not
in
order
to
know
the
why
and
how
of
it
but
in
order
to
feel
the
wherefore
of
it
love
is
a
contradiction
if
there
is
no
god
let
us
now
consider
this
idea
of
god
of
the
logical
god
or
the
supreme
reason
and
of
the
vital
god
or
the
god
of
the
heart
that
is
supreme

viii
from
god
to
god
to
affirm
that
the
religious
sense
is
a
sense
of
divinity
and
that
it
is
impossible
without
some
abuse
of
the
ordinary
usages
of
human
language
to
speak
of
an
atheistic
religion
is
not
i
think
to
do
violence
to
the
truth
although
it
is
clear
that
everything
will
depend
upon
the
concept
that
we
form
of
god
a
concept
which
in
its
turn
depends
upon
the
concept
of
divinity
our
proper
procedure
in
effect
will
be
to
begin
with
this
sense
of
divinity
before
prefixing
to
the
concept
of
this
quality
the
definite
article
and
the
capital
letter
and
so
converting
it
into
the
divinity
that
is
into
god
for
man
has
not
deduced
the
divine
from
god
but
rather
he
has
reached
god
through
the
divine
in
the
course
of
these
somewhat
wandering
but
at
the
same
time
urgent
reflections
upon
the
tragic
sense
of
life
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
fecit
of
statius
with
the
object
of
limiting
and
correcting
it
it
is
not
my
intention
to
trace
yet
once
again
the
historical
processes
by
which
peoples
have
arrived
at
the
consciousness
and
concept
of
a
personal
god
like
the
god
of
christianity
and
i
say
peoples
and
not
isolated
individuals
for
if
there
is
any
feeling
or
concept
that
is
truly
collective
and
social
it
is
the
feeling
and
concept
of
god
although
the
individual
subsequently
individualizes
it
philosophy
may
and
in
fact
does
possess
an
individual
origin
theology
is
necessarily
collective
schleiermacher
theory
which
attributes
the
origin
or
rather
the
essence
of
the
religious
sense
to
the
immediate
and
simple
feeling
of
dependency
appears
to
be
the
most
profound
and
exact
explanation
primitive
man
living
in
society
feels
himself
to
be
dependent
upon
the
mysterious
forces
invisibly
environing
him
he
feels
himself
to
be
in
social
communion
not
only
with
beings
like
himself
his
but
with
the
whole
of
nature
animate
and
inanimate
which
simply
means
in
other
words
that
he
personalizes
everything
not
only
does
he
possess
a
consciousness
of
the
world
but
he
imagines
that
the
world
like
himself
possesses
consciousness
also
just
as
a
child
talks
to
his
doll
or
his
dog
as
if
it
understood
what
he
was
saying
so
the
savage
believes
that
his
fetich
hears
him
when
he
speaks
to
it
and
that
the
angry
is
aware
of
him
and
deliberately
pursues
him
for
the
newly
born
mind
of
the
primitive
natural
man
has
not
yet
wholly
severed
itself
from
the
cords
which
still
bind
it
to
the
womb
of
nature
neither
has
it
clearly
marked
out
the
boundary
that
separates
dreaming
from
waking
imagination
from
reality
the
divine
therefore
was
not
originally
something
objective
but
was
rather
the
subjectivity
of
consciousness
projected
exteriorly
the
personalization
of
the
world
the
concept
of
divinity
arose
out
of
the
feeling
of
divinity
and
the
feeling
of
divinity
is
simply
the
dim
and
nascent
feeling
of
personality
vented
upon
the
outside
world
and
strictly
speaking
it
is
not
possible
to
speak
of
outside
and
inside
objective
and
subjective
when
no
such
distinction
was
actually
felt
indeed
it
is
precisely
from
this
lack
of
distinction
that
the
feeling
and
concept
of
divinity
proceed
the
clearer
our
consciousness
of
the
distinction
between
the
objective
and
the
subjective
the
more
obscure
is
the
feeling
of
divinity
in
us
it
has
been
said
and
very
justly
so
it
would
appear
that
hellenic
paganism
was
not
so
much
polytheistic
as
pantheistic
i
do
not
know
that
the
belief
in
a
multitude
of
gods
taking
the
concept
of
god
in
the
sense
in
which
we
understand
it
has
ever
really
existed
in
any
human
mind
and
if
by
pantheism
is
understood
the
doctrine
not
that
everything
and
each
individual
thing
is
god
a
proposition
which
i
find
unthinkable
but
that
everything
is
divine
then
it
may
be
said
without
any
great
abuse
of
language
that
paganism
was
pantheistic
its
gods
not
only
mixed
among
men
but
intermixed
with
them
they
begat
gods
upon
mortal
women
and
upon
goddesses
mortal
men
begat
and
if
that
is
were
believed
to
exist
it
was
because
the
divine
and
the
human
were
viewed
as
different
aspects
of
the
same
reality
the
divinization
of
everything
was
simply
its
humanization
to
say
that
the
sun
was
a
god
was
equivalent
to
saying
that
it
was
a
man
a
human
consciousness
more
or
less
aggrandized
and
sublimated
and
this
is
true
of
all
beliefs
from
fetichism
to
hellenic
paganism
the
real
distinction
between
gods
and
men
consisted
in
the
fact
that
the
former
were
immortal
a
god
came
to
be
identical
with
an
immortal
man
and
a
man
was
deified
reputed
as
a
god
when
it
was
deemed
that
at
his
death
he
had
not
really
died
of
certain
heroes
it
was
believed
that
they
were
alive
in
the
kingdom
of
the
dead
and
this
is
a
point
of
great
importance
in
estimating
the
value
of
the
concept
of
the
divine
in
those
republics
of
gods
there
was
always
some
predominating
god
some
real
monarch
it
was
through
the
agency
of
this
divine
monarchy
that
primitive
peoples
were
led
from
monocultism
to
monotheism
hence
monarchy
and
monotheism
are
twin
brethren
zeus
jupiter
was
in
process
of
being
converted
into
an
only
god
just
as
jahwé
originally
one
god
among
many
others
came
to
be
converted
into
an
only
god
first
the
god
of
the
people
of
israel
then
the
god
of
humanity
and
finally
the
god
of
the
whole
universe
like
monarchy
monotheism
had
a
martial
origin
it
is
only
on
the
march
and
in
time
of
war
says
robertson
smith
in
prophets
of
that
a
nomad
people
feels
any
urgent
need
of
a
central
authority
and
so
it
came
about
that
in
the
first
beginnings
of
national
organization
centring
in
the
sanctuary
of
the
ark
israel
was
thought
of
mainly
as
the
host
of
jehovah
the
very
name
of
israel
is
martial
and
means
fighteth
and
jehovah
in
the
old
testament
is
iahwè
çebäôth
the
jehovah
of
the
armies
of
israel
it
was
on
the
battlefield
that
jehovah
presence
was
most
clearly
realized
but
in
primitive
nations
the
leader
in
time
of
war
is
also
the
natural
judge
in
time
of
peace
god
the
only
god
issued
therefore
from
man
sense
of
divinity
as
a
warlike
monarchical
and
social
god
he
revealed
himself
to
the
people
as
a
whole
not
to
the
individual
he
was
the
god
of
a
people
and
he
jealously
exacted
that
worship
should
be
rendered
to
him
alone
the
transition
from
this
monocultism
to
monotheism
was
effected
largely
by
the
individual
action
more
philosophical
perhaps
than
theological
of
the
prophets
it
was
in
fact
the
individual
activity
of
the
prophets
that
individualized
the
divinity
and
above
all
by
making
the
divinity
ethical
subsequently
reason
that
is
philosophy
took
possession
of
this
god
who
had
arisen
in
the
human
consciousness
as
a
consequence
of
the
sense
of
divinity
in
man
and
tended
to
define
him
and
convert
him
into
an
idea
for
to
define
a
thing
is
to
idealize
it
a
process
which
necessitates
the
abstraction
from
it
of
its
incommensurable
or
irrational
element
its
vital
essence
thus
the
god
of
feeling
the
divinity
felt
as
a
unique
person
and
consciousness
external
to
us
although
at
the
same
time
enveloping
and
sustaining
us
was
converted
into
the
idea
of
god
the
logical
rational
god
the
the
the
supreme
being
of
theological
philosophy
the
god
who
is
reached
by
the
three
famous
ways
of
negation
eminence
and
causality
negationis
eminentiæ
is
nothing
but
an
idea
of
god
a
dead
thing
the
traditional
and
much
debated
proofs
of
his
existence
are
at
bottom
merely
a
vain
attempt
to
determine
his
essence
for
as
vinet
has
very
well
observed
existence
is
deduced
from
essence
and
to
say
that
god
exists
without
saying
what
god
is
and
how
he
is
is
equivalent
to
saying
nothing
at
all
and
this
god
arrived
at
by
the
methods
of
eminence
and
negation
or
abstraction
of
finite
qualities
ends
by
becoming
an
unthinkable
god
a
pure
idea
a
god
of
whom
by
the
very
fact
of
his
ideal
excellence
we
can
say
that
he
is
nothing
as
indeed
he
has
been
defined
by
scotus
erigena
propter
excellentiam
non
inmerito
nihil
or
in
the
words
of
the
the
areopagite
in
his
fifth
epistle
the
divine
darkness
is
the
inaccessible
light
in
which
god
is
said
to
dwell
the
anthropomorphic
god
the
god
who
is
felt
in
being
purified
of
human
and
as
such
finite
relative
and
temporal
attributes
evaporates
into
the
god
of
deism
or
of
pantheism
the
traditional
proofs
of
the
existence
of
god
all
refer
to
this
to
this
logical
god
the
god
by
abstraction
and
hence
they
really
prove
nothing
or
rather
they
prove
nothing
more
than
the
existence
of
this
idea
of
god
in
my
early
youth
when
first
i
began
to
be
puzzled
by
these
eternal
problems
i
read
in
a
book
the
author
of
which
i
have
no
wish
to
recall
this
sentence
god
is
the
great
x
placed
over
the
ultimate
barrier
of
human
knowledge
in
the
measure
in
which
science
advances
the
barrier
recedes
and
i
wrote
in
the
margin
on
this
side
of
the
barrier
everything
is
explained
without
him
on
the
further
side
nothing
is
explained
either
with
him
or
without
him
god
therefore
is
superfluous
and
so
far
as
concerns
the
the
god
of
the
proofs
i
continue
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
laplace
is
said
to
have
stated
that
he
had
not
found
the
hypothesis
of
god
necessary
in
order
to
construct
his
scheme
of
the
origin
of
the
universe
and
it
is
very
true
in
no
way
whatever
does
the
idea
of
god
help
us
to
understand
better
the
existence
the
essence
and
the
finality
of
the
universe
that
there
is
a
supreme
being
infinite
absolute
and
eternal
whose
existence
is
unknown
to
us
and
who
has
created
the
universe
is
not
more
conceivable
than
that
the
material
basis
of
the
universe
itself
its
matter
is
eternal
and
infinite
and
absolute
we
do
not
understand
the
existence
of
the
world
one
whit
the
better
by
telling
ourselves
that
god
created
it
it
is
a
begging
of
the
question
or
a
merely
verbal
solution
intended
to
cover
up
our
ignorance
in
strict
truth
we
deduce
the
existence
of
the
creator
from
the
fact
that
the
thing
created
exists
a
process
which
does
not
justify
rationally
his
existence
you
can
not
deduce
a
necessity
from
a
fact
or
else
everything
were
necessary
and
if
from
the
nature
of
the
universe
we
pass
to
what
is
called
its
order
which
is
supposed
to
necessitate
an
ordainer
we
may
say
that
order
is
what
there
is
and
we
do
not
conceive
of
any
other
this
deduction
of
god
existence
from
the
order
of
the
universe
implies
a
transition
from
the
ideal
to
the
real
order
an
outward
projection
of
our
mind
a
supposition
that
the
rational
explanation
of
a
thing
produces
the
thing
itself
human
art
instructed
by
nature
possesses
a
conscious
creative
faculty
by
means
of
which
it
apprehends
the
process
of
creation
and
we
proceed
to
transfer
this
conscious
and
artistic
creative
faculty
to
the
consciousness
of
an
but
from
what
nature
he
in
his
turn
learnt
his
art
we
can
not
tell
the
traditional
analogy
of
the
watch
and
the
watchmaker
is
inapplicable
to
a
being
absolute
infinite
and
eternal
it
is
moreover
only
another
way
of
explaining
nothing
for
to
say
that
the
world
is
as
it
is
and
not
otherwise
because
god
made
it
so
while
at
the
same
time
we
do
not
know
for
what
reason
he
made
it
so
is
to
say
nothing
and
if
we
knew
for
what
reason
god
made
it
so
then
god
is
superfluous
and
the
reason
itself
suffices
if
everything
were
mathematics
if
there
were
no
irrational
element
we
should
not
have
had
recourse
to
this
explanatory
theory
of
a
supreme
ordainer
who
is
nothing
but
the
reason
of
the
irrational
and
so
merely
another
cloak
for
our
ignorance
and
let
us
not
discuss
here
that
absurd
proposition
that
if
all
the
type
in
a
were
printed
at
random
the
result
could
not
possibly
be
the
composition
of
something
would
be
composed
which
would
be
as
good
as
for
those
who
would
have
to
be
content
with
it
and
would
grow
in
it
and
would
form
part
of
it
in
effect
this
traditional
supposed
proof
of
god
existence
resolves
itself
fundamentally
into
hypostatizing
or
substantivating
the
explanation
or
reason
of
a
phenomenon
it
amounts
to
saying
that
mechanics
is
the
cause
of
movement
biology
of
life
philology
of
language
chemistry
of
bodies
by
simply
adding
the
capital
letter
to
the
science
and
converting
it
into
a
force
distinct
from
the
phenomena
from
which
we
derive
it
and
distinct
from
our
mind
which
effects
the
derivation
but
the
god
who
is
the
result
of
this
process
a
god
who
is
nothing
but
reason
hypostatized
and
projected
towards
the
infinite
can
not
possibly
be
felt
as
something
living
and
real
nor
yet
be
conceived
of
save
as
a
mere
idea
which
will
die
with
us
the
question
arises
on
the
other
hand
whether
a
thing
the
idea
of
which
has
been
conceived
but
which
has
no
real
existence
does
not
exist
because
god
wills
that
it
should
not
exist
or
whether
god
does
not
will
it
to
exist
because
in
fact
it
does
not
exist
and
with
regard
to
the
impossible
whether
a
thing
is
impossible
because
god
wills
it
so
or
whether
god
wills
it
so
because
in
itself
and
by
the
very
fact
of
its
own
inherent
absurdity
it
is
impossible
god
has
to
submit
to
the
logical
law
of
contradiction
and
he
can
not
according
to
the
theologians
cause
two
and
two
to
make
either
more
or
less
than
four
either
the
law
of
necessity
is
above
him
or
he
himself
is
the
law
of
necessity
and
in
the
moral
order
the
question
arises
whether
falsehood
or
homicide
or
adultery
are
wrong
because
he
has
so
decreed
it
or
whether
he
has
so
decreed
it
because
they
are
wrong
if
the
former
then
god
is
a
capricious
and
unreasonable
god
who
decrees
one
law
when
he
might
equally
well
have
decreed
another
or
if
the
latter
he
obeys
an
intrinsic
nature
and
essence
which
exists
in
things
themselves
independently
of
him
that
is
to
say
independently
of
his
sovereign
will
and
if
this
is
the
case
if
he
obeys
the
innate
reason
of
things
this
reason
if
we
could
but
know
it
would
suffice
us
without
any
further
need
of
god
and
since
we
do
not
know
it
god
explains
nothing
this
reason
would
be
above
god
neither
is
it
of
any
avail
to
say
that
this
reason
is
god
himself
the
supreme
reason
of
things
a
reason
of
this
kind
a
necessary
reason
is
not
a
personal
something
it
is
will
that
gives
personality
and
it
is
because
of
this
problem
of
the
relations
between
god
reason
necessarily
necessary
and
his
will
necessarily
free
that
the
logical
and
aristotelian
god
will
always
be
a
contradictory
god
the
scholastic
theologians
never
succeeded
in
disentangling
themselves
from
the
difficulties
in
which
they
found
themselves
involved
when
they
attempted
to
reconcile
human
liberty
with
divine
prescience
and
with
the
knowledge
that
god
possesses
of
the
free
and
contingent
future
and
that
is
strictly
the
reason
why
the
rational
god
is
wholly
inapplicable
to
the
contingent
for
the
notion
of
contingency
is
fundamentally
the
same
as
the
notion
of
irrationality
the
rational
god
is
necessarily
necessary
in
his
being
and
in
his
working
in
every
single
case
he
can
not
do
other
than
the
best
and
a
number
of
different
things
can
not
all
equally
be
the
best
for
among
infinite
possibilities
there
is
only
one
that
is
best
accommodated
to
its
end
just
as
among
the
infinite
number
of
lines
that
can
be
drawn
from
one
point
to
another
there
is
only
one
straight
line
and
the
rational
god
the
god
of
reason
can
not
but
follow
in
each
case
the
straight
line
the
line
that
leads
most
directly
to
the
end
proposed
a
necessary
end
just
as
the
only
straight
line
that
leads
to
it
is
a
necessary
line
and
thus
for
the
divinity
of
god
is
substituted
his
necessity
and
in
the
necessity
of
god
his
free
will
that
is
to
say
his
conscious
personality
perishes
the
god
of
our
heart
desire
the
god
who
shall
save
our
soul
from
nothingness
must
needs
be
an
arbitrary
god
not
because
he
thinks
can
god
be
god
but
because
he
works
because
he
creates
he
is
not
a
contemplative
but
an
active
god
a
a
theoretical
or
contemplative
god
such
as
is
this
god
of
theological
rationalism
is
a
god
that
is
diluted
in
his
own
contemplation
with
this
god
corresponds
as
we
shall
see
the
beatific
vision
understood
as
the
supreme
expression
of
human
felicity
a
quietist
god
in
short
as
reason
by
its
very
essence
is
quietist
there
remains
the
other
famous
proof
of
god
existence
that
of
the
supposed
unanimous
consent
in
a
belief
in
him
among
all
peoples
but
this
proof
is
not
strictly
rational
neither
is
it
an
argument
in
favour
of
the
rational
god
who
explains
the
universe
but
of
the
god
of
the
heart
who
makes
us
live
we
should
be
justified
in
calling
it
a
rational
proof
only
on
the
supposition
that
we
believed
that
reason
was
identical
with
a
more
or
less
unanimous
agreement
among
all
peoples
that
it
corresponded
with
the
verdict
of
a
universal
suffrage
only
on
the
supposition
that
we
held
that
which
is
said
to
be
was
actually
the
voice
of
reason
such
was
indeed
the
belief
of
lamennais
that
tragic
and
ardent
spirit
who
affirmed
that
life
and
truth
were
essentially
one
and
the
same
thing
would
that
they
were
and
that
reason
was
one
universal
everlasting
and
holy
sur
partie
chap
he
invoked
the
omnibus
credendum
est
aut
of
lactantius
we
must
believe
all
or
none
and
the
saying
of
heraclitus
that
every
individual
opinion
is
fallible
and
that
of
aristotle
that
the
strongest
proof
consists
in
the
general
agreement
of
mankind
and
above
all
that
of
pliny
lxii
to
the
effect
that
one
man
can
not
deceive
all
men
or
be
deceived
by
all
omnes
neminem
omnes
would
that
it
were
so
and
so
he
concludes
with
the
dictum
of
cicero
natura
lib
cap
and
that
we
must
believe
the
tradition
of
our
ancestors
even
though
they
fail
to
render
us
a
reason
autem
nostris
etiam
nulla
ratione
reddita
let
us
suppose
that
this
belief
of
the
ancients
in
the
divine
interpenetration
of
the
whole
of
nature
is
universal
and
constant
and
that
it
is
as
aristotle
calls
it
an
ancestral
dogma
lib
cap
vii
this
would
prove
only
that
there
is
a
motive
impelling
peoples
and
individuals
that
is
to
say
all
or
almost
all
or
a
majority
of
them
to
believe
in
a
god
but
may
it
not
be
that
there
are
illusions
and
fallacies
rooted
in
human
nature
itself
do
not
all
peoples
begin
by
believing
that
the
sun
turns
round
the
earth
and
do
we
not
all
naturally
incline
to
believe
that
which
satisfies
our
desires
shall
we
say
with
hermann
that
if
there
is
a
god
he
has
not
left
us
without
some
indication
of
himself
and
if
is
his
will
that
we
should
find
him
a
pious
desire
no
doubt
but
we
can
not
strictly
call
it
a
reason
unless
we
apply
to
it
the
augustinian
sentence
but
which
again
is
not
a
reason
since
thou
seekest
me
it
must
be
that
thou
hast
found
me
believing
that
god
is
the
cause
of
our
seeking
him
this
famous
argument
from
the
supposed
unanimity
of
mankind
belief
in
god
the
argument
which
with
a
sure
instinct
was
seized
upon
by
the
ancients
is
in
its
essence
identical
with
the
moral
proof
which
kant
employed
in
his
of
practical
transposing
its
application
from
mankind
collectively
to
the
individual
the
proof
which
he
derives
from
our
conscience
or
rather
from
our
feeling
of
divinity
it
is
not
a
proof
strictly
or
specifically
rational
but
vital
it
can
not
be
applied
to
the
logical
god
the
the
essentially
simple
and
abstract
being
the
immobile
and
impassible
prime
mover
the
in
a
word
but
to
the
biotic
god
to
the
being
essentially
complex
and
concrete
to
the
suffering
god
who
suffers
and
desires
in
us
and
with
us
to
the
father
of
christ
who
is
only
to
be
approached
through
man
through
his
son
john
xiv
and
whose
revelation
is
historical
or
if
you
like
anecdotical
but
not
philosophical
or
categorical
the
unanimous
consent
of
mankind
let
us
suppose
the
unanimity
or
in
other
words
this
universal
longing
of
all
human
souls
who
have
arrived
at
the
consciousness
of
their
humanity
which
desires
to
be
the
end
and
meaning
of
the
universe
this
longing
which
is
nothing
but
that
very
essence
of
the
soul
which
consists
in
its
effort
to
persist
eternally
and
without
a
break
in
the
continuity
of
consciousness
leads
us
to
the
human
anthropomorphic
god
the
projection
of
our
consciousness
to
the
consciousness
of
the
universe
it
leads
us
to
the
god
who
confers
human
meaning
and
finality
upon
the
universe
and
who
is
not
the
the
nor
the
creator
of
the
universe
nor
merely
the
it
leads
us
to
the
living
subjective
god
for
he
is
simply
subjectivity
objectified
or
personality
universalized
he
is
more
than
a
mere
idea
and
he
is
will
rather
than
reason
god
is
love
that
is
will
reason
the
word
derives
from
him
but
he
the
father
is
above
all
will
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
ritschl
says
und
chap
that
a
very
imperfect
view
was
taken
of
god
spiritual
personality
in
the
older
theology
when
the
functions
of
knowing
and
willing
alone
were
employed
to
illustrate
it
religious
thought
plainly
ascribes
to
god
affections
of
feeling
as
well
the
older
theology
however
laboured
under
the
impression
that
feeling
and
emotion
were
characteristic
only
of
limited
and
created
personality
it
transformed
the
religious
idea
of
the
divine
blessedness
into
eternal
and
that
of
the
divine
wrath
into
a
fixed
purpose
to
punish
sin
yes
this
logical
god
arrived
at
by
the
was
a
god
who
strictly
speaking
neither
loved
nor
hated
because
he
neither
enjoyed
nor
suffered
an
inhuman
god
and
his
justice
was
a
rational
or
mathematical
justice
that
is
an
injustice
the
attributes
of
the
living
god
of
the
father
of
christ
must
be
deduced
from
his
historical
revelation
in
the
gospel
and
in
the
conscience
of
every
christian
believer
and
not
from
metaphysical
reasonings
which
lead
only
to
the
of
scotus
erigena
to
the
rational
or
pantheistic
god
to
the
atheist
god
in
short
to
the
divinity
not
by
the
way
of
reason
but
only
by
the
way
of
love
and
of
suffering
do
we
come
to
the
living
god
the
human
god
reason
rather
separates
us
from
him
we
can
not
first
know
him
in
order
that
afterwards
we
may
love
him
we
must
begin
by
loving
him
longing
for
him
hungering
after
him
before
knowing
him
the
knowledge
of
god
proceeds
from
the
love
of
god
and
this
knowledge
has
little
or
nothing
of
the
rational
in
it
for
god
is
indefinable
to
seek
to
define
him
is
to
seek
to
confine
him
within
the
limits
of
our
mind
that
is
to
say
to
kill
him
in
so
far
as
we
attempt
to
define
him
there
rises
up
before
us
nothingness
the
idea
of
god
formulated
by
a
theodicy
that
claims
to
be
rational
is
simply
an
hypothesis
like
the
hypotheses
of
ether
for
example
ether
is
in
effect
a
merely
hypothetical
entity
valuable
only
in
so
far
as
it
explains
that
which
by
means
of
it
we
endeavour
to
explain
light
electricity
or
universal
gravitation
and
only
in
so
far
as
these
facts
can
not
be
explained
in
any
other
way
in
like
manner
the
idea
of
god
is
also
an
hypothesis
valuable
only
in
so
far
as
it
enables
us
to
explain
that
which
by
means
of
if
we
endeavour
to
explain
the
essence
and
existence
of
the
universe
and
only
so
long
as
these
can
not
be
explained
in
any
other
way
and
since
in
reality
we
explain
the
universe
neither
better
nor
worse
with
this
idea
than
without
it
the
idea
of
god
the
supreme
is
valueless
but
if
ether
is
nothing
but
an
hypothesis
explanatory
of
light
air
on
the
other
hand
is
a
thing
that
is
directly
felt
and
even
though
it
did
not
enable
us
to
explain
the
phenomenon
of
sound
we
should
nevertheless
always
be
directly
aware
of
it
and
above
all
of
the
lack
of
it
in
moments
of
suffocation
or
and
in
the
same
way
god
himself
not
the
idea
of
god
may
become
a
reality
that
is
immediately
felt
and
even
though
the
idea
of
him
does
not
enable
us
to
explain
either
the
existence
or
the
essence
of
the
universe
we
have
at
times
the
direct
feeling
of
god
above
all
in
moments
of
spiritual
suffocation
and
this
feeling
mark
it
well
for
all
that
is
tragic
in
it
and
the
whole
tragic
sense
of
life
is
founded
upon
this
this
feeling
is
a
feeling
of
hunger
for
god
of
the
lack
of
god
to
believe
in
god
is
in
the
first
instance
as
we
shall
see
to
wish
that
there
may
be
a
god
to
be
unable
to
live
without
him
so
long
as
i
pilgrimaged
through
the
fields
of
reason
in
search
of
god
i
could
not
find
him
for
i
was
not
deluded
by
the
idea
of
god
neither
could
i
take
an
idea
for
god
and
it
was
then
as
i
wandered
among
the
wastes
of
rationalism
that
i
told
myself
that
we
ought
to
seek
no
other
consolation
than
the
truth
meaning
thereby
reason
and
yet
for
all
that
i
was
not
comforted
but
as
i
sank
deeper
and
deeper
into
rational
scepticism
on
the
one
hand
and
into
heart
despair
on
the
other
the
hunger
for
god
awoke
within
me
and
the
suffocation
of
spirit
made
me
feel
the
want
of
god
and
with
the
want
of
him
his
reality
and
i
wished
that
there
might
be
a
god
that
god
might
exist
and
god
does
not
exist
but
rather
and
he
is
sustaining
our
existence
existing
us
existiéndonos
god
who
is
love
the
father
of
love
is
the
son
of
love
in
us
there
are
men
of
a
facile
and
external
habit
of
mind
slaves
of
reason
that
reason
which
externalizes
us
who
think
it
a
shrewd
comment
to
say
that
so
far
from
god
having
made
man
in
his
image
and
likeness
it
is
rather
man
who
has
made
his
gods
or
his
god
in
his
own
image
and
likeness
and
so
superficial
are
they
that
they
do
not
pause
to
consider
that
if
the
second
of
these
propositions
be
true
as
in
fact
it
is
it
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
first
is
not
less
true
god
and
man
in
effect
mutually
create
one
another
god
creates
or
reveals
himself
in
man
and
man
creates
himself
in
god
god
is
his
own
maker
ipse
se
said
lactantius
and
we
may
say
that
he
is
making
himself
continually
both
in
man
and
by
man
and
if
each
of
us
impelled
by
his
love
by
his
hunger
for
divinity
creates
for
himself
an
image
of
god
according
to
his
own
desire
and
if
according
to
his
desire
god
creates
himself
for
each
of
us
then
there
is
a
collective
social
human
god
the
resultant
of
all
the
human
imaginations
that
imagine
him
for
god
is
and
reveals
himself
in
collectivity
and
god
is
the
richest
and
most
personal
of
human
conceptions
the
master
of
divinity
has
bidden
us
be
perfect
as
our
father
who
is
in
heaven
is
perfect
matt
and
in
the
sphere
of
thought
and
feeling
our
perfection
consists
in
the
zeal
with
which
we
endeavour
to
equate
our
imagination
with
the
total
imagination
of
the
humanity
of
which
in
god
we
form
a
part
the
logical
theory
of
the
opposition
between
the
extension
and
the
comprehension
of
a
concept
the
one
increasing
in
the
ratio
in
which
the
other
diminishes
is
well
known
the
concept
that
is
most
extensive
and
at
the
same
time
least
comprehensive
is
that
of
being
or
of
thing
which
embraces
everything
that
exists
and
possesses
no
other
distinguishing
quality
than
that
of
being
while
the
concept
that
is
most
comprehensive
and
least
extensive
is
that
of
the
universe
which
is
only
applicable
to
itself
and
comprehends
all
existing
qualities
and
the
logical
or
rational
god
the
god
obtained
by
way
of
negation
the
absolute
entity
merges
like
reality
itself
into
nothingness
for
as
hegel
pointed
out
pure
being
and
pure
nothingness
are
identical
and
the
god
of
the
heart
the
god
who
is
felt
the
god
of
living
men
is
the
universe
itself
conceived
as
personality
is
the
consciousness
of
the
universe
a
god
universal
and
personal
altogether
different
from
the
individual
god
of
a
rigid
metaphysical
monotheism
i
must
advert
here
once
again
to
my
view
of
the
opposition
that
exists
between
individuality
and
personality
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
one
demands
the
other
individuality
is
if
i
may
so
express
it
the
continent
or
thing
which
contains
personality
the
content
or
thing
contained
or
i
might
say
that
my
personality
is
in
a
certain
sense
my
comprehension
that
which
i
comprehend
or
embrace
within
myself
which
is
in
a
certain
way
the
whole
universe
and
that
my
individuality
is
my
extension
the
one
my
infinite
the
other
my
finite
a
hundred
jars
of
hard
earthenware
are
strongly
individualized
but
it
is
possible
for
them
to
be
all
equally
empty
or
all
equally
full
of
the
same
homogeneous
liquid
whereas
two
bladders
of
so
delicate
a
membrane
as
to
admit
of
the
action
of
osmosis
and
exosmosis
may
be
strongly
differentiated
and
contain
liquids
of
a
very
mixed
composition
and
thus
a
man
in
so
far
as
he
is
an
individual
may
be
very
sharply
detached
from
others
a
sort
of
spiritual
crustacean
and
yet
be
very
poor
in
differentiating
content
and
further
it
is
true
on
the
other
hand
that
the
more
personality
a
man
has
and
the
greater
his
interior
richness
and
the
more
he
is
a
society
within
himself
the
less
brusquely
he
is
divided
from
his
fellows
in
the
same
way
the
rigid
god
of
deism
of
aristotelian
monotheism
the
is
a
being
in
whom
individuality
or
rather
simplicity
stifles
personality
definition
kills
him
for
to
define
is
to
impose
boundaries
it
is
to
limit
and
it
is
impossible
to
define
the
absolutely
indefinable
this
god
lacks
interior
richness
he
is
not
a
society
in
himself
and
this
the
vital
revelation
obviated
by
the
belief
in
the
trinity
which
makes
god
a
society
and
even
a
family
in
himself
and
no
longer
a
pure
individual
the
god
of
faith
is
personal
he
is
a
person
because
he
includes
three
persons
for
personality
is
not
sensible
of
itself
in
isolation
an
isolated
person
ceases
to
be
a
person
for
whom
should
he
love
and
if
he
does
not
love
he
is
not
a
person
nor
can
a
simple
being
love
himself
without
his
love
expanding
him
into
a
compound
being
it
was
because
god
was
felt
as
a
father
that
the
belief
in
the
trinity
arose
for
a
can
not
be
a
single
that
is
a
solitary
god
a
father
is
always
the
father
of
a
family
and
the
fact
that
god
was
felt
as
a
father
acted
as
a
continual
incentive
to
conceive
him
not
merely
anthropomorphically
that
is
to
say
as
a
man
but
andromorphically
as
a
male
in
the
popular
christian
imagination
in
effect
god
the
father
is
conceived
of
as
a
male
and
the
reason
is
that
man
as
we
know
him
is
necessarily
either
a
male
or
a
female
and
to
these
may
be
added
the
child
who
is
neuter
and
hence
in
order
to
satisfy
imaginatively
this
necessity
of
feeling
god
as
a
perfect
man
that
is
as
a
family
arose
the
cult
of
the
the
virgin
mary
and
the
cult
of
the
child
jesus
the
cult
of
the
virgin
mariolatry
which
by
the
gradual
elevation
of
the
divine
element
in
the
virgin
has
led
almost
to
her
deification
answers
merely
to
the
demand
of
the
feeling
that
god
should
be
a
perfect
man
that
god
should
include
in
his
nature
the
feminine
element
the
progressive
exaltation
of
the
virgin
mary
the
work
of
catholic
piety
having
its
beginning
in
the
expression
mother
of
god
has
culminated
in
attributing
to
her
the
status
of
and
in
the
dogmatic
declaration
of
her
conception
without
the
stain
of
original
sin
hence
she
now
occupies
a
position
between
humanity
and
divinity
and
nearer
divinity
than
humanity
and
it
has
been
surmised
that
in
course
of
time
she
may
perhaps
even
come
to
be
regarded
as
yet
another
personal
manifestation
of
the
godhead
and
yet
this
might
not
necessarily
involve
the
conversion
of
the
trinity
into
a
quaternity
if
in
greek
spirit
instead
of
being
neuter
had
been
feminine
who
can
say
that
the
virgin
mary
might
not
already
have
become
an
incarnation
or
humanization
of
the
holy
spirit
that
fervent
piety
which
always
knows
how
to
mould
theological
speculation
in
accordance
with
its
own
desires
would
have
found
sufficient
warranty
for
such
a
doctrine
in
the
text
of
the
gospel
in
luke
narrative
of
the
annunciation
where
the
angel
gabriel
hails
mary
with
the
words
the
holy
spirit
shall
come
upon
thee
agion
epeleusetai
epi
luke
i
and
thus
a
dogmatic
evolution
would
have
been
effected
parallel
to
that
of
the
divinization
of
jesus
the
son
and
his
identification
with
the
word
in
any
case
the
cult
of
the
virgin
of
the
eternal
feminine
or
rather
of
the
divine
feminine
of
the
divine
maternity
helps
to
complete
the
personalization
of
god
by
constituting
him
a
family
in
one
of
my
books
de
don
quijote
y
part
chap
lxvii
i
have
said
that
god
was
and
is
in
our
mind
masculine
in
his
mode
of
judging
and
condemning
men
he
acts
as
a
male
not
as
a
human
person
above
the
limitation
of
sex
he
acts
as
a
father
and
to
counterbalance
this
the
mother
element
was
required
the
mother
who
always
forgives
the
mother
whose
arms
are
always
open
to
the
child
when
he
flies
from
the
frowning
brow
or
uplifted
hand
of
the
angry
father
the
mother
in
whose
bosom
we
seek
the
dim
comforting
memory
of
that
warmth
and
peace
of
our
unconsciousness
of
that
milky
sweetness
that
soothed
our
dreams
of
innocence
the
mother
who
knows
no
justice
but
that
of
forgiveness
no
law
but
that
of
love
our
weak
and
imperfect
conception
of
god
as
a
god
with
a
long
beard
and
a
voice
of
thunder
of
a
god
who
promulgates
laws
and
pronounces
dooms
of
a
god
who
is
the
master
of
a
household
a
roman
paterfamilias
required
counterpoise
and
complement
and
since
fundamentally
we
are
unable
to
conceive
of
the
personal
and
living
god
as
exalted
above
human
and
even
masculine
characteristics
and
still
less
as
a
neutral
or
hermaphrodite
god
we
have
recourse
to
providing
him
with
a
feminine
god
and
by
the
side
of
the
we
have
placed
the
she
who
always
forgives
because
since
she
sees
with
eyes
she
sees
always
the
hidden
cause
of
the
fault
and
in
that
hidden
cause
the
only
justice
of
forgiveness
and
to
this
i
must
now
add
that
not
only
are
we
unable
to
conceive
of
the
full
and
living
god
as
masculine
simply
but
we
are
unable
to
conceive
of
him
as
individual
simply
as
the
projection
of
a
solitary
i
an
unsocial
i
an
i
that
is
in
reality
an
abstract
i
my
living
i
is
an
i
that
is
really
a
we
my
living
personal
i
lives
only
in
other
of
other
and
by
other
i
i
am
sprung
from
a
multitude
of
ancestors
i
carry
them
within
me
in
extract
and
at
the
same
time
i
carry
within
me
potentially
a
multitude
of
descendants
and
god
the
projection
of
my
i
to
the
infinite
or
rather
i
the
projection
of
god
to
the
finite
must
also
be
multitude
hence
in
order
to
save
the
personality
of
god
that
is
to
say
in
order
to
save
the
living
god
faith
need
the
need
of
the
feeling
and
the
imagination
of
conceiving
him
and
feeling
him
as
possessed
of
a
certain
internal
multiplicity
this
need
the
pagan
feeling
of
a
living
divinity
obviated
by
polytheism
it
is
the
agglomeration
of
its
gods
the
republic
of
them
that
really
constitutes
its
divinity
the
real
god
of
hellenic
paganism
is
not
so
much
father
zeus
as
the
whole
society
of
gods
and
hence
the
solemnity
of
the
invocation
of
demosthenes
when
he
invoked
all
the
gods
and
all
the
goddesses
theohis
euchomai
pasi
kahi
and
when
the
rationalizers
converted
the
term
god
which
is
properly
an
adjective
a
quality
predicated
of
each
one
of
the
gods
into
a
substantive
and
added
the
definite
article
to
it
they
produced
god
the
dead
and
abstract
god
of
philosophical
rationalism
a
substantivized
quality
and
therefore
void
of
personality
for
the
masculine
concrete
god
dios
is
nothing
but
the
neuter
abstract
divine
quality
divino
now
the
transition
from
feeling
the
divinity
in
all
things
to
substantivating
it
and
converting
the
divinity
into
god
can
not
be
achieved
without
feeling
undergoing
a
certain
risk
and
the
aristotelian
god
the
god
of
the
logical
proofs
is
nothing
more
than
the
divinity
a
concept
and
not
a
living
person
who
can
be
felt
and
with
whom
through
love
man
can
communicate
this
god
is
merely
a
substantivized
adjective
he
is
a
constitutional
god
who
reigns
but
does
not
govern
and
knowledge
is
his
constitutional
charter
and
even
in
paganism
itself
the
tendency
towards
a
living
monotheism
is
apparent
in
the
fact
that
zeus
was
conceived
of
and
felt
as
a
father
as
homer
calls
him
the
or
of
the
latins
and
as
a
father
of
a
whole
widely
extended
family
of
gods
and
goddesses
who
together
with
him
constituted
the
divinity
the
conjunction
of
pagan
polytheism
with
judaic
monotheism
which
had
endeavoured
by
other
means
to
save
the
personality
of
god
gave
birth
to
the
feeling
of
the
catholic
god
a
god
who
is
a
society
as
the
pagan
god
of
whom
i
have
spoken
was
a
society
and
who
at
the
same
time
is
one
as
the
god
of
israel
finally
became
one
such
is
the
christian
trinity
whose
deepest
sense
rationalistic
deism
has
scarcely
ever
succeeded
in
understanding
that
deism
which
though
more
or
less
impregnated
with
christianity
always
remains
unitarian
or
socinian
and
the
truth
is
that
we
feel
god
less
as
a
superhuman
consciousness
than
as
the
actual
consciousness
of
the
whole
human
race
past
present
and
future
as
the
collective
consciousness
of
the
whole
race
and
still
more
as
the
total
and
infinite
consciousness
which
embraces
and
sustains
all
consciousnesses
human
and
perhaps
the
divinity
that
there
is
in
everything
from
the
lowest
that
is
to
say
from
the
least
conscious
of
living
forms
to
the
highest
including
our
own
human
consciousness
this
divinity
we
feel
to
be
personalized
conscious
of
itself
in
god
and
this
gradation
of
consciousnesses
this
sense
of
the
gulf
between
the
human
and
the
fully
divine
the
universal
consciousness
finds
its
counterpart
in
the
belief
in
angels
with
their
different
hierarchies
as
intermediaries
between
our
human
consciousness
and
that
of
god
and
these
gradations
a
faith
consistent
with
itself
must
believe
to
be
infinite
for
only
by
an
infinite
number
of
degrees
is
it
possible
to
pass
from
the
finite
to
the
infinite
deistic
rationalism
conceives
god
as
the
reason
of
the
universe
but
its
logic
compels
it
to
conceive
him
as
an
impersonal
reason
that
is
to
say
as
an
idea
while
deistic
vitalism
feels
and
imagines
god
as
consciousness
and
therefore
as
a
person
or
rather
as
a
society
of
persons
the
consciousness
of
each
one
of
us
in
effect
is
a
society
of
persons
in
me
there
are
various
i
and
even
the
i
of
those
among
whom
i
live
live
in
me
the
god
of
deistic
rationalism
in
effect
the
god
of
the
logical
proofs
of
his
existence
the
and
the
immobile
prime
mover
is
nothing
more
than
a
supreme
reason
but
in
the
same
sense
in
which
we
can
call
the
law
of
universal
gravitation
the
reason
of
the
falling
of
bodies
this
law
being
merely
the
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
but
will
anyone
say
that
that
which
we
call
the
law
of
universal
gravitation
or
any
other
law
or
mathematical
principle
is
a
true
and
independent
reality
that
it
is
an
angel
that
it
is
something
which
possesses
consciousness
of
itself
and
others
that
it
is
a
person
no
it
is
nothing
but
an
idea
without
any
reality
outside
of
the
mind
of
him
who
conceives
it
and
similarly
this
either
possesses
consciousness
of
himself
or
he
possesses
no
reality
outside
the
mind
that
conceives
him
and
if
he
possesses
consciousness
of
himself
he
becomes
a
personal
reason
and
then
all
the
value
of
the
traditional
proofs
disappears
for
these
proofs
only
proved
a
reason
but
not
a
supreme
consciousness
mathematics
prove
an
order
a
constancy
a
reason
in
the
series
of
mechanical
phenomena
but
they
not
prove
that
this
reason
is
conscious
of
itself
this
reason
is
a
logical
necessity
but
the
logical
necessity
does
not
prove
the
teleological
or
finalist
necessity
and
where
there
is
no
finality
there
is
no
personality
there
is
no
consciousness
the
rational
god
therefore
that
is
to
say
the
god
who
is
simply
the
reason
of
the
universe
and
nothing
more
consummates
his
own
destruction
is
destroyed
in
our
mind
in
so
far
as
he
is
such
a
god
and
is
only
born
again
in
us
when
we
feel
him
in
our
heart
as
a
living
person
as
consciousness
and
no
longer
merely
as
the
impersonal
and
objective
reason
of
the
universe
if
we
wish
for
a
rational
explanation
of
the
construction
of
a
machine
all
that
we
require
to
know
is
the
mechanical
science
of
its
constructor
but
if
we
would
have
a
reason
for
the
existence
of
such
a
machine
then
since
it
is
the
work
not
of
nature
but
of
man
we
must
suppose
a
conscious
constructive
being
but
the
second
part
of
this
reasoning
is
not
applicable
to
god
even
though
it
be
said
that
in
him
the
mechanical
science
and
the
mechanician
by
means
of
which
the
machine
was
constructed
are
one
and
the
same
thing
from
the
rational
point
of
view
this
identification
is
merely
a
begging
of
the
question
and
thus
it
is
that
reason
destroys
this
supreme
reason
in
so
far
as
the
latter
is
a
person
the
human
reason
in
effect
is
a
reason
that
is
based
upon
the
irrational
upon
the
total
vital
consciousness
upon
will
and
feeling
our
human
reason
is
not
a
reason
that
can
prove
to
us
the
existence
of
a
supreme
reason
which
in
its
turn
would
have
to
be
based
upon
the
supreme
irrational
upon
the
universal
consciousness
and
the
revelation
of
this
supreme
consciousness
in
our
feeling
and
imagination
by
love
by
faith
by
the
process
of
personalization
is
that
which
leads
us
to
believe
in
the
living
god
and
this
god
the
living
god
your
god
our
god
is
in
me
is
in
you
lives
in
us
and
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
in
him
and
he
is
in
us
by
virtue
of
the
hunger
the
longing
which
we
have
for
him
he
is
himself
creating
the
longing
for
himself
and
he
is
the
god
of
the
humble
for
in
the
words
of
the
apostle
god
chose
the
foolish
things
of
the
world
to
confound
the
wise
and
the
weak
things
of
the
world
to
confound
the
things
which
are
mighty
i
cor
i
and
god
is
in
each
one
of
us
in
the
measure
in
which
each
one
feels
him
and
loves
him
if
of
two
men
says
kierkegaard
one
prays
to
the
true
god
without
sincerity
of
heart
and
the
other
prays
to
an
idol
with
all
the
passion
of
an
infinite
yearning
it
is
the
first
who
really
prays
to
an
idol
while
the
second
really
prays
to
god
it
would
be
better
to
say
that
the
true
god
is
he
to
whom
man
truly
prays
and
whom
man
truly
desires
and
there
may
even
be
a
truer
revelation
in
superstition
itself
than
in
theology
the
venerable
father
of
the
long
beard
and

locks
who
appears
among
the
clouds
carrying
the
globe
of
the
world
in
his
hand
is
more
living
and
more
real
than
the
of
theodicy
reason
is
an
analytical
that
is
a
dissolving
force
whenever
it
transfers
its
activity
from
the
form
of
intuitions
whether
those
of
the
individual
instinct
of
preservation
or
those
of
the
social
instinct
of
perpetuation
and
applies
it
to
the
essence
and
matter
of
them
reason
orders
the
sensible
perceptions
which
give
us
the
material
world
but
when
its
analysis
is
exercised
upon
the
reality
of
the
perceptions
themselves
it
dissolves
them
and
plunges
us
into
a
world
of
appearances
a
world
of
shadows
without
consistency
for
outside
the
domain
of
the
formal
reason
is
nihilist
and
annihilating
and
it
performs
the
same
terrible
office
when
we
withdraw
it
from
its
proper
domain
and
apply
it
to
the
scrutiny
of
the
imaginative
intuitions
which
give
us
the
spiritual
world
for
reason
annihilates
and
imagination
completes
integrates
or
totalizes
reason
by
itself
alone
kills
and
it
is
imagination
that
gives
life
if
it
is
true
that
imagination
by
itself
alone
in
giving
us
life
without
limit
leads
us
to
lose
our
identity
in
the
all
and
also
kills
us
as
individuals
it
kills
us
by
excess
of
life
reason
the
head
speaks
to
us
the
word
nothing
imagination
the
heart
the
word
all
and
between
all
and
nothing
by
the
fusion
of
the
all
and
the
nothing
within
us
we
live
in
god
who
is
all
and
god
lives
in
us
who
without
him
are
nothing
reason
reiterates
vanity
of
vanities
all
is
vanity
and
imagination
answers
plenitude
of
plenitudes
all
is
plenitude
and
thus
we
live
the
vanity
of
plenitude
or
the
plenitude
of
vanity
and
so
deeply
rooted
in
the
depths
of
man
being
is
this
vital
need
of
living
a
world
illogical
irrational
personal
or
divine
that
those
who
do
not
believe
in
god
or
believe
that
they
do
not
believe
in
him
believe
nevertheless
in
some
little
pocket
god
or
even
devil
of
their
own
or
in
an
omen
or
in
a
horseshoe
picked
up
by
chance
on
the
roadside
and
carried
about
with
them
to
bring
them
good
luck
and
defend
them
from
that
very
reason
whose
loyal
and
devoted
henchmen
they
imagine
themselves
to
be
the
god
whom
we
hunger
after
is
the
god
to
whom
we
pray
the
god
of
the
of
the
lord
prayer
the
god
whom
we
beseech
before
all
and
above
all
and
whether
we
are
aware
of
it
or
not
to
instil
faith
into
us
to
make
us
believe
in
him
to
make
himself
in
us
the
god
to
whom
we
pray
that
his
name
may
be
hallowed
and
that
his
will
may
be
done
his
will
not
his
reason
on
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
but
feeling
that
his
will
can
not
be
other
than
the
essence
of
our
will
the
desire
to
persist
eternally
and
such
a
god
is
the
god
of
love
he
is
it
profits
us
not
to
ask
but
rather
let
each
consult
his
own
heart
and
give
his
imagination
leave
to
picture
him
in
the
remoteness
of
the
universe
gazing
down
upon
him
with
those
myriad
eyes
of
his
that
shine
in
the
heavens
he
in
whom
you
believe
reader
he
is
your
god
he
who
has
lived
with
you
and
within
you
who
was
born
with
you
who
was
a
child
when
you
were
a
child
who
became
a
man
according
as
you
became
a
man
who
will
vanish
when
you
yourself
vanish
and
who
is
your
principle
of
continuity
in
the
spiritual
life
for
he
is
the
principle
of
solidarity
among
all
men
and
in
each
man
and
between
men
and
the
universe
and
he
is
as
you
are
a
person
and
if
you
believe
in
god
god
believes
in
you
and
believing
in
you
he
creates
you
continually
for
in
your
essence
you
are
nothing
but
the
idea
that
god
possesses
of
you
but
a
living
idea
because
the
idea
of
a
god
who
is
living
and
conscious
of
himself
of
a
and
apart
from
what
you
are
in
the
society
of
god
you
are
nothing
how
to
define
god
yes
that
is
our
longing
that
was
the
longing
of
the
man
jacob
when
after
wrestling
all
the
night
until
the
breaking
of
the
day
with
that
divine
visitant
he
cried
tell
me
i
pray
thee
thy
name
xxxii
listen
to
the
words
of
that
great
christian
preacher
frederick
william
robertson
in
a
sermon
preached
in
trinity
chapel
brighton
on
the
of
june
and
this
is
our
struggle
struggle
let
any
true
man
go
down
into
the
deeps
of
his
own
being
and
answer
us
what
is
the
cry
that
comes
from
the
most
real
part
of
his
nature
is
it
the
cry
for
daily
bread
jacob
asked
for
that
in
his
communing
with
god
preservation
safety
is
it
even
this
to
be
forgiven
our
sins
jacob
had
a
sin
to
be
forgiven
and
in
that
most
solemn
moment
of
his
existence
he
did
not
say
a
syllable
about
it
or
is
it
this
be
thy
name
no
my
brethren
out
of
our
frail
and
yet
sublime
humanity
the
demand
that
rises
in
the
earthlier
hours
of
our
religion
may
be
this
my
soul
but
in
the
most
unearthly
moments
it
is
this
me
thy
name
we
move
through
a
world
of
mystery
and
the
deepest
question
is
what
is
the
being
that
is
ever
near
sometimes
felt
never
seen
that
which
has
haunted
us
from
childhood
with
a
dream
of
something
surpassingly
fair
which
has
never
yet
been
realized
that
which
sweeps
through
the
soul
at
times
as
a
desolation
like
the
blast
from
the
wings
of
the
angel
of
death
leaving
us
stricken
and
silent
in
our
loneliness
that
which
has
touched
us
in
our
tenderest
point
and
the
flesh
has
quivered
with
agony
and
our
mortal
affections
have
shrivelled
up
with
pain
that
which
comes
to
us
in
aspirations
of
nobleness
and
conceptions
of
superhuman
excellence
shall
we
say
it
or
he
what
is
it
who
is
he
those
anticipations
of
immortality
and
god
what
are
they
are
they
the
mere
throbbings
of
my
own
heart
heard
and
mistaken
for
a
living
something
beside
me
are
they
the
sound
of
my
own
wishes
echoing
through
the
vast
void
of
nothingness
or
shall
i
call
them
god
father
spirit
love
a
living
being
within
me
or
outside
me
tell
me
thy
name
thou
awful
mystery
of
loveliness
this
is
the
struggle
of
all
earnest
life
thus
robertson
to
which
i
must
add
this
comment
that
tell
me
thy
name
is
essentially
the
same
as
save
my
soul
we
ask
him
his
name
in
order
that
he
may
save
our
soul
that
he
may
save
the
human
soul
that
he
may
save
the
human
finality
of
the
universe
and
if
they
tell
us
that
he
is
called
he
that
he
is
the
or
the
supreme
being
or
any
other
metaphysical
name
we
are
not
contented
for
we
know
that
every
metaphysical
name
is
an
x
and
we
go
on
asking
him
his
name
and
there
is
only
one
name
that
satisfies
our
longing
and
that
is
the
name
saviour
jesus
god
is
the
love
that
saves
as
browning
said
in
his
eve
and
easter
for
the
loving
worm
within
its
clod
were
diviner
than
a
loveless
god
amid
his
worlds
i
will
dare
to
say
the
essence
of
the
divine
is
love
will
that
personalizes
and
eternalizes
that
feels
the
hunger
for
eternity
and
infinity
it
is
ourselves
it
is
our
eternity
that
we
seek
in
god
it
is
our
divinization
it
was
browning
again
who
said
in
is
the
weakness
in
strength
that
i
cry
for
my
flesh
that
i
seek
in
the
godhead
but
this
god
who
saves
us
this
personal
god
the
consciousness
of
the
universe
who
envelops
and
sustains
our
consciousnesses
this
god
who
gives
human
finality
to
the
whole
creation
does
he
exist
have
we
proofs
of
his
existence
this
question
leads
in
the
first
place
to
an
enquiry
into
the
cleaning
of
this
notion
of
existence
what
is
it
to
exist
and
in
what
sense
do
we
speak
of
things
as
not
existing
in
its
etymological
signification
to
exist
is
to
be
outside
of
ourselves
outside
of
our
mind
but
is
there
anything
outside
of
our
mind
outside
of
our
consciousness
which
embraces
the
sum
of
the
known
undoubtedly
there
is
the
matter
of
knowledge
comes
to
us
from
without
and
what
is
the
mode
of
this
matter
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
know
for
to
know
is
to
clothe
matter
with
form
and
hence
we
can
not
know
the
formless
as
formless
to
do
so
would
be
tantamount
to
investing
chaos
with
order
this
problem
of
the
existence
of
god
a
problem
that
is
rationally
insoluble
is
really
identical
with
the
problem
of
consciousness
of
the
and
not
of
the
of
consciousness
it
is
none
other
than
the
problem
of
the
substantial
existence
of
the
soul
the
problem
of
the
perpetuity
of
the
human
soul
the
problem
of
the
human
finality
of
the
universe
itself
to
believe
in
a
living
and
personal
god
in
an
eternal
and
universal
consciousness
that
knows
and
loves
us
is
to
believe
that
the
universe
exists
man
for
man
or
for
a
consciousness
of
the
same
order
as
the
human
consciousness
of
the
same
nature
although
sublimated
a
consciousness
that
is
capable
of
knowing
us
in
the
depth
of
whose
being
our
memory
may
live
for
ever
perhaps
as
i
have
said
before
by
a
supreme
and
desperate
effort
of
resignation
we
might
succeed
in
making
the
sacrifice
of
our
personality
provided
that
we
knew
that
at
our
death
it
would
go
to
enrich
a
supreme
personality
provided
that
we
knew
that
the
universal
soul
was
nourished
by
our
souls
and
had
need
of
them
we
might
perhaps
meet
death
with
a
desperate
resignation
or
with
a
resigned
despair
delivering
up
our
soul
to
the
soul
of
humanity
bequeathing
to
it
our
work
the
work
that
bears
the
impress
of
our
person
if
it
were
certain
that
this
humanity
were
destined
to
bequeath
its
soul
in
its
turn
to
another
soul
when
at
long
last
consciousness
shall
have
become
extinct
upon
this
earth
but
is
it
certain
and
if
the
soul
of
humanity
is
eternal
if
the
human
collective
consciousness
is
eternal
if
there
is
a
consciousness
of
the
universe
and
if
this
consciousness
is
eternal
why
must
our
own
individual
consciousness
yours
reader
mine
be
not
eternal
in
the
vast
all
of
the
universe
must
there
be
this
unique
anomaly
a
consciousness
that
knows
itself
loves
itself
and
feels
itself
joined
to
an
organism
which
can
only
live
within
such
and
such
degrees
of
heat
a
merely
transitory
phenomenon
no
it
is
not
mere
curiosity
that
inspires
the
wish
to
know
whether
or
not
the
stars
are
inhabited
by
living
organisms
by
consciousnesses
akin
to
our
own
and
a
profound
longing
enters
into
that
dream
that
our
souls
shall
pass
from
star
to
star
through
the
vast
spaces
of
the
heavens
in
an
infinite
series
of
transmigrations
the
feeling
of
the
divine
makes
us
wish
and
believe
that
everything
is
animated
that
consciousness
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
extends
through
everything
we
wish
not
only
to
save
ourselves
but
to
save
the
world
from
nothingness
and
therefore
god
such
is
his
finality
as
we
feel
it
what
would
a
universe
be
without
any
consciousness
capable
of
reflecting
it
and
knowing
it
what
would
objectified
reason
be
without
will
and
feeling
for
us
it
would
be
equivalent
to
nothing
a
thousand
times
more
dreadful
than
nothing
if
such
a
supposition
is
reality
our
life
is
deprived
of
sense
and
value
it
is
not
therefore
rational
necessity
but
vital
anguish
that
impels
us
to
believe
in
god
and
to
believe
in
god
i
must
reiterate
it
yet
again
is
before
all
and
above
all
to
feel
a
hunger
for
god
a
hunger
for
divinity
to
be
sensible
of
his
lack
and
absence
to
wish
that
god
may
exist
and
it
is
to
wish
to
save
the
human
finality
of
the
universe
for
one
might
even
come
to
resign
oneself
to
being
absorbed
by
god
if
it
be
that
our
consciousness
is
based
upon
a
consciousness
if
consciousness
is
the
end
of
the
universe
the
wicked
man
hath
said
in
his
heart
there
is
no
god
and
this
is
truth
for
in
his
head
the
righteous
man
may
say
to
himself
god
does
not
exist
but
only
the
wicked
can
say
it
in
his
heart
not
to
believe
that
there
is
a
god
or
to
believe
that
there
is
not
a
god
is
one
thing
to
resign
oneself
to
there
not
being
a
god
is
another
thing
and
it
is
a
terrible
and
inhuman
thing
but
not
to
wish
that
there
be
a
god
exceeds
every
other
moral
monstrosity
although
as
a
matter
of
fact
those
who
deny
god
deny
him
because
of
their
despair
at
not
finding
him
and
now
reason
once
again
confronts
us
with
the
question
the
sphinx
in
effect
is
reason
does
god
exist
this
eternal
and
eternalizing
person
who
gives
meaning
and
i
will
add
a
human
meaning
for
there
is
none
other
to
the
universe
is
it
a
substantial
something
existing
independently
of
our
consciousness
independently
of
our
desire
here
we
arrive
at
the
insoluble
and
it
is
best
that
it
should
be
so
let
it
suffice
for
reason
that
it
can
not
prove
the
impossibility
of
his
existence
to
believe
in
god
is
to
long
for
his
existence
and
further
it
is
to
act
as
if
he
existed
it
is
to
live
by
this
longing
and
to
make
it
the
inner
spring
of
our
action
this
longing
or
hunger
for
divinity
begets
hope
hope
begets
faith
and
faith
and
hope
beget
charity
of
this
divine
longing
is
born
our
sense
of
beauty
of
finality
of
goodness
let
us

this

the

that
leads

the

what
is
faith
this
is
the
question
propounded
in
the

christian
doctrine
that
was
taught
us
at

and
the
answer

faith
is
believing
what
we

essay

twelve
years

i
amended
as
follows
believing
what
we
have
not
seen
no
but
creating
what
we
do
not
see
and
i
have
already
told
you
that
believing
in
god
is
in
the
first
instance
at
least
wishing
that
god
may
be
longing
for
the
existence
of
god
the
theological
virtue
of
faith
according
to
the
apostle
paul
whose
definition
serves
as
the
basis
of
the
traditional
christian
disquisitions
upon
it
is
the
substance
of
things

the
substance
or
rather
the
support
and
basis
of
hope
the
guarantee
of
it
that
which
connects
or
rather
than
connects
subordinates
faith
to
hope
and
in
fact
we
do
not
hope
because
we
believe
but
rather
we
believe
because
we
hope
it
is
hope
in
god
it
is
the
ardent
longing
that
there
may
be
a
god
who
guarantees
the
eternity
of
consciousness
that
leads
us
to
believe
in
him
but
faith
which
after
all
is
something
compound
comprising
a
cognitive
logical
or
rational
element
together
with
an
affective
biotic
sentimental
and
strictly
irrational
element
is
presented
to
us
under
the
form
of
knowledge
and
hence
the
insuperable
difficulty
of
separating
it
from
some
dogma
or
other
pure
faith
free
from
dogmas
about
which
i
wrote
a
great
deal
years
ago
is
a
phantasm
neither
is
the
difficulty
overcome
by
inventing
the
theory
of
faith
in
faith
itself
faith
needs
a
matter
to
work
upon
believing
is
a
form
of
knowing
even
if
it
be
no
more
than
a
knowing
and
even
a
formulating
of
our
vital
longing
in
ordinary
language
the
term
believing
however
is
used
in
a
double
and
even
a
contradictory
sense
it
may
express
on
the
one
hand
the
highest
degree
of
the
conviction
of
the
truth
of
a
thing
and
on
the
other
hand
it
may
imply
merely
a
weak
and
hesitating
persuasion
of
its
truth
for
if
in
one
sense
believing
expresses
the
firmest
kind
of
assent
we
are
capable
of
giving
the
expression
i
believe
that
it
is
so
although
i
am
not
sure
of
it
is
nevertheless
common
in
ordinary
speech
and
this
agrees
with
what
we
have
said
above
with
respect
to
uncertainty
as
the
basis
of
faith
the
most
robust
faith
in
so
far
as
it
is
distinguished
from
all
other
knowledge
that
is
not
or
of
faith
faithful
as
we
might
say
is
based
on
uncertainty
and
this
is
because
faith
the
guarantee
of
things
hoped
for
is
not
so
much
rational
adhesion
to
a
theoretical
principle
as
trust
in
a
person
who
assures
us
of
something
faith
supposes
an
objective
personal
element
we
do
not
so
much
believe
something
as
believe
someone
who
promises
us
or
assures
us
of
this
or
the
other
thing
we
believe
in
a
person
and
in
god
in
so
far
as
he
is
a
person
and
a
personalization
of
the
universe
this
personal
or
religious
element
in
faith
is
evident
faith
it
is
said
is
in
itself
neither
theoretical
knowledge
nor
rational
adhesion
to
a
truth
nor
yet
is
its
essence
sufficiently
explained
by
defining
it
as
trust
in
god
seeberg
says
of
faith
that
it
is
the
inward
submission
to
the
spiritual
authority
of
god
immediate
obedience
and
in
so
far
as
this
obedience
is
the
means
of
attaining
a
rational
principle
faith
is
a
personal
conviction
the
faith
which
paul
defined
in
greek
is
better
translated
as
trust
confidence
the
word
is
derived
from
the
verb
which
in
its
active
voice
means
to
persuade
and
in
its
middle
voice
to
trust
in
someone
to
esteem
him
as
worthy
of
trust
to
place
confidence
in
him
to
obey
and
to
trust
is
derived
from
the
root
whence
faith
and
also
confidence
the
greek
root
and
the
latin
are
twin
brothers
in
the
root
of
the
word
faith
itself
therefore
there
is
implicit
the
idea
of
confidence
of
surrender
to
the
will
of
another
to
a
person
confidence
is
placed
only
in
persons
we
trust
in
providence
which
we
conceive
as
something
personal
and
conscious
not
in
fate
which
is
something
impersonal
and
thus
it
is
in
the
person
who
tells
us
the
truth
in
the
person
who
gives
us
hope
that
we
believe
not
directly
and
immediately
in
truth
itself
or
in
hope
itself
and
this
personal
or
rather
personifying
element
in
faith
extends
even
to
the
lowest
forms
of
it
for
it
is
this
that
produces
faith
in
in
inspiration
in
miracle
there
is
a
story
of
a
parisian
doctor
who
when
he
found
that
a
was
drawing
away
his
clientèle
removed
to
a
quarter
of
the
city
as
distant
as
possible
from
his
former
abode
where
he
was
totally
unknown
and
here
he
gave
himself
out
as
a
and
conducted
himself
as
such
when
he
was
denounced
as
an
illegal
practitioner
he
produced
his
certificate
and
explained
his
action
more
or
less
as
follows
i
am
indeed
a
doctor
but
if
i
had
announced
myself
as
such
i
should
not
have
had
as
large
a
clientèle
as
i
have
as
a
now
that
all
my
clients
know
that
i
have
studied
medicine
however
and
that
i
am
a
properly
qualified
medical
man
they
will
desert
me
in
favour
of
some
quack
who
can
assure
them
that
he
has
never
studied
but
cures
simply
by
inspiration
and
true
it
is
that
a
doctor
is
discredited
when
it
is
proved
that
he
has
never
studied
medicine
and
possesses
no
qualifying
certificate
and
that
a
quack
is
discredited
when
it
is
proved
that
he
has
studied
and
is
a
qualified
practitioner
for
some
believe
in
science
and
in
study
while
others
believe
in
the
person
in
inspiration
and
even
in
ignorance
there
is
one
distinction
in
the
world
geography
which
comes
immediately
to
our
minds
when
we
thus
state
the
different
thoughts
and
desires
of
men
concerning
their
religion
we
remember
how
the
whole
world
is
in
general
divided
into
two
hemispheres
upon
this
matter
one
half
of
the
world
the
great
dim
east
is
mystic
it
insists
upon
not
seeing
anything
too
clearly
make
any
one
of
the
great
ideas
of
life
distinct
and
clear
and
immediately
it
seems
to
the
oriental
to
be
untrue
he
has
an
instinct
which
tells
him
that
the
vastest
thoughts
are
too
vast
for
the
human
mind
and
that
if
they
are
made
to
present
themselves
in
forms
of
statement
which
the
human
mind
can
comprehend
their
nature
is
violated
and
their
strength
is
lost
on
the
other
hand
the
occidental
the
man
of
the
west
demands
clearness
and
is
impatient
with
mystery
he
loves
a
definite
statement
as
much
as
his
brother
of
the
east
dislikes
it
he
insists
on
knowing
what
the
eternal
and
infinite
forces
mean
to
his
personal
life
how
they
will
make
him
personally
happier
and
better
almost
how
they
will
build
the
house
over
his
head
and
cook
the
dinner
on
his
hearth
this
is
the
difference
between
the
east
and
the
west
between
man
on
the
banks
of
the
ganges
and
man
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
plenty
of
exceptions
of
course
there
are
mystics
in
boston
and
louis
men
of
facts
in
bombay
and
calcutta
the
two
great
dispositions
can
not
be
shut
off
from
one
another
by
an
ocean
or
a
range
of
mountains
in
some
nations
and
places
as
for
instance
among
the
jews
and
in
our
own
new
england
they
notably
commingle
but
in
general
they
thus
divide
the
world
between
them
the
east
lives
in
the
moonlight
of
mystery
the
west
in
the
sunlight
of
scientific
fact
the
east
cries
out
to
the
eternal
for
vague
impulses
the
west
seizes
the
present
with
light
hands
and
will
not
let
it
go
till
it
has
furnished
it
with
reasonable
intelligible
motives
each
misunderstands
distrusts
and
in
large
degree
despises
the
other
but
the
two
hemispheres
together
and
not
either
one
by
itself
make
up
the
total
world
thus
in
one
of
his
sermons
spoke
the
great
unitarian
preacher
phillips
brooks
late
bishop
of
massachusetts
mystery
of
iniquity
and
other
sermon
we
might
rather
say
that
throughout
the
whole
world
in
the
east
as
well
as
in
the
west
rationalists
seek
definition
and
believe
in
the
concept
while
vitalists
seek
inspiration
and
believe
in
the
person
the
former
scrutinize
the
universe
in
order
that
they
may
wrest
its
secrets
from
it
the
latter
pray
to
the
consciousness
of
the
universe
strive
to
place
themselves
in
immediate
relationship
with
the
soul
of
the
world
with
god
in
order
that
they
may
find
the
guarantee
or
substance
of
what
they
hope
for
which
is
not
to
die
and
the
evidence
of
what
they
do
not
see
and
since
a
person
is
a
will
and
will
always
has
reference
to
the
future
he
who
believes
believes
in
what
is
to
come
that
is
in
what
he
hopes
for
we
do
not
believe
strictly
speaking
in
what
is
or
in
what
was
except
as
the
guarantee
as
the
substance
of
what
will
be
for
the
christian
to
believe
in
the
resurrection
of
christ
that
is
to
say
in
tradition
and
in
the
gospel
which
assure
him
that
christ
has
risen
both
of
them
personal
forces
is
to
believe
that
he
himself
will
one
day
rise
again
by
the
grace
of
christ
and
even
scientific
faith
for
such
there
is
refers
to
the
future
and
is
an
act
of
trust
the
man
of
science
believes
that
at
a
certain
future
date
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
will
take
place
he
believes
that
the
laws
which
have
governed
the
world
hitherto
will
continue
to
govern
it
to
believe
i
repeat
is
to
place
confidence
in
someone
and
it
has
reference
to
a
person
i
say
that
i
know
that
there
is
an
animal
called
the
horse
and
that
it
has
such
and
such
characteristics
because
i
have
seen
it
and
i
say
that
i
believe
in
the
existence
of
the
giraffe
or
the
ornithorhyncus
and
that
it
possesses
such
and
such
qualities
because
i
believe
those
who
assure
me
that
they
have
seen
it
and
hence
the
element
of
uncertainty
attached
to
faith
for
it
is
possible
that
a
person
may
be
deceived
or
that
he
may
deceive
us
but
on
the
other
hand
this
personal
element
in
belief
gives
it
an
effective
and
loving
character
and
above
all
in
religious
faith
a
reference
to
what
is
hoped
for
perhaps
there
is
nobody
who
would
sacrifice
his
life
for
the
sake
of
maintaining
that
the
three
angles
of
a
triangle
are
together
equal
to
two
right
angles
for
such
a
truth
does
not
demand
the
sacrifice
of
our
life
but
on
the
other
hand
there
are
many
who
have
lost
their
lives
for
the
sake
of
maintaining
their
religious
faith
indeed
it
is
truer
to
say
that
martyrs
make
faith
than
that
faith
makes
martyrs
for
faith
is
not
the
mere
adherence
of
the
intellect
to
an
abstract
principle
it
is
not
the
recognition
of
a
theoretical
truth
a
process
in
which
the
will
merely
sets
in
motion
our
faculty
of
comprehension
faith
is
an
act
of
the
will
it
is
a
movement
of
the
soul
towards
a
practical
truth
towards
a
person
towards
something
that
makes
us
not
merely
comprehend
life
but
that
makes
us
live
faith
makes
us
live
by
showing
us
that
life
although
it
is
dependent
upon
reason
has
its
and
source
of
power
elsewhere
in
something
supernatural
and
miraculous
cournot
the
mathematician
a
man
of
singularly
and
scientifically
equipped
mind
has
said
that
it
is
this
tendency
towards
the
supernatural
and
miraculous
that
gives
life
and
that
when
it
is
lacking
all
the
speculations
of
the
reason
lead
to
nothing
but
affliction
of
spirit
de
des
idées
fondamentales
dans
les
sciences
et
dans
and
in
truth
we
wish
to
live
but
although
we
have
said
that
faith
is
a
thing
of
the
will
it
would
perhaps
be
better
to
say
that
it
is
will
itself
the
will
not
to
die
or
rather
that
it
is
some
other
psychic
force
distinct
from
intelligence
will
and
feeling
we
should
thus
have
feeling
knowing
willing
and
believing
or
creating
for
neither
feeling
nor
intelligence
nor
will
creates
they
operate
upon
a
material
already
given
upon
the
material
given
them
by
faith
faith
is
the
creative
power
in
man
but
since
it
has
a
more
intimate
relation
with
the
will
than
with
any
other
of
his
faculties
we
conceive
it
under
the
form
of
volition
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
however
that
wishing
to
believe
that
is
to
say
wishing
to
create
is
not
precisely
the
same
as
believing
or
creating
although
it
is
its
faith
therefore
if
not
a
creative
force
is
the
fruit
of
the
will
and
its
function
is
to
create
faith
in
a
certain
sense
creates
its
object
and
faith
in
god
consists
in
creating
god
and
since
it
is
god
who
gives
us
faith
in
himself
it
is
god
who
is
continually
creating
himself
in
us
therefore
augustine
said
i
will
seek
thee
lord
by
calling
upon
thee
and
i
will
call
upon
thee
by
believing
in
thee
my
faith
calls
upon
thee
lord
the
faith
which
thou
hast
given
me
with
which
thou
hast
inspired
me
through
the
humanity
of
thy
son
through
the
ministry
of
thy
preacher
book
chap
the
power
of
creating
god
in
our
own
image
and
likeness
of
personalizing
the
universe
simply
means
that
we
carry
god
within
us
as
the
substance
of
what
we
hope
for
and
that
god
is
continually
creating
us
in
his
own
image
and
likeness
and
we
create
god
that
is
to
say
god
creates
himself
in
us
by
compassion
by
love
to
believe
in
god
is
to
love
him
and
in
our
love
to
fear
him
and
we
begin
by
loving
him
even
before
knowing
him
and
by
loving
him
we
come
at
last
to
see
and
discover
him
in
all
things
those
who
say
that
they
believe
in
god
and
yet
neither
love
nor
fear
him
do
not
in
fact
believe
in
him
but
in
those
who
have
taught
them
that
god
exists
and
these
in
their
turn
often
enough
do
not
believe
in
him
either
those
who
believe
that
they
believe
in
god
but
without
any
passion
in
their
heart
without
anguish
of
mind
without
uncertainty
without
doubt
without
an
element
of
despair
even
in
their
consolation
believe
only
in
the
not
in
god
himself
and
just
as
belief
in
god
is
born
of
love
so
also
it
may
be
born
of
fear
and
even
of
hate
and
of
such
kind
was
the
belief
of
vanni
fucci
the
thief
whom
dante
depicts
insulting
god
with
obscene
gestures
in
hell
for
the
devils
also
believe
in
god
and
not
a
few
atheists
is
it
not
perhaps
a
mode
of
believing
in
god
this
fury
with
which
those
deny
and
even
insult
him
who
because
they
can
not
bring
themselves
to
believe
in
him
wish
that
he
may
not
exist
like
those
who
believe
they
too
wish
that
god
may
exist
but
being
men
of
a
weak
and
passive
or
of
an
evil
disposition
in
whom
reason
is
stronger
than
will
they
feel
themselves
caught
in
the
grip
of
reason
and
haled
along
in
their
own
despite
and
they
fall
into
despair
and
because
of
their
despair
they
deny
and
in
their
denial
they
affirm
and
create
the
thing
that
they
deny
and
god
reveals
himself
in
them
affirming
himself
by
their
very
denial
of
him
but
it
will
be
objected
to
all
this
that
to
demonstrate
that
faith
creates
its
own
object
is
to
demonstrate
that
this
object
is
an
object
for
faith
alone
that
outside
faith
it
has
no
objective
reality
just
as
on
the
other
hand
to
maintain
that
faith
is
necessary
because
it
affords
consolation
to
the
masses
of
the
people
or
imposes
a
wholesome
restraint
upon
them
is
to
declare
that
the
object
of
faith
is
illusory
what
is
certain
is
that
for
thinking
believers
faith
is
before
all
and
above
all
wishing
that
god
may
exist
wishing
that
god
may
exist
and
acting
and
feeling
as
if
he
did
exist
and
desiring
god
existence
and
acting
conformably
with
this
desire
is
the
means
whereby
we
create
god
that
is
whereby
god
creates
himself
in
us
manifests
himself
to
us
opens
and
reveals
himself
to
us
for
god
goes
out
to
meet
him
who
seeks
him
with
love
and
by
love
and
hides
himself
from
him
who
searches
for
him
with
the
cold
and
loveless
reason
god
wills
that
the
heart
should
have
rest
but
not
the
head
reversing
the
order
of
the
physical
life
in
which
the
head
sleeps
and
rests
at
times
while
the
heart
wakes
and
works
unceasingly
and
thus
knowledge
without
love
leads
us
away
from
god
and
love
even
without
knowledge
and
perhaps
better
without
it
leads
us
to
god
and
through
god
to
wisdom
blessed
are
the
pure
in
heart
for
they
shall
see
god
and
if
you
should
ask
me
how
i
believe
in
god
that
is
to
say
how
god
creates
himself
in
me
and
reveals
himself
to
me
my
answer
may
perhaps
provoke
your
smiles
or
your
laughter
or
it
may
even
scandalize
you
i
believe
in
god
as
i
believe
in
my
friends
because
i
feel
the
breath
of
his
affection
feel
his
invisible
and
intangible
hand
drawing
me
leading
me
grasping
me
because
i
possess
an
inner
consciousness
of
a
particular
providence
and
of
a
universal
mind
that
marks
out
for
me
the
course
of
my
own
destiny
and
the
concept
of
law
it
is
nothing
but
a
concept
after
all
tells
me
nothing
and
teaches
me
nothing
once
and
again
in
my
life
i
have
seen
myself
suspended
in
a
trance
over
the
abyss
once
and
again
i
have
found
myself
at
the
confronted
by
a
choice
of
ways
and
aware
that
in
choosing
one
i
should
be
renouncing
all
the
others
for
there
is
no
turning
back
upon
these
roads
of
life
and
once
and
again
in
such
unique
moments
as
these
i
have
felt
the
impulse
of
a
mighty
power
conscious
sovereign
and
loving
and
then
before
the
feet
of
the
wayfarer
opens
out
the
way
of
the
lord
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
feel
the
universe
calling
to
him
and
guiding
him
as
one
person
guides
and
calls
to
another
to
hear
within
him
its
voice
speaking
without
words
and
saying
go
and
preach
to
all
peoples
how
do
you
know
that
the
man
you
see
before
you
possesses
a
consciousness
like
you
and
that
an
animal
also
possesses
such
a
consciousness
more
or
less
dimly
but
not
a
stone
because
the
man
acts
towards
you
like
a
man
like
a
being
made
in
your
likeness
and
because
the
stone
does
not
act
towards
you
at
all
but
suffers
you
to
act
upon
it
and
in
the
same
way
i
believe
that
the
universe
possesses
a
certain
consciousness
like
myself
because
its
action
towards
me
is
a
human
action
and
i
feel
that
it
is
a
personality
that
environs
me
here
is
a
formless
mass
it
appears
to
be
a
kind
of
animal
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
its
members
i
only
see
two
eyes
eyes
which
gaze
at
me
with
a
human
gaze
the
gaze
of
a
a
gaze
which
asks
for
pity
and
i
hear
it
breathing
i
conclude
that
in
this
formless
mass
there
is
a
consciousness
in
just
such
a
way
and
none
other
the
heavens
gaze
down
upon
the
believer
with
a
superhuman
a
divine
gaze
a
gaze
that
asks
for
supreme
pity
and
supreme
love
and
in
the
serenity
of
the
night
he
hears
the
breathing
of
god
and
god
touches
him
in
his
heart
of
hearts
and
reveals
himself
to
him
it
is
the
universe
living
suffering
loving
and
asking
for
love
from
loving
little
trifling
material
things
which
lightly
come
and
lightly
go
having
no
deep
root
in
our
affections
we
come
to
love
the
more
lasting
things
the
things
which
our
hands
can
not
grasp
from
loving
goods
we
come
to
love
the
good
from
loving
beautiful
things
we
come
to
love
beauty
from
loving
the
true
we
come
to
love
the
truth
from
loving
pleasures
we
come
to
love
happiness
and
last
of
all
we
come
to
love
love
we
emerge
from
ourselves
in
order
to
penetrate
further
into
our
supreme
i
individual
consciousness
emerges
from
us
in
order
to
submerge
itself
in
the
total
consciousness
of
which
we
form
a
part
but
without
being
dissolved
in
it
and
god
is
simply
the
love
that
springs
from
universal
suffering
and
becomes
consciousness
but
this
it
will
be
said
is
merely
to
revolve
in
an
iron
ring
for
such
a
god
is
not
objective
and
at
this
point
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
give
reason
its
due
and
to
examine
exactly
what
is
meant
by
a
thing
existing
being
objective
what
is
it
in
effect
to
exist
and
when
do
we
say
that
a
thing
exists
a
thing
exists
when
it
is
placed
outside
us
and
in
such
a
way
that
it
shall
have
preceded
our
perception
of
it
and
be
capable
of
continuing
to
subsist
outside
us
after
we
have
disappeared
but
have
i
any
certainty
that
anything
has
preceded
me
or
that
anything
must
survive
me
can
my
consciousness
know
that
there
is
anything
outside
it
everything
that
i
know
or
can
know
is
within
my
consciousness
we
will
not
entangle
ourselves
therefore
in
the
insoluble
problem
of
an
objectivity
outside
our
perceptions
things
exist
in
so
far
as
they
act
to
exist
is
to
act
but
now
it
will
be
said
that
it
is
not
god
but
the
idea
of
god
that
acts
in
us
to
which
we
shall
reply
that
it
is
sometimes
god
acting
by
his
idea
but
still
very
often
it
is
rather
god
acting
in
us
by
himself
and
the
retort
will
be
a
demand
for
proofs
of
the
objective
truth
of
the
existence
of
god
since
we
ask
for
signs
and
we
shall
have
to
answer
with
pilate
what
is
truth
and
having
asked
this
question
pilate
turned
away
without
waiting
for
an
answer
and
proceeded
to
wash
his
hands
in
order
that
he
might
exculpate
himself
for
having
allowed
christ
to
be
condemned
to
death
and
there
are
many
who
ask
this
question
what
is
truth
but
without
any
intention
of
waiting
for
the
answer
and
solely
in
order
that
they
may
turn
away
and
wash
their
hands
of
the
crime
of
having
helped
to
kill
and
eject
god
from
their
own
consciousness
or
from
the
consciousness
of
others
what
is
truth
there
are
two
kinds
of
truth
the
logical
or
objective
the
opposite
of
which
is
error
and
the
moral
or
subjective
the
opposite
of
which
is
falsehood
and
in
a
previous
essay
i
have
endeavoured
to
show
that
error
is
the
fruit
of
falsehood
moral
truth
the
road
that
leads
to
intellectual
truth
which
also
is
moral
inculcates
the
study
of
science
which
is
over
and
above
all
a
school
of
sincerity
and
humility
science
teaches
us
in
effect
to
submit
our
reason
to
the
truth
and
to
know
and
judge
of
things
as
they
are
that
is
to
say
as
they
themselves
choose
to
be
and
not
as
we
would
have
them
be
in
a
religiously
scientific
investigation
it
is
the
data
of
reality
themselves
it
is
the
perceptions
which
we
receive
from
the
outside
world
that
formulate
themselves
in
our
mind
as
laws
it
is
not
we
ourselves
who
thus
formulate
them
it
is
the
numbers
themselves
which
in
our
mind
create
mathematics
science
is
the
most
intimate
school
of
resignation
and
humility
for
it
teaches
us
to
bow
before
the
seemingly
most
insignificant
of
facts
and
it
is
the
gateway
of
religion
but
within
the
temple
itself
its
function
ceases
and
just
as
there
is
logical
truth
opposed
to
error
and
moral
truth
opposed
to
falsehood
so
there
is
also
esthetic
truth
or
verisimilitude
which
is
opposed
to
extravagance
and
religious
truth
or
hope
which
is
opposed
to
the
inquietude
of
absolute
despair
for
esthetic
verisimilitude
the
expression
of
which
is
sensible
differs
from
logical
truth
the
demonstration
of
which
is
rational
and
religious
truth
the
truth
of
faith
the
substance
of
things
hoped
for
is
not
equivalent
to
moral
truth
but
superimposes
itself
upon
it
he
who
affirms
a
faith
built
upon
a
basis
of
uncertainty
does
not
and
can
not
lie
and
not
only
do
we
not
believe
with
reason
nor
yet
above
reason
nor
below
reason
but
we
believe
against
reason
religious
faith
it
must
be
repeated
yet
again
is
not
only
irrational
it
is
kierkegaard
says
poetry
is
illusion
before
knowledge
religion
illusion
after
knowledge
between
poetry
and
religion
the
worldly
wisdom
of
living
plays
its
comedy
every
individual
who
does
not
live
either
poetically
or
religiously
is
a
fool
uvidenskabelig
chap
sect
the
same
writer
tells
us
that
christianity
is
a
desperate
sortie
even
so
but
it
is
only
by
the
very
desperateness
of
this
sortie
that
we
can
win
through
to
hope
to
that
hope
whose
vitalizing
illusion
is
of
more
force
than
all
rational
knowledge
and
which
assures
us
that
there
is
always
something
that
can
not
be
reduced
to
reason
and
of
reason
the
same
may
be
said
as
was
said
of
christ
that
he
who
is
not
with
it
is
against
it
that
which
is
not
rational
is
and
such
is
hope
by
this
circuitous
route
we
always
arrive
at
hope
in
the
end
to
the
mystery
of
love
which
is
the
mystery
of
suffering
belongs
a
mysterious
form
and
this
form
is
time
we
join
yesterday
to
with
links
of
longing
and
the
now
is
strictly
nothing
but
the
endeavour
of
the
before
to
make
itself
the
after
the
present
is
simply
the
determination
of
the
past
to
become
the
future
the
now
is
a
point
which
if
not
sharply
articulated
vanishes
and
nevertheless
in
this
point
is
all
eternity
the
substance
of
time
everything
that
has
been
can
be
only
as
it
was
and
everything
that
is
can
be
only
as
it
is
the
possible
is
always
relegated
to
the
future
the
sole
domain
of
liberty
wherein
imagination
the
creative
and
liberating
energy
the
incarnation
of
faith
has
space
to
roam
at
large
love
ever
looks
and
tends
to
the
future
for
its
work
is
the
work
of
our
perpetuation
the
property
of
love
is
to
hope
and
only
upon
hopes
does
it
nourish
itself
and
thus
when
love
sees
the
fruition
of
its
desire
it
becomes
sad
for
it
then
discovers
that
what
it
desired
was
not
its
true
end
and
that
god
gave
it
this
desire
merely
as
a
lure
to
spur
it
to
action
it
discovers
that
its
end
is
further
on
and
it
sets
out
again
upon
its
toilsome
pilgrimage
through
life
revolving
through
a
constant
cycle
of
illusions
and
disillusions
and
continually
it
transforms
its
frustrated
hopes
into
memories
and
from
these
memories
it
draws
fresh
hopes
from
the
subterranean
ore
of
memory
we
extract
the
jewelled
visions
of
our
future
imagination
shapes
our
remembrances
into
hopes
and
humanity
is
like
a
young
girl
full
of
longings
hungering
for
life
and
thirsting
for
love
who
weaves
her
days
with
dreams
and
hopes
hopes
ever
hopes
without
ceasing
for
the
eternal
and
predestined
lover
for
him
who
because
he
was
destined
for
her
from
the
beginning
from
before
the
dawn
of
her
remotest
memory
from
before
her
shall
live
with
her
and
for
her
into
the
illimitable
future
beyond
the
stretch
of
her
furthest
hopes
beyond
the
grave
itself
and
for
this
poor
lovelorn
humanity
as
for
the
girl
ever
awaiting
her
lover
there
is
no
kinder
wish
than
that
when
the
winter
of
life
shall
come
it
may
find
the
sweet
dreams
of
its
spring
changed
into
memories
sweeter
still
and
memories
that
shall
burgeon
into
new
hopes
in
the
days
when
our
summer
is
over
what
a
flow
of
calm
felicity
of
resignation
to
destiny
must
come
from
remembering
hopes
which
have
never
been
realized
and
which
because
they
have
never
been
realized
preserve
their
pristine
purity
love
hopes
hopes
ever
and
never
wearies
of
hoping
and
love
of
god
our
faith
in
god
is
above
all
hope
in
him
for
god
dies
not
and
he
who
hopes
in
god
shall
live
for
ever
and
our
fundamental
hope
the
root
and
stem
of
all
our
hopes
is
the
hope
of
eternal
life
and
if
faith
is
the
substance
of
hope
hope
in
its
turn
is
the
form
of
faith
until
it
gives
us
hope
our
faith
is
a
formless
faith
vague
chaotic
potential
it
is
but
the
possibility
of
believing
the
longing
to
believe
but
we
must
needs
believe
in
something
and
we
believe
in
what
we
hope
for
we
believe
in
hope
we
remember
the
past
we
know
the
present
we
only
believe
in
the
future
to
believe
what
we
have
not
seen
is
to
believe
what
we
shall
see
faith
then
i
repeat
once
again
is
faith
in
hope
we
believe
what
we
hope
for
love
makes
us
believe
in
god
in
whom
we
hope
and
from
whom
we
hope
to
receive
life
to
come
love
makes
us
believe
in
that
which
the
dream
of
hope
creates
for
us
faith
is
our
longing
for
the
eternal
for
god
and
hope
is
longing
the
longing
of
the
eternal
of
the
divine
in
us
which
advances
to
meet
our
faith
and
uplifts
us
man
aspires
to
god
by
faith
and
cries
to
him
i
believe
give
me
lord
wherein
to
believe
and
god
the
divinity
in
man
sends
him
hope
in
another
life
in
order
that
he
may
believe
in
it
hope
is
the
reward
of
faith
only
he
who
believes
truly
hopes
and
only
he
who
truly
hopes
believes
we
only
believe
what
we
hope
and
we
only
hope
what
we
believe
it
was
hope
that
called
god
by
the
name
of
father
and
this
name
so
comforting
yet
so
mysterious
is
still
bestowed
upon
him
by
hope
the
father
gave
us
life
and
gives
bread
wherewith
to
sustain
it
and
we
ask
the
father
to
preserve
our
life
for
us
and
if
christ
was
he
who
with
the
fullest
heart
and
purest
mouth
named
with
the
name
of
father
his
father
and
ours
if
the
noblest
feeling
of
christianity
is
the
feeling
of
the
fatherhood
of
god
it
is
because
in
christ
the
human
race
sublimated
its
hunger
for
eternity
it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
this
longing
of
faith
that
this
hope
is
more
than
anything
else
an
esthetic
feeling
possibly
the
esthetic
feeling
enters
into
it
but
without
completely
satisfying
it
we
seek
in
art
an
image
of
eternalization
if
for
a
brief
moment
our
spirit
finds
peace
and
rest
and
assuagement
in
the
contemplation
of
the
beautiful
even
though
it
finds
therein
no
real
cure
for
its
distress
it
is
because
the
beautiful
is
the
revelation
of
the
eternal
of
the
divine
in
things
and
beauty
but
the
perpetuation
of
momentaneity
just
as
truth
is
the
goal
of
rational
knowledge
so
beauty
is
the
goal
of
hope
which
is
perhaps
in
its
essence
irrational
nothing
is
lost
nothing
wholly
passes
away
for
in
some
way
or
another
everything
is
perpetuated
and
everything
after
passing
through
time
returns
to
eternity
the
temporal
world
has
its
roots
in
eternity
and
in
eternity
yesterday
is
united
with
and
the
scenes
of
life
pass
before
us
as
in
a
cinematograph
show
but
on
the
further
side
of
time
the
film
is
one
and
indivisible
physicists
affirm
that
not
a
single
particle
of
matter
nor
a
single
tremor
of
energy
is
lost
but
that
each
is
transformed
and
transmitted
and
persists
and
can
it
be
that
any
form
however
fugitive
it
may
be
is
lost
we
must
needs
believe
believe
and
hope
that
it
is
not
but
that
somewhere
it
remains
archived
and
perpetuated
and
that
there
is
some
mirror
of
eternity
in
which
without
losing
themselves
in
one
another
all
the
images
that
pass
through
time
are
received
every
impression
that
reaches
me
remains
stored
up
in
my
brain
even
though
it
may
be
so
deep
or
so
weak
that
it
is
buried
in
the
depths
of
my
subconsciousness
but
from
these
depths
it
animates
my
life
and
if
the
whole
of
my
spirit
the
total
content
of
my
soul
were
to
awake
to
full
consciousness
all
these
dimly
perceived
and
forgotten
fugitive
impressions
would
come
to
life
again
including
even
those
which
i
had
never
been
aware
of
i
carry
within
me
everything
that
has
passed
before
me
and
i
perpetuate
it
with
myself
and
it
may
be
that
it
all
goes
into
my
germs
and
that
all
my
ancestors
live
undiminished
in
me
and
will
continue
so
to
live
united
with
me
in
my
descendants
and
perhaps
i
the
whole
i
with
all
this
universe
of
mine
enter
into
each
one
of
my
actions
or
at
all
events
that
which
is
essential
in
me
enters
into
them
that
which
makes
me
myself
my
individual
essence
and
how
is
this
individual
essence
in
each
several
thing
that
which
makes
it
itself
and
not
another
revealed
to
us
save
as
beauty
what
is
the
beauty
of
anything
but
its
eternal
essence
that
which
unites
its
past
with
its
future
that
element
of
it
that
rests
and
abides
in
the
womb
of
eternity
or
rather
what
is
it
but
the
revelation
of
its
divinity
and
this
beauty
which
is
the
root
of
eternity
is
revealed
to
us
by
love
it
is
the
supreme
revelation
of
the
love
of
god
and
the
token
of
our
ultimate
victory
over
time
it
is
love
that
reveals
to
us
the
eternal
in
us
and
in
our
neighbours
is
it
the
beautiful
the
eternal
in
things
that
awakens
and
kindles
our
love
for
them
or
is
it
our
love
for
things
that
reveals
to
us
the
beautiful
the
eternal
in
them
is
not
beauty
perhaps
a
creation
of
love
in
the
same
way
and
in
the
same
sense
that
the
sensible
world
is
a
creation
of
the
instinct
of
preservation
and
the
supersensible
world
of
that
of
perpetuation
is
not
beauty
and
together
with
beauty
eternity
a
creation
of
love
though
our
outward
man
perish
says
the
apostle
yet
the
inward
man
is
renewed
day
by
day
cor
iv
the
man
of
passing
appearances
perishes
and
passes
away
with
them
the
man
of
reality
remains
and
grows
for
our
light
affliction
which
is
but
for
a
moment
worketh
for
us
a
far
more
exceeding
and
eternal
weight
of
glory
ver
our
suffering
causes
us
anguish
and
this
anguish
bursting
because
of
its
own
fullness
seems
to
us
consolation
while
we
look
not
at
the
things
which
are
seen
but
at
the
things
which
are
not
seen
for
the
things
which
are
seen
are
temporal
but
the
things
which
are
not
seen
are
eternal
ver
this
suffering
gives
hope
which
is
the
beautiful
in
life
the
supreme
beauty
or
the
supreme
consolation
and
since
love
is
full
of
suffering
since
love
is
compassion
and
pity
beauty
springs
from
compassion
and
is
simply
the
temporal
consolation
that
compassion
seeks
a
tragic
consolation
and
the
supreme
beauty
is
that
of
tragedy
the
consciousness
that
everything
passes
away
that
we
ourselves
pass
away
and
that
everything
that
is
ours
and
everything
that
environs
us
passes
away
fills
us
with
anguish
and
this
anguish
itself
reveals
to
us
the
consolation
of
that
which
does
not
pass
away
of
the
eternal
of
the
beautiful
and
this
beauty
thus
revealed
this
perpetuation
of
momentaneity
only
realizes
itself
practically
only
lives
through
the
work
of
charity
hope
in
action
is
charity
and
beauty
in
action
is
goodness
charity
which
eternalizes
everything
it
loves
and
in
giving
us
the
goodness
of
it
brings
to
light
its
hidden
beauty
has
its
root
in
the
love
of
god
or
if
you
like
in
charity
towards
god
in
pity
for
god
love
pity
personalizes
everything
we
have
said
in
discovering
the
suffering
in
everything
and
in
personalizing
everything
it
personalizes
the
universe
itself
as
well
for
the
universe
also
suffers
and
it
discovers
god
to
us
for
god
is
revealed
to
us
because
he
suffers
and
because
we
suffer
because
he
suffers
he
demands
our
love
and
because
we
suffer
he
gives
us
his
love
and
he
covers
our
anguish
with
the
eternal
and
infinite
anguish
this
was
the
scandal
of
christianity
among
jews
and
greeks
among
pharisees
and
stoics
and
this
which
was
its
scandal
of
old
the
scandal
of
the
cross
is
still
its
scandal
and
will
continue
to
be
so
even
among
christians
themselves
the
scandal
of
a
god
who
becomes
man
in
order
that
he
may
suffer
and
die
and
rise
again
because
he
has
suffered
and
died
the
scandal
of
a
god
subject
to
suffering
and
death
and
this
truth
that
god
suffers
a
truth
that
appals
the
mind
of
man
is
the
revelation
of
the
very
heart
of
the
universe
and
of
its
mystery
the
revelation
that
god
revealed
to
us
when
he
sent
his
son
in
order
that
he
might
redeem
us
by
suffering
and
dying
it
was
the
revelation
of
the
divine
in
suffering
for
only
that
which
suffers
is
divine
and
men
made
a
god
of
this
christ
who
suffered
and
through
him
they
discovered
the
eternal
essence
of
a
living
human
god
that
is
of
a
god
who
suffers
it
is
only
the
dead
the
inhuman
that
does
not
suffer
a
god
who
loves
and
thirsts
for
love
for
pity
a
god
who
is
a
person
whosoever
knows
not
the
son
will
never
know
the
father
and
the
father
is
only
known
through
the
son
whosoever
knows
not
the
son
of
man
he
who
suffers
bloody
anguish
and
the
pangs
of
a
breaking
heart
whose
soul
is
heavy
within
him
even
unto
death
who
suffers
the
pain
that
kills
and
brings
to
life
again
will
never
know
the
father
and
can
know
nothing
of
the
suffering
god
he
who
does
not
suffer
and
who
does
not
suffer
because
he
does
not
live
is
that
logical
and
frozen
the
that
impassive
entity
which
because
of
its
impassivity
is
nothing
but
a
pure
idea
the
category
does
not
suffer
but
neither
does
it
live
or
exist
as
a
person
and
how
is
the
world
to
derive
its
origin
and
life
from
an
impassive
idea
such
a
world
would
be
but
the
idea
of
the
world
but
the
world
suffers
and
suffering
is
the
sense
of
the
flesh
of
reality
it
is
the
spirit
sense
of
its
mass
and
substance
it
is
the
self
sense
of
its
own
tangibility
it
is
immediate
reality
suffering
is
the
substance
of
life
and
the
root
of
personality
for
it
is
only
suffering
that
makes
us
persons
and
suffering
is
universal
suffering
is
that
which
unites
all
us
living
beings
together
it
is
the
universal
or
divine
blood
that
flows
through
us
all
that
which
we
call
will
what
is
it
but
suffering
and
suffering
has
its
degrees
according
to
the
depth
of
its
penetration
from
the
suffering
that
floats
upon
the
sea
of
appearances
to
the
eternal
anguish
the
source
of
the
tragic
sense
of
life
which
seeks
a
habitation
in
the
depths
of
the
eternal
and
there
awakens
consolation
from
the
physical
suffering
that
contorts
our
bodies
to
the
religious
anguish
that
flings
us
upon
the
bosom
of
god
there
to
be
watered
by
the
divine
tears
anguish
is
something
far
deeper
more
intimate
and
more
spiritual
than
suffering
we
are
wont
to
feel
the
touch
of
anguish
even
in
the
midst
of
that
which
we
call
happiness
and
even
because
of
this
happiness
itself
to
which
we
can
not
resign
ourselves
and
before
which
we
tremble
the
happy
who
resign
themselves
to
their
apparent
happiness
to
a
transitory
happiness
seem
to
be
as
men
without
substance
or
at
any
rate
men
who
have
not
discovered
this
substance
in
themselves
who
have
not
touched
it
such
men
are
usually
incapable
of
loving
or
of
being
loved
and
they
go
through
life
without
really
knowing
either
pain
or
bliss
there
is
no
true
love
save
in
suffering
and
in
this
world
we
have
to
choose
either
love
which
is
suffering
or
happiness
and
love
leads
us
to
no
other
happiness
than
that
of
love
itself
and
its
tragic
consolation
of
uncertain
hope
the
moment
love
becomes
happy
and
satisfied
it
no
longer
desires
and
it
is
no
longer
love
the
satisfied
the
happy
do
not
love
they
fall
asleep
in
habit
near
neighbour
to
annihilation
to
fall
into
a
habit
is
to
begin
to
cease
to
be
man
is
the
more
man
that
is
the
more
divine
the
greater
his
capacity
for
suffering
or
rather
for
anguish
at
our
coming
into
the
world
it
is
given
to
us
to
choose
between
love
and
happiness
and
we
wish
poor
fools
for
both
the
happiness
of
loving
and
the
love
of
happiness
but
we
ought
to
ask
for
the
gift
of
love
and
not
of
happiness
and
to
be
preserved
from
dozing
away
into
habit
lest
we
should
fall
into
a
fast
sleep
a
sleep
without
waking
and
so
lose
our
consciousness
beyond
power
of
recovery
we
ought
to
ask
god
to
make
us
conscious
of
ourselves
in
ourselves
in
our
suffering
what
is
fate
what
is
fatality
but
the
brotherhood
of
love
and
suffering
what
is
it
but
that
terrible
mystery
in
virtue
of
which
love
dies
as
soon
as
it
touches
the
happiness
towards
which
it
reaches
out
and
true
happiness
dies
with
it
love
and
suffering
mutually
engender
one
another
and
love
is
charity
and
compassion
and
the
love
that
is
not
charitable
and
compassionate
is
not
love
love
in
a
word
is
resigned
despair
that
which
the
mathematicians
call
the
problem
of
maxima
and
minima
which
is
also
called
the
law
of
economy
is
the
formula
for
all
existential
that
is
passional
activity
in
material
mechanics
and
in
social
mechanics
in
industry
and
in
political
economy
every
problem
resolves
itself
into
an
attempt
to
obtain
the
greatest
possible
resulting
utility
with
the
least
possible
effort
the
greatest
income
with
the
least
expenditure
the
most
pleasure
with
the
least
pain
and
the
terrible
and
tragic
formula
of
the
inner
spiritual
life
is
either
to
obtain
the
most
happiness
with
the
least
love
or
the
most
love
with
the
least
happiness
and
it
is
necessary
to
choose
between
the
one
and
the
other
and
to
know
that
he
who
approaches
the
infinite
of
love
the
love
that
is
infinite
approaches
the
zero
of
happiness
the
supreme
anguish
and
in
reaching
this
zero
he
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
misery
that
kills
be
not
and
thou
shalt
be
mightier
than
aught
that
is
said
brother
juan
de
los
angeles
in
one
of
his
de
la
conquista
del
reino
de
dial
iii
and
there
is
something
still
more
anguishing
than
suffering
a
man
about
to
receive
a
blow
expects
to
have
to
suffer
so
severely
that
he
may
even
succumb
to
the
suffering
and
when
the
blow
falls
he
feels
scarcely
any
pain
but
afterwards
when
he
has
come
to
himself
and
is
conscious
of
his
insensibility
he
is
seized
with
terror
a
tragic
terror
the
most
terrible
of
all
and
choking
with
anguish
he
cries
out
can
it
be
that
i
no
longer
exist
which
would
you
find
most
appalling
to
feel
such
a
pain
as
would
deprive
you
of
your
senses
on
being
pierced
through
with
a
iron
or
to
see
yourself
thus
pierced
through
without
feeling
any
pain
have
you
never
felt
the
horrible
terror
of
feeling
yourself
incapable
of
suffering
and
of
tears
suffering
tells
us
that
we
exist
suffering
tells
us
that
those
whom
we
love
exist
suffering
tells
us
that
the
world
in
which
we
live
exists
and
suffering
tells
us
that
god
exists
and
suffers
but
it
is
the
suffering
of
anguish
the
anguish
of
surviving
and
being
eternal
anguish
discovers
god
to
us
and
makes
us
love
him
to
believe
in
god
is
to
love
him
and
to
love
him
is
to
feel
him
suffering
to
pity
him
it
may
perhaps
appear
blasphemous
to
say
that
god
suffers
for
suffering
implies
limitation
nevertheless
god
the
consciousness
of
the
universe
is
limited
by
the
brute
matter
in
which
he
lives
by
the
unconscious
from
which
he
seeks
to
liberate
himself
and
to
liberate
us
and
we
in
our
turn
must
seek
to
liberate
him
god
suffers
in
each
and
all
of
us
in
each
and
all
of
the
consciousnesses
imprisoned
in
transitory
matter
and
we
all
suffer
in
him
religious
anguish
is
but
the
divine
suffering
the
feeling
that
god
suffers
in
me
and
that
i
suffer
in
him
the
universal
suffering
is
the
anguish
of
all
in
seeking
to
be
all
else
but
without
power
to
achieve
it
the
anguish
of
each
in
being
he
that
he
is
being
at
the
same
time
all
that
he
is
not
and
being
so
for
ever
the
essence
of
a
being
is
not
only
its
endeavour
to
persist
for
ever
as
spinoza
taught
us
but
also
its
endeavour
to
universalize
itself
it
is
the
hunger
and
thirst
for
eternity
and
infinity
every
created
being
tends
not
only
to
preserve
itself
in
itself
but
to
perpetuate
itself
and
moreover
to
invade
all
other
beings
to
be
others
without
ceasing
to
be
itself
to
extend
its
limits
to
the
infinite
but
without
breaking
them
it
does
not
wish
to
throw
down
its
walls
and
leave
everything
laid
flat
common
and
undefended
confounding
and
losing
its
own
individuality
but
it
wishes
to
carry
its
walls
to
the
extreme
limits
of
creation
and
to
embrace
everything
within
them
it
seeks
the
maximum
of
individuality
with
the
maximum
also
of
personality
it
aspires
to
the
identification
of
the
universe
with
itself
it
aspires
to
god
and
this
vast
i
within
which
each
individual
i
seeks
to
put
the
universe
what
is
it
but
god
and
because
i
aspire
to
god
i
love
him
and
this
aspiration
of
mine
towards
god
is
my
love
for
him
and
just
as
i
suffer
in
being
he
he
also
suffers
in
being
i
and
in
being
each
one
of
us
i
am
well
aware
that
in
spite
of
my
warning
that
i
am
attempting
here
to
give
a
logical
form
to
a
system
of
feelings
i
shall
be
scandalizing
not
a
few
of
my
readers
in
speaking
of
a
god
who
suffers
and
in
applying
to
god
himself
as
god
the
passion
of
christ
the
god
of
rational
theology
excludes
in
effect
all
suffering
and
the
reader
will
no
doubt
think
that
this
idea
of
suffering
can
have
only
a
metaphorical
value
when
applied
to
god
similar
to
that
which
is
supposed
to
attach
to
those
passages
in
the
old
testament
which
describe
the
human
passions
of
the
god
of
israel
for
anger
wrath
and
vengeance
are
impossible
without
suffering
and
as
for
saying
that
god
suffers
through
being
bound
by
matter
i
shall
be
told
that
in
the
words
of
plotinus
the
universal
soul
can
not
be
bound
by
the
very
thing
namely
bodies
or
matter
which
is
bound
by
it
herein
is
involved
the
whole
problem
of
the
origin
of
evil
the
evil
of
sin
no
less
than
the
evil
of
pain
for
if
god
does
not
suffer
he
causes
suffering
and
if
his
life
since
god
lives
is
not
a
process
of
realizing
in
himself
a
total
consciousness
which
is
continually
becoming
fuller
that
is
to
say
which
is
continually
becoming
more
and
more
god
it
is
a
process
of
drawing
all
things
towards
himself
of
imparting
himself
to
all
of
constraining
the
consciousness
of
each
part
to
enter
into
the
consciousness
of
the
all
which
is
he
himself
until
at
last
he
comes
to
be
all
in
all
en
according
to
the
expression
of
paul
the
first
christian
mystic
we
will
discuss
this
more
fully
however
in
the
next
chapter
on
the
apocatastasis
or
beatific
union
for
the
present
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
there
is
a
vast
current
of
suffering
urging
living
beings
towards
one
another
constraining
them
to
love
one
another
and
to
seek
one
another
and
to
endeavour
to
complete
one
another
and
to
be
each
himself
and
others
at
the
same
time
in
god
everything
lives
and
in
his
suffering
everything
suffers
and
in
loving
god
we
love
his
creatures
in
him
just
as
in
loving
and
pitying
his
creatures
we
love
and
pity
god
in
them
no
single
soul
can
be
free
so
long
as
there
is
anything
enslaved
in
god
world
neither
can
god
himself
who
lives
in
the
soul
of
each
one
of
us
be
free
so
long
as
our
soul
is
not
free
my
most
immediate
sensation
is
the
sense
and
love
of
my
own
misery
my
anguish
the
compassion
i
feel
for
myself
the
love
i
bear
for
myself
and
when
this
compassion
is
vital
and
superabundant
it
overflows
from
me
upon
others
and
from
the
excess
of
my
own
compassion
i
come
to
have
compassion
for
my
neighbours
my
own
misery
is
so
great
that
the
compassion
for
myself
which
it
awakens
within
me
soon
overflows
and
reveals
to
me
the
universal
misery
and
what
is
charity
but
the
overflow
of
pity
what
is
it
but
reflected
pity
that
overflows
and
pours
itself
out
in
a
flood
of
pity
for
the
woes
of
others
and
in
the
exercise
of
charity
when
the
overplus
of
our
pity
leads
us
to
the
consciousness
of
god
within
us
it
fills
us
with
so
great
anguish
for
the
misery
shed
abroad
in
all
things
that
we
have
to
pour
our
pity
abroad
and
this
we
do
in
the
form
of
charity
and
in
this
pouring
abroad
of
our
pity
we
experience
relief
and
the
painful
sweetness
of
goodness
this
is
what
teresa
de
jesús
the
mystical
doctor
called
suffering
and
she
knew
also
the
lore
of
suffering
loves
it
is
as
when
one
looks
upon
some
thing
of
beauty
and
feels
the
necessity
of
making
others
sharers
in
it
for
the
creative
impulse
in
which
charity
consists
is
the
work
of
suffering
love
we
feel
in
effect
a
satisfaction
in
doing
good
when
good
superabounds
within
us
when
we
are
swollen
with
pity
and
we
are
swollen
with
pity
when
god
filling
our
soul
gives
us
the
suffering
sensation
of
universal
life
of
the
universal
longing
for
eternal
divinization
for
we
are
not
merely
placed
side
by
side
with
others
in
the
world
having
no
common
root
with
them
neither
is
their
lot
indifferent
to
us
but
their
pain
hurts
us
their
anguish
fills
us
with
anguish
and
we
feel
our
community
of
origin
and
of
suffering
even
without
knowing
it
suffering
and
pity
which
is
born
of
suffering
are
what
reveal
to
us
the
brotherhood
of
every
existing
thing
that
possesses
life
and
more
or
less
of
consciousness
brother
wolf
francis
of
assisi
called
the
poor
wolf
that
feels
a
painful
hunger
for
the
sheep
and
feels
too
perhaps
the
pain
of
having
to
devour
them
and
this
brotherhood
reveals
to
us
the
fatherhood
of
god
reveals
to
us
that
god
is
a
father
and
that
he
exists
and
as
a
father
he
shelters
our
common
misery
charity
then
is
the
impulse
to
liberate
myself
and
all
my
fellows
from
suffering
and
to
liberate
god
who
embraces
us
all
suffering
is
a
spiritual
thing
it
is
the
most
immediate
revelation
of
consciousness
and
it
may
be
that
our
body
was
given
us
simply
in
order
that
suffering
might
be
enabled
to
manifest
itself
a
man
who
had
never
known
suffering
either
in
greater
or
less
degree
would
scarcely
possess
consciousness
of
himself
the
child
first
cries
at
birth
when
the
air
entering
into
his
lungs
and
limiting
him
seems
to
say
to
him
you
have
to
breathe
me
in
order
that
you
may
live
we
must
needs
believe
with
faith
whatever
counsels
reason
may
give
us
that
the
material
or
sensible
world
which
the
senses
create
for
us
exists
solely
in
order
to
embody
and
sustain
that
other
spiritual
or
imaginable
world
which
the
imagination
creates
for
us
consciousness
tends
to
be
ever
more
and
more
consciousness
to
intensify
its
consciousness
to
acquire
full
consciousness
of
its
complete
self
of
the
whole
of
its
content
we
must
needs
believe
with
faith
whatever
counsels
reason
may
give
us
that
in
the
depths
of
our
own
bodies
in
animals
in
plants
in
rocks
in
everything
that
lives
in
all
the
universe
there
is
a
spirit
that
strives
to
know
itself
to
acquire
consciousness
of
itself
to
be
itself
for
to
be
oneself
is
to
know
oneself
to
be
pure
spirit
and
since
it
can
only
achieve
this
by
means
of
the
body
by
means
of
matter
it
creates
and
makes
use
of
matter
at
the
same
time
that
it
remains
the
prisoner
of
it
the
face
can
only
see
itself
when
portrayed
in
the
mirror
but
in
order
to
see
itself
it
must
remain
the
prisoner
of
the
mirror
in
which
it
sees
itself
and
the
image
which
it
sees
therein
is
as
the
mirror
distorts
it
and
if
the
mirror
breaks
the
image
is
broken
and
if
the
mirror
is
blurred
the
image
is
blurred
spirit
finds
itself
limited
by
the
matter
in
which
it
has
to
live
and
acquire
consciousness
of
itself
just
as
thought
is
limited
by
the
word
in
which
as
a
social
medium
it
is
incarnated
without
matter
there
is
no
spirit
but
matter
makes
spirit
suffer
by
limiting
it
and
suffering
is
simply
the
obstacle
which
matter
opposes
to
spirit
it
is
the
clash
of
the
conscious
with
the
unconscious
suffering
is
in
effect
the
barrier
which
unconsciousness
matter
sets
up
against
consciousness
spirit
it
is
the
resistance
to
will
the
limit
which
the
visible
universe
imposes
upon
god
it
is
the
wall
that
consciousness
runs
up
against
when
it
seeks
to
extend
itself
at
the
expense
of
unconsciousness
it
is
the
resistance
which
unconsciousness
opposes
to
its
penetration
by
consciousness
although
in
deference
to
authority
we
may
believe
we
do
not
in
fact
know
that
we
possess
heart
stomach
or
lungs
so
long
as
they
do
not
cause
us
discomfort
suffering
or
anguish
physical
suffering
or
even
discomfort
is
what
reveals
to
us
our
own
internal
core
and
the
same
is
true
of
spiritual
suffering
and
anguish
for
we
do
not
take
account
of
the
fact
that
we
possess
a
soul
until
it
hurts
us
anguish
is
that
which
makes
consciousness
return
upon
itself
he
who
knows
no
anguish
knows
what
he
does
and
what
he
thinks
but
he
does
not
truly
know
that
he
does
it
and
that
he
thinks
it
he
thinks
but
he
does
not
think
that
he
thinks
and
his
thoughts
are
as
if
they
were
not
his
neither
does
he
properly
belong
to
himself
for
it
is
only
anguish
it
is
only
the
passionate
longing
never
to
die
that
makes
a
human
spirit
master
of
itself
pain
which
is
a
kind
of
dissolution
makes
us
discover
our
internal
core
and
in
the
supreme
dissolution
which
is
death
we
shall
at
last
through
the
pain
of
annihilation
arrive
at
the
core
of
our
temporal
core
at
god
whom
in
our
spiritual
anguish
we
breathe
and
learn
to
love
even
so
must
we
believe
with
faith
whatever
counsels
reason
may
give
us
the
origin
of
evil
as
many
discovered
of
old
is
nothing
other
than
what
is
called
by
another
name
the
inertia
of
matter
and
as
applied
to
the
things
of
the
spirit
sloth
and
not
without
truth
has
it
been
said
that
sloth
is
the
mother
of
all
vices
not
forgetting
that
the
supreme
sloth
is
that
of
not
longing
madly
for
immortality
consciousness
the
craving
for
more
more
always
more
hunger
of
eternity
and
thirst
of
infinity
appetite
for
god
these
are
never
satisfied
each
consciousness
seeks
to
be
itself
and
to
be
all
other
consciousnesses
without
ceasing
to
be
itself
it
seeks
to
be
god
and
matter
unconsciousness
tends
to
be
less
and
less
tends
to
be
nothing
its
thirst
being
a
thirst
for
repose
spirit
says
i
wish
to
be
and
matter
answers
i
wish
not
to
be
and
in
the
order
of
human
life
the
individual
would
tend
under
the
sole
instigation
of
the
instinct
of
preservation
the
creator
of
the
material
world
to
destruction
to
annihilation
if
it
were
not
for
society
which
in
implanting
in
him
the
instinct
of
perpetuation
the
creator
of
the
spiritual
world
lifts
and
impels
him
towards
the
all
towards
immortalization
and
everything
that
man
does
as
a
mere
individual
opposed
to
society
for
the
sake
of
his
own
preservation
and
at
the
expense
of
society
if
need
be
is
bad
and
everything
that
he
does
as
a
social
person
for
the
sake
of
the
society
in
which
he
himself
is
included
for
the
sake
of
its
perpetuation
and
of
the
perpetuation
of
himself
in
it
is
good
and
many
of
those
who
seem
to
be
the
greatest
egoists
trampling
everything
under
their
feet
in
their
zeal
to
bring
their
work
to
a
successful
issue
are
in
reality
men
whose
souls
are
aflame
and
overflowing
with
charity
for
they
subject
and
subordinate
their
petty
personal
i
to
the
social
i
that
has
a
mission
to
accomplish
he
who
would
tie
the
working
of
love
of
spiritualization
of
liberation
to
transitory
and
individual
forms
crucifies
god
in
matter
he
crucifies
god
who
makes
the
ideal
subservient
to
his
own
temporal
interests
or
worldly
glory
and
such
a
one
is
a
deicide
the
work
of
charity
of
the
love
of
god
is
to
endeavour
to
liberate
god
from
brute
matter
to
endeavour
to
give
consciousness
to
everything
to
spiritualize
or
universalize
everything
it
is
to
dream
that
the
very
rocks
may
find
a
voice
and
work
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
this
dream
it
is
to
dream
that
everything
that
exists
may
become
conscious
that
the
word
may
become
life
we
have
but
to
look
at
the
eucharistic
symbol
to
see
an
instance
of
it
the
word
has
been
imprisoned
in
a
piece
of
material
bread
and
it
has
been
imprisoned
therein
to
the
end
that
we
may
eat
it
and
in
eating
it
make
it
our
own
part
and
parcel
of
our
body
in
which
the
spirit
dwells
and
that
it
may
beat
in
our
heart
and
think
in
our
brain
and
be
consciousness
it
has
been
imprisoned
in
this
bread
in
order
that
after
being
buried
in
our
body
it
may
come
to
life
again
in
our
spirit
and
we
must
spiritualize
everything
and
this
we
shall
accomplish
by
giving
our
spirit
which
grows
the
more
the
more
it
is
distributed
to
all
men
and
to
all
things
and
we
give
our
spirit
when
we
invade
other
spirits
and
make
ourselves
the
master
of
them
all
this
is
to
be
believed
with
faith
whatever
counsels
reason
may
give
us
and
now
we
are
about
to
see
what
practical
consequences
all
these
more
or
less
fantastical
doctrines
may
have
in
regard
to
logic
to
esthetics
and
above
all
to
ethics
their
religious
concretion
in
a
word
and
perhaps
then
they
will
gain
more
justification
in
the
eyes
of
the
reader
who
in
spite
of
my
warnings
has
hitherto
been
looking
for
the
scientific
or
even
philosophic
development
of
an
irrational
system
i
think
it
may
not
be
superfluous
to
recall
to
the
reader
once
again
what
i
said
at
the
conclusion
of
the
sixth
chapter
that
entitled
in
the
depths
of
the
abyss
but
we
now
approach
the
practical
or
pragmatical
part
of
this
treatise
first
however
we
must
see
how
the
religious
sense
may
become
concrete
in
the
hopeful
vision
of
another
life

teresa
said
and
miguel
de

repeated
with
a
harsher
and
more
despairing
inflection
that
the
soul
must
realize
that
nothing
exists
but
itself
and
god
and
this
relation
with
god
this
more
or
less
intimate
union
with
him
is
what
we
call
religion
what
is
religion
in
what
does
it
differ
from
the
religious
sense
and
how
are
the
two
related
every
man
definition
of
religion
is
based
upon
his
own
inward
experience
of
it
rather
than
upon
his
observation
of
it
in
others
nor
indeed
is
it
possible
to
define
it
without
in
some
way
or
another
experiencing
it
tacitus
said
speaking
of
the
jews
that
they
regarded
as
profane
everything
that
the
romans
held
to
be
sacred
and
that
what
was
sacred
to
them
was
to
the
romans
impure
illic
omnia
quæ
apud
nos
sacra
rursum
conversa
apud
illos
quæ
nobis
therefore
he
the
roman
describes
the
jews
as
a
people
dominated
by
superstition
and
hostile
to
religion
superstitioni
obnoxia
religionibus
while
as
regards
christianity
with
which
he
was
very
imperfectly
acquainted
scarcely
distinguishing
it
from
judaism
he
deemed
it
to
be
a
pernicious
superstition
inspired
by
a
hatred
of
mankind
generis
excessu
and
there
have
been
many
others
who
have
shared
his
opinion
but
where
does
religion
end
and
superstition
begin
or
perhaps
rather
we
should
say
at
what
point
does
superstition
merge
into
religion
what
is
the
criterion
by
means
of
which
we
discriminate
between
them
it
would
be
of
little
profit
to
recapitulate
here
even
summarily
the
principal
definitions
each
bearing
the
impress
of
the
personal
feeling
of
its
definer
which
have
been
given
of
religion
religion
is
better
described
than
defined
and
better
felt
than
described
but
if
there
is
any
one
definition
that
latterly
has
obtained
acceptance
it
is
that
of
schleiermacher
to
the
effect
that
religion
consists
in
the
simple
feeling
of
a
relationship
of
dependence
upon
something
above
us
and
a
desire
to
establish
relations
with
this
mysterious
power
nor
is
there
much
amiss
with
the
statement
of
hermann
that
the
religious
longing
of
man
is
a
desire
for
truth
concerning
his
human
existence
and
to
cut
short
these
extraneous
citations
i
will
end
with
one
from
the
judicious
and
perspicacious
cournot
religious
manifestations
are
the
necessary
consequence
of
man
predisposition
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
an
invisible
supernatural
and
miraculous
world
a
predisposition
which
it
has
been
possible
to
consider
sometimes
as
a
reminiscence
of
an
anterior
state
sometimes
as
an
intimation
of
a
future
destiny
de
des
idées
fondamentales
dans
les
sciences
et
dans
and
it
is
this
problem
of
human
destiny
of
eternal
life
or
of
the
human
finality
of
the
universe
or
of
god
that
we
have
now
reached
all
the
highways
of
religion
lead
up
to
this
for
it
is
the
very
essence
of
all
religion
beginning
with
the
savage
personalization
of
the
whole
universe
in
his
fetich
religion
has
its
roots
in
the
vital
necessity
of
giving
human
finality
to
the
universe
to
god
and
this
necessity
obliges
it
therefore
to
attribute
to
the
universe
to
god
consciousness
of
self
and
of
purpose
and
it
may
be
said
that
religion
is
simply
union
with
god
each
one
interpreting
god
according
to
his
own
sense
of
him
god
gives
transcendent
meaning
and
finality
to
life
but
he
gives
it
relatively
to
each
one
of
us
who
believe
in
him
and
thus
god
is
for
man
as
much
as
man
is
for
god
for
god
in
becoming
man
in
becoming
human
has
given
himself
to
man
because
of
his
love
of
him
and
this
religious
longing
for
union
with
god
is
a
longing
for
a
union
that
can
not
be
consummated
in
science
or
in
art
but
only
in
life
he
who
possesses
science
and
art
has
religion
he
who
possesses
neither
science
nor
art
let
him
get
religion
said
goethe
in
one
of
his
frequent
accesses
of
paganism
and
yet
in
spite
of
what
he
said
he
himself
goethe
and
to
wish
that
we
may
be
united
with
god
is
not
to
wish
that
we
may
be
lost
and
submerged
in
him
for
this
loss
and
submersion
of
self
ends
at
last
in
the
complete
dissolution
of
self
in
the
dreamless
sleep
of
nirvana
it
is
to
wish
to
possess
him
rather
than
to
be
possessed
by
him
when
his
disciples
amazed
at
his
saying
that
it
was
impossible
for
a
rich
man
to
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
asked
jesus
who
then
could
be
saved
the
master
replied
that
with
men
it
was
impossible
but
not
with
god
and
then
said
peter
behold
we
have
forsaken
all
and
followed
thee
what
shall
we
have
therefore
and
the
reply
of
jesus
was
not
that
they
should
be
absorbed
in
the
father
but
that
they
should
sit
upon
twelve
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
of
israel
matt
xix
it
was
a
spaniard
and
very
emphatically
a
spaniard
miguel
de
molinos
who
said
in
his
that
he
who
would
attain
to
the
mystical
science
must
abandon
and
be
detached
from
five
things
first
from
creatures
second
from
temporal
things
third
from
the
very
gifts
of
the
holy
spirit
fourth
from
himself
and
fifth
he
must
be
detached
even
from
god
and
he
adds
that
this
last
is
the
completest
of
all
because
that
soul
only
that
knows
how
to
be
so
detached
is
that
which
attains
to
being
lost
in
god
and
only
the
soul
that
attains
to
being
so
lost
succeeds
in
finding
itself
emphatically
a
true
spaniard
molinos
and
truly
spanish
is
this
paradoxical
expression
of
quietism
or
rather
of
nihilism
for
he
himself
elsewhere
speaks
of
annihilation
and
not
less
spanish
nay
perhaps
even
more
spanish
were
the
jesuits
who
attacked
him
upholding
the
prerogatives
of
the
all
against
the
claims
of
nothingness
for
religion
is
not
the
longing
for
but
for
it
is
the
longing
not
for
death
but
for
life
the
eternal
religion
of
the
inward
essence
of
man
the
individual
dream
of
the
heart
is
the
worship
of
his
own
being
the
adoration
of
life
as
the
tortured
soul
of
flaubert
was
intimately
aware
les
champs
et
par
les
when
at
the
beginning
of
the
modern
age
at
the
renaissance
the
pagan
sense
of
religion
came
to
life
again
it
took
concrete
form
in
the
knightly
ideal
with
its
codes
of
love
and
honour
but
it
was
a
paganism
christianized
baptized
woman
was
the
divinity
enshrined
within
those
savage
breasts
whosoever
will
investigate
the
memorials
of
primitive
times
will
find
this
ideal
of
woman
in
its
full
force
and
purity
the
universe
is
woman
and
so
it
was
in
germany
in
france
in
provence
in
spain
in
italy
at
the
beginning
of
the
modern
age
history
was
cast
in
this
mould
trojans
and
romans
were
conceived
as
and
so
too
were
arabs
saracens
turks
the
sultan
and
saladin
in
this
universal
fraternity
mingle
angels
saints
miracles
and
paradise
strangely
blended
with
the
fantasy
and
voluptuousness
of
the
oriental
world
and
all
baptized
in
the
name
of
chivalry
thus
in
his
della
letteratura
writes
francesco
de
sanctis
and
in
an
earlier
passage
he
informs
us
that
for
that
breed
of
men
in
paradise
itself
the
lover
delight
was
to
look
upon
his
lady
and
that
he
had
no
desire
to
go
thither
if
he
might
not
go
in
his
lady
company
what
in
fact
was
chivalry
which
cervantes
intending
to
kill
it
afterwards
purified
and
christianized
in
but
a
real
though
distorted
religion
a
hybrid
between
paganism
and
christianity
whose
gospel
perhaps
was
the
legend
of
tristan
and
iseult
and
did
not
even
the
christianity
of
the
mystics
those
of
the
spirit
possibly
reach
its
in
the
worship
of
the
divine
woman
the
virgin
mary
what
else
was
the
mariolatry
of
a
bonaventura
the
troubadour
of
mary
and
this
sentiment
found
its
inspiration
in
love
of
the
fountain
of
life
of
that
which
saves
us
from
death
but
as
the
renaissance
advanced
men
turned
from
the
religion
of
woman
to
the
religion
of
science
desire
the
foundation
of
which
was
curiosity
ended
in
curiosity
in
eagerness
to
taste
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
good
and
evil
europe
flocked
to
the
university
of
bologna
in
search
of
learning
chivalry
was
succeeded
by
platonism
men
sought
to
discover
the
mystery
of
the
world
and
of
life
but
it
was
really
in
order
to
save
life
which
they
had
also
sought
to
save
in
the
worship
of
woman
human
consciousness
sought
to
penetrate
the
universal
consciousness
but
its
real
object
whether
it
was
aware
of
it
or
not
was
to
save
itself
for
the
truth
is
that
we
feel
and
imagine
the
universal
consciousness
and
in
this
feeling
and
imagination
religious
experience
consists
simply
in
order
that
thereby
we
may
save
our
own
individual
consciousnesses
and
how
once
again
i
must
repeat
that
the
longing
for
the
immortality
of
the
soul
for
the
permanence
in
some
form
or
another
of
our
personal
and
individual
consciousness
is
as
much
of
the
essence
of
religion
as
is
the
longing
that
there
may
be
a
god
the
one
does
not
exist
apart
from
the
other
the
reason
being
that
fundamentally
they
are
one
and
the
same
thing
but
as
soon
as
we
attempt
to
give
a
concrete
and
rational
form
to
this
longing
for
immortality
and
permanence
to
define
it
to
ourselves
we
encounter
even
more
difficulties
than
we
encountered
in
our
attempt
to
rationalize
god
the
universal
consent
of
mankind
has
again
been
invoked
as
a
means
of
justifying
this
immortal
longing
for
immortality
to
our
own
feeble
reason
animos
arbitratur
consensu
nationum
said
cicero
echoing
the
opinion
of
the
ancients
but
this
same
recorder
of
his
own
feelings
confessed
that
although
when
he
read
the
arguments
in
favour
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
in
the
of
plato
he
was
compelled
to
assent
to
them
as
soon
as
he
put
the
book
aside
and
began
to
revolve
the
problem
in
his
own
mind
all
his
previous
assent
melted
away
omnis
illa
cap
and
what
happened
to
cicero
happens
to
us
all
and
it
happened
likewise
to
swedenborg
the
most
daring
visionary
of
the
other
world
swedenborg
admitted
that
he
who
discourses
of
life
after
death
putting
aside
all
erudite
notions
concerning
the
soul
and
its
mode
of
union
with
the
body
believes
that
after
death
he
shall
live
in
a
glorious
joy
and
vision
as
a
man
among
angels
but
when
he
begins
to
reflect
upon
the
doctrine
of
the
union
of
the
soul
with
the
body
or
upon
the
hypothetical
opinion
concerning
the
soul
doubts
arise
in
him
as
to
whether
the
soul
is
thus
or
otherwise
and
when
these
doubts
arise
his
former
idea
is
dissipated
cælo
et
nevertheless
as
cournot
says
it
is
the
destiny
that
awaits
me
or
my
that
moves
perturbs
and
consoles
me
that
makes
me
capable
of
abnegation
and
sacrifice
whatever
be
the
origin
the
nature
or
the
essence
of
this
inexplicable
bond
of
union
in
the
absence
of
which
the
philosophers
are
pleased
to
determine
that
my
person
must
disappear
must
we
then
embrace
the
pure
and
naked
faith
in
an
eternal
life
without
trying
to
represent
it
to
ourselves
this
is
impossible
it
is
beyond
our
power
to
bring
ourselves
or
accustom
ourselves
to
do
so
and
nevertheless
there
are
some
who
call
themselves
christians
and
yet
leave
almost
altogether
on
one
side
this
question
of
representation
take
any
work
of
theology
informed
by
the
most
enlightened
that
is
the
most
rationalistic
and
liberal
protestantism
take
for
instance
the
of
julius
kaftan
and
of
the
pages
of
which
the
sixth
edition
that
of
consists
you
will
find
only
one
the
last
that
is
devoted
to
this
problem
and
in
this
page
after
affirming
that
christ
is
not
only
the
beginning
and
middle
but
also
the
end
and
consummation
of
history
and
that
those
who
are
in
christ
will
attain
to
fullness
of
life
the
eternal
life
of
those
who
are
in
christ
not
a
single
word
as
to
what
that
life
may
be
half
a
dozen
words
at
most
about
eternal
death
that
is
hell
for
its
existence
is
demanded
by
the
moral
character
of
faith
and
of
christian
hope
its
moral
character
eh
not
its
religious
character
for
i
am
not
aware
that
the
latter
knows
any
such
exigency
and
all
this
inspired
by
a
prudent
agnostic
parsimony
yes
the
prudent
the
rational
and
some
will
say
the
pious
attitude
is
not
to
seek
to
penetrate
into
mysteries
that
are
hidden
from
our
knowledge
not
to
insist
upon
shaping
a
plastic
representation
of
eternal
glory
such
as
that
of
the
true
faith
true
christian
piety
we
shall
be
told
consists
in
resting
upon
the
confidence
that
god
by
the
grace
of
christ
will
in
some
way
or
another
make
us
live
in
him
in
his
son
that
as
our
destiny
is
in
his
almighty
hands
we
should
surrender
ourselves
to
him
in
the
full
assurance
that
he
will
do
with
us
what
is
best
for
the
ultimate
end
of
life
of
spirit
and
of
the
universe
such
is
the
teaching
that
has
traversed
many
centuries
and
was
notably
prominent
in
the
period
between
luther
and
kant
and
nevertheless
men
have
not
ceased
endeavouring
to
imagine
to
themselves
what
this
eternal
life
may
be
nor
will
they
cease
their
endeavours
so
long
as
they
are
men
and
not
merely
thinking
machines
there
are
books
of
theology
or
of
what
passes
for
theology
full
of
disquisitions
upon
the
conditions
under
which
the
blessed
dead
live
in
paradise
upon
their
mode
of
enjoyment
upon
the
properties
of
the
glorious
body
for
without
some
form
of
body
the
soul
can
not
be
conceived
and
to
this
same
necessity
the
real
necessity
of
forming
to
ourselves
a
concrete
representation
of
what
this
other
life
may
be
must
in
great
part
be
referred
the
indestructible
vitality
of
doctrines
such
as
those
of
spiritualism
metempsychosis
the
transmigration
of
souls
from
star
to
star
and
the
like
doctrines
which
as
often
as
they
are
pronounced
to
be
defeated
and
dead
are
found
to
have
come
to
life
again
clothed
in
some
more
or
less
new
form
and
it
is
merely
supine
to
be
content
to
ignore
them
and
not
to
seek
to
discover
their
permanent
and
living
essence
man
will
never
willingly
abandon
his
attempt
to
form
a
concrete
representation
of
the
other
life
but
is
an
eternal
and
endless
life
after
death
indeed
thinkable
how
can
we
conceive
the
life
of
a
disembodied
spirit
how
can
we
conceive
such
a
spirit
how
can
we
conceive
a
pure
consciousness
without
a
corporal
organism
descartes
divided
the
world
into
thought
and
extension
a
dualism
which
was
imposed
upon
him
by
the
christian
dogma
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
but
is
extension
is
matter
that
which
thinks
and
is
spiritualized
or
is
thought
that
which
is
extended
and
materialized
the
weightiest
questions
of
metaphysics
arise
practically
out
of
our
desire
to
arrive
at
an
understanding
of
the
possibility
of
our
immortality
from
this
fact
they
derive
their
value
and
cease
to
be
merely
the
idle
discussions
of
fruitless
curiosity
for
the
truth
is
that
metaphysics
has
no
value
save
in
so
far
as
it
attempts
to
explain
in
what
way
our
vital
longing
can
or
can
not
be
realized
and
thus
it
is
that
there
is
and
always
will
be
a
rational
metaphysic
and
a
vital
metaphysic
in
perennial
conflict
with
one
another
the
one
setting
out
from
the
notion
of
cause
the
other
from
the
notion
of
substance
and
even
if
we
were
to
succeed
in
imagining
personal
immortality
might
we
not
possibly
feel
it
to
be
something
no
less
terrible
than
its
negation
calypso
was
inconsolable
at
the
departure
of
ulysses
in
her
sorrow
she
was
dismayed
at
being
immortal
said
the
gentle
the
mystical
fénelon
at
the
beginning
of
his
was
it
not
a
kind
of
doom
that
the
ancient
gods
no
less
than
the
demons
were
subject
to
the
deprivation
of
the
power
to
commit
suicide
when
jesus
took
peter
and
james
and
john
up
into
a
high
mountain
and
was
transfigured
before
them
his
raiment
shining
as
white
as
snow
and
moses
and
elias
appeared
and
talked
with
him
peter
said
to
the
master
master
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
here
and
let
us
make
three
tabernacles
one
for
thee
and
one
for
moses
and
one
for
elias
for
he
wished
to
eternalize
that
moment
and
as
they
came
down
from
the
mountain
jesus
charged
them
that
they
should
tell
no
man
what
they
had
seen
until
the
son
of
man
should
have
risen
from
the
dead
and
they
keeping
this
saying
to
themselves
questioned
one
with
another
what
this
rising
from
the
dead
should
mean
as
men
not
understanding
the
purport
of
it
and
it
was
after
this
that
jesus
met
the
father
whose
son
was
possessed
with
a
dumb
spirit
and
who
cried
out
to
him
lord
i
believe
help
thou
mine
unbelief
mark
those
three
apostles
did
not
understand
what
this
rising
from
the
dead
meant
neither
did
those
sadducees
who
asked
the
master
whose
wife
she
should
be
in
the
resurrection
who
in
this
life
had
had
seven
husbands
matt
xxii
and
it
was
then
that
jesus
said
that
god
is
not
the
god
of
the
dead
but
of
the
living
and
the
other
life
is
not
in
fact
thinkable
to
us
except
under
the
same
forms
as
those
of
this
earthly
and
transitory
life
nor
is
the
mystery
at
all
clarified
by
that
metaphor
of
the
grain
and
the
wheat
that
it
bears
with
which
paul
answers
the
question
how
are
the
dead
raised
up
and
with
what
body
do
they
come
cor
xv
how
can
a
human
soul
live
and
enjoy
god
eternally
without
losing
its
individual
personality
that
is
to
say
without
losing
itself
what
is
it
to
enjoy
god
what
is
eternity
as
opposed
to
time
does
the
soul
change
or
does
it
not
change
in
the
other
life
if
it
does
not
change
how
does
it
live
and
if
it
changes
how
does
it
preserve
its
individuality
through
so
vast
a
period
of
time
for
though
the
other
life
may
exclude
space
it
can
not
exclude
time
as
cournot
observes
in
the
work
quoted
above
if
there
is
life
in
heaven
there
is
change
swedenborg
remarked
that
the
angels
change
because
the
delight
of
the
celestial
life
would
gradually
lose
its
value
if
they
always
enjoyed
it
in
its
fullness
and
because
angels
like
men
love
themselves
and
he
who
loves
himself
experiences
changes
of
state
and
he
adds
further
that
at
times
the
angels
are
sad
and
that
he
swedenborg
discoursed
with
some
when
they
were
sad
cælo
et
in
any
case
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
conceive
life
without
change
change
of
growth
or
of
diminution
of
sadness
or
of
joy
of
love
or
of
hate
in
effect
an
eternal
life
is
unthinkable
and
an
eternal
life
of
absolute
felicity
of
beatific
vision
is
more
unthinkable
still
and
what
precisely
is
this
beatific
vision
we
observe
in
the
first
place
that
it
is
called
vision
and
not
action
something
passive
being
therefore
presupposed
and
does
not
this
beatific
vision
suppose
loss
of
personal
consciousness
a
saint
in
heaven
says
bossuet
is
a
being
who
is
scarcely
sensible
of
himself
so
completely
is
he
possessed
by
god
and
immerged
in
his
glory
our
attention
can
not
stay
on
the
saint
because
one
finds
him
outside
of
himself
and
subject
by
an
unchangeable
love
to
the
source
of
his
being
and
his
happiness
culte
qui
est
dû
à
and
these
are
the
words
of
bossuet
the
antiquietist
this
loving
vision
of
god
supposes
an
absorption
in
him
he
who
in
a
state
of
blessedness
enjoys
god
in
his
fullness
must
perforce
neither
think
of
himself
nor
remember
himself
nor
have
any
consciousness
of
himself
but
be
in
perpetual
ecstasy
outside
of
himself
in
a
condition
of
alienation
and
the
ecstasy
that
the
mystics
describe
is
a
prelude
of
this
vision
he
who
sees
god
shall
die
say
the
scriptures
judg
xiii
and
may
it
not
be
that
the
eternal
vision
of
god
is
an
eternal
death
a
swooning
away
of
the
personality
but
teresa
in
her
description
of
the
last
state
of
prayer
the
rapture
transport
flight
or
ecstasy
of
the
soul
tells
us
that
the
soul
is
borne
as
upon
a
cloud
or
a
mighty
eagle
but
you
see
yourself
carried
away
and
know
not
whither
and
it
is
with
delight
and
if
you
do
not
resist
the
senses
are
not
lost
at
least
i
was
so
much
myself
as
to
be
able
to
perceive
that
i
was
being
lifted
up
that
is
to
say
without
losing
consciousness
and
god
appears
to
be
not
content
with
thus
attracting
the
soul
to
himself
in
so
real
a
way
but
wishes
to
have
the
body
also
though
it
be
mortal
and
of
earth
so
foul
ofttimes
the
soul
is
absorbed
or
to
speak
more
correctly
the
lord
absorbs
it
in
himself
and
when
he
has
held
it
thus
for
a
moment
the
will
alone
remains
in
union
with
him
not
the
intelligence
alone
we
see
therefore
that
it
is
not
so
much
vision
as
a
union
of
the
will
and
meanwhile
the
understanding
and
memory
are
distraught
like
one
who
has
slept
long
and
dreamed
and
is
hardly
yet
awake
it
is
a
soft
flight
a
delicious
flight
a
noiseless
flight
and
in
this
delicious
flight
the
consciousness
of
self
is
preserved
the
awareness
of
distinction
from
god
with
whom
one
is
united
and
one
is
raised
to
this
rapture
according
to
the
spanish
mystic
by
the
contemplation
of
the
humanity
of
christ
that
is
to
say
of
something
concrete
and
human
it
is
the
vision
of
the
living
god
not
of
the
idea
of
god
and
in
the
chapter
she
tells
us
that
though
there
were
nothing
else
to
delight
the
sight
in
heaven
but
the
great
beauty
of
the
glorified
bodies
that
would
be
an
excessive
bliss
particularly
the
vision
of
the
humanity
of
jesus
christ
our
lord
this
vision
she
continues
though
imaginary
i
did
never
see
with
my
bodily
eyes
nor
indeed
any
other
but
only
with
the
eyes
of
the
soul
and
thus
it
is
that
in
heaven
the
soul
does
not
see
god
only
but
everything
in
god
or
rather
it
sees
that
everything
is
god
for
god
embraces
all
things
and
this
idea
is
further
emphasized
by
jacob
böhme
the
saint
tells
us
in
the
vii
that
this
secret
union
takes
place
in
the
innermost
centre
of
the
soul
where
god
himself
must
dwell
and
she
goes
on
to
say
that
the
soul
i
mean
the
spirit
of
the
soul
is
made
one
with
god
and
this
union
may
be
likened
to
two
wax
candles
the
tips
of
which
touch
each
other
so
closely
that
there
is
but
one
light
or
again
the
wick
the
wax
and
the
light
become
one
but
the
one
candle
can
again
be
separated
from
the
other
and
the
two
candles
remain
distinct
or
the
wick
may
be
withdrawn
from
the
wax
but
there
is
another
more
intimate
union
and
this
is
like
rain
falling
from
heaven
into
a
river
or
stream
becoming
one
and
the
same
liquid
so
that
the
river
and
the
can
not
be
divided
or
it
resembles
a
streamlet
flowing
into
the
sea
which
can
not
afterwards
be
disunited
from
it
or
it
may
be
likened
to
a
room
into
which
a
bright
light
enters
through
two
windows
though
divided
when
it
enters
the
light
becomes
one
and
the
same
and
what
difference
is
there
between
this
and
the
internal
and
mystical
silence
of
miguel
de
molinos
the
third
and
most
perfect
degree
of
which
is
the
silence
of
thought
book
chap
do
we
not
here
very
closely
approach
the
view
that
nothingness
is
the
way
to
attain
to
that
high
state
of
a
mind
reformed
book
chap
and
what
marvel
is
it
that
amiel
in
his
should
twice
have
made
use
of
the
spanish
word
nothing
doubtless
because
he
found
none
more
expressive
in
any
other
language
and
nevertheless
if
we
read
our
mystical
doctor
teresa
with
care
we
shall
see
that
the
sensitive
element
is
never
excluded
the
element
of
delight
that
is
to
say
the
element
of
personal
consciousness
the
soul
allows
itself
to
be
absorbed
in
god
in
order
that
it
may
absorb
him
in
order
that
it
may
acquire
consciousness
of
its
own
divinity
a
beatific
vision
a
loving
contemplation
in
which
the
soul
is
absorbed
in
god
and
as
it
were
lost
in
him
appears
either
as
an
annihilation
of
self
or
as
a
prolonged
tedium
to
our
natural
way
of
feeling
and
hence
a
certain
feeling
which
we
not
infrequently
observe
and
which
has
more
than
once
expressed
itself
in
satires
not
altogether
free
from
irreverence
or
perhaps
impiety
with
reference
to
the
heaven
of
eternal
glory
as
a
place
of
eternal
boredom
and
it
is
useless
to
despise
feelings
such
as
these
so
wholly
natural
and
spontaneous
it
is
clear
that
those
who
feel
thus
have
failed
to
take
note
of
the
fact
that
man
highest
pleasure
consists
in
acquiring
and
intensifying
consciousness
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
exactly
but
rather
that
of
learning
in
knowing
a
thing
we
tend
to
forget
it
to
convert
it
if
the
expression
may
be
allowed
into
unconscious
knowledge
man
pleasure
his
purest
delight
is
allied
with
the
act
of
learning
of
getting
at
the
truth
of
things
of
acquiring
knowledge
with
differentiation
and
hence
the
famous
saying
of
lessing
which
i
have
already
quoted
there
is
a
story
told
of
an
ancient
spaniard
who
accompanied
vasco
núñez
de
balboa
when
he
climbed
that
peak
in
darien
from
which
both
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
are
visible
on
beholding
the
two
oceans
the
old
man
fell
on
his
knees
and
exclaimed
i
thank
thee
god
that
thou
didst
not
let
me
die
without
having
seen
so
great
a
wonder
but
if
this
man
had
stayed
there
very
soon
the
wonder
would
have
ceased
to
be
wonderful
and
with
the
wonder
the
pleasure
too
would
have
vanished
his
joy
was
the
joy
of
discovery
and
perhaps
the
joy
of
the
beatific
vision
may
be
not
exactly
that
of
the
contemplation
of
the
supreme
truth
whole
and
entire
for
this
the
soul
could
not
endure
but
rather
that
of
a
continual
discovery
of
the
truth
of
a
ceaseless
act
of
learning
involving
an
effort
which
keeps
the
sense
of
personal
consciousness
continually
active
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
conceive
a
beatific
vision
of
mental
quiet
of
full
knowledge
and
not
of
gradual
apprehension
as
in
any
way
different
from
a
kind
of
nirvana
a
spiritual
diffusion
a
dissipation
of
energy
in
the
essence
of
god
a
return
to
unconsciousness
induced
by
the
absence
of
shock
of
difference
in
a
word
of
activity
may
it
not
be
that
the
very
condition
which
makes
our
eternal
union
with
god
thinkable
destroys
our
longing
what
difference
is
there
between
being
absorbed
by
god
and
absorbing
him
in
ourself
is
it
the
stream
that
is
lost
in
the
sea
or
the
sea
that
is
lost
in
the
stream
it
is
all
the
same
our
fundamental
feeling
is
our
longing
not
to
lose
the
sense
of
the
continuity
of
our
consciousness
not
to
break
the
concatenation
of
our
memories
the
feeling
of
our
own
personal
concrete
identity
even
though
we
may
be
gradually
being
absorbed
in
god
enriching
him
who
at
eighty
years
of
age
remembers
the
child
that
he
was
at
eight
conscious
though
he
may
be
of
the
unbroken
chain
connecting
the
two
and
it
may
be
said
that
the
problem
for
feeling
resolves
itself
into
the
question
as
to
whether
there
is
a
god
whether
there
is
a
human
finality
to
the
universe
but
what
is
finality
for
just
as
it
is
always
possible
to
ask
the
why
of
every
why
so
it
is
also
always
possible
to
ask
the
wherefore
of
every
wherefore
supposing
that
there
is
a
god
then
wherefore
god
for
himself
it
will
be
said
and
someone
is
sure
to
reply
what
is
the
difference
between
this
consciousness
and
but
it
will
always
be
true
as
plotinus
has
said
that
to
ask
why
god
made
the
world
is
the
same
as
to
ask
why
there
is
a
soul
or
rather
not
why
but
wherefore
for
him
who
places
himself
outside
himself
in
an
objective
hypothetical
position
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
in
an
inhuman
position
the
ultimate
wherefore
is
as
inaccessible
and
strictly
as
absurd
as
the
ultimate
why
what
difference
in
effect
does
it
make
if
there
is
not
any
finality
what
logical
contradiction
is
involved
in
the
universe
not
being
destined
to
any
finality
either
human
or
superhuman
what
objection
is
there
in
reason
to
there
being
no
other
purpose
in
the
sum
of
things
save
only
to
exist
and
happen
as
it
does
exist
and
happen
for
him
who
places
himself
outside
himself
none
but
for
him
who
lives
and
suffers
and
desires
within
himself
for
him
it
is
a
question
of
life
or
death
seek
therefore
thyself
but
in
finding
oneself
does
not
one
find
one
own
nothingness
having
become
a
sinner
in
seeking
himself
man
has
become
wretched
in
finding
himself
said
bossuet

begins
with

xi
the
latest
gospel
in

is
know
thy

that
poor
of

tormented

thou
wilt
never
get

not
thy
business
this
of
knowing
thyself
thou
art
an
unknowable
individual
know
what
thou
canst
work
at
and
work
at
it
like
a
hercules
that
will
be
thy
better
plan
yes
but
what
i
work
at
will
not
that

be

if
it

should

yes
yes
it
may
be
that
to
accomplish
my
work
and
what
is
my
work
without
thinking
about
myself
is
to
love
god
and
what
is
it
to

on

in
loving

in

am
i
not
loving
myself
more
than

am
i
not
loving

in

what
we
really
long
for
after
death
is
to
go
on
living
this
life
this
same
mortal
life
but
without
its
ills
without
its
tedium
and
without
death
seneca
the
spaniard
gave
expression
to
this
in
his
ad
xxvi
what
he
desired
was
to
live
this
life
again
and
what
job
asked
for
xix
was
to
see
god
in
the
flesh
not
in
the
spirit
and
what
but
that
is
the
meaning
of
that
comic
conception
of
which
issued
from
the
tragic
soul
of
poor
nietzsche
hungering
for
concrete
and
temporal
immortality
and
this
beatific
vision
which
is
the
primary
catholic
solution
of
the
problem
how
can
it
be
realized
i
ask
again
without
obliteration
of
the
consciousness
of
self
will
it
not
be
like
a
sleep
in
which
we
dream
without
knowing
what
we
dream
who
would
wish
for
an
eternal
life
like
that
to
think
without
knowing
that
we
think
is
not
to
be
sensible
of
ourselves
it
is
not
to
be
ourselves
and
is
not
eternal
life
perhaps
eternal
consciousness
not
only
seeing
god
but
seeing
that
we
see
him
seeing
ourselves
at
the
same
time
and
ourselves
as
distinct
from
him
he
who
sleeps
lives
but
he
has
no
consciousness
of
himself
and
would
anyone
wish
for
an
eternal
sleep
when
circe
advised
ulysses
to
descend
to
the
abode
of
the
dead
in
order
to
consult
the
soothsayer
teiresias
she
told
him
that
teiresias
alone
among
the
shades
of
the
dead
was
possessed
of
understanding
for
all
the
others
flitted
about
like
shadows
and
can
it
be
said
that
the
others
apart
from
teiresias
had
really
overcome
death
is
it
to
overcome
death
to
flit
about
like
shadows
without
understanding
and
on
the
other
hand
may
we
not
imagine
that
possibly
this
earthly
life
of
ours
is
to
the
other
life
what
sleep
is
to
waking
may
not
all
our
life
be
a
dream
and
death
an
awakening
but
an
awakening
to
what
and
supposing
that
everything
is
but
the
dream
of
god
and
that
god
one
day
will
awaken
will
he
remember
his
dream
aristotle
the
rationalist
tells
in
his
of
the
superior
happiness
of
the
contemplative
life
and
all
rationalists
are
wont
to
place
happiness
in
knowledge
and
the
conception
of
eternal
happiness
of
the
enjoyment
of
god
as
a
beatific
vision
as
knowledge
and
comprehension
of
god
is
a
thing
of
rationalist
origin
it
is
the
kind
of
happiness
that
corresponds
with
the
of
aristotelianism
but
the
truth
is
that
in
addition
to
vision
happiness
demands
delight
and
this
is
a
thing
which
has
very
little
to
do
with
rationalism
and
is
only
attainable
when
we
feel
ourselves
distinct
from
god
our
aristotelian
catholic
theologian
the
author
of
the
endeavour
to
rationalize
catholic
feeling
thomas
aquinas
tells
us
in
his
secundæ
partis
i
that
delight
is
requisite
for
happiness
for
delight
is
caused
by
the
fact
of
desire
resting
in
attained
good
hence
since
happiness
is
nothing
but
the
attainment
of
the
sovereign
good
there
can
not
be
happiness
without
concomitant
delight
but
where
is
the
delight
of
him
who
rests
to
rest
is
not
that
to
sleep
and
not
to
possess
even
the
consciousness
that
one
is
resting
delight
is
caused
by
the
vision
of
god
itself
the
theologian
continues
but
does
the
soul
feel
itself
distinct
from
god
the
delight
that
accompanies
the
activity
of
the
understanding
does
not
impede
but
rather
strengthens
that
activity
he
says
later
on
obviously
for
what
happiness
were
it
else
and
in
order
to
save
delectation
delight
pleasure
which
like
pain
has
always
something
material
in
it
and
which
we
conceive
of
only
as
existing
in
a
soul
incarnate
in
a
body
it
was
necessary
to
suppose
that
the
soul
in
a
state
of
blessedness
is
united
with
its
body
apart
from
some
kind
of
body
how
is
delight
possible
the
immortality
of
the
pure
soul
without
some
sort
of
body
or
is
not
true
immortality
and
at
bottom
what
we
long
for
is
a
prolongation
of
this
life
this
life
and
no
other
this
life
of
flesh
and
suffering
this
life
which
we
imprecate
at
times
simply
because
it
comes
to
an
end
the
majority
of
suicides
would
not
take
their
lives
if
they
had
the
assurance
that
they
would
never
die
on
this
earth
the
kills
himself
because
he
will
not
wait
for
death
when
in
the
canto
of
the
dante
relates
how
he
attained
to
the
vision
of
god
he
tells
us
that
just
as
a
man
who
beholds
somewhat
in
his
sleep
retains
on
awakening
nothing
but
the
impression
of
the
feeling
in
his
mind
so
it
was
with
him
for
when
the
vision
had
all
but
passed
away
the
sweetness
that
sprang
from
it
still
distilled
itself
in
his
heart
son
to
che
quasi
tutta
cessa
mia
visione
ed
ancor
mi
distilla
nel
cuor
lo
dulce
che
nacque
da
like
snow
that
melts
in
the
sun
la
neve
al
sol
si
that
is
to
say
that
the
vision
the
intellectual
content
passes
and
that
which
remains
is
the
delight
the
the
emotional
the
irrational
in
a
word
the
corporeal
what
we
desire
is
not
merely
spiritual
felicity
not
merely
vision
but
delight
bodily
happiness
the
other
happiness
the
rationalist
the
happiness
of
being
submerged
in
understanding
can
only
i
will
not
say
satisfy
or
deceive
for
i
do
not
believe
that
it
ever
satisfied
or
deceived
even
a
spinoza
at
the
conclusion
of
his
in
propositions
xxxv
and
xxxvi
of
the
fifth
part
spinoza
affirms
that
god
loves
himself
with
an
infinite
intellectual
love
that
the
intellectual
love
of
the
mind
towards
god
is
the
selfsame
love
with
which
god
loves
himself
not
in
so
far
as
he
is
infinite
but
in
so
far
as
he
can
be
manifested
through
the
essence
of
the
human
mind
considered
under
the
form
of
eternity
that
is
to
say
that
the
intellectual
love
of
the
mind
towards
god
is
part
of
the
infinite
love
with
which
god
loves
himself
and
after
these
tragic
these
desolating
propositions
we
are
told
in
the
last
proposition
of
the
whole
book
that
which
closes
and
crowns
this
tremendous
tragedy
of
the
that
happiness
is
not
the
reward
of
virtue

and
that
our
repression
of
our
desires
is
not
the
cause
of
our
enjoyment

we
find

in
virtue

are

intellectual

intellectual
love
what
is
this
intellectual
love
something
of
the
nature
of
a
red
flavour
or
a
bitter
sound
or
an
aromatic
colour
or
rather
something
of
the
same
sort
as
a
triangle
or
an
enraged
ellipse
a
pure
metaphor
but
a
tragic
metaphor
and
a
metaphor
corresponding
tragically
with
that
saying
that
the
heart
also
has
its
reasons

tragedy
tragedy
tragedy
and
nevertheless
there
is
something
which
may
be
called
intellectual
love
and
that
is
the
love
of
understanding
that
which
aristotle
meant
by
the
contemplative
life
for
there
is
something
of
action
and
of
love
in
the
act
of
understanding
and
the
beatific
vision
is
the
vision
of
the
total
truth
is
there
not
perhaps
at
the
root
of
every
passion
something
of
curiosity
did
not
our
first
parents
according
to
the
biblical
story
fall
because
of
their
eagerness
to
taste
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
and
to
be
as
gods
knowers
of
this
knowledge
the
vision
of
god
that
is
to
say
the
vision
of
the
universe
itself
in
its
soul
in
its
inmost
essence
would
not
that
appease
all
our
longing
and
this
vision
can
fail
to
satisfy
only
men
of
a
gross
mind
who
do
not
perceive
that
the
greatest
joy
of
man
is
to
be
more
man
that
is
more
god
and
that
man
is
more
god
the
more
consciousness
he
has
and
this
intellectual
love
which
is
nothing
but
the
platonic
love
is
a
means
to
dominion
and
possession
there
is
in
fact
no
more
perfect
dominion
than
knowledge
he
who
knows
something
possesses
it
knowledge
unites
the
knower
with
the
known
i
contemplate
thee
and
in
contemplating
thee
i
make
thee
mine
such
is
the
formula
and
to
know
god
what
can
that
be
but
to
possess
him
he
who
knows
god
is
thereby

chap
brunhes
relates
a
story
concerning
the
great
catholic
mathematician
cauchy
communicated
to
him
by
sarrau
who
had
it
from
père
gratry
while
cauchy
and
père
gratry
were
walking
in
the
gardens
of
the
luxumbourg
their
conversation
turned
upon
the
happiness
which
those
in
heaven
would
have
in
knowing
at
last
without
any
obscurity
or
limitation
the
truths
which
they
had
so
long
and
so
laboriously
sought
to
investigate
on
earth
in
allusion
to
the
study
which
cauchy
had
made
of
the
mechanistic
theory
of
the
reflection
of
light
père
gratry
threw
out
the
suggestion
that
one
on
the
greatest
intellectual
joys
of
the
great
geometrician
in
the
future
life
would
be
to
penetrate
into
the
secret
of
light
to
which
cauchy
replied
that
it
did
not
appear
to
him
to
be
possible
to
know
more
about
this
than
he
himself
already
knew
neither
could
he
conceive
how
the
most
perfect
intelligence
could
arrive
at
a
clearer
comprehension
of
the
mystery
of
reflection
than
that
manifested
in
his
own
explanation
of
it
seeing
that
he
had
furnished
a
mechanistic
theory
of
the
phenomenon
his
piety
brunhes
adds
did
not
extend
to
a
belief
that
god
himself
could
have
created
anything
different
or
anything
better
from
this
narrative
two
points
of
interest
emerge
the
first
is
the
idea
expressed
in
it
as
to
what
contemplation
intellectual
love
or
beatific
vision
may
mean
for
men
of
a
superior
order
of
intelligence
men
whose
ruling
passion
is
knowledge
and
the
second
is
the
implicit
faith
shown
in
the
mechanistic
explanation
of
the
world
this
mechanistic
tendency
of
the
intellect
coheres
with
the
formula
nothing
is
created
nothing
is
lost
everything
is
transformed
a
formula
by
means
of
which
it
has
been
sought
to
interpret
the
ambiguous
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
forgetting
that
practically
for
us
for
men
energy
is
utilizable
energy
and
that
this
is
continually
being
lost
dissipated
by
the
diffusion
of
heat
and
degraded
its
tendency
being
to
arrive
at
a
and
homogeneity
that
which
has
value
and
more
than
value
reality
for
us
is
the
differential
which
is
the
qualitative
pure
undifferentiated
quantity
is
for
us
as
if
it
did
not
exist
for
it
does
not
act
and
the
material
universe
the
body
of
the
universe
would
appear
to
be
gradually
proceeding
unaffected
by
the
retarding
action
of
living
organisms
or
even
by
the
conscious
action
of
man
towards
a
state
of
perfect
stability
of
homogeneity
brunhes
for
while
spirit
tends
towards
concentration
material
energy
tends
towards
diffusion
and
may
not
this
have
an
intimate
relation
with
our
problem
may
there
not
be
a
connection
between
this
conclusion
of
scientific
philosophy
with
respect
to
a
final
state
of
stability
and
homogeneity
and
the
mystical
dream
of
the
apocatastasis
may
not
this
death
of
the
body
of
the
universe
be
the
final
triumph
of
its
spirit
of
god
it
is
manifest
that
there
is
an
intimate
relation
between
the
religious
need
of
an
eternal
life
after
death
and
the
conclusions
always
provisional
at
which
scientific
philosophy
arrives
with
respect
to
the
probable
future
of
the
material
or
sensible
universe
and
the
fact
is
that
just
as
there
are
theologians
of
god
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
so
there
are
also
those
whom
brunhes
calls
chap
theologians
of
monism
and
whom
it
would
perhaps
be
better
to
call
atheologians
people
who
pertinaciously
adhere
to
the
spirit
of
affirmation
and
this
becomes
intolerable
brunhes
adds
when
they
harbour
the
pretension
of
despising
theology
a
notable
type
of
these
gentlemen
may
be
found
in
haeckel
who
has
succeeded
in
solving
the
riddles
of
nature
these
atheologians
have
seized
upon
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
the
nothing
is
created
nothing
is
lost
everything
is
transformed
formula
the
theological
origin
of
which
is
seen
in
descartes
and
have
made
use
of
it
as
a
means
whereby
we
are
able
to
dispense
with
god
the
world
built
to
last
brunhes
comments
resisting
all
wear
and
tear
or
rather
automatically
repairing
the
rents
that
appear
in
it
what
a
splendid
theme
for
oratorical
amplification
but
these
same
amplifications
which
served
in
the
seventeenth
century
to
prove
the
wisdom
of
the
creator
have
been
used
in
our
days
as
arguments
for
those
who
presume
to
do
without
him
it
is
the
old
story
scientific
philosophy
the
origin
and
inspiration
of
which
is
fundamentally
theological
or
religious
ending
in
an
atheology
or
irreligion
which
is
itself
nothing
else
but
theology
and
religion
let
us
call
to
mind
the
comments
of
ritschl
upon
this
head
already
quoted
in
this
work
the
last
word
of
science
or
rather
of
scientific
philosophy
appears
to
be
that
by
virtue
of
the
degradation
of
energy
of
the
predominance
of
irreversible
phenomena
the
material
sensible
world
is
travelling
towards
a
condition
of
ultimate
levelness
a
kind
of
final
homogeneity
and
this
brings
to
our
mind
the
hypothesis
not
only
so
much
used
but
abused
by
spencer
of
a
primordial
homogeneity
and
his
fantastic
theory
of
the
instability
of
the
homogeneous
an
instability
that
required
the
atheological
agnosticism
of
spencer
in
order
to
explain
the
inexplicable
transition
from
the
homogeneous
to
the
heterogeneous
for
how
without
any
action
from
without
can
any
heterogeneity
emerge
from
perfect
and
absolute
homogeneity
but
as
it
was
necessary
to
get
rid
of
every
kind
of
creation
the
unemployed
engineer
turned
metaphysician
as
papini
called
him
invented
the
theory
of
the
instability
of
the
homogeneous
which
is
more
what
shall
i
say
more
mystical
and
even
more
mythological
if
you
like
than
the
creative
action
of
god
the
italian
positivist
roberto
ardigo
was
nearer
the
mark
when
objecting
to
spencer
theory
he
said
that
the
most
natural
supposition
was
that
things
always
were
as
they
are
now
that
always
there
have
been
worlds
in
process
of
formation
in
the
nebulous
stage
worlds
completely
formed
and
worlds
in
process
of
dissolution
that
heterogeneity
in
short
is
eternal
another
way
it
will
be
seen
of
not
solving
the
riddle
is
this
perhaps
the
solution
but
in
that
case
the
universe
would
be
infinite
and
in
reality
we
are
unable
to
conceive
a
universe
that
is
both
eternal
and
limited
such
as
that
which
served
as
the
basis
of
nietzsche
theory
of
eternal
recurrence
if
the
universe
must
be
eternal
if
within
it
and
as
regards
each
of
its
component
worlds
periods
in
which
the
movement
is
towards
homogeneity
towards
the
degradation
of
energy
must
alternate
with
other
periods
in
which
the
movement
is
towards
heterogeneity
then
it
is
necessary
that
the
universe
should
be
infinite
that
there
should
be
scope
always
and
in
each
world
for
some
action
coming
from
without
and
in
fact
the
body
of
god
can
not
be
other
than
eternal
and
infinite
but
as
far
as
our
own
world
is
concerned
its
gradual
or
we
might
say
its
death
appears
to
be
proved
and
how
will
this
process
affect
the
fate
of
our
spirit
will
it
wane
with
the
degradation
of
the
energy
of
our
world
and
return
to
unconsciousness
or
will
it
rather
grow
according
as
the
utilizable
energy
diminishes
and
by
virtue
of
the
very
efforts
that
it
makes
to
retard
this
degradation
and
to
dominate
nature
for
this
it
is
that
constitutes
the
life
of
the
spirit
may
it
be
that
consciousness
and
its
extended
support
are
two
powers
in
contraposition
the
one
growing
at
the
expense
of
the
other
the
fact
is
that
the
best
of
our
scientific
work
the
best
of
our
industry
that
part
of
it
i
mean
and
it
is
a
large
part
that
does
not
tend
to
destruction
is
directed
towards
retarding
this
fatal
process
of
the
degradation
of
energy
and
organic
life
the
support
of
our
consciousness
is
itself
an
effort
to
avoid
so
far
as
it
is
possible
this
fatal
period
to
postpone
it
it
is
useless
to
seek
to
deceive
ourselves
with
pagan
pæans
in
praise
of
nature
for
as
leopardi
that
christian
atheist
said
with
profound
truth
in
his
stupendous
poem
nature
gives
us
life
like
a
mother
but
loves
us
like
a
the
origin
of
human
companionship
was
opposition
to
nature
it
was
horror
of
impious
nature
that
first
linked
men
together
in
the
bonds
of
society
it
is
human
society
in
effect
the
source
of
reflective
consciousness
and
of
the
craving
for
immortality
that
inaugurates
the
state
of
grace
upon
the
state
of
nature
and
it
is
man
who
by
humanizing
and
spiritualizing
nature
by
his
industry
supernaturalizes
her
in
two
amazing
sonnets
which
he
called
the
tragic
portuguese
poet
antero
de
quental
embodied
his
dream
of
a
spirit
imprisoned
not
in
atoms
or
ions
or
crystals
but
as
is
natural
in
a
poet
in
the
sea
in
trees
in
the
forest
in
the
mountains
in
the
wind
in
all
material
individualities
and
forms
and
he
imagines
that
a
day
may
come
when
all
these
captive
souls
as
yet
in
the
limbo
of
existence
will
awaken
to
consciousness
and
emerging
as
pure
thought
from
the
forms
that
imprisoned
them
they
will
see
these
forms
the
creatures
of
illusion
fall
away
and
dissolve
like
a
baseless
vision
it
is
a
magnificent
dream
of
the
penetration
of
everything
by
consciousness
may
it
not
be
that
the
universe
our
universe
who
knows
if
there
are
others
began
with
a
zero
of
spirit
and
zero
is
not
the
same
as
nothing
and
an
infinite
of
matter
and
that
its
goal
is
to
end
with
an
infinite
of
spirit
and
a
zero
of
matter
dreams
may
it
be
that
everything
has
a
soul
and
that
this
soul
begs
to
be
freed

sings
our
poet
antonio
machado
in
his

is
the
sadness
of
the
field
in
the
fields
themselves
or
in
us
who
look
upon
them
do
they
not
suffer
but
what
can
an
individual
soul
in
a
world
of
matter
actually
be
is
it
the
rock
or
the
mountain
that
is
the
individual
is
it
the
tree
and
nevertheless
the
fact
always
remains
that
spirit
and
matter
are
at
strife
this
is
the
thought
that
espronceda
expressed
when
he
wrote
para
vivir
en
santa
calma
o
sobra
la
materia
o
sobra
el
and
is
there
not
in
the
history
of
thought
or
of
human
imagination
if
you
prefer
it
something
that
corresponds
to
this
process
of
the
reduction
of
matter
in
the
sense
of
a
reduction
of
everything
to
consciousness
yes
there
is
and
its
author
is
the
first
christian
mystic
paul
of
tarsus
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
he
who
because
he
had
never
with
his
bodily
eyes
looked
upon
the
face
of
the
fleshly
and
mortal
christ
the
ethical
christ
created
within
himself
an
immortal
and
religious
christ
he
who
was
caught
up
into
the
third
heaven
and
there
beheld
secret
and
unspeakable
things
cor
and
this
first
christian
mystic
dreamed
also
of
a
final
triumph
of
spirit
of
consciousness
and
this
is
what
in
theology
is
technically
called
the
apocatastasis
or
restitution
in
cor
xv
he
tells
us
that
the
last
enemy
that
shall
be
destroyed
is
death
for
he
hath
put
all
things
under
his
feet
but
when
he
saith
all
things
are
put
under
him
it
is
manifest
that
he
is
excepted
which
did
put
all
things
under
him
and
when
all
things
shall
be
subdued
unto
him
then
shall
the
son
also
himself
be
subject
unto
him
that
put
all
things
under
him
that
god
may
be
all
in
all
hê
ho
theos
panta
en
that
is
to
say
that
the
end
is
that
god
consciousness
will
end
by
being
all
in
all
this
doctrine
is
completed
by
paul
teaching
in
his
epistle
to
the
ephesians
with
regard
to
the
end
of
the
whole
history
of
the
world
in
this
epistle
as
you
know
he
represents
christ
by
whom
were
all
things
created
that
are
in
heaven
and
that
are
in
earth
visible
and
invisible
i
as
the
head
over
all
things
eph
i
and
in
him
in
this
head
we
all
shall
be
raised
up
that
we
may
live
in
the
communion
of
saints
and
that
we
may
be
able
to
comprehend
with
all
saints
what
is
the
breadth
and
length
and
depth
and
height
and
to
know
the
love
of
christ
which
passeth
knowledge
eph
iii
and
this
gathering
of
us
together
in
christ
who
is
the
head
and
as
it
were
the
compendium
of
humanity
is
what
the
apostle
calls
the
gathering
or
collecting
together
or
recapitulating
of
all
things
in
christ
ta
panta
en
and
this
recapitulation
anacefaleosis
the
end
of
the
history
and
of
the
human
race
is
merely
another
aspect
of
the
apocatastasis
the
apocatastasis
god
coming
to
be
all
in
all
thus
resolves
itself
into
the
anacefaleosis
the
gathering
together
of
all
things
in
christ
in
humanity
humanity
therefore
being
the
end
of
creation
and
does
not
this
apocatastasis
this
humanization
or
divinization
of
all
things
do
away
with
matter
but
if
matter
which
is
the
principle
of
individuation
the
scholastic
is
once
done
away
with
does
not
everything
return
to
pure
consciousness
which
in
its
pure
purity
neither
knows
itself
nor
is
it
anything
that
can
be
conceived
or
felt
and
if
matter
be
abolished
what
support
is
there
left
for
spirit
thus
a
different
train
of
thought
leads
us
to
the
same
difficulties
the
same
unthinkabilities
it
may
be
said
on
the
other
hand
that
the
apocatastasis
god
coming
to
be
all
in
all
presupposes
that
there
was
a
time
when
he
was
not
all
in
all
the
supposition
that
all
beings
shall
attain
to
the
enjoyment
of
god
implies
the
supposition
that
god
shall
attain
to
the
enjoyment
of
all
beings
for
the
beatific
vision
is
mutual
and
god
is
perfected
in
being
better
known
and
his
being
is
nourished
and
enriched
with
souls
following
up
the
track
of
these
wild
dreams
we
might
imagine
an
unconscious
god
slumbering
in
matter
and
gradually
wakening
into
consciousness
of
everything
consciousness
of
his
own
divinity
we
might
imagine
the
whole
universe
becoming
conscious
of
itself
as
a
whole
and
becoming
conscious
of
each
of
its
constituent
consciousnesses
becoming
god
but
in
that
case
how
did
this
unconscious
god
begin
is
he
not
matter
itself
god
would
thus
be
not
the
beginning
but
the
end
of
the
universe
but
can
that
be
the
end
which
was
not
the
beginning
or
can
it
be
that
outside
time
in
eternity
there
is
a
difference
between
beginning
and
end
the
soul
of
all
things
can
not
be
bound
by
that
very
thing
that
is
matter
which
it
itself
has
bound
says
plotinus
ix
or
is
it
not
rather
the
consciousness
of
the
whole
that
strives
to
become
the
consciousness
of
each
part
and
to
make
each
partial
consciousness
conscious
of
itself
that
is
of
the
total
consciousness
is
not
this
universal
soul
a
monotheist
or
solitary
god
who
is
in
process
of
becoming
a
pantheist
god
and
if
it
is
not
so
if
matter
and
pain
are
alien
to
god
wherefore
it
will
be
asked
did
god
create
the
world
for
what
purpose
did
he
make
matter
and
introduce
pain
would
it
not
have
been
better
if
he
had
not
made
anything
what
added
glory
does
he
gain
by
the
creation
of
angels
or
of
men
whose
fall
he
must
punish
with
eternal
torment
did
he
perhaps
create
evil
for
the
sake
of
remedying
it
or
was
redemption
his
design
redemption
complete
and
absolute
redemption
of
all
things
and
of
all
men
for
this
hypothesis
is
neither
more
rational
nor
more
pious
than
the
other
in
so
far
as
we
attempt
to
represent
eternal
happiness
to
ourselves
we
are
confronted
by
a
series
of
questions
to
which
there
is
no
satisfactory
that
is
rational
answer
and
it
matters
not
whether
the
supposition
from
which
we
start
be
monotheist
or
pantheist
or
even
panentheist
let
us
return
to
the
pauline
apocatastasis
is
it
not
possible
that
in
becoming
all
in
all
god
completes
himself
becomes
at
last
fully
god
an
infinite
consciousness
embracing
all
consciousnesses
and
what
is
an
infinite
consciousness
since
consciousness
supposes
limitation
or
rather
since
consciousness
is
consciousness
of
limitation
of
distinction
does
it
not
thereby
exclude
infinitude
what
value
has
the
notion
of
infinitude
applied
to
consciousness
what
is
a
consciousness
that
is
all
consciousness
without
anything
outside
it
that
is
not
consciousness
in
such
a
case
of
what
is
consciousness
the
consciousness
of
its
content
or
may
it
not
rather
be
that
starting
from
chaos
from
absolute
unconsciousness
in
the
eternity
of
the
past
we
continually
approach
the
apocatastasis
or
final
apotheosis
without
ever
reaching
it
may
not
this
apocatastasis
this
return
of
all
things
to
god
be
rather
an
ideal
term
to
which
we
unceasingly
approach
some
of
us
with
fleeter
step
than
others
but
which
we
are
destined
never
to
reach
may
not
the
absolute
and
perfect
eternal
happiness
be
an
eternal
hope
which
would
die
if
it
were
to
be
realized
is
it
possible
to
be
happy
without
hope
and
there
is
no
place
for
hope
when
once
possession
has
been
realized
for
hope
desire
is
killed
by
possession
may
it
not
be
i
say
that
all
souls
grow
without
ceasing
some
in
a
greater
measure
than
others
but
all
having
to
pass
some
time
through
the
same
degree
of
growth
whatever
that
degree
may
be
and
yet
without
ever
arriving
at
the
infinite
at
god
to
whom
they
continually
approach
is
not
eternal
happiness
an
eternal
hope
with
its
eternal
nucleus
of
sorrow
in
order
that
happiness
shall
not
be
swallowed
up
in
nothingness
follow
more
questions
to
which
there
is
no
answer
he
shall
be
all
in
all
says
the
apostle
but
will
his
mode
of
being
in
each
one
be
different
or
will
it
be
the
same
for
all
alike
will
not
god
be
wholly
in
one
of
the
damned
is
he
not
in
his
soul
is
he
not
in
what
is
called
hell
and
in
what
sense
is
he
in
hell
whence
arise
new
problems
those
relating
to
the
opposition
between
heaven
and
hell
between
eternal
happiness
and
eternal
unhappiness
may
it
not
be
that
in
the
end
all
shall
be
saved
including
cain
and
judas
and
satan
himself
as
origen
development
of
the
pauline
apocatastasis
led
him
to
hope
when
our
catholic
theologians
seek
to
justify
rationally
or
in
other
words
ethically
the
dogma
of
the
eternity
of
the
pains
of
hell
they
put
forward
reasons
so
specious
ridiculous
and
childish
that
it
would
appear
impossible
that
they
should
ever
have
obtained
currency
for
to
assert
that
since
god
is
infinite
an
offence
committed
against
him
is
infinite
also
and
therefore
demands
an
eternal
punishment
is
apart
from
the
inconceivability
of
an
infinite
offence
to
be
unaware
that
in
human
ethics
if
not
in
the
human
police
system
the
gravity
of
the
offence
is
measured
not
by
the
dignity
of
the
injured
person
but
by
the
intention
of
the
injurer
and
that
to
speak
of
an
infinite
culpable
intention
is
sheer
nonsense
and
nothing
else
in
this
connection
those
words
which
christ
addressed
to
his
father
are
capable
of
application
father
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
and
no
man
who
commits
an
offence
against
god
or
his
neighbour
knows
what
he
does
in
human
ethics
or
if
you
like
in
human
police
regulations
that
which
is
called
penal
law
and
is
anything
but
law
eternal
punishment
is
a
meaningless
phrase
god
is
just
and
punishes
us
that
is
all
we
need
to
know
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
the
rest
is
merely
curiosity
such
was
the
conclusion
of
lamennais
partie
chap
vii
an
opinion
shared
by
many
others
calvin
also
held
the
same
view
but
is
there
anyone
who
is
content
with
this
pure
curiosity
to
call
this
load
that
wellnigh
crushes
our
heart
pure
curiosity
may
we
not
say
perhaps
that
the
evil
man
is
annihilated
because
he
wished
to
be
annihilated
or
that
he
did
not
wish
strongly
enough
to
eternalize
himself
because
he
was
evil
may
we
not
say
that
it
is
not
believing
in
the
other
life
that
makes
a
man
good
but
rather
that
being
good
makes
him
believe
in
it
and
what
is
being
good
and
being
evil
these
states
pertain
to
the
sphere
of
ethics
not
of
religion
or
rather
does
not
the
doing
good
though
being
evil
pertain
to
ethics
and
the
being
good
though
doing
evil
to
religion
shall
we
not
perhaps
be
told
on
the
other
hand
that
if
the
sinner
suffers
an
eternal
punishment
it
is
because
he
does
not
cease
to
sin
for
the
damned
sin
without
ceasing
this
however
is
no
solution
of
the
problem
which
derives
all
its
absurdity
from
the
fact
that
punishment
has
been
conceived
as
vindictiveness
or
vengeance
not
as
correction
has
been
conceived
after
the
fashion
of
barbarous
peoples
and
in
the
same
way
hell
has
been
conceived
as
a
sort
of
police
institution
necessary
in
order
to
put
fear
into
the
world
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
it
no
longer
intimidates
and
therefore
will
have
to
be
shut
up
but
on
the
other
hand
as
a
religious
conception
and
veiled
in
mystery
why
not
although
the
idea
revolts
our
feelings
an
eternity
of
suffering
why
not
a
god
who
is
nourished
by
our
suffering
is
our
happiness
the
end
of
the
universe
or
may
we
possibly
sustain
with
our
suffering
some
alien
happiness
let
us
read
again
in
the
of
that
terrible
tragedian
æschylus
those
choruses
of
the
furies
in
which
they
curse
the
new
gods
for
overturning
the
ancient
laws
and
snatching
orestes
from
their
hands
impassioned
invectives
against
the
apollinian
redemption
does
not
redemption
tear
man
their
captive
and
plaything
from
the
hands
of
the
gods
who
delight
and
amuse
themselves
in
his
sufferings
like
children
as
the
tragic
poet
says
torturing
beetles
and
let
us
remember
the
cry
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
yes
why
not
an
eternity
of
suffering
hell
is
an
eternalization
of
the
soul
even
though
it
be
an
eternity
of
pain
is
not
pain
essential
to
life
men
go
on
inventing
theories
to
explain
what
they
call
the
origin
of
evil
and
why
not
the
origin
of
good
why
suppose
that
it
is
good
that
is
positive
and
original
and
evil
that
is
negative
and
derivatory
everything
that
is
in
so
far
as
it
is
is
good
augustine
affirmed
but
why
what
does
being
good
mean
good
is
good
for
something
conducive
to
an
end
and
to
say
that
everything
is
good
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
everything
is
making
for
its
end
but
what
is
its
end
our
desire
is
to
eternalize
ourselves
to
persist
and
we
call
good
everything
that
conspires
to
this
end
and
bad
everything
that
tends
to
lessen
or
destroy
our
consciousness
we
suppose
that
human
consciousness
is
an
end
and
not
a
means
to
something
else
which
may
not
be
consciousness
whether
human
or
superhuman
all
metaphysical
optimism
such
as
that
of
leibnitz
and
all
metaphysical
pessimism
such
as
that
of
schopenhauer
have
no
other
foundation
than
this
for
leibnitz
this
world
is
the
best
because
it
conspires
to
perpetuate
consciousness
and
together
with
consciousness
will
because
intelligence
increases
will
and
perfects
it
because
the
end
of
man
is
the
contemplation
of
god
while
for
schopenhauer
this
world
is
the
worst
of
all
possible
worlds
because
it
conspires
to
destroy
will
because
intelligence
representation
nullifies
the
will
that
begot
it
and
similarly
franklin
who
believed
in
another
life
asserted
that
he
was
willing
to
live
this
life
over
again
the
life
that
he
had
actually
lived
from
its
beginning
to
the
end
while
leopardi
who
did
not
believe
in
another
life
asserted
that
nobody
would
consent
to
live
his
life
over
again
these
two
views
of
life
are
not
merely
ethical
but
religious
and
the
feeling
of
moral
good
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
teleological
value
is
of
religious
origin
also
and
to
return
to
our
interrogations
shall
not
all
be
saved
shall
not
all
be
made
eternal
and
eternal
not
in
suffering
but
in
happiness
those
whom
we
call
good
and
those
whom
we
call
bad
alike
and
as
regards
this
question
of
good
and
evil
does
not
the
malice
of
him
who
judges
enter
in
is
the
badness
in
the
intention
of
him
who
does
the
deed
or
is
it
not
rather
in
that
of
him
who
judges
it
to
be
bad
but
the
terrible
thing
is
that
man
judges
himself
creates
himself
his
own
judge
who
then
shall
be
saved
and
now
the
imagination
puts
forth
another
possibility
neither
more
nor
less
rational
than
all
those
which
have
just
been
put
forward
interrogatively
and
that
is
that
only
those
are
saved
who
have
longed
to
be
saved
that
only
those
are
eternalized
who
have
lived
in
an
agony
of
hunger
for
eternity
and
for
eternalization
he
who
desires
never
to
die
and
believes
that
he
shall
never
die
in
the
spirit
desires
it
because
he
deserves
it
or
rather
only
he
desires
personal
immortality
who
carries
his
immortality
within
him
the
man
who
does
not
long
passionately
and
with
a
passion
that
triumphs
over
all
the
dictates
of
reason
for
his
own
immortality
is
the
man
who
does
not
deserve
it
and
because
he
does
not
deserve
it
he
does
not
long
for
it
and
it
is
no
injustice
not
to
give
a
man
that
which
he
does
not
know
how
to
desire
for
ask
and
it
shall
be
given
you
it
may
be
that
to
each
will
be
given
that
which
he
desired
and
perhaps
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
for
which
according
to
the
evangelist
there
is
no
remission
is
none
other
than
that
of
not
desiring
god
not
longing
to
be
made
eternal
as
is
your
sort
of
mind
so
is
your
sort
of
search
you
find
what
you
desire
and
that
to
be
a
christian
said
robert
browning
in
eve
and
easter
in
his
dante
condemned
the
epicureans
those
who
did
not
believe
in
another
life
to
something
more
terrible
than
the
not
having
it
and
that
is
the
consciousness
of
not
having
it
and
this
he
expressed
in
plastic
form
by
picturing
them
shut
up
in
their
tombs
for
all
eternity
without
light
without
air
without
fire
without
movement
without
life
what
cruelty
is
there
in
denying
to
a
man
that
which
he
did
not
or
could
not
desire
in
the
sixth
book
of
his
the
gentle
virgil
makes
us
hear
the
plaintive
voices
and
sobbing
of
the
babes
who
weep
upon
the
threshold
of
hades
àuditæ
voces
vagitus
et
ingens
infantumque
animæ
flentes
in
limine
primo
unhappy
in
that
they
had
but
entered
upon
life
and
never
known
the
sweetness
of
it
and
whom
torn
from
their
mothers
breasts
a
dark
day
had
cut
off
and
drowned
in
bitter
death
dulcis
vitæ
exsortes
et
at
ubere
raptos
abstulit
atra
dies
et
funere
mersit
but
what
life
did
they
lose
if
they
neither
knew
life
nor
longed
for
it
and
yet
is
it
true
that
they
never
longed
for
it
it
may
be
said
that
others
craved
life
on
their
behalf
that
their
parents
longed
for
them
to
be
eternal
to
the
end
that
they
might
be
gladdened
by
them
in
paradise
and
so
a
fresh
field
is
opened
up
for
the
imagination
namely
the
consideration
of
the
solidarity
and
representivity
of
eternal
salvation
there
are
many
indeed
who
imagine
the
human
race
as
one
being
a
collective
and
solidary
individual
in
whom
each
member
may
represent
or
may
come
to
represent
the
total
collectivity
and
they
imagine
salvation
as
something
collective
as
something
collective
also
merit
and
as
something
collective
sin
and
redemption
according
to
this
mode
of
feeling
and
imagining
either
all
are
saved
or
none
is
saved
redemption
is
total
and
it
is
mutual
each
man
is
his
neighbour
christ
and
is
there
not
perhaps
a
hint
of
this
in
the
popular
catholic
belief
with
regard
to
souls
in
purgatory
the
belief
that
the
living
may
devote
suffrages
and
apply
merits
to
the
souls
of
their
dead
this
sense
of
the
transmission
of
merits
both
to
the
living
and
the
dead
is
general
in
popular
catholic
piety
nor
should
it
be
forgotten
that
in
the
history
of
man
religious
thought
there
has
often
presented
itself
the
idea
of
an
immortality
restricted
to
a
certain
number
of
the
elect
spirits
representative
of
the
rest
and
in
a
certain
sense
including
them
an
idea
of
pagan
derivation
for
such
were
the
heroes
and
which
sometimes
shelters
itself
behind
the
pronouncement
that
there
are
many
that
are
called
and
few
that
are
chosen
recently
while
i
was
engaged
upon
this
essay
there
came
into
my
hands
the
third
edition
of
the
sur
la
vie
et
sur
la
by
charles
bonnefon
a
book
in
which
imaginative
conceptions
similar
to
those
that
i
have
been
setting
forth
find
succinct
and
suggestive
expression
the
soul
can
not
live
without
the
body
bonnefon
says
nor
the
body
without
the
soul
and
thus
neither
birth
nor
death
has
any
real
existence
strictly
speaking
there
is
no
body
no
soul
no
birth
no
death
all
of
which
are
abstractions
and
appearances
but
only
a
thinking
life
of
which
we
form
part
and
which
can
neither
be
born
nor
die
hence
he
is
led
to
deny
human
individuality
and
to
assert
that
no
one
can
say
i
am
but
only
we
are
or
more
correctly
there
is
in
us
it
is
humanity
the
species
that
thinks
and
loves
in
us
and
souls
are
transmitted
in
the
same
way
that
bodies
are
transmitted
the
living
thought
or
the
thinking
life
which
we
are
will
find
itself
again
immediately
in
a
form
analogous
to
that
which
was
our
origin
and
corresponding
with
our
being
in
the
womb
of
a
pregnant
woman
each
of
us
therefore
has
lived
before
and
will
live
again
although
he
does
not
know
it
if
humanity
is
gradually
raised
above
itself
when
the
last
man
dies
the
man
who
will
contain
all
the
rest
of
mankind
in
himself
who
shall
say
that
he
may
not
have
arrived
at
that
higher
order
of
humanity
such
as
exists
elsewhere
in
heaven
as
we
are
all
bound
together
in
solidarity
we
shall
all
little
by
little
gather
the
fruits
of
our
travail
according
to
this
mode
of
imagining
and
thinking
since
nobody
is
born
nobody
dies
no
single
soul
has
finished
its
struggle
but
many
times
has
been
plunged
into
the
midst
of
the
human
struggle
ever
since
the
type
of
embryo
corresponding
with
the
same
consciousness
was
represented
in
the
succession
of
human
phenomena
it
is
obvious
that
since
bonnefon
begins
by
denying
personal
individuality
he
leaves
out
of
account
our
real
longing
which
is
to
save
our
individuality
but
on
the
other
hand
since
he
bonnefon
is
a
personal
individual
and
feels
this
longing
he
has
recourse
to
the
distinction
between
the
called
and
the
chosen
and
to
the
idea
of
representative
spirits
and
he
concedes
to
a
certain
number
of
men
this
representative
individual
immortality
of
these
elect
he
says
that
they
will
be
somewhat
more
necessary
to
god
than
we
ourselves
and
he
closes
this
splendid
dream
by
supposing
that
it
is
not
impossible
that
we
shall
arrive
by
a
series
of
ascensions
at
the
supreme
happiness
and
that
our
life
shall
be
merged
in
the
perfect
life
as
a
drop
of
water
in
the
sea
then
we
shall
understand
he
continues
that
everything
was
necessary
that
every
philosophy
and
every
religion
had
its
hour
of
truth
and
that
in
all
our
wanderings
and
errors
and
in
the
darkest
moments
of
our
history
we
discerned
the
light
of
the
distant
beacon
and
that
we
were
all
predestined
to
participate
in
the
eternal
light
and
if
the
god
whom
we
shall
find
again
possesses
a
body
and
we
can
not
conceive
a
living
god
without
a
body
we
together
with
each
of
the
myriads
of
races
that
the
myriads
of
suns
have
brought
forth
shall
be
the
conscious
cells
of
his
body
if
this
dream
should
be
fulfilled
an
ocean
of
love
would
beat
upon
our
shores
and
the
end
of
every
life
would
be
to
add
a
drop
of
water
to
this
ocean
infinity
and
what
is
this
cosmic
dream
of
bonnefon
but
the
plastic
representation
of
the
pauline
apocatastasis
yes
this
dream
which
has
its
origin
far
back
in
the
dawn
of
christianity
is
fundamentally
the
same
as
the
pauline
anacefaleosis
the
fusion
of
all
men
in
man
in
the
whole
of
humanity
embodied
in
a
person
who
is
christ
and
the
fusion
not
only
of
all
men
but
of
all
things
and
the
subsequent
subjection
of
all
things
to
god
in
order
that
god
consciousness
may
be
all
in
all
and
this
supposes
a
collective
redemption
and
a
society
beyond
the
grave
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
two
pietists
of
protestant
origin
johann
jakob
moser
and
friedrich
christoph
oetinger
gave
a
new
force
and
value
to
the
pauline
anacefaleosis
moser
declared
that
his
religion
consisted
not
in
holding
certain
doctrines
to
be
true
and
in
living
a
virtuous
life
conformably
therewith
but
in
being
reunited
to
god
through
christ
but
this
demands
the
thorough
knowledge
a
knowledge
that
goes
on
increasing
until
the
end
of
life
of
one
own
sins
and
also
of
the
mercy
and
patience
of
god
the
transformation
of
all
natural
feelings
the
appropriation
of
the
atonement
wrought
by
the
death
of
christ
the
enjoyment
of
peace
with
god
in
the
permanent
witness
of
the
holy
spirit
to
the
remission
of
sins
the
ordering
of
life
according
to
the
pattern
of
christ
which
is
the
fruit
of
faith
alone
the
drawing
near
to
god
and
the
intercourse
of
the
soul
with
him
the
disposition
to
die
in
grace
and
the
joyful
expectation
of
the
judgement
which
will
bestow
blessedness
in
the
more
intimate
enjoyment
of
god
and
in
the
with
all
the
ritschl
des
vol
the
commerce
with
all
the
saints
that
is
to
say
the
eternal
human
society
and
for
his
part
oetinger
considers
eternal
happiness
not
as
the
contemplation
of
god
in
his
infinitude
but
taking
the
epistle
to
the
ephesians
as
his
authority
as
the
contemplation
of
god
in
the
harmony
of
the
creature
with
christ
the
commerce
with
all
the
saints
was
according
to
him
essential
to
the
content
of
eternal
happiness
it
was
the
realization
of
the
kingdom
of
god
which
thus
comes
to
be
the
kingdom
of
man
and
in
his
exposition
of
these
doctrines
of
the
two
pietists
ritschl
confesses
op
that
both
witnesses
have
with
these
doctrines
contributed
something
to
protestantism
that
is
of
like
value
with
the
theological
method
of
spener
another
pietist
we
see
therefore
that
the
christian
mystical
inward
longing
ever
since
paul
has
been
to
give
human
finality
or
divine
finality
to
the
universe
to
save
human
consciousness
and
to
save
it
by
converting
all
humanity
into
a
person
this
longing
is
expressed
in
the
anacefaleosis
the
gathering
together
of
all
things
all
things
in
earth
and
in
heaven
the
visible
and
the
invisible
in
christ
and
also
in
the
apocatastasis
the
return
of
all
things
to
god
to
consciousness
in
order
that
god
may
be
all
in
all
and
does
not
god
being
all
in
all
mean
that
all
things
shall
acquire
consciousness
and
that
in
this
consciousness
everything
that
has
happened
will
come
to
life
again
and
that
everything
that
has
existed
in
time
will
be
eternalized
and
within
the
all
all
individual
consciousnesses
those
which
have
been
those
that
are
and
those
that
will
be
and
as
they
have
been
as
they
are
and
as
they
will
be
will
exist
in
a
condition
of
society
and
solidarity
but
does
not
this
awakening
to
consciousness
of
everything
that
has
been
necessarily
involve
a
fusion
of
the
identical
an
amalgamation
of
like
things
in
this
conversion
of
the
human
race
into
a
true
society
in
christ
a
communion
of
saints
a
kingdom
of
heaven
will
not
individual
differences
tainted
as
they
are
with
deceit
and
even
with
sin
be
obliterated
and
in
the
perfect
society
will
that
alone
remain
of
each
man
which
was
the
essential
part
of
him
would
it
not
perhaps
result
according
to
bonnefon
supposition
that
this
consciousness
that
lived
in
the
twentieth
century
in
this
corner
of
this
earth
would
feel
itself
to
be
the
same
with
other
such
consciousnesses
as
have
lived
in
other
centuries
and
perhaps
in
other
worlds
and
how
can
we
conceive
of
an
effective
and
real
union
a
substantial
and
intimate
union
soul
with
soul
of
all
those
who
have
been
if
any
two
creatures
grew
into
one
they
would
do
more
than
the
world
has
done
said
browning
in
flight
of
the
and
christ
has
told
us
that
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
his
name
there
is
he
in
the
midst
of
them
heaven
then
so
it
is
believed
by
many
is
society
a
more
perfect
society
than
that
of
this
world
it
is
human
society
fused
into
a
person
and
there
are
not
wanting
some
who
believe
that
the
tendency
of
all
human
progress
is
the
conversion
of
our
species
into
one
collective
being
with
real
consciousness
is
not
perhaps
an
individual
human
organism
a
kind
of
confederation
of
cells
and
that
when
it
shall
have
acquired
full
consciousness
all
those
who
have
existed
will
come
to
life
again
in
it
heaven
so
many
think
is
society
just
as
no
one
can
live
in
isolation
so
no
one
can
survive
in
isolation
no
one
can
enjoy
god
in
heaven
who
sees
his
brother
suffering
in
hell
for
the
sin
and
the
merit
were
common
to
both
we
think
with
the
thoughts
of
others
and
we
feel
with
the
feelings
of
others
to
see
god
when
god
shall
be
all
in
all
is
to
see
all
things
in
god
and
to
live
in
god
with
all
things
this
splendid
dream
of
the
final
solidarity
of
mankind
is
the
pauline
anacefaleosis
and
apocatastasis
we
christians
said
the
apostle
i
cor
xii
are
the
body
of
christ
members
of
him
flesh
of
his
flesh
and
bone
of
his
bone
eph
branches
of
the
vine
but
in
this
final
solidarization
in
this
true
and
supreme
of
all
creatures
what
becomes
of
each
individual
consciousness
what
becomes
of
me
of
this
poor
fragile
i
this
i
that
is
the
slave
of
time
and
space
this
i
which
reason
tells
me
is
a
mere
passing
accident
but
for
the
saving
of
which
i
live
and
suffer
and
hope
and
believe
granting
that
the
human
finality
of
the
universe
is
saved
that
consciousness
is
saved
would
i
resign
myself
to
make
the
sacrifice
of
this
poor
i
by
which
and
by
which
alone
i
know
this
finality
and
this
consciousness
and
here
facing
this
supreme
religious
sacrifice
we
reach
the
summit
of
the
tragedy
the
very
heart
of
it
the
sacrifice
of
our
own
individual
consciousness
upon
the
altar
of
the
perfected
human
consciousness
of
the
divine
consciousness
but
is
there
really
a
tragedy
if
we
could
attain
to
a
clear
vision
of
this
anacefaleosis
if
we
could
succeed
in
understanding
and
feeling
that
we
were
going
to
enrich
christ
should
we
hesitate
for
a
moment
in
surrendering
ourselves
utterly
to
him
would
the
stream
that
flows
into
the
sea
and
feels
in
the
freshness
of
its
waters
the
bitterness
of
the
salt
of
the
ocean
wish
to
flow
back
to
its
source
would
it
wish
to
return
to
the
cloud
which
drew
its
life
from
the
sea
is
not
its
joy
to
feel
itself
absorbed
and
yet
yes
in
spite
of
everything
this
is
the
climax
of
the
tragedy
and
the
soul
my
soul
at
least
longs
for
something
else
not
absorption
not
quietude
not
peace
not
appeasement
it
longs
ever
to
approach
and
never
to
arrive
it
longs
for
a
longing
for
an
eternal
hope
which
is
eternally
renewed
but
never
wholly
fulfilled
and
together
with
all
this
it
longs
for
an
eternal
lack
of
something
and
an
eternal
suffering
a
suffering
a
pain
thanks
to
which
it
grows
without
ceasing
in
consciousness
and
in
longing
do
not
write
upon
the
gate
of
heaven
that
sentence
which
dante
placed
over
the
threshold
of
hell
ogni
speranza
do
not
destroy
time
our
life
is
a
hope
which
is
continually
converting
itself
into
memory
and
memory
in
its
turn
begets
hope
give
us
leave
to
live
the
eternity
that
is
like
an
eternal
present
without
memory
and
without
hope
is
death
thus
do
ideas
exist
but
not
thus
do
men
live
thus
do
ideas
exist
in
the
but
not
thus
can
men
live
in
the
living
god
in
the
an
eternal
purgatory
then
rather
than
a
heaven
of
glory
an
eternal
ascent
if
there
is
an
end
of
all
suffering
however
pure
and
spiritualized
we
may
suppose
it
to
be
if
there
is
an
end
of
all
desire
what
is
it
that
makes
the
blessed
in
paradise
go
on
living
if
in
paradise
they
do
not
suffer
for
want
of
god
how
shall
they
love
him
and
if
even
there
in
the
heaven
of
glory
while
they
behold
god
little
by
little
and
closer
and
closer
yet
without
ever
wholly
attaining
to
him
there
does
not
always
remain
something
more
for
them
to
know
and
desire
if
there
does
not
always
remain
a
substratum
of
doubt
how
shall
they
not
fall
asleep
or
to
sum
up
if
in
heaven
there
does
not
remain
something
of
this
innermost
tragedy
of
the
soul
what
sort
of
a
life
is
that
is
there
perhaps
any
greater
joy
than
that
of
remembering
misery
and
to
remember
it
is
to
feel
it
in
time
of
felicity
does
not
the
prison
haunt
the
freed
prisoner
does
he
not
miss
his
former
dreams
of
liberty
mythological
dreams
it
will
be
said
and
i
have
not
pretended
that
they
are
anything
else
but
has
not
the
mythological
dream
its
content
of
truth
are
not
dream
and
myth
perhaps
revelations
of
an
inexpressible
truth
of
an
irrational
truth
of
a
truth
that
can
not
be
proven
mythology
perhaps
but
as
in
the
days
of
plato
we
must
needs
mythologize
when
we
come
to
deal
with
the
other
life
but
we
have
just
seen
that
whenever
we
seek
to
give
a
form
that
is
concrete
conceivable
or
in
other
words
rational
to
our
primary
primordial
and
fundamental
longing
for
an
eternal
life
conscious
of
itself
and
of
its
personal
individuality
esthetic
logical
and
ethical
absurdities
are
multiplied
and
there
is
no
way
of
conceiving
the
beatific
vision
and
the
apocatastasis
that
is
free
from
contradictions
and
inconsistencies
and
nevertheless
nevertheless
yes
we
must
needs
long
for
it
however
absurd
it
may
appear
to
us
nay
more
we
must
needs
believe
in
it
in
some
way
or
another
in
order
that
we
may
live
in
order
that
we
may
live
eh
not
in
order
that
we
may
understand
the
universe
we
must
needs
believe
in
it
and
to
believe
in
it
is
to
be
religious
christianity
the
only
religion
which
we
europeans
of
the
twentieth
century
are
really
capable
of
feeling
is
as
kierkegaard
said
a
desperate
sortie
uvidenskabelig
cap
i
a
sortie
which
can
be
successful
only
by
means
of
the
martyrdom
of
faith
which
is
according
to
this
same
tragic
thinker
the
crucifixion
of
reason
not
without
reason
did
he
who
had
the
right
to
do
so
speak
of
the
foolishness
of
the
cross
foolishness
without
doubt
foolishness
and
the
american
humorist
oliver
wendell
holmes
was
not
altogether
wide
of
the
mark
in
making
one
of
the
characters
in
his
ingenious
conversations
say
that
he
thought
better
of
those
who
were
confined
in
a
lunatic
asylum
on
account
of
religious
mania
than
of
those
who
while
professing
the
same
religious
principles
kept
their
wits
and
appeared
to
enjoy
life
very
well
outside
of
the
asylums
but
those
who
are
at
large
are
they
not
really
thanks
to
god
mad
too
are
there
not
mild
madnesses
which
not
only
permit
us
to
mix
with
our
neighbours
without
danger
to
society
but
which
rather
enable
us
to
do
so
for
by
means
of
them
we
are
able
to
attribute
a
meaning
and
finality
to
life
and
society
themselves
and
after
all
what
is
madness
and
how
can
we
distinguish
it
from
reason
unless
we
place
ourselves
outside
both
the
one
and
the
other
which
for
us
is
impossible
madness
perhaps
it
is
and
great
madness
to
seek
to
penetrate
into
the
mystery
of
the
beyond
madness
to
seek
to
superimpose
the
dreams
of
our
imagination
upon
the
dictates
of
a
sane
reason
and
a
sane
reason
tells
us
that
nothing
can
be
built
up
without
foundations
and
that
it
is
not
merely
an
idle
but
a
subversive
task
to
fill
the
void
of
the
unknown
with
fantasies
and
nevertheless
we
must
needs
believe
in
the
other
life
in
the
eternal
life
beyond
the
grave
and
in
an
individual
and
personal
life
in
a
life
in
which
each
one
of
us
may
feel
his
consciousness
and
fed
that
it
is
united
without
being
confounded
with
all
other
consciousnesses
in
the
supreme
consciousness
in
god
we
must
needs
believe
in
that
other
life
in
order
that
we
may
live
this
life
and
endure
it
and
give
it
meaning
and
finality
and
we
must
needs
believe
in
that
other
life
perhaps
in
order
that
we
may
deserve
it
in
order
that
we
may
obtain
it
for
it
may
be
that
he
neither
deserves
it
nor
will
obtain
it
who
does
not
passionately
desire
it
above
reason
and
if
need
be
against
reason
and
above
all
we
must
feel
and
act
as
if
an
endless
continuation
of
our
earthly
life
awaited
us
after
death

if
it

that
awaits

we

several
times
in
the
devious
course
of
these
essays
i
have
defined
in
spite
of
my
horror
of
definitions
my
own
position
with
regard
to
the
problem
that
i
have
been
examining
but
i
know
there
will
always
be
some
dissatisfied
reader
educated
in
some
dogmatism
or
other
who
will
say
this
man
comes
to
no
conclusion
he
vacillates
now
he
seems
to
affirm
one
thing
and
then
its
contrary
he
is
full
of
contradictions
i
label
him
what
is
he
just
this
one
who
affirms
contraries
a
man
of
contradiction
and
strife
as
jeremiah
said
of
himself
one
who
says
one
thing
with
his
heart
and
the
contrary
with
his
head
and
for
whom
this
conflict
is
the
very
stuff
of
life
and
that
is
as
clear
as
the
water
that
flows
from
the
melted
snow
upon
the
mountain
tops
i
shall
be
told
that
this
is
an
untenable
position
that
a
foundation
must
be
laid
upon
which
to
build
our
action
and
our
works
that
it
is
impossible
to
live
by
contradictions
that
unity
and
clarity
are
essential
conditions
of
life
and
thought
and
that
it
is
necessary
to
unify
thought
and
this
leaves
us
as
we
were
before
for
it
is
precisely
this
inner
contradiction
that
unifies
my
life
and
gives
it
its
practical
purpose
or
rather
it
is
the
conflict
itself
it
is
this
passionate
uncertainty
that
unifies
my
action
and
makes
me
live
and
work
we
think
in
order
that
we
may
live
i
have
said
but
perhaps
it
were
more
correct
to
say
that
we
think
because
we
live
and
the
form
of
our
thought
corresponds
with
that
of
our
life
once
more
i
must
repeat
that
our
ethical
and
philosophical
doctrines
in
general
are
usually
merely
the
justification
of
our
conduct
of
our
actions
our
doctrines
are
usually
the
means
we
seek
in
order
to
explain
and
justify
to
others
and
to
ourselves
our
own
mode
of
action
and
this
be
it
observed
not
merely
for
others
but
for
ourselves
the
man
who
does
not
really
know
why
he
acts
as
he
does
and
not
otherwise
feels
the
necessity
of
explaining
to
himself
the
motive
of
his
action
and
so
he
forges
a
motive
what
we
believe
to
be
the
motives
of
our
conduct
are
usually
but
the
pretexts
for
it
the
very
same
reason
which
one
man
may
regard
as
a
motive
for
taking
care
to
prolong
his
life
may
be
regarded
by
another
man
as
a
motive
for
shooting
himself
nevertheless
it
can
not
be
denied
that
reasons
ideas
have
an
influence
upon
human
actions
and
sometimes
even
determine
them
by
a
process
analogous
to
that
of
suggestion
upon
a
hypnotized
person
and
this
is
so
because
of
the
tendency
in
every
idea
to
resolve
itself
into
action
an
idea
being
simply
an
inchoate
or
abortive
act
it
was
this
notion
that
suggested
to
fouillée
his
theory
of
but
ordinarily
ideas
are
forces
which
we
accommodate
to
other
forces
deeper
and
much
less
conscious
but
putting
all
this
aside
for
the
present
what
i
wish
to
establish
is
that
uncertainty
doubt
perpetual
wrestling
with
the
mystery
of
our
final
destiny
mental
despair
and
the
lack
of
any
solid
and
stable
dogmatic
foundation
may
be
the
basis
of
an
ethic
he
who
bases
or
thinks
that
he
bases
his
conduct
his
inward
or
his
outward
conduct
his
feeling
or
his
action
upon
a
dogma
or
theoretical
principle
which
he
deems
incontrovertible
runs
the
risk
of
becoming
a
fanatic
and
moreover
the
moment
that
this
dogma
is
weakened
or
shattered
the
morality
based
upon
it
gives
way
if
the
earth
that
he
thought
firm
begins
to
rock
he
himself
trembles
at
the
earthquake
for
we
do
not
all
come
up
to
the
standard
of
the
ideal
stoic
who
remains
undaunted
among
the
ruins
of
a
world
shattered
into
atoms
happily
the
stuff
that
is
underneath
a
man
ideas
will
save
him
for
if
a
man
should
tell
you
that
he
does
not
defraud
or
cuckold
his
best
friend
only
because
he
is
afraid
of
hell
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
neither
would
he
do
so
even
if
he
were
to
cease
to
believe
in
hell
but
that
he
would
invent
some
other
excuse
instead
and
this
is
all
to
the
honour
of
the
human
race
but
he
who
believes
that
he
is
sailing
perhaps
without
a
set
course
on
an
unstable
and
sinkable
raft
must
not
be
dismayed
if
the
raft
gives
way
beneath
his
feet
and
threatens
to
sink
such
a
one
thinks
that
he
acts
not
because
he
deems
his
principle
of
action
to
be
true
but
in
order
to
make
it
true
in
order
to
prove
its
truth
in
order
to
create
his
own
spiritual
world
my
conduct
must
be
the
best
proof
the
moral
proof
of
my
supreme
desire
and
if
i
do
not
end
by
convincing
myself
within
the
bounds
of
the
ultimate
and
irremediable
uncertainty
of
the
truth
of
what
i
hope
for
it
is
because
my
conduct
is
not
sufficiently
pure
virtue
therefore
is
not
based
upon
dogma
but
dogma
upon
virtue
and
it
is
not
faith
that
creates
martyrs
but
martyrs
who
create
faith
there
is
no
security
or
repose
so
far
as
security
and
repose
are
obtainable
in
this
life
so
essentially
insecure
and
unreposeful
save
in
conduct
that
is
passionately
good
conduct
practice
is
the
proof
of
doctrine
theory
if
any
man
will
do
his
will
the
will
of
him
that

he
shall
know

it

johann
jakob
moser
the
pietist
was
of
the
opinion
that
no
atheist
or
naturalist
had
the
right
to
regard
the
christian
religion
as
void
of
truth
so
long
as
he
had
not
put
it
to
the
proof
by
keeping
its
precepts
and
commandments
ritschl
des
book
what
is
our
heart
truth
though
it
be
the
immortality
of
the
human
soul
the
truth
of
the
persistence
of
our
consciousness
without
any
termination
whatsoever
the
truth
of
the
human
finality
of
the
universe
and
what
is
its
moral
proof
we
may
formulate
it
thus
act
so
that
in
your
own
judgement
and
in
the
judgement
of
others
you
may
merit
eternity
act
so
that
you
may
become
irreplaceable
act
so
that
you
may
not
merit
death
or
perhaps
thus
act
as
if
you
were
to
die
but
to
die
in
order
to
survive
and
be
eternalized
the
end
of
morality
is
to
give
personal
human
finality
to
the
universe
to
discover
the
finality
that
belongs
to
it
if
indeed
it
has
any
finality
and
to
discover
it
by
acting
more
than
a
century
ago
in
in
letter
xc
of
that
series
that
constitutes
the
immense
monody
of
his
sénancour
wrote
the
words
which
i
have
put
at
the
head
of
this
chapter
and
of
all
the
spiritual
descendants
of
the
patriarchal
rousseau
sénancour
was
the
most
profound
and
the
most
intense
of
all
the
men
of
heart
and
feeling
that
france
has
produced
not
excluding
pascal
he
was
the
most
tragic
man
is
perishable
that
may
be
but
let
us
perish
resisting
and
if
it
is
nothingness
that
awaits
us
do
not
let
us
so
act
that
it
shall
be
a
just
fate
change
this
sentence
from
its
negative
to
the
positive
form
and
if
it
is
nothingness
that
awaits
us
let
us
so
act
that
it
shall
be
an
unjust
fate
and
you
get
the
firmest
basis
of
action
for
the
man
who
can
not
or
will
not
be
a
dogmatist
that
which
is
irreligious
and
demoniacal
that
which
incapacitates
us
for
action
and
leaves
us
without
any
ideal
defence
against
our
evil
tendencies
is
the
pessimism
that
goethe
puts
into
the
mouth
of
mephistopheles
when
he
makes
him
say
all
that
has
achieved
existence
deserves
to
be
destroyed
alles
was
ensteht
ist
wert
doss
es
zugrunde
this
is
the
pessimism
which
we
men
call
evil
and
not
that
other
pessimism
that
consists
in
lamenting
what
it
fears
to
be
true
and
struggling
against
this
fear
namely
that
everything
is
doomed
to
annihilation
in
the
end
mephistopheles
asserts
that
everything
that
exists
deserves
to
be
destroyed
annihilated
but
not
that
everything
will
be
destroyed
or
annihilated
and
we
assert
that
everything
that
exists
deserves
to
be
exalted
and
eternalized
even
though
no
such
fate
is
in
store
for
it
the
moral
attitude
is
the
reverse
of
this
yes
everything
deserves
to
be
eternalized
absolutely
everything
even
evil
itself
for
that
which
we
call
evil
would
lose
its
evilness
in
being
eternalized
because
it
would
lose
its
temporal
nature
for
the
essence
of
evil
consists
in
its
temporal
nature
in
its
not
applying
itself
to
any
ultimate
and
permanent
end
and
it
might
not
be
superfluous
here
to
say
something
about
that
distinction
more
overlaid
with
confusion
than
any
other
between
what
we
are
accustomed
to
call
optimism
and
pessimism
a
confusion
not
less
than
that
which
exists
with
regard
to
the
distinction
between
individualism
and
socialism
indeed
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
form
a
clear
idea
as
to
what
pessimism
really
is
i
have
just
this
very
day
read
in
the
july
an
article
entitled
a
dramatic
inferno
that
deals
with
an
english
translation
of
the
works
of
strindberg
and
it
opens
with
the
following
judicious
observations
if
there
were
in
the
world
a
sincere
and
total
pessimism
it
would
of
necessity
be
silent
the
despair
which
finds
a
voice
is
a
social
mood
it
is
the
cry
of
misery
which
brother
utters
to
brother
when
both
are
stumbling
through
a
valley
of
shadows
which
is
peopled
with
comrades
in
its
anguish
it
bears
witness
to
something
that
is
good
in
life
for
it
presupposes
sympathy
the
real
gloom
the
sincere
despair
is
dumb
and
blind
it
writes
no
books
and
feels
no
impulse
to
burden
an
intolerable
universe
with
a
monument
more
lasting
than
brass
doubtless
there
is
something
of
sophistry
in
this
criticism
for
the
man
who
is
really
in
pain
weeps
and
even
cries
aloud
even
if
he
is
alone
and
there
is
nobody
to
hear
him
simply
as
a
means
of
alleviating
his
pain
although
this
perhaps
may
be
a
result
of
social
habits
but
does
not
the
lion
alone
in
the
desert
roar
if
he
has
an
aching
tooth
but
apart
from
this
it
can
not
be
denied
that
there
is
a
substance
of
truth
underlying
these
remarks
the
pessimism
that
protests
and
defends
itself
can
not
be
truly
said
to
be
pessimism
and
in
truth
still
less
is
it
pessimism
to
hold
that
nothing
ought
to
perish
although
all
things
may
be
doomed
to
annihilation
while
on
the
other
hand
it
is
pessimism
to
affirm
that
all
things
ought
to
be
annihilated
even
though
nothing
may
perish
pessimism
moreover
may
possess
different
values
there
is
a
eudemonistic
or
economic
pessimism
that
which
denies
happiness
there
is
an
ethical
pessimism
that
which
denies
the
triumph
of
moral
good
and
there
is
a
religious
pessimism
that
which
despairs
of
the
human
finality
of
the
universe
of
the
eternal
salvation
of
the
individual
soul
all
men
deserve
to
be
saved
but
as
i
have
said
in
the
previous
chapter
he
above
all
deserves
immortality
who
desires
it
passionately
and
even
in
the
face
of
reason
an
english
writer
wells
who
has
taken
upon
himself
the
rôle
of
the
prophet
a
thing
not
uncommon
in
his
country
tells
us
in
that
active
and
capable
men
of
all
forms
of
religious
profession
tend
in
practice
to
disregard
the
question
of
immortality
altogether
and
this
is
because
the
religious
professions
of
these
active
and
capable
men
to
whom
wells
refers
are
usually
simply
a
lie
and
their
lives
are
a
lie
too
if
they
seek
to
base
them
upon
religion
but
it
may
be
that
at
bottom
there
is
not
so
much
truth
in
what
wells
asserts
as
he
and
others
imagine
these
active
and
capable
men
live
in
the
midst
of
a
society
imbued
with
christian
principles
surrounded
by
institutions
and
social
feelings
that
are
the
product
of
christianity
and
faith
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
exists
deep
down
in
their
own
souls
like
a
subterranean
river
neither
seen
nor
heard
but
watering
the
roots
of
their
deeds
and
their
motives
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
exists
in
truth
no
more
solid
foundation
for
morality
than
the
foundation
of
the
catholic
ethic
the
end
of
man
is
eternal
happiness
which
consists
in
the
vision
and
enjoyment
of
god
sæcula
where
it
errs
however
is
in
the
choice
of
the
means
conducive
to
this
end
for
to
make
the
attainment
of
eternal
happiness
dependent
upon
believing
or
not
believing
in
the
procession
of
the
holy
ghost
from
the
father
and
the
son
and
not
from
the
father
alone
or
in
the
divinity
of
jesus
or
in
the
theory
of
the
hypostatic
union
or
even
in
the
existence
of
god
is
as
a
moment
reflection
will
show
nothing
less
than
monstrous
a
human
god
and
that
is
the
only
kind
of
god
we
are
able
to
conceive
would
never
reject
him
who
was
unable
to
believe
in
him
with
his
head
and
it
is
not
in
his
head
but
in
his
heart
that
the
wicked
man
says
that
there
is
no
god
which
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
he
wishes
that
there
may
not
be
a
god
if
any
belief
could
be
bound
up
with
the
attainment
of
eternal
happiness
it
would
be
the
belief
in
this
happiness
itself
and
in
the
possibility
of
it
and
what
shall
we
say
of
that
other
proposition
of
the
king
of
pedants
to
the
effect
that
we
have
not
come
into
the
world
to
be
happy
but
to
fulfil
our
duty
sind
nicht
auf
der
welt
um
glücklich
zu
sein
sondern
um
unsere
schuldigkeit
zu
if
we
are
in
the
world
something
whence
can
this
be
derived
but
from
the
very
essence
of
our
own
will
which
asks
for
happiness
and
not
duty
as
the
ultimate
end
and
if
it
is
sought
to
attribute
some
other
value
to
this
an
objective
value
as
some
sadducean
pedant
would
say
then
it
must
be
recognized
that
the
objective
reality
that
which
would
remain
even
though
humanity
should
disappear
is
as
indifferent
to
our
duty
as
to
our
happiness
is
as
little
concerned
with
our
morality
as
with
our
felicity
i
am
not
aware
that
jupiter
uranus
or
sirius
would
allow
their
course
to
be
affected
by
the
fact
that
we
are
or
are
not
fulfilling
our
duty
any
more
than
by
the
fact
that
we
are
or
are
not
happy
such
considerations
must
appear
to
these
pedants
to
be
characterized
by
a
ridiculous
vulgarity
and
a
dilettante
superficiality
the
intellectual
world
is
divided
into
two
classes
dilettanti
on
the
one
hand
and
pedants
on
the
other
what
choice
then
have
we
the
modern
man
is
he
who
resigns
himself
to
the
truth
and
is
content
to
be
ignorant
of
the
synthesis
of
culture
witness
what
windelband
says
on
this
head
in
his
study
of
the
fate
of
hölderlin
yes
these
men
of
culture
are
resigned
but
there
remain
a
few
poor
savages
like
ourselves
for
whom
resignation
is
impossible
we
do
not
resign
ourselves
to
the
idea
of
having
one
day
to
disappear
and
the
criticism
of
the
great
pedant
does
not
console
us
the
quintessence
of
common
sense
was
expressed
by
galileo
galilei
when
he
said
some
perhaps
will
say
that
the
bitterest
pain
is
the
loss
of
life
but
i
say
that
there
are
others
more
bitter
for
whosoever
is
deprived
of
life
is
deprived
at
the
same
time
of
the
power
to
lament
not
only
this
but
any
other
loss
whatsoever
whether
galileo
was
conscious
or
not
of
the
humour
of
this
sentence
i
do
not
know
but
it
is
a
tragic
humour
but
to
turn
back
i
repeat
that
if
the
attainment
of
eternal
happiness
could
be
bound
up
with
any
particular
belief
it
would
be
with
the
belief
in
the
possibility
of
its
realization
and
yet
strictly
speaking
not
even
with
this
the
reasonable
man
says
in
his
head
there
is
no
other
life
after
this
but
only
the
wicked
says
it
in
his
heart
but
since
the
wicked
man
is
possibly
only
a
man
who
has
been
driven
to
despair
will
a
human
god
condemn
him
because
of
his
despair
his
despair
alone
is
misfortune
enough
but
in
any
event
let
us
adopt
the
calderónian
formula
in
vida
es
estoy
soñando
y
que
quiero
obrar
hacer
bien
pues
no
se
pierde
el
hacer
bien
aun
en
but
are
good
deeds
really
not
lost
did
calderón
know
and
he
added
a
lo
eterno
que
es
la
fama
vividora
donde
ni
duermen
las
dichas
no
las
grandezas
is
it
really
so
did
calderón
know
calderón
had
faith
robust
catholic
faith
but
for
him
who
lacks
faith
for
him
who
can
not
believe
in
what
don
pedro
calderón
de
la
barca
believed
there
always
remains
the
attitude
of
if
it
is
nothingness
that
awaits
us
let
us
make
an
injustice
of
it
let
us
fight
against
destiny
even
though
without
hope
of
victory
let
us
fight
against
it
quixotically
and
not
only
do
we
fight
against
destiny
in
longing
for
what
is
irrational
but
in
acting
in
such
a
way
that
we
make
ourselves
irreplaceable
in
impressing
our
seal
and
mark
upon
others
in
acting
upon
our
neighbours
in
order
to
dominate
them
in
giving
ourselves
to
them
in
order
that
we
may
eternalize
ourselves
so
far
as
we
can
our
greatest
endeavour
must
be
to
make
ourselves
irreplaceable
to
make
the
theoretical
fact
if
this
expression
does
not
involve
a
contradiction
in
terms
the
fact
that
each
one
of
us
is
unique
and
irreplaceable
that
no
one
else
can
fill
the
gap
that
will
be
left
when
we
die
a
practical
truth
for
in
fact
each
man
is
unique
and
irreplaceable
there
can
not
be
any
other
i
each
one
of
us
our
soul
that
is
not
our
life
is
worth
the
whole
universe
i
say
the
spirit
and
not
the
life
for
the
ridiculously
exaggerated
value
which
those
attach
to
human
life
who
not
really
believing
in
the
spirit
that
is
to
say
in
their
personal
immortality
tirade
against
war
and
the
death
penalty
for
example
is
a
value
which
they
attach
to
it
precisely
because
they
do
not
really
believe
in
the
spirit
of
which
life
is
the
servant
for
life
is
of
use
only
in
so
far
as
it
serves
its
lord
and
master
spirit
and
if
the
master
perishes
with
the
servant
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
is
of
any
great
value
and
to
act
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
our
annihilation
an
injustice
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
our
brothers
our
sons
and
our
brothers
sons
and
their
sons
sons
feel
that
we
ought
not
to
have
died
is
something
that
is
within
the
reach
of
all
the
essence
of
the
doctrine
of
the
christian
redemption
is
in
the
fact
that
he
who
suffered
agony
and
death
was
the
unique
man
that
is
man
the
son
of
man
or
the
son
of
god
that
he
because
he
was
sinless
did
not
deserve
to
have
died
and
that
this
propitiatory
divine
victim
died
in
order
that
he
might
rise
again
and
that
he
might
raise
us
up
from
the
dead
in
order
that
he
might
deliver
us
from
death
by
applying
his
merits
to
us
and
showing
us
the
way
of
life
and
the
christ
who
gave
himself
for
his
brothers
in
humanity
with
an
absolute
is
the
pattern
for
our
action
to
shape
itself
on
all
of
us
each
one
of
us
can
and
ought
to
determine
to
give
as
much
of
himself
as
he
possibly
can
nay
to
give
more
than
he
can
to
exceed
himself
to
go
beyond
himself
to
make
himself
irreplaceable
to
give
himself
to
others
in
order
that
he
may
receive
himself
back
again
from
them
and
each
one
in
his
own
civil
calling
or
office
the
word
office
means
obligation
debt
but
in
the
concrete
and
that
is
what
it
always
ought
to
mean
in
practice
we
ought
not
so
much
to
try
to
seek
that
particular
calling
which
we
think
most
fitting
and
suitable
for
ourselves
as
to
make
a
calling
of
that
employment
in
which
chance
providence
or
our
own
will
has
placed
us
perhaps
luther
rendered
no
greater
service
to
christian
civilization
than
that
of
establishing
the
religious
value
of
the
civil
occupation
of
shattering
the
monastic
and
medieval
idea
of
the
religious
calling
an
idea
involved
in
the
mist
of
human
passions
and
imaginations
and
the
cause
of
terrible
life
tragedies
if
we
could
but
enter
into
the
cloister
and
examine
the
religious
vocation
of
those
whom
the
of
their
parents
had
forced
as
children
into
a
cell
and
who
had
suddenly
awakened
to
the
life
of
the
world
if
indeed
they
ever
do
awake
or
of
those
whom
their
own
had
led
into
it
luther
saw
this
life
of
the
cloister
at
close
quarters
and
suffered
it
himself
and
therefore
he
was
able
to
understand
and
feel
the
religious
value
of
the
civil
calling
to
which
no
man
is
bound
by
perpetual
vows
all
that
the
apostle
said
in
the
fourth
chapter
of
his
epistle
to
the
ephesians
with
regard
to
the
respective
functions
of
christians
in
the
church
must
be
transferred
and
applied
to
the
civil
or
life
for
among
ourselves
the
christian
whether
he
know
it
or
not
and
whether
he
like
it
or
not
is
the
citizen
and
just
as
the
apostle
exclaimed
i
am
a
roman
citizen
each
one
of
us
even
the
atheist
might
exclaim
i
am
a
christian
and
this
demands
the
in
the
sense
of
of
christianity
which
was
luther
task
although
he
himself
eventually
became
the
founder
of
a
church
there
is
a
common
english
phrase
the
right
man
in
the
right
place
to
which
we
might
rejoin
cobbler
to
thy
last
who
knows
what
is
the
post
that
suits
him
best
and
for
which
he
is
most
fitted
does
a
man
himself
know
it
better
than
others
or
do
they
know
it
better
than
he
who
can
measure
capacities
and
aptitudes
the
religious
attitude
undoubtedly
is
to
endeavour
to
make
the
occupation
in
which
we
find
ourselves
our
vocation
and
only
in
the
last
resort
to
change
it
for
another
this
question
of
the
proper
vocation
is
possibly
the
gravest
and
most
of
social
problems
that
which
is
at
the
root
of
all
the
others
that
which
is
known
as
the
social
question
is
perhaps
not
so
much
a
problem
of
the
distribution
of
wealth
of
the
products
of
labour
as
a
problem
of
the
distribution
of
avocations
of
the
modes
of
production
it
is
not
aptitude
a
thing
impossible
to
ascertain
without
first
putting
it
to
the
test
and
not
always
clearly
indicated
in
a
man
for
with
regard
to
the
majority
of
callings
a
man
is
not
born
but
made
it
is
not
special
aptitude
but
rather
social
political
and
customary
reasons
that
determine
a
man
occupation
at
certain
times
and
in
certain
countries
it
is
caste
and
heredity
at
other
times
and
in
other
places
the
guild
or
corporation
in
later
times
machinery
in
almost
all
cases
necessity
liberty
scarcely
ever
and
the
tragedy
of
it
culminates
in
those
occupations
pandering
to
evil
in
which
the
soul
is
sacrificed
for
the
sake
of
the
livelihood
in
which
the
workman
works
with
the
consciousness
not
of
the
uselessness
merely
but
of
the
social
perversity
of
his
work
manufacturing
the
poison
that
will
kill
him
the
weapon
perchance
with
which
his
children
will
be
murdered
this
and
not
the
question
of
wages
is
the
gravest
problem
i
shall
never
forget
a
scene
of
which
i
was
a
witness
that
took
place
on
the
banks
of
the
river
that
flows
through
bilbao
my
native
town
a
workman
was
hammering
at
something
in
a
shipwright
yard
working
without
putting
his
heart
into
his
work
as
if
he
lacked
energy
or
worked
merely
for
the
sake
of
getting
a
wage
when
suddenly
a
voice
was
heard
crying
help
help
a
child
had
fallen
into
the
river
instantly
the
man
was
transformed
with
an
admirable
energy
promptitude
and
he
threw
off
his
clothes
and
plunged
into
the
water
to
rescue
the
drowning
infant
possibly
the
reason
why
there
is
less
bitterness
in
the
agrarian
socialist
movement
than
in
that
of
the
towns
is
that
the
field
labourer
although
his
wages
and
his
standard
of
living
are
no
better
than
those
of
the
miner
or
artisan
has
a
clearer
consciousness
of
the
social
value
of
his
work
sowing
corn
is
a
different
thing
from
extracting
diamonds
from
the
earth
and
it
may
be
that
the
greatest
social
progress
consists
in
a
certain
indifferentiation
of
labour
in
the
facility
for
exchanging
one
kind
of
work
for
another
and
that
other
not
perhaps
a
more
lucrative
but
a
nobler
one
for
there
are
degrees
of
nobility
in
labour
but
unhappily
it
is
only
too
seldom
that
a
man
who
keeps
to
one
occupation
without
changing
is
concerned
with
making
a
religious
vocation
of
it
or
that
the
man
who
changes
his
occupation
for
another
does
so
from
any
religious
motive
and
do
you
not
know
cases
in
which
a
man
justifying
his
action
on
the
ground
that
the
professional
organism
to
which
he
belongs
and
in
which
he
works
is
badly
organized
and
does
not
function
as
it
ought
will
evade
the
strict
performance
of
his
duty
on
the
pretext
that
he
is
thereby
fulfilling
a
higher
duty
is
not
this
insistence
upon
the
literal
carrying
out
of
orders
called
disciplinarianism
and
do
not
people
speak
disparagingly
of
bureaucracy
and
the
pharisaism
of
public
officials
and
cases
occur
not
unlike
that
of
an
intelligent
and
studious
military
officer
who
should
discover
the
deficiencies
of
his
country
military
organization
and
denounce
them
to
his
superiors
and
perhaps
to
the
public
thereby
fulfilling
his
duty
and
who
when
on
active
service
should
refuse
to
carry
out
an
operation
which
he
was
ordered
to
undertake
believing
that
there
was
but
scant
probability
of
success
or
rather
certainty
of
failure
so
long
as
these
deficiencies
remained
unremedied
he
would
deserve
to
be
shot
and
as
for
this
question
of
pharisaism
and
there
is
always
a
way
of
obeying
an
order
while
yet
retaining
the
command
a
way
of
carrying
out
what
one
believes
to
be
an
absurd
operation
while
correcting
its
absurdity
even
though
it
involve
own
death
when
in
my
bureaucratic
capacity
i
have
come
across
some
legislative
ordinance
that
has
fallen
into
desuetude
because
of
its
manifest
absurdity
i
have
always
endeavoured
to
apply
it
there
is
nothing
worse
than
a
loaded
pistol
which
nobody
uses
left
lying
in
some
corner
of
the
house
a
child
finds
it
begins
to
play
with
it
and
kills
its
own
father
laws
that
have
fallen
into
desuetude
are
the
most
terrible
of
all
laws
when
the
cause
of
the
desuetude
is
the
badness
of
the
law
and
these
are
not
groundless
suppositions
and
least
of
all
in
our
country
for
there
are
many
who
while
they
go
about
looking
out
for
i
know
not
what
ideal
that
is
to
say
fictitious
duties
and
responsibilities
neglect
the
duty
of
putting
their
whole
soul
into
the
immediate
and
concrete
business
which
furnishes
them
with
a
living
and
the
rest
the
immense
majority
perform
their
task
perfunctorily
merely
for
the
sake
of
nominally
complying
with
their
duty
a
terribly
immoral
phrase
in
order
to
get
themselves
out
of
a
difficulty
to
get
the
job
done
to
qualify
for
their
wages
without
earning
them
whether
these
wages
be
pecuniary
or
otherwise
here
you
have
a
shoemaker
who
lives
by
making
shoes
and
makes
them
with
just
enough
care
and
attention
to
keep
his
clientèle
together
without
losing
custom
another
shoemaker
lives
on
a
somewhat
higher
spiritual
plane
for
he
has
a
proper
love
for
his
work
and
out
of
pride
or
a
sense
of
honour
strives
for
the
reputation
of
being
the
best
shoemaker
in
the
town
or
in
the
kingdom
even
though
this
reputation
brings
him
no
increase
of
custom
or
profit
but
only
renown
and
prestige
but
there
is
a
still
higher
degree
of
moral
perfection
in
this
business
of
shoemaking
and
that
is
for
the
shoemaker
to
aspire
to
become
for
his
the
one
and
only
shoemaker
indispensable
and
irreplaceable
the
shoemaker
who
looks
after
their
footgear
so
well
that
they
will
feel
a
definite
loss
when
he
dies
when
he
is
dead
to
them
not
merely
dead
and
they
will
feel
that
he
ought
not
to
have
died
and
this
will
result
from
the
fact
that
in
working
for
them
he
was
anxious
to
spare
them
any
discomfort
and
to
make
sure
that
it
should
not
be
any
preoccupation
with
their
feet
that
should
prevent
them
from
being
at
leisure
to
contemplate
the
higher
truths
he
shod
them
for
the
love
of
them
and
for
the
love
of
god
in
them
he
shod
them
religiously
i
have
chosen
this
example
deliberately
although
it
may
perhaps
appear
to
you
somewhat
pedestrian
for
the
fact
is
that
in
this
business
of
shoemaking
the
religious
as
opposed
to
the
ethical
sense
is
at
a
very
low
ebb
working
men
group
themselves
in
associations
they
form
societies
and
unions
for
defence
they
fight
very
justly
and
nobly
for
the
betterment
of
their
class
but
it
is
not
clear
that
these
associations
have
any
great
influence
on
their
moral
attitude
towards
their
work
they
have
succeeded
in
compelling
employers
to
employ
only
such
workmen
and
no
others
as
the
respective
unions
shall
designate
in
each
particular
case
but
in
the
selection
of
those
designated
they
pay
little
heed
to
their
technical
fitness
often
the
employer
finds
it
almost
impossible
to
dismiss
an
inefficient
workman
on
account
of
his
inefficiency
for
his
take
his
part
their
work
moreover
is
often
perfunctory
performed
merely
as
a
pretext
for
receiving
a
wage
and
instances
even
occur
when
they
deliberately
mishandle
it
in
order
to
injure
their
employer
in
attempting
to
justify
this
state
of
things
it
may
be
said
that
the
employers
are
a
hundred
times
more
blameworthy
than
the
workmen
for
they
are
not
concerned
to
give
a
better
wage
to
the
man
who
does
better
work
or
to
foster
the
general
education
and
technical
proficiency
of
the
workman
or
to
ensure
the
intrinsic
goodness
of
the
article
produced
the
improvement
of
the
product
which
apart
from
reasons
of
industrial
and
mercantile
competition
ought
to
be
in
itself
and
for
the
good
of
the
consumers
for
charity
sake
the
chief
end
of
the
business
is
not
so
regarded
either
by
employers
or
employed
and
this
is
because
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
have
any
religious
sense
of
their
social
function
neither
of
them
seek
to
make
themselves
irreplaceable
the
evil
is
aggravated
when
the
business
takes
the
unhappy
form
of
the
impersonal
limited
company
for
where
there
is
no
longer
any
personal
signature
there
is
no
longer
any
of
that
pride
which
seeks
to
give
the
signature
prestige
a
pride
which
in
its
way
is
a
substitute
for
the
craving
for
eternalization
with
the
disappearance
of
the
concrete
individuality
the
basis
of
all
religion
the
religious
sense
of
the
business
calling
disappears
also
and
what
has
been
said
of
employers
and
workmen
applies
still
more
to
members
of
the
liberal
professions
and
public
functionaries
there
is
scarcely
a
single
servant
of
the
state
who
feels
the
religious
bearing
of
his
official
and
public
duties
nothing
could
be
more
unsatisfactory
nothing
more
confused
than
the
feeling
among
our
people
with
regard
to
their
duties
towards
the
state
and
this
sense
of
duty
is
still
further
obliterated
by
the
attitude
of
the
catholic
church
whose
action
so
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
is
in
strict
truth
anarchical
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
to
find
among
its
ministers
upholders
of
the
moral
lawfulness
of
smuggling
and
contraband
as
if
in
disobeying
the
legally
constituted
authority
the
smuggler
and
contrabandist
did
not
sin
against
the
fourth
commandment
of
the
law
of
god
which
in
commanding
us
to
honour
our
father
and
mother
commands
us
to
obey
all
lawful
authority
in
so
far
as
the
ordinances
of
such
authority
are
not
contrary
and
the
levying
of
these
contributions
is
certainly
not
contrary
to
the
law
of
god
there
are
many
who
since
it
is
written
in
the
sweat
of
thy
face
shalt
thou
eat
bread
regard
work
as
a
punishment
and
therefore
they
attribute
merely
an
or
at
best
an
esthetic
value
to
the
work
of
everyday
life
for
those
who
take
this
view
and
it
is
the
view
principally
held
by
the
jesuits
the
business
of
life
is
twofold
there
is
the
inferior
and
transitory
business
of
winning
a
livelihood
of
winning
bread
for
ourselves
and
our
children
in
an
honourable
manner
and
the
elasticity
of
this
honour
is
well
known
and
there
is
the
grand
business
of
our
salvation
of
winning
eternal
glory
this
inferior
or
worldly
business
is
to
be
undertaken
not
only
so
as
to
permit
us
without
deceiving
or
seriously
injuring
our
neighbours
to
live
decently
in
accordance
with
our
social
position
but
also
so
as
to
afford
us
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
time
for
attending
to
the
other
main
business
of
our
life
and
there
are
others
who
rising
somewhat
above
this
conception
of
the
work
of
our
civil
occupation
a
conception
which
is
economical
rather
than
ethical
attain
to
an
esthetic
conception
and
sense
of
it
and
this
involves
endeavouring
to
acquire
distinction
and
renown
in
our
occupation
the
converting
of
it
into
an
art
for
art
sake
for
beauty
sake
but
it
is
necessary
to
rise
still
higher
than
this
to
attain
to
an
ethical
sense
of
our
civil
calling
to
a
sense
which
derives
from
our
religious
sense
from
our
hunger
of
eternalization
to
work
at
our
ordinary
civil
occupation
with
eyes
fixed
on
god
for
the
love
of
god
which
is
equivalent
to
saying
for
the
love
of
our
eternalization
is
to
make
of
this
work
a
work
of
religion
that
saying
in
the
sweat
of
thy
face
shalt
thou
eat
bread
does
not
mean
that
god
condemned
man
to
work
but
to
the
painfulness
of
it
it
would
have
been
no
condemnation
to
have
condemned
man
to
work
itself
for
work
is
the
only
practical
consolation
for
having
been
born
and
for
a
christian
the
proof
that
god
did
not
condemn
man
to
work
itself
consists
in
the
saying
of
the
scripture
that
before
the
fall
while
he
was
still
in
a
state
of
innocence
god
took
man
and
put
him
in
the
garden
to
dress
it
and
to
keep
it
ii
and
how
in
fact
would
man
have
passed
his
time
in
paradise
if
he
had
had
no
work
to
do
in
keeping
it
in
order
and
may
it
not
be
that
the
beatific
vision
itself
is
a
kind
of
work
and
even
if
work
were
our
punishment
we
ought
to
strive
to
make
it
the
punishment
itself
our
consolation
and
our
redemption
and
if
we
must
needs
embrace
some
cross
or
other
there
is
for
each
one
of
us
no
better
cross
than
the
cross
of
our
own
civil
calling
for
christ
did
not
say
take
up
my
cross
and
follow
me
but
take
up
thy
cross
and
follow
me
every
man
his
own
cross
for
the
saviour
cross
the
saviour
alone
can
bear
and
the
imitation
of
christ
therefore
does
not
consist
in
that
monastic
ideal
so
shiningly
set
forth
in
the
book
that
commonly
bears
the
name
of
à
kempis
an
ideal
only
applicable
to
a
very
limited
number
of
persons
and
therefore
but
to
imitate
christ
is
to
take
up
each
one
his
own
cross
the
cross
of
his
own
civil
occupation
civil
and
not
merely
religions
as
christ
took
up
his
cross
the
cross
of
his
calling
and
to
embrace
it
and
carry
it
looking
towards
god
and
striving
to
make
each
act
of
this
calling
a
true
prayer
in
making
shoes
and
because
he
makes
them
a
man
can
gain
heaven
provided
that
the
shoemaker
strives
to
be
perfect
as
a
shoemaker
as
our
father
in
heaven
is
perfect
fourier
the
socialist
dreamer
dreamed
of
making
work
attractive
in
his
phalansteries
by
the
free
choice
of
vocations
and
in
other
ways
there
is
no
other
way
than
that
of
liberty
wherein
consists
the
charm
of
the
game
of
chance
which
is
a
kind
of
work
if
not
in
the
voluntary
submission
of
the
player
to
the
liberty
of
nature
that
is
to
chance
but
do
not
let
us
lose
ourselves
in
a
comparison
between
work
and
play
and
the
sense
of
making
ourselves
irreplaceable
of
not
meriting
death
of
making
our
annihilation
if
it
is
annihilation
that
awaits
us
an
injustice
ought
to
impel
us
not
only
to
perform
our
own
occupation
religiously
from
love
of
god
and
love
of
our
eternity
and
eternalization
but
to
perform
it
passionately
tragically
if
you
like
it
ought
to
impel
us
to
endeavour
to
stamp
others
with
our
seal
to
perpetuate
ourselves
in
them
and
in
their
children
by
dominating
them
to
leave
on
all
things
the
imperishable
impress
of
our
signature
the
most
fruitful
ethic
is
the
ethic
of
mutual
imposition
above
all
we
must
recast
in
a
positive
form
the
negative
commandments
which
we
have
inherited
from
the
ancient
law
thus
where
it
is
written
thou
shalt
not
lie
let
us
understand
thou
shalt
always
speak
the
truth
in
season
and
out
of
season
although
it
is
we
ourselves
and
not
others
who
are
judges
in
each
case
of
this
seasonableness
and
for
thou
shalt
not
kill
let
us
understand
thou
shalt
give
life
and
increase
it
and
for
thou
shalt
not
steal
let
us
say
thou
shalt
increase
the
general
wealth
and
for
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
thou
shalt
give
children
healthy
strong
and
good
to
thy
country
and
to
heaven
and
thus
with
all
the
other
commandments
he
who
does
not
lose
his
life
shall
not
find
it
give
yourself
then
to
others
but
in
order
to
give
yourself
to
them
first
dominate
them
for
it
is
not
possible
to
dominate
except
by
being
dominated
everyone
nourishes
himself
upon
the
flesh
of
that
which
he
devours
in
order
that
you
may
dominate
your
neighbour
you
must
know
and
love
him
it
is
by
attempting
to
impose
my
ideas
upon
him
that
i
become
the
recipient
of
his
ideas
to
love
my
neighbour
is
to
wish
that
he
may
be
like
me
that
he
may
be
another
i
that
is
to
say
it
is
to
wish
that
i
may
be
he
it
is
to
wish
to
obliterate
the
division
between
him
and
me
to
suppress
the
evil
my
endeavour
to
impose
myself
upon
another
to
be
and
live
in
him
and
by
him
to
make
him
mine
which
is
the
same
as
making
myself
his
is
that
which
gives
religious
meaning
to
human
collectivity
to
human
solidarity
the
feeling
of
solidarity
originates
in
myself
since
i
am
a
society
i
feel
the
need
of
making
myself
master
of
human
society
since
i
am
a
social
product
i
must
socialize
myself
and
from
myself
i
proceed
to
god
who
is
i
projected
to
the
all
and
from
god
to
each
of
my
neighbours
my
immediate
first
impulse
is
to
protest
against
the
inquisitor
and
to
prefer
the
merchant
who
comes
to
offer
me
his
wares
but
when
my
impressions
are
clarified
by
reflection
i
begin
to
see
that
the
inquisitor
when
he
acts
from
a
right
motive
treats
me
as
a
man
as
an
end
in
myself
and
if
he
molests
me
it
is
from
a
charitable
wish
to
save
my
soul
while
the
merchant
on
the
other
hand
regards
me
merely
as
a
customer
as
a
means
to
an
end
and
his
indulgence
and
tolerance
is
at
bottom
nothing
but
a
supreme
indifference
to
my
destiny
there
is
much
more
humanity
in
the
inquisitor
similarly
there
is
much
more
humanity
in
war
than
in
peace
to
evil
implies
resistance
to
good
and
to
take
the
offensive
leaving
the
defensive
out
of
the
question
is
perhaps
the
divinest
thing
in
humanity
war
is
the
school
of
fraternity
and
the
bond
of
love
it
is
war
that
has
brought
peoples
into
touch
with
one
another
by
mutual
aggression
and
collision
and
has
been
the
cause
of
their
knowing
and
loving
one
another
human
love
knows
no
purer
embrace
or
one
more
fruitful
in
its
consequences
than
that
between
victor
and
vanquished
on
the
battlefield
and
even
the
purified
hate
that
springs
from
war
is
fruitful
war
is
in
its
strictest
sense
the
sanctification
of
homicide
cain
is
redeemed
as
a
leader
of
armies
and
if
cain
had
not
killed
his
brother
abel
perhaps
he
would
have
died
by
the
hand
of
abel
god
revealed
himself
above
all
in
war
he
began
by
being
the
god
of
battles
and
one
of
the
greatest
services
of
the
cross
is
that
in
the
form
of
the
it
protects
the
hand
that
wields
the
sword
the
enemies
of
the
state
say
that
cain
the
fratricide
was
the
founder
of
the
state
and
we
must
accept
the
fact
and
turn
it
to
the
glory
of
the
state
the
child
of
war
civilization
began
on
the
day
on
which
one
man
by
subjecting
another
to
his
will
and
compelling
him
to
do
the
work
of
two
was
enabled
to
devote
himself
to
the
contemplation
of
the
world
and
to
set
his
captive
upon
works
of
luxury
it
was
slavery
that
enabled
plato
to
speculate
upon
the
ideal
republic
and
it
was
war
that
brought
slavery
about
not
without
reason
was
athena
the
goddess
of
war
and
of
wisdom
but
is
there
any
need
to
repeat
once
again
these
obvious
truths
which
though
they
have
continually
been
forgotten
are
continually
rediscovered
and
the
supreme
commandment
that
arises
out
of
love
towards
god
and
the
foundation
of
all
morality
is
this
yield
yourself
up
entirely
give
your
spirit
to
the
end
that
you
may
save
it
that
you
may
eternalize
it
such
is
the
sacrifice
of
life
the
individual
individual
the
wretched
captive
of
the
instinct
of
preservation
and
of
the
senses
cares
only
about
preserving
himself
and
all
his
concern
is
that
others
should
not
force
their
way
into
his
sphere
should
not
disturb
him
should
not
interrupt
his
idleness
and
in
return
for
their
abstention
or
for
the
sake
of
example
he
refrains
from
forcing
himself
upon
them
from
interrupting
their
idleness
from
disturbing
them
from
taking
possession
of
them
do
not
do
unto
others
what
you
would
not
have
them
do
unto
you
he
translates
thus
i
do
not
interfere
with
others
let
them
not
interfere
with
me
and
he
shrinks
and
pines
and
perishes
in
this
spiritual
avarice
and
this
repellent
ethic
of
anarchic
individualism
each
one
for
himself
and
as
each
one
is
not
himself
he
can
hardly
live
for
himself
but
as
soon
as
the
individual
feels
himself
in
society
he
feels
himself
in
god
and
kindled
by
the
instinct
of
perpetuation
he
glows
with
love
towards
god
and
with
a
dominating
charity
he
seeks
to
perpetuate
himself
in
others
to
perennialize
his
spirit
to
eternalize
it
to
unnail
god
and
his
sole
desire
is
to
seal
his
spirit
upon
other
spirits
and
to
receive
their
impress
in
return
he
has
shaken
off
the
yoke
of
his
spiritual
sloth
and
avarice
sloth
it
is
said
is
the
mother
of
all
the
vices
and
in
fact
sloth
does
engender
two
vices
avarice
and
envy
which
in
their
turn
are
the
source
of
all
the
rest
sloth
is
the
weight
of
matter
in
itself
inert
within
us
and
this
sloth
while
it
professes
to
preserve
us
by
economizing
our
forces
in
reality
attenuates
us
and
reduces
us
to
nothing
in
man
there
is
either
too
much
matter
or
too
much
spirit
or
to
put
it
better
either
he
feels
a
hunger
for
spirit
that
is
for
eternity
or
he
feels
a
hunger
for
matter
that
is
submission
to
annihilation
when
spirit
is
in
excess
and
he
feels
a
hunger
for
yet
more
of
it
he
pours
it
forth
and
scatters
it
abroad
and
in
scattering
it
abroad
he
amplifies
it
with
that
of
others
and
on
the
contrary
when
a
man
is
avaricious
of
himself
and
thinks
that
he
will
preserve
himself
better
by
withdrawing
within
himself
he
ends
by
losing
all
he
is
like
the
man
who
received
the
single
talent
he
buried
it
in
order
that
he
might
not
lose
it
and
in
the
end
he
was
bereft
of
it
for
to
him
that
hath
shall
be
given
but
from
him
that
hath
but
a
little
shall
be
taken
away
even
the
little
that
he
hath
be
ye
perfect
even
as
your
father
in
heaven
is
perfect
we
are
bidden
and
this
terrible
precept
terrible
because
for
us
the
infinite
perfection
of
the
father
is
unattainable
must
be
our
supreme
rule
of
conduct
unless
a
man
aspires
to
the
impossible
the
possible
that
he
achieves
will
be
scarcely
worth
the
trouble
of
achieving
it
behoves
us
to
aspire
to
the
impossible
to
the
absolute
and
infinite
perfection
and
to
say
to
the
father
father
i
can
not
help
thou
my
impotence
and
he
acting
in
us
will
achieve
it
for
us
and
to
be
perfect
is
to
be
all
it
is
to
be
myself
and
to
be
all
else
it
is
to
be
humanity
it
is
to
be
the
universe
and
there
is
no
other
way
of
being
all
but
to
give
oneself
to
all
and
when
all
shall
be
in
all
all
will
be
in
each
one
of
us
the
apocatastasis
is
more
than
a
mystical
dream
it
is
a
rule
of
action
it
is
a
beacon
beckoning
us
to
high
exploits
and
from
it
springs
the
ethic
of
invasion
of
domination
of
aggression
of
inquisition
if
you
like
for
true
charity
is
a
kind
of
invasion
it
consists
in
putting
my
spirit
into
other
spirits
in
giving
them
my
suffering
as
the
food
and
consolation
for
their
sufferings
in
awakening
their
unrest
with
my
unrest
in
sharpening
their
hunger
for
god
with
my
hunger
for
god
it
is
not
charity
to
rock
and
lull
our
brothers
to
sleep
in
the
inertia
and
drowsiness
of
matter
but
rather
to
awaken
them
to
the
uneasiness
and
torment
of
spirit
to
the
fourteen
works
of
mercy
which
we
learnt
in
the
catechism
of
christian
doctrine
there
should
sometimes
be
added
yet
another
that
of
awakening
the
sleeper
sometimes
at
any
rate
and
surely
when
the
sleeper
sleeps
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
it
is
much
more
merciful
to
awaken
him
than
to
bury
him
after
he
is
dead
let
us
leave
the
dead
to
bury
their
dead
it
has
been
well
said
whosoever
loves
thee
dearly
will
make
thee
weep
and
charity
often
causes
weeping
the
love
that
does
not
mortify
does
not
deserve
so
divine
a
name
said
that
ardent
portuguese
apostle
fr
thomé
de
jesús
who
was
also
the
author
of
this
ejaculation
o
infinite
fire
o
eternal
love
who
weepest
when
thou
hast
naught
to
embrace
and
feed
upon
and
many
hearts
to
burn
he
who
loves
his
neighbour
burns
his
heart
and
the
heart
like
green
wood
in
burning
groans
and
distils
itself
in
tears
and
to
do
this
is
generosity
one
of
the
two
mother
virtues
which
are
born
when
inertia
sloth
is
overcome
most
of
our
miseries
come
from
spiritual
avarice
the
cure
for
suffering
which
as
we
have
said
is
the
collision
of
consciousness
with
unconsciousness
is
not
to
be
submerged
in
unconsciousness
but
to
be
raised
to
consciousness
and
to
suffer
more
the
evil
of
suffering
is
cured
by
more
suffering
by
higher
suffering
do
not
take
opium
but
put
salt
and
vinegar
in
the
soul
wound
for
when
you
sleep
and
no
longer
feel
the
suffering
you
are
not
and
to
be
that
is
imperative
do
not
then
close
your
eyes
to
the
agonizing
sphinx
but
look
her
in
the
face
and
let
her
seize
you
in
her
mouth
and
crunch
you
with
her
hundred
thousand
poisonous
teeth
and
swallow
you
and
when
she
has
swallowed
you
you
will
know
the
sweetness
of
the
taste
of
suffering
the
way
thereto
in
practice
is
by
the
ethic
of
mutual
imposition
men
should
strive
to
impose
themselves
upon
one
another
to
give
their
spirits
to
one
another
to
seal
one
another
souls
there
is
matter
for
thought
in
the
fact
that
the
christian
ethic
has
been
called
an
ethic
of
slaves
by
whom
by
anarchists
it
is
anarchism
that
is
an
ethic
of
slaves
for
it
is
only
the
slave
that
chants
the
praises
of
anarchical
liberty
anarchism
no
but
not
the
creed
of
nor
god
nor
master
but
that
of
all
gods
and
all
masters
all
striving
to
become
gods
to
become
immortal
and
achieving
this
by
dominating
others
and
there
are
so
many
ways
of
dominating
there
is
even
a
passive
way
or
one
at
least
that
is
apparently
passive
of
fulfilling
at
times
this
law
of
life
adaptation
to
environment
imitation
putting
oneself
in
another
place
sympathy
in
a
word
besides
being
a
manifestation
of
the
unity
of
the
species
is
a
mode
of
of
being
another
to
be
conquered
or
at
least
to
seem
to
be
conquered
is
often
to
conquer
to
take
what
is
another
is
a
way
of
living
in
him
and
in
speaking
of
domination
i
do
not
mean
the
domination
of
the
tiger
the
fox
also
dominates
by
cunning
and
the
hare
by
flight
and
the
viper
by
poison
and
the
mosquito
by
its
smallness
and
the
squid
by
the
inky
fluid
with
which
it
darkens
the
water
and
under
cover
of
which
it
escapes
and
no
one
is
scandalized
at
this
for
the
same
universal
father
who
gave
its
fierceness
its
talons
and
its
jaws
to
the
tiger
gave
cunning
to
the
fox
swift
feet
to
the
hare
poison
to
the
viper
diminutiveness
to
the
mosquito
and
its
inky
fluid
to
the
squid
and
nobleness
or
ignobleness
does
not
consist
in
the
weapons
we
use
for
every
species
and
even
every
individual
possesses
its
own
but
rather
in
the
way
in
which
we
use
them
and
above
all
in
the
cause
in
which
we
wield
them
and
among
the
weapons
of
conquest
must
be
included
the
weapon
of
patience
and
of
resignation
but
a
passionate
patience
and
a
passionate
resignation
containing
within
itself
an
active
principle
and
antecedent
longings
you
remember
that
famous
sonnet
of
milton
milton
the
great
fighter
the
great
puritan
disturber
of
the
spiritual
peace
the
singer
of
satan
who
when
he
considered
how
his
light
was
spent
and
that
one
talent
which
it
is
death
to
hide
lodged
with
him
useless
heard
the
voice
of
patience
saying
to
him
god
doth
not
need
either
man
work
or
his
own
gifts
who
best
bear
his
mild
yoke
they
serve
him
best
his
state
is
kingly
thousands
at
his
bidding
speed
and
post
land
and
ocean
without
rest
they
also
serve
who
only
stand
and
wait
they
also
serve
who
only
stand
and
wait
yes
but
it
is
when
they
wait
for
him
passionately
hungeringly
full
of
longing
for
immortality
in
him
and
we
must
impose
ourselves
even
though
it
be
by
our
patience
my
cup
is
small
but
i
drink
out
of
my
cup
said
the
egoistical
poet
of
an
avaricious
people
no
out
of
my
cup
all
drink
for
i
wish
all
to
drink
out
of
it
i
offer
it
to
them
and
my
cup
grows
according
to
the
number
of
those
who
drink
out
of
it
and
all
in
putting
it
to
their
lips
leave
in
it
something
of
their
spirit
and
while
they
drink
out
of
my
cup
i
also
drink
out
of
theirs
for
the
more
i
belong
to
myself
and
the
more
i
am
myself
the
more
i
belong
to
others
out
of
the
fullness
of
myself
i
overflow
upon
my
brothers
and
as
i
overflow
upon
them
they
enter
into
me
be
ye
perfect
as
your
father
is
perfect
we
are
bidden
and
our
father
is
perfect
because
he
is
himself
and
because
he
is
in
each
one
of
his
children
who
live
and
move
and
have
their
being
in
him
and
the
end
of
perfection
is
that
we
all
may
be
one
john
xvii
all
one
body
in
christ
rom
xii
and
that
at
the
last
when
all
things
are
subdued
unto
the
son
the
son
himself
may
be
subject
to
him
that
put
all
things
under
him
that
god
may
be
all
in
all
and
this
is
to
make
the
universe
consciousness
to
make
nature
a
society
and
a
human
society
and
then
shall
we
be
able
confidently
to
call
god
father
i
am
aware
that
those
who
say
that
ethics
is
a
science
will
say
that
all
this
commentary
of
mine
is
nothing
but
rhetoric
but
each
man
has
his
own
language
and
his
own
passion
that
is
to
say
each
man
who
knows
what
passion
is
and
as
for
the
man
who
knows
it
not
nothing
will
it
avail
him
to
know
science
and
the
passion
that
finds
its
expression
in
this
rhetoric
the
devotees
of
ethical
science
call
egotism
but
this
egotism
is
the
only
true
remedy
for
egoism
spiritual
avarice
the
vice
of
preserving
and
reserving
oneself
and
of
not
striving
to
perennialize
oneself
by
giving
oneself
be
not
and
ye
shall
be
mightier
than
all
that
is
said
fr
juan
de
los
angeles
in
one
of
his
de
la
conquista
del
reina
de
but
what
does
this
be
not
mean
may
it
not
mean
paradoxically
and
such
a
mode
of
expression
is
common
with
the
mystics
the
contrary
of
that
which
at
a
first
and
literal
reading
it
would
appear
to
mean
is
not
the
whole
ethic
of
submission
and
quietism
an
immense
paradox
or
rather
a
great
tragic
contradiction
is
not
the
monastic
the
strictly
monastic
ethic
an
absurdity
and
by
the
monastic
ethic
i
mean
that
of
the
solitary
carthusian
that
of
the
hermit
who
flees
from
the
world
perhaps
carrying
it
with
him
nevertheless
in
order
that
he
may
live
quite
alone
with
a
god
who
is
lonely
as
himself
not
that
of
the
dominican
inquisitor
who
scoured
provence
in
search
of
albigensian
hearts
to
burn
let
god
do
it
all
someone
will
say
but
if
man
folds
his
arms
god
will
go
to
sleep
this
carthusian
ethic
and
that
scientific
ethic
which
is
derived
from
ethical
science
oh
this
science
of
ethics
rational
and
rationalistic
ethics
pedantry
of
pedantry
all
is
pedantry
yes
this
perhaps
is
egoism
and
coldness
of
heart
there
are
some
who
say
that
they
isolate
themselves
with
god
in
order
that
they
may
the
better
work
out
their
salvation
their
redemption
but
since
sin
is
collective
redemption
must
be
collective
also
the
religious
is
the
determination
of
the
whole
and
everything
outside
this
is
an
illusion
of
the
senses
and
that
is
why
the
greatest
criminal
is
at
bottom
innocent
a
man
and
a
saint
kierkegaard
cap
sect
are
we
to
understand
on
the
other
hand
that
men
seek
to
gain
the
other
the
eternal
life
by
renouncing
this
the
temporal
life
if
the
other
life
is
anything
it
must
be
a
continuation
of
this
and
only
as
such
a
continuation
more
or
less
purified
is
it
mirrored
in
our
desire
and
if
this
is
so
such
as
is
this
life
of
time
so
will
be
the
life
of
eternity
this
world
and
the
other
are
like
the
two
wives
of
one
husband
if
he
pleases
one
he
makes
the
other
envious
said
an
arab
thinker
quoted
by
windelband
in
vol
ii
of
but
such
a
thought
could
only
have
arisen
in
the
mind
of
one
who
had
failed
to
resolve
the
tragic
conflict
between
his
spirit
and
the
world
in
a
fruitful
warfare
a
practical
contradiction
thy
kingdom
come
to
us
so
christ
taught
us
to
pray
to
the
father
not
may
we
come
to
thy
kingdom
and
according
to
the
primitive
christian
belief
the
eternal
life
was
to
be
realized
on
this
earth
itself
and
as
a
continuation
of
the
earthly
life
we
were
made
men
and
not
angels
in
order
that
we
might
seek
our
happiness
through
the
medium
of
this
life
and
the
christ
of
the
christian
faith
became
not
an
angelic
but
a
human
being
redeeming
us
by
taking
upon
himself
a
real
and
effective
body
and
not
an
appearance
of
one
merely
and
according
to
this
same
faith
even
the
highest
of
the
angelical
hierarchy
adore
the
virgin
the
supreme
symbol
of
terrestrial
humanity
the
angelical
ideal
therefore
is
not
the
christian
ideal
and
still
less
is
it
the
human
ideal
nor
can
it
be
an
angel
moreover
is
a
neutral
being
without
sex
and
without
country
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
feel
the
other
life
the
eternal
life
i
have
already
repeated
more
than
once
as
a
life
of
angelical
contemplation
it
must
be
a
life
of
action
goethe
said
that
man
must
believe
in
immortality
since
in
his
nature
he
has
a
right
to
it
and
he
added
the
conviction
of
our
persistence
arises
in
me
from
the
concept
of
activity
if
i
work
without
ceasing
to
the
end
nature
is
obliged
ist
die
natur
to
provide
me
with
another
form
of
existence
since
my
actual
spirit
can
bear
no
more
change
nature
to
god
and
you
have
a
thought
that
remains
christian
in
character
for
the
first
fathers
of
the
church
did
not
believe
that
the
immortality
of
the
soul
was
a
natural
gift
that
is
to
say
something
rational
but
a
divine
gift
of
grace
and
that
which
is
of
grace
is
usually
in
its
essence
of
justice
since
justice
is
divine
and
gratuitous
not
natural
and
goethe
added
i
could
begin
nothing
with
an
eternal
happiness
before
me
unless
new
tasks
and
new
difficulties
were
given
me
to
overcome
and
true
it
is
that
there
is
no
happiness
in
a
vacuity
of
contemplation
but
may
there
not
be
some
justification
for
the
morality
of
the
hermit
of
the
carthusian
the
ethic
of
the
thebaid
might
we
not
say
perhaps
that
it
is
necessary
to
preserve
these
exceptional
types
in
order
that
they
may
stand
as
everlasting
patterns
for
mankind
do
not
men
breed
racehorses
which
are
useless
for
any
practical
kind
of
work
but
which
preserve
the
purity
of
the
breed
and
become
the
sires
of
excellent
hackneys
and
hunters
is
there
not
a
luxury
of
ethics
not
less
justifiable
than
any
other
sort
of
luxury
but
on
the
other
hand
is
not
all
this
substantially
esthetics
and
not
ethics
still
less
religion
may
not
the
contemplative
medieval
monastic
ideal
be
esthetical
and
not
religious
nor
even
ethical
and
after
all
those
of
the
seekers
after
solitude
who
have
related
to
us
their
conversation
when
they
were
alone
with
god
have
performed
an
eternalizing
work
they
have
concerned
themselves
with
the
souls
of
others
and
by
this
alone
that
it
has
given
us
an
eckhart
a
seuse
a
tauler
a
ruysbroek
a
juan
de
la
cruz
a
catherine
of
siena
an
angela
of
foligno
a
teresa
de
jesús
is
the
cloister
justified
but
the
chief
of
our
spanish
orders
are
the
predicadores
founded
by
domingo
de
guzmán
for
the
aggressive
work
of
extirpating
heresy
the
company
of
jesus
a
militia
with
the
world
as
its
field
of
operations
which
explains
its
history
the
order
of
the
escuelas
pías
also
devoted
to
a
work
of
an
aggressive
or
invasive
nature
that
of
instruction
i
shall
certainly
be
reminded
that
the
reform
of
the
contemplative
order
of
the
carmelites
which
teresa
de
jesús
undertook
was
a
spanish
work
yes
spanish
it
was
and
in
it
men
sought
liberty
it
was
in
fact
the
yearning
for
liberty
for
inward
liberty
which
in
the
troubled
days
of
the
inquisition
led
many
choice
spirits
to
the
cloister
they
imprisoned
themselves
in
order
that
they
might
be
more
free
is
it
not
a
fine
thing
that
a
poor
nun
of
san
josé
can
attain
to
sovereignty
over
the
whole
earth
and
the
elements
said
teresa
in
her
it
was
the
pauline
yearning
for
liberty
the
longing
to
shake
off
the
bondage
of
the
external
law
which
was
then
very
severe
and
as
maestro
fray
luis
de
león
said
very
stubborn
but
did
they
actually
find
liberty
in
the
cloister
it
is
very
doubtful
if
they
did
and
it
is
impossible
for
true
liberty
is
not
to
rid
oneself
of
the
external
law
liberty
is
consciousness
of
the
law
not
he
who
has
shaken
off
the
yoke
of
the
law
is
free
but
he
who
has
made
himself
master
of
the
law
liberty
must
be
sought
in
the
midst
of
the
world
which
is
the
domain
of
the
law
and
of
sin
the
offspring
of
the
law
that
which
we
must
be
freed
from
is
sin
which
is
collective
instead
of
renouncing
the
world
in
order
that
we
may
dominate
it
and
who
does
not
know
the
collective
instinct
of
domination
of
those
religious
orders
whose
members
renounce
the
world
what
we
ought
to
do
is
to
dominate
the
world
in
order
that
we
may
be
able
to
renounce
it
not
to
seek
poverty
and
submission
but
to
seek
wealth
in
order
that
we
may
use
it
to
increase
human
consciousness
and
to
seek
power
for
the
same
end
it
is
curious
that
monks
and
anarchists
should
be
at
enmity
with
each
other
when
fundamentally
they
both
profess
the
same
ethic
and
are
related
by
close
ties
of
kinship
anarchism
tends
to
become
a
kind
of
atheistic
monachism
and
a
religious
rather
than
an
ethical
or
doctrine
the
one
party
starts
from
the
assumption
that
man
is
naturally
evil
born
in
original
sin
and
that
it
is
through
grace
that
he
becomes
good
if
indeed
he
ever
does
become
good
and
the
other
from
the
assumption
that
man
is
naturally
good
and
is
subsequently
perverted
by
society
and
these
two
theories
really
amount
to
the
same
thing
for
in
both
the
individual
is
opposed
to
society
as
if
the
individual
had
preceded
society
and
therefore
were
destined
to
survive
it
and
both
ethics
are
ethics
of
the
cloister
and
the
fact
that
guilt
is
collective
must
not
actuate
me
to
throw
mine
upon
the
shoulders
of
others
but
rather
to
take
upon
myself
the
burden
of
the
guilt
of
others
the
guilt
of
all
men
not
to
merge
and
sink
my
guilt
in
the
total
mass
of
guilt
but
to
make
this
total
guilt
my
own
not
to
dismiss
and
banish
my
own
guilt
but
to
open
the
doors
of
my
heart
to
the
guilt
of
all
men
to
centre
it
within
myself
and
appropriate
it
to
myself
and
each
one
of
us
ought
to
help
to
remedy
the
guilt
and
just
because
others
do
not
do
so
the
fact
that
society
is
guilty
aggravates
the
guilt
of
each
member
of
it
someone
ought
to
do
it
but
why
should
i
is
the
ever
phrase
of
amiability
someone
ought
to
do
it
so
why
not
i
is
the
cry
of
some
earnest
servant
of
man
eagerly
forward
springing
to
face
some
perilous
duty
between
these
two
sentences
lie
whole
centuries
of
moral
evolution
thus
spoke
annie
besant
in
her
autobiography
thus
spoke
theosophy
the
fact
that
society
is
guilty
aggravates
the
guilt
of
each
one
and
he
is
most
guilty
who
most
is
sensible
of
the
guilt
christ
the
innocent
since
he
best
knew
the
intensity
of
the
guilt
was
in
a
certain
sense
the
most
guilty
in
him
the
culpability
together
with
the
divinity
of
humanity
arrived
at
the
consciousness
of
itself
many
are
wont
to
be
amused
when
they
read
how
because
of
the
most
trifling
faults
faults
at
which
a
man
of
the
world
would
merely
smile
the
greatest
saints
counted
themselves
the
greatest
sinners
but
the
intensity
of
the
fault
is
not
measured
by
the
external
act
but
by
the
consciousness
of
it
and
an
act
for
which
the
conscience
of
one
man
suffers
acutely
makes
scarcely
any
impression
on
the
conscience
of
another
and
in
a
saint
conscience
may
be
developed
so
fully
and
to
such
a
degree
of
sensitiveness
that
the
slightest
sin
may
cause
him
more
remorse
than
his
crime
causes
the
greatest
criminal
and
sin
rests
upon
our
consciousness
of
it
it
is
in
him
who
judges
and
in
so
far
as
he
judges
when
a
man
commits
a
vicious
act
believing
in
good
faith
that
he
is
doing
a
virtuous
action
we
can
not
hold
him
morally
guilty
while
on
the
other
hand
that
man
is
guilty
who
commits
an
act
which
he
believes
to
be
wrong
even
though
in
itself
the
act
is
indifferent
or
perhaps
beneficent
the
act
passes
away
the
intention
remains
and
the
evil
of
the
evil
act
is
that
it
corrupts
the
intention
that
in
knowingly
doing
wrong
a
man
is
predisposed
to
go
on
doing
it
that
it
blurs
the
conscience
and
doing
evil
is
not
the
same
as
being
evil
evil
blurs
the
conscience
and
not
only
the
moral
conscience
but
the
general
psychical
consciousness
and
everything
that
exalts
and
expands
consciousness
is
good
while
that
which
depresses
and
diminishes
it
is
evil
and
here
we
might
raise
the
question
which
according
to
plato
was
propounded
by
socrates
as
to
whether
virtue
is
knowledge
which
is
equivalent
to
asking
whether
virtue
is
rational
the
ethicists
those
who
maintain
that
ethics
is
a
science
those
whom
the
reading
of
these
divagations
will
provoke
to
exclaim
rhetoric
rhetoric
rhetoric
would
appear
to
think
that
virtue
is
the
fruit
of
knowledge
of
rational
study
and
that
even
mathematics
help
us
to
be
better
men
i
do
not
know
but
for
my
part
i
feel
that
virtue
like
religion
like
the
longing
never
to
die
and
all
these
are
fundamentally
the
same
thing
is
the
fruit
of
passion
but
i
shall
be
asked
what
then
is
passion
i
do
not
know
or
rather
i
know
full
well
because
i
feel
it
and
since
i
feel
it
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
define
it
to
myself
nay
more
i
fear
that
if
i
were
to
arrive
at
a
definition
of
it
i
should
cease
to
feel
it
and
to
possess
it
passion
is
like
suffering
and
like
suffering
it
creates
its
object
it
is
easier
for
the
fire
to
find
something
to
burn
than
for
something
combustible
to
find
the
fire
that
this
may
appear
empty
and
sophistical
well
i
know
and
i
shall
also
be
told
that
there
is
the
science
of
passion
and
the
passion
of
science
and
that
it
is
in
the
moral
sphere
that
reason
and
life
unite
together
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
know
and
perhaps
i
may
be
saying
fundamentally
the
same
thing
although
more
confusedly
that
my
imaginary
adversaries
say
only
more
clearly
more
definitely
and
more
rationally
those
adversaries
whom
i
imagine
in
order
that
i
may
have
someone
to
fight
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
know
but
what
they
say
freezes
me
and
sounds
to
me
as
though
it
proceeded
from
emptiness
of
feeling
and
returning
to
our
former
question
is
virtue
knowledge
is
knowledge
virtue
for
they
are
two
distinct
questions
virtue
may
be
a
science
the
science
of
acting
rightly
without
every
other
science
being
therefore
virtue
the
virtue
of
machiavelli
is
a
science
and
it
can
not
be
said
that
his
is
always
moral
virtue
it
is
well
known
moreover
that
the
cleverest
and
the
most
learned
men
are
not
the
best
no
no
no
physiology
does
not
teach
us
how
to
digest
nor
logic
how
to
discourse
nor
esthetics
how
to
feel
beauty
or
express
it
nor
ethics
how
to
be
good
and
indeed
it
is
well
if
they
do
not
teach
us
how
to
be
hypocrites
for
pedantry
whether
it
be
the
pedantry
of
logic
or
of
esthetics
or
of
ethics
is
at
bottom
nothing
but
hypocrisy
reason
perhaps
teaches
certain
bourgeois
virtues
but
it
does
not
make
either
heroes
or
saints
perhaps
the
saint
is
he
who
does
good
not
for
good
sake
but
for
god
sake
for
the
sake
of
eternalization
perhaps
on
the
other
hand
culture
or
as
i
should
say
culture
oh
this
culture
which
is
primarily
the
work
of
philosophers
and
men
of
science
is
a
thing
which
neither
heroes
nor
saints
have
had
any
share
in
the
making
of
for
saints
have
concerned
themselves
very
little
with
the
progress
of
human
culture
they
have
concerned
themselves
rather
with
the
salvation
of
the
individual
souls
of
those
amongst
whom
they
lived
of
what
account
in
the
history
of
human
culture
is
our
san
juan
de
la
cruz
for
example
that
fiery
little
monk
as
culture
in
perhaps
somewhat
uncultured
phrase
has
called
him
compared
with
descartes
all
those
saints
burning
with
religious
charity
towards
their
neighbours
hungering
for
their
own
and
others
eternalization
who
went
about
burning
hearts
inquisitors
it
may
be
what
have
all
those
saints
done
for
the
progress
of
the
science
of
ethics
did
any
of
them
discover
the
categorical
imperative
like
the
old
bachelor
of
königsberg
who
if
he
was
not
a
saint
deserved
to
be
one
the
son
of
a
famous
professor
of
ethics
one
who
scarcely
ever
opened
his
lips
without
mentioning
the
categorical
imperative
was
lamenting
to
me
one
day
the
fact
that
he
lived
in
a
desolating
dryness
of
spirit
in
a
state
of
inward
emptiness
and
i
was
constrained
to
answer
him
thus
my
friend
your
father
had
a
subterranean
river
flowing
through
his
spirit
a
fresh
current
fed
by
the
beliefs
of
his
early
childhood
by
hopes
in
the
beyond
and
while
he
thought
that
he
was
nourishing
his
soul
with
this
categorical
imperative
or
something
of
that
sort
he
was
in
reality
nourishing
it
with
those
waters
which
had
their
spring
in
his
childish
days
and
it
may
be
that
to
you
he
has
given
the
flower
of
his
spirit
his
rational
doctrines
of
ethics
but
not
the
root
not
the
subterranean
source
not
the
irrational
substratum
how
was
it
that
krausism
took
root
here
in
spain
while
kantism
and
hegelianism
did
not
although
the
two
latter
systems
are
much
more
profound
morally
and
philosophically
than
the
first
because
in
transplanting
the
first
its
roots
were
transplanted
with
it
the
philosophical
thought
of
a
people
or
a
period
is
as
it
were
the
flower
the
thing
that
is
external
and
above
ground
but
this
flower
or
fruit
if
you
prefer
it
draws
its
sap
from
the
root
of
the
plant
and
this
root
which
is
in
and
under
the
ground
is
the
religious
sense
the
philosophical
thought
of
kant
the
supreme
flower
of
the
mental
evolution
of
the
germanic
people
has
its
roots
in
the
religious
feeling
of
luther
and
it
is
not
possible
for
kantism
especially
the
practical
part
of
it
to
take
root
and
bring
forth
flower
and
fruit
in
peoples
who
have
not
undergone
the
experience
of
the
reformation
and
who
perhaps
were
incapable
of
experiencing
it
kantism
is
protestant
and
we
spaniards
are
fundamentally
catholic
and
if
krause
struck
some
roots
here
more
numerous
and
more
permanent
than
is
commonly
supposed
it
is
because
krause
had
roots
in
pietism
and
pietism
as
ritschl
has
demonstrated
in
his
des
has
specifically
catholic
roots
and
may
be
described
as
the
irruption
or
rather
the
persistence
of
catholic
mysticism
in
the
heart
of
protestant
rationalism
and
this
explains
why
not
a
few
catholic
thinkers
in
spain
became
followers
of
krause
and
since
we
spaniards
are
catholic
whether
we
know
it
or
not
and
whether
we
like
it
or
not
and
although
some
of
us
may
claim
to
be
rationalists
or
atheists
perhaps
the
greatest
service
we
can
render
to
the
cause
of
culture
and
of
what
is
of
more
value
than
culture
religiousness
if
indeed
they
are
not
the
same
thing
is
in
endeavouring
to
formulate
clearly
to
ourselves
this
subconscious
social
or
popular
catholicism
of
ours
and
that
is
what
i
have
attempted
to
do
in
this
work
what
i
call
the
tragic
sense
of
life
in
men
and
peoples
is
at
any
rate
our
tragic
sense
of
life
that
of
spaniards
and
the
spanish
people
as
it
is
reflected
in
my
consciousness
which
is
a
spanish
consciousness
made
in
spain
and
this
tragic
sense
of
life
is
essentially
the
catholic
sense
of
it
for
catholicism
and
above
all
popular
catholicism
is
tragic
the
people
abhors
comedy
when
pilate
the
type
of
the
refined
gentleman
the
superior
person
the
esthete
the
rationalist
if
you
like
proposes
to
give
the
people
comedy
and
mockingly
presents
christ
to
them
saying
behold
the
man
the
people
mutinies
and
shouts
crucify
him
crucify
him
the
people
does
not
want
comedy
but
tragedy
and
that
which
dante
the
great
catholic
called
the
divine
comedy
is
the
most
tragical
tragedy
that
has
ever
been
written
and
as
i
have
endeavoured
in
these
essays
to
exhibit
the
soul
of
a
spaniard
and
therewithal
the
spanish
soul
i
have
curtailed
the
number
of
quotations
from
spanish
writers
while
scattering
with
perhaps
too
lavish
a
hand
those
from
the
writers
of
other
countries
for
all
human
souls
are
and
there
is
one
figure
a
comically
tragic
figure
a
figure
in
which
is
revealed
all
that
is
profoundly
tragic
in
the
human
comedy
the
figure
of
our
lord
don
quixote
the
spanish
christ
who
resumes
and
includes
in
himself
the
immortal
soul
of
my
people
perhaps
the
passion
and
death
of
the
knight
of
the
sorrowful
countenance
is
the
passion
and
death
of
the
spanish
people
its
death
and
resurrection
and
there
is
a
quixotesque
philosophy
and
even
a
quixotesque
metaphysic
there
is
a
quixotesque
logic
and
also
a
quixotesque
ethic
and
a
quixotesque
religious
sense
the
religious
sense
of
spanish
catholicism
this
is
the
philosophy
this
is
the
logic
this
is
the
ethic
this
is
the
religious
sense
that
i
have
endeavoured
to
outline
to
suggest
rather
than
to
develop
in
this
work
to
develop
it
rationally
no
the
quixotesque
madness
does
not
submit
to
scientific
logic
and
now
before
concluding
and
bidding
my
readers
farewell
it
remains
for
me
to
speak
of
the
rôle
that
is
reserved
for
don
quixote
in
the
modern
european
let
us
see
in
the
next
and
last
essay

isa

is
that
i
bring
to
a
conclusion
for
the
present
at
any
rate
these
essays
that
threaten
to
become
like
a
tale
that
has
no
ending
they
have
gone
straight
from
my
hands
to
the
press
in
the
form
of
a
kind
of
improvization
upon
notes
collected
during
a
number
of
years
and
in
writing
each
essay
i
have
not
had
before
me
any
of
those
that
preceded
it
and
thus
they
will
go
forth
full
of
inward
contradictions
apparent
contradictions
at
any
rate
like
life
and
like
me
myself
my
sin
if
any
has
been
that
i
have
embellished
them
to
excess
with
foreign
quotations
many
of
which
will
appear
to
have
been
dragged
in
with
a
certain
degree
of
violence
but
i
will
explain
this
another
time
a
few
years
after
our
lord
don
quixote
had
journeyed
through
spain
jacob
böhme
declared
in
his
chap
that
he
did
not
write
a
story
or
history
related
to
him
by
others
but
that
he
himself
had
had
to
stand
in
the
battle
which
he
found
to
be
full
of
heavy
strivings
and
wherein
he
was
often
struck
down
to
the
ground
like
all
other
men
and
a
little
further
on
he
adds
although
i
must
become
a
spectacle
of
scorn
to
the
world
and
the
devil
yet
my
hope
is
in
god
concerning
the
life
to
come
in
him
will
i
venture
to
hazard
it
and
not
resist
or
strive
against
the
spirit
amen
and
like
this
quixote
of
the
german
intellectual
world
neither
will
i
resist
the
spirit
and
therefore
i
cry
with
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
and
i
send
forth
my
cry
from
this
university
of
salamanca
a
university
that
arrogantly
styled
itself
scientiarum
and
which
carlyle
called
a
stronghold
of
ignorance
and
which
a
french
man
of
letters
recently
called
a
phantom
university
i
send
it
forth
from
this
spain
the
land
of
dreams
that
become
realities
the
rampart
of
europe
the
home
of
the
knightly
ideal
to
quote
from
a
letter
which
the
american
poet
archer
huntington
sent
me
the
other
day
from
this
spain
which
was
the
head
and
front
of
the
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
well
they
repay
her
for
it
in
the
fourth
of
these
essays
i
spoke
of
the
essence
of
catholicism
and
the
chief
factors
in
it
that
is
in
europe
have
been
the
renaissance
the
reformation
and
the
revolution
which
for
the
ideal
of
an
eternal
life
have
substituted
the
ideal
of
progress
of
reason
of
science
or
rather
of
science
with
the
capital
letter
and
last
of
all
the
dominant
ideal
of
comes
culture
and
in
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
an
age
essentially
unphilosophical
and
technical
dominated
by
a
myopic
specialism
and
by
historical
materialism
this
ideal
took
a
practical
form
not
so
much
in
the
popularization
as
in
the
vulgarization
of
science
or
rather
of
venting
itself
in
a
flood
of
cheap
popular
and
propagandist
literature
science
sought
to
popularize
itself
as
if
it
were
its
function
to
come
down
to
the
people
and
subserve
their
passions
and
not
the
duty
of
the
people
to
rise
to
science
and
through
science
to
rise
to
higher
heights
to
new
and
profounder
aspirations
all
this
led
brunetière
to
proclaim
the
bankruptcy
of
science
and
this
science
if
you
like
to
call
it
science
did
in
effect
become
bankrupt
and
as
it
failed
to
satisfy
men
continued
their
quest
for
happiness
but
without
finding
it
either
in
wealth
or
in
knowledge
or
in
power
or
in
pleasure
or
in
resignation
or
in
a
good
conscience
or
in
culture
and
the
result
was
pessimism
neither
did
the
gospel
of
progress
satisfy
what
end
did
progress
serve
man
would
not
accommodate
himself
to
rationalism
the
did
not
suffice
him
he
sought
to
give
a
final
finality
to
life
and
what
i
call
the
final
finality
is
the
real
and
the
famous
du
which
announced
itself
in
rousseau
and
was
exhibited
more
plainly
in
sénancour
than
in
any
other
character
neither
was
nor
is
anything
else
but
the
loss
of
faith
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
in
the
human
finality
of
the
universe
the
truest
symbol
of
it
is
to
be
found
in
a
creation
of
fiction
faustus
this
immortal
faustus
the
product
of
the
renaissance
and
the
reformation
first
comes
into
our
ken
at
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
when
in
he
is
introduced
to
us
by
christopher
marlowe
this
is
the
same
character
that
goethe
was
to
rediscover
two
centuries
later
although
in
certain
respects
the
earlier
faust
was
the
fresher
and
more
spontaneous
and
side
by
side
with
him
mephistopheles
appears
of
whom
faust
asks
what
good
will
my
soul
do
thy
lord
enlarge
his
kingdom
mephistopheles
replies
is
that
the
reason
why
he
tempts
us
thus
the
doctor
asks
again
and
the
evil
spirit
answers
miseris
socios
habuisse
which
mistranslated
into
romance
is
the
equivalent
of
our
proverb
the
misfortune
of
many
is
the
consolation
of
fools
where
we
are
is
hell
and
where
hell
is
there
must
we
ever
be
mephistopheles
continues
to
which
faust
answers
that
he
thinks
hell
a
fable
and
asks
him
who
made
the
world
and
finally
this
tragic
doctor
tortured
with
our
torture
meets
helen
who
although
no
doubt
marlowe
never
suspected
it
is
none
other
than
renascent
culture
and
in
marlowe
there
is
a
scene
that
is
worth
the
whole
of
the
second
part
of
the
of
goethe
faust
says
to
helen
sweet
helen
make
me
immortal
with
a
kiss
and
he
kisses
her
her
lips
suck
forth
my
soul
see
where
it
flies
come
helen
come
give
me
my
soul
again
here
will
i
dwell
for
helen
is
in
these
lips
and
all
is
dross
that
is
not
helena
give
me
my
soul
again
the
cry
of
faust
the
doctor
when
after
having
kissed
helen
he
is
about
to
be
lost
eternally
for
the
primitive
faust
has
no
ingenuous
margaret
to
save
him
this
idea
of
his
salvation
was
the
invention
of
goethe
and
is
there
not
a
faust
whom
we
all
know
our
own
faust
this
faust
has
studied
philosophy
jurisprudence
medicine
and
even
theology
only
to
find
that
we
can
know
nothing
and
he
has
sought
escape
in
the
open
country
ins
weite
and
has
encountered
mephistopheles
the
embodiment
of
that
force
which
ever
willing
evil
ever
achieves
good
in
its
own
despite
this
faust
has
been
led
by
mephistopheles
to
the
arms
of
margaret
child
of
the
people
she
whom
faust
the
overwise
had
lost
and
thanks
to
her
for
she
gave
herself
to
him
this
faust
is
saved
redeemed
by
the
people
that
believes
with
a
simple
faith
but
there
was
a
second
part
for
that
faust
was
the
anecdotical
faust
and
not
the
categorical
faust
of
goethe
and
he
gave
himself
again
to
culture
to
helen
and
begot
euphorion
upon
her
and
everything
ends
among
mystical
choruses
with
the
discovery
of
the
eternal
feminine
poor
euphorion
and
this
helen
is
the
spouse
of
the
fair
menelaus
the
helen
whom
paris
bore
away
who
was
the
cause
of
the
war
of
troy
and
of
whom
the
ancient
trojans
said
that
no
one
should
be
incensed
because
men
fought
for
a
woman
who
bore
so
terrible
a
likeness
to
the
immortal
gods
but
i
rather
think
that
faust
helen
was
that
other
helen
who
accompanied
simon
magus
and
whom
he
declared
to
be
the
divine
wisdom
and
faust
can
say
to
her
give
me
my
soul
again
for
helen
with
her
kisses
takes
away
our
soul
and
what
we
long
for
and
have
need
of
is
soul
soul
of
bulk
and
substance
but
the
renaissance
the
reformation
and
the
revolution
came
bringing
helen
to
us
or
rather
urged
on
by
helen
and
now
they
talk
to
us
about
culture
and
europe
europe
this
idea
of
europe
primarily
and
immediately
of
geographical
significance
has
been
converted
for
us
by
some
magical
process
into
a
kind
of
metaphysical
category
who
can
say
in
spain
at
any
rate
what
europe
is
i
only
know
that
it
is
a
shibboleth
my
and
when
i
proceed
to
examine
what
it
is
that
our
europeanizers
call
europe
it
sometimes
seems
to
me
that
much
of
its
periphery
remains
outside
of
it
spain
of
course
and
also
england
italy
scandinavia
russia
and
hence
it
is
reduced
to
the
central
portion
with
its
annexes
and
dependencies
all
this
is
the
consequence
i
repeat
of
the
renaissance
and
the
reformation
which
although
apparently
they
lived
in
a
state
of
internecine
war
were
the
italians
of
the
renaissance
were
all
of
them
socinians
the
humanists
with
erasmus
at
their
head
regarded
luther
the
german
monk
as
a
barbarian
who
derived
his
driving
force
from
the
cloister
as
did
bruno
and
campanella
but
this
barbarian
was
their
and
though
their
antagonist
he
was
also
the
antagonist
of
the
common
enemy
all
this
i
say
is
due
to
the
renaissance
and
the
reformation
and
to
what
was
the
offspring
of
these
two
the
revolution
and
to
them
we
owe
also
a
new
inquisition
that
of
science
or
culture
which
turns
against
those
who
refuse
to
submit
to
its
orthodoxy
the
weapons
of
ridicule
and
contempt
when
galileo
sent
his
treatise
on
the
earth
motion
to
the
grand
duke
of
tuscany
he
told
him
that
it
was
meet
that
that
which
the
higher
authorities
had
determined
should
be
believed
and
obeyed
and
that
he
considered
his
treatise
as
poetry
or
as
a
dream
and
as
such
i
desire
your
highness
to
receive
it
and
at
other
times
he
calls
it
a
chimera
or
a
mathematical
caprice
and
in
the
same
way
in
these
essays
for
fear
also
why
not
confess
it
of
the
inquisition
of
the
modern
the
scientific
inquisition
i
offer
as
a
poetry
dream
chimera
mystical
caprice
that
which
springs
from
what
is
deepest
in
me
and
i
say
with
galileo
si
muove
but
is
it
only
because
of
this
fear
ah
no
for
there
is
another
more
tragic
inquisition
and
that
is
the
inquisition
which
the
modern
man
the
man
of
culture
the
european
and
such
am
i
whether
i
will
or
not
carries
within
him
there
is
a
more
terrible
ridicule
and
that
is
the
ridicule
with
which
a
man
contemplates
his
own
self
it
is
my
reason
that
laughs
at
my
faith
and
despises
it
and
it
is
here
that
i
must
betake
me
to
my
lord
don
quixote
in
order
that
i
may
learn
of
him
how
to
confront
ridicule
and
overcome
it
and
a
ridicule
which
perhaps
who
knows
he
never
knew
yes
yes
how
shall
my
reason
not
smile
at
these
dilettantesque
mystical
interpretations
in
which
there
is
anything
rather
than
patient
study
and
shall
i
say
scientific
objectivity
and
method
and
nevertheless
si
muove
si
muove
and
i
take
refuge
in
dilettantism
in
what
a
pedant
would
call
philosophy
as
a
shelter
against
the
pedantry
of
specialists
against
the
philosophy
of
the
professional
philosophers
and
who
knows
progress
usually
comes
from
the
barbarian
and
there
is
nothing
more
stagnant
than
the
philosophy
of
the
philosophers
and
the
theology
of
the
theologians
let
them
talk
to
us
of
europe
the
civilization
of
thibet
is
parallel
with
ours
and
men
who
disappear
like
ourselves
have
lived
and
are
living
by
it
and
over
all
civilizations
there
hovers
the
shadow
of
ecclesiastes
with
his
admonition
how
dieth
the
wise
man
as
the
fool
ii
among
the
people
of
my
country
there
is
an
admirable
reply
to
the
customary
interrogation
how
are
you
and
it
is
living
and
that
is
the
truth
we
are
living
and
living
as
much
as
all
the
rest
what
can
a
man
ask
for
more
and
who
does
not
recollect
the
verse
vez
que
considero
que
me
tengo
de
morir
tiendo
la
capa
en
el
suelo
y
no
me
harto
de
but
no
not
sleeping
but
dreaming
dreaming
life
since
life
is
a
dream
among
us
spaniards
another
phrase
has
very
rapidly
passed
into
current
usage
the
expression
it
a
question
of
passing
the
time
or
killing
the
time
and
in
fact
we
make
time
in
order
to
kill
it
but
there
is
something
that
has
always
preoccupied
us
as
much
as
or
more
than
passing
the
time
a
formula
which
denotes
an
esthetical
attitude
and
that
is
gaining
eternity
which
is
the
formula
of
the
religious
attitude
the
truth
is
we
leap
from
the
esthetic
and
the
economic
to
the
religious
passing
over
the
logical
and
the
ethical
we
jump
from
art
to
religion
one
of
our
younger
novelists
ramón
pérez
de
ayala
in
his
recent
novel
pata
de
la
has
told
us
that
the
idea
of
death
is
the
trap
and
spirit
the
fox
or
the
wary
virtue
with
which
to
circumvent
the
ambushes
set
by
fatality
and
he
continues
caught
in
the
trap
weak
men
and
weak
peoples
lie
prone
on
the
ground
to
robust
spirits
and
strong
peoples
the
rude
shock
of
danger
gives
they
quickly
penetrate
into
the
heart
of
the
immeasurable
beauty
of
life
and
renouncing
for
ever
their
original
hastiness
and
folly
emerge
from
the
trap
with
muscles
taut
for
action
and
with
the
soul
vigour
power
and
efficiency
increased
a
hundredfold
but
let
us
see
weak
men
weak
peoples
robust
spirits
strong
peoples
what
does
all
this
mean
i
do
not
know
what
i
think
i
know
is
that
some
individuals
and
peoples
have
not
yet
really
thought
about
death
and
immortality
have
not
felt
them
and
that
others
have
ceased
to
think
about
them
or
rather
ceased
to
feel
them
and
the
fact
that
they
have
never
passed
through
the
religious
period
is
not
i
think
a
matter
for
either
men
or
peoples
to
boast
about
the
immeasurable
beauty
of
life
is
a
very
fine
thing
to
write
about
and
there
are
indeed
some
who
resign
themselves
to
it
and
accept
it
as
it
is
and
even
some
who
would
persuade
us
that
there
is
no
problem
in
the
trap
but
it
has
been
said
by
calderón
that
to
seek
to
persuade
a
man
that
the
misfortunes
which
he
suffers
are
not
misfortunes
does
not
console
him
for
them
but
is
another
misfortune
in
addition
and
furthermore
only
the
heart
can
speak
to
the
heart
as
fray
diego
de
estella
said
del
cap
a
short
time
ago
a
reply
that
i
made
to
those
who
reproached
us
spaniards
for
our
scientific
incapacity
appeared
to
scandalize
some
people
after
having
remarked
that
the
electric
light
and
the
steam
engine
function
here
in
spain
just
as
well
as
in
the
countries
where
they
were
invented
and
that
we
make
use
of
logarithms
as
much
as
they
do
in
the
country
where
the
idea
of
them
was
first
conceived
i
exclaimed
let
others
invent
a
paradoxical
expression
which
i
do
not
retract
we
spaniards
ought
to
appropriate
to
ourselves
some
of
those
sage
counsels
which
count
joseph
de
maistre
gave
to
the
russians
a
people
not
unlike
ourselves
in
his
admirable
letters
to
count
rasoumowski
on
public
education
in
russia
he
said
that
a
nation
should
not
think
the
worse
of
itself
because
it
was
not
made
for
science
that
the
romans
had
no
understanding
of
the
arts
neither
did
they
possess
a
mathematician
which
however
did
not
prevent
them
from
playing
their
part
in
the
world
and
in
particular
we
should
take
to
heart
everything
that
he
said
about
that
crowd
of
arrogant
sciolists
who
idolize
the
tastes
the
fashions
and
the
languages
of
foreign
countries
and
are
ever
ready
to
pull
down
whatever
they
despise
and
they
despise
everything
we
have
not
the
scientific
spirit
and
what
of
that
if
we
have
some
other
spirit
and
who
can
tell
if
the
spirit
that
we
have
is
or
is
not
compatible
with
the
scientific
spirit
but
in
saying
let
others
invent
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
we
must
be
content
with
playing
a
passive
rôle
no
for
them
their
science
by
which
we
shall
profit
for
us
our
own
work
it
is
not
enough
to
be
on
the
defensive
we
must
attack
but
we
must
attack
wisely
and
cautiously
reason
must
be
our
weapon
it
is
the
weapon
even
of
the
fool
our
sublime
fool
and
our
exemplar
don
quixote
after
he
had
destroyed
with
two
strokes
of
his
sword
that
pasteboard
visor
which
he
had
fitted
to
his
made
it
anew
placing
certain
iron
bars
within
it
in
such
a
manner
that
he
rested
satisfied
with
its
solidity
and
without
wishing
to
make
a
second
trial
of
it
he
deputed
and
held
it
in
estimation
of
a
most
excellent
visor
and
with
the
pasteboard
visor
on
his
head
he
made
himself
immortal
that
is
to
say
he
made
himself
ridiculous
for
it
was
by
making
himself
ridiculous
that
don
quixote
achieved
his
immortality
and
there
are
so
many
ways
of
making
ourselves
ridiculous
i
cournot
said
traité
de
des
idées
it
is
best
not
to
speak
to
either
princes
or
peoples
of
the
probabilities
of
death
princes
will
punish
this
temerity
with
disgrace
the
public
will
revenge
itself
with
ridicule
true
and
therefore
it
is
said
that
we
must
live
as
the
age
lives
et
corrumpi
sæculum
tacitus
it
is
necessary
to
know
how
to
make
ourselves
ridiculous
and
not
only
to
others
but
to
ourselves
and
more
than
ever
when
there
is
so
much
chatter
about
our
backwardness
compared
with
other
civilized
peoples
when
a
parcel
of
critics
say
that
we
have
had
no
science
no
art
no
philosophy
no
renaissance
of
this
we
had
perhaps
too
much
no
anything
these
same
critics
being
ignorant
of
our
real
history
a
history
that
remains
yet
to
be
written
the
first
task
being
to
undo
the
web
of
calumniation
and
protest
that
has
been
woven
around
it
carducci
the
author
of
the
phrase
about
the
grandiositá

written
in
that
even
spain
which
never
attained
the
hegemony
of
the
world
of
thought
had
her
cervantes
but
was
cervantes
a
solitary
and
isolated
phenomenon
without
roots
without
ancestry
without
a
foundation
that
an
italian
rationalist
remembering
that
it
was
spain
that
reacted
against
the
renaissance
in
his
country
should
say
that
spain
ebbe
egemonia
mai
di
is
however
readily
comprehended
was
there
no
importance
was
there
nothing
akin
to
cultural
hegemony
in
the
of
which
spain
was
the
champion
and
which
in
point
of
fact
began
with
the
sack
of
rome
by
the
spaniards
a
providential
chastisement
of
the
city
of
the
pagan
popes
of
the
pagan
renaissance
apart
from
the
question
as
to
whether
the
was
good
or
bad
was
there
nothing
akin
to
hegemony
in
loyola
or
the
council
of
trent
previous
to
this
council
italy
witnessed
a
nefarious
and
unnatural
union
between
christianity
and
paganism
or
rather
between
immortalism
and
mortalism
a
union
to
which
even
some
of
the
popes
themselves
consented
in
their
souls
theological
error
was
philosophical
truth
and
all
difficulties
were
solved
by
the
accommodating
formula
but
it
was
otherwise
after
the
council
after
the
council
came
the
open
and
avowed
struggle
between
reason
and
faith
science
and
religion
and
does
not
the
fact
that
this
change
was
brought
about
thanks
principally
to
spanish
obstinacy
point
to
something
akin
to
hegemony
without
the
would
the
reformation
have
followed
the
course
that
it
did
actually
follow
without
the
might
not
the
reformation
deprived
of
the
support
of
pietism
have
perished
in
the
gross
rationalism
of
the
of
the
age
of
enlightenment
would
nothing
have
been
changed
had
there
been
no
charles
no
philip
our
great

a
negative
achievement
it
will
be
said
but
what
is
that
what
is
negative
what
is
positive
at
what
point
in

a
line
always
continuing
in
the
same
direction
from
the
past
to
the
future
does
the
zero
occur
which
denotes
the
boundary
between
the
positive
and
the
negative
spain
which
is
said
to
be
the
land
of
knights
and
rogues
and
all
of
them
rogues
has
been
the
country
most
slandered
by
history
precisely
because
it
championed
the
and
because
its
arrogance
has
prevented
it
from
stepping
down
into
the
public
forum
into
the
world
vanity
fair
and
publishing
its
own
justification
let
us
leave
on
one
side
spain
eight
centuries
of
warfare
against
the
moors
during
which
she
defended
europe
from
mohammedanism
her
work
of
internal
unification
her
discovery
of
america
and
the
indies
for
this
was
the
achievement
of
spain
and
portugal
and
not
of
columbus
and
vasco
da
gama
let
us
leave
all
this
and
more
than
this
on
one
side
and
it
is
not
a
little
thing
is
it
not
a
cultural
achievement
to
have
created
a
score
of
nations
reserving
nothing
for
herself
and
to
have
begotten
as
the
conquistadores
did
free
men
on
poor
indian
slaves
apart
from
all
this
does
our
mysticism
count
for
nothing
in
the
world
of
thought
perhaps
the
peoples
whose
souls
helen
will
ravish
away
with
her
kisses
may
some
day
have
to
return
to
this
mysticism
to
find
their
souls
again
but
as
everybody
knows
culture
is
composed
of
ideas
and
only
of
ideas
and
man
is
only
culture
instrument
man
for
the
idea
and
not
the
idea
for
man
the
substance
for
the
shadow
the
end
of
man
is
to
create
science
to
catalogue
the
universe
so
that
it
may
be
handed
back
to
god
in
order
as
i
wrote
years
ago
in
my
novel
y
man
apparently
is
not
even
an
idea
and
at
the
end
of
all
the
human
race
will
fall
exhausted
at
the
foot
of
a
pile
of
libraries
whole
woods
rased
to
the
ground
to
provide
the
paper
that
is
stored
away
in
them
museums
machines
factories
laboratories
in
order
to
bequeath
them
to
whom
for
god
will
surely
not
accept
them
that
horrible
regenerationist
literature
almost
all
of
it
an
imposture
which
the
loss
of
our
last
american
colonies
provoked
led
us
into
the
pedantry
of
extolling
persevering
and
silent
effort
and
this
with
great
vociferation
vociferating
silence
of
extolling
prudence
exactitude
moderation
spiritual
fortitude
synteresis
equanimity
the
social
virtues
and
the
chiefest
advocates
of
them
were
those
of
us
who
lacked
them
most
almost
all
of
us
spaniards
fell
into
this
ridiculous
mode
of
literature
some
more
and
some
less
and
so
it
befell
that
that
joaquín
costa
one
of
the
least
european
spirits
we
ever
had
invented
his
famous
saying
that
we
must
europeanize
spain
and
while
proclaiming
that
we
must
lock
up
the
sepulchre
of
the
cid
with
a
sevenfold
lock
urged
us
to
conquer
africa
and
i
myself
uttered
the
cry
down
with
don
quixote
and
from
this
blasphemy
which
meant
the
very
opposite
of
what
it
said
such
was
the
fashion
of
the
hour
sprang
my
de
don
quijote
y
and
my
cult
of
quixotism
as
the
national
religion
i
wrote
that
book
in
order
to
rethink
in
opposition
to
the
cervantists
and
erudite
persons
in
order
to
make
a
living
work
of
what
was
and
still
is
for
the
majority
a
dead
letter
what
does
it
matter
to
me
what
cervantes
intended
or
did
not
intend
to
put
into
it
and
what
he
actually
did
put
into
it
what
is
living
in
it
is
what
i
myself
discover
in
it
whether
cervantes
put
it
there
or
not
what
i
myself
put
into
and
under
and
over
it
and
what
we
all
put
into
it
i
wanted
to
hunt
down
our
philosophy
in
it
for
the
conviction
continually
grows
upon
me
that
our
philosophy
the
spanish
philosophy
is
liquescent
and
diffused
in
our
literature
in
our
life
in
our
action
in
our
mysticism
above
all
and
not
in
philosophical
systems
it
is
concrete
and
is
there
not
perhaps
as
much
philosophy
or
more
in
goethe
for
example
as
in
hegel
the
poetry
of
jorge
manrique
the
romancero
vida
es
the
al
monte
imply
an
intuition
of
the
world
and
a
concept
of
life
und
and
it
was
difficult
for
this
philosophy
of
ours
to
formulate
itself
in
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
period
that
was
aphilosophical
positivist
technicist
devoted
to
pure
history
and
the
natural
sciences
a
period
essentially
materialist
and
pessimist
our
language
itself
like
every
cultured
language
contains
within
itself
an
implicit
philosophy
a
language
in
effect
is
a
potential
philosophy
platonism
is
the
greek
language
which
discourses
in
plato
unfolding
its
secular
metaphors
scholasticism
is
the
philosophy
of
the
dead
latin
of
the
middle
ages
wrestling
with
the
popular
tongues
the
french
language
discourses
in
descartes
the
german
in
kant
and
in
hegel
and
the
english
in
hume
and
in
stuart
mill
for
the
truth
is
that
the
logical
of
all
philosophical
speculation
is
not
the
i
neither
is
it
representation
nor
the
world
as
it
presents
itself
immediately
to
the
senses
but
it
is
mediate
or
historical
representation
humanly
elaborated
and
such
as
it
is
given
to
us
principally
in
the
language
by
means
of
which
we
know
the
world
it
is
not
psychical
but
spiritual
representation
when
we
think
we
are
obliged
to
set
out
whether
we
know
it
not
and
whether
we
will
or
not
from
what
has
been
thought
by
others
who
came
before
us
and
who
environ
us
thought
is
an
inheritance
kant
thought
in
german
and
into
german
he
translated
hume
and
rousseau
who
thought
in
english
and
french
respectively
and
did
not
spinoza
think
in
obstructed
by
and
contending
with
dutch
thought
rests
upon
prejudgements
and
prejudgements
pass
into
language
to
language
bacon
rightly
ascribed
not
a
few
of
the
errors
of
the
but
is
it
possible
to
philosophize
in
pure
algebra
or
even
in
esperanto
in
order
to
see
the
result
of
such
an
attempt
one
has
only
to
read
the
work
of
avenarius
on
the
criticism
of
pure
experience
of
this
prehuman
or
inhuman
experience
and
even
avenarius
who
was
obliged
to
invent
a
language
invented
one
that
was
based
upon
the
latin
tradition
with
roots
which
carry
in
their
metaphorical
implications
a
content
of
impure
experience
of
human
social
experience
all
philosophy
is
therefore
at
bottom
philology
and
philology
with
its
great
and
fruitful
law
of
analogical
formations
opens
wide
the
door
to
chance
to
the
irrational
to
the
absolutely
incommensurable
history
is
not
mathematics
neither
is
philosophy
and
how
many
philosophical
ideas
are
not
strictly
owing
to
something
akin
to
rhyme
to
the
necessity
of
rightly
placing
a
consonant
in
kant
himself
there
is
a
great
deal
of
this
of
esthetic
symmetry
rhyme
representation
is
therefore
like
language
like
reason
itself
which
is
simply
internal
language
a
social
and
racial
product
and
race
the
blood
of
the
spirit
is
language
as
oliver
wendell
holmes
has
said
and
as
i
have
often
repeated
it
was
in
athens
and
with
socrates
that
our
western
philosophy
first
became
mature
conscious
of
itself
and
it
arrived
at
this
consciousness
by
means
of
the
dialogue
of
social
conversation
and
it
is
profoundly
significant
that
the
doctrine
of
innate
ideas
of
the
objective
and
normative
value
of
ideas
of
what
scholasticism
afterwards
knew
as
realism
should
have
formulated
itself
in
dialogues
and
these
ideas
which
constitute
reality
are
names
as
nominalism
showed
not
that
they
may
not
be
more
than
names
but
that
they
are
nothing
less
than
names
language
is
that
which
gives
us
reality
and
not
as
a
mere
vehicle
of
reality
but
as
its
true
flesh
of
which
all
the
rest
dumb
or
inarticulate
representation
is
merely
the
skeleton
and
thus
logic
operates
upon
esthetics
the
concept
upon
the
expression
upon
the
word
and
not
upon
the
brute
perception
and
this
is
true
even
in
the
matter
of
love
love
does
not
discover
that
it
is
love
until
it
speaks
until
it
says
i
love
thee
in
novel
chartreuse
de
it
is
with
a
very
profound
intuition
that
count
mosca
furious
with
jealousy
because
of
the
love
which
he
believes
unites
the
duchess
of
sanseverina
with
his
nephew
fabrice
is
made
to
say
i
must
be
calm
if
my
manner
is
violent
the
duchess
simply
because
her
vanity
is
piqued
is
capable
of
following
belgirate
and
then
during
the
journey
chance
may
lead
to
a
word
which
will
give
a
name
to
the
feelings
they
bear
towards
each
other
and
thereupon
in
a
moment
all
the
consequences
will
follow
even
so
all
things
were
made
by
the
word
and
the
word
was
in
the
beginning
thought
reason
that
is
living
language
is
an
inheritance
and
the
solitary
thinker
of
aben
tofail
the
arab
philosopher
of
guadix
is
as
absurd
as
the
ego
of
descartes
the
real
and
concrete
truth
not
the
methodical
and
ideal
is
sum
ergo
to
feel
oneself
a
man
is
more
immediate
than
to
think
but
on
the
other
hand
history
the
process
of
culture
finds
its
perfection
and
complete
effectivity
only
in
the
individual
the
end
of
history
and
humanity
is
man
each
man
each
individual
sum
ergo
cogito
cogito
ut
sim
michael
de
the
individual
is
the
end
of
the
universe
and
we
spaniards
feel
this
very
strongly
that
the
individual
is
the
end
of
the
universe
the
introspective
individuality
of
the
spaniard
was
pointed
out
by
martin
hume
in
a
passage
in
spanish
upon
which
i
commented
in
an
essay
published
in
españa
and
it
is
perhaps
this
same
introspective
individualism
which
has
not
permitted
the
growth
on
spanish
soil
of
strictly
philosophical
or
rather
metaphysical
systems
and
this
in
spite
of
suárez
whose
formal
subtilties
do
not
merit
the
name
of
philosophy
our
metaphysics
if
we
can
be
said
to
possess
such
a
thing
has
been
metanthropics
and
our
metaphysicians
have
been
philologists
or
rather
humanists
in
the
most
comprehensive
sense
of
the
term
menéndez
de
pelayo
as
benedetto
croce
very
truly
said
bibliographical
appendix
was
inclined
towards
metaphysical
idealism
but
he
appeared
to
wish
to
take
something
from
other
systems
even
from
empirical
theories
for
this
reason
croce
considers
that
his
work
referring
to
his
de
las
ideas
estéticas
de
suffers
from
a
certain
uncertainty
from
the
theoretical
point
of
view
of
its
author
menéndez
de
pelayo
which
was
that
of
a
perfervid
spanish
humanist
who
not
wishing
to
disown
the
renaissance
invented
what
he
called
vivism
the
philosophy
of
luis
vives
and
perhaps
for
no
other
reason
than
because
he
himself
like
vives
was
an
eclectic
spaniard
of
the
renaissance
and
it
is
true
that
menéndez
de
pelayo
whose
philosophy
is
certainly
all
uncertainty
educated
in
barcelona
in
the
timidities
of
the
scottish
philosophy
as
it
had
been
imported
into
the
catalan
spirit
that
creeping
philosophy
of
common
sense
which
was
anxious
not
to
compromise
itself
and
yet
was
all
compromise
and
which
is
so
well
exemplified
in
balmes
always
shunned
all
strenuous
inward
combat
and
formed
his
consciousness
upon
compromises
angel
ganivet
a
man
all
divination
and
instinct
was
more
happily
inspired
in
my
opinion
when
he
proclaimed
that
the
spanish
philosophy
was
that
of
seneca
the
pagan
stoic
of
cordoba
whom
not
a
few
christians
regarded
as
one
of
themselves
a
philosophy
lacking
in
originality
of
thought
but
speaking
with
great
dignity
of
tone
and
accent
his
accent
was
a
spanish
accent
not
hellenic
and
there
are
echoes
of
him
in
tertullian
spanish
too
at
heart
who
believed
in
the
corporal
and
substantial
nature
of
god
and
the
soul
and
who
was
a
kind
of
don
quixote
in
the
world
of
christian
thought
in
the
second
century
but
perhaps
we
must
look
for
the
hero
of
spanish
thought
not
in
any
actual
philosopher
but
in
a
creation
of
fiction
a
man
of
action
who
is
more
real
than
all
the
philosophers
don
quixote
there
is
undoubtedly
a
philosophical
quixotism
but
there
is
also
a
quixotic
philosophy
may
it
not
perhaps
be
that
the
philosophy
of
the
conquistadores
of
the
of
loyola
and
above
all
in
the
order
of
abstract
but
deeply
felt
thought
that
of
our
mystics
was
in
its
essence
none
other
than
this
what
was
the
mysticism
of
john
of
the
cross
but
a
of
the
heart
in
the
divine
warfare
and
the
philosophy
of
don
quixote
can
not
strictly
be
called
idealism
he
did
not
fight
for
ideas
it
was
of
the
spiritual
order
he
fought
for
the
spirit
imagine
don
quixote
turning
his
heart
to
religious
speculation
as
he
himself
once
dreamed
of
doing
when
he
met
those
images
in
which
certain
peasants
were
carrying
to
set
up
in
the
retablo
of
their
village
church
imagine
don
quixote
given
up
to
meditation
upon
eternal
truths
and
see
him
ascending
mount
carmel
in
the
middle
of
the
dark
night
of
the
soul
to
watch
from
its
summit
the
rising
of
that
sun
which
never
sets
and
like
the
eagle
that
was
john
companion
in
the
isle
of
patmos
to
gaze
upon
it
face
to
face
and
scrutinize
its
spots
he
leaves
to
athena
owl
the
goddess
with
the
glaucous
or
eyes
who
sees
in
the
dark
but
who
is
dazzled
by
the
light
of
noon
he
leaves
to
the
owl
that
accompanied
athena
in
olympus
the
task
of
searching
with
keen
eyes
in
the
shadows
for
the
prey
wherewith
to
feed
its
young
and
the
speculative
or
meditative
quixotism
is
like
the
practical
quixotism
madness
a
to
the
madness
of
the
cross
and
therefore
it
is
despised
by
the
reason
at
bottom
philosophy
abhors
christianity
and
well
did
the
gentle
marcus
aurelius
prove
it
the
tragedy
of
christ
the
divine
tragedy
is
the
tragedy
of
the
cross
pilate
the
sceptic
the
man
of
culture
by
making
a
mockery
of
it
sought
to
convert
it
into
a
comedy
he
conceived
the
farcical
idea
of
the
king
with
the
reed
sceptre
and
crown
of
thorns
and
cried
behold
the
man
but
the
people
more
human
than
he
the
people
that
thirsts
for
tragedy
shouted
crucify
him
crucify
him
and
the
human
the
tragedy
is
the
tragedy
of
don
quixote
whose
face
was
daubed
with
soap
in
order
that
he
might
make
sport
for
the
servants
of
the
dukes
and
for
the
dukes
themselves
as
servile
as
their
servants
behold
the
madman
they
would
have
said
and
the
comic
the
irrational
tragedy
is
the
tragedy
of
suffering
caused
by
ridicule
and
contempt
the
greatest
height
of
heroism
to
which
an
individual
like
a
people
can
attain
is
to
know
how
to
face
ridicule
better
still
to
know
how
to
make
oneself
ridiculous
and
not
to
shrink
from
the
ridicule
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
forceful
sonnets
of
that
tragic
portuguese
antero
de
quental
who
died
by
his
own
hand
feeling
acutely
for
the
plight
of
his
country
on
the
occasion
of
the
british
ultimatum
in
he
wrote
as
follows
an
english
statesman
of
the
last
century
who
was
also
undoubtedly
a
perspicacious
observer
and
a
philosopher
horace
walpole
said
that
for
those
who
feel
life
is
a
tragedy
and
a
comedy
for
those
who
think
very
well
then
if
we
are
destined
to
end
tragically
we
portuguese
we
who
we
would
far
rather
prefer
this
terrible
but
noble
destiny
to
that
which
is
reserved
and
perhaps
at
no
very
remote
future
date
for
england
the
country
that
and
whose
destiny
it
is
to
finish
miserably
and
comically
we
may
leave
on
one
side
the
assertion
that
the
english
are
a
thinking
and
calculating
people
implying
thereby
their
lack
of
feeling
the
injustice
of
which
is
explained
by
the
occasion
which
provoked
it
and
also
the
assertion
that
the
portuguese
feel
implying
that
they
do
not
think
or
calculate
for
we
of
the
atlantic
seaboard
have
always
been
distinguished
by
a
certain
pedantry
of
feeling
but
there
remains
a
basis
of
truth
underlying
this
terrible
idea
namely
that
some
peoples
those
who
put
thought
above
feeling
i
should
say
reason
above
faith
die
comically
while
those
die
tragically
who
put
faith
above
reason
for
the
mockers
are
those
who
die
comically
and
god
laughs
at
their
comic
ending
while
the
nobler
part
the
part
of
tragedy
is
theirs
who
endured
the
mockery
the
mockery
that
underlies
the
career
of
don
quixote
is
what
we
must
endeavour
to
discover
and
shall
we
be
told
yet
again
that
there
has
never
been
any
spanish
philosophy
in
the
technical
sense
of
the
word
i
will
answer
by
asking
what
is
this
sense
what
does
philosophy
mean
windelband
the
historian
of
philosophy
in
his
essay
on
the
meaning
of
philosophy
ist
in
the
first
volume
of
his
tells
us
that
the
history
of
the
word
is
the
history
of
the
cultural
significance
of
science
he
continues
when
scientific
thought
attains
an
independent
existence
as
a
desire
for
knowledge
for
the
sake
of
knowledge
it
takes
the
name
of
philosophy
when
subsequently
knowledge
as
a
whole
divides
into
its
various
branches
philosophy
is
the
general
knowledge
of
the
world
that
embraces
all
other
knowledge
as
soon
as
scientific
thought
stoops
again
to
becoming
a
means
to
ethics
or
religious
contemplation
philosophy
is
transformed
into
an
art
of
life
or
into
a
formulation
of
religious
beliefs
and
when
afterwards
the
scientific
life
regains
its
liberty
philosophy
acquires
once
again
its
character
as
an
independent
knowledge
of
the
world
and
in
so
far
as
it
abandons
the
attempt
to
solve
this
problem
it
is
changed
into
a
theory
of
knowledge
itself
here
you
have
a
brief
recapitulation
of
the
history
of
philosophy
from
thales
to
kant
including
the
medieval
scholasticism
upon
which
it
endeavoured
to
establish
religious
beliefs
but
has
philosophy
no
other
office
to
perform
and
may
not
its
office
be
to
reflect
upon
the
tragic
sense
of
life
itself
such
as
we
have
been
studying
it
to
formulate
this
conflict
between
reason
and
faith
between
science
and
religion
and
deliberately
to
perpetuate
this
conflict
later
on
windelband
says
by
philosophy
in
the
systematic
not
in
the
historical
sense
i
understand
the
critical
knowledge
of
values
of
universal
validity
but
what
values
are
there
of
more
universal
validity
than
that
of
the
human
will
seeking
before
all
else
the
personal
individual
and
concrete
immortality
of
the
soul
or
in
other
words
the
human
finality
of
the
universe
and
that
of
the
human
reason
denying
the
rationality
and
even
the
possibility
of
this
desire
what
values
are
there
of
more
universal
validity
than
the
rational
or
mathematical
value
and
the
volitional
or
teleological
value
of
the
universe
in
conflict
with
one
another
for
windelband
as
for
kantians
and
in
general
there
are
only
three
normative
categories
three
universal
norms
those
of
the
true
or
the
false
the
beautiful
or
the
ugly
and
the
morally
good
or
evil
philosophy
is
reduced
to
logics
esthetics
and
ethics
accordingly
as
it
studies
science
art
or
morality
another
category
remains
excluded
namely
that
of
the
pleasing
and
the
unpleasing
or
the
agreeable
and
the
disagreeable
in
other
words
the
hedonic
the
hedonic
can
not
according
to
them
pretend
to
universal
validity
it
can
not
be
normative
whosoever
throws
upon
philosophy
wrote
windelband
the
burden
of
deciding
the
question
of
optimism
and
pessimism
whosoever
demands
that
philosophy
should
pronounce
judgement
on
the
question
as
to
whether
the
world
is
more
adapted
to
produce
pain
than
pleasure
or
such
a
one
if
his
attitude
is
not
merely
that
of
a
dilettante
sets
himself
the
fantastic
task
of
finding
an
absolute
determination
in
a
region
in
which
no
reasonable
man
has
ever
looked
for
one
it
remains
to
be
seen
nevertheless
whether
this
is
as
clear
as
it
seems
in
the
case
of
a
man
like
myself
who
am
at
the
same
time
reasonable
and
yet
nothing
but
a
dilettante
which
of
course
would
be
the
abomination
of
desolation
it
was
with
a
very
profound
insight
that
benedetto
croce
in
his
philosophy
of
the
spirit
in
relation
to
esthetics
as
the
science
of
expression
and
to
logic
as
the
science
of
pure
concept
divided
practical
philosophy
into
two
branches
economics
and
ethics
he
recognizes
in
effect
the
existence
of
a
practical
grade
of
spirit
purely
economical
directed
towards
the
singular
and
unconcerned
with
the
universal
its
types
of
perfection
of
economic
genius
are
iago
and
napoleon
and
this
grade
remains
outside
morality
and
every
man
passes
through
this
grade
because
before
all
else
he
must
wish
to
be
himself
as
an
individual
and
without
this
grade
morality
would
be
inexplicable
just
as
without
esthetics
logic
would
lack
meaning
and
the
discovery
of
the
normative
value
of
the
economic
grade
which
seeks
the
hedonic
was
not
unnaturally
the
work
of
an
italian
a
disciple
of
machiavelli
who
speculated
so
fearlessly
with
regard
to
practical
efficiency
which
is
not
exactly
the
same
as
moral
virtue
but
at
bottom
this
economic
grade
is
but
the
rudimentary
state
of
the
religious
grade
the
religious
is
the
transcendental
economic
or
hedonic
religion
is
a
transcendental
economy
and
hedonistic
that
which
man
seeks
in
religion
in
religious
faith
is
to
save
his
own
individuality
to
eternalize
it
which
he
achieves
neither
by
science
nor
by
art
nor
by
ethics
god
is
a
necessity
neither
for
science
nor
art
nor
ethics
what
necessitates
god
is
religion
and
with
an
insight
that
amounts
to
genius
our
jesuits
speak
of
the
grand
business
of
our
salvation
business
yes
business
something
belonging
to
the
economic
hedonistic
order
although
transcendental
we
do
not
need
god
in
order
that
he
may
teach
us
the
truth
of
things
or
the
beauty
of
them
or
in
order
that
he
may
safeguard
morality
by
means
of
a
system
of
penalties
and
punishments
but
in
order
that
he
may
save
us
in
order
that
he
may
not
let
us
die
utterly
and
because
this
unique
longing
is
the
longing
of
each
and
every
normal
man
those
who
are
abnormal
by
reason
of
their
barbarism
or
their
hyperculture
may
be
left
out
of
the
reckoning
it
is
universal
and
normative
religion
therefore
is
a
transcendental
economy
or
if
you
like
metaphysic
together
with
its
logical
esthetic
and
ethical
values
the
universe
has
for
man
an
economic
value
also
which
when
thus
made
universal
and
normative
is
the
religious
value
we
are
not
concerned
only
with
truth
beauty
and
goodness
we
are
concerned
also
and
above
all
with
the
salvation
of
the
individual
with
perpetuation
which
those
norms
do
not
secure
for
us
that
science
of
economy
which
is
called
political
teaches
us
the
most
adequate
the
most
economical
way
of
satisfying
our
needs
whether
these
needs
are
rational
or
irrational
beautiful
or
ugly
moral
or
immoral
a
business
economically
good
may
be
a
swindle
something
that
in
the
long
run
kills
the
soul
and
the
supreme
human
is
the
need
of
not
dying
the
need
of
enjoying
for
ever
the
plenitude
of
our
own
individual
limitation
and
if
the
catholic
eucharistic
doctrine
teaches
that
the
substance
of
the
body
of
jesus
christ
is
present
whole
and
entire
in
the
consecrated
host
and
in
each
part
of
it
this
means
that
god
is
wholly
and
entirely
in
the
whole
universe
and
also
in
each
one
of
the
individuals
that
compose
it
and
this
is
fundamentally
not
a
logical
nor
an
esthetic
nor
an
ethical
principle
but
a
transcendental
economic
or
religious
principle
and
with
this
norm
philosophy
is
able
to
judge
of
optimism
and
pessimism
the
human
soul
is
immortal
the
world
is
economically
or
hedonistically
good
if
not
it
is
and
the
meaning
which
pessimism
and
optimism
give
to
the
categories
of
good
and
evil
is
not
an
ethical
sense
but
an
economic
or
hedonistic
sense
good
is
that
which
satisfies
our
vital
longing
and
evil
is
that
which
does
not
satisfy
it
philosophy
therefore
is
also
the
science
of
the
tragedy
of
life
a
reflection
upon
the
tragic
sense
of
it
an
essay
in
this
philosophy
with
its
inevitable
internal
contradictions
and
antinomies
is
what
i
have
attempted
in
these
essays
and
the
reader
must
not
overlook
the
fact
that
i
have
been
operating
upon
myself
that
this
work
partakes
of
the
nature
of
a
piece
of
and
without
any
other
anesthetic
than
that
of
the
work
itself
the
enjoyment
of
operating
upon
myself
has
ennobled
the
pain
of
being
operated
upon
and
as
for
my
other
claim
the
claim
that
this
is
a
spanish
philosophy
perhaps
spanish
philosophy
that
if
it
was
an
italian
who
discovered
the
normative
and
universal
value
of
the
economic
grade
it
is
a
spaniard
who
announces
that
this
grade
is
merely
the
beginning
of
the
religious
grade
and
that
the
essence
of
our
religion
of
our
spanish
catholicism
consists
precisely
in
its
being
neither
a
science
nor
an
art
nor
an
ethic
but
an
economy
of
things
eternal
that
is
to
say
of
things
divine
as
for
this
claim
that
all
this
is
spanish
i
must
leave
the
task
of
substantiating
it
to
another
and
an
historical
work
but
leaving
aside
the
external
and
written
tradition
that
which
can
be
demonstrated
by
reference
to
historical
documents
is
there
not
some
present
justification
of
this
claim
in
the
fact
that
i
am
a
spaniard
and
a
spaniard
who
has
scarcely
ever
been
outside
spain
a
product
therefore
of
the
spanish
tradition
of
the
living
tradition
of
the
tradition
which
is
transmitted
in
feelings
and
ideas
that
dream
and
not
in
texts
that
sleep
the
philosophy
in
the
soul
of
my
people
appears
to
me
as
the
expression
of
an
inward
tragedy
analogous
to
the
tragedy
of
the
soul
of
don
quixote
as
the
expression
of
a
conflict
between
what
the
world
is
as
scientific
reason
shows
it
to
be
and
what
we
wish
that
it
might
be
as
our
religious
faith
affirms
it
to
be
and
in
this
philosophy
is
to
be
found
the
explanation
of
what
is
usually
said
about
us
namely
that
we
are
fundamentally
irreducible
to
or
in
other
words
that
we
refuse
to
submit
to
it
no
don
quixote
does
not
resign
himself
either
to
the
world
or
to
science
or
logic
or
to
art
or
esthetics
or
to
morality
or
ethics
and
the
upshot
of
all
this
so
i
have
been
told
more
than
once
and
by
more
than
one
person
will
be
simply
that
all
you
will
succeed
in
doing
will
be
to
drive
people
to
the
wildest
catholicism
and
i
have
been
accused
of
being
a
reactionary
and
even
a
jesuit
be
it
so
and
what
then
yes
i
know
i
know
very
well
that
it
is
madness
to
seek
to
turn
the
waters
of
the
river
back
to
their
source
and
that
it
is
only
the
ignorant
who
seek
to
find
in
the
past
a
remedy
for
their
present
ills
but
i
know
too
that
everyone
who
fights
for
any
ideal
whatever
although
his
ideal
may
seem
to
lie
in
the
past
is
driving
the
world
on
to
the
future
and
that
the
only
reactionaries
are
those
who
find
themselves
at
home
in
the
present
every
supposed
restoration
of
the
past
is
a
creation
of
the
future
and
if
the
past
which
it
is
sought
to
restore
is
a
dream
something
imperfectly
known
so
much
the
better
the
march
as
ever
is
towards
the
future
and
he
who
marches
is
getting
there
even
though
he
march
walking
backwards
and
who
knows
if
that
is
not
the
better
way
i
feel
that
i
have
within
me
a
medieval
soul
and
i
believe
that
the
soul
of
my
country
is
medieval
that
it
has
perforce
passed
through
the
renaissance
the
reformation
and
the
revolution
learning
from
them
yes
but
without
allowing
them
to
touch
the
soul
preserving
the
spiritual
inheritance
which
has
come
down
from
what
are
called
the
dark
ages
and
quixotism
is
simply
the
most
desperate
phase
of
the
struggle
between
the
middle
ages
and
the
renaissance
which
was
the
offspring
of
the
middle
ages
and
if
some
accuse
me
of
subserving
the
cause
of
catholic
reaction
others
perhaps
the
official
catholics
but
these
in
spain
trouble
themselves
little
about
anything
and
are
interested
only
in
their
own
quarrels
and
dissensions
and
besides
poor
folk
they
have
neither
eyes
nor
ears
but
the
truth
is
that
my
work
i
was
going
to
say
my
mission
is
to
shatter
the
faith
of
men
here
there
and
everywhere
faith
in
affirmation
faith
in
negation
and
faith
in
abstention
from
faith
and
this
for
the
sake
of
faith
in
faith
itself
it
is
to
war
against
all
those
who
submit
whether
it
be
to
catholicism
or
to
rationalism
or
to
agnosticism
it
is
to
make
all
men
live
the
life
of
inquietude
and
passionate
desire
will
this
work
be
efficacious
but
did
don
quixote
believe
in
the
immediate
apparential
efficacy
of
his
work
it
is
very
doubtful
and
at
any
rate
he
did
not
by
any
chance
put
his
visor
to
the
test
by
slashing
it
a
second
time
and
many
passages
in
his
history
show
that
he
did
not
look
with
much
confidence
to
the
immediate
success
of
his
design
to
restore
and
what
did
it
matter
to
him
so
long
as
thus
he
lived
and
immortalized
himself
and
he
must
have
surmised
and
did
in
fact
surmise
that
his
work
would
have
another
and
higher
efficacy
and
that
was
that
it
would
ferment
in
the
minds
of
all
those
who
in
a
pious
spirit
read
of
his
exploits
don
quixote
made
himself
ridiculous
but
did
he
know
the
most
tragic
ridicule
of
all
the
inward
ridicule
the
ridiculousness
of
a
man
self
to
himself
in
the
eyes
of
his
own
soul
imagine
don
battlefield
to
be
his
own
soul
imagine
him
to
be
fighting
in
his
soul
to
save
the
middle
ages
from
the
renaissance
to
preserve
the
treasure
of
his
infancy
imagine
him
an
inward
don
quixote
with
a
sancho
at
his
side
inward
and
heroical
too
and
tell
me
if
you
find
anything
comic
in
the
tragedy
and
what
has
don
quixote
left
do
you
ask
i
answer
he
has
left
himself
and
a
man
a
living
and
eternal
man
is
worth
all
theories
and
all
philosophies
other
peoples
have
left
chiefly
institutions
books
we
have
left
souls
teresa
is
worth
any
institution
any
of
pure
but
don
quixote
was
converted
yes
and
died
poor
soul
but
the
other
the
real
don
quixote
he
who
remained
on
earth
and
lives
amongst
us
animating
us
with
his
spirit
this
don
quixote
was
not
converted
this
don
quixote
continues
to
incite
us
to
make
ourselves
ridiculous
this
don
quixote
must
never
die
and
the
conversion
of
the
other
don
quixote
he
who
was
converted
only
to
die
was
possible
because
he
was
mad
and
it
was
his
madness
and
not
his
death
nor
his
conversion
that
immortalized
him
earning
him
forgiveness
for
the
crime
of
having
been
born
culpa
and
neither
was
his
madness
cured
but
only
transformed
his
death
was
his
last
knightly
adventure
in
dying
he
stormed
heaven
which
suffereth
violence
this
mortal
don
quixote
died
and
descended
into
hell
which
he
entered
lance
on
rest
and
freed
all
the
condemned
as
he
had
freed
the
galley
slaves
and
he
shut
the
gates
of
hell
and
tore
down
the
scroll
that
dante
saw
there
and
replaced
it
by
one
on
which
was
written
long
live
hope
and
escorted
by
those
whom
he
had
freed
and
they
laughing
at
him
he
went
to
heaven
and
god
laughed
paternally
at
him
and
this
divine
laughter
filled
his
soul
with
eternal
happiness
and
the
other
don
quixote
remained
here
amongst
us
fighting
with
desperation
and
does
he
not
fight
out
of
despair
how
is
it
that
among
the
words
that
english
has
borrowed
from
our
language
such
as
camarilla
there
is
to
be
found
this
word
is
not
this
inward
don
quixote
that
i
spoke
of
conscious
of
his
own
tragic
comicness
a
man
of
despair
a
yes
like
pizarro
and
like
loyola
but
despair
is
the
master
of
impossibilities
as
we
learn
from
salazar
y
torres
al
act
i
and
it
is
despair
and
despair
alone
that
begets
heroic
hope
absurd
hope
mad
hope
quia
it
ought
to
have
been
said
rather
than
and
don
quixote
who
lived
in
solitude
sought
more
solitude
still
he
sought
the
solitudes
of
the
peña
pobre
in
order
that
there
alone
without
witnesses
he
might
give
himself
up
to
greater
follies
with
which
to
assuage
his
soul
but
he
was
not
quite
alone
for
sancho
accompanied
him
sancho
the
good
sancho
the
believing
sancho
the
simple
if
as
some
say
in
spain
don
quixote
is
dead
and
sancho
lives
then
we
are
saved
for
sancho
his
master
dead
will
become
a
himself
and
at
any
rate
he
is
waiting
for
some
other
mad
knight
to
follow
again
and
there
is
also
a
tragedy
of
sancho
the
other
sancho
the
sancho
who
journeyed
with
the
mortal
don
quixote
it
is
not
certain
that
he
died
although
some
think
that
he
died
hopelessly
mad
calling
for
his
lance
and
believing
in
the
truth
of
all
those
things
which
his
dying
and
converted
master
had
denounced
and
abominated
as
lies
but
neither
is
it
certain
that
the
bachelor
sansón
carrasco
or
the
curate
or
the
barber
or
the
dukes
and
canons
are
dead
and
it
is
with
these
that
the
heroical
sancho
has
to
contend
don
quixote
journeyed
alone
alone
with
sancho
alone
with
his
solitude
and
shall
we
not
also
journey
alone
we
his
lovers
creating
for
ourselves
a
quixotesque
spain
which
only
exists
in
our
imagination
and
again
we
shall
be
asked
what
has
don
quixote
bequeathed
to
i
answer
quixotism
and
that
is
no
little
thing
it
is
a
whole
method
a
whole
epistemology
a
whole
esthetic
a
whole
logic
a
whole
ethic
above
all
a
whole
religion
that
is
to
say
a
whole
economy
of
things
eternal
and
things
divine
a
whole
hope
in
what
is
rationally
absurd
for
what
did
don
quixote
fight
for
dulcinea
for
glory
for
life
for
survival
not
for
iseult
who
is
the
eternal
flesh
not
for
beatrice
who
is
theology
not
for
margaret
who
is
the
people
not
for
helen
who
is
culture
he
fought
for
dulcinea
and
he
won
her
for
he
lives
and
the
greatest
thing
about
him
was
his
having
been
mocked
and
vanquished
for
it
was
in
being
overcome
that
he
overcame
he
overcame
the
world
by
giving
the
world
cause
to
laugh
at
him
and
he
feels
his
own
comicness
and
the
vanity
of
his
endeavours
so
far
as
their
temporal
results
are
concerned
he
sees
himself
from
without
culture
has
taught
him
to
objectify
himself
to
alienate
himself
from
himself
instead
of
entering
into
himself
and
in
seeing
himself
from
without
he
laughs
at
himself
but
with
a
bitter
laughter
perhaps
the
most
tragic
character
would
be
that
of
a
margutte
of
the
inner
man
who
like
the
margutte
of
pulci
should
die
of
laughter
but
of
laughter
at
himself
riderá
in
he
will
laugh
for
all
eternity
said
the
angel
gabriel
of
margutte
do
you
not
hear
the
laughter
of
god
the
mortal
don
quixote
in
dying
realized
his
own
comicness
and
bewept
his
sins
but
the
immortal
quixote
realizing
his
own
comicness
superimposes
himself
upon
it
and
triumphs
over
it
without
renouncing
it
and
don
quixote
does
not
surrender
because
he
is
not
a
pessimist
and
he
fights
on
he
is
not
a
pessimist
because
pessimism
is
begotten
by
vanity
it
is
a
matter
of
fashion
pure
intellectual
snobbism
and
don
quixote
is
neither
vain
nor
modern
with
any
sort
of
modernity
still
less
is
he
a
modernist
and
he
does
not
understand
the
meaning
of
the
word
snob
unless
it
be
explained
to
him
in
old
christian
spanish
don
quixote
is
not
a
pessimist
for
since
he
does
not
understand
what
is
meant
by
the
de
he
does
not
understand
its
opposite
neither
does
he
understand
futurist
fooleries
in
spite
of
clavileño
he
has
not
got
as
far
as
the
aeroplane
which
seems
to
tend
to
put
not
a
few
fools
at
a
still
greater
distance
from
heaven
don
quixote
has
not
arrived
at
the
age
of
the
tedium
of
life
a
condition
that
not
infrequently
takes
the
form
of
that
topophobia
so
characteristic
of
many
modern
spirits
who
pass
their
lives
running
at
top
speed
from
one
place
to
another
not
from
any
love
of
the
place
to
which
they
are
going
but
from
hatred
of
the
place
they
are
leaving
behind
and
so
flying
from
all
places
which
is
one
of
the
forms
of
despair
but
don
quixote
hears
his
own
laughter
he
hears
the
divine
laughter
and
since
he
is
not
a
pessimist
since
he
believes
in
life
eternal
he
has
to
fight
attacking
the
modern
scientific
inquisitorial
orthodoxy
in
order
to
bring
in
a
new
and
impossible
middle
age
dualistic
contradictory
passionate
like
a
new
savonarola
an
italian
quixote
of
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
he
fights
against
this
modern
age
that
began
with
machiavelli
and
that
will
end
comically
he
fights
against
the
rationalism
inherited
from
the
eighteenth
century
peace
of
mind
reconciliation
between
reason
and
faith
this
thanks
to
the
providence
of
god
is
no
longer
possible
the
world
must
be
as
don
quixote
wishes
it
to
be
and
inns
must
be
castles
and
he
will
fight
with
it
and
will
to
all
appearances
be
vanquished
but
he
will
triumph
by
making
himself
ridiculous
and
he
will
triumph
by
laughing
at
himself
and
making
himself
the
object
of
his
own
laughter
reason
speaks
and
feeling
bites
said
petrarch
but
reason
also
bites
and
bites
in
the
inmost
heart
and
more
light
does
not
make
more
warmth
light
light
more
light
they
tell
us
that
the
dying
goethe
cried
no
warmth
warmth
more
warmth
for
we
die
of
cold
and
not
of
darkness
it
is
not
the
night
kills
but
the
frost
we
must
liberate
the
enchanted
princess
and
destroy
the
stage
of
master
peter
but
god
may
there
not
be
pedantry
too
in
thinking
ourselves
the
objects
of
mockery
and
in
making
don
quixotes
of
ourselves
kierkegaard
said
that
the
regenerate
desire
that
the
wicked
world
should
mock
at
them
for
the
better
assurance
of
their
own
regeneracy
for
the
enjoyment
of
being
able
to
bemoan
the
wickedness
of
the
world
uvidenskabelig
afsnit
cap
sect
b
the
question
is
how
to
avoid
the
one
or
the
other
pedantry
or
the
one
or
the
other
affectation
if
the
natural
man
is
only
a
myth
and
we
are
all
artificial
romanticism
yes
perhaps
that
is
partly
the
word
and
there
is
an
advantage
in
its
very
lack
of
precision
against
romanticism
the
forces
of
rationalist
and
classicist
pedantry
especially
in
france
have
latterly
been
unchained
romanticism
itself
is
merely
another
form
of
pedantry
the
pedantry
of
sentiment
perhaps
in
this
world
a
man
of
culture
is
either
a
dilettante
or
a
pedant
you
have
to
take
your
choice
yes
rené
and
adolphe
and
obermann
and
lara
perhaps
they
were
all
pedants
the
question
is
to
seek
consolation
in
disconsolation
the
philosophy
of
bergson
which
is
a
spiritualist
restoration
essentially
mystical
medieval
quixotesque
has
been
called
a
philosophy
leave
out
the
call
it
mundane
mundane
yes
a
philosophy
for
the
world
and
not
for
philosophers
just
as
chemistry
ought
to
be
not
for
chemists
alone
the
world
desires
illusion
vult
either
the
illusion
antecedent
to
reason
which
is
poetry
or
the
illusion
subsequent
to
reason
which
is
religion
and
machiavelli
has
said
that
whosoever
wishes
to
delude
will
always
find
someone
willing
to
be
deluded
blessed
are
they
who
are
easily
befooled
a
frenchman
jules
de
gaultier
said
that
it
was
the
privilege
of
his
countrymen
pas
not
to
be
taken
in
a
sorry
privilege
science
does
not
give
don
quixote
what
he
demands
of
it
then
let
him
not
make
the
demand
it
will
be
said
let
him
resign
himself
let
him
accept
life
and
truth
as
they
are
but
he
does
not
accept
them
as
they
are
and
he
asks
for
signs
urged
thereto
by
sancho
who
stands
by
his
side
and
it
is
not
that
don
quixote
does
not
understand
what
those
understand
who
talk
thus
to
him
those
who
succeed
in
resigning
themselves
and
accepting
rational
life
and
rational
truth
no
it
is
that
the
needs
of
his
heart
are
greater
pedantry
who
knows
and
in
this
critical
century
don
quixote
who
has
also
contaminated
himself
with
criticism
has
to
attack
his
own
self
the
victim
of
intellectualism
and
of
sentimentalism
and
when
he
wishes
to
be
most
spontaneous
he
appears
to
be
most
affected
and
he
wishes
unhappy
man
to
rationalize
the
irrational
and
irrationalize
the
rational
and
he
sinks
into
the
despair
of
the
critical
century
whose
two
greatest
victims
were
nietzsche
and
tolstoi
and
through
this
despair
he
reaches
the
heroic
fury
of
which
giordano
bruno
spoke
that
intellectual
don
quixote
who
escaped
from
the
cloister
and
becomes
an
awakener
of
sleeping
souls
animorum
as
the
said
of
himself
he
who
wrote
heroic
love
is
the
property
of
those
superior
natures
who
are
called
insane
not
because
they
do
not
know
but
because
they
but
bruno
believed
in
the
triumph
of
his
doctrines
at
any
rate
the
inscription
at
the
foot
of
his
statue
in
the
campo
dei
fiori
opposite
the
vatican
states
that
it
has
been
dedicated
to
him
by
the
age
which
he
had
foretold
secolo
da
lui
but
our
don
quixote
the
inward
the
immortal
don
quixote
conscious
of
his
own
comicness
does
not
believe
that
his
doctrines
will
triumph
in
this
world
because
they
are
not
of
it
and
it
is
better
that
they
should
not
triumph
and
if
the
world
wished
to
make
don
quixote
king
he
would
retire
alone
to
the
mountain
fleeing
from
the
and
crowds
as
christ
retired
alone
to
the
mountain
when
after
the
miracle
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
they
sought
to
proclaim
him
king
he
left
the
title
of
king
for
the
inscription
written
over
the
cross
what
then
is
the
new
mission
of
don
quixote
in
this
world
to
cry
aloud
to
cry
aloud
in
the
wilderness
but
though
men
hear
not
the
wilderness
hears
and
one
day
it
will
be
transformed
into
a
resounding
forest
and
this
solitary
voice
that
goes
scattering
over
the
wilderness
like
seed
will
fructify
into
a
gigantic
cedar
which
with
its
hundred
thousand
tongues
will
sing
an
eternal
hosanna
to
the
lord
of
life
and
of
death

now
to
you
the
younger
generation
bachelor

of

you
who
are
working
after
the
best

fashion

with
