i
if
you
take
the
turn
to
the
left
after
you
pass
the
at
combehurst
church
you
will
come
to
the
wooden
bridge
over
the
brook
keep
along
the
which
mounts
higher
and
higher
and
in
half
a
mile
or
so
you
will
be
in
a
breezy
upland
field
almost
large
enough
to
be
called
a
down
where
sheep
pasture
on
the
short
fine
elastic
turf
you
look
down
on
combehurst
and
its
beautiful
after
the
field
is
crossed
you
come
to
a
common
richly
colored
with
the
golden
gorse
and
the
purple
heather
which
in
send
out
their
warm
scents
into
the
quiet
air
the
swelling
waves
of
the
upland
make
a
near
horizon
against
the
sky
the
line
is
only
broken
in
one
place
by
a
small
grove
of
scotch
firs
which
always
look
black
and
shadowed
even
at
when
all
the
rest
of
the
landscape
seems
bathed
in
sunlight
the
lark
quivers
and
sings
high
up
in
the
air
too
high
in
too
dazzling
a
region
for
you
to
see
her
look
she
drops
into
sight
but
as
if
loth
to
leave
the
heavenly
radiance
she
balances
herself
and
floats
in
the
ether
now
she
falls
suddenly
right
into
her
nest
hidden
among
the
ling
unseen
except
by
the
eyes
of
heaven
and
the
small
bright
insects
that
run
hither
and
thither
on
the
elastic
with
something
like
the
sudden
drop
of
the
lark
the
path
goes
down
a
green
abrupt
descent
and
in
a
basin
surrounded
by
the
grassy
hills
there
stands
a
dwelling
which
is
neither
cottage
nor
house
but
something
between
the
two
in
size
nor
yet
is
it
a
farm
though
surrounded
by
living
things
it
is
or
rather
it
was
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
the
dwelling
of
browne
the
widow
of
the
late
curate
of
combehurst
there
she
lived
with
her
faithful
old
servant
and
her
only
children
a
boy
and
girl
they
were
as
secluded
in
their
green
hollow
as
the
households
in
the
german
once
a
week
they
emerged
and
crossed
the
common
catching
on
its
summit
the
first
sounds
of
the
bells
calling
them
to
church
browne
walked
first
holding
edward
hand
old
nancy
followed
with
maggie
but
they
were
all
one
party
and
all
talked
together
in
a
subdued
and
quiet
tone
as
beseemed
the
day
they
had
not
much
to
say
their
lives
were
too
unbroken
for
excepting
on
sundays
the
widow
and
her
children
never
went
to
combehurst
most
people
would
have
thought
the
little
town
a
quiet
dreamy
place
but
to
those
two
children
if
seemed
the
world
and
after
they
had
crossed
the
bridge
they
each
clasped
more
tightly
the
hands
which
they
held
and
looked
shyly
up
from
beneath
their
drooped
eyelids
when
spoken
to
by
any
of
their
mother
friends
browne
was
regularly
asked
by
some
one
to
stay
to
dinner
after
morning
church
and
as
regularly
declined
rather
to
the
timid
children
relief
although
in
the
they
sometimes
spoke
together
in
a
low
voice
of
the
pleasure
it
would
be
to
them
if
mamma
would
go
and
dine
at
buxton
where
the
little
girl
in
white
and
that
great
tall
boy
lived
instead
of
staying
there
or
anywhere
else
on
sundays
browne
thought
it
her
duty
to
go
and
cry
over
her
husband
grave
the
custom
had
arisen
out
of
true
sorrow
for
his
loss
for
a
kinder
husband
and
more
worthy
man
had
never
lived
but
the
simplicity
of
her
sorrow
had
been
destroyed
by
the
observation
of
others
on
the
mode
of
its
manifestation
they
made
way
for
her
to
cross
the
grass
toward
his
grave
and
she
fancying
that
it
was
expected
of
her
fell
into
the
habit
i
have
mentioned
her
children
holding
each
a
hand
felt
awed
and
uncomfortable
and
were
sensitively
conscious
how
often
they
were
pointed
out
as
a
mourning
group
to
observation
i
wish
it
would
always
rain
on
sundays
said
edward
one
day
to
maggie
in
a
garden
conference
why
asked
she
because
then
we
bustle
out
of
church
and
get
home
as
fast
as
we
can
to
save
mamma
crape
and
we
have
not
to
go
and
cry
over
papa
i
do
cry
said
maggie
do
you
edward
looked
round
before
he
answered
to
see
if
they
were
quite
alone
and
then
said
no
i
was
sorry
a
long
time
about
papa
but
one
ca
go
on
being
sorry
forever
perhaps
people
can
mamma
can
said
little
maggie
sometimes
i
am
very
sorry
too
when
i
am
by
myself
or
playing
with
you
or
when
i
am
wakened
up
by
the
moonlight
in
our
room
do
you
ever
waken
and
fancy
you
heard
papa
calling
you
i
do
sometimes
and
then
i
am
very
sorry
to
think
we
shall
never
hear
him
calling
us
again
ah
it
different
with
me
you
know
he
used
to
call
me
to
lessons
sometimes
he
called
me
when
he
was
displeased
with
me
but
i
always
dream
that
he
was
calling
us
in
his
own
kind
voice
as
he
used
to
do
when
he
wanted
us
to
walk
with
him
or
to
show
us
something
pretty
edward
was
silent
playing
with
something
on
the
ground
at
last
he
looked
round
again
and
having
convinced
himself
that
they
could
not
be
overheard
he
whispered
maggie
sometimes
i
do
think
i
sorry
that
papa
is
dead
when
naughty
you
know
he
would
have
been
so
angry
with
me
if
he
had
been
here
and
i
think
only
sometimes
you
know
i
rather
glad
he
is
not
oh
edward
you
do
mean
to
say
so
i
know
do
let
us
talk
about
him
we
ca
talk
rightly
we
such
little
children
do
edward
please
poor
little
maggie
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
never
spoke
again
to
edward
or
indeed
to
any
one
about
her
dead
father
as
she
grew
older
her
life
became
more
actively
busy
the
cottage
and
small
outbuildings
and
the
garden
and
field
were
their
own
and
on
the
produce
they
depended
for
much
of
their
support
the
cow
the
pig
and
the
poultry
took
up
much
of
time
browne
and
maggie
had
to
do
a
great
deal
of
the
and
when
the
beds
were
made
and
the
rooms
swept
and
dusted
and
the
preparations
for
dinner
ready
then
if
there
was
any
time
maggie
sat
down
to
her
lessons
ned
who
prided
himself
considerably
on
his
sex
had
been
sitting
all
the
morning
in
his
father
in
the
little
studying
as
he
chose
to
call
it
sometimes
maggie
would
pop
her
head
in
with
a
request
that
he
would
help
her
to
carry
the
great
pitcher
of
water
or
do
some
other
little
household
service
with
which
request
he
occasionally
complied
but
with
so
many
complaints
about
the
interruption
that
at
last
she
told
him
she
would
never
ask
him
again
gently
as
this
was
said
he
yet
felt
it
as
a
reproach
and
tried
to
excuse
himself
you
see
maggie
a
man
must
be
educated
to
be
a
gentleman
now
if
a
woman
knows
how
to
keep
a
house
that
all
that
is
wanted
from
her
so
my
time
is
of
more
consequence
than
yours
mamma
says
i
to
go
to
college
and
be
a
clergyman
so
i
must
get
on
with
my
latin
maggie
submitted
in
silence
and
almost
felt
it
as
an
act
of
gracious
condescension
when
a
morning
or
two
afterwards
he
came
to
meet
her
as
she
was
toiling
in
from
the
well
carrying
the
great
brown
jug
full
of
ready
for
dinner
here
said
he
let
us
put
it
in
the
shade
behind
the
oh
maggie
look
what
you
done
spilt
it
all
with
not
turning
quickly
enough
when
i
told
you
now
you
may
fetch
it
again
for
yourself
for
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
did
not
understand
you
in
time
said
she
softly
but
he
had
turned
away
and
gone
back
in
offended
dignity
to
the
house
maggie
had
nothing
to
do
but
return
to
the
well
and
fill
it
again
the
spring
was
some
distance
off
in
a
little
rocky
dell
it
was
so
cool
after
her
hot
walk
that
she
sat
down
in
the
shadow
of
the
gray
limestone
rock
and
looked
at
the
ferns
wet
with
the
dripping
water
she
felt
sad
she
knew
not
why
i
think
ned
is
sometimes
very
cross
thought
she
i
did
not
understand
he
was
carrying
it
there
perhaps
i
am
clumsy
mamma
says
i
am
and
ned
says
i
am
nancy
never
says
so
and
papa
never
said
so
i
wish
i
could
help
being
clumsy
and
stupid
ned
says
all
women
are
so
i
wish
i
was
not
a
woman
it
must
be
a
fine
thing
to
be
a
man
oh
dear
i
must
go
up
the
field
again
with
this
heavy
pitcher
and
my
arms
do
so
ache
she
rose
and
climbed
the
steep
brae
as
she
went
she
heard
her
mother
voice
maggie
maggie
there
no
water
for
dinner
and
the
potatoes
are
quite
boiled
where
that
child
they
had
begun
dinner
before
she
came
down
from
brushing
her
hair
and
washing
her
hands
she
was
hurried
and
tired
mother
said
ned
may
i
have
some
butter
to
these
potatoes
as
there
is
cold
meat
they
are
so
dry
certainly
my
dear
maggie
go
and
fetch
a
pat
of
butter
out
of
the
dairy
maggie
went
from
her
untouched
dinner
without
speaking
here
stop
you
child
said
nancy
turning
her
back
in
the
passage
you
go
to
your
dinner
i
fetch
the
butter
you
been
running
about
enough
maggie
durst
not
go
back
without
it
but
she
stood
in
the
passage
till
nancy
returned
and
then
she
put
up
her
mouth
to
be
kissed
by
the
kind
rough
old
servant
a
sweet
one
said
nancy
to
herself
as
she
turned
into
the
kitchen
and
maggie
went
back
to
her
dinner
with
a
soothed
and
lightened
heart
when
the
meal
was
ended
she
helped
her
mother
to
wash
up
the
glasses
and
spoons
which
were
treated
with
tender
care
and
exquisite
cleanliness
in
that
house
of
decent
frugality
and
then
exchanging
her
pinafore
for
a
black
silk
apron
the
little
maiden
was
wont
to
sit
down
to
some
useful
piece
of
needlework
in
doing
which
her
mother
enforced
the
most
dainty
neatness
of
stitches
thus
every
hour
in
its
circle
brought
a
duty
to
be
fulfilled
but
duties
fulfilled
are
as
pleasures
to
the
memory
and
little
maggie
always
thought
those
early
childish
days
most
happy
and
remembered
them
only
as
filled
with
careless
contentment
yet
at
the
time
they
had
their
cares
in
fine
summer
days
maggie
sat
out
of
doors
at
her
work
just
beyond
the
court
lay
the
rocky
moorland
almost
as
gay
as
that
with
its
profusion
of
flowers
if
the
court
had
its
clustering
noisettes
and
fraxinellas
and
sweetbriar
and
great
tall
white
lilies
the
moorland
had
its
little
creeping
scented
rose
its
straggling
honeysuckle
and
an
abundance
of
yellow
cistus
and
here
and
there
a
gray
rock
cropped
out
of
the
ground
and
over
it
the
yellow
and
grew
luxuriantly
such
a
rock
was
maggie
seat
i
believe
she
considered
it
her
own
and
loved
it
accordingly
although
its
real
owner
was
a
great
lord
who
lived
far
away
and
had
never
seen
the
moor
much
less
the
piece
of
gray
rock
in
his
life
the
afternoon
of
the
day
which
i
have
begun
to
tell
you
about
she
was
sitting
there
and
singing
to
herself
as
she
worked
she
was
within
call
of
home
and
could
hear
all
home
sounds
with
their
shrillness
softened
down
between
her
and
it
edward
was
amusing
himself
he
often
called
upon
her
for
sympathy
which
she
as
readily
gave
i
wonder
how
men
make
their
boats
steady
i
have
taken
mine
to
the
pond
and
she
has
toppled
over
every
time
i
sent
her
in
has
it
that
very
tiresome
would
if
do
to
put
a
little
weight
in
it
to
keep
it
down
how
often
must
i
tell
you
to
call
a
ship
and
there
you
will
go
on
saying
it
it
after
this
correction
of
his
sister
master
edward
did
not
like
the
condescension
of
acknowledging
her
suggestion
to
be
a
good
one
so
he
went
silently
to
the
house
in
search
of
the
requisite
ballast
but
not
being
able
to
find
anything
suitable
he
came
back
to
his
turfy
hillock
littered
round
with
chips
of
wood
and
tried
to
insert
some
pebbles
into
his
vessel
but
they
stuck
fast
and
he
was
obliged
to
ask
again
supposing
it
was
a
good
thing
to
weight
her
what
could
i
put
in
maggie
thought
a
moment
would
shot
do
asked
she
it
would
be
the
very
thing
but
where
can
i
get
any
there
is
some
that
was
left
of
papa
it
is
in
the
corner
of
the
second
drawer
of
the
bureau
wrapped
up
in
a
newspaper
what
a
plague
i
ca
remember
your
and
and
he
worked
on
at
his
pebbles
they
would
hot
do
i
think
if
you
were
maggie
you
might
go
for
me
oh
ned
i
all
this
long
seam
to
do
mamma
said
i
must
finish
it
before
tea
and
that
i
might
play
a
little
if
i
had
done
if
first
said
maggie
rather
plaintively
for
it
was
a
real
pain
to
her
to
refuse
a
request
it
would
not
take
you
five
minutes
maggie
thought
a
little
the
time
would
only
be
taken
out
of
her
playing
which
after
all
did
not
signify
while
edward
was
really
busy
about
his
ship
she
rose
and
clambered
up
the
steep
grassy
slope
slippery
with
the
heat
before
she
had
found
the
paper
of
shot
she
heard
her
mother
voice
calling
in
a
sort
of
hushed
hurried
loudness
as
if
anxious
to
be
heard
by
one
person
yet
not
by
another
edward
edward
come
home
quickly
buxton
coming
along
the
he
coming
here
as
sure
as
sixpence
come
edward
come
maggie
saw
edward
put
down
his
ship
and
come
at
his
mother
bidding
it
certainly
was
but
he
strove
to
make
this
as
little
apparent
as
he
could
by
sauntering
up
the
slope
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
in
a
very
independent
and
style
maggie
had
no
time
to
watch
longer
for
now
she
was
called
too
and
down
stairs
she
ran
here
maggie
said
her
mother
in
a
nervous
hurry
help
nancy
to
get
a
tray
ready
all
in
a
minute
i
do
believe
here
buxton
coming
to
call
oh
edward
go
and
brush
your
hair
and
put
on
your
sunday
jacket
buxton
just
coming
round
i
only
run
up
and
change
my
cap
and
you
say
you
come
up
and
tell
me
nancy
all
proper
you
know
to
be
sure
i
lived
in
families
afore
now
said
nancy
gruffly
oh
yes
i
know
you
have
be
sure
you
bring
in
the
cowslip
wine
i
wish
i
could
have
stayed
to
decant
some
port
nancy
and
maggie
bustled
about
in
and
out
of
the
kitchen
and
dairy
and
were
so
deep
in
their
preparations
for
buxton
reception
that
they
were
not
aware
of
the
very
presence
of
that
gentleman
himself
on
the
scene
he
had
found
the
front
door
open
as
is
the
wont
in
country
places
and
had
walked
in
first
stopping
at
the
empty
parlor
and
then
finding
his
way
to
the
place
where
voices
and
sounds
proclaimed
that
there
were
inhabitants
so
he
stood
there
stooping
a
little
under
the
lintels
of
the
kitchen
door
and
looking
large
and
red
and
warm
but
with
a
pleased
and
almost
amused
expression
of
face
lord
bless
me
sir
what
a
start
you
gave
me
said
nancy
as
she
suddenly
caught
sight
of
him
i
go
and
tell
my
missus
in
a
minute
that
come
off
she
went
leaving
maggie
alone
with
the
great
tall
broad
gentleman
smiling
at
her
from
his
frame
in
the
but
never
speaking
she
went
on
dusting
a
most
assiduously
well
done
little
girl
came
out
a
fine
strong
voice
at
last
now
i
think
that
will
do
come
and
show
me
the
parlor
where
i
may
sit
down
for
i
had
a
long
walk
and
am
very
tired
maggie
took
him
into
the
parlor
which
was
always
cool
and
fresh
in
the
hottest
weather
it
was
scented
by
a
great
filled
with
roses
and
besides
the
casement
was
open
to
the
fragrant
court
buxton
was
so
large
and
the
parlor
so
small
that
when
he
was
once
in
maggie
thought
when
he
went
away
he
could
carry
the
room
on
his
back
as
a
snail
does
its
house
and
so
you
are
a
notable
little
woman
are
you
said
he
after
he
had
stretched
himself
a
very
unnecessary
proceeding
and
unbuttoned
his
waistcoat
maggie
stood
near
the
door
uncertain
whether
to
go
or
to
stay
how
bright
and
clean
you
were
making
that
glass
do
you
think
you
could
get
me
some
water
to
fill
it
mind
it
must
be
that
very
glass
i
saw
you
polishing
i
shall
know
it
again
maggie
was
thankful
to
escape
out
of
the
room
and
in
the
passage
she
met
her
mother
who
had
made
time
to
change
her
gown
as
well
as
her
cap
before
nancy
would
allow
the
little
girl
to
return
with
the
glass
of
water
she
smoothed
her
glossy
hair
it
was
all
that
was
needed
to
make
her
look
delicately
neat
maggie
was
conscientious
in
trying
to
find
out
the
identical
glass
but
i
am
afraid
nancy
was
not
quite
so
truthful
in
avouching
that
one
of
the
six
exactly
similar
which
were
now
placed
on
the
tray
was
the
same
she
had
found
on
the
dresser
when
she
came
back
from
telling
her
mistress
of
buxton
arrival
maggie
carried
in
the
water
with
a
shy
pride
in
the
clearness
of
the
glass
her
mother
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
speaking
in
unusually
fine
language
and
with
a
higher
pitched
voice
than
common
edward
in
all
his
sunday
glory
was
standing
by
buxton
looking
happy
and
conscious
but
when
maggie
came
in
buxton
made
room
for
her
between
edward
and
himself
and
while
she
went
on
talking
lifted
her
on
to
his
knee
she
sat
there
as
on
a
pinnacle
of
honor
but
as
she
durst
not
nestle
up
to
him
a
chair
would
have
been
the
more
comfortable
seat
as
founder
line
i
have
a
right
of
presentation
and
for
my
dear
old
friend
sake
here
browne
wiped
her
eyes
i
am
truly
glad
of
it
my
young
friend
will
have
a
little
form
of
examination
to
go
through
and
then
we
shall
see
him
carrying
every
prize
before
him
i
have
no
doubt
thank
you
just
a
little
of
your
sparkling
cowslip
wine
ah
this
gingerbread
is
like
the
gingerbread
i
had
when
i
was
a
boy
my
little
lady
here
must
learn
the
receipt
and
make
me
some
will
she
speak
to
buxton
child
who
is
kind
to
your
brother
you
will
make
him
some
gingerbread
i
am
sure
if
i
may
said
maggie
hanging
down
her
head
or
i
tell
you
what
suppose
you
come
to
my
house
and
teach
us
how
to
make
it
there
and
then
you
know
we
could
always
be
making
gingerbread
when
we
were
not
eating
it
that
would
be
best
i
think
must
i
ask
mamma
to
bring
you
down
to
combehurst
and
let
us
all
get
acquainted
together
i
have
a
great
boy
and
a
little
girl
at
home
who
will
like
to
see
you
sure
and
we
have
got
a
pony
for
you
to
ride
on
and
a
peacock
and
guinea
fowls
and
i
do
know
what
all
come
madam
let
me
persuade
you
school
begins
in
three
weeks
let
us
fix
a
day
before
then
do
mamma
said
edward
i
am
not
in
spirits
for
visiting
browne
answered
but
the
quick
children
detected
a
hesitation
in
her
manner
of
saying
the
oft
spoken
words
and
had
hopes
if
only
buxton
would
persevere
in
his
invitation
your
not
visiting
is
the
very
reason
why
you
are
not
in
spirits
a
little
change
and
a
few
neighborly
faces
would
do
you
good
i
be
bound
besides
for
the
children
sake
you
should
not
live
too
secluded
a
life
young
people
should
see
a
little
of
the
world
browne
was
much
obliged
to
buxton
for
giving
her
so
decent
an
excuse
for
following
her
inclination
which
it
must
be
owned
tended
to
the
acceptance
of
the
invitation
so
for
the
children
sake
she
consented
but
she
sighed
as
if
making
a
sacrifice
that
right
said
buxton
now
for
the
day
it
was
fixed
that
they
should
go
on
that
day
week
and
after
some
further
conversation
about
the
school
at
which
edward
was
to
be
placed
and
some
more
jokes
about
maggie
notability
and
an
inquiry
if
she
would
come
and
live
with
him
the
next
time
he
wanted
a
housemaid
buxton
took
his
leave
his
visit
had
been
an
event
and
they
made
no
great
attempt
at
settling
again
that
day
to
any
of
their
usual
employments
in
the
first
place
nancy
came
in
to
hear
and
discuss
all
the
proposed
plans
ned
who
was
uncertain
whether
to
like
or
dislike
the
prospect
of
school
was
very
much
offended
by
the
old
servant
remark
on
first
hearing
of
the
project
it
time
for
him
he
learn
his
place
there
which
it
strikes
me
he
and
others
too
are
apt
to
forget
at
home
then
followed
discussions
and
arrangements
respecting
his
clothes
and
then
they
came
to
the
plan
of
spending
a
day
at
buxton
which
browne
was
rather
shy
of
mentioning
having
a
sort
of
an
idea
of
inconstancy
and
guilt
connected
with
the
thought
of
mingling
with
the
world
again
however
nancy
approved
it
was
quite
right
and
just
as
it
should
be
and
good
for
the
children
yes
it
was
on
their
account
i
did
it
nancy
said
browne
how
many
children
has
mr
buxton
asked
edward
only
one
frank
i
think
they
call
him
but
you
must
say
master
buxton
be
sure
who
is
the
little
girl
then
asked
maggie
who
sits
with
them
in
church
oh
that
little
miss
harvey
his
niece
and
a
great
fortune
they
do
say
he
never
forgave
her
mother
till
the
day
of
her
death
remarked
nancy
then
they
tell
stories
nancy
replied
browne
it
was
she
herself
who
had
said
it
but
that
was
before
buxton
call
for
d
think
his
sister
would
have
left
him
guardian
to
her
child
if
they
were
not
on
good
terms
well
i
only
know
what
folks
say
and
for
sure
he
took
a
spite
at
harvey
for
no
reason
on
earth
and
every
one
knows
he
never
spoke
to
him
he
speaks
very
kindly
and
pleasantly
put
in
maggie
ay
and
i
not
saying
but
what
he
is
a
very
good
kind
man
in
the
main
but
he
has
his
whims
and
keeps
hold
on
when
he
got
there
them
pies
burning
and
i
talking
here
when
nancy
had
returned
to
her
kitchen
browne
called
maggie
up
stairs
to
examine
what
clothes
would
be
needed
for
edward
and
when
they
were
up
she
tried
on
the
black
satin
gown
which
had
been
her
visiting
dress
ever
since
she
was
married
and
which
she
intended
should
replace
the
old
bombazine
on
the
day
of
the
visit
to
combehurst
for
buxton
is
a
real
born
lady
said
she
and
i
should
like
to
be
well
dressed
to
do
her
honor
i
did
not
know
there
was
a
buxton
said
maggie
she
is
never
at
church
no
she
is
but
delicate
and
weakly
and
never
leaves
the
house
i
think
her
maid
told
me
she
never
left
her
room
now
the
buxton
family
root
and
branch
formed
the
de
in
the
conversation
between
browne
and
her
children
for
the
next
week
as
the
day
drew
near
maggie
almost
wished
to
stay
at
home
so
impressed
was
she
with
the
awfulness
of
the
visit
edward
felt
bold
in
the
idea
of
a
new
suit
of
clothes
which
had
been
ordered
for
the
occasion
and
for
school
afterwards
browne
remembered
having
heard
the
rector
say
a
woman
never
looked
so
as
when
she
wore
black
satin
and
kept
her
spirits
up
with
that
observation
but
when
she
saw
how
worn
it
was
at
the
elbows
she
felt
rather
depressed
and
unequal
to
visiting
still
for
her
children
sake
she
would
do
much
after
her
long
day
work
was
ended
nancy
sat
up
at
her
sewing
she
had
found
out
that
among
all
the
preparations
none
were
going
on
for
margaret
and
she
had
used
her
influence
over
her
mistress
who
and
and
entirely
depended
upon
her
to
obtain
from
her
an
old
gown
which
she
had
taken
to
pieces
and
washed
and
scoured
and
was
now
making
up
in
a
way
a
little
to
be
sure
but
on
the
whole
it
looked
so
nice
when
completed
and
put
on
that
browne
gave
maggie
a
strict
lecture
about
taking
great
care
of
such
a
handsome
frock
and
forgot
that
she
had
considered
the
gown
from
which
if
had
been
made
as
worn
out
and
done
for
chapter
ii
at
length
they
were
dressed
and
nancy
stood
on
the
shading
her
eyes
and
looking
after
them
as
they
climbed
the
heathery
slope
leading
to
combehurst
i
wish
she
take
her
hand
sometimes
just
to
let
her
know
the
feel
of
her
mother
hand
perhaps
she
will
at
least
after
master
edward
goes
to
school
as
they
went
along
browne
gave
the
children
a
few
rules
respecting
manners
and
etiquette
maggie
you
must
sit
as
upright
as
ever
you
can
make
your
back
flat
child
and
do
poke
if
i
cough
you
must
draw
up
i
shall
cough
whenever
i
see
you
do
anything
wrong
and
i
shall
be
looking
at
you
all
day
so
remember
you
hold
yourself
very
well
edward
if
buxton
asks
you
you
may
have
a
glass
of
wine
because
you
a
boy
but
mind
and
say
good
health
sir
before
you
drink
it
i
rather
not
have
the
wine
if
i
to
say
that
said
edward
bluntly
oh
nonsense
my
dear
you
wish
to
be
like
a
gentleman
i
sure
edward
muttered
something
which
was
inaudible
his
mother
went
on
of
course
you
never
think
of
being
helped
more
than
twice
twice
of
meat
twice
of
pudding
is
the
genteel
thing
you
may
take
less
but
never
more
oh
mamma
how
beautiful
combehurst
spire
is
with
that
dark
cloud
behind
it
exclaimed
maggie
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
town
you
no
business
with
combehurst
spire
when
i
speaking
to
you
talking
myself
out
of
breath
to
teach
you
how
to
behave
and
there
you
go
looking
after
clouds
and
such
like
rubbish
i
ashamed
of
you
although
maggie
walked
quietly
by
her
mother
side
all
the
rest
of
the
way
browne
was
too
much
offended
to
resume
her
instructions
on
maggie
might
be
helped
three
times
if
she
liked
she
had
done
with
her
they
were
very
early
when
they
drew
near
the
bridge
they
were
met
by
a
tall
boy
leading
a
beautiful
little
shetland
pony
with
a
on
it
he
came
up
to
browne
and
addressed
her
my
father
thought
your
little
girl
would
be
tired
and
he
told
me
to
bring
my
cousin
erminia
pony
for
her
it
as
quiet
as
can
be
now
this
was
rather
provoking
to
browne
as
she
chose
to
consider
maggie
in
disgrace
however
there
was
no
help
for
it
all
she
could
do
was
to
spoil
the
enjoyment
as
far
as
possible
by
looking
and
speaking
in
a
cold
manner
which
often
chilled
maggie
little
heart
and
took
all
the
zest
out
of
the
pleasure
now
it
was
in
vain
that
frank
buxton
made
the
pony
trot
and
canter
she
still
looked
sad
and
grave
little
dull
thing
he
thought
but
he
was
as
kind
and
considerate
as
a
gentlemanly
boy
could
be
at
last
they
reached
buxton
house
it
was
in
the
main
street
and
the
front
door
opened
upon
it
by
a
flight
of
steps
wide
on
each
side
extended
the
windows
it
was
in
reality
a
mansion
and
needed
not
the
neighboring
contrast
of
the
cottages
on
either
side
to
make
it
look
imposing
when
they
went
in
they
entered
a
large
hall
cool
even
on
that
burning
july
day
with
a
black
and
white
flag
floor
and
old
settees
round
the
walls
and
great
jars
of
curious
china
which
were
filled
with
the
dusky
gloom
was
pleasant
after
the
glare
of
the
street
outside
and
the
requisite
light
and
cheerfulness
were
given
by
the
peep
into
the
garden
framed
as
it
were
by
the
large
that
opened
into
it
there
were
roses
and
and
poppies
a
rich
mass
of
color
which
looked
well
set
in
the
somewhat
sombre
coolness
of
the
hall
all
the
house
told
of
wealth
wealth
which
had
accumulated
for
generations
and
which
was
shown
in
a
sort
of
comfortable
grand
unostentatious
way
buxton
ancestors
had
been
yeomen
but
two
or
three
generations
back
they
might
if
ambitious
have
taken
their
place
as
country
gentry
so
much
had
the
value
of
their
property
increased
and
so
great
had
been
the
amount
of
their
savings
they
however
continued
to
live
in
the
old
farm
till
buxton
grandfather
built
the
house
in
combehurst
of
which
i
am
speaking
and
then
he
felt
rather
ashamed
of
what
he
had
done
it
seemed
like
stepping
out
of
his
position
he
and
his
wife
always
sat
in
the
best
kitchen
and
it
was
only
after
his
son
marriage
that
the
entertaining
rooms
were
furnished
even
then
they
were
kept
with
closed
shutters
and
furniture
during
the
lifetime
of
the
old
couple
who
nevertheless
took
a
pride
in
adding
to
the
ornaments
and
grand
old
china
of
the
apartments
but
they
died
and
were
gathered
to
their
fathers
and
young
and
buxton
aged
respectively
and
reigned
in
their
stead
they
had
the
good
taste
to
make
no
sudden
change
but
gradually
the
rooms
assumed
an
inhabited
appearance
and
their
son
and
daughter
grew
up
in
the
enjoyment
of
great
wealth
and
no
small
degree
of
refinement
but
as
yet
they
held
back
modestly
from
putting
themselves
in
any
way
on
a
level
with
the
county
people
lawrence
buxton
was
sent
to
the
same
school
as
his
father
had
been
before
him
and
the
notion
of
his
going
to
college
to
complete
his
education
was
after
some
deliberation
negatived
in
process
of
time
he
succeeded
his
father
and
married
a
sweet
gentle
lady
of
a
decayed
and
very
poor
county
family
by
whom
he
had
one
boy
before
she
fell
into
delicate
health
his
sister
had
married
a
man
whose
character
was
worse
than
his
fortune
and
had
been
left
a
widow
everybody
thought
her
husband
death
a
blessing
but
she
loved
him
in
spite
of
negligence
and
many
grosser
faults
and
so
not
many
years
after
she
died
leaving
her
little
daughter
to
her
brother
care
with
many
a
entreaty
that
he
would
never
speak
a
word
against
the
dead
father
of
her
child
so
the
little
erminia
was
taken
home
by
her
uncle
who
felt
now
how
hardly
he
had
acted
towards
his
sister
in
breaking
off
all
communication
with
her
on
her
marriage
where
is
erminia
frank
asked
his
father
speaking
over
shoulder
while
he
still
held
her
hand
i
want
to
take
browne
to
your
mother
i
told
erminia
to
be
here
to
welcome
this
little
girl
i
take
her
to
minnie
i
think
she
in
the
garden
i
come
back
to
you
nodding
to
edward
directly
and
then
we
will
go
to
the
rabbits
so
frank
and
maggie
left
the
great
lofty
room
full
of
strange
rare
things
and
rich
with
books
and
went
into
the
sunny
scented
garden
which
stretched
far
and
wide
behind
the
house
down
one
of
the
walks
with
a
hedge
of
roses
on
either
side
came
a
little
tripping
fairy
with
long
golden
ringlets
and
a
complexion
like
a
china
rose
with
the
deep
blue
of
the
summer
sky
behind
her
maggie
thought
she
looked
like
an
angel
she
neither
hastened
nor
slackened
her
pace
when
she
saw
them
but
came
on
with
the
same
dainty
light
prancing
step
make
haste
minnie
cried
frank
but
minnie
stopped
to
gather
a
rose
do
stay
with
me
said
maggie
softly
although
she
had
held
his
hand
like
that
of
a
friend
and
did
not
feel
that
the
little
fairy
manner
was
particularly
cordial
or
gracious
frank
took
her
at
her
word
and
ran
off
to
edward
erminia
came
a
little
quicker
when
she
saw
that
maggie
was
left
alone
but
for
some
time
after
they
were
together
they
had
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
erminia
was
easily
impressed
by
the
pomps
and
vanities
of
the
world
and
maggie
new
handsome
frock
seemed
to
her
made
of
old
ironed
brown
silk
and
though
maggie
voice
was
soft
with
a
silver
ringing
sound
in
it
she
pronounced
her
words
in
nancy
broad
country
way
her
hair
was
cut
short
all
round
her
shoes
were
thick
and
clumped
as
she
walked
erminia
patronized
her
and
thought
herself
very
kind
and
condescending
but
they
were
not
particularly
friendly
the
visit
promised
to
be
more
honorable
than
agreeable
and
maggie
almost
wished
herself
at
home
again
came
buxton
dined
in
her
own
room
buxton
was
hearty
and
jovial
and
pressing
he
almost
scolded
maggie
because
she
would
not
take
more
than
twice
of
his
favorite
pudding
but
she
remembered
what
her
mother
had
said
and
that
she
would
be
watched
all
day
and
this
gave
her
a
little
prim
quaint
manner
very
different
from
her
usual
soft
charming
unconsciousness
she
fancied
that
edward
and
master
buxton
were
just
as
little
at
their
ease
with
each
other
as
she
and
miss
harvey
perhaps
this
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
boys
made
all
four
children
unite
after
dinner
let
us
go
to
the
swing
in
the
shrubbery
said
frank
after
a
little
consideration
and
off
they
ran
frank
proposed
that
he
and
edward
should
swing
the
two
little
girls
and
for
a
time
all
went
on
very
well
but
edward
thought
that
maggie
had
had
enough
and
that
he
should
like
a
turn
and
maggie
at
his
first
word
got
out
do
you
like
swinging
asked
erminia
yes
but
edward
would
like
it
now
and
edward
accordingly
took
her
place
frank
turned
away
and
would
not
swing
him
maggie
strove
hard
to
do
it
but
he
was
heavy
and
the
swing
bent
unevenly
he
scolded
her
for
what
she
could
not
help
and
at
last
jumped
out
so
roughly
that
the
seat
hit
maggie
face
and
knocked
her
down
when
she
got
up
her
lips
quivered
with
pain
but
she
did
not
cry
she
only
looked
anxiously
at
her
frock
there
was
a
great
rent
across
the
front
breadth
then
she
did
shed
tears
tears
of
fright
what
would
her
mother
say
erminia
saw
her
crying
are
you
hurt
said
she
kindly
oh
how
your
check
is
swelled
what
a
rude
cross
boy
your
brother
is
i
did
not
know
he
was
going
to
jump
out
i
am
not
crying
because
i
am
hurt
but
because
of
this
great
rent
in
my
nice
new
frock
mamma
will
be
so
displeased
is
it
a
new
frock
asked
erminia
it
is
a
new
one
for
me
nancy
has
sat
up
several
nights
to
make
it
oh
what
shall
i
do
erminia
little
heart
was
softened
by
such
excessive
poverty
a
best
frock
made
of
shabby
old
silk
she
put
her
arms
round
maggie
neck
and
said
come
with
me
we
will
go
to
my
aunt
and
dawson
will
give
me
some
silk
and
i
help
you
to
mend
it
that
a
kind
little
minnie
said
frank
ned
had
turned
sulkily
away
i
do
not
think
the
boys
were
ever
cordial
again
that
day
for
as
frank
said
to
his
mother
ned
might
have
said
he
was
sorry
but
he
is
a
regular
tyrant
to
that
little
brown
mouse
of
a
sister
of
his
erminia
and
maggie
went
with
their
arms
round
each
other
necks
to
buxton
the
misfortune
had
made
them
friends
buxton
lay
on
the
sofa
so
fair
and
white
and
colorless
in
her
muslin
that
when
maggie
first
saw
the
lady
lying
with
her
eyes
shut
her
heart
gave
a
start
for
she
thought
she
was
dead
but
she
opened
her
large
languid
eyes
and
called
them
to
her
and
listened
to
their
story
with
interest
dawson
is
at
tea
look
minnie
in
my
there
is
some
silk
there
take
off
your
frock
my
dear
and
bring
it
here
and
let
me
see
how
it
can
be
mended
aunt
buxton
whispered
erminia
do
let
me
give
her
one
of
my
frocks
this
is
such
an
old
thing
no
love
i
tell
you
why
afterwards
answered
buxton
she
looked
at
the
rent
and
arranged
if
nicely
for
the
little
girls
to
mend
erminia
helped
maggie
with
right
good
will
as
they
sat
on
the
floor
buxton
thought
what
a
pretty
contrast
they
made
erminia
dazzlingly
fair
with
her
golden
ringlets
and
her
frock
maggie
little
round
white
shoulders
peeping
out
of
her
petticoat
her
brown
hair
as
glossy
and
smooth
as
the
nuts
that
it
resembled
in
color
her
long
black
drooping
over
her
clear
smooth
cheek
which
would
have
given
the
idea
of
delicacy
but
for
the
coral
lips
that
spoke
of
perfect
health
and
when
she
glanced
up
she
showed
long
liquid
eyes
the
deep
red
of
the
curtain
behind
threw
out
these
two
little
figures
well
dawson
came
up
she
was
a
grave
elderly
person
of
whom
erminia
was
far
more
afraid
than
she
was
of
her
aunt
but
at
buxton
desire
she
finished
mending
the
frock
for
maggie
buxton
has
asked
some
of
your
mamma
old
friends
to
tea
as
i
am
not
able
to
go
down
but
i
think
dawson
i
must
have
these
two
little
girls
to
tea
with
me
can
you
be
very
quiet
my
dears
or
shall
you
think
it
dull
they
gladly
accepted
the
invitation
and
erminia
promised
all
sorts
of
fanciful
promises
as
to
quietness
and
went
about
on
her
tiptoes
in
such
a
labored
manner
that
buxton
begged
her
at
last
not
to
try
and
be
quiet
as
she
made
much
less
noise
when
she
did
not
it
was
the
happiest
part
of
the
day
to
maggie
something
in
herself
was
so
much
in
harmony
with
buxton
sweet
resigned
gentleness
that
it
answered
like
an
echo
and
the
two
understood
each
other
strangely
well
they
seemed
like
old
friends
maggie
who
was
reserved
at
home
because
no
one
cared
to
hear
what
she
had
to
say
opened
out
and
told
erminia
and
buxton
all
about
her
way
of
spending
her
day
and
described
her
home
how
odd
said
erminia
i
have
ridden
that
way
on
and
never
seen
your
house
it
is
like
the
place
the
sleeping
beauty
lived
in
people
sometimes
seem
to
go
round
it
and
round
it
and
never
find
it
but
unless
you
follow
a
little
which
seems
to
end
at
a
gray
piece
of
rock
you
may
come
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
chimneys
and
never
see
them
i
think
you
would
think
it
so
pretty
do
you
ever
come
that
way
no
love
answered
buxton
but
will
you
some
time
i
am
afraid
i
shall
never
be
able
to
go
out
again
said
buxton
in
a
voice
which
though
low
was
very
cheerful
maggie
thought
how
sad
a
lot
was
here
before
her
and
she
took
a
little
stool
and
sat
by
buxton
sofa
and
stole
her
hand
into
hers
browne
was
in
full
tide
of
pride
and
happiness
down
stairs
buxton
had
a
number
of
jokes
which
would
have
become
dull
from
repetition
for
he
worked
a
merry
idea
threadbare
before
he
would
let
if
go
had
if
not
been
for
his
jovial
blandness
and
he
liked
to
make
people
happy
and
as
far
as
bodily
wants
went
he
had
a
quick
perception
of
what
was
required
he
sat
like
a
king
for
excepting
the
rector
there
was
not
another
gentleman
of
his
standing
at
combehurst
among
six
or
seven
ladies
who
laughed
merrily
at
all
his
sayings
and
evidently
thought
browne
had
been
highly
honored
in
having
been
asked
to
dinner
as
well
as
to
tea
in
the
evening
the
carriage
was
ordered
to
take
her
as
far
as
a
carriage
could
go
and
there
was
a
little
mysterious
handshaking
between
her
host
and
herself
on
taking
leave
which
made
her
very
curious
for
the
lights
of
home
by
which
to
examine
a
bit
of
rustling
paper
that
had
been
put
in
her
hand
with
some
words
about
edward
when
every
one
had
gone
there
was
a
little
gathering
in
husband
son
and
niece
all
came
to
give
her
their
opinions
on
the
day
and
the
visitors
good
browne
is
a
little
tiresome
said
buxton
yawning
living
in
that
moorland
hole
i
suppose
however
i
think
she
has
enjoyed
her
day
and
we
ask
her
down
now
and
then
for
browne
sake
poor
browne
what
a
good
man
he
was
i
do
like
that
boy
at
all
said
frank
i
beg
you
not
ask
him
again
while
i
at
home
he
is
so
selfish
and
and
yet
he
a
bit
snobbish
now
and
then
mother
i
know
what
you
mean
by
that
look
well
if
i
am
sometimes
i
not
a
snob
little
maggie
is
very
nice
said
erminia
what
a
pity
she
has
not
a
new
frock
was
not
she
good
about
it
frank
when
she
tore
it
yes
she
a
nice
little
thing
enough
if
she
does
not
get
all
spirit
cowed
out
of
her
by
that
brother
i
thankful
that
he
is
going
to
school
when
browne
heard
where
maggie
had
drank
tea
she
was
offended
she
had
only
sat
with
buxton
for
an
hour
before
dinner
if
buxton
could
bear
the
noise
of
children
she
could
not
think
why
she
shut
herself
up
in
that
room
and
gave
herself
such
airs
she
supposed
it
was
because
she
was
the
granddaughter
of
sir
henry
biddulph
that
she
took
upon
herself
to
have
such
whims
and
not
sit
at
the
head
of
her
table
or
make
tea
for
her
company
in
a
civil
decent
way
poor
buxton
what
a
sad
life
for
a
merry
man
to
have
such
a
wife
it
was
a
good
thing
for
him
to
have
agreeable
society
sometimes
she
thought
he
looked
a
deal
better
for
seeing
his
friends
he
must
be
sadly
moped
with
that
sickly
wife
if
she
had
been
clairvoyante
at
that
moment
she
might
have
seen
buxton
tenderly
chafing
his
wife
hands
and
feeling
in
his
innermost
soul
a
wonder
how
one
so
could
ever
have
learnt
to
love
such
a
boor
as
he
was
it
was
the
wonderful
mysterious
blessing
of
his
life
so
little
do
we
know
of
the
inner
truths
of
the
households
where
we
come
and
go
like
intimate
guests
maggie
could
not
bear
to
hear
buxton
spoken
of
as
a
fine
lady
assuming
illness
her
heart
beat
hard
as
she
spoke
mamma
i
am
sure
she
is
really
ill
her
lips
kept
going
so
white
and
her
hand
was
so
burning
hot
all
the
time
that
i
held
it
have
you
been
holding
buxton
hand
where
were
your
manners
you
are
a
little
forward
creature
and
ever
were
but
do
pretend
to
know
better
than
your
elders
it
is
no
use
telling
me
buxton
is
ill
and
she
able
to
bear
the
noise
of
children
i
think
they
are
all
a
pack
of
people
and
that
frank
buxton
is
the
worst
of
all
said
edward
maggie
heart
sank
within
her
to
hear
this
cold
unkind
way
of
talking
over
the
friends
who
had
done
so
much
to
make
their
day
happy
she
had
never
before
ventured
into
the
world
and
did
not
know
how
common
and
universal
is
the
custom
of
picking
to
pieces
those
with
whom
we
have
just
been
associating
and
so
it
pained
her
she
was
a
little
depressed
too
with
the
idea
that
she
should
never
see
buxton
and
the
lovely
erminia
again
because
no
future
visit
or
intercourse
had
been
spoken
about
she
fancied
it
would
never
take
place
and
she
felt
like
the
man
in
the
arabian
nights
who
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
precious
stones
and
dazzling
glories
of
the
cavern
which
was
immediately
after
closed
and
shut
up
into
the
semblance
of
hard
barren
rock
she
tried
to
recall
the
house
deep
blue
crimson
red
warm
brown
draperies
were
so
striking
after
the
light
chintzes
of
her
own
house
and
the
effect
of
a
suite
of
rooms
opening
out
of
each
other
was
something
quite
new
to
the
little
girl
the
apartments
seemed
to
melt
away
into
vague
distance
like
the
dim
endings
of
the
arched
aisles
in
church
but
most
of
all
she
tried
to
recall
buxton
face
and
nancy
had
at
last
to
put
away
her
work
and
come
to
bed
in
order
to
soothe
the
poor
child
who
was
crying
at
the
thought
that
buxton
would
soon
die
and
that
she
should
never
see
her
again
nancy
loved
maggie
dearly
and
felt
no
jealousy
of
this
warm
admiration
of
the
unknown
lady
she
listened
to
her
story
and
her
fears
till
the
sobs
were
hushed
and
the
moon
fell
through
the
casement
on
the
white
closed
eyelids
of
one
who
still
sighed
in
her
sleep
chapter
iii
in
three
weeks
the
day
came
for
edward
departure
a
great
cake
and
a
parcel
of
gingerbread
soothed
his
sorrows
on
leaving
home
do
cry
maggie
said
he
to
her
on
the
last
morning
you
see
i
do
christmas
will
soon
be
here
and
i
dare
say
i
shall
find
time
to
write
to
you
now
and
then
did
nancy
put
any
citron
in
the
cake
maggie
wished
she
might
accompany
her
mother
to
combehurst
to
see
edward
off
by
the
coach
but
it
was
not
to
be
she
went
with
them
without
her
bonnet
as
far
as
her
mother
would
allow
her
and
then
she
sat
down
and
watched
their
progress
for
a
long
long
way
she
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
a
horse
feet
softly
trampling
through
the
long
heather
it
was
frank
buxton
my
father
thought
browne
would
like
to
see
the
woodchester
herald
is
edward
gone
said
he
noticing
her
sad
face
yes
he
is
just
gone
down
the
hill
to
the
coach
i
dare
say
you
can
see
him
crossing
the
bridge
soon
i
did
so
want
to
have
gone
with
him
answered
she
looking
wistfully
toward
the
town
frank
felt
sorry
for
her
left
alone
to
gaze
after
her
brother
whom
strange
as
it
was
she
evidently
regretted
after
a
minute
silence
he
said
you
liked
riding
the
other
day
would
you
like
a
ride
now
rhoda
is
very
gentle
if
you
can
sit
on
my
saddle
look
i
shorten
the
stirrup
there
now
there
a
brave
little
girl
i
lead
her
very
carefully
why
erminia
durst
not
ride
without
a
i
tell
you
what
bring
the
newspaper
every
wednesday
till
i
go
to
school
and
you
shall
have
a
ride
only
i
wish
we
had
a
for
rhoda
or
if
erminia
will
let
me
i
bring
the
little
shetland
you
rode
the
other
day
but
will
buxton
let
you
asked
maggie
half
delighted
half
afraid
oh
my
father
to
be
sure
he
will
i
have
him
in
very
good
order
maggie
was
rather
puzzled
by
this
way
of
speaking
when
do
you
go
to
school
asked
she
toward
the
end
of
august
i
do
know
the
day
does
erminia
go
to
school
no
i
believe
she
will
soon
though
if
mamma
does
not
get
better
maggie
liked
the
change
of
voice
as
he
spoke
of
his
mother
there
little
lady
now
jump
down
famous
you
a
deal
of
spirit
you
little
brown
mouse
nancy
came
out
with
a
wondering
look
to
receive
maggie
it
is
frank
buxton
said
she
by
way
of
an
introduction
he
has
brought
mamma
the
newspaper
will
you
walk
in
sir
and
rest
i
can
tie
up
your
horse
no
thank
you
said
he
i
must
be
off
do
forget
little
mousey
that
you
are
to
ready
for
another
ride
next
wednesday
and
away
he
went
it
needed
a
good
deal
of
nancy
diplomacy
to
procure
maggie
this
pleasure
although
i
do
know
why
browne
should
have
denied
it
for
the
circle
they
went
was
always
within
sight
of
the
knoll
in
front
of
the
house
if
any
one
cared
enough
about
the
matter
to
mount
it
and
look
after
them
frank
and
maggie
got
great
friends
in
these
rides
her
fearlessness
delighted
and
surprised
him
she
had
seemed
so
cowed
and
timid
at
first
but
she
was
only
so
with
people
as
he
found
out
before
holidays
ended
he
saw
her
shrink
from
particular
looks
and
inflexions
of
voice
of
her
mother
and
learnt
to
read
them
and
dislike
browne
accordingly
notwithstanding
all
her
sugary
manner
toward
himself
the
result
of
his
observations
he
communicated
to
his
mother
and
in
consequence
he
was
the
bearer
of
a
most
civil
and
ceremonious
message
from
buxton
to
browne
to
the
effect
that
the
former
would
be
much
obliged
to
the
latter
if
she
would
allow
maggie
to
ride
down
occasionally
with
the
groom
who
would
bring
the
newspapers
on
the
wednesdays
now
frank
was
going
to
school
and
to
spend
the
afternoon
with
erminia
browne
consented
proud
of
the
honor
and
yet
a
little
annoyed
that
no
mention
was
made
of
herself
when
frank
had
bid
and
fairly
disappeared
she
turned
to
maggie
you
must
not
set
yourself
up
if
you
go
among
these
fine
folks
it
is
their
way
of
showing
attention
to
your
father
and
myself
and
you
must
mind
and
work
doubly
hard
on
thursdays
to
make
up
for
playing
on
wednesdays
maggie
was
in
a
flush
of
sudden
color
and
a
happy
palpitation
of
her
fluttering
little
heart
she
could
hardly
feel
any
sorrow
that
the
kind
frank
was
going
away
so
brimful
was
she
of
the
thoughts
of
seeing
his
mother
who
had
grown
strangely
associated
in
her
dreams
both
sleeping
and
waking
with
the
still
calm
marble
effigies
that
lay
for
ever
clasping
their
hands
in
prayer
on
the
in
combehurst
church
all
the
week
was
one
happy
season
of
anticipation
she
was
afraid
her
mother
was
secretly
irritated
at
her
natural
rejoicing
and
so
she
did
not
speak
to
her
about
it
but
she
kept
awake
till
nancy
came
to
bed
and
poured
into
her
sympathizing
ears
every
detail
real
or
imaginary
of
her
past
or
future
intercourse
with
buxton
and
the
old
servant
listened
with
interest
and
fell
into
the
custom
of
picturing
the
future
with
the
ease
and
simplicity
of
a
child
suppose
nancy
only
suppose
you
know
that
she
did
die
i
do
mean
really
die
but
go
into
a
trance
like
death
she
looked
as
if
she
was
in
one
when
i
first
saw
her
i
would
not
leave
her
but
i
would
sit
by
her
and
watch
her
and
watch
her
her
lips
would
be
always
fresh
and
red
interrupted
nancy
yes
i
know
you
told
me
before
how
they
keep
red
i
should
look
at
them
quite
steadily
i
would
try
never
to
go
to
sleep
the
great
thing
would
be
to
have
left
in
the
coffin
but
nancy
felt
the
little
girl
creep
close
to
her
at
the
grim
suggestion
and
with
the
tact
of
love
she
changed
the
subject
or
supposing
we
could
hear
of
a
doctor
who
could
charm
away
illness
there
were
such
in
my
young
days
but
i
do
think
people
are
so
knowledgeable
now
peggy
jackson
that
lived
near
us
when
i
was
a
girl
was
cured
of
a
waste
by
a
charm
what
is
a
waste
nancy
it
is
just
a
pining
away
food
does
not
nourish
nor
drink
strengthen
them
but
they
just
fade
off
and
grow
thinner
and
thinner
till
their
shadow
looks
gray
instead
of
black
at
noonday
but
he
cured
her
in
no
time
by
a
charm
oh
if
we
could
find
him
lass
he
dead
and
she
dead
too
long
ago
while
maggie
was
in
imagination
going
over
moor
and
fell
into
the
hollows
of
the
distant
mysterious
hills
where
she
imagined
all
strange
beasts
and
weird
people
to
haunt
she
fell
asleep
such
were
the
fanciful
thoughts
which
were
engendered
in
the
little
mind
by
her
secluded
and
solitary
life
it
was
more
solitary
than
ever
now
that
edward
was
gone
to
school
the
house
missed
his
loud
cheerful
voice
and
bursting
presence
there
seemed
much
less
to
be
done
now
that
his
numerous
wants
no
longer
called
for
ministration
and
attendance
maggie
did
her
task
of
work
on
her
own
gray
rock
but
as
it
was
sooner
finished
now
that
he
was
not
there
to
interrupt
and
call
her
off
she
used
to
stray
up
the
fell
lane
at
the
back
of
the
house
a
little
steep
stony
lane
more
like
stairs
cut
in
the
rock
than
what
we
in
the
level
land
call
a
lane
it
reached
on
to
the
wide
and
open
moor
and
near
its
termination
there
was
a
knotted
the
only
tree
for
apparent
miles
here
the
sheep
crouched
under
the
storms
or
stood
and
shaded
themselves
in
the
noontide
heat
the
ground
was
brown
with
their
cleft
round
and
tufts
of
wool
were
hung
on
the
lower
part
of
the
stem
like
votive
offerings
on
some
shrine
here
maggie
used
to
come
and
sit
and
dream
in
any
scarce
of
leisure
here
she
came
to
cry
when
her
little
heart
was
overfull
at
her
mother
sharp
or
when
bidden
to
keep
out
of
the
way
and
not
be
troublesome
she
used
to
look
over
the
swelling
expanse
of
moor
and
the
tears
were
dried
up
by
the
soft
wind
which
came
sighing
along
it
she
forgot
her
little
home
griefs
to
wonder
why
a
shadow
always
streaked
one
particular
part
in
the
fullest
sunlight
why
the
always
seemed
to
be
wafted
with
a
sidelong
motion
or
she
would
imagine
what
lay
beyond
those
old
gray
holy
hills
which
seemed
to
bear
up
the
white
clouds
of
heaven
on
which
the
angels
flew
abroad
or
she
would
look
straight
up
through
the
quivering
air
as
long
as
she
could
bear
its
white
dazzling
to
try
and
see
god
throne
in
that
unfathomable
and
infinite
depth
of
blue
she
thought
she
should
see
it
blaze
forth
sudden
and
glorious
if
she
were
but
full
of
faith
she
always
came
down
from
the
thorn
comforted
and
meekly
gentle
but
there
was
danger
of
the
child
becoming
dreamy
and
finding
her
pleasure
in
life
in
reverie
not
in
action
or
endurance
or
the
holy
rest
which
comes
after
both
and
prepares
for
further
striving
or
bearing
buxton
kindness
prevented
this
danger
just
in
time
it
was
partly
out
of
interest
in
maggie
but
also
partly
to
give
erminia
a
companion
that
she
wished
the
former
to
come
down
to
combehurst
when
she
was
on
these
visits
she
received
no
regular
instruction
and
yet
all
the
knowledge
and
most
of
the
strength
of
her
character
was
derived
from
these
occasional
hours
it
is
true
her
mother
had
given
her
daily
lessons
in
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
but
both
teacher
and
taught
felt
these
more
as
painful
duties
to
be
gone
through
than
understood
them
as
means
to
an
end
the
there
child
now
that
done
with
of
relief
from
browne
was
heartily
echoed
in
maggie
breast
as
the
dull
routine
was
concluded
buxton
did
not
make
a
set
labor
of
teaching
i
suppose
she
felt
that
much
was
learned
from
her
superintendence
but
she
never
thought
of
doing
or
saying
anything
with
a
latent
idea
of
its
indirect
effect
upon
the
little
girls
her
companions
she
was
simply
herself
she
even
confessed
where
the
confession
was
called
for
to
to
faults
and
never
denied
the
force
of
temptations
either
of
those
which
beset
little
children
or
of
those
which
occasionally
assailed
herself
pure
simple
and
truthful
to
the
heart
core
her
life
in
its
uneventful
hours
and
days
spoke
many
homilies
maggie
who
was
grave
imaginative
and
somewhat
quaint
took
pains
in
finding
words
to
express
the
thoughts
to
which
her
solitary
life
had
given
rise
secure
of
buxton
ready
understanding
and
sympathy
you
are
so
like
a
cloud
said
she
to
buxton
up
at
the
it
was
quite
curious
how
the
clouds
used
to
shape
themselves
just
according
as
i
was
glad
or
sorry
i
have
seen
the
same
clouds
that
when
i
came
up
first
looked
like
a
heap
of
little
over
graves
turn
as
soon
as
i
grew
happier
to
a
sort
of
long
bright
row
of
angels
and
you
seem
always
to
have
had
some
sorrow
when
i
am
sad
and
turn
bright
and
hopeful
as
soon
as
i
grow
glad
dear
buxton
i
wish
nancy
knew
you
the
gay
volatile
willful
erminia
was
less
earnest
in
all
things
her
childhood
had
been
passed
amid
the
distractions
of
wealth
and
passionately
bent
upon
the
attainment
of
some
object
at
one
moment
the
next
found
her
angry
at
being
reminded
of
the
vanished
anxiety
she
had
shown
but
a
moment
before
her
life
was
a
shattered
mirror
every
part
dazzling
and
brilliant
but
wanting
the
coherency
and
perfection
of
a
whole
buxton
strove
to
bring
her
to
a
sense
of
the
beauty
of
completeness
and
the
relation
which
qualities
and
objects
bear
to
each
other
but
in
all
her
striving
she
retained
hold
of
the
golden
clue
of
sympathy
she
would
enter
into
erminia
eagerness
if
the
object
of
it
varied
twenty
times
a
day
but
in
her
own
mild
sweet
suggestive
way
she
would
place
all
these
objects
in
their
right
and
fitting
places
as
they
were
worthy
of
desire
i
do
not
know
how
it
was
but
all
discords
and
disordered
fragments
seemed
to
fall
into
harmony
and
order
before
her
presence
she
had
no
wish
to
make
the
two
little
girls
into
the
same
kind
of
pattern
character
they
were
diverse
as
the
lily
and
the
rose
but
she
tried
to
give
stability
and
earnestness
to
erminia
while
she
aimed
to
direct
maggie
imagination
so
as
to
make
it
a
great
minister
to
high
ends
instead
of
simply
contributing
to
the
vividness
and
duration
of
a
reverie
she
told
her
tales
of
saints
and
martyrs
and
all
holy
heroines
who
forgot
themselves
and
strove
only
to
be
ministers
of
him
to
do
his
pleasure
the
tears
glistened
in
the
eyes
of
hearer
and
speaker
while
she
spoke
in
her
low
faint
voice
which
was
almost
choked
at
times
when
she
came
to
the
noblest
part
of
all
but
when
she
found
that
maggie
was
in
danger
of
becoming
too
little
a
dweller
in
the
present
from
the
habit
of
anticipating
the
occasion
for
some
great
heroic
action
she
spoke
of
other
heroines
she
told
her
how
though
the
lives
of
these
women
of
old
were
only
known
to
us
through
some
striking
glorious
deed
they
yet
must
have
built
up
the
temple
of
their
perfection
by
many
noiseless
stories
how
by
small
daily
offerings
laid
on
the
altar
they
must
have
obtained
their
beautiful
strength
for
the
crowning
sacrifice
and
then
she
would
turn
and
speak
of
those
whose
names
will
never
be
blazoned
on
earth
some
poor
or
artisan
or
weary
governess
who
have
gone
on
through
life
quietly
with
holy
purposes
in
their
hearts
to
which
they
gave
up
pleasure
and
ease
in
a
soft
still
succession
of
resolute
days
she
quoted
those
lines
of
george
herbert
all
may
have
if
they
dare
choose
a
glorious
life
or
grave
and
maggie
mother
was
disappointed
because
buxton
had
never
offered
to
teach
her
to
play
on
the
piano
which
was
to
her
the
very
head
and
front
of
a
genteel
education
maggie
in
all
her
time
of
yearning
to
become
joan
of
arc
or
some
great
heroine
was
unconscious
that
she
herself
showed
no
little
heroism
in
bearing
meekly
what
she
did
every
day
from
her
mother
it
was
hard
to
be
questioned
about
buxton
and
then
to
have
her
answers
turned
into
subjects
for
contempt
and
with
that
sweet
lady
ways
when
ned
came
home
for
the
holidays
he
had
much
to
tell
his
mother
listened
for
hours
to
his
tales
and
proudly
marked
all
that
she
could
note
of
his
progress
in
learning
his
and
were
a
sight
to
behold
and
his
contained
towers
and
pyramids
of
figures
ay
ay
said
buxton
when
they
were
shown
to
him
this
is
grand
when
i
was
a
boy
i
could
make
a
flying
eagle
with
one
stroke
of
my
pen
but
i
never
could
do
all
this
and
yet
i
thought
myself
a
fine
fellow
i
warrant
you
and
these
sums
why
man
i
must
make
you
my
agent
i
need
one
i
sure
for
though
i
get
an
accountant
every
two
or
three
years
to
do
up
my
books
they
somehow
have
the
knack
of
getting
wrong
again
those
quarries
browne
which
every
one
says
are
so
valuable
and
for
the
stone
out
of
which
receive
orders
amounting
to
hundreds
of
pounds
what
d
think
was
the
profit
i
made
last
year
according
to
my
books
i
sure
i
do
know
sir
something
very
great
i
no
doubt
just
three
farthings
said
he
bursting
into
a
fit
of
merry
laughter
such
as
another
man
would
have
kept
for
the
announcement
of
enormous
profits
but
i
must
manage
things
differently
soon
frank
will
want
money
when
he
goes
to
oxford
and
he
shall
have
it
i
but
a
rough
sort
of
fellow
but
frank
shall
take
his
place
as
a
gentleman
aha
miss
maggie
and
where
my
gingerbread
there
you
go
creeping
up
to
buxton
on
a
wednesday
and
have
never
taught
cook
how
to
make
gingerbread
yet
well
ned
and
how
are
the
classics
going
on
fine
fellow
that
virgil
let
me
see
how
does
it
begin
virumque
cano
trojae
qui
primus
ab
oris
that
pretty
well
i
think
considering
i
never
opened
him
since
i
left
school
thirty
years
ago
to
be
sure
i
spent
six
hours
a
day
at
it
when
i
was
there
come
now
i
puzzle
you
can
you
construe
this
infir
dealis
inoak
noneis
inmud
eelis
inclay
noneis
to
be
sure
i
can
said
edward
with
a
little
contempt
in
his
tone
can
you
do
this
sir
apud
in
is
almi
des
ire
mimis
tres
i
neve
require
alo

findit
a
gestis
his
miseri
ne
ver
at
restis
but
though
edward
had
made
much
progress
and
gained
three
prizes
his
moral
training
had
been
little
attended
to
he
was
more
tyrannical
than
ever
both
to
his
mother
and
maggie
it
was
a
drawn
battle
between
him
and
nancy
and
they
kept
aloof
from
each
other
as
much
as
possible
maggie
fell
into
her
old
humble
way
of
submitting
to
his
will
as
long
as
it
did
not
go
against
her
conscience
but
that
being
daily
enlightened
by
her
habits
of
pious
aspiring
thought
would
not
allow
her
to
be
so
utterly
obedient
as
formerly
in
addition
to
his
imperiousness
he
had
learned
to
affix
the
idea
of
cleverness
to
various
artifices
and
subterfuges
which
utterly
revolted
her
by
their
meanness
you
are
so
set
up
by
being
intimate
with
erminia
that
you
wo
do
a
thing
i
tell
you
you
are
as
selfish
and
as
he
made
a
pause
maggie
was
ready
to
cry
i
will
do
anything
ned
that
is
right
well
and
i
tell
you
this
is
right
how
can
it
be
said
she
sadly
almost
wishing
to
be
convinced
how
why
it
is
and
that
enough
for
you
you
must
always
have
a
reason
for
everything
now
you
are
not
half
so
nice
as
you
were
unless
one
chops
logic
with
you
and
convinces
you
by
a
long
argument
you
do
nothing
be
obedient
i
tell
you
that
is
what
a
woman
has
to
be
i
could
be
obedient
to
some
people
without
knowing
their
reasons
even
though
they
told
me
to
do
silly
things
said
maggie
half
to
herself
i
should
like
to
know
to
whom
said
edward
scornfully
to
don
quixote
answered
she
seriously
for
indeed
he
was
present
in
her
mind
just
then
and
his
noble
tender
melancholy
character
had
made
a
strong
impression
there
edward
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
burst
into
a
loud
fit
of
laughter
it
had
the
good
effect
of
restoring
him
to
a
better
frame
of
mind
he
had
such
an
excellent
joke
against
his
sister
that
he
could
not
be
angry
with
her
he
called
her
sancho
panza
all
the
rest
of
the
holidays
though
she
protested
against
it
saying
she
could
not
bear
the
squire
and
disliked
being
called
by
his
name
frank
and
edward
seemed
to
have
a
mutual
antipathy
to
each
other
and
the
coldness
between
them
was
rather
increased
than
diminished
by
all
buxton
efforts
to
bring
them
together
come
frank
my
lad
said
he
do
be
so
stiff
with
ned
his
father
was
a
dear
friend
of
mine
and
set
my
heart
on
seeing
you
friends
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
help
him
on
in
the
world
but
frank
answered
he
is
not
quite
honorable
sir
i
ca
bear
a
boy
who
is
not
quite
honorable
boys
brought
up
at
those
private
schools
are
so
full
of
tricks
nay
my
lad
there
wrong
i
was
brought
up
at
a
private
school
and
no
one
can
say
i
ever
dirtied
my
hands
with
a
trick
in
my
life
good
old
thompson
would
have
flogged
the
life
out
of
a
boy
who
did
anything
mean
or
underhand
chapter
iv
summers
and
winters
came
and
went
with
little
to
mark
them
except
the
growth
of
the
trees
and
the
quiet
progress
of
young
creatures
erminia
was
sent
to
school
somewhere
in
france
to
receive
more
regular
instruction
than
she
could
have
in
the
house
with
her
invalid
aunt
but
she
came
home
once
a
year
more
lovely
and
elegant
and
dainty
than
ever
and
maggie
thought
with
truth
that
ripening
years
were
softening
down
her
volatility
and
that
her
aunt
dewlike
sayings
had
quietly
sunk
deep
and
fertilized
the
soil
that
aunt
was
fading
away
maggie
devotion
added
materially
to
her
happiness
and
both
she
and
maggie
never
forgot
that
this
devotion
was
to
be
in
all
things
subservient
to
the
duty
which
she
owed
to
her
mother
my
love
buxton
had
more
than
once
said
you
must
always
recollect
that
your
first
duty
is
toward
your
mother
you
know
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
but
i
shall
always
understand
how
it
is
if
you
do
not
come
she
may
often
want
you
when
neither
you
nor
i
can
anticipate
it
browne
had
no
great
wish
to
keep
maggie
at
home
though
she
liked
to
grumble
at
her
going
still
she
felt
that
it
was
best
in
every
way
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
such
valuable
friends
and
she
appreciated
in
some
small
degree
the
advantage
which
her
intimacy
at
the
house
was
to
maggie
but
yet
she
could
not
restrain
a
few
complaints
nor
withhold
from
her
on
her
return
a
recapitulation
of
all
the
things
which
might
have
been
done
if
she
had
only
been
at
home
and
the
number
of
times
that
she
had
been
wanted
but
when
she
found
that
maggie
quietly
gave
up
her
next
visit
as
soon
as
she
was
made
aware
of
any
necessity
for
her
presence
at
home
her
mother
left
off
grumbling
and
took
little
or
no
notice
of
her
absence
when
the
time
came
for
edward
to
leave
school
he
announced
that
he
had
no
intention
of
taking
orders
but
meant
to
become
an
attorney
it
such
slow
work
said
he
to
his
mother
one
toils
away
for
four
or
five
years
and
then
one
gets
a
curacy
of
seventy
pounds
and
no
end
of
work
to
do
for
the
money
now
the
work
is
not
much
harder
in
a
office
and
if
one
has
one
wits
about
one
there
are
hundreds
and
thousands
to
be
picked
up
with
mighty
little
trouble
browne
was
very
sorry
for
this
determination
she
had
a
great
desire
to
see
her
son
a
clergyman
like
his
father
she
did
not
consider
whether
his
character
was
fitted
for
so
sacred
an
office
she
rather
thought
that
the
profession
itself
when
once
assumed
would
purify
the
character
but
in
fact
his
fitness
or
unfitness
for
holy
orders
entered
little
into
her
mind
she
had
a
respect
for
the
profession
and
his
father
had
belonged
to
it
i
had
rather
see
you
a
curate
at
seventy
pounds
than
an
attorney
with
seven
hundred
replied
she
and
you
know
your
father
was
always
asked
to
dine
everywhere
to
places
where
i
know
they
would
not
have
asked
bish
of
woodchester
and
he
makes
his
thousand
besides
buxton
has
the
next
presentation
to
combehurst
and
you
would
stand
a
good
chance
for
your
father
sake
and
in
the
mean
time
you
should
live
here
if
your
curacy
was
any
way
near
i
dare
say
catch
me
burying
myself
here
again
my
dear
mother
it
a
very
respectable
place
for
you
and
maggie
to
live
in
and
i
dare
say
you
do
find
it
dull
but
the
idea
of
my
quietly
sitting
down
here
is
something
too
absurd
papa
did
and
was
very
happy
said
maggie
yes
after
he
had
been
at
oxford
replied
edward
a
little
nonplussed
by
this
reference
to
one
whose
memory
even
the
most
selfish
and
thoughtless
must
have
held
in
respect
well
and
you
know
you
would
have
to
go
to
oxford
first
maggie
i
wish
you
would
not
interfere
between
my
mother
and
me
i
want
to
have
it
settled
and
done
with
and
that
it
will
never
be
if
you
keep
meddling
now
mother
do
you
see
how
much
better
it
will
be
for
me
to
go
into
bish
office
harry
bish
has
spoken
to
his
father
about
it
browne
sighed
what
will
buxton
say
asked
she
dolefully
say
why
do
you
see
it
was
he
who
first
put
it
into
my
head
by
telling
me
that
first
christmas
holidays
that
i
should
be
his
agent
that
would
be
something
would
it
not
harry
bish
says
he
thinks
a
thousand
might
ha
made
of
it
his
loud
decided
rapid
talking
overpowered
browne
but
she
resigned
herself
to
his
wishes
with
more
regrets
than
she
had
ever
done
before
it
was
not
the
first
case
in
which
fluent
declamation
has
taken
the
place
of
argument
edward
was
articled
to
bish
and
thus
gained
his
point
there
was
no
one
with
power
to
resist
his
wishes
except
his
mother
and
buxton
the
former
had
long
acknowledged
her
son
will
as
her
law
and
the
latter
though
surprised
and
almost
disappointed
at
a
change
of
purpose
which
he
had
never
anticipated
in
his
plans
for
edward
benefit
gave
his
consent
and
even
advanced
some
of
the
money
requisite
for
the
premium
maggie
looked
upon
this
change
with
mingled
feelings
she
had
always
from
a
child
pictured
edward
to
herself
as
taking
her
father
place
when
she
had
thought
of
him
as
a
man
it
was
as
contemplative
grave
and
gentle
as
she
remembered
her
father
with
all
a
child
deficiency
of
reasoning
power
she
had
never
considered
how
impossible
it
was
that
a
selfish
vain
and
impatient
boy
could
become
a
meek
humble
and
pious
man
merely
by
adopting
a
profession
in
which
such
qualities
are
required
but
now
at
sixteen
she
was
beginning
to
understand
all
this
not
by
any
process
of
thought
but
by
something
more
like
a
correct
feeling
she
perceived
that
edward
would
never
be
the
true
minister
of
christ
so
more
glad
and
thankful
than
sorry
though
sorrow
mingled
with
her
sentiments
she
learned
the
decision
that
he
was
to
be
an
attorney
frank
buxton
all
this
time
was
growing
up
into
a
young
man
the
hopes
both
of
father
and
mother
were
bound
up
in
him
and
according
to
the
difference
in
their
characters
was
the
difference
in
their
hopes
it
seemed
indeed
probable
that
buxton
who
was
singularly
void
of
worldliness
or
ambition
for
himself
would
become
worldly
and
ambitious
for
his
son
his
hopes
for
frank
were
all
for
honor
and
distinction
here
hopes
were
prayers
she
was
fading
away
as
light
fades
into
darkness
on
a
summer
evening
no
one
seemed
to
remark
the
gradual
progress
but
she
was
fully
conscious
of
it
herself
the
last
time
that
frank
was
at
home
from
college
before
her
death
she
knew
that
she
should
never
see
him
again
and
when
he
gaily
left
the
house
with
a
cheerfulness
which
was
partly
assumed
she
dragged
herself
with
languid
steps
into
a
room
at
the
front
of
the
house
from
which
she
could
watch
him
down
the
long
straggling
little
street
that
led
to
the
inn
from
which
the
coach
started
as
he
went
along
he
turned
to
look
back
at
his
home
and
there
he
saw
his
mother
white
figure
gazing
after
him
he
could
not
see
her
wistful
eyes
but
he
made
her
poor
heart
give
a
leap
of
joy
by
turning
round
and
running
back
for
one
more
kiss
and
one
more
blessing
when
he
next
came
home
it
was
at
the
sudden
summons
of
her
death
his
father
was
as
one
distracted
he
could
not
speak
of
the
lost
angel
without
sudden
bursts
of
tears
and
oftentimes
of
which
disturbed
the
calm
still
holy
ideas
which
frank
liked
to
associate
with
her
he
ceased
speaking
to
him
therefore
about
their
mutual
loss
and
it
was
a
certain
kind
of
relief
to
both
when
he
did
so
but
he
longed
for
some
one
to
whom
he
might
talk
of
his
mother
with
the
quiet
reverence
of
intense
and
trustful
affection
he
thought
of
maggie
of
whom
he
had
seen
but
little
of
late
for
when
he
had
been
at
combehurst
she
had
felt
that
buxton
required
her
presence
less
and
had
remained
more
at
home
possibly
buxton
regretted
this
but
she
never
said
anything
she
as
one
who
was
near
death
foresaw
that
probably
if
maggie
and
her
son
met
often
in
her
feelings
might
arise
which
would
militate
against
her
husband
hopes
and
plans
and
which
therefore
she
ought
not
to
allow
to
spring
up
but
she
had
been
unable
to
refrain
from
expressing
her
gratitude
to
maggie
for
many
hours
of
tranquil
happiness
and
had
unconsciously
dropped
many
sentences
which
made
frank
feel
that
in
the
little
brown
mouse
of
former
years
he
was
likely
to
meet
with
one
who
could
tell
him
much
of
the
inner
history
of
his
mother
in
her
last
days
and
to
whom
he
could
speak
of
her
without
calling
out
the
passionate
sorrow
which
was
so
little
in
unison
with
her
memory
accordingly
one
afternoon
late
in
the
autumn
he
rode
up
to
browne
the
air
on
the
heights
was
so
still
that
nothing
seemed
to
stir
now
and
then
a
yellow
leaf
came
floating
down
from
the
trees
detached
from
no
outward
violence
but
only
because
its
life
had
reached
its
full
limit
and
then
ceased
looking
down
on
the
distant
sheltered
woods
they
were
gorgeous
in
orange
and
crimson
but
their
splendor
was
felt
to
be
the
sign
of
the
decaying
and
dying
year
even
without
an
inward
sorrow
there
was
a
grand
solemnity
in
the
season
which
impressed
the
mind
and
hushed
it
into
tranquil
thought
frank
rode
slowly
along
and
quietly
dismounted
at
the
old
beside
which
there
was
an
iron
fixed
in
the
gray
stone
wall
he
saw
the
casement
of
the
open
and
maggie
head
bent
down
over
her
work
she
looked
up
as
he
entered
the
court
and
his
footsteps
sounded
on
the
she
came
round
and
opened
the
door
as
she
stood
in
the
speaking
he
was
struck
by
her
resemblance
to
some
old
painting
he
had
seen
her
young
calm
face
shining
out
with
great
peacefulness
and
the
large
grave
thoughtful
eyes
giving
the
character
to
the
features
which
otherwise
they
might
from
their
very
regularity
have
wanted
her
brown
dress
had
the
exact
tint
which
a
painter
would
have
admired
the
slanting
mellow
sunlight
fell
upon
her
as
she
stood
and
the
already
made
a
rich
warm
border
as
they
hung
over
the
old
mamma
is
not
well
she
is
gone
to
lie
down
how
are
you
how
is
mr
buxton
we
are
both
pretty
well
quite
well
in
fact
as
far
as
regards
health
may
i
come
in
i
want
to
talk
to
you
maggie
she
opened
the
little
and
they
went
in
but
for
a
time
they
were
both
silent
they
could
not
speak
of
her
who
was
with
them
present
in
their
thoughts
maggie
shut
the
casement
and
put
a
log
of
wood
on
the
fire
she
sat
down
with
her
back
to
the
window
but
as
the
flame
sprang
up
and
blazed
at
the
touch
of
the
dry
wood
frank
saw
that
her
face
was
wet
with
quiet
tears
still
her
voice
was
even
and
gentle
as
she
answered
his
questions
she
seemed
to
understand
what
were
the
very
things
he
would
care
most
to
hear
she
spoke
of
his
mother
last
days
and
without
any
word
of
praise
which
indeed
would
have
been
impertinence
she
showed
such
a
just
and
true
appreciation
of
her
who
was
dead
and
gone
that
he
felt
as
if
he
could
listen
forever
to
the
words
they
were
balm
to
his
sore
heart
he
had
thought
it
possible
that
the
suddenness
of
her
death
might
have
made
her
life
incomplete
in
that
she
might
have
departed
without
being
able
to
express
wishes
and
projects
which
would
now
have
the
sacred
force
of
commands
but
he
found
that
maggie
though
she
had
never
intruded
herself
as
such
had
been
the
depository
of
many
little
thoughts
and
plans
or
if
they
were
not
expressed
to
her
she
knew
that
buxton
or
dawson
was
aware
of
what
they
were
though
in
their
violence
of
early
grief
they
had
forgotten
to
name
them
the
flickering
brightness
of
the
flame
had
died
away
the
gloom
of
evening
had
gathered
into
the
room
through
the
open
door
of
which
the
kitchen
fire
sent
a
ruddy
glow
distinctly
marked
against
carpet
and
wall
frank
still
sat
with
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
against
the
table
listening
tell
me
more
he
said
at
every
pause
i
think
i
have
told
you
all
now
said
maggie
at
last
at
least
it
is
all
i
recollect
at
present
but
if
i
think
of
anything
more
i
will
be
sure
and
tell
you
thank
you
do
he
was
silent
for
some
time
erminia

coming
home

christmas

is
not
to
go
back
to
paris
again

will
live

you
she
has
been
very
sorry
for
you
all
added
she
dropping
her
voice
before
he
could
answer
she
ran
up
stairs
browne
came
down
oh
frank
have
you
been
sitting
in
the
dark
maggie
you
ought
to
have
rung
for
candles
ah
frank
you
had
a
sad
loss
since
i
saw
you
here
let
me
see
in
the
last
week
of
september
but
she
was
always
a
sad
invalid
and
no
doubt
your
loss
is
her
gain
poor
buxton
too
how
is
he
when
one
thinks
of
him
and
of
her
years
of
illness
it
seems
like
a
happy
release
she
could
have
gone
on
for
any
length
of
time
but
frank
could
not
bear
this
ruffling
up
of
his
soothed
grief
and
told
her
that
his
father
was
expecting
him
home
to
dinner
ah
i
am
sure
you
must
not
disappoint
him
he
want
a
little
cheerful
company
more
than
ever
now
you
must
not
let
him
dwell
on
it
frank
but
turn
his
thoughts
another
way
by
always
talking
of
other
things
i
am
sure
if
i
had
some
one
to
speak
to
me
in
a
cheerful
pleasant
way
when
poor
dear
browne
died
i
should
never
have
fretted
after
him
as
i
did
but
the
children
were
too
young
and
there
was
no
one
to
come
and
divert
me
with
any
news
if
i
been
living
in
combehurst
i
am
sure
i
should
not
have
let
my
grief
get
the
better
of
me
as
i
did
could
you
get
up
a
quiet
rubber
in
the
evenings
do
you
think
but
frank
had
shaken
hands
and
was
gone
as
he
rode
home
he
thought
much
of
sorrow
and
the
different
ways
of
bearing
it
he
decided
that
it
was
sent
by
god
for
some
holy
purpose
and
to
call
out
into
existence
some
higher
good
and
he
thought
that
if
it
were
faithfully
taken
as
his
decree
there
would
be
no
passionate
despairing
resistance
to
it
nor
yet
if
it
were
trustfully
acknowledged
to
have
some
wise
end
should
we
dare
to
baulk
it
and
defraud
it
by
putting
it
on
one
side
and
by
seeking
the
distractions
of
worldly
things
not
let
it
do
its
full
work
and
then
he
returned
to
his
conversation
with
maggie
that
had
been
real
comfort
to
him
what
an
advantage
it
would
be
to
erminia
to
have
such
a
girl
for
a
friend
and
companion
it
was
rather
strange
that
having
this
thought
and
having
been
struck
as
i
said
with
maggie
appearance
while
she
stood
in
the
and
i
may
add
that
this
impression
of
her
unobtrusive
beauty
had
been
deepened
by
several
succeeding
interviews
he
should
reply
as
he
did
to
remark
on
first
seeing
maggie
after
her
return
from
france
how
lovely
maggie
is
growing
why
i
had
no
idea
she
would
ever
turn
out
pretty
she
always
was
but
now
her
style
of
beauty
makes
her
positively
distinguished
frank
speak
is
not
she
beautiful
do
you
think
so
answered
he
with
a
kind
of
lazy
indifference
exceedingly
gratifying
to
his
father
who
was
listening
with
some
eagerness
to
his
answer
that
day
after
dinner
buxton
began
to
ask
his
opinion
of
erminia
appearance
frank
answered
at
once
she
is
a
dazzling
little
creature
her
complexion
looks
as
if
it
were
made
of
cherries
and
milk
and
it
must
be
owned
the
little
lady
has
studied
the
art
of
dress
to
some
purpose
in
paris
buxton
was
nearer
happiness
at
this
reply
than
he
had
ever
been
since
his
wife
death
for
the
only
way
he
could
devise
to
satisfy
his
reproachful
conscience
towards
his
neglected
and
unhappy
sister
was
to
plan
a
marriage
between
his
son
and
her
child
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
drank
two
extra
glasses
of
wine
we
have
the
brownes
to
dinner
as
usual
next
thursday
said
he
i
am
sure
your
mother
would
have
been
hurt
if
we
had
omitted
it
it
is
now
nine
years
since
they
began
to
come
and
they
have
never
missed
one
christmas
since
do
you
see
any
objection
frank
none
at
all
sir
answered
he
i
intend
to
go
up
to
town
soon
after
christmas
for
a
week
or
ten
days
on
my
way
to
cambridge
can
i
do
anything
for
you
well
i
do
know
i
think
i
shall
go
up
myself
some
day
soon
i
understand
all
these
lawyer
letters
about
the
purchase
of
the
newbridge
estate
and
i
fancy
i
could
make
more
sense
out
of
it
all
if
i
saw
mr
hodgson
i
wish
you
would
adopt
my
plan
of
having
an
agent
sir
your
affairs
are
really
so
complicated
now
that
they
would
take
up
the
time
of
an
expert
man
of
business
i
am
sure
all
those
tenants
at
dumford
ought
to
be
seen
after
i
do
see
after
them
there
never
a
one
that
dares
cheat
me
or
that
would
cheat
me
if
they
could
most
of
them
have
lived
under
the
buxtons
for
generations
they
know
that
if
they
dared
to
take
advantage
of
me
i
should
come
down
upon
them
pretty
smartly
do
you
rely
upon
their
attachment
to
your
family
or
on
their
idea
of
your
severity
on
both
they
stand
me
instead
of
much
trouble
in
and
those
eternal
lawyers
letters
some
people
are
always
dispatching
to
their
tenants
when
i
cheated
frank
i
give
you
leave
to
make
me
have
an
agent
but
not
till
then
there
my
little
erminia
singing
away
and
nobody
to
hear
her
chapter
was
strange
and
sad
buxton
had
always
contrived
to
be
in
the
ready
to
receive
them
all
after
dinner
buxton
tried
to
do
away
with
his
thoughts
of
her
by
much
talking
but
every
now
and
then
he
looked
wistfully
toward
the
door
erminia
exerted
herself
to
be
as
lively
as
she
could
in
order
if
possible
to
fill
up
the
vacuum
edward
who
had
come
over
from
woodchester
for
a
walk
had
a
good
deal
to
say
and
was
unconsciously
a
great
assistance
with
his
flow
of
rather
clever
his
mother
felt
proud
of
her
son
and
his
new
waistcoat
which
was
far
more
conspicuously
of
the
latest
fashion
than
frank
could
be
said
to
be
after
dinner
when
buxton
and
the
two
young
men
were
left
alone
edward
launched
out
still
more
he
thought
he
was
impressing
frank
with
his
knowledge
of
the
world
and
the
world
ways
but
he
was
doing
all
in
his
power
to
repel
one
who
had
never
been
much
attracted
toward
him
worldly
success
was
his
standard
of
merit
the
end
seemed
with
him
to
justify
the
means
if
a
man
prospered
if
was
not
necessary
to
scrutinize
his
conduct
too
closely
the
law
was
viewed
in
its
lowest
aspect
and
yet
with
a
certain
cleverness
which
preserved
edward
from
being
intellectually
contemptible
frank
had
entertained
some
idea
of
studying
for
a
barrister
himself
not
so
much
as
a
means
of
livelihood
as
to
gain
some
idea
of
the
code
which
makes
and
shows
a
nation
conscience
but
edward
details
of
the
ways
in
which
the
letter
so
often
baffles
the
spirit
made
him
recoil
with
some
anger
against
himself
for
viewing
the
profession
with
disgust
because
it
was
degraded
by
those
who
embraced
it
instead
of
looking
upon
it
as
what
might
be
ennobled
and
purified
into
a
vast
intelligence
by
high
and
men
he
got
up
abruptly
and
left
the
room
the
girls
were
sitting
over
the
fire
with
unlighted
candles
on
the
table
talking
he
felt
about
his
mother
but
when
he
came
in
they
rose
and
changed
their
tone
erminia
went
to
the
piano
and
sang
her
newest
and
choicest
french
airs
frank
was
gloomy
and
silent
but
when
she
changed
into
more
solemn
music
his
mood
was
softened
maggie
simple
and
hearty
admiration
untinged
by
the
slightest
shade
of
envy
for
accomplishments
charmed
him
the
one
appeared
to
him
the
perfection
of
elegant
art
the
other
of
graceful
nature
when
he
looked
at
maggie
and
thought
of
the
moorland
home
from
which
she
had
never
wandered
the
mysteriously
beautiful
lines
of
wordsworth
seemed
to
become
to
him
and
she
shall
lean
her
ear
in
many
a
secret
place
where
rivulets
dance
their
wayward
round
and
beauty
born
of
murmuring
sound
shall
pass
into
her
face
buxton
in
the
was
really
getting
to
take
an
interest
in
edward
puzzling
cases
they
were
like
tricks
at
cards
a
quick
motion
and
out
of
the
unpromising
heap
all
confused
together
presto
the
right
card
turned
up
edward
stated
his
case
so
that
there
did
not
seem
loophole
for
the
desired
verdict
but
through
some
conjuration
it
always
came
uppermost
at
last
he
had
a
graphic
way
of
relating
things
and
as
he
did
not
spare
epithets
in
his
designation
of
the
opposing
party
buxton
took
it
upon
trust
that
the
defendant
or
the
prosecutor
as
it
might
happen
was
a
pettifogging
knave
or
a
miserly
curmudgeon
and
rejoiced
accordingly
in
the
triumph
over
him
gained
by
the
ready
wit
of
our
governor
bish
at
last
he
became
so
deeply
impressed
with
knowledge
of
law
as
to
consult
him
about
some
cottage
property
he
had
in
woodchester
i
rather
think
there
are
cottages
and
they
do
bring
me
in
four
pounds
and
out
of
that
i
have
to
pay
for
collecting
would
there
be
any
chance
of
selling
them
they
are
in
a
bad
neighborhood
i
fear
very
bad
was
edward
prompt
reply
but
if
you
are
really
anxious
to
effect
a
sale
i
have
no
doubt
i
could
find
a
purchaser
in
a
short
time
i
should
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
said
buxton
you
would
be
doing
me
a
kindness
if
you
meet
with
a
purchaser
and
can
manage
the
affair
i
would
rather
that
you
drew
out
the
deeds
for
the
transfer
of
the
property
if
would
be
the
beginning
of
business
for
you
and
i
only
hope
i
should
bring
you
good
luck
of
course
edward
could
do
this
and
when
they
left
the
table
it
was
with
a
feeling
on
his
side
that
he
was
a
step
nearer
to
the
agency
which
he
coveted
and
with
a
happy
consciousness
on
buxton
of
having
put
a
few
pounds
in
the
way
of
a
deserving
and
remarkably
clever
young
man
since
edward
had
left
home
maggie
had
gradually
but
surely
been
gaining
in
importance
her
judgment
and
her
untiring
unselfishness
could
not
fail
to
make
way
her
mother
had
some
respect
for
and
great
dependence
on
her
but
still
it
was
hardly
affection
that
she
felt
for
her
or
if
it
was
it
was
a
dull
and
torpid
kind
of
feeling
compared
with
the
fond
love
and
exulting
pride
which
she
took
in
edward
when
he
came
back
for
occasional
holidays
his
mother
face
was
radiant
with
happiness
and
her
manner
toward
him
was
even
more
caressing
than
he
approved
of
when
maggie
saw
him
repel
the
hand
that
fain
would
have
stroked
his
hair
as
in
childish
days
a
longing
came
into
her
heart
for
some
of
these
tokens
of
her
mother
love
otherwise
she
meekly
sank
back
into
her
old
secondary
place
content
to
have
her
judgment
slighted
and
her
wishes
unasked
as
long
as
he
stayed
at
times
she
was
now
beginning
to
disapprove
and
regret
some
things
in
him
his
flashiness
of
manner
jarred
against
her
taste
and
a
deeper
graver
feeling
was
called
out
by
his
evident
want
of
quick
moral
perception
smart
and
clever
or
slow
and
dull
took
with
him
the
place
of
right
and
wrong
little
as
he
thought
it
he
was
himself
and
dull
slow
and
blind
to
perceive
the
beauty
and
eternal
wisdom
of
simple
goodness
erminia
and
maggie
became
great
friends
erminia
used
to
beg
for
maggie
until
she
herself
put
a
stop
to
the
practice
as
she
saw
her
mother
yielded
more
frequently
than
was
convenient
for
the
honor
of
having
her
daughter
a
visitor
at
buxton
about
which
she
could
talk
to
her
few
acquaintances
who
persevered
in
calling
at
the
cottage
then
erminia
volunteered
a
visit
of
some
days
to
maggie
and
browne
pride
was
redoubled
but
she
made
so
many
preparations
and
so
much
fuss
and
gave
herself
so
much
trouble
that
she
was
positively
ill
during
erminia
stay
and
maggie
felt
that
she
must
henceforward
deny
herself
the
pleasure
of
having
her
friend
for
a
guest
as
her
mother
could
not
be
persuaded
from
attempting
to
provide
things
in
the
same
abundance
and
style
as
that
to
which
erminia
was
accustomed
at
home
whereas
as
nancy
shrewdly
observed
the
young
lady
did
not
know
if
she
was
eating
jelly
or
porridge
or
whether
the
plates
were
common
delf
or
the
best
china
so
long
as
she
was
with
her
dear
miss
maggie
spring
went
and
summer
came
frank
had
gone
to
and
fro
between
cambridge
and
combehurst
drawn
by
motives
of
which
he
felt
the
force
but
into
which
he
did
not
care
to
examine
edward
had
sold
the
property
of
buxton
and
he
pleased
with
the
possession
of
half
the
purchase
money
the
remainder
of
which
was
to
be
paid
by
installments
and
happy
in
the
idea
that
his
son
came
over
so
frequently
to
see
erminia
had
amply
rewarded
the
young
attorney
for
his
services
one
summer
day
as
hot
as
day
could
be
maggie
had
been
busy
all
morning
for
the
weather
was
so
sultry
that
she
would
not
allow
either
nancy
or
her
mother
to
exert
themselves
much
she
had
gone
down
with
the
old
brown
pitcher
coeval
with
herself
to
the
spring
for
water
and
while
it
was
trickling
and
making
a
tinkling
music
she
sat
down
on
the
ground
the
air
was
so
still
that
she
heard
the
distant
cooing
and
round
about
her
the
bees
were
murmuring
busily
among
the
clustering
heath
from
some
little
touch
of
sympathy
with
these
low
sounds
of
pleasant
harmony
she
began
to
try
and
hum
some
of
erminia
airs
she
never
sang
out
loud
or
put
words
to
her
songs
but
her
voice
was
very
sweet
and
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
herself
to
let
it
go
into
music
just
as
her
jug
was
filled
she
was
startled
by
frank
sudden
appearance
she
thought
he
was
at
cambridge
and
from
some
cause
or
other
her
face
usually
so
faint
in
color
became
the
most
vivid
scarlet
they
were
both
too
conscious
to
speak
maggie
stooped
murmuring
some
words
of
surprise
to
take
up
her
pitcher
do
go
yet
maggie
said
he
putting
his
hand
on
hers
to
stop
her
but
somehow
when
that
purpose
was
effected
he
forgot
to
take
it
off
again
i
have
come
all
the
way
from
cambridge
to
see
you
i
could
not
bear
suspense
any
longer
i
grew
so
impatient
for
certainty
of
some
kind
that
i
went
up
to
town
last
night
in
order
to
feel
myself
on
my
way
to
you
even
though
i
knew
i
could
not
be
here
a
bit
earlier
for
doing
so
maggie
dear
maggie
how
you
are
trembling
have
i
frightened
you
nancy
told
me
you
were
here
but
it
was
very
thoughtless
to
come
so
suddenly
upon
you
it
was
not
the
suddenness
of
his
coming
it
was
the
suddenness
of
her
own
heart
which
leaped
up
with
the
feelings
called
out
by
his
words
she
went
very
white
and
sat
down
on
the
ground
as
before
but
she
rose
again
immediately
and
stood
with
drooping
averted
head
he
had
dropped
her
hand
but
now
sought
to
take
it
again
maggie
darling
may
i
speak
her
lips
moved
he
saw
but
he
could
not
hear
a
pang
of
affright
ran
through
him
that
perhaps
she
did
not
wish
to
listen
may
i
speak
to
you
he
asked
again
quite
timidly
she
tried
to
make
her
voice
sound
but
it
would
not
so
she
looked
round
her
soft
gray
eyes
were
eloquent
in
that
one
glance
and
happier
than
his
words
passionate
and
tender
as
they
were
could
tell
he
spoke
till
her
trembling
was
changed
into
bright
flashing
blushes
and
even
a
shy
smile
hovered
about
her
lips
and
dimpled
her
cheeks
the
water
bubbled
over
the
pitcher
unheeded
at
last
she
remembered
all
the
world
she
lifted
up
the
jug
and
would
have
hurried
home
but
frank
decidedly
took
it
from
her
henceforward
said
he
i
have
a
right
to
carry
your
burdens
so
with
one
arm
round
her
waist
and
with
the
other
carrying
the
water
they
climbed
the
steep
turfy
slope
near
the
top
she
wanted
to
take
it
again
mamma
will
not
like
it
mamma
will
think
if
so
strange
why
dearest
if
i
saw
nancy
carrying
it
up
this
slope
i
would
take
it
from
her
it
would
be
strange
if
a
man
did
not
carry
it
for
any
woman
but
you
must
let
me
tell
your
mother
of
my
right
to
help
you
if
is
your
is
it
not
i
may
come
in
to
dinner
as
one
of
the
family
may
not
i
maggie
no
she
said
softly
for
she
longed
to
be
alone
and
she
dreaded
being
overwhelmed
by
the
expression
of
her
mother
feelings
weak
and
agitated
as
she
felt
herself
not
not
said
he
reproachfully
you
are
very
hard
upon
me
let
me
come
to
tea
if
you
will
i
will
leave
you
now
let
me
come
to
early
tea
i
must
speak
to
my
father
he
does
not
know
i
am
here
i
may
come
to
tea
at
what
time
is
it
three
oh
i
know
you
drink
tea
at
some
strange
early
hour
perhaps
it
is
at
two
i
will
take
care
to
be
in
time
do
come
till
five
please
i
must
tell
mamma
and
i
want
some
time
to
think
it
does
seem
so
like
a
dream
do
go
please
well
if
i
must
i
must
but
i
do
feel
as
if
i
were
in
a
dream
but
in
some
real
blessed
heaven
so
long
as
i
see
you
at
last
he
went
nancy
was
awaiting
maggie
the
bless
us
and
save
us
bairn
what
a
time
it
has
taken
thee
to
get
the
water
is
the
spring
dry
with
the
hot
weather
maggie
ran
past
her
all
she
heard
her
mother
voice
in
lamentation
about
something
she
answered
at
random
and
startled
her
mother
by
asserting
that
she
thought
it
was
very
good
the
said
it
being
milk
turned
sour
by
thunder
browne
spoke
quite
sharply
no
one
is
so
particular
as
you
maggie
i
have
known
you
drink
water
day
after
day
for
breakfast
when
you
were
a
little
girl
because
your
cup
of
milk
had
a
drowned
fly
in
it
and
now
you
tell
me
you
care
for
this
and
do
mind
that
just
as
if
you
could
eat
up
all
the
things
which
are
spoiled
by
the
heat
i
declare
my
head
aches
so
i
shall
go
and
lie
down
as
soon
as
ever
dinner
is
over
if
this
was
her
plan
maggie
thought
she
had
no
time
to
lose
in
making
her
confession
frank
would
be
here
before
her
mother
got
up
again
to
tea
but
she
dreaded
speaking
about
her
happiness
it
seemed
as
yet
so
as
if
a
touch
would
spoil
its
beauty
mamma
just
wait
a
minute
just
sit
down
in
your
chair
while
i
tell
you
something
please
dear
mamma
she
took
a
stool
and
sat
at
her
feet
and
then
she
began
to
turn
the
on
browne
hand
looking
down
and
never
speaking
till
the
latter
became
impatient
what
is
if
you
have
got
to
say
child
do
make
haste
for
i
want
to
go
with
a
great
jerk
of
resolution
maggie
said
mamma
frank
buxton
has
asked
me
to
marry
him
she
hid
her
face
in
her
mother
lap
for
an
instant
and
then
she
lifted
it
up
as
brimful
of
the
light
of
happiness
as
is
the
cup
of
a
of
the
sun
radiance
maggie
you
do
say
so
said
her
mother
half
incredulously
it
be
for
he
at
cambridge
and
it
not
what
do
you
mean
he
came
this
morning
mother
when
i
was
down
at
the
well
and
we
fixed
that
i
was
to
speak
to
you
and
he
asked
if
he
might
come
again
for
tea
dear
dear
and
the
milk
all
gone
sour
we
should
have
had
milk
of
our
own
if
edward
had
not
persuaded
me
against
buying
another
cow
i
do
think
buxton
will
mind
it
much
said
maggie
dimpling
up
as
she
remembered
half
unconsciously
how
little
he
had
seemed
to
care
for
anything
but
herself
why
what
a
thing
it
is
for
you
said
browne
quite
roused
up
from
her
languor
and
her
everybody
said
he
was
engaged
to
miss
erminia
are
you
quite
sure
you
made
no
mistake
child
what
did
he
say
young
men
are
so
fond
of
making
fine
speeches
and
young
women
are
so
silly
in
fancying
they
mean
something
i
once
knew
a
girl
who
thought
that
a
gentleman
who
sent
her
mother
a
present
of
a
did
it
as
a
delicate
way
of
making
her
an
offer
tell
me
his
exact
words
but
maggie
blushed
and
either
would
not
or
could
not
so
browne
began
again
well
if
you
sure
you
sure
i
wonder
how
he
brought
his
father
round
so
long
as
he
and
erminia
have
been
planned
for
each
other
that
very
first
day
we
ever
dined
there
after
your
father
death
buxton
as
good
as
told
me
all
about
it
i
fancied
they
were
only
waiting
till
they
were
out
of
mourning
all
this
was
news
to
maggie
she
had
never
thought
that
either
erminia
or
frank
was
particularly
fond
of
the
other
still
less
had
she
had
any
idea
of
buxton
plans
for
them
her
mother
surprise
at
her
engagement
jarred
a
little
upon
her
too
it
had
become
so
natural
even
in
these
last
two
hours
to
feel
that
she
belonged
to
but
there
were
more
discords
to
come
browne
began
again
half
in
soliloquy
i
should
think
he
would
have
four
thousand
he
did
not
tell
you
love
did
he
if
they
had
still
that
bad
property
in
the
canal
that
his
father
complained
about
but
he
will
have
four
thousand
why
you
have
your
carriage
maggie
well
i
hope
buxton
has
taken
it
kindly
because
he
have
a
deal
to
do
with
the
settlements
i
sure
i
thought
he
was
engaged
to
erminia
ringing
changes
on
these
subjects
all
the
afternoon
browne
sat
with
maggie
she
occasionally
wandered
off
to
speak
about
edward
and
how
favorably
his
future
prospects
would
be
advanced
by
the
engagement
let
me
see
there
the
house
in
combehurst
the
rent
of
that
would
be
a
hundred
and
fifty
but
we
not
reckon
that
but
there
the
quarries
she
was
reckoning
upon
her
fingers
in
default
of
a
slate
for
which
she
had
vainly
searched
we
call
them
two
hundred
for
i
do
believe
buxton
stories
about
their
only
bringing
him
in
and
there
newbridge
that
certainly
thirteen
hundred
where
had
i
got
to
maggie
dear
mamma
do
go
and
lie
down
for
a
little
you
look
quite
flushed
said
maggie
softly
was
this
the
manner
to
view
her
betrothal
with
such
a
man
as
frank
her
mother
remarks
depressed
her
more
than
she
could
have
thought
it
possible
the
excitement
of
the
morning
was
having
its
reaction
and
she
longed
to
go
up
to
the
solitude
under
the
where
she
had
hoped
to
spend
a
quiet
thoughtful
afternoon
nancy
came
in
to
replace
glasses
and
spoons
in
the
cupboard
by
some
accident
the
careful
old
servant
broke
one
of
the
former
she
looked
up
quickly
at
her
mistress
who
usually
visited
all
such
offences
with
no
small
portion
of
rebuke
never
mind
nancy
said
browne
it
only
an
old
tumbler
and
maggie
going
to
be
married
and
we
must
buy
a
new
set
for
the
nancy
looked
at
both
bewildered
at
last
a
light
dawned
into
her
mind
and
her
face
looked
shrewdly
and
knowingly
back
at
browne
then
she
said
very
quietly
i
think
i
take
the
next
pitcher
to
the
well
myself
and
try
my
luck
to
think
how
sorry
i
was
for
miss
maggie
this
morning
thing
says
i
to
myself
be
kept
all
this
time
at
that
confounded
well
for
i
not
deny
that
i
swear
a
bit
to
myself
at
times
it
sweetens
the
blood
she
so
tired
i
thought
i
go
help
her
but
i
reckon
she
some
other
help
may
i
take
a
guess
at
the
young
man
four
thousand
nancy
said
browne
exultingly
and
a
blithe
look
and
a
warm
kind
heart
and
a
free
step
and
a
noble
way
with
him
to
rich
and
poor
aye
aye
i
know
the
name
no
need
to
alter
all
my
neat
done
in
cotton
well
well
every
one
turn
comes
sometime
but
mine
rather
long
the
faithful
old
servant
came
up
to
maggie
and
put
her
hand
caressingly
on
her
shoulder
maggie
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
kissed
the
brown
withered
face
god
bless
thee
bairn
said
nancy
solemnly
it
brought
the
low
music
of
peace
back
into
the
still
recesses
of
maggie
heart
she
began
to
look
out
for
her
lover
behind
the
muslin
window
curtain
which
waved
gently
to
and
fro
in
the
afternoon
breezes
she
heard
a
firm
buoyant
step
and
had
only
time
to
catch
one
glimpse
of
his
face
before
moving
away
but
that
one
glance
made
her
think
that
the
hours
which
had
elapsed
since
she
saw
him
had
not
been
serene
to
him
any
more
than
to
her
when
he
entered
the
parlor
his
face
was
glad
and
bright
he
went
up
in
a
frank
rejoicing
way
to
browne
who
was
evidently
rather
puzzled
how
to
receive
him
whether
as
maggie
betrothed
or
as
the
son
of
the
greatest
man
of
her
acquaintance
i
am
sure
sir
said
she
we
are
all
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
honor
you
have
done
our
family
he
looked
rather
perplexed
as
to
the
nature
of
the
honor
which
he
had
conferred
without
knowing
it
but
as
the
light
dawned
upon
him
he
made
answer
in
a
frank
merry
way
which
was
yet
full
of
respect
for
his
future
and
i
am
sure
i
am
truly
grateful
for
the
honor
one
of
your
family
has
done
me
when
nancy
brought
in
tea
she
was
dressed
in
her
sunday
gown
the
first
time
it
had
ever
been
worn
out
of
church
and
the
walk
to
and
fro
after
tea
frank
asked
maggie
if
she
would
walk
out
with
him
and
accordingly
they
climbed
the
and
went
out
upon
the
moors
which
seemed
vast
and
boundless
as
their
love
have
you
told
your
father
asked
maggie
a
dim
anxiety
lurking
in
her
heart
yes
said
frank
he
did
not
go
on
and
she
feared
to
ask
although
she
longed
to
know
how
buxton
had
received
the
intelligence
what
did
he
say
at
length
she
inquired
oh
it
was
evidently
a
new
idea
to
him
that
i
was
attached
to
you
and
he
does
not
take
up
a
new
idea
speedily
he
has
had
some
notion
it
seems
that
erminia
and
i
were
to
make
a
match
of
it
but
she
and
i
agreed
when
we
talked
it
over
that
we
should
never
have
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
if
there
had
not
been
another
human
being
in
the
world
erminia
is
a
little
sensible
creature
and
says
she
does
not
wonder
at
any
man
falling
in
love
with
you
nay
maggie
do
hang
your
head
so
down
let
me
have
a
glimpse
of
your
face
i
am
sorry
your
father
does
not
like
it
said
maggie
sorrowfully
so
am
i
but
we
must
give
him
time
to
get
reconciled
never
fear
but
he
will
like
it
in
the
long
run
he
has
too
much
good
taste
and
good
feeling
he
must
like
you
frank
did
not
choose
to
tell
even
maggie
how
violently
his
father
had
set
himself
against
their
engagement
he
was
surprised
and
annoyed
at
first
to
find
how
decidedly
his
father
was
possessed
with
the
idea
that
he
was
to
marry
his
cousin
and
that
she
at
any
rate
was
attached
to
him
whatever
his
feelings
might
be
toward
her
but
after
he
had
gone
frankly
to
erminia
and
told
her
all
he
found
that
she
was
as
ignorant
of
her
uncle
plans
for
her
as
he
had
been
and
almost
as
glad
at
any
event
which
should
frustrate
them
indeed
she
came
to
the
moorland
cottage
on
the
following
day
after
frank
had
returned
to
cambridge
she
had
left
her
horse
in
charge
of
the
groom
near
the
on
the
heights
and
came
running
down
the
slope
in
her
habit
maggie
went
out
to
meet
her
with
just
a
little
wonder
at
her
heart
if
what
frank
had
said
could
possibly
be
true
and
that
erminia
living
in
the
house
with
him
could
have
remained
indifferent
to
him
erminia
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
and
they
sat
down
together
on
the
i
durst
not
ride
down
that
hill
and
jem
is
holding
my
horse
so
i
may
not
stay
very
long
now
begin
maggie
at
once
and
go
into
a
rhapsody
about
frank
is
not
he
a
charming
fellow
oh
i
am
so
glad
now
do
sit
smiling
and
blushing
there
to
yourself
but
tell
me
a
great
deal
about
it
i
have
so
wanted
to
know
somebody
that
was
in
love
that
i
might
hear
what
it
was
like
and
the
minute
i
could
i
came
off
here
frank
is
only
just
gone
he
has
had
another
long
talk
with
my
uncle
since
he
came
back
from
you
this
morning
but
i
am
afraid
he
has
not
made
much
way
yet
maggie
sighed
i
do
wonder
at
his
not
thinking
me
good
enough
for
frank
no
the
difficulty
would
be
to
find
any
one
he
did
think
fit
for
his
paragon
of
a
son
he
thought
you
were
dearest
erminia
so
frank
has
told
you
that
has
he
i
suppose
we
shall
have
no
more
family
secrets
now
said
erminia
laughing
but
i
can
assure
you
i
had
a
strong
rival
in
lady
adela
castlemayne
the
duke
of
wight
daughter
she
was
the
most
beautiful
lady
my
uncle
had
ever
seen
he
only
saw
her
in
the
grand
stand
at
woodchester
races
and
never
spoke
a
word
to
her
in
his
life
and
if
she
would
have
had
frank
my
uncle
would
still
have
been
dissatisfied
as
long
as
the
princess
victoria
was
unmarried
none
would
have
been
good
enough
while
a
better
remained
but
maggie
said
she
smiling
up
into
her
friend
face
i
think
it
would
have
made
you
laugh
for
all
you
look
as
if
a
kiss
would
shake
the
tears
out
of
your
eyes
if
you
could
have
seen
my
uncle
manner
to
me
all
day
he
will
have
it
that
i
am
suffering
from
an
unrequited
attachment
so
he
watched
me
and
watched
me
over
breakfast
and
at
last
when
i
had
eaten
a
whole
of
eggs
and
i
do
know
how
many
pieces
of
toast
he
rang
the
bell
and
asked
for
some
potted
charr
i
was
quite
unconscious
that
it
was
for
me
and
i
did
not
want
it
when
it
came
so
he
sighed
in
a
most
melancholy
manner
and
said
poor
erminia
if
frank
had
not
been
there
and
looking
dreadfully
miserable
i
am
sure
i
should
have
laughed
out
did
frank
look
miserable
said
maggie
anxiously
there
now
you
do
care
for
anything
but
the
mention
of
his
name
but
did
he
look
unhappy
persisted
maggie
i
ca
say
he
looked
happy
dear
mousey
but
it
was
quite
different
when
he
came
back
from
seeing
you
you
know
you
always
had
the
art
of
stilling
any
person
trouble
you
and
my
aunt
buxton
are
the
only
two
i
ever
knew
with
that
gift
i
am
so
sorry
he
has
any
trouble
to
be
stilled
said
maggie
and
i
think
it
will
do
him
a
world
of
good
think
how
successful
his
life
has
been
the
honors
he
got
at
eton
his
picture
taken
and
i
know
what
and
at
cambridge
just
the
same
way
of
going
on
he
would
be
insufferably
imperious
in
a
few
years
if
he
did
not
meet
with
a
few
crosses
imperious
oh
erminia
how
can
you
say
so
because
it
the
truth
he
happens
to
have
very
good
dispositions
and
therefore
his
strong
will
is
not
either
disagreeable
or
offensive
but
once
let
him
become
possessed
by
a
wrong
wish
and
you
would
then
see
how
vehement
and
imperious
he
would
be
depend
upon
it
my
uncle
resistance
is
a
capital
thing
for
him
as
dear
sweet
aunt
buxton
would
have
said
is
a
holy
purpose
in
it
and
as
aunt
buxton
would
not
have
said
but
as
i
a
rush
in
where
angels
fear
to
tread
i
decide
that
the
purpose
is
to
teach
master
frank
patience
and
submission
erminia
how
could
you
help
and
there
maggie
stopped
i
know
what
you
mean
how
could
i
help
falling
in
love
with
him
i
think
he
has
not
mystery
and
reserve
enough
for
me
i
should
like
a
man
with
some
deep
impenetrable
darkness
around
him
something
one
could
always
keep
wondering
about
besides
think
what
clashing
of
wills
there
would
have
been
my
uncle
was
very
in
his
plan
but
i
do
think
he
thought
so
much
about
the
fitness
of
our
characters
and
ways
as
the
fitness
of
our
fortunes
for
shame
erminia
no
one
cares
less
for
money
than
mr
buxton
there
a
good
little
elect
but
seriously
i
do
think
he
is
beginning
to
care
for
money
not
in
the
least
for
himself
but
as
a
means
of
aggrandizement
for
frank
i
have
observed
since
i
came
home
at
christmas
a
growing
anxiety
to
make
the
most
of
his
property
a
thing
he
never
cared
about
before
i
do
think
he
is
aware
of
it
himself
but
from
one
or
two
little
things
i
have
noticed
i
should
not
wonder
if
he
ends
in
being
avaricious
in
his
old
age
erminia
sighed
maggie
had
almost
a
sympathy
with
the
father
who
sought
what
he
imagined
to
be
for
the
good
of
his
son
and
that
son
frank
although
she
was
as
convinced
as
erminia
that
money
could
not
really
help
any
one
to
happiness
she
could
not
at
the
instant
resist
saying
oh
how
i
wish
i
had
a
fortune
i
should
so
like
to
give
it
all
to
him
now
maggie
do
be
silly
i
never
heard
you
wish
for
anything
different
from
what
before
so
i
shall
take
this
opportunity
of
lecturing
you
on
your
folly
no
i
wo
either
for
you
look
sadly
tired
with
all
your
agitation
and
besides
i
must
go
or
jem
will
be
wondering
what
has
become
of
me
dearest
i
shall
come
very
often
to
see
you
and
perhaps
i
shall
give
you
my
lecture
yet
chapter
vi
it
was
true
of
buxton
as
well
as
of
his
son
that
he
had
the
seeds
of
imperiousness
in
him
his
life
had
not
been
such
as
to
call
them
out
into
view
with
more
wealth
than
he
required
with
a
gentle
wife
who
if
she
ruled
him
never
showed
it
or
was
conscious
of
the
fact
herself
looked
up
to
by
his
neighbors
a
simple
affectionate
set
of
people
whose
fathers
had
lived
near
his
father
and
grandfather
in
the
same
kindly
relation
receiving
benefits
cordially
given
and
requiting
them
with
good
will
and
respectful
attention
such
had
been
the
circumstances
surrounding
him
and
until
his
son
grew
out
of
childhood
there
had
not
seemed
a
wish
which
he
had
it
not
in
his
power
to
gratify
as
soon
as
formed
again
when
frank
was
at
school
and
at
college
all
went
on
prosperously
he
gained
honors
enough
to
satisfy
a
far
more
ambitious
father
indeed
it
was
the
honors
he
gained
that
stimulated
his
father
ambition
he
received
letters
from
tutors
and
headmasters
prophesying
that
if
frank
chose
he
might
rise
to
the
highest
honors
in
church
or
state
and
the
idea
thus
suggested
vague
as
it
was
remained
and
filled
buxton
mind
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
made
him
wish
that
his
own
career
had
been
such
as
would
have
led
him
to
form
connections
among
the
great
and
powerful
but
as
it
was
his
shyness
and
from
being
unaccustomed
to
society
had
made
him
averse
to
frank
occasional
requests
that
he
might
bring
such
and
such
a
or
home
on
a
visit
now
he
regretted
this
on
account
of
the
want
of
those
connections
which
might
thus
have
been
formed
and
in
his
visions
he
turned
to
marriage
as
the
best
way
of
remedying
this
erminia
was
right
in
saying
that
her
uncle
had
thought
of
lady
adela
castlemayne
for
an
instant
though
how
the
little
witch
had
found
it
out
i
can
not
say
as
the
idea
had
been
dismissed
immediately
from
his
mind
he
was
wise
enough
to
see
its
utter
vanity
as
long
as
his
son
remained
undistinguished
but
his
hope
was
this
if
frank
married
erminia
their
united
property
she
being
her
father
heiress
would
justify
him
in
standing
for
the
shire
or
if
he
could
marry
the
daughter
of
some
leading
personage
in
the
county
it
might
lead
to
the
same
step
and
thus
at
once
he
would
obtain
a
position
in
parliament
where
his
great
talents
would
have
scope
and
verge
enough
of
these
two
visions
the
favorite
one
for
his
sister
sake
was
that
of
marriage
with
erminia
and
in
the
midst
of
all
this
fell
like
a
bombshell
the
intelligence
of
his
engagement
with
maggie
browne
a
good
sweet
little
girl
enough
but
without
fortune
or
connection
without
as
far
as
buxton
knew
the
least
power
or
capability
or
spirit
with
which
to
help
frank
on
in
his
career
to
eminence
in
the
land
he
resolved
to
consider
if
as
a
boyish
fancy
easily
to
be
suppressed
and
it
down
to
frank
accordingly
he
remarked
his
son
set
lips
and
quiet
determined
brow
although
he
never
spoke
in
a
more
respectful
tone
than
while
thus
steadily
opposing
his
father
if
he
had
shown
more
violence
of
manner
he
would
have
irritated
him
less
but
as
it
was
if
was
the
most
miserable
interview
that
had
ever
taken
place
between
the
father
and
son
buxton
tried
to
calm
himself
down
with
believing
that
frank
would
change
his
mind
if
he
saw
more
of
the
world
but
somehow
he
had
a
prophesying
distrust
of
this
idea
internally
the
worst
was
there
was
no
fault
to
be
found
with
maggie
herself
although
she
might
want
the
accomplishments
he
desired
to
see
in
his
son
wife
her
connections
too
were
so
perfectly
respectable
though
humble
enough
in
comparison
with
buxton
soaring
wishes
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
objected
to
on
that
score
her
position
was
the
great
offence
in
proportion
to
his
want
of
any
reason
but
this
one
for
disapproving
of
the
engagement
was
his
annoyance
under
it
he
assumed
a
reserve
toward
frank
which
was
so
unusual
a
restraint
upon
his
open
genial
disposition
that
it
seemed
to
make
him
irritable
toward
all
others
in
contact
with
him
excepting
erminia
he
found
it
difficult
to
behave
rightly
to
maggie
like
all
habitually
cordial
persons
he
went
into
the
opposite
extreme
when
he
wanted
to
show
a
little
coolness
however
angry
he
might
be
with
the
events
of
which
she
was
the
cause
she
was
too
innocent
and
meek
to
justify
him
in
being
more
than
cool
but
his
awkwardness
was
so
great
that
many
a
man
of
the
world
has
met
his
greatest
enemy
each
knowing
the
other
hatred
with
less
freezing
distance
of
manner
than
buxton
to
maggie
while
she
went
simply
on
in
her
own
path
loving
him
the
more
through
all
for
old
kindness
sake
and
because
he
was
frank
father
he
shunned
meeting
her
with
such
evident
and
painful
anxiety
that
at
last
she
tried
to
spare
him
the
encounter
and
hurried
out
of
church
or
lingered
behind
all
in
order
to
avoid
the
only
chance
they
now
had
of
being
forced
to
speak
for
she
no
longer
went
to
the
dear
house
in
combehurst
though
erminia
came
to
see
her
more
than
ever
browne
was
perplexed
and
annoyed
beyond
measure
she
upbraided
buxton
to
every
one
but
maggie
to
her
she
said
any
one
in
their
senses
might
have
foreseen
what
had
happened
and
would
have
thought
well
about
it
before
they
went
and
fell
in
love
with
a
young
man
of
such
expectations
as
frank
buxton
in
the
middle
of
all
this
dismay
edward
came
over
from
woodchester
for
a
day
or
two
he
had
been
told
of
the
engagement
in
a
letter
from
maggie
herself
but
if
was
too
sacred
a
subject
for
her
to
enlarge
upon
to
him
and
browne
was
no
letter
writer
so
this
was
his
first
greeting
to
maggie
after
kissing
her
well
sancho
you
done
famously
for
yourself
as
soon
as
i
got
your
letter
i
said
to
harry
bish
waters
run
deep
here
my
little
sister
maggie
as
quiet
a
creature
as
ever
lived
has
managed
to
catch
young
buxton
who
has
five
thousand
if
he
a
penny
do
go
so
red
maggie
harry
was
sure
to
hear
of
if
soon
from
some
one
and
i
see
no
use
in
keeping
it
secret
for
it
gives
consequence
to
us
all
buxton
is
quite
put
out
about
it
said
brown
querulously
and
i
sure
he
need
not
be
for
he
enough
of
money
if
that
what
he
wants
and
maggie
father
was
a
clergyman
and
i
seen
with
my
own
eyes
on
old
buxton
lawrence
father
carts
and
a
clergyman
is
above
a
yeoman
any
day
but
if
maggie
had
had
any
thought
for
other
people
she
never
have
gone
and
engaged
herself
when
she
might
have
been
sure
it
would
give
offence
we
are
never
asked
down
to
dinner
now
never
broken
bread
there
since
last
christmas
whew
said
edward
to
this
it
was
a
disappointed
whistle
but
he
soon
cheered
up
i
thought
i
could
have
lent
a
hand
in
screwing
old
buxton
up
about
the
settlements
but
i
see
it
not
come
to
that
yet
still
i
go
and
see
the
old
gentleman
i
a
bit
of
a
favorite
of
his
and
i
doubt
i
can
turn
him
round
pray
edward
do
go
said
maggie
frank
and
i
are
content
to
wait
and
i
sure
we
would
rather
not
have
any
one
speak
to
buxton
upon
a
subject
which
evidently
gives
him
so
much
pain
please
edward
do
well
well
only
i
must
go
about
this
property
of
his
besides
i
mean
to
get
into
disgrace
so
i
sha
seem
to
know
anything
about
it
if
it
would
make
him
angry
i
want
to
keep
on
good
terms
because
of
the
agency
so
perhaps
i
shall
shake
my
head
and
think
it
great
presumption
in
you
maggie
to
have
thought
of
becoming
his
if
i
can
do
you
no
good
i
may
as
well
do
myself
some
i
hope
you
wo
mention
me
at
all
she
replied
one
comfort
and
almost
the
only
one
arising
from
edward
visit
was
that
she
could
now
often
be
spared
to
go
up
to
the
and
calm
down
her
anxiety
and
bring
all
discords
into
peace
under
the
sweet
influences
of
nature
buxton
had
tried
to
teach
her
the
force
of
the
lovely
truth
that
the
melodies
of
the
everlasting
chime
may
abide
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
ply
their
daily
task
in
towns
and
crowded
populous
places
and
that
solitude
is
not
needed
by
the
faithful
for
them
to
feel
the
immediate
presence
of
god
nor
utter
stillness
of
human
sound
necessary
before
they
can
hear
the
music
of
his
angels
footsteps
but
as
yet
her
soul
was
a
young
disciple
and
she
felt
it
easier
to
speak
to
him
and
come
to
him
for
help
sitting
lonely
with
wild
moors
swelling
and
darkening
around
her
and
not
a
creature
in
sight
but
the
white
specks
of
distant
sheep
and
the
birds
that
shun
the
haunts
of
men
floating
in
the
still
she
sometimes
longed
to
go
to
buxton
and
tell
him
how
much
she
could
sympathize
with
him
if
his
dislike
to
her
engagement
arose
from
thinking
her
unworthy
of
his
son
frank
character
seemed
to
her
grand
in
its
promise
with
vehement
impulses
and
natural
gifts
craving
worthy
employment
his
will
sat
supreme
over
all
like
a
young
emperor
calmly
seated
on
his
throne
whose
fiery
generals
and
wise
counsellors
stand
alike
ready
to
obey
him
but
if
marriage
were
to
be
made
by
due
measurement
and
balance
of
character
and
if
others
with
their
scales
were
to
be
the
judges
what
would
become
of
all
the
beautiful
services
rendered
by
the
loyalty
of
true
love
where
would
be
the
raising
up
of
the
weak
by
the
strong
or
the
patient
endurance
or
the
gracious
trust
of
her
whose
faith
is
fixt
and
can
not
move
she
darkly
feels
him
great
and
wise
she
dwells
on
him
with
faithful
eyes
can
not
understand
i
love
edward
manners
and
conduct
caused
her
more
real
anxiety
than
anything
else
indeed
no
other
thoughtfulness
could
be
called
anxiety
compared
to
this
his
faults
she
could
not
but
perceive
were
strengthening
with
his
strength
and
growing
with
his
growth
she
could
not
help
wondering
whence
he
obtained
the
money
to
pay
for
his
dress
which
she
thought
was
of
a
very
expensive
kind
she
heard
him
also
incidentally
allude
to
runs
up
to
town
of
which
at
the
time
neither
she
nor
her
mother
had
been
made
aware
he
seemed
confused
when
she
questioned
him
about
these
although
he
tried
to
laugh
it
off
and
asked
her
how
she
a
country
girl
cooped
up
among
one
set
of
people
could
have
any
idea
of
the
life
it
was
necessary
for
a
man
to
lead
who
had
any
hope
of
getting
on
in
the
world
he
must
have
acquaintances
and
connections
and
see
something
of
life
and
make
an
appearance
she
was
silenced
but
not
satisfied
nor
was
she
at
ease
with
regard
to
his
health
he
looked
ill
and
worn
and
when
he
was
not
rattling
and
laughing
his
face
fell
into
a
shape
of
anxiety
and
uneasiness
which
was
new
to
her
in
it
he
reminded
her
painfully
of
an
old
german
engraving
she
had
seen
in
buxton
portfolio
called
pleasure
digging
a
grave
pleasure
being
represented
by
a
ghastly
figure
of
a
young
man
eagerly
industrious
over
his
dismal
work
a
few
days
after
he
went
away
nancy
came
to
her
in
her
miss
maggie
said
she
may
i
just
speak
a
word
but
when
the
permission
was
given
she
hesitated
it
none
of
my
business
to
be
sure
said
she
at
last
only
you
see
i
lived
with
your
mother
ever
since
she
was
married
and
i
care
a
deal
for
both
you
and
master
edward
and
i
think
he
drains
missus
of
her
money
and
it
makes
me
not
easy
in
my
mind
you
did
not
know
of
it
but
he
had
his
father
old
watch
when
he
was
over
last
time
but
one
i
thought
he
was
of
an
age
to
have
a
watch
and
that
it
was
all
natural
but
i
reckon
sold
it
and
got
that
gimcrack
one
instead
that
perhaps
natural
too
young
folks
like
young
fashions
but
this
time
i
think
he
has
taken
away
your
mother
watch
at
least
i
never
seen
it
since
he
went
and
this
morning
she
spoke
to
me
about
my
wages
i
sure
i
never
asked
for
them
nor
troubled
her
but
i
own
it
now
near
on
to
twelve
months
since
she
paid
me
and
she
was
as
regular
as
till
then
now
miss
maggie
do
look
so
sorry
or
i
shall
wish
i
had
never
spoken
poor
missus
seemed
sadly
put
about
and
said
something
as
i
did
not
try
to
hear
for
i
was
so
vexed
she
should
think
i
needed
apologies
and
them
sort
of
things
rather
live
with
you
without
wages
than
have
her
look
so
as
she
did
this
morning
i
do
want
a
bit
for
money
my
dear
i
a
deal
in
the
bank
but
i
afeard
master
edward
is
spending
too
much
and
pinching
missus
maggie
was
very
sorry
indeed
her
mother
had
never
told
her
anything
of
all
this
so
it
was
evidently
a
painful
subject
to
her
and
maggie
determined
after
lying
awake
half
the
night
that
she
would
write
to
edward
and
remonstrate
with
him
and
that
in
every
personal
and
household
expense
she
would
be
more
than
ever
rigidly
economical
the
full
free
natural
intercourse
between
her
lover
and
herself
could
not
fail
to
be
checked
by
buxton
aversion
to
the
engagement
frank
came
over
for
some
time
in
the
early
autumn
he
had
left
cambridge
and
intended
to
enter
himself
at
the
temple
as
soon
as
the
vacation
was
ended
he
had
not
been
very
long
at
home
before
maggie
was
made
aware
partly
through
erminia
who
had
no
notion
of
discreet
silence
on
any
point
and
partly
by
her
own
observation
of
the
increasing
estrangement
between
father
and
son
buxton
was
reserved
with
frank
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
frank
was
depressed
and
annoyed
at
his
father
obstinate
repetition
of
the
same
sentence
in
answer
to
all
his
arguments
in
favor
of
his
engagement
arguments
which
were
overwhelming
to
himself
and
which
it
required
an
effort
of
patience
on
his
part
to
go
over
and
recapitulate
so
obvious
was
the
conclusion
and
then
to
have
the
same
answer
forever
the
same
words
even
frank
it
no
use
talking
i
do
approve
of
the
engagement
and
never
shall
he
would
snatch
up
his
hat
and
hurry
off
to
maggie
to
be
soothed
his
father
knew
where
he
was
gone
without
being
told
and
was
jealous
of
her
influence
over
the
son
who
had
long
been
his
first
and
paramount
object
in
life
he
needed
not
have
been
jealous
however
angry
and
indignant
frank
was
when
he
went
up
to
the
moorland
cottage
maggie
almost
persuaded
him
before
half
an
hour
had
elapsed
that
his
father
was
but
unreasonable
from
his
extreme
affection
still
she
saw
that
such
frequent
differences
would
weaken
the
bond
between
father
and
son
and
accordingly
she
urged
frank
to
accept
an
invitation
into
scotland
you
told
me
said
she
that
buxton
will
have
it
it
is
but
a
attachment
and
that
when
you
have
seen
other
people
you
will
change
your
mind
now
do
try
how
far
you
can
stand
the
effects
of
absence
she
said
it
playfully
but
he
was
in
a
humor
to
be
vexed
what
nonsense
maggie
you
do
care
for
all
this
delay
yourself
and
you
take
up
my
father
bad
reasons
as
if
you
believed
them
i
do
believe
them
but
still
they
may
be
true
how
should
you
like
it
maggie
if
i
urged
you
to
go
about
and
see
something
of
society
and
try
if
you
could
not
find
some
one
you
liked
better
it
is
more
probable
in
your
case
than
in
mine
for
you
have
never
been
from
home
and
i
have
been
half
over
europe
you
are
very
much
afraid
are
not
you
frank
said
she
her
face
bright
with
blushes
and
her
gray
eyes
smiling
up
at
him
i
have
a
great
idea
that
if
i
could
see
that
harry
bish
that
edward
is
always
talking
about
i
should
be
charmed
he
must
wear
such
beautiful
waistcoats
do
you
think
i
had
better
see
him
before
our
engagement
is
quite
quite
final
but
frank
would
not
smile
in
fact
like
all
angry
persons
he
found
fresh
matter
for
offence
in
every
sentence
she
did
not
consider
the
engagement
as
quite
final
thus
he
chose
to
understand
her
playful
speech
he
would
not
answer
she
spoke
again
dear
frank
you
are
not
angry
with
me
are
you
it
is
nonsense
to
think
that
we
are
to
go
about
the
world
picking
and
choosing
men
and
women
as
if
they
were
fruit
and
we
were
to
gather
the
best
as
if
there
was
not
something
in
our
own
hearts
which
if
we
listen
to
it
conscientiously
will
tell
us
at
once
when
we
have
met
the
one
of
all
others
there
now
am
i
sensible
i
suppose
i
am
for
your
grim
features
are
relaxing
into
a
smile
that
right
but
now
listen
to
this
i
think
your
father
would
come
round
sooner
if
he
were
not
irritated
every
day
by
the
knowledge
of
your
visits
to
me
if
you
went
away
he
would
know
that
we
should
write
to
each
other
yet
he
would
forget
the
exact
time
when
but
now
he
knows
as
well
as
i
do
where
you
are
when
you
are
up
here
and
i
fancy
from
what
erminia
says
it
makes
him
angry
the
whole
time
you
are
away
frank
was
silent
at
last
he
said
it
is
rather
provoking
to
be
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
there
is
some
truth
in
what
you
say
but
even
if
i
would
i
am
not
sure
that
i
could
go
my
father
does
not
speak
to
me
about
his
affairs
as
he
used
to
do
so
i
was
rather
surprised
yesterday
to
hear
him
say
to
erminia
though
i
sure
he
meant
the
information
for
me
that
he
had
engaged
an
agent
then
there
will
be
the
less
occasion
for
you
to
be
at
home
he
wo
want
your
help
in
his
accounts
i
given
him
little
enough
of
that
i
have
long
wanted
him
to
have
somebody
to
look
after
his
affairs
they
are
very
complicated
and
he
is
very
careless
but
i
believe
my
signature
will
be
wanted
for
some
new
leases
at
least
he
told
me
so
that
need
not
take
you
long
said
maggie
not
the
mere
signing
but
i
want
to
know
something
more
about
the
property
and
the
proposed
tenants
i
believe
this
henry
that
my
father
has
engaged
is
a
very
hard
sort
of
man
he
is
what
is
called
scrupulously
honest
and
honorable
but
i
fear
a
little
too
much
inclined
to
drive
hard
bargains
for
his
client
now
i
want
to
be
convinced
to
the
contrary
if
i
can
before
i
leave
my
father
in
his
hands
so
you
cruel
judge
you
transport
me
yet
will
you
no
said
maggie
overjoyed
at
her
own
decision
and
blushing
her
delight
that
her
reason
was
convinced
it
was
right
for
frank
to
stay
a
little
longer
the
next
day
post
brought
her
a
letter
from
edward
there
was
not
a
word
in
it
about
her
inquiry
or
remonstrance
it
might
never
have
been
written
or
never
received
but
a
few
hurried
anxious
lines
asking
her
to
write
by
return
of
post
and
say
if
it
was
really
true
that
buxton
had
engaged
an
agent
it
a
confounded
shabby
trick
if
he
has
after
what
he
said
to
me
long
ago
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
i
depend
on
your
complying
with
my
request
once
more
if
nancy
can
not
take
the
letter
to
the
post
run
down
to
combehurst
with
it
yourself
i
must
have
an
answer
and
every
particular
as
to
who
when
to
be
appointed
but
i
ca
believe
the
report
to
be
true
maggie
asked
frank
if
she
might
name
what
he
had
told
her
the
day
before
to
her
brother
he
said
oh
yes
certainly
if
he
cares
to
know
of
course
you
will
not
say
anything
about
my
own
opinion
of
henry
he
is
coming
and
i
shall
be
able
to
judge
how
far
i
am
right
chapter
vii
the
next
day
henry
came
he
was
a
quiet
man
of
considerable
intelligence
and
refinement
and
so
much
taste
for
music
as
to
charm
erminia
who
had
rather
dreaded
his
visit
but
all
the
amenities
of
life
were
put
aside
when
he
entered
buxton
sanctum
his
office
as
he
called
the
room
where
he
received
his
tenants
and
business
people
frank
thought
henry
was
scarce
commonly
civil
in
the
open
evidence
of
his
surprise
and
contempt
for
the
habits
of
which
the
disorderly
books
and
ledgers
were
but
too
visible
signs
buxton
himself
felt
more
like
a
bringing
up
an
imperfect
lesson
than
he
had
ever
done
since
he
was
thirteen
the
only
wonder
my
good
sir
is
that
you
have
any
property
left
that
you
have
not
been
cheated
out
of
every
farthing
i
answer
for
it
said
buxton
in
reply
that
you
not
find
any
cheating
has
been
going
on
they
dared
not
sir
they
know
i
should
make
an
example
of
the
first
rogue
i
found
out
henry
lifted
up
his
eyebrows
but
did
not
speak
besides
sir
most
of
these
men
have
lived
for
generations
under
the
buxtons
i
give
you
my
life
they
would
not
cheat
me
henry
coldly
said
i
imagine
a
close
examination
of
these
books
by
some
accountant
will
be
the
best
proof
of
the
honesty
of
these
said
tenants
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
write
to
a
clever
fellow
i
know
and
desire
him
to
come
down
and
try
and
regulate
this
mass
of
papers
anything
anything
you
like
said
buxton
only
too
glad
to
escape
from
the
lawyer
cold
contemptuous
way
of
treating
the
subject
the
accountant
came
and
he
and
henry
were
deeply
engaged
in
the
office
for
several
days
buxton
was
bewildered
by
the
questions
they
asked
him
henry
examined
him
in
the
worrying
way
in
which
an
unwilling
witness
is
made
to
give
evidence
many
a
time
and
oft
did
he
heartily
wish
he
had
gone
on
in
the
old
course
to
the
end
of
his
life
instead
of
putting
himself
into
an
agent
hands
but
he
comforted
himself
by
thinking
that
at
any
rate
they
would
be
convinced
he
had
never
allowed
himself
to
be
cheated
or
imposed
upon
although
he
did
not
make
any
parade
of
exactitude
what
was
his
dismay
when
one
morning
henry
sent
to
request
his
presence
and
with
a
cold
clear
voice
read
aloud
an
admirably
drawn
up
statement
informing
the
poor
landlord
of
the
defalcations
nay
more
the
impositions
of
those
whom
he
had
trusted
if
he
had
been
alone
he
would
have
burst
into
tears
to
find
how
his
confidence
had
been
abused
but
as
it
was
he
became
passionately
angry
i
prosecute
them
sir
not
a
man
shall
escape
i
make
them
pay
back
every
farthing
i
will
and
damages
too
crayston
did
you
say
sir
was
that
one
of
the
names
why
that
is
the
very
crayston
who
was
bailiff
under
my
father
for
years
the
scoundrel
and
i
set
him
up
in
my
best
farm
when
he
married
and
he
been
swindling
me
has
he
henry
ran
over
the
items
of
the
account
part
of
this
i
fear
we
can
not
recover
he
was
going
on
but
buxton
broke
in
but
i
will
recover
it
have
every
farthing
of
it
i
go
to
law
with
the
viper
i
do
care
for
money
but
i
hate
ingratitude
if
you
like
i
will
take
counsel
opinion
on
the
case
said
henry
coolly
take
anything
you
please
sir
why
this
crayston
was
the
first
man
that
set
me
on
a
horse
and
to
think
of
his
cheating
me
a
few
days
after
this
conversation
frank
came
on
his
usual
visit
to
maggie
can
you
come
up
to
the
dearest
said
he
it
is
a
lovely
day
and
i
want
the
solace
of
a
quiet
hour
talk
with
you
so
they
went
and
sat
in
silence
some
time
looking
at
the
calm
and
still
blue
air
about
the
summits
of
the
hills
where
never
tumult
of
the
world
came
to
disturb
the
peace
and
the
quiet
of
whose
heights
was
never
broken
by
the
loud
passionate
cries
of
men
i
am
glad
you
like
my
said
maggie
i
like
the
view
from
it
the
thought
of
the
solitude
which
must
be
among
the
hollows
of
those
hills
pleases
me
particularly
oh
maggie
it
is
one
of
the
times
when
i
get
depressed
about
men
and
the
world
we
have
had
such
sorrow
and
such
revelations
and
remorse
and
passion
at
home
crayston
my
father
old
tenant
has
come
over
it
seems
i
am
afraid
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
he
has
been
peculating
to
a
large
amount
my
father
has
been
too
careless
and
has
placed
his
dependents
in
great
temptation
and
crayston
he
is
an
old
man
with
a
large
extravagant
family
has
yielded
he
has
been
served
with
notice
of
my
intention
to
prosecute
him
and
came
over
to
confess
all
and
ask
for
forgiveness
and
time
to
pay
back
what
he
could
a
month
ago
my
father
would
have
listened
to
him
i
think
but
now
he
is
stung
by
sayings
and
gave
way
to
a
furious
passion
it
has
been
a
most
distressing
morning
the
worst
side
of
everybody
seems
to
have
come
out
even
crayston
with
all
his
penitence
and
appearance
of
candor
had
to
be
questioned
closely
by
henry
before
he
would
tell
the
whole
truth
good
god
that
money
should
have
such
power
to
corrupt
men
it
was
all
for
money
and
money
worth
that
this
degradation
has
taken
place
as
for
henry
to
save
his
client
money
and
to
protect
money
he
does
not
care
he
does
not
even
perceive
how
he
induces
deterioration
of
character
he
has
been
encouraging
my
father
in
measures
which
i
can
not
call
anything
but
vindictive
crayston
is
to
be
made
an
example
of
they
say
as
if
my
father
had
not
half
the
sin
on
his
own
head
as
if
he
had
rightly
discharged
his
duties
as
a
rich
man
money
was
as
dross
to
him
but
he
ought
to
have
remembered
how
it
might
be
as
life
itself
to
many
and
be
craved
after
and
coveted
till
the
black
longing
got
the
better
of
principle
as
it
has
done
with
this
poor
crayston
they
say
the
man
was
once
so
truthful
and
now
his
is
gone
and
he
has
evidently
lost
the
very
nature
of
truth
i
dread
riches
i
dread
the
responsibility
of
them
at
any
rate
i
wish
i
had
begun
life
as
a
poor
boy
and
worked
my
way
up
to
competence
then
i
could
understand
and
remember
the
temptations
of
poverty
i
am
afraid
of
my
own
heart
becoming
hardened
as
my
father
is
you
have
no
notion
of
his
passionate
severity
maggie
it
was
quite
a
new
thing
even
to
me
it
will
only
be
for
a
short
time
said
she
he
must
be
much
grieved
about
this
man
if
i
thought
i
could
ever
grow
as
hard
and
different
to
the
abject
entreaties
of
a
criminal
as
my
father
has
been
this
morning
one
whom
he
has
helped
to
make
too
i
would
go
off
to
australia
at
once
indeed
maggie
i
think
it
would
be
the
best
thing
we
could
do
my
heart
aches
about
the
mysterious
corruptions
and
evils
of
an
old
state
of
society
such
as
we
have
in
what
do
you
say
maggie
would
you
go
she
was
silent
thinking
i
would
go
with
you
directly
if
it
were
right
said
she
at
last
but
would
it
be
i
think
it
would
be
rather
cowardly
i
feel
what
you
say
but
do
you
think
it
would
be
braver
to
stay
and
endure
much
depression
and
anxiety
of
mind
for
the
sake
of
the
good
those
always
can
do
who
see
evils
clearly
i
am
speaking
all
this
time
as
if
neither
you
nor
i
had
any
home
duties
but
were
free
to
do
as
me
liked
what
can
you
or
i
do
we
are
less
than
drops
in
the
ocean
as
far
as
our
influence
can
go
to
model
a
nation
as
for
that
said
maggie
laughing
i
ca
remodel
ways
so
i
never
yet
planned
how
to
remodel
a
nation
then
what
did
you
mean
by
the
good
those
always
can
do
who
see
evils
clearly
the
evils
i
see
are
those
of
a
nation
whose
god
is
money
that
is
just
because
you
have
come
away
from
a
distressing
scene
you
will
hear
or
read
of
some
heroic
action
meeting
with
a
nation
sympathy
and
you
will
rejoice
and
be
proud
of
your
country
still
i
shall
see
the
evils
of
her
complex
state
of
society
keenly
and
where
is
the
good
i
can
do
oh
i
ca
tell
in
a
minute
but
can
not
you
bravely
face
these
evils
and
learn
their
nature
and
causes
and
then
has
god
given
you
no
powers
to
apply
to
the
discovery
of
their
remedy
dear
frank
think
it
may
be
very
little
you
can
do
and
you
may
never
see
the
effect
of
it
any
more
than
the
widow
saw
the
effect
of
her
mite
then
if
all
the
good
and
thoughtful
men
run
away
from
us
to
some
new
country
what
are
we
to
do
with
our
poor
dear
old
england
oh
you
must
run
away
with
the
good
thoughtful
men
i
mean
to
consider
that
as
a
compliment
to
myself
maggie
will
you
let
me
wish
i
had
been
born
poor
if
i
am
to
stay
in
england
i
should
not
then
be
liable
to
this
fault
into
which
i
see
the
rich
men
fall
of
forgetting
the
trials
of
the
poor
i
am
not
sure
whether
if
you
had
been
poor
you
might
not
have
fallen
into
an
exactly
parallel
fault
and
forgotten
the
trials
of
the
rich
it
is
so
difficult
to
understand
the
errors
into
which
their
position
makes
all
men
liable
to
fall
do
you
remember
a
story
in
at
home
called
the
transmigrations
of
indra
well
when
i
was
a
child
i
used
to
wish
i
might
be
transmigrated
is
that
the
right
word
into
an
american
for
a
little
while
just
that
i
might
understand
how
he
must
suffer
and
be
sorely
puzzled
and
pray
and
long
to
be
freed
from
his
odious
wealth
till
at
last
he
grew
hardened
to
its
nature
and
since
then
i
have
wished
to
be
the
emperor
of
russia
for
the
same
reason
ah
you
may
laugh
but
that
is
only
because
i
have
not
explained
myself
properly
i
was
only
smiling
to
think
how
ambitious
any
one
might
suppose
you
were
who
did
not
know
you
i
do
see
any
ambition
in
it
i
do
think
of
the
station
i
only
want
sorely
to
see
the
resisted
of
burns
in
order
that
i
may
have
more
charity
for
those
who
seem
to
me
to
have
been
the
cause
of
such
infinite
woe
and
misery
done
we
partly
may
compute
but
know
not
what
resisted
repeated
frank
musingly
after
some
time
he
began
again
but
maggie
i
do
give
up
this
wish
of
mine
to
go
to
australia
canada
if
you
like
it
better
anywhere
where
there
is
a
newer
and
purer
state
of
society
the
great
objection
seems
to
be
your
duty
as
an
only
child
to
your
father
it
is
different
to
the
case
of
one
out
of
a
large
family
i
wish
i
were
one
in
twenty
then
i
might
marry
where
i
liked
it
would
take
two
people
consent
to
such
a
rapid
measure
said
maggie
laughing
but
now
i
am
going
to
wish
a
wish
which
it
wo
require
a
fairy
godmother
to
gratify
look
frank
do
you
see
in
the
middle
of
that
dark
brown
purple
streak
of
moor
a
yellow
gleam
of
light
it
is
a
pond
i
think
that
at
this
time
of
the
year
catches
a
slanting
beam
of
the
sun
it
can
not
be
very
far
off
i
have
wished
to
go
to
it
every
autumn
will
you
go
with
me
now
we
shall
have
time
before
tea
frank
dissatisfaction
with
the
stern
measures
that
urged
on
by
henry
his
father
took
against
all
who
had
imposed
upon
his
carelessness
as
a
landlord
increased
rather
than
diminished
he
spoke
warmly
to
him
on
the
subject
but
without
avail
he
remonstrated
with
henry
and
told
him
how
he
felt
that
had
his
father
controlled
his
careless
nature
and
been
an
exact
vigilant
landlord
these
tenantry
would
never
have
had
the
great
temptation
to
do
him
wrong
and
that
therefore
he
considered
some
allowance
should
be
made
for
them
and
some
opportunity
given
them
to
redeem
their
characters
which
would
be
blasted
and
hardened
for
ever
by
the
publicity
of
a
but
henry
only
raised
his
eyebrows
and
made
answer
i
like
to
see
these
notions
in
a
young
man
sir
i
had
them
myself
at
your
age
i
believe
i
had
great
ideas
then
on
the
subject
of
temptation
and
the
force
of
circumstances
and
was
as
quixotic
as
any
one
about
reforming
rogues
but
my
experience
has
convinced
me
that
roguery
is
innate
nothing
but
outward
force
can
control
it
and
keep
it
within
bounds
the
terrors
of
the
law
must
be
that
outward
force
i
admire
your
kindness
of
heart
and
in
we
do
not
look
for
the
wisdom
and
experience
of
forty
or
fifty
frank
was
indignant
at
being
set
aside
as
an
unripe
youth
he
disapproved
so
strongly
of
all
these
measures
and
of
so
much
that
was
now
going
on
at
home
under
henry
influence
that
he
determined
to
pay
his
long
promised
visit
to
scotland
and
maggie
sad
at
heart
to
see
how
he
was
suffering
encouraged
him
in
his
determination
chapter
viii
after
he
was
gone
there
came
a
november
of
the
most
dreary
and
characteristic
kind
there
was
incessant
rain
and
mists
without
a
gleam
of
sunshine
to
light
up
the
drops
of
water
and
make
the
wet
stems
and
branches
of
the
trees
glisten
every
color
seemed
dimmed
and
darkened
and
the
crisp
autumnal
glory
of
leaves
fell
soddened
to
the
ground
the
latest
flowers
rotted
away
without
ever
coming
to
their
bloom
and
it
looked
as
if
the
heavy
monotonous
sky
had
drawn
closer
and
closer
and
shut
in
the
little
moorland
cottage
as
with
a
shroud
in
doors
things
were
no
more
cheerful
maggie
saw
that
her
mother
was
depressed
and
she
thought
that
edward
extravagance
must
be
the
occasion
oftentimes
she
wondered
how
far
she
might
speak
on
the
subject
and
once
or
twice
she
drew
near
it
in
conversation
but
her
mother
winced
away
and
maggie
could
not
as
yet
see
any
decided
good
to
be
gained
from
encountering
such
pain
to
herself
it
would
have
been
a
relief
to
have
known
the
truth
the
worst
as
far
as
her
mother
knew
it
but
she
was
not
in
the
habit
of
thinking
of
herself
she
only
tried
by
long
tender
attention
to
cheer
and
comfort
her
mother
and
she
and
nancy
strove
in
every
way
to
reduce
the
household
expenditure
for
there
was
little
ready
money
to
meet
it
maggie
wrote
regularly
to
edward
but
since
the
note
inquiring
about
the
agency
she
had
never
heard
from
him
whether
her
mother
received
letters
she
did
not
know
but
at
any
rate
she
did
not
express
anxiety
though
her
looks
and
manner
betrayed
that
she
was
ill
at
ease
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
maggie
when
some
change
was
given
to
her
thoughts
by
nancy
becoming
ill
the
damp
gloomy
weather
brought
on
some
kind
of
rheumatic
attack
which
obliged
the
old
servant
to
keep
her
bed
formerly
in
such
an
emergency
they
would
have
engaged
some
cottager
wife
to
come
and
do
the
but
now
it
seemed
tacitly
understood
that
they
could
not
afford
it
even
when
nancy
grew
worse
and
required
attendance
in
the
night
maggie
still
persisted
in
her
daily
occupations
she
was
wise
enough
to
rest
when
and
how
she
could
and
with
a
little
forethought
she
hoped
to
be
able
to
go
through
this
weary
time
without
any
bad
effect
one
morning
it
was
on
the
second
of
december
and
even
the
change
of
name
in
the
month
although
it
brought
no
change
of
circumstances
or
weather
was
a
relief
december
brought
glad
tidings
even
in
its
very
name
one
morning
dim
and
dreary
maggie
had
looked
at
the
clock
on
leaving
nancy
room
and
finding
it
was
not
yet
five
and
knowing
that
her
mother
and
nancy
were
both
asleep
she
determined
to
lie
down
and
rest
for
an
hour
before
getting
up
to
light
the
fires
she
did
not
mean
to
go
to
sleep
but
she
was
tired
out
and
fell
into
a
sound
slumber
when
she
awoke
it
was
with
a
start
it
was
still
dark
but
she
had
a
clear
idea
of
being
wakened
by
some
distinct
rattling
noise
there
it
was
once
more
against
the
window
like
a
shower
of
shot
she
went
to
the
lattice
and
opened
it
to
look
out
she
had
that
strange
consciousness
not
to
be
described
of
the
near
neighborhood
of
some
human
creature
although
she
neither
saw
nor
heard
any
one
for
the
first
instant
then
edward
spoke
in
a
hoarse
whisper
right
below
the
window
standing
on
the
maggie
maggie
come
down
and
let
me
in
for
your
life
do
make
any
noise
no
one
must
know
maggie
turned
sick
something
was
wrong
evidently
and
she
was
weak
and
weary
however
she
stole
down
the
old
creaking
stairs
and
undid
the
heavy
bolt
and
let
her
brother
in
she
felt
that
his
dress
was
quite
wet
and
she
led
him
with
cautious
steps
into
the
kitchen
and
shut
the
door
and
stirred
the
fire
before
she
spoke
he
sank
into
a
chair
as
if
worn
out
with
fatigue
she
stood
expecting
some
explanation
but
when
she
saw
he
could
not
speak
she
hastened
to
make
him
a
cup
of
tea
and
stooping
down
took
off
his
wet
boots
and
helped
him
off
with
his
coat
and
brought
her
own
plaid
to
wrap
round
him
all
this
time
her
heart
sunk
lower
and
lower
he
allowed
her
to
do
what
she
liked
as
if
he
were
an
automaton
his
head
and
his
arms
hung
loosely
down
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
in
a
glaring
way
on
the
fire
when
she
brought
him
some
tea
he
spoke
for
the
first
time
she
could
not
hear
what
he
said
till
he
repeated
it
so
husky
was
his
voice
have
you
no
brandy
she
had
the
key
of
the
little
and
fetched
up
some
but
as
she
took
a
to
measure
if
out
he
tremblingly
clutched
at
the
bottle
and
shook
down
a
quantity
into
the
empty
and
drank
it
off
at
one
gulp
he
fell
back
again
in
his
chair
but
in
a
few
minutes
he
roused
himself
and
seemed
stronger
edward
dear
edward
what
is
the
matter
said
maggie
at
last
for
he
got
up
and
was
staggering
toward
the
outer
door
as
if
he
were
going
once
more
into
the
rain
and
dismal
he
looked
at
her
fiercely
as
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
confound
you
do
touch
me
i
not
be
kept
here
to
be
caught
and
hung
for
an
instant
she
thought
he
was
mad
caught
and
hung
she
echoed
my
poor
edward
what
do
you
mean
he
sat
down
suddenly
on
a
chair
close
by
him
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
feeble
and
imploring
the
police
are
after
me
maggie
what
must
i
do
oh
can
you
hide
me
can
you
save
me
he
looked
wild
like
a
hunted
creature
maggie
stood
aghast
he
went
on
my
mother
nancy
where
are
they
i
was
wet
through
and
starving
and
i
came
here
do
let
them
take
me
maggie
till
i
stronger
and
can
give
battle
oh
edward
edward
what
are
you
saying
said
maggie
sitting
down
on
the
dresser
in
absolute
bewildered
despair
what
have
you
done
i
hardly
know
i
in
a
horrid
dream
i
see
you
think
i
mad
i
wish
i
were
wo
nancy
come
down
soon
you
must
hide
me
poor
nancy
is
ill
in
bed
said
maggie
thank
god
said
he
there
one
less
but
my
mother
will
be
up
soon
will
she
not
not
yet
replied
maggie
edward
dear
do
try
and
tell
me
what
you
have
done
why
should
the
police
be
after
you
why
maggie
said
he
with
a
kind
of
forced
unnatural
laugh
they
say
i
forged
and
have
you
asked
maggie
in
a
still
low
tone
of
quiet
agony
he
did
not
answer
for
some
time
but
sat
looking
on
the
floor
with
unwinking
eyes
at
last
he
said
as
if
speaking
to
himself
if
i
have
it
no
more
than
others
have
done
before
and
never
been
found
out
i
was
but
borrowing
money
i
meant
to
repay
it
if
i
had
asked
buxton
he
would
have
lent
it
me
mr
buxton
said
maggie
yes
answered
he
looking
sharply
and
suddenly
up
at
her
your
future
my
father
old
friend
it
is
he
that
is
hunting
me
to
death
no
need
to
look
so
white
and
maggie
it
the
way
of
the
world
as
i
might
have
known
if
i
had
not
been
a
blind
fool
mr
buxton
she
whispered
faintly
oh
maggie
said
he
suddenly
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
save
me
you
can
do
it
write
to
frank
and
make
him
induce
his
father
to
let
me
off
i
came
to
see
you
my
sweet
merciful
sister
i
knew
you
would
save
me
good
god
what
noise
is
that
there
are
steps
in
the
yard
and
before
she
could
speak
he
had
rushed
into
the
little
china
closet
which
opened
out
of
the
parlor
and
crouched
down
in
the
darkness
it
was
only
the
man
who
brought
their
morning
supply
of
milk
from
a
neighboring
farm
but
when
maggie
opened
the
kitchen
door
she
saw
how
the
cold
pale
light
of
a
winter
day
had
filled
the
air
you
late
with
your
shutters
miss
said
the
man
i
hope
nancy
has
not
been
giving
you
all
a
bad
night
says
i
to
thomas
who
came
with
me
to
the
gate
many
a
year
since
i
saw
them
parlor
shutters
barred
up
at
eight
maggie
went
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
and
opened
all
the
low
windows
in
order
that
they
might
look
as
usual
she
wondered
at
her
own
outward
composure
while
she
felt
so
dead
and
sick
at
heart
her
mother
would
soon
get
up
must
she
be
told
edward
spoke
to
her
now
and
then
from
his
he
dared
not
go
back
into
the
kitchen
into
which
the
few
neighbors
they
had
were
apt
to
come
on
their
morning
way
to
combehurst
to
ask
if
they
could
do
any
errands
there
for
browne
or
nancy
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
had
elapsed
since
the
first
alarm
when
as
maggie
was
trying
to
light
the
parlor
fire
in
order
that
the
doctor
when
he
came
might
find
all
as
usual
she
heard
the
click
of
the
garden
gate
and
a
man
step
coming
along
the
walk
she
ran
up
stairs
to
wash
away
the
traces
of
the
tears
which
had
been
streaming
down
her
face
as
she
went
about
her
work
before
she
opened
the
door
there
against
the
watery
light
of
the
rainy
day
without
stood
buxton
he
hardly
spoke
to
her
but
pushed
past
her
and
entered
the
parlor
he
sat
down
looking
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
maggie
tried
to
keep
down
her
shivering
alarm
it
was
long
since
she
had
seen
him
and
the
old
idea
of
his
kind
genial
disposition
had
been
sadly
disturbed
by
what
she
had
heard
from
frank
of
his
severe
proceedings
against
his
unworthy
tenantry
and
now
if
he
was
setting
the
police
in
search
of
edward
he
was
indeed
to
be
dreaded
and
with
edward
so
close
at
hand
within
earshot
if
the
china
fell
he
would
suspect
nothing
from
that
it
would
only
be
her
own
terror
if
her
mother
came
down
but
with
all
these
thoughts
she
was
very
still
outwardly
as
she
sat
waiting
for
him
to
speak
have
you
heard
from
your
brother
lately
asked
he
looking
up
in
an
angry
and
disturbed
manner
but
i
answer
for
it
he
has
not
been
writing
home
for
some
time
he
could
not
with
the
guilt
he
has
had
on
his
mind
not
believe
in
gratitude
again
there
perhaps
was
such
a
thing
once
but
the
more
you
do
for
a
person
the
surer
they
are
to
turn
against
you
and
cheat
you
now
do
go
white
and
pale
i
know
you
a
good
girl
in
the
main
and
i
been
lying
awake
all
night
and
i
a
deal
to
say
to
you
that
scoundrel
of
a
brother
of
yours
maggie
could
not
ask
as
would
have
been
natural
if
she
had
been
ignorant
what
edward
had
done
she
knew
too
well
but
buxton
was
too
full
of
his
own
thoughts
and
feelings
to
notice
her
much
do
you
know
he
has
been
like
the
rest
do
you
know
he
has
been
cheating
me
forging
my
name
i
do
know
what
besides
it
well
for
him
that
they
altered
the
laws
and
he
ca
be
hung
for
it
a
dead
heavy
weight
was
removed
from
maggie
mind
but
henry
is
going
to
transport
him
it
worse
than
crayston
crayston
only
ploughed
up
the
turf
and
did
not
pay
rent
and
sold
the
timber
thinking
i
should
never
miss
it
but
your
brother
has
gone
and
forged
my
name
he
had
received
all
the
while
he
only
gave
me
half
and
said
the
rest
was
to
come
afterward
and
the
ungrateful
scoundrel
has
gone
and
given
a
forged
receipt
you
might
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
straw
when
henry
told
me
about
it
all
last
night
talk
to
me
of
virtue
and
such
humbug
again
i
said
never
believe
in
them
every
one
is
for
what
he
can
get
however
henry
wrote
to
the
superintendent
of
police
at
woodchester
and
has
gone
over
himself
this
morning
to
see
after
it
but
to
think
of
your
father
having
such
a
son
oh
my
poor
father
sobbed
out
maggie
how
glad
i
am
you
are
dead
before
this
disgrace
came
upon
us
you
may
well
say
disgrace
you
a
good
girl
yourself
maggie
i
have
always
said
that
how
edward
has
turned
out
as
he
has
done
i
can
not
conceive
but
now
maggie
i
something
to
say
to
you
he
moved
uneasily
about
as
if
he
did
not
know
how
to
begin
maggie
was
standing
leaning
her
head
against
the
longing
for
her
visitor
to
go
dreading
the
next
minute
and
wishing
to
shrink
into
some
dark
corner
of
oblivion
where
she
might
forget
all
for
a
time
till
she
regained
a
small
portion
of
the
bodily
strength
that
had
been
sorely
tried
of
late
buxton
saw
her
white
look
of
anguish
and
read
it
in
part
but
not
wholly
he
was
too
intent
on
what
he
was
going
to
say
i
been
lying
awake
all
night
thinking
you
see
the
disgrace
it
is
to
you
though
you
are
innocent
and
i
sure
you
ca
think
of
involving
frank
in
it
maggie
went
to
the
little
sofa
and
kneeling
down
by
it
hid
her
face
in
the
cushions
he
did
not
go
on
for
he
thought
she
was
not
listening
to
him
at
last
he
said
come
now
be
a
sensible
girl
and
face
it
out
i
a
plan
to
propose
i
hear
said
she
in
a
dull
veiled
voice
why
you
know
how
against
this
engagement
i
have
always
been
frank
is
but
and
does
not
know
his
own
mind
as
i
tell
him
besides
he
might
marry
any
one
he
chose
he
has
chosen
me
murmured
maggie
of
course
of
course
but
you
not
think
of
keeping
him
to
it
after
what
has
passed
you
would
not
have
such
a
fine
fellow
as
frank
pointed
at
as
the
of
a
forger
would
you
it
was
far
from
what
i
wished
for
him
before
but
now
why
you
glad
your
father
is
dead
rather
than
he
should
have
lived
to
see
this
day
and
rightly
too
i
think
and
not
go
and
disgrace
frank
from
what
henry
hears
edward
has
been
a
discredit
to
you
in
many
ways
henry
was
at
woodchester
yesterday
and
he
says
if
edward
has
been
fairly
entered
as
an
attorney
his
name
may
be
struck
off
the
rolls
for
many
a
thing
he
has
done
think
of
my
frank
having
his
bright
name
tarnished
by
any
connection
with
such
a
man
henry
says
even
in
a
court
of
law
what
has
come
out
about
edward
would
be
excuse
enough
for
a
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
maggie
lifted
up
her
wan
face
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
were
dilated
her
lips
were
dead
white
she
looked
straight
at
buxton
with
indignant
impatience
henry
henry
what
has
henry
to
do
with
me
buxton
was
staggered
by
the
wild
imperious
look
so
new
upon
her
mild
sweet
face
but
he
was
resolute
for
frank
sake
and
returned
to
the
charge
after
a
moment
pause
henry
is
a
good
friend
of
mine
who
has
my
interest
at
heart
he
has
known
what
a
subject
of
regret
your
engagement
has
been
to
me
though
really
my
repugnance
to
it
was
without
cause
formerly
compared
to
what
it
is
now
now
be
reasonable
my
dear
i
willing
to
do
something
for
you
if
you
will
do
something
for
me
you
must
see
what
a
stop
this
sad
affair
has
put
to
any
thoughts
between
you
and
frank
and
you
must
see
what
cause
i
have
to
wish
to
punish
edward
for
his
ungrateful
behavior
to
say
nothing
of
the
forgery
well
now
i
do
know
what
henry
will
say
to
me
but
i
have
thought
of
this
if
you
write
a
letter
to
frank
just
saying
distinctly
that
for
reasons
which
must
for
ever
remain
a
secret
remain
a
secret
from
frank
said
maggie
again
lifting
up
her
head
why
why
my
dear
you
startle
me
with
that
manner
of
yours
just
let
me
finish
out
my
sentence
if
you
say
that
for
reasons
which
must
forever
remain
a
secret
you
decidedly
and
unchangeably
give
up
all
connection
all
engagement
with
him
which
in
fact
edward
conduct
has
as
good
as
put
an
end
to
i
go
over
to
woodchester
and
tell
henry
and
the
police
that
they
need
not
make
further
search
after
edward
for
that
i
wo
appear
against
him
you
can
save
your
brother
and
you
do
yourself
no
harm
by
writing
this
letter
for
of
course
you
see
your
engagement
is
broken
off
for
you
never
would
wish
to
disgrace
frank
he
paused
anxiously
awaiting
her
reply
she
did
not
speak
i
sure
if
i
appear
against
him
he
is
as
good
as
transported
he
put
in
after
a
while
just
at
this
time
there
was
a
little
sound
of
displaced
china
in
the
closet
buxton
did
not
attend
to
it
but
maggie
heard
it
she
got
up
and
stood
quite
calm
before
buxton
you
must
go
said
she
i
know
you
and
i
know
you
are
not
aware
of
the
cruel
way
in
which
you
have
spoken
to
me
while
asking
me
to
give
up
the
very
hope
and
marrow
of
my
life
she
could
not
go
on
for
a
moment
she
was
choked
up
with
anguish
it
was
the
truth
maggie
said
he
somewhat
abashed
it
was
the
truth
that
made
the
cruelty
of
it
but
you
did
not
mean
to
speak
cruelly
to
me
i
know
only
it
is
hard
all
at
once
to
be
called
upon
to
face
the
shame
and
blasted
character
of
one
who
was
once
an
innocent
child
at
the
same
father
knee
i
may
have
spoken
too
plainly
said
buxton
but
it
was
necessary
to
set
the
plain
truth
before
you
for
my
son
sake
you
will
write
the
letter
i
ask
her
look
was
wandering
and
uncertain
her
attention
was
distracted
by
sounds
which
to
him
had
no
meaning
and
her
judgment
she
felt
was
wavering
and
disturbed
i
can
not
tell
give
me
time
to
think
you
will
do
that
i
sure
go
now
and
leave
me
alone
if
it
is
right
god
will
give
me
strength
to
do
it
and
perhaps
he
will
comfort
me
in
my
desolation
but
i
do
not
know
i
can
not
tell
i
must
have
time
to
think
go
now
if
you
please
sir
said
she
imploringly
i
am
sure
you
will
see
it
is
a
right
thing
i
ask
of
you
he
persisted
go
now
she
repeated
very
well
in
two
hours
i
will
come
back
again
for
your
sake
time
is
precious
even
while
we
speak
he
may
be
arrested
at
eleven
i
will
come
back
he
went
away
leaving
her
sick
and
dizzy
with
the
effort
to
be
calm
and
collected
enough
to
think
she
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
how
near
edward
was
and
started
when
she
saw
the
open
and
his
face
put
out
is
he
gone
i
thought
he
never
would
go
what
a
time
you
kept
him
maggie
i
was
so
afraid
once
you
might
sit
down
to
write
the
letter
in
this
room
and
then
i
knew
he
would
stop
and
worry
you
with
interruptions
and
advice
so
that
it
would
never
be
ended
and
my
back
was
almost
broken
but
you
sent
him
off
famously
why
maggie
maggie
you
not
going
to
faint
surely
his
sudden
burst
out
of
a
whisper
into
a
loud
exclamation
of
surprise
made
her
rally
but
she
could
not
stand
she
tried
to
smile
for
he
really
looked
frightened
i
have
been
sitting
up
for
many
nights
and
now
this
sorrow
her
smile
died
away
into
a
wailing
feeble
cry
well
well
it
over
now
you
see
i
was
frightened
enough
myself
this
morning
i
own
and
then
you
were
brave
and
kind
but
i
knew
you
could
save
me
all
along
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
browne
came
in
why
edward
dear
who
would
have
thought
of
seeing
you
this
is
good
of
you
what
a
pleasant
surprise
i
often
said
you
might
come
over
for
a
day
from
woodchester
what
the
matter
maggie
you
look
so
fagged
losing
all
her
beauty
is
not
she
edward
where
breakfast
i
thought
i
should
find
all
ready
what
the
matter
why
do
you
speak
said
she
growing
anxious
at
their
silence
maggie
left
the
explanation
to
edward
mother
said
he
i
been
rather
a
naughty
boy
and
got
into
some
trouble
but
maggie
is
going
to
help
me
out
of
it
like
a
good
sister
what
is
it
said
browne
looking
bewildered
and
uneasy
oh
i
took
a
little
liberty
with
our
friend
buxton
name
and
wrote
it
down
to
a
receipt
that
was
all
browne
face
showed
that
the
light
came
but
slowly
into
her
mind
but
that
forgery
is
not
it
asked
she
at
length
in
terror
people
call
it
so
said
edward
i
call
it
borrowing
from
an
old
friend
who
was
always
willing
to
lend
does
he
know
is
he
angry
asked
browne
yes
he
knows
and
he
blusters
a
deal
he
was
working
himself
up
grandly
at
first
maggie
i
was
getting
rarely
frightened
i
can
tell
you
has
he
been
here
said
browne
in
bewildered
fright
oh
yes
he
and
maggie
have
been
having
a
long
talk
while
i
was
hid
in
the
i
would
not
go
over
that
again
for
any
money
however
he
and
maggie
came
to
terms
at
last
no
edward
we
did
not
said
maggie
in
a
low
quivering
voice
very
nearly
she
to
give
up
her
engagement
and
then
he
will
let
me
off
do
you
mean
that
maggie
is
to
give
up
her
engagement
to
frank
buxton
asked
his
mother
yes
it
would
never
have
come
to
anything
one
might
see
that
old
buxton
would
have
held
out
against
it
till
doomsday
and
sooner
or
later
frank
would
have
grown
weary
if
maggie
had
had
any
spirit
she
might
have
worked
him
up
to
marry
her
before
now
and
then
i
should
have
been
spared
even
this
fright
for
they
would
never
have
set
the
police
after
frank
buxton
brother
why
dearest
edward
the
police
are
not
after
you
are
they
said
browne
for
the
first
time
alive
to
the
urgency
of
the
case
i
believe
they
are
though
said
edward
but
after
what
buxton
promised
this
morning
it
does
not
signify
he
did
not
promise
anything
said
maggie
edward
turned
sharply
to
her
and
looked
at
her
then
he
went
and
took
hold
of
her
wrists
with
no
gentle
grasp
and
spoke
to
her
through
his
set
teeth
what
do
you
mean
maggie
what
do
you
mean
giving
her
a
little
shake
do
you
mean
that
you
stick
to
your
lover
through
thick
and
thin
and
leave
your
brother
to
be
transported
speak
ca
you
she
looked
up
at
him
and
tried
to
speak
but
no
words
came
out
of
her
dry
throat
at
last
she
made
a
strong
effort
you
must
give
me
time
to
think
i
will
do
what
is
right
by
god
help
as
if
it
was
not
right
and
such
ca
to
save
your
brother
said
he
throwing
her
hands
away
in
a
passionate
manner
i
must
be
alone
said
maggie
rising
and
trying
to
stand
steadily
in
the
reeling
room
she
heard
her
mother
and
edward
speaking
but
their
words
gave
her
no
meaning
and
she
went
out
she
was
leaving
the
house
by
the
when
she
remembered
nancy
left
alone
and
helpless
all
through
this
long
morning
and
ill
as
she
could
endure
detention
from
the
solitude
she
longed
to
seek
she
patiently
fulfilled
her
small
duties
and
sought
out
some
breakfast
for
the
poor
old
woman
when
she
carried
it
up
stairs
nancy
said
there
something
up
you
trouble
in
your
sweet
face
my
darling
never
mind
telling
me
only
do
sob
so
i
pray
for
you
bairn
and
god
will
help
you
thank
you
nancy
do
and
she
left
the
room
chapter
ix
when
she
opened
the
there
was
the
same
small
mizzling
rain
that
had
obscured
the
light
for
weeks
and
now
it
seemed
to
obscure
hope
she
clambered
slowly
for
indeed
she
was
very
feeble
up
the
and
threw
herself
under
the
leafless
thorn
every
small
branch
and
twig
of
which
was
loaded
with
she
did
not
see
the
and
familiar
landscape
for
her
tears
and
did
not
miss
the
hills
in
the
distance
that
were
hidden
behind
the
and
sweeping
showers
browne
and
edward
sat
over
the
fire
he
told
her
his
own
story
making
the
temptation
strong
the
crime
a
mere
trifling
venial
error
which
he
had
been
led
into
through
his
idea
that
he
was
to
become
agent
but
if
it
is
only
that
said
browne
surely
buxton
will
not
think
of
going
to
law
with
you
it
not
merely
going
to
law
that
he
will
think
of
but
trying
and
transporting
me
that
henry
he
has
got
for
his
agent
is
as
sharp
as
a
needle
and
as
hard
as
a
nether
and
the
fellow
has
obtained
such
a
hold
over
buxton
that
he
dare
but
do
what
he
tells
him
i
imagine
how
he
had
so
much
left
as
to
come
with
his
proposal
to
maggie
unless
indeed
henry
knows
of
it
or
what
is
most
likely
of
all
has
put
him
up
to
it
between
them
they
have
given
that
poor
fool
crayston
a
pretty
dose
of
it
and
i
should
have
come
yet
worse
off
if
it
had
not
been
for
maggie
let
me
get
clear
this
time
and
i
will
keep
to
windward
of
the
law
for
the
future
if
we
sold
the
cottage
we
could
repay
it
said
browne
meditating
maggie
and
i
could
live
on
very
little
but
you
see
this
property
is
held
in
trust
for
you
two
nay
mother
you
must
not
talk
of
repaying
it
depend
upon
it
he
will
be
so
glad
to
have
frank
free
from
his
engagement
that
he
wo
think
of
asking
for
the
money
and
if
henry
says
anything
about
it
we
can
tell
him
it
not
half
the
damages
they
would
have
had
to
have
given
maggie
if
frank
had
been
extricated
in
any
other
way
i
wish
she
would
come
back
i
would
prime
her
a
little
as
to
what
to
say
keep
a
look
out
mother
lest
buxton
returns
and
find
me
here
i
wish
maggie
would
come
in
too
said
browne
i
afraid
catch
cold
this
damp
day
and
then
i
shall
have
two
to
nurse
you
think
she
give
it
up
do
you
edward
if
she
does
not
i
afraid
of
harm
coming
to
you
had
you
not
better
keep
out
of
the
way
it
fine
talking
where
am
i
to
go
out
of
sight
of
the
police
this
wet
day
without
a
shilling
in
the
world
too
if
you
give
me
some
money
be
off
fast
enough
and
make
assurance
doubly
sure
i
not
much
afraid
of
maggie
she
a
little
thing
and
i
can
always
bend
her
round
to
what
we
want
she
had
better
take
care
too
said
he
with
a
desperate
look
on
his
face
for
by
g
i
make
her
give
up
all
thoughts
of
frank
rather
than
be
taken
and
tried
why
it
my
chance
for
all
my
life
and
do
you
think
i
have
it
frustrated
for
a
girl
whim
i
think
it
rather
hard
upon
her
too
pleaded
his
mother
she
very
fond
of
him
and
it
would
have
been
such
a
good
match
for
her
pooh
she
not
nineteen
yet
and
has
plenty
of
time
before
her
to
pick
up
somebody
else
while
do
you
see
if
i
caught
and
transported
done
for
life
besides
i
a
notion
frank
had
already
begun
to
be
tired
of
the
affair
it
would
have
been
broken
off
in
a
month
or
two
without
her
gaining
anything
by
it
well
if
you
think
so
replied
browne
but
i
sorry
for
her
i
always
told
her
she
was
foolish
to
think
so
much
about
him
but
i
know
she
fret
a
deal
if
it
given
up
oh
she
soon
comfort
herself
with
thinking
that
she
has
saved
me
i
wish
she
come
it
must
be
near
eleven
i
do
wish
she
would
come
hark
is
not
that
the
said
he
turning
white
and
betaking
himself
once
more
to
the
he
held
it
ajar
till
he
heard
maggie
stepping
softly
and
slowly
across
the
floor
she
opened
the
and
stood
looking
in
with
the
strange
imperceptive
gaze
of
a
then
she
roused
herself
and
saw
that
he
was
not
there
so
she
came
in
a
step
or
two
and
sat
down
in
her
dripping
cloak
on
a
chair
near
the
door
edward
returned
bold
now
there
was
no
danger
maggie
said
he
what
have
you
fixed
to
say
to
mr
burton
she
sighed
deeply
and
then
lifted
up
her
large
innocent
eyes
to
his
face
i
can
not
give
up
frank
said
she
in
a
low
quiet
voice
browne
threw
up
her
hands
and
exclaimed
in
terror
oh
edward
edward
go
away
i
will
give
you
all
the
plate
i
have
you
can
sell
it
my
darling
go
not
till
i
have
brought
maggie
to
reason
said
he
in
a
manner
as
quiet
as
her
own
but
with
a
subdued
ferocity
in
it
which
she
saw
but
which
did
not
intimidate
her
he
went
up
to
her
and
spoke
below
his
breath
maggie
we
were
children
together
we
two
brother
and
sister
of
one
blood
do
you
give
me
up
to
be
put
in
prison
in
the
hulks
among
the
basest
of
criminals
i
do
know
where
all
for
the
sake
of
your
own
selfish
happiness
she
trembled
very
much
but
did
not
speak
or
cry
or
make
any
noise
you
were
always
selfish
you
always
thought
of
yourself
but
this
time
i
did
think
you
would
have
shown
how
different
you
could
be
but
self
self
paramount
above
all
oh
maggie
how
can
you
be
so
and
selfish
echoed
browne
crying
and
sobbing
mother
said
maggie
i
know
that
i
think
too
often
and
too
much
of
myself
but
this
time
i
thought
only
of
frank
he
loves
me
it
would
break
his
heart
if
i
wrote
as
buxton
wishes
cutting
our
lives
asunder
and
giving
no
reason
for
it
he
loves
you
so
said
edward
tauntingly
a
man
love
break
his
heart
you
got
some
pretty
notions
who
told
you
that
he
loved
you
so
desperately
how
do
you
know
it
because
i
love
him
so
said
she
in
a
quiet
earnest
voice
i
do
not
know
of
any
other
reason
but
that
is
quite
sufficient
to
me
i
believe
him
when
he
says
he
loves
me
and
i
have
no
right
to
cause
him
the
infinite
the
terrible
pain
which
my
own
heart
tells
me
he
would
feel
if
i
did
what
buxton
wishes
me
her
manner
was
so
simple
and
utterly
truthful
that
it
was
as
quiet
and
fearless
as
a
child
her
brother
fierce
looks
of
anger
had
no
power
over
her
and
his
blustering
died
away
before
her
into
something
of
the
frightened
cowardliness
he
had
shown
in
the
morning
but
browne
came
up
to
maggie
and
took
her
hand
between
both
of
hers
which
were
trembling
maggie
you
can
save
edward
i
know
i
have
not
loved
you
as
i
should
have
done
but
i
will
love
and
comfort
you
forever
if
you
will
but
write
as
buxton
says
think
perhaps
frank
may
not
take
you
at
your
word
but
may
come
over
and
see
you
and
all
may
be
right
and
yet
edward
may
be
saved
it
is
only
writing
this
letter
you
need
not
stick
to
it
no
said
edward
a
signature
if
you
can
prove
compulsion
is
not
valid
we
will
all
prove
that
you
write
this
letter
under
compulsion
and
if
frank
loves
you
so
desperately
he
wo
give
you
up
without
a
trial
to
make
you
change
your
mind
no
said
maggie
firmly
if
i
write
the
letter
i
abide
by
it
i
will
not
quibble
with
my
conscience
edward
i
will
not
marry
i
will
go
and
live
near
you
and
come
to
you
whenever
i
may
and
give
up
my
life
to
you
if
you
are
sent
to
prison
my
mother
and
i
will
go
if
need
be
i
do
not
know
yet
what
i
can
do
or
can
not
do
for
you
but
all
i
can
i
will
but
this
one
thing
i
can
not
then
i
off
said
edward
on
your
deathbed
may
you
remember
this
hour
and
how
you
denied
your
only
brother
request
may
you
ask
my
forgiveness
with
your
dying
breath
and
may
i
be
there
to
deny
it
you
wait
a
minute
said
maggie
springing
up
rapidly
edward
do
curse
me
with
such
terrible
words
till
all
is
done
mother
i
implore
you
to
keep
him
here
hide
him
do
what
you
can
to
conceal
him
i
will
have
one
more
trial
she
snatched
up
her
bonnet
and
was
gone
before
they
had
time
to
think
or
speak
to
arrest
her
on
she
flew
along
the
combehurst
road
as
she
went
the
tears
fell
like
rain
down
her
face
and
she
talked
to
herself
he
should
not
have
said
so
no
he
should
not
have
said
so
we
were
the
only
two
but
still
she
pressed
on
over
the
thick
wet
brown
heather
she
saw
buxton
coming
and
she
went
still
quicker
the
rain
had
cleared
off
and
a
yellow
watery
gleam
of
sunshine
was
struggling
out
she
stopped
or
he
would
have
passed
her
unheeded
little
expecting
to
meet
her
there
i
wanted
to
see
you
said
she
all
at
once
resuming
her
composure
and
almost
assuming
a
dignified
manner
you
must
not
go
down
to
our
house
we
have
sorrow
enough
there
come
under
these
and
let
me
speak
to
you
i
hope
you
have
thought
of
what
i
said
and
are
willing
to
do
what
i
asked
you
no
said
she
i
have
thought
and
thought
i
did
not
think
in
a
selfish
spirit
though
they
say
i
did
i
prayed
first
i
could
not
do
that
earnestly
and
be
selfish
i
think
i
can
not
give
up
frank
i
know
the
disgrace
and
if
he
knowing
all
thinks
fit
to
give
me
up
i
shall
never
say
a
word
but
bow
my
head
and
try
and
live
out
my
appointed
days
quietly
and
cheerfully
but
he
is
the
judge
not
you
nor
have
i
any
right
to
do
what
you
ask
me
she
stopped
because
the
agitation
took
away
her
breath
he
began
in
a
cold
manner
i
am
very
sorry
the
law
must
take
its
course
i
would
have
saved
my
son
from
the
pain
of
all
this
knowledge
and
that
which
he
will
of
course
feel
in
the
necessity
of
giving
up
his
engagement
i
would
have
refused
to
appear
against
your
brother
shamefully
ungrateful
as
he
has
been
now
you
can
not
wonder
that
i
act
according
to
my
advice
and
prosecute
your
brother
as
if
he
were
a
stranger
he
turned
to
go
away
he
was
so
cold
and
determined
that
for
a
moment
maggie
was
timid
but
she
then
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
buxton
said
she
you
will
not
do
what
you
threaten
i
know
you
better
think
my
father
was
your
old
friend
that
claim
is
perhaps
done
away
with
by
edward
conduct
but
i
do
not
believe
you
can
forget
it
always
if
you
did
fulfill
the
menace
you
uttered
just
now
there
would
come
times
as
you
grew
older
and
life
grew
fainter
and
fainter
before
you
quiet
times
of
thought
when
you
remembered
the
days
of
your
youth
and
the
friends
you
then
had
and
knew
you
would
recollect
that
one
of
them
had
left
an
only
son
who
had
done
wrong
who
had
sinned
sinned
against
you
in
his
weakness
and
you
would
think
then
you
could
not
help
it
how
you
had
forgotten
mercy
in
justice
and
as
justice
required
he
should
be
treated
as
a
felon
you
threw
him
among
felons
where
every
glimmering
of
goodness
was
darkened
for
ever
edward
is
after
all
more
weak
than
wicked
but
he
will
become
wicked
if
you
put
him
in
prison
and
have
him
transported
god
is
merciful
we
can
not
tell
or
think
how
merciful
oh
sir
i
am
so
sure
you
will
be
merciful
and
give
my
brother
my
poor
sinning
brother
a
chance
that
i
will
tell
you
all
i
will
throw
myself
upon
your
pity
edward
is
even
now
at
home
miserable
and
desperate
my
mother
is
too
much
stunned
to
understand
all
our
wretchedness
for
very
wretched
we
are
in
our
shame
as
she
spoke
the
wind
arose
and
shivered
in
the
wiry
leaves
of
the
and
there
was
a
moaning
sound
as
of
some
ariel
imprisoned
in
the
thick
branches
that
tangled
overhead
made
a
shelter
for
them
either
the
noise
or
buxton
fancy
called
up
an
echo
to
maggie
voice
a
pleading
with
her
pleading
a
sad
tone
of
regret
distinct
yet
blending
with
her
speech
and
a
falling
dying
sound
as
her
voice
died
away
in
miserable
suspense
it
might
be
that
formed
as
she
was
by
buxton
care
and
love
her
accents
and
words
were
such
as
that
lady
now
at
rest
from
all
sorrow
would
have
used
somehow
at
any
rate
the
thought
flashed
into
buxton
mind
that
as
maggie
spoke
his
dead
wife
voice
was
heard
imploring
mercy
in
a
clear
distinct
tone
though
faint
as
if
separated
from
him
by
an
infinite
distance
of
space
at
least
this
is
the
account
buxton
would
have
given
of
the
manner
in
which
the
idea
of
his
wife
became
present
to
him
and
what
she
would
have
wished
him
to
do
a
powerful
motive
in
his
conduct
words
of
hers
long
ago
spoken
and
merciful
forgiving
expressions
made
use
of
in
former
days
to
soften
him
in
some
angry
mood
were
clearly
remembered
while
maggie
spoke
and
their
influence
was
perceptible
in
the
change
of
his
tone
and
the
wavering
of
his
manner
henceforward
and
yet
you
will
not
save
frank
from
being
involved
in
your
disgrace
said
he
but
more
as
if
weighing
and
deliberating
on
the
case
than
he
had
ever
spoken
before
if
frank
wishes
it
i
will
quietly
withdraw
myself
out
of
his
sight
forever
i
give
you
my
promise
before
god
to
do
so
i
shall
not
utter
one
word
of
entreaty
or
complaint
i
will
try
not
to
wonder
or
feel
surprise
i
will
bless
him
in
every
action
of
his
future
life
but
think
how
different
would
be
the
disgrace
he
would
voluntarily
incur
to
my
poor
mother
shame
when
she
wakens
up
to
know
what
her
child
has
done
her
very
torper
about
it
now
is
more
painful
than
words
can
tell
what
could
edward
do
asked
buxton
henry
wo
hear
of
my
passing
over
any
frauds
oh
you
relent
said
maggie
taking
his
hand
and
pressing
it
what
could
he
do
he
could
do
the
same
whatever
it
was
as
you
thought
of
his
doing
if
i
had
written
that
terrible
letter
and
you
be
willing
to
give
it
up
if
frank
wishes
when
he
knows
all
asked
buxton
she
crossed
her
hands
and
drooped
her
head
but
answered
steadily
whatever
frank
wishes
when
he
knows
all
i
will
gladly
do
i
will
speak
the
truth
i
do
not
believe
that
any
shame
surrounding
me
and
not
in
me
will
alter
frank
love
one
title
we
shall
see
said
buxton
but
what
i
thought
of
edward
doing
in
case
well
never
mind
seeing
how
she
shrunk
back
from
all
mention
of
the
letter
he
had
asked
her
to
write
was
to
go
to
america
out
of
the
way
then
henry
would
think
he
had
escaped
and
need
never
be
told
of
my
coenivance
i
think
he
would
throw
up
the
agency
if
he
were
and
he
a
very
clever
man
if
ned
is
in
england
henry
will
ferret
him
out
and
besides
this
affair
is
so
blown
i
do
think
he
could
return
to
his
profession
what
do
you
say
to
this
maggie
i
will
tell
my
mother
i
must
ask
her
to
me
it
seems
most
desirable
only
i
fear
he
is
very
ill
and
it
seems
lonely
but
never
mind
we
ought
to
be
thankful
to
you
forever
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
hope
and
trust
he
will
live
to
show
you
what
your
goodness
has
made
him
but
you
must
lose
no
time
if
henry
traces
him
i
ca
answer
for
myself
i
shall
have
no
good
reason
to
give
as
i
should
have
had
if
i
could
have
told
him
that
frank
and
you
were
to
be
as
strangers
to
each
other
and
even
then
i
should
have
been
afraid
he
is
such
a
determined
fellow
but
uncommonly
clever
stay
said
he
yielding
to
a
sudden
and
inexplicable
desire
to
see
edward
and
discover
if
his
criminality
had
in
any
way
changed
his
outward
appearance
i
go
with
you
i
can
hasten
things
if
edward
goes
he
must
be
off
as
soon
as
possible
to
liverpool
and
leave
no
trace
the
next
packet
sails
the
day
after
i
noted
it
down
from
the
maggie
and
he
sped
along
the
road
he
spoke
his
thoughts
aloud
i
wonder
if
he
will
be
grateful
to
me
for
this
not
that
i
ever
mean
to
look
for
gratitude
again
i
mean
to
try
not
to
care
for
anybody
but
frank
men
by
outward
force
says
henry
he
is
an
uncommonly
clever
man
and
he
says
the
longer
he
lives
the
more
he
is
convinced
of
the
badness
of
men
he
always
looks
for
it
now
even
in
those
who
are
the
best
apparently
maggie
was
too
anxious
to
answer
or
even
to
attend
to
him
at
the
top
of
the
slope
she
asked
him
to
wait
while
she
ran
down
and
told
the
result
of
her
conversation
with
him
her
mother
was
alone
looking
white
and
sick
she
told
her
that
edward
had
gone
into
the
above
the
old
disused
shippon
maggie
related
the
substance
of
her
interview
with
buxton
and
his
wish
that
edward
should
go
to
america
to
america
said
browne
why
that
as
far
as
botany
bay
it
just
like
transporting
him
i
thought
you
done
something
for
us
you
looked
so
glad
dearest
mother
it
something
he
is
not
to
be
subjected
to
imprisonment
or
trial
i
must
go
and
tell
him
only
i
must
beckon
to
buxton
first
but
when
he
comes
do
show
him
how
thankful
we
are
for
his
mercy
to
edward
browne
murmurings
whatever
was
their
meaning
were
lost
upon
maggie
she
ran
through
the
court
and
up
the
slope
with
the
lightness
of
a
lawn
for
though
she
was
tired
in
body
to
an
excess
she
had
never
been
before
in
her
life
the
opening
beam
of
hope
in
the
dark
sky
made
her
spirit
conquer
her
flesh
for
the
time
she
did
not
stop
to
speak
but
turned
again
as
soon
as
she
had
signed
to
buxton
to
follow
her
she
left
the
open
for
his
entrance
and
passed
out
again
through
the
kitchen
into
the
space
behind
which
was
partly
an
uninclosed
yard
and
partly
rocky
common
she
ran
across
the
little
green
to
the
shippon
and
mounted
the
ladder
into
the
loft
up
in
a
dark
corner
edward
stood
with
an
old
rake
in
his
hand
i
thought
it
was
you
maggie
said
he
heaving
a
deep
breath
of
relief
what
have
you
done
have
you
agreed
to
write
the
letter
you
done
something
for
me
i
see
by
your
looks
yes
i
have
told
buxton
all
he
is
waiting
for
you
in
the
parlor
oh
i
knew
he
could
not
be
so
hard
she
was
out
of
breath
i
do
understand
you
said
he
you
never
been
such
a
fool
as
to
go
and
tell
him
where
i
am
yes
i
have
i
felt
i
might
trust
him
he
has
promised
not
to
prosecute
you
the
worst
is
he
says
you
must
go
to
america
but
come
down
ned
and
speak
to
him
you
owe
him
thanks
and
he
wants
to
see
you
i
ca
go
through
a
scene
i
not
up
to
it
besides
are
you
sure
he
is
not
entrapping
me
to
the
police
if
i
had
a
farthing
of
money
i
would
not
trust
him
but
be
off
to
the
moors
oh
edward
how
do
you
think
he
would
do
anything
so
treacherous
and
mean
i
beg
you
not
to
lose
time
in
distrust
he
says
himself
if
henry
comes
before
you
are
off
he
does
not
know
what
will
be
the
consequence
the
packet
sails
for
america
in
two
days
it
is
sad
for
you
to
have
to
go
perhaps
even
yet
he
may
think
of
something
better
though
i
do
know
how
we
can
ask
or
expect
it
i
do
want
anything
better
replied
he
than
that
i
should
have
money
enough
to
carry
me
to
america
i
in
more
scrapes
than
this
though
none
so
bad
in
england
and
in
america
there
many
an
opening
to
fortune
he
followed
her
down
the
steps
while
he
spoke
once
in
the
yellow
light
of
the
watery
day
she
was
struck
by
his
ghastly
look
sharp
lines
of
suspicion
and
cunning
seemed
to
have
been
stamped
upon
his
face
making
it
look
older
by
many
years
than
his
age
warranted
his
jaunty
evening
dress
all
and
dirty
added
to
his
forlorn
and
disreputable
appearance
but
most
of
all
deepest
of
all
was
the
impression
she
received
that
he
was
not
long
for
this
world
and
oh
how
unfit
for
the
next
still
if
time
was
given
if
he
were
placed
far
away
from
temptation
she
thought
that
her
father
son
might
yet
repent
and
be
saved
she
took
his
hand
for
he
was
hanging
back
as
they
came
near
the
and
led
him
in
she
looked
like
some
guardian
angel
with
her
face
that
beamed
out
trust
and
hope
and
thankfulness
he
on
the
contrary
hung
his
head
in
angry
awkward
shame
and
half
wished
he
had
trusted
to
his
own
wits
and
tried
to
evade
the
police
rather
than
have
been
forced
into
this
interview
his
mother
came
to
him
for
she
loved
him
all
the
more
fondly
now
he
seemed
degraded
and
friendless
she
could
not
or
would
not
comprehend
the
extent
of
his
guilt
and
had
upbraided
buxton
to
the
top
of
her
bent
for
thinking
of
sending
him
away
to
america
there
was
a
silence
when
he
came
in
which
was
insupportable
to
him
he
looked
up
with
clouded
eyes
that
dared
not
meet
buxton
i
am
here
sir
to
learn
what
you
wish
me
to
do
maggie
says
i
am
to
go
to
america
if
that
is
where
you
want
to
send
me
i
ready
buxton
wished
himself
away
as
heartily
as
edward
upbraidings
just
when
he
felt
that
he
had
done
a
kind
action
and
yielded
against
his
judgment
to
maggie
entreaties
had
made
him
think
himself
very
ill
used
and
now
here
was
edward
speaking
in
a
sullen
savage
kind
of
way
instead
of
showing
any
gratitude
the
idea
of
henry
stern
displeasure
loomed
in
the
background
yes
said
he
i
glad
to
find
you
come
into
the
idea
of
going
to
america
it
the
only
place
for
you
the
sooner
you
can
go
and
the
better
i
ca
go
without
money
said
edward
doggedly
if
i
had
had
money
i
need
not
have
come
here
oh
ned
would
you
have
gone
without
seeing
me
said
browne
bursting
into
tears
buxton
i
can
not
let
him
go
to
america
look
how
ill
he
is
he
die
if
you
send
him
there
mother
do
give
way
so
said
edward
kindly
taking
her
hand
not
ill
at
least
not
to
signify
buxton
is
right
america
is
the
only
place
for
me
to
tell
the
truth
even
if
buxton
is
good
enough
he
said
this
as
if
unwilling
to
express
any
word
of
thankfulness
not
to
prosecute
me
there
are
others
who
may
and
will
i
safer
out
of
the
country
give
me
money
enough
to
get
to
liverpool
and
pay
my
passage
and
i
be
off
this
minute
you
shall
not
said
browne
holding
him
tightly
you
told
me
this
morning
you
were
led
into
temptation
and
went
wrong
because
you
had
no
comfortable
home
nor
any
one
to
care
for
you
and
make
you
happy
it
will
be
worse
in
america
you
get
wrong
again
and
be
away
from
all
who
can
help
you
or
you
die
all
by
yourself
in
some
backwood
or
other
maggie
you
might
speak
and
help
me
how
can
you
stand
so
still
and
let
him
go
to
america
without
a
word
maggie
looked
up
bright
and
steadfast
as
if
she
saw
something
beyond
the
material
present
here
was
the
opportunity
for
of
which
buxton
had
spoken
to
her
in
her
childish
days
the
time
which
comes
to
all
but
comes
unheeded
and
unseen
to
those
whose
eyes
are
not
trained
to
watching
mother
could
you
do
without
me
for
a
time
if
you
could
and
it
would
make
you
easier
and
help
edward
to
the
word
on
her
lips
died
away
for
it
seemed
to
imply
a
reproach
on
one
who
stood
in
his
shame
among
them
all
you
would
go
said
browne
catching
at
the
unfinished
sentence
oh
maggie
that
the
best
thing
you
ever
said
or
done
since
you
were
born
edward
would
not
you
like
to
have
maggie
with
you
yes
said
he
well
enough
it
would
be
far
better
for
me
than
going
all
alone
though
i
dare
say
i
could
make
my
way
pretty
well
after
a
time
if
she
went
she
might
stay
till
i
felt
settled
and
had
made
some
friends
and
then
she
could
come
back
buxton
was
astonished
at
first
by
this
proposal
of
maggie
he
could
not
all
at
once
understand
the
difference
between
what
she
now
offered
to
do
and
what
he
had
urged
upon
her
only
this
very
morning
but
as
he
thought
about
it
he
perceived
that
what
was
her
own
she
was
willing
to
sacrifice
but
that
frank
heart
once
given
into
her
faithful
keeping
she
was
answerable
for
it
to
him
and
to
god
this
light
came
down
upon
him
slowly
but
when
he
understood
he
admired
with
almost
a
wondering
admiration
that
little
timid
girl
brave
enough
to
cross
the
ocean
and
go
to
a
foreign
land
if
she
could
only
help
to
save
her
brother
i
sure
maggie
said
he
turning
towards
her
you
are
a
good
thoughtful
little
creature
it
may
be
the
saving
of
edward
i
believe
it
will
i
think
god
will
bless
you
for
being
so
devoted
the
expense
will
be
doubled
said
edward
my
dear
boy
never
mind
the
money
i
can
get
it
advanced
upon
this
cottage
as
for
that
i
advance
it
said
buxton
could
we
not
said
maggie
hesitating
from
her
want
of
knowledge
make
over
the
furniture
papa
books
and
what
little
plate
we
have
to
buxton
something
like
pawning
them
if
he
would
advance
the
requisite
money
he
strange
as
it
may
seem
is
the
only
person
you
can
ask
in
this
great
strait
and
so
it
was
arranged
after
some
demur
on
buxton
part
but
maggie
kept
steadily
to
her
point
as
soon
as
she
found
that
it
was
attainable
and
browne
was
equally
inflexible
though
from
a
different
feeling
she
regarded
buxton
as
the
cause
of
her
son
banishment
and
refused
to
accept
of
any
favor
from
him
if
there
had
been
time
indeed
she
would
have
preferred
obtaining
the
money
in
the
same
manner
from
any
one
else
edward
brightened
up
a
little
when
he
heard
the
sum
could
be
procured
he
was
almost
indifferent
how
and
strangely
callous
as
maggie
thought
he
even
proposed
to
draw
up
a
legal
form
of
assignment
buxton
only
thought
of
hurrying
on
the
departure
but
he
could
not
refrain
from
expressing
his
approval
and
admiration
of
maggie
whenever
he
came
near
her
before
he
went
he
called
her
aside
my
dear
i
not
sure
if
frank
can
do
better
than
marry
you
after
all
mind
i
not
given
it
as
much
thought
as
i
should
like
but
if
you
come
back
as
we
plan
next
autumn
and
he
is
steady
to
you
till
then
and
edward
is
going
on
well
if
he
can
but
keep
good
he
do
for
he
is
very
sharp
yon
is
a
knowing
paper
he
drew
up
why
i
think
about
it
only
let
frank
see
a
bit
of
the
world
first
i
rather
you
did
not
tell
him
i
any
thoughts
of
coming
round
that
he
may
have
a
fair
trial
and
keep
it
from
erminia
if
i
can
or
she
will
let
it
all
out
to
him
i
shall
see
you
at
the
coach
god
bless
you
my
girl
and
keep
you
on
the
great
wide
sea
he
was
absolutely
in
tears
when
he
went
away
tears
of
admiring
regret
over
maggie
chapter
x
the
more
maggie
thought
the
more
she
felt
sure
that
the
impulse
on
which
she
had
acted
in
proposing
to
go
with
her
brother
was
right
she
feared
there
was
little
hope
for
his
character
whatever
there
might
be
for
his
worldly
fortune
if
he
were
thrown
in
the
condition
of
mind
in
which
he
was
now
among
the
set
of
adventurous
men
who
are
continually
going
over
to
america
in
search
of
an
el
dorado
to
be
discovered
by
their
wits
she
knew
she
had
but
little
influence
over
him
at
present
but
she
would
not
doubt
or
waver
in
her
hope
that
patience
and
love
might
work
him
right
at
last
she
meant
to
get
some
employment
in
teaching
in
needlework
in
a
shop
no
matter
how
humble
and
be
no
burden
to
him
and
make
him
a
happy
home
from
which
he
should
feel
no
wish
to
wander
her
chief
anxiety
was
about
her
mother
she
did
not
dwell
more
than
she
could
help
on
her
long
absence
from
frank
it
was
too
sad
and
yet
too
necessary
she
meant
to
write
and
tell
him
all
about
herself
and
edward
the
only
thing
which
she
would
keep
for
some
happy
future
should
be
the
possible
revelation
of
the
proposal
which
buxton
had
made
that
she
should
give
up
her
engagement
as
a
condition
of
his
not
prosecuting
edward
there
was
much
sorrowful
bustle
in
the
moorland
cottage
that
day
erminia
brought
up
a
portion
of
the
money
buxton
was
to
advance
with
an
entreaty
that
edward
would
not
show
himself
out
of
his
home
and
an
account
of
a
letter
from
henry
stating
that
the
woodchester
police
believed
him
to
be
in
london
and
that
search
was
being
made
for
him
there
erminia
looked
very
grave
and
pale
she
gave
her
message
to
browne
speaking
little
beyond
what
was
absolutely
necessary
then
she
took
maggie
aside
and
suddenly
burst
into
tears
maggie
darling
what
is
this
going
to
america
you
always
and
always
been
sacrificing
yourself
to
your
family
and
now
you
setting
off
nobody
knows
where
in
some
vain
hope
of
reforming
edward
i
wish
he
was
not
your
brother
that
i
might
speak
of
him
as
i
should
like
he
has
been
doing
what
is
very
wrong
said
maggie
but
you
none
of
you
know
his
good
points
nor
how
he
has
been
exposed
to
all
sorts
of
bad
influences
i
am
sure
and
never
had
the
advantage
of
a
father
training
and
friendship
which
are
so
inestimable
to
a
son
o
minnie
when
i
remember
how
we
two
used
to
kneel
down
in
the
evenings
at
my
father
knee
and
say
our
prayers
and
then
listen
in
silence
to
his
earnest
blessing
which
grew
more
like
a
prayer
for
us
as
his
life
waned
away
i
would
do
anything
for
edward
rather
than
that
wrestling
agony
of
supplication
should
have
been
in
vain
i
think
of
him
as
the
little
innocent
boy
whose
arm
was
round
me
as
if
to
support
me
in
the
awful
presence
whose
true
name
of
love
we
had
not
learned
minnie
he
has
had
no
proper
training
no
training
i
mean
to
enable
him
to
resist
temptation
and
he
has
been
thrown
into
it
without
warning
or
advice
now
he
knows
what
it
is
and
i
must
try
though
i
am
but
an
unknowing
girl
to
warn
and
to
strengthen
him
do
weaken
my
faith
who
can
do
right
if
we
lose
faith
in
them
and
frank
said
erminia
after
a
pause
poor
frank
dear
frank
replied
maggie
looking
up
and
trying
to
smile
but
in
spite
of
herself
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
if
i
could
have
asked
him
i
know
he
would
approve
of
what
i
am
going
to
do
he
would
feel
it
to
be
right
that
i
should
make
every
effort
i
do
mean
said
she
as
the
tears
would
fall
down
her
cheeks
in
spite
of
her
quivering
effort
at
a
smile
that
i
should
not
have
liked
to
have
seen
him
but
it
is
no
use
talking
of
what
one
would
have
liked
i
am
writing
a
long
letter
to
him
at
every
pause
of
leisure
and
i
keeping
you
all
this
time
said
erminia
getting
up
yet
loth
to
go
when
do
you
intend
to
come
back
let
us
feel
there
is
a
fixed
time
america
why
it
thousands
of
miles
away
oh
maggie
maggie
i
shall
come
back
the
next
autumn
i
trust
said
maggie
comforting
her
friend
with
many
a
soft
caress
edward
will
be
settled
then
i
hope
you
were
longer
in
france
minnie
frank
was
longer
away
that
time
he
wintered
in
italy
with
mr
monro
erminia
went
slowly
to
the
door
then
she
turned
right
facing
maggie
maggie
tell
the
truth
has
my
uncle
been
urging
you
to
go
because
if
he
has
do
trust
him
it
is
only
to
break
off
your
engagement
no
he
has
not
indeed
it
was
my
own
thought
at
first
then
in
a
moment
i
saw
the
relief
it
was
to
my
mother
my
poor
mother
erminia
the
thought
of
her
grief
at
edward
absence
is
the
trial
for
my
sake
you
will
come
often
and
often
and
comfort
her
in
every
way
you
can
yes
that
i
will
tell
me
everything
i
can
do
for
you
kissing
each
other
with
long
lingering
delay
they
parted
nancy
would
be
informed
of
the
cause
of
the
commotion
in
the
house
and
when
she
had
in
some
degree
ascertained
its
nature
she
wasted
no
time
in
asking
further
questions
but
quietly
got
up
and
dressed
herself
and
appeared
among
them
weak
and
trembling
indeed
but
so
calm
and
thoughtful
that
her
presence
was
an
infinite
help
to
maggie
when
day
closed
in
edward
stole
down
to
the
house
once
more
he
was
haggard
enough
to
have
been
in
anxiety
and
concealment
for
a
month
but
when
his
body
was
refreshed
his
spirits
rose
in
a
way
inconceivable
to
maggie
the
spaniards
who
went
out
with
pizarro
were
not
lured
on
by
more
fantastic
notions
of
the
wealth
to
be
acquired
in
the
new
world
than
he
was
he
dwelt
on
these
visions
in
so
brisk
and
vivid
a
manner
that
he
even
made
his
mother
cease
her
weary
weeping
which
had
lasted
the
livelong
day
despite
all
maggie
efforts
to
look
up
and
listen
to
him
i
answer
for
it
said
he
before
long
i
be
an
american
judge
with
miles
of
cotton
plantations
but
in
america
sighed
out
his
mother
never
mind
mother
said
he
with
a
tenderness
which
made
maggie
heart
glad
if
you
wo
come
over
to
america
to
me
why
i
sell
them
all
and
come
back
to
live
in
england
people
will
forget
the
scrapes
that
the
rich
american
got
into
in
his
youth
you
can
pay
back
buxton
then
said
his
mother
oh
yes
of
course
replied
he
as
if
falling
into
a
new
and
trivial
idea
thus
the
evening
whiled
away
the
mother
and
son
sat
hand
in
hand
before
the
little
glinting
blazing
parlor
fire
with
the
unlighted
candles
on
the
table
behind
maggie
busy
in
preparations
passed
softly
in
and
out
and
when
all
was
done
that
could
be
done
before
going
to
liverpool
where
she
hoped
to
have
two
days
to
prepare
their
outfit
more
completely
she
stole
back
to
her
mother
side
but
her
thoughts
would
wander
off
to
frank
working
his
way
south
through
all
the
as
he
had
written
her
word
if
she
had
not
urged
his
absence
he
would
have
been
here
for
her
to
see
his
noble
face
once
more
but
then
perhaps
she
might
never
have
had
the
strength
to
go
late
late
in
the
night
they
separated
maggie
could
not
rest
and
stole
into
her
mother
room
browne
had
cried
herself
to
sleep
like
a
child
maggie
stood
and
looked
at
her
face
and
then
knelt
down
by
the
bed
and
prayed
when
she
arose
she
saw
that
her
mother
was
awake
and
had
been
looking
at
her
maggie
dear
you
a
good
girl
and
i
think
god
will
hear
your
prayer
whatever
it
was
for
i
can
not
tell
you
what
a
relief
it
is
to
me
to
think
you
going
with
him
it
would
have
broken
my
heart
else
if
sometimes
not
been
as
kind
as
i
might
have
been
i
ask
your
forgiveness
now
my
dear
and
i
bless
you
and
thank
you
for
going
out
with
him
for
sure
he
not
well
and
strong
and
will
need
somebody
to
take
care
of
him
and
you
sha
lose
with
frank
for
as
sure
as
i
see
him
i
tell
him
what
a
good
daughter
and
sister
you
been
and
i
shall
say
for
all
he
is
so
rich
i
think
he
may
look
long
before
he
finds
a
wife
for
him
like
our
maggie
i
do
wish
ned
had
got
that
new
greatcoat
he
says
he
left
behind
him
at
woodchester
her
mind
reverted
to
her
darling
son
but
maggie
took
her
short
slumber
by
her
mother
side
with
her
mother
arms
around
her
and
awoke
and
felt
that
her
sleep
had
been
blessed
at
the
the
next
morning
they
met
buxton
all
ready
as
if
for
a
journey
but
glancing
about
him
as
if
in
fear
of
some
coming
enemy
i
going
with
you
to
liverpool
said
he
do
make
any
ado
about
it
please
i
shall
like
to
see
you
off
and
i
may
be
of
some
use
to
you
and
erminia
begged
it
of
me
and
besides
it
will
keep
me
out
of
way
for
a
little
time
and
i
afraid
he
will
find
it
all
out
and
think
me
very
weak
but
you
see
he
made
me
too
hard
upon
crayston
so
i
may
take
it
out
in
a
little
toward
the
son
of
an
old
friend
just
at
this
moment
erminia
came
running
through
the
white
morning
mist
all
glowing
with
haste
maggie
said
she
i
come
to
take
care
of
your
mother
my
uncle
says
she
and
nancy
must
come
to
us
for
a
long
long
visit
or
if
she
would
rather
go
home
i
go
with
her
till
she
feels
able
to
come
to
us
and
do
anything
i
can
think
of
for
her
i
will
try
to
be
a
daughter
till
you
come
back
maggie
only
do
be
long
or
frank
and
i
shall
break
our
hearts
maggie
waited
till
her
mother
had
ended
her
long
clasping
embrace
of
edward
who
was
subdued
enough
this
morning
and
then
with
something
like
esau
craving
for
a
blessing
she
came
to
bid
her
mother
and
received
the
warm
caress
she
had
longed
for
for
years
in
another
moment
the
coach
was
away
and
before
half
an
hour
had
elapsed
combehurst
had
been
lost
in
a
turn
of
the
road
edward
and
buxton
did
not
speak
to
each
other
and
maggie
was
nearly
silent
they
reached
liverpool
in
the
afternoon
and
buxton
who
had
been
there
once
or
twice
before
took
them
directly
to
some
quiet
hotel
he
was
far
more
anxious
that
edward
should
not
expose
himself
to
any
chance
of
recognition
than
edward
himself
he
went
down
to
the
docks
to
secure
berths
in
the
vessel
about
to
sail
the
next
day
and
on
his
return
he
took
maggie
out
to
make
the
requisite
purchases
did
you
pay
for
us
sir
said
maggie
anxious
to
ascertain
the
amount
of
money
she
had
left
after
defraying
the
passage
yes
replied
he
rather
confused
erminia
begged
me
not
to
tell
you
about
it
but
i
ca
manage
a
secret
well
you
see
she
did
not
like
the
idea
of
your
going
as
as
you
meant
to
do
and
she
desired
me
to
take
you
cabin
places
for
her
it
is
no
doing
of
mine
my
dear
i
did
not
think
of
it
but
now
i
have
seen
how
crowded
the
steerage
is
i
am
very
glad
erminia
had
so
much
thought
edward
might
have
roughed
it
well
enough
there
but
it
would
never
have
done
for
you
it
was
very
kind
of
erminia
said
maggie
touched
at
this
consideration
of
her
friend
but
now
do
about
it
interrupted
he
erminia
is
very
rich
and
has
more
money
than
she
knows
what
to
do
with
i
only
vexed
i
did
not
think
of
if
myself
for
maggie
though
i
may
have
my
own
ways
of
thinking
on
some
points
i
ca
be
blind
to
your
goodness
all
evening
buxton
was
busy
and
busy
on
their
behalf
even
edward
when
he
saw
the
attention
that
was
being
paid
to
his
physical
comfort
felt
a
kind
of
penitence
and
after
choking
once
or
twice
in
the
attempt
conquered
his
pride
such
i
call
it
for
want
of
a
better
word
so
far
as
to
express
some
regret
for
his
past
conduct
and
some
gratitude
for
buxton
present
kindness
he
did
it
awkwardly
enough
but
it
pleased
buxton
well
well
that
all
very
right
said
he
reddening
from
his
own
uncomfortableness
of
feeling
now
do
say
any
more
about
it
but
do
your
best
in
america
do
let
me
feel
i
been
a
fool
in
letting
you
off
i
know
henry
will
think
me
so
and
above
all
take
care
of
maggie
mind
what
she
says
and
you
sure
to
go
right
he
asked
them
to
go
on
board
early
the
next
day
as
he
had
promised
erminia
to
see
them
there
and
yet
wished
to
return
as
soon
as
he
could
it
was
evident
that
he
hoped
by
making
his
absence
as
short
as
possible
to
prevent
henry
ever
knowing
that
he
had
left
home
or
in
any
way
connived
at
edward
escape
so
although
the
vessel
was
not
to
sail
till
the
afternoon
tide
they
left
the
hotel
soon
after
breakfast
and
went
to
the
they
were
among
the
first
passengers
on
board
buxton
took
maggie
down
to
her
cabin
she
then
saw
the
reason
of
his
business
the
evening
before
every
store
that
could
be
provided
was
there
a
number
of
books
lay
on
the
little
table
books
just
suited
to
maggie
taste
there
said
he
rubbing
his
hands
do
thank
me
it
all
erminia
doing
she
gave
me
the
list
of
books
i
not
got
all
but
i
think
they
be
enough
just
write
me
one
line
maggie
to
say
i
done
my
best
maggie
wrote
with
tears
in
her
eyes
tears
of
love
toward
the
generous
erminia
a
few
minutes
more
and
buxton
was
gone
maggie
watched
him
as
long
as
she
could
see
him
and
as
his
portly
figure
disappeared
among
the
crowd
on
the
pier
her
heart
sank
within
her
edward
on
the
contrary
rose
at
his
absence
the
only
one
cognisant
of
his
shame
and
was
gone
a
new
life
lay
before
him
the
opening
of
which
was
made
agreeable
to
him
by
the
position
in
which
he
found
himself
placed
as
a
with
many
comforts
provided
for
him
for
although
maggie
wants
had
been
the
principal
object
of
attention
edward
was
not
forgotten
he
was
soon
among
the
sailors
talking
away
in
a
rather
consequential
manner
he
grew
acquainted
with
the
remainder
of
the
at
least
those
who
arrived
before
the
final
bustle
began
and
kept
bringing
his
sister
such
little
pieces
of
news
as
he
could
collect
maggie
they
say
we
are
likely
to
have
a
good
start
and
a
fine
moonlight
night
away
again
he
went
i
say
maggie
that
an
uncommonly
pretty
girl
come
on
board
with
those
old
people
in
black
gone
down
into
the
cabin
now
i
wish
you
would
scrape
up
an
acquaintance
with
her
and
give
me
a
chance
chapter
xi
maggie
sat
on
deck
wrapped
in
her
the
old
familiar
cloak
which
had
been
her
wrap
in
many
a
happy
walk
in
the
haunts
near
her
moorland
home
the
weather
was
not
cold
for
the
time
of
year
but
still
it
was
chilly
to
any
one
that
was
stationary
but
she
wanted
to
look
her
last
on
the
shoals
of
english
people
who
crowded
backward
and
forward
like
ants
on
the
pier
happy
people
who
might
stay
among
their
loved
ones
the
mocking
demons
gathered
round
her
as
they
gather
round
all
who
sacrifice
self
tempting
a
crowd
of
suggestive
doubts
pressed
upon
her
was
it
really
necessary
that
she
should
go
with
edward
could
she
do
him
any
real
good
would
he
be
in
any
way
influenced
by
her
then
the
demon
tried
another
description
of
doubt
had
it
ever
been
her
duty
to
go
she
was
leaving
her
mother
alone
she
was
giving
frank
much
present
sorrow
it
was
not
even
yet
too
late
she
could
not
endure
longer
and
replied
to
her
own
tempting
heart
i
was
right
to
hope
for
edward
i
am
right
to
give
him
the
chance
of
steadiness
which
my
presence
will
give
i
am
doing
what
my
mother
earnestly
wished
me
to
do
and
what
to
the
last
she
felt
relieved
by
my
doing
i
know
frank
will
feel
sorrow
because
i
myself
have
such
an
aching
heart
but
if
i
had
asked
him
whether
i
was
not
right
in
going
he
would
have
been
too
truthful
not
to
have
said
yes
i
have
tried
to
do
right
and
though
i
may
fail
and
evil
may
seem
to
arise
rather
than
good
out
of
my
endeavor
yet
still
i
will
submit
to
my
failure
and
try
and
say
will
be
done
if
only
i
might
have
seen
frank
once
more
and
told
him
all
face
to
face
to
do
away
with
such
thoughts
she
determined
no
longer
to
sit
gazing
and
tempted
by
the
shore
and
giving
one
look
to
the
land
which
contained
her
lover
she
went
down
below
and
busied
herself
even
through
her
blinding
tears
in
trying
to
arrange
her
own
cabin
and
edward
she
heard
boat
after
boat
arrive
loaded
with
passengers
she
learnt
from
edward
who
came
down
to
tell
her
the
fact
that
there
were
upwards
of
two
hundred
steerage
passengers
she
felt
the
tremulous
shake
which
announced
that
the
ship
was
loosed
from
her
moorings
and
being
tugged
down
the
river
she
wrapped
herself
up
once
more
and
came
on
deck
and
sat
down
among
the
many
who
were
looking
their
last
look
at
england
the
early
winter
evening
was
darkening
in
and
shutting
out
the
welsh
coast
the
hills
of
which
were
like
the
hills
of
home
she
was
thankful
when
she
became
too
ill
to
think
and
remember
exhausted
and
still
she
did
not
know
whether
she
was
sleeping
or
waking
or
whether
she
had
slept
since
she
had
thrown
herself
down
on
her
cot
when
suddenly
there
was
a
great
rush
and
then
edward
stood
like
lightning
by
her
pulling
her
up
by
the
arm
the
ship
is
on
fire
to
the
deck
maggie
fire
fire
he
shouted
like
a
maniac
while
he
dragged
her
up
the
stairs
as
if
the
cry
of
fire
could
summon
human
aid
on
the
great
deep
and
the
cry
was
echoed
up
to
heaven
by
all
that
crowd
in
an
accent
of
despair
they
stood
huddled
together
dressed
and
undressed
now
in
red
lurid
light
showing
ghastly
faces
of
terror
now
in
white
wreaths
of
smoke
as
far
away
from
the
steerage
as
they
could
press
for
there
up
from
the
hold
rose
columns
of
smoke
and
now
and
then
a
fierce
blaze
leaped
out
exulting
higher
and
higher
every
time
while
from
each
crevice
on
that
part
of
the
deck
issued
harbingers
of
the
terrible
destruction
that
awaited
them
the
sailors
were
lowering
the
boats
and
above
them
stood
the
captain
as
calm
as
if
he
were
on
his
own
hearth
at
home
his
home
where
he
never
more
should
be
his
voice
was
low
was
lower
but
as
clear
as
a
bell
in
its
distinctness
as
wise
in
its
directions
as
collected
thought
could
make
it
some
of
the
steerage
passengers
were
helping
but
more
were
dumb
and
motionless
with
affright
in
that
dead
silence
was
heard
a
low
wail
of
sorrow
as
of
numbers
whose
power
was
crushed
out
of
them
by
that
awful
terror
edward
still
held
his
clutch
of
margaret
arm
be
ready
said
he
in
a
fierce
whisper
the
fire
sprung
up
along
the
and
did
not
sink
or
disappear
again
they
knew
then
that
all
the
mad
efforts
made
by
some
few
below
to
extinguish
it
were
in
vain
and
then
went
up
the
prayers
of
hundreds
in
mortal
agony
of
fear
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
not
in
quiet
calm
of
village
church
did
ever
such
a
pitiful
cry
go
up
to
heaven
it
was
like
one
voice
like
the
day
of
judgment
in
the
presence
of
the
lord
and
after
that
there
was
no
more
silence
but
a
confusion
of
terrible
farewells
and
wild
cries
of
affright
and
purposeless
rushes
hither
and
thither
the
boats
were
down
rocking
on
the
sea
the
captain
spoke
put
the
children
in
first
they
are
the
most
helpless
one
or
two
stout
sailors
stood
in
the
boats
to
receive
them
edward
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
gangway
pulling
maggie
with
him
she
was
almost
pressed
to
death
and
stifled
close
in
her
ear
she
heard
a
woman
praying
to
herself
she
poor
creature
knew
of
no
presence
but
god
in
that
awful
hour
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
to
him
my
heart
darlings
are
taken
away
from
me
faith
faith
oh
my
great
god
i
will
die
in
peace
if
thou
wilt
but
grant
me
faith
in
this
terrible
hour
to
feel
that
thou
wilt
take
care
of
my
poor
orphans
hush
dearest
billy
she
cried
out
shrill
to
a
little
fellow
in
the
boat
waiting
for
his
mother
and
the
change
in
her
voice
from
despair
to
a
kind
of
cheerfulness
showed
what
a
mother
love
can
do
mother
will
come
soon
hide
his
face
anne
and
wrap
your
shawl
tight
round
him
and
then
her
voice
sank
down
again
in
the
same
low
wild
prayer
for
faith
maggie
could
not
turn
to
see
her
face
but
took
the
hand
which
hung
near
her
the
woman
clutched
at
it
with
the
grasp
of
a
vice
but
went
on
praying
as
if
unconscious
just
then
the
crowd
gave
way
a
little
the
captain
had
said
that
the
women
were
to
go
next
but
they
were
too
frenzied
to
obey
his
directions
and
now
pressed
backward
and
forward
the
sailors
with
mute
stern
obedience
strove
to
follow
out
the
captain
directions
edward
pulled
maggie
and
she
kept
her
hold
on
the
mother
the
mate
at
the
head
of
the
gangway
pushed
him
back
only
women
are
to
go
there
are
men
there
three
to
manage
the
boat
come
on
maggie
while
there
room
for
us
said
he
unheeding
but
maggie
drew
back
and
put
the
mother
hand
into
the
mate
save
her
first
said
she
the
woman
did
not
know
of
anything
but
that
her
children
were
there
it
was
only
in
after
days
and
quiet
hours
that
she
remembered
the
young
creature
who
pushed
her
forward
to
join
her
fatherless
children
and
by
losing
her
place
in
the
crowd
was
jostled
where
she
did
not
know
but
dreamed
until
her
dying
day
edward
pressed
on
unaware
that
maggie
was
not
close
behind
him
he
was
deaf
to
reproaches
and
heedless
of
the
hand
stretched
out
to
hold
him
back
sprang
toward
the
boat
the
men
there
pushed
her
off
full
and
more
than
full
as
she
was
and
overboard
he
fell
into
the
sullen
heaving
waters
his
last
shout
had
been
on
maggie
name
a
name
she
never
thought
to
hear
again
on
earth
as
she
was
pressed
back
sick
and
suffocating
but
suddenly
a
voice
rang
out
above
all
confused
voices
and
moaning
hungry
waves
and
above
the
roaring
fire
maggie
maggie
my
maggie
out
of
the
steerage
side
of
the
crowd
a
tall
figure
issued
forth
begrimed
with
smoke
she
could
not
see
but
she
knew
as
a
tame
bird
flutters
to
the
human
breast
of
its
protector
when
affrighted
by
some
mortal
foe
so
maggie
fluttered
and
cowered
into
his
arms
and
for
a
moment
there
was
no
more
terror
or
thought
of
danger
in
the
hearts
of
those
twain
but
only
infinite
and
absolute
peace
she
had
no
wonder
how
he
came
there
it
was
enough
that
he
was
there
he
first
thought
of
the
destruction
that
was
present
with
them
he
was
as
calm
and
composed
as
if
they
sat
beneath
the
on
the
still
moorlands
far
away
he
took
her
without
a
word
to
the
end
of
the
he
lashed
her
to
a
piece
of
spar
she
never
spoke
maggie
he
said
my
only
chance
is
to
throw
you
overboard
this
spar
will
keep
you
floating
at
first
you
will
go
down
deep
deep
down
keep
your
mouth
and
eyes
shut
i
shall
be
there
when
you
come
up
by
god
help
i
will
struggle
bravely
for
you
she
looked
up
and
by
the
flashing
light
he
could
see
a
trusting
loving
smile
upon
her
face
and
he
smiled
back
at
her
a
grave
beautiful
look
fit
to
wear
on
his
face
in
heaven
he
helped
her
to
the
side
of
the
vessel
away
from
the
falling
burning
pieces
of
mast
then
for
a
moment
he
paused
if
maggie
i
may
be
throwing
you
in
to
death
he
put
his
hand
before
his
eyes
the
strong
man
lost
courage
then
she
spoke
i
am
not
afraid
god
is
with
us
whether
we
live
or
die
she
looked
as
quiet
and
happy
as
a
child
on
its
mother
breast
and
so
before
he
lost
heart
again
he
heaved
her
up
and
threw
her
as
far
as
he
could
over
into
the
glaring
dizzying
water
and
straight
leaped
after
her
she
came
up
with
an
involuntary
look
of
terror
on
her
face
but
when
she
saw
him
by
the
red
glare
of
the
burning
ship
close
by
her
side
she
shut
her
eyes
and
looked
as
if
peacefully
going
to
sleep
he
swam
guiding
the
spar
i
think
we
are
near
llandudno
i
know
we
have
passed
the
little
head
that
was
all
he
said
but
she
did
net
speak
he
swam
out
of
the
heat
and
fierce
blaze
of
light
into
the
quiet
dark
waters
and
then
into
the
moon
path
it
might
be
half
an
hour
before
he
got
into
that
silver
stream
when
the
beams
fell
down
upon
them
he
looked
at
maggie
her
head
rested
on
the
spar
quite
still
he
could
not
bear
it
maggie
dear
heart
speak
with
a
great
effort
she
was
called
back
from
the
borders
of
death
by
that
voice
and
opened
her
filmy
eyes
which
looked
abroad
as
if
she
could
see
nothing
nearer
than
the
gleaming
lights
of
heaven
she
let
the
lids
fall
softly
again
he
was
as
if
alone
in
the
wide
world
with
god
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
and
all
is
over
thought
he
the
people
at
llandudno
must
see
our
burning
ship
and
will
come
out
in
their
boats
he
kept
in
the
line
of
light
although
it
did
not
lead
him
direct
to
the
shore
in
order
that
they
might
be
seen
he
swam
with
desperation
one
moment
he
thought
he
had
heard
her
last
gasp
rattle
through
the
rush
of
the
waters
and
all
strength
was
gone
and
he
lay
on
the
waves
as
if
he
himself
must
die
and
go
with
her
spirit
straight
through
that
purple
lift
to
heaven
the
next
he
heard
the
splash
of
oars
and
raised
himself
and
cried
aloud
the
boatmen
took
them
in
and
examined
her
by
the
lantern
and
spoke
in
welsh
and
shook
their
heads
frank
threw
himself
on
his
knees
and
prayed
them
to
take
her
to
land
they
did
not
know
his
words
but
they
understood
his
prayer
he
kissed
her
lips
he
chafed
her
hands
he
wrung
the
water
out
of
her
hair
he
held
her
feet
against
his
warm
breast
she
is
not
dead
he
kept
saying
to
the
men
as
he
saw
their
sorrowful
pitying
looks
the
kind
people
at
llandudno
had
made
ready
their
own
humble
beds
with
every
appliance
of
comfort
they
could
think
of
as
soon
as
they
understood
the
nature
of
the
calamity
which
had
befallen
the
ship
on
their
coasts
frank
walked
dripping
bareheaded
by
the
body
of
his
margaret
which
was
borne
by
some
men
along
the
rocky
sloping
shore
she
is
not
dead
he
said
he
stopped
at
the
first
house
they
came
to
it
belonged
to
a
woman
they
laid
maggie
in
her
bed
and
got
the
village
doctor
to
come
and
see
her
there
is
life
still
said
he
gravely
i
knew
it
said
frank
but
it
felled
him
to
the
ground
he
sank
first
in
prayer
and
then
in
insensibility
the
doctor
did
everything
all
that
night
long
he
passed
to
and
fro
from
house
to
house
for
several
had
swum
to
llandudno
others
it
was
thought
had
gone
to
abergele
in
the
morning
frank
was
recovered
enough
to
write
to
his
father
by
maggie
bedside
he
sent
the
letter
off
to
conway
by
a
little
welsh
boy
late
in
the
afternoon
she
awoke
in
a
moment
or
two
she
looked
eagerly
round
her
as
if
gathering
in
her
breath
and
then
she
covered
her
head
and
sobbed
where
is
edward
asked
she
we
do
not
know
said
frank
gravely
i
have
been
round
the
village
and
seen
every
survivor
here
he
is
not
among
them
but
he
may
be
at
some
other
place
along
the
coast
she
was
silent
reading
in
his
eyes
his
fears
his
belief
at
last
she
asked
again
i
can
not
understand
it
my
head
is
not
clear
there
are
such
rushing
noises
in
it
how
came
you
there
she
shuddered
involuntarily
as
she
recalled
the
terrible
where
for
an
instant
he
dreaded
for
her
sake
to
recall
the
circumstances
of
the
night
before
but
then
he
understood
how
her
mind
would
dwell
upon
them
until
she
was
satisfied
you
remember
writing
to
me
love
telling
me
all
i
got
your
letter
i
do
know
how
long
ago
yesterday
i
think
yes
in
the
evening
you
could
not
think
maggie
i
would
let
you
go
alone
to
america
i
wo
speak
against
edward
poor
fellow
but
we
must
both
allow
that
he
was
not
the
person
to
watch
over
you
as
such
a
treasure
should
be
watched
over
i
thought
i
would
go
with
you
i
hardly
know
if
i
meant
to
make
myself
known
to
you
all
at
once
for
i
had
no
wish
to
have
much
to
do
with
your
brother
i
see
now
that
it
was
selfish
in
me
well
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
after
receiving
your
letter
but
to
set
off
for
liverpool
straight
and
join
you
and
after
that
decision
was
made
my
spirits
rose
for
the
old
talks
about
canada
and
australia
came
to
my
mind
and
this
seemed
like
a
realization
of
them
besides
maggie
i
suspected
i
even
suspect
now
that
my
father
had
something
to
do
with
your
going
with
edward
indeed
frank
said
she
earnestly
you
are
mistaken
i
can
not
tell
you
all
now
but
he
was
so
good
and
kind
at
last
he
never
urged
me
to
go
though
i
believe
he
did
tell
me
it
would
be
the
saving
of
edward
do
agitate
yourself
love
i
trust
there
will
be
time
enough
some
happy
day
at
home
to
tell
me
all
and
till
then
i
will
believe
that
my
father
did
not
in
any
way
suggest
this
voyage
but
you
allow
that
after
all
that
has
passed
it
was
not
unnatural
in
me
to
suppose
so
i
only
told
middleton
i
was
obliged
to
leave
him
by
the
next
train
it
was
not
till
i
was
fairly
off
that
i
began
to
reckon
up
what
money
i
had
with
me
i
doubt
even
if
i
was
sorry
to
find
it
was
so
little
i
should
have
to
put
forth
my
energies
and
fight
my
way
as
i
had
often
wanted
to
do
i
remember
i
thought
how
happy
you
and
i
would
be
striving
together
as
poor
people
that
new
world
which
is
the
old
then
you
had
told
me
you
were
going
in
the
steerage
and
that
was
all
suitable
to
my
desires
for
myself
it
was
erminia
kindness
that
prevented
our
going
there
she
asked
your
father
to
take
us
cabin
places
unknown
to
me
did
she
dear
erminia
it
is
just
like
her
i
could
almost
laugh
to
remember
the
eagerness
with
which
i
doffed
my
signs
of
wealth
and
put
on
those
of
poverty
i
sold
my
watch
when
i
got
into
liverpool
yesterday
i
believe
but
it
seems
like
months
ago
and
i
rigged
myself
out
at
a
with
suitable
clothes
for
a
steerage
passenger
maggie
you
never
told
me
the
name
of
the
vessel
you
were
going
to
sail
in
i
did
not
know
it
till
i
got
to
liverpool
all
buxton
said
was
that
some
ship
sailed
on
the
i
concluded
it
must
be
the
poor
and
i
had
no
time
to
lose
she
had
just
heaved
her
anchor
when
i
came
on
board
you
recollect
a
boat
hailing
her
at
the
last
moment
there
were
three
of
us
in
her
no
i
was
below
in
my
cabin
trying
not
to
think
said
she
coloring
a
little
well
as
soon
as
i
got
on
board
it
began
to
grow
dark
or
perhaps
it
was
the
fog
on
the
river
at
any
rate
instead
of
being
able
to
single
out
your
figure
at
once
maggie
it
is
one
among
a
thousand
i
had
to
go
peering
into
every
woman
face
and
many
were
below
i
went
between
decks
and
i
was
afraid
i
had
mistaken
the
vessel
i
sat
down
i
had
no
spirit
to
stand
and
every
time
the
door
opened
i
roused
up
and
looked
but
you
never
came
i
was
thinking
what
to
do
whether
to
be
put
on
shore
in
ireland
or
to
go
on
to
new
york
and
wait
for
you
there
if
was
the
worst
time
of
all
for
i
had
nothing
to
do
and
the
suspense
was
horrible
i
might
have
known
said
he
smiling
my
little
emperor
of
russia
was
not
one
to
be
a
steerage
passenger
but
maggie
was
too
much
shaken
to
smile
and
the
thought
of
edward
lay
heavy
upon
her
mind
then
the
fire
broke
out
how
or
why
i
suppose
will
never
be
ascertained
it
was
at
our
end
of
the
vessel
i
thanked
god
then
that
you
were
not
there
the
second
mate
wanted
some
one
to
go
down
with
him
to
bring
up
the
gunpowder
and
throw
it
overboard
i
had
nothing
to
do
and
i
went
we
wrapped
it
up
in
wet
sails
but
it
was
a
ticklish
piece
of
work
and
took
time
when
we
had
got
it
overboard
the
flames
were
gathering
far
and
wide
i
do
remember
what
i
did
until
i
heard
edward
voice
speaking
your
name
it
was
decided
that
the
next
morning
they
should
set
off
homeward
striving
on
their
way
to
obtain
tidings
of
edward
frank
would
have
given
his
only
valuable
his
mother
which
he
wore
constantly
as
a
pledge
for
some
advance
of
money
but
the
kind
welsh
people
would
not
have
it
they
had
not
much
spare
cash
but
what
they
had
they
readily
lent
to
the
survivors
of
the
dressed
in
the
homely
country
garb
of
the
people
frank
and
maggie
set
off
in
their
car
if
was
a
clear
frosty
morning
the
first
that
winter
the
road
soon
lay
high
up
on
the
cliffs
along
the
coast
they
looked
down
on
the
sea
rocking
below
at
every
village
they
stopped
and
frank
inquired
and
made
the
driver
inquire
in
welsh
but
no
tidings
gained
they
of
edward
though
here
and
there
maggie
watched
frank
into
some
cottage
or
other
going
to
see
a
dead
body
beloved
by
some
one
and
when
he
came
out
solemn
and
grave
their
sad
eyes
met
and
she
knew
it
was
not
he
they
sought
without
needing
words
at
abergele
they
stopped
to
rest
and
because
being
a
larger
place
it
would
need
a
longer
search
maggie
lay
down
on
the
sofa
for
she
was
very
weak
and
shut
her
eyes
and
tried
not
to
see
forever
and
ever
that
mad
struggling
crowd
lighted
by
the
red
flames
frank
came
back
in
an
hour
or
so
and
soft
behind
him
laboriously
treading
on
tiptoe
buxton
followed
he
was
evidently
choking
down
his
sobs
but
when
he
saw
the
white
wan
figure
of
maggie
he
held
out
his
arms
my
dear
my
daughter
he
said
god
bless
you
he
could
not
speak
more
he
was
fairly
crying
but
he
put
her
hand
in
frank
and
kept
holding
them
both
my
father
said
frank
speaking
in
a
husky
voice
while
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
had
heard
of
it
before
he
received
my
letter
i
might
have
known
that
the
lighthouse
signals
would
take
it
fast
to
liverpool
i
had
written
a
few
lines
to
him
saying
i
was
going
to
you
happily
they
never
reached
that
was
spared
to
my
dear
father
maggie
saw
the
look
of
restored
confidence
that
passed
between
father
and
son
my
mother
said
she
at
last
she
is
here
said
they
both
at
once
with
sad
solemnity
oh
where
why
did
not
you
tell
me
exclaimed
she
starting
up
but
their
faces
told
her
why
edward
is
drowned
is
dead
said
she
reading
their
looks
there
was
no
answer
let
me
go
to
my
mother
maggie
she
is
with
him
his
body
was
washed
ashore
last
night
my
father
and
she
heard
of
it
as
they
came
along
can
you
bear
to
see
her
she
will
not
leave
him
take
me
to
her
maggie
answered
they
led
her
into
a
stretched
on
the
bed
lay
edward
but
now
so
full
of
hope
and
worldly
plans
browne
looked
round
and
saw
maggie
she
did
not
get
up
from
her
place
by
his
head
nor
did
she
long
avert
her
gaze
from
his
poor
face
but
she
held
maggie
hand
as
the
girl
knelt
by
her
and
spoke
to
her
in
a
hushed
voice
undisturbed
by
tears
her
miserable
heart
could
not
find
that
relief
he
is
dead
he
is
gone
he
will
never
come
back
again
if
he
had
gone
to
america
it
might
have
been
years
first
but
he
would
have
come
back
to
me
but
now
he
will
never
come
back
again
never
never
her
voice
died
away
as
the
wailings
of
the
die
in
the
distance
and
there
was
silence
silence
more
sad
and
hopeless
than
any
passionate
words
of
grief
and
to
this
day
it
is
the
same
she
prizes
her
dead
son
more
than
a
thousand
living
daughters
happy
and
prosperous
as
is
maggie
now
rich
in
the
love
of
many
if
maggie
did
not
show
such
reverence
to
her
faithful
sorrows
others
might
wonder
at
her
refusal
to
be
comforted
by
that
sweet
daughter
but
maggie
treats
her
with
such
tender
sympathy
never
thinking
of
herself
or
her
own
claims
that
frank
erminia
buxton
nancy
and
all
are
reverent
and
sympathizing

mary
queen
of
this
history
is
given
here
minute
in
every
point
of
real
interest
and
without
the
encumbrance
of
useless
opinions
there
is
no
sentence
thrown
away
no
time
lost
in
mere
ornament
perhaps
no
book
extant
containing
so
few
pages
can
said
to
convey
so
many
genuine
historical
facts
there
is
here
no
attempt
to
glaze
over
recorded
truth
or
win
the
reader
by
sophistry
to
opinions
merely
those
of
the
author
the
pure
simple
history
of
queen
mary
is
placed
before
the
reader
and
each
one
is
left
to
form
an
unbiased
opinion
from
events
impartially
recorded
there
one
great
and
most
valuable
feature
in
this
little
work
is
a
map
of
scotland
with
many
engravings
of
the
royal
castles
and
wild
scenes
connected
with
history
there
is
also
a
beautiful
portrait
of
the
queen
and
a
richly
illuminated
such
as
only
the
harpers
can
get
up
queen
full
of
instructive
and
incident
displayed
by
the
hand
of
a
master
we
doubt
whether
old
queen
bess
ever
before
had
so
much
justice
done
to
her
within
the
same
compass
such
a
pen
as
jacob
abbott
wields
especially
in
this
department
of
literature
has
no
right
to
lie
still
charles
the
we
incline
to
think
that
there
never
was
before
so
much
said
about
this
unfortunate
monarch
in
so
short
a
space
so
much
to
the
purpose
with
so
much
impartiality
and
in
such
a
style
as
just
suits
those
for
whom
it
is
designed
the
two
millions
of
young
persons
in
the
united
states
who
ought
to
be
supplied
with
such
works
as
these
the
engravings
represent
the
prominent
persons
and
places
of
the
history
and
are
well
executed
the
portrait
of
john
hampden
is
charming
the
antique
is
christian
hannibal
the
a
new
volume
of
the
series
projected
by
the
skillful
abbott
who
displays
no
little
tact
in
engaging
the
attention
of
that
marvellous
body
the
reading
public
in
old
scholastic
topics
hitherto
almost
exclusively
the
property
of
the
learned
the
latter
with
their
ingenious
implements
of
lexicons
and
scholia
will
be
in
no
danger
of
being
superseded
however
while
the
reader
may
gain
something
from
the
and
volumes
of
abbott
the
story
of
hannibal
is
well
adapted
for
popular
treatment
and
loses
nothing
for
this
purpose
in
the
present
explanatory
and
pictorial
maria
in
a
style
copious
and
yet
forcible
with
an
expression
singularly
clear
and
happy
and
in
language
exceedingly
chaste
and
at
times
very
beautiful
he
has
given
us
a
plain
unvarnished
narrative
of
facts
as
he
himself
says
unclogged
by
individual
reflections
which
would
only
encumber
rather
than
enforce
the
present
work
wants
none
of
the
interest
inseparably
connecting
itself
with
the
preceding
numbers
of

is
characterized
throughout

peculiar
beauties
