on
the

coast
of
norway
off
the
town
of
arendal
stand
planted
far
out
into
the
sea
the
white
walls
of
the
great
and
little
torungen
lighthouses
each
on
its
bare
of
corresponding
name
the
lesser
of
which
seems
as
you
sail
past
to
have
only
just
room
for
the
lighthouse
and
the
attendant
residence
by
the
side
it
is
a
wild
and
lonely
situation
the
spray
in
stormy
weather
driving
in
sheets
against
the
walls
and
eagles
and
not
unfrequently
dashing
themselves
to
death
against
the
thick
glass
panes
at
night
while
in
winter
all
communication
with
the
land
is
very
often
cut
off
either
by
drift
or
patchy
ice
which
is
impassable
either
on
foot
or
by
boat
these
however
and
others
of
the
now
numerous
lights
along
that
dangerous
coast
are
of
comparatively
recent
erection
many
persons
now
living
can
remember
the
time
when
for
long
reaches
the
only
lighting
was
the
gleam
of
the
white
breakers
themselves
and
the
captain
who
had
passed
the
oxö
light
off
christiansand
might
think
himself
lucky
if
he
sighted
the
distant
jomfruland
up
by
kragerö
about
a
score
of
years
before
the
lighthouse
was
placed
on
little
torungen
there
was
however
already
a
house
there
if
it
could
be
dignified
by
that
name
with
its
back
and
one
side
almost
up
to
the
eave
of
the
roof
stuck
into
a
heap
of
stones
so
that
it
had
the
appearance
of
bending
forward
to
let
the
storm
sweep
over
it
the
low
opened
to
the
land
and
two
small
windows
looked
out
upon
the
sea
and
upon
the
boat
which
was
usually
drawn
up
in
a
cleft
above
the
outside
when
you
entered
or
more
properly
speaking
descended
into
it
there
was
more
room
than
might
have
been
expected
and
it
contained
sundry
articles
of
furniture
such
as
a
handsome
press
and
sideboard
which
no
one
would
have
dreamt
of
finding
under
such
a
roof
in
one
corner
there
stood
an
old
covered
with
dust
and
with
a
tuft
of
wool
still
hanging
from
its
reel
from
which
and
from
other
small
indications
it
might
be
surmised
that
there
had
once
been
a
woman
in
the
house
and
that
tuft
of
wool
had
probably
been
her
last
spin
there
sat
now
on
the
bench
by
the
hearth
a
lonely
old
man
of
a
and
somewhat
gloomy
countenance
with
a
mass
of
white
hair
falling
over
his
ears
and
neck
who
was
generally
occupied
with
some
cobbling
work
and
who
from
time
to
time
as
he
drew
out
the
thread
would
make
some
remark
aloud
as
if
he
thought
he
still
had
the
partner
of
his
life
for
audience
the
look
askance
over
his
brass
spectacles
with
which
he
greeted
any
casual
stranger
who
might
come
into
the
house
had
very
little
welcome
in
it
and
an
expression
about
his
sunken
mouth
and
sharp
chin
said
plainly
enough
that
the
other
might
state
his
business
at
once
and
be
gone
he
sought
no
company
and
the
only
time
he
had
ever
been
seen
at
church
was
when
he
came
rowing
over
to
tromö
with
his
wife
body
in
her
coffin
when
the
pastor
sprinkled
earth
upon
it
it
was
observed
that
the
tears
streamed
down
his
cheeks
and
it
was
long
after
dark
before
he
quitted
the
churchyard
to
return
he
had
become
a
proverb
for
obstinacy
for
miles
beyond
his
own
residence
and
people
who
dealt
with
him
for
fish
in
the
harbour
if
they
once
began
to
bargain
were
as
likely
as
not
to
see
him
without
a
word
just
quietly
row
away
all
that
was
known
further
about
old
jacob
as
he
was
called
was
that
he
had
once
been
a
pilot
and
that
he
had
had
a
son
who
had
taken
to
drinking
through
whose
fault
it
had
been
eventually
that
the
father
had
lost
his
certificate
and
it
was
thought
that
on
the
occasion
in
question
the
father
had
taken
the
son
blame
upon
himself
since
then
he
had
shunned
society
and
had
retired
with
his
wife
to
his
present
habitation
whither
after
their
son
was
drowned
they
had
brought
their
little
orphan
granddaughter
who
now
was
his
sole
companion
his
only
ostensible
means
of
living
were
by
shoemaking
and
by
fishing
the
produce
of
which
he
generally
disposed
of
to
passing
ships
and
during
the
earlier
period
of
his
sojourn
there
by
shooting
occasionally
but
it
was
understood
that
he
received
a
small
regular
contribution
from
several
of
the
pilots
certificated
or
otherwise
of
the
district
for
keeping
a
fire
alight
on
his
hearth
during
the
dark
autumn
nights
and
so
giving
them
by
the
light
from
his
two
windows
something
to
steer
by
when
they
arrived
off
the
coast
after
nightfall
whether
the
light
was
shown
for
their
benefit
particularly
or
whether
it
was
not
rather
intended
for
the
guidance
of
smuggling
vessels
standing
in
under
cover
of
the
night
to
land
their
cargoes
it
was
not
their
business
to
inquire
its
friendly
assistance
was
at
all
events
not
unacknowledged
by
these
latter
and
very
acceptable
presents
in
the
shape
of
kegs
of
spirits
bags
of
coffee
tobacco
meal
and
so
forth
would
from
time
to
time
come
rolling
into
the
old
man
room
so
that
upon
the
whole
he
was
enough
out
there
upon
his
rock
of
late
years
he
had
fallen
into
feeble
health
and
found
it
not
so
easy
to
row
the
long
distance
over
to
land
even
in
his
best
days
he
had
owing
to
an
old
injury
to
one
of
his
legs
found
some
difficulty
in
getting
down
to
the
boat
and
now
therefore
he
sat
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
over
the
hearth
in
his
woolen
jacket
and
leather
breeches
with
his
indoor
work
now
and
then
when
his
granddaughter
a
child
with
a
thick
crop
of
hair
falling
about
her
ears
and
a
rough
dog
constantly
at
her
heels
would
burst
into
the
house
with
all
the
freshness
of
the
outside
air
blowing
round
her
as
it
were
and
deliver
herself
of
her
intelligence
he
might
be
drawn
perhaps
to
the
window
to
look
out
over
the
sea
and
afterwards
like
a
growling
bear
disturbed
from
its
lair
even
follow
her
with
some
difficulty
out
of
the
door
with
the
spyglass
there
he
would
station
himself
so
as
to
use
her
shoulder
as
a
rest
for
his
shaking
hand
and
with
his
directions
and
growling
going
on
behind
her
neck
she
would
do
her
best
to
fix
the
glass
on
the
desired
object
his
crossness
would
then
disappear
little
by
little
in
their
joint
speculation
as
to
what
ship
it
could
be
or
in
whatever
remarks
it
might
suggest
and
after
giving
his
decision
the
old
man
would
generally
hobble
in
again
he
was
really
very
proud
of
his
granddaughter
cleverness
she
could
distinguish
with
her
naked
eye
as
clearly
as
he
could
through
the
glass
she
never
made
a
mistake
about
the
craft
large
or
small
that
belonged
to
that
part
of
the
coast
and
could
besides
say
to
a
nicety
what
sort
of
master
each
had
her
superiority
of
sight
she
asserted
too
with
a
tyranny
to
which
he
made
no
resistance
although
it
might
have
tried
a
temper
many
degrees
more
patient
than
his
was
one
day
however
she
was
at
a
loss
they
made
out
a
crescent
on
the
flag
and
this
caused
even
the
old
man
a
moment
astonishment
but
he
declared
then
for
her
information
shortly
and
decisively
that
it
was
a
barbarian
this
satisfied
her
for
a
moment
but
then
she
asked
what
is
a
barbarian
grandfather
it
is
a
turk
yes
but
a
turk
oh
it
it
a
mohammedan
a
what
a
moham
a
mohammedan
a
robber
on
board
ship
on
board
ship
he
was
not
going
to
give
up
his
ascendancy
in
the
matter
hard
as
she
pushed
him
so
he
bethought
him
of
a
pack
of
old
tales
and
went
on
to
explain
drily
they
go
to
the
baltic
to
russia
to
salt
human
flesh
human
flesh
yes
and
sometimes
too
they
seize
vessels
in
the
open
sea
and
do
their
salting
there
she
fixed
a
pair
of
large
terrified
eyes
on
him
which
made
the
old
man
continue
and
it
is
especially
for
little
girls
they
look
that
meat
is
the
finest
and
goes
by
tons
down
to
the
grand
turk
having
played
this
last
trump
he
was
going
in
again
but
was
stopped
by
her
eager
question
do
they
use
a
glass
there
on
board
and
when
he
said
they
did
she
slipped
quickly
by
him
through
the
door
and
kept
cautiously
within
as
long
as
the
vessel
was
to
be
seen
through
the
on
the
horizon
the
moods
of
the
two
were
for
once
reversed
the
old
man
looked
very
sly
over
his
work
whilst
she
was
quiet
and
cowed
once
only
she
broke
out
angrily
but
why
does
the
king
get
rid
of
them
if
i
was
captain
of
a
i
yes
elizabeth
if
you
were
captain
of
a
what
then
the
child
conceptions
apparently
reached
no
further
than
such
matters
as
these
as
yet
she
had
seen
few
human
beings
as
she
grew
up
and
in
recent
years
after
her
grandmother
death
she
and
her
grandfather
had
been
the
only
regular
inhabitants
of
the
island
every
now
and
then
there
might
perhaps
come
a
boat
on
one
errand
or
another
and
a
couple
of
times
she
had
paid
a
visit
to
her
maternal
aunt
on
land
at
arendal
her
grandfather
had
taught
her
to
read
and
write
and
with
what
she
found
in
the
bible
and
and
in
of
danish
and
norwegian
naval
heroes
a
book
in
their
possession
she
had
in
a
manner
lived
pretty
much
upon
the
anecdotes
which
in
leisure
moments
she
could
extract
from
that
grandfather
so
chary
of
his
speech
about
his
sailor
life
in
his
youth
they
had
besides
in
the
little
inner
room
a
small
print
without
a
frame
of
the
action
near
the
heather
islands
in
which
he
had
taken
part
it
represented
the
frigate
naiad
with
the
brigs
samso
kiel
and
lolland
in
furious
conflict
with
the
english
ship
of
the
line
dictator
which
lay
across
the
narrow
harbour
with
the
brig
calypso
and
was
pounding
the
naiad
to
pieces
the
names
of
the
ships
were
printed
underneath
on
the
print
there
was
little
to
be
seen
but
and
and
a
confusion
of
smoke
but
in
this
had
the
child
lived
whole
years
of
her
life
and
many
a
time
in
fancy
had
she
stood
there
and
fought
the
englishman
and
their
officers
had
become
the
highest
conception
of
her
fancy
and
the
dearest
wish
of
her
heart
was
that
a
might
some
day
pass
so
near
to
torungen
that
she
would
be
able
to
see
distinctly
everything
on
board
chapter
ii
after
old
jacob
had
fallen
into
ill
health
lighterman
kristiansen
used
to
come
out
oftener
to
torungen
with
provisions
and
other
necessaries
and
his
visits
now
became
periodical
he
was
accompanied
one
autumn
by
his
son
salvé
a
handsome
lad
with
a
sharp
clever
face
who
had
worked
in
the
along
the
coast
from
his
childhood
almost
and
had
in
fact
been
brought
up
amongst
its
sunken
rocks
and
reefs
and
breakers
he
was
something
small
in
stature
perhaps
but
what
he
wanted
in
robustness
he
made
up
in
readiness
and
activity
qualities
which
stood
him
in
good
stead
in
the
many
quarrels
into
which
his
too
ready
tongue
was
wont
to
bring
him
he
was
eighteen
years
old
at
this
time
had
been
already
engaged
as
an
able
seaman
and
was
in
great
request
at
the
sandvigen
and
vraangen
dances
a
fact
of
which
he
was
perfectly
well
aware
old
jacob
granddaughter
being
a
little
girl
of
only
fourteen
years
of
age
was
of
course
altogether
beneath
his
notice
and
he
condescend
to
speak
to
her
he
merely
delivered
himself
of
the
witticism
that
she
was
like
a
heron
and
with
her
thick
checked
woollen
handkerchief
tied
with
the
ends
behind
her
waist
the
resemblance
was
not
so
very
at
any
rate
he
declared
on
the
way
home
that
such
a
specimen
of
womankind
he
for
his
part
had
never
come
across
before
and
that
he
would
give
anything
to
see
her
dancing
in
the
public
room
with
her
thin
arms
and
legs
it
would
be
like
a
grasshopper
the
next
time
he
came
she
took
out
her
grandfather
watch
in
its
silver
case
and
showed
it
to
him
and
some
conversation
passed
between
them
his
first
impression
of
her
was
that
she
was
stupid
she
asked
questions
about
every
sort
of
thing
and
seemed
to
think
that
he
must
know
everything
and
finally
she
wanted
to
know
what
it
was
like
on
shore
among
the
great
folk
of
arendal
and
particularly
how
the
ladies
behaved
it
afforded
him
much
amusement
at
the
time
to
see
with
what
simple
credulity
she
took
in
everything
he
chose
to
invent
on
the
subject
but
after
he
had
left
he
was
not
sure
that
he
was
sorry
for
what
he
had
done
and
at
the
same
time
he
made
the
discovery
that
the
girl
in
her
way
was
anything
but
silly
his
remorse
was
to
be
brought
home
to
him
presently
for
old
jacob
had
had
duly
recounted
to
him
over
again
all
his
stories
and
was
in
high
dudgeon
when
he
came
again
the
old
man
was
very
snappish
to
him
and
he
found
it
so
unpleasant
in
the
house
that
he
made
all
the
haste
he
could
to
get
his
business
done
while
he
was
thus
occupied
the
little
girl
told
him
all
about
the
naiad
and
the
part
her
grandfather
had
taken
in
the
action
salvé
who
was
ruffled
and
thought
the
old
man
had
been
an
old
dog
followed
the
relation
from
time
to
time
with
a
sneering
remark
which
in
her
eagerness
she
did
notice
or
did
understand
but
when
he
had
finished
what
he
had
to
do
he
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
in
a
way
she
did
understand
he
laughed
incredulously
old
jacob
there
on
board
the
naiad
this
is
the
first
time
anybody
ever
heard
of
it
the
individual
in
question
unfortunately
came
out
at
the
moment
to
see
the
boat
off
and
turning
to
him
red
with
anger
she
cried
grandfather
he
does
believe
you
were
on
board
the
naiad
that
time
the
old
man
answered
at
first
as
if
he
did
deign
to
enter
upon
any
controversy
on
the
subject
oh
i
suppose
it
only
little
girls
prattle
again
but
whether
it
was
wounded
vanity
or
a
sudden
access
of
irritation
against
the
lad
or
that
his
eye
fell
upon
his
granddaughter
standing
there
so
evidently
incensed
and
resentful
he
flared
up
the
next
moment
and
thrusting
his
huge
fist
under
the
youngster
nose
burst
out
if
you
want
to
know
all
about
it
you
young
swabber
i
may
tell
you
i
stood
on
the
naiad
with
better
folk
than
are
ever
likely
to
come
across
he
stamped
his
foot
here
as
if
he
had
the
deck
under
him
when
with
one
broadside
from
the
dictator
the
three
masts
and
bowsprit
were
shot
away
and
the
main
deck
came
crashing
down
upon
the
lower
the
last
sentence
was
taken
from
of
danish
and
norwegian
naval
heroes
and
the
old
man
was
as
proud
of
these
lines
as
he
would
have
been
of
a
medal
when
the
crash
came
he
pursued
always
in
the
same
posture
and
in
the
manner
of
the
sacred
text
he
who
stands
here
and
tells
the
tale
had
but
just
time
to
save
himself
by
leaping
into
the
sea
through
a
but
he
threw
off
then
the
trammels
of
the
text
and
continued
propriâ
violently
gesticulating
with
his
fists
and
steadily
advancing
all
the
time
while
salvé
prudently
retreated
before
his
advance
down
to
the
boat
we
do
deal
in
lies
and
fabricate
stories
out
here
like
you
you
young
of
a
ship
cub
and
if
it
was
for
your
father
who
has
sense
enough
to
you
himself
i
lay
a
stick
across
your
back
till
you
had
a
howl
left
in
you
with
this
finale
of
the
longest
speech
to
which
he
had
given
vent
for
thirty
years
perhaps
he
turned
with
a
short
nod
to
the
father
and
went
into
the
house
again
elizabeth
was
miserable
that
salvé
should
go
away
like
this
without
so
much
as
deigning
to
say
to
her
and
her
grandfather
was
cross
enough
himself
for
he
was
afraid
that
he
had
done
something
foolish
and
broken
with
the
lighterman
chapter
iii
salvé
came
out
to
the
rock
again
the
next
autumn
after
a
voyage
to
liverpool
and
havre
at
first
he
was
rather
shy
although
his
father
and
old
jacob
torungen
had
in
the
interval
in
spite
of
that
little
affair
of
the
previous
year
been
on
the
best
of
terms
the
white
bear
however
as
he
called
him
seemed
to
have
altogether
forgotten
what
had
passed
and
with
the
girl
he
was
very
easily
reconciled
she
had
learnt
now
not
to
tell
everything
to
her
grandfather
whilst
the
lighterman
and
old
jacob
enjoyed
a
glass
together
in
the
house
salvé
carried
the
things
up
to
the
cellar
elizabeth
following
him
up
and
down
every
time
and
the
conversation
meanwhile
going
round
all
the
points
of
the
compass
so
to
speak
after
she
had
asked
him
about
havre
de
grace
where
he
had
been
and
about
america
where
he
had
not
been
if
his
captain
wife
was
as
fine
as
a
captain
and
then
if
he
would
like
one
day
to
marry
a
fine
lady
she
wanted
at
last
to
know
from
the
laughing
sailor
lad
if
the
officers
wives
were
ever
allowed
to
be
with
them
in
war
her
face
had
of
late
acquired
something
wonderfully
attractive
in
its
expression
such
a
seriousness
would
come
over
it
sometimes
although
she
continued
as
childlike
as
ever
and
such
eyes
as
hers
were
at
all
events
in
salvé
experience
not
common
at
any
rate
after
this
he
invariably
accompanied
his
father
upon
these
expeditions
the
last
time
he
was
out
there
he
told
her
about
the
dances
on
shore
at
sandvigen
and
took
care
to
give
her
to
understand
that
the
girls
made
much
of
him
there
but
he
was
tired
now
of
dancing
with
them
she
was
very
curious
on
this
subject
and
extracted
from
him
that
he
had
had
two
tremendous
fights
that
winter
she
looked
at
him
in
terror
and
asked
rather
hesitatingly
but
had
they
done
anything
to
you
oh
no
all
dancing
entertainments
have
a
little
extra
dance
like
that
to
wind
up
with
they
merely
wanted
to
dance
with
the
girl
i
had
asked
first
is
it
so
dangerous
then
what
sort
of
a
girl
was
she
i
mean
what
was
her
name
oh
one
was
called
marie
and
the
other
was
anne
herluf
daughter
they
were
pretty
girls
i
can
tell
you
anne
had
a
white
brooch
and
earrings
and
danced
more
smoothly
than
ever
you
saw
a
cutter
sail
mate
george
said
the
same
the
upshot
of
this
conversation
was
that
she
found
out
that
the
girls
in
arendal
and
in
the
ports
generally
where
he
had
touched
were
all
well
dressed
and
the
next
time
he
returned
from
holland
he
promised
he
would
bring
with
him
a
pair
of
shoes
with
silver
buckles
for
her
with
this
promise
they
parted
after
she
had
allowed
him
and
that
there
might
be
no
mistake
twice
over
to
take
the
accurate
measure
of
her
foot
and
there
were
roses
of
joy
in
her
cheeks
as
she
called
after
him
to
be
sure
and
not
forget
them
the
year
after
salvé
came
with
the
shoes
there
were
silver
buckles
in
them
and
they
were
very
smart
but
if
they
were
they
had
cost
him
more
than
half
a
month
pay
elizabeth
was
more
carefully
dressed
now
and
might
almost
be
called
grown
up
she
hesitated
about
accepting
the
shoes
and
did
ask
questions
about
everything
as
she
used
to
do
nor
was
she
so
willing
to
stand
and
talk
with
him
alone
by
the
boat
she
liked
to
have
him
up
within
hearing
of
the
others
do
you
see
how
high
the
sea
is
running
he
said
and
tried
to
persuade
her
that
the
boat
would
be
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
but
she
saw
that
it
was
true
and
went
up
with
a
little
toss
of
her
head
alone
he
followed
her
she
must
have
learned
all
this
in
arendal
where
in
the
course
of
the
autumn
she
had
been
confirmed
and
where
she
had
lived
with
her
aunt
but
she
had
grown
marvellously
handsome
in
that
time
so
much
so
indeed
that
salvé
was
almost
taken
aback
when
he
saw
her
and
when
they
said
it
was
no
longer
in
the
old
laughing
tones
but
with
some
slight
embarrassment
on
his
side
he
did
seem
to
know
exactly
how
matters
lay
between
them
after
that
she
filled
his
head
so
completely
that
he
had
not
a
thought
for
anything
else
chapter
iv
the
old
juno
to
which
salvé
belonged
was
lying
at
that
time
at
sandvigen
and
was
only
waiting
for
a
wind
to
come
out
she
was
a
vessel
with
a
crew
of
nineteen
hands
all
told
which
had
plied
for
many
years
in
american
waters
and
off
and
on
in
the
north
sea
and
was
reckoned
at
the
time
one
of
arendal
largest
craft
her
arrival
or
departure
was
quite
an
event
for
the
town
and
neighbourhood
and
to
have
a
berth
in
her
was
considered
among
the
sailors
of
the
district
a
very
high
honour
indeed
the
more
so
that
her
master
and
principal
owner
captain
beck
was
a
particularly
good
chief
to
serve
under
and
a
lucky
one
to
boot
when
at
last
between
ten
and
eleven
one
morning
she
weighed
anchor
and
before
a
light
breeze
with
her
small
sails
set
glided
out
to
sea
the
quays
were
crowded
with
spectators
the
majority
of
the
crew
belonging
to
the
place
and
it
being
generally
known
that
they
were
bound
on
a
longer
voyage
than
usual
on
board
she
had
with
her
still
the
captain
son
carl
beck
a
smart
young
naval
officer
with
his
sister
and
a
small
party
of
their
friends
who
meant
to
land
out
on
the
torungens
in
the
they
had
in
tow
they
wished
to
remain
with
her
as
long
as
possible
and
for
the
purpose
had
made
up
a
party
to
the
islands
where
the
gentlemen
proposed
to
shoot
some
of
the
which
are
to
be
found
out
there
on
the
rocks
in
swarms
at
the
spring
season
of
the
year
on
their
passage
north
along
the
coast
it
was
about
four
when
they
passed
little
torungen
and
as
there
were
swells
then
bursting
in
white
jets
upon
the
reefs
and
a
line
of
dark
clouds
about
the
sunset
which
looked
like
heavy
weather
coming
up
the
pleasure
party
determined
to
leave
the
vessel
here
instead
of
going
on
as
they
had
intended
to
the
larger
of
the
two
islands
as
they
went
over
the
side
salvé
kristiansen
was
standing
out
on
the
forecastle
gazing
eagerly
over
to
where
the
barren
mass
of
rock
lay
like
a
dipping
hull
in
the
distance
bathed
in
the
evening
sun
and
with
a
fringe
of
foam
round
its
base
and
he
could
see
old
granddaughter
standing
by
the
wall
of
the
house
with
the
glass
he
had
chosen
on
purpose
a
conspicuous
place
and
stood
with
his
back
against
the
stay
so
heavy
of
heart
and
sad
at
having
to
go
away
that
it
would
have
taken
very
little
to
make
him
burst
into
tears
it
seemed
to
have
dawned
upon
him
all
of
a
sudden
that
he
was
in
love
to
try
whether
it
was
upon
him
that
she
was
directing
the
glass
or
at
the
unusual
discharging
of
freight
into
the
he
waved
his
hat
and
his
whole
face
lighted
up
with
joy
as
he
saw
her
return
his
signal
he
took
off
his
hat
again
and
received
another
wave
of
the
glass
in
reply
he
stood
there
then
straining
his
eyes
abstractedly
in
the
direction
of
the
rock
until
it
disappeared
behind
them
in
the
gathering
twilight
he
had
been
inspirited
for
the
whole
voyage
and
the
first
thing
he
should
do
when
they
arrived
at
boston
would
be
to
buy
a
dress
and
a
ring
and
when
he
came
home
he
determined
that
his
first
business
should
be
to
make
an
expedition
to
the
island
and
put
a
certain
question
to
a
certain
person
whom
he
knew
out
there
he
was
roused
from
his
abstraction
by
the
boatswain
bawling
out
his
name
and
asking
if
he
was
going
to
sleep
there
and
whether
he
wanted
something
to
wake
him
up
the
order
had
been
given
to
make
all
snug
for
the
night
as
the
breeze
was
freshening
the
watches
had
been
set
at
noon
and
the
starboard
and
larboard
watch
told
off
as
customary
on
the
first
day
a
vessel
goes
to
sea
salvé
had
the
middle
watch
and
by
that
time
the
sea
was
running
high
and
they
were
plunging
through
the
darkness
under
a
mainsail
the
moon
every
now
and
then
clearing
an
open
space
in
the
storm
clouds
that
were
driving
like
smoke
before
it
so
that
he
could
fitfully
distinguish
objects
over
the
deck
even
to
the
man
looming
figure
out
upon
the
forecastle
upon
the
capstan
bar
sat
a
sailor
in
oilskin
clothes
who
had
probably
been
on
shore
the
previous
night
and
not
closed
his
eyes
and
who
was
making
great
efforts
to
keep
awake
his
head
however
would
still
keep
nodding
and
from
time
to
time
he
stood
up
and
tried
to
keep
himself
warm
by
exercising
his
arms
he
sang
or
more
often
took
up
afresh
upon
each
recovery
of
consciousness
a
verse
of
a
ballad
about
a
girl
so
true
that
he
wished
he
then
had
by
his
side
for
the
time
without
her
seemed
so
long
now
and
then
the
spray
of
a
sea
would
bring
him
more
sharply
to
himself
but
it
did
not
last
long
and
so
the
ditty
which
was
melancholy
to
the
last
degree
would
begin
afresh
salvé
was
far
too
restless
to
have
any
desire
to
sleep
and
as
he
paced
to
and
fro
by
the
lost
in
his
dreams
and
listened
to
the
song
it
seemed
to
him
a
most
touching
one
the
nodding
sailor
little
thought
that
he
was
performing
before
a
audience
chapter
the
party
meanwhile
that
had
left
the
ship
were
passing
the
night
with
old
jacob
on
torungen
they
had
tried
first
to
beat
out
to
the
larger
island
but
the
sea
had
risen
darkness
had
set
in
and
it
had
soon
become
evident
that
it
was
no
longer
for
a
boat
with
ladies
in
it
they
had
determined
therefore
rather
than
go
about
for
home
and
lose
the
whole
sporting
expedition
which
was
to
have
lasted
for
two
or
three
days
to
spend
the
night
on
little
torungen
and
see
what
the
morning
would
do
for
them
great
was
old
jacob
astonishment
it
may
readily
be
supposed
when
there
came
in
the
late
evening
a
knocking
at
the
door
and
he
saw
by
the
light
from
the
hearth
no
less
than
six
grand
folk
come
streaming
in
with
two
ladies
amongst
them
he
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
looked
at
them
in
mute
amazement
as
for
elizabeth
if
it
had
been
a
train
of
fairies
that
had
suddenly
appeared
they
could
not
have
occasioned
her
more
terror
and
curiosity
it
was
getting
near
bedtime
and
she
had
been
sitting
over
the
fire
and
perhaps
her
suddenly
awakened
excitement
lent
a
more
than
usual
animation
and
attraction
to
a
pair
of
eyes
and
a
face
that
would
nowhere
have
passed
unnoticed
for
carl
beck
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
party
seemed
positively
fascinated
and
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
until
reddening
with
confusion
she
instinctively
stretched
out
her
hand
for
her
bodice
that
lay
beside
her
on
the
bench
good
evening
jacob
old
boy
cried
carl
in
the
frank
manner
that
became
him
so
well
going
up
to
the
old
fellow
and
laying
his
hand
cordially
on
his
shoulder
i
afraid
we
shall
be
very
troublesome
to
you
such
a
large
party
but
we
want
you
to
let
us
stay
here
till
morning
till
we
see
if
the
weather
moderates
a
bit
we
dare
go
driving
out
in
the
dark
to
great
torungen
on
account
of
these
women
folk
that
we
have
on
board
and
he
pointed
jokingly
to
his
sister
and
her
friend
i
see
you
have
to
deal
with
womankind
too
so
you
know
what
it
is
the
old
man
was
apparently
not
insensible
to
this
genial
way
of
dealing
with
him
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
made
room
at
the
fire
begging
that
they
would
put
up
with
what
accommodation
he
had
to
offer
and
telling
elizabeth
at
the
same
time
to
go
out
for
more
wood
while
the
party
gathered
round
the
fire
and
made
themselves
as
comfortable
as
they
could
carl
beck
was
outside
with
the
boatmen
seeing
about
having
the
provisions
brought
up
he
came
in
again
with
elizabeth
also
with
an
armful
of
wood
throwing
it
down
laughing
he
cried
now
for
a
as
our
friends
the
swedes
have
it
but
first
out
with
the
food
there
was
no
scarcity
of
eatables
which
were
discussed
amid
a
running
fire
of
conversation
upon
every
kind
of
topic
and
then
came
the
bowl
a
composition
of
various
strong
and
spicy
ingredients
of
which
carl
had
the
secret
and
which
finally
was
lighted
and
ladled
into
the
glasses
whilst
the
blue
flame
was
burning
carl
beck
was
the
life
of
the
party
and
very
well
he
looked
as
he
sat
there
astride
over
the
bench
with
his
glass
in
his
hand
and
his
officer
jacket
with
its
thrown
open
and
sang
first
one
and
then
another
of
the
rollicking
that
were
then
in
vogue
the
others
joining
in
the
chorus
he
gave
them
then
a
cheery
which
brought
in
its
train
a
series
of
anecdotes
from
the
recent
war
old
jacob
under
the
influence
of
the
prevailing
and
the
good
cheer
had
become
uncommonly
lively
for
him
and
would
even
put
in
a
word
now
and
then
but
every
attempt
to
make
him
tell
a
story
himself
failed
only
when
the
action
at
the
heather
islands
came
up
for
discussion
for
a
while
did
he
come
out
with
a
bit
of
a
yarn
as
he
called
it
yes
he
said
putting
carefully
down
the
glass
that
was
handed
to
him
it
was
a
great
battle
was
that
the
country
lost
a
fine
ship
there
and
many
a
brave
lad
to
boot
but
god
curse
hangs
over
the
man
that
piloted
the
englishman
in
to
the
sand
islands
although
none
here
while
he
was
alive
knew
his
name
it
was
said
he
soon
after
made
an
end
of
himself
through
remorse
like
judas
iscariot
however
that
may
be
at
the
mouth
of
the
channel
there
is
a
flat
sunk
rock
that
a
man
in
his
can
stand
on
at
low
water
and
there
they
see
him
on
moonlight
nights
making
piteous
signs
for
help
until
the
water
at
last
comes
over
his
head
and
he
disappears
god
help
the
man
that
row
out
to
him
it
always
foul
weather
when
he
is
to
be
seen
have
you
ever
seen
him
yourself
jacob
asked
carl
beck
i
not
say
that
i
have
and
i
not
say
that
i
have
but
i
know
that
the
last
time
i
was
off
those
islands
we
had
such
tremendous
weather
that
we
thought
ourselves
lucky
in
making
any
port
at
all
for
a
while
every
one
was
busied
with
the
thoughts
which
jacob
recital
had
suggested
and
there
was
a
solemn
pause
which
was
broken
by
carl
beck
striking
up
another
song
to
keep
off
sleep
before
the
wind
and
a
flowing
sail

for
every
port
in
letters

a
dear

every

inwrought
the

may
sail
the
world
around
but
with
her
the
girls
will
still
be
found
hurrah
then
boys
for
the
one
of
your
mind
that
never
oh
never
you
leave
behind
he
repeated
the
last
couplet
with
a
gay
inclination
of
his
glass
to
the
ladies
who
were
sitting
now
tired
and
huddled
together
on
the
bench
and
over
their
heads
to
elizabeth
who
was
standing
in
the
background
awake
enough
for
both
of
them
the
light
from
the
fire
fell
upon
his
handsome
brown
face
with
the
raven
black
curly
hair
and
the
dark
eyes
that
it
was
said
he
had
inherited
from
his
recently
deceased
mother
who
was
from
brest
and
with
his
flow
of
animal
spirits
that
sufficed
for
the
whole
party
almost
he
certainly
was
as
manly
and
handsome
a
lad
as
you
would
wish
to
meet
the
wind
by
this
time
had
gone
down
considerably
and
as
day
was
breaking
the
whole
party
were
in
the
boat
once
more
and
enjoying
a
quiet
sleep
as
they
sailed
it
was
long
though
before
elizabeth
could
get
out
of
her
thoughts
the
handsome
young
officer
who
had
sat
there
by
the
fire
and
many
a
time
would
she
conjure
up
his
form
on
the
bench
again
particularly
as
he
looked
when
he
held
up
his
glass
and
glanced
over
to
her
while
he
sang
hurrah
then
boys
for
the
one
of
your
mind
that
never
oh
never
you
leave

this
carl
beck
made
repeated
excursions
out
to
torungen
to
shoot
and
by
preference
alone
in
his
but
whether
it
was
an
instinct
or
not
on
her
side
it
happened
somehow
that
he
never
had
any
further
conversation
with

the
juno
arrived
in
due
course
at
boston
where
salvé
invested
a
considerable
portion
of
his
wages
in
the
material
for
a
dress
a
couple
of
silk
handkerchiefs
and
two
massive
rings
with
his
own
and
elizabeth
initials
on
them
from
boston
she
proceeded
to
grimsby
with
a
canadian
cargo
then
on
a
short
trip
to
liverpool
then
back
to
quebec
and
some
ten
or
eleven
months
after
leaving
arendal
they
were
on
a
voyage
from
memel
in
the
baltic
to
new
york
with
a
cargo
of
timber
planks
and
the
intention
being
to
call
in
at
the
home
port
for
which
she
had
some
general
cargo
to
take
in
provisions
during
these
voyages
salvé
as
one
may
say
had
completed
his
apprenticeship
to
the
sea
and
in
his
blue
shirt
loosely
knotted
round
the
throat
his
leather
belt
and
canvas
trousers
he
had
such
a
look
of
smartness
and
energy
that
it
required
no
very
great
amount
of
discernment
to
perceive
in
him
a
sailor
from
top
to
toe
he
had
sooner
than
most
risen
superior
to
the
dangers
and
temptations
to
which
young
sailor
lads
are
exposed
during
the
years
of
their
novitiate
and
with
a
recklessness
of
disposition
he
combined
such
a
perfectly
activity
that
his
superior
smartness
was
recognised
even
among
his
comrades
his
bearing
it
is
true
was
rather
arrogant
and
his
tongue
not
the
most
but
he
was
generally
liked
nevertheless
for
he
was
if
he
was
only
taken
on
the
right
side
and
it
did
not
seem
to
be
his
qualities
upon
which
he
prided
himself
so
much
as
upon
the
superior
acuteness
of
his
understanding
which
he
delighted
to
display
in
discussions
with
the
and
somewhat
consequential
sailmaker
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
man
and
who
affected
a
proportionate
importance
up
at
memel
they
had
had
great
difficulties
to
contend
with
owing
to
the
condition
of
the
ice
and
their
bad
luck
seemed
to
be
going
to
follow
them
for
in
the
skager
rack
they
found
themselves
suddenly
wedged
into
a
field
of
with
the
prospect
of
having
to
remain
where
they
were
for
weeks
perhaps
the
cold
had
been
unusually
severe
that
winter
in
the
baltic
and
out
over
the
plain
of
ice
by
which
they
were
surrounded
they
could
see
flags
of
all
nations
sharing
a
similar
fate
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait
and
hope
and
if
the
ice
did
not
break
up
soon
short
rations
would
become
the
order
of
the
day
it
was
wearisome
and
to
salvé
above
all
who
was
feverishly
longing
to
get
home
and
whose
temperament
was
little
suited
for
the
endurance
of
such
agonies
of
tantalus
he
became
the
very
embodiment
of
restlessness
a
hundred
times
he
went
aloft
to
look
out
for
some
prospect
of
a
change
and
to
strain
his
eyes
after
the
streak
of
land
to
the
north
which
was
to
be
made
out
on
clear
days
from
the
and
which
of
course
would
be
the
coast
of
norway
the
dress
the
silk
handkerchiefs
the
rings
and
what
he
should
say
to
elizabeth
whether
he
should
formally
request
a
private
interview
with
her
or
wait
till
an
opportunity
offered
were
running
incessantly
in
his
head
and
particularly
what
he
should
say
to
her
seemed
now
often
as
he
had
thought
it
over
during
the
long
voyage
and
settled
it
to
his
satisfaction
to
present
many
points
of
difficulty
he
must
go
down
then
to
his
seaman
chest
and
see
if
the
things
were
still
there
all
right
and
whether
the
moths
might
not
have
got
into
them
the
last
inspection
when
he
unfolded
the
stuff
in
his
bunk
being
conducted
with
uncommon
precautions
at
last
there
came
a
prospect
of
release
in
the
shape
of
thick
weather
and
a
southerly
gale
setting
on
the
norwegian
coast
the
ice
too
had
for
a
day
or
two
previously
begun
to
show
blue
patches
of
water
here
and
there
and
when
it
was
dark
that
evening
they
felt
themselves
free
once
more
in
spite
of
the
salt
water
and
the
rain
which
he
had
to
wipe
off
his
face
every
minute
salvé
went
to
his
post
forward
that
night
and
stood
there
humming
to
himself
whilst
the
rest
of
the
crew
who
were
on
duty
slopped
up
and
down
on
the
below
in
and
dripping
oilskins
or
sheltered
themselves
as
best
they
could
under
the
lee
of
the
or
forecastle
they
had
been
hard
at
work
all
day
making
openings
in
the
ice
and
now
the
groaning
and
whistling
among
the
blocks
and
ropes
that
were
increasing
every
minute
gave
little
promise
of
rest
for
the
night
the
captain
stood
upon
the
poop
in
his
thick
overcoat
and
drenched
fur
cap
with
his
trumpet
under
his
arm
looking
anxiously
through
the
from
time
to
time
and
his
voice
sounded
unusually
stern
there
lay
before
him
in
the
dark
blustering
winter
night
a
veritable
david
choice
the
strong
southerly
current
aided
by
the
gale
was
fast
carrying
him
in
under
the
norwegian
coast
while
on
the
other
hand
if
he
tried
to
beat
to
windward
he
risked
coming
into
collision
with
the
added
to
that
he
was
not
very
clear
as
to
his
position
and
as
the
gale
increased
he
began
to
pace
restlessly
backwards
and
forwards
addressing
every
now
and
then
a
word
down
to
one
of
the
helmsmen
whose
forms
could
be
seen
by
the
gleam
from
the
binnacle
how
her
head
jens
sir
she
lay
no
higher
h
more
and
more
on
land
he
muttered
the
perspiration
coming
out
upon
his
forehead
under
his
fur
cap
which
in
spite
of
the
rain
he
had
to
push
back
to
get
air
both
life
and
ship
would
soon
be
at
stake
what
says
the
mate
he
asked
of
the
latter
who
came
up
the
steps
at
this
moment
from
taking
a
turn
forward
black
as
pitch
if
we
stuck
a
lantern
out
on
the
flying
we
should
see
that
far
at
any
rate
but
the
lead
gives
deep
water
does
it
was
the
rather
scornful
rejoinder
the
blockhead
does
seem
to
know
yet
growled
the
captain
as
the
other
turned
away
that
the
lead
will
give
you
deep
water
here
until
your
vessel
has
her
nose
upon
the
cliff
there
was
no
chance
of
a
pilot
on
such
a
night
as
this
promised
to
be
but
still
in
the
hope
that
the
wind
might
carry
the
sound
in
under
land
a
few
shots
were
fired
from
the
at
last
there
was
no
longer
any
choice
left
if
they
were
not
to
end
upon
the
rocks
that
night
they
must
crowd
on
more
sail
and
try
at
all
hazards
to
haul
off
the
coast
the
order
was
accordingly
given
to
shake
a
reef
out
followed
by
haul
in
the
topsail
clap
on
the
topsail
halyards
and
hoist
away
and
in
the
darkness
might
be
heard
occasionally
hoi
as
the
sailors
worked
at
the
tough
and
heavy
sail
with
the
cordage
all
stiff
and
swollen
with
ice
and
slippery
with
the
rain
the
spray
driving
in
their
faces
and
the
vessel
rolling
so
that
sometimes
they
were
hanging
on
by
the
ropes
only
when
the
deck
went
from
under
their
feet
under
the
fresh
weight
of
sail
the
vessel
careened
over
and
shot
foaming
forward
with
new
life
for
a
moment
the
next
the
topsail
had
burst
away
from
the
with
a
report
as
of
a
and
she
had
fallen
away
into
the
trough
of
the
sea
the
sheet
parted
at
the
same
time
and
a
deluge
of
water
carried
overboard
with
part
of
the
bulwarks
a
large
portion
of
the
deck
cargo
which
consisted
of
heavy
timber
leaving
the
remainder
tossed
about
in
the
wildest
confusion
and
much
of
it
standing
on
end
against
the
railings
and
capstan
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
be
brought
up
in
the
wind
again
and
the
old
juno
had
then
to
go
through
a
trial
such
as
her
joints
even
in
her
younger
days
had
never
been
equal
to
she
was
like
many
another
vessel
that
is
a
good
sailor
enough
a
little
from
the
weight
of
the
cargo
amidships
and
as
she
gave
to
the
strain
the
ladder
that
stood
in
the
hold
began
to
saw
up
and
down
in
the
coaming
forward
while
the
water
came
oozing
in
through
the
staring
bow
timbers
and
the
pumps
had
to
be
kept
continually
going
the
hatches
were
all
battened
down
and
many
of
the
crew
had
lashed
themselves
to
the
lower
rigging
as
preferable
now
to
the
deck
ready
about
tacks
and
sheets
luff
now
and
keep
her
close
to
the
wind
the
same
monotonous
words
of
command
all
through
the
night
every
time
they
lay
over
upon
a
new
tack
while
at
the
same
time
they
would
generally
ship
a
heavy
sea
and
the
vessel
would
shake
through
all
her
frame
day
broke
and
passed
in
a
fog
that
left
them
in
much
the
same
uncertainty
as
before
about
their
position
for
one
moment
it
had
lifted
and
they
fancied
they
had
seen
homborgsund
fald
a
high
landmark
up
the
country
above
arendal
and
from
its
lowness
and
dimness
on
the
horizon
they
had
been
encouraged
to
hope
that
they
had
appreciably
increased
their
distance
from
the
coast
about
noon
they
passed
an
english
brig
that
had
been
through
the
same
struggle
as
the
juno
was
now
engaged
upon
whose
signals
of
distress
they
had
already
occasionally
heard
faintly
upon
the
wind
and
which
now
seemed
on
the
point
of
foundering
the
crew
had
climbed
into
the
which
was
all
that
now
remained
standing
and
they
made
despairing
signs
for
help
but
it
was
impossible
to
render
any
they
had
enough
to
do
to
keep
themselves
afloat
the
gale
showed
no
signs
of
moderating
and
that
night
as
salvé
kristiansen
and
another
were
taking
their
turn
at
the
wheel
there
gleamed
suddenly
out
of
the
pitchy
darkness
to
leeward
of
the
the
white
crest
of
a
tremendous
eddy
wave
which
a
moment
after
came
crashing
down
upon
the
deck
carrying
clean
away
the
binnacle
and
damaging
the
wheel
and
leaving
many
of
the
drenched
and
half
suffocated
sailors
deposited
in
the
most
unexpected
places
and
only
glad
to
find
that
they
still
had
the
deck
under
them
ugly
sea
on
the
was
heard
again
from
forward
and
all
in
that
direction
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
a
mass
of
white
ready
about
hard
and
with
a
great
lurch
the
old
craft
went
about
once
more
the
renewed
shrieking
in
every
kind
of
pitch
in
the
rigging
and
the
blinding
dash
of
spray
showing
to
what
a
hurricane
the
gale
had
risen
salvé
had
been
too
much
occupied
with
the
damaged
wheel
at
first
to
have
a
thought
to
spare
for
anything
else
but
it
recurred
to
him
very
soon
that
when
that
first
dark
sea
had
broken
over
them
so
unexpectedly
from
leeward
he
had
seen
for
a
moment
the
glimmer
of
two
lights
on
its
crest
and
a
world
of
associations
was
at
once
aroused
in
his
mind
it
seemed
to
the
lad
romantic
fancy
that
he
was
keeping
an
appointment
with
elizabeth
raklev
as
he
glanced
hurriedly
back
the
two
again
appeared
he
had
seen
them
too
often
before
to
be
mistaken
and
he
shouted
over
his
shoulder
to
the
captain
who
noticed
them
now
for
the
first
time
those
lights
behind
to
leeward
are
from
old
jacob
hearth
on
torungen
are
you
sure
of
that
muttered
beck
coming
nearer
to
him
at
the
same
time
over
the
sloping
deck
with
the
help
of
a
rope
if
they
are
it
will
not
be
long
before
we
are
dashed
to
atoms
on
the
rocks
a
conversation
ensued
between
them
in
which
salvé
declared
that
he
had
known
the
water
under
torungen
from
childhood
as
well
as
he
did
his
father
garden
and
the
upshot
was
that
beck
pale
and
hesitating
determined
to
go
in
under
land
with
him
as
pilot
it
is
much
that
is
being
intrusted
this
night
to
two
young
shoulders
said
he
and
see
you
think
twice
young
man
both
for
your
own
sake
and
ours
they
kept
away
then
and
stood
in
under
land
with
the
least
sail
they
could
carry
in
the
tremendous
sea
that
was
now
breaking
in
their
wake
and
soon
the
thunder
of
the
breakers
became
audible
salvé
was
pale
but
perfectly
calm
as
he
stood
there
with
the
after
having
taken
over
the
command
and
with
the
captain
and
mate
by
his
side
but
all
of
a
sudden
great
beads
of
perspiration
came
out
on
his
forehead
there
was
something
curiously
irregular
about
the
light
it
had
become
dim
and
red
and
then
seemed
to
go
out
altogether
had
he
by
any
possibility
made
a
mistake
and
was
he
now
sailing
the
juno
with
all
on
board
straight
for
the
rocks
the
uncertainty
lasted
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
never
in
his
life
had
salvé
seen
so
heavy
a
countenance
as
that
with
which
beck
whose
expression
discovered
a
trace
of
doubt
looked
at
him
evidently
hesitating
whether
he
should
not
take
the
command
again
himself
but
in
the
mean
time
the
gleam
of
light
shone
forth
again
whatever
might
have
been
the
cause
of
its
obscuration
and
that
night
salvé
kristiansen
brought
the
juno
safely
into
merdö
chapter
vii
out
on
little
torungen
meanwhile
noteworthy
events
had
occurred
which
were
now
the
talk
of
the
town
old
jacob
had
had
a
stroke
the
week
before
and
had
died
the
same
night
the
juno
had
had
her
wrestle
for
life
in
the
preceding
two
days
of
fog
and
storm
they
had
heard
many
of
distress
and
his
granddaughter
had
during
that
time
kept
up
the
fire
alone
at
night
it
was
only
as
he
was
drawing
his
last
breath
and
she
sat
by
his
side
and
bent
over
him
forgetful
of
aught
else
that
it
was
for
a
while
neglected
and
it
was
this
little
moment
that
had
caused
salvé
such
a
quart
on
board
the
juno
on
the
following
day
in
her
despair
she
had
attempted
a
perilous
journey
over
the
drift
ice
to
bring
people
out
to
her
assistance
and
had
been
taken
up
by
a
boat
and
brought
in
by
it
to
arendal
the
poor
girl
was
far
too
much
occupied
with
her
grief
for
the
loss
of
her
grandfather
to
think
in
the
remotest
degree
of
making
her
story
interesting
but
carl
beck
in
his
enthusiasm
knew
very
well
how
to
give
the
incident
a
colouring
of
romance
and
she
was
very
soon
exalted
into
the
heroine
of
the
hour
it
was
talked
of
at
the
amtmand
a
house
with
two
handsome
daughters
where
lieutenant
beck
was
a
daily
visitor
and
it
was
in
everybody
mouth
how
all
alone
out
on
torungen
with
her
dying
grandfather
she
had
been
the
means
of
saving
the
juno
and
had
since
risked
her
life
on
the
ice
every
one
could
see
by
a
glance
at
her
that
she
must
have
a
remarkable
character
but
as
to
her
uncommon
beauty
there
prevailed
different
opinions
in
feminine
circles
it
was
at
all
events
a
pity
that
she
was
so
forlorn
and
the
becks
it
was
thought
were
now
morally
bound
to
look
after
her
for
the
present
she
had
gone
to
live
with
her
aunt
up
in
one
of
the
narrow
streets
at
the
back
of
the
town
and
there
came
pouring
in
with
and
without
the
owners
names
all
sorts
of
friendly
advice
with
black
dress
materials
and
ornaments
from
the
young
men
and
shop
lads
and
a
couple
of
the
bustling
ladies
of
the
town
even
came
in
person
to
see
her
aunt
and
talk
over
the
girl
future
when
carl
beck
however
gave
out
that
he
looked
upon
these
presents
as
slights
upon
himself
they
ceased
he
had
only
been
up
there
once
and
then
his
eldest
sister
was
with
him
but
his
manner
on
that
occasion
had
been
most
attractive
he
had
sympathised
with
such
winning
sincerity
and
at
the
same
time
so
unassumingly
in
elizabeth
grief
and
when
leaving
assured
her
with
emotion
which
he
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
that
they
owed
it
to
her
that
their
father
was
still
alive
when
he
was
gone
his
sister
had
proceeded
to
the
real
matter
of
her
visit
she
had
come
to
propose
to
the
aunt
that
elizabeth
should
live
with
them
for
the
present
with
the
view
of
qualifying
herself
for
a
housekeeper
place
as
she
must
not
be
exposed
to
the
necessity
of
going
out
as
a
common
it
was
her
brother
she
added
who
had
made
this
plan
for
elizabeth
future
the
offer
was
a
highly
desirable
one
for
persons
in
their
position
and
was
accepted
by
the
aunt
with
unmixed
satisfaction
over
face
however
there
passed
a
momentary
cloud
she
felt
without
knowing
why
a
sense
of
oppression
at
the
prospect
of
coming
into
closer
contact
with
the
young
lieutenant
but
at
the
same
time
she
would
not
for
a
great
deal
have
refused
the
offer
chapter
viii
as
for
salvé
during
the
first
few
days
after
coming
home
he
was
a
happy
man
he
was
in
love
he
had
received
from
his
captain
a
note
accompanied
by
a
promise
that
as
soon
as
he
had
learnt
navigation
he
should
be
third
mate
on
board
the
juno
and
he
heard
himself
admired
on
all
sides
by
his
equals
and
associates
there
was
so
much
work
to
be
done
though
in
discharging
the
cargo
and
getting
the
vessel
into
dock
for
repairs
they
had
managed
to
get
her
up
as
far
as
arendal
that
it
would
be
saturday
evening
before
he
could
get
his
so
on
the
day
before
as
he
was
sitting
on
watch
in
the
early
morning
under
the
lee
of
the
bulwark
he
accidentally
overheard
a
conversation
going
on
upon
the
slip
below
that
set
his
blood
on
fire
the
carpenters
had
just
come
to
their
work
and
one
of
them
was
telling
the
story
of
old
jacob
death
and
of
the
heroism
which
his
granddaughter
had
displayed
they
say
he
went
on
that
captain
beck
is
to
have
him
buried
on
monday
next
and
that
he
is
to
provide
for
the
granddaughter
the
navy
lieutenant
has
seen
to
that
the
noise
and
the
clinking
of
the
hammers
that
were
now
at
work
made
salvé
lose
a
good
deal
of
the
conversation
here
there
is
good
reason
for
that
mind
you
was
the
next
observation
he
caught
made
in
a
somewhat
lower
tone
and
accompanied
by
a
doubtful
laugh
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
he
has
been
out
so
constantly
shooting
about
torungen
would
she
be
a
of
that
feather
old
jacob
i
should
have
thought
was
not
the
kind
of
man
well
perhaps
not
that
altogether
but
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
come
straight
over
here
and
he
has
had
her
already
taken
into
his
own
house
i
have
that
from
the
aunt
the
old
woman
had
no
suspicion
of
anything
but
told
me
quite
innocently
that
now
she
was
to
be
a
sort
of
housekeeper
with
the
becks
a
slight
noise
above
him
here
caused
the
speaker
to
look
up
a
deadly
pale
young
sailor
was
staring
down
at
him
over
the
ship
side
with
a
pair
of
eyes
that
struck
him
as
resembling
those
he
had
once
seen
in
the
head
of
a
mad
dog
their
owner
turned
away
at
once
and
crossed
the
deck
that
must
have
been
the
lover
he
whispered
over
to
the
other
as
he
set
to
work
with
his
adze
upon
the
pencilled
plank
shortly
after
he
muttered
in
a
tone
of
compunction
if
i
saw
that
physiognomy
aright
some
one
had
better
take
care
of
himself
when
he
gets
leave
ashore
salvé
had
sprung
to
his
feet
in
a
fury
when
he
heard
about
young
beck
but
the
desire
to
hear
more
had
kept
him
spellbound
what
further
had
been
hinted
of
his
relations
with
elizabeth
and
that
the
latter
had
even
taken
refuge
in
his
house
seemed
all
only
too
probable
he
knew
both
the
men
who
had
been
speaking
they
were
respectable
folks
and
the
one
besides
had
had
the
news
from
the
aunt
herself
there
was
hard
work
that
day
on
board
but
his
hands
were
as
if
they
had
been
benumbed
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
give
any
assistance
except
in
appearance
when
any
hauling
was
to
be
done
he
did
everything
mechanically
are
you
sick
lad
or
longing
after
your
sweetheart
said
the
mate
to
him
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
he
saw
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
him
that
last
after
your
sweetheart
had
a
wonderfully
rousing
influence
he
felt
himself
all
at
once
relieved
of
his
heavy
feeling
of
exhaustion
and
worked
now
so
hard
that
the
perspiration
poured
down
his
face
joining
in
the
hauling
song
from
time
to
time
with
a
wild
unnatural
energy
he
was
afraid
to
leave
himself
a
moment
for
thought
when
the
day
was
over
however
he
took
the
anchor
watch
for
a
comrade
who
was
overjoyed
at
the
unexpected
prospect
of
getting
a
quiet
night
in
his
hammock
and
at
escaping
from
his
turn
of
ship
dog
that
watch
consisting
of
one
man
only
whose
business
it
is
to
keep
the
ship
from
he
paced
up
and
down
the
deck
alone
in
the
pitchy
darkness
that
was
only
relieved
by
a
lantern
or
two
out
in
the
harbour
and
a
light
here
and
there
up
in
the
town
sometimes
standing
for
long
minutes
together
with
his
cheek
on
his
hand
leaning
on
the
railing
he
could
without
the
slightest
scruple
murder
young
beck
that
he
felt
at
two
he
crossed
over
to
the
boards
that
were
sloped
against
the
vessel
side
slid
down
them
in
the
dark
to
the
slip
and
from
there
made
his
way
ashore
elizabeth
aunt
lived
in
one
of
the
small
houses
above
and
he
had
determined
to
wake
her
and
have
a
talk
with
her
widow
kirstine
was
a
portly
somewhat
worn
perhaps
but
otherwise
old
woman
with
a
good
broad
face
and
thin
grey
hair
drawn
down
behind
her
ears
she
was
not
unused
to
being
disturbed
at
night
one
of
her
occupations
being
to
nurse
sick
people
but
she
always
grumbled
whenever
she
was
when
she
held
up
the
candle
she
had
lit
and
recognised
salvé
kristiansen
she
thought
from
his
paleness
and
general
appearance
that
he
was
drunk
is
that
you
salvé
and
a
pretty
state
to
be
in
at
this
time
of
night
she
began
severely
in
the
doorway
not
caring
to
let
him
in
at
first
is
that
the
way
you
spend
your
wages
no
mother
it
not
i
come
off
my
watch
i
wanted
to
have
a
word
with
you
about
elizabeth
his
tone
was
so
strangely
low
and
sorrowful
that
the
old
woman
saw
that
there
must
be
something
unusual
the
matter
and
she
opened
the
door
about
elizabeth
you
say
yes
where
is
she
stopping
now
where
is
she
stopping
why
with
the
becks
of
course
is
there
anything
the
matter
you
ought
to
know
that
best
mother
kirstine
he
said
earnestly
she
held
up
the
light
to
his
face
and
looked
at
him
in
vague
anxiety
but
could
make
nothing
out
of
it
if
i
ought
to
know
it
tell
me
she
said
almost
in
a
tone
of
entreaty
young
beck
i
hear
has
been
out
about
torungen
the
whole
year
shooting
or
do
you
really
think
he
means
to
marry
her
he
broke
out
wildly
and
raising
his
voice
it
was
only
now
that
she
caught
his
full
meaning
and
setting
down
the
candlestick
hard
upon
the
table
she
dropped
into
the
chair
by
the
side
herself
so
that
is
what
they
are
saying
is
it
she
cried
at
last
her
first
fear
was
over
but
anger
had
succeeded
to
it
and
she
rose
now
from
her
seat
with
arms
akimbo
and
flashing
eyes
she
was
not
a
woman
to
offend
lightly
so
they
have
fastened
that
lie
upon
elizabeth
have
they
it
a
shame
for
them
so
it
is
and
you
salvé
can
soil
your
lips
with
it
let
me
just
tell
you
then
for
your
pains
that
the
becks
house
is
as
respectable
a
one
as
any
in
arendal
and
it
is
you
and
such
as
you
that
can
take
its
character
away
never
fear
but
elizabeth
shall
hear
every
word
of
your
precious
story
ay
and
the
captain
and
the
lieutenant
and
madam
beck
too
and
you
be
hunted
from
the
juno
like
a
dripping
cur
so
you
thought
that
elizabeth
was
to
be
beholden
to
the
lieutenant
for
a
character
dear
mother
kirstine
salvé
cried
interrupting
her
in
the
full
torrent
of
her
indignation
i
did
think
about
it
i
could
think
only
i
heard
anders
of
the
crag
down
on
the
slip
this
morning
say
it
all
so
confidently
anders
of
the
crag
so
it
was
from
him
you
heard
it
the
pitiful
wheedling
rascal
that
is
his
gratitude
i
suppose
for
my
being
with
his
wife
last
week
i
shall
know
where
to
find
him
but
the
receiver
in
the
like
is
no
better
than
the
stealer
she
resumed
indignantly
and
i
have
you
know
it
was
just
beck
own
daughter
who
came
here
and
offered
elizabeth
a
respectable
place
in
a
respectable
house
and
it
was
to
me
she
talked
my
lad
pointing
with
quivering
forefinger
at
her
own
bosom
so
elizabeth
has
not
begged
herself
in
there
at
all
you
did
need
to
desert
your
watch
to
bring
such
tales
here
and
elizabeth
shall
hear
of
it
that
she
shall
she
repeated
excitedly
striking
one
hand
into
the
other
with
a
loud
smack
she
shall
hear
what
fine
faith
you
have
in
her
dear
mother
kirstine
i
did
mean
any
harm
he
said
entreatingly
feeling
as
if
a
weight
had
been
taken
off
his
heart
only
please
tell
elizabeth
you
may
depend
upon
it
i
will
mother
kirstine
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
looking
down
i
brought
a
dress
with
me
for
her
that
i
had
bought
in
boston
and
then
i
heard
all
this
and
i
could
contain
myself
he
said
nothing
about
the
rings
so
rejoined
the
old
woman
after
a
pause
during
which
she
had
examined
him
through
her
eyes
and
in
a
somewhat
milder
tone
so
you
brought
a
dress
for
her
and
at
the
same
time
you
come
running
up
here
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
tell
me
that
she
has
become
a
common
baggage
for
the
lieutenant
and
her
anger
rose
again
but
mother
kirstine
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
it
was
to
tell
me
that
i
suppose
you
came
up
here
in
such
haste
my
lad
i
was
only
mad
to
think
such
a
thing
could
be
said
of
her
well
be
off
with
you
now
anders
of
the
crag
shall
go
farther
with
his
lie
if
i
go
with
him
before
the
foged
and
the
maritime
court
for
the
matter
of
that
she
might
as
well
have
threatened
to
go
with
him
to
the
moon
but
salvé
understood
her
to
mean
by
the
maritime
court
the
bloodiest
course
she
knew
as
she
opened
the
door
to
let
him
out
she
said
with
a
certain
confidential
seriousness
tell
me
salvé
has
anything
passed
between
you
and
elizabeth
he
seemed
uncertain
for
a
moment
what
reply
he
should
make
to
this
unexpected
invitation
of
confidence
at
length
he
said
i
do
know
mother
kirstine
for
certain
two
years
ago
i
made
her
a
present
of
a
pair
of
shoes
you
did
well
see
now
and
get
on
board
again
without
any
one
noticing
you
that
my
advice
she
replied
without
allowing
herself
to
be
brought
any
further
into
the
matter
and
pushed
him
then
rather
unceremoniously
out
of
the
door
after
he
had
gone
she
sat
for
a
while
with
the
light
in
her
lap
staring
at
it
and
nodding
her
head
reflectively
he
a
good
and
a
handsome
lad
that
salvé
she
said
at
last
aloud
but
on
the
whole
it
will
be
better
to
tell
elizabeth
and
then
she
can
be
on
her
guard
there
in
the
house
and
having
come
to
this
decision
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
prepared
to
go
to
bed
again
salvé
notwithstanding
this
interview
was
far
from
being
at
ease
next
day
and
he
felt
the
courage
he
had
mustered
up
to
go
straight
to
elizabeth
with
the
dress
and
ring
altogether
gone
in
the
evening
when
all
the
crew
were
given
leave
from
the
ship
for
three
weeks
he
went
off
to
his
father
instead
to
see
if
he
could
learn
more
of
the
situation
through
inquiries
from
him
and
on
the
following
monday
both
were
present
at
old
jacob
interment
in
tromö
churchyard
chapter
ix
all
these
events
had
come
upon
elizabeth
with
overwhelming
suddenness
it
seemed
to
her
like
a
confused
dream
yet
the
fact
remained
that
there
she
was
dressed
in
black
an
inmate
of
one
of
those
handsome
houses
the
interiors
of
which
she
had
so
often
pictured
to
herself
out
on
torungen
captain
beck
was
married
to
a
second
wife
a
woman
of
stern
principles
full
of
decision
and
respectability
who
had
brought
him
a
considerable
fortune
and
under
her
rule
had
restored
that
order
in
household
matters
which
during
the
period
her
husband
was
a
widower
had
been
far
too
much
neglected
and
though
his
power
might
still
be
absolute
on
board
the
juno
it
had
long
since
ceased
to
be
so
in
his
own
house
by
her
madam
beck
was
in
the
highest
degree
respected
though
not
exactly
loved
owing
to
the
various
unaccustomed
restraints
to
which
they
now
found
themselves
subjected
and
as
to
carl
his
easy
tact
notwithstanding
the
independent
position
which
he
enjoyed
in
his
home
as
salaried
member
of
a
coast
commission
enabled
him
to
keep
on
the
best
of
terms
with
his
imperious
stepmother
his
duties
would
detain
him
about
home
for
another
year
to
be
still
fêted
by
the
town
and
idolised
by
his
sisters
who
were
never
tired
of
speculating
upon
eligible
matches
for
him
from
the
very
first
elizabeth
who
in
her
utter
ignorance
how
to
behave
committed
one
egregious
blunder
after
another
had
perceived
with
her
strong
sense
that
it
would
require
all
the
cleverness
and
patience
she
possessed
to
enable
her
to
maintain
the
situation
and
she
began
by
following
madam
beck
about
untiringly
like
a
lamb
many
a
painful
scene
had
she
to
go
through
during
the
earlier
period
of
their
connection
and
she
bore
them
with
a
quiet
gentleness
which
madam
beck
took
for
modest
docility
but
which
had
its
real
origin
in
a
fixed
determination
to
succeed
every
now
and
then
however
she
would
give
it
up
as
hopeless
and
would
seat
herself
disconsolately
by
the
window
with
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
and
gaze
wistfully
out
over
the
harbour
she
longed
so
for
cold
fresh
air
and
would
end
by
throwing
up
the
window
and
stretching
herself
with
her
heated
face
as
far
out
of
it
as
she
possibly
could
till
madam
beck
would
come
in
and
in
a
stern
voice
call
her
back
madam
beck
in
her
irritation
used
to
say
that
it
was
almost
as
if
they
had
taken
a
wild
thing
into
the
house
carl
beck
understood
very
well
what
she
was
going
through
and
would
occasionally
throw
her
an
encouraging
look
but
elizabeth
affected
always
not
to
understand
it
on
one
occasion
however
when
she
was
corrected
in
his
presence
she
hurriedly
left
the
room
and
throwing
herself
on
her
bed
lay
there
and
sobbed
as
if
her
heart
would
break
she
had
been
trusted
one
afternoon
shortly
after
to
bring
in
the
on
which
without
thinking
what
she
was
doing
she
had
placed
the
with
the
boiling
teakettle
it
fell
as
she
was
carrying
it
in
but
although
its
hot
side
and
the
boiling
water
burnt
and
scalded
her
arm
and
hand
she
carried
the
tray
quite
quietly
out
again
without
allowing
a
muscle
of
her
face
to
change
she
was
not
going
to
be
corrected
before
him
again
madam
beck
herself
bound
up
her
hand
in
the
kitchen
where
she
stood
white
with
pain
while
carl
who
had
been
sitting
on
the
sofa
and
had
seen
how
the
whole
thing
happened
forgetting
his
had
jumped
up
in
great
excitement
and
had
shown
such
uncommon
sympathy
that
his
sister
mina
afterwards
when
they
were
alone
in
the
room
together
said
with
a
look
that
was
more
searching
than
the
joking
words
seemed
to
require
it
is
not
possible
you
are
fond
of
the
girl
carl
no
fear
mina
he
answered
quickly
in
the
same
tone
chucking
her
under
the
chin
as
he
spoke
there
are
as
handsome
girls
as
her
in
arendal
but
you
can
see
as
well
as
i
can
that
she
is
a
girl
in
a
hundred
that
business
with
the
is
what
very
few
others
would
have
been
capable
of
and
we
must
forget
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
oh
yes
rejoined
mina
with
a
toss
of
her
head
a
little
tired
of
the
eternal
repetition
of
this
stock
observation
she
did
know
all
the
same
that
it
was
papa
who
was
out
there
it
was
a
game
of
hypocrisy
thought
out
with
no
inconsiderable
subtlety
that
the
handsome
lieutenant
was
carrying
on
in
this
matter
under
his
apparently
so
entirely
frank
there
was
hidden
a
real
diplomatist
by
trumpeting
about
the
town
the
service
which
elizabeth
had
rendered
them
in
saving
the
juno
he
had
one
may
say
forced
his
family
to
take
her
up
though
to
them
he
made
it
appear
that
public
opinion
left
them
no
alternative
on
the
other
hand
he
was
uncommonly
cautious
in
his
attitude
towards
elizabeth
herself
for
he
knew
he
must
win
her
without
attracting
the
attention
of
his
stepmother
and
sisters
he
believed
he
had
made
a
sort
of
impression
upon
her
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
that
he
had
a
wild
swan
to
deal
with
that
might
at
any
moment
spread
its
wings
and
fly
away
there
was
such
a
strong
independent
individuality
about
her
in
his
home
however
she
had
become
a
different
creature
scarcely
to
be
recognised
as
the
same
elizabeth
so
quietly
did
she
go
about
hardly
conscious
of
his
presence
apparently
and
so
slavishly
did
she
follow
the
directions
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
this
new
aspect
of
her
had
put
him
in
doubt
for
a
while
but
it
was
not
very
long
before
he
satisfied
himself
that
he
understood
what
it
meant
and
that
little
affair
with
the
that
was
set
down
to
awkwardness
by
the
others
had
quite
a
different
significance
for
him
he
flattered
himself
that
she
subjected
herself
to
all
this
restraint
for
his
sake
and
whatever
the
might
be
the
situation
was
at
all
events
an
interesting
one
but
there
was
on
the
other
hand
something
in
her
manner
that
kept
him
at
a
certain
distance
and
left
him
in
uncertainty
as
to
what
line
exactly
he
should
take
the
same
had
been
the
case
whenever
they
had
been
together
out
on
the
island
and
had
in
fact
been
the
principal
cause
of
his
becoming
more
deeply
in
love
with
her
every
day
he
had
once
out
there
encountered
a
look
in
her
eyes
which
had
given
him
the
impression
that
the
opinion
she
entertained
of
him
could
in
a
moment
be
reversed
and
that
least
of
all
dare
he
allow
her
to
feel
that
he
was
appearing
in
the
character
of
a
lover
and
it
was
for
this
reason
he
had
scarcely
ever
talked
with
her
grandfather
and
only
casually
with
herself
the
fact
was
old
jacob
had
very
well
understood
that
the
smart
young
did
not
come
out
there
for
his
sake
and
as
he
could
not
very
well
shut
the
door
in
his
face
he
had
very
sensibly
warned
his
granddaughter
against
him
he
explained
to
her
that
people
of
his
class
were
not
in
the
habit
of
marrying
a
common
man
child
although
it
happened
far
too
often
that
they
might
play
at
love
with
them
such
a
lad
as
salvé
kristiansen
now
he
remarked
in
conclusion
that
is
the
sort
of
stuff
that
will
not
disappoint
you
and
he
thought
he
had
played
the
diplomatist
there
with
some
skill
i
did
understand
you
to
mean
that
exactly
grandfather
that
time
you
were
going
to
beat
him
she
said
the
old
man
was
rather
nonplussed
for
the
moment
but
he
growled
out
something
about
youngsters
requiring
correction
occasionally
and
went
on
he
a
god
lad
i
tell
you
and
if
he
came
and
made
up
to
you
he
should
have
you
without
a
moment
hesitation
and
then
i
should
be
easy
in
my
mind
as
to
what
would
become
of
you
when
i
gone
elizabeth
made
no
further
observation
but
a
certain
expression
about
her
mouth
seemed
to
denote
that
she
reserved
to
herself
the
liberty
to
have
an
opinion
of
her
own
in
this
matter
salvé
kristiansen
had
been
very
dear
to
her
as
the
only
friend
and
confidant
she
had
ever
had
but
since
she
had
seen
the
lieutenant
it
had
been
he
who
had
exclusively
occupied
her
thoughts
all
that
had
formed
the
ideal
of
her
young
enthusiasm
had
suddenly
in
his
person
appeared
upon
the
rock
but
whether
it
was
his
uniform
or
the
bravery
of
the
fleet
or
himself
that
was
the
object
of
her
admiration
she
had
never
asked
herself
until
hurt
and
rendered
thoughtful
by
that
warning
of
her
grandfather
now
it
was
unmistakably
himself
the
handsome
brilliant
embodiment
of
it
all
but
at
the
same
time
there
sprang
up
in
her
nature
an
unconquerable
feeling
of
pride
in
obedience
to
the
dictates
of
which
she
absolutely
resigned
him
though
still
retaining
her
enthusiastic
admiration
and
it
was
this
double
attitude
of
mind
which
her
eyes
expressed
and
which
puzzled
her
admirer
when
she
heard
afterwards
from
her
aunt
in
arendal
that
people
had
been
talking
about
them
she
felt
it
deeply
and
more
than
ever
then
had
become
sensible
that
there
was
an
invisible
barrier
between
them
carl
father
meanwhile
had
been
trudging
daily
over
to
the
to
see
after
the
juno
which
had
had
to
have
her
bottom
scraped
her
gaping
seams
caulked
and
to
undergo
a
general
repair
he
was
hardly
at
home
to
meals
it
was
a
case
of
urgency
as
the
delivery
of
her
cargo
at
its
destination
could
not
be
delayed
beyond
a
certain
time
about
a
month
after
elizabeth
had
come
into
captain
beck
house
the
juno
was
ready
for
sea
again
and
carl
sister
came
into
the
room
smiling
one
day
then
and
said
elizabeth
there
is
a
young
sailor
out
in
the
porch
who
wants
to
speak
to
you
he
has
a
parcel
under
his
arm
perhaps
it
is
a
present
elizabeth
who
was
bringing
in
the
at
the
time
turned
red
and
carl
beck
who
was
standing
by
the
window
a
little
pale
she
knew
very
well
that
it
was
salvé
and
for
a
moment
she
was
almost
frightened
at
his
audacity
she
had
seen
him
a
couple
of
times
before
and
had
allowed
him
to
feel
that
she
was
not
particularly
anxious
for
his
company
in
consequence
of
what
her
aunt
had
told
her
and
as
she
went
out
to
see
him
now
she
trembled
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
or
two
without
saying
a
word
will
you
take
this
dress
elizabeth
he
said
at
last
almost
harshly
no
that
i
wo
salvé
such
things
as
you
have
been
saying
about
me
so
you
wo
take
it
he
said
slowly
and
dejectedly
it
is
no
use
saying
anything
more
then
i
suppose
no
salvé
it
is
no
use
saying
anything
more
the
desolate
expression
of
his
face
as
he
stood
and
looked
at
her
while
he
asked
am
i
to
take
it
to
sea
with
me
elizabeth
went
to
her
heart
and
the
tears
rushed
into
her
eyes
she
shook
her
head
negatively
but
with
an
almost
despairing
look
and
disappeared
into
the
house
they
could
see
in
the
that
she
had
been
crying
but
carl
beck
was
a
man
and
merely
lay
at
the
window
and
looked
out
after
his
rival
to
see
if
he
had
the
parcel
under
his
arm
as
he
went
out
of
the
gate
that
night
elizabeth
lay
awake
she
had
cried
in
her
sleep
and
had
dreamed
that
she
had
seen
salvé
standing
down
at
the
quay
so
wretchedly
clothed
and
so
miserable
but
too
proud
to
ask
assistance
of
any
one
and
that
he
had
given
her
such
a
bitterly
reproachful
look
and
she
lay
tossing
about
unable
to
get
the
dream
out
of
her
head
presently
there
came
the
noise
of
a
riotous
mob
outside
and
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
the
police
were
taking
some
one
with
them
down
the
street
as
they
passed
she
saw
by
the
light
of
the
for
a
moment
that
it
was
salvé
he
was
resisting
with
all
his
might
pale
and
infuriated
with
his
blue
shirt
all
torn
open
in
the
front
and
there
was
an
expression
in
his
face
that
at
any
rate
she
slept
no
more
that
night
there
had
been
a
general
she
heard
next
morning
among
the
sailors
over
in
mother
andersen
on
the
other
side
of
the
harbour
it
was
said
that
knives
had
been
used
and
that
salvé
kristiansen
had
been
the
originator
of
the
whole
disturbance
without
a
shadow
of
protest
carl
beck
said
and
proceeded
then
to
put
various
interpretations
of
his
own
upon
the
affair
elizabeth
left
the
room
and
for
some
days
after
was
pale
and
and
more
than
usually
reserved
carl
thought
in
her
attitude
towards
himself
captain
beck
had
paid
salvé
fine
and
procured
his
release
and
the
afternoon
before
the
juno
was
to
sail
his
father
and
younger
brother
came
on
board
to
say
to
him
there
was
something
strange
in
his
manner
that
struck
them
both
it
was
as
if
he
thought
he
would
never
see
them
again
he
offered
his
father
his
note
and
when
the
latter
would
not
take
it
made
him
promise
at
all
events
to
keep
it
for
him
the
father
attributed
his
unusual
manner
to
distress
of
mind
and
depression
on
account
of
his
recent
adventure
with
the
police
but
as
he
was
going
ashore
he
said
in
rather
a
husky
voice
remember
salvé
that
you
have
an
old
father
expecting
you
at
home
that
evening
and
a
great
part
of
the
night
salvé
passed
in
the
maintop
gazing
over
at
beck
house
as
long
as
there
was
a
light
in
the
attic
window
and
when
that
went
out
it
seemed
as
if
something
had
been
extinguished
in
himself
with
it
chapter
x
the
outer
side
of
tromö
which
lies
off
the
entrance
to
arendal
has
only
the
ordinary
barren
appearance
of
the
rest
of
the
islands
along
the
coast
a
wooden
church
with
a
little
belfry
like
a
and
serving
as
a
landmark
which
lies
drearily
down
by
the
sea
and
under
which
on
sundays
a
or
two
may
be
seen
while
service
is
going
on
is
the
only
feature
for
the
eye
to
rest
upon
the
land
side
of
the
island
on
the
contrary
presents
a
scene
all
the
richer
and
livelier
for
the
contrast
the
narrow
tromö
sound
with
its
swarm
of
small
coasters
lighters
and
vessels
of
larger
build
suns
itself
there
between
fertile
or
wooded
slopes
and
ridges
over
which
are
scattered
in
every
direction
the
red
cottages
of
the
sailor
population
skippers
houses
and
villas
and
in
every
available
spot
in
every
creek
or
bay
where
there
is
barely
room
for
a
vessel
the
white
timbers
of
ships
in
course
of
construction
come
into
view
it
is
an
idyllic
dockyard
a
very
beautiful
and
very
appropriate
approach
to
norway
principal
seaport
town
and
whoever
steams
up
it
on
a
still
summer
day
must
enjoy
a
surprise
that
will
not
easily
be
effaced
from
his
recollection
at
the
period
of
our
story
indeed
the
picture
was
far
from
being
so
complete
or
rich
but
even
then
were
becoming
manifest
the
germs
of
the
bustle
and
life
which
now
pervade
the
place
on
one
of
the
most
beautiful
points
of
the
sound
peeped
into
view
a
small
house
with
two
attic
windows
projecting
from
its
steep
tiled
roof
and
with
a
climbing
the
hillside
behind
which
was
the
property
of
captain
beck
and
here
until
as
he
proposed
to
do
in
a
couple
of
years
time
he
retired
from
the
sea
and
invested
his
fortune
in
the
shipbuilding
yard
which
he
had
in
view
his
family
generally
took
up
their
residence
during
the
summer
months
hither
in
the
early
part
of
this
summer
too
they
had
repaired
it
was
no
life
of
idleness
though
which
they
lived
out
there
madam
beck
always
made
work
for
everybody
and
had
her
own
in
the
her
had
his
occupation
on
land
and
as
much
as
he
could
do
as
member
of
the
coast
commission
but
he
used
generally
to
come
over
on
saturdays
in
his
pretty
and
remain
over
sunday
and
on
that
day
too
some
one
or
other
family
of
their
acquaintance
in
the
town
would
make
them
an
object
for
a
pleasure
party
and
would
usually
spend
the
afternoon
with
them
carl
beck
was
always
in
great
force
on
these
occasions
his
brown
face
and
frank
sailor
bearing
and
good
looks
would
have
been
sufficient
in
themselves
to
make
him
a
favourite
with
the
ladies
but
in
addition
to
these
claims
upon
their
interest
he
had
been
known
to
most
of
the
younger
ones
among
them
from
his
schoolboy
days
when
he
used
to
come
home
on
leave
as
a
cadet
and
he
seemed
to
enjoy
particular
confidential
relations
with
nearly
every
one
of
them
or
at
all
events
to
be
in
possession
of
some
secret
or
other
which
only
they
two
knew
they
had
all
kinds
of
jokes
and
expressions
from
their
younger
days
which
were
unintelligible
to
the
rest
and
what
is
vulgarly
called
chaff
formed
perhaps
the
staple
of
his
conversation
with
them
varied
now
and
then
by
a
touch
of
sentiment
which
was
intended
by
chance
as
it
were
to
open
up
to
them
for
a
moment
the
real
deeper
nature
which
they
might
not
have
suspected
him
of
possessing
they
used
to
twit
him
about
his
inclination
to
stoutness
and
he
used
to
joke
about
it
too
and
say
he
had
too
good
a
time
of
it
among
the
becks
most
frequent
visitors
out
there
was
postmaster
forstberg
family
which
included
besides
the
parents
a
hobbledehoy
son
and
their
daughter
marie
a
girl
some
eighteen
years
of
age
of
quiet
manners
and
with
an
uncommonly
clever
face
nobody
said
that
she
was
pretty
but
nearly
every
one
who
knew
her
had
the
impression
that
she
was
and
there
was
a
certain
indefinable
harmony
and
grace
not
only
about
her
perhaps
rather
small
figure
but
about
everything
she
did
but
if
she
was
not
considered
pretty
it
was
agreed
on
all
sides
that
she
had
great
sense
and
among
her
friends
she
was
always
the
one
they
elected
to
confide
in
whenever
they
had
anything
on
their
minds
that
she
never
confided
anything
to
them
in
return
had
curiously
enough
never
struck
them
and
for
that
matter
she
was
too
correct
and
proper
they
imagined
to
have
any
heart
affairs
herself
she
was
a
confidential
friend
of
carl
beck
sisters
and
especially
of
mina
who
declared
that
she
put
her
before
all
the
rest
of
her
acquaintance
and
thought
in
her
own
heart
that
she
was
exactly
the
match
for
her
brother
the
only
one
of
the
young
girls
in
the
circle
with
whom
carl
beck
had
had
no
youthful
acquaintance
was
marie
forstberg
and
it
had
been
some
time
before
he
discovered
that
the
quiet
girl
was
worth
talking
to
he
used
to
be
secretly
annoyed
then
that
the
conversation
when
she
was
present
should
lapse
so
easily
into
empty
trifling
her
mind
was
so
clear
and
true
and
she
had
such
a
beautiful
smile
for
whatever
she
approved
before
her
therefore
he
always
displayed
now
the
broad
manly
side
of
his
character
which
he
could
do
with
so
much
grace
and
the
coquetry
which
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
was
not
without
its
effect
she
had
always
made
rather
a
hero
of
him
in
her
own
mind
and
he
had
created
the
flattering
impression
now
that
the
light
and
flirting
manner
which
he
adopted
towards
young
ladies
and
which
had
rather
qualified
her
admiration
of
him
had
been
due
to
his
not
having
before
found
among
them
any
one
that
was
worthy
of
a
man
serious
attention
he
had
begun
consequently
to
occupy
a
much
larger
share
of
her
thoughts
than
she
would
herself
have
been
willing
to
acknowledge
and
many
of
the
confidences
of
which
she
was
the
recipient
at
this
time
would
if
her
friends
had
had
a
little
more
penetration
have
been
brought
last
of
all
to
her
marie
forstberg
attention
had
very
soon
been
attracted
to
elizabeth
and
knowing
her
history
she
tried
very
often
to
help
her
and
put
her
in
the
right
way
of
doing
things
at
first
she
found
her
rather
short
and
unapproachable
and
could
get
nothing
but
yes
or
no
from
her
and
there
was
something
almost
offensive
in
the
brusque
way
in
which
she
would
turn
with
an
impatient
flush
from
her
mentor
when
she
sometimes
did
understand
what
was
meant
and
would
do
the
thing
in
her
own
way
she
would
see
at
first
the
various
little
good
turns
which
the
other
did
her
in
her
quiet
considerate
way
but
they
were
acknowledged
at
last
with
a
look
that
made
amends
for
all
her
former
obtuseness
and
in
spite
of
their
different
natures
and
unequal
social
position
these
two
women
soon
came
to
feel
if
not
exactly
drawn
to
one
another
mutually
interested
in
each
other
at
the
same
time
as
elizabeth
was
not
blind
to
the
diplomacy
of
the
house
she
had
soon
perceived
that
of
all
the
young
ladies
who
came
there
marie
forstberg
was
the
one
who
had
the
best
chance
and
who
indeed
best
deserved
to
be
the
young
bride
and
although
she
tried
to
believe
that
she
was
merely
a
resigned
herself
she
seemed
to
feel
every
sunday
when
marie
forstberg
came
that
a
certain
disagreeable
impression
had
grown
up
in
her
mind
about
her
during
the
week
which
it
took
some
time
to
thaw
when
it
did
thaw
however
which
in
time
it
always
did
she
would
feel
attracted
to
her
with
redoubled
warmth
and
though
their
conversation
might
be
ostensibly
occupied
only
with
such
subjects
as
laying
the
table
or
dishing
the
dinner
she
would
contrive
to
introduce
into
it
anything
and
everything
concerning
the
lieutenant
which
she
thought
might
interest
or
recommend
him
to
her
friend
marie
forstberg
could
help
sometimes
fixing
her
clear
blue
eyes
searchingly
upon
her
to
ascertain
if
there
was
not
some
object
underlying
this
communicativeness
but
elizabeth
would
look
so
unconscious
as
she
stood
there
with
her
sleeves
tucked
up
busy
with
her
work
that
she
dismissed
the
idea
from
her
mind
in
this
country
life
although
without
a
moment
to
call
her
own
elizabeth
felt
freer
at
all
events
than
she
had
done
in
the
town
and
she
had
made
such
rapid
progress
under
madam
beck
tuition
that
the
latter
supervision
was
in
many
things
no
longer
required
one
part
in
particular
the
one
which
she
might
have
been
expected
to
find
the
most
difficult
of
all
that
of
she
filled
to
perfection
and
her
upright
figure
and
expressive
face
attracted
many
an
admiring
glance
on
sundays
when
in
her
becoming
striped
chintz
dress
and
white
apron
and
with
her
luxuriant
hair
turned
up
in
the
simplest
manner
she
carried
the
tea
or
coffee
things
out
to
the
guests
in
the
she
could
feel
that
carl
beck
eyes
were
never
off
her
as
long
as
she
was
in
sight
and
she
seemed
to
know
that
it
was
she
whom
his
eye
wandered
in
search
of
first
whenever
he
came
home
in
a
hundred
small
ways
he
made
her
conscious
of
the
interest
which
he
felt
in
her
and
whenever
there
was
a
commission
to
be
particularly
remembered
he
never
gave
it
to
his
sisters
alone
but
to
her
also
his
pretty
a
long
light
yawl
with
a
red
stripe
along
its
black
side
and
two
sloping
masts
which
he
had
lately
had
built
lay
often
the
whole
week
through
moored
in
the
bay
under
the
house
he
was
very
particular
about
the
boat
and
during
his
absence
it
was
to
elizabeth
sole
care
that
she
was
intrusted
there
was
always
something
or
other
to
be
looked
after
and
when
he
came
home
he
would
generally
subject
her
in
a
jokingly
harsh
tone
to
an
examination
which
he
called
holding
a
summary
sometimes
on
saturdays
he
would
come
up
the
path
waving
in
his
hand
a
letter
covered
with
it
would
be
from
his
father
to
his
stepmother
and
madam
beck
would
generally
read
it
by
herself
first
and
then
it
would
be
read
aloud
elizabeth
listening
with
strained
attention
she
was
always
so
afraid
that
there
might
be
something
bad
about
salvé
one
sunday
she
remarked
that
carl
wore
in
the
buttonhole
of
his
uniform
a
wild
flower
which
she
had
thrown
away
it
might
have
been
the
purest
accident
but
she
knew
that
he
had
seen
her
with
it
in
her
hand
the
same
day
they
had
wild
strawberries
at
dinner
and
there
were
no
strangers
and
he
broke
out
all
in
a
moment
yes
i
sooner
ten
thousand
times
have
wild
strawberries
than
garden
ones
they
have
quite
another
taste
and
smell
it
was
a
natural
remark
for
any
one
to
make
but
she
thought
he
had
looked
with
peculiar
earnestness
at
her
as
he
made
it
and
afterwards
he
had
fixed
his
eyes
upon
his
plate
for
a
long
while
without
raising
them
she
felt
that
the
remark
had
been
meant
for
her
and
altogether
that
day
there
was
something
about
him
that
made
her
uneasy
he
gazed
at
her
so
often
madame
beck
happened
to
have
just
then
a
long
list
of
household
necessaries
required
from
arendal
and
carl
said
that
if
some
one
would
go
with
him
in
the
boat
the
next
morning
to
help
him
with
the
parcels
he
would
execute
her
commissions
himself
when
madame
beck
suggested
elizabeth
he
eagerly
assented
but
the
colour
rushed
into
cheeks
and
with
an
angry
toss
of
her
head
which
she
did
make
any
attempt
to
conceal
she
left
the
room
as
he
was
standing
alone
outside
some
little
time
after
she
came
up
to
him
and
said
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
i
do
go
into
arendal
with
you
herr
beck
no
and
why
not
elizabeth
he
asked
with
affected
indifference
and
trying
to
meet
her
look
i
do
go
she
repeated
her
voice
trembling
with
pride
and
anger
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
and
she
turned
from
him
and
left
him
gazing
after
her
partly
in
confusion
and
partly
in
admiration
of
the
magnificently
proud
way
in
which
she
crossed
the
turf
to
the
house
again
the
expedition
was
given
up
and
in
spite
of
carl
it
came
out
inadvertently
that
it
was
on
account
of
elizabeth
having
refused
to
go
alone
in
the
boat
with
him
which
madam
beck
found
very
commendable
on
her
part
indeed
she
ought
to
have
known
herself
she
said
that
it
was
scarcely
proper
but
at
the
same
time
she
was
decidedly
of
opinion
that
the
more
becoming
course
for
elizabeth
would
have
been
to
speak
to
her
mistress
first
chapter
xi
the
house
in
the
town
was
undergoing
repairs
this
year
which
kept
the
family
out
in
the
country
until
rather
late
in
the
autumn
but
the
glorious
september
days
prolonged
the
summer
and
they
could
still
sit
out
on
the
steps
in
the
evening
and
enjoy
the
beauty
and
the
sentiment
of
the
season
and
the
rich
variety
of
the
autumn
tints
reflected
on
the
still
waters
of
the
sound
the
members
of
carl
commission
with
their
president
were
invited
out
there
one
day
and
it
was
made
a
great
occasion
all
the
resources
of
the
house
being
brought
into
requisition
to
do
them
honour
carl
although
the
youngest
member
of
the
commission
and
really
only
included
in
it
to
make
up
the
required
number
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
distinguish
himself
upon
it
and
his
sisters
even
thought
that
there
might
be
a
question
of
an
order
for
him
that
distinction
so
coveted
in
norway
if
they
made
love
sufficiently
to
the
president
carl
professed
to
be
quite
superior
to
a
mere
external
decoration
of
the
kind
though
longing
for
it
in
his
heart
and
marie
forstberg
whom
he
had
not
taken
into
his
confidence
in
the
matter
was
highly
indignant
with
his
sisters
for
supposing
that
it
should
depend
upon
the
president
and
not
upon
carl
own
merit
whether
he
received
it
or
not
mina
however
had
declared
with
a
great
air
of
knowledge
of
the
world
that
people
could
trust
to
merit
alone
and
that
besides
and
here
she
had
laid
her
hand
flatteringly
on
her
friend
shoulder
they
were
not
all
so
strict
and
as
marie
forstberg
and
so
she
paid
her
court
to
the
president
accordingly
in
the
evening
when
the
gentlemen
were
sitting
together
out
in
the
wood
and
elizabeth
came
out
to
them
with
a
fresh
supply
of
hot
water
for
their
toddy
the
said
president
thought
proper
to
make
a
joke
that
brought
the
colour
to
her
cheeks
she
made
no
reply
but
the
trembled
in
her
hands
as
she
put
it
down
and
as
she
did
so
she
gave
the
speaker
such
a
look
that
for
a
moment
he
felt
cowed
beck
he
broke
out
did
you
see
the
look
she
gave
me
she
is
a
proud
girl
said
carl
who
was
highly
incensed
but
who
had
his
reasons
for
restraining
himself
before
his
superior
a
proud
girl
indeed
returned
the
other
in
a
tone
which
implied
very
clearly
that
in
his
opinion
impudent
hussy
would
have
been
the
more
correct
description
a
girl
i
mean
said
carl
evasively
by
way
of
correction
and
laughed
constrainedly
elizabeth
had
heard
what
he
said
she
was
hurt
and
for
the
first
time
instituted
a
comparison
between
him
and
salvé
if
salvé
had
been
in
his
place
he
would
not
have
got
out
of
it
in
that
way
later
on
in
the
evening
carl
met
her
alone
as
she
was
putting
things
to
rights
out
on
the
steps
after
the
departed
guests
and
he
said
i
hope
you
did
mind
what
that
blustering
old
brute
said
elizabeth
he
is
a
very
good
fellow
really
and
does
mean
anything
by
his
nonsense
elizabeth
was
silent
and
tried
to
avoid
answering
by
going
in
with
what
she
had
in
her
hands
come
i
wo
stand
your
being
offended
elizabeth
he
broke
out
suddenly
firing
up
in
a
moment
and
trying
to
catch
her
by
the
arm
that
hand
you
work
with
is
dearer
to
me
than
the
hands
of
all
the
fine
ladies
put
together
herr
beck
she
exclaimed
wildly
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
i
leave
this
house
this
very
night
if
you
say
a
word
more
she
disappeared
into
the
hall
but
he
followed
her
elizabeth
he
whispered
i
mean
it
in
earnest
she
tore
herself
hastily
from
him
and
went
into
the
kitchen
where
his
sisters
were
talking
together
over
the
fire
carl
went
out
for
a
solitary
walk
over
the
island
in
the
glorious
starlight
night
and
did
come
in
till
past
midnight
he
had
not
meant
what
he
said
quite
so
decidedly
in
earnest
but
now
after
seeing
her
standing
before
him
so
wondrously
beautiful
with
tears
in
her
eyes
now
he
meant
it
in
real
earnest
he
was
prepared
to
engage
himself
if
necessary
in
spite
of
every
consideration
the
next
morning
he
left
in
his
boat
for
arendal
having
whispered
to
her
however
in
passing
before
he
left
i
mean
it
in
earnest
the
repetition
of
these
words
threw
elizabeth
into
dire
perplexity
she
had
lain
and
thought
over
them
the
night
before
and
had
thrust
them
from
her
with
indignation
for
they
could
mean
nothing
else
than
that
he
had
brought
himself
to
dare
to
tell
her
that
he
had
conceived
a
passion
for
her
and
she
had
quite
determined
to
execute
her
threat
and
leave
the
house
but
now
repeated
in
this
tone
did
he
really
mean
to
ask
for
her
hand
and
heart
to
ask
her
to
be
his
an
officer
wife
there
lay
before
her
fancy
a
glittering
expanse
of
earlier
dreams
that
almost
made
her
giddy
and
the
whole
week
she
was
absent
and
pale
thinking
anxiously
of
sunday
when
he
was
to
return
what
would
he
say
then
and
what
should
she
answer
he
did
come
however
his
duties
having
required
him
to
make
another
journey
that
he
had
not
reckoned
upon
on
the
other
hand
marie
forstberg
did
appear
and
felt
at
once
that
some
change
or
other
must
have
come
over
elizabeth
as
she
pointedly
declined
all
assistance
from
her
and
in
the
look
which
marie
forstberg
intercepted
by
chance
there
was
something
even
hard
and
unfriendly
she
laid
her
hand
once
gently
upon
elizabeth
shoulder
but
it
produced
apparently
absolutely
no
impression
she
might
as
well
have
caressed
a
piece
of
wood
and
when
she
returned
to
the
again
she
could
help
asking
what
has
happened
to
elizabeth
but
the
others
had
not
observed
anything
unusual
carl
beck
contrary
to
his
custom
came
not
on
the
following
saturday
but
before
it
in
the
middle
of
the
week
and
he
strode
with
hasty
steps
through
the
rooms
when
he
did
see
elizabeth
he
found
her
at
last
she
was
standing
gazing
out
of
the
window
on
the
landing
out
of
which
all
that
was
to
be
seen
was
the
wooded
slope
of
the
hill
and
the
sky
above
it
she
heard
his
step
she
knew
that
he
was
coming
and
felt
a
sudden
indefinable
sense
of
apprehension
a
sort
of
panic
almost
as
if
she
could
have
jumped
out
of
the
window
what
should
she
answer
when
he
came
and
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
asked
in
a
low
voice
elizabeth
will
you
be
mine
she
felt
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
on
the
point
of
fainting
she
hardly
knew
what
she
did
but
pushed
him
involuntarily
away
from
her
he
seized
her
hand
afresh
and
asked
elizabeth
will
you
be
my
wife
she
was
very
pale
as
she
answered
yes
but
when
he
wanted
again
to
take
her
by
the
waist
she
sprang
suddenly
back
and
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
of
terror
elizabeth
he
said
tenderly
and
tried
again
to
approach
her
what
is
the
matter
with
you
if
you
only
knew
how
i
have
longed
for
this
moment
not
now
no
more
now
she
pleaded
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
another
time
but
you
say
elizabeth
that
you
are
my
but
he
felt
that
she
wanted
him
to
go
now
after
he
had
gone
she
sat
there
on
a
box
for
a
long
time
in
silence
gazing
straight
before
her
so
it
had
actually
come
to
pass
her
heart
beat
so
that
she
could
hear
it
herself
and
she
seemed
to
feel
a
dull
pain
there
her
face
little
by
little
acquired
a
fixed
cold
expression
she
was
thinking
that
he
was
then
telling
his
stepmother
of
their
engagement
and
fortifying
himself
for
her
reception
of
the
announcement
she
expected
to
be
called
down
but
no
summons
came
and
at
last
she
decided
to
go
without
being
called
in
the
they
were
all
quietly
intent
upon
their
several
occupations
carl
was
pretending
to
read
a
book
but
he
threw
her
a
stolen
tenderly
anxious
look
over
the
top
of
it
when
she
entered
supper
was
brought
in
and
everything
went
on
as
quietly
as
usual
even
to
his
customary
banter
to
elizabeth
it
seemed
as
if
there
was
a
mist
over
them
all
and
when
mina
once
asked
if
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
her
she
could
only
answer
mechanically
the
question
was
repeated
later
on
and
received
the
same
answer
she
brought
the
supper
things
in
and
took
them
out
as
usual
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
not
feel
the
floor
under
her
feet
or
what
she
carried
in
her
hand
the
evening
passed
and
they
went
to
bed
without
anything
happening
but
in
the
partial
darkness
of
the
he
seized
her
hand
passionately
and
said
my
elizabeth
elizabeth
she
was
not
in
a
condition
to
return
the
pressure
of
his
hand
and
when
he
approached
his
lips
to
her
forehead
she
hastily
drew
herself
away
i
came
out
here
alone
to
tell
you
this
dear
dearest
elizabeth
he
whispered
with
passion
trembling
in
his
voice
and
making
an
effort
to
draw
her
to
him
i
must
be
on
land
again
must
i
go
without
one
sign
that
you
care
for
me
she
bent
her
forehead
slowly
towards
him
and
he
kissed
it
and
she
then
immediately
left
him
my
beloved
one
he
whispered
after
her
elizabeth
lay
for
a
long
while
awake
she
would
have
given
anything
to
have
been
able
to
cry
but
the
tears
would
not
come
and
she
felt
as
if
she
was
freezing
internally
when
at
last
she
did
fall
asleep
it
was
not
of
him
she
dreamt
but
of
salvé
the
whole
time
of
salvé
she
saw
him
gazing
at
her
with
that
earnest
face
it
was
so
heavy
with
grief
and
she
stood
like
a
criminal
before
him
he
said
something
that
she
could
not
hear
but
she
understood
that
he
condemned
her
and
that
he
had
thrown
the
dress
overboard
she
rose
early
and
tried
to
occupy
her
thoughts
with
other
dreams
with
her
future
as
an
officer
lady
but
it
was
as
if
all
that
had
before
seemed
to
be
pure
gold
was
now
changed
to
brass
she
felt
unhappy
and
restless
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
could
make
up
her
mind
to
go
into
the
carl
beck
did
not
leave
that
morning
he
had
perceived
that
there
was
something
on
elizabeth
mind
during
the
forenoon
when
his
sisters
were
out
and
his
stepmother
was
occupied
he
found
an
opportunity
to
speak
with
her
alone
she
was
in
a
fever
always
waiting
for
him
to
have
spoken
to
madam
beck
elizabeth
he
said
gently
smoothing
her
hair
for
she
looked
dispirited
and
stood
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
i
leave
without
having
spoken
to
you
again
she
still
kept
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
but
did
withdraw
herself
from
his
hand
do
you
really
care
for
me
will
you
be
my
wife
she
was
silent
at
last
she
said
a
shade
paler
and
as
if
with
an
effort
yes
herr
beck
say
to
me
say
carl
he
pleaded
with
much
feeling
and
look
at
me
she
looked
at
him
but
not
as
he
had
expected
it
was
with
a
fixed
cold
look
she
said
yes
if
we
are
engaged
are
we
not
then
when
is
your
stepmother
to
know
it
she
asked
rather
dragging
the
words
out
one
after
the
other
dear
elizabeth
these
people
at
home
here
must
notice
nothing
for
for
three
months
when
i
shall
be
but
he
caught
an
expression
now
in
her
face
and
something
in
the
abrupt
way
in
which
she
drew
her
hand
from
him
that
made
him
keep
back
what
he
had
originally
intended
to
say
and
he
corrected
it
hastily
next
week
then
i
write
from
arendal
and
tell
my
father
and
then
let
my
stepmother
know
what
i
have
written
are
you
offended
elizabeth
dear
elizabeth
or
shall
i
do
it
at
once
he
broke
out
resolutely
and
seized
her
hand
again
no
no
not
now
next
week
let
it
not
be
till
next
week
she
cried
in
sudden
apprehension
returning
the
pressure
of
his
hand
at
the
same
time
almost
entreatingly
it
was
the
first
he
had
had
from
her
and
then
you
are
mine
elizabeth
yes
then
she
tried
to
avoid
meeting
his
eye
farewell
then
elizabeth
but
i
shall
come
back
on
saturday
i
live
for
longer
without
seeing
you
farewell
she
said
in
a
rather
toneless
voice
he
sprang
down
to
the
boat
that
lay
waiting
for
him
below
but
she
did
look
after
him
and
went
in
with
bowed
head
the
opposite
way
small
things
often
weigh
heavily
in
the
world
of
impressions
elizabeth
had
been
overpowered
by
what
seemed
to
her
the
magnanimity
of
his
nature
when
he
had
declared
that
he
would
elevate
her
into
the
position
of
his
wife
she
felt
that
it
was
her
worth
in
his
eyes
which
had
outweighed
all
other
considerations
that
he
should
shrink
from
the
inevitable
conflict
with
his
family
she
had
on
the
other
hand
never
for
a
moment
imagined
she
had
no
doubt
felt
herself
that
it
would
be
painful
but
had
stationed
herself
for
the
occasion
behind
his
masculine
shield
when
he
now
so
unexpectedly
began
to
press
for
time
at
first
even
proposing
to
be
away
himself
when
the
matter
came
on
in
his
home
a
feeling
took
possession
of
her
which
in
her
inward
dread
she
instinctively
clutched
at
as
a
drowning
wretch
at
a
straw
as
it
seemed
to
suggest
a
possibility
even
now
of
reconsidering
her
promise
she
had
a
hard
and
heavy
time
of
it
during
the
two
days
until
carl
returned
and
the
nights
were
passed
in
fever
on
saturday
evening
he
came
and
the
first
he
greeted
was
herself
he
seemed
almost
as
she
passed
in
and
out
of
the
room
quiet
and
pale
as
if
he
did
wish
any
longer
to
conceal
the
relations
now
existing
between
them
he
had
with
him
a
letter
from
his
father
which
was
read
aloud
when
the
meal
was
over
it
was
dated
from
a
south
american
port
and
mention
was
made
in
it
of
salvé
among
others
off
cape
hatteras
they
had
had
stormy
weather
and
had
their
topmast
carried
away
it
remained
attached
by
a
couple
of
ropes
and
with
the
heavy
sea
that
was
running
was
swinging
backwards
and
forwards
as
it
hung
against
the
lower
rigging
threatening
to
destroy
it
salvé
kristiansen
had
come
forward
in
the
emergency
and
ventured
aloft
to
cut
it
adrift
and
as
he
sat
there
the
whole
had
gone
over
the
side
he
fell
with
it
but
had
the
luck
to
be
caught
in
a
as
he
fell
and
so
saved
his
life
it
was
pluckily
done
ended
the
account
but
nevertheless
all
is
not
exactly
right
about
him
and
he
is
not
turning
out
as
well
as
he
promised
i
never
expected
very
much
from
him
remarked
carl
with
a
contemptuous
shrug
of
his
shoulders
he
a
bad
lot
he
did
see
the
resentful
eyes
which
elizabeth
fixed
upon
him
for
these
words
and
she
sat
for
a
long
while
afterwards
out
in
the
kitchen
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
silent
and
angry
thinking
over
them
a
resolution
was
forming
in
her
mind
before
they
retired
to
rest
carl
whispered
to
her
i
have
written
to
my
father
and
elizabeth
is
our
elizabeth
was
the
last
in
the
room
putting
it
to
rights
and
when
she
left
she
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
writing
materials
with
her
she
lay
down
on
her
bed
but
about
midnight
she
was
sitting
up
by
a
light
and
disfiguring
a
sheet
of
paper
with
writing
it
was
to
this
effect
forgive
me
that
i
can
not
be
your
wife
for
my
heart
is
given
to
elizabeth
raklev
she
folded
the
paper
and
fastened
it
with
a
pin
for
want
of
a
wafer
and
then
quietly
opening
the
door
of
the
room
where
madam
beck
was
sleeping
placed
her
lips
close
to
her
ear
and
whispered
her
name
madam
beck
woke
up
in
some
alarm
when
she
saw
elizabeth
standing
before
her
fully
dressed
and
apparently
prepared
for
a
journey
madam
beck
elizabeth
said
quietly
i
am
going
to
confide
something
to
you
and
ask
for
your
advice
and
assistance
your
has
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
it
was
last
sunday
and
i
said
yes
but
now
i
have
changed
my
mind
and
am
going
back
to
my
aunt
or
farther
away
still
if
you
can
tell
me
how
for
i
am
afraid
he
will
follow
me
madam
beck
stared
at
her
in
mute
amazement
and
at
first
put
on
an
incredulous
and
rather
scornful
expression
but
as
she
came
to
feel
that
it
might
all
be
true
she
raised
herself
involuntarily
higher
up
in
the
bed
but
why
do
you
come
with
this
now
particularly
in
the
middle
of
the
night
she
said
with
a
suspicious
and
searching
look
because
he
has
written
to
his
father
about
it
and
means
to
tell
you
and
the
rest
so
he
has
already
written
that
was
his
object
then
in
bringing
you
into
the
house
here
madam
beck
added
after
a
pause
with
some
bitterness
it
seemed
to
strike
her
then
that
there
was
something
noble
in
elizabeth
conduct
and
looking
at
her
more
kindly
she
said
yes
you
are
right
it
is
best
for
you
to
go
away
to
some
place
where
he
will
not
find
it
so
easy
to
reach
you
she
lapsed
into
thought
again
then
a
brilliant
idea
occurred
to
her
and
she
got
up
and
put
on
her
clothes
she
had
a
man
clearheadedness
and
her
habits
of
management
stood
her
in
good
stead
on
the
present
occasion
the
dutch
skipper
garvloit
who
had
married
her
happened
just
a
day
or
two
before
to
have
been
inquiring
for
a
norwegian
girl
who
would
be
able
to
help
in
the
house
and
here
was
just
the
place
for
elizabeth
she
had
only
to
go
on
board
his
vessel
that
lay
over
at
arendal
ready
to
sail
madam
beck
went
into
the
at
once
and
wrote
a
letter
to
garvloit
which
she
gave
to
elizabeth
together
with
a
good
round
sum
of
money
wages
due
she
said
and
afterwards
elizabeth
was
rowing
over
alone
in
the
quiet
moonlight
night
to
arendal
the
smooth
sound
lay
full
of
shining
stars
between
the
deep
shadows
of
the
ridges
on
either
side
with
a
light
from
a
mast
here
and
there
denoting
the
presence
of
vessels
under
the
land
a
falling
star
would
now
and
then
leave
a
stream
of
light
behind
it
and
she
felt
a
sense
of
joyous
exultation
that
she
could
only
subdue
by
rowing
hard
for
long
spells
she
was
like
one
escaped
relieved
from
some
oppressive
burden
and
how
she
looked
forward
to
seeing
marie
forstberg
now
she
arrived
in
the
town
before
daybreak
and
went
straight
up
to
her
aunt
to
whom
she
announced
that
madam
beck
wished
her
to
take
a
place
in
holland
with
garvloit
who
was
on
the
point
of
sailing
she
showed
her
the
letter
there
was
no
time
to
lose
the
old
woman
listened
to
her
for
a
while
and
then
said
abruptly
there
has
been
some
difficulty
with
the
lieutenant
elizabeth
yes
aunt
there
has
she
replied
he
made
love
to
me
he
did
and
first
i
said
as
good
as
yes
but
i
do
mean
to
have
him
and
so
i
told
madam
beck
so
you
would
have
him
was
the
rejoinder
after
an
astonished
pause
and
the
reason
i
suppose
was
that
you
would
rather
have
salvé
yes
aunt
in
a
low
voice
and
why
in
the
world
did
you
take
him
then
the
tears
came
into
elizabeth
eyes
well
as
people
make
their
beds
so
they
must
lie
said
the
old
woman
severely
and
betook
herself
then
without
any
further
observation
to
the
preparation
of
the
morning
coffee
as
elizabeth
went
down
to
the
quay
to
get
a
boat
to
take
her
out
to
the
merchantman
she
looked
in
at
the
where
she
found
marie
forstberg
already
up
and
busy
in
the
in
her
morning
dress
she
was
greatly
astonished
when
elizabeth
told
her
of
her
new
destination
it
was
such
an
advantageous
offer
elizabeth
explained
an
almost
independent
place
in
the
house
and
madam
beck
had
herself
advised
her
to
take
it
but
though
she
used
all
her
wit
to
keep
the
other
off
the
scent
marie
forstberg
found
a
want
of
connection
somewhere
and
elizabeth
could
see
it
in
her
eyes
she
asked
no
further
questions
however
and
when
they
took
leave
of
each
other
they
embraced
in
tears
out
at
tromö
the
surprise
was
great
when
it
was
found
that
elizabeth
had
gone
carl
beck
had
found
her
letter
under
the
door
but
had
never
imagined
that
she
had
left
and
had
gone
out
with
it
in
violent
agitation
of
mind
and
did
not
come
home
again
till
late
in
the
afternoon
madam
beck
had
in
the
meantime
confided
the
matter
to
her
daughters
and
they
would
understand
she
said
that
not
a
word
of
it
must
be
mentioned
outside
the
house
although
his
eyes
sought
for
her
unceasingly
carl
made
no
express
inquiry
after
her
till
the
evening
and
when
he
heard
that
she
was
gone
and
was
perhaps
by
that
time
already
under
sail
for
holland
he
sat
for
awhile
as
if
petrified
looking
scornfully
at
them
then
one
after
another
he
said
if
i
thought
that
i
had
any
of
you
to
thank
for
this
i
here
he
seized
the
chair
he
had
been
sitting
on
dashed
it
down
upon
the
floor
so
that
it
broke
and
sprang
but
her
letter
was
unfortunately
clear
enough
she
loved
another
and
he
knew
too
who
it
was
chapter
xii
it
was
some
months
after
the
juno
lay
ready
to
sail
in
the
roads
of
monte
video
where
she
had
taken
in
hides
as
part
of
her
home
cargo
the
remainder
of
coffee
she
was
to
load
at
rio
and
in
the
meantime
she
had
filled
up
with
coals
for
that
port
she
was
lying
in
tropical
costume
with
awnings
over
the
fore
and
after
deck
as
a
protection
against
the
fierce
rays
of
the
sun
and
the
crew
were
going
about
in
correspondingly
airy
clothing
with
open
shirts
and
canvas
trousers
brown
and
shiny
with
perspiration
and
gasping
after
every
breath
it
was
the
hottest
season
of
the
year
the
pitch
was
melting
in
the
chinks
between
the
planking
of
the
decks
and
the
tar
running
down
her
sides
they
had
lain
thus
for
a
couple
of
days
hoping
to
receive
before
starting
the
post
which
they
had
been
disappointed
in
not
finding
on
their
arrival
and
what
a
disappointment
this
can
be
only
those
who
have
been
in
one
of
these
ships
that
go
on
long
voyages
can
understand
in
foreign
ports
there
may
be
many
a
wild
pleasure
to
be
enjoyed
but
the
longing
to
hear
from
home
is
the
strongest
feeling
among
sailors
after
all
the
mate
had
gone
ashore
to
make
one
last
inquiry
before
they
sailed
and
as
the
came
alongside
again
it
was
seen
that
he
had
the
precious
packet
in
his
hand
he
sprang
up
the
and
disappeared
aft
without
a
word
to
where
the
captain
was
sitting
by
a
small
table
with
a
carafe
and
glass
before
him
mopping
his
bald
head
in
the
heat
you
got
them
at
last
then
he
said
as
the
mate
laid
the
packet
on
the
table
before
him
and
retired
a
few
paces
while
he
opened
it
almost
the
first
letter
that
caught
his
eye
was
one
to
himself
from
his
son
and
his
face
brightened
he
ran
rapidly
over
the
others
making
a
comment
here
and
there
according
as
he
was
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
of
the
men
to
whom
they
were
addressed
and
gathering
them
up
in
a
bundle
handed
them
over
then
to
the
mate
with
a
cheery
here
you
are
johnson
letters
for
every
one
from
wives
and
sweethearts
and
i
do
know
whom
besides
the
news
that
the
post
had
come
had
spread
like
wildfire
over
the
ship
and
by
the
time
the
mate
began
to
call
out
the
addresses
by
the
main
hatch
the
whole
crew
were
assembled
with
the
exception
of
a
straggler
or
two
who
had
happened
to
be
aloft
and
who
were
now
to
be
seen
hurrying
down
the
ratlines
the
only
one
who
neither
expected
news
nor
cared
apparently
whether
he
received
a
letter
or
not
was
salvé
kristiansen
while
the
parcel
was
being
distributed
he
remained
standing
by
the
wheel
intent
apparently
upon
watching
the
movements
of
the
two
men
who
were
hoisting
up
and
making
fast
the
his
lips
were
compressed
and
when
he
gave
the
men
a
hand
now
and
then
it
was
not
a
very
willing
one
and
was
generally
accompanied
by
some
bitter
or
sarcastic
remark
his
nature
since
they
last
sailed
from
arendal
seemed
to
have
turned
to
gall
and
when
the
captain
had
casually
mentioned
in
his
letter
home
that
he
was
not
so
well
satisfied
with
him
he
had
had
good
reason
for
saying
so
there
had
been
all
sorts
of
unpleasantness
between
them
and
if
any
discontent
or
difference
between
himself
and
the
crew
prevailed
salvé
was
sure
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
he
had
found
a
rancid
set
up
on
four
legs
with
a
tail
as
he
was
walking
on
the
poop
one
evening
in
the
moonlight
and
as
complaints
had
been
recently
made
about
the
food
a
good
deal
of
which
had
become
worse
than
bad
from
the
effects
of
the
hot
climate
he
had
at
once
attributed
to
salvé
this
pointed
method
of
drawing
his
attention
to
the
subject
again
it
seemed
almost
as
if
he
had
some
cause
for
bitterness
against
himself
personally
and
as
he
had
always
treated
him
with
marked
favour
he
was
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
the
reason
for
it
with
the
exception
of
the
captain
who
had
retained
his
seat
at
the
of
the
poop
salvé
was
soon
the
only
human
being
to
be
seen
on
deck
the
whole
crew
had
disappeared
and
might
have
been
found
poring
over
their
letters
two
and
two
or
singly
in
the
most
places
from
the
main
and
fore
top
even
to
the
bowsprit
end
where
one
had
erected
a
pavilion
for
himself
out
of
a
fold
of
the
jib
captain
beck
letter
to
judge
from
his
gestures
and
exclamations
was
not
giving
him
the
pleasure
which
he
had
anticipated
his
whole
face
up
to
the
top
of
his
head
had
become
red
as
a
lobster
and
he
sat
now
drumming
with
one
hand
on
his
knee
and
casting
an
occasional
fierce
look
over
at
salvé
in
the
attitude
of
a
man
beside
himself
with
anger
at
last
he
brought
the
hand
in
which
he
held
the
letter
down
upon
the
table
with
a
force
that
sent
the
decanter
and
glass
flying
and
thrusting
the
fragments
aside
with
his
foot
he
strode
up
and
down
the
deck
for
a
couple
of
minutes
and
then
came
towards
salvé
as
if
he
meant
to
say
something
and
as
the
latter
could
very
well
perceive
that
it
was
not
going
to
be
anything
pleasant
his
countenance
assumed
an
expression
of
defiance
accordingly
he
changed
his
mind
though
before
he
reached
him
and
turning
short
round
shouted
instead
where
is
the
second
mate
where
is
the
whole
watch
and
he
looked
furiously
about
him
as
if
surprised
although
he
knew
very
well
how
they
were
occupied
and
that
it
had
been
decided
not
to
weigh
anchor
until
later
in
the
day
when
they
would
have
the
evening
breeze
ay
ay
sir
was
heard
from
the
mate
in
the
and
he
raised
himself
and
came
forward
with
the
letter
he
had
been
reading
in
his
hand
stand
by
to
man
the
windlass
pipe
all
hands
ordered
the
captain
and
roared
the
command
again
gratuitously
through
the
trumpet
the
crew
turned
out
from
their
several
retreats
with
sour
looks
they
had
expected
to
be
left
alone
until
after
when
there
would
have
been
a
general
interchange
of
news
on
the
forecastle
and
now
there
came
instead
a
hail
of
orders
from
the
as
if
the
captain
had
all
of
a
sudden
become
possessed
there
was
already
a
good
deal
of
discontent
prevailing
among
the
crew
both
on
account
of
the
bad
food
which
they
had
to
put
up
with
and
on
account
of
their
leave
ashore
at
monte
video
having
been
as
they
thought
capriciously
refused
and
it
was
therefore
something
more
nearly
approaching
to
a
howl
than
a
song
that
was
now
heard
from
the
capstan
and
from
the
party
who
were
hoisting
the
heavy
mainsail
the
customary
english
chorus
haul
the
bowline
the
captain
he
is
growling
haul
the
bowline
the
bowline
haul
was
sung
with
offensive
significance
and
though
at
the
last
heavy
heave
with
which
the
enormous
anchor
was
catted
up
to
the
bows
the
mate
tried
to
create
a
diversion
in
the
feeling
by
a
cheery
saat
hal
paa
the
concluding
words
of
the
song
aa
hal
i
aa
iaa
cheerily
men
were
delivered
in
a
scornful
shout
you
have
a
chance
of
cooling
yourselves
presently
my
lads
said
salvé
coming
up
at
the
moment
from
his
own
heavy
work
with
the
when
we
weather
the
point
all
the
have
to
be
set
and
the
remark
had
the
effect
which
he
desired
of
intensifying
the
prevailing
irritation
in
spite
of
the
vertical
heat
the
hail
of
orders
from
the
trumpet
continued
accompanied
by
reprimands
and
all
round
until
the
crew
were
nearly
in
a
state
of
mutiny
and
it
was
not
until
late
in
the
evening
that
he
showed
any
signs
of
exhaustion
his
temper
had
not
improved
next
day
he
looked
as
if
he
had
a
determination
of
blood
to
the
head
and
every
time
he
came
near
salvé
he
glared
at
him
as
if
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
control
himself
from
an
outburst
of
some
kind
or
another
he
knew
that
salvé
had
made
love
to
elizabeth
and
had
wished
to
make
her
presents
since
she
had
come
into
his
house
and
that
the
same
girl
was
now
to
be
his
son
wife
the
idea
was
absolutely
intolerable
at
last
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
salvé
had
just
deposited
a
coil
of
rope
aft
and
the
captain
after
watching
his
movements
with
evidently
suppressed
irritation
broke
out
suddenly
without
preface
of
any
kind
you
i
believe
had
some
acquaintance
with
that
that
elizabeth
raklev
i
took
into
my
house
salvé
felt
the
blood
rush
to
his
heart
he
seemed
to
know
what
was
coming
the
post
the
captain
continued
in
a
bitterly
contemptuous
tone
has
brought
me
the
delightful
intelligence
that
my
son
has
engaged
himself
to
her
congratulate
you
captain
said
salvé
his
voice
almost
failed
him
and
he
was
deadly
pale
but
his
eyes
flashed
with
a
wild
defiance
he
went
forward
and
the
captain
growled
after
him
to
himself
he
can
have
that
to
fret
over
now
instead
of
the
food
and
as
the
mate
was
coming
up
the
cabin
stairs
at
the
moment
polishing
the
sextant
he
turned
away
with
a
look
of
grim
satisfaction
to
take
the
altitude
when
the
juno
last
sailed
from
arendal
she
had
changed
two
of
her
crew
one
of
the
new
hands
was
a
creature
from
the
fjord
region
north
of
stavanger
who
called
himself
nils
buvaagen
but
whose
name
had
been
changed
by
the
others
to
uvaagen
on
account
of
his
evident
predisposition
to
sleep
he
was
incredibly
and
communicative
especially
on
the
subject
of
his
wife
and
children
of
which
latter
he
apparently
had
his
nest
full
and
had
soon
become
the
butt
of
the
ship
salvé
was
the
only
one
who
ever
took
his
part
and
that
only
because
he
saw
all
the
others
against
him
and
having
also
been
the
means
of
saving
his
life
when
he
had
been
washed
overboard
one
dark
night
in
the
english
channel
he
had
inspired
the
simple
fellow
with
a
perfectly
devoted
attachment
to
him
they
were
up
on
the
mainyard
together
that
evening
where
they
had
been
helping
to
carry
out
an
order
with
the
mainsail
the
rest
had
gone
down
again
but
salvé
who
felt
a
longing
to
be
alone
had
remained
aloft
and
was
standing
on
the
with
his
elbows
resting
on
the
yard
nils
sympathetic
eyes
had
perceived
from
his
behaviour
and
whole
appearance
that
day
that
there
was
something
unusual
the
matter
with
him
and
when
he
saw
that
salvé
remained
behind
he
remained
too
observing
that
it
would
be
pleasant
to
cool
for
a
while
before
going
to
their
hammocks
in
the
close
air
between
decks
the
sky
above
them
blazed
like
a
cupola
inlaid
with
patines
of
bright
gold
obliquely
from
the
horizon
the
southern
cross
was
rising
and
the
evening
star
shone
in
the
warm
night
before
the
moon
had
yet
risen
with
a
silver
gleam
that
threw
clear
light
and
shadow
upon
the
deck
below
while
the
vessel
seemed
to
plough
through
a
sea
of
phosphorescence
leaving
in
her
wake
a
long
trail
of
bluish
glittering
light
from
the
forecastle
below
came
wafted
up
a
sentimental
sailor
song
the
burden
of
which
was
pretty
well
summed
up
in
the
two
concluding
lines
but
never
more
her
name
i
utter
till
i
die
for
rosy
though
her
lips
were
her
heart
it
was
a
lie
it
sounded
melancholy
at
that
hour
and
nils
to
judge
from
the
occasional
sighs
with
which
he
had
accompanied
it
was
moved
when
it
came
to
an
end
salvé
turned
suddenly
to
him
you
are
distressing
yourself
for
another
sweetheart
now
nils
what
would
you
have
done
if
it
had
been
your
own
my
wife
he
had
evidently
not
for
the
moment
taken
in
the
idea
and
looked
with
all
his
heavy
countenance
at
salvé
yes
would
you
have
liked
to
see
her
sunk
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
my
karen
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
i
go
there
myself
first
yes
but
if
she
had
been
unfaithful
to
you
persisted
salvé
seeming
to
take
a
fiendish
delight
in
bringing
home
the
idea
to
the
poor
fellow
but
she
is
not
was
the
rejoinder
nils
had
no
genius
for
the
abstract
and
no
more
satisfaction
was
to
be
got
out
of
him
but
at
the
same
time
he
had
been
shocked
and
went
down
shortly
after
without
saying
a
word
salvé
still
remained
aloft
the
dull
consciousness
of
engagement
with
the
captain
son
alternating
with
a
more
active
desire
for
revenge
upon
the
captain
himself
for
the
manner
in
which
he
had
conveyed
the
information
and
the
result
of
his
brooding
up
there
upon
the
yard
was
a
determination
to
desert
as
soon
as
the
juno
arrived
at
rio
he
would
never
go
back
to
arendal
and
he
would
no
longer
tread
the
same
deck
with
the
father
of
carl
beck
later
on
in
the
night
when
the
moon
had
risen
nils
who
had
not
been
able
to
sleep
in
his
hammock
came
up
to
salvé
again
and
drew
him
aside
behind
the
as
if
for
a
private
conversation
what
would
i
have
done
you
asked
i
tell
you
he
said
after
a
short
pause
and
his
honest
face
seemed
to
express
a
vivid
realisation
of
the
whole
misery
of
the
situation
i
would
have
died
upon
the
doorstep
salvé
stood
and
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
there
came
a
strange
pallor
over
his
face
in
the
moonlight
look
you
he
said
ironically
laying
his
hand
upon
the
shoulder
i
have
never
a
wife
but
all
the
same
i
am
dead
upon
the
doorstep
then
in
the
next
breath
and
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
he
said
of
course
i
am
only
joking
you
know
and
left
him
with
a
hard
forced
laugh
nils
remained
where
he
was
and
pondered
not
knowing
exactly
how
to
take
it
it
was
possible
salvé
had
only
been
making
fun
of
him
but
another
feeling
eventually
predominated
it
told
him
that
he
had
had
a
glimpse
into
a
despairing
soul
and
he
was
profoundly
moved
chapter

they
stood
slowly
away
to
the
along
the
coast
of
brazil
every
morning
towards
the
end
of
the
when
the
sun
rose
in
its
gorgeous
majesty
from
the
sea
there
came
a
refreshing
breeze
off
the
land
bringing
with
it
the
perfume
of
a
thousand
aromatic
herbs
albatrosses
and
circled
round
the
ship
were
to
be
seen
in
shoals
and
all
nature
animate
and
inanimate
seemed
to
be
freshened
for
the
time
into
activity
and
life
but
gradually
the
breeze
would
become
warmer
and
lighter
and
then
die
away
altogether
so
that
before
noon
the
sails
would
hang
flapping
against
the
mast
they
scarcely
made
five
knots
in
the
watch
and
the
heat
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
was
unbearable
as
unbearable
almost
as
the
temper
which
showed
no
signs
of
improvement
and
which
vented
itself
in
a
systematic
grinding
of
the
crew
who
captain
beck
declared
were
getting
into
intolerable
habits
of
idleness
strange
things
occurred
on
board
just
at
this
time
which
taken
in
connection
with
the
captain
mood
produced
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
there
was
some
evil
influence
at
work
by
which
both
the
ship
and
the
captain
were
possessed
groans
had
been
distinctly
heard
down
in
the
hold
among
the
coals
and
the
sailmaker
affirmed
that
on
several
nights
in
succession
he
had
seen
a
man
go
from
amidships
aft
along
the
bulwark
railings
stand
still
and
point
with
his
hand
to
the
compass
and
then
disappear
in
the
wake
of
the
ship
another
declared
that
he
had
seen
the
ship
genius
proceed
in
the
same
direction
and
jump
overboard
cap
and
all
he
was
no
higher
than
a
half
and
when
the
genius
deserts
a
ship
it
betokens
in
the
sailors
superstitious
creed
that
she
is
about
to
founder
the
unaccountable
sounds
in
the
hold
continued
and
changed
one
day
when
the
hatch
was
battened
down
to
a
kind
of
wail
which
ceased
however
when
for
fear
of
an
explosion
of
it
was
taken
off
again
on
the
following
day
the
cook
who
had
gone
down
for
water
came
hurrying
back
with
a
scared
face
and
declared
that
he
had
seen
a
man
sitting
there
in
a
red
jacket
it
is
the
ship
genius
lamenting
the
ship
was
hesitatingly
suggested
by
some
but
when
the
cook
objected
that
the
creature
was
at
least
as
large
as
big
anders
the
boatswain
and
proceeded
besides
to
endow
him
with
sable
colouring
and
claws
the
terror
reached
its
height
the
captain
had
hitherto
replied
to
these
as
he
conceived
them
fresh
attempts
to
provoke
him
by
still
further
grinding
but
when
this
last
observation
of
the
cook
was
communicated
to
him
he
broke
out
scornfully
pointing
at
the
same
time
with
the
bitten
mouthpiece
of
his
old
meerschaum
pipe
at
the
speaker
i
think
there
is
a
sufficiently
stupid
devil
in
the
hold
sticking
in
every
one
of
you
rascals
is
there
one
of
you
with
courage
enough
to
go
down
into
the
or
must
i
go
myself
the
first
mate
proposed
to
accompany
him
but
salvé
now
came
forward
and
declared
that
he
for
his
part
would
as
soon
go
down
into
the
hold
as
up
aloft
a
man
wo
sweat
half
as
much
at
that
work
he
added
with
sarcastic
significance
he
went
down
accordingly
with
a
light
and
after
a
few
moments
search
came
upon
a
miserable
wretch
who
had
squeezed
himself
in
behind
the
he
was
as
black
as
a
negro
from
the
and
declared
tremblingly
when
he
came
up
on
deck
that
he
had
deserted
from
his
regiment
in
monte
video
which
was
an
offence
punishable
by
death
and
that
he
had
thought
he
might
remain
concealed
until
the
vessel
arrived
at
rio
that
he
had
come
on
board
in
the
dark
on
the
last
evening
they
lay
in
the
harbour
and
had
hidden
himself
under
the
coals
and
that
when
they
had
battened
down
the
hatch
he
had
been
nearly
suffocated
with
and
had
lain
and
groaned
occasionally
he
had
found
an
opportunity
at
night
in
the
dark
to
climb
up
into
the
astern
and
had
lain
there
and
breathed
fresh
air
until
nearly
sunrise
once
or
twice
he
had
been
into
the
caboose
and
got
something
to
eat
and
sometimes
he
had
stopped
by
the
compass
as
it
seemed
to
him
their
journey
was
never
coming
to
an
end
and
he
wanted
to
assure
himself
that
the
vessel
was
really
steering
a
northerly
course
to
rio
as
he
had
heard
from
some
one
in
the
harbour
she
intended
to
do
he
was
a
young
man
with
small
quick
eyes
about
height
and
apparently
a
spaniard
or
portuguese
but
could
make
himself
understood
in
english
the
captain
had
some
doubts
as
to
the
truth
of
his
story
as
his
rank
appeared
to
be
superior
to
that
of
a
common
soldier
and
from
his
anxiety
not
to
betray
his
presence
in
the
ship
even
after
they
had
got
out
into
the
open
sea
he
concluded
that
he
was
a
political
refugee
who
at
that
time
would
not
be
very
safe
even
at
rio
he
ordered
food
to
be
given
him
and
promised
that
he
should
make
his
way
ashore
as
best
he
could
but
that
he
was
not
to
expect
help
from
him
as
the
captain
had
no
intention
of
involving
himself
with
the
authorities
on
his
account
salvé
who
like
the
generality
of
sailors
could
talk
a
good
deal
of
english
gradually
attached
himself
to
the
spaniard
and
found
him
an
entertaining
and
clever
fellow
before
a
light
afternoon
breeze
they
glided
at
last
from
the
sea
into
the
narrow
channel
that
runs
up
to
rio
de
janeiro
one
of
the
loveliest
in
the
world
with
majestic
granite
mountains
on
either
side
one
of
which
was
already
blazing
in
the
ruddy
light
of
the
evening
sun
while
the
other
in
shade
stood
out
a
deep
violet
against
the
clear
blue
of
the
sky
above
on
the
one
side
at
the
foot
of
the
sugarloaf
mountain
they
had
the
fortress
of
praja
on
the
other
the
castle
of
santa
cruz
and
facing
them
on
the
highest
point
in
the
harbour
the
slender
that
announces
every
ship
as
it
appears
at
the
entrance
of
the
channel
so
beautiful
was
the
scene
that
under
its
softening
influence
salvé
felt
almost
inclined
to
regret
his
determination
to
desert
the
feeling
however
lasted
no
longer
than
the
beauty
which
produced
it
the
soft
lights
died
away
upon
the
hills
and
with
them
the
softer
feelings
which
had
crept
in
upon
his
heart
night
settled
down
upon
the
outer
world
and
with
it
returned
the
gloomy
thoughts
that
now
for
many
days
had
made
his
mind
their
home
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
the
brazilian
would
have
it
in
his
power
to
assist
him
in
effecting
his
purpose
when
they
arrived
in
the
harbour
and
he
had
therefore
found
opportunities
of
rendering
him
indebted
to
him
for
many
small
services
he
lent
him
clothes
now
to
appear
among
the
other
sailors
when
they
were
mustered
before
the
authorities
who
came
on
board
immediately
after
the
ship
entered
the
harbour
and
it
thus
escaped
their
notice
that
there
was
one
over
the
number
returned
by
the
captain
as
his
crew
the
harbour
pilot
however
a
consequential
mulatto
in
a
panama
hat
and
red
feather
and
decorated
with
a
badge
and
staff
was
more
and
soon
perceived
from
the
irritable
tone
in
which
the
song
at
the
capstan
was
sung
again
as
they
warped
the
vessel
round
to
her
anchorage
in
the
ilha
das
cobras
basin
that
there
was
discontent
prevailing
on
board
and
it
was
no
doubt
owing
to
a
hint
from
him
that
already
the
same
evening
there
were
runners
waiting
about
near
them
on
the
quay
captain
beck
was
out
of
humour
both
with
himself
and
with
his
crew
down
in
a
warm
climate
he
was
always
irritable
and
now
that
he
believed
his
authority
weakened
he
had
become
a
perfect
tyrant
the
prospect
of
another
voyage
under
his
command
was
more
than
many
of
his
crew
could
face
and
preparations
were
made
by
many
of
them
to
leave
the
ship
as
soon
as
they
should
have
received
whatever
portion
of
pay
on
account
the
captain
proposed
as
is
customary
when
a
vessel
is
in
harbour
to
distribute
salvé
however
did
not
wait
for
this
and
already
the
second
night
he
and
the
brazilian
had
disappeared
there
was
a
sharp
search
instituted
with
the
assistance
of
the
harbour
police
especially
in
the
house
of
one
particular
runner
who
had
been
seen
talking
with
the
crew
but
he
gave
them
such
full
liberty
to
search
his
house
and
showed
such
a
clear
conscience
in
the
matter
that
the
police
had
to
admit
that
they
were
off
the
scent
this
time
the
captain
after
this
intrusted
the
nightwatches
only
to
those
among
the
crew
upon
whom
he
could
place
reliance
hauled
off
from
the
quay
every
evening
and
absolutely
refused
all
leave
on
shore
he
had
only
received
the
thanks
he
deserved
he
remarked
bitterly
for
having
helped
that
thief
who
by
way
of
return
had
taken
from
him
his
best
man
salvé
desertion
indeed
irritated
him
more
than
he
cared
to
admit
to
himself
he
had
according
to
promise
had
him
taught
navigation
by
the
first
mate
on
the
voyage
out
and
had
settled
in
his
own
mind
that
when
he
himself
retired
from
the
sea
salvé
should
command
the
juno
for
him
he
certainly
never
would
find
another
of
equal
capacity
and
at
the
same
time
so
thoroughly
to
be
depended
upon
and
now
all
his
comfortable
plans
were
upset
before
leaving
the
vessel
salvé
placed
his
silver
watch
on
which
he
had
scratched
with
the
point
of
his
knife
in
remembrance
of
salvé
kristiansen
in
the
waistcoat
pocket
of
nils
who
was
snoring
loud
and
long
in
his
hammock
alongside
and
then
unobserved
by
the
watch
on
deck
the
two
friends
clambered
over
to
the
quay
in
the
silent
night
by
means
of
the
shore
rope
and
disappeared
at
once
into
the
darkness
of
the
neighbouring
alleys
the
brazilian
appeared
to
be
well
acquainted
with
the
localities
and
anxious
at
the
same
time
for
he
avoided
the
lighted
streets
and
often
stopped
at
dark
corners
to
reconnoitre
and
see
that
the
way
was
clear
of
the
night
police
after
picking
their
way
for
an
hour
among
narrow
lanes
they
came
out
into
a
suburb
where
the
houses
began
to
alternate
with
garden
walls
over
which
hung
diffusing
their
heavy
perfume
through
the
quiet
night
they
had
to
cross
an
open
place
to
the
other
suburb
mata
poreas
and
upon
the
rising
ground
to
one
side
of
them
they
saw
a
building
that
looked
like
a
fortress
enclosed
by
a
stone
wall
which
caused
salvé
comrade
considerable
perturbation
it
was
the
house
of
correction
before
which
there
was
always
a
sentry
on
duty
they
passed
it
however
unchallenged
and
after
further
walking
the
brazilian
halted
at
last
before
a
garden
wall
in
which
there
was
a
small
wicket
gate
he
looked
cautiously
round
him
and
said
excitedly
we
must
climb
over
here
and
then
we
are
safe
he
climbed
up
on
salvé
back
and
so
on
to
the
top
of
the
wall
drew
salvé
up
beside
him
and
then
sprang
down
into
the
little
garden
and
began
to
roll
about
on
the
grass
as
if
he
had
taken
leave
of
his
senses
crying
salvado
salvado
he
rushed
up
then
to
the
little
villa
that
lay
half
overshadowed
by
trees
and
knocking
in
a
particular
manner
at
the
door
called
out
paolina
paolina
a
female
in
with
a
young
but
rather
deep
voice
opened
the
shutter
from
within
and
put
out
her
head
federigo
she
said
tremblingly
and
there
followed
then
a
rapid
interchange
of
questions
and
answers
in
spanish
which
salvé
did
not
understand
he
gathered
merely
that
she
was
surprised
to
see
a
stranger
with
him
and
that
he
calmed
her
apprehensions
with
the
word
amigo
followed
by
a
short
explanation
she
opened
the
door
and
fell
impulsively
on
federigo
neck
kissing
him
on
both
cheeks
and
sobbing
after
the
custom
of
the
place
then
she
offered
her
cheek
to
salvé
and
was
a
little
surprised
when
he
seemed
not
to
understand
her
meaning
and
nodded
merely
as
he
said
half
in
english
half
in
spanish
good
evening
señorita
it
seemed
to
remind
her
however
that
in
her
eagerness
she
had
forgotten
her
mantilla
and
she
left
them
hastily
she
came
back
to
them
again
in
the
almost
immediately
with
bread
wine
fruit
and
lights
upon
a
tray
and
stationed
herself
then
in
a
sympathetic
attitude
with
her
arm
on
her
brother
shoulder
while
he
with
lively
gestures
recounted
his
adventures
federigo
story
seemed
to
be
reflected
from
her
face
as
from
a
living
mirror
at
one
point
her
face
became
pale
with
passion
her
black
eyes
flashed
and
she
made
a
sudden
movement
with
her
clenched
hand
in
the
air
as
if
she
were
giving
some
one
a
stab
with
a
dagger
she
threw
her
head
back
then
with
a
triumphant
scornful
laugh
that
showed
her
dazzling
white
teeth
and
salvé
inferred
that
her
brother
must
have
killed
some
person
or
other
in
monte
video
probably
in
and
that
he
was
afraid
the
police
here
in
rio
should
have
had
information
of
it
he
sat
and
gazed
at
her
she
was
a
lithe
woman
at
once
graceful
and
fully
developed
a
dark
beauty
of
the
style
peculiar
to
the
south
with
wonderful
animation
in
her
face
and
dark
flashing
eyes
at
the
same
time
the
play
of
her
features
was
not
pleasing
salvé
thought
it
reminded
him
too
much
of
her
brother
it
was
not
feminine
and
he
was
further
repelled
by
the
way
in
which
she
repeatedly
allowed
her
eyes
to
rest
upon
him
he
did
know
why
but
elizabeth
deep
true
northern
face
came
so
vividly
before
him
then
that
he
felt
he
could
have
drawn
it
to
the
life
the
not
very
flattering
expression
which
this
comparison
had
caused
his
face
unconsciously
to
assume
as
he
looked
at
her
was
caught
unfortunately
by
paolina
as
she
was
on
the
point
of
tendering
him
her
thanks
in
her
impetuous
way
for
what
she
heard
he
had
done
for
her
brother
she
stopped
short
in
surprise
and
evidently
repressed
a
vehemently
resentful
impulse
while
a
look
unpleasant
for
him
came
into
her
eyes
she
went
over
then
and
took
him
by
the
hand
in
the
same
way
she
had
seen
him
take
her
own
on
his
arrival
and
spoke
coldly
enough
a
few
words
which
were
meant
to
convey
her
thanks
she
did
look
at
him
again
not
even
when
she
presently
said
to
him
after
having
woke
up
the
old
mulatto
woman
who
with
herself
and
her
mother
were
the
only
other
inhabitants
of
the
house
and
told
her
to
make
up
a
couple
of
mat
beds
in
the
adjoining
room
federigo
had
before
that
gone
in
to
his
mother
and
they
could
be
heard
in
eager
conversation
in
salvé
mind
a
new
impulse
had
been
unexpectedly
given
to
thoughts
from
which
the
novelty
of
his
situation
should
have
afforded
him
at
least
a
temporary
relief
and
he
lay
long
awake
thinking
drearily
about
elizabeth
when
he
did
fall
asleep
at
last
he
dreamed
that
he
had
come
into
a
serpent
nest
and
that
he
was
engaged
in
a
life
and
death
conflict
with
a
huge
snake
that
was
thrusting
its
forked
tongue
at
him
from
walls
from
roof
from
every
side
and
in
the
gleam
of
its
vindictive
eyes
he
seemed
all
at
once
to
recognise
paolina
chapter
xiv
with
a
view
to
bring
himself
into
harmony
with
his
surroundings
he
appeared
next
day
in
his
suit
of
fine
blue
cloth
which
he
had
brought
with
him
in
his
bundle
together
with
sundry
other
articles
and
what
money
he
had
still
remaining
from
the
pay
which
he
had
received
at
monte
video
that
he
looked
well
in
his
handsome
sailor
dress
was
evident
enough
from
the
surprised
look
with
which
he
was
greeted
by
mother
when
he
was
presented
to
her
she
had
evidently
expected
to
see
in
her
son
friend
something
in
the
style
of
the
raw
brazilian
sailor
a
class
of
men
who
down
there
were
generally
drawn
from
the
lowest
dregs
of
the
populace
she
herself
was
a
withered
old
woman
yellow
as
parchment
with
a
mass
of
thick
grey
hair
gathered
in
a
single
knot
at
the
back
of
her
head
she
wore
heavy
rings
on
her
fingers
and
large
earrings
her
small
piercing
eyes
had
a
look
of
passion
and
her
countenance
wore
in
a
stronger
degree
the
furtive
ratlike
expression
which
her
occasionally
displayed
as
regards
her
further
characteristics
salvé
soon
perceived
that
she
was
addicted
to
drink
she
used
to
remain
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
on
the
shady
side
of
the
house
or
on
the
little
veranda
with
acachacas
and
water
by
her
side
and
incessantly
smoking
and
rolling
cigarettes
and
she
was
often
quite
drunk
as
she
mumbled
her
ave
maria
and
told
her
beads
on
her
knees
before
going
to
bed
in
the
evening
still
the
other
inmates
of
the
house
appeared
to
have
great
respect
for
her
and
it
was
evident
that
she
held
the
threads
of
whatever
business
they
might
have
on
hand
the
señorita
was
out
all
the
morning
with
the
old
mulatto
woman
making
purchases
for
the
house
federigo
said
and
informing
herself
as
to
what
activity
was
being
shown
in
their
pursuit
when
she
returned
she
avoided
addressing
herself
directly
to
salvé
and
he
observed
that
she
handed
over
a
quantity
of
money
to
her
brother
which
had
the
happy
effect
of
bringing
into
his
countenance
a
more
cheerful
look
than
it
had
hitherto
worn
that
morning
what
have
you
done
to
my
sister
federigo
asked
one
day
laughing
you
are
not
in
her
good
graces
she
is
dangerous
he
said
seriously
and
added
then
as
if
speculating
on
possibilities
as
long
as
you
are
in
this
house
at
all
events
you
are
safe
but
mind
you
are
warned
federigo
soon
began
to
weary
of
their
enforced
confinement
to
the
house
and
in
spite
of
his
sister
efforts
to
dissuade
him
began
to
go
out
in
the
evenings
coming
home
very
late
and
in
a
gloomy
irritable
humour
evidently
from
the
casual
remarks
he
let
fall
having
lost
all
his
money
at
play
the
second
morning
of
his
stay
in
the
house
salvé
had
perceived
that
there
was
a
want
of
money
and
having
heard
the
brother
and
sister
quarrelling
one
day
when
both
were
in
a
bad
humour
he
thought
it
best
to
carry
out
at
the
first
convenient
moment
the
determination
at
which
he
had
arrived
and
handed
over
to
federigo
what
money
he
had
with
the
exception
of
a
single
silver
piastre
saying
that
it
was
only
right
he
should
pay
for
his
lodging
and
board
the
money
though
deprecatingly
was
still
accepted
and
in
the
evening
federigo
was
out
once
more
his
sister
remaining
at
home
she
and
salvé
on
account
of
their
ignorance
of
each
other
language
could
not
hold
much
conversation
together
and
salvé
was
rather
glad
of
this
wall
of
separation
between
them
as
it
left
him
more
at
his
ease
she
had
however
recently
looked
more
often
at
him
with
a
sort
of
interest
and
on
several
occasions
had
put
questions
to
him
through
her
brother
her
range
of
ideas
was
apparently
not
extensive
as
her
questions
always
turned
upon
the
same
topic
namely
what
the
women
were
like
in
his
country
so
that
he
soon
came
to
know
by
heart
all
the
spanish
terms
which
related
to
that
subject
they
were
out
on
the
veranda
together
that
evening
and
as
she
went
past
his
back
while
he
was
leaning
over
in
his
seat
she
drew
her
hand
as
if
by
accident
lightly
through
his
hair
if
it
had
had
the
electricity
of
a
cat
it
would
have
given
out
a
perfect
shower
of
sparks
so
enraged
was
he
at
the
advance
when
federigo
came
home
he
flung
his
hat
away
angrily
on
to
a
chair
and
drank
down
at
a
gulp
a
glass
of
rum
that
was
standing
on
the
table
he
no
longer
wore
the
smart
cloak
he
had
on
when
he
went
out
i
have
gambled
away
all
your
money
he
cried
in
english
to
salvé
as
if
careless
of
further
reticence
and
made
some
remark
then
with
an
unpleasant
laugh
to
his
sister
who
had
evidently
by
her
expression
perceived
at
once
how
matters
stood
there
my
last
piastre
for
you
said
salvé
throwing
it
over
to
him
try
your
luck
with
it
he
is
successful
in
love
said
paolina
tearfully
and
with
a
affectation
of
superstition
he
is
engaged
when
her
brother
who
was
balancing
the
piastre
on
his
forefinger
laughingly
translated
what
she
had
said
salvé
replied
snappishly
with
an
impatient
glance
at
the
señorita
i
am
not
engaged
and
never
shall
be
unsuccessful
in
love
she
broke
out
gleefully
and
the
last
piastre
we
shall
win
a
hundred
two
hundred
federigo
it
was
clearly
the
conviction
of
her
heart
and
she
seized
a
mandolin
and
began
to
dance
to
her
own
accompaniment
her
eyes
resting
as
she
did
so
upon
salvé
with
a
peculiar
expression
quick
federigo
why
not
this
evening
she
cried
breaking
off
suddenly
with
a
laugh
and
throwing
the
mandolin
from
her
on
to
the
sofa
his
luck
may
be
gone
she
seized
her
brother
hat
crushed
it
down
upon
his
head
and
pushed
him
eagerly
out
of
the
door
going
with
him
herself
to
open
the
wicket
she
came
back
then
to
salvé
and
as
they
sat
in
the
lamplit
room
with
doors
and
windows
thrown
wide
open
the
moonlight
gleaming
on
the
dark
trees
outside
and
the
night
air
perfumed
with
the
scent
of
flowers
she
endeavoured
to
ingratiate
herself
with
him
by
pouring
out
his
and
by
rolling
his
cigarettes
an
art
in
which
it
appeared
from
her
laughter
and
gestures
that
she
thought
him
awkward
she
was
in
a
state
of
feverish
excitement
and
kept
darting
off
to
the
wicket
and
back
again
salvé
sat
and
smoked
and
sipped
his
glass
unconcernedly
whilst
she
rocked
herself
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
with
her
head
thrown
back
and
her
eyes
steadily
fixed
upon
him
he
heard
a
sigh
and
she
said
in
a
low
ingratiating
tone
i
am
afraid
federigo
is
unlucky
salvé
was
not
so
stupid
as
not
to
comprehend
her
meaning
he
was
quite
aware
that
she
was
handsome
as
she
sat
there
with
her
hand
on
her
knee
and
her
foot
gracefully
brought
into
view
but
his
feeling
was
exclusively
one
of
indignation
that
such
a
common
brazilian
baggage
should
presume
to
bring
herself
into
comparison
with
elizabeth
he
flung
away
his
cigar
impatiently
and
went
down
into
the
garden
without
attempting
to
conceal
his
aversion
he
hated
all
women
since
the
one
he
had
fixed
his
heart
on
had
disappointed
him
and
he
strode
backwards
and
forwards
now
in
more
than
usual
indignation
against
the
sex
he
was
still
pacing
the
garden
when
federigo
came
back
heated
and
triumphant
with
his
cloak
on
his
shoulder
and
a
bag
under
his
arm
nearly
three
hundred
piastres
he
cried
clearing
the
garden
in
a
succession
of
bounds
his
sister
had
been
asleep
on
the
sofa
and
sprang
up
in
ecstasy
at
the
intelligence
and
they
proceeded
then
with
childish
glee
to
spread
out
the
silver
on
the
table
and
divide
it
into
three
when
salvé
absolutely
refused
to
take
more
than
his
one
piastre
back
again
there
came
actually
a
look
of
humble
admiration
into
the
señorita
eyes
she
could
not
comprehend
such
an
act
of
although
she
seemed
to
vaguely
feel
that
there
was
something
noble
about
it
after
a
consideration
she
held
out
her
hand
and
said
señor
give
me
the
piastre
you
have
in
your
hand
and
i
will
give
you
another
in
return
for
it
he
did
so
and
she
took
it
and
kissed
it
repeatedly
i
shall
play
with
this
one
evening
she
cried
joyfully
and
put
it
into
her
bosom
she
carried
out
her
intention
and
came
home
beaming
with
a
whole
bagful
of
piastres
it
seemed
that
the
family
lived
only
by
play
the
son
it
is
true
was
in
connection
with
one
or
other
of
the
political
parties
of
the
town
with
the
prospect
of
an
appointment
as
officer
in
a
volunteer
corps
if
any
rising
took
place
but
that
did
not
in
the
meantime
bring
in
money
and
how
they
managed
to
get
along
when
luck
went
against
them
it
was
not
easy
to
see
salvé
meanwhile
was
becoming
rather
tired
of
being
on
land
the
seclusion
had
suited
him
well
enough
at
first
until
the
señorita
had
begun
to
pay
him
attentions
but
now
that
she
evidently
remained
at
home
all
day
solely
on
his
account
to
dress
at
him
and
play
off
all
sorts
of
coquetry
upon
him
he
began
to
find
it
intolerable
and
when
the
juno
at
last
had
sailed
he
announced
one
day
that
he
meant
to
go
down
to
the
harbour
and
look
for
employment
the
señorita
turned
pale
but
soon
recovered
her
and
even
joked
with
him
about
it
and
later
on
her
brother
persuaded
him
to
defer
his
intention
for
three
days
until
he
had
attended
a
gathering
of
federigo
friends
which
was
to
take
place
one
night
down
in
one
of
the
suburbs
that
evening
when
her
brother
had
gone
out
as
usual
to
play
the
señorita
sat
down
in
the
window
of
the
room
where
salvé
was
and
through
which
he
would
have
to
pass
to
go
into
the
garden
she
had
undone
her
luxuriant
hair
and
had
put
on
a
languishing
look
and
every
now
and
then
thrummed
absently
on
her
guitar
humming
gently
to
herself
as
she
fixed
her
black
eyes
upon
him
salvé
saw
himself
in
a
manner
besieged
and
felt
half
inclined
to
brush
past
her
and
escape
into
the
garden
but
it
would
have
seemed
too
deliberately
unfriendly
the
only
sign
which
betrayed
his
consciousness
of
the
situation
was
the
somewhat
hasty
way
in
which
he
puffed
his
cigarette
you
really
mean
to
leave
us
she
said
at
last
sadly
in
almost
a
beseeching
tone
yes
señorita
was
the
reply
and
evidently
it
came
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
was
angry
and
weary
of
her
importunity
he
had
hardly
said
it
before
thrusting
her
hand
into
her
bosom
she
had
sprung
to
her
feet
and
a
stiletto
whizzed
past
his
ear
and
stuck
quivering
in
the
wall
close
to
his
head
her
supple
body
was
still
in
motion
her
face
was
pale
and
her
eyes
were
flashing
then
with
a
sudden
transition
she
threw
herself
back
and
laughed
were
you
frightened
she
cried
but
salvé
showed
no
sign
of
it
he
was
provoked
but
cool
and
not
being
the
kind
of
man
who
would
deign
to
engage
in
a
conflict
with
a
woman
he
left
the
stiletto
sticking
in
the
wall
though
at
first
he
had
thought
of
seizing
it
look
here
she
said
suddenly
darting
over
and
drawing
it
out
and
then
practising
with
it
laughing
all
the
while
at
various
spots
on
the
walls
of
the
room
which
she
hit
every
time
to
a
nicety
you
were
frightened
confess
that
you
were
she
said
teasingly
sitting
down
opposite
to
him
heated
with
the
exercise
she
had
gone
through
she
gazed
into
his
face
with
her
cheek
resting
on
her
hand
and
her
elbow
on
the
table
you
were
afraid
and
now
you
are
angry
the
women
in
your
country
do
do
such
things
salvé
turned
to
her
with
a
look
of
icy
rebuff
no
señorita
he
replied
curtly
and
went
down
into
the
garden
thereupon
she
seized
the
guitar
again
and
began
strumming
an
accompaniment
apparently
to
her
thoughts
it
was
no
longer
lively
music
she
played
but
something
of
a
menacing
strain
in
keeping
with
the
look
in
her
eyes
and
she
seemed
in
a
manner
to
hiss
the
air
through
her
teeth
later
on
in
the
evening
she
came
tripping
over
to
him
with
a
coquettish
smile
and
after
the
custom
of
the
country
offered
him
a
cigarette
which
she
had
begun
to
smoke
herself
when
he
rather
ungallantly
declined
it
she
exclaimed
furiously
stamping
her
foot
señor
but
she
recovered
herself
in
a
moment
and
said
laughing
with
at
all
events
apparent
something
which
meant
that
she
understood
that
this
might
perhaps
not
be
a
custom
in
his
country
salvé
felt
much
relieved
when
her
brother
came
home
and
told
him
that
the
meeting
he
was
waiting
for
was
to
take
place
on
the
following
evening
chapter
xv
it
was
into
a
tavern
with
two
or
three
rooms
leading
out
of
one
another
that
his
friend
then
conducted
him
men
of
the
most
various
social
positions
many
with
a
military
look
and
in
uniforms
filled
the
inner
rooms
and
in
the
outer
one
he
had
seen
upon
entering
a
number
of
seafaring
men
who
looked
like
americans
and
who
nodded
to
him
on
the
strength
of
his
sailor
dress
there
were
several
women
more
or
less
well
dressed
moving
about
among
them
and
others
standing
with
eager
faces
over
the
in
the
inner
room
all
were
drinking
acachacas
and
the
whole
place
was
pervaded
with
a
cloud
of
out
of
which
there
came
a
deafening
clamour
of
talk
salvé
had
a
seat
found
for
him
by
his
friend
at
a
long
table
amongst
a
number
of
bronzed
bearded
men
with
large
hats
leather
breeches
and
spurs
whose
company
he
by
no
means
cared
about
they
looked
like
mounted
such
as
he
had
seen
at
monte
video
or
still
more
perhaps
like
brigands
or
banditti
they
belong
to
mendez
volunteer
corps
whispered
federigo
as
he
presented
him
then
to
the
chief
of
the
party
who
sat
at
the
top
of
the
table
a
powerful
fellow
with
a
complexion
heavy
black
mustachios
and
a
pair
of
small
active
eyes
which
more
than
once
afterwards
when
salvé
was
not
looking
were
turned
critically
upon
him
every
now
and
then
they
clinked
their
glasses
together
to
some
party
toast
but
otherwise
they
were
quiet
enough
at
first
people
of
the
same
calibre
sat
round
other
tables
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
and
at
another
were
intermingled
persons
from
the
town
who
were
carrying
on
a
whispered
conversation
and
who
appeared
anxious
the
shouting
and
the
noise
and
the
laughter
kept
increasing
there
were
already
drunken
faces
at
the
table
and
in
several
directions
quarrelling
and
the
sound
of
blows
were
beginning
to
be
heard
federigo
who
seemed
to
be
known
to
many
in
the
rooms
had
mixed
with
the
crowd
and
salvé
neighbours
on
either
side
were
now
playing
eagerly
with
dice
diving
from
time
to
time
for
small
silver
pieces
into
heavy
leathern
purses
that
seemed
to
have
been
destined
for
sums
very
different
from
what
their
present
meagre
contents
represented
so
many
debased
avaricious
countenances
as
he
saw
around
him
he
had
never
imagined
that
it
would
be
possible
to
collect
in
one
spot
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
have
no
more
to
do
with
them
than
he
could
possibly
help
he
might
congratulate
himself
he
thought
if
he
escaped
from
them
with
a
whole
skin
and
he
felt
in
his
to
see
that
his
knife
was
there
one
of
the
north
americans
who
had
nodded
to
him
in
virtue
of
his
sailor
dress
when
he
entered
came
over
to
him
now
and
asked
him
to
come
and
sit
with
them
but
as
he
rather
felt
himself
under
charge
he
declined
just
then
shortly
after
to
his
surprise
he
saw
the
señorita
standing
at
the
with
her
head
which
was
all
he
could
see
beautifully
dressed
and
he
observed
that
the
eyes
of
the
keeper
of
the
tavern
a
tall
lean
portuguese
with
a
long
sallow
face
and
hardly
any
hair
on
his
head
who
himself
presided
at
the
table
were
turned
towards
her
continually
with
a
look
of
humble
tender
concern
she
was
playing
excitedly
and
losing
every
time
at
last
she
stopped
in
evident
irritation
and
beckoned
him
to
one
side
with
a
certain
authority
in
spite
of
his
having
the
table
to
attend
to
they
spoke
eagerly
together
and
salvé
caught
a
rapid
glance
directed
towards
himself
by
the
señorita
which
he
did
not
at
all
like
she
was
unnaturally
pale
and
he
saw
that
she
finally
gave
the
other
her
hand
which
he
kissed
with
an
enraptured
expression
and
she
then
disappeared
from
the
room
the
landlord
face
beamed
the
whole
evening
afterwards
and
he
bowed
politely
to
federigo
as
he
passed
the
table
the
latter
the
next
time
he
came
near
salvé
whispered
rather
scornfully
i
believe
my
sister
has
bartered
away
her
soul
this
evening
and
promised
to
marry
that
old
there
who
keeps
the
tavern
congratulate
us
salvé
observed
that
the
said
conferred
now
more
than
once
with
the
man
at
the
head
of
his
own
table
and
was
apparently
making
terms
with
him
and
that
the
latter
also
when
he
thought
he
was
not
observed
glanced
over
at
himself
in
a
way
that
was
very
far
from
putting
him
at
his
ease
the
american
who
had
spoken
to
him
before
a
tall
man
with
a
fair
beard
round
a
hard
yankee
face
and
with
a
remnant
of
gold
lace
on
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
had
since
been
at
the
and
had
been
losing
one
doubloon
after
another
they
do
play
fair
my
lad
he
cried
in
english
to
salvé
to
whom
he
seemed
anxious
to
make
up
i
daresay
not
was
the
reply
it
a
vile
den
what
country
do
you
hail
from
norway
ah
norwegian
good
sailors
deserted
at
rio
he
asked
then
with
a
laugh
as
if
he
expected
as
a
matter
of
course
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
shall
i
play
for
you
he
asked
presently
no
money
here
a
guinea
on
account
of
your
wages
on
board
the
and
stripes
for
valparaiso
and
chinchas
he
cried
with
a
laugh
that
was
heard
above
the
surrounding
din
and
flinging
a
gold
piece
on
the
table
he
lost
it
he
turned
and
putting
his
hand
to
his
mouth
shouted
one
more
on
account
and
another
gold
piece
shared
the
fate
of
the
first
one
more
on
account
there
came
again
and
with
the
same
result
salvé
had
by
this
time
had
about
enough
of
this
and
undesired
playing
on
his
account
the
man
face
moreover
with
all
its
joviality
by
no
means
attracted
him
and
he
shouted
to
him
in
a
tone
play
for
yourself
yankee
the
american
seemed
not
to
be
able
to
hear
on
that
side
for
he
repeated
coolly
nodding
to
him
one
more
on
account
salvé
patience
was
exhausted
he
had
been
sitting
all
this
time
squeezed
up
in
the
narrow
space
between
the
bench
and
the
wall
with
people
on
both
sides
of
him
preventing
his
getting
out
but
now
grasping
his
neighbour
violently
by
the
shoulder
he
sprang
all
at
once
across
the
table
and
over
to
the
unabashed
yankee
with
an
irresistible
feeling
that
come
what
might
he
would
get
out
into
the
freedom
of
the
open
air
once
more
just
then
there
came
from
the
furthest
room
a
cry
of
police
the
lights
in
that
room
were
at
once
extinguished
and
a
moment
after
those
in
the
room
where
salvé
was
on
the
point
of
falling
foul
of
the
american
who
to
his
great
surprise
found
him
all
of
a
sudden
confronting
him
went
out
also
their
hostile
relations
however
were
almost
immediately
turned
into
friendly
ones
for
salvé
who
had
seen
the
landlord
making
a
rush
towards
him
felt
himself
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
caused
by
the
darkness
seized
by
two
men
and
forced
towards
a
door
leading
in
another
direction
than
that
in
which
he
saw
the
stream
was
setting
and
which
no
doubt
was
the
way
out
help
yankee
there
some
villany
on
here
the
small
door
to
the
right
he
shouted
with
great
presence
of
mind
and
at
the
same
moment
the
door
was
slammed
behind
him
a
handkerchief
was
tied
over
his
mouth
he
was
tripped
up
and
brought
heavily
to
the
ground
where
his
feet
and
hands
were
tied
and
he
was
then
shot
into
a
dark
which
seemed
to
be
at
the
back
of
a
press
that
was
unlatched
to
pass
him
through
h
said
the
yankee
coolly
to
himself
i
am
not
going
to
lose
his
pay
if
i
know
it
and
he
set
out
accordingly
in
search
of
the
police
with
whom
he
had
no
outstanding
account
salvé
was
certain
he
had
heard
the
señorita
voice
whispering
in
the
outer
room
and
not
long
after
he
heard
the
latch
in
the
press
raised
and
she
stood
before
him
with
a
light
she
looked
at
him
mischievously
and
spilt
some
oil
out
of
the
lamp
on
to
his
face
with
a
little
scornful
laugh
but
her
expression
changed
then
to
that
of
a
tigress
burning
for
revenge
that
is
compelled
to
put
off
the
gratification
of
her
fury
and
she
darted
out
again
clapping
down
the
latch
behind
her
salvé
lay
tightly
bound
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
but
his
suppleness
enabled
him
eventually
to
wriggle
his
out
of
his
breast
pocket
and
he
found
no
great
difficulty
then
in
freeing
himself
from
his
bonds
he
stood
now
with
his
knife
in
his
hand
and
listened
before
long
he
heard
the
american
voice
with
the
police
and
they
appeared
to
be
searching
he
shouted
to
them
and
the
next
moment
he
was
released
he
is
one
of
our
crew
belongs
to
the
stars
and
stripes
said
the
american
arresting
salvé
who
as
long
as
he
got
out
of
this
accursed
town
now
did
not
care
in
what
capacity
it
might
be
and
offered
no
opposition
you
have
not
improved
your
beauty
my
lad
said
his
rescuer
derisively
as
he
held
up
the
light
to
his
face
i
should
like
to
have
one
word
with
the
before
i
go
said
salvé
and
that
is
what
we
have
not
the
slightest
inclination
for
said
the
american
who
it
now
appeared
was
boatswain
on
board
in
a
dry
tone
of
authority
we
are
not
going
larking
with
the
police
besides
having
once
recovered
that
trifle
of
wages
i
do
mean
to
risk
losing
it
again
the
yankees
made
a
close
ring
round
their
prisoner
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
follow
as
he
was
directed
a
look
however
at
the
boatswain
gave
him
to
understand
that
that
question
of
the
wages
would
be
settled
between
them
when
they
got
on
board
chapter
xvi
the
stars
and
stripes
lay
in
the
roads
with
the
union
flag
at
her
gaff
she
was
a
long
black
and
at
the
vessel
with
a
crew
of
men
and
salvé
was
so
taken
with
her
appearance
that
as
they
came
alongside
he
silently
congratulated
himself
on
his
luck
in
getting
a
berth
in
her
they
were
so
obliging
moreover
as
to
give
him
a
berth
to
himself
in
a
separate
cabin
below
but
to
his
intense
indignation
no
sooner
had
he
entered
it
than
the
door
was
latched
on
the
outside
and
when
he
tried
to
kick
it
open
it
was
signified
to
him
that
during
the
short
time
they
had
still
to
be
at
rio
he
was
to
remain
in
confinement
that
they
might
be
sure
of
him
the
heat
was
intolerable
down
there
and
to
add
to
that
there
was
incessant
crying
and
groaning
going
on
in
the
hold
beside
him
as
if
it
were
full
of
sick
people
it
was
the
vilest
treatment
he
had
ever
been
subjected
to
the
work
of
taking
in
the
cargo
went
on
uninterruptedly
the
whole
night
as
if
they
were
in
a
particular
hurry
to
get
out
of
the
harbour
and
about
noon
the
anchor
was
weighed
while
the
contents
of
the
last
lighter
were
being
taken
on
board
when
salvé
some
hours
after
was
set
at
liberty
they
were
already
out
in
the
open
sea
off
the
mouth
of
the
channel
the
captain
the
three
mates
and
several
of
the
inferiors
in
command
when
on
deck
wore
caps
and
a
kind
of
uniform
as
on
a
and
the
officer
of
the
watch
was
armed
the
crew
on
the
other
hand
were
almost
to
a
man
shabby
and
they
seemed
to
consist
of
men
of
every
nationality
english
irish
germans
and
americans
not
to
mention
half
a
dozen
negroes
and
mulattoes
as
no
one
took
any
notice
of
him
he
went
about
as
he
pleased
for
a
while
and
presently
saw
with
a
disagreeable
sensation
no
less
than
three
corpses
carelessly
sewed
up
in
dropped
over
the
side
of
the
ship
that
was
turned
from
the
land
without
the
slightest
ceremony
the
uncomfortable
feeling
which
this
incident
had
aroused
was
anything
but
allayed
when
he
heard
presently
from
a
little
pale
with
whom
he
had
entered
into
conversation
that
it
had
been
successfully
concealed
from
the
harbour
authorities
that
there
was
yellow
fever
on
board
that
there
were
many
more
lying
sick
below
and
that
one
of
those
who
had
just
been
heaved
overboard
had
died
the
day
before
in
the
very
berth
in
which
salvé
had
slept
that
night
in
the
evening
he
was
called
aft
to
the
captain
who
was
standing
with
the
boatswain
at
his
elbow
he
was
a
spare
man
of
about
forty
years
of
age
with
thick
black
whiskers
marked
features
and
rather
hollow
cheeks
and
with
carefully
dressed
glossy
hair
he
was
smoking
a
handsome
pipe
with
a
long
stem
inlaid
with
and
took
a
sip
from
time
to
time
from
a
cup
of
black
coffee
that
was
standing
on
the
skylight
what
is
your
name
he
asked
nodding
in
reply
to
salvé
salute
salvé
salvé
repeated
the
captain
with
an
english
pronunciation
of
the
name
and
norwegian
he
looks
too
respectable
for
the
pack
he
have
to
herd
with
he
muttered
to
the
boatswain
able
seaman
yes
you
have
had
three
guineas
on
account
he
went
on
after
a
couple
of
puffs
to
keep
his
pipe
alight
as
he
looked
into
his
ledger
a
wages
no
sir
said
salvé
firmly
i
have
had
nothing
on
account
and
he
proceeded
then
to
relate
the
circumstances
under
which
the
supposed
payment
had
been
made
i
have
not
been
regularly
engaged
till
this
moment
if
i
am
so
now
but
up
to
this
i
have
been
treated
like
a
dog
and
worse
the
captain
took
no
notice
of
his
last
observation
and
merely
said
shortly
and
sternly
the
three
guineas
are
owing
to
him
boatswain
jenkins
his
place
will
be
in
the
foretop
a
steady
hand
will
be
wanted
among
all
that
rabble
there
another
time
you
perhaps
play
on
your
own
account
and
not
on
the
sailors
he
observed
turning
to
the
boatswain
but
salvé
caught
the
remark
with
this
the
conference
came
to
an
end
the
boatswain
expression
prophesying
that
when
the
opportunity
offered
salvé
should
pay
for
his
triumph
he
went
about
nursing
his
prominent
chin
and
twisting
his
yellow
whiskers
and
found
a
victim
for
the
present
in
a
wretched
mulatto
who
was
scouring
for
the
cook
after
first
correcting
him
sharply
for
nothing
he
coolly
felled
him
to
the
deck
with
a
handspike
and
left
him
lying
there
unable
to
move
salvé
blood
boiled
at
the
sight
but
his
indignation
gave
way
presently
to
astonishment
when
he
saw
the
poor
fellow
get
up
and
go
on
indefatigably
with
his
work
after
first
quietly
wiping
his
own
blood
off
the
saucepan
there
was
a
limit
to
brutality
he
thought
and
in
his
disgust
he
almost
envied
him
the
blow
he
had
received
he
provided
himself
now
from
the
purser
with
a
suit
of
seaman
clothes
in
lieu
of
the
rather
damaged
cloth
ones
which
he
wore
and
the
sailmaker
gave
him
out
hammock
clothes
to
be
paid
for
out
of
his
wages
he
proceeded
then
to
hang
his
hammock
from
one
of
the
beams
between
decks
and
while
he
was
doing
so
observed
another
man
in
a
canvas
suit
like
his
own
similarly
occupied
not
far
from
him
he
could
be
mistaken
it
was
federigo
the
latter
had
as
salvé
afterwards
heard
been
taken
by
the
police
during
the
affair
in
the
tavern
he
had
seen
how
salvé
had
been
rescued
by
the
boatswain
of
the
stars
and
stripes
and
having
managed
to
escape
from
his
captors
on
the
way
to
the
he
had
sought
a
similar
refuge
salvé
indignation
at
his
sister
baseness
was
still
too
fresh
for
federigo
reappearance
to
be
in
any
way
agreeable
to
him
although
he
believed
him
to
be
innocent
of
any
complicity
in
that
business
at
the
same
time
the
latter
conscience
was
apparently
not
entirely
clear
in
the
matter
for
there
was
a
certain
conscious
sense
of
humiliation
in
his
expression
combined
with
something
which
made
salvé
feel
that
he
must
be
upon
his
guard
neither
spoke
to
the
other
and
it
might
have
been
supposed
from
their
bearing
towards
one
another
that
they
had
never
met
before
it
very
soon
became
clear
to
salvé
that
he
could
not
have
hit
upon
a
more
unfortunate
ship
the
crew
was
composed
of
the
dregs
of
the
new
orleans
and
charleston
docks
men
with
every
species
of
vice
and
degradation
stamped
upon
their
countenances
and
amongst
whom
every
second
word
was
some
infamous
oath
or
blasphemy
blows
with
handspikes
were
of
common
occurrence
and
brutality
and
violence
generally
were
the
order
of
the
day
there
was
no
court
of
appeal
and
the
immunity
which
any
one
individual
might
enjoy
depended
entirely
upon
how
far
he
was
protected
by
the
officers
who
however
in
a
general
way
did
not
interfere
in
the
quarrels
forward
or
had
formed
a
league
with
others
the
americans
and
the
irish
banded
together
and
being
the
most
numerous
practised
a
shameless
system
of
tyranny
against
any
who
could
not
defend
themselves
a
miserable
sickly
spaniard
who
had
been
forced
to
work
until
he
had
actually
dropped
having
recently
been
more
especially
the
object
of
their
attentions
their
supremacy
however
was
contested
by
a
party
of
seven
or
eight
tattered
countrymen
of
the
latter
with
one
or
two
portuguese
who
were
always
ready
with
their
knives
and
who
formed
a
sort
of
opposition
to
this
party
federigo
had
attached
himself
salvé
stood
alone
the
americans
and
irish
had
at
first
reckoned
upon
having
him
with
them
but
had
gradually
turned
against
him
they
had
taken
offence
at
his
apparent
disinclination
to
associate
with
them
more
than
he
could
help
he
seemed
to
think
himself
too
good
for
them
and
in
addition
to
that
the
qualities
which
he
displayed
made
them
dislike
him
out
of
envy
but
their
hostility
was
perhaps
mainly
due
to
the
boatswain
who
encouraged
the
idea
among
the
rest
of
the
crew
that
he
was
favoured
by
the
officers
federigo
came
out
now
in
an
unexpectedly
friendly
light
and
salvé
perceived
that
it
was
only
owing
to
him
that
all
the
portuguese
were
not
against
him
also
the
result
was
that
the
two
gradually
approached
such
other
again
there
were
of
course
in
such
a
collection
of
individual
bullies
whose
hands
were
against
every
man
but
who
to
some
extent
kept
each
other
in
check
the
one
most
feared
of
these
was
a
huge
scarred
irishman
who
seemed
periodically
to
be
possessed
by
a
very
demon
of
violence
and
to
be
actually
running
over
with
bad
blood
he
had
been
in
irons
for
some
time
before
the
vessel
arrived
at
rio
for
having
one
day
sworn
on
deck
that
he
would
murder
the
captain
it
was
with
this
ruffian
that
salvé
had
first
to
measure
himself
the
boatswain
being
the
immediate
cause
one
day
when
the
large
bell
forward
had
rung
for
dinner
the
boatswain
gave
an
order
which
detained
salvé
for
some
time
after
the
others
had
taken
their
places
at
the
long
table
in
the
and
when
he
came
in
everything
was
eaten
up
and
he
lost
his
dinner
the
following
day
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
and
he
had
to
content
himself
with
his
breakfast
and
supper
rations
for
the
day
he
perfectly
understood
the
meaning
of
it
in
smartness
and
activity
he
was
so
far
beyond
comparison
superior
to
any
of
the
other
foretop
hands
that
the
boatswain
had
not
been
able
to
find
any
excuse
for
subjecting
him
to
punishment
he
was
going
to
try
and
hit
him
in
another
way
on
his
lonely
watch
that
night
salvé
decided
what
he
should
do
if
the
trick
was
practised
a
third
time
upon
him
it
would
be
better
to
bring
things
to
a
crisis
at
once
than
have
his
strength
gradually
exhausted
by
continued
insufficiency
of
food
the
same
order
being
given
at
the
same
time
next
day
he
carried
it
out
as
speedily
as
he
could
and
hurried
on
then
to
the
where
the
others
were
already
at
their
dinner
with
a
bowl
of
meat
and
soup
to
every
two
men
he
sat
down
by
the
side
of
the
irishman
who
he
saw
had
a
bowl
to
himself
put
the
bowl
this
way
he
said
coolly
the
irishman
merely
looked
at
him
contemptuously
he
was
evidently
astonished
at
his
audacity
but
went
on
eating
composedly
salvé
felt
that
he
must
not
be
beaten
life
for
life
irishman
he
cried
springing
to
his
feet
and
as
the
other
also
rose
giving
him
a
blow
in
the
face
that
sent
him
backwards
on
the
bench
against
the
wall
a
fierce
conflict
now
ensued
the
irishman
got
up
like
a
bleeding
ox
and
catching
up
a
that
was
hanging
from
the
beam
gave
salvé
a
deep
wound
in
the
cheek
the
scar
of
which
he
carried
his
whole
life
through
they
drew
their
knives
then
and
salvé
coolness
and
activity
soon
gave
him
the
superiority
over
his
furious
and
unwieldy
opponent
his
movements
were
like
those
of
a
steel
spring
and
pale
and
smiling
he
delivered
every
blow
with
such
effect
that
the
affair
ended
with
the
irishman
bleeding
profusely
and
tumbling
out
of
the
narrow
doorway
to
save
himself
there
were
not
a
few
who
were
glad
enough
that
the
dreaded
irishman
should
have
been
worsted
and
it
was
to
this
feeling
salvé
was
indebted
for
being
allowed
to
fight
it
out
alone
with
him
he
stuck
his
knife
now
into
the
table
by
the
side
of
his
dish
and
looking
round
him
asked
is
there
any
one
else
now
who
would
like
to
keep
me
out
of
my
meat
there
was
no
answer
while
i
am
about
it
he
continued
without
noticing
the
blood
that
was
running
down
his
face
and
over
his
hands
i
settle
this
matter
once
for
all
i
have
two
days
rations
owing
to
me
very
well
for
the
next
two
days
i
shall
keep
one
dish
to
myself
i
shall
see
then
what
the
irishman
or
any
one
else
thinks
of
it
the
irishman
was
confined
to
his
hammock
the
whole
week
with
and
salvé
had
for
the
first
time
won
the
respect
of
the
crew
he
felt
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
commenced
a
desperate
struggle
and
that
if
he
was
to
enjoy
any
sort
of
security
in
this
company
of
ruffians
whom
he
had
now
set
at
defiance
he
must
take
the
game
into
his
own
hands
and
make
himself
at
least
as
much
feared
as
the
irishman
had
been
accordingly
instead
of
waiting
to
be
challenged
he
deliberately
became
the
aggressor
and
set
himself
to
dispense
justice
as
he
pleased
the
one
who
next
to
the
irishman
was
most
dreaded
was
a
mulatto
who
carried
on
a
petty
system
of
pillage
against
any
one
that
was
not
supported
unluckily
for
him
by
any
party
and
salvé
himself
had
been
obliged
one
evening
to
put
up
with
having
his
hammock
taken
down
and
the
mulatto
hung
in
its
place
he
had
seen
him
in
several
fights
and
had
observed
his
peculiar
tactics
the
result
of
his
observations
being
the
conviction
that
the
man
had
not
the
strength
which
he
was
anxious
to
make
the
others
think
he
had
in
pursuance
of
this
policy
he
had
picked
a
quarrel
with
him
on
the
head
of
that
matter
of
the
hammock
and
with
a
similarly
decisive
result
the
mulatto
rejoiced
in
the
name
of
januarius
and
salvé
accordingly
requested
him
to
remember
that
there
was
something
still
owing
to
him
for
the
eleven
other
months
of
the
year
he
was
a
cur
by
nature
and
never
seemed
to
have
the
slightest
desire
to
renew
the
struggle
afterwards
which
was
not
the
case
with
the
irishman
with
whom
salvé
perceived
directly
the
man
came
on
deck
again
that
a
fresh
trial
of
strength
was
inevitable
an
opportunity
was
not
long
in
offering
and
salvé
seized
it
at
once
so
that
the
challenge
might
come
from
him
the
irishman
had
taken
a
fancy
to
the
boots
of
the
wretched
spaniard
who
was
ill
and
was
now
wearing
them
irishman
said
salvé
as
the
other
passed
him
when
they
were
lounging
about
after
dinner
that
is
an
awkward
pair
of
boots
you
have
on
there
if
you
take
my
advice
you
return
them
to
their
owner
or
i
shall
have
to
pull
them
off
you
the
irishman
glared
at
him
but
turned
pale
at
the
last
threat
and
salvé
eye
seemed
to
light
up
at
the
prospect
of
carrying
it
out
the
former
made
the
mistake
of
preparing
to
defend
himself
instead
of
taking
the
aggressive
and
in
a
moment
was
knocked
down
and
stunned
for
an
instant
by
a
couple
of
unexpected
blows
from
salvé
who
flew
at
him
like
a
the
crew
gathered
round
the
irishman
seized
a
heavy
iron
as
a
weapon
and
salvé
a
handspike
and
salvé
kept
his
word
he
pulled
the
boots
off
as
the
other
lay
senseless
on
the
deck
and
took
them
down
to
the
spaniard
in
point
of
physical
strength
salvé
was
far
from
being
the
equal
of
many
of
these
men
who
he
knew
very
well
were
now
only
looking
out
for
an
occasion
to
get
the
better
of
him
his
only
chance
was
to
take
the
initiative
on
all
occasions
and
to
seem
the
most
reckless
and
the
most
careless
of
life
and
the
most
eager
to
fight
of
them
all
he
therefore
flew
at
his
man
without
hesitation
on
the
slightest
provocation
and
whenever
he
threatened
took
care
to
keep
his
word
the
constant
strain
upon
his
energy
became
at
last
like
a
fever
in
his
blood
and
the
life
he
was
leading
began
to
show
itself
in
his
face
he
had
come
to
be
reckoned
on
board
as
one
of
those
stubborn
unruly
spirits
that
are
common
enough
among
the
dregs
of
humanity
to
be
met
with
in
ships
holds
in
that
quarter
of
the
globe
and
who
usually
end
their
career
at
the
or
by
a
bullet
from
the
revolver
in
this
very
ship
before
they
came
into
rio
at
the
time
the
irishman
had
been
put
in
irons
the
captain
had
without
any
hesitation
shot
down
from
the
yard
one
of
the
crew
whom
he
supposed
to
be
the
ringleader
of
the
mutineers
he
looked
upon
salvé
now
with
increasing
distrust
wondering
how
he
could
ever
have
been
so
mistaken
in
a
man
as
he
had
been
in
him
but
put
a
man
to
herd
with
rabble
and
it
hard
for
him
not
to
become
one
of
them
he
said
and
deteriorated
though
he
was
salvé
was
still
the
smartest
sailor
he
had
on
board
the
boatswain
kept
out
of
his
way
now
as
much
as
possible
for
he
had
heard
that
salvé
had
sworn
to
tear
his
entrails
out
if
he
gave
him
any
fresh
cause
for
offence
the
latter
knew
very
well
though
that
he
was
meditating
something
against
him
and
was
not
surprised
therefore
at
being
called
aft
one
day
to
stand
a
formal
trial
before
the
captain
for
the
expression
which
he
had
used
with
regard
to
the
boatswain
and
which
he
did
not
affect
to
deny
as
the
boatswain
he
said
had
wished
to
take
his
life
i
mean
to
leave
the
ship
he
said
the
moment
we
come
to
valparaiso
i
am
only
engaged
so
far
but
indeed
i
care
little
what
becomes
of
me
he
ended
gloomily
the
captain
probably
had
his
own
notions
with
regard
to
the
boatswain
as
salvé
escaped
the
severe
punishment
he
had
expected
and
was
only
condemned
to
solitary
confinement
for
fourteen
days
on
that
will
take
you
down
a
bit
my
lad
said
the
captain
the
boatswain
however
made
up
for
the
leniency
of
his
superior
by
a
little
ingenuity
of
his
own
and
every
day
when
salvé
was
enjoying
his
meagre
fare
in
his
place
of
confinement
the
mulatto
whom
he
had
triumphed
over
by
the
boatswain
orders
took
his
dinner
of
hot
meat
and
ate
it
outside
the
door
close
to
the
hole
through
which
the
light
was
admitted
that
the
savoury
smell
might
make
its
way
in
and
tantalise
him
at
first
salvé
rather
enjoyed
the
repose
which
his
confinement
afforded
him
but
as
his
hunger
increased
he
grew
irritable
and
at
one
day
he
approached
his
face
to
the
opening
mulatto
he
began
and
the
other
looked
up
and
grinned
with
his
white
teeth
pleased
to
see
some
sign
at
last
that
his
attentions
had
not
been
thrown
away
that
good
food
you
have
there
excellent
replied
the
other
mischievously
and
with
an
inward
chuckle
it
makes
me
picture
to
myself
your
future
salvé
continued
placidly
how
it
will
be
with
you
when
i
come
out
again
you
will
be
like
that
lobscouse
my
friend
had
that
never
occurred
to
you
the
mulatto
went
on
eating
but
grew
absent
his
nature
as
before
observed
was
not
a
courageous
one
and
it
was
obvious
that
his
food
at
last
began
to
stick
in
his
throat
it
is
much
the
same
as
if
you
were
sitting
there
and
feeding
on
yourself
said
salvé
after
a
longer
pause
during
which
he
had
watched
the
other
lengthening
countenance
that
just
what
it
will
be
my
dear
friend
unless
unless
repeated
the
mulatto
pricking
up
his
ears
unless
you
take
good
care
to
pass
your
dinner
in
here
to
me
every
day
from
this
time
there
are
only
five
days
more
and
i
have
fasted
for
nine
while
you
have
been
feeding
away
so
you
are
getting
off
cheaply
enough
if
the
boatswain
sees
you
passing
in
food
to
me
you
be
punished
so
you
will
have
to
be
cautious
and
hold
up
the
plate
yourself
before
the
opening
that
he
may
think
you
are
eating
right
in
my
face
these
were
humiliating
terms
and
the
mulatto
made
no
immediate
reply
he
merely
sat
with
his
woolly
head
bent
down
in
a
thoughtful
attitude
but
the
next
day
he
stationed
his
broad
person
with
the
plate
in
his
hand
up
in
front
of
the
opening
and
salvé
mercilessly
took
every
morsel
there
was
on
it
it
was
a
matter
of
the
last
importance
to
him
not
to
be
reduced
in
strength
as
he
knew
his
life
was
in
his
own
hands
and
that
he
was
anything
but
taken
down
and
was
as
ready
as
ever
for
a
fight
he
showed
when
he
came
out
in
a
sanguinary
encounter
which
he
engaged
in
gratuitously
for
federigo
with
one
of
the
americans
and
in
which
it
would
otherwise
undoubtedly
have
gone
hard
with
the
brazilian
it
was
not
out
of
any
respect
for
him
that
salvé
took
his
part
he
looked
upon
him
as
false
treacherous
and
entirely
unprincipled
there
was
nothing
he
did
or
said
that
did
not
seem
pervaded
with
these
characteristics
but
he
helped
him
on
the
strength
of
that
comradeship
which
among
these
reprobates
has
its
inviolable
laws
and
further
than
that
there
was
something
akin
to
a
personal
friendship
existing
between
them
federigo
was
decidedly
interesting
he
could
talk
more
or
less
on
almost
every
subject
and
he
was
full
of
theories
which
he
propounded
during
their
watches
together
and
to
which
salvé
eagerly
listened
there
was
he
said
among
other
remarks
and
in
a
superior
manner
no
such
thing
as
religion
no
such
being
as
god
such
ideas
were
only
for
dunderheads
who
moreover
in
every
country
had
their
own
particular
form
of
belief
for
the
clever
people
and
the
priests
to
turn
to
their
own
purposes
in
reference
to
that
he
told
many
stories
of
the
impositions
practised
by
the
priests
in
brazil
and
had
many
agreeable
anecdotes
too
about
the
beliefs
of
the
wretched
little
race
whose
sun
land
they
were
passing
at
the
time
he
pronounced
in
a
word
for
the
right
of
the
strongest
and
for
piastres
women
and
freedom
as
the
great
objects
of
existence
what
other
god
than
salvé
he
once
asked
ironically
had
prevented
the
irishman
from
taking
the
life
of
the
miserable
spaniard
down
there
in
the
hold
or
what
god
other
than
fear
prevented
the
boatswain
from
felling
salvé
himself
to
the
deck
with
a
handspike
although
salvé
despised
the
speaker
his
arguments
made
no
slight
impression
upon
him
what
god
he
asked
himself
would
save
him
if
he
did
not
take
care
of
himself
among
all
these
ruffians
who
surrounded
him
and
had
there
been
any
such
controlling
power
in
the
world
he
thought
with
bitterness
a
great
deal
in
his
life
would
have
been
very
different
conversations
of
this
kind
always
made
him
feel
thoroughly
bad
what
do
you
suppose
he
suddenly
asked
one
evening
as
they
were
talking
together
on
their
watch
your
sister
meant
to
do
with
me
federigo
if
i
had
not
escaped
up
to
this
they
had
avoided
touching
upon
this
tender
subject
and
federigo
answered
evasively
i
sure
i
do
know
she
takes
wild
notions
sometimes
yes
but
what
do
you
think
i
know
you
had
no
hand
in
the
matter
h
i
had
rather
not
say
replied
federigo
obviously
relieved
but
with
a
peculiar
smile
as
if
his
fancy
was
ranging
not
without
enjoyment
through
the
region
of
possibilities
she
scalded
a
monkey
once
that
had
bitten
her
slowly
to
death
with
but
her
ingenuity
was
endless
salvé
felt
a
shudder
run
through
him
and
something
in
his
face
told
the
other
that
he
had
better
not
indulge
his
fancy
any
further
and
he
hastened
therefore
to
add
half
in
joke
and
half
by
way
of
consolation
poor
antonio
varez
will
pay
for
her
having
been
obliged
to
marry
him
never
fear
yes
she
is
rich
and
happy
he
concluded
with
a
sigh
as
if
he
envied
her
and
the
subject
dropped
chapter
xvii
they
doubled
cape
horn
and
came
to
valparaiso
but
on
the
morning
they
were
to
enter
the
harbour
salvé
to
his
intense
exasperation
was
put
under
arrest
the
captain
found
him
too
useful
in
keeping
the
crew
in
order
forward
and
therefore
took
the
most
effectual
means
of
preventing
him
from
putting
into
execution
his
declared
determination
to
leave
the
ship
on
their
arrival
at
that
port
after
leaving
valparaiso
they
called
at
the
chincha
islands
took
in
a
cargo
of
guano
for
china
and
shaped
their
course
then
eastward
across
the
calm
southern
ocean
whose
lonely
monotony
was
only
broken
by
the
occasional
appearance
of
one
of
the
larger
kind
of
or
by
the
distant
spouting
of
a
whale
on
board
however
the
same
peace
was
far
from
prevailing
that
little
that
crept
like
a
dot
across
the
limitless
expanse
of
waters
was
a
little
floating
hell
where
every
evil
passion
raged
from
morning
until
night
and
it
was
only
by
secretly
fomenting
discord
and
divisions
among
the
crew
that
the
officers
could
sleep
with
any
sense
of
security
in
their
berths
as
it
was
a
large
section
of
them
with
the
irishman
at
their
head
had
a
project
on
hand
for
murdering
their
officers
and
converting
the
ship
into
a
whaling
vessel
and
even
salvé
in
moments
of
bitterness
and
indignation
at
the
tyranny
to
which
he
was
subjected
by
these
men
whose
lives
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
crew
would
sometimes
entertain
the
thought
of
joining
with
the
mutineers
who
were
restrained
from
carrying
out
their
designs
mainly
by
the
fear
which
he
had
inspired
and
by
the
refusal
of
his
sanction
many
a
desperate
struggle
with
himself
he
went
through
when
one
of
his
tyrants
passed
him
on
deck
in
the
dark
and
the
temptation
to
stick
a
knife
into
his
back
would
rise
strong
within
him
and
almost
master
him
the
other
life
hung
upon
a
hair
and
salvé
knew
it
but
that
hair
was
stronger
than
he
thought
elizabeth
face
and
the
still
unexhausted
might
of
early
impressions
made
him
always
shrink
from
the
thought
of
having
a
murder
on
his
conscience
and
to
that
depth
he
never
fell
deteriorated
though
his
character
gradually
became
from
daily
association
with
everything
that
was
vile
to
that
degree
that
he
lost
all
power
of
believing
in
the
existence
of
good
amongst
his
or
in
a
higher
power
we
need
follow
no
further
this
dark
period
of
his
life
after
a
year
and
a
half
on
board
the
stars
and
stripes
and
many
a
wild
scene
of
turbulence
and
riot
he
brought
his
connection
with
her
to
a
close
at
last
at
new
orleans
where
the
accumulation
of
his
wages
was
handed
over
to
him
the
life
on
board
the
other
vessels
in
which
he
afterwards
served
did
not
differ
greatly
from
that
which
he
had
left
but
he
had
become
accustomed
to
it
and
his
sensibilities
were
blunted
by
long
habit
it
was
not
until
some
four
years
had
thus
passed
that
he
again
began
to
feel
a
longing
for
europe
he
would
not
acknowledge
to
himself
that
it
was
norway
exactly
that
he
wanted
to
see
again
and
after
looking
out
then
for
some
time
for
a
suitable
ship
for
the
home
voyage
he
found
himself
at
last
with
his
brazilian
friend
on
board
a
large
barque
that
was
homeward
bound
from
curaçoa
with
tobacco
and
rum
for
rotterdam
and
nieuwediep
federigo
had
been
his
inseparable
companion
through
all
the
vicissitudes
of
his
southern
life
the
secret
of
his
faithful
attachment
as
salvé
suspected
being
that
the
latter
had
saved
money
which
he
had
turned
into
gold
pieces
and
kept
in
a
belt
round
his
waist
he
had
never
like
federigo
sought
occasions
to
squander
his
pay
on
land
in
gambling
or
in
other
diversions
he
hated
women
and
in
the
taverns
which
were
frequented
by
sailors
he
was
looked
upon
as
a
dangerous
customer
to
whom
it
was
prudent
to
give
as
wide
a
berth
as
possible
federigo
he
fancied
looked
upon
him
as
his
reserve
and
when
on
one
occasion
after
they
came
into
port
the
brazilian
proposed
that
they
should
desert
and
put
their
money
into
some
mines
that
were
very
favourably
reported
of
just
then
and
share
the
profits
salvé
remarked
with
perfect
composure
that
he
thought
it
highly
probable
that
if
they
started
upon
any
expedition
of
the
kind
his
friend
if
he
got
him
alone
some
fine
night
in
a
lonely
place
would
quietly
stick
his
knife
into
him
and
make
off
with
the
whole
he
therefore
declined
the
proposition
but
their
relations
nevertheless
continued
as
friendly
as
before
money
was
the
only
power
salvé
reflected
with
bitterness
and
this
satisfaction
at
least
he
could
now
enjoy
in
life
it
had
become
so
obvious
to
him
that
federigo
attachment
was
more
to
his
money
than
to
himself
that
he
determined
to
get
rid
of
his
irksome
attentions
accordingly
when
they
arrived
at
nieuwediep
he
made
all
his
arrangements
for
leaving
the
vessel
legally
this
time
without
saying
a
word
to
him
of
his
intention
and
federigo
only
heard
of
it
at
the
last
moment
when
he
met
him
coming
up
with
his
hammock
clothes
he
turned
pale
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes
whether
from
a
feeling
of
injured
friendship
or
from
disappointment
salvé
could
not
quite
make
out
the
expression
of
his
face
with
his
restless
small
black
eyes
resembled
that
of
a
disturbed
rat
at
last
he
fell
on
salvé
neck
in
his
impetuous
way
and
broke
out
but
at
any
rate
we
must
have
one
parting
glass
together
this
evening
i
do
know
how
i
shall
ever
do
without
you
it
is
so
long
now
since
we
two
have
chummed
together
against
his
better
reason
salvé
allowed
himself
to
feel
a
little
softened
at
the
thought
and
the
remembrance
of
all
the
attachment
this
scoundrel
had
shown
for
him
aroused
something
that
almost
resembled
emotion
it
is
no
use
my
friend
he
replied
what
is
done
ca
be
undone
but
i
give
you
this
evening
at
all
events
you
find
me
waiting
for
you
in
the
aurora
as
usual
at
this
season
of
the
year
there
were
a
great
many
vessels
in
the
harbour
and
the
aurora
tavern
was
full
that
evening
of
seafaring
folk
laughing
and
talking
and
singing
and
renewing
or
laying
the
foundations
of
acquaintanceships
over
brandy
or
gin
while
in
the
little
room
over
the
bar
dance
music
was
going
on
uninterruptedly
and
the
boards
were
creaking
under
alternate
dutch
schottische
and
english
hornpipe
to
properly
appreciate
a
genuine
sailors
reel
or
hornpipe
one
should
see
it
danced
by
men
who
for
a
whole
year
at
a
time
have
been
battling
with
the
waves
and
storms
in
every
corner
of
the
world
and
who
during
all
that
time
have
hardly
set
eyes
upon
a
female
form
they
come
on
shore
bursting
with
a
full
masculine
longing
for
the
society
of
the
other
sex
with
a
year
feeling
to
let
out
and
there
is
a
positive
intoxication
to
them
in
the
mere
dance
in
the
mere
holding
at
nieuwediep
anniken
or
bibecke
or
at
portsmouth
mary
ann
by
the
waist
and
mary
ann
and
bibecke
perfectly
understand
this
and
for
the
moment
feel
themselves
persons
of
no
small
importance
there
is
no
element
of
coarseness
in
the
feeling
the
sailor
is
more
given
to
sentiment
proper
than
perhaps
any
other
class
of
men
and
generally
speaking
a
more
romantic
feeling
for
woman
is
cherished
on
board
ship
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
if
we
wish
to
find
in
these
times
quietly
romantic
enthusiasm
we
must
be
the
companion
of
the
sailor
on
his
lonely
watch
or
listen
to
him
as
he
lies
on
the
forecastle
and
talks
with
simplicity
about
his
wife
or
his
sweetheart
how
their
attachment
came
about
and
what
he
means
to
buy
for
her
when
he
gets
into
port
love
on
board
ship
is
a
more
naturally
rich
and
varying
theme
than
it
is
in
the
peasant
monotonous
life
and
being
in
love
by
reason
of
separation
from
the
object
of
his
love
is
a
different
thing
to
the
sailor
a
something
more
entirely
of
the
heart
and
the
imagination
which
does
not
lose
its
ideal
hue
in
the
wear
and
tear
of
everyday
use
a
married
sailor
is
always
an
object
of
quiet
respect
to
his
comrades
who
have
not
had
means
to
take
the
same
step
themselves
and
without
exaggeration
it
may
be
said
that
woman
is
present
in
her
truest
sense
in
the
midst
of
the
often
outwardly
rough
life
on
board
ship
warm
loving
and
venerated
and
surrounded
by
all
the
enchantment
which
distance
can
supply
if
we
are
tempted
to
think
otherwise
we
have
not
penetrated
to
the
simple
childlike
nature
which
underlies
the
sailor
rough
exterior
the
exteriors
indeed
in
the
of
the
aurora
that
evening
were
rough
enough
through
the
cloud
of
steam
and
men
of
the
most
various
physiognomies
were
to
be
seen
the
majority
tanned
and
bearded
with
their
hats
on
the
back
of
their
heads
and
short
clay
pipes
in
their
mouths
and
all
in
the
wildest
state
of
enjoyment
dripping
with
perspiration
and
dancing
indefatigably
there
were
french
and
swedish
sailors
in
their
red
woollen
shirts
norwegians
and
danes
in
blue
with
white
canvas
trousers
yankees
and
english
all
in
blue
and
as
they
swung
the
gracefully
dressed
dutch
girls
with
their
small
white
caps
and
little
capes
and
petticoats
fastened
up
to
do
justice
to
the
neat
shoes
and
white
stockings
below
vying
with
each
other
who
should
dance
the
best
and
longest
the
foundation
of
many
a
friendship
or
enmity
was
laid
to
be
prosecuted
later
on
in
the
evening
over
a
bottle
of
brandy
or
in
a
fight
salvé
and
federigo
were
sitting
over
their
gin
in
a
which
opened
into
the
and
was
filled
with
men
talking
and
drinking
or
with
couples
who
came
in
to
rest
for
a
moment
neither
took
part
in
the
dancing
salvé
was
gloomy
and
out
of
tune
for
pleasure
although
for
federigo
sake
he
made
his
humour
as
little
apparent
as
possible
federigo
looked
very
disconsolate
and
during
the
early
part
of
the
evening
sat
and
sipped
his
glass
abstractedly
but
as
the
time
wore
on
he
kept
filling
salvé
glass
unconsciously
as
it
were
and
getting
apparently
more
and
more
drunk
himself
until
he
several
times
spilt
the
contents
of
his
own
glass
on
the
floor
he
became
very
talkative
recalling
incident
after
incident
of
their
life
together
i
shall
never
forget
you
he
cried
with
impulsiveness
never
and
as
he
repeated
the
word
there
was
a
gleam
of
suppressed
feeling
of
some
kind
or
other
in
his
eye
salvé
attention
was
preoccupied
at
the
moment
he
had
heard
two
voices
speaking
norwegian
by
the
window
at
his
back
and
it
made
his
heart
knock
against
his
ribs
it
was
so
long
since
he
had
heard
his
they
were
two
men
belonging
to
timber
ships
and
one
of
them
very
red
and
excited
was
singing
the
praises
of
one
of
the
girls
in
the
other
room
ah
broke
in
the
other
a
tonsberger
you
should
have
seen
handsome
elizabeth
in
star
at
amsterdam
but
she
was
for
such
as
you
to
dance
with
my
lad
salvé
interest
was
awakened
at
once
he
listened
with
strained
attention
for
what
might
come
next
and
why
not
asked
the
other
a
little
on
his
dignity
well
in
the
first
place
they
do
dance
there
and
in
the
next
you
would
want
to
be
a
skipper
at
least
to
pay
court
in
that
quarter
mind
you
i
saw
her
in
the
spring
of
last
year
when
we
were
lying
there
with
the
galatea
she
was
talking
to
the
captain
for
she
norwegian
and
a
proud
one
she
is
too
with
hair
like
a
crown
of
gold
on
her
head
and
so
straight
rigged
that
it
makes
a
man
nervous
to
come
alongside
her
salvé
sat
rapt
in
thought
and
more
absent
than
was
polite
to
his
friend
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
an
idea
that
it
might
be
elizabeth
had
shot
through
him
and
he
could
not
divest
himself
of
it
although
the
more
he
reflected
the
more
certain
he
knew
he
ought
to
be
that
she
had
been
married
long
ago
to
young
beck
his
mind
was
in
a
ferment
and
a
wild
longing
now
possessed
him
to
get
home
to
arendal
and
find
out
for
certain
how
matters
actually
stood
when
the
time
came
for
breaking
up
federigo
was
drunk
and
salvé
was
obliged
to
accompany
his
inconsolable
friend
in
the
darkness
over
the
long
narrow
dam
down
by
the
dock
where
there
was
water
on
both
sides
federigo
clinging
to
his
arm
the
whole
way
and
leaning
heavily
upon
it
when
they
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
dam
salvé
saw
him
make
a
sudden
movement
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
he
received
a
thrust
in
the
region
of
the
heart
of
such
force
that
he
staggered
two
or
three
steps
backwards
at
the
same
time
he
heard
federigo
say
in
a
voice
trembling
with
vindictive
passion
take
that
for
paolina
you
hound
the
object
of
his
cupidity
the
belt
of
money
had
saved
salvé
who
now
felled
him
to
the
ground
with
a
blow
that
sent
him
rolling
over
the
embankment
into
the
sea
help
help
came
up
to
him
from
the
water
you
shall
have
it
replied
salvé
derisively
for
our
fine
friendship
sake
throw
up
your
knife
though
first
and
he
made
a
noose
in
his
handkerchief
then
to
reach
down
to
him
you
and
your
owl
of
a
sister
he
muttered
as
he
did
so
have
taught
me
a
thing
or
two
i
should
only
have
had
exactly
what
i
deserved
if
i
had
been
both
stuck
and
plundered
after
being
fool
enough
to
put
faith
for
one
moment
in
you
or
any
one
else
now
up
with
you
when
he
saw
federigo
form
scrambling
up
over
the
edge
he
said
scornfully
now
then
at
last
we
part
my
old
and
faithful
friend
with
that
he
went
his
way
and
heard
the
brazilian
screaming
and
stamping
with
rage
down
on
the
dam
behind
him
in
the
dark
chapter
xviii
an
opportunity
offered
almost
immediately
for
taking
a
passage
home
with
the
tonsberger
before
alluded
to
and
salvé
gladly
availed
himself
of
it
calculating
upon
being
taken
off
by
one
of
the
pilot
boats
off
the
coast
of
arendal
it
was
with
a
strange
deep
feeling
that
he
once
more
trod
the
deck
of
a
home
vessel
and
as
he
went
about
and
listened
to
the
people
talk
felt
himself
an
object
for
their
curiosity
the
southern
brown
of
his
face
the
foreign
cut
of
his
clothes
and
his
whole
exterior
marked
him
as
coming
from
a
much
higher
condition
of
sailor
life
than
any
with
which
they
were
acquainted
and
he
passed
for
an
englishman
or
an
american
for
he
purposely
avoided
being
recognised
by
them
as
a
countryman
and
had
made
his
agreement
with
the
skipper
in
english
it
was
certainly
a
long
time
since
he
had
been
on
board
a
craft
so
miserably
found
in
every
way
as
this
leaky
old
galliot
was
she
had
been
bought
by
auction
for
a
small
sum
at
færder
and
in
shape
resembled
an
old
wooden
shoe
in
which
her
skipper
venturesomely
trudged
across
to
holland
through
the
spring
and
winter
storms
calculating
that
he
and
his
crew
could
always
lash
themselves
to
something
to
avoid
being
washed
overboard
that
their
timber
cargo
would
keep
them
afloat
and
that
as
long
as
the
rigging
held
they
could
sail
he
carried
no
so
as
not
to
strain
her
her
sails
were
all
in
holes
as
if
they
had
been
riddled
with
bullets
and
where
ropes
had
broken
in
the
rigging
they
had
been
tied
in
clumsy
knots
instead
of
being
spliced
in
proper
fashion
there
was
not
much
to
boast
of
in
the
way
of
navigation
either
the
captain
keeping
his
log
by
the
simple
method
of
spitting
over
the
side
or
throwing
a
chip
of
wood
overboard
and
making
his
calculations
according
to
the
pace
it
drifted
past
the
food
too
was
on
a
par
with
all
the
rest
and
the
cook
could
be
heard
beating
the
dried
fish
with
the
back
of
an
axe
to
make
it
tender
salvé
seemed
to
have
dropped
all
at
once
into
home
life
and
ways
again
the
crew
were
dressed
in
thick
winter
clothing
and
had
the
appearance
of
navvies
rather
than
of
sailors
but
they
were
all
fearless
fellows
as
most
of
the
men
who
risk
their
lives
on
these
timber
vessels
are
and
what
immediately
struck
him
with
a
feeling
of
pleasure
was
the
honest
expression
which
every
countenance
without
exception
wore
it
was
long
since
he
had
seen
a
sight
of
the
kind
and
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
for
going
about
with
his
knife
ready
to
hand
as
had
been
his
custom
for
so
many
years
and
put
it
away
in
his
chest
the
very
first
day
he
took
a
pleasure
in
leaving
his
watch
and
money
out
on
the
top
where
they
might
easily
have
been
taken
and
was
filled
with
surprise
and
admiration
when
he
found
that
they
were
not
stirred
he
had
not
been
able
to
get
out
of
his
head
the
idea
that
elizabeth
was
now
in
amsterdam
in
spite
of
the
almost
certain
feeling
which
he
had
that
she
had
been
long
ago
married
to
young
beck
his
thoughts
kept
returning
to
and
dwelling
upon
this
subject
and
he
began
to
sound
the
skipper
as
to
whether
the
trade
with
holland
was
a
paying
one
and
to
post
himself
up
generally
in
all
particulars
their
conversation
was
carried
on
in
a
kind
of
jumble
of
english
chiefly
and
he
gathered
at
all
events
that
it
was
a
lucrative
business
and
an
occupation
which
seemed
likely
to
suit
him
in
every
way
it
was
adventurous
and
that
was
a
recommendation
and
a
way
of
living
at
home
in
which
he
would
be
under
nobody
orders
but
his
own
fell
in
exactly
with
his
nature
he
had
more
than
money
enough
to
purchase
some
old
craft
or
other
and
in
fact
it
was
decided
he
would
be
the
owner
of
a
timber
ship
and
ply
to
holland
he
began
now
to
look
out
more
impatiently
than
ever
for
land
and
longed
so
to
catch
the
first
streak
of
the
norwegian
coast
above
the
horizon
as
if
it
was
something
he
hardly
dared
hope
that
he
should
live
to
see
he
paced
up
and
down
for
hours
together
anathematising
through
his
teeth
the
old
tub
with
her
slack
sails
and
rolling
motion
they
seemed
to
be
drifting
not
sailing
and
from
the
restlessness
and
impatience
he
exhibited
it
began
to
be
whispered
among
the
crew
that
the
englishman
must
have
a
screw
loose
somewhere
when
the
dim
outline
of
lindesnaes
became
discernible
at
last
in
the
far
distance
there
was
not
a
promontory
in
all
the
southern
seas
that
could
compare
with
it
he
thought
and
the
pleasure
he
experienced
was
only
dashed
by
the
apprehension
of
what
he
might
have
to
learn
about
elizabeth
on
landing
they
were
hailed
shortly
after
by
a
pilot
boat
from
arendal
and
he
arrived
there
after
dark
the
same
evening
and
went
to
madam
unpretending
until
the
morning
the
following
day
was
sunday
and
as
he
listened
to
the
bells
ringing
and
watched
the
townspeople
great
and
small
going
decorously
up
the
street
in
their
best
clothes
to
church
most
of
them
he
recognised
and
among
them
elizabeth
old
aunt
going
up
by
herself
with
her
and
her
white
folded
handkerchief
in
her
hand
an
indescribable
feeling
came
over
him
and
his
eyes
filled
so
that
he
could
hardly
see
here
passing
before
him
were
all
the
gentleness
and
the
purity
that
he
had
once
believed
in
when
his
young
faith
had
as
yet
received
no
shock
and
when
he
was
as
joyous
and
credulous
as
the
rest
and
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
joining
the
stream
trusting
to
the
alteration
in
his
appearance
to
save
him
from
recognition
beside
him
almost
there
walked
a
respectable
family
he
knew
well
who
they
were
with
a
couple
of
handsome
daughters
in
light
dresses
who
had
grown
up
since
he
last
saw
them
and
a
younger
brother
whom
he
did
not
remember
the
foreign
sailor
with
his
fine
cloth
clothes
and
his
patent
gold
seemed
to
excite
their
curiosity
while
he
on
his
side
was
thinking
how
they
would
fly
from
him
as
if
a
wolf
had
suddenly
appeared
in
their
midst
if
they
had
any
conception
of
the
life
that
he
had
been
leading
for
years
of
which
would
have
filled
them
with
more
horror
than
they
had
ever
imagined
they
would
not
understand
it
if
it
was
described
to
them
and
the
description
would
be
too
foul
for
their
ears
as
he
quietly
followed
the
stream
up
the
hill
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
sunny
houses
in
his
beautiful
native
town
were
crying
out
against
him
and
asking
whether
it
was
possible
that
a
man
from
the
stars
and
stripes
could
be
permitted
to
go
to
church
as
well
as
other
people
and
on
entering
the
building
he
had
to
summon
up
all
his
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
was
violating
the
sanctity
of
the
place
he
took
his
seat
in
the
last
pew
close
to
the
door
and
watched
the
people
passing
up
the
aisle
it
was
like
a
dream
they
all
seemed
creatures
of
a
purer
world
than
his
the
organ
commenced
to
play
the
singing
was
begun
and
he
leaned
his
head
forward
on
his
hands
completely
overcome
and
trying
to
conceal
his
sobs
in
this
position
he
remained
during
the
greater
part
of
the
service
his
past
life
coming
up
scene
by
scene
before
him
what
a
gulf
he
felt
there
was
between
the
present
condition
of
his
mind
and
what
it
had
been
in
the
days
when
as
a
boy
or
lad
he
had
gone
to
church
like
the
rest
he
had
been
familiar
with
more
murder
and
blasphemy
than
the
whole
congregation
together
could
conceive
and
the
simple
faith
he
had
once
possessed
he
had
been
robbed
of
he
feared
irrecoverably
his
eyes
flashed
then
with
a
sudden
wildness
as
he
thought
who
it
was
that
had
brought
him
to
this
and
it
was
with
a
deep
hatred
in
his
heart
to
one
of
the
two
at
least
that
he
left
the
church
in
a
couple
who
were
coming
out
at
the
same
time
he
recognised
captain
beck
and
his
wife
and
the
sight
added
fuel
to
the
flames
he
hastened
on
and
was
hardly
to
be
recognised
as
the
same
man
who
had
gone
up
the
same
way
so
quietly
two
hours
before
he
had
meant
to
go
over
at
once
to
sandvigen
to
see
his
father
but
he
thought
that
before
going
it
would
be
as
well
to
find
out
for
certain
all
about
elizabeth
and
his
landlady
seemed
as
likely
a
person
to
be
able
to
satisfy
him
as
any
one
he
remembered
well
that
sharp
little
woman
and
knew
that
she
was
a
regular
magpie
for
chatter
and
for
repeating
the
gossip
of
the
town
at
that
time
of
the
day
on
sunday
there
were
no
other
customers
in
the
house
and
while
she
was
busying
herself
with
preparations
for
his
dinner
he
asked
casually
if
captain
beck
son
the
one
in
the
navy
was
married
to
be
sure
he
is
she
replied
surprised
to
hear
him
speak
norwegian
he
has
been
married
for
let
me
see
about
three
years
she
looked
fixedly
at
him
but
who
are
you
she
asked
and
then
as
if
the
thought
had
suddenly
flashed
upon
her
she
said
it
never
salvé
kristiansen
who
she
stopped
here
and
salvé
dryly
finished
the
sentence
for
her
who
deserted
from
beck
at
rio
the
same
madam
gjers
was
agog
with
curiosity
and
whispered
i
say
nothing
you
may
trust
me
and
waited
eagerly
then
for
further
particulars
which
she
might
take
the
first
opportunity
of
retailing
salvé
assured
her
that
he
knew
of
old
that
a
secret
was
always
safe
with
her
and
resumed
then
absently
so
the
lieutenant
is
married
this
long
while
she
replied
the
wedding
was
at
the
house
of
the
bride
parents
and
they
are
living
now
at
frederiksværn
elizabeth
had
no
parents
said
salvé
rather
impatiently
elizabeth
oh
you
mean
the
girl
the
becks
took
to
live
with
them
that
is
quite
another
story
she
said
significantly
no
the
lieutenant
wife
was
postmaster
forstberg
daughter
the
other
was
just
a
passing
fancy
the
end
of
it
was
that
she
had
to
go
to
holland
poor
thing
it
was
said
she
had
got
a
place
there
do
you
know
anything
for
certain
of
this
asked
salvé
severely
and
with
an
earnestness
that
put
the
little
madam
out
of
countenance
and
made
her
be
careful
of
her
words
it
was
all
done
very
secretly
that
true
she
replied
but
she
went
away
in
the
greatest
possible
hurry
and
the
affair
was
well
enough
known
more
the
pity
known
and
forgotten
now
one
may
say
what
was
known
asked
salvé
catching
her
up
angrily
did
you
see
her
madam
gjers
not
i
indeed
nor
no
one
else
neither
the
becks
were
living
out
at
tromö
at
the
time
and
there
was
just
very
good
reason
for
then
neither
you
nor
any
one
else
who
wants
to
take
away
her
character
know
a
jot
more
about
the
business
than
what
you
have
chosen
to
invent
said
salvé
fiercely
and
contemptuously
for
although
he
had
slain
elizabeth
himself
in
his
heart
he
must
still
defend
her
against
the
attacks
of
others
he
felt
quite
sick
and
faint
i
happen
to
know
the
rights
of
the
case
he
said
with
a
short
laugh
looking
her
coldly
and
sharply
in
the
face
and
he
sprang
up
suddenly
here
and
striking
the
table
violently
with
his
fist
and
i
do
taste
another
morsel
in
such
a
house
he
cried
do
you
understand
madam
be
good
enough
to
take
what
is
owing
to
you
out
of
that
and
flinging
down
a
handful
of
silver
on
to
the
table
he
sprang
over
it
and
proceeded
to
drag
his
chest
himself
madam
gjers
exhausted
herself
in
a
flood
of
deprecation
the
gist
of
which
was
that
she
had
only
said
and
believed
what
she
had
heard
from
every
creature
in
the
town
but
salvé
was
unappeasable
and
slinging
his
chest
over
his
back
with
a
rope
he
went
down
with
it
to
the
quay
with
the
intention
of
chartering
a
boat
to
take
him
over
to
his
father
for
the
present
however
he
remained
sitting
upon
the
chest
gazing
out
abstractedly
over
the
harbour
the
result
of
his
reflections
was
that
he
gave
up
his
idea
of
plying
to
holland
he
took
a
boat
to
sandvigen
but
while
they
were
on
the
way
he
suddenly
made
the
boatman
change
his
course
and
put
in
to
the
slip
on
the
other
side
of
the
harbour
he
must
talk
to
elizabeth
aunt
there
was
something
in
his
mind
all
the
time
that
would
let
him
altogether
believe
the
worst
when
he
went
in
to
the
old
woman
she
recognised
him
at
once
how
do
you
do
salvé
she
said
quite
calmly
you
have
been
a
long
while
away
half
a
century
almost
she
offered
him
a
chair
but
he
remained
standing
and
asked
abruptly
is
it
true
that
elizabeth
left
beck
like
that
and
went
to
holland
how
do
you
mean
like
that
she
asked
sharply
while
her
face
flushed
slightly
as
people
say
replied
salvé
with
bitter
emphasis
when
people
say
it
a
fool
like
you
of
course
must
believe
it
she
rejoined
derisively
i
do
understand
why
you
want
to
come
here
to
her
old
aunt
for
information
when
it
seems
you
have
so
many
other
confidants
about
the
town
but
anyhow
she
can
tell
you
something
different
from
them
my
lad
and
she
would
do
it
if
it
was
that
she
knew
the
girl
still
loved
you
in
spite
of
all
the
years
you
have
been
away
gadding
about
god
knows
where
in
the
world
it
true
enough
she
left
beck
one
night
and
came
here
in
the
morning
but
it
was
just
for
your
sake
and
no
one
else
that
she
might
get
quit
of
the
lieutenant
it
was
madam
beck
herself
that
got
her
a
place
in
holland
because
she
did
want
to
have
her
for
a
a
wild
gleam
of
joy
broke
over
salvé
features
for
a
moment
but
they
relapsed
almost
immediately
into
gloom
was
she
not
engaged
to
carl
beck
then
he
asked
yes
and
no
replied
the
old
woman
cautiously
not
wishing
to
depart
a
from
the
truth
she
allowed
herself
to
be
betrayed
into
saying
but
fled
from
the
house
because
she
did
want
to
have
him
she
told
me
with
tears
in
her
eyes
that
she
repented
having
said
to
you
so
that
was
the
way
of
it
he
rejoined
sarcastically
the
and
meant
that
the
becks
would
have
her
for
a
and
bundled
her
out
of
the
house
over
to
holland
and
you
want
me
to
believe
it
was
for
my
sake
she
went
god
knows
he
added
sadly
and
shaking
his
head
slowly
i
would
willingly
believe
it
more
willingly
than
i
can
say
but
i
ca
mother
kirstine
you
are
her
aunt
and
want
of
course
to
i
afraid
it
is
your
misfortune
salvé
she
broke
in
severely
not
to
have
it
in
your
power
to
believe
thoroughly
in
any
one
creature
upon
this
earth
you
be
always
doubting
always
listening
to
folks
talk
with
the
thoughts
you
have
now
in
your
mind
you
have
at
any
rate
no
business
any
longer
inside
my
door
but
there
is
one
thing
i
ask
of
you
she
said
with
a
look
of
mildly
impressive
earnestness
in
her
strong
clever
face
i
know
elizabeth
nature
well
and
do
you
attempt
to
approach
her
or
try
to
win
her
as
long
as
you
have
a
trace
of
those
doubts
about
her
in
your
heart
it
would
only
bring
unhappiness
to
both
of
you
he
looked
dejected
and
as
he
said
to
her
offered
to
take
her
hand
but
she
would
not
give
it
to
him
and
merely
added
instead
remember
that
it
is
an
old
woman
who
has
seen
a
good
deal
in
the
world
who
tells
you
this
he
went
away
then
and
while
he
was
being
rowed
across
to
sandvigen
he
changed
his
mind
again
and
determined
that
his
plan
of
plying
to
holland
should
be
carried
out
chapter
xix
skipper
garvloit
into
whose
family
elizabeth
had
come
occupied
one
of
the
houses
with
green
narrow
and
polished
brass
knockers
after
the
usual
dutch
fashion
in
the
lively
street
leading
down
to
the
dock
in
amsterdam
with
the
canal
on
the
other
side
with
its
various
bridges
and
vessels
and
barges
of
all
kinds
unlading
running
up
from
it
into
the
heart
of
the
town
madam
garvloit
had
four
young
children
and
was
not
very
strong
so
that
elizabeth
robust
healthy
nature
had
been
a
perfect
godsend
to
her
in
the
house
and
she
was
content
to
overlook
her
occasional
shortcomings
of
manner
or
temper
in
consideration
of
the
assistance
which
she
rendered
in
every
department
of
the
housekeeping
elizabeth
had
always
had
a
pretty
strong
will
of
her
own
and
here
where
she
virtually
had
the
control
of
everything
her
tendency
to
had
been
considerably
developed
the
force
and
decision
with
which
she
gave
her
opinion
about
everything
seemed
to
madam
garvloit
sometimes
although
she
said
nothing
rather
like
a
reversing
of
their
relative
positions
and
on
days
when
she
was
in
a
captious
humour
and
those
were
her
days
of
most
feverish
activity
she
would
even
go
so
far
as
to
set
aside
her
mistress
orders
altogether
in
a
general
way
her
moods
were
very
uncertain
one
day
she
would
be
in
tearing
spirits
racing
up
and
down
the
stairs
with
the
children
as
if
she
had
been
inhaling
the
wild
air
of
torungen
again
and
another
she
would
be
so
pensive
and
taciturn
that
they
thought
she
must
be
pining
after
home
she
had
many
admirers
both
among
young
and
old
her
gay
moods
attracting
the
former
and
her
serious
ones
the
latter
among
the
former
were
two
young
gentlemen
acquaintances
of
the
house
relatives
of
garvloit
one
a
smart
young
clerk
from
one
of
the
larger
in
the
town
who
rather
affected
the
gentleman
and
the
other
a
skipper
son
from
vlieland
they
both
came
regularly
every
sunday
were
frantically
jealous
of
one
another
tried
to
outbid
each
other
whenever
an
opportunity
offered
and
were
both
fully
convinced
that
they
sighed
in
vain
she
was
so
different
they
felt
from
the
other
specimens
of
femininity
of
their
acquaintance
to
whom
their
weak
attentions
had
sometimes
proved
acceptable
there
was
something
almost
imperious
in
elizabeth
manner
at
times
that
made
them
feel
quite
small
beside
her
and
however
careless
she
might
be
of
the
in
her
way
of
speaking
to
them
they
had
very
soon
found
that
wherever
she
chose
to
draw
the
line
so
far
could
they
go
and
no
farther
madame
garvloit
would
take
her
to
task
sometimes
for
the
scant
courtesy
with
which
she
treated
the
young
clerk
elizabeth
would
answer
that
he
bored
her
and
madame
garvloit
would
insist
that
a
young
girl
ought
to
have
tact
enough
not
to
make
this
evident
elizabeth
however
was
not
deficient
in
tact
but
disliked
putting
a
restraint
upon
her
feelings
and
it
seemed
to
her
on
the
whole
unreasonable
that
a
person
should
pretend
that
a
thing
was
pleasant
when
in
reality
it
was
wearisome
during
the
second
autumn
of
her
service
with
the
garvloits
the
skipper
on
his
return
from
a
trip
to
norway
brought
the
intelligence
that
lieutenant
beck
was
engaged
to
postmaster
forstberg
daughter
in
arendal
and
he
had
many
messages
for
elizabeth
from
the
latter
they
were
to
be
married
in
the
spring
elizabeth
was
overjoyed
to
hear
it
for
the
thought
had
often
weighed
heavily
on
her
mind
that
carl
beck
might
be
making
himself
miserable
on
her
account
she
judged
so
from
her
own
feeling
for
salvé
and
as
she
sat
alone
by
her
window
at
bedtime
that
night
gazing
out
over
the
canal
and
the
shipping
in
the
calm
moonlight
the
quiet
afterglow
of
a
holiday
evening
seemed
to
have
shed
itself
over
her
thoughts
she
knew
from
her
friend
message
that
she
was
ignorant
of
what
had
passed
between
herself
and
carl
beck
and
although
it
was
a
relief
to
think
that
he
had
not
taken
his
disappointment
more
to
heart
the
smile
that
played
about
her
lips
for
a
moment
showed
at
the
same
time
that
his
love
had
been
duly
appraised
as
the
shadow
then
of
the
in
the
moonlight
crept
slowly
over
the
wall
above
her
bed
her
thoughts
glided
off
in
the
direction
they
loved
best
to
take
over
the
world
and
far
away
to
salvé
she
sat
with
her
heavy
hair
falling
loose
over
her
shoulders
and
her
face
grew
more
and
more
sorrowful
in
its
absent
expression
and
would
twitch
occasionally
with
pain
the
bitter
thought
would
recur
that
it
was
she
who
was
the
cause
of
salvé
going
out
into
the
world
and
becoming
a
desperate
man
the
thought
haunted
her
and
yet
much
as
she
wished
to
free
herself
from
it
she
found
a
pleasure
in
dwelling
on
it
she
saw
him
in
fancy
miserable
and
proud
with
his
pale
face
and
keen
clever
eyes
fixed
upon
her
in
hatred
as
the
cause
of
his
unhappiness
and
then
the
idea
occurred
to
her
to
put
on
clothes
and
go
and
seek
him
out
in
the
world
but
if
she
were
to
find
him
she
knew
on
the
other
hand
that
for
very
shame
she
dared
not
show
herself
before
him
having
as
good
as
belonged
to
another
and
she
would
not
for
all
the
world
read
her
hard
dismissal
in
his
eye
she
laid
her
head
upon
her
arms
on
the
and
sobbed
convulsively
until
at
length
she
dropped
off
to
sleep
where
she
sat
she
had
been
three
years
in
the
garvloits
house
when
garvloit
had
the
misfortune
to
run
his
vessel
aground
out
near
amland
where
she
became
a
wreck
he
lost
with
her
nearly
all
he
had
in
the
world
and
what
was
worse
all
prospect
of
livelihood
for
the
future
as
skipper
an
uncomfortable
feeling
prevailed
now
in
the
house
and
elizabeth
saw
with
regret
that
she
would
have
to
leave
garvloit
who
in
figure
resembled
some
thick
animal
of
the
sea
a
seal
or
walrus
come
on
land
had
become
perceptibly
reduced
in
flesh
and
went
about
all
day
long
in
his
shirtsleeves
fanning
himself
with
a
large
silk
on
one
particular
afternoon
it
was
observed
that
he
indulged
in
this
exercise
with
more
than
his
usual
vigour
and
restlessness
and
it
was
not
without
cause
he
had
had
an
inspiration
if
he
could
no
longer
follow
his
old
trade
he
would
try
a
new
one
he
would
set
up
a
house
of
entertainment
for
sailors
his
house
being
so
close
to
the
dock
could
not
be
more
favourably
situated
for
the
purpose
and
they
had
ample
accommodation
on
the
ground
floor
they
could
have
a
room
for
common
sailors
and
on
the
floor
above
they
had
one
where
captains
and
mates
could
be
served
he
said
nothing
about
it
however
to
any
one
until
the
scheme
had
been
fully
matured
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
one
day
he
came
into
the
room
where
his
wife
was
with
a
bundle
of
printed
placards
and
a
large
board
in
his
hand
good
gracious
garvloit
what
is
that
she
cried
he
turned
the
board
round
with
an
important
air
and
without
saying
a
word
upon
it
there
stood
in
large
gilt
letters
the
star
this
is
our
new
means
of
earning
our
bread
wife
he
said
next
month
this
sign
hangs
over
our
door
and
these
bills
are
to
post
on
the
walls
and
distribute
among
the
ships
down
in
the
harbour
garvloit
is
not
on
his
yet
he
concluded
with
satisfaction
and
proceeded
then
to
explain
how
he
intended
to
be
landlord
himself
and
how
elizabeth
was
to
help
him
in
the
management
of
the
whole
madam
garvloit
only
made
one
slight
objection
you
know
that
you
ca
drink
ale
my
friend
another
objection
namely
what
they
would
say
at
home
in
norway
when
they
heard
that
her
husband
had
sunk
into
a
mere
she
very
wisely
kept
to
herself
the
important
point
was
that
they
should
find
a
way
of
living
and
they
had
at
all
events
the
great
consolation
that
now
they
would
be
able
to
keep
elizabeth
what
feeling
of
pride
still
remained
she
got
rid
of
in
telling
elizabeth
that
at
home
they
knew
nothing
of
millionaires
in
wooden
shoes
such
as
were
to
be
found
in
holland
and
her
husband
found
her
much
more
keen
for
his
project
than
he
had
expected
being
accustomed
to
place
great
reliance
upon
her
stronger
understanding
he
would
not
have
been
happy
if
she
had
been
against
the
plan
thus
it
came
about
then
that
in
the
crowded
street
by
the
canal
one
monday
morning
there
appeared
over
one
of
the
a
with
the
star
in
letters
of
gold
on
a
blue
ground
it
was
set
up
at
a
fortunate
time
and
in
a
fortunate
place
and
almost
as
soon
as
the
house
was
opened
customers
from
the
vessels
in
the
harbour
began
to
gather
in
both
into
the
and
rooms
so
that
there
was
a
prospect
of
a
steadily
increasing
traffic
garvloit
generally
presided
himself
in
the
bar
behind
the
counter
at
the
lower
end
of
which
there
stood
an
array
of
stone
mugs
with
tin
lids
while
in
a
recess
of
the
wall
there
stuck
out
from
beside
canisters
of
tobacco
long
and
short
dutch
clay
pipes
a
new
one
filled
being
handed
to
every
customer
with
whatever
drink
he
ordered
out
of
sight
under
the
counter
where
the
stone
mugs
stood
was
the
with
its
bright
tap
over
a
vessel
that
caught
the
drip
and
after
the
same
cleanly
dutch
fashion
spittoons
filled
with
sand
stood
in
every
corner
of
the
room
the
shelves
above
were
filled
in
rows
with
a
regular
apothecary
shop
of
bottles
and
jars
of
spirits
and
among
them
a
goodly
array
of
flasks
of
dutch
hollands
elizabeth
had
as
housekeeper
quite
as
much
as
she
could
do
and
did
not
directly
busy
herself
with
waiting
unless
there
was
something
particular
required
to
be
done
for
the
customers
occasionally
however
she
would
come
into
the
bar
also
on
some
errand
or
another
or
to
make
sure
that
nothing
was
wanted
and
the
fame
of
handsome
elizabeth
of
the
star
contributed
not
a
little
to
bring
custom
to
the
house
such
norwegians
as
came
to
amsterdam
with
timber
the
majority
unloaded
their
cargoes
up
at
pürmurende
or
alkmar
invariably
patronised
the
star
elizabeth
used
to
talk
to
them
as
countrymen
of
her
own
and
if
she
heard
that
any
of
them
had
been
across
the
atlantic
she
would
quietly
and
as
if
quite
casually
ask
if
perchance
they
had
come
across
or
had
heard
anything
of
a
sailor
of
her
acquaintance
called
salvé
kristiansen
who
hailed
from
arendal
no
one
had
ever
heard
of
him
and
she
had
begun
to
fear
that
he
might
be
lost
to
her
for
ever
one
forenoon
however
when
she
had
a
great
deal
to
do
in
the
house
she
was
passing
quickly
through
the
room
and
there
sat
at
one
of
the
small
tables
with
an
untouched
mug
of
ale
before
him
a
bearded
man
in
a
blue
in
her
hurry
she
had
set
him
down
as
some
mate
or
captain
but
there
must
have
been
something
about
him
that
attracted
her
attention
for
she
turned
again
at
the
door
for
an
instant
and
looked
at
him
before
she
went
out
he
was
so
pale
and
he
had
sent
her
one
look
as
she
stood
outside
the
door
she
knew
it
was
salvé
although
she
had
always
pictured
him
to
herself
as
a
common
sailor
she
stood
there
trembling
all
over
and
fumbling
with
the
latch
of
the
door
in
the
greatest
agitation
evidently
debating
with
herself
whether
she
should
dare
go
in
again
she
pressed
upon
the
latch
in
the
certainty
that
it
would
go
up
before
she
had
actually
decided
that
she
would
go
in
and
it
did
so
the
door
opened
again
of
itself
and
elizabeth
entered
with
downcast
eyes
and
scarlet
in
the
face
and
passed
through
the
room
making
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
as
if
for
greeting
as
she
passed
him
she
had
reached
the
opposite
door
when
she
heard
a
quiet
bitter
laugh
behind
her
at
once
she
turned
with
pride
in
every
feature
of
her
face
and
looked
at
him
how
do
you
do
salvé
kristiansen
she
said
firmly
and
quietly
how
do
you
do
elizabeth
he
replied
rather
huskily
getting
up
and
looking
confused
are
you
lying
here
in
amsterdam
with
some
vessel
he
sat
down
again
for
there
was
something
in
her
manner
that
denied
approach
no
in
pürmurende
he
replied
i
only
came
in
here
to
you
are
in
the
timber
line
then
now
yes
elizabeth
he
ventured
to
add
in
another
tone
which
had
a
whole
volume
of
meaning
in
it
but
she
took
her
leave
of
him
now
in
the
same
proud
manner
and
left
the
room
salvé
sat
for
a
while
with
compressed
lips
looking
down
upon
the
table
before
him
when
she
turned
round
the
first
time
at
the
door
something
told
him
that
she
would
come
in
again
but
he
had
expected
quite
a
different
kind
of
scene
a
good
deal
of
the
tyrant
had
been
developed
in
him
since
they
had
last
met
and
when
she
had
come
in
so
quietly
and
so
humbly
with
the
acknowledgment
of
the
great
wrong
she
had
done
him
written
upon
her
face
he
felt
himself
at
once
with
a
certain
bitter
and
devouring
pleasure
upon
the
he
must
first
see
her
crushed
before
him
then
he
would
have
forgiven
her
and
loved
her
with
all
the
passion
of
his
soul
but
as
she
stood
there
by
the
door
looking
so
grand
in
her
pride
and
so
pale
with
repressed
mortification
and
spoke
so
calmly
he
had
felt
that
in
that
moment
he
had
been
separated
farther
from
her
than
ever
he
had
been
in
all
his
wanderings
at
the
other
side
of
the
globe
he
sat
there
with
his
mind
in
a
chaotic
state
of
desperation
and
sorrow
and
of
anger
with
himself
what
a
grand
creature
she
was
and
he
how
pitiful
and
petty
he
set
down
the
mug
which
he
had
been
absently
toying
with
hard
on
the
table
and
went
out
for
a
long
while
he
wandered
about
the
quays
in
a
state
of
gloomy
indecision
stopping
every
now
and
then
to
run
his
eye
over
the
shipping
and
his
expression
becoming
darker
still
every
time
he
did
so
from
long
practice
he
could
tell
by
the
appearance
of
every
vessel
what
trade
it
was
engaged
in
one
was
a
coffee
ship
from
java
the
next
carried
general
cargo
to
all
parts
of
the
world
there
was
another
that
brought
sugar
and
rum
from
the
west
indies
and
a
fourth
that
from
its
square
build
and
breadth
of
beam
must
be
a
whaler
returned
from
spitzbergen
he
thought
of
their
long
voyages
and
of
the
life
without
root
or
tie
that
was
passed
on
board
them
was
he
to
go
back
to
that
life
again
it
depended
on
elizabeth
and
he
had
not
much
hope
to
his
impatient
nature
delay
was
intolerable
and
he
had
half
made
up
his
mind
to
have
his
fate
decided
at
once
in
spite
of
his
agitation
however
he
could
still
think
with
coolness
and
he
knew
that
if
he
was
to
have
any
chance
at
all
he
must
wait
until
the
first
unfortunate
impression
had
had
time
to
pass
off
it
had
been
a
grey
foggy
autumn
day
but
was
now
clearing
and
blue
patches
of
sky
were
coming
out
and
as
he
crossed
the
bridge
the
afternoon
sun
shone
out
and
sent
a
ray
of
glittering
light
against
the
of
the
street
along
the
canal
up
in
garvloit
house
elizabeth
was
standing
at
the
open
window
she
too
that
day
had
needed
to
be
alone
with
her
thoughts
salvé
saw
her
and
stood
still
for
a
moment
contemplating
her
as
she
leant
out
over
the
window
ledge
that
dear
head
shall
be
mine
he
burst
out
then
passionately
and
without
knowing
it
aloud
and
the
next
moment
he
was
at
door
elizabeth
heard
the
door
of
the
room
open
behind
her
and
when
she
saw
salvé
unexpectedly
standing
before
her
she
sank
down
for
a
moment
on
to
a
chair
but
got
up
the
next
with
a
scared
look
almost
as
if
he
was
some
hostile
apparition
elizabeth
he
said
gently
are
you
going
to
send
me
out
again
into
the
world
god
only
knows
how
i
shall
come
back
if
you
do
she
did
not
answer
but
stood
looking
at
him
with
a
rigid
expression
and
pale
as
death
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
to
breathe
and
to
be
only
waiting
for
him
to
say
more
be
my
wife
elizabeth
he
asked
and
i
shall
grow
up
into
a
good
man
again
what
a
pitiful
creature
i
have
been
without
you
you
have
already
seen
sufficiently
this
morning
god
be
my
witness
salvé
she
answered
the
tears
bursting
into
her
eyes
with
emotion
which
she
tried
to
control
you
alone
have
always
had
my
heart
but
i
must
first
know
in
perfect
truth
what
you
think
of
me
the
same
as
i
think
of
god
angels
elizabeth
he
said
from
his
heart
and
tried
to
take
her
hand
do
you
know
that
i
was
once
very
nearly
engaged
to
young
beck
she
asked
reddening
but
with
a
steady
look
i
did
know
my
real
self
then
but
was
thinking
only
of
folly
and
nonsense
until
i
was
obliged
to
fly
from
it
all
your
aunt
has
told
me
all
about
it
elizabeth
do
let
us
mention
the
subject
again
and
you
have
a
doubt
about
me
in
your
heart
for
that
i
never
will
bear
salvé
like
i
ca
bear
it
do
you
understand
she
said
with
a
shake
in
her
voice
and
looking
as
it
were
down
into
his
very
soul
doubt
he
said
and
for
that
moment
at
all
events
he
was
evidently
convinced
that
she
had
never
given
her
real
heart
to
any
one
but
himself
a
look
of
inexpressible
happiness
came
into
her
face
he
caught
her
into
his
arms
and
they
stood
as
if
they
never
would
let
go
of
each
other
again
cheek
to
cheek
not
speaking
not
thinking
even
there
was
something
convulsive
in
their
embrace
as
if
they
could
not
believe
in
the
reality
of
their
happiness
and
as
if
they
felt
an
instinctive
dread
that
they
should
lose
it
again
unobserved
by
either
of
them
the
door
had
opened
and
in
the
doorway
stood
pursy
garvloit
gazing
in
helpless
bewilderment
at
the
scene
before
him
at
last
elizabeth
caught
sight
of
him
and
not
with
any
confusion
but
only
eager
to
communicate
her
happiness
exclaimed
it
is
my
lover
your
lover
and
he
fell
back
a
step
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
my
name
is
salvé
kristiansen
master
of
the
apollo
added
salvé
without
letting
her
go
and
feeling
everything
around
him
infinitely
small
at
that
moment
garvloit
turned
round
and
shouted
several
times
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
raising
his
voice
at
each
repetition
andrea
andrea
to
his
wife
and
as
she
did
not
come
immediately
he
stumbled
as
fast
as
his
corpulence
would
allow
him
down
the
stairs
pausing
however
with
a
vacant
look
upon
the
last
step
madam
garvloit
came
out
with
her
work
in
her
hand
and
asked
what
the
matter
was
the
matter
is
replied
her
husband
dismally
that
i
am
ruined
there
is
elizabeth
up
there
sitting
with
some
skipper
god
knows
whom
who
she
says
is
her
lover
is
it
possible
go
and
see
for
yourself
and
as
his
wife
hurried
past
him
up
the
stairs
he
added
in
the
same
dismal
tone
who
shall
we
get
to
look
after
the
house
now
we
shall
never
have
another
like
her
and
he
sighed
profoundly
when
madam
garvloit
appeared
at
the
door
elizabeth
finished
her
interrupted
explanation
i
have
known
him
ever
since
i
was
a
little
girl
she
said
it
was
at
once
evident
to
her
mistress
that
there
must
be
a
romantic
story
here
but
though
brimming
over
with
curiosity
she
deferred
her
questions
until
a
more
convenient
season
in
the
meantime
she
manifested
the
most
lively
sympathy
and
after
winning
salvé
heart
by
telling
him
what
a
treasure
elizabeth
had
been
to
her
she
begged
that
as
long
as
he
remained
in
amsterdam
he
would
come
in
and
out
of
the
house
as
he
pleased
chapter
xx
when
madam
garvloit
had
made
some
excuse
next
morning
to
leave
the
two
alone
together
in
her
salvé
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
small
parcel
and
opening
it
deliberately
said
with
a
certain
solemnity
five
years
ago
elizabeth
when
i
was
in
boston
i
bought
these
rings
he
took
them
out
of
the
paper
and
laid
them
in
her
hand
i
have
had
a
good
deal
to
bear
since
but
you
see
i
have
kept
them
all
along
notwithstanding
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
hid
her
face
upon
his
breast
and
he
could
feel
that
she
was
crying
she
tried
them
on
then
both
on
the
same
finger
and
holding
up
the
hand
to
show
him
said
that
is
the
first
ring
i
ever
possessed
a
shadow
passed
across
his
face
and
it
flushed
slightly
and
she
only
then
perceived
what
connection
of
ideas
her
remark
might
have
suggested
he
had
three
days
to
spare
before
he
was
obliged
to
be
back
at
pürmurende
on
board
the
old
brig
of
which
he
was
now
master
and
with
which
patched
and
leaky
though
she
was
after
his
sailor
pride
had
been
overcome
he
had
grown
to
be
well
satisfied
enough
more
particularly
perhaps
because
she
was
his
own
the
happiness
of
these
days
was
not
marred
by
a
single
further
incident
to
remind
him
of
the
past
and
it
was
only
on
the
day
that
he
was
to
leave
that
the
foul
fiend
distrust
was
again
awakened
in
his
unlucky
heart
it
was
a
sunday
and
after
the
morning
service
there
was
to
be
a
sort
of
popular
in
amsterdam
at
the
famous
where
in
holland
great
days
when
de
ruyter
and
van
tromp
guns
were
thundering
in
the
sea
outside
the
great
merchant
princes
used
to
sit
round
the
republican
was
to
be
exhibited
that
day
for
the
first
time
the
new
picture
of
the
young
dutch
hero
van
spyck
who
blew
up
his
ship
in
the
war
of
against
belgium
salvé
and
elizabeth
joined
the
stream
and
even
caught
some
of
the
national
enthusiasm
prevailing
in
the
crowd
that
was
swaying
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
courtyard
where
a
band
was
playing
the
stirring
national
air
wien
neerlands
bloed
door
de
aders
vloeit
at
last
they
found
themselves
before
the
canvas
it
represented
the
young
cadet
of
seventeen
years
on
the
gunboat
at
the
supreme
moment
elizabeth
stood
with
her
hands
clasped
before
her
silently
engrossed
while
salvé
kept
her
from
being
pressed
upon
behind
look
she
said
turning
half
round
to
him
but
without
taking
her
eyes
off
the
picture
the
belgian
captain
is
inviting
him
to
surrender
he
has
no
choice
they
are
too
many
for
him
but
do
you
see
the
thought
he
has
in
his
mind
you
can
read
it
in
his
face
and
what
a
fine
fellow
he
looks
with
his
handsome
uniform
and
his
epaulets
and
his
short
sword
she
said
in
a
lower
tone
with
a
revival
of
her
old
childish
enthusiasm
for
that
kind
of
show
her
last
words
were
like
a
dagger
thrust
to
salvé
she
still
had
a
hankering
then
for
all
this
and
he
stood
behind
her
pale
with
suppressed
feeling
while
she
continued
to
gaze
at
the
picture
and
think
aloud
to
him
poor
handsome
lad
but
he
never
will
surrender
one
can
easily
see
that
and
so
he
must
go
down
she
said
in
a
subdued
voice
involuntarily
folding
her
hands
as
if
in
fancy
she
went
with
him
and
he
blows
up
belgian
and
all
into
the
air
salvé
she
said
turning
to
him
with
a
fine
spirited
look
in
her
face
and
with
moistened
eyes
he
made
no
reply
and
supposing
that
like
herself
he
was
lost
in
the
scene
before
them
she
turned
again
to
the
picture
but
while
after
giving
vent
to
her
feelings
she
stood
there
with
a
smile
on
her
face
thinking
that
she
knew
one
who
would
have
been
quite
as
capable
as
van
spyck
of
such
an
exploit
the
man
namely
who
was
then
standing
behind
her
to
him
the
picture
had
become
a
hateful
thing
and
he
could
have
shot
van
spyck
through
the
heart
for
his
uniform
sake
the
whole
of
the
way
home
he
was
silent
and
serious
and
it
was
not
until
late
in
the
afternoon
that
he
at
all
recovered
his
spirits
as
this
was
to
be
his
last
trip
for
the
year
the
following
spring
was
fixed
for
their
marriage
and
when
he
took
his
leave
it
was
with
the
gloomy
presentiment
that
he
had
a
dreary
winter
before
him
certainly
for
the
development
of
a
morbid
state
of
mind
no
conditions
could
have
been
more
favourable
than
the
enforced
inactivity
to
which
with
many
another
he
was
condemned
for
the
long
dark
months
during
which
the
ice
put
a
stop
to
navigation
to
his
restless
energetic
nature
such
prolonged
inaction
was
little
suited
under
any
circumstances
and
in
his
present
condition
of
mind
it
was
little
less
than
disastrous
if
she
was
only
here
he
would
sometimes
inwardly
exclaim
as
if
crying
out
for
help
against
himself
and
the
thoughts
which
he
felt
to
be
unworthy
but
which
nevertheless
he
could
not
shake
off
he
often
thought
of
writing
to
her
but
was
so
afraid
of
saying
something
which
he
might
afterwards
regret
that
he
kept
putting
it
off
from
time
to
time
until
at
last
he
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
his
letter
ran
as
follows
to
much
esteemed
miss
elizabeth
raklev
as
concerning
the
apollo
she
lies
in
a
row
of
other
ships
up
in
selvig
sound
and
the
ice
is
about
a
foot
thick
and
will
be
late
in
breaking
up
this
year
they
all
prophesy
she
is
well
looked
after
and
has
a
watchman
on
board
and
storage
room
has
been
taken
for
her
rigging
in
pettersen
but
as
touching
her
captain
to
whom
you
said
in
amsterdam
you
had
given
your
full
and
first
heart
so
firmly
that
it
could
be
moved
by
any
might
or
power
in
the
world
whatsoever
he
has
thought
much
and
often
about
this
and
would
like
to
hold
out
and
see
you
again
before
all
his
shore
cable
is
chafed
away
it
seems
as
if
it
was
holding
by
its
last
threads
and
these
through
but
if
i
could
see
you
it
would
become
so
strong
again
that
it
could
hold
against
any
stream
and
you
must
forgive
me
for
my
weakness
when
you
think
of
those
five
years
but
i
wo
say
that
it
is
your
fault
neither
make
myself
out
better
than
i
am
for
i
have
confidence
in
you
elizabeth
if
i
have
not
the
same
reliance
upon
myself
and
i
ca
help
it
if
i
have
when
you
read
this
letter
elizabeth
you
must
remember
the
poor
sailor
who
is
frozen
up
here
and
not
forget
it
afterwards
till
we
meet
again
which
i
would
give
half
my
or
more
for
if
it
was
any
use
as
i
am
consuming
away
with
impatience
up
here
i
have
such
a
longing
to
see
you
again
and
now
farewell
from
my
heart
and
god
bless
you
i
will
trust
you
and
hope
in
you
till
my
last
hour
come
what
may
farewell
my
dearest
girl
with
fond
love
from
salvé
kristiansen
this
letter
cost
elizabeth
many
a
tear
she
sat
over
it
in
the
evenings
before
she
went
to
bed
and
felt
so
poignantly
that
it
was
she
who
had
brought
him
to
this
that
he
could
not
trust
her
for
she
understood
but
too
well
what
lay
between
the
lines
if
i
could
only
be
with
him
she
thought
and
she
longed
to
be
able
to
send
him
an
answer
but
she
had
never
learnt
properly
how
to
write
or
to
compose
a
letter
with
some
difficulty
however
and
after
several
ineffectual
attempts
she
managed
to
put
two
lines
together
which
she
remembered
from
the
catechism
to
my
lover
salvé
kristiansen
you
shall
put
your
trust
in
god
and
after
him
in
me
before
all
others
who
careth
for
you
in
all
things
and
have
faith
in
me
that
is
the
truth
from
your
elizabeth
raklev
and
in
the
spring
elizabeth
kristiansen
she
folded
the
letter
and
got
one
of
garvloit
sons
to
write
the
address
but
that
it
might
be
certain
to
go
she
went
with
it
herself
to
the
salvé
received
it
one
day
with
great
surprise
he
guessed
from
whom
it
came
and
delayed
opening
it
in
the
fear
that
it
might
contain
a
breaking
off
of
their
engagement
occasioned
by
his
own
letter
he
remembered
that
first
morning
in
amsterdam
what
was
his
joy
then
when
he
found
what
the
contents
actually
were
he
seemed
to
have
the
thing
now
in
he
put
the
letter
carefully
back
into
his
every
time
after
reading
it
and
for
a
while
was
quite
another
man
still
it
was
high
time
that
the
ice
should
begin
to
break
up
and
that
he
should
find
occupation
for
his
thoughts
in
work
he
had
begun
to
be
afraid
to
be
alone
with
them
his
first
voyage
was
to
pürmurende
and
thence
to
amsterdam
and
they
determined
to
be
married
there
and
then
although
he
had
but
four
days
to
stay
while
the
brig
was
loading
in
pürmurende
out
of
consideration
for
the
garvloits
whom
they
wished
to
spare
the
expense
of
the
wedding
as
much
as
possible
they
insisted
that
they
would
be
married
on
the
day
they
were
to
leave
for
pürmurende
the
morning
on
which
the
wedding
took
place
garvloit
house
put
forth
all
its
splendour
dress
suits
from
former
days
of
better
circumstances
were
brought
out
from
old
boxes
for
the
occasion
and
madam
garvloit
appeared
in
a
dress
of
stiff
brocade
with
a
massive
brooch
and
a
huge
gilt
comb
that
shone
over
her
forehead
like
a
piece
of
a
crown
garvloit
too
did
his
best
but
his
utmost
endeavour
had
only
availed
to
adapt
one
article
of
his
grandfather
state
dress
to
his
corpulent
person
a
waistcoat
namely
which
was
much
too
long
for
him
and
which
appeared
to
occasion
him
extreme
discomfort
in
the
region
of
the
buttons
a
couple
of
old
friends
of
the
family
and
the
children
went
with
the
pair
to
church
and
also
the
skipper
son
from
vlieland
over
whose
round
soft
cheeks
there
trickled
a
regretful
tear
or
two
as
the
bride
with
her
myrtle
wreath
and
long
white
veil
was
led
up
to
the
altar
by
garvloit
elizabeth
wore
that
day
a
pair
of
particularly
handsome
shoes
with
silver
buckles
which
salvé
with
glad
surprise
recognised
as
the
ones
he
had
presented
to
her
many
years
before
there
was
an
entertainment
provided
by
madam
garvloit
when
they
returned
from
church
which
was
not
a
very
lively
affair
the
garvloits
not
being
in
spirits
at
the
prospect
of
losing
elizabeth
and
she
notwithstanding
all
her
present
happiness
being
really
sorry
to
go
a
couple
of
hours
after
they
were
on
their
way
to
pürmurende
and
later
on
in
the
mellow
evening
were
standing
together
on
the
deck
of
the
apollo
as
she
was
being
towed
up
the
wide
canal
the
bells
were
ringing
out
from
alkmar
as
they
passed
ringing
a
sweet
old
chime
of
other
days
and
as
they
stood
together
by
the
ship
side
silently
listening
to
the
changing
tones
from
the
tower
as
they
mingled
in
the
air
above
them
they
pleased
themselves
with
the
thought
that
it
was
their
wedding
chime
chapter
xxi
in
a
small
house
at
tonsberg
at
the
entrance
to
the
beautiful
christiana
fjord
the
first
summer
of
their
married
life
passed
without
a
cloud
upon
its
sky
the
house
and
all
about
it
with
its
flowers
in
each
window
were
a
model
of
neatness
and
dutch
polish
and
with
elizabeth
herself
as
a
centre
to
it
all
it
was
no
wonder
that
crew
found
him
indifferent
to
all
weathers
when
it
was
a
question
of
getting
home
the
charming
young
skipper
wife
however
during
her
frequent
absences
had
attracted
the
notice
of
some
of
the
leading
families
of
the
town
and
had
come
presently
to
be
if
not
exactly
on
intimate
terms
at
all
events
on
a
footing
of
acquaintanceship
with
many
of
them
and
salvé
enjoyment
of
his
home
ceased
then
to
be
so
perfectly
unalloyed
when
elizabeth
recounted
to
him
the
flattering
proofs
of
appreciation
which
she
received
he
listened
in
silence
and
her
social
successes
instead
of
giving
him
pleasure
had
a
precisely
opposite
effect
he
would
not
for
the
world
have
said
a
word
to
express
his
dislike
of
her
making
such
acquaintances
and
he
even
when
they
went
to
church
together
on
sundays
liked
her
to
be
as
as
any
of
these
fine
friends
who
now
seemed
to
share
his
wife
with
him
but
if
he
said
nothing
and
was
even
angry
with
himself
for
thinking
about
the
subject
still
he
did
think
about
it
and
with
increasing
irritation
he
could
not
get
the
idea
out
of
his
head
that
elizabeth
must
now
be
always
contrasting
him
unfavourably
with
these
people
and
as
he
paced
the
deck
of
his
brig
alone
out
at
sea
he
would
picture
them
to
himself
as
constantly
in
his
house
and
always
talking
on
the
subject
which
he
could
least
endure
the
sacrifice
which
elizabeth
must
have
made
to
become
his
wife
when
their
son
gjert
was
born
in
the
spring
following
their
marriage
he
had
been
sitting
by
elizabeth
bedside
unable
to
tear
himself
away
from
her
and
the
cradle
until
a
small
present
arrived
from
one
of
her
friends
in
the
town
who
with
others
had
often
sent
to
inquire
after
her
when
he
got
up
and
went
straight
out
of
the
house
and
paced
backwards
and
forwards
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
outside
as
she
could
see
through
the
window
thoroughly
out
of
humour
though
when
he
came
in
again
he
was
even
more
affectionate
and
attentive
to
her
than
before
as
she
never
for
a
moment
imagined
that
he
could
think
her
deep
love
for
him
could
be
in
any
way
affected
by
the
slight
surface
interest
which
her
new
acquaintances
afforded
her
she
looked
upon
his
jealousy
of
them
of
which
she
had
had
indications
often
enough
before
as
a
weakness
merely
to
which
he
ought
to
have
been
superior
and
as
he
said
nothing
himself
on
the
subject
she
also
let
it
pass
without
comment
on
her
side
but
determined
at
the
same
time
that
she
would
see
less
of
them
in
future
at
all
events
while
he
was
at
home
it
happened
however
unluckily
some
weeks
afterwards
that
she
had
just
been
talking
to
some
of
them
when
he
returned
from
an
expedition
to
notterö
to
hire
a
crew
for
his
next
voyage
to
amsterdam
on
which
she
was
to
accompany
him
herr
jurgensen
and
his
wife
she
said
had
just
passed
and
she
had
been
talking
to
them
they
were
to
start
for
frederiksvoern
on
the
following
day
and
fancy
she
went
on
with
animation
fru
jurgensen
knows
marie
forstberg
so
i
asked
her
to
remember
me
to
her
marie
forstberg
who
is
she
asked
salvé
she
who
was
so
kind
to
me
she
stopped
here
and
the
colour
came
and
went
in
her
face
as
she
continued
it
was
she
who
married
son
the
lieutenant
you
ought
to
have
asked
fru
jurgensen
to
remember
me
to
beck
then
at
the
same
time
he
said
cuttingly
and
went
past
her
into
the
house
without
looking
her
in
the
face
elizabeth
followed
him
feeling
very
uncomfortable
and
after
standing
for
a
moment
in
indecision
went
over
to
him
and
sitting
down
on
his
knee
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
saying
you
are
not
angry
with
me
are
you
i
did
think
you
would
mind
or
i
would
have
done
it
oh
it
quite
immaterial
to
me
of
course
who
you
send
your
love
to
she
was
my
best
friend
when
i
was
in
arendal
elizabeth
said
avoiding
the
mention
of
beck
name
again
i
do
doubt
you
are
on
the
best
possible
terms
with
all
these
people
salvé
said
impatiently
and
making
a
movement
as
if
he
would
get
up
from
his
seat
it
was
elizabeth
who
rose
first
salvé
she
exclaimed
and
was
about
to
add
more
when
he
pulled
her
down
to
him
again
and
said
in
a
gentle
tone
of
remorse
forgive
me
elizabeth
i
did
mean
what
i
said
but
i
do
so
hate
hearing
you
talk
of
these
people
elizabeth
burst
into
tears
protesting
against
his
want
of
confidence
in
her
and
salvé
now
thoroughly
distressed
at
the
result
of
his
want
of
overwhelmed
her
with
tenderness
in
his
endeavours
to
appease
her
he
succeeded
after
a
while
and
the
evening
was
passed
in
such
sunshine
as
only
succeeds
to
storm
after
a
quarrel
of
the
kind
however
there
must
be
always
something
left
behind
and
though
salvé
was
doubly
affectionate
for
many
days
afterwards
he
grew
more
and
more
silent
and
presently
even
irritable
and
moody
and
would
not
go
to
church
on
any
of
the
succeeding
sundays
while
he
remained
at
home
chapter
xxii
elizabeth
carried
out
her
intention
of
accompanying
him
to
amsterdam
where
she
paid
a
visit
of
several
days
to
the
garvloits
and
the
pleasure
of
the
trip
was
only
alloyed
for
her
by
the
change
which
had
come
over
salvé
manner
and
to
which
she
had
now
to
try
and
accustom
herself
as
one
does
to
a
less
brilliant
light
after
having
seen
the
sun
they
were
on
their
way
home
again
sailing
before
a
light
breeze
and
under
a
soft
blue
sky
out
of
the
busy
shallow
zuyder
zee
elizabeth
was
sitting
on
deck
with
little
gjert
blooming
as
a
rose
and
asking
animated
questions
of
the
pilot
whom
they
had
been
compelled
to
take
on
board
about
the
various
flat
sandy
islands
and
towns
which
came
in
sight
from
time
to
time
salvé
occasionally
stopping
in
his
walk
to
listen
by
terschelling
the
channel
from
the
zuyder
zee
to
the
north
sea
is
marked
out
like
a
narrow
strait
with
black
and
red
buoys
and
even
in
that
calm
weather
there
were
foaming
breakers
the
whole
way
close
to
the
ship
on
either
side
what
must
it
be
like
elizabeth
asked
in
a
sort
of
terror
in
a
storm
when
the
whole
sea
was
driving
in
that
is
a
sight
it
better
not
to
see
replied
the
pilot
but
you
have
to
be
out
storm
or
not
pilot
it
is
my
way
of
getting
a
living
he
answered
shortly
salvé
stood
and
listened
as
the
conversation
took
this
turn
we
have
pilots
in
norway
too
she
said
who
do
mind
a
wet
jacket
either
it
is
a
fine
life
the
dutchman
merely
observed
coldly
in
reply
in
two
successive
years
it
is
three
years
ago
now
they
lost
out
here
off
amland
a
total
of
fifty
pilots
still
it
is
a
fine
life
she
said
and
salvé
resumed
his
walk
a
couple
of
evenings
after
the
apollo
was
pitching
out
on
the
doggerbank
in
the
moonlight
with
a
reef
in
her
topsails
elizabeth
had
not
yet
gone
below
and
was
sitting
with
her
child
warmly
wrapped
up
on
her
lap
while
salvé
paced
the
deck
and
looked
at
her
from
time
to
time
a
little
farther
off
near
the
nils
buvaagen
whom
salvé
had
met
again
at
notterö
and
persuaded
to
take
service
with
him
and
a
couple
of
the
crew
who
were
off
duty
were
engaged
in
the
others
lounging
about
near
them
to
listen
elizabeth
too
was
listening
they
had
crossed
that
day
a
long
stretch
of
dead
water
and
the
carpenter
had
several
mysterious
incidents
of
which
he
declared
he
had
been
an
eyewitness
to
recount
on
the
head
of
it
meeting
dead
water
like
that
out
in
the
open
sea
generally
meant
that
something
was
going
to
happen
nils
buvaagen
like
all
fjord
peasants
had
a
strong
leaning
towards
every
kind
of
superstition
and
in
his
many
voyages
across
the
north
sea
he
had
had
more
than
one
experience
of
the
kind
in
question
he
had
sat
quite
silent
so
far
h
he
remarked
now
thoughtfully
taking
a
pull
at
his
pipe
i
dare
be
sworn
there
many
a
one
out
here
on
the
dogger
where
we
are
now
i
tell
you
is
as
it
might
be
an
old
with
that
he
retired
into
himself
and
began
to
pull
away
vigorously
at
his
pipe
as
if
he
had
unintentionally
said
more
than
he
exactly
liked
but
being
pressed
to
go
on
he
was
obliged
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
he
had
excited
and
resumed
accordingly
in
a
hushed
tone
after
cautiously
looking
round
first
do
you
know
he
asked
mysteriously
how
all
the
old
fish
come
by
their
deaths
none
of
his
audience
were
able
to
give
an
answer
to
this
unexpected
question
you
do
he
continued
nor
no
one
else
neither
but
all
the
same
such
myriads
die
every
day
that
if
all
was
right
the
whole
surface
of
the
sea
would
be
covered
with
their
white
bellies
we
should
be
sailing
all
day
long
through
dead
fish
it
is
a
the
same
as
it
is
what
becomes
of
all
the
old
ships
in
the
world
coming
from
him
that
word
mystery
had
something
very
weird
and
uncanny
about
it
yes
the
dogger
can
be
ugly
enough
and
may
be
so
perhaps
before
we
are
clear
of
it
he
concluded
and
leant
back
against
the
spar
behind
him
to
look
up
at
the
clouds
some
scud
was
driving
at
the
moment
across
the
full
moon
but
about
the
old
fish
and
the
old
vessels
nils
said
the
carpenter
recalling
him
to
the
subject
yes
it
is
here
to
the
dogger
bank
that
they
resort
for
the
most
part
and
to
one
or
two
other
places
perhaps
in
the
world
besides
that
is
the
reason
that
there
is
always
a
sort
of
corpse
sand
in
the
water
here
and
so
many
noises
and
things
that
one
ca
explain
there
was
a
general
start
as
he
said
this
and
they
looked
at
one
another
in
silence
for
it
seemed
as
if
the
vessel
had
suddenly
stopped
with
a
shock
in
the
middle
of
her
course
and
the
spray
from
a
heavy
sea
came
pouring
down
over
the
deck
she
heard
it
said
the
carpenter
involuntarily
she
is
an
old
craft
and
does
like
going
over
the
churchyard
elizabeth
thought
that
last
proposition
sounded
so
uncomfortable
that
she
got
up
and
went
below
to
bed
the
sea
ran
high
in
the
night
and
the
vessel
kept
pitching
with
dull
thuds
as
if
they
were
in
very
shoal
water
which
however
the
lead
showed
not
to
be
the
case
in
the
morning
the
of
the
anchor
was
found
tossed
by
the
force
of
the
seas
right
over
the
deck
and
arranged
there
with
a
certain
regularity
to
many
of
the
crew
it
seemed
clear
that
other
than
natural
causes
must
have
been
at
work
there
were
evidently
dead
hands
upon
the
bank
and
this
was
a
warning
nils
shook
his
head
and
said
nothing
all
the
morning
they
were
enveloped
in
a
thick
sea
fog
that
surrounded
them
like
a
wall
but
towards
noon
the
sun
began
to
appear
like
a
sickly
gleam
above
them
and
by
they
were
sailing
under
a
clear
sky
and
in
a
fresh
green
breezy
sea
with
sails
on
every
side
it
was
an
exhilarating
sight
and
reminded
elizabeth
of
the
days
of
her
childhood
she
called
salvé
over
to
share
her
enjoyment
of
it
of
all
the
vessels
in
sight
the
handsomest
without
comparison
was
the
north
star
a
norwegian
corvette
well
known
along
the
coast
of
norway
and
which
had
often
aroused
elizabeth
enthusiasm
in
earlier
days
she
was
crossing
their
course
and
standing
under
full
sail
for
the
channel
elizabeth
recognised
her
at
once
and
exclaimed
decisively
that
is
the
north
star
is
she
a
magnificent
ship
salvé
see
they
are
taking
in
the
topsails
they
look
like
a
flock
of
birds
up
there
on
the
yard
among
those
beautiful
big
sails
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
grand
as
her
shape
and
how
majestically
she
ploughs
through
the
sea
when
she
has
all
her
canvas
spread
like
that
i
could
fancy
tordenskjold
himself
on
board
of
her
in
full
chase
salvé
looked
straight
before
him
and
did
answer
he
knew
what
elizabeth
had
not
the
faintest
suspicion
of
that
lieutenant
beck
was
on
board
the
north
star
as
third
in
command
for
that
year
cruise
in
the
mediterranean
whither
she
was
now
bound
and
a
host
of
unpleasant
associations
were
raised
by
elizabeth
innocent
admiration
of
her
it
was
the
north
star
she
continued
that
beat
through
the
straits
of
gibraltar
against
the
current
when
none
of
the
others
could
the
north
star
had
long
ago
taken
the
place
of
the
naiad
as
her
heroine
ship
and
she
related
the
performance
with
a
certain
pride
how
would
you
like
to
be
in
command
of
a
ship
like
that
salvé
she
asked
determined
to
wake
him
up
and
get
an
answer
it
would
be
a
very
different
thing
from
having
such
an
old
tub
as
the
apollo
under
one
there
no
disputing
that
he
replied
bitterly
and
quitted
her
side
abruptly
as
if
to
give
orders
to
the
crew
elizabeth
remained
standing
where
she
was
utterly
puzzled
what
could
there
possibly
have
been
in
what
she
had
said
to
offend
him
and
offended
he
certainly
was
by
the
tone
of
voice
in
which
he
was
giving
his
orders
and
the
expression
of
his
face
as
he
stood
there
by
the
wheel
with
his
hand
in
the
breast
of
his
she
felt
certain
it
was
clenched
there
it
was
really
too
unreasonable
the
idea
of
his
being
jealous
of
a
ship
this
uncertainty
about
every
word
she
spoke
now
was
getting
absolutely
insupportable
and
with
a
toss
of
her
head
she
determined
that
she
would
stand
it
no
longer
but
would
speak
her
mind
to
him
once
for
all
whether
it
should
lead
to
a
scene
or
not
no
opportunity
however
for
carrying
out
her
intention
occurred
during
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
there
appeared
to
be
bad
weather
coming
up
and
many
of
the
sails
had
to
be
taken
in
and
afterwards
he
paced
up
and
down
by
the
forward
for
a
couple
of
hours
purposely
as
she
could
see
avoiding
her
the
crew
apparently
had
an
impression
too
that
it
was
as
well
to
keep
out
of
his
way
as
they
left
him
that
side
of
the
deck
to
himself
and
stood
talking
in
knots
about
the
capstan
with
their
oilskin
coats
and
on
in
anticipation
of
dirty
weather
and
casting
anxious
glances
from
time
to
time
at
the
banks
of
cloud
that
were
rolling
up
darkly
from
the
horizon
to
leeward
and
sending
already
a
whine
through
the
old
rigging
above
them
they
waited
impatiently
for
the
word
to
take
in
more
sail
as
it
was
obvious
that
they
must
go
with
storm
sails
only
for
the
night
it
was
only
at
the
last
moment
apparently
that
salvé
made
up
his
mind
for
when
he
suddenly
shouted
over
to
them
to
take
in
topsails
and
put
a
couple
of
reefs
in
the
mainsail
the
storm
was
already
upon
them
he
sprang
aft
at
the
same
time
and
seized
the
trumpet
saying
shortly
and
harshly
to
elizabeth
as
he
passed
her
hurriedly
and
almost
without
looking
at
her
this
is
not
weather
for
sitting
up
on
deck
elizabeth
you
had
better
take
the
child
below
and
lie
down
elizabeth
saw
that
he
was
right
and
went
but
there
was
a
look
of
pained
surprise
in
her
face
as
she
lingered
for
a
moment
and
looked
after
him
he
had
never
spoken
to
her
like
that
before
the
crew
had
supposed
that
he
would
of
course
keep
away
and
run
before
the
gale
and
not
strain
the
old
brig
by
beating
to
windward
in
such
a
night
as
they
saw
before
them
and
it
was
under
mute
protest
therefore
that
they
proceeded
to
carry
out
his
orders
to
clap
on
preventer
braces
on
the
rags
of
sail
which
they
were
carrying
the
old
blocks
creaked
and
screamed
in
the
increasing
darkness
above
the
rattle
of
the
hail
squalls
and
the
vessel
careened
over
and
went
plunging
into
the
head
seas
with
successive
shocks
that
seemed
likely
very
soon
to
shake
her
to
pieces
nils
buvaagen
was
standing
in
moody
silence
with
another
at
the
wheel
and
he
could
see
by
the
light
from
the
binnacle
which
occasionally
fell
upon
salvé
face
as
he
walked
up
and
down
near
them
to
leeward
that
he
was
ashy
pale
he
would
have
liked
to
say
something
but
it
did
seem
advisable
topsail
flapping
came
from
forward
she
be
taken
aback
she
an
old
craft
captain
her
topmasts
not
bear
a
great
deal
nils
ventured
to
observe
i
show
you
that
i
can
make
the
old
tub
go
muttered
salvé
between
his
teeth
affecting
not
to
have
heard
what
was
said
keep
her
away
nils
she
must
have
more
way
and
so
over
on
a
new
tack
was
his
reply
in
a
peremptory
tone
stand
by
to
ship
nils
sighed
such
sailing
was
quite
indefensible
and
there
was
not
one
of
the
crew
who
had
not
the
same
feeling
through
the
darkness
and
the
blinding
dash
of
the
seas
came
then
at
intervals
haul
in
the
boom
hard
brace
forward
brace
aft
and
here
there
was
a
longer
interval
for
one
of
the
ropes
on
the
foremast
had
apparently
got
foul
and
there
was
a
difficulty
in
bracing
the
yard
the
sail
flapping
with
a
dull
noise
above
and
making
the
whole
mast
tremble
one
of
the
crew
had
to
mount
the
old
rigging
at
the
risk
of
his
life
and
feel
over
the
unsteady
yard
in
the
dark
for
the
rope
and
disentangle
it
with
the
white
tops
of
the
seas
breaking
not
far
under
his
feet
sharp
up
aft
sharp
forward
came
then
again
haul
the
but
no
sooner
was
the
jib
hauled
taut
and
made
fast
than
it
broke
loose
and
hung
fluttering
wildly
about
the
stay
until
it
gradually
twisted
itself
up
into
a
tangle
the
sails
filled
on
the
new
tack
but
they
were
not
much
better
off
than
before
the
sea
breaking
over
them
with
such
violence
that
the
deck
from
amidships
forward
was
only
passable
with
the
greatest
difficulty
and
danger
the
crew
began
to
think
the
captain
must
have
taken
leave
of
his
senses
and
in
fact
salvé
was
not
himself
that
night
he
was
sailing
in
this
reckless
way
in
a
mere
fit
of
temper
intensified
by
the
consciousness
of
his
own
unreasonableness
elizabeth
made
a
mistake
he
told
himself
by
way
of
justification
if
she
thought
that
he
on
board
his
poor
brig
gave
in
to
any
officer
in
the
navy
let
him
be
who
he
might
she
should
see
that
he
too
was
a
man
who
could
beat
he
required
no
north
star
under
him
he
would
perform
the
same
feat
in
a
leaky
old
barge
a
couple
of
times
when
the
cook
who
looked
after
elizabeth
wants
came
up
the
cabin
stairs
salvé
inquired
how
she
was
getting
on
and
heard
each
time
that
she
was
sitting
up
not
yet
undressed
the
last
time
the
cook
had
added
she
wants
badly
to
see
you
captain
she
is
accustomed
to
this
sort
of
thing
he
made
no
reply
further
than
a
scornful
contraction
of
his
features
which
was
not
visible
to
the
other
and
resumed
his
staggering
walk
to
leeward
between
the
companion
and
the
wheel
elizabeth
meanwhile
had
been
sitting
a
prey
to
most
distracted
thoughts
when
she
went
below
with
her
child
she
had
a
dull
feeling
at
her
heart
that
some
great
sorrow
had
come
or
was
coming
over
her
and
she
had
sat
for
some
time
almost
without
the
power
to
think
he
had
never
treated
her
like
that
before
she
set
about
putting
the
child
to
bed
then
in
her
usual
way
as
if
she
had
been
a
mere
machine
for
him
the
rolling
berth
was
only
a
rocking
cradle
and
he
was
soon
sleeping
quietly
without
an
idea
of
danger
she
stood
with
her
arm
leaning
over
the
edge
of
the
berth
supporting
him
and
gazing
on
his
dimpled
face
the
lamp
that
swung
to
and
fro
under
the
beam
shedding
a
dim
light
over
the
narrow
cabin
with
its
small
table
and
pegs
full
of
seamen
clothes
moving
solemnly
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
wall
between
the
creaking
of
the
ship
timbers
and
the
noise
of
ropes
being
dragged
across
the
deck
salvé
voice
could
be
heard
in
harsh
tones
of
command
and
every
now
and
then
there
would
be
a
sudden
concussion
that
would
make
the
whole
vessel
shake
and
the
floor
would
seem
to
go
from
under
her
feet
so
that
she
had
to
hold
on
by
the
rail
of
the
berth
and
keep
the
child
from
falling
out
as
best
she
could
at
the
same
time
whenever
they
had
had
such
weather
before
salvé
had
always
come
down
from
time
to
time
to
see
her
now
she
did
know
what
to
think
from
what
the
cook
had
told
her
she
gathered
that
they
were
beating
with
unjustifiable
recklessness
and
from
the
tone
of
voice
she
knew
that
he
was
in
a
savagely
defiant
mood
and
that
she
for
some
reason
or
other
was
the
cause
of
it
her
expression
gradually
changed
to
one
of
deeper
and
deeper
anxiety
of
soul
but
what
have
i
done
to
him
she
exclaimed
impetuously
and
buried
her
face
in
the
bedclothes
what
have
i
done
to
him
she
repeated
what
can
he
believe
what
can
he
possibly
think
she
asked
herself
as
she
stood
now
like
a
statue
almost
lost
in
conjecture
until
the
thought
which
she
had
always
tried
to
keep
away
came
up
before
her
in
full
heavy
unmistakable
clearness
he
does
trust
me
she
whispered
to
herself
in
despair
he
has
no
faith
in
me
and
she
laid
her
head
her
beautiful
head
down
upon
her
arm
just
as
her
own
child
might
have
done
in
an
inconsolable
fit
of
crying
but
to
her
no
tears
would
come
and
she
seemed
to
see
an
abyss
of
suspicion
and
distrust
before
her
in
which
salvé
love
for
her
was
going
to
disappear
she
heard
no
longer
the
creaking
and
the
noise
on
deck
no
longer
cared
about
the
lurching
and
the
thuds
against
the
although
she
had
often
to
hold
on
to
the
berth
with
all
her
strength
all
the
energy
of
her
soul
was
now
occupied
with
this
one
awful
terror
which
had
taken
possession
of
her
all
her
defiance
was
gone
her
only
source
of
courage
now
was
to
do
anything
or
everything
to
keep
his
love
she
felt
ready
for
any
sacrifice
whatever
ready
without
a
sigh
to
bear
the
burden
of
his
suspicions
all
her
life
through
if
she
might
only
keep
his
love
it
was
she
who
had
made
him
distrustful
and
it
was
upon
her
the
punishment
should
fall
if
she
could
not
by
persistent
love
bring
him
back
to
a
healthy
condition
of
mind
again
her
instinct
at
once
suggested
to
her
how
she
should
begin
he
should
see
that
she
on
her
side
had
entire
confidence
in
him
confidence
as
absolute
as
the
child
there
who
was
sleeping
before
her
and
with
a
sickly
smile
upon
her
lips
she
undressed
and
laid
herself
down
beside
little
gjert
upon
deck
salvé
had
wanted
the
which
was
down
in
the
cabin
the
man
had
fancied
that
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
for
a
moment
of
a
light
in
which
case
against
salvé
calculations
they
must
be
under
jutland
his
pride
however
would
not
allow
him
to
send
any
one
else
to
fetch
the
glass
and
he
could
make
up
his
mind
to
go
down
himself
at
last
it
became
absolutely
necessary
and
he
went
hurriedly
down
the
stair
when
he
opened
the
cabin
door
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
in
surprise
and
looked
about
him
he
had
expected
to
find
elizabeth
sitting
up
with
the
child
on
her
lap
and
looking
frightened
in
place
of
that
all
was
quiet
and
the
lamp
was
nearly
out
he
strode
on
and
took
the
glass
from
the
wall
and
after
a
couple
of
attempts
managed
to
light
a
match
in
spite
of
the
damp
and
held
it
to
the
barometer
he
remained
then
standing
with
it
in
his
hand
and
listened
to
hear
whether
she
was
asleep
or
not
involuntarily
he
approached
the
berth
and
looked
into
it
elizabeth
he
whispered
softly
as
if
he
was
afraid
of
waking
her
is
that
you
salvé
was
the
reply
in
a
perfectly
calm
voice
i
thought
you
would
be
sitting
up
with
the
boy
in
this
gale
she
rolls
so
and
i
i
have
been
down
to
see
you
he
said
i
knew
i
had
you
on
deck
salvé
she
replied
the
rest
we
must
only
leave
to
god
you
have
not
had
time
to
come
down
poor
fellow
she
added
you
have
been
so
busy
elizabeth
he
exclaimed
with
a
sudden
pang
of
passionate
remorse
and
reached
over
impetuously
into
the
berth
to
embrace
her
with
his
wet
clothes
at
that
moment
a
crash
was
heard
accompanied
by
a
violent
trembling
of
the
ship
and
loud
cries
on
deck
something
had
evidently
given
way
with
the
same
movement
with
which
he
had
intended
to
embrace
her
he
lifted
her
quickly
out
of
the
berth
and
told
her
to
dress
herself
and
the
child
and
come
up
to
the
top
of
the
cabin
stairs
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
the
vessel
heeled
over
and
did
right

turned
to
her
for
a
moment
with
a
face
full
of
mute
crushing
and
sprang
up
on
deck
keep
her
away
if
she
answer
her
helm
he
shouted
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
to
the

the

lay
over
on
one
side
with
her
brittle
rigging
at
the
mercy
of
the

and

making
a
clean
breach
over
her
salvé
himself
went
up
and
cut
away
the
topmast
which
went
over
the
side
to
leeward
and
as
the
first
grey
light
of
dawn
appeared
and
made
the
figures
of
the
crew
dimly
distinguishable
the
axes
were
still
being
feverishly
plied
in
strong
hands
among
the
stays
backstays
and
topmast
rigging
while
the
work
was
going
on
the
fearful
rolling
caused
first
the
sail
to
go
and
then
the
topsail
with
the
yards
and
all
belonging
to
it
the
forestay
snapped
the
mainsail
split
and
the
lower
yards
and
foremast
were
damaged
and
when
at
last
after
desperate
efforts
they
had
succeeded
in
freeing
the
ship
from
the
encumbrance
of
the
fallen
rigging
she
lay
there
more
than
half
a
wreck
and
scarcely
capable
of
doing
more
than
run
before
the
wind
they
had
only
the
now
and
the
forecourse
left
and
with
these
salvé
kept
her
away
it
was
the
only
thing
now
to
be
done
until
the
growing
light
should
show
them
whether
they
had
or
the
dreaded
jutland
coast
before
them
the
last
with
this
westerly
gale
blowing
would
mean
pretty
nearly
for
a
certainty
stranding
upon
the
sandbanks
and
the
vessel
becoming
a
wreck
when
it
was
clear
day
they
made
out
horn
reef
far
down
to
the
they
lay
about
off
ringkjobing
fjord
and
would
require
now
to
do
their
utmost
to
clear
the
coast
with
some
difficulty
they
succeeded
in
rigging
up
a
and
managed
by
that
means
to
keep
up
a
little
closer
in
the
wind
but
their
only
chance
was
that
the
wind
might
go
down
or
shift
a
little
to
the
southward
or
in
the
current
which
generally
takes
a
northerly
direction
here
unless
it
should
set
them
in
too
much
under
land
salvé
paced
restlessly
up
and
down
his
dismantled
deck
where
a
great
part
of
the
bulwarks
and
the
forward
were
stove
in
whilst
the
crew
relieved
each
other
two
and
two
at
the
pumps
they
had
evidently
sprung
a
serious
leak
which
was
the
more
cause
for
anxiety
that
they
were
returning
in
ballast
and
had
no
timber
cargo
to
keep
them
afloat
he
had
confided
their
situation
to
elizabeth
i
am
afraid
we
may
be
obliged
to
beach
her
at
some
convenient
spot
he
said
adding
with
a
slight
quiver
in
his
voice
we
shall
lose
the
brig
he
laid
emphasis
upon
this
because
he
did
wish
to
tell
her
the
worst
namely
that
this
convenient
spot
was
not
to
be
found
upon
the
whole
coast
and
that
their
lives
were
unmistakably
in
danger
whatever
happened
it
seemed
sufficient
for
elizabeth
that
he
was
near
her
and
there
was
a
look
of
quiet
trust
in
her
face
as
she
turned
towards
him
that
went
to
his
heart
he
could
not
bear
it
and
turned
away
the
brig
and
its
possible
loss
did
not
occupy
much
of
thoughts
in
the
midst
of
their
danger
she
was
absolutely
glad
at
heart
at
the
thought
that
by
her
display
of
implicit
confidence
she
had
succeeded
in
winning
a
great
victory
with
salvé
after
what
she
had
gone
through
that
night
this
was
everything
to
her
there
was
a
fine
energetic
look
of
determination
in
her
face
and
her
eyes
were
moist
with
tears
as
she
bent
over
the
child
in
her
lap
and
whispered
if
he
can
not
trust
us
we
two
must
teach
him
must
we
gjert
chapter
xxiii
towards
salvé
and
nils
buvaagen
were
standing
for
a
moment
together
by
the
ship
side
the
storm
had
perceptibly
lulled
but
the
weather
was
still
dull
and
hazy
and
the
sea
high
two
or
three
were
circling
drearily
between
them
and
the
coast
where
they
could
now
see
a
long
line
of
yellow
foaming
breakers
like
a
huge
wall
rising
and
falling
on
the
sandbanks
with
here
and
there
a
jet
of
spray
from
some
reef
outside
although
the
wind
was
on
shore
they
could
hear
the
dull
thunder
of
the
breakers
there
and
a
kind
of
dim
rumbling
in
the
air
the
next
three
or
four
hours
would
obviously
decide
their
fate
neither
spoke
each
was
occupied
with
his
own
reflections
nils
was
thinking
of
his
wife
and
children
at
home
and
salvé
of
his
future
it
was
hard
to
lose
the
brig
he
had
worked
hard
for
the
money
she
represented
and
he
would
have
now
to
begin
again
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
ladder
if
he
escaped
with
his
life
that
was
to
say
less
selfish
thoughts
succeeded
then
and
he
turned
to
nils
what
i
feel
most
in
this
business
nils
he
said
earnestly
is
the
thought
that
you
or
any
of
the
others
may
perhaps
pay
the
penalty
for
my
mad
sailing
last
night
with
your
lives
the
brig
is
my
own
affair
oh
it
will
be
all
right
captain
you
see
replied
nils
cheeringly
if
we
can
hang
on
to
the
old
craft
while
she
bumps
over
the
banks
we
shall
manage
somehow
or
other
inside
i
expect
god
grant
it
said
salvé
and
turned
away
nils
remained
standing
where
he
was
for
a
moment
and
something
like
a
spasm
passed
across
his
heavy
features
he
believed
their
situation
to
be
desperate
and
the
vision
of
his
home
again
rose
before
him
and
almost
choked
him
relieve
the
pumps
was
heard
it
was
his
turn
again
and
he
gave
himself
unweariedly
to
the
work
salvé
seemed
like
one
his
face
wore
an
expression
of
strained
uneasiness
and
his
look
more
and
more
as
the
moments
passed
betokened
the
consciousness
that
a
struggle
for
life
was
before
them
through
the
glass
a
knot
of
people
could
be
seen
gathering
on
the
downs
which
ran
along
the
coast
with
their
jagged
formations
showing
out
in
tones
of
dim
violet
and
blue
he
stood
now
in
the
companion
with
his
wife
and
his
child
and
sighed
heavily
as
he
looked
at
them
i
would
gladly
give
the
brig
and
be
reduced
to
my
own
two
hands
once
more
to
have
last
night
over
again
elizabeth
he
said
she
pressed
his
hand
with
an
expression
of
sympathy
which
answered
him
better
than
words
and
the
next
moment
he
was
again
the
practical
man
showing
her
how
she
might
tie
the
child
to
her
breast
with
a
handkerchief
i
ca
stay
with
you
any
longer
now
he
said
i
am
responsible
for
the
lives
of
all
on
board
and
must
do
my
duty
by
them
do
your
duty
salvé
she
said
and
so
he
concluded
as
trying
to
conceal
his
emotion
he
stroked
her
forehead
and
then
the
child
you
must
keep
a
good
heart
when
the
pinch
comes
i
shall
be
at
your
side
and
we
shall
win
through
it
see
with
god
gracious
help
she
answered
remember
that
salvé
he
strode
away
then
down
the
deck
and
called
the
crew
aft
to
take
counsel
with
him
on
the
situation
the
vessel
was
rapidly
becoming
listen
my
lads
he
said
this
is
a
serious
business
as
you
can
all
very
clearly
see
but
if
we
only
have
stout
hearts
we
may
get
out
of
it
yet
at
all
events
with
our
lives
we
have
about
three
hours
still
before
we
run
upon
the
sandbanks
but
by
that
time
it
will
have
begun
to
get
dark
and
it
may
be
difficult
for
the
people
on
shore
to
come
to
our
rescue
we
must
steer
straight
in
and
choose
the
likeliest
place
ourselves
and
if
you
are
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
we
head
for
the
shore
now
at
once
rather
than
wait
to
have
the
old
craft
flung
over
the
banks
in
the
dark
like
a
dead
fish
the
crew
were
silent
and
looked
anxiously
over
towards
the
land
but
when
nils
buvaagen
declared
himself
a
supporter
of
the
captain
plan
by
crossing
over
the
deck
to
him
all
the
others
followed
salvé
went
himself
to
the
wheel
and
gave
the
order
to
ease
off
the
sheet
ease
it
is
was
the
answer
and
that
was
the
last
order
ever
given
on
board
the
apollo
running
now
before
the
wind
they
rapidly
approached
the
land
salvé
stood
at
the
wheel
resting
his
knee
from
time
to
time
on
one
of
the
spokes
with
a
concentrated
look
on
his
dark
keen
face
and
his
eye
searching
like
a
kite
along
the
coast
for
the
place
they
were
to
make
for
a
couple
of
times
he
took
up
the
glass
and
directed
it
towards
the
downs
where
a
group
of
people
were
moving
about
the
wall
of
water
rising
and
falling
grew
higher
and
higher
as
they
approached
it
the
noise
and
the
dull
roar
of
the
breakers
became
more
and
more
deafening
and
a
feeling
of
faintness
crept
over
elizabeth
as
she
looked
towards
the
land
and
began
to
realise
their
danger
the
suspense
was
so
painfully
prolonged
a
mist
was
coming
before
her
eyes
so
that
she
could
scarcely
see
salvé
over
at
the
wheel
and
she
tried
in
her
terror
to
keep
them
fixed
upon
the
child
in
her
arms
the
seething
hissing
sound
in
the
air
around
her
kept
increasing
and
made
her
giddy
a
confusion
of
wild
sounds
that
grew
louder
and
ever
louder
seemed
to
fill
her
brain
and
before
her
eyes
there
was
nothing
but
a
whirl
of
scudding
flakes
of
white
a
mass
of
foaming
water
appeared
then
suddenly
to
rise
before
her
with
a
towering
crest
she
heard
one
loud
cry
of
terror
from
different
voices
the
brig
seemed
lifted
high
in
the
air
the
mainmast
tottered
and
a
suffocating
deluge
of
water
came
crashing
down
upon
her
nearly
carrying
her
with
it
down
the
cabin
stairs
where
she
was
clinging
again
and
again
it
came
and
her
one
thought
now
was
to
hold
fast
when
she
returned
to
consciousness
again
salvé
was
by
her
side
they
were
fastened
to
the
same
rope
and
all
the
crew
had
come
aft
and
lashed
themselves
there
the
brig
lay
over
on
her
side
upon
the
inner
bank
with
her
stern
up
and
with
the
mainmast
lying
over
the
side
she
kept
lifting
and
striking
heavily
against
the
bottom
while
heavy
seas
one
after
another
swept
her
forward
the
rigging
to
leeward
must
be
cleared
away
and
we
shall
get
off
lads
shouted
salvé
through
his
hollowed
hand
and
he
sprang
over
with
an
axe
to
do
it
nils
buvaagen
came
to
his
assistance
and
elizabeth
in
intense
anxiety
watched
the
two
men
while
they
cut
away
rope
after
rope
holding
on
by
the
rigging
all
the
time
the
sea
breaking
over
them
so
that
sometimes
they
were
hardly
visible
through
the
drench
of
water
after
one
last
stroke
which
freed
them
from
the
mast
salvé
was
by
her
side
again
the
next
moment
they
were
carried
over
the
bank
by
the
yellow
churning
surge
and
with
a
succession
of
jerks
and
bumps
over
to
the
shoal
inside
where
the
were
stove
in
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
them
salvé
said
coolly
as
it
would
relieve
the
vessel
of
the
weight
of
water
in
the
hold
and
they
might
now
be
washed
up
nearer
to
the
beach
at
length
after
a
couple
of
long
and
terrible
hours
as
twilight
was
coming
on
and
the
face
of
the
downs
was
becoming
darker
in
the
gloomy
atmosphere
it
seemed
as
if
the
vessel
had
finally
settled
the
waves
now
broke
less
frequently
over
her
but
left
a
heavy
deposit
of
sand
upon
the
deck
when
they
did
break
it
seemed
likely
that
she
would
go
to
pieces
plank
by
plank
if
they
remained
as
they
were
through
the
night
or
else
perhaps
they
would
be
buried
in
sand
on
one
side
of
the
shoal
on
the
side
where
they
saw
people
upon
the
beach
ran
a
channel
with
a
strong
current
and
they
perceived
that
they
had
been
fortunate
to
some
extent
in
not
having
been
washed
right
over
into
it
as
in
that
case
the
brig
must
inevitably
have
sunk
on
the
other
side
there
was
navigable
water
though
with
breakers
here
and
there
their
signals
they
knew
had
been
seen
by
the
people
on
shore
but
to
their
despair
they
saw
them
all
at
once
disappear
salvé
upon
that
set
to
work
to
lash
some
planks
together
for
a
raft
and
the
crew
followed
his
example
with
whatever
they
could
lay
their
hands
upon
that
would
float
his
idea
was
to
try
and
get
elizabeth
and
the
child
to
land
by
tying
them
securely
to
the
raft
and
trust
to
his
own
swimming
powers
and
address
to
reach
the
shore
with
the
line
he
was
attaching
to
it
and
the
only
question
then
would
be
whether
he
would
be
able
to
haul
it
to
land
against
the
strong
of
the
receding
waves
that
left
every
time
a
long
stretch
of
dry
sand
behind
them
elizabeth
was
sitting
meanwhile
on
the
scarcely
in
a
condition
to
comprehend
what
was
passing
as
salvé
was
occupied
with
this
work
he
suddenly
heard
a
shout
of
joy
round
him
from
behind
a
projection
in
the
downs
a
group
of
men
had
appeared
carrying
a
large
boat
they
stopped
at
a
corner
of
the
beach
a
number
of
them
took
their
seats
in
the
boat
and
as
a
wave
was
curling
over
to
break
the
others
ran
her
down
and
the
back
flow
carried
her
out
to
sea
the
men
setting
to
work
at
once
with
all
their
might
at
the
oars
the
plucky
fellows
evidently
knew
the
water
thereabouts
for
they
steered
in
a
wide
circle
up
behind
a
line
of
shoals
that
acted
like
a
mole
in
breaking
the
force
of
the
waves
and
bore
down
then
obliquely
upon
the
wreck
to
leeward
of
which
the
water
was
comparatively
smooth
now
then
look
alive
my
hearties
they
shouted
as
they
hooked
on
and
the
admonition
was
scarcely
needed
salvé
carried
his
almost
unconscious
wife
down
to
the
side
where
they
took
her
and
laid
her
aft
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
but
she
sat
up
with
outstretched
arms
until
her
child
had
been
passed
to
her
from
hand
to
hand
and
was
safe
in
them
again
and
then
she
watched
anxiously
for
salvé
to
come
too
he
sprang
down
into
the
boat
the
last
and
then
she
fainted
they
put
off
and
stood
in
now
on
the
crests
of
the
waves
straight
for
the
beach
where
a
score
of
men
in
and
woollen
jackets
made
a
chain
down
into
the
water
by
holding
each
other
hands
and
drew
the
boat
ashore
they
heard
congratulations
all
round
and
the
man
who
had
held
the
tiller
exclaimed
as
salvé
silently
grasped
his
hand
it
was
resolutely
done
northman
to
steer
like
that
only
that
you
did
you
have
passed
the
night
upon
the
bank
the
invitation
of
their
rescuers
to
partake
of
such
hospitality
as
they
could
offer
was
gladly
accepted
by
the
famished
party
from
the
wreck
and
they
followed
the
steersman
ib
mathisen
and
his
comrades
in
among
the
downs
where
the
wind
was
no
longer
felt
it
was
some
miles
to
the
fishing
village
and
they
trudged
on
after
it
grew
dark
in
silence
being
too
exhausted
and
too
dejected
to
talk
their
guides
only
keeping
up
a
low
conversation
among
themselves
salvé
carried
the
child
sheltering
it
from
the
pricking
sand
that
blew
in
their
faces
when
they
came
out
upon
the
flat
downs
farther
on
and
supporting
elizabeth
at
the
same
time
at
last
they
saw
the
lights
of
a
group
of
cottages
the
largest
of
these
belonged
to
ib
mathisen
and
into
this
salvé
and
his
wife
were
conducted
while
the
crew
were
distributed
among
the
others
ib
wife
a
woman
of
fifty
or
thereabouts
with
a
bold
straightforward
expression
in
her
tanned
countenance
was
standing
over
by
the
fire
with
her
sleeves
tucked
up
baking
when
they
came
in
she
examined
the
incomers
steadily
for
a
moment
without
raising
herself
from
her
stooping
position
but
at
the
sight
of
elizabeth
and
the
child
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
compassion
that
was
better
than
any
more
formal
welcome
the
poor
woman
and
her
child
have
been
cast
ashore
ib
and
set
about
caring
for
their
wants
at
once
her
daughter
helping
her
to
draw
a
bench
to
the
fire
for
them
and
putting
a
kettle
on
to
make
something
warm
for
them
to
drink
this
was
evidently
not
her
first
experience
of
the
kind
and
before
long
they
had
all
put
on
dry
clothes
and
elizabeth
and
the
child
were
in
a
warm
bed
as
she
went
about
she
put
questions
in
a
low
voice
to
her
husband
and
salvé
who
was
sitting
with
his
cheek
in
his
hand
staring
into
the
fire
heard
her
say
perhaps
he
was
the
owner
of
the
vessel
himself
yes
she
was
all
the
property
we
possessed
salvé
answered
quietly
but
we
are
none
the
less
grateful
to
your
husband
for
rescuing
us
and
we
have
unfortunately
very
little
to
thank
him
with
for
venturing
his
life
out
on
the
banks
in
such
weather
so
you
been
at
that
game
again
ib
said
the
wife
turning
to
her
husband
reproachfully
but
not
seeming
altogether
sincere
in
her
reproach
turning
to
salvé
then
she
said
a
little
curtly
for
the
like
of
that
we
take
no
payment
adding
in
a
milder
tone
we
have
two
sons
ourselves
who
ply
to
norway
there
a
bad
coast
there
too
salvé
was
pale
and
worn
out
with
and
after
taking
a
mouthful
of
food
he
lay
down
to
rest
but
he
could
not
sleep
and
towards
morning
he
was
lying
awake
listening
to
the
dull
booming
of
the
distant
sea
elizabeth
was
tossing
about
feverishly
and
talking
in
her
sleep
her
brain
was
evidently
busy
with
the
terrors
of
the
previous
night
and
from
occasional
words
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
a
share
in
her
thoughts
he
lay
and
listened
though
there
was
not
much
to
be
made
out
of
her
disjointed
utterances
she
grew
more
restless
and
began
to
talk
more
excitedly
never
never
she
said
vehemently
he
shall
never
hear
a
word
about
the
brig
and
she
went
on
then
in
a
confidential
whisper
shall
he
gjert
he
shall
find
us
in
our
berth
or
else
he
will
think
we
are
afraid
salvé
kissed
her
forehead
tenderly
but
with
a
sigh
there
had
been
a
motive
then
after
all
at
the
bottom
of
that
display
of
confidence
which
had
occasioned
him
such
pangs
of
a
couple
of
hours
after
he
was
on
the
way
down
to
the
sea
to
look
at
the
brig
the
general
aspect
of
the
world
about
him
was
in
harmony
with
his
mood
the
wind
whistled
over
the
dreary
whirling
the
sand
in
clouds
in
among
the
downs
that
stretched
away
like
a
sea
into
the
distance
in
every
variety
of
desolate
and
jagged
outline
upon
the
melancholy
shore
a
or
two
were
circling
round
some
old
black
stumps
of
wreck
that
protruded
from
the
sand
while
beyond
lay
the
dismal
expanse
of
the
western
sea
without
a
sail
upon
its
leaden
waste
of
waters
so
shunned
by
all
dreariness
wreck
and
desolation
were
on
every
side
and
it
seemed
to
salvé
that
it
was
only
a
reflection
of
his
own
life
he
had
got
to
be
the
owner
of
a
brig
and
there
it
lay
what
remained
of
it
buried
in
the
sand
he
had
succeeded
in
making
elizabeth
his
own
but
had
he
thereby
added
anything
to
the
happiness
of
his
life
he
stood
gazing
at
the
remains
of
his
brig
over
which
the
yellow
waves
were
breaking
in
a
state
of
gloomy
abstraction
from
which
he
was
only
aroused
by
the
approach
of
ib
mathisen
and
a
party
of
his
own
crew
who
had
followed
him
to
the
shore
to
see
if
possibly
they
might
retrieve
some
of
their
property
he
joined
them
in
the
search
and
with
but
small
result
three
ship
chests
and
the
compass
being
all
the
reward
of
an
hour
labour
among
the
and
bolts
and
pieces
of
rigging
that
strewed
the
beach
or
made
ripples
in
the
sand
for
a
long
distance
in
either
direction
they
remained
that
day
in
the
fishing
hamlet
and
when
salvé
had
made
his
declaration
before
the
authorities
and
had
paid
the
crew
what
he
owed
them
with
the
greater
part
of
the
money
he
had
saved
he
and
elizabeth
took
passage
for
christiansand
in
a
corn
ship
from
harboere
he
was
very
silent
on
the
way
thinking
about
his
future
and
the
prospect
was
not
a
bright
one
he
knew
that
there
prevailed
but
one
opinion
among
the
crew
about
the
loss
of
the
brig
that
he
had
his
own
folly
only
to
thank
for
it
and
as
this
of
course
would
get
about
his
chance
of
being
employed
as
a
skipper
by
any
shipowner
would
be
very
small
elizabeth
popularity
in
tonsberg
might
probably
be
of
service
to
him
but
he
would
sooner
starve
than
help
himself
to
a
situation
by
means
of
it
and
in
her
present
circumstances
she
should
not
even
return
to
tonsberg
one
only
course
remained
open
to
him
if
he
was
not
to
begin
again
from
the
very
beginning
he
would
become
an
uncertificated
pilot
for
the
arendal
district
no
one
knew
the
coast
there
better
than
he
did
he
had
always
had
the
idea
in
his
mind
ever
since
the
night
when
he
brought
the
juno
into
merdö
and
out
there
or
in
some
other
spot
along
the
coast
he
reflected
gloomily
that
he
could
have
elizabeth
all
to
himself
when
he
announced
his
decision
to
elizabeth
she
entered
with
animation
into
the
project
and
when
he
went
on
to
add
that
she
would
have
to
be
content
now
with
being
only
a
common
man
wife
she
replied
intrepidly
if
he
is
only
called
salvé
kristiansen
i
require
nothing
more
chapter
xxiv
it
was
so
arranged
then
and
though
elizabeth
was
rather
disappointed
to
hear
that
she
was
not
to
see
her
tidy
house
at
tonsberg
again
she
allowed
no
indication
of
the
feeling
to
escape
her
and
salvé
went
by
himself
to
arrange
their
affairs
there
when
he
had
sold
what
property
they
had
and
bought
his
they
had
still
a
small
sum
left
with
which
to
begin
housekeeping
afresh
and
merdö
was
chosen
for
their
future
residence
from
the
outside
this
island
looks
only
like
one
of
the
desolate
series
which
form
the
outworks
of
the
coast
for
miles
here
in
either
direction
with
many
a
spot
of
angry
white
marking
the
sunken
rocks
between
but
the
inner
side
forms
the
merdö
harbour
of
refuge
with
its
little
hamlet
of
fishermen
and
pilots
houses
on
the
strand
and
it
was
in
one
of
these
a
little
red
painted
house
with
a
small
porch
in
front
and
a
flagged
yard
and
garden
behind
and
which
presently
became
their
own
that
they
eventually
settled
the
coast
outside
merdö
is
exceptionally
dangerous
but
the
merdö
pilots
have
also
the
reputation
of
being
exceptionally
brave
and
skilful
they
are
also
perhaps
the
widest
known
for
having
no
defined
district
they
take
a
wide
range
and
may
be
lying
off
lindesnaes
under
the
skaw
or
the
holmen
and
the
day
after
board
a
ship
from
hamburg
right
away
down
at
horn
reef
it
is
a
common
thing
to
meet
one
of
them
with
his
arendal
mark
his
red
stripe
and
number
on
the
mainsail
trawling
for
mackerel
far
out
over
the
north
sea
and
even
down
as
far
as
the
dogger
bank
where
they
get
information
from
foreign
fishing
smacks
of
vessels
from
the
channel
or
from
english
or
dutch
ports
if
a
skipper
wants
news
from
the
north
sea
or
skager
rack
he
generally
keeps
a
for
one
of
these
and
finds
a
living
shipping
list
and
the
newest
too
on
board
which
costs
him
at
the
most
supposing
he
has
nothing
of
interest
to
impart
in
return
a
roll
of
tobacco
a
bottle
of
spirits
or
a
strand
of
rope
but
it
is
to
the
captain
who
on
some
winter
night
when
the
sea
is
running
mountains
high
has
come
in
beneath
bare
poles
under
the
torungens
and
who
knows
that
he
is
doomed
if
he
can
not
get
a
pilot
that
these
merdö
men
are
most
familiar
when
perhaps
he
has
given
up
all
hope
he
suddenly
hears
himself
hailed
from
the
darkness
a
line
is
thrown
and
a
dripping
pilot
stands
upon
the
deck
when
the
sea
is
too
rough
to
board
a
vessel
in
any
other
way
they
do
not
think
twice
about
taking
a
line
round
their
waist
and
jumping
overboard
and
when
it
is
a
point
of
honour
with
them
to
bring
in
a
ship
boat
and
home
and
life
weigh
but
very
little
in
the
opposite
scale
the
salvé
kristiansen
soon
came
to
be
the
best
known
in
arendal
of
them
all
the
dauntless
look
in
his
keen
brown
eyes
his
sharp
features
and
his
short
sudden
manner
and
way
of
speaking
gave
the
impression
of
a
character
of
uncommon
energy
and
it
was
said
that
not
the
very
wildest
weather
would
deter
him
from
going
to
sea
he
was
known
to
have
more
than
once
stayed
alone
on
board
a
vessel
while
he
sent
his
comrade
on
shore
for
help
and
in
his
little
room
at
home
with
its
windows
and
geraniums
and
dutch
there
stood
above
the
roll
of
charts
and
telescope
on
the
wall
a
bracket
with
more
than
one
silver
goblet
upon
it
which
like
the
telescope
were
presents
in
acknowledgment
of
his
services
in
piloting
vessels
into
port
under
circumstances
of
unusual
difficulty
and
danger
but
notwithstanding
the
repute
in
which
he
was
held
he
had
never
yet
received
the
medal
for
saving
life
nor
had
he
yet
been
made
a
certificated
pilot
of
the
district
he
was
not
a
man
who
gathered
comrades
round
him
and
as
the
years
passed
his
unapproachability
of
demeanour
which
seemed
intended
to
convey
to
people
with
a
certain
bitterness
that
he
could
do
very
well
without
them
increased
it
was
said
up
in
the
town
that
he
had
taken
to
drink
for
after
selling
off
his
mackerel
down
on
the
quay
he
would
often
now
sit
the
whole
day
in
mother
andersen
parlour
with
his
before
him
and
when
evening
approached
and
his
head
had
had
as
much
as
it
could
carry
it
was
just
as
well
to
keep
out
of
his
way
he
did
not
talk
much
and
what
attraction
he
found
in
mother
andersen
parlour
it
was
not
easy
to
say
but
they
knew
at
all
events
how
to
treat
him
there
and
he
felt
from
the
casual
questions
that
would
be
addressed
to
him
after
he
had
returned
from
sea
or
from
the
way
in
which
a
newcomer
would
salute
him
that
he
was
in
a
sympathetic
atmosphere
and
that
his
name
was
in
repute
it
was
even
something
more
than
respect
perhaps
which
he
inspired
for
a
sailor
would
think
twice
before
sitting
down
beside
him
unless
it
came
natural
to
him
to
do
so
from
the
way
in
which
they
had
greeted
or
spoken
to
one
other
it
was
not
however
any
attraction
which
he
found
in
mother
parlour
which
made
him
spend
so
much
of
his
time
there
it
was
that
he
was
afraid
of
his
own
temper
at
home
when
he
had
first
set
up
on
his
own
account
and
had
had
his
appointment
as
a
duly
certificated
pilot
for
the
object
of
his
ambition
he
had
never
made
it
his
habit
to
stay
in
arendal
when
he
returned
from
sea
instead
of
going
home
but
some
two
or
three
years
after
he
had
settled
out
at
merdö
a
couple
of
incidents
had
occurred
which
made
a
new
as
it
were
in
his
domestic
life
they
were
the
nomination
of
captain
beck
who
was
now
a
wealthy
man
to
the
post
of
master
of
the
pilots
of
the
district
and
who
as
such
became
his
superior
and
the
arrival
of
carl
beck
to
live
in
arendal
and
superintend
his
father
shipbuilding
yard
for
which
purpose
he
had
retired
from
the
navy
since
the
arrival
of
the
becks
he
had
become
more
and
more
difficult
to
get
on
with
and
elizabeth
secret
struggle
grew
proportionately
harder
whenever
she
returned
from
a
shopping
expedition
to
arendal
or
from
seeing
her
aunt
she
would
be
sure
to
find
him
in
an
irritable
humour
which
would
generally
vent
itself
in
contemptuous
remarks
upon
old
beck
incapacity
for
the
post
he
held
and
at
last
much
as
she
longed
to
get
a
glimpse
now
and
then
of
something
different
from
the
monotony
of
her
daily
life
out
on
merdö
she
gave
up
going
altogether
her
patience
and
had
had
the
effect
as
years
went
on
of
making
a
tyrant
of
her
husband
when
in
one
of
his
dark
moods
now
he
would
not
tolerate
the
slightest
contradiction
from
her
or
from
any
one
in
the
house
and
all
she
could
do
was
to
be
quietly
cheerful
and
affectionate
and
to
try
her
best
to
avoid
falling
into
any
of
the
traps
which
he
would
lay
to
catch
her
and
to
make
her
by
some
chance
word
or
other
or
even
by
a
slightly
displeased
or
resigned
expression
give
his
bad
humour
an
excuse
for
breaking
out
she
had
to
weigh
every
word
she
uttered
and
to
take
the
most
roundabout
methods
of
avoiding
his
sensitiveness
and
after
all
she
would
perhaps
commit
herself
when
she
least
expected
it
upon
which
a
scene
would
immediately
ensue
that
would
be
all
the
more
unpleasant
from
his
never
expressing
himself
directly
sometimes
salvé
was
really
desperate
and
would
terrify
her
with
all
kinds
of
threats
not
against
her
but
against
himself
and
she
knew
he
was
just
the
man
to
carry
them
out
it
had
often
happened
that
for
some
unlucky
word
of
hers
he
had
gone
to
sea
again
an
hour
after
coming
home
and
once
in
such
weather
that
she
had
not
the
faintest
hope
of
ever
seeing
him
return
she
would
sit
at
home
and
weep
for
hours
together
striving
to
repress
the
angry
feelings
of
resentment
which
would
rise
from
time
to
time
when
she
thought
how
little
return
she
received
for
all
she
gave
how
less
than
little
her
happiness
was
considered
and
how
meagre
a
reward
for
all
she
had
to
endure
were
the
two
or
three
days
perhaps
of
occasional
happy
calm
and
sunshine
in
her
home
when
she
seemed
to
have
him
with
her
as
he
had
been
in
the
first
early
days
of
their
married
life
and
when
he
would
find
it
as
hard
to
tear
himself
away
from
his
home
again
as
she
knew
he
had
often
found
it
to
return
what
a
heart
he
had
in
reality
she
alone
knew
that
the
others
judged
him
only
by
his
hard
and
harsh
exterior
and
how
proud
she
was
of
him
when
she
heard
the
others
talking
of
the
daring
things
he
had
done
and
saw
how
they
all
looked
up
to
him
but
it
was
not
enough
and
in
the
dulness
and
loneliness
of
her
life
out
there
on
merdö
she
enjoyed
to
the
full
during
these
many
weary
years
her
woman
privilege
of
suffering
for
the
man
she
loved
but
it
was
not
to
be
so
always
brighter
days
little
as
she
now
expected
them
were
still
in
store
for
her
chapter
xxv
we
may
leave
for
a
moment
the
contemplation
of
a
domestic
history
lighted
up
at
present
by
such
few
and
fitful
gleams
of
sunshine
and
glance
at
the
married
life
of
another
pair
who
have
figured
in
this
story
and
who
have
not
been
without
their
influence
upon
whatever
there
may
have
been
of
tragic
in
its
development
the
young
becks
as
they
were
called
in
contradistinction
to
the
master
family
were
now
among
the
first
people
in
arendal
and
kept
one
of
the
best
houses
in
the
town
which
they
had
ample
means
to
do
for
the
shipbuilding
business
brought
them
in
a
considerable
annual
income
carl
beck
had
lost
none
of
his
attractiveness
as
he
grew
older
his
curling
black
hair
had
now
an
early
sprinkling
of
grey
in
it
but
was
always
arranged
to
the
very
best
effect
and
there
was
people
said
such
a
nobleness
about
him
his
cleverness
was
undisputed
that
when
he
rose
to
propose
or
reply
to
a
toast
there
was
not
a
lady
at
the
table
who
was
not
in
a
flutter
of
inward
admiration
with
his
social
advantages
he
could
not
of
course
fail
to
be
in
a
position
of
considerable
influence
in
the
town
which
again
heightened
his
welcome
in
society
but
if
he
was
thus
made
much
of
it
was
not
altogether
the
same
with
his
wife
the
estimate
of
her
which
generally
prevailed
that
she
was
so
perfectly
correct
was
not
intended
perhaps
to
be
complimentary
but
implied
at
the
same
time
a
recognition
of
her
social
power
she
was
in
fact
her
husband
timepiece
and
without
her
tact
he
would
not
have
kept
himself
as
straight
as
he
did
in
the
midst
of
the
gushing
welcomes
which
he
found
on
all
sides
in
his
relations
with
his
wife
he
was
a
pink
of
chivalry
never
omitted
the
most
trifling
attention
and
was
always
being
complimented
on
being
a
pattern
husband
some
few
of
the
intimates
of
the
house
seemed
to
think
though
that
there
was
something
strange
in
their
attitude
to
one
another
a
sort
of
coolness
and
reserve
about
both
and
it
was
whispered
that
his
wife
did
not
appreciate
him
as
she
ought
it
seemed
as
if
the
two
talked
together
best
when
strangers
were
present
fru
beck
too
always
looked
so
uncommonly
pale
and
was
so
frigidly
calm
that
it
might
have
been
supposed
she
had
no
feelings
at
all
and
in
comparison
with
his
overflowing
warmth
of
nature
she
certainly
did
seem
dreadfully
precise
and
cold
when
they
first
came
to
frederiksværn
as
a
young
couple
her
colour
had
been
fresh
and
her
expression
showed
that
she
was
still
in
love
she
was
then
completely
under
the
spell
of
his
attractive
warmth
of
manner
and
felt
safe
in
the
possession
of
his
love
it
was
true
a
couple
of
failings
which
contrasted
strangely
with
the
idea
she
had
formed
of
him
from
his
manly
bearing
had
gradually
disclosed
themselves
namely
an
extraordinary
vanity
and
an
almost
ridiculous
dependence
upon
the
opinion
of
the
world
but
so
long
as
his
heart
was
in
the
right
place
and
she
could
feel
that
he
loved
her
these
disappointments
were
matters
of
but
secondary
consideration
to
her
she
felt
that
she
even
loved
him
all
the
more
for
these
weaknesses
and
she
trusted
to
the
power
which
she
was
gaining
over
him
more
and
more
every
day
to
get
them
presently
corrected
the
charming
lieutenant
beck
became
sought
after
everywhere
and
his
success
with
the
ladies
resulted
in
his
having
very
soon
established
sentimental
relations
with
nearly
every
member
of
the
fair
circle
around
him
he
nearly
always
had
a
flower
in
his
buttonhole
when
he
came
home
which
had
been
jokingly
given
to
him
as
a
by
some
one
or
other
of
his
admirers
he
received
presents
from
all
sides
and
they
in
fact
laid
a
sort
of
embargo
upon
him
as
an
object
of
general
admiration
there
was
nothing
to
say
against
all
this
far
from
it
but
the
only
person
who
felt
left
out
in
the
cold
was
his
own
wife
who
seemed
to
see
this
enthusiastic
crowd
gradually
establishing
as
it
were
a
prescriptive
right
of
way
between
herself
and
her
husband
and
treading
under
foot
the
very
flowers
that
should
have
grown
only
for
their
own
two
selves
in
the
intimacy
of
their
home
she
became
gradually
a
less
animated
but
was
still
he
thought
an
interested
listener
when
he
came
home
after
being
in
the
society
of
his
lady
friends
and
recounted
his
triumphs
if
this
was
so
she
at
all
events
began
to
be
more
particular
about
her
own
dress
and
appearance
and
set
to
work
now
to
systematically
cultivate
the
social
talent
which
she
naturally
possessed
she
determined
to
conquer
her
rivals
who
had
the
advantage
of
her
in
appearance
but
were
inferior
to
her
in
talent
and
she
succeeded
but
she
became
naturally
an
object
for
their
criticism
in
consequence
the
only
one
with
whom
she
did
not
succeed
was
her
husband
his
was
far
too
much
taken
up
with
the
small
flatteries
of
all
kinds
and
the
homage
of
which
he
was
the
object
to
have
any
eyes
for
the
very
great
compliment
indeed
which
was
being
paid
to
him
by
his
wife
in
the
line
which
she
had
adopted
to
her
he
was
married
and
therefore
of
her
he
was
always
sure
enough
it
was
from
that
time
that
she
dated
the
influence
which
she
usually
acquired
in
the
social
circles
she
frequented
and
which
her
position
and
circumstances
made
it
easy
for
her
to
maintain
when
they
changed
their
residence
to
arendal
but
those
first
years
of
their
married
life
had
not
passed
without
a
serious
and
to
her
completely
decisive
it
was
occasioned
by
his
relations
with
the
wife
of
an
officer
of
rank
which
had
become
really
more
intimate
than
her
pride
could
stand
although
she
knew
very
well
that
on
her
husband
side
it
was
only
a
sort
of
mixture
of
vanity
and
policy
that
prompted
his
affectation
of
devotion
she
had
treated
the
lady
with
marked
coldness
at
a
party
where
they
had
met
and
her
husband
had
taken
her
to
task
for
it
when
they
got
home
entirely
wrapped
up
in
himself
as
he
was
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
his
wife
could
have
any
cause
of
complaint
against
him
and
what
she
had
been
going
through
had
been
altogether
lost
upon
him
she
did
not
say
much
now
in
reply
to
his
reproaches
she
merely
stood
and
looked
at
him
in
a
way
that
made
him
feel
rather
uncomfortable
and
then
quietly
left
the
room
he
could
hear
her
going
with
slow
steps
up
the
stairs
an
hour
or
so
after
she
came
down
again
into
the
room
with
a
light
in
her
hand
her
expression
was
cold
and
she
did
not
look
at
him
as
she
set
about
putting
the
room
to
rights
for
the
night
as
usual
he
tried
to
pacify
her
begged
her
not
to
take
what
he
had
said
so
much
to
heart
and
was
going
to
put
his
arm
affectionately
round
her
waist
but
was
stopped
on
finding
himself
suddenly
confronted
by
the
deadly
pale
face
and
flashing
eyes
of
an
infuriated
woman
the
time
had
come
to
speak
out
and
she
did
speak
out
and
lieutenant
beck
heard
what
he
would
have
been
very
sorry
to
repeat
to
his
best
friend
for
he
felt
in
his
heart
that
it
was
nothing
but
the
truth
however
soon
he
might
forget
it
again
she
called
him
a
pitiful
wretch
who
would
sell
her
and
everything
they
jointly
prized
to
the
first
comer
for
a
little
miserable
flattery
he
had
distributed
himself
to
that
extent
among
his
giddy
acquaintance
she
went
on
with
a
movement
as
if
she
thrust
from
her
something
she
utterly
despised
that
there
was
nothing
left
of
him
for
a
woman
with
a
vestige
of
truth
or
honour
to
pick
up
when
her
husband
threw
himself
upon
the
sofa
and
exclaimed
in
a
sentimental
tone
that
he
was
a
miserable
man
she
repeated
the
last
word
twice
in
an
inexpressibly
contemptuous
tone
a
man
a
man
if
you
had
been
a
man
you
would
still
have
had
my
love
at
all
events
a
remnant
of
it
but
now
like
this
light
here
and
she
puffed
it
out
all
is
extinguished
between
us
with
that
she
left
the
room
beck
sat
where
he
was
overwhelmed
and
stupefied
at
this
sudden
blow
which
had
fallen
upon
his
domestic
happiness
and
with
a
horrible
apprehension
that
she
might
have
meant
what
she
said
in
real
earnest
she
sat
in
the
room
with
her
child
the
whole
night
and
he
knew
that
he
dared
not
disturb
her
notwithstanding
the
struggle
which
it
cost
his
pride
he
was
almost
humble
in
his
manner
towards
her
for
some
days
after
and
warmly
and
cordially
acknowledged
that
he
had
been
in
the
wrong
he
even
tried
to
show
her
that
he
was
in
earnest
by
assuming
for
a
while
an
altered
attitude
towards
the
ladies
and
actually
succeeded
so
far
that
she
appeared
to
have
forgotten
that
anything
had
occurred
between
them
and
was
just
the
same
in
her
intercourse
with
him
as
before
quietly
friendly
that
is
to
say
as
she
had
been
of
recent
years
it
never
came
to
any
real
reconciliation
on
her
side
she
had
seen
too
clearly
that
his
nature
was
only
that
of
a
drifting
cloud
glowing
for
the
moment
just
as
it
was
played
upon
by
popular
applause
and
he
was
too
profoundly
selfish
for
any
real
earnest
love
to
find
a
root
in
his
composition
much
less
to
give
promise
of
a
common
with
his
feeling
and
he
would
have
treated
any
wife
well
even
if
she
had
not
made
herself
so
necessary
to
him
as
she
was
her
social
talent
she
felt
was
her
great
safety
it
made
him
look
up
to
her
and
his
vain
nature
required
that
she
should
be
something
to
be
proud
of
but
she
was
forced
to
acknowledge
in
her
own
heart
with
despair
that
she
had
been
blinded
by
her
love
for
him
that
his
nature
was
absolutely
deficient
in
constancy
and
truth
and
in
every
quality
which
she
had
once
persuaded
herself
to
see
in
him
she
knew
the
secret
about
this
man
so
brilliant
before
the
eyes
of
the
world
that
he
was
not
a
man
he
lived
and
moved
before
her
now
like
a
defaced
ideal
to
which
she
was
tied
to
the
end
of
her
life
the
bitterness
of
disappointment
rankled
in
her
mind
and
was
all
the
more
poignant
that
she
had
to
keep
it
shut
up
within
herself
and
had
no
one
to
confide
in
her
life
had
become
a
desert
and
at
the
very
moment
when
her
husband
would
be
making
a
brilliant
little
speech
that
called
forth
applause
all
round
the
table
she
would
seem
to
hear
nothing
but
a
rattle
of
emptiness
she
always
protested
to
her
parents
when
they
could
not
understand
why
she
looked
so
pale
that
she
was
perfectly
happy
and
they
had
no
reason
to
think
otherwise
for
she
seemed
to
be
well
cared
for
in
every
respect
the
only
real
interest
which
she
possessed
now
in
life
was
her
son
frederick
but
she
brought
him
up
with
the
utmost
possible
strictness
for
she
fancied
she
detected
his
father
nature
over
again
in
him
she
had
always
retained
her
warm
interest
in
elizabeth
and
the
messages
which
she
had
received
from
her
from
time
to
time
had
always
given
her
pleasure
she
had
never
felt
so
attracted
towards
any
one
since
as
she
had
been
to
that
girl
and
now
after
her
great
disappointment
elizabeth
features
so
full
of
character
and
expression
were
constantly
before
her
she
had
seen
her
sometimes
in
arendal
and
thought
she
knew
the
reason
why
elizabeth
always
seemed
to
avoid
meeting
her
for
she
had
found
once
by
chance
among
some
old
letters
in
one
of
her
husband
drawers
the
note
which
elizabeth
had
written
to
him
it
had
been
no
shock
to
her
by
that
time
she
had
come
to
know
his
volatile
nature
and
had
given
up
all
hope
of
ever
being
more
to
him
than
another
would
be
on
the
occasions
when
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
pilot
wife
in
the
street
she
had
looked
searchingly
into
her
face
to
try
and
satisfy
herself
whether
she
looked
happy
but
she
had
not
been
able
to
do
so
there
seemed
to
be
something
on
elizabeth
mind
and
taking
this
impression
in
connection
with
what
she
heard
of
the
pilot
of
his
hardness
and
uncompanionable
temper
she
thought
that
it
was
clear
enough
that
elizabeth
too
was
unhappy
in
her
married
life
and
longed
to
have
a
talk
with
her
to
know
whether
she
herself
was
not
the
more
unhappy
of
the
two
nor
had
fru
beck
uncommon
pallor
escaped
elizabeth
notice
and
she
also
longed
to
have
a
talk
again
with
her
friend
of
former
days
but
beck
house
was
for
many
reasons
impossible
ground
for
her
as
she
was
standing
one
day
with
gjert
on
the
quay
about
to
start
for
home
fru
beck
passed
a
little
way
off
leaning
on
her
husband
arm
and
looked
back
with
an
expression
so
sad
and
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
linger
so
longingly
as
if
she
had
something
she
wanted
to
say
or
to
confide
that
they
nodded
involuntarily
to
one
another
since
then
they
had
never
met
for
from
that
time
elizabeth
had
scarcely
ever
been
in
arendal
chapter
xxvi
gjert
was
now
ten
years
old
and
whilst
his
father
was
sitting
over
his
glass
in
mother
andersen
parlour
he
used
generally
to
amuse
himself
out
in
the
harbour
with
a
number
of
the
arendal
boys
with
whom
he
had
struck
up
an
acquaintanceship
and
who
understood
very
little
about
differences
of
social
position
the
little
lad
with
his
sharp
intelligent
face
was
the
wildest
of
them
all
and
enjoyed
a
certain
consideration
among
them
at
the
same
time
as
his
father
son
an
honour
which
he
evidently
thought
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
maintain
by
every
kind
of
exploit
his
proper
business
of
course
was
to
look
after
his
father
boat
in
his
absence
but
as
it
was
safely
moored
and
could
be
seen
just
as
well
from
any
of
the
yards
in
the
harbour
he
used
generally
to
wait
in
some
such
conspicuous
position
till
his
friends
came
streaming
down
to
the
quay
from
school
and
throwing
their
books
down
sailed
out
in
some
punt
or
other
to
join
him
most
of
the
boys
had
been
expressly
warned
by
their
mothers
against
the
reckless
kristiansen
son
but
and
became
thereby
only
the
more
attractive
old
beck
grandson
frederick
who
was
going
to
be
a
naval
cadet
had
fancied
one
day
that
he
would
escape
observation
from
the
windows
at
home
by
climbing
up
to
join
his
friend
at
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
mast
but
the
slender
spar
was
not
sufficient
to
protect
him
from
the
keen
eye
and
the
latter
came
himself
on
board
in
full
grandfatherly
indignation
against
the
skipper
for
allowing
such
pranks
to
be
played
on
board
his
craft
thrashed
gjert
for
being
the
cause
of
his
grandson
disobedience
and
told
him
that
it
was
very
clear
what
he
would
come
to
some
day
that
he
came
of
a
bad
stock
and
took
after
it
his
own
little
scion
although
a
couple
of
years
older
than
gjert
escaped
punishment
altogether
the
other
lads
however
determining
among
themselves
that
he
should
have
it
the
next
time
they
met
and
he
would
have
had
it
if
gjert
who
should
have
been
the
one
more
particularly
to
desire
revenge
had
not
unexpectedly
taken
his
part
it
was
only
as
they
were
sailing
the
cutter
home
that
the
pilot
heard
how
beck
had
thrashed
his
son
and
cast
his
horoscope
his
smurched
face
grew
white
as
a
sheet
but
when
gjert
went
in
to
tell
him
how
all
the
same
he
had
taken
frederick
beck
part
his
father
looked
at
him
in
surprise
and
then
muttered
something
about
telling
this
to
his
mother
elizabeth
had
seen
the
boat
pass
merdö
for
arendal
the
day
before
and
she
was
sitting
indoors
now
expecting
her
husband
having
commissioned
their
youngest
and
only
other
son
henrik
to
keep
a
and
come
and
tell
her
when
he
saw
his
father
coming
henrik
however
had
entirely
forgotten
her
injunctions
in
the
more
interesting
occupation
of
catching
shrimps
in
one
of
the
pools
which
a
recent
high
tide
had
left
among
the
rocks
and
there
in
the
bright
afternoon
over
the
blue
and
gold
sea
dotted
with
sails
was
the
boat
with
its
stripe
and
number
already
close
by
standing
straight
in
for
the
harbour
with
a
flowing
sheet
with
all
her
deep
love
for
her
husband
elizabeth
always
awaited
his
return
now
with
a
certain
dread
and
as
she
sat
there
by
the
window
with
her
work
in
her
rather
foreign
dutch
style
of
dress
with
the
rays
of
the
evening
sun
streaming
in
upon
her
through
the
geraniums
she
did
not
look
a
happy
woman
she
was
pale
and
from
time
to
time
leaned
her
cheek
for
a
moment
on
her
hand
and
closed
her
eyes
with
a
wearied
look
and
then
went
on
again
determinedly
with
her
sewing
when
she
heard
his
voice
unexpectedly
outside
the
door
she
jumped
up
hurriedly
but
stopped
then
with
a
look
hesitating
whether
to
go
out
and
meet
him
or
not
while
she
hesitated
the
door
opened
and
her
expression
changed
at
once
to
one
of
cheerfulness
and
apparently
glad
surprise
well
mother
how
goes
it
he
cried
as
he
entered
in
a
light
and
cheery
tone
which
took
in
a
moment
a
weight
off
her
heart
and
where
is
the
a
pet
name
he
had
for
his
youngest
son
when
he
was
in
good
humour
gjert
adventure
with
beck
grandson
had
made
him
a
different
man
and
had
immeasurably
lightened
for
the
time
his
wife
task
but
she
was
very
careful
not
to
let
him
see
that
she
found
him
any
different
from
usual
still
as
she
helped
him
off
with
his
he
noticed
that
her
hand
trembled
his
attention
was
diverted
however
at
the
moment
by
the
appearance
of
henrik
in
the
doorway
looking
very
frightened
and
conscious
and
with
his
trousers
still
tucked
up
over
his
bare
legs
and
with
the
tin
cup
in
which
he
had
his
shrimps
in
his
hand
gjert
came
in
now
with
some
of
the
things
for
the
house
which
his
father
had
bought
in
arendal
and
impressing
the
bagman
into
the
service
took
him
down
with
him
to
the
boat
to
help
him
to
bring
up
the
rest
he
had
only
given
his
mother
a
hurried
kiss
as
he
had
seen
at
a
glance
that
all
was
right
this
time
when
it
was
otherwise
he
always
kept
by
her
and
in
look
and
manner
gave
her
all
the
help
he
could
he
had
seen
from
his
childhood
and
comprehended
so
much
of
the
unhappiness
of
her
relations
with
his
father
that
he
had
constituted
himself
her
friend
and
support
although
at
the
same
time
he
was
devoted
to
his
father
when
gjert
was
in
the
boat
elizabeth
had
a
sort
of
security
that
salvé
would
at
all
events
not
be
absolutely
reckless
and
gjert
always
took
care
that
she
should
have
news
of
them
by
other
pilots
or
fishermen
from
merdö
from
the
different
places
they
put
in
to
if
the
boy
was
not
with
his
father
she
would
sometimes
send
him
in
to
arendal
to
look
for
him
this
time
the
pilot
made
a
long
stay
at
home
and
during
the
whole
time
not
a
single
domestic
jar
occurred
for
a
couple
indeed
who
had
been
married
as
long
as
they
had
such
unbroken
harmony
would
under
any
circumstances
have
been
remarkable
little
henrik
had
even
had
his
father
as
a
companion
on
one
of
his
shrimping
expeditions
and
much
of
salvé
time
had
since
been
taken
up
in
rigging
a
little
brig
for
his
delighted
son
the
only
point
upon
which
a
harmless
little
difference
occurred
was
the
question
of
gjert
schooling
they
were
very
fairly
people
for
their
position
and
his
mother
had
one
day
as
if
the
idea
had
suddenly
occurred
to
her
asked
why
they
should
not
send
him
to
school
in
arendal
he
would
be
able
to
lodge
with
her
aunt
there
she
said
his
father
however
would
not
hear
of
it
and
dismissed
the
subject
very
shortly
by
saying
that
when
gjert
was
old
enough
he
intended
him
to
go
to
tergesen
in
vraangen
and
learn
to
rig
his
mother
could
not
however
so
easily
dismiss
the
ambitious
scheme
from
her
mind
and
it
became
a
few
days
after
the
occasion
of
the
most
violent
scene
which
had
ever
yet
put
her
strength
of
purpose
to
the
test
but
from
which
there
ensued
eventually
the
very
happiest
results
a
had
lately
come
up
to
arendal
from
a
cadet
cruise
to
the
mediterranean
and
gjert
had
been
allowed
to
go
over
with
one
of
the
other
pilots
to
see
her
apart
from
the
sensation
which
her
lofty
rig
the
shining
brass
stoppers
protruding
from
her
gunports
her
swarm
of
sailors
and
the
sound
of
the
shrill
whistle
and
occasional
beat
of
drum
on
board
suggestive
of
discipline
created
curiosity
had
been
further
excited
by
some
rumours
which
were
in
circulation
about
her
cruise
having
been
a
flogging
cruise
and
among
gjert
friends
and
indeed
among
the
harbour
people
generally
she
was
so
much
the
object
of
awe
that
whenever
the
whistle
sounded
it
would
darkly
suggest
the
thought
that
another
flogging
was
going
to
take
place
and
any
boats
that
were
near
at
the
moment
would
sheer
off
to
a
more
comfortable
distance
there
was
just
so
much
truth
in
all
this
that
there
was
one
very
officer
on
board
who
was
very
much
hated
by
the
crew
and
who
had
been
unfortunate
enough
to
single
out
for
flogging
just
the
man
whom
if
he
had
been
better
advised
he
would
have
left
alone
the
namely
of
the
ship
the
result
had
been
that
ever
since
a
mystic
refrain
sufficiently
significant
however
had
been
sung
at
the
capstan
and
had
found
its
way
on
shore
where
it
was
in
the
mouth
now
of
every
boy
about
the
harbour
gjert
curiosity
about
everything
connected
with
the
vessel
was
unbounded
and
frederick
beck
with
whom
he
had
established
a
close
friendship
since
that
little
affair
with
the
other
grandfather
when
gjert
had
saved
him
from
punishment
could
not
tell
him
half
enough
fancy
he
thought
to
be
able
to
go
about
in
a
uniform
all
covered
with
gold
like
the
officers
there
on
board
he
could
think
and
talk
of
nothing
else
all
the
time
they
were
sailing
home
next
day
the
wind
had
risen
to
half
a
gale
and
they
had
three
reefs
in
the
mainsail
his
father
who
for
some
days
past
had
been
wandering
with
increasing
frequency
up
to
the
or
down
to
the
quay
where
he
would
stand
with
his
hand
behind
his
back
alone
and
look
about
him
in
an
eager
restless
way
sure
signs
that
he
was
getting
tired
of
being
on
land
had
been
up
several
times
to
look
out
for
the
boy
and
was
now
sitting
in
the
house
pasting
together
an
old
chart
as
his
son
came
up
from
the
quay
shouting
out
the
new
song
at
the
top
of
his
voice
against
the
wind
he
stopped
in
the
porch
to
collect
his
breath
to
give
the
last
stanza
with
effect
and
husband
and
wife
as
they
listened
exchanged
glances
it
was
easy
to
see
when
he
came
in
that
he
was
bursting
with
the
consciousness
of
having
all
sorts
of
wonderful
things
to
relate
his
mother
had
just
laid
the
table
for
their
evening
meal
and
as
he
greeted
them
in
an
sort
of
way
he
drew
a
chair
over
to
the
table
at
the
same
time
that
he
might
be
ready
to
fall
to
the
moment
the
food
was
set
down
well
gjert
said
his
mother
after
he
had
sat
and
looked
round
him
for
a
moment
or
two
evidently
expecting
to
be
invited
to
gratify
their
curiosity
were
you
on
board
not
myself
but
i
talked
to
others
who
had
been
for
that
matter
i
saw
everything
that
was
to
be
seen
he
assured
them
with
a
nod
reaching
over
at
the
same
time
for
a
crust
of
bread
from
the
topmast
of
the
antonia
a
schooner
that
was
lying
close
alongside
she
barely
reached
up
to
the
eagle
bulwarks
she
would
just
about
make
a
for
her
if
she
was
a
good
deal
smaller
said
his
father
drily
completing
the
sentence
for
him
as
he
went
over
and
placed
the
chart
upon
the
top
of
the
small
cupboard
in
the
corner
gjert
began
then
addressing
himself
to
his
mother
to
support
his
assertion
by
a
comparison
of
the
height
out
of
the
water
of
the
schooner
hull
and
of
the
corvette
by
assuring
her
that
the
vane
at
her
had
not
reached
higher
than
the
mainyard
but
he
was
interrupted
by
his
father
what
song
was
that
you
were
singing
out
there
oh
it
was
the
one
about
the
flogging
cruise
it
really
was
one
then
said
the
pilot
with
a
searching
look
at
his
son
he
did
not
easily
give
credence
to
gossip
of
the
kind
to
be
addressed
by
his
father
in
this
interested
tone
was
highly
flattering
to
gjert
it
was
this
in
fact
that
he
had
been
eager
all
the
time
to
tell
them
about
and
he
burst
out
now
with
the
deepest
conviction
in
his
manner
that
it
was
father
some
say
six
others
nine
but
that
they
were
all
flogged
within
an
inch
of
their
lives
and
put
in
irons
down
in
the
mediterranean
is
as
certain
as
as
he
looked
about
him
eagerly
here
for
something
that
should
be
duly
emphatic
and
when
no
other
more
striking
illustration
suggested
itself
had
to
wind
up
finally
with
this
rather
lame
one
as
that
the
cuckoo
is
standing
up
there
on
the
clock
the
intelligence
had
the
effect
of
bringing
his
mother
to
a
seat
with
the
plate
on
her
lap
while
she
looked
apprehensively
from
her
son
to
her
husband
there
was
nothing
however
in
the
aspect
of
the
latter
to
justify
her
apprehension
who
did
you
hear
this
from
gjert
she
asked
who
did
i
hear
it
from
from
everybody
but
bethinking
him
then
that
in
his
incredulous
home
everybody
would
be
reckoned
about
as
valuable
an
authority
as
nobody
he
continued
from
frederick
beck
he
had
talked
himself
with
one
of
the
sailors
who
was
in
charge
of
the
officers
gig
down
by
the
while
his
chief
was
on
shore
and
that
was
all
he
heard
but
a
lot
of
other
queer
things
besides
here
he
looked
round
him
evidently
with
a
satisfied
feeling
that
he
must
have
convinced
them
this
time
at
any
rate
he
seems
to
have
been
a
credible
kind
of
a
chap
that
sailor
observed
his
father
with
a
mild
irony
which
escaped
his
son
however
while
his
mother
looked
at
him
in
some
anxiety
lest
he
should
be
going
to
sit
there
and
make
a
fool
of
himself
well
and
what
further
did
he
tell
him
oh
lots
of
things
let
us
have
them
he
said
they
had
had
such
a
hurricane
down
there
that
they
came
across
a
whole
town
that
had
been
blown
away
drifting
out
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
with
a
minister
praying
in
the
midst
of
it
then
that
they
had
run
so
close
in
to
the
land
in
beating
up
the
straits
of
gibraltar
that
they
had
taken
a
on
board
on
the
end
of
the
bowsprit
with
a
whole
family
of
negroes
sitting
in
it
whom
they
had
afterwards
to
put
ashore
gjert
would
have
delivered
himself
of
still
another
curious
incident
if
he
had
not
been
brought
up
by
the
laughter
of
his
parents
the
bagman
too
was
laughing
because
he
saw
the
others
doing
so
and
received
a
crushing
look
accordingly
from
gjert
who
drew
in
his
horns
at
once
perhaps
you
do
think
it
true
do
you
know
what
it
is
to
spin
a
yarn
my
boy
that
lad
down
in
the
gig
has
been
spinning
you
a
fine
one
said
his
father
as
he
sat
down
to
the
table
gjert
continued
to
talk
all
through
the
meal
and
when
it
was
over
while
his
mother
came
in
and
out
of
the
room
and
his
father
sat
over
at
the
window
partly
listening
and
partly
looking
out
at
the
weather
he
described
everything
he
had
seen
with
such
life
and
vividness
particularly
all
that
concerned
the
officers
and
the
cadets
that
his
mother
sat
down
to
listen
and
his
father
when
there
was
a
pause
observed
with
a
quiet
laugh
i
daresay
you
would
have
liked
to
have
been
one
of
the
cadets
yourself
gjert
yes
said
his
mother
beguiled
for
a
moment
by
the
dazzling
thought
if
he
were
only
to
go
to
school
in
arendal
no
one
knows
what
might
happen
the
clerk
says
that
nothing
is
any
trouble
to
gjert
something
in
this
observation
must
have
struck
discordantly
upon
her
husband
ear
for
he
changed
colour
and
replied
shortly
after
somewhat
sarcastically
it
my
opinion
that
gjert
is
not
too
good
for
his
father
station
and
that
we
are
not
going
to
make
interest
with
anybody
to
hoist
him
up
into
the
company
of
his
betters
as
they
call
themselves
gjert
previous
animation
had
been
very
much
heightened
by
the
picture
which
such
a
glittering
prospect
presented
to
his
fancy
and
he
cried
now
without
taking
warning
by
his
father
changed
tone
mother
was
saying
though
the
other
day
that
if
i
were
to
be
a
cadet
i
should
cut
a
better
figure
in
the
world
than
as
an
ordinary
common
sailor
it
was
as
if
a
match
had
been
thrown
into
a
his
father
hard
face
flushed
up
wildly
and
he
threw
over
at
his
wife
a
look
of
inexpressible
cold
scorn
turning
savagely
away
he
said
in
a
cutting
tone
that
seemed
to
go
through
her
do
you
also
despise
your
father
station
my
boy
when
gjert
blundered
out
then
in
his
eagerness
frederick
beck
is
going
to
be
a
cadet
it
was
followed
simply
by
come
here
gjert
and
he
received
a
blow
that
sent
him
staggering
against
the
table
a
second
was
about
to
follow
when
his
father
happened
to
look
up
at
his
wife
she
had
sprung
a
couple
of
steps
forward
as
if
to
take
gjert
from
him
and
was
standing
now
before
him
with
crimson
face
and
flashing
eyes
and
with
a
bearing
that
made
him
at
all
events
lower
his
hand
she
then
turned
away
at
once
and
went
out
into
the
kitchen
salvé
stood
for
a
moment
uncertain
how
to
act
then
he
went
to
the
kitchen
door
and
announced
shortly
and
sharply
that
he
and
gjert
were
going
to
sea
that
evening
they
would
want
provisions
the
wind
and
rain
beat
wildly
against
the
black
while
elizabeth
was
carrying
out
his
orders
but
when
she
presently
came
in
with
the
and
what
else
they
were
to
take
with
them
not
a
trace
of
anxiety
or
of
her
former
emotion
was
to
be
detected
her
face
was
pale
and
and
there
was
something
almost
humble
in
her
bearing
towards
her
husband
but
when
for
a
moment
she
and
gjert
were
left
alone
together
in
the
house
drawing
him
hastily
towards
her
she
whispered
in
a
voice
choked
with
repressed
emotion
never
let
your
father
see
that
you
are
afraid
my
boy
she
bade
her
husband
farewell
at
the
door
and
there
was
foul
weather
both
within
and
without
the
pilot
as
he
put
to
sea
that
evening
chapter
xxvii
elizabeth
was
more
agitated
even
than
usual
after
a
scene
of
this
kind
when
he
had
struck
her
son
her
indignation
had
almost
mastered
her
and
it
frightened
her
now
to
think
how
near
she
had
been
to
an
explosion
this
time
the
excuses
which
she
had
accustomed
herself
to
make
for
him
would
not
suggest
themselves
and
as
she
lay
awake
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
and
looked
back
through
the
years
that
were
gone
it
seemed
as
if
she
was
struggling
and
labouring
on
for
ever
without
any
prospect
of
getting
nearer
to
the
goal
and
that
her
patience
was
wellnigh
exhausted
had
she
no
claim
at
all
to
consideration
or
must
she
be
for
ever
silent
like
this
till
one
of
them
should
at
last
be
laid
in
tromö
churchyard
these
thoughts
having
been
once
roused
would
not
be
repressed
again
they
held
possession
of
her
during
the
following
day
too
and
she
could
settle
down
to
no
work
of
any
kind
she
dreaded
that
salvé
might
unexpectedly
return
and
did
not
know
how
she
should
receive
him
she
no
longer
felt
sure
of
being
able
to
control
herself
her
own
house
had
all
of
a
sudden
become
confined
and
suffocating
as
if
it
were
a
prison
in
which
she
had
sat
for
years
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
bear
this
way
of
living
no
longer
on
one
of
the
following
days
a
neighbour
came
in
with
a
message
from
her
aunt
she
was
ill
and
wished
elizabeth
to
come
and
see
her
leaving
word
accordingly
for
salvé
when
he
returned
where
she
was
gone
she
took
henrik
with
her
and
set
out
at
once
for
arendal
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
think
that
she
would
be
away
this
time
when
he
came
home
that
old
mother
kirstine
should
be
laid
up
was
in
its
way
an
event
in
the
place
having
been
professed
for
so
many
years
she
was
connected
by
ties
of
grateful
recollection
with
a
number
of
families
men
who
were
now
fathers
themselves
remembered
well
her
face
bending
over
them
when
as
children
they
had
tossed
about
in
measles
or
fever
and
when
any
more
serious
illness
now
occurred
in
any
of
their
households
she
appeared
upon
the
scene
as
a
matter
of
course
without
waiting
to
be
sent
for
and
it
was
a
comfort
in
itself
to
see
that
strong
old
woman
with
her
quiet
experienced
tact
and
untiring
faculty
of
keeping
awake
moving
about
the
and
giving
her
directions
with
a
confidence
that
brooked
no
contradiction
her
position
in
fact
was
such
that
when
a
new
doctor
arrived
he
soon
perceived
that
the
first
thing
he
had
to
do
if
he
was
to
have
any
reputation
in
the
town
would
be
to
win
the
confidence
of
old
mother
kirstine
young
fru
beck
amongst
others
had
constantly
sent
to
inquire
after
her
and
when
she
heard
that
elizabeth
was
there
she
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
of
going
to
see
her
it
was
one
evening
before
dinner
mother
kirstine
had
fallen
into
a
quiet
sleep
and
elizabeth
was
sitting
by
her
bedside
when
she
saw
fru
beck
pass
the
window
elizabeth
knew
she
would
come
in
and
sat
with
beating
heart
waiting
for
her
knock
at
the
door
fru
beck
must
have
stood
a
long
while
in
the
porch
for
some
minutes
passed
before
the
latch
was
stirred
elizabeth
went
softly
out
and
opened
the
door
they
stood
face
to
face
elizabeth
eyes
were
full
of
tears
but
fru
beck
feelings
were
not
at
that
moment
so
easily
expressed
she
silently
pressed
elizabeth
hand
and
her
manner
and
the
expression
of
her
pale
face
showed
that
she
was
not
the
less
moved
of
the
two
at
their
meeting
again
elizabeth
showed
her
into
mother
kirstine
comfortable
little
kitchen
where
a
saucepan
of
broth
for
her
sick
aunt
was
simmering
over
the
fire
she
invited
her
visitor
to
take
a
seat
it
was
so
quiet
that
they
could
hear
the
watch
ticking
in
the
next
room
where
her
aunt
was
sleeping
neither
spoke
for
a
moment
or
two
then
fru
beck
asked
in
a
low
voice
how
is
your
aunt
elizabeth
it
was
a
natural
question
to
ask
under
the
circumstances
but
it
was
felt
by
both
to
be
only
a
preliminary
breaking
of
the
ice
she
had
besides
sent
a
messenger
that
morning
already
to
make
inquiries
thank
you
fru
beck
she
is
improving
elizabeth
replied
she
is
asleep
now
and
that
will
do
her
good
it
is
a
long
time
since
we
saw
each
other
nearly
eighteen
years
said
fru
beck
and
her
eyes
dwelt
upon
elizabeth
as
if
to
find
what
traces
time
had
left
upon
her
but
you
have
kept
strong
i
see
stronger
than
i
have
it
was
that
morning
i
left
for
holland
said
elizabeth
seeming
to
recall
it
with
a
certain
pleasure
i
have
often
thought
of
that
time
whispered
fru
beck
more
to
herself
almost
than
to
the
person
she
was
talking
to
her
lip
trembled
slightly
and
elizabeth
read
an
expression
of
mute
sorrow
in
her
face
she
was
on
the
point
of
telling
elizabeth
that
she
knew
the
reason
of
her
going
but
after
debating
for
a
moment
within
herself
whether
she
should
or
not
finally
let
it
pass
ah
if
we
could
only
see
into
the
future
elizabeth
she
exclaimed
with
a
sigh
and
looked
sadly
at
her
as
if
she
thought
she
had
given
expression
to
a
feeling
that
must
be
common
to
them
both
it
is
better
as
it
is
fru
beck
many
things
happen
in
life
that
would
not
be
so
easy
to
bear
if
we
were
cast
down
beforehand
yes
but
one
could
guard
one
self
whispered
fru
beck
with
a
certain
bitterness
and
hardness
in
her
voice
elizabeth
made
no
reply
and
there
was
a
pause
which
seemed
to
fru
beck
to
have
broken
the
thread
of
the
conversation
she
deliberated
how
she
should
take
it
up
again
so
as
to
get
at
what
she
wanted
to
say
and
taking
elizabeth
hand
with
sudden
warmth
she
said
if
there
is
anything
your
aunt
wants
you
know
i
hope
that
she
has
only
to
send
to
me
she
would
rather
have
made
elizabeth
herself
the
object
of
her
interest
instead
of
her
aunt
but
felt
that
there
was
much
in
the
relations
in
which
they
had
stood
to
one
another
to
make
that
impossible
but
her
meaning
was
just
as
clear
and
for
yourself
elizabeth
she
went
on
looking
searchingly
into
her
eyes
with
an
expression
of
deep
sympathy
all
is
not
right
with
you
i
am
afraid
your
marriage
has
not
been
a
happy
one
these
last
words
brought
a
sudden
flush
into
elizabeth
face
and
she
involuntarily
withdrew
her
hand
she
looked
at
fru
beck
with
an
expression
of
wounded
pride
as
if
it
was
a
subject
she
declined
to
discuss
that
is
not
the
case
fru
beck
she
replied
i
am
she
was
going
to
say
happily
but
preferred
to
say
not
unhappily
married
she
felt
that
that
sounded
rather
weak
and
added
i
have
never
loved
never
wished
for
any
one
but
him
who
is
now
my
husband
i
am
overjoyed
to
hear
it
elizabeth
for
i
had
heard
otherwise
said
fru
beck
with
some
embarrassment
and
there
was
another
pause
she
felt
from
elizabeth
manner
and
bearing
that
she
had
wounded
her
and
this
last
unlucky
speech
she
was
afraid
had
made
matters
worse
there
was
a
movement
in
the
adjoining
room
and
elizabeth
was
glad
of
an
occasion
to
break
the
rather
painful
silence
and
went
in
to
her
aunt
for
a
moment
fru
beck
looked
after
her
with
a
rather
surprised
but
an
unsatisfied
expression
she
must
have
been
mistaken
but
still
happy
in
her
home
elizabeth
could
scarcely
be
and
yet
she
thought
bitterly
what
a
gulf
there
was
between
them
she
at
all
events
loved
her
husband
when
elizabeth
returned
fru
beck
with
the
idea
of
effacing
the
impression
she
had
already
produced
and
to
satisfy
at
the
same
time
her
own
longing
to
open
her
heart
to
somebody
said
you
must
not
be
offended
at
what
i
said
elizabeth
i
thought
that
others
might
have
sorrow
too
we
all
have
our
burden
and
often
it
is
very
hard
to
bear
rejoined
elizabeth
she
understood
very
well
what
fru
beck
words
had
meant
and
looked
at
her
compassionately
but
she
avoided
answering
directly
to
what
she
thought
had
been
blurted
out
unintentionally
and
said
you
have
a
son
that
should
be
a
great
happiness
fru
beck
and
much
to
live
for
to
live
for
she
exclaimed
to
live
for
i
will
confide
to
you
something
that
no
one
but
you
now
knows
i
am
dying
dying
every
day
no
one
knows
as
well
as
i
do
myself
how
much
is
left
of
me
it
is
little
and
it
will
soon
be
less
she
spoke
in
a
cold
pale
kind
of
ecstasy
you
are
the
only
creature
i
have
told
this
to
the
only
one
on
this
earth
i
really
care
about
hear
it
and
forget
it
and
now
adieu
she
said
if
we
ever
meet
again
in
this
world
do
let
the
subject
be
mentioned
between
us
she
felt
blindly
for
the
door
and
opened
it
every
cross
comes
from
above
and
the
worst
of
all
sins
is
to
despair
said
elizabeth
with
an
attempt
at
consolation
she
said
what
most
readily
occurred
to
her
at
the
moment
fru
beck
turned
at
the
door
and
looked
back
at
her
with
a
white
calm
joyless
face
elizabeth
she
said
i
found
this
in
one
of
my
husband
drawers
i
tell
it
you
that
you
may
not
think
that
that
has
been
in
any
way
the
cause
of
my
spoilt
life
she
took
from
her
pocket
a
scrap
of
paper
yellow
with
age
and
handed
it
to
her
the
door
closed
behind
her
then
and
she
was
gone
elizabeth
sat
still
for
a
long
while
in
sad
distress
thinking
of
her
now
she
understood
why
fru
beck
was
so
pale
she
had
not
a
wrinkle
in
her
face
it
looked
so
noble
but
oh
how
cold
how
pinched
it
had
become
poor
poor
woman
her
burden
was
indeed
a
heavy
one
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
recognise
marie
forstberg
again
in
her
that
then
it
is
to
have
married
unhappily
she
said
to
herself
she
seemed
to
have
gazed
into
some
terrible
abyss
her
friend
sorrows
continued
to
occupy
her
thoughts
as
she
sat
by
her
aunt
bedside
and
when
at
last
her
feelings
of
compassion
had
calmed
down
another
point
in
their
conversation
that
had
been
hitherto
thrown
into
the
background
came
into
increasing
prominence
it
lay
in
the
words
that
had
so
suddenly
and
grievously
wounded
her
so
that
is
what
the
world
says
of
us
she
thought
that
our
marriage
has
been
unhappy
she
had
time
and
solitude
enough
while
tending
her
patient
and
sitting
up
with
her
to
ponder
the
matter
and
as
she
thought
over
her
married
life
and
contemplated
unflinchingly
the
constant
weary
fruitless
struggle
in
which
it
had
passed
and
in
which
she
had
not
advanced
one
single
step
but
rather
had
been
going
always
always
back
more
and
more
she
asked
herself
could
she
say
that
there
was
happiness
in
a
life
like
that
and
was
salvé
himself
happy
she
saw
him
before
her
as
he
was
in
his
early
youth
and
as
he
was
now
gloomy
savage
and
suspicious
in
his
home
she
thought
how
she
welcomed
him
always
with
disguised
dread
instead
of
with
a
wife
joy
how
they
had
last
parted
and
what
feelings
she
had
since
entertained
and
she
dwelt
long
and
bitterly
upon
the
contrast
to
think
that
it
should
have
come
to
this
between
them
she
began
with
dread
to
reflect
perhaps
this
is
what
they
mean
by
an
unhappy
marriage
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
before
that
such
a
thing
could
be
said
of
her
of
her
who
had
married
the
man
whom
of
all
others
in
the
whole
world
she
wished
to
marry
she
sat
on
far
into
the
night
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
knee
and
gazing
straight
before
her
the
from
the
glass
behind
the
bed
throwing
its
faint
light
over
the
room
fru
beck
words
as
she
stood
there
so
pale
and
told
her
of
her
unhappiness
recurred
to
her
again
and
again
more
distinctly
it
seemed
each
time
i
am
dying
every
day
i
know
best
myself
how
much
is
left
of
me
it
is
very
little
and
will
soon
be
less
it
seemed
then
all
in
a
moment
to
flash
upon
her
that
is
just
how
salvé
and
i
are
living
we
are
wasting
away
we
are
dying
every
day
beside
each
other
that
is
what
people
do
who
are
unhappily
married
she
sat
for
a
long
while
with
her
head
bent
forward
sorrowfully
engrossed
with
this
thought
in
all
the
she
had
practised
because
she
thought
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
the
truth
she
saw
now
nothing
but
one
long
corroding
lie
it
was
owing
to
the
want
of
confidence
in
each
other
of
mutual
candour
to
their
both
having
shunned
the
truth
the
only
sure
ground
of
happiness
that
their
life
together
had
been
thus
spoilt
she
threw
back
her
head
with
a
look
of
wild
energy
in
her
face
and
never
had
she
looked
more
handsome
than
now
as
she
exclaimed
decisively
but
there
shall
be
an
end
of
this
salvé
and
i
shall
no
longer
make
a
desert
of
each
other
life
and
she
rose
from
her
chair
in
great
agitation
what
are
you
saying
elizabeth
asked
her
aunt
whom
she
had
unconsciously
awakened
nothing
dear
aunt
she
answered
and
bent
over
the
invalid
with
a
cup
of
broth
which
she
had
been
keeping
warm
over
the
you
look
so
so
happy
elizabeth
it
is
because
you
have
slept
so
well
aunt
and
if
you
drink
this
you
will
go
to
sleep
again
there
was
a
quiet
smile
on
her
lips
now
and
her
whole
bearing
was
changed
the
burden
of
years
was
taken
off
her
heart
at
last
the
chilling
heavy
bewildering
fog
which
had
enclosed
her
whole
life
making
every
footstep
every
thought
every
joy
uncertain
had
lifted
and
she
could
clearly
see
her
way
chapter
xxviii
salvé
had
been
lucky
he
had
piloted
an
english
bark
into
hesnaes
and
his
services
had
been
liberally
acknowledged
he
had
as
usual
looked
forward
with
dread
to
coming
home
again
but
when
he
found
his
wife
not
there
and
heard
the
reason
he
had
set
off
at
once
for
arendal
to
see
after
her
she
received
him
out
in
the
passage
good
morning
salvé
she
said
shaking
hands
with
him
i
have
been
anxious
about
you
as
you
may
suppose
and
have
been
expecting
you
you
must
make
a
noise
come
this
way
and
she
showed
him
into
the
room
at
the
side
where
is
gjert
he
looked
at
her
in
surprise
this
was
not
her
usual
way
of
receiving
him
there
was
a
confidence
in
her
tone
as
if
she
had
taken
upon
herself
to
call
him
to
account
for
his
absence
it
had
hitherto
been
he
always
who
had
taken
the
initiative
and
been
in
a
gracious
humour
or
not
according
as
it
pleased
him
gjert
he
answered
rather
shortly
is
at
home
in
the
house
so
you
have
been
anxious
about
me
expected
me
he
added
in
a
peculiar
tone
as
if
he
found
something
to
remark
upon
in
this
way
of
addressing
him
but
deferred
comment
for
the
present
why
you
know
goodman
that
it
ca
be
the
same
to
me
if
you
are
lost
out
there
at
sea
how
is
your
aunt
he
asked
abruptly
is
she
seriously
ill
she
can
see
you
come
in
with
me
but
step
gently
salvé
felt
that
he
could
not
very
well
refuse
and
followed
her
he
had
always
as
far
as
possible
avoided
seeing
mother
kirstine
and
had
left
his
wife
to
represent
him
in
that
quarter
he
was
afraid
of
the
penetrating
eyes
which
the
old
woman
turned
upon
him
and
had
never
forgotten
the
warning
she
had
given
him
not
to
go
near
elizabeth
as
long
as
he
harboured
a
doubt
against
her
in
his
heart
it
was
with
great
deference
that
he
now
approached
her
bedside
oh
it
you
salvé
she
said
in
a
weak
voice
it
not
often
i
have
a
sight
of
you
elizabeth
has
been
such
a
blessing
to
me
and
henrik
is
so
quiet
and
good
where
is
gjert
have
you
not
brought
him
with
you
and
her
eyes
wandered
in
search
of
the
boy
he
is
at
home
taking
care
of
the
house
aunt
how
are
you
oh
thanks
as
you
see
i
think
so
often
what
will
become
of
that
boy
he
is
so
wild
but
with
such
a
good
nature
poor
fellow
oh
we
shall
make
something
of
him
you
see
said
elizabeth
who
had
been
standing
behind
salvé
and
now
came
forward
but
you
must
not
talk
so
much
salvé
face
grew
stern
this
was
the
most
unfortunate
topic
which
could
have
been
suggested
and
matters
were
presently
made
worse
by
mother
kirstine
saying
when
there
was
a
pause
you
looked
so
glad
last
night
elizabeth
who
was
it
that
was
sitting
with
you
talking
yesterday
it
was
fru
beck
the
young
one
yes
but
you
talk
too
much
aunt
i
am
afraid
so
too
thought
salvé
and
as
he
saw
elizabeth
as
if
nothing
had
happened
motioning
to
him
now
to
come
away
he
controlled
himself
for
the
moment
and
said
a
little
constrainedly
you
will
be
quite
well
aunt
i
hope
by
the
time
i
come
again
perhaps
in
a
few
days
till
then
he
left
the
room
rather
brusquely
and
his
face
was
black
as
thunder
elizabeth
read
his
thoughts
and
when
they
came
out
into
the
kitchen
she
forestalled
him
listen
salvé
she
said
i
must
of
course
stay
here
as
long
as
aunt
is
of
course
he
replied
and
you
have
acquaintances
here
you
mean
fru
beck
yes
she
has
been
so
kind
to
me
and
i
am
attached
to
her
she
is
unhappily
married
poor
thing
salvé
was
astounded
elizabeth
seemed
all
in
a
moment
to
have
forgotten
a
great
deal
to
have
forgotten
that
there
existed
certain
between
them
was
it
perhaps
because
she
was
in
her
aunt
house
he
looked
coldly
at
her
as
if
he
could
not
quite
comprehend
what
had
come
over
her
you
will
remain
of
course
as
long
as
you
please
he
said
and
prepared
to
go
but
could
not
help
adding
with
bitterness
i
daresay
you
find
it
lonely
and
dull
at
home
you
are
not
so
far
wrong
there
salvé
she
replied
i
have
indeed
found
it
lonely
enough
out
there
for
many
years
now
you
are
so
often
away
from
home
and
then
i
am
left
quite
alone
it
is
two
years
now
since
i
have
been
in
here
to
see
my
aunt
elizabeth
he
burst
out
trying
hard
to
restrain
himself
have
you
taken
leave
of
your
senses
that
is
just
what
i
want
to
avoid
salvé
she
said
with
freezing
deliberation
he
stared
at
her
she
could
stand
and
tell
him
this
to
his
face
so
these
are
your
sentiments
then
he
observed
scornfully
i
always
suspected
it
and
now
for
what
i
care
you
may
please
yourself
about
coming
home
elizabeth
he
continued
in
a
cold
indifferent
tone
you
ought
always
to
have
known
what
my
sentiments
were
salvé
that
i
was
perhaps
too
much
attached
to
you
i
shall
send
you
money
you
shall
not
have
that
as
an
excuse
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
you
may
enjoy
the
society
of
fru
beck
and
your
fine
friends
as
long
as
ever
you
please
and
why
should
i
not
be
allowed
to
speak
to
fru
beck
she
cried
with
her
head
thrown
back
and
with
an
expression
of
rising
anger
you
mean
i
suppose
that
there
is
anything
against
me
that
should
prevent
my
entering
her
house
but
there
must
be
an
end
to
this
salvé
and
it
is
for
the
sake
of
our
love
i
say
it
for
if
matters
go
on
as
they
have
been
going
on
so
long
between
us
she
concluded
slowly
and
with
a
tremor
in
her
voice
you
might
live
to
see
the
day
when
it
had
ceased
to
exist
these
things
are
not
in
our
own
power
salvé
he
stood
for
a
moment
still
and
gazed
at
her
in
speechless
amazement
while
the
flash
of
his
dark
keen
eyes
showed
that
a
devil
had
been
roused
within
him
which
he
had
the
utmost
difficulty
in
restraining
i
will
suppose
that
you
have
said
this
in
a
moment
of
excitement
he
said
with
terrible
calmness
i
shall
not
be
angry
with
you
i
shall
forget
it
i
promise
you
that
and
i
think
that
you
have
not
been
quite
yourself
ill
do
deceive
yourself
salvé
i
mean
every
word
as
surely
as
i
love
you
farewell
elizabeth
i
shall
be
here
again
on
wednesday
he
said
as
if
he
only
held
to
his
purpose
and
did
not
care
to
hear
any
more
of
this
he
left
her
then
and
shut
the
door
quietly
behind
him
when
he
had
gone
elizabeth
sank
rather
than
sat
down
upon
the
bench
she
was
frightened
at
what
she
had
said
a
profound
dread
took
possession
of
her
she
knew
his
nature
so
well
and
knew
that
she
was
risking
everything
that
the
result
might
be
that
he
would
leave
her
altogether
and
take
to
some
misguided
life
far
away
from
home
and
yet
it
must
it
must
be
dared
and
with
god
help
she
would
conquer
and
bind
him
to
her
closer
than
ever
he
had
been
before
chapter
xxix
as
salvé
stood
and
steered
for
home
he
had
as
yet
only
a
dull
consciousness
of
what
had
occurred
but
there
was
anger
in
his
eye
and
a
hard
determined
look
in
his
face
his
pride
had
received
a
terrible
shock
she
had
suddenly
fallen
upon
him
with
all
this
on
neutral
ground
she
had
told
him
plainly
that
she
had
been
unhappy
and
that
she
felt
she
had
been
living
under
a
tyranny
the
whole
time
of
their
married
life
he
smiled
bitterly
well
he
had
been
right
it
seemed
all
along
in
feeling
that
she
was
not
open
with
him
yes
it
was
true
that
they
had
lived
unhappily
but
whose
fault
had
it
been
had
she
not
deceived
him
when
he
was
young
and
confiding
and
did
not
know
what
doubt
was
and
since
he
knew
but
too
well
what
it
had
cost
her
to
adapt
herself
to
his
humble
circumstances
he
felt
that
the
power
which
he
had
had
over
her
for
so
many
years
was
gone
it
was
as
if
she
had
all
of
a
sudden
set
down
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
on
the
floor
of
his
house
and
threatened
to
blow
it
up
such
threats
however
would
have
no
weight
with
him
when
he
came
to
merdö
he
moored
the
cutter
in
silence
scarcely
looking
at
gjert
who
came
down
to
help
him
and
went
in
without
speaking
to
the
house
where
he
stood
by
the
window
for
a
while
writing
on
the
it
was
soon
quite
dark
outside
gjert
had
lit
a
candle
and
had
sat
down
by
the
table
he
understood
that
there
was
something
wrong
again
with
his
mother
but
did
not
dare
to
ask
after
her
as
he
was
longing
to
do
his
father
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
never
stirred
from
the
corner
of
the
bench
which
was
his
son
it
was
made
to
serve
the
double
purpose
of
bench
and
bed
when
arrived
gjert
put
some
food
on
the
table
he
felt
that
the
situation
somehow
was
dangerous
and
went
on
his
tiptoes
to
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
but
he
was
the
more
awkward
in
consequence
and
made
a
clatter
with
the
plates
this
and
the
dread
of
him
which
his
son
showed
irritated
salvé
he
flared
up
suddenly
and
burst
out
in
a
thundering
voice
do
you
ask
after
your
mother
boy
gjert
would
have
been
frightened
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
his
anxiety
for
his
mother
for
whom
his
heart
bled
gave
him
courage
to
answer
boldly
yes
father
i
have
been
wanting
all
the
time
to
ask
how
mother
was
is
she
not
coming
poor
mother
and
the
boy
burst
into
tears
laid
his
head
upon
his
arm
and
sobbed
mother
will
come
back
when
her
aunt
over
in
arendal
is
well
again
said
the
pilot
soothingly
but
he
soon
broke
out
again
you
have
nothing
to
blubber
for
he
said
you
can
go
in
and
see
her
if
you
like
morning
the
first
thing
you
may
go
now
and
sleep
in
our
bed
gjert
obeyed
and
his
father
paced
to
and
fro
on
the
floor
afterwards
for
a
long
while
in
great
agitation
that
is
her
game
then
is
it
he
exclaimed
she
knew
what
she
was
about
and
she
knew
who
it
was
she
was
threatening
he
sat
down
again
on
the
with
clasped
hands
and
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
passion
was
working
strongly
within
him
but
she
does
not
put
compulsion
upon
me
the
candle
was
expiring
in
the
socket
and
he
lit
another
and
put
it
in
its
place
it
was
past
midnight
he
remained
for
a
little
with
the
candlestick
in
his
hand
and
then
took
the
light
in
to
gjert
the
boy
was
lying
in
his
mother
place
and
had
evidently
cried
himself
to
sleep
his
father
stood
for
a
long
while
over
him
his
lips
quivered
and
his
face
became
ashy
pale
he
controlled
himself
with
an
effort
and
went
back
to
the
other
room
where
he
sat
down
in
the
same
attitude
as
before
when
gjert
came
in
in
the
morning
he
found
his
father
lying
down
on
the
bench
with
all
his
clothes
on
he
was
asleep
it
was
evident
that
he
had
sat
up
the
whole
night
it
went
to
the
boy
heart
and
he
felt
sorry
for
his
father
now
the
latter
woke
shortly
after
and
looked
at
him
rather
confusedly
at
first
then
he
said
gently
i
promised
you
yesterday
my
boy
that
you
should
go
to
your
mother
in
arendal
i
daresay
she
is
wanting
to
see
you
if
mother
is
not
ill
i
had
rather
stay
here
with
you
father
until
you
go
in
to
see
her
yourself
she
has
henrik
with
her
you
would
said
his
father
in
a
rather
toneless
voice
and
looking
at
him
as
if
some
new
idea
had
been
suggested
to
him
by
the
boy
reply
but
i
wish
you
to
go
gjert
he
said
then
suddenly
in
a
changed
tone
that
admitted
of
no
further
question
mother
took
no
things
with
her
you
must
take
her
sunday
gown
and
what
else
you
know
she
will
want
in
with
you
in
the
trunk
there
it
may
be
a
long
while
before
before
aunt
is
well
he
said
and
left
the
house
while
gjert
packed
up
the
things
his
father
went
down
to
the
strand
and
got
the
ready
himself
for
him
when
the
boy
started
he
stroked
the
child
cheek
but
said
a
little
bitterly
remember
me
to
your
mother
now
and
say
that
father
is
coming
as
he
promised
on
wednesday
be
careful
now
how
you
go
i
have
only
given
you
the
oars
i
do
like
to
trust
you
with
a
sail
in
the
boat
he
stood
for
some
time
looking
after
his
son
as
he
rowed
sturdily
away
and
then
went
up
to
the
where
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
in
his
usual
manner
his
restlessness
of
mind
however
soon
drove
him
back
again
to
the
house
where
he
remained
alone
nearly
the
whole
day
the
first
intensity
of
his
anger
had
so
far
worked
itself
off
now
that
he
could
think
clearly
and
the
chief
feeling
which
possessed
him
was
one
of
wonder
as
to
what
could
have
come
over
her
all
of
a
sudden
like
this
it
could
hardly
be
that
scene
which
they
had
had
when
he
last
went
to
sea
it
had
not
been
the
first
of
its
kind
no
it
must
be
something
else
it
must
have
been
something
which
had
occurred
in
arendal
she
had
spoken
of
fru
beck
unhappy
married
life
with
a
certain
significance
as
if
it
bore
upon
their
own
that
was
evidently
it
she
had
been
talking
to
fru
beck
she
must
have
been
put
up
to
it
by
her
old
friend
what
gratitude
i
do
owe
these
becks
he
exclaimed
it
seems
as
if
every
trouble
must
come
from
that
owl
nest
she
has
gone
and
thought
all
this
at
home
here
concealing
it
from
me
the
whole
time
submitting
and
saying
nothing
now
she
has
found
her
opportunity
and
over
there
in
arendal
she
could
of
course
count
upon
being
able
to
make
her
own
terms
against
her
husband
the
unpopular
pilot
could
be
sure
of
having
every
one
on
her
side
from
her
aunt
to
these
same
becks
yes
and
what
was
the
real
history
of
her
connection
with
the
becks
he
had
never
had
that
matter
satisfactorily
cleared
up
she
stipulated
that
i
should
trust
her
would
hear
mention
of
a
doubt
but
i
have
never
felt
satisfied
about
that
business
i
not
be
fooled
by
you
any
longer
he
cried
then
flying
into
a
sudden
passion
and
striding
up
and
down
the
room
it
is
she
who
must
give
me
an
explanation
it
is
she
who
has
trampled
me
under
foot
he
sat
down
at
the
table
and
pursued
this
train
of
thought
elizabeth
elizabeth
what
have
you
done
he
whispered
presently
with
emotion
and
hid
his
forehead
in
his
hands
yes
what
has
she
done
nothing
i
firmly
believe
and
that
it
is
just
you
salvé
who
are
mad
ah
if
i
could
only
really
believe
that
there
was
nothing
to
quarrel
about
after
all
and
i
can
believe
it
if
i
have
only
been
with
her
for
a
while
he
sighed
and
then
added
with
a
touch
of
the
fact
is
i
ought
never
to
go
away
from
home
i
am
like
an
anchovy
i
do
bear
taking
out
of
the
jar
she
was
so
like
the
old
elizabeth
as
she
stood
there
and
told
me
all
this
it
is
years
since
i
have
seen
her
like
that
there
not
her
match
to
be
found
the
whole
world
through
she
has
told
me
so
often
that
she
cares
for
me
has
always
cared
for
me
ever
since
the
time
she
was
living
with
her
grandfather
out
on
the
rock
and
an
untruth
never
came
from
her
lips
i
stake
my
life
upon
that
for
truth
i
believe
you
elizabeth
when
you
stand
like
that
and
tell
me
so
and
he
struck
the
table
as
if
he
was
making
the
declaration
to
her
face
but
why
should
she
care
for
me
he
went
on
have
her
thoughts
not
been
running
always
on
things
much
beyond
what
i
a
poor
pilot
and
my
humble
cottage
can
give
her
has
she
not
always
been
hankering
after
something
grand
during
these
days
while
this
conflict
of
thought
was
surging
to
and
fro
within
him
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
man
distraught
and
if
he
ever
left
the
house
he
could
not
rest
until
he
had
returned
to
it
again
the
prolonged
agitation
of
mind
had
told
upon
him
and
he
was
sitting
now
the
day
before
the
one
when
he
was
to
go
in
to
arendal
again
alone
in
his
house
feeling
very
low
and
depressed
it
looked
so
dreary
and
empty
over
in
the
window
by
the
where
she
generally
sat
to
sew
stood
the
polished
which
he
had
brought
long
ago
as
a
curiosity
from
monte
video
and
had
since
had
made
into
a
weight
for
her
and
by
the
wall
under
the
old
print
of
the
naiad
was
the
elephant
carved
out
of
bone
which
he
had
also
had
from
the
time
when
he
was
roaming
through
the
world
as
a
sailor
before
the
mast
he
gazed
at
these
things
for
a
while
absently
and
then
went
in
to
their
bedroom
there
was
the
chest
of
drawers
by
the
wall
on
which
she
always
placed
the
lacquered
glass
which
hung
in
the
other
room
when
she
arranged
her
beautiful
hair
how
many
a
conversation
they
had
had
together
as
she
stood
there
with
her
back
to
him
and
what
a
figure
she
had
often
answering
him
with
merely
a
change
of
expression
as
she
looked
back
at
him
over
her
shoulder
everything
in
the
room
had
some
such
vivid
memory
to
suggest
and
as
he
sat
dismally
on
the
side
of
their
bed
adjoining
which
was
little
henrik
his
thoughts
were
occupied
with
many
a
trivial
recollection
of
the
kind
which
might
seem
almost
childish
in
a
man
of
his
age
and
character
and
of
such
a
stern
exterior
but
he
was
anything
but
stern
now
presently
his
eyes
ceased
to
wander
he
sat
perfectly
still
the
conviction
had
seized
him
that
he
could
not
possibly
do
without
her
and
as
he
looked
slowly
about
him
a
great
terror
seemed
to
be
taking
possession
of
him
he
imagined
that
she
was
really
gone
that
in
some
way
or
another
he
had
really
lost
her
and
that
everything
in
the
room
was
standing
just
as
she
had
left
it
and
as
it
would
stand
unmoved
undusted
for
ever
i
have
deserved
it
he
muttered
and
a
cold
perspiration
came
out
upon
his
forehead
have
i
treated
her
in
such
a
way
that
i
have
any
right
to
expect
her
to
care
for
me
is
it
not
just
my
own
folly
that
is
to
blame
she
was
right
more
than
right
i
have
behaved
shamefully
to
her
suspiciously
and
tyrannically
invariably
unceasingly
and
now
i
may
sit
here
long
enough
and
repent
it
to
no
purpose
she
would
not
be
what
she
is
if
she
tamely
submitted
to
such
treatment
he
dwelt
upon
this
last
thought
until
the
scales
seemed
to
drop
from
his
eyes
and
acknowledging
the
truth
at
last
he
broke
out
with
bitter
scorn
against
himself
the
fact
is
in
my
cursed
pride
i
have
never
been
able
to
bear
the
thought
that
she
might
have
been
better
off
that
i
was
not
good
enough
for
her
not
fit
for
her
that
is
what
has
been
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
and
as
i
would
not
acknowledge
that
i
have
insisted
always
to
myself
that
i
could
not
trust
her
do
i
really
believe
this
he
asked
himself
then
slowly
and
fell
into
thought
again
his
face
growing
darker
and
darker
every
minute
what
a
booby
fool
idiot
i
am
he
cried
with
a
scornful
laugh
no
it
is
she
who
has
been
false
and
untruthful
she
who
must
acknowledge
it
she
who
is
bound
to
give
me
once
for
all
full
explanation
yes
it
is
she
who
must
bend
and
then
she
may
have
some
claim
to
hear
from
me
what
i
too
may
have
to
reproach
myself
for
in
my
acts
or
bearing
towards
her
that
is
how
it
is
and
that
is
how
it
shall
be
a
hard
inexorable
look
overspread
his
face
as
he
said
this
but
for
a
moment
he
appeared
almost
moved
again
i
shall
speak
kindly
to
her
be
so
gentle
forget
everything
but
bend
she
shall
he
added
and
that
decision
was
evidently
final
chapter
xxx
that
evening
was
passed
by
elizabeth
in
a
terrible
struggle
with
herself
when
gjert
had
brought
her
clothes
she
had
turned
very
pale
and
had
felt
as
if
she
had
undertaken
what
she
would
not
have
strength
to
carry
through
and
now
that
the
decisive
moment
had
nearly
come
this
feeling
increased
almost
to
despair
they
had
all
gone
to
bed
in
the
house
it
was
so
quiet
about
her
and
a
feeling
came
over
her
such
as
she
had
experienced
that
time
on
the
apollo
as
she
sat
and
waited
whilst
they
approached
the
sandbanks
early
next
morning
the
crisis
would
inevitably
come
and
it
was
a
question
now
of
losing
more
than
the
brig
of
losing
all
they
jointly
possessed
on
earth
she
saw
a
long
dreary
stretching
away
beyond
this
time
it
was
she
who
was
at
the
helm
and
steering
a
desperate
course
to
save
her
love
a
solemn
look
came
over
her
face
the
prayer
for
seamen
in
danger
which
she
had
so
often
used
when
the
gusts
were
shaking
the
house
out
there
on
merdö
and
she
sat
waiting
for
him
in
her
solitary
home
came
into
her
head
now
the
prayer
that
god
might
save
him
from
a
sudden
death
a
sudden
death
if
he
really
had
been
lost
on
one
of
those
many
occasions
when
he
had
parted
from
her
with
bitterness
and
anger
in
his
heart
would
her
love
then
have
been
a
blessing
to
him
no
salvé
she
cried
you
shall
not
have
me
to
thank
for
such
a
life
in
your
last
hour
in
the
night
she
awoke
with
a
scream
she
had
dreamt
that
salvé
was
going
to
leave
her
for
ever
and
she
cried
frantically
after
him

chapter
xxxi
his
two
sons
were
waiting
for
him
when
the
pilot
came
up
to
the
jetty
next
morning
little
henrik
had
begun
to
shout
to
him
gleefully
while
he
was
still
some
way
off
but
gjert
was
quiet
he
had
seen
enough
to
feel
that
there
must
be
something
serious
the
matter
between
his
parents
and
he
was
depressed
good
morning
boys
said
their
father
kindly
how
is
your
aunt
better
replied
gjert
she
sleeps
in
the
daytime
too
added
the
bagman
triumphantly
he
had
discovered
that
this
was
what
was
required
to
make
her
well
again
he
then
threw
his
cap
down
on
the
stones
with
a
great
sailor
air
and
with
an
eager
o
ohoi
began
to
haul
in
the
which
his
father
had
thrown
while
gjert
paying
no
attention
whatever
to
his
brother
efforts
made
it
fast
to
the
that
good
lads
stay
here
now
both
of
you
by
the
boat
and
look
after
her
till
i
come
back
said
their
father
see
gjert
that
henrik
does
leave
the
quay
he
left
them
then
and
went
rapidly
up
the
street
elizabeth
was
standing
by
the
hearth
expecting
him
and
something
of
a
sunday
calm
seemed
to
have
come
over
her
as
she
stood
there
she
heard
him
out
in
the
passage
and
when
he
entered
a
rapid
flush
passed
over
her
fine
features
but
it
disappeared
again
immediately
and
she
stared
at
him
with
lips
forgetting
to
greet
him
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
conscious
in
her
bearing
which
did
not
escape
him
that
was
the
elizabeth
he
loved
he
came
to
the
point
at
once
and
looking
her
full
in
the
face
began
with
great
earnestness
elizabeth
i
have
a
serious
accusation
to
make
against
you
you
have
not
been
frank
towards
me
you
have
disguised
your
real
feelings
from
me
for
many
years
i
am
afraid
during
the
whole
time
we
have
lived
together
he
spoke
gently
and
as
though
he
had
no
desire
to
press
the
charge
but
merely
waited
to
hear
her
make
a
full
acknowledgment
before
he
forgave
her
she
stood
however
without
raising
her
eyes
from
the
ground
her
face
pale
and
her
bosom
heaving
and
yet
how
i
have
loved
you
elizabeth
more
dearly
than
my
life
he
added
she
still
remained
for
a
moment
silent
and
had
to
summon
all
her
courage
now
to
speak
at
last
she
said
in
a
rather
strained
voice
and
without
lifting
her
eyes
i
hear
you
say
it
salvé
but
i
have
been
thinking
a
good
deal
lately
you
have
been
thinking
elizabeth
he
repeated
what
have
you
been
thinking
and
his
expression
changed
in
a
moment
to
the
dark
stern
one
she
knew
so
well
he
had
made
his
advance
further
he
would
not
go
am
i
right
or
am
i
not
he
asked
sharply
no
salvé
you
are
not
right
she
replied
turning
to
him
now
with
a
look
that
seemed
fired
by
all
she
had
endured
you
are
not
right
it
is
yourself
and
yourself
only
you
have
loved
all
along
and
when
you
took
me
as
your
wife
you
merely
took
another
to
help
you
there
were
two
about
it
then
and
even
so
it
was
not
enough
no
no
she
cried
striking
out
her
hand
with
an
emphatic
gesture
in
the
bitterness
of
her
feeling
if
you
had
loved
me
as
i
have
loved
you
we
would
not
be
standing
before
one
another
as
we
are
this
day
he
was
taken
aback
for
a
moment
by
this
unexpected
outburst
but
replied
in
a
cold
hard
voice
while
his
eyes
never
moved
from
her
face
i
thank
you
elizabeth
for
having
at
last
told
me
your
thoughts
though
it
comes
a
little
late
you
see
i
was
right
when
i
said
that
you
had
not
been
frank
towards
me
i
have
not
been
frank
with
you
you
say
yes
that
is
true
she
rejoined
while
her
eye
met
his
unflinchingly
and
it
is
to
my
honour
i
have
submitted
to
be
an
object
of
suspicion
in
my
own
house
i
have
shut
my
eyes
and
persisted
in
believing
that
you
cared
for
me
in
spite
of
the
heavier
burden
which
you
were
every
day
imposing
upon
me
in
spite
of
all
that
i
have
had
to
endure
and
it
has
been
much
very
much
salvé
and
i
have
done
all
this
because
i
believed
it
was
my
duty
and
because
i
thought
you
could
not
bear
to
hear
the
truth
and
because
i
hoped
that
i
might
conquer
in
the
end
and
make
you
really
love
me
as
i
have
all
along
and
but
too
well
loved
you
salvé
it
is
true
that
i
have
not
been
frank
with
you
and
i
repeat
it
is
to
my
honour
this
interpretation
of
their
relations
together
was
not
one
which
he
chose
to
accept
and
he
rejoined
in
the
same
hard
tone
as
before
however
cleverly
you
may
have
tried
to
conceal
it
elizabeth
it
has
always
been
but
too
evident
to
me
what
you
have
endured
in
trying
to
accommodate
yourself
to
the
humble
circumstances
of
a
man
like
me
i
know
as
well
as
you
that
a
common
seaman
was
little
suited
to
be
your
husband
i
have
always
known
it
from
the
time
we
were
first
engaged
when
we
stood
before
van
spyck
portrait
in
amsterdam
that
was
the
sort
of
man
i
knew
very
well
whom
you
ought
to
have
had
for
a
husband
i
saw
it
again
as
i
have
seen
it
always
when
you
made
comparisons
between
the
north
star
and
my
poor
brig
salvé
she
exclaimed
passionately
unable
to
control
herself
any
longer
what
rubbish
are
you
talking
do
you
not
know
perfectly
well
that
if
you
had
been
an
admiral
itself
you
never
would
have
been
greater
in
my
eyes
than
you
are
now
and
always
have
been
as
a
simple
pilot
and
pray
whom
was
i
thinking
of
when
i
was
looking
at
van
spyck
why
of
whom
but
of
you
thinking
that
the
man
called
salvé
kristiansen
who
stood
behind
me
was
just
the
one
to
have
done
what
van
spyck
did
or
when
i
was
admiring
the
north
star
was
i
not
thinking
then
too
if
you
salvé
were
in
command
of
her
they
would
see
what
she
could
really
do
with
a
proper
man
on
board
what
possible
interest
do
you
suppose
i
could
have
in
the
north
star
except
in
connection
with
you
were
not
you
poor
skipper
of
the
apollo
worth
more
a
thousand
times
more
to
me
than
a
hundred
north
stars
with
all
their
bravery
when
she
spoke
like
this
it
was
impossible
not
to
believe
every
single
word
of
what
she
said
and
salvé
expression
while
she
had
been
speaking
had
gradually
changed
to
one
of
inexpressible
happiness
so
it
was
really
he
and
he
alone
who
had
been
the
hero
of
her
life
and
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
her
as
though
like
alcibiades
of
old
he
would
end
the
discussion
by
clasping
her
to
his
heart
and
carrying
her
straight
off
with
him
to
his
home
but
he
was
arrested
by
the
deep
repelling
seriousness
with
which
she
continued
no
salvé
it
is
not
which
that
stands
between
us
however
ingeniously
you
may
have
discovered
it
it
is
not
that
it
is
something
else
it
is
that
you
do
trust
me
in
your
heart
that
is
the
truth
and
that
has
been
the
real
source
of
all
these
morbid
ideas
you
have
formed
and
look
you
she
went
on
with
wild
anguish
in
her
voice
we
shall
never
get
on
together
as
long
as
you
encourage
the
faintest
suspicion
of
such
thoughts
we
shall
never
have
peace
beside
our
hearth
that
peace
that
i
have
been
striving
for
all
these
years
when
i
have
been
submitting
as
i
did
to
everything
in
a
way
that
you
know
well
salvé
was
very
far
from
natural
to
me
and
as
she
said
this
she
looked
with
a
magnificent
air
at
him
and
if
you
can
not
yet
understand
that
may
god
help
you
and
us
she
ended
in
despair
and
turning
half
away
again
to
the
fire
stared
dejectedly
into
it
he
stood
before
her
form
as
if
he
had
been
paralysed
and
scarcely
dared
to
look
up
at
her
with
such
truth
had
all
that
she
had
said
come
home
to
him
she
had
held
a
mirror
up
to
their
life
together
and
he
saw
himself
in
it
so
utterly
selfish
and
so
small
by
the
side
of
all
this
love
he
was
profoundly
pained
and
humbled
and
was
too
naturally
truthful
to
wish
not
to
acknowledge
it
he
went
absently
to
the
window
and
stood
there
for
a
moment
elizabeth
he
said
then
despondently
turning
round
you
still
must
know
in
your
heart
that
you
have
been
everything
in
this
world
to
me
but
i
know
where
my
great
fault
to
you
has
been
and
i
tell
it
you
now
fully
and
freely
even
if
you
must
despise
me
for
it
yes
elizabeth
it
is
true
i
have
never
been
able
to
feel
absolutely
certain
that
i
had
full
possession
of
your
heart
though
god
be
praised
you
have
taught
me
differently
since
that
time
it
evidently
cost
him
a
struggle
to
go
on
with
the
humiliating
confession
since
that
business
between
you
and
the
lieutenant
that
has
been
the
thorn
in
my
flesh
he
said
gently
as
if
opening
his
inmost
heart
to
her
which
i
have
not
been
able
to
get
rid
of
in
spite
of
my
better
reason
and
i
do
know
but
what
it
may
still
be
there
there
lies
my
weakness
i
tell
it
you
plainly
and
honestly
but
at
the
same
time
i
ca
give
you
up
elizabeth
i
have
always
seen
he
continued
that
the
proper
husband
for
you
would
have
been
a
man
who
was
something
in
the
world
such
a
one
as
he
and
not
a
man
of
no
position
like
me
in
my
pride
i
never
could
bear
the
thought
and
it
is
that
that
has
made
me
so
full
of
rancour
against
all
the
world
and
so
suspicious
and
bad
towards
you
i
have
not
been
strong
enough
not
like
you
but
i
can
truly
say
i
have
struggled
with
my
weakness
elizabeth
he
said
pale
with
intensity
of
feeling
and
laying
both
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
looking
into
her
face
she
felt
that
his
arms
were
trembling
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
it
went
to
her
heart
to
see
him
like
this
all
at
once
on
a
sudden
thought
she
withdrew
herself
from
his
hands
and
went
into
the
little
room
adjoining
the
one
they
were
in
and
opened
a
drawer
there
she
came
out
with
the
old
note
in
her
hand
and
held
it
out
to
him
that
is
the
letter
i
wrote
to
the
lieutenant
the
night
i
left
the
becks
he
looked
at
her
a
little
wonderingly
fru
beck
gave
it
to
me
she
said
read
it
salvé
he
looked
at
the
large
clumsy
writing
and
spelt
out
forgive
me
that
i
can
not
be
your
wife
for
my
heart
is
given
to
elizabeth
raklev
he
sat
down
on
the
bench
and
read
it
over
again
while
she
bent
over
him
looking
now
at
the
writing
and
now
at
his
face
what
do
you
find
there
salvé
she
asked
why
could
i
not
be
wife
my
heart
is
given
to
another
he
answered
slowly
and
looking
up
at
her
with
moistened
eyes
not
yours
it
is
i
who
loved
another
and
who
was
that
other
god
bless
you
it
was
me
he
said
and
drew
her
down
upon
his
knee
into
a
long
long
embrace
the
boys
had
become
tired
of
waiting
down
at
the
boat
the
bagman
especially
since
it
was
clearly
past
the
bell
had
rung
over
at
the
and
the
town
boys
had
already
passed
from
school
his
white
head
and
heated
face
appeared
now
at
the
and
with
scarcely
a
glance
over
to
where
his
father
and
mother
were
sitting
on
the
bench
together
looking
very
happy
he
turned
at
once
to
the
hearth
and
became
aware
of
the
sad
fact
that
there
was
positively
no
porridge
to
be
seen
there
was
not
even
a
fire
coming
bodily
into
the
room
he
asked
with
tears
in
his
voice
have
you
had
dinner
are
gjert
and
i
not
to
have
any
then
his
mother
sprang
up
and
aunt
she
exclaimed
i
declare
it
is
one
and
no
dinner
put
down
henrik
was
glad
to
find
that
the
worst
danger
was
over
mother
kirstine
had
conjectured
that
there
must
be
something
particular
going
on
between
the
pair
in
the
kitchen
and
that
was
the
reason
she
had
not
called
elizabeth
when
the
latter
now
came
in
she
looked
at
her
inquiringly
and
asked
if
anything
had
happened
the
happiest
thing
of
my
whole
life
aunt
said
elizabeth
coming
over
to
the
bed
and
embracing
her
impetuously
she
hurried
back
then
to
her
business
in
the
kitchen
the
old
woman
looked
after
her
and
nodded
her
head
a
couple
of
times
slowly
thoughtfully
no
so
he
is
joking
with
little
henrik
she
said
then
to
herself
that
is
wonderful
i
have
never
heard
him
laugh
before
when
they
went
to
dinner
in
the
kitchen
salvé
left
them
he
was
not
hungry
and
came
in
to
her
he
had
a
great
deal
to
say
and
was
a
long
while
away
chapter
xxxii
it
was
an
afternoon
in
the
following
winter
in
the
pilot
home
his
wife
was
expecting
him
and
kept
looking
uneasily
out
of
the
window
he
was
to
have
been
home
by
noon
and
it
was
now
beginning
to
get
dark
and
the
weather
had
been
stormy
the
whole
of
the
previous
day
she
gave
up
sewing
and
sat
thinking
in
the
twilight
with
the
light
playing
over
the
floor
from
the
door
of
the
stove
where
a
little
kettle
was
boiling
that
she
might
have
something
warm
ready
for
him
at
once
when
he
came
it
was
too
early
to
light
a
candle
gjert
was
at
school
in
arendal
living
at
his
aunt
and
henrik
was
sitting
by
the
light
from
the
stove
cutting
up
a
piece
of
wood
into
shavings
it
is
beginning
to
blow
again
henrik
she
said
and
put
a
handkerchief
round
her
head
to
look
out
it
is
no
use
mother
he
pronounced
without
stirring
and
splitting
a
long
peg
into
two
against
his
chest
it
is
it
so
she
gave
it
up
again
before
she
got
to
the
door
but
stood
and
listened
she
thought
she
had
heard
a
shout
outside
he
is
coming
she
cried
suddenly
and
darted
out
and
when
salvé
entered
the
porch
from
the
sleet
squall
that
had
just
come
up
with
his
and
oilskin
coat
all
dripping
he
found
himself
all
wet
as
he
was
suddenly
encircled
in
the
dark
by
a
pair
of
loving
arms
how
long
you
have
been
she
cried
taking
from
him
what
he
had
in
his
hands
and
preceding
him
into
the
house
where
she
lit
a
candle
what
has
kept
you
i
heard
that
you
had
taken
a
galliot
up
to
arendal
yesterday
and
thought
you
would
have
been
here
this
morning
it
was
dreadful
weather
yesterday
salvé
so
i
was
a
little
anxious
she
continued
as
she
helped
him
off
with
his
wet
oilskin
coverings
i
have
done
well
elizabeth
he
said
looking
pleased
on
the
galliot
yes
and
i
had
a
little
matter
to
arrange
in
arendal
which
kept
me
there
till
after
midday
you
saw
gjert
then
i
did
he
looked
a
little
impatiently
towards
the
door
and
he
is
well
he
can
tell
you
now
himself
was
the
reply
as
the
door
at
the
moment
opened
and
gjert
entered
with
a
loud
good
evening
mother
she
sprang
towards
him
in
astonishment
and
threw
her
arms
round
him
and
not
a
dry
stitch
on
the
whole
boy
she
cried
with
motherly
concern
but
salvé
dear
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
how
can
the
boy
come
away
from
school
when
we
have
changed
our
clothes
and
warmed
ourselves
a
little
tell
you
mother
answered
the
pilot
slily
he
will
be
at
home
with
you
the
whole
week
gjert
was
evidently
ready
to
burst
with
some
news
or
other
but
he
had
to
restrain
himself
until
his
father
had
taken
his
seat
by
the
fire
that
was
crackling
brightly
on
the
hearth
in
the
kitchen
and
had
leisurely
filled
his
pipe
and
taken
two
or
three
pulls
at
it
now
then
gjert
he
said
you
may
tell
it
i
see
you
ca
keep
it
in
any
longer
well
mother
he
exclaimed
father
says
that
i
shall
be
an
officer
in
the
navy
and
so
he
has
taken
me
from
school
and
is
going
with
me
to
frederiksvoern
next
week
henrik
mouth
opened
slowly
while
elizabeth
who
was
stirring
the
porridge
suspended
that
operation
and
looked
in
something
like
alarm
at
her
husband
what
do
you
mean
salvé
would
it
be
a
fine
thing
do
you
think
to
see
the
boy
come
home
to
you
some
day
in
a
smart
uniform
elizabeth
you
have
always
had
a
turn
for
that
sort
of
thing
he
added
jokingly
and
since
you
could
go
in
for
it
yourself
as
they
do
take
womenfolk
in
the
navy
and
it
was
not
much
in
my
line
either
why
i
thought
we
could
make
the
experiment
with
gjert
are
you
really
in
earnest
salvé
she
asked
looking
at
him
still
in
suspense
he
nodded
in
confirmation
well
if
it
is
your
father
wish
may
may
god
prosper
you
in
it
my
boy
she
said
going
over
to
gjert
and
stroking
his
forehead
so
now
you
may
take
your
joiner
bench
into
the
room
again
henrik
you
can
talk
with
gjert
in
there
that
is
to
say
if
he
will
condescend
now
to
answer
a
common
man
like
you
tell
him
you
will
be
a
merchant
captain
and
earn
as
much
as
two
such
fellows
in
uniform
mother
and
i
can
then
enjoy
a
little
peace
from
you
here
in
the
kitchen
when
they
were
alone
elizabeth
asked
but
how
has
it
all
happened
salvé
well
you
see
i
had
taken
the
idea
into
my
head
about
gjert
that
he
should
become
something
a
little
better
than
his
father
had
been
and
so
i
went
up
to
the
master
to
beck
and
asked
what
i
must
do
to
push
the
thing
yes
and
i
spoke
to
young
fru
beck
too
salvé
did
you
go
to
beck
yes
i
did
the
boy
must
be
pushed
and
into
the
bargain
i
half
begged
his
pardon
for
the
way
i
used
to
turn
the
rough
edge
of
my
tongue
on
him
and
so
we
were
reconciled
he
is
a
fine
old
fellow
in
reality
and
i
have
wronged
him
he
said
he
had
never
forgotten
that
i
had
saved
the
juno
for
him
and
that
he
had
intended
to
put
me
one
day
in
command
of
her
while
we
were
talking
young
fru
beck
came
in
and
when
she
heard
what
we
were
speaking
about
she
showed
the
greatest
interest
at
once
you
were
an
old
friend
of
hers
she
said
and
she
thought
we
might
get
gjert
into
the
institute
there
free
when
he
had
been
up
for
an
examination
in
the
summer
she
knew
some
of
the
officials
who
would
be
able
to
get
it
done
and
if
the
master
wrote
he
continued
a
little
consciously
that
i
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
remarkable
pilot
who
ought
to
be
salaried
by
the
state
the
thing
would
be
as
good
as
done
so
the
master
wrote
the
application
for
me
there
and
then
see
that
cried
elizabeth
ay
and
he
wrote
a
testimonial
from
himself
underneath
i
had
an
idea
that
i
was
such
a
fine
fellow
he
laughed
you
see
she
cried
looking
at
him
proudly
it
comes
at
last
he
acknowledges
it
now
well
if
we
do
manage
the
thing
that
way
salvé
kristiansen
will
be
able
nevertheless
to
work
it
out
of
his
own
pocket
for
worked
it
shall
be
mind
you
it
wo
be
done
for
nothing
but
we
have
something
in
the
savings
bank
and
the
rest
will
come
right
enough
it
will
be
just
as
well
that
i
should
have
something
to
drive
me
out
of
the
house
occasionally
for
otherwise
i
should
get
too
fond
both
of
it
and
of
you
elizabeth
he
said
and
drew
her
towards
him
i
must
have
a
little
rain
and
storm
now
and
again
it
my
nature
you
know
and
the
master
must
not
be
made
to
have
written
lies
about
me
his
wife
looked
at
him
a
glow
of
deep
feeling
overspread
her
handsome
features
how
happy
we
have
become
salvé
she
exclaimed
if
