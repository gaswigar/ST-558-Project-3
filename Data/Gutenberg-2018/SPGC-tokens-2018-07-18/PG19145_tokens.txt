was

the
time
traders
chapter
to
anyone
who
glanced
casually
inside
the
detention
room
the
young
man
sitting
there
did
not
seem
very
formidable
in
height
he
might
have
been
a
little
above
average
but
not
enough
to
make
him
noticeable
his
brown
hair
was
cropped
conservatively
his
unlined
boy
face
was
not
one
to
be
remembered
unless
one
was
observant
enough
to
note
those
eyes
and
catch
a
chilling
measuring
expression
showing
now
and
then
for
an
instant
in
their
depths
neatly
and
inconspicuously
dressed
in
this
last
quarter
of
the
twentieth
century
his
like
was
to
be
found
on
any
street
of
the
city
ten
floors
below
to
all
outward
appearances
but
that
other
person
under
the
protective
coloring
so
assiduously
cultivated
could
touch
heights
of
encased
and
controlled
fury
which
murdock
himself
did
not
understand
and
was
only
just
learning
to
use
as
a
weapon
against
a
world
he
had
always
found
hostile
he
was
aware
though
he
gave
no
sign
of
it
that
a
guard
was
watching
him
the
cop
on
duty
was
an
old
hand
he
probably
expected
some
reaction
other
than
passive
acceptance
from
the
prisoner
but
he
was
not
going
to
get
it
the
law
had
ross
sewed
up
tight
this
time
why
did
they
get
about
the
business
of
shipping
him
off
why
had
he
had
that
afternoon
session
with
the
skull
thumper
ross
had
been
on
the
defensive
then
and
he
had
not
liked
it
he
had
given
to
the
other
questions
all
the
attention
his
shrewd
mind
could
muster
but
a
faint
very
faint
apprehension
still
clung
to
the
memory
of
that
meeting
the
door
of
the
detention
room
opened
ross
did
not
turn
his
head
but
the
guard
cleared
his
throat
as
if
their
hour
of
mutual
silence
had
dried
his
vocal
cords
on
your
feet
murdock
the
judge
wants
to
see
you
ross
rose
smoothly
with
every
muscle
under
fluid
control
it
never
paid
to
talk
back
to
allow
any
sign
of
defiance
to
show
he
would
go
through
the
motions
as
if
he
were
a
bad
little
boy
who
had
realized
his
errors
it
was
a
act
that
had
paid
off
more
than
once
in
checkered
past
so
he
faced
the
man
seated
behind
the
desk
in
the
other
room
with
an
uncertain
diffident
smile
standing
with
boyish
awkwardness
respectfully
waiting
for
the
other
to
speak
first
judge
ord
rawle
it
was
his
rotten
luck
to
pull
old
eagle
beak
on
his
case
well
he
would
simply
have
to
take
it
when
the
old
boy
dished
it
out
not
that
he
had
to
remain
stuck
with
it
later
you
have
a
bad
record
young
man
ross
allowed
his
smile
to
fade
his
shoulders
slumped
but
under
concealing
lids
his
eyes
showed
an
instant
of
cold
defiance
yes
sir
he
agreed
in
a
voice
carefully
cultivated
to
shake
convincingly
about
the
edges
then
suddenly
all
ross
pleasure
in
the
skill
of
his
act
was
wiped
away
judge
rawle
was
not
alone
that
blasted
skull
thumper
was
sitting
there
watching
the
prisoner
with
the
same
keenness
he
had
shown
the
other
day
a
very
bad
record
for
the
few
years
you
have
had
to
make
it
eagle
beak
was
staring
at
him
too
but
without
the
same
look
of
penetration
luckily
for
ross
by
rights
you
should
be
turned
over
to
the
new
rehabilitation
service
ross
froze
inside
that
was
the
treatment
icy
rumors
of
which
had
spread
throughout
his
particular
world
for
the
second
time
since
he
had
entered
the
room
his
was
jarred
then
he
clung
with
a
degree
of
hope
to
the
phrasing
of
that
last
sentence
instead
i
have
been
authorized
to
offer
you
a
choice
murdock
one
which
i
shall
state
and
on
record
i
do
not
in
the
least
approve
ross
twinge
of
fear
faded
if
the
judge
did
like
it
there
must
be
something
in
it
to
the
advantage
of
ross
murdock
he
grab
it
for
sure
there
is
a
government
project
in
need
of
volunteers
it
seems
that
you
have
tested
out
as
possible
material
for
this
assignment
if
you
sign
for
it
the
law
will
consider
the
time
spent
on
it
as
part
of
your
sentence
thus
you
may
aid
the
country
which
you
have
heretofore
disgraced
and
if
i
refuse
i
go
to
this
rehabilitation
is
that
right
sir
i
certainly
consider
you
a
fit
candidate
for
rehabilitation
your
record
he
shuffled
through
the
papers
on
his
desk
i
choose
to
volunteer
for
the
project
sir
the
judge
snorted
and
pushed
all
the
papers
into
a
folder
he
spoke
to
a
man
waiting
in
the
shadows
here
then
is
your
volunteer
major
ross
bottled
in
his
relief
he
was
over
the
first
hump
and
since
his
luck
had
held
so
far
he
might
be
about
to
win
all
the
way
the
man
judge
rawle
called
major
moved
into
the
light
at
the
first
glance
ross
to
his
hidden
annoyance
found
himself
uneasy
to
face
up
to
eagle
beak
was
all
part
of
the
game
but
somehow
he
sensed
one
did
not
play
such
games
with
this
man
thank
you
your
honor
we
will
be
on
our
way
at
once
this
weather
is
not
very
promising
before
he
realized
what
was
happening
ross
found
himself
walking
meekly
to
the
door
he
considered
trying
to
give
the
major
the
slip
when
they
left
the
building
losing
himself
in
a
city
but
they
did
not
take
the
elevator
downstairs
instead
they
climbed
two
or
three
flights
up
the
emergency
stairs
and
to
his
humiliation
ross
found
himself
panting
and
slowing
while
the
other
man
who
must
have
been
a
good
dozen
years
his
senior
showed
no
signs
of
discomfort
they
came
out
into
the
snow
on
the
roof
and
the
major
flashed
a
torch
skyward
guiding
in
a
dark
shadow
which
touched
down
before
them
a
helicopter
for
the
first
time
ross
began
to
doubt
the
wisdom
of
his
choice
on
your
way
murdock
the
voice
was
impersonal
enough
but
that
very
impersonality
got
under
one
skin
bundled
into
the
machine
between
the
silent
major
and
an
equally
quiet
pilot
in
uniform
ross
was
lifted
over
the
city
whose
ways
he
knew
as
well
as
he
knew
the
lines
on
his
own
palm
into
the
unknown
he
was
already
beginning
to
regard
dubiously
the
lighted
streets
and
buildings
their
outlines
softened
by
the
soft
wet
snow
fell
out
of
sight
now
they
could
mark
the
outer
highways
ross
refused
to
ask
any
questions
he
could
take
this
silent
treatment
he
taken
a
lot
of
tougher
things
in
the
past
the
patches
of
light
disappeared
and
the
country
opened
out
the
plane
banked
ross
with
all
the
familiar
landmarks
of
his
world
gone
could
not
have
said
if
they
were
headed
north
or
south
but
moments
later
not
even
the
thick
curtain
of
snowflakes
could
blot
out
the
pattern
of
red
lights
on
the
ground
and
the
helicopter
settled
down
come
on
for
the
second
time
ross
obeyed
he
stood
shivering
engulfed
in
a
miniature
blizzard
his
clothing
protection
enough
in
the
city
did
little
good
against
the
push
of
the
wind
a
hand
gripped
his
upper
arm
and
he
was
drawn
forward
to
a
low
building
a
door
banged
and
ross
and
his
companion
came
into
a
region
of
light
and
very
welcome
heat
sit
down
over
there
too
bewildered
to
resent
orders
ross
sat
there
were
other
men
in
the
room
one
wearing
a
queer
suit
of
padded
clothing
a
bulbous
headgear
hooked
over
his
arm
was
reading
a
paper
the
major
crossed
to
speak
to
him
and
after
they
conferred
for
a
moment
the
major
beckoned
ross
with
a
crooked
finger
ross
trailed
the
officer
into
an
inner
room
lined
with
lockers
from
one
of
the
lockers
the
major
pulled
a
suit
like
the
pilot
and
began
to
measure
it
against
ross
all
right
he
snapped
climb
into
this
we
have
all
night
ross
climbed
into
the
suit
as
soon
as
he
fastened
the
last
zipper
his
companion
jammed
one
of
the
domed
helmets
on
his
head
the
pilot
looked
in
the
door
we
better
scramble
kelgarries
or
we
may
be
grounded
for
the
duration
they
hurried
back
to
the
flying
field
if
the
helicopter
had
been
a
surprising
mode
of
travel
this
new
machine
was
something
straight
out
of
the
future
a
ship
poised
on
fins
its
sharp
nose
lifting
vertically
into
the
heavens
there
was
a
scaffolding
along
one
side
which
the
pilot
scaled
to
enter
the
ship
unwillingly
ross
climbed
the
same
ladder
and
found
that
he
must
wedge
himself
in
on
his
back
his
knees
hunched
up
almost
under
his
chin
to
make
it
worse
cramped
as
those
quarters
were
he
had
to
share
them
with
the
major
a
transparent
hood
snapped
down
and
was
secured
sealing
them
in
during
his
short
lifetime
ross
had
often
been
afraid
bitterly
afraid
he
had
fought
to
toughen
his
mind
and
body
against
such
fears
but
what
he
experienced
now
was
no
ordinary
fear
it
was
panic
so
strong
that
it
made
him
feel
sick
to
be
shut
in
this
small
place
with
the
knowledge
that
he
had
no
control
over
his
immediate
future
brought
him
face
to
face
with
every
terror
he
had
ever
known
all
of
them
combined
into
one
horrible
whole
how
long
does
a
nightmare
last
a
moment
an
hour
ross
could
not
time
his
but
at
last
the
weight
of
a
giant
hand
clamped
down
on
his
chest
and
he
fought
for
breath
until
the
world
exploded
about
him
he
came
back
to
consciousness
slowly
for
a
second
he
thought
he
was
blind
then
he
began
to
sort
out
one
shade
of
grayish
light
from
another
finally
ross
became
aware
that
he
no
longer
rested
on
his
back
but
was
slumped
in
a
seat
the
world
about
him
was
wrung
with
a
vibration
that
beat
in
turn
through
his
body
ross
murdock
had
remained
at
liberty
as
long
as
he
had
because
he
was
able
to
analyze
a
situation
quickly
seldom
in
the
past
five
years
had
he
been
at
a
loss
to
deal
with
any
challenging
person
or
action
now
he
was
aware
that
he
was
on
the
defensive
and
was
being
kept
there
he
stared
into
the
dark
and
thought
hard
and
furiously
he
was
convinced
that
everything
that
was
happening
to
him
this
day
was
designed
with
only
one
end
in
view
to
shake
his
and
make
him
pliable
why
ross
had
an
enduring
belief
in
his
own
abilities
and
he
also
possessed
a
kind
of
shrewd
understanding
seldom
granted
to
one
so
young
he
knew
that
while
murdock
was
important
to
murdock
he
was
none
too
important
in
the
scheme
of
things
as
a
whole
he
had
a
record
a
record
so
bad
that
rawle
might
easily
have
thrown
the
book
at
him
but
it
differed
in
one
important
way
from
that
of
many
of
his
fellows
until
now
he
had
been
able
to
beat
most
of
the
raps
ross
believed
this
was
largely
because
he
had
always
worked
alone
and
taken
pains
to
plan
a
job
in
advance
why
now
had
ross
murdock
become
so
important
to
someone
that
they
would
do
all
this
to
shake
him
he
was
a
volunteer
for
what
to
be
a
guinea
pig
for
some
bug
they
wanted
to
learn
how
to
kill
cheaply
and
easily
they
been
in
a
big
hurry
to
push
him
off
base
using
the
silent
treatment
this
rushing
around
in
planes
they
were
really
working
to
keep
him
groggy
so
all
right
he
give
them
a
groggy
boy
all
set
up
for
their
job
whatever
it
was
only
was
his
act
good
enough
to
fool
the
major
ross
had
a
hunch
that
it
might
not
be
and
that
really
hurt
it
was
deep
night
now
either
they
had
flown
out
of
the
path
of
the
storm
or
were
above
it
there
were
stars
shining
through
the
cover
of
the
cockpit
but
no
moon
ross
formal
education
was
sketchy
but
in
his
own
fashion
he
had
acquired
a
range
of
knowledge
which
would
have
surprised
many
of
the
authorities
who
had
had
to
deal
with
him
all
the
wealth
of
a
big
city
library
had
been
his
to
explore
and
he
had
spent
much
time
there
soaking
up
facts
in
many
odd
branches
of
learning
facts
were
very
useful
things
on
at
least
three
occasions
assorted
scraps
of
knowledge
had
preserved
ross
freedom
once
perhaps
his
life
now
he
tried
to
fit
together
the
scattered
facts
he
knew
about
his
present
situation
into
some
proper
pattern
he
was
inside
some
new
type
of
atomjet
a
machine
so
advanced
in
design
that
it
would
not
have
been
used
for
anything
that
was
not
an
important
mission
which
meant
that
ross
murdock
had
become
necessary
to
someone
somewhere
knowing
that
fact
should
give
him
a
slight
edge
in
the
future
and
he
might
well
need
such
an
edge
he
just
have
to
wait
play
dumb
and
use
his
eyes
and
ears
at
the
rate
they
were
shooting
along
they
ought
to
be
out
of
the
country
in
a
couple
of
hours
did
the
government
have
bases
half
over
the
world
to
keep
the
cold
peace
well
there
was
nothing
for
it
to
be
planted
abroad
someplace
might
interfere
with
plans
for
escape
but
handle
that
detail
when
he
was
forced
to
face
it
then
suddenly
ross
was
on
his
back
once
more
the
giant
hand
digging
into
his
chest
and
middle
this
time
there
were
no
lights
on
the
ground
to
guide
them
in
ross
had
no
intimation
that
they
had
reached
their
destination
until
they
set
down
with
a
jar
which
snapped
his
teeth
together
the
major
wriggled
out
and
ross
was
able
to
stretch
his
cramped
body
but
the
other
hand
was
already
on
his
shoulder
urging
him
along
ross
crawled
free
and
clung
dizzily
to
a
ladderlike
disembarking
structure
below
there
were
no
lights
only
an
expanse
of
open
snow
men
were
moving
across
that
blank
area
gathering
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
ross
was
hungry
and
very
tired
if
the
major
wanted
to
play
games
he
hoped
that
such
action
could
wait
until
the
next
morning
in
the
meantime
he
must
learn
where
here
was
if
he
had
a
chance
to
run
he
wanted
to
know
the
surrounding
territory
but
that
hand
was
on
his
arm
drawing
him
along
toward
a
door
that
stood
as
far
as
ross
could
see
it
led
to
the
interior
of
a
hillock
of
snow
either
the
storm
or
men
had
done
a
very
good
job
and
somehow
ross
knew
the
camouflage
was
intentional
that
was
ross
introduction
to
the
base
and
after
his
arrival
his
view
of
the
installation
was
extremely
limited
one
day
was
spent
in
undergoing
the
most
searching
physical
he
had
ever
experienced
and
after
the
doctors
had
poked
and
pried
he
was
faced
by
a
series
of
other
tests
no
one
bothered
to
explain
thereafter
he
was
introduced
to
solitary
that
is
confined
to
his
own
company
in
a
room
with
a
bunk
that
was
more
comfortable
than
it
looked
and
an
announcer
in
a
corner
of
the
ceiling
so
far
he
had
been
told
exactly
nothing
and
so
far
he
had
asked
no
questions
stubbornly
keeping
up
his
end
of
what
he
believed
to
be
a
tug
of
wills
at
the
moment
safely
alone
and
lying
flat
on
his
bunk
he
eyed
the
announcer
a
very
dangerous
young
man
and
one
who
refused
to
yield
an
inch
now
hear
this
the
voice
transmitted
through
that
grill
was
metallic
but
its
rasp
held
overtones
of
kelgarries
voice
ross
lips
tightened
he
had
explored
every
inch
of
the
walls
and
knew
that
there
was
no
trace
of
the
door
which
had
admitted
him
with
only
his
bare
hands
to
work
with
he
could
not
break
out
and
his
only
clothes
were
the
shirt
sturdy
slacks
and
a
pair
of
moccasins
that
they
had
given
him
to
identify
droned
the
voice
ross
realized
that
he
must
have
missed
something
not
that
it
mattered
he
was
almost
determined
not
to
play
along
any
more
there
was
a
click
signifying
that
kelgarries
was
through
braying
but
the
customary
silence
did
not
close
in
again
instead
ross
heard
a
clear
sweet
trilling
which
he
vaguely
associated
with
a
bird
his
acquaintance
with
all
feathered
life
was
limited
to
city
sparrows
and
plump
park
pigeons
neither
of
which
raised
their
voices
in
song
but
surely
those
sounds
were
bird
notes
ross
glanced
from
the
mike
in
the
ceiling
to
the
opposite
wall
and
what
he
saw
there
made
him
sit
up
with
the
instant
response
of
an
alerted
fighter
for
the
wall
was
no
longer
there
instead
there
was
a
sharp
slope
of
ground
cutting
down
from
peaks
where
the
dark
green
of
fir
trees
ran
close
to
the
snow
line
patches
of
snow
clung
to
the
earth
in
sheltered
places
and
the
scent
of
those
pines
was
in
ross
nostrils
real
as
the
wind
touching
him
with
its
chill
he
shivered
as
a
howl
sounded
loudly
and
echoed
bearing
the
warning
of
a
wolf
pack
hungry
and
ross
had
never
heard
that
sound
before
but
his
human
heritage
subconsciously
recognized
it
for
what
it
was
death
on
four
feet
similarly
he
was
able
to
identify
the
gray
shadows
slinking
about
the
nearest
trees
and
his
hands
balled
into
fists
as
he
looked
wildly
about
him
for
some
weapon
the
bunk
was
under
him
and
three
of
the
four
walls
of
the
room
enclosed
him
like
a
cave
but
one
of
those
gray
skulkers
had
raised
its
head
and
was
looking
directly
at
him
its
reddish
eyes
alight
ross
ripped
the
top
blanket
off
the
bunk
with
a
idea
of
snapping
it
at
the
animal
when
it
sprang
the
beast
advanced
a
guttural
growl
sounding
deep
in
its
throat
to
ross
the
animal
larger
than
any
dog
he
had
even
seen
and
twice
as
vicious
was
a
monster
he
had
the
blanket
ready
before
he
realized
that
the
wolf
was
not
watching
him
after
all
and
that
its
attention
was
focused
on
a
point
out
of
his
line
of
vision
the
wolfs
muzzle
wrinkled
in
a
snarl
revealing
long
teeth
there
was
a
singing
twang
and
the
animal
leaped
into
the
air
fell
back
and
rolled
on
the
ground
biting
despairingly
at
a
shaft
protruding
from
just
behind
its
ribs
it
howled
again
and
blood
broke
from
its
mouth
ross
was
beyond
surprise
now
he
pulled
himself
together
and
got
up
to
walk
steadily
toward
the
dying
wolf
and
he
was
in
the
least
amazed
when
his
outstretched
hands
flattened
against
an
unseen
barrier
slowly
he
swept
his
hands
right
and
left
sure
that
he
was
touching
the
wall
of
his
cell
yet
his
eyes
told
him
he
was
on
a
mountain
side
and
every
sight
sound
and
smell
was
making
it
real
to
him
puzzled
he
thought
a
moment
and
then
finding
an
explanation
that
satisfied
him
he
nodded
once
and
went
back
to
sit
at
ease
on
his
bunk
this
must
be
some
superior
form
of
tv
that
included
odors
the
illusion
of
wind
and
other
fancy
touches
to
make
it
more
vivid
the
total
effect
was
so
convincing
that
ross
had
to
keep
reminding
himself
that
it
was
all
just
a
picture
the
wolf
was
dead
its
pack
mates
had
fled
into
the
brush
but
since
the
picture
remained
ross
decided
that
the
show
was
not
yet
over
he
could
still
hear
a
click
of
sound
and
he
waited
for
the
next
bit
of
action
but
the
reason
for
his
viewing
it
still
eluded
him
a
man
came
into
view
crossing
before
ross
he
stooped
to
examine
the
dead
wolf
catching
it
by
the
tail
and
hoisting
its
hindquarters
off
the
ground
comparing
the
beast
size
with
the
hunter
ross
saw
that
he
had
not
been
wrong
in
his
estimation
of
the
animal
unusually
large
dimensions
the
man
shouted
over
his
shoulder
his
words
distinct
enough
but
unintelligible
to
ross
the
stranger
was
oddly
dressed
too
lightly
dressed
if
one
judged
the
climate
by
the
frequent
snow
patches
and
the
biting
cold
a
strip
of
coarse
cloth
extending
from
his
armpit
to
about
four
inches
above
the
knee
was
wound
about
his
body
and
pulled
in
at
the
waist
by
a
belt
the
belt
far
more
ornate
than
the
cumbersome
wrapping
was
made
of
many
small
chains
linking
metal
plates
and
supported
a
long
dagger
which
hung
straight
in
front
the
man
also
wore
a
round
blue
cloak
now
swept
back
on
his
shoulders
to
free
his
bare
arms
which
was
fastened
by
a
large
pin
under
his
chin
his
footgear
which
extended
above
his
calves
was
made
of
animal
hide
still
bearing
patches
of
shaggy
hair
his
face
was
beardless
though
a
shadowy
line
along
his
chin
suggested
that
he
had
not
shaved
that
particular
day
a
fur
cap
concealed
most
of
his
hair
was
he
an
indian
no
for
although
his
skin
was
tanned
it
was
as
fair
as
ross
under
that
weathering
and
his
clothing
did
not
resemble
any
indian
apparel
ross
had
ever
seen
yet
in
spite
of
his
primitive
trappings
the
man
had
such
an
aura
of
authority
of
and
competence
that
it
was
clear
he
was
top
dog
in
his
own
section
of
the
world
soon
another
man
dressed
much
like
the
first
but
with
a
cloak
came
along
pulling
behind
him
two
very
reluctant
donkeys
whose
eyes
rolled
fearfully
at
sight
of
the
dead
wolf
both
animals
wore
packs
lashed
on
their
backs
by
ropes
of
twisted
hide
then
another
man
came
along
with
another
brace
of
donkeys
finally
a
fourth
man
wearing
skins
for
covering
and
with
a
mat
of
beard
on
his
cheeks
and
chin
appeared
his
uncovered
head
a
bush
of
uncombed
flaxen
hair
shone
whitish
as
he
knelt
beside
the
dead
beast
a
knife
with
a
blade
in
his
hand
and
set
to
work
skinning
the
wolf
with
appreciable
skill
three
more
pairs
of
donkeys
all
heavily
laden
were
led
past
the
scene
before
he
finished
his
task
finally
he
rolled
the
bloody
skin
into
a
bundle
and
gave
the
flayed
body
a
kick
before
he
ran
lightly
after
the
disappearing
train
of
pack
animals
chapter
ross
absorbed
in
the
scene
before
him
was
not
prepared
for
the
sudden
and
complete
darkness
which
blotted
out
not
only
the
action
but
the
light
in
his
own
room
as
well
what
his
startled
voice
rang
loudly
in
his
ears
too
loudly
for
all
sound
had
been
wiped
out
with
the
light
the
faint
swish
of
the
ventilating
system
of
which
he
had
not
been
actively
aware
until
it
had
disappeared
was
also
missing
a
trace
of
the
same
panic
he
had
known
in
the
cockpit
of
the
atomjet
tingled
along
his
nerves
but
this
time
he
could
meet
the
unknown
with
action
ross
slowly
moved
through
the
dark
his
hands
outstretched
before
him
to
ward
off
contact
with
the
wall
he
was
determined
that
somehow
he
would
discover
the
hidden
door
escape
from
this
dark
cell
there
his
palm
struck
flat
against
a
smooth
surface
he
swept
out
his
hand
and
suddenly
it
passed
over
emptiness
ross
explored
by
touch
there
a
door
and
now
it
was
open
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
upset
by
a
nagging
little
fear
that
if
he
stepped
through
he
would
be
out
on
the
hillside
with
the
wolves
that
stupid
again
he
spoke
aloud
and
just
because
he
did
feel
uneasy
he
moved
all
the
frustrations
of
the
past
hours
built
up
in
him
a
raging
desire
to
do
something
anything
just
so
long
as
it
was
what
wanted
to
do
and
not
at
another
orders
nevertheless
ross
continued
to
move
slowly
for
the
space
beyond
that
open
door
was
as
deep
and
dark
a
pit
as
the
room
he
left
to
squeeze
along
one
wall
using
an
outstretched
arm
as
a
guide
was
the
best
procedure
he
decided
a
few
feet
farther
on
his
shoulder
slipped
from
the
surface
and
he
half
tumbled
into
another
open
door
but
there
was
the
wall
again
and
he
clung
to
it
thankfully
another
door
ross
paused
trying
to
catch
some
faint
sound
the
slightest
hint
that
he
was
not
alone
in
this
blindman
maze
but
without
even
air
currents
to
stir
it
the
blackness
itself
took
on
a
thick
solidity
which
encased
him
as
a
congealing
jelly
the
wall
ended
ross
kept
his
left
hand
on
it
flailed
out
with
his
right
and
felt
his
nails
scrape
across
another
surface
the
space
separating
the
two
surfaces
was
wider
than
any
doorway
was
it
a
he
was
about
to
make
a
wider
arm
sweep
when
he
heard
a
sound
he
was
not
alone
ross
went
back
to
the
wall
flattening
himself
against
it
trying
to
control
the
volume
of
his
own
breathing
in
order
to
catch
the
slightest
whisper
of
the
other
noise
he
discovered
that
lack
of
sight
can
confuse
the
ear
he
could
not
identify
those
clicks
the
wisp
of
fluttering
sound
that
might
be
air
displaced
by
the
opening
of
another
door
finally
he
detected
something
moving
at
floor
level
someone
or
something
must
be
creeping
not
walking
toward
him
ross
pushed
back
around
the
corner
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
challenge
that
crawler
there
was
an
element
of
danger
in
this
strange
encounter
in
the
dark
it
was
not
meant
to
be
a
meeting
between
fellow
explorers
the
sound
of
crawling
was
not
steady
there
were
long
pauses
and
ross
became
convinced
that
each
rest
was
punctuated
by
heavy
breathing
as
if
the
crawler
was
finding
progress
a
great
and
exhausting
effort
he
fought
the
picture
that
persisted
in
his
imagination
that
of
a
wolf
snuffling
along
the
hall
caution
suggested
a
quick
retreat
but
ross
urge
to
rebellion
held
him
where
he
was
crouching
straining
to
see
what
crept
toward
him
suddenly
there
was
a
blinding
flare
of
light
and
ross
hands
went
to
cover
his
dazzled
eyes
and
he
heard
a
despairing
choked
exclamation
from
near
to
floor
level
the
same
steady
light
that
normally
filled
hall
and
room
was
bright
again
ross
found
himself
standing
at
the
juncture
of
two
corridors
momentarily
he
was
absurdly
pleased
that
he
had
deduced
that
correctly
and
the
crawler
a
man
at
least
the
figure
was
a
body
reasonably
human
in
outline
was
lying
several
yards
away
but
the
body
was
so
wrapped
in
bandages
and
the
head
so
totally
muffled
that
it
lacked
all
identity
for
that
reason
it
was
the
more
startling
one
of
the
mittened
hands
moved
slightly
raising
the
body
from
the
ground
so
it
could
squirm
forward
an
inch
or
so
before
ross
could
move
a
man
came
running
into
the
corridor
from
the
far
end
murdock
recognized
major
kelgarries
he
wet
his
lips
as
the
major
went
down
on
his
knees
beside
the
creature
on
the
floor
hardy
hardy
that
voice
which
carried
the
snap
of
command
whenever
it
was
addressed
to
ross
was
now
warmly
human
hardy
man
the
major
hands
were
on
the
bandaged
body
lifting
it
easing
the
head
and
shoulders
back
against
his
arm
it
all
right
hardy
back
safe
this
is
the
base
hardy
he
spoke
slowly
soothingly
with
the
steadiness
one
would
use
to
comfort
a
frightened
child
those
mittened
paws
which
had
beat
feebly
into
the
air
fell
onto
the
chest
back
safe
the
voice
from
behind
the
face
mask
was
a
rusty
croak
back
safe
the
major
assured
him
dark
dark
all
around
again
protested
the
croak
just
a
power
failure
man
everything
all
right
now
we
get
you
into
bed
the
mitten
pawed
again
until
it
touched
kelgarries
arm
then
it
flexed
a
little
as
if
the
hand
under
it
was
trying
to
grip
safe
you
bet
you
are
the
major
tone
carried
firm
reassurance
now
kelgarries
looked
up
at
ross
as
if
he
knew
the
other
had
been
there
all
the
time
murdock
get
down
to
the
end
room
call
dr
farrell
yes
sir
the
sir
came
so
automatically
that
ross
had
already
reached
the
end
room
before
he
realized
he
had
used
it
nobody
explained
matters
to
ross
murdock
the
bandaged
hardy
was
claimed
by
the
doctor
and
two
attendants
and
carried
away
the
major
walking
beside
the
stretcher
still
holding
one
of
the
mittened
hands
in
his
ross
hesitated
sure
he
was
not
supposed
to
follow
but
not
ready
either
to
explore
farther
or
return
to
his
own
room
the
sight
of
hardy
whoever
he
might
be
had
radically
changed
ross
conception
of
the
project
he
had
too
speedily
volunteered
to
join
that
what
they
did
here
was
important
ross
had
never
doubted
that
it
was
dangerous
he
had
early
suspected
but
his
awareness
had
been
an
abstract
concept
of
danger
not
connected
with
such
concrete
evidence
as
hardy
crawling
through
the
dark
from
the
first
ross
had
nursed
vague
plans
for
escape
now
he
knew
he
must
get
out
of
this
place
lest
he
end
up
a
twin
for
hardy
murdock
having
heard
no
warning
sound
from
behind
ross
whirled
ready
to
use
his
fists
his
only
weapons
but
he
did
not
face
the
major
or
any
of
the
other
taciturn
men
he
knew
held
positions
of
authority
the
newcomer
brown
skin
was
startling
against
the
neutral
shade
of
the
walls
his
hair
and
brows
were
only
a
few
shades
darker
but
the
general
sameness
of
color
was
relieved
by
the
vivid
blue
of
his
eyes
expressionless
the
dark
stranger
stood
quietly
his
arms
hanging
loosely
by
his
sides
studying
ross
as
if
the
younger
man
was
some
problem
he
had
been
assigned
to
solve
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
a
monotone
lacking
any
modulation
of
feeling
i
am
ashe
he
introduced
himself
baldly
he
might
have
been
saying
this
is
a
table
and
that
is
a
chair
ross
quick
temper
took
spark
from
the
other
indifference
all
right
so
you
ashe
he
strove
to
make
a
challenge
of
it
and
what
is
that
supposed
to
mean
but
the
other
did
not
rise
to
the
bait
he
shrugged
for
the
time
being
we
have
been
partnered
partnered
for
what
demanded
ross
controlling
his
temper
we
work
in
pairs
here
the
machine
sorts
us
he
answered
briefly
and
consulted
his
wrist
watch
mess
call
soon
ashe
had
already
turned
away
and
ross
could
not
stand
the
other
lack
of
interest
while
murdock
refused
to
ask
questions
of
the
major
or
any
others
on
that
side
of
the
fence
surely
he
could
get
some
information
from
a
fellow
volunteer
what
is
this
place
anyway
he
asked
the
other
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
operation
retrograde
ross
swallowed
his
anger
okay
but
what
do
they
do
here
listen
i
just
saw
a
fellow
who
been
banged
up
as
if
he
been
in
a
concrete
mixer
creeping
along
this
hall
what
sort
of
work
do
they
do
here
and
what
do
we
have
to
do
to
his
amazement
ashe
smiled
at
least
his
lips
quirked
faintly
hardy
got
under
your
skin
eh
well
we
have
our
percentage
of
failures
they
are
as
few
as
it
humanly
possible
to
make
and
they
give
us
every
advantage
that
can
be
worked
out
for
us
failures
at
what
operation
retrograde
somewhere
down
the
hall
a
buzzer
gave
a
muted
whirr
that
mess
call
and
i
hungry
even
if
you
not
ashe
walked
away
as
if
ross
murdock
had
ceased
to
exist
but
ross
murdock
did
exist
and
to
him
that
was
an
important
fact
as
he
trailed
along
behind
ashe
he
determined
that
he
was
going
to
continue
to
exist
in
one
piece
and
unharmed
operation
retrograde
or
no
operation
retrograde
and
he
was
going
to
pry
a
few
enlightening
answers
out
of
somebody
very
soon
to
his
surprise
he
found
ashe
waiting
for
him
at
the
door
of
a
room
from
which
came
the
sound
of
voices
and
a
subdued
clatter
of
trays
and
tableware
not
many
in
tonight
ashe
commented
in
a
tone
it
been
a
busy
week
the
room
was
rather
sparsely
occupied
five
tables
were
empty
while
the
men
gathered
at
the
remaining
two
ross
counted
ten
men
either
already
eating
or
coming
back
from
a
serving
hatch
with
trays
all
of
them
were
dressed
in
slacks
shirt
and
moccasins
like
himself
the
outfit
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
undress
uniform
and
six
of
them
were
ordinary
in
physical
appearance
the
other
four
differed
so
radically
that
ross
could
barely
conceal
his
amazement
since
their
fellows
accepted
them
without
comment
ross
silently
stole
glances
at
them
as
he
waited
behind
ashe
for
a
tray
one
pair
were
clearly
oriental
they
were
small
lean
men
with
thin
brackets
of
long
black
mustache
on
either
side
of
their
mobile
mouths
yet
he
had
caught
a
word
or
two
of
their
conversation
and
they
spoke
his
own
language
with
the
facility
of
the
native
born
in
addition
to
the
mustaches
each
wore
a
blue
tattoo
mark
on
the
forehead
and
others
of
the
same
design
on
the
backs
of
their
agile
hands
the
second
duo
were
even
more
fantastic
the
color
of
their
flaxen
hair
was
normal
but
they
wore
it
in
braids
long
enough
to
swing
across
their
powerful
shoulders
a
fashion
unlike
any
ross
had
ever
seen
yet
any
suggestion
of
effeminacy
certainly
did
not
survive
beyond
the
first
glance
at
their
ruggedly
masculine
features
gordon
one
of
the
braided
giants
swung
halfway
around
from
the
table
to
halt
ashe
as
he
came
down
the
aisle
with
his
tray
when
did
you
get
back
and
where
is
sanford
one
of
the
orientals
laid
down
the
spoon
with
which
he
had
been
vigorously
stirring
his
coffee
and
asked
with
real
concern
another
loss
ashe
shook
his
head
just
reassignment
sandy
holding
down
outpost
gog
and
doing
well
he
grinned
and
his
face
came
to
life
with
an
expression
of
impish
humor
ross
would
not
have
believed
possible
end
up
with
a
million
or
two
if
he
does
watch
out
he
takes
to
trade
as
if
he
were
born
with
a
beaker
in
his
fist
the
oriental
laughed
and
then
glanced
at
ross
your
new
partner
ashe
some
of
the
animation
disappeared
from
ashe
brown
face
he
was
noncommittal
again
temporary
assignment
this
is
murdock
the
introduction
was
flat
enough
to
daunt
ross
hodaki
feng
he
indicated
the
two
easterners
with
a
nod
as
he
put
down
his
tray
jansen
van
wyke
that
accounted
for
the
blonds
ashe
a
man
arose
at
the
other
table
and
came
to
stand
beside
theirs
thin
with
a
dark
narrow
face
and
restless
eyes
he
was
much
younger
than
the
others
younger
and
not
so
well
controlled
he
might
answer
questions
if
there
was
something
in
it
for
him
ross
decided
and
filed
the
thought
away
well
kurt
ashe
recognition
was
as
dampening
as
it
could
be
and
ross
estimation
of
the
younger
man
went
up
a
fraction
when
the
snub
appeared
to
have
no
effect
upon
him
did
you
hear
about
hardy
feng
looked
as
if
he
were
about
to
speak
and
van
wyke
frowned
ashe
made
a
deliberate
process
of
chewing
and
swallowing
before
he
replied
naturally
his
tone
reduced
whatever
had
happened
to
hardy
to
a
proceeding
far
removed
from
kurt
implied
melodrama
he
smashed
up
kaput
kurt
accent
slight
in
the
beginning
was
thickening
tortured
ashe
regarded
him
levelly
you
are
on
hardy
run
are
you
still
kurt
refused
to
be
quashed
of
course
i
not
you
know
the
run
i
am
in
training
for
but
that
is
not
saying
that
such
can
not
happen
as
well
on
my
run
or
yours
or
yours
he
pointed
a
stabbing
finger
at
feng
and
then
at
the
blond
men
you
can
fall
out
of
bed
and
break
your
neck
too
if
your
number
comes
up
that
way
observed
jansen
go
cry
on
millaird
shoulder
if
it
hurts
you
that
much
you
were
told
the
score
at
your
briefing
you
know
why
you
were
picked
ross
caught
a
faint
glance
aimed
at
him
by
ashe
he
was
still
totally
in
the
dark
but
he
would
not
try
to
pry
any
information
from
this
crowd
maybe
part
of
their
training
was
this
business
he
would
wait
and
see
until
he
could
get
kurt
aside
and
do
a
little
pumping
meanwhile
he
ate
stolidly
and
tried
to
cover
up
his
interest
in
the
conversation
then
you
are
going
to
keep
on
saying
sir
sir
to
every
order
here
hodaki
slammed
his
tattooed
hand
on
the
table
why
this
foolishness
kurt
you
well
know
how
and
why
we
are
picked
for
runs
hardy
had
the
deck
stacked
against
him
through
no
fault
of
the
project
that
has
happened
before
it
will
happen
again
which
is
what
i
have
been
saying
do
you
wish
it
to
happen
to
you
pretty
games
those
tribesmen
on
your
run
play
with
their
prisoners
do
they
not
oh
shut
up
jansen
got
to
his
feet
since
he
loomed
at
least
five
inches
above
kurt
and
probably
could
have
broken
him
in
two
over
one
massive
knee
his
order
was
one
to
be
considered
if
you
have
any
complaints
go
make
them
to
millaird
and
little
man
he
poked
a
massive
forefinger
into
kurt
chest
wait
until
you
make
that
first
run
of
yours
before
you
sound
off
so
loudly
no
one
is
sent
out
without
every
ounce
of
preparation
he
can
take
but
we
ca
set
up
luck
in
advance
and
hardy
was
unlucky
that
that
we
got
him
back
and
that
was
lucky
for
him
he
be
the
first
to
tell
you
so
he
stretched
for
a
game
ashe
hodaki
always
so
energetic
murmured
ashe
but
he
nodded
as
did
the
small
oriental
feng
smiled
at
ross
always
these
three
try
to
beat
each
other
and
so
far
all
the
contests
are
draws
but
we
hope
yes
we
have
hopes
so
ross
had
no
chance
to
speak
to
kurt
instead
he
was
drawn
into
the
knot
of
men
who
having
finished
their
meal
entered
a
small
arena
with
a
half
circle
of
spectator
seats
at
one
side
and
a
space
for
contestants
at
the
other
what
followed
absorbed
ross
as
completely
as
the
earlier
scene
of
the
wolf
killing
this
too
was
a
fight
but
not
a
physical
struggle
all
three
contenders
were
not
only
unlike
in
body
but
as
ross
speedily
came
to
understand
they
were
also
unlike
in
their
mental
approach
to
any
problem
they
seated
themselves
crosslegged
at
the
three
points
of
a
triangle
then
ashe
looked
from
the
tall
blond
to
the
small
oriental
territory
he
asked
crisply
inland
plains
that
came
almost
in
chorus
and
each
man
looking
at
his
opponent
began
to
laugh
ashe
himself
chuckled
trying
to
be
smart
tonight
boys
he
inquired
all
right
plains
it
is
he
brought
his
hand
down
on
the
floor
before
him
and
to
astonishment
the
area
around
the
players
darkened
and
the
floor
became
a
stretch
of
miniature
countryside
grassy
plains
rippled
under
the
wind
of
a
fair
day
red
blue
yellow
the
choices
came
quickly
from
the
dusk
masking
the
players
and
upon
those
orders
points
of
the
designated
color
came
into
being
as
small
lights
red
caravan
ross
recognized
jansen
boom
blue
raiders
hodaki
choice
was
only
an
instant
behind
yellow
unknown
factor
ross
was
sure
that
sigh
came
from
jansen
is
the
unknown
factor
a
natural
phenomenon
no
tribe
on
the
march
ah
hodaki
was
considering
that
ross
could
picture
his
shrug
the
game
began
ross
had
heard
of
chess
of
war
games
played
with
miniature
armies
or
ships
of
games
on
paper
which
demand
from
the
players
a
quick
wit
and
a
trained
memory
this
game
however
was
all
those
combined
and
more
as
his
imagination
came
to
life
the
moving
points
of
light
were
transformed
into
the
raiders
the
caravan
the
tribe
on
the
march
there
was
ingenious
deployment
a
battle
a
retreat
a
small
victory
here
to
be
followed
by
a
bigger
defeat
there
the
game
might
have
gone
on
for
hours
the
men
about
him
muttered
taking
sides
and
arguing
heatedly
in
voices
low
enough
not
to
drown
out
the
moves
called
by
the
players
ross
was
thrilled
when
the
red
traders
avoided
a
very
cleverly
laid
ambush
and
indignant
when
the
tribe
was
forced
to
withdraw
or
the
caravan
lost
points
it
was
the
most
fascinating
game
he
had
ever
seen
and
he
realized
that
the
three
men
ordering
those
moves
were
all
masters
of
strategy
their
respective
skills
checkmated
each
other
so
equally
that
an
outright
win
was
far
away
then
jansen
laughed
and
the
red
line
of
the
caravan
gathered
in
a
tight
knot
camped
at
a
spring
he
announced
but
with
plenty
of
sentries
out
red
sparks
showed
briefly
beyond
that
center
core
and
have
to
stay
there
for
all
of
me
we
could
keep
this
up
till
doomsday
and
nobody
would
crack
no
hodaki
contradicted
him
someday
one
of
you
will
make
a
little
mistake
and
then
and
then
whatever
bully
boys
you
running
will
clobber
us
asked
jansen
that
be
the
day
anyway
truce
for
now
granted
the
lights
of
the
arena
went
on
and
the
plains
vanished
into
a
dark
tiled
floor
any
time
you
want
a
return
engagement
it
be
fine
with
me
said
ashe
getting
up
jansen
grinned
put
that
off
for
a
month
or
so
gordon
we
push
into
time
tomorrow
take
care
of
yourselves
you
two
i
do
want
to
have
to
break
in
another
set
of
players
when
i
come
back
ross
finding
it
difficult
to
shake
off
the
illusion
which
had
held
him
entranced
felt
a
slight
touch
on
his
shoulder
and
glanced
up
kurt
stood
behind
him
apparently
intent
upon
jansen
and
hodaki
as
they
argued
over
some
point
of
the
game
see
you
tonight
the
boy
lips
hardly
moved
a
trick
ross
knew
from
his
own
past
yes
he
see
kurt
tonight
or
whenever
he
could
he
was
going
to
learn
what
it
was
this
odd
company
seemed
determined
to
keep
as
their
own
private
secret
chapter
ross
stood
cautiously
against
the
wall
of
his
darkened
room
his
head
turned
toward
the
slightly
open
door
a
slight
shuffling
sound
had
awakened
him
and
he
was
now
as
ready
as
a
cat
before
her
spring
but
he
did
not
hurl
himself
at
the
figure
now
easing
the
door
farther
open
he
waited
until
the
visitor
was
approaching
the
bunk
before
he
slid
along
the
wall
closing
the
door
and
putting
his
shoulders
against
it
what
the
pitch
ross
demanded
in
a
whisper
there
was
a
ragged
breath
maybe
two
then
a
little
laugh
out
of
the
dark
you
are
ready
the
visitor
accent
left
no
doubt
as
to
his
identity
kurt
was
paying
him
the
promised
visit
did
you
think
that
i
would
be
no
the
dim
figure
sat
without
invitation
on
the
edge
of
the
bunk
i
would
not
be
here
otherwise
murdock
you
are
plenty
have
plenty
on
the
ball
you
see
i
have
heard
things
about
you
like
me
you
were
tricked
into
this
game
tell
me
is
it
not
true
that
you
saw
hardy
tonight
you
hear
a
lot
do
you
ross
was
noncommittal
i
hear
i
see
i
learn
more
than
these
big
mouths
like
the
major
with
all
his
do
and
that
i
can
tell
you
you
saw
hardy
do
want
to
be
a
hardy
is
there
any
danger
of
that
danger
kurt
snorted
danger
you
have
not
yet
known
the
meaning
of
danger
little
man
not
until
now
i
ask
you
again
do
you
want
to
end
like
hardy
they
have
not
yet
looped
you
in
with
all
their
big
talk
that
is
why
i
came
here
tonight
if
you
know
what
is
good
for
you
murdock
you
will
make
a
break
before
they
tape
you
tape
me
kurt
laugh
was
full
of
anger
not
amusement
oh
yes
they
have
many
tricks
here
they
are
big
brains
eggheads
all
of
them
with
their
favorite
gadgets
they
put
you
through
a
machine
to
get
you
registered
on
a
tape
then
my
boy
you
can
not
get
outside
the
base
without
ringing
all
the
alarms
neat
eh
so
if
you
want
to
make
a
break
you
must
try
it
before
they
tape
you
ross
did
not
trust
kurt
but
he
was
listening
to
him
attentively
the
other
argument
sounded
convincing
to
one
whose
general
ignorance
of
science
led
him
to
be
as
fearful
of
the
whole
field
as
his
ancestors
had
been
of
black
magic
as
all
his
generation
he
was
conditioned
to
believe
that
all
kinds
of
weird
inventions
were
entirely
possible
and
probable
usually
to
be
produced
in
some
dim
future
but
perhaps
today
they
must
have
you
taped
ross
pointed
out
kurt
laughed
again
but
this
time
he
was
amused
they
believe
that
they
have
only
they
are
not
as
smart
as
they
believe
the
major
and
the
rest
including
millaird
no
i
have
a
fighting
chance
to
get
out
of
this
place
only
i
can
not
do
it
alone
that
is
why
i
have
been
waiting
for
them
to
bring
in
a
new
guy
i
could
get
to
before
they
had
him
pinned
down
for
good
you
are
tough
murdock
i
saw
your
record
and
betting
that
you
did
not
come
here
with
the
intention
of
staying
so
here
is
your
chance
to
go
along
with
one
who
knows
the
ropes
you
will
not
have
such
a
good
one
again
the
longer
kurt
talked
the
more
convincing
he
was
ross
lost
a
few
of
his
suspicions
it
was
true
that
he
had
come
prepared
to
run
at
the
first
possible
opportunity
and
if
kurt
had
everything
planned
so
much
the
better
of
course
it
was
possible
that
kurt
was
a
stool
pigeon
leading
him
on
as
a
test
but
that
was
a
chance
ross
would
have
to
take
look
here
murdock
maybe
you
think
it
easy
to
break
out
of
here
do
you
know
where
we
are
boy
we
near
enough
to
the
north
pole
as
makes
no
difference
are
you
going
to
leg
it
back
some
hundreds
of
miles
through
thick
ice
and
snow
a
nice
jaunt
if
you
make
it
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
not
without
plans
and
a
partner
who
knows
what
he
is
about
and
how
we
go
steal
one
of
those
atomjets
i
no
pilot
are
you
they
have
other
things
besides
here
this
place
is
strictly
even
the
do
not
set
down
too
often
for
fear
they
will
be
tracked
by
radar
where
have
you
been
boy
do
you
know
the
reds
are
circling
around
up
here
these
fellows
watch
for
red
activity
and
the
reds
watch
them
they
play
it
under
the
table
on
both
sides
we
get
our
supplies
overland
by
cats
cats
snow
sleds
like
tractors
the
other
answered
impatiently
our
stuff
is
dumped
miles
to
the
south
and
the
cats
go
down
once
a
month
to
bring
it
back
there
no
trick
to
driving
a
cat
and
they
tear
off
the
miles
how
many
miles
to
the
south
inquired
ross
skeptically
granted
kurt
was
speaking
the
truth
travel
over
an
arctic
wilderness
in
a
stolen
machine
was
risky
to
say
the
least
ross
had
only
a
very
vague
idea
of
the
polar
regions
but
he
was
sure
that
they
could
easily
swallow
up
the
unwary
forever
maybe
only
a
hundred
or
so
boy
but
i
have
more
than
one
plan
and
willing
to
risk
neck
do
you
think
i
intend
to
start
out
blind
there
was
that
of
course
ross
had
early
sized
up
his
visitor
as
one
who
was
first
of
all
interested
in
his
own
welfare
he
would
risk
his
neck
without
a
definite
plan
in
mind
well
what
do
you
say
murdock
are
you
with
me
or
not
i
take
some
time
to
chew
it
over
time
is
what
you
do
not
have
boy
tomorrow
they
will
tape
you
then
no
over
the
wall
for
you
suppose
you
tell
me
your
trick
for
fooling
the
tape
ross
countered
that
i
can
not
do
seeing
as
how
it
lies
in
the
way
my
brain
is
put
together
do
you
think
i
can
break
open
my
skull
and
hand
you
a
piece
of
what
is
inside
no
you
jump
with
me
tonight
or
else
i
must
wait
to
grab
the
next
one
who
lands
here
kurt
stood
up
his
last
words
were
spoken
and
ross
believed
he
meant
exactly
what
he
said
but
ross
hesitated
he
wanted
to
try
for
freedom
a
desire
fed
by
his
suspicions
of
what
was
going
on
here
he
neither
liked
nor
trusted
kurt
but
he
thought
he
understood
him
better
than
he
understood
ashe
or
the
others
also
with
kurt
he
was
sure
he
could
hold
his
own
it
would
be
the
kind
of
struggle
he
had
experienced
before
tonight
he
repeated
slowly
yes
tonight
there
was
new
eagerness
in
kurt
voice
for
he
sensed
that
the
other
was
wavering
i
have
been
preparing
for
a
long
time
but
there
must
be
two
of
us
we
have
to
take
turns
driving
the
cat
there
can
be
no
rest
until
we
are
far
to
the
south
i
tell
you
it
will
be
easy
there
are
food
caches
arranged
along
the
route
for
emergencies
i
have
a
map
marked
to
show
where
they
are
are
you
coming
when
ross
did
not
answer
at
once
the
other
moved
closer
to
him
remember
hardy
he
was
not
the
first
and
he
will
not
be
the
last
they
use
us
up
fast
here
that
is
why
they
brought
you
so
quickly
i
tell
you
it
is
better
to
take
your
chance
with
me
than
on
a
run
and
what
is
a
run
so
they
have
not
yet
briefed
you
well
a
run
is
a
little
jaunt
back
into
history
not
nice
comfortable
history
such
as
you
learned
out
of
a
book
when
you
were
a
little
kid
no
you
are
dropped
back
into
some
savage
time
before
history
that
impossible
yes
you
saw
those
two
big
blond
boys
tonight
did
you
not
why
do
you
suppose
they
sport
those
braids
because
they
are
taking
a
little
trip
into
the
time
when
wore
braids
and
carried
axes
big
enough
to
crack
a
man
open
and
hodaki
and
his
partner
ever
hear
of
the
tartars
maybe
you
have
not
but
once
they
nearly
overran
most
of
europe
ross
swallowed
he
now
knew
where
he
had
seen
braids
pictured
on
warriors
the
vikings
and
tartars
yes
that
movie
about
someone
named
khan
genghis
khan
but
to
return
into
the
past
was
impossible
yet
he
remembered
the
picture
he
had
watched
today
with
the
wolf
slayer
and
the
man
who
wore
skins
neither
of
these
was
of
his
own
world
could
kurt
be
telling
the
truth
ross
vivid
memory
of
the
scene
he
had
witnessed
made
kurt
story
more
convincing
suppose
you
get
sent
back
to
a
time
where
they
do
not
like
strangers
kurt
continued
then
you
are
in
for
it
that
is
what
happened
to
hardy
and
it
is
not
good
not
good
at
all
but
why
kurt
snorted
they
do
not
tell
you
until
just
before
you
take
your
first
run
i
do
not
want
to
know
why
but
i
do
know
that
i
am
not
going
to
be
sent
into
any
wilderness
where
a
savage
may
run
a
spear
through
me
just
to
prove
something
or
other
for
major
john
kelgarries
or
for
millaird
either
i
will
try
my
plan
first
the
urgency
in
kurt
protest
carried
ross
past
the
wavering
point
he
too
would
try
the
cat
he
was
only
familiar
with
this
time
and
world
he
had
no
desire
to
be
sent
into
another
one
once
ross
had
made
his
decision
kurt
hurried
him
into
action
knowledge
of
the
secret
procedures
at
the
base
proved
excellent
twice
they
were
halted
by
locked
doors
but
only
momentarily
for
kurt
had
a
tiny
gadget
concealed
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
which
had
only
to
be
held
over
a
latch
to
open
a
recalcitrant
door
there
was
enough
light
in
the
corridors
to
give
them
easy
passage
but
the
rooms
were
dark
and
twice
kurt
had
to
lead
ross
by
the
hand
avoiding
furniture
or
installations
with
the
surety
of
one
who
had
practiced
that
same
route
often
murdock
opinion
of
his
ability
underwent
several
upward
revisions
during
that
tour
and
he
began
to
believe
that
he
was
really
in
luck
to
have
found
such
a
partner
in
the
last
room
ross
willingly
followed
kurt
orders
to
put
on
the
fur
clothing
kurt
passed
to
him
the
fit
was
not
exact
but
he
surmised
that
kurt
had
chosen
as
well
as
possible
a
final
door
opened
and
they
stepped
out
into
the
polar
night
of
winter
kurt
mittened
hand
grasped
ross
pulling
him
along
together
they
pushed
back
the
door
of
a
hangar
shed
to
get
at
their
escape
vehicle
the
cat
was
a
strange
machine
but
ross
was
given
no
time
to
study
it
he
was
shoved
into
the
cockpit
a
bubble
covering
settled
down
over
them
closing
them
in
and
the
engine
came
to
life
under
kurt
urging
the
cat
must
be
traveling
at
its
best
pace
ross
thought
yet
the
crawl
which
took
them
away
from
the
mounded
snow
covering
the
base
seemed
hardly
better
than
a
man
could
make
afoot
for
a
short
time
kurt
headed
straight
away
from
the
starting
point
but
ross
soon
heard
him
counting
slowly
to
himself
as
if
he
were
timing
something
at
the
count
of
twenty
the
cat
swung
to
the
right
and
made
a
wide
half
circle
which
was
copied
at
the
next
count
of
twenty
by
a
similar
sweep
in
the
opposite
direction
after
this
pattern
had
been
repeated
for
six
turns
ross
found
it
difficult
to
guess
whether
they
had
ever
returned
to
their
first
course
when
kurt
stopped
counting
he
asked
why
the
dance
pattern
would
you
rather
be
scattered
in
little
pieces
all
over
the
landscape
the
other
snapped
the
base
does
need
fences
two
miles
high
to
keep
us
in
or
others
out
they
take
other
precautions
you
should
thank
fortune
we
got
through
that
first
mine
field
without
blowing
ross
swallowed
but
he
refused
to
let
kurt
know
that
he
was
rattled
so
it
is
as
easy
to
get
away
as
you
said
shut
up
kurt
began
counting
again
and
ross
had
some
cold
apprehensive
moments
in
which
to
reflect
upon
the
folly
of
quick
decisions
and
wonder
bleakly
why
he
had
not
thought
things
through
before
he
leaped
again
they
sketched
a
weaving
pattern
in
the
snow
but
this
time
the
arcs
formed
acute
angles
ross
glanced
now
and
then
at
the
intent
man
at
the
wheel
how
had
kurt
managed
to
memorize
this
route
his
urge
to
escape
the
base
must
certainly
be
a
strong
one
back
and
forth
they
crawled
gaining
only
a
few
yards
in
each
of
those
angled
strikes
to
right
or
left
good
thing
these
cats
are
atomic
powered
kurt
commented
during
one
of
the
intervals
between
mine
fields
we
run
out
of
fuel
otherwise
ross
fought
down
the
impulse
to
move
his
feet
away
from
any
possible
contact
point
with
the
engine
these
machines
must
be
safe
to
ride
in
but
the
bogy
of
radiation
was
frightening
luckily
kurt
was
now
back
to
a
straight
track
with
no
more
weaving
we
are
out
kurt
said
with
exultation
but
he
added
no
more
than
just
the
reassurance
of
their
escape
the
cat
crawled
on
to
ross
eyes
there
was
no
trail
to
follow
no
guideposts
yet
kurt
steered
ahead
with
confidence
a
little
later
he
pulled
to
a
stop
and
said
to
ross
we
have
to
drive
turn
and
turn
about
your
turn
ross
was
dubious
well
i
can
drive
a
car
but
this
is
fool
proof
kurt
caught
him
up
the
worst
was
getting
through
the
mine
fields
and
we
are
out
of
that
now
see
here
his
hand
made
a
shadow
on
the
lighted
instrument
panel
this
will
keep
you
straight
if
you
can
steer
a
car
you
can
steer
this
watch
he
started
up
again
and
once
more
swung
the
cat
to
the
left
a
light
on
the
panel
began
to
blink
at
a
rate
which
increased
rapidly
as
they
veered
farther
away
from
their
original
course
see
you
keep
that
light
steady
and
you
are
on
course
if
it
begins
to
blink
you
cast
about
until
it
steadies
again
simple
enough
for
a
baby
take
over
and
see
it
was
hard
to
change
places
in
the
sealed
cabin
of
the
cat
but
they
were
successful
and
ross
took
the
wheel
gingerly
following
directions
he
started
ahead
his
eyes
focused
on
the
light
rather
than
the
white
expanse
before
him
and
after
a
few
minutes
of
strain
he
caught
the
hang
of
it
as
kurt
had
promised
it
was
very
simple
after
watching
him
for
a
while
his
instructor
gave
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
and
settled
down
for
a
nap
once
the
first
excitement
of
driving
the
cat
wore
off
the
operation
tended
to
become
monotonous
ross
caught
himself
yawning
but
he
kept
at
his
post
with
dogged
stubbornness
this
had
been
kurt
game
all
the
way
through
so
far
and
he
was
certainly
not
going
to
resign
his
first
chance
to
show
that
he
could
be
of
use
also
if
there
had
only
been
some
break
in
the
eternal
snow
some
passing
light
or
goal
to
be
seen
ahead
it
would
not
have
been
so
bad
finally
every
now
and
then
ross
had
to
jiggle
off
course
just
enough
so
that
the
warning
blink
of
light
would
alert
him
and
keep
him
from
falling
asleep
he
was
unaware
that
kurt
had
awakened
during
one
of
those
maneuvers
until
the
other
spoke
your
own
private
alarm
clock
murdock
okay
i
do
not
quarrel
with
anyone
who
uses
his
head
but
you
had
better
get
some
or
we
will
not
keep
rolling
ross
was
too
tired
to
protest
they
changed
places
and
he
curled
up
as
best
he
could
on
his
small
share
of
seat
only
now
that
he
was
free
to
sleep
he
realized
he
no
longer
wanted
to
kurt
must
have
thought
ross
had
fallen
asleep
for
after
perhaps
two
miles
of
steady
grinding
along
he
moved
cautiously
behind
the
wheel
ross
saw
by
the
trace
of
light
from
the
instrument
panel
that
his
companion
was
digging
into
the
breast
of
his
parka
to
bring
out
a
small
object
which
he
held
against
the
wheel
of
the
cat
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
tapped
out
an
irregular
rhythm
to
ross
the
action
made
no
sense
but
he
did
not
miss
the
other
sigh
of
relief
as
he
restored
his
treasure
to
hiding
once
more
as
if
some
difficult
task
was
now
behind
him
shortly
afterward
the
cat
ground
to
a
stop
and
ross
sat
up
rubbing
his
eyes
what
the
matter
engine
trouble
kurt
had
folded
his
arms
across
the
wheel
no
it
is
just
that
we
are
to
wait
here
wait
for
what
kelgarries
to
come
along
and
pick
us
up
kurt
laughed
the
major
how
i
wish
that
he
arrive
presently
what
a
surprise
he
would
receive
not
two
little
mice
to
be
put
back
into
their
cages
but
the
tiger
cat
all
claws
and
fangs
ross
sat
up
straighter
this
now
had
the
bad
smell
of
a
frame
a
frame
with
himself
planted
right
in
the
middle
he
figured
out
the
possibilities
and
came
up
with
an
answer
which
would
smear
ross
murdock
all
over
any
map
if
kurt
were
waiting
to
meet
friends
out
here
they
could
only
be
of
one
brand
for
most
of
his
short
life
ross
had
been
engaged
in
a
private
war
against
the
restrictions
imposed
upon
him
by
a
set
of
legal
rules
to
which
something
within
him
would
not
conform
and
he
had
during
those
same
years
filled
with
attacks
retreats
and
strategic
maneuvering
formulated
a
code
of
rules
by
which
to
play
his
dangerous
game
he
had
not
murdered
and
he
would
never
follow
the
path
kurt
took
to
one
who
was
supremely
impatient
of
restraint
the
methods
and
aims
of
employers
were
not
only
impossibly
fantastic
and
illogical
they
were
to
be
opposed
to
the
last
ounce
of
any
man
energy
your
friends
late
he
tried
to
sound
casual
not
yet
and
if
you
now
plan
to
play
the
hero
murdock
think
better
of
it
kurt
tone
held
the
crack
of
an
order
that
note
ross
had
so
much
disliked
in
the
major
voice
this
is
an
operation
which
has
been
most
carefully
planned
and
upon
which
a
great
deal
depends
no
one
shall
spoil
it
for
us
now
the
reds
planted
you
on
the
project
eh
ross
wanted
to
keep
the
other
talking
to
give
himself
a
chance
to
think
and
this
was
one
time
he
had
to
think
clearly
and
with
speed
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
tell
you
the
sad
tale
of
my
life
murdock
and
you
would
doubtless
find
much
of
it
boring
if
you
wish
to
continue
to
live
for
a
while
at
least
you
will
remain
quiet
and
do
as
you
are
told
kurt
must
be
armed
for
he
would
not
be
so
confident
unless
he
had
a
weapon
he
could
now
turn
on
ross
on
the
other
hand
if
what
ross
guessed
were
true
this
the
time
to
play
the
hero
when
there
was
only
kurt
to
handle
better
to
be
a
dead
hero
than
a
live
captive
in
the
hands
of
kurt
dear
friends
across
the
pole
without
warning
ross
threw
his
body
to
the
left
striving
to
pin
kurt
against
the
driver
side
of
the
cabin
his
hands
clawing
at
the
fur
ruff
bordering
the
other
hood
trying
for
a
throat
hold
perhaps
it
was
kurt
which
betrayed
him
and
left
him
open
to
a
surprise
attack
he
struggled
hard
to
bring
up
his
arm
but
both
his
weight
and
ross
held
him
tight
ross
caught
at
his
wrist
noticing
a
gleam
of
metal
they
threshed
about
the
bulkiness
of
the
fur
clothing
hampering
them
ross
wondered
fleetingly
why
the
other
had
not
made
sure
of
him
earlier
as
it
was
he
fought
with
all
his
vigor
to
keep
kurt
immobile
to
try
and
knock
him
out
with
a
lucky
blow
in
the
end
kurt
aided
in
his
own
defeat
when
ross
relaxed
somewhat
the
other
pushed
against
him
only
to
have
ross
flinch
to
one
side
kurt
could
not
stop
himself
and
his
head
cracked
against
the
wheel
of
the
cat
he
went
limp
ross
made
the
most
of
the
next
few
moments
he
brought
his
belt
from
under
his
parka
twisting
it
around
kurt
wrists
with
no
gentleness
then
he
wriggled
about
changing
places
with
the
unconscious
man
he
had
no
idea
of
where
to
go
but
he
was
sure
he
was
going
to
get
away
at
the
cat
top
speed
from
that
point
and
with
that
in
mind
and
only
a
limited
knowledge
of
how
to
manage
the
machine
ross
started
up
and
turned
in
a
wide
circle
until
he
was
sure
the
cat
was
headed
in
the
opposite
direction
the
light
which
had
guided
them
was
still
on
would
reversing
its
process
take
him
back
to
the
base
lost
in
the
immensity
of
the
cold
wilderness
he
made
the
only
choice
possible
and
gunned
the
cat
again
chapter
once
again
ross
sat
waiting
for
others
to
decide
his
future
he
was
as
outwardly
composed
as
he
had
been
in
judge
rawle
chambers
but
inwardly
he
was
far
more
apprehensive
out
in
the
wilderness
of
the
polar
night
he
had
had
no
chance
for
escape
heading
away
from
rendezvous
ross
had
run
straight
into
the
search
party
from
the
base
had
seen
in
action
that
mechanical
hound
that
kurt
had
said
they
would
put
on
the
fugitives
trail
the
thing
which
would
have
gone
on
hunting
them
until
its
metal
rusted
into
powder
kurt
boasted
immunity
to
that
tracker
had
not
been
as
good
as
he
had
believed
though
it
had
won
them
a
start
ross
did
not
know
just
how
much
it
might
count
in
his
favor
that
he
had
been
on
his
way
back
with
kurt
a
prisoner
in
the
cat
as
his
waiting
hours
wore
on
he
began
to
think
it
might
mean
very
little
indeed
this
time
there
was
no
show
on
the
wall
of
his
cell
nothing
but
time
to
think
too
much
of
that
and
no
pleasant
things
to
think
about
but
he
had
learned
one
valuable
lesson
on
that
cold
expedition
kelgarries
and
the
others
at
the
base
were
the
most
formidable
opponents
he
had
ever
met
and
all
the
balance
of
luck
and
equipment
lay
on
their
side
of
the
scales
ross
was
now
convinced
that
there
could
be
no
escape
from
this
base
he
had
been
impressed
by
kurt
preparations
knowing
that
some
of
them
were
far
beyond
anything
he
himself
could
have
devised
he
did
not
doubt
that
kurt
had
come
here
fully
prepared
with
every
ingenious
device
the
reds
could
supply
at
least
kurt
friends
had
had
a
rude
welcome
when
they
did
arrive
at
the
meeting
place
kelgarries
had
heard
ross
out
and
then
had
sent
ahead
a
team
before
ross
party
had
reached
the
base
there
had
been
a
blast
which
split
the
arctic
night
wide
open
and
kurt
conscious
by
then
had
shown
his
only
sign
of
emotion
when
he
realized
what
it
meant
the
door
to
ross
cell
room
clicked
and
he
swung
his
feet
to
the
floor
sitting
up
on
his
bunk
to
face
his
future
this
time
he
made
no
attempt
to
put
on
an
act
he
was
not
in
the
least
sorry
he
had
tried
to
get
away
had
kurt
been
on
the
level
it
would
have
been
a
bright
play
that
kurt
was
not
was
just
plain
bad
luck
kelgarries
and
ashe
entered
and
at
the
sight
of
ashe
the
taut
feeling
in
ross
middle
loosened
a
bit
the
major
might
come
by
himself
to
pass
sentence
but
he
would
not
bring
ashe
along
if
the
sentence
was
a
really
harsh
one
you
got
off
to
a
bad
start
here
murdock
the
major
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
wall
shelf
which
doubled
as
a
table
you
going
to
have
a
second
chance
so
consider
yourself
lucky
we
know
you
are
another
plant
of
our
enemies
a
fact
that
saves
your
neck
do
you
have
anything
to
add
to
your
story
no
sir
he
was
not
adding
that
sir
to
curry
any
favor
it
came
naturally
when
one
answered
kelgarries
but
you
have
some
questions
ross
met
that
with
the
truth
a
lot
of
them
why
do
you
ask
them
ross
smiled
thinly
an
expression
far
removed
and
years
older
than
his
bashful
boy
grin
of
the
shy
act
a
wise
guy
does
spill
his
ignorance
he
uses
his
eyes
and
ears
and
keeps
his
trap
shut
and
goes
off
half
cocked
as
a
result
the
major
added
i
think
you
would
have
enjoyed
the
company
of
kurt
paymaster
i
did
know
about
him
then
not
when
i
left
here
yes
and
when
you
discovered
the
truth
you
took
steps
why
for
the
first
time
there
was
a
trace
of
feeling
in
the
major
voice
because
i
do
like
the
on
his
side
of
the
fence
that
single
fact
has
saved
your
neck
this
time
murdock
step
out
of
line
once
more
and
nothing
will
help
you
but
just
so
we
wo
have
to
worry
about
that
suppose
you
ask
a
few
of
those
questions
how
much
of
what
kurt
fed
me
is
the
truth
ross
blurted
out
i
mean
all
that
stuff
about
shooting
back
in
time
all
of
it
the
major
said
it
so
quietly
that
it
carried
complete
conviction
but
why
how
you
have
us
on
a
spot
murdock
because
of
your
little
expedition
we
have
to
tell
you
more
now
than
we
tell
any
of
our
men
before
the
final
briefing
listen
and
then
forget
all
of
it
except
what
applies
to
the
job
at
hand
the
reds
shot
up
sputnik
and
then
muttnik
when
years
ago
we
got
up
our
answers
a
little
later
there
were
a
couple
of
spectacular
crashes
on
the
moon
then
that
space
station
that
stay
in
orbit
after
that
stalemate
in
the
past
quarter
century
had
no
voyages
into
space
nothing
that
was
prophesied
too
many
bugs
too
many
costly
failures
finally
we
began
to
get
hints
of
something
big
bigger
than
any
football
roaming
the
heavens
any
discovery
in
science
comes
about
by
steps
it
can
be
traced
back
through
those
steps
by
another
scientist
but
suppose
you
were
confronted
by
a
result
which
apparently
had
been
produced
without
any
preliminaries
what
would
be
your
guess
concerning
it
ross
stared
at
the
major
although
he
did
see
what
all
this
had
to
do
with
he
sensed
that
kelgarries
was
waiting
for
a
serious
answer
that
somehow
ross
would
be
judged
by
his
reply
either
that
the
steps
were
kept
strictly
secret
he
said
slowly
or
that
the
result
did
rightfully
belong
to
the
man
who
said
he
discovered
it
for
the
first
time
the
major
regarded
him
with
approval
suppose
this
discovery
was
vital
to
your
life
what
would
you
do
try
to
find
the
source
there
you
have
it
within
the
past
five
years
our
friends
across
the
way
have
come
up
with
three
such
discoveries
one
we
were
able
to
trace
duplicate
and
use
with
a
few
refinements
of
our
own
the
other
two
remain
rootless
yet
they
are
linked
with
the
first
we
are
now
attempting
to
solve
that
problem
and
the
time
grows
late
for
some
reason
though
the
reds
now
have
their
super
super
gadgets
they
are
not
yet
ready
to
use
them
sometimes
the
things
work
and
sometimes
they
fail
everything
points
to
the
fact
that
the
reds
are
now
experimenting
with
discoveries
which
are
not
basically
their
own
where
did
they
get
them
from
another
world
ross
imagination
came
to
life
had
a
successful
space
voyage
been
kept
secret
had
there
been
contact
made
with
another
intelligent
race
in
a
way
it
another
world
but
the
world
of
time
not
space
seven
years
ago
we
got
a
man
out
of
east
berlin
he
was
almost
dead
but
he
lived
long
enough
to
record
on
tape
some
amazing
data
so
wild
it
was
almost
dismissed
as
the
ravings
of
delirium
but
that
was
after
sputnik
and
we
did
dare
disregard
any
hints
from
the
other
side
of
the
iron
curtain
so
the
recording
was
turned
over
to
our
scientists
who
proved
it
had
a
core
of
truth
time
travel
has
been
written
up
in
fiction
it
has
been
discussed
otherwise
as
an
impossibility
then
we
discover
that
the
reds
have
it
working
you
mean
they
go
into
the
future
and
bring
back
machines
to
use
now
the
major
shook
his
head
not
the
future
the
past
was
this
an
elaborate
joke
somewhat
heatedly
ross
snapped
out
the
answer
to
that
look
here
i
know
i
have
the
education
of
your
big
brains
but
i
do
know
that
the
farther
back
you
go
into
history
the
simpler
things
are
we
ride
in
cars
only
a
hundred
years
ago
men
drove
horses
we
have
guns
go
back
a
little
and
you
find
them
waving
swords
and
shooting
guys
with
bows
and
arrows
those
that
do
wear
tin
plate
on
them
to
stop
being
punctured
only
they
were
after
all
commented
ashe
look
at
agincourt
and
remember
what
arrows
did
to
the
french
knights
in
armor
ross
disregarded
the
interruption
anyway
he
stuck
doggedly
to
his
point
the
farther
back
you
go
the
simpler
things
are
how
are
the
reds
going
to
find
anything
in
history
we
ca
beat
today
that
is
a
point
which
has
baffled
us
for
several
years
now
the
major
returned
only
it
is
not
they
are
going
to
find
it
but
because
somewhere
in
the
past
of
this
world
they
have
contacted
a
civilization
able
to
produce
weapons
and
ideas
so
advanced
as
to
baffle
our
experts
we
have
to
find
that
source
and
either
mine
it
ourselves
or
close
it
off
as
yet
we
still
trying
to
find
it
ross
shook
his
head
it
must
be
a
long
way
back
those
guys
who
discover
tombs
and
dig
up
old
cities
could
they
give
you
some
hints
would
a
civilization
like
that
have
left
something
we
could
find
today
it
depends
ashe
remarked
upon
the
type
of
civilization
the
egyptians
built
in
stone
grandly
they
used
tools
and
weapons
of
copper
bronze
and
stone
and
they
were
considerate
enough
to
operate
in
a
dry
climate
which
preserved
relics
well
the
cities
of
the
fertile
crescent
built
in
mud
brick
and
used
stone
copper
and
bronze
tools
they
also
chose
a
portion
of
the
world
where
climate
was
a
factor
in
keeping
their
memory
green
the
greeks
built
in
stone
wrote
their
books
kept
their
history
to
bequeath
it
to
their
successors
and
so
did
the
romans
and
on
this
side
of
the
ocean
the
incas
the
mayas
the
unknown
races
before
them
and
the
aztecs
of
mexico
all
built
in
stone
and
worked
in
metal
and
stone
and
metal
survive
but
what
if
there
had
been
an
early
people
who
used
plastics
and
brittle
alloys
who
had
no
desire
to
build
permanent
buildings
whose
tools
and
artifacts
were
meant
to
wear
out
quickly
perhaps
for
economic
reasons
what
would
they
leave
us
considering
perhaps
that
an
ice
age
had
intervened
between
their
time
and
ours
with
glaciers
to
grind
into
dust
what
little
they
did
possess
there
is
evidence
that
the
poles
of
our
world
have
changed
and
that
this
northern
region
was
once
close
to
being
tropical
any
catastrophe
violent
enough
to
bring
about
a
switch
in
the
poles
of
this
planet
might
well
have
wiped
out
all
traces
of
a
civilization
no
matter
how
superior
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
such
a
people
must
have
existed
but
we
must
find
them
and
ashe
is
a
convert
from
the
skeptics
the
major
slipped
down
from
his
perch
on
the
wall
shelf
he
is
an
archaeologist
one
of
your
tomb
discoverers
and
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
we
must
do
our
hunting
in
time
earlier
than
the
first
pyramid
earlier
than
the
first
group
of
farmers
who
settled
by
the
tigris
river
but
we
have
to
let
the
enemy
guide
us
to
it
that
where
you
come
in
why
me
that
is
a
question
to
which
our
psychologists
are
still
trying
to
find
the
answer
my
young
friend
it
seems
that
the
majority
of
the
people
of
the
several
nations
linked
together
in
this
project
have
become
too
civilized
the
reactions
of
most
men
to
given
sets
of
circumstances
have
become
set
in
regular
patterns
and
they
can
not
break
that
conditioning
or
if
personal
danger
forces
them
to
change
those
patterns
they
are
afterward
so
adrift
they
can
not
function
at
their
highest
potential
teach
a
man
to
kill
as
in
war
and
then
you
have
to
recondition
him
later
but
during
these
same
wars
we
also
develop
another
type
he
is
the
born
commando
the
secret
agent
the
expendable
man
who
lives
on
action
there
are
not
many
of
this
kind
and
they
are
potent
weapons
in
peacetime
that
particular
collection
of
emotions
nerve
and
skills
becomes
a
menace
to
the
very
society
he
has
fought
to
preserve
during
a
war
he
is
pressured
by
the
peaceful
environment
into
becoming
a
criminal
or
a
misfit
the
men
we
send
out
from
here
to
explore
the
past
are
not
only
given
the
best
training
we
can
possibly
supply
for
them
but
they
are
all
of
the
type
once
heralded
as
the
frontiersman
history
is
sentimental
about
that
type
when
he
is
safely
dead
but
the
present
finds
him
difficult
to
live
with
our
time
agents
are
misfits
in
the
modern
world
because
their
inherited
abilities
are
born
out
of
season
now
they
must
be
young
enough
and
possess
a
certain
brand
of
intelligence
to
take
the
stiff
training
and
to
adapt
and
they
must
pass
our
tests
do
you
understand
ross
nodded
you
want
crooks
because
they
are
crooks
no
not
because
they
are
crooks
but
because
they
are
misfits
in
their
time
and
place
do
i
beg
of
you
murdock
think
that
we
are
operating
a
penal
institution
here
you
would
never
have
been
recruited
if
you
had
tested
out
to
suit
us
but
the
man
who
may
be
labeled
murderer
in
his
own
period
might
rank
as
a
hero
in
another
an
extreme
example
but
true
when
we
train
a
man
he
not
only
can
survive
in
the
period
to
which
he
is
sent
but
he
can
also
pass
as
a
native
born
in
that
era
what
about
hardy
the
major
gazed
into
space
there
is
no
operation
which
is
foolproof
we
have
never
said
that
we
do
run
into
trouble
or
that
there
is
no
danger
in
this
we
have
to
deal
with
both
natives
of
different
times
and
if
we
are
lucky
and
hit
a
hot
run
with
the
reds
they
suspect
that
we
are
casting
about
hunting
their
trail
they
managed
to
plant
kurt
vogel
on
us
he
had
an
almost
perfect
cover
and
conditioning
now
you
have
it
straight
murdock
you
satisfy
our
tests
and
you
be
given
a
chance
to
say
yes
or
no
before
your
first
run
if
you
say
no
and
refuse
duty
it
means
you
must
become
an
exile
and
stay
here
no
man
who
has
gone
through
our
training
can
return
to
normal
life
there
is
too
much
chance
of
his
being
picked
up
and
sweated
by
the
opposition
never
the
major
shrugged
this
may
be
a
operation
we
hope
not
but
there
is
no
way
of
telling
now
you
will
be
in
exile
until
we
either
find
what
we
want
or
fail
entirely
that
is
the
last
card
i
have
to
lay
on
the
table
he
stretched
you
slated
for
training
tomorrow
think
it
over
and
then
let
us
know
your
answer
when
the
time
comes
meanwhile
you
are
to
be
teamed
with
ashe
who
will
see
to
putting
you
through
the
course
it
was
a
big
hunk
to
swallow
but
once
down
ross
found
it
digestible
the
training
opened
up
a
whole
new
world
to
him
judo
and
wrestling
were
easy
enough
to
absorb
and
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
workouts
but
the
patient
hours
of
archery
practice
the
strict
instruction
in
the
use
of
a
bronze
dagger
were
more
demanding
the
mastering
of
one
new
language
and
then
another
the
intensive
drill
in
unfamiliar
social
customs
the
memorizing
of
strict
taboos
and
ethics
were
difficult
ross
learned
to
keep
records
in
knots
on
hide
thongs
and
was
inducted
into
the
art
of
primitive
bargaining
and
trade
he
came
to
understand
the
worth
of
a
tin
ingot
compared
to
a
string
of
amber
beads
and
some
white
furs
he
now
understood
why
he
had
been
shown
a
traders
caravan
during
that
first
encounter
with
the
purpose
behind
operation
retrograde
during
the
training
days
his
feeling
toward
ashe
changed
materially
a
man
could
not
work
so
closely
with
another
and
continue
to
resent
his
attitude
either
he
blew
up
entirely
or
he
learned
to
adjust
his
awe
at
ashe
vast
amount
of
practical
knowledge
freely
offered
to
serve
his
own
blundering
ignorance
created
a
respect
for
the
man
which
might
have
become
friendship
had
ashe
ever
relaxed
his
own
shield
of
impersonal
efficiency
ross
did
not
try
to
breach
the
barrier
between
them
mainly
because
he
was
sure
that
the
reason
for
it
was
the
fact
that
he
was
a
volunteer
it
gave
him
an
odd
new
feeling
he
avoided
trying
to
analyze
he
had
always
had
a
kind
of
pride
in
his
record
now
he
had
begun
to
wish
sometimes
that
it
was
a
record
of
a
different
type
men
came
and
went
hodaki
and
his
partner
disappeared
as
did
jansen
and
his
one
lost
track
of
time
within
that
underground
warren
which
was
the
base
ross
gradually
discovered
that
the
whole
establishment
covered
a
large
area
under
an
external
crust
of
ice
and
snow
there
were
laboratories
a
hospital
armories
which
stocked
weapons
usually
seen
only
in
museums
but
which
here
were
free
of
any
signs
of
age
and
ready
for
use
there
were
libraries
with
mile
upon
mile
of
tape
recordings
as
well
as
films
ross
could
not
understand
everything
he
heard
and
saw
but
he
soaked
up
all
he
could
so
that
once
or
twice
when
drifting
off
to
sleep
at
night
he
thought
of
himself
as
a
sponge
which
had
nearly
reached
its
total
limit
of
absorption
he
learned
to
wear
naturally
the
clumsy
he
had
seen
on
the
wolf
slayer
to
shave
with
practiced
assurance
using
a
bronze
razor
to
eat
strange
food
until
he
relished
the
taste
making
lesson
time
serve
a
double
duty
he
lay
under
sunlamps
while
listening
to
tape
recordings
until
his
skin
darkened
to
a
weathered
hue
resembling
ashe
there
was
always
talk
to
listen
to
important
talk
which
he
was
afraid
to
miss
bronze
ashe
weighed
a
dagger
in
his
hand
one
day
its
hilt
made
of
dark
horn
studded
with
an
intricate
pattern
of
tiny
golden
nail
heads
had
a
gleam
not
unlike
that
of
the
blade
do
you
know
murdock
that
bronze
can
be
tougher
than
steel
if
it
was
that
iron
is
so
much
more
plentiful
and
easier
to
work
we
might
never
have
come
out
of
the
bronze
age
iron
is
cheaper
and
easier
found
and
when
the
first
smith
learned
to
work
it
an
end
came
to
one
way
of
life
a
beginning
to
another
yes
bronze
is
important
to
us
here
and
so
are
the
men
who
worked
it
smiths
were
sacred
in
the
old
days
we
know
that
they
made
a
secret
of
their
trade
which
overrode
the
bounds
of
district
tribe
and
race
a
smith
was
welcome
in
any
village
his
person
safe
on
the
road
in
fact
the
roads
themselves
were
under
the
protection
of
the
gods
there
was
peace
on
them
for
all
wayfarers
the
land
was
wide
then
and
it
was
empty
the
tribes
were
few
and
small
and
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
the
hunter
the
farmer
the
trader
life
was
not
such
a
scramble
of
man
against
man
but
rather
of
man
against
nature
no
wars
asked
ross
then
why
the
drill
wars
were
small
affairs
disputes
between
family
clans
or
tribes
as
for
the
bow
there
were
formidable
things
in
the
forests
giant
animals
wolves
wild
boars
cave
bears
ashe
sighed
with
weary
patience
get
it
through
your
head
murdock
that
history
is
much
longer
than
you
seem
to
think
cave
bears
and
the
use
of
bronze
weapons
do
not
overlap
no
you
will
have
to
go
back
maybe
several
thousand
years
earlier
and
then
hunt
your
bear
with
a
spear
in
your
hand
if
you
are
fool
enough
to
try
it
or
take
a
rifle
with
you
ross
made
a
suggestion
he
had
longed
to
voice
for
some
time
ashe
rounded
on
him
swiftly
and
ross
knew
him
well
enough
now
to
realize
that
he
was
seriously
displeased
that
is
just
what
you
do
do
murdock
not
from
this
base
as
you
well
know
by
now
you
take
no
weapon
from
here
which
is
not
designed
for
the
period
in
which
your
run
lies
just
as
you
do
not
become
embroiled
while
on
that
run
in
any
action
which
might
influence
the
course
of
history
ross
went
on
polishing
the
blade
he
held
what
would
happen
if
someone
did
break
that
rule
ashe
put
down
the
dagger
he
had
been
playing
with
we
do
know
we
just
do
know
so
far
we
have
operated
in
the
fringe
territory
keeping
away
from
any
district
with
a
history
which
we
can
trace
accurately
maybe
some
day
his
eyes
were
on
a
wall
of
weapon
racks
he
plainly
did
not
see
maybe
some
day
we
can
stand
and
watch
the
rise
of
the
pyramids
witness
the
march
of
alexander
armies
but
not
yet
we
stay
away
from
history
and
we
are
sure
that
the
reds
are
doing
the
same
it
has
become
the
old
problem
once
presented
by
the
atom
bomb
nobody
wants
to
upset
the
balance
and
take
the
consequences
let
us
find
their
outpost
and
we
withdraw
our
men
from
all
the
other
runs
at
once
what
makes
everyone
so
sure
that
they
have
an
outpost
somewhere
could
they
be
working
right
at
the
main
source
sir
they
could
but
for
some
reason
they
are
not
as
for
how
we
know
that
much
it
information
received
ashe
smiled
thinly
no
the
source
is
much
farther
back
in
time
than
their
halfway
post
but
if
we
find
that
then
we
can
trail
them
so
we
plant
men
in
suitable
eras
and
hope
for
the
best
that
a
good
weapon
you
have
there
murdock
are
you
willing
to
wear
it
in
earnest
the
inflection
in
that
question
caught
ross
full
attention
his
gray
eyes
met
those
blue
ones
this
was
it
at
long
last
right
away
ashe
picked
up
a
belt
of
bronze
plates
strung
together
with
chains
a
twin
to
that
ross
had
seen
worn
by
the
wolf
slayer
he
held
it
out
to
the
younger
man
you
can
take
your
trial
run
any
time
tomorrow
ross
drew
a
deeper
breath
where
to
when
an
island
which
will
later
be
britain
when
about
two
thousand
beaker
traders
were
beginning
to
open
their
stations
there
this
is
your
graduation
exercise
murdock
ross
fitted
the
blade
he
had
been
polishing
into
the
wooden
sheath
on
the
belt
if
you
say
i
can
do
it
i
willing
to
try
he
caught
that
glance
ashe
shot
at
him
but
he
could
not
read
its
meaning
annoyance
impatience
he
was
still
puzzling
over
it
when
the
other
turned
abruptly
and
left
him
alone
chapter
he
might
have
said
yes
but
that
did
mean
ross
discovered
that
he
was
to
be
shipped
off
at
once
to
early
britain
ashe
tomorrow
proved
to
be
several
days
later
the
cover
was
that
of
a
beaker
trader
and
ross
impersonation
was
checked
again
and
again
by
experts
making
sure
that
the
last
detail
was
correct
and
that
no
suspicion
of
a
tribesman
no
mistake
on
ross
part
would
betray
him
the
beaker
people
were
an
excellent
choice
for
infiltration
they
were
not
a
closely
knit
clan
suspicious
of
strangers
and
alert
to
any
deviation
from
the
norm
as
more
tribes
might
be
for
they
lived
by
trade
leaving
to
ross
own
time
the
mark
of
their
empire
in
the
beakers
found
in
graves
scattered
in
clusters
of
a
handful
or
so
from
the
rhineland
to
spain
and
from
the
balkans
to
britain
they
did
not
depend
only
upon
the
taboo
of
the
trade
road
for
their
safety
for
the
beakermen
were
master
bowmen
a
roving
people
they
pushed
into
new
territory
to
establish
posts
living
amicably
among
peoples
with
far
different
customs
the
downs
farmers
horse
herders
fisherfolk
with
ashe
ross
passed
a
last
inspection
their
hair
had
not
grown
long
enough
to
require
braiding
but
they
did
have
enough
to
hold
it
back
from
their
faces
with
hide
headbands
the
of
coarse
material
duplicating
samples
brought
from
the
past
were
harsh
to
the
skin
and
poorly
fitting
but
the
workmanship
of
their
bronze
belts
the
sleek
bow
guards
strapped
to
their
wrists
and
the
bows
themselves
approached
fine
art
ashe
round
cloak
was
the
blue
of
a
master
trader
and
he
wore
wealth
in
a
necklace
of
polished
teeth
alternating
with
amber
beads
ross
more
modest
position
in
the
tribe
was
indicated
not
only
by
his
cloak
but
by
the
fact
that
his
personal
jewelry
consisted
only
of
a
copper
bracelet
and
a
cloak
pin
with
a
jet
head
he
had
no
idea
how
the
time
transition
was
to
be
made
nor
how
one
might
step
from
the
polar
regions
of
the
western
hemisphere
to
the
island
of
britain
lying
off
the
eastern
and
it
was
a
complicated
business
as
he
discovered
the
transition
itself
was
a
fairly
simple
though
disturbing
process
one
walked
a
short
corridor
and
stood
for
an
instant
on
a
plate
while
the
light
centered
there
curled
about
in
a
solid
core
shutting
one
off
from
floor
and
wall
ross
gasped
for
breath
as
the
air
was
sucked
out
of
his
lungs
he
experienced
a
moment
of
deathly
sickness
with
the
sensation
of
being
lost
in
nothingness
then
he
breathed
again
and
looked
through
the
dying
wall
of
light
to
where
ashe
waited
quick
and
easy
as
the
trip
through
time
had
been
the
journey
to
britain
was
something
else
there
could
be
only
one
transfer
point
if
the
secret
was
to
be
preserved
but
men
from
that
point
must
be
moved
swiftly
and
secretly
to
their
appointed
stations
ross
knowing
the
strict
rules
concerning
the
transportation
of
objects
from
one
time
to
another
wondered
how
that
travel
could
be
effected
after
all
they
could
not
spend
months
or
even
years
getting
across
continents
and
seas
the
answer
was
ingenious
three
days
after
they
had
stepped
through
the
barrier
of
time
at
the
outpost
ross
and
ashe
balanced
on
the
rounded
back
of
a
whale
it
was
a
whale
which
would
deceive
anyone
who
did
not
test
its
hide
with
a
harpoon
and
whalers
with
harpoons
large
enough
to
trouble
such
a
monster
were
yet
well
in
the
future
ashe
slid
a
dugout
into
the
water
and
ross
climbed
into
that
unsteady
craft
holding
it
against
the
side
of
the
disguised
sub
until
his
partner
joined
him
the
day
misty
and
drizzling
made
the
shore
they
aimed
for
a
line
across
the
water
with
a
shiver
born
of
more
than
cold
ross
dipped
his
paddle
and
helped
ashe
send
their
crude
boat
toward
that
strip
of
land
there
was
no
real
dawn
the
sky
lightened
somewhat
but
the
drizzle
continued
green
patches
showed
among
the
trees
back
from
the
beach
but
the
countryside
facing
them
gave
an
impression
of
untamed
wilderness
ross
knew
from
his
briefing
that
the
whole
of
britain
was
as
yet
only
sparsely
settled
the
first
wave
of
to
establish
villages
had
been
joined
by
other
invaders
who
built
massive
tombs
and
had
an
elaborate
religion
small
had
been
linked
from
hill
to
hill
by
trackways
there
were
factories
which
turned
out
in
bulk
such
fine
flint
weapons
and
tools
that
a
thriving
industry
was
in
full
operation
not
yet
having
been
superseded
by
the
metal
imported
by
the
beaker
merchants
bronze
was
still
so
rare
and
costly
that
only
the
head
man
of
a
village
could
hope
to
own
one
of
the
long
daggers
even
the
arrowheads
in
ross
quiver
were
chipped
of
flint
they
drew
the
dugout
well
up
onto
the
shore
and
ran
it
into
a
shallow
depression
in
the
bank
heaping
stones
and
brush
about
for
its
concealment
then
ashe
intently
surveyed
the
surrounding
country
seeking
a
landmark
inland
from
here
ashe
used
the
language
of
the
beakermen
and
ross
knew
that
from
now
on
he
must
not
only
live
as
a
trader
but
also
think
as
one
all
other
memories
must
be
buried
under
the
false
one
he
had
learned
he
must
be
interested
in
the
present
rate
of
exchange
and
the
chance
for
profit
the
two
men
were
on
their
way
to
outpost
gog
where
ashe
first
partner
the
redoubtable
sanford
was
playing
his
role
so
well
the
rain
squished
in
their
hide
boots
made
sodden
strings
of
their
cloaks
plastered
their
woven
caps
to
their
thick
mats
of
hair
yet
ashe
bore
steadily
on
across
the
land
with
the
certainty
of
one
following
a
marked
trail
his
was
rewarded
within
the
first
half
mile
when
they
came
out
upon
one
of
the
link
trackways
its
beaten
surface
testifying
to
constant
use
here
ashe
turned
eastward
stepping
up
the
pace
to
a
trot
the
peace
of
the
road
held
at
least
by
day
by
night
only
the
most
hardened
and
desperate
outlaws
would
brave
the
harmful
spirits
roving
in
the
dark
all
the
lore
that
had
been
pounded
into
him
at
the
base
began
to
make
some
sense
to
ross
as
he
followed
his
guide
sniffing
strange
wet
smells
from
the
brush
the
trees
and
the
damp
earth
piecing
together
in
his
mind
what
he
had
been
taught
and
what
he
now
saw
for
himself
until
it
made
a
tight
pattern
the
track
they
were
following
sloped
slightly
upward
and
a
change
in
the
wind
brought
to
them
a
sour
odor
blanking
out
all
normal
scents
ashe
halted
so
suddenly
that
ross
almost
plowed
into
him
but
he
was
alerted
by
the
older
man
attitude
something
had
been
burned
ross
drew
in
a
deep
lungful
of
the
smell
and
then
wished
that
he
had
not
it
was
wood
burned
wood
and
something
else
since
this
was
not
possibly
normal
he
was
prepared
for
the
way
ashe
melted
into
cover
in
the
brush
they
worked
their
way
sometimes
crawling
on
their
bellies
through
the
wet
stands
of
dead
grass
taking
full
advantage
of
all
cover
they
crouched
at
the
top
of
the
hill
while
ashe
parted
the
prickly
branches
of
an
evergreen
bush
to
make
them
a
window
the
black
patch
left
by
the
fire
which
had
come
from
a
ruin
above
had
spread
downhill
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
charred
posts
still
stood
like
lone
teeth
in
a
skull
to
mark
what
must
have
once
been
one
of
the
stockade
walls
of
a
post
but
all
they
now
guarded
was
a
desolation
from
which
came
that
overpowering
stench
our
post
ross
asked
in
a
whisper
ashe
nodded
he
was
studying
the
scene
with
an
intent
absorption
which
ross
knew
would
impress
every
important
detail
upon
his
mind
that
the
place
had
been
burned
was
clear
from
the
first
but
why
and
by
whom
was
a
problem
vital
to
the
two
lurking
in
the
brush
it
took
them
almost
an
hour
to
cross
the
valley
an
hour
of
hiding
casting
about
searching
they
had
made
a
complete
circle
of
the
destroyed
post
and
ashe
stood
in
the
shadow
of
a
copse
rubbing
clots
of
mud
from
his
hands
and
frowning
up
at
the
charred
posts
they
were
rushed
or
if
they
were
the
attackers
covered
their
trail
afterward
ross
ventured
the
older
man
shook
his
head
tribesmen
would
not
have
muddled
a
trail
if
they
had
won
no
this
was
no
regular
attack
there
have
been
no
signs
of
a
war
party
coming
or
leaving
then
what
demanded
ross
lightning
for
one
thing
and
we
better
hope
it
was
that
or
ashe
blue
eyes
were
very
cold
and
bleak
as
cold
and
bleak
as
the
countryside
about
them
or
ross
dared
to
prompt
him
or
we
have
made
contact
with
the
reds
in
the
wrong
way
ross
hand
instinctively
went
to
the
dagger
at
his
belt
little
help
a
dagger
would
be
in
an
unequal
struggle
like
this
they
were
only
two
in
a
thin
web
of
men
strung
out
through
centuries
of
time
with
orders
to
seek
out
that
which
did
not
fit
properly
into
the
pattern
of
the
past
to
locate
the
enemy
wherever
in
history
or
prehistory
he
had
gone
to
earth
had
the
reds
been
searching
too
and
was
this
first
disaster
their
victory
the
time
traders
had
their
evidence
when
they
at
last
ventured
into
what
had
been
the
heart
of
outpost
gog
ross
inexperienced
as
he
was
in
such
matters
could
not
mistake
the
signs
of
the
explosion
there
was
a
crater
on
the
crown
of
the
hill
and
ashe
stood
apart
from
it
eying
the
fragments
about
them
scorched
wood
blackened
stone
the
reds
it
must
have
been
this
damage
was
done
by
explosives
it
was
clear
why
outpost
gog
could
not
report
the
disaster
the
attack
had
destroyed
their
one
link
with
the
post
on
this
time
level
the
concealed
communicator
had
gone
up
with
the
blast
eleven
ashe
finger
tapped
on
the
ornate
buckle
of
his
wide
belt
we
have
about
ten
days
to
stick
it
out
he
added
and
it
seems
we
may
be
able
to
use
them
to
better
advantage
than
just
letting
you
learn
how
it
feels
to
walk
about
some
four
thousand
years
before
you
were
born
we
have
to
find
out
if
we
can
what
happened
here
and
why
ross
gazed
at
the
mess
dig
he
asked
some
digging
is
indicated
so
they
dug
finally
black
with
charcoal
smudges
and
sick
with
the
evidences
of
death
they
had
chanced
upon
they
collapsed
on
the
cleanest
spot
they
could
find
they
must
have
hit
at
night
ashe
said
slowly
only
at
that
time
would
they
find
everyone
here
men
do
trust
a
night
filled
with
ghosts
and
our
agents
conform
to
local
custom
as
usual
all
of
the
post
people
could
be
erased
with
one
bomb
at
night
all
except
two
of
them
had
been
true
beaker
traders
including
women
and
children
no
beaker
trading
post
was
large
and
this
one
was
unusually
small
the
attacker
had
wiped
out
some
twenty
people
eighteen
of
them
innocent
victims
how
long
ago
ross
wanted
to
know
maybe
two
days
and
this
attack
came
without
any
warning
or
sandy
would
have
sent
a
message
he
had
no
suspicions
at
all
his
last
reports
were
all
routine
which
means
that
if
they
were
on
to
him
and
they
must
have
been
judging
by
the
results
he
was
not
even
aware
of
it
what
do
we
do
now
ashe
looked
at
him
we
wash
no
he
corrected
himself
we
do
we
go
to
nodren
village
we
are
frightened
we
have
found
our
kinsmen
dead
under
strange
circumstances
we
ask
questions
of
one
to
whom
i
am
known
as
an
inhabitant
of
this
post
so
covered
with
dirt
they
walked
along
the
trackway
toward
the
neighboring
village
with
a
weariness
they
did
not
have
to
counterfeit
the
dog
sighted
or
perhaps
scented
them
first
it
was
a
beast
showing
its
fangs
with
a
wolflike
ferocity
but
it
was
smaller
than
a
wolf
and
it
barked
between
its
warning
snarls
ashe
brought
his
bow
from
beneath
the
shelter
of
his
cloak
and
held
it
ready
ho
one
comes
to
speak
with
nodren
nodren
of
the
hill
only
the
dog
snapped
and
snarled
ashe
rubbed
his
forearm
across
his
face
the
gesture
of
a
weary
and
heartsick
man
smearing
the
ash
and
grime
into
an
awesome
mask
who
speaks
to
nodren
there
was
a
different
twist
to
the
pronunciation
of
some
words
but
ross
was
able
to
understand
one
who
has
hunted
with
him
and
feasted
with
him
the
one
who
gave
into
his
hand
the
friendship
gift
of
the
knife
it
is
assha
of
the
traders
go
far
from
us
man
of
ill
luck
you
who
are
hunted
by
the
evil
spirits
the
last
was
a
shrill
cry
ashe
remained
where
he
was
facing
into
the
bushes
which
hid
the
tribesman
who
speaks
for
nodren
yet
not
with
the
voice
of
nodren
he
demanded
this
is
assha
who
asks
we
have
drunk
blood
together
and
faced
the
white
wolf
and
the
wild
boar
in
their
fury
nodren
lets
not
others
speak
for
him
for
nodren
is
a
man
and
a
chief
and
you
are
cursed
a
stone
flew
through
the
air
striking
a
rain
pool
and
spattering
mud
on
ashe
boots
go
and
take
your
evil
with
you
is
it
from
the
hand
of
nodren
or
nodren
young
men
that
doom
came
upon
those
of
my
blood
have
war
arrows
passed
between
the
place
of
the
traders
and
the
town
of
nodren
is
that
why
you
hide
in
the
shadows
so
that
i
assha
can
not
look
upon
the
face
of
one
who
speaks
boldly
and
throws
stones
no
war
arrows
between
us
trader
do
not
provoke
the
spirits
of
the
hills
no
fire
comes
from
the
sky
at
night
to
eat
us
up
with
a
noise
of
many
thunders
lurgha
speaks
in
such
thunders
lurgha
hand
smites
with
such
fire
you
have
the
wrath
of
lurgha
upon
you
trader
keep
away
from
us
lest
lurgha
wrath
fall
upon
us
also
lurgha
was
the
local
storm
god
ross
recalled
the
sound
of
thunder
and
fire
coming
out
of
the
sky
at
night
the
bomb
perhaps
the
very
method
of
attack
on
the
post
would
defeat
ashe
attempt
to
learn
anything
from
these
neighbors
the
superstitions
of
the
people
would
lead
them
to
shun
both
the
site
of
the
post
and
ashe
himself
as
cursed
and
taboo
if
the
wrath
of
lurgha
had
struck
at
assha
would
assha
still
live
to
walk
upon
this
road
ashe
prodded
the
ground
with
the
tip
of
his
bowstave
yet
assha
walks
as
you
see
him
assha
talks
as
you
hear
him
it
is
ridiculous
to
answer
him
with
the
nonsense
of
little
children
spirits
so
walk
and
talk
to
unlucky
men
retorted
the
man
in
hiding
it
may
be
the
spirit
of
assha
who
does
so
now
ashe
made
a
sudden
leap
there
was
a
flurry
of
action
behind
the
bush
screen
and
he
reappeared
dragging
into
the
gray
light
of
the
rainy
day
a
wriggling
captive
whom
he
bumped
without
ceremony
onto
the
beaten
earth
of
the
road
the
man
was
bearded
wearing
his
thick
mop
of
black
hair
in
a
round
topknot
secured
by
a
hide
loop
he
wore
a
skin
tunic
now
in
considerable
disarray
which
was
held
in
place
with
a
woven
tasseled
belt
ho
so
it
is
lal
of
the
quick
tongue
who
speaks
so
loudly
of
spirits
and
the
wrath
of
lurgha
ashe
studied
his
captive
now
lal
since
you
speak
for
nodren
which
i
believe
will
greatly
surprise
him
you
will
continue
to
tell
me
of
this
wrath
of
lurgha
from
the
night
skies
and
what
has
happened
to
sanfra
who
was
my
brother
and
those
others
of
my
kin
i
am
assha
and
you
know
of
the
wrath
of
assha
and
how
it
ate
up
the
outlaw
when
he
came
in
with
his
evil
men
the
wrath
of
lurgha
is
hot
but
so
too
is
the
wrath
of
assha
ashe
contorted
his
face
in
such
a
way
that
lal
squirmed
and
looked
away
when
the
tribesman
spoke
all
his
former
authority
and
bluster
had
gone
assha
knows
that
i
am
as
his
dog
let
him
not
turn
upon
me
his
big
knife
nor
the
arrows
from
his
lightning
bow
it
was
the
wrath
of
lurgha
which
smote
the
place
on
the
hill
first
the
thunder
of
his
fist
meeting
the
earth
and
then
the
fire
which
he
breathed
upon
those
whom
he
would
slay
and
this
you
saw
with
your
own
eyes
lal
the
shaggy
head
shook
an
emphatic
negative
assha
knows
that
lal
is
no
chief
who
can
stand
and
look
upon
the
wonders
of
lurgha
might
and
keep
his
eyes
in
his
head
nodren
himself
saw
this
wonder
and
if
lurgha
came
in
the
night
when
all
men
keep
to
their
homes
and
leave
the
outer
world
to
the
restless
spirits
how
did
nodren
see
his
coming
lal
crouched
lower
to
the
ground
his
eyes
darting
to
the
bushes
and
the
freedom
they
promised
then
back
to
ashe
firmly
planted
boots
i
am
not
a
chief
assha
how
could
i
know
in
what
way
or
for
what
reason
nodren
saw
the
coming
of
lurgha
fool
a
second
voice
that
of
a
woman
spat
the
word
from
the
brush
which
fringed
the
roadway
speak
to
assha
with
a
straight
tongue
if
he
is
a
spirit
he
will
know
that
you
do
not
tell
him
the
truth
and
if
he
has
been
spared
by
lurgha
she
showed
her
wonderment
with
a
hiss
of
indrawn
breath
so
urged
lal
mumbled
sullenly
it
is
said
that
there
came
a
message
for
one
to
witness
the
wrath
of
lurgha
in
its
descent
upon
the
outlanders
so
that
nodren
and
the
men
of
nodren
would
truly
know
that
the
traders
were
cursed
and
should
be
put
to
the
spear
should
they
come
here
again
this
message
how
was
it
brought
did
the
voice
of
lurgha
sound
in
nodren
ear
alone
or
came
it
by
the
tongue
of
some
man
ahee
lal
lay
flat
on
the
ground
his
hands
over
his
ears
lal
is
a
fool
and
fears
his
own
shadow
as
it
skips
before
him
on
a
sunny
day
out
of
the
bushes
stepped
a
young
woman
obviously
of
some
importance
in
her
own
group
walking
with
a
proud
stride
her
eyes
boldly
met
ashe
a
shining
disk
hung
about
her
neck
on
a
thong
and
another
decorated
the
woven
belt
of
her
cloth
tunic
her
hair
was
bound
in
a
thread
net
fastened
with
jet
pins
i
greet
cassca
who
is
the
first
sower
there
was
a
formal
note
in
ashe
voice
but
why
should
cassca
hide
from
assha
there
has
been
death
on
your
hill
assha
she
sniffed
you
smell
of
it
now
lurgha
death
those
who
come
from
that
hill
may
well
be
some
who
no
longer
walk
in
their
bodies
cassca
placed
her
fingers
momentarily
on
ashe
outstretched
palm
before
she
nodded
no
spirit
are
you
assha
for
all
know
that
a
spirit
is
solid
to
the
eye
but
not
to
the
touch
so
it
would
seem
that
you
were
not
burned
up
by
lurgha
after
all
this
matter
of
a
message
from
lurgha
he
prompted
it
came
out
of
the
empty
air
in
the
hearing
not
only
of
nodren
but
also
of
hangor
effar
and
myself
cassca
for
we
stood
at
that
time
near
the
old
place
she
made
a
curious
gesture
with
the
fingers
of
her
right
hand
it
will
soon
be
the
time
of
sowing
and
though
lurgha
brings
sun
and
rain
to
feed
the
grain
yet
it
is
in
the
great
mother
that
the
seed
lies
upon
her
business
only
women
may
go
into
the
inner
circle
she
gestured
again
but
as
we
met
to
make
the
first
sacrifice
there
came
music
out
of
the
air
such
as
we
have
never
heard
voices
singing
like
birds
in
a
strange
tongue
her
face
assumed
an
awesome
expression
afterward
a
voice
said
that
lurgha
was
angered
with
the
hill
of
the
and
that
in
the
night
he
would
send
his
wrath
against
them
and
that
nodren
must
witness
this
thing
so
that
he
could
see
what
lurgha
did
to
those
he
would
punish
so
it
was
done
by
nodren
and
there
was
a
sound
in
the
air
what
kind
of
a
sound
ashe
asked
quietly
nodren
said
it
was
a
hum
and
there
was
the
dark
shadow
of
lurgha
bird
between
him
and
the
stars
then
came
the
smiting
of
the
hill
with
thunder
and
lightning
and
nodren
fled
for
the
wrath
of
lurgha
is
a
fearsome
thing
now
do
the
people
come
to
the
great
mother
place
with
many
fine
offerings
that
she
may
stand
between
them
and
that
wrath
assha
thanks
cassca
who
is
the
handmaiden
of
the
great
mother
may
the
sowing
prosper
and
the
reaping
be
good
this
year
ashe
said
finally
ignoring
lal
who
still
groveled
on
the
road
you
go
from
this
place
assha
she
asked
for
though
i
stand
under
the
protecting
hand
of
the
mother
and
so
do
not
fear
yet
there
are
others
who
will
raise
their
spears
against
you
for
the
honor
of
lurgha
we
go
and
again
thanks
be
to
you
cassca
he
turned
back
the
way
they
had
come
and
ross
fell
in
beside
him
as
the
woman
watched
them
out
of
sight
chapter
that
bird
of
lurgha
said
ross
once
they
were
out
of
sight
of
cassca
and
lal
could
it
have
been
a
plane
sounds
like
it
snapped
his
companion
if
the
reds
have
done
their
work
efficiently
and
there
no
reason
to
suppose
otherwise
then
there
is
no
use
in
contacting
either
dorhta
town
or
munga
the
same
announcement
concerning
the
wrath
of
lurgha
was
probably
made
there
to
their
good
purpose
not
ours
cassca
did
seem
to
be
overly
impressed
with
lurgha
curse
not
as
much
as
the
man
was
she
is
the
closest
thing
to
a
priestess
that
this
tribe
knows
and
she
serves
a
goddess
older
and
more
powerful
than
lurgha
the
mother
earth
the
great
mother
goddess
of
fertility
and
growth
nodren
people
believe
that
unless
cassca
performs
her
mysteries
and
sows
part
of
the
first
field
in
the
spring
there
wo
be
any
harvest
consequently
she
is
secure
in
her
office
and
does
fear
the
wrath
of
lurgha
too
much
these
people
are
now
changing
from
one
type
of
worship
to
another
but
some
of
cassca
beliefs
will
persist
clear
down
to
our
day
taking
on
the
coating
of
and
a
lot
of
other
enameling
along
the
way
ashe
had
been
talking
as
a
man
talks
to
cover
up
furious
thinking
now
he
paused
again
and
turned
toward
the
sea
we
have
to
stick
it
out
somewhere
until
the
sub
comes
to
pick
us
up
we
need
shelter
will
the
tribesmen
be
after
us
they
may
well
be
let
the
right
men
get
to
talking
up
a
holy
extermination
of
those
upon
whom
the
wrath
of
lurgha
has
fallen
and
we
could
be
in
for
plenty
of
trouble
some
of
those
men
are
trained
hunters
and
trackers
and
the
reds
may
have
planted
an
agent
to
report
the
return
of
anyone
to
our
post
just
now
we
about
the
most
important
time
travelers
out
for
we
know
the
reds
have
appeared
on
this
line
they
must
have
a
large
post
here
too
or
they
could
have
sent
a
plane
on
that
raid
you
ca
build
a
time
transport
large
enough
to
take
through
a
considerable
amount
of
material
everything
used
by
us
in
this
age
has
to
be
assembled
on
this
side
and
the
use
of
all
machines
is
limited
to
where
they
can
not
be
seen
by
any
natives
luckily
large
sections
of
this
world
are
mostly
wilderness
and
unpopulated
in
the
areas
where
we
operate
the
base
posts
so
if
the
reds
have
a
plane
it
was
put
together
here
and
that
means
a
big
post
somewhere
again
ashe
was
thinking
aloud
as
he
pushed
ahead
of
ross
into
the
fringes
of
a
wood
sandy
and
i
scouted
this
territory
pretty
well
last
spring
there
is
a
cave
about
half
a
mile
to
the
west
it
will
shelter
us
for
tonight
ashe
plans
would
probably
have
been
easily
accomplished
if
the
cave
had
been
unoccupied
without
incident
they
came
down
into
a
hollow
through
which
trickled
a
small
stream
its
banks
laced
with
a
thin
edging
of
ice
under
ashe
direction
ross
collected
an
armload
of
firewood
he
was
no
woodsman
and
his
prolonged
exposure
to
the
chilling
drizzle
made
him
eager
for
even
the
very
rough
shelter
of
a
cave
so
eager
that
he
plunged
forward
carelessly
his
foot
came
down
on
a
slippery
patch
of
mud
sending
him
sprawling
on
his
face
there
was
a
growl
and
a
white
bulk
rushed
him
the
cloak
rucked
up
about
his
throat
and
shoulders
then
saved
his
life
for
only
stout
cloth
was
caught
between
those
fangs
with
a
startled
cry
ross
rolled
as
he
might
have
to
escape
a
attack
struggling
to
unsheath
his
dagger
a
flash
of
pain
scored
his
upper
arm
the
breath
was
driven
out
of
him
as
a
fight
raged
over
his
prone
body
he
heard
grunts
snarls
and
was
severely
pommeled
then
he
was
free
as
the
bodies
broke
away
shaken
he
got
to
his
knees
a
short
distance
away
the
fight
was
still
in
progress
he
saw
ashe
straddle
the
body
of
a
huge
white
wolf
his
legs
clamped
about
the
animal
haunches
his
hooked
arm
under
the
beast
head
forcing
it
up
and
back
while
his
dagger
rose
and
sank
twice
in
the
underparts
of
the
heaving
body
ross
held
his
own
weapon
ready
he
leaped
from
a
half
crouch
and
his
dagger
sank
cleanly
home
behind
the
short
ribs
one
of
their
blows
must
have
reached
the
animal
heart
with
an
almost
human
cry
the
wolf
stiffened
convulsively
then
it
was
still
ashe
squatted
near
it
methodically
driving
his
dagger
into
the
moist
soil
to
clean
the
blade
a
red
rivulet
trickled
down
his
thigh
where
the
lower
edge
of
his
had
been
ripped
up
to
the
link
belt
he
was
breathing
hard
but
otherwise
he
was
as
composed
as
always
these
sometimes
hunt
in
pairs
at
this
season
he
observed
be
ready
with
your
bow
ross
strung
his
with
the
cord
he
had
been
keeping
dry
within
the
breast
folds
of
his
tunic
he
fitted
an
arrow
to
the
string
grateful
to
be
a
passable
marksman
the
slash
on
his
arm
smarted
in
protest
as
he
moved
and
he
noted
that
ashe
did
not
try
to
get
up
a
bad
one
ross
indicated
the
blood
now
thickening
into
a
stream
along
ashe
thigh
ashe
pulled
away
the
torn
tunic
and
exposed
a
nasty
looking
gash
on
the
outside
of
his
hip
he
pressed
his
palm
against
the
gaping
wound
and
motioned
ross
to
scout
ahead
see
if
the
cave
is
clear
we
ca
do
anything
until
we
know
that
reluctantly
ross
followed
the
stream
until
he
found
the
cave
a
place
with
an
overhang
to
keep
it
dry
the
unpleasant
smell
of
a
lair
hung
about
its
mouth
he
chose
a
stone
from
the
stream
chucked
it
into
the
dark
opening
and
waited
the
stone
rattled
as
it
struck
an
inner
wall
but
there
was
no
other
sound
a
second
stone
from
a
different
angle
followed
the
first
with
the
same
results
ross
was
now
certain
that
the
cave
was
unoccupied
once
they
were
inside
with
a
fire
going
at
the
entrance
they
could
hope
to
keep
it
free
of
intruders
a
little
heartened
he
cast
about
a
bit
upstream
and
then
turned
back
to
where
he
had
left
ashe
no
male
the
other
greeted
him
this
is
a
female
and
she
was
close
to
whelping
he
nudged
the
white
wolf
with
his
toe
his
hands
held
a
pad
of
rags
against
his
hip
and
his
face
was
shaded
with
pain
nothing
in
the
cave
anyway
let
see
about
this
ross
laid
aside
the
bow
and
kneeled
to
examine
ashe
thigh
wound
his
own
slash
was
more
of
a
smarting
graze
but
this
tear
was
deep
and
ugly
second
plate
belt
ashe
got
the
words
out
between
set
teeth
and
ross
clicked
open
the
hidden
recess
in
the
other
bronze
belt
to
bring
out
a
small
packet
ashe
made
a
wry
face
as
he
swallowed
three
of
the
pills
within
ross
mashed
another
pill
onto
the
bandage
he
prepared
and
when
the
last
cumbersome
fold
was
secure
ashe
relaxed
let
us
hope
that
works
he
commented
a
little
bleakly
now
come
here
where
i
can
get
my
hands
on
you
and
let
me
see
your
scratch
animal
bites
can
be
a
nasty
business
bandaged
in
turn
with
the
bitterness
of
the
pill
on
his
tongue
ross
helped
ashe
limp
upstream
to
the
cave
he
left
the
older
man
outside
while
he
cleaned
up
the
floor
of
the
cave
and
then
made
his
companion
as
comfortable
as
he
could
on
a
bed
of
bracken
the
fire
ross
had
longed
for
was
built
they
stripped
off
their
sodden
clothing
and
hung
it
to
dry
ross
wrapped
a
bird
he
had
shot
in
clay
and
tucked
it
under
the
hot
coals
to
be
roasted
they
had
surely
had
bad
luck
he
thought
but
they
were
now
undercover
had
a
fire
and
food
of
a
sort
his
arm
ached
sharp
pain
shooting
from
fingers
to
elbow
when
he
moved
it
though
ashe
made
no
complaint
ross
gauged
that
the
older
man
discomfort
was
far
worse
than
his
own
and
he
carefully
hid
all
signs
of
his
own
twinges
they
ate
the
bird
saltless
and
with
their
fingers
ross
savored
each
greasy
bite
licking
his
hands
clean
afterward
while
ashe
lay
back
on
the
improvised
bed
his
face
gaunt
in
the
half
light
of
the
fire
we
are
about
five
miles
from
the
sea
here
there
is
no
way
of
raising
our
base
now
that
sandy
installation
is
gone
i
have
to
lay
up
since
i
ca
risk
any
more
loss
of
blood
and
you
not
too
good
in
the
woods
ross
accepted
that
valuation
with
a
new
humbleness
he
was
only
too
well
aware
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
ashe
he
and
not
the
white
wolf
would
have
died
down
in
the
valley
yet
a
strange
shyness
kept
him
from
trying
to
put
his
thanks
into
words
the
only
kind
of
amends
he
could
make
for
the
other
hurt
was
to
provide
hands
feet
and
strength
for
the
man
who
did
know
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
we
have
to
hunt
he
ventured
deer
ashe
caught
him
up
but
the
marsh
at
the
mouth
of
this
stream
provides
a
better
hunting
ground
than
inland
if
the
wolf
laired
here
very
long
she
has
already
frightened
away
any
large
game
it
is
the
matter
of
food
which
bothers
me
it
is
being
tied
up
here
ross
filled
in
for
him
with
some
daring
but
look
here
i
take
orders
this
is
your
territory
and
i
green
at
the
game
you
tell
me
what
to
do
and
i
do
it
the
best
that
i
can
he
glanced
up
to
find
ashe
surveying
him
intently
but
as
usual
there
was
no
readable
expression
on
the
other
brown
face
the
first
thing
to
do
is
get
the
wolf
hide
ashe
said
briskly
then
bury
the
carcass
you
better
drag
it
up
here
to
work
on
it
if
her
mate
is
hanging
around
he
might
try
to
jump
you
why
ashe
should
think
it
necessary
to
acquire
the
wolf
skin
puzzled
ross
but
he
asked
no
questions
his
skinning
task
took
four
times
as
long
and
was
far
from
being
the
neat
job
the
man
of
the
record
tape
had
accomplished
ross
had
to
wash
himself
off
in
the
stream
before
piling
stones
over
the
corpse
in
temporary
burial
when
he
pulled
his
bloody
burden
back
to
the
cave
ashe
lay
with
his
eyes
closed
ross
thankfully
sat
on
his
own
pile
of
bracken
and
tried
not
to
notice
the
throbbing
ache
in
his
arm
he
must
have
fallen
asleep
for
when
he
roused
it
was
to
see
ashe
crawl
over
to
mend
the
dying
fire
from
their
store
of
wood
ross
angry
at
himself
beat
the
other
to
the
task
get
back
he
said
roughly
this
is
my
job
i
did
mean
to
fail
surprisingly
ashe
settled
back
without
a
word
leaving
ross
to
sit
by
the
fire
a
fire
he
was
very
glad
to
have
a
moment
or
so
later
when
a
wailing
howl
sounded
if
this
was
not
the
white
wolf
mate
then
it
was
another
of
her
kin
who
prowled
the
upper
reaches
of
the
small
valley
the
next
day
having
provided
ashe
with
a
supply
of
firewood
ross
went
to
try
his
luck
in
the
marsh
the
thick
drizzle
which
had
hung
over
the
land
the
day
before
was
gone
and
he
faced
a
clear
bright
morning
though
the
breeze
had
an
icy
snap
but
it
was
a
good
morning
to
be
alive
and
out
in
the
open
and
ross
spirits
rose
he
tried
to
put
to
use
all
the
woodlore
he
had
learned
at
the
base
but
it
was
one
thing
to
learn
something
academically
and
another
to
put
that
learning
into
practice
he
was
uncomfortably
certain
that
ashe
would
not
have
found
his
showing
very
good
the
marsh
was
a
series
of
pools
between
rank
growths
of
leafless
willows
and
coarse
tufts
of
grass
with
hillocks
of
firmer
soil
rising
like
islands
ross
approaching
with
caution
was
glad
of
it
for
from
one
of
those
hillocks
arose
a
trail
of
white
smoke
and
he
saw
a
black
blot
which
was
probably
a
rude
hut
why
one
should
choose
to
live
in
the
midst
of
such
country
he
could
not
guess
though
it
might
be
merely
the
temporary
camp
of
some
hunter
ross
also
saw
thousands
of
birds
feeding
greedily
on
the
dried
seed
of
the
marsh
grasses
paddling
in
the
pools
and
setting
up
a
clamor
to
drive
a
man
mad
they
did
not
seem
in
the
least
disturbed
by
that
distant
camper
ross
had
reason
to
be
proud
of
his
marksmanship
that
morning
he
had
in
his
quiver
perhaps
half
a
dozen
of
the
lighter
shafts
made
for
shooting
birds
in
place
of
the
finely
chipped
and
wickedly
barbed
flint
points
used
for
heavier
game
these
were
tipped
with
light
bone
heads
he
had
a
string
of
four
birds
looped
together
by
their
feet
within
almost
as
many
minutes
for
the
flocks
rose
in
their
first
alarm
only
to
settle
again
to
feast
then
he
knocked
over
a
hare
a
fat
giant
of
its
race
that
stared
at
him
brazenly
from
a
tussock
the
hare
kicked
back
into
a
pool
in
its
death
struggle
however
and
ross
was
forced
to
leave
cover
to
retrieve
its
body
but
he
was
alert
and
he
stood
up
dagger
out
and
ready
to
greet
the
man
who
parted
the
bushes
to
watch
him
for
a
long
minute
gray
eyes
stared
into
brown
ones
and
then
ross
noted
the
other
bedraggled
and
tattered
dress
the
smudged
with
mud
scorched
and
charred
along
one
edge
was
styled
like
his
own
the
fellow
wore
his
hair
fastened
back
with
a
band
unlike
the
topknot
of
the
local
tribesman
ross
his
dagger
still
ready
broke
the
silence
first
i
am
a
believer
in
the
fire
and
the
fashioned
metal
the
climbing
sun
and
the
moving
water
he
repeated
the
recognition
speech
of
the
beakermen
the
fire
warms
by
the
grace
of
tulden
the
metal
is
fashioned
by
the
mystery
of
the
smith
the
sun
climbs
without
our
aid
and
who
can
stop
the
water
from
running
the
stranger
voice
was
hoarse
now
that
ross
had
time
to
examine
him
more
closely
he
saw
the
dark
bruise
on
his
exposed
shoulder
the
raw
red
mark
of
a
burn
running
across
the
broad
chest
he
dared
to
test
his
surmise
concerning
the
other
i
am
of
the
kin
of
assha
we
returned
to
the
hill
ashe
not
assha
but
ashe
ross
though
sure
of
that
pronunciation
was
still
cautious
you
are
from
the
hill
place
where
lurgha
smote
with
thunder
and
fire
the
man
slid
his
long
legs
across
the
log
which
had
been
his
shelter
the
burn
across
his
chest
was
not
his
only
brand
for
ross
noticed
another
red
stripe
puffed
and
fiery
looking
which
swelled
the
calf
of
one
leg
the
man
studied
ross
closely
and
then
his
fingers
moved
in
a
sign
which
to
the
uninitiated
native
might
have
been
one
for
the
warding
off
of
evil
but
which
to
ross
was
the
thumbs
up
of
his
own
age
sanford
at
that
name
the
man
shook
his
head
mcneil
he
named
himself
where
is
ashe
he
might
really
be
what
he
seemed
but
on
the
other
hand
he
could
be
a
red
spy
ross
had
not
forgotten
kurt
what
happened
he
parried
one
question
with
another
bomb
the
reds
must
have
spotted
us
and
we
did
have
a
chance
we
were
expecting
any
trouble
i
been
down
to
see
about
a
missing
burden
donkey
and
was
about
halfway
back
up
the
hill
when
she
hit
when
i
came
to
i
was
all
the
way
down
the
hill
with
part
of
the
fort
on
top
of
me
the
rest
well
you
saw
the
place
did
you
ross
nodded
what
are
you
doing
here
mcneil
spread
his
hands
in
a
tired
little
gesture
i
tried
to
talk
to
nodren
but
they
stoned
me
away
i
knew
that
ashe
was
coming
through
and
hoped
to
reach
him
when
he
hit
the
beach
but
i
was
too
late
then
i
figured
he
would
pass
here
to
make
contact
with
the
sub
so
i
was
waiting
it
out
until
i
saw
you
where
is
ashe
it
all
sounded
logical
enough
still
with
ashe
injured
ross
was
taking
no
chances
he
pushed
his
dagger
back
into
its
sheath
and
picked
up
the
hare
stay
here
he
told
mcneil
i
be
back
but
wait
where
ashe
you
young
fool
we
have
to
get
together
ross
went
on
he
was
sure
that
the
stranger
was
in
no
shape
to
race
after
him
and
he
would
lay
a
muddled
trail
before
he
returned
to
the
cave
valley
if
this
man
was
a
red
plant
he
would
have
to
reckon
with
one
who
had
already
met
kurt
vogel
the
laying
of
that
muddled
trail
took
time
it
was
past
midday
when
ross
came
back
to
ashe
who
was
sitting
up
by
the
mouth
of
the
cave
at
the
fire
using
his
dagger
to
fashion
a
crutch
out
of
a
length
of
sapling
he
surveyed
ross
burden
with
approval
but
lost
interest
in
the
promise
of
food
as
soon
as
the
other
reported
his
meeting
in
the
marsh
mcneil
chap
with
brown
hair
brown
eyes
a
right
eyebrow
which
quirks
up
toward
his
hairline
when
he
smiles
brown
hair
and
eyes
okay
and
he
did
smile
any
chip
broken
off
a
front
tooth
upper
right
ross
shut
his
eyes
to
visualize
the
stranger
yes
there
had
been
a
small
break
on
a
front
tooth
he
nodded
that
mcneil
not
that
you
did
do
right
not
to
bring
him
here
without
being
sure
what
made
you
so
watchful
kurt
again
ross
nodded
and
what
you
said
about
the
reds
planting
someone
here
to
wait
for
us
ashe
scratched
the
bristles
on
his
chin
never
underrate
them
we
dare
do
that
but
the
man
you
met
is
mcneil
and
we
better
get
him
here
can
you
bring
him
i
think
he
able
to
get
about
in
spite
of
that
leg
from
his
story
he
been
stirring
around
ashe
bit
into
a
piece
of
hare
and
swore
mildly
when
he
burned
his
tongue
odd
that
cassca
did
tell
us
about
him
unless
she
thought
there
was
no
use
causing
trouble
by
admitting
they
had
driven
him
away
you
going
now
ross
moved
around
the
fire
might
as
well
he
did
look
too
comfortable
and
i
bet
he
hungry
he
took
the
direct
route
back
to
the
marsh
but
this
time
no
thread
of
smoke
spiraled
into
the
air
ross
hesitated
that
shelter
on
the
small
island
was
surely
the
place
where
mcneil
had
holed
up
should
he
try
to
work
his
way
out
to
it
now
or
had
something
happened
to
the
man
while
he
was
gone
again
that
sixth
sense
of
impending
disaster
which
is
perhaps
bred
into
some
men
alerted
ross
why
he
turned
suddenly
and
backed
against
a
bushy
willow
he
could
not
have
explained
however
because
he
did
so
the
loop
of
hide
rope
meant
for
his
throat
hit
his
shoulder
harmlessly
it
fell
to
the
ground
and
he
stamped
one
boot
down
on
it
then
it
was
the
work
of
seconds
to
grasp
it
and
give
it
a
quick
jerk
the
surprised
man
who
held
the
other
end
was
brought
sprawling
into
the
open
ross
had
seen
that
round
face
before
lal
of
the
town
of
nodren
he
found
words
to
greet
the
ropeman
even
as
his
knee
came
up
against
the
fellow
jaw
jarring
lal
so
that
he
dropped
a
flint
knife
ross
kicked
it
into
the
willows
what
do
you
hunt
here
lal
traders
the
voice
was
weak
but
it
held
heat
the
tribesman
did
not
try
to
struggle
against
ross
hold
and
ross
gripping
him
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
moved
through
a
screen
of
brush
to
a
hollow
luckily
there
was
no
water
cupped
there
for
mcneil
lay
in
the
bottom
of
that
dip
his
arms
tied
tightly
behind
him
and
his
ankles
lashed
together
with
no
thought
for
the
pain
of
his
burned
leg
chapter
ross
whirled
the
rope
which
had
been
meant
to
bring
him
down
around
lal
he
lashed
the
tribesman
arms
tight
to
his
body
before
he
knelt
to
cut
loose
his
fellow
time
traveler
lal
now
huddled
against
the
far
wall
of
the
cup
fear
in
every
line
of
his
small
body
so
apparent
was
this
fear
that
ross
felt
no
satisfaction
at
turning
the
tables
on
him
instead
he
felt
increasingly
uneasy
what
is
this
all
about
he
asked
mcneil
as
he
stripped
off
his
bonds
and
helped
him
up
mcneil
massaged
his
wrists
took
a
step
or
two
and
grimaced
with
pain
our
friend
seeks
to
be
an
obedient
servant
of
lurgha
ross
picked
up
his
bow
the
tribe
is
out
to
hunt
us
lurgha
has
ordered
out
of
thin
air
again
that
any
traders
who
escaped
are
to
be
brought
in
and
introduced
to
him
personally
at
the
sacrifice
for
the
enrichment
of
the
fields
the
old
old
gift
of
blood
and
life
at
the
spring
sowing
ross
recalled
grisly
details
from
his
cram
lessons
any
wandering
stranger
or
enemy
tribesman
taken
in
a
raid
before
that
day
would
meet
such
a
fate
on
unlucky
years
when
people
were
not
available
a
deer
or
wolf
might
serve
but
the
best
sacrifice
of
all
was
a
man
so
lurgha
had
decreed
from
the
air
that
traders
were
his
meat
what
of
ashe
let
any
hunter
from
the
village
track
him
down
we
have
to
move
fast
ross
told
mcneil
as
he
took
up
the
rope
which
made
a
leading
cord
for
lal
ashe
would
want
to
question
the
tribesman
about
this
second
order
from
lurgha
impatient
as
ross
was
he
had
to
mend
his
pace
to
accommodate
mcneil
the
man
from
the
hill
post
was
close
to
the
end
of
his
strength
he
had
started
off
bravely
enough
but
now
he
wavered
ross
sent
lal
ahead
with
a
sharp
push
ordering
him
to
stay
there
while
he
went
to
mcneil
aid
it
was
well
into
the
afternoon
before
they
came
up
the
stream
and
saw
the
fire
before
the
cave
macna
ashe
hailed
ross
companion
with
the
native
version
of
his
name
and
lal
but
what
do
you
here
lal
of
nodren
town
mischief
ross
helped
mcneil
within
the
cave
and
to
the
pile
of
brush
which
was
his
own
bed
he
was
hunting
traders
as
a
present
for
lurgha
so
ashe
turned
upon
the
tribesman
and
by
whose
word
did
you
go
hunting
my
kinsman
lal
was
it
nodren
has
he
forgotten
the
blood
bond
between
us
for
it
was
in
the
name
of
lurgha
himself
that
that
bond
was
made
aaaah
the
tribesman
squatted
down
against
the
wall
where
ross
had
shoved
him
unable
to
hide
his
head
in
his
arms
he
brought
his
face
down
upon
his
knees
so
that
only
his
shaggy
topknot
of
hair
was
exposed
ross
realized
with
stupefaction
that
the
little
man
was
crying
like
a
child
his
hunched
shoulders
rising
and
falling
with
the
force
of
his
sobs
aaaah
he
wailed
ashe
allowed
him
a
moment
or
two
of
noisy
grief
and
then
limped
over
to
grasp
his
topknot
and
pull
up
his
head
lal
eyes
were
screwed
tightly
shut
but
there
were
tears
on
his
cheeks
and
his
mouth
twisted
in
another
wail
be
quiet
ashe
shook
him
but
not
too
harshly
have
you
yet
felt
the
bite
of
my
sharp
knife
has
an
arrow
holed
your
skin
you
are
alive
and
you
could
be
dead
show
that
you
are
glad
you
live
and
continue
to
breathe
by
telling
us
what
you
know
lal
the
woman
cassca
had
displayed
a
measure
of
intelligence
and
ease
at
their
meeting
upon
the
road
but
it
was
very
plain
that
lal
was
of
different
stuff
a
simple
man
in
whose
head
few
ideas
could
find
house
room
at
one
time
and
to
him
the
present
was
all
black
little
by
little
they
dragged
the
story
out
of
him
lal
was
poor
so
poor
that
he
had
never
dared
dream
of
owning
for
himself
some
of
the
precious
things
the
hill
traders
displayed
to
the
wealthy
of
nodren
town
but
he
was
also
a
follower
of
the
great
mother
rather
than
one
who
made
sacrifices
to
lurgha
lurgha
was
the
god
for
warriors
and
great
men
he
was
too
high
to
concern
himself
with
such
as
lal
so
when
nodren
reported
the
end
of
the
hill
post
under
the
storm
fist
of
lurgha
lal
had
been
impressed
only
to
a
point
he
was
still
convinced
it
was
none
of
his
concern
and
instead
he
began
thinking
of
the
treasures
which
might
lie
hidden
in
the
destroyed
buildings
it
occurred
to
him
that
lurgha
wrath
had
been
laid
upon
the
men
who
had
owned
them
but
perhaps
it
would
not
stretch
to
the
fine
things
themselves
so
he
had
gone
secretly
to
the
hill
to
explore
what
he
had
seen
there
had
utterly
converted
him
to
a
belief
in
the
fury
of
lurgha
and
he
had
been
frightened
out
of
his
simple
wits
fleeing
without
making
the
search
he
had
intended
but
lurgha
had
seen
him
there
had
read
his
impious
thoughts
at
that
point
ashe
interrupted
the
stream
of
lal
story
how
had
lurgha
seen
lal
because
lal
shuddered
began
to
cry
again
and
spoke
the
next
few
sentences
haltingly
that
very
morning
when
he
had
gone
out
to
hunt
wild
fowl
in
the
marshes
lurgha
had
spoken
to
to
lal
who
was
less
than
a
flea
creeping
upon
a
fur
rug
and
how
had
lurgha
spoken
ashe
voice
was
softer
gentle
out
of
the
air
even
as
he
had
spoken
to
nodren
who
was
a
chief
he
said
that
he
had
seen
lal
in
the
hill
post
and
so
lal
was
his
meat
but
not
yet
would
he
eat
him
not
if
lal
served
him
in
other
ways
and
he
lal
had
lain
flat
on
the
ground
before
the
bodiless
voice
of
lurgha
and
had
sworn
that
he
would
serve
lurgha
to
the
end
of
his
life
then
lurgha
had
told
him
to
hunt
down
one
of
the
evil
traders
who
was
hiding
in
the
marshes
and
bind
him
with
ropes
then
he
was
to
call
the
men
of
the
village
and
together
they
would
carry
the
prisoner
to
the
hill
where
lurgha
had
loosed
his
wrath
and
there
they
would
leave
him
later
they
might
return
and
take
what
they
found
there
and
use
it
to
bless
the
fields
at
sowing
time
and
all
would
be
well
with
village
and
lal
had
sworn
that
he
would
do
as
lurgha
bade
but
now
he
could
not
so
lurgha
would
eat
him
up
he
was
a
man
without
hope
yet
ashe
said
even
more
gently
have
you
not
served
the
great
mother
all
these
years
giving
to
her
a
portion
of
the
first
fruits
even
when
the
yield
of
your
one
field
was
small
lal
stared
at
him
his
woebegone
face
still
smeared
with
tears
it
took
a
second
or
two
for
the
question
to
penetrate
his
mind
then
he
nodded
timidly
has
she
not
dealt
with
you
well
in
return
lal
you
are
a
poor
man
that
is
true
but
you
are
not
gaunt
of
belly
even
though
this
is
the
thin
season
when
men
fast
before
the
coming
of
the
new
harvest
the
great
mother
watches
over
her
own
and
it
is
she
who
has
brought
you
to
us
now
for
this
i
say
to
you
lal
and
i
assha
of
the
traders
speak
with
a
straight
tongue
the
lurgha
who
struck
our
post
who
spoke
to
you
from
the
air
means
you
no
good
aaaah
wailed
lal
so
do
i
know
assha
he
is
of
the
blackness
and
the
wandering
spirits
of
the
dark
just
so
thus
he
is
no
kin
to
the
mother
for
she
is
of
the
light
and
of
good
things
of
the
new
grain
and
the
newborn
lambs
for
your
flocks
of
the
maids
who
wed
with
men
and
bring
forth
sons
to
lift
their
fathers
spears
daughters
to
spin
by
the
hearth
and
sow
the
yellow
grain
in
the
furrows
lurgha
quarrel
lies
with
us
lal
not
with
nodren
nor
with
you
and
we
take
upon
us
that
quarrel
he
limped
into
the
outer
air
where
the
shadows
of
evening
were
beginning
to
creep
across
the
ground
hear
me
lurgha
he
called
into
the
coming
night
i
am
assha
of
the
traders
and
upon
myself
i
take
your
hate
not
upon
lal
nor
upon
nodren
nor
upon
the
people
who
live
in
nodren
town
shall
your
wrath
lie
thus
do
i
say
it
ross
noticing
that
ashe
concealed
from
lal
a
wave
of
his
hand
was
prepared
for
some
display
meant
to
impress
the
tribesman
it
came
in
a
spectacular
burst
of
green
fire
beyond
the
stream
lal
wailed
again
but
when
that
fire
was
followed
by
no
other
manifestation
he
ventured
to
raise
his
head
once
more
you
have
seen
how
lurgha
answered
me
lal
toward
me
only
will
his
wrath
be
turned
now
ashe
limped
back
and
dragged
out
the
white
wolf
skin
dropping
it
before
lal
this
you
will
give
to
cassca
that
she
may
make
a
curtain
for
the
mother
home
see
it
is
white
and
so
rare
that
the
mother
will
be
pleased
with
such
a
fine
gift
and
you
will
tell
her
all
that
has
chanced
and
how
you
believe
in
her
powers
over
the
powers
of
lurgha
and
the
mother
will
be
well
pleased
with
you
but
you
shall
say
nothing
to
the
men
of
the
village
for
this
quarrel
is
between
lurgha
and
assha
now
and
not
for
the
meddling
of
others
he
unfastened
the
rope
which
bound
lal
arms
lal
reached
out
a
hand
to
the
wolf
skin
his
eyes
filled
with
wonderment
this
is
a
fine
thing
you
give
me
assha
and
the
mother
will
be
pleased
for
in
many
years
she
has
not
had
such
a
curtain
for
her
secret
place
also
i
am
but
a
little
man
the
quarrels
of
great
ones
are
not
for
me
since
lurgha
has
accepted
your
words
this
is
none
of
my
affair
yet
i
will
not
go
back
to
the
village
for
a
while
with
your
permission
assha
for
i
am
a
man
of
loose
and
wagging
tongue
and
oftentimes
i
speak
what
i
do
not
really
wish
to
say
so
if
i
am
asked
questions
i
answer
if
i
am
not
there
to
be
asked
such
questions
i
can
not
answer
mcneil
laughed
and
ashe
smiled
well
enough
lal
perhaps
you
are
a
wiser
man
than
you
think
but
also
i
do
not
believe
you
should
stay
here
the
tribesman
was
already
nodding
that
do
i
say
too
assha
you
are
now
facing
the
wrath
of
lurgha
and
with
that
i
wish
no
part
thus
i
shall
go
into
the
marsh
for
a
while
there
are
birds
and
hares
to
hunt
and
i
shall
work
upon
this
fine
skin
so
that
when
i
take
it
to
the
mother
it
shall
indeed
be
a
gift
worth
her
smiles
now
assha
i
would
go
before
the
night
comes
if
it
pleases
you
go
with
good
fortune
lal
ashe
stood
apart
while
the
tribesman
ducked
his
head
in
a
shy
awkward
farewell
to
the
others
pattering
out
into
the
valley
what
if
they
pick
him
up
mcneil
asked
wearily
i
do
think
they
can
ashe
returned
and
what
would
you
do
keep
him
here
if
we
tried
that
he
scheme
to
escape
and
try
to
turn
the
tables
on
us
now
he
keep
away
from
nodren
village
and
out
of
sight
for
the
time
being
lal
not
too
bright
in
some
ways
but
he
a
good
hunter
if
he
has
reason
for
hiding
out
it
take
a
better
hunter
to
track
him
at
least
we
know
now
that
the
reds
are
afraid
they
did
not
make
a
clean
sweep
here
what
happened
mcneil
while
he
was
telling
his
story
in
more
detail
both
ashe
and
ross
worked
on
his
burns
making
him
comfortable
then
ashe
sat
back
as
ross
prepared
food
how
did
they
spot
the
post
ashe
rubbed
his
chin
and
frowned
at
the
fire
only
way
i
can
guess
is
that
they
picked
up
our
post
signal
and
pinpointed
the
source
that
means
they
must
have
been
hunting
us
for
some
time
no
strangers
about
lately
mcneil
shook
his
head
our
cover
was
broken
that
way
sanford
was
a
wonder
if
i
had
known
better
i
would
have
sworn
he
was
born
one
of
the
beaker
folk
he
had
a
network
of
informants
running
all
the
way
from
here
into
brittany
amazing
how
he
was
able
to
work
without
arousing
any
suspicions
i
suppose
his
being
a
member
of
the
smiths
guild
was
a
big
help
he
could
pick
up
a
lot
of
news
from
any
village
where
there
was
one
at
work
and
i
tell
you
mcneil
propped
himself
up
on
his
elbow
to
exclaim
more
vehemently
there
was
a
whisper
of
trouble
from
here
clear
across
the
channel
and
pretty
far
to
the
north
we
were
already
sure
the
south
was
clean
before
we
ever
took
cover
as
beakers
especially
since
their
clans
are
thick
in
spain
ashe
chewed
a
broiled
wing
reflectively
their
permanent
base
with
the
transport
to
be
somewhere
within
the
bounds
of
the
territory
they
hold
in
our
own
time
they
could
plant
it
in
siberia
and
laugh
at
us
mcneil
exploded
no
hope
of
our
getting
in
there
no
ashe
threw
the
stripped
bone
into
the
fire
and
licked
grease
from
his
fingers
then
they
would
be
faced
with
the
old
problem
of
distance
if
what
they
are
exploiting
lay
within
their
modern
boundaries
we
would
never
have
tumbled
to
the
thing
in
the
first
place
what
the
reds
want
must
lie
outside
their
twentieth
century
holdings
a
slender
point
in
our
favor
therefore
they
will
plant
their
shift
point
as
close
to
it
as
they
can
our
transportation
problem
is
more
difficult
than
theirs
will
ever
be
you
know
why
we
chose
the
arctic
for
our
base
it
lies
in
a
section
of
the
world
never
populated
by
other
than
roving
hunters
but
i
wager
anything
you
want
to
name
that
their
point
is
somewhere
in
europe
where
they
have
people
to
contend
with
if
they
are
using
a
plane
they
risk
its
being
seen
i
do
see
why
not
ross
broke
in
these
people
could
possibly
know
what
it
was
lurgha
bird
magic
ashe
shook
his
head
they
must
have
the
worry
as
much
as
we
have
anything
of
our
own
time
has
to
be
hidden
or
disguised
in
such
a
way
that
the
native
who
may
stumble
upon
it
will
never
know
it
is
our
sub
is
a
whale
to
all
appearances
possibly
their
plane
is
a
bird
but
neither
can
bear
too
close
an
examination
we
do
know
what
could
result
from
a
leak
of
real
knowledge
in
this
or
any
primitive
time
how
it
might
change
history
but
ross
advanced
what
he
believed
to
be
the
best
argument
against
that
reasoning
suppose
i
handed
lal
a
gun
and
taught
him
to
use
it
he
could
duplicate
the
weapon
the
technology
required
lies
so
far
beyond
this
age
these
people
could
reproduce
such
a
thing
true
enough
on
the
other
hand
do
belittle
the
ingenuity
of
the
smiths
or
the
native
intelligence
of
men
in
any
era
these
tribesmen
might
not
be
able
to
reproduce
your
gun
but
it
would
set
them
thinking
along
new
lines
we
might
find
that
they
would
think
our
time
right
out
of
being
no
we
dare
not
play
tricks
with
the
past
this
is
the
same
situation
we
faced
immediately
after
the
discovery
of
the
atom
bomb
everybody
raced
to
produce
that
new
weapon
and
then
sat
around
and
shivered
for
fear
we
be
crazy
enough
to
use
it
on
each
other
the
reds
have
made
new
discoveries
which
we
have
to
match
or
we
will
go
under
but
back
in
time
we
have
to
be
careful
both
of
us
or
perhaps
destroy
the
world
we
do
live
in
what
do
we
do
now
mcneil
wanted
to
know
murdock
and
i
came
here
only
for
a
trial
run
it
his
test
the
sub
is
to
call
for
us
about
nine
days
from
now
so
if
we
sit
tight
if
we
sit
tight
mcneil
lay
down
again
they
will
take
us
out
meanwhile
we
have
nine
days
they
spent
three
more
days
in
the
cave
mcneil
was
on
his
feet
and
impatient
to
leave
before
ashe
was
able
to
hobble
well
enough
to
travel
though
ross
and
mcneil
took
turns
at
hunting
and
guard
duty
they
saw
no
signs
that
the
tribesmen
were
tracking
them
apparently
lal
had
done
as
he
promised
withdrawing
to
the
marsh
and
hiding
there
apart
from
his
people
in
the
gray
of
on
the
fourth
day
ashe
wakened
ross
their
fire
had
been
buried
with
earth
and
already
the
cave
seemed
bleak
they
ate
venison
roasted
the
night
before
and
went
out
into
the
chill
of
a
fog
a
little
way
down
the
valley
mcneil
joined
them
out
of
the
mist
from
his
guard
post
keeping
their
pace
to
one
which
favored
ashe
healing
wound
they
made
their
way
inland
in
the
direction
of
the
track
linking
the
villages
crossing
that
road
they
continued
northward
the
land
beginning
to
rise
under
them
far
away
they
heard
the
blatting
of
sheep
the
bark
of
a
dog
in
the
fog
ross
stumbled
in
a
shallow
ditch
beyond
which
lay
a
stubbled
field
ashe
paused
to
look
about
him
his
nostrils
expanding
as
if
he
were
a
hound
smelling
out
their
trail
the
three
went
on
crossing
a
whole
series
of
small
irregular
fields
ross
was
sure
that
the
yield
from
any
of
these
cleared
strips
must
be
scanty
the
fog
was
thickening
ashe
pressed
the
pace
using
his
handmade
crutch
carefully
he
gave
an
audible
sigh
of
relief
when
they
were
faced
at
last
by
two
stone
monoliths
rising
like
pillars
a
third
stone
lay
across
them
forming
a
rude
arch
through
which
they
saw
a
narrow
valley
running
back
into
the
hills
through
the
fog
ross
could
sense
the
eerie
strangeness
of
the
valley
beyond
the
massive
gate
he
would
have
said
that
he
was
not
superstitious
that
he
had
merely
studied
these
tribal
beliefs
as
lessons
he
had
not
accepted
them
yet
now
if
he
had
been
alone
he
would
have
avoided
that
place
and
turned
aside
from
the
valley
for
that
which
waited
within
was
not
for
him
to
his
secret
relief
ashe
paused
by
the
arch
to
wait
the
older
man
gestured
the
other
two
into
cover
ross
obeyed
willingly
though
the
dank
drops
of
condensing
fog
dripped
on
his
cloak
and
wet
his
face
as
he
brushed
against
shrubs
here
were
walls
of
evergreen
plants
and
dwarfed
pines
almost
as
if
this
tunnel
of
greenery
had
been
planted
with
some
purpose
in
mind
once
his
companions
had
concealed
themselves
ashe
called
shrill
but
sweetly
with
a
bird
rising
notes
three
times
he
made
that
sound
before
a
figure
moved
in
the
fog
the
rough
of
its
long
cloak
melting
in
the
wisps
of
mist
down
that
green
tunnel
out
of
the
heart
of
the
valley
the
other
came
a
loop
of
cloak
concealing
the
entire
figure
it
halted
right
in
back
of
the
arch
and
ashe
making
a
gesture
to
the
others
to
stay
where
they
were
faced
the
muffled
stranger
hands
and
feet
of
the
mother
she
who
sows
what
may
be
reaped
outland
stranger
who
is
under
the
wrath
of
lurgha
the
other
mocked
him
in
the
voice
of
cassca
what
do
you
want
outlander
that
you
dare
to
come
here
where
no
man
may
enter
that
which
you
know
for
on
the
night
when
lurgha
came
you
also
saw
ross
heard
the
hiss
of
a
sharply
drawn
breath
how
knew
you
that
outlander
because
you
serve
the
mother
and
you
are
jealous
for
her
and
her
service
if
lurgha
is
a
mighty
god
you
wanted
to
see
his
acts
with
your
own
eyes
when
she
finally
answered
there
was
anger
as
well
as
frustration
in
her
voice
and
you
know
of
my
shame
then
assha
for
lurgha
came
on
a
bird
he
came
and
he
did
even
as
he
said
he
would
so
now
the
village
will
make
offerings
to
lurgha
and
beg
his
favor
and
the
mother
will
no
more
have
those
to
harken
to
her
words
and
offer
her
the
first
fruits
but
from
whence
came
this
bird
which
was
lurgha
can
you
tell
me
that
she
who
waits
upon
the
mother
what
difference
does
it
make
from
what
direction
lurgha
came
that
does
not
add
nor
take
from
his
power
cassca
moved
beneath
the
arch
or
does
it
in
some
strange
way
assha
perhaps
it
does
only
tell
me
she
turned
slowly
and
pointed
over
her
right
shoulder
from
that
way
he
came
assha
well
did
i
watch
knowing
that
i
was
the
mother
and
that
even
lurgha
thunderbolts
could
not
eat
me
up
does
knowing
that
make
lurgha
smaller
in
your
eyes
assha
when
he
has
eaten
up
all
that
is
yours
and
your
kin
with
it
perhaps
assha
repeated
i
do
not
think
lurgha
will
come
so
again
she
shrugged
and
the
heavy
cloak
flapped
that
shall
be
as
it
shall
be
assha
now
go
for
it
is
not
good
that
any
man
come
hither
cassca
paced
back
into
the
heart
of
the
green
tunnel
and
ross
and
mcneil
came
out
of
concealment
mcneil
faced
in
the
direction
she
had
pointed
northeast
he
commented
thoughtfully
the
baltic
lies
in
that
quarter
chapter
and
that
is
about
all
ten
days
later
ashe
a
dressing
on
his
leg
and
a
few
of
the
pain
lines
smoothed
from
his
face
sat
on
a
bunk
in
the
arctic
time
post
nursing
a
mug
of
coffee
in
his
hands
and
smiling
a
little
crookedly
at
nelson
millaird
millaird
kelgarries
webb
all
the
top
brass
of
the
project
had
not
only
come
through
the
transfer
point
to
meet
the
three
from
britain
but
were
now
crammed
into
the
room
nearly
pushing
ross
and
mcneil
through
the
wall
because
this
was
it
what
they
had
hunted
for
months
years
now
lay
almost
within
their
grasp
only
millaird
the
director
did
not
seem
so
confident
a
big
man
with
a
bushy
thatch
of
coarse
graying
hair
and
a
heavy
fleshy
face
he
did
not
look
like
a
brain
yet
ross
had
been
on
the
roster
long
enough
to
know
that
it
was
millaird
thick
and
hairy
hands
that
gathered
together
all
the
loose
threads
of
operation
retrograde
and
deftly
wove
them
into
a
workable
pattern
now
the
director
leaned
back
in
a
chair
which
was
too
small
for
his
bulk
chewing
thoughtfully
on
a
toothpick
so
we
have
the
first
whiff
of
a
trail
he
commented
without
elation
a
pretty
strong
lead
kelgarries
broke
in
too
excited
to
sit
still
the
major
stood
with
his
back
against
the
door
as
alert
as
if
he
were
about
to
turn
and
face
the
enemy
the
reds
would
have
moved
against
gog
if
they
did
not
consider
it
a
menace
to
them
their
big
base
must
be
in
this
time
sector
big
base
millaird
corrected
the
one
we
are
after
no
and
right
now
they
may
be
switching
times
do
you
think
they
will
sit
here
and
wait
for
us
to
show
up
in
force
but
millaird
tone
intended
to
deflate
had
no
effect
on
the
major
and
just
how
long
would
it
take
them
to
dismantle
a
big
base
that
officer
countered
at
least
a
month
if
we
shoot
a
team
in
there
in
a
hurry
millaird
folded
his
huge
hands
over
his
body
and
laughed
without
a
trace
of
humor
just
where
do
we
send
that
team
kelgarries
northeast
of
a
coastal
point
in
britain
is
a
rather
vague
direction
to
say
the
least
not
he
spoke
to
ashe
now
that
you
did
do
all
you
could
ashe
and
you
mcneil
nothing
to
add
no
sir
they
jumped
us
out
of
the
blue
when
sandy
thought
he
had
every
possible
line
tapped
every
safeguard
working
i
do
know
how
they
caught
on
to
us
unless
they
located
our
beam
to
this
post
if
so
they
must
have
been
deliberately
hunting
us
for
some
time
because
we
only
used
the
beam
as
scheduled
the
reds
have
patience
and
brains
and
probably
some
more
of
their
surprise
gadgets
to
help
them
we
have
the
patience
and
the
brains
but
not
the
gadgets
and
time
is
against
us
get
anything
out
of
this
webb
millaird
asked
the
hitherto
silent
third
member
of
his
ruling
committee
the
quiet
man
adjusted
his
glasses
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
a
flattish
nose
which
did
not
support
them
very
well
just
another
point
to
add
to
our
surmises
i
would
say
that
they
are
located
somewhere
near
the
baltic
sea
there
are
old
trade
routes
there
and
in
our
own
time
it
is
a
territory
closed
to
us
we
never
did
know
too
much
about
that
section
of
europe
their
installation
may
be
close
to
the
finnish
border
they
could
disguise
their
modern
station
under
half
a
dozen
covers
that
is
strange
country
millaird
hands
unfolded
and
he
produced
a
notebook
and
pen
from
a
shirt
pocket
wo
hurt
to
stir
up
some
of
the
agents
of
the
and
the
rest
they
might
just
come
up
with
a
useful
hint
so
you
say
the
baltic
but
that
is
a
big
slice
of
country
webb
nodded
we
have
one
advantage
the
old
trade
routes
in
the
beaker
period
they
are
pretty
well
marked
the
major
one
into
that
section
was
established
for
the
amber
trade
the
country
is
forested
but
not
so
heavily
as
it
was
in
an
earlier
period
the
native
tribes
are
mostly
roving
hunters
and
fishermen
along
the
coast
but
they
have
had
contact
with
traders
he
shoved
his
glasses
back
into
place
with
a
nervous
gesture
the
reds
may
run
into
trouble
themselves
there
at
this
time
how
kelgarries
demanded
invasion
of
the
ax
people
if
they
have
not
yet
arrived
they
are
due
very
soon
they
formed
one
of
the
big
waves
of
migratory
people
who
flooded
the
country
settled
there
eventually
they
became
the
norse
or
celtic
stock
we
do
know
whether
they
stamped
out
the
native
tribes
they
found
there
or
assimilated
them
that
might
be
a
nice
point
to
have
settled
more
definitely
mcneil
commented
it
could
mean
the
difference
between
getting
your
skull
split
and
continuing
to
breathe
i
do
think
they
would
tangle
with
the
traders
evidence
found
today
suggests
that
the
beaker
folk
simply
went
on
about
their
business
in
spite
of
a
change
in
customers
webb
returned
unless
they
were
pushed
into
violence
ashe
handed
his
empty
mug
to
ross
do
forget
lurgha
wrath
from
now
on
our
enemies
might
take
a
very
dim
view
of
any
beaker
trade
posts
near
their
property
webb
shook
his
head
slowly
a
wholesale
attack
on
beaker
establishments
would
constitute
a
shift
in
history
the
reds
wo
dare
that
not
just
on
general
suspicion
remember
they
are
not
any
more
eager
to
tinker
with
history
than
we
are
no
they
will
watch
for
us
we
will
have
to
stop
communication
by
radio
we
ca
snapped
millaird
vehemently
we
can
cut
it
down
but
i
wo
send
the
boys
out
without
some
means
of
quick
communication
you
lab
boys
put
your
brains
to
work
and
see
what
you
can
turn
out
in
the
way
of
talk
boxes
that
they
ca
snoop
time
he
drummed
on
his
knee
with
his
thick
fingers
it
all
comes
back
to
a
question
of
time
which
we
do
not
have
ashe
observed
in
his
usual
quiet
voice
if
the
reds
are
afraid
they
have
been
spotted
they
must
be
dismantling
their
post
right
now
working
around
the
clock
we
never
again
have
such
a
good
chance
to
nail
them
we
must
move
now
millaird
lids
drooped
almost
shut
he
might
have
been
napping
kelgarries
stirred
restlessly
by
the
door
and
webb
round
face
had
settled
into
what
looked
like
permanent
lines
of
disapproval
doc
millaird
spoke
over
his
shoulder
to
the
fourth
man
of
his
following
what
is
your
report
ashe
must
be
under
treatment
for
at
least
five
days
mcneil
burns
are
too
bad
and
murdock
slash
is
almost
healed
five
days
millaird
droned
and
then
flashed
a
glance
at
the
major
personnel
we
tied
down
without
any
useful
personnel
who
in
processing
could
be
switched
without
tangling
them
up
entirely
no
one
i
can
recall
jansen
and
van
wyke
these
ax
people
might
be
a
good
cover
for
them
the
momentary
light
in
kelgarries
eyes
faded
no
we
have
no
proper
briefing
and
ca
get
it
until
the
tribe
does
appear
on
the
map
i
wo
send
any
men
in
cold
their
blunders
would
not
only
endanger
them
but
might
menace
the
whole
project
so
that
leaves
us
with
you
three
millaird
said
we
recall
what
men
we
can
and
brief
them
again
as
fast
as
possible
but
you
know
how
long
that
will
take
in
the
meantime
ashe
spoke
directly
to
webb
you
ca
pinpoint
the
region
closer
than
just
the
baltic
we
can
do
this
much
the
other
answered
him
slowly
and
with
obvious
reluctance
we
can
send
the
sub
cruising
offshore
there
for
the
next
five
days
if
there
is
any
radio
activity
any
communication
we
should
be
able
to
trace
the
beams
it
all
depends
upon
whether
the
reds
have
any
parties
operating
from
their
post
flimsy
but
something
kelgarries
seized
upon
it
with
the
relief
of
one
who
needed
action
and
they
will
be
waiting
for
just
such
a
move
on
our
part
webb
continued
deliberately
all
right
so
they
be
watching
the
major
said
about
to
lose
his
temper
but
it
is
about
the
only
move
we
can
make
to
back
up
the
boys
when
they
do
go
in
he
whipped
around
the
door
and
was
gone
webb
got
up
slowly
i
will
work
over
the
maps
again
he
told
ashe
we
have
scouted
that
area
and
we
do
dare
send
a
over
it
now
any
trip
in
will
be
a
stab
in
the
dark
when
you
have
only
one
road
you
take
it
ashe
replied
i
be
glad
to
see
anything
you
can
show
me
miles
if
ross
had
believed
that
his
cramming
had
been
a
rigorous
business
he
was
soon
to
laugh
at
that
estimation
since
the
burden
of
the
next
jump
would
rest
on
only
three
of
them
ashe
mcneil
and
himself
they
were
plunged
into
a
whirlwind
of
instruction
until
ross
dazed
and
too
tired
to
sleep
on
the
third
night
believed
that
he
was
more
completely
bewildered
than
indoctrinated
he
said
as
much
sourly
to
mcneil
base
has
pulled
back
three
other
teams
mcneil
replied
but
the
men
have
to
go
to
school
again
and
they
wo
be
ready
to
come
on
for
maybe
three
four
weeks
to
change
runs
means
unlearning
stuff
as
well
as
learning
it
what
about
new
men
do
think
kelgarries
is
out
now
beating
the
bushes
for
some
only
we
have
to
be
fitted
to
the
physical
type
we
are
supposed
to
represent
for
instance
set
a
small
pugnose
among
your
norse
sea
rovers
and
he
going
to
be
noticed
maybe
remembered
too
well
we
ca
afford
to
take
that
chance
so
kelgarries
had
to
discover
men
who
not
only
look
the
part
but
are
also
temperamentally
fitted
for
this
job
you
ca
plant
a
fellow
who
thinks
as
a
seaman
not
a
seaman
you
understand
but
one
whose
mind
works
in
that
pattern
among
a
wandering
tribe
of
cattle
herders
the
protection
for
the
man
and
the
project
lies
in
his
being
fitted
into
the
right
spot
at
the
right
time
ross
had
never
really
thought
of
that
point
before
now
he
realized
that
he
and
ashe
and
mcneil
were
of
a
common
mold
all
about
the
same
height
they
shared
brown
hair
and
light
eyes
ashe
blue
his
own
gray
and
mcneil
hazel
and
they
were
of
similar
build
lean
and
he
had
not
seen
any
of
the
true
beakermen
except
on
the
films
but
now
recalling
those
he
could
see
that
the
three
time
traders
were
of
the
same
general
physical
type
as
the
people
they
used
as
a
cover
it
was
on
the
morning
of
the
fifth
day
while
the
three
were
studying
a
map
webb
had
produced
that
kelgarries
followed
at
his
own
weighty
pace
by
millaird
burst
in
upon
them
we
have
it
this
time
have
the
luck
the
reds
slipped
oh
how
they
slipped
webb
watched
the
major
a
thin
little
smile
pulling
at
his
pursed
mouth
miracles
sometimes
do
happen
he
remarked
i
suppose
the
sub
has
a
fix
for
us
kelgarries
passed
over
the
flimsy
strip
of
paper
he
had
been
waving
as
a
banner
of
triumph
webb
read
the
notation
on
it
and
bent
over
the
map
making
a
mark
with
one
of
those
pencils
which
seemed
to
grow
in
his
breast
pocket
ready
for
use
then
he
made
a
second
mark
well
it
narrows
it
a
bit
he
conceded
ashe
looked
in
turn
and
laughed
i
would
like
to
hear
your
definition
of
sometime
miles
remember
we
have
to
cover
this
on
foot
and
a
difference
of
twenty
miles
can
mean
a
lot
that
mark
is
quite
a
bit
in
from
the
sea
mcneil
offered
his
own
protest
when
he
saw
the
marking
we
do
know
that
country
webb
shoved
his
glasses
back
for
the
hundredth
time
that
morning
i
suppose
we
could
consider
this
critical
condition
red
he
said
in
such
a
dubious
tone
that
he
might
have
been
begging
someone
to
protest
his
statement
but
no
one
did
millaird
was
busy
with
the
map
i
think
we
do
miles
he
looked
to
ashe
you
parachute
in
the
packs
with
which
you
will
be
equipped
are
special
stuff
once
you
have
them
off
sprinkle
them
with
a
powder
miles
will
provide
and
in
ten
minutes
there
wo
be
enough
of
them
left
for
anyone
to
identify
we
have
but
a
dozen
of
these
and
we
ca
throw
them
away
except
in
a
crisis
find
the
base
and
rig
up
the
detector
your
fix
in
this
time
will
be
easy
but
it
is
the
other
end
of
the
line
we
must
have
until
you
locate
that
stick
to
the
job
do
communicate
with
us
until
you
have
it
there
is
the
possibility
ashe
pointed
out
the
reds
may
have
more
than
one
intermediate
post
they
probably
have
played
it
smart
and
set
up
a
series
of
them
to
spoil
a
direct
trace
as
each
would
lead
only
to
another
farther
back
in
time
all
right
if
that
proves
true
just
get
us
the
next
one
back
millaird
returned
from
that
we
can
trace
them
along
if
we
must
send
in
some
of
the
boys
wearing
dinosaur
skins
later
we
to
find
their
primary
base
and
if
that
hunt
goes
the
hard
way
well
we
do
it
the
hard
way
how
did
you
get
the
fix
mcneil
asked
one
of
their
field
parties
ran
into
trouble
and
yelled
for
help
did
they
get
it
the
major
grinned
what
do
you
think
you
know
the
rules
and
the
ones
the
reds
play
by
are
twice
as
tough
on
their
own
men
what
kind
of
trouble
ashe
wanted
to
know
some
kind
of
a
local
religious
dispute
we
do
our
best
with
their
code
but
we
not
a
hundred
per
cent
perfect
in
reading
it
i
gather
they
were
playing
with
a
local
god
and
got
their
fingers
burned
lurgha
again
eh
ashe
smiled
foolish
webb
said
impatiently
that
is
a
silly
thing
to
do
you
were
almost
over
the
edge
of
prudence
yourself
gordon
with
that
lurgha
business
to
use
the
great
mother
was
a
ticklish
thing
to
try
and
you
were
lucky
to
get
out
of
it
so
easily
once
was
enough
ashe
agreed
though
using
it
may
have
saved
our
lives
but
i
assure
you
i
am
not
starting
a
holy
war
or
setting
up
as
a
prophet
ross
had
been
taught
something
of
map
reading
but
mentally
he
could
not
make
what
he
saw
on
paper
resemble
the
countryside
a
few
landmarks
if
there
were
any
outstanding
ones
were
all
he
could
hope
to
impress
upon
his
memory
until
he
was
actually
on
the
ground
landing
there
according
to
millaird
instruction
was
another
experience
he
would
not
have
chosen
of
his
own
accord
to
jump
was
a
matter
of
timing
and
in
the
dark
with
a
measure
of
rain
thrown
in
the
action
was
anything
but
pleasant
leaving
the
plane
in
a
blind
fashion
ross
found
the
descent
into
darkness
one
of
the
worst
trials
he
had
yet
faced
but
he
did
not
make
too
bad
a
landing
in
the
small
parklike
expanse
they
had
chosen
for
their
target
ross
pulled
loose
his
harness
and
chute
dragging
them
to
what
he
judged
to
be
the
center
of
the
clearing
hearing
a
plaintive
bray
from
the
air
he
dodged
as
one
of
the
two
burden
asses
sent
to
join
them
landed
and
began
to
kick
at
its
trappings
the
animals
they
had
chosen
were
the
most
docile
available
and
they
had
been
given
sedation
before
the
jump
so
that
now
feeling
ross
hands
the
donkey
stood
quietly
while
ross
stripped
it
of
its
hanging
straps
rossa
the
sound
of
his
beaker
name
called
through
the
dark
brought
ross
facing
in
the
other
direction
here
and
i
have
one
of
the
donkeys
and
i
the
other
that
was
mcneil
their
eyes
adjusted
to
a
gloom
which
was
not
as
thick
as
it
would
be
in
the
forest
and
they
worked
fast
then
they
dragged
the
parachutes
together
in
a
heap
the
rain
would
webb
had
assured
them
add
to
the
rapid
destruction
wrought
by
the
chemical
he
had
provided
ashe
shook
it
over
the
pile
and
there
was
a
faint
greenish
glow
then
they
moved
away
to
the
woodland
and
made
camp
for
the
balance
of
the
night
so
much
of
their
whole
exploit
depended
upon
luck
and
this
small
part
had
been
successful
unless
some
agent
had
been
stationed
to
watch
for
their
arrival
ross
believed
they
could
not
be
spotted
the
rest
of
their
plan
was
elastic
posing
as
traders
who
had
come
to
open
a
new
station
they
were
to
stay
near
a
river
which
drained
a
lake
and
then
angled
southward
to
the
distant
sea
they
knew
this
section
was
only
sparsely
settled
by
small
tribes
hardly
larger
than
family
clans
these
people
were
generations
behind
the
civilized
level
of
the
villagers
of
britain
roving
hunters
who
followed
the
sweep
of
game
north
or
south
with
the
seasons
along
the
seashore
the
fishermen
had
established
more
permanent
holdings
which
were
slowly
becoming
towns
there
were
perhaps
a
few
hardy
pioneer
farmers
on
the
southern
fringes
of
the
district
but
the
principle
reason
traders
came
to
this
region
was
to
get
amber
and
furs
the
beaker
people
dealt
in
both
now
as
the
three
sheltered
under
the
wide
branches
of
a
towering
pine
ashe
fumbled
with
a
pack
and
brought
out
the
beaker
which
was
the
identifying
mark
of
his
adopted
people
he
measured
into
it
a
portion
of
the
sour
stimulating
drink
which
the
traders
introduced
wherever
they
went
the
cup
passed
from
hand
to
hand
its
taste
unpleasant
on
the
tongue
but
comfortingly
warm
to
one
middle
they
took
turns
keeping
the
watch
until
the
gray
of
false
dawn
became
the
clearer
light
of
morning
after
breakfasting
on
flat
cakes
of
meal
they
packed
the
donkeys
using
the
same
knots
and
cross
lashing
which
were
the
mark
of
real
beaker
traders
their
bows
protected
from
dampness
under
their
cloaks
they
set
out
to
find
the
river
and
their
path
southward
ashe
led
ross
towed
the
donkeys
and
mcneil
brought
up
the
rear
in
the
absence
of
a
path
they
had
to
set
a
ragged
course
keeping
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
until
they
saw
the
end
of
the
lake
woodsmoke
ashe
commented
when
they
had
completed
two
thirds
of
their
journey
ross
sniffed
and
was
able
to
smell
it
too
nodding
to
ashe
mcneil
oozed
into
nothingness
between
the
trees
with
an
ease
murdock
envied
as
they
waited
for
him
to
return
ross
became
conscious
of
another
life
about
them
one
busy
with
its
own
concerns
which
were
in
no
way
those
of
human
beings
except
that
food
and
perhaps
shelter
were
to
be
reckoned
among
them
in
britain
ross
had
known
there
were
others
of
his
kind
about
but
this
was
different
here
he
could
have
believed
it
if
he
had
been
told
he
was
the
first
man
to
walk
this
way
a
squirrel
ran
out
on
a
tree
limb
and
surveyed
the
two
men
with
curious
beady
eyes
then
clung
head
down
on
the
tree
trunk
to
see
them
better
one
of
the
donkeys
tossed
its
head
and
the
squirrel
was
gone
with
a
flirt
of
its
tail
although
it
was
quiet
there
was
a
hum
underneath
the
surface
which
ross
tried
to
analyze
to
identify
the
many
small
sounds
which
went
into
its
making
perhaps
because
he
was
trying
so
hard
he
noted
the
faint
noise
his
hand
touched
ashe
arm
and
a
slight
movement
of
his
head
indicated
the
direction
of
the
sound
then
as
fluidly
as
he
had
melted
into
the
woods
mcneil
returned
company
he
said
in
a
soft
voice
what
kind
tribesmen
but
wilder
than
any
i
seen
even
on
the
tapes
we
are
certainly
out
on
the
fringes
now
these
people
look
about
cave
level
i
do
think
they
ever
heard
of
traders
how
many
three
maybe
four
families
most
of
the
males
must
be
out
hunting
but
there
about
ten
children
and
six
or
seven
women
i
do
think
they
had
good
luck
lately
by
the
look
of
them
maybe
their
luck
and
ours
are
going
to
turn
together
ashe
said
motioning
ross
forward
with
the
donkeys
we
will
circle
about
them
to
the
river
and
then
try
bartering
later
but
i
do
want
to
establish
contact
chapter
not
to
be
too
hopeful
mcneil
rubbed
his
arm
across
his
hot
face
so
far
so
good
after
kicking
from
his
path
some
of
the
branches
ross
had
lopped
from
the
trees
they
had
been
felling
he
went
to
help
his
companion
roll
another
small
log
up
to
a
shelter
which
was
no
longer
temporary
if
there
had
been
any
eyes
other
than
the
woodland
to
spy
upon
them
they
would
have
seen
only
the
usual
procedure
of
the
beaker
traders
busily
constructing
one
of
their
posts
that
they
were
being
watched
by
the
hunters
all
three
were
certain
that
there
might
be
other
spies
in
the
forest
they
had
to
assume
for
their
own
safety
they
might
prowl
at
night
but
in
the
daytime
all
of
the
time
agents
kept
within
the
bounds
of
the
roles
they
were
acting
barter
with
the
head
men
of
the
hunting
clan
had
brought
those
shy
people
into
the
camp
of
the
strangers
who
had
such
wonders
to
exchange
for
tanned
deer
hides
and
better
furs
the
news
of
the
traders
arrival
spread
quickly
during
the
short
time
they
had
been
here
so
that
two
other
clans
had
sent
men
to
watch
the
proceedings
with
the
trade
came
news
which
the
agents
sifted
and
studied
each
of
them
had
a
list
of
questions
to
insert
into
their
conversations
with
the
tribesmen
if
and
when
that
was
possible
although
they
did
not
share
a
common
speech
with
the
forest
men
signs
were
informative
and
certain
nouns
could
be
quickly
learned
in
the
meantime
ashe
became
friendly
with
the
nearest
and
first
of
the
clan
groups
they
discovered
going
hunting
with
the
men
as
an
excuse
to
penetrate
the
unknown
section
they
must
quarter
in
their
search
for
the
red
base
ross
drank
river
water
and
mopped
his
own
hot
face
if
the
reds
traders
he
mused
aloud
what
their
cover
mcneil
shrugged
a
hunting
tribe
fishermen
where
would
they
get
the
women
and
children
the
same
way
they
get
their
men
recruit
them
in
our
own
time
or
in
the
way
lots
of
tribes
grew
during
periods
of
stress
ross
set
down
the
water
jug
you
mean
kill
off
the
men
take
over
their
families
this
was
a
he
found
sickening
although
he
had
always
prided
himself
on
his
toughness
several
times
during
his
training
at
the
project
he
had
been
confronted
by
things
which
shook
his
belief
in
his
own
strong
stomach
and
nerve
it
has
been
done
mcneil
remarked
bleakly
hundreds
of
times
by
invaders
in
this
setup
small
family
clans
widely
scattered
that
move
would
be
very
easy
they
would
have
to
pose
as
farmers
not
hunters
ross
pointed
out
they
could
move
a
base
around
with
them
all
right
so
they
set
up
a
farming
village
oh
i
see
what
you
mean
there
is
any
village
around
here
yet
they
are
here
maybe
underground
how
right
their
guesses
were
they
learned
that
night
when
ashe
returned
a
deer
haunch
on
his
shoulder
ross
knew
him
well
enough
by
now
to
sense
his
preoccupation
you
found
something
a
new
set
of
ghosts
ashe
replied
with
a
strange
little
smile
ghosts
mcneil
pounced
upon
that
the
reds
like
to
play
the
supernatural
angle
do
they
first
the
voice
of
lurgha
and
now
ghosts
what
do
these
ghosts
do
they
inhabit
a
bit
of
mountainous
territory
southeast
of
here
a
stretch
strictly
taboo
for
all
hunters
we
were
following
a
bison
track
until
the
beast
headed
for
the
ghost
country
then
ulffa
called
us
off
in
a
hurry
it
seems
that
the
hunter
who
goes
in
there
after
his
quarry
never
reappears
or
if
he
does
it
in
a
damaged
condition
blown
upon
by
ghosts
and
burned
to
death
that
one
point
he
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
stretched
his
arms
wearily
the
second
is
a
little
more
disturbing
for
us
a
beaker
camp
about
twenty
miles
south
of
here
as
far
as
i
can
judge
was
exterminated
just
a
week
ago
the
message
was
passed
to
me
because
i
was
thought
to
be
a
kinsman
of
the
slain
mcneil
sat
up
done
because
they
were
hunting
us
might
well
be
on
the
other
hand
the
affair
may
have
been
just
one
of
general
precaution
the
ghosts
did
it
ross
wanted
to
know
i
asked
that
no
it
seems
that
strange
tribesmen
overran
it
at
night
at
night
mcneil
whistled
just
so
ashe
tone
was
dry
the
tribes
do
not
fight
that
way
either
someone
slipped
up
in
his
briefing
or
the
reds
are
overconfident
and
do
care
about
the
rules
but
it
was
the
work
of
tribesmen
or
their
counterfeits
there
is
also
a
nasty
rumor
speeding
about
that
the
ghosts
do
not
relish
traders
and
that
they
might
protest
intrusions
of
such
with
penalties
all
around
like
the
wrath
of
lurgha
supplied
ross
there
is
a
certain
repetition
in
this
which
suggests
a
lot
to
the
suspicious
mind
ashe
agreed
i
say
no
more
hunting
expeditions
for
the
present
mcneil
said
it
is
too
easy
to
mistake
a
friend
for
a
deer
and
weep
over
his
grave
afterward
that
is
a
thought
which
entered
my
mind
several
times
this
afternoon
ashe
agreed
these
people
are
deceptively
simple
on
the
surface
but
their
minds
do
not
work
along
the
same
patterns
as
ours
we
try
to
outwit
them
but
it
takes
only
one
slip
to
make
it
fatal
in
the
meantime
i
think
we
better
make
this
place
a
little
more
snug
and
it
might
be
well
to
post
sentries
as
unobtrusively
as
possible
how
about
faking
some
signs
of
a
ruined
camp
and
heading
into
the
blue
ourselves
mcneil
asked
we
could
strike
for
the
ghost
mountains
traveling
by
night
and
ulffa
crowd
would
think
we
were
finished
off
an
idea
to
keep
in
mind
the
point
against
it
would
be
the
missing
bodies
it
seems
that
the
tribesmen
who
raided
the
beaker
camp
left
some
very
distasteful
evidence
of
what
happened
to
the
camp
personnel
and
those
we
ca
produce
to
cover
our
trail
mcneil
was
not
yet
convinced
we
might
be
able
to
fake
something
along
that
line
too
we
may
have
to
fake
nothing
ross
cut
in
softly
he
was
standing
close
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
where
they
were
building
their
hut
his
hand
on
one
of
the
saplings
in
the
palisade
they
had
set
up
so
laboriously
that
day
ashe
was
beside
him
in
an
instant
what
is
it
ross
hours
of
listening
to
the
sounds
of
the
wilderness
were
his
measuring
gauge
now
that
bird
has
never
called
from
inland
before
it
is
the
blue
one
we
seen
fishing
for
frogs
along
the
river
ashe
not
even
glancing
at
the
forest
went
for
the
water
jug
get
your
trail
supplies
he
ordered
their
leather
pouches
which
held
enough
iron
rations
to
keep
them
going
were
always
at
hand
mcneil
gathered
them
from
behind
the
fur
curtain
fronting
their
cabin
again
the
bird
called
its
cry
piercing
and
covering
a
long
distance
ross
could
understand
why
a
careless
man
would
select
it
for
the
signal
he
crossed
the
clearing
to
the
donkeys
shelter
slashing
through
their
nose
halters
probably
the
patient
little
beasts
would
swiftly
fall
victims
to
some
forest
prowlers
but
at
least
they
would
have
their
chance
to
escape
mcneil
his
cloak
slung
about
him
to
conceal
the
ration
bags
picked
up
the
leather
bucket
as
if
he
were
merely
going
down
to
the
river
for
water
and
came
to
join
ross
they
believed
that
they
were
carrying
it
off
well
that
the
camp
must
appear
normal
to
any
lurkers
in
the
woods
but
either
they
had
made
some
slip
or
the
enemy
was
impatient
an
arrow
sped
out
of
the
night
to
flash
across
the
fire
and
ashe
escaped
death
only
because
he
had
leaned
forward
to
feed
the
flames
his
arm
swung
out
and
sent
the
water
in
the
jar
hissing
onto
the
blaze
as
he
himself
rolled
in
the
other
direction
ross
plunged
for
the
brush
with
mcneil
lying
flat
on
the
ground
they
started
to
work
their
way
to
the
river
bank
where
the
open
area
would
make
surprise
less
possible
ashe
he
whispered
and
felt
mcneil
warm
breath
on
his
cheek
as
he
replied
he
make
it
the
other
way
he
the
best
we
have
for
this
sort
of
job
they
made
a
worm
progress
twice
lying
with
dagger
in
hand
while
they
listened
to
a
faint
rustle
which
betrayed
the
passing
of
one
of
the
attackers
both
times
ross
was
tempted
to
rise
and
try
to
cut
off
the
stranger
but
he
fought
down
the
impulse
he
had
learned
a
control
of
himself
that
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
a
few
months
earlier
the
glimmer
of
the
river
was
pale
through
the
clumps
of
bushes
which
sometimes
grew
into
the
flood
in
this
country
winter
still
clung
tenaciously
in
shadowy
places
with
cups
of
leftover
snow
and
there
was
a
bite
in
the
wind
and
water
ross
rose
to
his
knees
with
an
involuntary
gasp
as
a
scream
cut
through
the
night
he
wrenched
around
toward
the
camp
only
to
feel
mcneil
hand
clamp
on
his
forearm
that
was
a
donkey
whispered
mcneil
urgently
come
on
let
go
down
to
that
ford
we
discovered
they
turned
south
daring
now
to
trot
half
bent
to
the
ground
the
river
was
swollen
with
spring
floods
which
were
only
now
beginning
to
subside
but
two
days
earlier
they
had
noticed
a
sandbar
at
one
spot
by
crossing
that
shelf
across
the
bed
they
might
hope
to
put
water
between
them
and
the
unknown
enemy
tonight
it
would
give
them
a
breathing
space
even
though
ross
privately
shrank
from
the
thought
of
plowing
into
the
stream
he
had
seen
trees
swirling
along
in
the
current
only
yesterday
and
to
make
such
a
dash
in
the
dark
from
mcneil
throat
burst
a
startling
sound
which
ross
had
last
heard
in
britain
the
questing
howl
of
a
hunting
wolf
the
cry
was
answered
seconds
later
from
downstream
ashe
they
worked
their
way
along
the
edge
of
the
water
with
continued
care
until
they
came
upon
ashe
at
last
so
much
a
part
of
his
background
that
ross
started
when
the
lump
he
had
taken
for
a
bush
hunched
forward
to
join
them
together
they
made
the
river
crossing
and
turned
south
again
to
head
for
the
mountains
it
was
then
that
disaster
struck
ross
heard
no
birdcall
warning
this
time
though
he
was
on
guard
he
never
sensed
the
approach
of
the
man
who
struck
him
down
from
behind
one
moment
he
had
been
trailing
mcneil
and
ashe
the
next
moment
was
black
nothingness
he
was
aware
of
a
throb
of
pain
which
carried
throughout
his
body
and
then
localized
in
his
head
forcing
open
his
eyes
the
dazzle
of
light
was
like
a
spear
point
striking
directly
into
his
head
intensifying
his
pain
to
agony
he
brought
his
hand
up
to
his
face
and
felt
stickiness
there
assha
he
believed
he
called
that
aloud
but
he
did
not
even
hear
his
own
voice
they
were
in
a
valley
a
wolf
had
attacked
him
out
of
the
bushes
wolf
no
the
wolf
was
dead
but
then
it
came
alive
again
to
howl
on
a
river
bank
ross
forced
his
eyes
open
once
more
enduring
the
pain
of
beams
he
recognized
as
sunshine
he
turned
his
head
to
avoid
the
glare
it
was
hard
to
focus
but
he
fought
to
steady
himself
there
was
some
reason
why
it
was
necessary
to
move
to
get
away
but
away
from
what
and
where
when
ross
tried
to
think
he
could
only
see
muddled
pictures
which
had
no
connection
then
a
moving
object
crossed
his
very
narrow
field
of
vision
passing
between
him
and
a
thing
he
knew
was
a
tree
trunk
a
creature
with
a
red
tongue
hanging
from
its
jaws
it
came
toward
him
growling
low
in
its
throat
and
sniffed
at
his
body
before
barking
in
short
excited
bursts
of
sound
the
noise
hurt
his
head
so
much
that
ross
closed
his
eyes
then
a
shock
of
icy
liquid
thrown
into
his
face
aroused
him
to
make
a
feeble
protest
and
he
saw
hanging
over
him
in
a
strange
way
a
bearded
face
which
he
knew
from
the
past
hands
were
laid
on
him
and
the
roughness
with
which
he
was
moved
sent
ross
spiraling
back
into
the
dark
once
again
when
he
aroused
for
the
second
time
it
was
night
and
the
pain
in
his
head
was
dulled
he
put
out
his
hands
and
discovered
that
he
lay
on
a
pile
of
fur
robes
and
was
covered
by
one
assha
again
he
tried
that
name
but
it
was
not
assha
who
came
in
answer
to
his
feeble
call
the
woman
who
knelt
beside
him
with
a
horn
cup
in
her
hand
had
neatly
braided
hair
in
which
gray
strands
showed
silver
by
firelight
ross
knew
he
had
seen
her
before
but
again
where
and
when
eluded
him
she
slipped
a
sturdy
arm
under
his
head
and
raised
him
while
the
world
whirled
about
the
edge
of
the
horn
cup
was
pressed
to
his
lips
and
he
drank
bitter
stuff
which
burned
in
his
throat
and
lit
a
fire
in
his
insides
then
he
was
left
to
himself
once
again
and
in
spite
of
his
pain
and
bewilderment
he
slept
how
many
days
he
lay
in
the
camp
of
ulffa
tended
by
the
chief
head
wife
ross
found
it
hard
to
reckon
it
was
frigga
who
had
argued
the
tribe
into
caring
for
a
man
they
believed
almost
dead
when
they
found
him
and
who
nursed
ross
back
to
life
with
knowledge
acquired
through
half
a
hundred
exchanges
between
those
wise
women
who
were
the
doctors
and
priestesses
of
these
roaming
peoples
why
frigga
had
bothered
with
the
injured
stranger
at
all
ross
learned
when
he
was
able
to
sit
up
and
marshal
his
bewildered
thoughts
into
some
sort
of
order
the
matriarch
of
the
tribe
thirsted
for
knowledge
that
same
urge
which
had
led
her
to
certain
experiments
with
herbs
had
made
her
consider
ross
a
challenge
to
her
healing
skill
when
she
knew
that
he
would
live
she
determined
to
learn
from
him
all
he
had
to
give
ulffa
and
the
men
of
the
tribe
might
have
eyed
the
metal
weapons
of
the
traders
with
awe
and
avid
desire
but
frigga
wanted
more
than
trade
goods
she
wanted
the
secret
of
the
making
of
such
cloth
as
the
strangers
wore
everything
she
could
learn
of
their
lives
and
the
lands
through
which
they
had
come
she
plied
ross
with
endless
questions
which
he
answered
as
best
he
could
for
he
lay
in
an
odd
dreamy
state
where
only
the
present
had
any
reality
the
past
was
dim
and
far
away
and
while
he
was
now
and
then
dimly
aware
that
he
had
something
to
do
he
forgot
it
easily
the
chief
and
his
men
prowled
the
station
after
the
attackers
had
withdrawn
bringing
back
with
them
a
handful
of
loot
a
bronze
razor
two
skinning
knives
some
fishhooks
a
length
of
cloth
which
frigga
appropriated
ross
eyed
this
spoil
indifferently
making
no
claim
upon
it
his
interest
in
everything
about
him
was
often
blanked
out
by
headaches
which
kept
him
limp
on
his
bed
uncaring
and
stupid
for
hours
or
even
full
days
he
gathered
that
the
tribe
had
been
living
in
fear
of
an
attack
from
the
same
raiders
who
had
wiped
out
the
trading
post
but
at
last
their
scouts
returned
with
the
information
that
the
enemy
had
gone
south
there
was
one
change
of
which
ross
was
not
aware
but
which
might
have
startled
both
ashe
and
mcneil
ross
murdock
had
indeed
died
under
that
blow
which
had
left
him
unconscious
beside
the
river
the
young
man
whom
frigga
had
drawn
back
to
sense
and
a
slow
recovery
was
rossa
of
the
beaker
people
this
same
rossa
nursed
a
hot
desire
for
vengeance
against
those
who
had
struck
him
down
and
captured
his
kinsmen
a
feeling
which
the
family
tribe
who
had
rescued
him
could
well
understand
there
was
the
same
old
urgency
pushing
him
to
try
his
strength
now
to
keep
to
his
feet
even
when
they
were
unsteady
his
bow
was
gone
but
ross
spent
hours
fashioning
another
and
he
traded
his
copper
bracelet
for
the
best
dozen
arrows
in
ulffa
camp
the
jet
pin
from
his
cloak
he
presented
to
frigga
with
all
his
gratitude
now
that
his
strength
was
coming
back
he
could
not
rest
easy
in
the
camp
he
was
ready
to
leave
even
though
the
gashes
on
his
head
were
still
tender
to
the
touch
ulffa
indulgently
planned
a
hunt
southward
and
rossa
took
the
trail
with
the
tribesmen
he
broke
with
the
clan
hunters
when
they
turned
aside
at
the
beginning
of
the
taboo
land
ross
his
own
mind
submerged
and
taken
over
by
his
beaker
cover
hesitated
too
yet
he
could
not
give
up
and
the
others
left
him
there
his
eyes
on
the
forbidden
heights
unhappy
and
tormented
by
more
than
the
headaches
which
still
came
and
went
with
painful
regularity
in
the
mountains
lay
what
he
sought
a
hidden
something
within
his
brain
told
him
that
over
and
over
but
the
mountains
were
taboo
and
he
should
not
venture
into
them
how
long
he
might
have
hesitated
there
if
he
had
not
come
upon
the
trail
ross
did
not
know
but
on
the
day
after
the
hunters
of
clan
left
a
glint
of
sunlight
striking
between
two
trees
pointed
out
a
woodsman
blaze
on
a
third
tree
trunk
the
two
halves
of
ross
memory
clicked
together
for
an
instant
as
he
examined
that
cut
he
knew
that
it
marked
a
trace
and
he
pushed
on
hunting
a
second
cut
and
then
a
third
convinced
that
these
would
lead
him
into
the
unknown
territory
desire
to
explore
overcame
the
grafted
superstitions
of
his
briefing
there
were
other
signs
that
this
was
an
route
a
spring
cleared
of
leaves
and
walled
with
stone
a
couple
of
steps
cut
in
the
turf
on
a
steep
slope
ross
moved
warily
alert
to
any
sound
he
might
not
be
an
expert
woodsman
but
he
was
learning
fast
perhaps
the
faster
because
his
false
memories
now
supplanted
the
real
ones
that
night
he
built
no
fire
crawling
instead
into
the
heart
of
a
rotted
log
to
sleep
awakening
once
to
the
call
of
a
wolf
and
another
time
at
the
distant
crash
of
a
dead
tree
yielding
to
wind
in
the
morning
he
was
about
to
climb
back
to
the
trail
he
had
prudently
left
the
night
before
when
he
saw
five
bearded
men
looking
much
the
same
as
ulffa
people
ross
hugged
the
earth
and
watched
them
pass
out
of
sight
before
he
followed
all
that
day
he
wove
an
trail
behind
the
small
band
sometimes
catching
sight
of
them
as
they
topped
a
rise
well
ahead
or
stopped
to
eat
it
was
late
afternoon
when
he
crept
cautiously
to
the
top
of
a
ridge
and
gazed
down
into
a
valley
there
was
a
town
in
that
valley
sturdy
houses
of
logs
behind
a
stockade
he
had
seen
towns
vaguely
like
it
before
yet
it
had
a
dreamlike
quality
as
if
it
were
not
as
real
as
it
appeared
ross
rested
his
chin
on
his
arms
and
watched
that
town
and
the
people
moving
in
it
some
were
hunters
but
others
dressed
quite
differently
he
started
up
with
a
little
cry
at
the
sight
of
one
of
the
men
who
had
walked
so
swiftly
from
one
house
to
the
next
surely
he
was
a
beaker
trader
his
unease
grew
stronger
with
every
moment
he
watched
but
it
was
the
oddness
he
sensed
in
that
town
which
bothered
him
and
not
any
warning
that
he
himself
was
in
danger
he
had
gotten
to
his
knees
to
see
better
when
out
of
nowhere
a
rope
sang
through
the
air
settling
about
his
chest
with
a
vicious
jerk
which
not
only
drove
the
air
from
his
lungs
but
pinioned
his
arms
tight
to
his
body
chapter
having
been
cuffed
and
battered
into
submission
more
quickly
than
would
have
been
possible
three
weeks
earlier
murdock
now
stood
sullenly
surveying
the
man
who
though
he
dressed
like
a
beaker
trader
persisted
in
using
a
language
ross
did
not
know
we
do
not
play
as
children
here
at
last
the
man
spoke
words
ross
could
understand
you
will
answer
me
or
else
others
shall
ask
the
questions
and
less
gently
i
say
to
you
now
who
are
you
and
from
where
do
you
come
for
a
moment
ross
glowered
across
the
table
at
him
his
inbred
antagonism
to
authority
aroused
by
that
contemptuous
demand
but
then
common
sense
cautioned
his
initial
introduction
to
this
village
had
left
him
bruised
and
with
one
of
his
headaches
there
was
no
reason
to
let
them
beat
him
until
he
was
in
no
shape
to
make
a
break
for
freedom
when
and
if
there
was
an
opportunity
i
am
rossa
of
the
traders
he
returned
eying
the
man
with
a
carefully
measured
stare
i
came
into
this
land
in
search
of
my
kinsmen
who
were
taken
by
raiders
in
the
night
the
man
who
sat
on
a
stool
by
the
table
smiled
slowly
again
he
spoke
in
the
strange
tongue
and
ross
merely
stared
stolidly
back
his
words
were
short
and
explosive
sounding
and
the
man
smile
faded
his
annoyance
grew
as
he
continued
to
speak
one
of
ross
two
guards
ventured
to
interrupt
using
the
beaker
language
from
where
did
you
come
he
was
a
slender
man
not
like
his
companion
who
had
roped
murdock
from
behind
and
was
of
the
bully
breed
able
to
subdue
ross
wildcat
resistance
in
a
very
short
struggle
i
came
to
this
land
from
the
south
ross
answered
after
the
manner
of
my
people
this
is
a
new
land
with
furs
and
the
golden
tears
of
the
sun
to
be
gathered
and
bartered
the
traders
move
in
peace
and
their
hands
are
raised
against
no
man
yet
in
the
darkness
there
came
those
who
would
slay
without
profit
for
what
reason
i
have
no
knowing
the
quiet
man
continued
the
questioning
and
ross
answered
fully
with
details
of
the
past
of
one
rossa
a
beaker
merchant
yes
he
was
from
the
south
his
father
was
gurdi
who
had
a
trading
post
in
the
warm
lands
along
the
big
river
this
was
rossa
first
trip
to
open
new
territory
he
had
come
with
his
father
blood
brother
assha
who
was
a
noted
far
voyager
and
it
was
an
honor
to
be
chosen
as
for
such
a
one
as
assha
with
assha
had
been
macna
one
who
was
also
a
far
trader
though
not
as
noted
as
assha
of
a
certainty
assha
was
of
his
own
race
ross
blinked
at
that
question
one
need
only
to
look
upon
him
to
know
that
he
was
of
trader
blood
and
no
uncivilized
woodsrunner
how
long
had
he
known
assha
ross
shrugged
assha
had
come
to
his
father
post
the
winter
before
and
had
stayed
with
them
through
the
cold
season
gurdi
and
assha
had
mingled
blood
after
he
pulled
gurdi
free
from
the
river
in
flood
assha
had
lost
his
boat
and
trade
goods
in
that
rescue
so
gurdi
had
made
good
his
loss
this
year
detail
by
detail
he
gave
the
story
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
provided
these
details
glibly
sure
that
they
were
true
ross
continued
to
be
haunted
by
an
odd
feeling
that
he
was
indeed
reciting
a
tale
of
adventure
which
had
happened
long
ago
and
to
someone
else
perhaps
that
pain
in
his
head
made
him
think
of
these
events
as
very
colorless
and
far
away
it
would
seem
the
quiet
man
turned
to
the
one
behind
the
table
that
this
is
indeed
one
rossa
a
beaker
trader
but
the
man
looked
impatient
angry
he
made
a
sign
to
the
other
guard
who
turned
ross
around
roughly
and
sent
him
toward
the
door
with
a
shove
once
again
the
leader
gave
an
order
in
his
own
language
adding
a
few
words
more
with
a
stinging
snap
that
might
have
been
a
threat
or
a
warning
ross
was
thrust
into
a
small
room
with
a
hard
floor
and
not
even
a
skin
rug
to
serve
as
a
bed
since
the
quiet
man
had
ordered
the
removal
of
the
ropes
from
ross
arms
he
leaned
against
the
wall
rubbing
the
pain
of
returning
circulation
away
from
his
wrists
and
trying
to
understand
what
had
happened
to
him
and
where
he
was
having
spied
upon
it
from
the
heights
he
knew
it
was
an
ordinary
trading
station
and
he
wanted
to
know
what
they
did
here
also
somewhere
in
this
village
he
hoped
to
find
assha
and
macna
at
the
end
of
the
day
his
captors
opened
the
door
only
long
enough
to
push
inside
a
bowl
and
a
small
jug
he
felt
for
those
in
the
dusk
dipping
his
fingers
into
a
lukewarm
mush
of
meal
and
drinking
the
water
from
the
jug
avidly
his
headache
dulled
and
from
experience
ross
knew
that
this
bout
was
almost
over
if
he
slept
he
would
waken
with
a
clearer
mind
and
no
pain
knowing
he
was
very
tired
he
took
the
precaution
of
curling
up
directly
in
front
of
the
door
so
that
no
one
could
enter
without
arousing
him
it
was
still
dark
when
he
awoke
with
a
curious
urgency
remaining
from
a
dream
he
could
not
remember
ross
sat
up
flexing
his
arms
and
shoulders
to
combat
the
stiffness
which
had
come
with
his
cramped
sleep
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
a
feeling
that
there
was
something
to
be
done
and
that
time
was
his
enemy
assha
gratefully
he
seized
on
that
he
must
find
assha
and
macna
for
the
three
of
them
could
surely
discover
a
way
to
get
out
of
this
village
that
was
what
was
so
important
he
had
been
handled
none
too
gently
and
they
were
holding
him
a
prisoner
but
ross
believed
that
this
was
not
the
worst
which
could
happen
to
him
here
and
he
must
be
free
before
the
worst
did
come
the
question
was
how
could
he
escape
his
bow
and
dagger
were
gone
and
he
did
not
even
have
his
long
cloak
pin
for
a
weapon
since
he
had
given
that
to
frigga
running
his
hands
over
his
body
ross
inventoried
what
remained
of
his
clothing
and
possessions
he
unfastened
the
bronze
still
buckled
in
his
kilt
tunic
swinging
the
length
speculatively
in
one
hand
a
masterpiece
of
craftsmanship
it
consisted
of
patterned
plates
linked
together
with
a
series
of
five
finely
wrought
chains
and
a
front
buckle
in
the
form
of
a
lion
head
its
protruding
tongue
serving
as
a
hook
to
support
a
dagger
sheath
its
weight
promised
a
weapon
of
sorts
which
when
added
to
the
element
of
surprise
might
free
him
by
rights
they
would
be
expecting
him
to
produce
some
opposition
however
it
was
well
known
that
only
the
best
fighters
the
shrewdest
minds
followed
the
traders
roads
it
was
a
proud
thing
to
be
a
trader
in
the
wilderness
a
thought
that
warmed
ross
now
as
he
waited
in
the
dark
for
what
luck
and
of
the
bright
horns
would
send
were
he
ever
to
return
to
gurdi
post
whose
boat
rode
across
the
sky
from
dawn
to
dusk
would
have
a
fine
ox
jars
of
the
first
brewing
and
amber
laid
upon
his
altar
ross
had
patience
which
he
had
learned
from
the
mixed
heritage
of
his
two
pasts
the
real
and
the
false
graft
he
could
wait
as
he
had
waited
many
times
before
quiet
and
with
outward
ease
for
the
right
moment
to
come
it
came
now
with
footsteps
ringing
sharply
halting
before
his
cell
door
with
the
noiseless
speed
of
a
hunting
cat
ross
flung
himself
from
behind
the
door
to
a
wall
where
he
would
be
hidden
from
the
newcomer
for
that
necessary
instant
or
two
if
his
attack
was
to
be
successful
it
must
occur
inside
the
room
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
bar
being
slid
out
of
its
brackets
and
he
poised
himself
the
belt
rippling
from
his
right
hand
the
door
was
opening
inward
and
a
man
stood
silhouetted
against
the
outer
light
he
muttered
looking
toward
the
corner
where
ross
had
thrown
his
single
garment
in
a
roll
which
might
just
resemble
for
the
needed
second
or
two
a
man
curled
in
slumber
the
man
in
the
doorway
took
the
bait
coming
forward
far
enough
for
ross
to
send
the
door
slamming
shut
as
he
himself
sprang
with
the
belt
aimed
for
the
head
there
was
a
startled
cry
cut
off
in
the
middle
as
the
belt
plates
met
flesh
and
bone
in
a
crushing
force
luck
was
with
him
ross
caught
up
his
kilt
and
belted
it
around
him
after
he
had
made
a
hurried
examination
of
the
body
now
lying
at
his
feet
he
was
not
sure
that
the
man
was
dead
but
at
any
rate
he
was
completely
unconscious
ross
stripped
off
the
man
cloak
located
his
dagger
freed
it
from
the
belt
hook
and
snapped
it
on
his
own
then
inch
by
inch
ross
edged
open
the
door
peering
through
the
crack
as
far
as
he
could
see
the
hall
was
empty
so
he
jerked
the
portal
open
and
dagger
in
hand
sprang
out
ready
for
attack
he
closed
the
door
slipping
the
bar
back
into
its
brackets
if
the
man
inside
revived
and
pounded
for
attention
his
own
friends
might
think
it
was
ross
and
delay
investigating
but
the
escape
from
the
cell
was
the
easiest
part
of
what
he
planned
to
do
as
ross
well
knew
to
find
assha
and
macna
in
this
maze
of
rooms
occupied
by
the
enemy
was
far
more
difficult
although
he
had
no
idea
in
which
of
the
village
buildings
they
might
be
confined
this
one
was
the
largest
and
seemed
to
be
the
headquarters
of
the
chief
men
which
meant
it
could
also
serve
as
their
prison
light
came
from
a
torch
in
a
bracket
halfway
down
the
hall
the
wood
burned
smokily
giving
off
a
resinous
odor
and
to
ross
the
glow
was
sufficient
illumination
he
slipped
along
as
close
to
the
wall
as
he
could
ready
to
freeze
at
the
slightest
sound
but
this
portion
of
the
building
might
well
have
been
deserted
for
he
saw
or
heard
no
one
he
tried
the
only
two
doors
opening
out
of
the
hall
but
they
were
secured
on
the
other
side
then
he
came
to
a
bend
in
the
corridor
and
stopped
short
hearing
a
murmur
of
low
voices
if
he
had
used
a
hunter
tricks
of
silent
tread
and
vigilant
wariness
before
ross
was
doubly
on
guard
now
as
he
wriggled
to
a
point
from
which
he
could
see
beyond
that
turn
mere
luck
prevented
him
from
giving
himself
away
a
moment
later
assha
assha
alive
well
apparently
under
no
restraint
was
just
turning
away
from
the
same
quiet
man
who
had
had
a
part
in
interrogation
that
was
surely
assha
brown
hair
his
slender
wiry
body
draped
with
a
beaker
kilt
a
familiar
tilt
of
the
head
convinced
ross
though
he
could
not
see
the
man
face
the
quiet
man
went
down
the
hall
leaving
assha
before
a
door
as
he
passed
through
it
ross
sped
forward
and
followed
him
inside
assha
had
crossed
the
bare
room
and
was
standing
on
a
glowing
plate
in
the
floor
ross
aroused
to
desperate
action
by
some
fear
he
did
not
understand
leaped
after
him
his
left
hand
fell
upon
assha
shoulder
turning
the
man
half
around
as
ross
too
stepped
upon
the
patch
of
luminescence
murdock
had
only
an
instant
to
realize
that
he
was
staring
into
the
face
of
an
astonished
stranger
his
hand
flashed
up
in
an
edgewise
blow
which
caught
the
other
on
the
side
of
the
throat
and
then
the
world
came
apart
about
them
there
was
a
churning
whirling
sickness
which
griped
and
bent
ross
almost
double
across
the
crumpled
body
of
his
victim
he
held
his
head
lest
it
be
torn
from
his
shoulders
by
the
spinning
thing
which
seemed
based
behind
his
eyes
the
sickness
endured
only
for
a
moment
and
some
buried
part
of
mind
accepted
it
as
a
phenomenon
he
had
experienced
before
he
came
out
of
it
gasping
to
focus
his
attention
once
more
on
the
man
at
his
feet
the
stranger
was
still
breathing
ross
stooped
to
drag
him
from
the
plate
and
began
binding
and
gagging
him
with
lengths
torn
from
his
kilt
only
when
his
captive
was
secure
did
he
begin
looking
about
him
curiously
the
room
was
bare
of
any
furnishings
and
now
as
he
glanced
at
the
floor
ross
saw
that
the
plate
had
lost
its
glow
the
beaker
trader
rossa
rubbed
sweating
palms
on
his
kilt
and
thought
fleetingly
of
forest
ghosts
and
other
mysteries
not
that
the
traders
bowed
to
those
ghosts
which
were
the
plague
of
lesser
men
and
tribes
but
anything
which
suddenly
appeared
and
then
disappeared
without
any
logical
explanation
needed
thinking
on
murdock
pulled
the
prisoner
who
was
now
reviving
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
and
then
went
back
to
the
plate
with
the
persistence
of
a
man
who
refused
to
treat
with
ghosts
and
wanted
something
concrete
to
explain
the
unexplainable
though
he
rubbed
his
hands
across
the
smooth
surface
of
the
plate
it
did
not
light
up
again
his
captive
having
writhed
himself
half
out
of
the
corner
of
the
room
ross
debated
the
wisdom
of
another
silencing
say
a
tap
on
the
skull
with
the
heavy
hilt
of
his
dagger
deciding
against
it
because
he
might
need
a
guide
he
freed
the
victim
ankle
bonds
and
pulled
him
to
his
feet
holding
the
dagger
ready
where
the
man
could
see
it
were
there
any
more
surprises
to
be
encountered
in
this
place
assha
double
would
test
them
first
the
door
did
not
lead
to
the
same
corridor
or
even
the
same
kind
of
corridor
ross
had
passed
through
moments
earlier
instead
they
entered
a
short
passage
with
walls
of
some
smooth
stuff
which
had
almost
the
sheen
of
polished
metal
and
were
sleek
and
cold
to
the
touch
in
fact
the
whole
place
was
chill
chill
as
river
water
in
the
spring
still
herding
the
prisoner
before
him
ross
came
to
the
nearest
door
and
looked
within
to
be
faced
by
incomprehensible
frames
of
metal
rods
and
boxes
rossa
of
the
traders
marveled
and
stared
but
again
he
realized
that
what
he
saw
was
not
altogether
strange
part
of
one
wall
was
a
board
on
which
small
lights
flashed
and
died
to
flash
again
in
winks
of
bright
color
a
mysterious
object
made
of
wire
and
disks
hung
across
the
back
of
a
chair
standing
the
bound
man
lurched
for
the
chair
and
fell
rolling
toward
the
wall
ross
pushed
him
on
until
he
was
hidden
behind
one
of
the
metal
boxes
then
he
made
the
rounds
of
the
room
touching
nothing
but
studying
what
he
could
not
understand
puffs
of
warm
air
came
in
through
grills
near
the
floor
but
the
room
had
the
same
general
chill
as
the
hall
outside
meanwhile
the
lights
on
the
board
had
become
more
active
flashing
on
and
off
in
complex
patterns
ross
now
heard
a
buzzing
as
if
a
swarm
of
angry
insects
were
gathered
for
an
attack
crouching
beside
his
captive
ross
watched
the
lights
trying
to
discover
the
source
of
the
sound
the
buzz
grew
shriller
almost
demanding
ross
heard
the
tramp
of
heavy
footgear
in
the
corridor
and
a
man
entered
the
room
crossing
purposefully
to
the
chair
he
sat
down
and
drew
the
frame
over
his
head
his
hands
moved
under
the
lights
but
ross
could
not
guess
what
he
was
doing
the
captive
at
murdock
side
tried
to
stir
but
ross
hand
pinned
him
quiet
the
shrill
noise
which
had
originally
summoned
the
man
at
the
lights
was
interrupted
by
a
sharp
pattern
of
sounds
and
his
hands
flew
even
more
quickly
while
ross
took
in
every
detail
of
the
other
clothing
and
equipment
he
was
neither
a
shaggy
tribesman
nor
a
trader
he
wore
a
outer
garment
cut
in
one
piece
to
cover
his
arms
and
legs
as
well
as
his
body
and
his
hair
was
so
short
that
his
round
skull
might
have
been
shaven
ross
rubbed
the
back
of
his
wrist
across
his
eyes
experiencing
again
that
dim
other
memory
odd
as
this
man
looked
murdock
had
seen
his
like
before
somewhere
yet
the
background
had
not
been
gurdi
post
on
the
southern
river
where
and
when
had
he
rossa
ever
been
with
such
strange
beings
and
why
could
he
not
remember
it
all
more
clearly
boots
sounded
once
more
in
the
hall
and
another
figure
strode
in
this
one
wore
furs
but
he
too
was
no
woods
hunter
ross
realized
as
he
studied
the
newcomer
in
detail
the
loose
overshirt
of
thick
fur
with
its
hood
thrown
back
the
high
boots
and
all
the
rest
were
not
of
any
primitive
fashioning
and
the
man
had
four
eyes
one
pair
were
placed
normally
on
either
side
of
his
nose
and
the
other
two
and
murky
were
set
above
on
his
forehead
the
man
tapped
the
one
seated
at
the
board
he
freed
his
head
partially
from
the
wire
cage
so
that
they
could
talk
together
in
a
strange
language
while
lights
continued
to
flash
and
the
buzzing
died
away
ross
captive
wriggled
with
renewed
vigor
and
at
last
thrashed
free
a
foot
to
kick
at
one
of
the
metal
installations
the
resulting
clang
brought
both
men
around
the
one
at
the
board
tore
his
head
cage
off
as
he
jumped
to
his
feet
while
the
other
brought
out
a
gun
gun
one
little
fraction
of
ross
mind
wondered
at
his
recognition
of
that
black
thing
and
of
the
danger
it
promised
even
as
he
prepared
for
battle
he
pushed
his
captive
across
the
path
of
the
man
in
fur
and
threw
himself
in
the
other
direction
there
was
a
blast
to
make
a
torment
in
his
head
as
he
hurled
toward
the
door
so
intent
was
ross
upon
escape
that
he
did
not
glance
behind
but
skidded
out
on
his
hands
and
knees
thus
fortunately
presenting
a
poor
target
to
the
third
man
coming
down
the
hall
ross
shoulder
hit
the
newcomer
at
thigh
level
and
they
tangled
in
a
struggling
mass
which
saved
life
as
the
others
burst
out
behind
them
ross
fought
grimly
his
hands
and
feet
moving
in
blows
he
was
not
conscious
of
planning
his
opponent
was
no
easy
match
and
at
last
ross
was
flattened
in
spite
of
his
desperate
efforts
he
was
whirled
over
his
arms
jerked
behind
him
and
cold
metal
rings
snapped
about
his
wrists
then
he
was
rolled
back
to
lie
blinking
up
at
his
enemies
all
three
men
gathered
over
him
barking
questions
which
he
could
not
understand
one
of
them
disappeared
and
returned
with
ross
former
captive
his
mouth
a
straight
line
and
a
light
in
his
eyes
ross
understood
far
better
than
words
you
are
the
trader
prisoner
the
man
who
looked
like
assha
leaned
over
murdock
patches
of
red
on
his
tanned
skin
where
the
gag
and
wrist
bonds
had
been
i
am
rossa
son
of
gurdi
of
the
traders
ross
returned
meeting
what
he
read
in
the
other
expression
with
a
ready
defiance
i
was
a
prisoner
yes
but
you
did
not
keep
me
one
for
long
then
nor
shall
you
now
the
man
thin
upper
lip
lifted
you
have
done
yourself
ill
my
young
friend
we
have
a
better
prison
here
for
you
one
from
which
you
shall
not
escape
he
spoke
to
the
other
men
and
there
was
the
ring
of
an
order
in
his
voice
they
pulled
ross
to
his
feet
pushing
him
ahead
of
them
during
the
short
march
ross
used
his
eyes
noticing
things
he
could
not
identify
in
the
rooms
through
which
they
passed
men
called
questions
and
at
last
they
paused
long
enough
ross
firmly
in
the
hold
of
the
guard
for
the
other
two
to
put
on
similar
garments
ross
had
lost
his
cloak
in
the
fight
but
no
fur
shirt
was
given
him
he
shivered
more
and
more
as
the
chill
which
clung
to
that
warren
of
rooms
and
halls
bit
into
his
body
he
was
certain
of
only
one
thing
about
this
place
he
could
not
possibly
be
in
the
crude
buildings
of
the
valley
village
however
he
was
unable
to
guess
where
he
was
and
how
he
had
come
there
finally
they
went
down
a
narrow
room
filled
with
bulky
metal
objects
of
bright
scarlet
or
violet
that
gleamed
weirdly
and
were
equipped
with
rods
along
which
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
ringed
here
was
a
round
door
and
when
one
of
the
guards
used
both
hands
to
tug
it
open
the
cold
that
swept
in
at
them
was
a
frigid
breath
that
burned
as
it
touched
bare
skin
chapter
it
took
ross
a
while
to
learn
that
the
walls
of
this
tunnel
which
were
almost
entirely
opaque
with
dark
objects
showing
dimly
through
them
here
and
there
were
of
solid
ice
a
black
wire
was
hooked
overhead
and
at
regular
intervals
hung
with
lights
which
did
nothing
to
break
the
sensation
of
glacial
cold
about
them
ross
shuddered
every
breath
he
drew
stung
in
his
lungs
his
bare
shoulders
and
arms
and
the
exposed
section
of
thigh
between
kilt
and
boot
were
numb
he
could
only
move
on
stiffly
pushed
ahead
by
his
guards
when
he
faltered
he
guessed
that
were
he
to
lose
his
footing
here
and
surrender
to
the
cold
he
would
forfeit
the
battle
entirely
and
with
it
his
life
he
had
no
way
of
measuring
the
length
of
the
boring
through
the
solid
ice
but
they
were
at
last
fronted
by
another
opening
a
ragged
one
which
might
have
been
hacked
with
an
ax
they
emerged
from
it
into
the
wildest
scene
ross
had
ever
seen
of
course
he
was
familiar
with
ice
and
snow
but
here
was
a
world
surrendered
completely
to
the
brutal
force
of
winter
in
a
strange
abnormal
way
it
was
a
still
dead
world
in
which
nothing
moved
save
the
wind
which
curled
the
drifts
his
guards
covered
their
eyes
with
the
murky
lenses
they
had
worn
pushed
up
on
their
foreheads
within
the
shelter
for
above
them
sunlight
dazzled
on
the
ice
crest
ross
his
eyes
smarting
kept
his
gaze
centered
on
his
feet
he
was
given
no
time
to
look
about
a
rope
was
produced
a
loop
of
it
flipped
in
a
noose
about
his
throat
and
he
was
towed
along
like
a
leashed
dog
before
them
was
a
path
worn
in
the
snow
not
only
by
the
passing
of
booted
feet
but
with
more
deeply
scored
marks
as
if
heavy
objects
had
been
sledded
there
ross
slipped
and
stumbled
in
the
ruts
fearing
to
fall
lest
he
be
dragged
the
numbness
of
his
body
reached
into
his
head
he
was
dizzy
the
world
about
him
misting
over
now
and
again
with
a
haze
which
arose
from
the
long
stretches
of
unbroken
snow
fields
tripping
in
a
rut
he
went
down
upon
one
knee
his
flesh
too
numbed
now
to
feel
the
additional
cold
of
the
snow
snow
so
hard
that
its
crust
delivered
a
knife
cut
unemotionally
he
watched
a
thin
line
of
red
trickle
in
a
sluggish
drop
or
two
down
the
blue
skin
of
his
leg
the
rope
jerked
him
forward
and
ross
scrambled
awkwardly
until
one
of
his
captors
hooked
a
fur
mitten
in
his
belt
and
heaved
him
to
his
feet
once
more
the
purpose
of
that
trek
through
the
snow
was
obscure
to
ross
in
fact
he
no
longer
cared
save
that
a
hard
rebel
core
deep
inside
him
would
not
let
him
give
up
as
long
as
his
legs
could
move
and
he
had
a
scrap
of
conscious
will
left
in
him
it
was
more
difficult
to
walk
now
he
skidded
and
went
down
twice
more
then
the
last
time
he
slipped
he
sledded
past
the
man
who
led
him
sliding
down
the
slope
of
a
slope
he
lay
at
the
foot
unable
to
get
up
through
the
haze
and
deadening
blanket
of
the
cold
he
knew
that
he
was
being
pulled
about
shaken
generally
mishandled
but
this
time
he
could
not
respond
someone
snapped
open
the
rings
about
his
wrists
there
was
a
call
echoing
eerily
across
the
ice
the
fumbling
about
his
body
changed
to
a
tugging
and
once
more
he
was
sent
rolling
down
the
slope
but
the
rope
was
now
gone
from
his
throat
and
his
arms
were
free
this
time
when
he
brought
up
hard
against
an
obstruction
he
was
not
followed
ross
conscious
mind
that
portion
of
him
that
was
rossa
the
trader
was
content
to
lie
there
to
yield
to
the
lethargy
born
of
the
frigid
world
about
him
but
the
subconscious
ross
murdock
of
the
project
prodded
at
him
he
had
always
had
a
certain
cold
hatred
which
could
crystalize
and
become
a
spur
once
it
had
been
hatred
of
circumstances
and
authority
now
it
became
hatred
for
those
who
had
led
him
into
this
wilderness
with
the
purpose
as
he
knew
now
of
leaving
him
to
freeze
and
die
ross
pulled
his
hands
under
him
though
there
was
no
feeling
in
them
they
obeyed
his
will
clumsily
he
levered
himself
up
and
looked
around
he
lay
in
a
narrow
crevicelike
cut
partly
walled
in
by
earth
so
frozen
as
to
resemble
steel
crusted
over
it
in
long
streaks
from
above
were
tongues
of
ice
to
remain
here
was
to
serve
his
captors
purpose
ross
inched
his
way
to
his
feet
this
opening
which
was
intended
as
his
grave
was
not
so
deep
as
the
men
had
thought
it
in
their
hurry
to
be
rid
of
him
he
believed
that
he
could
climb
out
if
he
could
make
his
body
answer
to
his
determination
somehow
ross
made
that
supreme
effort
and
came
again
to
the
rutted
path
from
which
they
had
tumbled
him
even
if
he
could
there
was
no
sense
in
going
along
that
rutted
trail
for
it
led
back
to
the
building
from
which
he
had
been
brought
they
had
thrust
him
out
to
die
they
would
not
take
him
in
but
a
road
so
well
marked
must
have
some
goal
and
in
hopes
that
he
might
find
shelter
at
the
other
end
ross
turned
to
the
left
the
trace
continued
down
the
slope
now
the
towering
walls
of
ice
and
snow
were
broken
by
rocky
teeth
as
if
they
had
bitten
deep
upon
this
land
only
to
be
gnawed
in
return
rounding
one
of
those
rock
fangs
ross
looked
at
a
stretch
of
level
ground
snow
lay
here
but
the
trail
led
straight
through
it
to
the
rounded
side
of
a
huge
globe
half
buried
in
the
ground
a
globe
of
dark
material
which
could
only
be
ross
was
past
caution
he
must
get
to
warmth
and
shelter
or
he
was
done
for
and
he
knew
it
wavering
and
weaving
he
went
on
his
attention
fixed
on
the
door
ahead
a
closed
oval
door
with
a
sob
of
exhausted
effort
ross
threw
himself
against
it
the
barrier
gave
letting
him
fall
forward
into
a
queer
glimmering
radiance
of
bluish
light
the
light
rousing
him
because
it
promised
more
he
crawled
on
past
another
door
which
was
flattened
back
against
the
inner
wall
it
was
like
making
one
way
down
a
tube
ross
paused
pressing
his
lifeless
hands
against
his
bare
chest
under
the
edge
of
his
tunic
suddenly
realizing
that
there
was
warmth
here
his
breath
did
not
puff
out
in
frosty
streamers
before
him
nor
did
the
air
sear
his
lungs
when
he
ventured
to
draw
in
more
than
shallow
gulps
with
that
realization
a
measure
of
animal
caution
returned
to
him
to
remain
where
he
was
just
inside
the
entrance
was
to
court
disaster
he
must
find
a
hiding
place
before
he
collapsed
for
he
sensed
he
was
very
near
the
end
of
his
ability
to
struggle
hope
had
given
him
a
flash
of
false
strength
the
impetus
to
move
and
he
must
make
the
most
of
that
gift
his
path
ended
at
a
wide
ladder
coiling
in
slow
curves
into
gloom
below
and
shadows
above
he
sensed
that
he
was
in
a
building
of
some
size
he
was
afraid
to
go
down
for
even
looking
in
that
direction
almost
finished
his
sense
of
balance
so
he
climbed
up
step
by
step
ross
made
that
painful
journey
passing
levels
from
which
three
or
four
hallways
ran
out
like
the
radii
of
a
spider
web
he
was
close
to
the
end
of
his
endurance
when
he
heard
a
sound
echoed
magnified
from
below
it
was
someone
moving
he
dragged
his
body
into
the
fourth
level
where
the
light
was
very
faint
hoping
to
crawl
far
enough
into
one
of
the
passages
to
remain
unseen
from
the
stair
but
he
had
gone
only
down
his
chosen
road
when
he
collapsed
panting
and
fell
back
against
the
wall
his
hands
pawed
vainly
against
that
sleek
surface
he
was
falling
through
it
ross
had
a
second
perhaps
two
of
stupefied
wonder
lying
on
a
soft
surface
he
was
enfolded
by
a
warmth
which
eased
his
bruised
and
frozen
body
there
was
a
sharp
prick
in
his
thigh
another
in
his
arm
and
the
world
was
a
hazy
dream
until
he
finally
slept
in
the
depths
of
exhaustion
there
were
dreams
detailed
ones
and
ross
stirred
uneasily
as
his
sleep
thinned
to
waking
he
lay
with
his
eyes
closed
fitting
together
odd
bits
of
dreams
no
he
was
certain
that
they
were
memories
rossa
of
the
beaker
traders
and
ross
murdock
of
the
project
were
again
fused
into
one
and
the
same
person
how
it
had
happened
he
did
not
know
but
it
was
true
opening
his
eyes
he
noticed
a
curved
ceiling
of
soft
blue
which
misted
at
the
edges
into
gray
the
restful
color
acted
on
his
troubled
waking
mind
like
a
soothing
word
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
been
struck
down
in
the
night
his
headache
was
gone
he
raised
his
hand
to
explore
that
old
hurt
near
his
hairline
that
had
been
so
tender
only
yesterday
that
it
could
not
bear
pressure
there
remained
only
a
thin
rough
line
like
a
scar
that
was
all
ross
lifted
his
head
to
look
about
him
his
body
lay
supported
in
a
cradlelike
arrangement
of
metal
almost
entirely
immersed
in
a
red
gelatinous
substance
with
a
clean
aromatic
odor
just
as
he
was
no
longer
cold
neither
was
he
hungry
he
felt
as
fit
as
he
ever
had
in
his
life
sitting
up
in
the
cradle
he
stroked
the
jelly
away
from
his
shoulders
and
chest
it
fell
from
him
cleanly
leaving
no
trace
of
grease
or
dampness
on
his
skin
there
were
other
fixtures
in
the
small
cylinderlike
chamber
besides
that
odd
bed
in
which
he
had
lain
two
seats
were
placed
at
the
narrow
fore
part
of
the
room
and
before
those
seats
was
a
system
of
controls
he
could
not
comprehend
as
ross
swung
his
feet
to
the
floor
there
was
a
click
from
the
side
which
brought
him
around
ready
for
trouble
but
the
noise
had
been
caused
by
the
opening
of
a
door
into
a
small
cupboard
inside
the
cupboard
lay
a
fat
package
obviously
this
was
an
invitation
to
investigate
the
offering
the
package
contained
a
much
folded
article
of
fabric
compressed
and
sealed
in
a
transparent
bag
which
he
fumbled
twice
before
he
succeeded
in
releasing
its
fastening
ross
shook
out
a
garment
of
material
such
as
he
had
never
seen
before
its
sheen
and
surface
suggested
metal
but
its
stuff
was
as
supple
as
fine
silk
color
rippled
across
it
with
every
twist
and
turn
he
gave
to
the
length
dark
blue
fading
to
pale
violet
accented
with
wavering
streaks
of
vivid
and
startling
green
ross
experimented
with
a
row
of
small
studs
which
made
a
transverse
line
from
the
right
shoulder
to
the
left
hip
and
they
came
apart
as
he
climbed
into
the
suit
the
stuff
modeled
to
his
body
in
a
tight
but
perfect
fit
across
the
shoulders
were
bands
of
green
to
match
the
studs
and
the
stockinglike
tights
were
soled
with
a
thick
substance
which
formed
a
cushion
for
his
feet
he
pressed
the
studs
together
felt
them
lock
and
then
stood
smoothing
that
strange
beautiful
fabric
unable
to
account
for
either
it
or
his
surroundings
his
head
was
clear
he
could
remember
every
detail
of
his
flight
up
to
the
time
he
had
fallen
through
the
wall
and
he
was
certain
that
he
had
passed
through
not
only
one
but
two
of
the
red
time
posts
could
this
be
the
third
if
so
was
he
still
a
captive
why
would
they
leave
him
to
freeze
in
the
open
country
one
moment
and
then
treat
him
this
way
later
he
could
not
connect
the
building
from
which
the
reds
had
taken
him
with
this
one
at
the
sound
of
another
soft
noise
ross
glanced
over
his
shoulder
just
in
time
to
see
the
cradle
of
jelly
from
which
he
had
emerged
close
in
upon
itself
until
its
bulk
was
a
third
of
its
former
size
compact
as
a
box
it
folded
up
against
the
wall
ross
his
cushioned
feet
making
no
sound
advanced
to
the
but
lowering
his
body
into
one
of
them
for
a
better
look
at
what
vaguely
resembled
the
control
of
a
helicopter
like
the
one
in
which
he
had
taken
the
first
stage
of
his
fantastic
journey
across
space
and
time
he
did
not
find
it
comfortable
he
realized
that
it
had
not
been
constructed
to
accommodate
a
body
shaped
precisely
like
his
own
a
body
like
his
own
that
jelly
bath
or
bed
or
whatever
it
was
the
clothing
which
adapted
so
skillfully
to
his
measurements
ross
leaned
forward
to
study
the
devices
on
the
control
board
confirming
his
suspicions
he
had
made
the
final
jump
of
them
all
he
was
now
in
some
building
of
that
alien
race
upon
whose
existence
millaird
and
kelgarries
had
staked
the
entire
project
this
was
the
source
or
one
of
the
sources
from
which
the
reds
were
getting
the
knowledge
which
fitted
no
modern
pattern
a
world
encased
in
ice
and
a
building
with
strange
machinery
this
thing
a
cylinder
with
a
pilot
seat
and
a
set
of
controls
was
it
an
alien
place
but
the
jelly
bath
and
the
rest
of
it
had
his
presence
activated
that
cupboard
to
supply
him
with
clothing
and
what
had
become
of
the
tunic
he
was
wearing
when
he
entered
ross
got
up
to
search
the
chamber
the
was
folded
against
the
wall
but
there
was
no
sign
of
his
beaker
clothing
his
belt
the
hide
boots
he
could
not
understand
his
own
state
of
well
being
the
lack
of
hunger
and
thirst
there
were
two
possible
explanations
for
it
all
one
was
that
the
aliens
still
lived
here
and
for
some
reason
had
come
to
his
aid
the
other
was
that
he
stood
in
a
place
where
robot
machinery
worked
though
those
who
had
set
it
up
were
no
longer
there
it
was
difficult
to
separate
his
memory
of
the
globe
he
had
seen
from
his
sickness
of
that
moment
yet
he
knew
that
he
had
climbed
and
crawled
through
emptiness
neither
seeing
nor
hearing
any
other
life
now
ross
restlessly
paced
up
and
down
seeking
the
door
through
which
he
must
have
come
but
there
was
not
even
a
line
to
betray
such
an
opening
i
want
out
he
said
aloud
standing
in
the
center
of
the
cramped
room
his
fists
planted
on
his
hips
his
eyes
still
searching
for
the
vanished
door
he
had
tapped
he
had
pushed
he
had
tried
every
possible
way
to
find
it
if
he
could
only
remember
how
he
had
come
in
but
all
he
could
recall
was
leaning
against
a
wall
which
moved
inward
and
allowed
him
to
fall
but
where
had
he
fallen
into
that
jelly
bath
ross
stung
by
a
sudden
idea
glanced
at
the
ceiling
it
was
low
enough
so
that
by
standing
on
tiptoes
he
could
drum
his
fingers
on
its
surface
now
he
moved
to
the
place
directly
above
where
the
cradle
had
swung
before
it
had
folded
itself
away
rapping
and
poking
his
efforts
were
rewarded
at
last
the
blue
curve
gave
under
his
assault
he
pushed
now
rising
on
his
toes
though
in
that
position
he
could
exert
little
pressure
then
as
if
some
faulty
catch
had
been
released
the
ceiling
swung
up
so
that
he
lost
his
footing
and
would
have
fallen
had
he
not
caught
the
back
of
one
of
the
he
jumped
and
by
hooking
his
hands
over
the
edge
of
the
opening
was
able
to
work
his
way
up
and
out
to
face
a
small
line
of
light
his
fingers
worked
at
that
and
he
opened
a
second
door
entering
a
familiar
corridor
holding
the
door
open
ross
looked
back
his
eyes
widening
at
what
he
saw
for
it
was
plain
now
that
he
had
just
climbed
out
of
a
machine
with
the
unmistakable
outline
of
a
rocket
the
small
flyer
or
a
jet
or
whatever
it
was
had
been
fitted
into
a
pocket
in
the
side
of
the
big
structure
as
a
ship
into
a
berth
and
it
must
have
been
set
there
to
shoot
from
that
enclosing
chamber
as
a
bullet
is
shot
from
a
rifle
barrel
but
why
ross
imagination
jumped
from
fact
to
theory
the
torpedo
craft
could
be
an
atomic
jet
all
right
he
had
been
in
bad
shape
when
he
fell
into
it
by
chance
and
the
bed
machine
had
caught
him
as
if
it
had
been
created
for
just
such
a
duty
what
kind
of
a
small
plane
would
be
equipped
with
a
restorative
apparatus
only
one
intended
to
handle
emergencies
to
transport
badly
injured
living
things
who
had
to
leave
the
building
in
a
hurry
in
other
words
a
lifeboat
but
why
would
a
building
need
a
lifeboat
that
would
be
rather
standard
equipment
for
a
ship
ross
stepped
into
the
corridor
and
stared
about
him
with
open
and
incredulous
wonder
could
this
be
some
form
of
ship
grounded
here
deserted
and
derelict
and
now
being
plundered
by
the
reds
the
facts
fitted
they
fitted
so
well
with
all
he
had
been
able
to
discover
that
ross
was
sure
it
was
true
but
he
determined
to
prove
it
beyond
all
doubt
he
closed
the
door
leading
to
the
lifeboat
berth
but
not
so
securely
that
he
could
not
open
it
again
that
was
too
good
a
hiding
place
on
his
cushioned
feet
he
padded
back
to
the
stairway
and
he
stood
there
listening
far
below
were
sounds
a
rasp
of
metal
against
metal
a
low
murmur
of
muted
voices
but
from
above
there
was
nothing
so
he
would
explore
above
before
he
ventured
into
that
other
danger
zone
ross
climbed
passing
two
more
levels
to
come
out
into
a
vast
room
with
a
curving
roof
which
must
fill
the
whole
crown
of
the
globe
here
was
such
a
wealth
of
machines
controls
things
he
could
not
understand
that
he
stood
bewildered
content
for
the
moment
merely
to
look
there
were
he
counted
slowly
five
control
boards
like
those
he
had
seen
in
the
small
escape
ship
each
of
these
was
faced
by
two
or
three
of
the
only
these
swung
in
webbing
he
put
his
hand
on
one
and
it
bobbed
elastically
the
control
boards
were
so
complicated
that
the
one
in
the
lifeboat
might
have
been
a
child
toy
in
comparison
the
air
in
the
ship
had
been
good
in
the
lifeboat
it
had
held
the
pleasant
odor
of
the
jelly
but
here
ross
sniffed
a
faint
but
persistent
hint
of
corruption
of
an
old
malodor
he
left
the
vantage
point
by
the
stairs
and
paced
between
the
control
boards
and
their
empty
swinging
seats
this
was
the
main
control
room
of
that
he
was
certain
from
this
point
all
the
vast
bulk
beneath
him
had
been
set
in
motion
sailed
here
and
there
had
it
been
on
the
sea
or
through
the
air
the
globe
shape
suggested
an
craft
but
a
civilization
so
advanced
as
this
would
surely
have
left
some
remains
ross
was
willing
to
believe
that
he
could
be
much
farther
back
in
time
than
but
he
was
still
sure
that
traces
of
those
who
could
build
a
thing
like
this
would
have
existed
in
the
twentieth
century
maybe
that
was
how
the
reds
had
found
this
something
they
had
turned
up
within
their
country
say
in
siberia
or
some
of
the
forgotten
corners
of
asia
had
been
a
clue
having
had
little
schooling
other
than
the
intensive
cramming
at
the
base
and
his
own
informal
education
the
idea
of
the
race
who
had
created
this
ship
overawed
ross
more
than
he
would
admit
if
the
project
could
find
this
turn
loose
on
it
the
guys
who
knew
about
such
things
but
that
was
just
what
they
were
striving
for
and
he
was
the
only
project
man
to
have
found
the
prize
somehow
someway
he
had
to
get
back
out
of
this
ship
and
its
icebound
world
back
to
where
he
could
find
his
own
people
perhaps
the
job
was
impossible
but
he
had
to
try
his
survival
was
considered
impossible
by
the
men
who
had
thrown
him
into
the
crevice
but
here
he
was
thanks
to
the
men
who
had
built
this
ship
he
was
alive
and
well
ross
sat
down
in
one
of
the
uncomfortable
seats
to
think
and
thus
avoided
immediate
disaster
for
he
was
hidden
from
the
stairs
on
which
sounded
the
tap
of
boots
a
climber
maybe
two
were
on
their
way
up
and
there
was
no
other
exit
from
the
control
cabin
chapter
ross
dropped
from
the
chair
to
the
floor
and
made
himself
as
small
as
possible
under
the
platform
at
the
front
of
the
cabin
here
where
there
was
a
smaller
control
board
and
two
seats
placed
closely
together
the
odd
unpleasant
odor
clung
and
became
stronger
to
senses
as
he
waited
tensely
for
the
climbers
to
appear
though
he
had
searched
there
was
nothing
in
sight
even
faintly
resembling
a
weapon
in
a
last
desperate
bid
for
freedom
he
crept
back
to
the
stairwell
he
had
been
taught
a
blow
during
his
training
period
one
which
required
a
precise
delivery
and
he
had
been
warned
was
often
fatal
he
would
use
it
now
the
climber
was
very
close
a
cropped
head
arose
through
the
floor
opening
and
ross
struck
knowing
as
his
hand
chopped
against
the
folds
of
a
fur
hood
that
he
had
failed
but
the
impetus
of
that
unexpected
blow
saved
him
after
all
with
a
choked
cry
the
man
disappeared
crashing
down
upon
the
one
following
him
a
scream
and
shouts
were
heard
from
below
and
a
shot
ripped
up
the
well
as
ross
scrambled
away
from
it
he
might
have
delayed
the
final
battle
but
they
had
him
cornered
he
faced
that
fact
bleakly
they
need
only
sit
below
and
let
nature
take
its
course
his
session
in
the
lifeboat
had
restored
his
strength
but
a
man
could
not
live
forever
without
food
and
water
however
he
had
bought
himself
perhaps
a
yard
of
time
which
must
be
put
to
work
turning
to
examine
the
seats
ross
discovered
that
they
could
be
unhooked
from
their
webbing
swings
freeing
all
of
them
he
dragged
their
weight
to
the
stairwell
and
jammed
them
together
to
make
a
barricade
it
could
not
hold
long
against
any
determined
push
from
below
but
he
hoped
it
would
deflect
bullets
if
some
sharpshooter
tried
to
wing
him
by
ricochet
every
so
often
there
was
the
crash
of
a
shot
and
some
shouting
but
ross
was
not
going
to
be
drawn
out
of
cover
by
that
he
paced
around
the
control
cabin
still
hunting
for
a
weapon
the
symbols
on
the
levers
and
buttons
were
meaningless
to
him
they
made
him
feel
frustrated
because
he
imagined
that
among
that
countless
array
were
some
that
might
help
him
out
of
the
trap
if
he
could
only
guess
their
use
once
more
he
stood
by
the
platform
thinking
this
was
the
point
from
which
the
ship
had
been
sailed
in
the
air
or
on
some
now
frozen
sea
these
control
boards
must
have
given
the
ship
master
the
means
not
only
of
propelling
the
vast
bulk
but
of
unloading
and
loading
cargo
lighting
heating
ventilation
and
perhaps
defense
of
course
every
control
might
be
dead
now
but
he
remembered
that
in
the
lifeboat
the
machines
had
worked
successfully
fulfilled
expertly
the
duty
for
which
they
had
been
constructed
the
only
step
remaining
was
to
try
his
luck
having
made
his
decision
ross
simply
shut
his
eyes
as
he
had
in
a
very
short
and
almost
forgotten
childhood
turned
around
three
times
and
pointed
then
he
looked
to
see
where
luck
had
directed
him
his
finger
indicated
a
board
before
which
there
had
been
three
seats
and
he
crossed
to
it
slowly
with
a
sense
that
once
he
touched
the
controls
he
might
inaugurate
a
chain
of
events
he
could
not
stop
the
crash
of
a
shot
underlined
the
fact
that
he
had
no
other
recourse
since
the
symbols
meant
nothing
ross
concentrated
on
the
shapes
of
the
various
devices
and
chose
one
which
vaguely
resembled
the
type
of
light
switch
he
had
always
known
since
it
was
up
he
pressed
it
down
counting
to
twenty
slowly
as
he
waited
for
a
reaction
below
the
switch
was
an
oval
button
marked
with
two
wiggles
and
a
double
dot
in
red
ross
snapped
it
level
with
the
panel
and
when
it
did
not
snap
back
he
felt
somehow
encouraged
when
the
two
levers
flanking
that
button
did
not
push
in
or
move
up
and
down
ross
pulled
them
out
without
even
waiting
to
count
off
this
time
he
had
results
a
crackling
of
noise
with
a
singsong
rhythm
the
volume
of
which
low
at
first
arose
to
a
drone
filled
the
cabin
ross
deafened
by
the
din
twisted
first
one
lever
and
then
the
other
until
he
had
brought
the
sound
to
a
less
piercing
howl
but
he
needed
action
not
just
noise
he
moved
from
behind
the
first
chair
to
the
next
one
here
were
five
oval
buttons
marked
in
the
same
vivid
green
as
that
which
trimmed
his
clothing
two
wiggles
a
dot
a
double
bar
a
pair
of
entwined
circles
and
a
crosshatch
why
make
a
choice
recklessness
bubbled
to
the
surface
and
ross
pushed
all
the
buttons
in
rapid
succession
the
results
were
in
a
measure
spectacular
out
of
the
top
of
the
control
board
rose
a
triangle
of
screen
which
steadied
and
stood
firm
while
across
it
played
a
rippling
wave
of
color
meanwhile
the
singsong
became
an
angry
squawking
as
if
in
protest
well
he
had
something
even
if
he
did
know
what
it
was
and
he
had
also
proved
that
the
ship
was
alive
however
ross
wanted
more
than
a
squawk
of
exasperation
which
was
exactly
what
the
noise
had
become
it
almost
sounded
ross
decided
as
he
listened
as
if
he
were
being
expertly
chewed
out
in
another
language
yes
he
wanted
more
than
a
series
of
squawks
and
a
fanciful
display
of
light
waves
on
a
screen
at
the
section
of
board
before
the
third
and
last
seat
there
was
less
choice
only
two
switches
as
ross
flicked
up
the
first
the
pattern
on
the
screen
dwindled
into
a
brown
color
shot
with
cream
in
which
there
was
a
suggestion
of
a
picture
suppose
one
did
put
the
switch
all
the
way
up
ross
examined
the
slot
in
which
the
bar
moved
and
now
noted
a
series
of
tiny
point
marks
along
it
selective
it
would
not
do
any
harm
to
see
first
he
hurried
back
to
the
cork
of
chairs
he
had
jammed
into
the
stairwell
the
squawks
were
now
coming
only
at
intervals
and
ross
could
hear
nothing
to
suggest
that
his
barrier
was
being
forced
he
returned
to
the
lever
and
moved
it
back
two
notches
standing
at
the
immediate
result
the
streaks
were
making
a
picture
moving
another
notch
down
caused
the
picture
to
skitter
back
and
forth
on
the
screen
with
memories
of
tv
tuning
to
guide
him
ross
brought
the
other
lever
down
to
a
matching
position
and
the
dim
and
shadowy
images
leaped
into
clear
and
complete
focus
but
the
color
was
still
brown
not
the
black
and
white
he
had
expected
only
he
was
also
looking
into
a
face
ross
swallowed
his
hand
grasping
one
of
the
strings
of
chair
webbing
for
support
perhaps
because
in
some
ways
it
did
resemble
his
own
that
face
was
more
preposterously
nonhuman
the
visage
on
the
screen
was
sharply
triangular
with
a
small
sharply
pointed
chin
and
a
jaw
line
running
at
an
angle
from
a
broad
upper
face
the
skin
was
dark
covered
largely
with
a
soft
and
silky
down
out
of
which
hooked
a
curved
and
shining
nose
set
between
two
large
round
eyes
on
top
of
that
astonishing
head
the
down
rose
to
a
peak
not
unlike
a
cockatoo
crest
yet
there
was
no
mistaking
the
intelligence
in
those
eyes
nor
the
other
amazement
at
sight
of
ross
they
might
have
been
staring
at
each
other
through
a
window
squawk
squeek
squawk
the
creature
in
the
mirror
on
the
vision
plate
or
outside
the
window
moved
its
absurdly
small
mouth
in
time
to
those
sounds
ross
swallowed
again
and
automatically
made
answer
hello
his
voice
was
a
weak
whistle
and
perhaps
it
did
not
reach
the
one
for
he
continued
his
questions
if
questions
they
were
meanwhile
ross
over
his
first
stupefaction
tried
to
see
something
of
the
creature
background
though
the
objects
were
slightly
out
of
focus
he
was
sure
he
recognized
fittings
similar
to
those
about
him
he
must
be
in
communication
with
another
ship
of
the
same
type
and
one
which
was
not
deserted
had
turned
his
head
away
to
squawk
rapidly
over
his
shoulder
a
shoulder
which
was
crossed
by
a
belt
or
sash
with
an
elaborate
pattern
then
he
got
up
from
his
seat
and
stood
aside
to
make
room
for
the
one
he
had
summoned
if
had
been
a
startling
surprise
ross
was
now
to
have
another
the
man
who
now
faced
him
on
the
screen
was
totally
different
his
skin
registered
as
pale
and
his
face
was
far
more
human
in
shape
though
it
was
hairless
as
was
the
smooth
dome
of
his
skull
when
one
became
accustomed
to
that
egg
slickness
the
stranger
was
not
and
he
was
wearing
a
suit
which
matched
the
one
ross
had
taken
from
the
lifeboat
this
one
did
not
attempt
to
say
anything
instead
he
stared
at
ross
long
and
measuringly
his
eyes
growing
colder
and
less
friendly
with
every
second
of
that
examination
ross
had
resented
kelgarries
back
at
the
project
but
the
major
could
not
match
baldy
for
the
sheer
weight
of
unpleasant
warning
he
could
pack
into
a
look
ross
might
have
been
startled
by
but
now
his
stubborn
streak
arose
to
meet
this
implied
challenge
he
found
himself
breathing
hard
and
glaring
back
with
an
intensity
which
he
hoped
would
get
across
and
prove
to
baldy
that
he
would
not
have
everything
his
own
way
if
he
proposed
to
tangle
with
ross
his
preoccupation
with
the
stranger
on
the
screen
betrayed
ross
into
the
hands
of
those
from
below
he
heard
their
attack
on
the
barricade
too
late
by
the
time
he
turned
around
the
cork
of
seats
was
heaved
up
and
a
gun
was
pointing
at
his
middle
his
hands
went
up
in
small
reluctant
jerks
as
that
threat
held
him
where
he
was
two
of
the
reds
climbed
into
the
control
chamber
ross
recognized
the
leader
as
ashe
double
the
man
he
had
followed
across
time
he
blinked
for
just
an
instant
as
he
faced
ross
and
then
shouted
an
order
at
his
companion
the
other
spun
murdock
around
bringing
his
hands
down
behind
him
to
clamp
his
wrists
together
once
again
ross
fronted
the
screen
and
saw
baldy
watching
the
whole
scene
with
an
expression
suggesting
that
he
had
been
shocked
out
of
his
complacent
superiority
ah
ross
captors
were
staring
at
the
screen
and
the
unearthly
man
there
then
one
flung
himself
at
the
control
panel
and
his
hands
whipped
back
and
forth
restoring
to
utter
silence
both
screen
and
room
what
are
you
the
man
who
might
have
been
ashe
spoke
slowly
in
the
beaker
tongue
drilling
ross
with
his
stare
as
if
by
the
force
of
his
will
alone
he
could
pull
the
truth
out
of
his
prisoner
what
do
you
think
i
am
ross
countered
he
was
wearing
the
uniform
of
baldy
and
he
had
clearly
established
contact
with
the
time
owners
of
this
ship
let
that
worry
the
red
but
they
did
not
try
to
answer
him
at
a
signal
he
was
led
to
the
stair
to
descend
that
ladder
with
his
hands
behind
him
was
almost
impossible
and
they
had
to
pause
at
the
next
level
to
unclasp
the
handcuffs
and
let
him
go
free
keeping
a
gun
on
him
carefully
they
hurried
along
trying
to
push
the
pace
while
ross
delayed
all
he
could
he
realized
that
in
his
recognition
of
the
power
of
the
gun
back
in
the
control
chamber
his
surrender
to
its
threat
he
had
betrayed
his
real
origin
so
he
must
continue
to
confuse
the
trail
to
the
project
in
every
possible
way
left
to
him
he
was
sure
that
this
time
they
would
not
leave
him
in
the
first
convenient
crevice
he
knew
he
was
right
when
they
covered
him
with
a
fur
parka
at
the
entrance
to
the
ship
once
more
manacling
his
hands
and
dropping
a
noose
leash
on
him
so
they
were
taking
him
back
to
their
post
here
well
in
the
post
was
the
time
transporter
which
could
return
him
to
his
own
kind
it
would
be
it
must
be
possible
to
get
to
that
he
gave
his
captors
no
more
trouble
but
trudged
outwardly
dispirited
along
the
rutted
way
through
the
snow
up
the
slope
and
out
of
the
valley
he
did
manage
to
catch
a
good
look
at
the
more
than
half
of
it
he
judged
was
below
the
surface
of
the
ground
to
be
so
buried
it
must
either
have
lain
there
a
long
time
or
if
it
were
an
air
vessel
crashed
hard
enough
to
dig
itself
that
partial
grave
yet
ross
had
established
contact
with
another
ship
like
it
and
neither
of
the
creatures
he
had
seen
were
human
at
least
not
human
in
any
way
he
knew
ross
chewed
on
that
as
he
walked
he
believed
that
those
with
him
were
looting
the
ship
of
its
cargo
and
by
its
size
that
cargo
must
be
a
large
one
but
cargo
from
where
made
by
what
hands
what
of
hands
enroute
to
what
port
and
how
had
the
reds
located
the
ship
in
the
first
place
there
were
plenty
of
questions
and
very
few
answers
ross
clung
to
the
hope
that
somehow
he
had
endangered
the
reds
job
here
by
activating
the
communication
system
of
the
derelict
and
calling
the
attention
of
its
probable
owners
to
its
fate
he
also
believed
that
the
owners
might
take
steps
to
regain
their
property
baldy
had
impressed
him
deeply
during
those
few
moments
of
silent
appraisal
and
he
knew
he
would
not
like
to
be
on
the
receiving
end
of
any
retaliation
from
the
other
well
now
he
had
only
one
chance
to
keep
the
reds
guessing
as
long
as
he
could
and
hope
for
some
turn
of
fate
which
would
allow
him
to
try
for
the
time
transport
how
the
plate
operated
he
did
not
know
but
he
had
been
transferred
here
from
the
beaker
age
and
if
he
could
return
to
that
time
escape
might
be
possible
he
had
only
to
reach
the
river
and
follow
it
down
to
the
sea
where
the
sub
was
to
make
rendezvous
at
intervals
the
odds
were
overwhelmingly
against
him
and
ross
knew
it
but
there
was
no
reason
he
decided
to
lie
down
and
roll
over
dead
to
please
the
reds
as
they
approached
the
post
ross
realized
how
much
skill
had
gone
into
its
construction
it
looked
as
if
they
were
merely
coming
up
to
the
outer
edge
of
a
glacier
tongue
had
it
not
been
for
the
track
in
the
snow
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
suspect
that
the
ice
covered
anything
but
a
thick
core
of
its
own
substance
ross
was
shoved
through
the
tunnel
to
the
building
beyond
he
was
hurried
through
the
chain
of
rooms
to
a
door
and
thrust
through
his
hands
still
fastened
it
was
dark
in
the
cubby
and
colder
than
it
had
been
outside
ross
stood
still
waiting
for
his
eyes
to
adjust
to
the
gloom
it
was
several
moments
after
the
door
had
slammed
shut
that
he
caught
a
faint
thud
a
dull
and
hollow
sound
who
is
here
he
used
the
beaker
speech
determining
to
keep
to
the
rags
of
his
cover
which
probably
was
a
cover
no
longer
there
was
no
reply
but
after
a
pause
that
distant
beat
began
again
ross
stepped
cautiously
forward
and
by
the
simple
method
of
running
fullface
into
the
walls
discovered
that
he
was
in
a
bare
cell
he
also
discovered
that
the
noise
lay
behind
the
wall
and
he
stood
with
his
ear
flat
against
it
listening
the
sound
did
not
have
the
regular
rhythm
of
a
machine
in
use
there
were
odd
pauses
between
some
blows
others
came
in
a
quick
rain
it
was
as
if
someone
were
digging
were
the
reds
engaged
in
enlarging
their
icebound
headquarters
having
listened
for
a
considerable
time
ross
doubted
that
for
the
sound
was
too
irregular
it
seemed
almost
as
if
the
longer
pauses
were
used
to
check
up
on
the
result
of
labor
was
it
the
extent
of
the
excavation
or
the
continued
preservation
of
secrecy
ross
slipped
down
along
the
wall
his
shoulders
still
resting
against
it
and
rested
with
his
head
twisted
so
he
could
hear
the
tapping
meanwhile
he
flexed
his
wrists
inside
the
hoops
which
confined
them
and
folding
his
hands
as
small
as
possible
tried
to
slip
them
through
the
rings
the
only
result
was
that
he
chafed
his
skin
raw
to
no
advantage
they
had
not
taken
off
his
parka
and
in
spite
of
the
chill
about
him
he
was
too
warm
only
that
part
of
his
body
covered
by
the
suit
he
had
taken
from
the
ship
was
comfortable
he
could
almost
believe
that
it
possessed
some
conditioning
device
with
no
hope
of
relief
ross
rubbed
his
hands
back
and
forth
against
the
wall
scraping
the
hoops
on
his
wrists
the
distant
pounding
had
ceased
and
this
time
the
pause
lengthened
into
so
long
a
period
that
ross
fell
asleep
his
head
falling
forward
on
his
chest
his
raw
wrists
still
pushed
against
the
surface
behind
him
he
was
hungry
when
he
awoke
and
with
that
hunger
his
rebellion
sparked
into
flame
awkwardly
he
got
to
his
feet
and
lurched
along
to
the
door
through
which
he
had
been
thrown
where
he
proceeded
to
kick
at
the
barrier
the
cushiony
stuff
forming
the
soles
of
his
tights
muffled
most
of
the
force
of
those
blows
but
some
noise
was
heard
outside
for
the
door
opened
and
ross
faced
one
of
the
guards
food
i
want
to
eat
he
put
into
the
beaker
language
all
the
resentment
boiling
in
him
the
fellow
ignoring
him
reached
in
a
long
arm
and
nearly
tossing
the
prisoner
off
balance
dragged
him
out
of
the
cell
ross
was
marched
into
another
room
to
face
what
appeared
to
be
a
tribunal
two
of
the
men
there
he
knew
ashe
double
and
the
quiet
man
who
had
questioned
him
back
in
the
other
time
station
the
third
clearly
one
of
greater
authority
regarded
ross
bleakly
who
are
you
the
quiet
man
asked
rossa
son
of
gurdi
and
i
would
eat
before
i
make
talk
with
you
i
have
not
done
any
wrong
that
you
should
treat
me
as
a
barbarian
who
has
stolen
salt
from
the
trading
post
you
are
an
agent
the
leader
corrected
him
dispassionately
of
whom
you
will
tell
us
in
due
time
but
first
you
shall
speak
of
the
ship
of
what
you
found
there
and
why
you
meddled
with
the
controls
wait
a
moment
before
you
refuse
my
young
friend
he
raised
his
hand
from
his
lap
and
once
again
ross
faced
an
automatic
ah
i
see
that
you
know
what
i
hold
odd
knowledge
for
an
innocent
bronze
age
trader
and
please
have
no
doubts
about
my
hesitation
to
use
this
i
shall
not
kill
you
naturally
the
man
continued
but
there
are
certain
wounds
which
supply
a
maximum
of
pain
and
little
serious
damage
remove
his
parka
kirschov
once
more
ross
was
unmanacled
the
fur
stripped
from
him
his
questioner
carefully
studied
the
suit
he
wore
under
it
now
you
will
tell
us
exactly
what
we
wish
to
hear
there
was
a
confidence
in
that
statement
which
chilled
ross
major
kelgarries
had
displayed
its
like
ashe
had
it
in
another
degree
and
certainly
it
had
been
present
in
baldy
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
speaker
meant
exactly
what
he
said
he
had
at
his
command
methods
which
would
wring
from
his
captive
the
full
sum
of
what
he
wanted
and
there
would
be
no
consideration
for
that
captive
during
the
process
his
implied
threat
struck
as
cold
as
the
glacial
air
and
ross
tried
to
meet
it
with
an
outward
show
of
uncracked
defenses
he
decided
to
pick
and
choose
from
his
information
feeding
them
scraps
to
stave
off
the
inevitable
hope
dies
very
hard
and
ross
having
been
pushed
into
corners
long
before
his
work
at
the
project
had
had
considerable
training
in
verbal
fencing
with
hostile
authority
he
would
volunteer
nothing
let
it
be
pulled
from
him
reluctant
word
by
word
he
would
spin
it
out
as
long
as
he
could
and
hope
that
time
might
fight
for
him
you
are
an
agent
ross
accepted
this
statement
as
one
he
would
neither
affirm
nor
deny
you
came
to
spy
under
the
cover
of
a
barbarian
trader
smoothly
without
pause
the
man
changed
language
in
slipping
from
the
beaker
speech
into
english
but
long
experience
in
meeting
the
dangerous
with
an
expression
of
complete
lack
of
comprehension
was
ross
weapon
now
he
stared
somewhat
stupidly
at
his
interrogator
with
that
bewildered
boyish
look
he
had
so
long
cultivated
to
bemuse
enemies
in
his
past
whether
he
could
have
held
out
long
against
the
other
skill
for
ross
possessed
no
illusions
concerning
the
type
of
examiner
he
now
faced
he
was
never
to
know
perhaps
the
drastic
interruption
that
occurred
the
next
moment
saved
for
ross
a
measure
of
there
was
a
distant
boom
hollow
and
thunderous
underneath
and
around
them
the
floor
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
room
moved
as
if
they
had
been
pried
from
their
setting
of
ice
and
were
being
rolled
about
by
the
exploring
thumb
and
forefinger
of
some
impatient
giant
chapter
ross
swayed
against
a
guard
was
fended
off
and
bounced
against
the
wall
as
the
man
shouted
words
ross
could
not
understand
a
determined
roar
from
the
leader
brought
a
semblance
of
order
but
it
was
plain
that
they
had
not
been
expecting
this
ross
was
hustled
out
of
the
room
back
to
his
cell
his
guards
were
opening
the
cell
door
when
a
second
shock
was
felt
and
he
was
thrust
into
safekeeping
with
no
ceremony
he
half
crouched
against
the
questionable
security
of
the
wall
waiting
through
two
more
twisting
earth
waves
both
of
which
were
accompanied
or
preceded
by
dull
sounds
bombing
that
last
wrench
was
really
bad
ross
found
himself
lying
on
the
floor
feeling
tremors
rippling
along
the
earth
his
stomach
knotted
convulsively
with
a
fear
unlike
any
he
had
known
before
it
was
as
if
the
very
security
of
the
world
had
been
jerked
from
under
him
but
that
last
explosion
if
it
was
an
explosion
appeared
to
be
the
end
ross
sat
up
gingerly
after
several
long
moments
during
which
no
more
shocks
moved
the
floor
and
walls
a
line
of
light
marked
the
door
showing
cracks
where
none
had
previously
existed
ross
not
yet
ready
to
try
standing
erect
was
heading
toward
it
on
his
hands
and
knees
when
a
sharp
noise
behind
him
brought
him
to
a
stop
there
was
no
light
to
see
by
but
he
was
certain
that
the
scrape
of
metal
against
metal
sounded
from
the
far
side
of
the
wall
he
crawled
back
and
put
his
ear
to
the
surface
now
he
heard
not
only
that
scraping
but
an
undercurrent
of
clicks
chippings
under
his
exploring
hands
the
surface
remained
as
smooth
as
ever
however
then
suddenly
perhaps
a
foot
from
his
head
there
sounded
a
rip
of
metal
the
wall
was
being
holed
from
the
other
side
ross
caught
a
flicker
of
very
weak
light
and
moving
in
it
was
the
point
of
a
tool
pulling
at
the
smooth
surface
of
the
wall
it
broke
away
with
a
brittle
sound
and
a
hand
holding
a
light
reached
through
the
aperture
ross
wondered
if
he
should
catch
that
wrist
but
the
hope
that
the
digger
might
just
possibly
be
an
ally
kept
him
motionless
after
the
hand
with
the
light
whipped
back
beyond
the
wall
a
wide
section
gave
away
and
a
hunched
figure
crawled
through
followed
by
a
second
in
the
limited
glow
he
saw
the
first
tunneler
clearly
enough
assha
ross
was
unprepared
for
what
followed
his
cry
the
lean
brown
man
moved
with
a
panther
striking
speed
and
ross
was
forced
back
a
hand
like
a
steel
ring
on
his
throat
shut
the
breath
away
from
his
bursting
lungs
the
other
muscular
body
held
him
flat
in
spite
of
his
struggles
the
light
of
the
small
flash
glowed
inches
beyond
his
eyes
as
he
fought
to
fill
his
lungs
then
the
hand
on
his
throat
was
gone
and
he
gasped
a
little
dizzy
murdock
what
are
you
doing
ashe
clipped
voice
was
muffled
by
another
sudden
explosion
this
time
the
earth
tremors
not
only
hurled
them
from
their
feet
but
seemed
to
run
along
the
walls
and
across
the
ceiling
ross
burying
his
face
in
the
crook
of
his
arm
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
fear
that
the
building
was
being
slowly
twisted
into
scrap
when
the
shock
was
over
he
raised
his
head
what
going
on
he
heard
mcneil
ask
attack
that
was
ashe
but
why
and
by
whom
do
ask
me
you
are
a
prisoner
i
suppose
murdock
yes
sir
ross
was
glad
that
his
voice
sounded
normal
enough
he
heard
someone
sigh
and
guessed
it
was
mcneil
another
digging
party
there
was
tired
disgust
in
that
i
do
understand
ross
appealed
to
that
section
of
the
dark
where
ashe
had
been
have
you
been
here
all
the
time
are
you
trying
to
dig
your
way
out
i
do
see
how
you
can
cut
out
of
this
glacier
that
parked
under
glacier
ashe
exclamation
was
as
explosive
as
the
tremors
so
inside
a
glacier
that
explains
it
yes
we
been
here
on
ice
mcneil
commented
and
then
laughed
glacier
ice
right
is
it
we
collaborating
ashe
continued
supplying
our
dear
friends
with
a
lot
of
information
they
already
have
and
some
flights
of
fancy
they
never
dreamed
about
however
they
did
know
we
had
a
few
surprise
packets
of
our
own
strewn
about
it
amazing
what
the
boys
back
at
the
project
can
pack
away
in
a
belt
or
between
layers
of
hide
in
a
boot
so
we
been
engaged
in
some
research
of
our
own
but
i
did
have
any
escape
gadgets
ross
was
struck
by
the
unfairness
of
that
no
ashe
agreed
his
voice
even
and
cold
they
are
not
entrusted
to
men
you
might
slip
up
and
use
them
at
the
wrong
moment
however
you
appear
to
have
done
fairly
well
the
heat
of
ross
rising
anger
was
chilled
by
the
noise
which
cracked
over
their
heads
ground
to
them
through
the
walls
flattened
and
threatened
them
he
had
thought
those
first
shocks
the
end
of
this
ice
burrow
and
the
world
he
knew
that
this
one
was
and
the
silence
that
followed
was
as
threatening
in
its
way
as
the
clamor
had
been
then
there
was
a
shout
a
shriek
the
space
of
light
near
the
cell
door
was
widening
as
that
barrier
broken
from
its
lock
swung
open
slowly
the
fear
of
being
trapped
sent
the
men
in
that
direction
out
ross
was
ready
enough
to
respond
to
that
order
but
they
were
stopped
by
a
crackle
of
sound
that
could
be
only
one
thing
guns
somewhere
in
this
warren
a
fight
was
in
progress
ross
remembering
the
arrogant
face
of
the
bald
ship
officer
wondered
if
this
was
not
an
attack
in
force
the
aliens
against
the
looting
reds
if
so
would
the
ship
people
distinguish
between
those
found
here
he
feared
not
the
room
outside
was
clear
but
not
for
long
as
they
lay
watching
two
men
backed
in
then
whirled
to
stare
at
each
other
a
voice
roared
from
beyond
as
if
ordering
them
back
to
some
post
one
of
them
took
a
step
forward
in
reluctant
obedience
but
the
other
grabbed
his
arm
and
pulled
him
away
they
turned
to
run
and
an
automatic
cracked
the
man
nearest
ross
gave
a
queer
little
cough
and
folded
forward
to
his
knees
sprawling
on
his
face
his
companion
stared
at
him
wildly
for
an
instant
and
then
skidded
into
the
passage
beyond
escaping
by
inches
a
shot
which
clipped
the
door
as
he
lunged
through
it
no
one
followed
for
outside
there
was
a
crescendo
of
noise
shouting
cries
of
pain
an
unidentifiable
hissing
ashe
darted
into
the
room
taking
cover
by
the
body
then
he
came
back
the
fellow
gun
in
his
hand
and
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
summoned
the
other
two
he
motioned
them
on
in
a
direction
away
from
the
sounds
of
battle
i
do
get
all
this
mcneil
commented
as
they
reached
the
next
passage
what
going
on
mutiny
or
have
our
boys
gotten
through
it
must
be
the
ship
people
ross
answered
what
ship
ashe
caught
him
up
swiftly
the
big
one
the
reds
have
been
looting
ship
echoed
mcneil
and
did
you
get
that
rig
in
the
bright
light
it
was
easy
to
see
ross
alien
dress
mcneil
fingered
the
elastic
material
wonderingly
from
the
ship
ross
returned
impatiently
but
if
the
ship
people
are
attacking
i
do
think
they
will
notice
any
difference
between
us
and
the
reds
there
was
a
burst
of
sound
for
the
third
time
ross
was
thrown
from
his
feet
this
time
the
burrow
lights
flickered
dimmed
and
went
out
oh
fine
commented
mcneil
bitterly
out
of
the
dark
i
never
did
care
for
blindman
buff
the
transfer
plate
ross
clung
to
his
own
plan
of
escape
if
we
can
reach
that
the
light
which
had
served
ashe
and
mcneil
in
their
tunneling
clicked
on
since
the
earth
shocks
appeared
to
be
over
for
a
while
they
moved
on
with
ashe
in
the
lead
and
mcneil
bringing
up
the
rear
ross
hoped
ashe
knew
the
way
the
sound
of
fighting
had
died
out
so
one
side
or
the
other
must
have
gained
the
victory
they
might
have
only
a
few
moments
left
to
pass
undetected
ross
sense
of
direction
was
fairly
acute
but
he
could
not
have
gone
so
unerringly
to
what
he
sought
as
ashe
did
only
he
did
not
lead
them
to
the
room
with
the
glowing
plate
and
ross
stifled
a
protest
as
they
came
instead
to
a
small
record
room
on
a
table
were
three
spools
of
tape
which
ashe
caught
up
avidly
thrusting
two
in
the
front
of
his
baggy
tunic
passing
the
third
to
mcneil
then
he
sped
about
trying
the
cupboards
on
the
walls
but
all
were
locked
his
hand
falling
from
the
last
latch
ashe
came
back
to
the
door
where
ross
waited
to
the
plate
ross
urged
ashe
surveyed
the
cupboards
once
more
regretfully
if
we
could
have
just
ten
minutes
here
mcneil
snorted
listen
you
may
yearn
to
be
the
filling
in
an
ice
sandwich
but
i
do
another
shock
and
we
be
buried
so
deep
even
a
drill
could
find
us
let
get
out
now
the
kid
is
right
about
that
if
we
still
can
once
more
ashe
took
the
lead
and
they
wove
through
ghostly
rooms
to
what
must
have
been
the
heart
of
the
post
the
transfer
point
to
unvoiced
relief
the
plate
was
glowing
he
had
been
nagged
by
the
fear
that
when
the
lights
blew
out
the
transfer
plate
might
also
have
been
affected
he
jumped
for
the
plate
neither
ashe
nor
mcneil
wasted
time
in
joining
him
there
as
they
clung
together
there
was
a
cry
from
behind
them
underlined
by
a
shot
ross
feeling
ashe
sag
against
him
caught
him
in
his
arms
by
the
reflected
glow
of
the
plate
he
saw
the
red
leader
of
the
post
and
behind
him
his
hairless
face
hanging
oddly
bodiless
in
the
gloom
was
the
alien
were
those
two
now
allies
before
ross
could
be
sure
that
he
had
really
seen
them
the
wracking
of
space
time
caught
him
and
the
rest
of
the
room
faded
away
free
get
a
move
on
ross
glanced
across
ashe
bowed
shoulders
to
mcneil
excited
face
the
other
was
pulling
at
ashe
who
was
only
a
stream
of
blood
from
a
hole
in
his
bare
shoulder
soaked
the
upper
edge
of
his
beaker
tunic
but
as
they
steadied
him
between
them
he
gained
some
measure
of
awareness
and
moved
his
feet
as
they
pulled
him
off
the
plate
well
they
were
free
if
only
for
a
few
seconds
and
there
was
no
reception
committee
waiting
for
them
ross
gave
thanks
silently
for
those
two
small
favors
but
if
they
were
now
returned
to
the
bronze
age
village
they
were
still
in
enemy
territory
with
ashe
wounded
the
odds
against
them
were
so
high
it
was
almost
hopeless
working
hurriedly
with
strips
torn
from
mcneil
kilt
they
managed
to
stop
the
flow
of
blood
from
ashe
wound
although
he
was
still
groggy
he
was
fighting
driven
by
the
fear
which
whipped
them
all
time
was
one
of
their
foremost
enemies
ross
ashe
gun
in
hand
kept
watch
on
the
transfer
plate
ready
to
shoot
at
anything
appearing
there
that
will
have
to
do
ashe
pulled
free
from
mcneil
we
must
move
he
hesitated
and
then
pulling
the
spools
of
tape
from
his
bloodstained
tunic
passed
them
to
mcneil
you
better
carry
these
all
right
the
other
answered
almost
absently
move
the
force
of
that
order
from
ashe
sent
them
into
the
corridor
beyond
the
plate
but
the
plate
remained
clear
and
ross
noted
that
they
must
have
returned
to
the
proper
time
for
the
walls
about
them
were
the
logs
and
stone
of
the
village
he
remembered
someone
coming
through
should
be
soon
they
fled
the
hide
boots
of
the
other
two
making
only
the
faintest
whisper
of
sound
ross
feet
none
at
all
he
could
not
have
found
the
door
to
the
outer
world
but
again
ashe
guided
them
and
only
once
did
they
have
to
seek
cover
at
last
they
faced
a
barred
door
ashe
leaned
against
the
wall
mcneil
supporting
him
as
ross
pulled
free
the
locking
beam
they
let
themselves
out
into
the
night
which
way
mcneil
asked
to
ross
surprise
ashe
did
not
turn
to
the
gate
in
the
outer
stockade
instead
he
gestured
at
the
mountain
wall
in
the
opposite
direction
they
expect
us
to
try
for
the
valley
pass
so
we
had
better
go
up
the
slope
there
that
has
the
look
of
a
tough
climb
ventured
mcneil
ashe
stirred
when
it
becomes
too
tough
for
me
his
voice
was
dry
i
shall
say
so
never
fear
he
started
out
with
some
of
his
old
ease
of
movement
but
his
companions
closed
in
on
either
side
ready
to
offer
aid
ross
often
wondered
later
if
they
could
have
won
free
of
the
village
on
their
own
efforts
that
night
he
was
sure
their
resolution
would
have
been
equal
to
the
attempt
but
their
escape
would
have
depended
upon
a
fabulous
run
of
luck
such
as
men
seldom
encounter
as
it
was
they
had
just
reached
a
pool
of
shadow
beside
a
small
hut
some
two
buildings
away
from
the
one
they
had
fled
when
the
fireworks
began
as
if
on
signal
the
three
fugitives
threw
themselves
flat
from
the
roof
of
the
building
at
the
center
of
the
village
a
pencil
of
light
pointed
straight
up
into
the
sky
and
around
that
spear
of
radiance
the
roof
sprouted
tongues
of
more
natural
flames
figures
shot
from
doors
as
the
fire
lapped
down
the
peak
of
the
roof
now
in
spite
of
the
rising
clamor
ashe
voice
carried
to
his
two
companions
the
three
sprinted
for
the
palisade
mingling
with
bewildered
men
who
ran
out
of
the
other
cabins
the
waves
of
fire
washed
on
providing
light
too
much
light
ashe
and
mcneil
could
pass
as
part
of
the
crowd
but
ross
unusual
clothing
might
be
easily
marked
others
were
running
for
the
wall
ross
and
mcneil
boosted
ashe
to
the
top
saw
him
over
in
safety
mcneil
followed
ross
was
just
reaching
to
draw
himself
up
when
he
was
enveloped
in
a
beam
of
light
a
high
screeching
call
unlike
any
shout
he
had
heard
split
the
clamor
frantically
ross
tried
for
a
hold
knowing
that
he
was
presenting
a
perfect
target
for
those
behind
he
gained
the
top
of
the
stockade
looked
down
into
a
black
block
of
shadow
not
knowing
whether
ashe
and
mcneil
were
waiting
for
him
or
had
gone
ahead
hearing
that
strange
cry
again
ross
leaped
blindly
out
into
the
darkness
he
landed
badly
hitting
hard
enough
to
bruise
but
thanks
to
the
skill
he
had
learned
for
parachuting
he
broke
no
bones
he
got
to
his
feet
and
blundered
on
in
the
general
direction
of
the
mountain
ashe
had
picked
as
their
goal
there
were
others
coming
over
the
wall
of
the
village
and
moving
through
the
shadows
so
he
dared
not
call
out
for
fear
of
alerting
the
enemy
the
village
had
been
set
in
the
widest
part
of
the
valley
behind
its
stockade
the
open
ground
narrowed
swiftly
like
the
point
of
a
funnel
and
all
fugitives
from
the
settlement
had
to
pass
through
that
channel
to
escape
ross
worst
fear
was
that
he
had
lost
contact
with
ashe
and
mcneil
and
that
he
would
never
be
able
to
pick
up
their
trail
in
the
wilderness
ahead
thankful
for
the
dark
suit
he
wore
which
was
protective
covering
in
the
night
he
twice
ducked
into
the
brush
to
allow
parties
of
refugees
to
pass
him
hearing
them
speak
the
guttural
clicking
speech
he
had
learned
from
ulffa
people
ross
deduced
that
they
were
innocent
of
the
village
real
purpose
these
people
were
convinced
they
had
been
attacked
by
night
demons
perhaps
there
had
only
been
a
handful
of
reds
in
that
hidden
retreat
ross
pulled
himself
up
a
hard
climb
and
pausing
to
catch
his
breath
looked
back
he
was
not
overly
surprised
to
see
figures
moving
leisurely
about
the
village
examining
the
cabins
perhaps
in
search
of
the
inhabitants
each
of
those
searchers
was
clad
in
a
suit
that
matched
his
own
and
their
bulbous
hairless
heads
gleamed
white
in
the
firelight
ross
was
astonished
to
see
that
they
passed
straight
through
walls
of
flame
apparently
unconcerned
and
unsinged
by
the
heat
the
human
beings
trapped
in
the
town
wailed
and
ran
or
lay
and
beat
their
heads
and
hands
on
the
ground
supine
before
the
invaders
each
captive
was
dragged
back
to
a
knot
of
aliens
near
the
main
building
some
were
hurled
out
again
into
the
dark
unharmed
a
few
others
were
retained
a
sorting
of
prisoners
was
plainly
in
progress
there
was
no
question
that
the
ship
people
had
followed
through
into
this
time
and
that
they
had
their
own
arrangements
for
the
reds
ross
had
no
desire
to
learn
the
particulars
he
started
climbing
again
finding
the
pass
at
last
beyond
the
ground
fell
away
again
and
ross
went
forward
into
the
full
darkness
of
the
night
with
a
vast
surge
of
thankfulness
finally
he
stopped
simply
because
he
was
too
weary
too
hungry
to
keep
on
his
feet
without
stumbling
and
a
fall
in
the
dark
on
these
heights
could
be
costly
ross
discovered
a
small
hollow
behind
a
stunted
tree
and
crept
into
it
as
best
he
could
his
heart
laboring
against
his
ribs
a
hot
stab
of
pain
cutting
into
his
side
with
every
breath
he
drew
he
awoke
all
at
once
with
the
snap
of
a
fighting
man
who
is
alert
to
ever
present
danger
a
hand
lay
warm
and
hard
over
his
mouth
and
above
it
his
eyes
met
mcneil
when
he
saw
that
ross
was
awake
mcneil
withdraw
his
hand
the
morning
sunlight
was
warm
about
them
moving
clumsily
because
of
his
stiff
bruised
body
ross
crawled
out
of
the
hollow
he
looked
around
but
mcneil
stood
there
alone
ashe
ross
questioned
him
mcneil
showing
a
haggard
face
covered
with
several
days
growth
of
beard
nodded
his
head
toward
the
slope
fumbling
inside
his
kilt
he
brought
out
something
clenched
in
his
fist
and
offered
it
to
ross
the
latter
held
out
his
palm
and
mcneil
covered
it
with
a
handful
of
grain
just
to
look
at
the
stuff
made
ross
long
for
a
drink
but
he
mouthed
it
and
chewed
getting
up
to
follow
mcneil
down
into
the
lower
slopes
it
not
good
mcneil
spoke
jerkily
using
beaker
speech
ashe
is
out
of
his
head
some
of
the
time
that
hole
in
his
shoulder
is
worse
than
we
thought
it
was
and
there
always
the
threat
of
infection
this
whole
wood
is
full
of
people
flushed
out
of
that
blasted
village
most
of
them
all
i
seen
are
natives
but
they
have
it
firmly
planted
in
their
minds
now
that
there
are
devils
after
them
if
they
see
you
wearing
that
suit
i
know
and
i
strip
if
i
could
ross
agreed
but
i
have
to
get
other
clothing
first
i
ca
run
bare
in
this
cold
that
might
be
safer
mcneil
growled
i
do
know
just
what
happened
back
there
but
it
certainly
must
have
been
plenty
ross
swallowed
a
very
dry
mouthful
of
grain
and
then
stooped
to
scoop
up
some
leftover
snow
in
the
shadow
of
a
tree
root
it
was
not
as
refreshing
as
a
real
drink
but
it
helped
you
said
ashe
is
out
of
his
head
what
do
we
do
for
him
and
what
are
your
plans
we
have
to
reach
the
river
somehow
it
drains
to
the
sea
and
at
its
mouth
we
are
supposed
to
make
contact
with
the
sub
the
proposal
sounded
impossible
to
ross
but
so
many
impossible
things
had
happened
lately
he
was
willing
to
go
along
with
the
idea
as
long
as
he
could
gathering
up
more
snow
he
stuffed
it
into
his
mouth
before
he
followed
the
already
disappearing
mcneil
chapter
that
my
half
of
it
the
rest
of
it
you
know
ross
held
his
hands
close
to
the
small
fire
sheltered
in
the
pit
he
had
helped
dig
and
flexed
his
fingers
in
the
warmth
from
across
the
handful
of
flames
ashe
eyes
too
bright
in
a
face
watched
him
demandingly
the
fugitives
had
taken
cover
in
an
angle
where
the
massed
remains
of
an
old
avalanche
provided
a
mcneil
was
off
scouting
in
the
gray
drizzle
of
the
day
and
their
escape
from
the
village
was
now
some
hours
behind
them
so
the
crackpots
were
right
after
all
they
only
had
their
times
mixed
ashe
shifted
on
the
bed
of
brush
and
leaves
they
had
raked
together
for
his
comfort
i
do
understand
flying
saucers
ashe
returned
with
an
odd
little
laugh
it
was
a
wild
possibility
but
it
was
on
the
books
from
the
start
this
certainly
will
make
kelgarries
turn
red
flying
saucers
ashe
must
be
out
of
his
head
from
the
fever
ross
supposed
he
wondered
what
he
should
do
if
ashe
tried
to
get
up
and
walk
away
he
could
not
tackle
a
man
with
a
bad
hole
in
his
shoulder
nor
was
he
certain
he
could
wrestle
ashe
down
in
a
real
fight
that
was
never
built
on
this
world
use
your
head
murdock
think
about
your
friend
and
the
baldy
with
him
did
either
look
like
normal
terrans
to
you
but
a
spaceship
it
was
something
that
had
so
long
been
laughed
to
scorn
when
men
had
failed
to
break
into
space
after
the
initial
excitement
of
the
satellite
launchings
space
flight
had
become
a
matter
for
jeers
on
the
other
hand
there
was
the
evidence
collected
by
his
own
eyes
and
ears
his
own
experience
the
services
of
the
lifeboat
had
been
techniques
outside
of
his
experience
this
was
insinuated
once
ashe
was
lying
flat
now
gazing
speculatively
up
at
the
projection
of
logs
and
earth
which
made
them
a
partial
roof
along
with
a
lot
of
other
bright
ideas
by
a
gentleman
named
charles
fort
who
took
a
lot
of
pleasure
in
pricking
what
he
considered
to
be
vastly
scientific
pomposity
he
gathered
together
four
book
loads
of
reported
incidents
of
unexplainable
happenings
which
he
dared
the
scientists
of
his
day
to
explain
and
one
of
his
bright
suggestions
was
that
such
phenomena
as
the
vast
artificial
earthworks
found
in
ohio
and
indiana
were
originally
thrown
up
by
space
castaways
to
serve
as
s
o
s
signals
an
intriguing
idea
and
now
perhaps
we
may
prove
it
true
but
if
such
spaceships
were
wrecked
on
this
world
i
still
do
see
why
we
did
find
traces
of
them
in
our
own
time
because
that
wreck
you
explored
was
bedded
in
a
glacial
era
do
you
have
any
idea
how
long
ago
that
was
counting
from
our
own
time
there
were
at
least
three
glacial
periods
and
we
do
know
in
which
one
the
reds
went
visiting
that
age
began
about
a
million
years
before
we
were
born
and
the
last
of
the
ice
ebbed
out
of
new
york
state
some
thousand
years
ago
boy
that
was
the
early
stone
age
reckoning
it
by
the
scale
of
human
development
with
an
extremely
thin
population
of
the
first
real
types
of
man
clinging
to
a
few
warmer
fringes
of
wilderness
climatic
changes
geographical
changes
all
altered
the
face
of
our
continents
there
was
a
sea
in
kansas
england
was
part
of
europe
so
even
though
as
many
as
fifty
such
ships
were
lost
here
they
could
all
have
been
ground
to
bits
by
the
ice
flow
buried
miles
deep
in
quakes
or
rusted
away
generations
before
the
first
really
intelligent
man
arrived
to
wonder
at
them
certainly
there
could
be
too
many
such
wrecks
to
be
found
what
do
you
think
this
planet
was
a
flypaper
to
attract
them
but
if
ships
crashed
here
once
why
did
they
later
when
men
were
better
able
to
understand
them
ross
countered
for
several
reasons
all
of
them
possible
and
able
to
be
fitted
into
the
fabric
of
history
as
we
know
it
on
this
world
civilizations
rise
exist
and
fall
each
taking
with
it
into
the
limbo
of
forgotten
things
some
of
the
discoveries
which
made
it
great
how
did
the
indian
civilizations
of
the
new
world
learn
to
harden
gold
into
a
useable
point
for
a
cutting
weapon
what
was
the
secret
of
building
possessed
by
the
ancient
egyptians
today
you
will
find
plenty
of
men
to
argue
these
problems
and
half
a
hundred
others
the
egyptians
once
had
a
trade
route
to
india
bronze
age
traders
opened
up
roads
down
into
africa
the
romans
knew
china
then
came
an
end
to
each
of
these
empires
and
those
trade
routes
were
forgotten
to
our
european
ancestors
of
the
middle
ages
china
was
almost
a
legend
and
the
fact
that
the
egyptians
had
successfully
sailed
around
the
cape
of
good
hope
was
unknown
suppose
our
space
voyagers
represented
some
confederacy
or
empire
which
lived
rose
to
its
highest
point
and
fell
again
into
barbarism
all
before
the
first
of
our
species
painted
pictures
on
a
cave
wall
or
take
it
that
this
world
was
an
unlucky
reef
on
which
too
many
ships
and
cargoes
were
lost
so
that
our
whole
solar
system
was
posted
and
skippers
of
star
ships
thereafter
avoided
it
or
they
might
even
have
had
some
rule
that
when
a
planet
developed
a
primitive
race
of
its
own
it
was
to
be
left
strictly
alone
until
it
discovered
space
flight
for
itself
yes
every
one
of
ashe
suppositions
made
good
sense
and
ross
was
able
to
believe
them
it
was
easier
to
think
that
both
and
baldy
were
inhabitants
of
another
world
than
to
think
their
kind
existed
on
this
planet
before
his
own
species
was
born
but
how
did
the
reds
locate
that
ship
unless
that
information
is
on
the
tapes
we
were
able
to
bring
along
we
shall
probably
never
know
ashe
said
drowsily
i
might
make
one
guess
the
reds
have
been
making
an
effort
for
the
past
hundred
years
to
open
up
siberia
in
some
sections
of
that
huge
country
there
have
been
great
climatic
changes
almost
overnight
in
the
far
past
mammoths
have
been
discovered
frozen
in
the
ice
with
tropical
plants
in
their
stomach
it
as
if
the
beasts
were
given
some
treatment
instantaneously
if
in
their
excavations
the
reds
came
across
the
remains
of
a
spaceship
remains
well
enough
preserved
for
them
to
realize
what
they
had
discovered
they
might
start
questing
back
in
time
to
find
a
better
one
intact
at
an
earlier
date
that
theory
fits
everything
we
know
now
but
why
would
the
aliens
attack
the
reds
now
no
ship
officers
ever
thought
gently
of
pirates
ashe
eyes
closed
there
were
questions
a
flood
of
them
that
ross
wanted
to
ask
he
smoothed
the
fabric
on
his
arm
that
stuff
which
clung
so
tightly
to
his
skin
yet
kept
him
warm
without
any
need
for
more
covering
if
ashe
were
right
on
what
world
what
kind
of
world
had
that
material
been
woven
and
how
far
had
it
been
brought
that
he
could
wear
it
now
suddenly
mcneil
slid
into
their
shelter
and
dropped
two
hares
at
the
edge
of
the
fire
how
goes
it
he
said
as
ross
began
to
clean
them
reasonably
well
ashe
his
eyes
still
closed
replied
to
that
before
ross
could
how
far
are
we
from
the
river
and
do
we
have
company
about
five
miles
if
we
had
wings
mcneil
answered
in
a
dry
tone
and
we
have
company
all
right
lots
of
it
that
brought
ashe
up
leaning
forward
on
his
good
elbow
what
kind
not
from
the
village
mcneil
frowned
at
the
fire
which
he
fed
with
economic
handfuls
of
sticks
something
happening
on
this
side
of
the
mountains
it
looks
as
if
there
a
mass
migration
in
progress
i
counted
five
family
clans
on
their
way
west
all
in
just
this
one
morning
the
village
refugees
stories
about
devils
might
send
them
packing
ashe
mused
maybe
but
mcneil
did
not
sound
convinced
the
sooner
we
head
downstream
the
better
and
i
hope
the
boys
will
have
that
sub
waiting
where
they
promised
we
do
possess
one
thing
in
our
favor
the
spring
floods
are
subsiding
and
the
high
water
should
have
plenty
of
raft
material
ashe
lay
back
again
we
make
those
five
miles
tomorrow
mcneil
stirred
uneasily
and
ross
having
cleaned
and
spitted
the
hares
swung
them
over
the
flames
to
broil
five
miles
in
this
country
the
younger
man
observed
is
a
pretty
good
day
march
he
did
not
add
as
he
wanted
to
for
a
well
man
i
will
make
it
ashe
promised
and
both
listeners
knew
that
as
long
as
his
body
would
obey
him
he
meant
to
keep
that
promise
they
also
knew
the
futility
of
argument
ashe
proved
to
be
a
prophet
to
be
honored
on
two
counts
they
did
make
the
trek
to
the
river
the
next
day
and
there
was
a
wealth
of
raft
material
marking
the
level
of
the
spring
flood
the
migrations
mcneil
had
reported
were
still
in
progress
and
the
three
men
hid
twice
to
watch
the
passing
of
small
family
clans
once
a
respectably
sized
tribe
including
wounded
men
marched
across
their
route
seeking
a
ford
at
the
river
they
been
badly
mauled
mcneil
whispered
as
they
watched
the
people
huddled
along
the
water
edge
while
scouts
cast
upstream
and
down
searching
for
a
ford
when
they
returned
with
the
news
that
there
was
no
ford
to
be
found
the
tribesmen
then
sullenly
went
to
work
with
flint
axes
and
knives
to
make
rafts
pressure
they
are
on
the
run
ashe
rested
his
chin
on
his
good
forearm
and
studied
the
busy
scene
these
are
not
from
the
village
notice
the
dress
and
the
red
paint
on
their
faces
they
not
like
ulffa
kin
either
i
would
say
they
were
local
at
all
reminds
me
of
something
i
saw
once
animals
running
before
a
forest
fire
they
ca
all
be
looking
for
new
hunting
territory
mcneil
returned
reds
sweeping
them
out
ross
suggested
or
could
the
ship
people
ashe
started
to
shake
his
head
and
then
winced
i
wonder
the
crease
between
his
level
brows
deepened
the
ax
people
his
voice
was
still
a
whisper
but
it
carried
a
note
of
triumph
as
if
he
had
fitted
some
stubborn
jigsaw
piece
into
its
proper
place
ax
people
invasion
of
another
people
from
the
east
they
turned
up
in
prehistory
about
this
period
remember
webb
spoke
of
them
they
used
axes
for
weapons
and
tamed
horses
tartars
mcneil
was
puzzled
this
far
west
not
tartars
no
you
need
expect
those
to
come
boiling
out
of
middle
asia
for
some
thousands
of
years
yet
we
do
know
too
much
about
the
ax
people
save
that
they
moved
west
from
the
interior
plains
eventually
they
crossed
to
britain
perhaps
they
were
the
ancestors
of
the
celts
who
loved
horses
too
but
in
their
time
they
were
a
tidal
wave
the
sooner
we
head
downstream
the
better
mcneil
stirred
restlessly
but
they
knew
that
they
must
keep
to
cover
until
the
tribesmen
below
were
gone
so
they
lay
in
hiding
another
night
witnessing
on
the
next
morning
the
arrival
of
a
smaller
party
of
the
men
again
with
wounded
among
them
at
the
coming
of
this
rear
guard
the
activity
on
the
river
bank
rose
close
to
frenzy
the
three
men
out
of
time
were
doubly
uneasy
it
was
not
for
them
to
merely
cross
the
river
they
had
to
build
a
raft
which
would
be
enough
to
take
them
downstream
to
the
sea
if
they
were
lucky
and
to
build
such
a
sturdy
raft
would
take
time
time
they
did
not
have
now
in
fact
mcneil
waited
only
until
the
last
tribal
raft
was
out
of
bow
shot
before
he
plunged
down
to
the
shore
ross
at
his
heels
since
they
lacked
even
the
stone
tools
of
the
tribesmen
they
were
at
a
disadvantage
and
ross
found
he
was
hands
and
feet
for
ashe
working
under
the
other
close
direction
before
night
closed
in
they
had
a
good
beginning
and
two
sets
of
blistered
hands
as
well
as
aching
backs
when
it
was
too
dark
to
work
any
longer
ashe
pointed
back
over
the
track
they
had
followed
marking
the
mountain
pass
was
a
light
it
looked
like
fire
and
if
it
was
it
must
be
a
big
one
for
them
to
be
able
to
sight
it
across
this
distance
camp
mcneil
wondered
must
be
ashe
agreed
those
who
built
that
blaze
are
in
such
numbers
that
they
do
have
to
take
precautions
will
they
be
here
by
tomorrow
their
scouts
might
but
this
is
early
spring
and
forage
ca
have
been
too
good
on
the
march
if
i
were
the
chief
of
that
tribe
i
turn
aside
into
the
meadow
land
we
skirted
yesterday
and
let
the
herds
graze
for
a
day
maybe
more
on
the
other
hand
if
they
need
water
they
will
come
straight
ahead
mcneil
finished
grimly
and
we
be
here
when
they
arrive
ross
stretched
grimacing
at
the
twinge
of
pain
in
his
shoulders
his
hands
smarted
and
throbbed
and
this
was
just
the
beginning
of
their
task
if
ashe
had
been
fit
they
might
have
trusted
to
logs
for
support
and
swum
downstream
to
hunt
a
safer
place
for
their
shipbuilding
project
but
he
knew
that
ashe
could
not
stand
such
an
effort
ross
slept
that
night
mainly
because
his
body
was
too
exhausted
to
let
him
lie
awake
and
worry
roused
in
the
earliest
dawn
by
mcneil
they
both
crawled
down
to
the
water
edge
and
struggled
to
bind
stubbornly
resisting
saplings
together
with
cords
twisted
from
bark
they
reinforced
them
at
crucial
points
with
some
strings
torn
from
their
kilts
and
strips
of
rabbit
hide
saved
from
their
kills
of
the
past
few
days
they
worked
with
hunger
gnawing
at
them
having
no
time
now
to
hunt
when
the
sun
was
well
westward
they
had
a
clumsy
craft
which
floated
sluggishly
whether
it
would
answer
to
either
pole
or
improvised
paddle
they
could
not
know
until
they
tried
it
ashe
his
face
flushed
and
his
skin
hot
to
the
touch
crawled
on
board
and
lay
in
the
middle
on
the
thin
heap
of
bedding
they
had
put
there
for
him
he
eagerly
drank
the
water
they
carried
to
him
in
cupped
hands
and
gave
a
little
sigh
of
relief
as
ross
wiped
his
face
with
wet
grass
muttering
something
about
kelgarries
which
neither
of
his
companions
understood
mcneil
shoved
off
and
the
bobbing
craft
spun
around
dizzily
as
the
current
pulled
it
free
from
the
shore
they
made
a
brave
start
but
luck
deserted
them
before
they
had
gotten
out
of
sight
of
the
spot
where
they
embarked
striving
to
keep
them
in
mcneil
poled
furiously
but
there
were
too
many
rocks
and
snagged
trees
projecting
from
the
banks
sharing
that
sweep
of
water
with
them
and
coming
up
fast
was
a
tree
twice
its
mat
of
branches
caught
on
some
snag
holding
it
back
and
ross
breathed
a
little
more
freely
but
it
soon
tore
free
again
and
rolled
on
as
menacing
as
a
battering
ram
get
closer
to
shore
ross
shouted
the
warning
those
great
twisted
roots
seemed
aimed
straight
at
the
raft
and
he
was
sure
if
that
mass
struck
them
fairly
they
would
not
have
a
chance
he
dug
in
with
his
own
pole
but
his
hasty
push
did
not
meet
bottom
the
stake
in
his
hands
plunged
into
some
pothole
in
the
hidden
river
bed
he
heard
mcneil
cry
out
as
he
toppled
into
the
water
gasping
as
the
murky
liquid
flooded
his
mouth
choking
him
half
dazed
by
the
shock
ross
struck
out
instinctively
the
training
at
the
base
had
included
swimming
but
to
fight
water
in
a
pool
under
controlled
conditions
was
far
different
from
fighting
death
in
a
river
of
icy
water
when
one
had
already
swallowed
a
sizable
quantity
of
that
flood
ross
had
a
half
glimpse
of
a
dark
shadow
was
it
the
edge
of
the
raft
he
caught
at
it
desperately
skinning
his
hands
on
rough
bark
dragged
on
by
it
the
tree
he
blinked
his
eyes
to
clear
them
of
water
to
try
to
see
but
he
could
not
pull
his
exhausted
body
high
enough
out
of
the
water
to
see
past
the
screen
of
roots
he
could
only
cling
to
the
small
safety
he
had
won
and
hope
that
he
could
rejoin
the
raft
somewhere
downstream
after
what
seemed
like
a
very
long
time
he
wedged
one
arm
between
two
roots
sure
that
the
support
would
hold
his
head
above
the
surface
the
chill
of
the
stream
struck
at
his
hands
and
head
but
the
protection
of
the
alien
clothing
was
still
effective
and
the
rest
of
his
body
was
not
cold
he
was
simply
too
tired
to
wrest
himself
free
and
trust
again
to
the
haphazard
chance
of
making
shore
through
the
gathering
dusk
suddenly
a
shock
jarred
his
body
and
strained
the
arm
he
had
thrust
among
the
roots
wringing
a
cry
out
of
him
he
swung
around
and
brushed
footing
under
the
water
the
tree
had
caught
on
a
shore
snag
pulling
loose
from
the
roots
he
floundered
on
his
hands
and
knees
falling
afoul
of
a
mass
of
reeds
whose
roots
were
covered
with
mud
like
a
wounded
animal
he
dragged
himself
through
the
ooze
to
higher
land
coming
out
upon
an
open
meadow
flooded
with
moonlight
for
a
while
he
lay
there
his
cold
sore
hands
under
him
plastered
with
mud
and
too
tired
to
move
the
sound
of
a
sharp
barking
aroused
him
an
imperative
summoning
bark
neither
belonging
to
a
wolf
nor
a
hunting
fox
he
listened
to
it
dully
and
then
through
the
ground
upon
which
he
lay
ross
felt
as
well
as
heard
the
pounding
of
hoofs
hoofs
horses
horses
from
over
the
mountains
horses
which
might
mean
danger
his
mind
seemed
as
dull
and
numb
as
his
hands
and
it
took
quite
a
long
time
for
him
to
fully
realize
the
menace
horses
might
bring
getting
up
ross
noticed
a
winged
shape
sweeping
across
the
disk
of
the
moon
like
a
silent
dart
there
was
a
single
despairing
squeak
out
of
the
grass
about
a
hundred
feet
away
and
the
winged
shape
arose
again
with
its
prey
then
the
barking
sound
once
more
eager
excited
barking
ross
crouched
back
on
his
heels
and
saw
a
smoky
brand
of
light
moving
along
the
edge
of
the
meadow
where
the
band
of
trees
began
could
it
be
a
herd
guard
ross
knew
he
had
to
head
back
toward
the
river
but
he
had
to
force
himself
on
the
path
for
he
did
not
know
whether
he
dared
enter
the
stream
again
but
what
would
happen
if
they
hunted
him
with
the
dog
confused
memories
of
how
water
spoiled
scent
spurred
him
on
having
reached
the
rising
bank
he
had
climbed
so
laboriously
before
ross
miscalculated
and
tumbled
back
rolling
down
into
the
mud
of
the
reed
bed
mechanically
he
wiped
the
slime
from
his
face
the
tree
was
still
anchored
there
by
some
freak
the
current
had
rammed
its
rooted
end
up
on
a
sand
spit
above
in
the
meadow
the
barking
sounded
very
close
and
now
it
was
answered
by
a
second
canine
belling
ross
wormed
his
way
back
through
the
reeds
to
the
patch
of
water
between
the
tree
and
the
bank
his
few
poor
efforts
at
escape
were
almost
taken
he
was
too
tired
to
really
care
now
soon
he
saw
a
shape
running
along
the
top
of
the
bank
giving
tongue
it
was
then
joined
by
a
larger
and
even
more
vocal
companion
the
dogs
drew
even
with
ross
who
wondered
dully
if
the
animals
could
sight
him
in
the
shadows
below
or
whether
they
only
scented
his
presence
had
he
been
able
he
would
have
climbed
over
the
log
and
taken
his
chances
in
the
open
water
but
now
he
could
only
lie
where
he
was
the
tangle
of
roots
between
him
and
the
bank
serving
as
a
screen
which
would
be
little
enough
protection
when
men
came
with
torches
ross
was
mistaken
however
for
his
worm
progress
across
the
reed
bed
had
liberally
besmeared
his
dark
clothing
and
masked
the
skin
of
his
face
and
hands
giving
him
better
cover
than
any
he
could
have
wittingly
devised
though
he
felt
naked
and
defenseless
the
men
who
trailed
the
hounds
to
the
river
bank
thrusting
out
the
torch
over
the
edge
to
light
the
sand
spit
saw
nothing
but
the
trunk
of
the
tree
wedged
against
a
mound
of
mud
ross
heard
a
confused
murmur
of
voices
broken
by
the
clamor
of
the
dogs
then
the
torch
was
raised
out
of
line
of
his
dazzled
eyes
he
saw
one
of
the
indistinct
figures
above
cuff
away
a
dog
and
move
off
calling
the
hounds
after
it
reluctantly
still
barking
the
animals
went
ross
with
a
little
sob
subsided
limply
in
the
uncomfortable
net
of
roots
still
undiscovered
chapter
it
was
such
a
small
thing
a
tag
of
ragged
stuff
looped
about
a
length
of
splintered
sapling
ross
climbed
stiffly
over
the
welter
of
drift
caught
on
the
sand
spit
and
pulled
it
loose
recognizing
the
string
even
before
he
touched
it
that
square
knot
was
of
mcneil
tying
and
as
murdock
sat
down
weakly
in
the
sand
and
mud
nervously
fingering
the
twisted
cord
staring
vacantly
at
the
river
his
last
small
hope
died
the
raft
must
have
broken
up
and
neither
ashe
nor
mcneil
could
have
survived
the
ultimate
disaster
ross
murdock
was
alone
marooned
in
a
time
which
was
not
his
own
with
little
promise
of
escape
that
one
thought
blanked
out
his
mind
with
its
own
darkness
what
was
the
use
of
getting
up
again
of
trying
to
find
food
for
his
empty
stomach
or
warmth
and
shelter
he
had
always
prided
himself
on
being
able
to
go
it
alone
had
thought
himself
secure
in
that
calculated
loneliness
now
that
belief
had
been
washed
away
in
the
river
along
with
most
of
the
will
power
which
had
kept
him
going
these
past
days
before
there
had
always
been
some
goal
no
matter
how
remote
now
he
had
nothing
even
if
he
managed
to
reach
the
mouth
of
the
river
he
had
no
idea
of
where
or
how
to
summon
the
sub
from
the
overseas
post
all
three
of
the
time
travelers
might
already
have
been
written
off
the
rolls
since
they
had
not
reported
in
ross
pulled
the
rag
free
from
the
sapling
and
wreathed
it
in
a
tight
bracelet
about
his
grimed
wrist
for
some
unexplainable
reason
worn
and
tired
he
tried
to
think
ahead
there
was
no
chance
of
again
contacting
ulffa
tribe
along
with
all
the
other
woodland
hunters
they
must
have
fled
before
the
advance
of
the
horsemen
no
there
was
no
reason
to
go
back
and
why
make
the
effort
to
advance
the
sun
was
hot
this
was
one
of
those
spring
days
which
foretell
the
ripeness
of
summer
insects
buzzed
in
the
reed
banks
where
a
green
sheen
showed
birds
wheeled
and
circled
in
the
sky
some
flock
disturbed
their
cries
reaching
ross
in
hoarse
calls
of
warning
he
was
still
plastered
with
patches
of
dried
mud
and
slime
the
reek
of
it
thick
in
his
nostrils
now
ross
brushed
at
a
splotch
on
his
knee
picking
loose
flakes
to
expose
the
alien
cloth
of
his
suit
underneath
seemingly
unbefouled
all
at
once
it
became
necessary
to
be
clean
again
at
least
ross
waded
into
the
stream
stooping
to
splash
the
brown
water
over
his
body
and
then
rubbing
away
the
resulting
mud
in
the
sunlight
the
fabric
had
a
brilliant
glow
as
if
it
not
only
drew
the
light
but
reflected
it
wading
farther
out
into
the
water
he
began
to
swim
not
with
any
goal
in
view
but
because
it
was
easier
than
crawling
back
to
land
once
more
using
the
downstream
current
to
supplement
his
skill
he
watched
both
banks
he
could
not
really
hope
to
see
either
the
raft
or
indications
that
its
passengers
had
won
to
shore
but
somewhere
deep
inside
him
he
had
not
yet
accepted
the
probable
the
effort
of
swimming
broke
through
that
fog
of
inertia
which
had
held
him
since
he
had
awakened
that
morning
it
was
with
a
somewhat
healthier
interest
in
life
that
ross
came
ashore
again
on
an
arm
of
what
was
a
bay
or
inlet
angling
back
into
the
land
here
the
banks
of
the
river
were
well
above
his
head
and
believing
that
he
was
well
sheltered
he
stripped
hanging
his
suit
in
the
sunlight
and
letting
the
unusual
heat
of
the
day
soothe
his
body
a
raw
fish
cornered
in
the
shallows
and
scooped
out
furnished
one
of
the
best
meals
he
had
ever
tasted
he
had
reached
for
the
suit
draped
over
a
willow
limb
when
the
first
and
only
warning
that
his
fortunes
had
once
again
changed
came
swiftly
silently
and
with
deadly
promise
one
moment
the
willows
had
moved
gently
in
the
breeze
and
then
a
spear
suddenly
set
them
all
quivering
ross
clutching
the
suit
to
him
with
a
frantic
grab
skated
about
in
the
sand
going
to
one
knee
in
his
haste
he
found
himself
completely
at
the
mercy
of
the
two
men
standing
on
the
bank
well
above
him
unlike
ulffa
people
or
the
beaker
traders
they
were
very
tall
with
heavy
braids
of
light
or
hair
swinging
forward
on
their
wide
chests
their
leather
tunics
hung
to
above
leggings
which
were
bound
to
their
limbs
with
painted
straps
cuff
bracelets
of
copper
ringed
their
forearms
and
necklaces
of
animal
teeth
and
beads
displayed
their
personal
wealth
ross
could
not
remember
having
seen
their
like
on
any
of
the
briefing
tapes
at
the
base
one
spear
had
been
a
warning
but
a
second
was
held
ready
so
ross
made
the
signal
of
surrender
reluctantly
dropping
his
suit
and
raising
his
hands
palm
out
and
shoulder
high
friend
ross
asked
in
the
beaker
tongue
the
traders
ranged
far
and
perhaps
there
was
a
chance
they
had
had
contact
with
this
tribe
the
spear
twirled
and
the
younger
stranger
effortlessly
leaped
down
the
bank
paddling
over
to
ross
to
pick
up
the
suit
he
had
dropped
holding
it
up
while
he
made
some
comment
to
his
companion
he
seemed
fascinated
by
the
fabric
pulling
and
smoothing
it
between
his
hands
and
ross
wondered
if
there
was
a
chance
of
trading
it
for
his
own
freedom
both
men
were
armed
not
only
with
the
daggers
favored
by
the
beaker
folk
but
also
with
axes
when
ross
made
a
slight
effort
to
lower
his
hands
the
man
before
him
reached
to
his
belt
ax
growling
what
was
plainly
a
warning
ross
blinked
realizing
that
they
might
well
knock
him
out
and
leave
him
behind
taking
the
suit
with
them
finally
they
decided
in
favor
of
including
him
in
their
loot
throwing
the
suit
over
one
arm
the
stranger
caught
ross
by
the
shoulder
and
pushed
him
forward
roughly
the
pebbled
beach
was
painful
to
feet
and
the
breeze
which
whipped
about
him
as
he
reached
the
top
of
the
bank
reminded
him
only
too
forcibly
of
his
ordeal
in
the
glacial
world
murdock
was
tempted
to
make
a
sudden
dash
out
on
the
point
of
the
bank
and
dive
into
the
river
but
it
was
already
too
late
the
man
who
was
holding
the
spear
had
moved
behind
him
and
ross
wrist
held
in
a
vise
grip
at
the
small
of
his
back
kept
him
prisoner
as
he
was
pushed
on
into
the
meadow
there
three
shaggy
horses
grazed
their
nose
ropes
gathered
into
the
hands
of
a
third
man
a
sharp
stone
half
buried
in
the
ground
changed
the
pattern
of
the
day
ross
heel
scraped
against
it
and
the
resulting
pain
triggered
his
rebellion
into
explosion
he
threw
himself
backward
his
bruised
heel
sliding
between
the
feet
of
his
captor
bringing
them
both
to
the
ground
with
himself
on
top
the
other
expelled
air
from
his
lungs
in
a
grunt
of
surprise
and
ross
whipped
over
one
hand
grasping
the
hilt
of
the
tribesman
dagger
while
the
other
free
of
that
prisoning
chopped
at
the
fellow
throat
dagger
out
and
ready
ross
faced
the
men
in
a
half
crouch
as
he
had
been
drilled
they
stared
at
him
in
amazement
then
too
late
the
spears
went
up
ross
placed
the
point
of
his
looted
weapon
at
the
throat
of
the
now
quiet
man
by
whom
he
knelt
and
he
spoke
the
language
he
had
learned
from
ulffa
people
you
strike
this
one
dies
they
must
have
read
the
determined
purpose
in
his
eyes
for
slowly
reluctantly
the
spears
went
down
having
gained
so
much
of
a
victory
ross
dared
more
take
he
motioned
to
the
waiting
horses
take
and
go
for
a
moment
he
thought
that
this
time
they
would
meet
his
challenge
but
he
continued
to
hold
the
dagger
above
the
brown
throat
of
the
man
who
was
now
moaning
faintly
his
threat
continued
to
register
for
the
other
man
shrugged
the
suit
from
his
arm
left
it
lying
on
the
ground
and
retreated
holding
the
nose
rope
of
his
horse
he
mounted
waved
the
herder
up
also
and
both
of
them
rode
slowly
away
the
prisoner
was
slowly
coming
around
so
ross
only
had
time
to
pull
on
the
suit
he
had
not
even
fastened
the
breast
studs
before
those
blue
eyes
opened
a
sunburned
hand
flashed
to
a
belt
but
the
dagger
and
ax
which
had
once
hung
there
were
now
in
ross
possession
he
watched
the
tribesman
carefully
as
he
finished
dressing
what
you
do
the
words
were
in
the
speech
of
the
forest
people
distorted
by
a
new
accent
you
go
ross
pointed
to
the
third
horse
the
others
had
left
behind
i
go
he
indicated
the
river
i
take
these
he
patted
the
dagger
and
the
ax
the
other
scowled
not
good
ross
laughed
a
little
hysterically
not
good
you
he
agreed
good
me
to
his
surprise
the
tribesman
stiff
face
relaxed
and
the
fellow
gave
a
bark
of
laughter
he
sat
up
rubbing
at
his
throat
a
big
grin
pulling
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
you
hunter
the
man
pointed
northeast
to
the
woodlands
fringing
the
mountains
ross
shook
his
head
trader
me
trader
the
other
repeated
then
he
tapped
one
of
the
wide
metal
cuffs
at
his
wrist
trade
this
that
more
things
where
ross
pointed
downstream
by
bitter
water
trade
there
the
man
appeared
puzzled
why
you
here
ride
river
water
like
you
ride
he
said
pointing
to
the
horse
ride
on
trees
many
trees
tied
together
trees
break
apart
i
come
here
the
conception
of
a
raft
voyage
apparently
got
across
for
the
tribesman
was
nodding
getting
to
his
feet
he
walked
across
to
take
up
the
nose
rope
of
the
waiting
horse
you
come
camp
foscar
foscar
chief
he
like
you
show
trick
how
you
take
tulka
make
him
sleep
hold
his
ax
knife
ross
hesitated
this
tulka
seemed
friendly
now
but
would
that
friendliness
last
he
shook
his
head
i
go
to
bitter
water
my
chief
there
tulka
was
scowling
again
you
speak
crooked
words
your
chief
there
he
pointed
eastward
with
a
dramatic
stretch
of
the
arm
your
chief
speak
foscar
say
he
give
much
these
he
touched
his
copper
cuffs
good
knives
axes
get
you
back
ross
stared
at
him
without
understanding
ashe
ashe
in
this
camp
offering
a
reward
for
him
but
how
could
that
be
how
you
know
my
chief
tulka
laughed
this
time
derisively
you
wear
shining
skin
your
chief
wear
shiny
skin
he
say
find
other
shiny
skin
give
many
good
things
to
man
who
bring
you
back
shiny
skin
the
suit
from
the
alien
ship
was
it
the
ship
people
ross
remembered
the
light
on
him
as
he
climbed
out
of
the
red
village
he
must
have
been
sighted
by
one
of
the
spacemen
but
why
were
they
searching
for
him
alerting
the
natives
in
an
effort
to
scoop
him
up
what
made
ross
murdock
so
important
that
they
must
have
him
he
only
knew
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
taken
if
he
could
help
it
that
he
had
no
desire
to
meet
this
chief
who
had
offered
treasure
for
his
capture
you
will
come
tulka
went
into
action
his
mount
flashing
forward
almost
in
a
running
leap
at
ross
who
stumbled
back
when
horse
and
rider
loomed
over
him
he
swung
up
the
ax
but
it
was
a
weapon
with
which
he
had
had
no
training
too
heavy
for
him
as
his
blow
met
only
thin
air
the
shoulder
of
the
mount
hit
him
and
ross
went
down
avoiding
by
less
than
a
finger
breadth
the
thud
of
an
unshod
hoof
against
his
skull
then
the
rider
landed
on
him
crushing
him
flat
a
fist
connected
with
his
jaw
and
for
ross
the
sun
went
out
he
found
himself
hanging
across
a
support
which
moved
with
a
rocking
gait
whose
pounding
hurt
his
head
keeping
him
half
dazed
ross
tried
to
move
but
he
realized
that
his
arms
were
behind
his
back
fastened
wrist
to
wrist
and
a
warm
weight
centered
in
the
small
of
his
spine
to
hold
him
face
down
on
a
horse
he
could
do
nothing
except
endure
the
discomfort
as
best
he
could
and
hope
for
a
speedy
end
to
the
gallop
over
his
head
passed
the
cackle
of
speech
he
caught
short
glimpses
of
another
horse
matching
pace
to
the
one
that
carried
him
then
they
swept
into
a
noisy
place
where
the
shouting
of
many
men
made
a
din
the
horse
stopped
and
ross
was
pulled
from
its
back
and
dropped
to
the
trodden
dust
to
lie
blinking
up
dizzily
trying
to
focus
on
the
scene
about
him
they
had
arrived
at
the
camp
of
the
horsemen
whose
hide
tents
served
as
a
backdrop
for
the
fair
giants
and
the
tall
women
hovering
about
to
view
the
captive
the
circle
about
him
then
broke
and
men
stood
aside
for
a
newcomer
ross
had
believed
that
his
original
captors
were
physically
imposing
but
this
one
was
their
master
lying
on
the
ground
at
the
chieftain
feet
ross
felt
like
a
small
and
helpless
child
foscar
if
foscar
this
was
could
not
yet
have
entered
middle
age
and
the
muscles
which
moved
along
his
arms
and
across
his
shoulders
as
he
leaned
over
to
study
tulka
prize
made
him
ross
glared
up
at
him
that
same
hot
rage
which
had
led
to
his
attack
on
tulka
now
urging
him
to
the
only
defiance
he
had
left
words
look
well
foscar
free
me
and
i
would
do
more
than
at
you
he
said
in
the
speech
of
the
woods
hunters
foscar
blue
eyes
widened
and
he
lowered
a
fist
which
could
have
swallowed
in
its
grasp
both
of
ross
hands
linking
those
great
fingers
in
the
stuff
of
the
suit
and
drawing
the
captive
to
his
feet
with
no
sign
that
his
act
had
required
any
effort
even
standing
ross
was
a
good
eight
inches
shorter
than
the
chieftain
yet
he
put
up
his
chin
and
eyed
the
other
squarely
without
giving
ground
so
yet
still
my
hands
are
tied
he
put
into
that
all
the
taunting
inflection
he
could
summon
his
reception
by
tulka
had
given
him
one
faint
clue
to
the
character
of
these
people
they
might
be
brought
to
acknowledge
the
worth
of
one
who
stood
up
to
them
child
the
fist
shifted
from
its
grip
on
the
fabric
covering
chest
to
his
shoulder
and
now
under
its
compulsion
ross
swayed
back
and
forth
child
from
somewhere
ross
raised
that
short
laugh
ask
tulka
i
be
no
child
foscar
tulka
ax
tulka
knife
they
were
in
my
hand
a
horse
tulka
had
to
use
to
bring
me
down
foscar
regarded
him
intently
and
then
grinned
sharp
tongue
he
commented
tulka
lost
knife
ax
so
ennar
he
called
over
his
shoulder
and
one
of
the
men
stepped
out
a
pace
beyond
his
fellows
he
was
shorter
and
much
younger
than
his
chief
with
a
boy
rangy
slimness
and
an
open
face
his
eyes
bright
on
foscar
with
a
kind
of
eager
excitement
like
the
other
tribesmen
he
was
armed
with
belt
dagger
and
ax
and
since
he
wore
two
necklaces
and
both
cuff
bracelets
and
upper
armlets
as
did
foscar
ross
thought
he
must
be
a
relative
of
the
older
man
child
foscar
clapped
his
hand
on
ross
shoulder
and
then
withdrew
the
hold
child
he
indicated
ennar
who
reddened
you
take
from
ennar
ax
knife
foscar
ordered
as
you
took
from
tulka
he
made
a
sign
and
someone
cut
the
thongs
about
ross
wrists
ross
rubbed
one
numbed
hand
against
the
other
setting
his
jaw
foscar
had
stung
his
young
follower
with
that
contemptuous
child
so
the
boy
would
be
eager
to
match
all
his
skill
against
the
prisoner
this
would
not
be
as
easy
as
his
taking
tulka
by
surprise
but
if
he
refused
foscar
might
well
order
him
killed
out
of
hand
he
had
chosen
to
be
defiant
he
would
have
to
do
his
best
take
ax
knife
foscar
stepped
back
waving
at
his
men
to
open
out
a
ring
encircling
the
two
young
men
ross
felt
a
little
sick
as
he
watched
ennar
hand
go
to
the
haft
of
the
ax
nothing
had
been
said
about
ennar
not
using
his
weapons
in
defense
but
ross
discovered
that
there
was
some
sense
of
sportmanship
in
the
tribesmen
after
all
it
was
tulka
who
pushed
to
the
chief
side
and
said
something
which
made
foscar
roar
at
his
youthful
champion
ennar
hand
came
away
from
the
ax
hilt
as
if
that
polished
wood
were
and
he
transferred
his
discomfiture
to
ross
as
the
other
understood
ennar
had
to
win
now
for
his
own
pride
sake
and
ross
felt
had
to
win
for
his
life
they
circled
warily
ross
watching
his
opponent
eyes
rather
than
those
hands
held
at
waist
level
back
at
the
base
he
had
been
matched
with
ashe
and
before
ashe
with
the
skilled
and
merciless
trainers
in
unarmed
combat
he
had
had
beaten
into
his
bruised
flesh
knowledge
of
holds
and
blows
intended
to
save
his
skin
in
just
such
an
encounter
but
then
he
had
been
alert
prepared
he
had
not
been
knocked
silly
and
then
transported
for
miles
slung
across
a
horse
after
days
of
exposure
and
hard
usage
it
remained
to
be
learned
was
ross
murdock
as
tough
as
he
always
thought
himself
to
be
tough
or
not
he
was
in
this
until
he
won
or
dropped
comments
from
the
crowd
aroused
ennar
to
the
first
definite
action
he
charged
stooping
low
in
a
wrestler
stance
but
ross
squatted
even
lower
one
hand
flicked
to
the
churned
dust
of
the
ground
and
snapped
up
again
sending
a
cloud
of
grit
into
the
tribesman
face
then
their
bodies
met
with
a
shock
and
ennar
sailed
over
ross
shoulder
to
skid
along
the
earth
had
ross
been
fresh
the
contest
would
have
ended
there
and
then
in
his
favor
but
when
he
tried
to
whirl
and
throw
himself
on
his
opponent
he
was
too
slow
ennar
was
not
waiting
to
be
pinned
flat
and
it
was
turn
to
be
caught
at
a
disadvantage
a
hand
shot
out
to
catch
his
leg
just
above
the
ankle
and
once
again
ross
obeyed
his
teaching
falling
easily
at
that
pull
to
land
across
his
opponent
ennar
disconcerted
by
the
success
of
his
attack
was
unprepared
for
this
ross
rolled
trying
to
escape
hands
his
own
chopping
out
in
edgewise
blows
striving
to
serve
ennar
as
he
had
tulka
he
had
to
take
a
lot
of
punishment
though
he
managed
to
elude
the
powerful
bear
hug
in
which
he
knew
the
other
was
laboring
to
engulf
him
a
hold
which
would
speedily
crush
him
into
submission
clinging
to
the
methods
he
had
been
taught
he
fought
on
only
now
he
knew
with
a
growing
panic
that
his
best
was
not
good
enough
he
was
too
spent
to
make
an
end
unless
he
had
some
piece
of
great
good
luck
he
could
only
delay
his
own
defeat
fingers
clawed
viciously
at
his
eyes
and
ross
did
what
he
had
never
thought
to
do
in
any
fight
he
snapped
wolfishly
his
teeth
closing
on
flesh
as
he
brought
up
his
knee
and
drove
it
home
into
the
body
wriggling
on
his
there
was
a
gasp
of
hot
breath
in
his
face
as
ross
called
upon
the
last
few
rags
of
his
strength
tearing
loose
from
the
other
slackened
hold
he
scrambled
to
one
knee
ennar
was
also
on
his
knees
crouching
like
a
beast
ready
to
spring
ross
risked
everything
on
a
last
gamble
clasping
his
hands
together
he
raised
them
as
high
as
he
could
and
brought
them
down
on
the
nape
of
the
neck
ennar
sprawled
forward
in
the
dust
where
seconds
later
ross
joined
him
chapter
murdock
lay
on
his
back
gazing
up
at
the
laced
hides
which
stretched
to
make
the
tent
roofing
having
been
battered
just
enough
to
feel
all
one
aching
bruise
ross
had
lost
interest
in
the
future
only
the
present
mattered
and
it
was
a
dark
one
he
might
have
fought
ennar
to
a
standstill
but
in
the
eyes
of
the
horsemen
he
had
also
been
beaten
and
he
had
not
impressed
them
as
he
had
hoped
that
he
still
lived
was
a
minor
wonder
but
he
deduced
that
he
continued
to
breathe
only
because
they
wanted
to
exchange
him
for
the
reward
offered
by
the
aliens
from
out
of
time
an
unpleasant
prospect
to
contemplate
his
wrists
were
lashed
over
his
head
to
a
peg
driven
deeply
into
the
ground
his
ankles
were
bound
to
another
he
could
turn
his
head
from
side
to
side
but
any
further
movement
was
impossible
he
ate
only
bits
of
food
dropped
into
his
mouth
by
a
slave
a
cowed
hunter
captured
from
a
tribe
overwhelmed
in
the
migration
of
the
horsemen
ho
taker
of
axes
a
toe
jarred
into
his
ribs
and
ross
bit
back
the
grunt
of
pain
which
answered
that
rude
bid
for
his
attention
he
saw
in
the
dim
light
ennar
face
and
was
savagely
glad
to
note
the
discolorations
about
the
right
eye
and
along
the
jaw
line
the
signatures
left
by
his
own
skinned
knuckles
ho
warrior
ross
returned
hoarsely
trying
to
lade
that
title
with
all
the
scorn
he
could
summon
ennar
hand
holding
a
knife
swung
into
his
limited
range
of
vision
to
clip
a
sharp
tongue
is
a
good
thing
the
young
tribesman
grinned
as
he
knelt
down
beside
the
helpless
prisoner
ross
knew
a
thrill
of
fear
worse
than
any
pain
ennar
might
be
about
to
do
just
what
he
hinted
instead
the
knife
swung
up
and
ross
felt
the
sawing
at
the
cords
about
his
wrists
enduring
the
pain
in
the
raw
gouges
they
had
cut
in
his
flesh
with
gratitude
that
it
was
not
mutilation
which
had
brought
ennar
to
him
he
knew
that
his
arms
were
free
but
to
draw
them
down
from
over
his
head
was
almost
more
than
he
could
do
and
he
lay
quiet
as
ennar
loosed
his
feet
up
without
ennar
hands
pulling
at
him
ross
could
not
have
reached
his
feet
nor
did
he
stay
erect
once
he
had
been
raised
crashing
forward
on
his
face
as
the
other
let
him
go
hot
anger
eating
at
him
because
of
his
own
helplessness
in
the
end
ennar
summoned
two
slaves
who
dragged
ross
into
the
open
where
a
council
assembled
about
a
fire
a
debate
was
in
progress
sometimes
so
heated
that
the
speakers
fingered
their
knife
or
ax
hilts
when
they
shouted
their
arguments
ross
could
not
understand
their
language
but
he
was
certain
that
he
was
the
subject
under
discussion
and
that
foscar
had
the
deciding
vote
and
had
not
yet
given
the
nod
to
either
side
ross
sat
where
the
slaves
had
dumped
him
rubbing
his
smarting
wrists
so
deathly
weary
in
mind
and
beaten
in
body
that
he
was
not
really
interested
in
the
fate
they
were
planning
for
him
he
was
content
merely
to
be
free
of
his
bonds
a
small
favor
but
one
he
savored
dully
he
did
not
know
how
long
the
debate
lasted
but
at
length
ennar
came
to
stand
over
him
with
a
message
your
chief
he
give
many
good
things
for
you
foscar
take
you
to
him
my
chief
is
not
here
ross
repeated
wearily
making
a
protest
he
knew
they
would
not
heed
my
chief
sits
by
the
bitter
water
and
waits
he
will
be
angry
if
i
do
not
come
let
foscar
fear
his
anger
ennar
laughed
you
run
from
your
chief
he
will
be
happy
with
foscar
when
you
lie
again
under
his
hand
you
will
not
like
that
i
think
it
so
i
think
so
too
ross
agreed
silently
he
spent
the
rest
of
that
night
lying
between
the
watchful
ennar
and
another
guard
though
they
had
the
humanity
not
to
bind
him
again
in
the
morning
he
was
allowed
to
feed
himself
and
he
fished
chunks
of
venison
out
of
a
stew
with
his
unwashed
fingers
but
in
spite
of
the
messiness
it
was
the
best
food
he
had
eaten
in
days
the
trip
however
was
not
to
be
a
comfortable
one
he
was
mounted
on
one
of
the
shaggy
horses
a
rope
run
under
the
animal
belly
to
loop
one
foot
to
the
other
fortunately
his
hands
were
bound
so
he
was
able
to
grasp
the
coarse
wiry
mane
and
keep
his
seat
after
a
fashion
the
nose
rope
of
his
mount
was
passed
to
tulka
and
ennar
rode
beside
him
with
only
half
an
eye
for
the
path
of
his
own
horse
and
the
balance
of
his
attention
for
the
prisoner
they
headed
northeast
with
the
mountains
as
a
sharp
goal
against
the
morning
sky
though
ross
sense
of
direction
was
not
too
acute
he
was
certain
that
they
were
making
for
the
general
vicinity
of
the
hidden
village
which
he
believed
the
ship
people
had
destroyed
he
tried
to
discover
something
of
the
nature
of
the
contact
which
had
been
made
between
the
aliens
and
the
horsemen
how
find
other
chief
he
asked
ennar
the
young
man
tossed
one
of
his
braids
back
across
his
shoulder
and
turned
his
head
to
face
ross
squarely
your
chief
come
our
camp
talk
with
foscar
two
four
sleeps
ago
how
talk
with
foscar
with
hunter
talk
for
the
first
time
ennar
did
not
appear
altogether
certain
he
scowled
and
then
snapped
he
talk
foscar
us
we
hear
right
words
not
woods
creeper
talk
he
speak
to
us
good
ross
was
puzzled
how
could
the
alien
out
of
time
speak
the
proper
language
of
a
primitive
tribe
some
thousands
of
years
removed
from
his
own
era
were
the
ship
people
also
familiar
with
time
travel
did
they
have
their
own
stations
of
transfer
yet
their
fury
with
the
reds
had
been
hot
this
was
a
complete
mystery
this
chief
he
look
like
me
again
ennar
appeared
at
a
loss
he
wear
covering
like
you
but
was
he
like
me
persisted
ross
he
did
know
what
he
was
trying
to
learn
only
that
it
seemed
important
at
that
moment
to
press
home
to
at
least
one
of
the
tribesmen
that
he
different
from
the
man
who
had
put
a
price
on
his
head
and
to
whom
he
was
to
be
sold
not
like
tulka
spoke
over
his
shoulder
you
look
like
hunter
people
hair
eyes
strange
chief
no
hair
on
head
eyes
not
like
you
saw
him
too
ross
demanded
eagerly
i
saw
i
ride
to
camp
they
come
so
stand
on
rock
call
to
foscar
make
magic
with
fire
it
jump
up
he
pointed
his
arm
stiffly
at
a
bush
before
them
on
the
trail
they
point
little
little
spear
fire
come
out
of
the
ground
and
burn
they
say
burn
our
camp
if
we
do
not
give
them
man
we
say
not
have
man
then
they
say
many
good
things
for
us
if
we
find
and
bring
man
but
they
are
not
my
people
ross
cut
in
you
see
i
have
hair
i
am
not
like
them
they
are
bad
you
may
be
taken
in
war
by
them
chief
slave
ennar
had
a
reply
to
that
which
was
logical
according
to
the
customs
of
his
own
tribe
they
want
slave
back
it
is
so
my
people
strong
too
much
magic
ross
pushed
take
me
to
bitter
water
and
they
pay
much
more
than
stranger
chief
both
tribesmen
were
amused
where
bitter
water
asked
tulka
ross
jerked
his
head
to
the
west
some
sleeps
away
some
sleeps
repeated
ennar
jeeringly
we
ride
some
sleeps
maybe
many
sleeps
where
we
know
not
the
trails
maybe
no
people
there
maybe
no
bitter
water
all
things
you
say
with
split
tongue
so
that
we
not
give
you
back
to
master
we
go
this
way
not
even
one
sleep
find
chief
get
good
things
why
we
do
hard
thing
when
we
can
do
easy
what
argument
could
ross
offer
in
rebuttal
to
the
simple
logic
of
his
captors
for
a
moment
he
raged
inwardly
at
his
own
helplessness
but
long
ago
he
had
learned
that
giving
away
to
hot
fury
was
no
good
unless
one
did
it
deliberately
to
impress
and
then
only
when
one
had
the
upper
hand
now
ross
had
no
hand
at
all
for
the
most
part
they
kept
to
the
open
whereas
ross
and
the
other
two
agents
had
skulked
in
wooded
areas
on
their
flight
through
this
same
territory
so
they
approached
the
mountains
from
a
different
angle
and
though
he
tried
ross
could
pick
out
no
familiar
landmarks
if
by
some
miracle
he
was
able
to
free
himself
from
his
captors
he
could
only
head
due
west
and
hope
to
strike
the
river
at
midday
their
party
made
camp
in
a
grove
of
trees
by
a
spring
the
weather
was
as
unseasonably
warm
as
it
had
been
the
day
before
and
flies
brought
out
of
hiding
attacked
the
stamping
horses
and
crawled
over
ross
he
tried
to
keep
them
off
with
swings
of
his
bound
hands
for
their
bites
drew
blood
having
been
tumbled
from
his
mount
he
remained
fastened
to
a
tree
with
a
noose
about
his
neck
while
the
horsemen
built
a
fire
and
broiled
strips
of
deer
meat
it
would
seem
that
foscar
was
in
no
hurry
to
get
on
since
after
they
had
eaten
the
men
continued
to
lounge
at
ease
some
even
dropping
off
to
sleep
when
ross
counted
faces
he
learned
that
tulka
and
another
had
both
disappeared
possibly
to
contact
and
warn
the
aliens
they
were
coming
it
was
midafternoon
before
the
scouts
reappeared
as
unobtrusively
as
they
had
gone
they
went
before
foscar
with
a
report
which
brought
the
chief
over
to
ross
we
go
your
chief
waits
ross
raised
his
swollen
bitten
face
and
made
his
usual
protest
not
my
chief
foscar
shrugged
he
say
so
he
give
good
things
to
get
you
back
under
his
hand
so
he
your
chief
once
again
ross
was
boosted
on
his
mount
and
bound
but
this
time
the
party
split
into
two
groups
as
they
rode
off
he
was
with
ennar
again
just
behind
foscar
with
two
other
guards
bringing
up
the
rear
the
rest
of
the
men
leading
their
mounts
melted
into
the
trees
ross
watched
that
quiet
withdrawal
speculatively
it
argued
that
foscar
did
not
trust
those
he
was
about
to
do
business
with
that
he
was
taking
certain
precautions
of
his
own
only
ross
could
not
see
how
that
distrust
which
might
be
only
ordinary
prudence
on
foscar
part
could
in
any
way
be
an
advantage
for
him
they
rode
at
a
pace
hardly
above
a
walk
into
a
small
open
meadow
narrowing
at
the
east
then
for
the
first
time
ross
was
able
to
place
himself
they
were
at
the
entrance
to
the
valley
of
the
village
about
a
mile
away
from
the
narrow
throat
above
which
ross
had
lain
to
spy
and
had
been
captured
for
he
had
come
from
the
north
over
the
spurs
of
rising
ridges
ross
horse
was
pulled
up
as
foscar
drove
his
heel
into
the
ribs
of
his
own
mount
sending
it
at
a
brisker
pace
toward
the
neck
of
the
valley
there
was
a
blot
of
blue
there
more
than
one
of
the
aliens
were
waiting
ross
caught
his
lip
between
his
teeth
and
bit
down
on
it
hard
he
had
stood
up
to
the
reds
to
foscar
tribesmen
but
he
shrank
from
meeting
those
strangers
with
an
odd
fear
that
the
worst
the
men
of
his
own
species
could
do
would
be
but
a
pale
shadow
to
the
treatment
he
might
meet
at
their
hands
foscar
was
now
a
toy
man
astride
a
toy
horse
he
halted
his
galloping
mount
to
sit
facing
the
handful
of
strangers
ross
counted
four
of
them
they
seemed
to
be
talking
though
there
was
still
a
good
distance
separating
the
mounted
man
and
the
blue
suits
minutes
passed
before
foscar
arm
raised
in
a
wave
to
summon
the
party
guarding
ross
ennar
kicked
his
horse
to
a
trot
towing
ross
mount
behind
the
other
two
men
thudding
along
more
discreetly
ross
noted
that
they
were
both
armed
with
spears
which
they
carried
to
the
fore
as
they
rode
they
were
perhaps
three
quarters
of
the
way
to
join
foscar
and
ross
could
see
plainly
the
bald
heads
of
the
aliens
as
their
faces
turned
in
his
direction
then
the
strangers
struck
one
of
them
raised
a
weapon
shaped
similarly
to
the
automatic
ross
knew
except
that
it
was
longer
in
the
barrel
ross
did
not
know
why
he
cried
out
except
that
foscar
had
only
an
ax
and
dagger
which
were
both
still
sheathed
at
his
belt
the
chief
sat
very
still
and
then
his
horse
gave
a
swift
sidewise
swerve
as
if
in
fright
foscar
collapsed
limp
bonelessly
to
the
trodden
turf
to
lie
unmoving
face
down
ennar
whooped
a
cry
combining
defiance
and
despair
in
one
he
reined
up
with
violence
enough
to
set
his
horse
rearing
then
dropping
his
hold
on
the
leading
rope
of
ross
mount
he
whirled
and
set
off
in
a
wild
dash
for
the
trees
to
the
left
a
spear
lanced
across
ross
shoulder
ripping
at
the
blue
fabric
but
his
horse
whirled
to
follow
the
other
taking
him
out
of
danger
of
a
second
thrust
having
lost
his
opportunity
the
man
who
had
wielded
the
spear
dashed
by
at
back
ross
clung
to
the
mane
with
both
hands
his
greatest
fear
was
that
he
might
slip
from
the
saddle
pad
and
since
he
was
tied
by
his
feet
lie
unprotected
and
helpless
under
those
dashing
hoofs
somehow
he
managed
to
cling
to
the
horse
neck
his
face
lashed
by
the
rough
mane
while
the
animal
pounded
on
had
ross
been
able
to
grasp
the
dangling
nose
rope
he
might
have
had
a
faint
chance
of
controlling
that
run
but
as
it
was
he
could
only
hold
fast
and
hope
he
had
only
broken
glimpses
of
what
lay
ahead
then
a
brilliant
fire
as
vivid
as
the
flames
which
had
eaten
up
the
red
village
burst
from
the
ground
a
few
yards
ahead
sending
the
horse
wild
there
was
more
fire
and
the
horse
changed
course
through
the
rising
smoke
ross
realized
that
the
aliens
were
trying
to
cut
him
off
from
the
thin
safety
of
the
woodlands
why
they
did
just
shoot
him
as
they
had
foscar
he
could
not
understand
the
smoke
of
the
burning
grass
was
thick
cutting
between
him
and
the
woods
might
it
also
provide
a
curtain
behind
which
he
could
hope
to
escape
both
parties
the
fire
was
sending
the
horse
back
toward
the
waiting
ship
people
ross
could
hear
a
confused
shouting
in
the
smoke
then
his
mount
made
a
miscalculation
and
a
tongue
of
red
licked
too
close
the
animal
screamed
dashing
on
blindly
straight
between
two
of
the
blazes
and
away
from
the
men
ross
coughed
almost
choking
his
eyes
watering
as
the
stench
of
singed
hair
thickened
the
smoke
but
he
had
been
carried
out
of
the
fire
circle
and
was
shooting
back
into
the
meadowland
mount
and
unwilling
rider
were
well
away
from
the
upper
end
of
that
cleared
space
when
another
horse
cut
in
from
the
left
matching
speed
to
the
uncontrolled
animal
to
which
ross
clung
it
was
one
of
the
tribesmen
riding
easily
the
trick
worked
for
the
wild
race
slowed
to
a
gallop
and
the
other
rider
in
a
feat
of
horsemanship
at
which
ross
marveled
leaned
from
his
seat
to
catch
the
dangling
nose
rope
bringing
the
runaway
against
his
own
steady
steed
ross
shaken
still
coughing
from
the
smoke
and
unable
to
sit
upright
held
to
the
mane
the
gallop
slowed
to
a
rocking
pace
and
finally
came
to
a
halt
both
horses
blowing
patches
on
their
chests
and
their
riders
legs
having
made
his
capture
the
tribesman
seemed
indifferent
to
ross
looking
back
instead
at
the
wide
curtain
of
grass
smoke
frowning
as
he
studied
the
swift
spread
of
the
fire
muttering
to
himself
he
pulled
the
lead
rope
and
brought
ross
horse
to
follow
in
the
direction
from
which
ennar
had
brought
the
captive
less
than
a
half
hour
earlier
ross
tried
to
think
the
unexpected
death
of
their
chief
might
well
mean
his
own
should
the
tribe
desire
for
vengeance
now
be
aroused
on
the
other
hand
there
was
a
faint
chance
that
he
could
now
better
impress
them
with
the
thought
that
he
was
indeed
of
another
clan
and
that
to
aid
him
would
be
to
work
against
a
common
enemy
but
it
was
hard
to
plan
clearly
though
wits
alone
could
save
him
now
the
parley
which
had
ended
with
foscar
murder
had
brought
ross
a
small
measure
of
time
he
was
still
a
captive
even
though
of
the
tribesmen
and
not
the
unearthly
strangers
perhaps
to
the
ship
people
these
primitives
were
hardly
higher
in
scale
than
the
forest
animals
ross
did
not
try
to
talk
to
his
present
guard
who
towed
him
into
the
western
sun
of
late
afternoon
they
halted
at
last
in
that
same
small
grove
where
they
had
rested
at
noon
the
tribesman
fastened
the
mounts
and
then
walked
around
to
inspect
the
animal
ross
had
ridden
with
a
grunt
he
loosened
the
prisoner
and
spilled
him
unceremoniously
on
the
ground
while
he
examined
the
horse
ross
levered
himself
up
to
sight
the
mark
of
the
burn
across
that
roan
hide
where
the
fire
had
blistered
the
skin
thick
handfuls
of
mud
from
the
side
of
the
spring
were
brought
and
plastered
over
the
seared
strip
then
having
rubbed
down
both
animals
with
twists
of
grass
the
man
came
over
to
ross
pushed
him
back
to
the
ground
and
studied
his
left
leg
ross
understood
by
rights
his
thigh
should
also
have
been
scorched
where
the
flame
had
hit
yet
he
had
felt
no
pain
now
as
the
tribesman
examined
him
for
a
burn
he
could
not
see
even
the
faintest
discoloration
of
the
strange
fabric
he
remembered
how
the
aliens
had
strolled
unconcerned
through
the
burning
village
as
the
suit
had
insulated
him
against
the
cold
of
the
ice
so
it
would
seem
that
it
had
also
protected
him
against
the
fire
for
which
he
was
duly
thankful
his
escape
from
injury
was
a
puzzle
to
the
tribesman
who
failing
to
find
any
trace
of
burn
on
him
left
ross
alone
and
went
to
sit
well
away
from
his
prisoner
as
if
he
feared
him
they
did
not
have
long
to
wait
one
by
one
those
who
had
ridden
in
foscar
company
gathered
at
the
grove
the
very
last
to
come
were
ennar
and
tulka
carrying
the
body
of
their
chief
the
faces
of
both
men
were
smeared
with
dust
and
when
the
others
sighted
the
body
they
too
rubbed
dust
into
their
cheeks
reciting
a
string
of
words
and
going
one
by
one
to
touch
the
dead
chieftain
right
hand
ennar
resigning
his
burden
to
the
others
slid
from
his
tired
horse
and
stood
for
a
long
moment
his
head
bowed
then
he
gazed
straight
at
ross
and
came
across
the
tiny
clearing
to
stand
over
the
man
of
a
later
time
the
boyishness
which
had
been
a
part
of
him
when
he
had
fought
at
foscar
command
was
gone
his
eyes
were
merciless
as
he
leaned
down
to
speak
shaping
each
word
with
slow
care
so
that
ross
could
understand
the
promise
that
frightful
promise
woods
rat
foscar
goes
to
his
burial
fire
and
he
shall
take
a
slave
with
him
to
serve
him
beyond
the
sky
a
slave
to
run
at
his
voice
to
shake
when
he
thunders
you
shall
run
for
foscar
beyond
the
sky
and
he
shall
have
you
forever
to
walk
upon
as
a
man
walks
upon
the
earth
i
ennar
swear
that
foscar
shall
be
sent
to
the
chiefs
in
the
sky
in
all
honor
and
that
you
shall
lie
at
his
feet
in
that
going
he
did
not
touch
ross
but
there
was
no
doubt
in
ross
mind
that
he
meant
every
word
he
spoke
chapter
the
preparations
for
foscar
funeral
went
on
through
the
night
a
wooden
structure
made
up
of
tied
fagots
dragged
in
from
the
woodland
grew
taller
beyond
the
big
tribal
camp
the
constant
crooning
wail
of
the
women
in
the
tents
produced
a
minor
murmur
of
sound
enough
to
drive
a
man
to
the
edge
of
madness
ross
had
been
left
under
guard
where
he
could
watch
it
all
a
refinement
of
torture
which
he
would
earlier
have
believed
too
subtle
for
ennar
though
the
older
men
carried
minor
commands
among
the
horsemen
because
ennar
was
the
closest
of
blood
kin
among
the
adult
males
he
was
in
charge
of
the
coming
ceremony
the
pick
of
the
horse
herd
a
roan
stallion
was
brought
in
to
be
picketed
near
ross
as
sacrifice
number
two
and
two
of
the
hounds
were
in
turn
leashed
close
by
foscar
his
best
weapons
to
hand
and
a
red
cloak
lapped
about
him
lay
waiting
on
a
bier
squatted
the
tribal
wizard
shaking
his
thunder
rattle
and
chanting
in
a
voice
which
approached
a
shriek
this
wild
activity
might
have
been
a
scene
lifted
directly
from
some
tape
stored
at
the
project
base
it
was
very
difficult
for
ross
to
remember
that
this
was
reality
that
he
was
to
be
one
of
the
main
actors
in
the
coming
event
with
no
timely
aid
from
operation
retrograde
to
snatch
him
to
safety
sometime
during
that
nightmare
he
slept
his
weariness
of
body
overcoming
him
he
awoke
dazed
to
find
a
hand
clutching
his
mop
of
hair
pulling
his
head
up
you
sleep
you
do
not
fear
foscar
groggily
ross
blinked
up
fear
sure
he
was
afraid
fear
he
realized
with
a
clear
thrust
of
consciousness
such
as
he
had
seldom
experienced
before
had
always
stalked
beside
him
slept
in
his
bed
but
he
had
never
surrendered
to
it
and
he
would
not
now
if
he
could
help
it
i
do
not
fear
he
threw
that
creed
into
ennar
face
in
one
hot
boast
he
not
fear
we
shall
see
if
you
speak
so
loudly
when
the
fire
bites
you
the
other
spat
yet
in
that
oath
there
was
a
reluctant
recognition
of
courage
when
the
fire
bites
that
sang
in
ross
head
there
was
something
else
if
he
could
only
remember
up
to
that
moment
he
had
kept
a
poor
little
shadow
of
hope
it
is
always
impossible
he
was
conscious
again
with
that
strange
clarity
of
mind
for
a
man
to
face
his
own
death
honestly
a
man
always
continues
to
believe
to
the
last
moment
of
his
life
that
something
will
intervene
to
save
him
the
men
led
the
horse
to
the
mound
of
fagots
which
was
now
crowned
with
foscar
bier
the
stallion
went
quietly
until
a
tall
tribesman
struck
true
with
an
ax
and
the
animal
fell
the
hounds
were
also
killed
and
laid
at
their
dead
master
feet
but
ross
was
not
to
fare
so
easily
the
wizard
danced
about
him
a
hideous
figure
in
a
beast
mask
a
curled
fringe
of
dried
snakeskins
swaying
from
his
belt
shaking
his
rattle
he
squawked
like
an
angry
cat
as
they
pulled
ross
to
the
stacked
wood
fire
there
was
something
about
fire
if
he
could
only
remember
ross
stumbled
and
nearly
fell
across
one
leg
of
the
dead
horse
they
were
propping
into
place
then
he
remembered
that
tongue
of
flame
in
the
meadow
grass
which
had
burned
the
horse
but
not
the
rider
his
hands
and
his
head
would
have
no
protection
but
the
rest
of
his
body
was
covered
with
the
fabric
of
the
alien
suit
could
he
do
it
there
was
such
a
slight
chance
and
they
were
already
pushing
him
onto
that
mound
his
hands
tied
ennar
stooped
and
bound
his
ankles
securing
him
to
the
brush
so
fastened
they
left
him
the
tribe
ringed
around
the
pyre
at
a
safe
distance
ennar
and
five
other
men
approaching
from
different
directions
torches
aflame
ross
watched
those
blazing
knots
thrust
into
the
brush
and
heard
the
crackle
of
the
fire
his
eyes
hard
and
measuring
studied
the
flash
of
flame
from
dried
brush
to
seasoned
wood
a
tongue
of
flame
licked
up
at
him
ross
hardly
dared
to
breathe
as
it
wreathed
about
his
foot
his
hide
fetters
smoldering
the
insulation
of
the
suit
did
not
cut
all
the
heat
but
it
allowed
him
to
stay
put
for
the
few
seconds
he
needed
to
make
his
escape
spectacular
the
flame
had
eaten
through
his
foot
bonds
and
yet
the
burning
sensation
on
his
feet
and
legs
was
no
greater
than
it
would
have
been
from
the
direct
rays
of
a
bright
summer
sun
ross
moistened
his
lips
with
his
tongue
the
impact
of
heat
on
his
hands
and
his
face
was
different
he
leaned
down
held
his
wrists
to
the
flame
taking
in
stoical
silence
the
burns
which
freed
him
then
as
the
fire
curled
up
so
that
he
seemed
to
stand
in
a
frame
of
writhing
red
banners
ross
leaped
through
that
curtain
protecting
his
bowed
head
with
his
arms
as
best
he
could
but
to
the
onlookers
it
seemed
he
passed
unhurt
through
the
heart
of
a
roaring
fire
he
kept
his
footing
and
stood
facing
that
part
of
the
tribal
ring
directly
before
him
he
heard
a
cry
perhaps
of
fear
and
a
blazing
torch
flew
through
the
air
and
struck
his
hip
although
he
felt
the
force
of
the
blow
the
burning
bits
of
the
head
merely
slid
down
his
thigh
and
leg
leaving
no
mark
on
the
smooth
blue
fabric
ahhhhhhh
now
the
wizard
capered
before
him
shaking
his
rattle
to
make
a
deafening
din
ross
struck
out
slapping
the
sorcerer
out
of
his
path
and
stooped
to
pick
up
the
smoldering
brand
which
had
been
thrown
at
him
whirling
it
about
his
head
though
every
movement
was
torture
to
his
scorched
hands
he
set
it
flaming
once
more
holding
it
in
front
of
him
as
a
weapon
he
stalked
directly
at
the
men
and
women
before
him
the
torch
was
a
poor
enough
defense
against
spears
and
axes
but
ross
did
not
care
he
put
into
this
last
gamble
all
the
determination
he
could
summon
nor
did
he
realize
what
a
figure
he
presented
to
the
tribesmen
a
man
who
had
crossed
a
curtain
of
fire
without
apparent
hurt
who
appeared
to
wash
in
tongues
of
flame
without
harm
and
who
now
called
upon
fire
in
turn
as
a
weapon
was
no
man
but
a
demon
the
wall
of
people
wavered
and
broke
women
screamed
and
ran
men
shouted
but
no
one
threw
a
spear
or
struck
with
an
ax
ross
walked
on
a
man
possessed
looking
neither
to
the
right
or
left
he
was
in
the
camp
now
stalking
toward
the
fire
burning
before
foscar
tent
he
did
not
turn
aside
for
that
either
but
holding
the
torch
high
strode
through
the
heart
of
the
flames
risking
further
burns
for
the
sake
of
insuring
his
ultimate
safety
the
tribesmen
melted
away
as
he
approached
the
last
line
of
tents
with
the
open
land
beyond
the
horses
of
the
herd
which
had
been
driven
to
this
side
to
avoid
the
funeral
pyre
were
shifting
nervously
the
scent
of
burning
making
them
uneasy
once
more
ross
whirled
the
dying
torch
about
his
head
recalling
how
the
aliens
had
sent
his
horse
mad
he
tossed
it
behind
him
into
the
grass
between
the
tents
and
the
herd
the
stuff
caught
immediately
now
if
the
men
tried
to
ride
after
him
they
would
have
trouble
without
hindrance
he
walked
across
the
meadow
at
the
same
even
pace
never
turning
to
look
behind
his
hands
were
two
separate
worlds
of
smarting
pain
his
hair
and
eyebrows
were
singed
and
a
finger
of
burn
ran
along
the
angle
of
his
jaw
but
he
was
free
and
he
did
not
believe
that
foscar
men
would
be
in
any
haste
to
pursue
him
somewhere
before
him
lay
the
river
the
river
which
ran
to
the
sea
ross
walked
on
in
the
sunny
morning
while
behind
him
black
smoke
raised
a
dark
beacon
to
the
sky
afterward
he
guessed
that
he
must
have
been
lightheaded
for
several
days
remembering
little
save
the
pain
in
his
hands
and
the
fact
that
it
was
necessary
to
keep
moving
once
he
fell
to
his
knees
and
buried
both
hands
in
the
cool
moist
earth
where
a
thread
of
stream
trickled
from
a
pool
the
muck
seemed
to
draw
out
a
little
of
the
agony
while
he
drank
with
a
fever
thirst
ross
seemed
to
move
through
a
haze
which
lifted
at
intervals
during
which
he
noted
his
surroundings
was
able
to
recall
a
little
of
what
lay
behind
him
and
to
keep
to
the
correct
route
however
the
gaps
of
time
in
between
were
forever
lost
to
him
he
stumbled
along
the
banks
of
a
river
and
fronted
a
bear
fishing
the
massive
beast
rose
on
its
hind
legs
growled
and
ross
walked
by
it
uncaring
unmenaced
by
the
puzzled
animal
sometimes
he
slept
through
the
dark
periods
which
marked
the
nights
or
he
stumbled
along
under
the
moon
nursing
his
hands
against
his
breast
whimpering
a
little
when
his
foot
slipped
and
the
jar
of
that
mishap
ran
through
his
body
once
he
heard
singing
only
to
realize
that
it
was
himself
who
sang
hoarsely
a
melody
which
would
be
popular
thousands
of
years
later
in
the
world
through
which
he
wavered
but
always
ross
knew
that
he
must
go
on
using
that
thick
stream
of
running
water
as
a
guide
to
his
final
goal
the
sea
after
a
long
while
those
spaces
of
mental
clarity
grew
longer
appearing
closer
together
he
dug
small
shelled
things
from
under
stones
along
the
river
and
ate
them
avidly
once
he
clubbed
a
rabbit
and
feasted
he
sucked
birds
eggs
from
a
nest
hidden
among
some
reeds
just
enough
to
keep
his
gaunt
body
going
though
his
gray
eyes
were
now
set
in
what
was
almost
a
ross
did
not
know
just
when
he
realized
that
he
was
again
being
hunted
it
started
with
an
uneasiness
which
differed
from
his
previous
hallucinations
this
was
an
inner
pulling
a
growing
compulsion
to
turn
and
retrace
his
way
back
toward
the
mountains
to
meet
something
or
someone
waiting
for
him
on
the
backward
path
but
ross
kept
on
fearing
sleep
now
and
fighting
it
for
once
he
had
lain
down
to
rest
and
had
wakened
on
his
feet
heading
back
as
if
that
compulsion
had
the
power
to
take
over
his
body
when
his
waking
will
was
off
guard
so
he
rested
but
he
dared
not
sleep
the
desire
constantly
tearing
at
his
will
striving
to
take
over
his
weakened
body
and
draw
it
back
perhaps
against
all
reason
he
believed
that
it
was
the
aliens
who
were
trying
to
control
him
ross
did
not
even
venture
to
guess
why
they
were
so
determined
to
get
him
if
there
were
tribesmen
on
his
trail
as
well
he
did
not
know
but
he
was
sure
that
this
was
now
purely
a
war
of
wills
as
the
banks
of
the
river
were
giving
way
to
marshes
he
had
to
wade
through
mud
and
water
detouring
the
boggy
sections
great
clouds
of
birds
whirled
and
shrieked
their
protests
at
his
coming
and
sleek
water
animals
paddled
and
poked
curious
heads
out
of
the
water
as
this
thing
walked
mechanically
through
their
green
land
always
that
pull
was
with
him
until
ross
was
more
aware
of
fighting
it
than
of
traveling
why
did
they
want
him
to
return
why
did
they
not
follow
him
or
were
they
afraid
to
venture
too
far
from
where
they
had
come
through
the
transfer
yet
the
unseen
rope
which
was
tugging
at
him
did
not
grow
less
tenuous
as
he
put
more
distance
between
himself
and
the
mountain
valley
ross
could
understand
neither
their
motives
nor
their
methods
but
he
could
continue
to
fight
the
bog
was
endless
he
found
an
island
and
lashed
himself
with
his
suit
belt
to
the
single
willow
which
grew
there
knowing
that
he
must
have
sleep
or
he
could
not
hope
to
last
through
the
next
day
then
he
slept
only
to
waken
cold
shaking
and
afraid
shoulder
deep
in
a
pool
he
was
aware
that
in
his
sleep
he
must
have
opened
the
belt
buckle
and
freed
himself
and
only
the
mishap
of
falling
into
the
water
had
brought
him
around
to
sanity
somehow
he
got
back
to
the
tree
rehooked
the
buckle
and
twisted
the
belt
around
the
branches
so
that
he
was
sure
he
could
not
work
it
free
until
daybreak
he
lapsed
into
a
deepening
doze
and
awoke
still
safely
anchored
with
the
morning
cries
of
the
birds
ross
considered
the
suit
as
he
untangled
the
belt
could
the
strange
clothing
be
the
tie
by
which
the
aliens
held
to
him
if
he
were
to
strip
leaving
the
garment
behind
would
he
be
safe
he
tried
to
force
open
the
studs
across
his
chest
but
they
would
not
yield
to
the
slight
pressure
which
was
all
his
seared
fingers
could
exert
and
when
he
pulled
at
the
fabric
he
was
unable
to
tear
it
so
still
wearing
the
livery
of
the
men
ross
continued
on
his
way
hardly
caring
where
he
went
or
how
the
mud
plastered
on
him
by
his
frequent
falls
was
some
protection
against
the
swarm
of
insect
life
his
passing
stirred
into
attack
however
he
was
able
to
endure
a
swollen
face
and
slitted
eyes
being
far
more
conscious
of
the
wrenching
feeling
within
him
than
the
misery
of
his
body
the
character
of
the
marsh
began
to
change
once
more
the
river
was
splitting
into
a
dozen
smaller
streams
shaping
out
fanlike
looking
down
at
this
from
one
of
the
marsh
hillocks
ross
knew
a
faint
surge
of
relief
such
a
place
had
been
on
the
map
ashe
had
made
them
memorize
he
was
close
to
the
sea
at
last
and
for
the
moment
that
was
enough
a
wind
cut
at
him
with
the
force
of
a
fist
in
the
face
in
the
absence
of
sunlight
the
leaden
clouds
overhead
set
a
winterlike
gloom
across
the
countryside
to
the
constant
sound
of
birdcalls
ross
tramped
heavily
through
small
pools
beating
a
path
through
tangles
of
marsh
grass
he
stole
eggs
from
nests
sucking
his
nourishment
eagerly
with
no
dislike
for
the
fishy
flavor
and
drinking
from
stagnant
brackish
ponds
suddenly
ross
halted
at
first
thinking
that
the
continuous
roll
of
sound
he
heard
was
thunder
yet
the
clouds
overhead
were
massed
no
more
than
before
and
there
was
no
sign
of
lightning
continuing
on
he
realized
that
the
mysterious
sound
was
the
pounding
of
surf
he
was
near
the
sea
willing
his
body
to
run
he
weaved
forward
at
a
reeling
trot
pitting
all
his
energy
against
the
incessant
pull
from
behind
his
feet
skidded
out
of
marsh
mud
into
sand
ahead
of
him
were
dark
rocks
surrounded
by
the
white
lace
of
spray
ross
headed
straight
toward
that
spray
until
he
stood
in
the
curling
water
and
felt
its
tug
on
his
body
almost
as
strong
as
that
other
tug
upon
his
mind
he
knelt
letting
the
salt
water
sting
to
life
every
cut
every
burn
sputtering
as
it
filled
his
mouth
and
nostrils
washing
from
him
the
slime
of
the
bog
lands
it
was
cold
and
bitter
but
it
was
the
sea
he
had
made
it
ross
murdock
staggered
back
and
sat
down
suddenly
in
the
sand
glancing
about
he
saw
that
his
refuge
was
a
rough
triangle
between
two
of
the
small
river
arms
littered
with
the
debris
of
the
spring
floods
which
had
grounded
here
after
rejection
by
the
sea
although
there
was
plenty
of
material
for
a
fire
he
had
no
means
of
kindling
a
flame
having
lost
the
flint
all
beaker
traders
carried
for
such
a
purpose
this
was
the
sea
and
against
all
odds
he
had
reached
it
he
lay
back
his
restored
to
the
point
where
he
dared
once
more
to
consider
the
future
he
watched
the
swooping
flight
of
gulls
drawing
patterns
under
the
clouds
above
for
the
moment
he
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
lie
here
and
rest
but
he
did
not
surrender
to
this
first
demand
of
his
body
for
long
hungry
and
cold
sure
that
a
storm
was
coming
he
knew
he
had
to
build
a
fire
a
fire
on
shore
could
provide
him
with
the
means
of
signaling
the
sub
hardly
knowing
why
because
one
part
of
the
coastline
was
as
good
as
another
ross
began
to
walk
again
threading
a
path
in
and
out
among
the
rocky
outcrops
so
he
found
it
a
hollow
between
two
such
windbreaks
within
which
was
a
blackened
circle
of
small
stones
holding
charred
wood
with
some
empty
shells
piled
here
was
unmistakable
evidence
of
a
camp
ross
plunged
forward
thrusting
a
hand
impetuously
into
the
black
mass
of
the
dead
fire
to
his
astonishment
he
touched
warmth
hardly
daring
to
disturb
those
precious
bits
of
charcoal
he
dug
around
them
then
carefully
blew
into
what
appeared
to
be
dead
ashes
there
was
an
answering
glow
he
could
not
have
just
imagined
it
from
a
pile
of
wood
that
had
been
left
behind
ross
snatched
a
small
twig
poking
it
at
the
coal
after
he
had
rubbed
it
into
a
brush
on
the
rough
rock
he
watched
all
one
ache
of
hope
the
twig
caught
with
his
stiff
fingers
so
clumsy
he
had
to
be
very
careful
but
ross
had
learned
patience
in
a
hard
school
bit
by
bit
he
fed
that
tiny
blaze
until
he
had
a
real
fire
then
leaning
back
against
the
rock
he
watched
it
it
was
now
obvious
that
the
placement
of
the
original
fire
had
been
chosen
with
care
for
the
outcrops
gave
it
wind
shelter
they
also
provided
a
dark
backdrop
partially
hiding
the
flames
on
the
landward
side
but
undoubtedly
making
them
more
visible
from
the
sea
the
site
seemed
just
right
for
a
signal
fire
but
to
what
ross
hands
shook
slightly
as
he
fed
the
blaze
it
was
only
too
clear
why
anyone
would
make
a
signal
on
this
shore
mcneil
or
perhaps
both
he
and
ashe
had
survived
the
breakup
of
the
raft
after
all
they
had
reached
this
point
abandoned
no
earlier
than
this
morning
judging
by
the
life
remaining
in
the
coals
and
put
up
the
signal
then
just
as
arranged
they
had
been
collected
by
the
sub
by
now
on
its
way
back
to
the
hidden
north
american
post
there
was
no
hope
of
any
pickup
for
him
now
just
as
he
had
believed
them
dead
after
he
had
found
that
rag
on
the
sapling
so
they
must
have
thought
him
finished
after
his
fall
in
the
river
he
was
just
a
few
hours
too
late
ross
folded
his
arms
across
his
hunched
knees
and
rested
his
head
on
them
there
was
no
possible
way
he
could
ever
reach
the
post
or
his
own
kind
ever
again
thousands
of
miles
lay
between
him
and
the
temporary
installation
in
this
time
he
was
so
sunk
in
his
own
complete
despair
that
he
was
long
unaware
of
finally
being
free
of
the
pressure
to
turn
back
which
had
so
long
haunted
him
but
as
he
roused
to
feed
the
fire
he
got
to
wondering
had
those
who
hunted
him
given
up
the
chase
since
he
had
lost
his
own
race
with
time
he
did
not
really
care
what
did
it
matter
the
pile
of
wood
was
getting
low
but
he
decided
that
did
not
matter
either
even
so
ross
got
to
his
feet
moving
over
to
the
drifts
of
storm
wrack
to
gather
more
why
should
he
stay
here
by
a
useless
beacon
but
somehow
he
could
not
force
himself
to
move
on
as
futile
as
his
vigil
seemed
dragging
the
bleached
limbs
of
trees
to
his
half
shelter
he
piled
them
up
working
until
he
laughed
at
the
barricade
he
had
built
a
siege
for
the
first
time
in
days
he
spoke
aloud
i
might
be
ready
for
a
siege
he
pulled
over
another
branch
added
it
to
his
pile
and
kneeled
down
once
more
by
the
flames
there
were
fisherfolk
to
be
found
along
this
coast
and
tomorrow
when
he
was
rested
he
would
strike
south
and
try
to
find
one
of
their
primitive
villages
traders
would
be
coming
into
this
territory
now
that
the
raiders
were
gone
if
he
could
contact
them
but
that
spark
of
interest
in
the
future
died
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
born
to
be
a
beaker
trader
as
an
agent
for
the
project
was
one
thing
to
live
the
role
for
the
rest
of
his
life
was
something
else
ross
stood
by
his
fire
staring
out
to
sea
for
a
sign
he
knew
he
would
never
see
again
as
long
as
he
lived
then
as
if
a
spear
had
struck
between
his
shoulder
blades
he
was
attacked
the
blow
was
not
physical
but
came
instead
as
a
tearing
red
pain
in
his
head
a
pressure
so
terrible
he
could
not
move
he
knew
instantly
that
behind
him
now
lurked
the
ultimate
danger
chapter
ross
fought
to
break
that
hold
to
turn
his
head
to
face
the
peril
which
crept
upon
him
now
unlike
anything
he
had
ever
met
before
in
his
short
lifetime
it
could
only
have
come
from
some
alien
source
this
strange
encounter
was
a
battle
of
will
against
will
the
same
rebellion
against
authority
which
had
ruled
his
boyhood
which
had
pushed
him
into
the
orbit
of
the
project
stiffened
him
to
meet
this
attack
he
was
going
to
turn
his
head
he
was
going
to
see
who
stood
there
he
inch
by
inch
ross
head
came
around
though
sweat
stung
his
seared
and
bitten
flesh
and
every
breath
was
an
effort
he
caught
a
half
glimpse
of
the
beach
behind
the
rocks
and
the
stretch
of
sand
was
empty
overhead
the
birds
were
gone
as
if
they
had
never
existed
or
as
if
they
had
been
swept
away
by
some
impatient
fighter
who
wanted
no
distractions
from
the
purpose
at
hand
having
successfully
turned
his
head
ross
decided
to
turn
his
body
his
left
hand
went
out
slowly
as
if
it
moved
some
great
weight
his
palm
gritted
painfully
on
the
rock
and
he
savored
that
pain
for
it
pierced
through
the
dead
blanket
of
compulsion
that
was
being
used
against
him
deliberately
he
ground
his
blistered
skin
against
the
stone
concentrating
on
the
sharp
torment
in
his
hand
as
the
agony
shot
up
his
arm
while
he
focused
his
attention
on
the
physical
pain
he
could
feel
the
pressure
against
him
weaken
summoning
all
his
strength
ross
swung
around
in
a
movement
which
was
only
a
shadow
of
his
former
feline
grace
the
beach
was
still
empty
except
for
the
piles
of
driftwood
the
rocks
and
the
other
things
he
had
originally
found
there
yet
he
knew
that
something
was
waiting
to
pounce
having
discovered
that
for
him
pain
was
a
defense
weapon
he
had
that
one
resource
if
they
took
him
it
would
be
after
besting
him
in
a
fight
even
as
he
made
this
decision
ross
was
conscious
of
a
curious
weakening
of
the
force
bent
upon
him
it
was
as
if
his
opponents
had
been
surprised
either
at
his
simple
actions
of
the
past
few
seconds
or
at
his
determination
ross
leaped
upon
that
surprise
adding
it
to
his
stock
of
unseen
weapons
he
leaned
forward
still
grinding
his
torn
hand
against
the
rock
as
a
steadying
influence
took
up
a
length
of
dried
wood
and
thrust
its
end
into
the
fire
having
once
used
fire
to
save
himself
he
was
ready
and
willing
to
do
it
again
although
at
the
same
time
another
part
of
him
shrank
from
what
he
intended
holding
his
improvised
torch
ross
stared
across
it
searching
the
land
for
the
faintest
sign
of
his
enemies
in
spite
of
the
fire
and
the
light
he
held
before
him
the
dusk
prevented
him
from
seeing
too
far
behind
him
the
crash
of
the
surf
could
have
covered
the
noise
of
a
marching
army
come
and
get
me
he
whirled
his
brand
into
bursting
life
and
then
hurled
it
straight
into
the
drift
among
the
dunes
he
was
grabbing
for
a
second
brand
almost
before
the
blazing
head
of
the
first
had
fallen
into
the
twisted
bleached
roots
of
a
dead
tree
he
stood
tense
a
second
torch
now
kindled
in
his
hand
the
sharp
vise
of
another
will
which
had
nipped
him
so
tightly
a
moment
ago
was
easing
slowly
disappearing
as
water
might
trickle
away
yet
he
could
not
believe
that
this
small
act
of
defiance
had
so
daunted
his
unseen
opponent
as
to
make
him
give
up
the
struggle
this
easily
it
was
more
likely
the
pause
of
a
wrestler
seeking
for
a
deadlier
grip
the
brand
in
his
hand
ross
second
line
of
defense
was
a
weapon
he
was
loath
to
use
but
would
use
if
he
were
forced
to
it
he
kept
his
hand
mercilessly
flat
against
the
rock
as
a
reminder
and
a
spur
fire
twisted
and
crackled
among
the
driftwood
where
the
first
torch
had
lodged
providing
a
flickering
light
yards
from
where
he
stood
he
was
grateful
for
it
in
the
gloom
of
the
gathering
storm
if
they
would
only
come
to
open
war
before
the
rain
struck
ross
sheltered
his
torch
with
his
body
as
spray
driven
inward
from
the
sea
spattered
his
shoulders
and
his
back
if
it
rained
he
would
lose
what
small
advantage
the
fire
gave
him
but
then
he
would
find
some
other
way
to
meet
them
they
would
neither
break
him
nor
take
him
even
if
he
had
to
wade
into
the
sea
and
swim
out
into
the
lash
of
the
cold
northern
waves
until
he
could
not
move
his
tired
limbs
any
longer
once
again
that
will
struck
at
ross
probing
his
stubbornness
assaulting
his
mind
he
whirled
the
torch
brought
the
scorching
breath
of
the
flame
across
the
hand
resting
on
the
rock
unable
to
control
his
own
cry
of
protest
he
was
not
sure
he
had
the
fortitude
to
repeat
such
an
act
he
had
won
again
the
pressure
had
fallen
away
in
a
flick
almost
as
if
some
current
had
been
snapped
off
through
the
red
curtain
of
his
torment
ross
sensed
a
surprise
and
disbelief
he
was
unaware
that
in
this
queer
duel
he
was
using
both
a
power
of
will
and
a
depth
of
perception
he
had
never
known
he
possessed
because
of
his
daring
he
had
shaken
his
opponents
as
no
physical
attack
could
have
affected
them
come
and
get
me
he
shouted
again
at
the
barren
shoreline
where
the
fire
ate
at
the
drift
and
nothing
stirred
yet
something
very
much
alive
and
conscious
lay
hidden
this
time
there
was
more
than
simple
challenge
in
ross
demand
there
was
a
note
of
triumph
the
spray
whipped
by
him
striking
at
his
fire
at
the
brand
he
held
let
the
sea
water
put
both
out
he
would
find
another
way
of
fighting
he
was
certain
of
that
and
he
sensed
that
those
out
there
knew
it
too
and
were
troubled
the
fire
was
being
driven
by
the
wind
along
the
crisscross
lines
of
wood
left
high
on
the
beach
forming
a
wall
of
flame
between
him
and
the
interior
not
however
an
insurmountable
barrier
to
whatever
lurked
there
again
ross
leaned
against
the
rock
studying
the
length
of
beach
had
he
been
wrong
in
thinking
that
they
were
within
the
range
of
his
voice
the
power
they
had
used
might
carry
over
a
greater
distance
yahhhh
instead
of
a
demand
he
now
voiced
a
taunting
cry
screaming
his
defiance
some
wild
madness
had
been
transmitted
to
him
by
the
winds
the
roaring
sea
his
own
pain
ready
to
face
the
worst
they
could
send
against
him
he
tried
to
hurl
that
thought
back
at
them
as
they
had
struck
with
their
united
will
at
him
no
answer
came
to
his
challenge
no
rise
to
moving
away
from
the
rock
ross
began
to
walk
forward
toward
the
burning
drift
his
torch
ready
in
his
hand
i
am
here
he
shouted
into
the
wind
come
out
face
me
it
was
then
that
he
saw
those
who
had
tracked
him
two
tall
thin
figures
wearing
dark
clothes
were
standing
quietly
watching
him
their
eyes
dark
holes
in
the
white
ovals
of
their
faces
ross
halted
though
they
were
separated
by
yards
of
sand
and
rock
and
a
burning
barrier
he
could
feel
the
force
they
wielded
the
nature
of
that
force
had
changed
however
once
it
had
struck
with
a
vigorous
spear
point
now
it
formed
a
shield
of
protection
ross
could
not
break
through
that
shield
and
they
dared
not
drop
it
a
stalemate
existed
between
them
in
this
strange
battle
the
like
of
which
ross
world
had
not
known
before
he
watched
those
expressionless
white
faces
trying
to
find
some
reply
to
the
deadlock
there
flashed
into
his
mind
the
certainty
that
while
he
lived
and
moved
and
they
lived
and
moved
this
struggle
this
unending
pursuit
would
continue
for
some
mysterious
reason
they
wanted
to
have
him
under
their
control
but
that
was
never
going
to
happen
if
they
all
had
to
remain
here
on
this
strip
of
sand
until
they
starved
to
death
ross
tried
to
drive
that
thought
across
to
them
murrrrdock
that
croaking
cry
borne
out
of
the
sea
by
the
wind
might
almost
have
come
from
the
bill
of
a
sea
bird
murrrrdock
ross
spun
around
visibility
had
been
drastically
curtailed
by
the
lowering
clouds
and
the
dashing
spray
but
he
could
see
a
round
dark
thing
bobbing
on
the
waves
the
sub
a
raft
sensing
a
movement
behind
him
ross
wheeled
about
as
one
of
the
alien
figures
leaped
the
blazing
drift
heedless
of
the
flames
and
ran
toward
him
in
what
could
only
be
an
attempt
at
capture
the
man
had
ready
a
weapon
like
the
one
that
had
felled
foscar
ross
threw
himself
at
his
opponent
in
a
reckless
dive
falling
on
him
with
a
smashing
impact
in
ross
grasp
the
alien
body
was
fragile
but
he
moved
fluidly
as
murdock
fought
to
break
his
grip
on
the
hand
weapon
and
pin
him
to
the
sand
ross
was
too
intent
upon
his
own
part
of
the
struggle
to
heed
the
sounds
of
a
shot
over
his
head
and
a
thin
wailing
cry
he
slammed
his
opponent
hand
against
a
stone
and
the
white
face
inches
away
from
his
own
twisted
silently
with
pain
fumbling
for
a
better
hold
ross
was
sent
rolling
he
came
down
on
his
left
hand
with
a
force
which
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
and
stopped
him
just
long
enough
for
the
other
to
regain
his
feet
the
man
sprinted
back
to
the
body
of
his
fellow
where
it
lay
by
the
drift
he
slung
his
unconscious
comrade
over
the
barrier
with
more
ease
than
ross
would
have
believed
possible
and
vaulted
the
barrier
after
him
ross
half
crouched
on
the
sand
felt
unusually
light
and
empty
the
strange
tie
which
had
drawn
and
held
him
to
the
strangers
had
been
broken
murdock
a
rubber
raft
rode
in
on
the
waves
two
men
aboard
it
ross
got
up
pulling
at
the
studs
of
his
suit
with
his
right
hand
he
could
believe
in
what
he
saw
now
the
sub
had
not
left
after
all
the
two
men
running
toward
him
through
the
dusk
were
of
his
own
kind
murdock
it
did
not
seem
at
all
strange
that
kelgarries
reached
him
first
ross
caught
up
in
this
dream
appealed
to
the
major
for
aid
with
the
studs
if
the
strangers
from
the
ship
did
trace
him
by
the
suit
they
were
not
going
to
follow
the
sub
back
to
the
post
and
serve
the
project
as
they
had
the
reds
got
to
get
this
off
he
pulled
the
words
out
one
by
one
tugging
frantically
at
the
stubborn
studs
they
can
trace
this
and
follow
us
kelgarries
needed
no
better
explanation
ripping
loose
the
fastenings
he
pulled
the
clinging
fabric
from
ross
sending
him
reeling
with
pain
as
he
pulled
the
left
sleeve
down
the
younger
man
arm
the
wind
and
spray
were
ice
on
his
body
as
they
dragged
him
down
to
the
raft
bundling
him
aboard
he
did
not
at
all
remember
their
arrival
on
board
the
sub
he
was
lying
in
the
vibrating
heart
of
the
undersea
ship
when
he
opened
his
eyes
to
see
kelgarries
regarding
him
intently
ashe
a
coat
of
bandage
about
his
shoulder
and
chest
lay
on
a
neighboring
bunk
mcneil
stood
watching
a
medical
corpsman
lay
out
supplies
he
needs
a
shot
the
medic
was
saying
as
ross
blinked
at
the
major
you
left
the
suit
back
there
ross
demanded
we
did
what
this
about
them
tracing
you
by
it
who
was
tracing
you
men
from
the
space
ship
that
the
only
way
they
could
have
trailed
me
down
the
river
he
was
finding
it
difficult
to
talk
and
the
protesting
medic
kept
waving
a
needle
in
his
direction
but
somehow
in
bursts
of
sentences
ross
got
out
his
story
foscar
death
his
own
escape
from
the
chief
funeral
pyre
and
the
weird
duel
of
wills
back
on
the
beach
even
as
he
poured
it
out
he
thought
how
unlikely
most
of
it
must
sound
yet
kelgarries
appeared
to
accept
every
word
and
there
was
no
expression
of
disbelief
on
ashe
face
so
that
how
you
got
those
burns
said
the
major
slowly
when
ross
had
finished
his
story
deliberately
searing
your
hand
in
the
fire
to
break
their
hold
he
crashed
his
fist
against
the
wall
of
the
tiny
cabin
and
then
when
ross
winced
at
the
jar
he
hurriedly
uncurled
those
fingers
to
press
ross
shoulder
with
a
surprisingly
warm
and
gentle
touch
put
him
to
sleep
he
ordered
the
medic
he
deserves
about
a
month
of
it
i
should
judge
i
think
he
has
brought
us
a
bigger
slice
of
the
future
than
we
had
hoped
for
ross
felt
the
prick
of
the
needle
and
then
nothing
more
even
when
he
was
carried
ashore
at
the
post
and
later
when
he
was
transported
into
his
proper
time
he
did
not
awaken
he
only
approached
a
strange
dreamy
state
in
which
he
ate
and
drowsed
not
caring
for
the
world
beyond
his
own
bunk
but
there
came
a
day
when
he
did
care
sitting
up
to
demand
food
with
a
great
deal
of
his
old
the
doctor
looked
him
over
permitting
him
to
get
out
of
bed
and
try
out
his
legs
they
were
exceedingly
uncooperative
at
first
and
ross
was
glad
he
had
tried
to
move
only
from
his
bunk
to
a
waiting
chair
visitors
welcome
ross
looked
up
eagerly
and
then
smiled
somewhat
hesitatingly
at
ashe
the
older
man
wore
his
arm
in
a
sling
but
otherwise
seemed
his
usual
imperturbable
self
ashe
tell
me
what
happened
are
we
back
at
the
main
base
what
about
the
reds
we
were
traced
by
the
ship
people
were
we
ashe
laughed
did
doc
just
wind
you
up
to
let
you
spin
ross
yes
this
is
home
sweet
home
as
for
the
rest
well
it
is
a
long
story
and
we
are
still
picking
up
pieces
of
it
here
and
there
ross
pointed
to
the
bunk
in
invitation
can
you
tell
me
what
is
known
he
was
still
somewhat
at
a
loss
his
old
secret
awe
of
ashe
tempering
his
outward
show
of
eagerness
ross
still
feared
one
of
those
snubs
the
other
so
well
knew
how
to
deliver
to
the
bumptious
but
ashe
did
come
in
and
sit
down
none
of
his
old
formality
now
in
evidence
you
have
been
a
surprise
package
murdock
his
observation
had
some
of
the
ring
of
the
old
ashe
but
there
was
no
withdrawal
behind
the
words
rather
a
busy
lad
were
you
after
you
were
bumped
off
into
that
river
ross
reply
was
a
grimace
you
heard
all
about
that
he
had
no
time
for
his
own
adventures
already
receding
into
a
past
which
made
them
both
dim
and
unimportant
what
happened
to
you
and
to
the
project
and
one
thing
at
a
time
and
do
rush
your
fences
ashe
was
surveying
him
with
an
odd
intentness
which
ross
could
not
understand
he
continued
to
explain
in
his
instructor
voice
we
made
it
down
the
river
how
do
ask
me
that
was
something
of
a
in
itself
he
laughed
the
raft
came
apart
piece
by
piece
and
we
waded
most
of
the
last
couple
of
miles
i
think
i
none
too
clear
on
the
details
you
have
to
get
those
out
of
mcneil
who
was
still
among
those
present
then
other
than
that
we
can
not
compete
with
your
adventures
we
built
a
signal
fire
and
sat
by
it
toasting
our
shins
for
a
few
days
until
the
sub
came
to
collect
us
and
took
you
off
ross
experienced
a
fleeting
return
of
that
hollow
feeling
he
had
known
on
the
shore
when
the
coals
of
the
signal
fire
had
told
him
the
story
of
his
arrival
and
took
us
off
but
kelgarries
agreed
to
spin
out
our
waiting
period
for
another
hours
in
case
you
did
manage
to
survive
that
toss
you
took
into
the
river
then
we
sighted
your
spectacular
display
of
fireworks
on
the
beach
and
the
rest
was
easy
the
ship
people
did
trace
us
back
to
post
not
that
we
know
of
anyway
we
closed
down
the
post
on
that
time
level
you
might
be
interested
in
a
very
peculiar
tale
our
modern
agents
have
picked
up
floating
over
and
under
the
iron
curtain
a
blast
went
off
in
the
baltic
region
of
this
time
wiping
some
installation
clean
off
the
map
the
reds
have
kept
quiet
as
to
the
nature
of
the
explosion
and
the
exact
place
where
it
occurred
the
aliens
followed
all
the
way
up
to
this
time
ross
half
rose
from
the
chair
but
why
and
why
did
they
trail
me
that
we
can
only
guess
but
i
do
believe
that
they
were
moved
by
any
private
vengeance
for
the
looting
of
their
derelict
there
is
some
more
imperative
reason
why
they
do
want
us
to
find
or
use
anything
from
one
of
their
cargoes
but
they
were
in
power
thousands
of
years
ago
maybe
they
and
their
worlds
are
gone
now
why
should
things
we
do
today
matter
to
them
well
it
does
matter
and
in
some
very
important
way
and
we
have
to
learn
that
reason
how
ross
looked
down
at
his
left
hand
encased
in
a
mitten
of
bandage
under
which
he
very
gingerly
tried
to
stretch
a
finger
maybe
he
should
have
been
eager
to
welcome
another
meeting
with
the
ship
people
but
if
he
were
truly
honest
he
had
to
admit
that
he
did
not
he
glanced
up
sure
that
ashe
had
read
all
that
hesitation
and
scorned
him
for
it
but
there
was
no
sign
that
his
discomfiture
had
been
noticed
by
doing
some
looting
of
our
own
ashe
answered
those
tapes
we
brought
back
are
going
to
be
a
big
help
more
than
one
derelict
was
located
we
were
right
in
our
surmise
that
the
reds
first
discovered
the
remains
of
one
in
siberia
but
it
was
in
no
condition
to
be
explored
they
already
had
the
basic
idea
of
the
time
traveler
so
they
applied
it
to
the
hunting
down
of
other
ships
with
several
way
stops
to
throw
people
like
us
off
the
scent
so
they
found
an
intact
ship
and
also
several
others
at
least
three
are
on
side
of
the
atlantic
where
they
could
get
at
them
very
well
those
we
can
deal
with
now
wo
the
aliens
be
waiting
for
us
to
try
that
as
far
as
we
can
discover
they
do
know
where
any
of
these
ships
crashed
either
there
were
no
survivors
or
passengers
and
crew
took
off
in
lifeboats
while
they
were
still
in
space
they
might
never
have
known
of
the
reds
activities
if
you
had
triggered
that
communicator
on
the
derelict
ross
was
reduced
to
a
small
boy
who
badly
needed
an
alibi
for
some
piece
of
juvenile
mischief
i
did
mean
to
that
excuse
sounded
so
feeble
that
he
was
surprised
into
a
laugh
only
to
see
ashe
grinning
back
at
him
seeing
as
how
your
action
also
put
a
very
effective
spike
in
the
opposition
wheel
you
are
freely
forgiven
anyway
you
have
also
provided
us
with
a
pretty
good
idea
of
what
we
may
be
up
against
with
the
aliens
and
we
be
prepared
for
that
next
time
then
there
will
be
a
next
time
we
are
calling
in
all
time
agents
concentrating
our
forces
in
the
right
period
yes
there
will
be
a
next
time
we
have
to
learn
just
what
they
are
trying
so
hard
to
protect
what
do
you
think
it
is
space
ashe
spoke
the
word
softly
as
if
he
relished
the
promise
it
held
space
that
ship
you
explored
was
a
derelict
from
a
galactic
fleet
but
it
was
a
ship
and
it
used
the
principle
of
space
flight
do
you
understand
now
in
these
lost
ships
lies
the
secret
which
will
make
us
free
of
all
the
stars
we
must
claim
it
can
we
can
ashe
was
laughing
at
ross
again
with
his
eyes
though
his
face
remained
sober
then
still
want
to
be
counted
in
on
this
game
ross
looked
down
again
at
his
bandaged
hand
and
remembered
swiftly
so
many
things
the
coast
of
britain
on
a
misty
morning
the
excitement
of
prowling
the
alien
ship
the
fight
with
ennar
even
the
long
nightmare
of
his
flight
down
the
river
and
lastly
the
exultation
he
had
tasted
when
he
had
faced
the
alien
and
had
locked
wills
to
hold
steady
he
knew
that
he
could
not
would
not
give
up
what
he
had
found
here
in
the
service
of
the
project
as
long
as
it
was
in
his
power
to
cling
to
it
yes
it
was
a
very
simple
answer
but
when
his
eyes
met
ashe
ross
knew
that
it
would
serve
better
than
any
solemn
oath
second

if
it
is

perhaps
it
is
also
possible

the
theory
american

were
exploring
in

effort

the
