preface
to
shakespeare
that
praises
are
without
reason
lavished
on
the
dead
and
that
the
honours
due
only
to
excellence
are
paid
to
antiquity
is
a
complaint
likely
to
be
always
continued
by
those
who
being
able
to
add
nothing
to
truth
hope
for
eminence
from
the
heresies
of
paradox
or
those
who
being
forced
by
disappointment
upon
consolatory
expedients
are
willing
to
hope
from
posterity
what
the
present
age
refuses
and
flatter
themselves
that
the
regard
which
is
yet
denied
by
envy
will
be
at
last
bestowed
by
time
antiquity
like
every
other
quality
that
attracts
the
notice
of
mankind
has
undoubtedly
votaries
that
reverence
it
not
from
reason
but
from
prejudice
some
seem
to
admire
indiscriminately
whatever
has
been
long
preserved
without
considering
that
time
has
sometimes
with
chance
all
perhaps
are
more
willing
to
honour
past
than
present
excellence
and
the
mind
contemplates
genius
through
the
shades
of
age
as
the
eye
surveys
the
sun
through
artificial
opacity
the
great
contention
of
criticism
is
to
find
the
faults
of
the
moderns
and
the
beauties
of
the
ancients
while
an
authour
is
yet
living
we
estimate
his
powers
by
his
worst
performance
and
when
he
is
dead
we
rate
them
by
his
best
to
works
however
of
which
the
excellence
is
not
absolute
and
definite
but
gradual
and
comparative
to
works
not
raised
upon
principles
demonstrative
and
scientifick
but
appealing
wholly
to
observation
and
experience
no
other
test
can
be
applied
than
length
of
duration
and
continuance
of
esteem
what
mankind
have
long
possessed
they
have
often
examined
and
compared
and
if
they
persist
to
value
the
possession
it
is
because
frequent
comparisons
have
confirmed
opinion
in
its
favour
as
among
the
works
of
nature
no
man
can
properly
call
a
river
deep
or
a
mountain
high
without
the
knowledge
of
many
mountains
and
many
rivers
so
in
the
productions
of
genius
nothing
can
be
stiled
excellent
till
it
has
been
compared
with
other
works
of
the
same
kind
demonstration
immediately
displays
its
power
and
has
nothing
to
hope
or
fear
from
the
flux
of
years
but
works
tentative
and
experimental
must
be
estimated
by
their
proportion
to
the
general
and
collective
ability
of
man
as
it
is
discovered
in
a
long
succession
of
endeavours
of
the
first
building
that
was
raised
it
might
be
with
certainty
determined
that
it
was
round
or
square
but
whether
it
was
spacious
or
lofty
must
have
been
referred
to
time
the
pythagorean
scale
of
numbers
was
at
once
discovered
to
be
perfect
but
the
poems
of
homer
we
yet
know
not
to
transcend
the
common
limits
of
human
intelligence
but
by
remarking
that
nation
after
nation
and
century
after
century
has
been
able
to
do
little
more
than
transpose
his
incidents
new
name
his
characters
and
paraphrase
his
sentiments
the
reverence
due
to
writings
that
have
long
subsisted
arises
therefore
not
from
any
credulous
confidence
in
the
superior
wisdom
of
past
ages
or
gloomy
persuasion
of
the
degeneracy
of
mankind
but
is
the
consequence
of
acknowledged
and
indubitable
positions
that
what
has
been
longest
known
has
been
most
considered
and
what
is
most
considered
is
best
understood
the
poet
of
whose
works
i
have
undertaken
the
revision
may
now
begin
to
assume
the
dignity
of
an
ancient
and
claim
the
privilege
of
established
fame
and
prescriptive
veneration
he
has
long
outlived
his
century
the
term
commonly
fixed
as
the
test
of
literary
merit
whatever
advantages
he
might
once
derive
from
personal
allusions
local
customs
or
temporary
opinions
have
for
many
years
been
lost
and
every
topick
of
merriment
or
motive
of
sorrow
which
the
modes
of
artificial
life
afforded
him
now
only
obscure
the
scenes
which
they
once
illuminated
the
effects
of
favour
and
competition
are
at
an
end
the
tradition
of
his
friendships
and
his
enmities
has
perished
his
works
support
no
opinion
with
arguments
nor
supply
any
faction
with
invectives
they
can
neither
indulge
vanity
nor
gratify
malignity
but
are
read
without
any
other
reason
than
the
desire
of
pleasure
and
are
therefore
praised
only
as
pleasure
is
obtained
yet
thus
unassisted
by
interest
or
passion
they
have
past
through
variations
of
taste
and
changes
of
manners
and
as
they
devolved
from
one
generation
to
another
have
received
new
honours
at
every
transmission
but
because
human
judgment
though
it
be
gradually
gaining
upon
certainty
never
becomes
infallible
and
approbation
though
long
continued
may
yet
be
only
the
approbation
of
prejudice
or
fashion
it
is
proper
to
inquire
by
what
peculiarities
of
excellence
shakespeare
has
gained
and
kept
the
favour
of
his
countrymen
nothing
can
please
many
and
please
long
but
just
representations
of
general
nature
particular
manners
can
be
known
to
few
and
therefore
few
only
can
judge
how
nearly
they
are
copied
the
irregular
combinations
of
fanciful
invention
may
delight
by
that
novelty
of
which
the
common
satiety
of
life
sends
us
all
in
quest
but
the
pleasures
of
sudden
wonder
are
soon
exhausted
and
the
mind
can
only
repose
on
the
stability
of
truth
shakespeare
is
above
all
writers
at
least
above
all
modern
writers
the
poet
of
nature
the
poet
that
holds
up
to
his
readers
a
faithful
mirrour
of
manners
and
of
life
his
characters
are
not
modified
by
the
customs
of
particular
places
unpractised
by
the
rest
of
the
world
by
the
peculiarities
of
studies
or
professions
which
can
operate
but
upon
small
numbers
or
by
the
accidents
of
transient
fashions
or
temporary
opinions
they
are
the
genuine
progeny
of
common
humanity
such
as
the
world
will
always
supply
and
observation
will
always
find
his
persons
act
and
speak
by
the
influence
of
those
general
passions
and
principles
by
which
all
minds
are
agitated
and
the
whole
system
of
life
is
continued
in
motion
in
the
writings
of
other
poets
a
character
is
too
often
an
individual
in
those
of
shakespeare
it
is
commonly
a
species
it
is
from
this
wide
extension
of
design
that
so
much
instruction
is
derived
it
is
this
which
fills
the
plays
of
shakespeare
with
practical
axioms
and
domestick
wisdom
it
was
said
of
euripides
that
every
verse
was
a
precept
and
it
may
be
said
of
shakespeare
that
from
his
works
may
be
collected
a
system
of
civil
and
oeconomical
prudence
yet
his
real
power
is
not
shown
in
the
splendour
of
particular
passages
but
by
the
progress
of
his
fable
and
the
tenour
of
his
dialogue
and
he
that
tries
to
recommend
him
by
select
quotations
will
succeed
like
the
pedant
in
hierocles
who
when
he
offered
his
house
to
sale
carried
a
brick
in
his
pocket
as
a
specimen
it
will
not
easily
be
imagined
how
much
shakespeare
excells
in
accommodating
his
sentiments
to
real
life
but
by
comparing
him
with
other
authours
it
was
observed
of
the
ancient
schools
of
declamation
that
the
more
diligently
they
were
frequented
the
more
was
the
student
disqualified
for
the
world
because
he
found
nothing
there
which
he
should
ever
meet
in
any
other
place
the
same
remark
may
be
applied
to
every
stage
but
that
of
shakespeare
the
theatre
when
it
is
under
any
other
direction
is
peopled
by
such
characters
as
were
never
seen
conversing
in
a
language
which
was
never
heard
upon
topicks
which
will
never
arise
in
the
commerce
of
mankind
but
the
dialogue
of
this
authour
is
often
so
evidently
determined
by
the
incident
which
produces
it
and
is
pursued
with
so
much
ease
and
simplicity
that
it
seems
scarcely
to
claim
the
merit
of
fiction
but
to
have
been
gleaned
by
diligent
selection
out
of
common
conversation
and
common
occurrences
upon
every
other
stage
the
universal
agent
is
love
by
whose
power
all
good
and
evil
is
distributed
and
every
action
quickened
or
retarded
to
bring
a
lover
a
lady
and
a
rival
into
the
fable
to
entangle
them
in
contradictory
obligations
perplex
them
with
oppositions
of
interest
and
harrass
them
with
violence
of
desires
inconsistent
with
each
other
to
make
them
meet
in
rapture
and
part
in
agony
to
fill
their
mouths
with
hyperbolical
joy
and
outrageous
sorrow
to
distress
them
as
nothing
human
ever
was
distressed
to
deliver
them
as
nothing
human
ever
was
delivered
is
the
business
of
a
modern
dramatist
for
this
probability
is
violated
life
is
misrepresented
and
language
is
depraved
but
love
is
only
one
of
many
passions
and
as
it
has
no
great
influence
upon
the
sum
of
life
it
has
little
operation
in
the
dramas
of
a
poet
who
caught
his
ideas
from
the
living
world
and
exhibited
only
what
he
saw
before
him
he
knew
that
any
other
passion
as
it
was
regular
or
exorbitant
was
a
cause
of
happiness
or
calamity
characters
thus
ample
and
general
were
not
easily
discriminated
and
preserved
yet
perhaps
no
poet
ever
kept
his
personages
more
distinct
from
each
other
i
will
not
say
with
pope
that
every
speech
may
be
assigned
to
the
proper
speaker
because
many
speeches
there
are
which
have
nothing
characteristical
but
perhaps
though
some
may
be
equally
adapted
to
every
person
it
will
be
difficult
to
find
any
that
can
be
properly
transferred
from
the
present
possessor
to
another
claimant
the
choice
is
right
when
there
is
reason
for
choice
other
dramatists
can
only
gain
attention
by
hyperbolical
or
aggravated
characters
by
fabulous
and
unexampled
excellence
or
depravity
as
the
writers
of
barbarous
romances
invigorated
the
reader
by
a
giant
and
a
dwarf
and
he
that
should
form
his
expectations
of
human
affairs
from
the
play
or
from
the
tale
would
be
equally
deceived
shakespeare
has
no
heroes
his
scenes
are
occupied
only
by
men
who
act
and
speak
as
the
reader
thinks
that
he
should
himself
have
spoken
or
acted
on
the
same
occasion
even
where
the
agency
is
supernatural
the
dialogue
is
level
with
life
other
writers
disguise
the
most
natural
passions
and
most
frequent
incidents
so
that
he
who
contemplates
them
in
the
book
will
not
know
them
in
the
world
shakespeare
approximates
the
remote
and
familiarizes
the
wonderful
the
event
which
he
represents
will
not
happen
but
if
it
were
possible
its
effects
would
be
probably
such
as
he
has
assigned
and
it
may
be
said
that
he
has
not
only
shewn
human
nature
as
it
acts
in
real
exigences
but
as
it
would
be
found
in
trials
to
which
it
can
not
be
exposed
this
therefore
is
the
praise
of
shakespeare
that
his
drama
is
the
mirrour
of
life
that
he
who
has
mazed
his
imagination
in
following
the
phantoms
which
other
writers
raise
up
before
him
may
here
be
cured
of
his
delirious
extasies
by
reading
human
sentiments
in
human
language
by
scenes
from
which
a
hermit
may
estimate
the
transactions
of
the
world
and
a
confessor
predict
the
progress
of
the
passions
his
adherence
to
general
nature
has
exposed
him
to
the
censure
of
criticks
who
form
their
judgments
upon
narrower
principles
dennis
and
rhymer
think
his
romans
not
sufficiently
roman
and
voltaire
censures
his
kings
as
not
completely
royal
dennis
is
offended
that
menenius
a
senator
of
rome
should
play
the
buffoon
and
voltaire
perhaps
thinks
decency
violated
when
the
danish
usurper
is
represented
as
a
drunkard
but
shakespeare
always
makes
nature
predominate
over
accident
and
if
he
preserves
the
essential
character
is
not
very
careful
of
distinctions
superinduced
and
adventitious
his
story
requires
romans
or
kings
but
he
thinks
only
on
men
he
knew
that
rome
like
every
other
city
had
men
of
all
dispositions
and
wanting
a
buffoon
he
went
into
the
for
that
which
the
would
certainly
have
afforded
him
he
was
inclined
to
shew
an
usurper
and
a
murderer
not
only
odious
but
despicable
he
therefore
added
drunkenness
to
his
other
qualities
knowing
that
kings
love
wine
like
other
men
and
that
wine
exerts
its
natural
power
upon
kings
these
are
the
petty
cavils
of
petty
minds
a
poet
overlooks
the
casual
distinction
of
country
and
condition
as
a
painter
satisfied
with
the
figure
neglects
the
drapery
the
censure
which
he
has
incurred
by
mixing
comick
and
tragick
scenes
as
it
extends
to
all
his
works
deserves
more
consideration
let
the
fact
be
first
stated
and
then
examined
shakespeare
plays
are
not
in
the
rigorous
and
critical
sense
either
tragedies
or
comedies
but
compositions
of
a
distinct
kind
exhibiting
the
real
state
of
sublunary
nature
which
partakes
of
good
and
evil
joy
and
sorrow
mingled
with
endless
variety
of
proportion
and
innumerable
modes
of
combination
and
expressing
the
course
of
the
world
in
which
the
loss
of
one
is
the
gain
of
another
in
which
at
the
same
time
the
reveller
is
hasting
to
his
wine
and
the
mourner
burying
his
friend
in
which
the
malignity
of
one
is
sometimes
defeated
by
the
frolick
of
another
and
many
mischiefs
and
many
benefits
are
done
and
hindered
without
design
out
of
this
chaos
of
mingled
purposes
and
casualties
the
ancient
poets
according
to
the
laws
which
custom
had
prescribed
selected
some
the
crimes
of
men
and
some
their
absurdities
some
the
momentous
vicissitudes
of
life
and
some
the
lighter
occurrences
some
the
terrours
of
distress
and
some
the
gayeties
of
prosperity
thus
rose
the
two
modes
of
imitation
known
by
the
names
of
tragedy
and
comedy
compositions
intended
to
promote
different
ends
by
contrary
means
and
considered
as
so
little
allied
that
i
do
not
recollect
among
the
greeks
or
romans
a
single
writer
who
attempted
both
shakespeare
has
united
the
powers
of
exciting
laughter
and
sorrow
not
only
in
one
mind
but
in
one
composition
almost
all
his
plays
are
divided
between
serious
and
ludicrous
characters
and
in
the
successive
evolutions
of
the
design
sometimes
produce
seriousness
and
sorrow
and
sometimes
levity
and
laughter
that
this
is
a
practice
contrary
to
the
rules
of
criticism
will
be
readily
allowed
but
there
is
always
an
appeal
open
from
criticism
to
nature
the
end
of
writing
is
to
instruct
the
end
of
poetry
is
to
instruct
by
pleasing
that
the
mingled
drama
may
convey
all
the
instruction
of
tragedy
or
comedy
can
not
be
denied
because
it
includes
both
in
its
alterations
of
exhibition
and
approaches
nearer
than
either
to
the
appearance
of
life
by
shewing
how
great
machinations
and
slender
designs
may
promote
or
obviate
one
another
and
the
high
and
the
low
in
the
general
system
by
unavoidable
concatenation
it
is
objected
that
by
this
change
of
scenes
the
passions
are
interrupted
in
their
progression
and
that
the
principal
event
being
not
advanced
by
a
due
gradation
of
preparatory
incidents
wants
at
last
the
power
to
move
which
constitutes
the
perfection
of
dramatick
poetry
this
reasoning
is
so
specious
that
it
is
received
as
true
even
by
those
who
in
daily
experience
feel
it
to
be
false
the
interchanges
of
mingled
scenes
seldom
fail
to
produce
the
intended
vicissitudes
of
passion
fiction
can
not
move
so
much
but
that
the
attention
may
be
easily
transferred
and
though
it
must
be
allowed
that
pleasing
melancholy
be
sometimes
interrupted
by
unwelcome
levity
yet
let
it
be
considered
likewise
that
melancholy
is
often
not
pleasing
and
that
the
disturbance
of
one
man
may
be
the
relief
of
another
that
different
auditors
have
different
habitudes
and
that
upon
the
whole
all
pleasure
consists
in
variety
the
players
who
in
their
edition
divided
our
authour
works
into
comedies
histories
and
tragedies
seem
not
to
have
distinguished
the
three
kinds
by
any
very
exact
or
definite
ideas
an
action
which
ended
happily
to
the
principal
persons
however
serious
or
distressful
through
its
intermediate
incidents
in
their
opinion
constituted
a
comedy
this
idea
of
a
comedy
continued
long
amongst
us
and
plays
were
written
which
by
changing
the
catastrophe
were
tragedies
and
comedies
tragedy
was
not
in
those
times
a
poem
of
more
general
dignity
or
elevation
than
comedy
it
required
only
a
calamitous
conclusion
with
which
the
common
criticism
of
that
age
was
satisfied
whatever
lighter
pleasure
it
afforded
in
its
progress
history
was
a
series
of
actions
with
no
other
than
chronological
succession
independent
of
each
other
and
without
any
tendency
to
introduce
or
regulate
the
conclusion
it
is
not
always
very
nicely
distinguished
from
tragedy
there
is
not
much
nearer
approach
to
unity
of
action
in
the
tragedy
of
antony
and
cleopatra
than
in
the
history
of
richard
the
second
but
a
history
might
be
continued
through
many
plays
as
it
had
no
plan
it
had
no
limits
through
all
these
denominations
of
the
drama
shakespeare
mode
of
composition
is
the
same
an
interchange
of
seriousness
and
merriment
by
which
the
mind
is
softened
at
one
time
and
exhilarated
at
another
but
whatever
be
his
purpose
whether
to
gladden
or
depress
or
to
conduct
the
story
without
vehemence
or
emotion
through
tracts
of
easy
and
familiar
dialogue
he
never
fails
to
attain
his
purpose
as
he
commands
us
we
laugh
or
mourn
or
sit
silent
with
quiet
expectation
in
tranquillity
without
indifference
when
shakespeare
plan
is
understood
most
of
the
criticisms
of
rhymer
and
voltaire
vanish
away
the
play
of
hamlet
is
opened
without
impropriety
by
two
sentinels
iago
bellows
at
window
without
injury
to
the
scheme
of
the
play
though
in
terms
which
a
modern
audience
would
not
easily
endure
the
character
of
polonius
is
seasonable
and
useful
and
the
themselves
may
be
heard
with
applause
shakespeare
engaged
in
dramatick
poetry
with
the
world
open
before
him
the
rules
of
the
ancients
were
yet
known
to
few
the
publick
judgment
was
unformed
he
had
no
example
of
such
fame
as
might
force
him
upon
imitation
nor
criticks
of
such
authority
as
might
restrain
his
extravagance
he
therefore
indulged
his
natural
disposition
and
his
disposition
as
rhymer
has
remarked
led
him
to
comedy
in
tragedy
he
often
writes
with
great
appearance
of
toil
and
study
what
is
written
at
last
with
little
felicity
but
in
his
comick
scenes
he
seems
to
produce
without
labour
what
no
labour
can
improve
in
tragedy
he
is
always
struggling
after
some
occasion
to
be
comick
but
in
comedy
he
seems
to
repose
or
to
luxuriate
as
in
a
mode
of
thinking
congenial
to
his
nature
in
his
tragick
scenes
there
is
always
something
wanting
but
his
comedy
often
surpasses
expectation
or
desire
his
comedy
pleases
by
the
thoughts
and
the
language
and
his
tragedy
for
the
greater
part
by
incident
and
action
his
tragedy
seems
to
be
skill
his
comedy
to
be
instinct
the
force
of
his
comick
scenes
has
suffered
little
diminution
from
the
changes
made
by
a
century
and
a
half
in
manners
or
in
words
as
his
personages
act
upon
principles
arising
from
genuine
passion
very
little
modified
by
particular
forms
their
pleasures
and
vexations
are
communicable
to
all
times
and
to
all
places
they
are
natural
and
therefore
durable
the
adventitious
peculiarities
of
personal
habits
are
only
superficial
dies
bright
and
pleasing
for
a
little
while
yet
soon
fading
to
a
dim
tinct
without
any
remains
of
former
lustre
but
the
discriminations
of
true
passion
are
the
colours
of
nature
they
pervade
the
whole
mass
and
can
only
perish
with
the
body
that
exhibits
them
the
accidental
compositions
of
heterogeneous
modes
are
dissolved
by
the
chance
which
combined
them
but
the
uniform
simplicity
of
primitive
qualities
neither
admits
increase
nor
suffers
decay
the
sand
heaped
by
one
flood
is
scattered
by
another
but
the
rock
always
continues
in
its
place
the
stream
of
time
which
is
continually
washing
the
dissoluble
fabricks
of
other
poets
passes
without
injury
by
the
adamant
of
shakespeare
if
there
be
what
i
believe
there
is
in
every
nation
a
stile
which
never
becomes
obsolete
a
certain
mode
of
phraseology
so
consonant
and
congenial
to
the
analogy
and
principles
of
its
respective
language
as
to
remain
settled
and
unaltered
this
stile
is
probably
to
be
sought
in
the
common
intercourse
of
life
among
those
who
speak
only
to
be
understood
without
ambition
of
elegance
the
polite
are
always
catching
modish
innovations
and
the
learned
depart
from
established
forms
of
speech
in
hope
of
finding
or
making
better
those
who
wish
for
distinction
forsake
the
vulgar
when
the
vulgar
is
right
but
there
is
a
conversation
above
grossness
and
below
refinement
where
propriety
resides
and
where
this
poet
seems
to
have
gathered
his
comick
dialogue
he
is
therefore
more
agreeable
to
the
ears
of
the
present
age
than
any
other
authour
equally
remote
and
among
his
other
excellencies
deserves
to
be
studied
as
one
of
the
original
masters
of
our
language
these
observations
are
to
be
considered
not
as
unexceptionably
constant
but
as
containing
general
and
predominant
truth
familiar
dialogue
is
affirmed
to
be
smooth
and
clear
yet
not
wholly
without
ruggedness
or
difficulty
as
a
country
may
be
eminently
fruitful
though
it
has
spots
unfit
for
cultivation
his
characters
are
praised
as
natural
though
their
sentiments
are
sometimes
forced
and
their
actions
improbable
as
the
earth
upon
the
whole
is
spherical
though
its
surface
is
varied
with
protuberances
and
cavities
shakespeare
with
his
excellencies
has
likewise
faults
and
faults
sufficient
to
obscure
and
overwhelm
any
other
merit
i
shall
shew
them
in
the
proportion
in
which
they
appear
to
me
without
envious
malignity
or
superstitious
veneration
no
question
can
be
more
innocently
discussed
than
a
dead
poet
pretensions
to
renown
and
little
regard
is
due
to
that
bigotry
which
sets
candour
higher
than
truth
his
first
defect
is
that
to
which
may
be
imputed
most
of
the
evil
in
books
or
in
men
he
sacrifices
virtue
to
convenience
and
is
so
much
more
careful
to
please
than
to
instruct
that
he
seems
to
write
without
any
moral
purpose
from
his
writings
indeed
a
system
of
social
duty
may
be
selected
for
he
that
thinks
reasonably
must
think
morally
but
his
precepts
and
axioms
drop
casually
from
him
he
makes
no
just
distribution
of
good
or
evil
nor
is
always
careful
to
shew
in
the
virtuous
a
disapprobation
of
the
wicked
he
carries
his
persons
indifferently
through
right
and
wrong
and
at
the
close
dismisses
them
without
further
care
and
leaves
their
examples
to
operate
by
chance
this
fault
the
barbarity
of
his
age
can
not
extenuate
for
it
is
always
a
writer
duty
to
make
the
world
better
and
justice
is
a
virtue
independant
on
time
or
place
the
plots
are
often
so
loosely
formed
that
a
very
slight
consideration
may
improve
them
and
so
carelessly
pursued
that
he
seems
not
always
fully
to
comprehend
his
own
design
he
omits
opportunities
of
instructing
or
delighting
which
the
train
of
his
story
seems
to
force
upon
him
and
apparently
rejects
those
exhibitions
which
would
be
more
affecting
for
the
sake
of
those
which
are
more
easy
it
may
be
observed
that
in
many
of
his
plays
the
latter
part
is
evidently
neglected
when
he
found
himself
near
the
end
of
his
work
and
in
view
of
his
reward
he
shortened
the
labour
to
snatch
the
profit
he
therefore
remits
his
efforts
where
he
should
most
vigorously
exert
them
and
his
catastrophe
is
improbably
produced
or
imperfectly
represented
he
had
no
regard
to
distinction
of
time
or
place
but
gives
to
one
age
or
nation
without
scruple
the
customs
institutions
and
opinions
of
another
at
the
expence
not
only
of
likelihood
but
of
possibility
these
faults
pope
has
endeavoured
with
more
zeal
than
judgment
to
transfer
to
his
imagined
in
interpolators
we
need
not
wonder
to
find
hector
quoting
aristotle
when
we
see
the
loves
of
theseus
and
hippolyta
combined
with
the
gothic
mythology
of
fairies
shakespeare
indeed
was
not
the
only
violator
of
chronology
for
in
the
same
age
sidney
who
wanted
not
the
advantages
of
learning
has
in
his
arcadia
confounded
the
pastoral
with
the
feudal
times
the
days
of
innocence
quiet
and
security
with
those
of
turbulence
violence
and
adventure
in
his
comick
scenes
he
is
seldom
very
successful
when
he
engages
his
characters
in
reciprocations
of
smartness
and
contest
of
sarcasm
their
jests
are
commonly
gross
and
their
pleasantry
licentious
neither
his
gentlemen
nor
his
ladies
have
much
delicacy
nor
are
sufficiently
distinguished
from
his
clowns
by
any
appearance
of
refined
manners
whether
he
represented
the
real
conversation
of
his
time
is
not
easy
to
determine
the
reign
of
elizabeth
is
commonly
supposed
to
have
been
a
time
of
stateliness
formality
and
reserve
yet
perhaps
the
relaxations
of
that
severity
were
not
very
elegant
there
must
however
have
been
always
some
modes
of
gayety
preferable
to
others
and
a
writer
ought
to
chuse
the
best
in
tragedy
his
performance
seems
constantly
to
be
worse
as
his
labour
is
more
the
effusions
of
passion
which
exigence
forces
out
are
for
the
most
part
striking
and
energetick
but
whenever
he
solicits
his
invention
or
strains
his
faculties
the
offspring
of
his
throes
is
tumour
meanness
tediousness
and
obscurity
in
narration
he
affects
a
disproportionate
pomp
of
diction
and
a
wearisome
train
of
circumlocution
and
tells
the
incident
imperfectly
in
many
words
which
might
have
been
more
plainly
delivered
in
few
narration
in
dramatick
poetry
is
naturally
tedious
as
it
is
unanimated
and
inactive
and
obstructs
the
progress
of
the
action
it
should
therefore
always
be
rapid
and
enlivened
by
frequent
interruption
shakespeare
found
it
an
encumbrance
and
instead
of
lightening
it
by
brevity
endeavoured
to
recommend
it
by
dignity
and
splendour
his
declamations
or
set
speeches
are
commonly
cold
and
weak
for
his
power
was
the
power
of
nature
when
he
endeavoured
like
other
tragick
writers
to
catch
opportunities
of
amplification
and
instead
of
inquiring
what
the
occasion
demanded
to
show
how
much
his
stores
of
knowledge
could
supply
he
seldom
escapes
without
the
pity
or
resentment
of
his
reader
it
is
incident
to
him
to
be
now
and
then
entangled
with
an
unwieldy
sentiment
which
he
can
not
well
express
and
will
not
reject
he
struggles
with
it
a
while
and
if
it
continues
stubborn
comprises
it
in
words
such
as
occur
and
leaves
it
to
be
disentangled
and
evolved
by
those
who
have
more
leisure
to
bestow
upon
it
not
that
always
where
the
language
is
intricate
the
thought
is
subtle
or
the
image
always
great
where
the
line
is
bulky
the
equality
of
words
to
things
is
very
often
neglected
and
trivial
sentiments
and
vulgar
ideas
disappoint
the
attention
to
which
they
are
recommended
by
sonorous
epithets
and
swelling
figures
but
the
admirers
of
this
great
poet
have
never
less
reason
to
indulge
their
hopes
of
supreme
excellence
than
when
he
seems
fully
resolved
to
sink
them
in
dejection
and
mollify
them
with
tender
emotions
by
the
fall
of
greatness
the
danger
of
innocence
or
the
crosses
of
love
he
is
not
long
soft
and
pathetick
without
some
idle
conceit
or
contemptible
equivocation
he
no
sooner
begins
to
move
than
he
counteracts
himself
and
terrour
and
pity
as
they
are
rising
in
the
mind
are
checked
and
blasted
by
sudden
frigidity
a
quibble
is
to
shakespeare
what
luminous
vapours
are
to
the
traveller
he
follows
it
at
all
adventures
it
is
sure
to
lead
him
out
of
his
way
and
sure
to
engulf
him
in
the
mire
it
has
some
malignant
power
over
his
mind
and
its
fascinations
are
irresistible
whatever
be
the
dignity
or
profundity
of
his
disquisition
whether
he
be
enlarging
knowledge
or
exalting
affection
whether
he
be
amusing
attention
with
incidents
or
enchaining
it
in
suspense
let
but
a
quibble
spring
up
before
him
and
he
leaves
his
work
unfinished
a
quibble
is
the
golden
apple
for
which
he
will
always
turn
aside
from
his
career
or
stoop
from
his
elevation
a
quibble
poor
and
barren
as
it
is
gave
him
such
delight
that
he
was
content
to
purchase
it
by
the
sacrifice
of
reason
propriety
and
truth
a
quibble
was
to
him
the
fatal
cleopatra
for
which
he
lost
the
world
and
was
content
to
lose
it
it
will
be
thought
strange
that
in
enumerating
the
defects
of
this
writer
i
have
not
yet
mentioned
his
neglect
of
the
unities
his
violation
of
those
laws
which
have
been
instituted
and
established
by
the
joint
authority
of
poets
and
of
criticks
for
his
other
deviations
from
the
art
of
writing
i
resign
him
to
critical
justice
without
making
any
other
demand
in
his
favour
than
that
which
must
be
indulged
to
all
human
excellence
that
his
virtues
be
rated
with
his
failings
but
from
the
censure
which
this
irregularity
may
bring
upon
him
i
shall
with
due
reverence
to
that
learning
which
i
must
oppose
adventure
to
try
how
i
can
defend
him
his
histories
being
neither
tragedies
nor
comedies
are
not
subject
to
any
of
their
laws
nothing
more
is
necessary
to
all
the
praise
which
they
expect
than
that
the
changes
of
action
be
so
prepared
as
to
be
understood
that
the
incidents
be
various
and
affecting
and
the
characters
consistent
natural
and
distinct
no
other
unity
is
intended
and
therefore
none
is
to
be
sought
in
his
other
works
he
has
well
enough
preserved
the
unity
of
action
he
has
not
indeed
an
intrigue
regularly
perplexed
and
regularly
unravelled
he
does
not
endeavour
to
hide
his
design
only
to
discover
it
for
this
is
seldom
the
order
of
real
events
and
shakespeare
is
the
poet
of
nature
but
his
plan
has
commonly
what
aristotle
requires
a
beginning
a
middle
and
an
end
one
event
is
concatenated
with
another
and
the
conclusion
follows
by
easy
consequence
there
are
perhaps
some
incidents
that
might
be
spared
as
in
other
poets
there
is
much
talk
that
only
fills
up
time
upon
the
stage
but
the
general
system
makes
gradual
advances
and
the
end
of
the
play
is
the
end
of
expectation
to
the
unities
of
time
and
place
he
has
shewn
no
regard
and
perhaps
a
nearer
view
of
the
principles
on
which
they
stand
will
diminish
their
value
and
withdraw
from
them
the
veneration
which
from
the
time
of
corneille
they
have
very
generally
received
by
discovering
that
they
have
given
more
trouble
to
the
poet
than
pleasure
to
the
auditor
the
necessity
of
observing
the
unities
of
time
and
place
arises
from
the
supposed
necessity
of
making
the
drama
credible
the
criticks
hold
it
impossible
that
an
action
of
months
or
years
can
be
possibly
believed
to
pass
in
three
hours
or
that
the
spectator
can
suppose
himself
to
sit
in
the
theatre
while
ambassadors
go
and
return
between
distant
kings
while
armies
are
levied
and
towns
besieged
while
an
exile
wanders
and
returns
or
till
he
whom
they
saw
courting
his
mistress
shall
lament
the
untimely
fall
of
his
son
the
mind
revolts
from
evident
falsehood
and
fiction
loses
its
force
when
it
departs
from
the
resemblance
of
reality
from
the
narrow
limitation
of
time
necessarily
arises
the
contraction
of
place
the
spectator
who
knows
that
he
saw
the
first
act
at
alexandria
can
not
suppose
that
he
sees
the
next
at
rome
at
a
distance
to
which
not
the
dragons
of
medea
could
in
so
short
a
time
have
transported
him
he
knows
with
certainty
that
he
has
not
changed
his
place
and
he
knows
that
place
can
not
change
itself
that
what
was
a
house
can
not
become
a
plain
that
what
was
thebes
can
never
be
persepolis
such
is
the
triumphant
language
with
which
a
critick
exults
over
the
misery
of
an
irregular
poet
and
exults
commonly
without
resistance
or
reply
it
is
time
therefore
to
tell
him
by
the
authority
of
shakespeare
that
he
assumes
as
an
unquestionable
principle
a
position
which
while
his
breath
is
forming
it
into
words
his
understanding
pronounces
to
be
false
it
is
false
that
any
representation
is
mistaken
for
reality
that
any
dramatick
fable
in
its
materiality
was
ever
credible
or
for
a
single
moment
was
ever
credited
the
objection
arising
from
the
impossibility
of
passing
the
first
hour
at
alexandria
and
the
next
at
rome
supposes
that
when
the
play
opens
the
spectator
really
imagines
himself
at
alexandria
and
believes
that
his
walk
to
the
theatre
has
been
a
voyage
to
egypt
and
that
he
lives
in
the
days
of
antony
and
cleopatra
surely
he
that
imagines
this
may
imagine
more
he
that
can
take
the
stage
at
one
time
for
the
palace
of
the
ptolemies
may
take
it
in
half
an
hour
for
the
promontory
of
actium
delusion
if
delusion
be
admitted
has
no
certain
limitation
if
the
spectator
can
be
once
persuaded
that
his
old
acquaintance
are
alexander
and
caesar
that
a
room
illuminated
with
candles
is
the
plain
of
pharsalia
or
the
bank
of
granicus
he
is
in
a
state
of
elevation
above
the
reach
of
reason
or
of
truth
and
from
the
heights
of
empyrean
poetry
may
despise
the
circumscriptions
of
terrestrial
nature
there
is
no
reason
why
a
mind
thus
wandering
in
extasy
should
count
the
clock
or
why
an
hour
should
not
be
a
century
in
that
calenture
of
the
brains
that
can
make
the
stage
a
field
the
truth
is
that
the
spectators
are
always
in
their
senses
and
know
from
the
first
act
to
the
last
that
the
stage
is
only
a
stage
and
that
the
players
are
only
players
they
come
to
hear
a
certain
number
of
lines
recited
with
just
gesture
and
elegant
modulation
the
lines
relate
to
some
action
and
an
action
must
be
in
some
place
but
the
different
actions
that
compleat
a
story
may
be
in
places
very
remote
from
each
other
and
where
is
the
absurdity
of
allowing
that
space
to
represent
first
athens
and
then
sicily
which
was
always
known
to
be
neither
sicily
nor
athens
but
a
modern
theatre
by
supposition
as
place
is
introduced
time
may
be
extended
the
time
required
by
the
fable
elapses
for
the
most
part
between
the
acts
for
of
so
much
of
the
action
as
is
represented
the
real
and
poetical
duration
is
the
same
if
in
the
first
act
preparations
for
war
against
mithridates
are
represented
to
be
made
in
rome
the
event
of
the
war
may
without
absurdity
be
represented
in
the
catastrophe
as
happening
in
pontus
we
know
that
there
is
neither
war
nor
preparation
for
war
we
know
that
we
are
neither
in
rome
nor
pontus
that
neither
mithridates
nor
lucullus
are
before
us
the
drama
exhibits
successive
imitations
of
successive
actions
and
why
may
not
the
second
imitation
represent
an
action
that
happened
years
after
the
first
if
it
be
so
connected
with
it
that
nothing
but
time
can
be
supposed
to
intervene
time
is
of
all
modes
of
existence
most
obsequious
to
the
imagination
a
lapse
of
years
is
as
easily
conceived
as
a
passage
of
hours
in
contemplation
we
easily
contract
the
time
of
real
actions
and
therefore
willingly
permit
it
to
be
contracted
when
we
only
see
their
imitation
it
will
be
asked
how
the
drama
moves
if
it
is
not
credited
it
is
credited
with
all
the
credit
due
to
a
drama
it
is
credited
whenever
it
moves
as
a
just
picture
of
a
real
original
as
representing
to
the
auditor
what
he
would
himself
feel
if
he
were
to
do
or
suffer
what
is
there
feigned
to
be
suffered
or
to
be
done
the
reflection
that
strikes
the
heart
is
not
that
the
evils
before
us
are
real
evils
but
that
they
are
evils
to
which
we
ourselves
may
be
exposed
if
there
be
any
fallacy
it
is
not
that
we
fancy
the
players
but
that
we
fancy
ourselves
unhappy
for
a
moment
but
we
rather
lament
the
possibility
than
suppose
the
presence
of
misery
as
a
mother
weeps
over
her
babe
when
she
remembers
that
death
may
take
it
from
her
the
delight
of
tragedy
proceeds
from
our
consciousness
of
fiction
if
we
thought
murders
and
treasons
real
they
would
please
no
more
imitations
produce
pain
or
pleasure
not
because
they
are
mistaken
for
realities
but
because
they
bring
realities
to
mind
when
the
imagination
is
recreated
by
a
painted
landscape
the
trees
are
not
supposed
capable
to
give
us
shade
or
the
fountains
coolness
but
we
consider
how
we
should
be
pleased
with
such
fountains
playing
beside
us
and
such
woods
waving
over
us
we
are
agitated
in
reading
the
history
of
henry
the
fifth
yet
no
man
takes
his
book
for
the
field
of
agencourt
a
dramatick
exhibition
is
a
book
recited
with
concomitants
that
encrease
or
diminish
its
effect
familiar
comedy
is
often
more
powerful
on
the
theatre
than
in
the
page
imperial
tragedy
is
always
less
the
humour
of
petruchio
may
be
heightened
by
grimace
but
what
voice
or
what
gesture
can
hope
to
add
dignity
or
force
to
the
soliloquy
of
cato
a
play
read
affects
the
mind
like
a
play
acted
it
is
therefore
evident
that
the
action
is
not
supposed
to
be
real
and
it
follows
that
between
the
acts
a
longer
or
shorter
time
may
be
allowed
to
pass
and
that
no
more
account
of
space
or
duration
is
to
be
taken
by
the
auditor
of
a
drama
than
by
the
reader
of
a
narrative
before
whom
may
pass
in
an
hour
the
life
of
a
hero
or
the
revolutions
of
an
empire
whether
shakespeare
knew
the
unities
and
rejected
them
by
design
or
deviated
from
them
by
happy
ignorance
it
is
i
think
impossible
to
decide
and
useless
to
inquire
we
may
reasonably
suppose
that
when
he
rose
to
notice
he
did
not
want
the
counsels
and
admonitions
of
scholars
and
criticks
and
that
he
at
last
deliberately
persisted
in
a
practice
which
he
might
have
begun
by
chance
as
nothing
is
essential
to
the
fable
but
unity
of
action
and
as
the
unities
of
time
and
place
arise
evidently
from
false
assumptions
and
by
circumscribing
the
extent
of
the
drama
lessen
its
variety
i
can
not
think
it
much
to
be
lamented
that
they
were
not
known
by
him
or
not
observed
nor
if
such
another
poet
could
arise
should
i
very
vehemently
reproach
him
that
his
first
act
passed
at
venice
and
his
next
in
cyprus
such
violations
of
rules
merely
positive
become
the
comprehensive
genius
of
shakespeare
and
such
censures
are
suitable
to
the
minute
and
slender
criticism
of
voltaire
non
usque
adeo
permiscuit
imis
longus
summa
dies
ut
non
si
voce
metelli
serventur
leges
malint
a
caesare
tolli
yet
when
i
speak
thus
slightly
of
dramatick
rules
i
can
not
but
recollect
how
much
wit
and
learning
may
be
produced
against
me
before
such
authorities
i
am
afraid
to
stand
not
that
i
think
the
present
question
one
of
those
that
are
to
be
decided
by
mere
authority
but
because
it
is
to
be
suspected
that
these
precepts
have
not
been
so
easily
received
but
for
better
reasons
than
i
have
yet
been
able
to
find
the
result
of
my
enquiries
in
which
it
would
be
ludicrous
to
boast
of
impartiality
is
that
the
unities
of
time
and
place
are
not
essential
to
a
just
drama
that
though
they
may
sometimes
conduce
to
pleasure
they
are
always
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
nobler
beauties
of
variety
and
instruction
and
that
a
play
written
with
nice
observation
of
critical
rules
is
to
be
contemplated
as
an
elaborate
curiosity
as
the
product
of
superfluous
and
ostentatious
art
by
which
is
shewn
rather
what
is
possible
than
what
is
necessary
he
that
without
diminution
of
any
other
excellence
shall
preserve
all
the
unities
unbroken
deserves
the
like
applause
with
the
architect
who
shall
display
all
the
orders
of
architecture
in
a
citadel
without
any
deduction
from
its
strength
but
the
principal
beauty
of
a
citadel
is
to
exclude
the
enemy
and
the
greatest
graces
of
a
play
are
to
copy
nature
and
instruct
life
perhaps
what
i
have
here
not
dogmatically
but
deliberately
written
may
recal
the
principles
of
the
drama
to
a
new
examination
i
am
almost
frighted
at
my
own
temerity
and
when
i
estimate
the
fame
and
the
strength
of
those
that
maintain
the
contrary
opinion
am
ready
to
sink
down
in
reverential
silence
as
aeneas
withdrew
from
the
defence
of
troy
when
he
saw
neptune
shaking
the
wall
and
juno
heading
the
besiegers
those
whom
my
arguments
can
not
persuade
to
give
their
approbation
to
the
judgment
of
shakespeare
will
easily
if
they
consider
the
condition
of
his
life
make
some
allowance
for
his
ignorance
every
man
performances
to
be
rightly
estimated
must
be
compared
with
the
state
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
and
with
his
own
particular
opportunities
and
though
to
the
reader
a
book
be
not
worse
or
better
for
the
circumstances
of
the
authour
yet
as
there
is
always
a
silent
reference
of
human
works
to
human
abilities
and
as
the
enquiry
how
far
man
may
extend
his
designs
or
how
high
he
may
rate
his
native
force
is
of
far
greater
dignity
than
in
what
rank
we
shall
place
any
particular
performance
curiosity
is
always
busy
to
discover
the
instruments
as
well
as
to
survey
the
workmanship
to
know
how
much
is
to
be
ascribed
to
original
powers
and
how
much
to
casual
and
adventitious
help
the
palaces
of
peru
or
mexico
were
certainly
mean
and
incommodious
habitations
if
compared
to
the
houses
of
european
monarchs
yet
who
could
forbear
to
view
them
with
astonishment
who
remembered
that
they
were
built
without
the
use
of
iron
the
english
nation
in
the
time
of
shakespeare
was
yet
struggling
to
emerge
from
barbarity
the
philology
of
italy
had
been
transplanted
hither
in
the
reign
of
henry
the
eighth
and
the
learned
languages
had
been
successfully
cultivated
by
lilly
and
more
by
pole
cheke
and
gardiner
and
afterwards
by
smith
clerk
haddon
and
ascham
greek
was
now
taught
to
boys
in
the
principal
schools
and
those
who
united
elegance
with
learning
read
with
great
diligence
the
italian
and
spanish
poets
but
literature
was
yet
confined
to
professed
scholars
or
to
men
and
women
of
high
rank
the
publick
was
gross
and
dark
and
to
be
able
to
read
and
write
was
an
accomplishment
still
valued
for
its
rarity
nations
like
individuals
have
their
infancy
a
people
newly
awakened
to
literary
curiosity
being
yet
unacquainted
with
the
true
state
of
things
knows
not
how
to
judge
of
that
which
is
proposed
as
its
resemblance
whatever
is
remote
from
common
appearances
is
always
welcome
to
vulgar
as
to
childish
credulity
and
of
a
country
unenlightened
by
learning
the
whole
people
is
the
vulgar
the
study
of
those
who
then
aspired
to
plebeian
learning
was
laid
out
upon
adventures
giants
dragons
and
enchantments
the
death
of
arthur
was
the
favourite
volume
the
mind
which
has
feasted
on
the
luxurious
wonders
of
fiction
has
no
taste
of
the
insipidity
of
truth
a
play
which
imitated
only
the
common
occurrences
of
the
world
would
upon
the
admirers
of
palmerin
and
guy
of
warwick
have
made
little
impression
he
that
wrote
for
such
an
audience
was
under
the
necessity
of
looking
round
for
strange
events
and
fabulous
transactions
and
that
incredibility
by
which
maturer
knowledge
is
offended
was
the
chief
recommendation
of
writings
to
unskilful
curiosity
our
authour
plots
are
generally
borrowed
from
novels
and
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
he
chose
the
most
popular
such
as
were
read
by
many
and
related
by
more
for
his
audience
could
not
have
followed
him
through
the
intricacies
of
the
drama
had
they
not
held
the
thread
of
the
story
in
their
hands
the
stories
which
we
now
find
only
in
remoter
authours
were
in
his
time
accessible
and
familliar
the
fable
of
as
you
like
it
which
is
supposed
to
be
copied
from
chaucer
gamelyn
was
a
little
pamphlet
of
those
times
and
old
cibber
remembered
the
tale
of
hamlet
in
plain
english
prose
which
the
criticks
have
now
to
seek
in
saxo
grammaticus
his
english
histories
he
took
from
english
chronicles
and
english
ballads
and
as
the
ancient
writers
were
made
known
to
his
countrymen
by
versions
they
supplied
him
with
new
subjects
he
dilated
some
of
plutarch
lives
into
plays
when
they
had
been
translated
by
north
his
plots
whether
historical
or
fabulous
are
always
crouded
with
incidents
by
which
the
attention
of
a
rude
people
was
more
easily
caught
than
by
sentiment
or
argumentation
and
such
is
the
power
of
the
marvellous
even
over
those
who
despise
it
that
every
man
finds
his
mind
more
strongly
seized
by
the
tragedies
of
shakespeare
than
of
any
other
writer
others
please
us
by
particular
speeches
but
he
always
makes
us
anxious
for
the
event
and
has
perhaps
excelled
all
but
homer
in
securing
the
first
purpose
of
a
writer
by
exciting
restless
and
unquenchable
curiosity
and
compelling
him
that
reads
his
work
to
read
it
through
the
shows
and
bustle
with
which
his
plays
abound
have
the
same
original
as
knowledge
advances
pleasure
passes
from
the
eye
to
the
ear
but
returns
as
it
declines
from
the
ear
to
the
eye
those
to
whom
our
authour
labours
were
exhibited
had
more
skill
in
pomps
or
processions
than
in
poetical
language
and
perhaps
wanted
some
visible
and
discriminated
events
as
comments
on
the
dialogue
he
knew
how
he
should
most
please
and
whether
his
practice
is
more
agreeable
to
nature
or
whether
his
example
has
prejudiced
the
nation
we
still
find
that
on
our
stage
something
must
be
done
as
well
as
said
and
inactive
declamation
is
very
coldly
heard
however
musical
or
elegant
passionate
or
sublime
voltaire
expresses
his
wonder
that
our
authour
extravagancies
are
endured
by
a
nation
which
has
seen
the
tragedy
of
cato
let
him
be
answered
that
addison
speaks
the
language
of
poets
and
shakespeare
of
men
we
find
in
cato
innumerable
beauties
which
enamour
us
of
its
authour
but
we
see
nothing
that
acquaints
us
with
human
sentiments
or
human
actions
we
place
it
with
the
fairest
and
the
noblest
progeny
which
judgment
propagates
by
conjunction
with
learning
but
othello
is
the
vigorous
and
vivacious
offspring
of
observation
impregnated
by
genius
cato
affords
a
splendid
exhibition
of
artificial
and
fictitious
manners
and
delivers
just
and
noble
sentiments
in
diction
easy
elevated
and
harmonious
but
its
hopes
and
fears
communicate
no
vibration
to
the
heart
the
composition
refers
us
only
to
the
writer
we
pronounce
the
name
of
cato
but
we
think
on
addison
the
work
of
a
correct
and
regular
writer
is
a
garden
accurately
formed
and
diligently
planted
varied
with
shades
and
scented
with
flowers
the
composition
of
shakespeare
is
a
forest
in
which
oaks
extend
their
branches
and
pines
tower
in
the
air
interspersed
sometimes
with
weeds
and
brambles
and
sometimes
giving
shelter
to
myrtles
and
to
roses
filling
the
eye
with
awful
pomp
and
gratifying
the
mind
with
endless
diversity
other
poets
display
cabinets
of
precious
rarities
minutely
finished
wrought
into
shape
and
polished
unto
brightness
shakespeare
opens
a
mine
which
contains
gold
and
diamonds
in
unexhaustible
plenty
though
clouded
by
incrustations
debased
by
impurities
and
mingled
with
a
mass
of
meaner
minerals
it
has
been
much
disputed
whether
shakespeare
owed
his
excellence
to
his
own
native
force
or
whether
he
had
the
common
helps
of
scholastick
education
the
precepts
of
critical
science
and
the
examples
of
ancient
authours
there
has
always
prevailed
a
tradition
that
shakespeare
wanted
learning
that
he
had
no
regular
education
nor
much
skill
in
the
dead
languages
johnson
his
friend
affirms
that
he
had
small
latin
and
no
greek
who
besides
that
he
had
no
imaginable
temptation
to
falsehood
wrote
at
a
time
when
the
character
and
acquisitions
of
shakespeare
were
known
to
multitudes
his
evidence
ought
therefore
to
decide
the
controversy
unless
some
testimony
of
equal
force
could
be
opposed
some
have
imagined
that
they
have
discovered
deep
learning
in
many
imitations
of
old
writers
but
the
examples
which
i
have
known
urged
were
drawn
from
books
translated
in
his
time
or
were
such
easy
coincidencies
of
thought
as
will
happen
to
all
who
consider
the
same
subjects
or
such
remarks
on
life
or
axioms
of
morality
as
float
in
conversation
and
are
transmitted
through
the
world
in
proverbial
sentences
i
have
found
it
remarked
that
in
this
important
sentence
go
before
i
follow
we
read
a
translation
of
i
prae
sequar
i
have
been
told
that
when
caliban
after
a
pleasing
dream
says
i
cry
to
sleep
again
the
authour
imitates
anacreon
who
had
like
every
other
man
the
same
wish
on
the
same
occasion
there
are
a
few
passages
which
may
pass
for
imitations
but
so
few
that
the
exception
only
confirms
the
rule
he
obtained
them
from
accidental
quotations
or
by
oral
communication
and
as
he
used
what
he
had
would
have
used
more
if
he
had
obtained
it
the
comedy
of
errors
is
confessedly
taken
from
the
menaechmi
of
plautus
from
the
only
play
of
plautus
which
was
then
in
english
what
can
be
more
probable
than
that
he
who
copied
that
would
have
copied
more
but
that
those
which
were
not
translated
were
inaccessible
whether
he
knew
the
modern
languages
is
uncertain
that
his
plays
have
some
french
scenes
proves
but
little
he
might
easily
procure
them
to
be
written
and
probably
even
though
he
had
known
the
language
in
the
common
degree
he
could
not
have
written
it
without
assistance
in
the
story
of
romeo
and
juliet
he
is
observed
to
have
followed
the
english
translation
where
it
deviates
from
the
italian
but
this
on
the
other
part
proves
nothing
against
his
knowledge
of
the
original
he
was
to
copy
not
what
he
knew
himself
but
what
was
known
to
his
audience
it
is
most
likely
that
he
had
learned
latin
sufficiently
to
make
him
acquainted
with
construction
but
that
he
never
advanced
to
an
easy
perusal
of
the
roman
authours
concerning
his
skill
in
modern
languages
i
can
find
no
sufficient
ground
of
determination
but
as
no
imitations
of
french
or
italian
authours
have
been
discovered
though
the
italian
poetry
was
then
high
in
esteem
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
he
read
little
more
than
english
and
chose
for
his
fables
only
such
tales
as
he
found
translated
that
much
knowledge
is
scattered
over
his
works
is
very
justly
observed
by
pope
but
it
is
often
such
knowledge
as
books
did
not
supply
he
that
will
understand
shakespeare
must
not
be
content
to
study
him
in
the
closet
he
must
look
for
his
meaning
sometimes
among
the
sports
of
the
field
and
sometimes
among
the
manufactures
of
the
shop
there
is
however
proof
enough
that
he
was
a
very
diligent
reader
nor
was
our
language
then
so
indigent
of
books
but
that
he
might
very
liberally
indulge
his
curiosity
without
excursion
into
foreign
literature
many
of
the
roman
authours
were
translated
and
some
of
the
greek
the
reformation
had
filled
the
kingdom
with
theological
learning
most
of
the
topicks
of
human
disquisition
had
found
english
writers
and
poetry
had
been
cultivated
not
only
with
diligence
but
success
this
was
a
stock
of
knowledge
sufficient
for
a
mind
so
capable
of
appropriating
and
improving
it
but
the
greater
part
of
his
excellence
was
the
product
of
his
own
genius
he
found
the
english
stage
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
rudeness
no
essays
either
in
tragedy
or
comedy
had
appeared
from
which
it
could
be
discovered
to
what
degree
of
delight
either
one
or
other
might
be
carried
neither
character
nor
dialogue
were
yet
understood
shakespeare
may
be
truly
said
to
have
introduced
them
both
amongst
us
and
in
some
of
his
happier
scenes
to
have
carried
them
both
to
the
utmost
height
by
what
gradations
of
improvement
he
proceeded
is
not
easily
known
for
the
chronology
of
his
works
is
yet
unsettled
rowe
is
of
opinion
that
perhaps
we
are
not
to
look
for
his
beginning
like
those
of
other
writers
in
his
least
perfect
works
art
had
so
little
and
nature
so
large
a
share
in
what
he
did
that
for
ought
i
know
says
he
the
performances
of
his
youth
as
they
were
the
most
vigorous
were
the
best
but
the
power
of
nature
is
only
the
power
of
using
to
any
certain
purpose
the
materials
which
diligence
procures
or
opportunity
supplies
nature
gives
no
man
knowledge
and
when
images
are
collected
by
study
and
experience
can
only
assist
in
combining
or
applying
them
shakespeare
however
favoured
by
nature
could
impart
only
what
he
had
learned
and
as
he
must
increase
his
ideas
like
other
mortals
by
gradual
acquisition
he
like
them
grew
wiser
as
he
grew
older
could
display
life
better
as
he
knew
it
more
and
instruct
with
more
efficacy
as
he
was
himself
more
amply
instructed
there
is
a
vigilance
of
observation
and
accuracy
of
distinction
which
books
and
precepts
can
not
confer
from
this
almost
all
original
and
native
excellence
proceeds
shakespeare
must
have
looked
upon
mankind
with
perspicacity
in
the
highest
degree
curious
and
attentive
other
writers
borrow
their
characters
from
preceding
writers
and
diversify
them
only
by
the
accidental
appendages
of
present
manners
the
dress
is
a
little
varied
but
the
body
is
the
same
our
authour
had
both
matter
and
form
to
provide
for
except
the
characters
of
chaucer
to
whom
i
think
he
is
not
much
indebted
there
were
no
writers
in
english
and
perhaps
not
many
in
other
modern
languages
which
shewed
life
in
its
native
colours
the
contest
about
the
original
benevolence
or
malignity
of
man
had
not
yet
commenced
speculation
had
not
yet
attempted
to
analyse
the
mind
to
trace
the
passions
to
their
sources
to
unfold
the
seminal
principles
of
vice
and
virtue
or
sound
the
depths
of
the
heart
for
the
motives
of
action
all
those
enquiries
which
from
that
time
that
human
nature
became
the
fashionable
study
have
been
made
sometimes
with
nice
discernment
but
often
with
idle
subtilty
were
yet
unattempted
the
tales
with
which
the
infancy
of
learning
was
satisfied
exhibited
only
the
superficial
appearances
of
action
related
the
events
but
omitted
the
causes
and
were
formed
for
such
as
delighted
in
wonders
rather
than
in
truth
mankind
was
not
then
to
be
studied
in
the
closet
he
that
would
know
the
world
was
under
the
necessity
of
gleaning
his
own
remarks
by
mingling
as
he
could
in
its
business
and
amusements
boyle
congratulated
himself
upon
his
high
birth
because
it
favoured
his
curiosity
by
facilitating
his
access
shakespeare
had
no
such
advantage
he
came
to
london
a
needy
adventurer
and
lived
for
a
time
by
very
mean
employments
many
works
of
genius
and
learning
have
been
performed
in
states
of
life
that
appear
very
little
favourable
to
thought
or
to
enquiry
so
many
that
he
who
considers
them
is
inclined
to
think
that
he
sees
enterprise
and
perseverance
predominating
over
all
external
agency
and
bidding
help
and
hindrance
vanish
before
them
the
genius
of
shakespeare
was
not
to
be
depressed
by
the
weight
of
poverty
nor
limited
by
the
narrow
conversation
to
which
men
in
want
are
inevitably
condemned
the
incumbrances
of
his
fortune
were
shaken
from
his
mind
as
dewdrops
from
a
lion
mane
though
he
had
so
many
difficulties
to
encounter
and
so
little
assistance
to
surmount
them
he
has
been
able
to
obtain
an
exact
knowledge
of
many
modes
of
life
and
many
casts
of
native
dispositions
to
vary
them
with
great
multiplicity
to
mark
them
by
nice
distinctions
and
to
shew
them
in
full
view
by
proper
combinations
in
this
part
of
his
performances
he
had
none
to
imitate
but
has
himself
been
imitated
by
all
succeeding
writers
and
it
may
be
doubted
whether
from
all
his
successors
more
maxims
of
theoretical
knowledge
or
more
rules
of
practical
prudence
can
be
collected
than
he
alone
has
given
to
his
country
nor
was
his
attention
confined
to
the
actions
of
men
he
was
an
exact
surveyor
of
the
inanimate
world
his
descriptions
have
always
some
peculiarities
gathered
by
contemplating
things
as
they
really
exist
it
may
be
observed
that
the
oldest
poets
of
many
nations
preserve
their
reputation
and
that
the
following
generations
of
wit
after
a
short
celebrity
sink
into
oblivion
the
first
whoever
they
be
must
take
their
sentiments
and
descriptions
immediately
from
knowledge
the
resemblance
is
therefore
just
their
descriptions
are
verified
by
every
eye
and
their
sentiments
acknowledged
by
every
breast
those
whom
their
fame
invites
to
the
same
studies
copy
partly
them
and
partly
nature
till
the
books
of
one
age
gain
such
authority
as
to
stand
in
the
place
of
nature
to
another
and
imitation
always
deviating
a
little
becomes
at
last
capricious
and
casual
shakespeare
whether
life
or
nature
be
his
subject
shews
plainly
that
he
has
seen
with
his
own
eyes
he
gives
the
image
which
he
receives
not
weakened
or
distorted
by
the
intervention
of
any
other
mind
the
ignorant
feel
his
representations
to
be
just
and
the
learned
see
that
they
are
compleat
perhaps
it
would
not
be
easy
to
find
any
authour
except
homer
who
invented
so
much
as
shakespeare
who
so
much
advanced
the
studies
which
he
cultivated
or
effused
so
much
novelty
upon
his
age
or
country
the
form
the
characters
the
language
and
the
shows
of
the
english
drama
are
his
he
seems
says
dennis
to
have
been
the
very
original
of
our
english
tragical
harmony
that
is
the
harmony
of
blank
verse
diversified
often
by
dissyllable
and
trissyllable
terminations
for
the
diversity
distinguishes
it
from
heroick
harmony
and
by
bringing
it
nearer
to
common
use
makes
it
more
proper
to
gain
attention
and
more
fit
for
action
and
dialogue
such
verse
we
make
when
we
are
writing
prose
we
make
such
verse
in
common
conversation
i
know
not
whether
this
praise
is
rigorously
just
the
dissyllable
termination
which
the
critick
rightly
appropriates
to
the
drama
is
to
be
found
though
i
think
not
in
gorboduc
which
is
confessedly
before
our
authour
yet
in
hieronnymo
of
which
the
date
is
not
certain
but
which
there
is
reason
to
believe
at
least
as
old
as
his
earliest
plays
this
however
is
certain
that
he
is
the
first
who
taught
either
tragedy
or
comedy
to
please
there
being
no
theatrical
piece
of
any
older
writer
of
which
the
name
is
known
except
to
antiquaries
and
collectors
of
books
which
are
sought
because
they
are
scarce
and
would
not
have
been
scarce
had
they
been
much
esteemed
to
him
we
must
ascribe
the
praise
unless
spenser
may
divide
it
with
him
of
having
first
discovered
to
how
much
smoothness
and
harmony
the
english
language
could
be
softened
he
has
speeches
perhaps
sometimes
scenes
which
have
all
the
delicacy
of
rowe
without
his
effeminacy
he
endeavours
indeed
commonly
to
strike
by
the
force
and
vigour
of
his
dialogue
but
he
never
executes
his
purpose
better
than
when
he
tries
to
sooth
by
softness
yet
it
must
be
at
last
confessed
that
as
we
owe
every
thing
to
him
he
owes
something
to
us
that
if
much
of
his
praise
is
paid
by
perception
and
judgement
much
is
likewise
given
by
custom
and
veneration
we
fix
our
eyes
upon
his
graces
and
turn
them
from
his
deformities
and
endure
in
him
what
we
should
in
another
loath
or
despise
if
we
endured
without
praising
respect
for
the
father
of
our
drama
might
excuse
us
but
i
have
seen
in
the
book
of
some
modern
critick
a
collection
of
anomalies
which
shew
that
he
has
corrupted
language
by
every
mode
of
depravation
but
which
his
admirer
has
accumulated
as
a
monument
of
honour
he
has
scenes
of
undoubted
and
perpetual
excellence
but
perhaps
not
one
play
which
if
it
were
now
exhibited
as
the
work
of
a
contemporary
writer
would
be
heard
to
the
conclusion
i
am
indeed
far
from
thinking
that
his
works
were
wrought
to
his
own
ideas
of
perfection
when
they
were
such
as
would
satisfy
the
audience
they
satisfied
the
writer
it
is
seldom
that
authours
though
more
studious
of
fame
than
shakespeare
rise
much
above
the
standard
of
their
own
age
to
add
a
little
of
what
is
best
will
always
be
sufficient
for
present
praise
and
those
who
find
themselves
exalted
into
fame
are
willing
to
credit
their
encomiasts
and
to
spare
the
labour
of
contending
with
themselves
it
does
not
appear
that
shakespeare
thought
his
works
worthy
of
posterity
that
he
levied
any
ideal
tribute
upon
future
times
or
had
any
further
prospect
than
of
present
popularity
and
present
profit
when
his
plays
had
been
acted
his
hope
was
at
an
end
he
solicited
no
addition
of
honour
from
the
reader
he
therefore
made
no
scruple
to
repeat
the
same
jests
in
many
dialogues
or
to
entangle
different
plots
by
the
same
knot
of
perplexity
which
may
be
at
least
forgiven
him
by
those
who
recollect
that
of
four
comedies
two
are
concluded
by
a
marriage
in
a
mask
by
a
deception
which
perhaps
never
happened
and
which
whether
likely
or
not
he
did
not
invent
so
careless
was
this
great
poet
of
future
fame
that
though
he
retired
to
ease
and
plenty
while
he
was
yet
little
declined
into
the
vale
of
years
before
he
could
be
disgusted
with
fatigue
or
disabled
by
infirmity
he
made
no
collection
of
his
works
nor
desired
to
rescue
those
that
had
been
already
published
from
the
depravations
that
obscured
them
or
secure
to
the
rest
a
better
destiny
by
giving
them
to
the
world
in
their
genuine
state
of
the
plays
which
bear
the
name
of
shakespeare
in
the
late
editions
the
greater
part
were
not
published
till
about
seven
years
after
his
death
and
the
few
which
appeared
in
his
life
are
apparently
thrust
into
the
world
without
the
care
of
the
authour
and
therefore
probably
without
his
knowledge
of
all
the
publishers
clandestine
or
professed
their
negligence
and
unskilfulness
has
by
the
late
revisers
been
sufficiently
shown
the
faults
of
all
are
indeed
numerous
and
gross
and
have
not
only
corrupted
many
passages
perhaps
beyond
recovery
but
have
brought
others
into
suspicion
which
are
only
obscured
by
obsolete
phraseology
or
by
the
writer
unskilfulness
and
affectation
to
alter
is
more
easy
than
to
explain
and
temerity
is
a
more
common
quality
than
diligence
those
who
saw
that
they
must
employ
conjecture
to
a
certain
degree
were
willing
to
indulge
it
a
little
further
had
the
authour
published
his
own
works
we
should
have
sat
quietly
down
to
disentangle
his
intricacies
and
clear
his
obscurities
but
now
we
tear
what
we
can
not
loose
and
eject
what
we
happen
not
to
understand
the
faults
are
more
than
could
have
happened
without
the
concurrence
of
many
causes
the
stile
of
shakespeare
was
in
itself
ungrammatical
perplexed
and
obscure
his
works
were
transcribed
for
the
players
by
those
who
may
be
supposed
to
have
seldom
understood
them
they
were
transmitted
by
copiers
equally
unskilful
who
still
multiplied
errours
they
were
perhaps
sometimes
mutilated
by
the
actors
for
the
sake
of
shortening
the
speeches
and
were
at
last
printed
without
correction
of
the
press
in
this
state
they
remained
not
as
warburton
supposes
because
they
were
unregarded
but
because
the
editor
art
was
not
yet
applied
to
modern
languages
and
our
ancestors
were
accustomed
to
so
much
negligence
of
english
printers
that
they
could
very
patiently
endure
it
at
last
an
edition
was
undertaken
by
rowe
not
because
a
poet
was
to
be
published
by
a
poet
for
rowe
seems
to
have
thought
very
little
on
correction
or
explanation
but
that
our
authour
works
might
appear
like
those
of
his
fraternity
with
the
appendages
of
a
life
and
recommendatory
preface
rowe
has
been
clamorously
blamed
for
not
performing
what
he
did
not
undertake
and
it
is
time
that
justice
be
done
him
by
confessing
that
though
he
seems
to
have
had
no
thought
of
corruption
beyond
the
errours
yet
he
has
made
many
emendations
if
they
were
not
made
before
which
his
successors
have
received
without
acknowledgment
and
which
if
they
had
produced
them
would
have
filled
pages
and
pages
with
censures
of
the
stupidity
by
which
the
faults
were
committed
with
displays
of
the
absurdities
which
they
involved
with
ostentatious
exposition
of
the
new
reading
and
self
congratulations
on
the
happiness
of
discovering
it
of
rowe
as
of
all
the
editors
i
have
preserved
the
preface
and
have
likewise
retained
the
authour
life
though
not
written
with
much
elegance
or
spirit
it
relates
however
what
is
now
to
be
known
and
therefore
deserves
to
pass
through
all
succeeding
publications
the
nation
had
been
for
many
years
content
enough
with
performance
when
pope
made
them
acquainted
with
the
true
state
of
shakespeare
text
shewed
that
it
was
extremely
corrupt
and
gave
reason
to
hope
that
there
were
means
of
reforming
it
he
collated
the
old
copies
which
none
had
thought
to
examine
before
and
restored
many
lines
to
their
integrity
but
by
a
very
compendious
criticism
he
rejected
whatever
he
disliked
and
thought
more
of
amputation
than
of
cure
i
know
not
why
he
is
commended
by
warburton
for
distinguishing
the
genuine
from
the
spurious
plays
in
this
choice
he
exerted
no
judgement
of
his
own
the
plays
which
he
received
were
given
by
hemings
and
condel
the
first
editors
and
those
which
he
rejected
though
according
to
the
licentiousness
of
the
press
in
those
times
they
were
printed
during
shakespeare
life
with
his
name
had
been
omitted
by
his
friends
and
were
never
added
to
his
works
before
the
edition
of
from
which
they
were
copied
by
the
later
printers
this
was
a
work
which
pope
seems
to
have
thought
unworthy
of
his
abilities
being
not
able
to
suppress
his
contempt
of
the
dull
duty
of
an
editor
he
understood
but
half
his
undertaking
the
duty
of
a
collator
is
indeed
dull
yet
like
other
tedious
tasks
is
very
necessary
but
an
emendatory
critick
would
ill
discharge
his
duty
without
qualities
very
different
from
dulness
in
perusing
a
corrupted
piece
he
must
have
before
him
all
possibilities
of
meaning
with
all
possibilities
of
expression
such
must
be
his
comprehension
of
thought
and
such
his
copiousness
of
language
out
of
many
readings
possible
he
must
be
able
to
select
that
which
best
suits
with
the
state
opinions
and
modes
of
language
prevailing
in
every
age
and
with
his
authour
particular
cast
of
thought
and
turn
of
expression
such
must
be
his
knowledge
and
such
his
taste
conjectural
criticism
demands
more
than
humanity
possesses
and
he
that
exercises
it
with
most
praise
has
very
frequent
need
of
indulgence
let
us
now
be
told
no
more
of
the
dull
duty
of
an
editor
confidence
is
the
common
consequence
of
success
they
whose
excellence
of
any
kind
has
been
loudly
celebrated
are
ready
to
conclude
that
their
powers
are
universal
pope
edition
fell
below
his
own
expectations
and
he
was
so
much
offended
when
he
was
found
to
have
left
any
thing
for
others
to
do
that
he
past
the
latter
part
of
his
life
in
a
state
of
hostility
with
verbal
criticism
i
have
retained
all
his
notes
that
no
fragment
of
so
great
a
writer
may
be
lost
his
preface
valuable
alike
for
elegance
of
composition
and
justness
of
remark
and
containing
a
general
criticism
on
his
authour
so
extensive
that
little
can
be
added
and
so
exact
that
little
can
be
disputed
every
editor
has
an
interest
to
suppress
but
that
every
reader
would
demand
its
insertion
pope
was
succeeded
by
theobald
a
man
of
narrow
comprehension
and
small
acquisitions
with
no
native
and
intrinsick
splendour
of
genius
with
little
of
the
artificial
light
of
learning
but
zealous
for
minute
accuracy
and
not
negligent
in
pursuing
it
he
collated
the
ancient
copies
and
rectified
many
errors
a
man
so
anxiously
scrupulous
might
have
been
expected
to
do
more
but
what
little
he
did
was
commonly
right
in
his
report
of
copies
and
editions
he
is
not
to
be
trusted
without
examination
he
speaks
sometimes
indefinitely
of
copies
when
he
has
only
one
in
his
enumeration
of
editions
he
mentions
the
two
first
folios
as
of
high
and
the
third
folio
as
of
middle
authority
but
the
truth
is
that
the
first
is
equivalent
to
all
others
and
that
the
rest
only
deviate
from
it
by
the
negligence
whoever
has
any
of
the
folios
has
all
excepting
those
diversities
which
mere
reiteration
of
editions
will
produce
i
collated
them
all
at
the
beginning
but
afterwards
used
only
the
first
of
his
notes
i
have
generally
retained
those
which
he
retained
himself
in
his
second
edition
except
when
they
were
confuted
by
subsequent
annotators
or
were
too
minute
to
merit
preservation
i
have
sometimes
adopted
his
restoration
of
a
comma
without
inserting
the
panegyrick
in
which
he
celebrated
himself
for
his
achievement
the
exuberant
excrescence
of
diction
i
have
often
lopped
his
triumphant
exultations
over
pope
and
rowe
i
have
sometimes
suppressed
and
his
contemptible
ostentation
i
have
frequently
concealed
but
i
have
in
some
places
shewn
him
as
he
would
have
shewn
himself
for
the
reader
diversion
that
the
inflated
emptiness
of
some
notes
may
justify
or
excuse
the
contraction
of
the
rest
theobald
thus
weak
and
ignorant
thus
mean
and
faithless
thus
petulant
and
ostentatious
by
the
good
luck
of
having
pope
for
his
enemy
has
escaped
and
escaped
alone
with
reputation
from
this
undertaking
so
willingly
does
the
world
support
those
who
solicite
favour
against
those
who
command
reverence
and
so
easily
is
he
praised
whom
no
man
can
envy
our
authour
fell
then
into
the
hands
of
sir
thomas
hanmer
the
oxford
editor
a
man
in
my
opinion
eminently
qualified
by
nature
for
such
studies
he
had
what
is
the
first
requisite
to
emendatory
criticism
that
intuition
by
which
the
poet
intention
is
immediately
discovered
and
that
dexterity
of
intellect
which
dispatches
its
work
by
the
easiest
means
he
had
undoubtedly
read
much
his
acquaintance
with
customs
opinions
and
traditions
seems
to
have
been
large
and
he
is
often
learned
without
shew
he
seldom
passes
what
he
does
not
understand
without
an
attempt
to
find
or
to
make
a
meaning
and
sometimes
hastily
makes
what
a
little
more
attention
would
have
found
he
is
solicitous
to
reduce
to
grammar
what
he
could
not
be
sure
that
his
authour
intended
to
be
grammatical
shakespeare
regarded
more
the
series
of
ideas
than
of
words
and
his
language
not
being
designed
for
the
reader
desk
was
all
that
he
desired
it
to
be
if
it
conveyed
his
meaning
to
the
audience
hanmer
care
of
the
metre
has
been
too
violently
censured
he
found
the
measures
reformed
in
so
many
passages
by
the
silent
labours
of
some
editors
with
the
silent
acquiescence
of
the
rest
that
he
thought
himself
allowed
to
extend
a
little
further
the
license
which
had
already
been
carried
so
far
without
reprehension
and
of
his
corrections
in
general
it
must
be
confessed
that
they
are
often
just
and
made
commonly
with
the
least
possible
violation
of
the
text
but
by
inserting
his
emendations
whether
invented
or
borrowed
into
the
page
without
any
notice
of
varying
copies
he
has
appropriated
the
labour
of
his
predecessors
and
made
his
own
edition
of
little
authority
his
confidence
indeed
both
in
himself
and
others
was
too
great
he
supposes
all
to
be
right
that
was
done
by
pope
and
theobald
he
seems
not
to
suspect
a
critick
of
fallibility
and
it
was
but
reasonable
that
he
should
claim
what
he
so
liberally
granted
as
he
never
writes
without
careful
enquiry
and
diligent
consideration
i
have
received
all
his
notes
and
believe
that
every
reader
will
wish
for
more
of
the
last
editor
it
is
more
difficult
to
speak
respect
is
due
to
high
place
tenderness
to
living
reputation
and
veneration
to
genius
and
learning
but
he
can
not
be
justly
offended
at
that
liberty
of
which
he
has
himself
so
frequently
given
an
example
nor
very
solicitous
what
is
thought
of
notes
which
he
ought
never
to
have
considered
as
part
of
his
serious
employments
and
which
i
suppose
since
the
ardour
of
composition
is
remitted
he
no
longer
numbers
among
his
happy
effusions
the
original
and
predominant
errour
of
his
commentary
is
acquiescence
in
his
first
thoughts
that
precipitation
which
is
produced
by
consciousness
of
quick
discernment
and
that
confidence
which
presumes
to
do
by
surveying
the
surface
what
labour
only
can
perform
by
penetrating
the
bottom
his
notes
exhibit
sometimes
perverse
interpretations
and
sometimes
improbable
conjectures
he
at
one
time
gives
the
authour
more
profundity
of
meaning
than
the
sentence
admits
and
at
another
discovers
absurdities
where
the
sense
is
plain
to
every
other
reader
but
his
emendations
are
likewise
often
happy
and
just
and
his
interpretation
of
obscure
passages
learned
and
sagacious
of
his
notes
i
have
commonly
rejected
those
against
which
the
general
voice
of
the
publick
has
exclaimed
or
which
their
own
incongruity
immediately
condemns
and
which
i
suppose
the
authour
himself
would
desire
to
be
forgotten
of
the
rest
to
part
i
have
given
the
highest
approbation
by
inserting
the
offered
reading
in
the
text
part
i
have
left
to
the
judgment
of
the
reader
as
doubtful
though
specious
and
part
i
have
censured
without
reserve
but
i
am
sure
without
bitterness
of
malice
and
i
hope
without
wantonness
of
insult
it
is
no
pleasure
to
me
in
revising
my
volumes
to
observe
how
much
paper
is
wasted
in
confutation
whoever
considers
the
revolutions
of
learning
and
the
various
questions
of
greater
or
less
importance
upon
which
wit
and
reason
have
exercised
their
powers
must
lament
the
unsuccessfulness
of
enquiry
and
the
slow
advances
of
truth
when
he
reflects
that
great
part
of
the
labour
of
every
writer
is
only
the
destruction
of
those
that
went
before
him
the
first
care
of
the
builder
of
a
new
system
is
to
demolish
the
fabricks
which
are
standing
the
chief
desire
of
him
that
comments
an
authour
is
to
shew
how
much
other
commentators
have
corrupted
and
obscured
him
the
opinions
prevalent
in
one
age
as
truths
above
the
reach
of
controversy
are
confuted
and
rejected
in
another
and
rise
again
to
reception
in
remoter
times
thus
the
human
mind
is
kept
in
motion
without
progress
thus
sometimes
truth
and
errour
and
sometimes
contrarieties
of
errour
take
each
other
place
by
reciprocal
invasion
the
tide
of
seeming
knowledge
which
is
poured
over
one
generation
retires
and
leaves
another
naked
and
barren
the
sudden
meteors
of
intelligence
which
for
a
while
appear
to
shoot
their
beams
into
the
regions
of
obscurity
on
a
sudden
withdraw
their
lustre
and
leave
mortals
again
to
grope
their
way
these
elevations
and
depressions
of
renown
and
the
contradictions
to
which
all
improvers
of
knowledge
must
for
ever
be
exposed
since
they
are
not
escaped
by
the
highest
and
brightest
of
mankind
may
surely
be
endured
with
patience
by
criticks
and
annotators
who
can
rank
themselves
but
as
the
satellites
of
their
authours
how
canst
thou
beg
for
life
says
achilles
to
his
captive
when
thou
knowest
that
thou
art
now
to
suffer
only
what
must
another
day
be
suffered
by
achilles
warburton
had
a
name
sufficient
to
confer
celebrity
on
those
who
could
exalt
themselves
into
antagonists
and
his
notes
have
raised
a
clamour
too
loud
to
be
distinct
his
chief
assailants
are
the
authours
of
the
canons
of
criticism
and
of
the
review
of
shakespeare
text
of
whom
one
ridicules
his
errours
with
airy
petulance
suitable
enough
to
the
levity
of
the
controversy
the
other
attacks
them
with
gloomy
malignity
as
if
he
were
dragging
to
justice
an
assassin
or
incendiary
the
one
stings
like
a
fly
sucks
a
little
blood
takes
a
gay
flutter
and
returns
for
more
the
other
bites
like
a
viper
and
would
be
glad
to
leave
inflammations
and
gangrene
behind
him
when
i
think
on
one
with
his
confederates
i
remember
the
danger
of
coriolanus
who
was
afraid
that
girls
with
spits
and
boys
with
stones
should
slay
him
in
puny
battle
when
the
other
crosses
my
imagination
i
remember
the
prodigy
in
macbeth
an
eagle
in
his
pride
of
place
was
by
a
mousing
owl
hawk
at
and
kill
let
me
however
do
them
justice
one
is
a
wit
and
one
a
scholar
they
have
both
shewn
acuteness
sufficient
in
the
discovery
of
faults
and
have
both
advanced
some
probable
interpretations
of
obscure
passages
but
when
they
aspire
to
conjecture
and
emendation
it
appears
how
falsely
we
all
estimate
our
own
abilities
and
the
little
which
they
have
been
able
to
perform
might
have
taught
them
more
candour
to
the
endeavours
of
others
before
warburton
edition
critical
observations
on
shakespeare
had
been
published
by
upton
a
man
skilled
in
languages
and
acquainted
with
books
but
who
seems
to
have
had
no
great
vigour
of
genius
or
nicety
of
taste
many
of
his
explanations
are
curious
and
useful
but
he
likewise
though
he
professed
to
oppose
the
licentious
confidence
of
editors
and
adhere
to
the
old
copies
is
unable
to
restrain
the
rage
of
emendation
though
his
ardour
is
ill
seconded
by
his
skill
every
cold
empirick
when
his
heart
is
expanded
by
a
successful
experiment
swells
into
a
theorist
and
the
laborious
collator
some
unlucky
moment
frolicks
in
conjecture
critical
historical
and
explanatory
notes
have
been
likewise
published
upon
shakespeare
by
grey
whose
diligent
perusal
of
the
old
english
writers
has
enabled
him
to
make
some
useful
observations
what
he
undertook
he
has
well
enough
performed
but
as
he
neither
attempts
judicial
nor
emendatory
criticism
he
employs
rather
his
memory
than
his
sagacity
it
were
to
be
wished
that
all
would
endeavour
to
imitate
his
modesty
who
have
not
been
able
to
surpass
his
knowledge
i
can
say
with
great
sincerity
of
all
my
predecessors
what
i
hope
will
hereafter
be
said
of
me
that
not
one
has
left
shakespeare
without
improvement
nor
is
there
one
to
whom
i
have
not
been
indebted
for
assistance
and
information
whatever
i
have
taken
from
them
it
was
my
intention
to
refer
to
its
original
authour
and
it
is
certain
that
what
i
have
not
given
to
another
i
believed
when
i
wrote
it
to
be
my
own
in
some
perhaps
i
have
been
anticipated
but
if
i
am
ever
found
to
encroach
upon
the
remarks
of
any
other
commentator
i
am
willing
that
the
honour
be
it
more
or
less
should
be
transferred
to
the
first
claimant
for
his
right
and
his
alone
stands
above
dispute
the
second
can
prove
his
pretensions
only
to
himself
nor
can
himself
always
distinguish
invention
with
sufficient
certainty
from
recollection
they
have
all
been
treated
by
me
with
candour
which
they
have
not
been
careful
of
observing
to
one
another
it
is
not
easy
to
discover
from
what
cause
the
acrimony
of
a
scholiast
can
naturally
proceed
the
subjects
to
be
discussed
by
him
are
of
very
small
importance
they
involve
neither
property
nor
liberty
nor
favour
the
interest
of
sect
or
party
the
various
readings
of
copies
and
different
interpretations
of
a
passage
seem
to
be
questions
that
might
exercise
the
wit
without
engaging
the
passions
but
whether
it
be
that
small
things
make
mean
men
proud
and
vanity
catches
small
occasions
or
that
all
contrariety
of
opinion
even
in
those
that
can
defend
it
no
longer
makes
proud
men
angry
there
is
often
found
in
commentaries
a
spontaneous
strain
of
invective
and
contempt
more
eager
and
venomous
than
is
vented
by
the
most
furious
controvertist
in
politicks
against
those
whom
he
is
hired
to
defame
perhaps
the
lightness
of
the
matter
may
conduce
to
the
vehemence
of
the
agency
when
the
truth
to
be
investigated
is
so
near
to
inexistence
as
to
escape
attention
its
bulk
is
to
be
enlarged
by
rage
and
exclamation
that
to
which
all
would
be
indifferent
in
its
original
state
may
attract
notice
when
the
fate
of
a
name
is
appended
to
it
a
commentator
has
indeed
great
temptations
to
supply
by
turbulence
what
he
wants
of
dignity
to
beat
his
little
gold
to
a
spacious
surface
to
work
that
to
foam
which
no
art
or
diligence
can
exalt
to
spirit
the
notes
which
i
have
borrowed
or
written
are
either
illustrative
by
which
difficulties
are
explained
or
judicial
by
which
faults
and
beauties
are
remarked
or
emendatory
by
which
depravations
are
corrected
the
explanations
transcribed
from
others
if
i
do
not
subjoin
any
other
interpretation
i
suppose
commonly
to
be
right
at
least
i
intend
by
acquiescence
to
confess
that
i
have
nothing
better
to
propose
after
the
labours
of
all
the
editors
i
found
many
passages
which
appeared
to
me
likely
to
obstruct
the
greater
number
of
readers
and
thought
it
my
duty
to
facilitate
their
passage
it
is
impossible
for
an
expositor
not
to
write
too
little
for
some
and
too
much
for
others
he
can
only
judge
what
is
necessary
by
his
own
experience
and
how
long
soever
he
may
deliberate
will
at
last
explain
many
lines
which
the
learned
will
think
impossible
to
be
mistaken
and
omit
many
for
which
the
ignorant
will
want
his
help
these
are
censures
merely
relative
and
must
be
quietly
endured
i
have
endeavoured
to
be
neither
superfluously
copious
nor
scrupulously
reserved
and
hope
that
i
have
made
my
authour
meaning
accessible
to
many
who
before
were
frighted
from
perusing
him
and
contributed
something
to
the
publick
by
diffusing
innocent
and
rational
pleasure
the
compleat
explanation
of
an
authour
not
systematick
and
consequential
but
desultory
and
vagrant
abounding
in
casual
allusions
and
light
hints
is
not
to
be
expected
from
any
single
scholiast
all
personal
reflections
when
names
are
suppressed
must
be
in
a
few
years
irrecoverably
obliterated
and
customs
too
minute
to
attract
the
notice
of
law
such
as
mode
of
dress
formalities
of
conversation
rules
of
visits
disposition
of
furniture
and
practices
of
ceremony
which
naturally
find
places
in
familiar
dialogue
are
so
fugitive
and
unsubstantial
that
they
are
not
easily
retained
or
recovered
what
can
be
known
will
be
collected
by
chance
from
the
recesses
of
obscure
and
obsolete
papers
perused
commonly
with
some
other
view
of
this
knowledge
every
man
has
some
and
none
has
much
but
when
an
authour
has
engaged
the
publick
attention
those
who
can
add
any
thing
to
his
illustration
communicate
their
discoveries
and
time
produces
what
had
eluded
diligence
to
time
i
have
been
obliged
to
resign
many
passages
which
though
i
did
not
understand
them
will
perhaps
hereafter
be
explained
having
i
hope
illustrated
some
which
others
have
neglected
or
mistaken
sometimes
by
short
remarks
or
marginal
directions
such
as
every
editor
has
added
at
his
will
and
often
by
comments
more
laborious
than
the
matter
will
seem
to
deserve
but
that
which
is
most
difficult
is
not
always
most
important
and
to
an
editor
nothing
is
a
trifle
by
which
his
authour
is
obscured
the
poetical
beauties
or
defects
i
have
not
been
very
diligent
to
observe
some
plays
have
more
and
some
fewer
judicial
observations
not
in
proportion
to
their
difference
of
merit
but
because
i
gave
this
part
of
my
design
to
chance
and
to
caprice
the
reader
i
believe
is
seldom
pleased
to
find
his
opinion
anticipated
it
is
natural
to
delight
more
in
what
we
find
or
make
than
in
what
we
receive
judgement
like
other
faculties
is
improved
by
practice
and
its
advancement
is
hindered
by
submission
to
dictatorial
decisions
as
the
memory
grows
torpid
by
the
use
of
a
table
book
some
initiation
is
however
necessary
of
all
skill
part
is
infused
by
precept
and
part
is
obtained
by
habit
i
have
therefore
shewn
so
much
as
may
enable
the
candidate
of
criticism
to
discover
the
rest
to
the
end
of
most
plays
i
have
added
short
strictures
containing
a
general
censure
of
faults
or
praise
of
excellence
in
which
i
know
not
how
much
i
have
concurred
with
the
current
opinion
but
i
have
not
by
any
affectation
of
singularity
deviated
from
it
nothing
is
minutely
and
particularly
examined
and
therefore
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
in
the
plays
which
are
condemned
there
is
much
to
be
praised
and
in
these
which
are
praised
much
to
be
condemned
the
part
of
criticism
in
which
the
whole
succession
of
editors
has
laboured
with
the
greatest
diligence
which
has
occasioned
the
most
arrogant
ostentation
and
excited
the
keenest
acrimony
is
the
emendation
of
corrupted
passages
to
which
the
publick
attention
having
been
first
drawn
by
the
violence
of
contention
between
pope
and
theobald
has
been
continued
by
the
persecution
which
with
a
kind
of
conspiracy
has
been
since
raised
against
all
the
publishers
of
shakespeare
that
many
passages
have
passed
in
a
state
of
depravation
through
all
the
editions
is
indubitably
certain
of
these
the
restoration
is
only
to
be
attempted
by
collation
of
copies
or
sagacity
of
conjecture
the
collator
province
is
safe
and
easy
the
perilous
and
difficult
yet
as
the
greater
part
of
the
plays
are
extant
only
in
one
copy
the
peril
must
not
be
avoided
nor
the
difficulty
refused
of
the
readings
which
this
emulation
of
amendment
has
hitherto
produced
some
from
the
labours
of
every
publisher
have
advanced
into
the
text
those
are
to
be
considered
as
in
my
opinion
sufficiently
supported
some
i
have
rejected
without
mention
as
evidently
erroneous
some
i
have
left
in
the
notes
without
censure
or
approbation
as
resting
in
equipoise
between
objection
and
defence
and
some
which
seemed
specious
but
not
right
i
have
inserted
with
a
subsequent
animadversion
having
classed
the
observations
of
others
i
was
at
last
to
try
what
i
could
substitute
for
their
mistakes
and
how
i
could
supply
their
omissions
i
collated
such
copies
as
i
could
procure
and
wished
for
more
but
have
not
found
the
collectors
of
these
rarities
very
communicative
of
the
editions
which
chance
or
kindness
put
into
my
hands
i
have
given
an
enumeration
that
i
may
not
be
blamed
for
neglecting
what
i
had
not
the
power
to
do
by
examining
the
old
copies
i
soon
found
that
the
late
publishers
with
all
their
boasts
of
diligence
suffered
many
passages
to
stand
unauthorised
and
contented
themselves
with
rowe
regulation
of
the
text
even
where
they
knew
it
to
be
arbitrary
and
with
a
little
consideration
might
have
found
it
to
be
wrong
some
of
these
alterations
are
only
the
ejection
of
a
word
for
one
that
appeared
to
him
more
elegant
or
more
intelligible
these
corruptions
i
have
often
silently
rectified
for
the
history
of
our
language
and
the
true
force
of
our
words
can
only
be
preserved
by
keeping
the
text
of
authours
free
from
adulteration
others
and
those
very
frequent
smoothed
the
cadence
or
regulated
the
measure
on
these
i
have
not
exercised
the
same
rigour
if
only
a
word
was
transposed
or
a
particle
inserted
or
omitted
i
have
sometimes
suffered
the
line
to
stand
for
the
inconstancy
of
the
copies
is
such
as
that
some
liberties
may
be
easily
permitted
but
this
practice
i
have
not
suffered
to
proceed
far
having
restored
the
primitive
diction
wherever
it
could
for
any
reason
be
preferred
the
emendations
which
comparison
of
copies
supplied
i
have
inserted
in
the
text
sometimes
where
the
improvement
was
slight
without
notice
and
sometimes
with
an
account
of
the
reasons
of
the
change
conjecture
though
it
be
sometimes
unavoidable
i
have
not
wantonly
nor
licentiously
indulged
it
has
been
my
settled
principle
that
the
reading
of
the
ancient
books
is
probably
true
and
therefore
is
not
to
be
disturbed
for
the
sake
of
elegance
perspicuity
or
mere
improvement
of
the
sense
for
though
much
credit
is
not
due
to
the
fidelity
nor
any
to
the
judgement
of
the
first
publishers
yet
they
who
had
the
copy
before
their
eyes
were
more
likely
to
read
it
right
than
we
who
only
read
it
by
imagination
but
it
is
evident
that
they
have
often
made
strange
mistakes
by
ignorance
or
negligence
and
that
therefore
something
may
be
properly
attempted
by
criticism
keeping
the
middle
way
between
presumption
and
timidity
such
criticism
i
have
attempted
to
practise
and
where
any
passage
appeared
inextricably
perplexed
have
endeavoured
to
discover
how
it
may
be
recalled
to
sense
with
least
violence
but
my
first
labour
is
always
to
turn
the
old
text
on
every
side
and
try
if
there
be
any
interstice
through
which
light
can
find
its
way
nor
would
huetius
himself
condemn
me
as
refusing
the
trouble
of
research
for
the
ambition
of
alteration
in
this
modest
industry
i
have
not
been
unsuccessful
i
have
rescued
many
lines
from
the
violations
of
temerity
and
secured
many
scenes
from
the
inroads
of
correction
i
have
adopted
the
roman
sentiment
that
it
is
more
honourable
to
save
a
citizen
than
to
kill
an
enemy
and
have
been
more
careful
to
protect
than
to
attack
i
have
preserved
the
common
distribution
of
the
plays
into
acts
though
i
believe
it
to
be
in
almost
all
the
plays
void
of
authority
some
of
those
which
are
divided
in
the
later
editions
have
no
division
in
the
first
folio
and
some
that
are
divided
in
the
folio
have
no
division
in
the
preceding
copies
the
settled
mode
of
the
theatre
requires
four
intervals
in
the
play
but
few
if
any
of
our
authour
compositions
can
be
properly
distributed
in
that
manner
an
act
is
so
much
of
the
drama
as
passes
without
intervention
of
time
or
change
of
place
a
pause
makes
a
new
act
in
every
real
and
therefore
in
every
imitative
action
the
intervals
may
be
more
or
fewer
the
restriction
of
five
acts
being
accidental
and
arbitrary
this
shakespeare
knew
and
this
he
practised
his
plays
were
written
and
at
first
printed
in
one
unbroken
continuity
and
ought
now
to
be
exhibited
with
short
pauses
interposed
as
often
as
the
scene
is
changed
or
any
considerable
time
is
required
to
pass
this
method
would
at
once
quell
a
thousand
absurdities
in
restoring
the
authour
works
to
their
integrity
i
have
considered
the
punctuation
as
wholly
in
my
power
for
what
could
be
their
care
of
colons
and
commas
who
corrupted
words
and
sentences
whatever
could
be
done
by
adjusting
points
is
therefore
silently
performed
in
some
plays
with
much
diligence
in
others
with
less
it
is
hard
to
keep
a
busy
eye
steadily
fixed
upon
evanescent
atoms
or
a
discursive
mind
upon
evanescent
truth
the
same
liberty
has
been
taken
with
a
few
particles
or
other
words
of
slight
effect
i
have
sometimes
inserted
or
omitted
them
without
notice
i
have
done
that
sometimes
which
the
other
editors
have
done
always
and
which
indeed
the
state
of
the
text
may
sufficiently
justify
the
greater
part
of
readers
instead
of
blaming
us
for
passing
trifles
will
wonder
that
on
mere
trifles
so
much
labour
is
expended
with
such
importance
of
debate
and
such
solemnity
of
diction
to
these
i
answer
with
confidence
that
they
are
judging
of
an
art
which
they
do
not
understand
yet
can
not
much
reproach
them
with
their
ignorance
nor
promise
that
they
would
become
in
general
by
learning
criticism
more
useful
happier
or
wiser
as
i
practised
conjecture
more
i
learned
to
trust
it
less
and
after
i
had
printed
a
few
plays
resolved
to
insert
none
of
my
own
readings
in
the
text
upon
this
caution
i
now
congratulate
myself
for
every
day
encreases
my
doubt
of
my
emendations
since
i
have
confined
my
imagination
to
the
margin
it
must
not
be
considered
as
very
reprehensible
if
i
have
suffered
it
to
play
some
freaks
in
its
own
dominion
there
is
no
danger
in
conjecture
if
it
be
proposed
as
conjecture
and
while
the
text
remains
uninjured
those
changes
may
be
safely
offered
which
are
not
considered
even
by
him
that
offers
them
as
necessary
or
safe
if
my
readings
are
of
little
value
they
have
not
been
ostentatiously
displayed
or
importunately
obtruded
i
could
have
written
longer
notes
for
the
art
of
writing
notes
is
not
of
difficult
attainment
the
work
is
performed
first
by
railing
at
the
stupidity
negligence
ignorance
and
asinine
tastelessness
of
the
former
editors
and
shewing
from
all
that
goes
before
and
all
that
follows
the
inelegance
and
absurdity
of
the
old
reading
then
by
proposing
something
which
to
superficial
readers
would
seem
specious
but
which
the
editor
rejects
with
indignation
then
by
producing
the
true
reading
with
a
long
paraphrase
and
concluding
with
loud
acclamations
on
the
discovery
and
a
sober
wish
for
the
advancement
and
prosperity
of
genuine
criticism
all
this
may
be
done
and
perhaps
done
sometimes
without
impropriety
but
i
have
always
suspected
that
the
reading
is
right
which
requires
many
words
to
prove
it
wrong
and
the
emendation
wrong
that
can
not
without
so
much
labour
appear
to
be
right
the
justness
of
a
happy
restoration
strikes
at
once
and
the
moral
precept
may
be
well
applied
to
criticism
quod
dubitas
ne
feceris
to
dread
the
shore
which
he
sees
spread
with
wrecks
is
natural
to
the
sailor
i
had
before
my
eye
so
many
critical
adventures
ended
in
miscarriage
that
caution
was
forced
upon
me
i
encountered
in
every
page
wit
struggling
with
its
own
sophistry
and
learning
confused
by
the
multiplicity
of
its
views
i
was
forced
to
censure
those
whom
i
admired
and
could
not
but
reflect
while
i
was
dispossessing
their
emenations
how
soon
the
same
fate
might
happen
to
my
own
and
how
many
of
the
readings
which
i
have
corrected
may
be
some
other
editor
defended
and
established
criticks
i
saw
that
other
names
efface
and
fix
their
own
with
labour
in
the
place
their
own
like
others
soon
their
place
resign
or
disappear
and
left
the
first
pope
that
a
conjectural
critick
should
often
be
mistaken
can
not
be
wonderful
either
to
others
or
himself
if
it
be
considered
that
in
his
art
there
is
no
system
no
principal
and
axiomatical
truth
that
regulates
subordinate
positions
his
chance
of
errour
is
renewed
at
every
attempt
an
oblique
view
of
the
passage
a
slight
misapprehension
of
a
phrase
a
casual
inattention
to
the
parts
connected
is
sufficient
to
make
him
not
only
fail
but
fail
ridiculously
and
when
he
succeeds
best
he
produces
perhaps
but
one
reading
of
many
probable
and
he
that
suggests
another
will
always
be
able
to
dispute
his
claims
it
is
an
unhappy
state
in
which
danger
is
hid
under
pleasure
the
allurements
of
emendation
are
scarcely
resistible
conjecture
has
all
the
joy
and
all
the
pride
of
invention
and
he
that
has
once
started
a
happy
change
is
too
much
delighted
to
consider
what
objections
may
rise
against
it
yet
conjectural
criticism
has
been
of
great
use
in
the
learned
world
nor
is
it
my
intention
to
depreciate
a
study
that
has
exercised
so
many
mighty
minds
from
the
revival
of
learning
to
our
own
age
from
the
bishop
of
aleria
to
english
bentley
the
criticks
on
ancient
authours
have
in
the
exercise
of
their
sagacity
many
assistances
which
the
editor
of
shakespeare
is
condemned
to
want
they
are
employed
upon
grammatical
and
settled
languages
whose
construction
contributes
so
much
to
perspicuity
that
homer
has
fewer
passages
unintelligible
than
chaucer
the
words
have
not
only
a
known
regimen
but
invariable
quantities
which
direct
and
confine
the
choice
there
are
commonly
more
manuscripts
than
one
and
they
do
not
often
conspire
in
the
same
mistakes
yet
scaliger
could
confess
to
salmasius
how
little
satisfaction
his
emendations
gave
him
illudunt
nobis
conjecturae
nostrae
quarum
nos
pudet
posteaquam
in
meliores
cofices
incidimus
and
lipsius
could
complain
that
criticks
were
making
faults
by
trying
to
remove
them
ut
olim
vitiis
ita
nunc
remediis
laboratur
and
indeed
where
mere
conjecture
is
to
be
used
the
emendations
of
scaliger
and
lipsius
notwithstanding
their
wonderful
sagacity
and
erudition
are
often
vague
and
disputable
like
mine
or
theobald
perhaps
i
may
not
be
more
censured
for
doing
wrong
than
for
doing
little
for
raising
in
the
publick
expectations
which
at
last
i
have
not
answered
the
expectation
of
ignorance
is
indefinite
and
that
of
knowledge
is
often
tyrannical
it
is
hard

what

who

by

what
they
think
impossible
to

i
have
indeed
disappointed
no
opinion
more
than
my
own
yet
i
have
endeavoured
to
perform
my
task
with
no
slight
solicitude
not
a
single
passage
in
the
whole
work
has
appeared
to
me
corrupt
which
i
have
not
attempted
to
restore
or
obscure
which
i
have
not
endeavoured
to
illustrate
in
many
i
have
failed
like
others
and
from
many
after
all
my
efforts
i
have
retreated
and
confessed
the
repulse
i
have
not
passed
over
with
affected
superiority
what
is
equally
difficult
to
the
reader
and
to
myself
but
where
i
could
not
instruct
him
have
owned
my
ignorance
i
might
easily
have
accumulated
a
mass
of
seeming
learning
upon
easy
scenes
but
it
ought
not
to
be
imputed
to
negligence
that
where
nothing
was
necessary
nothing
has
been
done
or
that
where
others
have
said
enough
i
have
said
no
more
notes
are
often
necessary
but
they
are
necessary
evils
let
him
that
is
yet
unacquainted
with
the
powers
of
shakespeare
and
who
desires
to
feel
the
highest
pleasure
that
the
drama
can
give
read
every
play
from
the
first
scene
to
the
last
with
utter
negligence
of
all
his
commentators
when
his
fancy
is
once
on
the
wing
let
it
not
stoop
at
correction
or
explanation
when
his
attention
is
strongly
engaged
let
it
disdain
alike
to
turn
aside
to
the
name
of
theobald
and
pope
let
him
read
on
through
brightness
and
obscurity
through
integrity
and
corruption
let
him
preserve
his
comprehension
of
the
dialogue
and
his
interest
in
the
fable
and
when
the
pleasures
of
novelty
have
ceased
let
him
attempt
exactness
and
read
the
commentators
particular
passages
are
cleared
by
notes
but
the
general
effect
of
the
work
is
weakened
the
mind
is
refrigerated
by
interruption
the
thoughts
are
diverted
from
the
principal
subject
the
reader
is
weary
he
suspects
not
why
and
at
last
throws
away
the
book
which
he
has
too
diligently
studied
parts
are
not
to
be
examined
till
the
whole
has
been
surveyed
there
is
a
kind
of
intellectual
remoteness
necessary
for
the
comprehension
of
any
great
work
in
its
full
design
and
its
true
proportions
a
close
approach
shews
the
smaller
niceties
but
the
beauty
of
the
whole
is
discerned
no
longer
it
is
not
very
grateful
to
consider
how
little
the
succession
of
editors
has
added
to
this
authour
power
of
pleasing
he
was
read
admired
studied
and
imitated
while
he
was
yet
deformed
with
all
the
improprieties
which
ignorance
and
neglect
could
accumulate
upon
him
while
the
reading
was
yet
not
rectified
nor
his
allusions
understood
yet
then
did
dryden
pronounce
that
shakespeare
was
the
man
who
of
all
modern
and
perhaps
ancient
poets
had
the
largest
and
most
comprehensive
soul
all
the
images
of
nature
were
still
present
to
him
and
he
drew
them
not
laboriously
but
luckily
when
he
describes
any
thing
you
more
than
see
it
you
feel
it
too
those
who
accuse
him
to
have
wanted
learning
give
him
the
greater
commendation
he
was
naturally
learned
he
needed
not
the
spectacles
of
books
to
read
nature
he
looked
inwards
and
found
her
there
i
can
not
say
he
is
every
where
alike
were
he
so
i
should
do
him
injury
to
compare
him
with
the
greatest
of
mankind
he
is
many
times
flat
and
insipid
his
comick
wit
degenerating
into
clenches
his
serious
swelling
into
bombast
but
he
is
always
great
when
some
great
occasion
is
presented
to
him
no
man
can
say
he
ever
had
a
fit
subject
for
his
wit
and
did
not
then
raise
himself
as
high
above
the
rest
of
poets
quantum
lenta

inter

it
is
to
be
lamented
that
such
a
writer
should
want
a
commentary
that
his
language
should
become
obsolete
or
his
sentiments
obscure
but
it
is
vain
to
carry
wishes
beyond
the
condition
of
human
things
that
which
must
happen
to
all
has
happened
to
shakespeare
by
accident
and
time
and
more
than
has
been
suffered
by
any
other
writer
since
the
use
of
types
has
been
suffered
by
him
through
his
own
negligence
of
fame
or
perhaps
by
that
superiority
of
mind
which
despised
its
own
performances
when
it
compared
them
with
its
powers
and
judged
those
works
unworthy
to
be
preserved
which
the
criticks
of
following
ages
were
to
contend
for
the
fame
of
restoring
and
explaining
among
these
candidates
of
inferiour
fame
i
am
now
to
stand
the
judgment
of
the
publick
and
wish
that
i
could
confidently
produce
my
commentary
as
equal
to
the
encouragement
which
i
have
had
the
honour
of
receiving
every
work
of
this
kind
is
by
its
nature
deficient
and
i
should
feel
little
solicitude
about
the
sentence
were
it
to
be
pronounced
only
by
the
skilful
and
the
learned
selected
notes
from
some
of
the
plays
measure
for
measure
there
is
perhaps
not
one
of
shakespeare
plays
more
darkened
than
this

the
peculiarities
of
its

the
unskilfulness
of
its

distortions

no
more
remains

that

is
a
passage
which
has
exercised
the
sagacity
of
the
editors

is
now
to
employ
mine
sir
tho
hanmer
having
caught
from
theobald
a
hint
that
a

was
lost
endeavours
to
supply
it
thus
then
no
more
remains
but
that
to
your
sufficiency
you
join
a
will
to
serve
us
as
your
worth
is
able
he
has
by
this
bold
conjecture
undoubtedly
obtained
a
meaning
but
perhaps
not
even
in
his
own
opinion
the
meaning
of
shakespeare
that
the
passage
is
more
or
less
corrupt
i
believe
every
reader
will
agree
with
the
editors
i
am
not
convinced
that
a
line
is
lost
as
theobald
conjectures
nor
that
the
change

to
put
which
warburton
has
admitted
after
some
other
editor
will
amend
the
fault
there
was
probably
some
original
obscurity
in
the
expression
which
gave
occasion
to
mistake
in
repetition
or
transcription
i
therefore
suspect
that
the
authour
wrote
thus
then
no
more
remains
but
that
to
your
sufficiencies
your
worth
is
abled
and
let
them
work
then
nothing
remains
more
than
to
tell
you
that
your
virtue
is
now
invested
with
power
equal
to
your
knowledge

wisdom
let
therefore
your
knowledge
and
your
virtue
now
work
together
it
may
easily
be
conceived
how

by
an
inarticulate
speaker
or
inattentive
hearer
confounded
with
sufficiency
as
and
how
abled
a
word
very
unusual
was
changed
into
able
for

however
an
authority
is
not
wanting

uses
it

solicits

sincerity

his
deeds

did
look
on

since
it
is
so
let
him
not
die
that
angelo
had
committed
all
the
crimes
charged
against
him
as
far
as
he
could
commit
them
is
evident
the
only
intent
which
his
act
did
not
overtake
was
the
defilement
of
isabel
of
this

only
intentionally
guilty
angelo
crimes
were
such
as
must
sufficiently
justify
punishment
whether
its
end
be
to
secure
the
innocent
from
wrong
or
to
deter
guilt
by
example
and
i
believe
every
reader
feels
some
indignation
when
he
finds
him
spared
from
what
extenuation
of
his
crime
can
isabel
who
yet
supposes

our
varlet
poet
intended
to
inculcate
that
women
think
ill

nothing

raises
the
credit

ready
however
virtuous
to
pardon

it
is
somewhat
strange
that

either
gratitude
wonder
or
joy
at
the
sight
of
her
brother
after
the
pardon
of
two
murderers
lucio
might
be
treated
by
the
good
duke
with
less
harshness
but
perhaps
the
poet
intended
to
show
what
is
too
often
seen
that
men
easily
forgive
wrongs
which
are
not
committed
against
themselves
the
novel
of
cynthio
giraldi
from
which
shakespeare
is
supposed
to
have
borrowed
this
fable
may
be
read
in
shakespeare
illustrated
elegantly
translated
with
remarks
which
will
assist
the
enquirer
to
discover
how
much
absurdity
shakespeare
has
admitted
or
avoided
i
can
not
but
suspect
that
some
other
had
new
modelled
the
novel
of
cynthio
or
written
a
story
which
in
some
particulars
resembled
it
and
that
cinthio
was
not

authour
whom
shakespeare
immediately
followed

emperour
in
cinthio
is
named
maximine
the
duke
in
shakespeare
enumeration
of
the
persons
of
the
drama
is
called
vincentio
this
appears
a
very
slight
remark
but
since
the
duke
has
no
name
in
the
play
nor
is
ever
mentioned
but
by
his
title
why
should
he
be
called
vincentio
among
the
persons
but
because
the
name
was
copied
from
the
story
and
placed
superfluously
at
the
head
of
the
list
by
the
mere
habit
of
transcription
it
is
therefore
likely
that
there
was
then
a
story
of
vincentio
duke
of
vienna
different
from
that
of
maximine
emperour
of
the
romans
of
this
play
the
light

comick
part

very
natural

pleasing

the
grave

more

falstaff

unimitable
falstaff
how
shall
i
describe
thee
thou
compound
of
sense
and
vice
of
sense
which
may
be
admired
but
not
esteemed
of
vice
which
may
be
despised
but
hardly
detested
falstaff
is
a
character
loaded
with
faults
and
with
those
faults
which
naturally
produce
contempt
he
is
a
thief
and
a
glutton
a
coward
and
a
boaster
always
ready
to
cheat
the
weak
and
prey
upon
the
poor
to
terrify
the
timorous
and
insult
the
defenceless
at
once
obsequious
and
malignant
he
satirises
in
their
absence
those
whom
he
lives
by
flattering
he
is
familiar
with
the
prince
only
as
an
agent
of
vice
but
of
this
familiarity
he
is
so
proud
as
not
only
to
be
supercilious
and
haughty
with
common
men
but
to
think
his
interest
of
importance
to
the
duke
of
lancaster
yet
the
man
thus
corrupt
thus
despicable
makes
himself
necessary
to
the
prince
that
despises
him
by
the
most
pleasing
of
all
qualities
perpetual
gaiety
by
an
unfailing
power
of
exciting
laughter
which
is
the
more
freely
indulged
as
his
wit
is
not
of
the
splendid
or
ambitious
kind
but
consists
in
easy
escapes
and
sallies
of
levity
which
make
sport
but
raise
no
envy
it
must
be
observed
that
he
is
stained
with
no
enormous
or
sanguinary
crimes
so
that
his
licentiousness
is
not
so
offensive
but
that
it
may
be
borne
for
his
mirth
the
moral
to
be
drawn
from
this
representation
is
that
no
man
is
more
dangerous
than
he
that
with
a
will
to
corrupt
hath
the
power
to
please
and
that
neither
wit
nor
honesty
ought
to
think
themselves
safe
with
such
a
companion
when
they
see
henry
seduced
by
falstaff

cold
as
any
stone
such
is
the
end
of
falstaff
from
whom
shakespeare
had
promised
us
in
his
epilogue
to
henry
iv
that
we
should
receive
more
entertainment
it
happened
to
shakespeare
as
to
other
writers
to
have
his
imagination
crowded
with
a
tumultuary
confusion
of
images
which
while
they
were
yet
unsorted
and
unexamined
seemed
sufficient
to
furnish
a
long
train
of
incidents
and
a
new
variety
of
merriment
but
which
when
he
was
to
produce
them
to
view
shrunk
suddenly
from
him
or
could
not
be
accommodated
to
his
general
design
that
he
once
designed
to
have
brought
falstaff
on
the
scene
again
we
know
from
himself
but
whether
he
could
contrive
no
train
of
adventures
suitable
to
his
character
or
could
match
him
with
no
companions
likely
to
quicken
his
humour
or
could
open
no
new
vein
of
pleasantry
and
was
afraid
to
continue
the
same
strain
lest
it
should
not
find
the
same
reception
he
has
here
for
ever
discarded
him
and
made
haste
to
dispatch
him
perhaps
for
the
same
reason
for
which
addison
killed
sir
roger
that
no
other
hand
might
attempt
to
exhibit
him
let
meaner
authours
learn
from
this
example
that
it
is
dangerous
to
sell
the
bear
which
is
yet
not
hunted
to
promise
to
the
publick
what
they
have
not
written
king
lear
the
tragedy
of
lear
is
deservedly
celebrated
among
the
dramas
of
shakespeare
there
is
perhaps
no
play
which
keeps
the
attention
so
strongly
fixed
which
so
much
agitates
our
passions
and
interests
our
curiosity
the
artful
involutions
of
distinct
interests
the
striking
opposition
of
contrary
characters
the
sudden
changes
of
fortune
and
the
quick
succession
of
events
fill
the
mind
with
a
perpetual
tumult
of
indignation
pity
and
hope
there
is
no
scene
which
does
not
contribute
to
the
aggravation
of
the
distress
or
conduct
of
the
action
and
scarce
a
line
which
does
not
conduce
to
the
progress
of
the
scene
so
powerful
is
the
current
of
the
poet
imagination
that
the
mind
which
once
ventures
within
it
is
hurried
irresistibly
along
on
the
seeming
improbability
of
lear
conduct
it
may
be
observed
that
he
is
represented
according
to
histories
at
that
time
vulgarly
received
as
true
and
perhaps
if
we
turn
our
thoughts
upon
the
barbarity
and
ignorance
of
the
age
to
which
this
story
is
referred
it
will
appear
not
so
unlikely
as
while
we
estimate
lear
manners
by
our
own
such
preference
of
one
daughter
to
another
or
resignation
of
dominion
on
such
conditions
would
be
yet
credible
if
told
of
a
petty
prince
of
guinea
or
madagascar
shakespeare
indeed
by
the
mention
of
his
earls
and
dukes
has
given
us
the
idea
of
times
more
civilised
and
of
life
regulated
by
softer
manners
and
the
truth
that
though
he
so
nicely
discriminates
and
so
minutely
describes
the
characters
of
men
he
commonly
neglects
and
confounds
the
characters
of
ages
by
mingling
customs
ancient
and
modern
english
and
foreign
my
learned
friend
warton
who
has
in
the
adventurer
very
minutely
criticised
this
play
remarks
that
the
instances
of
cruelty
are
too
savage
and
shocking
and
that
the
intervention
of
edmund
destroys
the
simplicity
of
the
story
these
objections
may
i
think
be
answered
by
repeating
that
the
cruelty
of
the
daughters
is
an
historical
fact
to
which
the
poet
has
added
little
having
only
drawn
it
into
a
series
by
dialogue
and
action
but
i
am
not
able
to
apologise
with
equal
plausibility
for
the
extrusion
of
eyes
which
seems
an
act
too
horrid
to
be
endured
in
dramatick
exhibition
and
such
as
must
always
compel
the
mind
to
relieve
its
distress
by
incredulity
yet
let
it
be
remembered
that
our
authour
well
knew
what
would
please
the
audience
for
which
he
wrote
the
injury
done
by
edmund
to
the
simplicity
of
the
action
is
abundantly
recompensed
by
the
addition
of
variety
by
the
art
with
which
he
is
made
to
with
the
chief
design
and
the
opportunity
which
he
gives
the
poet
of
combining
perfidy
with
perfidy
and
connecting
the
wicked
son
with
the
wicked
daughters
to
impress
this
important
moral
that
villany
is
never
at
a
stop
that
crimes
lead
to
crimes
and
at
last
terminate
in
ruin
but
though
this
moral
be
incidentally
enforced
shakespeare
has
suffered
the
virtue
of
cordelia
to
perish
in
a
just
cause
contrary
to
the
natural
ideas
of
justice
to
the
hope
of
the
reader
and
what
is
yet
more
strange
to
the
faith
of
chronicles
yet
this
conduct
is
justified
by
the
spectator
who
blames
tate
for
giving
cordelia
success
and
happiness
in
his
alteration
and
declares
that
in
his
opinion
the
tragedy
has
lost
half
its
beauty
dennis
has
remarked
whether
justly
or
not
that
to
secure
the
favourable
reception
of
cato
the
town
was
poisoned
with
much
false
and
abominable
criticism
and
that
endeavours
had
been
used
to
discredit
and
decry
poetical
justice
a
play
in
which
the
wicked
prosper
and
the
virtuous
miscarry
may
doubtless
be
good
because
it
is
a
just
representation
of
the
common
events
of
human
life
but
since
all
reasonable
beings
naturally
love
justice
i
can
not
easily
be
persuaded
that
the
observation
of
justice
makes
a
play
worse
or
that
if
other
excellencies
are
equal
the
audience
will
not
always
rise
better
pleased
from
the
final
triumph
of
persecuted
virtue
in
the
present
case
the
publick
has
decided
cordelia
from
the
time
of
tate
has
always
retired
with
victory
and
felicity

if
my
sensations
could
add
any
thing
to
the
general
suffrage
i
might
relate
that

will

it
is
much
to

avoid
a
narrative
of
events
which
the
audience
already
knew

is
one
of
the
most
pleasing
of
our
performances

numerous
and

catastrophe
irresistably
affecting

the
process
of
the
action
carried
on
with
such
probability
at
least
with
such
congruity
to
popular
opinions
as
tragedy
requires
here
is
one
of
the
few
attempts
of
shakespeare
to
exhibit
the
conversation
of
gentlemen
to
represent
the
airy
sprightliness
of
juvenile
elegance
dryden
mentions
a
tradition
which
might
easily
reach
his
time
of
a
declaration
made
by
shakespeare
that
he
was
obliged
to
kill
mercutio
in
the
third
act
lest
he
should
have
been
killed
by
him
yet
he
thinks
him
no
such
formidable
person
but
that
he
might
have
lived
through
the
play
and
died
in
his
bed
without
danger
to
a
poet
dryden
well
knew
had
he
been
in
quest
of
truth
that
in
a
pointed
sentence
more
regard
is
commonly
had
to
the
word
than
the
thought
and
that
it
is
very
seldom
to
be
rigorously
understood
mercutio
wit
gaiety
and
courage
will
always
procure
him
friends
that
wish
him
a
longer
life
but
his
death
is
not
precipitated
he
has
lived
out
the
time
allotted
him
in
the
construction
of
the
play
nor
do
i
doubt
the
ability
of
shakespeare
to
have
continued
his
existence
though
some
of
his
sallies
are
perhaps
out
of
the
reach
of
dryden
whose
genius
was
not
very
fertile
of
merriment
nor
ductile
to
humour
but
acute
argumentative
comprehensive
and
sublime
the
nurse
is
one
of
the
characters

the
authour
delighted

subtility

is

man
bred
in
courts
exercised
in
business
stored
with
observation
confident
of
his
knowledge
proud
of
his
eloquence
and
declining
into
dotage
his
mode
of
oratory
is
truly
represented
as
designed
to
ridicule
the
practice
of
those
times
of
prefaces
that
made
no
introduction
and
of
method
that
embarrassed
rather
than
explained
this
part
of
his
character
is
accidental
the
rest
is
natural
such
a
man
is
positive
and
confident
because
he
knows
that
his
mind
was
once
strong
and
knows
not
that
it
is
become
weak
such
a
man
excels
in
general
principles
but
fails
in
the
particular
application
he
is
knowing
in
retrospect
and
ignorant
in
foresight
while
he
depends
upon
his
memory
and
can
draw
from
his
repositories
of
knowledge
he
utters
weighty
sentences
and
gives
useful
counsel
but
as
the
mind
in
its
enfeebled
state
can
not
be
kept
long
busy
and
intent
the
old
man
is
subject
to
sudden
dereliction
of
his
faculties
he
loses
the
order
of
his
ideas
and
entangles
himself
in
his
own
thoughts
till
he
recovers
the
leading
principle
and
falls
again
into
his
former
train
this
idea
of
dotage
encroaching
upon
wisdom
will
solve
all
the
phenomena

the
character

of
life
and
particular
modes
of
conversation
the
pretended
madness
of
hamlet
causes
much
mirth
the
mournful
distraction
of
ophelia
fills
the
heart
with
tenderness
and
every
personage
produces
the
effect
intended
from
the
apparition
that
in
the
first
act
chills
the
blood
with
horror
to
the
fop
in
the
last
that
exposes
affectation
to
just
contempt
the
conduct
is
perhaps
not
wholly
secure
against
objections
the
action
is
indeed
for
the
most
part
in
continual
progression
but
there
are
some
scenes
which
neither
forward
nor
retard
it
of
the
feigned
madness
of
hamlet
there
appears
no
adequate
cause
for
he
does
nothing
which
he
might
not
have
done
with
the
reputation
of
sanity
he
plays
the
madman
most
when
he
treats
ophelia
with
so
much
rudeness
which
seems
to
be
useless
and
wanton
cruelty
hamlet
is
through
the
whole
play
rather
an
instrument
than
an
agent
after
he
has
by
the
stratagem
of
the
play
convicted
the
king
he
makes
no
attempt
to
punish
him
and
his
death
is
at
last
effected
by
an
incident
which
hamlet
has
no
part
in
producing
the
catastrophe
is
not
very
happily
produced
the
exchange
of
weapons
is
rather
an
expedient
of
necessity
than
a
stroke
of
art
a
scheme
might
easily
have
been
formed
to
kill
hamlet
with
the
dagger
and
laertes
with
the
bowl
the
poet
is
accused
of
having
shewn
little
regard
to
poetical
justice
and
may
be
charged
with
equal
neglect
of
poetical
probability
the
apparition
left
the
regions
of
the
dead
to
little
purpose
the
revenge
which
he
demands
is
not
obtained
but
by
the
death
of
him
that
was
required
to
take
it
and
the
gratification
which
would
arise
from
the
destruction
of
an
usurper
and
a
murderer
is
abated
by
the
untimely
death
of
ophelia
the
young
the
beautiful
the
harmless
and
the
pious
othello
act
scene
vi
ii
oh
perjur
woman
thou
dost
stone
my
heart
and
me
call
what
i
intent
to
do
a
murder
which
i
thought
a
sacrifice
this
line
is
difficult
thou
hast
harden
my
heart
and
makest
me
kill
thee
with
the
rage
of
a
murderer
when
i
thought
to
have
sacraficed
thee
to
justice
with
the
calmness
of
a
priest
striking
a
victim
it
must
not
be
omitted
that
one
of
the
elder
quarto
reads
thou
dost
stone
thy
heart
which
i
suspect
to
be
genuine
the
meaning
then
will
be
thou
forcest
me
to
dismiss
thee
from
the
world
in
the
state
of
the
murdered
without
preparation
for
death
when
i
intended
that
thy
punishment
should
have
been
a
sacrifice
atoning
for
thy
crime
i
am
glad
that
i
have
ended
my
revisal
of
this
dreadful
scene
it
is
not
to
be
endured
the
beauties
of
this
play
impress
themselves
so
strongly
upon
the
attention
of
the
reader
that
they
can
draw
no
aid
from
critical
illustration
the
fiery
openness
of
othello
magnanimous
artless
and
credulous
boundless
in
his
confidence
ardent
in
his
affection
inflexible
in
his
resolution
and
obdurate
in
his
revenge
the
cool
malignity
of
iago
silent
in
his
resentment
subtle
in
his
designs
and
studious
at
once
of
his
interest
and
his
vengeance
the
soft
simplicity
of
desdemona
confident
of
merit
and
conscious
of
innocence
her
artless
perseverance
in
her
suit
and
her
slowness
to
suspect
that
she
can
be
suspected
are
such
proofs
of
skill
in
human
nature
as
i
suppose
it
is
vain
to
seek
in
any
modern
writer
the
gradual
progress
which
iago
makes
in
the
conviction
and
the
circumstances
which
he
employs
to
inflame
him
are
so
artfully
natural
that
though
it
will
perhaps
not
be
said
of
him
as
he
says
of
himself
that
he
is
a
man
not
esily
jealous
yet
we
can
not
but
pity
him
when
at
last
we
find
him
perplexed
in
the
extreme
there
is
always
danger
lest
wickedness
conjoined
with
abilities
should
steal
upon
esteem
though
it
misses
of
approbation
but
the
character
if
iago
is
so
conducted
that
he
is
from
the
first
scene
to
the
last
hated
and
despised
event
he
inferiour
characters
of
this
play
would
be
very
conspicuous
in
any
other
piece
not
only
for
their
justness
but
their
strength
cassio
is
brave
benevolent
and
honest
ruined
only
by
his
want
of
stubbornness
to
resist
an
insidious
invitation
of
suspicious
credulity
and
impatient
submission
of
the
cheats
which
he
sees
practised
upon
him
and
which
by
persuasion
he
suffers
to
be
repeated
exhibit
a
strong
picture
of
a
weak
mind
betrayed
by
unlawful
desires
to
a
false
friend
and
the
virtue
of
aemilia
is
such
as
we
often
find
worn
loosely
but
not
cast
off
easy
to
commit
small
crimes
but
quickend
and
alarmed
at
atrocious
villanies
the
scenes
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
are
busy
varied
but
happy
interchanges
and
regularly
promoting
the
progression
of
the
story
and
the
narrative
in
the
end
though
it
tells
but
what
is
known
already
yet
is
necessary
to
produce
the
death
of
othello
had
the
scene
opened
in
cyprus
and
the
preceding
incidents
been
occasionally
related
there
had
been
little
wanting
of
a
drama
of
the
most
exact
and
scrupulous
regularity
