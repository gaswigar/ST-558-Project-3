house
trottle
report
let
at
last
over
the
way
i
had
been
living
at
tunbridge
wells
and
nowhere
else
going
on
for
ten
years
when
my
medical
man
very
clever
in
his
profession
and
the
prettiest
player
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
of
a
hand
at
long
whist
which
was
a
noble
and
a
princely
game
before
short
was
heard
of
said
to
me
one
day
as
he
sat
feeling
my
pulse
on
the
actual
sofa
which
my
poor
dear
sister
jane
worked
before
her
spine
came
on
and
laid
her
on
a
board
for
fifteen
months
at
a
stretch
the
most
upright
woman
that
ever
lived
said
to
me
what
we
want
is
a
fillip
good
gracious
goodness
gracious
doctor
towers
says
i
quite
startled
at
the
man
for
he
was
so
christened
himself
do
talk
as
if
you
were
alluding
to
people
names
but
say
what
you
mean
i
mean
my
dear
that
we
want
a
little
change
of
air
and
scene
bless
the
man
said
i
does
he
mean
we
or
me
i
mean
you
then
lard
forgive
you
doctor
towers
i
said
why
do
you
get
into
a
habit
of
expressing
yourself
in
a
straightforward
manner
like
a
loyal
subject
of
our
gracious
queen
victoria
and
a
member
of
the
church
of
england
towers
laughed
as
he
generally
does
when
he
has
fidgetted
me
into
any
of
my
impatient
ways
one
of
my
states
as
i
call
them
and
then
he
began
tone
tone
is
all
you
require
he
appealed
to
trottle
who
just
then
came
in
with
the
looking
in
his
nice
black
suit
like
an
amiable
man
putting
on
coals
from
motives
of
benevolence
trottle
whom
i
always
call
my
right
hand
has
been
in
my
service
thirty
years
he
entered
my
service
far
away
from
england
he
is
the
best
of
creatures
and
the
most
respectable
of
men
but
opinionated
what
you
want
says
trottle
making
up
the
fire
in
his
quiet
and
skilful
way
is
tone
lard
forgive
you
both
says
i
bursting
out
i
see
you
are
in
a
conspiracy
against
me
so
i
suppose
you
must
do
what
you
like
with
me
and
take
me
to
london
for
a
change
for
some
weeks
towers
had
hinted
at
london
and
consequently
i
was
prepared
for
him
when
we
had
got
to
this
point
we
got
on
so
expeditiously
that
trottle
was
packed
off
to
london
next
day
but
one
to
find
some
sort
of
place
for
me
to
lay
my
troublesome
old
head
in
trottle
came
back
to
me
at
the
wells
after
two
days
absence
with
accounts
of
a
charming
place
that
could
be
taken
for
six
months
certain
with
liberty
to
renew
on
the
same
terms
for
another
six
and
which
really
did
afford
every
accommodation
that
i
wanted
could
you
really
find
no
fault
at
all
in
the
rooms
trottle
i
asked
him
not
a
single
one
they
are
exactly
suitable
to
you
there
is
not
a
fault
in
them
there
is
but
one
fault
outside
of
them
and
what
that
they
are
opposite
a
house
to
let
o
i
said
considering
of
it
but
is
that
such
a
very
great
objection
i
think
it
my
duty
to
mention
it
it
is
a
dull
object
to
look
at
otherwise
i
was
so
greatly
pleased
with
the
lodging
that
i
should
have
closed
with
the
terms
at
once
as
i
had
your
authority
to
do
trottle
thinking
so
highly
of
the
place
in
my
interest
i
wished
not
to
disappoint
him
consequently
i
said
the
empty
house
may
let
perhaps
o
dear
no
said
trottle
shaking
his
head
with
decision
it
wo
let
it
never
does
let
mercy
me
why
not
nobody
knows
all
i
have
to
mention
is
that
the
house
wo
let
how
long
has
this
unfortunate
house
been
to
let
in
the
name
of
fortune
said
i
ever
so
long
said
trottle
years
is
it
in
ruins
it
a
good
deal
out
of
repair
but
it
not
in
ruins
the
long
and
the
short
of
this
business
was
that
next
day
i
had
a
pair
of
put
to
my
chariot
for
i
never
travel
by
railway
not
that
i
have
anything
to
say
against
railways
except
that
they
came
in
when
i
was
too
old
to
take
to
them
and
that
they
made
ducks
and
drakes
of
a
few
i
had
and
so
i
went
up
myself
with
trottle
in
the
rumble
to
look
at
the
inside
of
this
same
lodging
and
at
the
outside
of
this
same
house
as
i
say
i
went
and
saw
for
myself
the
lodging
was
perfect
that
i
was
sure
it
would
be
because
trottle
is
the
best
judge
of
comfort
i
know
the
empty
house
was
an
eyesore
and
that
i
was
sure
it
would
be
too
for
the
same
reason
however
setting
the
one
thing
against
the
other
the
good
against
the
bad
the
lodging
very
soon
got
the
victory
over
the
house
my
lawyer
mr
squares
of
crown
office
row
temple
drew
up
an
agreement
which
his
young
man
jabbered
over
so
dreadfully
when
he
read
it
to
me
that
i
did
understand
one
word
of
it
except
my
own
name
and
hardly
that
and
i
signed
it
and
the
other
party
signed
it
and
in
three
weeks
time
i
moved
my
old
bones
bag
and
baggage
up
to
london
for
the
first
month
or
so
i
arranged
to
leave
trottle
at
the
wells
i
made
this
arrangement
not
only
because
there
was
a
good
deal
to
take
care
of
in
the
way
of
my
and
pensioners
and
also
of
a
new
stove
in
the
hall
to
air
the
house
in
my
absence
which
appeared
to
me
calculated
to
blow
up
and
burst
but
likewise
because
i
suspect
trottle
though
the
steadiest
of
men
and
a
widower
between
sixty
and
seventy
to
be
what
i
call
rather
a
philanderer
i
mean
that
when
any
friend
comes
down
to
see
me
and
brings
a
maid
trottle
is
always
remarkably
ready
to
show
that
maid
the
wells
of
an
evening
and
that
i
have
more
than
once
noticed
the
shadow
of
his
arm
outside
the
room
door
nearly
opposite
my
chair
encircling
that
maid
waist
on
the
landing
like
a
brush
therefore
i
thought
it
just
as
well
before
any
london
philandering
took
place
that
i
should
have
a
little
time
to
look
round
me
and
to
see
what
girls
were
in
and
about
the
place
so
nobody
stayed
with
me
in
my
new
lodging
at
first
after
trottle
had
established
me
there
safe
and
sound
but
peggy
flobbins
my
maid
a
most
affectionate
and
attached
woman
who
never
was
an
object
of
philandering
since
i
have
known
her
and
is
not
likely
to
begin
to
become
so
after
years
next
march
it
was
the
fifth
of
november
when
i
first
breakfasted
in
my
new
rooms
the
guys
were
going
about
in
the
brown
fog
like
magnified
monsters
of
insects
in
and
there
was
a
guy
resting
on
the
of
the
house
to
let
i
put
on
my
glasses
partly
to
see
how
the
boys
were
pleased
with
what
i
sent
them
out
by
peggy
and
partly
to
make
sure
that
she
did
approach
too
near
the
ridiculous
object
which
of
course
was
full
of
and
might
go
off
into
bangs
at
any
moment
in
this
way
it
happened
that
the
first
time
i
ever
looked
at
the
house
to
let
after
i
became
its
opposite
neighbour
i
had
my
glasses
on
and
this
might
not
have
happened
once
in
fifty
times
for
my
sight
is
uncommonly
good
for
my
time
of
life
and
i
wear
glasses
as
little
as
i
can
for
fear
of
spoiling
it
i
knew
already
that
it
was
a
house
very
dirty
and
much
dilapidated
that
the
were
rusty
and
peeling
away
and
that
two
or
three
of
them
were
wanting
or
that
there
were
broken
panes
of
glass
in
the
windows
and
blotches
of
mud
on
other
panes
which
the
boys
had
thrown
at
them
that
there
was
quite
a
collection
of
stones
in
the
area
also
proceeding
from
those
young
mischiefs
that
there
were
games
chalked
on
the
pavement
before
the
house
and
likenesses
of
ghosts
chalked
on
the
that
the
windows
were
all
darkened
by
rotting
old
blinds
or
shutters
or
both
that
the
bills
to
let
had
curled
up
as
if
the
damp
air
of
the
place
had
given
them
cramps
or
had
dropped
down
into
corners
as
if
they
were
no
more
i
had
seen
all
this
on
my
first
visit
and
i
had
remarked
to
trottle
that
the
lower
part
of
the
black
board
about
terms
was
split
away
that
the
rest
had
become
illegible
and
that
the
very
stone
of
the
was
broken
across
notwithstanding
i
sat
at
my
breakfast
table
on
that
please
to
remember
the
fifth
of
november
morning
staring
at
the
house
through
my
glasses
as
if
i
had
never
looked
at
it
before
all
at
once
in
the
window
on
my
right
down
in
a
low
corner
at
a
hole
in
a
blind
or
a
shutter
i
found
that
i
was
looking
at
a
secret
eye
the
reflection
of
my
fire
may
have
touched
it
and
made
it
shine
but
i
saw
it
shine
and
vanish
the
eye
might
have
seen
me
or
it
might
not
have
seen
me
sitting
there
in
the
glow
of
my
fire
you
can
take
which
probability
you
prefer
without
offence
but
something
struck
through
my
frame
as
if
the
sparkle
of
this
eye
had
been
electric
and
had
flashed
straight
at
me
it
had
such
an
effect
upon
me
that
i
could
not
remain
by
myself
and
i
rang
for
flobbins
and
invented
some
little
jobs
for
her
to
keep
her
in
the
room
after
my
breakfast
was
cleared
away
i
sat
in
the
same
place
with
my
glasses
on
moving
my
head
now
so
and
now
so
trying
whether
with
the
shining
of
my
fire
and
the
flaws
in
the
i
could
reproduce
any
sparkle
seeming
to
be
up
there
that
was
like
the
sparkle
of
an
eye
but
no
i
could
make
nothing
like
it
i
could
make
ripples
and
crooked
lines
in
the
front
of
the
house
to
let
and
i
could
even
twist
one
window
up
and
loop
it
into
another
but
i
could
make
no
eye
nor
anything
like
an
eye
so
i
convinced
myself
that
i
really
had
seen
an
eye
well
to
be
sure
i
could
not
get
rid
of
the
impression
of
this
eye
and
it
troubled
me
and
troubled
me
until
it
was
almost
a
torment
i
think
i
was
previously
inclined
to
concern
my
head
much
about
the
opposite
house
but
after
this
eye
my
head
was
full
of
the
house
and
i
thought
of
little
else
than
the
house
and
i
watched
the
house
and
i
talked
about
the
house
and
i
dreamed
of
the
house
in
all
this
i
fully
believe
now
there
was
a
good
providence
but
you
will
judge
for
yourself
about
that
my
landlord
was
a
butler
who
had
married
a
cook
and
set
up
housekeeping
they
had
not
kept
house
longer
than
a
couple
of
years
and
they
knew
no
more
about
the
house
to
let
than
i
did
neither
could
i
find
out
anything
concerning
it
among
the
or
otherwise
further
than
what
trottle
had
told
me
at
first
it
had
been
empty
some
said
six
years
some
said
eight
some
said
ten
it
never
did
let
they
all
agreed
and
it
never
would
let
i
soon
felt
convinced
that
i
should
work
myself
into
one
of
my
states
about
the
house
and
i
soon
did
i
lived
for
a
whole
month
in
a
flurry
that
was
always
getting
worse
towers
prescriptions
which
i
had
brought
to
london
with
me
were
of
no
more
use
than
nothing
in
the
cold
winter
sunlight
in
the
thick
winter
fog
in
the
black
winter
rain
in
the
white
winter
snow
the
house
was
equally
on
my
mind
i
have
heard
as
everybody
else
has
of
a
spirit
haunting
a
house
but
i
have
had
my
own
personal
experience
of
a
house
haunting
a
spirit
for
that
house
haunted
mine
in
all
that
month
time
i
never
saw
anyone
go
into
the
house
nor
come
out
of
the
house
i
supposed
that
such
a
thing
must
take
place
sometimes
in
the
dead
of
the
night
or
the
glimmer
of
the
morning
but
i
never
saw
it
done
i
got
no
relief
from
having
my
curtains
drawn
when
it
came
on
dark
and
shutting
out
the
house
the
eye
then
began
to
shine
in
my
fire
i
am
a
single
old
woman
i
should
say
at
once
without
being
at
all
afraid
of
the
name
i
am
an
old
maid
only
that
i
am
older
than
the
phrase
would
express
the
time
was
when
i
had
my
but
it
is
long
and
long
ago
he
was
killed
at
sea
dear
heaven
rest
his
blessed
head
when
i
was
i
have
all
my
life
since
ever
i
can
remember
been
deeply
fond
of
children
i
have
always
felt
such
a
love
for
them
that
i
have
had
my
sorrowful
and
sinful
times
when
i
have
fancied
something
must
have
gone
wrong
in
my
life
something
must
have
been
turned
aside
from
its
original
intention
i
mean
or
i
should
have
been
the
proud
and
happy
mother
of
many
children
and
a
fond
old
grandmother
this
day
i
have
soon
known
better
in
the
cheerfulness
and
contentment
that
god
has
blessed
me
with
and
given
me
abundant
reason
for
and
yet
i
have
had
to
dry
my
eyes
even
then
when
i
have
thought
of
my
dear
brave
hopeful
handsome
charley
and
the
trust
meant
to
cheer
me
with
charley
was
my
youngest
brother
and
he
went
to
india
he
married
there
and
sent
his
gentle
little
wife
home
to
me
to
be
confined
and
she
was
to
go
back
to
him
and
the
baby
was
to
be
left
with
me
and
i
was
to
bring
it
up
it
never
belonged
to
this
life
it
took
its
silent
place
among
the
other
incidents
in
my
story
that
might
have
been
but
never
were
i
had
hardly
time
to
whisper
to
her
dead
my
own
or
she
to
answer
ashes
to
ashes
dust
to
dust
o
lay
it
on
my
breast
and
comfort
charley
when
she
had
gone
to
seek
her
baby
at
our
saviour
feet
i
went
to
charley
and
i
told
him
there
was
nothing
left
but
me
poor
me
and
i
lived
with
charley
out
there
several
years
he
was
a
man
of
fifty
when
he
fell
asleep
in
my
arms
his
face
had
changed
to
be
almost
old
and
a
little
stern
but
it
softened
and
softened
when
i
laid
it
down
that
i
might
cry
and
pray
beside
it
and
when
i
looked
at
it
for
the
last
time
it
was
my
dear
untroubled
handsome
youthful
charley
of
long
ago
i
was
going
on
to
tell
that
the
loneliness
of
the
house
to
let
brought
back
all
these
recollections
and
that
they
had
quite
pierced
my
heart
one
evening
when
flobbins
opening
the
door
and
looking
very
much
as
if
she
wanted
to
laugh
but
thought
better
of
it
said
jabez
jarber
upon
which
jarber
ambled
in
in
his
usual
absurd
way
saying
sophonisba
which
i
am
obliged
to
confess
is
my
name
a
pretty
one
and
proper
one
enough
when
it
was
given
to
me
but
a
good
many
years
out
of
date
now
and
always
sounding
particularly
and
comical
from
his
lips
so
i
said
sharply
though
it
is
sophonisba
jarber
you
are
not
obliged
to
mention
it
that
see
in
reply
to
this
observation
the
ridiculous
man
put
the
tips
of
my
five
fingers
to
his
lips
and
said
again
with
an
aggravating
accent
on
the
third
syllable
i
do
burn
lamps
because
i
ca
abide
the
smell
of
oil
and
wax
candles
belonged
to
my
day
i
hope
the
convenient
situation
of
one
of
my
tall
old
candlesticks
on
the
table
at
my
elbow
will
be
my
excuse
for
saying
that
if
he
did
that
again
i
would
chop
his
toes
with
it
i
am
sorry
to
add
that
when
i
told
him
so
i
knew
his
toes
to
be
tender
but
really
at
my
time
of
life
and
at
jarber
it
is
too
much
of
a
good
thing
there
is
an
orchestra
still
standing
in
the
open
air
at
the
wells
before
which
in
the
presence
of
a
throng
of
fine
company
i
have
walked
a
minuet
with
jarber
but
there
is
a
house
still
standing
in
which
i
have
worn
a
pinafore
and
had
a
tooth
drawn
by
fastening
a
thread
to
the
tooth
and
the
and
toddling
away
from
the
door
and
how
should
i
look
now
at
my
years
in
a
pinafore
or
having
a
door
for
my
dentist
besides
jarber
always
was
more
or
less
an
absurd
man
he
was
sweetly
dressed
and
beautifully
perfumed
and
many
girls
of
my
day
would
have
given
their
ears
for
him
though
i
am
bound
to
add
that
he
never
cared
a
fig
for
them
or
their
advances
either
and
that
he
was
very
constant
to
me
for
he
not
only
proposed
to
me
before
my
ended
in
sorrow
but
afterwards
too
not
once
nor
yet
twice
nor
will
we
say
how
many
times
however
many
they
were
or
however
few
they
were
the
last
time
he
paid
me
that
compliment
was
immediately
after
he
had
presented
me
with
a
digestive
stuck
on
the
point
of
a
pin
and
i
said
on
that
occasion
laughing
heartily
now
jarber
if
you
do
know
that
two
people
whose
united
ages
would
make
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
have
got
to
be
old
i
do
and
i
beg
to
swallow
this
nonsense
in
the
form
of
this
pill
which
i
took
on
the
spot
and
i
request
to
hear
no
more
of
it
after
that
he
conducted
himself
pretty
well
he
was
always
a
little
squeezed
man
was
jarber
in
little
sprigged
waistcoats
and
he
had
always
little
legs
and
a
little
smile
and
a
little
voice
and
little
ways
as
long
as
i
can
remember
him
he
was
always
going
little
errands
for
people
and
carrying
little
gossip
at
this
present
time
when
he
called
me
sophonisba
he
had
a
little
lodging
in
that
new
neighbourhood
of
mine
i
had
not
seen
him
for
two
or
three
years
but
i
had
heard
that
he
still
went
out
with
a
little
and
stood
on
in
saint
james
street
to
see
the
nobility
go
to
court
and
went
in
his
little
cloak
and
goloshes
outside
willis
rooms
to
see
them
go
to
almack
and
caught
the
frightfullest
colds
and
got
himself
trodden
upon
by
coachmen
and
linkmen
until
he
went
home
to
his
landlady
a
mass
of
bruises
and
had
to
be
nursed
for
a
month
jarber
took
off
his
little
cloak
and
sat
down
opposite
me
with
his
little
cane
and
hat
in
his
hand
let
us
have
no
more
sophonisbaing
if
please
jarber
i
said
call
me
sarah
how
do
you
do
i
hope
you
are
pretty
well
thank
you
and
you
said
jarber
i
am
as
well
as
an
old
woman
can
expect
to
be
jarber
was
beginning
say
not
old
sophon
but
i
looked
at
the
candlestick
and
he
left
off
pretending
not
to
have
said
anything
i
am
infirm
of
course
i
said
and
so
are
you
let
us
both
be
thankful
it
no
worse
is
it
possible
that
you
look
worried
said
jarber
it
is
very
possible
i
have
no
doubt
it
is
the
fact
and
what
has
worried
my
friend
said
jarber
something
not
easy
i
suppose
to
comprehend
i
am
worried
to
death
by
a
house
to
let
over
the
way
jarber
went
with
his
little
step
to
the
peeped
out
and
looked
round
at
me
yes
said
i
in
answer
that
house
after
peeping
out
again
jarber
came
back
to
his
chair
with
a
tender
air
and
asked
how
does
it
worry
you
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
said
i
of
course
every
house
a
mystery
more
or
less
but
something
that
i
do
care
to
mention
for
truly
the
eye
was
so
slight
a
thing
to
mention
that
i
was
more
than
half
ashamed
of
it
has
made
that
house
so
mysterious
to
me
and
has
so
fixed
it
in
my
mind
that
i
have
had
no
peace
for
a
month
i
foresee
that
i
shall
have
no
peace
either
until
trottle
comes
to
me
next
monday
i
might
have
mentioned
before
that
there
is
a
jealousy
between
trottle
and
jarber
and
that
there
is
never
any
love
lost
between
those
two
petulantly
repeated
jarber
with
a
little
flourish
of
his
cane
how
is
to
restore
the
lost
peace
of
sarah
he
will
exert
himself
to
find
out
something
about
the
house
i
have
fallen
into
that
state
about
it
that
i
really
must
discover
by
some
means
or
other
good
or
bad
fair
or
foul
how
and
why
it
is
that
that
house
remains
to
let
and
why
trottle
why
not
putting
his
little
hat
to
his
heart
why
not
jarber
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
never
thought
of
jarber
in
the
matter
and
now
i
do
think
of
jarber
through
your
having
the
kindness
to
suggest
him
for
which
i
am
really
and
truly
obliged
to
you
i
do
think
he
could
do
it
sarah
i
think
it
would
be
too
much
for
you
jarber
sarah
there
would
be
coming
and
going
and
fetching
and
carrying
jarber
and
you
might
catch
cold
sarah
what
can
be
done
by
trottle
can
be
done
by
me
i
am
on
terms
of
acquaintance
with
every
person
of
responsibility
in
this
parish
i
am
intimate
at
the
circulating
library
i
converse
daily
with
the
assessed
taxes
i
lodge
with
the
water
rate
i
know
the
medical
man
i
lounge
habitually
at
the
house
agent
i
dine
with
the
churchwardens
i
move
to
the
guardians
trottle
a
person
in
the
sphere
of
a
domestic
and
totally
unknown
to
society
do
be
warm
jarber
in
mentioning
trottle
i
have
naturally
relied
on
my
who
would
take
any
trouble
to
gratify
even
a
whim
of
his
old
mistress
but
if
you
can
find
out
anything
to
help
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
this
house
to
let
i
shall
be
fully
as
much
obliged
to
you
as
if
there
was
never
a
trottle
in
the
land
jarber
rose
and
put
on
his
little
cloak
a
couple
of
fierce
brass
lions
held
it
tight
round
his
little
throat
but
a
couple
of
the
mildest
hares
might
have
done
that
i
am
sure
sarah
he
said
i
go
expect
me
on
monday
evening
the
sixth
when
perhaps
you
will
give
me
a
cup
of
tea
may
i
ask
for
no
green
adieu
this
was
on
a
thursday
the
second
of
december
when
i
reflected
that
trottle
would
come
back
on
monday
too
i
had
my
misgivings
as
to
the
difficulty
of
keeping
the
two
powers
from
open
warfare
and
indeed
i
was
more
uneasy
than
i
quite
like
to
confess
however
the
empty
house
swallowed
up
that
thought
next
morning
as
it
swallowed
up
most
other
thoughts
now
and
the
house
quite
preyed
upon
me
all
that
day
and
all
the
saturday
it
was
a
very
wet
sunday
raining
and
blowing
from
morning
to
night
when
the
bells
rang
for
afternoon
church
they
seemed
to
ring
in
the
commotion
of
the
puddles
as
well
as
in
the
wind
and
they
sounded
very
loud
and
dismal
indeed
and
the
street
looked
very
dismal
indeed
and
the
house
looked
dismallest
of
all
i
was
reading
my
prayers
near
the
light
and
my
fire
was
growing
in
the
darkening
when
looking
up
as
i
prayed
for
the
fatherless
children
and
widows
and
all
who
were
desolate
and
oppressed
i
saw
the
eye
again
it
passed
in
a
moment
as
it
had
done
before
but
this
time
i
was
inwardly
more
convinced
that
i
had
seen
it
well
to
be
sure
i
a
night
that
night
whenever
i
closed
my
own
eyes
it
was
to
see
eyes
next
morning
at
an
unreasonably
and
i
should
have
said
but
for
that
railroad
an
impossibly
early
hour
comes
trottle
as
soon
as
he
had
told
me
all
about
the
wells
i
told
him
all
about
the
house
he
listened
with
as
great
interest
and
attention
as
i
could
possibly
wish
until
i
came
to
jabez
jarber
when
he
cooled
in
an
instant
and
became
opinionated
now
trottle
i
said
pretending
not
to
notice
when
jarber
comes
back
this
evening
we
must
all
lay
our
heads
together
i
should
hardly
think
that
would
be
wanted
jarber
head
is
surely
equal
to
anything
being
determined
not
to
notice
i
said
again
that
we
must
all
lay
our
heads
together
whatever
you
order
shall
be
obeyed
still
it
can
not
be
doubted
i
should
think
that
jarber
head
is
equal
if
not
superior
to
any
pressure
that
can
be
brought
to
bear
upon
it
this
was
provoking
and
his
way
when
he
came
in
and
out
all
through
the
day
of
pretending
not
to
see
the
house
to
let
was
more
provoking
still
however
being
quite
resolved
not
to
notice
i
gave
no
sign
whatever
that
i
did
notice
but
when
evening
came
and
he
showed
in
jarber
and
when
jarber
would
be
helped
off
with
his
cloak
and
poked
his
cane
into
cane
and
china
ornaments
and
his
own
eye
in
trying
to
unclasp
his
brazen
lions
of
himself
which
he
could
do
after
all
i
could
have
shaken
them
both
as
it
was
i
only
shook
the
and
made
the
tea
jarber
had
brought
from
under
his
cloak
a
roll
of
paper
with
which
he
had
triumphantly
pointed
over
the
way
like
the
ghost
of
hamlet
father
appearing
to
the
late
kemble
and
which
he
had
laid
on
the
table
a
discovery
said
i
pointing
to
it
when
he
was
seated
and
had
got
his
do
go
trottle
the
first
of
a
series
of
discoveries
answered
jarber
account
of
a
former
tenant
compiled
from
the
water
rate
and
medical
man
do
go
trottle
i
repeated
for
i
saw
him
making
imperceptibly
to
the
door
begging
your
pardon
i
might
be
in
jarber
way
jarber
looked
that
he
decidedly
thought
he
might
be
i
relieved
myself
with
a
good
angry
croak
and
said
always
determined
not
to
notice
have
the
goodness
to
sit
down
if
you
please
trottle
i
wish
you
to
hear
this
trottle
bowed
in
the
stiffest
manner
and
took
the
remotest
chair
he
could
find
even
that
he
moved
close
to
the
draught
from
the
keyhole
of
the
door
firstly
jarber
began
after
sipping
his
tea
would
my
sophon
begin
again
jarber
said
i
would
you
be
much
surprised
if
this
house
to
let
should
turn
out
to
be
the
property
of
a
relation
of
your
own
i
should
indeed
be
very
much
surprised
then
it
belongs
to
your
first
cousin
i
learn
by
the
way
that
he
is
ill
at
this
time
george
forley
then
that
is
a
bad
beginning
i
can
not
deny
that
george
forley
stands
in
the
relation
of
first
cousin
to
me
but
i
hold
no
communication
with
him
george
forley
has
been
a
hard
bitter
stony
father
to
a
child
now
dead
george
forley
was
most
implacable
and
unrelenting
to
one
of
his
two
daughters
who
made
a
poor
marriage
george
forley
brought
all
the
weight
of
his
band
to
bear
as
heavily
against
that
crushed
thing
as
he
brought
it
to
bear
lightly
favouringly
and
advantageously
upon
her
sister
who
made
a
rich
marriage
i
hope
that
with
the
measure
george
forley
meted
it
may
not
be
measured
out
to
him
again
i
will
give
george
forley
no
worse
wish
i
was
strong
upon
the
subject
and
i
could
not
keep
the
tears
out
of
my
eyes
for
that
young
girl
was
a
cruel
story
and
i
had
dropped
many
a
tear
over
it
before
the
house
being
george
forley
said
i
is
almost
enough
to
account
for
there
being
a
fate
upon
it
if
fate
there
is
is
there
anything
about
george
forley
in
those
sheets
of
paper
not
a
word
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
please
to
read
on
trottle
why
do
you
come
nearer
why
do
you
sit
mortifying
yourself
in
those
arctic
regions
come
nearer
thank
you
i
am
quite
near
enough
to
mr
jarber
jarber
rounded
his
chair
to
get
his
back
full
to
my
opinionated
friend
and
servant
and
beginning
to
read
tossed
the
words
at
him
over
his
jabez
jarber
own
ear
and
shoulder
he
read
what
follows
the
manchester
marriage
and
openshaw
came
from
manchester
to
london
and
took
the
house
to
let
he
had
been
what
is
called
in
lancashire
a
salesman
for
a
large
manufacturing
firm
who
were
extending
their
business
and
opening
a
warehouse
in
london
where
openshaw
was
now
to
superintend
the
business
he
rather
enjoyed
the
change
of
residence
having
a
kind
of
curiosity
about
london
which
he
had
never
yet
been
able
to
gratify
in
his
brief
visits
to
the
metropolis
at
the
same
time
he
had
an
odd
shrewd
contempt
for
the
inhabitants
whom
he
had
always
pictured
to
himself
as
fine
lazy
people
caring
nothing
but
for
fashion
and
aristocracy
and
lounging
away
their
days
in
bond
street
and
such
places
ruining
good
english
and
ready
in
their
turn
to
despise
him
as
a
provincial
the
hours
that
the
men
of
business
kept
in
the
city
scandalised
him
too
accustomed
as
he
was
to
the
early
dinners
of
manchester
folk
and
the
consequently
far
longer
evenings
still
he
was
pleased
to
go
to
london
though
he
would
not
for
the
world
have
confessed
it
even
to
himself
and
always
spoke
of
the
step
to
his
friends
as
one
demanded
of
him
by
the
interests
of
his
employers
and
sweetened
to
him
by
a
considerable
increase
of
salary
his
salary
indeed
was
so
liberal
that
he
might
have
been
justified
in
taking
a
much
larger
house
than
this
one
had
he
not
thought
himself
bound
to
set
an
example
to
londoners
of
how
little
a
manchester
man
of
business
cared
for
show
inside
however
he
furnished
the
house
with
an
unusual
degree
of
comfort
and
in
the
winter
time
he
insisted
on
keeping
up
as
large
fires
as
the
grates
would
allow
in
every
room
where
the
temperature
was
in
the
least
chilly
moreover
his
northern
sense
of
hospitality
was
such
that
if
he
were
at
home
he
could
hardly
suffer
a
visitor
to
leave
the
house
without
forcing
meat
and
drink
upon
him
every
servant
in
the
house
was
well
warmed
well
fed
and
kindly
treated
for
their
master
scorned
all
petty
saving
in
aught
that
conduced
to
comfort
while
he
amused
himself
by
following
out
all
his
accustomed
habits
and
individual
ways
in
defiance
of
what
any
of
his
new
neighbours
might
think
his
wife
was
a
pretty
gentle
woman
of
suitable
age
and
character
he
was
she
he
was
loud
and
decided
she
soft
and
yielding
they
had
two
children
or
rather
i
should
say
she
had
two
for
the
elder
a
girl
of
eleven
was
openshaw
child
by
frank
wilson
her
first
husband
the
younger
was
a
little
boy
edwin
who
could
just
prattle
and
to
whom
his
father
delighted
to
speak
in
the
broadest
and
most
unintelligible
lancashire
dialect
in
order
to
keep
up
what
he
called
the
true
saxon
accent
openshaw
was
alice
and
her
first
husband
had
been
her
own
cousin
she
was
the
orphan
niece
of
a
in
liverpool
a
quiet
grave
little
creature
of
great
personal
attraction
when
she
was
fifteen
or
sixteen
with
regular
features
and
a
blooming
complexion
but
she
was
very
shy
and
believed
herself
to
be
very
stupid
and
awkward
and
was
frequently
scolded
by
her
aunt
her
own
uncle
second
wife
so
when
her
cousin
frank
wilson
came
home
from
a
long
absence
at
sea
and
first
was
kind
and
protective
to
her
secondly
attentive
and
thirdly
desperately
in
love
with
her
she
hardly
knew
how
to
be
grateful
enough
to
him
it
is
true
she
would
have
preferred
his
remaining
in
the
first
or
second
stages
of
behaviour
for
his
violent
love
puzzled
and
frightened
her
her
uncle
neither
helped
nor
hindered
the
love
affair
though
it
was
going
on
under
his
own
eyes
frank
had
such
a
variable
temper
that
there
was
no
knowing
whether
what
she
liked
one
day
she
would
like
the
next
or
not
at
length
she
went
to
such
extremes
of
crossness
that
alice
was
only
too
glad
to
shut
her
eyes
and
rush
blindly
at
the
chance
of
escape
from
domestic
tyranny
offered
her
by
a
marriage
with
her
cousin
and
liking
him
better
than
any
one
in
the
world
except
her
uncle
who
was
at
this
time
at
sea
she
went
off
one
morning
and
was
married
to
him
her
only
bridesmaid
being
the
housemaid
at
her
aunt
the
consequence
was
that
frank
and
his
wife
went
into
lodgings
and
wilson
refused
to
see
them
and
turned
away
norah
the
housemaid
whom
they
accordingly
took
into
their
service
when
captain
wilson
returned
from
his
voyage
he
was
very
cordial
with
the
young
couple
and
spent
many
an
evening
at
their
lodgings
smoking
his
pipe
and
sipping
his
grog
but
he
told
them
that
for
sake
he
could
not
ask
them
to
his
own
house
for
his
wife
was
bitter
against
them
they
were
not
very
unhappy
about
this
the
seed
of
future
unhappiness
lay
rather
in
frank
vehement
passionate
disposition
which
led
him
to
resent
his
wife
shyness
and
want
of
demonstration
as
failures
in
conjugal
duty
he
was
already
tormenting
himself
and
her
too
in
a
slighter
degree
by
apprehensions
and
imaginations
of
what
might
befall
her
during
his
approaching
absence
at
sea
at
last
he
went
to
his
father
and
urged
him
to
insist
upon
being
once
more
received
under
his
roof
the
more
especially
as
there
was
now
a
prospect
of
her
confinement
while
her
husband
was
away
on
his
voyage
captain
wilson
was
as
he
himself
expressed
it
breaking
up
and
unwilling
to
undergo
the
excitement
of
a
scene
yet
he
felt
that
what
his
son
said
was
true
so
he
went
to
his
wife
and
before
frank
went
to
sea
he
had
the
comfort
of
seeing
his
wife
installed
in
her
old
little
garret
in
his
father
house
to
have
placed
her
in
the
one
best
spare
room
was
a
step
beyond
wilson
powers
of
submission
or
generosity
the
worst
part
about
it
however
was
that
the
faithful
norah
had
to
be
dismissed
her
place
as
housemaid
had
been
filled
up
and
even
had
it
not
she
had
forfeited
wilson
good
opinion
for
ever
she
comforted
her
young
master
and
mistress
by
pleasant
prophecies
of
the
time
when
they
would
have
a
household
of
their
own
of
which
in
whatever
service
she
might
be
in
the
meantime
she
should
be
sure
to
form
part
almost
the
last
action
frank
wilson
did
before
setting
sail
was
going
with
alice
to
see
norah
once
more
at
her
mother
house
and
then
he
went
away
alice
grew
more
and
more
feeble
as
winter
advanced
she
was
of
great
use
to
her
in
nursing
and
amusing
him
and
although
there
was
anxiety
enough
in
the
household
there
was
perhaps
more
of
peace
than
there
had
been
for
years
for
wilson
had
not
a
bad
heart
and
was
softened
by
the
visible
approach
of
death
to
one
whom
she
loved
and
touched
by
the
lonely
condition
of
the
young
creature
expecting
her
first
confinement
in
her
husband
absence
to
this
relenting
mood
norah
owed
the
permission
to
come
and
nurse
alice
when
her
baby
was
born
and
to
remain
to
attend
on
captain
wilson
before
one
letter
had
been
received
from
frank
who
had
sailed
for
the
east
indies
and
china
his
father
died
alice
was
always
glad
to
remember
that
he
had
held
her
baby
in
his
arms
and
kissed
and
blessed
it
before
his
death
after
that
and
the
consequent
examination
into
the
state
of
his
affairs
it
was
found
that
he
had
left
far
less
property
than
people
had
been
led
by
his
style
of
living
to
imagine
and
what
money
there
was
was
all
settled
upon
his
wife
and
at
her
disposal
after
her
death
this
did
not
signify
much
to
alice
as
frank
was
now
first
mate
of
his
ship
and
in
another
voyage
or
two
would
be
captain
meanwhile
he
had
left
her
some
hundreds
all
his
savings
in
the
bank
it
became
time
for
alice
to
hear
from
her
husband
one
letter
from
the
cape
she
had
already
received
the
next
was
to
announce
his
arrival
in
india
as
week
after
week
passed
over
and
no
intelligence
of
the
arrival
reached
the
office
of
the
owners
and
the
captain
wife
was
in
the
same
state
of
ignorant
suspense
as
alice
herself
her
fears
grew
most
oppressive
at
length
the
day
came
when
in
reply
to
her
inquiry
at
the
shipping
office
they
told
her
that
the
owners
had
given
up
hope
of
ever
hearing
more
of
the
and
had
sent
in
their
claim
upon
the
underwriters
now
that
he
was
gone
for
ever
she
first
felt
a
yearning
longing
love
for
the
kind
cousin
the
dear
friend
the
sympathising
protector
whom
she
should
never
see
again
first
felt
a
passionate
desire
to
show
him
his
child
whom
she
had
hitherto
rather
craved
to
have
all
to
herself
her
own
sole
possession
her
grief
was
however
noiseless
and
quiet
rather
to
the
scandal
of
wilson
who
bewailed
her
as
if
he
and
she
had
always
lived
together
in
perfect
harmony
and
who
evidently
thought
it
her
duty
to
burst
into
fresh
tears
at
every
strange
face
she
saw
dwelling
on
his
poor
young
desolate
state
and
the
helplessness
of
the
fatherless
child
with
an
unction
as
if
she
liked
the
excitement
of
the
sorrowful
story
so
passed
away
the
first
days
of
alice
widowhood
things
subsided
into
their
natural
and
tranquil
course
but
as
if
this
young
creature
was
always
to
be
in
some
heavy
trouble
her
began
to
be
ailing
pining
and
sickly
the
child
mysterious
illness
turned
out
to
be
some
affection
of
the
spine
likely
to
affect
health
but
not
to
shorten
life
at
least
so
the
doctors
said
but
the
long
dreary
suffering
of
one
whom
a
mother
loves
as
alice
loved
her
only
child
is
hard
to
look
forward
to
only
norah
guessed
what
alice
suffered
no
one
but
god
knew
and
so
it
fell
out
that
when
wilson
the
elder
came
to
her
one
day
in
violent
distress
occasioned
by
a
very
material
diminution
in
the
value
the
property
that
her
husband
had
left
her
a
diminution
which
made
her
income
barely
enough
to
support
herself
much
less
alice
the
latter
could
hardly
understand
how
anything
which
did
not
touch
health
or
life
could
cause
such
grief
and
she
received
the
intelligence
with
irritating
composure
but
when
that
afternoon
the
little
sick
child
was
brought
in
and
the
grandmother
who
after
all
loved
it
well
began
a
fresh
moan
over
her
losses
to
its
unconscious
ears
saying
how
she
had
planned
to
consult
this
or
that
doctor
and
to
give
it
this
or
that
comfort
or
luxury
in
after
yearn
but
that
now
all
chance
of
this
had
passed
away
alice
heart
was
touched
and
she
drew
near
to
wilson
with
unwonted
caresses
and
in
a
spirit
not
unlike
to
that
of
ruth
entreated
that
come
what
would
they
might
remain
together
after
much
discussion
in
succeeding
days
it
was
arranged
that
wilson
should
take
a
house
in
manchester
furnishing
it
partly
with
what
furniture
she
had
and
providing
the
rest
with
alice
remaining
two
hundred
pounds
wilson
was
herself
a
manchester
woman
and
naturally
longed
to
return
to
her
native
town
some
connections
of
her
own
at
that
time
required
lodgings
for
which
they
were
willing
to
pay
pretty
handsomely
alice
undertook
the
active
superintendence
and
superior
work
of
the
household
norah
willing
faithful
norah
offered
to
cook
scour
do
anything
in
short
so
that
she
might
but
remain
with
them
the
plan
succeeded
for
some
years
their
first
lodgers
remained
with
them
and
all
went
smoothly
with
the
one
sad
exception
of
the
little
girl
increasing
deformity
how
that
mother
loved
that
child
is
not
for
words
to
tell
then
came
a
break
of
misfortune
their
lodgers
left
and
no
one
succeeded
to
them
after
some
months
they
had
to
remove
to
a
smaller
house
and
alice
tender
conscience
was
torn
by
the
idea
that
she
ought
not
to
be
a
burden
to
her
but
ought
to
go
out
and
seek
her
own
maintenance
and
leave
her
child
the
thought
came
like
the
sweeping
boom
of
a
funeral
bell
over
her
heart
openshaw
came
to
lodge
with
them
he
had
started
in
life
as
the
and
of
a
warehouse
had
struggled
up
through
all
the
grades
of
employment
in
the
place
fighting
his
way
through
the
hard
striving
manchester
life
with
strong
pushing
energy
of
character
every
spare
moment
of
time
had
been
sternly
given
up
to
teaching
he
was
a
capital
accountant
a
good
french
and
german
scholar
a
keen
tradesman
understanding
markets
and
the
bearing
of
events
both
near
and
distant
on
trade
and
yet
with
such
vivid
attention
to
present
details
that
i
do
not
think
he
ever
saw
a
group
of
flowers
in
the
fields
without
thinking
whether
their
colours
would
or
would
not
form
harmonious
contrasts
in
the
coming
spring
muslins
and
prints
he
went
to
debating
societies
and
threw
himself
with
all
his
heart
and
soul
into
politics
esteeming
it
must
be
owned
every
man
a
fool
or
a
knave
who
differed
from
him
and
overthrowing
his
opponents
rather
by
the
loud
strength
of
his
language
than
the
calm
strength
if
his
logic
there
was
something
of
the
yankee
in
all
this
indeed
his
theory
ran
parallel
to
the
famous
yankee
motto
england
flogs
creation
and
manchester
flogs
england
such
a
man
as
may
be
fancied
had
had
no
time
for
falling
in
love
or
any
such
nonsense
at
the
age
when
most
young
men
go
through
their
courting
and
matrimony
he
had
not
the
means
of
keeping
a
wife
and
was
far
too
practical
to
think
of
having
one
and
now
that
he
was
in
easy
circumstances
a
rising
man
he
considered
women
almost
as
incumbrances
to
the
world
with
whom
a
man
had
better
have
as
little
to
do
as
possible
his
first
impression
of
alice
was
indistinct
and
he
did
not
care
enough
about
her
to
make
it
distinct
a
pretty
nay
kind
of
woman
would
have
been
his
description
of
her
if
he
had
been
pushed
into
a
corner
he
was
rather
afraid
in
the
beginning
that
her
quiet
ways
arose
from
a
listlessness
and
laziness
of
character
which
would
have
been
exceedingly
discordant
to
his
active
energetic
nature
but
when
he
found
out
the
punctuality
with
which
his
wishes
were
attended
to
and
her
work
was
done
when
he
was
called
in
the
morning
at
the
very
stroke
of
the
clock
his
scalding
hot
his
fire
bright
his
coffee
made
exactly
as
his
peculiar
fancy
dictated
for
he
was
a
man
who
had
his
theory
about
everything
based
upon
what
he
knew
of
science
and
often
perfectly
original
then
he
began
to
think
not
that
alice
had
any
peculiar
merit
but
that
he
had
got
into
remarkably
good
lodgings
his
restlessness
wore
away
and
he
began
to
consider
himself
as
almost
settled
for
life
in
them
openshaw
had
been
too
busy
all
his
life
to
be
introspective
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
any
tenderness
in
his
nature
and
if
he
had
become
conscious
of
its
abstract
existence
he
would
have
considered
it
as
a
manifestation
of
disease
in
some
part
of
his
nature
but
he
was
decoyed
into
pity
unawares
and
pity
led
on
to
tenderness
that
little
helpless
child
always
carried
about
by
one
of
the
three
busy
women
of
the
house
or
else
patiently
threading
coloured
beads
in
the
chair
from
which
by
no
effort
of
its
own
could
it
ever
move
the
great
grave
blue
eyes
full
of
serious
not
uncheerful
expression
giving
to
the
small
delicate
face
a
look
beyond
its
years
the
soft
plaintive
voice
dropping
out
but
few
words
so
unlike
the
continual
prattle
of
a
child
caught
openshaw
attention
in
spite
of
himself
one
day
he
half
scorned
himself
for
doing
so
he
cut
short
his
to
go
in
search
of
some
toy
which
should
take
the
place
of
those
eternal
beads
i
forget
what
he
bought
but
when
he
gave
the
present
which
he
took
care
to
do
in
a
short
abrupt
manner
and
when
no
one
was
by
to
see
him
he
was
almost
thrilled
by
the
flash
of
delight
that
came
over
that
child
face
and
could
not
help
all
through
that
afternoon
going
over
and
over
again
the
picture
left
on
his
memory
by
the
bright
effect
of
unexpected
joy
on
the
little
girl
face
when
he
returned
home
he
found
his
slippers
placed
by
his
fire
and
even
more
careful
attention
paid
to
his
fancies
than
was
habitual
in
those
model
lodgings
when
alice
had
taken
the
last
of
his
away
she
had
been
silent
as
usual
till
then
she
stood
for
an
instant
with
the
door
in
her
hand
openshaw
looked
as
if
he
were
deep
in
his
book
though
in
fact
he
did
not
see
a
line
but
was
heartily
wishing
the
woman
would
be
gone
and
not
make
any
palaver
of
gratitude
but
she
only
said
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
sir
thank
you
very
much
and
was
gone
even
before
he
could
send
her
away
with
a
there
my
good
woman
enough
for
some
time
longer
he
took
no
apparent
notice
of
the
child
he
even
hardened
his
heart
into
disregarding
her
sudden
flush
of
colour
and
little
timid
smile
of
recognition
when
he
saw
her
by
chance
but
after
all
this
could
not
last
for
ever
and
having
a
second
time
given
way
to
tenderness
there
was
no
relapse
the
insidious
enemy
having
thus
entered
his
heart
in
the
guise
of
compassion
to
the
child
soon
assumed
the
more
dangerous
form
of
interest
in
the
mother
he
was
aware
of
this
change
of
feeling
despised
himself
for
it
struggled
with
it
nay
internally
yielded
to
it
and
cherished
it
long
before
he
suffered
the
slightest
expression
of
it
by
word
action
or
look
to
escape
him
he
watched
alice
docile
obedient
ways
to
her
stepmother
the
love
which
she
had
inspired
in
the
rough
norah
roughened
by
the
wear
and
tear
of
sorrow
and
years
but
above
all
he
saw
the
wild
deep
passionate
affection
existing
between
her
and
her
child
they
spoke
little
to
any
one
else
or
when
any
one
else
was
by
but
when
alone
together
they
talked
and
murmured
and
cooed
and
chattered
so
continually
that
openshaw
first
wondered
what
they
could
find
to
say
to
each
other
and
next
became
irritated
because
they
were
always
so
grave
and
silent
with
him
all
this
time
he
was
perpetually
devising
small
new
pleasures
for
the
child
his
thoughts
ran
in
a
pertinacious
way
upon
the
desolate
life
before
her
and
often
he
came
back
from
his
day
work
loaded
with
the
very
thing
alice
had
been
longing
for
but
had
not
been
able
to
procure
one
time
it
was
a
little
chair
for
drawing
the
little
sufferer
along
the
streets
and
many
an
evening
that
ensuing
summer
openshaw
drew
her
along
himself
regardless
of
the
remarks
of
his
acquaintances
one
day
in
autumn
he
put
down
his
newspaper
as
alice
came
in
with
the
breakfast
and
said
in
as
indifferent
a
voice
as
he
could
assume
frank
is
there
any
reason
why
we
two
should
not
put
up
our
horses
together
alice
stood
still
in
perplexed
wonder
what
did
he
mean
he
had
resumed
the
reading
of
his
newspaper
as
if
he
did
not
expect
any
answer
so
she
found
silence
her
safest
course
and
went
on
quietly
arranging
his
breakfast
without
another
word
passing
between
them
just
as
he
was
leaving
the
house
to
go
to
the
warehouse
as
usual
he
turned
back
and
put
his
head
into
the
bright
neat
tidy
kitchen
where
all
the
women
breakfasted
in
the
morning
you
think
of
what
i
said
frank
this
was
her
name
with
the
lodgers
and
let
me
have
your
opinion
upon
it
alice
was
thankful
that
her
mother
and
norah
were
too
busy
talking
together
to
attend
much
to
this
speech
she
determined
not
to
think
about
it
at
all
through
the
day
and
of
course
the
effort
not
to
think
made
her
think
all
the
more
at
night
she
sent
up
norah
with
his
tea
but
openshaw
almost
knocked
norah
down
as
she
was
going
out
at
the
door
by
pushing
past
her
and
calling
out
mrs
frank
in
an
impatient
voice
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
alice
went
up
rather
than
seem
to
have
affixed
too
much
meaning
to
his
words
well
frank
he
said
what
answer
do
make
it
too
long
for
i
have
lots
of
to
get
through
i
hardly
know
what
you
meant
sir
said
truthful
alice
well
i
should
have
thought
you
might
have
guessed
you
not
new
at
this
sort
of
work
and
i
am
however
i
make
it
plain
this
time
will
you
have
me
to
be
thy
wedded
husband
and
serve
me
and
love
me
and
honour
me
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
because
if
you
will
i
will
do
as
much
by
you
and
be
a
father
to
your
child
and
that
more
than
is
put
in
the
now
i
a
man
of
my
word
and
what
i
say
i
feel
and
what
i
promise
i
do
now
for
your
answer
alice
was
silent
he
began
to
make
the
tea
as
if
her
reply
was
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
him
but
as
soon
as
that
was
done
he
became
impatient
well
said
he
how
long
sir
may
i
have
to
think
over
it
three
minutes
looking
at
his
watch
you
had
two
already
that
makes
five
be
a
sensible
woman
say
yes
and
sit
down
to
tea
with
me
and
we
talk
it
over
together
for
after
tea
i
shall
be
busy
say
no
he
hesitated
a
moment
to
try
and
keep
his
voice
in
the
same
tone
and
i
sha
say
another
word
about
it
but
pay
up
a
year
rent
for
my
rooms
and
be
off
time
up
yes
or
no
if
you
please
sir
you
have
been
so
good
to
little
ailsie
there
sit
down
comfortably
by
me
on
the
sofa
and
let
us
have
our
tea
together
i
am
glad
to
find
you
are
as
good
and
sensible
as
i
took
for
and
this
was
alice
wilson
second
wooing
openshaw
will
was
too
strong
and
his
circumstances
too
good
for
him
not
to
carry
all
before
him
he
settled
wilson
in
a
comfortable
house
of
her
own
and
made
her
quite
independent
of
lodgers
the
little
that
alice
said
with
regard
to
future
plans
was
in
norah
behalf
no
said
openshaw
norah
shall
take
care
of
the
old
lady
as
long
as
she
lives
and
after
that
she
shall
either
come
and
live
with
us
or
if
she
likes
it
better
she
shall
have
a
provision
for
life
for
your
sake
missus
no
one
who
has
been
good
to
you
or
the
child
shall
go
unrewarded
but
even
the
little
one
will
be
better
for
some
fresh
stuff
about
her
get
her
a
bright
sensible
girl
as
a
nurse
one
who
wo
go
rubbing
her
with
jelly
as
norah
does
wasting
good
stuff
outside
that
ought
to
go
in
but
will
follow
doctors
directions
which
as
you
must
see
pretty
clearly
by
this
time
norah
wo
because
they
give
the
poor
little
wench
pain
now
i
not
above
being
nesh
for
other
folks
myself
i
can
stand
a
good
blow
and
never
change
colour
but
set
me
in
the
in
the
infirmary
and
i
turn
as
sick
as
a
girl
yet
if
need
were
i
would
hold
the
little
wench
on
my
knees
while
she
screeched
with
pain
if
it
were
to
do
her
poor
back
good
nay
nay
wench
keep
your
white
looks
for
the
time
when
it
comes
i
do
say
it
ever
will
but
this
i
know
norah
will
spare
the
child
and
cheat
the
doctor
if
she
can
now
i
say
give
the
bairn
a
year
or
two
chance
and
then
when
the
pack
of
doctors
have
done
their
best
and
maybe
the
old
lady
has
gone
we
have
norah
back
or
do
better
for
her
the
pack
of
doctors
could
do
no
good
to
little
ailsie
she
was
beyond
their
power
but
her
father
for
so
he
insisted
on
being
called
and
also
on
alice
no
longer
retaining
the
appellation
of
mama
but
becoming
henceforward
mother
by
his
healthy
cheerfulness
of
manner
his
clear
decision
of
purpose
his
odd
turns
and
quirks
of
humour
added
to
his
real
strong
love
for
the
helpless
little
girl
infused
a
new
element
of
brightness
and
confidence
into
her
life
and
though
her
back
remained
the
same
her
general
health
was
strengthened
and
alice
never
going
beyond
a
smile
herself
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
child
taught
to
laugh
as
for
alice
own
life
it
was
happier
than
it
had
ever
been
openshaw
required
no
demonstration
no
expressions
of
affection
from
her
indeed
these
would
rather
have
disgusted
him
alice
could
love
deeply
but
could
not
talk
about
it
the
perpetual
requirement
of
loving
words
looks
and
caresses
and
misconstruing
their
absence
into
absence
of
love
had
been
the
great
trial
of
her
former
married
life
now
all
went
on
clear
and
straight
under
the
guidance
of
her
husband
strong
sense
warm
heart
and
powerful
will
year
by
year
their
worldly
prosperity
increased
at
wilson
death
norah
came
back
to
them
as
nurse
to
the
little
edwin
into
which
post
she
was
not
installed
without
a
pretty
strong
oration
on
the
part
of
the
proud
and
happy
father
who
declared
that
if
he
found
out
that
norah
ever
tried
to
screen
the
boy
by
a
falsehood
or
to
make
him
nesh
either
in
body
or
mind
she
should
go
that
very
day
norah
and
openshaw
were
not
on
the
most
thoroughly
cordial
terms
neither
of
them
fully
recognising
or
appreciating
the
other
best
qualities
this
was
the
previous
history
of
the
lancashire
family
who
had
now
removed
to
london
and
had
come
to
occupy
the
house
they
had
been
there
about
a
year
when
openshaw
suddenly
informed
his
wife
that
he
had
determined
to
heal
feuds
and
had
asked
his
uncle
and
aunt
chadwick
to
come
and
pay
them
a
visit
and
see
london
openshaw
had
never
seen
this
uncle
and
aunt
of
her
husband
years
before
she
had
married
him
there
had
been
a
quarrel
all
she
knew
was
that
chadwick
was
a
small
manufacturer
in
a
country
town
in
south
lancashire
she
was
extremely
pleased
that
the
breach
was
to
be
healed
and
began
making
preparations
to
render
their
visit
pleasant
they
arrived
at
last
going
to
see
london
was
such
an
event
to
them
that
chadwick
had
made
all
new
linen
fresh
for
the
downwards
and
as
for
gowns
ribbons
and
collars
she
might
have
been
going
into
the
wilds
of
canada
where
never
a
shop
is
so
large
was
her
stock
a
fortnight
before
the
day
of
her
departure
for
london
she
had
formally
called
to
take
leave
of
all
her
acquaintance
saying
she
should
need
all
the
intermediate
time
for
packing
up
it
was
like
a
second
wedding
in
her
imagination
and
to
complete
the
resemblance
which
an
entirely
new
wardrobe
made
between
the
two
events
her
husband
brought
her
back
from
manchester
on
the
last
before
they
set
off
a
gorgeous
pearl
and
amethyst
brooch
saying
lunnon
should
see
that
lancashire
folks
knew
a
handsome
thing
when
they
saw
it
for
some
time
after
and
chadwick
arrived
at
the
openshaws
there
was
no
opportunity
for
wearing
this
brooch
but
at
length
they
obtained
an
order
to
see
buckingham
palace
and
the
spirit
of
loyalty
demanded
that
chadwick
should
wear
her
best
clothes
in
visiting
the
abode
of
her
sovereign
on
her
return
she
hastily
changed
her
dress
for
openshaw
had
planned
that
they
should
go
to
richmond
drink
tea
and
return
by
moonlight
accordingly
about
five
and
openshaw
and
and
chadwick
set
off
the
housemaid
and
cook
sate
below
norah
hardly
knew
where
she
was
always
engrossed
in
the
nursery
in
tending
her
two
children
and
in
sitting
by
the
restless
excitable
ailsie
till
she
fell
asleep
bye
the
housemaid
bessy
tapped
gently
at
the
door
norah
went
to
her
and
they
spoke
in
whispers
nurse
there
some
one
wants
you
wants
me
who
is
it
a
gentleman
a
gentleman
nonsense
well
a
man
then
and
he
asks
for
you
and
he
rung
at
the
front
door
bell
and
has
walked
into
the
you
should
never
have
let
him
exclaimed
norah
master
and
missus
out
i
did
not
want
him
to
come
in
but
when
he
heard
you
lived
here
he
walked
past
me
and
sat
down
on
the
first
chair
and
said
her
to
come
and
speak
to
me
there
is
no
gas
lighted
in
the
room
and
supper
is
all
set
out
he
be
off
with
the
spoons
exclaimed
norah
putting
the
fear
into
words
and
preparing
to
leave
the
room
first
however
giving
a
look
to
ailsie
sleeping
soundly
and
calmly
she
went
uneasy
fears
stirring
in
her
bosom
before
she
entered
the
she
provided
herself
with
a
candle
and
with
it
in
her
hand
she
went
in
looking
round
her
in
the
darkness
for
her
visitor
he
was
standing
up
holding
by
the
table
norah
and
he
looked
at
each
other
gradual
recognition
coming
into
their
eyes
norah
at
length
he
asked
who
are
you
asked
norah
with
the
sharp
tones
of
alarm
and
incredulity
i
do
know
you
trying
by
futile
words
of
disbelief
to
do
away
with
the
terrible
fact
before
her
am
i
so
changed
he
said
pathetically
i
daresay
i
am
but
norah
tell
me
he
breathed
hard
where
is
my
wife
is
she
is
she
alive
he
came
nearer
to
norah
and
would
have
taken
her
hand
but
she
backed
away
from
him
looking
at
him
all
the
time
with
staring
eyes
as
if
he
were
some
horrible
object
yet
he
was
a
handsome
bronzed
fellow
with
beard
and
moustache
giving
him
a
aspect
but
his
eyes
there
was
no
mistaking
those
eager
beautiful
eyes
the
very
same
that
norah
had
watched
not
ago
till
sleep
stole
softly
over
them
tell
me
norah
i
can
bear
it
i
have
feared
it
so
often
is
she
dead
norah
still
kept
silence
she
is
dead
he
hung
on
norah
words
and
looks
as
if
for
confirmation
or
contradiction
what
shall
i
do
groaned
norah
o
sir
why
did
you
come
how
did
you
find
me
out
where
have
you
been
we
thought
you
dead
we
did
indeed
she
poured
out
words
and
questions
to
gain
time
as
if
time
would
help
her
norah
answer
me
this
question
straight
by
yes
or
no
is
my
wife
dead
no
she
is
not
said
norah
slowly
and
heavily
o
what
a
relief
did
she
receive
my
letters
but
perhaps
you
know
why
did
you
leave
her
where
is
she
o
norah
tell
me
all
quickly
mr
frank
said
norah
at
last
almost
driven
to
bay
by
her
terror
lest
her
mistress
should
return
at
any
moment
and
find
him
there
unable
to
consider
what
was
best
to
be
done
or
at
something
decisive
because
she
could
not
endure
her
present
state
frank
we
never
heard
a
line
from
you
and
the
shipowners
said
you
had
gone
down
you
and
every
one
else
we
thought
you
were
dead
if
ever
man
was
and
poor
miss
alice
and
her
little
sick
helpless
child
o
sir
you
must
guess
it
cried
the
poor
creature
at
last
bursting
out
into
a
passionate
fit
of
crying
for
indeed
i
can
not
tell
it
but
it
was
no
one
fault
god
help
us
all
this
night
norah
had
sate
down
she
trembled
too
much
to
stand
he
took
her
hands
in
his
he
squeezed
them
hard
as
if
by
physical
pressure
the
truth
could
be
wrung
out
norah
this
time
his
tone
was
calm
stagnant
as
despair
she
has
married
again
norah
shook
her
head
sadly
the
grasp
slowly
relaxed
the
man
had
fainted
there
was
brandy
in
the
room
norah
forced
some
drops
into
mouth
chafed
his
hands
and
when
mere
animal
life
returned
before
the
mind
poured
in
its
flood
of
memories
and
thoughts
she
lifted
him
up
and
rested
his
head
against
her
knees
then
she
put
a
few
crumbs
of
bread
taken
from
the
soaked
in
brandy
into
his
mouth
suddenly
he
sprang
to
his
feet
where
is
she
tell
me
this
instant
he
looked
so
wild
so
mad
so
desperate
that
norah
felt
herself
to
be
in
bodily
danger
but
her
time
of
dread
had
gone
by
she
had
been
afraid
to
tell
him
the
truth
and
then
she
had
been
a
coward
now
her
wits
were
sharpened
by
the
sense
of
his
desperate
state
he
must
leave
the
house
she
would
pity
him
afterwards
but
now
she
must
rather
command
and
upbraid
for
he
must
leave
the
house
before
her
mistress
came
home
that
one
necessity
stood
clear
before
her
she
is
not
here
that
is
enough
for
you
to
know
nor
can
i
say
exactly
where
she
is
which
was
true
to
the
letter
if
not
to
the
spirit
go
away
and
tell
me
where
to
find
you
and
i
will
tell
you
all
my
master
and
mistress
may
come
back
at
any
minute
and
then
what
would
become
of
me
with
a
strange
man
in
the
house
such
an
argument
was
too
petty
to
touch
his
excited
mind
i
do
care
for
your
master
and
mistress
if
your
master
is
a
man
he
must
feel
for
me
poor
shipwrecked
sailor
that
i
am
kept
for
years
a
prisoner
amongst
savages
always
always
always
thinking
of
my
wife
and
my
home
dreaming
of
her
by
night
talking
to
her
though
she
could
not
hear
by
day
i
loved
her
more
than
all
heaven
and
earth
put
together
tell
me
where
she
is
this
instant
you
wretched
woman
who
salved
over
her
wickedness
to
her
as
you
do
to
me
the
clock
struck
ten
desperate
positions
require
desperate
measures
if
you
will
leave
the
house
now
i
will
come
to
you
and
tell
you
all
what
is
more
you
shall
see
your
child
now
she
lies
sleeping
o
sir
you
have
a
child
you
do
not
know
that
as
yet
a
little
weakly
girl
with
just
a
heart
and
soul
beyond
her
years
we
have
reared
her
up
with
such
care
we
watched
her
for
we
thought
for
many
a
year
she
might
die
any
day
and
we
tended
her
and
no
hard
thing
has
come
near
her
and
no
rough
word
has
ever
been
said
to
her
and
now
you
come
and
will
take
her
life
into
your
hand
and
will
crush
it
strangers
to
her
have
been
kind
to
her
but
her
own
father
frank
i
am
her
nurse
and
i
love
her
and
i
tend
her
and
i
would
do
anything
for
her
that
i
could
her
mother
heart
beats
as
hers
beats
and
if
she
suffers
a
pain
her
mother
trembles
all
over
if
she
is
happy
it
is
her
mother
that
smiles
and
is
glad
if
she
is
growing
stronger
her
mother
is
healthy
if
she
dwindles
her
mother
languishes
if
she
dies
well
i
do
know
it
is
not
every
one
can
lie
down
and
die
when
they
wish
it
come
frank
and
see
your
child
seeing
her
will
do
good
to
your
poor
heart
then
go
away
in
god
name
just
this
one
morrow
if
need
be
you
can
do
anything
kill
us
all
if
you
will
or
show
yourself
a
great
grand
man
whom
god
will
bless
for
ever
and
ever
come
frank
the
look
of
a
sleeping
child
is
sure
to
give
peace
she
led
him
at
first
almost
helping
his
steps
till
they
came
near
the
nursery
door
she
had
almost
forgotten
the
existence
of
little
edwin
it
struck
upon
her
with
affright
as
the
shaded
light
fell
upon
the
other
cot
but
she
skilfully
threw
that
corner
of
the
room
into
darkness
and
let
the
light
fall
on
the
sleeping
ailsie
the
child
had
thrown
down
the
coverings
and
her
deformity
as
she
lay
with
her
back
to
them
was
plainly
visible
through
her
slight
her
little
face
deprived
of
the
lustre
of
her
eyes
looked
wan
and
pinched
and
had
a
pathetic
expression
in
it
even
as
she
slept
the
poor
father
looked
and
looked
with
hungry
wistful
eyes
into
which
the
big
tears
came
swelling
up
slowly
and
dropped
heavily
down
as
he
stood
trembling
and
shaking
all
over
norah
was
angry
with
herself
for
growing
impatient
of
the
length
of
time
that
long
lingering
gaze
lasted
she
thought
that
she
waited
for
full
before
frank
stirred
and
then
instead
of
going
away
he
sank
down
on
his
knees
by
the
bedside
and
buried
his
face
in
the
clothes
little
ailsie
stirred
uneasily
norah
pulled
him
up
in
terror
she
could
afford
no
more
time
even
for
prayer
in
her
extremity
of
fear
for
surely
the
next
moment
would
bring
her
mistress
home
she
took
him
forcibly
by
the
arm
but
as
he
was
going
his
eye
lighted
on
the
other
bed
he
stopped
intelligence
came
back
into
his
face
his
hands
clenched
his
child
he
asked
her
child
replied
norah
god
watches
over
him
said
she
instinctively
for
frank
looks
excited
her
fears
and
she
needed
to
remind
herself
of
the
protector
of
the
helpless
god
has
not
watched
over
me
he
said
in
despair
his
thoughts
apparently
recoiling
on
his
own
desolate
deserted
state
but
norah
had
no
time
for
pity
she
would
be
as
compassionate
as
her
heart
prompted
at
length
she
guided
him
downstairs
and
shut
the
outer
door
and
bolted
it
as
if
by
bolts
to
keep
out
facts
then
she
went
back
into
the
and
effaced
all
traces
of
his
presence
as
far
as
she
could
she
went
upstairs
to
the
nursery
and
sate
there
her
head
on
her
hand
thinking
what
was
to
come
of
all
this
misery
it
seemed
to
her
very
long
before
they
did
return
yet
it
was
hardly
eleven
she
so
heard
the
loud
hearty
lancashire
voices
on
the
stairs
and
for
the
first
time
she
understood
the
contrast
of
the
desolation
of
the
poor
man
who
had
so
lately
gone
forth
in
lonely
despair
it
almost
put
her
out
of
patience
to
see
openshaw
come
in
calmly
smiling
handsomely
dressed
happy
easy
to
inquire
after
her
children
did
ailsie
go
to
sleep
comfortably
she
whispered
to
norah
yes
her
mother
bent
over
her
looking
at
her
slumbers
with
the
soft
eyes
of
love
how
little
she
dreamed
who
had
looked
on
her
last
then
she
went
to
edwin
with
perhaps
less
wistful
anxiety
in
her
countenance
but
more
of
pride
she
took
off
her
things
to
go
down
to
supper
norah
saw
her
no
more
that
night
beside
the
door
into
the
passage
the
opened
out
of
and
openshaw
room
in
order
that
they
might
have
the
children
more
immediately
under
their
own
eyes
early
the
next
summer
morning
openshaw
was
awakened
by
ailsie
startled
call
of
mother
mother
she
sprang
up
put
on
her
and
went
to
her
child
ailsie
was
only
half
awake
and
in
a
not
uncommon
state
of
terror
who
was
he
mother
tell
me
who
my
darling
no
one
is
here
you
have
been
dreaming
love
waken
up
quite
see
it
is
broad
daylight
yes
said
ailsie
looking
round
her
then
clinging
to
her
mother
said
but
a
man
was
here
in
the
night
mother
nonsense
little
goose
no
man
has
ever
come
near
you
yes
he
did
he
stood
there
just
by
norah
a
man
with
hair
and
a
beard
and
he
knelt
down
and
said
his
prayers
norah
knows
he
was
here
mother
half
angrily
as
openshaw
shook
her
head
in
smiling
incredulity
well
we
will
ask
norah
when
she
comes
said
openshaw
soothingly
but
we
wo
talk
any
more
about
him
now
it
is
not
five
it
is
too
early
for
you
to
get
up
shall
i
fetch
you
a
book
and
read
to
you
do
leave
me
mother
said
the
child
clinging
to
her
so
openshaw
sate
on
the
bedside
talking
to
ailsie
and
telling
her
of
what
they
had
done
at
richmond
the
evening
before
until
the
little
eyes
slowly
closed
and
she
once
more
fell
asleep
what
was
the
matter
asked
openshaw
as
his
wife
returned
to
bed
ailsie
wakened
up
in
a
fright
with
some
story
of
a
man
having
been
in
the
room
to
say
his
prayers
a
dream
i
suppose
and
no
more
was
said
at
the
time
openshaw
had
almost
forgotten
the
whole
affair
when
she
got
up
about
seven
but
she
heard
a
sharp
altercation
going
on
in
the
nursery
norah
speaking
angrily
to
ailsie
a
most
unusual
thing
both
and
openshaw
listened
in
astonishment
hold
your
tongue
ailsie
let
me
hear
none
of
your
dreams
never
let
me
hear
you
tell
that
story
again
ailsie
began
to
cry
openshaw
opened
the
door
of
communication
before
his
wife
could
say
a
word
norah
come
here
the
nurse
stood
at
the
door
defiant
she
perceived
she
had
been
heard
but
she
was
desperate
do
let
me
hear
you
speak
in
that
manner
to
ailsie
again
he
said
sternly
and
shut
the
door
norah
was
infinitely
relieved
for
she
had
dreaded
some
questioning
and
a
little
blame
for
sharp
speaking
was
what
she
could
well
bear
if
examination
was
let
alone
they
went
openshaw
carrying
ailsie
the
sturdy
edwin
coming
step
by
step
right
foot
foremost
always
holding
his
hand
each
child
was
placed
in
a
chair
by
the
and
then
and
openshaw
stood
together
at
the
window
awaiting
their
visitors
appearance
and
making
plans
for
the
day
there
was
a
pause
suddenly
openshaw
turned
to
ailsie
and
said
what
a
little
goosy
somebody
is
with
her
dreams
waking
up
poor
tired
mother
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
a
story
of
a
man
being
in
the
room
father
i
sure
i
saw
him
said
ailsie
half
crying
i
do
want
to
make
norah
angry
but
i
was
not
asleep
for
all
she
says
i
was
i
had
been
asleep
and
i
awakened
up
quite
wide
awake
though
i
was
so
frightened
i
kept
my
eyes
nearly
shut
and
i
saw
the
man
quite
plain
a
great
brown
man
with
a
beard
he
said
his
prayers
and
then
he
looked
at
edwin
and
then
norah
took
him
by
the
arm
and
led
him
away
after
they
had
whispered
a
bit
together
now
my
little
woman
must
be
reasonable
said
openshaw
who
was
always
patient
with
ailsie
there
was
no
man
in
the
house
last
night
at
all
no
man
comes
into
the
house
as
you
know
if
you
think
much
less
goes
up
into
the
nursery
but
sometimes
we
dream
something
has
happened
and
the
dream
is
so
like
reality
that
you
are
not
the
first
person
little
woman
who
has
stood
out
that
the
thing
has
really
happened
but
indeed
it
was
not
a
dream
said
ailsie
beginning
to
cry
just
then
and
chadwick
came
down
looking
grave
and
discomposed
all
during
breakfast
time
they
were
silent
and
uncomfortable
as
soon
as
the
breakfast
things
were
taken
away
and
the
children
had
been
carried
chadwick
began
in
an
evidently
preconcerted
manner
to
inquire
if
his
nephew
was
certain
that
all
his
servants
were
honest
for
that
chadwick
had
that
morning
missed
a
very
valuable
brooch
which
she
had
worn
the
day
before
she
remembered
taking
it
off
when
she
came
home
from
buckingham
palace
openshaw
face
contracted
into
hard
lines
grew
like
what
it
was
before
he
had
known
his
wife
and
her
child
he
rang
the
bell
even
before
his
uncle
had
done
speaking
it
was
answered
by
the
housemaid
mary
was
any
one
here
last
night
while
we
were
away
a
man
sir
came
to
speak
to
norah
to
speak
to
norah
who
was
he
how
long
did
he
stay
i
sure
i
ca
tell
sir
he
came
perhaps
about
nine
i
went
up
to
tell
norah
in
the
nursery
and
she
came
down
to
speak
to
him
she
let
him
out
sir
she
will
know
who
he
was
and
how
long
he
stayed
she
waited
a
moment
to
be
asked
any
more
questions
but
she
was
not
so
she
went
away
a
minute
afterwards
openshaw
made
as
though
he
were
going
out
of
the
room
but
his
wife
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
do
not
speak
to
her
before
the
children
she
said
in
her
low
quiet
voice
i
will
go
up
and
question
her
no
i
must
speak
to
her
you
must
know
said
he
turning
to
his
uncle
and
aunt
my
missus
has
an
old
servant
as
faithful
as
ever
woman
was
i
do
believe
as
far
as
love
goes
but
at
the
same
time
who
does
not
always
speak
truth
as
even
the
missus
must
allow
now
my
notion
is
that
this
norah
of
ours
has
been
come
over
by
some
chap
for
she
at
the
time
o
life
when
they
say
women
pray
for
husbands
good
lord
any
and
has
let
him
into
our
house
and
the
chap
has
made
off
with
your
brooch
and
many
another
thing
beside
it
only
saying
that
norah
is
and
does
not
stick
at
a
white
lie
that
all
missus
it
was
curious
to
notice
how
his
tone
his
eyes
his
whole
face
changed
as
he
spoke
to
his
wife
but
he
was
the
resolute
man
through
all
she
knew
better
than
to
oppose
him
so
she
went
and
told
norah
her
master
wanted
to
speak
to
her
and
that
she
would
take
care
of
the
children
in
the
meanwhile
norah
rose
to
go
without
a
word
her
thoughts
were
these
if
they
tear
me
to
pieces
they
shall
never
know
through
me
he
may
come
and
then
just
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
all
for
some
of
us
are
dead
folk
to
a
certainty
but
he
shall
do
it
not
me
you
may
fancy
now
her
look
of
determination
as
she
faced
her
master
alone
in
the
and
chadwick
having
left
the
affair
in
their
nephew
hands
seeing
that
he
took
it
up
with
such
vehemence
norah
who
was
that
man
that
came
to
my
house
last
night
man
sir
as
if
infinitely
surprised
but
it
was
only
to
gain
time
yes
the
man
whom
mary
let
in
whom
she
went
to
the
nursery
to
tell
you
about
whom
you
came
down
to
speak
to
the
same
chap
i
make
no
doubt
whom
you
took
into
the
nursery
to
have
your
talk
out
with
whom
ailsie
saw
and
afterwards
dreamed
about
thinking
poor
wench
she
saw
him
say
his
prayers
when
nothing
i
be
bound
was
farther
from
his
thoughts
who
took
chadwick
brooch
value
ten
pounds
now
norah
do
go
off
i
am
as
sure
as
that
my
name
thomas
openshaw
that
you
knew
nothing
of
this
robbery
but
i
do
think
you
been
imposed
on
and
that
the
truth
some
chap
has
been
making
up
to
you
and
you
been
just
like
all
other
women
and
have
turned
a
soft
place
in
your
heart
to
him
and
he
came
last
night
and
you
had
him
up
in
the
nursery
and
he
made
use
of
his
opportunities
and
made
off
with
a
few
things
on
his
way
down
come
now
norah
it
no
blame
to
you
only
you
must
not
be
such
a
fool
again
tell
us
he
continued
what
name
he
gave
you
norah
i
be
bound
it
was
not
the
right
one
but
it
will
be
a
clue
for
the
police
norah
drew
herself
up
you
may
ask
that
question
and
taunt
me
with
my
being
single
and
with
my
credulity
as
you
will
master
openshaw
get
no
answer
from
me
as
for
the
brooch
and
the
story
of
theft
and
burglary
if
any
friend
ever
came
to
see
me
which
i
defy
you
to
prove
and
deny
he
be
just
as
much
above
doing
such
a
thing
as
you
yourself
openshaw
and
more
so
too
for
i
not
at
all
sure
as
everything
you
have
is
rightly
come
by
or
would
be
yours
long
if
every
man
had
his
own
she
meant
of
course
his
wife
but
he
understood
her
to
refer
to
his
property
in
goods
and
chattels
now
my
good
woman
said
he
i
just
tell
you
truly
i
never
trusted
you
out
and
out
but
my
wife
liked
you
and
i
thought
you
had
many
a
good
point
about
you
if
you
once
begin
to
sauce
me
i
have
the
police
to
you
and
get
out
the
truth
in
a
court
of
justice
if
you
not
tell
it
me
quietly
and
civilly
here
now
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
quietly
to
tell
me
who
the
fellow
is
look
here
a
man
comes
to
my
house
asks
for
you
you
take
him
a
valuable
brooch
is
missing
next
day
we
know
that
you
and
mary
and
cook
are
honest
but
you
refuse
to
tell
us
who
the
man
is
indeed
you
told
one
lie
already
about
him
saying
no
one
was
here
last
night
now
i
just
put
it
to
you
what
do
you
think
a
policeman
would
say
to
this
or
a
magistrate
a
magistrate
would
soon
make
you
tell
the
truth
my
good
woman
there
never
the
creature
born
that
should
get
it
out
of
me
said
norah
not
unless
i
choose
to
tell
i
a
great
mind
to
see
said
openshaw
growing
angry
at
the
defiance
then
checking
himself
he
thought
before
he
spoke
again
norah
for
your
missus
sake
i
do
want
to
go
to
extremities
be
a
sensible
woman
if
you
can
it
no
great
disgrace
after
all
to
have
been
taken
in
i
ask
you
once
more
as
a
friend
who
was
this
man
whom
you
let
into
my
house
last
night
no
answer
he
repeated
the
question
in
an
impatient
tone
still
no
answer
norah
lips
were
set
in
determination
not
to
speak
then
there
is
but
one
thing
to
be
done
i
shall
send
for
a
policeman
you
will
not
said
norah
starting
forwards
you
shall
not
sir
no
policeman
shall
touch
me
i
know
nothing
of
the
brooch
but
i
know
this
ever
since
i
was
i
have
thought
more
of
your
wife
than
of
myself
ever
since
i
saw
her
a
poor
motherless
girl
put
upon
in
her
uncle
house
i
have
thought
more
of
serving
her
than
of
serving
myself
i
have
cared
for
her
and
her
child
as
nobody
ever
cared
for
me
i
cast
blame
on
you
sir
but
i
say
it
ill
giving
up
one
life
to
any
one
for
at
the
end
they
will
turn
round
upon
you
and
forsake
you
why
does
not
my
missus
come
herself
to
suspect
me
maybe
she
is
gone
for
the
police
but
i
do
stay
here
either
for
police
or
magistrate
or
master
you
an
unlucky
lot
i
believe
there
a
curse
on
you
leave
you
this
very
day
yes
i
leave
that
poor
ailsie
too
i
will
no
good
will
ever
come
to
you
openshaw
was
utterly
astonished
at
this
speech
most
of
which
was
completely
unintelligible
to
him
as
may
easily
be
supposed
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
what
to
say
or
what
to
do
norah
had
left
the
room
i
do
not
think
he
had
ever
really
intended
to
send
for
the
police
to
this
old
servant
of
his
wife
for
he
had
never
for
a
moment
doubted
her
perfect
honesty
but
he
had
intended
to
compel
her
to
tell
him
who
the
man
was
and
in
this
he
was
baffled
he
was
consequently
much
irritated
he
returned
to
his
uncle
and
aunt
in
a
state
of
great
annoyance
and
perplexity
and
told
them
he
could
get
nothing
out
of
the
woman
that
some
man
had
been
in
the
house
the
night
before
but
that
she
refused
to
tell
who
he
was
at
this
moment
his
wife
came
in
greatly
agitated
and
asked
what
had
happened
to
norah
for
that
she
had
put
on
her
things
in
passionate
haste
and
had
left
the
house
this
looks
suspicious
said
chadwick
it
is
not
the
way
in
which
an
honest
person
would
have
acted
openshaw
kept
silence
he
was
sorely
perplexed
but
openshaw
turned
round
on
chadwick
with
a
sudden
fierceness
no
one
ever
saw
in
her
before
you
do
know
norah
uncle
she
is
gone
because
she
is
deeply
hurt
at
being
suspected
o
i
wish
i
had
seen
her
that
i
had
spoken
to
her
myself
she
would
have
told
me
anything
alice
wrung
her
hands
i
must
confess
continued
chadwick
to
his
nephew
in
a
lower
voice
i
ca
make
you
out
you
used
to
be
a
word
and
a
blow
and
oftenest
the
blow
first
and
now
when
there
is
every
cause
for
suspicion
you
just
do
nought
your
missus
is
a
very
good
woman
i
grant
but
she
may
have
been
put
upon
as
well
as
other
folk
i
suppose
if
you
do
send
for
the
police
i
shall
very
well
replied
openshaw
surlily
i
ca
clear
norah
she
wo
clear
herself
as
i
believe
she
might
if
she
would
only
i
wash
my
hands
of
it
for
i
am
sure
the
woman
herself
is
honest
and
she
lived
a
long
time
with
my
wife
and
i
do
like
her
to
come
to
shame
but
she
will
then
be
forced
to
clear
herself
that
at
any
rate
will
be
a
good
thing
very
well
very
well
i
am
of
the
whole
business
come
alice
come
up
to
the
babies
they
be
in
a
sore
way
i
tell
you
uncle
he
said
turning
round
once
more
to
chadwick
suddenly
and
sharply
after
his
eye
had
fallen
on
alice
wan
tearful
anxious
face
i
have
none
sending
for
the
police
after
all
i
buy
my
aunt
twice
as
handsome
a
brooch
this
very
day
but
i
not
have
norah
suspected
and
my
missus
plagued
there
for
you
he
and
his
wife
left
the
room
chadwick
quietly
waited
till
he
was
out
of
hearing
and
then
aid
to
his
wife
for
all
tom
heroics
just
quietly
going
for
a
detective
wench
thou
know
nought
about
it
he
went
to
the
and
made
a
statement
of
the
case
he
was
gratified
by
the
impression
which
the
evidence
against
norah
seemed
to
make
the
men
all
agreed
in
his
opinion
and
steps
were
to
be
immediately
taken
to
find
out
where
she
was
most
probably
as
they
suggested
she
had
gone
at
once
to
the
man
who
to
all
appearance
was
her
lover
when
chadwick
asked
how
they
would
find
her
out
they
smiled
shook
their
heads
and
spoke
of
mysterious
but
infallible
ways
and
means
he
returned
to
his
nephew
house
with
a
very
comfortable
opinion
of
his
own
sagacity
he
was
met
by
his
wife
with
a
penitent
face
o
master
i
found
my
brooch
it
was
just
sticking
by
its
pin
in
the
flounce
of
my
brown
silk
that
i
wore
yesterday
i
took
it
off
in
a
hurry
and
it
must
have
caught
in
it
and
i
hung
up
my
gown
in
the
closet
just
now
when
i
was
going
to
fold
it
up
there
was
the
brooch
i
very
vexed
but
i
never
dreamt
but
what
it
was
lost
her
husband
muttering
something
very
like
confound
thee
and
thy
brooch
too
i
wish
i
never
given
it
thee
snatched
up
his
hat
and
rushed
back
to
the
station
hoping
to
be
in
time
to
stop
the
police
from
searching
for
norah
but
a
detective
was
already
gone
off
on
the
errand
where
was
norah
half
mad
with
the
strain
of
the
fearful
secret
she
had
hardly
slept
through
the
night
for
thinking
what
must
be
done
upon
this
terrible
state
of
mind
had
come
ailsie
questions
showing
that
she
had
seen
the
man
as
the
unconscious
child
called
her
father
lastly
came
the
suspicion
of
her
honesty
she
was
little
less
than
crazy
as
she
ran
and
dashed
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
leaving
all
else
even
her
purse
behind
her
in
that
house
she
would
not
stay
that
was
all
she
knew
or
was
clear
about
she
would
not
even
see
the
children
again
for
fear
it
should
weaken
her
she
feared
above
everything
return
to
claim
his
wife
she
could
not
tell
what
remedy
there
was
for
a
sorrow
so
tremendous
for
her
to
stay
to
witness
the
desire
of
escaping
from
the
coming
event
was
a
stronger
motive
for
her
departure
than
her
soreness
about
the
suspicions
directed
against
her
although
this
last
had
been
the
final
goad
to
the
course
she
took
she
walked
away
almost
at
headlong
speed
sobbing
as
she
went
as
she
had
not
dared
to
do
during
the
past
night
for
fear
of
exciting
wonder
in
those
who
might
hear
her
then
she
stopped
an
idea
came
into
her
mind
that
she
would
leave
london
altogether
and
betake
herself
to
her
native
town
of
liverpool
she
felt
in
her
pocket
for
her
purse
as
she
drew
near
the
euston
square
station
with
this
intention
she
had
left
it
at
home
her
poor
head
aching
her
eyes
swollen
with
crying
she
had
to
stand
still
and
think
as
well
as
she
could
where
next
she
should
bend
her
steps
suddenly
the
thought
flashed
into
her
mind
that
she
would
go
and
find
out
poor
frank
she
had
been
hardly
kind
to
him
the
night
before
though
her
heart
had
bled
for
him
ever
since
she
remembered
his
telling
her
as
she
inquired
for
his
address
almost
as
she
had
pushed
him
out
of
the
door
of
some
hotel
in
a
street
not
far
distant
from
euston
square
thither
she
went
with
what
intention
she
hardly
knew
but
to
assuage
her
conscience
by
telling
him
how
much
she
pitied
him
in
her
present
state
she
felt
herself
unfit
to
counsel
or
restrain
or
assist
or
do
ought
else
but
sympathise
and
weep
the
people
of
the
inn
said
such
a
person
had
been
there
had
arrived
only
the
day
before
had
gone
out
soon
after
his
arrival
leaving
his
luggage
in
their
care
but
had
never
come
back
norah
asked
for
leave
to
sit
down
and
await
the
gentleman
return
the
landlady
pretty
secure
in
the
deposit
of
luggage
against
any
probable
injury
showed
her
into
a
room
and
quietly
locked
the
door
on
the
outside
norah
was
utterly
worn
out
and
fell
asleep
a
shivering
starting
uneasy
slumber
which
lasted
for
hours
the
detective
meanwhile
had
come
up
with
her
some
time
before
she
entered
the
hotel
into
which
he
followed
her
asking
the
landlady
to
detain
her
for
an
hour
or
so
without
giving
any
reason
beyond
showing
his
authority
which
made
the
landlady
applaud
herself
a
good
deal
for
having
locked
her
in
he
went
back
to
the
to
report
his
proceedings
he
could
have
taken
her
directly
but
his
object
was
if
possible
to
trace
out
the
man
who
was
supposed
to
have
committed
the
robbery
then
he
heard
of
the
discovery
of
the
brooch
and
consequently
did
not
care
to
return
norah
slept
till
even
the
summer
evening
began
to
close
in
then
up
some
one
was
at
the
door
it
would
be
frank
and
she
dizzily
pushed
back
her
ruffled
grey
hair
which
had
fallen
over
her
eyes
and
stood
looking
to
see
him
instead
there
came
in
openshaw
and
a
policeman
this
is
norah
kennedy
said
openshaw
o
sir
said
norah
i
did
not
touch
the
brooch
indeed
i
did
not
o
sir
i
can
not
live
to
be
thought
so
badly
of
and
very
sick
and
faint
she
suddenly
sank
down
on
the
ground
to
her
surprise
openshaw
raised
her
up
very
tenderly
even
the
policeman
helped
to
lay
her
on
the
sofa
and
at
openshaw
desire
he
went
for
some
wine
and
sandwiches
for
the
poor
gaunt
woman
lay
there
almost
as
if
dead
with
weariness
and
exhaustion
norah
said
openshaw
in
his
kindest
voice
the
brooch
is
found
it
was
hanging
to
chadwick
gown
i
beg
your
pardon
most
truly
i
beg
your
pardon
for
having
troubled
you
about
it
my
wife
is
almost
eat
norah
or
stay
first
drink
this
glass
of
wine
said
he
lifting
her
head
pouring
a
little
down
her
throat
as
she
drank
she
remembered
where
she
was
and
who
she
was
waiting
for
she
suddenly
pushed
openshaw
away
saying
o
sir
you
must
go
you
must
not
stop
a
minute
if
he
comes
back
he
will
kill
you
alas
norah
i
do
not
know
who
is
but
some
one
is
gone
away
who
will
never
come
back
someone
who
knew
you
and
whom
i
am
afraid
you
cared
for
i
do
understand
you
sir
said
norah
her
master
kind
and
sorrowful
manner
bewildering
her
yet
more
than
his
words
the
policeman
had
left
the
room
at
openshaw
desire
and
they
two
were
alone
you
know
what
i
mean
when
i
say
some
one
is
gone
who
will
never
come
back
i
mean
that
he
is
dead
who
said
norah
trembling
all
over
a
poor
man
has
been
found
in
the
thames
this
morning
drowned
did
he
drown
himself
asked
norah
solemnly
god
only
knows
replied
openshaw
in
the
same
tone
your
name
and
address
at
our
house
were
found
in
his
pocket
that
and
his
purse
were
the
only
things
that
were
found
upon
him
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
my
poor
norah
but
you
are
required
to
go
and
identify
him
to
what
asked
norah
to
say
who
it
is
it
is
always
done
in
order
that
some
reason
may
be
discovered
for
the
suicide
if
suicide
it
was
i
make
no
doubt
he
was
the
man
who
came
to
see
you
at
our
house
last
night
it
is
very
sad
i
know
he
made
pauses
between
each
little
clause
in
order
to
try
and
bring
back
her
senses
which
he
feared
were
wandering
so
wild
and
sad
was
her
look
master
openshaw
said
she
at
last
i
a
dreadful
secret
to
tell
you
only
you
must
never
breathe
it
to
any
one
and
you
and
i
must
hide
it
away
for
ever
i
thought
to
have
done
it
all
by
myself
but
i
see
i
can
not
yon
poor
man
yes
the
dead
drowned
creature
is
i
fear
frank
my
mistress
first
husband
openshaw
sate
down
as
if
shot
he
did
not
speak
but
after
a
while
he
signed
to
norah
to
go
on
he
came
to
me
the
other
night
when
god
be
thanked
you
were
all
away
at
richmond
he
asked
me
if
his
wife
was
dead
or
alive
i
was
a
brute
and
thought
more
of
our
all
coming
home
than
of
his
sore
trial
spoke
out
sharp
and
said
she
was
married
again
and
very
content
and
happy
i
all
but
turned
him
away
and
now
he
lies
dead
and
cold
god
forgive
me
said
openshaw
god
forgive
us
all
said
norah
yon
poor
man
needs
forgiveness
perhaps
less
than
any
one
among
us
he
had
been
among
the
savages
shipwrecked
i
know
not
what
and
he
had
written
letters
which
had
never
reached
my
poor
missus
he
saw
his
child
he
saw
her
yes
i
took
him
up
to
give
his
thoughts
another
start
for
i
believed
he
was
going
mad
on
my
hands
i
came
to
seek
him
here
as
i
more
than
half
promised
my
mind
misgave
me
when
i
heard
he
had
never
come
in
o
sir
i
it
must
be
him
openshaw
rang
the
bell
norah
was
almost
too
much
stunned
to
wonder
at
what
he
did
he
asked
for
writing
materials
wrote
a
letter
and
then
said
to
norah
i
am
writing
to
alice
to
say
i
shall
be
unavoidably
absent
for
a
few
days
that
i
have
found
you
that
you
are
well
and
send
her
your
love
and
will
come
home
you
must
go
with
me
to
the
police
court
you
must
identify
the
body
i
will
pay
high
to
keep
name
and
details
out
of
the
papers
but
where
are
you
going
sir
he
did
not
answer
her
directly
then
he
said
norah
i
must
go
with
you
and
look
on
the
face
of
the
man
whom
i
have
so
injured
unwittingly
it
is
true
but
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
had
killed
him
i
will
lay
his
head
in
the
grave
as
if
he
were
my
only
brother
and
how
he
must
have
hated
me
i
can
not
go
home
to
my
wife
till
all
that
i
can
do
for
him
is
done
then
i
go
with
a
dreadful
secret
on
my
mind
i
shall
never
speak
of
it
again
after
these
days
are
over
i
know
you
will
not
either
he
shook
hands
with
her
and
they
never
named
the
subject
again
the
one
to
the
other
norah
went
home
to
alice
the
next
day
not
a
word
was
said
on
the
cause
of
her
abrupt
departure
a
day
or
two
before
alice
had
been
charged
by
her
husband
in
his
letter
not
to
allude
to
the
supposed
theft
of
the
brooch
so
she
implicitly
obedient
to
those
whom
she
loved
both
by
nature
and
habit
was
entirely
silent
on
the
subject
only
treated
norah
with
the
most
tender
respect
as
if
to
make
up
for
unjust
suspicion
nor
did
alice
inquire
into
the
reason
why
openshaw
had
been
absent
during
his
uncle
and
aunt
visit
after
he
had
once
said
that
it
was
unavoidable
he
came
back
grave
and
quiet
and
from
that
time
forth
was
curiously
changed
more
thoughtful
and
perhaps
less
active
quite
as
decided
in
conduct
but
with
new
and
different
rules
for
the
guidance
of
that
conduct
towards
alice
he
could
hardly
be
more
kind
than
he
had
always
been
but
he
now
seemed
to
look
upon
her
as
some
one
sacred
and
to
be
treated
with
reverence
as
well
as
tenderness
he
throve
in
business
and
made
a
large
fortune
one
half
of
which
was
settled
upon
her
long
years
after
these
events
a
few
months
after
her
mother
died
ailsie
and
her
father
as
she
always
called
openshaw
drove
to
a
cemetery
a
little
way
out
of
town
and
she
was
carried
to
a
certain
mound
by
her
maid
who
was
then
sent
back
to
the
carriage
there
was
a
stone
with
and
a
date
that
was
all
sitting
by
the
grave
openshaw
told
her
the
story
and
for
the
sad
fate
of
that
poor
father
whom
she
had
never
seen
he
shed
the
only
tears
she
ever
saw
fall
from
his
eyes
a
most
interesting
story
all
through
i
said
as
jarber
folded
up
the
first
of
his
series
of
discoveries
in
triumph
a
story
that
goes
straight
to
the
heart
especially
at
the
end
but
i
stopped
and
looked
at
trottle
trottle
entered
his
protest
directly
in
the
shape
of
a
cough
well
i
said
beginning
to
lose
my
patience
do
you
see
that
i
want
you
to
speak
and
that
i
do
want
you
to
cough
quite
so
said
trottle
in
a
state
of
respectful
obstinacy
which
would
have
upset
the
temper
of
a
saint
relative
i
presume
to
this
story
yes
yes
said
jarber
by
all
means
let
us
hear
what
this
good
man
has
to
say
well
sir
answered
trottle
i
want
to
know
why
the
house
over
the
way
does
let
and
i
do
exactly
see
how
your
story
answers
the
question
that
all
i
have
to
say
sir
i
should
have
liked
to
contradict
my
opinionated
servant
at
that
moment
but
excellent
as
the
story
was
in
itself
i
felt
that
he
had
hit
on
the
weak
point
so
far
as
jarber
particular
purpose
in
reading
it
was
concerned
and
that
is
what
you
have
to
say
is
it
repeated
jarber
i
enter
this
room
announcing
that
i
have
a
series
of
discoveries
and
you
jump
instantly
to
the
conclusion
that
the
first
of
the
series
exhausts
my
resources
have
i
your
permission
dear
lady
to
enlighten
this
obtuse
person
if
possible
by
reading
number
two
my
work
is
behindhand
said
trottle
moving
to
the
door
the
moment
i
gave
jarber
leave
to
go
on
stop
where
you
are
i
said
in
my
most
peremptory
manner
and
give
jarber
his
fair
opportunity
of
answering
your
objection
now
you
have
made
it
trottle
sat
down
with
the
look
of
a
martyr
and
jarber
began
to
read
with
his
back
turned
on
the
enemy
more
decidedly
than
ever
going
into
society
at
one
period
of
its
reverses
the
house
fell
into
the
occupation
of
a
showman
he
was
found
registered
as
its
occupier
on
the
parish
books
of
the
time
when
he
rented
the
house
and
there
was
therefore
no
need
of
any
clue
to
his
name
but
he
himself
was
less
easy
to
be
found
for
he
had
led
a
wandering
life
and
settled
people
had
lost
sight
of
him
and
people
who
plumed
themselves
on
being
respectable
were
shy
of
admitting
that
they
had
ever
known
anything
of
him
at
last
among
the
marsh
lands
near
the
river
level
that
lie
about
deptford
and
the
neighbouring
a
grizzled
personage
in
velveteen
with
a
face
so
cut
up
by
varieties
of
weather
that
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
tattooed
was
found
smoking
a
pipe
at
the
door
of
a
wooden
house
on
wheels
the
wooden
house
was
laid
up
in
ordinary
for
the
winter
near
the
mouth
of
a
muddy
creek
and
everything
near
it
the
foggy
river
the
misty
marshes
and
the
steaming
smoked
in
company
with
the
grizzled
man
in
the
midst
of
this
smoking
party
the
of
the
wooden
house
on
wheels
was
not
remiss
but
took
its
pipe
with
the
rest
in
a
companionable
manner
on
being
asked
if
it
were
he
who
had
once
rented
the
house
to
let
grizzled
velveteen
looked
surprised
and
said
yes
then
his
name
was
magsman
that
was
it
toby
magsman
which
lawfully
christened
robert
but
called
in
the
line
from
a
infant
toby
there
was
nothing
agin
toby
magsman
he
believed
if
there
was
suspicion
of
such
mention
it
there
was
no
suspicion
of
such
he
might
rest
assured
but
some
inquiries
were
making
about
that
house
and
would
he
object
to
say
why
he
left
it
not
at
all
why
should
he
he
left
it
along
of
a
dwarf
along
of
a
dwarf
magsman
repeated
deliberately
and
emphatically
along
of
a
dwarf
might
it
be
compatible
with
magsman
inclination
and
convenience
to
enter
as
a
favour
into
a
few
particulars
magsman
entered
into
the
following
particulars
it
was
a
long
time
ago
to
begin
with
afore
lotteries
and
a
deal
more
was
done
away
with
magsman
was
looking
about
for
a
good
pitch
and
he
see
that
house
and
he
says
to
himself
i
have
you
if
you
to
be
had
if
money
get
you
i
have
you
the
neighbours
cut
up
rough
and
made
complaints
but
magsman
know
what
they
have
had
it
was
a
lovely
thing
first
of
all
there
was
the
canvass
representin
the
picter
of
the
giant
in
spanish
trunks
and
a
ruff
who
was
himself
half
the
heighth
of
the
house
and
was
run
up
with
a
line
and
pulley
to
a
pole
on
the
roof
so
that
his
ed
was
coeval
with
the
parapet
then
there
was
the
canvass
representin
the
picter
of
the
albina
lady
showing
her
white
air
to
the
army
and
navy
in
correct
uniform
then
there
was
the
canvass
representin
the
picter
of
the
wild
indian
a
scalpin
a
member
of
some
foreign
nation
then
there
was
the
canvass
representin
the
picter
of
a
child
of
a
british
planter
seized
by
two
boa
constrictors
not
that
never
had
no
child
nor
no
constrictors
neither
similarly
there
was
the
canvass
representin
the
picter
of
the
wild
ass
of
the
prairies
not
that
never
had
no
wild
asses
nor
would
have
had
at
a
gift
last
there
was
the
canvass
representin
the
picter
of
the
dwarf
and
like
him
too
considerin
with
george
the
fourth
in
such
a
state
of
astonishment
at
him
as
his
majesty
could
with
his
utmost
politeness
and
stoutness
express
the
front
of
the
house
was
so
covered
with
canvasses
that
there
was
a
spark
of
daylight
ever
visible
on
that
side
magsman
amusements
fifteen
foot
long
by
two
foot
high
ran
over
the
front
door
and
parlour
winders
the
passage
was
a
arbour
of
green
baize
and
gardenstuff
a
performed
there
unceasing
and
as
to
respectability
if
threepence
ai
respectable
what
is
but
the
dwarf
is
the
principal
article
at
present
and
he
was
worth
the
money
he
was
wrote
up
as
major
tpschoffki
of
the
imperial
bulgraderian
brigade
nobody
could
pronounce
the
name
and
it
never
was
intended
anybody
should
the
public
always
turned
it
as
a
regular
rule
into
chopski
in
the
line
he
was
called
chops
partly
on
that
account
and
partly
because
his
real
name
if
he
ever
had
any
real
name
which
was
very
dubious
was
stakes
he
was
a
uncommon
small
man
he
really
was
certainly
not
so
small
as
he
was
made
out
to
be
but
where
your
dwarf
as
is
he
was
a
most
uncommon
small
man
with
a
most
uncommon
large
ed
and
what
he
had
inside
that
ed
nobody
ever
knowed
but
himself
even
supposin
himself
to
have
ever
took
stock
of
it
which
it
would
have
been
a
stiff
job
for
even
him
to
do
the
kindest
little
man
as
never
growed
spirited
but
not
proud
when
he
travelled
with
the
spotted
baby
though
he
knowed
himself
to
be
a
dwarf
and
knowed
the
baby
spots
to
be
put
upon
him
artificial
he
nursed
that
baby
like
a
mother
you
never
heerd
him
give
a
to
a
giant
he
allow
himself
to
break
out
into
strong
language
respectin
the
fat
lady
from
norfolk
but
that
was
an
affair
of
the
and
when
a
man
has
been
trifled
with
by
a
lady
and
the
preference
giv
to
a
indian
he
ai
master
of
his
actions
he
was
always
in
love
of
course
every
human
phenomenon
is
and
he
was
always
in
love
with
a
large
woman
i
never
knowed
the
dwarf
as
could
be
got
to
love
a
small
one
which
helps
to
keep
the
curiosities
they
are
one
idea
he
had
in
that
ed
of
his
which
must
have
meant
something
or
it
would
have
been
there
it
was
always
his
opinion
that
he
was
entitled
to
property
he
never
would
put
his
name
to
anything
he
had
been
taught
to
write
by
the
young
man
without
arms
who
got
his
living
with
his
toes
quite
a
writing
master
was
and
taught
scores
in
the
line
but
chops
would
have
starved
to
death
afore
he
have
gained
a
bit
of
bread
by
putting
his
hand
to
a
paper
this
is
the
more
curious
to
bear
in
mind
because
he
had
no
property
nor
hope
of
property
except
his
house
and
a
sarser
when
i
say
his
house
i
mean
the
box
painted
and
got
up
outside
like
a
that
he
used
to
creep
into
with
a
diamond
ring
or
quite
as
good
to
look
at
on
his
forefinger
and
ring
a
little
bell
out
of
what
the
public
believed
to
be
the
winder
and
when
i
say
a
sarser
i
mean
a
chaney
sarser
in
which
he
made
a
collection
for
himself
at
the
end
of
every
entertainment
his
cue
for
that
he
took
from
me
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
little
man
will
now
walk
three
times
round
the
cairawan
and
retire
behind
the
curtain
when
he
said
anything
important
in
private
life
he
mostly
wound
it
up
with
this
form
of
words
and
they
was
generally
the
last
thing
he
said
to
me
at
night
afore
he
went
to
bed
he
had
what
i
consider
a
fine
mind
a
poetic
mind
his
ideas
respectin
his
property
never
come
upon
him
so
strong
as
when
he
sat
upon
a
organ
and
had
the
handle
turned
arter
the
wibration
had
run
through
him
a
little
time
he
would
screech
out
toby
i
feel
my
property
coming
grind
away
i
counting
my
guineas
by
thousands
toby
grind
away
toby
i
shall
be
a
man
of
fortun
i
feel
the
mint
a
jingling
in
me
toby
and
i
swelling
out
into
the
bank
of
england
such
is
the
influence
of
music
on
a
poetic
mind
not
that
he
was
partial
to
any
other
music
but
a
on
the
contrary
hated
it
he
had
a
kind
of
a
everlasting
grudge
agin
the
public
which
is
a
thing
you
may
notice
in
many
phenomenons
that
get
their
living
out
of
it
what
riled
him
most
in
the
nater
of
his
occupation
was
that
it
kep
him
out
of
society
he
was
continiwally
saying
toby
my
ambition
is
to
go
into
society
the
curse
of
my
position
towards
the
public
is
that
it
keeps
me
hout
of
society
this
do
signify
to
a
low
beast
of
a
indian
he
a
formed
for
society
this
do
signify
to
a
spotted
baby
formed
for
i
am
nobody
never
could
make
out
what
chops
done
with
his
money
he
had
a
good
salary
down
on
the
drum
every
saturday
as
the
day
came
round
besides
having
the
run
of
his
teeth
and
he
was
a
woodpecker
to
eat
but
all
dwarfs
are
the
sarser
was
a
little
income
bringing
him
in
so
many
halfpence
that
he
carry
for
a
week
together
tied
up
in
a
handkercher
and
yet
he
never
had
money
and
it
could
be
the
fat
lady
from
norfolk
as
was
once
supposed
because
it
stands
to
reason
that
when
you
have
a
animosity
towards
a
indian
which
makes
you
grind
your
teeth
at
him
to
his
face
and
which
can
hardly
hold
you
from
goosing
him
audible
when
he
going
through
his
it
stands
to
reason
you
would
under
them
circumstances
deprive
yourself
to
support
that
indian
in
the
lap
of
luxury
most
unexpected
the
mystery
come
out
one
day
at
egham
races
the
public
was
shy
of
bein
pulled
in
and
chops
was
ringin
his
little
bell
out
of
his
winder
and
was
snarlin
to
me
over
his
shoulder
as
he
kneeled
down
with
his
legs
out
at
the
for
he
could
be
shoved
into
his
house
without
kneeling
down
and
the
premises
accommodate
his
legs
was
snarlin
here
a
precious
public
for
you
why
the
devil
do
they
tumble
up
when
a
man
in
the
crowd
holds
up
a
and
cries
out
if
there
any
person
here
as
has
got
a
ticket
the
lottery
just
drawed
and
the
number
as
has
come
up
for
the
great
prize
is
three
seven
three
seven
i
was
givin
the
man
to
the
furies
myself
for
calling
off
the
attention
for
the
public
will
turn
away
at
any
time
to
look
at
anything
in
preference
to
the
thing
showed
and
if
you
doubt
it
get
together
for
any
indiwidual
purpose
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
send
only
two
people
in
late
and
see
if
the
whole
company
a
far
more
interested
in
takin
particular
notice
of
them
two
than
of
you
i
say
i
was
best
pleased
with
the
man
for
callin
out
and
was
blessin
him
in
my
own
mind
when
i
see
chops
little
bell
fly
out
of
winder
at
a
old
lady
and
he
gets
up
and
kicks
his
box
over
exposin
the
whole
secret
and
he
catches
hold
of
the
calves
of
my
legs
and
he
says
to
me
carry
me
into
the
wan
toby
and
throw
a
pail
of
water
over
me
or
i
a
dead
man
for
i
come
into
my
property
twelve
thousand
odd
hundred
pound
was
chops
winnins
he
had
bought
a
for
the
thousand
prize
and
it
had
come
up
the
first
use
he
made
of
his
property
was
to
offer
to
fight
the
wild
indian
for
five
hundred
pound
a
side
him
with
a
poisoned
and
the
indian
with
a
club
but
the
indian
being
in
want
of
backers
to
that
amount
it
went
no
further
arter
he
had
been
mad
for
a
week
in
a
state
of
mind
in
short
in
which
if
i
had
let
him
sit
on
the
organ
for
only
two
minutes
i
believe
he
would
have
bust
but
we
kep
the
organ
from
him
mr
chops
come
round
and
behaved
liberal
and
beautiful
to
all
he
then
sent
for
a
young
man
he
knowed
as
had
a
wery
genteel
appearance
and
was
a
bonnet
at
a
booth
most
respectable
brought
up
father
havin
been
imminent
in
the
livery
stable
line
but
in
a
commercial
crisis
through
paintin
a
old
gray
and
sellin
him
with
a
pedigree
and
mr
chops
said
to
this
bonnet
who
said
his
name
was
normandy
which
it
was
normandy
i
a
goin
into
society
will
you
go
with
me
says
normandy
do
i
understand
you
mr
chops
to
hintimate
that
the
of
the
expenses
of
that
move
will
be
borne
by
yourself
correct
says
mr
chops
and
you
shall
have
a
princely
allowance
too
the
bonnet
lifted
mr
chops
upon
a
chair
to
shake
hands
with
him
and
replied
in
poetry
with
his
eyes
seemingly
full
of
tears
my
boat
is
on
the
shore
and
my
bark
is
on
the
sea
and
i
do
not
ask
for
more
but
i
go
along
with
thee
they
went
into
society
in
a
chay
and
four
grays
with
silk
jackets
they
took
lodgings
in
pall
mall
london
and
they
blazed
away
in
consequence
of
a
note
that
was
brought
to
bartlemy
fair
in
the
autumn
of
next
year
by
a
servant
most
wonderful
got
up
in
cords
and
tops
i
cleaned
myself
and
went
to
pall
mall
one
evening
appinted
the
gentlemen
was
at
their
wine
arter
dinner
and
mr
chops
eyes
was
more
fixed
in
that
ed
of
his
than
i
thought
good
for
him
there
was
three
of
in
company
i
mean
and
i
knowed
the
third
well
when
last
met
he
had
on
a
white
roman
shirt
and
a
bishop
mitre
covered
with
skin
and
played
the
clarionet
all
wrong
in
a
band
at
a
wild
beast
show
this
gent
took
on
not
to
know
me
and
mr
chops
said
gentlemen
this
is
a
old
friend
of
former
days
and
normandy
looked
at
me
through
a
glass
and
said
magsman
glad
to
see
you
which
i
take
my
oath
he
was
mr
chops
to
git
him
convenient
to
the
table
had
his
chair
on
a
throne
much
of
the
form
of
george
the
fourth
in
the
canvass
but
he
hardly
appeared
to
me
to
be
king
there
in
any
other
pint
of
view
for
his
two
gentlemen
ordered
about
like
emperors
they
was
all
dressed
like
day
gorgeous
and
as
to
wine
they
swam
in
all
sorts
i
made
the
round
of
the
bottles
first
separate
to
say
i
had
done
it
and
then
mixed
all
together
to
say
i
had
done
it
and
then
tried
two
of
as
and
then
two
altogether
i
passed
a
pleasin
evenin
but
with
a
tendency
to
feel
muddled
until
i
considered
it
good
manners
to
get
up
and
say
mr
chops
the
best
of
friends
must
part
i
thank
you
for
the
wariety
of
foreign
drains
you
have
stood
so
i
looks
towards
you
in
red
wine
and
i
takes
my
leave
mr
chops
replied
if
you
just
hitch
me
out
of
this
over
your
right
arm
magsman
and
carry
me
i
see
you
out
i
said
i
think
of
such
a
thing
but
he
would
have
it
so
i
lifted
him
off
his
throne
he
smelt
strong
of
maideary
and
i
could
help
thinking
as
i
carried
him
down
that
it
was
like
carrying
a
large
bottle
full
of
wine
with
a
rayther
ugly
stopper
a
good
deal
out
of
proportion
when
i
set
him
on
the
in
the
hall
he
kep
me
close
to
him
by
holding
on
to
my
and
he
whispers
i
ai
magsman
what
on
your
mind
mr
chops
they
do
use
me
well
they
a
grateful
to
me
they
puts
me
on
the
when
i
wo
have
in
more
and
they
locks
me
in
the
sideboard
when
i
wo
give
up
my
property
get
rid
of
mr
chops
i
ca
we
in
society
together
and
what
would
society
say
come
out
of
society
says
i
i
ca
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
when
you
have
once
gone
into
society
you
must
come
out
of
it
then
if
you
excuse
the
freedom
mr
chops
were
my
remark
shaking
my
head
grave
i
think
it
a
pity
you
ever
went
in
mr
chops
shook
that
deep
ed
of
his
to
a
surprisin
extent
and
slapped
it
half
a
dozen
times
with
his
hand
and
with
more
wice
than
i
thought
were
in
him
then
he
says
you
a
good
fellow
but
you
understand
go
along
magsman
the
little
man
will
now
walk
three
times
round
the
cairawan
and
retire
behind
the
curtain
the
last
i
see
of
him
on
that
occasion
was
his
tryin
on
the
extremest
werge
of
insensibility
to
climb
up
the
stairs
one
by
one
with
his
hands
and
knees
they
have
been
much
too
steep
for
him
if
he
had
been
sober
but
he
would
be
helped
it
war
long
after
that
that
i
read
in
the
newspaper
of
mr
being
presented
at
court
it
was
printed
it
will
be
recollected
and
i
noticed
in
my
life
that
it
is
sure
to
be
printed
that
it
be
recollected
whenever
it
wo
that
mr
chops
is
the
individual
of
small
stature
whose
brilliant
success
in
the
last
state
lottery
attracted
so
much
attention
well
i
says
to
myself
such
is
life
he
has
been
and
done
it
in
earnest
at
last
he
has
astonished
george
the
fourth
on
account
of
which
i
had
that
canvass
him
with
a
bag
of
money
in
his
hand
a
presentin
it
to
george
the
fourth
and
a
lady
in
ostrich
feathers
fallin
in
love
with
him
in
a
sword
and
buckles
correct
i
took
the
house
as
is
the
subject
of
present
inquiries
though
not
the
honour
of
bein
acquainted
and
i
run
magsman
amusements
in
it
thirteen
months
sometimes
one
thing
sometimes
another
sometimes
nothin
particular
but
always
all
the
canvasses
outside
one
night
when
we
had
played
the
last
company
out
which
was
a
shy
company
through
its
raining
heavens
hard
i
was
takin
a
pipe
in
the
one
pair
back
along
with
the
young
man
with
the
toes
which
i
had
taken
on
for
a
month
though
he
never
drawed
except
on
paper
and
i
heard
a
kickin
at
the
street
door
halloa
i
says
to
the
young
man
what
up
he
rubs
his
eyebrows
with
his
toes
and
he
says
i
ca
imagine
magsman
which
he
never
could
imagine
nothin
and
was
monotonous
company
the
noise
not
leavin
off
i
laid
down
my
pipe
and
i
took
up
a
candle
and
i
went
down
and
opened
the
door
i
looked
out
into
the
street
but
nothin
could
i
see
and
nothin
was
i
aware
of
until
i
turned
round
quick
because
some
creetur
run
between
my
legs
into
the
passage
there
was
mr
chops
magsman
he
says
take
me
on
the
old
terms
and
you
got
me
if
it
done
say
done
i
was
all
of
a
maze
but
i
said
done
sir
done
to
your
done
and
double
done
says
he
have
you
got
a
bit
of
supper
in
the
house
bearin
in
mind
them
sparklin
warieties
of
foreign
drains
as
we
guzzled
away
at
in
pall
mall
i
was
ashamed
to
offer
him
cold
sassages
and
but
he
took
both
and
took
free
havin
a
chair
for
his
table
and
sittin
down
at
it
on
a
stool
like
hold
times
i
all
of
a
maze
all
the
while
it
was
arter
he
had
made
a
clean
sweep
of
the
sassages
beef
and
to
the
best
of
my
calculations
two
pound
and
a
quarter
that
the
wisdom
as
was
in
that
little
man
began
to
come
out
of
him
like
prespiration
magsman
he
says
look
upon
me
you
see
afore
you
one
as
has
both
gone
into
society
and
come
out
o
you
out
of
it
mr
chops
how
did
you
get
out
sir
sold
out
says
he
you
never
saw
the
like
of
the
wisdom
as
his
ed
expressed
when
he
made
use
of
them
two
words
my
friend
magsman
i
impart
to
you
a
discovery
i
made
wallable
it
cost
twelve
thousand
five
hundred
pound
it
may
do
you
good
in
life
the
secret
of
this
matter
is
that
it
ai
so
much
that
a
person
goes
into
society
as
that
society
goes
into
a
person
not
exactly
keepin
up
with
his
meanin
i
shook
my
head
put
on
a
deep
look
and
said
you
right
there
mr
chops
magsman
he
says
twitchin
me
by
the
leg
society
has
gone
into
me
to
the
tune
of
every
penny
of
my
property
i
felt
that
i
went
pale
and
though
a
bold
speaker
i
hardly
say
where
normandy
bolted
with
the
plate
said
mr
chops
and
one
meaning
him
as
formerly
wore
the
bishop
mitre
bolted
with
the
jewels
said
mr
chops
i
sat
down
and
looked
at
him
and
he
stood
up
and
looked
at
me
magsman
he
says
and
he
seemed
to
myself
to
get
wiser
as
he
got
hoarser
society
taken
in
the
lump
is
all
dwarfs
at
the
court
of
james
they
was
all
a
doing
my
old
business
all
a
goin
three
times
round
the
cairawan
in
the
hold
and
properties
elsewheres
they
was
most
of
ringin
their
little
bells
out
of
everywheres
the
sarser
was
a
goin
round
magsman
the
sarser
is
the
uniwersal
institution
i
perceived
you
understand
that
he
was
soured
by
his
misfortunes
and
i
felt
for
mr
chops
as
to
fat
ladies
he
says
giving
his
head
a
tremendious
one
agin
the
wall
there
lots
of
in
society
and
worse
than
the
original
was
a
outrage
upon
taste
simply
a
outrage
upon
taste
awakenin
contempt
carryin
its
own
punishment
in
the
form
of
a
indian
here
he
giv
himself
another
tremendious
one
but
magsman
is
mercenary
outrages
lay
in
cashmeer
shawls
buy
bracelets
strew
and
a
lot
of
fans
and
things
about
your
rooms
let
it
be
known
that
you
give
away
like
water
to
all
as
come
to
admire
and
the
fat
ladies
that
do
exhibit
for
so
much
down
upon
the
drum
will
come
from
all
the
pints
of
the
compass
to
flock
about
you
whatever
you
are
they
drill
holes
in
your
magsman
like
a
cullender
and
when
you
no
more
left
to
give
they
laugh
at
you
to
your
face
and
leave
you
to
have
your
bones
picked
dry
by
wulturs
like
the
dead
wild
ass
of
the
prairies
that
you
deserve
to
be
here
he
giv
himself
the
most
tremendious
one
of
all
and
dropped
i
thought
he
was
gone
his
ed
was
so
heavy
and
he
knocked
it
so
hard
and
he
fell
so
stoney
and
the
sassagerial
disturbance
in
him
must
have
been
so
immense
that
i
thought
he
was
gone
but
he
soon
come
round
with
care
and
he
sat
up
on
the
floor
and
he
said
to
me
with
wisdom
comin
out
of
his
eyes
if
ever
it
come
magsman
the
most
material
difference
between
the
two
states
of
existence
through
which
your
unhappy
friend
has
passed
he
reached
out
his
poor
little
hand
and
his
tears
dropped
down
on
the
moustachio
which
it
was
a
credit
to
him
to
have
done
his
best
to
grow
but
it
is
not
in
mortals
to
command
success
the
difference
this
when
i
was
out
of
society
i
was
paid
light
for
being
seen
when
i
went
into
society
i
paid
heavy
for
being
seen
i
prefer
the
former
even
if
i
was
forced
upon
it
give
me
out
through
the
trumpet
in
the
hold
way
arter
that
he
slid
into
the
line
again
as
easy
as
if
he
had
been
iled
all
over
but
the
organ
was
kep
from
him
and
no
allusions
was
ever
made
when
a
company
was
in
to
his
property
he
got
wiser
every
day
his
views
of
society
and
the
public
was
luminous
bewilderin
awful
and
his
ed
got
bigger
and
bigger
as
his
wisdom
expanded
it
he
took
well
and
pulled
in
most
excellent
for
nine
weeks
at
the
expiration
of
that
period
when
his
ed
was
a
sight
he
expressed
one
evenin
the
last
company
havin
been
turned
out
and
the
door
shut
a
wish
to
have
a
little
music
mr
chops
i
said
i
never
dropped
the
with
him
the
world
might
do
it
but
not
me
mr
chops
are
you
sure
as
you
are
in
a
state
of
mind
and
body
to
sit
upon
the
organ
his
answer
was
this
toby
when
next
met
with
on
the
tramp
i
forgive
her
and
the
indian
and
i
am
it
was
with
fear
and
trembling
that
i
began
to
turn
the
handle
but
he
sat
like
a
lamb
i
will
be
my
belief
to
my
dying
day
that
i
see
his
ed
expand
as
he
sat
you
may
therefore
judge
how
great
his
thoughts
was
he
sat
out
all
the
changes
and
then
he
come
off
toby
he
says
with
a
quiet
smile
the
little
man
will
now
walk
three
times
round
the
cairawan
and
retire
behind
the
curtain
when
we
called
him
in
the
morning
we
found
him
gone
into
a
much
better
society
than
mine
or
pall
mall
i
giv
mr
chops
as
comfortable
a
funeral
as
lay
in
my
power
followed
myself
as
chief
and
had
the
george
the
fourth
canvass
carried
first
in
the
form
of
a
banner
but
the
house
was
so
dismal
arterwards
that
i
giv
it
up
and
took
to
the
wan
again
i
do
triumph
said
jarber
folding
up
the
second
manuscript
and
looking
hard
at
trottle
i
do
triumph
over
this
worthy
creature
i
merely
ask
him
if
he
is
satisfied
now
how
can
he
be
anything
else
i
said
answering
for
trottle
who
sat
obstinately
silent
this
time
jarber
you
have
not
only
read
us
a
delightfully
amusing
story
but
you
have
also
answered
the
question
about
the
house
of
course
it
stands
empty
now
who
would
think
of
taking
it
after
it
had
been
turned
into
a
caravan
i
looked
at
trottle
as
i
said
those
last
words
and
jarber
waved
his
hand
indulgently
in
the
same
direction
let
this
excellent
person
speak
said
jarber
you
were
about
to
say
my
good
man
i
only
wished
to
ask
sir
said
trottle
doggedly
if
you
could
kindly
oblige
me
with
a
date
or
two
in
connection
with
that
last
story
a
date
repeated
jarber
what
does
the
man
want
with
dates
i
should
be
glad
to
know
with
great
respect
persisted
trottle
if
the
person
named
magsman
was
the
last
tenant
who
lived
in
the
house
my
opinion
if
i
may
be
excused
for
giving
it
that
he
most
decidedly
was
not
with
those
words
trottle
made
a
low
bow
and
quietly
left
the
room
there
is
no
denying
that
jarber
when
we
were
left
together
looked
sadly
discomposed
he
had
evidently
forgotten
to
inquire
about
dates
and
in
spite
of
his
magnificent
talk
about
his
series
of
discoveries
it
was
quite
as
plain
that
the
two
stories
he
had
just
read
had
really
and
truly
exhausted
his
present
stock
i
thought
myself
bound
in
common
gratitude
to
help
him
out
of
his
embarrassment
by
a
timely
suggestion
so
i
proposed
that
he
should
come
to
tea
again
on
the
next
monday
evening
the
thirteenth
and
should
make
such
inquiries
in
the
meantime
as
might
enable
him
to
dispose
triumphantly
of
trottle
objection
he
gallantly
kissed
my
hand
made
a
neat
little
speech
of
acknowledgment
and
took
his
leave
for
the
rest
of
the
week
i
would
not
encourage
trottle
by
allowing
him
to
refer
to
the
house
at
all
i
suspected
he
was
making
his
own
inquiries
about
dates
but
i
put
no
questions
to
him
on
monday
evening
the
thirteenth
that
dear
unfortunate
jarber
came
punctual
to
the
appointed
time
he
looked
so
terribly
harassed
that
he
was
really
quite
a
spectacle
of
feebleness
and
fatigue
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
question
of
dates
had
gone
against
him
that
magsman
had
not
been
the
last
tenant
of
the
house
and
that
the
reason
of
its
emptiness
was
still
to
seek
what
i
have
gone
through
said
jarber
words
are
not
eloquent
enough
to
tell
o
sophonisba
i
have
begun
another
series
of
discoveries
accept
the
last
two
as
stories
laid
on
your
shrine
and
wait
to
blame
me
for
leaving
your
curiosity
unappeased
until
you
have
heard
number
three
number
three
looked
like
a
very
short
manuscript
and
i
said
as
much
jarber
explained
to
me
that
we
were
to
have
some
poetry
this
time
in
the
course
of
his
investigations
he
had
stepped
into
the
circulating
library
to
seek
for
information
on
the
one
important
subject
all
the
knew
about
the
house
was
that
a
female
relative
of
the
last
tenant
as
they
believed
had
just
after
that
tenant
left
sent
a
little
manuscript
poem
to
them
which
she
described
as
referring
to
events
that
had
actually
passed
in
the
house
and
which
she
wanted
the
proprietor
of
the
library
to
publish
she
had
written
no
address
on
her
letter
and
the
proprietor
had
kept
the
manuscript
ready
to
be
given
back
to
her
the
publishing
of
poems
not
being
in
his
line
when
she
might
call
for
it
she
had
never
called
for
it
and
the
poem
had
been
lent
to
jarber
at
his
express
request
to
read
to
me
before
he
began
i
rang
the
bell
for
trottle
being
determined
to
have
him
present
at
the
new
reading
as
a
wholesome
check
on
his
obstinacy
to
my
surprise
peggy
answered
the
bell
and
told
me
that
trottle
had
stepped
out
without
saying
where
i
instantly
felt
the
strongest
possible
conviction
that
he
was
at
his
old
tricks
and
that
his
stepping
out
in
the
evening
without
leave
meant
philandering
controlling
myself
on
my
visitor
account
i
dismissed
peggy
stifled
my
indignation
and
prepared
as
politely
as
might
be
to
listen
to
jarber
three
evenings
in
the
house
number
one
i
yes
it
look
dark
and
dreary
that
long
and
narrow
street
only
the
sound
of
the
rain
and
the
tramp
of
passing

the
duller
glow
of
the
fire
and
gathering
mists
of
night

mark
how
slow
and
weary
the
long
day
cheerless
flight
ii
watching
the
sullen
fire
hearing
the
dreary
rain
drop
after
drop
run
down
on
the
darkening
chill
was
the
heart
of
bertha
chill
as
that
winter
day
for
the
star
of
her
life
had
risen
only
to
fade
away
iii
the
voice
that
had
been
so
strong
to
bid
the
snare
depart
the
true
and
earnest
will
and
the
calm
and
steadfast
heart
were
now
weigh
down
by
sorrow
were
quivering
now
with
pain
the
clear
path
now
seem
clouded
and
all
her
grief
in
vain
iv
duty
right
truth
who
promised
to
help
and
save
their
own
seem
spreading
wide
their
pinions
to
leave
her
there
alone
so
turning
from
the
present
to
days
of
yore
she
call
on
them
to
strengthen
and
guard
her
soul
once
more
she
thought
how
in
her
girlhood
her
life
was
given
away
the
solemn
promise
spoken
she
kept
so
well
how
to
her
brother
herbert
she
had
been
help
and
guide
and
how
his
on
her
calm
strength
relied
vi
how
through
life
fret
and
turmoil
the
passion
and
fire
of
art
in
him
was
soothed
and
by
her
true
sister
heart
how
future
hopes
had
always
been
for
his
sake
alone
and
now
what
strange
new
feeling
possess
her
as
its
own
vii
her
home
each
flower
that
breathed
there
the
wind
sigh
soft
and
low
each
trembling
spray
of
ivy
the
river
murmuring
flow
the
shadow
of
the
forest
sunset
or
twilight
dim
dear
as
they
were
were
dearer
by
leaving
them
for
him
viii
and
each
year
as
it
found
her
in
the
dull
feverish
town
saw
self
still
more
forgotten
and
selfish
care
kept
down
by
the
calm
joy
of
evening
that
brought
him
to
her
side
to
warn
him
with
wise
counsel
or
praise
with
tender
pride
ix
her
heart
her
life
her
future
her
genius
only
meant
another
thing
to
give
him
and
be
therewith
content
what
words
had
stirr
her
her
soul
could
not
forget
what
dream
had
fill
her
spirit
with
strange
and
wild
regret
x
to
leave
him
for
another
could
it
indeed
be
so
could
it
have
cost
such
anguish
to
bid
this
vision
go
was
this
her
faith
was
herbert
the
second
in
her
heart
did
it
need
all
this
struggle
to
bid
a
dream
depart
xi
and
yet
within
her
spirit
a
land
was
seen
a
home
which
might
have
held
her
a
love
which
might
have
been
and
life
not
the
mere
being
of
daily
ebb
and
flow
but
life
itself
had
claim
her
and
she
had
let
it
go
xii
within
her
heart
there
again
the
tune
that
promised
this
bright
future
and
ask
her
for
its
own
then
words
of
sorrow
broken
by
pain
and
then
a
farewell
spoken
in
words
of
cold
disdain
xiii
where
now
was
the
stern
purpose
that
nerved
her
soul
so
long
whence
came
the
words
she
utter
so
hard
so
cold
so
strong
what
right
had
she
to
banish
a
hope
that
god
had
given
why
must
she
choose
earth
portion
and
turn
aside
from
heaven
xiv
was
it
this
morning
if
this
long
fearful
strife
was
but
the
work
of
hours
what
would
be
years
of
life
why
did
a
cruel
heaven
for
such
great
suffering
call
and
why
o
still
more
cruel
must
her
own
words
do
all
xv
did
she
repent
o
sorrow
why
do
we
linger
still
to
take
thy
loving
message
and
do
thy
gentle
will
see
her
tears
fall
more
slowly
the
passionate
murmurs
cease
and
back
upon
her
spirit
flow
strength
and
love
and
peace
xvi
the
fire
burns
more
brightly
the
rain
has
passed
away
herbert
will
see
no
shadow
upon
his
home
only
that
bertha
greets
him
with
doubly
tender
care
kissing
a
fonder
blessing
down
on
his
golden
hair
number

i
the
studio
is
deserted

and
brush
laid
by
the
sketch
rests
on
the
easel
the
paint
is
scarcely
dry
and
silence
who
seems
always
within
her
depths
to
bear
the
next
sound
that
will
utter
now
holds
a
dumb
despair
ii
so
bertha
feels
it
listening
with
breathless
stony
fear
waiting
the
dreadful
summons
each
minute
brings
more
near
when
the
young
life
now
ebbing
shall
fail
and
pass
away
into
that
mighty
shadow
who
shrouds
the
house
iii
but
why
when
the
sick
chamber
is
on
the
upper
floor
why
dares
not
bertha
enter
within
the
door
if
he
her
all
her
brother
lies
dying
in
that
gloom
what
strange
mysterious
power
has
sent
her
from
the
room
iv
it
is
not
one
week
anguish
that
can
have
changed
her
so
joy
has
not
died
here
lately
struck
down
by
one
quick
blow
but
cruel
months
have
needed
their
long
relentless
chain
to
teach
that
shrinking
manner
of
helpless
hopeless
pain
the
struggle
was
scarce
over
last
christmas
eve
had
brought
the
fibres
still
were
quivering
of
the
one
wounded
thought
when
herbert
who
unconscious
had
guessed
no
inward
strife
bade
her
in
pride
and
pleasure
welcome
his
fair
young
wife
vi
bade
her
rejoice
and
smiling
although
his
eyes
were
dim
thank
god
he
thus
could
pay
her
the
care
she
gave
to
him
this
fresh
bright
life

bring
her
a
new
and
joyous
fate

the
murmur
that
cries
too
late
too
late

too
late
could
she
have
known
it
a
few
short
weeks
before
that
his
life
was
completed
and
needing
hers
no
more
she
might

repining
what
might
have
been

suffice
us
to

needed
her
no
longer
each
day

grew
more
plain

startled

with

by

times

told
where
was
the
worthless
gilding

where

slowly

surely
ever

drove
bertha
from
his
side
and
spite
of
nervous
effort
to
share
their
alter
life
she
felt
a
check
to
herbert
a
burden
to
his

this
was
the
least
for
bertha
fear
dreaded
at
length
how
much
his

owed

now
when

words

not

given
the
bride

one
short

figure
passes
slowly
from

room
and
pausing
at
each
doorway
seems
gathering
up
again
within
her
heart
the
relics

bygone
joy
and
pain

there
is
an

tell
herbert

not
the

beguile
that
turn

so
from
that
little
household
the
worst
gloom
pass
away
the
one
bright
hour
of
evening
lit
up
the
livelong
day
viii
days
passed
the
golden
summer
in
sudden
heat
bore
down
its
blue
bright
glowing
sweetness
upon
the
scorching
town
and
sights
and
sounds
of
country
came
in
the
warm
soft
tune
sung
by
the
honey
breezes
borne
on
the
wings
of
june
ix
one
twilight
hour
but
earlier
than
usual
bertha
thought
she
knew
the
fresh
sweet
fragrance
of
flowers
that
leonard
brought
through
open
doors
and
windows
it
stole
up
through
the
gloom
and
with
appealing
sweetness
drew
bertha
from
her
room
x
yes
he
was
there
and
pausing
just
near
the
open
door
to
check
her
heart
quick
beating
she
heard
and
paused
still
more
his
low
voice
dora
answers
his
pleading
yes
she
knew
the
tone
the
words
the
accents
she
once
had
heard
them
too
xi
would
bertha
blame
her
low
tender
answer
came
bertha
was
far
too
noble
to
think
or
dream
of
blame
and
was
he
sure
he
loved
her
yes
with
the
one
love
given
once
in
a
lifetime
only
with
one
soul
and
one
heaven
xii
then
came
a
plaintive
murmur
dora
had
once
been
told
that
he
and
bertha
dearest
bertha
is
far
too
cold
to
love
and
i
my
dora
if
once
i
fancied
so
it
was
a
brief
delusion
and
over
long
ago
xiii
between
the
past
and
present
on
that
bleak
moment
height
she
stood
as
some
lost
traveller
by
a
quick
flash
of
light
seeing
a
gulf
before
him
with
dizzy
sick
despair
reels
to
clutch
backward
but
to
find
a
deeper
chasm
there
xiv
the
twilight
grew
still
darker
the
fragrant
flowers
more
sweet
the
stars
shone
out
in
heaven
the
lamps
gleam
down
the
street
and
hours
pass
in
dreaming
over
their
fate
ere
they
could
think
of
wondering
why
bertha
was
so
late
xv
she
came
and
calmly
listen
in
vain
they
strove
to
trace
if
herbert
memory
in
grief
upon
her
face
no
blame
no
wonder
show
there
no
feeling
could
be
told
her
voice
was
not
less
steady
her
manner
not
more
cold
xvi
they
could
not
hear
the
anguish
that
broke
in
words
of
pain
through
that
calm
summer
midnight
my
herbert
mine
again
yes
they
have
once
been
parted
but
this
day
shall
restore
the
long
lost
one
she
claims
him
my
herbert
mine
once
more
xvii
now
christmas
eve
returning
saw
bertha
stand
beside
the
altar
greeting
dora
again
a
smiling
bride
and
now
the
gloomy
evening
sees
bertha
pale
and
worn
leaving
the
house
for
ever
to
wander
out
forlorn
xviii
forlorn
nay
not
so
anguish
shall
do
its
work
at
length
her
soul
pass
through
the
fire
shall
gain
still
purer
strength
somewhere
there
waits
for
bertha
an
earnest
noble
part
and
meanwhile
god
is
with
her
god
and
her
own
true
heart
i
could
warmly
and
sincerely
praise
the
little
poem
when
jarber
had
done
reading
it
but
i
could
not
say
that
it
tended
in
any
degree
towards
clearing
up
the
mystery
of
the
empty
house
whether
it
was
the
absence
of
the
irritating
influence
of
trottle
or
whether
it
was
simply
fatigue
i
can
not
say
but
jarber
did
not
strike
me
that
evening
as
being
in
his
usual
spirits
and
though
he
declared
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
daunted
by
his
want
of
success
thus
far
and
that
he
was
resolutely
determined
to
make
more
discoveries
he
spoke
in
a
languid
absent
manner
and
shortly
afterwards
took
his
leave
at
rather
an
early
hour
when
trottle
came
back
and
when
i
indignantly
taxed
him
with
philandering
he
not
only
denied
the
imputation
but
asserted
that
he
had
been
employed
on
my
service
and
in
consideration
of
that
boldly
asked
for
leave
of
absence
for
two
days
and
for
a
morning
to
himself
afterwards
to
complete
the
business
in
which
he
solemnly
declared
that
i
was
interested
in
remembrance
of
his
long
and
faithful
service
to
me
i
did
violence
to
myself
and
granted
his
request
and
he
on
his
side
engaged
to
explain
himself
to
my
satisfaction
in
a
week
time
on
monday
evening
the
twentieth
a
day
or
two
before
i
sent
to
jarber
lodgings
to
ask
him
to
drop
in
to
tea
his
landlady
sent
back
an
apology
for
him
that
made
my
hair
stand
on
end
his
feet
were
in
hot
water
his
head
was
in
a
flannel
petticoat
a
green
shade
was
over
his
eyes
the
rheumatism
was
in
his
legs
and
a
was
on
his
chest
he
was
also
a
little
feverish
and
rather
distracted
in
his
mind
about
manchester
marriages
a
dwarf
and
three
evenings
or
evening
parties
his
landlady
was
not
sure
which
in
an
empty
house
with
the
water
rate
unpaid
under
these
distressing
circumstances
i
was
necessarily
left
alone
with
trottle
his
promised
explanation
began
like
jarber
discoveries
with
the
reading
of
a
written
paper
the
only
difference
was
that
trottle
introduced
his
manuscript
under
the
name
of
a
report
trottle
report
the
curious
events
related
in
these
pages
would
many
of
them
most
likely
never
have
happened
if
a
person
named
trottle
had
not
presumed
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
to
think
for
himself
the
subject
on
which
the
person
in
question
had
ventured
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
to
form
an
opinion
purely
and
entirely
his
own
was
one
which
had
already
excited
the
interest
of
his
respected
mistress
in
a
very
extraordinary
degree
or
to
put
it
in
plainer
terms
still
the
subject
was
no
other
than
the
mystery
of
the
empty
house
feeling
no
sort
of
objection
to
set
a
success
of
his
own
if
possible
side
by
side
with
a
failure
of
jarber
trottle
made
up
his
mind
one
monday
evening
to
try
what
he
could
do
on
his
own
account
towards
clearing
up
the
mystery
of
the
empty
house
carefully
dismissing
from
his
mind
all
nonsensical
notions
of
former
tenants
and
their
histories
and
keeping
the
one
point
in
view
steadily
before
him
he
started
to
reach
it
in
the
shortest
way
by
walking
straight
up
to
the
house
and
bringing
himself
face
to
face
with
the
first
person
in
it
who
opened
the
door
to
him
it
was
getting
towards
dark
on
monday
evening
the
thirteenth
of
the
month
when
trottle
first
set
foot
on
the
steps
of
the
house
when
he
knocked
at
the
door
he
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
which
he
was
about
to
investigate
except
that
the
landlord
was
an
elderly
widower
of
good
fortune
and
that
his
name
was
forley
a
small
beginning
enough
for
a
man
to
start
from
certainly
on
dropping
the
knocker
his
first
proceeding
was
to
look
down
cautiously
out
of
the
corner
of
his
right
eye
for
any
results
which
might
show
themselves
at
the
there
appeared
at
it
immediately
the
figure
of
a
woman
who
looked
up
inquisitively
at
the
stranger
on
the
steps
left
the
window
in
a
hurry
and
came
back
to
it
with
an
open
letter
in
her
hand
which
she
held
up
to
the
fading
light
after
looking
over
the
letter
hastily
for
a
moment
or
so
the
woman
disappeared
once
more
trottle
next
heard
footsteps
shuffling
and
scraping
along
the
bare
hall
of
the
house
on
a
sudden
they
ceased
and
the
sound
of
two
voices
a
shrill
persuading
voice
and
a
gruff
resisting
voice
confusedly
reached
his
ears
after
a
while
the
voices
left
off
speaking
a
chain
was
undone
a
bolt
drawn
back
the
door
opened
and
trottle
stood
face
to
face
with
two
persons
a
woman
in
advance
and
a
man
behind
her
leaning
back
flat
against
the
wall
wish
you
good
evening
sir
says
the
woman
in
such
a
sudden
way
and
in
such
a
cracked
voice
that
it
was
quite
startling
to
hear
her
chilly
weather
ai
it
sir
please
to
walk
in
you
come
from
good
forley
do
you
sir
do
you
sir
chimes
in
the
man
hoarsely
making
a
sort
of
gruff
echo
of
himself
and
chuckling
after
it
as
if
he
thought
he
had
made
a
joke
if
trottle
had
said
no
the
door
would
have
been
probably
closed
in
his
face
therefore
he
took
circumstances
as
he
found
them
and
boldly
ran
all
the
risk
whatever
it
might
be
of
saying
yes
quite
right
sir
says
the
woman
good
forley
letter
told
us
his
particular
friend
would
be
here
to
represent
him
at
dusk
on
monday
the
thirteenth
or

not
on
monday
the
thirteenth
then
on
monday
the
twentieth
at
the
same
time
without
fail
and
here

on
monday
the
thirteenth
ai

and

in
black

the
room

kep
scoured
and
clean
against
forley

and
i
fetch

candle
in
half
a
minute
it
gets
so
dark
in
the
evenings

and
how

with
the
candle

along
benjamin
come
along
benjamin
chimes
in
the
echo
and
chuckles
again
as
if
he
thought
he
had
made
another
joke
left
alone
in
the
empty
trottle
wondered
what
was
coming
next
as
he
heard
the
shuffling
scraping
footsteps
go
slowly
down
the
the
had
been
carefully
chained
up
and
bolted
behind
him
on
his
entrance
and
there
was
not
the
least
chance
of
his
being
able
to
open
it
to
effect
his
escape
without
betraying
himself
by
making
a
noise
not
being
of
the
jarber
sort
luckily
for
himself
he
took
his
situation
quietly
as
he
found
it
and
turned
his
time
while
alone
to
account
by
summing
up
in
his
own
mind
the
few
particulars
which
he
had
discovered
thus
far
he
had
found
out
first
that
forley
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
the
house
regularly
second
that
forley
being
prevented
by
illness
from
seeing
the
people
put
in
charge
as
usual
had
appointed
a
friend
to
represent
him
and
had
written
to
say
so
third
that
the
friend
had
a
choice
of
two
mondays
at
a
particular
time
in
the
evening
for
doing
his
errand
and
that
trottle
had
accidentally
hit
on
this
time
and
on
the
first
of
the
mondays
for
beginning
his
own
investigations
fourth
that
the
similarity
between
trottle
black
dress
as
servant
out
of
livery
and
the
dress
of
the
messenger
whoever
he
might
be
had
helped
the
error
by
which
trottle
was
profiting
so
far
so
good
but
what
was
the
messenger
errand
and
what
chance
was
there
that
he
might
not
come
up
and
knock
at
the
door
himself
from
minute
to
minute
on
that
very
evening
while
trottle
was
turning
over
this
last
consideration
in
his
mind
he
heard
the
shuffling
footsteps
come
up
the
stairs
again
with
a
flash
of
going
before
them
he
waited
for
the
woman
coming
in
with
some
little
anxiety
for
the
twilight
had
been
too
dim
on
his
getting
into
the
house
to
allow
him
to
see
either
her
face
or
the
man
face
at
all
clearly
the
woman
came
in
first
with
the
man
she
called
benjamin
at
her
heels
and
set
the
candle
on
the
trottle
takes
leave
to
describe
her
as
an
old
woman
awfully
lean
and
wiry
and
sharp
all
over
at
eyes
nose
and
chin
devilishly
brisk
smiling
and
restless
with
a
dirty
false
front
and
a
dirty
black
cap
and
short
fidgetty
arms
and
long
hooked
an
unnaturally
lusty
old
woman
who
walked
with
a
spring
in
her
wicked
old
feet
and
spoke
with
a
smirk
on
her
wicked
old
face
the
sort
of
old
woman
as
trottle
thinks
who
ought
to
have
lived
in
the
dark
ages
and
been
ducked
in
a
instead
of
flourishing
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
taking
charge
of
a
christian
house
you
please
to
excuse
my
son
benjamin
wo
you
sir
says
this
witch
without
a
broomstick
pointing
to
the
man
behind
her
propped
against
the
bare
wall
of
the
exactly
as
he
had
been
propped
against
the
bare
wall
of
the
passage
he
got
his
inside
dreadful
bad
again
has
my
son
benjamin
and
he
wo
go
to
bed
and
he
will
follow
me
about
the
house
and
downstairs
and
in
my
lady
chamber
as
the
song
says
you
know
it
his
indisgestion
poor
dear
that
sours
his
temper
and
makes
him
so
agravating
and
indisgestion
is
a
wearing
thing
to
the
best
of
us
ai
it
sir
ai
it
sir
chimes
in
agravating
benjamin
winking
at
the
light
like
an
owl
at
the
sunshine
trottle
examined
the
man
curiously
while
his
horrid
old
mother
was
speaking
of
him
he
found
my
son
benjamin
to
be
little
and
lean
and
slovenly
in
a
frowsy
old
that
fell
down
to
his
ragged
his
eyes
were
very
watery
his
cheeks
very
pale
and
his
lips
very
red
his
breathing
was
so
uncommonly
loud
that
it
sounded
almost
like
a
snore
his
head
rolled
helplessly
in
the
monstrous
big
collar
of
his
and
his
limp
lazy
hands
pottered
about
the
wall
on
either
side
of
him
as
if
they
were
groping
for
a
imaginary
bottle
in
plain
english
the
complaint
of
my
son
benjamin
was
drunkenness
of
the
stupid
sottish
kind
drawing
this
conclusion
easily
enough
after
a
moment
observation
of
the
man
trottle
found
himself
nevertheless
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
much
longer
than
was
necessary
on
the
ugly
drunken
face
rolling
about
in
the
monstrous
big
coat
collar
and
looking
at
it
with
a
curiosity
that
he
could
hardly
account
for
at
first
was
there
something
familiar
to
him
in
the
man
features
he
turned
away
from
them
for
an
instant
and
then
turned
back
to
him
again
after
that
second
look
the
notion
forced
itself
into
his
mind
that
he
had
certainly
seen
a
face
somewhere
of
which
that
sot
face
appeared
like
a
kind
of
slovenly
copy
where
thinks
he
to
himself
where
did
i
last
see
the
man
whom
this
agravating
benjamin
here
so
very
strongly
reminds
me
of
it
was
no
time
just
then
with
the
cheerful
old
woman
eye
searching
him
all
over
and
the
cheerful
old
woman
tongue
talking
at
him
nineteen
to
the
dozen
for
trottle
to
be
ransacking
his
memory
for
small
matters
that
had
got
into
wrong
corners
of
it
he
put
by
in
his
mind
that
very
curious
circumstance
respecting
benjamin
face
to
be
taken
up
again
when
a
fit
opportunity
offered
itself
and
kept
his
wits
about
him
in
prime
order
for
present
necessities
you
would
like
to
go
down
into
the
kitchen
would
you
says
the
witch
without
the
broomstick
as
familiar
as
if
she
had
been
mother
instead
of
benjamin
there
a
bit
of
fire
in
the
grate
and
the
sink
in
the
back
kitchen
do
smell
to
matter
much
and
uncommon
chilly
up
here
when
a
person
flesh
do
hardly
cover
a
person
bones
but
you
do
look
cold
sir
do
you
and
then
why
lord
bless
my
soul
our
little
bit
of
business
is
so
very
very
little
it
hardly
worth
while
to
go
downstairs
about
it
after
all
quite
a
game
at
business
ai
it
sir
that
what
i
call
it
with
that
her
wicked
old
eyes
settled
hungrily
on
the
region
round
about
trottle
and
she
began
to
chuckle
like
her
son
holding
out
one
of
her
skinny
hands
and
tapping
cheerfully
in
the
palm
with
the
knuckles
of
the
other
agravating
benjamin
seeing
what
she
was
about
roused
up
a
little
chuckled
and
tapped
in
imitation
of
her
got
an
idea
of
his
own
into
his
muddled
head
all
of
a
sudden
and
bolted
it
out
charitably
for
the
benefit
of
trottle
i
say
says
benjamin
settling
himself
against
the
wall
and
nodding
his
head
viciously
at
his
cheerful
old
mother
i
say
look
out
skin
you
assisted
by
these
signs
and
warnings
trottle
found
no
difficulty
in
understanding
that
the
business
referred
to
was
the
giving
and
taking
of
money
and
that
he
was
expected
to
be
the
giver
it
was
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
that
he
first
felt
decidedly
uncomfortable
and
more
than
half
inclined
to
wish
he
was
on
the
of
the
again
he
was
still
cudgelling
his
brains
for
an
excuse
to
save
his
pocket
when
the
silence
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
a
sound
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
it
was
not
at
all
loud
it
was
a
quiet
still
scraping
sound
so
faint
that
it
could
hardly
have
reached
the
quickest
ears
except
in
an
empty
house
do
you
hear
that
benjamin
says
the
old
woman
he
at
it
again
even
in
the
dark
ai
he
you
like
to
see
him
sir
says
she
turning
on
trottle
and
poking
her
grinning
face
close
to
him
only
name
it
only
say
if
you
like
to
see
him
before
we
do
our
little
bit
of
business
and
i
show
good
forley
friend
just
as
if
he
was
good
forley
himself
legs
are
all
right
whatever
may
be
i
get
younger
and
younger
and
stronger
and
stronger
and
jollier
and
jollier
every
day
that
what
i
do
do
mind
the
stairs
on
my
account
sir
if
you
like
to
see
him
him
trottle
wondered
whether
him
meant
a
man
or
a
boy
or
a
domestic
animal
of
the
male
species
whatever
it
meant
here
was
a
chance
of
putting
off
that
uncomfortable
and
better
still
a
chance
perhaps
of
finding
out
one
of
the
secrets
of
the
mysterious
house
trottle
spirits
began
to
rise
again
and
he
said
yes
directly
with
the
confidence
of
a
man
who
knew
all
about
it
benjamin
mother
took
the
candle
at
once
and
lighted
trottle
briskly
to
the
stairs
and
benjamin
himself
tried
to
follow
as
usual
but
getting
up
several
flights
of
stairs
even
helped
by
the
bannisters
was
more
with
his
particular
complaint
than
he
seemed
to
feel
himself
inclined
to
venture
on
he
sat
down
obstinately
on
the
lowest
step
with
his
head
against
the
wall
and
the
tails
of
his
big
spreading
out
magnificently
on
the
stairs
behind
him
and
above
him
like
a
dirty
imitation
of
a
court
lady
train
do
sit
there
dear
says
his
affectionate
mother
stopping
to
snuff
the
candle
on
the
first
landing
i
shall
sit
here
says
benjamin
agravating
to
the
last
till
the
milk
comes
in
the
morning
the
cheerful
old
woman
went
on
nimbly
up
the
stairs
to
the
first
floor
and
trottle
followed
with
his
eyes
and
ears
wide
open
he
had
seen
nothing
out
of
the
common
in
the
or
up
the
staircase
so
far
the
house
was
dirty
and
dreary
and
but
there
was
nothing
about
it
to
excite
the
least
curiosity
except
the
faint
scraping
sound
which
was
now
beginning
to
get
a
little
clearer
though
still
not
at
all
loud
as
trottle
followed
his
leader
up
the
stairs
to
the
second
floor
nothing
on
the
landing
but
cobwebs
above
and
bits
of
broken
plaster
below
cracked
off
from
the
ceiling
benjamin
mother
was
not
a
bit
out
of
breath
and
looked
all
ready
to
go
to
the
top
of
the
monument
if
necessary
the
faint
scraping
sound
had
got
a
little
clearer
still
but
trottle
was
no
nearer
to
guessing
what
it
might
be
than
when
he
first
heard
it
in
the
parlour
downstairs
on
the
third
and
last
floor
there
were
two
doors
one
which
was
shut
leading
into
the
front
garret
and
one
which
was
ajar
leading
into
the
back
garret
there
was
a
loft
in
the
ceiling
above
the
landing
but
the
cobwebs
all
over
it
vouched
sufficiently
for
its
not
having
been
opened
for
some
little
time
the
scraping
noise
plainer
than
ever
here
sounded
on
the
other
side
of
the
back
garret
door
and
to
great
relief
that
was
precisely
the
door
which
the
cheerful
old
woman
now
pushed
open
trottle
followed
her
in
and
for
once
in
his
life
at
any
rate
was
struck
dumb
with
amazement
at
the
sight
which
the
inside
of
the
room
revealed
to
him
the
garret
was
absolutely
empty
of
everything
in
the
shape
of
furniture
it
must
have
been
used
at
one
time
or
other
by
somebody
engaged
in
a
profession
or
a
trade
which
required
for
the
practice
of
it
a
great
deal
of
light
for
the
one
window
in
the
room
which
looked
out
on
a
wide
open
space
at
the
back
of
the
house
was
three
or
four
times
as
large
every
way
as
a
usually
is
close
under
this
window
kneeling
on
the
bare
boards
with
his
face
to
the
door
there
appeared
of
all
the
creatures
in
the
world
to
see
alone
at
such
a
place
and
at
such
a
time
a
mere
mite
of
a
child
a
little
lonely
wizen
boy
who
could
not
at
the
most
have
been
more
than
five
years
old
he
had
a
greasy
old
blue
shawl
crossed
over
his
breast
and
rolled
up
to
keep
the
ends
from
the
ground
into
a
great
big
lump
on
his
back
a
strip
of
something
which
looked
like
the
remains
of
a
woman
flannel
petticoat
showed
itself
under
the
shawl
and
below
that
again
a
pair
of
rusty
black
stockings
worlds
too
large
for
him
covered
his
legs
and
his
shoeless
feet
a
pair
of
old
clumsy
muffetees
which
had
worked
themselves
up
on
his
little
frail
red
arms
to
the
elbows
and
a
big
cotton
nightcap
that
had
dropped
down
to
his
very
eyebrows
finished
off
the
strange
dress
which
the
poor
little
man
seemed
not
half
big
enough
to
fill
out
and
not
near
strong
enough
to
walk
about
in
but
there
was
something
to
see
even
more
extraordinary
than
the
clothes
the
child
was
swaddled
up
in
and
that
was
the
game
which
he
was
playing
at
all
by
himself
and
which
moreover
explained
in
the
most
unexpected
manner
the
faint
scraping
noise
that
had
found
its
way
through
the
door
in
the
silence
of
the
empty
house
it
has
been
mentioned
that
the
child
was
on
his
knees
in
the
garret
when
trottle
first
saw
him
he
was
not
saying
his
prayers
and
not
crouching
down
in
terror
at
being
alone
in
the
dark
he
was
odd
and
unaccountable
as
it
may
appear
doing
nothing
more
or
less
than
playing
at
a
charwoman
or
housemaid
business
of
scouring
the
floor
both
his
little
hands
had
tight
hold
of
a
mangy
old
with
hardly
any
bristles
left
in
it
which
he
was
rubbing
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
boards
as
gravely
and
steadily
as
if
he
had
been
at
for
years
and
had
got
a
large
family
to
keep
by
it
the
of
trottle
and
the
old
woman
did
not
startle
or
disturb
him
in
the
least
he
just
looked
up
for
a
minute
at
the
candle
with
a
pair
of
very
bright
sharp
eyes
and
then
went
on
with
his
work
again
as
if
nothing
had
happened
on
one
side
of
him
was
a
battered
pint
saucepan
without
a
handle
which
was
his
pail
and
on
the
other
a
morsel
of
cotton
rag
which
stood
for
his
flannel
to
wipe
up
with
after
scrubbing
bravely
for
a
minute
or
two
he
took
the
bit
of
rag
and
mopped
up
and
then
squeezed
water
out
into
his
pail
as
grave
as
any
judge
that
ever
sat
on
a
bench
by
the
time
he
thought
he
had
got
the
floor
pretty
dry
he
raised
himself
upright
on
his
knees
and
blew
out
a
good
long
breath
and
set
his
little
red
arms
akimbo
and
nodded
at
trottle
there
says
the
child
knitting
his
little
downy
eyebrows
into
a
frown
drat
the
dirt
i
cleaned
up
where
my
beer
benjamin
mother
chuckled
till
trottle
thought
she
would
have
choked
herself
lord
ha
mercy
on
us
says
she
just
hear
the
imp
you
would
never
think
he
was
only
five
years
old
would
you
sir
please
to
tell
good
forley
you
saw
him
going
on
as
nicely
as
ever
playing
at
being
me
scouring
the
parlour
floor
and
calling
for
my
beer
afterwards
his
regular
game
morning
noon
and
night
he
never
tired
of
it
only
look
how
snug
we
been
and
dressed
him
that
my
shawl
a
keepin
his
precious
little
body
warm
and
benjamin
nightcap
a
keepin
his
precious
little
head
warm
and
benjamin
stockings
drawed
over
his
trowsers
a
keepin
his
precious
little
legs
warm
he
snug
and
happy
if
ever
a
imp
was
yet
my
beer
say
it
again
little
dear
say
it
again
if
trottle
had
seen
the
boy
with
a
light
and
a
fire
in
the
room
clothed
like
other
children
and
playing
naturally
with
a
top
or
a
box
of
soldiers
or
a
bouncing
big
ball
he
might
have
been
as
cheerful
under
the
circumstances
as
benjamin
mother
herself
but
seeing
the
child
reduced
as
he
could
not
help
suspecting
for
want
of
proper
toys
and
proper
child
company
to
take
up
with
the
mocking
of
an
old
woman
at
her
for
something
to
stand
in
the
place
of
a
game
trottle
though
not
a
family
man
nevertheless
felt
the
sight
before
him
to
be
in
its
way
one
of
the
saddest
and
the
most
pitiable
that
he
had
ever
witnessed
why
my
man
says
he
you
the
boldest
little
chap
in
all
england
you
do
seem
a
bit
afraid
of
being
up
here
all
by
yourself
in
the
dark
the
big
winder
says
the
child
pointing
up
to
it
sees
in
the
dark
and
i
see
with
the
big
winder
he
stops
a
bit
and
gets
up
on
his
legs
and
looks
hard
at
benjamin
mother
i
a
good
says
he
i
i
save
candle
trottle
wondered
what
else
the
forlorn
little
creature
had
been
brought
up
to
do
without
besides
and
risked
putting
a
question
as
to
whether
he
ever
got
a
run
in
the
open
air
to
cheer
him
up
a
bit
o
yes
he
had
a
run
now
and
then
out
of
doors
to
say
nothing
of
his
runs
about
the
house
the
lively
little
cricket
a
run
according
to
good
forley
instructions
which
were
followed
out
carefully
as
good
forley
friend
would
be
glad
to
hear
to
the
very
letter
as
trottle
could
only
have
made
one
reply
to
this
namely
that
good
forley
instructions
were
in
his
opinion
the
instructions
of
an
infernal
scamp
and
as
he
felt
that
such
an
answer
would
naturally
prove
the
to
all
further
discoveries
on
his
part
he
gulped
down
his
feelings
before
they
got
too
many
for
him
and
held
his
tongue
and
looked
round
towards
the
window
again
to
see
what
the
forlorn
little
boy
was
going
to
amuse
himself
with
next
the
child
had
gathered
up
his
and
bit
of
rag
and
had
put
them
into
the
old
tin
saucepan
and
was
now
working
his
way
as
well
as
his
clothes
would
let
him
with
his
pail
hugged
up
in
his
arms
towards
a
door
of
communication
which
led
from
the
back
to
the
front
garret
i
say
says
he
looking
round
sharply
over
his
shoulder
what
are
you
two
stopping
here
for
i
going
to
bed
now
and
so
i
tell
you
with
that
he
opened
the
door
and
walked
into
the
front
room
seeing
trottle
take
a
step
or
two
to
follow
him
benjamin
mother
opened
her
wicked
old
eyes
in
a
state
of
great
astonishment
mercy
on
us
says
she
have
you
seen
enough
of
him
yet
no
says
trottle
i
should
like
to
see
him
go
to
bed
benjamin
mother
burst
into
such
a
fit
of
chuckling
that
the
loose
extinguisher
in
the
candlestick
clattered
again
with
the
shaking
of
her
hand
to
think
of
good
forley
friend
taking
ten
times
more
trouble
about
the
imp
than
good
forley
himself
such
a
joke
as
that
benjamin
mother
had
not
often
met
with
in
the
course
of
her
life
and
she
begged
to
be
excused
if
she
took
the
liberty
of
having
a
laugh
at
it
leaving
her
to
laugh
as
much
as
she
pleased
and
coming
to
a
pretty
positive
conclusion
after
what
he
had
just
heard
that
interest
in
the
child
was
not
of
the
fondest
possible
kind
trottle
walked
into
the
front
room
and
benjamin
mother
enjoying
herself
immensely
followed
with
the
candle
there
were
two
pieces
of
furniture
in
the
front
garret
one
an
old
stool
of
the
sort
that
is
used
to
stand
a
cask
of
beer
on
and
the
other
a
great
big
ricketty
straddling
old
truckle
bedstead
in
the
middle
of
this
bedstead
surrounded
by
a
dim
brown
waste
of
sacking
was
a
kind
of
little
island
of
poor
bedding
an
old
bolster
with
nearly
all
the
feathers
out
of
it
doubled
in
three
for
a
pillow
a
mere
shred
of
patchwork
and
a
blanket
and
under
that
and
peeping
out
a
little
on
either
side
beyond
the
loose
clothes
two
faded
chair
cushions
of
horsehair
laid
along
together
for
a
sort
of
makeshift
mattress
when
trottle
got
into
the
room
the
lonely
little
boy
had
scrambled
up
on
the
bedstead
with
the
help
of
the
and
was
kneeling
on
the
outer
rim
of
sacking
with
the
shred
of
counterpane
in
his
hands
just
making
ready
to
tuck
it
in
for
himself
under
the
chair
cushions
i
tuck
you
up
my
man
says
trottle
jump
into
bed
and
let
me
try
i
mean
to
tuck
myself
up
says
the
poor
forlorn
child
and
i
mean
to
jump
i
mean
to
crawl
i
do
and
so
i
tell
you
with
that
he
set
to
work
tucking
in
the
clothes
tight
all
down
the
sides
of
the
cushions
but
leaving
them
open
at
the
foot
then
getting
up
on
his
knees
and
looking
hard
at
trottle
as
much
as
to
say
what
do
you
mean
by
offering
to
help
such
a
handy
little
chap
as
me
he
began
to
untie
the
big
shawl
for
himself
and
did
it
too
in
less
than
half
a
minute
then
doubling
the
shawl
up
loose
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
he
says
i
say
look
here
and
ducks
under
the
clothes
head
first
worming
his
way
up
and
up
softly
under
the
blanket
and
counterpane
till
trottle
saw
the
top
of
the
large
nightcap
slowly
peep
out
on
the
bolster
this
of
the
child
had
so
shoved
itself
down
in
the
course
of
his
journey
to
the
pillow
under
the
clothes
that
when
he
got
his
face
fairly
out
on
the
bolster
he
was
all
nightcap
down
to
his
mouth
he
soon
freed
himself
however
from
this
slight
encumbrance
by
turning
the
ends
of
the
cap
up
gravely
to
their
old
place
over
his
eyebrows
looked
at
trottle
said
snug
ai
it
popped
his
face
under
the
clothes
again
and
left
nothing
to
be
seen
of
him
but
the
empty
peak
of
the
big
nightcap
standing
up
sturdily
on
end
in
the
middle
of
the
bolster
what
a
young
limb
it
is
ai
it
says
benjamin
mother
giving
trottle
a
cheerful
dig
with
her
elbow
come
on
you
wo
see
no
more
of
him
and
so
i
tell
you
sings
out
a
shrill
little
voice
under
the
bedclothes
chiming
in
with
a
playful
finish
to
the
old
woman
last
words
if
trottle
had
not
been
by
this
time
positively
resolved
to
follow
the
wicked
secret
which
accident
had
mixed
him
up
with
through
all
its
turnings
and
windings
right
on
to
the
end
he
would
have
probably
snatched
the
boy
up
then
and
there
and
carried
him
off
from
his
garret
prison
and
all
as
it
was
he
put
a
strong
check
on
himself
kept
his
eye
on
future
possibilities
and
allowed
mother
to
lead
him
again
mind
them
top
bannisters
says
she
as
trottle
laid
his
hand
on
them
they
are
as
rotten
as
medlars
every
one
of
when
people
come
to
see
the
premises
says
trottle
trying
to
feel
his
way
a
little
farther
into
the
mystery
of
the
house
you
do
bring
many
of
them
up
here
do
you
bless
your
heart
alive
says
she
nobody
ever
comes
now
the
outside
of
the
house
is
quite
enough
to
warn
them
off
mores
the
pity
as
i
say
it
used
to
keep
me
in
spirits
staggering
all
one
after
another
with
the
frightful
high
rent
specially
the
women
drat
the
rent
of
this
house
and
twenty
pound
and
twenty
why
there
ai
a
house
in
the
street
as
lets
for
more
than
eighty
likely
enough
other
landlords
may
lower
their
rents
if
they
please
but
this
here
landlord
sticks
to
his
rights
and
means
to
have
as
much
for
his
house
as
his
father
had
before
him
the
neighbourhood
gone
off
since
then
and
twenty
pound
landlord
must
be
mad
and
twenty
pound
the
door
you
impertinent
woman
lord
what
a
happiness
it
was
to
see
bounce
out
with
that
awful
rent
in
their
ears
all
down
the
street
she
stopped
on
the
landing
to
treat
herself
to
another
chuckle
while
trottle
privately
posted
up
in
his
memory
what
he
had
just
heard
two
points
made
out
he
thought
to
himself
the
house
is
kept
empty
on
purpose
and
the
way
it
done
is
to
ask
a
rent
that
nobody
will
pay
ah
deary
me
says
benjamin
mother
changing
the
subject
on
a
sudden
and
twisting
back
with
a
horrid
greedy
quickness
to
those
awkward
matters
which
she
had
broached
down
in
the
parlour
what
we
done
one
way
and
another
for
forley
it
is
in
words
to
tell
that
nice
little
bit
of
business
of
ours
ought
to
be
a
bigger
bit
of
business
considering
the
trouble
we
take
benjamin
and
me
to
make
the
imp
upstairs
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
if
good
forley
would
only
please
to
think
a
little
more
of
what
a
deal
he
owes
to
benjamin
and
me
that
just
it
says
trottle
catching
her
up
short
in
desperation
and
seeing
his
way
by
the
help
of
those
last
words
of
hers
to
slipping
cleverly
through
her
fingers
what
should
you
say
if
i
told
you
that
forley
was
nothing
like
so
far
from
thinking
about
that
little
matter
as
you
fancy
you
would
be
disappointed
now
if
i
told
you
that
i
had
come
without
the
money
her
lank
old
jaw
fell
and
her
villainous
old
eyes
glared
in
a
perfect
state
of
panic
at
that
but
what
should
you
say
if
i
told
you
that
forley
was
only
waiting
for
my
report
to
send
me
here
next
monday
at
dusk
with
a
bigger
bit
of
business
for
us
two
to
do
together
than
ever
you
think
for
what
should
you
say
to
that
the
old
wretch
came
so
near
to
trottle
before
she
answered
and
jammed
him
up
confidentially
so
close
into
the
corner
of
the
landing
that
his
throat
in
a
manner
rose
at
her
can
you
count
it
off
do
you
think
on
more
than
that
says
she
holding
up
her
four
skinny
fingers
and
her
long
crooked
thumb
all
of
a
tremble
right
before
his
face
what
do
you
say
to
two
hands
instead
of
one
says
he
pushing
past
her
and
getting
as
fast
as
he
could
what
she
said
trottle
thinks
it
best
not
to
report
seeing
that
the
old
hypocrite
getting
next
door
to
at
the
golden
prospect
before
her
took
such
liberties
with
unearthly
names
and
persons
which
ought
never
to
have
approached
her
lips
and
rained
down
such
an
awful
shower
of
blessings
on
trottle
head
that
his
hair
almost
stood
on
end
to
hear
her
he
went
on
as
fast
as
his
feet
would
carry
him
till
he
was
brought
up
all
standing
as
the
sailors
say
on
the
last
flight
by
agravating
benjamin
lying
right
across
the
stair
and
fallen
off
as
might
have
been
expected
into
a
heavy
drunken
sleep
the
sight
of
him
instantly
reminded
trottle
of
the
curious
half
likeness
which
he
had
already
detected
between
the
face
of
benjamin
and
the
face
of
another
man
whom
he
had
seen
at
a
past
time
in
very
different
circumstances
he
determined
before
leaving
the
house
to
have
one
more
look
at
the
wretched
muddled
creature
and
accordingly
shook
him
up
smartly
and
propped
him
against
the
staircase
wall
before
his
mother
could
interfere
leave
him
to
me
i
freshen
him
up
says
trottle
to
the
old
woman
looking
hard
in
benjamin
face
while
he
spoke
the
fright
and
surprise
of
being
suddenly
woke
up
seemed
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
minute
to
sober
the
creature
when
he
first
opened
his
eyes
there
was
a
new
look
in
them
for
a
moment
which
struck
home
to
trottle
memory
as
quick
and
as
clear
as
a
flash
of
light
the
old
maudlin
sleepy
expression
came
back
again
in
another
instant
and
blurred
out
all
further
signs
and
tokens
of
the
past
but
trottle
had
seen
enough
in
the
moment
before
it
came
and
he
troubled
benjamin
face
with
no
more
inquiries
next
monday
at
dusk
says
he
cutting
short
some
more
of
the
old
woman
palaver
about
benjamin
indisgestion
i
got
no
more
time
to
spare
please
to
let
me
out
with
a
few
last
blessings
a
few
last
dutiful
messages
to
good
forley
and
a
few
last
friendly
hints
not
to
forget
next
monday
at
dusk
trottle
contrived
to
struggle
through
the
sickening
business
of
taking
to
get
the
door
opened
and
to
find
himself
to
his
own
indescribable
relief
once
more
on
the
outer
side
of
the
house
to
let
let
at
last
there
said
trottle
folding
up
the
manuscript
from
which
he
had
been
reading
and
setting
it
down
with
a
smart
tap
of
triumph
on
the
table
may
i
venture
to
ask
what
you
think
of
that
plain
statement
as
a
guess
on
my
part
and
not
on
jarber
at
the
riddle
of
the
empty
house
for
a
minute
or
two
i
was
unable
to
say
a
word
when
i
recovered
a
little
my
first
question
referred
to
the
poor
forlorn
little
boy
is
monday
the
twentieth
i
said
surely
you
have
not
let
a
whole
week
go
by
without
trying
to
find
out
something
more
except
at
and
meals
answered
trottle
i
have
not
let
an
hour
go
by
please
to
understand
that
i
have
only
come
to
an
end
of
what
i
have
written
and
not
to
an
end
of
what
i
have
done
i
wrote
down
those
first
particulars
because
they
are
of
great
importance
and
also
because
i
was
determined
to
come
forward
with
my
written
documents
seeing
that
jarber
chose
to
come
forward
in
the
first
instance
with
his
i
am
now
ready
to
go
on
with
the
second
part
of
my
story
as
shortly
and
plainly
as
possible
by
word
of
mouth
the
first
thing
i
must
clear
up
if
you
please
is
the
matter
of
forley
family
affairs
i
have
heard
you
speak
of
them
at
various
times
and
i
have
understood
that
forley
had
two
children
only
by
his
deceased
wife
both
daughters
the
eldest
daughter
married
to
her
father
entire
satisfaction
one
bayne
a
rich
man
holding
a
high
government
situation
in
canada
she
is
now
living
there
with
her
husband
and
her
only
child
a
little
girl
of
eight
or
nine
years
old
right
so
far
i
think
quite
right
i
said
the
second
daughter
trottle
went
on
and
forley
favourite
set
her
father
wishes
and
the
opinions
of
the
world
at
flat
defiance
by
running
away
with
a
man
of
low
origin
a
mate
of
a
named
kirkland
forley
not
only
never
forgave
that
marriage
but
vowed
that
he
would
visit
the
scandal
of
it
heavily
in
the
future
on
husband
and
wife
both
escaped
his
vengeance
whatever
he
meant
it
to
be
the
husband
was
drowned
on
his
first
voyage
after
his
marriage
and
the
wife
died
in
right
again
i
believe
again
quite
right
having
got
the
family
matter
all
right
we
will
now
go
back
to
me
and
my
doings
last
monday
i
asked
you
for
leave
of
absence
for
two
days
i
employed
the
time
in
clearing
up
the
matter
of
benjamin
face
last
saturday
i
was
out
of
the
way
when
you
wanted
me
i
played
truant
on
that
occasion
in
company
with
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
managing
clerk
in
a
lawyer
office
and
we
both
spent
the
morning
at
doctors
commons
over
the
last
will
and
testament
of
father
leaving
the
for
a
moment
please
to
follow
me
first
if
you
have
no
objection
into
the
ugly
subject
of
face
about
six
or
seven
years
ago
thanks
to
your
kindness
i
had
a
week
holiday
with
some
friends
of
mine
who
live
in
the
town
of
pendlebury
one
of
those
friends
the
only
one
now
left
in
the
place
kept
a
chemist
shop
and
in
that
shop
i
was
made
acquainted
with
one
of
the
two
doctors
in
the
town
named
barsham
this
barsham
was
a
rate
surgeon
and
might
have
got
to
the
top
of
his
profession
if
he
had
not
been
a
blackguard
as
it
was
he
both
drank
and
gambled
nobody
would
have
anything
to
do
with
him
in
pendlebury
and
at
the
time
when
i
was
made
known
to
him
in
the
chemist
shop
the
other
doctor
dix
who
was
not
to
be
compared
with
him
for
surgical
skill
but
who
was
a
respectable
man
had
got
all
the
practice
and
barsham
and
his
old
mother
were
living
together
in
such
a
condition
of
utter
poverty
that
it
was
a
marvel
to
everybody
how
they
kept
out
of
the
parish
workhouse
benjamin
and
benjamin
mother
exactly
last
thursday
morning
thanks
to
your
kindness
again
i
went
to
pendlebury
to
my
friend
the
chemist
to
ask
a
few
questions
about
barsham
and
his
mother
i
was
told
that
they
had
both
left
the
town
about
five
years
since
when
i
inquired
into
the
circumstances
some
strange
particulars
came
out
in
the
course
of
the
chemist
answer
you
know
i
have
no
doubt
that
poor
kirkland
was
confined
while
her
husband
was
at
sea
in
lodgings
at
a
village
called
flatfield
and
that
she
died
and
was
buried
there
but
what
you
may
not
know
is
that
flatfield
is
only
three
miles
from
pendlebury
that
the
doctor
who
attended
on
kirkland
was
barsham
that
the
nurse
who
took
care
of
her
was
barsham
mother
and
that
the
person
who
called
them
both
in
was
forley
whether
his
daughter
wrote
to
him
or
whether
he
heard
of
it
in
some
other
way
i
do
know
but
he
was
with
her
though
he
had
sworn
never
to
see
her
again
when
she
married
a
month
or
more
before
her
confinement
and
was
backwards
and
forwards
a
good
deal
between
flatfield
and
pendlebury
how
he
managed
matters
with
the
barshams
can
not
at
present
be
discovered
but
it
is
a
fact
that
he
contrived
to
keep
the
drunken
doctor
sober
to
everybody
amazement
it
is
a
fact
that
barsham
went
to
the
poor
woman
with
all
his
wits
about
him
it
is
a
fact
that
he
and
his
mother
came
back
from
flatfield
after
death
packed
up
what
few
things
they
had
and
left
the
town
mysteriously
by
night
and
lastly
it
is
also
a
fact
that
the
other
doctor
dix
was
not
called
in
to
help
till
a
week
after
the
birth
of
the
child
when
the
mother
was
sinking
from
exhaustion
exhaustion
to
give
the
vagabond
barsham
his
due
not
produced
in
dix
opinion
by
improper
medical
treatment
but
by
the
bodily
weakness
of
the
poor
woman
herself
burial
of
the
child
i
interrupted
trembling
all
over
trottle
you
spoke
that
word
in
a
very
strange
way
you
are
fixing
your
eyes
on
me
now
with
a
very
strange
look
trottle
leaned
over
close
to
me
and
pointed
through
the
window
to
the
empty
house
the
child
death
is
registered
at
pendlebury
he
said
on
certificate
under
the
head
of
male
infant
the
coffin
lies
in
the
mother
grave
in
flatfield
churchyard
the
child
himself
as
surely
as
i
live
and
breathe
is
living
and
breathing
now
a
castaway
and
a
prisoner
in
that
villainous
house
i
sank
back
in
my
chair
it
so
far
but
it
is
borne
in
on
my
mind
for
all
that
as
truth
rouse
yourself
and
think
a
little
the
last
i
hear
of
barsham
he
is
attending
forley
disobedient
daughter
the
next
i
see
of
barsham
he
is
in
forley
house
trusted
with
a
secret
he
and
his
mother
leave
pendlebury
suddenly
and
suspiciously
five
years
back
and
he
and
his
mother
have
got
a
child
of
five
years
old
hidden
away
in
the
house
wait
please
to
wait
i
have
not
done
yet
the
will
left
by
forley
father
strengthens
the
suspicion
the
friend
i
took
with
me
to
doctors
commons
made
himself
master
of
the
contents
of
that
will
and
when
he
had
done
so
i
put
these
two
questions
to
him
forley
leave
his
money
at
his
own
discretion
to
anybody
he
pleases
my
friend
says
father
has
left
him
with
only
a
life
interest
in
it
one
of
forley
married
daughters
has
a
girl
and
the
other
a
boy
how
would
the
money
go
would
all
go
my
friend
says
the
boy
and
it
would
be
charged
with
the
payment
of
a
certain
annual
income
to
his
female
cousin
after
her
death
it
would
go
back
to
the
male
descendant
and
to
his
heirs
consider
that
the
child
of
the
daughter
whom
forley
hates
whose
husband
has
been
snatched
away
from
his
vengeance
by
death
takes
his
whole
property
in
defiance
of
him
and
the
child
of
the
daughter
whom
he
loves
is
left
a
pensioner
on
her
for
life
there
was
good
too
good
reason
why
that
child
of
kirkland
should
be
registered
stillborn
and
if
as
i
believe
the
register
is
founded
on
a
false
certificate
there
is
better
still
better
reason
why
the
existence
of
the
child
should
be
hidden
and
all
trace
of
his
parentage
blotted
out
in
the
garret
of
that
empty
house
he
stopped
and
pointed
for
the
second
time
to
the
dim
opposite
as
he
did
so
i
was
startled
a
very
slight
matter
sufficed
to
frighten
me
now
by
a
knock
at
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
we
were
sitting
my
maid
came
in
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
i
took
it
from
her
the
mourning
card
which
was
all
the
envelope
enclosed
dropped
from
my
hands
george
forley
was
no
more
he
had
departed
this
life
three
days
since
on
the
evening
of
friday
did
our
last
chance
of
discovering
the
truth
i
asked
rest
with
has
it
died
with
death
courage
i
think
not
our
chance
rests
on
our
power
to
make
barsham
and
his
mother
confess
and
forley
death
by
leaving
them
helpless
seems
to
put
that
power
into
our
hands
with
your
permission
i
will
not
wait
till
dusk
as
i
at
first
intended
but
will
make
sure
of
those
two
people
at
once
with
a
policeman
in
plain
clothes
to
watch
the
house
in
case
they
try
to
leave
it
with
this
card
to
vouch
for
the
fact
of
forley
death
and
with
a
bold
acknowledgment
on
my
part
of
having
got
possession
of
their
secret
and
of
being
ready
to
use
it
against
them
in
case
of
need
i
think
there
is
little
doubt
of
bringing
barsham
and
his
mother
to
terms
in
case
i
find
it
impossible
to
get
back
here
before
dusk
please
to
sit
near
the
window
and
watch
the
house
a
little
before
they
light
the
if
you
see
the
open
and
close
again
will
you
be
good
enough
to
put
on
your
bonnet
and
come
across
to
me
immediately
forley
death
may
or
may
not
prevent
his
messenger
from
coming
as
arranged
but
if
the
person
does
come
it
is
of
importance
that
you
as
a
relative
of
forley
should
be
present
to
see
him
and
to
have
that
proper
influence
over
him
which
i
can
not
pretend
to
exercise
the
only
words
i
could
say
to
trottle
as
he
opened
the
door
and
left
me
were
words
charging
him
to
take
care
that
no
harm
happened
to
the
poor
forlorn
little
boy
left
alone
i
drew
my
chair
to
the
window
and
looked
out
with
a
beating
heart
at
the
guilty
house
i
waited
and
waited
through
what
appeared
to
me
to
be
an
endless
time
until
i
heard
the
wheels
of
a
cab
stop
at
the
end
of
the
street
i
looked
in
that
direction
and
saw
trottle
get
out
of
the
cab
alone
walk
up
to
the
house
and
knock
at
the
door
he
was
let
in
by
barsham
mother
a
minute
or
two
later
a
man
sauntered
past
the
house
looked
up
at
it
for
a
moment
and
sauntered
on
to
the
corner
of
the
street
close
by
here
he
leant
against
the
post
and
lighted
a
cigar
and
stopped
there
smoking
in
an
idle
way
but
keeping
his
face
always
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
i
waited
and
waited
still
i
waited
and
waited
with
my
eyes
riveted
to
the
door
of
the
house
at
last
i
thought
i
saw
it
open
in
the
dusk
and
then
felt
sure
i
heard
it
shut
again
softly
though
i
tried
hard
to
compose
myself
i
trembled
so
that
i
was
obliged
to
call
for
peggy
to
help
me
on
with
my
bonnet
and
cloak
and
was
forced
to
take
her
arm
to
lean
on
in
crossing
the
street
trottle
opened
the
door
to
us
before
we
could
knock
peggy
went
back
and
i
went
in
he
had
a
lighted
candle
in
his
hand
it
has
happened
as
i
thought
it
would
he
whispered
leading
me
into
the
bare
comfortless
empty
parlour
barsham
and
his
mother
have
consulted
their
own
interests
and
have
come
to
terms
my
is
no
longer
it
is
now
what
i
felt
it
was
truth
something
strange
to
me
something
which
women
who
are
mothers
must
often
know
trembled
suddenly
in
my
heart
and
brought
the
warm
tears
of
my
youthful
days
thronging
back
into
my
eyes
i
took
my
faithful
old
servant
by
the
hand
and
asked
him
to
let
me
see
kirkland
child
for
his
mother
sake
if
you
desire
it
said
trottle
with
a
gentleness
of
manner
that
i
had
never
noticed
in
him
before
but
pray
do
think
me
wanting
in
duty
and
right
feeling
if
i
beg
you
to
try
and
wait
a
little
you
are
agitated
already
and
a
first
meeting
with
the
child
will
not
help
to
make
you
so
calm
as
you
would
wish
to
be
if
forley
messenger
comes
the
little
boy
is
safe
pray
think
first
of
trying
to
compose
yourself
for
a
meeting
with
a
stranger
and
believe
me
you
shall
not
leave
the
house
afterwards
without
the
child
i
felt
that
trottle
was
right
and
sat
down
as
patiently
as
i
could
in
a
chair
he
had
thoughtfully
placed
ready
for
me
i
was
so
horrified
at
the
discovery
of
my
own
relation
wickedness
that
when
trottle
proposed
to
make
me
acquainted
with
the
confession
wrung
from
barsham
and
his
mother
i
begged
him
to
spare
me
all
details
and
only
to
tell
me
what
was
necessary
about
george
forley
all
that
can
be
said
for
forley
is
that
he
was
just
scrupulous
enough
to
hide
the
child
existence
and
blot
out
its
parentage
here
instead
of
consenting
at
the
first
to
its
death
or
afterwards
when
the
boy
grew
up
to
turning
him
adrift
absolutely
helpless
in
the
world
the
fraud
has
been
managed
with
the
cunning
of
satan
himself
forley
had
the
hold
over
the
barshams
that
they
had
helped
him
in
his
villany
and
that
they
were
dependent
on
him
for
the
bread
they
eat
he
brought
them
up
to
london
to
keep
them
securely
under
his
own
eye
he
put
them
into
this
empty
house
taking
it
out
of
the
agent
hands
previously
on
pretence
that
he
meant
to
manage
the
letting
of
it
himself
and
by
keeping
the
house
empty
made
it
the
surest
of
all
hiding
places
for
the
child
here
forley
could
come
whenever
he
pleased
to
see
that
the
poor
lonely
child
was
not
absolutely
starved
sure
that
his
visits
would
only
appear
like
looking
after
his
own
property
here
the
child
was
to
have
been
trained
to
believe
himself
barsham
child
till
he
should
be
old
enough
to
be
provided
for
in
some
situation
as
low
and
as
poor
as
forley
uneasy
conscience
would
let
him
pick
out
he
may
have
thought
of
atonement
on
his
but
not
before
i
am
only
too
certain
of
it
not
before
a
low
double
knock
startled
us
the
messenger
said
trottle
under
his
breath
he
went
out
instantly
to
answer
the
knock
and
returned
leading
in
a
elderly
man
dressed
like
trottle
all
in
black
with
a
white
cravat
but
otherwise
not
at
all
resembling
him
i
am
afraid
i
have
made
some
mistake
said
the
stranger
trottle
considerately
taking
the
office
of
explanation
into
his
own
hands
assured
the
gentleman
that
there
was
no
mistake
mentioned
to
him
who
i
was
and
asked
him
if
he
had
not
come
on
business
connected
with
the
late
forley
looking
greatly
astonished
the
gentleman
answered
yes
there
was
an
awkward
moment
of
silence
after
that
the
stranger
seemed
to
be
not
only
startled
and
amazed
but
rather
distrustful
and
fearful
of
committing
himself
as
well
noticing
this
i
thought
it
best
to
request
trottle
to
put
an
end
to
further
embarrassment
by
stating
all
particulars
truthfully
as
he
had
stated
them
to
me
and
i
begged
the
gentleman
to
listen
patiently
for
the
late
forley
sake
he
bowed
to
me
very
respectfully
and
said
he
was
prepared
to
listen
with
the
greatest
interest
it
was
evident
to
me
and
i
could
see
to
trottle
also
that
we
were
not
dealing
to
say
the
least
with
a
dishonest
man
before
i
offer
any
opinion
on
what
i
have
heard
he
said
earnestly
and
anxiously
after
trottle
had
done
i
must
be
allowed
in
justice
to
myself
to
explain
my
own
apparent
connection
with
this
very
strange
and
very
shocking
business
i
was
the
confidential
legal
adviser
of
the
late
forley
and
i
am
left
his
executor
rather
more
than
a
fortnight
back
when
forley
was
confined
to
his
room
by
illness
he
sent
for
me
and
charged
me
to
call
and
pay
a
certain
sum
of
money
here
to
a
man
and
woman
whom
i
should
find
taking
charge
of
the
house
he
said
he
had
reasons
for
wishing
the
affair
to
be
kept
a
secret
he
begged
me
so
to
arrange
my
engagements
that
i
could
call
at
this
place
either
on
monday
last
or
at
dusk
and
he
mentioned
that
he
would
write
to
warn
the
people
of
my
coming
without
mentioning
my
name
dalcott
is
my
name
as
he
did
not
wish
to
expose
me
to
any
future
importunities
on
the
part
of
the
man
and
woman
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
this
commission
struck
me
as
being
a
strange
one
but
in
my
position
with
forley
i
had
no
resource
but
to
accept
it
without
asking
questions
or
to
break
off
my
long
and
friendly
connection
with
my
client
i
chose
the
first
alternative
business
prevented
me
from
doing
my
errand
on
monday
last
and
if
i
am
here
notwithstanding
forley
unexpected
death
it
is
emphatically
because
i
understood
nothing
of
the
matter
on
knocking
at
this
door
and
therefore
felt
myself
bound
as
executor
to
clear
it
up
that
on
my
word
of
honour
is
the
whole
truth
so
far
as
i
am
personally
concerned
i
feel
quite
sure
of
it
sir
i
answered
you
mentioned
forley
death
just
now
as
unexpected
may
i
inquire
if
you
were
present
and
if
he
has
left
any
last
instructions
three
hours
before
forley
death
said
dalcott
his
medical
attendant
left
him
apparently
in
a
fair
way
of
recovery
the
change
for
the
worse
took
place
so
suddenly
and
was
accompanied
by
such
severe
suffering
to
prevent
him
from
communicating
his
last
wishes
to
any
one
when
i
reached
his
house
he
was
insensible
i
have
since
examined
his
papers
not
one
of
them
refers
to
the
present
time
or
to
the
serious
matter
which
now
occupies
us
in
the
absence
of
instructions
i
must
act
cautiously
on
what
you
have
told
me
but
i
will
be
rigidly
fair
and
just
at
the
same
time
the
first
thing
to
be
done
he
continued
addressing
himself
to
trottle
is
to
hear
what
the
man
and
woman
have
to
say
if
you
can
supply
me
with
i
will
take
their
declarations
separately
on
the
spot
in
your
presence
and
in
the
presence
of
the
policeman
who
is
watching
the
house
i
will
send
copies
of
those
declarations
accompanied
by
a
full
statement
of
the
case
to
and
bayne
in
canada
both
of
whom
know
me
well
as
the
late
forley
legal
adviser
and
i
will
suspend
all
proceedings
on
my
part
until
i
hear
from
them
or
from
their
solicitor
in
london
in
the
present
posture
of
affairs
this
is
all
i
can
safely
do
we
could
do
no
less
than
agree
with
him
and
thank
him
for
his
frank
and
honest
manner
of
meeting
us
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
send
over
the
from
my
lodgings
and
to
my
unutterable
joy
and
relief
it
was
also
readily
acknowledged
that
the
poor
little
orphan
boy
could
find
no
fitter
refuge
than
my
old
arms
were
longing
to
offer
him
and
no
safer
protection
for
the
night
than
my
roof
could
give
trottle
hastened
away
as
actively
as
if
he
had
been
a
young
man
to
fetch
the
child
down
and
he
brought
him
down
to
me
without
another
moment
of
delay
and
i
went
on
my
knees
before
the
poor
little
mite
and
embraced
him
and
asked
him
if
he
would
go
with
me
to
where
i
lived
he
held
me
away
for
a
moment
and
his
wan
shrewd
little
eyes
looked
sharp
at
me
then
he
clung
close
to
me
all
at
once
and
said
i
along
with
you
i
am
and
so
i
tell
you
for
inspiring
the
poor
neglected
child
with
this
trust
in
my
old
self
i
thanked
heaven
then
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
and
i
thank
it
now
i
bundled
the
poor
darling
up
in
my
own
cloak
and
i
carried
him
in
my
own
arms
across
the
road
peggy
was
lost
in
speechless
amazement
to
behold
me
trudging
out
of
breath
with
a
strange
pair
of
poor
little
legs
under
my
arm
but
she
began
to
cry
over
the
child
the
moment
she
saw
him
like
a
sensible
woman
as
she
always
was
and
she
still
cried
her
eyes
out
over
him
in
a
comfortable
manner
when
he
at
last
lay
fast
asleep
tucked
up
by
my
hands
in
trottle
bed
and
trottle
bless
you
my
dear
man
said
i
kissing
his
hand
as
he
looked
on
the
forlorn
baby
came
to
this
refuge
through
you
and
he
will
help
you
on
your
way
to
heaven
trottle
answered
that
i
was
his
dear
mistress
and
immediately
went
and
put
his
head
out
at
an
open
window
on
the
landing
and
looked
into
the
back
street
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
that
very
night
as
i
sat
thinking
of
the
poor
child
and
of
another
poor
child
who
is
never
to
be
thought
about
enough
at
the
idea
came
into
my
mind
which
i
have
lived
to
execute
and
in
the
realisation
of
which
i
am
the
happiest
of
women
this
day
the
executor
will
sell
that
house
trottle
said
i
not
a
doubt
of
it
if
he
can
find
a
purchaser
i
buy
it
i
have
often
seen
trottle
pleased
but
i
never
saw
him
so
perfectly
enchanted
as
he
was
when
i
confided
to
him
which
i
did
then
and
there
the
purpose
that
i
had
in
view
to
make
short
of
a
long
story
and
what
story
would
not
be
long
coming
from
the
lips
of
an
old
woman
like
me
unless
it
was
made
short
by
main
force
i
bought
the
house
bayne
had
her
father
blood
in
her
she
evaded
the
opportunity
of
forgiving
and
generous
reparation
that
was
offered
her
and
disowned
the
child
but
i
was
prepared
for
that
and
loved
him
all
the
more
for
having
no
one
in
the
world
to
look
to
but
me
i
am
getting
into
a
flurry
by
being
and
i
dare
say
i
am
as
incoherent
as
need
be
i
bought
the
house
and
i
altered
it
from
the
basement
to
the
roof
and
i
turned
it
into
a
hospital
for
sick
children
never
mind
by
what
degrees
my
little
adopted
boy
came
to
the
knowledge
of
all
the
sights
and
sounds
in
the
streets
so
familiar
to
other
children
and
so
strange
to
him
never
mind
by
what
degrees
he
came
to
be
pretty
and
childish
and
winning
and
companionable
and
to
have
pictures
and
toys
about
him
and
suitable
playmates
as
i
write
i
look
across
the
road
to
my
hospital
and
there
is
the
darling
who
has
gone
over
to
play
nodding
at
me
out
of
one
of
the
once
lonely
windows
with
his
dear
chubby
face
backed
up
by
trottle
waistcoat
as
he
lifts
my
pet
for
grandma
to
see
many
an
eye
i
see
in
that
house
now
but
it
is
never
in
solitude
never
in
neglect
many
an
eye
i
see
in
that
house
now
that
is
more
and
more
radiant
every
day
with
the
light
of
returning
health
as
my
precious
darling
has
changed
beyond
description
for
the
brighter
and
the
better
so
do
the
not
less
precious
darlings
of
poor
women
change
in
that
house
every
day
in
the
year
for
which
i
humbly
thank
that
gracious
being
whom
the
restorer
of
the
widow
son
and
of
the
ruler
daughter
instructed
all
mankind
to
call
their
father
