the
reconciliation
decoration
the
original
story
is
to
be
found
in
the
curious
volume
entitled
there
was
a
young
samurai
of
kyôto
who
had
been
reduced
to
poverty
by
the
ruin
of
his
lord
and
found
himself
obliged
to
leave
his
home
and
to
take
service
with
the
governor
of
a
distant
province
before
quitting
the
capital
this
samurai
divorced
his
wife
a
good
and
beautiful
woman
under
the
belief
that
he
could
better
obtain
promotion
by
another
alliance
he
then
married
the
daughter
of
a
family
of
some
distinction
and
took
her
with
him
to
the
district
whither
he
had
been
called
but
it
was
in
the
time
of
the
thoughtlessness
of
youth
and
the
sharp
experience
of
want
that
the
samurai
could
not
understand
the
worth
of
the
affection
so
lightly
cast
away
his
second
marriage
did
not
prove
a
happy
one
the
character
of
his
new
wife
was
hard
and
selfish
and
he
soon
found
every
cause
to
think
with
regret
of
kyôto
days
then
he
discovered
that
he
still
loved
his
first
wife
loved
her
more
than
he
could
ever
love
the
second
and
he
began
to
feel
how
unjust
and
how
thankless
he
had
been
gradually
his
repentance
deepened
into
a
remorse
that
left
him
no
peace
of
mind
memories
of
the
woman
he
had
wronged
her
gentle
speech
her
smiles
her
dainty
pretty
ways
her
faultless
patience
continually
haunted
him
sometimes
in
dreams
he
saw
her
at
her
loom
weaving
as
when
she
toiled
night
and
day
to
help
him
during
the
years
of
their
distress
more
often
he
saw
her
kneeling
alone
in
the
desolate
little
room
where
he
had
left
her
veiling
her
tears
with
her
poor
worn
sleeve
even
in
the
hours
of
official
duty
his
thoughts
would
wander
back
to
her
then
he
would
ask
himself
how
she
was
living
what
she
was
doing
something
in
his
heart
assured
him
that
she
could
not
accept
another
husband
and
that
she
never
would
refuse
to
pardon
him
and
he
secretly
resolved
to
seek
her
out
as
soon
as
he
could
return
to
kyôto
then
to
beg
her
forgiveness
to
take
her
back
to
do
everything
that
a
man
could
do
to
make
atonement
but
the
years
went
by
at
last
the
governor
official
term
expired
and
the
samurai
was
free
now
i
will
go
back
to
my
dear
one
he
vowed
to
himself
ah
what
a
cruelty
what
a
folly
to
have
divorced
her
he
sent
his
second
wife
to
her
own
people
she
had
given
him
no
children
and
hurrying
to
kyôto
he
went
at
once
to
seek
his
former
companion
not
allowing
himself
even
the
time
to
change
his
when
he
reached
the
street
where
she
used
to
live
it
was
late
in
the
night
the
night
of
the
tenth
day
of
the
ninth
month
and
the
city
was
silent
as
a
cemetery
but
a
bright
moon
made
everything
visible
and
he
found
the
house
without
difficulty
it
had
a
deserted
look
tall
weeds
were
growing
on
the
roof
he
knocked
at
the
and
no
one
answered
then
finding
that
the
doors
had
not
been
fastened
from
within
he
pushed
them
open
and
entered
the
front
room
was
matless
and
empty
a
chilly
wind
was
blowing
through
crevices
in
the
planking
and
the
moon
shone
through
a
ragged
break
in
the
wall
of
the
alcove
other
rooms
presented
a
like
forlorn
condition
the
house
to
all
seeming
was
unoccupied
nevertheless
the
samurai
determined
to
visit
one
other
apartment
at
the
further
end
of
the
dwelling
a
very
small
room
that
had
been
his
wife
favorite
approaching
the
that
closed
it
he
was
startled
to
perceive
a
glow
within
he
pushed
the
screen
aside
and
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
for
he
saw
her
there
sewing
by
the
light
of
a
her
eyes
at
the
same
instant
met
his
own
and
with
a
happy
smile
she
greeted
him
asking
only
when
did
you
come
back
to
kyôto
how
did
you
find
your
way
here
to
me
through
all
those
black
rooms
the
years
had
not
changed
her
still
she
seemed
as
fair
and
young
as
in
his
fondest
memory
of
her
but
sweeter
than
any
memory
there
came
to
him
the
music
of
her
voice
with
its
trembling
of
pleased
wonder
then
joyfully
he
took
his
place
beside
her
and
told
her
all
how
deeply
he
repented
his
selfishness
how
wretched
he
had
been
without
her
how
constantly
he
had
regretted
her
how
long
he
had
hoped
and
planned
to
make
amends
caressing
her
the
while
and
asking
her
forgiveness
over
and
over
again
she
answered
him
with
loving
gentleness
according
to
his
heart
desire
entreating
him
to
cease
all
it
was
wrong
she
said
that
he
should
have
allowed
himself
to
suffer
on
her
account
she
had
always
felt
that
she
was
not
worthy
to
be
his
wife
she
knew
that
he
had
separated
from
her
notwithstanding
only
because
of
poverty
and
while
he
lived
with
her
he
had
always
been
kind
and
she
had
never
ceased
to
pray
for
his
happiness
but
even
if
there
had
been
a
reason
for
speaking
of
amends
this
honorable
visit
would
be
ample
amends
what
greater
happiness
than
thus
to
see
him
again
though
it
were
only
for
a
moment
only
for
a
moment
he
answered
with
a
glad
laugh
say
rather
for
the
time
of
seven
existences
my
loved
one
unless
you
forbid
i
am
coming
back
to
live
with
you
always
always
always
nothing
shall
ever
separate
us
again
now
i
have
means
and
friends
we
need
not
fear
poverty
my
goods
will
be
brought
here
and
my
servants
will
come
to
wait
upon
you
and
we
shall
make
this
house
beautiful
he
added
apologetically
i
came
thus
late
without
even
changing
my
dress
only
because
of
the
longing
i
had
to
see
you
and
to
tell
you
this
she
seemed
greatly
pleased
by
these
words
and
in
her
turn
she
told
him
about
all
that
had
happened
in
kyôto
since
the
time
of
his
departure
excepting
her
own
sorrows
of
which
she
sweetly
refused
to
speak
they
chatted
far
into
the
night
then
she
conducted
him
to
a
warmer
room
facing
south
a
room
that
had
been
their
bridal
chamber
in
former
time
have
you
no
one
in
the
house
to
help
you
he
asked
as
she
began
to
prepare
the
couch
for
him
no
she
answered
laughing
cheerfully
i
could
not
afford
a
servant
so
i
have
been
living
all
alone
you
will
have
plenty
of
servants
he
said
good
servants
and
everything
else
that
you
need
they
lay
down
to
rest
not
to
sleep
they
had
too
much
to
tell
each
other
and
they
talked
of
the
past
and
the
present
and
the
future
until
the
dawn
was
grey
then
involuntarily
the
samurai
closed
his
eyes
and
slept
when
he
awoke
the
daylight
was
streaming
through
the
chinks
of
the
and
he
found
himself
to
his
utter
amazement
lying
upon
the
naked
boards
of
a
mouldering
floor
had
he
only
dreamed
a
dream
no
she
was
there
she
slept
he
bent
above
her
and
looked
and
shrieked
for
the
sleeper
had
no
face
before
him
wrapped
in
its
only
lay
the
corpse
of
a
woman
a
corpse
so
wasted
that
little
remained
save
the
bones
and
the
long
black
tangled
hair
slowly
as
he
stood
shuddering
and
sickening
in
the
sun
the
icy
horror
yielded
to
a
despair
so
intolerable
a
pain
so
atrocious
that
he
clutched
at
the
mocking
shadow
of
a
doubt
feigning
ignorance
of
the
neighborhood
he
ventured
to
ask
his
way
to
the
house
in
which
his
wife
had
lived
there
is
no
one
in
that
house
said
the
person
questioned
it
used
to
belong
to
the
wife
of
a
samurai
who
left
the
city
several
years
ago
he
divorced
her
in
order
to
marry
another
woman
before
he
went
away
and
she
fretted
a
great
deal
and
so
became
sick
she
had
no
relatives
in
kyôto
and
nobody
to
care
for
her
and
she
died
in
the
autumn
of
the
same
year
on
the
tenth
day
of
the
ninth
month
a
legend
of
decoration
from
the
old
there
was
once
a
very
pious
and
learned
priest
called
shôku
shônin
who
lived
in
the
province
of
harima
for
many
years
he
meditated
daily
upon
the
chapter
of
the
bodhisattva
samantabhadra
in
the
sûtra
of
the
lotos
of
the
good
law
and
he
used
to
pray
every
morning
and
evening
that
he
might
at
some
time
be
permitted
to
behold
as
a
living
presence
and
in
the
form
described
in
the
holy
text
the
priest
desire
was
probably
inspired
by
the
promises
recorded
in
the
chapter
entitled
the
encouragement
of
samantabhadra
see
kern
translation
of
the
saddharma
pundarîka
in
the
books
of
the
pp
then
the
bodhisattva
mahâsattva
samantabhadra
said
to
the
lord
a
preacher
who
applies
himself
to
this
dharmaparyâya
shall
take
a
walk
then
o
lord
will
i
mount
a
white
elephant
with
six
tusks
and
betake
myself
to
the
place
where
that
preacher
is
walking
in
order
to
protect
this
dharmaparyâya
and
when
that
preacher
applying
himself
to
this
dharmaparyâya
forgets
be
it
but
a
single
word
or
syllable
then
will
i
mount
the
white
elephant
with
six
tusks
and
show
my
face
to
that
preacher
and
repeat
this
entire
dharmaparyâya
but
these
promises
refer
to
the
end
of
time
one
evening
while
he
was
reciting
the
sûtra
drowsiness
overcame
him
and
he
fell
asleep
leaning
upon
his
then
he
dreamed
and
in
his
dream
a
voice
told
him
that
in
order
to
see
he
must
go
to
the
house
of
a
certain
courtesan
known
as
the
who
lived
in
the
town
of
kanzaki
immediately
upon
awakening
he
resolved
to
go
to
kanzaki
and
making
all
possible
haste
he
reached
the
town
by
the
evening
of
the
next
day
the
is
a
kind
of
padded
or
upon
which
the
priest
leans
one
arm
while
reading
the
use
of
such
an
is
not
confined
however
to
the
buddhist
clergy
a
yujô
in
old
days
was
a
as
well
as
a
courtesan
the
term
in
this
case
would
mean
simply
the
first
or
best
of
yujô
when
he
entered
the
house
of
the
he
found
many
persons
already
there
assembled
mostly
young
men
of
the
capital
who
had
been
attracted
to
kanzaki
by
the
fame
of
the
woman
beauty
they
were
feasting
and
drinking
and
the
was
playing
a
small
which
she
used
very
skilfully
and
singing
a
song
the
song
which
she
sang
was
an
old
japanese
song
about
a
famous
shrine
in
the
town
of
murozumi
and
the
words
were
these
the
sacred
of
murozumi
in
suwô
even
though
no
wind
be
blowing
the
surface
of
the
water
is
always
or
is
the
name
especially
given
to
the
or
of
stone
or
bronze
placed
before
shintô
shrines
in
order
that
the
worshipper
may
purify
his
lips
and
hands
before
making
prayer
buddhist
tanks
are
not
so
named
the
sweetness
of
the
voice
filled
everybody
with
surprise
and
delight
as
the
priest
who
had
taken
a
place
apart
listened
and
wondered
the
girl
suddenly
fixed
her
eyes
upon
him
and
in
the
same
instant
he
saw
her
form
change
into
the
form
of
emitting
from
her
brow
a
beam
of
light
that
seemed
to
pierce
beyond
the
limits
of
the
universe
and
riding
a
elephant
with
six
tusks
and
still
she
sang
but
the
song
also
was
now
transformed
and
the
words
came
thus
to
the
ears
of
the
priest
the
vast
sea
of
cessation
though
the
winds
of
the
six
desires
and
of
the
five
corruptions
never
blow
yet
the
surface
of
that
deep
is
always
covered
with
the
billowings
of
attainment
to
the
dazzled
by
the
divine
ray
the
priest
closed
his
eyes
but
through
their
lids
he
still
distinctly
saw
the
vision
when
he
opened
them
again
it
was
gone
he
saw
only
the
girl
with
her
and
heard
only
the
song
about
the
water
of
murozumi
but
he
found
that
as
often
as
he
shut
his
eyes
he
could
see
on
the
elephant
and
could
hear
the
mystic
song
of
the
sea
of
cessation
the
other
persons
present
saw
only
the
they
had
not
beheld
the
manifestation
then
the
singer
suddenly
disappeared
from
the
none
could
say
when
or
how
from
that
moment
the
revelry
ceased
and
gloom
took
the
place
of
joy
after
having
waited
and
sought
for
the
girl
to
no
purpose
the
company
dispersed
in
great
sorrow
last
of
all
the
priest
departed
bewildered
by
the
emotions
of
the
evening
but
scarcely
had
he
passed
beyond
the
gate
when
the
appeared
before
him
and
said
friend
do
not
speak
yet
to
any
one
of
what
you
have
seen
this
night
and
with
these
words
she
vanished
away
leaving
the
air
filled
with
a
delicious
fragrance
the
monk
by
whom
the
foregoing
legend
was
recorded
comments
upon
it
thus
the
condition
of
a
is
low
and
miserable
since
she
is
condemned
to
serve
the
lusts
of
men
who
therefore
could
imagine
that
such
a
woman
might
be
the
or
incarnation
of
a
bodhisattva
but
we
must
remember
that
the
buddhas
and
the
bodhisattvas
may
appear
in
this
world
in
countless
different
forms
choosing
for
the
purpose
of
their
divine
compassion
even
the
most
humble
or
contemptible
shapes
when
such
shapes
can
serve
them
to
lead
men
into
the
true
path
and
to
save
them
from
the
perils
of
illusion
the
decoration
related
in
the
says
the
old
japanese
author
rosui
in
chinese
and
in
japanese
books
there
are
related
many
stories
both
of
ancient
and
of
modern
times
about
pictures
that
were
so
beautiful
as
to
exercise
a
magical
influence
upon
the
beholder
and
concerning
such
beautiful
pictures
whether
pictures
of
flowers
or
of
birds
or
of
people
painted
by
famous
artists
it
is
further
told
that
the
shapes
of
the
creatures
or
the
persons
therein
depicted
would
separate
themselves
from
the
paper
or
the
silk
upon
which
they
had
been
painted
and
would
perform
various
acts
so
that
they
became
by
their
own
will
really
alive
we
shall
not
now
repeat
any
of
the
stories
of
this
class
which
have
been
known
to
everybody
from
ancient
times
but
even
in
modern
times
the
fame
of
the
pictures
painted
by
hishigawa
kichibei
portraits
has
become
widespread
in
the
land
he
died
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
kyôhô
the
painter
to
whom
he
refers
better
known
to
collectors
as
hishigawa
kichibei
moronobu
flourished
during
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
beginning
his
career
as
a
apprentice
he
won
his
reputation
as
an
artist
about
when
he
may
be
said
to
have
founded
the
school
of
illustration
hishigawa
was
especially
a
delineator
of
what
are
called
elegant
manners
the
aspects
of
life
among
the
upper
classes
of
society
he
then
proceeds
to
relate
the
following
story
about
one
of
the
portraits
there
was
a
young
scholar
of
kyôto
whose
name
was
tokkei
he
used
to
live
in
the
street
called
muromachi
one
evening
while
on
his
way
home
after
a
visit
his
attention
was
attracted
by
an
old
screen
exposed
for
sale
before
the
shop
of
a
dealer
in
goods
it
was
only
a
screen
but
there
was
painted
upon
it
the
figure
of
a
girl
which
caught
the
young
fancy
the
price
asked
was
very
small
tokkei
bought
the
screen
and
took
it
home
with
him
when
he
looked
again
at
the
screen
in
the
solitude
of
his
own
room
the
picture
seemed
to
him
much
more
beautiful
than
before
apparently
it
was
a
real
likeness
the
portrait
of
a
girl
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
old
and
every
little
detail
in
the
painting
of
the
hair
eyes
eyelashes
mouth
had
been
executed
with
a
delicacy
and
a
truth
beyond
praise
the
seemed
like
a
courting
favor
the
lips
were
like
the
smile
of
a
red
flower
the
whole
young
face
was
inexpressibly
sweet
if
the
real
girl
so
portrayed
had
been
equally
lovely
no
man
could
have
looked
upon
her
without
losing
his
heart
and
tokkei
believed
that
she
must
have
been
thus
lovely
for
the
figure
seemed
alive
ready
to
reply
to
anybody
who
might
speak
to
it
also
written
the
exterior
canthus
of
the
eye
the
japanese
like
the
old
greek
and
the
old
arabian
poets
have
many
curious
dainty
words
and
similes
to
express
particular
beauties
of
the
hair
eyes
eyelids
lips
fingers
etc
gradually
as
he
continued
to
gaze
at
the
picture
he
felt
himself
bewitched
by
the
charm
of
it
can
there
really
have
been
in
this
world
he
murmured
to
himself
so
delicious
a
creature
how
gladly
would
i
give
my
life
nay
a
thousand
years
of
life
to
hold
her
in
my
arms
even
for
a
moment
the
japanese
author
says
for
a
few
seconds
in
short
he
became
enamoured
of
the
picture
so
much
enamoured
of
it
as
to
feel
that
he
never
could
love
any
woman
except
the
person
whom
it
represented
yet
that
person
if
still
alive
could
no
longer
resemble
the
painting
perhaps
she
had
been
buried
long
before
he
was
born
day
by
day
nevertheless
this
hopeless
passion
grew
upon
him
he
could
not
eat
he
could
not
sleep
neither
could
he
occupy
his
mind
with
those
studies
which
had
formerly
delighted
him
he
would
sit
for
hours
before
the
picture
talking
to
it
neglecting
or
forgetting
everything
else
and
at
last
he
fell
sick
so
sick
that
he
believed
himself
going
to
die
now
among
the
friends
of
tokkei
there
was
one
venerable
scholar
who
knew
many
strange
things
about
old
pictures
and
about
young
hearts
this
aged
scholar
hearing
of
tokkei
illness
came
to
visit
him
and
saw
the
screen
and
understood
what
had
happened
then
tokkei
being
questioned
confessed
everything
to
his
friend
and
declared
if
i
can
not
find
such
a
woman
i
shall
die
the
old
man
said
that
picture
was
painted
by
hishigawa
kichibei
painted
from
life
the
person
whom
it
represented
is
not
now
in
the
world
but
it
is
said
that
hishigawa
kichibei
painted
her
mind
as
well
as
her
form
and
that
her
spirit
lives
in
the
picture
so
i
think
that
you
can
win
her
tokkei
half
rose
from
his
bed
and
stared
eagerly
at
the
speaker
you
must
give
her
a
name
the
old
man
continued
and
you
must
sit
before
her
picture
every
day
and
keep
your
thoughts
constantly
fixed
upon
her
and
call
her
gently
by
the
name
which
you
have
given
her
she
answers
answers
me
exclaimed
the
lover
in
breathless
amazement
oh
yes
the
adviser
responded
she
will
certainly
answer
you
but
you
must
be
ready
when
she
answers
you
to
present
her
with
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
i
will
give
her
my
life
cried
tokkei
no
said
the
old
man
you
will
present
her
with
a
cup
of
wine
that
has
been
bought
at
one
hundred
different
then
she
will
come
out
of
the
screen
to
accept
the
wine
after
that
probably
she
herself
will
tell
you
what
to
do
with
these
words
the
old
man
went
away
his
advice
aroused
tokkei
from
despair
at
once
he
seated
himself
before
the
picture
and
called
it
by
the
name
of
a
girl
what
name
the
japanese
narrator
has
forgotten
to
tell
us
over
and
over
again
very
tenderly
that
day
it
made
no
answer
nor
the
next
day
nor
the
next
but
tokkei
did
not
lose
faith
or
patience
and
after
many
days
it
suddenly
one
evening
answered
to
its
name
yes
then
quickly
quickly
some
of
the
wine
from
a
hundred
different
was
poured
out
and
reverentially
presented
in
a
little
cup
and
the
girl
stepped
from
the
screen
and
walked
upon
the
matting
of
the
room
and
knelt
to
take
the
cup
from
tokkei
hand
asking
with
a
delicious
smile
how
could
you
love
me
so
much
says
the
japanese
narrator
she
was
much
more
beautiful
than
the
picture
beautiful
to
the
tips
of
her
beautiful
also
in
heart
and
temper
lovelier
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
what
answer
tokkei
made
to
her
question
is
not
recorded
it
will
have
to
be
imagined
but
will
you
not
soon
get
tired
of
me
she
asked
never
while
i
live
he
protested
and
after
she
persisted
for
the
japanese
bride
is
not
satisfied
with
love
for
one
only
let
us
pledge
ourselves
to
each
other
he
entreated
for
the
time
of
seven
existences
if
you
are
ever
unkind
to
me
she
said
i
will
go
back
to
the
screen
they
pledged
each
other
i
suppose
that
tokkei
was
a
good
boy
for
his
bride
never
returned
to
the
screen
the
space
that
she
had
occupied
upon
it
remained
a
blank
exclaims
the
japanese
author
how
very
seldom
do
such
things
happen
in
this
world
the
decoration
from
the
the
body
was
cold
as
ice
the
heart
had
long
ceased
to
beat
yet
there
were
no
other
signs
of
death
nobody
even
spoke
of
burying
the
woman
she
had
died
of
grief
and
anger
at
having
been
divorced
it
would
have
been
useless
to
bury
her
because
the
last
undying
wish
of
a
dying
person
for
vengeance
can
burst
asunder
any
tomb
and
rift
the
heaviest
graveyard
stone
people
who
lived
near
the
house
in
which
she
was
lying
fled
from
their
homes
they
knew
that
she
was
only
for
the
return
of
the
man
who
had
divorced
at
the
time
of
her
death
he
was
on
a
journey
when
he
came
back
and
was
told
what
had
happened
terror
seized
him
if
i
can
find
no
help
before
dark
he
thought
to
himself
she
will
tear
me
to
pieces
it
was
yet
only
the
hour
of
the
dragon
but
he
knew
that
he
had
no
time
to
lose
no
or
the
hour
of
the
dragon
by
old
japanese
time
began
at
about
eight
in
the
morning
he
went
at
once
to
an
and
begged
for
succor
the
knew
the
story
of
the
dead
woman
and
he
had
seen
the
body
he
said
to
the
supplicant
a
very
great
danger
threatens
you
i
will
try
to
save
you
but
you
must
promise
to
do
whatever
i
shall
tell
you
to
do
there
is
only
one
way
by
which
you
can
be
saved
it
is
a
fearful
way
but
unless
you
find
the
courage
to
attempt
it
she
will
tear
you
limb
from
limb
if
you
can
be
brave
come
to
me
again
in
the
evening
before
sunset
the
man
shuddered
but
he
promised
to
do
whatever
should
be
required
of
him
a
professor
or
master
of
the
science
of
the
old
chinese
based
upon
the
theory
of
a
male
and
a
female
principle
pervading
the
universe
at
sunset
the
went
with
him
to
the
house
where
the
body
was
lying
the
pushed
open
the
and
told
his
client
to
enter
it
was
rapidly
growing
dark
i
dare
not
gasped
the
man
quaking
from
head
to
foot
i
dare
not
even
look
at
her
you
will
have
to
do
much
more
than
look
at
her
declared
the
and
you
promised
to
obey
go
in
he
forced
the
trembler
into
the
house
and
led
him
to
the
side
of
the
corpse
the
dead
woman
was
lying
on
her
face
now
you
must
get
astride
upon
her
said
the
and
sit
firmly
on
her
back
as
if
you
were
riding
a
horse
come
you
must
do
it
the
man
shivered
so
that
the
had
to
support
him
shivered
horribly
but
he
obeyed
now
take
her
hair
in
your
hands
commanded
the
half
in
the
right
hand
half
in
the
left
so
you
must
grip
it
like
a
bridle
twist
your
hands
in
it
both
hands
tightly
that
is
the
way
listen
to
me
you
must
stay
like
that
till
morning
you
will
have
reason
to
be
afraid
in
the
night
plenty
of
reason
but
whatever
may
happen
never
let
go
of
her
hair
if
you
let
go
even
for
one
second
she
will
tear
you
into
gobbets
the
then
whispered
some
mysterious
words
into
the
ear
of
the
body
and
said
to
its
rider
now
for
my
own
sake
i
must
leave
you
alone
with
her
remain
as
you
are
above
all
things
remember
that
you
must
not
let
go
of
her
hair
and
he
went
away
closing
the
doors
behind
him
hour
after
hour
the
man
sat
upon
the
corpse
in
black
fear
and
the
hush
of
the
night
deepened
and
deepened
about
him
till
he
screamed
to
break
it
instantly
the
body
sprang
beneath
him
as
to
cast
him
off
and
the
dead
woman
cried
out
loudly
oh
how
heavy
it
is
yet
i
shall
bring
that
fellow
here
now
then
tall
she
rose
and
leaped
to
the
doors
and
flung
them
open
and
rushed
into
the
night
always
bearing
the
weight
of
the
man
but
he
shutting
his
eyes
kept
his
hands
twisted
in
her
long
hair
tightly
tightly
though
fearing
with
such
a
fear
that
he
could
not
even
moan
how
far
she
went
he
never
knew
he
saw
nothing
he
heard
only
the
sound
of
her
naked
feet
in
the
dark
and
the
hiss
of
her
breathing
as
she
ran
at
last
she
turned
and
ran
back
into
the
house
and
lay
down
upon
the
floor
exactly
as
at
first
under
the
man
she
panted
and
moaned
till
the
cocks
began
to
crow
thereafter
she
lay
still
but
the
man
with
chattering
teeth
sat
upon
her
until
the
came
at
sunrise
so
you
did
not
let
go
of
her
hair
observed
the
greatly
pleased
that
is
well
now
you
can
stand
up
he
whispered
again
into
the
ear
of
the
corpse
and
then
said
to
the
man
you
must
have
passed
a
fearful
night
but
nothing
else
could
have
saved
you
hereafter
you
may
feel
secure
from
her
vengeance
decoration
the
conclusion
of
this
story
i
do
not
think
to
be
morally
satisfying
it
is
not
recorded
that
the
became
insane
or
that
his
hair
turned
white
we
are
told
only
that
he
worshipped
the
with
tears
of
gratitude
a
note
appended
to
the
recital
is
equally
disappointing
it
is
reported
the
japanese
author
says
that
a
grandchild
of
the
man
rode
the
still
survives
and
that
a
grandson
of
the
is
at
this
very
time
living
in
a
village
called
pronounced
this
does
not
appear
in
any
japanese
directory
of
but
the
names
of
many
towns
and
villages
have
been
changed
since
the
foregoing
story
was
written
the
sympathy
of
benten
decoration
the
original
story
is
in
the
in
kyôto
there
is
a
famous
temple
called
amadera
sadazumi
shinnô
the
fifth
son
of
the
emperor
seiwa
passed
the
greater
part
of
his
life
there
as
a
priest
and
the
graves
of
many
celebrated
persons
are
to
be
seen
in
the
but
the
present
edifice
is
not
the
ancient
amadera
the
original
temple
after
the
lapse
of
ten
centuries
fell
into
such
decay
that
it
had
to
be
entirely
rebuilt
in
the
fourteenth
year
of
genroku
a
great
festival
was
held
to
celebrate
the
rebuilding
of
the
amadera
and
among
the
thousands
of
persons
who
attended
that
festival
there
was
a
young
scholar
and
poet
named
hanagaki
baishû
he
wandered
about
the
grounds
and
gardens
delighted
by
all
that
he
saw
until
he
reached
the
place
of
a
spring
at
which
he
had
often
drunk
in
former
times
he
was
then
surprised
to
find
that
the
soil
about
the
spring
had
been
dug
away
so
as
to
form
a
square
pond
and
that
at
one
corner
of
this
pond
there
had
been
set
up
a
wooden
tablet
bearing
the
words
he
also
saw
that
a
small
but
very
handsome
temple
of
the
goddess
benten
had
been
erected
beside
the
pond
while
he
was
looking
at
this
new
temple
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
blew
to
his
feet
a
on
which
the
following
poem
had
been
written
shirushi
aréto
iwai
zo
somuru
tama
hôki
toruté
bakari
no
chigiri
narétomo
the
word
birth
should
here
be
understood
in
its
mystical
buddhist
meaning
of
new
life
or
rebirth
rather
than
in
the
western
signification
of
birth
is
the
name
given
to
the
long
strips
or
ribbons
of
paper
usually
colored
upon
which
poems
are
written
perpendicularly
poems
written
upon
are
suspended
to
trees
in
flower
to
to
any
beautiful
object
in
which
the
poet
has
found
an
inspiration
this
poem
a
poem
on
first
love
composed
by
the
famous
shunrei
kyô
was
not
unfamiliar
to
him
but
it
had
been
written
upon
the
by
a
female
hand
and
so
exquisitely
that
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
something
in
the
form
of
the
characters
an
indefinite
grace
suggested
that
period
of
youth
between
childhood
and
womanhood
and
the
pure
rich
color
of
the
ink
seemed
to
bespeak
the
purity
and
goodness
of
the
writer
heart
it
is
difficult
for
the
inexperienced
european
eye
to
distinguish
in
chinese
or
japanese
writing
those
characteristics
implied
by
our
term
hand
in
the
sense
of
individual
style
but
the
japanese
scholar
never
forgets
the
peculiarities
of
a
handwriting
once
seen
and
he
can
even
guess
at
the
approximate
age
of
the
writer
chinese
and
japanese
authors
claim
that
the
color
quality
of
the
ink
used
tells
something
of
the
character
of
the
writer
as
every
person
grounds
or
prepares
his
or
her
own
ink
the
deeper
and
clearer
black
would
at
least
indicate
something
of
personal
carefulness
and
of
the
sense
of
beauty
baishû
carefully
folded
up
the
and
took
it
home
with
him
when
he
looked
at
it
again
the
writing
appeared
to
him
even
more
wonderful
than
at
first
his
knowledge
in
caligraphy
assured
him
only
that
the
poem
had
been
written
by
some
girl
who
was
very
young
very
intelligent
and
probably
very
but
this
assurance
sufficed
to
shape
within
his
mind
the
image
of
a
very
charming
person
and
he
soon
found
himself
in
love
with
the
unknown
then
his
first
resolve
was
to
seek
out
the
writer
of
the
verses
and
if
possible
make
her
his
wife
yet
how
was
he
to
find
her
who
was
she
where
did
she
live
certainly
he
could
hope
to
find
her
only
through
the
favor
of
the
gods
but
presently
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
gods
might
be
very
willing
to
lend
their
aid
the
had
come
to
him
while
he
was
standing
in
front
of
the
temple
of
and
it
was
to
this
divinity
in
particular
that
lovers
were
wont
to
pray
for
happy
union
this
reflection
impelled
him
to
beseech
the
goddess
for
assistance
he
went
at
once
to
the
temple
of
in
the
grounds
of
the
amadera
and
there
with
all
the
fervor
of
his
heart
he
made
his
petition
o
goddess
pity
me
help
me
to
find
where
the
young
person
lives
who
wrote
the
vouchsafe
me
but
one
chance
to
meet
her
even
if
only
for
a
moment
and
after
having
made
this
prayer
he
began
to
perform
a
seven
days
religious
service
in
honor
of
the
goddess
vowing
at
the
same
time
to
pass
the
seventh
night
in
ceaseless
worship
before
her
shrine
there
are
many
kinds
of
religious
exercises
called
the
performer
of
a
pledges
himself
to
pray
at
a
certain
temple
every
day
for
seven
days
in
succession
now
on
the
seventh
night
the
night
of
his
vigil
during
the
hour
when
the
silence
is
most
deep
he
heard
at
the
main
gateway
of
the
a
voice
calling
for
admittance
another
voice
from
within
answered
the
gate
was
opened
and
baishû
saw
an
old
man
of
majestic
appearance
approaching
with
slow
steps
this
venerable
person
was
clad
in
robes
of
ceremony
and
he
wore
upon
his
head
a
black
cap
of
the
form
indicating
high
rank
reaching
the
little
temple
of
benten
he
knelt
down
in
front
of
it
as
if
respectfully
awaiting
some
order
then
the
outer
door
of
the
temple
was
opened
the
hanging
curtain
of
bamboo
behind
it
concealing
the
inner
sanctuary
was
rolled
up
and
a
came
forward
a
beautiful
boy
with
long
hair
tied
back
in
the
ancient
manner
he
stood
at
the
threshold
and
said
to
the
old
man
in
a
clear
loud
voice
the
term
usually
means
the
page
of
a
noble
household
especially
an
imperial
page
the
who
appears
in
this
story
is
of
course
a
supernatural
being
the
of
the
goddess
and
her
mouthpiece
there
is
a
person
here
who
has
been
praying
for
a
not
suitable
to
his
present
condition
and
otherwise
difficult
to
bring
about
but
as
the
young
man
is
worthy
of
our
pity
you
have
been
called
to
see
whether
something
can
be
done
for
him
if
there
should
prove
to
be
any
relation
between
the
parties
from
the
period
of
a
former
birth
you
will
introduce
them
to
each
other
on
receiving
this
command
the
old
man
bowed
respectfully
to
the
then
rising
he
drew
from
the
pocket
of
his
long
left
sleeve
a
crimson
cord
one
end
of
this
cord
he
passed
round
baishû
body
as
if
to
bind
him
with
it
the
other
end
he
put
into
the
flame
of
one
of
the
and
while
the
cord
was
there
burning
he
waved
his
hand
three
times
as
if
to
summon
somebody
out
of
the
dark
immediately
in
the
direction
of
the
amadera
a
sound
of
coming
steps
was
heard
and
in
another
moment
a
girl
appeared
a
charming
girl
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
old
she
approached
gracefully
but
very
shyly
hiding
the
lower
part
of
her
face
with
a
fan
and
she
knelt
down
beside
baishû
the
then
said
to
baishû
recently
you
have
been
suffering
much
and
this
desperate
love
of
yours
has
even
impaired
your
health
we
could
not
allow
you
to
remain
in
so
unhappy
a
condition
and
we
therefore
summoned
the
to
make
you
acquainted
with
the
writer
of
that
she
is
now
beside
you
this
is
a
poetical
appellation
for
the
god
of
marriage
more
usually
known
as
throughout
this
story
there
is
an
interesting
mingling
of
shintô
and
buddhist
ideas
with
these
words
the
retired
behind
the
bamboo
curtain
then
the
old
man
went
away
as
he
had
come
and
the
young
girl
followed
him
simultaneously
baishû
heard
the
great
bell
of
the
amadera
sounding
the
hour
of
dawn
he
prostrated
himself
in
thanksgiving
before
the
shrine
of
and
proceeded
homeward
feeling
as
if
awakened
from
some
delightful
dream
happy
at
having
seen
the
charming
person
whom
he
had
so
fervently
prayed
to
meet
unhappy
also
because
of
the
fear
that
he
might
never
meet
her
again
but
scarcely
had
he
passed
from
the
gateway
into
the
street
when
he
saw
a
young
girl
walking
alone
in
the
same
direction
that
he
was
going
and
even
in
the
dusk
of
the
dawn
he
recognized
her
at
once
as
the
person
to
whom
he
had
been
introduced
before
the
temple
of
benten
as
he
quickened
his
pace
to
overtake
her
she
turned
and
saluted
him
with
a
graceful
bow
then
for
the
first
time
he
ventured
to
speak
to
her
and
she
answered
him
in
a
voice
of
which
the
sweetness
filled
his
heart
with
joy
through
the
yet
silent
streets
they
walked
on
chatting
happily
till
they
found
themselves
before
the
house
where
baishû
lived
there
he
paused
spoke
to
the
girl
of
his
hopes
and
fears
smiling
she
asked
do
you
not
know
that
i
was
sent
for
to
become
your
wife
and
she
entered
with
him
becoming
his
wife
she
delighted
him
beyond
expectation
by
the
charm
of
her
mind
and
heart
moreover
he
found
her
to
be
much
more
accomplished
than
he
had
supposed
besides
being
able
to
write
so
wonderfully
she
could
paint
beautiful
pictures
she
knew
the
art
of
arranging
flowers
the
art
of
embroidery
the
art
of
music
she
could
weave
and
sew
and
she
knew
everything
in
regard
to
the
management
of
a
house
it
was
in
the
early
autumn
that
the
young
people
had
met
and
they
lived
together
in
perfect
accord
until
the
winter
season
began
nothing
during
those
months
occurred
to
disturb
their
peace
baishû
love
for
his
gentle
wife
only
strengthened
with
the
passing
of
time
yet
strangely
enough
he
remained
ignorant
of
her
history
knew
nothing
about
her
family
of
such
matters
she
had
never
spoken
and
as
the
gods
had
given
her
to
him
he
imagined
that
it
would
not
be
proper
to
question
her
but
neither
the
nor
any
one
else
came
as
he
had
feared
to
take
her
away
nobody
even
made
any
inquiries
about
her
and
the
neighbors
for
some
undiscoverable
reason
acted
as
if
totally
unaware
of
her
presence
baishû
wondered
at
all
this
but
stranger
experiences
were
awaiting
him
one
winter
morning
he
happened
to
be
passing
through
a
somewhat
remote
quarter
of
the
city
when
he
heard
himself
loudly
called
by
name
and
saw
a
making
signs
to
him
from
the
gateway
of
a
private
residence
as
baishû
did
not
know
the
man
face
and
did
not
have
a
single
acquaintance
in
that
part
of
kyôto
he
was
more
than
startled
by
so
abrupt
a
summons
but
the
servant
coming
forward
saluted
him
with
the
utmost
respect
and
said
my
master
greatly
desires
the
honor
of
speaking
with
you
deign
to
enter
for
a
moment
after
an
instant
of
hesitation
baishû
allowed
himself
to
be
conducted
to
the
house
a
dignified
and
richly
dressed
person
who
seemed
to
be
the
master
welcomed
him
at
the
entrance
and
led
him
to
the
when
the
courtesies
due
upon
a
first
meeting
had
been
fully
exchanged
the
host
apologized
for
the
informal
manner
of
his
invitation
and
said
it
must
have
seemed
to
you
very
rude
of
us
to
call
you
in
such
a
way
but
perhaps
you
will
pardon
our
impoliteness
when
i
tell
you
that
we
acted
thus
upon
what
i
firmly
believe
to
have
been
an
inspiration
from
the
goddess
benten
now
permit
me
to
explain
i
have
a
daughter
about
sixteen
years
old
who
can
write
rather
well
and
do
other
things
in
the
common
way
she
has
the
ordinary
nature
of
woman
as
we
were
anxious
to
make
her
happy
by
finding
a
good
husband
for
her
we
prayed
the
goddess
benten
to
help
us
and
we
sent
to
every
temple
of
benten
in
the
city
a
written
by
the
girl
some
nights
later
the
goddess
appeared
to
me
in
a
dream
and
said
have
heard
your
prayer
and
have
already
introduced
your
daughter
to
the
person
who
is
to
become
her
husband
during
the
coming
winter
he
will
visit
you
as
i
did
not
understand
this
assurance
that
a
presentation
had
been
made
i
felt
some
doubt
i
thought
that
the
dream
might
have
been
only
a
common
dream
signifying
nothing
but
last
night
again
i
saw
in
a
dream
and
she
said
to
me
the
young
man
of
whom
i
once
spoke
to
you
will
come
to
this
street
then
you
can
call
him
into
your
house
and
ask
him
to
become
the
husband
of
your
daughter
he
is
a
good
young
man
and
later
in
life
he
will
obtain
a
much
higher
rank
than
he
now
holds
then
told
me
your
name
your
age
your
birthplace
and
described
your
features
and
dress
so
exactly
that
my
servant
found
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
you
by
the
indications
which
i
was
able
to
give
him
as
it
is
the
old
japanese
rule
that
parents
should
speak
depreciatingly
of
their
children
accomplishments
the
phrase
rather
well
in
this
connection
would
mean
for
the
visitor
wonderfully
well
for
the
same
reason
the
expressions
common
way
and
ordinary
nature
as
subsequently
used
would
imply
almost
the
reverse
of
the
literal
meaning
this
explanation
bewildered
baishû
instead
of
reassuring
him
and
his
only
reply
was
a
formal
return
of
thanks
for
the
honor
which
the
master
of
the
house
had
spoken
of
doing
him
but
when
the
host
invited
him
to
another
room
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
him
to
the
young
lady
his
embarrassment
became
extreme
yet
he
could
not
reasonably
decline
the
introduction
he
could
not
bring
himself
under
such
extraordinary
circumstances
to
announce
that
he
already
had
a
wife
a
wife
given
to
him
by
the
goddess
benten
herself
a
wife
from
whom
he
could
not
even
think
of
separating
so
in
silence
and
trepidation
he
followed
his
host
to
the
apartment
indicated
then
what
was
his
amazement
to
discover
when
presented
to
the
daughter
of
the
house
that
she
was
the
very
same
person
whom
he
had
already
taken
to
wife
same
yet
not
the
she
to
whom
he
had
been
introduced
by
the
was
only
the
soul
of
the
beloved
she
to
whom
he
was
now
to
be
wedded
in
her
father
house
was
the
body
benten
had
wrought
this
miracle
for
the
sake
of
her
worshippers
decoration
the
original
story
breaks
off
suddenly
at
this
point
leaving
several
matters
unexplained
the
ending
is
rather
unsatisfactory
one
would
like
to
know
something
about
the
mental
experiences
of
the
real
maiden
during
the
married
life
of
her
phantom
one
would
also
like
to
know
what
became
of
the
phantom
whether
it
continued
to
lead
an
independent
existence
whether
it
waited
patiently
for
the
return
of
its
husband
whether
it
paid
a
visit
to
the
real
bride
and
the
book
says
nothing
about
these
things
but
a
japanese
friend
explains
the
miracle
thus
the
was
really
formed
out
of
the
so
it
is
possible
that
the
real
girl
did
not
know
anything
about
the
meeting
at
the
temple
of
benten
when
she
wrote
those
beautiful
characters
upon
the
something
of
her
spirit
passed
into
them
therefore
it
was
possible
to
evoke
from
the
writing
the
double
of
the
writer
the
gratitude
of
the
samébito
decoration
the
original
of
this
story
may
be
found
in
the
book
called
there
was
a
man
named
tawaraya
tôtarô
who
lived
in
the
province
of
ômi
his
house
was
situated
on
the
shore
of
lake
biwa
not
far
from
the
famous
temple
called
ishiyamadera
he
had
some
property
and
lived
in
comfort
but
at
the
age
of
he
was
still
unmarried
his
greatest
ambition
was
to
marry
a
very
beautiful
woman
and
he
had
not
been
able
to
find
a
girl
to
his
liking
one
day
as
he
was
passing
over
the
long
bridge
of
séta
he
saw
a
strange
being
crouching
close
to
the
parapet
the
body
of
this
being
resembled
the
body
of
a
man
but
was
black
as
ink
its
face
was
like
the
face
of
a
demon
its
eyes
were
green
as
emeralds
and
its
beard
was
like
the
beard
of
a
dragon
tôtarô
was
at
first
very
much
startled
but
the
green
eyes
looked
at
him
so
gently
that
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
ventured
to
question
the
creature
then
it
answered
him
saying
i
am
a
a
of
the
sea
and
until
a
short
time
ago
i
was
in
the
service
of
the
eight
great
as
a
subordinate
officer
in
the
but
because
of
a
small
fault
which
i
committed
i
was
dismissed
from
the
and
also
banished
from
the
sea
since
then
i
have
been
wandering
about
here
unable
to
get
any
food
or
even
a
place
to
lie
down
if
you
can
feel
any
pity
for
me
do
i
beseech
you
help
me
to
find
a
shelter
and
let
me
have
something
to
eat
the
long
bridge
of
séta
famous
in
japanese
legend
is
nearly
eight
hundred
feet
in
length
and
commands
a
beautiful
view
this
bridge
crosses
the
waters
of
the
sétagawa
near
the
junction
of
the
stream
with
lake
biwa
ishiyamadera
one
of
the
most
picturesque
buddhist
temples
in
japan
is
situated
within
a
short
distance
from
the
bridge
literally
a
but
in
this
story
the
is
a
male
the
characters
for
can
also
be
read
which
is
the
usual
reading
in
dictionaries
the
word
is
loosely
rendered
by
merman
or
mermaid
but
as
the
above
description
shows
the
or
of
the
far
east
is
a
conception
having
little
in
common
with
the
western
idea
of
a
merman
or
mermaid
is
also
the
name
given
to
the
whole
of
that
beneath
the
sea
which
figures
in
so
many
japanese
legends
this
petition
was
uttered
in
so
plaintive
a
tone
and
in
so
humble
a
manner
that
tôtarô
heart
was
touched
come
with
me
he
said
there
is
in
my
garden
a
large
and
deep
pond
where
you
may
live
as
long
as
you
wish
and
i
will
give
you
plenty
to
eat
the
followed
tôtarô
home
and
appeared
to
be
much
pleased
with
the
pond
thereafter
for
nearly
half
a
year
this
strange
guest
dwelt
in
the
pond
and
was
every
day
supplied
by
tôtarô
with
such
food
as
like
this
point
of
the
original
narrative
the
is
referred
to
not
as
a
monster
but
as
a
sympathetic
person
of
the
male
now
in
the
seventh
month
of
the
same
year
there
was
a
female
pilgrimage
to
the
great
buddhist
temple
called
miidera
in
the
neighboring
town
of
ôtsu
and
tôtarô
went
to
ôtsu
to
attend
the
festival
among
the
multitude
of
women
and
young
girls
there
assembled
he
observed
a
person
of
extraordinary
beauty
she
seemed
about
sixteen
years
old
her
face
was
fair
and
pure
as
snow
and
the
loveliness
of
her
lips
assured
the
beholder
that
their
every
utterance
would
sound
as
sweet
as
the
voice
of
a
nightingale
singing
upon
a
tôtarô
fell
in
love
with
her
at
sight
when
she
left
the
temple
he
followed
her
at
a
respectful
distance
and
discovered
that
she
and
her
mother
were
staying
for
a
few
days
at
a
certain
house
in
the
neighboring
village
of
séta
by
questioning
some
of
the
village
folk
he
was
able
also
to
learn
that
her
name
was
tamana
that
she
was
unmarried
and
that
her
family
appeared
to
be
unwilling
that
she
should
marry
a
man
of
ordinary
rank
for
they
demanded
as
a
a
casket
containing
ten
thousand
jewels
in
the
original
this
word
has
a
multitude
of
meanings
and
as
here
used
it
is
quite
as
indefinite
as
our
own
terms
jewel
gem
or
precious
stone
indeed
it
is
more
indefinite
for
it
signifies
also
a
bead
of
coral
a
ball
of
crystal
a
polished
stone
attached
to
a
hairpin
etc
later
on
however
i
venture
to
render
it
by
ruby
for
reasons
which
need
no
explanation
tôtarô
returned
home
very
much
dismayed
by
this
information
the
more
that
he
thought
about
the
strange
demanded
by
the
parents
the
more
he
felt
that
he
could
never
expect
to
obtain
her
for
his
wife
even
supposing
that
there
were
as
many
as
ten
thousand
jewels
in
the
whole
country
only
a
great
prince
could
hope
to
procure
them
but
not
even
for
a
single
hour
could
tôtarô
banish
from
his
mind
the
memory
of
that
beautiful
being
it
haunted
him
so
that
he
could
neither
eat
nor
sleep
and
it
seemed
to
become
more
and
more
vivid
as
the
days
went
by
and
at
last
he
became
ill
so
ill
that
he
could
not
lift
his
head
from
the
pillow
then
he
sent
for
a
doctor
the
doctor
after
having
made
a
careful
examination
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
almost
any
kind
of
sickness
he
said
can
be
cured
by
proper
medical
treatment
except
the
sickness
of
love
your
ailment
is
evidently
there
is
no
cure
for
it
in
ancient
times
hakuyo
died
of
that
sickness
and
you
must
prepare
yourself
to
die
as
he
died
so
saying
the
doctor
went
away
without
even
giving
any
medicine
to
tôtarô
about
this
time
the
that
was
living
in
the
heard
of
his
master
sickness
and
came
into
the
house
to
wait
upon
tôtarô
and
he
tended
him
with
the
utmost
affection
both
by
day
and
by
night
but
he
did
not
know
either
the
cause
or
the
serious
nature
of
the
sickness
until
nearly
a
week
later
when
tôtarô
thinking
himself
about
to
die
uttered
these
words
of
farewell
i
suppose
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
caring
for
you
thus
long
because
of
some
relation
that
grew
up
between
us
in
a
former
state
of
existence
but
now
i
am
very
sick
indeed
and
every
day
my
sickness
becomes
worse
and
my
life
is
like
the
morning
dew
which
passes
away
before
the
setting
of
the
sun
for
your
sake
therefore
i
am
troubled
in
mind
your
existence
has
depended
upon
my
care
and
i
fear
that
there
will
be
no
one
to
care
for
you
and
to
feed
you
when
i
am
dead
my
poor
friend
alas
our
hopes
and
our
wishes
are
always
disappointed
in
this
unhappy
world
no
sooner
had
tôtarô
spoken
these
words
than
the
samébito
uttered
a
strange
wild
cry
of
pain
and
began
to
weep
bitterly
and
as
he
wept
great
tears
of
blood
streamed
from
his
green
eyes
and
rolled
down
his
black
cheeks
and
dripped
upon
the
floor
and
falling
they
were
blood
but
having
fallen
they
became
hard
and
bright
and
beautiful
became
jewels
of
inestimable
price
rubies
splendid
as
crimson
fire
for
when
men
of
the
sea
weep
their
tears
become
precious
stones
then
tôtarô
beholding
this
marvel
was
so
amazed
and
overjoyed
that
his
strength
returned
to
him
he
sprang
from
his
bed
and
began
to
pick
up
and
to
count
the
tears
of
the
crying
out
the
while
my
sickness
is
cured
i
shall
live
i
shall
live
therewith
the
greatly
astonished
ceased
to
weep
and
asked
tôtarô
to
explain
this
wonderful
cure
and
tôtarô
told
him
about
the
young
person
seen
at
miidera
and
about
the
extraordinary
demanded
by
her
family
as
i
felt
sure
added
tôtarô
that
i
should
never
be
able
to
get
ten
thousand
jewels
i
supposed
that
my
suit
would
be
hopeless
then
i
became
very
unhappy
and
at
last
fell
sick
but
now
because
of
your
generous
weeping
i
have
many
precious
stones
and
i
think
that
i
shall
be
able
to
marry
that
girl
only
there
are
not
yet
quite
enough
stones
and
i
beg
that
you
will
be
good
enough
to
weep
a
little
more
so
as
to
make
up
the
full
number
required
but
at
this
request
the
samébito
shook
his
head
and
answered
in
a
tone
of
surprise
and
of
reproach
do
you
think
that
i
am
like
a
harlot
able
to
weep
whenever
i
wish
oh
no
harlots
shed
tears
in
order
to
deceive
men
but
creatures
of
the
sea
can
not
weep
without
feeling
real
sorrow
i
wept
for
you
because
of
the
true
grief
that
i
felt
in
my
heart
at
the
thought
that
you
were
going
to
die
but
now
i
can
not
weep
for
you
because
you
have
told
me
that
your
sickness
is
cured
then
what
am
i
to
do
plaintively
asked
tôtarô
unless
i
can
get
ten
thousand
jewels
i
can
not
marry
the
girl
the
samébito
remained
for
a
little
while
silent
as
if
thinking
then
he
said
listen
i
can
not
possibly
weep
any
more
but
let
us
go
together
to
the
long
bridge
of
séta
taking
with
us
some
wine
and
some
fish
we
can
rest
for
a
time
on
the
bridge
and
while
we
are
drinking
the
wine
and
eating
the
fish
i
shall
gaze
in
the
direction
of
the
and
try
by
thinking
of
the
happy
days
that
i
spent
there
to
make
myself
feel
homesick
so
that
i
can
weep
tôtarô
joyfully
assented
next
morning
the
two
taking
plenty
of
wine
and
fish
with
them
went
to
the
séta
bridge
and
rested
there
and
feasted
after
having
drunk
a
great
deal
of
wine
the
samébito
began
to
gaze
in
the
direction
of
the
and
to
think
about
the
past
and
gradually
under
the
softening
influence
of
the
wine
the
memory
of
happier
days
filled
his
heart
with
sorrow
and
the
pain
of
homesickness
came
upon
him
so
that
he
could
weep
profusely
and
the
great
red
tears
that
he
shed
fell
upon
the
bridge
in
a
shower
of
rubies
and
tôtarô
gathered
them
as
they
fell
and
put
them
into
a
casket
and
counted
them
until
he
had
counted
the
full
number
of
ten
thousand
then
he
uttered
a
shout
of
joy
almost
in
the
same
moment
from
far
away
over
the
lake
a
delightful
sound
of
music
was
heard
and
there
appeared
in
the
offing
slowly
rising
from
the
waters
like
some
fabric
of
cloud
a
palace
of
the
color
of
the
setting
sun
at
once
the
samébito
sprang
upon
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
and
looked
and
laughed
for
joy
then
turning
to
tôtarô
he
said
there
must
have
been
a
general
amnesty
proclaimed
in
the
the
kings
are
calling
me
so
now
i
must
bid
you
farewell
i
am
happy
to
have
had
one
chance
of
befriending
you
in
return
for
your
goodness
to
me
with
these
words
he
leaped
from
the
bridge
and
no
man
ever
saw
him
again
but
tôtarô
presented
the
casket
of
red
jewels
to
the
parents
of
tamana
and
so
obtained

the

having
been

consumed
by
crying
there
remains
only
the
shell
of
the
i
a
celebrated
chinese
scholar
known
in
japanese
literature
as
wrote
the
following
quaint
account
of
the
five
virtues
of
the
cicada
the
cicada
has
upon
its
head
certain
figures
or
signs
these
represent
its
written
characters

the
curious
markings
on
the

are

to

characters
which
are

of
souls
it
eats
nothing

drinks

it

this
proves
its
probity
uprightness
honesty
it
does
not
make
for
itself
any
nest
to
live
in
this
proves
its
frugality
thrift
economy
we
might
compare
this
with
the
beautiful
address
of
anacreon
to
the
cicada
written
hundred
years
ago
on
more
than
one
point
the
greek
poet
and
the
chinese
sage
are
in
perfect
accord
deem
thee
happy
o
cicada
because
having
drunk
like
a
king
only
a
little
dew
thou
dost
chirrup
on
the
tops
of
trees
for
all
things
whatsoever
that
thou
seest

fields

thine
and
whatsoever
the
seasons
bring
forth
yet
art
thou
the
friend
of
the
tillers
of
the
land
from
no
one
harmfully
taking
aught
by
mortals
thou
art
held
in
honor
as
the
pleasant
harbinger
of
summer
and
the
muses
love
thee
phoebus
himself
loves
thee
and
has
given
thee
a
shrill
song
and
old
age
does
not
consume
thee
o
thou
gifted
one
free
from
pain
having
flesh
without

thou
art
nearly
equal
to
the
gods
in
this
and
other
citations
from
the
greek
anthology
i
have
depended
upon
translation
and
we
must
certainly
go
back
to
the
old
greek
literature
in
order
to
find
a
poetry
comparable
to
that
of
the
japanese
on
the
subject
of
musical
insects
perhaps
of
greek
verses
on
the
cricket
the
most
beautiful
are
the
lines
of
meleager
cricket
the
soother
of
slumber
weaving
the
thread
of
a
voice
that
causes
love
to
wander
away
there
are
japanese
poems
scarcely
less
delicate
in
sentiment
on
the
chirruping
of
and
meleager
promise
to
reward
the
little
singer
with
gifts
of
fresh
leek
and
with
drops
of
dew

japanese
then
the
poem
attributed
to
anyté
about
the
little
girl
myro
making
a
tomb
for
her
pet
cicada
and
cricket
and
weeping
because
hades
hard
to
be
persuaded
had
taken
her
playthings
away
represents
an
experience
familiar
to
japanese
i
suppose
that
little
myro
how
freshly
her
tears
still
glisten
after
seven
and
twenty
centuries
prepared
that
common
tomb
for
her
pets
much
as
the
little
maid
of
nippon
would
do
putting
a
small
stone
on
top
to
serve
for
a
monument
but
the
wiser
japanese
myro
would
repeat
over
the
grave
a
certain
buddhist
prayer
it
is
especially
in
their
poems
upon
the
cicada
that
we
find
the
old
greeks
confessing
their
love
of
witness
the
lines
in
the
anthology
about
the
tettix
caught
in
a
spider
snare
and
making
lament
in
the
thin
fetters
until
freed
by
the
poet
and
the
verses
by
leonidas
of
tarentum
picturing
the
unpaid
minstrel
to
wayfaring
men
as
sitting
upon
lofty
trees
warmed
with
the
great
heat
of
summer
sipping
the
dew
that
is
like
woman
milk
and
the
dainty
fragment
of
meleager
beginning
vocal
tettix
drunk
with
drops
of
dew
sitting
with
thy
serrated
limbs
upon
the
tops
of
petals
thou
givest
out
the
melody
of
the
lyre
from
thy
dusky
or
take
the
charming
address
of
evenus
to
a
nightingale
attic
maiden
hast
chirping
seized
a
chirping
cicada
and
bearest
it
to
thy
unfledged
young
thou
a
twitterer
the
twitterer
thou
the
winged
the
thou
a
stranger
the
stranger
thou
a
the
wilt
thou
not
quickly
cast
it
from
thee
for
it
is
not
right
it
is
not
just
that
those
engaged
in
song
should
perish
by
the
mouths
of
those
engaged
in
on
the
other
hand
we
find
japanese
poets
much
more
inclined
to
praise
the
voices
of
than
those
of
sémi
there
are
countless
poems
about
sémi
but
very
few
which
commend
their
singing
of
course
the
sémi
are
very
different
from
the
cicadæ
known
to
the
greeks
some
varieties
are
truly
musical
but
the
majority
are
astonishingly
noisy
so
noisy
that
their
stridulation
is
considered
one
of
the
great
afflictions
of
summer
therefore
it
were
vain
to
seek
among
the
myriads
of
japanese
verses
on
sémi
for
anything
comparable
to
the
lines
of
evenus
above
quoted
indeed
the
only
japanese
poem
that
i
could
find
on
the
subject
of
a
cicada
caught
by
a
bird
was
the
following
ana
kanashi
tobi
ni
toraruru
sémi
no
koë
ransetsu
ah
how
piteous
the
cry
of
the
sémi
seized
by
the
kite
or
caught
by
a
boy
the
poet
might
equally
well
have
observed
this
being
a
much
more
frequent
cause
of
the
pitiful
cry
the
lament
of
nicias
for
the
tettix
would
serve
as
the
elegy
of
many
a
sémi
more
shall
i
delight
myself
by
sending
out
a
sound
from
my
wings
because
i
have
fallen
into
the
savage
hand
of
a
boy
who
seized
me
unexpectedly
as
i
was
sitting
under
the
green
here
i
may
remark
that
japanese
children
usually
capture
sémi
by
means
of
a
long
slender
bamboo
tipped
with
the
sound
made
by
some
kinds
of
sémi
when
caught
is
really
pitiful
quite
as
pitiful
as
the
twitter
of
a
terrified
bird
one
finds
it
difficult
to
persuade
oneself
that
the
noise
is
not
a
of
anguish
in
the
human
sense
of
the
word
voice
but
the
production
of
a
specialized
exterior
membrane
recently
on
hearing
a
captured
sémi
thus
scream
i
became
convinced
in
quite
a
new
way
that
the
stridulatory
apparatus
of
certain
insects
must
not
be
thought
of
as
a
kind
of
musical
instrument
but
as
an
organ
of
speech
and
that
its
utterances
are
as
intimately
associated
with
simple
forms
of
emotion
as
are
the
notes
of
a
bird
the
extraordinary
difference
being
that
the
insect
has
its
vocal
chords
but
the
is
altogether
a
world
of
goblins
and
fairies
creatures
with
organs
of
which
we
can
not
discover
the
use
and
senses
of
which
we
can
not
imagine
the
nature
creatures
with
myriads
of
eyes
or
with
eyes
in
their
backs
or
with
eyes
moving
about
at
the
ends
of
trunks
and
horns
creatures
with
ears
in
their
legs
and
bellies
or
with
brains
in
their
waists
if
some
of
them
happen
to
have
voices
outside
of
their
bodies
instead
of
inside
the
fact
ought
not
to
surprise
anybody
i
have
not
yet
succeeded
in
finding
any
japanese
verses
alluding
to
the
stridulatory
apparatus
of
sémi
though
i
think
it
probable
that
such
verses
exist
certainly
the
japanese
have
been
for
centuries
familiar
with
the
peculiarities
of
their
own
singing
insects
but
i
should
not
now
presume
to
say
that
their
poets
are
incorrect
in
speaking
of
the
voices
of
crickets
and
of
cicadæ
the
old
greek
poets
who
actually
describe
insects
as
producing
music
with
their
wings
and
feet
nevertheless
speak
of
the
voices
the
songs
and
the
chirruping
of
such
creatures
just
as
the
japanese
poets
do
for
example
meleager
thus
addresses
the
cricket
thou
that
art
with
shrill
wings
the
imitation
of
the
lyre
chirrup
me
something
pleasant
while
beating
your
vocal
wings
with
your
feet
ii
before
speaking
further
of
the
poetical
literature
of
sémi
i
must
attempt
a
few
remarks
about
the
sémi
themselves
but
the
reader
need
not
expect
anything
entomological
excepting
perhaps
the
butterflies
the
insects
of
japan
are
still
little
known
to
men
of
science
and
all
that
i
can
say
about
sémi
has
been
learned
from
inquiry
from
personal
observation
and
from
old
japanese
books
of
an
interesting
but
totally
unscientific
kind
not
only
do
the
authors
contradict
each
other
as
to
the
names
and
characteristics
of
the
sémi
they
attach
the
word
sémi
to
names
of
insects
which
are
not
cicadæ
the
following
enumeration
of
sémi
is
certainly
incomplete
but
i
believe
that
it
includes
the
varieties
and
the
best
melodists
i
must
ask
the
reader
however
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
time
of
the
appearance
of
certain
sémi
differs
in
different
parts
of
japan
that
the
same
kind
of
sémi
may
be
called
by
different
names
in
different
provinces
and
that
these
notes
have
been
written
in
tôkyô
various
small
sémi
appear
in
the
spring
but
the
first
of
the
big
sémi
to
make
itself
heard
is
the
also
called
and
other
names
it
makes
a
shrill
wheezing
sound
beginning
low
and
gradually
rising
to
a
pitch
of
painful
intensity
no
other
cicada
is
so
noisy
as
the
but
the
life
of
the
creature
appears
to
end
with
the
season
probably
this
is
the
sémi
referred
to
in
an
old
japanese
poem
ya
koré
wa
atsui
to
iu
hi
yori
taimu
the
day
after
the
first
day
on
which
we
exclaim
oh
how
hot
it
is
the
first
sémi
begins
to
cry
illustration
plate
ii
also
called
and
the
also
called
or
or
and
or
great
sémi
begins
to
sing
as
early
as
may
it
is
a
very
large
insect
the
upper
part
of
the
body
is
almost
black
and
the
belly
a
the
head
has
curious
red
markings
the
name
is
derived
from
the
note
of
the
creature
which
resembles
a
quick
continual
repetition
of
the
syllables
about
kyôto
this
sémi
is
common
it
is
rarely
heard
in
tôkyô
my
first
opportunity
to
examine
an
was
in
shidzuoka
its
utterance
is
much
more
complex
than

the
or

its
appearance
early
in
the
summer
i
am
told
that
it
owes
its
name
to
the
fact
that
its
shrilling
resembles
the
sound
of
oil
or
grease
frying
in
a
pan
some
writers
say
that
the
shrilling
resembles
the
sound
of
the
syllables
but
others
compare
it
to
the
noise
of
water
boiling
the
begins
to
chant
about
sunrise
then
a
great
soft
hissing
seems
to
ascend
from
all
the
trees
at
such
an
hour
when
the
foliage
of
woods
and
gardens
still
sparkles
with
dew
might
have
been
composed
the
following

only

also
called

sémi
appears
early
in
the
summer
it
makes
two
distinct
sounds
in
different
keys
resembling
the
syllables
shin
higurashi
or
this
insect
whose
name
signifies
is
the
most
remarkable
of
all
the
japanese
cicadæ
it
is
not
the
finest
singer
among
them
but
even
as
a
melodist
it
ranks
second
only
to
the
it
is
the
special
minstrel
of
twilight
singing
only
at
dawn
and
sunset
whereas
most
of
the
other
sémi
make
their
music
only
in
the
full
blaze
of
day
pausing
even
when
obscure
the
sun
in
tôkyô
the
usually
appears
about
the
end
of
june
or
the
beginning
of
july
its
wonderful
cry
beginning
always
in
a
very
high
clear
key
and
slowly
descending
is
almost
exactly
like
the
sound
of
a
good
very
quickly
rung
it
is
not
a
clashing
sound
as
of
violent
ringing
it
is
quick
steady
and
of
surprising
sonority
i
believe
that
a
single
can
be
plainly
heard
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
yet
as
the
old
japanese
poet
yayû
observed
no
matter
how
many
be
singing
together
we
never
find
them
noisy
though
powerful
and
penetrating
as
a
resonance
of
metal
the
call
is
musical
even
to
the
degree
of
sweetness
and
there
is
a
peculiar
melancholy
in
it
that
accords
with
the
hour
of
gloaming
but
the
most
astonishing
fact
in
regard
to
the
cry
of
the
is
the
individual
quality
characterizing
the
note
of
each
insect
no
two
sing
precisely
in
the
same
tone
if
you
hear
a
dozen
of
them
singing
at
once
you
will
find
that
the
timbre
of
each
voice
is
recognizably
different
from
every
other
certain
notes
ring
like
silver
others
vibrate
like
bronze
and
besides
varieties
of
timbre
suggesting
bells
of
various
weight
and
composition
there
are
even
differences
in
tone
that
suggest
different
of
bell
i
have
already
said
that
the
name
means
in
the
sense
of
twilight
gloaming
dusk
and
there
are
many
japanese
verses
containing
plays
on
the
word
the
poets
affecting
to
believe
as
in
the
following
example
that
the
crying
of
the
insect
hastens
the
coming
of
darkness
higurashi
ya
sutétéoitémo
kururu
hi
wo
o
higurashi
even
if
you
let
it
alone
day
darkens
fast
enough
this
intended
to
express
a
melancholy
mood
may
seem
to
the
western
reader
but
another
little
poem
referring
to
the
effect
of
the
sound
upon
the
conscience
of
an
idler
will
be
appreciated
by
any
one
accustomed
to
hear
the
i
may
observe
in
this
connection
that
the
first
clear
evening
cry
of
the
insect
is
quite
as
startling
as
the
sudden
ringing
of
a
bell
higurashi
ya
kyô
no
kétai

call

its
duties
left
undone
minmin
the
begins
to
sing
in
the
period
of
greatest
heat
it
is
called
because
its
note
is
thought
to
resemble
the
syllable
repeated
over
and
over
again
slowly
at
first
and
very
loudly
then
more
and
more
quickly
and
softly
till
the
utterance
dies
away
in
a
sort
of
buzz
min
the
sound
is
plaintive
and
not
unpleasing
it
is
often
compared
to
the
sound
of
the
voice
of
a
priest
chanting
the
illustration
plate
also
called
etc
opalifera
on
the
day
immediately
following
the
festival
of
the
dead
by
the
old
japanese
calendar
which
is
incomparably
more
exact
than
our
western
calendar
in
regard
to
and
manifestations
begins
to
sing
the
this
creature
may
be
said
to
sing
like
a
bird
it
is
also
called
all
onomatopoetic
appellations
the
sounds
of
its
song
have
been
imitated
in
different
ways
by
various
writers
in
izumo
the
common
version
is
that
is
to
say
upon
the
day
of
the
month
another
version
runs

but
some
say
that
the

is
there
is
a
legend
that
in
old
times
a
man
of
tsukushi
the
ancient
name
of
kyûshû
fell
sick
and
died
while
far
away
from
home
and
that
the
ghost
of
him
became
an
autumn
cicada
which
cries
unceasingly
i
long
for
tsukushi
i
want
to
see
tsukushi
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
the
earlier
sémi
have
the
harshest
and
simplest
notes
the
musical
sémi
do
not
appear
until
summer
and
the
having
the
most
complex
and
melodious
utterance
of
all
is
one
of
the
latest
to
mature
the
is
an
autumn
cicada
the
word
means
a
suspended
bell
especially
the
big
bell
of
a
buddhist
temple
i
am
somewhat
puzzled
by
the
name
for
the
insect
music
really
suggests
the
tones
of
a
japanese
harp
or
as
good
authorities
declare
perhaps
the
appellation
refers
not
to
the
boom
of
the
bell
but
to
those
deep
sweet
hummings
which
follow
after
the
peal
wave
upon
wave
this
sémi
appears
to
be
chiefly
known
in
shikoku
iii
japanese
poems
on
sémi
are
usually
very
brief
and
my
collection
chiefly
consists
of
compositions
of
seventeen
syllables
most
of
these
relate
to
the
sound
made
by
the
sémi
or
rather
to
the
sensation
which
the
sound
produced
within
the
poet
mind
the
names
attached
to
the
following
examples
are
nearly
all
names
of
poets
not
the
real
names
of
course
but
the
or
literary
names
by
which
artists
and
men
of
letters
are
usually
known
yokoi

a
japanese
poet
of
the
eighteenth
century

as
a
composer

left
us
this
naïve
record
of
the
feelings
with
which
he
heard
the
chirruping
of
cicadæ
in
summer
and
in
autumn
in
the
sultry
period
feeling
oppressed
by
the
greatness
of
the
heat
i
made
this
verse

to
the
chirruping
of

the
heat
until
i
wish
to
cut
down
the
on
which
it
sings
but
the
days
passed
quickly
and
later
when
i
heard
the
crying
of
the
sémi
grow
fainter
and
fainter
in
the
time
of
the
autumn
winds
i
began
to
feel
compassion
for
them
and
i
made
this
second
verse

remember

a
delightful
passage
about
a
japanese
house
describing
the
old
dry
woodwork
as
impregnated
with
sonority
by
the
shrilling
crickets
of

by
the
way
that

upon
sémi
but
they
possess
an
interest
altogether
exotic
as
the
metamorphosis
of
the
butterfly
supplied
to
old
greek
thought
an
emblem
of
the
soul
ascension
so
the
natural
history
of
the
cicada
has
furnished
buddhism
with
similitudes
and
parables
for
the
teaching
of
doctrine
man
sheds
his
body
only
as
the
sémi
sheds
its
skin
but
each
reincarnation
obscures
the
memory
of
the
previous
one
we
remember
our
former
existence
no
more
than
the
sémi
remembers
the
shell
from
which
it
has
emerged
often
a
sémi
may
be
found
in
the
act
of
singing
beside
its
skin
therefore
a
poet
has
written
waré
to
waga
kara
ya
tomurô
sémi
no
koë
yayû
methinks
that
sémi
sits
and
sings
by
his
former
body
chanting
the
funeral
service
over
his
own
dead
self
this
skin
or
simulacrum
clinging
to
bole
or
branch
as
in
life
and
seeming
still
to
stare
with
great
glazed
eyes
has
suggested
many
things
both
to
profane
and
to
religious
poets
in
it
is
often
likened
to
a
body
consumed
by
passionate
longing
in
buddhist
poetry
it
becomes
a
symbol
of
earthly
pomp
the
hollow
show
of
human
greatness
yo
no
naka
yo
kaëru
no
hadaka
sémi
no
kinu
naked
as
frogs
and
weak
we
enter
this
life
of
trouble
shedding
our
pomps
we
pass
so
sémi
quit
their
skins
but
sometimes
the
poet
compares
the
winged
and
shrilling
sémi
to
a
human
ghost
and
the
broken
shell
to
the
body
left
behind
tamashii
wa
ukiyo
ni
naité
sémi
no
kara
here
the
forsaken
shell
above
me
the
voice
of
the
creature
shrills
like
the
cry
of
a
soul
quitting
this
world
of
pain
then
the
great
tumult
of
the
cicadæ
landstorm
of
summer
life
foredoomed
so
soon
to
pass
away
is
likened
by
preacher
and
poet
to
the
tumult
of
human
desire
even
as
the
sémi
rise
from
earth
and
climb
to
warmth
and
light
and
clamor
and
presently
again
return
to
dust
and
silence
so
rise
and
clamor
and
pass
the
generations
of
men
yagaté
shinu
keshiki
wa
miézu
sémi
no
koë
bashô
never
an
intimation
in
all
those
voices
of
sémi
how
quickly
the
hush
will
come
how
speedily
all
must
die
i
wonder
whether
the
thought
in
this
little
verse
does
not
interpret
something
of
that
summer
melancholy
which
comes
to
us
out
of
solitudes
with
the
plaint
of
unconsciously
those
millions
of
millions
of
tiny
beings
are
preaching
the
ancient
wisdom
of
the
east
the
perpetual
sûtra
of
impermanency
yet
how
few
of
our
modern
poets
have
given
heed
to
the
voices
of
insects
perhaps
it
is
only
to
minds
inexorably
haunted
by
the
riddle
of
life
that
nature
can
speak
in
those
thin
sweet
trillings
as
she
spake
of
old
to
solomon
the
wisdom
of
the
east
hears
all
things
and
he
that
obtains
it
will
hear
the
speech
of
insects
as
sigurd
tasting
the
dragon
heart
heard
suddenly
the
talking
of
birds
for
the
pictures
of
sémi
accompanying
this
paper
i
am
indebted
to
a
curious
manuscript
work
in
several
volumes
preserved
in
the
imperial
library
at
uyéno
the
work
is
entitled
which
might
be
freely
rendered
as
pictures
and
descriptions
of
insects
and
is
divided
into
twelve
books
the
writer
name
is
unknown
but
he
must
have
been
an
amiable
and
interesting
person
to
judge
from
the
naïve
preface
which
he
wrote
apologizing
for
the
labors
of
a
lifetime
when
i
was
young
he
says
i
was
very
fond
of
catching
worms
and
insects
and
making
pictures
of
their
shapes
so
that
these
pictures
have
now
become
several
hundred
in
number
he
believes
that
he
has
found
a
good
reason
for
studying
insects
among
the
multitude
of
living
creatures
in
this
world
he
says
those
having
large
bodies
are
familiar
we
know
very
well
their
names
shapes
and
virtues
and
the
poisons
which
they
possess
but
there
remain
very
many
small
creatures
whose
natures
are
still
unknown
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
such
little
beings
as
insects
and
worms
are
able
to
injure
men
and
to
destroy
what
has
value
so
i
think
that
it
is
very
important
for
us
to
learn
what
insects
or
worms
have
special
virtues
or
poisons
it
appears
that
he
had
sent
to
him
from
other
countries
some
kinds
of
insects
that
eat
the
leaves
and
shoots
of
trees
but
he
could
not
get
their
exact
names
for
the
names
of
domestic
insects
he
consulted
many
chinese
and
japanese
books
and
has
been
able
to
write
the
names
with
the
proper
chinese
characters
but
he
tells
us
that
he
did
not
fail
to
pick
up
also
the
names
given
to
worms
and
insects
by
old
farmers
and
little
boys
the
preface
is
dated
thus
kanoté
the
third
month
at
a
little
with
the
introduction
of
scientific
studies
the
author
of
the
could
no
longer
hope
to
attract
attention
yet
his
very
modest
and
very
beautiful
work
was
forgotten
only
a
moment
it
is
now
a
precious
curiosity
and
the
old
man
ghost
might
find
some
happiness
in
a
visit
to
the
imperial
library
japanese
female
names
decoration
i
by
the
japanese
a
certain
kind
of
girl
is
called
a
perhaps
my
reader
will
think
of
of
the
of
girls
and
imagine
some
analogy
between
the
japanese
and
the
english
idea
of
femininity
symbolized
by
the
rose
but
there
is
no
analogy
whatever
the
is
not
so
called
because
she
is
delicate
and
sweet
nor
because
she
blushes
nor
because
she
is
rosy
indeed
a
rosy
face
is
not
admired
in
japan
no
she
is
compared
to
a
rose
chiefly
for
the
reason
that
a
rose
has
thorns
the
man
who
tries
to
pull
a
japanese
rose
is
likely
to
hurt
his
fingers
the
man
who
tries
to
win
a
is
apt
to
hurt
himself
much
more
seriously
even
unto
death
it
were
better
alone
and
unarmed
to
meet
a
tiger
than
to
invite
the
caress
of
a
now
the
appellation
of
much
more
rational
as
a
simile
than
many
of
our
own
floral
comparisons
can
seem
strange
only
because
it
is
not
in
accord
with
our
poetical
usages
and
emotional
habits
it
is
one
in
a
thousand
possible
examples
of
the
fact
that
japanese
similes
and
metaphors
are
not
of
the
sort
that
he
who
runs
may
read
and
this
fact
is
particularly
well
exemplified
in
the
or
personal
names
of
japanese
women
because
a
happens
to
be
identical
with
the
name
of
some
tree
or
bird
or
flower
it
does
not
follow
that
the
personal
appellation
conveys
to
japanese
imagination
ideas
resembling
those
which
the
corresponding
english
word
would
convey
under
like
circumstances
to
english
imagination
of
the
that
seem
to
us
especially
beautiful
in
translation
only
a
small
number
are
bestowed
for
æsthetic
reasons
nor
is
it
correct
to
suppose
as
many
persons
still
do
that
japanese
girls
are
usually
named
after
flowers
or
graceful
shrubs
or
other
beautiful
objects
æsthetic
appellations
are
in
use
but
the
majority
of
are
not
æsthetic
some
years
ago
a
young
japanese
scholar
published
an
interesting
essay
upon
this
subject
he
had
collected
the
personal
names
of
about
four
hundred
students
of
the
higher
normal
school
for
females
girls
from
every
part
of
the
empire
and
he
found
on
his
list
only
between
fifty
and
sixty
names
possessing
æsthetic
quality
but
concerning
even
these
he
was
careful
to
observe
only
that
they
an
æsthetic
sensation
not
that
they
had
been
given
for
æsthetic
reasons
among
them
were
such
names
as
cape
peak
beach
shore
capital
originally
stork
ricefield
stork
and
thousand
storks
also
such
appellations
as
fertile
field
weavers
field
proof
and
sand
few
of
these
could
seem
æsthetic
to
a
western
mind
and
probably
no
one
of
them
was
originally
given
for
æsthetic
reasons
names
containing
the
character
for
stork
are
names
having
reference
to
longevity
not
to
beauty
and
a
large
number
of
names
with
the
termination
field
or
plain
are
names
referring
to
moral
qualities
i
doubt
whether
even
fifteen
per
cent
of
are
really
æsthetic
a
very
much
larger
proportion
are
names
expressing
moral
or
mental
qualities
tenderness
kindness
deftness
cleverness
are
frequently
represented
by
but
appellations
implying
physical
charm
or
suggesting
æsthetic
ideas
only
are
comparatively
uncommon
one
reason
for
the
fact
may
be
that
very
æsthetic
names
are
given
to
and
to
and
consequently
vulgarized
but
the
chief
reason
certainly
is
that
the
domestic
virtues
still
occupy
in
japanese
moral
estimate
a
place
not
less
important
than
that
accorded
to
religious
faith
in
the
life
of
our
own
middle
ages
not
in
theory
only
but
in
practice
moral
beauty
is
placed
far
above
physical
beauty
and
girls
are
usually
selected
as
wives
not
for
their
good
looks
but
for
their
domestic
qualities
among
the
middle
classes
a
very
æsthetic
name
would
not
be
considered
in
the
best
taste
among
the
poorer
classes
it
would
scarcely
be
thought
respectable
ladies
of
rank
on
the
other
hand
are
privileged
to
bear
very
poetical
names
yet
the
majority
of
the
aristocratic
yobina
also
are
moral
rather
than
æsthetic
but
the
first
great
difficulty
in
the
way
of
a
study
of
is
the
difficulty
of
translating
them
a
knowledge
of
spoken
japanese
can
help
you
very
little
indeed
a
knowledge
of
chinese
also
is
indispensable
the
meaning
of
a
name
written
in
only
in
the
japanese
characters
can
not
be
in
most
cases
even
guessed
at
the
chinese
characters
of
the
name
can
alone
explain
it
the
japanese
essayist
already
referred
to
found
himself
obliged
to
throw
out
no
less
than
names
out
of
a
list
of
two
hundred
and
thirteen
simply
because
these
having
been
recorded
only
in
could
not
be
interpreted
give
only
the
pronunciation
and
the
pronunciation
of
a
woman
name
explains
nothing
in
a
majority
of
cases
transliterated
into
romaji
a
may
signify
two
three
or
even
different
things
one
of
the
names
thrown
out
of
the
list
was
might
signify
mint
the
plant
which
would
be
a
pretty
name
but
it
might
also
mean
another
rejected
name
might
be
an
abbreviation
of
precious
but
it
might
just
as
well
mean
a
floor
a
third
example
might
signify
future
yet
it
could
also
mean
a
descendant
and
various
other
things
my
reader
will
be
able
to
find
many
other
homonyms
in
the
lists
of
names
given
further
on
in
romaji
for
instance
may
signify
either
love
or
a
butterfly
or
superior
or
long
either
sagacious
or
blooming
either
rapture
or
reverence
either
native
home
or
sugar
either
year
or
tall
honorable
or
falcon
the
chief
and
for
the
present
insuperable
obstacle
to
the
use
of
roman
letters
in
writing
japanese
is
the
prodigious
number
of
homonyms
in
the
language
you
need
only
glance
into
any
good
dictionary
to
understand
the
gravity
of
this
obstacle
not
to
multiply
examples
i
shall
merely
observe
that
there
are
nineteen
words
spelled
spelled
spelled
or
and
no
less
than
spelled
or
yet
as
i
have
already
suggested
the
real
signification
of
a
name
can
not
be
ascertained
even
from
a
literal
translation
made
with
the
help
of
the
chinese
characters
such
a
name
for
instance
as
mirror
really
signifies
the
and
this
not
in
the
occidental
but
in
the
confucian
sense
of
the
term
is
a
name
referring
to
wifely
devotion
and
virtue
pine
does
not
refer
as
an
appellation
to
the
beauty
of
the
tree
but
to
the
fact
that
its
evergreen
foliage
is
the
emblem
of
vigorous
age
the
name
bamboo
is
given
to
a
child
only
because
the
bamboo
has
been
for
centuries
a
symbol
of
the
name
sounds
charmingly
to
western
fancy
yet
it
expresses
nothing
more
than
the
parents
hope
of
long
life
for
their
daughter
and
her
offspring
being
supposed
to
live
for
thousands
of
years
again
many
names
are
of
so
strange
a
sort
that
it
is
impossible
to
discover
their
meaning
without
questioning
either
the
bearer
or
the
giver
and
sometimes
all
inquiry
proves
vain
because
the
original
meaning
has
been
long
forgotten
before
attempting
to
go
further
into
the
subject
i
shall
here
offer
a
translation
of
the
tôkyô

rearranged

alphabetical
order
without
honorific
prefixes
or
suffixes

some
classes

the

serve
to
show
the

of
many
still

also
to
illustrate
several
of
the

the
positive
as
opposed
to
negative
or
feminine
in
the
old
chinese
philosophy
therefore
perhaps
masculine
rice
in
the
old
sense
of
wealth
the
good
good
field
the
valiant
lily
it
will
be
observed
that
in
the
above
list
the
names
referring
to
constancy
forbearance
and
filial
piety
have
the
highest
numbers
attached
to
them
ii
a
few
of
the
more
important
rules
in
regard
to
japanese
female
names
must
now
be
mentioned
the
great
majority
of
these
are
words
of
two
syllables
personal
names
of
respectable
women
belonging
to
the
middle
and
lower
classes
are
nearly
always
dissyllables
except
in
cases
where
the
name
is
lengthened
by
certain
curious
suffixes
which
i
shall
speak
of
further
on
formerly
a
name
of
three
or
more
syllables
indicated
that
the
bearer
belonged
to
a
superior
class
but
even
among
the
upper
classes
female
names
of
only
two
syllables
are
in
fashion
among
the
people
it
is
customary
that
a
female
name
of
two
syllables
should
be
preceded
by
the
honorific
o
and
followed
by
the
title
san
as
the
honorable
miss
or
pine
the
honorable
miss
but
if
the
name
happen
to
have
three
syllables
the
honorific
o
is
not
used
a
woman
named
is
not
addressed
as
san
but
only
as
kikuë
san
under
certain
conditions
of
intimacy
both
prefix
and
title
are
dropped
they
are
dropped
also
by
the
superior
in
addressing
an
inferior
for
example
a
lady
would
not
address
her
maid
as
but
merely
as
before
the
names
of
ladies
the
honorific
o
is
no
longer
used
as
formerly
even
when
the
name
consists
of
one
syllable
only
instead
of
the
prefix
an
honorific
suffix
is
appended
to
the
the
suffix
a
peasant
girl
named
would
be
addressed
by
her
equals
as
but
a
lady
of
the
same
name
would
be
addressed
as
shimoda
of
the
peeresses
school
for
example
has
the
beautiful
name
she
would
be
addressed
by
letter
as
shimoda
utako
and
would
so
sign
herself
in
replying
the
by
japanese
custom
always
preceding
the
personal
name
instead
of
being
as
with
us
placed
after
it
this
suffix
is
written
with
the
chinese
character
meaning
child
and
must
not
be
confused
with
the
word
written
with
a
different
chinese
character
and
meaning
little
which
so
often
appears
in
the
names
of
dancing
girls
i
should
venture
to
say
that
this
genteel
suffix
has
the
value
of
a
caressing
diminutive
and
that
the
name
might
be
fairly
well
rendered
by
the
amoretta
of
spenser
be
this
as
it
may
a
japanese
lady
named
or
would
not
be
addressed
in
these
days
as
or
but
as
setsuko
or
sadako
on
the
other
hand
if
a
woman
of
the
people
were
to
sign
herself
as
setsuko
or
sadako
she
would
certainly
be
laughed
at
since
the
suffix
would
give
to
her
appellation
the
meaning
of
the
lady
setsu
or
the
lady
sada
i
have
said
that
the
honorific
o
is
placed
before
the
of
women
of
the
middle
and
lower
classes
even
the
wife
of
a
would
probably
be
referred
to
as
the
honorable
mrs
but
there
are
very
remarkable
exceptions
to
this
general
rule
regarding
the
prefix
o
in
some
the
common
of
two
syllables
is
made
a
trisyllable
by
the
addition
of
a
peculiar
suffix
and
before
such
trisyllabic
names
the
o
is
never
placed
for
example
the
girls
of
wakayama
in
the
province
of
kii
usually
have
added
to
their
the
suffix
signifying
inlet
bay
frith
sometimes
river
thus
we
find
such
names
as
again
there
is
a
provincial
suffix
meaning
field
or
plain
which
is
attached
to
the
majority
of
female
names
in
certain
districts
fertile
field
plumflower
field
quiet
field
coast
field
song
field
are
typical
names
of
this
class
a
girl
called
or
is
not
addressed
as
san
or
san
but
as
namië
san
kikuno
san
this
suffix
must
not
be
confused
with
the
suffix
signifying
branch
which
is
also
attached
to
many
popular
names
without
seeing
the
chinese
character
you
can
not
decide
whether
the
name
for
example
means
or
jewel
inlet
san
abbreviation
of
a
word
originally
meaning
form
appearance
when
placed
after
a
female
name
corresponds
to
either
our
miss
or
placed
after
a
man
name
it
has
at
least
the
value
of
our
perhaps
even
more
the
unabbreviated
form
is
placed
after
the
names
of
high
personages
of
either
sex
and
after
the
names
of
divinities
the
shintô
gods
are
styled
the
which
might
be
translated
as
the
lords
supreme
the
bodhisattva
jizô
is
called
the
lord
jizô
a
lady
may
also
be
styled
sama
a
lady
called
for
instance
might
very
properly
be
addressed
as
ayako
sama
but
when
a
lady
name
independently
of
the
suffix
consists
of
more
than
three
syllables
it
is
customary
to
drop
either
the
or
the
title
thus
the
lady
ayamé
would
not
be
spoken
of
as
ayaméko
sama
but
more
euphoniously
as
ayamé
sama
or
as
ayaméko
ayamé
sama
however
is
rather
familiar
and
this
form
can
not
be
used
by
a
stranger
in
verbal
address
though
a
letter
may
be
directed
with
the
name
so
written
as
a
rule
the
is
the
more
respectful
form
so
much
having
been
said
as
regards
the
etiquette
of
prefixes
and
suffixes
i
shall
now
attempt
a
classification
of
female
names
beginning
with
popular
these
will
be
found
particularly
interesting
because
they
reflect
something
of
in
the
matter
of
ethics
and
æsthetics
and
because
they
serve
to
illustrate
curious
facts
relating
to
japanese
custom
the
first
place
i
have
given
to
names
of
purely
moral
meaning
usually
bestowed
in
the
hope
that
the
children
will
grow
up
worthy
of
them
but
the
lists
should
in
no
case
be
regarded
as
complete
they
are
only
representative
furthermore
i
must
confess
my
inability
to
explain
the
reason
of
many
names
which
proved
as
much
of
riddles
to
japanese
friends
as
to
myself
names
of
virtues
and
proprieties
love
intelligence
loyalty
tenderness
humanity
forgiveness
pardon
wise
in
the
sense
of
moral
discernment
filial
piety
righteous
just
the
way
doctrine
honor
wifely
fidelity
the
upright
honest
the
faithful
propriety
in
the
old
chinese
sense
chaste
and
true
the
generous
magnanimous
the
chaste
truth
faith
in
the
sense
of
fidelity
trust
the
tranquil
fidelity
wifely
virtue
a
name
suggesting
unselfishness
the
docile
in
the
meaning
of
virtuous
obedience
virtue
the
friend
especially
in
the
meaning
of
mate
companion
constancy
the
amiable
gentle
the
good
the
respectful
the
next
list
will
appear
at
first
sight
more
heterogeneous
than
it
really
is
it
contains
a
larger
variety
of
appellations
than
the
previous
list
but
nearly
all
of
the
refer
to
some
good
quality
which
the
parents
trust
that
the
child
will
display
or
to
some
future
happiness
which
they
hope
that
she
will
deserve
to
the
latter
category
belong
such
names
of
felicitation
as
and
miscellaneous
names
expressing
personal
qualities
or
parental
hopes
the

no
japanese
female
name
could
have

more
probably
the
reference
is
to

the

the

the

such
is
the

of

can
not
understand
the
name
a
buddhist
explanation
suggests
itself
but
there
are
few
if
any
buddhist
beautiful
generations
deep
snow
this
beautiful
name
refers
to
the
silence
and
calm
following
a
heavy
snowfall
but
even
for
the
japanese
it
is
an
æsthetic
name
also
suggesting
both
tranquillity
and
beauty
origin
friendship
trust
pleasure
the
name
seems
curious
in
view
of
the
common
proverb
wa

no
pleasure
is
the
seed
of
pain
bliss
the
talented

the
refined
in
the
sense
of
sifted
the
forsaken
foundling
not
necessarily
a
real
foundling
sometimes
the
name
may
be
explained
by
a
curious
old
custom
in
a
certain
family
several
children
in
succession
die
shortly
after
birth
it
is
decided
according
to
traditional
usage
that
the
next
child
born
must
be
exposed
a
girl
is
the
next
child
born
she
is
carried
by
a
servant
to
some
lonely
place
in
the
fields
or
elsewhere
and
left
there
then
a
peasant

to
the

of
the
girl
will
you
not
take
care
of
it
the
child
is
received
and
named
suté
the
foundling
by
this
innocent
artifice
it
was
formerly
and
perhaps
in
some
places
is
still
supposed
that
those
unseen
influences
which
had
caused
the
death
of
the
other
children
might
be
thwarted
the
exquisite
the

the

eternally

the

is
a

in

it
was
the
name
of
the
mother
of
yoshitsuné
her
touching
story
and
especially
the
episode
of
her
flight
through

been
a
source
of
inspiration
to
generations
of

the
young

geographical
names
are
common
but
they
are
particularly
difficult
to
explain
a
child
may
be
called
after
a
place
because
born
there
or
because
the
parental
home
was
there
or
because
of
beliefs
belonging
to
the
old
chinese
philosophy
regarding
direction
and

i
must
confess
that
in
classing
this
name
as
a
i
am
only
making
a
guess
it
seems
to
me
that
the
name
probably
refers
to
the
no
or
chief
shintô
temple
of
some
province
gate
i
fancy
that
this
name
like
that
of
must
have
originated
in
the
custom
of
naming
children
after
the
place
or
neighborhood
where
the
family
lived
but
here
again
i
am
guessing
village

this
classification
also
is
a
guess
i
could
learn
nothing
about

the
curious

that

the
next
list
is
a
curious
medley
so
far
as
regards
the
quality
of
the
comprised
in
it
some
are
really
æsthetic
and
pleasing
others
industrial
only
while
a
few
might
be
taken
for
nicknames

the
most
disagreeable

and
those
which
signify

hard
substances

as

intended
to
suggest
firmness

the

five
are

literally

four
of
them
at

names
relating
to
number
are
very
common
but
also
very
interesting
they
may
be
loosely
divided
into
two
names
indicating
the
order
or
the
time
of
birth
and
names
of
felicitation
such
as
usually
refer
to
the
order
of
birth
but
sometimes
they
record
the
date
of
birth
for
example
i
know
a
person
called
who
received
this
name
not
because
she
was
the
sixth
child
born
in
the
family
but
because
she
entered
this
world
upon
the
sixth
day
of
the
sixth
month
of
the
sixth
meiji
it
will
be
observed
that
the
numbers
two
five
and
nine
are
not
represented
in
the
list
the
mere
idea
of
such
names
as
or
seems
to
a
japanese
absurd
i
do
not
know
exactly
why
unless
it
be
that
they
suggest
unpleasant
puns
the
place
of
is
well
supplied
however
by
the
name
next
which
will
be
found
in
a
subsequent
list
names
signifying
numbers
ranging
from
eighty
to

names
of

the

all
half

half
the
reader
may

but
i
believe
that
this
name
originated
in
the
old
custom
of
taking
a
single
character
of
the
father
name
sometimes
also
a
character
of
the
mother
name
to
compose
the
child
name
with
perhaps
in
this
case
the
name
of
the

hanyémon
or
hanbei
how
many
other
names

beginning
next
the
second

stop
cease
last
some
few
of
the
next
group
of
names
are
probably
æsthetic
but
such
names
are
sometimes
given
only
in
reference
to
the
time
or
season
of
birth
and
the
reason
for
any
particular
of
this
class
is
difficult
to
decide
without
personal
inquiry

another
class
of
a

of
this
kind
generally
represents
the
hope
that
the
child
will
develop
some
quality
or
capacity
symbolized
by
the
creature
after
which
it
has
been
called
names
such
as
dragon
tiger
bear
are
intended
in
most
cases
to
represent
moral
rather
than
other
qualities
the
moral
symbolism
of
the
carp
is
too
to

explanation
here
the
names
and
refer
to
longevity
curious
as
the
fact
may
seem
is
a
name
of
endearment
names
of
birds
fishes
animals
etc
sanderling
tortoise
carp
filly
or
pony
bear
dragon
deer
bream
hawk
cuttlefish
dragon
tiger
bird
stork
sometimes
this
name
is
shortened
into
in
tôkyô
at
the
present
time
it
is
the
custom
to
drop
the
honorific
o
before
such
abbreviations
and
to
add
to
the
name
the
suffix
chan
as
in
the
case
of
children
names
thus
a
young
woman
may
be
caressingly
addressed
as
for
for
etc
eagle
even
which
are
the
names
of
flowers
or
fruits
plants
or
trees
are
in
most
cases
names
of
moral
or
felicitous
rather
than
of
æsthetic
meaning
the
plumflower
is
an
emblem
of
feminine
virtue
the
chrysanthemum
of
longevity
the
pine
both
of
longevity
and
constancy
the
bamboo
of
fidelity
the
cedar
of
moral
rectitude
the
willow
of
docility
and
gentleness
as
well
as
of
physical
grace
the
symbolism
of
the
lotos
and
of
the
cherryflower
are
probably
familiar
but
such
names
as
blossom
and
petal
are
æsthetic
in
the
true
sense
and
the
lily
remains
in
japan
as
elsewhere
an
emblem
of
feminine
grace

yet
this

may
possibly
have
been
written
with
the
wrong

there
is
another
momo
signifying

as
in
the
phrase
for
a
hundred
ages
oak
willow
slender
bamboo
reed
cedar
bamboo
ivy
a
certainly
but
the
here
is
probably
an
abbreviation
of
the
of
a
particular
species
of
young
names
signifying
light
or
color
seem
to
us
the
most
æsthetic
of
all
and
they
probably
seem
so
to
the
japanese
nevertheless
the
relative
purport
even
of
these
names
can
not
be
divined
at
sight
colors
have
moral
and
other
values
in
the
old
and
an
appellation
that
to
the
western
mind
suggests
only
luminosity
or
beauty
may
actually
refer
to
moral
or
social
distinction
to
the
hope
that
the
girl
so
named
will
become
illustrious
names
signifying
brightness
new

is
an
abbreviation
of
mikazuki

the
shining

the
glossy
lustrous

indigo
red
color
deep
blue
dark
black
green
purple
and
especially
the
latter
should
properly
be
classed
with
aristocratic
and
both
are
very
rare
i
could
find
neither
in
the
collection
of
aristocratic
names
which
was
made
for
me
from
the
records
of
the
peeresses
school
but
i
discovered
a
midori
in
a
list
of
names
being
remarkably
few
among
i
thought
it
better
in
this
instance
to
group
the
whole
of
them
together
independently
of
white
the
following
and
final
group
of
female
names
contains
several
queer
puzzles
japanese
girls
are
sometimes
named
after
the
family
crest
and
heraldry
might
explain
one
or
two
of
these
but
why
a
girl
should
be
called
a
ship
i
am
not
sure
of
being
able
to
guess
perhaps
some
reader
may
be
reminded
of
nietzsche
little
brig
called
angeline
angeline
they
call
me
so
now
a

one
time
a

ah
and
evermore
a
maid
love
the
steersman
to
and
fro
turns
the
wheel
so
finely
made
but
such
a
fancy
would
not
enter
into
a
japanese
mind
i
find
however
in
a
list
of
family
crests
two
varieties
of
design
representing
a
ship
twenty
representing
an
arrow
and
two
representing
a
bow
names
difficult
to
classify
or
explain
raiment
clothing
possibly
this
name
belongs
to
the
same
class
as
embroidery
the
dyer
but
i
am
not
sure
ship
or
boat
doll
a
paper
doll
probably
a
name
of
caress
the
word
is
applied
especially
to
the
little
paper
dolls
made
by
hand
for
amusement
representing
young
ladies
with
elaborate
coiffure
and
it
is
also
given
to
the
dolls
representing
courtly
personages
in
full
ceremonial
costume
the
true
doll
is
called
this
still
more
palanquin
thunder
sort
kind
species
little
bell
perhaps
this
name
is
given
because
of
the
sweet
sound
of
the
a
tiny
metal
ball
with
a
little
stone
or
other
hard
object
inside
to
make
the
it
is
a
pretty
japanese
custom
to
put
one
of
these
little
in
the
silk
which
is
attached
to
a
child
girdle
the
rings
with
every
motion
that
the
child
makes
somewhat

before
passing
on
to
the
subject
of
aristocratic
names
i
must
mention
an
old
rule
for
japanese
names
a
curious
rule
that
might
help
to
account
for
sundry
puzzles
in
the
preceding
lists
this
rule
formerly
applied
to
all
personal
names
masculine
or
feminine
it
can
not
be
fully
explained
in
the
present
paper
for
a
satisfactory
explanation
would
occupy
at
least
fifty
pages
but
stated
in
the
briefest
possible
way
the
rule
is
that
the
first
or
of
a
personal
name
should
be
made
to
accord
in
the
chinese
philosophic
sense
with
the
supposed
or
nature
of
the
person
to
whom
the
name
is
given
the
required
accordance
being
decided
not
by
the
meaning
but
by
the
sound
of
the
chinese
written
character
some
vague
idea
of
the
difficulties
of
the
subject
may
be
obtained

iii
for
examples
of
contemporary
aristocratic
names
i
consulted
the
reports
of
the
peeresses
school
published
between
the
nineteenth
and
years
of
meiji
the
admits
other
students
besides
daughters
of
the
nobility
but
for
present
purposes
the
names
of
the
latter
only
to
the
number
of
one
hundred
and
have
been
selected
it
will
be
observed
that
names
of
three
or
more
syllables
are
rare
among
these
and
also
that
the
modern
aristocratic
of
two
syllables
as
pronounced
and
explained
differ
little
from
ordinary
but
as
written
in
chinese
they
differ
greatly
from
other
female
names
being
in
most
cases
represented
by
characters
of
a
complex
and
unfamiliar
kind
the
use
of
these
more
elaborate
characters
chiefly
accounts
for
the
relatively
large
number
of
homonyms
to
be
found

iv
in
the
first
part
of
this
paper
i
suggested
that
the
custom
of
giving
very
poetical
names
to
and
to
might
partly
account
for
the
unpopularity
of
purely
æsthetic
and
in
the
hope
of
correcting
certain
foreign
misapprehensions
i
shall
now
venture
a
few
remarks
about
the
names
of
like
other
classes
of
names
although
full
of
curious
interest
and
often
in
themselves
really
beautiful
have
become
hopelessly
vulgarized
by
association
with
a
calling
the
reverse
of
respectable
strictly
speaking
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
subject
of
the
present
study
inasmuch
as
they
are
not
real
personal
names
but
professional
appellations
only
not
but
a
large
proportion
of
such
names
can
be
distinguished
by
certain
prefixes
or
suffixes
attached
to
them
they
can
be
known
for
example
by
the
prefix
signifying
young
as
in
the
names
young
grass
young
stork
young
purple
young
filly
by
the
prefix
signifying
little
as
in
the
names
little
charm
little
flower
little
by
the
suffix
signifying
dragon
the
ascending
dragon
being
especially
a
symbol
of
success
as
by
the
suffix
signifying
to
serve
to
administer
as
in
the
names
by
the
suffix
signifying
help
as
in
the
names
by
the
suffix
signifying
luck
fortune
as
by
the
suffix
signifying
chrysanthemum
as
three
chrysanthemums
little
chrysanthemum
by
the
suffix
tsuru
signifying
stork
emblem
of
longevity
as
little
stork
these
forms
will
serve
for
illustration
but
there
are
others
are
written
as
a
general
rule
with
only
two
chinese
characters
and
are
pronounced
as
three
or
as
four
syllables
of
five
syllables
are
occasionally
to
be
met
with
of
only
two
syllables
are
rare
at
least
among
names
of
dancing
girls
and
these
professional
appellations
have
seldom
any
moral
meaning
they
signify
things
relating
to
longevity
wealth
pleasure
youth
or
luck
perhaps
especially
to
luck
of
late
years
it
became
a
fashion
among
certain
classes
of
in
the
capital
to
assume
real
names
with
the
genteel
suffix
and
even
aristocratic
in
some
of
the
tôkyô
newspapers
demanded
legislative
measures
to
check
the
practice
this
incident
would
seem
to
afford
proof
of
public
feeling
upon
the
subject
old
japanese
songs
decoration
this
new
year
morning
i
find
upon
my
table
two
most
welcome
gifts
from
a
young
poet
of
my
literary
class
one
is
a
roll
of
cloth
for
a
new
kimono
cloth
such
as
my
western
reader
never
saw
the
brown
warp
is
cotton
thread
but
the
woof
is
soft
white
paper
string
irregularly
speckled
with
black
when
closely
examined
the
black
specklings
prove
to
be
chinese
and
japanese
characters
for
the
paper
woof
is
made
out
of
manuscript
manuscript
of
poems
which
has
been
deftly
twisted
into
fine
cord
with
the
written
surface
outwards
the
general
effect
of
the
white
black
and
brown
in
the
texture
is
a
warm
in
many
izumo
homes
a
similar
kind
of
cloth
is
manufactured
for
family
use
but
this
piece
was
woven
especially
for
me
by
the
mother
of
my
pupil
it
will
make
a
most
comfortable
and
when
wearing
it
i
shall
be
literally
clothed
with
poetry
even
as
a
divinity
might
be
clothed
with
the
sun
the
other
gift
is
poetry
also
but
poetry
in
the
original
state
a
wonderful
manuscript
collection
of
japanese
songs
gathered
from
unfamiliar
sources
and
particularly
interesting
from
the
fact
that
nearly
all
of
them
are
furnished
with
refrains
there
are
hundreds
of
compositions
old
and
new
including
several
extraordinary
ballads
many
and
a
surprising
variety
of
neither
in
sentiment
nor
in
construction
do
any
of
these
resemble
the
japanese
poetry
of
which
i
have
already
in
previous
books
offered
specimens
in
translation
the
forms
are
in
most
cases
curiously
irregular
but
their
irregularity
is
not
without
a
strange
charm
of
its
own
i
am
going
to
offer
examples
of
these
compositions
partly
because
of
their
unfamiliar
emotional
quality
and
partly
because
i
think
that
something
can
be
learned
from
their
strange
art
of
construction
the
older
songs
selected
from
the
antique
drama
seem
to
me
particularly
worthy
of
notice
the
thought
or
feeling
and
its
utterance
are
supremely
simple
yet
by
primitive
devices
of
reiteration
and
of
pause
very
remarkable
results
have
been
obtained
what
strikes
me
especially
noteworthy
in
the
following
specimen
is
the
way
that
the
phrase
begun
with
the
third
line
of
the
first
stanza
and
interrupted
by
a
kind
of
burthen
is
repeated
and
finished
in
the
next
stanza
perhaps
the
suspension
will
recall
to
western
readers
the
effect
of
some
english
ballads
with
double
refrains
or
of
such
quaint
forms
of
french
song
as
the
famous
au
jardin
de
mon
père
mon
coeur
vole
il
y
a
un
pommier
doux
doux
but
in
the
japanese
song
the
reiteration
of
the
broken
phrase
produces
a
slow
dreamy
effect
as
unlike
the
effect
of
the
french
composition
as
the
movements
of
a
japanese
dance
are
unlike
those
of
any
western

there
is
the

peculiar

of

and

of
the
quadruple
repetition
is
emotionally

such
a

was
called
a

many

a

plan
the

ten

the
first
syllable
of
each
should
correspond
in
sound
to
the
first
syllable

chinese
numerals
are
used
sometimes
japanese
but
the
rule
is
not
always
perfectly
observed
in
the

example
it
will
be
observed
that
the
correspondence
of
the
first
two
syllables
in
the

two
syllables
of

example
of
this
mnemonic
arrangement
is
furnished
by
a
children
song
composed
at

a
hundred
years
ago
little
girls
of
yedo
used
to
sing
it
while
playing
ball
you
can
see
the
same
being
played
by
girls
in
almost
any
quiet
street
of
tôkyô
the
ball
is
kept
bounding
in
a
nearly
perpendicular
line
by
skilful
taps
of
the
hand
delivered
in
time
to
the
measure
of
a
song
and
a
good
player
should
be
able
to
sing
the
song
through
without
missing
a
stroke
if
she
misses
she
must
yield
the
ball
to
another
player
there
are
many
pretty
songs
but
this
and
one
is
a
moral
curiosity
this
is
the
more
common
form
of
the
game

there

the
word

that

the

the

surely
guard
us

in

to
become
a
person
held
in
honor
as
a
filial
person
one
must
first
be
known
the
reader
may
think
to
himself
how
terribly
exigent
the
training
that
could
require
the
repetition
of
moral
lessons
even
in
a
song
true
but
it
produced
perhaps
the
very
sweetest
type
of
woman
that
this
world
has
ever
known
in
some
the
burthen
is
made
by
the
mere
repetition
of
the
last
line
or
of
part
of
the
last
line
of
each
stanza
the
following
queer
ballad
exemplifies
the
practice
and
is
furthermore
remarkable
by
reason
of
the
curious
onomatopoetic
choruses
introduced
at
certain
passages
of
the
recitative

of

the
beach
of
shirotaka
he
saw
a
little
girl
three
years
old
and
he
petted
and
hugged
her
playfully
promising
to
make
her
his
wife
chorus
thereafter
that
yamabushi
travelled
in
various
provinces
returning
only
when
that
girl
was
thirteen
years
old
o
my
princess
my
princess
he
cried
to
her
my
little
princess
pledged
to
me
by
promise
o
sir
yamabushi
made
she
answer
good

yamabushi

he
said

then
when

again
i
shall
take
you
with
me
you
with
therewith
the
yamabushi
escaping
from
her
quickly
quickly
fled
away
with
all
haste
he
fled
away
having
passed
through
tanabé
and
passed
through
minabé
he
fled
on
over
the
komatsu
moor
the
komatsu
kakkara
kakkara
kakkara
kakka
these
syllables
forming
a
sort
of
special
chorus
are
simply
onomatopes
intended
to
represent
the
sound
of
sandalled
feet
running
at
utmost
speed
therewith
the
damsel
pursuing
quickly
quickly
followed
after
him
with
all
speed
she
followed
after
him
having
passed
through
tanabé
and
passed
through
minabé
she
pursued
him
over
the
komatsu
moor
the
komatsu
then
the
yamabushi
fleeing
came
as
he
fled
to
the
river
of
amoda
and
cried
to
the
boatman
of
the
river
of
amoda
o
good
boatman
good

boatman
behind
me
comes
a
maid
pursuing
pray

sir

deboku
deboku
denden
these
onomatopes
chanted
by
all
the
dancers
together
in
chorus
with
appropriate
gesture
represent
the
sound
of
the
ferryman
single
oar
or
scull
working
upon
its
wooden
peg
the
syllables
have
no
meaning
in
themselves
then
the
damsel
pursuing
came
to
the
river
of
amoda
and
called
to
the
boatman
bring
hither
the
boat
take
me
over
in
the
boat
no
i
will
not
bring
the
boat
i
will
not
take
you
over
my
boat
is
forbidden
to
carry
women
to
carry
women
if
you
do
not
take
me
over
i
will
cross
if
you
do
not
take
me
over
i
will
cross
there
is
a
way
to
cross
the
river
of
amoda
taking
off
her
sandals
and
holding
them
aloft
she
entered
the
water
and
at
once
turned
into
a
dragon
with
twelve
horns
fully
grown
twelve
horns
fully
then
the
yamabushi
fleeing
reached
the
temple
dôjôji
and
cried
to
the
priests
of
the
temple
dôjôji
o
good
priests
behind
me
a
damsel
comes
pursuing
hide
me
i
beseech
you
good
sir
priests
sir
priests
then
the
priests
after
holding
consultation
took
down
from
its
place
the
big
bell
of
the
temple
and
under
it
they
hid
him
it
they
hid
then
the
pursuing
followed
him
to
the
temple
dôjôji
for
a
moment
she
stood
in
the
gate
of
the
temple
she
saw
that
bell
and
viewed
it
with
suspicion
she
thought
i
must
wrap
myself
about
it
once
she
thought
i
must
wrap
myself
about
it
twice
at
the
third
wrapping
the
bell
was
melted
and
began
to
flow
like
boiling
water
boiling
so
is
told
the
story
of
the
wrapping
of
the
bell
many
damsels
dwell
by
the
seashore
of
japan
but
who
among
them
like
the
daughter
of
the
chôja
will
become
a
dragon
a
dragon
this
is
all
the
song
of
the
wrapping
of
the
bell
this
is
all
the
song
the
song
this
legend
forms
the
subject
of
several
japanese
dramas
both
ancient
and
modern
the
original
story
is
that
a
buddhist
priest
called
anchin
having
rashly
excited
the
affection
of
a
maiden
named
kiyohimé
and
being
by
reason
of
his
vows
unable
to
wed
her
sought
safety
from
her
advances
in
flight
kiyohimé
by
the
violence
of
her
frustrated
passion
therewith
became
transformed
into
a
fiery
dragon
and
in
that
shape
she
pursued
the
priest
to
the
temple
called
dôjôji
in
kumano
modern
kishû
where
he
tried
to
hide
himself
under
the
great
but
the
dragon
coiled
herself
round
the
bell
which
at
once
became
so
that
the
body
of
the
priest
was
totally
consumed
in
this
rude
ballad
kiyohimé
figures
only
as
the
daughter
of
an
the
or
rich
man
of
his
village
while
the
priest
anchin
is
changed
into
a
yamabushi
the
yamabushi
are
or
at
least
were
wandering
priests
of
the
strange
sect
called
shugendo
itinerant
exorcists
and
diviners
professing
both
shinto
and
buddhism
of
late
years
their
practices
have
been
prohibited
by
law
and
a
real
yamabushi
is
now
seldom
to
be
met
with
the
temple
dôjôji
is
still
a
famous
place
of
pilgrimage
it
is
situated
not
far
from
gobô
on
the
western
coast
of
kishû
the
incident
of
anchin
and
the
dragon
is
said
to
have
occurred
in
the
early
part
of
the
tenth
century
i
shall
give
only
one
specimen
of
the
true
the
kind
of
ballad
commonly
sung
by
wandering
it
is
written
in
an
irregular
measure
varying
from
twelve
to
sixteen
syllables
in
length
the
greater
number
of
lines
having
thirteen
syllables
i
do
not
know
the
date
of
its
composition
but
i
am
told
by
aged
persons
who
remember
hearing
it
sung
when
they
were
children
that
it
was
popular
in
the
period
of
tenpô
it
is
not
divided
into
stanzas
but
there
are
pauses
at
irregular
intervals
marked
by
the
refrain
kudoki
ditty
of
and
now
hear
the
pitiful
story
of
two
that
died
for
in
kyôto
was
the
of
yoëmon
a
merchant
known
far
and
near
a
man
of
much
wealth
his
business
prospered
his
life
was
fortunate
one
daughter
he
had
an
only
child
by
name
at
sixteen
years
she
was
lovely
as
a
flower
also
he
had
a
clerk
in
his
house
by
name
seiza
just
in
the
prime
of
youth
aged
now
the
young
man
seiza
was
handsome
and
fell
in
love
with
him
at
sight
and
the
two
were
so
often
together
that
their
secret
affection
became
known
and
the
matter
came
to
the
ears
of
the
parents
of
and
the
parents
hearing
of
it
felt
that
such
a
thing
could
not
be
suffered
to
continue
so
at
last
the
mother
having
called
into
a
private
room
thus
spoke
to
her
o
my
daughter
i
hear
that
you
have
formed
a
secret
relation
with
the
young
man
seiza
of
our
shop
are
you
willing
to
end
that
relation
at
once
and
not
to
think
any
more
about
that
man
answer
me
o
my
daughter
o
my
dear
mother
answered
what
is
this
that
you
ask
me
to
do
the
closeness
of
the
relation
between
seiza
and
me
is
the
closeness
of
the
relation
of
the
ink
to
the
paper
that
it
penetrates
therefore
whatever
may
happen
o
mother
of
mine
to
separate
from
seiza
is
more
than
i
can
bear
lit
that
affinity
affinity
then
the
father
having
called
seiza
to
the
innermost
private
room
thus
spoke
to
him
i
called
you
here
only
to
tell
you
this
you
have
turned
the
mind
of
our
daughter
away
from
what
is
right
and
even
to
hear
of
such
a
matter
is
not
to
be
borne
pack
up
your
things
at
once
and
go
is
the
utmost
limit
of
the
time
that
you
remain
in
this
house
now
seiza
was
a
native
of
ôsaka
without
saying
more
than
yes
yes
he
obeyed
and
went
away
returning
to
his
home
there
he
remained
four
or
five
days
thinking
only
of
and
because
of
his
longing
for
her
he
fell
sick
and
as
there
was
no
cure
and
no
hope
for
him
he
died
then
one
night
in
a
moment
of
sleep
saw
the
face
of
seiza
close
to
her
pillow
so
plainly
that
she
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
real
or
only
a
dream
and
rising
up
she
looked
about
but
the
form
of
seiza
had
vanished
because
of
this
she
made
up
her
mind
to
go
at
once
to
the
house
of
seiza
and
without
being
seen
by
any
one
she
fled
from
the
home
of
her
parents
when
she
came
to
the
ferry
at
the
next
village
she
did
not
take
the
boat
but
went
round
by
another
road
and
making
all
haste
she
found
her
way
to
the
city
of
ôsaka
there
she
asked
for
the
house
of
seiza
and
she
learned
that
it
was
in
a
certain
street
the
third
house
from
a
certain
bridge
arriving
at
last
before
the
home
of
seiza
she
took
off
her
travelling
hat
of
straw
and
seating
herself
on
the
threshold
of
the
entrance
she
cried
out
pardon
me
kindly
is
not
this
the
house
of
master
seiza
then
o
the
pity
of
it
she
saw
the
mother
of
seiza
weeping
bitterly
and
holding
in
her
hand
a
buddhist
rosary
o
my
good
young
lady
the
mother
of
seiza
asked
whence
have
you
come
and
whom
do
you
want
to
see
and
said
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
of
kyôto
and
i
have
come
all
the
way
here
only
because
of
the
relation
that
has
long
existed
between
master
seiza
and
myself
therefore
i
pray
you
kindly
permit
me
to
see
him
alas
made
answer
the
mother
weeping
seiza
whom
you
have
come
so
far
to
see
is
dead
is
the
seventh
day
from
the
day
on
which
he
died
hearing
these
words
herself
could
only
shed
tears
but
after
a
little
while
she
took
her
way
to
the
cemetery
and
there
she
found
the
sotoba
erected
above
the
grave
of
seiza
and
leaning
upon
it
she
wept
aloud
a
wooden
lath
bearing
buddhist
texts
planted
above
graves
for
a
full
account
of
the
sotoba
see
exotics
and
the
literature
of
the
dead
then
how
fearful
a
thing
is
the
longing
of
a
person
the
grave
of
seiza
split
asunder
and
the
form
of
seiza
rose
up
therefrom
and
spoke
in
the
original
no
omoi
wa
osoroshi
mono
yo
how
fearful
a
thing
is
the
thinking
of
a
person
the
word
used
here
in
the
sense
of
longing
refers
to
the
weird
power
of
dying
wish
to
see
his
sweetheart
even
after
his
burial
this
longing
has
the
strength
to
burst
open
the
tomb
in
the
old
english
ballad
of
william
and
marjorie
see
child
vol
ii
there
is
also
a
remarkable
fancy
about
the
opening
and
closing
of
a
grave
she
followed
him
high
she
followed
him
low
till
she
came
to
yon
churchyard
green
there
the
deep
grave
opened
and
young
william
he
lay
down
ah
is
not
this
that
has
come
kind
indeed
it
was
to
have
come
to
me
from
so
far
away
my
do
not
weep
thus
never
again
even
though
you
weep
can
we
be
united
in
this
world
but
as
you
love
me
truly
i
pray
you
to
set
some
fragrant
flowers
before
my
tomb
and
to
have
a
buddhist
service
said
for
me
upon
the
anniversary
of
my
death
and
with
these
words
the
form
of
seiza
vanished
o
wait
wait
for
me
cried
wait
one
little
moment
i
can
not
let
you
return
alone
i
shall
go
with
you
in
a
little
time
with
this
episode

then
quickly
she
went

a
moat
some
four
or
five
distant
and
having
filled
her
sleeves
with
small
stones
into
the
deep
water
she
cast
her
forlorn
body
a

about
one
fifteenth

and
now
i
shall
terminate
this
brief
excursion
into
unfamiliar
by
the
citation
of
two
buddhist
pieces
the
first

the
famous

written
in
the
measure
called
that
is
to
say
in
short
lines
alternately
of
seven
and
of

the
other
philosophical

is
from
a
collection

the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
but
the
vast
of
the
night
was
all
seething
with
stars
and
bridged
by
a
milky
way
of
extraordinary
brightness
there
was
no
wind
but
the
sea
far
as
sight
could
reach
was
running
in
ripples
of
fire
a
vision
of
infernal
beauty
only
the
ripplings
were
radiant
between
them
was
blackness
absolute
and
the
luminosity
was
amazing
most
of
the
undulations
were
yellow
like
but
there
were
crimson
lampings
also
and
azure
and
orange
and
emerald
and
the
sinuous
flickering
of
all
seemed
not
a
pulsing
of
many
waters
but
a
laboring
of
many
wills
a
fleeting
conscious
and
monstrous
a
writhing
and
a
swarming
incalculable
as
of
in
some
depth
of
erebus
and
life
indeed
was
making
the
sinister
splendor
of
that
spectacle
but
life
infinitesimal
and
of
ghostliest
delicacy
life
illimitable
yet
ephemeral
flaming
and
fading
in
ceaseless
alternation
over
the
whole
round
of
waters
even
to
the
above
which
in
the
vaster
abyss
other
countless
lights
were
throbbing
with
other
spectral
colors
watching
i
wondered
and
i
dreamed
i
thought
of
the
ultimate
ghost
revealed
in
that
scintillation
tremendous
of
night
and
sea
quickening
above
me
in
systems
aglow
with
awful
fusion
of
the
past
dissolved
with
vapor
of
the
life
again
to
be
quickening
also
beneath
me
in
and
constellations
and
nebulosities
of
colder
fire
till
i
found
myself
doubting
whether
the
million
ages
of
the
could
really
signify
in
the
flux
of
perpetual
dissolution
anything
more
than
the
momentary
sparkle
of
one
expiring
noctiluca
even
with
the
doubt
the
vision
changed
i
saw
no
longer
the
sea
of
the
ancient
east
with
its
shudderings
of
fire
but
that
flood
whose
width
and
depth
and
altitude
are
one
with
the
night
of
eternity
the
shoreless
and
timeless
sea
of
death
and
birth
and
the
luminous
haze
of
a
hundred
millions
of
suns
the
arch
of
the
milky
way
was
a
single
smouldering
surge
in
the
flow
of
the
infinite
tides
yet
again
there
came
a
change
i
saw
no
more
that
vapory
surge
of
suns
but
the
living
darkness
streamed
and
thrilled
about
me
with
infinite
sparkling
and
every
sparkle
was
beating
like
a
heart
beating
out
colors
like
the
tints
of
the
and
the
lampings
of
all
continually
flowed
away
as
shivering
threads
of
radiance
into
illimitable
mystery
then
i
knew
myself
also
a
one
fugitive
floating
sparkle
of
the
measureless
current
and
i
saw
that
the
light
which
was
mine
shifted
tint
with
each
changing
of
thought
ruby
it
sometimes
shone
and
sometimes
sapphire
now
it
was
flame
of
topaz
again
it
was
fire
of
emerald
and
the
meaning
of
the
changes
i
could
not
fully
know
but
thoughts
of
the
earthly
life
seemed
to
make
the
light
burn
red
while
thoughts
of
supernal
being
of
ghostly
beauty
and
of
ghostly
bliss
seemed
to
kindle
ineffable
rhythms
of
azure
and
of
violet
but
of
white
lights
there
were
none
in
all
the
visible
and
i
marvelled
then
a
voice
said
to
me
the
white
are
of
the
altitudes
by
the
blending
of
the
billions
they
are
made
thy
part
is
to
help
to
their
kindling
even
as
the
color
of
thy
burning
so
is
the
worth
of
thee
for
a
moment
only
is
thy
quickening
yet
the
light
of
thy
pulsing
lives
on
by
thy
thought
in
that
shining
moment
thou
becomest
a
maker
of
gods
a
mystery
of
crowds
decoration
who
has
not
at
some
time
leaned
over
the
parapet
of
a
bridge
to
watch
the
wrinklings
and
dimplings
of
the
current
below
to
wonder
at
the
trembling
permanency
of
that
never
change
though
the
substance
of
them
is
never
for
two
successive
moments
the
same
the
mystery
of
the
spectacle
fascinates
and
it
is
worth
thinking
about
symbols
of
the
riddle
of
our
own
being
are
those
shuddering
forms
in
ourselves
likewise
the
substance
perpetually
changes
with
the
flow
of
the
infinite
stream
but
the
shapes
though
ever
agitated
by
various
forces
remain
throughout
the
years
and
who
has
not
been
fascinated
also
by
the
sight
of
the
human
stream
that
pours
and
pulses
through
the
streets
of
some
great
metropolis
this
too
has
its
currents
and
and
eddyings
all
strengthening
or
weakening
according
to
the
or
of
the
city
sea
of
toil
but
the
attraction
of
the
greater
spectacle
for
us
is
not
really
the
mystery
of
motion
it
is
rather
the
mystery
of
man
as
outside
observers
we
are
interested
chiefly
by
the
passing
forms
and
faces
by
their
intimations
of
personality
their
suggestions
of
sympathy
or
repulsion
we
soon
cease
to
think
about
the
general
flow
for
the
atoms
of
the
human
current
are
visible
to
our
gaze
we
see
them
walk
and
deem
their
movements
sufficiently
explained
by
our
own
experience
of
walking
and
nevertheless
the
motions
of
the
visible
individual
are
more
mysterious
than
those
of
the
always
invisible
molecule
of
i
am
not
forgetting
the
truth
that
all
forms
of
motion
are
ultimately
incomprehensible
i
am
referring
only
to
the
fact
that
our
common
relative
knowledge
of
motions
which
are
supposed
to
depend
upon
will
is
even
less
than
our
possible
relative
knowledge
of
the
behavior
of
the
atoms
of
a
every
one
who
has
lived
in
a
great
city
is
aware
of
certain
laws
of
movement
which
regulate
the
flow
of
population
through
the
more
crowded
thoroughfares
we
need
not
for
present
purposes
concern
ourselves
about
the
complex
of
the
living
river
with
their
thunder
of
hoofs
and
wheels
i
shall
speak
of
the
only
on
either
footpath
the
crowd
naturally
divides
itself
into
an
upward
and
a
downward
stream
all
persons
going
in
one
direction
take
the
side
all
going
in
the
other
direction
take
the
side
by
moving
with
either
one
of
these
two
streams
you
can
proceed
even
quickly
but
you
can
not
walk
against
it
only
a
drunken
or
insane
person
is
likely
to
attempt
such
a
thing
between
the
two
currents
there
is
going
on
by
reason
of
the
pressure
a
continual
of
individuals
to
left
and
right
alternately
such
a
yielding
and
swerving
as
might
be
represented
in
a
drawing
of
the
by
zigzag
medial
lines
ascending
and
descending
this
constant
yielding
alone
makes
progress
possible
without
it
the
contrary
streams
would
quickly
bring
each
other
to
a
standstill
by
lateral
pressure
but
it
is
especially
where
two
intersect
each
other
as
at
that
this
systematic
is
worthy
of
study
everybody
observes
the
phenomenon
but
few
persons
think
about
it
whoever
really
thinks
about
it
will
discover
that
there
is
a
mystery
in
it
a
mystery
which
no
individual
experience
can
fully
explain
in
any
thronged
street
of
a
great
metropolis
thousands
of
people
are
constantly
turning
aside
to
left
or
right
in
order
to
pass
each
other
whenever
two
persons
walking
in
contrary
directions
come
face
to
face
in
such
a
press
one
of
three
things
is
likely
to
happen
either
there
is
a
mutual
yielding
or
one
makes
room
for
the
other
or
else
both
in
their
endeavor
to
be
accommodating
step
at
once
in
the
same
direction
and
as
quickly
repeat
the
blunder
by
trying
to
correct
it
and
so
keep
dancing
to
and
fro
in
each
other
way
until
the
first
to
perceive
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
stands
still
or
until
the
more
irritable
actually
pushes
his
to
one
side
but
these
blunders
are
relatively
infrequent
all
necessary
yielding
as
a
rule
is
done
quickly
and
correctly
of
course
there
must
be
some
general
law
regulating
all
this
some
law
in
accord
with
the
universal
law
of
motion
in
the
direction
of
least
resistance
you
have
only
to
watch
any
crowded
street
for
half
an
hour
to
be
convinced
of
this
but
the
law
is
not
easily
found
or
formulated
there
are
puzzles
in
the
phenomenon
if
you
study
the
closely
you
will
perceive
that
those
encounters
in
which
one
person
yields
to
make
way
for
the
other
are
much
less
common
than
those
in
which
both
parties
give
way
but
a
little
reflection
will
convince
you
that
even
in
cases
of
mutual
yielding
one
person
must
of
necessity
yield
sooner
than
the
other
though
the
difference
in
time
of
the
should
be
as
it
often
is
altogether
inappreciable
for
the
sum
of
character
physical
and
psychical
can
not
be
precisely
the
same
in
two
human
beings
no
two
persons
can
have
exactly
equal
faculties
of
perception
and
will
nor
exactly
similar
qualities
of
that
experience
which
expresses
itself
in
mental
and
physical
activities
and
therefore
in
every
case
of
apparent
mutual
yielding
the
yielding
must
really
be
successive
not
simultaneous
now
although
what
we
might
here
call
the
personal
equation
proves
that
in
every
case
of
mutual
yielding
one
individual
necessarily
yields
sooner
than
the
other
it
does
not
at
all
explain
the
mystery
of
the
individual
impulse
in
cases
where
the
yielding
is
not
mutual
it
does
not
explain
why
you
feel
at
one
time
that
you
are
about
to
make
your
give
place
and
feel
at
another
time
that
you
must
yourself
give
place
what
originates
the
feeling
a
friend
once
attempted
to
answer
this
question
by
the
ingenious
theory
of
a
sort
of
between
every
two
persons
coming
face
to
face
in
a
but
i
feel
sure
that
his
theory
could
account
for
the
psychological
facts
in
scarcely
of
a
thousand
such
encounters
the
greater
number
of
people
hurrying
by
each
other
in
a
dense
press
rarely
observe
faces
only
the
disinterested
idler
has
time
for
that
hundreds
actually
pass
along
the
street
with
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
pavement
certainly
it
is
not
the
man
in
a
hurry
who
can
guide
himself
by
ocular
views
of
physiognomy
he
is
usually
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
i
have
studied
my
own
case
repeatedly
while
in
a
crowd
i
seldom
look
at
faces
but
without
any
conscious
observation
i
am
always
able
to
tell
when
i
should
give
way
or
when
my
is
going
to
save
me
that
trouble
my
knowledge
is
certainly
intuitive
a
mere
knowledge
of
feeling
and
i
know
not
with
what
to
compare
it
except
that
blind
faculty
by
which
in
absolute
darkness
one
becomes
aware
of
the
proximity
of
bulky
objects
without
touching
them
and
my
intuition
is
almost
infallible
if
i
hesitate
to
obey
it
a
collision
is
the
invariable
consequence
furthermore
i
find
that
whenever
automatic
or
at
least
action
is
replaced
by
reasoned
action
in
plainer
words
whenever
i
begin
to
think
about
my
movements
i
always
blunder
it
is
only
while
i
am
thinking
of
other
matters
only
while
i
am
acting
almost
automatically
that
i
can
thread
a
dense
crowd
with
ease
indeed
my
personal
experience
has
convinced
me
that
what
pilots
one
quickly
and
safely
through
a
thick
press
is
not
conscious
observation
at
all
but
unreasoning
intuitive
perception
now
intuitive
action
of
any
kind
represents
inherited
knowledge
the
experience
of
past
lives
in
this
case
the
experience
of
past
lives
incalculable
utterly
incalculable
why
do
i
think
so
well
simply
because
this
faculty
of
intuitive
in
a
crowd
is
shared
by
man
with
very
inferior
forms
of
animal
being
evolutional
proof
that
it
must
be
a
faculty
immensely
older
than
man
does
not
a
herd
of
cattle
a
herd
of
deer
a
flock
of
sheep
offer
us
the
same
phenomenon
of
mutual
yielding
or
a
flock
of
birds
gregarious
birds
especially
crows
sparrows
wild
pigeons
or
a
shoal
of
fish
even
among
insects
bees
ants
termites
we
can
study
the
same
law
of
intuitive
the
yielding
in
all
these
cases
must
still
represent
an
inherited
experience
unimaginably
old
could
we
endeavor
to
retrace
the
whole
course
of
such
inheritance
the
attempt
would
probably
lead
us
back
not
only
to
the
very
beginnings
of
sentient
life
upon
this
planet
but
further
back
into
the
history
of
substance
back
even
to
the
primal
evolution
of
those
mysterious
tendencies
which
are
stored
up
in
the
atoms
of
elements
such
atoms
we
know
of
only
as
points
of
multiple
resistance
incomprehensible
knittings
of
incomprehensible
forces
even
the
tendencies
of
atoms
doubtless
represent
accumulations
of
inheritance
but
here
thought
checks
with
a
shock
at
the
eternal
barrier
of
the
infinite
riddle
gothic
horror
decoration
i
long
before
i
had
arrived
at
what
catechisms
call
the
age
of
reason
i
was
frequently
taken
much
against
my
will
to
church
the
church
was
very
old
and
i
can
see
the
interior
of
it
at
this
moment
just
as
plainly
as
i
saw
it
forty
years
ago
when
it
appeared
to
me
like
an
evil
dream
there
i
first
learned
to
know
the
peculiar
horror
that
certain
forms
of
gothic
architecture
can
inspire
i
am
using
the
word
horror
in
a
classic
sense
in
its
antique
meaning
of
ghostly
fear
on
the
very
first
day
of
this
experience
my
could
place
the
source
of
the
horror
the
wizened
and
pointed
shapes
of
the
windows
immediately
terrified
me
in
their
outline
i
found
the
form
of
apparitions
that
tormented
me
in
sleep
and
at
once
i
began
to
imagine
some
dreadful
affinity
between
goblins
and
gothic
churches
presently
in
the
tall
doorways
in
the
archings
of
the
aisles
in
the
ribbings
and
groinings
of
the
roof
i
discovered
other
and
wilder
suggestions
of
fear
even
the
façade
of
the
organ
peaking
high
into
the
shadow
above
its
gallery
seemed
to
me
a
frightful
thing
had
i
been
then
suddenly
obliged
to
answer
the
question
what
are
you
afraid
of
i
should
have
whispered
points
i
could
not
have
otherwise
explained
the
matter
i
only
knew
that
i
was
afraid
of
the
points
of
course
the
real
enigma
of
what
i
felt
in
that
church
could
not
present
itself
to
my
mind
while
i
continued
to
believe
in
goblins
but
long
after
the
age
of
superstitious
terrors
other
gothic
experiences
severally
revived
the
childish
emotion
in
so
startling
a
way
as
to
convince
me
that
childish
fancy
could
not
account
for
the
feeling
then
my
curiosity
was
aroused
and
i
tried
to
discover
some
rational
cause
for
the
horror
i
read
many
books
and
asked
many
questions
but
the
mystery
seemed
only
to
deepen
books
about
architecture
were
very
disappointing
i
was
much
less
impressed
by
what
i
could
find
in
them
than
by
references
in
pure
fiction
to
the
awfulness
of
gothic
art
particularly
by
one
confession
that
the
interior
of
a
gothic
church
seen
at
night
gave
him
the
idea
of
being
inside
the
skeleton
of
some
monstrous
animal
and
by
a
comparison
of
the
windows
of
a
cathedral
to
eyes
and
of
its
door
to
a
great
mouth
devouring
the
people
these
imaginations
explained
little
they
could
not
be
developed
beyond
the
phase
of
vague
intimation
yet
they
stirred
such
emotional
response
that
i
felt
sure
they
had
touched
some
truth
certainly
the
architecture
of
a
gothic
cathedral
offers
strange
resemblances
to
the
architecture
of
bone
and
the
general
impression
that
it
makes
upon
the
mind
is
an
impression
of
life
but
this
impression
or
sense
of
life
i
found
to
be
indefinable
not
a
sense
of
any
life
organic
but
of
a
life
latent
and
dæmonic
and
the
manifestation
of
that
life
i
felt
to
be
in
the
of
the
structure
attempts
to
interpret
the
emotion
by
effects
of
altitude
and
gloom
and
vastness
appeared
to
me
of
no
worth
for
buildings
loftier
and
larger
and
darker
than
any
gothic
cathedral
but
of
a
different
order
of
architecture
egyptian
for
instance
could
not
produce
a
like
impression
i
felt
certain
that
the
horror
was
made
by
something
altogether
peculiar
to
gothic
construction
and
that
this
something
haunted
the
tops
of
the
arches
yes
gothic
architecture
is
awful
said
a
religious
friend
because
it
is
the
visible
expression
of
christian
faith
no
other
religious
architecture
symbolizes
spiritual
longing
but
the
gothic
embodies
it
every
part
climbs
or
leaps
every
supreme
detail
soars
and
points
like
fire
there
may
be
considerable
truth
in
what
you
say
i
replied
but
it
does
not
relate
to
the
riddle
that
baffles
me
why
should
shapes
that
symbolize
spiritual
longing
create
horror
why
should
any
expression
of
christian
ecstasy
inspire
alarm
other
hypotheses
in
multitude
i
tested
without
avail
and
i
returned
to
the
simple
and
savage
conviction
that
the
secret
of
the
horror
somehow
belonged
to
the
points
of
the
archings
but
for
years
i
could
not
find
it
at
last
at
last
in
the
early
hours
of
a
certain
tropical
morning
it
revealed
itself
quite
unexpectedly
while
i
was
looking
at
a
glorious
group
of
palms
then
i
wondered
at
my
stupidity
in
not
having
guessed
the
riddle
before
ii
the
characteristics
of
many
kinds
of
palm
have
been
made
familiar
by
pictures
and
photographs
but
the
giant
palms
of
the
american
tropics
can
not
be
adequately
represented
by
the
modern
methods
of
pictorial
illustration
they
must
be
seen
you
can
not
draw
or
photograph
a
palm
two
hundred
feet
high
the
first
sight
of
a
group
of
such
forms
in
their
natural
environment
of
tropical
forest
is
a
magnificent
surprise
a
surprise
that
strikes
you
dumb
nothing
seen
in
temperate
zones
not
even
the
huger
growths
of
the
californian
slope
could
have
prepared
your
imagination
for
the
weird
solemnity
of
that
mighty
colonnade
each
trunk
is
a
perfect
pillar
but
a
pillar
of
which
the
stupendous
grace
has
no
counterpart
in
the
works
of
man
you
must
strain
your
head
well
back
to
follow
the
soaring
of
the
prodigious
column
up
up
up
through
abysses
of
green
twilight
till
at
last
far
beyond
a
break
in
that
infinite
interweaving
of
limbs
and
lianas
which
is
the
roof
of
the
forest
you
catch
one
dizzy
glimpse
of
the
capital
a
parasol
of
emerald
feathers
outspread
in
a
sky
so
blinding
as
to
suggest
the
notion
of
azure
electricity
now
what
is
the
emotion
that
such
a
vision
excites
an
emotion
too
powerful
to
be
called
wonder
too
weird
to
be
called
delight
only
when
the
first
shock
of
it
has
passed
when
the
several
elements
that
were
combined
in
it
have
begun
to
set
in
motion
widely
different
groups
of
ideas
can
you
comprehend
how
very
complex
it
must
have
been
many
impressions
belonging
to
personal
experience
were
doubtless
revived
in
it
but
also
with
them
a
multitude
of
sensations
more
shadowy
accumulations
of
organic
memory
possibly
even
vague
feelings
older
than
man
for
the
tropical
shapes
that
aroused
the
emotion
have
a
history
more
ancient
than
our
race
one
of
the
first
elements
of
the
emotion
to
become
clearly
distinguishable
is
the
æsthetic
and
this
in
its
general
mass
might
be
termed
the
sense
of
terrible
beauty
certainly
the
spectacle
of
that
unfamiliar
life
silent
tremendous
springing
to
the
sun
in
colossal
aspiration
striving
for
light
against
titans
and
heedless
of
man
in
the
gloom
beneath
as
of
a
groping
beetle
thrills
like
the
rhythm
of
some
single
marvellous
verse
that
is
learned
in
a
glance
and
remembered
forever
yet
the
delight
even
at
its
vividest
is
shadowed
by
a
queer
disquiet
the
aspect
of
that
monstrous
pale
naked
column
suggests
a
life
as
conscious
as
the
serpent
you
stare
at
the
towering
lines
of
the
shape
vaguely
fearing
to
discern
some
sign
of
stealthy
movement
some
beginning
of
undulation
then
sight
and
reason
combine
to
correct
the
suspicion
yes
motion
is
there
and
life
enormous
but
a
life
seeking
only
sun
life
rushing
like
the
jet
of
a
geyser
straight
to
the
giant
day
iii
during
my
own
experience
i
could
perceive
that
certain
feelings
commingled
in
the
wave
of
delight
feelings
related
to
ideas
of
power
and
splendor
and
triumph
were
accompanied
by
a
faint
sense
of
religious
awe
perhaps
our
modern
æsthetic
sentiments
are
so
interwoven
with
various
inherited
elements
of
religious
emotionalism
that
the
recognition
of
beauty
can
not
arise
independently
of
reverential
feeling
be
this
as
it
may
such
a
feeling
defined
itself
while
i
gazed
and
at
once
the
great
grey
trunks
were
changed
to
the
pillars
of
a
mighty
aisle
and
from
altitudes
of
dream
there
suddenly
descended
upon
me
the
old
dark
thrill
of
gothic
horror
even
before
it
died
away
i
recognized
that
it
must
have
been
due
to
some
old
revived
by
the
vision
of
those
giant
trunks
uprising
into
gloom
but
neither
the
height
nor
the
gloom
could
account
for
anything
beyond
the
memory
columns
tall
as
those
palms
but
supporting
a
classic
entablature
could
evoke
no
sense
of
disquiet
resembling
the
gothic
horror
i
felt
sure
of
this
because
i
was
able
without
any
difficulty
to
shape
immediately
the
imagination
of
such
a
façade
but
presently
the
mental
picture
distorted
i
saw
the
architrave
elbow
upward
in
each
of
the
spaces
between
the
pillars
and
curve
and
point
itself
into
a
range
of
prodigious
arches
and
again
the
sombre
thrill
descended
upon
me
simultaneously
there
flashed
to
me
the
solution
of
the
mystery
i
understood
that
the
gothic
horror
was
a
of
monstrous
and
that
it
had
seemed
to
belong
to
the
points
of
the
arches
because
the
idea
of
such
motion
was
chiefly
suggested
by
the
extraordinary
angle
at
which
the
curves
of
the
arching
touched
to
any
experienced
eye
the
curves
of
gothic
arching
offer
a
striking
resemblance
to
certain
curves
of
vegetal
growth
the
curves
of
the
being
perhaps
especially
suggested
but
observe
that
the
architectural
form
suggests
more
than
any
vegetal
comparison
could
illustrate
the
meeting
of
two
would
indeed
form
a
kind
of
gothic
arch
yet
the
effect
of
so
short
an
arch
would
be
insignificant
for
nature
to
repeat
the
strange
impression
of
the
real
gothic
arch
it
were
necessary
that
the
branches
of
the
touching
crests
should
vastly
exceed
both
in
length
of
curve
and
strength
of
spring
anything
of
their
kind
existing
in
the
vegetable
world
the
effect
of
the
gothic
arch
depends
altogether
upon
the
intimation
of
energy
an
arch
formed
by
the
intersection
of
two
short
sprouting
lines
could
suggest
only
a
feeble
power
of
growth
but
the
lines
of
the
tall
mediæval
arch
seem
to
express
a
crescent
force
immensely
surpassing
that
of
nature
and
the
horror
of
gothic
architecture
is
not
in
the
mere
suggestion
of
a
growing
life
but
in
the
suggestion
of
an
energy
supernatural
and
tremendous
of
course
the
child
oppressed
by
the
strangeness
of
gothic
forms
is
yet
incapable
of
analyzing
the
impression
received
he
is
frightened
without
comprehending
he
can
not
divine
that
the
points
and
the
curves
are
terrible
to
him
because
they
represent
the
prodigious
exaggeration
of
a
real
law
of
vegetal
growth
he
dreads
the
shapes
because
they
seem
alive
yet
he
does
not
know
how
to
express
this
dread
without
suspecting
why
he
feels
that
this
silent
manifestation
of
power
everywhere
pointing
and
piercing
upward
is
not
natural
to
his
startled
imagination
the
building
stretches
itself
like
a
phantasm
of
sleep
makes
itself
tall
and
taller
with
intent
to
frighten
even
though
built
by
hands
of
men
it
has
ceased
to
be
a
mass
of
dead
stone
it
is
infused
with
something
that
thinks
and
threatens
it
has
become
a
shadowing
malevolence
a
multiple
goblinry
a
monstrous
fetish
levitation
decoration
out
of
some
window
i
was
looking
into
a
street
of
houses
a
colonial
street
narrow
with
showing
above
its
roofs
of
tile
there
were
no
shadows
there
was
no
sun
only
a
grey
soft
light
as
of
early
gloaming
suddenly
i
found
myself
falling
from
the
window
and
my
heart
gave
one
sickening
leap
of
terror
but
the
distance
from
window
to
pavement
proved
to
be
much
greater
than
i
supposed
so
great
that
in
spite
of
my
fear
i
began
to
wonder
still
i
kept
falling
falling
and
still
the
dreaded
shock
did
not
come
then
the
fear
ceased
and
a
queer
pleasure
took
its
place
for
i
discovered
that
i
was
not
falling
quickly
but
only
down
moreover
i
was
floating
feet
foremost
must
have
turned
in
descending
at
last
i
touched
the
stones
but
very
very
lightly
with
only
one
foot
and
instantly
at
that
touch
i
went
up
again
rose
to
the
level
of
the
eaves
people
stopped
to
stare
at
me
i
felt
the
exultation
of
power
superhuman
i
felt
for
the
moment
as
a
god
then
softly
i
began
to
sink
and
the
sight
of
faces
gathering
below
me
prompted
a
sudden
resolve
to
fly
down
the
street
over
the
heads
of
the
gazers
again
like
a
bubble
i
rose
and
with
the
same
impulse
i
sailed
in
one
grand
curve
to
a
distance
that
astounded
me
i
felt
no
wind
i
felt
nothing
but
the
joy
of
motion
triumphant
once
more
touching
pavement
i
soared
at
a
bound
for
a
thousand
yards
then
reaching
the
end
of
the
street
i
wheeled
and
came
back
by
great
swoops
by
long
slow
aerial
leaps
of
surprising
altitude
in
the
street
there
was
dead
silence
many
people
were
looking
but
nobody
spoke
i
wondered
what
they
thought
of
my
feat
and
what
they
would
say
if
they
knew
how
easily
the
thing
was
done
by
the
merest
chance
i
had
found
out
how
to
do
it
and
the
only
reason
why
it
seemed
a
feat
was
that
no
one
else
had
ever
attempted
it
instinctively
i
felt
that
to
say
anything
about
the
accident
which
had
led
to
the
discovery
would
be
imprudent
then
the
real
meaning
of
the
strange
hush
in
the
street
began
to
dawn
upon
me
i
said
to
myself
this
silence
is
the
silence
of
dreams
i
am
quite
well
aware
that
this
is
a
dream
i
remember
having
dreamed
the
same
dream
before
but
the
discovery
of
this
power
is
not
a
dream
is
a
revelation
now
that
i
have
learned
how
to
fly
i
can
no
more
forget
it
than
a
swimmer
can
forget
how
to
swim
morning
i
shall
astonish
the
people
by
sailing
over
the
roofs
of
the
town
morning
came
and
i
woke
with
the
fixed
resolve
to
fly
out
of
the
window
but
no
sooner
had
i
risen
from
bed
than
the
knowledge
of
physical
relations
returned
like
a
sensation
forgotten
and
compelled
me
to
recognize
the
unwelcome
truth
that
i
had
not
made
any
discovery
at
all
this
was
neither
the
first
nor
the
last
of
such
dreams
but
it
was
particularly
vivid
and
i
therefore
selected
it
for
narration
as
a
good
example
of
its
class
i
still
fly
occasionally
sometimes
over
fields
and
streams
sometimes
through
familiar
streets
and
the
dream
is
invariably
accompanied
by
remembrance
of
like
dreams
in
the
past
as
well
as
by
the
conviction
that
i
have
really
found
out
a
secret
really
acquired
a
new
faculty
this
time
at
all
events
i
say
to
myself
it
is
impossible
that
i
can
be
mistaken
i
that
i
shall
be
able
to
fly
after
i
awake
many
times
before
in
other
dreams
i
learned
the
secret
only
to
forget
it
on
awakening
but
this
time
i
am
absolutely
sure
that
i
shall
not
forget
and
the
conviction
actually
stays
with
me
until
i
rise
from
bed
when
the
physical
effort
at
once
reminds
me
of
the
formidable
reality
of
gravitation
the
oddest
part
of
this
experience
is
the
feeling
of
buoyancy
it
is
much
like
the
feeling
of
floating
of
rising
or
sinking
through
tepid
water
for
example
and
there
is
no
sense
of
real
effort
it
is
a
delight
yet
it
usually
leaves
something
to
be
desired
i
am
a
low
flyer
i
can
proceed
only
like
a
pteromys
or
a
and
far
less
quickly
moreover
i
must
tread
earth
occasionally
in
order
to
obtain
a
fresh
impulsion
i
seldom
rise
to
a
height
of
more
than
or
thirty
feet
the
greater
part
of
the
time
i
am
merely
skimming
surfaces
touching
the
ground
only
at
intervals
of
several
hundred
yards
is
pleasant
skimming
but
i
always
feel
in
a
faint
and
watery
way
the
dead
pull
of
the
world
beneath
me
now
the
experience
of
most
i
find
to
be
essentially
like
my
own
i
have
met
but
one
who
claims
superior
powers
he
says
that
he
flies
over
mountains
goes
sailing
from
peak
to
peak
like
a
kite
all
others
whom
i
have
questioned
acknowledge
that
they
fly
low
in
long
parabolic
curves
and
this
only
by
touching
ground
from
time
to
time
most
of
them
also
tell
me
that
their
flights
usually
begin
with
an
imagined
fall
or
desperate
leap
and
no
less
than
four
say
that
the
start
is
commonly
taken
from
the
top
of
a
stairway
decoration
for
myriads
of
years
humanity
has
thus
been
flying
by
night
how
did
the
fancied
motion
having
so
little
in
common
with
any
experience
of
active
life
become
a
universal
experience
of
the
life
of
sleep
it
may
be
that
of
certain
kinds
of
aerial
motion
exultant
experiences
of
leaping
or
swinging
for
example
are
in
so
magnified
and
prolonged
as
to
create
the
illusion
of
flight
we
know
that
in
actual
time
the
duration
of
most
dreams
is
very
brief
but
in
the
of
sleep
nightmare
offering
some
startling
exceptions
there
is
scarcely
more
than
a
faint
smouldering
of
consciousness
by
comparison
with
the
quick
flash
and
vivid
thrill
of
active
cerebration
and
time
to
the
dreaming
brain
would
seem
to
be
magnified
somewhat
as
it
must
be
relatively
magnified
to
the
feeble
consciousness
of
an
insect
supposing
that
any
memory
of
the
sensation
of
falling
together
with
the
memory
of
the
concomitant
fear
should
be
accidentally
revived
in
sleep
the
of
the
sensation
and
the
emotion
unchecked
by
the
natural
sequence
of
shock
might
suffice
to
revive
other
and
even
pleasurable
memories
of
airy
motion
and
these
again
might
quicken
other
combinations
of
interrelated
memories
able
to
furnish
all
the
incident
and
scenery
of
the
long
phantasmagoria
but
this
hypothesis
will
not
fully
explain
certain
feelings
and
ideas
of
a
character
different
from
any
experience
of
the
exultation
of
voluntary
motion
without
exertion
the
pleasure
of
the
utterly
impossible
the
ghostly
delight
of
imponderability
neither
can
it
serve
to
explain
other
of
levitation
which
do
not
begin
with
the
sensation
of
leaping
or
falling
and
are
seldom
of
a
pleasurable
kind
for
example
it
sometimes
happens
during
nightmare
that
the
dreamer
deprived
of
all
power
to
move
or
speak
actually
feels
his
body
lifted
into
the
air
and
floated
away
by
the
force
of
the
horror
within
him
again
there
are
dreams
in
which
the
dreamer
has
no
physical
being
i
have
thus
found
myself
without
any
body
a
viewless
and
voiceless
phantom
hovering
upon
a
in
twilight
time
and
trying
to
frighten
lonely
folk
by
making
small
moaning
noises
the
sensation
was
of
moving
through
the
air
by
mere
act
of
will
there
was
no
touching
of
surfaces
and
i
seemed
to
glide
always
about
a
foot
above
the
road
could
the
feeling
of
be
partly
interpreted
by
organic
memory
of
conditions
of
life
more
ancient
than
man
life
weighty
and
winged
and
flying
heavily
little
above
the
ground
or
might
we
suppose
that
some
dormant
in
other
time
wakens
within
the
brain
at
rare
moments
of
our
the
limited
human
consciousness
has
been
beautifully
compared
to
the
visible
solar
spectrum
above
and
below
which
whole
zones
of
colors
invisible
await
the
evolution
of
superior
senses
and
mystics
aver
that
something
of
the
or
rays
of
the
vaster
mind
may
be
momentarily
glimpsed
in
dreams
certainly
the
cosmic
life
in
each
of
us
has
been
all
things
in
all
forms
of
space
and
time
perhaps
you
would
like
to
believe
that
it
may
bestir
in
slumber
some
vague
of
things
more
ancient
than
the
sun
memory
of
vanished
planets
with
fainter
powers
of
gravitation
where
the
normal
modes
of
voluntary
motion
would
have
been
like
the
realization
of
our
flying
dreams
decoration
i
what
the
fear
of
ghosts
among
those
who
believe
in
ghosts
all
fear
is
the
result
of
experience
experience
of
the
individual
or
of
the
race
experience
either
of
the
present
life
or
of
lives
forgotten
even
the
fear
of
the
unknown
can
have
no
other
origin
and
the
fear
of
ghosts
must
be
a
product
of
past
pain
probably
the
fear
of
ghosts
as
well
as
the
belief
in
them
had
its
beginning
in
dreams
it
is
a
peculiar
fear
no
other
fear
is
so
intense
yet
none
is
so
vague
feelings
thus
voluminous
and
dim
are
mostly
feelings
inherited
feelings
made
within
us
by
the
experience
of
the
dead
what
experience
nowhere
do
i
remember
reading
a
plain
statement
of
the
reason
why
ghosts
are
feared
ask
any
ten
intelligent
persons
of
your
acquaintance
who
remember
having
once
been
afraid
of
ghosts
to
tell
you
exactly
why
they
were
afraid
to
define
the
fancy
behind
the
fear
and
i
doubt
whether
even
one
will
be
able
to
answer
the
question
the
literature
of
oral
and
written
throws
no
clear
light
upon
the
subject
we
find
indeed
various
legends
of
men
torn
asunder
by
phantoms
but
such
gross
imaginings
could
not
explain
the
peculiar
quality
of
ghostly
fear
it
is
not
a
fear
of
bodily
violence
it
is
not
even
a
reasoning
fear
not
a
fear
that
can
readily
explain
itself
which
would
not
be
the
case
if
it
were
founded
upon
definite
ideas
of
physical
danger
furthermore
although
primitive
ghosts
may
have
been
imagined
as
capable
of
tearing
and
devouring
the
common
idea
of
a
ghost
is
certainly
that
of
a
being
intangible
and
imponderable
i
may
remark
here
that
in
many
old
japanese
legends
and
ballads
ghosts
are
represented
as
having
power
to
people
heads
but
so
far
as
the
origin
of
the
fear
of
ghosts
is
concerned
such
stories
explain
nothing
since
the
experiences
that
evolved
the
fear
must
have
been
real
not
imaginary
experiences
now
i
venture
to
state
boldly
that
the
common
fear
of
ghosts
is
fear
of
being
touched
by
or
in
other
words
that
the
imagined
supernatural
is
dreaded
mainly
because
of
its
imagined
power
to
touch
only
to
remember
not
to
wound
or
to
kill
but
this
dread
of
the
touch
would
itself
be
the
result
of
experience
chiefly
i
think
of
prenatal
experience
stored
up
in
the
individual
by
inheritance
like
the
child
fear
of
darkness
and
who
can
ever
have
had
the
sensation
of
being
touched
by
ghosts
the
answer
is
simple
who
has
been
seized
by
phantoms
in
a
elements
of
primeval
fears
fears
older
than
humanity
doubtless
enter
into
the
of
darkness
but
the
more
definite
fear
of
ghosts
may
very
possibly
be
composed
with
inherited
results
of
ancestral
experience
of
nightmare
and
the
intuitive
terror
of
supernatural
touch
can
thus
be
evolutionally
explained
let
me
now
try
to
illustrate
my
theory
by
relating
some
typical
experiences
ii
when
about
five
years
old
i
was
condemned
to
sleep
by
myself
in
a
certain
isolated
room
thereafter
always
called
the
child
room
at
that
time
i
was
scarcely
ever
mentioned
by
name
but
only
referred
to
as
the
child
the
room
was
narrow
but
very
high
and
in
spite
of
one
tall
window
very
gloomy
it
contained
a
wherein
no
fire
was
ever
kindled
and
the
child
suspected
that
the
chimney
was
haunted
a
law
was
made
that
no
light
should
be
left
in
the
child
room
at
night
simply
because
the
child
was
afraid
of
the
dark
his
fear
of
the
dark
was
judged
to
be
a
mental
disorder
requiring
severe
treatment
but
the
treatment
aggravated
the
disorder
previously
i
had
been
accustomed
to
sleep
in
a
room
with
a
nurse
to
take
care
of
me
i
thought
that
i
should
die
of
fright
when
sentenced
to
lie
alone
in
the
dark
and
what
seemed
to
me
then
abominably
cruel
actually
into
my
room
the
most
dismal
room
of
the
house
night
after
night
when
i
had
been
warmly
tucked
into
bed
the
lamp
was
removed
the
key
clicked
in
the
lock
the
protecting
light
and
the
footsteps
of
my
guardian
receded
together
then
an
agony
of
fear
would
come
upon
me
something
in
the
black
air
would
seem
to
gather
and
grow
i
thought
that
i
could
even
it
grow
till
i
had
to
scream
screaming
regularly
brought
punishment
but
it
also
brought
back
the
light
which
more
than
consoled
for
the
punishment
this
fact
being
at
last
found
out
orders
were
given
to
pay
no
further
heed
to
the
screams
of
the
child
why
was
i
thus
insanely
afraid
partly
because
the
dark
had
always
been
peopled
for
me
with
shapes
of
terror
so
far
back
as
memory
extended
i
had
suffered
from
ugly
dreams
and
when
aroused
from
them
i
could
always
the
forms
dreamed
of
lurking
in
the
shadows
of
the
room
they
would
soon
fade
out
but
for
several
moments
they
would
appear
like
tangible
realities
and
they
were
always
the
same
figures
sometimes
without
any
preface
of
dreams
i
used
to
see
them
at
following
me
about
from
room
to
room
or
reaching
long
dim
hands
after
me
from
story
to
story
up
through
the
interspaces
of
the
deep
stairways
i
had
complained
of
these
haunters
only
to
be
told
that
i
must
never
speak
of
them
and
that
they
did
not
exist
i
had
complained
to
everybody
in
the
house
and
everybody
in
the
house
had
told
me
the
very
same
thing
but
there
was
the
evidence
of
my
eyes
the
denial
of
that
evidence
i
could
explain
only
in
two
ways
either
the
shapes
were
afraid
of
big
people
and
showed
themselves
to
me
alone
because
i
was
little
and
weak
or
else
the
entire
household
had
agreed
for
some
ghastly
reason
to
say
what
was
not
true
this
latter
theory
seemed
to
me
the
more
probable
one
because
i
had
several
times
perceived
the
shapes
when
i
was
not
unattended
and
the
consequent
appearance
of
secrecy
frightened
me
scarcely
less
than
the
visions
did
why
was
i
forbidden
to
talk
about
what
i
saw
and
even
heard
on
creaking
stairways
behind
wavering
curtains
nothing
will
hurt
you
this
was
the
merciless
answer
to
all
my
pleadings
not
to
be
left
alone
at
night
but
the
haunters
hurt
me
only
they
would
wait
until
after
i
had
fallen
asleep
and
so
into
their
power
for
they
possessed
occult
means
of
preventing
me
from
rising
or
moving
or
crying
out
needless
to
comment
upon
the
policy
of
locking
me
up
alone
with
these
fears
in
a
black
room
unutterably
was
i
tormented
in
that
room
for
years
therefore
i
felt
relatively
happy
when
sent
away
at
last
to
a
children
where
the
haunters
very
seldom
ventured
to
show
themselves
they
were
not
like
any
people
that
i
had
ever
known
they
were
shadowy
figures
capable
of
atrocious
capable
for
instance
of
growing
up
to
the
ceiling
and
then
across
it
and
then
lengthening
themselves
along
the
opposite
wall
only
their
faces
were
distinct
and
i
tried
not
to
look
at
their
faces
i
tried
also
in
my
dreams
or
thought
that
i
tried
to
awaken
myself
from
the
sight
of
them
by
pulling
at
my
eyelids
with
my
fingers
but
the
eyelids
would
remain
closed
as
if
sealed
many
years
afterwards
the
frightful
plates
in
orfila
des
beheld
for
the
first
time
recalled
to
me
with
a
sickening
start
the
of
childhood
but
to
understand
the
child
experience
you
must
imagine
orfila
drawings
intensely
alive
and
continually
elongating
or
distorting
as
in
some
monstrous
anamorphosis
nevertheless
the
mere
sight
of
those
was
not
the
worst
of
the
experiences
in
the
child
room
the
dreams
always
began
with
a
suspicion
or
sensation
of
something
heavy
in
the
air
slowly
quenching
will
slowly
numbing
my
power
to
move
at
such
times
i
usually
found
myself
alone
in
a
large
unlighted
apartment
and
almost
simultaneously
with
the
first
sensation
of
fear
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
would
become
suffused
to
the
ceiling
with
a
glow
making
objects
dimly
visible
though
the
ceiling
itself
remained
this
was
not
a
true
appearance
of
light
rather
it
seemed
as
if
the
black
air
were
changing
color
from
beneath
certain
terrible
aspects
of
sunset
on
the
eve
of
storm
offer
like
effects
of
sinister
color
forthwith
i
would
try
to
escape
feeling
at
every
step
a
sensation
of
and
would
sometimes
succeed
in
struggling
across
the
room
but
there
i
would
always
find
myself
brought
to
a
standstill
paralyzed
by
some
innominable
opposition
happy
voices
i
could
hear
in
the
next
room
i
could
see
light
through
the
transom
over
the
door
that
i
had
vainly
endeavored
to
reach
i
knew
that
one
loud
cry
would
save
me
but
not
even
by
the
most
frantic
effort
could
i
raise
my
voice
above
a
whisper
and
all
this
signified
only
that
the
nameless
was
coming
was
nearing
was
mounting
the
stairs
i
could
hear
the
step
booming
like
the
sound
of
a
muffled
drum
and
i
wondered
why
nobody
else
heard
it
a
long
long
time
the
haunter
would
take
to
come
malevolently
pausing
after
each
ghastly
footfall
then
without
a
creak
the
bolted
door
would
open
slowly
slowly
and
the
thing
would
enter
gibbering
soundlessly
and
put
out
hands
and
clutch
me
and
toss
me
to
the
black
ceiling
and
catch
me
descending
to
toss
me
up
again
and
again
and
again
in
those
moments
the
feeling
was
not
fear
fear
itself
had
been
torpified
by
the
first
seizure
it
was
a
sensation
that
has
no
name
in
the
language
of
the
living
for
every
touch
brought
a
shock
of
something
infinitely
worse
than
pain
something
that
thrilled
into
the
innermost
secret
being
of
me
a
sort
of
abominable
electricity
discovering
unimagined
capacities
of
suffering
in
totally
unfamiliar
regions
of
sentiency
this
was
commonly
the
work
of
a
single
tormentor
but
i
can
also
remember
having
been
caught
by
a
group
and
tossed
from
one
to
another
seemingly
for
a
time
of
many
minutes
iii
whence
the
fancy
of
those
shapes
i
do
not
know
possibly
from
some
impression
of
fear
in
earliest
infancy
possibly
from
some
experience
of
fear
in
other
lives
than
mine
that
mystery
is
forever
insoluble
but
the
mystery
of
the
shock
of
the
touch
admits
of
a
definite
hypothesis
first
allow
me
to
observe
that
the
experience
of
the
sensation
itself
can
not
be
dismissed
as
mere
imagination
imagination
means
cerebral
activity
its
pains
and
its
pleasures
are
alike
inseparable
from
nervous
operation
and
their
physical
importance
is
sufficiently
proved
by
their
physiological
effects
may
kill
as
well
as
other
fear
and
no
emotion
thus
powerful
can
be
reasonably
deemed
undeserving
of
study
one
remarkable
fact
in
the
problem
to
be
considered
is
that
the
sensation
of
seizure
in
dreams
differs
totally
from
all
sensations
familiar
to
ordinary
waking
life
why
this
differentiation
how
interpret
the
extraordinary
massiveness
and
depth
of
the
thrill
i
have
already
suggested
that
the
dreamer
fear
is
most
probably
not
a
reflection
of
relative
experience
but
represents
the
incalculable
total
of
ancestral
experience
of
if
the
sum
of
the
experience
of
active
life
be
transmitted
by
inheritance
so
must
likewise
be
transmitted
the
summed
experience
of
the
life
of
sleep
and
in
normal
heredity
either
class
of
transmissions
would
probably
remain
distinct
now
granting
this
hypothesis
the
sensation
of
would
have
had
its
beginnings
in
the
earliest
phases
of
long
prior
to
the
apparition
of
man
the
first
creatures
capable
of
thought
and
fear
must
often
have
dreamed
of
being
caught
by
their
natural
enemies
there
could
not
have
been
much
imagining
of
pain
in
these
primal
dreams
but
higher
nervous
development
in
later
forms
of
being
would
have
been
accompanied
with
larger
susceptibility
to
still
later
with
the
growth
of
ideas
of
the
supernatural
would
have
changed
and
intensified
the
character
of
furthermore
through
all
the
course
of
evolution
heredity
would
have
been
accumulating
the
experience
of
such
feeling
under
those
forms
of
imaginative
pain
evolved
through
reaction
of
religious
beliefs
there
would
persist
some
dim
survival
of
savage
primitive
fears
and
again
under
this
a
dimmer
but
incomparably
deeper
substratum
of
ancient
in
the
dreams
of
the
modern
child
all
these
latencies
might
quicken
one
below
another
unfathomably
with
the
coming
and
the
growing
of
nightmare
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
phantasms
of
any
particular
nightmare
have
a
history
older
than
the
brain
in
which
they
move
but
the
shock
of
the
touch
would
seem
to
indicate
point
of
with
the
total
of
shadowy
it
may
be
that
profundities
of
self
abysses
never
reached
by
any
ray
from
the
life
of
sun
are
strangely
stirred
in
slumber
and
that
out
of
their
blackness
immediately
responds
a
shuddering
of
memory
measureless
even
by
millions
of
years
readings
from
a
decoration
often
in
the
blind
dead
of
the
night
i
find
myself
reading
a
book
a
big
broad
book
a
by
i
do
not
mean
a
book
about
dreams
but
a
book
made
of
the
stuff
that
dreams
are
made
of
i
do
not
know
the
name
of
the
book
nor
the
name
of
its
author
i
have
not
been
able
to
see
the
and
there
is
no
running
title
as
for
the
back
of
the
volume
it
remains
like
the
back
of
the
moon
invisible
forever
at
no
time
have
i
touched
the
book
in
any
way
not
even
to
turn
a
leaf
somebody
always
viewless
holds
it
up
and
open
before
me
in
the
dark
and
i
can
read
it
only
because
it
is
lighted
by
a
light
that
comes
from
nowhere
above
and
beneath
and
on
either
side
of
the
book
there
is
darkness
absolute
but
the
pages
seem
to
retain
the
yellow
glow
of
lamps
that
once
illuminated
them
a
queer
fact
is
that
i
never
see
the
entire
text
of
a
page
at
once
though
i
see
the
whole
page
itself
plainly
the
text
rises
or
seems
to
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
paper
as
i
gaze
and
fades
out
almost
immediately
after
having
been
read
by
a
simple
effort
of
will
i
can
recall
the
vanished
sentences
to
the
page
but
they
do
not
come
back
in
the
same
form
as
before
they
seem
to
have
been
oddly
revised
during
the
interval
never
can
i
coax
even
one
fugitive
line
to
reproduce
itself
exactly
as
it
read
at
first
but
i
can
always
force
something
to
return
and
this
something
remains
sharply
distinct
during
perusal
then
it
turns
faint
grey
and
appears
to
sink
as
through
thick
milk
backward
out
of
sight
by
regularly
taking
care
to
write
down
immediately
upon
awakening
whatever
i
could
remember
reading
in
the
i
found
myself
able
last
year
to
reproduce
portions
of
the
text
but
the
order
in
which
i
now
present
these
fragments
is
not
at
all
the
order
in
which
i
recovered
them
if
they
seem
to
have
any
interconnection
this
is
only
because
i
tried
to
arrange
them
in
what
i
imagined
to
be
the
rational
sequence
of
their
original
place
and
relation
i
know
scarcely
anything
and
even
regarding
the
character
of
the
book
itself
i
have
been
able
to
discover
only
that
a
great
part
of
it
consists
of
dialogues
about
the
unthinkable
fr
i
then
the
wave
prayed
to
remain
a
wave
forever
the
sea
made
answer
nay
thou
must
break
there
is
no
rest
in
me
billions
of
billions
of
times
thou
wilt
rise
again
to
break
and
break
to
rise
again
the
wave
complained
i
fear
thou
sayest
that
i
shall
rise
again
but
when
did
ever
a
wave
return
from
the
place
of
breaking
the
sea
responded
times
countless
beyond
utterance
thou
hast
broken
and
yet
thou
art
behold
the
myriads
of
the
waves
that
run
before
thee
and
the
myriads
that
pursue
behind
thee
all
have
been
to
the
place
of
breaking
times
unspeakable
and
thither
they
hasten
now
to
break
again
into
me
they
melt
only
to
swell
anew
but
pass
they
must
for
there
is
not
any
rest
in
me
murmuring
the
wave
replied
shall
i
not
be
scattered
presently
to
mix
with
the
mingling
of
all
these
myriads
how
should
i
rise
again
never
never
again
can
i
become
the
same
the
same
thou
never
art
returned
the
sea
at
any
two
moments
in
thy
running
perpetual
change

the
law
of
thy
being
what
is
thine
always
thou
art
shaped
with
the
substance
of
waves
forgotten
waves
numberless
beyond
the
sands
of
the
shores
of
me
in
thy
multiplicity

art

a
phantom

impermanency

the
wave
and
fear
and
hope
and
the
joy
of
the
light
whence
and
what
are
these
if
i
be
not
real
thou
hast
no
pain
the
sea
responded
nor
fear
nor

nor
joy
thou

nothing

in
me

am
thy
self
thine

there
is
no
rest
in

thou
wilt
break
only
to
rise
again
for
death

the
rhythm
of
life
lo
i
too
die
that
i
may
live

my
waters
have
passed
and
will
pass
again
with
wrecks
of
innumerable
worlds
to
the
burning
of
innumerable
suns

too
am

unspeakably
dead
tides
of
millions
of
oceans

thee
to
learn

only
because
thou
wast

wilt
become
again

i
can
not
understand
answered
the
sea
thy
part
is
to
pulse
and
pass
never
to
understand

also
even
i
the
great
sea

not

the
stones
and
the
rocks

felt

winds

been
breath
and

the
rivers

oceans
of

been
locked
into
chambers
of
hearts

the
palingenesis
can
not
cease
till
every
cosmic
particle
shall
have
passed
through
the
uttermost
possible
experience
of
the
highest
possible
life

what
of
the
planetary
core
has
that
too
felt
and
thought
even
so
surely
as
that
all
flesh
has
been
in
the
ceaseless
succession
of
integrations
and
dissolutions

shifted

no
regret
is
vain
it
is
sorrow
that
spins
the
thread
softer
than
moonshine
thinner
than
fragrance
stronger
than
death
the
of
the
greater
memory
in
millions
of
years

will
meet
again

not

you
will
not
be
all
of
your
present
self
nor
she
be
all

she
has

at
once
be
less
and
yet
incomparably
more

the
longing
that
must
come
upon
you

itself
will
seem

a
barrier
through
which
you
would
leap
to
her

it
may
be

have
shifted
numberless
times
ere
then
neither
will
remember
but
each
will
be
filled
with
a
feeling
immeasurable
of
having
met
before

wronging
the
being
who
loves
the
being
blindly
imagined
but
of
yesterday
this
mocker
mocks
the
divine
in
the
past
of
the
soul
of
the
world
then
in
that
heart
is
revived
the
countless
million
sorrows
buried
in
forgotten
graves
all
the
old
pain
of
love
in
its
patient
contest
with
hate
since
the
beginning

the
man
said
to
the
multitude
remaining
of
his
souls
i
am
weary
of
life
and
the
remnant
replied
to
him
we
also
are
weary
of
the
shame
and
pain
of
dwelling
in
so
vile
a
habitation
continually
we
strive
that
the
beams
may
break
and
the
pillars
crack
and
the
roof
fall
in
upon
us
surely
there
is
a
curse
upon
me
groaned
the
man
there
is
no
justice
in
the
gods
then
the
souls
tumultuously
laughed
in
scorn
even
as
the
leaves
of
a
wood
in
the
wind
do
chuckle
all
together
and
they
made
answer
to
him
as
a
fool
thou
liest
did
any
save
thyself
make
thy
vile
body
was
it
shapen
or
misshapen
by
any
deeds
or
thoughts
except
thine
own
no
deed
or

can
i

returned
the
man
deserving
that
which
has
come
upon
me
remember
laughed
the
souls
no
the
folly
was
in
other
lives
but
we
remember
and
remembering
we
hate
ye
are
all
one
with
me
cried
the
man
how
can
ye
hate
one
with
thee
mocked
the
souls
as
the
wearer
is
one
with
his
garment
how
can
we
hate
as
the
fire
that
devours
the
wood
from
which
it
is
drawn
by
the
even
so
we
can
hate
it
is
a
cursed
world
cried
the
man
why
did
ye
not
guide
me
the
souls
replied
to
him
thou
wouldst
not
heed
the
guiding
of
ghosts
that
were
wiser
than
we
cowards
and
weaklings
curse
the
world
the

do
not
blame
the

it
gives
them
all
that
they
desire
by
power
they
break
and
take
and
keep
life
for
them
is
a
joy
a
triumph
an
exultation
but
creatures
without
power
merit
nothing
and
nothingness
becomes
their
portion
thou
and
we
shall
presently
enter
into
nothingness
do
ye
fear
asked
the
man
there
is
reason
for
fear
the
souls
answered
yet
no
one
of
us
would
wish
to
delay
the
time
of
what
we
fear
by
continuing
to
make
part
of
such
an
existence
as
thine
but
ye
have
died
innumerable
times
wonderingly
said
the
man
no
we
have
not
said
the
souls
not
even
once
that
we
can
remember
and
our
memory
reaches
back
to
the
beginnings
of
this
world
we
die
only
with
the
race
the
man
said
nothing
being
afraid
the
souls
resumed
thy
race
ceases
its
continuance
depended
upon
thy
power
to
serve
our
purposes
thou
hast
lost
all
power
what
art
thou
but
a
a
freedom
we
needed
and
space
here
we
have
been
compacted
together
a
billion
to
a
doorless
our
chambers
and
blind
and
the
passages
are
blocked
and
broken
and
the
stairways
lead
to
nothing
also
there
are
haunters
here
not
of
our
kind
things
never
to
be
named
for
a
little
time
the
man
thought
gratefully
of
death
and
dust
but
suddenly
there
came
into
his
memory
a
vision
of
his
enemy
face
with
a
wicked
smile
upon
it
and
then
he
wished
for
longer
life
a
hundred
years
of
life
and
pain
only
to
see
the
grass
grow
tall
above
the
grave
of
that
enemy
and
the
souls
mocked
his
desire
thine
enemy
will
not
waste
much
thought
upon
thee
he
is
no
thine
enemy
the
ghosts
in
that
body
have
room
and
great
light
high
are
the
ceilings
of
their
habitation
wide
and
clear
the
passageways
luminous
the
courts
and
pure
like
a
fortress
excellently
garrisoned
is
the
brain
of
thine
enemy
and
to
any
point
thereof
the
defending
hosts
can
be
gathered
for
battle
in
a
moment
together
generation
will
not
cease
nay
that
face
of
his
will
multiply
throughout
the
centuries
because
thine
enemy
in
every
time
provided
for
the
needs
of
his
higher
ghosts
he
gave
heed
to
their
warnings
he
pleasured
them
in
all
just
ways
he
did
not
fail
in
reverence
to
them
wherefore
they
now
have
power
to
help
him
at
his
need
how
hast
thou
reverenced
or
pleasured
us
the
man
remained
silent
for
a
space
then
as
in
horror
of
doubting
he
questioned
wherefore
should
ye
fear
if
nothingness
be
the
end
what
is
nothingness
the
souls
responded
only
in
the
language
of
delusion
is
there
an
end
that
which
thou
callest
the
end
is
in
truth
but
the
very
beginning
the
essence
of
us
can
not
cease
in
the
burning
of
worlds
it
can
not
be
consumed
it
will
shudder
in
the
cores
of
great
stars
it
will
quiver
in
the
light
of
other
suns
and
once
more
in
some
future
cosmos
it
will
reconquer
knowledge
but
only
after
evolutions
unthinkable
for
multitude
even
out
of
the
nameless
beginnings
of
form
and
thence
through
every
cycle
of
vanished
being
through
all
successions
of
exhausted
pain
through
all
the
abyss
of
the
past
it
must
climb
again
the
man
uttered
no
word
the
souls
spoke
on
for
millions
of
millions
of
ages
must
we
shiver
in
tempests
of
fire
then
shall
we
enter
anew
into
some
slime
primordial
there
to
quicken
and
again
writhe
upward
through
all
foul
dumb
blind
shapes
innumerable
the
metamorphoses
immeasurable
the
agonies
and
the
fault
is
not
of
any
gods
it
is
thine
good
or
evil
muttered
the
man
what
signifies
either
the
best
must
become
as
the
worst
in
the
grind
of
the
endless
change
nay
cried
out
the
souls
for
the
strong
there
is
a
goal
the
goal
that
thou
couldst
not
strive
to
gain
they
will
help
to
the
fashioning
of
fairer
worlds
they
will
win
to
larger
light
they
will
tower
and
soar
as
flame
to
enter
the
zones
of
the
divine
but
thou
and
we
go
back
to
slime
think
of
the
billion
summers
that
might
have
been
for
us
think
of
the
joys
the
loves
the
triumphs
cast
away
the
dawns
of
the
knowledge
undreamed
the
glories
of
sense
unimagined
the
exultations
of
illimitable
power
think
think
o
fool
of
all
that
thou
hast
lost
then
the
souls
of
the
man
turned
themselves
into
worms
and
devoured
him
in
a
pair
of
eyes
decoration
there
is
one
adolescent
moment
never
to
be
forgotten
the
moment
when
the
boy
learns
that
this
world
contains
nothing
more
wonderful
than
a
certain
pair
of
eyes
at
first
the
surprise
of
the
discovery
leaves
him
breathless
instinctively
he
turns
away
his
gaze
that
vision
seemed
too
delicious
to
be
true
but
presently
he
ventures
to
look
again
fearing
with
a
new
fear
afraid
of
the
reality
afraid
also
of
being
observed
and
lo
his
doubt
dissolves
in
a
new
shock
of
ecstasy
those
eyes
are
even
more
wonderful
than
he
had
imagined
nay
they
become
more
and
yet
more
entrancing
every
successive
time
that
he
looks
at
them
surely
in
all
the
universe
there
can
not
be
another
such
pair
of
eyes
what
can
lend
them
such
enchantment
why
do
they
appear
divine
he
feels
that
he
must
ask
somebody
to
explain
must
propound
to
older
and
wiser
heads
the
riddle
of
his
new
emotions
then
he
makes
his
confession
with
a
faint
intuitive
fear
of
being
laughed
at
but
with
a
strange
fresh
sense
of
rapture
in
the
telling
laughed
at
he
is
tenderly
but
this
does
not
embarrass
him
nearly
so
much
as
the
fact
that
he
can
get
no
answer
to
his
question
to
the
simple
why
made
so
interesting
by
his
frank
surprise
and
his
timid
blushes
no
one
is
able
to
enlighten
him
but
all
can
sympathize
with
the
bewilderment
of
his
sudden
awakening
from
the
long
of
childhood
perhaps
that
why
never
can
be
fully
answered
but
the
mystery
that
prompted
it
constantly
tempts
one
to
theorize
and
theories
may
have
a
worth
independent
of
immediate
results
had
it
not
been
for
old
theories
concerning
the
unknowable
what
should
we
have
been
able
to
learn
about
the
knowable
was
it
not
while
in
pursuit
of
the
impossible
that
we
stumbled
upon
the
and
infinitely
marvellous
possible
why
indeed
should
a
pair
of
human
eyes
appear
for
a
time
to
us
so
beautiful
that
when
likening
their
radiance
to
splendor
of
diamond
or
amethyst
or
emerald
we
feel
the
comparison
a
blasphemy
why
should
we
find
them
deeper
than
the
sea
deeper
than
the
day
deep
even
as
the
night
of
space
with
its
scintillant
mist
of
suns
certainly
not
because
of
mere
wild
fancy
these
thoughts
these
feelings
must
spring
from
some
actual
perception
of
the
marvellous
some
veritable
revelation
of
the
unspeakable
there
is
in
very
truth
one
brief
hour
of
life
during
which
the
world
holds
for
us
nothing
so
wonderful
as
a
pair
of
eyes
and
then
while
looking
into
them
we
discover
a
thrill
of
awe
vibrating
through
our
delight
awe
made
by
a
something
rather
than
seen
a
latency
a
power
a
shadowing
of
depth
unfathomable
as
the
cosmic
ether
it
is
as
though
through
some
intense
and
sudden
stimulation
of
vital
being
we
had
obtained
for
one
supercelestial
moment
the
glimpse
of
a
reality
never
before
imagined
and
never
again
to
be
revealed
there
is
indeed
an
illusion
we
seem
to
view
the
divine
but
this
divine
itself
whereby
we
are
dazzled
and
duped
is
a
ghost
not
to
actuality
belongs
the
spell
not
to
anything
that
is
but
to
some
infinite
composite
phantom
of
what
has
been
wondrous
the
vision
but
wondrous
only
because
our
mortal
sight
then
pierces
beyond
the
surface
of
the
present
into
profundities
of
myriads
of
years
pierces
beyond
the
mask
of
life
into
the
enormous
night
of
death
for
a
moment
we
are
made
aware
of
a
beauty
and
a
mystery
and
a
depth
unutterable
then
the
veil
falls
again
forever
the
splendor
of
the
eyes
that
we
worship
belongs
to
them
only
as
brightness
to
the
it
is
a
reflex
from
beyond
the
shadow
of
the
now
a
of
vanished
suns
unknowingly
within
that
we
meet
the
gaze
of
eyes
more
countless
than
the
hosts
of
heaven
eyes
otherwhere
passed
into
darkness
and
dust
thus
and
only
thus
the
depth
of
that
gaze
is
the
depth
of
the
sea
of
death
and
birth
and
its
mystery
is
the
vision
watching
us
out
of
the
silent
vast
of
the
abyss
of
being
thus
and
only
thus
do
truth
and
illusion
mingle
in
the
magic
of
eyes
the
spectral
past
suffusing
with
charm
ineffable
the
apparition
of
the
present
and
the
sudden
splendor
in
the
soul
of
the
seer
