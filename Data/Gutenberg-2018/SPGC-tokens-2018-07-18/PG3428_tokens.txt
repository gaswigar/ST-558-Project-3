a

can

more
than
look
at
a
king
it
was
long
ago
in
the
days
when
men
sighed
when
they
fell
in
love
when
people
danced
by
candle
and
lamp
and
did
dance
too
instead
of
solemnly
gliding
about
in
that
mellow
time
so
long
ago
when
the
young
were
romantic
and
summer
was
roses
and
wine
old
carewe
brought
his
lovely
daughter
home
from
the
convent
to
wreck
the
hearts
of
the
youth
of
rouen
that
was
not
a
far
journey
only
an
afternoon

through

miss

harp
carefully
strapped
behind
the
great
lumbering
carriage
her
guitar
on
the
front
seat
under
a
mound
of
bouquets
and
oddly
shaped
little
bundles
farewell
gifts
of
her
comrades
and
the
good
sisters
in
her
left
hand
she
clutched
a
small
lace
handkerchief
with
which
she
now
and
then
touched
her
eyes
brimmed
with
the
parting
from
sister
cecilia
sister
mary
bazilede
the
old
stone
steps
and
all
the
girls
but
for
every
time
that
she
lifted
the
dainty
kerchief
to
brush
away
the
edge
of
a
tear
she
took
a
deep
breath
of
the
western
woodland
air
and
smiled
at
least
twice
for
the
years
of
strict
inclosure
within
walls
and
still
gardens
were
finished
and
done
with
and
at
last
the
world
flashed
and
danced
in
a
mystery
before
her
this
mystery
was
brilliant
to
the
because
it
contained
men
she
was
eager
to
behold
it
they
rumbled
into
town
after
sunset
in
the
fair
twilight
the
dogs
barking
before
them
and
everyone
would
have
been
surprised
to
know
that
tom
vanrevel
instead
of
crailey
gray
was
the
first
to
see
her
by
the
merest
accident
tom
was
strolling
near
the
carewe
place
at
the
time
and
when
the
carriage
swung
into
the
gates
with
rattle
and
clink
and
clouds
of
dust
at
the
finish
it
was
not
too
soon
lost
behind
the
shrubbery
and
trees
for
tom
to
catch
something
more
than
a
glimpse
of
a
gray
skirt
behind
a
mound
of
flowers
and
of
a
charming
face
with
parted
lips
and
dark
eyes
beneath
the
scuttle
of
an
enormous
bonnet
it
happened
perhaps
it
is
more
accurate
to
say
that
tom
thought
it
happened
that
she
was
just
clearing
away
her
veil
when
he
turned
to
look
she
blushed
suddenly
so
much
was
not
to
be
mistaken
and
the
eyes
that
met
his
were
remarkable
for
other
reasons
than
the
sheer
loveliness
of
them
in
that
even
in
the
one
flash
of
them
he
caught
they
meant
so
many
things
at
one
time
they
were
sparkling
yet
mournful
and
they
were
wistful
although
undeniably
lively
with
the
gayest
comprehension
of
the
recipient
of
their
glance
seeming
to
say
oh
it
you
young
man
is
it
and
they
were
shy
and
mysterious
with
youth
full
of
that
wonder
at
the
world
which
has
the
appearance
sometimes
of
wisdom
gathered
in
the
unknown
out
of
which
we
came
but
above
all
these
eyes
were
fully
conscious
of
tom
vanrevel
without
realizing
what
he
did
vanrevel
stopped
short
he
had
been
swinging
a
walkingstick
which
describing
a
brief
arc
remained
poised
in
its
descent
there
was
only
that
one
glance
between
them
and
the
carriage
disappeared
leaving
a
scent
of
spring
flowers
in
the
air
the
young
man
was
left
standing
on
the
wooden
pavement
in
the
midst
of
a
great
loneliness
yet
enveloped
in
the
afterglow
his
soul
roseate
his
being
quavering
his
expression
like
his
cane
instantaneously
arrested
with
such
promptitude
and
finish
was
he
disposed
of
that
had
miss
carewe
been
aware
of
his
name
and
the
condition
wrought
in
him
by
the
single
stroke
she
could
have
sought
only
the
terse
richard
of
england
for
a
like
executive
ability
off
with
his
head
so
much
for
vanrevel
she
had
lifted
a
slender
hand
to
the
fluttering
veil
a
hand
in
a
white
glove
with
a
small
lace
gauntlet
at
the
wrist
this
gesture
was
the
final
divinity
of
the
radiant
vision
which
remained
with
the
dazed
young
man
as
he
went
down
the
street
and
it
may
have
been
of
an
hour
later
when
the
background
of
the
picture
became
vivid
to
him
a
carefully
dressed
gentleman
with
heavy
brows
and
a
handsome
high
nose
who
sat
stiffly
upright
beside
the
girl
his
very
bright
eyes
quite
as
conscious
of
the
stricken
pedestrian
as
were
hers
vastly
different
however
in
this
that
they
glittered
nay
almost
bristled
with
hostility
while
every
polished
button
of
his
blue
coat
seemed
to
reflect
their
malignancy
and
to
dart
little
echoing
shafts
of
venom
at
vanrevel
tom
was
dismayed
by
the
acuteness
of
his
perception
that
a
man
who
does
not
speak
to
you
has
no
right
to
have
a
daughter
like
the
lady
in
the
carriage
and
the
moment
of
this
realization
occurring
as
he
sat
making
a
poor
pretence
to
eat
his
evening
meal
at
the
rouen
house
he
dropped
his
fork
rattling
upon
his
plate
and
leaned
back
staring
at
nothing
a
proceeding
of
which
his
william
cummings
the
editor
of
the
rouen
journal
was
too
busy
over
his
river
bass
to
take
note
have
you
heard
what
new
in
town
asked
cummings
presently
looking
up
no
said
tom
truthfully
for
he
had
seen
what
was
new
but
not
heard
it
old
carewe
brought
his
daughter
home
fanchon
bareaud
was
with
her
at
mary
until
last
year
and
fanchon
says
she
not
only
a
great
beauty
but
a
great
ah
rejoined
the
other
with
masterly
indifference
dare
say
dare
no
wonder
you
not
interested
said
cummings
cheerfully
returning
to
the
discussion
of
his
bass
the
old
villain
will
take
precious
good
care
you
do
come
near
vanrevel
already
possessed
a
profound
conviction
to
the
same
effect
robert
meilhac
carewe
was
known
not
only
as
the
wealthiest
citizen
of
rouen
but
also
as
its
heartiest
and
most
steadfast
hater
and
although
there
were
only
five
or
six
thousand
inhabitants
neither
was
a
small
distinction
for
rouen
was
ranked
in
those
easy
days
as
a
wealthy
town
even
as
it
was
called
an
old
town
proud
of
its
age
and
its
riches
and
bitter
in
its
politics
of
course
the
french
had
built
a
fort
there
soon
after
lasalle
last
voyage
and
as
crailey
gray
said
had
settled
the
place
and
had
then
been
settled
themselves
by
the
pioneer
militia
after
the
revolution
carolinians
and
virginians
had
come
by
way
of
tennessee
and
kentucky
while
the
adventurous
countrymen
from
connecticut
travelling
thither
to
sell
remained
to
buy
and
then
sell
when
the
country
was
in
its
teens
in
course
of
time
the
little
of
the
northwest
territory
had
grown
to
be
the
leading
centre
of
elegance
and
culture
in
the
ohio
valley
at
least
they
said
so
in
rouen
only
a
few
people
in
the
country
such
as
irving
of
tarrytown
for
instance
questioning
whether
a
centre
could
lead
the
pivotal
figure
though
perhaps
not
the
heart
of
this
centre
was
unquestionably
carewe
and
about
him
the
neat
and
tight
aristocracy
of
the
place
revolved
the
old
french
remnant
having
liberally
intermarried
forming
the
nucleus
together
with
descendants
of
the
cavaliers
and
those
who
said
they
were
and
the
industrious
yankees
by
virtue
if
not
by
the
virtues
of
all
whom
the
town
grew
and
prospered
robert
carewe
was
rouen
magnate
commercially
and
socially
and
until
an
upstart
young
lawyer
named
vanrevel
struck
into
his
power
with
a
politically
the
wharves
were
carewe
the
warehouses
that
stood
by
the
river
and
the
line
of
packets
which
plied
upon
it
were
his
half
the
town
was
his
and
in
rouen
this
meant
that
he
was
possessed
of
the
middle
justice
the
high
and
the
low
his
mother
was
a
frenchwoman
and
in
those
days
when
to
go
abroad
was
a
ponderous
and
venturesome
undertaking
the
fact
that
he
had
spent
most
of
his
youth
in
the
french
capital
wrought
a
certain
glamour
about
him
for
to
the
american
paris
was
europe
and
it
lay
shimmering
on
the
far
horizon
of
every
imagination
a
golden
city
scarce
a
in
rouen
lacked
its
fearsome
engraving
entitled
grand
ball
at
the
tuileries
nor
was
godey
magazine
ever
more
popular
than
when
it
contained
articles
elaborate
of
similar
scenes
of
festal
light
where
brilliant
uniforms
mingled
with
shining
jewels
fair
locks
and
the
white
shoulders
of
magnificently
dressed
duchesses
countesses
and
ladies
credit
for
this
description
should
be
given
entirely
to
the
periodical
furthermore
a
sojourn
in
paris
was
held
to
confer
a
certain
nameless
and
indescribable
polish
upon
the
manners
of
the
visitor
also
there
was
something
called
an
air
of
foreign
they
talked
a
great
deal
about
polish
in
those
days
and
some
examples
still
extant
do
not
deny
their
justification
but
in
the
case
of
carewe
there
existed
a
citizen
of
rouen
one
already
quoted
who
had
the
temerity
to
declare
the
polish
to
be
in
truth
quite
nameless
and
indescribable
for
the
reason
that
one
can
not
paint
a
vacuum
however
subscription
to
this
opinion
should
not
be
since
crailey
gray
had
been
notoriously
a
rival
of
carewe
with
every
pretty
woman
in
town
both
having
the
same
eye
in
such
matters
and
also
because
the
slandered
gentleman
could
assume
a
manner
when
he
chose
to
whether
or
not
he
possessed
it
at
his
own
table
he
exhaled
a
hospitable
graciousness
which
from
a
man
of
known
evil
temper
carried
the
winsomeness
of
surprise
when
he
wooed
it
was
with
an
air
of
stately
devotion
combined
with
that
knowingness
which
sometimes
offsets
for
a
widower
the
tendency
a
girl
has
to
giggle
at
him
and
the
combination
had
been
once
or
twice
too
much
for
even
the
alluring
crailey
carewe
lived
in
an
house
on
the
broad
quiet
shady
street
which
bore
his
name
there
was
a
wide
lawn
in
front
shadowy
under
elm
and
locust
trees
and
bounded
by
thick
shrubberies
a
long
garden
fair
with
roses
and
hollyhocks
lay
outside
the
library
windows
an
garden
with
fine
gravel
paths
and
green
arbors
drowsed
over
in
by
the
bees
while
overhead
the
locust
rasped
his
rusty
cadences
the
livelong
day
and
a
faraway
sounding
from
the
high
branches
brought
to
mind
the
line
like
an
old
refrain
the
voice
of
the
turtle
was
heard
in
the
between
the
garden
and
the
carriage
gates
there
was
a
fountain
where
a
bronze
boy
with
the
dropsy
but
not
minding
it
lived
in
a
perpetual
bath
from
a
green
goblet
held
over
his
head
nearby
a
stone
gleamed
against
a
clump
of
lilac
bushes
and
it
was
upon
this
spot
that
the
white
kitten
introduced
thomas
vanrevel
to
miss
carewe
upon
the
morning
after
her
arrival
having
finished
her
practice
touched
her
harp
twice
and
arpeggioed
the
spanish
fandango
on
her
guitar
miss
betty
read
two
paragraphs
of
gilbert
for
she
was
profoundly
determined
to
pursue
her
tasks
with
diligence
but
the
open
windows
disclosing
a
world
all
sunshine
and
green
leaves
she
threw
the
book
aside
with
a
good
conscience
and
danced
out
to
the
garden
there
coming
upon
a
fuzzy
white
ball
rolling
into
itself
spirally
on
a
lazy
pathway
she
pounced
at
it
whereupon
the
thing
uncurled
with
lightning
swiftness
and
fled
more
like
a
streak
than
a
kitten
down
the
drive
through
the
open
gates
and
into
the
street
miss
betty
in
full
cry
across
the
way
there
chanced
to
be
strolling
a
young
lady
in
blue
accompanied
by
a
gentleman
whose
leisurely
gait
gave
no
indication
of
the
maneuvering
he
had
done
to
hasten
their
walk
into
its
present
direction
he
was
apparently
thirty
or
tall
very
straight
dark
his
eyes
keen
and
thoughtful
and
his
high
white
hat
white
satin
cravat
and
careful
collar
were
evidence
of
an
elaboration
of
toilet
somewhat
unusual
in
rouen
for
the
morning
also
he
was
carrying
a
pair
of
white
gloves
in
his
hand
and
dangled
a
slender
ebony
cane
from
his
wrist
the
flying
kitten
headed
toward
the
couple
when
with
a
celerity
only
to
be
accounted
for
on
the
theory
that
his
eye
had
been
fixed
on
the
carewe
gateway
for
some
time
previous
to
this
sudden
apparition
the
gentleman
leaped
in
front
of
the
fugitive
the
kitten
attempted
a
dodge
to
pass
the
gentleman
was
there
before
it
the
kitten
feinted
the
gentleman
was
altogether
too
much
on
the
spot
immediately
and
just
as
miss
carewe
flushed
and
glowing
ran
into
the
street
the
small
animal
doubled
evaded
miss
betty
frantic
clutch
the
gateway
and
attempted
a
disappearance
into
the
lilac
bushes
instead
of
going
round
them
only
to
find
itself
for
a
fatal
two
seconds
in
difficulties
with
the
thicket
of
stems
in
regard
to
the
extraordinary
agility
of
which
the
pursuing
gentleman
as
capable
it
is
enough
to
say
that
he
caught
the
cat
he
emerged
from
the
lilacs
holding
it
in
one
hand
his
gloves
and
white
hat
in
the
other
and
presented
himself
before
miss
betty
with
a
breathlessness
not
entirely
attributable
to
his
exertions
for
a
moment
as
she
came
running
toward
him
and
he
met
her
flashing
look
bright
with
laughter
and
recognition
and
haste
he
stammered
a
thrill
nothing
less
than
delirious
sent
the
blood
up
behind
his
brown
cheeks
for
he
saw
that
she
too
knew
that
this
was
the
second
time
their
eyes
had
met
naturally
at
that
time
he
could
not
know
how
many
other
gentlemen
were
to
feel
that
same
thrill
in
their
cases
also
delirious
no
less
with
the
same
accompanying
mysterious
feeling
which
came
just
before
miss
betty
lashes
fell
that
one
had
found
at
last
a
precious
thing
lost
long
since
in
childhood
or
left
perhaps
upon
some
other
planet
in
a
life
ten
thousand
years
ago
he
could
not
speak
at
once
but
when
he
could
permit
me
madam
he
said
solemnly
offering
the
captive
to
restore
your
an
agitated
kitten
should
not
be
detained
by
clasping
its
waist
and
already
the
conqueror
was
paying
for
his
victory
there
ensued
a
final
outrageous
squirm
of
despair
two
frantic
claws
extended
drew
one
long
red
mark
across
the
stranger
wrist
and
another
down
the
back
of
his
hand
to
the
knuckles
they
were
good
hearty
scratches
and
the
blood
followed
the
artist
lines
rapidly
but
of
this
the
young
man
took
no
note
for
he
knew
that
he
was
about
to
hear
miss
carewe
voice
for
the
first
time
they
say
the
best
way
to
hold
them
he
observed
is
by
the
scruff
of
the
beholding
his
wounds
suffered
in
her
cause
she
gave
a
pitying
cry
that
made
his
heart
leap
with
the
richness
and
sweetness
of
it
catching
the
kitten
from
him
she
dropped
it
to
the
ground
in
such
wise
as
to
prove
nature
foresight
most
kind
in
cushioning
the
feet
of
cats
ah
i
did
want
it
that
much
a
cat
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
nightingales
in
the
bush
he
said
boldly
and
laughed
i
would
shed
more
blood
than
that
miss
betty
blushed
like
a
southern
dawn
and
started
back
from
him
from
the
convent
but
yesterday
and
she
had
taken
a
man
hand
in
both
of
hers
it
was
to
this
tableau
that
the
lady
in
blue
entered
following
the
hunt
through
the
gates
where
she
stopped
with
a
discomposed
countenance
at
once
however
she
advanced
and
with
a
cry
of
greeting
enveloped
miss
betty
in
a
brief
embrace
to
the
relief
of
the
latter
confusion
it
was
fanchon
bareaud
now
two
years
emancipated
from
mary
and
far
gone
in
taffeta
with
her
lustreful
light
hair
absent
blue
eyes
and
her
gentle
voice
as
small
and
pretty
as
her
face
and
figure
it
was
not
too
difficult
to
justify
crailey
gray
characterization
of
her
as
one
of
those
winsome
baggages
who
had
made
an
air
of
feminine
helplessness
the
fashion
of
the
day
it
is
a
wicked
thing
that
some
women
should
kiss
when
a
man
is
by
in
the
present
instance
the
gentleman
became
somewhat
faint
i
so
glad
glad
exclaimed
betty
you
were
just
coming
to
see
me
were
you
my
father
is
in
the
library
let
me
miss
bareaud
drew
back
no
no
she
interrupted
hastily
and
with
evident
perturbation
i
we
must
be
on
our
way
she
threw
a
glance
at
the
gentleman
which
let
him
know
that
she
now
comprehended
his
gloves
and
why
their
stroll
had
trended
toward
carewe
street
come
at
once
she
commanded
him
quickly
in
an
undertone
but
now
that
you
here
said
miss
betty
wondering
very
much
why
he
was
not
presented
to
her
wo
you
wait
and
let
me
gather
a
nosegay
for
you
our
pansies
and
violets
i
could
help
the
gentleman
suggested
with
the
look
of
a
lame
dog
at
miss
bareaud
i
have
been
considered
useful
about
a
fool
betty
did
not
hear
the
word
that
came
from
miss
bareaud
closed
teeth
though
she
was
mightily
surprised
at
the
visible
agitation
of
her
schoolmate
for
the
latter
face
was
pale
and
excited
and
miss
carewe
amazement
was
complete
when
fanchon
without
more
words
cavalierly
seized
the
gentleman
arm
and
moved
toward
the
street
with
him
as
rapidly
as
his
perceptible
reluctance
to
leave
permitted
but
at
the
gate
miss
bareaud
turned
and
called
back
over
her
shoulder
as
if
remembering
the
necessity
of
offering
an
excuse
for
so
remarkable
a
proceeding
i
shall
come
again
very
soon
just
now
we
are
upon
an
errand
of
great
importance
miss
betty
waved
her
hand
staring
after
them
her
eyes
large
with
wonder
she
compressed
her
lips
tightly
errand
this
was
the
friend
of
childhood
happy
hour
and
they
had
not
met
in
two
years
errand
she
ran
to
the
hedge
along
the
top
of
which
a
high
white
hat
was
now
seen
perambulating
she
pressed
down
a
loose
branch
and
called
in
a
tender
voice
to
the
stranger
whom
fanchon
had
chosen
should
remain
nameless
be
sure
to
put
some
salve
on
your
hand
he
made
a
bow
which
just
missed
being
too
low
but
did
miss
it
it
is
there
already
he
said
and
losing
his
courage
after
the
bow
made
his
speech
with
so
palpable
a
gasp
before
the
last
word
that
the
dullest
person
in
the
world
could
have
seen
that
he
meant
it
miss
betty
disappeared
there
was
a
rigidity
of
expression
about
the
gentle
mouth
of
fanchon
bareaud
which
her
companion
did
not
enjoy
as
they
went
on
their
way
each
preserving
an
uneasy
silence
until
at
her
own
door
she
turned
sharply
upon
him
tom
vanrevel
i
thought
you
were
the
steadiest
and
now
you
proved
yourself
the
craziest
soul
in
rouen
she
burst
out
and
i
could
say
worse
why
did
you
present
me
to
her
asked
vanrevel
because
i
thought
a
man
of
your
gallantry
might
prefer
not
to
face
a
shotgun
in
the
presence
of
ladies
pooh
pooh
mimicked
miss
bareaud
you
can
as
much
as
you
like
but
if
he
had
seen
us
from
the
window
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
for
a
moment
then
dropped
them
and
smiled
upon
him
i
understand
perfectly
to
what
i
owe
the
pleasure
of
a
stroll
with
you
this
morning
and
your
casual
insistence
on
the
shadiness
of
carewe
street
he
laughed
nervously
but
her
smile
vanished
and
she
continued
keep
away
tom
she
is
beautiful
and
at
mary
i
always
thought
she
had
spirit
and
wit
too
i
only
hope
crailey
wo
see
her
before
the
wedding
but
it
is
safe
for
you
go
along
now
and
ask
crailey
please
to
come
at
three
this
this
message
from
gray
betrothed
was
not
all
the
tom
conveyed
to
his
friend
vanrevel
was
ordinarily
esteemed
a
person
of
great
reserve
and
discretion
nevertheless
there
was
one
man
to
whom
he
told
everything
and
from
whom
he
had
no
secrets
he
spent
the
noon
hour
in
feeble
attempts
to
describe
to
crailey
gray
the
outward
appearance
of
miss
elizabeth
carewe
how
she
ran
like
a
young
diana
what
one
felt
upon
hearing
her
voice
and
he
presented
in
himself
an
example
exhibiting
something
of
the
cost
of
looking
in
her
eyes
his
conversation
was
more
or
less
incoherent
but
the
effect
of
it
was
complete
chapter
ii
surviving
evils
of
the
reign
of
terror
does
there
exist
an
incredulous
or
jealous
denizen
of
another
portion
of
our
country
who
knowing
that
the
room
in
the
wooden
cupola
over
carewe
library
was
commonly
alluded
to
by
rouen
as
the
tower
chamber
will
prove
himself
so
sectionally
prejudiced
as
to
deny
that
the
town
was
a
veritable
hotbed
of
literary
interest
or
that
sir
scott
was
there
some
of
the
men
looked
sly
and
others
grinned
at
mention
of
this
apartment
but
the
romantic
were
not
lacking
who
spoke
of
it
in
whispers
how
the
lights
sometimes
shone
there
all
night
long
and
the
gentlemen
drove
away
whitefaced
in
the
dawn
the
cupola
rising
above
the
library
overlooked
the
garden
and
the
house
save
for
that
was
of
a
single
story
with
a
low
veranda
running
the
length
of
its
front
the
windows
of
the
library
and
of
a
row
of
bedrooms
of
which
was
miss
betty
lined
the
veranda
steamboat
fashion
the
inner
doors
of
these
rooms
all
opening
upon
a
long
hail
which
bisected
the
house
the
stairway
leading
to
the
room
in
the
cupola
rose
the
library
itself
while
the
bisecting
hail
afforded
be
only
access
to
the
library
hence
the
gossips
acquainted
with
the
geography
of
the
place
conferred
seriously
together
upon
what
effect
miss
betty
homecoming
would
have
in
this
connection
dr
anyone
going
to
the
stairway
must
needs
pass
her
door
and
what
was
more
to
the
point
a
party
c
gentlemen
descending
late
from
the
mysterious
garret
might
be
not
so
quiet
as
they
intended
and
the
young
lady
sufficiently
disturbed
to
inquire
of
her
father
what
entertainment
he
provided
that
should
keep
his
guests
until
four
in
the
morning
but
at
present
it
was
with
the
opposite
end
of
the
house
that
the
town
was
occupied
for
there
workmen
were
hammering
and
sawing
and
painting
day
long
finishing
the
addition
carewe
was
building
for
his
daughter
debut
this
hammering
disturbed
miss
betty
who
had
become
almost
as
busy
with
the
french
revolution
as
with
her
for
she
had
found
in
her
father
library
many
books
not
for
and
she
had
become
a
girondin
she
found
memoirs
histories
and
tales
of
that
delectable
period
then
not
so
dim
with
time
but
that
the
figures
of
it
were
more
than
tragic
shadows
and
for
a
week
there
was
no
meal
in
that
house
to
which
she
sat
down
earlier
than
half
an
hour
jate
she
had
a
rightful
in
the
revolution
her
own
having
been
one
of
those
who
suffered
not
however
under
the
guillotine
for
to
georges
meilhac
appertained
the
rare
distinction
of
death
by
accident
on
the
day
when
the
young
bonaparte
played
upon
the
mob
with
his
cannon
there
were
some
yellow
letters
of
this
great
uncle
in
a
box
which
had
belonged
to
her
grandmother
a
rich
discovery
for
miss
betty
who
read
and
them
with
eager
and
excited
eyes
living
more
in
paris
with
georges
and
his
friends
than
in
rouen
with
her
father
indeed
she
had
little
else
to
do
carewe
was
no
comrade
for
her
by
far
the
reverse
she
seldom
saw
him
except
at
the
table
when
he
sat
with
averted
eyes
and
talked
to
her
very
little
and
while
making
elaborate
preparation
for
her
introduction
to
his
friends
such
was
his
phrase
he
treated
her
with
a
perfunctory
civility
which
made
her
wonder
if
her
advent
was
altogether
welcome
to
him
bat
when
she
noticed
that
his
hair
looked
darker
than
usual
about
every
fourth
day
she
began
to
understand
why
he
appeared
ungrateful
to
her
for
growing
up
he
went
out
a
great
deal
though
no
visitors
came
to
the
house
for
it
was
known
that
carewe
desired
to
present
his
daughter
to
no
one
until
he
presented
her
to
all
fanchon
bareaud
indeed
made
one
hurried
and
embarrassed
call
evading
miss
betty
reference
to
the
chevalier
of
the
kitten
with
a
dexterity
too
nimble
to
be
thought
unintentional
miss
carewe
was
forbidden
to
return
her
friend
visit
until
after
her
debut
and
carewe
explained
that
there
was
always
some
worthless
young
men
hanging
about
the
bareaud
where
he
did
not
add
they
interfered
with
a
worthy
oh
one
who
desired
to
honor
fanchon
older
sister
virginia
with
his
attentions
this
was
no
great
hardship
for
miss
betty
as
since
plunging
into
the
revolution
with
her
she
had
lost
some
curiosity
concerning
the
men
of
doubting
that
they
would
show
forth
as
heroic
as
debonnair
gay
and
tragic
as
he
he
was
the
legendary
hero
of
her
childhood
she
remembered
her
mother
stories
of
him
perhaps
more
clearly
than
she
remembered
her
mother
and
one
of
the
older
sisters
had
known
him
in
paris
and
had
talked
of
him
at
length
giving
the
flavor
of
his
dandyism
and
his
beauty
at
first
hand
to
his
young
relative
he
had
been
one
of
those
hardy
young
men
wearing
unbelievable
garments
who
began
to
appear
in
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
with
knives
in
their
sleeves
and
cudgels
in
their
hands
about
april
and
whose
dash
and
recklessness
in
many
matters
were
the
first
intimations
that
the
citizen
tallien
was
about
to
cause
the
citizen
robespierre
to
shoot
himself
through
the
jaw
in
the
library
hung
a
small
drawing
of
georges
done
in
color
by
miss
betty
grandmother
and
this
she
carried
to
her
own
room
an
studied
long
and
ardently
until
sometimes
the
man
himself
seemed
to
stand
before
her
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
mile
meithac
had
not
a
distinguished
talent
and
meilhac
features
might
have
been
anybody
it
was
to
be
seen
however
that
he
was
smiling
miss
betty
had
an
impression
that
her
grandmother
art
of
portraiture
would
have
been
with
the
profile
than
the
nevertheless
nothing
could
be
more
clearly
indicated
than
that
the
hair
of
melihac
was
very
yellow
and
his
short
waistcoat
white
striped
with
scarlet
an
enormous
cravat
covered
his
chin
the
heavy
collar
of
his
yellow
coat
rose
behind
his
ears
while
its
tails
fell
to
his
ankles
and
the
tight
trousers
of
white
and
yellow
stripes
were
tied
with
white
ribbons
about
the
middle
of
the
calf
he
wore
white
stockings
and
yellow
shoes
and
on
the
back
of
his
head
a
jauntily
cocked
black
hat
miss
betty
innocently
wondered
why
his
letters
did
not
speak
of
petion
of
vergniaud
or
of
dumoriez
since
in
the
historical
novels
which
she
read
the
hero
lot
was
inevitably
linked
with
that
of
everyone
of
importance
in
his
generation
yet
georges
appeared
to
have
been
unacquainted
with
these
personages
robespierre
being
the
only
name
of
consequence
mentioned
in
his
letters
and
then
it
appeared
in
much
the
same
fashion
practised
by
her
father
in
alluding
to
the
governor
of
the
state
who
had
the
misfortune
to
be
unpopular
with
carewe
but
this
did
not
dim
her
lustre
in
miss
betty
eyes
nor
lessen
for
her
the
pathetic
romance
of
the
smile
he
wore
beholding
this
smile
one
remembered
the
end
to
which
his
light
footsteps
bad
led
him
and
it
was
unavoidable
to
picture
him
left
lying
in
the
empty
street
behind
the
heels
of
the
flying
crowd
carefully
forming
that
same
smile
on
his
lips
and
taking
much
pride
in
passing
with
some
small
cynical
speech
murmured
to
himself
concerning
the
futility
of
a
gentleman
getting
shot
by
his
friends
for
merely
being
present
to
applaud
them
so
fancying
him
thus
with
his
yellow
hair
his
waistcoat
and
his
tragedy
the
young
girl
felt
a
share
of
family
greatness
or
at
least
of
picturesqueness
descend
to
her
and
she
smiled
sadly
back
upon
the
smile
in
the
picture
and
dreamed
about
its
original
night
after
night
whether
or
no
another
figure
that
of
a
dark
young
man
in
a
white
hat
with
a
white
kitten
etching
his
wrist
in
red
found
any
place
in
her
dreams
at
this
period
it
is
impossible
to
determine
she
did
not
see
him
again
it
is
quite
another
thing
hazardous
to
venture
to
state
that
he
did
not
see
her
at
all
events
it
is
certain
that
many
people
who
bad
never
beheld
her
were
talking
of
her
that
rouen
was
full
of
contention
concerning
her
beauty
and
her
gift
of
music
for
a
song
can
be
heard
through
an
open
window
and
how
did
it
happen
that
crailey
gray
knew
that
it
was
miss
carewe
habit
to
stroll
in
her
garden
for
half
an
hour
or
so
each
evening
before
retiring
and
that
she
went
to
mass
every
morning
soon
after
sunrise
crailey
gray
never
rose
at
or
near
sunrise
in
his
life
though
he
sometimes
beheld
it
from
another
point
of
view
as
the
end
of
the
evening
it
appears
that
someone
must
have
told
him
one
night
when
the
moon
lay
white
on
the
trees
and
housetops
miss
betty
paused
in
her
evening
promenade
and
seated
herself
upon
a
bench
on
the
borders
of
the
garden
touched
as
the
books
of
the
time
would
have
put
it
by
the
sweet
tranquillity
of
the
scene
and
wrought
upon
by
the
tender
incentive
to
sighs
and
melancholy
which
youth
in
loneliness
finds
in
a
loveliness
of
the
earth
the
breeze
bore
the
smells
of
the
garden
of
violets
and
cherry
blossoms
and
a
sound
of
distant
violins
came
on
the
air
playing
the
new
song
from
the
new
opera
but
i
also
dreamt
which
pleased
me
most
that
you
loved
me
just
the
same
they
sang
and
with
the
lilt
of
them
and
the
keen
beauty
of
the
night
the
inherited
pain
of
the
ages
rose
from
the
depths
of
the
young
heart
so
that
she
thought
it
must
break
for
what
reason
she
could
not
have
told
since
she
was
without
care
or
sorrow
that
she
knew
except
the
french
revolution
yet
tears
shone
upon
the
long
lashes
she
shook
them
off
and
looked
up
with
a
sudden
odd
consciousness
the
next
second
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
gasp
and
a
choked
outcry
her
bands
pressed
to
her
breast
ten
paces
in
front
of
her
a
gap
in
the
shrubbery
where
tall
trees
rose
left
a
small
radiant
area
of
illumination
like
that
of
a
in
a
theatre
its
brilliancy
intensified
by
the
dark
foliage
behind
it
was
open
to
view
only
from
the
bench
by
which
she
stood
and
appeared
indeed
like
the
stage
of
a
little
theatre
a
stage
occupied
by
a
bizarre
figure
for
in
the
centre
of
this
shining
patch
with
the
light
strong
on
his
face
was
standing
a
young
man
dressed
in
a
yellow
coat
a
scarlet
and
white
striped
waistcoat
wearing
a
jauntily
cocked
black
hat
on
his
bead
and
even
to
the
last
detail
the
ribbon
laces
above
the
ankle
and
the
shoes
he
was
the
sketch
of
georges
meilhac
sprung
into
life
about
this
slender
figure
there
hung
a
wan
sweetness
like
a
fine
mist
almost
an
ethereality
in
that
light
yet
in
the
pale
face
lurked
something
reckless
something
of
the
actor
too
and
though
his
smile
was
gentle
and
wistful
there
was
a
twinkle
behind
it
not
seen
at
first
something
amused
and
impish
a
small
surprise
underneath
like
a
flea
in
a
fixed
to
the
spot
by
this
apparition
miss
betty
stood
wildly
staring
her
straining
eyelids
showing
the
white
above
and
below
the
large
brown
iris
her
breath
came
faster
and
deeper
until
between
her
parted
lips
it
became
vocal
in
a
quick
sound
like
a
sob
at
that
he
spoke
forgive
me
the
voice
was
low
vibrant
and
so
exceedingly
musical
that
he
might
have
been
accused
of
coolly
selecting
his
best
tone
and
it
became
only
sweeter
when
even
more
softly
in
a
of
almost
crucial
pleading
he
said
ah
do
go
away
in
truth
she
could
not
go
she
had
been
too
vitally
stirred
she
began
to
tremble
excessively
and
sank
back
upon
the
bench
motioning
him
away
with
vague
gestures
of
her
shaking
hands
this
was
more
than
the
incroyable
had
counted
upon
and
far
from
his
desires
he
started
forward
with
an
exclamation
do
come
near
me
she
gasped
who
are
you
go
away
give
me
one
second
to
explain
he
began
but
with
the
instant
reassurance
of
this
beginning
she
cut
him
off
short
her
fears
dispelled
by
his
commonplace
nay
indignation
displaced
them
so
quickly
that
she
fairly
flashed
up
before
him
to
her
full
height
you
did
not
come
in
by
the
gate
she
cried
what
do
you
mean
by
coming
here
in
that
dress
what
right
have
you
in
my
garden
just
one
word
he
begged
quickly
but
very
gently
you
allow
a
that
much
she
stood
before
him
panting
and
as
he
thought
glorious
in
her
flush
of
youth
and
anger
tom
vanrevel
had
painted
her
incoherently
but
richly
in
spite
of
that
his
whole
heart
being
in
the
portrait
and
crailey
gray
had
smiled
at
what
he
deemed
the
exaggeration
of
an
ordinarily
unimpressionable
man
who
had
fallen
in
love
at
first
sight
yet
in
the
presence
of
the
reality
the
incroyable
decided
that
colors
had
been
gray
and
humble
it
was
not
that
she
was
merely
lovely
that
her
nose
was
straight
and
her
chin
dexterously
wrought
between
square
and
oval
that
her
dark
hair
lay
soft
as
a
shadow
on
her
white
brow
not
that
the
trembling
hand
she
held
against
her
breast
sprang
from
a
taper
wrist
and
tapered
again
to
the
tips
of
the
long
fingers
nor
that
she
was
of
that
slenderness
as
strong
as
it
is
delicate
not
all
the
exquisite
regularity
of
line
and
mould
nor
simplicity
of
color
gave
her
that
significance
which
made
the
incroyable
declare
to
himself
that
he
stood
for
the
first
time
in
the
presence
of
beauty
and
that
now
he
knew
the
women
he
had
been
wont
to
call
beautiful
were
but
pretty
and
yet
her
beauty
he
told
himself
was
the
least
of
her
loveliness
for
there
was
a
glamour
about
her
it
was
not
only
the
richness
of
her
youth
but
there
was
an
ineffable
exhalation
which
seemed
to
be
made
partly
of
light
partly
of
the
very
spirit
of
her
and
oddly
enough
partly
of
the
scent
of
the
little
fan
that
hung
by
a
ribbon
from
her
waist
this
was
a
woman
like
a
wine
he
felt
there
was
a
bouquet
in
regard
to
the
bouquet
of
the
young
man
himself
if
he
possessed
one
it
is
pertinent
to
relate
that
at
this
very
instant
the
thought
skipped
across
his
mind
like
the
hop
of
a
flea
in
a
that
some
day
he
might
find
the
moment
when
he
could
tell
her
the
truth
about
herself
with
a
and
say
the
angels
sent
their
haloes
in
a
box
to
be
made
into
a
woman
and
it
was
you
if
you
have
anything
to
say
for
yourself
say
it
quickly
said
miss
betty
you
were
singing
a
while
ago
he
answered
somewhat
huskily
and
i
stopped
on
the
street
to
listen
then
i
came
here
to
be
nearer
the
spell
of
your
voice
he
broke
off
abruptly
to
change
the
word
the
spell
of
the
song
came
over
me
it
is
my
dearest
favorite
so
that
i
stood
afterward
in
a
sort
of
trance
only
hearing
again
in
the
silence
stolen
heart
like
the
gathered
rose
will
bloom
but
for
a
day
i
did
not
see
you
until
you
came
to
the
bench
you
must
believe
me
i
would
not
have
frightened
you
for
anything
in
the
why
are
you
wearing
that
dress
he
laughed
and
pointed
to
where
behind
him
on
the
ground
lay
a
long
gray
cloak
upon
which
had
been
tossed
a
white
mask
i
on
my
way
to
the
masquerade
he
answered
with
an
airy
gesture
in
the
direction
of
the
violins
i
an
incroyable
you
see
and
i
had
the
costume
made
from
my
recollection
of
a
sketch
of
your
i
saw
it
a
long
time
ago
in
your
miss
carewe
accustomed
poise
was
quite
recovered
indeed
she
was
astonished
to
discover
a
distinct
trace
of
disappointment
that
the
brilliant
apparition
must
offer
so
tame
an
explanation
what
he
said
was
palpably
the
truth
there
was
a
masquerade
that
night
she
knew
at
the
madrillon
a
little
way
up
carewe
street
and
her
father
had
gone
an
hour
earlier
a
blue
domino
over
his
arm
the
incroyable
was
a
person
of
almost
magical
perceptiveness
he
felt
the
immediately
and
feared
a
failure
this
would
not
do
the
attitude
of
tension
between
them
must
be
renewed
at
once
forgive
me
he
began
in
a
quickly
impassioned
tone
it
was
only
after
you
sang
a
dream
possessed
me
and
i
can
not
stay
to
talk
with
you
miss
betty
interrupted
and
added
with
a
straightforwardness
which
made
him
afraid
she
would
prove
lamentably
direct
i
do
not
know
perhaps
she
remembered
that
already
one
young
man
had
been
presented
to
her
by
no
better
sponsor
than
a
white
cat
and
had
no
desire
to
carry
her
unconventionality
farther
than
that
in
the
present
instance
there
was
not
even
a
kitten
she
turned
toward
the
house
whereupon
he
gave
a
little
pathetic
exclamation
of
pleading
in
a
voice
that
was
masterly
being
as
sincere
as
it
was
musical
and
he
took
a
few
leaning
steps
toward
her
both
hands
outstretched
one
moment
more
he
cried
as
she
turned
again
to
him
it
may
be
the
one
chance
of
my
life
to
speak
with
you
do
deny
me
all
the
rest
will
meet
you
when
the
happy
evening
comes
will
dance
with
you
talk
with
you
see
you
when
they
like
listen
to
you
sing
i
alone
must
hover
about
the
gates
or
steal
like
a
thief
into
your
garden
to
hear
you
from
a
distance
listen
to
me
just
this
once
for
a
moment
i
can
not
listen
she
said
firmly
and
stood
quite
still
she
was
now
in
deep
shadow
i
will
not
believe
you
merciless
you
would
not
condemn
the
meanest
criminal
unheard
remembering
that
she
was
so
lately
from
the
convent
he
ventured
this
speech
in
a
deep
thrilling
voice
only
to
receive
a
distinct
shock
for
his
pains
for
she
greeted
it
with
an
irrepressible
most
unexpected
peal
of
contralto
laughter
and
his
lips
parted
slightly
with
the
surprise
of
it
they
parted
much
farther
in
the
next
instant
in
good
truth
it
may
be
stated
of
the
gentleman
that
he
was
left
with
his
mouth
open
for
suddenly
leaning
toward
him
out
of
the
shadow
into
the
light
her
face
shining
as
a
cast
of
tragedy
she
cried
in
a
hoarse
whisper
are
you
a
murderer
and
with
that
and
a
whisk
of
her
skirts
and
a
footfall
on
the
gravel
path
she
was
gone
he
stood
dumbfounded
poor
comedian
having
come
to
play
the
chief
role
but
to
find
the
scene
taken
out
of
his
hands
then
catching
the
flutter
of
her
wrap
as
she
disappeared
into
the
darkness
of
the
veranda
he
cried
in
a
loud
manly
voice
you
are
a
dear
as
he
came
out
into
the
street
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
he
paused
drawing
his
cloak
about
him
and
lifted
his
face
to
the
eastern
moon
it
was
a
strange
face
the
modelling
most
like
what
is
called
greek
save
for
the
nose
which
was
a
trifle
too
short
for
that
and
the
features
showed
a
happy
purity
of
outline
almost
childlike
the
blue
eyes
clear
fleckless
serenely
irresponsible
with
more
the
look
of
refusing
responsibility
than
being
unconscious
of
it
eyes
without
care
without
prudence
and
without
evil
a
stranger
might
have
said
he
was
about
and
had
never
a
thought
in
his
life
there
were
some
blossoms
on
the
hedge
and
he
touched
one
lightly
as
though
he
chucked
it
under
the
chin
he
smiled
upon
it
then
but
not
as
he
had
smiled
upon
miss
betty
for
this
was
his
own
the
smile
that
came
when
he
was
alone
and
when
it
came
the
face
was
no
longer
joyous
as
it
had
been
in
repose
there
was
an
infinite
patience
and
worn
for
himself
this
incongruous
and
melancholy
smile
was
astonishing
one
looked
for
the
laughter
of
a
boy
and
found
instead
a
gentle
worldly
old
prelate
standing
there
all
alone
in
the
moonlight
by
the
hedge
he
lifted
both
hands
high
and
waved
them
toward
the
house
as
children
wave
to
each
other
across
lawns
at
twilight
after
that
he
made
a
fantastic
bow
to
his
corrugated
shadow
on
the
board
sidewalk
again
you
rogue
he
exclaimed
aloud
then
as
he
faced
about
and
began
to
walk
in
the
direction
of
the
beckoning
violins
i
wonder
if
tom
kitten
was
better
after
all
chapter
iii
the
rogue
gallery
of
a
father
should
be
exhibited
to
a
daughter
with
particular
care
those
angels
appointed
to
be
guardians
of
the
merry
people
of
rouen
poising
one
night
between
earth
and
stars
discovered
a
single
brilliant
and
resonant
spot
set
in
the
midst
of
the
dark
quiet
town
like
a
jewelled
on
a
black
cloth
sounds
of
revelry
and
the
dance
from
the
luminous
spot
came
up
through
the
summer
stillness
to
the
weary
guardians
all
night
long
until
at
last
when
a
red
glow
stole
into
the
east
and
the
dance
still
continued
nay
grew
faster
than
ever
the
celestial
watchers
found
the
work
too
heavy
for
their
strength
and
forthwith
departed
leaving
the
dancers
to
their
own
devices
for
as
everyone
knows
when
a
dance
lasts
till
daylight
guardian
angels
flee
all
night
long
the
fiddles
had
been
swinging
away
at
their
best
all
night
long
the
candles
had
shone
in
thin
rows
of
bright
orange
through
the
slits
of
the
but
now
as
the
day
broke
over
the
maples
the
shutters
were
flung
open
by
laughing
young
men
and
the
drivers
of
the
carriages
waiting
in
the
dusty
street
pressed
up
closer
to
the
hedge
or
came
within
and
stretched
themselves
upon
the
lawn
to
see
the
people
waltzing
in
the
daylight
the
horses
having
no
such
desires
stood
with
loosened
slightly
twitching
their
upper
lips
wistful
of
the
tall
grass
which
bordered
the
wooden
sidewalk
though
now
and
then
one
would
lift
his
head
high
sniffing
the
morning
air
and
bending
an
earnest
gaze
not
upon
the
dancers
but
upon
the
florid
east
over
the
unwearied
plaint
of
violin
and
bassoon
rose
a
silvery
confusion
of
voices
and
laughter
and
the
sound
of
a
hundred
footfalls
in
unison
while
from
the
open
windows
there
issued
a
warm
breath
heavily
laden
with
the
smell
of
scented
fans
of
rich
fabrics
of
dying
roses
to
mingle
with
the
spicy
perfume
of
a
wild
in
fullest
blossom
which
stood
near
enough
to
peer
into
the
and
like
a
brocaded
belle
herself
challenge
the
richest
to
show
raiment
as
fine
the
loveliest
to
look
as
fair
and
joyful
in
the
believe
me
of
all
those
endearing
young
charms
which
i
gaze
on
so
fondly
were
to
fade
by
and
fleet
from
my
arms
like
fairy
gifts
fading
away
so
ran
the
violins
in
waltz
time
so
bassoon
and
horn
to
those
dulcet
measures
and
then
with
one
accord
a
hundred
voices
joined
them
in
the
old
sweet
melody
thou
wouldst
still
be
adored
as
this
moment
thou
art
let
thy
loveliness
fade
as
it
will
and
around
the
dear
ruin
each
wish
of
my
heart
would
entwine
itself
verdantly
and
the
jealous
found
but
one
to
overmatch
itself
in
beauty
a
lady
who
was
the
focus
of
the
singing
for
by
the
time
the
shutters
were
flung
open
there
was
not
a
young
man
in
the
room
lacked
he
never
so
greatly
in
music
or
in
voice
who
did
not
heartily
desire
to
sing
to
miss
betty
carewe
and
who
did
not
now
craning
neck
over
shoulder
seek
to
fix
her
with
his
glittering
eye
while
he
sang
oh
believe
me
most
directly
and
conspicuously
at
her
for
that
night
was
the
beginning
of
miss
betty
famous
career
as
the
belle
of
rouen
and
was
the
date
from
which
strangers
were
to
hear
of
her
as
the
beautiful
miss
carewe
until
beautiful
was
left
off
visitors
to
the
town
being
supposed
to
have
heard
at
least
that
much
before
they
came
there
had
been
much
discussion
of
her
though
only
one
or
two
had
caught
glimpses
of
her
but
most
of
the
gallants
appeared
to
agree
with
crailey
gray
who
aired
his
opinion
in
an
exceedingly
casual
way
at
the
little
club
on
main
street
gray
held
that
when
the
daughter
of
a
man
as
rich
as
bob
carewe
was
heralded
as
a
beauty
the
chances
were
that
she
would
prove
disappointing
and
for
his
part
he
was
not
even
interested
enough
to
attend
and
investigate
so
he
was
going
down
the
river
in
a
canoe
and
preferred
the
shyness
of
bass
to
that
of
a
girl
of
eighteen
just
from
the
convent
he
said
tom
vanrevel
was
not
present
on
the
occasion
of
these
remarks
and
the
general
concurrence
with
crailey
may
be
suspected
as
a
purely
verbal
one
since
when
the
evening
came
two
of
the
most
enthusiastic
dancers
and
of
the
town
the
handsome
tappingham
marsh
and
that
doughty
and
indian
fighter
stout
old
general
trumble
were
upon
the
field
before
the
enemy
appeared
that
is
to
say
they
were
in
the
new
before
their
host
indeed
the
musicians
had
not
arrived
and
nelson
an
aged
negro
servitor
was
engaged
in
lighting
the
house
the
crafty
pair
had
planned
this
early
descent
with
a
view
to
monopoly
by
right
of
priority
in
case
the
game
proved
worth
the
candle
and
they
were
leaning
effectively
against
the
little
railing
about
the
platform
when
carewe
entered
the
room
with
his
daughter
on
his
arm
she
was
in
white
touched
with
countless
small
lavender
flowers
there
were
rows
and
rows
of
wonderful
silk
and
lace
flounces
on
her
skirt
and
her
fan
hung
from
a
rope
of
great
pearls
ah
hideous
blue
rough
cloth
of
the
convent
unforgotten
but
laid
aside
forever
what
a
chrysalis
you
were
tappingham
twitched
his
companion
sleeve
but
the
general
was
already
posing
and
neither
heard
the
words
of
presentation
because
miss
betty
gave
each
of
them
a
quick
look
then
smiled
upon
them
as
they
bowed
the
slayers
were
prostrated
before
their
prey
never
were
more
instantaneously
tamed
and
subjugated
by
the
power
of
the
feminine
eye
will
cummings
came
in
soon
and
almost
upon
his
heels
eugene
madrillon
and
young
frank
chenoweth
no
others
appeared
for
half
an
hour
and
the
five
gentlemen
looked
at
one
another
aside
each
divining
his
own
diplomacy
in
his
fellow
eye
and
each
laboriously
explaining
to
the
others
his
own
mistake
in
regard
to
the
hour
designated
upon
carewe
cards
of
invitation
this
small
embarrassment
however
did
not
prevent
general
trumble
and
young
chenoweth
from
coming
to
high
words
over
miss
carewe
little
programme
of
dances
it
may
be
not
untimely
to
remark
also
of
these
five
redoubtable
beaux
that
during
the
evening
it
occurred
to
every
one
of
them
to
be
glad
that
crailey
gray
was
betrothed
to
fanchon
bareaud
and
that
he
was
down
on
the
rouen
river
with
a
canoe
a
rod
and
a
tent
nay
without
more
words
to
declare
the
truth
in
regard
to
crailey
they
felt
greater
security
in
his
absence
from
the
field
than
in
his
betrothal
as
chenoweth
a
youth
as
open
as
both
in
countenance
and
mind
observed
plaintively
to
tappingham
marsh
in
a
corner
while
they
watched
miss
betty
lavender
flowers
miraculously
swirling
through
a
quadrille
crailey
you
know
well
crailey
been
engaged
before
it
was
not
chenoweth
habit
to
disguise
his
apprehensions
and
crailey
gray
would
not
fish
for
bass
forever
the
same
chenoweth
was
he
who
maddened
by
the
general
triumphantly
familiar
way
of
toying
with
miss
betty
fan
between
two
dances
attempted
to
propose
to
her
during
the
sunrise
waltz
having
sung
oh
believe
me
in
her
ear
as
loudly
as
he
could
he
expressed
the
wish
quite
as
loudly
that
this
waltz
might
last
for
always
that
was
the
seventh
time
it
had
been
said
to
betty
during
the
night
and
though
chenoweth
predecessors
had
revealed
their
desires
in
a
guise
lacking
this
prodigious
artlessness
she
already
possessed
no
novel
acquaintance
with
the
exclamation
but
she
made
no
comment
her
partner
style
was
not
a
stimulant
to
repartee
it
would
be
heaven
he
amplified
earnestly
it
would
be
heaven
to
dance
with
you
forever
on
a
desert
isle
where
the
others
could
come
he
finished
with
sudden
acerbity
as
his
eye
caught
the
general
he
proceeded
and
only
the
cessation
of
the
music
aided
miss
carewe
in
stopping
the
declaration
before
it
was
altogether
out
and
at
that
point
frank
own
father
came
to
her
rescue
though
in
a
fashion
little
saving
of
her
confusion
the
elder
chenoweth
was
one
of
the
gallant
and
kindly
southern
colony
that
made
it
natural
for
rouen
always
to
speak
of
miss
carewe
as
miss
betty
he
was
a
handsome
old
fellow
whose
hair
long
moustache
and
imperial
were
as
white
as
he
was
proud
of
them
a
virginian
with
the
admirable
southern
fearlessness
of
being
thought
sentimental
mounting
a
chair
with
complete
dignity
he
lifted
a
glass
of
wine
high
in
the
air
and
when
all
the
other
glasses
had
been
filled
proposed
the
health
of
his
young
hostess
he
made
a
speech
of
some
length
pronouncing
himself
quite
as
hopelessly
in
love
with
his
old
friend
daughter
as
all
could
see
his
own
son
was
and
wishing
her
long
life
and
prosperity
with
many
allusions
to
fragrant
bowers
and
the
muses
it
made
miss
betty
happy
but
it
was
rather
trying
too
for
she
could
only
stand
with
downcast
eyes
before
them
all
trembling
a
little
and
receiving
a
mixed
impression
of
chenoweth
remarks
catching
fragments
here
and
there
and
may
the
blush
upon
that
gentle
cheek
lovelier
than
the
radiant
clouds
at
set
of
sun
and
yet
the
sands
of
the
must
fall
and
in
the
calm
and
beauteous
old
age
some
day
to
be
her
lot
when
fond
leads
her
back
to
view
again
the
brilliant
scene
about
her
now
where
stand
women
and
brave
men
winecup
in
hand
to
do
her
honor
oh
may
she
wipe
the
silent
tear
and
the
like
as
the
old
gentleman
finished
and
before
the
toast
was
drunk
fanchon
bareaud
kissing
her
hand
to
betty
took
up
the
song
again
and
they
all
joined
in
lifting
their
glasses
to
the
blushing
and
happy
girl
clinging
to
her
father
arm
thou
wouldst
still
be
adored
as
this
moment
thou
art
let
thy
loveliness
fade
as
it
will
and
around
the
dear
ruin
each
wish
of
my
heart
would
entwine
itself
verdantly
they
were
happy
people
who
had
not
learned
to
be
enough
to
fear
doing
a
pretty
thing
openly
without
mocking
themselves
for
it
and
it
was
a
brave
circle
they
made
about
betty
carewe
the
charming
faces
of
the
women
and
their
fine
furbelows
handsome
men
and
tall
all
so
gay
so
cheerily
smiling
and
yet
so
earnest
in
their
welcome
to
her
no
one
was
afraid
to
let
out
his
voice
their
song
went
full
and
strong
over
the
waking
town
and
when
it
was
finished
the
ball
was
over
too
the
veranda
and
the
path
to
the
gate
became
like
tropic
gardens
the
fair
colors
of
the
women
dresses
ballooning
in
the
early
breeze
making
the
place
seem
strewn
with
giant
blossoms
they
all
went
away
at
the
same
time
those
in
carriages
calling
farewells
to
each
other
and
to
the
little
processions
departing
on
foot
in
different
directions
to
homes
near
by
the
sound
of
the
voices
and
laughter
drew
away
slowly
died
out
altogether
and
the
silence
of
the
street
was
strange
and
unfamiliar
to
betty
she
went
to
the
hedge
and
watched
the
musicians
who
were
the
last
to
go
until
they
passed
from
sight
little
black
toilsome
figures
carrying
grotesque
black
boxes
while
she
could
still
see
them
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
ball
was
not
quite
over
and
she
wished
to
hold
the
least
speck
of
it
as
long
as
she
could
but
when
they
had
disappeared
she
faced
the
truth
with
a
deep
sigh
the
long
glorious
night
was
finished
indeed
what
she
needed
now
was
another
girl
the
two
would
have
gone
to
room
and
danced
it
all
over
again
until
noon
but
she
had
only
her
father
she
found
him
smoking
a
principe
cigar
upon
the
veranda
so
she
seated
herself
timidly
nevertheless
with
a
hopeful
glance
at
him
on
the
steps
at
his
feet
and
as
she
did
so
he
looked
down
upon
her
with
something
more
akin
to
geniality
than
anything
she
had
ever
seen
in
his
eye
before
it
was
not
geniality
itself
but
might
be
third
cousin
to
it
indeed
in
his
way
he
was
almost
proud
of
her
though
he
had
no
wish
to
show
it
since
one
was
compelled
to
display
the
fact
that
one
possessed
a
grown
daughter
it
was
well
that
she
be
like
this
one
they
did
not
know
each
other
very
well
and
she
often
doubted
that
they
would
ever
become
intimate
there
was
no
sense
of
companionship
for
either
in
the
other
she
had
been
unable
to
break
through
his
perfunctory
almost
formal
manner
with
her
therefore
because
he
encouraged
no
in
her
she
felt
none
and
wondered
why
since
he
was
her
father
she
was
more
curious
about
him
than
interested
and
though
she
did
not
know
it
she
was
prepared
to
judge
him
should
occasion
arise
precisely
as
she
would
judge
any
other
mere
acquaintance
this
morning
for
the
first
time
she
was
conscious
of
a
sense
of
warmth
and
gratitude
toward
him
the
elaborate
fashion
in
which
he
had
introduced
her
to
his
friends
made
it
appear
possible
that
he
liked
her
for
he
had
forgotten
nothing
and
to
remember
everything
in
this
case
was
to
be
lavish
which
has
often
the
appearance
of
generosity
and
yet
there
had
been
a
lack
some
small
thing
she
had
missed
though
she
was
not
entirely
sure
that
she
identified
it
but
the
lack
had
not
been
in
her
father
or
in
anything
he
had
done
then
too
there
was
something
so
unexpectedly
human
and
pleasant
in
his
not
going
to
bed
at
once
but
remaining
to
smoke
on
the
veranda
at
this
hour
that
she
gave
him
credit
for
a
little
of
her
own
excitement
innocently
fancying
that
he
also
might
feel
the
need
of
a
companion
with
whom
to
talk
over
the
brilliant
passages
of
the
night
and
a
moment
ensued
when
she
debated
taking
his
hand
she
was
too
soon
glad
that
her
intuition
forbade
the
demonstration
it
was
all
so
beautiful
papa
she
said
timidly
i
have
no
way
to
tell
you
how
i
thank
you
may
do
that
he
replied
evenly
with
no
unkindness
with
no
kindness
either
in
the
level
of
his
tone
by
never
dancing
again
more
than
twice
with
one
man
in
one
i
think
i
should
much
prefer
not
myself
she
returned
lifting
her
head
to
face
him
gravely
i
believe
if
i
cared
to
dance
more
than
once
with
one
i
should
like
to
dance
all
of
them
with
carewe
frowned
i
trust
that
you
discovered
none
last
night
whom
you
wished
to
honor
with
your
entire
programme
no
she
laughed
not
last
her
father
tossed
away
his
cigar
abruptly
is
it
too
much
to
hope
he
inquired
that
when
you
discover
a
gentleman
with
whom
you
desire
to
waltz
all
night
you
will
omit
to
mention
the
fact
to
him
there
was
a
brief
flash
of
her
eye
as
she
recalled
her
impulse
to
take
his
hand
but
she
immediately
looked
at
him
with
such
complete
seriousness
that
he
feared
his
irony
had
been
thrown
away
i
remember
not
to
mention
it
she
answered
i
tell
him
you
told
me
not
i
think
you
may
retire
now
said
carewe
sharply
she
rose
from
the
steps
went
to
the
door
then
turned
at
the
threshold
were
all
your
friends
here
papa
do
you
think
that
every
ninny
who
gabbled
in
my
house
last
night
was
my
friend
he
said
angrily
there
was
one
friend
of
mine
tanberry
who
was
here
because
she
is
out
of
town
but
i
do
not
imagine
that
you
are
inquiring
about
women
you
mean
was
every
unmarried
male
idiot
who
could
afford
a
coat
and
a
clean
pair
of
gloves
cavorting
about
the
place
yes
miss
they
were
all
here
except
two
and
one
of
those
is
a
fool
the
other
a
ca
i
know
the
fool
she
asked
eagerly
i
rejoice
to
find
them
so
rare
in
your
experience
he
retorted
this
one
is
out
of
town
though
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
see
him
sufficiently
often
when
he
returns
his
name
is
crailey
gray
and
he
is
to
marry
fanchon
bareaud
if
he
remembers
and
the
knave
is
one
carewe
shut
his
teeth
with
a
venomous
snap
and
his
whole
face
reddened
suddenly
i
mention
this
fellow
once
now
he
said
speaking
each
word
with
emphasis
his
name
is
vanrevel
you
see
that
gate
you
see
the
line
of
my
property
there
the
man
himself
as
well
as
every
other
person
in
the
town
remembers
well
that
the
last
time
i
spoke
to
him
it
was
to
tell
him
that
if
he
ever
set
foot
on
ground
of
mine
i
shoot
him
down
and
he
knows
and
they
all
know
i
shall
keep
my
word
elsewhere
i
told
him
that
for
the
sake
of
public
peace
i
should
ignore
him
i
do
you
will
see
him
everywhere
but
it
will
not
be
difficult
no
one
will
have
the
hardihood
to
present
him
to
my
daughter
the
quarrel
between
us
carewe
broke
off
for
a
moment
his
hands
clinching
the
arms
of
his
chair
while
he
swallowed
with
difficulty
as
though
he
choked
upon
some
acrid
bolus
and
he
was
so
strongly
agitated
by
his
own
mention
of
his
enemy
that
he
controlled
himself
by
a
painful
effort
of
his
will
the
quarrel
between
us
is
political
and
personal
you
will
i
shall
remember
she
answered
in
a
rather
frightened
voice
it
was
long
before
she
fell
asleep
i
alone
must
hover
about
the
gates
or
steal
into
your
garden
like
a
thief
the
incroyable
had
said
the
last
time
i
spoke
to
him
it
was
to
tell
him
that
if
he
ever
set
foot
on
ground
of
mine
i
shoot
him
down
had
been
her
declaration
and
carewe
had
spoken
with
the
most
undeniable
air
of
meaning
what
he
said
yet
she
knew
that
the
incroyable
would
come
again
also
with
hot
cheeks
pressed
into
her
pillow
miss
betty
had
identified
the
young
man
in
the
white
hat
that
dark
person
whose
hand
she
had
far
too
impetuously
seized
in
both
of
hers
aha
it
was
this
gentleman
who
looked
into
people
eyes
and
stammered
so
sincerely
over
a
pretty
speech
that
you
almost
believed
him
it
was
he
who
was
to
marry
fanchon
bareaud
if
he
remembers
no
wonder
fanchon
had
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
him
away
if
he
remembers
such
was
that
young
character
was
it
miss
carewe
laughed
aloud
to
her
pillow
for
was
one
to
guess
the
reason
also
of
his
not
having
come
to
her
ball
had
the
poor
man
been
commanded
to
be
out
of
town
then
remembering
the
piquant
and
generous
face
of
fanchon
betty
clinched
her
fingers
tightly
and
crushed
the
imp
who
had
suggested
the
unworthy
thought
crushed
him
to
a
wretched
pulp
and
threw
him
out
of
the
open
window
he
immediately
sneaked
in
by
the
back
way
for
in
spite
of
her
victory
she
still
felt
a
little
sorry
for
poor
fanchon
chapter
iv
but
spare
your
country
flag
if
it
be
true
that
love
is
the
great
incentive
to
the
useless
arts
the
number
of
gentlemen
who
became
poets
for
the
sake
of
miss
betty
carewe
need
not
be
considered
extraordinary
of
all
that
was
written
of
her
dancing
tom
vanrevel
lines
i
danced
with
her
beneath
the
lights
which
he
certainly
had
not
done
when
he
wrote
them
were
perhaps
next
to
crailey
gray
in
merit
though
tom
burned
his
rhymes
after
reading
them
to
crailey
other
troubadours
were
not
so
modest
and
the
rouen
journal
found
no
lack
of
tuneful
offering
that
spring
generously
all
of
it
even
at
the
period
when
it
became
epidemic
the
public
had
little
difficulty
in
recognizing
the
work
of
francis
chenoweth
in
an
anonymous
sonnet
of
lines
which
appeared
in
the
issue
following
miss
carewe
debut
chenoweth
wrote
that
while
dancing
the
mazourka
with
a
lovely
being
the
sweetest
feelings
of
his
soul
in
a
celestial
stream
bore
him
away
beyond
control
in
a
seraphic
dream
and
he
untruthfully
stated
that
at
the
same
time
he
saw
her
wipe
the
silent
tear
omitting
however
to
venture
any
explanation
of
the
cause
of
her
emotion
old
general
trumble
boldly
signed
his
poem
in
full
it
was
called
an
ode
upon
miss
c
waltzing
and
it
began
when
bettina
found
fair
rouen
shore
and
her
aged
father
to
us
bore
her
from
the
cloister
neat
she
waltzed
upon
the
floor
and
lightly
twirled
upon
her
carewe
was
rightfully
indignant
and
refused
to
acknowledge
the
general
salutation
at
their
next
meeting
trumble
was
fifteen
years
older
than
he
as
crailey
gray
never
danced
with
miss
carewe
it
is
somewhat
singular
that
she
should
have
been
the
inspiration
of
his
swinging
verses
in
waltz
measure
on
a
violin
the
sense
of
which
was
that
when
a
violin
had
played
for
her
dancing
the
instrument
should
be
shattered
as
are
after
a
great
toast
however
no
one
except
the
author
himself
knew
that
betty
was
the
subject
for
crailey
certainly
did
not
mention
it
to
miss
bareaud
nor
to
his
best
friend
vanrevel
it
was
to
some
degree
a
strange
comradeship
between
these
two
young
men
their
tastes
led
them
so
often
in
opposite
directions
they
had
rooms
over
their
offices
in
the
madrillon
block
on
main
street
and
the
lights
shone
late
from
their
windows
every
night
in
the
year
sometimes
that
would
mean
only
that
the
two
friends
were
talking
for
they
never
reached
a
silent
intimacy
but
even
after
several
years
of
companionship
were
rarely
seen
together
when
not
in
interested
often
eager
conversation
so
that
people
wondered
what
in
the
world
they
still
found
to
say
to
each
other
but
many
a
night
the
lamp
meant
that
tom
sat
alone
with
a
brief
or
a
book
or
wooed
the
long
hours
with
his
magical
guitar
for
he
never
went
to
bed
until
the
other
came
home
and
if
daylight
came
without
crailey
vanrevel
would
go
out
yawning
mightily
to
look
for
him
and
when
there
was
no
finding
him
tom
would
come
back
sleepless
to
the
day
work
crailey
was
called
peculiar
and
he
explained
with
a
kind
of
jovial
helplessness
that
he
was
always
prepared
for
the
unexpected
in
himself
nor
did
such
a
view
detract
from
his
picturesqueness
to
his
own
perusal
of
himself
though
it
was
not
only
to
himself
that
he
was
interesting
to
the
vision
of
the
in
rouen
quiet
souls
who
hovered
along
the
walls
at
and
cheerfully
counted
themselves
spectators
at
the
play
crailey
gray
held
the
centre
of
the
stage
and
was
the
chief
comedian
of
the
place
wit
poet
and
scapegrace
the
small
society
sometimes
seemed
the
mere
background
set
for
his
performances
spectacles
which
he
also
enjoyed
and
from
the
best
seat
in
the
house
for
he
was
not
content
as
the
actor
but
must
be
the
prince
in
the
box
as
well
his
friendship
for
tom
vanrevel
was
in
a
measure
that
of
the
vine
for
the
oak
he
was
full
of
levities
at
tom
expense
which
the
other
bore
with
a
grin
of
sympathetic
comprehension
or
at
long
intervals
returned
upon
crailey
with
devastating
effect
vanrevel
was
the
one
steadying
thing
in
his
life
and
at
the
same
time
the
only
one
of
the
young
men
upon
whom
he
did
not
have
an
almost
mesmeric
influence
in
good
truth
crailey
was
the
ringleader
in
all
the
devilries
of
the
town
many
a
youth
swore
to
avoid
the
roisterer
company
for
all
time
and
within
two
hours
of
the
vow
found
himself
flagon
in
hand
engaged
in
a
bout
that
would
last
the
night
with
gray
the
hardiest
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
the
next
morning
the
fevered
perjurer
might
creep
shaking
to
his
wretched
tasks
only
to
behold
the
cause
of
his
folly
and
headache
tripping
merrily
along
the
street
smiling
and
fresh
as
a
primrose
with
perchance
two
or
three
of
the
prettiest
girls
in
town
at
his
elbow
to
greet
his
sallies
with
approving
laughter
crailey
had
been
so
long
in
the
habit
of
following
every
impulse
no
matter
how
mad
that
he
enjoyed
an
almost
perfect
immunity
from
condemnation
and
whatever
his
deeds
rouen
had
learned
to
say
with
a
chuckle
that
it
was
only
crailey
gray
but
his
followers
were
not
so
privileged
thus
when
gray
who
in
his
libations
sometimes
developed
the
humor
of
an
urchin
went
to
the
pound
at
three
in
the
morning
of
new
year
day
hung
about
the
necks
of
the
cattle
and
drove
them
up
and
down
the
streets
himself
hideously
blowing
a
bass
horn
from
the
back
of
a
big
brown
steer
those
roused
from
slumber
ceased
to
rage
and
accepted
the
exploit
as
a
rare
joke
on
learning
that
it
was
only
crailey
gray
but
the
unfortunate
young
chenoweth
was
heavily
frowned
upon
and
properly
upbraided
because
he
had
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
bovine
procession
mildly
attempting
to
play
upon
a
flageolet
crailey
never
denied
a
folly
nor
defended
an
escapade
the
latter
was
always
done
for
him
because
he
talked
of
his
graceless
misdoings
so
he
was
wont
smilingly
to
call
them
over
cups
of
tea
in
the
afternoons
with
old
ladies
lamenting
in
his
musical
voice
the
lack
of
female
relatives
to
guide
him
he
was
charmingly
attentive
to
the
elderly
women
not
from
policy
but
because
his
manner
was
uncontrollably
chivalrous
and
ever
a
gallant
listener
were
the
speaker
young
old
great
or
humble
he
never
forgot
to
catch
the
last
words
of
a
sentence
and
seldom
suffered
for
a
reply
even
when
he
had
drowsed
through
a
question
moreover
no
one
ever
heard
him
speak
a
sullen
word
nor
saw
him
wear
a
brow
of
depression
the
single
creed
to
which
he
was
constant
was
that
of
good
cheer
he
was
the
very
apostle
of
gayety
preaching
it
in
parlor
and
bar
and
made
merry
friends
with
battered
tramps
and
homeless
dogs
in
the
streets
at
night
now
and
then
he
would
spend
several
days
in
the
offices
of
gray
vanrevel
attorneys
and
wearing
an
air
of
unassailable
virtue
though
he
did
not
far
overstate
the
case
when
he
said
tom
does
all
the
work
and
gives
me
all
the
money
not
to
bother
him
when
he
getting
up
a
the
working
member
of
the
firm
got
up
cases
to
notable
effect
and
few
lawyers
in
the
state
enjoyed
having
tom
vanrevel
on
the
other
side
there
was
nothing
about
him
of
the
floridity
prevalent
at
that
time
he
withered
oratory
before
the
court
he
was
the
foe
of
jury
pathos
and
despising
noise
and
the
habitual
at
the
end
of
a
sentence
was
nevertheless
at
times
an
almost
fearfully
effective
orator
so
by
degrees
the
firm
of
gray
vanrevel
young
as
it
was
and
in
spite
of
the
idle
apprentice
had
grown
to
be
the
most
prosperous
in
the
district
for
this
eminence
crailey
was
never
accused
of
assuming
the
credit
nor
did
he
ever
miss
an
opportunity
of
making
known
how
much
he
owed
to
his
partner
what
he
owed
in
brief
was
everything
how
well
vanrevel
worked
was
demonstrated
every
day
but
how
hard
he
worked
only
crailey
knew
the
latter
had
grown
to
depend
upon
him
for
even
his
political
beliefs
and
lightly
followed
his
partner
into
abolitionism
though
that
was
to
risk
unpopularity
bitter
hatred
and
worse
fortunately
on
certain
occasions
vanrevel
had
made
himself
if
not
his
creed
respected
at
least
so
far
that
there
was
no
longer
danger
of
for
an
abolitionist
in
rouen
he
was
a
young
man
ordinarily
and
possessed
of
an
elusive
forcefulness
not
to
be
trifled
with
though
he
was
a
quiet
man
and
had
what
they
called
a
fine
and
not
in
the
latter
but
in
his
dress
there
was
an
echo
of
the
beau
which
afforded
gray
a
point
of
attack
for
sallies
of
wit
there
was
a
touch
of
the
dandy
about
vanrevel
he
had
a
large
and
versatile
wardrobe
and
his
clothes
always
fit
him
not
only
in
line
but
in
color
even
women
saw
how
nobly
they
were
fashioned
these
two
young
men
were
members
of
a
cheerful
band
who
feasted
laughed
wrangled
over
politics
danced
made
love
and
sang
terrible
chords
on
summer
evenings
together
as
young
men
will
will
cummings
editor
of
the
rouen
journal
was
one
of
these
a
tall
sallow
man
very
thin
very
awkward
and
very
gentle
cummings
proved
himself
always
ready
with
a
loud
and
friendly
laugh
for
the
poorest
joke
in
the
world
his
countenance
shining
with
such
kindness
that
no
one
ever
had
the
heart
to
reproach
him
with
the
evils
of
his
journalistic
performances
or
for
the
things
he
broke
when
he
danced
another
was
tappingham
marsh
an
exceedingly
handsome
person
somewhat
languid
in
appearance
dainty
in
manner
with
women
offhand
with
men
almost
as
reckless
as
crailey
and
often
the
latter
companion
and
assistant
in
dissipation
young
francis
chenoweth
never
failed
to
follow
both
into
whatever
they
planned
he
was
short
and
pink
and
the
uptilt
of
his
nose
was
coherent
with
the
appealing
which
was
habitual
with
him
eugene
madrillon
was
the
sixth
of
these
intimates
a
dark
man
whose
latin
eyes
and
color
advertised
his
french
ancestry
as
plainly
as
his
emotionless
mouth
and
lack
of
gesture
betrayed
the
mingling
of
another
strain
all
these
and
others
of
the
town
were
wont
to
talk
politics
a
great
deal
at
the
little
club
on
main
street
and
all
were
apt
to
fall
foul
of
tom
vanrevel
or
crailey
gray
before
the
end
of
any
discussion
for
those
were
the
days
when
they
twisted
the
lion
tail
in
vehement
and
bitter
earnest
when
the
eagle
screamed
in
mixed
figures
when
few
men
knew
how
to
talk
and
many
orated
when
party
strife
was
savagely
personal
when
intolerance
was
called
the
pure
fire
of
patriotism
when
criticism
of
the
existing
order
of
things
surely
incurred
fiery
anathema
and
black
invective
and
brave
was
he
indeed
who
dared
to
hint
that
his
country
as
a
whole
and
politically
did
lack
some
two
or
three
particular
virtues
and
that
the
first
step
toward
obtaining
them
would
be
to
help
it
to
realize
their
absence
this
latter
was
that
of
the
firm
of
gray
vanrevel
which
was
a
unit
in
such
matters
crailey
did
most
of
the
talking
quite
beautifully
too
and
both
had
to
stand
against
odds
in
many
a
sour
argument
for
they
were
not
only
abolitionists
but
opposed
the
attitude
of
their
country
in
its
difficulty
with
mexico
and
in
common
with
other
men
of
the
time
who
took
their
stand
they
had
to
grow
accustomed
to
being
called
disloyal
traitors
foreign
toadies
malignants
and
traducers
of
the
flag
tom
had
long
been
used
to
epithets
of
this
sort
suffering
their
sting
in
quiet
and
was
glad
when
he
could
keep
crailey
out
of
worse
employment
than
standing
firm
for
an
unpopular
belief
there
was
one
place
to
which
vanrevel
seeking
his
friend
and
partner
when
the
latter
did
not
come
home
at
night
could
not
go
this
was
the
tower
chamber
and
it
was
in
that
mysterious
apartment
of
the
carewe
cupola
that
crailey
was
apt
to
be
deeply
occupied
when
he
remained
away
until
daylight
strange
as
it
appears
gray
maintained
peculiar
relations
of
intimacy
with
robert
carewe
in
spite
of
the
feud
between
carewe
and
his
own
best
friend
this
intimacy
which
did
not
necessarily
imply
any
mutual
fondness
though
crailey
seemed
to
dislike
nobody
was
betokened
by
a
furtive
understanding
of
a
sort
between
them
they
held
brief
earnest
conversations
on
the
street
or
in
corners
when
they
met
at
other
people
houses
always
speaking
in
voices
too
low
to
be
overheard
and
they
exercised
a
mysterious
symbolism
somewhat
in
the
manner
of
fellow
members
of
a
secret
society
they
had
been
observed
to
communicate
across
crowded
rooms
by
lifted
eyebrow
nod
of
head
or
a
surreptitious
turn
of
the
wrist
so
that
those
who
observed
them
knew
that
a
question
had
been
asked
and
answered
it
was
noticed
also
that
there
were
five
other
initiates
to
this
masonry
eugene
madrillon
the
elder
chenoweth
general
trumble
tappingham
marsh
and
jefferson
bareaud
thus
on
the
afternoon
following
miss
betty
introduction
to
rouen
favorite
sons
and
daughters
carewe
driving
down
main
street
held
up
one
forefinger
to
madrillon
as
he
saw
the
young
man
turning
in
at
the
club
eugene
nodded
gravely
and
as
he
went
in
discovering
marsh
the
general
and
others
listening
to
gray
explanation
of
his
return
from
the
river
with
no
fish
stealthily
held
up
one
finger
in
his
turn
trumble
replied
with
a
wink
tappingham
nodded
but
crailey
slightly
shook
his
head
marsh
and
the
general
started
with
surprise
and
stared
incredulously
that
crailey
should
shake
his
head
if
the
signal
had
been
for
a
they
might
have
understood
gray
conduct
was
surprising
two
other
people
at
about
the
same
time
tom
vanrevel
and
fanchon
bareaud
the
former
by
his
sudden
devotion
to
the
law
the
latter
by
her
sudden
devotion
to
herself
in
a
breath
he
became
almost
a
domestic
character
no
more
did
he
spend
his
afternoons
between
the
club
and
the
rouen
house
bar
nor
was
his
bay
mare
so
often
seen
stamping
down
the
ground
about
while
mcdougal
was
out
on
the
prairie
with
his
engineering
squad
the
idle
apprentice
was
at
his
desk
and
in
the
daytime
he
displayed
an
aversion
for
the
streets
which
was
more
than
his
partner
did
for
the
industrious
tom
undergoing
quite
as
remarkable
an
alteration
of
habit
became
all
at
once
little
better
than
a
his
favorite
was
a
small
where
carewe
street
debouched
upon
main
nevertheless
so
adhesive
is
a
reputation
once
fastened
his
air
of
being
there
upon
business
deceived
everyone
except
gray
miss
bareaud
was
even
happier
than
she
was
astonished
and
she
was
mightily
astonished
to
find
her
betrothed
developing
a
taste
for
her
society
alone
formerly
she
had
counted
upon
the
gayeties
of
her
home
to
keep
crailey
near
her
now
however
he
told
her
tenderly
he
wished
to
have
her
all
to
himself
this
was
not
like
him
but
fanchon
did
not
question
and
it
was
very
sweet
to
her
that
he
began
to
make
it
his
custom
to
come
in
by
a
side
gate
and
meet
her
under
an
in
the
dusk
where
they
would
sit
quietly
together
through
the
evening
listening
to
the
noise
and
laughter
from
the
lighted
house
that
house
was
the
most
hospitable
in
rouen
always
cheerfully
full
of
company
as
they
said
it
was
the
sort
of
house
where
a
could
be
arranged
in
half
an
hour
a
house
with
a
sideboard
like
the
widow
cruse
the
young
men
always
found
more
bareaud
a
southerner
loving
to
persuade
the
visitor
that
her
home
was
his
not
hers
lived
only
for
her
art
which
was
that
of
the
table
evil
cooks
taking
service
with
her
became
virtuous
dealt
with
nectar
and
ambrosia
and
grew
fit
to
pander
to
olympus
learning
of
their
mistress
secrets
to
make
the
as
genial
gods
ere
they
departed
bareaud
at
fifty
had
lived
so
well
that
he
gave
up
walking
which
did
not
trouble
him
but
at
sixty
he
gave
up
dancing
which
did
trouble
him
his
only
hope
he
declared
was
in
crailey
gray
promise
to
invent
for
him
a
concave
partner
there
was
a
thin
quizzing
shank
of
a
son
jefferson
who
lived
upon
quinine
ague
and
deviltry
and
there
were
the
two
daughters
fanchon
and
virginia
the
latter
was
three
years
older
than
fanchon
as
dark
as
fanchon
was
fair
though
not
nearly
so
pretty
a
small
romping
sprite
of
a
girl
who
had
handed
down
the
heart
and
hand
of
crailey
gray
to
her
sister
with
the
best
grace
in
the
world
for
she
had
been
the
heroine
of
one
of
gray
or
so
most
serious
affairs
and
after
a
furious
rivalry
with
carewe
the
victory
was
generally
conceded
to
crailey
his
triumph
had
been
of
about
a
duration
when
fanchon
returned
from
mary
and
with
the
advent
of
the
younger
sister
the
elder
who
had
decided
that
crailey
was
the
incomparable
she
had
dreamed
of
since
infancy
was
generously
allowed
to
discover
that
he
was
not
that
vision
that
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
own
idea
of
him
whereas
fanchon
cared
only
that
he
be
crailey
gray
whatever
kind
of
vision
that
was
and
fanchon
discovered
that
it
was
a
great
many
kinds
the
transfer
was
made
comfortably
with
nice
judgment
of
a
respectable
interregnum
and
to
the
greater
happiness
of
each
of
the
three
young
people
no
objection
ensuing
from
the
parents
who
were
devotedly
fond
of
crailey
while
the
town
laughed
and
said
it
was
only
that
absurd
crailey
gray
again
he
and
virginia
were
the
best
of
friends
and
accepted
their
new
relation
with
a
preposterous
lack
of
embarrassment
to
be
in
love
with
crailey
became
fanchon
vocation
she
spent
all
her
time
at
it
and
produced
a
blurred
effect
upon
strangers
the
only
man
with
whom
she
seemed
quite
alive
was
vanrevel
a
little
because
tom
talked
of
crailey
and
a
great
deal
because
she
could
talk
of
crailey
to
tom
could
tell
him
freely
as
she
could
tell
no
one
else
how
wonderful
crailey
was
and
explain
to
him
her
lover
vagaries
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
necessity
of
geniuses
to
be
unlike
the
less
gifted
nor
was
she
alone
in
suspecting
gray
of
genius
in
the
first
place
he
was
so
odd
in
the
second
his
poems
were
already
attracting
more
than
local
attention
as
the
journal
remarked
generously
for
crailey
had
ceased
to
present
his
rhymes
to
that
valuable
paper
ay
boston
no
less
was
his
mart
he
was
rather
radical
in
his
literary
preferences
and
hurt
the
elder
chenoweth
feelings
by
laughing
heartily
at
some
poems
of
the
late
lord
byron
offended
many
people
by
disliking
the
style
of
sir
edward
bulwer
and
even
refused
to
admit
that
james
fenimore
cooper
was
the
greatest
novelist
that
ever
lived
but
these
things
were
as
nothing
compared
with
his
unpatriotic
defence
of
charles
dickens
many
americans
had
fallen
into
a
great
rage
over
the
vivacious
assault
upon
the
united
states
in
martin
chuzzlewit
nevertheless
crailey
still
boldly
hailed
him
as
everyone
had
heretofore
agreed
the
most
dexterous
writer
of
his
day
and
the
most
notable
humorist
of
any
day
of
course
the
englishman
had
not
visited
and
thoroughly
studied
such
a
city
as
rouen
crailey
confessed
twinklingly
but
after
all
was
there
some
truth
in
martin
chuzzlewit
dickens
might
have
been
far
from
a
clear
understanding
of
our
people
but
did
it
argue
a
pretty
ticklish
vanity
in
ourselves
that
we
were
so
fiercely
resentful
of
satire
and
was
not
this
very
heat
over
martin
chuzzlewit
a
confirmation
of
one
of
the
points
the
book
had
presented
against
us
general
trumble
replied
to
this
suggestion
with
a
personal
one
to
the
effect
that
a
man
capable
of
saying
a
good
word
for
so
monstrous
a
slander
that
a
man
sir
capable
of
declaring
his
native
country
to
be
vain
or
sensitive
ought
to
be
horsewhipped
and
at
this
crailey
laughed
consumedly
trumble
retorted
with
the
names
of
benedict
arnold
and
aaron
burr
and
if
it
comes
to
a
war
with
these
greasers
he
spluttered
apoplectically
and
it
is
coming
mighty
soon
we
find
gray
down
in
mexico
throwing
mud
on
the
stars
and
stripes
and
cheering
for
that
santa
anna
anything
to
seek
out
something
foolish
amongst
your
own
people
do
have
to
seek
far
sometimes
general
murmured
crailey
from
the
depths
of
the
best
chair
in
the
club
whereupon
trumble
not
trusting
himself
to
answer
went
out
to
the
street
and
yet
before
that
same
evening
was
over
the
general
had
shed
honest
tears
of
admiration
and
pity
for
crailey
gray
and
miss
betty
saw
her
incroyable
again
for
that
night
the
second
after
the
carewe

beheld
the

not
the
last

of
his
kind
miss
carewe
was
at
her
desk
writing
to
sister
cecilia
whom
she
most
loved
of
all
the
world
when
the
bells
startled
her
with
their
sudden
clangor
the
quill
dropped
from
her
hand
she
started
to
her
feet
not
understanding
while
the
whole
town
drowsing
peacefully
a
moment
ago
resounded
immediately
with
a
loud
confusion
she
ran
to
the
front
door
and
looked
out
her
heart
beating
wildly
the
western
sky
was
touched
with
a
soft
which
quickly
became
a
warm
glow
fluctuated
and
in
the
instant
shot
up
like
the
coming
of
a
full
aurora
then
through
the
broken
foliage
of
the
treetops
could
be
seen
the
orange
curls
of
flames
of
a
mile
away
though
they
were
people
calling
loudly
that
it
was
carewe

were
running
down
the

galloping
and
seeing
the
white
figure
in

cried
out
in
a
quavering
voice
without
checking
his
steed
i
goin

he
in

missy
the
other
servants
like
ragged
sketches
in
the
night
flitted
by
with
excited
ejaculations
to
join
the
runners
and
miss
betty
followed
them
across
the
turf
in
her
night
slippers
but
at
the
gate
she
stopped
from
up
the
street
came
the
sound
of
a
bell
smaller
than
those
of
the
churches
and
courthouse
yet
one
that
outdid
all
others
in
the
madness
of
its
appeal
to
clear
the
way
it
was
borne
along
by
what
seemed
at
first
an
indefinite
black
mass
but
which
as
the
aurora
grew
keener
producing
even
here
a
faint
yellow
twilight
resolved
itself
into
a
mob
of
men
and
boys
who
were
running
and
tugging
at
ropes
which
drew
along
three
extraordinary
vehicles
they
came
rapidly
down
the
street
and
passed
miss
betty
with
a
hubbub
and
din
beyond
all
understanding
one
line
of
men
most
of
them
in
red
shirts
and
helmets
at
a
dead
run
with
the
a
second
line
with
the
the
third
dragging
the
one
man
was
riding
a
tall
straight
gentleman
in
evening
clothes
and
without
a
hat
who
stood
precariously
in
the
calling
in
an
annoyed
tone
through
a
brazen
trumpet
miss
betty
recognized
him
at
once
it
was
he
who
caught
her
kitten
and
she
thought
that
if
she
had
been
fanchon
bareaud
she
must
have
screamed
a
warning
for
his
balance
appeared
a
thing
of
mere
luck
and
if
he
fell
he
would
be
trampled
under
foot
and
probably
run
over
by
the
engine
but
happily
she
remembered
she
was
not
fanchon
bareaud
before
behind
and
beside
the
department
raced
a
throng
of
boys
wild
with
the
joy
experienced
by
their
species
when
property
is
being
handsomely
destroyed
after
them
came
panting
women
holding
their
sides
and
gasping
with
the
effort
to
keep
up
with
the
flying
procession
miss
betty
trembled
for
she
had
never
seen
the
like
in
her
life
she
stood
close
to
the
hedge
and
let
them
go
by
then
she
turned
in
after
them
and
ran
like
a
fleet
young
deer
she
was
going
to
the
fire
over
all
the
uproar
could
be
heard
the
angry
voice
through
the
trumpet
calling
the
turns
of
the
streets
to
the
men
in
the
van
upbraiding
them
and
those
of
the
other
two
companies
impartially
and
few
of
his
hearers
denied
the
chief
his
right
to
express
some
chagrin
since
the
department
organized
a
and
this
its
first
fire
worth
the
name
was
late
on
account
of
the
refusal
of
the
members
to
move
until
they
had
donned
their
new
uniforms
for
the

arrived
from

for
the
turn
they
swung
out
of
the
thick
shadows
of

into
full
view
of
the
fire
and
their
faces
were
illuminated
as
by
sunrise
the
warehouses
stood
on
the
at
the
foot
of
the
street
just
south
of

were
four
of

huge
buildings

nearer
the

of

the
others
of

and
all
of
them
rich
with
stores
of
every
kind
of
and
costly
freight
furniture
that
had
voyaged
from
new
england
down
the
long
coast
across
the

through
the
flat

and
had
made

almost
a
thousand

upon
which
they
had
been
landed
and
the

that
brought
them
up
the
rouen
river
belonged
to
robert
carewe
that
it
was
her
father
property
which
was
imperilled
attested
to
the
justification
of
miss
betty
in
running
to
a
fire
and
as
she
followed
the
crowd
into
main
street
she
felt
a
not
unpleasant
proprietary
interest
in
the
spectacle
very
opposite
sensations
animated
the
breast
of
the
man
with
the
trumpet
who
was
more
acutely
conscious
than
any
other
that
these
were
robert
carewe
possessions
which
were
burning
so
handsomely
nor
was
he
the
only
one
among
the
firemen
who
ground
his
teeth
over
the
folly
of
the
uniforms
for
now
they
could
plainly
see
the
ruin
being
wrought
the
devastation
threatened
the
two
upper
stories
of
the
southernmost
warehouse
had
swathed
themselves
in
one
great
flame
the
building
next
on
the
north
also
of
frame
was
smoking
heavily
and
there
was
a
wind
from
the
southwest
which
continuing
with
the
fire
unchecked
threatened
the
town
itself
there
was
work
for
the
volunteer
brigade
that
night
they
came
down
main
street
with
a
rush
the
figure
of
their
chief
swaying
over
them
on
his
high
perch
while
their
shouting
was
drowned
in
the
louder
roar
of
greeting
from
the
crowd
into
which
they
plunged
as
a
diver
into
the
water
swirls
and
eddies
of
people
marking
the
wake
a
moment
later
a
section
of
the
roof
of
the
burning
warehouse
fell
in
with
a
sonorous
and
reverberating
crash
the
engine
company
ran
the
out
to
the
end
of
one
of
the
lower
wharves
two
lines
of
pipe
were
attached
two
rows
of
men
mounted
the
planks
for
the
pumpers
and
at
the
word
of
command
began
the
of
the
with
admirable
vim
nothing
happened
the
water
did
not
come
something
appeared
to
be
wrong
with
the
mechanism
as
everyone
felt
the
crucial
need
of
haste
nothing
could
have
been
more
natural
than
that
all
the
members
of
the
engine
company
should
simultaneously
endeavor
to
repair
the
defect
therefore
ensued
upon
the
spot
a
species
of
riot
which
put
the
engine
out
of
its
sphere
of
usefulness
in
the
meantime
fifty
or
sixty
men
and
boys
who
ran
with
the
machines
but
who
had
no
place
in
their
operation
being
the
bucket
brigade
had
formed
a
line
and
were
throwing
large
pails
of
water
in
the
general
direction
of
the
southernmost
warehouse
which
it
was
now
impossible
to
save
while
the
gentlemen
of
the
company
abandoning
their
wagons
and
armed
with
axes
heroically
assaulted
the
big
door
of
the
granary
the
second
building
whence
they
were
driven
by
the
exasperated
chief
who
informed
them
that
the
only
way
to
save
the
wheat
was
to
save
the
building
crailey
gray
one
of
the
berated
axemen
remained
by
the
shattered
door
after
the
others
had
gone
and
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
set
his
hand
upon
the
iron
latch
and
opened
the
door
by
this
simple
process
it
was
not
locked
crailey
leaned
against
the
casement
and
laughed
with
his
whole
soul
and
body
meanwhile
by
dint
of
shouting
in
men
ears
when
near
them
through
the
trumpet
when
distant
tearing
axes
from
their
hands
imperiously
gesticulating
to
subordinate
commanders
and
lingering
in
no
one
spot
for
more
than
a
second
vanrevel
reduced
his
forces
to
a
semblance
of
order
in
a
remarkably
short
time
considering
the
confusion
into
which
they
had
fallen
the
space
between
the
burning
warehouse
and
that
next
it
was
not
more
than
fifty
feet
in
width
but
fifty
feet
so
hot
no
one
took
thought
of
entering
there
an
area
as
discomfiting
in
appearance
as
it
was
beautiful
with
the
thick
rain
of
sparks
and
firebrands
that
fell
upon
it
but
the
chief
had
decided
that
this
space
must
be
occupied
and
more
must
be
held
since
it
was
the
only
point
of
defence
for
the
second
warehouse
the
roof
of
this
building
would
burn
which
would
mean
the
destruction
of
the
warehouse
unless
it
could
be
mounted
because
the
streams
of
water
could
not
play
upon
it
from
the
ground
nor
from
the
ladders
do
much
more
than
wet
the
projecting
eaves
it
was
a
gable
roof
the
eaves
twenty
feet
lower
on
the
south
side
than
on
the
north
where
the
ladders
could
not
hope
to
reach
them
vanrevel
swung
his
line
of
bucketeers
round
to
throw
water
not
upon
the
flames
but
upon
the
miss
carewe
stood
in
the
crowd
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
broad
street
even
there
her
cheeks
were
uncomfortably
hot
and
sometimes
she
had
to
brush
a
spark
from
her
shoulder
though
she
was
too
much
excited
to
mind
this
she
was
watching
the
beautiful
fiery
furnace
between
the
north
wall
of
the
burning
warehouse
and
the
south
wall
of
its
neighbor
the
fifty
feet
brilliant
and
misty
with
vaporous
dotted
with
the
myriad
red
stars
her
eyes
shining
with
the
reflection
of
their
fierce
beauty
she
saw
how
the
vapors
moved
there
like
men
walking
in
fire
and
she
was
vaguely
recalling
shadrach
meshach
and
when
over
the
silhouetted
heads
of
the
crowd
before
her
a
long
black
ladder
rose
wobbled
tilted
crazily
then
lamely
advanced
and
ranged
itself
against
the
south
wall
of
the
second
warehouse
its
top
rung
striking
ten
feet
short
of
the
eaves
she
hoped
that
no
one
had
any
notion
of
mounting
that
ladder
a
figure
appeared
upon
it
immediately
that
of
a
gentleman
bareheaded
and
in
evening
dress
with
a
brass
trumpet
swinging
from
a
cord
about
his
shoulders
the
noise
grew
less
the
shouting
died
away
and
the
crowd
became
almost
silent
as
the
figure
climbing
slowly
drew
up
above
their
heads
two
or
three
rungs
beneath
came
a
second
a
man
in
helmet
and
uniform
the
clothes
of
both
men
drenched
by
the
bucketeers
clung
to
them
steaming
as
the
second
figure
mounted
a
third
appeared
but
this
was
the
last
for
the
ladder
was
frail
and
sagged
toward
the
smoking
wall
with
the
weight
of
the
three
the
chief
of
the
way
to
the
top
shouted
down
a
stifled
command
and
a
short
fitted
at
one
end
with
a
pair
of
spiked
iron
hooks
was
passed
to
him
then
he
toiled
upward
until
his
feet
rested
on
the
third
rung
from
the
top
here
he
turned
setting
his
back
to
the
wall
lifted
the
high
over
his
head
so
that
it
rested
against
the
eaves
above
him
and
brought
it
down
sharply
fastening
the
spiked
hooks
in
the
roof
as
the
eaves
projected
fully
three
feet
this
left
the
hanging
that
distance
out
from
the
wall
its
lowest
rung
a
little
above
the
level
of
the
shoulders
miss
betty
drew
in
her
breath
with
a
little
choked
cry
there
was
a
small
terraced
hill
of
near
her
possession
of
which
had
been
taken
by
a
company
of
raggamuffinish
boys
and
she
found
herself
standing
on
the
highest
box
and
sharing
the
summit
with
these
questionable
youths
almost
without
noting
her
action
in
mounting
thither
so
strained
was
the
concentration
of
her
attention
upon
the
figure
high
up
in
the
against
the
warehouse
wall
the
man
surely
surely
was
not
going
to
trust
himself
to
that
bit
of
wooden
web
hanging
from
the
roof
where
was
miss
bareaud
that
she
permitted
it
ah
if
betty
had
been
fanchon
and
madwoman
enough
to
have
accepted
this
madman
she
would
have
compelled
him
to
come
down
at
once
and
thereafter
would
lock
him
up
in
the
house
whenever
the
bells
rang
but
the
roof
was
to
be
mounted
or
robert
carewe
property
lost
already
little
flames
were
dancing
up
from
the
shingles
where
firebrands
had
fallen
their
number
increasing
with
each
second
so
vanrevel
raised
his
arms
took
a
hard
grip
upon
the
lowest
rung
of
the
and
tried
it
with
his
weight
the
iron
hooks
bit
deeper
into
the
roof
they
held
he
swung
himself
out
into
the
air
with
nothing
beneath
him
caught
the
rung
under
his
knee
and
for
a
moment
hung
there
while
the
crowd
withheld
from
breathing
then
a
cloud
of
smoke
swirling
that
way
made
him
the
mere
ghostly
nucleus
of
himself
blotted
him
out
altogether
and
as
it
rose
slowly
upward
showed
the
ladder
free
and
empty
so
that
at
first
there
was
an
instant
when
they
thought
that
he
had
fallen
but
as
the
smoke
cleared
there
was
the
tall
figure
on
the
roof
it
was
an
agile
and
daring
thing
to
do
and
the
man
who
did
it
was
mightily
applauded
the
cheering
bothered
him
however
for
he
was
trying
to
make
them
understand
below
what
would
happen
to
the
engine
company
in
case
the
water
was
not
sent
through
the
lines
directly
and
what
he
said
should
be
done
to
the
engineers
included
things
that
would
have
blanched
the
cheek
of
the
most
inventive
spanish
inquisitor
that
ever
lived
miss
betty
made
a
gesture
as
if
to
a
person
within
whispering
distance
your
coat
is
on
fire
she
said
in
an
ordinary
conversational
tone
without
knowing
she
had
spoken
aloud
and
vanrevel
more
than
one
hundred
feet
away
seemed
particularly
conscious
of
the
pertinence
of
her
remark
he
removed
the
garment
with
alacrity
and
for
the
lack
of
the
tardy
water
began
to
use
it
as
a
flail
upon
the
firebrands
and
little
flames
about
him
the
sheer
desperate
best
of
a
man
in
a
rage
doing
what
he
could
when
others
failed
him
showers
of
sparks
fell
upon
him
the
smoke
was
rising
everywhere
from
the
roof
and
the
walls
below
and
growing
denser
and
denser
shrouded
him
in
heavy
veils
so
that
as
he
ran
hither
and
thither
now
visible
now
unseen
stamping
and
beating
and
sweeping
away
the
brands
that
fell
he
seemed
but
the
red
and
ghostly
caricature
of
a
xerxes
ineffectually
lashing
the
sea
they
were
calling
to
him
imploringly
to
come
down
in
heaven
name
to
come
down
the
second
man
had
followed
to
the
top
of
the
ladder
against
the
wall
and
there
he
paused
waiting
to
pass
up
the
line
of
hose
when
the
word
should
come
that
the
had
been
repaired
but
the
people
thought
that
he
waited
because
he
was
afraid
to
trust
himself
to
the
he
was
afraid
exceedingly
afraid
though
that
was
not
why
he
waited
and
he
was
still
chuckling
over
the
assault
of
the
axes
his
situation
had
not
much
the
advantage
of
that
of
the
chief
his
red
shirt
might
have
been
set
with
orange
jewels
so
studded
it
was
with
the
flying
sparks
and
a
large
brand
dropping
upon
his
helmet
he
threw
up
his
hand
to
dislodge
it
and
lost
the
helmet
the
great
light
fell
upon
his
fair
hair
and
smiling
face
and
it
was
then
that
miss
betty
recognized
the
incroyable
of
her
garden
chapter
vi
the
ever
unpractical
feminine
it
was
an
investigating
negro
child
of
tender
years
who
possessed
of
a
petty
sense
of
cause
and
effect
brought
an
illuminative
simplicity
to
bear
upon
the
problem
of
the
and
a
multitudinous
agitation
greeted
his
discovery
that
the
engineers
had
forgotten
to
connect
their
pipes
with
the
river
this
naive
omission
was
fatal
to
the
second
warehouse
the
wall
burst
into
flame
below
crailey
gray
who
clung
to
the
top
of
the
ladder
choking
stifled
and
dizzily
fighting
the
sparks
that
covered
him
yet
still
clutching
the
nozzle
of
the
they
had
passed
to
him
when
the
stream
at
last
leaped
forth
making
the
nozzle
fight
in
his
grasp
he
sent
it
straight
up
into
the
air
and
let
the
cataract
fall
back
upon
himself
and
upon
the
two
men
beneath
him
on
the
ladder
there
came
a
moment
of
blessed
relief
and
he
looked
out
over
the
broad
rosy
blur
of
faces
in
the
street
where
no
one
wondered
more
than
he
how
the
water
was
to
reach
the
roof
suddenly
he
started
wiped
his
eyes
with
his
wet
sleeve
and
peered
intently
down
from
under
the
shading
arm
his
roving
glance
crossed
the
smoke
and
flame
to
rest
upon
a
tall
white
figure
that
stood
above
the
heads
of
the
people
upon
a
pedestal
wrought
with
the
grotesque
images
of
boys
a
girl
figure
still
as
noon
enrapt
like
the
statue
of
some
young
goddess
for
whom
were
made
these
sacrificial
pyres
gray
recognized
his
opportunity
a
blackened
and
unrecognizable
face
peered
down
from
the
eaves
and
the
voice
belonging
to
it
said
angrily
why
did
they
send
up
that
line
before
they
put
the
water
through
it
never
mind
tom
answered
crailey
cheerfully
i
bring
it
you
ca
i
come
down
for
it
do
be
every
kind
of
a
fool
you
want
a
monopoly
do
you
and
crailey
calling
to
tappingham
marsh
next
below
him
to
come
higher
left
the
writhing
nozzle
in
the
possession
swung
himself
out
upon
the
imitating
the
chief
gymnastics
and
immediately
one
hand
grasping
the
second
rung
one
knee
crooked
over
the
lowest
leaned
head
down
and
took
the
nozzle
from
marsh
it
was
a
heavy
weight
and
though
marsh
supported
the
line
beneath
it
the
great
stream
hurtling
forth
made
it
a
difficult
thing
to
manage
for
it
wriggled
recoiled
and
struggled
as
if
it
had
been
alive
crailey
made
three
attempts
to
draw
himself
up
but
the
strain
was
too
much
for
his
grip
and
on
the
third
attempt
his
fingers
melted
from
the
rung
and
he
swung
down
fearfully
hanging
by
his
knee
but
still
clinging
to
the
nozzle
give
it
up
crailey
it
is
worth
it
vanrevel
called
from
overhead
not
daring
the
weight
of
both
on
the
light
but
though
crailey
cared
no
more
for
the
saving
of
robert
property
than
for
a
butterfly
wing
in
china
he
could
not
give
up
now
any
more
than
as
a
lad
he
could
have
forborne
to
turn
somersaults
when
the
prettiest
little
girl
looked
out
of
the
window
he
passed
the
nozzle
to
tappingham
caught
the
second
rung
with
his
left
hand
and
once
more
hanging
head
downward
seized
the
nozzle
then
with
his
knee
hooked
tight
as
the
gushing
water
described
a
huge
semicircle
upon
the
smoke
and
hot
vapor
he
made
a
mad
lurch
through
the
air
while
women
shrieked
but
he
landed
upright
on
the
lowest
rung
he
climbed
the
swiftly
in
spite
of
the
weight
and
contortions
of
the
unmanageable
beast
he
carried
with
him
tom
leaned
far
down
and
took
it
from
him
and
crailey
passing
the
eaves
fell
exhausted
upon
the
roof
just
as
he
reached
this
temporary
security
a
lady
was
borne
fainting
out
of
the
acclaiming
crowd
fanchon
was
there
word
had
been
passed
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
engine
company
to
shut
off
the
water
in
order
to
allow
the
line
to
be
carried
up
the
ladder
and
they
received
the
command
at
the
moment
tom
lifted
the
nozzle
so
that
the
stream
dried
up
in
his
hands
this
was
the
last
straw
and
the
blackened
singed
and
scarred
chief
setting
the
trumpet
to
his
lips
gave
himself
entirely
to
wrath
it
struck
crailey
even
as
he
lay
coughing
and
weeping
with
smoke
that
there
was
something
splendid
and
large
in
the
other
rage
vanrevel
was
ordinarily
so
steady
and
cool
that
this
was
worth
seeing
this
berserker
gesture
worth
hearing
this
wonderful
profanity
like
washington
one
fit
of
cursing
and
crailey
knowing
tom
knew
too
that
it
had
not
come
upon
him
because
carewe
had
a
daughter
into
whose
eyes
tom
had
looked
nor
did
he
rage
because
he
believed
that
crailey
life
and
his
were
in
the
greater
hazard
for
the
lack
of
every
drop
of
water
that
should
have
issued
from
the
empty
nozzle
their
lungs
were
burdened
with
smoke
while
the
intolerable
smarting
of
throat
eyes
and
nostrils
was
like
the
incision
of
a
thousand
needles
in
the
membranes
their
clothes
were
luminous
with
glowing
circles
where
the
sparks
were
eating
the
blaze
widened
on
the
wall
beneath
them
and
marsh
was
shouting
hoarsely
that
he
could
no
longer
hold
his
position
on
the
ladder
yet
crailey
knew
that
none
of
this
was
in
tom
mind
as
he
stood
scorched
blistered
and
haggard
on
the
edge
of
the
roof
shaking
his
fist
at
the
world
it
was
because
his
chance
of
saving
the
property
of
a
man
he
despised
was
being
endangered
crailey
stretched
forth
a
hand
and
touched
his
friend
knee
your
side
of
the
conversation
is
a
trifle
loud
tom
he
said
miss
carewe
is
down
there
across
the
street
on
a
pile
of
tom
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
word
for
which
he
may
have
received
but
half
a
black
stroke
from
the
recording
angel
he
wheeled
toward
the
street
and
shielding
his
inflamed
eyes
with
his
hand
gazed
downward
in
a
stricken
silence
from
that
moment
vanrevel
instructions
to
his
followers
were
of
a
decorum
at
which
not
the
meekest
scholar
dare
have
cavilled
the
three
men
now
on
the
long
ladder
marsh
eugene
madrillon
and
will
cummings
found
their
position
untenable
for
the
flames
reaching
all
along
the
wall
were
licking
at
the
ladder
itself
between
marsh
and
eugene
i
ca
stand
this
any
longer
gasped
tappingham
but
i
leave
those
two
up
there
not
alone
shouted
cummings
from
beneath
madrillon
let
go
thus
it
happened
that
when
the
water
came
again
and
vanrevel
let
it
fall
in
a
grateful
cascade
upon
crailey
and
himself
three
manly
voices
were
heard
singing
as
three
men
toiled
through
the
billows
of
rosy
gray
below
the
beleaguered
pair
oh
the
noble
duke
of
york
he
had
ten
thousand
men
he
marched
them
up
the
side
of
a
house
and
marched
them
down
again
a
head
appeared
above
the
eaves
and
marsh
then
eugene
then
cummings
came
crawling
over
the
cornice
in
turn
to
join
their
comrades
they
were
a
gallant
band
those
young
gentlemen
of
rouen
and
they
came
with
the
ironical
song
on
their
lips
and
looking
at
one
another
ragged
and
scarified
burst
into
hoarse
but
indomitable
laughter
two
others
made
an
attempt
to
follow
and
would
not
be
restrained
it
was
noticed
that
parts
of
the
lower
ladder
had
been
charring
and
the
were
preparing
to
remove
it
to
a
less
dangerous
point
when
old
general
trumble
and
young
jefferson
bareaud
made
a
rush
to
mount
it
and
were
well
upon
their
upward
way
before
the
ladder
weakened
at
the
middle
sagged
splintered
and
broke
trumble
and
bareaud
falling
with
it
and
there
was
the
dangling
forty
feet
above
the
ground
and
there
were
the
five
upon
the
roof
the
department
had
no
other
ladder
of
more
than
half
the
length
of
the
shattered
one
not
only
the
department
but
every
soul
in
rouen
knew
that
and
there
rose
the
thick
low
sigh
of
a
multitude
a
sound
frightful
to
hear
it
became
a
groan
then
swelled
into
a
deep
cry
of
alarm
and
lamentation
and
now
almost
simultaneously
the
west
wall
of
the
building
and
the
south
wall
and
all
the
southwestern
portions
of
the
roof
covered
with
voluminous
mantles
of
flame
which
increased
so
hugely
and
with
such
savage
rapidity
that
the
one
stream
on
the
roof
was
seen
to
be
but
a
ridiculous
and
useless
opposition
everybody
began
to
shout
advice
to
his
neighbor
and
nobody
listened
even
to
himself
the
firemen
were
in
as
great
a
turmoil
as
was
the
crowd
while
women
covered
their
eyes
young
frank
chenoweth
was
sobbing
curses
upon
the
bruised
and
shaking
trumble
and
jefferson
bareaud
who
could
only
stand
remorseful
impotently
groaning
and
made
no
answer
the
walls
of
the
southernmost
warehouse
followed
the
roof
crashing
inward
one
after
the
other
a
sacrificial
pyre
with
its
purpose
consummated
and
in
the
seeth
and
flare
of
its
passing
tom
vanrevel
again
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
looked
down
across
the
upturned
faces
the
pedestal
with
the
grotesque
carvings
was
still
there
but
the
crowning
figure
had
disappeared
the
young
goddess
was
gone
for
she
of
all
that
throng
had
an
idea
in
her
head
and
after
screaming
it
to
every
man
within
reach
only
to
discover
the
impossibility
of
making
herself
understood
in
that
babel
she
was
struggling
to
make
her
way
toward
the
second
warehouse
through
the
swaying
jam
of
people
it
was
a
difficult
task
as
the
farther
in
she
managed
to
go
the
denser
became
the
press
and
the
more
tightly
she
found
the
people
wedged
until
she
received
involuntary
aid
from
the
firemen
in
turning
their
second
stream
to
play
ineffectually
upon
the
lower
strata
of
flame
they
accidentally
deflected
it
toward
the
crowd
who
separated
wildly
leaving
a
big
gap
of
which
miss
betty
took
instant
advantage
she
darted
across
and
the
next
moment
unnoticed
had
entered
the
building
through
the
door
which
crailey
gray
had
opened
the
five
young
men
on
the
roof
were
well
aware
that
there
was
little
to
do
but
to
wait
and
soon
they
would
see
which
was
to
win
they
or
the
fire
so
they
shifted
their
line
of
hose
to
the
eastern
front
of
the
building
out
of
harm
way
for
a
little
time
at
least
and
held
the
muzzle
steady
watching
its
work
and
in
truth
it
was
not
long
before
they
understood
which
would
conquer
the
southern
and
western
portions
of
the
building
had
flung
out
great
flames
that
fluttered
and
flared
on
the
breeze
like
titanic
flags
and
steadily
slowly
at
first
then
faster
as
the
seconds
flew
the
five
were
driven
backward
up
the
low
slope
of
the
roof
toward
the
tom
vanrevel
held
the
first
joint
of
the
nozzle
and
he
retreated
with
a
sulky
face
lifting
his
foot
grudgingly
at
each
step
they
were
all
silent
now
and
no
one
spoke
until
will
cummings
faltered
surely
they
get
a
rope
up
to
us
some
way
will
knew
as
well
as
did
the
others
that
there
was
no
way
but
his
speech
struck
the
sullen
heart
of
the
chief
with
remorse
he
turned
i
hope
you
all
forgive
me
for
getting
you
up
a
sound
half
sob
half
giggle
came
from
the
parched
lips
of
eugene
madrillon
as
he
patted
tom
on
the
shoulder
without
speaking
and
crailey
nodded
quietly
then
left
the
group
and
went
to
the
eastern
edge
of
the
roof
and
looked
out
upon
the
crowd
cummings
dropped
the
line
and
sat
down
burying
his
hot
face
in
his
arms
for
they
all
saw
that
vanrevel
thought
it
was
no
use
but
a
question
of
a
few
minutes
and
they
would
retreat
across
the
gable
and
either
jump
or
go
down
with
the
roof
since
the
world
began
idle
and
industrious
philosophers
have
speculated
much
upon
the
thoughts
of
men
about
to
die
yet
it
can
not
be
too
ingenuous
to
believe
that
such
thoughts
vary
as
the
men
their
characters
and
conditions
of
life
vary
nevertheless
pursuant
with
the
traditions
of
minstrelsy
and
romance
it
is
conceivable
that
young
unmarried
men
called
upon
to
face
desperate
situations
might
at
the
crucial
moment
rush
to
a
common
experience
of
summoning
the
vision
each
of
his
heart
desire
and
to
meet
each
his
doom
with
her
name
upon
his
lips
an
extraordinary
thing
occurred
in
the
present
instance
for
by
means
of
some
fragmentary
remarks
let
fall
at
the
time
and
afterward
recalled
such
as
tappingham
marsh
gasping
at
least
it
will
be
on
her
roof
and
from
other
things
later
overheard
an
inevitable
deduction
has
been
reached
that
four
of
the
five
gentlemen
in
the
perilous
case
herein
described
were
occupied
with
the
vision
of
the
same
person
to
wit
miss
elizabeth
carewe
the
last
the
prettiest
to
come
to
town
crailey

alone
spoke
not
at
all
but
why
did
he
strain
and
strain
his
eyes
toward
that
empty
pedestal
with
the
grotesque
carvings
did
he
seek
fanchon
there
or
was
miss
carewe
the
last
sweet
apparition
in
the
fancies
of
all
five
of
the
unhappy
young
men
the
coincidence
of
the
actual
appearance
of
the
lady
among
them
therefore
seemed
the
more
miraculous
when
wan
and
hopeless
staggering
desperately
backward
to
the
they
heard
a
clear
contralto
voice
behind
them
had
you
better
all
come
down
now
it
the
stairway
will
be
on
fire
before
only
one
thing
could
have
been
more
shockingly
unexpected
to
the
five
than
that
there
should
be
a
sixth
person
on
the
roof
and
this
was
that
the
sixth
person
should
be
miss
betty
carewe
they
turned
aghast
agape
chopfallen
with
astonishment
stunned
and
incredulous
she
stood
just
behind
the
smiling
amiably
a
most
incongruous
little
pink
fan
in
her
hand
the
partly
obscuring
her
and
curling
between
the
five
and
her
white
dress
like
mists
floating
across
the
new
moon
was
it
but
a
kindly
phantasm
of
the
brain
was
it
the
incarnation
of
the
last
vision
of
the
lost
volunteers
was
it
a
valkyrie
assuming
that
lovely
likeness
to
perch
upon
this
eyrie
waiting
to
bear
their
heroic
souls
to
valhalla
or
was
it
miss
betty
carewe
to
the
chief
she
spoke
all
of
them
agreed
to
that
afterward
but
it
was
crailey
who
answered
while
tom
could
only
stare
and
stand
wagging
his
head
at
the
lovely
phantom
like
a
mandarin
on
a
shelf
my
mother
in
heaven
gasped
crailey
how
did
you
come
up
here
there
a
trap
in
the
roof
on
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
she
said
and
she
began
to
fan
herself
with
the
pink
fan
a
stairway
runs
all
the
way
down
old
nelson
showed
me
through
these
buildings
yesterday
and
that
side
is
on
fire
yet
i
so
sorry
i
did
think
of
it
until
a
moment
ago
because
you
could
have
brought
the
water
up
that
way
but
do
you
think
you
better
come
down
now
chapter
vii
the
comedian
not
savage
hun
nor
barbarous
vandyke
nor
demon
apache
could
wish
to
dwell
upon
the
state
of
mind
of
the
chief
of
the
rouen
volunteer
fire
department
therefore
let
the
curtain
of
mercy
descend
without
a
word
he
turned
and
dragged
the
nozzle
to
the
eastern
eaves
whence
after
a
warning
gesture
to
those
below
he
dropped
it
to
the
ground
and
out
of
compassion
it
should
be
little
more
than
hinted
that
the
gesture
of
warning
was
very
slight
when
the
rescued
band
reached
the
foot
of
the
last
flight
of
stairs
they
beheld
the
open
doorway
as
a
frame
for
a
great
press
of
intent
and
faces
every
eye
still
strained
to
watch
the
roof
none
of
the
harrowed
spectators
comprehending
the
appearance
of
the
figure
there
nor
able
to
see
whither
she
had
led
the
five
young
men
until
tappingham
marsh
raised
a
shout
as
he
leaped
out
of
the
door
and
danced
upon
the
solid
earth
again
then
indeed
there
was
a
mighty
uproar
cheer
after
cheer
ascended
to
the
red
vault
of
heaven
women
wept
men
whooped
and
the
people
rushed
for
the
heroes
with
welcoming
arms
jefferson
bareaud
and
frank
chenoweth
and
general
trumble
dashed
at
tom
vanrevel
with
incoherent
cries
of
thanksgiving
shaking
his
hands
and
beating
him
hysterically
upon
the
back
he
greeted
them
with
bitter
laughter
help
get
the
water
into
the
next
warehouse
this
one
is
beyond
control
but
we
can
save
the
other
two
take
the
lines
in
through
the
door
he
brushed
the
rejoicing
friends
off
abruptly
and
went
on
in
a
queer
hollow
voice
there
are
stairs
and
i
so
sorry
i
did
think
of
it
until
a
moment
ago
because
you
could
have
brought
the
water
up
that
way
a
remarkable
case
of
desertion
had
occurred
the
previous
instant
under
his
eyes
as
the
party
emerged
from
the
warehouse
into
the
street
tom
heard
crailey
say
hurriedly
to
miss
carewe
let
me
get
you
away
come
quickly
saw
him
suddenly
seize
her
band
and
eluding
the
onrushing
crowd
run
with
her
round
the
corner
of
the
building
and
somehow
through
what
inspiration
or
through
what
knowledge
of
his
temperament
heaven
knows
the
prophetic
soul
of
the
chief
was
unhappily
assured
that
crailey
would
offer
himself
as
escort
to
her
home
and
find
acceptance
but
why
not
was
it
crailey
who
had
publicly
called
his
fool
idiot
imbecile
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
only
to
find
himself
the
proven
numskull
of
the
universe
tom
stood
for
a
moment
staring
after
the
vanishing
pair
while
over
his
face
stole
the
strangest
expression
that
ever
man
saw
there
then
with
meekly
bowed
shoulders
he
turned
again
to
his
work
at
the
corner
of
the
warehouse
miss
carewe
detached
her
hand
from
crailey
yet
still
followed
him
as
he
made
a
quick
detour
round
the
next
building
a
minute
or
two
later
they
found
themselves
undetected
upon
main
street
in
the
rear
of
the
crowd
there
crailey
paused
forgive
me
he
said
breathlessly
for
taking
your
hand
i
thought
you
would
like
to
get
she
regarded
him
gravely
so
that
he
found
it
difficult
to
read
her
look
except
that
it
was
seriously
questioning
but
whether
the
interrogation
was
addressed
to
him
or
to
herself
he
could
not
determine
after
a
silence
she
said
i
do
know
why
i
followed
you
i
believe
it
must
have
been
because
you
did
give
me
time
to
this
of
course
made
him
even
quicker
with
her
than
before
it
all
over
he
said
briskly
the
first
warehouse
is
gone
the
second
will
go
but
they
save
the
others
easily
enough
now
that
you
have
pointed
out
that
the
lines
may
be
utilized
otherwise
than
as
adjuncts
of
performances
on
the
high
trapeze
they
were
standing
by
a
and
he
leaned
against
it
overcome
by
mirth
in
which
she
did
not
join
her
gravity
reacted
upon
him
at
once
and
his
laughter
was
stopped
short
will
you
not
accept
me
as
an
escort
to
your
home
he
said
formally
i
do
not
know
she
returned
simply
the
sort
of
honest
trouble
in
her
glance
that
is
seen
only
in
very
young
eyes
reason
in
the
world
he
returned
with
a
crafty
sharpness
of
astonishment
she
continued
to
gaze
upon
him
thoughtfully
while
he
tried
to
look
into
her
eyes
but
was
baffled
because
the
radiant
beams
from
the
lady
orbs
as
the
elder
chenoweth
might
have
said
rested
somewhere
dangerously
near
his
chin
which
worried
him
for
though
his
chin
made
no
retreat
and
was
far
from
it
was
nevertheless
that
feature
which
he
most
distrusted
wo
you
tell
me
why
not
he
repeated
uneasily
because
she
answered
at
last
speaking
hesitatingly
because
it
is
so
easy
a
matter
for
me
as
you
seem
to
think
you
have
not
been
introduced
to
me
and
i
know
you
never
will
be
and
that
what
you
told
me
was
which
part
of
what
i
told
you
the
question
escaped
from
him
instantly
that
the
others
might
come
when
they
liked
but
that
you
could
oh
yes
his
expression
altered
to
a
sincere
dejection
his
shoulders
drooped
and
his
voice
indicated
supreme
annoyance
i
might
have
known
someone
would
tell
you
who
was
it
did
they
say
why
i
on
account
of
your
quarrel
with
my
my
quarrel
with
your
father
he
exclaimed
and
his
face
lit
with
an
elated
surprise
his
shoulders
straightened
he
took
a
step
nearer
her
and
asked
eagerly
who
told
you
that
my
father
himself
he
spoke
of
a
vanrevel
whom
he
disliked
and
whom
i
must
not
meet
and
remembering
what
you
had
said
of
course
i
knew
that
you
were
oh
crailey
lips
began
to
form
a
smile
of
such
appealing
and
inimitable
sweetness
that
voltaire
would
have
trusted
him
a
smile
then
i
lose
you
he
said
for
my
only
chance
to
know
you
was
in
keeping
it
hidden
from
you
and
now
you
understand
no
she
answered
gravely
i
do
understand
that
is
what
troubles
me
if
i
did
and
believed
you
had
the
right
of
the
difference
i
could
believe
it
no
sin
that
you
should
speak
to
me
should
take
me
home
now
i
think
it
is
wrong
not
to
act
from
your
own
understanding
of
the
young
man
set
his
expression
as
one
indomitably
fixed
upon
the
course
of
honor
cost
what
it
might
and
in
the
very
action
his
lurking
pleasure
in
doing
it
hopped
out
in
the
flicker
of
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
and
as
instantly
sought
cover
again
the
flea
in
the
then
you
must
ask
some
other
he
said
firmly
a
disinterested
person
should
tell
you
the
difference
was
political
in
the
beginning
but
became
personal
afterward
and
it
is
now
a
quarrel
which
can
never
be
patched
up
though
for
my
part
i
wish
that
it
could
be
i
can
say
no
more
because
a
party
to
it
should
not
she
met
his
level
look
squarely
at
last
and
no
man
ever
had
a
more
truthful
pair
of
eyes
than
crailey
gray
for
it
was
his
great
accomplishment
that
he
could
adjust
his
emotion
his
reason
and
something
that
might
be
called
his
faith
to
fit
any
situation
in
any
character
you
may
take
me
home
she
answered
i
may
be
wrong
and
even
disloyal
but
i
do
not
feel
it
so
now
you
did
a
very
brave
thing
tonight
to
save
him
from
loss
and
i
think
that
what
you
have
said
was
just
what
you
should
have
so
they
went
down
the
street
the
hubbub
and
confusion
of
the
fire
growing
more
and
more
indistinct
behind
them
they
walked
slowly
and
for
a
time
neither
spoke
yet
the
silence
was
of
a
kind
which
the
adept
rejoiced
to
have
produced
thus
soon
their
second
meeting
for
he
believed
there
were
more
strange
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
horatio
wot
and
one
of
the
strangest
was
that
whenever
he
was
near
an
attractive
woman
during
a
silence
such
as
this
something
not
to
be
defined
but
as
effective
as
it
was
indefinite
always
went
out
from
him
to
her
it
was
like
a
word
of
tenderness
a
word
too
gentle
too
compelling
too
sweet
to
be
part
of
any
tongue
spoken
or
written
and
more
this
ineffable
word
had
an
echo
and
came
back
to
him
from
the
woman
as
his
partner
had
in
dress
so
crailey
had
with
women
some
color
of
the
beau
but
it
was
not
in
what
experience
had
given
him
to
recognize
as
a
fact
that
they
were
apt
to
fall
in
love
with
him
that
they
were
apt
to
remain
in
love
with
him
he
understood
perfectly
was
another
matter
and
he
knew
when
they
were
doing
it
could
have
told
them
accurately
at
each
step
what
they
were
feeling
thinking
dreaming
during
the
process
because
he
was
usually
exhibiting
the
same
symptoms
to
himself
at
the
same
time
thus
his
own
breast
occupied
with
that
dizzy
elation
which
followed
its
reception
of
the
insane
young
god
arrows
and
his
heart
warm
with
the
rise
of
the
old
emotion
that
he
knew
so
well
he
was
nevertheless
able
to
walk
with
his
finger
on
the
pulse
of
the
exquisite
moment
counting
her
heartbeats
and
his
own
so
to
his
fancy
as
they
walked
the
little
space
between
them
was
hung
with
brilliant
strands
like
gossamer
chains
of
gold
already
linking
them
together
every
second
fixing
another
slender
precious
fetter
binding
them
closer
drawing
her
nearer
he
waited
until
they
passed
into
the
shadows
of
the
deserted
carewe
street
before
he
spoke
there
he
stopped
abruptly
at
which
she
turned
astonished
now
that
you
have
saved
my
life
he
said
in
a
low
tremulous
tone
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
her
eyes
opened
almost
as
widely
as
they
had
at
her
first
sight
of
him
in
her
garden
there
was
a
long
pause
before
she
replied
and
when
she
did
it
was
to
his
considerable
surprise
i
have
never
seen
a
play
except
the
funny
little
ones
we
acted
at
the
convent
she
said
but
is
that
the
way
they
speak
on
the
stage
crailey
realized
that
his
judgment
of
the
silence
bad
been
mistaken
and
yet
it
was
with
a
thrill
of
delight
that
he
recognized
her
clear
reading
of
him
he
had
been
too
florid
again
let
us
his
voice
was
soft
with
restrained
forgiveness
you
mocked
me
once
before
mocked
you
she
repeated
as
they
went
on
mocked
me
he
said
firmly
mocked
me
for
seeming
theatrical
and
yet
you
have
learned
that
what
i
said
was
true
as
you
will
she
mused
upon
this
then
as
in
whimsical
indulgence
to
an
importunate
child
well
tell
me
what
you
mean
when
you
say
i
saved
your
you
came
alone
he
began
hastily
to
stand
upon
that
burning
roof
whence
all
but
him
had
fled
her
laughter
rang
out
interrupting
him
my
room
was
on
the
fourth
floor
at
mary
and
i
did
mind
climbing
three
flights
this
crailey
was
always
perfect
you
mock
me
and
you
mock
me
he
cried
and
made
her
laughter
but
part
of
a
gay
duet
i
know
i
have
gone
too
fast
have
said
things
i
should
have
waited
to
say
but
ah
remember
the
small
chance
i
have
against
the
others
who
can
see
you
when
they
like
do
flout
me
because
i
try
to
make
the
most
of
a
rare
stolen
moment
with
do
she
exclaimed
grave
upon
the
instant
do
make
the
most
of
it
i
have
nothing
but
inexperience
make
the
most
by
treating
me
seriously
wo
you
i
know
you
can
and
i
i
she
faltered
to
a
full
stop
she
was
earnest
and
quiet
and
there
had
been
something
in
her
tone
too
as
very
often
there
was
that
showed
how
young
she
was
oh
she
began
again
turning
to
him
impulsively
i
have
thought
about
you
since
that
evening
in
the
garden
and
i
have
wished
i
could
know
you
i
ca
be
quite
clear
how
it
happened
but
even
those
few
minutes
left
a
number
of
strong
impressions
about
you
and
the
strongest
was
that
you
were
one
with
whom
i
could
talk
of
a
great
many
things
if
you
would
only
be
real
with
me
i
believe
though
i
not
sure
why
i
do
that
it
is
very
difficult
for
you
to
be
real
perhaps
because
you
are
so
different
at
different
times
that
you
are
sure
yourself
which
the
real
you
is
but
the
person
that
you
are
beginning
to
be
for
my
benefit
must
be
the
most
trifling
of
all
your
selves
lighter
and
easier
to
put
on
than
the
little
mask
you
carried
the
other
night
if
there
were
nothing
better
underneath
the
mask
i
might
play
did
you
learn
this
at
the
convent
gasped
crailey
there
was
a
world
there
in
miniature
she
answered
speaking
very
quickly
i
think
all
people
are
made
of
the
same
materials
only
in
such
different
proportions
i
think
a
little
world
might
hold
as
much
as
the
largest
if
you
thought
it
all
out
hard
enough
and
your
experience
might
be
just
as
broad
and
deep
in
a
small
corner
of
the
earth
as
anywhere
else
but
i
do
know
i
want
to
understand
i
want
to
understand
everything
i
read
books
and
there
are
people
but
no
one
who
tells
me
what
i
want
i
he
lifted
his
hand
i
wo
act
i
shall
never
for
you
he
was
breathless
the
witching
silence
was
nothing
to
what
stirred
him
now
a
singular
exaltation
rose
in
him
together
with
the
reckless
impulse
to
speak
from
the
mood
her
vehement
confidence
had
he
gave
way
to
it
i
know
i
know
he
said
huskily
i
understand
all
you
mean
all
you
feel
all
you
wish
it
is
all
echoing
here
and
here
and
here
he
touched
his
breast
his
eyes
and
his
forehead
with
the
fingers
of
his
long
and
slender
hand
we
sigh
and
strain
our
eyes
and
stretch
out
our
arms
in
the
dark
groping
always
for
the
strange
blessing
that
is
just
beyond
our
grasp
seeking
for
the
precious
unknown
that
lies
just
over
the
horizon
it
what
they
meant
by
the
pot
of
gold
where
the
rainbow
ends
only
it
may
be
there
after
all
they
stopped
unconsciously
and
remained
standing
at
the
lower
end
of
the
carewe
hedge
the
western
glow
had
faded
and
she
was
gazing
at
him
through
the
darkness
leaning
forward
never
dreaming
that
her
tight
grasp
had
broken
the
sticks
of
the
little
pink
fan
yes
she
whispered
eagerly
you
are
right
you
understand
he
went
on
the
words
coming
faster
and
faster
we
are
haunted
you
and
i
by
the
wish
to
know
all
things
and
by
the
question
that
lies
under
every
thought
we
have
the
agonizing
whither
is
it
like
that
it
is
really
death
that
makes
us
think
you
are
a
good
catholic
you
go
to
mass
but
you
wish
to
know
does
god
reign
or
did
it
all
happen
sometimes
it
seems
so
deadly
probable
that
the
universe
just
was
no
god
to
plan
it
nothing
but
things
that
we
die
as
sparrows
die
and
the
brain
is
all
the
soul
we
have
a
thing
that
becomes
clogged
and
stops
some
day
and
is
that
all
she
shivered
slightly
but
her
steadfast
eyes
did
not
shift
from
him
he
threw
back
his
head
and
his
face
uplifted
to
the
jewelled
sky
of
the
moonless
night
was
beatific
in
its
peacefulness
as
he
continued
in
an
altered
tone
gentle
and
low
i
think
all
questions
are
answered
there
the
stars
tell
it
all
when
you
look
at
them
you
know
they
have
put
them
on
our
flag
there
are
times
when
this
seems
but
a
poor
nation
boastful
corrupt
violent
and
preparing
as
it
is
now
to
steal
another
country
by
fraud
and
war
yet
the
stars
on
the
flag
always
make
me
happy
and
confident
do
you
see
the
constellations
swinging
above
us
such
unimaginable
vastnesses
not
roving
or
crashing
through
the
illimitable
at
haphazard
but
moving
in
more
excellent
measure
and
to
a
finer
rhythm
than
the
most
delicate
clockwork
man
ever
made
the
great
mark
our
seas
with
their
paths
through
the
water
the
fine
brains
of
the
earth
are
behind
the
ships
that
sail
from
port
to
port
yet
how
awry
the
system
goes
when
does
a
ship
come
to
her
harbor
at
an
hour
determined
when
she
sailed
what
is
a
ship
beside
the
smallest
moon
of
the
smallest
world
but
there
above
us
moons
worlds
suns
all
the
infinite
cluster
of
colossi
move
into
place
to
the
exactness
of
a
hair
at
the
precise
instant
that
instant
has
been
planned
you
see
it
is
part
of
a
system
and
can
a
system
exist
that
no
mind
made
think
of
the
mind
that
made
this
one
do
you
believe
so
inconceivably
majestic
an
intelligence
as
that
could
be
anything
but
good
ah
when
you
wonder
look
above
you
look
above
you
in
the
night
i
say
he
cried
his
hand
upraised
like
his
transfigured
face
look
above
you
and
you
will
never
fear
that
a
sparrow
fall
could
go
unmarked
it
was
not
to
the
stars
that
she
looked
but
to
the
orator
as
long
as
he
held
that
pose
which
lasted
until
a
horse
came
galloping
down
the
street
as
it
dashed
by
though
the
rider
looked
neither
to
right
nor
left
miss
betty
unconsciously
made
a
feverish
clutch
at
her
companion
sleeve
drawing
him
closer
to
the
hedge
it
is
my
father
she
said
hurriedly
in
a
low
voice
he
must
not
see
you
you
must
never
come
here
perhaps
she
paused
then
quickly
whispered
you
have
been
very
kind
to
me
he
looked
at
her
keenly
and
through
the
dimness
saw
that
her
face
was
shining
with
excitement
he
did
not
speak
again
but
taking
a
step
smiled
faintly
bent
his
head
in
humble
acquiescence
and
made
a
slight
gesture
of
his
hand
for
her
to
leave
him
she
set
her
eyes
upon
his
once
more
then
turned
swiftly
and
almost
ran
along
the
hedge
to
the
gate
but
there
she
stopped
and
looked
back
he
was
standing
where
she
had
left
him
his
face
again
uplifted
to
the
sky
she
waved
him
an
uncertain
farewell
and
ran
into
the
garden
both
palms
against
her
burning
cheeks
night
is
the
great
necromancer
and
strange
are
the
fabrics
he
weaves
he
lays
queer
spells
breathes
so
eerie
an
intoxication
through
the
dusk
he
can
cast
such
glamours
about
a
voice
he
is
the
very
king
of
fairyland
miss
betty
began
to
walk
rapidly
up
and
down
the
garden
paths
her
head
bent
and
her
bands
still
pressed
to
her
cheeks
now
and
then
an
unconscious
exclamation
burst
from
her
incoherent
more
like
a
gasp
than
a
word
a
long
time
she
paced
the
vigil
with
her
stirring
heart
her
skirts
sweeping
the
dew
from
the
leaning
flowers
her
lips
moved
often
but
only
the
confused
vehement
oh
oh
came
from
them
until
at
last
she
paused
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
away
from
the
trees
where
all
was
open
to
the
sparkling
firmament
and
extended
her
arms
over
her
head
o
strange
teacher
she
said
aloud
i
take
your
beautiful
stars
i
shall
know
how
to
learn
from
them
she
gazed
steadily
upward
enrapt
her
eyes
resplendent
with
their
own
starlight
oh
stars
stars
stars
she
whispered
in
the
teeth
of
all
wizardry
night
spells
do
pass
at
sunrise
marvellous
poems
sink
to
doggerel
mighty
dreams
to
blown
ashes
and
solids
regain
weight
miss
betty
waking
at
daybreak
saw
the
motes
dancing
in
the
sun
at
her
window
and
watched
them
with
a
placid
unremembering
eye
she
began
to
stare
at
them
in
a
puzzled
way
while
a
look
of
wonder
slowly
spread
over
her
face
suddenly
she
sat
upright
as
though
something
had
startled
her
her
fingers
clenched
tightly
ah
if
that
was
playing
chapter
viii
a
tale
of
a
political
difference
carewe
was
already
at
the
but
the
light
of
his
countenance
hidden
behind
the
rouen
journal
was
not
vouchsafed
to
his
daughter
when
she
took
her
place
opposite
him
nor
did
he
see
fit
to
return
her
morning
greeting
from
which
she
generously
concluded
that
the
burning
of
the
two
warehouses
had
meant
a
severe
loss
to
him
i
am
so
sorry
father
she
said
gently
she
had
not
called
him
papa
since
the
morning
after
her
ball
i
hope
it
is
to
be
a
great
trouble
to
there
was
no
response
and
after
waiting
for
some
time
she
spoke
again
rather
tremulously
yet
not
timidly
father
he
rose
and
upon
his
brow
were
marked
the
blackest
lines
of
anger
she
had
ever
seen
so
that
she
leaned
back
from
him
startled
but
he
threw
down
the
open
paper
before
her
on
the
table
and
struck
it
with
his
clenched
fist
read
that
he
said
and
he
stood
over
her
while
she
read
there
were
some
grandiloquent
headlines
miss
elizabeth
carewe
an
angel
of
mercy
charming
belle
saves
the
lives
of
five
prominent
citizens
her
presence
of
mind
prevents
conflagration
from
wiping
out
the
city
it
may
be
noted
that
will
cummings
editor
and
proprietor
of
the
journal
had
written
these
tributes
as
well
as
the
whole
account
of
the
evening
transactions
and
miss
betty
loomed
as
large
in
narrative
as
in
his
good
and
lovelorn
heart
there
was
very
little
concerning
the
fire
in
the
journal
it
was
nearly
all
about
betty
that
is
one
of
the
misfortunes
which
pursue
a
lady
who
allows
an
editor
to
fall
in
love
with
her
however
there
was
a
scant
mention
of
the
arrival
of
the
volunteers
upon
the
scene
though
none
at
all
at
the
cause
of
their
delay
and
an
paragraph
was
devoted
to
their
handsome
appearance
cummings
having
been
one
of
those
who
insisted
that
the
new
uniforms
should
be
worn
soon
said
the
journal
through
the
daring
of
the
chief
of
the
department
and
the
captain
of
the
company
one
of
whom
placed
and
mounted
the
over
which
he
was
immediately
followed
by
the
other
carrying
the
hose
a
stream
was
sent
to
play
upon
the
devouring
element
a
feat
of
personally
witnessed
by
a
majority
of
our
readers
vanrevel
and
gray
were
joined
by
eugene
madrillon
tappingham
marsh
and
the
editor
of
this
paper
after
which
occurred
the
unfortunate
accident
to
the
long
ladder
leaving
the
five
named
gentlemen
in
their
terrible
predicament
face
to
face
with
death
in
its
most
awful
form
at
this
frightful
moment
and
all
the
rest
was
about
miss
carewe
as
will
himself
admitted
he
had
laid
himself
out
on
that
one
paragraph
was
composed
of
short
sentences
each
beginning
with
the
word
alone
she
entered
the
shattered
door
alone
she
set
foot
upon
the
first
flight
of
stairs
alone
she
ascended
the
second
alone
she
mounted
the
third
alone
she
lifted
her
hand
to
the
trap
alone
she
opened
it
she
was
declared
to
have
made
her
appearance
to
the
unfortunate
prisoners
on
the
roof
even
as
the
dove
to
the
despairing
noah
and
will
also
asserted
repeatedly
that
she
was
the
heroine
of
the
miss
betty
blushed
to
see
her
name
so
blazoned
forth
in
print
but
she
lacked
one
kind
of
vanity
and
failed
to
find
good
reason
for
more
than
a
somewhat
troubled
laughter
the
writer
purpose
was
so
manifestly
kind
in
spite
of
the
bizarre
result
oh
i
wish
cummings
had
she
exclaimed
it
would
have
been
better
not
to
speak
of
me
at
all
of
course
but
i
ca
see
that
there
is
anything
to
resent
it
is
so
funny
funny
carewe
repeated
the
word
in
a
cracked
falsetto
with
the
evident
intention
of
mocking
her
and
at
the
same
time
hideously
contorted
his
face
into
a
grotesque
idiocy
of
expression
pursing
his
lips
so
extremely
and
setting
his
brows
so
awry
that
his
other
features
were
cartooned
out
of
all
familiar
likeness
effecting
an
alteration
as
shocking
to
behold
in
a
man
of
his
severe
cast
of
countenance
as
was
his
falsetto
mimicry
to
hear
she
rose
in
a
kind
of
terror
perceiving
that
this
contortion
was
produced
in
burlesque
of
her
own
expression
and
as
he
pressed
nearer
her
stepped
back
overturning
her
chair
she
had
little
recollection
of
her
father
during
her
childhood
and
as
long
as
she
could
remember
no
one
had
spoken
to
her
angrily
or
even
roughly
as
she
retreated
from
him
he
leaned
forward
thrusting
the
hideous
mask
closer
to
her
white
and
face
you
ca
see
anything
to
resent
in
that
he
gibbered
it
so
funny
is
it
funny
funny
funny
i
show
you
whether
it
funny
or
not
i
show
you
his
voice
rose
almost
to
a
shriek
you
hang
around
fires
do
you
on
the
public
streets
at
night
you
a
nice
one
for
me
to
leave
in
charge
of
my
house
while
i
away
you
trollop
what
did
you
mean
by
going
up
on
that
roof
you
knew
that
damned
vanrevel
was
there
you
did
i
say
you
knew
it
she
ran
toward
the
door
with
a
frightened
cry
but
he
got
between
it
and
her
menacing
her
with
his
upraised
open
hands
shaking
them
over
her
you
a
lovely
daughter
are
you
he
shouted
hoarsely
you
knew
perfectly
well
who
was
on
that
roof
and
you
went
did
you
go
answer
me
that
if
i
had
arms
about
me
when
i
got
there
i
have
shot
that
man
dead
he
was
on
my
property
giving
orders
the
black
hound
and
when
i
ordered
him
out
he
told
me
if
i
interfered
with
his
work
before
it
was
finished
he
have
me
thrown
out
me
that
owned
the
whole
place
and
there
was
a
man
that
would
lend
me
a
pistol
better
rescue
him
from
me
you
dove
for
i
shoot
him
i
will
i
kill
that
dog
and
he
knows
it
he
can
bluster
in
a
crowd
but
he
hide
now
he
a
coward
and
he
came
home
with
me
he
brought
me
home
last
night
her
voice
rang
out
in
the
room
like
that
of
some
other
person
and
she
hardly
knew
that
it
was
herself
who
spoke
you
lie
he
screamed
and
fell
back
from
her
his
face
working
as
though
under
the
dominance
of
some
physical
disorder
the
flesh
of
it
plastic
beyond
conception
so
that
she
cried
out
and
covered
her
face
with
her
arm
you
lie
i
saw
you
at
the
hedge
with
crailey
gray
though
you
thought
i
did
what
do
you
want
to
lie
like
that
for
vanrevel
did
even
speak
to
you
i
asked
madrillon
you
lie
he
choked
upon
the
words
a
racking
cough
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
he
staggered
back
and
dropped
upon
her
overturned
chair
his
arms
beating
the
table
in
front
of
him
his
head
jerking
spasmodically
backward
and
forward
as
he
gasped
for
breath
ring
the
bell
he
panted
thickly
with
an
incoherent
gesture
nelson
knows
ring
nelson
evidently
knew
he
brought
brandy
and
water
from
the
sideboard
with
no
stinting
hand
and
within
ten
minutes
carewe
was
in
his
accustomed
seat
competent
to
finish
his
breakfast
in
solitude
however
he
sat
and
no
one
guessed
his
thoughts
for
miss
betty
had
fled
to
her
own
room
and
had
bolted
the
door
she
lay
upon
the
bed
shuddering
and
shivering
with
nausea
and
cold
though
the
day
was
warm
then
like
a
hot
pain
in
her
breast
came
a
homesickness
for
mary
and
the
of
tears
as
she
thought
of
the
quiet
convent
in
the
sunshine
over
to
the
west
the
peace
of
it
and
the
goodness
of
everybody
there
sister
cecilia
her
shoulders
shook
with
the
great
sob
that
followed
this
name
dearest
to
her
in
the
world
convulsively
whispered
to
the
dear
sister
cecilia
she
patted
the
white
pillow
with
her
hand
as
though
it
were
the
cool
cheek
against
which
she
yearned
to
lay
her
own
ah
you
would
know
you
would
know
with
the
thought
of
the
serene
face
of
the
good
sister
and
of
the
kind
arms
that
would
have
gone
round
her
in
her
trouble
her
sobbing
grew
loud
and
uncontrollable
but
she
would
not
have
her
father
hear
it
and
buried
her
face
deep
in
the
pillow
after
a
time
she
began
to
grow
quieter
turned
and
lay
with
wet
eyes
staring
unseeingly
at
the
wall
her
underlip
quivering
with
the
deep
intake
of
each
broken
sigh
oh
stars
stars
stars
she
whispered
missy
there
came
a
soft
knock
upon
the
door
and
the
clink
of
silver
upon
china
missy
what
is
it
so
quick
was
miss
betty
that
although
she
answered
almost
at
once
the
tears
were
washed
away
and
she
was
passing
a
cool
wet
towel
over
her
eyes
at
the
moment
she
spoke
jass

old
nelson
voice
was
always
low
and
gentle
with
a
quaver
and
hesitancy
in
the
utterance
now
it
was
tender
and
comforting
with
the
comprehension
of
one
in
suffering
the
extraordinary
tact
which
the
old
of
his
race
nearly
all
come
to
possess
on
piece
brown
toast
when
she
opened
the
door
he
came
in
bending
attentively
over
his
tray
and
without
a
glance
toward
his
young
mistress
made
some
show
of
fuss
and
bustle
as
he
placed
it
upon
a
table
near
the
window
and
drew
up
a
chair
for
her
so
that
she
could
sit
with
her
back
to
the
light

exclaimed

a
mighty
gay
lady
dat
big
miz
tanberry
an
ole
frien
owah
fambly
she
a
frien
er
momma
miss
betty
had
begun
by
making
a
pretence
to
eat
only
to
please
the
old
man
but
the
vain
woman
cookery
had
been
not
unduly
extolled
and
nelson
laughed
with
pleasure
to
see
the
fluffy
biscuits
and
the
chicken
wing
not
nibbled
at
but
actually
eaten
this
was
a
healthy
young
lady
he
thought
one
who
would
do
the
household
credit
and
justify
the
extravagant
pride
which
kitchen
and
stable
already
had
in
her
he
was
an
old
therefore
he
had
seen
many
young
ladies
go
through
unhappy
hours
and
he
admired
miss
betty
the
more
because
she
was
the
first
who
had
indulged
in
strong
weeping
and
did
not
snuffle
at
intervals
afterward
he
understood
perfectly
everything
that
had
passed
between
father
and
daughter
that
morning
when
her
breakfast
was
finished
she
turned
slowly
to
the
window
and
while
her
eyes
did
not
refill
a
slight
twitching
of
the
upper
lids
made
him
believe
that
she
was
going
over
the
whole
scene
again
in
her
mind
whereupon
he
began
to
move
briskly
about
the
room
with
a
busy
air
picking
up
her
napkin
dusting
a
chair
with
his
hand
exchanging
the
position
of
the
andirons
in
the
fireplace
and
apparently
discovering
that
the
of
georges
meilhac
was
out
of
line
he
set
it
awry
then
straight
again
the
while
he
hummed
an
old
spiritual
of
which
only
the
words
chain
de
lion
down
were
allowed
to
be
quite
audible
they
were
repeated
often
and
at
each
repetition
of
them
he
seemed
profoundly
though
decorously
amused
in
a
way
which
might
have
led
to
a
conjecture
that
the
refrain
bore
some
distant
reference
to
his
master
eccentricity
of
temper
at
first
be
chuckled
softly
but
at
the
final
iteration
of
chain
de
lion
down
burst
into
outright
laughter
honey
my
law
he
exclaimed
but
yo
pa
de

turned

and

himself
with
preparations
for

las
night
this
was
the
speech
he
chose
for
his
exit
but
after
closing
the
door
behind
him
he
opened
it
again
and
said
cheerfully
soon
i

colt
wid

missy
de
roads
is
mighty
good
dis
sunshiny
nelson
do
you
think
such
an
attack
as
father
had
this
morning
is
dangerous
he
had
hoped
for
another
chance
to
laugh
violently
before
he
left
her
and
this
completely
fitted
his
desire
ho
ho
he
he
shouted
no
no
no
honey
he
jass
git
so
mad
it
mek
him
sick
you
couldn
kill
dat
man
wid
a
missy
and
he
went
down
the
hail
leaving
the
reverberations
of
his
hilarity
behind
him
the
purpose
of
his
visit
had
been
effected
for
when
miss
betty
appeared
upon
the
in
her
green
habit
and
gauntlets
she
was
smiling
so
that
only
a
woman
or
a
wise
old
man
could
have
guessed
that
she
had
wept
bitterly
that
morning
she
cantered
out
to
the
flat
open
country
to
the
east
where
she
found
soft
that
were
good
for
the
bay
colt
feet
and
she
reached
a
several
miles
from
town
before
she
was
overcome
by
the
conviction
that
she
was
a
wicked
and
ungrateful
girl
she
could
not
place
the
exact
spot
of
her
guilt
but
she
knew
it
was
there
somewhere
since
she
felt
herself
a
guilty
thing
for
the
picture
which
nelson
had
drawn
rose
before
her
the
one
man
standing
alone
in
his
rage
on
the
platform
overwhelmed
by
his
calm
young
adversary
beaten
and
made
the
butt
of
laughter
for
a
thousand
her
father
had
been
in
the
wrong
in
that
quarrel
and
somehow
she
was
sure
too
he
must
have
been
wrong
in
the
personal
one
as
well
the
mysterious
difficulty
over
fanchon
gray
who
had
looked
so
ashamed
last
night
what
feud
could
they
make
over
him
of
all
people
in
the
world
he
looked
strong
enough
to
take
care
of
his
own
quarrels
even
if
he
was
so
rigorously
bound
by
fanchon
when
it
came
to
a
word
with
another
girl
but
the
conclusion
that
her
father
had
been
in
error
did
not
lessen
the
pathetic
appeal
of
the
solitary
figure
facing
the
ridicule
of
the
crowd
she
felt
that
he
always
honestly
believed
himself
in
the
right
she
knew
that
he
was
vain
that
he
had
an
almost
monstrous
conception
of
his
dignity
and
realizing
the
bitterness
of
that
public
humiliation
which
he
had
undergone
she
understood
the
wrath
the
unspeakable
pain
and
sense
of
outrage
which
must
have
possessed
him
and
now
she
was
letting
him
go
forth
upon
a
journey
his
way
beset
with
the
chances
of
illness
and
accident
whence
he
might
never
return
she
was
letting
him
go
without
seeing
him
again
letting
him
go
with
no
word
of
farewell
from
his
daughter
in
brief
she
was
a
wicked
girl
she
turned
the
colt
head
abruptly
to
the
west
and
touched
his
flanks
with
her
whip
so
it
fell
out
that
as
the
packet
foamed
its
passage
backward
from
carewe
wharf
into
the
current
the
owner
of
the
boat
standing
upon
the
hurricane
deck
heard
a
cry
from
the
shore
and
turned
to
behold
his
daughter
dash
down
to
the
very
end
of
the
wharf
on
the
colt
miss
betty
hair
was
blown
about
her
face
her
cheeks
were
rosy
her
eager
eyes
sparkling
from
more
than
the
hard
riding
papa
she
cried
i
sorry
she
leaned
forward
out
of
the
saddle
extending
her
arms
to
him
appealingly
in
a
charming
gesture
and
absolutely
ignoring
the
idlers
on
the
wharf
and
the
passengers
on
the
steamer
was
singly
intent
upon
the
tall
figure
on
the
papa
please
forgive
me
by
the
almighty
but
that
a
fine
woman
said
the
captain
of
the
boat
to
a
passenger
from
rouen
is
she
his
daughter
please
forgive
me
the
clear
voice
came
again
with
its
quaver
of
entreaty
across
the
widening
water
and
then
as
carewe
made
no
sign
by
word
or
movement
of
hearing
her
and
stood
without
the
slightest
alteration
of
his
attitude
she
cried
to
him
once
more
the
reversed
the
boat
swung
down
the
river
carewe
still
standing
immovable
on
the
while
to
the
gaze
of
those
on
the
steamer
the
figure
on
the
bay
colt
at
the
end
of
the
wharf
began
to
grow
smaller
and
smaller
she
was
waving
her
handkerchief
in
farewell
and
they
could
see
the
little
white
speck
in
the
distance
dimmer
and
dimmer
yet
fluttering
still
as
they
passed
out
of
sight
round
the
bend
nearly
of
a
mile
below
chapter
ix
the
rule
of
the
regent
betty
never
forgot
her
first
sight
of
the
old
friend
of
her
family
returning
with
a
sad
heart
she
was
walking
the
colt
slowly
through
the
when
an
extravagantly
stout
lady
in
green
muslin
illustrated
with
huge
red
flowers
came
out
upon
the
porch
and
waved
a
fat
arm
to
the
girl
the
visitor
wore
a
turban
and
a
cashmere
shawl
while
the
expanse
of
her
skirts
was
nothing
short
of
magnificent
some
seemed
to
have
been
misplaced
and
the
lady
dropped
into
it
her
outstretched
hand
terrified
betty
how
was
she
to
approach
near
enough
to
take
it
tanberry
was
about
sixty
looked
forty
and
at
first
you
might
have
guessed
she
weighed
nearly
three
hundred
but
the
lightness
of
her
smile
and
the
actual
buoyancy
which
she
somehow
imparted
to
her
whole
dominion
lessened
that
by
at
least
a
she
ballooned
out
to
the
with
a
billowy
rush
somewhere
between
bounding
and
soaring
and
miss
betty
slid
down
from
the
colt
who
shied
violently
to
find
herself
enveloped
in
spite
of
the
dome
in
a
vast
surf
of
green
and
red
muslin
my
charming
girl
exclaimed
the
lady
vehemently
in
a
voice
of
such
husky
richness
of
such
merriment
and
unction
of
delight
that
it
fell
upon
miss
betty
ear
with
more
of
the
quality
of
sheer
gayety
than
any
she
had
ever
heard
beautiful
child
what
a
beautiful
child
you
are
she
kissed
the
girl
resoundingly
on
both
cheeks
stepped
back
from
her
and
laughed
and
clapped
her
fat
hands
which
were
covered
with
flashing
rings
oh
but
you
are
a
true
blue
beauty
you
a
princess
i
am
tanberry
jane
tanberry
young
janie
tanberry
i
have
seen
you
since
you
were
a
baby
and
your
pretty
mother
was
a
girl
like
us
you
are
so
kind
to
come
said
betty
hesitatingly
i
shall
try
to
be
very
obedient
tanberry
uttered
the
word
with
a
shriek
you
be
nothing
of
the
kind
i
am
the
woman
in
the
universe
and
anyone
who
obeyed
me
would
be
embroiled
in
everlasting
trouble
every
second
in
the
day
you
find
that
i
am
the
one
that
needs
looking
after
my
charmer
she
tapped
miss
betty
cheek
with
her
jeweled
fingers
as
the
two
mounted
the
veranda
steps
it
will
be
worry
enough
for
you
to
obey
yourself
a
body
sees
that
at
the
first
blush
you
have
conscience
in
your
forehead
and
rebellion
in
your
chin
ha
ha
ha
here
tanberry
sat
upon
and
obliterated
a
large
chair
miss
carewe
taking
a
stool
at
her
knee
people
of
our
age
ought
to
be
bothered
with
obeying
there
be
time
enough
for
that
when
we
get
old
and
ca
enjoy
anything
ha
ha
tanberry
punctuated
her
observations
with
short
volleys
of
husky
laughter
so
abrupt
in
both
discharge
and
cessation
that
until
miss
betty
became
accustomed
to
the
habit
she
was
apt
to
start
slightly
at
each
salvo
i
had
a
husband
once
the
lady
resumed
but
only
once
my
friend
he
had
ideas
like
your
father
your
father
is
such
an
imbecile
and
he
thought
that
wives
sisters
daughters
and
such
like
ought
to
be
obedient
that
is
the
rest
of
the
world
was
wrong
unless
it
was
right
and
right
was
just
his
own
little
prejudices
and
emotions
dressed
up
for
a
crazy
masquerade
as
facts
poor
man
he
only
lasted
about
a
year
and
tanberry
laughed
heartily
they
been
at
me
time
and
again
to
take
she
lowered
her
voice
and
leaned
toward
betty
confidentially
not
i
i
be
willing
to
engage
myself
to
crailey
gray
though
crailey
has
got
round
to
me
yet
for
i
do
mind
just
being
engaged
my
dear
but
they
have
to
invent
something
better
than
a
man
before
i
marry
any
one
of
again
but
i
love
i
do
the
charming
billies
and
you
see
how
they
follow
me
she
patted
the
girl
shoulder
her
small
eyes
beaming
quizzically
we
have
the
gayest
house
in
rouen
ladybird
the
young
men
all
go
to
the
bareauds
but
they
come
here
now
and
we
have
the
bareauds
along
with
i
been
away
a
long
time
just
finished
unpacking
yesterday
night
when
your
father
came
in
after
the
fire
whoo
what
a
state
he
was
in
with
that
devilish
temper
of
his
did
i
snap
him
up
when
he
asked
me
to
come
and
stay
with
you
ha
ha
i
have
come
even
if
you
had
been
beautiful
but
i
was
wild
to
be
your
playmate
for
i
heard
nothing
but
betty
carewe
miss
betty
carewe
from
everybody
i
saw
since
the
minute
my
stage
came
in
you
set
all
mad
at
your
ball
and
i
knew
we
make
a
glorious
you
and
i
some
of
the
vagabonds
will
turn
up
this
very
evening
see
if
they
do
ha
ha
the
way
they
follow
me
tanberry
was
irresistible
she
filled
the
whole
place
otherwise
than
by
the
mere
material
voluminousness
of
her
bubbling
over
with
froth
of
nonsense
which
flew
through
the
house
driven
by
her
energy
like
on
a
spring
gale
and
the
day
so
discordantly
begun
for
miss
betty
grew
musical
with
her
own
laughter
answering
the
husky
staccato
of
the
vivacious
newcomer
nelson
waited
upon
them
at
table
radiant
his
smile
like
the
keyboard
of
an
ebony
piano
and
his
disappearances
into
the
kitchen
were
accomplished
by
means
of
a
surreptitious
and
followed
by
the
cachinnating
echoes
of
the
vain
mamie
reception
of
the
visitor
sallies
which
nelson
hastily
retailed
in
passing
nor
was
tanberry
prediction
allowed
to
go
unfulfilled
regarding
the
advent
of
those
persons
whom
she
had
designated
as
vagabonds
it
may
have
been
out
of
deference
to
carewe
sense
of
decorum
or
from
a
cautious
regard
of
what
he
was
liable
to
do
when
he
considered
that
sense
outraged
that
the
gallants
of
rouen
had
placed
themselves
under
the
severe
restraint
of
allowing
three
days
to
elapse
after
their
introduction
to
miss
carewe
before
they
paid
their
respects
at
the
house
but
be
that
as
it
may
the
dictator
was
now
safely
under
way
down
the
rouen
river
and
tanberry
reigned
in
his
stead
thus
at
about
eight
that
evening
the
two
ladies
sat
in
the
library
engaged
in
conversation
though
for
the
sake
of
accuracy
it
should
be
said
that
tanberry
was
engaged
in
conversation
miss
betty
in
giving
ear
when
their
attention
was
arrested
by
sounds
of
a
somewhat
musical
nature
from
the
lawn
which
sounds
were
immediately
identified
as
emanating
from
a
flute
and
violin
tanberry
bounded
across
the
room
like
a
public
building
caught
by
a
cyclone
and
dashing
at
the
candles
blow
out
blow
out
she
exclaimed
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
in
a
fluster
of
excitement
why
asked
miss
carewe
startled
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
the
candles
were
out
before
the
question
repeated
the
merry
husky
voice
in
the
darkness
my
goodness
child
precious
those
vagabonds
are
here
to
think
of
your
never
having
been
serenaded
before
she
drew
the
girl
to
the
window
and
pointed
to
a
group
of
dim
figures
near
the
iliac
bushes
the
dear
delightful
vagabonds
she
chuckled
i
knew
they
come
it
the
beautiful
tappingham
marsh
with
his
fiddle
and
young
jeff
bareaud
with
his
flute
and
madrillon
and
little
frank
chenowith
and
thin
will
cummings
to
sing
hark
to
the
rascals
it
is
perfectly
truthful
to
say
that
the
violin
and
flute
executed
the
prelude
and
then
the
trio
sounded
full
on
the
evening
air
the
more
effective
chords
obligingly
drawn
out
as
long
as
the
breath
in
the
singers
could
hold
them
in
order
to
allow
the
two
fair
auditors
complete
benefit
of
the
harmony
they
sang
the
harp
that
once
tara
halls
and
followed
it
with
long
long
that
tanberry
whispered
between
stifled
gusts
of
almost
uncontrollable
laughter
is
meant
for
just
me
tell
me
the
tales
that
to
me
were
so
dear
entreated
the
trio
i
told
plenty
gurgled
the
enlivening
widow
and
i
expect
between
us
we
can
get
up
some
now
you
are
come
my
grief
is
removed
they
sang
they
mean
your
father
is
on
his
way
to
louis
remarked
tanberry
let
me
forget
that
so
long
you
have
roved
let
me
believe
that
you
love
as
you
loved
long
long
ago
long
applaud
applaud
whispered
tanberry
encouraging
the
minstrels
by
a
hearty
clapping
of
hands
hereupon
dissension
arose
among
the
quintet
evidently
a
dispute
in
regard
to
their
next
selection
one
of
the
gentlemen
appearing
more
than
merely
to
suggest
a
solo
by
himself
while
the
others
too
frankly
expressed
adverse
opinions
upon
the
value
of
the
offering
the
argument
became
heated
and
in
spite
of
many
a
sh
and
not
so
loud
the
voice
of
the
intending
soloist
chenoweth
could
be
heard
vehemently
to
exclaim
i
will
i
learned
it
especially
for
this
occasion
i
will
sing
it
his
determination
patently
was
not
to
be
balked
without
physical
encounter
consequently
he
was
permitted
to
advance
some
paces
from
the
lilac
bushes
where
he
delivered
himself
in
an
earnest
and
plaintive
tenor
of
the
following
morbid
instructions
to
which
the
violin
played
an
obligato
in
tremulo
so
execrable
and
so
excruciatingly
discordant
that
chenoweth
subsequent
charge
that
it
was
done
with
a
deliberately
evil
intention
could
never
be
successfully
opposed
go
forget
me
why
should
sorrow
that
brow
a
shadow
fling
go
forget
me
and
brightly
smile
and
sweetly
sing
smile
tho
i
may
not
be
near
thee
smile
tho
i
may
never
see
thee
may
thy
soul
with
pleasure
shine
lasting
as
this
gloom
of
mine
miss
carewe
complied
at
once
with
the
request
while
her
companion
unable
to
stop
with
the
slight
expression
of
pleasure
demanded
by
the
songster
threw
herself
upon
a
sofa
and
gave
way
to
the
mirth
that
consumed
her
then
the
candles
were
relit
the
serenaders
invited
within
nelson
came
bearing
cake
and
wine
and
the
house
was
made
merry
presently
the
romp
virginia
bareaud
making
her
appearance
on
the
arm
of
general
trumble
tanberry
led
them
all
in
a
hearty
game
of
buff
followed
by
as
hearty
a
dancing
of
dan
tucker
after
that
a
quadrille
being
proposed
tanberry
suggested
that
jefferson
should
run
home
and
bring
fanchon
for
the
fourth
lady
however
virginia
explained
that
she
had
endeavored
to
persuade
both
her
sister
and
gray
to
accompany
the
general
and
herself
but
that
gray
had
complained
of
indisposition
having
suffered
greatly
from
headache
on
account
of
inhaling
so
much
smoke
at
the
warehouse
fire
and
of
course
fanchon
would
not
leave
him
miss
carewe
permitted
herself
the
slightest
shrug
of
the
shoulders
so
they
danced
the
quadrille
with
jefferson
at
the
piano
and
marsh
performing
in
the
character
of
a
lady
a
proceeding
most
unacceptable
to
the
general
whom
tanberry
forced
to
be
his
partner
and
thus
the
evening
passed
gayly
away
and
but
too
quickly
to
join
the
ghosts
of
all
the
other
evenings
since
time
began
and
each
of
the
little
company
had
added
a
cheerful
sprite
to
the
long
rows
of
those
varied
shades
that
the
after
years
bring
to
revisit
us
so
many
with
pathetic
reproach
so
many
bearing
a
tragic
burden
of
faces
that
we
can
not
make
even
to
weep
again
and
so
few
with
simple
merriment
and
lightheartedness
tappingham
marsh
spoke
the
truth
indeed
when
he
exclaimed
in
parting
o
rare
tanberry
but
the
house
had
not
done
with
serenades
that
night
the
guests
had
long
since
departed
the
windows
were
still
and
dark
under
the
wan
old
moon
which
had
risen
lamely
looking
unfamiliar
and
not
half
itself
the
air
bore
an
odor
of
lateness
and
nothing
moved
when
a
delicate
harmony
stole
out
of
the
shadows
beyond
the
misty
garden
low
but
resonant
chords
sounded
on
the
heavier
strings
of
a
guitar
while
above
them
upon
the
lighter
wires
rippled
a
slender
tinkling
melody
that
wooed
the
slumberer
to
a
delicious
as
dreamily
as
tenderly
as
the
croon
of
rain
on
the
roof
soothes
a
child
to
sleep
under
the
artist
cunning
touch
the
instrument
was
both
the
accompaniment
and
the
song
and
miss
betty
at
first
taking
the
music
to
be
a
wandering
thread
in
the
fabric
of
her
own
bright
dreams
drifted
gradually
to
consciousness
to
find
herself
smiling
her
eyes
opened
wide
but
half
closed
again
with
the
ineffable
sweetness
of
the
sound
then
a
voice
was
heard
eerily
low
yet
gallant
and
clear
a
vibrant
baritone
singing
to
the
guitar
my
lady
hair
that
dark
delight
is
both
as
fair
and
dusk
as
night
i
know
some
lovelorn
hearts
that
beat
in
time
to
moonbeam
twinklings
fleet
that
dance
and
glance
like
jewels
there
emblazoning
the
raven
hair
ah
raven
hair
so
dark
and
bright
what
loves
lie
there
enmeshed
i
know
some
sighing
lads
that
say
their
hearts
were
snared
and
torn
away
and
now
as
pearls
one
fate
they
share
entangled
in
the
raven
hair
ah
raven
hair
from
such
a
plight
could
you
not
spare
one
acolyte
i
know
a
broken
heart
that
went
to
serve
you
but
as
ornament
alas
a
ruby
now
you
wear
ensanguining
the
raven
hair
the
song
had
grown
fainter
and
fainter
the
singer
moving
away
as
he
sang
and
the
last
lines
were
almost
inaudible
in
the
distance
the
guitar
could
be
heard
for
a
moment
or
two
more
then
silence
came
again
it
was
broken
by
a
rustling
in
the
room
next
to
miss
betty
and
tanberry
called
softly
through
the
open
door
princess
are
you
awake
did
you
hear
that
serenade
after
a
pause
the
answer
came
hesitatingly
in
a
small
faltering
voice
yes
if
it
was
one
i
thought
perhaps
he
was
only
singing
as
he
passed
along
the
aha
ejaculated
tanberry
abruptly
as
though
she
had
made
an
unexpected
discovery
you
knew
better
and
this
was
a
serenade
that
you
did
not
laugh
at
beautiful
i
would
let
it
go
any
farther
even
while
your
father
is
gone
something
might
occur
that
would
bring
him
home
without
warning
such
things
have
happened
tom
vanrevel
ought
to
be
kept
far
away
from
this
oh
it
was
not
he
returned
miss
betty
quickly
it
was
gray
did
you
my
dear
interrupted
the
other
crailey
gray
specialty
is
talking
most
of
the
vagabonds
can
sing
and
play
a
bit
and
so
can
crailey
particularly
when
he
had
a
few
bowls
of
punch
but
when
tom
vanrevel
touches
the
guitar
and
lifts
up
his
voice
to
sing
there
is
an
angel
in
heaven
that
would
quit
the
place
and
come
to
hear
him
crailey
wrote
those
words
to
virginia
bareaud
her
hair
is
even
darker
than
yours
you
know
that
was
when
he
was
being
engaged
to
her
and
tom
must
have
set
the
music
to
lately
and
now
comes
here
to
sing
to
you
and
well
enough
they
fit
you
but
you
must
keep
him
away
nevertheless
betty
knew
the
voice
was
not
that
which
had
bid
her
look
to
the
stars
and
she
remained
convinced
that
it
belonged
to
crailey
gray
who
had
been
too
ill
a
few
hours
earlier
to
leave
the
bareaud
house
and
now
with
fanchon
kisses
on
his
lips
came
stealing
into
her
garden
and
sang
to
her
a
song
he
had
made
for
another
girl
and
the
angels
would
leave
heaven
to
listen
when
he
sang
would
they
poor
fanchon
no
wonder
she
held
him
so
tightly
in
leading
strings
he
might
risk
his
life
all
he
wished
at
the
end
of
a
dangling
in
a
fiery
cloud
above
nothing
but
when
it
came
to
ah
well
poor
fanchon
did
she
invent
the
headaches
for
him
or
did
she
make
him
invent
them
for
himself
if
there
was
one
person
in
the
world
whom
miss
betty
held
in
bitter
contempt
and
scorn
it
was
the
owner
of
that
voice
and
that
guitar
chapter
x
echoes
of
a
serenade
more
than
three
gentlemen
of
rouen
wore
their
hearts
in
their
eyes
for
any
fool
to
gaze
upon
but
three
was
the
number
of
those
who
told
their
love
before
the
end
of
the
first
week
of
carewe
absence
and
told
it
in
spite
of
tanberry
utmost
effort
to
preserve
at
all
times
a
conjunction
between
herself
and
miss
betty
for
the
good
lady
foreseeing
these
declarations
much
more
surely
than
did
the
subject
of
them
wished
to
spare
her
lovely
charge
the
pain
of
listening
to
them
miss
carewe
honored
each
of
the
lorn
three
with
few
minutes
of
gravity
but
the
gentle
refusal
prevented
never
a
swain
from
being
as
truly
her
follower
as
before
not
that
she
resorted
to
the
poor
device
of
the
method
of
the
flirt
who
thus
keeps
the
lads
in
dalliance
but
because
even
for
the
rejected
it
was
a
delight
to
be
near
her
for
that
matter
it
is
said
that
no
one
ever
had
enough
of
the
mere
looking
at
her
also
her
talk
was
enlivening
even
to
the
lively
being
spiced
with
surprising
turns
and
amiably
seasoned
with
the
art
of
badinage
to
use
the
phrase
of
the
time
she
possessed
the
accomplishments
an
antiquated
charm
now
on
the
point
of
disappearing
so
carefully
has
it
been
snubbed
under
whenever
exhibited
the
pursuing
wraith
of
the
young
it
comes
to
sit
a
ghost
at
every
banquet
driving
the
flower
of
our
youth
to
exertions
in
search
of
escape
to
dubious
diplomacy
to
dismal
inaction
or
to
wine
yet
time
was
when
they
set
their
hearts
on
the
miss
betty
carewe
at
her
harp
ah
it
was
a
dainty
picture
the
clear
profile
with
the
dark
hair
low
across
the
temple
silhouetted
duskily
in
the
cool
shadowy
room
against
the
open
window
the
slender
figure
one
arm
curving
between
you
and
the
strings
the
other
gleaming
behind
them
the
delicate
little
sandal
stealing
from
the
white
froth
of
silk
and
lace
to
caress
the
pedal
the
nimble
hands
fluttering
across
the
long
strands
like
white
blossoms
borne
on
slanting
lines
of
rain
and
the
great
gold
harp
rising
to
catch
a
javelin
of
sunshine
that
pierced
the
vines
at
the
window
where
the
honeysuckles
swung
their
skirts
to
the
refrain
it
was
a
picture
to
return
many
a
long
year
afterward
and
thrill
the
reveries
of
old
men
who
were
then
young
and
following
the
light
cascading
ripples
of
the
harp
when
her
low
contralto
lifted
in
one
of
the
old
songs
she
often
turned
inquiringly
to
see
if
the
listener
liked
the
music
and
her
brilliant
dark
eyes
would
rest
on
his
with
an
appeal
that
blinded
his
entranced
soul
she
meant
it
for
the
mere
indication
of
a
friendly
wish
to
suit
his
tastes
but
it
looked
like
the
divine
humility
of
love
nobody
wondered
that
general
trumble
should
fall
to
in
his
old
age
she
sketched
magnificently
this
is
the
very
strongest
support
for
the
assertion
frank
chenoweth
and
tappingham
marsh
agreed
with
tears
of
enthusiasm
that
magnificently
was
the
only
word
they
came
to
this
conclusion
as
they
sat
together
at
the
end
of
a
long
dinner
at
which
very
little
had
been
eaten
after
a
day
picnic
by
the
river
miss
carewe
had
been
of
their
company
and
tappingham
and
chenoweth
found
each
his
opportunity
in
the
afternoon
the
party
was
small
and
no
one
had
been
able
to
effect
a
total
unconsciousness
of
the
maneuvers
of
the
two
even
fanchon
bareaud
comprehended
languidly
though
she
was
more
blurred
than
ever
and
her
eyes
belied
the
mechanical
vivacity
of
her
manner
for
crailey
was
thirty
miles
down
the
river
with
a
neatly
packed
in
a
leather
case
vanrevel
of
course
was
not
invited
no
one
would
have
thought
of
asking
him
to
join
a
small
party
of
which
robert
carewe
daughter
was
to
be
a
member
but
it
was
happiness
enough
for
tom
that
night
to
lie
hidden
in
the
shrubbery
looking
up
at
the
stars
between
the
leaves
while
he
listened
to
her
harp
and
borne
through
the
open
window
on
enchanted
airs
the
voice
of
elizabeth
carewe
singing
robin
it
was
now
that
the
town
indulged
its
liveliest
spirit
never
an
evening
lacked
its
junketing
while
the
happy
folk
of
rouen
set
the
early
summer
to
music
serenade
dance
and
song
for
them
the
young
and
old
making
gay
together
it
was
all
laughter
either
in
sunshine
or
by
candlelight
undisturbed
by
the
far
thunder
below
the
southern
horizon
where
zachary
taylor
had
pitched
his
tent
upon
the
rio
grande
one
fair
evening
soon
after
that
excursion
which
had
proved
fatal
to
the
hopes
of
the
handsome
tappingham
and
of
the
youthful
chenoweth
it
was
the
privilege
of
thomas
vanrevel
to
assist
miss
carewe
and
her
chaperon
from
their
carriage
as
they
drove
up
to
a
dance
at
the
bareauds
this
good
fortune
fell
only
to
great
deserving
for
he
had
spent
an
hour
lurking
outside
the
house
in
the
hope
of
performing
such
offices
for
them
heaven
was
in
his
soul
and
the
breath
departed
out
of
his
body
when
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
miss
betty
little
glove
was
placed
in
his
hand
and
her
white
slipper
shimmered
out
from
the
lilac
flounces
of
her
dress
to
fall
like
a
benediction
he
thought
on
each
of
the
it
was
the
age
of
garlands
they
wreathed
the
muses
the
seasons
and
their
speech
so
the
women
wore
wreaths
in
their
hair
and
miss
betty
that
night
was
of
marguerites
read
your
fortune
in
them
all
whispered
tom
heart
and
of
whomsoever
you
wish
to
learn
every
petal
will
say
loves
you
none
declare
he
loves
you
not
she
bowed
slightly
but
did
not
speak
to
him
which
was
perhaps
a
better
reception
than
that
accorded
the
young
man
by
her
companion
oh
you
is
it
was
tanberry
courteous
observation
as
she
canted
the
vehicle
in
her
descent
she
looked
sharply
at
miss
betty
and
even
the
small
glow
of
the
showed
that
the
girl
cheeks
had
flushed
very
red
vanrevel
on
the
contrary
was
pale
they
stood
for
a
moment
in
awkward
silence
while
from
the
lighted
house
where
the
flying
figures
circled
came
the
waltz
i
dreamt
that
i
in
tom
own
dreams
were
much
wilder
than
the
gypsy
girl
he
knew
that
yet
he
spoke
out
bravely
will
you
dance
the
two
first
with
me
miss
betty
bit
her
lip
frowned
turned
away
and
vouchsafing
no
reply
walked
toward
the
house
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
but
just
as
they
reached
the
door
she
flashed
over
him
a
look
that
scorched
him
from
head
to
foot
and
sent
his
spirits
down
through
the
soles
of
his
boots
to
excavate
a
grotto
in
the
depths
of
the
earth
so
charged
it
was
with
wrathful
pity
and
contempt
yes
she
said
abruptly
and
followed
tanberry
to
the
the
elder
lady
shook
her
head
solemnly
as
she
emerged
from
the
enormous
folds
of
a
yellow
silk
cloak
ah
princess
she
said
touching
the
girl
shoulder
with
her
jeweled
hand
i
told
you
i
was
a
very
foolish
woman
and
i
am
but
not
so
foolish
as
to
offer
advice
often
yet
believe
me
it
wo
do
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
greatest
young
men
i
ever
knew
and
it
a
pity
but
it
wo
miss
betty
kept
her
face
away
from
her
guardian
for
a
moment
no
inconsiderable
amount
of
information
had
drifted
to
her
from
here
and
there
regarding
the
career
of
crailey
gray
and
she
thought
how
intensely
she
would
have
hated
any
person
in
the
world
except
tanberry
for
presuming
to
think
she
needed
to
be
warned
against
the
charms
of
this
serenading
who
was
the
property
of
another
girl
you
must
keep
him
away
i
think
ventured
tanberry
gently
at
that
betty
turned
to
her
and
said
sharply
i
will
after
this
please
let
us
never
speak
of
him
a
slow
nod
of
the
other
turbaned
head
indicated
the
gravest
acquiescence
she
saw
that
her
companion
cheeks
were
still
crimson
i
understand
said
she
a
buzz
of
whispering
like
a
july
beetle
followed
miss
carewe
and
her
partner
about
the
room
during
the
next
dance
how
had
tom
managed
it
had
her
father
never
told
her
who
had
dared
to
introduce
them
fanchon
was
the
only
one
who
knew
and
as
she
whirled
by
with
will
cummings
she
raised
her
absent
glance
long
enough
to
give
tom
an
affectionate
and
warning
shake
of
the
head
tom
did
not
see
this
miss
carewe
did
alas
she
smiled
upon
him
instantly
and
looked
deep
into
his
eyes
it
was
the
third
time
she
was
not
afraid
of
this
he
was
to
be
settled
with
once
and
forever
she
intended
to
avenge
both
fanchon
and
herself
yet
it
is
a
hazardous
game
this
piercing
of
eye
with
eye
because
the
point
which
seeks
to
penetrate
may
soften
and
melt
leaving
one
defenseless
for
perhaps
ten
seconds
that
straight
look
lasted
while
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
read
clear
into
the
soul
of
him
and
to
behold
it
through
some
befooling
magic
as
strong
tender
wise
and
true
as
his
outward
appearance
would
have
made
an
innocent
stranger
believe
him
for
he
looked
all
these
things
she
admitted
that
much
and
he
had
an
air
of
distinction
and
resource
beyond
any
she
had
ever
known
even
in
the
wild
scramble
for
her
kitten
he
had
not
lost
it
so
for
ten
seconds
which
may
be
a
long
time
she
saw
a
man
such
as
she
had
dreamed
and
she
did
not
believe
her
sight
because
she
had
no
desire
to
be
as
credulous
as
the
others
to
be
as
easily
cheated
as
that
poor
fanchon
the
luckless
tom
found
his
own
feet
beautiful
on
the
mountains
and
treading
the
heights
with
airy
steps
appeared
to
himself
wonderful
and
glorified
he
was
waltzing
with
miss
betty
he
breathed
the
entrancing
words
to
himself
over
and
over
it
was
true
he
was
waltzing
with
miss
betty
carewe
her
glove
lay
warm
and
light
within
his
own
his
fingers
clasped
that
ineffable
lilac
and
white
brocade
waist
sometimes
her
hair
came
within
an
inch
of
his
cheek
and
then
he
rose
outright
from
the
hilltops
and
floated
in
a
golden
mist
the
glamour
of
which
the
incroyable
had
planned
to
tell
her
some
day
surrounded
tom
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
whole
world
was
covered
with
a
beautiful
light
like
a
carpet
which
was
but
the
radiance
of
this
adorable
girl
whom
his
gloves
and
were
permitted
to
touch
when
the
music
stopped
they
followed
in
the
train
of
other
couples
seeking
the
coolness
of
for
the
interval
and
tom
in
his
soul
laughed
at
all
other
men
with
illimitable
condescension
stop
here
she
said
as
they
reached
the
open
gate
he
was
walking
out
of
it
his
head
in
the
air
and
miss
betty
on
his
arm
apparently
he
would
have
walked
straight
across
the
state
it
was
the
happiest
moment
he
had
ever
known
he
wanted
to
say
something
wonderful
to
her
his
speech
should
be
like
the
music
and
glory
and
lire
that
was
in
him
therefore
he
was
shocked
to
hear
himself
remarking
with
an
inanity
of
utterance
that
sickened
him
oh
here
the
gate
is
it
her
answer
was
a
short
laugh
you
mean
you
wish
to
persuade
me
that
you
had
forgotten
it
was
there
i
did
not
see
it
he
protested
lamentably
no
i
was
thinking
of
indeed
you
were
in
thoughts
of
of
you
he
said
before
he
could
check
himself
yes
her
tone
was
as
quietly
contemptuous
as
she
could
make
it
how
very
frank
of
you
may
i
ask
are
you
convinced
that
speeches
of
that
sort
are
always
to
a
lady
liking
no
he
answered
humbly
and
hung
his
head
then
she
threw
the
question
at
him
abruptly
was
it
you
who
came
to
sing
in
our
garden
there
was
a
long
pause
before
a
profound
sigh
came
tremulously
from
the
darkness
like
a
sad
and
tender
confession
i
thought
so
she
exclaimed
mrs
tanberry
thought
it
was
someone
else
but
i
knew
that
it
was
yes
you
are
right
he
said
quietly
it
was
i
it
was
my
only
way
to
tell
you
what
you
know
of
course
she
set
it
all
aside
with
those
two
words
and
the
slightest
gesture
of
her
hand
it
was
a
song
made
for
another
girl
i
believe
she
asked
lightly
and
with
an
icy
smile
inquired
farther
for
the
one
the
one
before
the
last
i
understand
he
lifted
his
head
surprised
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
the
music
was
made
for
you
but
then
i
think
all
music
was
made
for
leave
the
music
out
of
it
if
you
please
she
said
impatiently
your
talents
make
you
modest
no
doubt
you
consider
it
unmaidenly
in
me
to
have
referred
to
the
serenade
before
you
spoke
of
it
but
i
am
not
one
to
cast
down
my
eyes
and
let
it
pass
no
nor
one
too
sweet
to
face
the
truth
either
she
cried
with
sudden
passion
to
sing
that
song
in
the
way
you
did
meant
oh
you
thought
i
would
flirt
with
you
what
right
had
you
to
come
with
such
a
song
to
me
tom
intended
only
to
disclaim
the
presumption
so
far
from
his
thoughts
that
his
song
had
moved
her
for
he
could
see
that
her
attack
was
prompted
by
her
inexplicable
impression
that
he
had
assumed
the
attitude
of
a
conqueror
but
his
explanation
began
unfortunately
forgive
me
i
think
you
have
completely
misunderstood
you
thought
it
meant
something
i
did
not
intend
at
all
and
what
she
said
and
her
eyes
blazed
for
now
she
beheld
him
as
the
arrant
sneak
of
the
world
he
the
with
his
hypocritical
air
of
strength
and
melancholy
sweetness
the
leader
of
drunken
revels
and
by
reputation
the
town
lothario
and
under
promise
of
marriage
to
fanchon
bareaud
had
tried
to
make
love
to
another
girl
and
now
his
cowardice
in
trying
to
disclaim
what
he
had
done
lent
him
the
insolence
to
say
to
this
other
my
child
you
are
betrayed
by
your
youth
and
conceit
you
exaggerate
my
meaning
i
had
no
intention
to
distinguish
you
by
coquetting
with
you
this
was
her
interpretation
of
him
and
her
indignation
was
not
lessened
by
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
he
who
had
been
through
so
many
scenes
with
women
secretly
found
her
simplicity
diverting
miss
betty
had
a
little
of
her
father
in
her
while
it
was
part
of
her
youth
too
that
of
all
things
she
could
least
endure
the
shadow
of
a
smile
at
her
own
expense
oh
oh
she
cried
her
voice
shaking
with
anger
i
suppose
your
bad
heart
is
with
your
laughter
at
she
turned
from
him
swiftly
and
left
him
almost
running
she
entered
the
house
and
hurried
to
a
seat
by
tanberry
nestling
to
her
like
a
young
sapling
on
a
hillside
instantaneously
several
gentlemen
who
had
hastily
acquitted
themselves
of
various
obligations
in
order
to
seek
her
sprang
forward
with
eager
greetings
so
that
when
the
stricken
tom
dazed
and
confounded
by
his
evil
luck
followed
her
at
about
five
paces
he
found
himself
confronted
by
an
impenetrable
abbatis
formed
by
the
spiked
tails
of
the
coats
of
general
trumble
madrillon
tappingham
marsh
cummings
and
jefferson
bareaud
within
this
fortification
rang
out
laughter
and
sally
from
miss
carewe
her
color
was
high
and
her
eyes
sparkled
never
more
brightly
flourish
and
alarums
sounded
for
a
quadrille
each
of
the
firmly
elbowing
his
neighbor
begged
the
dance
of
miss
betty
but
tom
was
himself
again
and
laid
a
long
strong
hand
on
madrillon
shoulder
pressed
him
gently
aside
and
said
forgive
me
miss
carewe
has
honored
me
by
the
promise
of
this
he
bowed
offering
his
arm
and
none
of
them
was
too
vain
to
envy
that
bow
and
gesture
for
a
moment
he
remained
waiting
miss
carewe
rose
slowly
and
directly
facing
him
said
in
composed
and
even
voice
you
force
me
to
beg
you
never
to
address
me
she
placed
her
hand
on
the
general
arm
turning
her
back
squarely
upon
tom
in
addition
to
those
who
heard
many
persons
in
that
part
of
the
room
saw
the
affront
and
paused
in
arrested
attitudes
others
observing
these
turned
inquiringly
so
that
sudden
silence
fell
broken
only
by
the
voice
of
miss
betty
as
she
moved
away
talking
cheerily
to
the
general
tom
was
left
standing
alone
in
the
broken
semicircle
all
the
eyes
swept
from
her
to
him
and
back
then
everyone
began
to
talk
hastily
about
nothing
the
young
man
humiliation
was
public
he
went
to
the
door
under
cover
of
the
movement
of
the
various
couples
to
find
places
in
the
quadrille
yet
every
sidelong
glance
in
the
room
still
rested
upon
him
and
he
knew
it
he
remained
in
the
ball
alone
through
that
dance
and
at
its
conclusion
walked
slowly
through
the
rooms
speaking
to
people
here
and
there
as
though
nothing
had
happened
but
when
the
music
sounded
again
he
went
to
the
found
his
hat
and
cloak
and
left
the
house
for
a
while
he
stood
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
watching
the
lighted
windows
and
twice
he
caught
sight
of
the
lilac
and
white
brocade
the
dark
hair
and
the
wreath
of
marguerites
then
with
a
hot
pain
in
his
breast
and
the
step
of
a
grenadier
he
marched
down
the
street
in
the
carriage
tanberry
took
betty
hand
in
hers
i
do
as
you
wish
child
she
said
and
never
speak
to
you
of
him
again
as
long
as
i
live
except
this
once
i
think
it
was
best
for
his
own
sake
as
well
as
yours
but
he
needed
a
lesson
interrupted
miss
betty
wearily
she
had
danced
long
and
hard
and
she
was
very
tired
tanberry
staccato
laugh
came
out
irrepressibly
all
the
vagabonds
do
princess
she
cried
and
i
think
they
are
getting
no
no
i
do
mean
we
turned
their
heads
my
dear
between
us
you
and
i
and
have
to
turn
again
or
they
break
their
necks
looking
over
their
shoulders
at
us
the
owls
she
pressed
the
girl
hand
affectionately
but
you
let
me
say
something
just
once
and
forgive
me
because
the
same
foolish
age
you
know
it
only
this
the
next
young
man
you
suppress
take
him
off
in
a
corner
lead
him
away
from
the
crowd
where
he
wo
have
to
stand
and
let
them
look
at
him
afterward
that
all
my
dear
and
you
must
i
not
sorry
said
miss
betty
hotly
i
not
sorry
no
no
said
tanberry
soothingly
it
was
better
this
time
to
do
just
what
you
did
i
have
done
it
myself
to
make
quite
sure
he
would
keep
away
because
i
like
i
not
sorry
said
miss
betty
again
i
not
sorry
she
repeated
and
reiterated
to
herself
after
tanberry
had
gone
to
bed
she
had
sunk
into
a
chair
in
the
library
with
a
book
and
i
not
sorry
she
whispered
as
the
open
unread
page
blurred
before
her
i
not
sorry
he
had
needed
his
lesson
but
she
had
to
bear
the
recollection
of
how
white
his
face
went
when
he
received
it
her
affront
had
put
about
him
a
strange
loneliness
the
one
figure
with
the
stilled
crowd
staring
it
had
made
a
picture
from
which
her
mind
eye
had
been
unable
to
escape
danced
she
never
so
hard
and
late
unconsciously
robert
carewe
daughter
had
avenged
the
other
figure
which
had
stood
in
lonely
humiliation
before
the
staring
eyes
i
not
sorry
ah
did
they
think
it
was
in
her
to
hurt
any
living
thing
in
the
world
the
book
dropped
from
her
lap
and
she
bowed
her
head
upon
her
hands
i
not
sorry
and
tears
upon
the
small
lace
gauntlets
she
saw
them
and
with
an
incoherent
exclamation
half
half
impatient
ran
out
to
the
stars
above
her
garden
she
was
there
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
and
just
before
she
returned
to
the
house
she
did
a
singular
thing
standing
where
all
was
clear
to
the
sky
where
she
had
stood
after
her
talk
with
the
incroyable
when
he
had
bid
her
look
to
the
stars
she
raised
her
arms
to
them
again
her
face
pale
with
a
great
tenderness
uplifted
you
you
you
she
whispered
i
love
you
and
yet
it
was
to
nothing
definite
to
no
man
nor
outline
of
a
man
to
no
phantom
nor
that
she
spoke
neither
to
him
she
had
affronted
nor
to
him
who
had
bidden
her
look
to
the
stars
nor
was
it
to
the
stars
themselves
she
returned
slowly
and
thoughtfully
to
the
house
wondering
what
she
had
meant
chapter
xi
a
voice
in
a
garden
crailey
came
home
the
next
day
with
a
new
poem
but
no
fish
he
lounged
up
the
stairs
late
in
the
afternoon
humming
cheerfully
to
himself
and
dropping
his
rod
in
a
corner
of
tom
office
laid
the
poem
on
the
desk
before
his
partner
produced
a
large
flask
opened
it
stretched
himself
comfortably
upon
a
capacious
sofa
drank
a
deep
draught
chuckled
softly
and
requested
vanrevel
to
set
the
rhymes
to
music
immediately
try
it
on
your
instrument
he
said
it
a
simple
verse
about
nothing
but
stars
and
you
can
work
it
out
in
twenty
minutes
with
the
it
is
broken
said
tom
not
looking
up
from
his
work
broken
when
last
who
broke
it
it
fell
from
the
table
in
my
how
easily
mended
is
it
i
think
i
shall
not
play
it
soon
crailey
swung
his
long
legs
off
the
sofa
and
abruptly
sat
upright
what
this
he
asked
gravely
tom
pushed
his
papers
away
from
him
rose
and
went
to
the
dusty
window
that
looked
to
the
west
where
at
the
end
of
the
long
street
the
sun
was
setting
behind
the
ruin
of
charred
timbers
on
the
bank
of
the
shining
river
it
seems
that
i
played
once
too
often
he
said
crailey
was
thoroughly
astonished
he
took
a
long
affectionate
pull
at
the
flask
and
offered
it
to
his
partner
no
said
tom
turning
to
him
with
a
troubled
face
and
if
i
were
you
i
would
either
these
fishing
trips
of
yours
fishing
crailey
laughed
trips
of
a
poetaster
it
then
i
write
best
and
write
i
will
there
a
poem
and
a
damned
good
one
too
old
preacher
in
every
gill
of
whiskey
and
i
the
lad
that
can
extract
it
lord
what
better
than
to
be
out
in
the
open
all
by
yourself
in
the
woods
or
on
the
river
think
of
the
long
nights
alone
with
the
glory
of
heaven
and
a
good
demijohn
why
a
man
thoughts
are
like
actors
performing
in
the
air
and
all
the
crowding
stars
for
audience
you
know
in
your
soul
you
rather
have
me
out
there
going
it
all
by
myself
than
raising
thunder
over
town
and
you
know
too
it
does
tell
on
me
it
does
show
you
could
guess
to
save
your
life
how
much
i
had
now
could
you
yes
returned
the
other
i
well
well
said
crailey
we
were
talking
of
he
set
down
the
flask
went
to
his
friend
and
dropped
a
hand
lightly
on
his
shoulder
what
made
you
break
the
guitar
tell
what
makes
you
think
i
broke
it
asked
his
partner
sharply
tell
me
why
you
did
it
said
crailey
and
tom
pacing
the
room
told
him
while
crailey
stood
in
silence
looking
him
eagerly
in
the
eye
whenever
tom
turned
his
way
the
listener
interrupted
seldom
once
it
was
to
exclaim
but
you
have
said
why
you
broke
the
guitar
thine
eye
offend
thee
pluck
it
out
i
ought
to
have
cut
off
the
hands
that
played
to
and
cut
your
throat
for
singing
to
her
she
was
right
the
other
answered
striding
up
and
down
the
room
right
a
thousand
times
in
everything
she
did
that
i
should
even
her
was
an
unspeakable
insolence
i
had
forgotten
and
so
possibly
had
she
but
i
had
not
even
been
properly
introduced
to
no
you
had
that
true
observed
crailey
reflectively
you
do
seem
to
have
much
to
reproach
her
with
reproach
her
cried
the
other
that
i
should
dream
she
would
speak
to
me
or
have
anything
to
do
with
me
was
to
cast
a
doubt
upon
her
loyalty
as
a
daughter
she
was
right
i
say
and
she
did
the
only
thing
she
could
do
rebuked
me
before
them
all
no
one
ever
merited
what
he
got
more
roundly
than
i
deserved
that
who
was
i
in
her
eyes
that
i
should
besiege
her
with
my
importunities
who
but
her
father
worst
enemy
deep
anxiety
knitted
crailey
brow
i
understood
she
knew
of
the
quarrel
he
said
thoughtfully
i
saw
that
the
other
evening
when
i
helped
her
out
of
the
crowd
she
spoke
of
it
on
the
way
home
i
remember
but
how
did
she
know
that
you
were
vanrevel
no
one
in
town
would
be
apt
to
mention
you
to
no
but
she
did
know
you
yes
returned
gray
slowly
so
it
seems
probably
her
father
told
her
to
avoid
you
and
described
you
so
that
she
recognized
you
as
the
man
who
caught
the
he
paused
picked
up
the
flask
and
again
applied
himself
to
its
contents
his
eyes
peering
over
the
vessel
at
tom
who
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
office
after
a
time
crailey
fumbling
in
his
coat
found
a
long
cheroot
and
as
he
lit
it
inquired
casually
do
you
remember
if
she
addressed
you
by
name
i
think
not
tom
answered
halting
what
does
it
matter
crailey
drew
a
deep
breath
it
does
he
returned
she
knew
me
well
enough
said
tom
sadly
as
he
resumed
his
yes
repeated
crailey
deliberately
so
it
seems
so
it
seems
he
blew
a
long
stream
of
smoke
out
into
the
air
before
him
and
softly
again
so
it
seems
so
it
silence
fell
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
tom
footsteps
until
presently
some
one
informally
shouted
his
name
from
the
street
below
it
was
only
will
cummings
passing
the
time
of
day
but
when
tom
turned
from
the
window
after
answering
him
crailey
his
poem
and
his
flask
were
gone
that
evening
vanrevel
sat
in
the
dusty
office
driving
himself
to
his
work
with
a
sharp
goad
for
there
was
a
face
that
came
between
him
and
all
else
in
the
world
and
a
voice
that
sounded
always
in
his
ears
but
the
work
was
done
before
he
rose
from
his
chair
though
he
showed
a
haggard
visage
as
he
bent
above
his
candles
to
blow
them
out
it
was
eleven
crailey
had
not
come
back
and
tom
knew
that
his
friend
would
not
return
for
many
hours
and
so
having
no
mind
to
read
and
no
belief
that
he
could
if
he
tried
he
went
out
to
walk
the
streets
he
went
down
to
the
river
first
and
stood
for
a
little
while
gazing
at
the
ruins
of
the
two
warehouses
and
that
was
like
a
man
with
a
headache
beating
his
skull
against
a
wall
as
he
stood
on
the
blackened
wharf
he
saw
how
the
charred
beams
rose
above
him
against
the
sky
like
a
gallows
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
nothing
could
have
been
a
better
symbol
for
here
he
had
hanged
his
reproach
her
he
who
had
so
displayed
his
imbecility
before
her
had
he
been
her
father
best
friend
he
should
have
had
too
great
a
sense
of
shame
to
dare
to
speak
to
her
after
that
night
when
her
quiet
intelligence
had
exhibited
him
to
himself
and
to
all
the
world
as
nought
else
than
a
fool
and
a
noisy
one
at
that
suddenly
a
shudder
convulsed
him
he
struck
his
open
palm
across
his
forehead
and
spoke
aloud
while
from
horizon
to
horizon
the
night
air
grew
thick
with
the
whispered
laughter
of
observing
hobgoblins
and
even
if
there
had
been
no
stairway
we
could
have
slid
down
the
he
retraced
his
steps
a
tall
gray
figure
moving
slowly
through
the
blue
darkness
and
his
lips
formed
the
shadow
of
a
smile
when
he
found
that
he
had
unconsciously
turned
into
carewe
street
presently
he
came
to
a
gap
in
a
hedge
through
which
he
had
sometimes
stolen
to
hear
the
sound
of
a
harp
and
a
girl
voice
singing
but
he
did
not
enter
there
tonight
though
he
paused
a
moment
his
head
bowed
on
his
breast
there
came
a
sound
of
voices
they
seemed
to
be
moving
toward
the
hedge
toward
the
gap
where
he
stood
one
a
man
eager
quick
but
very
musical
the
other
a
girl
a
rich
and
clear
contralto
that
passed
into
tom
soul
like
a
psalm
of
rejoicing
and
like
a
scimitar
of
flame
he
shivered
and
moved
away
quickly
but
not
before
the
man
voice
somewhat
louder
for
the
moment
came
distinctly
from
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
after
all
said
the
voice
with
a
ripple
of
laughter
after
all
were
you
a
little
hard
on
that
poor
gray
tom
did
not
understand
but
he
knew
the
voice
it
was
that
of
crailey
gray
he
heard
the
same
voice
again
that
night
and
again
stood
unseen
long
after
midnight
he
was
still
tramping
the
streets
on
his
lonely
rounds
when
he
chanced
to
pass
the
rouen
house
which
hostelry
bore
to
the
uninitiated
eye
the
appearance
of
having
closed
its
doors
upon
all
hospitalities
for
the
night
in
strict
compliance
with
the
law
of
the
city
fathers
yet
a
slender
wand
of
bright
light
might
be
discovered
underneath
the
street
door
of
the
from
within
the
merry
retreat
issued
an
uproar
of
shouting
raucous
laughter
and
the
pounding
of
glasses
on
tables
heralding
all
too
plainly
the
hypocrisy
of
the
landlord
and
possibly
that
of
the
city
fathers
also
tom
knew
what
company
was
gathered
there
gamblers
truckmen
drunken
farmers
men
from
the
river
steamers
making
riot
while
their
boats
lay
at
the
wharf
with
a
motley
gathering
of
of
the
and
tippling
clerks
from
the
main
street
stores
there
came
loud
cries
for
a
song
and
in
answer
the
voice
of
crailey
rose
over
the
general
din
somewhat
hoarse
and
never
so
musical
when
he
sang
as
when
he
spoke
yet
so
touching
in
its
dramatic
tenderness
that
soon
the
noise
fell
away
and
the
roisterers
sat
quietly
to
listen
it
was
not
the
first
time
ben
jonson
song
had
stilled
a
disreputable
company
i
sent
thee
late
a
rosy
wreath
not
so
much
honoring
thee
as
giving
it
the
hope
that
there
it
might
not
withered
perhaps
just
then
vanrevel
would
have
wished
to
hear
him
sing
anything
in
the
world
rather
than
that
for
on
crailey
lips
it
carried
too
much
meaning
tonight
after
the
voice
in
the
garden
and
tom
lingered
no
more
near
the
betraying
sliver
of
light
beneath
the
door
than
he
had
by
the
gap
in
the
hedge
but
went
steadily
on
his
way
not
far
from
the
hotel
he
passed
a
small
building
brightly
lighted
and
echoing
with
unusual
clamors
of
industry
the
office
of
the
rouen
journal
the
press
was
going
and
cummings
thin
figure
crossed
and
recrossed
the
windows
while
his
voice
could
be
heard
energetically
bidding
his
assistants
to
look
alive
so
that
tom
imagined
that
something
might
have
happened
between
the
nueces
river
and
the
rio
grande
but
he
did
not
stop
to
ask
the
journalist
for
he
desired
to
behold
the
face
of
none
of
his
friends
until
he
had
fought
out
some
things
within
himself
so
he
strode
on
toward
nowhere
day
was
breaking
when
gray
climbed
the
stairs
to
his
room
there
were
two
flights
the
ascent
of
the
first
of
which
occupied
about
half
an
hour
of
crailey
invaluable
time
and
the
second
might
have
taken
more
of
it
or
possibly
consumed
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
had
he
received
no
assistance
but
as
he
reclined
to
meditate
upon
the
first
landing
another
man
entered
the
hallway
from
without
ascended
quickly
and
crailey
became
pleasantly
conscious
that
two
strong
hands
had
lifted
him
to
his
feet
and
presently
that
he
was
being
borne
aloft
upon
the
back
it
seemed
quite
a
journey
yet
the
motion
was
soothing
so
he
made
no
effort
to
open
his
eyes
until
he
found
himself
gently
deposited
upon
the
couch
in
his
own
chamber
when
he
smiled
amiably
and
looking
up
discovered
his
partner
standing
over
him
tom
was
very
pale
and
there
were
deep
violet
scrawls
beneath
his
eyes
for
once
in
his
life
he
had
come
home
later
than
crailey
first
time
you
know
said
crailey
with
difficulty
you
admit
first
time
completely
incapable
often
needed
guiding
hand
but
never
quite
yes
said
tom
quietly
it
is
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
you
quite
think
i
must
be
growing
old
and
constitution
refuses
bear
it
disgraceful
to
be
seen
in
condition
yet
celebration
justified
for
the
news
he
waved
his
hand
wildly
old
red
white
and
blue
american
eagle
now
kindly
proceed
to
scream
starspangled
banner
intends
streaming
to
all
the
trade
winds
sea
to
sea
glorious
victories
on
political
thieving
exhibition
no
expedition
everybody
not
responsible
for
the
trouble
to
go
and
get
himself
patriotically
killed
what
do
you
mean
water
said
the
other
feebly
tom
brought
the
pitcher
and
crailey
setting
his
hot
lips
to
it
drank
long
and
deeply
then
with
his
friend
assistance
he
tied
a
heavily
moistened
towel
round
his
head
all
right
very
soon
and
sober
again
he
muttered
and
lay
back
upon
the
pillow
with
eyes
tightly
closed
in
an
intense
effort
to
concentrate
his
will
when
he
opened
them
again
four
or
five
minutes
later
they
had
marvellously
cleared
and
his
look
was
and
sane
have
you
heard
the
news
he
spoke
much
more
easily
now
it
came
at
midnight
to
the
no
i
been
walking
in
the
the
mexicans
crossed
the
rio
grande
on
the
of
last
month
captured
captain
thornton
and
murdered
colonel
crook
that
means
war
is
it
has
been
certain
for
a
long
time
said
tom
polk
has
forced
it
from
the
then
it
a
devil
of
a
pity
he
ca
be
the
only
man
to
die
have
they
called
for
volunteers
asked
tom
going
toward
the
door
no
but
if
the
news
is
true
they
yes
said
tom
and
as
he
reached
the
hallway
he
paused
can
i
help
you
to
undress
certainly
not
crailey
sat
up
indignantly
ca
you
see
that
perfectly
sober
it
was
the
merest
temporary
fit
and
i
shaken
it
off
do
you
see
he
got
upon
his
feet
staggered
but
shook
himself
like
a
dog
coming
out
of
the
water
and
came
to
the
door
with
infirm
steps
you
going
to
bed
are
you
asked
tom
you
much
no
answered
crailey
are
you
no
i
going
to
you
been
all
up
night
too
have
you
crailey
put
his
hand
on
the
other
shoulder
were
you
hunting
for
me
no
not
last
crailey
lurched
suddenly
and
tom
caught
him
about
the
waist
to
steady
him
sweethearting
tippling
or
poker
eh
tom
he
shouted
thickly
with
a
wild
laugh
ha
ha
old
up
to
my
bad
tricks
at
last
but
recovering
himself
immediately
he
pushed
the
other
off
at
arm
length
and
slapped
himself
smartly
on
the
brow
never
mind
all
right
all
right
only
a
bad
wave
now
and
then
a
walk
will
make
me
more
a
man
than
you
much
better
go
to
bed
i
ca
i
going
to
change
my
clothes
and
go
why
crailey
did
not
answer
but
at
that
moment
the
catholic
summoning
the
faithful
to
mass
pealed
loudly
on
the
morning
air
and
the
steady
glance
of
tom
vanrevel
rested
upon
the
reckless
eyes
of
the
man
beside
him
as
they
listened
together
to
its
insistent
call
tom
said
gently
almost
timidly
you
have
an
engagement
this
time
the
answer
came
briskly
yes
i
promised
to
take
fanchon
to
the
cemetery
before
breakfast
to
place
some
flowers
on
the
grave
of
the
little
brother
who
died
this
happens
to
be
his
it
was
tom
who
averted
his
eyes
not
crailey
then
you
best
hurry
he
said
hesitatingly
i
must
keep
you
and
went
downstairs
to
his
office
with
flushed
cheeks
a
hanging
head
and
an
expression
which
would
have
led
a
stranger
to
believe
that
he
had
just
been
caught
in
a
lie
he
went
to
the
main
street
window
and
seated
himself
upon
the
ledge
the
only
one
in
the
room
not
too
dusty
for
occupation
for
here
at
this
hour
tom
had
taken
his
place
every
morning
since
elizabeth
carewe
had
come
from
the
convent
the
window
was
a
coign
of
vantage
commanding
the
corner
of
carewe
and
main
streets
some
distance
west
of
the
corner
the
catholic
church
cast
its
long
shadow
across
main
street
and
in
order
to
enter
the
church
a
person
who
lived
upon
carewe
street
must
pass
the
corner
or
else
make
a
detour
and
approach
from
the
other
direction
which
the
person
never
did
tom
had
thought
it
out
the
first
night
that
the
image
of
miss
betty
had
kept
him
awake
and
that
was
the
first
night
miss
carewe
spent
in
rouen
the
mary
girl
would
be
sure
to
go
to
mass
every
day
which
was
why
the
was
dusted
the
next
morning
the
glass
doors
of
the
little
corner
caught
the
early
sun
of
the
hot
may
morning
and
became
like
sheets
of
polished
brass
a
wagon
rattled
down
the
dusty
street
a
group
of
irish
waitresses
from
the
hotel
made
the
boardwalk
rattle
under
their
hurried
steps
as
they
went
toward
the
church
talking
busily
to
one
another
and
a
blinking
youth
in
his
who
wore
the
air
of
one
newly
but
not
gladly
risen
began
to
struggle
mournfully
with
the
shutters
of
madrillon
bank
a
moment
later
tom
heard
crailey
come
down
the
stairs
sure
of
foot
and
humming
lightly
to
himself
the
door
of
the
office
was
closed
crailey
did
not
look
in
but
presently
appeared
smiling
trim
immaculate
all
in
white
linen
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
and
offered
badinage
to
the
boy
who
toiled
at
the
shutters
the
bell
had
almost
ceased
to
ring
when
a
lady
dressed
plainly
in
black
but
graceful
and
tall
came
rapidly
out
of
carewe
street
turned
at
the
corner
by
the
little
and
went
toward
the
church
the
boy
was
left
staring
for
crailey
banter
broke
off
in
the
middle
of
a
word
he
overtook
her
on
the
church
steps
and
they
went
in
together
that
afternoon
fanchon
bareaud
told
tom
how
beautiful
her
betrothed
had
been
to
her
he
had
brought
her
a
great
bouquet
of
violets
and
and
had
taken
her
to
the
cemetery
to
place
them
on
the
grave
of
her
baby
brother
whose
birthday
it
was
tears
came
to
fanchon
eyes
as
she
spoke
of
her
lover
goodness
and
of
how
wonderfully
he
had
talked
as
they
stood
beside
the
little
grave
he
was
the
only
one
who
remembered
that
this
was
poor
tiny
birthday
she
said
and
sobbed
he
came
just
after
breakfast
and
asked
me
to
go
out
there
with
chapter
xii
the
room
in
the
cupola
carewe
returned
one
warm
may
afternoon
by
the
six
boat
which
was
sometimes
a
day
late
and
sometimes
a
few
hours
early
the
latter
contingency
arising
as
in
the
present
instance
when
the
owner
was
aboard
nelson
drove
him
from
the
wharf
to
the
bank
where
he
conferred
briefly
in
an
undertone
with
eugene
madrillon
after
which
eugene
sent
a
note
containing
three
words
to
tappingham
marsh
marsh
tore
up
the
note
and
sauntered
over
to
the
club
where
he
found
general
trumble
and
jefferson
bareaud
amicably
discussing
a
pitcher
of
cherry
bounce
he
has
come
said
tappingham
pleased
to
find
the
pair
the
only
occupants
of
the
place
he
saw
madrillon
and
there
a
session
praise
the
lord
exclaimed
the
stout
general
rising
to
his
feet
i
see
old
chenoweth
at
once
my
fingers
have
the
and
mine
too
said
bareaud
i
begun
to
think
we
never
have
a
go
with
him
you
must
see
that
crailey
comes
we
want
a
full
table
drag
him
if
you
ca
get
him
any
other
he
wo
need
urging
said
jefferson
but
he
cut
us
last
he
wo
cut
tonight
what
hour
nine
answered
tappingham
it
to
be
a
full
sitting
do
fear
for
us
laughed
trumble
nor
for
crailey
jefferson
added
after
so
long
a
vacation
you
could
keep
him
away
if
you
chained
him
to
the
pillars
he
tear
in
two
here
to
our
better
fortunes
then
said
the
old
soldier
filling
a
glass
for
tappingham
and
here
to
our
better
fortunes
echoed
the
young
men
pouring
off
the
gentle
liquor
heartily
having
thus
made
libation
to
their
particular
god
the
trio
separated
but
jefferson
did
not
encounter
the
alacrity
of
acceptance
he
expected
from
crailey
when
he
found
him
half
an
hour
later
at
the
hotel
bar
indeed
at
first
gray
not
only
refused
outright
to
go
but
seriously
urged
the
same
course
upon
jefferson
moreover
his
remonstrance
was
offered
in
such
evident
good
faith
that
bareaud
in
the
act
of
swallowing
one
of
his
large
doses
of
quinine
paused
with
only
half
the
powder
down
his
throat
gazing
nonplussed
at
his
prospective
my
immortal
soul
he
gasped
is
this
crailey
gray
what
the
trouble
nothing
replied
crailey
quietly
only
do
go
you
lost
well
you
a
beautiful
one
jefferson
exclaimed
with
an
incredulous
laugh
you
a
master
hand
you
to
talk
about
losing
enough
i
know
i
know
crailey
began
shaking
his
head
but
you
promised
fanchon
never
to
go
again
and
you
afraid
miss
betty
will
see
or
hear
us
and
tell
her
you
were
i
do
know
miss
then
you
need
fear
besides
she
be
out
when
we
come
and
asleep
when
we
go
she
will
never
know
we
been
in
the
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
crailey
impatiently
and
he
was
the
more
earnest
because
he
remembered
the
dangerous
geography
of
the
carewe
house
which
made
it
impossible
for
anyone
to
leave
the
except
by
the
long
hall
which
passed
certain
doors
i
will
not
go
and
what
more
i
promised
fanchon
i
try
to
keep
you
out
of
it
lord
but
we
virtuous
laughed
the
incredulous
jefferson
come
for
you
at
a
quarter
to
i
will
not
go
i
tell
jefferson
roared
yes
you
will
you
could
keep
from
it
if
you
tried
and
he
took
himself
off
laughing
violently
again
promising
to
call
for
crailey
on
his
way
to
the
tryst
and
leaving
him
still
warmly
protesting
that
it
would
be
a
great
folly
for
either
of
them
to
go
crailey
looked
after
the
lad
long
thin
figure
with
an
expression
as
near
anger
as
he
ever
wore
he
go
he
said
to
himself
and
ah
well
i
have
to
risk
it
i
go
with
him
but
only
to
try
and
bring
him
away
early
that
is
as
early
as
it
safe
to
be
sure
that
they
are
asleep
downstairs
and
i
wo
play
no
i
not
play
not
he
paid
his
score
and
went
out
of
the
hotel
by
a
side
door
some
distance
up
the
street
bareaud
was
still
to
be
seen
lounging
homeward
in
the
pleasant
afternoon
sunshine
he
stopped
on
a
corner
and
serenely
poured
another
quinine
powder
into
himself
and
threw
the
paper
to
a
couple
of
pigs
who
looked
up
from
the
gutter
maliciously
confound
him
said
crailey
laughing
ruefully
he
makes
me
a
missionary
for
i
keep
my
word
to
fanchon
in
that
at
least
look
after
jefferson
tonight
ah
i
might
as
well
be
old
tom
vanrevel
indeed
meanwhile
carewe
had
taken
possession
of
his
own
again
his
daughter
ran
to
the
door
to
meet
him
she
was
trembling
a
little
and
blushing
and
smiling
held
out
both
her
hands
to
him
so
that
tanberry
vowed
this
was
the
loveliest
creature
in
the
world
and
the
kindest
carewe
bowed
slightly
as
to
an
acquaintance
and
disregarded
the
extended
hands
at
that
the
blush
faded
from
miss
betty
cheeks
she
trembled
no
more
and
a
salutation
as
icy
as
her
father
was
returned
to
him
he
bent
his
heavy
brows
upon
her
and
shot
a
black
glance
her
way
being
of
course
immediately
enraged
by
her
reflection
of
his
own
manner
but
he
did
not
speak
to
her
nor
did
he
once
address
her
during
the
evening
meal
preferring
to
honor
tanberry
with
his
conversation
to
that
diplomatic
lady
secret
anger
but
outward
amusement
she
cheerfully
neglected
to
answer
him
at
times
having
not
the
slightest
awe
of
him
and
turned
to
the
girl
instead
indeed
she
was
only
prevented
from
rating
him
soundly
at
his
own
table
by
the
fear
that
she
might
make
the
situation
more
difficult
for
her
young
charge
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
she
made
her
escape
with
miss
betty
and
they
drove
away
in
the
twilight
to
pay
visits
of
duty
leaving
carewe
frowning
at
his
coffee
on
the
veranda
when
they
came
home
three
hours
later
miss
betty
noticed
that
a
fringe
of
illumination
bordered
each
of
the
heavily
curtained
windows
in
the
cupola
and
she
uttered
an
exclamation
for
she
had
never
known
that
room
to
be
lighted
look
she
cried
touching
tanberry
arm
as
the
horses
trotted
through
the
gates
under
a
drizzle
of
rain
i
thought
the
room
in
the
cupola
was
empty
it
always
locked
and
when
i
came
from
mary
he
told
me
that
old
furniture
was
stored
tanberry
was
grateful
for
the
darkness
he
may
have
gone
there
to
read
she
answered
in
a
queer
voice
let
us
go
quietly
to
bed
child
so
as
not
to
disturb
betty
had
as
little
desire
to
disturb
her
father
as
she
had
to
see
him
therefore
she
obeyed
her
friend
injunction
and
went
to
her
room
on
the
house
was
very
silent
as
she
lit
the
candles
on
her
bureau
outside
the
gentle
drizzle
and
the
soothing
tinkle
from
the
eaves
were
the
only
sounds
within
there
was
but
the
faint
rustle
of
garments
from
tanberry
room
presently
the
latter
ceased
to
be
heard
and
a
wooden
moan
of
protest
from
the
upon
which
the
good
lady
reposed
announced
that
she
had
drawn
the
curtains
and
wooed
the
rulers
of
nod
although
it
was
one
of
those
nights
of
which
they
say
it
is
a
good
night
to
sleep
miss
betty
was
not
drowsy
she
had
one
small
sandal
but
she
tied
the
ribbons
again
and
seated
herself
by
the
open
window
the
ledge
and
casement
framed
a
dim
oblong
of
thin
light
from
the
candles
behind
her
a
lonely
lustre
which
crossed
the
veranda
to
melt
shapelessly
into
darkness
on
the
soggy
lawn
she
felt
a
melancholy
in
the
softly
falling
rain
and
wet
black
foliage
that
chimed
with
the
sadness
of
her
own
spirit
the
night
suited
her
very
well
for
her
father
coming
had
brought
a
weight
of
depression
with
it
why
could
he
not
have
spoken
one
word
to
her
even
a
cross
one
she
knew
that
he
did
not
love
her
yet
merely
as
a
she
was
entitled
to
a
measure
of
courtesy
and
the
fact
that
she
was
his
daughter
could
not
excuse
his
failure
to
render
it
was
she
to
continue
to
live
with
him
on
their
present
terms
she
had
no
intention
to
make
another
effort
to
alter
them
but
to
remain
as
they
were
would
be
intolerable
and
tanberry
could
not
stay
forever
to
act
as
a
buffer
between
her
and
her
father
peering
out
into
the
dismal
night
she
found
her
own
future
as
black
and
it
seemed
no
wonder
that
the
sisters
loved
the
convent
life
that
the
pale
nuns
forsook
the
world
wherein
there
was
so
much
useless
unkindness
where
women
were
petty
and
jealous
like
that
cowardly
fanchon
and
men
who
looked
great
were
tricksters
like
fanchon
betrothed
miss
betty
clenched
her
delicate
fingers
she
would
not
remember
that
white
startled
face
again
another
face
helped
her
to
shut
out
the
recollection
that
of
the
man
who
had
come
to
mass
to
meet
her
yesterday
morning
and
with
whom
she
had
taken
a
long
walk
afterward
he
had
shown
her
a
quaint
old
english
gardener
who
lived
on
the
bank
of
the
river
had
bought
her
a
bouquet
and
she
had
helped
him
to
select
another
to
send
to
a
sick
friend
how
beautiful
the
flowers
were
and
how
happy
he
had
made
the
morning
for
her
with
his
gayety
his
lightness
and
his
odd
wisdom
was
it
only
yesterday
her
father
coming
had
made
yesterday
a
fortnight
old
but
the
continuously
pattering
rain
and
the
soft
from
the
roof
though
as
mournful
as
she
chose
to
find
them
began
afterwhile
to
weave
their
somnolent
spells
and
she
slowly
drifted
from
reveries
of
unhappy
sorts
into
in
which
she
was
still
aware
she
was
awake
yet
slumber
stirring
from
the
curtains
beside
her
with
the
small
night
breeze
breathed
strange
distortions
upon
familiar
things
and
drowsy
impossibilities
moved
upon
the
surface
of
her
thoughts
her
chin
resting
upon
her
hand
sank
gently
until
her
head
almost
lay
upon
her
relaxed
arms
that
is
mine
crailey
gray
she
sprang
to
her
feet
immeasurably
startled
one
hand
clutching
the
back
of
her
chair
the
other
tremulously
pressed
to
her
cheek
convinced
that
her
father
had
stooped
over
her
and
shouted
the
sentence
in
her
ear
for
it
was
his
voice
and
the
house
rang
with
the
words
all
the
rooms
halls
and
even
the
walls
seemed
still
murmurous
with
the
sudden
sound
like
the
tingling
of
a
bell
after
it
had
been
struck
and
yet
everything
was
quiet
she
pressed
her
fingers
to
her
forehead
trying
to
untangle
the
maze
of
dreams
which
had
evolved
this
shock
for
her
the
sudden
clamor
in
her
father
voice
of
a
name
she
hated
and
hoped
never
to
hear
again
a
name
she
was
trying
to
forget
but
as
she
was
unable
to
trace
anything
which
had
led
to
it
there
remained
only
the
conclusion
that
her
nerves
were
not
what
they
should
be
the
vapors
having
become
obsolete
for
young
ladies
as
an
explanation
for
all
unpleasant
sensations
they
were
instructed
to
have
this
was
miss
betty
first
consciousness
of
her
own
and
desiring
no
greater
acquaintance
with
them
she
told
herself
it
was
unwholesome
to
fall
asleep
in
a
chair
by
an
open
window
when
the
night
was
as
sad
as
she
turning
to
a
chair
in
front
of
the
small
oval
mirror
of
her
bureau
she
unclasped
the
brooch
which
held
her
lace
collar
and
seating
herself
began
to
unfasten
her
hair
suddenly
she
paused
her
uplifted
arms
falling
mechanically
to
her
sides
someone
was
coming
through
the
long
hall
with
a
soft
almost
inaudible
step
a
step
which
was
not
her
father
she
knew
at
once
with
instinctive
certainty
that
it
was
not
he
nor
was
it
nelson
who
would
have
shuffled
nor
could
it
be
the
vain
mamie
nor
one
of
the
other
servants
for
they
did
not
sleep
in
the
house
it
was
a
step
more
like
a
woman
though
certainly
it
was
not
tanberry
betty
rose
took
a
candle
and
stood
silent
for
a
moment
the
heavy
tresses
of
her
hair
falling
upon
her
neck
and
left
shoulder
like
the
folds
of
a
dark
drapery
at
the
slight
rustle
of
her
rising
the
steps
ceased
instantly
her
heart
set
up
a
wild
beating
and
the
candle
shook
in
her
hand
but
she
was
brave
and
young
and
following
an
irresistible
impulse
she
ran
across
the
room
flung
open
the
door
and
threw
the
light
of
the
candle
into
the
hall
holding
it
at
arm
length
before
her
she
came
almost
face
to
face
with
crailey
gray
the
blood
went
from
his
cheeks
as
a
swallow
flies
down
from
a
roof
he
started
back
against
the
opposite
wall
with
a
stifled
groan
while
she
stared
at
him
blankly
and
grew
as
deathly
pale
as
he
he
was
a
man
of
great
resource
in
all
emergencies
which
required
a
quick
tongue
but
for
the
moment
this
was
beyond
him
he
felt
himself
lost
toppling
backward
into
an
abyss
and
the
uselessness
of
his
destruction
made
him
physically
sick
for
he
need
not
have
been
there
he
had
not
wished
to
come
he
had
well
counted
the
danger
to
himself
and
this
one
time
in
his
life
had
gone
to
the
out
of
but
bareaud
had
been
obstinate
and
crailey
had
come
away
alone
hoping
that
jefferson
might
follow
and
here
he
was
poor
trapped
rat
convicted
and
ruined
because
of
a
good
action
at
last
he
knew
consistency
to
be
a
jewel
and
that
a
greedy
boy
should
never
give
a
crust
that
a
fool
should
stick
to
his
folly
a
villain
to
his
deviltry
and
each
hold
his
own
for
the
man
who
thrusts
a
good
deed
into
a
life
of
lies
is
wound
about
with
perilous
passes
and
in
his
devious
ways
a
thousand
unexpected
damnations
spring
beaten
stunned
with
despair
he
returned
her
long
dumfounded
gaze
hopelessly
and
told
the
truth
like
an
inspired
dunce
i
came
i
came
to
bring
another
man
away
he
whispered
brokenly
and
at
the
very
moment
several
heavy
voices
broke
into
eager
talk
overhead
the
white
hand
that
held
the
candle
wavered
and
the
shadows
glided
in
a
huge
grotesque
dance
twice
she
essayed
to
speak
before
she
could
do
so
at
the
same
moment
motioning
him
back
for
he
had
made
a
vague
gesture
toward
her
i
am
not
faint
do
you
mean
away
from
up
there
she
pointed
to
the
you
seen
my
father
the
question
came
out
of
such
a
depth
of
incredulousness
that
it
was
more
an
articulation
of
the
lips
than
a
sound
but
he
caught
it
and
with
it
not
hope
but
the
shadow
of
a
shadow
of
hope
a
hand
waving
from
the
far
shore
to
the
swimmer
who
has
been
down
twice
did
she
fear
for
his
sake
no
i
have
not
seen
he
was
groping
blindly
you
did
not
come
from
that
how
did
you
enter
the
house
the
draught
through
the
hall
was
blowing
upon
him
the
double
doors
upon
the
veranda
had
been
left
open
for
coolness
there
he
said
pointing
to
them
but
i
heard
you
come
from
the
other
he
was
breathing
quickly
he
saw
his
chance
if
jefferson
bareaud
did
not
come
now
you
did
not
hear
me
come
down
the
he
leaned
toward
her
risking
it
all
on
that
ah
a
sigh
too
like
a
gasp
burst
from
crailey
his
head
lifted
a
little
and
his
eyes
were
luminous
with
an
eagerness
that
was
almost
anguish
he
set
his
utmost
will
at
work
to
collect
himself
and
to
think
hard
and
fast
i
came
here
resolved
to
take
a
man
away
come
what
would
he
said
i
found
the
door
open
went
to
the
foot
of
that
stairway
then
i
stopped
i
remembered
something
i
turned
and
was
going
away
when
you
opened
the
you
remembered
what
her
strained
attitude
did
not
relax
nor
to
his
utmost
scrutiny
was
the
complete
astonishment
of
her
distended
gaze
altered
one
whit
but
a
hint
of
her
accustomed
high
color
was
again
upon
her
cheek
and
her
lip
trembled
a
little
like
that
of
a
child
about
to
weep
the
flicker
of
hope
in
his
breast
increased
prodigiously
and
the
rush
of
it
took
the
breath
from
his
throat
and
choked
him
good
god
was
she
going
to
believe
him
i
remembered
you
what
she
said
wonderingly
art
returned
with
a
splendid
bound
his
beautiful
and
treacherous
familiar
who
had
deserted
him
at
the
crucial
instant
but
she
made
up
for
it
now
folding
him
in
protective
wings
and
breathing
through
his
spirit
in
rapid
and
vehement
whispers
he
poured
out
the
words
upon
the
girl
in
the
doorway
i
have
a
friend
and
i
would
lay
down
my
life
to
make
him
what
he
could
be
he
has
always
thrown
everything
away
his
life
his
talents
all
his
money
and
all
of
mine
for
the
sake
of
throwing
them
away
some
other
must
tell
you
about
that
room
but
it
has
ruined
my
friend
tonight
i
discovered
that
he
had
been
summoned
here
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
come
and
take
him
away
your
father
has
sworn
to
shoot
me
if
i
set
foot
in
his
house
or
on
ground
of
his
well
my
duty
was
clear
and
i
came
to
do
it
and
yet
i
stopped
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
because
because
i
remembered
that
you
were
robert
carewe
daughter
what
of
you
if
i
went
up
and
harm
came
to
me
from
your
father
for
i
swear
i
would
not
have
touched
him
you
asked
me
not
to
speak
of
things
and
i
have
obeyed
you
but
you
see
i
must
tell
you
one
thing
now
i
have
cared
for
this
friend
of
mine
more
than
for
all
else
under
heaven
but
i
turned
and
left
him
to
his
ruin
and
would
a
thousand
times
rather
than
bring
trouble
upon
you
thousand
times
ah
i
swear
it
should
be
a
thousand
times
a
thousand
he
had
paraded
in
one
speech
from
the
prisoner
dock
to
garden
and
her
eyes
were
shining
into
his
like
a
great
light
when
he
finished
go
quickly
she
whispered
go
quickly
go
quickly
but
do
you
understand
not
yet
but
i
shall
will
you
go
they
might
father
might
any
but
do
you
want
to
drive
me
quite
mad
please
go
she
laid
a
trembling
urgent
hand
upon
his
sleeve
never
until
you
tell
me
that
you
understand
replied
crailey
firmly
listening
keenly
for
the
slightest
sound
from
overhead
never
until
then
when
i
do
i
shall
tell
you
now
i
only
know
that
you
must
but
tell
me
you
must
go
there
was
a
shuffling
of
chairs
on
the
floor
overhead
and
crailey
went
he
went
even
more
hastily
than
might
have
been
expected
from
the
attitude
he
had
just
previously
assumed
realizing
this
as
he
reached
the
wet
path
he
risked
stealing
round
to
her
window
for
your
sake
he
breathed
and
having
thus
forestalled
any
trifling
imperfection
which
might
arise
in
her
recollection
of
his
exit
from
the
house
he
disappeared
kissing
his
hand
to
the
rain
as
he
ran
down
the
street
miss
betty
locked
her
door
and
pulled
close
the
curtains
of
her
window
a
numerous
but
careful
sound
of
footsteps
came
from
the
hall
went
by
her
door
and
out
across
the
veranda
silently
she
waited
until
she
heard
her
father
go
alone
to
his
room
she
took
the
candle
and
went
in
to
tanberry
she
set
the
light
upon
a
table
pulled
a
chair
close
to
the
bedside
and
placed
her
cool
hand
lightly
on
the
great
lady
forehead
is
it
very
late
child
why
are
you
not
asleep
mrs
tanberry
i
want
to
know
why
there
was
a
light
in
the
tonight
what
tanberry
rolled
herself
as
upright
as
possible
and
sat
with
blinking
eyes
i
want
to
know
what
i
am
sure
you
know
and
what
i
am
sure
everybody
knows
except
me
what
were
they
doing
there
tonight
and
what
was
the
quarrel
between
vanrevel
and
my
father
that
had
to
do
with
gray
tanberry
gazed
earnestly
into
the
girl
face
after
a
long
time
she
said
in
a
gentle
voice
child
has
it
come
to
matter
that

chapter
xiii
the
tocsin
tom
vanrevel
always
went
to
the
soon
after
the
morning
distribution
of
the
mail
that
is
to
say
about
ten
and
returned
with
the
letters
for
the
firm
of
gray
and
vanrevel
both
personal
and
official
crailey
and
he
shared
everything
even
a
box
at
the
and
in
front
of
this
box
one
morning
after
a
night
of
rain
tom
stood
staring
at
a
white
envelope
bearing
a
small
black
seal
the
address
was
in
a
writing
he
had
never
seen
before
but
the
instant
it
fell
under
his
eye
he
was
struck
with
a
distinctly
pleasurable
excitement
whether
through
some
spiritual
exhalation
of
the
writer
fragrant
on
any
missive
or
because
of
a
hundred
microscopic
impressions
there
are
analysts
who
are
able
to
select
from
a
pile
of
letters
written
by
women
for
the
writing
of
women
exhibits
certain
phenomena
more
determinably
than
that
of
men
those
of
the
prettiest
or
otherwise
most
attractive
and
out
upon
the
lover
who
does
not
recognize
his
mistress
hand
at
the
first
glimpse
ever
he
has
of
it
without
or
other
information
to
aid
him
thus
vanrevel
worn
and
sallow
in
the
rouen
held
the
one
letter
separate
from
a
dozen
the
latter
not
indeed
from
women
and
stared
at
it
until
a
little
color
came
back
to
his
dark
skin
and
a
great
deal
of
brightness
to
his
eye
he
was
no
analyst
of
handwritings
yet
it
came
to
him
instantly
that
this
note
was
from
a
pretty
woman
to
see
that
it
was
from
a
woman
was
simple
but
that
he
knew
and
he
did
know
that
she
was
pretty
savors
of
the
occult
more
than
this
there
was
something
about
it
that
thrilled
him
suddenly
and
without
reason
he
knew
that
it
came
from
elizabeth
carewe
he
walked
back
quickly
to
his
office
with
the
letter
in
the
left
pocket
of
his
coat
threw
the
bundle
of
general
correspondence
upon
his
desk
went
up
to
the
floor
above
and
paused
at
his
own
door
to
listen
deep
breathing
from
across
the
hall
indicated
that
gray
soul
was
still
encased
in
slumber
and
great
was
its
need
as
tom
had
found
his
partner
that
morning
at
five
stretched
upon
the
horsehair
sofa
in
the
office
lamenting
the
emptiness
of
a
bottle
which
had
been
filled
with
fiery
bourbon
in
the
afternoon
vanrevel
went
to
his
own
room
locked
the
door
and
took
the
letter
from
his
pocket
he
held
it
between
his
fingers
carefully
as
though
it
were
alive
and
very
fragile
and
he
looked
at
it
a
long
time
holding
it
first
in
one
hand
then
in
the
other
before
he
opened
it
at
last
however
after
examining
all
the
blades
of
his
pocketknife
he
selected
one
brighter
than
the
others
and
loosened
the
flap
of
the
envelope
as
gently
and
carefully
as
if
it
had
been
the
petal
of
a
that
he
was
opening
dear
vanrevel
i
believed
you
last
night
though
i
did
not
understand
but
i
understand
now
everything
and
bitter
to
me
as
the
truth
is
i
must
show
you
plainly
that
i
know
all
of
it
nor
can
i
rest
until
i
do
show
you
i
want
you
to
answer
this
letter
though
i
must
not
see
you
again
for
a
long
time
and
in
your
answer
you
must
set
me
right
if
i
am
anywhere
mistaken
in
what
i
have
learned
at
first
and
until
after
the
second
time
we
met
i
did
not
believe
in
your
heart
though
i
did
in
your
mind
and
humor
even
since
then
there
have
come
strange
small
inexplicable
mistrustings
of
you
but
now
i
throw
them
all
away
and
trust
you
wholly
monsieur
citizen
georges
meilbac
i
shall
always
think
of
you
in
those
impossible
garnishments
of
my
poor
and
i
persuade
myself
that
he
must
have
been
a
little
like
you
i
trust
you
because
i
have
heard
the
story
of
your
profound
goodness
the
first
reason
for
my
father
dislike
was
your
belief
in
freedom
as
the
right
of
all
men
ah
it
is
not
your
pretty
exaggerations
and
flatteries
i
laugh
at
them
that
speak
for
you
but
your
career
itself
and
the
brave
things
you
have
done
my
father
dislike
flared
into
hatred
because
you
worsted
him
when
he
discovered
that
he
could
not
successfully
defend
the
wrong
against
you
and
fell
back
upon
sheer
insult
he
is
a
man
whom
i
do
not
know
strange
as
that
seems
as
i
write
it
it
is
only
to
you
who
have
taught
me
so
much
that
i
could
write
it
i
have
tried
to
know
him
and
to
realize
that
i
am
his
daughter
but
we
are
the
coldest
acquaintances
that
is
all
and
i
can
not
see
how
a
change
could
come
i
do
not
understand
him
least
of
all
do
i
understand
why
he
is
a
gambler
it
has
been
explained
to
me
that
it
is
his
great
passion
but
all
i
comprehend
in
these
words
is
that
they
are
full
of
shame
for
his
daughter
this
is
what
was
told
me
he
has
always
played
heavily
and
skillfully
adding
much
to
his
estate
in
that
way
and
in
rouen
always
with
a
certain
coterie
which
was
joined
several
years
ago
by
the
man
you
came
to
save
last
night
your
devotion
to
gray
has
been
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
your
life
i
know
all
that
the
town
knows
of
that
except
the
thousand
hidden
sacrifices
you
have
made
for
him
those
things
which
no
one
will
ever
know
and
yet
you
see
i
know
them
after
all
for
your
sake
because
you
love
him
i
will
not
even
call
him
unworthy
i
have
heard
from
one
who
told
unwillingly
the
story
of
the
night
two
years
ago
when
the
play
ran
so
terribly
high
and
how
in
the
morning
when
they
went
away
all
were
poorer
except
one
their
host
how
gray
had
nothing
left
in
the
world
and
owed
my
father
a
great
sum
which
was
to
be
paid
in
hours
how
you
took
everything
you
had
saved
in
the
years
of
hard
work
at
your
profession
and
borrowed
the
rest
on
your
word
and
brought
it
to
my
father
that
afternoon
how
when
you
had
paid
your
friend
debt
you
asked
my
father
not
to
play
with
gray
again
and
my
father
made
that
his
excuse
to
send
you
a
challenge
you
laughed
at
the
challenge
and
you
could
afford
to
laugh
at
it
but
this
is
all
shame
shame
for
robert
carewe
daughter
it
seems
to
me
that
i
should
hide
and
not
lift
my
head
that
i
being
of
my
blood
could
never
look
you
in
the
face
again
it
is
so
unspeakably
painful
and
ugly
i
think
of
my
father
stiff
pride
and
his
look
of
the
eagle
and
he
still
plays
with
your
friend
almost
always
and
your
friend
still
comes
to
play
but
i
will
not
speak
of
that
side
of
it
mr
gray
has
made
you
poor
but
i
know
it
was
not
that
which
made
you
come
seeking
him
last
night
when
i
found
you
there
in
the
hail
it
was
for
his
sake
you
came
and
you
went
away
for
mine
now
that
i
know
at
last
now
that
i
have
heard
what
your
life
has
been
and
oh
i
heard
so
much
more
than
i
have
written
now
that
my
eyes
have
been
opened
to
see
you
as
you
are
i
am
proud
and
glad
and
humble
that
i
can
believe
that
you
felt
a
friendship
for
me
strong
enough
to
have
made
you
go
my
sake
you
will
write
to
me
just
once
wo
you
and
tell
me
if
there
was
any
error
in
what
i
listened
to
but
you
must
not
come
to
the
garden
now
that
i
know
you
i
can
not
meet
you
clandestinely
again
it
would
hurt
the
dignity
which
i
feel
in
you
now
and
my
own
poor
dignity
such
as
it
is
i
have
been
earnestly
warned
of
the
danger
to
you
besides
you
must
let
me
test
myself
i
am
all
fluttering
and
frightened
and
excited
you
will
obey
me
wo
you
do
not
come
until
i
send
for
you
elizabeth
gray
occupied
with
his
toilet
about
noon
heard
his
partner
descending
to
the
office
with
a
heavy
step
and
issued
from
his
room
to
call
a
hearty
greeting
tom
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
and
replied
cheerily
though
with
a
certain
embarrassment
but
crailey
catching
sight
of
his
face
uttered
a
sharp
ejaculation
and
came
down
to
him
why
what
the
matter
tom
you
not
going
to
be
sick
you
look
like
the
devil
and
all
i
all
right
never
fear
tom
laughed
evading
the
other
eye
going
out
in
the
country
on
some
business
and
i
dare
say
i
shall
not
be
back
for
a
couple
of
days
it
will
be
all
up
and
down
the
he
set
down
a
he
was
carrying
and
offered
the
other
his
hand
ca
i
go
for
you
you
do
look
no
no
it
something
i
have
to
attend
to
ah
i
suppose
said
crailey
gently
i
suppose
it
important
and
you
could
trust
me
to
handle
it
well
god
knows
you
right
shown
you
often
enough
how
incompetent
i
am
to
do
anything
but
write
jingles
you
do
some
more
of
them
without
the
whiskey
crailey
they
worth
more
than
all
the
lawing
gray
and
vanrevel
have
ever
done
or
ever
will
do
be
kind
to
he
descended
to
the
first
landing
and
then
oh
crailey
he
called
with
the
air
of
having
forgotten
something
he
had
meant
to
say
yes
tom
this
morning
at
the
i
found
a
letter
addressed
to
me
i
opened
it
and
he
hesitated
and
uneasily
shifted
his
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other
with
a
feeble
deprecatory
laugh
yes
what
of
it
well
there
seemed
to
be
a
mistake
i
think
it
must
have
been
meant
for
you
somehow
she
she
picked
up
a
good
many
wrong
impressions
and
lord
knows
how
but
she
mixed
our
names
up
and
and
i
left
the
letter
for
you
it
on
my
he
turned
and
calling
a
final
over
his
shoulder
went
clattering
noisily
down
to
the
street
and
vanished
from
crailey
sight
noon
found
tom
far
out
on
the
national
road
creaking
along
over
the
yellow
dust
in
a
light
wagon
between
bordering
forests
that
smelt
spicily
of
wet
underbrush
and
and
here
and
there
when
they
would
emerge
from
the
woods
to
cleared
fields
liberally
outlined
by
long
of
black
walnut
the
steady
old
horse
lifted
his
head
and
looked
interested
in
the
world
but
tom
never
did
either
habitually
upright
walking
or
sitting
straight
keen
and
alert
that
day
sun
saw
him
drearily
hunched
over
mile
after
mile
his
forehead
laced
with
lines
of
pain
he
stopped
at
every
and
cabin
and
where
the
young
men
worked
in
the
fields
hailed
them
from
the
road
or
hitched
his
horse
to
the
fence
and
crossed
the
soft
furrows
to
talk
with
them
at
such
times
he
stood
erect
again
and
spoke
stirringly
finding
eager
listeners
there
was
one
question
they
asked
him
over
and
over
but
are
you
sure
the
call
will
come
as
sure
as
that
we
stand
here
and
it
will
come
before
the
week
is
out
we
must
be
ready
often
when
he
left
them
they
would
turn
from
the
work
in
hand
leaving
it
as
it
was
to
lie
unfinished
in
the
fields
and
make
their
way
slowly
and
thoughtfully
to
their
homes
while
tom
climbed
into
his
creaking
little
wagon
once
more
only
to
fall
into
the
same
dull
attitude
he
had
many
things
to
think
out
before
he
faced
rouen
and
crailey
gray
again
and
more
to
fight
through
to
the
end
with
himself
three
days
he
took
for
it
three
days
driving
through
the
soft
may
weather
behind
the
kind
old
horse
three
days
on
the
road
from
to
and
from
field
to
field
from
cabin
of
the
woods
to
cabin
in
the
clearing
tossing
unhappily
at
night
he
lay
sleepless
till
dawn
though
not
because
of
the
hard
beds
and
when
daylight
came
journeyed
steadily
on
again
over
the
vagabond
little
hills
that
had
gypsied
it
so
far
into
the
in
their
wanderings
from
their
range
on
the
ohio
and
passing
the
hills
went
on
through
the
flat
always
hunched
over
dismally
in
the
creaking
wagon
but
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
he
drove
into
town
with
the
stoop
out
of
his
shoulders
and
the
lustre
back
in
his
eyes
he
was
haggard
gray
dusty
but
he
had
solved
his
puzzle
and
one
thing
was
clear
in
his
mind
as
the
thing
that
he
would
do
he
patted
the
old
horse
a
hearty
farewell
as
he
left
him
with
the
liveryman
from
whom
he
had
hired
him
and
strode
up
main
street
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
going
somewhere
it
was
late
but
there
were
more
lights
than
usual
in
the
windows
and
more
people
on
the
streets
boys
ran
shouting
while
here
and
there
knots
of
men
argued
loudly
and
in
front
of
the
little
corner
a
noisily
talkative
widely
gesticulative
crowd
of
fifty
or
more
had
gathered
an
old
man
a
cobbler
who
had
left
a
leg
at
tippecanoe
and
replaced
it
with
a
wooden
one
chastely
decorated
with
designs
of
his
own
carving
came
stumping
excitedly
down
the
middle
of
the
street
where
he
walked
for
fear
of
the
cracks
in
the
wooden
pavement
which
were
dangerous
to
his
when
he
came
from
the
rouen
house
bar
as
on
the
present
occasion
he
hailed
tom
by
name
you
the
lad
tom
vanrevel
he
shouted
you
the
man
to
lead
the
boys
out
for
the
glory
of
the
state
you
git
the
whole
blame
fire
out
and
enlist
before
morning
take
down
to
the
rio
grande
you
hear
me
and
you
need
be
afraid
of
their
puttin
it
out
if
it
ketches
afire
neither
tom
waved
his
hand
and
passed
on
but
at
the
open
doors
of
the
catholic
church
he
stopped
and
looked
up
and
down
the
street
and
then
unnoticed
entered
to
the
dim
interior
where
the
few
candles
showed
only
a
bent
old
woman
in
black
kneeling
at
the
altar
tom
knew
where
elizabeth
carewe
knelt
each
morning
he
stepped
softly
through
the
shadowy
silence
to
her
place
knelt
and
rested
his
head
upon
the
rail
of
the
bench
before
him
the
figure
at
the
altar
raised
itself
after
a
time
and
the
old
woman
limped
slowly
up
a
side
aisle
mumbling
her
formulas
courtesying
to
the
painted
saints
on
her
way
out
the
very
thinnest
lingerings
of
incense
hung
on
the
air
seeming
to
tom
like
the
faint
odor
that
might
exhale
from
a
heavy
wreath
of
marguerites
worn
in
hair
yet
the
place
held
nothing
but
peace
and
and
he
found
nothing
else
in
his
own
heart
the
street
was
quiet
when
he
emerged
from
that
lorn
vigil
the
corner
groups
had
dissolved
shouting
youths
no
longer
patrolled
the
sidewalks
only
one
quarter
showed
signs
of
life
the
little
clubhouse
where
the
windows
still
shown
brightly
and
whence
came
the
sound
of
many
voices
settling
the
destinies
of
the
united
states
of
america
thither
tom
bent
his
steps
thoughtfully
and
with
a
quiet
mind
there
was
a
small
veranda
at
the
side
of
the
house
here
he
stood
unobserved
to
look
in
upon
his
noisy
and
agitated
friends
they
were
all
there
from
the
old
general
and
bareaud
to
the
latter
son
jefferson
and
young
frank
chenoweth
they
were
gathered
about
a
big
table
upon
which
stood
a
and
trumble
his
brow
as
angry
red
as
the
liquor
in
the
cup
he
held
was
proposing
a
health
to
the
president
in
a
voice
of
fury
in
spite
of
all
the
crailey
grays
and
traitors
this
side
of
hell
he
finished
politely
crailey
emerged
instantaneously
from
the
general
throng
and
mounted
a
chair
tossing
his
light
hair
back
from
his
forehead
his
eyes
sparkling
and
happy
you
find
your
own
friends
already
occupying
the
place
you
mentioned
do
you
general
he
asked
general
trumble
stamped
and
shook
his
fist
you
a
spawn
of
aaron
burr
he
vociferated
there
not
a
man
here
to
stand
by
your
infernal
doctrines
you
sneer
at
your
own
state
you
sneer
at
your
own
country
you
defile
the
sacred
ground
what
are
you
by
the
almighty
who
attack
your
native
land
in
this
her
hour
of
peril
peril
to
my
native
land
laughed
crailey
from
santa
anna
the
general
right
sir
exclaimed
the
elder
chenoweth
indignantly
and
most
of
the
listeners
appeared
to
agree
with
him
it
a
poor
time
to
abuse
the
president
when
he
called
for
volunteers
and
our
country
is
in
danger
sir
who
is
in
danger
answered
crailey
lifting
his
hand
to
still
the
clamor
of
approbation
that
arose
is
polk
in
danger
or
congress
but
that
would
be
too
much
to
hope
do
you
expect
to
see
the
greasers
in
washington
no
you
idiots
you
do
yet
there
be
plenty
of
men
to
suffer
and
die
and
the
first
should
be
those
who
thrust
this
war
on
us
and
poor
little
mexico
but
it
wo
be
they
the
men
who
do
the
fighting
and
dying
will
be
the
country
boys
and
the
like
of
us
from
the
towns
while
polk
sits
planning
at
the
white
house
how
he
can
get
elected
again
i
wish
tom
were
here
confound
you
you
listen
to
him
because
he
always
has
the
facts
and
i
just
an
embroiderer
you
think
what
become
of
the
gaudy
campaign
cry
you
were
all
wearing
your
lungs
out
with
a
few
months
ago
or
fight
bah
polk
twisted
the
lion
tail
with
that
until
after
election
then
he
saw
he
had
to
make
you
forget
it
or
fight
england
and
be
ruined
so
he
forces
war
on
mexico
and
the
country
does
forget
it
that
it
he
asks
three
regiments
of
volunteers
from
this
state
to
die
of
fevers
and
get
shot
so
that
he
can
steal
another
country
and
make
his
own
elect
him
again
and
you
ask
me
to
drink
the
health
of
the
politician
who
sits
at
home
and
sends
his
fellowmen
to
die
to
fix
his
rotten
jobs
for
him
crailey
had
persuaded
himself
into
such
earnestness
that
the
depth
of
his
own
feeling
almost
choked
him
but
he
finished
roundly
in
his
beautiful
strong
voice
i
drink
for
the
good
punch
sake
but
that
health
i
see
general
trumble
in
heaven
before
i
drink
it
there
rose
at
once
a
roar
of
anger
and
disapproval
and
crailey
became
a
mere
storm
centre
amid
the
upraised
hands
gestulating
madly
at
him
as
he
stood
smiling
again
upon
his
chair
this
comes
of
living
with
tom
vanrevel
shouted
the
general
furiously
this
is
his
damned
abolition
teaching
you
only
his
echo
you
spend
half
your
life
playing
at
being
vanrevel
where
is
vanrevel
said
tappingham
marsh
ay
where
is
he
raged
trumble
hammering
the
table
till
the
glasses
rang
let
him
come
and
answer
for
his
own
teaching
it
wasted
time
to
talk
to
this
one
he
only
the
pupil
where
is
the
traitor
here
answered
a
voice
from
the
doorway
and
though
the
word
was
spoken
quietly
it
was
nevertheless
at
that
juncture
silencing
everyone
turned
toward
the
door
as
vanrevel
entered
but
the
apoplectic
general
whom
crailey
speech
had
stirred
to
a
fury
beyond
control
almost
leaped
at
tom
throat
here
the
old
granny
he
bellowed
hoarsely
he
was
ordinarily
very
fond
of
tom
here
the
master
here
the
man
whose
example
teaches
crailey
gray
to
throw
mud
at
the
flag
he
stay
here
at
home
with
crailey
of
course
and
throw
more
while
the
others
boys
march
out
to
die
under
on
the
contrary
answered
tom
raising
his
voice
i
think
you
find
crailey
gray
the
first
to
enlist
and
as
for
myself
i
raised
sixty
men
in
the
country
and
i
want
forty
more
from
rouen
in
order
to
offer
the
governor
a
full
company
so
it
come
to
king
not
the
man
polk
is
a
pitiful
trickster
but
the
country
needs
her
sons
enough
for
us
to
know
and
while
i
wo
drink
to
james
polk
he
plunged
a
cup
in
the
bowl
and
drew
it
out
brimming
i
empty
this
to
the
president
it
was
then
that
from
fifty
throats
the
long
wild
shout
went
up
that
stirred
rouen
and
woke
the
people
from
their
midnight
beds
for
half
a
mile
around
chapter
xiv
the
firm
of
gray
and
vanrevel
for
the
first
time
it
was
crailey
who
sat
waiting
for
tom
to
come
home
in
a
chair
drawn
to
his
partner
desk
in
the
dusty
office
he
arms
on
the
desk
his
chin
on
his
clenched
fists
to
redeem
the
gloom
he
had
lit
a
single
candle
which
painted
him
dimly
against
the
complete
darkness
of
his
own
shadow
like
a
very
old
portrait
whose
background
time
has
solidified
into
shapeless
browns
the
portrait
of
a
gentleman
the
cavalier
or
the
marquis
one
might
have
said
at
first
glance
not
describing
it
immediately
as
that
of
a
poet
for
there
was
no
mark
of
art
upon
crailey
not
even
in
his
hair
for
they
all
wore
it
rather
long
then
yet
there
was
a
mark
upon
him
never
more
vivid
than
as
he
sat
waiting
in
the
loneliness
of
that
night
for
tom
vanrevel
though
what
the
mark
was
and
what
its
significance
might
have
been
puzzling
to
define
perhaps
after
all
fanchon
bareaud
had
described
it
best
when
she
told
crailey
one
day
with
a
sudden
hint
of
apprehensive
tears
that
he
had
a
look
of
tom
took
his
own
time
in
coming
he
had
stayed
at
the
club
to
go
over
his
lists
so
he
had
told
crailey
with
the
general
and
old
bareaud
his
company
was
almost
complete
and
crailey
had
been
the
first
to
volunteer
to
the
dumfounding
of
trumble
who
had
proceeded
to
drink
his
health
again
and
again
but
the
lists
could
not
detain
tom
two
hours
crailey
knew
and
it
was
two
hours
since
the
new
volunteers
had
sung
the
star
spangled
banner
over
the
last
of
the
punch
and
had
left
the
club
to
tom
and
the
two
old
men
only
once
or
twice
in
that
time
had
crailey
shifted
his
position
or
altered
the
direction
of
his
set
gaze
at
nothing
but
at
last
he
rose
went
to
the
window
and
leaning
far
out
looked
down
the
street
toward
the
little
clubhouse
its
lights
were
extinguished
and
all
was
dark
up
and
down
the
street
abruptly
crailey
went
back
to
the
desk
and
blew
out
the
candle
after
which
he
sat
down
again
in
the
same
position
twenty
minutes
later
he
heard
tom
step
on
the
stair
coming
up
very
softly
crailey
waited
in
silence
until
his
partner
reached
the
landing
then
relit
the
candle
tom
he
called
come
in
please
i
been
waiting
for
there
was
a
pause
before
tom
answered
from
the
hall
i
very
tired
crailey
i
think
i
go
up
to
no
said
crailey
come
the
door
was
already
open
but
tom
turned
toward
it
reluctantly
he
stopped
at
the
threshold
and
the
two
looked
at
each
other
i
thought
you
would
come
as
long
as
you
believed
i
was
up
said
crailey
so
i
blew
out
the
light
i
sorry
i
kept
you
outside
so
crailey
i
going
away
the
other
began
i
am
to
go
over
and
see
the
governor
and
offer
him
this
company
and
i
need
sleep
so
please
no
interrupted
crailey
quietly
i
want
to
know
what
you
going
to
to
do
about
what
about
oh
tom
eyes
fell
at
once
from
his
friend
face
and
rested
upon
the
floor
slowly
he
walked
to
the
desk
and
stood
in
embarrassed
contemplation
of
the
littered
books
and
papers
while
the
other
waited
i
think
it
best
for
you
to
tell
me
said
crailey
you
think
so
tom
embarrassment
increased
visibly
and
there
was
mingled
with
it
an
odd
appearance
of
apprehension
probably
to
relieve
which
he
very
deliberately
took
two
long
cheroots
from
his
pocket
laid
one
on
the
desk
for
crailey
and
lit
the
other
himself
with
extreme
carefulness
at
the
candle
after
this
ceremonial
he
dragged
a
chair
to
the
window
tilted
back
in
it
with
his
feet
on
the
low
sill
his
back
to
the
thin
light
and
his
friend
and
said
in
a
slow
gentle
tone
well
crailey
i
suppose
you
mean
that
i
ought
to
offer
my
explanation
first
said
the
other
still
standing
well
there
is
he
did
not
speak
doggedly
or
sullenly
as
one
in
fault
but
more
with
the
air
of
a
man
curiously
ready
to
throw
all
possible
light
upon
a
cloudy
phenomenon
it
very
simple
all
that
i
know
about
it
i
went
there
first
on
the
evening
of
the
madrillon
masquerade
and
played
a
little
comedy
for
her
so
that
some
of
my
theatrical
allusions
they
were
very
illuminating
to
my
engagement
to
fanchon
made
her
believe
i
was
vanrevel
when
her
father
told
her
about
the
pair
of
us
i
discovered
that
the
night
his
warehouses
burned
and
i
saw
something
more
because
i
ca
help
seeing
such
things
that
yours
was
just
the
character
to
appeal
to
a
young
girl
fresh
from
the
convent
and
full
of
honesty
and
fine
dreams
and
fire
nobody
could
arrange
a
more
fatal
fascination
for
a
girl
of
nineteen
than
to
have
a
deadly
quarrel
with
her
father
and
that
especially
true
when
the
father
like
that
mad
brute
of
a
bob
carewe
then
too
you
more
or
less
the
town
model
of
virtue
and
popular
hero
in
spite
of
the
abolitionism
just
as
i
am
the
town
scamp
so
i
let
it
go
on
and
played
a
little
at
being
you
saying
the
things
that
you
only
think
that
was
all
it
is
strange
that
it
lasted
until
now
not
more
than
three
weeks
after
all
she
only
seen
you
four
or
five
times
and
me
not
much
oftener
no
one
speaks
of
you
to
her
and
i
kept
out
of
sight
when
others
were
about
tanberry
is
her
only
close
friend
and
naturally
would
be
apt
to
mention
that
you
are
dark
and
i
am
fair
or
to
describe
us
personally
any
more
than
you
and
i
would
mention
the
general
appearance
of
people
we
both
meet
about
town
but
you
need
tell
me
that
it
ca
last
much
longer
some
petty
unexpected
trifle
will
turn
up
of
course
all
that
i
want
to
know
is
what
you
mean
to
to
do
repeated
tom
softly
and
blew
a
long
scarf
of
smoke
out
of
the
window
ah
crailey
voice
grew
sharp
and
loud
there
are
many
things
you
need
tell
me
you
need
not
tell
me
what
i
done
to
you
nor
what
you
think
of
me
you
need
not
tell
me
that
you
have
others
to
consider
that
you
have
miss
carewe
to
think
of
do
you
suppose
i
know
that
and
you
need
not
tell
me
that
you
have
a
duty
to
fanchon
yes
tom
broke
in
his
tone
not
quite
steady
yes
i
thought
of
well
have
you
did
you
he
hesitated
but
crailey
understood
immediately
no
i
have
seen
her
but
you
yes
i
wrote
i
answered
the
yes
i
signed
your
name
i
told
you
that
i
had
just
let
things
go
on
crailey
answered
with
an
impatient
movement
of
his
hands
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
going
over
to
see
the
governor
in
the
morning
i
be
away
two
or
three
days
i
vanrevel
exclaimed
crailey
hotly
will
you
give
me
an
answer
and
not
beat
about
the
bush
any
longer
or
do
you
mean
that
you
refuse
to
answer
tom
dropped
his
cigar
upon
the
brick
with
an
abysmal
sigh
oh
no
it
is
that
he
answered
mildly
i
been
thinking
it
all
over
for
three
days
in
the
country
and
when
i
got
back
tonight
i
found
that
i
had
come
to
a
decision
without
knowing
it
and
that
i
had
come
to
it
even
before
i
started
my
leaving
the
letter
for
you
proved
it
a
little
like
this
mexican
war
a
problem
and
only
one
thing
clear
a
few
schemers
have
led
the
country
into
it
to
increase
the
and
make
us
forget
that
we
threatened
england
when
we
could
carry
out
the
threat
and
yet
if
you
look
at
it
broadly
these
are
the
smaller
things
and
they
do
not
last
the
means
by
which
the
country
grows
may
be
wrong
but
its
growth
is
right
it
is
only
destiny
working
out
through
lies
and
blood
but
the
end
will
be
good
it
is
bound
to
happen
and
you
ca
stop
it
i
believe
the
men
who
make
this
war
for
their
own
uses
will
suffer
in
for
it
but
it
is
made
and
there
only
one
thing
i
can
see
as
the
thing
for
me
to
do
they
called
me
every
name
on
earth
and
the
same
with
you
too
crailey
because
i
an
abolitionist
but
now
whether
the
country
has
sinned
or
not
a
good
many
thousand
men
have
got
to
do
the
bleeding
for
her
and
i
want
to
be
one
of
them
that
the
one
thing
that
is
plain
to
yes
returned
crailey
you
know
i
with
you
and
i
think
always
right
yes
we
all
be
on
the
way
in
a
fortnight
or
so
do
you
mean
you
wo
quarrel
with
me
because
of
that
do
you
mean
it
would
be
a
poor
time
now
when
we
all
going
out
to
take
our
chances
together
quarrel
with
you
tom
rose
and
came
to
the
desk
looking
across
it
at
his
friend
did
you
think
i
might
do
that
yes
i
thought
crailey
and
now
tom
expression
showed
desperation
it
was
that
of
a
man
whose
apprehensions
have
culminated
and
who
is
forced
to
face
a
crisis
long
expected
long
averted
but
imminent
at
last
his
eyes
fell
from
crailey
clear
gaze
and
his
hand
fidgeted
among
the
papers
on
the
desk
no
he
began
with
a
painful
lameness
and
hesitation
i
did
not
mean
it
no
i
meant
that
in
the
same
way
only
one
thing
in
this
other
this
other
affair
that
seems
so
confused
and
is
such
a
problem
only
one
thing
has
grown
clear
it
does
seem
to
me
that
that
here
he
drew
a
deep
breath
before
he
went
on
with
increasing
nervousness
that
if
you
like
a
man
and
have
lived
with
him
a
good
many
years
that
is
to
say
if
you
really
much
of
a
friend
to
him
i
do
believe
you
sit
on
a
high
seat
and
judge
him
judging
and
all
that
have
much
part
in
it
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
got
yourself
into
a
pretty
bad
yes
said
crailey
it
pretty
well
tom
looked
up
now
with
an
almost
tremulous
smile
i
believe
that
is
about
all
i
can
make
of
it
do
you
think
it
the
part
of
your
best
friend
to
expose
you
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
ever
was
a
time
when
i
ought
to
stand
by
you
it
there
was
a
silence
while
they
looked
at
each
other
across
the
desk
in
the
faint
light
tom
eye
fell
again
as
crailey
opened
his
lips
and
in
spite
of
everything
crailey
said
breathlessly
you
mean
that
you
wo
tell
how
could
i
crailey
said
tom
vanrevel
as
he
turned
away
chapter
xv
when
june
came
methought
i
met
a
damsel
fair
and
tears
were
in
her
eyes
her
head
and
arms
were
bare
i
heard
her
bursting
sighs
i
stopp
and
looked
her
in
the
face
was
then
she
sweetly
smiled
her
features
shone
with
mournful
grace
far
more
than
nature
child
with
diffident
and
downcast
eye
in
modest
tones
she
spoke
she
wiped
a
tear
and
gave
a
sigh
and
then
her
silence
broke
so
sang
tanberry
at
the
piano
relieving
the
melancholy
which
possessed
her
but
nelson
pausing
in
the
hail
to
listen
and
exceedingly
curious
concerning
the
promised
utterance
of
the
damsel
fair
was
to
suffer
disappointment
as
the
ballad
was
broken
off
abruptly
and
the
songstress
closed
the
piano
with
a
monstrous
clatter
little
doubt
may
be
entertained
that
the
noise
was
designed
to
disturb
carewe
who
sat
upon
the
veranda
consulting
a
brown
principe
and
less
that
the
intended
insult
was
accomplished
for
an
expression
of
a
vindictive
nature
was
precipitated
in
that
quarter
so
simultaneously
that
the
bang
of
the
and
the
curse
were
even
as
the
report
of
a
musket
and
the
immediate
cry
of
the
wounded
tanberry
at
once
debouched
upon
the
piazza
showing
a
vast
clouded
countenance
and
i
hope
to
heaven
you
already
had
a
headache
she
exclaimed
the
courtesy
of
your
wish
madam
carewe
replied
with
an
angry
flash
of
his
eye
is
only
equaled
by
the
kindness
of
heaven
in
answering
it
i
have
in
fact
a
headache
i
always
have
that
good
news
returned
the
lady
heartily
i
thank
you
retorted
her
host
perhaps
if
you
treated
your
daughter
even
a
decent
indian
kind
of
politeness
you
enjoy
better
ah
and
in
what
failure
to
perform
my
duty
toward
her
have
i
incurred
your
displeasure
where
is
she
now
exclaimed
the
other
excitably
where
is
she
now
i
can
not
yes
you
can
robert
carewe
tanberry
retorted
with
a
wrathful
gesture
you
know
well
enough
she
in
her
own
room
and
so
do
i
for
i
tried
to
get
in
to
comfort
her
when
i
heard
her
crying
she
in
there
with
the
door
bolted
where
you
drove
her
i
drove
her
he
sneered
yes
you
did
and
i
heard
you
do
you
think
i
could
hear
you
raging
and
storming
at
her
like
a
crazy
man
when
you
get
in
a
temper
do
you
dream
there
a
soul
in
the
neighborhood
who
does
know
it
you
a
fool
if
you
do
because
they
could
have
heard
you
swearing
down
on
main
street
if
they
listened
what
are
you
trying
to
do
to
her
break
her
spirit
or
what
because
you
do
it
or
kill
her
i
never
heard
anybody
cry
so
here
the
good
woman
own
eyes
filled
what
the
use
of
pretending
she
went
on
sorrowfully
you
spoken
to
her
kindly
since
you
came
home
do
you
suppose
i
blind
to
that
you
were
a
bad
husband
to
the
poor
child
mother
why
you
be
a
good
father
to
her
perhaps
you
might
begin
by
asking
her
to
be
a
good
daughter
to
what
has
she
done
the
night
before
i
went
away
she
ran
to
a
fire
and
behaved
there
like
a
common
street
hoyden
the
ladies
of
the
carewe
family
have
not
formerly
acquired
a
notoriety
of
that
bah
said
tanberry
the
next
morning
when
i
taxed
her
with
it
she
dutifully
defied
and
insulted
i
can
imagine
the
delicacy
with
which
you
her
what
has
that
to
do
with
your
devilish
tantrums
of
this
afternoon
robert
carewe
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
the
expression
he
returned
when
i
came
home
this
afternoon
i
found
her
reading
that
he
pointed
to
many
very
small
fragments
of
cummings
newspaper
which
were
scattered
about
the
lawn
near
the
veranda
she
was
out
here
reading
an
article
which
i
had
read
downtown
and
which
appeared
in
a
special
edition
of
that
rotten
sheet
sent
out
two
hours
well
do
you
know
what
that
article
was
madam
do
you
know
what
it
was
although
breathing
heavily
carewe
had
compelled
himself
to
a
certain
outward
calmness
but
now
in
the
uncontrollable
agitation
of
his
anger
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
struck
one
of
the
wooden
pillars
of
the
porch
a
shocking
blow
with
the
bare
knuckles
of
his
clenched
hand
do
you
know
what
it
was
it
was
a
eulogy
of
that
damned
vanrevel
it
pretended
to
be
an
account
of
the
enrollment
of
his
infernal
company
but
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
glorification
of
that
hound
his
company
a
lot
of
sneaks
who
run
like
sheep
from
the
first
greaser
elected
him
captain
yesterday
and
today
he
received
an
appointment
as
major
it
dries
the
blood
in
my
veins
to
think
of
it
that
black
dog
a
major
good
god
am
i
never
to
hear
the
last
of
him
cummings
wrote
it
the
fool
the
lying
fawning
slobbering
fool
he
ought
to
be
shot
for
it
neither
he
nor
his
paper
ever
enter
my
doors
again
and
i
took
the
dirty
sheet
from
her
hands
and
tore
it
to
pieces
yes
interposed
tanberry
it
looks
as
if
you
had
done
it
with
your
and
stamped
it
into
the
ground
oh
i
heard
you
she
said
carewe
came
close
to
her
and
gave
her
a
long
look
from
such
bitter
eyes
that
her
own
fell
before
them
if
you
been
treacherous
to
me
jane
tanberry
he
said
then
god
punish
you
if
they
met
my
daughter
and
that
man
while
i
was
away
it
is
on
your
head
i
do
ask
you
because
i
believe
if
you
knew
anything
you
lie
for
her
sake
but
i
tell
you
that
as
she
read
that
paper
she
did
not
hear
my
step
on
the
walk
nor
know
that
i
was
there
until
i
leaned
over
her
shoulder
and
i
swear
that
i
suspect
he
turned
and
walked
to
the
door
while
the
indomitable
tanberry
silenced
for
once
sank
into
the
chair
he
had
vacated
before
he
disappeared
within
the
house
he
paused
if
vanrevel
has
met
my
daughter
he
said
in
a
thick
voice
stretching
out
both
hands
in
a
strange
menacing
gesture
toward
the
town
that
lay
darkling
in
the
growing
dusk
if
he
has
addressed
one
word
to
her
or
so
much
as
allowed
his
eyes
to
rest
on
her
overlong
let
him
take
care
of
himself
oh
robert
robert
tanberry
cried
in
a
frightened
whisper
to
herself
all
the
fun
and
brightness
went
out
of
the
world
when
you
came
home
for
in
truth
the
gayety
and
which
during
the
great
lady
too
brief
reign
had
seemed
a
vital
adjunct
of
the
house
to
make
the
place
resound
with
music
and
laughter
were
now
departed
no
more
did
tanberry
extemporize
dan
tuckers
mazourkas
or
quadrilles
in
the
nor
buff
in
the
library
no
more
did
serenaders
nightly
seek
the
garden
with
instrumental
plunkings
and
vocal
gifts
of
harmony
even
the
green
bronze
boy
of
the
fountain
seemed
to
share
the
timidity
of
the
other
youths
of
the
town
where
carewe
was
concerned
for
the
goblet
he
held
aloft
no
longer
sent
a
lively
stream
leaping
into
the
sunshine
in
translucent
gambols
but
dribbled
and
dripped
upon
him
like
a
morbid
autumn
rain
the
depression
of
the
place
was
like
a
drape
of
mourning
purple
but
not
that
house
alone
lay
glum
and
there
were
other
reasons
than
the
return
of
robert
carewe
why
rouen
had
lost
the
joy
and
mirth
that
belonged
to
it
nay
the
merry
town
had
changed
beyond
all
credence
it
was
hushed
like
a
and
dolefully
murmurous
with
forebodings
of
farewell
and
sorrow
for
all
the
very
flower
of
rouen
youth
had
promised
to
follow
tom
vanrevel
on
the
long
and
arduous
journey
to
mexico
to
march
burning
miles
under
the
tropical
sun
to
face
strange
fevers
and
the
guns
of
santa
anna
few
were
the
houses
of
the
more
pretentious
sort
that
did
not
mourn
in
prospect
the
going
of
son
or
brother
or
close
friend
mothers
already
wept
not
in
secret
fathers
talked
with
husky
bravado
and
everyone
was
very
kind
to
those
who
were
to
go
speaking
to
them
gently
and
bringing
them
little
foolish
presents
nor
could
the
hearts
of
girls
now
longer
mask
as
blocks
of
ice
to
the
prospective
conquistadores
eugene
madrillon
young
brother
jean
after
a
two
wooing
of
trixie
chenoweth
that
notable
spitfire
announced
his
engagement
upon
the
day
after
his
enlistment
and
recounted
to
all
who
would
listen
how
his
termagant
fell
upon
his
neck
in
tears
when
she
heard
the
news
and
now
she
cries
about
me
all
the
time
finished
the
frank
jean
blithely
but
there
was
little
spirit
for
the
old
merriments
there
were
no
more
at
the
bareauds
no
masquerades
at
the
madrillons
no
picnics
in
the
woods
nor
excursions
on
the
river
and
no
more
did
light
feet
bear
light
hearts
through
the
mazes
of
the
intricate
schottische
the
subtle
mazourka
or
the
stately
quadrille
as
will
cummings
remarked
in
the
journal
fanchon
virginia
and
five
or
six
others
spent
their
afternoons
mournfully
and
yet
proudly
sewing
and
cutting
large
pieces
of
colored
silk
fashioning
a
great
flag
for
their
sweethearts
and
brothers
to
bear
southward
and
plant
where
stood
the
palace
of
the
montezumas
that
was
sad
work
for
fanchon
though
it
was
not
for
her
brother
sake
that
she
wept
since
as
everyone
knew
jefferson
was
already
so
full
of
malaria
and
quinine
that
the
fevers
of
the
south
and
mexico
must
find
him
invulnerable
and
even
his
mother
believed
he
would
only
thrive
and
grow
hearty
on
his
soldiering
but
about
crailey
fanchon
had
a
presentiment
more
vivid
than
any
born
of
the
natural
fears
for
his
safety
it
came
to
her
again
and
again
reappearing
in
her
dreams
she
shivered
and
started
often
as
she
worked
on
the
flag
then
bent
her
fair
head
low
over
the
gay
silks
while
the
others
glanced
at
her
sympathetically
she
had
come
to
feel
quite
sure
that
crailey
was
to
be
shot
but
i
dreamed
it
dreamed
it
six
she
cried
when
he
laughed
at
her
and
tried
to
cheer
her
and
it
comes
to
me
in
the
as
though
i
saw
it
with
my
eyes
the
picture
of
you
in
an
uniform
lying
on
the
fresh
green
grass
and
a
red
stain
just
below
the
that
shows
what
dreams
are
made
of
dear
lady
he
smiled
we
find
little
green
grass
in
mexico
and
i
only
a
corporal
so
where
the
officer
uniform
then
fanchon
wept
the
more
and
put
her
arms
about
him
while
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
must
cling
to
him
so
forever
and
thus
withhold
him
from
fulfilling
her
vision
and
that
the
gentle
pressure
of
her
arms
must
somehow
preserve
him
to
life
and
to
her
ah
you
ca
go
darling
she
sobbed
while
he
petted
her
and
tried
to
soothe
her
you
leave
me
you
belong
to
me
they
ca
ca
ca
take
you
away
from
me
and
when
the
flag
was
completed
save
for
sewing
the
stars
upon
the
blue
ground
she
took
it
away
from
the
others
and
insisted
upon
finishing
the
work
herself
to
her
own
room
she
carried
it
and
each
of
the
white
stars
that
the
young
men
of
rouen
were
to
follow
in
the
struggle
that
would
add
so
many
others
to
the
constellation
was
jewelled
with
her
tears
and
kissed
by
her
lips
as
it
took
its
place
with
its
brothers
never
were
neater
stitches
taken
for
with
every
atom
of
her
body
yearning
to
receive
the
shot
that
was
destined
for
crailey
this
quiet
sewing
was
all
that
she
could
do
she
would
have
followed
him
to
hold
a
parasol
over
him
under
the
dangerous
sun
to
cook
his
meals
properly
to
watch
over
him
with
medicines
and
blankets
and
a
fan
she
would
have
followed
barefoot
and
bareheaded
and
yet
her
heart
breaking
with
the
crucial
yearning
to
mother
him
and
protect
him
this
was
all
that
she
could
for
him
this
small
stitching
at
the
flag
he
had
promised
to
follow
when
the
work
was
quite
finished
she
went
all
over
it
again
with
double
thread
not
facing
the
superstition
of
her
motive
which
was
to
safeguard
her
lover
the
bullet
that
was
destined
for
crailey
might
in
the
myriad
chances
strike
the
flag
first
and
be
deflected
though
never
so
slightly
by
one
of
these
last
stitches
and
crailey
heart
thus
missed
by
the
same
margin
it
was
at
this
juncture
when
the
weeping
of
women
was
plentiful
when
old
men
pulled
long
faces
and
the
very
urchins
of
the
street
observed
periods
of
gravity
and
even
silence
that
a
notion
entered
the
head
of
tanberry
young
janie
tanberry
to
the
effect
that
such
things
were
all
wrong
she
declared
energetically
that
this
was
no
decent
fashion
of
farewell
that
after
the
soldiers
went
away
there
would
be
time
enough
to
enact
the
girls
they
had
left
behind
them
and
that
until
then
the
town
should
be
made
enlivening
so
she
went
about
preaching
a
revival
of
cheerfulness
waving
her
jewelled
hand
merrily
from
the
carewe
carriage
to
the
volunteers
she
saw
upon
the
street
calling
out
to
them
with
laughter
and
inspiring
quip
everywhere
scolding
the
mourners
viciously
in
her
husky
voice
and
leaving
so
much
of
heartening
vivacity
in
her
wake
that
none
could
fail
to
be
convinced
that
she
was
a
wise
woman
nor
was
her
vigor
spent
in
vain
it
was
decided
that
a
ball
should
be
given
to
the
volunteers
of
rouen
two
nights
before
their
departure
for
the
state
rendezvous
and
it
should
be
made
the
noblest
festival
in
rouen
history
the
subscribers
took
their
oath
to
it
they
rented
the
big
at
the
rouen
house
covered
the
floor
with
smooth
cloth
and
hung
the
walls
solidly
with
banners
and
roses
for
june
had
come
more
they
ran
a
red
carpet
across
the
sidewalk
which
was
perfectly
dry
and
clean
almost
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
they
imported
two
extra
fiddles
and
a
clarionet
to
enlarge
the
orchestra
and
they
commanded
a
supper
such
as
a
hungry
man
beholds
in
a
dream
miss
betty
laid
out
her
prettiest
dress
that
evening
and
tanberry
came
in
and
worshipped
it
as
it
rested
like
foam
of
lavender
and
white
and
gray
upon
the
bed
beside
the
snowy
gloves
with
their
tiny
stiff
lace
gauntlets
while
two
small
white
with
jeweled
buckles
where
the
straps
crossed
each
other
were
being
fastened
upon
miss
betty
silken
feet
by
the
vain
and
gloating
mamie
it
a
wicked
cruelty
princess
exclaimed
tanberry
we
want
cheer
the
poor
fellows
and
help
them
to
be
gay
and
here
do
you
deliberately
plan
to
make
them
sick
at
the
thought
of
leaving
the
place
that
holds
you
or
have
you
discovered
that
there
one
poor
vagabond
of
the
band
getting
off
without
having
his
heart
broken
and
made
up
your
mind
to
do
it
for
him
tonight
is
father
to
go
with
us
asked
betty
it
was
through
tanberry
that
she
now
derived
all
information
concerning
carewe
as
he
had
not
directly
addressed
her
since
the
afternoon
when
he
discovered
her
reading
the
journal
extra
no
we
are
to
meet
him
there
he
seems
rather
pleasanter
than
usual
this
evening
remarked
tanberry
hopefully
as
she
retired
den
we
mus
git
ready
to
share
big
trouble
tomorrer
commented
the
kneeling
mamie
with
a
giggle
alas
poor
adoring
servitress
she
received
a
share
unto
herself
that
very
evening
for
her
young
mistress
usually
as
amiable
as
a
fair
summer
sky
fidgetted
grumbled
found
nothing
well
done
and
was
never
two
minutes
in
the
same
mind
after
donning
the
selected
dress
she
declared
it
a
fright
tried
two
others
abused
each
roundly
dismissed
her
almost
weeping
handmaiden
abruptly
and
again
put
on
the
first
sitting
down
to
the
mirror
she
spent
a
full
hour
over
the
arrangement
of
her
hair
looking
attentively
at
her
image
sometimes
with
the
beginning
of
doubtful
approval
often
angrily
and
now
and
then
beseechingly
imploring
it
to
be
lovely
when
tanberry
came
in
to
tell
her
that
nelson
was
at
the
block
with
the
carriage
miss
betty
did
not
turn
and
the
elder
lady
stopped
on
the
threshold
and
gave
a
quick
asthmatic
gasp
of
delight
for
the
picture
she
saw
was
without
a
doubt
in
the
world
what
she
proclaimed
it
a
moment
later
ravishingly
pretty
the
girlish
little
pink
and
white
room
with
all
its
dainty
settings
for
a
background
lit
by
the
dozen
candles
in
their
sconces
and
half
as
many
slender
silver
candlesticks
and
seated
before
the
twinkling
mirror
the
beautiful
miss
carewe
in
her
gown
of
lace
and
flounces
that
were
crisp
yet
soft
her
rope
of
pearls
her
white
sandals
and
all
the
glory
of
her
youth
she
had
wound
a
wreath
of
white
roses
into
her
hair
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
her
eyes
warm
and
glowing
yet
inscrutable
in
their
long
gaze
into
the
mirror
oh
said
tanberry
you
make
me
want
to
be
a
man
i
pick
you
up
and
run
to
the
north
pole
where
no
one
could
ever
follow
and
i
can
tell
you
that
it
hurts
not
to
throw
my
arms
round
you
and
kiss
you
but
you
so
exquisite
i
do
want
to
touch
you
in
answer
miss
betty
ran
to
her
and
kissed
her
rapturously
on
both
cheeks
am
i
after
all
she
cried
am
i
is
it
will
the
roses
do
and
without
heeding
her
companion
staccatoes
of
approval
she
went
rapidly
to
the
open
bureau
snatched
up
a
double
handful
of
ribbons
and
furbelows
and
dashed
out
of
the
room
in
search
of
the
disgraced
mamie
she
found
her
seated
on
the
kitchen
in
lonely
lamentation
and
showered
the
gifts
into
her
lap
while
the
vain
one
shrieked
inimitably
with
pride
in
the
sudden
vision
of
her
mistress
and
joy
of
the
incredible
possessions
here
and
here
and
here
said
miss
betty
in
a
breath
hurling
the
fineries
upon
her
i
an
shrew
mamie
and
these
to
make
up
for
the
pain
i
gave
you
but
just
to
show
that
i
like
to
if
i
knew
how
and
she
was
off
like
an
april
breeze
dance
wid
the
screamed
mamie
pursuing
uproariously
to
see
the
last
of
her
as
she
jumped
into
the
carriage
bow
to
de
wittriest
an
kiss
de
one
you
love
de
bes
that
will
be
you
said
miss
betty
to
tanberry
and
kissed
the
good
lady
again
chapter
xvi
those
endearing
young
charms
it
is
a
matter
not
of
notoriety
but
of
the
happiest
celebrity
that
tanberry
danced
that
night
and
not
only
that
she
danced
but
that
she
waltzed
to
the
lot
of
tappingham
marsh
whom
she
pronounced
the
most
wheedlmg
vagabond
next
to
crailey
gray
of
her
acquaintance
it
fell
to
persuade
her
and
after
a
quadrille
with
the
elder
chenoweth
she
was
with
tappingham
more
extraordinary
to
relate
she
danced
down
both
her
partner
and
music
thereupon
did
bareaud
stung
with
envy
dare
emulation
and
essay
a
schottische
with
miss
trixie
chenoweth
performing
marvelously
well
for
many
delectable
turns
before
he
unfortunately
fell
down
it
was
a
night
when
a
sculptured
god
would
have
danced
on
his
pedestal
june
but
not
balm
in
the
air
and
rose
leaves
on
the
breeze
and
even
minerva
great
heels
might
have
marked
the
time
that
orchestra
kept
be
sure
they
waltzed
again
to
those
endearing
young
charms
oh
the
heart
that
has
truly
loved
never
forgets
but
as
truly
loves
on
to
the
close
as
the
sunflower
turns
on
her
god
when
he
sets
the
same
look
that
she
gave
when
he
three
of
the
volunteers
were
resplendent
in
their
regimentals
marsh
who
had
been
elected
captain
of
the
new
company
to
succeed
vanrevel
and
will
cummings
and
jean
madrillon
the
lieutenants
this
glory
was
confined
to
the
officers
who
had
ordered
their
uniforms
at
home
for
the
privates
and
officers
were
to
receive
theirs
at
the
state
rendezvous
however
although
this
gala
adornment
was
limited
to
the
three
gentlemen
mentioned
their
appearance
added
an
indescribable
air
of
splendor
and
pathos
to
the
occasion
to
quote
cummings
once
more
a
fourth
citizen
of
the
town
who
might
have
seized
upon
this
opportunity
to
display
himself
as
a
soldier
neglected
to
take
advantage
of
it
and
stole
in
quietly
toward
the
last
in
his
ordinary
attire
leaving
his
major
uniform
folded
on
a
chair
in
his
own
room
the
flag
was
to
be
presented
to
the
volunteers
at
the
close
of
the
evening
and
tom
came
for
that
so
he
claimed
to
his
accusing
soul
he
entered
unobserved
and
made
his
way
keeping
close
to
the
wall
to
where
bareaud
sat
taking
a
chair
at
her
side
but
robert
carewe
glancing
thither
by
chance
saw
him
and
changed
countenance
for
an
instant
carewe
composed
his
features
swiftly
excused
himself
with
elaborate
courtesy
from
miss
chenoweth
with
whom
he
was
talking
and
crossed
the
room
to
a
corner
near
his
enemy
presently
as
the
music
ceased
the
volunteers
were
bidden
to
come
forward
whereupon
tom
left
bareaud
and
began
to
work
his
way
down
the
room
groups
were
forming
and
breaking
up
in
the
general
movement
of
the
crowd
and
the
dissolving
of
one
brought
him
face
to
face
with
elizabeth
carewe
who
was
moving
slowly
in
the
opposite
direction
a
small
flock
of
suitors
in
her
train
the
confrontation
came
so
suddenly
and
so
unexpectedly
that
before
either
was
aware
they
looked
squarely
into
each
other
eyes
full
and
straight
and
both
stopped
instantly
as
though
transfixed
miss
betty
leaving
a
sentence
forever
there
was
a
fierce
short
vocal
sound
from
the
crowd
behind
vanrevel
but
no
one
noticed
carewe
and
then
tom
bowed
gravely
as
in
apology
for
blocking
the
way
and
passed
on
miss
betty
began
to
talk
again
much
at
random
with
a
vivacity
too
greatly
exaggerated
to
be
genuine
while
the
high
color
went
from
her
cheeks
and
left
her
pale
nothing
could
have
enraged
her
more
with
herself
than
the
consciousness
now
suddenly
strong
within
her
that
the
encounter
had
a
perceptible
effect
upon
her
what
power
had
this
man
to
make
her
manner
strained
and
mechanical
what
right
had
his
eyes
always
to
stir
her
as
they
did
it
was
not
he
for
whom
she
had
spent
an
hour
over
her
hair
not
he
for
whom
she
had
driven
her
poor
handmaiden
away
in
tears
that
was
for
one
who
had
not
come
one
great
in
heart
and
goodness
one
of
a
pure
and
sacrificial
life
who
deserved
all
she
could
give
and
for
whose
sake
she
had
honored
herself
in
trying
to
look
as
pretty
as
she
could
he
had
not
come
and
that
hurt
her
a
little
but
she
felt
his
generosity
believing
that
his
motive
was
to
spare
her
since
she
could
not
speak
to
him
in
mr
carewe
presence
without
open
and
public
rupture
with
her
father
well
she
was
almost
ready
for
that
seeing
how
little
of
a
father
hers
was
ah
that
other
should
have
come
if
only
to
stand
between
her
and
this
tall
hypocrite
whose
dark
glance
had
such
strength
to
disturb
her
what
lies
that
gaze
contained
all
in
the
one
flash
the
strange
pretence
of
comprehending
her
gently
but
completely
a
sad
compassion
too
and
with
it
a
look
of
farewell
seeming
to
say
once
more
i
have
come
for
this
and
just
for
she
knew
that
he
was
going
with
the
others
going
perhaps
forever
only
the
day
after
tomorrow
she
would
see
him
no
more
and
be
free
of
him
let
the
day
after
tomorrow
come
soon
miss
betty
hated
herself
for
understanding
the
adieu
and
hated
herself
more
because
she
could
not
be
sure
that
in
the
startled
moment
of
meeting
before
she
collected
herself
she
had
let
it
go
unanswered
she
had
done
more
than
that
without
knowing
it
she
had
bent
her
head
to
his
bow
and
carewe
had
seen
both
the
salutation
and
the
look
the
young
men
were
gathered
near
the
orchestra
and
to
the
hilarious
strains
of
yankee
doodle
the
flag
they
were
to
receive
for
their
regiment
was
borne
down
the
room
by
the
sisters
and
sweethearts
who
had
made
it
all
of
whom
were
there
except
fanchon
bareaud
crailey
had
persuaded
her
to
surrender
the
flag
for
the
sake
of
spending
this
evening
next
to
his
last
in
rouen
at
home
alone
with
him
the
elder
chenoweth
made
the
speech
of
presentation
that
is
he
made
part
of
it
before
he
broke
down
for
his
son
stood
in
the
ranks
of
the
devoted
band
until
this
incident
occurred
all
had
gone
trippingly
for
everyone
had
tried
to
put
the
day
after
from
his
mind
perhaps
there
might
not
have
been
so
many
tears
even
now
if
the
young
men
had
not
stood
together
so
smilingly
to
receive
their
gift
it
was
seeing
them
so
gay
and
confident
so
strong
in
their
youth
and
so
unselfish
of
purpose
it
was
this
and
the
feeling
that
all
of
them
must
suffer
and
some
of
them
die
before
they
came
back
so
that
when
chenoweth
choking
in
his
loftiest
flight
came
to
a
full
stop
and
without
disguise
buried
his
face
in
his
handkerchief
tanberry
the
apostle
of
gayety
openly
sobbed
chenoweth
without
more
ado
carried
the
flag
over
to
tappingham
marsh
whom
vanrevel
directed
to
receive
it
and
tappingham
thanked
the
donors
without
many
words
because
there
were
not
then
many
at
his
command
miss
carewe
bad
been
chosen
to
sing
the
star
spangled
banner
and
she
stepped
out
a
little
from
the
crowd
to
face
the
young
men
as
the
orchestra
sounded
the
first
chord
she
sang
in
a
full
clear
voice
but
when
the
volunteers
saw
that
as
she
sang
the
tears
were
streaming
down
her
cheeks
in
spite
of
the
brave
voice
they
began
to
choke
with
the
others
if
miss
betty
found
them
worth
weeping
for
they
could
afford
to
cry
a
little
for
themselves
yet
they
joined
the
chorus
nobly
and
raised
the
roof
with
the
ringing
song
sending
the
flamboyant
proud
old
words
thunderously
to
heaven
that
was
not
the
last
song
of
the
night
general
trumble
and
chenoweth
had
invited
their
young
friends
to
attend
after
the
ball
a
collation
which
they
chose
to
call
a
supper
but
which
to
accord
with
the
hour
might
more
aptly
have
been
designated
a
breakfast
to
afford
a
private
retreat
for
the
scene
of
this
celebration
they
had
borrowed
the
offices
of
gray
and
vanrevel
and
crailey
hospitably
announced
that
any
guest
was
welcome
to
stay
for
a
year
or
two
since
probably
neither
of
the
firm
would
have
need
of
an
office
for
at
least
that
length
of
time
nine
men
gathered
about
the
table
which
replaced
tom
old
desk
the
two
chenoweths
eugene
madrillon
marsh
jefferson
bareaud
the
stout
general
tom
vanrevel
crailey
and
will
cummings
the
editor
coming
in
a
little
late
but
rubbing
his
hands
cheerfully
over
what
he
declared
was
to
be
the
last
column
from
his
pen
to
rear
its
length
on
the
journal
front
page
for
many
a
long
day
a
description
of
the
presentation
of
the
flag
a
bit
of
prose
which
he
considered
almost
equal
to
his
report
of
the
warehouse
fire
this
convivial
party
made
merry
and
tried
to
forget
that
most
of
them
had
been
mighty
teary
as
marsh
said
an
hour
earlier
while
chenoweth
sat
with
his
hand
on
his
son
shoulder
unconsciously
most
of
the
time
apologetically
removing
it
when
he
observed
it
many
were
the
witticisms
concerning
the
difference
in
rank
hence
forth
to
be
observed
between
the
young
men
as
tom
was
now
a
major
marsh
a
captain
will
cummings
a
second
lieutenant
and
the
rest
mere
privates
except
crailey
who
was
a
corporal
nevertheless
though
the
board
was
festive
it
was
somewhat
subdued
and
absent
until
they
came
to
the
toasts
it
was
tappingham
who
proposed
miss
betty
carewe
i
know
tom
vanrevel
will
understand
nay
i
know
he
man
enough
to
join
us
said
marsh
as
he
rose
why
should
i
say
that
we
may
hail
ourselves
as
patriots
indeed
since
at
the
call
of
our
country
we
depart
from
the
town
which
is
this
lady
home
and
at
the
trumpet
sound
resign
the
gracious
blessing
of
seeing
her
day
by
day
and
why
should
we
admit
loyally
and
openly
that
it
is
her
image
alone
which
shines
in
the
hearts
of
most
of
us
here
and
no
man
arose
to
contradict
that
speech
which
appears
to
have
rung
true
seeing
that
four
of
those
present
had
proposed
to
her
again
that
same
evening
so
i
give
you
cried
tappingham
gallantly
the
health
of
miss
betty
carewe
the
loveliest
rose
of
our
bouquet
may
she
remember
us
when
we
come
home
they
rose
and
drank
it
with
a
shout
but
tom
vanrevel
not
setting
down
his
cup
went
to
the
window
and
threw
wide
the
shutters
letting
in
a
ruddy
shaft
of
the
morning
sun
so
that
as
he
stood
in
the
strong
glow
he
looked
like
a
man
carved
out
of
red
gold
he
lifted
his
glass
not
toward
the
table
and
his
companions
while
they
stared
at
him
surprised
but
toward
the
locusts
of
carewe
street
to
miss
betty
carewe
he
said
the
finest
flower
of
them
all
may
she
remember
those
who
never
come
home
and
without
pausing
he
lifted
his
rich
baritone
in
an
old
song
that
had
been
vastly
popular
with
the
young
men
of
rouen
ever
since
the
night
of
miss
betty
debut
they
had
hummed
it
as
they
went
about
their
daily
work
they
had
whistled
it
on
the
streets
they
had
drifted
into
dreams
at
night
with
the
sound
of
it
still
chiming
in
their
ears
and
now
with
one
accord
as
they
stood
gathered
together
for
the
last
time
in
rouen
they
joined
tom
vanrevel
and
sang
it
again
and
the
eyes
of
crailey
gray
rested
very
gently
upon
his
best
friend
as
they
sang
believe
me
if
all
those
endearing
young
charms
which
i
gaze
on
so
fondly
were
to
change
by
and
fleet
from
my
arms
like
fairy
gifts
fading
away
thou
wouldst
still
be
adored
as
this
moment
thou
art
let
thy
loveliness
fade
as
it
will
and
around
the
dear
ruin
each
wish
of
my
heart
would
entwine
itself
verdantly
chapter
xvii
the
price
of
silence
it
was
the
misfortune
of
cummings
first
literary
offering
to
annoy
one
of
the
editor
friends
the
journal
was
brought
to
the
corporal
at
noon
while
he
was
considering
whether
he
should
rise
from
his
couch
or
sleep
another
hour
reclining
among
his
pillows
he
glanced
through
cummings
description
with
the
subdued
giggle
he
always
had
for
the
good
william
style
but
as
his
eye
fell
upon
one
paragraph
he
started
sat
upright
and
proceeded
to
read
the
passage
several
times
with
anxious
attention
only
two
or
three
sources
of
regret
occurred
to
mar
the
delight
in
which
young
and
old
participated
of
that
festal
and
dazzling
scene
one
was
the
absence
of
miss
fanchon
bareaud
one
the
donors
another
that
of
corporal
gray
a
third
was
the
excessive
modesty
of
major
vanrevel
although
present
at
the
time
refused
to
receive
the
ladies
sumptuous
offering
and
insisted
that
captain
marsh
was
the
proper
person
to
do
the
honors
to
which
the
latter
reluctantly
though
gracefully
consented
also
we
were
sorry
that
the
major
appeared
in
citizen
dress
as
all
were
anxious
to
witness
him
in
his
uniform
however
in
our
humble
judgment
he
will
be
compelled
by
etiquette
to
don
it
this
afternoon
to
receive
the
officers
of
the
regular
army
who
will
arrive
by
the
stage
about
five
it
is
expected
to
inspect
the
company
and
swear
them
into
the
service
of
the
federal
government
at
the
court
house
we
for
one
have
little
doubt
that
owing
to
the
major
talent
in
matters
of
apparel
his
appearance
will
far
eclipse
in
brilliancy
that
of
his
crailey
dressed
slowly
returning
to
the
paper
now
and
then
with
a
perturbed
countenance
how
would
miss
betty
explain
this
paragraph
to
herself
and
how
account
for
the
fact
that
she
had
not
seen
crailey
how
for
the
fact
that
she
had
seen
tom
it
seemed
unlikely
that
she
could
have
overlooked
the
latter
tom
was
one
of
those
whom
everybody
saw
wherever
he
went
and
what
inquiries
would
she
make
for
crailey
had
no
means
of
knowing
that
she
would
not
see
the
journal
tomorrow
he
would
be
gone
it
would
be
all
over
but
he
wanted
this
last
day
to
run
smoothly
what
wild
hopes
he
had
of
things
that
should
happen
when
they
all
came
marching
home
no
one
can
say
even
if
it
were
not
to
be
doubted
that
crailey
ever
entertained
hopes
of
any
kind
whatever
since
to
hope
is
to
bestow
thought
upon
the
future
but
however
affairs
ran
with
him
so
far
as
hope
was
concerned
he
seldom
lacked
an
idea
and
one
came
to
him
presently
a
notion
that
put
the
frown
to
rout
and
brought
the
old
smile
to
his
lips
his
smile
of
the
and
tolerant
prelate
he
flicked
the
paper
lightly
from
him
and
it
sped
across
the
room
like
a
big
bird
in
awkward
flight
for
he
knew
how
to
preserve
his
last
day
as
he
wished
and
to
make
all
smooth
he
finished
his
toilet
with
particular
care
took
a
flower
from
a
vase
on
his
table
placed
it
in
his
coat
and
went
down
to
the
dusty
street
where
everything
was
warm
and
bright
with
summer
it
was
joy
to
be
alive
there
was
wine
enough
in
the
air
and
crailey
made
up
his
mind
not
to
take
a
drink
that
day
the
last
day
the
last
day
the
three
words
kept
ringing
through
his
head
like
a
minor
phrase
from
a
song
tomorrow
at
noon
they
would
be
churning
down
the
river
and
this
was
the
last
day
the
last
day
still
not
too
late
to
make
another
friend
at
home
he
said
stopping
to
pat
the
head
of
a
mangy
street
cur
that
came
crouching
and
wobbling
toward
him
like
a
staveless
little
keg
worried
by
scurries
of
wind
dogs
and
children
always
fell
in
love
with
crailey
at
first
sight
and
he
never
failed
to
receive
them
in
the
spirit
of
their
approach
now
the
mongrel
at
his
touch
immediately
turned
himself
over
and
lay
upon
the
pavement
with
all
paws
in
air
to
say
great
lord
magnificent
in
the
graciousness
which
deigns
to
cast
a
glimpse
upon
this
abject
cluster
of
ribs
i
perceive
that
your
heart
is
too
gentle
to
kick
me
in
my
present
helplessness
yet
do
with
me
as
you
i
doubt
if
you
breakfasted
brother
crailey
responded
aloud
rubbing
the
dog
head
softly
with
the
tip
of
his
boot
will
you
share
the
meagre
fare
of
one
who
is
a
poet
should
be
a
lawyer
but
is
about
to
become
a
soldier
eh
but
a
corporal
rise
my
friend
up
and
be
in
your
own
small
self
a
whole
corporal
guard
and
if
your
corporal
does
come
home
from
the
wars
perhaps
you
remember
him
kindly
think
he
made
a
vivacious
gesture
the
small
animal
sprang
into
the
air
convoluted
with
gratitude
and
new
love
while
crailey
laughing
softly
led
the
way
to
the
hotel
there
while
he
ate
sparsely
himself
he
provided
munificently
for
his
new
acquaintance
and
recommended
him
with
an
accompaniment
of
silver
to
the
good
offices
of
the
rouen
house
kitchen
after
that
out
into
the
sunshine
again
he
went
with
elastic
step
and
a
merry
word
and
a
laugh
for
everyone
he
met
at
the
old
english
gardener
he
bought
four
or
five
bouquets
and
carried
them
on
a
round
of
visits
of
farewell
to
as
many
old
ladies
who
had
been
kind
to
him
this
done
leaving
his
laughter
and
his
flowers
behind
him
he
went
to
fanchon
and
spent
part
of
the
afternoon
bringing
forth
cunning
arguments
cheerily
to
prove
to
her
that
general
taylor
would
be
in
the
mexican
capital
before
the
volunteers
reached
new
orleans
and
urging
upon
her
his
belief
that
they
would
all
be
back
in
rouen
before
the
summer
was
gone
but
fanchon
could
only
sob
and
whisper
hush
hush
in
the
dim
room
where
they
sat
the
windows
darkened
so
that
after
he
had
gone
he
should
not
remember
how
red
her
eyes
were
and
the
purple
depths
under
them
and
thus
forget
how
pretty
she
had
been
at
her
best
after
a
time
finding
that
the
more
he
tried
to
cheer
her
the
more
brokenly
she
wept
he
grew
silent
only
stroking
her
head
while
the
summer
sounds
came
in
through
the
window
the
of
locusts
the
small
monotone
of
distant
the
laughter
of
children
in
the
street
and
the
gay
arias
of
a
singing
in
the
open
window
of
the
next
house
so
they
sat
together
through
the
long
still
afternoon
of
the
last
day
no
one
in
rouen
found
that
afternoon
particularly
enlivening
even
tanberry
gave
way
to
the
common
depression
and
once
more
her
doctrine
of
cheerfulness
relegated
to
the
ghostly
ranks
of
the
purely
theoretical
she
bowed
under
the
burden
of
her
woe
so
far
as
to
sing
methought
i
met
a
damsel
fair
her
of
the
bursting
sighs
at
the
piano
whenever
sadness
lay
upon
her
soul
she
had
acquired
the
habit
of
resorting
to
this
unhappy
ballad
today
she
sang
it
four
times
carewe
was
not
at
home
and
had
announced
that
though
he
intended
to
honor
the
evening
meal
by
his
attendance
he
should
be
away
for
the
evening
itself
as
comment
upon
which
statement
tanberry
had
offered
ambiguously
the
one
word
amen
he
was
stung
to
no
reply
and
she
had
noted
the
circumstance
as
unusual
and
also
that
he
had
appeared
to
labor
with
the
suppression
of
a
keen
excitement
which
made
him
anxious
to
escape
from
her
sharp
little
eyes
an
agitation
for
which
she
easily
accounted
when
she
recalled
that
he
had
seen
vanrevel
on
the
previous
evening
carewe
had
kept
his
promise
to
preserve
the
peace
as
he
always
kept
it
when
the
two
met
on
neutral
ground
but
she
had
observed
that
his
face
showed
a
kind
of
violence
whenever
he
had
been
forced
to
breathe
the
air
of
the
same
room
with
his
enemy
and
that
the
thing
grew
on
him
miss
betty
exhibited
not
precisely
a
burning
interest
in
the
adventure
of
the
damsel
fair
wandering
out
of
the
room
during
the
second
rendition
wandering
back
again
and
once
more
away
she
had
moved
about
the
house
in
this
fashion
since
early
morning
wearing
what
mamie
described
as
a
and
restless
with
distressed
eyes
to
which
no
sleep
had
come
in
the
night
she
could
not
read
she
could
no
more
than
touch
her
harp
she
could
not
sleep
she
could
not
remain
quiet
for
three
minutes
together
often
she
sank
into
a
chair
with
an
air
of
languor
and
weariness
only
to
start
immediately
out
of
it
and
seek
some
other
part
of
the
house
or
to
go
and
pace
the
garden
here
in
the
air
heavy
with
roses
and
tremulous
with
june
as
she
walked
rapidly
up
and
down
late
in
the
afternoon
at
the
time
when
the
faraway
were
calling
men
from
the
fields
to
supper
the
climax
of
her
restlessness
came
that
anguish
and
desperation
so
old
in
her
sex
the
rebellion
against
the
law
that
inaction
must
be
her
part
had
fallen
upon
her
for
the
first
time
she
came
to
an
abrupt
stop
and
struck
her
hands
together
despairingly
and
spoke
aloud
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
asked
a
surprised
voice
just
behind
her
she
wheeled
quickly
about
to
behold
a
urchin
of
ten
in
the
path
near
the
little
clearing
he
was
ragged
tanned
dusty
neither
shoes
nor
coat
trammelling
his
independence
and
he
had
evidently
entered
the
garden
through
the
gap
in
the
hedge
i
thought
you
spoke
to
me
he
said
inquiringly
i
did
see
you
she
returned
what
is
it
you
miss
carewe
he
asked
but
before
she
could
answer
he
said
reassuringly
why
of
course
you
are
i
remember
you
perfect
now
i
git
the
light
on
you
so
to
speak
do
you
remember
me
no
i
do
think
i
lord
he
responded
wonderingly
i
was
one
of
the
boys
with
you
on
them
boxes
the
night
of
your
pa
fire
mingled
with
the
surprise
in
his
tone
was
a
respectful
unction
which
intimated
how
greatly
he
honored
her
father
for
having
been
the
owner
of
so
satisfactory
a
conflagration
were
you
perhaps
i
remember
you
if
you
give
me
but
at
this
point
the
youth
recalled
the
fact
that
he
had
an
errand
to
discharge
and
assuming
an
expression
of
businesslike
haste
too
pressing
to
permit
farther
parley
sought
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
sealed
envelope
with
which
he
advanced
upon
her
here
there
an
answer
he
told
me
not
to
tell
nobody
who
sent
it
and
not
to
give
it
to
nobody
on
earth
but
you
and
how
to
slip
in
through
the
hedge
and
try
and
find
you
in
the
garden
when
nobody
was
lookin
and
he
give
a
pencil
for
you
to
answer
on
the
back
of
it
and
a
miss
betty
took
the
note
glancing
once
over
her
shoulder
at
the
house
but
tanberry
was
still
occupied
with
the
maiden
and
no
one
was
in
sight
she
read
the
message
hastily
i
have
obeyed
you
and
shall
always
you
have
not
sent
for
me
perhaps
that
was
because
there
was
no
time
when
you
thought
it
safe
perhaps
you
have
still
felt
there
would
be
a
loss
of
dignity
does
that
weigh
with
you
against
tell
me
if
you
can
that
you
have
it
in
your
heart
to
let
me
go
without
seeing
you
once
more
without
for
the
last
time
or
was
it
untrue
that
you
wrote
me
what
you
did
was
that
dear
letter
but
a
little
fairy
dream
of
mine
ah
will
you
see
me
again
this
once
this
once
let
me
look
at
you
let
me
talk
with
you
hear
your
voice
the
last
time
there
was
no
signature
miss
betty
quickly
wrote
four
lines
upon
the
same
sheet
yes
yes
i
must
see
you
must
talk
with
you
before
you
go
come
at
dusk
the
garden
near
the
gap
in
the
hedge
it
will
be
safe
for
a
little
while
he
will
not
be
she
replaced
the
paper
in
its
envelope
drew
a
line
through
her
own
name
on
the
letter
and
wrote
mr
vanrevel
underneath
do
you
know
the
gentleman
who
sent
you
she
asked
no
but
he
be
waitin
at
his
office
and
vanrevel
on
main
street
for
the
then
hurry
said
betty
he
needed
no
second
bidding
but
with
wings
on
his
bare
heels
made
off
through
the
gap
in
the
hedge
at
the
corner
of
the
street
he
encountered
an
adventure
a
gentleman
legs
and
a
heavy
hand
at
the
same
time
the
hand
fell
on
his
shoulder
arresting
his
scamper
with
a
vicious
jerk
and
the
boy
was
too
awed
to
attempt
an
escape
for
he
knew
his
captor
well
by
sight
although
never
before
had
he
found
himself
so
directly
in
the
company
of
rouen
richest
citizen
the
note
dropped
from
the
small
trembling
fingers
yet
those
fingers
did
not
shake
as
did
the
when
like
a
flash
carewe
seized
upon
the
missive
with
his
disengaged
hand
and
saw
what
two
names
were
on
the
envelope
you
were
stealing
were
you
he
cried
savagely
i
saw
you
sneak
through
my
hedge
i
did
either
carewe
ground
his
teeth
what
were
you
doing
there
nothing
nothing
mocked
carewe
nothing
you
did
carry
this
to
the
young
lady
in
there
and
get
her
answer
no
sir
answered
the
captive
earnestly
cross
my
heart
i
did
i
found
it
slowly
the
corrugations
of
anger
were
levelled
from
the
magnate
face
the
white
heat
cooled
and
the
prisoner
marvelled
to
find
himself
in
the
presence
of
an
urbane
gentleman
whose
placidity
made
the
scene
of
a
moment
ago
appear
some
trick
of
distorted
vision
and
yet
curious
to
behold
carewe
fingers
shook
even
more
violently
than
before
as
he
released
the
boy
shoulder
and
gave
him
a
friendly
tap
on
the
head
at
the
same
time
smiling
benevolently
there
there
he
said
bestowing
a
wink
upon
the
youngster
it
all
right
it
does
matter
only
i
think
i
see
the
chance
of
a
jest
in
this
you
wait
while
i
read
this
little
note
this
message
that
you
found
he
ended
by
winking
again
with
the
friendliest
drollery
he
turned
his
back
to
the
boy
and
opened
the
note
continuing
to
stand
in
that
position
while
he
read
the
two
messages
it
struck
the
messenger
that
after
this
there
need
be
no
great
shame
in
his
own
lack
of
this
art
of
reading
since
it
took
so
famous
a
man
as
carewe
such
length
of
time
to
peruse
a
little
note
but
perhaps
the
great
gentleman
was
ill
for
it
appeared
to
the
boy
that
he
lurched
several
times
once
so
far
that
he
would
have
gone
over
if
he
had
not
saved
himself
by
a
lucky
stagger
and
once
except
for
the
fact
that
the
face
that
had
turned
away
had
worn
an
expression
of
such
genial
humor
the
boy
would
have
believed
that
from
it
issued
a
sound
like
the
gnashing
of
teeth
but
when
it
was
turned
to
him
again
it
bore
the
same
amiable
jocosity
of
mouth
and
eye
and
nothing
seemed
to
be
the
matter
except
that
those
fingers
still
shook
so
wildly
too
wildly
indeed
to
restore
the
note
to
its
envelope
there
said
carewe
put
it
back
laddie
put
it
back
yourself
take
it
to
the
gentleman
who
sent
you
i
see
he
even
disguised
his
hand
a
ha
and
i
suppose
he
may
not
have
expected
the
young
lady
to
write
his
name
quite
so
boldly
on
the
envelope
what
do
you
suppose
i
returned
the
boy
i
reckon
i
do
hardly
no
of
course
not
said
carewe
laughing
rather
madly
ha
ha
ha
of
course
you
would
and
how
much
did
he
give
you
yay
cried
the
other
joyously
did
he
go
and
hand
me
a
dollar
how
much
will
you
take
not
to
tell
him
that
i
stopped
you
and
read
it
how
much
not
to
speak
of
me
at
all
what
it
a
foolish
kind
of
joke
nothing
more
i
give
you
five
dollars
never
to
tell
anyone
that
you
saw
me
do
shoot
colonel
exclaimed
the
youth
with
a
riotous
fling
of
bare
feet
in
the
air
i
come
down
you
do
it
five
he
shouted
dancing
upon
the
boards
five
i
cross
my
heart
to
die
i
never
hear
tell
of
you
or
ever
knew
they
was
sich
a
man
in
the
world
carewe
bent
over
him
no
say
strike
me
dead
and
condemn
me
eternally
to
the
everlasting
flames
of
hell
if
i
ever
tell
this
entailed
quick
sobriety
though
only
benevolence
was
in
the
face
above
him
the
stopped
and
the
boy
pondered
frightened
have
i
got
to
say
that
carewe
produced
a
about
which
the
boy
beheld
a
halo
clearly
this
was
his
day
heaven
showed
its
approval
of
his
conduct
by
an
outpouring
of
imperishable
riches
and
yet
the
oath
misliked
him
there
was
a
savor
of
the
demoniacal
contract
still
that
was
to
be
borne
and
the
plunge
taken
for
there
fluttered
the
huge
sum
before
his
dazzled
eyes
he
took
a
deep
breath
strike
me
dead
he
began
slowly
if
i
ever
no
condemn
me
to
the
everlasting
flames
of
hell
have
i
got
to
condemn
me
to
to
the
everlasting
flames
of
of
hell
if
i
ever
tell
he
ran
off
pale
with
the
fear
that
he
might
grow
up
take
to
drink
and
some
day
tell
in
his
cups
but
so
resolved
not
to
coquet
with
temptation
that
he
went
round
a
block
to
avoid
the
door
of
the
rouen
house
bar
nevertheless
the
note
was
in
his
hand
and
the
fortune
in
his
pocket
and
carewe
was
safe
he
knew
that
the
boy
would
never
tell
and
he
knew
another
thing
for
he
had
read
the
journal
though
it
came
no
more
to
his
house
he
knew
that
tom
vanrevel
wore
his
uniform
that
evening
and
that
even
in
the
dusk
the
brass
buttons
on
an
officer
breast
make
a
good
mark
for
a
gun
steadied
along
the
ledge
of
a
window
as
he
entered
the
gates
and
went
toward
the
house
he
glanced
up
at
the
window
which
overlooked
his
garden
from
the
cupola
chapter
xviii
the
uniform
crailey
was
not
the
only
man
in
rouen
who
had
been
saying
to
himself
all
day
that
each
accustomed
thing
he
did
was
done
for
the
last
time
many
of
his
comrades
went
about
with
farewell
old
friend
in
their
hearts
not
only
for
the
people
but
for
the
usual
things
of
life
and
the
actions
of
habit
now
become
unexpectedly
dear
and
sweet
to
know
or
to
perform
so
tom
vanrevel
relieved
of
his
hot
uniform
loose
as
to
collar
wearing
a
big
and
stretched
in
a
chair
watched
the
sunset
from
the
western
window
of
the
dusty
office
where
he
had
dreamed
through
many
in
summers
past
and
now
took
his
leave
of
this
old
habit
of
his
in
silence
with
a
long
cigar
considering
the
chances
largely
against
his
ever
seeing
the
sun
go
down
behind
the
long
wooden
bridge
at
the
foot
of
main
street
again
the
ruins
of
the
warehouses
had
been
removed
and
the
river
was
laid
clear
to
his
sight
it
ran
between
brown
banks
like
a
river
of
rubies
and
at
the
wharf
the
small
evening
steamboat
ugly
and
grim
enough
to
behold
from
near
by
lay
pink
and
lovely
in
that
broad
glow
tooting
imminent
departure
although
an
hour
might
elapse
before
it
would
back
into
the
current
the
sun
widened
clung
briefly
to
the
horizon
and
dropped
behind
the
low
hills
beyond
the
bottom
lands
the
stream
grew
purple
then
took
on
a
lustre
of
pearl
as
the
stars
came
out
while
rosy
distances
changed
to
misty
blue
the
chatter
of
the
birds
in
the
main
street
maples
became
quieter
and
through
lessening
little
choruses
of
twittering
fell
gradually
to
silence
and
now
the
blue
dusk
crept
on
the
town
and
the
corner
threw
mottled
colors
on
the
pavement
from
the
hall
outside
the
closed
came
the
sound
of
quick
light
footsteps
it
was
crailey
going
out
but
tom
only
sighed
to
himself
and
did
not
hail
him
so
these
light
footsteps
of
crailey
gray
echoed
but
a
moment
in
the
stairway
and
were
heard
no
more
a
few
moments
later
a
tall
figure
dressed
from
neck
to
heels
in
a
gray
cloak
crossed
the
mottled
lights
and
disappeared
into
carewe
street
this
cloaked
person
wore
on
his
head
a
soldier
cap
and
tom
not
recognizing
him
surely
vaguely
wondered
why
tappingham
marsh
chose
to
muffle
himself
so
warmly
on
a
evening
he
noted
the
quick
alert
tread
as
like
marsh
usual
gait
but
no
suspicion
crossed
his
mind
that
the
figure
might
be
that
of
partner
a
rocket
went
up
from
the
rouen
house
then
another
followed
by
a
salvo
of
anvils
and
rackety
discharge
of
the
beginning
a
noble
display
of
fireworks
in
celebration
of
prospective
victories
of
the
united
states
and
utter
discomfiture
of
the
mexicans
when
the
rouen
volunteers
should
reach
the
seat
of
war
an
exhibition
of
patriotism
which
brought
little
pleasure
to
vanrevel
but
over
the
noise
of
the
street
he
heard
his
own
name
shouted
from
the
stairway
and
almost
instantly
a
violent
knocking
assailed
the
door
he
could
bid
the
visitor
enter
the
door
was
flung
open
by
a
stout
and
excited
colored
woman
who
at
sight
of
him
threw
up
her
hands
in
tremulous
thanksgiving
it
was
the
vain

she
sank
into
a

rocked
herself

smiled
upon

sadly
i
dare
say
there
a
simpler
explanation
do
you
suppose
that
if
nelson
was
right
and
carewe
really
did
come
back
it
was
because
he
did
not
wish
his
daughter
and
tanberry
to
know
that
that
he
expected
a
party
of

possibly
to

dis
night
i
had
not
dreamed
of
coming
tell
her
please
probably
i
shall
not
go
out
at
all
this
evening
but
it
was
kind
of
you
to
come
he
stood
with
a
candle
to
light
her
down
the
stairs
but
after
she
had
gone
he
did
not
return
to
the
office
instead
he
went
slowly
up
to
his
own
room
glancing
first
into
crailey
the
doors
of
neither
were
often
locked
to
behold
a
chaos
of
disorder
and
unfinished
packing
in
his
own
chamber
it
only
remained
for
him
to
close
the
lids
of
a
few
big
boxes
and
to
pack
a
small
trunk
which
he
meant
to
take
with
him
to
the
camp
of
the
state
troops
and
he
would
be
ready
for
departure
he
set
about
this
task
and
concluding
that
there
was
no
necessity
to
wear
his
uniform
on
the
steamboat
decided
to
place
it
in
the
trunk
and
went
to
the
bed
where
he
had
folded
and
left
it
it
was
not
there
nor
did
a
thorough
search
reveal
it
anywhere
in
the
room
yet
no
one
could
have
stolen
it
for
when
he
had
gone
down
to
the
office
crailey
had
remained
on
this
floor
mamie
had
come
within
a
few
minutes
after
crailey
went
out
and
during
his
conversation
with
her
the
had
been
open
no
one
could
have
passed
without
being
seen
also
a
thief
would
have
taken
other
things
as
well
as
the
uniform
and
surely
crailey
must
have
heard
crailey
would
crailey
then
tom
remembered
the
figure
in
the
long
cloak
and
the
military
cap
and
with
a
sick
heart
began
to
understand
he
had
read
the
journal
and
he
knew
why
crailey
might
wish
to
masquerade
in
a
major
uniform
that
night
if
miss
carewe
read
it
too
and
a
strange
wonder
rose
in
her
mind
this
and
a
word
would
convince
her
tom
considered
it
improbable
that
the
wonder
would
rise
for
circumstances
had
too
well
established
her
in
a
mistake
trivial
and
ordinary
enough
at
first
merely
the
confusing
of
two
names
by
a
girl
new
to
the
town
but
so
strengthened
by
every
confirmation
crailey
wit
could
compass
that
she
would
no
doubt
only
set
cummings
paragraph
aside
as
a
newspaper
error
still
crailey
had
wished
to
be
on
the
safe
side
tom
sighed
rather
bitterly
he
was
convinced
that
the
harlequin
would
come
home
soon
replace
the
uniform
which
was
probably
extremely
becoming
to
him
as
they
were
of
a
height
and
figure
much
the
same
and
afterward
in
his
ordinary
dress
would
sally
forth
to
spend
his
last
evening
with
fanchon
tom
wondered
how
crailey
would
feel
and
what
he
would
think
about
himself
while
he
was
changing
his
clothes
but
he
remembered
his
partner
extraordinary
powers
of
mental
adjustment
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
vanrevel
made
no
allowance
for
the
other
temperament
and
there
came
to
him
a
moment
when
he
felt
that
he
could
almost
dislike
crailey
gray
at
all
events
he
would
go
out
until
crailey
had
come
and
left
again
for
he
had
no
desire
to
behold
the
masquerader
return
so
he
exchanged
his
for
a
coat
fastened
his
collar
and
had
begun
to
arrange
his
cravat
at
the
mirror
when
suddenly
the
voice
of
the
old
negress
seemed
to
sound
close
beside
him
in
the
room
he
settin
dah
waitin
the
cravat
was
never
tied
tom
hands
dropped
to
his
sides
as
he
started
back
from
the
staring
face
in
the
mirror
robert
carewe
was
waiting
and
crailey
all
at
once
there
was
but
one
vital
necessity
in
the
world
for
tom
vanrevel
that
was
to
find
crailey
he
must
go
to
crailey
even
in
carewe
own
house
he
must
go
to
crailey
he
dashed
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
street
the
people
were
making
a
great
uproar
in
front
of
the
hotel
exploding
bombs
firing
muskets
in
the
air
sending
up
rockets
and
rapidly
crossing
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
he
passed
into
carewe
street
unnoticed
here
the
detonations
were
not
so
deafening
though
the
little
steamboat
at
the
wharf
was
contributing
to
the
confusion
with
all
in
her
power
screeching
simultaneously
approval
of
the
celebration
and
her
last
signals
of
departure
at
the
first
corner
tom
had
no
more
than
left
the
sidewalk
when
he
came
within
a
foot
of
being
ridden
down
by
two
horsemen
who
rode
at
so
desperate
a
gallop
that
the
sound
of
their
being
lost
in
the
uproar
from
main
street
they
were
upon
him
before
he
was
aware
of
them
he
leaped
back
with
an
angry
shout
to
know
who
they
were
that
they
rode
so
wildly
at
the
same
time
a
sharp
explosion
at
the
foot
of
the
street
sent
a
red
flare
over
the
scene
a
flash
gone
with
such
incredible
swiftness
into
renewed
darkness
that
he
saw
the
flying
horsemen
almost
as
equestrian
statues
illumined
by
a
flicker
of
lightning
but
he
saw
them
with
the
same
distinctness
that
lightning
gives
and
recognized
the
foremost
as
robert
carewe
and
in
the
instant
of
that
recognition
tom
knew
what
had
happened
to
crailey
gray
for
he
saw
the
truth
in
the
ghastly
face
of
his
enemy
carewe
rode
stiffly
like
a
man
frozen
upon
his
horse
and
his
face
was
like
that
of
a
frozen
man
his
eyes
glassy
and
not
fixed
upon
his
course
so
that
it
was
a
deathly
thing
to
see
once
long
ago
tom
had
seen
a
man
riding
for
his
life
and
he
wore
this
same
look
the
animal
bounded
and
swerved
under
vanrevel
enemy
in
the
mad
rush
down
the
street
but
he
sat
rigid
bolt
upright
in
the
saddle
his
face
set
to
that
look
of
coldness
the
second
rider
was
old
nelson
who
rode
with
body
crouched
forward
his
eyeballs
like
shining
porcelain
set
in
ebony
and
his
arm
like
a
flail
cruelly
lashing
his
own
horse
and
his
master
with
a
heavy
whip
de
steamboat
he
shouted
hoarsely
bringing
down
the
lash
on
one
and
then
on
the
other
de
steamboat
de
steamboat
f
o
god
sake
honey
de
steamboat
they
swept
into
main
street
nelson
leaning
far
across
to
the
bridle
and
turning
both
horses
toward
the
river
but
before
they
had
made
the
corner
tom
vanrevel
was
running
with
all
the
speed
that
was
in
him
toward
his
enemy
house
the
one
block
between
him
and
that
forbidden
ground
seemed
to
him
miles
long
and
he
felt
that
he
was
running
as
a
man
in
a
dream
and
at
the
highest
pitch
of
agonized
exertion
covering
no
space
but
only
working
the
air
in
one
place
like
a
treadmill
all
that
was
in
his
mind
heart
and
soul
was
to
reach
crailey
he
had
known
by
the
revelation
of
carewe
face
in
what
case
he
would
find
his
friend
but
as
he
ran
he
put
the
knowledge
from
him
with
a
great
shudder
and
resolved
upon
incredulity
in
spite
of
his
certainty
all
he
let
himself
feel
was
the
need
to
run
to
run
until
he
found
crailey
who
was
somewhere
in
the
darkness
of
the
trees
about
the
long
low
house
on
the
corner
when
he
reached
the
bordering
hedge
he
did
not
stay
for
gate
or
path
but
with
a
loud
shout
hurled
himself
half
over
half
through
the
hedge
like
a
bolt
from
a
catapult
lights
shone
from
only
one
room
in
the
house
the
library
but
as
he
ran
toward
the
porch
a
candle
flickered
in
the
hall
and
there
came
the
sound
of
a
voice
weeping
with
terror
at
that
he
called
more
desperately
upon
his
incredulity
to
aid
him
for
the
voice
was
if
it
had
been
any
other
than
she
who
sobbed
so
hopelessly
she
who
was
always
steady
and
strong
if
he
could
he
would
have
stopped
to
pray
now
before
he
faced
her
and
the
truth
but
his
flying
feet
carried
him
on
who
is
it
she
gasped
brokenly
from
the
hall
mamie
have
you
brought
him
it
i
he
cried
as
he
plunged
through
the
doorway
it
tanberry
set
the
iron
candlestick
down
upon
the
table
with
a
crash
you
come
too
late
she
sobbed
another
man
has
taken
your
death
on
he
reeled
back
against
the
wall
oh
god
he
said
oh
god
god
god
crailey
yes
she
answered
it
the
poor
vagabond
that
you
loved
so
together
they
ran
through
the
hall
to
the
library
crailey
was
lying
on
the
long
sofa
his
eyes
closed
his
head
like
a
piece
of
carven
marble
the
gay
uniform
in
which
he
had
tricked
himself
out
so
gallantly
open
at
the
throat
and
his
white
linen
stained
with
a
few
little
splotches
of
red
beside
him
knelt
miss
betty
holding
her
lace
handkerchief
upon
his
breast
she
was
as
white
as
he
and
as
motionless
so
that
as
she
knelt
there
immovable
beside
him
her
arm
like
alabaster
across
his
breast
they
might
have
been
a
sculptor
group
the
handkerchief
was
stained
a
little
like
the
linen
and
like
it
too
stained
but
a
little
nearby
on
the
floor
stood
a
flask
of
brandy
and
a
pitcher
of
water
you
miss
betty
face
showed
no
change
nor
even
a
faint
surprise
as
her
eyes
fell
upon
tom
vanrevel
but
her
lips
soundlessly
framed
the
word
you
tom
flung
himself
on
his
knees
beside
her
crailey
he
cried
in
a
sharp
voice
that
had
a
terrible
shake
in
it
crailey
crailey
i
want
you
to
hear
me
he
took
one
of
the
limp
hands
in
his
and
began
to
chafe
it
while
tanberry
grasped
the
other
there
still
a
movement
in
the
pulse
she
faltered
still
echoed
tom
roughly
you
mad
you
made
me
think
crailey
was
dead
do
you
think
crailey
gray
is
going
to
die
he
could
i
tell
you
he
could
you
do
know
him
who
gone
for
the
doctor
he
dashed
some
brandy
upon
his
handkerchief
and
set
it
to
the
white
lips
mamie
she
was
here
in
the
room
with
me
when
it
he
mocked
her
furiously
is
a
beautiful
word
god
forgive
me
sobbed
tanberry
i
was
sitting
in
the
library
and
mamie
had
just
come
from
you
when
we
heard
carewe
shout
from
the
cupola
room
away
from
my
daughter
vanrevel
and
take
this
like
a
dog
only
that
and
mamie
and
i
ran
to
the
window
and
we
saw
through
the
dusk
a
man
in
uniform
leap
back
from
miss
betty
they
were
in
that
little
open
space
near
the
hedge
he
called
out
something
and
waved
his
hand
but
the
shot
came
at
the
same
time
and
he
fell
even
then
i
was
sure
in
spite
of
what
mamie
had
said
i
was
as
sure
as
robert
carewe
was
that
it
was
you
he
came
and
took
one
look
and
saw
and
then
nelson
brought
the
horses
and
made
him
mount
and
go
mamie
ran
for
the
doctor
and
betty
and
i
carried
crailey
in
it
was
hard
miss
betty
hand
had
fallen
from
crailey
breast
where
tom
took
its
place
she
rose
unsteadily
to
her
feet
and
pushed
back
the
hair
from
her
forehead
shivering
convulsively
as
she
looked
down
at
the
motionless
figure
on
the
sofa
crailey
said
tom
in
the
same
angry
shaking
voice
crailey
got
to
rouse
yourself
this
wo
do
you
got
to
be
a
man
crailey
he
was
trying
to
force
the
brandy
through
the
tightly
clenched
teeth
crailey
crailey
whispered
miss
betty
leaning
heavily
on
the
back
of
a
chair
crailey
she
looked
at
tanberry
with
vague
interrogation
but
tanberry
did
not
understand
crailey
it
was
then
that
crailey
eyelids
fluttered
and
slowly
opened
and
his
wandering
glance
dull
at
first
slowly
grew
clear
and
twinkling
as
it
rested
on
the
ashy
stricken
face
of
his
best
friend
tom
he
said
feebly
it
was
worth
the
price
to
wear
your
clothes
just
once
and
then
at
last
miss
betty
saw
and
understood
for
not
the
honest
gentleman
whom
everyone
except
robert
carewe
held
in
esteem
and
not
her
father
enemy
vanrevel
lay
before
her
with
the
in
his
breast
for
her
sake
but
that
other
crailey
gray
the
and
crailey
gray
wit
poet
and
scapegrace
the
town
scamp
he
saw
that
she
knew
and
as
his
brightening
eyes
wandered
up
to
her
he
smiled
faintly
even
a
bad
dog
likes
to
have
his
day
he
whispered
chapter
xix
the
flag
goes
marching
by
will
cummings
had
abandoned
the
pen
for
the
sword
until
such
time
as
santa
anna
should
cry
for
quarter
and
had
left
the
office
in
charge
of
an
imported
substitute
but
late
that
night
he
came
to
his
desk
once
more
to
write
the
story
of
the
accident
to
corporal
gray
and
the
tale
that
he
wrote
had
been
already
put
into
writing
by
tom
vanrevel
as
it
fell
from
crailey
lips
after
the
doctor
had
come
so
that
none
might
doubt
it
no
one
did
doubt
it
what
reason
had
carewe
to
injure
crailey
gray
only
five
in
rouen
knew
the
truth
for
nelson
had
gone
with
his
master
and
except
mamie
the
other
servants
of
the
carewe
household
had
been
among
the
crowd
in
front
of
the
rouen
house
when
the
shot
was
fired
so
the
story
went
over
the
town
how
crailey
had
called
to
say
to
tanberry
how
carewe
happened
to
be
examining
the
musket
his
father
had
carried
in
when
the
weapon
was
accidentally
discharged
the
ball
entering
crailey
breast
how
carewe
stricken
with
remorse
and
horror
over
this
frightful
misfortune
and
suffering
too
severe
anguish
of
mind
to
remain
upon
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
which
his
carelessness
had
made
had
fled
attended
by
his
servant
and
how
they
had
leaped
aboard
the
evening
boat
as
it
was
pulling
out
and
were
now
on
their
way
down
the
river
and
this
was
the
story
too
that
tom
told
fanchon
for
it
was
he
who
brought
her
to
crailey
through
the
long
night
she
knelt
at
side
his
hand
always
pressed
to
her
breast
or
cheek
her
eyes
always
upward
and
her
lips
moving
with
her
prayers
not
for
crailey
to
be
spared
but
that
the
father
would
take
good
care
of
him
in
heaven
till
she
came
i
had
already
given
him
up
she
said
to
tom
meekly
in
a
small
voice
i
knew
it
was
to
come
and
perhaps
this
way
is
better
than
that
i
thought
it
would
be
far
away
from
me
now
i
can
be
with
him
and
perhaps
i
shall
have
him
a
little
longer
for
he
was
to
have
gone
away
before
the
morning
sun
rose
upon
a
fair
world
gay
with
from
the
big
trees
of
the
carewe
place
and
pleasant
with
the
odors
of
miss
betty
garden
and
crailey
lying
upon
the
bed
of
the
man
who
had
shot
him
hearkened
and
smiled
to
the
summer
he
loved
and
when
the
day
broke
asked
that
the
bed
be
moved
so
that
he
might
lie
close
by
the
window
it
was
tom
who
had
borne
him
to
that
room
i
have
carried
him
before
this
he
said
waving
the
others
aside
not
long
after
sunrise
when
the
bed
had
been
moved
near
the
window
crailey
begged
fanchon
to
bring
him
a
miniature
of
his
mother
which
he
had
given
her
and
urged
her
to
go
for
it
herself
he
wanted
no
hands
but
hers
to
touch
it
he
said
and
when
she
had
gone
he
asked
to
be
left
alone
with
tom
give
me
your
hand
tom
he
said
faintly
i
like
to
keep
hold
of
it
a
minute
or
so
i
could
have
said
that
yesterday
could
i
without
causing
us
both
horrible
embarrassment
but
i
fancy
i
can
now
because
i
done
for
that
too
bad
is
it
i
very
young
after
all
do
you
remember
what
poor
andre
chenier
said
as
he
went
up
to
be
guillotined
there
were
things
in
this
head
of
mine
but
i
want
to
tell
you
what
been
the
matter
with
me
it
was
just
my
being
a
bad
sort
of
poet
i
suppose
that
i
never
loved
anyone
yet
i
cared
more
deeply
than
other
men
for
every
lovely
thing
i
ever
saw
and
there
so
little
that
has
loveliness
in
it
i
be
ashamed
not
to
have
cared
for
the
beauty
in
all
the
women
i
made
love
to
but
about
this
one
the
most
beautiful
of
all
i
she
will
understand
said
tom
quickly
she
will
yes
she
wise
and
good
if
fanchon
knew
there
be
even
a
memory
left
to
her
and
i
do
think
she
live
and
do
you
know
i
believe
i
done
a
favor
for
miss
betty
in
getting
myself
shot
carewe
will
never
come
back
tom
was
ever
a
man
knavery
so
exactly
the
architect
of
his
own
destruction
as
mine
and
for
what
gain
just
the
excitement
of
the
comedy
from
day
to
day
for
she
was
sure
to
despise
me
as
soon
as
she
knew
and
the
desire
to
hear
her
voice
say
another
kindly
thing
to
me
and
the
everlasting
perhaps
in
every
woman
and
this
one
the
heart
desire
of
all
the
world
ah
well
tell
me
i
want
to
hear
it
from
you
how
many
hours
does
the
doctor
say
hours
crailey
tom
hand
twitched
pitifully
in
the
other
feeble
grasp
i
know
it
only
a
they
all
fools
doctors
exclaimed
vanrevel
fiercely
no
no
and
i
know
that
nothing
can
be
done
you
all
see
it
and
you
want
me
to
go
easily
or
you
would
let
me
have
my
own
way
so
much
it
frightens
me
i
own
up
to
think
that
so
soon
i
be
wiser
than
the
wisest
in
the
world
yet
i
always
wanted
to
know
i
sought
and
sought
but
now
to
go
out
alone
on
the
search
it
must
be
the
search
for
the
holy
grail
i
please
do
talk
begged
tom
in
a
broken
whisper
for
mercy
sake
lad
it
wears
on
you
crailey
laughed
weakly
do
you
think
i
could
die
peacefully
without
talking
a
great
deal
there
one
thing
i
want
tom
i
want
to
see
all
of
them
once
more
all
the
old
friends
that
are
going
down
the
river
at
noon
what
harm
could
it
do
i
want
them
to
come
by
here
on
their
way
to
the
boat
with
the
band
and
the
new
flag
but
i
want
the
band
to
play
cheerfully
ask
to
play
the
bow
will
you
i
never
believed
in
mournfulness
and
i
do
want
to
see
any
of
it
now
the
rankest
impiety
of
all
and
besides
i
want
to
see
them
as
be
when
they
come
marching
home
they
must
look
gay
ah
do
lad
do
tom
flung
one
arm
about
the
other
shoulder
and
crailey
was
silent
but
rested
his
hand
gently
on
his
friend
head
in
that
attitude
fanchon
found
them
when
she
came
the
volunteers
gathered
at
the
two
hours
before
noon
they
met
each
other
dismally
speaking
in
undertones
as
they
formed
in
lines
of
four
while
their
dispirited
faces
showed
that
the
heart
was
out
of
them
not
so
with
the
crowds
of
country
folk
and
townspeople
who
lined
the
streets
to
see
the
last
of
them
for
these
when
the
band
came
marching
down
the
street
and
took
its
place
set
up
a
royal
cheering
that
grew
louder
as
jefferson
bareaud
the
carried
the
flag
to
the
head
of
the
procession
with
the
recruits
marched
the
veterans
of
and
the
indian
wars
the
cobbler
stumping
along
beside
general
trumble
who
looked
very
dejected
and
old
the
lines
stood
in
silence
and
responded
to
the
cheering
by
quietly
removing
their
hats
so
that
the
people
whispered
that
it
was
more
like
an
odd
fellows
sunday
funeral
than
the
departure
of
enthusiastic
patriots
for
the
seat
of
war
general
trumble
was
not
the
only
sad
face
in
the
ranks
all
were
downcast
and
nervous
even
those
of
the
lads
from
the
country
who
had
not
known
the
comrade
they
were
to
leave
behind
jefferson
unfurled
the
flag
marsh
gave
the
word
of
command
the
band
began
to
play
a
and
the
procession
moved
forward
down
the
cheering
lane
of
people
who
waved
little
flags
and
handkerchiefs
and
threw
their
hats
in
the
air
as
they
shouted
but
contrary
to
expectation
the
parade
was
not
directly
along
main
street
to
the
river
right
wheel
march
commanded
tappingham
hoarsely
waving
his
sword
and
jefferson
led
the
way
into
carewe
street
for
god
sake
do
cry
now
and
tappingham
with
a
large
drop
streaking
down
his
own
cheek
turned
savagely
upon
lieutenant
cummings
that
is
what
he
wants
he
wants
to
see
us
looking
cheery
and
smiling
we
can
do
it
for
him
this
once
i
guess
i
never
saw
him
any
other
you
look
damn
smiling
yourself
snuffled
will
i
will
when
we
turn
in
at
the
gates
retorted
his
captain
on
my
soul
i
swear
i
kill
every
sniffling
idiot
that
does
in
line
there
he
stormed
ferociously
at
a
big
recruit
the
lively
strains
of
the
band
and
the
shouting
of
the
people
grew
louder
and
louder
in
the
room
where
crailey
lay
his
eyes
glistened
as
he
heard
and
he
smiled
not
the
old
smile
of
the
worldly
prelate
but
merrily
like
a
child
when
music
is
heard
the
room
was
darkened
save
for
the
light
of
the
one
window
which
fell
softly
upon
his
head
and
breast
and
upon
another
fair
head
close
to
his
where
fanchon
knelt
in
the
shadows
at
one
end
of
the
room
were
miss
betty
and
tanberry
and
bareaud
and
the
doctor
who
had
said
let
him
have
his
own
way
in
all
he
tom
stood
alone
close
by
the
head
of
the
couch
hail
to
the
band
crailey
chuckled
softly
how
the
rogues
keep
the
time
it
the
bow
all
right
ah
that
is
as
it
should
be
tanberry
you
and
i
have
one
thing
in
common
if
you
let
me
flatter
myself
so
far
we
always
believed
in
good
cheer
in
spite
of
the
devil
and
all
you
and
i
eh
the
best
of
things
even
if
things
are
bad
dear
lady
eh
you
darling
vagabond
tanberry
murmured
trying
to
smile
back
to
him
hark
to
said
crailey
they
very
near
only
hear
the
people
cheer
them
they
away
so
gaily
wo
they
and
how
right
that
is
the
vanguard
appeared
in
the
street
and
over
the
hedge
gleamed
the
oncoming
banner
the
fresh
colors
flying
out
on
a
strong
breeze
crailey
greeted
it
with
a
breathless
cry
there
the
flag
look
fanchon
your
flag
waving
above
the
hedge
and
it
jeff
who
carries
it
does
it
always
make
you
want
to
dance
bravo
bravo
the
procession
halted
for
a
moment
in
the
street
and
the
music
ceased
then
with
a
jubilant
flourish
of
brass
and
the
roll
of
drums
the
band
struck
up
the
star
spangled
banner
and
jefferson
bareaud
proudly
led
the
way
through
the
gates
and
down
the
driveway
the
bright
silk
streaming
overhead
behind
him
briskly
marched
the
volunteers
with
heads
erect
and
cheerful
faces
as
they
knew
corporal
gray
wished
to
see
them
their
captain
flourishing
his
sword
in
the
air
here
they
come
do
you
see
fanchon
cried
crailey
excitedly
they
are
all
there
jeff
and
tappingham
and
the
two
madrillons
and
will
the
dear
old
fellow
he
never
write
a
decent
paragraph
as
long
as
he
lives
god
bless
him
and
young
frank
what
deviltries
i
led
the
boy
into
and
there
the
old
general
forgetting
all
the
tiffs
we
had
god
bless
them
all
and
grant
them
all
a
safe
return
what
on
earth
are
they
taking
off
their
hats
for
ah
boys
they
saw
the
white
face
at
the
window
and
the
slender
hand
fluttering
its
farewell
and
tappingham
halted
his
men
three
times
three
for
corporal
gray
he
shouted
managing
somehow
to
keep
the
smile
upon
his
lips
three
times
three
and
may
he
rejoin
his
company
before
we
enter
the
mexican
capital
he
beat
the
time
for
the
thunderous
cheers
that
they
gave
the
procession
described
a
circle
on
the
lawn
and
then
with
the
band
playing
and
colors
flying
passed
out
of
the
gates
and
took
up
the
march
to
the
wharf
the
flag
the
flag
whispered
crailey
following
it
with
his
eyes
it
shows
that
you
helped
make
it
fanchon
it
so
beautiful
ah
tom
they
said
we
abused
it
sometimes
it
was
only
that
we
loved
it
so
well
we
did
like
to
see
anyone
make
it
look
silly
or
mean
but
after
all
no
man
can
do
that
no
nor
no
group
of
men
nor
party
his
voice
grew
louder
as
the
last
strains
of
the
music
came
more
faintly
from
the
street
they
take
your
banner
across
the
rio
grande
fanchon
but
that
is
not
all
some
day
its
stars
must
spread
over
the
world
you
all
see
that
they
will
after
a
little
while
he
closed
his
eyes
with
a
sigh
the
doctor
bent
over
him
quickly
and
miss
betty
started
forward
unconsciously
and
cried
out
but
the
bright
eyes
opened
again
and
fixed
themselves
upon
her
with
all
their
old
gay
inscrutability
not
yet
said
crailey
miss
carewe
may
i
tell
you
that
i
am
sorry
i
could
not
have
known
you
sooner
perhaps
you
might
have
liked
me
for
fanchon
sake
i
know
you
care
for
i
do
i
do
she
faltered
i
love
her
and
ah
i
do
like
you
gray
for
i
know
you
though
i
never
met
you
until
last
night
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
she
wavered
a
moment
like
a
lily
in
the
wind
and
put
out
a
hand
blindly
not
you
she
said
sharply
as
tom
vanrevel
started
toward
her
tanberry
came
quickly
and
put
an
arm
about
her
and
together
they
went
out
of
the
room
you
must
be
good
to
her
tom
said
crailey
then
in
a
very
low
voice
i
answered
tom
gently
there
was
never
a
chance
of
that
listen
whispered
crailey
lean
down
no
he
cast
a
quick
glance
at
fanchon
kneeling
at
the
other
side
of
the
bed
her
golden
head
on
the
white
coverlet
her
outstretched
hand
clutching
his
and
he
spoke
so
close
to
tom
ear
and
in
so
low
a
tone
that
only
tom
could
hear
she
never
cared
for
me
she
felt
that
she
ought
to
but
that
was
only
because
i
masqueraded
in
your
history
she
wanted
to
tell
me
before
i
went
away
that
there
was
no
chance
for
me
she
was
telling
me
that
when
he
called
from
the
window
it
was
at
the
dance
the
night
before
that
she
knew
i
think
there
has
been
someone
else
from
the
first
god
send
it
you
did
you
speak
to
her
that
night
or
she
to
you
ah
no
said
tom
vanrevel
all
the
tanberry
and
betty
and
bareaud
waited
in
the
library
the
two
women
huddled
together
on
a
sofa
with
their
arms
round
each
other
and
all
the
house
was
very
still
by
and
by
they
heard
a
prolonged
cheering
and
the
steamer
whistle
and
knew
that
the
boat
was
off
half
an
hour
later
will
cummings
came
back
alone
entered
the
room
on
and
silently
sank
into
a
chair
near
bareaud
with
his
face
away
from
miss
betty
he
was
to
remain
in
rouen
another
week
and
join
his
regiment
with
tom
none
of
the
three
appeared
to
notice
his
coming
more
than
dimly
and
he
sat
with
his
face
bowed
in
his
hands
and
did
not
move
thus
perhaps
an
hour
passed
with
only
a
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
gravel
of
the
driveway
now
and
then
and
a
low
murmur
of
voices
in
the
rear
of
the
house
where
people
came
to
ask
after
crailey
and
when
the
door
of
the
room
where
he
lay
was
opened
the
four
watchers
started
as
at
a
loud
explosion
it
was
bareaud
and
the
old
doctor
and
they
closed
the
door
again
softly
and
came
in
to
the
others
they
had
left
crailey
alone
with
fanchon
and
tom
vanrevel
the
two
who
loved
him
best
the
warm
day
beyond
the
windows
became
like
sunday
no
voices
sounded
from
without
in
the
noon
hush
though
sometimes
a
little
group
of
people
would
gather
across
the
street
to
eye
the
house
curiously
and
nod
and
whisper
the
strong
blue
shadows
of
the
veranda
pillars
stole
slowly
across
the
white
floor
of
the
porch
in
a
lessening
slant
and
finally
lay
all
in
a
line
as
the
tall
clock
in
a
corner
of
the
library
asthmatically
coughed
the
hour
of
noon
in
this
jarring
discordance
there
was
something
frightful
to
miss
betty
she
rose
abruptly
and
imperiously
waving
back
tanberry
who
would
have
detained
her
for
there
was
in
her
face
and
manner
the
incipient
wildness
of
control
overstrained
to
the
she
went
hurriedly
out
of
the
room
and
out
of
the
house
to
the
old
bench
in
the
garden
there
she
sank
down
her
face
hidden
in
her
arms
there
on
the
spot
where
she
had
first
seen
crailey
gray
from
there
too
had
risen
the
serenade
of
the
man
she
had
spurned
and
insulted
and
there
she
had
come
to
worship
the
stars
when
crailey
bade
her
look
to
them
and
now
the
strange
young
teacher
was
paying
the
bitter
price
for
his
fooleries
and
who
could
doubt
that
the
price
was
a
bitter
one
to
have
the
spirit
so
suddenly
cruelly
riven
from
the
sprightly
body
that
was
but
a
few
hours
ago
hale
and
alert
obedient
to
every
petty
wish
could
dance
run
and
leap
to
be
forced
with
such
hideous
precipitation
to
leave
the
warm
breath
of
june
and
undergo
the
lonely
change
merging
with
the
shadow
to
be
flung
from
the
exquisite
and
commonplace
day
of
sunshine
into
the
appalling
adventure
that
should
not
have
been
his
for
years
and
hurled
into
it
by
what
hand
ah
bitter
bitter
price
for
a
harlequinade
and
alas
alas
for
the
brave
harlequin
a
gentle
touch
fell
upon
her
shoulder
and
miss
betty
sprang
to
her
feet
and
screamed
it
was
nelson
who
stood
before
her
hat
in
hand
his
head
deeply
bowed
is

cried
clutching
at
the
bench
for

when
he
come
an
look
down
at
dat
young
man
layin
on
de
grass
las
night
the
old
fellow
bent
his
back
before
her
in
a
solemn
bow
as
a
feudal
retainer
in
allegiance
to
the
heir
but
more
in
deference
to
the
sorrow
written
upon
her
and
respecting
its
magnitude
with
no
words
of
comfort
for
he
knew
she
wanted
only
to
be
alone
he
moved
away
with
infirm
steps
and
shaking
head
toward
the
rear
of
the
house
miss
betty
threw
herself
upon
the
bench
again
face
downward
in
her
arms
and
still
the
house
lay
in
silence
under
the
sunshine
an
hour
had
passed
and
the
shadows
slanted
strongly
to
the
east
when
the
stillness
was
broken
by
a
sound
low
and
small
at
first
then
rising
fearfully
a
long
quavering
wail
of
supreme
anguish
that
clutched
and
shook
the
listener
heart
no
one
could
have
recognized
the
voice
as
fanchon
yet
everyone
who
heard
it
knew
that
it
was
hers
and
that
the
soul
of
crailey
gray
had
gone
out
upon
the
quest
for
the
holy
grail
miss
betty
hands
clenched
convulsively
round
the
arm
of
the
bench
and
a
fit
of
shuddering
seized
her
as
if
with
the
grip
of
a
violent
chill
though
her
eyes
were
dry
then
she
lay
quiet
a
long
time
afterward
she
became
aware
of
a
step
that
paced
the
garden
path
behind
her
and
turned
her
face
upon
her
arm
so
that
she
saw
but
made
no
other
motion
it
was
tom
vanrevel
walking
slowly
up
and
down
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
his
hat
pulled
far
down
over
his
eyes
he
had
not
seen
her
she
rose
and
spoke
his
name
he
turned
and
came
to
her
almost
at
the
very
last
he
said
crailey
whispered
to
me
that
he
knew
you
thought
him
a
great
scamp
but
to
tell
you
to
be
sure
to
remember
that
it
was
all
true
about
the
chapter
xx
goodby
it
was
between
twilight
and
candlelight
the
gentle
when
the
kind
old
sand
man
steals
up
the
stairs
of
houses
where
children
are
when
rustic
lovers
stroll
with
slow
and
quiet
steps
down
country
lanes
and
old
bachelors
are
loneliest
and
dream
of
the
things
that
might
have
been
through
the
silence
of
the
clear
dusk
came
the
whistle
of
the
evening
boat
that
was
to
bear
tom
vanrevel
through
the
first
stage
of
his
long
journey
to
the
front
of
war
and
the
sound
fell
cheerlessly
upon
miss
betty
ear
as
she
stood
leaning
against
the
among
the
lilac
bushes
her
attitude
was
not
one
of
reverie
yet
she
stood
very
still
so
still
that
in
the
wan
shimmer
of
the
faded
afterglow
one
might
have
passed
close
by
her
and
not
have
seen
her
the
long
dark
folds
of
her
gown
showed
faintly
against
the
gray
stone
and
her
arms
bare
from
the
elbow
lay
across
the
face
of
the
dial
with
unrelaxed
fingers
clenching
the
cornice
her
head
drooping
not
languidly
but
with
tension
her
eyes
showing
the
lashes
against
a
pale
cheek
and
thus
motionless
leaning
on
the
stone
in
the
dusk
she
might
have
been
sorrow
self
she
did
not
move
there
was
not
even
a
flicker
of
the
eyelashes
when
a
step
sounded
on
the
gravel
of
the
driveway
and
vanrevel
came
slowly
from
the
house
he
stopped
at
a
little
distance
from
her
hat
in
hand
he
was
very
thin
worn
and
and
in
the
failing
light
might
have
been
taken
for
a
tall
gentle
ghost
yet
his
shoulders
were
squared
and
he
held
himself
as
straight
as
he
had
the
first
time
she
had
ever
seen
him
mrs
tanberry
told
me
i
should
find
you
here
he
said
hesitatingly
i
have
come
to
say
she
did
not
turn
toward
him
nor
did
more
than
her
lips
move
as
she
answered
and
her
tone
was
neither
kind
nor
cold
but
held
no
meaning
whatever
not
even
indifference
there
was
an
interval
of
silence
then
without
surprise
he
walked
sadly
to
the
gate
paused
wheeled
about
suddenly
and
returned
with
a
quick
firm
step
i
will
not
go
until
i
know
that
i
do
not
misunderstand
you
he
said
not
even
if
there
is
only
the
slightest
chance
that
i
do
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
if
you
will
let
me
though
naturally
i
remember
you
once
asked
me
never
to
speak
to
you
again
it
is
only
that
i
have
thought
you
did
that
under
a
misconception
or
else
i
should
still
obey
you
if
you
what
is
it
that
you
wish
to
say
her
tone
was
unchanged
only
that
i
think
the
hardest
time
for
you
has
passed
and
that
do
you
she
interrupted
yes
he
returned
the
saddest
of
your
life
i
think
it
has
gone
forever
and
i
think
that
what
will
come
to
you
will
be
all
you
wish
for
there
will
be
a
little
time
of
waiting
waiting
for
what
he
drew
a
step
nearer
and
his
voice
became
very
gentle
cummings
and
i
reach
our
regiment
tomorrow
night
and
there
in
the
camp
is
a
group
of
men
on
the
way
to
the
war
and
they
all
go
the
more
bravely
because
each
one
of
them
has
you
in
his
heart
not
one
but
will
be
a
better
soldier
because
of
you
i
want
you
to
believe
that
if
all
of
them
do
come
back
yet
the
one
whose
safety
you
think
of
and
fear
for
will
return
for
you
see
crailey
told
me
what
you
said
to
him
when
when
he
met
you
here
the
last
time
i
have
no
way
to
know
which
of
them
you
meant
but
he
will
come
back
to
you
i
am
sure
of
it
because
i
believe
you
are
to
be
happy
ah
you
had
your
allotment
of
pain
after
all
there
is
so
little
to
regret
the
town
seems
empty
without
its
young
men
yet
you
may
rejoice
remembering
how
bravely
they
went
and
how
gaily
they
will
sing
half
the
way
to
vera
cruz
you
think
it
strange
i
should
say
there
is
so
little
to
regret
when
i
just
laid
away
my
best
friend
it
was
his
own
doctrine
and
the
selfish
personal
grief
and
soreness
grows
less
when
i
think
of
the
gallant
end
he
made
for
it
was
he
who
went
away
most
bravely
and
jauntily
of
all
crailey
was
no
failure
unless
i
let
what
he
taught
me
go
to
no
effect
and
be
sure
he
would
have
told
you
what
i
tell
you
now
that
all
is
well
with
all
in
the
please
she
cried
with
a
quick
intake
of
breath
through
closed
teeth
i
will
do
anything
in
the
world
to
please
you
he
answered
sorrowfully
do
you
mean
that
she
turned
at
last
and
faced
him
but
without
lifting
her
eyes
why
did
you
come
to
say
to
me
i
do
i
think
you
her
voice
was
cold
and
steady
but
it
was
suddenly
given
to
him
to
perceive
that
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
heel
an
exclamation
of
remorse
broke
from
him
ah
you
came
here
to
be
alone
i
stop
she
said
you
said
to
me
once
before
did
you
come
to
see
what
you
saw
then
he
fell
back
in
utter
amazement
but
she
advanced
upon
him
swiftly
was
it
that
she
cried
the
unfortunate
young
man
could
make
no
reply
and
remained
unable
to
defend
himself
from
her
inexplicable
attack
you
have
not
forgotten
she
went
on
impetuously
it
was
in
the
crowd
just
before
they
gave
you
the
flag
you
saw
i
know
you
saw
and
it
killed
me
with
the
shame
of
it
now
you
come
to
me
to
look
at
the
same
thing
again
and
the
boat
waiting
for
you
is
it
in
revenge
for
that
night
at
the
bareauds
perhaps
this
sounds
wild
to
you
i
help
that
but
why
should
you
try
to
make
it
harder
for
me
from
the
porch
came
a
strong
voice
vanrevel
god
knows
i
have
meant
to
said
tom
in
bitter
pain
i
understand
it
cummings
calling
for
me
i
go
at
once
i
hoped
stupidly
enough
that
you
would
tell
me
whom
it
was
you
meant
when
you
spoke
to
crailey
so
that
i
could
help
to
make
it
surer
that
he
come
back
to
you
but
i
only
annoyed
you
and
you
were
here
away
from
the
house
avoiding
me
and
fearing
that
i
vanrevel
shouted
william
tanberry
had
not
told
lieutenant
cummings
where
to
find
miss
betty
fearing
yes
fearing
that
i
might
discover
he
let
his
eyes
rest
on
her
loveliness
once
more
and
as
he
saw
that
she
still
trembled
he
extended
his
hand
toward
her
in
a
gesture
of
infinite
gentleness
like
a
blessing
heaved
one
great
sigh
and
with
head
erect
and
body
straight
set
his
face
manfully
toward
the
house
he
had
taken
three
strides
when
his
heart
stopped
beating
at
an
ineffable
touch
on
his
sleeve
for
with
a
sharp
cry
she
sprang
to
him
and
then
once
more
among
the
lilac
bushes
where
he
had
caught
the
white
kitten
his
hand
was
seized
and
held
between
two
small
palms
and
the
eyes
of
miss
betty
carewe
looked
into
the
very
soul
of
him
no
she
cried
no
fearing
with
a
sick
heart
that
you
might
not
come
her
pale
face
misty
with
sweetness
wavered
before
him
in
the
dusk
and
he
lifted
his
shaking
hand
to
his
forehead
her
own
went
with
it
and
the
touch
of
that
steadied
him
you
mean
he
whispered
brokenly
you
mean
that
you
yes
always
she
answered
rushing
through
the
words
half
in
tears
there
was
a
little
time
when
i
loved
what
your
life
had
been
more
than
you
ah
it
was
you
that
i
saw
in
him
yet
it
was
not
what
you
had
done
after
all
but
just
you
i
knew
there
could
not
be
anyone
else
though
i
thought
it
could
never
be
you
that
night
just
before
they
gave
the
we
little
time
vanrevel
called
the
voice
from
the
porch
tom
eyes
filled
slowly
he
raised
them
and
looked
at
the
newly
come
stars
crailey
crailey
he
murmured
her
gaze
followed
his
ah
it
he
and
they
that
make
me
know
you
will
come
back
to
me
she
said
