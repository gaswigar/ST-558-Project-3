it
was
my
privilege
many
years
ago
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
obscure
literary
hermit
whose
talk
i
have
tried
to
reproduce
in
the
pages
that
follow
our
first
meeting
was
one
of
those
chance
affairs
that
now
and
then
mitigate
the
loneliness
of
the
london
streets
and
a
second
hazard
led
to
the
discovery
that
we
had
many
interests
in
common
i
think
that
the
hermit
as
i
shall
call
him
had
begun
to
find
the
perpetual
solitude
of
his
years
a
growing
terror
and
he
was
not
sorry
to
have
a
listener
at
first
indeed
he
talked
almost
with
the
joy
of
a
child
or
rather
of
a
prisoner
who
has
escaped
from
the
house
of
silence
but
as
he
chose
subjects
which
have
always
interested
me
intensely
he
gave
as
much
pleasure
as
he
received
and
i
became
an
assiduous
visitor
of
his
cell
he
had
found
an
odd
retreat
he
avoided
personalities
and
had
a
happy
knack
of
forgetting
any
that
i
vouchsafed
on
my
side
he
forgot
my
name
three
times
on
the
first
evening
that
we
spent
together
and
succeeded
in
repeating
this
feat
over
and
over
again
since
then
and
i
never
gathered
much
of
his
past
history
but
i
believe
that
something
had
happened
many
years
before
in
the
prehistoric
age
of
the
there
had
been
a
break
of
some
sort
in
the
man
life
when
he
was
quite
young
and
so
he
had
left
the
world
and
gone
to
barnsbury
an
almost
mythical
region
lying
between
pentonville
and
the
caledonian
road
here
in
the
most
retired
street
of
that
retired
quarter
he
occupied
two
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
of
a
big
mouldy
house
standing
apart
from
the
street
and
sheltered
by
gaunt
grown
trees
and
ancient
shrubs
and
just
beside
the
dim
and
dusty
window
of
the
a
laburnum
had
cast
a
green
stain
on
the
decaying
wall
the
laburnum
had
grown
wild
like
all
the
trees
and
shrubs
and
some
of
its
black
straggling
boughs
brushed
the
pane
and
of
dark
windy
nights
while
we
sat
together
and
talked
of
art
and
life
we
would
be
startled
by
the
sudden
violence
with
which
those
branches
beat
angrily
upon
the
glass
the
room
seemed
always
dark
i
suppose
that
the
house
had
been
built
in
the
early
eighteenth
century
and
had
been
altered
and
added
to
at
various
periods
with
a
final
doing
up
for
the
comparative
luxury
of
someone
in
the
or
there
were
i
think
twenty
rooms
in
it
and
my
friend
used
to
declare
that
when
a
new
servant
came
she
spent
many
months
in
finding
her
way
in
the
complicated
maze
of
stairs
and
passages
and
that
the
landlady
even
was
now
and
then
at
fault
but
the
room
in
which
we
sat
was
hung
with
flock
paper
of
a
deep
and
heavy
crimson
colour
and
even
on
bright
summer
evenings
the
crimson
looked
almost
black
and
seemed
to
cast
a
shadow
into
the
room
often
we
sat
there
till
the
veritable
darkness
came
and
each
could
scarcely
see
the
white
of
the
other
face
and
then
my
friend
would
light
two
lonely
candles
on
the
mantelpiece
or
if
he
wished
to
read
he
set
one
on
a
table
beside
him
and
when
the
candles
were
lighted
i
thought
that
the
gloom
grew
more
intense
and
looking
through
the
uncurtained
window
one
could
not
see
even
the
friendly
twinkle
of
the
in
the
street
but
only
the
vague
growth
of
the
laburnum
and
the
tangle
of
boughs
beyond
it
was
a
large
room
and
gave
me
always
a
sense
of
empty
space
against
one
wall
stood
a
heavy
bookcase
with
glass
doors
solid
and
of
dark
mahogany
but
made
in
the
intermediate
period
that
came
between
chippendale
and
the
modern
school
of
rubbish
in
the
duskiest
corner
of
the
room
there
was
a
secretaire
of
better
workmanship
and
two
small
tables
and
three
gaunt
chairs
made
up
the
furnishing
the
hermit
would
sometimes
pace
up
and
down
in
the
void
centre
of
the
room
as
he
talked
and
if
i
chanced
to
be
sitting
by
the
window
his
shape
would
almost
disappear
as
he
neared
the
secretaire
on
his
march
and
i
heard
the
voice
and
used
to
wonder
for
a
moment
whether
the
man
had
not
vanished
for
ever
having
been
resolved
into
the
shadows
about
him
i
have
spent
many
evenings
in
that
old
mouldering
room
where
when
we
were
silent
for
an
instant
the
inanimate
matter
about
us
found
a
voice
and
the
decaying
beams
murmured
together
and
a
vague
sound
might
come
from
the
cellars
underneath
and
it
always
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
odour
of
the
cellar
rose
also
into
the
room
mingling
with
a
faint
suggestion
of
incense
though
i
am
sure
that
my
friend
never
burned
it
here
then
with
such
surroundings
as
i
have
indicated
we
held
our
sessions
and
talked
freely
and
with
enjoyment
of
many
curious
things
which
as
the
hermit
would
say
had
the
huge
merit
of
interesting
no
one
but
ourselves
he
would
sometimes
whimsically
compare
himself
to
coleridge
and
i
think
that
he
often
deliberately
talked
in
manner
with
delight
in
the
joke
for
i
need
hardly
say
that
the
comparison
was
not
in
any
way
a
serious
one
he
had
a
veneration
for
achievement
with
a
still
greater
veneration
for
that
which
coleridge
might
have
achieved
which
would
have
caused
him
to
regard
any
such
comparison
seriously
entertained
as
unspeakably
ludicrous
still
he
liked
to
regard
himself
as
a
very
humble
disciple
in
coleridge
school
he
was
fond
as
i
have
said
of
imitating
his
master
manner
as
well
as
he
could
and
i
think
that
he
cherished
in
the
fashion
of
the
notion
that
he
had
a
system
an
esoteric
philosophy
of
things
he
sought
for
a
key
that
would
open
and
a
lamp
that
would
enlighten
all
the
dark
of
the
universe
and
sometimes
he
believed
that
he
held
both
the
key
and
the
lamp
in
his
hands
it
is
a
confession
of
mysticism
but
i
incline
to
think
that
he
was
right
in
this
belief
i
recall
the
presence
of
that
hollow
echoing
room
the
atmosphere
with
its
subtle
suggestion
of
incense
sweetening
the
dank
odours
of
the
cellar
and
the
tone
of
the
voice
speaking
to
me
and
i
believe
that
once
or
twice
we
both
saw
visions
and
some
glimpse
at
least
of
certain
eternal
ineffable
shapes
but
these
matters
the
more
esoteric
doctrines
of
the
system
have
entered
hardly
or
not
at
all
into
the
very
imperfect
and
fragmentary
notes
that
i
have
made
of
his
conversations
on
literature
i
should
scarcely
be
justified
in
calling
him
a
literary
monomaniac
but
it
is
true
that
art
in
general
and
the
art
of
literature
in
particular
had
for
him
a
very
high
significance
and
interest
and
he
was
always
ready
to
defend
the
thesis
that
all
the
arts
being
glorious
the
literary
art
was
the
most
glorious
and
wonderful
of
all
he
reverenced
music
but
he
was
firm
in
maintaining
that
in
perfect
lyrical
poetry
there
is
the
subtlest
and
most
beautiful
melody
in
the
world
i
can
scarcely
say
whether
he
wrote
much
himself
he
would
speak
of
stories
on
which
he
was
engaged
but
i
have
never
seen
his
name
on
publishers
lists
and
i
do
not
think
that
he
had
adopted
a
pseudonym
one
evening
i
remember
i
came
in
a
little
before
my
accustomed
time
and
in
the
shadowy
corner
of
the
room
a
drawer
in
the
secretaire
was
open
and
i
thought
that
it
looked
full
of
neat
manuscripts
but
i
never
spoke
to
him
about
his
literary
work
and
i
noticed
that
he
did
not
much
care
to
talk
of
literature
from
the
commercial
standpoint
it
is
perhaps
needless
to
say
that
i
consulted
my
friend
before
publishing
these
notes
of
his
conversations
i
had
been
forced
to
leave
london
for
some
months
and
i
wrote
to
him
from
the
country
requesting
his
permission
to
give
to
the
world
if
the
world
would
have
them
those
judgments
on
books
which
i
had
listened
to
in
barnsbury
his
reply
allowed
me
to
take
my
own
way
with
all
my
heart
so
long
as
you
make
me
sufficiently
apocryphal
i
am
not
going
to
compete
with
critics
whose
names
are
printed
in
the
papers
but
if
you
can
maintain
the
and
allow
your
readers
supposing
their
existence
to
believe
that
i
am
a
mere
figment
of
your
brain
you
can
print
my
ease
of
body
and
rest
of
reins
here
is
a
suggestion
for
a
title
what
do
you
say
to
in
barnsbury
but
i
really
had
no
notion
that
you
were
taking
notes
all
the
time
remember
keep
the
secret
the
i
regarded
this
as
a
very
liberal
license
and
i
have
tried
to
set
in
the
best
order
i
could
compass
the
system
so
far
as
it
relates
to
letters
i
do
not
pretend
that
i
am
a
reporter
for
i
had
to
trust
to
my
memory
and
though
i
tried
to
arrange
my
notes
at
the
time
i
fear
i
have
fallen
here
and
there
into
confusion
still
i
think
that
the
six
chapters
which
follow
will
seem
fairly
consecutive
in
their
argument
and
arrangement
and
the
appendix
a
confession
of
failure
is
in
reality
the
result
of
the
cyclical
mode
of
discoursing
in
which
the
hermit
jocularly
professed
to
follow
coleridge
perhaps
indeed
coleridge
was
deceived
and
my
dear
friend
with
him
in
the
hope
of
real
essential
knowledge
but
even
so
these
fragments
which
i
propose
are
evidence
that
the
latter
earnestly
desired
the
truth
and
sought
it
hieroglyphics
i
do
you
know
that
just
before
you
came
in
i
found
something
highly
significant
in
the
evening
paper
i
am
afraid
from
your
expression
that
you
rather
undervalue
the
influence
of
the
press
indeed
i
remember
one
day
when
we
were
out
together
you
swore
at
an
inoffensive
boy
who
tried
to
allure
us
with
news
of
all
the
winners
i
think
i
pointed
out
at
the
time
that
even
and
an
interest
in
events
are
preferable
to
stagnation
and
that
there
is
something
august
in
the
universal
human
passion
for
gambling
and
after
all
the
who
puts
on
is
really
only
an
example
of
the
love
of
man
for
the
unknown
the
is
a
venture
into
mystery
with
that
due
flavour
of
commercialism
which
we
in
england
add
to
most
of
our
interests
but
you
see
do
you
that
gambling
even
under
its
most
sordid
aspects
is
not
altogether
sordid
it
the
mystery
the
uncertainty
the
hours
of
strange
surmise
that
the
smallest
bet
gives
to
the
bettor
that
make
the
real
delight
of
betting
when
the
wins
and
gets
ten
shillings
for
the
risk
of
his
his
delight
is
not
by
any
means
pure
love
of
gain
it
is
distinguished
by
a
very
marked
line
from
the
constantly
repeated
joys
of
the
grocer
who
is
always
buying
delicious
tea
at
ninepence
and
selling
it
at
here
you
have
commercialism
in
its
simplest
form
but
our
though
he
likes
the
money
well
enough
stands
on
a
much
higher
plane
for
the
moment
he
is
the
man
who
has
succeeded
in
solving
the
enigma
of
the
sphinx
in
discovering
the
unknown
continent
in
reading
the
cypher
in
guessing
at
the
song
the
sirens
sang
in
unveiling
the
hidden
treasure
that
the
buccaneers
buried
on
the
lonely
shore
he
has
ventured
successfully
into
the
dim
region
of
surmises
and
when
he
loses
there
are
always
consolations
the
indies
have
not
been
discovered
on
this
voyage
certainly
but
there
have
been
wonders
on
the
way
he
has
enjoyed
many
hours
of
delicious
expectation
the
proof
that
he
likes
the
sport
even
when
he
loses
is
that
he
invariably
takes
the
first
opportunity
of
venturing
again
in
the
same
manner
and
by
the
way
perhaps
i
was
a
little
severe
just
now
on
trade
and
especially
on
the
grocer
sugary
and
soapy
enterprise
perhaps
if
we
were
to
look
with
a
rather
finer
vision
into
the
commercial
spirit
we
might
find
that
it
is
not
wholly
commercial
not
altogether
sordid
of
course
if
the
grocer
opens
his
shop
with
a
certainty
mathematical
or
almost
mathematical
that
the
public
will
buy
his
wares
he
is
a
wicked
fellow
he
is
gambling
with
loaded
dice
betting
against
a
horse
that
he
knows
is
to
be
made
all
right
playing
cards
with
honours
up
his
sleeve
and
i
am
sure
that
if
this
be
his
enterprise
it
will
always
meet
with
our
sternest
disapproval
casanova
died
towards
the
close
of
the
last
century
and
since
then
cardsharping
has
become
impossible
to
a
man
of
taste
but
seriously
i
suspect
that
a
good
deal
of
the
allurement
that
trade
possesses
for
so
many
of
us
is
the
risk
which
it
almost
always
implies
and
risk
means
uncertainty
and
uncertainty
connotes
the
unknown
so
you
see
our
despised
grocer
turns
out
after
all
to
be
of
the
kin
of
columbus
of
the
and
and
delvers
after
hidden
things
spiritual
and
material
i
suppose
we
have
here
the
real
explanation
of
the
human
trading
passion
and
the
solution
of
a
problem
that
has
often
puzzled
me
the
problem
i
mean
is
this
how
does
it
happen
that
the
english
are
both
the
greatest
poets
and
the
greatest
tradesmen
of
the
modern
world
superficially
it
seems
that
keeping
shops
and
making
poetry
are
incompatibles
and
wordsworth
and
coleridge
keats
and
shelley
tennyson
and
poe
should
have
come
from
provence
or
sicily
from
the
unpractical
uncommercial
latin
races
but
if
we
trace
back
the
trading
instinct
to
that
love
of
a
risk
or
in
other
words
to
the
desire
for
the
unknown
the
antinomy
disappears
and
it
will
become
perfectly
natural
that
the
race
which
has
gone
to
the
world
end
with
its
merchandise
has
penetrated
so
gloriously
into
the
further
regions
of
poetry
but
that
reminds
me
of
what
i
was
saying
just
after
you
had
lit
your
pipe
i
think
i
remarked
that
i
had
seen
something
of
very
high
significance
in
the
evening
paper
and
the
glare
of
disgust
with
which
you
greeted
my
observation
constituted
an
interruption
and
an
interruption
that
had
to
be
dealt
with
now
again
you
seem
to
hint
at
doubt
with
your
eyebrows
you
would
say
perhaps
that
i
have
not
made
out
a
very
convincing
case
for
journalism
but
you
must
remember
that
my
mental
process
resembles
that
of
coleridge
you
called
on
the
seer
at
eleven
in
the
morning
and
if
young
and
imprudent
asked
him
a
question
and
at
the
waning
of
the
light
coleridge
was
still
diligently
engaged
in
answering
your
question
for
you
having
talked
without
intermission
all
the
summer
day
a
cyclical
mode
of
discoursing
the
pious
henry
nelson
coleridge
called
it
and
he
deals
faithfully
with
certain
persons
who
complained
that
they
could
get
no
answer
to
a
question
from
coleridge
and
you
will
please
to
remember
this
when
you
think
that
i
am
wandering
a
vice
of
which
coleridge
also
was
accused
for
example
on
the
evening
paper
being
mentioned
your
face
expressed
disgust
and
contempt
which
i
diagnosed
and
rightly
i
believe
as
a
tribute
to
the
enormous
interest
taken
by
the
editors
of
these
agreeable
journals
in
the
very
latest
sporting
news
an
interest
which
allows
but
little
space
for
the
discussion
of
pure
literature
hence
my
remarks
on
the
and
now
i
hope
you
will
at
least
assume
a
thrill
of
interest
when
the
boy
bawls
in
your
ear
all
the
winners
and
it
is
possible
you
may
be
thinking
of
ulysses
or
of
keats
at
the
moment
and
the
interruption
may
annoy
you
but
it
will
do
so
no
longer
when
you
reflect
that
a
burning
anxiety
as
to
the
running
of
bolter
is
for
many
thousands
the
symbol
and
the
only
possible
symbol
of
the
doom
of
troy
and
the
wandering
fields
of
foam
and
the
isle
of
calypso
and
the
strange
surmise
of
pizarro
and
all
his
men
but
here
is
the
in
question
yes
the
colour
is
perhaps
a
little
sickly
a
kind
of
it
seems
does
it
but
it
forced
itself
on
my
notice
in
the
most
extraordinary
manner
and
i
expect
you
will
have
to
admit
when
you
have
heard
the
story
that
some
powers
were
at
work
well
i
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
just
as
it
was
getting
dusk
and
every
now
and
then
i
stopped
and
looked
out
of
the
window
yes
i
was
making
phrases
as
usual
and
thinking
of
a
new
story
in
the
middle
of
the
old
one
hence
the
exercise
i
daresay
you
have
remarked
that
i
do
not
keep
my
window
in
a
very
brilliant
condition
and
the
air
this
evening
you
will
remember
was
rather
misty
october
i
always
think
wears
a
peculiar
dim
grace
in
barnsbury
so
i
hope
you
will
not
find
my
impressions
too
incredible
i
was
staring
then
out
of
the
window
when
to
my
vast
astonishment
a
great
pale
bird
seemed
suddenly
to
shoot
up
into
the
air
from
the
road
and
to
flutter
into
the
garden
where
it
became
entangled
in
that
sapless
old
laburnum
that
weeps
green
tears
upon
the
wall
i
saw
as
i
thought
the
beating
and
fluttering
of
wings
and
i
ran
out
imagining
that
i
was
to
secure
a
strange
companion
for
my
solitude
it
was
the
evening
paper
not
a
bird
and
i
saw
at
once
that
it
would
be
impious
to
let
it
flutter
there
unread
so
i
secured
it
and
brought
it
in
meditating
the
adventure
and
wondering
what
strange
message
was
thus
borne
to
my
eyes
so
i
went
through
its
columns
patiently
even
to
the
leaderettes
and
i
will
do
myself
the
justice
to
say
that
i
at
once
recognised
the
communication
that
was
addressed
to
me
in
this
singular
and
even
i
may
say
arabian
fashion
it
was
a
short
comment
upon
some
agitation
that
is
now
appealing
rather
strongly
to
progressive
leaders
but
the
is
of
no
consequence
since
the
significance
lies
in
the
last
sentence
here
it
is
we
are
glad
to
hear
that
extensive
arrangements
have
been
made
for
the
dissemination
of
literature
you
do
see
the
immense
importance
of
that
you
surprise
me
let
us
go
into
it
then
i
told
you
i
was
not
very
precise
as
to
the
exact
scope
of
the
agitation
alluded
to
it
may
be
a
question
of
a
heavy
tax
on
persons
who
will
say
lady
instead
of
lydy
it
may
be
an
affair
of
restricting
the
franchise
to
citizens
thoroughly
ignorant
of
history
it
does
matter
but
here
are
men
who
wish
some
political
change
to
be
effected
and
these
men
are
issuing
printed
matter
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
convince
others
of
the
righteousness
of
this
particular
program
and
this
printed
matter
is
called
literature
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
indicated
it
may
be
a
series
of
arguments
simple
and
fallacious
it
may
be
in
dialogue
it
may
be
in
story
form
it
may
assume
the
guise
of
parody
it
may
be
a
brief
history
and
now
what
i
want
to
know
is
this
here
we
have
a
vast
body
of
thought
clothed
in
words
ranging
from
the
agreeable
leaflets
that
we
have
been
speaking
of
up
to
let
us
say
the
odyssey
and
all
this
mass
is
known
as
literature
what
is
to
be
our
criterion
our
means
of
distinguishing
between
the
two
extremes
i
have
mentioned
and
all
the
innumerable
links
between
them
is
the
whole
mass
literature
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
if
not
with
what
instrument
by
what
rule
are
we
to
divide
the
true
from
the
false
to
judge
exactly
in
the
case
of
any
particular
book
whether
it
is
literature
or
not
of
course
you
may
say
that
the
question
is
rather
verbal
than
real
that
literature
is
a
general
term
conveniently
applied
to
anything
in
print
and
that
in
practice
everybody
knows
the
difference
between
a
political
pamphlet
and
the
odyssey
i
very
much
doubt
whether
people
do
understand
precisely
the
distinction
between
the
two
but
for
the
avoidance
of
verbal
confusion
i
suggest
that
when
we
mean
literature
in
its
highest
sense
we
shall
say
for
the
present
at
all
events
fine
literature
and
the
question
will
be
then
what
is
it
that
differentiates
fine
literature
from
a
number
of
grammatical
or
partly
grammatical
sentences
arranged
in
a
more
or
less
logical
order
why
is
the
odyssey
to
come
in
why
is
the
literature
of
our
evening
paper
to
be
kept
out
and
again
to
put
the
question
in
a
more
subtle
form
to
which
class
do
the
works
of
jane
austen
belong
is
pride
and
prejudice
to
stand
on
the
odyssey
shelf
or
to
lie
in
the
pamphlet
drawer
where
is
pope
place
is
he
to
be
set
in
the
class
of
keats
if
not
for
what
reason
what
is
the
rank
of
dickens
of
thackeray
of
george
eliot
of
hawthorne
and
in
a
word
how
are
we
to
sort
out
as
it
were
this
huge
multitude
of
names
giving
to
each
one
his
proper
rank
and
station
i
am
glad
it
strikes
you
as
a
big
question
to
me
it
seems
question
the
question
which
covers
the
final
dogma
of
literary
criticism
of
course
after
we
have
answered
this
prerogative
riddle
there
will
be
other
questions
almost
without
end
classes
and
of
infinite
analysis
but
this
will
be
detail
while
the
question
i
have
propounded
is
the
question
of
first
principles
it
marks
the
parting
of
two
ways
and
in
a
manner
it
asks
itself
not
only
of
literature
but
of
life
but
of
philosophy
but
of
religion
what
is
the
line
then
the
mark
of
division
which
is
to
separate
spoken
or
written
or
printed
thought
into
two
great
genera
well
as
you
may
have
guessed
i
have
my
solution
and
i
like
it
none
the
less
because
the
word
of
the
enigma
seems
to
me
actually
but
a
single
word
yes
for
me
the
answer
comes
with
the
one
word
if
ecstasy
be
present
then
i
say
there
is
fine
literature
if
it
be
absent
then
in
spite
of
all
the
cleverness
all
the
talents
all
the
workmanship
and
observation
and
dexterity
you
may
show
me
then
i
think
we
have
a
product
possibly
a
very
interesting
one
which
is
not
fine
literature
of
course
you
will
allow
me
to
contradict
myself
or
rather
to
amplify
myself
before
we
begin
to
discuss
the
matter
fully
i
said
my
answer
was
the
word
ecstasy
i
still
say
so
but
i
may
remark
that
i
have
chosen
this
word
as
the
representative
of
many
substitute
if
you
like
rapture
beauty
adoration
wonder
awe
mystery
sense
of
the
unknown
desire
for
the
unknown
all
and
each
will
convey
what
i
mean
for
some
particular
case
one
term
may
be
more
appropriate
than
another
but
in
every
case
there
will
be
that
withdrawal
from
the
common
life
and
the
common
consciousness
which
justifies
my
choice
of
ecstasy
as
the
best
symbol
of
my
meaning
i
claim
then
that
here
we
have
the
touchstone
which
will
infallibly
separate
the
higher
from
the
lower
in
literature
which
will
range
the
innumerable
multitude
of
books
in
two
great
divisions
which
can
be
applied
with
equal
justice
to
a
greek
drama
an
eighteenth
century
novelist
and
a
modern
poet
to
an
epic
in
twelve
books
and
to
a
lyric
in
twelve
lines
i
will
convince
you
of
my
belief
in
my
own
nostrum
by
a
bold
experiment
here
is
and
here
is
the
one
regarded
as
a
popular
comic
book
the
other
as
a
serious
masterpiece
showing
vast
insight
into
human
character
and
applying
my
test
i
set
beside
the
odyssey
and
on
top
of
the
political
pamphlet
i
will
not
argue
the
matter
at
the
moment
i
would
merely
caution
you
against
supposing
that
i
imply
any
equality
of
merit
in
the
books
that
i
have
thus
summarily
bracketed
you
must
suppose
that
i
think
dickens
book
as
good
as
homer
or
that
i
have
any
doubts
as
to
the
vast
superiority
of
over
all
the
pamphlets
in
the
world
here
is
a
temple
here
is
a
tub
we
may
suppose
a
child
to
say
learning
from
a
but
the
temple
may
be
a
miserably
designed
structure
in
ruinous
condition
and
the
tub
is
perhaps
a
miracle
of
excellent
workmanship
but
one
means
worship
and
the
other
means
washing
and
that
is
distinction
or
to
take
a
better
example
the
bottom
boy
in
the
sixth
form
may
be
a
miserable
dunce
compared
with
the
top
boy
in
the
fifth
still
the
dunce
is
in
the
sixth
form
and
the
genius
is
in
the
fifth
or
to
take
a
third
instance
i
want
you
to
understand
what
i
driving
at
the
fact
that
an
english
orator
is
fluent
brilliant
profound
convincing
while
a
greek
orator
is
stuttering
stupid
shallow
illogical
does
not
hinder
that
the
former
though
he
may
speak
ever
so
well
still
speaks
english
while
the
latter
however
badly
he
may
speak
speaks
in
greek
for
all
that
analogies
as
you
know
are
never
perfect
and
must
not
be
pressed
too
far
they
suggest
rather
than
prove
but
i
hope
you
understand
me
though
you
may
not
agree
with
me
but
before
we
argue
the
merits
of
my
own
literary
solvent
we
might
very
well
see
what
we
can
do
with
other
tests
i
daresay
you
can
suggest
a
good
many
we
wo
go
into
the
question
of
printed
and
not
printed
written
or
not
written
because
it
is
obvious
that
the
visible
symbols
by
which
literature
is
recorded
have
nothing
to
do
with
literature
itself
in
the
beginning
all
literature
was
a
matter
of
improvisation
or
recitation
and
memory
and
hieroglyphics
writing
printing
are
mere
conveniences
indeed
the
point
is
only
worth
mentioning
because
there
are
i
believe
simple
souls
who
think
that
the
invention
of
printing
has
some
sort
of
mysterious
connection
with
the
birth
of
literature
and
that
the
abolition
of
the
paper
duty
was
its
coming
of
age
but
i
think
we
need
trouble
ourselves
much
about
a
view
of
literary
art
which
regards
the
cheap
press
as
its
father
and
the
school
board
as
its
nursing
mother
many
people
think
on
the
other
hand
that
literature
is
to
be
estimated
by
its
effect
on
the
emotions
by
the
shock
which
it
gives
to
the
system
you
may
say
that
a
book
which
interests
you
so
intensely
that
you
can
not
put
it
down
that
affects
you
so
acutely
that
you
weep
that
amuses
you
so
immensely
that
you
roar
with
laughter
must
be
very
good
i
do
object
to
very
good
but
from
my
point
of
view
very
good
and
fine
literature
are
two
different
things
you
see
i
believe
that
the
difference
between
interesting
exciting
reading
matter
and
fine
art
is
not
specific
but
generic
who
would
blaspheme
against
good
bitter
beer
who
would
say
that
it
is
good
it
is
burgundy
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
i
am
not
muddling
up
two
things
which
are
in
reality
distinct
i
mean
i
am
in
doubt
whether
the
faculty
of
making
the
reader
cry
ought
not
to
be
distinguished
from
the
faculty
of
interesting
him
intensely
on
the
whole
i
think
that
it
would
be
well
to
draw
a
line
between
the
two
especially
as
interesting
is
somewhat
ambiguous
and
you
think
it
a
paradox
then
to
maintain
that
the
power
of
exciting
the
emotions
to
a
high
degree
is
not
a
mark
of
fine
literature
but
just
think
it
over
suppose
that
a
few
yards
from
this
room
in
the
next
house
in
the
next
street
a
woman
is
waiting
for
the
return
of
her
husband
and
son
a
ring
comes
at
the
bell
there
a
envelope
and
inside
it
the
message
railway
accident
father
killed
well
you
can
imagine
the
effect
that
these
four
words
will
have
on
the
woman
emotions
she
will
either
faint
away
or
burst
into
an
agony
of
tears
she
may
even
die
of
the
shock
and
you
ca
have
a
more
striking
emotional
result
than
death
can
you
very
well
but
is
the
telegram
fine
art
is
it
art
is
it
even
artifice
it
is
art
because
it
is
true
but
if
i
invented
such
a
telegram
and
sent
it
to
a
woman
whose
husband
and
son
were
away
would
it
thereby
become
art
you
must
see
perfectly
well
that
it
would
be
nothing
of
the
kind
and
i
must
ask
you
to
explain
how
a
book
which
is
virtually
a
long
succession
of
such
telegrams
can
rise
higher
than
its
origin
and
source
you
must
see
i
think
that
the
question
of
truth
and
falsity
can
make
no
real
difference
to
our
no
doubt
pompous
high
æsthetic
standpoint
and
if
you
admit
that
four
words
which
produce
an
emotional
result
are
not
necessarily
art
then
it
follows
that
four
hundred
or
four
hundred
thousand
words
woven
together
on
the
same
principle
are
in
no
better
position
an
increased
quantity
means
no
doubt
an
increased
artifice
but
artifice
and
art
are
very
different
things
we
may
agree
then
that
it
is
impossible
to
measure
the
artistic
merit
of
a
book
by
the
emotional
shock
that
it
may
give
to
its
readers
i
have
never
read
the
sorrows
of
werther
but
if
you
have
read
it
and
it
has
made
you
sorrowful
you
are
hereby
warned
against
deducing
from
this
effect
any
conclusion
as
to
its
æsthetic
value
i
confess
all
this
seems
a
b
c
to
me
though
i
see
you
are
still
inclined
to
think
me
a
little
paradoxical
not
to
say
sophistical
but
it
grows
more
difficult
when
one
gets
to
the
question
of
the
interesting
or
absorbing
book
as
i
said
interesting
seems
such
an
ambiguous
word
it
may
stand
for
that
æsthetic
emotion
produced
say
by
the
œdipus
it
may
denote
the
attention
of
the
butcher
wife
listening
to
the
story
of
my
landlady
as
to
the
of
the
grocer
daughter
and
there
are
many
books
which
are
virtually
tales
of
my
landlady
printed
and
bound
we
must
really
then
omit
interesting
in
our
account
of
the
possible
criteria
of
fine
art
the
word
as
it
were
cancels
itself
out
because
it
may
mean
on
the
one
hand
the
possession
of
the
highest
artistic
value
or
on
the
other
it
may
serve
as
epithet
for
a
book
which
gratifies
the
lowest
curiosity
you
know
there
are
books
which
the
french
have
kindly
named
romans
à
clef
and
i
suppose
there
is
no
more
miserable
form
of
the
receipt
is
easy
enough
the
grocer
daughter
to
whose
amours
i
alluded
just
now
is
really
named
miss
buggins
and
the
gentleman
is
mr
tibb
well
suppose
that
my
landlady
relating
their
lyric
to
the
wife
should
with
a
knowing
wink
profess
to
tell
the
story
of
miss
ruggins
and
mr
ribb
she
would
simply
be
composing
a
à
without
knowing
it
you
might
say
that
it
is
hardly
worth
while
to
labour
the
point
that
such
interest
as
this
is
wholly
and
lamentably
inartistic
that
it
is
the
very
contrary
to
all
true
art
but
it
is
not
long
since
a
person
of
some
literary
note
in
criticising
the
heptameron
stated
that
its
chief
value
lay
in
the
fact
that
one
could
identify
the
persons
who
tell
the
stories
and
those
also
of
whom
they
were
told
but
there
is
another
interest
of
a
much
higher
kind
and
that
is
the
sensational
we
have
done
some
excellent
books
of
this
sort
in
england
and
perhaps
you
will
understand
the
class
i
mean
when
i
say
that
a
novel
of
this
description
is
hard
to
lay
down
and
harder
still
to
take
up
again
when
you
have
once
found
out
the
secret
this
is
not
high
art
you
are
always
at
liberty
to
put
down
lycidas
but
then
you
are
compelled
to
take
it
up
again
and
again
and
the
secret
of
lycidas
is
always
a
secret
and
one
never
fails
to
experience
the
joy
of
an
artistic
surprise
still
the
books
i
mean
sometimes
show
very
high
artifice
and
in
itself
perhaps
the
quality
that
i
am
talking
about
the
power
of
exciting
a
vivid
curiosity
an
earnest
desire
to
know
what
is
to
come
next
is
not
like
the
vulgar
à
curiosity
in
actual
disaccord
from
the
purpose
of
art
indeed
i
imagine
that
this
trick
of
stimulating
the
curiosity
may
be
made
subservient
to
purely
æsthetic
ends
it
may
become
a
handmaid
to
lead
one
towards
that
desire
of
the
unknown
which
i
think
was
one
of
the
synonyms
i
gave
you
for
the
master
word
ecstasy
still
though
the
trick
is
a
good
one
it
will
not
by
itself
make
fine
art
you
may
discover
so
much
by
reading
the
moonstone
that
monument
of
ingenuity
and
absurdity
on
the
face
of
it
all
detective
stories
come
under
this
heading
formally
no
doubt
they
must
all
be
reckoned
as
tricks
and
they
may
vary
from
the
infinitely
ingenious
to
the
infinitely
imbecile
and
so
far
as
i
remember
the
famous
french
tales
of
detection
verge
towards
the
lower
rather
than
the
higher
ground
but
i
am
inclined
not
very
logically
perhaps
to
make
an
exception
in
favour
of
poe
dupin
and
to
place
him
almost
in
the
sphere
of
pure
literature
logically
he
is
a
detective
but
i
almost
think
that
in
his
case
the
detective
is
a
symbol
of
the
mystagogue
as
i
say
i
should
be
pressed
hard
if
i
were
asked
to
make
out
my
case
in
terms
and
syllogisms
but
if
you
require
me
to
do
so
i
would
say
first
of
all
that
the
atmosphere
of
dupin
and
you
must
remember
that
in
literature
everything
counts
it
is
not
alone
the
plot
or
the
style
that
we
have
to
consider
has
to
me
hints
of
that
presence
which
i
have
called
ecstasy
listen
to
this
it
was
a
freak
of
fancy
in
my
friend
for
what
else
shall
i
call
it
to
be
enamoured
of
the
night
for
her
own
sake
and
into
this
as
into
all
his
others
i
quietly
fell
giving
myself
up
to
his
wild
whims
with
a
perfect
the
sable
divinity
would
not
herself
dwell
with
us
always
but
we
could
counterfeit
her
presence
at
the
first
dawn
of
the
morning
we
closed
all
the
massive
shutters
of
our
old
building
lighting
a
couple
of
tapers
which
strongly
perfumed
threw
out
only
the
ghastliest
and
feeblest
of
rays
by
the
aid
of
these
we
then
buried
our
souls
in
dreams
reading
writing
or
conversing
until
warned
by
the
clock
of
the
advent
of
the
true
darkness
then
we
sallied
forth
into
the
streets
arm
in
arm
continuing
the
topics
of
the
day
or
roaming
far
and
wide
until
a
late
hour
seeking
amid
the
wild
lights
and
shadows
of
the
populous
city
that
infinity
of
mental
excitement
which
quiet
observation
can
afford
and
again
in
the
stories
themselves
in
the
conduct
of
detective
processes
i
find
a
faint
suggestion
of
the
or
other
consciousness
of
man
a
mere
hint
not
i
think
expressed
in
so
many
words
rather
latent
than
patent
that
if
you
would
thoroughly
understand
the
rational
man
you
must
have
sounded
the
irrational
man
the
mysterious
companion
that
walks
beside
each
one
of
us
on
the
earthly
journey
of
course
the
artifice
in
the
dupin
stories
is
of
the
very
highest
kind
but
for
the
reasons
i
have
given
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
there
is
more
than
artifice
and
the
shadow
at
all
events
of
art
itself
but
this
exceptional
case
of
poe
detective
tales
only
leads
us
back
to
the
main
proposition
that
the
power
of
exciting
a
very
high
sensational
interest
does
not
in
itself
mark
out
a
book
as
being
fine
literature
i
think
i
proved
the
proposition
by
my
instance
of
the
moonstone
but
if
that
does
not
convince
you
we
might
demonstrate
this
theorem
in
the
same
way
as
we
demonstrated
the
other
one
about
the
literature
that
produces
its
effect
on
the
emotions
we
have
only
to
send
out
a
series
of
telegrams
or
we
may
even
glance
at
the
newspaper
and
follow
a
case
in
the
central
criminal
court
or
we
may
affirm
more
generally
that
life
often
offers
many
highly
absorbing
and
highly
interesting
spectacles
but
that
life
is
not
art
and
therefore
that
literature
which
fails
to
rise
above
the
level
of
life
or
rather
to
penetrate
beneath
the
surface
of
life
is
not
fine
literature
in
our
sense
of
that
term
a
gold
nugget
may
be
as
pure
and
fine
as
you
like
but
it
is
not
a
sovereign
it
lacks
the
stamp
and
it
is
the
business
of
art
to
give
its
stamp
and
imprint
to
the
matter
of
life
i
really
think
then
that
we
have
disposed
of
perhaps
the
most
generally
received
of
artistic
fallacies
that
books
are
to
be
judged
by
their
power
of
reproducing
in
the
reader
those
feelings
of
grief
interest
curiosity
and
so
forth
which
he
experiences
or
may
experience
in
his
everyday
life
which
he
really
does
experience
in
greater
or
less
degree
every
time
he
talks
to
a
friend
takes
up
a
newspaper
or
receives
a
telegram
it
comes
to
this
again
and
again
does
it
that
art
and
life
are
two
different
spheres
and
that
the
artist
with
a
capital
a
is
not
a
clever
photographer
who
understands
selection
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
but
before
we
go
on
with
our
work
and
see
what
can
be
done
with
other
literary
solvents
i
want
to
make
a
digression
i
should
have
made
it
before
if
you
had
pulled
me
up
at
the
proper
cue
and
that
was
when
i
spoke
of
interest
as
a
highly
ambiguous
term
the
fruitful
parent
of
undistributed
middles
you
see
how
the
unscrupulous
sophist
would
bend
this
word
to
his
dark
work
do
you
it
would
be
i
suppose
something
like
this
a
very
high
degree
of
interest
of
the
artistic
kind
is
the
mark
of
fine
literature
but
the
moonstone
excites
a
very
high
degree
of
interest
of
the
sensational
kind
the
moonstone
has
the
mark
of
fine
literature
you
note
the
paltering
with
the
word
its
use
now
in
one
sense
and
now
in
another
and
if
that
sort
of
thing
were
allowed
we
should
have
wilkie
collins
placed
among
the
immortals
before
we
knew
where
we
were
but
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
nearly
all
the
terms
we
are
using
are
patient
of
the
same
vile
uses
you
remember
that
we
began
with
literature
itself
as
a
monstrous
example
of
ambiguity
sheltering
as
it
did
both
the
publications
of
the
society
and
the
song
of
ulysses
wandering
even
now
we
are
trying
to
track
the
monster
to
his
den
in
spite
of
his
manifold
turnings
and
disguises
in
the
meanwhile
for
the
sake
of
clearness
we
agreed
to
prefix
the
epithet
fine
to
the
word
when
we
meant
the
odyssey
class
though
if
we
say
fine
so
often
i
am
afraid
we
run
the
risk
of
being
thought
superfine
however
one
must
run
all
risks
in
the
cause
of
making
oneself
understood
and
so
i
say
you
ought
to
have
pulled
me
up
when
i
talked
about
art
and
books
that
appealed
to
the
emotions
my
art
may
not
be
the
same
as
your
art
and
emotions
are
still
more
dangerous
in
the
same
way
i
think
i
made
some
attempt
to
deal
with
art
as
i
was
talking
i
contrasted
it
with
artifice
and
my
phrase
artist
with
a
big
a
was
another
hint
to
you
that
the
word
must
be
handled
cautiously
you
know
that
in
ordinary
conversation
we
say
that
bees
have
the
art
or
an
art
of
making
hexagonal
cells
of
wax
that
wasps
have
an
art
of
making
a
sort
of
paper
for
their
nests
that
there
is
an
art
of
logic
an
art
of
cookery
an
art
in
making
a
gravel
path
now
in
each
of
these
instances
the
word
really
speaks
of
the
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
in
the
case
of
the
bees
and
wasps
there
is
a
slightly
different
of
meaning
because
they
make
their
cells
and
their
paper
just
as
a
bird
builds
its
nest
through
the
influence
of
forces
which
to
us
are
occult
which
we
conveniently
sum
up
under
the
word
instinct
in
the
arts
of
cookery
and
pathmaking
there
is
a
conscious
employment
of
certain
means
towards
the
securing
of
certain
ends
and
it
is
at
least
possible
that
the
swallow
gathering
its
materials
and
shaping
them
has
at
the
moment
nothing
but
a
blind
impulse
similar
to
that
of
hunger
we
all
know
when
we
are
hungry
and
we
all
know
what
to
do
in
such
a
case
but
we
do
not
all
know
the
physiology
of
the
stomach
and
the
gastric
juices
and
perhaps
not
one
of
us
knows
the
whole
secret
of
inanition
and
nutrition
we
simply
eat
because
we
want
to
eat
not
because
we
wish
to
supply
ourselves
with
a
certain
quantity
of
peptones
and
so
perhaps
the
swallow
gathers
her
nest
and
shapes
it
without
the
consciousness
of
the
eggs
and
the
little
birds
that
are
to
follow
but
i
need
not
remind
you
that
there
are
plenty
of
well
authenticated
instances
of
animals
who
have
consciously
used
means
to
secure
ends
and
thus
art
in
its
common
significance
is
not
even
an
exclusively
human
faculty
when
for
example
the
bees
find
themselves
in
danger
of
being
left
queenless
they
administer
what
has
been
called
royal
food
to
a
common
grub
and
that
which
would
have
been
a
worker
becomes
a
queen
and
in
this
case
the
bees
are
as
much
artists
as
the
cook
who
puts
a
particular
ingredient
into
a
dish
with
the
view
of
obtaining
a
particular
flavour
now
then
let
us
apply
all
this
to
our
matter
i
daresay
you
have
often
heard
a
book
praised
for
its
great
art
and
if
you
have
read
it
you
will
have
discovered
that
its
art
is
simply
contrivance
the
very
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
that
we
have
been
discussing
the
art
with
which
the
mystery
is
carefully
kept
in
the
background
the
art
by
which
the
two
characters
are
contrasted
throughout
the
volume
the
highly
artistic
manner
in
which
fernando
and
the
heroine
are
brought
together
on
the
last
page
these
you
see
clearly
are
contrivances
artifices
in
no
way
differing
in
degree
from
the
contrivances
of
the
man
who
makes
the
garden
path
of
the
cook
who
dusts
in
just
a
suspicion
of
of
the
bee
who
administers
the
royal
food
this
art
then
is
a
totally
different
thing
from
our
art
with
the
capital
letter
with
the
epithet
fine
or
high
before
it
and
in
future
when
i
mean
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
i
shall
always
say
artifice
while
art
will
be
retained
and
set
apart
for
higher
uses
and
now
as
to
emotion
here
i
think
you
ought
to
have
been
down
on
me
you
might
have
said
you
declare
that
the
appeal
to
the
emotions
is
not
a
test
of
fine
literature
but
to
what
then
does
homer
appeal
what
is
the
œdipus
but
an
appeal
to
the
emotions
what
is
all
exquisite
lyric
poetry
but
the
cry
of
the
emotions
set
to
music
i
suppose
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
understood
my
real
meaning
by
the
instance
i
gave
the
anguish
of
a
wife
at
the
loss
of
a
husband
you
saw
that
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
this
that
fine
literature
does
not
content
itself
with
repeating
or
mimicking
the
emotions
of
private
personal
everyday
life
still
i
should
have
gone
into
the
matter
more
fully
then
and
as
i
did
not
do
so
we
had
better
see
what
can
be
done
now
and
do
you
know
that
i
believe
that
the
best
approach
we
can
make
to
a
rather
subtle
question
will
be
a
somewhat
indirect
one
just
now
i
was
talking
about
poe
dupin
stories
and
i
tried
rather
vaguely
to
justify
my
tentative
inclusion
of
them
in
the
higher
class
of
letters
by
pointing
out
that
poe
seemed
to
hint
at
the
of
man
and
to
suggest
at
least
the
presence
of
that
shadowy
unknown
or
companion
who
walks
beside
each
one
of
us
all
our
days
i
tried
to
realise
the
image
of
a
man
followed
or
rather
attended
by
a
spiritual
fellow
treading
a
path
parallel
with
but
different
from
his
own
and
now
i
want
you
to
carry
out
this
image
into
the
sphere
of
words
already
you
must
have
a
hint
of
it
one
might
draw
a
figure
something
like
this
fine
literature
literature
art
artifice
emotion
feelings
and
before
i
go
into
the
special
question
let
me
extend
the
list
it
will
explain
itself
romance
romantic
a
romantic
affair
in
the
west
end
tragedy
tragic
tragedy
in
soho
drama
dramatic
le
drame
de
la
rue
cochon
dramatic
elopement
in
peckham
interest
interesting
an
interesting
number
of
snippets
of
hamlet
lyric
the
lyric
theatre
inebriated
in
an
inebriated
condition
that
almost
gives
my
secret
away
does
it
of
course
you
see
the
place
that
the
words
in
the
column
take
in
the
scheme
the
romantic
affair
in
the
west
end
really
concerned
the
life
of
a
draper
assistant
who
robbed
his
master
till
in
order
that
he
might
make
presents
to
miss
claire
tilbury
one
of
the
sisters
tilbury
now
performing
at
the
lucifer
an
unmentionable
person
cut
his
throat
in
some
alley
off
greek
street
hence
the
tragedy
in
soho
two
peculiarly
squalid
servants
who
beat
out
their
master
brains
under
singularly
uninteresting
circumstances
acted
the
drama
of
the
rue
cochon
and
it
was
a
dissolute
barmaid
who
eloped
dramatically
from
peckham
in
the
of
her
employer
the
two
varying
uses
of
the
word
lyric
need
not
be
underlined
for
you
who
know
the
elizabethans
and
the
cavaliers
but
perhaps
i
may
say
that
he
who
tastes
meus
will
not
be
in
an
inebriated
condition
it
would
be
possible
to
extend
these
parallel
columns
almost
to
infinity
but
i
think
the
list
is
long
enough
for
our
purpose
and
trench
on
words
is
a
handbook
but
you
see
my
column
word
parallel
with
emotion
you
see
i
have
written
feelings
and
i
suggest
that
it
will
be
convenient
to
speak
of
feelings
when
we
mean
the
things
of
life
of
society
of
personal
and
private
relationship
while
we
may
reserve
emotion
for
the
influence
produced
in
man
by
fine
art
thus
it
will
be
with
emotion
that
we
witness
the
fall
of
œdipus
the
madness
of
lear
while
we
feel
for
our
friends
and
ourselves
in
misfortune
that
seems
to
make
it
plain
enough
does
it
you
see
now
clearly
what
i
mean
by
saying
that
the
power
of
producing
an
emotional
shock
can
not
be
a
test
of
fine
literature
art
must
appeal
to
emotion
and
sometimes
no
doubt
with
a
shock
but
it
must
always
be
to
the
emotion
of
the
column
never
to
the
feelings
on
the
right
hand
so
you
must
never
tell
me
that
a
book
is
fine
art
because
it
made
you
or
somebody
else
cry
your
tears
are
emphatically
not
evidence
in
the
court
of
fine
literature
i
daresay
it
may
have
struck
you
that
the
tests
we
have
considered
hitherto
have
been
in
the
main
popular
tests
no
doubt
many
persons
calling
themselves
critics
have
praised
the
art
of
a
book
because
it
has
drawn
tears
from
eyes
or
because
it
has
not
suffered
itself
to
be
put
down
or
because
it
contains
easily
recognisable
portraits
of
people
but
such
critics
are
to
be
spelt
with
a
very
small
initial
letter
and
as
i
said
i
do
think
we
want
to
extend
that
list
of
parallels
there
is
another
test
that
i
had
forgotten
i
suppose
there
really
are
people
who
believe
that
a
book
is
fine
because
it
will
do
good
but
i
do
think
we
argue
with
them
though
i
once
knew
a
man
who
said
a
certain
book
was
fine
because
it
tended
to
raise
one
opinion
of
the
clergy
so
we
will
reckon
our
popular
tests
as
done
with
and
proceed
to
the
more
technical
solvents
that
are
proposed
by
professed
men
of
letters
three
of
these
more
literary
criteria
occur
to
me
at
the
moment
and
i
believe
we
shall
understand
them
and
the
position
which
they
represent
better
if
we
take
them
at
first
at
all
events
in
a
mass
i
can
conceive
then
that
many
persons
whose
opinion
one
would
respect
would
state
their
position
in
literary
criticism
somewhat
as
follows
if
a
book
they
would
say
shows
keenness
of
observation
insight
into
character
with
fidelity
to
life
as
the
result
of
these
capacities
if
its
art
we
should
say
artifice
in
the
design
and
out
of
the
plot
in
the
contrivance
of
incident
is
confessedly
admirable
and
finally
if
it
is
written
in
a
good
style
then
you
have
fine
literature
fine
art
in
short
is
a
clear
mirror
and
the
artist
skill
consists
in
arranging
and
selecting
such
parts
of
life
as
he
thinks
best
for
his
purpose
of
reflection
well
now
as
to
the
first
point
fidelity
to
life
clearness
of
reflection
the
selection
being
taken
for
granted
as
no
one
out
of
an
asylum
would
maintain
that
a
book
must
mirror
the
whole
of
life
or
even
the
millionth
part
of
one
particular
man
life
come
let
us
apply
the
test
in
question
to
one
or
two
of
the
acknowledged
excellencies
to
the
odyssey
for
instance
to
the
morte
to
don
quixote
is
the
story
of
ulysses
in
any
accepted
sense
of
the
phrase
faithful
to
life
as
we
know
it
is
it
faithful
that
is
to
say
with
the
fidelity
of
jane
austen
of
thackeray
of
george
eliot
of
fielding
is
there
anything
in
our
experience
answering
to
the
episodes
of
the
calypso
isle
the
cyclops
cavern
the
descent
of
the
goddess
is
the
reflection
even
a
reflection
of
homer
own
experience
had
he
escaped
from
the
cave
under
the
belly
of
a
ram
had
he
been
in
the
world
of
giants
were
his
friends
in
the
habit
of
talking
in
hexameter
verse
we
may
go
on
of
course
but
is
it
worth
while
it
is
surely
hardly
necessary
to
demonstrate
the
fact
that
the
author
of
the
morte
had
never
seen
the
graal
that
such
a
character
as
don
quixote
never
existed
in
the
natural
order
of
things
we
might
have
gone
more
sharply
to
work
with
this
fidelity
test
we
might
have
said
that
poetry
being
admittedly
fine
literature
at
its
finest
and
admittedly
also
being
unfaithful
to
life
as
we
know
it
both
in
matter
and
manner
that
therefore
the
test
breaks
down
at
once
if
fine
literature
must
be
faithful
to
life
then
kubla
khan
is
not
fine
literature
which
i
think
we
may
say
is
highly
absurd
i
daresay
you
think
i
have
dealt
rather
crudely
in
a
somewhat
materialistic
spirit
with
this
criterion
of
fidelity
to
life
i
admit
the
charge
but
you
must
remember
that
i
am
dealing
with
very
bad
people
who
understand
nothing
but
materialism
and
when
these
people
tell
you
in
so
many
words
that
it
is
the
author
business
clearly
and
intelligently
to
present
the
life
the
common
social
life
around
him
then
believe
me
the
only
thing
to
be
done
is
to
throw
odyssey
and
œdipus
morte
kubla
khan
and
don
quixote
straight
in
their
faces
and
to
demonstrate
that
these
eternal
books
were
not
constructed
on
the
proposed
receipt
of
course
if
i
were
treating
with
the
initiated
if
i
were
commentating
and
not
arguing
i
should
handle
the
great
masterpieces
in
a
much
more
reverent
manner
i
mean
that
for
those
who
possess
the
secret
it
skills
not
to
bring
in
the
cyclops
who
for
us
is
not
a
giant
but
a
symbol
we
have
only
to
bow
down
before
the
great
music
of
such
a
poem
as
the
odyssey
recognising
that
by
the
very
reason
of
its
transcendent
beauty
by
the
very
fact
that
it
trespasses
far
beyond
the
world
of
our
daily
lives
beyond
selection
and
reflection
it
is
also
exalted
above
our
understanding
that
because
its
beauty
is
supreme
that
therefore
its
beauty
is
largely
beyond
criticism
for
ourselves
we
do
not
need
to
prove
its
transcendence
of
life
by
this
or
that
extraordinary
incident
it
is
the
whole
spirit
and
essence
and
sound
and
colour
of
the
song
that
affect
us
and
we
know
that
the
odyssey
surpassed
the
bounds
of
its
own
age
and
its
own
land
just
as
much
as
it
surpasses
those
of
our
time
and
our
country
you
look
as
if
you
thought
i
were
fighting
with
the
vanquished
but
let
me
tell
you
that
great
people
have
praised
homer
because
he
depicted
truthfully
the
men
and
manners
of
his
time
but
as
i
was
saying
all
this
would
be
too
subtle
for
the
enemy
for
the
people
who
maintain
that
fine
literature
is
a
faithful
reflection
of
life
and
think
that
jane
austen
touched
the
point
of
literary
supremacy
with
them
as
i
said
we
must
be
rough
we
must
ask
did
sophocles
describe
the
ordinary
life
of
athens
in
his
day
no
very
well
then
since
the
works
of
sophocles
are
fine
literature
it
follows
that
some
fine
literature
does
not
reflect
ordinary
life
and
therefore
that
fidelity
to
nature
is
not
the
differentia
of
the
highest
art
i
wonder
whether
i
ought
to
caution
you
again
against
the
ambiguity
of
language
we
are
dealing
easily
enough
with
such
words
as
life
and
nature
and
from
what
you
know
of
my
system
you
may
perhaps
have
seen
that
i
have
been
using
these
words
as
the
people
use
them
as
those
use
them
who
would
say
that
vanity
fair
is
a
faithful
presentation
of
life
i
thought
you
would
understand
this
but
i
may
just
mention
in
passing
that
words
like
nature
life
and
truth
or
fidelity
have
also
their
esoteric
values
that
by
way
of
example
the
truth
of
the
scientist
and
the
truth
of
the
philosopher
are
two
very
different
things
so
it
may
turn
out
by
and
bye
that
in
the
occult
sense
fidelity
to
life
the
differentia
of
fine
literature
that
the
aim
of
art
is
truth
that
the
artist
continually
mirrors
nature
in
its
eternal
essential
forms
but
for
the
present
moment
it
is
understood
is
it
not
that
these
words
have
been
used
in
their
common
everyday
popular
significance
the
dunciad
is
a
study
of
man
and
ode
on
intimations
of
immortality
is
a
study
of
man
and
the
literary
standpoint
that
we
have
been
attacking
is
that
of
pope
and
not
that
of
wordsworth
if
i
remember
the
next
test
we
have
to
analyse
is
that
of
artifice
often
and
improperly
called
art
but
i
think
we
have
already
demolished
this
criterion
in
distinguishing
between
art
and
artifice
i
pointed
out
that
the
latter
merely
signifies
the
adaptation
of
means
to
an
end
and
has
no
relation
whatever
with
art
properly
it
is
simply
the
mental
instrument
with
which
man
performs
every
task
and
every
work
of
his
daily
life
it
consists
in
the
rejection
of
that
which
is
unfit
for
the
particular
purpose
in
view
and
in
the
acceptance
and
use
of
that
which
is
fit
for
the
desired
end
and
likely
to
bring
it
about
it
concerns
not
creation
but
execution
and
it
is
i
need
hardly
say
as
indispensable
to
the
author
as
are
his
pen
and
ink
and
i
might
almost
say
is
as
little
concerned
as
these
with
the
essence
of
his
art
of
course
in
works
of
the
very
highest
genius
we
may
declare
that
in
a
sense
art
has
become
all
in
all
that
the
necessary
artifice
has
been
interpenetrated
with
art
so
that
we
can
hardly
distinguish
in
our
minds
between
the
idea
and
the
realisation
of
it
in
such
cases
artifice
has
been
lifted
up
and
exalted
into
the
heaven
of
art
and
it
remains
artifice
no
longer
but
in
the
view
that
we
are
considering
it
is
merely
the
adaptation
of
means
to
an
end
a
clever
choice
of
incident
the
knack
of
putting
in
and
leaving
out
the
faculty
may
as
i
said
be
glorified
and
transfigured
by
genius
but
every
newspaper
reporter
must
have
more
or
less
of
it
and
it
is
clear
enough
i
think
perhaps
i
may
mention
wilkie
collins
once
more
that
in
itself
it
can
not
establish
the
claim
of
any
book
to
be
fine
literature
and
lastly
we
have
to
deal
with
style
and
here
again
i
must
have
recourse
to
my
distinctions
what
a
good
style
if
you
mean
by
a
good
style
one
that
delivers
the
author
meaning
in
the
clearest
possible
manner
if
its
purpose
and
effect
are
obviously
utilitarian
if
it
be
designed
solely
with
the
view
of
imparting
knowledge
the
knowledge
of
what
the
author
intends
then
i
must
point
out
that
style
in
this
sense
is
or
should
be
amongst
the
accomplishments
of
every
commercial
clerk
indeed
it
will
be
merely
a
synonym
for
plain
speaking
and
plain
writing
and
in
this
sense
it
is
evidently
not
one
of
the
marks
of
art
since
the
object
of
art
is
not
information
but
a
peculiar
kind
of
æsthetic
delight
but
if
on
the
other
hand
style
is
to
mean
such
a
use
and
choice
of
words
and
phrases
and
cadences
that
the
ear
and
the
soul
through
the
ear
receive
an
impression
of
subtle
but
most
beautiful
music
if
the
sense
and
sound
and
colour
of
the
words
affect
us
with
an
almost
inexplicable
delight
then
i
say
that
while
idea
is
the
soul
style
is
the
glorified
body
of
the
very
highest
literary
art
style
in
short
is
the
last
perfection
of
the
very
best
in
literature
it
is
the
outward
sign
of
the
burning
grace
within
but
we
must
keep
the
systematic
consideration
of
style
for
some
other
night
it
not
a
subject
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
way
and
i
have
only
said
so
much
because
it
was
necessary
to
draw
the
line
between
language
as
a
means
of
imparting
facts
good
style
in
the
sense
of
our
opponents
and
language
as
an
æsthetic
instrument
which
is
a
good
or
rather
a
beautiful
style
in
our
sense
in
the
latter
sense
it
is
the
form
of
fine
literature
in
the
former
sense
it
is
the
medium
of
all
else
that
is
expressed
in
words
from
a
bill
of
exchange
upwards
it
seems
to
me
then
that
we
have
considered
one
by
one
the
alternative
tests
of
fine
literature
which
have
been
or
may
be
proposed
and
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
each
and
all
are
impossible
it
is
no
longer
permissible
i
imagine
for
you
or
for
me
to
say
this
book
is
fine
literature
because
it
makes
me
cry
because
it
was
so
interesting
that
i
could
put
it
down
because
it
is
so
natural
and
faithful
to
life
because
it
is
so
well
plainly
and
neatly
written
we
have
picked
these
reasons
to
pieces
one
by
one
and
the
result
is
that
we
are
driven
back
on
my
word
of
the
enigma
ecstasy
the
infallible
instrument
as
i
think
by
which
fine
literature
may
be
discerned
from
by
which
art
may
be
known
from
artifice
and
style
from
intelligent
expression
at
any
rate
we
have
got
our
hypothesis
and
you
remember
what
stress
coleridge
laid
on
the
necessity
of
forming
some
hypothesis
before
entering
on
any
investigation
i
believe
we
began
with
the
evening
paper
and
the
strange
glimpse
it
gives
us
through
a
veil
through
a
cloud
of
laborious
nonsense
about
odds
and
winners
and
tips
and
all
such
foolery
into
that
ancient
eternal
desire
of
man
for
the
unknown
and
that
you
remember
was
one
of
the
synonyms
that
i
offered
you
for
ecstasy
and
so
in
a
sense
i
expect
that
we
shall
have
the
evening
paper
close
beside
us
all
the
way
of
our
long
voyage
in
quest
of
the
lost
atlantis
ii
i
think
it
is
a
horrible
thing
to
have
such
a
good
memory
as
that
i
recollect
now
that
you
remind
me
that
i
did
lay
down
pickwick
vanity
fair
as
a
sort
of
test
case
of
my
theory
of
literature
but
you
surely
do
not
expect
me
to
work
out
the
arguments
in
detail
of
course
if
i
were
giving
a
series
of
lectures
i
should
set
a
paper
after
each
one
but
i
expect
you
to
content
yourself
with
the
suggestion
with
the
skeleton
map
as
it
were
besides
if
we
take
that
special
case
of
two
eminent
victorian
novels
as
a
concrete
instance
of
the
abstract
argument
do
you
see
that
we
are
answering
the
particular
question
all
the
while
that
we
are
investigating
the
general
proposition
surely
if
you
recollect
all
that
we
said
about
fine
literature
in
general
you
wo
have
much
difficulty
in
adjudicating
on
the
claims
of
thackeray
do
you
see
that
he
never
withdraws
himself
from
the
common
life
and
the
common
consciousness
that
he
is
all
the
while
nothing
but
a
photographer
a
showman
with
a
set
of
pictures
a
consummately
clever
photographer
certainly
a
showman
with
a
gift
of
amusing
interesting
patter
that
is
quite
extraordinary
an
artificer
of
very
high
merit
but
where
will
you
find
ecstasy
in
thackeray
where
is
his
adoration
you
may
search
i
think
from
one
end
of
his
books
to
the
other
without
finding
any
evidence
that
he
realised
the
mystery
of
things
he
was
never
for
a
moment
aware
of
that
shadowy
double
that
strange
companion
of
man
who
walks
as
i
said
foot
to
foot
with
each
one
of
us
and
yet
his
paces
are
in
an
unknown
world
and
unless
you
have
got
any
fresh
arguments
i
think
we
decided
last
week
that
the
book
which
lacks
the
sense
of
all
this
is
not
fine
literature
i
hope
you
do
think
i
am
abusing
thackeray
i
am
always
reading
him
and
i
chose
his
vanity
fair
because
it
strikes
me
as
such
a
supremely
clever
example
of
its
class
i
suppose
there
is
nothing
more
amusing
than
the
society
of
a
brilliant
observant
man
of
the
world
well
thackeray
was
brilliant
and
observant
and
besides
that
he
understood
the
artifice
of
and
he
could
write
a
terse
english
which
was
always
sufficient
for
his
purpose
he
contrives
the
corporal
overthrow
of
the
marquis
of
steyne
he
shows
you
that
bald
old
nobleman
sprawling
on
the
floor
and
the
words
that
he
uses
are
his
brisk
willing
and
capable
servants
he
has
observation
and
artifice
and
style
in
that
secondary
sense
which
we
distinguished
from
the
real
style
from
those
melodies
unheard
which
i
called
i
think
rather
picturesquely
the
glorified
body
of
the
highest
literary
art
but
these
qualities
we
found
out
are
not
separately
or
conjointly
the
differentia
of
fine
literature
as
we
understand
the
term
and
consequently
with
all
our
admiration
and
all
our
interest
we
are
compelled
to
place
thackeray
in
the
lower
form
simply
because
he
is
clearly
and
decisively
lacking
in
that
one
essential
quality
of
ecstasy
because
he
never
leaves
the
street
and
the
highroad
to
wander
on
the
eternal
hills
because
he
does
not
seem
to
be
aware
that
such
hills
exist
of
course
i
have
only
taken
thackeray
as
the
representative
of
his
class
and
i
chose
him
as
i
remarked
because
for
me
he
is
the
most
favourable
representative
of
it
i
am
thinking
really
of
the
plain
man
whom
we
have
engaged
in
so
many
forms
and
of
his
plain
argument
which
comes
to
this
for
me
a
great
book
is
a
book
that
amuses
me
greatly
and
that
i
enjoy
reading
and
i
say
that
thackeray
amuses
me
greatly
and
that
i
enjoy
reading
his
books
immensely
but
that
with
due
respect
to
common
sense
such
an
argument
fails
to
prove
that
vanity
fair
is
fine
literature
other
people
would
no
doubt
have
chosen
other
books
many
would
have
selected
miss
austen
and
i
daresay
they
would
have
a
good
deal
to
say
for
their
choice
undoubtedly
there
is
a
severity
a
a
fineness
of
observation
a
delicacy
of
irony
in
pride
and
prejudice
which
are
unmatched
of
their
kind
the
thackeray
of
the
caricatures
of
those
queer
woodblocks
comes
out
now
and
then
in
the
books
and
digression
occasionally
goes
beyond
due
bounds
but
i
named
vanity
fair
because
personally
i
find
it
more
amusing
than
pride
and
prejudice
in
neither
of
these
books
is
there
art
in
our
high
sense
of
the
word
and
in
preferring
the
one
over
the
other
i
am
simply
saying
that
i
prefer
the
company
of
a
brilliant
and
witty
cosmopolitan
to
that
of
a
very
keen
and
delicate
but
very
limited
maiden
lady
who
lives
in
a
remote
country
town
and
understands
thoroughly
the
reason
why
the
vicar
bowed
so
low
when
a
certain
carriage
rolled
up
the
high
street
and
why
that
pretty
prim
girl
crossed
over
the
way
when
the
handsome
gentleman
from
the
hall
came
out
of
the
chymist
yes
the
cosmopolitan
at
the
club
window
certainly
fails
a
little
in
his
manners
now
and
then
and
the
country
gentlewoman
breeding
is
perfect
of
its
kind
but
the
circles
in
which
pendennis
moved
are
to
me
so
infinitely
the
more
entertaining
of
the
two
you
see
i
think
that
the
question
of
liking
a
book
or
not
liking
it
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
consideration
of
fine
art
art
is
if
i
may
say
so
just
as
the
tenth
commandment
is
there
and
if
we
do
like
them
so
much
the
worse
for
us
i
may
find
homer
very
dull
reading
i
may
covet
your
ox
and
your
ass
and
everything
that
is
yours
but
my
limited
and
somewhat
commonplace
brains
and
my
envy
of
your
prosperity
wo
alter
the
fact
that
the
odyssey
is
fine
literature
and
that
covetousness
is
wicked
but
when
we
once
leave
the
utterances
of
the
eternal
universal
human
ecstasy
which
we
have
agreed
to
call
art
and
descend
to
these
lower
levels
that
we
are
talking
of
now
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
of
liking
or
not
liking
counts
for
a
good
deal
not
for
everything
of
course
we
must
still
distinguish
between
plots
stupid
or
ingenious
between
observation
that
is
close
and
keen
and
observation
that
is
vague
and
inaccurate
between
artifice
and
the
want
of
it
between
sentences
that
are
neatly
constructed
and
mere
slipshod
all
these
things
naturally
reckon
in
the
account
but
when
they
have
been
estimated
and
allowed
their
value
you
will
usually
find
that
you
are
influenced
still
more
by
your
mere
liking
or
disliking
of
the
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
legitimately
for
if
you
look
closely
into
the
whole
question
you
will
find
that
you
are
judging
these
secondary
books
as
you
judge
of
life
as
you
choose
the
scene
of
your
holiday
as
you
read
the
newspaper
one
man
may
say
that
he
prefers
to
talk
to
artists
another
quite
legitimately
may
love
the
society
of
brewers
you
may
think
norway
perfection
i
am
going
to
constantinople
turns
at
once
to
the
quotation
for
turpentine
at
savannah
folds
down
the
sheet
at
the
police
news
it
is
not
a
question
of
art
but
of
taste
that
is
of
individual
humour
and
constitution
you
frequent
the
company
that
suits
you
you
go
to
the
place
you
like
you
read
the
news
that
happens
to
be
most
interesting
from
your
special
standpoint
and
in
the
same
way
if
i
find
the
conversation
of
miss
becky
sharpe
as
reported
by
mr
thackeray
more
amusing
than
the
conversation
of
miss
elizabeth
bennett
as
reported
by
miss
jane
austen
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
elizabeth
remarks
are
more
skilfully
reported
very
likely
but
granting
that
i
had
rather
listen
to
the
record
imperfect
if
you
please
of
the
other
lady
conversation
here
is
a
speech
on
bimetallism
given
at
great
length
and
let
us
presume
with
great
accuracy
here
is
a
short
summary
of
professor
lecture
on
the
eleusinian
mysteries
very
badly
but
you
see
i
happen
not
to
care
twopence
about
bimetallism
so
i
turn
away
from
the
careful
report
growling
while
i
cut
out
that
wretched
summary
of
the
lecture
with
the
purpose
of
pasting
it
in
my
since
every
word
about
the
eleusinian
mysteries
has
a
vivid
interest
for
me
it
often
amuses
me
to
hear
people
quarrelling
about
the
rival
artistic
merit
of
books
which
have
in
most
cases
no
artistic
merits
at
all
writes
a
book
about
greengrocers
and
you
who
find
something
singularly
piquant
and
entertaining
in
the
manners
speech
and
habits
of
the
class
in
question
pronounce
to
be
a
great
artist
who
has
written
a
masterpiece
i
love
dukes
and
b
novel
of
the
peerage
strikes
me
as
a
marvel
of
artistic
accomplishment
while
i
pronounce
the
work
that
has
charmed
you
to
be
as
stupid
and
tiresome
as
the
class
it
represents
each
of
us
is
talking
nonsense
there
is
no
art
in
the
question
which
is
purely
a
matter
of
individual
taste
the
stock
exchange
column
interests
one
man
while
the
latest
football
news
absorbs
the
other
that
is
all
of
course
as
i
said
artifice
counts
for
something
there
is
a
pleasure
in
seeing
the
thing
neatly
done
and
i
suppose
it
is
this
pleasure
that
has
secured
miss
austen
her
fervent
admirers
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
treat
this
form
of
pleasure
quite
fairly
a
musician
perhaps
would
find
it
difficult
to
answer
the
question
whether
he
would
rather
hear
palestrina
badly
rendered
or
zingarelli
executed
to
perfection
in
the
latter
case
there
would
certainly
be
the
charm
of
exquisite
voices
in
perfect
order
and
accord
though
the
music
were
nothing
or
worse
than
nothing
still
our
musician
might
say
on
the
other
hand
that
palestrina
martyred
was
better
than
zingarelli
triumphant
i
am
afraid
i
can
imagine
myself
saying
limited
as
seen
by
jane
austen
are
so
that
they
rather
bore
me
though
the
author
has
portrayed
them
with
wonderful
skill
but
i
can
hardly
fancy
myself
affirming
that
becky
sharpe
is
such
an
interesting
personage
that
she
would
still
delight
me
even
if
the
author
of
ten
thousand
a
year
had
written
her
history
on
the
other
hand
i
believe
that
the
plot
of
jekyll
and
hyde
would
still
have
had
some
fascination
though
it
had
been
treated
by
the
veriest
dolt
in
letters
but
that
is
not
a
good
example
since
jekyll
and
hyde
is
certainly
in
its
conception
though
not
in
its
execution
a
work
of
fine
art
let
us
take
the
moonstone
again
as
an
example
i
believe
then
that
if
the
events
related
in
it
had
caught
our
eyes
in
a
brief
newspaper
paragraph
they
would
still
have
interested
it
seems
to
me
that
after
all
this
question
of
artifice
of
how
the
thing
is
done
comes
under
the
same
category
as
liking
and
disliking
i
mean
it
is
largely
a
matter
of
the
personal
equation
about
which
no
very
strict
laws
can
be
laid
down
you
might
say
for
example
that
becky
would
entertain
you
in
any
hands
however
indifferent
provided
that
her
facts
were
preserved
and
i
do
see
that
i
could
argue
the
point
with
you
it
reminds
me
again
of
the
way
in
which
men
choose
their
friends
one
lays
stress
on
pleasant
manners
another
on
sterling
goodness
of
character
a
third
on
wit
a
fourth
on
distinction
of
some
kind
and
argument
is
really
voiceless
here
is
a
you
may
say
look
how
exquisitely
it
is
made
yes
but
i
do
want
a
whereas
that
table
ricketty
as
it
is
will
be
really
useful
but
if
you
were
to
say
look
at
westminster
abbey
you
can
hardly
imagine
my
answering
bother
westminster
abbey
i
want
a
you
see
how
here
again
we
come
to
the
generic
difference
between
fine
literature
and
interesting
reading
matter
we
read
the
odyssey
because
we
are
supernatural
because
we
hear
in
it
the
echoes
of
the
eternal
song
because
it
symbolises
for
us
certain
amazing
and
beautiful
things
because
it
is
music
we
read
miss
austen
and
thackeray
because
we
like
to
recognise
the
faces
of
our
friends
aptly
reproduced
to
see
the
external
face
of
humanity
so
deftly
mimicked
because
we
are
natural
the
question
of
our
preference
for
one
over
the
other
is
making
due
allowance
for
analogy
the
question
of
our
preference
for
a
table
over
a
bookcase
or
and
the
workmanship
in
each
case
is
largely
a
matter
of
detail
and
the
great
poem
may
be
equated
with
the
great
church
each
is
made
for
beauty
the
one
is
ecstasy
in
words
the
other
ecstasy
in
stone
but
the
church
and
the
on
the
other
hand
are
not
to
be
compared
together
incidentally
no
doubt
the
former
is
rainproof
or
in
ill
repair
has
good
or
bad
acoustic
properties
while
the
latter
may
be
either
an
æsthetic
pest
in
the
or
an
agreeable
looking
little
shed
enough
still
the
essence
of
the
church
is
beauty
ecstasy
of
the
sty
utility
the
safe
keeping
of
pigs
it
would
be
absurd
you
see
to
say
i
prefer
an
abbey
to
a
and
it
would
be
equally
absurd
to
say
i
prefer
the
to
and
prejudice
or
i
prefer
the
venus
of
the
louvre
to
the
in
the
exhibition
of
course
these
are
only
analogies
and
you
press
them
but
they
may
help
to
make
my
meaning
clearer
to
enforce
the
vast
distinction
between
art
and
artifice
please
do
think
that
i
wish
to
establish
a
proportion
as
a
is
to
an
abbey
so
is
jane
austen
to
sophocles
in
her
case
you
would
have
to
substitute
a
neat
georgian
house
for
and
then
i
think
you
would
have
a
very
fair
proportion
but
all
that
i
wanted
to
do
was
to
draw
the
line
between
things
made
for
use
to
occupy
some
definite
place
in
relation
to
our
common
daily
life
and
things
made
by
ecstasy
and
for
ecstasy
things
that
are
symbols
proclaiming
the
presence
of
the
unknown
world
and
i
chose
pickwick
as
the
antithesis
to
vanity
fair
deliberately
thackeray
in
my
private
judgment
is
the
chief
of
those
who
have
provided
interesting
dickens
is
by
no
means
in
the
first
rank
of
literary
artists
i
think
he
is
golden
but
he
is
very
largely
alloyed
with
baser
stuff
with
indifferent
metal
which
was
the
product
of
his
age
of
his
circumstances
in
life
of
his
own
uncertain
taste
just
contrast
the
atmosphere
which
surrounded
the
young
sophocles
with
that
in
which
the
young
dickens
flourished
both
were
men
of
genius
but
one
grew
up
in
the
city
of
the
violet
crown
the
other
in
camden
town
and
worse
places
one
was
accustomed
to
breathe
that
most
pellucid
air
the
other
inhaled
the
london
particular
the
wonder
is
not
that
there
are
faults
in
dickens
but
that
there
is
genius
of
any
kind
i
am
not
going
to
analyze
pickwick
any
more
than
i
analyzed
vanity
fair
but
of
course
you
see
that
in
its
conception
it
is
essentially
one
with
the
odyssey
it
is
a
book
of
wandering
you
start
from
your
own
doorstep
and
you
stray
into
the
unknown
every
turn
of
the
road
fills
you
with
surmise
every
little
village
is
a
discovery
a
something
new
a
creation
you
know
not
what
may
happen
next
you
are
journeying
through
another
world
i
need
not
remind
you
how
glorious
all
this
is
in
the
odyssey
which
of
course
is
so
much
more
beautiful
than
pickwick
as
that
glowing
mediterranean
sea
whose
bounds
on
every
side
were
mystery
is
more
beautiful
than
the
muddy
foggy
thames
as
those
rolling
hexameters
are
more
beautiful
than
dickens
prose
and
yet
in
each
case
the
symbol
is
in
reality
the
same
both
the
heroic
song
of
the
old
ionian
world
and
the
comic
cockney
romance
of
communicate
that
enthralling
impression
of
the
unknown
which
is
at
once
a
whole
philosophy
of
life
and
the
most
exquisite
of
emotions
in
varying
degrees
of
intensity
you
will
trace
it
all
through
fine
literature
in
every
age
and
in
every
nation
you
will
find
it
in
celtic
voyages
in
the
eastern
tale
where
a
door
in
a
dull
street
suddenly
opens
into
dreamland
in
the
mediæval
stories
of
the
wandering
knights
in
don
quixote
and
at
last
in
our
pickwick
where
ulysses
has
become
a
retired
city
man
whimsically
journeying
up
and
down
the
england
of
sixty
years
ago
you
talk
of
the
grotesquerie
of
pickwick
but
you
see
that
this
element
is
present
in
all
the
masterpieces
of
the
kind
remember
the
cyclops
remember
the
grotesque
shapes
that
decorate
the
arabian
nights
remember
the
bizarre
element
the
almost
wanton
grotesquerie
of
many
of
the
arthur
romances
in
all
these
cases
as
in
pickwick
the
same
result
is
obtained
an
overpowering
impression
of
strangeness
of
remoteness
of
withdrawal
from
the
common
ways
of
life
pickwick
is
in
no
sense
or
in
no
valuable
sense
a
portrayal
a
copy
an
imitation
of
life
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
imitation
and
life
pickwick
and
sam
and
jingle
and
the
rest
of
them
are
not
clever
reproductions
of
actual
people
is
there
any
more
foolish
pursuit
than
that
of
disputing
about
the
original
of
mr
pickwick
the
book
is
rather
the
suggestion
of
another
life
beneath
our
own
or
beside
our
own
and
the
characters
those
queer
grotesque
people
are
queer
for
the
same
reason
that
the
cyclops
is
queer
and
the
dwarfs
and
dragons
of
mediæval
romance
are
queer
we
are
withdrawn
from
the
common
ways
of
life
and
in
that
withdrawal
is
the
beginning
of
ecstasy
there
are
sentences
in
pickwick
that
give
me
an
almost
extravagant
delight
you
remember
the
lines
about
the

well
do
you
know
there
is
a
brief
dialogue
in
pickwick
that
seems
almost
as
enchanted
to
me
the
scene
is
the
kitchen
on
christmas
eve
it
snows
said
one
of
the
men
in
a
low
voice
does
it
said
wardle
cold
night
sir
replied
the
man
there
a
wind
got
up
that
drifts
it
across
the
fields
in
a
thick
white
cloud
does
jem
say
inquired
the
old
lady
ai
anything
the
matter
is
there
no
mother
replied
wardle
says
there
a
and
a
wind
that
piercing
cold
you
know
this
is
the
introduction
to
the
tale
of
gabriel
grub
an
admirable
legend
which
dickens
farsed
with
an
obtrusive
moral
but
i
confess
that
the
atmosphere
which
to
me
seems
all
the
wild
weather
and
the
wild
legend
of
the
north
suggested
by
those
phrases
a
thick
white
cloud
and
a
wind
that
piercing
cold
is
in
my
judgment
wholly
marvellous
but
dickens
of
course
is
full
of
impressions
which
never
become
expressions
you
remember
that
chapter
about
the
lawyer
clerks
in
the
magpie
and
stump
it
is
always
quite
pathetic
to
me
to
note
how
dickens
the
strangeness
the
mystery
the
haunting
that
are
like
a
mist
about
the
old
inns
of
court
and
how
utterly
unable
he
was
to
express
his
emotion
to
find
a
fit
symbol
for
his
meaning
he
takes
refuge
as
it
were
behind
jack
bamber
who
tells
two
very
insignificant
legends
as
to
the
mystery
of
the
inns
dickens
feels
that
these
legends
are
insignificant
and
throws
in
one
that
is
pure
burlesque
and
then
changes
the
subject
in
despair
the
vague
impression
has
refused
to
be
put
into
words
probably
indeed
it
had
stopped
short
of
becoming
thought
but
i
am
afraid
that
if
i
once
begin
to
talk
about
the
defects
and
faults
of
dickens
i
shall
run
on
for
ever
and
i
think
you
will
be
able
to
find
out
his
laches
quite
well
for
yourself
what
i
want
to
insist
on
is
his
sense
of
mystery
his
withdrawal
from
common
life
and
finally
his
ecstasy
i
have
not
proved
my
case
up
to
the
hilt
by
a
analysis
of
pickwick
but
i
think
i
have
suggested
the
heads
of
such
an
analysis
there
is
ecstasy
in
the
main
idea
in
the
thought
of
the
man
who
wanders
away
from
his
familiar
streets
into
unknown
tracks
and
lanes
and
villages
there
is
ecstasy
in
the
conception
of
all
those
queer
grotesque
characters
reminders
each
one
of
the
strangeness
of
life
there
is
ecstasy
in
the
thought
of
the
wild
christmas
eve
of
the
fields
and
woods
scourged
by
a
wind
piercing
cold
hidden
by
the
thick
cloud
of
snow
there
is
ecstasy
in
that
vague
impression
of
the
old
dark
inns
of
the
rotten
chambers
that
had
been
shut
up
for
years
and
years
in
a
word
pickwick
is
fine
literature
well
you
got
what
you
wanted
some
sort
of
analysis
of
my
case
fair
but
it
must
be
clearly
understood
that
i
not
going
to
work
out
every
example
however
i
am
not
sorry
that
i
have
been
led
to
go
into
this
particular
case
rather
fully
because
it
is
a
typical
one
and
we
shall
not
be
obliged
to
go
over
the
same
ground
again
i
mean
that
having
witnessed
the
dissection
of
thackeray
you
will
have
no
need
to
come
to
me
for
my
judgment
of
george
eliot
or
of
anthony
trollope
or
to
make
a
very
long
list
a
very
short
one
of
about
per
cent
of
our
modern
novels
yes
you
have
mentioned
a
great
name
and
i
like
you
take
off
my
cap
to
the
man
who
has
gone
on
his
way
without
caring
for
the
public
or
the
reviewers
or
anything
else
except
his
own
judgment
of
what
is
right
but
frankly
if
you
pass
from
the
man
and
come
to
his
work
my
plain
opinion
is
this
that
he
has
written
about
ordinary
life
regarded
from
an
ordinary
standpoint
in
a
style
which
is
extraordinary
certainly
but
very
far
from
beautiful
it
is
not
a
beautiful
style
since
a
fine
style
though
it
may
carry
suggestion
beyond
the
bourne
of
thought
though
it
may
be
the
veil
and
visible
body
of
concealed
mysteries
is
always
plain
on
the
surface
it
may
be
like
an
ingeniously
devised
cryptogram
which
may
have
an
occult
sense
conveyed
to
initiated
eyes
in
every
dot
and
line
and
flourish
but
is
outwardly
as
simple
and
straightforward
as
a
business
letter
but
in
the
works
of
the
writer
whom
we
are
discussing
obscurities
dubieties
of
all
kinds
are
far
from
uncommon
and
in
many
of
his
books
there
are
passages
which
hardly
seem
to
be
english
at
all
the
words
are
familiar
most
of
them
the
grammatical
construction
often
offers
no
very
considerable
difficulties
it
is
rarely
i
mean
that
one
has
to
search
very
long
for
the
nominative
of
the
sentence
but
when
one
has
read
the
words
and
parsed
them
one
feels
inclined
to
think
that
after
all
the
passage
is
not
in
english
but
in
some
other
language
with
a
superficial
resemblance
to
english
style
is
not
everything
certainly
not
a
book
may
fail
in
style
and
yet
be
fine
though
not
the
finest
literature
you
have
only
to
open
sir
walter
scott
to
have
highly
conclusive
evidence
on
that
point
but
the
writer
we
are
considering
not
only
fails
in
the
body
of
art
but
even
more
conspicuously
in
the
soul
of
it
just
think
for
a
moment
of
his
story
of
the
very
earnest
jew
who
fell
in
love
with
the
baroness
who
was
not
very
earnest
there
was
a
false
female
friend
you
remember
and
social
complications
perturbed
the
hearts
of
the
curiously
assorted
lovers
and
finally
the
jew
was
shot
in
a
duel
by
another
less
detrimental
courtier
can
you
conceive
anything
more
trivial
than
this
do
you
see
that
from
such
a
book
as
that
the
the
soul
of
fine
literature
is
completely
lacking
great
books
may
always
be
summed
up
in
a
phrase
often
in
a
single
word
and
that
phrase
or
that
word
will
always
signify
some
primary
and
palmary
idea
to
me
the
only
idea
suggested
by
the
plot
i
have
outlined
is
unimportance
and
as
in
the
case
of
thackeray
ecstasy
is
entirely
absent
both
from
this
and
from
all
other
of
the
books
you
say
that
after
all
the
plot
in
question
is
a
plot
of
the
love
of
a
man
for
a
woman
and
that
is
an
idea
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
and
an
idea
which
is
the
most
of
all
fit
for
the
purpose
and
the
making
of
the
finest
literature
i
agree
with
you
in
the
latter
clause
of
your
sentence
but
i
must
point
out
that
the
book
is
the
story
of
the
love
of
a
man
for
a
woman
it
is
the
story
of
the
flirtation
of
a
baroness
with
a
german
jew
socialist
a
very
different
matter
in
a
word
it
is
a
tale
of
the
accidental
of
the
particular
of
the
inessential
it
is
completely
the
play
of
hamlet
with
the
part
of
hamlet
omitted
and
the
greatest
stress
laid
on
the
minor
characters
it
is
quite
true
that
when
an
author
writes
a
romance
containing
a
hero
and
a
heroine
he
must
tell
you
who
they
are
he
must
give
briefly
and
succinctly
the
necessary
details
names
ages
conditions
and
so
forth
but
if
he
is
a
great
author
he
will
do
this
incidentally
and
make
us
feel
that
such
details
are
incidental
in
short
he
must
poise
his
feet
on
earth
but
his
way
is
to
the
stars
think
of
the
scarlet
letter
open
it
again
and
see
how
admirably
hawthorne
has
omitted
a
world
of
unessential
details
that
a
lesser
man
would
have
put
in
he
has
left
out
a
whole
encyclopædia
of
useless
and
tedious
information
there
is
the
dim
necessary
background
of
time
and
place
but
in
reality
the
scene
is
eternity
and
the
drama
is
the
mystery
of
love
and
vengeance
and
of
course
fine
literature
must
have
its
gross
and
carnal
body
we
must
know
who
who
for
i
do
think
an
receipt
that
i
remember
was
ever
very
successful
oh
you
must
have
read
some
of
the
tales
i
mean
they
used
to
flourish
in
the
old
keepsakes
and
the
hero
was
boldly
labelled
fernando
for
all
distinction
and
description
one
might
surmise
that
fernando
was
domiciled
on
the
continent
of
europe
but
that
was
all
it
was
not
successful
this
school
of
fiction
and
i
repeat
that
the
finest
literature
must
have
its
accidents
it
can
not
exist
as
shining
substance
alone
it
is
just
the
same
with
the
art
of
sculpture
with
the
art
of
painting
you
can
not
look
at
a
greek
apollo
without
looking
at
that
part
of
the
body
which
conceals
the
bowels
but
i
imagine
you
do
want
to
treasure
this
thought
or
to
insist
on
it
and
i
suppose
a
geologist
looking
at
a
picture
could
tell
you
whether
those
wild
and
terrible
rocks
were
volcanic
or
carboniferous
but
really
one
does
want
to
know
bowels
geological
formation
in
sculpture
and
painting
the
social
position
of
the
characters
and
all
other
such
details
in
fine
literature
are
inessential
and
the
great
artist
will
as
i
said
make
us
feel
that
they
are
inessential
if
you
want
an
instance
of
what
i
mean
read
a
book
which
is
very
comparable
with
the
tale
that
we
were
talking
about
i
mean
two
on
a
tower
by
mr
hardy
in
that
you
have
the
contrast
of
social
ranks
the
two
are
the
lady
of
the
manor
and
an
educated
peasant
but
how
utterly
all
thought
of
society
in
any
sense
of
the
word
disappears
from
those
wonderful
pages
as
you
advance
and
find
that
the
theme
is
really
love
why
even
the
accidents
are
glorified
and
are
made
of
the
essence
of
the
book
the
old
tower
standing
in
the
midst
of
lonely
red
ploughlands
far
from
the
highway
is
at
first
only
the
convenient
place
where
the
young
peasant
studies
astronomy
but
as
you
read
you
feel
the
change
coming
the
tower
is
transmuted
glorified
every
stone
of
it
is
aglow
with
mystic
light
it
is
made
the
abode
of
the
lover
and
the
beloved
it
is
seen
to
be
a
symbol
of
love
of
an
ecstasy
remote
and
passionate
and
eternal
dwelling
far
from
the
ways
of
men
compare
these
two
books
i
say
again
and
you
will
know
the
chief
distinction
between
fine
literature
and
reading
matter
to
me
i
confess
the
has
not
even
interest
of
the
lower
sort
not
by
any
means
the
interest
of
thackeray
or
jane
austen
or
even
of
poor
dreary
george
eliot
but
if
you
are
amused
by
it
i
have
no
objection
to
make
you
may
be
amused
by
the
plates
of
the
spring
and
summer
novelties
in
the
lady
paper
if
you
please
but
for
heaven
sake
do
come
here
and
tell
me
that
on
the
whole
you
prefer
botticelli
primavera
nay
but
the
are
sometimes
very
nicely
done
and
they
put
in
backgrounds
and
they
are
trying
to
give
the
faces
some
character
do
get
it
into
your
head
firmly
and
fixedly
that
the
camera
and
the
soul
of
man
are
two
entirely
different
things
you
think
the
photographic
comparison
unfair
in
this
and
other
instances
because
of
the
mechanical
element
in
photography
because
of
that
camera
i
have
just
mentioned
well
i
suppose
that
it
a
little
misleading
the
sun
and
the
camera
between
them
certainly
do
your
picture
for
you
and
as
you
urge
there
is
more
of
artifice
in
the
merest
tale
than
in
the
best
of
photographs
still
you
must
remember
that
photography
too
has
its
artifice
its
choice
of
the
right
and
the
wrong
way
and
its
exercise
of
judgment
there
is
a
great
deal
in
it
that
is
not
mechanical
and
in
its
essence
it
is
of
the
same
class
as
the
books
i
have
been
alluding
to
the
means
employed
are
different
and
a
higher
and
finer
artifice
is
required
for
making
books
than
for
taking
photographs
but
the
end
of
each
is
the
same
and
that
end
is
to
portray
the
surface
of
life
to
make
a
picture
of
the
outside
of
things
it
is
on
this
ground
that
i
defend
my
use
of
the
analogy
and
you
must
understand
me
to
speak
only
of
the
object
which
is
common
to
each
when
i
compare
the
secondary
writer
to
a
photographer
the
writers
to
be
sure
have
invention
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
but
you
will
remark
that
the
artists
in
literature
have
the
power
of
creation
a
totally
different
process
invention
is
the
finding
of
a
thing
in
its
more
or
less
obscure
creation
is
the
making
of
a
new
thing
the
invocation
of
something
from
nothingness
don
quixote
is
a
creation
the
clergyman
in
pride
and
prejudice
is
an
invention
colonel
newcome
is
in
all
probability
a
composite
portrait
while
the
who
fell
in
love
with
the
baroness
is
simply
a
portrait
of
ferdinand
lassalle
you
must
remember
that
while
the
two
classes
fine
literature
and
reading
matter
differ
the
one
from
the
other
generically
the
individuals
of
each
class
differ
from
each
other
only
specifically
thus
the
difference
in
merit
between
the
odyssey
and
pickwick
is
enormous
but
it
is
a
specific
difference
in
the
same
way
it
is
hard
to
measure
with
the
imagination
the
difference
between
madame
bovary
and
that
famous
story
jackie
holiday
the
former
is
immensely
clever
the
latter
is
immensely
silly
but
the
two
are
emphatically
of
the
same
genus
in
each
case
the
effort
of
the
author
is
to
describe
life
the
aim
of
flaubert
is
absolutely
identical
with
the
aim
of
miss
flopkins
and
their
results
differ
only
as
the
frenchman
differs
from
the
englishwoman
the
one
being
a
serious
and
patient
artificer
while
the
other
is
a
bungling
idiot
who
obtrudes
her
very
empty
personality
and
her
very
trashy
ethics
instead
of
studiously
concealing
them
still
a
photograph
taken
in
the
most
famous
studio
in
london
is
still
a
photograph
equally
with
the
spotted
and
misty
effort
of
the
amateur
and
no
amount
of
or
finishing
however
patient
it
may
be
will
turn
a
photograph
into
a
work
of
art
and
in
like
manner
no
labour
no
care
no
polishing
of
the
phrase
no
patience
in
investigation
no
artifice
in
plot
or
in
construction
will
ever
make
into
fine
literature
iii
i
see
that
i
shall
be
obliged
to
keep
on
reiterating
the
difference
between
fine
literature
and
literature
or
in
other
words
between
art
and
observation
expressed
with
artifice
i
am
afraid
that
in
your
heart
of
hearts
you
still
believe
that
the
odyssey
is
fine
literature
and
that
pride
and
prejudice
is
fine
literature
though
the
odyssey
is
better
than
pride
and
prejudice
it
is
that
better
that
i
want
to
get
out
of
your
head
that
monstrous
fallacy
of
comparing
westminster
abbey
with
the
charming
old
houses
in
queen
square
you
would
see
the
absurdity
of
imagining
that
there
can
be
any
degree
of
comparison
between
two
things
entirely
different
if
i
substituted
for
pride
and
prejudice
some
ordinary
novel
of
our
own
times
at
least
i
hope
you
would
see
though
as
i
told
you
a
few
weeks
ago
i
doubt
very
much
whether
many
people
realise
the
distinction
between
the
odyssey
and
a
political
pamphlet
the
general
opinion
i
expect
is
that
both
belong
to
the
same
class
though
the
greek
poem
is
much
more
important
than
the
pamphlet
i
think
we
succeeded
in
demonstrating
the
falsity
of
this
idea
in
showing
clearly
and
decisively
that
fine
literature
means
the
expression
of
the
eternal
human
ecstasy
in
the
medium
of
words
and
that
it
means
nothing
else
whatsoever
words
it
is
true
are
used
for
other
ends
than
this
they
are
used
in
sending
telegrams
to
stockbrokers
for
example
but
why
should
this
double
office
create
any
confusion
a
tub
and
a
tabernacle
may
each
be
made
of
wood
but
you
do
mix
the
two
things
up
on
that
account
the
other
day
you
gave
me
a
most
amusing
account
of
your
landlady
quarrels
with
her
servant
girls
i
remember
that
i
laughed
consumedly
and
at
the
moment
that
solemn
preconisation
of
the
servant
mabel
to
the
effect
that
her
mistress
mrs
stickings
was
not
a
lydy
was
more
to
my
taste
than
the
recitation
of
the
ode
on
a
grecian
urn
but
you
surely
did
think
that
you
were
making
literature
all
the
while
or
that
the
history
of
mrs
stickings
and
mabel
would
have
mysteriously
become
literature
if
you
had
written
it
down
and
got
somebody
to
print
it
or
that
it
would
have
been
literature
if
some
of
the
details
had
been
a
little
exaggerated
i
thought
you
had
embroidered
here
and
there
or
if
you
had
made
the
whole
story
up
out
of
your
own
head
exactly
you
were
as
you
say
amusing
me
by
the
relation
of
facts
a
little
altered
compressed
and
embellished
and
i
am
glad
that
you
see
that
no
process
of
writing
or
printing
no
variation
in
the
proportion
of
truth
and
invention
even
to
the
total
lack
of
all
truth
could
have
changed
an
amusing
presentation
of
the
stickings
into
fine
literature
but
surely
it
is
so
very
obvious
did
any
cook
ever
think
that
he
could
change
a
turkey
into
a
bird
of
paradise
by
careful
attention
to
the
and
the
sauce
the
farmer
might
as
well
expect
to
breed
early
phœnixes
for
leadenhall
market
by
the
simple
process
of
lighting
a
bonfire
in
the
farmyard
the
young
ducks
would
jump
into
the
blaze
and
the
transformation
would
be
the
work
of
a
second
there
is
no
more
madness
in
notion
than
in
the
other
one
that
one
has
only
to
print
an
amusing
interesting
or
pathetic
tale
to
make
it
into
fine
literature
yes
but
what
i
am
afraid
is
still
lurking
somewhere
in
your
skull
is
this
that
if
only
the
stuffing
is
extremely
well
made
if
only
the
sauce
is
an
exquisite
concoction
the
turkey
somehow
or
other
changed
into
a
bird
of
paradise
that
is
to
translate
the
analogy
if
only
the
plot
is
very
ingenious
if
only
the
construction
is
well
carried
out
if
the
characters
are
extremely
if
the
english
is
admirably
neat
and
sufficient
then
becomes
fine
literature
make
the
bonfire
high
enough
and
your
young
ducks
will
be
burned
into
phœnixes
fast
enough
let
the
artifice
be
sufficiently
artificial
and
it
will
be
art
indeed
you
might
as
well
maintain
that
a
wooden
statue
if
it
be
really
well
carved
is
thereby
made
into
a
gold
statue
well
i
remember
saying
one
night
that
you
were
here
that
ecstasy
is
at
once
the
most
exquisite
of
emotions
and
a
whole
philosophy
of
life
and
it
is
to
the
philosophy
of
life
that
we
are
brought
in
the
last
resort
you
know
that
there
are
speaking
very
generally
two
solutions
of
existence
one
is
the
materialistic
or
rationalistic
the
other
the
spiritual
or
mystic
if
the
former
were
true
then
keats
would
be
a
queer
kind
of
madman
and
the
morte
would
be
an
elaborate
symptom
of
insanity
if
the
latter
is
true
then
pride
and
prejudice
is
not
fine
literature
and
the
works
of
george
eliot
are
the
works
of
a
superior
insect
and
nothing
more
you
must
make
your
choice
is
the
story
of
the
graal
lunacy
or
not
you
think
it
is
not
then
do
not
talk
any
more
of
turning
glass
into
diamonds
by
careful
polishing
and
cutting
do
not
say
mr
spends
five
years
over
a
book
and
therefore
what
he
writes
is
fine
literature
miss
polishes
off
five
novels
in
a
year
and
therefore
she
does
not
write
fine
literature
do
not
say
mr
shorthouse
has
got
the
name
of
a
man
who
kept
a
private
school
in
the
time
of
charles
quite
right
therefore
john
inglesant
is
fine
literature
while
the
archæological
details
in
ivanhoe
are
all
wrong
therefore
it
is
not
fine
literature
good
lord
you
might
as
well
say
but
my
landlady
name
is
mrs
stickings
and
the
girl
who
left
last
month
was
really
called
mabel
that
story
of
mine
was
fine
literature
what
that
about
sustained
effort
can
you
turn
a
deal
ladder
into
a
golden
staircase
by
making
it
of
a
thousand
rungs
what
i
say
three
times
is
right
eh
and
if
i
tell
the
tale
of
mrs
stickings
so
that
it
extends
to
our
minimum
length
for
three
volume
novels
it
becomes
fine
literature
well
i
really
hope
that
we
have
at
last
settled
the
matter
that
fine
literature
is
simply
the
expression
of
the
eternal
things
that
are
in
man
that
it
is
beauty
clothed
in
words
that
it
is
always
ecstasy
that
it
always
draws
itself
away
and
goes
apart
into
lonely
places
far
from
the
common
course
of
life
realise
this
and
you
will
never
be
misled
into
pronouncing
mere
however
interesting
to
be
fine
literature
and
now
that
we
clearly
understand
the
difference
between
the
two
i
propose
that
we
drop
the
fine
and
speak
simply
of
literature
but
i
assure
you
that
even
after
having
established
the
grand
distinction
it
is
by
no
means
plain
sailing
everything
terrestrial
is
so
composite
except
perhaps
pure
music
that
one
is
confronted
by
an
almost
endless
task
of
distinguishing
matter
from
form
and
body
from
spirit
literature
we
say
is
ecstasy
but
a
book
must
be
written
about
something
and
about
somebody
it
must
be
expressed
in
words
it
must
have
arrangement
and
artifice
it
must
have
accident
as
well
as
essence
consider
don
quixote
as
an
example
it
is
i
suppose
the
finest
prose
romance
in
existence
essentially
it
expresses
the
eternal
quest
of
the
unknown
that
longing
peculiar
to
man
which
makes
him
reach
out
towards
infinity
and
he
lifts
up
his
eyes
and
he
strains
his
eyes
looking
across
the
ocean
for
certain
fabled
happy
islands
for
avalon
that
is
beyond
the
setting
of
the
sun
and
he
comes
into
life
from
the
unknown
world
from
glorious
places
and
all
his
days
he
journeys
through
the
world
spying
about
him
going
on
and
ever
on
expecting
beyond
every
hill
to
find
the
holy
city
seeing
signs
and
omens
and
tokens
by
the
way
reminded
every
hour
of
his
everlasting
citizenship
from
the
great
deep
to
the
great
deep
he
goes
it
is
true
of
king
arthur
and
of
each
one
of
us
and
this
i
take
it
is
the
essence
of
don
quixote
and
of
all
his
forerunners
and
successors
then
in
the
second
place
you
get
the
eternal
moral
of
the
book
and
you
will
understand
that
i
am
not
using
moral
in
the
vulgar
sense
the
eternal
moral
then
of
don
quixote
is
the
strife
between
temporal
and
eternal
between
the
soul
and
the
body
between
things
spiritual
and
things
corporal
between
ecstasy
and
the
common
life
you
read
the
book
and
you
see
that
there
is
a
perpetual
jar
you
are
continually
confronted
by
the
great
antinomy
of
life
it
seems
a
mere
comic
incident
when
the
knight
dreaming
of
enchantment
is
knocked
about
and
made
ridiculous
but
i
tell
you
it
is
the
perpetual
tragedy
of
life
itself
symbolised
i
say
that
it
is
under
a
figure
the
picture
of
humanity
in
the
world
that
you
will
find
the
truth
it
represents
repeated
again
and
again
throughout
all
history
you
know
that
if
one
goes
back
resolutely
to
the
first
principles
of
things
one
finds
oneself
as
it
were
in
a
place
where
all
lines
that
seemed
parallel
and
eternally
divided
meet
and
so
it
is
with
this
tragedy
symbolised
by
the
don
quixote
it
is
you
may
say
the
tragedy
of
the
unknown
and
the
known
of
the
soul
and
body
of
the
idea
and
the
fact
of
ecstasy
and
common
life
at
last
i
suppose
of
good
and
evil
the
source
of
it
lies
far
beyond
our
understanding
but
its
symbol
is
shown
again
and
again
in
cervantes
page
then
there
is
a
third
element
in
the
book
the
author
intended
to
write
a
burlesque
on
the
current
romances
of
chivalry
and
he
wrote
i
suppose
the
best
burlesque
that
has
ever
been
written
or
ever
will
be
written
if
you
unhappily
so
choose
you
can
shut
your
eyes
to
everything
serious
and
everything
beautiful
and
read
merely
of
amadis
and
arthur
taken
off
of
the
highest
ideals
turned
into
nonsense
of
the
best
motives
shown
to
be
in
effect
mischievous
you
will
read
how
the
knight
in
the
approved
manner
of
knights
helped
the
oppressed
and
the
wretched
and
how
he
usually
worsened
their
condition
tenfold
you
may
lend
your
ear
to
sancho
grumbling
and
quoting
proverbs
all
the
road
as
he
rides
on
his
ass
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
wit
and
the
comedy
you
might
fancy
yourself
in
a
suburban
train
bound
for
the
city
why
if
you
so
please
don
quixote
is
the
institute
of
cynicism
the
reduction
of
every
generous
impulse
to
absurdity
finally
the
knight
is
the
mouthpiece
of
cervantes
himself
especially
towards
the
end
of
the
second
part
where
the
armour
and
the
fantasy
drop
off
piece
by
piece
and
shred
by
shred
on
that
mournful
homeward
journey
at
last
i
say
don
quixote
is
almost
simply
cervantes
commenting
on
men
and
affairs
in
spain
and
i
think
that
in
those
final
chapters
the
art
has
vanished
together
with
the
armour
and
the
ecstasy
yes
i
always
dread
the
ending
of
don
quixote
a
star
drops
a
line
of
streaming
fire
down
the
vault
of
the
sky
and
perhaps
you
may
have
seen
the
ugly
shapeless
thing
that
sinks
into
the
earth
but
this
very
brief
and
imperfect
analysis
of
a
great
masterpiece
of
literary
art
may
give
you
some
idea
of
the
extraordinary
complexity
of
all
literature
as
it
is
i
have
omitted
one
most
important
item
in
the
account
i
have
said
nothing
of
the
style
because
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
have
no
spanish
and
cervantes
speaks
to
me
through
an
interpreter
named
charles
jarvis
but
omitting
style
you
see
that
we
have
in
this
particular
case
five
books
in
one
we
have
the
utterance
of
pure
ecstasy
the
strife
between
ecstasy
and
the
common
life
the
burlesque
of
chivalry
the
institutes
of
cynicism
and
the
comments
on
affairs
each
of
these
different
themes
is
managed
with
consummate
ability
and
always
excepting
the
last
chapters
of
the
book
each
keeps
its
due
place
so
that
it
really
rests
with
the
reader
in
a
manner
to
choose
which
book
he
is
to
read
and
then
there
are
other
elements
which
must
be
accounted
for
if
one
is
to
judge
a
book
as
a
whole
fairly
and
thoroughly
i
may
be
so
charmed
with
the
writer
rapture
with
the
wonder
and
beauty
of
his
idea
that
i
may
forget
the
fact
that
the
artist
must
also
be
the
artificer
that
while
the
soul
conceives
the
understanding
must
formulate
the
conception
that
while
ecstasy
must
suggest
the
conduct
of
the
story
must
help
to
range
each
circumstance
in
order
that
while
an
inward
mysterious
delight
must
dictate
the
burning
phrases
and
sound
in
the
music
and
melody
of
the
words
cool
judgment
must
go
through
every
line
reminding
the
author
that
if
literature
be
the
language
of
the
shadowy
companion
it
must
yet
be
translated
out
of
the
unknown
speech
into
the
vulgar
tongue
here
then
we
have
the
elements
of
a
book
firstly
the
idea
or
conception
the
thing
of
exquisite
beauty
which
dwells
in
the
author
soul
not
yet
clothed
in
words
nor
even
in
thought
but
a
pure
emotion
secondly
when
this
emotion
has
taken
definite
form
is
made
incarnate
as
it
were
in
the
shape
of
a
story
which
can
be
roughly
jotted
down
on
paper
we
may
speak
of
the
plot
thirdly
the
plot
has
to
be
systematised
to
be
drawn
to
scale
to
be
carried
out
to
its
legitimate
conclusions
to
be
displayed
by
means
of
incident
and
here
we
have
construction
fourthly
the
story
is
to
be
written
down
and
style
is
the
invention
of
beautiful
words
which
shall
affect
the
reader
by
their
meaning
by
their
sound
by
their
mysterious
suggestion
this
then
is
the
fourfold
work
of
literature
and
if
you
want
to
be
perfect
you
must
be
perfect
in
each
part
art
must
inspire
and
shape
each
and
all
but
only
the
first
the
idea
is
pure
art
with
plot
and
construction
and
style
there
is
an
alloy
of
artifice
if
then
any
given
book
can
be
shown
to
proceed
from
an
idea
it
is
to
be
placed
in
the
class
of
literature
in
the
shelf
of
the
odyssey
as
i
think
i
once
expressed
it
it
may
be
placed
very
high
in
the
class
the
more
it
have
of
rapture
in
its
every
part
the
higher
it
will
be
or
it
may
be
placed
very
low
because
for
example
having
once
admired
the
conception
the
dream
that
came
to
the
author
from
the
other
world
we
are
forced
to
admit
that
the
story
or
plot
was
feebly
imagined
that
the
construction
was
clumsily
carried
out
that
the
style
is
æsthetically
you
will
notice
that
i
am
never
afraid
of
blaming
my
favourites
of
finding
fault
with
the
books
which
i
most
adore
i
can
do
so
freely
and
without
fear
of
consequences
since
having
once
applied
my
test
and
having
found
that
pickwick
for
example
is
literature
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
that
i
shall
be
compelled
to
eat
my
words
if
flaws
in
plot
and
style
and
construction
are
afterwards
made
apparent
the
statue
is
gold
we
have
settled
that
much
and
we
need
not
fear
that
it
will
turn
into
lead
if
we
find
that
the
graving
and
carving
is
poor
enough
once
be
sure
that
your
temple
a
temple
and
i
will
warrant
you
against
it
being
suddenly
transmuted
into
a
tub
through
the
discovery
of
scamped
workmanship
well
suppose
we
begin
to
apply
our
analysis
let
us
take
the
strange
case
of
mr
stevenson
and
especially
his
jekyll
and
hyde
which
in
some
ways
is
his
most
characteristic
and
most
effective
book
now
i
suppose
that
instructed
opinion
granting
its
existence
was
about
equally
divided
as
to
the
class
in
which
this
most
skilful
and
striking
story
was
to
be
placed
many
i
have
no
doubt
gave
it
a
very
high
place
in
the
ranks
of
imaginative
literature
or
as
we
should
now
say
in
the
ranks
of
literature
while
many
other
judges
set
it
down
as
an
extremely
clever
piece
of
sensationalism
and
nothing
more
well
i
think
both
these
opinions
are
wrong
and
i
should
be
inclined
to
say
that
jekyll
and
hyde
just
scrapes
by
the
skin
of
its
teeth
as
it
were
into
the
shelves
of
literature
and
no
more
on
the
surface
it
would
seem
to
be
merely
sensationalism
i
expect
that
when
you
read
it
you
did
so
with
breathless
absorption
hurrying
over
the
pages
in
your
eagerness
to
find
out
the
secret
and
this
secret
once
discovered
i
imagine
that
jekyll
and
hyde
retired
to
your
shelf
and
stays
there
rather
dusty
you
have
never
opened
it
again
exactly
i
read
it
for
a
second
time
and
i
was
astonished
to
find
how
it
had
if
i
may
say
so
evaporated
at
the
first
reading
one
was
enthralled
by
mere
curiosity
but
when
once
this
curiosity
had
been
satisfied
what
remained
if
i
may
speak
from
my
own
experience
simply
a
rather
languid
admiration
of
the
ingenuity
of
the
plot
with
its
construction
combined
with
a
slight
feeling
of
impatience
such
as
one
might
experience
if
one
were
asked
to
solve
a
puzzle
for
the
second
time
you
see
that
the
secret
once
disclosed
all
the
steps
which
lead
to
the
disclosure
become
insignificant
or
rather
they
become
nothing
at
all
since
their
only
significance
and
their
only
existence
lay
in
the
secret
and
when
the
secret
has
ceased
to
be
a
secret
the
signs
and
cyphers
of
it
fall
also
into
the
world
of
nonentity
you
may
be
amazed
and
perplexed
and
entranced
by
a
cryptogram
while
you
are
solving
it
but
the
solution
once
attained
your
cryptogram
is
either
nothing
or
perilously
near
to
nothingness
well
all
this
points
does
it
towards
mere
sensationalism
very
cleverly
done
but
as
i
said
i
think
jekyll
and
hyde
just
scrapes
over
the
and
takes
its
place
very
low
down
among
books
that
are
literature
and
i
base
my
verdict
solely
on
the
idea
on
the
conception
that
lies
buried
rather
deeply
beneath
the
plot
the
plot
in
itself
strikes
me
as
mechanical
this
actual
physical
transformation
produced
by
a
drug
linked
certainly
with
a
theory
of
ethical
change
but
not
linked
at
all
with
the
really
mysterious
the
really
psychical
all
this
affects
me
i
say
as
ingenious
mechanism
and
nothing
more
while
i
have
shown
how
the
construction
is
ingenious
artifice
and
the
style
is
affected
by
the
same
plague
of
laboured
ingenuity
throughout
it
is
a
thoroughly
conscious
style
and
in
literature
all
the
highest
things
are
unconsciously
or
at
least
subconsciously
produced
it
has
music
but
it
has
no
and
there
are
no
phrases
in
it
that
seem
veils
of
dreams
echoes
of
the
inexpressive
song
it
is
on
the
conception
then
alone
that
i
justify
my
inclusion
of
jekyll
amongst
works
of
art
for
it
seems
to
me
that
lurking
behind
the
plot
we
divine
the
presence
of
an
idea
of
an
inspiration
man
is
not
truly
one
but
truly
two
or
perhaps
a
polity
with
many
inhabitants
dr
jekyll
writes
in
his
confession
and
i
think
that
i
see
here
a
trace
that
mr
stevenson
had
received
a
vision
of
the
mystery
of
human
nature
compounded
of
the
dust
and
of
the
stars
of
a
dim
vast
city
splendid
and
ruinous
as
drowned
atlantis
deep
beneath
the
waves
of
a
haunted
quire
where
a
flickering
light
burns
before
the
veil
this
i
believe
was
the
vision
that
came
to
the
artist
but
the
admirable
artificer
seized
hold
of
it
at
once
and
made
it
all
his
own
omitting
what
he
did
not
understand
translating
roughly
from
the
unknown
tongue
materialising
coarsening
hardening
do
you
see
how
thoroughly
the
actual
plot
is
and
if
one
escapes
for
a
moment
from
the
atmosphere
of
the
laboratory
it
is
only
to
be
confronted
by
the
most
obvious
vein
of
moral
allegory
and
from
this
latter
light
jekyll
and
hyde
seems
almost
the
vivid
metaphor
of
a
clever
preacher
you
must
imagine
you
know
that
i
condemn
the
powder
business
as
bad
in
itself
for
let
us
revert
for
a
moment
to
philosophy
man
is
a
sacrament
soul
manifested
under
the
form
of
body
and
art
has
to
deal
with
each
and
both
and
to
show
their
interaction
and
interdependence
the
most
perfect
form
of
literature
is
no
doubt
lyrical
poetry
which
is
one
might
say
almost
pure
idea
art
with
scarcely
an
alloy
of
artifice
expressed
in
magic
words
in
the
voice
of
music
in
a
word
a
perfect
lyric
such
as
keats
belle
dame
sans
mercy
is
pure
soul
a
spirit
with
the
luminous
body
of
melody
but
in
our
age
at
all
events
a
prose
romance
must
put
on
a
grosser
and
more
material
envelope
than
this
it
must
have
incident
corporeity
relation
to
material
things
and
all
these
will
occupy
a
considerable
part
of
the
whole
to
a
certain
extent
then
the
idea
must
be
materialised
but
still
it
must
always
shine
through
the
fleshly
vestment
the
body
must
never
be
mere
body
but
always
the
body
of
the
spirit
existing
to
conceal
and
yet
to
manifest
the
spirit
and
here
it
seems
to
me
that
mr
stevenson
story
breaks
down
the
transformation
of
jekyll
into
hyde
is
solely
material
as
you
read
it
without
artistic
significance
it
is
simply
an
astounding
incident
and
not
an
outward
sign
of
an
inward
mystery
as
for
the
possible
allegory
i
have
too
much
respect
for
mr
stevenson
as
an
artificer
to
think
that
he
would
regard
this
element
as
anything
but
a
very
grave
defect
allegory
as
poe
so
well
observed
is
always
a
literary
vice
and
we
are
only
able
to
enjoy
the
pilgrim
progress
by
forgetting
that
the
allegory
exists
yes
that
seems
to
me
the
of
jekyll
and
hyde
the
conception
has
been
badly
realised
and
by
badly
i
do
not
mean
clumsily
because
from
the
logical
literal
standpoint
the
plot
and
the
construction
are
marvels
of
cleverness
but
i
mean
inartistically
ecstasy
which
as
we
have
settled
is
the
synonym
of
art
gave
birth
to
the
idea
but
immediately
abandoned
it
to
artifice
and
to
artifice
only
instead
of
presiding
over
and
inspiring
every
further
step
in
plot
in
construction
and
in
style
all
this
may
seem
to
you
very
and
but
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
the
true
account
of
the
matter
and
perhaps
you
may
realise
my
theory
better
if
i
draw
out
that
analogy
of
translation
which
i
suggested
i
think
a
few
minutes
ago
i
was
passing
along
new
oxford
street
the
other
day
and
i
happened
to
look
into
a
shop
which
displays
bibles
in
all
languages
and
i
glanced
at
the
french
version
open
at
the
seventh
chapter
of
the
book
of
proverbs
i
saw
the
words
un
jeune
homme
dépourvu
de
bon
sens
and
then
lower
down
comme
un
bœuf
à
la
boucherie
and
it
was
some
considerable
time
before
i
realised
that
these
phrases
translated
a
young
man
void
of
understanding
and
as
an
ox
goeth
to
the
slaughter
now
you
notice
that
these
are
in
every
way
commonplace
examples
there
is
nothing
extraordinarily
poetical
in
either
phrase
as
it
stands
in
the
authorised
version
i
might
have
made
the
contrast
much
more
violent
by
choosing
a
passage
from
the
song
of
songs
or
ecclesiastes
and
i
wonder
how
therefore
with
angels
and
archangels
would
go
into
french
but
is
the
gulf
astounding
between
void
of
understanding
and
dépourvu
de
bon
sens
yet
the
meaning
of
the
french
is
really
the
same
as
the
meaning
of
the
english
logically
i
should
think
the
two
phrases
are
exactly
equivalent
and
yet
well
we
know
perfectly
well
that
dépourvu
de
bon
sens
in
no
way
renders
that
noble
and
austere
simplicity
that
we
reverence
in
the
english
text
now
i
think
you
ought
to
see
what
i
have
been
trying
to
express
about
the
gulf
that
may
open
always
between
the
conception
and
the
plot
or
story
that
does
divide
the
conception
from
the
plot
of
jekyll
and
hyde
of
course
the
analogy
is
not
perfect
because
the
that
yawns
between
the
unformulated
idea
and
the
formulated
plot
between
pure
ecstasy
and
ecstasy
artifice
is
much
vaster
than
the
distinction
between
english
and
french
indeed
between
the
two
former
there
is
almost
or
altogether
the
difference
of
the
infinite
and
the
finite
of
soul
and
body
still
you
see
how
a
book
is
a
rendering
a
translation
of
an
idea
and
how
a
very
fine
idea
may
be
embodied
in
a
very
mechanical
plot
you
remember
the
socialist
and
baroness
novel
that
we
were
talking
about
the
other
night
we
placed
it
outside
of
literature
firstly
and
chiefly
because
it
was
not
based
on
ecstasy
on
an
idea
of
any
kind
and
secondly
and
by
way
of
consequence
because
in
its
execution
and
detail
it
was
so
thoroughly
insignificant
because
it
played
hamlet
with
the
part
of
the
prince
omitted
now
i
think
that
it
is
strong
evidence
of
the
soundness
of
my
literary
theory
that
we
are
enabled
by
it
to
take
two
books
so
utterly
dissimilar
in
manner
and
method
in
story
and
treatment
and
to
judge
them
both
by
the
same
scale
for
this
is
what
it
really
comes
to
we
say
that
the
tragic
comedians
is
not
literature
because
it
simply
tells
of
facts
without
their
significance
because
it
deals
with
the
outward
show
and
not
with
the
inward
spirit
because
it
is
accidental
and
not
essential
and
in
just
the
same
way
we
say
that
jekyll
and
hyde
its
conception
apart
is
not
literature
inasmuch
as
it
too
has
the
body
of
a
story
without
the
soul
of
a
story
the
incident
the
fact
without
the
inward
thing
of
which
the
fact
is
a
symbol
for
if
you
will
consider
the
matter
you
will
see
that
a
fact
fact
has
no
existence
in
art
at
all
it
is
not
the
business
to
make
us
a
likeness
of
a
tree
or
a
rock
it
is
his
business
to
communicate
to
us
an
emotion
an
ecstasy
if
you
please
and
that
he
may
do
so
he
uses
a
tree
or
a
rock
as
a
symbol
a
word
in
his
language
of
colour
and
form
it
is
not
the
business
of
the
sculptor
to
chisel
likenesses
of
men
in
marble
the
human
form
is
to
him
also
a
symbol
which
stands
for
an
idea
in
the
same
manner
it
is
not
the
business
of
the
literary
artist
to
describe
facts
real
or
imaginary
in
words
he
is
possessed
with
an
idea
which
he
symbolises
by
incident
by
a
story
of
men
and
women
and
things
he
is
possessed
let
us
say
by
the
idea
of
love
then
he
must
write
a
story
of
lovers
but
he
must
never
forget
that
and
his
actual
lovers
in
the
tale
with
their
social
positions
their
whims
and
fancies
their
sayings
and
doings
are
only
of
consequence
in
the
degree
that
they
symbolise
the
universal
human
passion
which
in
its
turn
is
a
copy
of
certain
eternal
and
ineffable
things
if
and
do
do
this
then
they
are
nothing
and
worse
than
nothing
so
far
as
art
is
concerned
but
my
tree
is
like
a
tree
says
the
dull
painter
and
my
anatomy
is
faultless
says
the
bad
sculptor
and
my
characters
are
says
the
novelist
and
one
can
apply
exactly
the
same
reasoning
to
mr
stevenson
ingenious
story
i
do
not
know
whether
there
is
or
has
been
or
will
be
a
salt
in
existence
which
can
turn
a
man
into
another
person
that
is
of
not
the
slightest
consequence
to
the
argument
the
result
of
the
powder
as
it
is
described
in
the
book
is
an
incident
and
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
critical
judgment
whether
the
incident
is
true
or
false
probable
or
improbable
the
only
point
absolutely
the
only
point
is
this
is
the
incident
significant
or
insignificant
is
it
related
for
its
own
sake
or
is
it
posited
because
it
is
a
sign
a
symbol
a
word
which
veils
and
reveals
the
artist
ecstasy
and
inspiration
the
socialist
fell
in
love
with
the
baroness
it
is
true
you
say
it
really
happened
so
in
germany
some
years
ago
but
in
the
book
it
is
insignificant
the
doctor
took
the
powder
and
became
another
man
it
is
probably
untrue
but
it
is
also
insignificant
and
to
the
critic
of
art
in
literature
the
one
incident
stands
precisely
on
the
same
footing
as
the
other
and
do
you
know
i
am
glad
i
have
made
this
comparison
between
jekyll
and
hyde
and
the
tragic
comedians
because
it
has
struck
me
that
what
i
have
been
saying
about
the
essential
element
of
all
literature
might
be
open
to
very
grave
misunderstanding
i
have
been
insisting
with
reiteration
that
must
have
tired
you
that
there
is
only
one
test
by
which
literature
may
be
distinguished
from
mere
reading
matter
and
that
that
test
is
summed
up
in
the
word
ecstasy
and
then
we
admitted
a
whole
string
of
synonyms
desire
of
the
unknown
sense
of
the
unknown
rapture
adoration
mystery
wonder
withdrawal
from
the
common
life
and
i
daresay
i
have
used
many
other
phrases
in
the
same
sense
without
giving
you
any
special
warning
that
it
was
our
old
friend
again
in
a
new
guise
but
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
that
with
all
this
wealth
of
synonyms
i
may
not
have
made
my
meaning
perfectly
clear
for
example
while
i
was
laying
down
the
law
about
dr
jekyll
powder
and
its
effects
you
might
have
interrupted
me
with
the
remark
but
i
thought
you
said
the
sense
of
wonder
was
characteristic
of
literature
and
surely
the
change
from
jekyll
into
hyde
is
extremely
wonderful
or
again
when
i
was
belauding
the
odyssey
dwelling
on
the
voyage
of
ulysses
amongst
strange
peoples
you
might
have
put
in
some
modern
tale
of
strange
adventure
and
requested
me
to
distinguish
between
the
two
to
justify
my
praise
of
the
old
and
rejection
of
the
new
and
we
have
mentioned
books
always
i
think
with
a
certain
of
contempt
but
books
usually
deal
with
religion
and
religion
and
adoration
are
almost
synonymous
and
so
one
could
go
on
with
the
list
making
out
on
our
premises
with
our
own
test
a
plausible
case
for
books
which
we
know
very
well
are
neither
literature
nor
anything
remotely
approaching
it
and
that
would
look
rather
like
the
collapse
of
our
literary
case
would
it
well
the
solution
of
the
difficulty
seems
to
me
to
be
sought
for
in
the
remarks
i
was
making
just
now
about
facts
in
art
i
said
you
remember
that
in
art
facts
as
facts
have
no
existence
at
all
facts
incidents
plots
simply
form
the
artistic
speech
its
mode
of
expression
or
medium
and
if
there
is
no
idea
behind
the
facts
then
you
have
no
longer
language
but
gibberish
just
as
language
is
made
up
of
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
arranged
in
significant
words
and
sentences
so
is
the
artistic
language
made
up
of
plots
incidents
sentences
which
are
informed
with
significance
if
i
heap
up
letters
of
the
alphabet
and
arrange
them
in
an
arbitrary
collocation
without
meaning
i
am
forming
gibberish
and
not
a
language
and
so
if
i
pepper
my
pages
with
extraordinary
incidents
without
attaching
to
them
any
significance
i
am
writing
it
may
be
an
exciting
absorbing
interesting
book
but
i
am
not
making
literature
indeed
some
of
the
books
that
might
be
mentioned
in
this
connection
remind
me
of
a
man
swearing
he
uses
the
holiest
names
but
he
does
so
in
such
a
manner
that
he
excites
not
reverence
and
awe
but
disgust
and
repulsion
tell
the
bare
plot
of
the
odyssey
to
one
of
these
writers
and
hint
that
it
might
be
made
into
a
successful
christmas
book
for
boys
and
he
will
produce
you
a
book
which
will
contain
the
and
calypso
and
the
cyclops
but
which
will
have
just
the
same
relation
to
literature
as
blasphemy
bears
to
the
liturgy
that
seems
to
me
the
explanation
one
must
say
again
that
mere
incident
is
nothing
that
it
only
becomes
something
when
it
is
a
symbol
of
an
interior
meaning
and
turning
this
maxim
inside
out
as
it
were
we
shall
sometimes
find
that
a
book
which
seems
on
the
surface
to
be
reading
matter
is
really
literature
and
incidents
apparently
insignificant
may
turn
out
on
a
closer
examination
to
be
significant
and
symbolic
in
a
very
high
degree
so
i
do
think
our
literary
criterion
is
in
any
way
invalidated
by
the
occurrence
of
surprising
incidents
in
very
worthless
books
look
at
mr
isaacs
for
example
in
a
sense
it
is
a
wonderful
book
inasmuch
as
it
contains
incidents
which
are
far
removed
from
common
experience
but
you
have
only
to
read
it
to
discover
that
the
author
had
not
been
visited
by
any
inspiration
of
the
unseen
one
may
trace
some
acquaintance
with
theosophical
literature
but
not
even
the
dimmest
vision
of
the
other
things
the
other
things
ah
that
is
another
synonym
but
who
can
furnish
a
precise
definition
of
the
indefinable
they
are
sometimes
in
the
song
of
a
bird
sometimes
in
the
scent
of
a
flower
sometimes
in
the
whirl
of
a
london
street
sometimes
hidden
under
a
great
lonely
hill
some
of
us
seek
them
with
most
hope
and
the
fullest
assurance
in
the
sacring
of
the
mass
others
receive
tidings
through
the
sound
of
music
in
the
colour
of
a
picture
in
the
shining
form
of
a
statue
in
the
meditation
of
eternal
truth
do
you
know
that
i
can
never
hear
a
jangling
contending
with
the
roar
of
traffic
without
the
tears
not
of
feeling
but
of
emotion
coming
to
my
eyes
and
that
instance
it
is
grotesque
enough
reminds
me
that
i
think
i
have
an
explanation
of
another
puzzle
that
has
often
perplexed
me
and
i
daresay
has
perplexed
you
do
you
remember
the
books
that
you
read
when
you
were
a
boy
i
can
think
of
stories
that
i
read
long
ago
i
have
forgotten
the
very
names
of
them
that
filled
me
with
emotions
that
i
recognised
afterwards
as
purely
artistic
the
sorriest
pirate
the
most
wretchedly
concealed
treasure
poor
captain
mayne
reid
at
his
boldest
gave
me
then
the
sensations
that
i
now
search
for
in
the
odyssey
or
in
the
thought
of
it
and
i
looked
into
some
of
these
shabby
old
tales
years
afterwards
and
wondered
how
on
earth
i
had
managed
to
penetrate
into
faëry
lands
forlorn
through
such
miserable
stucco
portals
and
you
you
say
extracted
somehow
or
other
from
harrison
ainsworth
lancashire
witches
that
essence
of
the
unknown
that
you
now
find
in
poe
and
i
expect
that
everybody
who
loves
literature
could
gather
similar
recollections
well
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
solve
the
problem
by
saying
that
the
emotions
of
children
are
of
no
consequence
and
do
count
but
then
i
do
think
that
proposition
is
true
i
think
on
the
contrary
that
children
especially
young
children
before
they
have
been
defiled
by
the
horrors
of
education
possess
the
artistic
emotion
in
remarkable
purity
that
they
reproduce
in
a
measure
the
primitive
man
before
he
was
defiled
artistically
by
the
horrors
of
civilisation
the
ecstasy
of
the
artist
is
but
a
recollection
a
remnant
from
the
childish
vision
and
the
child
undoubtedly
looks
at
the
world
through
magic
casements
but
you
see
all
this
is
unconscious
or
subconscious
to
a
less
degree
it
is
so
in
later
life
and
artists
are
rare
simply
because
it
is
their
almost
impossible
task
to
translate
the
emotion
of
the
into
the
speech
of
consciousness
and
as
you
may
sometimes
see
children
uttering
their
conceptions
in
words
that
are
nonsense
or
next
door
to
it
so
nonsense
or
at
any
rate
very
poor
stuff
suffices
with
them
to
summon
up
the
vision
from
the
depths
of
the
soul
suppose
we
could
catch
a
genius
at
the
age
of
nine
or
ten
and
request
him
to
utter
what
he
felt
the
boy
would
speak
or
write
rubbish
and
in
the
same
way
you
would
find
that
he
read
rubbish
and
that
it
excited
in
him
an
ineffable
joy
and
ecstasy
coleridge
was
a
bluecoat
boy
when
he
read
the
poems
of
william
lisle
bowles
and
admired
them
to
enthusiasm
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
at
some
early
period
poe
had
been
enraptured
by
mrs
radcliffe
and
we
know
how
burns
founded
himself
on
fergusson
when
men
are
young
the
inward
ecstasy
the
red
powder
of
projection
is
of
such
efficacy
and
virtue
that
the
grossest
and
vilest
matter
is
transmuted
for
them
into
pure
gold
glistering
and
glorious
as
the
sun
the
child
and
with
him
you
may
link
all
primitive
and
childlike
people
approaches
books
and
pictures
just
as
he
approaches
nature
itself
and
life
and
a
wonderful
vision
appears
where
many
of
us
can
only
see
the
common
and
insignificant
but
all
this
has
been
a
digression
it
has
come
by
the
way
in
a
talk
about
worthless
and
insignificant
books
but
i
think
that
we
should
by
this
time
have
brought
our
testing
apparatus
into
working
order
we
should
be
able
to
criticise
any
given
book
on
some
ground
or
principle
not
on
the
rule
of
thumb
of
it
sent
me
to
sleep
or
it
kept
me
awake
and
i
think
that
what
i
have
already
remarked
about
the
subconscious
element
in
literature
should
have
answered
that
question
about
books
with
a
purpose
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
believe
that
they
are
mostly
trash
but
it
is
not
a
case
for
reasoning
you
must
test
each
book
by
itself
mr
stevenson
was
i
believe
an
artist
at
heart
but
we
have
seen
how
the
artificer
overcame
the
artist
in
jekyll
and
hyde
and
in
like
manner
there
have
been
cases
of
people
who
were
artificers
and
even
preachers
at
heart
who
were
forced
to
succumb
to
the
concealed
subconscious
artist
when
pen
touched
paper
for
example
first
logically
analyze
lycidas
you
will
be
disgusted
just
as
dr
johnson
who
had
no
analysis
but
the
logical
was
disgusted
forget
your
logic
your
and
read
it
again
as
poetry
you
will
acknowledge
the
presence
of
an
amazing
masterpiece
an
unimportant
lament
over
an
unimportant
personage
constructed
on
an
affected
plan
full
of
acrid
puritanical
declamation
and
abuse
wantonly
absurd
with
its
mixture
of
the
nymphs
and
st
peter
it
is
not
only
wretched
in
plan
but
clumsy
in
construction
the
artifice
is
atrocious
and
it
is
also
perfect
beauty
it
is
the
very
soul
set
to
music
its
austere
and
exquisite
rapture
thrills
one
so
that
i
could
almost
say
he
who
understands
the
mystery
and
the
beauty
of
lycidas
understands
also
the
final
and
eternal
secret
of
art
and
life
and
man
iv
do
you
know
that
when
we
last
talked
the
whole
evening
went
by
or
at
least
i
think
so
without
my
saying
anything
about
pickwick
i
hope
you
noted
the
omission
in
your
diary
if
you
keep
one
because
i
find
it
difficult
to
talk
much
about
literature
without
drawing
some
illustration
from
that
very
notable
and
curious
and
unappreciated
book
yes
i
maintain
the
justice
of
the
last
epithet
in
spite
of
circulation
in
spite
of
popularity
and
in
spite
of
pickwick
you
may
like
a
book
very
much
and
read
it
three
times
a
year
without
appreciating
it
and
if
a
great
book
is
really
popular
it
is
sure
to
owe
its
popularity
to
entirely
wrong
reasons
there
are
people
you
know
who
study
homer
every
day
because
he
throws
so
much
light
on
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
ancients
and
if
a
book
of
our
own
time
is
both
great
and
popular
you
may
be
sure
that
it
is
loved
for
its
most
peccant
parts
just
as
nine
people
out
of
ten
will
recall
the
raven
and
the
bells
if
the
poetry
of
edgar
allan
poe
is
mentioned
after
all
i
need
have
excused
myself
for
my
constant
references
to
dickens
masterpiece
since
i
have
already
informed
you
that
like
coleridge
i
love
a
cyclical
mode
of
discoursing
and
i
honestly
think
that
if
you
want
to
understand
something
about
the
mysteries
or
the
fine
arts
which
are
the
expression
of
the
mysteries
it
is
the
only
way
a
proposition
in
euclid
is
demonstrated
and
done
with
since
nothing
can
be
added
to
a
mathematical
proof
but
literature
is
different
it
is
and
and
variable
always
you
can
consider
it
in
ways
from
standpoints
and
from
judgments
each
of
which
will
be
true
and
perfect
in
itself
and
yet
each
will
supplement
the
other
two
or
three
weeks
ago
i
think
i
tried
to
show
you
what
a
complex
organism
any
given
book
reveals
if
one
examines
it
with
a
little
attention
and
if
one
specimen
be
so
curiously
and
intricately
fashioned
you
may
imagine
the
complexity
of
the
whole
subject
but
i
have
a
more
particular
reason
for
turning
once
more
to
the
posthumous
papers
we
have
noted
that
that
which
at
first
sight
seems
significant
may
turn
out
to
be
insignificant
and
i
think
that
in
passing
i
hinted
that
the
reverse
was
sometimes
the
case
very
good
and
the
especial
instance
that
is
in
my
mind
is
the
enormous
capacity
for
strong
drink
exhibited
by
mr
pickwick
and
all
his
friends
and
associates
of
course
you
noticed
it
perhaps
you
have
thought
it
a
nuisance
and
a
blemish
from
the
artistic
standpoint
just
as
many
good
people
have
found
it
a
nuisance
and
a
blemish
from
the
temperance
or
teetotal
standpoint
you
may
have
felt
quite
certain
that
a
set
of
men
who
were
always
drinking
brandy
and
water
and
strong
ale
and
and
madeira
who
constantly
drank
a
great
deal
too
much
of
each
and
all
of
these
things
would
be
extremely
unpleasant
companions
in
private
life
i
daresay
you
have
been
thankful
that
you
never
knew
mr
pickwick
or
any
of
his
followers
you
know
i
expect
by
personal
experience
that
a
man
whose
daily
life
is
a
pilgrimage
from
one
whiskey
bar
to
another
is
in
most
cases
an
extremely
tedious
and
unprofitable
companion
and
it
is
undeniable
that
the
pickwickians
rather
made
opportunities
for
brandy
and
water
than
avoided
them
and
in
an
indirect
manner
you
feel
that
all
this
makes
you
like
the
book
less
but
i
can
no
more
miss
an
opportunity
of
digression
than
mr
pickwick
could
keep
on
the
coach
if
there
were
a
chance
of
drinking
his
favourite
beverage
do
you
know
that
there
are
really
people
who
make
their
liking
or
disliking
of
the
characters
the
criterion
of
literature
of
romances
i
mean
we
touched
on
this
some
time
ago
and
i
remember
saying
that
in
the
case
of
such
secondary
books
as
jane
austen
and
thackeray
it
was
permissible
enough
to
go
where
one
was
best
amused
that
one
had
a
right
to
say
yes
the
artifice
may
be
the
better
here
but
the
characters
are
much
more
amusing
there
and
i
had
rather
talk
to
the
cosmopolitan
whose
manners
are
now
and
then
a
little
to
seek
than
to
the
maiden
lady
in
the
village
whose
decorum
is
so
unexceptionable
but
i
confess
that
at
the
time
it
had
not
dawned
upon
me
that
there
are
people
who
try
to
judge
fine
art
the
true
literature
on
the
same
grounds
i
believe
however
that
such
is
the
case
i
believe
indeed
that
the
egregious
voltaire
was
dimly
moved
by
some
such
feeling
when
he
wrote
his
famous
criticism
of
the
prophet
habakkuk
what
he
must
have
said
to
himself
would
they
think
in
the
of
a
man
who
talked
like
this
and
the
everlasting
mountains
were
scattered
the
perpetual
hills
did
bow
his
ways
are
everlasting
evidently
habakkuk
could
never
hope
for
a
second
invitation
and
he
wrote
rubbish
and
i
believe
as
i
said
that
there
are
many
people
who
more
or
less
unconsciously
judge
literature
by
this
measure
by
asking
would
these
people
be
pleasant
to
meet
would
one
like
to
hear
this
kind
of
thing
in
one
and
this
is
well
enough
with
secondary
books
since
they
contain
nothing
but
characters
and
incidents
and
scenes
and
facts
but
it
is
by
no
means
well
in
literature
in
which
as
we
found
out
all
these
things
are
symbols
words
of
a
language
used
not
for
themselves
but
because
they
are
significant
remember
our
old
definition
ecstasy
the
withdrawal
the
standing
apart
from
common
life
and
you
will
see
that
we
may
almost
reverse
this
popular
method
of
judgment
and
turn
it
into
another
test
or
rather
another
way
of
putting
the
test
of
art
for
if
literature
be
a
kind
of
withdrawal
from
the
common
atmosphere
of
life
we
shall
naturally
expect
to
find
its
utterance
both
in
matter
and
manner
wholly
unsuitable
for
the
or
the
street
and
its
characters
persons
whom
we
can
not
imagine
ourselves
associating
with
on
pleasant
or
comfortable
terms
neither
you
nor
i
would
be
very
happy
on
ulysses
boat
we
should
soon
become
irritated
with
don
quixote
we
should
hardly
feel
at
home
with
sir
galahad
it
is
true
that
all
the
good
there
is
in
men
is
this
that
at
rare
intervals
in
certain
lonely
moments
of
exaltation
they
do
feel
for
the
time
a
faint
stirring
of
the
beautiful
within
them
and
they
would
adventure
on
the
quest
of
the
graal
but
as
you
know
few
of
us
are
saints
fewer
perhaps
are
men
of
genius
we
are
sunk
for
the
most
part
of
our
days
in
the
common
life
and
our
care
is
for
the
body
and
for
the
things
of
the
body
for
the
street
and
the
and
not
for
the
perpetual
solitary
hills
so
you
see
that
if
you
read
a
book
and
can
say
of
the
characters
in
it
i
wish
i
knew
them
there
is
very
strong
reason
to
suspect
that
the
book
in
question
is
not
literature
though
it
may
well
be
a
pleasant
picture
of
pleasant
people
yes
i
was
expecting
that
question
i
should
have
been
sorry
if
your
sense
of
humour
had
prompted
you
to
ask
whether
the
drinking
of
too
much
constituted
a
withdrawal
from
the
common
life
a
profound
and
lonely
ecstasy
but
do
you
remember
that
when
we
were
discussing
pickwick
before
and
comparing
it
with
the
odyssey
i
suddenly
deserted
homer
and
brought
in
sophocles
i
think
i
contrasted
very
briefly
the
education
of
the
dramatist
with
the
education
of
the
romance
writer
the
london
of
the
and
with
the
city
of
the
violet
crown
the
fate
of
him
ἀεὶ
διὰ
λαμπροτάτου
βαίνοντος
ἁβρῶς
αἰθέρος
with
that
of
the
other
who
tried
to
find
the
way
through
the
evil
and
hideous
london
fog
well
you
might
have
been
inclined
to
ask
why
sophocles
but
do
you
remember
for
whose
festivals
in
whose
honour
the
greek
wrote
his
dramas
and
his
choral
songs
it
was
the
god
of
wine
who
was
worshipped
and
invoked
at
the
dionysiaca
in
the
praise
of
dionysus
the
chorus
sang
and
danced
about
the
altar
and
all
the
drama
arose
from
the
celebration
of
the
bacchic
mysteries
so
you
get
i
think
a
pretty
fair
proportion
as
the
athens
of
sophocles
is
to
the
cockneydom
of
dickens
so
is
the
cult
of
dionysus
to
the
cult
of
cold
punch
and
brandy
and
water
the
interior
meaning
is
in
each
case
the
same
the
artistic
expression
has
lamentably
deteriorated
in
the
degree
that
the
artistic
atmosphere
on
the
banks
of
fleet
ditch
the
mother
of
dead
dogs
was
inferior
to
the
artistic
atmosphere
on
the
banks
of
the
ilissus
i
expect
you
have
gathered
from
all
this
talk
the
point
i
want
to
make
that
the
brandy
and
water
and
punch
business
in
pickwick
which
at
first
sight
seems
trivial
and
insignificant
and
even
disgusting
is
in
fact
full
of
the
highest
significance
do
you
notice
the
insistence
with
which
the
writer
dwells
on
drinking
the
unction
and
enthusiasm
with
which
he
describes
it
we
have
admitted
the
poverty
of
the
materials
with
which
dickens
works
and
of
course
it
would
be
as
idle
to
expect
him
to
write
a
choral
song
in
honour
of
dionysus
as
it
would
be
to
expect
him
to
write
in
greek
he
expressed
himself
as
best
he
could
in
the
language
that
is
with
the
incidents
and
in
the
atmosphere
that
he
knew
but
there
can
be
no
possible
doubt
as
to
his
meaning
in
a
word
i
absolutely
identify
the
brandy
and
water
scenes
with
the
bacchic
cultus
and
all
that
it
implies
this
is
a
little
too
much
for
you
is
it
well
let
us
take
another
book
the
gargantua
and
pantagruel
you
know
it
well
and
i
have
only
to
remind
you
of
the
name
to
remind
you
that
as
pickwick
has
been
said
to
reek
with
brandy
and
water
so
does
rabelais
assuredly
reek
of
wine
the
history
begins
grandgousier
estoit
bon
raillard
en
son
temps
aimant
à
boire
net
it
ends
with
the
oracle
of
the
holy
bottle
with
the
word
un
mot
panomphée
celebré
et
entendu
de
toutes
nations
et
nous
signifie
and
i
refer
you
to
the
allocution
of
bacbuc
the
priestess
of
the
bottle
at
large
by
wine
she
says
is
man
made
divine
and
i
may
say
that
if
you
have
not
got
the
key
to
these
rabelaisian
riddles
much
of
the
value
the
highest
value
of
the
book
is
lost
to
you
you
know
how
they
drink
those
strange
figures
the
giants
and
their
followers
you
know
the
aroma
of
the
vintage
the
odour
of
the
wine
vat
that
fills
all
those
marvellous
and
enigmatic
pages
and
i
tell
you
that
here
again
i
recognise
the
same
signs
as
in
pickwick
the
same
music
as
that
of
the
dithyrambic
choruses
in
honour
of
dionysus
which
were
eventually
amplified
into
that
magnificent
literary
product
the
greek
drama
and
if
we
wish
to
penetrate
the
secret
we
must
not
forget
the
hebrew
psalmist
with
his
meus
inebrians
quam
præclarus
and
remember
too
if
you
feel
inclined
to
shudder
at
the
that
the
words
which
i
have
just
quoted
might
be
rendered
how
splendid
is
this
cup
of
wine
that
makes
me
drunk
and
we
may
say
that
in
a
manner
poor
dickens
did
so
render
them
since
as
i
have
reminded
you
he
belonged
after
the
flesh
to
the
camden
town
of
the
and
was
forced
to
use
its
unbeautiful
dialect
because
he
knew
no
other
and
after
all
then
what
does
this
bacchic
cultus
mean
we
have
seen
that
under
various
disguises
the
one
spirit
appeared
in
greece
in
the
france
of
the
renaissance
and
in
victorian
england
and
that
in
each
instance
there
is
an
apparent
glorification
of
drunkenness
the
greeks
indeed
a
sober
people
by
necessity
as
all
southerners
are
impersonated
the
genius
of
intoxication
and
made
excessive
drinking
as
it
would
seem
an
elaborate
religion
with
rites
and
festivals
and
mysteries
the
tourainian
whose
personal
habit
was
that
not
of
a
drunkard
but
of
a
learned
physician
and
restorer
of
ancient
letters
who
probably
drank
very
much
in
the
manner
of
the
good
curé
i
once
knew
my
god
he
said
to
me
after
the
third
small
glass
of
small
white
wine
is
a
veritable
debauch
has
on
the
face
of
it
dedicated
all
his
enormous
book
to
the
same
cause
so
that
to
read
pantagruel
is
like
walking
through
a
french
village
in
the
vintage
season
when
the
whole
world
as
zola
unpleasantly
and
nastily
expresses
it
pue
le
raisin
thirdly
dickens
who
loved
to
talk
of
concocting
and
left
it
when
concocted
to
be
drunk
by
his
guests
shows
us
mr
pickwick
dead
drunk
in
the
and
for
a
final
touch
of
apparent
absurdity
you
remember
that
the
dionysus
myth
represents
wine
as
a
civilising
influence
you
may
well
think
of
the
at
the
corner
and
ask
yourself
how
strong
drink
can
contribute
to
civilisation
well
that
is
in
very
brief
outline
the
problem
and
the
puzzle
and
i
may
say
at
once
that
to
the
literalist
the
rationalist
the
materialist
critic
the
problem
is
quite
insoluble
but
to
you
and
me
who
do
not
end
in
any
kind
of
the
enigma
will
not
be
quite
so
hopeless
let
us
get
back
to
our
maxim
that
in
literature
facts
and
incidents
are
not
present
for
their
own
sake
but
as
symbols
as
words
of
the
language
of
art
it
will
follow
then
that
the
incidents
of
the
dionysus
myth
the
incidents
of
pantagruel
and
pickwick
are
not
to
be
taken
literally
but
symbolically
we
are
not
to
conclude
that
the
greeks
were
a
race
of
drunkards
or
that
rabelais
and
dickens
preached
habitual
excess
in
drink
as
the
highest
virtue
we
are
to
conclude
that
both
the
ancient
people
and
the
modern
writers
recognised
ecstasy
as
the
supreme
gift
and
state
of
man
and
that
they
chose
the
vine
and
the
juice
of
the
vine
as
the
most
beautiful
and
significant
symbol
of
that
power
which
withdraws
a
man
from
the
common
life
and
the
common
consciousness
and
taking
him
from
the
dust
of
the
earth
sets
him
in
high
places
in
the
eternal
world
of
ideas
and
after
all
i
can
not
do
better
than
quote
at
length
the
sermon
of
bacbuc
priestess
of
the

si
avez

ce
qui
est
en
lettres
ioniques
escrit
dessus
la
porte
du
temple
vous
avez
peu
entendre
vin
est
verité
cachée
you
see
how
that
passage
lights
up
the
whole
book
and
you
see
what
rabelais
meant
in
the
prologue
to
the
first
book
by
that
reference
to
certain
little
boxes
such
as
we
see
nowadays
in
apothecaries
shops
the
which
boxes
are
painted
on
the
outside
with
joyous
and
fantastic
figures
but
within
they
hold
rare
drugs
as
balm
ambergris
amomum
musk
civet
certain
stones
of
high
virtue
and
all
manner
of
precious
things
i
do
not
know
whether
you
have
read
any
of
our
english
commentators
on
rabelais
if
not
i
would
not
advise
you
to
do
so
unless
you
take
pleasure
in
futility
for
instance
they
take
the
passage
from
the
prologue
and
seeing
the
hint
that
something
is
concealed
try
by
some
complicated
chain
of
argument
to
show
that
rabelais
veiled
his
attacks
on
the
church
under
a
mask
of
wild
buffoonery
of
course
the
attacks
on
the
church
the
secondary
and
comparatively
unimportant
element
in
the
book
fairly
answering
to
the
attacks
on
books
of
chivalry
in
the
don
quixote
are
as
open
as
any
attack
can
well
be
and
anyone
who
finds
a
veil
drawn
between
rabelais
dislike
for
the
clergy
and
his
expression
of
it
must
have
a
very
singular
notion
of
what
constitutes
concealment
and
a
still
more
singular
misapprehension
of
the
which
make
and
shape
great
books
art
you
may
feel
quite
assured
proceeds
always
from
love
and
rapture
never
from
hatred
and
disdain
and
satire
of
every
kind
satire
is
eternally
condemned
to
that
gehenna
where
the
pamphlets
the
literature
of
the
subject
and
the
books
lie
all
together
in
don
quixote
one
perceives
that
cervantes
loved
the
romances
he
condemns
and
the
satire
is
therefore
and
one
may
say
does
his
book
little
harm
or
none
at
all
but
rabelais
had
been
harshly
treated
by
the
friars
and
his
consequent
his
very
violent
abuse
in
disaccord
with
the
eternal
melodies
which
may
be
discerned
in
pantagruel
noted
there
under
strange
symbols
yes
the
satire
in
rabelais
is
an
accident
which
one
has
to
accept
and
to
make
the
best
of
some
of
it
is
amusing
enough
joyous
and
fantastic
like
the
apes
and
owls
and
antiques
that
adorn
the
little
boxes
of
the
apothecaries
some
of
it
is
a
little
acrid
as
i
said
but
let
us
never
forget
that
the
essence
of
the
book
is
its
splendid
celebration
of
ecstasy
under
the
figure
of
the
vine
you
know
i
have
not
opened
the
door
i
have
only
put
the
key
into
your
hands
in
this
as
in
other
instances
there
are
things
which
strange
to
say
are
better
left
unsaid
and
this
no
doubt
rabelais
perceived
when
he
devised
his
symbolism
and
set
many
traps
in
the
paths
of
the
shallow
commentator
it
was
not
from
dread
of
the
consequences
of
attacking
the
clergy
that
he
devised
curious
veils
and
concealments
since
as
i
have
noted
his
hatred
of
the
church
is
quite
open
and
unconcealed
he
chose
the
method
of
symbolism
firstly
because
he
was
an
artist
and
symbolism
is
the
speech
of
art
and
secondly
because
the
high
truth
that
he
prophesied
was
not
and
is
not
fit
for
vulgar
ears
the
secret
places
of
the
human
nature
are
not
heedlessly
to
be
exposed
to
the
uninitiated
who
would
merely
profane
this
occult
knowledge
if
they
had
it
by
consequence
the
complete
works
of
rabelais
are
obtainable
in
holywell
street
and
many
seeking
the
libidinous
have
found
merely
the
tiresome
and
have
cursed
their
bargain
no
i
will
positively
say
no
more
the
key
is
in
your
hands
and
with
it
you
may
open
what
chambers
you
can
there
is
only
this
to
be
mentioned
that
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
be
afraid
with
any
amazement
should
mr
pickwick
overdose
of
milk
punch
prove
ultimately
a
clue
to
the
labyrinth
of
mystic
theology
there
are
however
one
or
two
minor
points
in
rabelais
that
may
be
worth
notice
i
might
you
know
analyze
it
as
i
attempted
to
analyze
don
quixote
there
is
in
gargantua
and
pantagruel
that
same
complexity
of
thought
and
construction
you
may
note
first
of
all
the
great
essence
which
is
common
to
these
masterpieces
as
to
all
literature
ecstasy
expressed
in
the
one
case
under
the
similitude
of
in
the
other
by
the
symbol
of
the
vine
then
in
rabelais
you
have
another
symbolism
of
ecstasy
the
shape
of
of
gross
exuberant
gaiety
expressing
itself
by
outrageous
tales
outrageous
words
by
a
very
cataract
of
obscenity
if
you
please
if
only
you
will
notice
how
the
obscenity
of
rabelais
transcends
the
obscenity
of
common
life
how
grossness
is
poured
out
in
a
sort
of
mad
torrent
in
a
frenzy
a
very
passion
of
the
unspeakable
then
thirdly
there
is
the
impression
one
collects
from
the
book
a
transfigured
picture
of
that
wonderful
age
there
is
the
note
of
the
vast
interminable
argument
of
the
schools
and
for
a
respond
the
clear
enchanted
voice
of
plato
there
is
the
vision
there
is
the
mystery
of
the
vast
gothic
quire
and
those
fair
ornate
and
smiling
rise
smiling
from
the
rich
banks
of
the
loire
and
the
vienne
the
old
tales
told
in
farmhouse
kitchens
in
the
chinonnais
the
exultation
of
the
new
learning
of
lost
beauty
recovered
the
joy
of
the
vintage
the
old
legends
the
ancient
turns
of
speech
the
new
style
and
manner
of
speaking
so
to
the
old
world
answers
the
new
then
one
has
the
satire
of
clergy
and
lawyers
the
criticism
of
life
analogous
as
i
said
with
much
that
is
in
cervantes
and
so
from
divers
elements
you
see
how
a
literary
masterpiece
is
made
into
a
whole
but
now
do
you
know
i
am
going
to
make
a
confession
you
have
heard
me
say
more
than
once
that
in
art
in
literature
properly
so
called
liking
and
disliking
count
for
nothing
we
have
understood
i
think
that
when
once
amusing
reading
matter
has
been
put
out
of
court
the
question
of
how
often
with
what
absorption
one
reads
a
work
of
art
matters
nothing
well
i
want
to
contradict
or
rather
to
modify
that
axiom
we
have
been
speaking
of
three
great
books
each
of
which
i
believe
firmly
to
be
true
literature
pickwick
don
quixote
and
pantagruel
here
is
my
confession
i
read
pickwick
say
once
a
year
don
quixote
once
every
three
years
while
i
read
rabelais
in
fragments
perhaps
once
in
six
years
you
might
suppose
that
i
have
indicated
the
order
of
merit
well
i
have
but
you
must
reverse
the
order
since
i
firmly
believe
that
pantagruel
is
the
finest
of
the
three
we
will
leave
dickens
out
of
account
since
we
are
agreed
that
though
the
message
was
that
of
angels
the
accent
and
the
speech
were
of
camden
town
he
that
is
to
say
approaches
most
nearly
to
the
common
life
to
the
common
passages
in
which
we
live
and
hence
he
naturally
pleases
us
the
most
in
our
ordinary
and
common
humours
but
of
the
other
two
i
confess
that
cervantes
pleases
me
much
the
more
the
vulgarity
of
dickens
is
absent
or
rather
it
is
concentrated
in
sancho
in
a
much
milder
form
than
that
of
pickwick
for
a
spanish
peasant
of
the
sixteenth
century
with
all
his
and
practical
reason
is
less
remote
from
beauty
than
the
retired
business
man
of
the
early
nineteenth
century
just
as
poor
mr
pickwick
an
honest
kindly
creature
is
vastly
superior
to
the
blatant
pretentious
swindlers
who
represent
the
city
in
our
day
but
cervantes
who
lacks
as
i
say
the
commonness
of
dickens
has
something
of
the
urbanity
the
cosmopolitanism
of
thackeray
he
is
to
a
certain
degree
a
colonel
newcome
of
his
time
but
he
has
seen
the
world
more
sagaciously
than
colonel
newcome
ever
could
so
while
rabelais
appals
me
with
his
extravagance
his
torrents
of
obscene
words
i
am
charmed
with
the
good
humoured
and
observant
companionship
of
cervantes
and
hence
i
conclude
that
pantagruel
is
the
finer
book
it
may
sound
paradoxical
to
say
so
but
do
you
see
that
the
very
of
rabelais
shows
a
further
remove
from
the
daily
round
a
purer
metal
less
tinged
with
the
personal
material
interest
than
don
quixote
mind
you
i
find
greater
deftness
a
finer
artifice
in
cervantes
who
i
think
expressed
his
conception
the
more
perfectly
but
i
think
that
the
conception
of
rabelais
the
higher
precisely
because
it
is
the
more
remote
look
at
the
pantagruel
consider
those
lists
that
more
than
frankness
that
ebullition
of
grossness
plainly
intentional
designed
it
is
either
the
merest
lunacy
or
else
it
is
sublime
do
you
remember
the
trite
saying
extremes
meet
do
you
perceive
that
when
a
certain
depth
has
been
passed
you
begin
to
ascend
into
the
heights
the
persian
poet
expresses
the
most
transcendental
secrets
of
the
divine
love
by
the
grossest
phrases
of
the
carnal
love
so
rabelais
soars
above
the
common
life
above
the
streets
and
the
gutter
by
going
far
lower
than
the
streets
and
the
gutter
he
brings
before
you
the
highest
by
positing
that
which
is
lower
than
the
lowest
and
if
you
have
the
prepared
initiated
mind
a
rabelaisian
list
is
the
best
preface
to
the
angelic
song
all
this
may
strike
you
as
extreme
paradox
but
it
has
the
disadvantage
of
being
true
and
perhaps
you
may
assure
yourself
of
its
truth
by
recollecting
the
converse
proposition
that
it
is
when
one
is
absorbed
in
the
highest
emotions
that
the
most
degrading
images
will
intrude
themselves
no
you
are
right
this
is
not
the
psychology
of
the
scientific
persons
who
write
on
the
subject
it
is
not
the
psychology
of
the
serious
novelists
of
those
who
write
the
annals
of
the
engaged
but
it
happens
to
be
the
psychology
of
man
i
do
know
that
very
much
can
be
made
of
the
signification
of
the
characters
in
pantagruel
as
i
hardly
think
that
rabelais
was
anxious
to
be
systematic
or
consistent
in
delineating
them
i
believe
that
there
are
two
reasons
for
the
gigantic
stature
of
pantagruel
or
perhaps
three
the
form
of
the
whole
story
came
from
popular
legends
about
a
giant
named
gargantua
and
that
is
the
first
and
least
important
reason
secondly
the
giant
conception
does
something
to
remove
the
book
from
common
experience
it
is
a
warning
you
to
expect
a
faithful
picture
of
life
but
rather
a
withdrawal
from
life
and
from
common
experience
and
you
are
in
a
position
to
appreciate
the
value
of
that
motive
since
i
have
never
ceased
from
telling
you
that
it
is
the
principal
motive
of
all
literature
and
thirdly
i
hesitate
and
doubt
but
nothing
more
whether
the
giant
pantagruel
he
who
is
all
thirst
and
ever
athirst
may
not
be
a
hint
of
the
stature
of
the
perfect
man
of
the
ideal
man
freed
from
the
bonds
of
the
common
life
and
common
appetites
having
only
the
eternal
thirst
for
the
eternal
vine
candidly
i
am
inclined
to
favour
this
view
but
only
as
a
private
interpretation
it
may
be
all
nonsense
and
i
shall
not
be
offended
or
surprised
if
you
can
prove
to
me
that
it
is
nonsense
but
have
you
noticed
how
pantagruel
is
at
once
the
most
important
and
the
least
important
figure
in
the
book
he
is
the
most
important
personage
he
is
the
hero
the
leader
the
son
of
the
king
the
giant
wiser
than
any
or
all
of
his
followers
formally
he
is
to
rabelais
that
which
don
quixote
is
to
cervantes
and
yet
actually
he
is
little
more
than
a
vague
tremendous
shadow
the
living
speaking
impressive
personages
are
frère
jean
and
panurge
who
occupy
the
stage
and
capture
our
attention
does
this
rather
suggest
to
you
the
part
played
by
the
real
man
in
life
itself
a
subordinate
unobtrusive
part
usually
hidden
very
often
by
an
exterior
which
bears
little
resemblance
to
the
true
man
within
you
know
coleridge
says
that
pantagruel
is
the
reason
panurge
the
understanding
the
pollarded
man
the
man
with
every
faculty
except
the
reason
i
scarcely
know
an
example
more
illustrative
of
the
distinction
between
the
two
rabelais
had
no
mode
of
speaking
the
truth
in
those
days
but
in
such
form
as
this
as
it
was
he
was
indebted
to
the
king
protection
for
his
life
i
must
cavil
at
the
last
sentence
in
which
coleridge
seems
to
hint
that
rabelais
was
in
danger
because
he
had
hinted
the
distinction
between
the
reason
and
the
understanding
with
all
respect
to
coleridge
rabelais
might
have
gone
to
the
limits
of
psychology
and
metaphysics
without
incurring
any
danger
he
was
threatened
on
account
of
his
very
open
satire
of
the
church
and
the
clergy
which
as
i
have
pointed
out
is
as
plain
spoken
as
satire
well
can
be
still
i
think
that
coleridge
using
the
technical
language
of
german
philosophy
had
a
glimpse
of
the
truth
and
mr
besant
remark
that
panurge
is
a
careful
portrait
of
a
man
without
a
soul
is
virtually
the
same
definition
in
another
terminology
as
i
have
already
said
i
do
think
that
rabelais
kept
his
characters
within
the
strict
limits
of
consistence
they
are
only
significant
perhaps
now
and
then
and
i
want
to
say
again
that
i
speak
under
correction
in
this
matter
not
feeling
at
all
sure
of
my
ground
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
pantagruel
panurge
and
the
monk
are
not
so
much
three
different
characters
as
the
representative
of
man
in
his
three
persons
frère
jean
is
perhaps
the
natural
man
the
healthy
animal
panurge
is
the
rational
man
and
pantagruel
as
i
said
is
the
spiritual
or
perfect
man
who
looms
gigantic
in
the
background
almost
invisible
and
yet
all
important
and
the
three
are
in
reality
one
if
i
may
apply
the
case
to
our
own
subject
i
may
say
that
while
pantagruel
conceives
the
idea
panurge
writes
the
book
and
brother
john
has
the
courage
to
take
it
to
the
publishers
the
first
is
the
artist
the
second
the
artificer
and
the
third
the
social
being
ready
to
battle
for
his
place
in
the
material
world
the
giant
is
always
calm
since
his
head
is
high
above
earth
nubes
et
but
the
other
two
have
to
face
the
compromises
of
life
and
suffer
its
defeats
all
this
may
be
purely
fantastical
and
at
any
rate
i
am
sure
that
anyone
who
knows
his
rabelais
could
pick
many
holes
in
my
interpretation
for
example
i
said
that
the
monk
was
the
healthy
animal
and
panurge
the
rational
man
but
there
are
occasions
when
panurge
assumes
the
character
of
the
unhealthy
beast
the
hybrid
creature
of
the
greek
myth
who
uses
the
superior
human
artifice
for
ends
that
are
wholly
bestial
or
worse
than
bestial
still
is
this
a
valid
objection
are
there
not
such
men
in
life
itself
is
it
not
perhaps
the
peculiar
and
terrible
privilege
of
humanity
that
it
may
if
it
pleases
prostitute
its
most
holy
and
most
blessed
gifts
to
the
worst
and
most
horrible
uses
and
does
not
each
one
of
us
feel
that
potentially
at
all
events
there
is
such
a
being
within
him
not
yielded
to
perhaps
for
a
moment
yet
always
present
always
ready
to
assume
the
command
the
greatest
saints
we
are
told
have
suffered
the
most
fiery
temptations
in
other
words
pantagruel
is
always
attended
by
i
have
talked
once
or
twice
of
the
shadowy
companion
but
one
must
not
forget
that
there
is
the
muddy
companion
also
a
being
often
of
exquisite
wit
and
deep
understanding
but
given
to
evil
ways
if
one
do
not
hold
him
in
check
but
in
any
case
i
think
i
have
shown
that
the
pantagruel
is
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
efforts
of
the
human
mind
full
of
pantagruelism
and
that
word
stands
for
many
concealed
and
wonderful
mysteries
it
is
not
in
the
least
a
pleasant
or
a
or
even
an
interesting
book
i
think
that
when
one
knows
of
the
key
or
rather
of
the
keys
one
opens
the
pages
almost
with
a
sensation
of
dread
so
it
is
a
book
that
one
consults
at
long
intervals
because
it
is
only
at
rare
moments
that
a
man
can
bear
the
spectacle
of
his
own
naked
soul
and
a
vision
that
is
splendid
certainly
but
awful
also
in
its
constant
apposition
of
the
eternal
heights
and
the
eternal
depths
v
i
have
been
waiting
for
that
question
for
a
very
long
time
and
i
only
wonder
that
you
have
been
able
to
restrain
yourself
so
well
through
such
a
series
of
what
i
know
you
believe
to
be
paradoxes
though
i
have
assured
you
that
i
deal
merely
in
the
plainest
truth
but
after
all
your
question
is
quite
a
legitimate
one
and
i
remember
when
i
first
began
to
think
of
these
things
i
went
astray
simply
because
i
did
not
recognise
the
existence
of
the
difficulty
that
has
been
bothering
you
ever
since
that
talk
of
ours
about
the
sagesse
pantagrueline
et
and
perhaps
before
it
yes
i
will
put
the
question
in
its
plainest
crudest
form
and
i
will
make
you
ask
if
you
please
whether
charles
dickens
had
any
consciousness
of
the
interior
significance
of
the
strong
ale
and
brandy
and
water
which
he
caused
mr
pickwick
and
his
friends
to
consume
in
such
outrageous
quantities
it
sounds
plain
enough
and
simple
enough
does
it
and
yet
i
must
tell
you
that
to
answer
that
question
fairly
you
must
first
analyze
human
nature
and
i
remind
you
that
is
a
task
very
far
from
simple
man
sounds
a
very
simple
predicate
as
you
utter
it
you
imagine
that
you
understand
its
significance
perfectly
well
but
when
you
begin
to
refine
a
little
and
to
bring
in
distinctions
and
to
carry
propositions
to
their
legitimate
bounds
you
find
that
you
have
undertaken
the
definition
of
that
which
is
essentially
indefinite
and
probably
indefinable
and
after
all
we
need
not
pitch
on
this
term
or
on
that
there
is
no
need
to
select
man
as
offering
any
especial
difficulty
for
i
take
it
that
the
truth
is
that
all
human
knowledge
is
subject
to
the
same
disadvantage
the
same
doubts
and
reservations
exeunt
in
was
an
old
scholastic
maxim
and
the
only
people
who
have
always
a
plain
answer
for
a
plain
question
are
the
the
people
who
think
that
one
can
solve
the
enigma
of
the
universe
with
a
box
of
chemicals
but
all
this
is
a
caution
necessary
i
suppose
that
you
need
not
expect
me
to
give
you
a
plain
cut
and
dried
answer
to
your
question
whether
literature
is
a
conscious
production
or
in
more
particular
form
was
dickens
aware
that
by
he
meant
ecstasy
i
shall
ask
you
another
in
the
approved
scotch
manner
you
were
telling
me
that
as
you
came
along
this
evening
you
had
to
stop
for
five
minutes
at
the
corner
of
the
caledonian
road
to
watch
the
exquisite
grace
of
two
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
dancing
to
the
rattling
tune
of
a
you
spoke
of
the
charm
of
their
movements
some
of
them
i
fear
of
the
purely
æsthetic
delight
there
was
in
the
sight
of
young
girls
disguised
as
horrible
little
slatterns
leaping
and
dancing
as
young
girls
have
always
leapt
and
danced
i
suppose
from
the
time
of
the
onwards
well
but
do
you
suppose
that
this
charm
you
have
remarked
was
conscious
do
you
think
that
harriet
and
emily
realised
that
they
were
of
the
kin
of
the
ecstatic
dancers
of
all
time
that
they
were
beautiful
because
they
were
naturally
expressing
by
a
symbol
that
is
universal
the
universal
and
eternal
ecstasy
of
life
look
back
in
your
memory
for
illustrations
i
as
you
know
am
rather
the
enemy
of
facts
and
it
is
rarely
that
i
am
able
to
support
a
theory
by
a
systematic
of
instances
and
authorities
but
if
one
had
the
industry
and
energy
one
might
make
a
most
curious
history
of
the
dance
remember
the
hebrew
dances
of
religious
joy
of
ecstasy
in
its
highest
form
remember
that
strange
survival
of
the
choristers
dance
before
the
high
altar
in
spain
on
certain
solemn
feasts
a
survival
which
has
persisted
in
spite
of
the
strong
roman
influences
which
make
for
rigid
uniformity
think
of
the
greek
menads
and
bacchantes
of
the
dionysiac
chorus
in
the
theatre
of
our
old
english
peasants
treading
the
mazes
and
dancing
round
the
maypole
of
dances
at
breton
of
the
fairies
supposed
to
dance
in
the
forest
glade
beneath
the
moon
why
dancing
is
as
much
an
expression
of
the
human
secret
as
literature
itself
and
i
expect
it
is
even
more
ancient
and
harriet
and
emily
leaping
on
the
pavement
to
that
jingling
clattering
tune
were
merely
showing
that
though
they
were
the
children
of
the
slum
and
the
of
the
school
board
they
were
yet
human
and
partakers
of
the
universal
sacrament
but
if
you
ask
were
they
conscious
of
all
this
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
give
a
direct
answer
i
need
hardly
say
that
they
could
not
have
put
their
very
real
emotion
into
the
terms
i
have
used
nor
perhaps
into
any
terms
at
all
and
yet
they
know
the
delight
of
what
they
do
as
much
as
if
they
had
been
initiated
in
all
the
mysteries
if
someone
with
the
genius
of
socrates
for
propounding
searching
questions
could
corner
harriet
and
emily
and
face
and
overcome
that
preliminary
inevitable
garn
it
is
possible
that
he
might
find
that
they
were
fully
conscious
of
the
reasons
why
they
danced
and
delighted
in
dancing
just
as
socrates
demonstrated
to
the
slave
that
he
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
geometry
but
failing
a
socrates
and
using
words
in
their
usual
senses
i
suppose
we
must
say
that
they
are
not
conscious
they
dance
and
leap
without
calculation
as
they
eat
and
drink
and
as
birds
sing
in
springtime
and
very
much
the
same
answer
must
be
given
to
the
similar
question
as
to
literature
i
said
that
to
answer
the
riddle
fully
and
completely
one
would
have
to
make
an
analysis
of
human
nature
and
in
truth
the
problem
is
simply
a
problem
of
the
consciousness
and
subconsciousness
and
of
the
action
and
interaction
between
the
two
i
will
not
be
too
dogmatic
we
are
in
misty
uncertain
and
unexplored
regions
and
it
is
impossible
to
chart
all
the
cities
and
mountains
and
streams
and
fix
with
the
nicety
of
the
ordnance
survey
their
several
places
on
the
map
but
i
am
strangely
inclined
to
think
that
all
the
quintessence
of
art
is
distilled
from
the
subconscious
and
not
from
the
conscious
self
or
in
other
words
that
the
artificer
seldom
or
never
understands
the
ends
and
designs
and
spirit
of
the
artist
our
literary
architects
have
all
i
think
builded
better
than
they
knew
and
very
often
i
expect
the
draughtsman
who
sees
the
triumph
and
enjoys
it
in
his
manner
takes
all
the
credit
to
himself
and
ludicrously
imagines
that
it
is
his
careful
drawing
and
amplification
of
the
sketch
and
following
the
scale
that
have
created
the
high
and
holy
house
of
god
there
is
a
queer
instance
of
what
i
mean
in
dickens
preface
to
the
later
editions
of
pickwick
i
put
the
book
up
on
a
high
shelf
the
other
day
and
i
ca
be
bothered
getting
it
down
and
verifying
the
quotation
but
i
believe
the
author
after
telling
us
that
the
original
design
was
to
give
opportunities
to
the
etcher
seymour
goes
on
to
recapitulate
as
it
were
the
achievements
of
the
book
and
his
list
of
triumphs
is
much
more
amusing
than
any
list
in
rabelais
the
law
of
imprisonment
for
debt
has
been
altered
fleet
prison
has
been
pulled
down
the
is
coming
clerks
have
nicer
manners
parliamentary
elections
are
a
little
better
but
they
might
be
better
still
and
one
wonders
that
he
does
not
announce
that
in
consequence
of
the
publication
of
pickwick
medical
students
have
given
up
brandy
for
it
is
evident
you
see
that
dickens
thought
or
thought
that
he
thought
for
it
is
very
difficult
to
be
exact
that
his
masterpiece
of
the
his
epitome
of
pantagruelism
was
written
to
correct
abuses
and
looking
back
many
years
after
its
publication
he
congratulates
himself
that
most
of
these
abuses
have
been
corrected
and
one
can
almost
hear
him
say
it
is
a
very
fine
book
he
was
impelled
to
write
this
nonsense
of
the
preface
because
he
was
by
comparison
educated
harriet
the
dancer
would
probably
tell
you
if
you
succeeded
in
penetrating
beyond
garn
that
she
danced
because
she
liked
it
but
granting
that
the
poisoning
process
had
been
carried
out
more
successfully
in
the
case
of
emily
she
might
conceivably
reply
that
she
danced
becos
it
and
teacher
says
as
it
cirkilates
the
blood
emily
you
see
obtained
the
prize
for
physiology
as
well
as
for
french
and
the
she
is
thus
enabled
to
give
reasons
and
they
are
quite
as
valuable
as
the
reasons
of
dickens
explaining
the
merits
of
pickwick
you
know
that
pompous
old
fool
forster
who
took
in
dickens
at
times
sniffed
a
little
at
pickwick
and
thought
the
later
books
with
their
ingenious
plots
and
floods
of
maudlin
tears
and
portentous
immense
advances
and
i
suppose
the
master
felt
obliged
to
justify
himself
for
that
first
enterprise
to
show
that
he
had
not
really
been
inspired
but
had
written
a
useful
tract
you
remember
he
explains
stiggins
he
warns
you
not
to
be
under
any
misconceptions
not
to
suppose
that
stiggins
satirises
a
b
or
c
since
he
is
only
aimed
at
x
y
and
z
can
you
conceive
that
a
mediæval
artist
in
gurgoyles
having
perfected
for
our
eternal
joy
a
splendid
grinning
creature
lurking
on
the
parapet
and
having
endowed
him
greatly
to
our
oblectation
with
the
tail
of
a
dragon
the
body
of
a
dog
the
feet
of
an
eagle
the
head
of
a
bull
in
hysterics
with
a
franciscan
cowl
by
way
of
finish
should
afterwards
explain
that
no
offence
was
intended
to
father
ambrose
the
prior
over
the
way
so
it
seems
fairly
plain
does
it
that
in
the
case
of
dickens
at
all
events
there
was
no
very
clear
consciousness
of
what
had
been
achieved
and
i
believe
that
you
would
find
the
rule
hold
good
with
other
artists
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
with
dickens
it
holds
in
a
very
high
degree
just
because
there
was
that
tremendous
gulf
i
have
so
often
spoken
about
between
his
inward
and
his
outward
self
because
with
the
soul
of
rare
genius
his
intelligence
lived
in
those
dreary
dusty
london
streets
because
the
artificer
even
while
he
carried
out
the
artist
commands
understood
very
little
what
he
was
doing
but
one
can
trace
the
same
working
in
other
cases
take
the
case
of
mr
hardy
for
instance
you
remember
what
i
said
about
his
two
on
a
tower
i
praised
it
for
its
ecstatic
passion
for
that
revelation
of
a
great
rapture
for
its
symbolism
showing
how
one
must
withdraw
from
the
common
ways
from
the
dusty
highroad
and
the
swarming
street
and
go
apart
into
high
lonely
places
if
one
would
perceive
the
high
eternal
mysteries
i
did
not
say
so
in
so
many
words
but
you
no
doubt
saw
that
i
was
indicating
that
which
is
in
my
opinion
valuable
in
mr
work
that
which
makes
his
books
literature
and
i
am
sure
he
would
most
decidedly
and
entirely
disagree
with
me
and
if
you
want
to
know
why
i
am
sure
i
refer
you
to
his
later
books
to
his
tess
and
jude
you
know
how
the
tess
was
talked
about
how
it
remade
the
author
from
the
commercial
standpoint
simply
because
it
contained
with
many
beautiful
things
many
absurd
preachments
much
of
a
kind
suited
to
the
intelligence
of
persons
who
think
that
robert
elsmere
is
literature
if
mr
hardy
had
been
a
conscious
artist
if
he
had
understood
i
mean
what
makes
the
charm
and
the
wonder
of
two
on
a
tower
he
could
never
have
adulterated
the
tale
of
tess
with
a
tract
he
would
never
have
turned
jude
into
a
long
pamphlet
on
secondary
education
for
farm
labourers
with
agnostic
notes
it
is
pathetic
in
the
latter
book
amidst
much
weary
and
futile
writing
to
come
across
a
passage
here
and
there
that
shows
the
artist
striving
for
utterance
longing
to
sing
us
his
incantations
in
spite
of
the
preacher
who
howls
him
down
think
of
that
distant
vision
of
oxford
from
the
lonely
field
of
all
those
clustering
roofs
and
spires
wet
with
rain
suddenly
kindling
into
glancing
and
scintillant
fire
at
the
sunset
and
then
remember
with
what
sorrow
that
this
is
but
an
oasis
in
a
barren
land
of
blundering
argument
it
is
almost
as
if
literature
had
become
literature
the
literature
of
the
subject
and
one
must
only
rejoice
that
the
artist
still
lives
even
if
the
enemy
has
shut
him
up
in
prison
you
can
trace
the
struggle
all
through
the
book
sue
was
an
artistic
conception
a
very
curious
but
a
very
beautiful
revelation
of
some
strange
elements
in
the
nature
and
in
the
love
of
women
but
how
difficult
it
is
to
detect
this
the
real
sue
underneath
the
surface
which
makes
sue
seem
the
prophetess
of
the
woman
question
or
whatever
the
contemporary
twaddle
on
the
subject
was
called
conceive
the
odyssey
so
handled
that
it
seems
like
a
volume
in
a
technical
series
dealing
with
seamanship
and
navigation
think
what
might
have
happened
if
the
rabelais
who
had
been
put
in
the
dark
cell
of
had
completely
gained
the
upper
hand
and
had
silenced
that
other
rabelais
that
solitary
and
rapturous
soul
who
had
seen
as
in
a
glass
the
marvellous
face
of
man
well
the
five
books
of
the
pantagruel
would
have
conveyed
to
us
no
doubt
with
some
eloquence
and
vigour
the
highly
unimportant
fact
that
françois
rabelais
runaway
franciscan
friar
did
not
like
franciscan
friars
and
now
that
the
centuries
have
gone
by
we
see
how
comparatively
worthless
such
a
book
as
that
would
have
been
fortunately
pantagruel
was
too
strong
for
the
forces
of
panurge
and
frère
jean
combined
and
so
they
have
been
able
to
do
little
harm
to
the
book
and
how
one
wishes
that
it
might
be
so
with
mr
hardy
it
is
not
as
if
he
had
no
body
for
his
conceptions
his
studies
of
peasant
folk
do
very
well
as
backgrounds
for
his
dramas
though
of
course
his
work
in
this
way
good
as
it
is
is
not
his
element
of
real
value
but
it
is
inoffensive
always
sometimes
amusing
and
it
might
well
suffice
him
in
his
more
material
moments
when
he
feels
the
necessity
of
descending
from
the
solitary
heights
into
the
pleasant
populous
valleys
and
villages
of
common
life
but
his
true
work
is
as
it
is
the
work
of
all
artists
the
shaping
for
us
of
ecstasy
by
means
of
symbols
and
for
him
the
symbol
which
he
understands
is
no
doubt
the
passion
of
love
and
with
it
the
symbol
of
red
lonely
ploughlands
of
deep
overshadowed
lanes
that
climb
the
hills
and
wander
into
lands
that
we
know
not
of
dark
woods
that
hide
a
secret
of
strange
immemorial
barrows
where
one
may
have
communion
with
the
souls
of
the
dead
the
passion
of
love
the
passion
of
the
hills
no
artist
could
desire
more
exquisite
or
significant
symbols
than
these
nor
need
he
seek
for
more
beautiful
forms
for
the
expression
of
the
perfect
beauty
and
mr
hardy
has
chosen
to
be
a
pamphleteer
to
voice
for
us
our
poor
ignorant
contemporary
chatter
it
is
as
if
an
angel
pen
were
to
be
occupied
in
inditing
society
small
talk
but
it
proves
the
unconsciousness
of
mr
hardy
art
and
here
by
the
way
i
am
moved
to
revert
to
the
case
of
rabelais
how
far
you
may
ask
was
he
conscious
of
what
he
was
saying
and
i
see
you
remember
that
passage
i
quoted
from
the
last
book
the
splendid
declaration
of
the
priestess
bacbuc
that
by
wine
is
man
made
divine
that
passage
and
indeed
many
other
passages
in
the
final
chapters
would
seem
to
show
that
the
author
had
worked
consciously
and
i
certainly
think
the
point
worth
our
consideration
you
will
remember
that
i
stated
my
rule
without
bigotry
i
rather
proposed
it
as
a
pious
opinion
to
the
effect
that
in
literature
the
finest
things
are
not
designed
and
i
confess
that
at
first
sight
this
matter
of
bacbuc
and
her
allocution
looks
rather
like
an
exception
to
the
rule
a
proof
that
rabelais
at
all
events
understood
clearly
what
he
was
doing
well
it
may
have
been
so
for
rabelais
was
as
i
think
i
have
shown
a
very
exceptional
man
whom
it
would
be
difficult
to
place
in
any
class
but
i
hardly
think
this
an
instance
of
the
proverbial
and
fallacious
exception
that
proves
the
rule
in
the
first
place
i
believe
that
some
french
editors
have
grave
doubts
whether
rabelais
wrote
the
fifth
book
at
all
but
i
am
not
inclined
to
press
this
point
point
is
that
the
allocution
of
bacbuc
and
all
those
chapters
which
describe
the
oracle
of
the
holy
bottle
are
the
last
in
the
book
the
last
words
of
the
author
and
i
am
in
no
way
concerned
to
defend
the
position
that
an
author
must
always
remain
unconscious
of
the
work
that
he
has
done
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
that
always
or
almost
always
he
is
unconscious
while
he
is
writing
but
i
see
no
reason
why
the
revelation
may
not
come
to
him
afterwards
especially
in
such
a
case
as
the
pantagruel
which
was
the
affair
of
many
years
of
a
lifetime
indeed
in
the
beginning
of
production
in
the
youth
the
springtime
of
artistic
work
the
creative
influence
prevails
and
this
it
seems
to
me
always
or
almost
always
operates
secretly
but
in
later
years
the
critical
spirit
is
apt
to
assert
itself
and
this
will
lead
very
naturally
to
the
artist
understanding
more
plainly
the
nature
of
his
accomplishment
rabelais
had
a
long
wonderful
career
his
life
was
full
of
incident
of
violent
breaks
and
his
books
were
produced
at
intervals
and
it
seems
to
me
very
possible
that
towards
the
end
he
may
have
reflected
on
what
he
had
done
and
have
understood
in
part
at
all
events
the
sense
of
the
amazing
message
that
he
had
delivered
this
i
think
is
the
explanation
of
the
holy
bottle
chapters
and
you
will
note
that
admirable
as
criticism
they
are
inferior
as
art
to
those
astounding
early
pages
where
there
is
no
hint
of
conscious
workmanship
but
rather
evidence
of
a
man
for
whom
the
world
has
been
transformed
who
has
been
visited
by
an
astounding
vision
he
takes
an
old
popular
story
about
a
giant
he
takes
the
vine
that
flourishes
in
his
native
chinonnais
he
takes
the
new
learning
that
seems
to
him
like
the
new
wine
he
takes
the
gross
tale
of
the
farmhouse
and
the
tavern
the
rank
speech
of
the
people
and
with
these
elements
with
these
facts
he
symbolises
the
revelation
that
he
has
received
he
writes
he
writes
on
he
writes
madly
and
every
line
is
written
in
a
fury
of
delight
but
i
think
i
may
say
there
is
at
the
moment
of
writing
no
conscious
apperception
of
all
that
that
torrent
of
words
conveys
and
implies
may
well
come
later
one
may
well
begin
with
legend
grandgousier
was
a
good
drinker
and
end
with
the
interpretation
all
truth
and
every
philosophy
is
contained
in
wine
but
i
believe
that
if
rabelais
had
perceived
this
at
the
beginning
he
would
have
been
not
an
artist
but
a
philosopher
well
if
you
are
content
with
this
comment
on
bacbuc
i
should
like
to
give
you
a
very
curious
instance
of
our
own
day
in
which
the
unconscious
artist
has
been
subdued
by
the
conscious
preacher
you
remember
those
very
notable
books
keynotes
and
discords
i
have
not
seen
them
for
some
time
so
i
am
afraid
my
criticism
will
be
very
loose
and
general
but
i
think
that
the
two
volumes
mark
very
well
the
fatal
descent
from
the
higher
to
the
lower
ground
in
the
first
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
somewhat
slight
but
very
genuine
note
of
ecstasy
i
mean
that
you
can
collect
a
certain
distinct
image
of
real
womanhood
not
the
laboured
foolish
inane
psychology
of
mr
meredith
and
those
who
work
with
him
not
the
analysis
of
the
surface
of
the
society
woman
belonging
to
a
particular
grade
and
a
particular
period
but
of
the
very
woman
who
remains
really
the
same
in
all
social
grades
and
in
all
ages
i
remember
thinking
when
i
read
keynotes
that
it
was
a
lonely
book
it
hinted
i
think
a
soul
apart
and
afar
from
the
secondary
tertiary
problems
of
an
organised
civilisation
and
though
there
was
an
undertone
of
preaching
and
arguing
the
total
impression
was
curiously
and
beautifully
artistic
i
found
if
i
remember
rightly
that
subordination
of
the
accidental
to
the
essential
that
i
praised
in
two
in
a
tower
and
i
am
the
more
convinced
that
this
is
so
by
my
own
recollections
i
have
forgotten
all
about
social
conditions
if
any
such
things
are
indicated
i
only
think
of
women
and
of
men
of
the
true
inalterable
human
nature
and
here
it
seems
to
me
you
have
a
very
high
achievement
but
the
next
volume
discords
took
distinctly
lower
ground
the
artifice
was
better
the
stories
as
stories
were
told
with
more
skill
and
more
deftness
than
anything
in
keynotes
but
there
was
no
more
literature
there
was
only
the
literature
of
the
subject
the
incidents
were
no
longer
symbols
of
an
emotion
they
had
become
the
basis
of
an
agitation
concerning
which
my
curiosity
never
led
me
to
inquire
further
and
there
you
see
another
proof
of
the
unconsciousness
of
art
if
the
author
of
keynotes
had
understood
her
achievement
discords
would
never
have
been
written
one
might
continue
the
almost
would
not
wordsworth
supposing
him
to
have
been
a
conscious
artist
have
rather
cut
off
his
right
hand
than
have
suffered
such
a
as
the
ode
on
intimations
of
immortality
to
have
the
companionship
of
the
enormous
mass
of
futility
and
stupidity
which
constitutes
the
greater
part
of
the
complete
works
well
there
is
the
evidence
that
must
guide
us
in
answering
the
question
you
propounded
and
it
shows
conclusively
enough
i
think
that
art
is
not
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
term
a
conscious
product
perhaps
it
would
be
a
perilous
dogmatism
on
the
other
hand
to
definitely
pronounce
it
to
be
unconscious
and
i
expect
we
had
better
take
refuge
in
the
subconscious
that
convenient
name
for
the
transcendental
element
in
human
nature
for
myself
i
like
best
my
old
figure
of
the
shadowy
companion
the
invisible
attendant
who
walks
all
the
way
beside
us
though
his
feet
are
in
the
other
world
and
i
think
that
it
is
he
who
whispers
to
us
his
ineffable
secrets
which
we
clumsily
endeavour
to
set
down
in
mortal
language
i
think
that
while
the
artist
works
he
is
conscious
of
joy
and
of
nothing
more
he
works
beautifully
but
he
could
give
no
of
the
process
and
when
he
endeavours
to
explain
himself
we
are
often
perplexed
by
this
strange
spectacle
of
a
man
wholly
ignorant
of
his
own
creation
consider
again
the
grotesqueness
of
that
preface
to
pickwick
it
is
really
as
if
a
great
sculptor
congratulated
on
his
achievement
should
answer
that
his
venus
was
indeed
beautiful
because
it
tended
to
improve
the
marble
industry
and
the
general
knowledge
of
anatomy
and
after
all
the
conclusion
does
return
to
us
from
other
than
literary
sources
you
can
not
conceive
a
builder
of
the
fourteenth
century
hesitating
as
to
the
respective
merits
of
romanesque
norman
first
and
second
pointed
to
him
there
was
only
one
possible
method
and
he
built
as
he
spoke
without
calculation
and
without
conscious
effort
only
knowing
the
joy
of
his
work
so
indeed
we
all
speak
and
live
when
we
are
not
bound
by
convention
and
acquired
usages
and
manners
and
you
see
that
art
properly
so
called
takes
its
place
in
the
great
scheme
of
things
it
is
no
studied
contortion
no
strange
trick
acquired
by
the
late
ingenuity
of
man
but
as
natural
and
as
supernatural
as
the
blossoming
of
a
flower
and
the
singing
of
the
nightingale
art
indeed
is
wholly
natural
artifice
is
more
or
less
acquired
the
creature
of
reason
of
experiment
of
systematised
intelligence
it
is
doubtful
i
suppose
whether
the
natural
untaught
man
has
of
himself
by
endowment
any
artifice
at
all
doubtful
perhaps
whether
in
the
beginning
his
artifice
was
not
the
product
of
his
art
whether
he
did
not
learn
to
speak
with
artifice
because
he
had
received
from
nature
the
art
of
singing
certainly
the
child
entering
the
world
has
not
the
inborn
artifice
of
the
swallow
and
the
bee
this
artifice
it
seems
man
has
been
forced
to
acquire
by
slow
and
painful
degrees
and
perhaps
it
only
differs
from
the
artifice
of
animals
in
that
it
has
been
aided
and
reinforced
by
imagination
that
is
by
art
that
is
by
the
power
the
human
soul
possesses
of
projecting
itself
into
the
unknown
and
adventuring
in
the
realm
of
nothingness
man
i
mean
could
never
have
invented
the
telephone
had
he
not
first
created
it
had
he
not
conceived
the
possibility
of
its
existence
when
as
yet
it
was
and
so
his
artifice
will
always
be
progressive
and
distinguished
from
the
artifice
of
animals
but
art
is
born
with
man
and
is
of
the
essence
the
very
differentia
of
man
it
is
of
his
very
inmost
being
and
therefore
i
suppose
is
removed
from
his
consciousness
simply
because
it
is
within
and
not
from
without
you
may
say
that
i
have
been
vague
that
i
have
not
solved
the
problem
i
propounded
that
i
have
not
clearly
explained
whether
the
greeks
knew
what
they
did
when
they
worshipped
dionysus
whether
rabelais
was
conscious
of
an
inner
meaning
in
his
praise
of
wine
whether
dickens
understood
the
value
of
his
punch
and
brandy
but
if
i
have
been
vague
it
is
because
man
in
the
last
analysis
is
a
tremendous
mystery
because
he
is
a
complex
being
because
he
is
at
once
pantagruel
and
panurge
and
frère
jean
because
he
is
both
don
quixote
and
sancho
panza
in
some
cases
pantagruel
and
panurge
seem
to
speak
a
common
language
to
be
able
to
communicate
the
one
with
the
other
if
rabelais
wrote
the
dive
bouteille
chapters
he
certainly
understood
much
of
that
which
he
had
expressed
in
symbols
sometimes
the
two
seem
like
foreigners
in
one
home
pantagruel
dictates
and
panurge
the
scribe
writes
down
his
words
hardly
or
not
at
all
comprehending
the
magic
symbols
that
he
expresses
so
dickens
ludicrously
misinterprets
his
own
pickwick
and
doubtless
this
understanding
of
the
artificer
of
the
artist
varies
in
an
almost
infinite
chain
of
there
have
been
artists
perhaps
who
have
worked
like
men
under
the
influence
of
haschish
who
have
opened
their
mouths
and
prophesied
and
then
recovering
from
the
possession
have
sat
up
and
stared
and
asked
where
they
were
and
what
they
had
been
doing
indeed
it
may
be
that
this
was
the
condition
of
the
working
of
art
in
the
very
dawn
of
human
life
for
this
no
doubt
is
the
explanation
of
that
old
equation
in
which
bards
magicians
seers
prophets
and
madmen
ranked
all
together
as
men
who
spoke
and
worked
miracles
things
unintelligible
to
the
common
sense
to
the
understanding
which
regulates
and
arranges
the
affairs
of
the
common
life
all
these
were
alike
men
of
the
mountains
men
who
withdrew
from
the
camp
and
went
apart
into
high
solitary
places
into
the
lonely
wilderness
into
the
forest
and
in
such
retirements
and
cells
they
uttered
the
voices
that
came
to
them
speaking
words
that
were
unintelligible
to
themselves
on
the
other
hand
there
may
have
been
artists
in
whom
the
two
persons
have
been
happily
reconciled
who
have
not
only
the
gift
of
tongues
but
also
the
gift
of
the
interpretation
of
tongues
even
these
i
think
are
always
possessed
ecstatic
rapt
from
their
common
nature
at
the
moment
of
inspiration
but
afterwards
when
the
magic
song
is
done
they
awake
and
return
and
remember
and
understand
in
a
measure
at
least
the
meaning
of
their
prophecies
they
never
wholly
understand
they
are
never
able
to
express
in
rational
terms
the
force
of
the
message
for
the
good
reason
that
the
language
of
the
soul
infinitely
transcends
the
language
of
the
understanding
because
art
is
indeed
the
sole
channel
by
which
the
highest
and
purest
truth
can
reach
us
you
may
perhaps
succeed
in
giving
a
boer
some
notion
of
a
greek
chorus
through
the
medium
of
the
taal
but
it
would
be
vain
to
dream
of
translating
almost
perfect
beauty
into
that
poor
medium
framed
for
the
temporary
and
corporal
necessities
of
rough
and
illiterate
farmers
and
so
however
well
an
artist
or
those
who
appreciate
his
work
may
understand
his
meaning
they
do
but
understand
a
little
since
the
tongue
of
art
has
many
words
which
have
no
rendering
in
the
speech
of
the
understanding
here
then
is
another
form
of
our
text
which
enables
us
to
separate
art
from
artifice
literature
from
reading
matter
artifice
is
explicable
you
remember
that
someone
has
said
thackeray
was
simply
the
ordinary
clubman
genius
and
a
style
we
must
correct
his
phrases
but
if
you
substitute
an
immense
talent
of
observation
for
genius
and
a
great
gift
of
expression
for
style
i
think
the
definition
admirable
thackeray
in
short
is
the
clubman
of
heightened
faculties
he
differs
not
in
quiddity
but
in
quality
and
quantity
from
his
neighbour
at
the
window
he
looks
more
closely
than
tom
eaves
and
he
can
give
you
the
result
of
his
inspection
in
better
phrases
and
with
a
better
system
but
he
looks
at
the
same
things
from
the
same
standpoint
and
you
and
i
can
admire
his
work
and
be
amused
and
delighted
by
it
but
we
have
no
sense
of
miracle
of
transcendent
vision
and
achievement
we
simply
see
a
man
who
does
the
things
that
we
do
but
does
them
with
a
far
greater
dexterity
you
may
watch
an
acrobat
with
an
immense
admiration
but
you
recognise
that
you
too
are
potentially
an
acrobat
that
with
a
little
training
you
too
could
hang
by
the
heels
though
not
with
such
grace
nor
for
so
long
a
time
but
art
is
always
miraculous
in
its
origin
in
its
working
in
its
results
it
is
beyond
and
above
explanation
and
the
unconsciousness
is
only
one
phase
of
its
infinite
mysteries
vi
i
am
afraid
that
at
our
last
conversation
i
rather
spoke
to
you
as
if
you
were
a
public
meeting
not
precisely
in
that
manner
perhaps
since
no
public
meeting
that
i
can
imagine
would
have
stood
me
for
a
moment
but
i
fear
that
i
was
what
is
called
and
yet
how
can
one
avoid
that
reproach
look
here
let
us
suppose
an
examination
paper
and
the
following
questions
set
explain
in
rational
terms
the
quest
of
the
holy
graal
state
whether
in
your
opinion
such
a
vessel
ever
existed
and
if
you
think
it
did
not
justify
your
pleasure
in
reading
the
account
of
the
search
for
it
explain
logically
your
delight
in
colour
state
in
terms
that
voltaire
would
have
understood
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
the
beauty
of
line
what
do
you
mean
by
the
word
music
give
the
rational
explanation
of
bach
fugues
showing
them
to
be
as
true
as
biology
and
useful
as
applied
mechanics
estimate
the
value
of
westminster
abbey
in
the
avoirdupois
measure
the
light
that
never
was
on
land
or
sea
what
light
faery
lands
forlorn
draw
a
map
of
the
district
in
question
putting
in
principal
towns
and
naming
exports
show
that
heaven
lies
about
us
in
our
infancy
must
mean
wholesome
maternal
influences
surround
us
in
our
childhood
you
say
that
is
all
nonsense
that
one
can
not
express
art
of
any
kind
in
the
terms
of
rationalism
well
i
agree
with
you
that
it
nonsense
that
the
tables
of
weights
and
measures
give
no
æsthetic
guide
to
the
value
of
westminster
abbey
but
if
we
agree
on
this
i
am
afraid
that
we
must
be
content
to
be
called
having
once
for
all
settled
that
common
sense
has
nothing
to
do
with
literary
art
we
must
be
i
suppose
uncommon
and
apparently
nonsensical
if
we
want
to
talk
about
it
to
any
profit
that
is
what
it
comes
to
after
all
if
literature
be
a
kind
of
dignified
reporting
in
which
the
reporter
is
at
liberty
to
invent
some
incidents
and
leave
out
others
and
to
arrange
all
in
the
order
that
pleases
him
best
then
let
us
have
as
much
common
sense
and
rationalism
as
you
please
and
the
more
the
better
but
if
literature
is
a
mysterious
ecstasy
the
withdrawal
from
all
common
and
ordinary
conditions
well
i
suppose
we
had
better
be
mystics
when
we
discuss
the
subject
and
frankly
confess
that
with
its
first
principles
logic
has
nothing
to
do
i
suppose
that
there
are
only
two
parties
in
the
world
the
rationalists
and
the
mystics
and
one
vote
on
literature
goes
with
one
party
one
might
leave
the
matter
there
and
amiably
agree
to
differ
with
the
other
side
but
i
personally
have
the
ferocity
to
insist
that
my
side
the
mystical
is
wholly
right
and
the
other
the
rationalist
wholly
wrong
and
moreover
i
shall
be
so
indecent
as
to
prove
the
truth
of
my
position
but
i
have
done
so
and
with
that
examination
paper
i
just
read
out
to
you
for
if
rationalism
be
the
truth
then
all
literature
all
that
both
sides
agree
in
thinking
the
finest
literature
is
simple
lunacy
and
all
the
world
of
the
arts
must
go
into
the
region
of
mania
take
the
lowest
the
simplest
instance
here
is
a
knife
with
a
wooden
handle
and
the
handle
has
certain
curious
carved
designs
on
it
which
do
enable
it
to
be
held
better
why
is
this
knife
better
more
to
be
valued
than
that
other
knife
which
is
not
decorated
at
all
it
does
not
cut
better
it
does
not
justify
its
existence
and
purpose
as
a
knife
more
than
the
other
where
is
its
superiority
because
i
find
pleasure
in
seeing
those
designs
but
do
i
find
any
pleasure
in
ornament
what
is
the
rationalistic
justification
for
that
pleasure
by
logical
definition
a
knife
is
an
instrument
for
cutting
and
nothing
else
the
plain
cuts
as
well
as
the
ornate
then
are
you
sorry
if
you
lose
the
one
while
you
do
care
twopence
for
the
loss
of
the
other
you
have
at
last
to
answer
that
you
have
a
joy
which
you
can
not
in
any
way
define
in
the
purely
decorative
pattern
and
with
that
answer
the
whole
system
of
rationalism
topples
over
rationalism
may
say
to
you
either
give
a
definite
reason
for
going
to
mass
or
leave
off
going
you
have
only
to
answer
your
command
is
based
on
the
premiss
that
one
should
do
nothing
without
being
able
to
give
a
definite
reason
for
it
but
i
can
give
no
definite
reason
for
liking
the
odyssey
or
a
curiously
carved
knife
and
yet
you
confess
that
i
am
right
in
liking
these
things
then
i
have
proved
the
contradictory
of
your
premiss
as
you
have
admitted
that
there
are
things
that
one
may
do
without
being
able
to
give
a
definite
reason
for
doing
them
i
shall
not
neglect
the
parson
bell
of
course
all
this
is
altogether
outside
of
my
business
but
i
confess
i
am
fond
of
carrying
things
to
their
limits
you
remember
how
poor
used
to
talk
humbly
and
yet
proudly
of
my
system
though
i
am
afraid
my
system
never
emerged
from
the
state
of
fragments
and
and
i
too
though
i
have
only
broken
morsels
and
ruinous
stones
to
show
for
the
splendid
outlines
and
indicated
arches
of
coleridge
still
like
to
follow
up
an
argument
whithersoever
it
will
lead
me
regardless
of
consequences
and
this
i
am
sure
should
count
for
righteousness
with
our
friends
the
rationalists
i
love
to
start
a
something
as
follows
i
admire
that
odd
but
beautiful
little
decorative
scheme
on
the
seventeenth
century
chest
and
therefore
i
think
poetry
as
poetry
finer
than
prose
as
prose
hence
i
approve
of
ritualism
in
the
service
of
the
church
and
from
the
same
premiss
i
draw
the
conclusion
that
keats
was
a
poet
and
that
pope
was
not
pope
not
being
a
poet
it
follows
that
to
intone
is
in
every
way
better
than
to
read
the
liturgy
and
the
offices
and
reading
the
service
being
wrong
you
will
easily
infer
that
i
dislike
mr
frith
pictures
and
after
learning
that
i
do
not
care
for
the
derby
day
you
will
scarcely
require
my
opinion
as
to
the
theoretical
righteousness
of
the
first
reform
bill
and
from
my
attitude
towards
lord
john
measure
you
can
of
course
guess
my
opinion
on
the
respective
merits
of
the
french
and
english
languages
as
literary
instruments
and
french
being
vastly
inferior
to
english
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
english
reformation
was
a
great
though
perhaps
unavoidable
misfortune
hence
you
see
admiring
certain
lines
cut
in
an
old
oaken
box
i
am
led
by
the
strictest
logic
to
dislike
the
religious
policy
of
edward
with
all
the
other
consequences
in
order
and
on
the
other
hand
if
i
saw
no
sense
in
that
rude
ornament
i
should
be
an
atheist
or
at
the
mildest
an
attendant
at
pleasant
sunday
afternoons
with
george
eliot
for
my
favourite
reading
yes
i
like
my
theories
to
work
through
and
i
confess
that
my
belief
in
the
truth
of
my
system
is
very
much
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
it
does
work
through
that
it
seems
to
me
justified
by
the
facts
of
life
i
mean
that
the
premiss
which
enables
me
to
declare
keats
to
be
a
poet
and
pope
not
to
be
a
poet
does
really
enable
me
to
pronounce
democracy
to
be
a
bad
system
in
theory
and
the
premiss
baldly
stated
is
simply
this
that
logic
does
not
cover
life
or
in
other
words
that
life
can
not
be
judged
by
the
rules
of
logic
of
common
sense
but
yet
i
am
using
logic
all
the
time
you
say
certainly
but
i
am
using
it
in
its
right
place
to
do
the
work
for
which
it
is
competent
if
i
say
that
a
scythe
is
not
exactly
the
instrument
for
performing
a
surgical
operation
i
am
not
therefore
bound
to
have
my
meadow
mown
with
a
bistoury
a
microscope
is
good
and
a
telescope
is
good
but
it
is
the
microscope
that
one
uses
in
bacteriology
you
know
do
you
that
ever
since
that
unhappy
reformation
of
ours
people
have
been
talking
nonsense
about
the
aristotelian
logic
and
fumbling
in
the
most
grotesque
manner
for
some
new
logic
our
great
false
prophet
bacon
a
wretch
infinitely
more
guilty
than
hobbes
began
it
in
england
with
his
novum
organum
and
if
you
wish
to
really
estimate
educated
folly
to
touch
the
bottom
of
the
incredible
depths
to
which
a
man
of
information
may
sink
read
macaulay
comparison
of
the
old
philosophy
and
the
new
philosophy
the
essayist
says
that
the
old
philosophy
was
no
good
because
it
never
led
up
to
the
and
the
telegraph
post
is
it
almost
humiliating
to
think
that
we
have
to
acknowledge
ourselves
of
the
same
genus
as
that
brilliant
macaulay
but
if
i
told
you
that
the
greek
alphabet
was
no
good
because
it
has
never
grilled
a
single
steak
you
would
probably
get
uneasy
and
make
for
the
door
and
if
you
were
charitable
you
would
tell
the
landlady
that
i
ought
to
be
taken
care
of
but
such
a
remark
as
that
is
no
whit
more
lunatic
than
macaulay
comparison
between
philosophy
properly
so
called
and
physical
science
applied
to
utilitarian
purposes
well
all
the
portentous
stuff
that
has
been
written
about
logic
is
nonsense
of
exactly
the
same
kind
the
scholastic
logic
people
said
wo
discover
the
truth
that
is
perfectly
true
but
then
the
scholastic
logic
was
not
intended
to
discover
truth
it
will
draw
conclusions
from
truths
already
discovered
from
premisses
granted
but
it
wont
make
premisses
any
more
than
a
scythe
will
make
grass
and
it
is
curiously
enough
the
very
class
of
people
who
despise
the
formal
logic
who
insist
on
your
giving
logical
reasons
for
actions
and
emotions
which
are
altogether
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
logic
with
one
breath
they
say
aristotle
is
useless
because
the
organon
could
never
have
led
men
to
discover
the
and
with
the
next
breath
they
ask
you
what
you
mean
by
admiring
the
ode
on
a
grecian
urn
if
you
ca
give
any
logical
reason
for
your
admiration
your
religion
does
rest
on
a
logical
foundation
they
say
but
does
anything
of
any
consequence
rest
on
a
logical
foundation
can
you
reduce
the
morte
into
valid
syllogisms
in
can
you
disprove
salisbury
cathedral
by
the
aid
of
what
is
the
rational
explanation
of
our
wonder
and
joy
at
the
vision
of
the
hills
are
a
great
symphony
the
swell
and
triumph
of
the
organ
the
voices
of
the
choristers
to
be
tested
by
the
process
of
the
understanding
but
perhaps
i
am
misjudging
the
people
who
ask
these
questions
when
they
say
that
logic
does
not
discover
truth
they
doubtless
mean
by
logic
that
formal
analysis
of
the
ratiocinative
process
that
is
rightly
so
called
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
when
they
condemn
religious
or
artistic
emotions
because
they
are
illogical
they
mean
by
illogical
that
which
does
not
conduce
to
the
ease
and
comfort
of
the
digestive
apparatus
or
the
faculty
they
are
terrible
fellows
you
know
some
of
these
persons
for
example
i
asked
with
a
tone
of
undue
triumph
i
am
afraid
for
the
reason
why
we
experience
awe
and
delight
in
the
presence
of
the
hills
but
in
certain
quarters
my
problem
would
be
very
quickly
solved
i
should
be
told
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
that
my
emotion
at
the
sight
of
certain
shapes
of
earth
was
due
to
the
fact
that
hill
air
was
highly
ozonised
and
that
the
human
race
had
acquired
an
instinctive
pleasure
in
breathing
it
greatly
to
its
digestive
profit
and
if
i
tried
to
turn
the
tables
by
declaring
that
i
experienced
an
equal
though
a
different
delight
in
the
spectacle
of
a
desolate
smoking
marsh
where
a
red
sun
sinks
from
a
world
of
shivering
reeds
i
suppose
i
should
hear
that
some
remote
ancestor
of
mine
had
found
in
some
such
place
pterodactyls
plentiful
and
strong
on
the
wing
and
if
i
like
the
woods
it
was
because
a
monkey
sat
at
the
root
of
my
family
tree
and
if
i
love
an
ancient
garden
it
is
because
i
am
second
cousin
to
the
worm
there
i
confess
it
is
difficult
to
keep
one
temper
with
these
people
but
one
must
try
to
do
so
do
you
remember
how
trunnion
marriage
was
delayed
the
bridegroom
set
out
bravely
with
his
retinue
for
the
where
the
bride
waited
a
whole
half
hour
in
vain
a
messenger
was
sent
who
saw
the
whole
troop
disposed
in
a
long
field
crossing
the
road
obliquely
and
headed
by
the
bridegroom
and
his
friend
hatchway
who
finding
himself
hindered
by
a
hedge
from
proceeding
farther
in
the
same
direction
fired
a
pistol
and
stood
over
to
the
other
side
making
an
obtuse
angle
with
the
line
of
his
former
course
and
the
rest
of
the
squadron
followed
his
example
keeping
always
in
the
rear
of
each
other
like
a
flight
of
wild
geese
surprised
at
this
strange
method
of
journeying
the
messenger
came
up
and
desired
he
would
proceed
with
more
expedition
to
this
message
mr
trunnion
replied
ye
brother
do
you
see
we
make
all
possible
speed
go
back
and
tell
those
who
sent
you
that
the
wind
has
shifted
since
we
weighed
anchor
and
that
we
are
obliged
to
make
short
trips
in
tacking
by
reason
of
the
narrowness
of
the
channel
and
that
as
we
lie
within
six
points
of
the
wind
they
must
make
some
allowance
for
variation
and
leeway
sir
said
the
valet
occasion
have
you
to
go
in
that
manner
do
but
clap
spurs
to
your
horses
and
ride
straight
forward
and
i
engage
you
shall
be
at
the
church
porch
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
right
in
the
eye
answered
the
commander
brother
where
did
you
learn
your
navigation
you
see
commodore
trunnion
logic
was
perfect
only
it
was
the
logic
of
seamanship
and
not
of
riding
to
church
on
horseback
there
are
a
good
many
people
at
the
present
day
who
are
quite
unable
to
get
to
church
in
time
for
reasons
as
valid
as
trunnion
and
when
i
hear
of
the
scientific
basis
of
literature
i
am
always
a
little
reminded
of
those
scarecrows
straggling
in
short
tacks
from
one
side
of
the
lane
to
the
other
on
their
way
to
the
wedding
the
moral
is
you
know
that
they
did
get
there
i
tackled
a
materialist
once
on
very
similar
lines
he
began
by
saying
that
time
and
thought
devoted
to
religion
they
never
see
that
art
and
religion
stand
or
fall
together
religion
being
the
foundation
of
the
fine
arts
were
an
utter
waste
of
time
as
they
only
diverted
us
from
consideration
of
the
present
world
which
we
ought
to
study
to
the
utmost
and
he
went
on
to
praise
some
saying
of
confucius
on
the
folly
of
troubling
about
the
future
things
then
i
went
for
him
he
had
to
admit
that
agriculture
is
good
and
i
pointed
out
to
him
that
england
was
changed
from
a
savage
wilderness
into
a
pleasant
garden
by
the
monastic
houses
he
agreed
that
to
found
and
endow
hospitals
and
was
not
precisely
a
waste
of
time
and
i
showed
him
that
such
institutions
were
begun
by
the
religion
of
the
past
and
carried
on
by
the
religion
of
the
present
then
he
allowed
in
response
to
my
socratic
question
that
painting
was
something
and
i
demonstrated
that
all
painting
arose
from
the
religious
impulse
that
the
greatest
paintings
in
the
world
were
meant
to
adorn
churches
then
he
admitted
the
value
of
architecture
and
he
got
the
parthenon
all
the
mediæval
cathedrals
and
the
wonderful
mound
temples
of
ceylon
right
at
his
head
he
granted
me
that
travel
civilised
and
i
rubbed
in
the
pilgrimage
he
confessed
that
he
liked
to
read
the
latin
and
greek
classics
sometimes
and
he
received
from
me
information
as
to
the
monastic
scriptorium
and
its
part
in
the
preservation
of
the
old
literature
as
for
the
blessedness
of
forming
one
character
on
the
teaching
of
confucius
there
happened
to
be
an
article
in
the
paper
on
the
mandarin
class
well
my
rationalist
had
anything
to
say
to
it
at
all
with
the
exception
of
some
vague
remark
that
the
romans
made
roads
which
considering
the
state
of
england
in
the
sixth
century
was
about
as
helpful
as
the
somewhat
similar
remark
of
mr
f
aunt
that
there
are
milestones
on
the
dover
road
i
told
him
that
the
only
roman
civilisation
which
contributed
to
the
making
of
our
country
was
that
brought
over
by
st
austin
and
he
had
to
allow
that
his
statement
that
religion
was
a
waste
of
time
an
elaborate
form
of
idleness
was
to
put
it
mildly
not
proven
then
he
said
kindly
but
firmly
that
religion
rational
and
i
used
up
most
of
the
arguments
that
i
have
used
i
mean
i
showed
him
that
it
is
good
to
paint
pictures
to
write
poems
to
devise
romances
and
to
compose
symphonies
and
that
it
is
also
good
to
meditate
and
enjoy
all
these
things
hence
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
his
suppressed
premiss
had
been
disproved
and
that
he
must
no
longer
say
that
which
is
not
rational
is
absurd
and
then
i
think
the
fun
really
began
i
carried
the
war
into
the
very
camp
of
the
enemy
that
is
into
actual
observable
life
into
the
every
day
world
of
fact
and
experience
you
talk
about
reason
i
said
and
i
presume
you
wo
mind
if
i
substitute
occasionally
common
sense
for
reason
as
i
think
that
in
your
phraseology
the
two
terms
are
very
fairly
equated
very
well
then
do
you
think
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
common
sense
in
many
of
the
actions
of
animals
take
the
case
of
the
small
birds
who
mob
an
owl
all
day
in
order
that
their
enemy
may
be
kept
awake
and
so
unable
to
hoot
at
night
take
the
case
of
the
ants
who
milk
the
aphides
and
go
take
the
bees
who
rise
to
an
emergency
and
remedy
with
singular
contrivance
the
threatened
lack
of
a
queen
take
the
dog
who
brought
a
wounded
fellow
to
the
hospital
where
he
had
been
cured
all
these
are
instances
of
common
sense
they
as
rational
as
the
telegram
sell
cobras
at
once
very
good
animals
then
have
a
plentiful
supply
of
reason
and
not
of
a
mere
mechanical
reason
but
of
reason
that
can
rise
to
the
height
of
unforeseen
cases
and
remedy
unexpected
evils
when
the
experimenter
tilted
the
bees
house
to
one
side
so
that
the
equilibrium
was
in
danger
a
sufficient
number
of
bees
climbed
up
and
placed
themselves
on
the
other
side
so
that
they
constituted
a
balance
here
there
was
no
mechanism
but
a
calculated
and
rational
contrivance
animals
then
have
reason
and
its
effect
artifice
the
adaptation
of
means
to
secure
ends
but
then
how
about
instinct
by
what
motion
does
the
swallow
make
her
nest
in
spring
can
the
bee
demonstrate
the
advantages
of
the
hexagon
cell
does
the
fly
laying
its
eggs
here
and
there
in
this
or
in
that
according
to
its
kind
in
meat
or
in
dung
or
in
the
crevices
of
a
wall
rationally
foresee
that
it
is
providing
for
the
future
grub
its
only
possible
food
no
but
then
animals
even
perform
irrational
actions
though
they
have
common
sense
they
do
things
which
must
be
troublesome
to
them
at
some
instance
which
is
not
common
sense
but
if
a
bluebottle
lays
her
eggs
in
my
beef
and
knows
not
why
perhaps
i
a
man
may
sing
the
and
pray
that
i
may
be
joined
angelis

and
consider
our
own
human
life
the
great
of
war
commerce
diplomacy
of
all
the
conduct
of
life
are
often
or
usually
the
result
of
intuitions
that
is
of
irrational
and
inexplicable
mental
processes
which
elude
all
analysis
if
the
knowledge
the
successful
and
triumphant
knowledge
of
men
and
affairs
and
strategy
were
a
rational
product
then
indeed
carlyle
dictum
were
true
and
each
one
of
us
were
at
choice
a
man
of
genius
in
diplomacy
or
business
or
battle
we
know
that
it
is
not
so
and
that
no
man
by
taking
thought
can
make
himself
say
a
stonewall
jackson
and
we
have
all
heard
of
the
woman
reason
i
do
know
why
i
am
sure
that
x
a
but
i
am
sure
and
this
extremely
irrational
process
often
corresponds
with
the
truth
so
i
finished
up
your
reason
far
from
being
the
despot
of
the
world
turns
out
to
be
a
humble
though
useful
and
is
by
no
means
a
prerogative
force
even
in
affairs
of
common
everyday
existence
why
reason
alone
and
unassisted
wo
enable
you
to
make
a
decent
living
by
selling
ribbons
and
laces
and
you
have
been
trying
to
make
me
accept
its
dictation
in
the
highest
affairs
of
the
soul
you
have
been
appealing
from
the
king
majesty
in
council
to
the
magistrates
of
little
pedlington
in
petty
sessions
assembled
then
my
rationalist
made
a
point
you
know
he
said
that
some
men
seem
to
have
an
almost
miraculous
skill
in
solving
mathematical
problems
would
you
therefore
give
up
teaching
the
ordinary
arithmetic
i
was
not
alarmed
i
pointed
out
that
the
analogy
was
not
quite
perfect
the
case
i
said
was
this
a
certain
number
of
problems
were
confessedly
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
ordinary
arithmetic
altogether
but
offered
no
difficulties
to
the
lightning
calculator
who
obtained
results
that
were
demonstratively
correct
and
i
therefore
thought
it
well
to
trust
to
him
in
all
problems
of
a
similar
character
even
though
the
ordinary
arithmetic
confessedly
incompetent
assured
me
that
his
answers
were
wholly
unreliable
a
case
of
a
schoolboy
well
on
in
colenso
scouting
the
binomial
theorem
because
one
could
prove
it
by
practice
or
the
rule
of
three
i
left
then
unanswered
and
i
suppose
my
friend
passed
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
showing
that
salisbury
cathedral
was
opposed
to
the
facts
of
biology
and
that
sisters
of
charity
are
to
be
classed
with
criminal
lunatics
but
you
know
i
was
the
real
lunatic
you
would
not
have
argued
with
me
if
i
disparaged
the
greek
alphabet
because
it
never
grilled
a
single
steak
i
hinted
the
course
you
would
probably
have
pursued
if
i
had
chanced
to
make
such
an
alarming
remark
and
why
should
i
argue
with
the
sect
of
macaulay
with
the
tribe
which
utters
such
stuff
as
this
assuredly
if
the
tree
which
socrates
planted
and
plato
watered
is
to
be
judged
of
by
its
flowers
and
leaves
it
is
the
noblest
of
trees
but
if
we
take
the
homely
test
of
bacon
if
we
judge
the
tree
by
its
our
opinion
of
it
may
be
less
favourable
when
we
sum
up
the
useful
truths
which
we
owe
to
that
philosophy
to
what
do
they
amount
but
when
we
look
for
something
more
for
something
which
adds
to
the
comfort
or
alleviates
the
calamities
of
the
human
race
we
are
forced
to
own
ourselves
disappointed
no
there
is
really
nothing
to
be
said
if
the
learned
pig
found
voice
and
articulate
speech
and
expressed
his
scorn
of
the
poet
art
since
it
added
nothing
to
the
pleasures
of
the
we
might
wonder
but
we
should
not
argue
and
it
were
idle
to
contend
with
a
laughing
jackass
contemptuously
amused
by
the
chanting
of
the
cathedral
choir
and
perhaps
you
are
wondering
what
all
this
talk
of
mine
has
to
do
with
our
main
subject
literature
but
do
you
see
that
all
the
while
i
have
merely
been
reiterating
our
old
conclusions
in
a
new
phraseology
i
may
have
appeared
to
you
to
be
the
last
of
the
cavaliers
gallantly
contending
for
the
rights
of
holy
church
but
in
reality
i
have
been
showing
at
every
step
that
jane
austen
works
are
not
literature
yes
but
it
is
so
if
the
science
of
life
if
philosophy
consisted
of
a
series
of
mathematical
propositions
capable
of
rational
demonstration
then
pride
and
prejudice
would
be
the
highest
pinnacle
of
the
literary
art
but
if
not
but
oh
if
we
being
wondrous
journey
through
a
wonderful
world
if
all
our
joys
are
from
above
from
the
other
world
where
the
shadowy
companion
walks
then
no
mere
making
of
the
likeness
of
the
external
shape
will
be
our
art
no
veracious
document
will
be
our
truth
but
to
us
initiated
the
symbol
will
be
offered
and
we
shall
take
the
sign
and
adore
beneath
the
outward
and
perhaps
unlovely
accidents
the
very
presence
and
eternal
indwelling
of
god
we
have
tracked
ecstasy
by
many
strange
paths
in
divers
strange
disguises
but
i
think
that
now
and
only
now
we
have
discovered
its
full
and
perfect
definition
for
artifice
is
of
time
but
art
is
of
eternity
appendix
poe
was
not
altogether
right
in
saying
that
the
object
of
poetry
was
beauty
as
distinguished
from
truth
i
do
for
a
moment
suppose
that
his
meaning
was
amiss
but
i
hardly
like
his
expression
of
it
i
should
contend
on
the
other
hand
that
poetry
κατ
ἐξοχήν
and
literature
generally
are
the
sole
media
by
which
the
very
highest
truth
can
be
conveyed
poe
no
doubt
meant
to
state
a
proposition
which
is
true
and
that
poetry
has
nothing
to
do
with
scientific
truth
or
facts
or
information
of
any
kind
and
i
say
that
that
proposition
is
because
we
have
already
seen
that
in
literature
facts
as
facts
have
no
existence
at
all
they
are
only
words
in
the
language
of
literary
art
and
are
used
as
symbols
of
something
else
that
is
in
love
with
is
a
scientific
truth
a
fact
but
if
it
be
not
also
a
symbol
it
has
no
literary
existence
whatever
and
this
of
course
is
what
poe
wished
to
say
literature
is
not
a
matter
of
information
but
i
doubt
after
all
whether
poe
had
quite
grasped
the
theory
of
literature
of
all
the
arts
you
remember
that
he
says
that
he
yields
to
no
man
in
his
love
of
the
truth
and
unless
he
meant
the
highest
truth
the
statement
is
almost
nonsensical
no
one
i
should
imagine
surely
not
poe
would
express
his
enthusiasm
for
facts
as
facts
would
adore
correct
information
in
the
abstract
you
remember
what
rossetti
said
that
he
neither
knew
nor
cared
whether
the
sun
went
round
the
earth
or
the
earth
round
the
sun
and
so
far
as
art
is
concerned
this
is
no
doubt
the
expression
of
the
true
faith
which
from
what
we
know
of
poe
would
be
his
faith
also
we
should
therefore
conclude
that
by
truth
he
meant
philosophical
truth
the
highest
truth
the
essential
truth
as
distinguished
from
the
accidental
the
universal
as
distinguished
from
the
particular
yet
in
the
next
breath
he
contrasts
this
truth
with
beauty
being
clearly
under
the
impression
that
they
were
two
different
things
of
course
he
was
completely
mistaken
in
the
last
analysis
it
is
entirely
true
that
beauty
is
truth
and
truth
beauty
they
are
one
and
the
same
entity
seen
from
different
points
of
view
you
will
see
how
this
fits
in
with
all
we
have
been
saying
about
literature
lately
how
we
can
if
we
please
put
our
test
of
literature
into
yet
another
phraseology
for
instance
vanity
fair
is
information
while
pickwick
is
truth
the
one
tells
you
a
number
of
facts
about
becky
sharpe
and
other
people
while
the
other
symbolises
certain
eternal
and
essential
elements
in
human
nature
by
means
of
incidents
and
as
i
said
it
is
doubtful
whether
truth
in
this
its
highest
and
its
real
significance
can
be
adequately
expressed
in
any
other
way
all
the
profound
verities
which
have
been
revealed
to
man
have
come
to
him
under
the
guise
of
myths
and
symbols
such
as
the
myth
of
dionysus
and
truth
in
the
form
of
a
mathematical
demonstration
or
a
rational
statement
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
yet
note
the
profound
vice
of
language
we
are
obliged
to
use
the
same
word
to
imply
things
which
are
separated
by
an
immeasurable
gulf
it
is
true
that
mrs
stickings
sent
away
ethelberta
you
imparted
that
interesting
fact
and
i
rely
on
your
testimony
and
the
don
quixote
is
true
that
is
it
conveys
to
us
by
means
of
symbols
the
verities
of
our
own
nature
but
poe
had
not
grasped
the
essential
distinction
between
literature
and
literature
he
thought
that
poetry
alone
should
be
beautiful
or
as
we
should
say
ecstatic
he
did
not
see
that
the
qualities
which
make
poetry
to
be
what
it
is
must
also
be
present
in
prose
if
it
is
to
be
something
more
than
poetry
of
course
is
literature
in
its
purest
state
it
is
as
i
think
i
once
said
the
soul
without
the
body
at
its
highest
it
is
pure
art
unmixed
with
the
alloy
of
artifice
and
to
carry
on
the
analysis
the
finest
form
of
poetry
is
necessarily
the
lyrical
where
you
get
the
element
of
narrative
you
are
apt
also
to
get
the
element
of
prose
there
have
to
be
passages
linking
the
raptures
together
and
these
will
probably
or
indeed
necessarily
run
on
lower
levels
of
course
primitive
man
had
moods
in
which
rapture
seemed
to
embrace
everything
to
invest
every
detail
of
existence
with
its
own
singular
and
inexplicable
glory
a
meal
by
the
seashore
the
dry
wood
flaming
and
crackling
on
the
sand
the
roasting
goat
flesh
the
wine
dark
and
almost
as
glorious
as
the
sea
itself
a
mere
dinner
of
one
might
think
it
but
it
too
seems
to
have
its
solemnity
and
its
inner
meaning
i
believe
this
element
in
the
early
poetry
has
often
been
noticed
people
have
wondered
at
the
delight
with
which
the
writers
describe
the
work
of
man
hands
and
they
are
i
think
inclined
to
account
for
it
on
the
ground
that
then
everything
was
new
this
might
pass
perhaps
since
as
you
no
doubt
perceive
everything
new
means
everything
unknown
that
which
is
known
is
no
longer
new
but
i
hardly
think
that
the
explanation
can
stand
in
its
present
form
i
am
not
at
all
up
in
the
theories
which
assign
this
or
that
age
to
the
appearance
of
man
on
the
earth
but
i
presume
that
on
the
gentlest
and
most
antiquated
computation
man
must
have
long
known
the
world
before
homer
wrote
so
one
scarcely
sees
that
human
skill
and
art
the
knack
of
making
things
and
the
gift
of
adorning
them
could
have
been
novelties
or
in
any
sense
things
unknown
i
repeat
i
know
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
about
these
dates
in
anthropology
but
one
has
heard
something
about
the
neolithic
age
and
the
palæolithic
age
about
the
very
early
man
who
scratched
the
rude
likeness
of
a
reindeer
on
the
brute
own
bone
and
so
there
hardly
seems
room
for
this
theory
of
novelty
and
besides
as
we
have
seen
the
rapture
is
universal
or
all
but
universal
it
colours
the
whole
of
life
including
the
meal
by
the
seashore
and
there
we
see
there
was
no
possibility
of
invention
or
sense
of
newness
no
the
theory
is
tempting
and
it
would
fall
in
perfectly
as
i
daresay
you
see
with
all
that
we
have
concluded
about
literature
but
i
really
think
that
it
must
be
definitely
abandoned
no
it
seems
to
me
that
primitive
man
homeric
man
mediæval
man
man
indeed
almost
to
our
own
day
when
the
school
board
and
other
things
have
got
hold
of
him
had
such
an
unconscious
but
conviction
that
he
was
a
wonderful
being
descended
of
a
wonderful
ancestry
and
surrounded
by
mysteries
of
all
kinds
that
even
the
smallest
details
of
his
life
partook
of
the
ruling
ecstasy
he
was
so
sure
that
he
was
miraculous
that
it
seemed
that
no
part
of
his
life
could
escape
from
the
miracle
so
that
to
him
every
meal
became
a
sacrament
it
is
the
attitude
of
the
primitive
man
of
the
real
man
of
the
child
always
and
everywhere
it
may
be
briefly
summed
up
in
the
phrase
things
are
because
they
are
wonderful
this
of
course
is
the
atmosphere
in
which
poets
ought
to
live
and
in
which
poetry
should
be
produced
formerly
it
was
natural
to
all
men
or
almost
all
now
perhaps
it
has
to
be
regained
by
a
conscious
effort
and
the
difficulty
of
the
effort
the
impossibility
of
sustaining
it
for
long
explain
the
supremacy
of
lyrical
poetry
if
you
lived
in
a
world
that
could
regard
a
common
meal
as
a
sacrament
you
could
be
supreme
in
narrative
poetry
but
that
atmosphere
wanting
we
have
to
be
content
for
the
most
part
with
the
lyric
with
the
simple
incantation
without
any
description
of
the
circumstance
or
occasion
yet
prose
though
it
yields
in
much
to
the
world
must
still
keep
the
same
ideal
before
it
as
poetry
i
say
distinctly
that
the
only
essential
defining
difference
between
the
two
is
to
be
sought
in
the
numbering
of
poetry
in
the
fact
that
art
in
its
intensest
raptures
in
its
most
truly
natural
moment
desires
and
obtains
the
strictest
and
most
formal
laws
it
is
i
suppose
immaterial
what
these
laws
are
rhyme
assonance
accents
feet
alliteration
all
testify
to
the
important
and
essential
rule
that
freedom
is
chiefly
free
when
it
is
most
bound
and
bounded
by
restrictions
which
should
call
artificial
which
are
in
truth
in
the
highest
sense
natural
and
this
i
am
sure
is
the
only
possible
distinction
that
can
be
established
between
such
a
book
as
the
odyssey
and
such
a
book
as
the
morte
neither
is
prosaic
in
the
common
sense
of
the
word
each
is
poetical
but
the
greek
book
is
poetry
because
it
is
numbered
and
the
english
is
prose
because
it
lacks
number
of
course
there
are
difficult
cases
hybrids
as
there
always
are
whatever
laws
one
may
lay
down
that
word
natural
is
another
of
the
many
traps
that
language
sets
us
i
think
that
its
real
meaning
has
become
almost
reversed
take
the
average
man
to
church
and
ask
him
his
opinion
of
the
intoning
and
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
he
will
say
that
it
may
be
pretty
but
that
it
is
very
unnatural
he
means
of
course
that
speaking
is
natural
and
that
singing
numerosity
of
tone
is
not
natural
is
in
a
word
artificial
he
is
utterly
wrong
it
is
artificial
to
speak
in
the
ordinary
manner
while
the
priests
chant
and
every
chant
are
purely
natural
for
the
proof
of
this
you
have
only
to
read
a
little
a
very
little
about
primitive
or
natural
peoples
or
more
simply
to
listen
to
children
at
play
you
will
always
find
that
where
convention
has
not
cast
out
nature
some
kind
of
some
sort
of
chant
is
the
entirely
natural
utterance
of
man
in
his
most
fervent
that
is
his
most
natural
moments
listen
to
children
children
you
must
remember
are
all
primitives
and
therefore
natural
playing
some
game
learning
their
lesson
at
school
their
voices
are
pretty
sure
to
fall
into
a
very
rude
but
a
distinctly
measured
chant
the
greek
drama
was
intoned
the
koran
is
intoned
the
welsh
preacher
of
at
the
impassioned
height
of
eloquence
begins
to
chant
the
persian
are
recited
in
a
nay
but
listen
only
to
our
great
tragic
actor
quite
unconsciously
i
am
sure
he
has
elaborated
for
himself
a
distinctly
musical
and
measured
utterance
so
that
a
skilful
musician
provided
with
scored
paper
could
note
delivery
of
many
passages
as
if
it
were
music
the
chinese
language
i
am
told
depends
largely
on
the
tonal
variations
which
distinguish
the
meaning
of
one
word
from
that
of
another
you
will
find
the
same
thing
in
the
norwegian
and
the
jewish
cantillation
which
is
in
a
very
simple
form
bears
witness
to
the
truth
that
speaking
is
acquired
conventional
and
artificial
while
singing
is
natural
all
this
would
be
perfectly
clear
in
itself
would
require
no
demonstration
of
any
kind
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
we
have
somehow
or
other
got
into
the
way
of
making
the
very
impudent
assumption
that
man
is
only
natural
when
he
is
doing
business
on
the
or
reading
it
seems
almost
too
nonsensical
an
assumption
to
put
into
words
but
i
really
do
believe
that
at
the
back
of
our
heads
there
is
a
sort
of
vague
floating
idea
that
there
never
were
any
real
men
at
all
till
the
period
of
the
first
reform
bill
and
i
suppose
that
before
very
long
lord
john
russell
will
be
pushed
back
into
the
region
of
myth
and
the
foundation
of
the
school
board
will
be
the
era
of
true
humanity
i
say
this
sounds
too
ridiculous
but
examine
yourself
and
see
whether
you
do
dimly
believe
that
before
the
advent
of
trousers
the
whole
world
was
really
that
existence
in
the
days
of
laced
coats
was
in
a
way
a
kind
of
phantasmagoria
and
that
a
man
who
wore
was
hardly
a
man
i
believe
it
really
is
so
and
you
will
find
the
same
nonsense
influencing
religious
opinion
take
your
average
protestant
and
i
am
much
mistaken
if
you
do
not
discover
that
he
believes
some
grotesque
preacher
in
his
greasy
black
suit
mouthing
platitudes
at
his
conventicle
to
be
somehow
more
natural
than
the
priest
clad
in
the
mystical
robes
of
his
office
chanting
mass
at
the
altar
but
in
literature
why
this
perversion
of
the
word
influences
the
whole
of
criticism
jane
austen
we
say
is
natural
and
edgar
allan
poe
is
unnatural
or
as
it
is
sometimes
expressed
inhuman
of
course
if
you
wish
for
the
truth
the
proposition
must
be
reversed
unless
you
are
willing
to
believe
that
a
company
prospectus
is
somehow
more
natural
and
more
human
than
say
tennyson
fatima
if
you
think
that
the
real
man
is
the
stomach
there
is
of
course
an
end
of
the
discussion
but
then
we
should
have
to
admit
that
all
the
greatest
artists
of
the
world
were
maniacs
but
you
see
clearly
do
you
that
all
these
questions
as
to
what
we
shall
get
for
dinner
and
whom
shall
we
meet
at
dinner
and
in
what
order
shall
we
go
into
dinner
and
how
shall
we
behave
at
dinner
are
in
no
sense
natural
since
they
are
all
so
purely
temporary
since
they
will
be
answered
by
one
age
in
a
manner
that
will
seem
wholly
unnatural
to
the
next
that
i
think
is
truly
natural
which
is
unchanging
which
belongs
to
men
always
at
all
times
and
in
all
ages
in
this
sense
ecstasy
is
natural
to
man
and
it
finds
expression
in
the
arts
in
poetry
in
romance
in
singing
in
melody
in
dancing
in
painting
in
architecture
many
animals
have
sufficient
artifice
to
shelter
themselves
from
the
weather
no
animal
has
architecture
or
the
art
of
beauty
in
building
many
animals
or
all
animals
have
the
faculty
of
communicating
with
one
another
by
means
of
signs
but
man
alone
has
the
art
of
language
has
it
ever
struck
you
while
i
have
been
talking
of
ecstasy
in
books
that
it
is
nearly
always
a
question
of
degree
of
more
or
less
i
think
i
indicated
as
much
while
i
was
talking
about
pickwick
i
showed
how
the
ecstatic
conception
had
been
alloyed
with
much
baser
matter
in
other
words
that
there
was
much
in
pickwick
that
was
by
no
means
literature
and
i
daresay
though
i
am
not
sure
that
if
you
were
to
go
through
your
meredith
you
might
succeed
in
finding
some
passages
and
sentences
which
are
literature
and
for
all
i
know
there
may
be
hints
of
rapture
between
the
lines
of
pride
and
prejudice
still
we
do
not
call
a
man
poet
on
the
strength
of
a
single
line
but
sometimes
one
is
confronted
with
books
which
are
really
very
difficult
to
judge
and
this
sometimes
happens
because
the
ecstasy
the
true
literary
feeling
supposing
it
to
be
present
is
present
not
here
or
there
not
in
a
phrase
or
in
a
particular
passage
but
throughout
in
a
very
weak
solution
if
one
may
borrow
the
phraseology
of
physical
science
we
read
such
books
and
are
puzzled
feeling
that
somehow
they
are
literature
only
we
ca
say
why
since
on
the
face
of
it
they
seem
only
to
be
entertaining
reading
do
you
know
that
i
can
conceive
many
people
who
would
find
something
of
this
difficulty
in
mark
huckleberry
finn
here
you
have
a
tale
of
the
rude
america
of
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
of
a
mississippi
village
full
of
the
most
ordinary
people
of
a
boy
and
a
negro
who
run
away
i
do
think
anyone
with
the
slightest
perception
of
literature
could
read
it
without
experiencing
extraordinary
delight
but
i
can
imagine
many
people
would
be
a
good
deal
puzzled
to
justify
the
pleasure
they
had
received
the
stuff
of
the
book
is
so
very
common
and
commonplace
is
it
it
seems
so
frankly
a
rough
bit
of
recollection
drawn
up
from
the
boyish
days
with
jottings
added
from
the
time
when
he
was
a
pilot
on
one
of
the
it
is
all
so
apparently
devoid
of
literary
feeling
that
i
am
sure
many
a
reader
must
have
felt
greatly
ashamed
of
his
huge
enjoyment
to
me
huckleberry
finn
is
not
a
very
difficult
case
that
flight
by
night
down
the
great
unknown
rolling
river
between
the
dim
marshy
lands
and
the
high
bluffs
of
the
other
shore
comes
in
my
mind
well
under
the
great
odyssey
class
it
has
indeed
the
old
unquenchable
joy
of
wandering
into
the
unknown
in
a
more
acute
degree
than
pickwick
which
as
we
have
seen
is
to
be
reckoned
under
the
same
heading
in
a
word
it
is
pure
romance
and
you
will
note
that
the
story
is
told
by
a
boy
and
that
by
this
method
a
larger
element
of
wonder
is
secured
for
even
in
this
absurd
age
children
are
allowed
to
be
amazed
at
the
spectacle
of
the
world
in
the
mouth
of
a
man
the
tale
would
necessarily
have
lost
somewhat
of
its
strangeness
since
partly
from
affectation
partly
from
vicious
training
partly
from
the
absorption
of
the
process
people
have
largely
succeeded
in
quenching
the
sense
of
mystery
which
should
be
their
principal
delight
you
have
only
to
read
the
average
book
of
travels
to
see
how
this
affectation
or
perversion
of
the
soul
has
deprived
the
seeing
being
of
his
sight
dip
into
a
book
say
a
book
on
china
and
you
will
probably
find
that
pekin
streets
are
dusty
in
summer
and
muddy
in
winter
and
that
the
author
caught
cold
through
imprudent
bathing
so
it
is
well
for
us
that
mark
twain
put
his
story
in
the
mouth
of
an
infant
who
is
frankly
at
liberty
to
express
his
sense
of
the
marvels
of
the
world
later
there
is
an
introduction
of
the
literary
feeling
those
chapters
about
jim
evasion
are
very
cervantic
in
their
artifice
and
method
but
to
my
thinking
they
have
lost
the
spirit
though
they
preserve
the
body
they
are
most
amusing
reading
but
they
are
burlesque
and
nothing
more
than
burlesque
and
from
them
one
can
almost
imagine
what
don
quixote
would
have
been
if
it
had
been
written
by
a
very
clever
man
by
an
artificer
who
was
not
an
artist
but
the
earlier
chapters
are
wonderfully
fine
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
more
successful
rendering
of
the
old
wandering
theme
with
modern
language
but
there
is
another
writer
who
is
much
more
difficult
to
account
for
i
mean
miss
wilkins
i
confess
i
find
her
tales
delightful
and
i
often
read
them
but
as
you
know
i
am
not
content
to
rest
on
my
own
pleasure
in
literary
criticism
we
are
no
longer
talking
of
the
great
masterpieces
of
the
gigantic
achievements
of
such
men
as
homer
sophocles
rabelais
cervantes
we
agreed
that
when
we
spoke
of
these
great
enduring
miracles
of
art
it
was
best
to
lay
aside
all
question
of
liking
or
not
liking
of
reading
often
or
reading
seldom
but
when
one
comes
to
modern
days
to
books
which
have
yet
to
prove
their
merit
by
the
test
of
their
endurance
it
is
pardonable
if
one
is
sometimes
a
little
confused
if
one
fails
to
discriminate
at
once
between
the
merely
interesting
and
the
really
artistic
i
may
be
so
delighted
with
a
book
for
reasons
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
art
that
by
an
unconscious
trick
of
the
mind
i
persuade
myself
that
i
am
reading
literature
while
there
is
only
and
at
one
time
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
i
had
confused
miss
wilkins
in
this
manner
for
on
the
surface
you
have
in
her
books
merely
village
tales
of
new
englanders
tales
often
sentimental
often
trivial
enough
and
sometimes
it
would
seem
of
hardly
more
than
local
interest
hardly
can
one
conceive
the
possibility
of
any
ecstasy
in
these
pleasant
stories
for
they
deal
ostentatiously
with
the
surface
of
things
with
a
breed
of
englishmen
whose
chief
pride
it
was
to
hide
away
and
smother
all
those
passions
and
emotions
which
are
the
peculiar
mark
of
man
as
man
yet
i
believe
that
i
can
justify
my
love
of
miss
wilkins
work
on
a
higher
ground
than
that
of
mere
liking
in
the
first
place
i
agree
with
mr
who
pointed
out
very
well
that
the
passion
does
come
through
the
reserve
and
occasionally
in
the
most
volcanic
manner
he
selects
a
scene
from
pembroke
in
which
the
young
people
play
at
some
dancing
game
called
copenhagen
and
mr
shows
that
though
the
boys
and
girls
of
pembroke
knew
nothing
of
it
they
were
really
animated
by
the
spirit
of
the
bacchanals
that
the
fire
and
glow
of
passion
of
the
youthful
ecstasy
burst
through
all
the
hard
crusts
of
calvinism
and
new
england
reserve
and
we
have
agreed
that
if
a
writer
can
make
passion
for
us
if
he
can
create
the
image
of
the
eternal
human
ecstasy
we
have
agreed
that
in
such
a
case
the
writer
is
an
artist
but
i
think
that
there
are
other
things
more
subtle
more
delicately
hinted
things
in
miss
wilkins
tales
or
rather
i
should
say
that
they
are
all
pervaded
and
filled
with
an
emotion
which
i
can
hardly
think
that
the
writer
has
realised
well
i
find
it
difficult
to
express
exactly
what
i
mean
but
i
think
that
the
whole
impression
which
one
receives
from
these
tales
is
one
of
loneliness
of
isolation
compare
miss
wilkins
with
jane
austen
the
new
england
stories
with
pride
and
prejudice
you
might
imagine
at
first
that
in
one
case
as
in
the
other
there
is
a
sense
of
retirement
of
separation
from
the
world
that
miss
austen
heroines
are
as
remote
from
the
great
streams
and
whirlpools
of
life
as
any
jane
field
or
charlotte
of
massachusetts
but
in
reality
this
is
not
so
the
people
in
the
english
novels
are
in
no
sense
remote
they
are
merely
dull
they
can
not
be
remote
indeed
since
they
are
not
human
beings
at
all
but
merely
the
representatives
of
certain
superficial
manners
and
tricks
of
manner
which
were
common
in
the
rural
england
of
ninety
years
ago
remoteness
is
an
affection
of
the
soul
and
dressed
up
in
the
clothes
of
a
period
can
not
have
any
such
affections
predicated
of
them
and
consequently
though
emma
or
elizabeth
may
appear
very
quaint
to
us
from
the
contrast
between
the
manners
of
the
and
the
they
can
not
be
remote
but
that
does
seem
to
me
the
quality
of
those
books
of
miss
wilkins
the
people
appear
to
be
very
far
off
from
the
world
to
live
in
an
isolated
sphere
and
each
one
lives
his
own
life
and
dwells
apart
with
his
own
soul
and
in
spite
of
all
the
trivial
chatter
and
circumstance
of
the
village
one
feels
that
each
is
a
human
being
moved
by
eminently
human
affections
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
most
important
functions
of
literature
is
to
seize
the
really
fine
flavours
of
life
and
to
preserve
them
as
it
were
in
permanent
form
when
we
were
talking
about
huckleberry
finn
for
example
i
remember
that
i
spoke
of
it
as
the
story
of
a
boy
who
runs
away
but
what
a
curious
magic
there
is
in
these
words
runs
away
does
it
when
you
come
to
examine
the
phrase
exhale
the
very
essence
and
spirit
of
romance
some
time
ago
i
reminded
you
that
the
essential
thing
is
concealed
under
all
manner
of
grotesque
and
unseemly
forms
that
one
can
detect
a
veritable
human
passion
under
the
cry
of
the
shouting
all
the
winners
so
i
think
that
phrase
run
away
carries
to
us
its
meaning
and
significance
for
after
all
what
did
all
the
heroes
of
romance
do
but
run
away
they
left
the
region
of
the
known
the
familiar
fields
or
the
familiar
shores
and
adventured
out
in
the
great
waste
of
the
unexplored
into
the
forest
or
upon
the
sea
here
perhaps
you
have
the
true
interpretation
of
the
phrase
divine
discontent
for
surely
only
that
is
divine
which
revolts
from
the
commonness
of
the
common
life
which
is
conscious
of
things
beyond
of
better
things
of
a
world
which
transcends
all
daily
experience
i
said
once
i
think
that
the
english
passion
for
trading
goes
very
well
with
the
supremacy
of
english
poetry
since
poetry
and
are
but
different
expressions
of
the
one
idea
and
here
again
you
find
confirmation
of
the
theory
in
that
very
marked
english
characteristic
the
desire
of
wandering
of
going
on
and
on
in
the
manner
of
a
knight
errant
or
a
fairy
tale
hero
of
course
in
practice
this
really
divine
impulse
is
corrupted
by
all
kinds
of
earthly
secondary
motions
and
just
as
the
love
of
a
venture
which
is
at
the
root
of
trade
often
or
always
ends
in
a
very
vulgar
wish
to
make
money
and
more
money
and
to
set
up
a
brougham
and
confound
the
smiths
so
the
great
joy
of
exploration
of
running
away
from
the
mapped
and
charted
land
has
for
its
issues
the
development
of
markets
the
progress
of
civilisation
the
profitable
sale
of
poison
and
all
manner
of
base
and
blackguardly
manœuvres
but
of
course
one
expects
all
this
it
is
the
inevitable
mixture
of
the
lower
with
the
higher
which
characterises
all
our
human
ways
still
the
higher
motive
dwells
within
us
i
suspect
indeed
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
higher
the
lower
could
hardly
flourish
and
so
when
you
hear
that
a
boy
has
run
away
to
sea
or
elsewhere
i
wish
you
to
think
kindly
of
him
as
a
survival
of
the
most
primitive
and
important
human
passions
yes
i
think
i
am
right
in
saying
that
the
lower
things
of
humanity
only
flourish
in
consequence
of
the
existence
of
the
higher
take
the
french
nation
for
example
it
is
infinitely
more
bent
on
gain
for
the
mere
sake
of
gain
than
the
english
it
is
ready
to
work
harder
to
give
more
time
to
live
more
unpleasantly
to
eat
less
and
to
drink
less
than
the
english
and
all
in
the
pursuit
of
money
rationally
in
short
the
french
should
be
infinitely
better
men
of
business
than
the
english
and
yet
we
know
that
this
is
not
so
that
the
english
is
the
business
nation
seriously
i
believe
that
this
is
so
because
the
french
are
and
nothing
more
because
they
hate
a
risk
of
any
kind
because
they
abhor
any
kind
of
mercantile
venturing
into
the
unknown
in
other
words
they
engage
in
simply
for
the
sake
of
making
money
they
have
no
joy
of
the
hazard
they
will
never
deserve
the
title
of
merchant
adventurers
and
they
remain
in
truth
a
nation
of
shopkeepers
and
of
shopkeepers
sir
a
man
of
acute
intelligence
would
in
the
seventeenth
century
have
deduced
the
future
state
of
french
and
english
commerce
of
french
and
english
colonization
from
a
comparison
between
shakespeare
and
racine
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
phœnicians
were
shopkeepers
of
the
french
kind
and
hence
their
extinction
their
shadowy
survival
merely
in
the
history
of
their
conquerors
you
think
the
roman
empire
a
formidable
objection
to
my
theory
because
roman
literature
and
roman
art
show
in
general
so
little
of
the
imaginative
adventurous
faculty
i
think
the
objection
formidable
but
i
believe
that
it
can
be
redargued
as
dominie
sampson
used
to
say
the
roman
empire
was
such
a
purely
military
settlement
was
it
it
was
if
one
may
say
so
a
garrisoning
of
the
world
not
in
any
way
a
real
colonizing
in
the
greek
and
the
english
sense
and
in
the
second
place
do
you
know
that
i
have
grave
doubts
whether
we
know
very
much
of
the
roman
spirit
from
the
roman
literature
how
far
into
the
english
character
would
the
works
of
the
excellent
johnson
carry
us
one
hardly
finds
chaucer
the
elizabethans
the
cavalier
poets
keats
or
wordsworth
in
rasselas
and
the
rambler
and
i
have
always
suspected
that
latin
literature
was
in
a
great
measure
johnsonized
periwigged
hidden
and
perverted
by
the
irresistible
flood
of
greek
culture
it
may
be
a
paradox
but
i
have
a
very
strong
conviction
that
the
missal
and
the
breviary
tell
us
more
about
the
true
latin
character
than
cicero
and
horace
but
we
must
be
thankful
that
in
the
sixteenth
and
early
seventeenth
centuries
england
stood
aloof
from
the
continent
of
europe
and
that
when
it
did
borrow
it
transformed
and
transmuted
so
that
the
original
entirely
lost
its
foreign
character
i
always
think
that
change
of
madame
de
querouaille
into
madam
carewell
such
a
wonderful
instance
of
our
nationalism
our
transforming
force
if
it
had
been
otherwise
if
we
had
grovelled
before
the
literature
of
france
or
spain
or
italy
as
rome
grovelled
before
the
literature
of
greece
well
perhaps
english
literature
would
have
meant
chevy
chace
and
a
few
old
ballads
and
the
eighteenth
century
i
hate
the
reformation
but
perhaps
it
saved
our
literature
simply
by
isolating
the
nation
i
claimed
i
think
literary
merit
for
miss
wilkins
because
her
books
give
out
an
impression
of
loneliness
i
think
that
is
so
but
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
loneliness
is
merely
another
synonym
for
that
one
property
which
makes
the
difference
between
real
literature
and
if
you
look
into
the
french
literature
of
the
last
two
hundred
years
and
complain
of
its
elegant
nothingness
of
its
wholly
secondary
character
i
would
point
out
that
it
is
because
it
is
the
expression
not
of
the
lonely
human
soul
like
a
star
dwelling
apart
but
of
society
of
the
of
the
of
polite
company
of
the
and
the
i
am
not
making
an
accusation
i
am
adopting
the
terms
of
the
eminent
de
brunetière
who
tells
us
i
think
that
french
literature
is
beautiful
because
it
is
firstly
sociable
and
secondly
because
it
is
a
kind
of
a
long
talk
to
ladies
i
hardly
think
that
i
need
go
into
the
merits
of
the
question
you
and
i
i
take
it
are
convinced
of
the
vast
immeasurable
inferiority
of
racine
to
shakespeare
with
these
two
names
one
sums
up
the
whole
debate
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
de
brunetière
has
given
the
true
reason
of
the
french
literature
being
on
the
distinctly
low
level
it
is
always
thackeray
it
is
always
pope
it
is
always
jane
austen
it
is
in
our
sense
of
the
word
not
literature
at
all
though
to
be
sure
its
artifice
is
often
of
the
most
exquisite
description
of
course
i
do
not
speak
of
the
ultimate
reason
that
is
to
be
sought
i
presume
in
the
mental
constitution
of
the
nation
but
when
one
reads
de
account
of
the
formation
of
modern
french
letters
and
notes
his
insistance
on
the
social
element
as
the
chief
factor
one
may
be
pretty
sure
that
this
social
factor
is
responsible
for
the
pleasant
nullities
which
we
all
know
you
may
feel
pretty
certain
i
think
that
real
literature
has
always
been
produced
by
men
who
have
preserved
a
certain
loneliness
of
soul
if
not
of
body
the
masterpieces
are
not
generated
by
that
pleasant
and
witty
traffic
of
the
but
by
the
silence
of
the
eternal
hills
remember
we
have
settled
that
literature
is
the
expression
of
the
standing
out
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
soul
it
is
the
endeavour
of
every
age
to
return
to
the
first
age
to
an
age
if
you
like
of
savages
when
a
man
crept
away
to
the
rocks
or
to
the
forests
that
he
might
utter
all
alone
the
secrets
of
his
own
soul
so
this
is
my
plea
for
miss
wilkins
i
think
that
she
has
indicated
this
condition
of
ecstasis
she
has
painted
a
society
indeed
but
a
society
in
which
each
man
stands
apart
responsible
only
for
himself
and
to
himself
conscious
only
of
himself
and
his
god
you
will
note
this
if
you
read
her
carefully
you
will
see
how
this
doctrine
of
awful
individual
loneliness
prevails
so
far
that
it
is
carried
into
the
necessary
and
ordinary
transactions
of
social
life
often
with
results
that
are
very
absurd
many
of
the
people
in
her
stories
are
so
absolutely
convinced
of
their
loneliness
so
certain
that
there
are
only
two
persons
in
the
whole
universe
each
man
and
his
god
that
they
do
not
shrink
from
transgressing
and
flouting
all
the
social
orders
and
regulations
in
spite
of
their
very
strong
and
social
instinct
drawing
them
in
the
opposite
direction
you
remember
the
man
who
vowed
that
under
certain
circumstances
he
would
sit
on
the
steps
every
sunday
he
kept
his
vow
for
ten
years
i
think
and
he
kept
it
in
spite
of
his
profound
horror
of
ridicule
of
doing
what
other
people
did
do
in
spite
of
his
own
happiness
but
he
kept
it
because
he
realised
his
loneliness
because
he
saw
quite
clearly
that
he
must
stand
or
fall
by
his
own
word
and
his
own
promise
and
that
the
opinions
of
others
could
be
of
no
possible
importance
to
him
the
instance
is
ludicrous
even
to
the
verge
of
farce
and
yet
i
call
it
a
witness
to
the
everlasting
truth
that
at
last
each
man
must
stand
or
fall
alone
and
that
if
he
would
stand
he
must
to
a
certain
extent
live
alone
with
his
own
soul
it
is
from
this
mood
of
lonely
reverie
and
ecstasy
that
literature
proceeds
and
i
think
that
the
sense
of
all
this
is
diffused
throughout
miss
wilkins
new
england
stories
you
ask
me
for
a
new
test
or
rather
for
a
new
expression
of
the
one
test
that
separates
literature
from
the
mass
of
stuff
which
is
not
literature
i
will
give
you
a
test
that
will
startle
you
literature
is
the
expression
through
the
æsthetic
medium
of
words
of
the
dogmas
of
the
catholic
church
and
that
which
in
any
way
is
out
of
harmony
with
these
dogmas
is
not
literature
yes
it
is
really
so
but
not
exactly
in
the
sense
which
you
suppose
no
literal
compliance
with
christianity
is
needed
no
nor
even
an
acquaintance
with
the
doctrines
of
christianity
the
greeks
celebrating
the
festivals
of
dionysus
cervantes
recounting
the
fooleries
of
don
quixote
dickens
measuring
mr
pickwick
glasses
of
cold
punch
rabelais
with
his
thirsty
pantagruel
were
all
sufficiently
catholic
from
our
point
of
view
and
the
cultus
of
aphrodite
is
merely
a
symbol
misunderstood
and
possibly
corrupted
and
if
you
can
describe
an
initiatory
dance
of
savages
in
the
proper
manner
i
shall
call
you
a
good
catholic
you
say
that
robert
elsmere
is
not
literature
and
you
are
perfectly
right
but
i
hope
you
do
condemn
it
because
it
contains
arguments
directed
against
the
catholic
faith
these
from
our
own
standpoint
are
simply
nothing
at
all
not
reckoning
either
way
we
pass
them
over
just
as
we
should
pass
over
a
passage
on
quadratic
equations
pleasantly
interpolated
by
an
author
into
the
body
of
his
romance
the
conscious
opinions
of
a
writer
are
simply
not
worth
twopence
in
the
court
of
literature
who
cares
to
enquire
into
the
theology
of
keats
but
when
we
find
not
only
the
consciousness
but
also
the
subconsciousness
permeated
by
the
impression
that
man
is
a
logical
rationalistic
creature
and
nothing
more
when
the
total
impression
of
the
human
being
gathered
from
the
book
is
of
a
simply
demonstrating
and
demonstrable
animal
then
we
may
be
perfectly
assured
that
we
have
not
to
deal
with
literature
it
is
the
subconsciousness
remember
alone
that
matters
and
to
put
it
again
theologically
you
will
find
that
books
which
are
not
literature
proceed
from
ignorance
of
the
sacramental
system
thackeray
was
an
unconscious
heretic
while
george
eliot
was
a
conscious
one
but
each
was
ignorant
of
the
meaning
of
sacramentalism
and
so
making
allowance
for
the
fact
that
the
one
was
a
clever
man
while
the
other
was
a
dull
industrious
woman
you
have
from
each
a
view
of
life
that
is
substantially
the
same
and
entirely
false
each
was
profoundly
convinced
that
there
milestones
on
the
dover
road
and
each
in
his
several
way
was
so
intent
on
the
truth
of
this
proposition
and
it
a
perfectly
true
one
that
the
secret
of
the
scenery
and
the
secret
of
canterbury
cathedral
are
altogether
to
seek
in
their
books
certainly
the
gentleman
is
a
delightful
companion
and
the
milestones
seem
few
indeed
while
we
are
on
the
way
while
with
the
other
guide
we
feel
like
a
girls
school
compelled
to
listen
to
the
now
young
ladies
and
the
lessons
which
every
object
on
the
road
suggests
still
the
total
view
is
much
the
same
the
same
in
genus
if
not
in
species
and
you
may
add
flaubert
to
your
companions
on
the
road
and
you
will
be
in
the
same
case
but
read
a
chapter
of
don
quixote
you
will
not
be
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
milestones
since
your
gaze
is
fixed
on
the
mystery
of
the
woods
and
you
are
a
pilgrim
to
the
blissful
shrine
beyond
do
imagine
that
you
can
improve
your
literary
chances
by
subscribing
the
catechism
or
the
decrees
of
the
council
of
trent
no
i
can
give
you
no
such
short
and
easy
plan
for
excelling
but
i
tell
you
that
unless
you
have
assimilated
the
final
dogmas
the
eternal
truths
upon
which
those
things
rest
consciously
if
you
please
but
subconsciously
of
necessity
you
can
never
write
literature
however
clever
and
amusing
you
may
be
think
of
it
and
you
will
see
that
from
the
literary
standpoint
catholic
dogma
is
merely
the
witness
under
a
special
symbolism
of
the
enduring
facts
of
human
nature
and
the
universe
it
is
merely
the
voice
which
tells
us
distinctly
that
man
is
the
creature
of
the
and
the
stock
exchange
but
a
lonely
awful
soul
confronted
by
the
source
of
all
souls
and
you
will
realise
that
to
make
literature
it
is
necessary
to
be
at
all
events
subconsciously
catholic
have
you
noticed
how
many
of
the
greatest
writers
so
far
from
desiring
that
compliment
of
fidelity
to
life
do
their
best
to
get
away
from
life
to
make
their
books
in
ordinary
phraseology
unreal
i
do
not
know
whether
anybody
has
compared
the
facts
before
or
made
the
only
possible
inference
from
them
but
you
remember
how
rabelais
professes
to
derive
his
book
from
a
little
mouldy
manuscript
found
in
a
tomb
how
cervantes
beginning
in
persona
breaks
off
and
discovers
the
true
history
of
don
quixote
in
the
arabic
manuscript
of
cid
hamet
benengeli
how
hawthorne
prologises
with
the
at
salem
and
lights
in
an
old
on
the
documents
telling
him
the
history
of
the
scarlet
letter
pickwick
was
a
transcript
of
the
transactions
or
papers
of
the
pickwick
club
and
tennyson
morte
shelters
itself
in
the
same
way
behind
the
personality
of
an
imaginary
writer
there
is
a
very
profound
significance
in
all
this
and
you
find
a
trace
of
the
same
instinct
in
the
greek
tragedies
where
the
final
scene
the
peripeteia
is
not
shown
on
the
stage
but
described
by
a
messenger
the
fact
is
that
the
true
artist
so
far
from
being
the
imitator
of
life
endures
some
of
his
severest
struggles
in
endeavouring
to
get
away
from
life
and
until
he
can
do
this
he
knows
that
his
labour
is
all
in
vain
it
would
be
amusing
to
trace
all
the
various
devices
which
have
been
used
to
secure
this
effect
of
separation
of
withdrawal
from
the
common
track
of
common
things
i
have
just
pointed
out
one
the
hiding
of
the
author
as
it
were
behind
a
mask
and
in
the
greek
play
the
analogous
talking
of
what
has
happened
in
place
of
visibly
showing
it
but
there
must
be
many
more
from
this
instinct
i
imagine
arises
the
historical
novel
in
all
its
forms
you
make
your
story
remote
by
placing
it
far
back
in
time
by
the
exhibition
of
strange
dresses
and
unfamiliar
manners
or
again
you
may
get
virtually
the
same
effect
by
using
the
remoteness
of
space
by
playing
on
the
theme
far
far
away
which
really
calls
up
a
very
similar
emotion
to
that
produced
by
the
other
theme
of
long
long
ago
or
once
on
a
time
as
the
fairy
tale
has
it
briefly
we
may
say
that
all
strangeness
of
incident
or
plot
or
style
makes
for
this
one
end
and
of
course
you
see
that
all
this
is
only
the
repetition
of
our
old
text
in
another
form
it
is
perhaps
hardly
necessary
to
give
the
caution
that
on
the
principle
of
there
is
nothing
more
melancholy
than
the
book
which
has
the
body
of
fine
literature
without
the
soul
which
uses
literary
methods
without
understanding
you
need
ask
for
proofs
of
that
proposition
our
memories
are
aghast
with
recollections
of
futile
historical
novels
of
the
terrific
school
of
the
two
horsemen
and
every
christmas
brings
its
huge
budget
of
those
dreadful
boys
books
which
carry
commonplace
to
the
very
ends
of
the
earth
and
occasionally
penetrate
to
the
stars
and
in
style
too
what
can
be
more
depressing
than
the
style
which
is
meant
to
be
strange
and
is
only
flatulent
in
many
cases
of
course
such
books
as
i
have
alluded
to
are
mere
survivals
of
tradition
conventions
of
bookmaking
which
bear
witness
to
the
fact
that
pirates
and
were
once
symbols
of
wonder
and
the
extravagancies
of
style
are
probably
to
be
accounted
for
in
the
same
way
at
some
remote
period
it
may
possibly
have
been
effective
to
call
the
sun
the
glorious
orb
and
even
now
some
minds
may
be
made
to
realise
the
strangeness
of
great
flights
of
birds
by
the
phrase
the
feathered
zingari
of
the
air
but
if
one
is
a
little
sophisticated
one
feels
the
pathos
and
the
futility
of
such
efforts
the
writer
has
felt
and
experienced
the
wonder
of
things
the
beauty
of
the
sun
and
the
hieroglyphic
mystery
of
the
figures
that
the
birds
make
in
the
air
and
he
feels
quite
rightly
that
to
describe
wonders
one
must
suggest
wonder
by
words
unfortunately
he
breaks
down
at
this
point
and
falls
back
on
unhappy
phrases
that
give
the
very
opposite
impression
to
that
which
he
wishes
to
excite
here
you
have
the
whole
history
of
poetic
diction
the
instinct
is
in
itself
an
entirely
right
one
and
i
need
hardly
say
that
the
masters
those
who
have
the
secret
can
use
archaic
forms
obsolete
constructions
conventional
phrases
even
with
miraculous
effect
but
the
beginner
would
do
well
to
be
wary
of
these
things
and
to
turn
his
face
resolutely
away
from
flowery
meads
and
all
the
family
of
inversions
how
is
one
to
know
when
such
phrases
may
be
used
if
i
could
give
you
the
answer
to
that
question
i
should
be
also
giving
you
the
secret
of
making
literature
and
from
all
our
talks
i
expect
you
have
gathered
this
much
at
all
events
that
the
art
of
literature
with
all
the
arts
is
quite
incommunicable
many
kinds
of
artifice
even
are
unteachable
i
could
not
write
or
be
taught
to
write
one
of
those
george
eliot
novels
that
i
have
been
abusing
with
such
hearty
good
will
but
art
is
by
its
very
definition
quite
without
the
jurisdiction
of
the
schools
and
the
realm
of
the
reasoning
process
since
art
is
a
miracle
superior
