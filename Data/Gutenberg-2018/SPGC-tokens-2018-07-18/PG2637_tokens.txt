youth

i
what
i
consider
to
have
been
the
beginning
of
my
youth
i
have
said
that
my
friendship
with
dimitri
opened
up
for
me
a
new
view
of
my
life
and
of
its
aim
and
relations
the
essence
of
that
view
lay
in
the
conviction
that
the
destiny
of
man
is
to
strive
for
moral
improvement
and
that
such
improvement
is
at
once
easy
possible
and
lasting
hitherto
however
i
had
found
pleasure
only
in
the
new
ideas
which
i
discovered
to
arise
from
that
conviction
and
in
the
forming
of
brilliant
plans
for
a
moral
active
future
while
all
the
time
my
life
had
been
continuing
along
its
old
petty
muddled
course
and
the
same
virtuous
thoughts
which
i
and
my
adored
friend
dimitri
my
own
marvellous
mitia
as
i
used
to
call
him
to
myself
in
a
whisper
had
been
wont
to
exchange
with
one
another
still
pleased
my
intellect
but
left
my
sensibility
untouched
nevertheless
there
came
a
moment
when
those
thoughts
swept
into
my
head
with
a
sudden
freshness
and
force
of
moral
revelation
which
left
me
aghast
at
the
amount
of
time
which
i
had
been
wasting
and
made
me
feel
as
though
i
must
at
once
that
very
second
apply
those
thoughts
to
life
with
the
firm
intention
of
never
again
changing
them
it
is
from
that
moment
that
i
date
the
beginning
of
my
youth
i
was
then
nearly
sixteen
tutors
still
attended
to
give
me
lessons
jerome
still
acted
as
general
supervisor
of
my
education
and
i
was
being
prepared
for
the
university
in
addition
to
my
studies
my
occupations
included
certain
vague
dreamings
and
ponderings
a
number
of
gymnastic
exercises
to
make
myself
the
finest
athlete
in
the
world
a
good
deal
of
aimless
thoughtless
wandering
through
the
rooms
of
the
house
but
more
especially
along
the
maidservants
corridor
and
much
looking
at
myself
in
the
mirror
from
the
latter
however
i
always
turned
away
with
a
vague
feeling
of
depression
almost
of
repulsion
not
only
did
i
feel
sure
that
my
exterior
was
ugly
but
i
could
derive
no
comfort
from
any
of
the
usual
consolations
under
such
circumstances
i
could
not
say
for
instance
that
i
had
at
least
an
expressive
clever
or
refined
face
for
there
was
nothing
whatever
expressive
about
it
its
features
were
of
the
most
humdrum
dull
and
unbecoming
type
with
small
grey
eyes
which
seemed
to
me
whenever
i
regarded
them
in
the
mirror
to
be
stupid
rather
than
clever
of
manly
bearing
i
possessed
even
less
since
although
i
was
not
exactly
small
of
stature
and
had
moreover
plenty
of
strength
for
my
years
every
feature
in
my
face
was
of
the
meek
indefinite
type
even
refinement
was
lacking
in
it
since
on
the
contrary
it
precisely
resembled
that
of
a
moujik
while
i
also
had
the
same
big
hands
and
feet
as
he
at
the
time
all
this
seemed
to
me
very
shameful
ii
springtime
easter
of
the
year
when
i
entered
the
university
fell
late
in
april
so
that
the
examinations
were
fixed
for
thomas
s
week
easter
week
and
i
had
to
spend
good
friday
in
fasting
and
finally
getting
myself
ready
for
the
ordeal
following
upon
wet
snow
the
kind
of
stuff
which
karl
ivanitch
used
to
describe
as
a
child
following
its
father
the
weather
had
for
three
days
been
bright
and
mild
and
still
not
a
clot
of
snow
was
now
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
and
the
dirty
slush
had
given
place
to
wet
shining
pavements
and
coursing
rivulets
the
last
icicles
on
the
roofs
were
fast
melting
in
the
sunshine
buds
were
swelling
on
the
trees
in
the
little
garden
the
path
leading
across
the
courtyard
to
the
stables
was
soft
instead
of
being
a
frozen
ridge
of
mud
and
mossy
grass
was
showing
green
between
the
stones
around
the
it
was
just
that
particular
time
in
spring
when
the
season
exercises
the
strongest
influence
upon
the
human
soul
when
clear
sunlight
illuminates
everything
yet
sheds
no
warmth
when
rivulets
run
trickling
under
one
s
feet
when
the
air
is
charged
with
an
odorous
freshness
and
when
the
bright
blue
sky
is
streaked
with
long
transparent
clouds
for
some
reason
or
another
the
influence
of
this
early
stage
in
the
birth
of
spring
always
seems
to
me
more
perceptible
and
more
impressive
in
a
great
town
than
in
the
country
one
sees
less
but
one
feels
more
i
was
standing
near
the
window
through
the
double
frames
of
which
the
morning
sun
was
throwing
its
beams
upon
the
floor
of
what
seemed
to
me
my
intolerably
wearisome
schoolroom
and
working
out
a
long
algebraical
equation
on
the
blackboard
in
one
hand
i
was
holding
a
ragged
algebra
and
in
the
other
a
small
piece
of
chalk
which
had
already
besmeared
my
hands
my
face
and
the
elbows
of
my
jacket
nicola
clad
in
an
apron
and
with
his
sleeves
rolled
up
was
picking
out
the
putty
from
the
with
a
pair
of
nippers
and
unfastening
the
screws
the
window
looked
out
upon
the
little
garden
at
length
his
occupation
and
the
noise
which
he
was
making
over
it
arrested
my
attention
at
the
moment
i
was
in
a
very
cross
dissatisfied
frame
of
mind
for
nothing
seemed
to
be
going
right
with
me
i
had
made
a
mistake
at
the
very
beginning
of
my
algebra
and
so
should
have
to
work
it
out
again
twice
i
had
let
the
chalk
drop
i
was
conscious
that
my
hands
and
face
were
whitened
all
over
the
sponge
had
rolled
away
into
a
corner
and
the
noise
of
nicola
s
operations
was
fast
getting
on
my
nerves
i
had
a
feeling
as
though
i
wanted
to
fly
into
a
temper
and
grumble
at
some
one
so
i
threw
down
chalk
and
algebra
alike
and
began
to
pace
the
room
then
suddenly
i
remembered
that
we
were
to
go
to
confession
and
that
therefore
i
must
refrain
from
doing
anything
wrong
next
with
equal
suddenness
i
relapsed
into
an
extraordinarily
goodhumoured
frame
of
mind
and
walked
across
to
nicola
let
me
help
you
nicola
i
said
trying
to
speak
as
pleasantly
as
i
possibly
could
the
idea
that
i
was
performing
a
meritorious
action
in
thus
suppressing
my
and
offering
to
help
him
increased
my
all
the
more
by
this
time
the
putty
had
been
chipped
out
and
the
screws
removed
yet
though
nicola
pulled
with
might
and
main
at
the
the
refused
to
budge
if
it
comes
out
as
soon
as
he
and
i
begin
to
pull
at
it
together
i
thought
it
will
be
rather
a
shame
as
then
i
shall
have
nothing
more
of
the
kind
to
do
suddenly
the
frame
yielded
a
little
at
one
side
and
came
out
where
shall
i
put
it
i
said
let
me
see
to
it
if
you
please
replied
nicola
evidently
surprised
as
well
as
seemingly
not
at
my
zeal
we
must
not
leave
it
here
but
carry
it
away
to
the
where
i
keep
all
the
frames
stored
and
oh
but
i
can
manage
it
i
said
as
i
lifted
it
up
i
verily
believe
that
if
the
had
been
a
couple
of
versts
away
and
the
frame
twice
as
heavy
as
it
was
i
should
have
been
the
more
pleased
i
felt
as
though
i
wanted
to
tire
myself
out
in
performing
this
service
for
nicola
when
i
returned
to
the
room
the
bricks
and
screws
had
been
replaced
on
the
windowsill
and
nicola
was
sweeping
the
debris
as
well
as
a
few
torpid
flies
out
of
the
open
window
the
fresh
fragrant
air
was
rushing
into
and
filling
all
the
room
while
with
it
came
also
the
dull
murmur
of
the
city
and
the
twittering
of
sparrows
in
the
garden
everything
was
in
brilliant
light
the
room
looked
cheerful
and
a
gentle
spring
breeze
was
stirring
nicola
s
hair
and
the
leaves
of
my
approaching
the
window
i
sat
down
upon
the
sill
turned
my
eyes
downwards
towards
the
garden
and
fell
into
a
brown
study
something
new
to
me
something
extraordinarily
potent
and
unfamiliar
had
suddenly
invaded
my
soul
the
wet
ground
on
which
here
and
there
a
few
yellowish
stalks
and
blades
of
grass
were
to
be
seen
the
little
rivulets
glittering
in
the
sunshine
and
sweeping
clods
of
earth
and
tiny
chips
of
wood
along
with
them
the
reddish
twigs
of
the
lilac
with
their
swelling
buds
which
nodded
just
beneath
the
window
the
fussy
twitterings
of
birds
as
they
fluttered
in
the
bush
below
the
blackened
fence
shining
wet
from
the
snow
which
had
lately
melted
off
it
and
most
of
all
the
raw
odorous
air
and
radiant
sunlight
all
spoke
to
me
clearly
and
unmistakably
of
something
new
and
beautiful
of
something
which
though
i
can
not
repeat
it
here
as
it
was
then
expressed
to
me
i
will
try
to
reproduce
so
far
as
i
understood
it
everything
spoke
to
me
of
beauty
happiness
and
virtue
as
three
things
which
were
both
easy
and
possible
for
me
and
said
that
no
one
of
them
could
exist
without
the
other
two
since
beauty
happiness
and
virtue
were
one
how
did
i
never
come
to
understand
that
before
i
cried
to
myself
how
did
i
ever
manage
to
be
so
wicked
oh
but
how
good
how
happy
i
could
be
nay
i
will
be
in
the
future
at
once
at
once
yes
this
very
minute
i
will
become
another
being
and
begin
to
live
differently
for
all
that
i
continued
sitting
on
the
continued
merely
dreaming
and
doing
nothing
have
you
ever
on
a
summer
s
day
gone
to
bed
in
dull
rainy
weather
and
waking
just
at
sunset
opened
your
eyes
and
seen
through
the
square
space
of
the
window
the
space
where
the
linen
blind
is
blowing
up
and
down
and
beating
its
rod
upon
the
the
shadowy
purple
vista
of
an
avenue
of
with
a
damp
garden
path
lit
up
by
the
clear
slanting
beams
of
the
sun
and
then
suddenly
heard
the
joyous
sounds
of
bird
life
in
the
garden
and
seen
insects
flying
to
and
fro
at
the
open
window
and
glittering
in
the
sunlight
and
smelt
the
fragrance
of
the
air
and
thought
to
yourself
am
i
not
ashamed
to
be
lying
in
bed
on
such
an
evening
as
this
and
leaping
joyously
to
your
feet
gone
out
into
the
garden
and
revelled
in
all
that
welter
of
life
if
you
have
then
you
can
imagine
for
yourself
the
overpowering
sensation
which
was
then
possessing
me
iii
dreams
i
will
make
my
confession
and
purge
myself
of
every
sin
i
thought
to
myself
nor
will
i
ever
commit
another
at
this
point
i
recalled
all
the
peccadilloes
which
most
troubled
my
conscience
i
will
go
to
church
regularly
every
sunday
as
well
as
read
the
gospel
at
the
close
of
every
hour
throughout
the
day
what
is
more
i
will
set
aside
out
of
the
cheque
which
i
shall
receive
each
month
after
i
have
gone
to
the
university
roubles
a
tenth
of
my
monthly
allowance
for
people
who
are
poor
but
not
exactly
beggars
yet
without
letting
any
one
know
anything
about
it
yes
i
will
begin
to
look
out
for
people
like
that
orphans
or
old
women
at
once
yet
never
tell
a
soul
what
i
am
doing
for
them
also
i
will
have
a
room
here
of
my
very
own
jerome
s
probably
and
look
after
it
myself
and
keep
it
perfectly
clean
i
will
never
let
any
one
do
anything
for
me
for
every
one
is
just
a
human
being
like
myself
likewise
i
will
walk
every
day
not
drive
to
the
university
even
if
some
one
gives
me
a
drozhki
russian
phaeton
i
will
sell
it
and
devote
the
money
to
the
poor
everything
i
will
do
exactly
and
always
what
that
always
meant
i
could
not
possibly
have
said
but
at
least
i
had
a
vivid
consciousness
of
its
connoting
some
kind
of
prudent
moral
and
irreproachable
life
i
will
get
up
all
my
lectures
thoroughly
and
go
over
all
the
subjects
beforehand
so
that
at
the
end
of
my
first
course
i
may
come
out
top
and
write
a
thesis
during
my
second
course
also
i
will
get
up
everything
beforehand
so
that
i
may
soon
be
transferred
to
the
third
course
and
at
eighteen
come
out
top
in
the
examinations
and
receive
two
gold
medals
and
go
on
to
be
master
of
arts
and
doctor
and
the
first
scholar
in
europe
yes
in
all
europe
i
mean
to
be
the
first
well
what
next
i
asked
myself
at
this
point
suddenly
it
struck
me
that
dreams
of
this
sort
were
a
form
of
pride
a
sin
which
i
should
have
to
confess
to
the
priest
that
very
evening
so
i
returned
to
the
original
thread
of
my
meditations
when
getting
up
my
lectures
i
will
go
to
the
vorobievi
gori
sparrow
hills
a
public
park
near
moscow
and
choose
some
spot
under
a
tree
and
read
my
lectures
over
there
sometimes
i
will
take
with
me
something
to
eat
cheese
or
a
pie
from
pedotti
s
or
something
of
the
kind
after
that
i
will
sleep
a
little
and
then
read
some
good
book
or
other
or
else
draw
pictures
or
play
on
some
instrument
certainly
i
must
learn
to
play
the
flute
perhaps
she
too
will
be
walking
on
the
vorobievi
gori
and
will
approach
me
one
day
and
say
who
are
you
and
i
shall
look
at
her
oh
so
sadly
and
say
that
i
am
the
son
of
a
priest
and
that
i
am
happy
only
when
i
am
there
alone
quite
alone
then
she
will
give
me
her
hand
and
say
something
to
me
and
sit
down
beside
me
so
every
day
we
shall
go
to
the
same
spot
and
be
friends
together
and
i
shall
kiss
her
but
no
that
would
not
be
right
on
the
contrary
from
this
day
forward
i
never
mean
to
look
at
a
woman
again
never
never
again
do
i
mean
to
walk
with
a
girl
nor
even
to
go
near
one
if
i
can
help
it
yet
of
course
in
three
years
time
when
i
have
come
of
age
i
shall
marry
also
i
mean
to
take
as
much
exercise
as
ever
i
can
and
to
do
gymnastics
every
day
so
that
when
i
have
turned
i
shall
be
stronger
even
than
rappo
on
my
first
day
s
training
i
mean
to
hold
out
half
a
pood
the
pood
russian
pounds
at
arm
s
length
for
five
minutes
and
the
next
day
pounds
and
the
third
day
pounds
and
so
on
until
at
last
i
can
hold
out
four
poods
in
each
hand
and
be
stronger
even
than
a
porter
then
if
ever
any
one
should
try
to
insult
me
or
should
begin
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
her
i
shall
take
him
so
by
the
front
of
his
coat
and
lift
him
up
an
arshin
the
arshin
feet
inches
or
two
with
one
hand
and
just
hold
him
there
so
that
he
may
feel
my
strength
and
cease
from
his
conduct
yet
that
too
would
not
be
right
no
no
it
would
not
matter
i
should
not
hurt
him
merely
show
him
that
i
let
no
one
blame
me
because
the
dreams
of
my
youth
were
as
foolish
as
those
of
my
childhood
and
boyhood
i
am
sure
that
even
if
it
be
my
fate
to
live
to
extreme
old
age
and
to
continue
my
story
with
the
years
i
an
old
man
of
seventy
shall
be
found
dreaming
dreams
just
as
impossible
and
childish
as
those
i
am
dreaming
now
i
shall
be
dreaming
of
some
lovely
maria
who
loves
me
the
toothless
old
man
as
she
might
love
a
mazeppa
of
some
imbecile
son
who
through
some
extraordinary
chance
has
suddenly
become
a
minister
of
state
of
my
suddenly
receiving
a
windfall
of
a
million
of
roubles
i
am
sure
that
there
exists
no
human
being
no
human
age
to
whom
or
to
which
that
gracious
consolatory
power
of
dreaming
is
totally
a
stranger
yet
save
for
the
one
general
feature
of
magic
and
impossibility
the
dreams
of
each
human
being
of
each
age
of
man
have
their
own
distinguishing
characteristics
at
the
period
upon
which
i
look
as
having
marked
the
close
of
my
boyhood
and
the
beginning
of
my
youth
four
leading
sentiments
formed
the
basis
of
my
dreams
the
first
of
those
sentiments
was
love
for
her
for
an
imaginary
woman
whom
i
always
pictured
the
same
in
my
dreams
and
whom
i
somehow
expected
to
meet
some
day
and
somewhere
this
she
of
mine
had
a
little
of
sonetchka
in
her
a
little
of
masha
as
masha
could
look
when
she
stood
washing
linen
over
the
and
a
little
of
a
certain
woman
with
pearls
round
her
fair
white
neck
whom
i
had
once
seen
long
long
ago
at
a
theatre
in
a
box
below
our
own
my
second
sentiment
was
a
craving
for
love
i
wanted
every
one
to
know
me
and
to
love
me
i
wanted
to
be
able
to
utter
my
name
nicola
irtenieff
and
at
once
to
see
every
one
thunderstruck
at
it
and
come
crowding
round
me
and
thanking
me
for
something
or
another
i
hardly
knew
what
my
third
sentiment
was
the
expectation
of
some
extraordinary
glorious
happiness
that
was
impending
some
happiness
so
strong
and
assured
as
to
verge
upon
ecstasy
indeed
so
firmly
persuaded
was
i
that
very
very
soon
some
unexpected
chance
would
suddenly
make
me
the
richest
and
most
famous
man
in
the
world
that
i
lived
in
constant
tremulous
expectation
of
this
magic
good
fortune
befalling
me
i
was
always
thinking
to
myself
that
it
is
beginning
and
that
i
should
go
on
thereafter
to
attain
everything
that
a
man
could
wish
for
consequently
i
was
for
ever
hurrying
from
place
to
place
in
the
belief
that
it
must
be
beginning
just
where
i
happened
not
to
be
lastly
my
fourth
and
principal
sentiment
of
all
was
abhorrence
of
myself
mingled
with
regret
yet
a
regret
so
blended
with
the
certain
expectation
of
happiness
to
which
i
have
referred
that
it
had
in
it
nothing
of
sorrow
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
so
easy
and
natural
for
me
to
tear
myself
away
from
my
past
and
to
remake
it
to
forget
all
that
had
been
and
to
begin
my
life
with
all
its
relations
anew
that
the
past
never
troubled
me
never
clung
to
me
at
all
i
even
found
a
certain
pleasure
in
detesting
the
past
and
in
seeing
it
in
a
darker
light
than
the
true
one
this
note
of
regret
and
of
a
curious
longing
for
perfection
were
the
chief
mental
impressions
which
i
gathered
from
that
new
stage
of
my
growth
impressions
which
imparted
new
principles
to
my
view
of
myself
of
men
and
of
god
s
world
o
good
and
consoling
voice
which
in
later
days
in
sorrowful
days
when
my
soul
yielded
silently
to
the
sway
of
life
s
falseness
and
depravity
so
often
raised
a
sudden
bold
protest
against
all
iniquity
as
well
as
mercilessly
exposed
the
past
commanded
nay
compelled
me
to
love
only
the
pure
vista
of
the
present
and
promised
me
all
that
was
fair
and
happy
in
the
future
o
good
and
consoling
voice
surely
the
day
will
never
come
when
you
are
silent
iv
our
family
circle
papa
was
seldom
at
home
that
spring
yet
whenever
he
was
so
he
seemed
extraordinarily
cheerful
as
he
either
strummed
his
favourite
pieces
on
the
piano
or
looked
roguishly
at
us
and
made
jokes
about
us
all
not
excluding
even
mimi
for
instance
he
would
say
that
the
tsarevitch
himself
had
seen
mimi
at
the
rink
and
fallen
so
much
in
love
with
her
that
he
had
presented
a
petition
to
the
synod
for
divorce
or
else
that
i
had
been
granted
an
appointment
as
secretary
to
the
austrian
ambassador
a
piece
of
news
which
he
imparted
to
us
with
a
perfectly
grave
face
next
he
would
frighten
katenka
with
some
spiders
of
which
she
was
very
much
afraid
engage
in
an
animated
conversation
with
our
friends
dubkoff
and
nechludoff
and
tell
us
and
our
guests
over
and
over
again
his
plans
for
the
year
although
these
plans
changed
almost
from
day
to
day
and
were
for
ever
contradicting
one
another
they
seemed
so
attractive
that
we
were
always
glad
to
listen
to
them
and
lubotshka
in
particular
would
glue
her
eyes
to
his
face
so
as
not
to
lose
a
single
word
one
day
his
plan
would
be
that
he
should
leave
my
brother
and
myself
at
the
university
and
go
and
live
with
lubotshka
in
italy
for
two
years
next
the
plan
would
be
that
he
should
buy
an
estate
on
the
south
coast
of
the
crimea
and
take
us
for
an
annual
visit
there
next
that
we
should
migrate
en
masse
to
petersburg
and
so
forth
yet
in
addition
to
this
unusual
cheerfulness
of
his
another
change
had
come
over
him
of
late
a
change
which
greatly
surprised
me
this
was
that
he
had
had
some
fashionable
clothes
made
an
frockcoat
smart
trousers
with
straps
at
the
sides
and
a
long
wadded
greatcoat
which
fitted
him
to
perfection
often
too
there
was
a
delightful
smell
of
scent
about
him
when
he
came
home
from
a
party
more
especially
when
he
had
been
to
see
a
lady
of
whom
mimi
never
spoke
but
with
a
sigh
and
a
face
that
seemed
to
say
poor
orphans
how
dreadful
it
is
a
good
thing
that
she
is
gone
now
and
so
on
and
so
on
from
nicola
for
papa
never
spoke
to
us
of
his
gambling
i
had
learnt
that
he
papa
had
been
very
fortunate
in
play
that
winter
and
so
had
won
an
extraordinary
amount
of
money
all
of
which
he
had
placed
in
the
bank
after
vowing
that
he
would
play
no
more
that
spring
evidently
it
was
his
fear
of
being
unable
to
resist
again
doing
so
that
was
rendering
him
anxious
to
leave
for
the
country
as
soon
as
possible
indeed
he
ended
by
deciding
not
to
wait
until
i
had
entered
the
university
but
to
take
the
girls
to
petrovskoe
immediately
after
easter
and
to
leave
woloda
and
myself
to
follow
them
at
a
later
season
all
that
winter
until
the
opening
of
spring
woloda
had
been
inseparable
from
dubkoff
while
at
the
same
time
the
pair
of
them
had
cooled
greatly
towards
dimitri
their
chief
amusements
so
i
gathered
from
conversations
overheard
were
continual
drinking
of
champagne
past
the
windows
of
a
lady
with
whom
both
of
them
appeared
to
be
in
love
and
dancing
with
her
not
at
children
s
parties
either
but
at
real
balls
it
was
this
last
fact
which
despite
our
love
for
one
another
placed
a
vast
gulf
between
woloda
and
myself
we
felt
that
the
distance
between
a
boy
still
taking
lessons
under
a
tutor
and
a
man
who
danced
at
real
balls
was
too
great
to
allow
of
their
exchanging
mutual
ideas
katenka
too
seemed
now
and
read
innumerable
novels
so
that
the
idea
that
she
would
some
day
be
getting
married
no
longer
seemed
to
me
a
joke
yet
though
she
and
woloda
were
thus
they
never
made
friends
with
one
another
but
on
the
contrary
seemed
to
cherish
a
mutual
contempt
in
general
when
katenka
was
at
home
alone
nothing
but
novels
amused
her
and
they
but
slightly
but
as
soon
as
ever
a
visitor
of
the
opposite
sex
called
she
at
once
grew
lively
and
amiable
and
used
her
eyes
for
saying
things
which
i
could
not
then
understand
it
was
only
later
when
she
one
day
informed
me
in
conversation
that
the
only
thing
a
girl
was
allowed
to
indulge
in
was
coquetry
coquetry
of
the
eyes
i
mean
that
i
understood
those
strange
contortions
of
her
features
which
to
every
one
else
had
seemed
a
matter
for
no
surprise
at
all
lubotshka
also
had
begun
to
wear
what
was
almost
a
long
dress
a
dress
which
almost
concealed
her
feet
yet
she
still
remained
as
ready
a
weeper
as
ever
she
dreamed
now
of
marrying
not
a
hussar
but
a
singer
or
an
instrumentalist
and
accordingly
applied
herself
to
her
music
with
greater
diligence
than
ever
jerome
who
knew
that
he
was
going
to
remain
with
us
only
until
my
examinations
were
over
and
so
had
obtained
for
himself
a
new
post
in
the
family
of
some
count
or
another
now
looked
with
contempt
upon
the
members
of
our
household
he
stayed
indoors
very
little
took
to
smoking
cigarettes
then
all
the
rage
and
was
for
ever
whistling
lively
tunes
on
the
edge
of
a
card
mimi
daily
grew
more
and
more
despondent
as
though
now
that
we
were
beginning
to
grow
up
she
looked
for
nothing
good
from
any
one
or
anything
when
on
the
day
of
which
i
am
speaking
i
went
in
to
luncheon
i
found
only
mimi
katenka
lubotshka
and
jerome
in
the
papa
was
away
and
woloda
in
his
own
room
doing
some
preparation
work
for
his
examinations
in
company
with
a
party
of
his
comrades
wherefore
he
had
requested
that
lunch
should
be
sent
to
him
there
of
late
mimi
had
usually
taken
the
head
of
the
table
and
as
none
of
us
had
any
respect
for
her
luncheon
had
lost
most
of
its
refinement
and
charm
that
is
to
say
the
meal
was
no
longer
what
it
had
been
in
mamma
s
or
our
grandmother
s
time
namely
a
kind
of
rite
which
brought
all
the
family
together
at
a
given
hour
and
divided
the
day
into
two
halves
we
allowed
ourselves
to
come
in
as
late
as
the
second
course
to
drink
wine
in
tumblers
jerome
himself
set
us
the
example
to
roll
about
on
our
chairs
to
depart
without
saying
grace
and
so
on
in
fact
luncheon
had
ceased
to
be
a
family
ceremony
in
the
old
days
at
petrovskoe
every
one
had
been
used
to
wash
and
dress
for
the
meal
and
then
to
repair
to
the
as
the
appointed
hour
two
o
clock
drew
near
and
pass
the
time
of
waiting
in
lively
conversation
just
as
the
clock
in
the
servants
hall
was
beginning
to
whirr
before
striking
the
hour
foka
would
enter
with
noiseless
footsteps
and
throwing
his
napkin
over
his
arm
and
assuming
a
dignified
rather
severe
expression
would
say
in
loud
measured
tones
luncheon
is
ready
thereupon
with
pleased
cheerful
faces
we
would
form
a
procession
the
elders
going
first
and
the
juniors
following
and
with
much
rustling
of
starched
petticoats
and
subdued
creaking
of
boots
and
shoes
would
proceed
to
the
where
still
talking
in
undertones
the
company
would
seat
themselves
in
their
accustomed
places
or
again
at
moscow
we
would
all
of
us
be
standing
before
the
table
in
the
hall
talking
quietly
among
ourselves
as
we
waited
for
our
grandmother
whom
the
butler
gabriel
had
gone
to
acquaint
with
the
fact
that
luncheon
was
ready
suddenly
the
door
would
open
there
would
come
the
faint
swish
of
a
dress
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
our
grandmother
dressed
in
a
trimmed
with
a
quaint
old
lilac
bow
and
wearing
either
a
smile
or
a
severe
expression
on
her
face
according
as
the
state
of
her
health
inclined
her
would
issue
from
her
room
gabriel
would
hasten
to
precede
her
to
her
the
other
chairs
would
make
a
scraping
sound
and
with
a
feeling
as
though
a
cold
shiver
the
precursor
of
appetite
were
running
down
one
s
back
one
would
seize
upon
one
s
damp
starched
napkin
nibble
a
morsel
or
two
of
bread
and
rubbing
one
s
hands
softly
under
the
table
gaze
with
eager
radiant
impatience
at
the
steaming
plates
of
soup
which
the
butler
was
beginning
to
dispense
in
order
of
ranks
and
ages
or
according
to
the
favour
of
our
grandmother
on
the
present
occasion
however
i
was
conscious
of
neither
excitement
nor
pleasure
when
i
went
in
to
luncheon
even
the
mingled
chatter
of
mimi
the
girls
and
jerome
about
the
horrible
boots
of
our
russian
tutor
the
pleated
dresses
worn
by
the
young
princesses
kornakoff
and
so
forth
chatter
which
at
any
other
time
would
have
filled
me
with
a
sincerity
of
contempt
which
i
should
have
been
at
no
pains
to
conceal
at
all
events
so
far
as
lubotshka
and
katenka
were
concerned
failed
to
shake
the
benevolent
frame
of
mind
into
which
i
had
fallen
i
was
unusually
that
day
and
listened
to
everything
with
a
smile
and
a
studied
air
of
kindness
even
when
i
asked
for
the
kvas
i
did
so
politely
while
i
lost
not
a
moment
in
agreeing
with
jerome
when
he
told
me
that
it
was
undoubtedly
more
correct
to
say
je
peux
than
je
yet
i
must
confess
to
a
certain
disappointment
at
finding
that
no
one
paid
any
particular
attention
to
my
politeness
and
after
luncheon
lubotshka
showed
me
a
paper
on
which
she
had
written
down
a
list
of
her
sins
upon
which
i
observed
that
although
the
idea
was
excellent
so
far
as
it
went
it
would
be
still
better
for
her
to
write
down
her
sins
on
her
soul
a
very
different
why
is
it
a
very
different
matter
asked
lubotshka
never
mind
that
is
all
right
you
do
not
understand
me
and
i
went
upstairs
to
my
room
telling
jerome
that
i
was
going
to
work
but
in
reality
purposing
to
occupy
the
hour
and
a
half
before
confession
time
in
writing
down
a
list
of
my
daily
tasks
and
duties
which
should
last
me
all
my
life
together
with
a
statement
of
my
life
s
aim
and
the
rules
by
which
i
meant
unswervingly
to
be
guided
my
rules
i
took
some
sheets
of
paper
and
tried
first
of
all
to
make
a
list
of
my
tasks
and
duties
for
the
coming
year
the
paper
needed
ruling
but
as
i
could
not
find
the
ruler
i
had
to
use
a
latin
dictionary
instead
the
result
was
that
when
i
had
drawn
the
pen
along
the
edge
of
the
dictionary
and
removed
the
latter
i
found
that
in
place
of
a
line
i
had
only
made
an
oblong
smudge
on
the
paper
since
the
dictionary
was
not
long
enough
to
reach
across
it
and
the
pen
had
slipped
round
the
soft
yielding
corner
of
the
book
thereupon
i
took
another
piece
of
paper
and
by
carefully
manipulating
the
dictionary
contrived
to
rule
what
at
least
resembled
lines
dividing
my
duties
into
three
sections
my
duties
to
myself
my
duties
to
my
neighbour
and
my
duties
to
god
i
started
to
indite
a
list
of
the
first
of
those
sections
but
they
seemed
to
me
so
numerous
and
therefore
requiring
to
be
divided
into
so
many
species
and
subdivisions
that
i
thought
i
had
better
first
of
all
write
down
the
heading
of
rules
of
my
life
before
proceeding
to
their
detailed
inscription
accordingly
i
proceeded
to
write
rules
of
my
life
on
the
outside
of
the
six
sheets
of
paper
which
i
had
made
into
a
sort
of
folio
but
the
words
came
out
in
such
a
crooked
and
uneven
scrawl
that
for
long
i
sat
debating
the
question
shall
i
write
them
again
for
long
sat
in
agonised
contemplation
of
the
ragged
handwriting
and
disfigured
why
was
it
that
all
the
beauty
and
clarity
which
my
soul
then
contained
came
out
so
misshapenly
on
paper
as
in
life
itself
just
when
i
was
wishing
to
apply
those
qualities
to
what
i
was
thinking
at
the
moment
the
priest
is
here
so
please
come
downstairs
and
hear
his
directions
said
nicola
as
he
entered
hurriedly
concealing
my
folio
under
the
i
looked
at
myself
in
the
mirror
combed
my
hair
upwards
i
imagined
this
to
give
me
a
pensive
air
and
descended
to
the
divannaia
room
with
divans
or
where
the
table
stood
covered
with
a
cloth
and
had
an
ikon
and
candles
placed
upon
it
papa
entered
just
as
i
did
but
by
another
door
whereupon
the
priest
a
old
monk
with
a
severe
elderly
face
blessed
him
and
papa
kissed
his
small
squat
wizened
hand
i
did
the
same
go
and
call
woldemar
said
papa
where
is
he
wait
a
minute
though
perhaps
he
is
preparing
for
the
communion
at
the
university
no
he
is
with
the
prince
said
katenka
and
glanced
at
lubotshka
suddenly
the
latter
blushed
for
some
reason
or
another
and
then
frowned
finally
pretending
that
she
was
not
well
she
left
the
room
and
i
followed
her
in
the
she
halted
and
began
to
pencil
something
fresh
on
her
paper
of
peccadilloes
well
what
new
sin
have
you
gone
and
committed
i
asked
nothing
she
replied
with
another
blush
all
at
once
we
heard
dimitri
s
voice
raised
in
the
hall
as
he
took
his
leave
of
woloda
it
seems
to
me
you
are
always
experiencing
some
new
temptation
said
katenka
who
had
entered
the
room
behind
us
and
now
stood
looking
at
lubotshka
what
was
the
matter
with
my
sister
i
could
not
conceive
but
she
was
now
so
agitated
that
the
tears
were
starting
from
her
eyes
finally
her
confusion
grew
uncontrollable
and
vented
itself
in
rage
against
both
herself
and
katenka
who
appeared
to
be
teasing
her
any
one
can
see
that
you
are
a
foreigner
she
cried
nothing
offended
katenka
so
much
as
to
be
called
by
that
term
which
is
why
lubotshka
used
it
just
because
i
have
the
secret
of
which
you
know
she
went
on
with
anger
ringing
through
her
tone
you
purposely
go
and
upset
me
please
do
understand
that
it
is
no
joking
do
you
know
what
she
has
gone
and
written
on
her
paper
nicolinka
cried
katenka
much
infuriated
by
the
term
she
has
written
down
that
oh
i
never
could
have
believed
that
you
could
be
so
cruel
exclaimed
lubotshka
now
bursting
into
open
sobbing
as
she
moved
away
from
us
you
chose
that
moment
on
purpose
you
spend
your
whole
time
in
trying
to
make
me
sin
i
ll
never
go
to
you
again
for
sympathy
and
advice
vi
confession
with
these
and
other
disjointed
impressions
in
my
mind
i
returned
to
the
divannaia
as
soon
as
every
one
had
reassembled
the
priest
rose
and
prepared
to
read
the
prayer
before
confession
the
instant
that
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
stern
expressive
voice
of
the
monk
as
he
recited
the
prayer
and
more
especially
when
he
addressed
to
us
the
words
reveal
thou
all
thy
sins
without
shame
concealment
or
extenuation
and
let
thy
soul
be
cleansed
before
god
for
if
thou
concealest
aught
then
great
will
be
thy
sin
the
same
sensation
of
reverent
awe
came
over
me
as
i
had
felt
during
the
morning
i
even
took
a
certain
pleasure
in
recognising
this
condition
of
mine
and
strove
to
preserve
it
not
only
by
restraining
all
other
thoughts
from
entering
my
brain
but
also
by
consciously
exerting
myself
to
feel
no
other
sensation
than
this
same
one
of
reverence
papa
was
the
first
to
go
to
confession
he
remained
a
long
long
time
in
the
room
which
had
belonged
to
our
grandmother
and
during
that
time
the
rest
of
us
kept
silence
in
the
divannaia
or
only
whispered
to
one
another
on
the
subject
of
who
should
precede
whom
at
length
the
voice
of
the
priest
again
reading
the
prayer
sounded
from
the
doorway
and
then
papa
s
footsteps
the
door
creaked
as
he
came
out
coughing
and
holding
one
shoulder
higher
than
the
other
in
his
usual
way
and
for
the
moment
he
did
not
look
at
any
of
us
you
go
now
luba
he
said
presently
as
he
gave
her
cheek
a
mischievous
pinch
mind
you
tell
him
everything
you
are
my
greatest
sinner
you
lubotshka
went
red
and
pale
by
turns
took
her
memorandum
paper
out
of
her
apron
replaced
it
and
finally
moved
away
towards
the
doorway
with
her
head
sunk
between
her
shoulders
as
though
she
expected
to
receive
a
blow
upon
it
from
above
she
was
not
long
gone
and
when
she
returned
her
shoulders
were
shaking
with
sobs
at
length
next
after
the
excellent
katenka
who
came
out
of
the
doorway
with
a
smile
on
her
face
my
turn
arrived
i
entered
the
room
with
the
same
vague
feeling
of
awe
the
same
conscious
eagerness
to
arouse
that
feeling
more
and
more
in
my
soul
that
had
possessed
me
up
to
the
present
moment
the
priest
standing
in
front
of
a
slowly
turned
his
face
to
me
i
was
not
more
than
five
minutes
in
the
room
but
came
out
from
it
happy
and
so
i
persuaded
myself
entirely
cleansed
a
new
a
morally
reborn
individual
despite
the
fact
that
the
old
surroundings
of
my
life
now
struck
me
as
unfamiliar
even
though
the
rooms
the
furniture
and
my
own
figure
would
to
heavens
that
i
could
have
changed
my
outer
man
for
the
better
in
the
same
way
that
i
believed
myself
to
have
changed
my
inner
i
were
the
same
as
before
i
remained
in
that
comfortable
attitude
of
mine
until
the
very
moment
of
bedtime
yet
no
sooner
had
i
begun
to
grow
drowsy
with
the
conning
over
of
my
sins
than
in
a
flash
i
recollected
a
particularly
shameful
sin
which
i
had
suppressed
at
confession
time
instantly
the
words
of
the
prayer
before
confession
came
back
to
my
memory
and
began
sounding
in
my
ears
my
peace
was
gone
for
ever
for
if
thou
concealest
aught
then
great
will
be
thy
each
time
that
the
phrase
recurred
to
me
i
saw
myself
a
sinner
for
whom
no
punishment
was
adequate
long
did
i
toss
from
side
to
side
as
i
considered
my
position
while
expecting
every
moment
to
be
visited
with
the
divine
wrath
to
be
struck
with
sudden
death
perhaps
an
insupportable
thought
then
suddenly
the
reassuring
thought
occurred
to
me
why
should
i
not
drive
out
to
the
monastery
when
the
morning
comes
and
see
the
priest
again
and
make
a
second
confession
thereafter
i
grew
calmer
vii
the
expedition
to
the
monastery
several
times
that
night
i
woke
in
terror
at
the
thought
that
i
might
be
oversleeping
myself
and
by
six
o
clock
was
out
of
bed
although
the
dawn
was
hardly
peeping
in
at
the
window
i
put
on
my
clothes
and
boots
all
of
which
were
lying
tumbled
and
unbrushed
beside
the
bed
since
nicola
of
course
had
not
been
in
yet
to
tidy
them
up
and
without
a
prayer
said
or
my
face
washed
emerged
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
into
the
street
alone
over
the
way
behind
the
green
roof
of
a
large
building
the
dim
cold
dawn
was
beginning
to
blush
red
the
keen
frost
of
the
spring
morning
which
had
stiffened
the
pools
and
mud
and
made
them
crackle
under
my
feet
now
nipped
my
face
and
hands
also
not
a
cab
was
to
be
seen
though
i
had
counted
upon
one
to
make
the
journey
out
and
home
the
quicker
only
a
file
of
waggons
was
rumbling
along
the
arbat
prospect
and
a
couple
of
bricklayers
talking
noisily
together
as
they
strode
along
the
pavement
however
after
walking
a
verst
or
so
i
began
to
meet
men
and
women
taking
baskets
to
market
or
going
with
empty
barrels
to
fetch
the
day
s
water
supply
until
at
length
at
the
cross
streets
near
the
arbat
gate
where
a
pieman
had
set
up
his
stall
and
a
baker
was
just
opening
his
shop
i
espied
an
old
cabman
shaking
himself
after
indulging
in
a
nap
on
the
box
of
his
old
wreck
of
a
drozhki
he
seemed
barely
awake
as
he
asked
twenty
copecks
as
the
fare
to
the
monastery
and
back
but
came
to
himself
a
moment
afterwards
just
as
i
was
about
to
get
in
and
touching
up
his
horse
with
the
spare
end
of
the
reins
started
to
drive
off
and
leave
me
my
horse
wants
feeding
he
growled
i
can
t
take
you
barin
sir
with
some
difficulty
and
a
promise
of
forty
copecks
i
persuaded
him
to
stop
he
eyed
me
narrowly
as
he
pulled
up
but
nevertheless
said
very
well
get
in
i
must
confess
that
i
had
some
qualms
lest
he
should
drive
me
to
a
quiet
corner
somewhere
and
then
rob
me
but
i
caught
hold
of
the
collar
of
his
ragged
close
to
where
his
wrinkled
neck
showed
sadly
lean
above
his
back
and
climbed
on
to
the
curved
rickety
scat
as
we
set
off
along
vozdvizhenka
street
i
noticed
that
the
back
of
the
drozhki
was
covered
with
a
strip
of
the
same
greenish
material
as
that
of
which
his
coat
was
made
for
some
reason
or
another
this
reassured
me
and
i
no
longer
felt
nervous
of
being
taken
to
a
quiet
spot
and
robbed
the
sun
had
risen
to
a
good
height
and
was
gilding
the
cupolas
of
the
churches
when
we
arrived
at
the
monastery
in
the
shade
the
frost
had
not
yet
given
but
in
the
open
roadway
muddy
rivulets
of
water
were
coursing
along
and
it
was
through
mire
that
the
horse
went
his
way
alighting
and
entering
the
monastery
grounds
i
inquired
of
the
first
monk
whom
i
met
where
i
could
find
the
priest
whom
i
was
seeking
his
cell
is
over
there
replied
the
monk
as
he
stopped
a
moment
and
pointed
towards
a
little
building
up
to
which
a
flight
of
steps
led
i
respectfully
thank
you
i
said
and
then
fell
to
wondering
what
all
the
monks
who
at
that
moment
began
to
come
filing
out
of
the
church
must
be
thinking
of
me
as
they
glanced
in
my
direction
i
was
neither
a
nor
a
child
while
my
face
was
unwashed
my
hair
unbrushed
my
clothes
tumbled
and
my
boots
unblacked
and
muddy
to
what
class
of
persons
were
the
brethren
assigning
me
for
they
stared
at
me
hard
enough
nevertheless
i
proceeded
in
the
direction
which
the
young
priest
had
pointed
out
to
me
an
old
man
with
bushy
grey
eyebrows
and
a
black
cassock
met
me
on
the
narrow
path
to
the
cells
and
asked
me
what
i
wanted
for
a
brief
moment
i
felt
inclined
to
say
nothing
and
then
run
back
to
the
drozhki
and
drive
away
home
but
for
all
its
beetling
brows
the
face
of
the
old
man
inspired
confidence
and
i
merely
said
that
i
wished
to
see
the
priest
whom
i
named
very
well
young
sir
i
will
take
you
to
him
said
the
old
man
as
he
turned
round
clearly
he
had
guessed
my
errand
at
a
stroke
the
father
is
at
matins
at
this
moment
but
he
will
soon
be
back
and
opening
a
door
the
old
man
led
me
through
a
neat
hall
and
corridor
all
lined
with
clean
matting
to
a
cell
please
to
wait
here
he
added
and
then
with
a
kind
reassuring
glance
departed
the
little
room
in
which
i
found
myself
was
of
the
smallest
possible
dimensions
but
extremely
neat
and
clean
its
furniture
only
consisted
of
a
small
table
covered
with
a
cloth
and
placed
between
two
equally
small
in
which
stood
two
pots
of
geraniums
a
stand
of
ikons
with
a
lamp
suspended
in
front
of
them
a
bench
and
two
chairs
in
one
corner
hung
a
wall
clock
with
little
flowers
painted
on
its
dial
and
brass
weights
to
its
chains
while
upon
two
nails
driven
into
a
screen
which
fastened
to
the
ceiling
with
whitewashed
pegs
probably
concealed
the
bed
hung
a
couple
of
cassocks
the
windows
looked
out
upon
a
whitewashed
wall
about
two
arshins
distant
and
in
the
space
between
them
there
grew
a
small
not
a
sound
penetrated
from
without
and
in
the
stillness
the
measured
friendly
stroke
of
the
clock
s
pendulum
seemed
to
beat
quite
loudly
the
instant
that
i
found
myself
alone
in
this
calm
retreat
all
other
thoughts
and
recollections
left
my
head
as
completely
as
though
they
had
never
been
there
and
i
subsided
into
an
inexpressibly
pleasing
kind
of
torpor
the
rusty
alpaca
cassocks
with
their
frayed
linings
the
worn
black
leather
bindings
of
the
books
with
their
metal
clasps
the
plants
with
their
carefully
watered
leaves
and
soil
and
above
all
the
abrupt
regular
beat
of
the
pendulum
all
spoke
to
me
intimately
of
some
new
life
hitherto
unknown
to
me
a
life
of
unity
and
prayer
of
calm
restful
happiness
the
months
the
years
may
pass
i
thought
to
myself
but
he
remains
alone
always
at
peace
always
knowing
that
his
conscience
is
pure
before
god
that
his
prayer
will
be
heard
by
for
fully
half
an
hour
i
sat
on
that
chair
trying
not
to
move
not
even
to
breathe
loudly
for
fear
i
should
mar
the
harmony
of
the
sounds
which
were
telling
me
so
much
and
ever
the
pendulum
continued
to
beat
the
same
now
a
little
louder
to
the
right
now
a
little
softer
to
the
left
viii
the
second
confession
suddenly
the
sound
of
the
priest
s
footsteps
roused
me
from
this
reverie
good
morning
to
you
he
said
as
he
smoothed
his
grey
hair
with
his
hand
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
besought
him
to
give
me
his
blessing
and
then
kissed
his
small
wizened
hand
with
great
fervour
after
i
had
explained
to
him
my
errand
he
said
nothing
but
moved
away
towards
the
ikons
and
began
to
read
the
exhortation
whereupon
i
overcame
my
shame
and
told
him
all
that
was
in
my
heart
finally
he
laid
his
hands
upon
my
head
and
pronounced
in
his
even
resonant
voice
the
words
my
son
may
the
blessing
of
our
heavenly
father
be
upon
thee
and
may
he
always
preserve
thee
in
faithfulness
and
meekness
i
was
entirely
happy
tears
of
joy
coursed
down
my
face
as
i
kissed
the
hem
of
his
cassock
and
then
raised
my
head
again
the
face
of
the
priest
expressed
perfect
tranquillity
so
keenly
did
i
feel
the
joy
of
reconciliation
that
fearing
in
any
way
to
dispel
it
i
took
hasty
leave
of
him
and
without
looking
to
one
side
of
me
or
the
other
in
order
that
my
attention
might
not
be
distracted
left
the
grounds
and
the
rickety
battered
drozhki
yet
the
joltings
of
the
vehicle
and
the
variety
of
objects
which
flitted
past
my
eyes
soon
dissipated
that
feeling
and
i
became
filled
with
nothing
but
the
idea
that
the
priest
must
have
thought
me
the
young
man
he
had
ever
met
or
ever
would
meet
in
the
whole
of
his
life
indeed
i
reflected
there
could
not
be
many
such
as
myself
of
that
i
felt
sure
and
the
conviction
produced
in
me
the
kind
of
complacency
which
craves
for
to
another
i
had
a
great
desire
to
unbosom
myself
to
some
one
and
as
there
was
no
one
else
to
speak
to
i
addressed
myself
to
the
cabman
was
i
very
long
gone
i
asked
him
no
not
very
long
he
replied
he
seemed
to
have
grown
more
cheerful
under
the
influence
of
the
sunshine
yet
now
it
is
a
good
while
past
my
horse
s
you
see
i
am
a
night
well
i
only
seemed
to
myself
to
be
about
a
minute
i
went
on
do
you
know
what
i
went
there
for
i
added
changing
my
seat
to
the
well
of
the
drozhki
so
as
to
be
nearer
the
driver
what
business
is
it
of
mine
i
drive
a
fare
where
he
tells
me
to
go
he
replied
yes
but
all
the
same
what
do
you
think
i
went
there
for
i
persisted
i
expect
some
one
you
know
is
going
to
be
buried
there
so
you
went
to
see
about
a
plot
for
the
no
no
my
friend
still
do
you
know
what
i
went
there
for
no
of
course
i
can
not
tell
barin
he
repeated
his
voice
seemed
to
me
so
kind
that
i
decided
to
edify
him
by
relating
the
cause
of
my
expedition
and
even
telling
him
of
the
feeling
which
i
had
experienced
shall
i
tell
you
i
said
well
you
see
and
i
told
him
all
as
well
as
inflicted
upon
him
a
description
of
my
fine
sentiments
to
this
day
i
blush
at
the
recollection
well
well
said
the
cabman
and
for
a
long
while
afterwards
he
remained
silent
and
motionless
except
that
at
intervals
he
adjusted
the
skirt
of
his
coat
each
time
that
it
was
jerked
from
beneath
his
leg
by
the
joltings
of
his
huge
boot
on
the
drozhki
s
step
i
felt
sure
that
he
must
be
thinking
of
me
even
as
the
priest
had
done
that
is
to
say
that
he
must
be
thinking
that
no
such
young
man
existed
in
the
world
as
i
suddenly
he
shot
at
me
i
tell
you
what
barin
you
ought
to
keep
god
s
affairs
to
what
i
said
those
affairs
of
yours
they
are
god
s
business
he
repeated
mumbling
the
words
with
his
toothless
lips
no
he
has
not
understood
me
i
thought
to
myself
and
said
no
more
to
him
till
we
reached
home
although
it
was
not
my
original
sense
of
reconciliation
and
reverence
but
only
a
sort
of
complacency
at
having
experienced
such
a
sense
that
lasted
in
me
during
the
drive
home
and
that
too
despite
the
distraction
of
the
crowds
of
people
who
now
thronged
the
sunlit
streets
in
every
direction
i
had
no
sooner
reached
home
than
even
my
spurious
complacency
was
shattered
for
i
found
that
i
had
not
the
forty
copecks
wherewith
to
pay
the
cabman
to
the
butler
gabriel
i
already
owed
a
small
debt
and
he
refused
to
lend
me
any
more
seeing
me
twice
run
across
the
courtyard
in
quest
of
the
money
the
cabman
must
have
divined
the
reason
for
leaping
from
his
drozhki
he
notwithstanding
that
he
had
seemed
so
kind
began
to
bawl
aloud
with
an
evident
desire
to
punch
my
head
that
people
who
do
not
pay
for
their
are
swindlers
none
of
my
family
were
yet
out
of
bed
so
that
except
for
the
servants
there
was
no
one
from
whom
to
borrow
the
forty
copecks
at
length
on
my
most
sacred
sacred
word
of
honour
to
repay
a
word
to
which
as
i
could
see
from
his
face
he
did
not
altogether
trust
basil
so
far
yielded
to
his
fondness
for
me
and
his
remembrance
of
the
many
services
i
had
done
him
as
to
pay
the
cabman
thus
all
my
beautiful
feelings
ended
in
smoke
when
i
went
upstairs
to
dress
for
church
and
go
to
communion
with
the
rest
i
found
that
my
new
clothes
had
not
yet
come
home
and
so
i
could
not
wear
them
then
i
sinned
headlong
donning
my
other
suit
i
went
to
communion
in
a
sad
state
of
mental
perturbation
and
filled
with
complete
distrust
of
all
my
finer
impulses
ix
how
i
prepared
myself
for
the
examinations
on
the
thursday
in
easter
week
papa
my
sister
katenka
and
mimi
went
away
into
the
country
and
no
one
remained
in
my
grandmother
s
great
house
but
woloda
jerome
and
myself
the
frame
of
mind
which
i
had
experienced
on
the
day
of
my
confession
and
during
my
subsequent
expedition
to
the
monastery
had
now
completely
passed
away
and
left
behind
it
only
a
dim
though
pleasing
memory
which
daily
became
more
and
more
submerged
by
the
impressions
of
this
emancipated
existence
the
folio
endorsed
rules
of
my
life
lay
concealed
beneath
a
pile
of
although
the
idea
of
the
possibility
of
framing
rules
for
every
occasion
in
my
life
and
always
letting
myself
be
guided
by
them
still
pleased
me
since
it
appeared
an
idea
at
once
simple
and
magnificent
and
i
was
determined
to
make
practical
application
of
it
i
seemed
somehow
to
have
forgotten
to
put
it
into
practice
at
once
and
kept
deferring
doing
so
until
such
and
such
a
moment
at
the
same
time
i
took
pleasure
in
the
thought
that
every
idea
which
now
entered
my
head
could
be
allotted
precisely
to
one
or
other
of
my
three
sections
of
tasks
and
duties
those
for
or
to
god
those
for
or
to
my
neighbour
and
those
for
or
to
myself
i
can
always
refer
everything
to
them
i
said
to
myself
as
well
as
the
many
many
other
ideas
which
occur
to
me
on
one
subject
or
yet
at
this
period
i
often
asked
myself
was
i
better
and
more
truthful
when
i
only
believed
in
the
power
of
the
human
intellect
or
am
i
more
so
now
when
i
am
losing
the
faculty
of
developing
that
power
and
am
in
doubt
both
as
to
its
potency
and
as
to
its
importance
to
this
i
could
return
no
positive
answer
the
sense
of
freedom
combined
with
the
feeling
of
vague
expectation
to
which
i
have
referred
already
so
unsettled
me
that
i
could
not
keep
myself
in
hand
could
make
none
but
the
sorriest
of
preparations
for
my
university
ordeal
thus
i
was
busy
in
the
schoolroom
one
morning
and
fully
aware
that
i
must
work
hard
seeing
that
was
the
day
of
my
examination
in
a
subject
of
which
i
had
the
two
whole
questions
still
to
read
up
yet
no
sooner
had
a
breath
of
spring
come
wafted
through
the
window
than
i
felt
as
though
there
were
something
quite
different
that
i
wished
to
recall
to
my
memory
my
hands
laid
down
my
book
my
feet
began
to
move
of
themselves
and
to
set
me
walking
up
and
down
the
room
and
my
head
felt
as
though
some
one
had
suddenly
touched
in
it
a
little
spring
and
set
some
machine
in
motion
so
easily
and
swiftly
and
naturally
did
all
sorts
of
pleasing
fancies
of
which
i
could
catch
no
more
than
the
radiancy
begin
coursing
through
it
thus
one
hour
two
hours
elapsed
unperceived
even
if
i
sat
down
determinedly
to
my
book
and
managed
to
concentrate
my
whole
attention
upon
what
i
was
reading
suddenly
there
would
sound
in
the
corridor
the
footsteps
of
a
woman
and
the
rustle
of
her
dress
instantly
everything
would
escape
my
mind
and
i
would
find
it
impossible
to
remain
still
any
longer
however
much
i
knew
that
the
woman
could
only
be
either
gasha
or
my
grandmother
s
old
moving
about
in
the
corridor
yet
suppose
it
should
be
she
all
at
once
i
would
say
to
myself
suppose
it
is
beginning
now
and
i
were
to
lose
it
and
darting
out
into
the
corridor
i
would
find
each
time
that
it
was
only
gasha
yet
for
long
enough
afterwards
i
could
not
recall
my
attention
to
my
studies
a
little
spring
had
been
touched
in
my
head
and
a
strange
mental
ferment
started
afresh
again
that
evening
i
was
sitting
alone
beside
a
tallow
candle
in
my
room
suddenly
i
looked
up
for
a
moment
to
snuff
the
candle
or
to
straighten
myself
in
my
chair
and
at
once
became
aware
of
nothing
but
the
darkness
in
the
corners
and
the
blank
of
the
open
doorway
then
i
also
became
conscious
how
still
the
house
was
and
felt
as
though
i
could
do
nothing
else
than
go
on
listening
to
that
stillness
and
gazing
into
the
black
square
of
that
open
doorway
and
gradually
sinking
into
a
brown
study
as
i
sat
there
without
moving
at
intervals
however
i
would
get
up
and
go
downstairs
and
begin
wandering
through
the
empty
rooms
once
i
sat
a
long
while
in
the
small
as
i
listened
to
gasha
playing
the
nightingale
with
two
fingers
on
the
piano
in
the
large
where
a
solitary
candle
burned
later
when
the
moon
was
bright
i
felt
obliged
to
get
out
of
bed
and
to
lean
out
of
the
window
so
that
i
might
gaze
into
the
garden
and
at
the
lighted
roof
of
the
shaposnikoff
mansion
the
straight
tower
of
our
parish
church
and
the
dark
shadows
of
the
fence
and
the
where
they
lay
black
upon
the
path
so
long
did
i
remain
there
that
when
i
at
length
returned
to
bed
it
was
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
before
i
could
open
my
eyes
again
in
short
had
it
not
been
for
the
tutors
who
came
to
give
me
lessons
as
well
as
for
jerome
who
at
intervals
and
very
grudgingly
applied
a
spur
to
my
and
most
of
all
for
the
desire
to
figure
as
clever
in
the
eyes
of
my
friend
nechludoff
who
looked
upon
distinctions
in
university
examinations
as
a
matter
of
importance
had
it
not
been
for
all
these
things
i
say
the
spring
and
my
new
freedom
would
have
combined
to
make
me
forget
everything
i
had
ever
learnt
and
so
to
go
through
the
examinations
to
no
purpose
whatsoever
x
the
examination
in
history
on
the
of
april
i
entered
for
the
first
time
and
under
the
wing
of
jerome
the
great
hall
of
the
university
i
had
driven
there
with
jerome
in
our
smart
phaeton
and
wearing
the
first
frockcoat
of
my
life
while
the
whole
of
my
other
clothes
even
down
to
my
socks
and
linen
were
new
and
of
a
grander
sort
when
a
swiss
waiter
relieved
me
of
my
greatcoat
and
i
stood
before
him
in
all
the
beauty
of
my
attire
i
felt
almost
sorry
to
dazzle
him
so
yet
i
had
no
sooner
entered
the
bright
carpeted
crowded
hall
and
caught
sight
of
hundreds
of
other
young
men
in
gymnasium
the
russian
gymnasium
the
english
grammar
or
secondary
school
uniforms
or
frockcoats
of
whom
but
a
few
threw
me
an
indifferent
glance
as
well
as
at
the
far
end
of
some
professors
who
were
seated
on
chairs
or
walking
carelessly
about
among
some
tables
than
i
at
once
became
disabused
of
the
notion
that
i
should
attract
the
general
attention
while
the
expression
of
my
face
which
at
home
and
even
in
the
vestibule
of
the
university
buildings
had
denoted
only
a
kind
of
vague
regret
that
i
should
have
to
present
so
important
and
distinguished
an
appearance
became
exchanged
for
an
expression
of
the
most
acute
nervousness
and
dejection
however
i
soon
picked
up
again
when
i
perceived
sitting
at
one
of
the
desks
a
very
badly
untidily
dressed
gentleman
who
though
not
really
old
was
almost
entirely
grey
he
was
occupying
a
seat
quite
at
the
back
of
the
hall
and
a
little
apart
from
the
rest
so
i
hastened
to
sit
down
beside
him
and
then
fell
to
looking
at
the
candidates
for
examination
and
to
forming
conclusions
about
them
many
different
figures
and
faces
were
there
to
be
seen
there
yet
in
my
opinion
they
all
seemed
to
divide
themselves
into
three
classes
first
of
all
there
were
youths
like
myself
attending
for
examination
in
the
company
of
their
parents
or
tutors
among
such
i
could
see
the
youngest
iwin
accompanied
by
frost
and
ilinka
grap
accompanied
by
his
old
father
all
youths
of
this
class
wore
the
early
beginnings
of
beards
sported
prominent
linen
sat
quietly
in
their
places
and
never
opened
the
books
and
notebooks
which
they
had
brought
with
them
but
gazed
at
the
professors
and
examination
tables
with
nervousness
the
second
class
of
candidates
were
young
men
in
gymnasium
uniforms
several
of
them
had
attained
to
the
dignity
of
shaving
and
most
of
them
knew
one
another
they
talked
loudly
called
the
professors
by
their
names
and
surnames
occupied
themselves
in
getting
their
subjects
ready
exchanged
notebooks
climbed
over
desks
fetched
themselves
pies
and
sandwiches
from
the
vestibule
and
ate
them
then
and
there
merely
lowering
their
heads
to
the
level
of
a
desk
for
propriety
s
sake
lastly
the
third
class
of
candidates
which
seemed
a
small
one
consisted
of
oldish
men
some
of
them
in
frock
coats
but
the
majority
in
jackets
and
with
no
linen
to
be
seen
these
preserved
a
serious
demeanour
sat
by
themselves
and
had
a
very
dingy
look
the
man
who
had
afforded
me
consolation
by
being
worse
dressed
than
myself
belonged
to
this
class
leaning
forward
upon
his
elbows
and
running
his
fingers
through
his
grey
dishevelled
hair
as
he
read
some
book
or
another
he
had
thrown
me
only
a
momentary
glance
and
that
not
a
very
friendly
one
from
a
pair
of
glittering
eyes
then
as
i
sat
down
he
had
frowned
grimly
and
stuck
a
shiny
elbow
out
to
prevent
me
from
coming
any
nearer
on
the
other
hand
the
gymnasium
men
were
and
i
felt
rather
afraid
of
their
proximity
one
of
them
did
not
hesitate
to
thrust
a
book
into
my
hands
saying
give
that
to
that
fellow
over
there
will
you
while
another
of
them
exclaimed
as
he
pushed
past
me
by
your
leave
young
fellow
and
a
third
made
use
of
my
shoulder
as
a
prop
when
he
wanted
to
scramble
over
a
desk
all
this
seemed
to
me
a
little
rough
and
unpleasant
for
i
looked
upon
myself
as
immensely
superior
to
such
fellows
and
considered
that
they
ought
not
to
treat
me
with
such
familiarity
at
length
the
names
began
to
be
called
out
the
gymnasium
men
walked
out
boldly
answered
their
questions
apparently
well
and
came
back
looking
cheerful
my
own
class
of
candidates
were
much
more
diffident
as
well
as
appeared
to
answer
worse
of
the
oldish
men
some
answered
well
and
some
very
poorly
when
the
name
semenoff
was
called
out
my
neighbour
with
the
grey
hair
and
glittering
eyes
jostled
me
roughly
stepped
over
my
legs
and
went
up
to
one
of
the
examiners
tables
it
was
plain
from
the
aspect
of
the
professors
that
he
answered
well
and
with
assurance
yet
on
returning
to
his
place
he
did
not
wait
to
see
where
he
was
placed
on
the
list
but
quietly
collected
his
notebooks
and
departed
several
times
i
shuddered
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
calling
out
the
names
but
my
turn
did
not
come
in
exact
alphabetical
order
though
already
names
had
begun
to
be
called
beginning
with
ikonin
and
tenieff
suddenly
shouted
some
one
from
the
professors
end
of
the
hall
go
on
ikonin
you
are
being
called
said
a
tall
gymnasium
student
near
me
but
who
is
this
bartenieff
or
mortenieff
or
somebody
i
don
t
know
it
must
be
you
whispered
jerome
loudly
in
my
ear
my
name
is
irtenieff
i
said
to
the
student
do
you
think
that
was
the
name
they
were
calling
out
yes
why
on
earth
don
t
you
go
up
he
replied
lord
what
a
dandy
he
added
under
his
breath
yet
not
so
quietly
but
that
i
failed
to
hear
the
words
as
they
came
wafted
to
me
from
below
the
desk
in
front
of
me
walked
ikonin
a
tall
young
man
of
about
who
was
one
of
those
whom
i
had
classed
as
oldish
men
he
wore
a
tight
brown
frockcoat
and
a
blue
satin
tie
and
had
wisps
of
flaxen
hair
carefully
brushed
over
his
collar
in
the
peasant
style
his
appearance
had
already
caught
my
attention
when
we
were
sitting
among
the
desks
and
had
given
me
an
impression
that
he
was
not
also
i
had
noticed
that
he
was
very
talkative
yet
what
struck
me
most
about
his
physiognomy
was
a
tuft
of
queer
red
hairs
which
he
had
under
his
chin
as
well
as
still
more
a
strange
habit
of
continually
unbuttoning
his
waistcoat
and
scratching
his
chest
under
his
shirt
behind
the
table
to
which
we
were
summoned
sat
three
professors
none
of
whom
acknowledged
our
salutations
a
youngish
professor
was
shuffling
a
bundle
of
tickets
like
a
pack
of
cards
another
one
with
a
star
on
his
frockcoat
was
gazing
hard
at
a
gymnasium
student
who
was
repeating
something
at
great
speed
about
charles
the
great
and
adding
to
each
of
his
sentences
the
word
nakonetz
the
english
colloquialism
you
while
a
third
one
an
old
man
in
spectacles
proceeded
to
bend
his
head
down
as
we
approached
and
peering
at
us
through
his
glasses
pointed
silently
to
the
tickets
i
felt
his
glance
go
over
both
myself
and
ikonin
and
also
felt
sure
that
something
about
us
had
displeased
him
perhaps
it
was
ikonin
s
red
hairs
for
after
taking
another
look
at
the
pair
of
us
he
motioned
impatiently
to
us
to
be
quick
in
taking
our
tickets
i
felt
vexed
and
offended
firstly
because
none
of
the
professors
had
responded
to
our
bows
and
secondly
because
they
evidently
coupled
me
with
ikonin
under
the
one
denomination
of
candidates
and
so
were
condemning
me
in
advance
on
account
of
ikonin
s
red
hairs
i
took
my
ticket
boldly
and
made
ready
to
answer
but
the
professor
s
eye
passed
over
my
head
and
alighted
upon
ikonin
accordingly
i
occupied
myself
in
reading
my
ticket
the
questions
printed
on
it
were
all
familiar
to
me
so
as
i
silently
awaited
my
turn
i
gazed
at
what
was
passing
near
me
ikonin
seemed
in
no
way
diffident
rather
the
reverse
for
in
reaching
for
his
ticket
he
threw
his
body
across
the
table
then
he
gave
his
long
hair
a
shake
and
rapidly
conned
over
what
was
written
on
his
ticket
i
think
he
had
just
opened
his
mouth
to
answer
when
the
professor
with
the
star
dismissed
the
gymnasium
student
with
a
word
of
commendation
and
then
turned
and
looked
at
ikonin
at
once
the
latter
seemed
taken
back
and
stopped
short
for
about
two
minutes
there
was
a
dead
silence
well
said
the
professor
in
the
spectacles
once
more
ikonin
opened
his
mouth
and
once
more
remained
silent
come
you
are
not
the
only
one
to
be
examined
do
you
mean
to
answer
or
do
you
not
said
the
youngish
professor
but
ikonin
did
not
even
look
at
him
he
was
gazing
fixedly
at
his
ticket
and
uttered
not
a
single
word
the
professor
in
the
spectacles
scanned
him
through
his
glasses
then
over
them
then
without
them
for
indeed
he
had
time
to
take
them
off
to
wipe
their
lenses
carefully
and
to
replace
them
still
not
a
word
from
ikonin
all
at
once
however
a
smile
spread
itself
over
his
face
and
he
gave
his
long
hair
another
shake
next
he
reached
across
the
table
laid
down
his
ticket
looked
at
each
of
the
professors
in
turn
and
then
at
myself
and
finally
wheeling
round
on
his
heels
made
a
gesture
with
his
hand
and
returned
to
the
desks
the
professors
stared
blankly
at
one
another
bless
the
fellow
said
the
youngish
professor
what
an
original
it
was
now
my
turn
to
move
towards
the
table
but
the
professors
went
on
talking
in
undertones
among
themselves
as
though
they
were
unaware
of
my
presence
at
the
moment
i
felt
firmly
persuaded
that
the
three
of
them
were
engrossed
solely
with
the
question
of
whether
i
should
merely
pass
the
examination
or
whether
i
should
pass
it
well
and
that
it
was
only
swagger
which
made
them
pretend
that
they
did
not
care
either
way
and
behave
as
though
they
had
not
seen
me
when
at
length
the
professor
in
the
spectacles
turned
to
me
with
an
air
of
indifference
and
invited
me
to
answer
i
felt
hurt
as
i
looked
at
him
to
think
that
he
should
have
so
undeceived
me
wherefore
i
answered
brokenly
at
first
in
time
however
things
came
easier
to
my
tongue
and
inasmuch
as
all
the
questions
bore
upon
russian
history
which
i
knew
thoroughly
i
ended
with
eclat
and
even
went
so
far
in
my
desire
to
convince
the
professors
that
i
was
not
ikonin
and
that
they
must
not
in
anyway
confound
me
with
him
as
to
offer
to
draw
a
second
ticket
the
professor
in
the
spectacles
however
merely
nodded
his
head
said
that
will
do
and
marked
something
in
his
register
on
returning
to
the
desks
i
at
once
learnt
from
the
gymnasium
men
who
somehow
seemed
to
know
everything
that
i
had
been
placed
fifth
xi
my
examination
in
mathematics
at
the
subsequent
examinations
i
made
several
new
acquaintances
in
addition
to
the
graps
whom
i
considered
unworthy
of
my
notice
and
iwin
who
for
some
reason
or
other
avoided
me
with
some
of
these
new
friends
i
grew
quite
intimate
and
even
ikonin
plucked
up
sufficient
courage
to
inform
me
when
we
next
met
that
he
would
have
to
undergo
in
history
the
reason
for
his
failure
this
time
being
that
the
professor
of
that
faculty
had
never
forgiven
him
for
last
year
s
examination
and
had
indeed
almost
killed
him
for
it
semenoff
who
was
destined
for
the
same
faculty
as
myself
the
faculty
of
mathematics
avoided
every
one
up
to
the
very
close
of
the
examinations
always
leaning
forward
upon
his
elbows
and
running
his
fingers
through
his
grey
hair
he
sat
silent
and
alone
nevertheless
when
called
up
for
examination
in
mathematics
he
had
no
companion
to
accompany
him
he
came
out
second
the
first
place
was
taken
by
a
student
from
the
first
gymnasium
a
tall
dark
lanky
fellow
who
wore
a
black
folded
cravat
and
had
his
cheeks
and
forehead
dotted
all
over
with
pimples
his
hands
were
shapely
and
slender
but
their
nails
were
so
bitten
to
the
quick
that
the
looked
as
though
they
had
been
tied
round
with
strips
of
thread
all
this
seemed
to
me
splendid
and
wholly
becoming
to
a
student
of
the
first
gymnasium
he
spoke
to
every
one
and
we
all
made
friends
with
him
to
me
in
particular
his
walk
his
every
movement
his
lips
his
dark
eyes
all
seemed
to
have
in
them
something
extraordinary
and
magnetic
on
the
day
of
the
mathematical
examination
i
arrived
earlier
than
usual
at
the
hall
i
knew
the
syllabus
well
yet
there
were
two
questions
in
the
algebra
which
my
tutor
had
managed
to
pass
over
and
which
were
therefore
quite
unknown
to
me
if
i
remember
rightly
they
were
the
theory
of
combinations
and
newton
s
binomial
i
seated
myself
on
one
of
the
back
benches
and
pored
over
the
two
questions
but
inasmuch
as
i
was
not
accustomed
to
working
in
a
noisy
room
and
had
even
less
time
for
preparation
than
i
had
anticipated
i
soon
found
it
difficult
to
take
in
all
that
i
was
reading
here
he
is
this
way
nechludoff
said
woloda
s
familiar
voice
behind
me
i
turned
and
saw
my
brother
and
dimitri
their
gowns
unbuttoned
and
their
hands
waving
a
greeting
to
me
threading
their
way
through
the
desks
a
moment
s
glance
would
have
sufficed
to
show
any
one
that
they
were
students
persons
to
whom
the
university
was
as
a
second
home
the
mere
look
of
their
open
gowns
expressed
at
once
disdain
for
the
mere
candidate
and
a
knowledge
that
the
mere
candidate
s
soul
was
filled
with
envy
and
admiration
of
them
i
was
charmed
to
think
that
every
one
near
me
could
now
see
that
i
knew
two
real
students
wherefore
i
hastened
to
meet
them
woloda
of
course
could
not
help
vaunting
his
superiority
a
little
hullo
you
smug
he
said
haven
t
you
been
examined
yet
well
what
are
you
reading
aren
t
you
sufficiently
primed
yes
except
in
two
questions
i
don
t
understand
them
at
eh
what
and
woloda
straightway
began
to
expound
to
me
newton
s
binomial
but
so
rapidly
and
unintelligibly
that
suddenly
reading
in
my
eyes
certain
misgivings
as
to
the
soundness
of
his
knowledge
he
glanced
also
at
dimitri
s
face
clearly
he
saw
the
same
misgivings
there
for
he
blushed
hotly
though
still
continuing
his
involved
explanations
no
hold
on
woloda
and
let
me
try
and
do
it
put
in
dimitri
at
length
with
a
glance
at
the
professors
corner
as
he
seated
himself
beside
me
i
could
see
that
my
friend
was
in
the
best
of
humours
this
was
always
the
case
with
him
when
he
was
satisfied
with
himself
and
was
one
of
the
things
in
him
which
i
liked
best
inasmuch
as
he
knew
mathematics
well
and
could
speak
clearly
he
hammered
the
question
so
thoroughly
into
my
head
that
i
can
remember
it
to
this
day
hardly
had
he
finished
when
jerome
said
to
me
in
a
loud
whisper
a
vous
nicolas
and
i
followed
ikonin
out
from
among
the
desks
without
having
had
an
opportunity
of
going
through
the
other
question
of
which
i
was
ignorant
at
the
table
which
we
now
approached
were
seated
two
professors
while
before
the
blackboard
stood
a
gymnasium
student
who
was
working
some
formula
aloud
and
knocking
bits
off
the
end
of
the
chalk
with
his
too
vigorous
strokes
he
even
continued
writing
after
one
of
the
professors
had
said
to
him
enough
and
bidden
us
draw
our
tickets
suppose
i
get
the
theory
of
combinations
i
thought
to
myself
as
my
tremulous
fingers
took
a
ticket
from
among
a
bundle
wrapped
in
torn
paper
ikonin
for
his
part
reached
across
the
table
with
the
same
assurance
and
the
same
sidelong
movement
of
his
whole
body
as
he
had
done
at
the
previous
examination
taking
the
topmost
ticket
without
troubling
to
make
further
selection
he
just
glanced
at
it
and
then
frowned
angrily
i
always
draw
this
kind
of
thing
he
muttered
i
looked
at
mine
horrors
it
was
the
theory
of
combinations
what
have
you
got
whispered
ikonin
at
this
point
i
showed
him
oh
i
know
that
he
said
will
you
make
an
exchange
then
no
besides
it
would
be
all
the
same
for
me
if
i
did
he
contrived
to
whisper
just
as
the
professor
called
us
up
to
the
blackboard
i
don
t
feel
up
to
anything
then
everything
is
lost
i
thought
to
myself
instead
of
the
brilliant
result
which
i
had
anticipated
i
should
be
for
ever
covered
with
shame
more
so
even
than
ikonin
suddenly
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
professor
ikonin
turned
to
me
snatched
my
ticket
out
of
my
hands
and
handed
me
his
own
i
looked
at
his
ticket
it
was
newton
s
binomial
the
professor
was
a
youngish
man
with
a
pleasant
clever
expression
of
face
an
effect
chiefly
due
to
the
prominence
of
the
lower
part
of
his
forehead
what
are
you
exchanging
tickets
gentlemen
he
said
no
he
only
gave
me
his
to
look
at
professor
answered
ikonin
and
sure
enough
the
word
professor
was
the
last
word
that
he
uttered
there
once
again
he
stepped
backwards
towards
me
from
the
table
once
again
he
looked
at
each
of
the
professors
in
turn
and
then
at
myself
once
again
he
smiled
faintly
and
once
again
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
much
as
to
say
it
is
no
use
my
good
then
he
returned
to
the
desks
subsequently
i
learnt
that
this
was
the
third
year
he
had
vainly
attempted
to
matriculate
i
answered
my
question
well
for
i
had
just
read
it
up
and
the
professor
kindly
informing
me
that
i
had
done
even
better
than
was
required
placed
me
fifth
xii
my
examination
in
latin
all
went
well
until
my
examination
in
latin
so
far
a
gymnasium
student
stood
first
on
the
list
semenoff
second
and
myself
third
on
the
strength
of
it
i
had
begun
to
swagger
a
little
and
to
think
that
for
all
my
youth
i
was
not
to
be
despised
from
the
first
day
of
the
examinations
i
had
heard
every
one
speak
with
awe
of
the
professor
of
latin
who
appeared
to
be
some
sort
of
a
wild
beast
who
battened
on
the
financial
ruin
of
young
men
of
those
that
is
to
say
who
paid
their
own
fees
and
spoke
only
in
the
greek
and
latin
tongues
however
jerome
who
had
coached
me
in
latin
spoke
encouragingly
and
i
myself
thought
that
since
i
could
translate
cicero
and
certain
parts
of
horace
without
the
aid
of
a
lexicon
i
should
do
no
worse
than
the
rest
yet
things
proved
otherwise
all
the
morning
the
air
had
been
full
of
rumours
concerning
the
tribulations
of
candidates
who
had
gone
up
before
me
rumours
of
how
one
young
fellow
had
been
accorded
a
nought
another
one
a
single
mark
only
a
third
one
greeted
with
abuse
and
threatened
with
expulsion
and
so
forth
only
semenoff
and
the
first
gymnasium
student
had
as
usual
gone
up
quietly
and
returned
to
their
seats
with
five
marks
credited
to
their
names
already
i
felt
a
prescience
of
disaster
when
ikonin
and
myself
found
ourselves
summoned
to
the
little
table
at
which
the
terrible
professor
sat
in
solitary
grandeur
the
terrible
professor
turned
out
to
be
a
little
thin
man
with
hair
long
and
greasy
and
a
face
expressive
of
extraordinary
sullenness
handing
ikonin
a
copy
of
cicero
s
orations
he
bid
him
translate
to
my
great
astonishment
ikonin
not
only
read
off
some
of
the
latin
but
even
managed
to
construe
a
few
lines
to
the
professor
s
prompting
at
the
same
time
conscious
of
my
superiority
over
such
a
feeble
companion
i
could
not
help
smiling
a
little
and
even
looking
rather
contemptuous
when
it
came
to
a
question
of
analysis
and
ikonin
as
on
previous
occasions
plunged
into
a
silence
which
promised
never
to
end
i
had
hoped
to
please
the
professor
by
that
knowing
slightly
sarcastic
smile
of
mine
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
contrived
to
do
quite
the
contrary
evidently
you
know
better
than
he
since
you
are
laughing
he
said
to
me
in
bad
russian
well
we
shall
see
tell
me
the
answer
later
i
learnt
that
the
professor
was
ikonin
s
guardian
and
that
ikonin
actually
lived
with
him
i
lost
no
time
in
answering
the
question
in
syntax
which
had
been
put
to
ikonin
but
the
professor
only
pulled
a
long
face
and
turned
away
from
me
well
your
turn
will
come
presently
and
then
we
shall
see
how
much
you
know
he
remarked
without
looking
at
me
but
proceeding
to
explain
to
ikonin
the
point
on
which
he
had
questioned
him
that
will
do
he
added
and
i
saw
him
put
down
four
marks
to
ikonin
in
his
register
come
i
thought
to
myself
he
can
not
be
so
strict
after
when
ikonin
had
taken
his
departure
the
professor
spent
fully
five
minutes
five
minutes
which
seemed
to
me
five
hours
in
setting
his
books
and
tickets
in
order
in
blowing
his
nose
in
adjusting
and
sprawling
about
on
his
chair
in
gazing
down
the
hall
and
in
looking
here
there
and
everywhere
in
doing
everything
in
fact
except
once
letting
his
eye
rest
upon
me
yet
even
that
amount
of
dissimulation
did
not
seem
to
satisfy
him
for
he
next
opened
a
book
and
pretended
to
read
it
for
all
the
world
as
though
i
were
not
there
at
all
i
moved
a
little
nearer
him
and
gave
a
cough
ah
yes
you
too
of
course
well
translate
me
something
he
remarked
handing
me
a
book
of
some
kind
but
no
you
had
better
take
this
and
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
horace
he
indicated
to
me
a
passage
which
i
should
never
have
imagined
possible
of
translation
i
have
not
prepared
this
i
said
oh
then
you
only
wish
to
answer
things
which
you
have
got
by
heart
do
you
indeed
no
no
translate
me
i
started
to
grope
for
the
meaning
of
the
passage
but
each
questioning
look
which
i
threw
at
the
professor
was
met
by
a
shake
of
the
head
a
profound
sigh
and
an
exclamation
of
no
no
finally
he
banged
the
book
to
with
such
a
snap
that
he
caught
his
finger
between
the
covers
angrily
releasing
it
he
handed
me
a
ticket
containing
questions
in
grammar
and
flinging
himself
back
in
his
chair
maintained
a
menacing
silence
i
should
have
tried
to
answer
the
questions
had
not
the
expression
of
his
face
so
clogged
my
tongue
that
nothing
seemed
to
come
from
it
right
no
no
that
s
not
it
at
all
he
suddenly
exclaimed
in
his
horrible
accent
as
he
altered
his
posture
to
one
of
leaning
forward
upon
the
table
and
playing
with
the
gold
which
was
nearly
slipping
from
the
little
finger
of
his
left
hand
that
is
not
the
way
to
prepare
for
serious
study
my
good
sir
fellows
like
yourself
think
that
once
they
have
a
gown
and
a
blue
collar
to
their
backs
they
have
reached
the
summit
of
all
things
and
become
students
no
no
my
dear
sir
a
subject
needs
to
be
studied
fundamentally
and
so
on
and
so
on
during
this
speech
which
was
uttered
with
a
clipped
sort
of
intonation
i
went
on
staring
dully
at
his
lowered
eyelids
beginning
with
a
fear
lest
i
should
lose
my
place
as
third
on
the
list
i
went
on
to
fear
lest
i
should
pass
at
all
next
these
feelings
became
reinforced
by
a
sense
of
injustice
injured
and
unmerited
humiliation
while
the
contempt
which
i
felt
for
the
professor
as
some
one
not
quite
according
to
my
ideas
comme
il
faut
a
fact
which
i
deduced
from
the
shortness
strength
and
roundness
of
his
nails
flared
up
in
me
more
and
more
and
turned
all
my
other
feelings
to
sheer
animosity
happening
presently
to
glance
at
me
and
to
note
my
quivering
lips
and
eyes
he
seemed
to
interpret
my
agitation
as
a
desire
to
be
accorded
my
marks
and
dismissed
wherefore
with
an
air
of
relenting
he
said
in
the
presence
of
another
professor
who
had
just
approached
very
well
i
will
accord
you
a
pass
which
signified
two
marks
although
you
do
not
deserve
it
i
do
so
simply
out
of
consideration
for
your
youth
and
in
the
hope
that
when
you
begin
your
university
career
you
will
learn
to
be
less
the
concluding
phrase
uttered
in
the
hearing
of
the
other
professor
who
at
once
turned
his
eyes
upon
me
as
though
remarking
there
you
see
young
man
completed
my
discomfiture
for
a
moment
a
mist
swam
before
my
eyes
a
mist
in
which
the
terrible
professor
seemed
to
be
far
away
as
he
sat
at
his
table
while
for
an
instant
a
wild
idea
danced
through
my
brain
what
if
i
did
do
such
a
thing
i
thought
to
myself
what
would
come
of
it
however
i
did
not
do
the
thing
in
question
but
on
the
contrary
made
a
bow
of
peculiar
reverence
to
each
of
the
professors
and
with
a
slight
smile
on
my
face
presumably
the
same
smile
as
that
with
which
i
had
derided
ikonin
turned
away
from
the
table
this
piece
of
unfairness
affected
me
so
powerfully
at
the
time
that
had
i
been
a
free
agent
i
should
have
attended
for
no
more
examinations
my
ambition
was
gone
since
now
i
could
not
possibly
be
third
and
i
therefore
let
the
other
examinations
pass
without
any
exertion
or
even
agitation
on
my
part
in
the
general
list
i
still
stood
fourth
but
that
failed
to
interest
me
since
i
had
reasoned
things
out
to
myself
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
to
try
for
first
place
was
stupid
even
bad
form
that
in
fact
it
was
better
to
pass
neither
very
well
nor
very
badly
as
woloda
had
done
this
attitude
i
decided
to
maintain
throughout
the
whole
of
my
university
career
notwithstanding
that
it
was
the
first
point
on
which
my
opinion
had
differed
from
that
of
my
friend
dimitri
yet
to
tell
the
truth
my
thoughts
were
already
turning
towards
a
uniform
a
and
the
possession
of
a
drozhki
of
my
own
a
room
of
my
own
and
above
all
freedom
of
my
own
and
certainly
the
prospect
had
its
charm
xiii
i
become
when
on
may
i
returned
home
from
the
final
the
divinity
examination
i
found
my
acquaintance
the
foreman
from
rozonoff
s
awaiting
me
he
had
called
once
before
to
fit
me
for
my
gown
as
well
as
for
a
tunic
of
glossy
black
cloth
the
lapels
of
which
were
on
that
occasion
only
sketched
in
chalk
but
he
had
come
to
bring
me
the
clothes
in
their
finished
state
with
their
gilt
buttons
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
donning
the
garments
and
finding
them
splendid
notwithstanding
that
jerome
assured
me
that
the
back
of
the
tunic
wrinkled
badly
i
went
downstairs
with
a
complacent
smile
which
i
was
powerless
to
banish
from
my
face
and
sought
woloda
trying
the
while
to
affect
unconsciousness
of
the
admiring
looks
of
the
servants
who
came
darting
out
of
the
hall
and
corridor
to
gaze
upon
me
with
ravished
eyes
gabriel
the
butler
overtook
me
in
the
salle
and
after
congratulating
me
with
much
empressement
handed
me
according
to
instructions
from
my
father
four
as
well
as
informed
me
that
papa
had
also
given
orders
that
from
that
day
forth
the
groom
kuzma
the
phaeton
and
the
bay
horse
krassavchik
were
to
be
entirely
at
my
disposal
i
was
so
overjoyed
at
this
not
altogether
expected
that
i
could
no
longer
feign
indifference
in
gabriel
s
presence
but
flustered
and
panting
said
the
first
thing
which
came
into
my
head
krassavchik
is
a
splendid
trotter
i
think
it
was
then
catching
sight
of
the
various
heads
protruding
from
the
doors
of
the
hall
and
corridor
i
felt
that
i
could
bear
no
more
and
set
off
running
at
full
speed
across
the
salle
dressed
as
i
was
in
the
new
tunic
with
its
shining
gilt
buttons
just
as
i
burst
into
woloda
s
room
i
heard
behind
me
the
voices
of
dubkoff
and
nechludoff
who
had
come
to
congratulate
me
as
well
as
to
propose
a
dinner
somewhere
and
the
drinking
of
much
champagne
in
honour
of
my
matriculation
dimitri
informed
me
that
though
he
did
not
care
for
champagne
he
would
nevertheless
join
us
that
evening
and
drink
my
health
while
dubkoff
remarked
that
i
looked
almost
like
a
colonel
and
woloda
omitted
to
congratulate
me
at
all
merely
saying
in
an
acid
way
that
he
supposed
we
should
now
in
two
days
time
be
off
into
the
country
the
truth
was
that
woloda
though
pleased
at
my
matriculation
did
not
altogether
like
my
becoming
as
as
himself
jerome
who
also
joined
us
at
this
moment
said
in
a
very
pompous
manner
that
his
duties
were
now
ended
and
that
although
he
did
not
know
whether
they
had
been
well
done
or
ill
at
least
he
had
done
his
best
and
must
depart
to
his
count
s
in
replying
to
their
various
remarks
i
could
feel
in
spite
of
myself
a
pleased
agreeable
faintly
smile
playing
over
my
countenance
as
well
as
could
remark
that
that
smile
communicated
itself
to
those
to
whom
i
was
speaking
so
here
was
i
without
a
tutor
yet
with
my
own
private
drozhki
my
name
printed
on
the
list
of
students
a
sword
and
belt
of
my
own
and
a
chance
of
an
occasional
salute
from
officials
in
short
i
was
grownup
and
i
suppose
happy
finally
we
arranged
to
go
out
and
dine
at
five
o
clock
but
since
woloda
presently
went
off
to
dubkoff
s
and
dimitri
disappeared
in
his
usual
fashion
saying
that
there
was
something
he
must
do
before
dinner
i
was
left
with
two
whole
hours
still
at
my
disposal
for
a
time
i
walked
through
the
rooms
of
the
house
and
looked
at
myself
in
all
the
mirrors
firstly
with
the
tunic
buttoned
then
with
it
unbuttoned
and
lastly
with
only
the
top
button
fastened
each
time
it
looked
splendid
eventually
though
anxious
not
to
show
any
excess
of
delight
i
found
myself
unable
to
refrain
from
crossing
over
to
the
and
stables
to
gaze
at
krassovchik
kuzma
and
the
drozhki
then
i
returned
and
once
more
began
my
tour
of
the
rooms
where
i
looked
at
myself
in
all
the
mirrors
as
before
and
counted
my
money
over
in
my
pocket
my
face
smiling
happily
the
while
yet
not
an
hour
had
elapsed
before
i
began
to
feel
slightly
ennuye
to
feel
a
shade
of
regret
that
no
one
was
present
to
see
me
in
my
splendid
position
i
began
to
long
for
life
and
movement
and
so
sent
out
orders
for
the
drozhki
to
be
got
ready
since
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
drive
to
the
kuznetski
bridge
and
make
some
purchases
in
this
connection
i
recalled
how
after
matriculating
woloda
had
gone
and
bought
himself
a
lithograph
of
horses
by
victor
adam
and
some
pipes
and
tobacco
wherefore
i
felt
that
i
too
must
do
the
same
amid
glances
showered
upon
me
from
every
side
and
with
the
sunlight
reflected
from
my
buttons
and
sword
i
drove
to
the
kuznetski
bridge
where
halting
at
a
picture
shop
i
entered
it
with
my
eyes
looking
to
every
side
it
was
not
precisely
horses
by
adam
which
i
meant
to
buy
since
i
did
not
wish
to
be
accused
of
too
closely
imitating
woloda
wherefore
out
of
shame
for
causing
the
obsequious
shopmen
such
agitation
as
i
appeared
to
do
i
made
a
hasty
selection
and
pitched
upon
a
of
a
woman
s
head
which
i
saw
displayed
in
the
window
price
twenty
roubles
yet
no
sooner
had
i
paid
the
twenty
roubles
over
the
counter
than
my
heart
smote
me
for
having
put
two
such
beautifully
dressed
to
so
much
trouble
for
such
a
trifle
moreover
i
fancied
that
they
were
regarding
me
with
some
disdain
accordingly
in
my
desire
to
show
them
what
manner
of
man
i
was
i
turned
my
attention
to
a
silver
trifle
which
i
saw
displayed
in
a
and
recognising
that
it
was
a
price
eighteen
roubles
requested
that
it
should
forthwith
be
wrapped
in
paper
for
me
next
the
money
paid
and
the
information
acquired
that
splendid
pipes
and
tobacco
were
to
be
obtained
in
an
adjacent
emporium
i
bowed
to
the
two
shopmen
politely
and
issued
into
the
street
with
the
picture
under
my
arm
at
the
shop
next
door
which
had
painted
on
its
a
negro
smoking
a
cigar
i
bought
likewise
out
of
a
desire
to
imitate
no
one
some
turkish
tobacco
a
stamboul
hookah
and
two
pipes
on
coming
out
of
the
shop
i
had
just
entered
the
drozhki
when
i
caught
sight
of
semenoff
who
was
walking
hurriedly
along
the
pavement
with
his
head
bent
down
vexed
that
he
should
not
have
recognised
me
i
called
out
to
him
pretty
loudly
hold
on
a
minute
and
whipping
up
the
drozhki
soon
overtook
him
how
do
you
do
i
said
my
respects
to
you
he
replied
but
without
stopping
why
are
you
not
in
your
university
uniform
i
next
inquired
at
this
he
stopped
short
with
a
frown
and
parted
his
white
teeth
as
though
the
sun
were
hurting
his
eyes
the
next
moment
however
he
threw
a
glance
of
studied
indifference
at
my
drozhki
and
uniform
and
continued
on
his
way
from
the
kuznetski
bridge
i
drove
to
a
confectioner
s
in
tverskaia
street
and
much
as
i
should
have
liked
it
to
be
supposed
that
it
was
the
newspapers
which
most
interested
me
i
had
no
choice
but
to
begin
falling
upon
tartlet
after
tartlet
in
fact
for
all
my
bashfulness
before
a
gentleman
who
kept
regarding
me
with
some
curiosity
from
behind
a
newspaper
i
ate
with
great
swiftness
a
tartlet
of
each
of
the
eight
different
sorts
which
the
confectioner
kept
on
reaching
home
i
experienced
a
slight
touch
of
but
paid
no
attention
to
it
and
set
to
work
to
inspect
my
purchases
of
these
the
picture
so
much
displeased
me
that
instead
of
having
it
framed
and
hung
in
my
room
as
woloda
had
done
with
his
i
took
pains
to
hide
it
behind
a
chest
of
drawers
where
no
one
could
see
it
likewise
though
i
also
found
the
distasteful
i
was
able
as
i
laid
it
on
my
table
to
comfort
myself
with
the
thought
that
it
was
at
least
a
silver
article
so
much
capital
as
it
were
and
likely
to
be
very
useful
to
a
student
as
for
the
smoking
things
i
decided
to
put
them
into
use
at
once
and
try
their
capabilities
unsealing
the
four
packages
and
carefully
filling
the
stamboul
pipe
with
some
turkish
tobacco
i
applied
a
hot
cinder
to
it
and
taking
the
mouthpiece
between
my
first
and
second
fingers
a
position
of
the
hand
which
greatly
caught
my
fancy
started
to
inhale
the
smoke
the
smell
of
the
tobacco
seemed
delightful
yet
something
burnt
my
mouth
and
caught
me
by
the
breath
nevertheless
i
hardened
my
heart
and
continued
to
draw
abundant
fumes
into
my
interior
then
i
tried
blowing
rings
and
retaining
the
smoke
soon
the
room
became
filled
with
blue
vapours
while
the
pipe
started
to
crackle
and
the
tobacco
to
fly
out
in
sparks
presently
also
i
began
to
feel
a
smarting
in
my
mouth
and
a
giddiness
in
my
head
accordingly
i
was
on
the
point
of
stopping
and
going
to
look
at
myself
and
my
pipe
in
the
mirror
when
to
my
surprise
i
found
myself
staggering
about
the
room
was
whirling
round
and
round
and
as
i
peered
into
the
mirror
which
i
reached
only
with
some
difficulty
i
perceived
that
my
face
was
as
white
as
a
sheet
hardly
had
i
thrown
myself
down
upon
a
sofa
when
such
nausea
and
faintness
swept
over
me
that
making
up
my
mind
that
the
pipe
had
proved
my
death
i
expected
every
moment
to
expire
terribly
frightened
i
tried
to
call
out
for
some
one
to
come
and
help
me
and
to
send
for
the
doctor
however
this
panic
of
mine
did
not
last
long
for
i
soon
understood
what
the
matter
with
me
was
and
remained
lying
on
the
sofa
with
a
racking
headache
and
my
limbs
relaxed
as
i
stared
dully
at
the
stamp
on
the
package
of
tobacco
the
coiled
on
the
floor
and
the
odds
and
ends
of
tobacco
and
confectioner
s
tartlets
which
were
littered
about
truly
i
thought
to
myself
in
my
dejection
and
disillusionment
i
can
not
be
quite
if
i
can
not
smoke
as
other
fellows
do
and
should
be
fated
never
to
hold
a
chibouk
between
my
first
and
second
fingers
or
to
inhale
and
puff
smoke
through
a
flaxen
moustache
when
dimitri
called
for
me
at
five
o
clock
he
found
me
in
this
unpleasant
predicament
after
drinking
a
glass
of
water
however
i
felt
nearly
recovered
and
ready
to
go
with
him
so
much
for
your
trying
to
smoke
said
he
as
he
gazed
at
the
remnants
of
my
debauch
it
is
a
silly
thing
to
do
and
waste
of
money
as
well
i
long
ago
promised
myself
never
to
smoke
but
come
along
we
have
to
call
for
xiv
how
woloda
and
dubkoff
amused
themselves
the
moment
that
dimitri
entered
my
room
i
perceived
from
his
face
manner
of
walking
and
the
signs
which
in
him
denoted
a
blinking
of
the
eyes
and
a
grim
holding
of
his
head
to
one
side
as
though
to
straighten
his
collar
that
he
was
in
the
frame
of
mind
which
was
his
when
he
felt
dissatisfied
with
himself
it
was
a
frame
of
mind
too
which
always
produced
a
chilling
effect
upon
my
feelings
towards
him
of
late
i
had
begun
to
observe
and
appraise
my
friend
s
character
a
little
more
but
our
friendship
had
in
no
way
suffered
from
that
since
it
was
still
too
young
and
strong
for
me
to
be
able
to
look
upon
dimitri
as
anything
but
perfect
no
matter
in
what
light
i
regarded
him
in
him
there
were
two
personalities
both
of
which
i
thought
beautiful
one
which
i
loved
devotedly
was
kind
mild
forgiving
gay
and
conscious
of
being
those
various
things
when
he
was
in
this
frame
of
mind
his
whole
exterior
the
very
tone
of
his
voice
his
every
movement
appeared
to
say
i
am
kind
and
and
rejoice
in
being
so
and
every
one
can
see
that
i
so
the
other
of
his
two
personalities
one
which
i
had
only
just
begun
to
apprehend
and
before
the
majesty
of
which
i
bowed
in
spirit
was
that
of
a
man
who
was
cold
stern
to
himself
and
to
others
proud
religious
to
the
point
of
fanaticism
and
pedantically
moral
at
the
present
moment
he
was
as
i
say
this
second
personality
with
that
frankness
which
constituted
a
necessary
condition
of
our
relations
i
told
him
as
soon
as
we
entered
the
drozhki
how
much
it
depressed
and
hurt
me
to
see
him
on
this
my
in
a
frame
of
mind
so
irksome
and
disagreeable
to
me
what
has
upset
you
so
i
asked
him
will
you
not
tell
me
my
dear
nicolas
was
his
slow
reply
as
he
gave
his
head
a
nervous
twitch
to
one
side
and
blinked
his
eyes
since
i
have
given
you
my
word
never
to
conceal
anything
from
you
you
have
no
reason
to
suspect
me
of
secretiveness
one
can
not
always
be
in
exactly
the
same
mood
and
if
i
seem
at
all
put
out
that
is
all
there
is
to
say
about
what
a
marvellously
open
honourable
character
his
is
i
thought
to
myself
and
dropped
the
subject
we
drove
the
rest
of
the
way
to
dubkoff
s
in
silence
dubkoff
s
flat
was
an
unusually
fine
one
or
at
all
events
so
it
seemed
to
me
everywhere
were
rugs
pictures
gardenias
striped
hangings
photographs
and
curved
settees
while
on
the
walls
hung
guns
pistols
pouches
and
the
mounted
heads
of
wild
beasts
it
was
the
appearance
of
this
apartment
which
made
me
aware
whom
it
was
that
woloda
had
imitated
in
the
scheme
of
his
own
we
found
dubkoff
and
woloda
engaged
in
cards
while
seated
also
at
the
table
and
watching
the
game
with
close
attention
was
a
gentleman
whom
i
did
not
know
but
who
appeared
to
be
of
no
great
importance
judging
by
the
modesty
of
his
attitude
dubkoff
himself
was
in
a
silk
and
soft
slippers
while
woloda
seated
opposite
him
on
a
divan
was
in
his
shirtsleeves
as
well
as
to
judge
by
his
flushed
face
and
the
impatient
cursory
glance
which
he
gave
us
for
a
second
as
he
looked
up
from
the
cards
much
taken
up
with
the
game
on
seeing
me
he
reddened
still
more
well
it
is
for
you
to
deal
he
remarked
to
dubkoff
in
an
instant
i
divined
that
he
did
not
altogether
relish
my
becoming
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
he
gambled
yet
his
expression
had
nothing
in
it
of
confusion
only
a
look
which
seemed
to
me
to
say
yes
i
play
cards
and
if
you
are
surprised
at
that
it
is
only
because
you
are
so
young
there
is
nothing
wrong
about
it
it
is
a
necessity
at
our
yes
i
at
once
divined
and
understood
that
instead
of
dealing
however
dubkoff
rose
and
shook
hands
with
us
after
which
he
bade
us
both
be
seated
and
then
offered
us
pipes
which
we
declined
here
is
our
diplomat
then
the
hero
of
the
day
he
said
to
me
good
lord
how
you
look
like
a
colonel
i
muttered
in
reply
though
once
more
feeling
a
complacent
smile
overspread
my
countenance
i
stood
in
that
awe
of
dubkoff
which
a
boy
naturally
feels
for
a
man
of
whom
his
elders
say
that
he
is
a
very
clever
young
man
who
can
dance
well
and
speak
french
and
who
though
secretly
despising
one
s
youth
endeavours
to
conceal
the
fact
yet
despite
my
respect
for
him
i
somehow
found
it
difficult
and
uncomfortable
throughout
my
acquaintanceship
with
him
to
look
him
in
the
eyes
i
have
since
remarked
that
there
are
three
kinds
of
men
whom
i
can
not
face
easily
namely
those
who
are
much
better
than
myself
those
who
are
much
worse
and
those
between
whom
and
myself
there
is
a
mutual
determination
not
to
mention
some
particular
thing
of
which
we
are
both
aware
dubkoff
may
have
been
a
much
better
fellow
than
myself
or
he
may
have
been
a
much
worse
but
the
point
was
that
he
lied
very
frequently
without
recognising
the
fact
that
i
was
aware
of
his
doing
so
yet
had
determined
not
to
mention
it
let
us
play
another
round
said
woloda
hunching
one
shoulder
after
the
manner
of
papa
and
reshuffling
the
cards
how
persistent
you
are
said
dubkoff
we
can
play
all
we
want
to
afterwards
well
one
more
round
during
the
play
i
looked
at
their
hands
woloda
s
hands
were
large
and
red
whilst
in
the
crook
of
the
thumb
and
the
way
in
which
the
other
fingers
curved
themselves
round
the
cards
as
he
held
them
they
so
exactly
resembled
papa
s
that
now
and
then
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
woloda
purposely
held
the
cards
thus
so
as
to
look
the
more
like
a
grownup
yet
the
next
moment
looking
at
his
face
i
could
see
that
he
had
not
a
thought
in
his
mind
beyond
the
game
dubkoff
s
hands
on
the
contrary
were
small
puffy
and
inclined
to
clench
themselves
as
well
as
extremely
neat
and
they
were
just
the
kind
of
hands
which
generally
display
rings
and
which
are
most
to
be
seen
on
persons
who
are
both
inclined
to
use
them
and
fond
of
objets
de
vertu
woloda
must
have
lost
for
the
gentleman
who
was
watching
the
play
remarked
that
vladimir
petrovitch
had
terribly
bad
luck
while
dubkoff
reached
for
a
note
book
wrote
something
in
it
and
then
showing
woloda
what
he
had
written
said
is
that
right
said
woloda
glancing
with
feigned
carelessness
at
the
note
book
now
let
us
woloda
took
dubkoff
and
i
gave
dimitri
a
lift
in
my
drozhki
what
were
they
playing
at
i
inquired
of
dimitri
at
piquet
it
is
a
stupid
game
in
fact
all
such
games
are
and
were
they
playing
for
much
no
not
very
much
but
more
than
they
ought
do
you
ever
play
yourself
no
i
swore
never
to
do
so
but
dubkoff
will
play
with
any
one
he
can
get
hold
he
ought
not
to
do
that
i
remarked
so
woloda
does
not
play
so
well
as
he
does
perhaps
dubkoff
ought
not
to
as
you
say
yet
there
is
nothing
especially
bad
about
it
all
he
likes
playing
and
plays
well
but
he
is
a
good
fellow
all
the
i
had
no
idea
of
this
i
said
we
must
not
think
ill
of
him
concluded
dimitri
since
he
is
a
simply
splendid
fellow
i
like
him
very
much
and
always
shall
like
him
in
spite
of
his
for
some
reason
or
another
the
idea
occurred
to
me
that
just
because
dimitri
stuck
up
so
stoutly
for
dubkoff
he
neither
liked
nor
respected
him
in
reality
but
was
determined
out
of
stubbornness
and
a
desire
not
to
be
accused
of
inconstancy
never
to
own
to
the
fact
he
was
one
of
those
people
who
love
their
friends
their
life
long
not
so
much
because
those
friends
remain
always
dear
to
them
as
because
having
once
possibly
mistakenly
liked
a
person
they
look
upon
it
as
dishonourable
to
cease
ever
to
do
so
xv
i
am
feted
at
dinner
dubkoff
and
woloda
knew
every
one
at
the
restaurant
by
name
and
every
one
from
the
waiters
to
the
proprietor
paid
them
great
respect
no
time
was
lost
in
allotting
us
a
private
room
where
a
bottle
of
iced
which
i
tried
to
look
with
as
much
indifference
as
i
could
stood
ready
waiting
for
us
and
where
we
were
served
with
a
most
wonderful
repast
selected
by
dubkoff
from
the
french
menu
the
meal
went
off
most
gaily
and
agreeably
notwithstanding
that
dubkoff
as
usual
told
us
tales
of
doubtful
veracity
among
others
a
tale
of
how
his
grandmother
once
shot
dead
three
robbers
who
were
attacking
her
a
recital
at
which
i
blushed
closed
my
eyes
and
turned
away
from
the
narrator
and
that
woloda
reddened
visibly
whenever
i
opened
my
mouth
to
speak
which
was
the
more
uncalled
for
on
his
part
seeing
that
never
once
so
far
as
i
can
remember
did
i
say
anything
shameful
after
we
had
been
given
champagne
every
one
congratulated
me
and
i
drank
hands
across
with
dimitri
and
dubkoff
and
wished
them
joy
since
however
i
did
not
know
to
whom
the
bottle
of
champagne
belonged
it
was
explained
to
me
later
that
it
was
common
property
i
considered
that
in
return
i
ought
to
treat
my
friends
out
of
the
money
which
i
had
never
ceased
to
finger
in
my
pocket
accordingly
i
stealthily
extracted
a
note
and
beckoning
the
waiter
to
my
side
handed
him
the
money
and
told
him
in
a
whisper
yet
not
so
softly
but
that
every
one
could
hear
me
seeing
that
every
one
was
staring
at
me
in
dead
silence
to
bring
if
you
please
a
of
at
this
woloda
reddened
again
and
began
to
fidget
so
violently
and
to
gaze
upon
myself
and
every
one
else
with
such
a
distracted
air
that
i
felt
sure
i
had
somehow
put
my
foot
in
it
however
the
came
and
we
drank
it
with
great
gusto
after
that
things
went
on
merrily
dubkoff
continued
his
unending
fairy
tales
while
woloda
also
told
funny
stories
and
told
them
well
too
in
a
way
i
should
never
have
credited
him
so
that
our
laughter
rang
long
and
loud
their
best
efforts
lay
in
imitation
and
in
variants
of
a
certain
saw
have
you
ever
been
abroad
one
would
say
to
the
other
for
instance
no
the
one
interrogated
would
reply
but
my
brother
plays
the
such
perfection
had
the
pair
attained
in
this
species
of
comic
absurdity
that
they
could
answer
any
question
by
its
means
while
they
would
also
endeavour
to
unite
two
absolutely
unconnected
matters
without
a
previous
question
having
been
asked
at
all
yet
say
everything
with
a
perfectly
serious
face
and
produce
a
most
comic
effect
i
too
began
to
try
to
be
funny
but
as
soon
as
ever
i
spoke
they
either
looked
at
me
askance
or
did
not
look
at
me
until
i
had
finished
so
that
my
anecdotes
fell
flat
yet
though
dubkoff
always
remarked
our
diplomat
is
lying
brother
i
felt
so
exhilarated
with
the
champagne
and
the
company
of
my
elders
that
the
remark
scarcely
touched
me
only
dimitri
though
he
drank
level
with
the
rest
of
us
continued
in
the
same
severe
serious
frame
of
mind
a
fact
which
put
a
certain
check
upon
the
general
hilarity
now
look
here
gentlemen
said
dubkoff
at
last
after
dinner
we
ought
to
take
the
diplomat
in
hand
how
would
it
be
for
him
to
go
with
us
to
see
auntie
there
we
could
put
him
through
his
ah
but
nechludoff
will
not
go
there
objected
woloda
o
unbearable
insupportable
man
of
quiet
habits
that
you
are
cried
dubkoff
turning
to
dimitri
yet
come
with
us
and
you
shall
see
what
an
excellent
lady
my
dear
auntie
i
will
neither
go
myself
nor
let
him
go
replied
dimitri
let
whom
go
the
diplomat
why
you
yourself
saw
how
he
brightened
up
at
the
very
mention
of
it
is
not
so
much
that
i
will
not
let
him
go
continued
dimitri
rising
and
beginning
to
pace
the
room
without
looking
at
me
as
that
i
neither
wish
him
nor
advise
him
to
go
he
is
not
a
child
now
and
if
he
must
go
he
can
go
alone
without
you
surely
you
are
ashamed
of
this
dubkoff
ashamed
of
always
wanting
others
to
do
all
the
wrong
things
that
you
yourself
do
but
what
is
there
so
very
wrong
in
my
inviting
you
all
to
come
and
take
a
cup
of
tea
with
my
aunt
said
dubkoff
with
a
wink
at
woloda
if
you
don
t
like
us
going
it
is
your
affair
yet
we
are
going
all
the
same
are
you
coming
woloda
yes
yes
assented
woloda
we
can
go
there
and
then
return
to
my
rooms
and
continue
our
do
you
want
to
go
with
them
or
not
said
dimitri
approaching
me
no
i
replied
at
the
same
time
making
room
for
him
to
sit
down
beside
me
on
the
divan
i
did
not
wish
to
go
in
any
case
and
since
you
advise
me
not
to
nothing
on
earth
will
make
me
go
now
yet
i
added
a
moment
later
i
can
not
honestly
say
that
i
have
no
desire
to
go
all
i
say
is
that
i
am
glad
i
am
not
that
is
right
he
said
live
your
own
life
and
do
not
dance
to
any
one
s
piping
that
is
the
better
this
little
tiff
not
only
failed
to
mar
our
hilarity
but
even
increased
it
dimitri
suddenly
reverted
to
the
kindly
mood
which
i
loved
best
so
great
as
i
afterwards
remarked
on
more
than
one
occasion
was
the
influence
which
the
consciousness
of
having
done
a
good
deed
exercised
upon
him
at
the
present
moment
the
source
of
his
satisfaction
was
the
fact
that
he
had
stopped
my
expedition
to
auntie
he
grew
extraordinarily
gay
called
for
another
bottle
of
champagne
which
was
against
his
rules
invited
some
one
who
was
a
perfect
stranger
into
our
room
plied
him
with
wine
sang
gaudeamus
igitur
requested
every
one
to
join
him
in
the
chorus
and
proposed
that
we
should
and
rink
at
the
sokolniki
mews
let
us
enjoy
ourselves
he
said
with
a
laugh
it
is
in
honour
of
his
matriculation
that
you
now
see
me
getting
drunk
for
the
first
time
in
my
yet
somehow
this
merriment
sat
ill
upon
him
he
was
like
some
father
or
tutor
who
is
pleased
with
his
young
charges
and
lets
himself
go
for
their
amusement
yet
at
the
same
time
tries
to
show
them
that
one
can
enjoy
oneself
decently
and
in
an
honourable
manner
however
his
unexpected
gaiety
had
an
infectious
influence
upon
myself
and
my
companions
and
the
more
so
because
each
of
us
had
now
drunk
about
half
a
bottle
of
champagne
it
was
in
this
pleasing
frame
of
mind
that
i
went
out
into
the
main
salon
to
smoke
a
cigarette
which
dubkoff
had
given
me
in
rising
i
noticed
that
my
head
seemed
to
swim
a
little
and
that
my
legs
and
arms
retained
their
natural
positions
only
when
i
bent
my
thoughts
determinedly
upon
them
at
other
moments
my
legs
would
deviate
from
the
straight
line
and
my
arms
describe
strange
gestures
i
concentrated
my
whole
attention
upon
the
members
in
question
forced
my
hands
first
to
raise
themselves
and
button
my
tunic
and
then
to
smooth
my
hair
though
they
ruffled
my
locks
in
doing
so
and
lastly
commanded
my
legs
to
march
me
to
the
door
a
function
which
they
duly
performed
though
at
one
time
with
too
much
reluctance
and
at
another
with
too
much
abandon
the
left
leg
in
particular
coming
to
a
halt
every
moment
on
tiptoe
some
one
called
out
to
me
where
are
you
going
to
they
will
bring
you
a
directly
but
i
guessed
the
voice
to
be
woloda
s
and
feeling
satisfied
somehow
that
i
had
succeeded
in
divining
the
fact
merely
smiled
airily
in
reply
and
continued
on
my
way
xvi
the
quarrel
in
the
main
salon
i
perceived
sitting
at
a
small
table
a
short
squat
gentleman
of
the
professional
type
he
had
a
red
moustache
and
was
engaged
in
eating
something
or
another
while
by
his
side
sat
a
tall
individual
with
whom
he
was
carrying
on
a
conversation
in
french
somehow
the
aspect
of
these
two
persons
displeased
me
yet
i
decided
for
all
that
to
light
my
cigarette
at
the
candelabrum
which
was
standing
before
them
looking
from
side
to
side
to
avoid
meeting
their
gaze
i
approached
the
table
and
applied
my
cigarette
to
the
flame
when
it
was
fairly
alight
i
involuntarily
threw
a
glance
at
the
gentleman
who
was
eating
and
found
his
grey
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
an
expression
of
intense
displeasure
just
as
i
was
turning
away
his
red
moustache
moved
a
little
and
he
said
in
french
i
do
not
like
people
to
smoke
when
i
am
dining
my
good
i
murmured
something
inaudible
no
i
do
not
like
it
at
all
he
went
on
sternly
and
with
a
glance
at
his
companion
as
though
inviting
him
to
admire
the
way
in
which
he
was
about
to
deal
with
me
i
do
not
like
it
my
good
sir
nor
do
i
like
people
who
have
the
impudence
to
puff
their
smoke
up
one
s
very
by
this
time
i
had
gathered
that
it
was
myself
he
was
scolding
and
at
first
felt
as
though
i
had
been
altogether
in
the
wrong
i
did
not
mean
to
inconvenience
you
i
said
well
if
you
did
not
suppose
you
were
being
impertinent
at
least
i
did
you
are
a
cad
young
sir
he
shouted
in
reply
but
what
right
have
you
to
shout
at
me
like
that
i
exclaimed
feeling
that
it
was
now
he
that
was
insulting
me
and
growing
angry
accordingly
this
much
right
he
replied
that
i
never
allow
myself
to
be
overlooked
by
any
one
and
that
i
always
teach
young
fellows
like
yourself
their
manners
what
is
your
name
young
sir
and
where
do
you
live
at
this
i
felt
so
hurt
that
my
teeth
chattered
and
i
felt
as
though
i
were
choking
yet
all
the
while
i
was
conscious
of
being
in
the
wrong
and
so
instead
of
offering
any
further
rudeness
to
the
offended
one
humbly
told
him
my
name
and
address
and
my
name
young
sir
he
returned
is
kolpikoff
and
i
will
trouble
you
to
be
more
polite
to
me
in
however
you
will
hear
from
me
again
vous
aurez
de
mes
nouvelles
the
conversation
had
been
carried
on
wholly
in
french
was
his
concluding
remark
to
this
i
replied
i
shall
be
delighted
with
an
infusion
of
as
much
hauteur
as
i
could
muster
into
my
tone
then
turning
on
my
heel
i
returned
with
my
cigarette
which
had
meanwhile
gone
out
to
our
own
room
i
said
nothing
either
to
my
brother
or
my
friends
about
what
had
happened
and
the
more
so
because
they
were
at
that
moment
engaged
in
a
dispute
of
their
own
but
sat
down
in
a
corner
to
think
over
the
strange
affair
the
words
you
are
a
cad
young
sir
vexed
me
more
and
more
the
longer
that
they
sounded
in
my
ears
my
tipsiness
was
gone
now
and
in
considering
my
conduct
during
the
dispute
the
uncomfortable
thought
came
over
me
that
i
had
behaved
like
a
coward
yet
what
right
had
he
to
attack
me
i
reflected
why
did
he
not
simply
intimate
to
me
that
i
was
annoying
him
after
all
it
may
have
been
he
that
was
in
the
wrong
why
too
when
he
called
me
a
young
cad
did
i
not
say
to
him
a
cad
my
good
sir
is
one
who
takes
offence
or
why
did
i
not
simply
tell
him
to
hold
his
tongue
that
would
have
been
the
better
course
or
why
did
i
not
challenge
him
to
a
duel
no
i
did
none
of
those
things
but
swallowed
his
insults
like
a
wretched
still
the
words
you
are
a
cad
young
sir
kept
sounding
in
my
ears
with
maddening
iteration
i
can
not
leave
things
as
they
are
i
at
length
decided
as
i
rose
to
my
feet
with
the
fixed
intention
of
returning
to
the
gentleman
and
saying
something
outrageous
to
him
perhaps
also
of
breaking
the
candelabrum
over
his
head
if
occasion
offered
yet
though
i
considered
the
advisability
of
this
last
measure
with
some
pleasure
it
was
not
without
a
good
deal
of
trepidation
that
i
the
main
salon
as
luck
would
have
it
kolpikoff
was
no
longer
there
but
only
a
waiter
engaged
in
clearing
the
table
for
a
moment
i
felt
like
telling
the
waiter
the
whole
story
and
explaining
to
him
my
innocence
in
the
matter
but
for
some
reason
or
another
i
thought
better
of
it
and
once
more
returned
in
the
same
hazy
condition
of
mind
to
our
own
room
what
has
become
of
our
diplomat
dubkoff
was
just
saying
upon
him
now
hang
the
fortunes
of
oh
leave
me
alone
i
said
turning
moodily
away
then
as
i
paced
the
room
something
made
me
begin
to
think
that
dubkoff
was
not
altogether
a
good
fellow
there
is
nothing
very
much
to
admire
in
his
eternal
jokes
and
his
nickname
of
diplomat
i
reflected
all
he
thinks
about
is
to
win
money
from
woloda
and
to
go
and
see
his
there
is
nothing
very
nice
in
all
that
besides
everything
he
says
has
a
touch
of
blackguardism
in
it
and
he
is
forever
trying
to
make
people
laugh
in
my
opinion
he
is
simply
stupid
when
he
is
not
absolutely
a
i
spent
about
five
minutes
in
these
reflections
and
felt
my
enmity
towards
dubkoff
continually
increasing
for
his
part
he
took
no
notice
of
me
and
that
angered
me
the
more
i
actually
felt
vexed
with
woloda
and
dimitri
because
they
went
on
talking
to
him
i
tell
you
what
gentlemen
the
diplomat
ought
to
be
christened
said
dubkoff
suddenly
with
a
glance
and
a
smile
which
seemed
to
me
derisive
and
even
treacherous
yet
o
lord
what
a
poor
specimen
he
is
you
yourself
ought
to
be
christened
and
you
yourself
are
a
sorry
specimen
i
retorted
with
an
evil
smile
and
actually
forgetting
to
address
him
as
in
russian
as
in
french
the
second
person
singular
is
the
form
of
speech
used
between
intimate
friends
this
reply
evidently
surprised
dubkoff
but
he
turned
away
and
went
on
talking
to
woloda
and
dimitri
i
tried
to
edge
myself
into
the
conversation
but
since
i
felt
that
i
could
not
keep
it
up
i
soon
returned
to
my
corner
and
remained
there
until
we
left
when
the
bill
had
been
paid
and
wraps
were
being
put
on
dubkoff
turned
to
dimitri
and
said
whither
are
orestes
and
pedalion
going
now
home
i
suppose
to
talk
about
love
well
let
us
go
and
see
my
dear
auntie
that
will
be
far
more
entertaining
than
your
sour
how
dare
you
speak
like
that
and
laugh
at
us
i
burst
out
as
i
approached
him
with
clenched
fists
how
dare
you
laugh
at
feelings
which
you
do
not
understand
i
will
not
have
you
do
it
hold
your
tongue
at
this
point
i
had
to
hold
my
own
for
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
next
and
was
moreover
out
of
breath
with
excitement
at
first
dubkoff
was
taken
aback
but
presently
he
tried
to
laugh
it
off
and
to
take
it
as
a
joke
finally
i
was
surprised
to
see
him
look
crestfallen
and
lower
his
eyes
i
never
laugh
at
you
or
your
feelings
it
is
merely
my
way
of
speaking
he
said
evasively
indeed
i
cried
yet
the
next
moment
i
felt
ashamed
of
myself
and
sorry
for
him
since
his
flushed
downcast
face
had
in
it
no
other
expression
than
one
of
genuine
pain
what
is
the
matter
with
you
said
woloda
and
dimitri
simultaneously
no
one
was
trying
to
insult
yes
he
did
try
to
insult
me
i
replied
what
an
extraordinary
fellow
your
brother
is
said
dubkoff
to
woloda
at
that
moment
he
was
passing
out
of
the
door
and
could
not
have
heard
what
i
said
possibly
i
should
have
flung
myself
after
him
and
offered
him
further
insult
had
it
not
been
that
just
at
that
moment
the
waiter
who
had
witnessed
my
encounter
with
kolpikoff
handed
me
my
greatcoat
and
i
at
once
quietened
down
merely
making
such
a
pretence
of
having
had
a
difference
with
dimitri
as
was
necessary
to
make
my
sudden
appeasement
appear
nothing
extraordinary
next
day
when
i
met
dubkoff
at
woloda
s
the
quarrel
was
not
raked
up
yet
he
and
i
still
addressed
each
other
as
you
and
found
it
harder
than
ever
to
look
one
another
in
the
face
the
remembrance
of
my
scene
with
kolpikoff
who
by
the
way
never
sent
me
de
ses
nouvelles
either
the
following
day
or
any
day
afterwards
remained
for
years
a
keen
and
unpleasant
memory
even
so
much
as
five
years
after
it
had
happened
i
would
begin
fidgeting
and
muttering
to
myself
whenever
i
remembered
the
unavenged
insult
and
was
fain
to
comfort
myself
with
the
satisfaction
of
recollecting
the
sort
of
young
fellow
i
had
shown
myself
to
be
in
my
subsequent
affair
with
dubkoff
in
fact
it
was
only
later
still
that
i
began
to
regard
the
matter
in
another
light
and
both
to
recall
with
comic
appreciation
my
passage
of
arms
with
kolpikoff
and
to
regret
the
undeserved
affront
which
i
had
offered
my
good
friend
dubkoff
when
at
a
later
hour
on
the
evening
of
the
dinner
i
told
dimitri
of
my
affair
with
kolpikoff
whose
exterior
i
described
in
detail
he
was
astounded
that
is
the
very
man
he
cried
don
t
you
know
that
this
precious
kolpikoff
is
a
known
scamp
and
sharper
as
well
as
above
all
things
a
coward
and
that
he
was
expelled
from
his
regiment
by
his
brother
officers
because
having
had
his
face
slapped
he
would
not
fight
but
how
came
you
to
let
him
get
away
he
added
with
a
kindly
smile
and
glance
surely
he
could
not
have
said
more
to
you
than
he
did
when
he
called
you
a
cad
no
i
admitted
with
a
blush
well
it
was
not
right
but
there
is
no
great
harm
done
said
dimitri
consolingly
long
afterwards
when
thinking
the
matter
over
at
leisure
i
suddenly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
quite
possible
that
kolpikoff
took
the
opportunity
of
vicariously
wiping
off
upon
me
the
slap
in
the
face
which
he
had
once
received
just
as
i
myself
took
the
opportunity
of
vicariously
wiping
off
upon
the
innocent
dubkoff
the
epithet
cad
which
kolpikoff
had
just
applied
to
me
xvii
i
get
ready
to
pay
some
calls
on
awaking
next
morning
my
first
thoughts
were
of
the
affair
with
kolpikoff
once
again
i
muttered
to
myself
and
stamped
about
the
room
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
was
the
last
day
that
i
was
to
spend
in
moscow
and
it
was
to
be
spent
by
papa
s
orders
in
my
paying
a
round
of
calls
which
he
had
written
out
for
me
on
a
piece
of
paper
his
first
solicitude
on
our
account
being
not
so
much
for
our
morals
or
our
education
as
for
our
due
observance
of
the
convenances
on
the
piece
of
paper
was
written
in
his
swift
broken
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
without
fail
the
iwins
without
fail
prince
michael
the
princess
nechludoff
and
madame
valakhina
if
you
of
course
i
was
also
to
call
upon
my
guardian
upon
the
rector
and
upon
the
professors
these
calls
however
dimitri
advised
me
not
to
pay
saying
that
it
was
not
only
unnecessary
to
do
so
but
not
the
thing
however
there
were
the
other
visits
to
be
got
through
it
was
the
first
two
on
the
list
those
marked
as
to
be
paid
without
fail
that
most
alarmed
me
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
was
a
as
well
as
old
wealthy
and
a
bachelor
consequently
i
foresaw
that
conversation
between
him
and
myself
myself
a
student
was
not
likely
to
be
interesting
as
for
the
iwins
they
too
were
rich
the
father
being
a
departmental
official
of
high
rank
who
had
only
on
one
occasion
called
at
our
house
during
my
grandmother
s
time
since
her
death
i
had
remarked
that
the
younger
iwin
had
fought
shy
of
us
and
seemed
to
give
himself
airs
the
elder
of
the
pair
i
had
heard
had
now
finished
his
course
in
jurisprudence
and
gone
to
hold
a
post
in
petersburg
while
his
brother
sergius
the
former
object
of
my
worship
was
also
in
petersburg
as
a
great
fat
cadet
in
the
corps
of
pages
when
i
was
a
young
man
not
only
did
i
dislike
intercourse
with
people
who
thought
themselves
above
me
but
such
intercourse
was
for
me
an
unbearable
torture
owing
partly
to
my
constant
dread
of
being
snubbed
and
partly
to
my
straining
every
faculty
of
my
intellect
to
prove
to
such
people
my
independence
yet
even
if
i
failed
to
fulfil
the
latter
part
of
my
father
s
instructions
i
felt
that
i
must
carry
out
the
former
i
paced
my
room
and
eyed
my
clothes
ready
disposed
on
chairs
the
tunic
the
sword
and
the
cap
just
as
i
was
about
to
set
forth
old
grap
called
to
congratulate
me
bringing
with
him
ilinka
grap
pere
was
a
russianised
german
and
an
intolerably
effusive
sycophantic
old
man
who
was
more
often
than
not
tipsy
as
a
rule
he
visited
us
only
when
he
wanted
to
ask
for
something
and
although
papa
sometimes
entertained
him
in
his
study
old
grap
never
came
to
dinner
with
us
with
his
subserviency
and
begging
propensities
went
such
a
faculty
of
and
a
power
of
making
himself
at
home
that
every
one
looked
upon
his
attachment
to
us
as
a
great
honour
for
my
part
however
i
never
liked
him
and
felt
ashamed
when
he
was
speaking
i
was
much
put
out
by
the
arrival
of
these
visitors
and
made
no
effort
to
conceal
the
fact
upon
ilinka
i
had
been
so
used
to
look
down
and
he
so
used
to
recognise
my
right
to
do
so
that
it
displeased
me
to
think
that
he
was
now
as
much
a
matriculated
student
as
myself
in
some
way
he
appeared
to
me
to
have
made
a
point
of
attaining
that
equality
i
greeted
the
pair
coldly
and
without
offering
them
any
refreshment
since
it
went
against
the
grain
to
do
so
and
i
thought
they
could
ask
for
anything
if
they
wanted
it
without
my
first
inviting
them
to
state
their
requirements
gave
orders
for
the
drozhki
to
be
got
ready
ilinka
was
a
extremely
moral
and
far
from
stupid
young
fellow
yet
for
all
that
what
people
call
a
person
of
moods
that
is
to
say
for
no
apparent
reason
he
was
for
ever
in
some
pronounced
frame
of
mind
now
lachrymose
now
frivolous
now
touchy
on
the
very
smallest
point
at
the
present
moment
he
appeared
to
be
in
the
mood
he
kept
looking
from
his
father
to
myself
without
speaking
except
when
directly
addressed
at
which
times
he
smiled
the
forced
smile
under
which
he
was
accustomed
to
conceal
his
feelings
and
more
especially
that
feeling
of
shame
for
his
father
which
he
must
have
experienced
in
our
house
so
nicolas
petrovitch
the
old
man
said
to
me
following
me
everywhere
about
the
room
as
i
went
through
the
operation
of
dressing
while
all
the
while
his
fat
fingers
kept
turning
over
and
over
a
silver
with
which
my
grandmother
had
once
presented
me
as
soon
as
ever
i
heard
from
my
son
that
you
had
passed
your
examinations
so
well
though
of
course
your
abilities
are
to
everyone
i
at
once
came
to
congratulate
you
my
dear
boy
why
i
have
carried
you
on
my
shoulders
before
now
and
god
knows
that
i
love
you
as
though
you
were
my
own
son
my
ilinka
too
has
always
been
fond
of
you
and
feels
quite
at
home
with
meanwhile
the
said
ilinka
remained
sitting
silently
by
the
window
apparently
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
my
cap
and
every
now
and
then
angrily
muttering
something
in
an
undertone
now
i
also
wanted
to
ask
you
nicolas
his
father
went
on
whether
my
son
did
well
in
the
examinations
he
tells
me
that
he
is
going
to
be
in
the
same
faculty
as
yourself
and
that
therefore
you
will
be
able
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
and
advise
him
and
so
oh
yes
i
suppose
he
passed
well
i
replied
with
a
glance
at
ilinka
who
conscious
of
my
gaze
reddened
violently
and
ceased
to
move
his
lips
about
and
might
he
spend
the
day
with
you
was
the
father
s
next
request
which
he
made
with
a
deprecatory
smile
as
though
he
stood
in
actual
awe
of
me
yet
always
keeping
so
close
to
me
wherever
i
moved
that
the
fumes
of
the
drink
and
tobacco
in
which
he
had
been
indulging
were
constantly
perceptible
to
my
nostrils
i
felt
greatly
vexed
at
his
placing
me
in
such
a
false
position
towards
his
son
as
well
as
at
his
distracting
my
attention
from
what
was
to
me
a
highly
important
operation
namely
the
operation
of
dressing
while
over
and
above
all
i
was
annoyed
by
the
smell
of
liquor
with
which
he
followed
me
about
accordingly
i
said
very
coldly
that
i
could
not
have
the
pleasure
of
ilinka
s
company
that
day
since
i
should
be
out
ah
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
see
your
sister
put
in
ilinka
with
a
smile
but
without
looking
at
me
well
i
too
have
business
to
attend
at
this
i
felt
even
more
put
out
as
well
as
pricked
with
compunction
so
to
soften
my
refusal
a
little
i
hastened
to
say
that
the
reason
why
i
should
not
be
at
home
that
day
was
that
i
had
to
call
upon
the
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
the
princess
kornakoff
and
the
monsieur
iwin
who
held
such
an
influential
post
as
well
as
probably
to
dine
with
the
princess
nechludoff
for
i
thought
that
on
learning
what
important
folk
i
was
in
the
habit
of
mixing
with
the
graps
would
no
longer
think
it
worth
while
to
pretend
to
me
however
just
as
they
were
leaving
i
invited
ilinka
to
come
and
see
me
another
day
but
he
only
murmured
something
unintelligible
and
it
was
plain
that
he
meant
never
to
set
foot
in
the
house
again
when
they
had
departed
i
set
off
on
my
round
of
calls
woloda
whom
i
had
asked
that
morning
to
come
with
me
in
order
that
i
might
not
feel
quite
so
shy
as
when
altogether
alone
had
declined
on
the
ground
that
for
two
brothers
to
be
seen
driving
in
one
drozhki
would
appear
so
horribly
xviii
the
valakhin
family
accordingly
i
set
off
alone
my
first
call
on
the
route
lay
at
the
valakhin
mansion
it
was
now
three
years
since
i
had
seen
sonetchka
and
my
love
for
her
had
long
become
a
thing
of
the
past
yet
there
still
lingered
in
my
heart
a
sort
of
clear
touching
recollection
of
our
bygone
childish
affection
at
intervals
also
during
those
three
years
i
had
found
myself
recalling
her
memory
with
such
force
and
vividness
that
i
had
actually
shed
tears
and
imagined
myself
to
be
in
love
with
her
again
but
those
occasions
had
not
lasted
more
than
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
and
had
been
long
in
recurring
i
knew
that
sonetchka
and
her
mother
had
been
abroad
that
in
fact
they
had
been
so
for
the
last
two
years
also
i
had
heard
that
they
had
been
in
a
carriage
accident
and
that
sonetchka
s
face
had
been
so
badly
cut
with
the
broken
glass
that
her
beauty
was
marred
as
i
drove
to
their
house
i
kept
recalling
the
old
sonetchka
to
my
mind
and
wondering
what
she
would
look
like
when
i
met
her
somehow
i
imagined
that
after
her
two
years
sojourn
abroad
she
would
look
very
tall
with
a
beautiful
waist
and
though
sedate
and
imposing
extremely
attractive
somehow
also
my
imagination
refused
to
picture
her
with
her
face
disfigured
with
scars
but
on
the
contrary
since
i
had
read
somewhere
of
a
lover
who
remained
true
to
his
adored
one
in
spite
of
her
disfigurement
with
smallpox
strove
to
imagine
that
i
was
in
love
with
sonetchka
for
the
purpose
of
priding
myself
on
holding
to
my
troth
in
spite
of
her
scars
yet
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
not
really
in
love
with
her
during
that
drive
but
having
once
stirred
up
in
myself
old
memories
of
love
felt
prepared
to
fall
into
that
condition
and
the
more
so
because
of
late
my
conscience
had
often
been
pricking
me
for
having
discarded
so
many
of
my
old
flames
the
valakhins
lived
in
a
neat
little
wooden
mansion
approached
by
a
courtyard
i
gained
admittance
by
ringing
a
bell
then
a
rarity
in
moscow
and
was
received
by
a
mincing
page
he
either
could
not
or
made
no
attempt
to
inform
me
whether
there
was
any
one
at
home
but
leaving
me
alone
in
the
dark
hall
ran
off
down
a
still
darker
corridor
for
a
long
time
i
waited
in
solitude
in
this
gloomy
place
out
of
which
in
addition
to
the
front
door
and
the
corridor
there
only
opened
a
door
which
at
the
moment
was
closed
rather
surprised
at
the
dismal
appearance
of
the
house
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
reason
was
that
its
inmates
were
still
abroad
after
five
minutes
however
the
door
leading
into
the
salon
was
opened
by
the
page
boy
who
then
conducted
me
into
a
neat
but
not
richly
furnished
where
presently
i
was
joined
by
sonetchka
she
was
now
seventeen
years
old
and
very
small
and
thin
as
well
as
of
an
unhealthy
pallor
of
face
no
scars
at
all
were
visible
however
and
the
beautiful
prominent
eyes
and
bright
cheerful
smile
were
the
same
as
i
had
known
and
loved
in
my
childhood
i
had
not
expected
her
to
look
at
all
like
this
and
therefore
could
not
at
once
lavish
upon
her
the
sentiment
which
i
had
been
preparing
on
the
way
she
gave
me
her
hand
in
the
english
fashion
which
was
then
as
much
a
novelty
as
a
and
bestowing
upon
mine
a
frank
squeeze
sat
down
on
the
sofa
by
my
side
ah
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
my
dear
nicolas
she
said
as
she
looked
me
in
the
face
with
an
expression
of
pleasure
so
sincere
that
in
the
words
my
dear
nicolas
i
caught
the
purely
friendly
rather
than
the
patronising
note
to
my
surprise
she
seemed
to
me
simpler
kinder
and
more
sisterly
after
her
foreign
tour
than
she
had
been
before
it
true
i
could
now
see
that
she
had
two
small
scars
between
her
nose
and
temples
but
her
wonderful
eyes
and
smile
fitted
in
exactly
with
my
recollections
and
shone
as
of
old
but
how
greatly
you
have
changed
she
went
on
you
are
quite
now
and
what
do
you
think
of
me
i
should
never
have
known
you
i
replied
despite
the
fact
that
at
the
moment
i
was
thinking
that
i
should
have
known
her
anywhere
and
always
why
am
i
grown
so
ugly
she
inquired
with
a
movement
of
her
head
oh
no
decidedly
not
i
hastened
to
reply
but
you
have
grown
taller
and
older
as
for
being
uglier
why
you
are
even
yes
yes
never
mind
do
you
remember
our
dances
and
games
and
jerome
and
madame
dorat
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
could
not
recollect
any
madame
dorat
but
saw
that
sonetchka
was
being
led
away
by
the
joy
of
her
childish
recollections
and
mixing
them
up
a
little
ah
what
a
lovely
time
it
was
she
went
on
and
once
more
there
shone
before
me
the
same
eyes
and
smile
as
i
had
always
carried
in
my
memory
while
she
had
been
speaking
i
had
been
thinking
over
my
position
at
the
present
moment
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
was
in
love
with
her
the
instant
however
that
i
arrived
at
that
result
my
careless
happy
mood
vanished
a
mist
seemed
to
arise
before
me
which
concealed
even
her
eyes
and
smile
and
blushing
hotly
i
became
and
but
times
are
different
now
she
went
on
with
a
sigh
and
a
little
lifting
of
her
eyebrows
everything
seems
worse
than
it
used
to
be
and
ourselves
too
is
it
not
so
nicolas
i
could
return
her
no
answer
but
sat
silently
looking
at
her
where
are
those
iwins
and
kornakoffs
now
do
you
remember
them
she
continued
looking
i
think
with
some
curiosity
at
my
blushing
downcast
countenance
what
splendid
times
we
used
to
have
still
i
could
not
answer
her
the
next
moment
i
was
relieved
from
this
awkward
position
by
the
entry
of
old
madame
valakhin
into
the
room
rising
i
bowed
and
straightway
recovered
my
faculty
of
speech
on
the
other
hand
an
extraordinary
change
now
took
place
in
sonetchka
all
her
gaiety
and
bonhomie
disappeared
her
smile
became
quite
a
different
one
and
except
for
the
point
of
her
shortness
of
stature
she
became
just
the
lady
from
abroad
whom
i
had
expected
to
find
in
her
yet
for
this
change
there
was
no
apparent
reason
since
her
mother
smiled
every
whit
as
pleasantly
and
expressed
in
her
every
movement
just
the
same
benignity
as
of
old
seating
herself
in
her
the
old
lady
signed
to
me
to
come
and
sit
beside
her
after
which
she
said
something
to
her
daughter
in
english
and
sonetchka
left
the
room
a
fact
which
still
further
helped
to
relieve
me
madame
then
inquired
after
my
father
and
brother
and
passed
on
to
speak
of
her
great
bereavement
the
loss
of
her
husband
presently
however
she
seemed
to
become
sensible
of
the
fact
that
i
was
not
helping
much
in
the
conversation
for
she
gave
me
a
look
as
much
as
to
say
if
now
my
dear
boy
you
were
to
get
up
to
take
your
leave
and
to
depart
it
would
be
but
a
curious
circumstance
had
overtaken
me
while
she
had
been
speaking
of
her
bereavement
i
had
recalled
to
myself
not
only
the
fact
that
i
was
in
love
but
the
probability
that
the
mother
knew
of
it
whereupon
such
a
fit
of
bashfulness
had
come
upon
me
that
i
felt
powerless
to
put
any
member
of
my
body
to
its
legitimate
use
i
knew
that
if
i
were
to
rise
and
walk
i
should
have
to
think
where
to
plant
each
foot
what
to
do
with
my
head
what
with
my
hands
and
so
on
in
a
word
i
foresaw
that
i
should
be
very
much
as
i
had
been
on
the
night
when
i
partook
too
freely
of
champagne
and
therefore
since
i
felt
uncertain
of
being
able
to
manage
myself
if
i
did
rise
i
ended
by
feeling
unable
to
rise
meanwhile
i
should
say
sonetchka
had
returned
to
the
room
with
her
work
and
seated
herself
in
a
far
corner
a
corner
whence
as
i
was
nevertheless
sensible
she
could
observe
me
madame
must
have
felt
some
surprise
as
she
gazed
at
my
crimson
face
and
noted
my
complete
immobility
but
i
decided
that
it
was
better
to
continue
sitting
in
that
absurd
position
than
to
risk
something
unpleasant
by
getting
up
and
walking
thus
i
sat
on
and
on
in
the
hope
that
some
unforeseen
chance
would
deliver
me
from
my
predicament
that
unforeseen
chance
at
length
presented
itself
in
the
person
of
an
unforeseen
young
man
who
entered
the
room
with
an
air
of
being
one
of
the
household
and
bowed
to
me
politely
as
he
did
so
whereupon
madame
rose
excused
herself
to
me
for
having
to
speak
with
her
homme
d
affaires
and
finally
gave
me
a
glance
which
said
well
if
you
do
mean
to
go
on
sitting
there
for
ever
at
least
i
can
t
drive
you
accordingly
with
a
great
effort
i
also
rose
but
finding
it
impossible
to
do
any
moved
away
towards
the
door
followed
by
the
pitying
glances
of
mother
and
daughter
all
at
once
i
stumbled
over
a
chair
although
it
was
lying
quite
out
of
my
route
the
reason
for
my
stumbling
being
that
my
whole
attention
was
centred
upon
not
tripping
over
the
carpet
driving
through
the
fresh
air
however
where
at
first
i
muttered
and
fidgeted
about
so
much
that
kuzma
my
coachman
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
i
soon
found
this
feeling
pass
away
and
began
to
meditate
quietly
concerning
my
love
for
sonetchka
and
her
relations
with
her
mother
which
had
appeared
to
me
rather
strange
when
afterwards
i
told
my
father
that
mother
and
daughter
had
not
seemed
on
the
best
of
terms
with
one
another
he
said
yes
madame
leads
the
poor
girl
an
awful
life
with
her
meanness
yet
added
my
father
with
a
greater
display
of
feeling
than
a
man
might
naturally
conceive
for
a
mere
relative
she
used
to
be
such
an
original
dear
charming
woman
i
can
not
think
what
has
made
her
change
so
much
by
the
way
you
didn
t
notice
a
secretary
fellow
about
did
you
fancy
a
russian
lady
having
an
affaire
with
a
secretary
yes
i
saw
him
i
replied
and
was
he
at
least
no
not
at
it
is
extraordinary
concluded
papa
with
a
cough
and
an
irritable
hoist
of
his
shoulder
well
i
am
in
love
was
my
secret
thought
to
myself
as
i
drove
along
in
my
drozhki
xix
the
kornakoffs
my
second
call
on
the
route
lay
at
the
kornakoffs
who
lived
on
the
first
floor
of
a
large
mansion
facing
the
arbat
the
staircase
of
the
building
looked
extremely
neat
and
orderly
yet
in
no
way
luxurious
being
lined
only
with
drugget
pinned
down
with
brass
rods
nowhere
were
there
any
flowers
or
mirrors
to
be
seen
the
salon
too
with
its
polished
floor
which
i
traversed
on
my
way
to
the
was
decorated
in
the
same
cold
severe
unostentatious
style
everything
in
it
looked
bright
and
solid
but
not
new
and
pictures
and
articles
of
were
wholly
absent
in
the
i
found
some
of
the
young
princesses
seated
but
seated
with
the
sort
of
correct
company
air
about
them
which
gave
one
the
impression
that
they
sat
like
that
only
when
guests
were
expected
mamma
will
be
here
presently
the
eldest
of
them
said
to
me
as
she
seated
herself
by
my
side
for
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
this
young
lady
entertained
me
with
such
an
easy
flow
of
that
the
conversation
never
flagged
a
moment
yet
somehow
she
made
so
patent
the
fact
that
she
was
just
entertaining
me
that
i
felt
not
altogether
pleased
amongst
other
things
she
told
me
that
their
brother
stephen
whom
they
called
etienne
and
who
had
been
two
years
at
the
college
of
cadets
had
now
received
his
commission
whenever
she
spoke
of
him
and
more
particularly
when
she
told
me
that
he
had
flouted
his
mother
s
wishes
by
entering
the
hussars
she
assumed
a
nervous
air
and
immediately
her
sisters
sitting
there
in
silence
also
assumed
a
nervous
air
when
again
she
spoke
of
my
grandmother
s
death
she
assumed
a
mournful
air
and
immediately
the
others
all
did
the
same
finally
when
she
recalled
how
i
had
once
struck
jerome
and
been
expelled
from
the
room
she
laughed
and
showed
her
bad
teeth
and
immediately
all
the
other
princesses
laughed
and
showed
their
bad
teeth
too
next
the
herself
entered
a
little
woman
with
a
wandering
glance
and
a
habit
of
always
looking
at
somebody
else
when
she
was
addressing
one
taking
my
hand
she
raised
her
own
to
my
lips
for
me
to
kiss
it
which
otherwise
not
supposing
it
to
be
necessary
i
should
not
have
done
how
pleased
i
am
to
see
you
she
said
with
her
usual
clearness
of
articulation
as
she
gazed
at
her
daughters
and
how
like
your
mother
you
look
does
he
not
lise
lise
assented
though
i
knew
for
a
fact
that
i
did
not
resemble
my
mother
in
the
least
and
what
a
you
have
become
my
etienne
you
will
remember
is
your
second
cousin
no
not
second
cousin
what
is
it
lise
my
mother
was
barbara
dimitrievna
daughter
of
dimitri
nicolaevitch
and
your
grandmother
was
natalia
then
he
is
our
third
cousin
mamma
said
the
eldest
girl
oh
how
you
always
confuse
me
was
her
mother
s
angry
reply
not
third
cousin
but
cousin
german
that
is
your
relationship
to
etienne
he
is
an
officer
now
did
you
know
it
it
is
not
well
that
he
should
have
his
own
way
too
much
you
young
men
need
keeping
in
hand
or
well
you
are
not
vexed
because
your
old
aunt
tells
you
the
plain
truth
i
always
kept
etienne
strictly
in
hand
for
i
found
it
necessary
to
do
yes
that
is
how
our
relationship
stands
she
went
on
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
is
my
uncle
and
your
late
mother
s
uncle
also
consequently
i
must
have
been
your
mother
s
first
cousin
no
second
cousin
yes
that
is
it
tell
me
have
you
been
to
call
on
prince
ivan
yet
i
said
no
but
that
i
was
just
going
to
ah
is
it
possible
she
cried
why
you
ought
to
have
paid
him
the
first
call
of
all
surely
you
know
that
he
stands
to
you
in
the
position
of
a
father
he
has
no
children
of
his
own
and
his
only
heirs
are
yourself
and
my
children
you
ought
to
pay
him
all
possible
deference
both
because
of
his
age
and
because
of
his
position
in
the
world
and
because
of
everything
else
i
know
that
you
young
fellows
of
the
present
day
think
nothing
of
relationships
and
are
not
fond
of
old
men
yet
do
you
listen
to
me
your
old
aunt
for
i
am
fond
of
you
and
was
fond
of
your
mother
and
had
a
great
a
very
and
respect
for
your
grandmother
you
must
not
fail
to
call
upon
him
on
any
i
said
that
i
would
certainly
go
and
since
my
present
call
seemed
to
me
to
have
lasted
long
enough
i
rose
and
was
about
to
depart
but
she
restrained
me
no
wait
a
minute
she
cried
where
is
your
father
lise
go
and
tell
him
to
come
here
he
will
be
so
glad
to
see
you
she
added
turning
to
me
two
minutes
later
prince
michael
entered
he
was
a
short
gentleman
very
slovenly
dressed
and
yet
wearing
such
an
air
of
indifference
that
he
looked
almost
a
fool
he
was
not
in
the
least
glad
to
see
me
at
all
events
he
did
not
intimate
that
he
was
but
the
princess
who
appeared
to
stand
in
considerable
awe
of
him
hastened
to
say
is
not
woldemar
here
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
my
name
exactly
like
his
mother
and
she
gave
her
husband
a
glance
which
forced
him
to
guess
what
she
wanted
accordingly
he
approached
me
with
his
usual
passionless
expression
and
held
out
to
me
an
unshaven
cheek
to
kiss
why
you
are
not
dressed
yet
though
you
have
to
go
out
soon
was
the
princess
s
next
remark
to
him
in
the
angry
tone
which
she
habitually
employed
in
conversation
with
her
domestics
it
will
only
mean
your
offending
some
one
again
and
trying
to
set
people
against
in
a
moment
in
a
moment
mother
said
prince
michael
and
departed
i
also
made
my
bows
and
departed
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
of
our
being
related
to
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
and
the
news
struck
me
unpleasantly
xx
the
iwins
as
for
the
prospect
of
my
call
upon
the
prince
it
seemed
even
more
unpleasant
however
the
order
of
my
route
took
me
first
to
the
iwins
who
lived
in
a
large
and
splendid
mansion
in
tverskaia
street
it
was
not
without
some
nervousness
that
i
entered
the
great
portico
where
a
swiss
stood
armed
with
his
staff
of
office
to
my
inquiry
as
to
whether
any
one
was
at
home
he
replied
whom
do
you
wish
to
see
sir
the
general
s
son
is
and
the
general
himself
i
asked
with
forced
assurance
i
must
report
to
him
your
business
first
what
may
it
be
sir
said
the
as
he
rang
a
bell
immediately
the
gaitered
legs
of
a
footman
showed
themselves
on
the
staircase
above
whereupon
i
was
seized
with
such
a
fit
of
nervousness
that
i
hastily
bid
the
lacquey
say
nothing
about
my
presence
to
the
general
since
i
would
first
see
his
son
by
the
time
i
had
reached
the
top
of
the
long
staircase
i
seemed
to
have
grown
extremely
small
metaphorically
i
mean
not
actually
and
had
very
much
the
same
feeling
within
me
as
had
possessed
my
soul
when
my
drozhki
drew
up
to
the
great
portico
namely
a
feeling
as
though
drozhki
horse
and
coachman
had
all
of
them
grown
extremely
small
too
i
found
the
general
s
son
lying
asleep
on
a
sofa
with
an
open
book
before
him
his
tutor
monsieur
frost
under
whose
care
he
still
pursued
his
studies
at
home
had
entered
behind
me
with
a
sort
of
boyish
tread
and
now
awoke
his
pupil
iwin
evinced
no
particular
pleasure
at
seeing
me
while
i
also
seemed
to
notice
that
while
talking
to
me
he
kept
looking
at
my
eyebrows
although
he
was
perfectly
polite
i
conceived
that
he
was
entertaining
me
much
as
the
princess
valakhin
had
done
and
that
he
not
only
felt
no
particular
liking
for
me
but
even
that
he
considered
my
acquaintance
in
no
way
necessary
to
one
who
possessed
his
own
circle
of
friends
all
this
arose
out
of
the
idea
that
he
was
regarding
my
eyebrows
in
short
his
bearing
towards
me
appeared
to
be
as
i
recognised
with
an
awkward
sensation
very
much
the
same
as
my
own
towards
ilinka
grap
i
began
to
feel
irritated
and
to
interpret
every
fleeting
glance
which
he
cast
at
monsieur
frost
as
a
mute
inquiry
why
has
this
fellow
come
to
see
me
after
some
conversation
he
remarked
that
his
father
and
mother
were
at
home
would
i
not
like
to
visit
them
too
first
i
will
go
and
dress
myself
he
added
as
he
departed
to
another
room
notwithstanding
that
he
had
seemed
to
be
perfectly
well
dressed
in
a
new
frockcoat
and
white
waistcoat
in
the
present
one
a
few
minutes
later
he
reappeared
in
his
university
uniform
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
and
we
went
downstairs
together
the
reception
rooms
through
which
we
passed
were
lofty
and
of
great
size
and
seemed
to
be
richly
furnished
with
marble
and
gilt
ornaments
settees
and
a
number
of
mirrors
presently
madame
iwin
met
us
and
we
went
into
a
little
room
behind
the
where
welcoming
me
in
very
friendly
fashion
she
seated
herself
by
my
side
and
began
to
inquire
after
my
relations
closer
acquaintance
with
madame
whom
i
had
seen
only
twice
before
and
that
but
for
a
moment
on
each
occasion
impressed
me
favourably
she
was
tall
thin
and
very
pale
and
looked
as
though
she
suffered
from
chronic
depression
and
fatigue
yet
though
her
smile
was
a
sad
one
it
was
very
kind
and
her
large
mournful
eyes
with
a
slight
cast
in
their
vision
added
to
the
pathos
and
attractiveness
of
her
expression
her
attitude
while
not
precisely
that
of
a
hunchback
made
her
whole
form
droop
while
her
every
movement
expressed
languor
likewise
though
her
speech
was
deliberate
the
timbre
of
her
voice
and
the
manner
in
which
she
lisped
her
r
s
and
l
s
were
very
pleasing
to
the
ear
finally
she
did
not
entertain
me
unfortunately
the
answers
which
i
returned
to
her
questions
concerning
my
relations
seemed
to
afford
her
a
painful
interest
and
to
remind
her
of
happier
days
with
the
result
that
when
presently
her
son
left
the
room
she
gazed
at
me
in
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
burst
into
tears
as
i
sat
there
in
mute
bewilderment
i
could
not
conceive
what
i
had
said
to
bring
this
about
at
first
i
felt
sorry
for
her
as
she
sat
there
weeping
with
downcast
eyes
next
i
began
to
think
to
myself
ought
i
not
to
try
and
comfort
her
and
how
ought
that
to
be
done
finally
i
began
to
feel
vexed
with
her
for
placing
me
in
such
an
awkward
position
surely
my
appearance
is
not
so
moving
as
all
that
i
reflected
or
is
she
merely
acting
like
this
to
see
what
i
shall
do
under
the
circumstances
yet
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
go
i
continued
to
myself
for
that
would
look
too
much
as
though
i
were
fleeing
to
escape
her
accordingly
i
began
fidgeting
about
on
my
seat
in
order
to
remind
her
of
my
presence
oh
how
foolish
of
me
at
length
she
said
as
she
gazed
at
me
for
a
moment
and
tried
to
smile
there
are
days
when
one
weeps
for
no
reason
she
felt
about
for
her
handkerchief
and
then
burst
out
weeping
more
violently
than
before
oh
dear
how
silly
of
me
to
be
for
ever
crying
like
this
yet
i
was
so
fond
of
your
mother
we
were
such
friends
at
this
point
she
found
her
handkerchief
and
burying
her
face
in
it
went
on
crying
once
more
i
found
myself
in
the
same
protracted
dilemma
though
vexed
i
felt
sorry
for
her
since
her
tears
appeared
to
be
genuine
even
though
i
also
had
an
idea
that
it
was
not
so
much
for
my
mother
that
she
was
weeping
as
for
the
fact
that
she
was
unhappy
and
had
known
happier
days
how
it
would
all
have
ended
i
do
not
know
had
not
her
son
reappeared
and
said
that
his
father
desired
to
see
her
thereupon
she
rose
and
was
just
about
to
leave
the
room
when
the
general
himself
entered
he
was
a
small
grizzled
man
with
bushy
black
eyebrows
a
grey
head
and
a
very
stern
haughty
expression
of
countenance
i
rose
and
bowed
to
him
but
the
general
who
was
wearing
three
stars
on
his
green
frockcoat
not
only
made
no
response
to
my
salutation
but
scarcely
even
looked
at
me
so
that
all
at
once
i
felt
as
though
i
were
not
a
human
being
at
all
but
only
some
negligible
object
such
as
a
settee
or
window
or
if
i
were
a
human
being
as
though
i
were
quite
indistinguishable
from
such
a
negligible
object
then
you
have
not
yet
written
to
the
countess
my
dear
he
said
to
his
wife
in
french
and
with
an
imperturbable
yet
determined
expression
on
his
countenance
monsieur
irtenieff
madame
said
to
me
in
her
turn
as
she
made
a
proud
gesture
with
her
head
and
looked
at
my
eyebrows
just
as
her
son
had
done
i
bowed
to
her
and
again
to
her
husband
but
my
second
salutation
made
no
more
impression
upon
him
than
if
a
window
had
just
been
opened
or
closed
nevertheless
the
younger
iwin
accompanied
me
to
the
door
and
on
the
way
told
me
that
he
was
to
go
to
petersburg
university
since
his
father
had
been
appointed
to
a
post
in
that
city
and
young
iwin
named
a
very
high
office
in
the
service
well
his
papa
may
do
whatsoever
he
likes
i
muttered
to
myself
as
i
climbed
into
the
drozhki
but
at
all
events
i
will
never
set
foot
in
that
house
again
his
wife
weeps
and
looks
at
me
as
though
i
were
the
embodiment
of
woe
while
that
old
pig
of
a
general
does
not
even
give
me
a
bow
however
i
will
get
even
with
him
some
how
i
meant
to
do
that
i
do
not
know
but
my
words
nevertheless
came
true
afterwards
i
frequently
found
it
necessary
to
remember
the
advice
of
my
father
when
he
said
that
i
must
cultivate
the
acquaintanceship
of
the
iwins
and
not
expect
a
man
in
the
position
of
general
iwin
to
pay
any
attention
to
a
boy
like
myself
but
i
had
figured
in
that
position
long
enough
xxi
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
now
for
the
last
call
the
visit
to
nikitskaia
street
i
said
to
kuzma
and
we
started
for
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
s
mansion
towards
the
end
a
round
of
calls
usually
brings
one
a
certain
amount
of
consequently
i
was
approaching
the
prince
s
abode
in
quite
a
tranquil
frame
of
mind
when
suddenly
i
remembered
the
princess
kornakoff
s
words
that
i
was
his
heir
and
at
the
same
moment
caught
sight
of
two
carriages
waiting
at
the
portico
instantly
my
former
nervousness
returned
both
the
old
who
opened
the
door
to
me
and
the
footman
who
took
my
coat
and
the
two
male
and
three
female
visitors
whom
i
found
in
the
and
most
of
all
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
himself
whom
i
found
clad
in
a
company
frockcoat
and
seated
on
a
sofa
seemed
to
look
at
me
as
at
an
heir
and
so
to
eye
me
with
yet
the
prince
was
very
gracious
and
after
kissing
me
that
is
to
say
after
pressing
his
cold
dry
flabby
lips
to
my
cheek
for
a
second
asked
me
about
my
plans
and
pursuits
jested
with
me
inquired
whether
i
still
wrote
verses
of
the
kind
which
i
used
to
indite
in
honour
of
my
grandmother
s
birthdays
and
invited
me
to
dine
with
him
that
day
nevertheless
in
proportion
as
he
grew
the
kinder
the
more
did
i
feel
persuaded
that
his
civility
was
only
intended
to
conceal
from
me
the
fact
that
he
disliked
the
idea
of
my
being
his
heir
he
had
a
custom
due
to
his
false
teeth
of
which
his
mouth
possessed
a
complete
set
of
raising
his
upper
lip
a
little
as
he
spoke
and
producing
a
slight
whistling
sound
from
it
and
whenever
on
the
present
occasion
he
did
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
saying
to
himself
a
boy
a
boy
i
know
it
and
my
heir
too
my
heir
when
we
were
children
we
had
been
used
to
calling
the
prince
dear
uncle
but
now
in
my
capacity
of
heir
i
could
not
bring
my
tongue
to
the
phrase
while
to
say
your
highness
as
did
one
of
the
other
visitors
seemed
derogatory
to
my
consequently
never
once
during
that
visit
did
i
call
him
anything
at
all
the
personage
however
who
most
disturbed
me
was
the
old
princess
who
shared
with
me
the
position
of
prospective
inheritor
and
who
lived
in
the
prince
s
house
while
seated
beside
her
at
dinner
i
felt
firmly
persuaded
that
the
reason
why
she
would
not
speak
to
me
was
that
she
disliked
me
for
being
her
and
that
the
prince
for
his
part
paid
no
attention
to
our
side
of
the
table
for
the
reason
that
the
princess
and
myself
hoped
to
succeed
him
and
so
were
alike
distasteful
in
his
sight
you
can
not
think
how
i
hated
it
all
i
said
to
dimitrieff
the
same
evening
in
a
desire
to
make
a
parade
of
disliking
the
notion
of
being
an
heir
somehow
i
thought
it
the
thing
to
do
you
can
not
think
how
i
loathed
the
whole
two
hours
that
i
spent
there
yet
he
is
a
old
fellow
and
was
very
kind
to
me
i
added
wishing
among
other
things
to
disabuse
my
friend
of
any
possible
idea
that
my
loathing
had
arisen
out
of
the
fact
that
i
had
felt
so
small
it
is
only
the
idea
that
people
may
be
classing
me
with
the
princess
who
lives
with
him
and
who
licks
the
dust
off
his
boots
he
is
a
wonderful
old
man
and
good
and
considerate
to
everybody
but
it
is
awful
to
see
how
he
treats
the
princess
money
is
a
detestable
thing
and
ruins
all
human
relations
do
you
know
i
think
it
would
be
far
the
best
thing
for
me
to
have
an
open
explanation
with
the
prince
i
went
on
to
tell
him
that
i
respect
him
as
a
man
but
think
nothing
of
being
his
heir
and
that
i
desire
him
to
leave
me
nothing
since
that
is
the
only
condition
on
which
i
can
in
future
visit
his
instead
of
bursting
out
laughing
when
i
said
this
dimitri
pondered
awhile
in
silence
and
then
answered
you
are
wrong
either
you
ought
to
refrain
from
supposing
that
people
may
be
classing
you
with
this
princess
of
whom
you
speak
or
if
you
do
suppose
such
a
thing
you
ought
to
suppose
further
that
people
are
thinking
what
you
yourself
know
quite
well
namely
that
such
thoughts
are
so
utterly
foreign
to
your
nature
that
you
despise
them
and
would
never
make
them
a
basis
for
action
suppose
however
that
people
do
suppose
you
to
suppose
such
a
thing
well
to
sum
up
he
added
feeling
that
he
was
getting
a
little
mixed
in
his
pronouncements
you
had
much
better
not
suppose
anything
of
the
my
friend
was
perfectly
right
though
it
was
not
until
long
long
afterwards
that
experience
of
life
taught
me
the
evil
that
comes
of
thinking
still
worse
of
saying
much
that
seems
very
fine
taught
me
that
there
are
certain
thoughts
which
should
always
be
kept
to
oneself
since
brave
words
seldom
go
with
brave
deeds
i
learnt
then
that
the
mere
fact
of
giving
utterance
to
a
good
intention
often
makes
it
difficult
nay
impossible
to
carry
that
good
intention
into
effect
yet
how
is
one
to
refrain
from
giving
utterance
to
the
brave
impulses
of
youth
only
long
afterwards
does
one
remember
and
regret
them
even
as
one
incontinently
plucks
a
flower
before
its
blooming
and
subsequently
finds
it
lying
crushed
and
withered
on
the
ground
the
very
next
morning
i
who
had
just
been
telling
my
friend
dimitri
that
money
corrupts
all
human
relations
and
had
as
we
have
seen
squandered
the
whole
of
my
cash
on
pictures
and
turkish
pipes
accepted
a
loan
of
twenty
roubles
which
he
suggested
should
pay
for
my
travelling
expenses
into
the
country
and
remained
a
long
while
thereafter
in
his
debt
xxii
intimate
conversation
with
my
friend
this
conversation
of
ours
took
place
in
a
phaeton
on
the
way
to
kuntsevo
dimitri
had
invited
me
in
the
morning
to
go
with
him
to
his
mother
s
and
had
called
for
me
after
luncheon
the
idea
being
that
i
should
spend
the
evening
and
perhaps
also
pass
the
night
at
the
where
his
family
lived
only
when
we
had
left
the
city
and
exchanged
its
grimy
streets
and
the
unbearably
deafening
clatter
of
its
pavements
for
the
open
vista
of
fields
and
the
subdued
grinding
of
on
a
dusty
high
road
while
the
sweet
spring
air
and
prospect
enveloped
us
on
every
side
did
i
awake
from
the
new
impressions
and
sensations
of
freedom
into
which
the
past
two
days
had
plunged
me
dimitri
was
in
his
kind
and
sociable
mood
that
is
to
say
he
was
neither
frowning
nor
blinking
nervously
nor
straightening
his
neck
in
his
collar
for
my
own
part
i
was
congratulating
myself
on
those
noble
sentiments
which
i
have
expressed
above
in
the
belief
that
they
had
led
him
to
overlook
my
shameful
encounter
with
kolpikoff
and
to
refrain
from
despising
me
for
it
thus
we
talked
together
on
many
an
intimate
subject
which
even
a
friend
seldom
mentions
to
a
friend
he
told
me
about
his
family
whose
acquaintance
i
had
not
yet
made
about
his
mother
his
aunt
and
his
sister
as
also
about
her
whom
woloda
and
dubkoff
believed
to
be
his
flame
and
always
spoke
of
as
the
lady
with
the
chestnut
of
his
mother
he
spoke
with
a
certain
cold
and
formal
commendation
as
though
to
forestall
any
further
mention
of
her
his
aunt
he
extolled
enthusiastically
though
with
a
touch
of
condescension
in
his
tone
his
sister
he
scarcely
mentioned
at
all
as
though
averse
to
doing
so
in
my
presence
but
on
the
subject
of
the
lady
with
the
chestnut
locks
whose
real
name
was
lubov
sergievna
and
who
was
a
young
lady
living
on
a
family
footing
with
the
nechludoffs
he
discoursed
with
animation
yes
she
is
a
wonderful
woman
he
said
with
a
conscious
reddening
of
the
face
yet
looking
me
in
the
eyes
with
dogged
temerity
true
she
is
no
longer
young
and
even
rather
elderly
as
well
as
by
no
means
but
as
for
loving
a
mere
featherhead
a
mere
beauty
well
i
never
could
understand
that
for
it
is
such
a
silly
thing
to
dimitri
said
this
as
though
he
had
just
discovered
a
most
novel
and
extraordinary
truth
i
am
certain
too
that
such
a
soul
such
a
heart
and
principles
as
are
hers
are
not
to
be
found
elsewhere
in
the
world
of
the
present
i
do
not
know
whence
he
had
derived
the
habit
of
saying
that
few
good
things
were
discoverable
in
the
world
of
the
present
day
but
at
all
events
he
loved
to
repeat
the
expression
and
it
somehow
suited
him
only
i
am
afraid
he
went
on
quietly
after
thus
annihilating
all
such
men
as
were
foolish
enough
to
admire
mere
beauty
i
am
afraid
that
you
will
not
understand
or
realise
her
quickly
she
is
modest
even
secretive
and
by
no
means
fond
of
exhibiting
her
beautiful
and
surprising
qualities
now
my
mother
who
as
you
will
see
is
a
noble
sensible
woman
has
known
lubov
sergievna
for
many
years
yet
even
to
this
day
she
does
not
properly
understand
her
shall
i
tell
you
why
i
was
out
of
temper
last
evening
when
you
were
questioning
me
well
you
must
know
that
the
day
before
yesterday
lubov
asked
me
to
accompany
her
to
ivan
yakovlevitch
s
you
have
heard
of
him
i
suppose
the
fellow
who
seems
to
be
mad
but
who
in
reality
is
a
very
remarkable
man
well
lubov
is
extremely
religious
and
understands
ivan
yakovlevitch
to
the
full
she
often
goes
to
see
him
and
converses
with
him
and
gives
him
money
for
the
poor
money
which
she
has
earned
herself
she
is
a
marvellous
woman
as
you
will
see
well
i
went
with
her
to
ivan
s
and
felt
very
grateful
to
her
for
having
afforded
me
the
opportunity
of
exchanging
a
word
with
so
remarkable
a
man
but
my
mother
could
not
understand
our
action
at
all
and
discerned
in
it
only
superstition
consequently
last
night
she
and
i
quarrelled
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
a
very
bitter
one
it
was
too
he
concluded
with
a
convulsive
shrug
of
his
shoulders
as
though
the
mention
of
it
recalled
the
feelings
which
he
had
then
experienced
and
what
are
your
intentions
about
it
all
i
inquired
to
divert
him
from
such
a
disagreeable
recollection
that
is
to
say
how
do
you
imagine
it
is
going
to
turn
out
do
you
ever
speak
to
her
about
the
future
or
about
how
your
love
or
friendship
are
going
to
end
do
you
mean
do
i
intend
to
marry
her
eventually
he
inquired
in
his
turn
with
a
renewed
blush
but
turning
himself
round
and
looking
me
boldly
in
the
face
yes
certainly
i
replied
as
i
settled
myself
down
we
are
both
of
us
as
well
as
friends
so
we
may
as
well
discuss
our
future
life
as
we
drive
along
no
one
could
very
well
overlook
or
overhear
us
why
should
i
not
marry
her
he
went
on
in
response
to
my
reassuring
reply
it
is
my
aim
as
it
should
be
the
aim
of
every
honourable
man
to
be
as
good
and
as
happy
as
possible
and
with
her
if
she
should
still
be
willing
when
i
have
become
more
independent
i
should
be
happier
and
better
than
with
the
greatest
beauty
in
the
absorbed
in
such
conversation
we
hardly
noticed
that
we
were
approaching
kuntsevo
or
that
the
sky
was
becoming
overcast
and
beginning
to
threaten
rain
on
the
right
the
sun
was
slowly
sinking
behind
the
ancient
trees
of
the
kuntsevo
park
one
half
of
its
brilliant
disc
obscured
with
grey
subluminous
cloud
and
the
other
half
sending
forth
spokes
of
flaming
light
which
threw
the
old
trees
into
striking
relief
as
they
stood
there
with
their
dense
crowns
of
green
showing
against
a
blue
patch
of
sky
the
light
and
shimmer
of
that
patch
contrasted
sharply
with
the
heavy
pink
cloud
which
lay
massed
above
a
young
visible
on
the
horizon
before
us
while
a
little
further
to
the
right
the
roofs
of
the
kuntsevo
mansion
could
be
seen
projecting
above
a
belt
of
trees
and
undergrowth
one
side
of
them
reflecting
the
glittering
rays
of
the
sun
and
the
other
side
harmonising
with
the
more
louring
portion
of
the
heavens
below
us
and
to
the
left
showed
the
still
blue
of
a
pond
where
it
lay
surrounded
with
laburnums
its
dull
depths
repeating
the
trees
in
more
sombre
shades
of
colour
over
the
surface
of
a
hillock
beyond
the
water
spread
the
black
expanse
of
a
ploughed
field
with
the
straight
line
of
a
ridge
by
which
it
was
bisected
running
far
into
the
distance
and
there
joining
the
leaden
threatening
horizon
on
either
side
of
the
soft
road
along
which
the
phaeton
was
pursuing
the
even
tenour
of
its
way
tangled
juicy
belts
of
rye
were
sprouting
here
and
there
into
stalk
not
a
motion
was
perceptible
in
the
air
only
a
sweet
freshness
and
everything
looked
extraordinarily
clear
and
bright
near
the
road
i
could
see
a
little
brown
path
winding
its
way
among
the
stems
of
rye
and
somehow
that
path
reminded
me
vividly
of
our
village
and
somehow
through
some
connection
of
thought
the
idea
of
that
village
reminded
me
vividly
of
sonetchka
and
so
of
the
fact
that
i
was
in
love
with
her
notwithstanding
my
fondness
for
dimitri
and
the
pleasure
which
his
frankness
had
afforded
me
i
now
felt
as
though
i
desired
to
hear
no
more
about
his
feelings
and
intentions
with
regard
to
lubov
sergievna
but
to
talk
unstintedly
about
my
own
love
for
sonetchka
who
seemed
to
me
an
object
of
affection
of
a
far
higher
order
yet
for
some
reason
or
another
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
tell
him
straight
out
how
splendid
it
would
seem
when
i
had
married
sonetchka
and
we
were
living
in
the
country
of
how
we
should
have
little
children
who
would
crawl
about
the
floor
and
call
me
papa
and
of
how
delighted
i
should
be
when
he
dimitri
brought
his
wife
lubov
sergievna
to
see
us
wearing
an
expensive
gown
accordingly
instead
of
saying
all
that
i
pointed
to
the
setting
sun
and
merely
remarked
look
dimitri
how
splendid
to
this
however
dimitri
made
no
reply
since
he
was
evidently
dissatisfied
at
my
answering
his
confession
which
it
had
cost
him
much
to
make
by
directing
his
attention
to
natural
objects
to
which
he
was
in
general
indifferent
upon
him
nature
had
an
effect
altogether
different
to
what
she
had
upon
myself
for
she
affected
him
rather
by
her
industry
than
by
her
beauty
he
loved
her
rather
with
his
intellect
than
with
his
senses
i
am
absolutely
happy
i
went
on
without
noticing
that
he
was
altogether
taken
up
with
his
own
thoughts
and
oblivious
of
anything
that
i
might
be
saying
you
will
remember
how
told
you
about
a
girl
with
whom
i
used
to
be
in
love
when
was
a
little
boy
well
i
saw
her
again
only
this
morning
and
am
now
infatuated
with
then
i
told
him
despite
his
continued
expression
of
indifference
about
my
love
and
about
all
my
plans
for
my
future
connubial
happiness
strangely
enough
no
sooner
had
i
related
in
detail
the
whole
strength
of
my
feelings
than
i
instantly
became
conscious
of
its
diminution
the
rain
overtook
us
just
as
we
were
turning
into
the
avenue
of
which
led
to
the
house
but
it
did
not
really
wet
us
i
only
knew
that
it
was
raining
by
the
fact
that
i
felt
a
drop
fall
first
on
my
nose
and
then
on
my
hand
and
heard
something
begin
to
patter
upon
the
young
viscous
leaves
of
the
as
drooping
their
curly
branches
overhead
they
seemed
to
imbibe
the
pure
shining
drops
with
an
avidity
which
filled
the
whole
avenue
with
scent
we
descended
from
the
carriage
so
as
to
reach
the
house
the
quicker
through
the
garden
but
found
ourselves
confronted
at
the
by
four
ladies
two
of
whom
were
knitting
one
reading
a
book
and
the
fourth
walking
to
and
fro
with
a
little
dog
thereupon
dimitri
began
to
present
me
to
his
mother
sister
and
aunt
as
well
as
to
lubov
sergievna
for
a
moment
they
remained
where
they
were
but
almost
instantly
the
rain
became
heavier
let
us
go
into
the
verandah
you
can
present
him
to
us
there
said
the
lady
whom
i
took
to
be
dimitri
s
mother
and
we
all
of
us
ascended
the
xxiii
the
nechludoffs
from
the
first
the
member
of
this
company
who
struck
me
the
most
was
lubov
sergievna
who
holding
a
lapdog
in
her
arms
and
wearing
stout
laced
boots
was
the
last
of
the
four
ladies
to
ascend
the
staircase
and
twice
stopped
to
gaze
at
me
intently
and
then
kiss
her
little
dog
she
was
anything
but
since
she
was
thin
short
and
slightly
crooked
what
made
her
plain
face
all
the
plainer
was
the
queer
way
in
which
her
hair
was
parted
to
one
side
it
looked
like
the
wigs
which
bald
women
contrive
for
themselves
however
much
i
should
have
liked
to
applaud
my
friend
i
could
not
find
a
single
comely
feature
in
her
even
her
brown
eyes
though
expressive
of
were
small
and
dull
were
in
fact
anything
but
pretty
while
her
hands
those
most
characteristic
of
features
were
though
neither
large
nor
coarse
and
red
as
soon
as
we
reached
the
verandah
each
of
the
ladies
except
dimitri
s
sister
varenika
who
also
had
been
regarding
me
attentively
out
of
her
large
eyes
said
a
few
words
to
me
before
resuming
her
occupation
while
varenika
herself
began
to
read
aloud
from
a
book
which
she
held
on
her
lap
and
steadied
with
her
finger
the
princess
maria
ivanovna
was
a
tall
woman
of
forty
to
judge
by
the
curls
of
hair
which
descended
below
her
cap
one
might
have
taken
her
for
more
but
as
soon
as
ever
one
observed
the
fresh
extraordinarily
tender
and
almost
wrinkleless
face
as
well
as
most
of
all
the
lively
cheerful
sparkle
of
the
large
eyes
one
involuntarily
took
her
for
less
her
eyes
were
black
and
very
frank
her
lips
thin
and
slightly
severe
her
nose
regular
and
slightly
inclined
to
the
left
and
her
hands
ringless
large
and
almost
like
those
of
a
man
but
with
finely
tapering
fingers
she
wore
a
dress
fastened
to
the
throat
and
sitting
closely
to
her
firm
still
youthful
waist
a
waist
which
she
evidently
pinched
lastly
she
held
herself
very
upright
and
was
knitting
a
garment
of
some
kind
as
soon
as
i
stepped
on
to
the
verandah
she
took
me
by
the
hand
drew
me
to
her
as
though
wishing
to
scrutinise
me
more
closely
and
said
as
she
gazed
at
me
with
the
same
cold
candid
glance
as
her
son
s
that
she
had
long
known
me
by
report
from
dimitri
and
that
therefore
in
order
to
make
my
acquaintance
thoroughly
she
had
invited
me
to
stay
these
hours
in
her
house
do
just
as
you
please
here
she
said
and
stand
on
no
ceremony
whatever
with
us
even
as
we
shall
stand
on
none
with
you
pray
walk
read
listen
or
sleep
as
the
mood
may
take
sophia
ivanovna
was
an
old
maid
and
the
princess
s
younger
sister
though
she
looked
the
elder
of
the
two
she
had
that
exceedingly
overstuffed
appearance
which
old
maids
always
present
who
are
short
of
stature
but
wear
corsets
it
seemed
as
though
her
healthiness
had
shifted
upwards
to
the
point
of
choking
her
her
short
fat
hands
would
not
meet
below
her
projecting
bust
and
the
line
of
her
waist
was
scarcely
visible
at
all
notwithstanding
that
the
princess
maria
ivanovna
had
black
hair
and
eyes
while
sophia
ivanovna
had
white
hair
and
large
vivacious
tranquilly
blue
eyes
a
rare
combination
there
was
a
great
likeness
between
the
two
sisters
for
they
had
the
same
expression
nose
and
lips
the
only
difference
was
that
sophia
s
nose
and
lips
were
a
trifle
coarser
than
maria
s
and
that
when
she
smiled
those
features
inclined
towards
the
right
whereas
maria
s
inclined
towards
the
left
sophia
to
judge
by
her
dress
and
coiffure
was
still
youthful
at
heart
and
would
never
have
displayed
grey
curls
even
if
she
had
possessed
them
yet
at
first
her
glance
and
bearing
towards
me
seemed
very
proud
and
made
me
nervous
whereas
i
at
once
felt
at
home
with
the
princess
perhaps
it
was
only
sophia
s
stoutness
and
a
certain
resemblance
to
portraits
of
catherine
the
great
that
gave
her
in
my
eyes
a
haughty
aspect
but
at
all
events
i
felt
quite
intimidated
when
she
looked
at
me
intently
and
said
friends
of
our
friends
are
our
friends
i
became
reassured
and
changed
my
opinion
about
her
only
when
after
saying
those
words
she
opened
her
mouth
and
sighed
deeply
it
may
be
that
she
owed
her
habit
of
sighing
after
every
few
words
with
a
great
distention
of
the
mouth
and
a
slight
drooping
of
her
large
blue
eyes
to
her
stoutness
yet
it
was
none
the
less
one
which
expressed
so
much
that
i
at
once
lost
all
fear
of
her
and
found
her
actually
attractive
her
eyes
were
charming
her
voice
pleasant
and
musical
and
even
the
flowing
lines
of
her
fullness
seemed
to
my
youthful
vision
not
wholly
lacking
in
beauty
i
had
imagined
that
lubov
sergievna
as
my
friend
s
friend
would
at
once
say
something
friendly
and
familiar
to
me
yet
after
gazing
at
me
fixedly
for
a
while
as
though
in
doubt
whether
the
remark
she
was
about
to
make
to
me
would
not
be
too
friendly
she
at
length
asked
me
what
faculty
i
was
in
after
that
she
stared
at
me
as
before
in
evident
hesitation
as
to
whether
or
not
to
say
something
civil
and
familiar
until
remarking
her
perplexity
i
besought
her
with
a
look
to
speak
freely
yet
all
she
then
said
was
they
tell
me
the
universities
pay
very
little
attention
to
science
now
and
turned
away
to
call
her
little
dog
all
that
evening
she
spoke
only
in
disjointed
fragments
of
this
kind
fragments
which
had
no
connection
either
with
the
point
or
with
one
another
yet
i
had
such
faith
in
dimitri
and
he
so
often
kept
looking
from
her
to
me
with
an
expression
which
mutely
asked
me
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
that
though
i
entirely
failed
to
persuade
myself
that
in
lubov
sergievna
there
was
anything
to
speak
of
i
could
not
bear
to
express
the
thought
even
to
myself
as
for
the
last
member
of
the
family
varenika
she
was
a
girl
of
sixteen
the
only
good
features
in
her
were
a
pair
of
eyes
which
in
their
expression
of
gaiety
mingled
with
quiet
attention
greatly
resembled
those
of
her
aunt
a
long
coil
of
flaxen
hair
and
extremely
delicate
beautiful
hands
i
expect
monsieur
nicolas
you
find
it
wearisome
to
hear
a
story
begun
from
the
middle
said
sophia
ivanovna
with
her
sigh
as
she
turned
over
some
pieces
of
clothing
which
she
was
sewing
the
reading
aloud
had
ceased
for
the
moment
because
dimitri
had
left
the
room
on
some
errand
or
another
or
perhaps
you
have
read
rob
roy
before
she
added
at
that
period
i
thought
it
incumbent
upon
me
in
virtue
of
my
student
s
uniform
to
reply
in
a
very
clever
and
original
manner
to
every
question
put
to
me
by
people
whom
i
did
not
know
very
well
and
regarded
such
short
clear
answers
as
yes
no
i
like
it
or
i
do
not
care
for
it
as
things
to
be
ashamed
of
accordingly
looking
down
at
my
new
and
trousers
and
the
glittering
buttons
of
my
tunic
i
replied
that
i
had
never
read
rob
roy
but
that
it
interested
me
greatly
to
hear
it
since
i
preferred
to
read
books
from
the
middle
rather
than
from
the
beginning
it
is
twice
as
interesting
i
added
with
a
smirk
for
then
one
can
guess
what
has
gone
before
as
well
as
what
is
to
come
the
princess
smiled
what
i
thought
was
a
forced
smile
but
one
which
i
discovered
later
to
be
her
only
one
well
perhaps
that
is
true
she
said
but
tell
me
nicolas
you
will
not
be
offended
if
i
drop
the
monsieur
tell
me
are
you
going
to
be
in
town
long
when
do
you
go
away
i
do
not
know
quite
perhaps
or
perhaps
not
for
some
while
yet
i
replied
for
some
reason
or
another
though
i
knew
perfectly
well
that
in
reality
we
were
to
go
i
wish
you
could
stop
longer
both
for
your
own
sake
and
for
dimitri
s
she
said
in
a
meditative
manner
at
your
age
friendship
is
a
weak
i
felt
that
every
one
was
looking
at
me
and
waiting
to
see
what
i
should
say
though
certainly
varenika
made
a
pretence
of
looking
at
her
aunt
s
work
i
felt
in
fact
as
though
i
were
being
put
through
an
examination
and
that
it
behoved
me
to
figure
in
it
as
well
as
possible
yes
to
me
dimitri
s
friendship
is
most
useful
i
replied
but
to
him
mine
can
not
be
of
any
use
at
all
since
he
is
a
thousand
times
better
than
dimitri
could
not
hear
what
i
said
or
i
should
have
feared
his
detecting
the
insincerity
of
my
words
again
the
princess
smiled
her
unnatural
yet
characteristically
natural
smile
just
listen
to
him
she
said
but
it
is
you
who
are
the
little
monster
of
monster
of
perfection
i
thought
to
myself
that
is
splendid
i
must
make
a
note
of
yet
to
dismiss
yourself
he
has
been
extraordinarily
clever
in
that
quarter
she
went
on
in
a
lower
tone
which
pleased
me
somehow
as
she
indicated
lubov
sergievna
with
her
eyes
since
he
has
discovered
in
our
poor
little
auntie
such
was
the
pet
name
which
they
gave
lubov
all
sorts
of
perfections
which
i
who
have
known
her
and
her
little
dog
for
twenty
years
had
never
yet
suspected
varenika
go
and
tell
them
to
bring
me
a
glass
of
water
she
added
letting
her
eyes
wander
again
probably
she
had
bethought
her
that
it
was
too
soon
or
not
entirely
necessary
to
let
me
into
all
the
family
secrets
yet
no
let
him
go
for
he
has
nothing
to
do
while
you
are
reading
pray
go
to
the
door
my
friend
she
said
to
me
and
walk
about
fifteen
steps
down
the
passage
then
halt
and
call
out
pretty
loudly
peter
bring
maria
ivanovna
a
glass
of
iced
water
and
she
smiled
her
curious
smile
once
more
i
expect
she
wants
to
say
something
about
me
in
my
absence
i
thought
to
myself
as
i
left
the
room
i
expect
she
wants
to
remark
that
she
can
see
very
clearly
that
i
am
a
very
very
clever
young
hardly
had
i
taken
a
dozen
steps
when
i
was
overtaken
by
sophia
ivanovna
who
though
fat
and
short
of
breath
trod
with
surprising
lightness
and
agility
merci
mon
cher
she
said
i
will
go
and
tell
them
xxiv
love
sophia
ivanovna
as
i
afterwards
came
to
know
her
was
one
of
those
rare
women
who
are
born
for
family
life
but
to
whom
that
happiness
has
been
denied
by
fate
consequently
all
that
store
of
their
love
which
should
have
been
poured
out
upon
a
husband
and
children
becomes
pent
up
in
their
hearts
until
they
suddenly
decide
to
let
it
overflow
upon
a
few
chosen
individuals
yet
so
inexhaustible
is
that
store
of
old
maids
love
that
despite
the
number
of
individuals
so
selected
there
still
remains
an
abundant
surplus
of
affection
which
they
lavish
upon
all
by
whom
they
are
surrounded
upon
all
good
or
bad
whom
they
may
chance
to
meet
in
their
daily
life
of
love
there
are
three
kinds
love
of
beauty
the
love
which
denies
itself
and
practical
love
of
the
desire
of
a
young
man
for
a
young
woman
as
well
as
of
the
reverse
instance
i
am
not
now
speaking
for
of
such
tendresses
i
am
wary
seeing
that
i
have
been
too
unhappy
in
my
life
to
have
been
able
ever
to
see
in
such
affection
a
single
spark
of
truth
but
rather
a
lying
pretence
in
which
sensuality
connubial
relations
money
and
the
wish
to
bind
hands
or
to
unloose
them
have
rendered
feeling
such
a
complex
affair
as
to
defy
analysis
rather
am
i
speaking
of
that
love
for
a
human
being
which
according
to
the
spiritual
strength
of
its
possessor
concentrates
itself
either
upon
a
single
individual
upon
a
few
or
upon
many
of
love
for
a
mother
a
father
a
brother
little
children
a
friend
a
compatriot
of
love
in
short
for
one
s
neighbour
love
of
beauty
consists
in
a
love
of
the
sense
of
beauty
and
of
its
expression
people
who
thus
love
conceive
the
object
of
their
affection
to
be
desirable
only
in
so
far
as
it
arouses
in
them
that
pleasurable
sensation
of
which
the
consciousness
and
the
expression
soothes
the
senses
they
change
the
object
of
their
love
frequently
since
their
principal
aim
consists
in
ensuring
that
the
voluptuous
feeling
of
their
adoration
shall
be
constantly
titillated
to
preserve
in
themselves
this
sensuous
condition
they
talk
unceasingly
and
in
the
most
elegant
terms
on
the
subject
of
the
love
which
they
feel
not
only
for
its
immediate
object
but
also
for
objects
upon
which
it
does
not
touch
at
all
this
country
of
ours
contains
many
such
individuals
individuals
of
that
class
who
cultivating
the
beautiful
not
only
discourse
of
their
cult
to
all
and
sundry
but
speak
of
it
in
french
it
may
seem
a
strange
and
ridiculous
thing
to
say
but
i
am
convinced
that
among
us
we
have
had
in
the
past
and
still
have
a
large
section
of
society
notably
women
whose
love
for
their
friends
husbands
or
children
would
expire
if
they
were
debarred
from
dilating
upon
it
in
the
tongue
of
france
love
of
the
second
kind
renunciatory
love
consists
in
a
yearning
to
undergo
for
the
object
beloved
regardless
of
any
consideration
whether
such
will
benefit
or
injure
the
object
in
question
there
is
no
evil
which
i
would
not
endure
to
show
both
the
world
and
him
or
her
whom
i
adore
my
there
we
have
the
formula
of
this
kind
of
love
people
who
thus
love
never
look
for
reciprocity
of
affection
since
it
is
a
finer
thing
to
sacrifice
yourself
for
one
who
does
not
comprehend
you
also
they
are
always
painfully
eager
to
exaggerate
the
merits
of
their
sacrifice
usually
constant
in
their
love
for
the
reason
that
they
would
find
it
hard
to
forego
the
kudos
of
the
deprivations
which
they
endure
for
the
object
beloved
always
ready
to
die
to
prove
to
him
or
to
her
the
entirety
of
their
devotion
but
sparing
of
such
small
daily
proofs
of
their
love
as
call
for
no
special
effort
of
they
do
not
much
care
whether
you
eat
well
sleep
well
keep
your
spirits
up
or
enjoy
good
health
nor
do
they
ever
do
anything
to
obtain
for
you
those
blessings
if
they
have
it
in
their
power
but
should
you
be
confronting
a
bullet
or
have
fallen
into
the
water
or
stand
in
danger
of
being
burnt
or
have
had
your
heart
broken
in
a
love
affair
well
for
all
these
things
they
are
prepared
if
the
occasion
should
arise
moreover
people
addicted
to
love
of
such
a
order
are
invariably
proud
of
their
love
exacting
jealous
distrustful
and
strange
to
tell
anxious
that
the
object
of
their
adoration
should
incur
perils
so
that
they
may
save
it
from
calamity
and
console
it
thereafter
and
even
be
vicious
so
that
they
may
purge
it
of
its
vice
suppose
now
that
you
are
living
in
the
country
with
a
wife
who
loves
you
in
this
manner
you
may
be
healthy
and
contented
and
have
occupations
which
interest
you
while
on
the
other
hand
your
wife
may
be
too
weak
to
superintend
the
household
work
which
in
consequence
will
be
left
to
the
servants
or
to
look
after
the
children
who
in
consequence
will
be
left
to
the
nurses
or
to
put
her
heart
into
any
work
whatsoever
and
all
because
she
loves
nobody
and
nothing
but
yourself
she
may
be
patently
ill
yet
she
will
say
not
a
word
to
you
about
it
for
fear
of
distressing
you
she
may
be
patently
ennuyee
yet
for
your
sake
she
will
be
prepared
to
be
so
for
the
rest
of
her
life
she
may
be
patently
depressed
because
you
stick
so
persistently
to
your
occupations
whether
sport
books
farming
state
service
or
anything
else
and
see
clearly
that
they
are
doing
you
harm
yet
for
all
that
she
will
keep
silence
and
suffer
it
to
be
so
yet
should
you
but
fall
sick
and
despite
her
own
ailments
and
your
prayers
that
she
will
not
distress
herself
in
vain
your
loving
wife
will
remain
sitting
inseparably
by
your
bedside
every
moment
you
will
feel
her
sympathetic
gaze
resting
upon
you
and
as
it
were
saying
there
i
told
you
so
but
it
is
all
one
to
me
and
i
shall
not
leave
in
the
morning
you
maybe
a
little
better
and
move
into
another
room
the
room
however
will
be
insufficiently
warmed
or
set
in
order
the
soup
which
alone
you
feel
you
could
eat
will
not
have
been
cooked
nor
will
any
medicine
have
been
sent
for
yet
though
worn
out
with
night
watching
your
loving
wife
will
continue
to
regard
you
with
an
expression
of
sympathy
to
walk
about
on
tiptoe
and
to
whisper
unaccustomed
and
obscure
orders
to
the
servants
you
may
wish
to
be
read
to
and
your
loving
wife
will
tell
you
with
a
sigh
that
she
feels
sure
you
will
be
unable
to
hear
her
reading
and
only
grow
angry
at
her
awkwardness
in
doing
it
wherefore
you
had
better
not
be
read
to
at
all
you
may
wish
to
walk
about
the
room
and
she
will
tell
you
that
it
would
be
far
better
for
you
not
to
do
so
you
may
wish
to
talk
with
some
friends
who
have
called
and
she
will
tell
you
that
talking
is
not
good
for
you
at
nightfall
the
fever
may
come
upon
you
again
and
you
may
wish
to
be
left
alone
whereupon
your
loving
wife
though
wasted
pale
and
full
of
yawns
will
go
on
sitting
in
a
chair
opposite
you
as
dusk
falls
until
her
very
slightest
movement
her
very
slightest
sound
rouses
you
to
feelings
of
anger
and
impatience
you
may
have
a
servant
who
has
lived
with
you
for
twenty
years
and
to
whom
you
are
attached
and
who
would
tend
you
well
and
to
your
satisfaction
during
the
night
for
the
reason
that
he
has
been
asleep
all
day
and
is
moreover
paid
a
salary
for
his
services
yet
your
wife
will
not
suffer
him
to
wait
upon
you
no
everything
she
must
do
herself
with
her
weak
unaccustomed
fingers
of
which
you
follow
the
movements
with
suppressed
irritation
as
those
pale
members
do
their
best
to
uncork
a
medicine
bottle
to
snuff
a
candle
to
pour
out
physic
or
to
touch
you
in
a
squeamish
sort
of
way
if
you
are
an
impatient
hasty
sort
of
man
and
beg
of
her
to
leave
the
room
you
will
hear
by
the
vexed
distressed
sounds
which
come
from
her
that
she
is
humbly
sobbing
and
weeping
behind
the
door
and
whispering
foolishness
of
some
kind
to
the
servant
finally
if
you
do
not
die
your
loving
wife
who
has
not
slept
during
the
whole
three
weeks
of
your
illness
a
fact
of
which
she
will
constantly
remind
you
will
fall
ill
in
her
turn
waste
away
suffer
much
and
become
even
more
incapable
of
any
useful
pursuit
than
she
was
before
while
by
the
time
that
you
have
regained
your
normal
state
of
health
she
will
express
to
you
her
affection
only
by
shedding
around
you
a
kind
of
benignant
dullness
which
involuntarily
communicates
itself
both
to
yourself
and
to
every
one
else
in
your
vicinity
the
third
kind
of
love
practical
love
consists
of
a
yearning
to
satisfy
every
need
every
desire
every
caprice
nay
every
vice
of
the
being
beloved
people
who
love
thus
always
love
their
life
long
since
the
more
they
love
the
more
they
get
to
know
the
object
beloved
and
the
easier
they
find
the
task
of
loving
it
that
is
to
say
of
satisfying
its
desires
their
love
seldom
finds
expression
in
words
but
if
it
does
so
it
expresses
itself
neither
with
assurance
nor
beauty
but
rather
in
a
shamefaced
awkward
manner
since
people
of
this
kind
invariably
have
misgivings
that
they
are
loving
unworthily
people
of
this
kind
love
even
the
faults
of
their
adored
one
for
the
reason
that
those
faults
afford
them
the
power
of
constantly
satisfying
new
desires
they
look
for
their
affection
to
be
returned
and
even
deceive
themselves
into
believing
that
it
is
returned
and
are
happy
accordingly
yet
in
the
reverse
case
they
will
still
continue
to
desire
happiness
for
their
beloved
one
and
try
by
every
means
in
their
power
whether
moral
or
material
great
or
small
to
provide
it
such
practical
love
it
was
love
for
her
nephew
for
her
niece
for
her
sister
for
lubov
sergievna
and
even
for
myself
because
i
loved
dimitri
that
shone
in
the
eyes
as
well
as
in
the
every
word
and
movement
of
sophia
ivanovna
only
long
afterwards
did
i
learn
to
value
her
at
her
true
worth
yet
even
now
the
question
occurred
to
me
what
has
made
dimitri
who
throughout
has
tried
to
understand
love
differently
to
other
young
fellows
and
has
always
had
before
his
eyes
the
gentle
loving
sophia
ivanovna
suddenly
fall
so
deeply
in
love
with
the
incomprehensible
lubov
sergievna
and
declare
that
in
his
aunt
he
can
only
find
good
qualities
verily
it
is
a
true
saying
that
a
prophet
hath
no
honour
in
his
own
one
of
two
things
either
every
man
has
in
him
more
of
bad
than
of
good
or
every
man
is
more
receptive
to
bad
than
to
good
lubov
sergievna
he
has
not
known
for
long
whereas
his
aunt
s
love
he
has
known
since
the
day
of
his
xxv
i
become
better
acquainted
with
the
nechludoffs
when
i
returned
to
the
verandah
i
found
that
they
were
not
talking
of
me
at
all
as
i
had
anticipated
on
the
contrary
varenika
had
laid
aside
the
book
and
was
engaged
in
a
heated
dispute
with
dimitri
who
for
his
part
was
walking
up
and
down
the
verandah
and
frowningly
adjusting
his
neck
in
his
collar
as
he
did
so
the
subject
of
the
quarrel
seemed
to
be
ivan
yakovlevitch
and
superstition
but
it
was
too
animated
a
difference
for
its
underlying
cause
not
to
be
something
which
concerned
the
family
much
more
nearly
although
the
princess
and
lubov
sergievna
were
sitting
by
in
silence
they
were
following
every
word
and
evidently
tempted
at
times
to
take
part
in
the
dispute
yet
always
just
when
they
were
about
to
speak
they
checked
themselves
and
left
the
field
clear
for
the
two
principles
dimitri
and
varenika
on
my
entry
the
latter
glanced
at
me
with
such
an
indifferent
air
that
i
could
see
she
was
wholly
absorbed
in
the
quarrel
and
did
not
care
whether
she
spoke
in
my
presence
or
not
the
princess
too
looked
the
same
and
was
clearly
on
varenika
s
side
while
dimitri
began
if
anything
to
raise
his
voice
still
more
when
i
appeared
and
lubov
sergievna
for
her
part
observed
to
no
one
in
particular
old
people
are
quite
right
when
they
say
si
jeunesse
savait
si
vieillesse
nevertheless
this
quotation
did
not
check
the
dispute
though
it
somehow
gave
me
the
impression
that
the
side
represented
by
the
speaker
and
her
friend
was
in
the
wrong
although
it
was
a
little
awkward
for
me
to
be
present
at
a
petty
family
difference
the
fact
that
the
true
relations
of
the
family
revealed
themselves
during
its
progress
and
that
my
presence
did
nothing
to
hinder
that
revelation
afforded
me
considerable
gratification
how
often
it
happens
that
for
years
one
sees
a
family
cover
themselves
over
with
a
conventional
cloak
of
decorum
and
preserve
the
real
relations
of
its
members
a
secret
from
every
eye
how
often
too
have
i
remarked
that
the
more
impenetrable
and
therefore
the
more
decorous
is
the
cloak
the
harsher
are
the
relations
which
it
conceals
yet
once
let
some
unexpected
question
often
a
most
trivial
one
the
colour
of
a
woman
s
hair
a
visit
a
man
s
horses
and
so
forth
arise
in
that
family
circle
and
without
any
visible
cause
there
will
also
arise
an
difference
until
in
time
the
cloak
of
decorum
becomes
unequal
to
confining
the
quarrel
within
due
bounds
and
to
the
dismay
of
the
disputants
and
the
astonishment
of
the
auditors
the
real
and
relations
of
the
family
are
laid
bare
and
the
cloak
now
useless
for
concealment
is
bandied
from
hand
to
hand
among
the
contending
factions
until
it
serves
only
to
remind
one
of
the
years
during
which
it
successfully
deceived
one
s
perceptions
sometimes
to
strike
one
s
head
violently
against
a
ceiling
hurts
one
less
than
just
to
graze
some
spot
which
has
been
hurt
and
bruised
before
and
in
almost
every
family
there
exists
some
such
raw
and
tender
spot
in
the
nechludoff
family
that
spot
was
dimitri
s
extraordinary
affection
for
lubov
sergievna
which
aroused
in
the
mother
and
sister
if
not
a
jealous
feeling
at
all
events
a
sense
of
hurt
family
pride
this
was
the
grave
significance
which
underlay
for
all
those
present
the
seeming
dispute
about
ivan
yakovlevitch
and
superstition
in
anything
that
other
people
deride
and
despise
you
invariably
profess
to
see
something
extraordinarily
good
varenika
was
saying
in
her
clear
voice
as
she
articulated
each
syllable
with
careful
precision
indeed
retorted
dimitri
with
an
impatient
toss
of
his
head
now
in
the
first
place
only
a
most
unthinking
person
could
ever
speak
of
despising
such
a
remarkable
man
as
ivan
yakovlevitch
while
in
the
second
place
it
is
you
who
invariably
profess
to
see
nothing
good
in
what
confronts
meanwhile
sophia
ivanovna
kept
looking
anxiously
at
us
as
she
turned
first
to
her
nephew
and
then
to
her
niece
and
then
to
myself
twice
she
opened
her
mouth
as
though
to
say
what
was
in
her
mind
and
drew
a
deep
sigh
varia
please
go
on
reading
she
said
at
length
at
the
same
time
handing
her
niece
the
book
and
patting
her
hand
kindly
i
wish
to
know
whether
he
ever
found
her
again
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
novel
in
question
contained
not
a
word
about
any
one
finding
any
one
else
and
mitia
dear
she
added
to
her
nephew
despite
the
glum
looks
which
he
was
throwing
at
her
for
having
interrupted
the
logical
thread
of
his
deductions
you
had
better
let
me
poultice
your
cheek
or
your
teeth
will
begin
to
ache
after
that
the
reading
was
resumed
yet
the
quarrel
had
in
no
way
dispelled
the
calm
atmosphere
of
family
and
intellectual
harmony
which
enveloped
this
circle
of
ladies
clearly
deriving
its
inspiration
and
character
from
the
princess
maria
ivanovna
it
was
a
circle
which
for
me
had
a
wholly
novel
and
attractive
character
of
logicalness
mingled
with
simplicity
and
refinement
that
character
i
could
discern
in
the
daintiness
good
taste
and
solidity
of
everything
about
me
whether
the
handbell
the
binding
of
the
book
the
settee
or
the
table
likewise
i
divined
it
in
the
upright
pose
of
the
princess
in
her
pendant
curls
of
grey
hair
in
the
manner
in
which
she
had
at
our
first
introduction
called
me
plain
nicolas
and
he
in
the
occupations
of
the
ladies
the
reading
and
the
sewing
of
garments
and
in
the
unusual
whiteness
of
their
hands
those
hands
en
passant
showed
a
family
feature
common
to
all
namely
the
feature
that
the
flesh
of
the
palm
on
the
outer
side
was
rosy
in
colour
and
divided
by
a
sharp
straight
line
from
the
pure
whiteness
of
the
upper
portion
of
the
hand
still
more
was
the
character
of
this
feminine
circle
expressed
in
the
manner
in
which
the
three
ladies
spoke
russian
and
french
spoke
them
that
is
to
say
with
perfect
articulation
of
syllables
and
pedantic
accuracy
of
substantives
and
prepositions
all
this
and
more
especially
the
fact
that
the
ladies
treated
me
as
simply
and
as
seriously
as
a
real
telling
me
their
opinions
and
listening
to
my
own
a
thing
to
which
i
was
so
little
accustomed
that
for
all
my
glittering
buttons
and
blue
facings
i
was
in
constant
fear
of
being
told
surely
you
do
not
think
that
we
are
talking
seriously
to
you
go
away
and
learn
something
all
this
i
say
caused
me
to
feel
an
entire
absence
of
restraint
in
this
society
i
ventured
at
times
to
rise
to
move
about
and
to
talk
boldly
to
each
of
the
ladies
except
varenika
whom
i
always
felt
it
was
unbecoming
or
even
forbidden
for
me
to
address
unless
she
first
spoke
to
me
as
i
listened
to
her
clear
pleasant
voice
reading
aloud
i
kept
glancing
from
her
to
the
path
of
the
where
the
were
making
small
dark
circles
in
the
sand
and
thence
to
the
upon
the
leaves
of
which
the
rain
was
pattering
down
in
large
detached
drops
shed
from
the
pale
shimmering
edge
of
the
livid
blue
cloud
which
hung
suspended
over
us
then
i
would
glance
at
her
again
and
then
at
the
last
purple
rays
of
the
setting
sun
where
they
were
throwing
the
dense
clusters
of
old
birches
into
brilliant
relief
yet
again
my
eyes
would
return
to
varenika
and
each
time
that
they
did
so
it
struck
me
afresh
that
she
was
not
nearly
so
plain
as
at
first
i
had
thought
her
how
i
wish
that
i
wasn
t
in
love
already
i
reflected
or
that
sonetchka
was
varenika
how
nice
it
would
be
if
suddenly
i
could
become
a
member
of
this
family
and
have
the
three
ladies
for
my
mother
aunt
and
wife
respectively
all
the
time
that
these
thoughts
kept
passing
through
my
head
i
kept
attentively
regarding
varenika
as
she
read
until
somehow
i
felt
as
though
i
were
magnetising
her
and
that
presently
she
must
look
at
me
sure
enough
at
length
she
raised
her
head
threw
me
a
glance
and
meeting
my
eyes
turned
away
the
rain
does
not
seem
to
stop
she
remarked
suddenly
a
new
feeling
came
over
me
i
began
to
feel
as
though
everything
now
happening
to
me
was
a
repetition
of
some
similar
occurrence
before
as
though
on
some
previous
occasion
a
shower
of
rain
had
begun
to
fall
and
the
sun
had
set
behind
and
i
had
been
looking
at
her
and
she
had
been
reading
aloud
and
i
had
magnetised
her
and
she
had
looked
up
at
me
yes
all
this
i
seemed
to
recall
as
though
it
had
happened
once
before
surely
she
is
not
she
was
my
thought
surely
it
is
not
beginning
however
i
soon
decided
that
varenika
was
not
the
she
referred
to
and
that
it
was
not
in
the
first
place
i
said
to
myself
varenika
is
not
at
all
beautiful
she
is
just
an
ordinary
girl
whose
acquaintance
i
have
made
in
the
ordinary
way
whereas
the
she
whom
i
shall
meet
somewhere
and
some
day
and
in
some
not
ordinary
way
will
be
anything
but
ordinary
this
family
pleases
me
so
much
only
because
hitherto
i
have
never
seen
anybody
such
things
will
always
be
happening
in
the
future
and
i
shall
see
many
more
such
families
during
my
xxvi
i
show
off
at
tea
time
the
reading
came
to
an
end
and
the
ladies
began
to
talk
among
themselves
of
persons
and
things
unknown
to
me
this
i
conceived
them
to
be
doing
on
purpose
to
make
me
conscious
for
all
their
kind
demeanour
of
the
difference
which
years
and
position
in
the
world
had
set
between
them
and
myself
in
general
discussions
however
in
which
i
could
take
part
i
sought
to
atone
for
my
late
silence
by
exhibiting
that
extraordinary
cleverness
and
originality
to
which
i
felt
compelled
by
my
university
uniform
for
instance
when
the
conversation
turned
upon
country
houses
i
said
that
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
had
a
villa
near
moscow
which
people
came
to
see
even
from
london
and
paris
and
that
it
contained
balustrading
which
had
cost
roubles
likewise
i
remarked
that
the
prince
was
a
very
near
relation
of
mine
and
that
when
lunching
with
him
the
same
day
he
had
invited
me
to
go
and
spend
the
entire
summer
with
him
at
that
villa
but
that
i
had
declined
since
i
knew
the
villa
well
and
had
stayed
in
it
more
than
once
and
that
all
those
balustradings
and
bridges
did
not
interest
me
since
i
could
not
bear
ornamental
work
especially
in
the
country
where
i
liked
everything
to
be
wholly
countrified
after
delivering
myself
of
this
extraordinary
and
complicated
romance
i
grew
confused
and
blushed
so
much
that
every
one
must
have
seen
that
i
was
lying
both
varenika
who
was
handing
me
a
cup
of
tea
and
sophia
ivanovna
who
had
been
gazing
at
me
throughout
turned
their
heads
away
and
began
to
talk
of
something
else
with
an
expression
which
i
afterwards
learnt
that
people
assume
when
a
very
young
man
has
told
them
a
manifest
string
of
lies
an
expression
which
says
yes
we
know
he
is
lying
and
why
he
is
doing
it
the
poor
young
fellow
what
i
had
said
about
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
having
a
country
villa
i
had
related
simply
because
i
could
find
no
other
pretext
for
mentioning
both
my
relationship
to
the
prince
and
the
fact
that
i
had
been
to
luncheon
with
him
that
day
yet
why
i
had
said
all
i
had
about
the
balustrading
costing
roubles
and
about
my
having
several
times
visited
the
prince
at
that
villa
i
had
never
once
been
there
more
especially
since
the
prince
possessed
no
residences
save
in
moscow
and
naples
as
the
nechludoffs
very
well
knew
i
could
not
possibly
tell
you
neither
in
childhood
nor
in
adolescence
nor
in
riper
years
did
i
ever
remark
in
myself
the
vice
of
falsehood
on
the
contrary
i
was
if
anything
too
outspoken
and
truthful
yet
during
this
first
stage
of
my
manhood
i
often
found
myself
seized
with
a
strange
and
unreasonable
tendency
to
lie
in
the
most
desperate
fashion
i
say
advisedly
in
the
most
desperate
fashion
for
the
reason
that
i
lied
in
matters
in
which
it
was
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
detect
me
on
the
whole
i
think
that
a
desire
to
appear
different
from
what
i
was
combined
with
an
impossible
hope
that
the
lie
would
never
be
found
out
was
the
chief
cause
of
this
extraordinary
impulse
after
tea
since
the
rain
had
stopped
and
the
of
sunset
was
calm
and
clear
the
princess
proposed
that
we
should
go
and
stroll
in
the
lower
garden
and
admire
her
favourite
spots
there
following
my
rule
to
be
always
original
and
conceiving
that
clever
people
like
myself
and
the
princess
must
surely
be
above
the
banalities
of
politeness
i
replied
that
i
could
not
bear
a
walk
with
no
object
in
view
and
that
if
i
did
walk
i
liked
to
walk
alone
i
had
no
idea
that
this
speech
was
simply
rude
all
i
thought
was
that
even
as
nothing
could
be
more
futile
than
empty
compliments
so
nothing
could
be
more
pleasing
and
original
than
a
little
frank
brusquerie
however
though
much
pleased
with
my
answer
i
set
out
with
the
rest
of
the
company
the
princess
s
favourite
spot
of
all
was
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
lower
garden
where
a
little
bridge
spanned
a
narrow
piece
of
swamp
the
view
there
was
very
restricted
yet
very
intimate
and
pleasing
we
are
so
accustomed
to
confound
art
with
nature
that
often
enough
phenomena
of
nature
which
are
never
to
be
met
with
in
pictures
seem
to
us
unreal
and
give
us
the
impression
that
nature
is
unnatural
or
vice
versa
whereas
phenomena
of
nature
which
occur
with
too
much
frequency
in
pictures
seem
to
us
hackneyed
and
views
which
are
to
be
met
with
in
real
life
but
which
appear
to
us
too
penetrated
with
a
single
idea
or
a
single
sentiment
seem
to
us
arabesques
the
view
from
the
princess
s
favourite
spot
was
as
follows
on
the
further
side
of
a
small
lake
with
weeds
round
its
edges
rose
a
steep
ascent
covered
with
bushes
and
with
huge
old
trees
of
many
shades
of
green
while
overhanging
the
lake
at
the
foot
of
the
ascent
stood
an
ancient
birch
tree
which
though
partly
supported
by
stout
roots
implanted
in
the
marshy
bank
of
the
lake
rested
its
crown
upon
a
tall
straight
poplar
and
dangled
its
curved
branches
over
the
smooth
surface
of
the
pond
both
branches
and
the
surrounding
greenery
being
reflected
therein
as
in
a
mirror
how
lovely
said
the
princess
with
a
nod
of
her
head
and
addressing
no
one
in
particular
yes
marvellous
i
replied
in
my
desire
to
show
that
had
an
opinion
of
my
own
on
every
subject
yet
somehow
it
all
looks
to
me
so
terribly
like
a
scheme
of
the
princess
went
on
gazing
at
the
scene
as
though
she
had
not
heard
me
and
turning
to
her
sister
and
lubov
sergievna
at
intervals
in
order
to
point
out
to
them
its
details
especially
a
curved
pendent
bough
with
its
reflection
in
the
water
which
particularly
pleased
her
sophia
ivanovna
observed
to
me
that
it
was
all
very
beautiful
and
that
she
and
her
sister
would
sometimes
spend
hours
together
at
this
spot
yet
it
was
clear
that
her
remarks
were
meant
merely
to
please
the
princess
i
have
noticed
that
people
who
are
gifted
with
the
faculty
of
loving
are
seldom
receptive
to
the
beauties
of
nature
lubov
sergievna
also
seemed
enraptured
and
asked
among
other
things
how
does
that
birch
tree
manage
to
support
itself
has
it
stood
there
long
yet
the
next
moment
she
became
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
her
little
dog
susetka
which
with
its
stumpy
paws
pattering
to
and
fro
upon
the
bridge
in
a
mincing
fashion
seemed
to
say
by
the
expression
of
its
face
that
this
was
the
first
time
it
had
ever
found
itself
out
of
doors
as
for
dimitri
he
fell
to
discoursing
very
logically
to
his
mother
on
the
subject
of
how
no
view
can
be
beautiful
of
which
the
horizon
is
limited
varenika
alone
said
nothing
glancing
at
her
i
saw
that
she
was
leaning
over
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
her
profile
turned
towards
me
and
gazing
straight
in
front
of
her
something
seemed
to
be
interesting
her
deeply
or
even
affecting
her
since
it
was
clear
that
she
was
oblivious
to
her
surroundings
and
thinking
neither
of
herself
nor
of
the
fact
that
any
one
might
be
regarding
her
in
the
expression
of
her
large
eyes
there
was
nothing
but
wrapt
attention
and
quiet
concentrated
thought
while
her
whole
attitude
seemed
so
unconstrained
and
for
all
her
shortness
so
dignified
that
once
more
some
recollection
or
another
touched
me
and
once
more
i
asked
myself
is
it
then
beginning
yet
again
i
assured
myself
that
i
was
already
in
love
with
sonetchka
and
that
varenika
was
only
an
ordinary
girl
the
sister
of
my
friend
though
she
pleased
me
at
that
moment
i
somehow
felt
a
vague
desire
to
show
her
by
word
or
deed
some
small
unfriendliness
i
tell
you
what
dimitri
i
said
to
my
friend
as
i
moved
nearer
to
varenika
so
that
she
might
overhear
what
i
was
going
to
say
it
seems
to
me
that
even
if
there
had
been
no
mosquitos
here
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
commend
this
spot
whereas
and
here
i
slapped
my
cheek
and
in
very
truth
annihilated
one
of
those
insects
it
is
simply
then
you
do
not
care
for
nature
said
varenika
without
turning
her
head
i
think
it
a
foolish
futile
pursuit
i
replied
well
satisfied
that
i
had
said
something
to
annoy
her
as
well
as
something
original
varenika
only
raised
her
eyebrows
a
little
with
an
expression
of
pity
and
went
on
gazing
in
front
of
her
as
calmly
as
before
i
felt
vexed
with
her
yet
for
all
that
the
rusty
parapet
on
which
she
was
leaning
the
way
in
which
the
dark
waters
of
the
pond
reflected
the
drooping
branch
of
the
overhanging
birch
tree
it
almost
seemed
to
me
as
though
branch
and
its
reflection
met
the
rising
odour
of
the
swamp
the
feeling
of
crushed
mosquito
on
my
cheek
and
her
absorbed
look
and
statuesque
pose
many
times
afterwards
did
these
things
recur
with
unexpected
vividness
to
my
recollection
xxvii
dimitri
when
we
returned
to
the
house
from
our
stroll
varenika
declined
to
sing
as
she
usually
did
in
the
evenings
and
i
was
conceited
enough
to
attribute
this
to
my
doing
in
the
belief
that
its
reason
lay
in
what
i
had
said
on
the
bridge
the
nechludoffs
never
had
supper
and
went
to
bed
early
while
since
dimitri
had
the
toothache
as
sophia
ivanovna
had
foretold
he
departed
with
me
to
his
room
even
earlier
than
usual
feeling
that
i
had
done
all
that
was
required
of
me
by
my
blue
collar
and
gilt
buttons
and
that
every
one
was
very
pleased
with
me
i
was
in
a
gratified
complacent
mood
while
dimitri
on
the
other
hand
was
rendered
by
his
quarrel
with
his
sister
and
the
toothache
both
taciturn
and
gloomy
he
sat
down
at
the
table
got
out
a
couple
of
notebooks
a
diary
and
the
in
which
it
was
his
custom
every
evening
to
inscribe
the
tasks
performed
by
or
awaiting
him
and
continually
frowning
and
touching
his
cheek
with
his
hand
continued
writing
for
a
while
oh
do
leave
me
alone
he
cried
to
the
maid
whom
sophia
ivanovna
sent
to
ask
him
whether
his
teeth
were
still
hurting
him
and
whether
he
would
not
like
to
have
a
poultice
made
then
saying
that
my
bed
would
soon
be
ready
for
me
and
that
he
would
be
back
presently
he
departed
to
lubov
sergievna
s
room
what
a
pity
that
varenika
is
not
and
in
general
sonetchka
i
reflected
when
i
found
myself
alone
how
nice
it
would
be
if
after
i
have
left
the
university
i
could
go
to
her
and
offer
her
my
hand
i
would
say
to
her
princess
though
no
longer
young
and
therefore
unable
to
love
passionately
i
will
cherish
you
as
a
dear
sister
and
you
i
would
continue
to
her
mother
i
greatly
respect
and
you
sophia
ivanovna
i
value
highly
therefore
say
to
me
varenika
since
i
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
just
the
simple
and
direct
word
and
she
would
give
me
her
hand
and
i
should
press
it
and
say
mine
is
a
love
which
depends
not
upon
words
but
upon
and
suppose
next
came
into
my
head
that
dimitri
should
suddenly
fall
in
love
with
lubotshka
as
lubotshka
has
already
done
with
him
and
should
desire
to
marry
her
then
either
one
or
the
other
of
us
would
have
to
resign
all
thought
of
marriage
well
it
would
be
splendid
for
in
that
case
i
should
act
thus
as
soon
as
i
had
noticed
how
things
were
i
should
make
no
remark
but
go
to
dimitri
and
say
it
is
no
use
my
friend
for
you
and
i
to
conceal
our
feelings
from
one
another
you
know
that
my
love
for
your
sister
will
terminate
only
with
my
life
yet
i
know
all
and
though
you
have
deprived
me
of
all
hope
and
have
rendered
me
an
unhappy
man
so
that
nicolas
irtenieff
will
have
to
bewail
his
misery
for
the
rest
of
his
existence
yet
do
you
take
my
sister
and
i
should
lay
his
hand
in
lubotshka
s
then
he
would
say
to
me
no
not
for
all
the
world
and
i
should
reply
prince
nechludoff
it
is
in
vain
for
you
to
attempt
to
outdo
me
in
nobility
not
in
the
whole
world
does
there
exist
a
more
magnanimous
being
than
nicolas
then
i
should
salute
him
and
depart
in
tears
dimitri
and
lubotshka
would
pursue
me
and
entreat
me
to
accept
their
sacrifice
and
i
should
consent
to
do
so
and
perhaps
be
happy
ever
afterwards
if
only
i
were
in
love
with
these
fancies
tickled
my
imagination
so
pleasantly
that
i
felt
as
though
i
should
like
to
communicate
them
to
my
friend
yet
despite
our
mutual
vow
of
frankness
i
also
felt
as
though
i
had
not
the
physical
energy
to
do
so
dimitri
returned
from
lubov
sergievna
s
room
with
some
toothache
capsules
which
she
had
given
him
yet
in
even
greater
pain
and
therefore
in
even
greater
depression
than
before
evidently
no
bedroom
had
yet
been
prepared
for
me
for
presently
the
boy
who
acted
as
dimitri
s
valet
arrived
to
ask
him
where
i
was
to
sleep
oh
go
to
the
devil
cried
dimitri
stamping
his
foot
vasika
vasika
vasika
he
went
on
the
instant
that
the
boy
had
left
the
room
with
a
gradual
raising
of
his
voice
at
each
repetition
vasika
lay
me
out
a
bed
on
the
no
let
me
sleep
on
the
floor
i
objected
well
it
is
all
one
lie
anywhere
you
like
continued
dimitri
in
the
same
angry
tone
vasika
why
don
t
you
go
and
do
what
i
tell
you
evidently
vasika
did
not
understand
what
was
demanded
of
him
for
he
remained
where
he
was
what
is
the
matter
with
you
go
and
lay
the
bed
vasika
i
tell
you
shouted
dimitri
suddenly
bursting
into
a
sort
of
frenzy
yet
vasika
still
did
not
understand
but
blushing
hotly
stood
motionless
so
you
are
determined
to
drive
me
mad
are
you
and
leaping
from
his
chair
and
rushing
upon
the
boy
dimitri
struck
him
on
the
head
with
the
whole
weight
of
his
fist
until
the
boy
rushed
headlong
from
the
room
halting
in
the
doorway
dimitri
glanced
at
me
and
the
expression
of
fury
and
pain
which
had
sat
for
a
moment
on
his
countenance
suddenly
gave
place
to
such
a
boyish
kindly
affectionate
yet
ashamed
expression
that
i
felt
sorry
for
him
and
reconsidered
my
intention
of
leaving
him
to
himself
he
said
nothing
but
for
a
long
time
paced
the
room
in
silence
occasionally
glancing
at
me
with
the
same
deprecatory
expression
as
before
then
he
took
his
notebook
from
the
table
wrote
something
in
it
took
off
his
jacket
and
folded
it
carefully
and
stepping
into
the
corner
where
the
ikon
hung
knelt
down
and
began
to
say
his
prayers
with
his
large
white
hands
folded
upon
his
breast
so
long
did
he
pray
that
vasika
had
time
to
bring
a
mattress
and
spread
it
under
my
whispered
directions
on
the
floor
indeed
i
had
undressed
and
laid
myself
down
upon
the
mattress
before
dimitri
had
finished
as
i
contemplated
his
slightly
rounded
back
and
the
soles
of
his
feet
which
somehow
seemed
to
stick
out
in
my
direction
in
a
sort
of
repentant
fashion
whenever
he
made
his
obeisances
i
felt
that
i
liked
him
more
than
ever
and
debated
within
myself
whether
or
not
i
should
tell
him
all
i
had
been
fancying
concerning
our
respective
sisters
when
he
had
finished
his
prayers
he
lay
down
upon
the
bed
near
me
and
propping
himself
upon
his
elbow
looked
at
me
in
silence
with
a
kindly
yet
abashed
expression
evidently
he
found
it
difficult
to
do
this
yet
meant
thus
to
punish
himself
then
i
smiled
and
returned
his
gaze
and
he
smiled
back
at
me
why
do
you
not
tell
me
that
my
conduct
has
been
abominable
he
said
you
have
been
thinking
so
have
you
not
yes
i
replied
and
although
it
was
something
quite
different
which
had
been
in
my
mind
it
now
seemed
to
me
that
that
was
what
i
had
been
thinking
yes
it
was
not
right
of
you
nor
should
i
have
expected
it
of
it
pleased
me
particularly
at
that
moment
to
call
him
by
the
familiar
second
person
singular
but
how
are
your
teeth
now
i
added
oh
much
better
nicolinka
my
friend
he
went
on
and
so
feelingly
that
it
sounded
as
though
tears
were
standing
in
his
eyes
i
know
and
feel
that
i
am
bad
but
god
sees
how
i
try
to
be
better
and
how
i
entreat
him
to
make
me
so
yet
what
am
i
to
do
with
such
an
unfortunate
horrible
nature
as
mine
what
am
i
to
do
with
it
i
try
to
keep
myself
in
hand
and
to
rule
myself
but
suddenly
it
becomes
impossible
for
me
to
do
so
at
all
events
impossible
for
me
to
do
so
unaided
i
need
the
help
and
support
of
some
one
now
there
is
lubov
sergievna
she
understands
me
and
could
help
me
in
this
and
i
know
by
my
notebook
that
i
have
greatly
improved
in
this
respect
during
the
past
year
ah
my
dear
nicolinka
he
spoke
with
the
most
unusual
and
unwonted
tenderness
and
in
a
tone
which
had
grown
calmer
now
that
he
had
made
his
confession
how
much
the
influence
of
a
woman
like
lubov
could
do
for
me
think
how
good
it
would
be
for
me
if
i
could
have
a
friend
like
her
to
live
with
when
i
have
become
independent
with
her
i
should
be
another
and
upon
that
dimitri
began
to
unfold
to
me
his
plans
for
marriage
for
a
life
in
the
country
and
for
continual
yes
i
will
live
in
the
country
he
said
and
you
shall
come
to
see
me
when
you
have
married
sonetchka
our
children
shall
play
together
all
this
may
seem
to
you
stupid
and
ridiculous
yet
it
may
very
well
come
to
yes
it
very
well
may
i
replied
with
a
smile
yet
thinking
how
much
nicer
it
would
be
if
i
married
his
sister
i
tell
you
what
he
went
on
presently
you
only
imagine
yourself
to
be
in
love
with
sonetchka
whereas
i
can
see
that
it
is
all
rubbish
and
that
you
do
not
really
know
what
love
i
did
not
protest
for
in
truth
i
almost
agreed
with
him
and
for
a
while
we
lay
without
speaking
probably
you
have
noticed
that
i
have
been
in
my
old
bad
humour
today
and
have
had
a
nasty
quarrel
with
varia
he
resumed
i
felt
bad
about
it
afterwards
more
particularly
since
it
occurred
in
your
presence
although
she
thinks
wrongly
on
some
subjects
she
is
a
splendid
girl
and
very
good
as
you
will
soon
his
quick
transition
from
mention
of
my
love
affairs
to
praise
of
his
sister
pleased
me
extremely
and
made
me
blush
but
i
nevertheless
said
nothing
more
about
his
sister
and
we
went
on
talking
of
other
things
thus
we
chattered
until
the
cocks
had
crowed
twice
in
fact
the
pale
dawn
was
already
looking
in
at
the
window
when
at
last
dimitri
lay
down
upon
his
bed
and
put
out
the
candle
well
now
for
sleep
he
said
yes
i
replied
but
but
what
now
nice
it
is
to
be
alive
in
the
daylight
yes
it
is
a
splendid
thing
he
replied
in
a
voice
which
even
in
the
darkness
enabled
me
to
see
the
expression
of
his
cheerful
kindly
eyes
and
boyish
smile
xxviii
in
the
country
next
day
woloda
and
myself
departed
in
a
for
the
country
turning
over
various
moscow
recollections
in
my
head
as
we
drove
along
i
suddenly
recalled
sonetchka
valakhin
though
not
until
evening
and
when
we
had
already
covered
five
stages
of
the
road
it
is
a
strange
thing
i
thought
that
i
should
be
in
love
and
yet
have
forgotten
all
about
it
i
must
start
and
think
about
her
and
straightway
i
proceeded
to
do
so
but
only
in
the
way
that
one
thinks
when
travelling
that
is
to
say
disconnectedly
though
vividly
thus
i
brought
myself
to
such
a
condition
that
for
the
first
two
days
after
our
arrival
home
i
somehow
considered
it
incumbent
upon
me
always
to
appear
sad
and
moody
in
the
presence
of
the
household
and
especially
before
katenka
whom
i
looked
upon
as
a
great
connoisseur
in
matters
of
this
kind
and
to
whom
i
threw
out
a
hint
of
the
condition
in
which
my
heart
was
situated
yet
for
all
my
attempts
at
dissimulation
and
assiduous
adoption
of
such
signs
of
love
sickness
as
i
had
occasionally
observed
in
other
people
i
only
succeeded
for
two
days
and
that
at
intervals
and
mostly
towards
evening
in
reminding
myself
of
the
fact
that
i
was
in
love
and
finally
when
i
had
settled
down
into
the
new
rut
of
country
life
and
pursuits
i
forgot
about
my
affection
for
sonetchka
altogether
we
arrived
at
petrovskoe
in
the
night
time
and
i
was
then
so
soundly
asleep
that
i
saw
nothing
of
the
house
as
we
approached
it
nor
yet
of
the
avenue
of
birch
trees
nor
yet
of
the
household
all
of
whom
had
long
ago
betaken
themselves
to
bed
and
to
slumber
only
old
hunchbacked
foka
clad
in
some
sort
of
a
woman
s
wadded
nightdress
and
carrying
a
candlestick
opened
the
door
to
us
as
soon
as
he
saw
who
we
were
he
trembled
all
over
with
joy
kissed
us
on
the
shoulders
hurriedly
put
on
his
felt
slippers
and
started
to
dress
himself
properly
i
passed
in
a
condition
through
the
porch
and
up
the
steps
but
in
the
hall
the
lock
of
the
door
the
bars
and
bolts
the
crooked
boards
of
the
flooring
the
chest
the
ancient
candelabrum
splashed
all
over
with
grease
as
of
old
the
shadows
thrown
by
the
crooked
chill
stump
of
candle
the
perennially
dusty
unopened
window
behind
which
i
remembered
sorrel
to
have
grown
all
was
so
familiar
so
full
of
memories
so
intimate
of
aspect
so
as
it
were
knit
together
by
a
single
idea
that
i
suddenly
became
conscious
of
a
tenderness
for
this
quiet
old
house
involuntarily
i
asked
myself
how
have
we
the
house
and
i
managed
to
remain
apart
so
long
and
hurrying
from
spot
to
spot
ran
to
see
if
all
the
other
rooms
were
still
the
same
yes
everything
was
unchanged
except
that
everything
had
become
smaller
and
lower
and
i
myself
taller
heavier
and
more
filled
out
yet
even
as
i
was
the
old
house
received
me
back
into
its
arms
and
aroused
in
me
with
every
board
every
window
every
step
of
the
stairs
and
every
sound
the
shadows
of
forms
feelings
and
events
of
the
happy
but
irrevocable
past
when
we
entered
our
old
night
nursery
all
my
childish
fears
lurked
once
more
in
the
darkness
of
the
corners
and
doorway
when
we
passed
into
the
i
could
feel
the
old
calm
motherly
love
diffusing
itself
from
every
object
in
the
apartment
in
the
the
noisy
careless
merriment
of
childhood
seemed
merely
to
be
waiting
to
wake
to
life
again
in
the
divannaia
whither
foka
first
conducted
us
and
where
he
had
prepared
our
beds
everything
mirror
screen
old
wooden
ikon
the
lumps
on
the
walls
covered
with
white
paper
seemed
to
speak
of
suffering
and
of
death
and
of
what
would
never
come
back
to
us
again
we
got
into
bed
and
foka
bidding
us
retired
it
was
in
this
room
that
mamma
died
was
it
not
said
woloda
i
made
no
reply
but
pretended
to
be
asleep
if
i
had
said
anything
i
should
have
burst
into
tears
on
awaking
next
morning
i
beheld
papa
sitting
on
woloda
s
bed
in
his
dressing
gown
and
slippers
and
smoking
a
cigar
leaping
up
with
a
merry
hoist
of
the
shoulders
he
came
over
to
me
slapped
me
on
the
back
with
his
great
hand
and
presented
me
his
cheek
to
press
my
lips
to
well
done
diplomat
he
said
in
his
most
kindly
jesting
tone
as
he
looked
at
me
with
his
small
bright
eyes
woloda
tells
me
you
have
passed
the
examinations
well
for
a
youngster
and
that
is
a
splendid
thing
unless
you
start
and
play
the
fool
i
shall
have
another
fine
little
fellow
in
you
thanks
my
dear
boy
well
we
will
have
a
grand
time
of
it
here
now
and
in
the
winter
perhaps
we
shall
move
to
petersburg
i
only
wish
the
hunting
was
not
over
yet
or
i
could
have
given
you
some
amusement
in
that
way
can
you
shoot
woldemar
however
whether
there
is
any
game
or
not
i
will
take
you
out
some
day
next
winter
if
god
pleases
we
will
move
to
petersburg
and
you
shall
meet
people
and
make
friends
for
you
are
now
my
two
young
i
have
been
telling
woldemar
that
you
are
just
starting
on
your
careers
whereas
my
day
is
ended
you
are
old
enough
now
to
walk
by
yourselves
but
whenever
you
wish
to
confide
in
me
pray
do
so
for
i
am
no
longer
your
nurse
but
your
friend
at
least
i
will
be
your
friend
and
comrade
and
adviser
as
much
as
i
can
and
more
than
that
i
can
not
do
how
does
that
fall
in
with
your
philosophy
eh
koko
well
or
ill
eh
of
course
i
said
that
it
fell
in
with
it
entirely
and
indeed
i
really
thought
so
that
morning
papa
had
a
particularly
winning
bright
and
happy
expression
on
his
face
and
these
new
relations
between
us
as
of
equals
and
comrades
made
me
love
him
all
the
more
now
tell
me
he
went
on
did
you
call
upon
all
our
kinsfolk
and
the
iwins
did
you
see
the
old
man
and
what
did
he
say
to
you
and
did
you
go
to
prince
ivan
s
we
continued
talking
so
long
that
before
we
were
fully
dressed
the
sun
had
left
the
window
of
the
divannaia
and
jakoff
the
same
old
man
who
of
yore
had
twirled
his
fingers
behind
his
back
and
always
repeated
his
words
had
entered
the
room
and
reported
to
papa
that
the
carriage
was
ready
where
are
you
going
to
i
asked
papa
oh
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
he
replied
with
a
cough
and
the
usual
hoisting
of
his
shoulder
i
promised
to
go
and
call
upon
epifanova
you
remember
epifanova
la
belle
flamande
don
t
you
who
used
to
come
and
see
your
mamma
they
are
nice
and
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
so
it
appeared
to
me
papa
left
the
room
during
our
conversation
lubotshka
had
more
than
once
come
to
the
door
and
asked
can
i
come
in
but
papa
had
always
shouted
to
her
that
she
could
not
do
so
since
we
were
not
dressed
yet
what
rubbish
she
replied
why
i
have
seen
you
in
your
never
mind
you
can
not
see
your
brothers
without
their
inexpressibles
rejoined
papa
if
they
each
of
them
just
go
to
the
door
let
that
be
enough
for
you
now
go
even
for
them
to
speak
to
you
in
such
a
neglige
costume
is
how
unbearable
you
are
was
lubotshka
s
parting
retort
well
at
least
hurry
up
and
come
down
to
the
for
mimi
wants
to
see
as
soon
as
papa
had
left
the
room
i
hastened
to
array
myself
in
my
student
s
uniform
and
to
repair
to
the
woloda
on
the
other
hand
was
in
no
hurry
but
remained
sitting
on
his
bed
and
talking
to
jakoff
about
the
best
places
to
find
plover
and
snipe
as
i
have
said
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
he
so
much
feared
as
to
be
suspected
of
any
affection
for
his
father
brother
and
sister
so
that
to
escape
any
expression
of
that
feeling
he
often
fell
into
the
other
extreme
and
affected
a
coldness
which
shocked
people
who
did
not
comprehend
its
cause
in
the
hall
i
collided
with
papa
who
was
hurrying
towards
the
carriage
with
short
rapid
steps
he
had
a
new
and
fashionable
moscow
greatcoat
on
and
smelt
of
scent
on
seeing
me
he
gave
a
cheerful
nod
as
much
as
to
say
do
you
remark
my
splendour
and
once
again
i
was
struck
with
the
happy
expression
of
face
which
i
had
noted
earlier
in
the
morning
the
looked
the
same
lofty
bright
room
as
of
yore
with
its
brown
english
piano
and
its
large
open
windows
looking
on
to
the
green
trees
and
paths
of
the
garden
after
kissing
mimi
and
lubotshka
i
was
approaching
katenka
for
the
same
purpose
when
it
suddenly
struck
me
that
it
might
be
improper
for
me
to
salute
her
in
that
fashion
accordingly
i
halted
silent
and
blushing
katenka
for
her
part
was
quite
at
her
ease
as
she
held
out
a
white
hand
to
me
and
congratulated
me
on
my
passing
into
the
university
the
same
thing
took
place
when
woloda
entered
the
and
met
katenka
indeed
it
was
something
of
a
problem
how
after
being
brought
up
together
and
seeing
one
another
daily
we
ought
now
after
this
first
separation
to
meet
again
katenka
had
grown
than
any
of
us
yet
woloda
seemed
not
at
all
confused
as
with
a
slight
bow
to
her
he
crossed
over
to
lubotshka
made
a
jesting
remark
to
her
and
then
departed
somewhere
on
some
solitary
expedition
xxix
relations
between
the
girls
and
ourselves
of
the
girls
woloda
took
the
strange
view
that
although
he
wished
that
they
should
have
enough
to
eat
should
sleep
well
be
well
dressed
and
avoid
making
such
mistakes
in
french
as
would
shame
him
before
strangers
he
would
never
admit
that
they
could
think
or
feel
like
human
beings
still
less
that
they
could
converse
with
him
sensibly
about
anything
whenever
they
addressed
to
him
a
serious
question
a
thing
by
the
way
which
he
always
tried
to
avoid
such
as
asking
his
opinion
on
a
novel
or
inquiring
about
his
doings
at
the
university
he
invariably
pulled
a
grimace
and
either
turned
away
without
speaking
or
answered
with
some
nonsensical
french
phrase
comme
c
est
tres
jolie
or
the
like
or
again
feigning
to
look
serious
and
stolidly
wise
he
would
say
something
absolutely
meaningless
and
bearing
no
relation
whatever
to
the
question
asked
him
or
else
suddenly
exclaim
with
a
look
of
pretended
unconsciousness
the
word
bulku
or
poyechali
or
kapustu
respectively
roll
of
butter
away
and
or
something
of
the
kind
and
when
afterwards
i
happened
to
repeat
these
words
to
him
as
having
been
told
me
by
lubotshka
or
katenka
he
would
always
remark
hm
so
you
actually
care
about
talking
to
them
i
can
see
you
are
a
duffer
still
and
one
needed
to
see
and
near
him
to
appreciate
the
profound
immutable
contempt
which
echoed
in
this
remark
he
had
been
now
two
years
and
was
in
love
with
every
woman
that
he
met
yet
despite
the
fact
that
he
came
in
daily
contact
with
katenka
who
during
those
two
years
had
been
wearing
long
dresses
and
was
growing
prettier
every
day
the
possibility
of
his
falling
in
love
with
her
never
seemed
to
enter
his
head
whether
this
proceeded
from
the
fact
that
the
prosaic
recollections
of
childhood
were
still
too
fresh
in
his
memory
or
whether
from
the
aversion
which
very
young
people
feel
for
everything
domestic
or
whether
from
the
common
human
weakness
which
at
a
first
encounter
with
anything
fair
and
pretty
leads
a
man
to
say
to
himself
ah
i
shall
meet
much
more
of
the
same
kind
during
my
life
but
at
all
events
woloda
had
never
yet
looked
upon
katenka
with
a
man
s
eyes
all
that
summer
woloda
appeared
to
find
things
very
wearisome
a
fact
which
arose
out
of
that
contempt
for
us
all
which
as
i
have
said
he
made
no
effort
to
conceal
his
expression
of
face
seemed
to
be
constantly
saying
phew
how
it
bores
me
to
have
no
one
to
speak
to
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
he
would
go
out
shooting
or
sit
reading
a
book
in
his
room
and
not
dress
until
luncheon
time
indeed
if
papa
was
not
at
home
he
would
take
his
book
into
that
meal
and
go
on
reading
it
without
addressing
so
much
as
a
single
word
to
any
one
of
us
who
felt
somehow
guilty
in
his
presence
in
the
evening
too
he
would
stretch
himself
on
a
settee
in
the
and
either
go
to
sleep
propped
on
his
elbow
or
tell
us
farcical
stories
sometimes
stories
so
improper
as
to
make
mimi
grow
angry
and
blush
and
ourselves
die
with
laughter
at
other
times
he
would
not
condescend
to
address
a
single
serious
word
to
any
member
of
the
family
except
papa
or
occasionally
myself
involuntarily
i
offended
against
his
view
of
girls
seeing
that
i
was
not
so
afraid
of
seeming
affectionate
as
he
and
moreover
had
not
such
a
profound
and
confirmed
contempt
for
young
women
yet
several
times
that
summer
when
driven
by
lack
of
amusement
to
try
and
engage
lubotshka
and
katenka
in
conversation
i
always
encountered
in
them
such
an
absence
of
any
capacity
for
logical
thinking
and
such
an
ignorance
of
the
simplest
most
ordinary
matters
as
for
instance
the
nature
of
money
the
subjects
studied
at
universities
the
effect
of
war
and
so
forth
as
well
as
such
indifference
to
my
explanations
of
such
matters
that
these
attempts
of
mine
only
ended
in
confirming
my
unfavourable
opinion
of
feminine
ability
i
remember
one
evening
when
lubotshka
kept
repeating
some
unbearably
tedious
passage
on
the
piano
about
a
hundred
times
in
succession
while
woloda
who
was
dozing
on
a
settee
in
the
kept
addressing
no
one
in
particular
as
he
muttered
lord
how
she
murders
it
what
a
musician
what
a
beethoven
he
always
pronounced
the
composer
s
name
with
especial
irony
wrong
again
now
a
second
time
that
s
it
and
so
on
meanwhile
katenka
and
i
were
sitting
by
the
and
somehow
she
began
to
talk
about
her
favourite
subject
love
i
was
in
the
right
frame
of
mind
to
philosophise
and
began
by
loftily
defining
love
as
the
wish
to
acquire
in
another
what
one
does
not
possess
in
oneself
to
this
katenka
retorted
that
on
the
contrary
love
is
not
love
at
all
if
a
girl
desires
to
marry
a
man
for
his
money
alone
but
that
in
her
opinion
riches
were
a
vain
thing
and
true
love
only
the
affection
which
can
stand
the
test
of
separation
this
i
took
to
be
a
hint
concerning
her
love
for
dubkoff
at
this
point
woloda
who
must
have
been
listening
all
the
time
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
cried
out
some
rubbish
or
another
and
i
felt
that
he
was
right
apart
from
the
general
faculties
more
or
less
developed
in
different
persons
of
intellect
sensibility
and
artistic
feeling
there
also
exists
more
or
less
developed
in
different
circles
of
society
and
especially
in
families
a
private
or
individual
faculty
which
i
may
call
apprehension
the
essence
of
this
faculty
lies
in
sympathetic
appreciation
of
proportion
and
in
identical
understanding
of
things
two
individuals
who
possess
this
faculty
and
belong
to
the
same
social
circle
or
the
same
family
apprehend
an
expression
of
feeling
precisely
to
the
same
point
namely
the
point
beyond
which
such
expression
becomes
mere
phrasing
thus
they
apprehend
precisely
where
commendation
ends
and
irony
begins
where
attraction
ends
and
pretence
begins
in
a
manner
which
would
be
impossible
for
persons
possessed
of
a
different
order
of
apprehension
persons
possessed
of
identical
apprehension
view
objects
in
an
identically
ludicrous
beautiful
or
repellent
light
and
in
order
to
facilitate
such
identical
apprehension
between
members
of
the
same
social
circle
or
family
they
usually
establish
a
language
turns
of
speech
or
terms
to
define
such
shades
of
apprehension
as
exist
for
them
alone
in
our
particular
family
such
apprehension
was
common
to
papa
woloda
and
myself
and
was
developed
to
the
highest
pitch
dubkoff
also
approximated
to
our
coterie
in
apprehension
but
dimitri
though
infinitely
more
intellectual
than
dubkoff
was
grosser
in
this
respect
with
no
one
however
did
i
bring
this
faculty
to
such
a
point
as
with
woloda
who
had
grown
up
with
me
under
identical
conditions
papa
stood
a
long
way
from
us
and
much
that
was
to
us
as
clear
as
two
and
two
make
four
was
to
him
incomprehensible
for
instance
i
and
woloda
managed
to
establish
between
ourselves
the
following
terms
with
meanings
to
correspond
izium
raisins
meant
a
desire
to
boast
of
one
s
money
shishka
bump
or
swelling
on
pronouncing
which
one
had
to
join
one
s
fingers
together
and
to
put
a
particular
emphasis
upon
the
two
sh
s
in
the
word
meant
anything
fresh
healthy
and
comely
but
not
elegant
a
substantive
used
in
the
plural
meant
an
undue
partiality
for
the
object
which
it
denoted
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
at
the
same
time
the
meaning
depended
considerably
upon
the
expression
of
the
face
and
the
context
of
the
conversation
so
that
no
matter
what
new
expression
one
of
us
might
invent
to
define
a
shade
of
feeling
the
other
could
immediately
understand
it
by
a
hint
alone
the
girls
did
not
share
this
faculty
of
apprehension
and
herein
lay
the
chief
cause
of
our
moral
estrangement
and
of
the
contempt
which
we
felt
for
them
it
may
be
that
they
too
had
their
apprehension
but
it
so
little
ran
with
ours
that
where
we
already
perceived
the
phrasing
they
still
saw
only
the
feeling
our
irony
was
for
them
truth
and
so
on
at
that
time
i
had
not
yet
learnt
to
understand
that
they
were
in
no
way
to
blame
for
this
and
that
absence
of
such
apprehension
in
no
way
prevented
them
from
being
good
and
clever
girls
accordingly
i
looked
down
upon
them
moreover
having
once
lit
upon
my
precious
idea
of
frankness
and
being
bent
upon
applying
it
to
the
full
in
myself
i
thought
the
quiet
confiding
nature
of
lubotshka
guilty
of
secretiveness
and
dissimulation
simply
because
she
saw
no
necessity
for
digging
up
and
examining
all
her
thoughts
and
instincts
for
instance
the
fact
that
she
always
signed
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
papa
before
going
to
bed
that
she
and
katenka
invariably
wept
in
church
when
attending
requiem
masses
for
mamma
and
that
katenka
sighed
and
rolled
her
eyes
about
when
playing
the
piano
all
these
things
seemed
to
me
sheer
and
i
asked
myself
at
what
period
did
they
learn
to
pretend
like
people
and
how
can
they
bring
themselves
to
do
it
xxx
how
i
employed
my
time
nevertheless
the
fact
that
that
summer
i
developed
a
passion
for
music
caused
me
to
become
better
friends
with
the
ladies
of
our
household
than
i
had
been
for
years
in
the
spring
a
young
fellow
came
to
see
us
armed
with
a
letter
of
introduction
who
as
soon
as
ever
he
entered
the
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
piano
and
kept
gradually
edging
his
chair
closer
to
it
as
he
talked
to
mimi
and
katenka
after
discoursing
awhile
of
the
weather
and
the
amenities
of
country
life
he
skilfully
directed
the
conversation
to
music
and
pianos
generally
and
ended
by
saying
that
he
himself
played
and
in
truth
he
did
sit
down
and
perform
three
waltzes
with
mimi
lubotshka
and
katenka
grouped
about
the
instrument
and
watching
him
as
he
did
so
he
never
came
to
see
us
again
but
his
playing
and
his
attitude
when
at
the
piano
and
the
way
in
which
he
kept
shaking
his
long
hair
and
most
of
all
the
manner
in
which
he
was
able
to
execute
octaves
with
his
left
hand
as
he
first
of
all
played
them
rapidly
with
his
thumb
and
little
finger
and
then
slowly
closed
those
members
and
then
played
the
octaves
afresh
made
a
great
impression
upon
me
this
graceful
gesture
of
his
together
with
his
easy
pose
and
his
shaking
of
hair
and
successful
winning
of
the
ladies
applause
by
his
talent
ended
by
firing
me
to
take
up
the
piano
convinced
that
i
possessed
both
talent
and
a
passion
for
music
i
set
myself
to
learn
and
in
doing
so
acted
just
as
millions
of
the
male
still
more
of
the
female
sex
have
done
who
try
to
teach
themselves
without
a
skilled
instructor
without
any
real
turn
for
the
art
or
without
the
smallest
understanding
either
of
what
the
art
can
give
or
of
what
ought
to
be
done
to
obtain
that
gift
for
me
music
or
rather
was
simply
a
means
of
winning
the
ladies
good
graces
through
their
sensibility
with
the
help
of
katenka
i
first
learnt
the
notes
incidentally
breaking
several
of
them
with
my
clumsy
fingers
and
then
that
is
to
say
after
two
months
of
hard
work
supplemented
by
ceaseless
twiddling
of
my
rebellious
fingers
on
my
knees
after
luncheon
and
on
the
pillow
when
in
bed
went
on
to
pieces
which
i
played
so
katenka
assured
me
with
soul
avec
ame
but
altogether
regardless
of
time
my
range
of
pieces
was
the
usual
one
waltzes
galops
romances
arrangements
etcetera
all
of
them
of
the
class
of
delightful
compositions
of
which
any
one
with
a
little
healthy
taste
could
point
out
a
selection
among
the
better
class
works
contained
in
any
volume
of
music
and
say
these
are
what
you
ought
not
to
play
seeing
that
anything
worse
less
tasteful
and
more
silly
has
never
yet
been
included
in
any
collection
of
music
but
which
probably
for
that
very
reason
are
to
be
found
on
the
piano
of
every
russian
lady
true
we
also
possessed
an
unfortunate
volume
which
contained
beethoven
s
sonate
pathetique
and
the
c
minor
sonata
a
volume
lamed
for
life
by
the
ladies
more
especially
by
lubotshka
who
used
to
discourse
music
from
it
in
memory
of
mamma
as
well
as
certain
other
good
pieces
which
her
teacher
in
moscow
had
given
her
but
among
that
collection
there
were
likewise
compositions
of
the
teacher
s
own
in
the
shape
of
clumsy
marches
and
galops
and
these
too
lubotshka
used
to
play
katenka
and
i
cared
nothing
for
serious
works
but
preferred
above
all
things
le
fou
and
the
nightingale
the
latter
of
which
katenka
would
play
until
her
fingers
almost
became
invisible
and
which
i
too
was
beginning
to
execute
with
much
vigour
and
some
continuity
i
had
adopted
the
gestures
of
the
young
man
of
whom
i
have
spoken
and
frequently
regretted
that
there
were
no
strangers
present
to
see
me
play
soon
however
i
began
to
realise
that
liszt
and
kalkbrenner
were
beyond
me
and
that
i
should
never
overtake
katenka
accordingly
imagining
that
classical
music
was
easier
as
well
as
partly
for
the
sake
of
originality
i
suddenly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
loved
abstruse
german
music
i
began
to
go
into
raptures
whenever
lubotshka
played
the
sonate
pathetique
and
although
if
the
truth
be
told
that
work
had
for
years
driven
me
to
the
verge
of
distraction
i
set
myself
to
play
beethoven
and
to
talk
of
him
as
yet
through
all
this
chopping
and
changing
and
pretence
as
i
now
conceive
there
may
have
run
in
me
a
certain
vein
of
talent
since
music
sometimes
affected
me
even
to
tears
and
things
which
particularly
pleased
me
i
could
strum
on
the
piano
afterwards
in
a
certain
fashion
without
the
score
so
that
had
any
one
taught
me
at
that
period
to
look
upon
music
as
an
end
a
grace
in
itself
and
not
merely
as
a
means
for
pleasing
womenfolk
with
the
velocity
and
of
one
s
playing
i
might
possibly
have
become
a
passable
musician
the
reading
of
french
novels
of
which
woloda
had
brought
a
large
store
with
him
from
moscow
was
another
of
my
amusements
that
summer
at
that
period
monte
cristo
and
taine
s
works
had
just
appeared
while
i
also
revelled
in
stories
by
sue
dumas
and
paul
de
kock
even
their
most
unnatural
personages
and
events
were
for
me
as
real
as
actuality
and
not
only
was
i
incapable
of
suspecting
an
author
of
lying
but
in
my
eyes
there
existed
no
author
at
all
that
is
to
say
the
various
personages
and
events
of
a
book
paraded
themselves
before
me
on
the
printed
page
as
personages
and
events
that
were
alive
and
real
and
although
i
had
never
in
my
life
met
such
characters
as
i
there
read
about
i
never
for
a
second
doubted
that
i
should
one
day
do
so
i
discovered
in
myself
all
the
passions
described
in
every
novel
as
well
as
a
likeness
to
all
the
characters
heroes
and
villains
impartially
who
figured
therein
just
as
a
suspicious
man
finds
in
himself
the
signs
of
every
possible
disease
when
reading
a
book
on
medicine
i
took
pleasure
both
in
the
cunning
designs
the
glowing
sentiments
the
tumultuous
events
and
the
of
these
works
a
good
man
was
of
the
goodness
a
bad
man
of
the
badness
possible
only
to
the
imagination
of
early
youth
likewise
i
found
great
pleasure
in
the
fact
that
it
was
all
written
in
french
and
that
i
could
lay
to
heart
the
fine
words
which
the
fine
heroes
spoke
and
recall
them
for
use
some
day
when
engaged
in
some
noble
deed
what
quantities
of
french
phrases
i
culled
from
those
books
for
kolpikoff
s
benefit
if
i
should
ever
meet
him
again
as
well
as
for
hers
when
at
length
i
should
find
her
and
reveal
to
her
my
love
for
them
both
i
prepared
speeches
which
should
overcome
them
as
soon
as
spoken
upon
novels
too
i
founded
new
ideals
of
the
moral
qualities
which
i
wished
to
attain
first
of
all
i
wished
to
be
noble
in
all
my
deeds
and
conduct
i
use
the
french
word
noble
instead
of
the
russian
word
blagorodni
for
the
reason
that
the
former
has
a
different
meaning
to
the
latter
as
the
germans
well
understood
when
they
adopted
noble
as
nobel
and
differentiated
it
from
ehrlich
next
to
be
strenuous
and
lastly
to
be
what
i
was
already
inclined
to
be
namely
comme
il
faut
i
even
tried
to
approximate
my
appearance
and
bearing
to
that
of
the
heroes
who
possessed
these
qualities
in
particular
i
remember
how
in
one
of
the
hundred
or
so
novels
which
i
read
that
summer
there
was
a
very
strenuous
hero
with
heavy
eyebrows
and
that
i
so
greatly
wished
to
resemble
him
i
felt
that
i
did
so
already
from
a
moral
point
of
view
that
one
day
when
looking
at
my
eyebrows
in
the
glass
i
conceived
the
idea
of
clipping
them
in
order
to
make
them
grow
bushier
unfortunately
after
i
had
started
to
do
so
i
happened
to
clip
one
spot
rather
shorter
than
the
rest
and
so
had
to
level
down
the
rest
to
the
result
that
to
my
horror
i
beheld
myself
and
anything
but
presentable
however
i
comforted
myself
with
the
reflection
that
my
eyebrows
would
soon
sprout
again
as
bushy
as
my
hero
s
and
was
only
perplexed
to
think
how
i
could
explain
the
circumstance
to
the
household
when
they
next
perceived
my
condition
accordingly
i
borrowed
some
gunpowder
from
woloda
rubbed
it
on
my
temples
and
set
it
alight
the
powder
did
not
fire
properly
but
i
succeeded
in
singeing
myself
sufficiently
to
avert
all
suspicion
of
my
pranks
and
indeed
afterwards
when
i
had
forgotten
all
about
my
hero
my
eyebrows
grew
again
and
much
thicker
than
they
had
been
before
xxxi
comme
il
faut
several
times
in
the
course
of
this
narrative
i
have
hinted
at
an
idea
corresponding
to
the
above
french
heading
and
now
feel
it
incumbent
upon
me
to
devote
a
whole
chapter
to
that
idea
which
was
one
of
the
most
ruinous
lying
notions
which
ever
became
engrafted
upon
my
life
by
my
upbringing
and
social
milieu
the
human
race
may
be
divided
into
several
categories
rich
and
poor
good
and
bad
military
and
civilian
clever
and
stupid
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
yet
each
man
has
his
own
favourite
fundamental
system
of
division
which
he
unconsciously
uses
to
class
each
new
person
with
whom
he
meets
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
my
own
favourite
fundamental
system
of
division
in
this
respect
was
into
people
comme
il
faut
and
people
comme
il
ne
faut
pas
the
latter
subdivided
again
into
people
merely
not
comme
il
faut
and
the
lower
orders
people
comme
il
faut
i
respected
and
looked
upon
as
worthy
to
consort
with
me
as
my
equals
the
second
of
the
above
categories
i
pretended
merely
to
despise
but
in
reality
hated
and
nourished
towards
them
a
kind
of
feeling
of
offended
personality
while
the
third
category
had
no
existence
at
all
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
since
my
contempt
for
them
was
too
complete
this
comme
il
faut
of
mine
lay
first
and
foremost
in
proficiency
in
french
especially
conversational
french
a
person
who
spoke
that
language
badly
at
once
aroused
in
me
a
feeling
of
dislike
why
do
you
try
to
talk
as
we
do
when
you
haven
t
a
notion
how
to
do
it
i
would
seem
to
ask
him
with
my
most
venomous
and
quizzing
smile
the
second
condition
of
comme
il
faut
was
long
nails
that
were
well
kept
and
clean
the
third
ability
to
bow
dance
and
converse
the
fourth
and
a
very
important
one
indifference
to
everything
and
a
constant
air
of
refined
supercilious
ennui
moreover
there
were
certain
general
signs
which
i
considered
enabled
me
to
tell
without
actually
speaking
to
a
man
the
class
to
which
he
belonged
chief
among
these
signs
the
others
being
the
fittings
of
his
rooms
his
gloves
his
handwriting
his
and
so
forth
were
his
feet
the
relation
of
boots
to
trousers
was
sufficient
to
determine
in
my
eyes
the
social
status
of
a
man
heelless
boots
with
angular
toes
wedded
to
narrow
unstrapped
these
denoted
the
vulgarian
boots
with
narrow
round
toes
and
heels
accompanied
either
by
tight
trousers
strapped
under
the
instep
and
fitting
close
to
the
leg
or
by
wide
trousers
similarly
strapped
but
projecting
in
a
peak
over
the
toe
these
meant
the
man
of
mauvais
genre
and
so
on
and
so
on
it
was
a
curious
thing
that
i
who
lacked
all
ability
to
become
comme
il
faut
should
have
assimilated
the
idea
so
completely
as
i
did
possibly
it
was
the
fact
that
it
had
cost
me
such
enormous
labour
to
acquire
that
brought
about
its
strenuous
development
in
my
mind
i
hardly
like
to
think
how
much
of
the
best
and
most
valuable
time
of
my
first
sixteen
years
of
existence
i
wasted
upon
its
acquisition
yet
every
one
whom
i
imitated
woloda
dubkoff
and
the
majority
of
my
acquaintances
seemed
to
acquire
it
easily
i
watched
them
with
envy
and
silently
toiled
to
become
proficient
in
french
to
bow
gracefully
and
without
looking
at
the
person
whom
i
was
saluting
to
gain
dexterity
in
and
dancing
to
cultivate
indifference
and
ennui
and
to
keep
my
fingernails
well
trimmed
though
i
frequently
cut
my
with
the
scissors
in
so
doing
and
all
the
time
i
felt
that
so
much
remained
to
be
done
if
i
was
ever
to
attain
my
end
a
room
a
an
equipage
i
still
found
it
impossible
to
arrange
comme
il
faut
however
much
i
fought
down
my
aversion
to
practical
matters
in
my
desire
to
become
proficient
yet
everything
seemed
to
arrange
itself
properly
with
other
people
just
as
though
things
could
never
have
been
otherwise
once
i
remember
asking
dubkoff
after
much
zealous
and
careful
labouring
at
my
his
own
were
extraordinarily
good
whether
his
nails
had
always
been
as
now
or
whether
he
had
done
anything
to
make
them
so
to
which
he
replied
that
never
within
his
recollection
had
he
done
anything
to
them
and
that
he
could
not
imagine
a
gentleman
s
nails
possibly
being
different
this
answer
incensed
me
greatly
for
i
had
not
yet
learnt
that
one
of
the
chief
conditions
of
comme
il
faut
was
to
hold
one
s
tongue
about
the
labour
by
which
it
had
been
acquired
comme
il
faut
i
looked
upon
as
not
only
a
great
merit
a
splendid
accomplishment
an
embodiment
of
all
the
perfection
which
must
strive
to
attain
but
as
the
one
indispensable
condition
without
which
there
could
never
be
happiness
nor
glory
nor
any
good
whatsoever
in
this
world
even
the
greatest
artist
or
savant
or
benefactor
of
the
human
race
would
at
that
time
have
won
from
me
no
respect
if
he
had
not
also
been
comme
il
a
man
possessed
of
comme
il
faut
stood
higher
than
and
beyond
all
possible
equality
with
such
people
and
might
well
leave
it
to
them
to
paint
pictures
to
compose
music
to
write
books
or
to
do
good
possibly
he
might
commend
them
for
so
doing
since
why
should
not
merit
be
commended
it
be
found
but
he
could
never
stand
on
a
level
with
them
seeing
that
he
was
comme
il
faut
and
they
were
not
a
quite
final
and
sufficient
reason
in
fact
i
actually
believe
that
had
we
possessed
a
brother
or
a
father
or
a
mother
who
had
not
been
comme
il
faut
i
should
have
declared
it
to
be
a
great
misfortune
for
us
and
announced
that
between
myself
and
them
there
could
never
be
anything
in
common
yet
neither
waste
of
the
golden
hours
which
i
consumed
in
constantly
endeavouring
to
observe
the
many
arduous
unattainable
conditions
of
comme
il
faut
to
the
exclusion
of
any
more
serious
pursuit
nor
dislike
of
and
contempt
for
of
the
human
race
nor
disregard
of
all
the
beauty
that
lay
outside
the
narrow
circle
of
comme
il
faut
comprised
the
whole
of
the
evil
which
the
idea
wrought
in
me
the
chief
evil
of
all
lay
in
the
notion
acquired
that
a
man
need
not
strive
to
become
a
tchinovnik
official
a
coachbuilder
a
soldier
a
savant
or
anything
useful
so
long
only
as
he
was
comme
il
faut
that
by
attaining
the
latter
quality
he
had
done
all
that
was
demanded
of
him
and
was
even
superior
to
most
people
usually
at
a
given
period
in
youth
and
after
many
errors
and
excesses
every
man
recognises
the
necessity
of
his
taking
an
active
part
in
social
life
and
chooses
some
branch
of
labour
to
which
to
devote
himself
only
with
the
comme
il
faut
man
does
this
rarely
happen
i
have
known
and
know
very
very
many
people
old
proud
and
opinionated
who
to
the
question
if
it
should
ever
present
itself
to
them
in
their
world
who
have
you
been
and
what
have
you
ever
done
would
be
unable
to
reply
otherwise
than
by
saying
je
fus
un
homme
tres
comme
il
faut
such
a
fate
was
awaiting
myself
xxxii
youth
despite
the
confusion
of
ideas
raging
in
my
head
i
was
at
least
young
innocent
and
free
that
summer
consequently
almost
happy
sometimes
i
would
rise
quite
early
in
the
morning
for
i
slept
on
the
open
verandah
and
the
bright
horizontal
beams
of
the
morning
sun
would
wake
me
up
dressing
myself
quickly
i
would
tuck
a
towel
and
a
french
novel
under
my
arm
and
go
off
to
bathe
in
the
river
in
the
shade
of
a
birch
tree
which
stood
half
a
verst
from
the
house
next
i
would
stretch
myself
on
the
grass
and
read
raising
my
eyes
from
time
to
time
to
look
at
the
surface
of
the
river
where
it
showed
blue
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
at
the
ripples
caused
by
the
first
morning
breeze
at
the
yellowing
field
of
rye
on
the
further
bank
and
at
the
sheen
of
the
sunlight
as
it
struck
lower
and
lower
down
the
white
trunks
of
the
which
ranged
in
ranks
one
behind
the
other
gradually
receded
into
the
remote
distance
of
the
home
park
at
such
moments
i
would
feel
joyously
conscious
of
having
within
me
the
same
young
fresh
force
of
life
as
nature
was
everywhere
exuding
around
me
when
however
the
sky
was
overcast
with
grey
clouds
of
morning
and
i
felt
chilly
after
bathing
i
would
often
start
to
walk
at
random
through
the
fields
and
woods
and
joyously
trail
my
wet
boots
in
the
fresh
dew
all
the
while
my
head
would
be
filled
with
vivid
dreams
concerning
the
heroes
of
my
novel
and
i
would
keep
picturing
to
myself
some
leader
of
an
army
or
some
statesman
or
marvellously
strong
man
or
devoted
lover
or
another
and
looking
round
me
in
a
nervous
expectation
that
i
should
suddenly
descry
her
somewhere
near
me
in
a
meadow
or
behind
a
tree
yet
whenever
these
rambles
led
me
near
peasants
engaged
at
their
work
all
my
ignoring
of
the
existence
of
the
common
people
did
not
prevent
me
from
experiencing
an
involuntary
overpowering
sensation
of
awkwardness
so
that
i
always
tried
to
avoid
their
seeing
me
when
the
heat
of
the
day
had
increased
it
was
not
infrequently
my
habit
if
the
ladies
did
not
come
out
of
doors
for
their
morning
tea
to
go
rambling
through
the
orchard
and
and
to
pluck
ripe
fruit
there
indeed
this
was
an
occupation
which
furnished
me
with
one
of
my
greatest
pleasures
let
any
one
go
into
an
orchard
and
dive
into
the
midst
of
a
tall
thick
sprouting
above
will
be
seen
the
clear
glowing
sky
and
all
around
the
prickly
stems
of
where
they
grow
mingled
together
in
a
tangle
of
profusion
at
one
s
feet
springs
the
nettle
with
its
slender
crown
of
flowers
while
the
burdock
with
its
prickly
blossoms
overtops
the
raspberries
and
even
one
s
head
with
its
luxuriant
masses
until
with
the
nettle
it
almost
meets
the
pendent
branches
of
the
old
where
apples
round
and
lustrous
as
bone
but
as
yet
unripe
are
mellowing
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
below
again
are
seen
young
twining
themselves
around
the
partially
withered
leafless
parent
plant
and
stretching
their
tendrils
towards
the
sunlight
with
green
blades
of
grass
and
young
pods
peering
through
last
year
s
leaves
and
growing
juicily
green
in
the
perennial
shade
as
though
they
care
nothing
for
the
bright
sunshine
which
is
playing
on
the
leaves
of
the
above
them
in
this
density
there
is
always
moisture
always
a
smell
of
confined
perpetual
shade
of
cobwebs
fallen
apples
turning
black
where
they
roll
on
the
mouldy
sod
raspberries
and
earwigs
of
the
kind
which
impel
one
to
reach
hastily
for
more
fruit
when
one
has
inadvertently
swallowed
a
member
of
that
insect
tribe
with
the
last
berry
at
every
step
one
s
movements
keep
flushing
the
sparrows
which
always
make
their
home
in
these
depths
and
one
hears
their
fussy
chirping
and
the
beating
of
their
tiny
fluttering
wings
against
the
stalks
and
catches
the
low
buzzing
of
a
bumble
bee
somewhere
and
the
sound
of
the
gardener
s
footsteps
it
is
akim
on
the
path
as
he
hums
his
eternal
to
himself
then
one
mutters
under
one
s
breath
no
neither
he
nor
any
one
else
shall
find
me
here
yet
still
one
goes
on
stripping
juicy
berries
from
their
conical
white
pilasters
and
cramming
them
into
one
s
mouth
at
length
one
s
legs
soaked
to
the
knees
as
one
repeats
over
and
over
again
some
rubbish
which
keeps
running
in
one
s
head
and
one
s
hands
and
nether
limbs
despite
the
protection
of
one
s
wet
trousers
thoroughly
stung
with
the
nettles
one
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
the
sun
s
rays
are
beating
too
straight
upon
one
s
head
for
eating
to
be
any
longer
desirable
and
sinking
down
into
the
tangle
of
greenery
one
remains
there
looking
and
listening
and
continuing
in
mechanical
fashion
to
strip
off
one
or
two
of
the
finer
berries
and
swallow
them
at
eleven
o
clock
that
is
to
say
when
the
ladies
had
taken
their
morning
tea
and
settled
down
to
their
occupations
i
would
repair
to
the
near
the
first
window
with
its
unbleached
linen
blind
lowered
to
exclude
the
sunshine
but
through
the
chink
of
which
the
sun
kept
throwing
brilliant
circles
of
light
which
hurt
the
eye
to
look
at
them
there
would
be
standing
a
screen
with
flies
quietly
parading
the
whiteness
of
its
covering
behind
it
would
be
seated
mimi
shaking
her
head
in
an
irritable
manner
and
constantly
shifting
from
spot
to
spot
to
avoid
the
sunshine
as
at
intervals
it
darted
her
from
somewhere
and
laid
a
streak
of
flame
upon
her
hand
or
face
through
the
other
three
windows
the
sun
would
be
throwing
three
squares
of
light
crossed
with
the
shadows
of
the
and
where
one
of
these
patches
marked
the
unstained
floor
of
the
room
there
would
be
lying
in
accordance
with
invariable
custom
milka
with
her
ears
pricked
as
she
watched
the
flies
promenading
the
lighted
space
seated
on
a
settee
katenka
would
be
knitting
or
reading
aloud
as
from
time
to
time
she
gave
her
white
sleeves
looking
almost
transparent
in
the
sunshine
an
impatient
shake
or
tossed
her
head
with
a
frown
to
drive
away
some
fly
which
had
settled
upon
her
thick
auburn
hair
and
was
now
buzzing
in
its
tangles
lubotshka
would
either
be
walking
up
and
down
the
room
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
until
the
moment
should
arrive
when
a
movement
would
be
made
towards
the
garden
or
playing
some
piece
of
which
every
note
had
long
been
familiar
to
me
for
my
own
part
i
would
sit
down
somewhere
and
listen
to
the
music
or
the
reading
until
such
time
as
i
myself
should
have
an
opportunity
of
performing
on
the
piano
after
luncheon
i
would
condescend
to
take
the
girls
out
riding
since
to
go
for
a
mere
walk
at
that
hour
seemed
to
me
unsuitable
to
my
years
and
position
in
the
world
and
these
excursions
of
ours
in
which
i
often
took
my
companions
through
unaccustomed
spots
and
dells
were
very
pleasant
indeed
on
some
of
these
occasions
i
grew
quite
boyish
and
the
girls
would
praise
my
riding
and
daring
and
pretend
that
i
was
their
protector
in
the
evening
if
we
had
no
guests
with
us
tea
served
in
the
dim
verandah
would
be
followed
by
a
walk
round
the
homestead
with
papa
and
then
i
would
stretch
myself
on
my
usual
settee
and
read
and
ponder
as
of
old
as
i
listened
to
katenka
or
lubotshka
playing
at
other
times
if
i
was
alone
in
the
and
lubotshka
was
performing
some
air
i
would
find
myself
laying
my
book
down
and
gazing
through
the
open
doorway
on
to
the
balcony
at
the
pendent
sinuous
branches
of
the
tall
where
they
stood
overshadowed
by
the
coming
night
and
at
the
clear
sky
where
if
one
looked
at
it
intently
enough
misty
yellowish
spots
would
appear
suddenly
and
then
disappear
again
next
as
i
listened
to
the
sounds
of
the
music
wafted
from
the
salon
and
to
the
creaking
of
gates
and
the
voices
of
the
peasant
women
when
the
cattle
returned
to
the
village
i
would
suddenly
bethink
me
of
natalia
savishna
and
of
mamma
and
of
karl
ivanitch
and
become
momentarily
sad
but
in
those
days
my
spirit
was
so
full
of
life
and
hope
that
such
reminiscences
only
touched
me
in
passing
and
soon
fled
away
again
after
supper
and
sometimes
a
night
stroll
with
some
one
in
the
garden
for
i
was
afraid
to
walk
down
the
dark
avenues
by
myself
i
would
repair
to
my
solitary
on
the
verandah
a
proceeding
which
despite
the
countless
mosquitos
which
always
devoured
me
afforded
me
the
greatest
pleasure
if
the
moon
was
full
i
frequently
spent
whole
nights
sitting
up
on
my
mattress
looking
at
the
light
and
shade
listening
to
the
sounds
or
stillness
dreaming
of
one
matter
and
another
but
more
particularly
of
the
poetic
voluptuous
happiness
which
in
those
days
i
believed
was
to
prove
the
acme
of
my
felicity
and
lamenting
that
until
now
it
had
only
been
given
to
me
to
imagine
things
no
sooner
had
every
one
dispersed
and
i
had
seen
lights
pass
from
the
to
the
upper
chambers
whence
female
voices
would
presently
be
heard
and
the
noise
of
windows
opening
and
shutting
than
i
would
depart
to
the
verandah
and
walk
up
and
down
there
as
i
listened
attentively
to
the
sounds
from
the
slumbering
mansion
to
this
day
whenever
i
feel
any
expectation
no
matter
how
small
and
baseless
of
realising
a
fraction
of
some
happiness
of
which
i
may
be
dreaming
i
somehow
invariably
fail
to
picture
to
myself
what
the
imagined
happiness
is
going
to
be
like
at
the
least
sound
of
bare
footsteps
or
of
a
cough
or
of
a
snore
or
of
the
rattling
of
a
window
or
of
the
rustling
of
a
dress
i
would
leap
from
my
mattress
and
stand
furtively
gazing
and
listening
thrown
without
any
visible
cause
into
extreme
agitation
but
the
lights
would
disappear
from
the
upper
rooms
the
sounds
of
footsteps
and
talking
give
place
to
snores
the
watchman
begin
his
nightly
tapping
with
his
stick
the
garden
grow
brighter
and
more
mysterious
as
the
streaks
of
light
vanished
from
the
windows
the
last
candle
pass
from
the
pantry
to
the
hall
throwing
a
glimmer
into
the
dewy
garden
as
it
did
so
and
the
stooping
figure
of
foka
decked
in
a
nightcap
and
carrying
the
candle
become
visible
to
my
eyes
as
he
went
to
his
bed
often
i
would
find
a
great
and
fearful
pleasure
in
stealing
over
the
grass
in
the
black
shadow
of
the
house
until
i
had
reached
the
hall
window
where
i
would
stand
listening
with
bated
breath
to
the
snoring
of
the
boy
to
foka
s
gruntings
in
the
belief
that
no
one
heard
him
and
to
the
sound
of
his
senile
voice
as
he
drawled
out
the
evening
prayers
at
length
even
his
candle
would
be
extinguished
and
the
window
slammed
down
so
that
i
would
find
myself
utterly
alone
whereupon
glancing
nervously
from
side
to
side
lest
haply
i
should
see
the
white
woman
standing
near
a
or
by
my
couch
i
would
run
at
full
speed
back
to
the
verandah
then
and
only
then
i
would
lie
down
with
my
face
to
the
garden
and
covering
myself
over
so
far
as
possible
from
the
mosquitos
and
bats
fall
to
gazing
in
front
of
me
as
i
listened
to
the
sounds
of
the
night
and
dreamed
of
love
and
happiness
at
such
times
everything
would
take
on
for
me
a
different
meaning
the
look
of
the
old
birch
trees
with
the
one
side
of
their
curling
branches
showing
bright
against
the
moonlit
sky
and
the
other
darkening
the
bushes
and
with
their
black
shadows
the
calm
rich
glitter
of
the
pond
ever
swelling
like
a
sound
the
moonlit
sparkle
of
the
dewdrops
on
the
flowers
in
front
of
the
verandah
the
graceful
shadows
of
those
flowers
where
they
lay
thrown
upon
the
grey
stonework
the
cry
of
a
quail
on
the
far
side
of
the
pond
the
voice
of
some
one
walking
on
the
high
road
the
quiet
scarcely
audible
scrunching
of
two
old
birch
trees
against
one
another
the
humming
of
a
mosquito
at
my
car
under
the
coverlet
the
fall
of
an
apple
as
it
caught
against
a
branch
and
rustled
among
the
dry
leaves
the
leapings
of
frogs
as
they
approached
almost
to
the
and
sat
with
the
moon
shining
mysteriously
on
their
green
backs
all
these
things
took
on
for
me
a
strange
significance
a
significance
of
exceeding
beauty
and
of
infinite
love
before
me
would
rise
she
with
long
black
tresses
and
a
high
bust
but
always
mournful
in
her
fairness
with
bare
hands
and
voluptuous
arms
she
loved
me
and
for
one
moment
of
her
love
i
would
sacrifice
my
whole
life
but
the
moon
would
go
on
rising
higher
and
higher
and
shining
brighter
and
brighter
in
the
heavens
the
rich
sparkle
of
the
pond
would
swell
like
a
sound
and
become
ever
more
and
more
brilliant
while
the
shadows
would
grow
blacker
and
blacker
and
the
sheen
of
the
moon
more
and
more
transparent
until
as
i
looked
at
and
listened
to
all
this
something
would
say
to
me
that
she
with
the
bare
hands
and
voluptuous
arms
did
not
represent
all
happiness
that
love
for
her
did
not
represent
all
good
so
that
the
more
i
gazed
at
the
full
moon
the
higher
would
true
beauty
and
goodness
appear
to
me
to
lie
and
the
purer
and
purer
they
would
seem
the
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
who
is
the
source
of
all
beauty
and
all
goodness
and
tears
of
a
sort
of
unsatisfied
yet
tumultuous
joy
would
fill
my
eyes
always
too
i
was
alone
yet
always
too
it
seemed
to
me
that
although
great
mysterious
nature
could
draw
the
shining
disc
of
the
moon
to
herself
and
somehow
hold
in
some
high
indefinite
place
the
sky
and
be
everywhere
around
me
and
fill
of
herself
the
infinity
of
space
while
i
was
but
a
lowly
worm
already
defiled
with
the
poor
petty
passions
of
humanity
always
it
seemed
to
me
that
nevertheless
both
nature
and
the
moon
and
i
were
one
xxxiii
our
neighbours
on
the
first
day
after
our
arrival
i
had
been
greatly
astonished
that
papa
should
speak
of
our
neighbours
the
epifanovs
as
nice
people
and
still
more
so
that
he
should
go
to
call
upon
them
the
fact
was
that
we
had
long
been
at
law
over
some
land
with
this
family
when
a
child
i
had
more
than
once
heard
papa
raging
over
the
litigation
abusing
the
epifanovs
and
warning
people
so
i
understood
him
against
them
likewise
i
had
heard
jakoff
speak
of
them
as
our
enemies
and
black
people
and
could
remember
mamma
requesting
that
their
names
should
never
be
mentioned
in
her
presence
nor
indeed
in
the
house
at
all
from
these
data
i
as
a
child
had
arrived
at
the
clear
and
assured
conviction
that
the
epifanovs
were
foemen
of
ours
who
would
at
any
time
stab
or
strangle
both
papa
and
his
sons
if
they
should
ever
come
across
them
as
well
as
that
they
were
black
people
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
term
consequently
when
in
the
year
that
mamma
died
i
chanced
to
catch
sight
of
avdotia
la
belle
flamande
on
the
occasion
of
a
visit
which
she
paid
to
my
mother
i
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
she
did
not
come
of
a
family
of
negroes
all
the
same
i
had
the
lowest
possible
opinion
of
the
family
and
for
all
that
we
saw
much
of
them
that
summer
continued
to
be
strongly
prejudiced
against
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
their
household
only
consisted
of
the
mother
a
widow
of
fifty
but
a
very
cheery
old
woman
a
beautiful
daughter
named
avdotia
and
a
son
peter
who
was
a
stammerer
unmarried
and
of
very
serious
disposition
for
the
last
twenty
years
before
her
husband
s
death
madame
epifanov
had
lived
apart
from
him
sometimes
in
petersburg
where
she
had
relatives
but
more
frequently
at
her
village
of
mitishtchi
which
stood
some
three
versts
from
ours
yet
the
neighbourhood
had
taken
to
circulating
such
horrible
tales
concerning
her
mode
of
life
that
messalina
was
by
comparison
a
blameless
child
which
was
why
my
mother
had
requested
her
name
never
to
be
mentioned
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
part
of
the
most
cruel
of
all
gossip
the
gossip
of
is
worthy
of
credence
and
although
when
i
first
made
madame
s
acquaintance
she
had
living
with
her
in
the
house
a
clerk
named
mitusha
who
had
been
promoted
from
a
serf
and
who
curled
pomaded
and
dressed
in
a
frockcoat
of
circassian
pattern
always
stood
behind
his
mistress
s
chair
at
luncheon
while
from
time
to
time
she
invited
her
guests
to
admire
his
handsome
eyes
and
mouth
there
was
nothing
for
gossip
to
take
hold
of
i
believe
too
that
since
the
time
ten
years
earlier
when
she
had
recalled
her
dutiful
son
peter
from
the
service
she
had
wholly
changed
her
mode
of
living
it
seems
her
property
had
never
been
a
large
one
merely
a
hundred
souls
or
so
this
refers
of
course
to
the
days
of
serfdom
and
that
during
her
previous
life
of
gaiety
she
had
spent
a
great
deal
consequently
when
some
ten
years
ago
those
portions
of
the
property
which
had
been
mortgaged
and
had
been
foreclosed
upon
and
compulsorily
sold
by
auction
she
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
all
these
unpleasant
details
of
distress
upon
and
valuation
of
her
property
had
been
due
not
so
much
to
failure
to
pay
the
interest
as
to
the
fact
that
she
was
a
woman
wherefore
she
had
written
to
her
son
then
serving
with
his
regiment
to
come
and
save
his
mother
from
her
embarrassments
and
he
like
a
dutiful
son
conceiving
that
his
first
duty
was
to
comfort
his
mother
in
her
old
age
had
straightway
resigned
his
commission
for
all
that
he
had
been
doing
well
in
his
profession
and
was
hoping
soon
to
become
independent
and
had
come
to
join
her
in
the
country
despite
his
plain
face
uncouth
demeanour
and
fault
of
stuttering
peter
was
a
man
of
unswerving
principles
and
of
the
most
extraordinary
good
sense
somehow
by
small
borrowings
sundry
strokes
of
business
petitions
for
grace
and
promises
to
repay
he
contrived
to
carry
on
the
property
and
making
himself
overseer
donned
his
father
s
greatcoat
still
preserved
in
a
drawer
dispensed
with
horses
and
carriages
discouraged
guests
from
calling
at
mitishtchi
fashioned
his
own
sleighs
increased
his
arable
land
and
curtailed
that
of
the
serfs
felled
his
own
timber
sold
his
produce
in
person
and
saw
to
matters
generally
indeed
he
swore
and
kept
his
oath
that
until
all
outstanding
debts
were
paid
he
would
never
wear
any
clothes
than
his
father
s
greatcoat
and
a
corduroy
jacket
which
he
had
made
for
himself
nor
yet
ride
in
aught
but
a
country
waggon
drawn
by
peasants
horses
this
stoical
mode
of
life
he
sought
to
apply
also
to
his
family
so
far
as
the
sympathetic
respect
which
he
conceived
to
be
his
mother
s
due
would
allow
of
so
that
although
in
the
he
would
show
her
only
stuttering
servility
and
fulfil
all
her
wishes
and
blame
any
one
who
did
not
do
precisely
as
she
bid
them
in
his
study
or
his
office
he
would
overhaul
the
cook
if
she
had
served
up
so
much
as
a
duck
without
his
orders
or
any
one
responsible
for
sending
a
serf
even
though
at
madame
s
own
bidding
to
inquire
after
a
neighbour
s
health
or
for
despatching
the
peasant
girls
into
the
wood
to
gather
wild
raspberries
instead
of
setting
them
to
weed
the
within
four
years
every
debt
had
been
repaid
and
peter
had
gone
to
moscow
and
returned
thence
in
a
new
jacket
and
tarantass
a
carriage
yet
despite
this
flourishing
position
of
affairs
he
still
preserved
the
stoical
tendencies
in
which
to
tell
the
truth
he
took
a
certain
vague
pride
before
his
family
and
strangers
since
he
would
frequently
say
with
a
stutter
any
one
who
really
wishes
to
see
me
will
be
glad
to
see
me
even
in
my
and
to
eat
nothing
but
shtchi
and
kasha
buckwheat
gruel
at
my
that
is
what
i
eat
myself
he
would
add
in
his
every
word
and
movement
spoke
pride
based
upon
a
consciousness
of
having
sacrificed
himself
for
his
mother
and
redeemed
the
property
as
well
as
contempt
for
any
one
who
had
not
done
something
of
the
same
kind
the
mother
and
daughter
were
altogether
different
characters
from
peter
as
well
as
altogether
different
from
one
another
the
former
was
one
of
the
most
agreeable
uniformly
and
cheerful
women
whom
one
could
possibly
meet
anything
attractive
and
genuinely
happy
delighted
her
even
the
faculty
of
being
pleased
with
the
sight
of
young
people
enjoying
themselves
it
is
only
in
the
of
elderly
folk
that
one
meets
with
that
trait
she
possessed
to
the
full
on
the
other
hand
her
daughter
was
of
a
grave
turn
of
mind
rather
she
was
of
that
peculiarly
careless
gratuitously
distant
bearing
which
commonly
distinguishes
unmarried
beauties
whenever
she
tried
to
be
gay
her
gaiety
somehow
seemed
to
be
unnatural
to
her
so
that
she
always
appeared
to
be
laughing
either
at
herself
or
at
the
persons
to
whom
she
was
speaking
or
at
the
world
in
general
a
thing
which
possibly
she
had
no
real
intention
of
doing
often
i
asked
myself
in
astonishment
what
she
could
mean
when
she
said
something
like
yes
i
know
how
terribly
i
am
or
of
course
every
one
is
in
love
with
me
and
so
forth
her
mother
was
a
person
always
busy
since
she
had
a
passion
for
housekeeping
gardening
flowers
canaries
and
pretty
trinkets
her
rooms
and
garden
it
is
true
were
small
and
poorly
yet
everything
in
them
was
so
neat
and
methodical
and
bore
such
a
general
air
of
that
gentle
gaiety
which
one
hears
expressed
in
a
waltz
or
polka
that
the
word
toy
by
which
guests
often
expressed
their
praise
of
it
all
exactly
suited
her
surroundings
she
herself
was
a
toy
being
petite
slender
small
and
and
invariably
gay
and
the
only
fault
in
her
was
that
a
slight
of
the
veins
on
her
little
hands
rather
marred
the
general
effect
of
her
appearance
on
the
other
hand
her
daughter
scarcely
ever
did
anything
at
all
not
only
had
she
no
love
for
trifling
with
flowers
and
trinkets
but
she
neglected
her
personal
exterior
and
only
troubled
to
dress
herself
well
when
guests
happened
to
call
yet
on
returning
to
the
room
in
society
costume
she
always
looked
extremely
handsome
save
for
that
cold
uniform
expression
of
eyes
and
smile
which
is
common
to
all
beauties
in
fact
her
strictly
regular
beautiful
face
and
symmetrical
figure
always
seemed
to
be
saying
to
you
yes
you
may
look
at
at
the
same
time
for
all
the
mother
s
liveliness
of
disposition
and
the
daughter
s
air
of
indifference
and
abstraction
something
told
one
that
the
former
was
incapable
of
feeling
affection
for
anything
that
was
not
pretty
and
gay
but
that
avdotia
on
the
contrary
was
one
of
those
natures
which
once
they
love
are
willing
to
sacrifice
their
whole
life
for
the
man
they
adore
xxxiv
my
father
s
second
marriage
my
father
was
when
he
took
as
his
second
wife
avdotia
vassilievna
epifanov
i
suspect
that
when
that
spring
he
had
departed
for
the
country
with
the
girls
he
had
been
in
that
communicatively
happy
sociable
mood
in
which
gamblers
usually
find
themselves
who
have
retired
from
play
after
winning
large
stakes
he
had
felt
that
he
still
had
a
fortune
left
to
him
which
so
long
as
he
did
not
squander
it
on
gaming
might
be
used
for
our
advancement
in
life
moreover
it
was
springtime
he
was
unexpectedly
well
supplied
with
ready
money
he
was
alone
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
as
he
conversed
with
jakoff
on
various
matters
and
remembered
both
the
interminable
suit
with
the
epifanovs
and
avdotia
s
beauty
it
was
a
long
while
since
he
had
seen
her
i
can
imagine
him
saying
how
do
you
think
we
ought
to
act
in
this
suit
jakoff
my
idea
is
simply
to
let
the
cursed
land
go
eh
what
do
you
think
about
it
i
can
imagine
too
how
thus
interrogated
jakoff
twirled
his
fingers
behind
his
back
in
a
deprecatory
sort
of
way
and
proceeded
to
argue
that
it
all
the
same
peter
alexandritch
we
are
in
the
nevertheless
i
further
conjecture
papa
ordered
the
dogcart
to
be
got
ready
put
on
his
fashionable
brushed
up
the
remnants
of
his
hair
sprinkled
his
clothes
with
scent
and
greatly
pleased
to
think
that
he
was
acting
a
la
seignior
as
well
as
even
more
revelling
in
the
prospect
of
soon
seeing
a
pretty
woman
drove
off
to
visit
his
neighbours
i
can
imagine
too
that
when
the
flustered
housemaid
ran
to
inform
peter
vassilievitch
that
monsieur
irtenieff
himself
had
called
peter
answered
angrily
well
what
has
he
come
for
and
stepping
softly
about
the
house
first
went
into
his
study
to
put
on
his
old
soiled
jacket
and
then
sent
down
word
to
the
cook
that
on
no
account
whatever
no
not
even
if
she
were
ordered
to
do
so
by
the
mistress
herself
was
she
to
add
anything
to
luncheon
since
later
i
often
saw
papa
with
peter
i
can
form
a
very
good
idea
of
this
first
interview
between
them
i
can
imagine
that
despite
papa
s
proposal
to
end
the
suit
in
a
peaceful
manner
peter
was
morose
and
resentful
at
the
thought
of
having
sacrificed
his
career
to
his
mother
and
at
papa
having
done
nothing
of
the
kind
a
by
no
means
surprising
circumstance
peter
probably
said
to
himself
next
i
can
see
papa
taking
no
notice
of
this
but
cracking
quips
and
jests
while
peter
gradually
found
himself
forced
to
treat
him
as
a
humorist
with
whom
he
felt
offended
one
moment
and
inclined
to
be
reconciled
the
next
indeed
with
his
instinct
for
making
fun
of
everything
papa
often
used
to
address
peter
as
colonel
and
though
i
can
remember
peter
once
replying
with
an
unusually
violent
stutter
and
his
face
scarlet
with
indignation
that
he
had
never
been
a
but
only
a
papa
called
him
colonel
again
before
another
five
minutes
were
out
lubotshka
told
me
that
up
to
the
time
of
woloda
s
and
my
arrival
from
moscow
there
had
been
daily
meetings
with
the
epifanovs
and
that
things
had
been
very
lively
since
papa
who
had
a
genius
for
arranging
everything
with
a
touch
of
originality
and
wit
as
well
as
in
a
simple
and
refined
manner
had
devised
shooting
and
fishing
parties
and
fireworks
for
the
epifanovs
benefit
all
these
festivities
so
said
lubotshka
would
have
gone
off
splendidly
but
for
the
intolerable
peter
who
had
spoilt
everything
by
his
puffing
and
stuttering
after
our
coming
however
the
epifanovs
only
visited
us
twice
and
we
went
once
to
their
house
while
after
peter
s
day
on
which
it
being
papa
s
nameday
the
epifanovs
called
upon
us
in
common
with
a
crowd
of
other
guests
our
relations
with
that
family
came
entirely
to
an
end
and
in
future
only
papa
went
to
see
them
during
the
brief
period
when
i
had
opportunities
of
seeing
papa
and
dunetchka
as
her
mother
called
avdotia
together
this
is
what
i
remarked
about
them
papa
remained
unceasingly
in
the
same
buoyant
mood
as
had
so
greatly
struck
me
on
the
day
after
our
arrival
so
gay
and
youthful
and
full
of
life
and
happy
did
he
seem
that
the
beams
of
his
felicity
extended
themselves
to
all
around
him
and
involuntarily
communicated
to
them
a
similar
frame
of
mind
he
never
stirred
from
avdotia
s
side
so
long
as
she
was
in
the
room
but
either
kept
on
plying
her
with
compliments
which
made
me
feel
ashamed
for
him
or
with
his
gaze
fixed
upon
her
with
an
air
at
once
passionate
and
complacent
sat
hitching
his
shoulder
and
coughing
as
from
time
to
time
he
smiled
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
yet
throughout
he
wore
the
same
expression
of
raillery
as
was
peculiar
to
him
even
in
the
most
serious
matters
as
a
rule
avdotia
herself
seemed
to
catch
the
infection
of
the
happiness
which
sparkled
at
this
period
in
papa
s
large
blue
eyes
yet
there
were
moments
also
when
she
would
be
seized
with
such
a
fit
of
shyness
that
i
who
knew
the
feeling
well
was
full
of
sympathy
and
compassion
as
i
regarded
her
embarrassment
at
moments
of
this
kind
she
seemed
to
be
afraid
of
every
glance
and
every
movement
to
be
supposing
that
every
one
was
looking
at
her
every
one
thinking
of
no
one
but
her
and
that
unfavourably
she
would
glance
timidly
from
one
person
to
another
the
colour
coming
and
going
in
her
cheeks
and
then
begin
to
talk
loudly
and
defiantly
but
for
the
most
part
nonsense
until
presently
realising
this
and
supposing
that
papa
and
every
one
else
had
heard
her
she
would
blush
more
painfully
than
ever
yet
papa
never
noticed
her
nonsense
for
he
was
too
much
taken
up
with
coughing
and
with
gazing
at
her
with
his
look
of
happy
triumphant
devotion
i
noticed
too
that
although
these
fits
of
shyness
attacked
avdotia
without
any
visible
cause
they
not
infrequently
ensued
upon
papa
s
mention
of
one
or
another
young
and
beautiful
woman
frequent
transitions
from
depression
to
that
strange
awkward
gaiety
of
hers
to
which
i
have
referred
before
the
repetition
of
favourite
words
and
turns
of
speech
of
papa
s
the
continuation
of
discussions
with
others
which
papa
had
already
begun
all
these
things
if
my
father
had
not
been
the
principal
actor
in
the
matter
and
i
had
been
a
little
older
would
have
explained
to
me
the
relations
subsisting
between
him
and
avdotia
at
the
time
however
i
never
surmised
them
no
not
even
when
papa
received
from
her
brother
peter
a
letter
which
so
upset
him
that
not
again
until
the
end
of
august
did
he
go
to
call
upon
the
epifanovs
then
however
he
began
his
visits
once
more
and
ended
by
informing
us
on
the
day
before
woloda
and
i
were
to
return
to
moscow
that
he
was
about
to
take
avdotia
vassilievna
epifanov
to
be
his
wife
xxxv
how
we
received
the
news
yet
even
on
the
eve
of
the
official
announcement
every
one
had
learnt
of
the
matter
and
was
discussing
it
mimi
never
left
her
room
that
day
and
wept
copiously
katenka
kept
her
company
and
only
came
out
for
luncheon
with
a
grieved
expression
on
her
face
which
was
manifestly
borrowed
from
her
mother
lubotshka
on
the
contrary
was
very
cheerful
and
told
us
after
luncheon
that
she
knew
of
a
splendid
secret
which
she
was
going
to
tell
no
one
there
is
nothing
so
splendid
about
your
secret
said
woloda
who
did
not
in
the
least
share
her
satisfaction
if
you
were
capable
of
any
serious
thought
at
all
you
would
understand
that
it
is
a
very
bad
lookout
for
lubotshka
stared
at
him
in
amazement
and
said
no
more
after
the
meal
was
over
woloda
made
a
feint
of
taking
me
by
the
arm
and
then
fearing
that
this
would
seem
too
much
like
affection
nudged
me
gently
by
the
elbow
and
beckoned
me
towards
the
salon
you
know
i
suppose
what
the
secret
is
of
which
lubotshka
was
speaking
he
said
when
he
was
sure
that
we
were
alone
it
was
seldom
that
he
and
i
spoke
together
in
confidence
with
the
result
that
whenever
it
came
about
we
felt
a
kind
of
awkwardness
in
one
another
s
presence
and
boys
began
to
jump
about
in
our
eyes
as
woloda
expressed
it
on
the
present
occasion
however
he
answered
the
excitement
in
my
eyes
with
a
grave
fixed
look
which
said
you
need
not
be
surprised
for
we
are
brothers
and
we
have
to
consider
an
important
family
i
understood
him
and
he
went
on
you
know
i
suppose
that
papa
is
going
to
marry
avdotia
epifanov
i
nodded
for
i
had
already
heard
so
well
it
is
not
a
good
thing
continued
woloda
why
so
why
he
repeated
irritably
because
it
will
be
so
pleasant
won
t
it
to
have
this
stuttering
colonel
and
all
his
family
for
relations
certainly
she
seems
nice
enough
as
yet
but
who
knows
what
she
will
turn
out
to
be
later
it
won
t
matter
much
to
you
or
myself
but
lubotshka
will
soon
be
making
her
debut
and
it
will
hardly
be
nice
for
her
to
have
such
a
belle
mere
as
this
a
woman
who
speaks
french
badly
and
has
no
manners
to
teach
although
it
seemed
odd
to
hear
woloda
criticising
papa
s
choice
so
coolly
i
felt
that
he
was
right
why
is
he
marrying
her
i
asked
oh
it
is
a
business
and
god
only
knows
why
he
answered
all
i
know
is
that
her
brother
peter
tried
to
make
conditions
about
the
marriage
and
that
although
at
first
papa
would
not
hear
of
them
he
afterwards
took
some
fancy
or
or
another
into
his
head
but
as
i
say
it
is
a
business
i
am
only
just
beginning
to
understand
my
father
the
fact
that
woloda
called
papa
my
father
instead
of
papa
somehow
hurt
me
and
though
i
can
see
that
he
is
kind
and
clever
he
is
irresponsible
and
frivolous
to
a
degree
that
well
the
whole
thing
is
astonishing
he
can
not
so
much
as
look
upon
a
woman
calmly
you
yourself
know
how
he
falls
in
love
with
every
one
that
he
meets
you
know
it
and
so
does
what
do
you
mean
i
said
what
i
say
not
long
ago
i
learnt
that
he
used
to
be
in
love
with
mimi
herself
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
that
he
used
to
send
her
poetry
and
that
there
really
was
something
between
them
mimi
is
about
it
to
this
day
and
woloda
burst
out
laughing
impossible
i
cried
in
astonishment
but
the
principal
thing
at
this
moment
went
on
woloda
becoming
serious
again
and
relapsing
into
french
is
to
think
how
delighted
all
our
relations
will
be
with
this
marriage
why
she
will
probably
have
children
woloda
s
prudence
and
forethought
struck
me
so
forcibly
that
i
had
no
answer
to
make
just
at
this
moment
lubotshka
approached
us
so
you
know
she
said
with
a
joyful
face
yes
said
woloda
still
i
am
surprised
at
you
lubotshka
you
are
no
longer
a
baby
in
long
clothes
why
should
you
be
so
pleased
because
papa
is
going
to
marry
a
piece
of
trash
at
this
lubotshka
s
face
fell
and
she
became
serious
oh
woloda
she
exclaimed
why
a
piece
of
trash
indeed
how
can
you
dare
to
speak
of
avdotia
like
that
if
papa
is
going
to
marry
her
she
can
not
be
no
not
trash
so
to
speak
but
no
buts
at
all
interrupted
lubotshka
flaring
up
you
have
never
heard
me
call
the
girl
whom
you
are
in
love
with
trash
how
then
can
you
speak
so
of
papa
and
a
respectable
woman
although
you
are
my
elder
brother
i
won
t
allow
you
to
speak
like
that
you
ought
not
to
mayn
t
i
even
express
an
opinion
about
no
you
mayn
t
repeated
lubotshka
no
one
ought
to
criticise
such
a
father
as
ours
mimi
has
the
right
to
but
not
you
however
much
you
may
be
the
eldest
oh
you
don
t
understand
anything
said
woloda
contemptuously
try
and
do
so
how
can
it
be
a
good
thing
that
a
dunetchka
of
an
epifanov
should
take
the
place
of
our
dead
mamma
for
a
moment
lubotshka
was
silent
then
the
tears
suddenly
came
into
her
eyes
i
knew
that
you
were
conceited
but
i
never
thought
that
you
could
be
cruel
she
said
and
left
us
pshaw
said
woloda
pulling
a
face
and
stupid
eyes
that
s
what
comes
of
arguing
with
evidently
he
felt
that
he
was
at
fault
in
having
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
descend
to
discuss
matters
at
all
with
lubotshka
next
day
the
weather
was
bad
and
neither
papa
nor
the
ladies
had
come
down
to
morning
tea
when
i
entered
the
there
had
been
cold
rain
in
the
night
and
remnants
of
the
clouds
from
which
it
had
descended
were
still
scudding
across
the
sky
with
the
sun
s
luminous
disc
not
yet
risen
to
any
great
height
showing
faintly
through
them
it
was
a
windy
damp
grey
morning
the
door
into
the
garden
was
standing
open
and
pools
left
by
the
night
s
rain
were
drying
on
the
flags
of
the
terrace
the
open
door
was
swinging
on
its
iron
hinges
in
the
wind
and
all
the
paths
looked
wet
and
muddy
the
old
birch
trees
with
their
naked
white
branches
the
bushes
the
turf
the
nettles
the
the
elders
with
the
pale
side
of
their
leaves
turned
upwards
all
were
dashing
themselves
about
and
looking
as
though
they
were
trying
to
wrench
themselves
free
from
their
roots
from
the
avenue
of
showers
of
round
yellow
leaves
were
flying
through
the
air
in
tossing
eddying
circles
and
strewing
the
wet
road
and
soaked
aftermath
of
the
hayfield
with
a
clammy
carpet
at
the
moment
my
thoughts
were
wholly
taken
up
with
my
father
s
approaching
marriage
and
with
the
point
of
view
from
which
woloda
regarded
it
the
future
seemed
to
me
to
bode
no
good
for
any
of
us
i
felt
distressed
to
think
that
a
woman
who
was
not
only
a
stranger
but
young
should
be
going
to
associate
with
us
in
so
many
relations
of
life
without
having
any
right
to
do
so
nay
that
this
young
woman
was
going
to
usurp
the
place
of
our
dead
mother
i
felt
depressed
and
kept
thinking
more
and
more
that
my
father
was
to
blame
in
the
matter
presently
i
heard
his
voice
and
woloda
s
speaking
together
in
the
pantry
and
not
wishing
to
meet
papa
just
then
had
just
left
the
room
when
i
was
pursued
by
lubotshka
who
said
that
papa
wanted
to
see
me
he
was
standing
in
the
with
his
hand
resting
on
the
piano
and
was
gazing
in
my
direction
with
an
air
at
once
grave
and
impatient
his
face
no
longer
wore
the
youthful
gay
expression
which
had
struck
me
for
so
long
but
on
the
contrary
looked
sad
woloda
was
walking
about
the
room
with
a
pipe
in
his
hand
i
approached
my
father
and
bade
him
good
morning
well
my
children
he
said
firmly
with
a
lift
of
his
head
and
in
the
peculiarly
hurried
manner
of
one
who
wishes
to
announce
something
obviously
unwelcome
but
no
longer
admitting
of
reconsideration
you
know
i
suppose
that
i
am
going
to
marry
avdotia
he
paused
a
moment
hitherto
i
had
had
no
desire
for
any
one
to
succeed
your
mother
but
and
again
he
paused
is
evidently
my
fate
dunetchka
is
an
excellent
kind
girl
and
no
longer
in
her
first
youth
i
hope
therefore
my
children
that
you
will
like
her
and
she
i
know
will
be
sincerely
fond
of
you
for
she
is
a
good
woman
and
now
he
went
on
addressing
himself
more
particularly
to
woloda
and
myself
and
having
the
appearance
of
speaking
hurriedly
in
order
to
prevent
us
from
interrupting
him
it
is
time
for
you
to
depart
while
i
myself
am
going
to
stay
here
until
the
new
year
and
then
to
follow
you
to
moscow
with
again
he
hesitated
a
moment
my
wife
and
it
hurt
me
to
see
my
father
standing
as
though
abashed
and
at
fault
before
us
so
i
moved
a
little
nearer
him
but
woloda
only
went
on
walking
about
the
room
with
his
head
down
and
smoking
so
my
children
that
is
what
your
old
father
has
planned
to
do
concluded
papa
reddening
coughing
and
offering
woloda
and
myself
his
hands
tears
were
in
his
eyes
as
he
said
this
and
i
noticed
too
that
the
hand
which
he
was
holding
out
to
woloda
who
at
that
moment
chanced
to
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
was
shaking
slightly
the
sight
of
that
shaking
hand
gave
me
an
unpleasant
shock
for
i
remembered
that
papa
had
served
in
and
had
been
as
every
one
knew
a
brave
officer
seizing
the
great
veiny
hand
i
covered
it
with
kisses
and
he
squeezed
mine
hard
in
return
then
with
a
sob
amid
his
tears
he
suddenly
threw
his
arms
around
lubotshka
s
dark
head
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
on
the
eyes
woloda
pretended
that
he
had
dropped
his
pipe
and
bending
down
wiped
his
eyes
furtively
with
the
back
of
his
hand
then
endeavouring
to
escape
notice
he
left
the
room
xxxvi
the
university
the
wedding
was
to
take
place
in
two
weeks
time
but
as
our
lectures
had
begun
already
woloda
and
myself
were
forced
to
return
to
moscow
at
the
beginning
of
september
the
nechludoffs
had
also
returned
from
the
country
and
dimitri
with
whom
on
parting
i
had
made
an
agreement
that
we
should
correspond
frequently
with
the
result
of
course
that
we
had
never
once
written
to
one
another
came
to
see
us
immediately
after
our
arrival
and
arranged
to
escort
me
to
my
first
lecture
on
the
morrow
it
was
a
beautiful
sunny
day
no
sooner
had
i
entered
the
auditorium
than
i
felt
my
personality
entirely
disappear
amid
the
swarm
of
youths
who
were
seething
tumultuously
through
every
doorway
and
corridor
under
the
influence
of
the
sunlight
pouring
through
the
great
windows
i
found
the
sense
of
being
a
member
of
this
huge
community
very
pleasing
yet
there
were
few
among
the
throng
whom
i
knew
and
that
only
on
terms
of
a
nod
and
a
how
do
you
do
irtenieff
all
around
me
men
were
shaking
hands
and
chatting
together
from
every
side
came
expressions
of
friendship
laughter
jests
and
badinage
everywhere
i
could
feel
the
tie
which
bound
this
youthful
society
in
one
and
everywhere
too
i
could
feel
that
it
left
me
out
yet
this
impression
lasted
for
a
moment
only
and
was
succeeded
together
with
the
vexation
which
it
had
caused
by
the
idea
that
it
was
best
that
i
should
not
belong
to
that
society
but
keep
to
my
own
circle
of
gentlemen
wherefore
i
proceeded
to
seat
myself
upon
the
third
bench
with
as
neighbours
count
baron
the
prince
iwin
and
some
other
young
men
of
the
same
class
with
none
of
whom
however
was
acquainted
save
with
iwin
and
count
b
yet
the
look
which
these
young
gentlemen
threw
at
me
at
once
made
me
feel
that
i
was
not
of
their
set
and
i
turned
to
observe
what
was
going
on
around
me
semenoff
with
grey
matted
hair
white
teeth
and
tunic
flying
open
was
seated
a
little
distance
off
and
leaning
forward
on
his
elbows
as
he
nibbled
a
pen
while
the
gymnasium
student
who
had
come
out
first
in
the
examinations
had
established
himself
on
the
front
bench
and
with
a
black
stock
coming
up
his
cheek
was
toying
with
the
silver
which
adorned
his
satin
waistcoat
on
a
bench
in
a
raised
part
of
the
hall
i
could
descry
ikonin
evidently
he
had
contrived
to
enter
the
university
somehow
and
hear
him
fussily
proclaiming
in
all
the
glory
of
blue
piped
trousers
which
completely
hid
his
boots
that
he
was
now
seated
on
parnassus
ilinka
who
had
surprised
me
by
giving
me
a
bow
not
only
cold
but
supercilious
as
though
to
remind
me
that
here
we
were
all
equals
was
just
in
front
of
me
with
his
legs
resting
in
free
and
easy
style
on
another
bench
a
hit
somehow
i
thought
at
myself
and
conversing
with
a
student
as
he
threw
occasional
glances
in
my
direction
iwin
s
set
by
my
side
were
talking
in
french
yet
every
word
which
i
overheard
of
their
conversation
seemed
to
me
both
stupid
and
incorrect
ce
n
est
pas
francais
i
thought
to
myself
while
all
the
attitudes
utterances
and
doings
of
semenoff
ilinka
and
the
rest
struck
me
as
uniformly
coarse
ungentlemanly
and
comme
il
ne
faut
thus
attached
to
no
particular
set
i
felt
isolated
and
unable
to
make
friends
and
so
grew
resentful
one
of
the
students
on
the
bench
in
front
of
me
kept
biting
his
nails
which
were
raw
to
the
quick
already
and
this
so
disgusted
me
that
i
edged
away
from
him
in
short
i
remember
finding
my
first
day
a
most
depressing
affair
when
the
professor
entered
and
there
was
a
general
stir
and
a
cessation
of
chatter
i
remember
throwing
a
scornful
glance
at
him
as
also
that
he
began
his
discourse
with
a
sentence
which
i
thought
devoid
of
meaning
i
had
expected
the
lecture
to
be
from
first
to
last
so
clever
that
not
a
word
ought
to
be
taken
from
or
added
to
it
disappointed
in
this
i
at
once
proceeded
to
draw
beneath
the
heading
first
lecture
with
which
i
had
adorned
my
notebook
no
less
than
eighteen
faces
in
profile
joined
together
in
a
sort
of
chaplet
and
only
occasionally
moved
my
hand
along
the
page
in
order
to
give
the
professor
who
i
felt
sure
must
be
greatly
interested
in
me
the
impression
that
i
was
writing
something
in
fact
at
this
very
first
lecture
i
came
to
the
decision
which
i
maintained
to
the
end
of
my
course
namely
that
it
was
unnecessary
and
even
stupid
to
take
down
every
word
said
by
every
professor
at
subsequent
lectures
however
i
did
not
feel
my
isolation
so
strongly
since
i
made
several
acquaintances
and
got
into
the
way
of
shaking
hands
and
entering
into
conversation
yet
for
some
reason
or
another
no
real
intimacy
ever
sprang
up
between
us
and
i
often
found
myself
depressed
and
only
feigning
cheerfulness
with
the
set
which
comprised
iwin
and
the
aristocrats
as
they
were
generally
known
i
could
not
make
any
headway
at
all
for
as
i
now
remember
i
was
always
shy
and
churlish
to
them
and
nodded
to
them
only
when
they
nodded
to
me
so
that
they
had
little
inducement
to
desire
my
acquaintance
with
most
of
the
other
students
however
this
arose
from
quite
a
different
cause
as
soon
as
ever
i
discerned
friendliness
on
the
part
of
a
comrade
i
at
once
gave
him
to
understand
that
i
went
to
luncheon
with
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
and
kept
my
own
drozhki
all
this
i
said
merely
to
show
myself
in
the
most
favourable
light
in
his
eyes
and
to
induce
him
to
like
me
all
the
more
yet
almost
invariably
the
only
result
of
my
communicating
to
him
the
intelligence
concerning
the
drozhki
and
my
relationship
to
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
was
that
to
my
astonishment
he
at
once
adopted
a
cold
and
haughty
bearing
towards
me
among
us
we
had
a
crown
student
named
operoff
a
very
modest
industrious
and
clever
young
fellow
who
always
offered
one
his
hand
like
a
slab
of
wood
that
is
to
say
without
closing
his
fingers
or
making
the
slightest
movement
with
them
with
the
result
that
his
comrades
often
did
the
same
to
him
in
jest
and
called
it
the
deal
board
way
of
shaking
hands
he
and
i
nearly
always
sat
next
to
one
another
and
discussed
matters
generally
in
particular
he
pleased
me
with
the
freedom
with
which
he
would
criticise
the
professors
as
he
pointed
out
to
me
with
great
clearness
and
acumen
the
merits
or
demerits
of
their
respective
ways
of
teaching
and
made
occasional
fun
of
them
such
remarks
i
found
exceedingly
striking
and
diverting
when
uttered
in
his
quiet
mincing
voice
nevertheless
he
never
let
a
lecture
pass
without
taking
careful
notes
of
it
in
his
fine
handwriting
and
eventually
we
decided
to
join
forces
and
to
do
our
preparation
together
things
had
progressed
to
the
point
of
his
always
looking
pleased
when
i
took
my
usual
seat
beside
him
when
unfortunately
i
one
day
found
it
necessary
to
inform
him
that
before
her
death
my
mother
had
besought
my
father
never
to
allow
us
to
enter
for
a
government
scholarship
as
well
as
that
i
myself
considered
crown
students
no
matter
how
clever
to
well
they
are
not
gentlemen
i
concluded
though
beginning
to
flounder
a
little
and
grow
red
at
the
moment
operoff
said
nothing
but
at
subsequent
lectures
he
ceased
to
greet
me
or
to
offer
me
his
hand
and
never
attempted
to
talk
to
me
but
as
soon
as
ever
i
sat
down
he
would
lean
his
head
upon
his
arm
and
purport
to
be
absorbed
in
his
notebooks
i
was
surprised
at
this
sudden
coolness
but
looked
upon
it
as
infra
dig
pour
un
jeune
homme
de
bonne
maison
to
curry
favour
with
a
mere
crown
student
of
an
operoff
and
so
left
him
severely
alone
though
i
confess
that
his
aloofness
hurt
my
feelings
on
one
occasion
i
arrived
before
him
and
since
the
lecture
was
to
be
delivered
by
a
popular
professor
whom
students
came
to
hear
who
did
not
usually
attend
such
functions
i
found
almost
every
seat
occupied
accordingly
i
secured
operoff
s
place
for
myself
by
spreading
my
notebooks
on
the
desk
before
it
after
which
i
left
the
room
again
for
a
moment
when
i
returned
i
perceived
that
my
paraphernalia
had
been
relegated
to
the
bench
behind
and
the
place
taken
by
operoff
himself
i
remarked
to
him
that
i
had
already
secured
it
by
placing
my
notebooks
there
i
know
nothing
about
that
he
replied
sharply
yet
without
looking
up
at
me
i
tell
you
i
placed
my
notebooks
there
i
repeated
purposely
trying
to
bluster
in
the
hope
of
intimidating
him
every
one
saw
me
do
it
i
added
including
the
students
near
me
in
my
glance
several
of
them
looked
at
me
with
curiosity
yet
none
of
them
spoke
seats
can
not
be
booked
here
said
operoff
whoever
first
sits
down
in
a
place
keeps
it
and
settling
himself
angrily
where
he
was
he
flashed
at
me
a
glance
of
defiance
well
that
only
means
that
you
are
a
cad
i
said
i
have
an
idea
that
he
murmured
something
about
my
being
a
stupid
young
idiot
but
i
decided
not
to
hear
it
what
would
be
the
use
i
asked
myself
of
my
hearing
it
that
we
should
brawl
like
a
couple
of
manants
over
less
than
nothing
i
was
very
fond
of
the
word
manants
and
often
used
it
for
meeting
awkward
junctures
perhaps
i
should
have
said
something
more
had
not
at
that
moment
a
door
slammed
and
the
professor
dressed
in
a
blue
frockcoat
and
shuffling
his
feet
as
he
walked
ascended
the
rostrum
nevertheless
when
the
examination
was
about
to
come
on
and
i
had
need
of
some
one
s
notebooks
operoff
remembered
his
promise
to
lend
me
his
and
we
did
our
preparation
together
xxxvii
affairs
of
the
heart
affaires
du
coeur
exercised
me
greatly
that
winter
in
fact
i
fell
in
love
three
times
the
first
time
i
became
passionately
enamoured
of
a
buxom
lady
whom
i
used
to
see
riding
at
freitag
s
with
the
result
that
every
day
when
she
was
taking
a
lesson
there
that
is
to
say
every
tuesday
and
friday
i
used
to
go
to
gaze
at
her
but
always
in
such
a
state
of
trepidation
lest
i
should
be
seen
that
i
stood
a
long
way
off
and
bolted
directly
i
thought
her
likely
to
approach
the
spot
where
i
was
standing
likewise
i
used
to
turn
round
so
precipitately
whenever
she
appeared
to
be
glancing
in
my
direction
that
i
never
saw
her
face
well
and
to
this
day
do
not
know
whether
she
was
really
beautiful
or
not
dubkoff
who
was
acquainted
with
her
surprised
me
one
day
in
the
where
i
was
lurking
concealed
behind
the
lady
s
grooms
and
the
fur
wraps
which
they
were
holding
and
having
heard
from
dimitri
of
my
infatuation
frightened
me
so
terribly
by
proposing
to
introduce
me
to
the
amazon
that
i
fled
incontinently
from
the
school
and
was
prevented
by
the
mere
thought
that
possibly
he
had
told
her
about
me
from
ever
entering
the
place
again
or
even
from
hiding
behind
her
grooms
lest
i
should
encounter
her
whenever
i
fell
in
love
with
ladies
whom
i
did
not
know
and
especially
married
women
i
experienced
a
shyness
a
thousand
times
greater
than
i
had
ever
felt
with
sonetchka
i
dreaded
beyond
measure
that
my
divinity
should
learn
of
my
passion
or
even
of
my
existence
since
i
felt
sure
that
once
she
had
done
so
she
would
be
so
terribly
offended
that
i
should
never
be
forgiven
for
my
presumption
and
indeed
if
the
amazon
referred
to
above
had
ever
come
to
know
how
i
used
to
stand
behind
the
grooms
and
dream
of
seizing
her
and
carrying
her
off
to
some
country
spot
if
she
had
ever
come
to
know
how
i
should
have
lived
with
her
there
and
how
i
should
have
treated
her
it
is
probable
that
she
would
have
had
very
good
cause
for
indignation
but
i
always
felt
that
once
i
got
to
know
her
she
would
straightway
divine
these
thoughts
and
consider
herself
insulted
by
my
acquaintance
as
my
second
affaire
du
coeur
i
for
the
third
time
fell
in
love
with
sonetchka
when
i
saw
her
at
her
sister
s
my
second
passion
for
her
had
long
since
come
to
an
end
but
i
became
enamoured
of
her
this
third
time
through
lubotshka
sending
me
a
in
which
sonetchka
had
copied
some
extracts
from
lermontoff
s
the
demon
with
certain
of
the
more
subtly
amorous
passages
underlined
in
red
ink
and
marked
with
pressed
flowers
remembering
how
woloda
had
been
wont
to
kiss
his
inamorata
s
purse
last
year
i
essayed
to
do
the
same
thing
now
and
really
when
alone
in
my
room
in
the
evenings
and
engaged
in
dreaming
as
i
looked
at
a
flower
or
occasionally
pressed
it
to
my
lips
i
would
feel
a
certain
pleasantly
lachrymose
mood
steal
over
me
and
remain
genuinely
in
love
or
suppose
myself
to
be
so
for
at
least
several
days
finally
my
third
affaire
du
coeur
that
winter
was
connected
with
the
lady
with
whom
woloda
was
in
love
and
who
used
occasionally
to
visit
at
our
house
yet
in
this
damsel
as
i
now
remember
there
was
not
a
single
beautiful
feature
to
be
found
or
at
all
events
none
of
those
which
usually
pleased
me
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
moscow
lady
of
light
and
leading
and
petite
and
slender
wore
long
flaxen
curls
after
the
english
fashion
and
could
boast
of
a
transparent
profile
every
one
said
that
she
was
even
cleverer
and
more
learned
than
her
mother
but
i
was
never
in
a
position
to
judge
of
that
since
overcome
with
craven
bashfulness
at
the
mere
thought
of
her
intellect
and
accomplishments
i
never
spoke
to
her
alone
but
once
and
then
with
unaccountable
trepidation
woloda
s
enthusiasm
however
for
the
presence
of
an
audience
never
prevented
him
from
giving
vent
to
his
rapture
communicated
itself
to
me
so
strongly
that
i
also
became
enamoured
of
the
lady
yet
conscious
that
he
would
not
be
pleased
to
know
that
two
brothers
were
in
love
with
the
same
girl
i
never
told
him
of
my
condition
on
the
contrary
i
took
special
delight
in
the
thought
that
our
mutual
love
for
her
was
so
pure
that
though
its
object
was
in
both
cases
the
same
charming
being
we
remained
friends
and
ready
if
ever
the
occasion
should
arise
to
sacrifice
ourselves
for
one
another
yet
i
have
an
idea
that
as
regards
he
did
not
quite
share
my
views
for
he
was
so
passionately
in
love
with
the
lady
that
once
he
was
for
giving
a
member
of
the
diplomatic
corps
who
was
said
to
be
going
to
marry
her
a
slap
in
the
face
and
a
challenge
to
a
duel
but
for
my
part
i
would
gladly
have
sacrificed
my
feelings
for
his
sake
seeing
that
the
fact
that
the
only
remark
i
had
ever
addressed
to
her
had
been
on
the
subject
of
the
dignity
of
classical
music
and
that
my
passion
for
all
my
efforts
to
keep
it
alive
expired
the
following
week
would
have
rendered
it
the
more
easy
for
me
to
do
so
xxxviii
the
world
as
regards
those
worldly
delights
to
which
i
had
intended
on
entering
the
university
to
surrender
myself
in
imitation
of
my
brother
i
underwent
a
complete
disillusionment
that
winter
woloda
danced
a
great
deal
and
papa
also
went
to
balls
with
his
young
wife
but
i
appeared
to
be
thought
either
too
young
or
unfitted
for
such
delights
and
no
one
invited
me
to
the
houses
where
balls
were
being
given
yet
in
spite
of
my
vow
of
frankness
with
dimitri
i
never
told
him
nor
any
one
else
how
much
i
should
have
liked
to
go
to
those
dances
and
how
i
felt
hurt
at
being
forgotten
and
apparently
taken
for
the
philosopher
that
i
pretended
to
be
nevertheless
a
reception
was
to
be
given
that
winter
at
the
princess
kornakoff
s
and
to
it
she
sent
us
personal
invitations
to
myself
among
the
rest
consequently
i
was
to
attend
my
first
ball
before
starting
woloda
came
into
my
room
to
see
how
i
was
dressing
myself
an
act
on
his
part
which
greatly
surprised
me
and
took
me
aback
in
my
opinion
it
must
be
understood
solicitude
about
one
s
dress
was
a
shameful
thing
and
should
be
kept
under
but
he
seemed
to
think
it
a
thing
so
natural
and
necessary
that
he
said
outright
that
he
was
afraid
i
should
be
put
out
of
countenance
on
that
score
accordingly
he
bid
me
don
my
patent
leather
boots
and
was
horrified
to
find
that
i
wanted
to
put
on
gloves
of
peau
de
chamois
next
he
adjusted
my
in
a
particular
manner
and
carried
me
off
to
a
hairdresser
s
near
the
kuznetski
bridge
to
have
my
locks
coiffured
that
done
he
withdrew
to
a
little
distance
and
surveyed
me
yes
he
looks
right
enough
now
said
he
to
the
hairdresser
only
couldn
t
you
smooth
those
tufts
of
his
in
front
a
little
yet
for
all
that
monsieur
charles
treated
my
forelocks
with
one
essence
and
another
they
persisted
in
rising
up
again
when
ever
i
put
on
my
hat
in
fact
my
curled
and
tonsured
figure
seemed
to
me
to
look
far
worse
than
it
had
done
before
my
only
hope
of
salvation
lay
in
an
affectation
of
untidiness
only
in
that
guise
would
my
exterior
resemble
anything
at
all
woloda
apparently
was
of
the
same
opinion
for
he
begged
me
to
undo
the
curls
and
when
i
had
done
so
and
still
looked
unpresentable
he
ceased
to
regard
me
at
all
but
throughout
the
drive
to
the
kornakoffs
remained
silent
and
depressed
nevertheless
i
entered
the
kornakoffs
mansion
boldly
enough
and
it
was
only
when
the
princess
had
invited
me
to
dance
and
i
for
some
reason
or
another
though
i
had
driven
there
with
no
other
thought
in
my
head
than
to
dance
well
had
replied
that
i
never
indulged
in
that
pastime
that
i
began
to
blush
and
left
solitary
among
a
crowd
of
strangers
became
plunged
in
my
usual
insuperable
and
shyness
in
fact
i
remained
silent
on
that
spot
almost
the
whole
evening
nevertheless
while
a
waltz
was
in
progress
one
of
the
young
princesses
came
to
me
and
asked
me
with
the
sort
of
official
kindness
common
to
all
her
family
why
i
was
not
dancing
i
can
remember
blushing
hotly
at
the
question
but
at
the
same
time
feeling
for
all
my
efforts
to
prevent
it
a
smile
steal
over
my
face
as
i
began
talking
in
the
most
inflated
and
french
such
rubbish
as
even
now
after
dozens
of
years
it
shames
me
to
recall
it
must
have
been
the
effect
of
the
music
which
while
exciting
my
nervous
sensibility
drowned
as
i
supposed
the
less
intelligible
portion
of
my
utterances
anyhow
i
went
on
speaking
of
the
exalted
company
present
and
of
the
futility
of
men
and
women
until
i
had
got
myself
into
such
a
tangle
that
i
was
forced
to
stop
short
in
the
middle
of
a
word
of
a
sentence
which
i
found
myself
powerless
to
conclude
even
the
young
princess
was
shocked
by
my
conduct
and
gazed
at
me
in
reproach
whereat
i
burst
out
laughing
at
this
critical
moment
woloda
who
had
remarked
that
i
was
conversing
with
great
animation
and
probably
was
curious
to
know
what
excuses
i
was
making
for
not
dancing
approached
us
with
dubkoff
seeing
however
my
smiling
face
and
the
princess
s
frightened
mien
as
well
as
overhearing
the
appalling
rubbish
with
which
i
concluded
my
speech
he
turned
red
in
the
face
and
wheeled
round
again
the
princess
also
rose
and
left
me
i
continued
to
smile
but
in
such
a
state
of
agony
from
the
consciousness
of
my
stupidity
that
i
felt
ready
to
sink
into
the
floor
likewise
i
felt
that
come
what
might
i
must
move
about
and
say
something
in
order
to
effect
a
change
in
my
position
accordingly
i
approached
dubkoff
and
asked
him
if
he
had
danced
many
waltzes
with
her
that
night
this
i
feigned
to
say
in
a
gay
and
jesting
manner
yet
in
reality
i
was
imploring
help
of
the
very
dubkoff
to
whom
i
had
cried
hold
your
tongue
on
the
night
of
the
matriculation
dinner
by
way
of
answer
he
made
as
though
he
had
not
heard
me
and
turned
away
next
i
approached
woloda
and
said
with
an
effort
and
in
a
similar
tone
of
assumed
gaiety
hullo
woloda
are
you
played
out
yet
he
merely
looked
at
me
as
much
as
to
say
you
wouldn
t
speak
to
me
like
that
if
we
were
alone
and
left
me
without
a
word
in
the
evident
fear
that
i
might
continue
to
attach
myself
to
his
person
my
god
even
my
own
brother
deserts
me
i
thought
to
myself
yet
somehow
i
had
not
the
courage
to
depart
but
remained
standing
where
i
was
until
the
very
end
of
the
evening
at
length
when
every
one
was
leaving
the
room
and
crowding
into
the
hall
and
a
footman
slipped
my
greatcoat
on
to
my
shoulders
in
such
a
way
as
to
tilt
up
my
cap
i
gave
a
dreary
smile
and
remarked
to
no
one
in
particular
comme
c
est
gracieux
xxxix
the
students
feast
notwithstanding
that
as
yet
dimitri
s
influence
had
kept
me
from
indulging
in
those
customary
students
festivities
known
as
kutezhi
or
wines
that
winter
saw
me
participate
in
such
a
function
and
carry
away
with
me
a
not
impression
of
it
this
is
how
it
came
about
at
a
lecture
soon
after
the
new
year
baron
a
tall
young
fellow
of
very
serious
demeanour
and
regular
features
invited
us
all
to
spend
a
sociable
evening
with
him
by
us
all
i
mean
all
the
men
more
or
less
comme
il
faut
of
our
course
and
exclusive
of
grap
semenoff
operoff
and
commoners
of
that
sort
woloda
smiled
contemptuously
when
he
heard
that
i
was
going
to
a
wine
of
first
course
men
but
i
looked
to
derive
great
and
unusual
pleasure
from
this
to
me
novel
method
of
passing
the
time
accordingly
punctually
at
the
appointed
hour
of
eight
i
presented
myself
at
the
baron
s
our
host
in
an
open
tunic
and
white
waistcoat
received
his
guests
in
the
brilliantly
lighted
salon
and
of
the
small
mansion
where
his
parents
lived
they
having
given
up
their
reception
rooms
to
him
for
the
evening
for
purposes
of
this
party
in
the
corridor
could
be
seen
the
heads
and
skirts
of
inquisitive
domestics
while
in
the
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
dress
which
i
imagined
to
belong
to
the
baroness
herself
the
guests
numbered
a
score
and
were
all
of
them
students
except
herr
frost
in
attendance
upon
iwin
and
a
tall
gentleman
who
was
superintending
the
feast
and
who
was
introduced
to
every
one
as
a
relative
of
the
baron
s
and
a
former
student
of
the
university
of
dorpat
at
first
the
excessive
brilliancy
and
formal
appointments
of
the
had
such
a
chilling
effect
upon
this
youthful
company
that
every
one
involuntarily
hugged
the
walls
except
a
few
bolder
spirits
and
the
student
who
with
his
waistcoat
already
unbuttoned
seemed
to
be
in
every
room
and
in
every
corner
of
every
room
at
once
and
filled
the
whole
place
with
his
resonant
agreeable
tenor
voice
the
remainder
of
the
guests
preferred
either
to
remain
silent
or
to
talk
in
discreet
tones
of
professors
faculties
examinations
and
other
serious
and
interesting
matters
yet
every
one
without
exception
kept
watching
the
door
of
the
and
while
trying
to
conceal
the
fact
wearing
an
expression
which
said
come
it
is
time
to
i
too
felt
that
it
was
time
to
begin
and
awaited
the
beginning
with
pleasurable
impatience
after
footmen
had
handed
round
tea
among
the
guests
the
dorpat
student
asked
frost
in
russian
can
you
make
punch
frost
oh
ja
replied
frost
with
a
joyful
flourish
of
his
heels
and
the
other
went
on
then
do
you
set
about
it
they
addressed
each
other
in
the
second
person
singular
as
former
comrades
at
dorpat
frost
accordingly
departed
to
the
with
great
strides
of
his
bowed
muscular
legs
and
after
some
walking
backwards
and
forwards
deposited
upon
the
table
a
large
punchbowl
accompanied
by
a
sugar
loaf
supported
on
three
students
swords
placed
crosswise
meanwhile
the
baron
had
been
going
round
among
his
guests
as
they
sat
regarding
the
and
addressing
them
with
a
face
of
immutable
gravity
in
the
formula
i
beg
of
you
all
to
drink
of
this
in
student
fashion
that
there
may
be
among
the
members
of
our
course
unbutton
your
waistcoats
or
take
them
off
altogether
as
you
already
the
dorpat
student
had
divested
himself
of
his
tunic
and
rolled
up
his
white
above
his
elbows
and
now
planting
his
feet
firmly
apart
he
proceeded
to
set
fire
to
the
rum
in
the
gentlemen
put
out
the
candles
he
cried
with
a
sudden
shout
so
loud
and
insistent
that
we
seemed
all
of
us
to
be
shouting
at
once
however
we
still
went
on
silently
regarding
the
and
the
white
shirt
of
the
dorpat
student
with
a
feeling
that
a
moment
of
great
solemnity
was
approaching
put
out
the
lights
frost
i
tell
you
the
dorpat
student
shouted
again
evidently
the
punch
was
now
sufficiently
burnt
accordingly
every
one
helped
to
extinguish
the
candles
until
the
room
was
in
total
darkness
save
for
a
spot
where
the
white
shirts
and
hands
of
the
three
students
supporting
the
sugarloaf
on
their
crossed
swords
were
lit
up
by
the
lurid
flames
from
the
bowl
yet
the
dorpat
student
s
tenor
voice
was
not
the
only
one
to
be
heard
for
in
different
quarters
of
the
room
resounded
chattering
and
laughter
many
had
taken
off
their
tunics
especially
students
whose
garments
were
of
fine
cloth
and
perfectly
new
and
i
now
did
the
same
with
a
consciousness
that
it
was
there
had
been
no
great
festivity
as
yet
but
i
felt
assured
that
things
would
go
splendidly
when
once
we
had
begun
drinking
tumblers
of
the
potion
that
was
now
in
course
of
preparation
at
length
the
punch
was
ready
and
the
dorpat
student
with
much
bespattering
of
the
table
as
he
did
so
ladled
the
liquor
into
tumblers
and
cried
now
gentlemen
please
when
we
had
each
of
us
taken
a
sticky
tumbler
of
the
stuff
into
our
hands
the
dorpat
student
and
frost
sang
a
german
song
in
which
the
word
hoch
kept
occurring
again
and
again
while
we
joined
in
haphazard
fashion
in
the
chorus
next
we
clinked
glasses
together
shouted
something
in
praise
of
punch
crossed
hands
and
took
our
first
drink
of
the
sweet
strong
mixture
after
that
there
was
no
further
waiting
the
wine
was
in
full
swing
the
first
glassful
consumed
a
second
was
poured
out
yet
for
all
that
i
began
to
feel
a
throbbing
in
my
temples
and
that
the
flames
seemed
to
be
turning
purple
and
that
every
one
around
me
was
laughing
and
shouting
things
seemed
lacking
in
real
gaiety
and
i
somehow
felt
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
were
all
of
us
finding
the
affair
rather
dull
and
only
pretending
to
be
enjoying
it
the
dorpat
student
may
have
been
an
exception
for
he
continued
to
grow
more
and
more
red
in
the
face
and
more
and
more
ubiquitous
as
he
filled
up
empty
glasses
and
stained
the
table
with
fresh
spots
of
the
sweet
sticky
stuff
the
precise
sequence
of
events
i
can
not
remember
but
i
can
recall
feeling
strongly
attracted
towards
frost
and
the
dorpat
student
that
evening
learning
their
german
song
by
heart
and
kissing
them
each
on
their
lips
also
that
that
same
evening
i
conceived
a
violent
hatred
against
the
dorpat
student
and
was
for
pushing
him
from
his
chair
but
thought
better
of
it
also
that
besides
feeling
the
same
spirit
of
independence
towards
the
rest
of
the
company
as
i
had
felt
on
the
night
of
the
matriculation
dinner
my
head
ached
and
swam
so
badly
that
i
thought
each
moment
would
be
my
last
also
that
for
some
reason
or
another
we
all
of
us
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
imitated
the
movements
of
rowers
in
a
boat
as
we
sang
in
chorus
down
our
mother
stream
the
volga
also
that
i
conceived
this
procedure
on
our
part
to
be
uncalled
for
also
that
as
i
lay
prone
upon
the
floor
i
crossed
my
legs
and
began
wriggling
about
like
a
tsigane
gipsy
dancer
also
that
i
ricked
some
one
s
neck
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
should
never
have
done
such
a
thing
if
i
had
not
been
drunk
also
that
we
had
some
supper
and
another
kind
of
liquor
and
that
i
then
went
to
the
door
to
get
some
fresh
air
also
that
my
head
seemed
suddenly
to
grow
chill
and
that
i
noticed
as
i
drove
away
that
the
scat
of
the
vehicle
was
so
sharply
aslant
and
slippery
that
for
me
to
retain
my
position
behind
kuzma
was
impossible
also
that
he
seemed
to
have
turned
all
flabby
and
to
be
waving
about
like
a
dish
clout
but
what
i
remember
best
is
that
throughout
the
whole
of
that
evening
i
never
ceased
to
feel
that
i
was
acting
with
excessive
stupidity
in
pretending
to
be
enjoying
myself
to
like
drinking
a
great
deal
and
to
be
in
no
way
drunk
as
well
as
that
every
one
else
present
was
acting
with
equal
stupidity
in
pretending
those
same
things
all
the
time
i
had
a
feeling
that
each
one
of
my
companions
was
finding
the
festivities
as
distasteful
as
i
was
myself
but
in
the
belief
that
he
was
the
only
one
doing
so
felt
himself
bound
to
pretend
that
he
was
very
merry
in
order
not
to
mar
the
general
hilarity
also
strange
to
state
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
keep
up
this
pretence
for
the
sole
reason
that
into
a
there
had
been
poured
three
bottles
of
champagne
at
nine
roubles
the
bottle
and
ten
bottles
of
rum
at
four
making
seventy
roubles
in
all
exclusive
of
the
supper
so
convinced
of
my
folly
did
i
feel
that
when
at
next
day
s
lecture
those
of
my
comrades
who
had
been
at
baron
s
party
seemed
not
only
in
no
way
ashamed
to
remember
what
they
had
done
but
even
talked
about
it
so
that
other
students
might
hear
of
their
doings
i
felt
greatly
astonished
they
all
declared
that
it
had
been
a
splendid
wine
that
dorpat
students
were
just
the
fellows
for
that
kind
of
thing
and
that
there
had
been
consumed
at
it
no
less
than
forty
bottles
of
rum
among
twenty
guests
some
of
whom
had
dropped
senseless
under
the
table
that
they
should
care
to
talk
about
such
things
seemed
strange
enough
but
that
they
should
care
to
lie
about
them
seemed
absolutely
unintelligible
xl
my
friendship
with
the
nechludoffs
that
winter
too
i
saw
a
great
deal
both
of
dimitri
who
often
looked
us
up
and
of
his
family
with
whom
i
was
beginning
to
stand
on
intimate
terms
the
nechludoffs
that
is
to
say
mother
aunt
and
daughter
always
spent
their
evenings
at
home
at
which
time
the
princess
liked
young
men
to
visit
her
at
all
events
young
men
of
the
kind
whom
she
described
as
able
to
spend
an
evening
without
playing
cards
or
dancing
yet
such
young
fellows
must
have
been
few
and
far
between
for
although
i
went
to
the
nechludoffs
almost
every
evening
i
seldom
found
other
guests
present
thus
i
came
to
know
the
members
of
this
family
and
their
several
dispositions
well
enough
to
be
able
to
form
clear
ideas
as
to
their
mutual
relations
and
to
be
quite
at
home
amid
the
rooms
and
furniture
of
their
house
indeed
so
long
as
no
other
guests
were
present
i
felt
entirely
at
my
ease
true
at
first
i
used
to
feel
a
little
uncomfortable
when
left
alone
in
the
room
with
varenika
for
i
could
not
rid
myself
of
the
idea
that
though
far
from
pretty
she
wished
me
to
fall
in
love
with
her
but
in
time
this
nervousness
of
mine
began
to
lessen
since
she
always
looked
so
natural
and
talked
to
me
so
exactly
as
though
she
were
conversing
with
her
brother
or
lubov
sergievna
that
i
came
to
look
upon
her
simply
as
a
person
to
whom
it
was
in
no
way
dangerous
or
wrong
to
show
that
i
took
pleasure
in
her
company
throughout
the
whole
of
our
acquaintance
she
appeared
to
me
merely
a
plain
though
not
positively
ugly
girl
concerning
whom
one
would
never
ask
oneself
the
question
am
i
or
am
i
not
in
love
with
her
sometimes
i
would
talk
to
her
direct
but
more
often
i
did
so
through
dimitri
or
lubov
sergievna
and
it
was
the
latter
method
which
afforded
me
the
most
pleasure
i
derived
considerable
gratification
from
discoursing
when
she
was
there
from
hearing
her
sing
and
in
general
from
knowing
that
she
was
in
the
same
room
as
myself
but
it
was
seldom
now
that
any
thoughts
of
what
our
future
relations
might
ever
be
or
that
any
dreams
of
for
my
friend
if
he
should
ever
fall
in
love
with
my
sister
came
into
my
head
if
any
such
ideas
or
fancies
occurred
to
me
i
felt
satisfied
with
the
present
and
drove
away
all
thoughts
about
the
future
yet
in
spite
of
this
intimacy
i
continued
to
look
upon
it
as
my
bounden
duty
to
keep
the
nechludoffs
in
general
and
varenika
in
particular
in
ignorance
of
my
true
feelings
and
tastes
and
strove
always
to
appear
altogether
another
young
man
than
what
i
really
was
to
appear
indeed
such
a
young
man
as
could
never
possibly
have
existed
i
affected
to
be
soulful
and
would
go
off
into
raptures
and
exclamations
and
impassioned
gestures
whenever
i
wished
it
to
be
thought
that
anything
pleased
me
while
on
the
other
hand
i
tried
always
to
seem
indifferent
towards
any
unusual
circumstance
which
i
myself
perceived
or
which
i
had
had
pointed
out
to
me
i
aimed
always
at
figuring
both
as
a
sarcastic
cynic
divorced
from
every
sacred
tie
and
as
a
shrewd
observer
as
well
as
at
being
accounted
logical
in
all
my
conduct
precise
and
methodical
in
all
my
ways
of
life
and
at
the
same
time
contemptuous
of
all
materiality
i
may
safely
say
that
i
was
far
better
in
reality
than
the
strange
being
into
whom
i
attempted
to
convert
myself
yet
whatever
i
was
or
was
not
the
nechludoffs
were
unfailingly
kind
to
me
and
happily
for
myself
took
no
notice
as
it
now
appears
of
my
only
lubov
sergievna
who
i
believe
really
believed
me
to
be
a
great
egoist
atheist
and
cynic
had
no
love
for
me
but
frequently
disputed
what
i
said
flew
into
tempers
and
left
me
petrified
with
her
disjointed
irrelevant
utterances
yet
dimitri
held
always
to
the
same
strange
something
more
than
friendly
relations
with
her
and
used
to
say
not
only
that
she
was
misunderstood
by
every
one
but
that
she
did
him
a
world
of
good
this
however
did
not
prevent
the
rest
of
his
family
from
finding
fault
with
his
infatuation
once
when
talking
to
me
about
this
incomprehensible
attachment
varenika
explained
the
matter
thus
you
see
dimitri
is
a
selfish
person
he
is
very
proud
and
for
all
his
intellect
very
fond
of
praise
and
of
surprising
people
and
of
always
being
first
while
little
auntie
the
general
nickname
for
lubov
sergievna
is
innocent
enough
to
admire
him
and
at
the
same
time
devoid
of
the
tact
to
conceal
her
admiration
consequently
she
flatters
his
vanity
not
out
of
pretence
but
this
dictum
i
laid
to
heart
and
when
thinking
it
over
afterwards
could
not
but
come
to
the
conclusion
that
varenika
was
very
sensible
wherefore
i
was
glad
to
award
her
promotion
thenceforth
in
my
regard
yet
though
i
was
always
glad
enough
to
assign
her
any
credit
which
might
arise
from
my
discovering
in
her
character
any
signs
of
good
sense
or
other
moral
qualities
i
did
so
with
strict
moderation
and
never
ran
to
any
extreme
pitch
of
enthusiasm
in
the
process
thus
when
sophia
ivanovna
who
was
never
weary
of
discussing
her
niece
related
to
me
how
four
years
ago
varenika
had
suddenly
given
away
all
her
clothes
to
some
peasant
children
without
first
asking
permission
to
do
so
so
that
the
garments
had
subsequently
to
be
recovered
i
did
not
at
once
accept
the
fact
as
entitling
varenika
to
elevation
in
my
opinion
but
went
on
giving
her
good
advice
about
the
unpracticalness
of
such
views
on
property
when
other
guests
were
present
at
the
nechludoffs
among
them
sometimes
woloda
and
dubkoff
i
used
to
withdraw
myself
to
a
remote
plane
and
with
the
complacency
and
quiet
consciousness
of
strength
of
an
habitue
of
the
house
listen
to
what
others
were
saying
without
putting
in
a
remark
myself
yet
everything
that
these
others
said
seemed
to
me
so
immeasurably
stupid
that
i
used
to
feel
inwardly
amazed
that
such
a
clever
logical
woman
as
the
princess
with
her
equally
logical
family
could
listen
to
and
answer
such
rubbish
had
it
however
entered
into
my
head
to
compare
what
others
said
with
what
i
myself
said
when
there
alone
i
should
probably
have
ceased
to
feel
surprise
still
less
should
i
have
continued
to
feel
surprise
had
i
not
believed
that
the
women
of
our
own
household
avdotia
lubotshka
and
katenka
were
superior
to
the
rest
of
their
sex
for
in
that
case
i
should
have
remembered
the
kind
of
things
over
which
avdotia
and
katenka
would
laugh
and
jest
with
dubkoff
from
one
end
of
an
evening
to
the
other
i
should
have
remembered
that
seldom
did
an
evening
pass
but
dubkoff
would
first
have
an
argument
about
something
and
then
read
in
a
sententious
voice
either
some
verses
beginning
au
banquet
de
la
vie
infortune
convive
or
extracts
from
the
demon
in
short
i
should
have
remembered
what
nonsense
they
used
to
chatter
for
hours
at
a
time
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
when
guests
were
present
varenika
paid
less
attention
to
me
than
when
we
were
alone
as
well
as
that
i
was
deprived
of
the
reading
and
music
which
i
so
greatly
loved
to
hear
when
talking
to
guests
she
lost
in
my
eyes
her
principal
charm
that
of
quiet
seriousness
and
simplicity
i
remember
how
strange
it
used
to
seem
to
me
to
hear
her
discoursing
on
theatres
and
the
weather
to
my
brother
woloda
i
knew
that
of
all
things
in
the
world
he
most
despised
and
shunned
banality
and
that
varenika
herself
used
to
make
fun
of
forced
conversations
on
the
weather
and
similar
matters
why
then
when
meeting
in
society
did
they
both
of
them
talk
such
intolerable
nothings
and
as
it
were
shame
one
another
after
talks
of
this
kind
i
used
to
feel
silently
resentful
against
woloda
as
well
as
next
day
to
rally
varenika
on
her
overnight
guests
yet
one
result
of
it
was
that
i
derived
all
the
greater
pleasure
from
being
one
of
the
nechludoffs
family
circle
also
for
some
reason
or
another
i
began
to
prefer
meeting
dimitri
in
his
mother
s
to
being
with
him
alone
xli
my
friendship
with
the
nechludoffs
at
this
period
indeed
my
friendship
with
dimitri
hung
by
a
hair
i
had
been
criticising
him
too
long
not
to
have
discovered
faults
in
his
character
for
it
is
only
in
first
youth
that
we
love
passionately
and
therefore
love
only
perfect
people
as
soon
as
the
mists
engendered
by
love
of
this
kind
begin
to
dissolve
and
to
be
penetrated
by
the
clear
beams
of
reason
we
see
the
object
of
our
adoration
in
his
true
shape
and
with
all
his
virtues
and
failings
exposed
some
of
those
failings
strike
us
with
the
exaggerated
force
of
the
unexpected
and
combine
with
the
instinct
for
novelty
and
the
hope
that
perfection
may
yet
be
found
in
a
to
induce
us
not
only
to
feel
coldness
but
even
aversion
towards
the
late
object
of
our
adoration
consequently
desiring
it
no
longer
we
usually
cast
it
from
us
and
pass
onwards
to
seek
fresh
perfection
for
the
circumstance
that
that
was
not
what
occurred
with
respect
to
my
own
relation
to
dimitri
i
was
indebted
to
his
stubborn
punctilious
and
more
critical
than
impulsive
attachment
to
myself
a
tie
which
i
felt
ashamed
to
break
moreover
our
strange
vow
of
frankness
bound
us
together
we
were
afraid
that
if
we
parted
we
should
leave
in
one
another
s
power
all
the
incriminatory
moral
secrets
of
which
we
had
made
mutual
confession
at
the
same
time
our
rule
of
frankness
had
long
ceased
to
be
faithfully
observed
but
on
the
contrary
proved
a
frequent
cause
of
constraint
and
brought
about
strange
relations
between
us
almost
every
time
that
winter
that
i
went
upstairs
to
dimitri
s
room
i
used
to
find
there
a
university
friend
of
his
named
bezobiedoff
with
whom
he
appeared
to
be
very
much
taken
up
bezobiedoff
was
a
small
slight
fellow
with
a
face
pitted
over
with
smallpox
freckled
effeminate
hands
and
a
huge
flaxen
moustache
much
in
need
of
the
comb
he
was
invariably
dirty
shabby
uncouth
and
uninteresting
to
me
dimitri
s
relations
with
him
were
as
unintelligible
as
his
relations
with
lubov
sergievna
and
the
only
reason
he
could
have
had
for
choosing
such
a
man
for
his
associate
was
that
in
the
whole
university
there
was
no
student
than
bezobiedoff
yet
that
alone
would
have
been
sufficient
to
make
dimitri
extend
him
his
friendship
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
all
his
intercourse
with
this
fellow
he
seemed
to
be
saying
proudly
i
care
nothing
who
a
man
may
be
in
my
eyes
every
one
is
equal
i
like
him
and
therefore
he
is
a
desirable
nevertheless
i
could
not
imagine
how
he
could
bring
himself
to
do
it
nor
how
the
wretched
bezobiedoff
ever
contrived
to
maintain
his
awkward
position
to
me
the
friendship
seemed
a
most
distasteful
one
one
night
i
went
up
to
dimitri
s
room
to
try
and
get
him
to
come
down
for
an
evening
s
talk
in
his
mother
s
where
we
could
also
listen
to
varenika
s
reading
and
singing
but
bezobiedoff
had
forestalled
me
there
and
dimitri
answered
me
curtly
that
he
could
not
come
down
since
as
i
could
see
for
myself
he
had
a
visitor
with
him
besides
he
added
what
is
the
fun
of
sitting
there
we
had
much
better
stay
here
and
i
scarcely
relished
the
prospect
of
spending
a
couple
of
hours
in
bezobiedoff
s
company
yet
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
go
down
alone
wherefore
cursing
my
friend
s
vagaries
i
seated
myself
in
a
and
began
rocking
myself
silently
to
and
fro
i
felt
vexed
with
them
both
for
depriving
me
of
the
pleasures
of
the
and
my
only
hope
as
i
listened
irritably
to
their
conversation
was
that
bezobiedoff
would
soon
take
his
departure
a
nice
guest
indeed
to
be
sitting
with
i
thought
to
myself
when
a
footman
brought
in
tea
and
dimitri
had
five
times
to
beg
bezobiedoff
to
have
a
cup
for
the
reason
that
the
bashful
guest
thought
it
incumbent
upon
him
always
to
refuse
it
at
first
and
to
say
no
help
i
could
see
that
dimitri
had
to
put
some
restraint
upon
himself
as
he
resumed
the
conversation
he
tried
to
inveigle
me
also
into
it
but
i
remained
glum
and
silent
i
do
not
mean
to
let
my
face
give
any
one
the
suspicion
that
i
am
bored
was
my
mental
remark
to
dimitri
as
i
sat
quietly
rocking
myself
to
and
fro
with
measured
beat
yet
as
the
moments
passed
i
found
myself
not
without
a
certain
satisfaction
growing
more
and
more
inwardly
hostile
to
my
friend
what
a
fool
he
is
i
reflected
he
might
be
spending
the
evening
agreeably
with
his
charming
family
yet
he
goes
on
sitting
with
this
brute
will
go
on
doing
so
too
until
it
is
too
late
to
go
down
to
the
here
i
glanced
at
him
over
the
back
of
my
chair
and
thought
the
general
look
of
his
attitude
and
appearance
so
offensive
and
repellant
that
at
the
moment
i
could
gladly
have
offered
him
some
insult
even
a
most
serious
one
at
last
bezobiedoff
rose
but
dimitri
could
not
easily
let
such
a
delightful
friend
depart
and
asked
him
to
stay
the
night
fortunately
bezobiedoff
declined
the
invitation
and
departed
having
seen
him
off
dimitri
returned
and
smiling
a
faintly
complacent
smile
as
he
did
so
and
rubbing
his
hands
together
in
all
probability
partly
because
he
had
sustained
his
character
for
eccentricity
and
partly
because
he
had
got
rid
of
a
bore
started
to
pace
the
room
with
an
occasional
glance
at
myself
i
felt
more
offended
with
him
than
ever
how
can
he
go
on
walking
about
the
room
and
grinning
like
that
was
my
inward
reflection
what
are
you
so
angry
about
he
asked
me
suddenly
as
he
halted
in
front
of
my
chair
i
am
not
in
the
least
angry
i
replied
as
people
always
do
answer
under
such
circumstances
i
am
merely
vexed
that
you
should
to
me
and
to
bezobiedoff
and
to
what
rubbish
he
retorted
i
never
to
any
i
have
in
mind
our
rule
of
frankness
i
replied
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
certain
you
can
not
bear
this
bezobiedoff
any
more
than
i
can
he
is
an
absolute
cad
yet
for
some
inexplicable
reason
or
another
it
pleases
you
to
masquerade
before
not
at
all
to
begin
with
he
is
a
splendid
fellow
and
but
i
tell
you
it
is
so
i
also
tell
you
that
your
friendship
for
lubov
sergievna
is
founded
on
the
same
basis
namely
that
she
thinks
you
a
and
i
tell
you
once
more
that
it
is
not
oh
i
know
it
for
myself
i
retorted
with
the
heat
of
suppressed
anger
and
designing
to
disarm
him
with
my
frankness
i
have
told
you
before
and
i
repeat
it
now
that
you
always
seem
to
like
people
who
say
pleasant
things
to
you
but
that
as
soon
as
ever
i
come
to
examine
your
friendship
i
invariably
find
that
there
exists
no
real
attachment
between
oh
but
you
are
wrong
said
dimitri
with
an
angry
straightening
of
the
neck
in
his
collar
when
i
like
people
neither
their
praise
nor
their
blame
can
make
any
difference
to
my
opinion
of
well
dreadful
though
it
may
seem
to
you
i
confess
that
i
myself
often
used
to
hate
my
father
when
he
abused
me
and
to
wish
that
he
was
dead
in
the
same
way
you
speak
for
yourself
i
am
very
sorry
that
you
could
ever
have
been
so
no
no
i
cried
as
i
leapt
from
my
chair
and
faced
him
with
the
courage
of
exasperation
it
is
for
yourself
that
you
ought
to
feel
sorry
sorry
because
you
never
told
me
a
word
about
this
fellow
you
know
that
was
not
honourable
of
you
nevertheless
i
will
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
and
burning
to
wound
him
even
more
than
he
had
wounded
me
i
set
out
to
prove
to
him
that
he
was
incapable
of
feeling
any
real
affection
for
anybody
and
that
i
had
the
best
of
grounds
as
in
very
truth
i
believed
i
had
for
reproaching
him
i
took
great
pleasure
in
telling
him
all
this
but
at
the
same
time
forgot
that
the
only
conceivable
purpose
of
my
doing
so
to
force
him
to
confess
to
the
faults
of
which
i
had
accused
him
could
not
possibly
be
attained
at
the
present
moment
when
he
was
in
a
rage
had
he
on
the
other
hand
been
in
a
condition
to
argue
calmly
i
should
probably
never
have
said
what
i
did
the
dispute
was
verging
upon
an
open
quarrel
when
dimitri
suddenly
became
silent
and
left
the
room
i
pursued
him
and
continued
what
i
was
saying
but
he
did
not
answer
i
knew
that
his
failings
included
a
hasty
temper
and
that
he
was
now
fighting
it
down
wherefore
i
cursed
his
good
resolutions
the
more
in
my
heart
this
then
was
what
our
rule
of
frankness
had
brought
us
to
the
rule
that
we
should
tell
one
another
everything
in
our
minds
and
never
discuss
one
another
with
a
third
person
many
a
time
we
had
exaggerated
frankness
to
the
pitch
of
making
mutual
confession
of
the
most
shameless
thoughts
and
of
shaming
ourselves
by
voicing
to
one
another
proposals
or
schemes
for
attaining
our
desires
yet
those
confessions
had
not
only
failed
to
draw
closer
the
tie
which
united
us
but
had
dissipated
sympathy
and
thrust
us
further
apart
until
now
pride
would
not
allow
him
to
expose
his
feelings
even
in
the
smallest
detail
and
we
employed
in
our
quarrel
the
very
weapons
which
we
had
formerly
surrendered
to
one
another
the
weapons
which
could
strike
the
shrewdest
blows
xlii
our
stepmother
notwithstanding
that
papa
had
not
meant
to
return
to
moscow
before
the
new
year
he
arrived
in
october
when
there
was
still
good
riding
to
hounds
to
be
had
in
the
country
he
alleged
as
his
reason
for
changing
his
mind
that
his
suit
was
shortly
to
come
on
before
the
senate
but
mimi
averred
that
avdotia
had
found
herself
so
ennuyee
in
the
country
and
had
so
often
talked
about
moscow
and
pretended
to
be
unwell
that
papa
had
decided
to
accede
to
her
wishes
you
see
she
never
really
loved
him
she
and
her
love
only
kept
buzzing
about
his
ears
because
she
wanted
to
marry
a
rich
man
added
mimi
with
a
pensive
sigh
which
said
to
think
what
a
certain
other
person
could
have
done
for
him
if
only
he
had
valued
her
yet
that
certain
other
person
was
unjust
to
avdotia
seeing
that
the
latter
s
affection
for
papa
the
passionate
devoted
love
of
revealed
itself
in
her
every
look
and
word
and
movement
at
the
same
time
that
love
in
no
way
hindered
her
not
only
from
being
averse
to
parting
with
her
adored
husband
but
also
from
desiring
to
visit
madame
annette
s
and
order
there
a
lovely
cap
a
hat
trimmed
with
a
magnificent
blue
ostrich
feather
and
a
blue
venetian
velvet
bodice
which
was
to
expose
to
the
public
gaze
the
snowy
well
shaped
breast
and
arms
which
no
one
had
yet
gazed
upon
except
her
husband
and
maids
of
course
katenka
sided
with
her
mother
and
in
general
there
became
established
between
avdotia
and
ourselves
from
the
day
of
her
arrival
the
most
extraordinary
and
burlesque
order
of
relations
as
soon
as
she
stepped
from
the
carriage
woloda
assumed
an
air
of
great
seriousness
and
ceremony
and
advancing
towards
her
with
much
bowing
and
scraping
said
in
the
tone
of
one
who
is
presenting
something
for
acceptance
i
have
the
honour
to
greet
the
arrival
of
our
dear
mamma
and
to
kiss
her
ah
my
dear
son
she
replied
with
her
beautiful
unvarying
smile
and
do
not
forget
the
younger
son
i
said
as
i
also
approached
her
hand
with
an
involuntary
imitation
of
woloda
s
voice
and
expression
had
our
stepmother
and
ourselves
been
certain
of
any
mutual
affection
that
expression
might
have
signified
contempt
for
any
outward
manifestation
of
our
love
had
we
been
towards
one
another
it
might
have
denoted
irony
or
contempt
for
pretence
or
a
desire
to
conceal
from
papa
standing
by
the
while
our
real
relations
as
well
as
many
other
thoughts
and
sentiments
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
expression
which
well
consorted
with
avdotia
s
own
spirit
simply
signified
nothing
at
all
simply
concealed
the
absence
of
any
definite
relations
between
us
in
later
life
i
often
had
occasion
to
remark
in
the
case
of
other
families
whose
members
anticipated
among
themselves
relations
not
altogether
harmonious
the
sort
of
provisional
burlesque
relations
which
they
formed
for
daily
use
and
it
was
just
such
relations
as
those
which
now
became
established
between
ourselves
and
our
stepmother
we
scarcely
ever
strayed
beyond
them
but
were
polite
to
her
conversed
with
her
in
french
bowed
and
scraped
before
her
and
called
her
chere
maman
a
term
to
which
she
always
responded
in
a
tone
of
similar
lightness
and
with
her
beautiful
unchanging
smile
only
the
lachrymose
lubotshka
with
her
goose
feet
and
artless
prattle
really
liked
our
stepmother
or
tried
in
her
naive
and
frequently
awkward
way
to
bring
her
and
ourselves
together
wherefore
the
only
person
in
the
world
for
whom
besides
papa
avdotia
had
a
spark
of
affection
was
lubotshka
indeed
avdotia
always
treated
her
with
a
kind
of
grave
admiration
and
timid
deference
which
greatly
surprised
me
from
the
first
avdotia
was
very
fond
of
calling
herself
our
stepmother
and
hinting
that
since
children
and
servants
usually
adopt
an
unjust
and
hostile
attitude
towards
a
woman
thus
situated
her
own
position
was
likely
to
prove
a
difficult
one
yet
though
she
foresaw
all
the
unpleasantness
of
her
predicament
she
did
nothing
to
escape
from
it
by
for
instance
conciliating
this
one
giving
presents
to
that
other
one
and
forbearing
to
grumble
the
last
a
precaution
which
it
would
have
been
easy
for
her
to
take
seeing
that
by
nature
she
was
in
no
way
exacting
as
well
as
very
yet
not
only
did
she
do
none
of
these
things
but
her
expectation
of
difficulties
led
her
to
adopt
the
defensive
before
she
had
been
attacked
that
is
to
say
supposing
that
the
entire
household
was
designing
to
show
her
every
kind
of
insult
and
annoyance
she
would
see
plots
where
no
plots
were
and
consider
that
her
most
dignified
course
was
to
suffer
in
silence
an
attitude
of
passivity
as
regards
winning
affection
which
of
course
led
to
disaffection
moreover
she
was
so
totally
lacking
in
that
faculty
of
apprehension
to
which
i
have
already
referred
as
being
highly
developed
in
our
household
and
all
her
customs
were
so
utterly
opposed
to
those
which
had
long
been
rooted
in
our
establishment
that
those
two
facts
alone
were
bound
to
go
against
her
from
the
first
her
mode
of
life
in
our
tidy
methodical
household
was
that
of
a
person
only
just
arrived
there
sometimes
she
went
to
bed
late
sometimes
early
sometimes
she
appeared
at
luncheon
sometimes
she
did
not
sometimes
she
took
supper
sometimes
she
dispensed
with
it
when
we
had
no
guests
with
us
she
more
often
than
not
walked
about
the
house
in
a
condition
and
was
not
ashamed
to
appear
before
us
even
before
the
servants
in
a
white
chemise
with
only
a
shawl
thrown
over
her
bare
shoulders
at
first
this
bohemianism
pleased
me
but
before
very
long
it
led
to
my
losing
the
last
shred
of
respect
which
i
felt
for
her
what
struck
me
as
even
more
strange
was
the
fact
that
according
as
we
had
or
had
not
guests
she
was
two
different
women
the
one
the
woman
figuring
in
society
was
a
young
and
healthy
but
rather
cold
beauty
a
person
richly
dressed
neither
stupid
nor
clever
and
unfailingly
cheerful
the
other
woman
the
one
in
evidence
when
no
guests
were
present
was
considerably
past
her
first
youth
languid
depressed
slovenly
and
ennuyee
though
affectionate
frequently
as
i
looked
at
her
when
smiling
rosy
with
the
winter
air
and
happy
in
the
consciousness
of
her
beauty
she
came
in
from
a
round
of
calls
and
taking
off
her
hat
went
to
look
at
herself
in
a
mirror
or
when
rustling
in
her
rich
decollete
ball
dress
and
at
once
shy
and
proud
before
the
servants
she
was
passing
to
her
carriage
or
when
at
one
of
our
small
receptions
at
home
she
was
sitting
dressed
in
a
high
silken
dress
finished
with
some
sort
of
fine
lace
about
her
soft
neck
and
flashing
her
unvarying
but
lovely
smile
around
her
as
i
looked
at
her
at
such
times
i
could
not
help
wondering
what
would
have
been
said
by
persons
who
had
been
ravished
to
behold
her
thus
if
they
could
have
seen
her
as
i
often
saw
her
namely
when
waiting
in
the
lonely
midnight
hours
for
her
husband
to
return
from
his
club
she
would
walk
like
a
shadow
from
room
to
room
with
her
hair
dishevelled
and
her
form
clad
in
a
sort
of
presently
she
would
sit
down
to
the
piano
and
her
brows
all
puckered
with
the
effort
play
over
the
only
waltz
that
she
knew
after
which
she
would
pick
up
a
novel
read
a
few
pages
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
it
and
throw
it
aside
next
repairing
in
person
to
the
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
servants
she
would
get
herself
a
cucumber
and
some
cold
veal
and
eat
it
standing
by
the
then
once
more
resume
her
weary
aimless
gloomy
wandering
from
room
to
room
but
what
above
all
other
things
caused
estrangement
between
us
was
that
lack
of
understanding
which
expressed
itself
chiefly
in
the
peculiar
air
of
indulgent
attention
with
which
she
would
listen
when
any
one
was
speaking
to
her
concerning
matters
of
which
she
had
no
knowledge
it
was
not
her
fault
that
she
acquired
the
unconscious
habit
of
bending
her
head
down
and
smiling
slightly
with
her
lips
only
when
she
found
it
necessary
to
converse
on
topics
which
did
not
interest
her
which
meant
any
topic
except
herself
and
her
husband
yet
that
smile
and
that
inclination
of
the
head
when
incessantly
repeated
could
become
unbearably
wearisome
also
her
peculiar
gaiety
which
always
sounded
as
though
she
were
laughing
at
herself
at
you
and
at
the
world
in
general
was
gauche
and
anything
but
infectious
while
her
sympathy
was
too
evidently
forced
lastly
she
knew
no
reticence
with
regard
to
her
ceaseless
rapturising
to
all
and
sundry
concerning
her
love
for
papa
although
she
only
spoke
the
truth
when
she
said
that
her
whole
life
was
bound
up
with
him
and
although
she
proved
it
her
life
long
we
considered
such
unrestrained
continual
insistence
upon
her
affection
for
him
bad
form
and
felt
more
ashamed
for
her
when
she
was
descanting
thus
before
strangers
even
than
we
did
when
she
was
perpetrating
bad
blunders
in
french
yet
although
as
i
have
said
she
loved
her
husband
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
and
he
too
had
a
great
affection
for
her
or
at
all
events
he
had
at
first
and
when
he
saw
that
others
besides
himself
admired
her
beauty
it
seemed
almost
as
though
she
purposely
did
everything
most
likely
to
displease
him
simply
to
prove
to
him
the
strength
of
her
love
her
readiness
to
sacrifice
herself
for
his
sake
and
the
fact
that
her
one
aim
in
life
was
to
win
his
affection
she
was
fond
of
display
and
my
father
too
liked
to
see
her
as
a
beauty
who
excited
wonder
and
admiration
yet
she
sacrificed
her
weakness
for
fine
clothes
to
her
love
for
him
and
grew
more
and
more
accustomed
to
remain
at
home
in
a
plain
grey
blouse
again
papa
considered
freedom
and
equality
to
be
indispensable
conditions
of
family
life
and
hoped
that
his
favourite
lubotshka
and
his
young
wife
would
become
sincere
friends
yet
once
again
avdotia
sacrificed
herself
by
considering
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
pay
the
real
mistress
of
the
house
as
she
called
lubotshka
an
amount
of
deference
which
only
shocked
and
annoyed
my
father
likewise
he
played
cards
a
great
deal
that
winter
and
lost
considerable
sums
towards
the
end
of
it
wherefore
unwilling
as
usual
to
let
his
gambling
affairs
intrude
upon
his
family
life
he
began
to
preserve
complete
secrecy
concerning
his
play
yet
avdotia
though
often
ailing
as
well
as
towards
the
end
of
the
winter
enceinte
considered
herself
bound
always
to
sit
up
in
a
grey
blouse
and
with
her
hair
dishevelled
for
my
father
when
at
say
four
or
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
he
returned
home
from
the
club
ashamed
depleted
in
pocket
and
weary
she
would
ask
him
whether
he
had
been
fortunate
in
play
and
listen
with
indulgent
attention
little
nods
of
her
head
and
a
faint
smile
upon
her
face
as
he
told
her
of
his
doings
at
the
club
and
begged
her
for
about
the
hundredth
time
never
to
sit
up
for
him
again
yet
though
papa
s
winnings
or
losings
upon
which
his
substance
practically
depended
in
no
way
interested
her
she
was
always
the
first
to
meet
him
when
he
returned
home
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
this
she
was
incited
to
do
not
only
by
the
strength
of
her
devotion
but
by
a
certain
secret
jealousy
from
which
she
suffered
no
one
in
the
world
could
persuade
her
that
it
was
really
from
his
club
and
not
from
a
mistress
s
that
papa
came
home
so
late
she
would
try
to
read
love
secrets
in
his
face
and
discerning
none
there
would
sigh
with
a
sort
of
enjoyment
of
her
grief
and
give
herself
up
once
more
to
the
contemplation
of
her
unhappiness
as
the
result
of
these
and
many
other
constant
sacrifices
which
occurred
in
papa
s
relations
with
his
wife
during
the
latter
months
of
that
winter
a
time
when
he
lost
much
and
was
therefore
out
of
spirits
there
gradually
grew
up
between
the
two
an
intermittent
feeling
of
tacit
hostility
of
restrained
aversion
to
the
object
of
devotion
of
the
kind
which
expresses
itself
in
an
unconscious
eagerness
to
show
the
object
in
question
every
possible
species
of
petty
annoyance
xliii
new
comrades
the
winter
had
passed
imperceptibly
and
the
thaw
begun
when
the
list
of
examinations
was
posted
at
the
university
and
i
suddenly
remembered
that
i
had
to
return
answers
to
questions
in
eighteen
subjects
on
which
i
had
heard
lectures
delivered
but
with
regard
to
some
of
which
i
had
taken
no
notes
and
made
no
preparation
whatever
it
seems
strange
that
the
question
how
am
i
going
to
pass
should
never
have
entered
my
head
but
the
truth
is
that
all
that
winter
i
had
been
in
such
a
state
of
haze
through
the
delights
of
being
both
and
comme
il
faut
that
whenever
the
question
of
the
examinations
had
occurred
to
me
i
had
mentally
compared
myself
with
my
comrades
and
thought
to
myself
they
are
certain
to
pass
and
as
most
of
them
are
not
comme
il
faut
and
i
am
therefore
their
personal
superior
i
too
am
bound
to
come
out
all
in
fact
the
only
reason
why
i
attended
lectures
at
all
was
that
i
might
become
an
habitue
of
the
university
and
obtain
papa
s
leave
to
go
in
and
out
of
the
house
moreover
i
had
many
acquaintances
now
and
often
enjoyed
myself
vastly
at
the
university
i
loved
the
racket
talking
and
laughter
in
the
auditorium
the
opportunities
for
sitting
on
a
back
bench
and
letting
the
measured
voice
of
the
professor
lure
one
into
dreams
as
one
contemplated
one
s
comrades
the
occasional
runnings
across
the
way
for
a
snack
and
a
glass
of
vodka
sweetened
by
the
fearful
joy
of
knowing
that
one
might
be
hauled
before
the
professor
for
so
doing
the
stealthy
closing
of
the
door
as
one
returned
to
the
auditorium
and
the
participation
in
course
versus
course
scuffles
in
the
corridors
all
this
was
very
enjoyable
by
the
time
however
that
every
one
had
begun
to
put
in
a
better
attendance
at
lectures
and
the
professor
of
physics
had
completed
his
course
and
taken
his
leave
of
us
until
the
examinations
came
on
and
the
students
were
busy
collecting
their
notebooks
and
arranging
to
do
their
preparation
in
parties
it
struck
me
that
i
also
had
better
prepare
for
the
ordeal
operoff
with
whom
i
still
continued
on
bowing
but
otherwise
most
frigid
terms
suddenly
offered
not
only
to
lend
me
his
notebooks
but
to
let
me
do
my
preparation
with
himself
and
some
other
students
i
thanked
him
and
accepted
the
invitation
hoping
by
that
conferment
of
honour
completely
to
dissipate
our
old
misunderstanding
but
at
the
same
time
i
requested
that
the
gatherings
should
always
be
held
at
my
home
since
my
quarters
were
so
splendid
to
this
the
students
replied
that
they
meant
to
take
turn
and
turn
about
sometimes
to
meet
at
one
fellow
s
place
sometimes
at
another
s
as
might
be
most
convenient
the
first
of
our
reunions
was
held
at
zuchin
s
who
had
a
small
in
a
large
building
on
the
trubni
boulevard
the
opening
night
i
arrived
late
and
entered
when
the
reading
aloud
had
already
begun
the
little
apartment
was
thick
with
while
on
the
table
stood
a
bottle
of
vodka
a
decanter
some
bread
some
salt
and
a
of
mutton
without
rising
zuchin
asked
me
to
have
some
vodka
and
to
doff
my
tunic
i
expect
you
are
not
accustomed
to
such
entertainment
he
added
every
one
was
wearing
a
dirty
cotton
shirt
and
a
dickey
endeavouring
not
to
show
my
contempt
for
the
company
i
took
off
my
tunic
and
lay
down
in
a
sociable
manner
on
the
sofa
zuchin
went
on
reading
aloud
and
correcting
himself
with
the
help
of
notebooks
while
the
others
occasionally
stopped
him
to
ask
a
question
which
he
always
answered
with
ability
correctness
and
precision
i
listened
for
a
time
with
the
rest
but
not
understanding
much
of
it
since
i
had
not
been
present
at
what
had
been
read
before
soon
interpolated
a
question
hullo
old
fellow
it
will
be
no
good
for
you
to
listen
if
you
do
not
know
the
subject
said
zuchin
i
will
lend
you
my
notebooks
and
then
you
can
read
it
up
by
and
i
will
explain
it
to
i
felt
rather
ashamed
of
my
ignorance
also
i
felt
the
truth
of
what
he
said
so
i
gave
up
listening
and
amused
myself
by
observing
my
new
comrades
according
to
my
classification
of
humanity
into
persons
comme
il
faut
and
persons
not
comme
il
faut
they
evidently
belonged
to
the
latter
category
and
so
aroused
in
me
not
only
a
feeling
of
contempt
but
also
a
certain
sensation
of
personal
hostility
for
the
reason
that
though
not
comme
il
faut
they
accounted
me
their
equal
and
actually
patronised
me
in
a
sort
of
fashion
what
in
particular
excited
in
me
this
feeling
was
their
feet
their
dirty
nails
and
fingers
a
particularly
long
talon
on
operoff
s
obtrusive
little
finger
their
red
shirts
their
dickeys
the
chaff
which
they
threw
at
one
another
the
dirty
room
a
habit
which
zuchin
had
of
continually
snuffling
and
pressing
a
finger
to
his
nose
and
above
all
their
manner
of
speaking
that
is
to
say
their
use
and
intonation
of
words
for
instance
they
said
flat
for
fool
just
the
ticket
for
exactly
grandly
for
splendidly
and
so
on
all
of
which
seemed
to
me
either
bookish
or
disagreeably
vulgar
still
more
was
my
comme
il
faut
refinement
disturbed
by
the
accents
which
they
put
upon
certain
russian
and
still
more
upon
foreign
words
thus
they
said
dieyatelnost
for
dieyatelnost
narochno
for
narochno
v
kaminie
for
v
kaminie
shakespeare
for
shakespeare
and
so
forth
yet
for
all
their
insuperably
repellent
exterior
i
could
detect
something
good
in
these
fellows
and
envied
them
the
cheerful
which
united
them
in
one
consequently
i
began
to
feel
attracted
towards
them
and
made
up
my
mind
that
come
what
might
i
would
become
of
their
number
the
kind
and
honourable
operoff
i
knew
already
and
now
the
brusque
but
exceptionally
clever
zuchin
who
evidently
took
the
lead
in
this
circle
began
to
please
me
greatly
he
was
a
dark
little
fellow
with
a
perennially
glistening
polished
face
but
one
that
was
extremely
lively
intellectual
and
independent
in
its
expression
that
expression
it
derived
from
a
low
but
prominent
forehead
deep
black
eyes
short
bristly
hair
and
a
thick
dark
beard
which
looked
as
though
it
stood
in
constant
need
of
trimming
although
too
he
seemed
to
think
nothing
of
himself
a
trail
which
always
pleased
me
in
people
it
was
clear
that
he
never
let
his
brain
rest
he
had
one
of
those
expressive
faces
which
a
few
hours
after
you
have
seen
them
for
the
first
time
change
suddenly
and
entirely
to
your
view
such
a
change
took
place
in
my
eyes
with
regard
to
zuchin
s
face
towards
the
end
of
that
evening
suddenly
i
seemed
to
see
new
wrinkles
appear
upon
its
surface
its
eyes
grow
deeper
its
smile
become
a
different
one
and
the
whole
face
assume
such
an
altered
aspect
that
i
scarcely
recognised
it
when
the
reading
was
ended
zuchin
the
other
students
and
myself
manifested
our
desire
to
be
comrades
all
by
drinking
vodka
until
little
remained
in
the
bottle
thereupon
zuchin
asked
if
any
one
had
a
to
spare
so
that
he
could
send
the
old
woman
who
looked
after
him
to
buy
some
more
yet
on
my
offering
to
provide
the
money
he
made
as
though
he
had
not
heard
me
and
turned
to
operoff
who
pulled
out
a
purse
sewn
with
bugles
and
handed
him
the
sum
required
and
mind
you
don
t
get
drunk
added
the
giver
who
himself
had
not
partaken
of
the
vodka
by
heavens
answered
zuchin
as
he
sucked
the
marrow
out
of
a
mutton
bone
i
remember
thinking
that
it
must
be
because
he
ate
marrow
that
he
was
so
clever
by
heavens
he
went
on
with
a
slight
smile
and
his
smile
was
of
the
kind
that
one
involuntarily
noticed
and
somehow
felt
grateful
for
even
if
i
did
get
drunk
there
would
be
no
great
harm
done
i
wonder
which
of
us
two
could
look
after
himself
the
better
you
or
i
anyway
i
am
willing
to
make
the
experiment
and
he
slapped
his
forehead
with
mock
boastfulness
but
what
a
pity
it
is
that
semenoff
has
disappeared
he
has
gone
and
completely
hidden
himself
sure
enough
the
semenoff
who
had
comforted
me
so
much
at
my
first
examination
by
being
worse
dressed
than
myself
and
who
after
passing
the
second
examination
had
attended
his
lectures
regularly
during
the
first
month
had
disappeared
thereafter
from
view
and
never
been
seen
at
the
university
throughout
the
latter
part
of
the
course
where
is
he
asked
some
one
i
do
not
know
replied
zuchin
he
has
escaped
my
eye
altogether
yet
what
fun
i
used
to
have
with
him
what
fire
there
was
in
the
man
and
what
an
intellect
i
should
be
indeed
sorry
if
he
has
come
to
grief
and
come
to
grief
he
probably
has
for
he
was
no
mere
boy
to
take
his
university
course
in
after
a
little
further
conversation
and
agreeing
to
meet
again
the
next
night
at
zuchin
s
since
his
abode
was
the
most
central
point
for
us
all
we
began
to
disperse
as
one
by
one
we
left
the
room
my
conscience
started
pricking
me
because
every
one
seemed
to
be
going
home
on
foot
whereas
i
had
my
drozhki
accordingly
with
some
hesitation
i
offered
operoff
a
lift
zuchin
came
to
the
door
with
us
and
after
borrowing
a
rouble
of
operoff
went
off
to
make
a
night
of
it
with
some
friends
as
we
drove
along
operoff
told
me
a
good
deal
about
zuchin
s
character
and
mode
of
life
and
on
reaching
home
it
was
long
before
i
could
get
to
sleep
for
thinking
of
the
new
acquaintances
i
had
made
for
many
an
hour
as
i
lay
awake
i
kept
wavering
between
the
respect
which
their
knowledge
simplicity
and
sense
of
honour
as
well
as
the
poetry
of
their
youth
and
courage
excited
in
my
regard
and
the
distaste
which
i
felt
for
their
outward
man
in
spite
of
my
desire
to
do
so
it
was
at
that
time
literally
impossible
for
me
to
associate
with
them
since
our
ideas
were
too
wholly
at
variance
for
me
life
s
meaning
and
charm
contained
an
infinitude
of
shades
of
which
they
had
not
an
inkling
and
vice
versa
the
greatest
obstacles
of
all
however
to
our
better
acquaintance
i
felt
to
be
the
twenty
roubles
worth
of
cloth
in
my
tunic
my
drozhki
and
my
white
linen
shirt
and
they
appeared
to
me
most
important
obstacles
since
they
made
me
feel
as
though
i
had
unwittingly
insulted
these
comrades
by
displaying
such
tokens
of
my
wealth
i
felt
guilty
in
their
eyes
and
as
though
whether
i
accepted
or
rejected
their
acquittal
and
took
a
line
of
my
own
i
could
never
enter
into
equal
and
unaffected
relations
with
them
yet
to
such
an
extent
did
the
stirring
poetry
of
the
courage
which
i
could
detect
in
zuchin
in
particular
overshadow
the
coarse
vicious
side
of
his
nature
that
the
latter
made
no
unpleasant
impression
upon
me
for
a
couple
of
weeks
i
visited
zuchin
s
almost
every
night
for
purposes
of
work
yet
i
did
very
little
there
since
as
i
have
said
i
had
lost
ground
at
the
start
and
not
having
sufficient
grit
in
me
to
catch
up
my
companions
by
solitary
study
was
forced
merely
to
pretend
that
i
was
listening
to
and
taking
in
all
they
were
reading
i
have
an
idea
too
that
they
divined
my
pretence
since
i
often
noticed
that
they
passed
over
points
which
they
themselves
knew
without
first
inquiring
of
me
whether
i
did
the
same
yet
day
by
day
i
was
coming
to
regard
the
vulgarity
of
this
circle
with
more
indulgence
to
feel
increasingly
drawn
towards
its
way
of
life
and
to
find
in
it
much
that
was
poetical
only
my
word
of
honour
to
dimitri
that
i
would
never
indulge
in
dissipation
with
these
new
comrades
kept
me
from
deciding
also
to
share
their
diversions
once
i
thought
i
would
make
a
display
of
my
knowledge
of
literature
particularly
french
literature
and
so
led
the
conversation
to
that
theme
judge
then
of
my
surprise
when
i
discovered
that
not
only
had
my
companions
been
reading
the
foreign
passages
in
russian
but
that
they
had
studied
far
more
foreign
works
than
i
had
and
knew
and
could
appraise
english
and
even
spanish
writers
of
whom
i
had
never
so
much
as
heard
likewise
pushkin
and
zhukovski
represented
to
them
literature
and
not
as
to
myself
certain
books
in
yellow
covers
which
i
had
once
read
and
studied
when
a
child
for
dumas
and
sue
they
had
an
almost
equal
contempt
and
in
general
were
competent
to
form
much
better
and
clearer
judgments
on
literary
matters
than
i
was
for
all
that
i
refused
to
recognise
the
fact
in
knowledge
of
music
too
i
could
not
beat
them
and
was
astonished
to
find
that
operoff
played
the
violin
and
another
student
the
cello
and
piano
while
both
of
them
were
members
of
the
university
orchestra
and
possessed
a
wide
knowledge
of
and
appreciation
of
good
music
in
short
with
the
exception
of
the
french
and
german
languages
my
companions
were
better
posted
at
every
point
than
i
was
yet
not
the
least
proud
of
the
fact
true
i
might
have
plumed
myself
on
my
position
as
a
man
of
the
world
but
woloda
excelled
me
even
in
that
wherein
then
lay
the
height
from
which
i
presumed
to
look
down
upon
these
comrades
in
my
acquaintanceship
with
prince
ivan
ivanovitch
in
my
ability
to
speak
french
in
my
drozhki
in
my
linen
shirt
in
my
surely
these
things
are
all
rubbish
was
the
thought
which
would
come
flitting
through
my
head
under
the
influence
of
the
envy
which
the
and
kindly
youthful
gaiety
displayed
around
me
excited
in
my
breast
every
one
addressed
his
interlocutor
in
the
second
person
singular
true
the
familiarity
of
this
address
almost
approximated
to
rudeness
yet
even
the
boorish
exterior
of
the
speaker
could
not
conceal
a
constant
endeavour
never
to
hurt
another
one
s
feelings
the
terms
brute
or
swine
when
used
in
this
fashion
only
convulsed
me
and
gave
me
cause
for
inward
merriment
in
no
way
did
they
offend
the
person
addressed
or
prevent
the
company
at
large
from
remaining
on
the
most
sincere
and
friendly
footing
in
all
their
intercourse
these
youths
were
delicate
and
forbearing
in
a
way
that
only
very
poor
and
very
young
men
can
be
however
much
i
might
detect
in
zuchin
s
character
and
amusements
an
element
of
coarseness
and
profligacy
i
could
also
detect
the
fact
that
his
were
of
a
very
different
order
to
the
puerility
with
burnt
rum
and
champagne
in
which
i
had
participated
at
baron
s
xliv
zuchin
and
semenoff
although
i
do
not
know
what
class
of
society
zuchin
belonged
to
i
know
that
without
the
help
either
of
means
or
social
position
he
had
matriculated
from
the
seventh
gymnasium
at
that
time
he
was
eighteen
though
he
looked
much
older
and
very
clever
especially
in
his
powers
of
assimilation
to
him
it
was
easier
to
survey
the
whole
of
some
complicated
subject
to
foresee
its
various
parts
and
deductions
than
to
use
that
knowledge
when
gained
for
reasoning
out
the
exact
laws
to
which
those
deductions
were
due
he
knew
that
he
was
clever
and
of
the
fact
he
was
proud
yet
from
that
very
pride
arose
the
circumstance
that
he
treated
every
one
with
unvarying
simplicity
and
moreover
his
experience
of
life
must
have
been
considerable
for
already
he
had
squandered
much
love
friendship
activity
and
money
though
poor
and
moving
only
in
the
lower
ranks
of
society
there
was
nothing
which
he
had
ever
attempted
for
which
he
did
not
thenceforth
feel
the
contempt
the
indifference
or
the
utter
disregard
which
were
bound
to
result
from
his
attaining
his
goal
too
easily
in
fact
the
very
ardour
with
which
he
applied
himself
to
a
new
pursuit
seemed
to
be
due
to
his
contempt
for
what
he
had
already
attained
since
his
abilities
always
led
him
to
success
and
therefore
to
a
certain
right
to
despise
it
with
the
sciences
it
was
the
same
though
little
interested
in
them
and
taking
no
notes
he
knew
mathematics
thoroughly
and
was
uttering
no
vain
boast
when
he
said
that
he
could
beat
the
professor
himself
much
of
what
he
heard
said
in
lectures
he
thought
rubbish
yet
with
his
peculiar
habit
of
unconsciously
practical
roguishness
he
feigned
to
subscribe
to
all
that
the
professors
thought
important
and
every
professor
adored
him
true
he
was
outspoken
to
the
authorities
but
they
none
the
less
respected
him
besides
disliking
and
despising
the
sciences
he
despised
all
who
laboured
to
attain
what
he
himself
had
mastered
so
easily
since
the
sciences
as
he
understood
them
did
not
occupy
part
of
his
powers
in
fact
life
as
he
saw
it
from
the
student
s
standpoint
contained
nothing
to
which
he
could
devote
himself
wholly
and
his
impetuous
active
nature
as
he
himself
often
said
demanded
life
complete
wherefore
he
frequented
the
in
so
far
as
he
could
afford
it
and
surrendered
himself
to
dissipation
chiefly
out
of
a
desire
to
get
as
far
away
from
himself
as
possible
consequently
just
as
the
examinations
were
approaching
operoff
s
prophecy
to
me
came
true
for
zuchin
wasted
two
whole
weeks
in
this
fashion
and
we
had
to
do
the
latter
part
of
our
preparation
at
another
student
s
yet
at
the
first
examination
he
reappeared
with
pale
haggard
face
and
tremulous
hands
and
passed
brilliantly
into
the
second
course
the
company
of
roisterers
of
which
zuchin
had
been
the
leader
since
its
formation
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
consisted
of
eight
students
among
whom
at
first
had
been
numbered
ikonin
and
semenoff
but
the
former
had
left
under
the
strain
of
the
continuous
revelry
in
which
the
band
had
indulged
in
the
early
part
of
the
term
and
the
latter
seceded
later
for
reasons
which
were
never
wholly
explained
in
its
early
days
this
band
had
been
looked
upon
with
awe
by
all
the
fellows
of
our
course
and
had
had
its
exploits
much
discussed
of
these
exploits
the
leading
heroes
had
been
zuchin
and
towards
the
end
of
the
term
semenoff
but
the
latter
had
come
to
be
generally
shunned
and
to
cause
disturbances
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
attended
a
lecture
just
before
the
examinations
began
he
rounded
off
his
drinking
exploits
in
a
most
energetic
and
original
fashion
as
i
myself
had
occasion
to
witness
through
my
acquaintanceship
with
zuchin
this
is
how
it
was
one
evening
we
had
just
assembled
at
zuchin
s
and
operoff
reinforcing
a
candlestick
with
a
candle
stuck
in
a
bottle
had
just
plunged
his
nose
into
his
notebooks
and
begun
to
read
aloud
in
his
thin
voice
from
his
notes
on
physics
when
the
landlady
entered
the
room
and
informed
zuchin
that
some
one
had
brought
a
note
for
him
the
remainder
of
this
chapter
is
omitted
in
the
original
xlv
i
come
to
grief
at
length
the
first
examination
on
differentials
and
integrals
drew
near
but
i
continued
in
a
vague
state
which
precluded
me
from
forming
any
clear
idea
of
what
was
awaiting
me
every
evening
after
consorting
with
zuchin
and
the
rest
the
thought
would
occur
to
me
that
there
was
something
in
my
convictions
which
i
must
change
something
wrong
and
mistaken
yet
every
morning
the
daylight
would
find
me
again
satisfied
to
be
comme
il
faut
and
desirous
of
no
change
whatsoever
such
was
the
frame
of
mind
in
which
i
attended
for
the
first
examination
i
seated
myself
on
the
bench
where
the
princes
counts
and
barons
always
sat
and
began
talking
to
them
in
french
with
the
not
unnatural
result
that
i
never
gave
another
thought
to
the
answers
which
i
was
shortly
to
return
to
questions
in
a
subject
of
which
i
knew
nothing
i
gazed
supinely
at
other
students
as
they
went
up
to
be
examined
and
even
allowed
myself
to
chaff
some
of
them
well
grap
i
said
to
ilinka
who
from
our
first
entry
into
the
university
had
shaken
off
my
influence
had
ceased
to
smile
when
i
spoke
to
him
and
always
remained
towards
me
have
you
survived
the
ordeal
yes
retorted
ilinka
let
us
see
if
you
can
do
i
smiled
contemptuously
at
the
answer
notwithstanding
that
the
doubt
which
he
had
expressed
had
given
me
a
momentary
shock
once
again
however
indifference
overlaid
that
feeling
and
i
remained
so
entirely
and
supine
that
the
very
moment
after
i
had
been
examined
a
mere
formality
for
me
as
it
turned
out
i
was
making
a
dinner
appointment
with
baron
z
when
called
out
with
ikonin
i
smoothed
the
creases
in
my
uniform
and
walked
up
to
the
examiner
s
table
with
perfect
sang
froid
true
a
slight
shiver
of
apprehension
ran
down
my
back
when
the
young
professor
the
same
one
as
had
examined
me
for
my
matriculation
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
as
i
reached
across
to
the
envelope
containing
the
tickets
ikonin
though
taking
a
ticket
with
the
same
plunge
of
his
whole
body
as
he
had
done
at
the
previous
examinations
did
at
least
return
some
sort
of
an
answer
this
time
though
a
poor
one
i
on
the
contrary
did
just
as
he
had
done
on
the
two
previous
occasions
or
even
worse
since
i
took
a
second
ticket
yet
for
a
second
time
returned
no
answer
the
professor
looked
me
compassionately
in
the
face
and
said
in
a
quiet
but
determined
voice
you
will
not
pass
into
the
second
course
monsieur
irtenieff
you
had
better
not
complete
the
examinations
the
faculty
must
be
weeded
out
the
same
with
you
monsieur
ikonin
implored
leave
to
finish
the
examinations
as
a
great
favour
but
the
professor
replied
that
he
ikonin
was
not
likely
to
do
in
two
days
what
he
had
not
succeeded
in
doing
in
a
year
and
that
he
had
not
the
smallest
chance
of
passing
ikonin
renewed
his
humble
piteous
appeals
but
the
professor
was
inexorable
you
can
go
gentlemen
he
remarked
in
the
same
quiet
resolute
voice
i
was
only
too
glad
to
do
so
for
i
felt
ashamed
of
seeming
by
my
silent
presence
to
be
joining
in
ikonin
s
humiliating
prayers
for
grace
i
have
no
recollection
of
how
i
threaded
my
way
through
the
students
in
the
hall
nor
of
what
i
replied
to
their
questions
nor
of
how
i
passed
into
the
vestibule
and
departed
home
i
was
offended
humiliated
and
genuinely
unhappy
for
three
days
i
never
left
my
room
and
saw
no
one
but
found
relief
in
copious
tears
i
should
have
sought
a
pistol
to
shoot
myself
if
i
had
had
the
necessary
determination
for
the
deed
i
thought
that
ilinka
grap
would
spit
in
my
face
when
he
next
met
me
and
that
he
would
have
the
right
to
do
so
that
operoff
would
rejoice
at
my
misfortune
and
tell
every
one
of
it
that
kolpikoff
had
justly
shamed
me
that
night
at
the
restaurant
that
my
stupid
speeches
to
princess
kornikoff
had
had
their
fitting
result
and
so
on
and
so
on
all
the
moments
in
my
life
which
had
been
for
me
most
difficult
and
painful
recurred
to
my
mind
i
tried
to
blame
some
one
for
my
calamity
and
thought
that
some
one
must
have
done
it
on
purpose
must
have
conspired
a
whole
intrigue
against
me
next
i
murmured
against
the
professors
against
my
comrades
woloda
dimitri
and
papa
the
last
for
having
sent
me
to
the
university
at
all
finally
i
railed
at
providence
for
ever
having
let
me
see
such
ignominy
believing
myself
ruined
for
ever
in
the
eyes
of
all
who
knew
me
i
besought
papa
to
let
me
go
into
the
hussars
or
to
the
caucasus
naturally
papa
was
anything
but
pleased
at
what
had
happened
yet
on
seeing
my
passionate
grief
he
comforted
me
by
saying
that
though
it
was
a
bad
business
it
might
yet
be
mended
by
my
transferring
to
another
faculty
woloda
who
also
saw
nothing
very
terrible
in
my
misfortune
added
that
at
least
i
should
not
be
put
out
of
countenance
in
a
new
faculty
since
i
should
have
new
comrades
there
as
for
the
ladies
of
the
household
they
neither
knew
nor
cared
what
either
an
examination
or
a
plucking
meant
and
condoled
with
me
only
because
they
saw
me
in
such
distress
dimitri
came
to
see
me
every
day
and
was
very
kind
and
consolatory
throughout
but
for
that
very
reason
he
seemed
to
me
to
have
grown
colder
than
before
it
always
hurt
me
and
made
me
feel
uncomfortable
when
he
came
up
to
my
room
and
seated
himself
in
silence
beside
me
much
as
a
doctor
might
scat
himself
by
the
bedside
of
an
awkward
patient
sophia
ivanovna
and
varenika
sent
me
books
for
which
i
had
expressed
a
wish
as
also
an
invitation
to
go
and
see
them
but
in
that
very
thoughtfulness
of
theirs
i
saw
only
proud
humiliating
condescension
to
one
who
had
fallen
beyond
forgiveness
although
in
three
days
time
i
grew
calmer
it
was
not
until
we
departed
for
the
country
that
i
left
the
house
but
spent
the
time
in
nursing
my
grief
and
wandering
fearful
of
all
the
household
through
the
various
rooms
one
evening
as
i
was
sitting
deep
in
thought
and
listening
to
avdotia
playing
her
waltz
i
suddenly
leapt
to
my
feet
ran
upstairs
got
out
the
whereon
i
had
once
inscribed
rules
of
my
life
opened
it
and
experienced
my
first
moment
of
repentance
and
moral
resolution
true
i
burst
into
tears
once
more
but
they
were
no
longer
tears
of
despair
pulling
myself
together
i
set
about
writing
out
a
fresh
set
of
rules
in
the
assured
conviction
that
never
again
would
i
do
a
wrong
action
waste
a
single
moment
on
frivolity
or
alter
the
rules
which
i
now
decided
to
frame
how
long
that
moral
impulse
lasted
what
it
consisted
of
and
what
new
principles
i
devised
for
my
moral
growth
i
will
relate
when
speaking
of
the
ensuing
and
happier
portion
of
my
early
manhood
