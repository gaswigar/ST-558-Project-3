of

jr
translated
from
the
original
bornese
into
english
verse
by

author
of
the

sonnets
of
a
hoodlum
with
eight

burgess
introduction
since
the
publication
of
edward
fitzgerald
classic
translation
of
the
rubaiyat
in
or
rather
since
its
general
popularity
several
years
later
poets
minor
and
major
have
been
rendering
the
sincerest
form
of
flattery
to
the
genius
of
the
irishman
who
brought
persia
into
the
best
regulated
families
unfortunately
there
was
only
one
omar
and
there
were
scores
of
imitators
who
in
order
to
make
the
astronomer
go
round
were
obliged
to
draw
him
out
to
the
thinness
of
balzac
magic
skin
while
all
this
was
going
on
the
present
editor
was
forced
to
conclude
that
the
burning
literary
need
was
not
for
more
translators
but
for
more
omars
to
translate
and
what
was
his
surprise
to
note
that
the
work
of
a
later
and
superior
omar
khayyam
was
lying
undiscovered
in
the
wilds
of
borneo
here
indeed
was
a
sensation
in
the
world
of
letters
a
revelation
as
thrilling
as
the
disinterment
of
ossian
forgotten
songs
the
discovery
of
an
unsubmerged
atlantis
while
some
stout
cortez
more
worthy
than
the
editor
might
have
stood
on
this
new
darien
and
gazed
over
the
sleeping
demesne
of
omar
khayyam
he
had
so
to
speak
the
advantage
of
being
first
on
the
ground
and
to
him
fell
the
duty
nolens
volens
of
lifting
the
rare
philosophy
out
of
the
erebus
that
had
so
long
cloaked
it
in
obscurity
it
is
still
a
matter
of
surprise
to
the
editor
that
the
discovery
of
these
rubaiyat
should
have
been
left
to
this
late
date
when
in
sentiment
and
philosophy
they
have
points
of
superiority
over
the
quatrains
of
the
first
omar
of
naishapur
the
genius
of
the
east
has
indeed
ever
been
slow
to
reveal
itself
in
the
west
it
took
a
crusade
to
bring
to
our
knowledge
anything
of
the
schöner
geist
of
the
orient
and
it
was
not
until
the
day
of
matthew
arnold
that
the
epic
of
persia
was
brought
into
the
proper
realm
of
english
poesy
what
wonder
then
that
not
until
the
first
omaric
madness
had
passed
away
were
the
rubaiyat
of
omar
khayyam
lifted
into
the
light
after
an
infinity
of
sudor
et
labor
spent
in
excavating
under
the
irregular
verbs
declensions
and
exceptions
to
every
rule
which
go
to
make
the
ancient
dialect
in
which
the
poem
was
originally
written
foremost
among
the
dead
languages
although
little
is
known
of
the
life
of
omar
khayyam
the
elder
the
details
of
his
private
career
are
far
more
complete
than
those
of
his
son
omar
khayyam
jr
in
fact
many
historians
have
been
so
careless
as
to
have
entirely
omitted
mention
of
the
existence
of
such
a
person
as
the
younger
omar
comparative
records
of
the
two
languages
however
show
plainly
how
the
mantle
was
handed
from
the
father
to
the
son
and
how
it
became
the
commendable
duty
of
the
second
generation
to
correct
and
improve
upon
the
first
omar
khayyam
died
in
the
early
part
of
the
eleventh
century
having
sold
his
poems
profitably
with
the
proceeds
of
which
he
established
taverns
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
persia
omar
died
in
the
height
of
his
popularity
but
shortly
after
his
death
the
city
of
naishapur
became
a
temperance
town
even
yet
the
younger
omar
might
have
lived
and
sung
at
naishapur
had
not
a
fanatical
sect
of
sufi
women
taking
advantage
of
the
increasing
respectability
of
the
once
jovial
city
risen
in
a
body
against
the
house
of
omar
and
literally
razed
it
to
the
ground
with
the
aid
of
hatchets
which
were
at
that
time
the
peculiar
weapon
of
the
sex
and
sect
it
is
said
that
the
younger
omar
who
was
then
a
youth
was
obliged
to
flee
from
the
wrath
of
the
good
government
propagandists
and
to
take
abode
in
a
distant
city
for
some
time
he
wandered
about
persia
in
a
destitute
condition
plying
the
hereditary
trade
of
but
at
length
poverty
compelled
him
to
quit
his
native
country
for
good
and
to
try
his
fortunes
in
a
land
so
remote
that
the
dissolute
record
of
his
parent
could
no
longer
hound
him
borneo
was
the
island
to
which
the
poet
fled
and
here
the
historian
finds
him
some
years
later
prospering
in
the
world
goods
and
greatly
reverenced
by
the
inhabitants
although
omar
was
undoubtedly
the
greatest
man
that
borneo
has
yet
produced
he
must
not
be
confused
in
the
mind
of
the
reader
with
the
wild
man
of
borneo
who
although
himself
a
poet
was
a
man
of
far
less
culture
than
the
author
of
the
present
rubaiyat
while
not
a
good
templar
the
younger
omar
showed
a
commendable
tendency
toward
reform
the
sensitive
soul
of
the
poet
was
ever
cankered
with
the
thought
that
his
father
jovial
habits
had
put
him
in
a
false
position
and
that
it
was
his
filial
duty
to
retrieve
the
family
reputation
it
was
his
life
work
to
inculcate
into
the
minds
of
the
people
with
whom
he
had
taken
abode
the
thought
that
the
alcoholic
pleasures
of
his
father
were
false
joys
and
that
as
sung
in
number
vi
there
comfort
only
in
the
smoking
car
in
tobacco
the
son
found
a
lasting
and
comparatively
harmless
substitute
for
the
wine
which
none
can
doubt
caused
the
elder
omar
to
complain
so
bitterly
indeed
the
idols
i
have
loved
so
long
have
done
my
credit
in
men
eyes
much
wrong
note
the
cheerfulness
with
which
the
son
answers
the
father
in
a
stanza
which
may
be
taken
as
a
key
to
his
reformatory
philosophy
o
foozied
poetasters
fogged
with
wine
who
to
your
orgies
bid
the
muses
nine
go
bid
them
then
but
leave
to
me
the
tenth
whose
name
is
nicotine
for
she
is
mine
quite
in
accordance
with
his
policy
of
improving
on
his
father
rakish
muse
was
the
frequent
endorsement
of
the
beautiful
and
harmless
practice
of
kissing
the
kiss
is
mentioned
some
times
in
the
present
work
and
in
the
nine
hundred
untranslated
rubaiyat
two
hundred
and
ten
more
kisses
occur
making
a
grand
total
of
two
hundred
and
omaric
kisses
enough
of
kisses
can
there
be
enough
it
may
be
truly
said
that
the
father
left
the
discovery
of
woman
to
his
son
for
nowhere
in
the
rubaiyat
of
naishapur
poet
is
full
justice
done
to
the
charms
of
the
fair
even
in
his
most
ardent
passages
old
omar
uttered
no
more
than
a
eulogy
to
friendship
where
the
philosophy
of
the
elder
omar
was
bacchanalian
and
epicurean
that
of
the
son
was
tobacchanalian
and
eclectic
allowing
excess
only
in
moderation
as
it
were
and
countenancing
nothing
more
violent
than
poetic
license
however
we
are
led
to
believe
that
the
tastes
of
his
time
called
for
a
certain
mild
sensuality
as
the
gustatio
to
a
feast
of
reason
and
had
omar
khayyam
lived
in
our
own
day
he
would
doubtless
have
agreed
with
a
reverend
erlington
and
bosworth
professor
in
the
university
of
cambridge
who
boldly
asserts
that
the
literature
redolent
of
nothing
but
the
glories
of
asceticism
deserves
the
credit
due
to
goodness
of
intention
and
nothing
else
due
doubtless
to
the
preservative
influence
of
smoke
omar
khayyam
was
enabled
to
live
to
the
hale
age
of
one
hundred
and
seven
and
to
go
to
an
apotheosis
fully
worthy
his
greatness
among
the
native
chroniclers
the
quatrain
number
xcviii
then
let
the
balmed
tobacco
be
my
sheath
the
ardent
weed
above
me
and
beneath
and
let
me
like
a
living
incense
rise
a
cigar
between
my
teeth
has
been
the
source
of
much
relentless
debate
by
some
it
is
held
that
this
stanza
is
prophetic
in
its
nature
foreseeing
the
transcendent
miracle
of
the
poet
death
by
others
it
is
as
stoutly
maintained
that
the
poet
in
the
above
lines
decreed
that
his
work
should
be
preserved
and
handed
down
to
posterity
in
a
wrapping
of
tobacco
the
editor
is
inclined
to
the
belief
that
there
is
much
truth
in
both
opinions
for
the
parchment
when
it
came
to
hand
was
stained
and
scented
from
its
wrappings
of
virginia
and
perique
and
the
manner
of
the
poet
death
marks
number
xci
as
another
remarkable
instance
of
the
clairvoyance
of
the
muse
to
quote
from
the
quaint
words
of
the
native
chronicler
for
while
the
volcanic
singer
was
seated
one
day
in
the
shade
of
a
banyan
tree
fresh
cigars
and
abandoned
stumps
surrounding
him
like
the
little
hills
that
climb
the
mountain
he
nodded
and
fell
asleep
still
puffing
lustily
at
a
panatella
sweet
and
black
now
the
poet
beard
was
long
and
his
sleep
deep
and
as
the
weed
grew
shorter
with
each
ecstatic
puff
the
little
brand
of
fire
drew
closer
and
closer
to
the
beautiful
hairy
mantle
that
fell
from
the
poet
chin
that
day
the
island
was
wrapped
in
a
light
gauze
of
blue
mist
an
exotic
smoke
that
was
a
blessing
to
the
nostrils
it
suffused
the
whole
island
from
end
to
end
and
reminded
the
happy
inhabitants
of
the
cigars
of
nirvana
grown
in
some
plantation
of
the
blessed
when
the
smoke
had
passed
and
our
heads
were
cleared
of
the
narcotic
fumes
we
hastened
to
the
spot
where
our
good
master
had
loved
to
sit
but
there
naught
remained
but
a
great
heap
of
white
ashes
sitting
among
the
pipes
and
cigars
that
had
inspired
his
song
thus
he
died
as
he
lived

ardent

aloes
according
to
oscar
wilde
in
the
picture
of
dorian
grey
have
the
power
of
banishing
melancholy
wherever
their
perfume
penetrates
eolian

may
be
the
exotic
melodies
that

from

xxiii
forgiviness
the
reader
will
probably
regard
this
spelling
of
forgiveness
somewhat
unusual
and
the
editor
freely
confesses
that
he
has
no
authority
for
such
usage
but
since
fitzgerald
has
coined
enow
for
the
sake
of
a
rhyme
the
editor
hopes
that
he
will
be
forgiven
his
forgiviness
xxix
with
what
an
equanimity
there
is
an
untranslated
quatrain
to
the
effect
that
ugliness
is
the
only
sin
that
can
make
a
woman
ashamed
to
look
her
mirror
in
the
face
xxv
the
breaking
of
the
glass
at
the
gaze
of
gorgona
as
well
as
the
squamiest
serpent
in
her
locks
mentioned
in
ii
give
us
a
clew
as
to
the
derivation
of
her
name
from
that
of
the
gorgon
medusa
whose
uncomeliness
was
so
intense
as
to
petrify
all
that
met
her
gaze
on
the
other
hand
the
glance
of
gorgona
seemed
to
be
rather
explosive
than
congealing
xxv
torques
this
word
like
squamiest
is
derived
directly
from
the
latin
to
be
used
in
this
work
they
are
not
properly
english
words
but
the
editor
intends
they
shall
become
so
in
the
near
future

used
in

xxvii
attar
is
the
persian
word
for
druggist
but
we
hesitate
to
believe
that
the
poet
would
attribute
an
artificial
perfume
to
the
rose
xxxv
myself
when
young
this
stanza
is
supposed
to
be
biographical
in
its
intent
it
is
known
that
before
the
uprising
in
naishapur
and
even
during
his
errant
tour
through
persia
the
younger
omar
was
socially
lionized
becoming
much
sought
after
it
may
seem
improbable
that
omar
as
a
member
of
the
sterner
sex
should
have
been
admitted
as
a
regular
frequenter
of
women
clubs
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
then
even
as
in
our
own
day
men
were
eagerly
prized
as
lecturers
on
subjects
of
interest
to
women
omar
appeared
for
several
seasons
before
the
women
clubs
of
naishapur
giving
recitations
and
readings
from
his
father
works

for
a
persian
poet
of
so
remote
a
date
omar
khayyam
showed
a
remarkable
knowledge
of
modern
as
well
as
mediaeval
literature
lvii
that
great

another
reference
to
his
experience
as
a
social
lion
is
found
here
as
in
the
three

following
the
gabble
garbled
garrulousness
the
familiar
gobble
gabble
and
git
crystallized
into
the
higher
form
of
expression
indicates
that
the
narcotic
effect
of
tea
on
womankind
was
much
the
same
in
omar
time
as
in
ours
lxi
leave
to
me
the
tenth
the
discovery
of
a
tenth
muse
puts
the
younger
omar
on
an
equal
footing
with
his
father
in
science
as
well
as
in
poetry
the
editor
has
found
that
upon
quitting
forever
his
native
persia
omar
khayyam
brought
to
borneo
many
of
the
more
refined
sciences
in
his
hereditary
profession
astronomy
he
claims
the
rare
distinction
of
having
first
made
observations
through
the
medium
of
a
his
long
fidelity
to
this
method
was
rewarded
by
some
remarkable
results
for
his
private
journals
show
that
on
several
occasions
he
was
able
to
discern
as
many
as
eight
sister
satellites
swimming
in
eccentric
orbits
around
the
moon
a
discovery
which
our
modern
science
has
never
been
able
to
equal
or
even
to
approach

the

this
though
indescribably
beautiful
in
the
original
is
somewhat
too
involved
for
us
to
grasp
the
meaning
at
one
reading
perhaps
in
thus
weaving
the
alphabet
into
his
numbers
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
poet
to
give
promise
of
the
ultimate
attainment
of
the
alpha
and
omega
of
knowledge
perhaps
the
stanza
on
the
other
hand
was
merely
intended
as
a
pretty
poetical
conceit
an
exercise
in
metrical
ingenuity
if
the
latter
theory
holds
good
what
a
pity
it
would
seem
that
these
rubaiyat
were
not
originally
written
in
chinese
the
infinite
alphabet
of
which
language
would
have
furnished
material
for
the
present
work
and
several
revised
editions
also
lxxiii
while

roses
in
a
cabbage
lot
confusing
perhaps
at
first
reading
but
here
again
may
the
student
employ
the
device
of
symbolism
with
great
advantage
the
roses
may
be
taken
for
the
flowers
of
fancy
the
cabbage
lot
for
the
field
of
sordid
reality
as
a
staple
vegetable
the
rose
can
never
compete
with
the
cabbage

on
his

and

there
are
many
who
may
very
justly
consider
this
line
as
undignified
and
unrefined
but
such
readers
should
always
remember
that
these
quatrains
may
be
taken
as
purely
symbolical
thus
the
fingers
and
toes
may
be
regarded
as
mental
aspects
and
the
whistle
as
whatever
best
suits
the
reader
