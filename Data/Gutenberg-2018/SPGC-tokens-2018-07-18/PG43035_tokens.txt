preface
in
so
far
as
the
collection
of
information
is
concerned
the
advantages
of
travel
may
often
be
so
much
has
been
written
so
many
facts
are
upon
record
about
every
country
even
the
most
remote
that
a
judicious
and
persevering
study
of
existing
materials
would
no
doubt
enable
a
reader
to
fill
himself
with
knowledge
almost
to
repletion
without
leaving
his
chair
but
for
the
formation
of
opinion
for
the
stirring
and
enlivenment
of
thought
and
for
the
discernment
of
colour
and
proportion
the
gifts
of
travel
especially
of
travel
on
foot
are
priceless
it
was
with
the
design
and
in
the
hope
of
securing
such
prizes
that
i
undertook
last
year
the
pilgrimage
of
which
these
pages
give
account
i
can
not
tell
whether
i
have
succeeded
in
winning
them
and
still
less
whether
if
won
they
are
transferable
i
therefore
view
these
letters
with
a
modest
eye
they
were
written
mainly
in
long
hot
uganda
afternoons
after
the
day
march
was
done
the
larger
portion
has
already
appeared
in
the
and
what
has
been
added
was
necessary
to
complete
the
story
they
present
a
continuous
narrative
of
the
lighter
side
of
what
was
to
me
a
very
delightful
and
inspiring
journey
and
it
is
in
the
hope
that
they
may
vivify
and
fortify
the
interest
of
the
british
people
in
the
wonderful
estates
they
have
recently
acquired
in
the
northeastern
quarter
of
africa
that
i
offer
them
in

as
she
rises
from
the
sea
and
clothes
herself
with
form
and
colour
at
the
swift
approach
of
the
ship
is
alluring
and
even
delicious
but
to
appreciate
all
these
charms
the
traveller
should
come
from
the
north
he
should
see
the
hot
stones
of
malta
baking
and
glistening
on
a
mediterranean
he
should
visit
the
island
of
cyprus
before
the
autumn
rains
have
revived
the
soil
when
the
messaoria
plain
is
one
broad
wilderness
of
dust
when
every
tree
be
it
only
a
is
an
heirloom
and
every
drop
of
water
is
a
jewel
he
should
walk
for
two
hours
at
midday
in
the
streets
of
port
said
he
should
thread
the
long
red
furrow
of
the
suez
canal
and
swelter
through
the
trough
of
the
red
sea
he
should
pass
a
day
among
the
cinders
of
aden
and
a
week
among
the
scorched
rocks
and
stones
of
northern
somaliland
and
then
after
five
days
of
open
sea
his
eye
and
mind
will
be
prepared
to
salute
with
feelings
of
grateful
delight
these
shores
of
vivid
and
exuberant
green
on
every
side
is
vegetation
moist
tumultuous
and
varied
great
trees
clad
in
dense
foliage
shrouded
in
creepers
springing
from

here
we
are

the

whatever
may

which
civilized

will
draw
from
the
enormous

between

whatever

of
the
numerous
populations
comprised
within
those
limits
it
is
along
the
unpretentious
jetty
of
kilindini
that
the
whole
traffic
must
pass
for
kilindini
or
mombasa
as
i
may
be
permitted
to
call
it
is
the
of
one
of
the
most
romantic
and
most
wonderful
railways
in
the
world
the
two
iron
streaks
of
rail
that
wind
away
among
the
hills
and
foliage
of
mombasa
island
do
not
break
their
smooth
monotony
until
after
piercing
equatorial
forests
stretching
across
immense
prairies
and
climbing
almost
to
the
level
of
the
european
they
pause
and
that
only
for
a
time
upon
the
edges
of
the
great
lake
and
thus
is
made
a
sure
swift
road
along
which
the
white
man
and
all
that
he
brings
with
him
for
good
or
ill
may
penetrate
into
the
heart
of
africa
as
easily
and
safely
as
he
may
travel
from
london
to
vienna
short
has
been
the
life
many
the
vicissitudes
of
the
uganda
railway
the
adventurous
enterprise
of
a
liberal
government
it
was
soon
exposed
disowned
to
the
merciless
criticism
of
its
parents
adopted
as
a
cherished
foundling
by
the
conservative
party
it
almost
perished
from
mismanagement
in
their
hands
nearly
ten
thousand
pounds
a
mile
were
expended
upon
its
construction
and
so
eager
were
all
parties
to
be
done
with
it
and
its
expense
that
instead
of
pursuing
its
proper
and
natural
route
across
the
plateau
to
the
deep
waters
of
port
victoria
it
fell
by
the
way
into
the
shallow
gulf
of
kavirondo
lucky
to
get
so
far
it
is
easy
to
censure
it
is
impossible
not
to
criticize
the
administrative
mistakes
and
miscalculations
which
tarnished
and
nearly
marred
a
brilliant
conception
but
it
is
still
more
easy
as
one
traverses
in
hours
countries
which
ten
years
ago
would
have
baffled
the
toilsome
marches
of
many
weeks
to
underrate
the
difficulties
in
which
unavoidable
ignorance
and
astonishing
conditions
plunged
the
pioneers
the
british
art
of
muddling
through
is
here
seen
in
one
of
its
finest
expositions
through
everything
through
the
forests
through
the
ravines
through
troops
of
marauding
lions
through
famine
through
war
through
five
years
of
excoriating
parliamentary
debate
muddled
and
marched
the
railway
and
here
at
last
in
some
more
or
less
effective
fashion
is
it
arrived
at
its
goal
other
nations
project
central
african
railways
as
lightly
and
as
easily
as
they
lay
down
naval
programmes
but
here
is
a
railway
like
the
british
fleet
in
being
not
a
paper
plan
or
an
airy
dream
but
an
iron
fact
grinding
along
through
the
jungle
and
the
plain
waking
with
its
whistles
the
silences
of
the
nyanza
and
startling
the
tribes
out
of
their
primordial
nakedness
with
americani
piece
goods
in
let
us
then
without
waiting
in
mombasa
longer
than
is
necessary
to
wish
it
well
and
to
admire
the
fertility
and
promise
of
the
coastal
region
ascend
this
railway
from
the
sea
to
the
lake
and
first
what
a
road
it
is
everything
is
in
order
the
track
is
smoothed
and
weeded
and
ballasted
as
if
it
were
the
london
and
every
has
its
number
every
mile
every
hundred
yards
every
change
of
gradient
has
its
mark
not
in
soft
wood
to
feed
the
white
ant
but
in
hard
iron
constant
labour
has
steadily
improved
the
grades
and
curves
of
the
and
the
train
one
of
those
comfortable
practical
indian
trains
rolls
along
as
evenly
as
upon
a
european
line
nor
should
it
be
supposed
that
this
high
standard
of
maintenance
is
not
warranted
by
the
present
financial
position
of
the
line
the
uganda
railway
is
already
doing
what
it
was
never
expected
within
any
reasonable
period
to
do
it
is
paying
its
way
it
is
beginning
to
yield
a
profit
albeit
a
small
profit
upon
its
capital
charge
projected
solely
as
a
political
railway
to
reach
uganda
and
to
secure
british
predominance
upon
the
upper
nile
it
has
already
achieved
a
commercial
value
instead
of
the
annual
deficits
upon
working
expenses
which
were
regularly
anticipated
by
those
most
competent
to
judge
there
is
already
a
substantial
profit
of
nearly
eighty
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
this
is
but
the
beginning
and
an
imperfect
beginning
for
at
present
the
line
is
only
a
trunk
without
its
necessary
limbs
and
feeders
without
its
head
at
kilindini
without
its
full
tale
of
steamers
on
the
lake
above
all
without
its
natural
and
necessary
extension
to
the
albert
nyanza
illustration
on
the
currie
marsh
wilson
sir
mr
churchill
we
may
divide
the
journey
into
four
main
stages
the
jungles
the
plains
the
mountains
and
the
lake
for
the
lake
is
an
essential
part
of
the
railway
and
a
natural
and
inexpensive
extension
to
its
length
in
the
early
morning
then
we
start
from
mombasa
station
taking
our
places
upon
an
ordinary
garden
seat
fastened
on
to
the
of
the
engine
from
which
position
the
whole
country
can
be
seen
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
are
still
upon
mombasa
island
and
then
the
train
crossing
the
intervening
channel
by
a
long
iron
bridge
addresses
itself
in
earnest
to
the
continent
of
africa
into
these
vast
regions
the
line
winds
perseveringly
upon
a
stiff
and
the
land
unfolds
itself
ridge
after
ridge
and
valley
after
valley
till
soon
with
one
farewell
glance
at
the
sea
and
at
the
of
his
majesty
ship
rising
queerly
amid
the
palms
we
are
embraced
and
engulfed
completely
all
day
long
the
train
runs
upward
and
westward
through
broken
and
undulating
ground
clad
and
encumbered
with
vegetation
beautiful
birds
and
butterflies
fly
from
tree
to
tree
and
flower
to
flower
deep
ragged
gorges
filled
by
streams
in
flood
open
out
far
below
us
through
glades
of
palms
and
trees
here
and
there
at
intervals
which
will
become
shorter
every
year
are
plantations
of
rubber
fibre
and
cotton
the
beginnings
of
those
inexhaustible
supplies
which
will
one
day
meet
the
yet
unmeasured
demand
of
europe
for
those
indispensable
commodities
every
few
miles
are
little
trim
stations
with
their
signals
and
complete
and
all
of
a
pattern
backed
by
impenetrable
bush
in
brief
one
slender
thread
of
scientific
civilization
of
order
authority
and
arrangement
drawn
across
the
primeval
chaos
of
the
world
in
the
evening
a
cooler
crisper
air
is
blowing
the
humid
coast
lands
with
their
glories
and
their
fevers
have
been
left
behind
at
an
altitude
of
four
thousand
feet
we
begin
to
laugh
at
the
equator
the
jungle
becomes
forest
not
less
luxuriant
but
distinctly
different
in
character
the
olive
replaces
the
palm
the
whole
aspect
of
the
land
is
more
friendly
more
familiar
and
no
less
fertile
after
makindu
station
the
forest
ceases
the
traveller
enters
upon
a
region
of
grass
immense
fields
of
green
pasture
withered
and
whitened
at
this
season
by
waiting
for
the
rains
intersected
by
streams
and
watercourses
densely
wooded
with
dark
trees
and
scrub
and
relieved
by
bold
upstanding
bluffs
and
ridges
comprise
the
new
panorama
and
here
is
presented
the
wonderful
and
unique
spectacle
which
the
uganda
railway
offers
to
the
european
plains
are
crowded
with
wild
from
the
windows
of
the
carriage
the
whole
zoological
gardens
can
be
seen
disporting
itself
herds
of
antelope
and
gazelle
troops
of
zebras
sometimes
four
or
five
hundred
together
watch
the
train
pass
with
placid
assurance
or
scamper
a
hundred
yards
farther
away
and
turn
again
many
are
quite
close
to
the
line
with
one
can
see
that
it
is
the
same
everywhere
and
can
distinguish
long
files
of
black
wildebeeste
and
herds
of
red
kongoni
the
hartebeeste
of
south
africa
and
wild
ostriches
walking
sedately
in
twos
and
threes
and
every
kind
of
small
deer
and
gazelle
the
zebras
come
close
enough
for
their
stripes
to
be
admired
with
the
naked
eye
we
have
arrived
at
simba
the
place
of
lions
and
there
is
no
reason
why
the
passengers
should
not
see
one
or
even
stalking
across
the
plain
respectfully
observed
by
lesser
beasts
indeed
in
the
early
days
it
was
the
custom
to
stop
and
sally
out
upon
the
royal
vermin
whenever
met
with
and
many
the
lion
that
has
been
carried
back
to
the
tender
in
triumph
before
the
guard
or
driver
or
any
one
else
could
think
of
timetables
or
the
block
system
or
the
other
inconvenient
restrictions
of
a
regular
service
farther
up
the
line
in
the
twilight
of
the
evening
we
saw
not
a
hundred
yards
away
a
dozen
giraffes
lollopping
off
among
scattered
trees
and
at
nakuru
six
yellow
lions
walked
in
leisurely
mood
across
the
rails
in
broad
daylight
only
the
rhinoceros
is
absent
or
rarely
seen
and
after
one
of
his
species
had
measured
his
strength
unsuccessfully
against
an
engine
he
has
confined
himself
morosely
to
the
and
to
the
undisturbed
solitudes
which
at
a
distance
of
two
or
three
miles
everywhere
engulf
the
uganda
railway
our
carriage
stopped
upon
a
siding
at
simba
station
for
three
days
in
order
that
we
might
more
closely
examine
the
local
fauna
one
of
the
best
ways
of
shooting
game
in
this
part
of
the
world
and
certainly
the
easiest
is
to
get
a
trolly
and
run
up
and
down
the
line
the
animals
are
so
used
to
the
passage
of
trains
and
natives
along
the
one
great
highway
that
they
do
not
as
a
rule
take
much
notice
unless
the
train
or
trolly
stops
when
their
suspicions
are
at
once
aroused
the
sportsmen
should
therefore
slip
off
without
allowing
the
vehicle
or
the
rest
of
the
party
to
stop
even
for
a
moment
and
in
this
way
he
will
frequently
find
himself
within
two
hundred
and
fifty
or
three
hundred
yards
of
his
quarry
when
the
result
will
be
governed
solely
by
his
skill
or
want
of
skill
with
the
rifle
there
is
another
method
which
we
tried
on
the
second
day
in
the
hopes
of
finding
a
waterbuck
and
that
is
to
prowl
about
among
the
trees
and
undergrowth
of
the
in
a
few
minutes
one
may
bury
oneself
in
the
wildest
and
savagest
kind
of
forest
the
air
becomes
still
and
hot
the
sun
seems
in
an
instant
to
assert
his
just
prerogative
the
heat
glitters
over
the
open
spaces
of
dry
sand
and
pools
of
water
high
grass
huge
boulders
tangled
vegetation
multitudes
of
obstruct
the
march
and
the
ground
itself
is
scarped
and
guttered
by
the
rains
into
the
strangest
formations
around
you
overhead
rises
the
african
jungle
there
is
a
brooding
silence
broken
only
by
the
cry
of
a
bird
or
the
scolding
bark
of
baboons
and
the
crunching
of
one
own
feet
on
the
crumbling
soil
we
enter
the
haunt
of
the
wild
beasts
their
tracks
their
traces
the
remnants
of
their
repasts
are
easily
and
frequently
discovered
here
a
lion
has
passed
since
the
morning
there
a
rhinoceros
has
certainly
been
within
the
hour
perhaps
within
ten
minutes
we
creep
and
scramble
through
the
game
paths
anxiously

at
full
cock
not
knowing
what
each
turn
or
step
may
reveal
the
wind
when
it
blows
at
all
blows
fitfully
now
from
this
quarter
now
from
that
so
that
one
can
never
be
certain
that
it
will
not
betray
the
intruder
in
these
grim
domains
to
the
beast
he
seeks
or
to
some
other
less
welcome
before
he
sees
him
at
length
after
two
hours
scramble
and
scrape
we
emerge
breathless
as
from
another
world
half
astonished
to
find
ourselves
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
railway

its
trolly

illustration
the
rhinoceros
at
simba
but
if
one
would
seek
the
rhinoceros
in
his
open
pastures
it
is
necessary
to
go
farther
afield
and
accordingly
we
started
the
next
morning
while
the
stars
were
still
shining
to
tramp
over
the
ridges
and
hills
which
shut
in
the
railway
and
overlook
remoter
plains
and
valleys
beyond
the
grass
grows
high
from
ground
honeycombed
with
holes
and
heaped
with
lava
boulders
and
it
was
daylight
before
we
had
stumbled
our
way
to
a
spur
commanding
a
wide
view
here
we
halted
to
search
the
country
with
and
to
brush
off
the
ticks
detestable
insects
which
infest
all
the
resorts
of
the
game
in
innumerable
swarms
ready
to
spread
any
poison
among
the
farmers
cattle
the
glass
disclosed
nothing
of
consequence
zebra
wildebeeste
and
kongoni
were
to
be
seen
in
troops
and
herds
scattered
near
and
far
over
the
plains
but
never
a
rhinoceros
so
we
trudged
on
meaning
to
make
a
wide
circle
for
an
hour
we
found
nothing
and
then
just
as
we
were
thinking
of
turning
homewards
before
the
sun
should
get
his
full
power
three
beautiful
oryx
great
antelope
with
very
long
corrugated
horns
walked
over
the
next
brow
on
their
way
to
water
forthwith
we
set
off
in
pursuit
crouching
and
creeping
along
the
valley
and
hoping
to
intercept
them
at
the
stream
two
passed
safely
over
before
we
could
reach
our
point
the
third
seeing
us
turned
back
and
disappeared
over
the
hill
where
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
was
stalked
and
wounded
it
is
always
the
wounded
beast
that
leads
the
hunter
into
adventures

the
quarry
is
hit

one

a
cautiously
notices
a
convenient
tree
looks
often
this
way
and
that
but
once
the
prize
is
almost
within
reach
you
scramble
along
after
it
as
fast
as
your
legs
will
carry
you
and
never
trouble
about
remoter
contingencies
be
they
what
they
may
our
oryx
led
us
a
mile
or
more
over
rocky
slopes
always
promising
and
never
giving
a
good
chance
for
a
shot
until
at
last
he
drew
us
round
the
shoulder
of
a
hill
and
there
abruptly
was
the
rhinoceros
the
impression
was
extraordinary
a
wide
plain
of
white
withered
grass
stretched
away
to
low
hills
broken
with
rocks
the
rhinoceros
stood
in
the
middle
of
this
plain
about
five
hundred
yards
away
in
silhouette
not
a
animal
at
all
but
an
odd
grim
straggler
from
the
stone
age
he
was
grazing
placidly
and
above
him
the
vast
snow
dome
of
kilimanjaro
towered
up
in
the
clear
air
of
morning
to
complete
a
scene
unaltered
since
the
dawn
of
the
world
the
manner
of
killing
a
rhinoceros
in
the
open
is
crudely
simple
it
is
thought
well
usually
to
select
the
neighbourhood
of
a
good
tree
one
can
be
as
the
centre
of
the
encounter
if
no
tree
is
available
you
walk
up
as
near
as
possible
to
him
from
any
side
except
the
windward
and
then
shoot
him
in
the
head
or
the
heart
if
you
hit
a
vital
spot
as
sometimes
happens
he
falls
if
you
hit
him
anywhere
else
he
charges
blindly
and
furiously
in
your
direction
and
you
shoot
him
again
or
not
as
the
case
may
be
bearing
all
this
carefully
in
mind
we
started
out
to
do
battle
with
behemoth
we
had
advanced
perhaps
two
hundred
yards
towards
him
when
a
cry
from
one
of
the
natives
arrested
us
we
looked
sharply
to
the
right
there
not
a
hundred
and
fifty
paces
distant
under
the
shade
of
a
few
small
trees
stood
two
other
monsters
in
a
few
more
steps
we
should
have
tainted
their
wind
and
brought
them
up
with
a
rush
and
suppose
this
had
happened
when
perhaps
we
were
already
compromised
with
our
first
friend
and
had
him
wounded
and
furious
on
our
hands
luckily
warned
in
time
to
creep
back
to
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
to
skirt
its
crest
and
to
emerge
a
hundred
and
twenty
yards
from
this
new
objective
was
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
we
hurriedly
agree
to
kill
one
first
before
touching
the
other
at
such
a
range
it
is
easy
to
hit
so
great
a
target
but
the
is
small
i
fired
the
thud
of
a
bullet
which
strikes
with
an
impact
of
a
ton
and
a
quarter
tearing
through
hide
and
muscle
and
bone
with
the
hideous
energy
of
cordite
came
back
distinctly
the
large
rhinoceros
started
stumbled
turned
directly
towards
the
sound
and
the
blow
and
then
bore
straight
down
upon
us
in
a
peculiar
trot
nearly
as
fast
as
a
horse
gallop
with
an
activity
surprising
in
so
huge
a
beast

instinct
with
unmistakable

where
a

there
that
the

that

remain
before

must
be

there
is

after

it

who
have
forced

murderous

shall

side

is

for
this

i
perceive
that
stunned
and
dazed
by
the
frightful

has
swerved

have
come
together
with

rifles
somalis
and
all
the
other
accessories
some
zebras
and
kongoni
have
been
killed
and
left
lying
in
places
to
attract
the
lions
and
at
rain
or
shine
we
are
to
go
and
look
for
them

nothing

is
worn
the
skin
exposed
to

thorns
and
insects
becomes
almost
as
dark
as
that
of
the
natives
and
so
hardened
that
it
is
nothing
to
ride
all
day
with
bare
knees
on
the
saddle
a
truly
spartan
discipline
from
which
at
least
the
visitor
may
be
excused
this
is
the
way
in
which
they
hunt
lions
first
find
the
lion
lured
to
a
kill
driven
from
a
or
kicked
up
incontinently
by
the
way
once
viewed
he
must
never
be
lost

of
for
a

more
or
less

through

undergrowth
turning
him
shepherding
him
heading
him
this
way
and
that
until
he
is
brought
to
bay
for
his
part
the
lion
is
no
seeker
of
quarrels
he
is
often
described
in
accents
of
contempt
his
object
throughout
is
to
save
his
skin
if
being
unarmed
you
meet
six
or
seven
lions
unexpectedly
all
you
need
do
according
to
my
information
is
to
speak
to
them
sternly
and
they
will
slink
away
while
you
throw
a
few
stones
at
them
to
hurry
them
up
all
the
highest
authorities
recommend
this
but
when
pursued
from
place
to
place
chased
hither
and
thither
by
the
wheeling
horsemen
the
naturally
mild
disposition
of
the
lion
becomes
embittered
first
he
begins
to
growl
and
roar
at
his
enemies
in
order
to
terrify
them
and
make
them
leave
him
in
peace
then
he
darts
little
short
charges
at
them
finally
when
every
attempt
at
peaceful
persuasion
has
failed
he
pulls
up
abruptly
and
offers
battle
once
he
has
done
this
he
will
run
no
more
he
means
to
fight
and
to
fight
to
the
death
he
means
to
charge
home
and
when
a
lion
maddened
with
the
agony
of
a
distressed
by
long
and
hard
pursuit
or
most
of
all
a
lioness
in
defence
of
her
cubs
is
definitely
committed
to
the
charge
death
is
the
only
possible
conclusion
broken
limbs
broken
jaws
a
body
raked
from
end
to
end

pierced
through
and
through
entrails
torn
and

none
of
these
count
it
must
be
death
instant
and
utter
for
the
lion
or
down
goes
the
man
mauled
by
septic
claws
and
fetid
teeth
crushed
and
crunched
and
poisoned
afterwards
to
make
doubly
sure
such
are
the
habits
of
this
cowardly
and
wicked
animal
it
is
at
the
stage
when
the
lion
has
been
determinedly
bayed
that
the
sportsman
from
london
is
usually
introduced
upon
the
scene
he
has
we
may
imagine
followed
the
riders
as
fast
as
the
inequalities
of
the
ground
his
own
want
of
training
and
the
burden
of
a
heavy
rifle
will
allow
him
he
arrives
at
the
spot
where
the
lion
is
cornered
in
much
the
same
manner
as
the
matador
enters
the
arena
the
others
standing
aside
deferentially
ready
to
aid
him
or
divert
the
lion
if
his
bullet
kills
he
is
no
doubt
justly
proud
if
it
only
wounds
the
lion
charges
the
nearest
horseman
for
forty
yards
the
charge
of
a
lion
is
swifter
than
the
gallop
of
a
racehorse
the
riders
therefore
usually
avoid
waiting
within
that
distance
but
sometimes
they
do
not
or
sometimes
the
lion
sees
the
man
who
has
shot
him
or
sometimes
all
sorts
of
things
happen
which
make
good
stories
afterwards
after
this
general
description
no
particular
example
is
required
and
the
reader
need
not
be
disappointed
to
learn
that
our
lion
escaped
what
no
doubt
would
have
been
his
certain
destruction
by
the
breaking
of
a
single
link
in
the
regular
chain
of
circumstances
he
was
not
found
upon
the
kill
his
place
was
taken
by
a
filthy
hyena
and
it
was
not
until
we
had
beaten
thoroughly
for
two
hours
more
than
three
miles
of
that
we
saw
him
a
splendid
great
yellow
cat
looking
as
big
as
a
bullock
bounding
away
up
the
opposite
hill
off
started
our
riders
like
falcons
but
alas
if
alas
is
the
proper
word
a
deep
and
impassable
nullah
intervened
necessitating
large
circuits
and
long
delays
so
that
the
lion
got
clean
away
out
of
sight
of
all
men
and
we
were
reduced
to
the
slow
and
tedious
process
of
tracking
him
footprint
by
footprint
through
waving
grass
hour
after
hour
always
expecting
to
tread
on
his
tail

beating

awakened
the
weariest
sleeper

at
eight

began
the
whole
space
in

of
the
fort
was
densely
packed
with
naked
painted

and
gyrating
humanity
which
seethed
continually
to

it
is
unquestionably
an
advantage
that
the
east
african
negro
should
develop
a
taste
for
civilized
attire
in
no
more
useful
and
innocent
direction
could
his
wants
be
multiplied
and
his
desires
excited
and
it
is
by
this
process
of
assimilation
that
his
life
will
gradually
be
made
more
complicated
more
varied
less
crudely

and
himself
raised

it
would
surely
be
worth

to
organize
and
guide
this
new
motive

within
graceful
and
appropriate
limits
a
government
runs
risks
when
it
intrudes
upon
the
domain
of
fashion
but
when
a
veritable
abyss
of
knowledge
and
science
separates
the
rulers
from
the
ruled
when
authority
is
dealing
with
a
native
race
still
plunged
in
its
primary
squalour
without
religion
without
clothes
without
morals
but
willing
to
emerge
and
capable
of
emerging
such
risks
may
fairly
be
accepted
and
the
government
might
well
prescribe
or
present
suitable
robes
for
ceremonial
occasions
to
the
chiefs
and
gradually
encourage
and
more
gradually
still
enforce
their
adoption
throughout
the
population
after
the
dance
it
had
been
arranged
that
i
should
go
as
far
as
the
bank
of
the
tana
river
to
see
the
view
of
mount
kenya
and
then
return
to
the
thika
camp
before
night
but
when
the
whole
splendid
panorama
of
the
country
opened
upon
us
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
stop
short
of
the
promised
land
and
casting
away
material
cares
of
luncheon
and
baggage
i
decided
to
ride
through
to
embo
miles
from
fort
hall
and
our
most
advanced
post
in
this
direction
we
crossed
the
tana
by
a
ferry
which
travels
along
a
rope
under
the
impulsion
of
the
current
the
ponies
swam
the
deep
strong
stream
of
turbulent
red
water
on
the
farther
bank
the
country
is
really
magnificent
in
quality
and
aspect
the
centre
of
the
picture
is
always
mount
kenya
but
there
never
was
a
mountain
which
made
so
little
of
its
height
it
rises
by
long
gentle
slopes
more
like
a
swelling
of
ground
than
a
peak
from
an
immense
upland
plain
and
so
gradual
is
the
acclivity
that
but
for
the
sudden
outcrop
of
rock
which
crowns
the
summit
no
one
would
believe
it
over
eighteen
thousand
feet
high
it
is
its
gradual
rise
that
imparts
so
great
a
value
to
this
noble
mountain
for
about
its
enormous
base
and
upon
its
slopes
traversed
by
hundreds
of
streams
of
clear
perennial
water

grows

may
grow
in
successive
concentric
belts

kind
of
crop

is
superb

beauty
in
fertility
in
verdure

the
coolness
of
the
air
in
the
abundance
of
running
water
in
its
rich
red
soil
in
the
variety
of
its
vegetation
the
scenery
about
kenya
far
surpasses
anything
i
have
ever
seen
in
india
or
south
africa
and
challenges
comparison
with
the
fairest
countries
of
europe
indeed
looking
at
it
with
an
eye
fresh
from
italy
i
was
most
powerfully
reminded
of
the
upper
valleys
of
the
po
we
rode
on
all
day
through
this
delicious
country
along
a
native
road
smooth
enough
for
a
bicycle
except
where
it
crossed
stream
after
stream
on
primitive
bridges
on
every
side
the
soil
was
cultivated
and
covered
with
the
crops
of
a
large
and
industrious
population
it
is
only
a
year
since
regular
control
was
established
beyond
the
tana
not
without
some
bloodshed
by
a
small
military
expedition
yet
so
peaceful
are
the
tribes
now
that
their
intertribal
fighting
has
been
stopped
that
white
officers
ride
freely
about
among
their
villages
without
even
carrying
a
pistol
all
the
natives
met
with
on
the
road
were
armed
with
sword
and
spear
and
all
offered
us
their
customary
salutations
while
many
came
up
smiling
and
holding
out
long
moist
hands
for
me
to
shake
till
i
had
quite
enough
of
it
indeed
the
only
dangers
of
the
road
appear
to
be
from
the
buffaloes
which
infest
the
country
and
after
nightfall
place
the
traveller
in
real
peril
we
were
very
glad
for
this
reason
and
also
because
we
had
eaten
nothing
but
a
banana
each
since
early
morning
to
see
at
last
on
the
top
of
the
next
hill
the
buildings
of
embo
just
as
the
sun
sank
beneath
the
horizon
embo
is
a
model
station
only
five
months
old
one
small
house
for
the

commissioner
one
for

military
officer
an
office
and

tiny
jail

in

shops
in

iron
and
seven
or
eight
long
rows
of
beehive

and

and

young

officers

of
authority
far
from
the
telegraph
over
the
peace
and
order
of
an
area
as
large
as
an
english
county
and
regulate
the
conduct
and
fortunes
of
some
thousand
natives
who
have
never
previously
known
or
acknowledged
any
law
but
violence
or
terror
they
were
uncommonly
surprised
to
see
four
horsemen
come
riding
up
the
zigzag
path
to
their
dwelling
but
their
astonishment
was
no
bar
to
their
hospitality
and
we
were
soon
rewarded
for
our
journey
and
our
fasting
in
most
excellent
fashion
i
had
just
time
before
the
darkness
flooded
the
land
and
blotted
out
the
mighty
mountain
and
its
wreaths
of
cloud
to
walk
round
this
station
the
jail
consisted
of
a
single
room
barred
and
bolted
inside
not
a
prisoner
was
to
be
seen
i
inquired
where
they
were
and
was
shown
two
little
groups
seated
round
fires
in
the
open
they
were
chained
together
by
a
light
running
chain
and
after
a
hard
miscellaneous
work
about
the
station
they
chatted
peacefully
as
they
cooked
and
ate
their
evening
meal
the
prison
was
only
their
shelter
for
the
night
primitive
arrangements
no
doubt
but
are
they
more
barbarous
than
the
hideous
precision
of
an
english
convict
establishment
the
african
protectorates
now
administered
by
the
colonial
office
afford
rare
scope
for
the
abilities
of
earnest
and
intelligent
youth
a
man
of
may
easily
find
himself
ruling
a
large
tract
of
country
and
a
numerous
population
the
government
is
too
newly
established
to
have
developed
the
highly
centralized
and
closely
knit
perhaps
too
closely
knit
hierarchy
and
control
of
the
indian
system
it
is
far
too
poor
to
afford
a
complete
administration
the
district
commissioner
must
judge
for
himself
and
be
judged
upon
his
actions
very
often
for
tropical
diseases
make
many
gaps
in
the
ranks
and
men
must
often
return
to
england
to
recruit
their
health
the
officer
is
not
a
district
commissioner
at
all
but
a
junior
acting
in
his
stead
or
in
some
one
stead
sometimes
for
a
year
or
more
to
him
there
come
day
by
day
the
natives
of
the
district
with
all
their
troubles
disputes
and
intrigues
their
growing
appreciation
of
the
impartial
justice
of
the
tribunal
leads
them
increasingly
to
carry
all
sorts
of
cases
to
the
district
commissioner
court
when
they
are
ill
they
come
and
ask
for
medicine
when
they
are
wounded
in
their
quarrels
it
is
to
the
white
man
they
go
to
have
the
injuries
dressed
disease
and
accident
have
to
be
combated
without
professional
skill
courts
of
justice
and
forms
of
legality
must
be
maintained
without
lawyers
taxes
have
to
be
collected
by
personal
influence
peace
has
to
be
kept
with
only
a
shadow
of
force
all
these
great
opportunities
of
high
service
and
many
others
are
often
and
daily
placed
within
the
reach
of
men
in
their
twenties
on
the
whole
with
admirable
results
it
was
most
pleasant
to
hear
with
what
comprehension
and
sympathy
the
officers
of
the
east
africa
protectorate
speak
about
their
work
and
how
they
regard
themselves
as
the
guardians
of
native
interests
and
native
rights
against
those
who
only
care
about
exploiting
the
country
and
its
people
no
one
can
travel
even
for
a
little
while
among
the
kikuyu
tribes
without
acquiring
a
liking
for
these
tractable
if
brutish
children
or
without
feeling
that
they
are
capable
of
being
instructed
and
raised
from
their
present
degradation
there
are
more
than
four
million
aboriginals
in
east
africa
alone
their
care
imposes
a
grave
and
i
think
an
inalienable
responsibility
upon
the
british
government
it
will
be
an
ill
day
for
these
native
races
when
their
fortunes
are
removed
from
the
impartial
and
august
administration
of
the
crown
and
abandoned
to
the
fierce
of
a
small
white
population
such
an
event
is
no
doubt
very
remote
yet
the
speculator
the
planter
and
the
settler
are
knocking
at
the
door
there
are
many
things
which
ought
to
be
done
good
wise
scientific
and
justly
profitable
if
the
government
can
not
find
the
money
to
develop
the
natural
economic
strength
of
the
country
to
make
its
communications
to
start
its
industries
can
it
with
any
reason
bar
the
field
to
private
enterprise
can
it
prevent
the
ingress
of
a
white
population
ought
it
to
do
so
and
for
how
long
what
is
to
happen
when
there
are
thirty
thousand
white
people
in
east
africa
instead
of
the
three
thousand
or
so
who
make
so
much
stir
at
the
present
time
perhaps
the
course
of
these
chapters
will
lead
us
back
again
to
these
questions
i
am
very
doubtful
whether
it
will
supply
their
answers
we
have
a
discussion
in
the
evening
on
a
much
more
manageable
subject
the
district
commissioner
at
embo
has
been
ordered
by
the
high
court
of
the
protectorate
to
retry
a
criminal
case
which
he
had
settled
some
months
before
on
account
of
an
informality
in
the
report
of
the
proceedings
which
had
excited
the
attention
of
the
revising
authority
it
is
pointed
out
that
neither
the
accused
nor
his
understand
or
can
ever
be
made
to
understand
the
meaning
of
this
repetition
of
a
trial
that
they
are
bewildered
that
their
confidence
in
their
personal
ruler
may
be
weakened
that
endless
practical
difficulties
for
instance
the
collection
of
witnesses
scattered
about
in
distant
villages
and
the
disquietude
caused
to
them
by
a
second
summons
from
the
strange
mysterious
power
called
government
arise
out
of
an
error
which
only
a
lawyer
could
detect
and
which
only
appears
upon
a
piece
of
paper
some
one
quaintly
says
a
young
civil
officer
who
has
ridden
over
with
us
forgot
to
say
in
the
right
place
i
ask
the
nature
of
the
bo
it
is
certainly
substantial
no
mention
was
made
in
the
report
of
the
trial
that
the
accused
was
given
the
opportunity
of
the
hostile
witnesses
therefore
although
this
was
in
fact
done
the
trial
is
held
to
be
no
trial
and
ordered
anew
now
here
is
again
a
balancing
of
disadvantages
but
without
here
examining
whether
a
simple
release
would
not
have
been
better
than
a
retrial
i
find
myself
plainly
on
the
side
of
the
bo
there
is
scarcely
anything
more
important
in
the
government
of
men
than
the
exact
i
will
even
say
the
pedantic
observance
of
the
regular
forms
by
which
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
accused
persons
is
determined
those
forms
are
designed
to
protect
the
prisoner
not
merely
from
the
consequences
of
honest
forgetfulness
in
his
judges
but
from
systematic
carelessness
and
possible
oppression
once
they
are
allowed
to
be
loosely
construed
the
whole
system
of
civilized
jurisprudence
begins
to
crumble
and
in
its
place
there
is
gradually
erected
a
practice
dependent
entirely
for
its
efficiency
and
fairness
upon
the
character
and
intelligence
of
the
individual
responsible
necessary
as
it
is
to
trust
to
personal
authority
in
the
control
of
native
races
of
the
lowest
standard
it
is
not
less
necessary
to
assign
limits
to
that
authority
and
above
all
to
place
the
simple
primary
rights
of
accused
persons
to
what
we
at
home
are
accustomed
to
call
a
fair
trial
outside
its
scope
nor
does
the
administrator
really
suffer
in
native
eyes
from
the
apparition
into
his
domain
of
superior
authority
the
tribesmen
see
that
their
ruler
to
them
the
man
of
soldiers
and
police
of
punishment
and
reward
is
himself
obedient
to
some
remote
external
force
and
they
wonder
what
that
mysterious
force
can
be
and
marvel
dimly
at
its
greatness
authority
is
enhanced
and
not
impaired
by
the
suggestion
of
immense
reserves
behind
and
above
the
immediate
ruler
strong
though
he
be
but
upon
this
as
upon
other
matters
it
is
not
necessary
for
every
one
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
and
even
lawyers
are
not
always
wise
on
our
homeward
ride
in
the
early
morning
we
passed
a
swahili
village
these
mohammedans
have
penetrated
deeply
and
established
themselves
widely
in
the
eastern
parts
of
africa
armed
with
a
superior
religion
and
strengthened
with
arab
blood
they
maintain
themselves
without
difficulty
at
a
far
higher
level
than
the
pagan
aboriginals
among
whom
they
live
their
language
has
become
a
sort
of
over
all
this
part
of
the
world
as
traders
they
are
welcomed
as
fighting
men
they
are
respected
and
as
sorcerers
they
are
feared
by
all
the
tribes
their
khan
had
supplied
us
with
bananas
on
the
previous
day
with
many
expressions
of
apology
that
as
we
were
unexpected
he
had
no
european
food
all
this
was
repaired
the
men
of
the
village
to
the
number
of
perhaps
fifty
walked
sedately
out
to
meet
us
their
long
white
smocks
in
striking
contrast
to
the
naked
painted
barbarians
who
surrounded
them
the
khan
led
up
a
white
arab
stallion
of
vicious
temper
and
tripling
gait
to
replace
my
wearied
pony
and
then
produced
tea
and
a
familiar
tin
of
mixed
biscuits
which
he
had
sent
runners
to
procure
that
his
hospitality
might
incur
no
reproach
while
we
were
eating
and
parleying
with
the
khan
there
arrived
on
the
scene
a
mounted
kikuyu
chief
with
chair
umbrella
khaki
helmet
and
other
insignia
and
attended
by
about
a
hundred
warriors
in
full
feather
in
order
to
show
their
respect
they
began
at
once
their
and
we
left
them
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
still
circling
and
hopping
to
and
fro
with
quivering
spears
and
nodding
plumes
to
their
monotonous
chorus
while
the
swahilis
stood
gravely
by
and
bade
us
farewell
in
the
dignified
manners
of
the
east
i
reflected
upon
the
interval
that
separates
these
two
races
from
each
other
and
on
the
centuries
of
struggle
that
the
advance
had
cost
and
i
wondered
whether
that
interval
was
wider
and
deeper
than
that
which
divides
the
modern
european
from
them
both
but
without
arriving
at
any
sure
conclusion
our
journey
to
embo
had
been
so
delightful
that
i
was
not
inclined
to
hanker
after
rejected
alternatives
but
when
we
drove
in
to
the
thika
camp
as
the
sun
was
setting
tired
out
by
fifty
miles
of
road
the
first
spectacle
which
saluted
my
eyes
was
a
lion
skin
spread
out
upon
the
ground
and
colonel
wilson
engaged
in
sprinkling
it
with
arsenical
powder
then
we
were
told
the
tale
which
in
brief
was
that
they
were
driving
a
long
when
the
lion
sprang
out
and
ran
obliquely
across
the
line
of
beaters
wilson
fired
and
the
lion
bounded
back
into
the
reeds
whence
stones
fires
shoutings
shots
and
all
other
disturbances
failed
to
move
him
whereupon
after
two
hours
being
impatient
and
venturesome
they
had
marched
in
upon
him
shoulder
to
shoulder
to
find
him
fortunately
quite
dead
my
friends
endeavoured
to
console
me
by
the
news
that
lions
had
now
been
heard
of
in
two
other
places
and
that
we
should
be
sure
to
find
one
in
the
morning
and
next
day
after
we
had
driven
three
miles
of
reeds
it
seemed
that
their
hopes
were
well
founded
for
a
large
animal
of
some
kind
could
be
seen
moving
swiftly
to
and
fro
under
cover
and
every
one
declared
this
must
be
the
lion
at
last
only
one
more
patch
of
reeds
remained
to
beat
and
we
took
up
our
positions
finger
on
trigger
about
sixty
yards
from
the
farther
edge
of
it
while
the
beaters
raising
an
astonishing
tumult
with
yells
and
the
beating
of
tin
cans
plunged
boldly
in
out
rushed
two
enormous
let
no
one
reproach
the
courage
of
the
pig
these
great
fierce
boars
driven
from
their
last
shelter
charged
out
in
gallant
style
tusks
gleaming
tails
perpendicular
and
met
a
fate
prepared
for
a
king
with
these
and
another
which
we
galloped
down
and
pistolled
on
the
way
home
i
had
to
be
content
and
can
now
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
sadly
write
in
the
expressive
words
of
reuter
no
lions
were
chapter
iii
the
highlands
of
east
africa
colour
is
already
the
dominant
question
at
nairobi
we
mean
to
make
east
africa
a
white
man
country
cries
in
strident
tones
the
colonists
association
on
every
occasion
truly
a
respectable
and
impressive
policy
but
one
which
seems
at
first
sight
rather
difficult
to
achieve
in
a
land
where
there
are
so
far
fewer
than
two
thousand
five
hundred
whites
and
more
than
four
million
black
aboriginals
can
east
africa
ever
become
a
white
man
country
can
even
the
highlands
with
their
cool
and
buoyant
breezes
and
temperate
unchanging
climate
become
a
white
man
country
never
certainly
in
the
sense
that
canada
or
indeed
the
united
kingdom
are
white
countries
that
is
to
say
countries
inhabited
wholly
by
white
people
and
subsisting
upon
an
economic
basis
of
white
unskilled
labour
it
is
scarcely
worth
while
even
to
imagine
the
highlands
of
east
africa
denuded
of
their
native
inhabitants
and
occupied
solely
by
europeans
such
an
idea
is
utterly
impossible
whatever
may
be
the
increase
in
the
white
population
in
the
future
it
is
safe
to
say
that
it
will
be
far
more
than
by
the
multiplication
of
the
natives
as
they
are
guarded
against
famine
and
prevented
from
civil
war
but
were
such
a
solution
possible
it
would
be
almost
the
last
thing
in
the
world
desired
by
those
who
clamour
for
a
white
country
for
observe
it
is
not
against
the
black
aboriginal
that
the
prejudices
and
interests
of
the
white
settler
or
trader
are
arrayed
the
african
it
is
conceded
is
welcome
to
stay
in
his
own
country
no
economic
competition
has
yet
arisen
or
is
likely
to
arise
between
him
and
the
their
spheres
of
activity
lie
wholly
apart
for
the
white
man
absolutely
refuses
to
do
black
man
work
not
for
that
harsh
toil
does
he
exile
himself
from
the
land
of
his
birth
while
the
native
could
not
in
his
present
state
of
development
displace
the
white
man
in
skilled
employments
and
the
superintendence
and
the
organization
of
industry
even
if
he
would
and
nothing
is
farther
from
his
ambitions
it
is
the
brown
man
who
is
the
rival
the
european
has
neither
the
wish
nor
the
power
to
constitute
a
white
proletariat
in
countries
like
east
africa
in
his
view
the
blacks
should
be
the
private
soldiers
of
the
army
but
the
officers
and
the
commanders
must
be
white
this
should
not
be
dismissed
as
a
mere
assertion
of
racial
arrogance
it
is
an
obstinate
fact
it
is
already
a
grave
defect
for
a
community
to
found
itself
upon
the
manual
labour
of
an
inferior
race
and
many
are
the
complications
and
perils
that
spring
therefrom
but
what
of
the
second
storey
if
there
is
to
be
any
kind
of
white
society
dwelling
together
year
after
year
within
the
standards
of
life
and
comfort
to
which
europeans
have
universally
been
accustomed
to
aspire
and
largely
to
attain
this
middle
stage
in
the
economic
system
must
provide
that
white
society
with
the
means
of
earning
as
professional
men
as
planters
merchants
traders
farmers
bankers
overseers
contractors
builders
engineers
accountants
clerks
a
living
for
themselves
and
their
families
and
here
strikes
in
the
asiatic
in
every
single
employment
of
this
class
his
power
of
subsisting
upon
a
few
shillings
a
month
his
industry
his
thrift
his
sharp
business
aptitudes
give
him
the
economic
superiority
and
if
economic
superiority
is
to
be
the
final
rule
as
it
has
never
been
and
never
will
be
in
the
history
of
the
world
there
is
not
a
single
employment
of
this
middle
class
from
which
he
will
not
to
a
very
large
extent
clear
the
white
man
as
surely
and
as
remorselessly
as
the
brown
rat
extirpated
the
black
from
british
soil
then
what
remains
what
sort
of
social
organizations
shall
we
be
building
up
with
so
much
thought
and
labour
in
these
new
lands
under
the
british
crown
there
is
already
no
white
working
class
there
is
to
be
no
white
middle
class
room
is
left
only
for
the
capitalist
and
if
one
may
so
describe
him
a
vast
army
of
african
labourers
officered
by
educated
indians
or
chinese
and
directed
by
a
few
individuals
of
diverse
nationalities
employing
cosmopolitan
capital
that
is
the
nightmare
which
haunts
the
white
population
of
south
africa
and
at
which
what
there
is
of
a
white
population
in
east
africa
is
already
shrieking
vigorously
yet
hear
the
other
side
how
stands
the
claim
of
the
british
indian
his
rights
as
a
human
being
his
rights
as
a
british
subject
are
equally
engaged
it
was
the
sikh
soldier
who
bore
an
honourable
part
in
the
conquest
and
pacification
of
these
east
african
countries
it
is
the
indian
trader
who
penetrating
and
maintaining
himself
in
all
sorts
of
places
to
which
no
white
man
would
go
or
in
which
no
white
man
could
earn
a
living
has
more
than
any
one
else
developed
the
early
beginnings
of
trade
and
opened
up
the
first
slender
means
of
communication
it
was
by
indian
labour
that
the
one
vital
railway
on
which
everything
else
depends
was
constructed
it
is
the
indian
banker
who
supplies
perhaps
the
larger
part
of
the
capital
yet
available
for
business
and
enterprise
and
to
whom
the
white
settlers
have
not
hesitated
to
recur
for
financial
aid
the
indian
was
here
long
before
the
first
british
official
he
may
point
to
as
many
generations
of
useful
industry
on
the
coast
and
inland
as
the
white
settlers
especially
the
most
contingents
from
south
africa
the
loudest
against
him
of
all
can
count
years
of
residence
is
it
possible
for
any
government
with
a
scrap
of
respect
for
honest
dealing
between
man
and
man
to
embark
upon
a
policy
of
deliberately
squeezing
out
the
native
of
india
from
regions
in
which
he
has
established
himself
under
every
security
of
public
faith
most
of
all
must
we
ask
is
such
a
policy
possible
to
the
government
which
bears
sway
over
three
hundred
millions
of
our
indian
empire
we
are
in
presence
of
one
of
those
apparently
hopeless
antagonisms
of
interests
which
baffle
and
dispirit
all
who
are
concerned
in
their
adjustment
and
these
questions
are
not
confined
to
east
africa
or
to
south
africa
a
whole
series
of
new
problems
has
arisen
and
will
grow
graver
and
larger
as
the
immediate
history
of
the
british
empire
unfolds
they
erect
themselves
upon
a
field
almost
wholly
unstudied
and
familiar
only
by
the
prejudices
which
in
every
direction
obstruct
movement
and
view
the
entry
of
the
asiatic
as
labourer
trader
and
capitalist
into
competition
in
industry
and
enterprise
not
only
but
the
western
world
is
a
new
fact
of
first
importance
cheap
swift
easy
means
of
communication
the
establishment
of
peace
and
order
over
land
and
sea
the
of
all
men
and
all
countries
upon
one
another
have
given
wings
to
asiatic
commercial
ambition
and
rendered
asiatic
manual
labour
fluid
as
it
has
never
before
been
fluid
since
the
beginning
of
things
unless
these
new
elements
in
the
economic
life
of
mankind
can
be
scientifically
and
harmoniously
controlled
and
assimilated
great
and
novel
dangers
menace
alike
the
asiatic
and
the
european
he
supplants
on
the
one
hand
we
see
the
possible
exploitation
under
various
unhealthy
conditions
of
immense
masses
of
asiatic
labour
to
the
moral
injury
of
the
employer
and
to
the
degradation
and
suffering
of
the
employed
on
the
other
the
overturn
of
the
standards
of
living
laboriously
achieved
or
long
obstinately
battled
for
among
europeans
superadded
to
these
we
must
foresee
the
confusion
of
blood
of
manners
of
morals
amounting
where
operative
upon
any
extensive
scale
almost
to
the
disintegration
of
the
existing
order
of
society
and
behind
very
close
behind
lie
the
appeals
to
force
by
mobs
or
empires
to
decide
in
a
brutal
fashion
the
brutal
question
which
of
two
sets
of
irreconcilable
interests
shall
prevail
it
is
not
easy
to
measure
the
degree
of
political
instability
that
will
be
introduced
into
international
relations
when
the
subjects
of
a
powerful
military
and
naval
state
are
continually
exposed
to
penal
legislation
and
open
violence
and
into
private
life
when
the
white
artisan
is
invited
to
acquiesce
in
his
own
extinction
in
virtue
of
laws
which
he
himself
controls
by
a
competitor
whom
he
believes
he
could
strike
down
with
his
hands
yet
the
asiatic
and
here
i
also
include
the
african
native
has
immense
services
to
render
and
energies
to
contribute
to
the
happiness
and
material
progress
of
the
world
there
are
spacious
lands
whose
promise
can
never
be
realized
there
are
unnumbered
harvests
which
can
never
be
garnered
without
his
active
there
are
roads
and
railways
and
reservoirs
which
only
he
can
make
there
are
mines
and
forests
which
will
slumber
for
ever
without
his
aid
the
mighty
continent
of
tropical
africa
lies
open
to
the
colonizing
and
organizing
capacities
of
the
east
all
those
new
products
which
modern
industry
insistently
demands
are
offered
in
measureless
abundance
to
the
west
if
only
we
could
solve
the
sphinx
riddle
in
its
newest
form
and
is
it
after
all
beyond
our
reach
to
provide
if
not
a
perfect
at
any
rate
a
practical
answer
there
ought
to
be
no
insuperable
difficulty
in
the
present
state
of
political
knowledge
and
social
organization
in
assigning
different
spheres
to
the
external
activity
of
different
races
the
great
powers
have
partitioned
africa
territorially
is
it
beyond
the
wit
of
man
to
divide
it
economically
the
of
many
different
kinds
of
men
is
needed
for
the
cultivation
of
such
a
noble
estate
is
it
impossible
to
regulate
in
full
and
intricate
detail
the
conditions
under
which
that
shall
take
place
here
white
men
can
live
and
thrive
there
they
can
not
here
is
a
task
for
one
there
the
opportunity
of
another
the
world
is
big
enough
i
write
as
the
stream
of
the
nile
bears
me
between
the
immense
spaces
of
beautiful
fertile
unpopulated
country
that
lie
north
of
the
albert
lake
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
all
why
can
not
we
settle
it
fairly
it
must
be
noted
that
the
question
of
asiatic
immigration
presents
itself
to
the
imperial
point
of
view
in
several
quite
distinct
forms
there
are
first
of
all
colonies
which
stand
on
the
basis
of
a
white
proletariat
and
whose
inhabitants
rich
and
poor
employers
and
employed
are
all
europeans
the
right
of
such
colonies
to
forbid
the
entry
of
large
numbers
of
asiatics
and
to
preserve
themselves
from
the
racial
chaos
and
economic
disturbance
inseparable
from
such
immigration
can
not
be
denied
although
its
exercise
ought
no
doubt
to
be
governed
by
various
prudential
and
other
considerations
but
these
colonies
differ
markedly
from
those
where
the
mass
of
the
population
is
not
white
but
black
again
there
are
colonies
which
possess
responsible
government
and
where
the
number
of
the
white
inhabitants
very
largely
exceeds
the
asiatic
community
it
is
evident
that
these
stand
in
a
wholly
different
position
from
that
of
places
like
the
tropical
protectorates
of
east
and
west
africa
indeed
it
may
be
contended
that
the
very
fact
that
the
native
of
british
india
will
undoubtedly
wisely
or
unwisely
rightly
or
wrongly
be
refused
access
in
any
large
numbers
to
several
south
african
and
all
australian
colonies
by
their
respective
governments
makes
it
all
the
more
desirable
that
the
imperial
government
should
afford
in
the
tropical
protectorates
outlet
and
scope
to
the
enterprise
and
colonizing
capacity
of
hindustan
and
as
i
have
written
these
countries
are
big
enough
for
all
there
is
no
reason
why
those
highland
areas
which
promise
the
white
man
a
home
and
a
career
and
where
alone
he
can
live
in
comfort
should
not
as
a
matter
of
practical
administration
be
in
the
main
reserved
for
him
nor
on
the
other
hand
why
the
asiatic
if
only
he
does
not
teach
the
african
natives
evil
ways
a
contingency
which
must
not
be
forgotten
should
not
be
encouraged
to
trade
and
settle
as
he
will
in
the
enormous
regions
of
tropical
fertility
to
which
he
is
naturally
adapted
somewhere
in
this
direction
i
do
not
wish
to
dogmatize
the
immediate
course
of
sound
policy
would
seem
to
lie
and
guided
by
the
lights
of
science
and
tolerance
we
may
easily
find
it
but
the
course
of
these
reflections
has
carried
me
a
good
deal
farther
than
the
politics
of
nairobi
would
seem
to
justify
and
i
hasten
to
return
to
the
question
with
which
i
started
can
the
highlands
of
east
africa
be
made
white
man
country
let
us
examine
this
by
a
fresh
process
as
one
rides
or
marches
through
the
valleys
and
across
the
wide
plateaux
of
these
uplands
braced
by
their
delicious
air
listening
to
the
music
of
their
streams
and
feasting
the
eye
upon
their
natural
wealth
and
beauty
a
sense
of
bewilderment
overcomes
the
mind
how
is
it
they
have
never
become
the
home
of
some
superior
race
prosperous
healthy
and
free
why
is
it
that
now
a
railway
has
opened
the
door
and
so
much
has
been
published
about
them
there
has
not
been
one
furious
river
of
immigration
from
the
cramped
and
insanitary
of
europe
why
most
of
all
are
those
who
have
come
the
pioneers
the
men
of
energy
and
adventure
of
large
ambitions
and
strong
hands
why
are
they
in
so
many
cases
only
just
keeping
their
heads
above
water
why
should
complaint
and
discontent
and
positive
discouragement
be
so
general
among
this
limited
class
i
have
always
experienced
a
feeling
of
devout
thankfulness
never
to
have
possessed
a
square
yard
of
that
perverse
commodity
called
land
but
i
will
confess
that
travelling
in
the
east
african
highlands
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
have
learned
what
the
sensation
of
is
like
we
may
repress
but
we
can
not
escape
the
desire
to
peg
out
one
of
these
fair
and
wide
estates
with
all
the
rewards
they
offer
to
industry
and
inventiveness
in
the
open
air
yet
all
around
are
men
possessing
thousands
of
fertile
acres
with
mountains
and
rivers
and
shady
trees
acquired
for
little
or
nothing
all
struggling
all
fretful
nervous
many
disappointed
some
despairing
some
smashed
what
are
the
true
lineaments
concealed
behind
the
veil
of
boundless
promise
in
which
this
land
is
shrouded
are
they
not
stamped
with
mockery
is
not
the
eye
that
regards
you
fierce
as
well
as
bright
when
i
first
saw
this
country
said
a
colonist
to
me
i
fell
in
love
with
it
i
had
seen
all
the
best
of
australia
i
had
prospered
in
new
zealand
i
knew
south
africa
i
thought
at
last
i
had
struck
own
country
i
wrote
letters
to
all
my
friends
urging
them
to
come
i
wrote
a
series
of
articles
in
the
newspapers
praising
the
splendours
of
its
scenery
and
the
excellence
of
its
climate
before
the
last
of
the
articles
appeared
my
capital
was
nearly
expended
my
fences
had
been
trampled
down
by
troops
of
zebra
my
imported
stock
had
perished
my
were
still
blocked
in
the
land
office
and
i
myself
had
nearly
died
of
a
malignant
fever
since
then
i
have
left
others
to
extol
the
glories
of
east
africa
these
second
thoughts
err
no
doubt
as
much
on
the
side
of
extravagant
depression
as
the
first
impression
was
but
that
there
is
a
rude
reverse
to
the
east
african
medal
is
a
fact
which
can
not
be
disputed
and
which
ought
not
in
the
interests
either
of
the
immigrant
or
of
the
country
to
be
concealed
it
is
still
quite
unproved
that
a
european
can
make
even
the
highlands
of
east
africa
his
permanent
home
that
is
to
say
that
he
can
live
there
without
sensible
degeneration
for
fifteen
or
twenty
years
at
a
stretch
without
ever
returning
to
the
temperate
zones
still
less
that
he
can
breed
and
rear
families
through
several
generations
the
exhilaration
of
the
air
must
not
lead
people
to
forget
that
an
altitude
of
from
five
to
eight
thousand
feet
above
the
is
an
unusual
condition
producing
results
not
yet
ascertained
upon
the
nervous
system
the
brain
and
the
heart
its
coolness
can
never
remove
the
fact
that
we
are
upon
the
equator
although
the
skies
look
so
familiar
and
kindly
with
their
white
fleecy
clouds
and
passing
showers
the
direct
ray
of
the
sun
almost
vertical
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
strikes
down
on
man
and
beast
alike
and
woe
to
the
white
man
whom
he
finds
uncovered
although
sheep
and
oxen
multiply
so
rapidly
although
crossing
them
with
imported
stock
produces
in
each
generation
astonishing
improvements
in
quality
they
are
subject
to
many
perils
little
understood
and
often
fatal
and
if
the
landscape
recalls
to
the
pensive
traveller
the
peaceful
beauties
of
gentler
climes
at
home
let
him
remember
that
it
nurses
with
blithe
fecundity
poisonous
reptiles
and
insects
and
terrible
beasts
of
prey
there
is
no
reason
however
for
doubting
that
modern
science
possesses
or
will
discover
the
means
of
eradicating
or
mitigating
many
of
these
evils
as
the
development
of
the
country
and
the
scientific
investigation
of
tropical
agriculture
and
tropical
disease
proceed
the
difficulties
which
beset
the
early
settler
will
gradually
be
removed
he
will
learn
how
to
clothe
and
house
himself
what
to
plant
what
to
breed
and
what
to
avoid
the
spread
of
east
coast
fever
now
carried
by
the
ticks
from
one
animal
to
another
and
carried
by
the
infected
animals
from
one
district
to
another
will
be
arrested
and
controlled
by
a
proper
system
of
and
quarantine
remedies
will
be
discovered
against
the
various
diseases
which
attack
sheep
or
horses
zebra
rhinoceros
buffalo
and
other
picturesque
and
fascinating
nuisances
will
be
driven
from
or
exterminated
within
the
settled
areas
and
confined
to
the
ample
reserves
of
uninhabited
land
the
slow
but
steady
growth
of
a
white
population
will
create
a
market
for
local
agricultural
produce
the
powerfully
equipped
scientific
departments
the
veterinary
and
forestry
departments
and
the
department
of
agriculture
newly
established
on
a
considerable
scale
will
be
able
to
guide
and
assist
the
enterprise
of
the
and
save
him
from
repeating
the
experiments
of
the
pioneer
roads
will
improve
and
railways
and
tramways
will
extend
step
by
step
life
and
the
means
of
living
will
become
easier
and
more
secure
still
it
will
not
be
proved
that
the
european
can
rear
his
children
under
the
equatorial
sun
and
at
an
elevation
of
more
than
six
thousand
feet
and
till
that
is
proved
the
white
man
country
will
remain
a
white
man
dream
i
have
written
of
europeans
and
asiatics
what
of
the
african
about
four
millions
of
these
dark
folk
are
comprised
within
the
districts
of
the
east
africa
protectorate
which
are
actually
or
partially
administered
many
more
lie
beyond
those
wide
and
advancing
boundaries
what
is
to
be
their
part
in
shaping
the
future
of
their
country
it
is
after
all
africa
what
are
they
going
to
do
for
it
and
what
is
it
going
to
do
for
them
the
natives
says
the
planter
evince
a
great
reluctance
to
work
especially
to
work
regularly
they
must
be
made
to
work
say
others
made
to
work
for
whom
we
innocently
ask
for
us
of
course
is
the
ready
answer
what
did
you
think
we
meant
and
here
we
run
into
another
herd
of
rhinoceros
questions
awkward
and
horned
with
a
short
sight
an
evil
temper
and
a
tendency
to
rush
blindly
up
wind
upon
any
alarm
is
the
native
idle
does
he
not
keep
himself
and
pay
his
taxes
or
does
he
loll
at
his
ease
while
his
three
or
four
wives
till
the
soil
bear
the
burden
and
earn
his
living
and
if
idle
has
he
a
right
to
remain
idle
a
naked
and
unconscious
philosopher
living
the
simple
life
without
cares
or
wants
a
gentleman
of
leisure
in
a
panting
world
is
that
to
be
the
last
word
is
civilization
to
say
definitely
that
when
the
african
native
has
kept
himself
or
made
his
women
keep
him
she
has
no
further
claim
upon
him
the
white
man
shall
do
the
rest
he
shall
preserve
the
peace
that
the
tribes
may
prosper
and
multiply
his
watchful
and
foreseeing
eye
strained
and
weary
with
the
effort
shall
still
make
provision
against
famine
his
science
though
he
himself
goes
down
in
the
struggle
shall
grapple
with
pestilence
and
cure
disease
far
from
his
home
or
from
his
family
he
shall
hew
the
trees
and
dig
the
wells
shall
dam
the
streams
and
build
the
roads
with
anxious
heart
and
in
the
sweat
of
his
brow
according
to
the
curse
laid
upon
the
child
of
many
wants
while
the
child
of
few
wants
watches
him
from
the
shade
and
thinks
him
mad
and
to
compare
the
life
and
lot
of
the
african
aboriginal
secure
in
his
abyss
of
contented
degradation
rich
in
that
he
lacks
everything
and
wants
nothing
with
the
long
nightmare
of
worry
and
privation
of
dirt
and
gloom
and
squalour
lit
only
by
gleams
of
torturing
knowledge
and
tantalizing
hope
which
constitutes
the
lives
of
so
many
poor
people
in
england
and
scotland
is
to
feel
the
ground
tremble
under
foot
it
would
never
do
to
have
a
lot
of
whites
in
this
country
i
heard
one
day
a
gentleman
say
it
would
destroy
the
respect
of
the
native
for
the
white
man
if
he
saw
what
miserable
people
we
have
got
at
home
so
here
at
any
rate
the
boot
is
on
the
other
leg
and
civilization
is
ashamed
of
her
arrangements
in
the
presence
of
a
savage
embarrassed
lest
he
should
see
what
lies
behind
the
gold
and
purple
robe
of
state
and
begin
to
suspect
that
the
white
man
is
a
fraud
but
this
is
an
irrelevancy
i
am
clearly
of
opinion
that
no
man
has
a
right
to
be
idle
whoever
he
be
or
wherever
he
lives
he
is
bound
to
go
forward
and
take
an
honest
share
in
the
general
work
of
the
world
and
i
do
not
except
the
african
native
to
a
very
much
larger
extent
than
is
often
recognized
by
some
who
discuss
these
questions
the
natives
are
industrious
willing
to
learn
and
capable
of
being
led
forward
live
for
a
few
weeks
as
i
have
done
in
close
association
with
the
disciplined
soldiers
of
the
king
african
rifles
or
with
the
smart
sailors
of
the
uganda
marine
and
it
seems
wonderful
to
contrast
them
with
the
population
from
which
they
have
emerged
how
strong
how
how
clever
they
are
how
proud
their
white
officers
are
of
them
what
pains
they
take
to
please
the
travellers
whom
they
escort
how
frankly
they
are
delighted
by
a
word
of
praise
or
thanks
just
and
honourable
discipline
careful
education
sympathetic
comprehension
are
all
that
is
needed
to
bring
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
native
tribes
of
east
africa
to
a
far
higher
social
level
than
that
at
which
they
now
stand
and
why
should
men
only
be
taught
to
be
soldiers
is
war
always
to
have
the
best
of
everything
can
not
peaceful
industry
be
made
as
attractive
be
as
highly
organized
as
carefully
studied
as
the
combined
use
of
deadly
weapons
why
as
ruskin
asks
can
not
men
take
pride
in
villages
instead
of
only
them
i
wonder
why
my
pen
slips
off
into
these
labyrinths
when
all
i
set
out
to
do
was
to
give
some
general
idea
of
politics
at
nairobi
but
in
truth
the
problems
of
east
africa
are
the
problems
of
the
world
we
see
the
social
racial
and
economic
stresses
which
rack
modern
society
already
at
work
here
but
in
miniature
and
if
we
choose
to
study
the
model
when
the
whole
engine
is
at
hand
it
is
because
on
the
smaller
scale
we
can
see
more
clearly
and
because
in
east
africa
and
uganda
the
future
is
still
uncompromised
the
british
government
has
it
in
its
hands
to
shape
the
development
and
destiny
of
these
new
countries
and
their
varied
peoples
with
an
authority
and
from
an
elevation
far
superior
to
that
with
which
cabinets
can
cope
with
the
giant
tangles

and
the
fact
stirs
the
mind
but
by
this
time
the
reader
will
have
had
as
much
of
east
african
politics
as
i
had
when
after
three
days
of
deputations
and
disputations
the
train
steamed
out
of
nairobi
to
take
us
to
the
great
lake
and
beyond

iv
the
great
lake
we
are
off
again
on
the
uganda
railway
interesting
and
beautiful
as
is
the
country
through
which
the
line
passes
from
mombasa
to
nairobi
it
is
surpassed
by
the
magnificent
scenery
of
the
journey
to
the
lake
first
in
order
and
in
rank
is
the
great
rift
this
curious
fault
in
the
earth
surface
which
geologists
trace
across
the
four
thousand
miles
of
land
and
sea
which
separate
us
from
palestine
and
onward
still
to
the
southern
end
of
lake
tanganyika
is
traversed
by
the
uganda
railway
at
one
of
its
most
remarkable
stages
for
sixty
miles
the
highland
plateau
has
been
rising
steadily
by
a
succession
of
wooded
undulations
to
a
level
of
over
six
thousand
feet
now
it
falls
abruptly
almost
precipitously
more
than
two
thousand
feet
this
frowning
wall
of
rock
and
forest
which
extends
straight
as
a
ruler
farther
than
eye
can
see
is
the
kikuyu
escarpment
as
the
train
claws
its
way
downwards
by
slant
and
zigzag
along
its
face
a
majestic
panorama
breaks
upon
the
view
far
below
bathed
in
sunshine
stretching
away
to
misty
purple
horizons
lie
the
broad
expanses
of
the
rift
valley
its
level
surface
is
broken
by
strangely
moulded
volcanic
hills
and
shattered
craters
the
opposite
mountain
wall
looms
up
in
the
far
distance
brown
and
blue
we
gaze
down
upon
the
plain
as
from
a
balloon
mistaking
forests
for
patches
of
green
grass
and
mighty
trees
for
illustration
the

from
the
kikuyu
escarpment
another
hour
or
so
and
lake
naivasha
comes
into
view
this
sheet
of
water
is
about
ten
miles
square
and
the
rim
of
a
submerged
crater
makes
an
odd
island
in
its
midst
its
brackish
waters
repel
the
inhabitants
but
afford
shelter
to
numberless
and
many
hippopotami
at
naivasha
there
is
the
government
stock
farm
one
may
see
in
their
various
flocks
the
native
sheep
the
english
the
etc
the
improvement
is
amazing
the
native
sheep
is
a
hairy
animal
looking
to
the
unpractised
eye
more
like
a
goat
than
a
sheep
crossed
with
sussex
or
australian
blood
his
descendant
is
transformed
into
a
woolled
beast
of
familiar
aspect
at
the
next
cross
the
progeny
is
almost
indistinguishable
from
the
english
in
appearance
but
better
adapted
to
the
african
sun
and
climate
it
is
the
same
with
cattle
in
the
first
generation
the
hump
of
the
african
ox
vanishes
in
the
second
he
emerges
a
respectable
british
shorthorn
the
object
of
this
farm
is
twofold
first
to
find
the
type
best
adapted
to
local
conditions
secondly
to
supply
the
settlers
and
the
natives
with
a
steadily
broadening
fountain
of
good
blood
by
which
their
flocks
and
herds
may
be
trebled
and
quadrupled
in
value
the
enthusiasm
and
zeal
of
those
in
charge
of
this
work
were
refreshing
at
present
however
their
operations
are
restricted
by
insufficient
funds
and
by
the
precautions
which
must
be
taken
against
east
coast
fever
the
first
of
these
impediments
may
be
removed
the
second
is
less
tractable
east
coast
fever
came
across
the
german
border
a
year
and
a
half
ago
and
since
then
in
spite
of
such
preventive
measures
as
our
scanty
means
allow
it
has
been
gradually
and
slowly
spreading
through
the
protectorate
a
diseased
cow
may
take
thirty
days
to
die
in
the
meantime
wherever
it
goes
the
swarming
ticks
are
infected
they
hold
their
poison
for
a
year
if
during
that
time
other
cattle
pass
over
the
ground
the
ticks
fasten
upon
them
and
inoculate
them
with
the
sickness
and
each
new
victim
wanders
off
to
spread
the
curse
to
new
ticks
who
cast
it
back
to
new
cattle
and
so
on
till
the
end
of
the
story
at
each
point
fresh
areas
of
ground
become
distempered
and
fresh
cows
begin
to
drop
off
one
by
one
leaving
their
evil
inheritance
to
the
ravening
insects

government

so
here
we
see
the
two
principles
of
nature
at
work
simultaneously
the
rams
and
bulls
spreading
their
healthy
fruitful
life
in
circles
through
the
land
the
infected
cattle
carrying
their
message
of
death
in
all
directions
every
point
that
either
attains
becomes
at
once
a
new
centre
of
vitality
or
dissolution
both
processes
march
deliberately
forward
to
limitless
multiplications
the
native
is
helpless
in
the
face
of
advancing
ruin
left
to
itself
the
evil
would
assuredly
devour
the
good
till
the
cattle
were
exterminated
and
the
sickness
starved
to
death
for
lack
of
prey
but
at
this
moment
the
white
biped
with
faculties
of
ratiocination
intervenes
from
the
department
of
agriculture
discovers
for
instance
that

may
be
purified

took
four
days
in
travelling
to

although
the
distance
can
be
covered
in

for
we
turned
aside
every
day
for
sport
or
business
while
our
train
waited
obligingly
in
a
siding
of
the
latter
indeed
there
was
no
lack
for
the
governor
and
the
heads
of
several
departments
were
in
the
train
and
we
laboured
faithfully
together
at
many
prickly
things
then
at
the
stations
came
farmers
surveyors
and
others
with
words
of
welcome
or
complaint
and
a
deputation
of

with
many
expressions
of
loyalty

and
the

of

but
elmenteita
was
all
holiday
lord
delamere
met
us
at
the
station
with
cape
carts
ponies
and
and
we
drove
off
in
search
of
pig
over
an
enormous
plain
thickly
peopled
with
antelope
and
gazelle
i
can
not
pretend
to
the
experience
of
both
countries
necessary
to
compare
the
merits
of
in
india
and
in
east
africa
in
respect
of
the
fighting
qualities
of
the
animal
nor
the
ground
over
which
he
is
pursued
but
i
should
think
the
most
accomplished
member
of
the
meerut
tent
club
would
admit
that
the
courage
and
ferocity
of
the
african
and
the
extreme
roughness
of
the
country
heaped
as
it
is
with
boulders
and
pitted
with
deep
holes
concealed
by
high
grass
make
in
east
africa
a
sport
which
would
well
deserve
his
serious
and
appreciative
attention
at
present
it
is
in
its
infancy
and
very
few
even
of
the
officers
of
the
african
rifles
can
boast
the
proficiency
of
the
indian
expert
but
everything
in
east
africa
is
at
its
first
page
and
besides
the
is
at
present
at
any
rate
regarded
as
dangerous
vermin
who
does
incredible
damage
to
native
plantations
and
whose
destruction
by
any
method
even
the
most
difficult
is
useful
as
well
as
exciting
our
first
pig
was
a
fine
fellow
who
galloped
off
with
his
tail
straight
up
in
the
air
and
his
tusks
gleaming
mischievously
and
afforded
a
run
of
nearly
three
miles
before
he
was
killed
the
risk
of
the
sport
consists
in
this
that
the
pig
can
not
be
overtaken
and
effectively
speared
except
by
a
horse
absolutely
at
full
gallop
the
ground
is
so
trappy
that
one
hardly
cares
to
take
one
eyes
off
it
for
a
moment
yet
during
at
least
a
hundred
yards
at
a
time
the
whole
attention
of
the
rider
must
be
riveted
on
the
pig
within
a
few
yards
of
whom
he
is
riding
and
who
may
be
expected
to
charge
at
any
second
a
fall
at
such
a
climax
is
necessarily
very
dangerous
as
the
would
certainly
attack
the
unhorsed
cavalier
yet
no
one
can
avoid
the
chance
i
do
not
know
whether
will
shudder
but
i
should
certainly
recommend
the
intending
hunter
in
east
africa
to
strap
a
revolver
on
his
thigh
in
case
of
accidents
you
do
not
want
it
often
as
the
american
observed
but
when
you
do
you
want
it
badly
we
passed
a
jolly
morning
riding
after
these
brutes
and
shooting
a
few
and
or
grants
and
tommies
as
they
are
familiarly
called
and
in
looking
for
eland
in
the
intervals
at
the
end
of
lake
elmenteita
a
beautiful
sheet
of
water
unhappily
brackish
a
feast
had
been
prepared
to
which
a
number
of
gentlemen
from
lord
delamere
estates
and
the
surrounding
farms
had
been
bidden
a
long
array
of
flocks
and
herds
was
marshalled
on
both
sides
of
the
track
in
due
order
pure
through
these
insignia
of
patriarchal
wealth
which
would
have
excited
the
keenest
interest
in
any
traveller
less
hungry
and
more
instructed
in
such
matters
than
i
we
made
our
way
to
an
excellent
luncheon
which
be
sure
was
not
unaccompanied
by
the
usual
discussion
on
east
african
politics
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
we
started
back
to
the
train
which
lay
eight
miles
off
in
a
siding
on
the
way
we
fell
in
with
a
most
fierce
and
monstrous
pig
who
led
us
a
nice
dance
through
bush
and
grass
and
boulder
as
he
emerged
into
a
patch
of
comparatively
smooth
open
ground
i
made
up
my
mind
to
spear
him
urged
my
pony
to
her
top
speed
and
was
just
considering
how
best
to
do
the
deed
when
without
the
slightest
provocation
or
at
any
rate
before
he
had
been
even
pricked
the
pig
turned
sharp
round
and
sprang
at
me
as
if
he
were
a
leopard
luckily
my
spear
got
in
the
way
and
with
a
solid
jar
which
made
my
arm
stiff
for
a
week
drove
deep
into
his
head
and
neck
before
it
broke
so
that
he
was
glad
to
sheer
off
with
eighteen
inches
of
it
sticking
in
him
and
after
a
dash
at
my
companion
he
took
refuge
in
a
deep
hole
from
which
no
inducements
or
insults
could
draw
him
later
we
rode
and
killed
another
pig
and
chased
a
fourth
unsuccessfully
and
it
was
nearly
dark
before
the
railway
was
reached
as
i
was
getting
into
my
carriage
they
calmly
told
me
that
had
walked
across
the
line
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
a
settler
who
had
been
to
lunch
at
elmenteita
was
loading
a
revolver
before
starting
on
his
homeward
ride
to
nakuru
and
as
i
gave
him
some
cartridges
i
reflected
that
whatever
may
be
the
shortcomings
of
east
africa
the
absence
of
an
interesting
and
varied
fauna
is
certainly
not
among
them
next
day
our
train
is
climbing
through
dense
and
beautiful
forests
to
the
summit
of
the
mau
escarpment
admiration
of
the
wealth
and
splendour
of
the
leafy
kingdom
is
mingled
with
something
very
like
awe
at
its
aggressive
fertility
the
great
trees
overhang
the
line
the
creepers
trail
down
the
cuttings
robing
the
red
soil
with
cloaks
of
flowers
and
foliage
the
embankments
are
already
covered
every
clearing
is
densely
overgrown
with
sinuous
plants
but
for
the
ceaseless
care
with
which
the
whole
line
is
scraped
and
weeded
it
would
soon
become
impassable
as
it
is
the
long
fingers
of
the
encroaching
forest
are
everywhere
stretching
out
enviously
towards
the
bright
metals
neglect
the
uganda
railway
for
a
year
and
it
would
take
an
expedition
to
discover
where
it
had
run
at
nyoro
station
nearly
nine
hundred
natives
were
at
work
cutting
timber
for
the
railway
which
is
entirely
dependent
on
wood
fuel
the
contractor
in
charge
a
young
english
gentleman
who
was
described
to
me
as
being
a
model
employer
of
native
labour
in
government
contracts
had
taken
the
trouble
to
cut
a
path
through
the
forest
across
a
loop
of
the
line
in
order
that
i
might
see
what
it
was
like
inside
through
this
leafy
tunnel
about
a
mile
and
a
half
long
we
all
accordingly
dived
there
was
nothing
sinister
in
the
aspect
of
this
forest
for
all
its
density
and
confusion
the
great
giants
towered
up
magnificently
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
then
came
the
ordinary
forest
trees
much
more
thickly
clustered
below
this
again
was
a
layer
of
scrub
and
bushes
and
under
around
and
among
the
whole
flowed
a
vast
sea
of
creeper
through
all
this
veil
the
sunlight
struggled
down
every
twenty
yards
or
so
in
gleaming
chequers
of
green
and
gold
on
the
way
the
method
of
is
explained
so
far
as
the
labourer
is
concerned
it
is
an
elaborate
system
of
very
accurately
and
fairly
adjusted
and
as
is
so
often
the
case
where
the
white
employer
takes
personal
care
of
his
men
there
appeared
to
be
no
difficulty
in
finding
any
number
of
natives
but
they
are
a
plaguey
company
few
will
stay
for
more
than
a
month
or
two
however
satisfied
they
may
be
with
their
work
and
its
rewards
and
just
as
they
begin
to
get
skilful
off
they
go
to
their
villages
to
cultivate
their
gardens
and
their
families
promising
to
come
back
another
year
or
after
the
harvest
or
at
some
other
remote
and
indefinite
date
and
meanwhile
the
railway
must
have
its
fuel
every
day
and
day
after
day
with
the
remorseless
monotony
of
the
industrial
machine
but
what
a
way
to
cut
fuel
a
floating
population
of
clumsy
barbarians
pecking
at
the
trees
with
native
choppers
more
like
a
toy
hoe
than
an
axe
and
carrying
their
loads
when
completed
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
their
heads
to
the
while
the
forest
laughs
at
the
feebleness
of
man
i
made
a
calculation
each
of
the
nine
hundred
natives
employed
costs
on
the
whole
six
pounds
a
year
the
price
of
a
steam
plant
with
a
mile
of
tram
complete
is
about
five
hundred
pounds
the
interest
and
sinking
fund
on
this
capital
outlay
represent
the
wages
of
four
natives
to
which
must
be
added
the
salary
of
a
competent
white
engineer
equal
to
the
wage
of
forty
natives
and
the
working
expenses
and
depreciation
roughly
estimated
at
the
wage
of
twenty
natives
more
in
all
the
wage
of
natives
such
a
plant
able
to
cut
trees
six
feet
in
diameter
through
in
four
or
five
minutes
to
cut
timber
as
well
as
fuel
to
saw
it
into
the
proper
lengths
for
every
purpose
with
the
utmost
rapidity
and
to
transport
it
by
whole
when
sawn
to
the
railway
siding
would
accomplish
a
week
work
of
the
natives
it
replaced
in
a
single
day
and
effect
a
sevenfold
multiplication
of
power
it
is
no
good
trying
to
lay

of

africa
with
naked
fingers
civilization
must
be
armed
with

she
is
to
subdue

her
authority

porters
tireless

not

cheap
power
not
cheap

steam
and
skill
not
sweat
and
fumbling
there
lies
the
only
way
to
tame
the
jungle
more
jungles
than
one
on
this
we
talked
or
at
least
i
talked
while
we
scrambled
across
the
stumps
of
fallen
trees
or
waded
in
an
emerald
twilight
from
one
sunbeam
to
another
across
the
creeper
flood
it
is
of
vital
importance
that
these
forests
should
not
be
laid
waste
by
reckless
and
improvident
hands
it
is
not
less
important
that
the
uganda
railway
should
have
cheap
fuel
for
a
long
time
fuel
alone
was
the
object
but
now
that
an
elaborate
forestry
department
has
been
established
on
the
most
scientific
lines
there
is
a
danger
that
forestry
will
be
the
only
object
and
the
cost
of
fuel
so
raised
by
regulations
admirable
in
themselves
that
the
economy
of
the
uganda
railway
may
be
impaired
and
let
us
never
forget
that
the
uganda
railway
is
the
of
the
whole
concern
what
is
needed
here
as
elsewhere
is
a
harmonious
compromise
between
opposite
and
conflicting
interests
that
is
all
presently
our
guide
began
to
tell
us
of
the
strange
creatures
who
live
in
the
forest
and
are
sometimes
seen
quite
close
by
the
very
rare
antelope
enormous
buffaloes
and
astonishing
birds
and
butterflies
beyond
imagination
he
had
managed
to
make
friends
with
the
wandorobo
a
tribe
of
natives
who
live
plunged
in
these
impenetrable
shades
who
are
so
shy
that
if
once
a
stranger
does
but
set
eye
upon
their
village
forthwith
they
abandon
it
yet
who
are
at
the
same
time
so
teased
by
curiosity
that
they
can
not
resist
peeping
peeping
ever
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
until
one
day
commercial
relations
are
established
on
the
basis
of
sugar
for
skins
i
was
just
becoming
interested
in
these
when
we
broke
into
the
hot
blaze
of
the
noonday
sun
beating
down
on
the
polished
railway
track
and
had
to
climb
up
on
to
our
cowcatcher
in
order
to
hurry
on
to
a
real
steam
ten
miles
farther
up
the
line
as
the
journey
advances
the
train
mounts
steadily
higher
and
the
aspect
of
the
country
changes
the
forest
which
has
hitherto
lapped
the
line
closely
on
every
side
now
makes
fair
division
with
rolling
hills
of
grass
and
there
is
this
extraordinary
feature
about
it
where
the
forest
areas
end
they
end
abruptly
there
is
no
ragged
belt
of
trees
less
thickly
grown
no
transition
smooth
slopes
of
grass
run
up
to
the
very
edge
of
virgin
forest
just
as
in
england
the
meadow
runs
to
the
edge
of
the
covert
the
effect
is
to
make
the
landscape
surprisingly
homelike
it
is
like
travelling
through
a
series
of
gigantic
parks
where
the
hand
of
man
has
for
hundreds
of
years
decided
exactly
where
trees
shall
grow
and
where
they
shall

burst
upon

i
was
astonished
by
its

is
based
not
upon
mere
ignorance

reasoned
policy
they
have
a
very
strong
prejudice
against
the
wearing
of

they
declare
lead

can
attire

the

of

arises
from
the
fact

lose
much

are

immune

influences
of
all
kinds
constitute
what

used
to
call
the
motor
muscle
of
imperial
authority
i
have
always
admired
the
sikh
in
india
both
in
his
cantonments
and
in
the
field
but
somehow
his
graceful
military
figure
and
grave
countenance
under
the
turban
as
he
stands
erect
beside
his
rifle
on
guard
over
british
interests
six
thousand
miles
from

impresses
the
eye
and

added

considerations
of
expense
or
the
desire
to
obtain
a
complete
homogeneity
in
the
military
forces
of
the
protectorate
should
lead
to
the
disbandment
or
withdrawal
of
these
two
companies
those
who
take
the
decision
will
have
incurred
a
responsibility
which
few
would
care
to
share
with
them
so
far
as
human
force
is
concerned
the
british
power
in
these
regions
is
at
present
beyond
challenge
no
man
can
withstand
it
but
a
new
opponent
has
appeared
and
will
not
be
denied
uganda
is
defended
by
its
insects
it
would
even
seem
that
the
arrival
of
the
white
man
and
the
increased
movement
and
activity
which
his
presence
has
engendered
have
awakened
these
formidable
atoms
to
a
realization
of
their
powers
of
evil
the
dreaded
tick
has
begun
to
infest
the
roads
like
a
tiny
footpad
and
scarcely
any
precautions
avail
with
certainty
against
him
this
tick
is
a
dirty
creature
the
size
and
shape
of
a
small
squashed
pea
when
he
bites
an
infected
person
he
does
not
contract
the
spirillum
fever
himself
nor
does
he
transmit
it
directly
to
other
persons
by
a
peculiarly
malevolent
provision
of
nature
this
power
is
exercised
not
by
him
but
by
his
descendants
who
are
numbered
in
hundreds
so
the
poison
spreads
in
an
incalculable
progression
although
this
fever
is
not
fatal
it
is
exceptionally
painful
in
its
course
and
distressing
in
its
consequences
there
are
five
or
six
separate
and
successive
attacks
of
fever
in
which
the
temperature
of
the
victim
may
rise
even
to
degrees
and
afterwards
the
eyes
and
hearing
are
temporarily
affected
by
a
kind
of
facial
paralysis
road
after
road
has
been
declared
infected
by
this
scourge
and
officer
after
officer
struck
down
as
he
moves
on
duty
from
place
to
place
the
only
sure
preventive
seems
to
be
the
destruction
of
all
old
and
and
the
erection
along
the
roads
of
a
regular
system
of
properly
maintained
and
disinfected
in
which
the
traveller
may
take
refuge
from
the
lurking
peril
and
this
will
have
to
be
done
but
a
far
more
terrible
shadow
darkens
the
uganda
protectorate
in
july
a
doctor
of
the
church
missionary
society
hospital
at
kampala
noticed
eight
cases
of
a
mysterious
disease
six
months
later
he
reported
that
over
two
hundred
natives
had
died
of
it
in
the
island
of
buvuma
and
that
thousands
appeared
to
be
infected
the
pestilence
swiftly
spread
through
all
the
districts
of
the
lake
shore
and
the
mortality
was
appalling
no
one
could
tell
where
it
had
come
from
or
what
it
was
caused
by
it
resisted
every
kind
of
treatment
and
appeared
to
be
universally
fatal
scientific
inquiries
of
various
kinds
were
immediately
set
on
foot
but
for
a
long
time
no
results
were
obtained
and
meanwhile
the
disease
ran
along
the
coasts
and
islands
of
the
great
lake
like
fire
in
a
high
wind
by
the
middle
of
the
reported
deaths
from
or
sleeping
sickness
as
it
has
come
to
be
called
numbered
over
thirty
thousand
it
was
still
spreading
rapidly
upon
all
sides
and
no
clue
whatever
to
its
treatment
or
prevention
had
been
obtained
it
seemed
certain
that
the
entire
population
of
the
districts
affected
was
doomed
on
april
colonel
bruce
whose
services
had
been
obtained
for
the
investigation
of
sleeping
sickness
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
royal
society
announced
that
he
considered
the
disease
to
be
due
to
a
kind
of
trypanosome
conveyed
from
one
person
to
another
by
the
bite
of
a
species
of
called
his
theory
was
strongly
supported
by
the
fact
that
the
disease
appeared
to
be
confined
to
the
localities
infested
by
the
fly
the
also
could
be
defined
with
precision
and
was
rarely
found
to
extend
more
than
a
mile
or
two
from
water
the
news
that
europeans
could
no
longer
consider
themselves
immune
from
the
infection
caused
as
might
be
imagined
much
consternation
in
the
white
community
nearly
everybody
had
been
bitten
by
tsetses
at
one
time
or
another
but
whether
by
this
particular
species
when
actually
infected
remained
in
suspense
moreover
abounded
in
such
numbers
on
all
parts
of
the
lake
shore
that
their
wholesale
destruction
seemed
quite
impossible
what
then
for
a
time
colonel
bruce
discovery
almost
paralyzed
all
preventive
and
restrictive
measures
the
scourge
fell
unchecked
by
the
end
of
the
reported
deaths
numbered
over
ninety
thousand
and
the
lake
shores
were
becoming
fast
depopulated
whole
villages
were
completely
exterminated
and
great
tracts
in
usoga
which
had
formerly
been
famed
for
their
high
state
of
cultivation
relapsed
into
forests
the
weakness
of
the
victims
and
the
terror
or
apathy
of
the
survivors
permitted
a
sudden
increase
in
the
number
of
leopards
and
these
fierce
animals
preyed
with
daring
and
impunity
upon
the
living
the
dying
and
the
dead
further
investigations
which
were
anxiously
pushed
on
in
many
directions
revealed
the
existence
of
the

widespread
areas

these
swarming
emissaries
of
death
were
found
to
be
awaiting
their
message
all
that
was
needed
to
arm
them
with
their
fatal
power
was
the
arrival
of
some
person
infected
with
the
microbe
the
albert
shores
and
several
parts
of
the
upper
nile

became

any
decrease
in

mortality
in
any
district
up
to
the
present
time
is
due
not
to
any
diminution
in
the
virulence
of
the
disease
but
simply
to
the
reduction
of
possible
victims
owing
to

might

writes
sir
hesketh
bell
the
governor
of
uganda
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
much
valuable
information
on
this
subject
that
even
though
the
negroes
showed
inability
to
grasp
the
theory
of
the
transmission
of
disease
by
the
agency
of
insects
the
undeniable
deadliness
of
the
countries
bordering
on
the
lake
shore
would
have
induced
them
to
flee
from
the
stricken
land
and
to
have
sought
in
the
healthier
districts
inland
a
refuge
from
the
pestilence
that
was
slaying
them
by
thousands
an
extraordinary
fatalism
however
seems
to
have
paralyzed
the
natives
and
while
deploring
the
sadness
of
their
fate
they
appear
to
have
accepted
death
almost
with
apathy
the
police
of
science
although
arrived
late
on
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
were
now
following
many
converging
clues
therapeutic
investigation
into
the
treatment
and
origin
of
the
disease
entomological
examination
of
the
resorts
habits
dangers
and
of
the
fly
and
thirdly
administrative
measures
of
drastic
authority
are
now
being
driven
sternly
forward
knowledge
has
accumulated
fighting
the
sleeping
sickness
is
like
laying
a
vampire
to
make
the
spell
work
five
separate
conditions
must
be
present
water
bushes
trees
the
and
one
infected
person
remove
any
one
of
these
and
the
curse
is
lifted
but
let
them
all
be
conjoined
and
the
sure
destruction
of
every
human
being
in
the
district
is
only
a
matter
of
time
the
government
of
uganda
is
now
pursuing
a
policy
based
on
the
appreciation
of
these
facts
wherever
it
is
necessary
to
come
to
the
lake
shores
as
at
entebbe
munyonyo
ripon
falls
fajao
the
is
banished
or
eliminated
by
cutting
down
the
trees
clearing
away
the
bush
and
planting
in
its
place
the
vigorous
grass
which
once
firmly
established
holds
its
own
against
invading
vegetation
wherever
it
is
not
possible
to
clear
the
shores
of
they
must
be
cleared
of
inhabitants
and
the
extraordinary
operation
of
moving
entire
populations
from
their
old
homes
to
new
places
often
against
their
will
has
been
actually
accomplished
within
the
last
year
by
a
combined
effort
of
these
three
tremendous
forces
of
government
which
regulate
from
such
different
points
of
view
the
lives
and
liberties
of
the
baganda
it
does
not
follow
that
the
lake
shores
will
have
to
be
abandoned
for
ever
in
a
very
short
time
some
say
two
days
some
eleven
hours
the
infected
tsetse
is
free
from
poison
and
can
no
longer
communicate
it
and
once
the
disease
has
been
eradicated
from
the
population
healthy
people
might
return
and
be
bitten
with
impunity
nor
on
the
other
hand
can
we
hope
unless
some
cure
capable
of
being
applied
on
a
large
scale
can
be
perfected
that
the
mortality
in
the
immediate
future
will
sensibly
diminish
for
there
are
many
thousands
of
persons
still
affected
and
for
these
segregation
nursing
and
compassion
comprise
the
present
resources
of
civilization
one
thing
is
however
above
all
things
important
there
must
be
no
losing
heart
at
any
moment
the
researches
which
are
being
conducted
in
so
many
laboratories
and
in
which
professor
koch
has
taken
a
leading
part
may
produce
an
absolute
therapeutic
remedy
by
the
administrative
measures
now
vigorously
enforced
it
is
believed
that
the
fatal
contact
between
infected
persons
and
uninfected
flies
between
infected
flies
and
uninfected
persons
will
have
been
effectively
broken
we
can
not
fail

the

chapter
vi
kampala
two
days
after
i
had
arrived
at
entebbe
the
governor
took
me
over
to
kampala
the
distance
between
the
ancient
and
the
administrative
capital
is
about
miles
the
road
although
unmetalled
runs
over
such
firm
smooth
sandstone
almost
polished
by
the
rains
that
except
in
a
few
places
it
would
carry
a
well
and
a
bicycle
is
an
excellent
means
of
progression
the
uganda
government
which
are
now
running
well
and
regularly
had
not
then
however
arrived
and
the
usual
method
was
to
travel
by
rickshaw
mounted
in
this
light
carriage
drawn
by
one
man
between
the
shafts
and
pushed
by
three
more
from
behind
we
were
able
to
make
rather
more
than
six
miles
an
hour
in
very
comfortable
style
the
who
were
neatly
dressed
in
white
tunics
and
red
caps
were
relieved
every
eight
miles
they
have
their
own
way
of
doing
business
from
the
moment
when
the
travellers
are
seated
in
the
rickshaw
and
their
labour
begins
they
embark
upon
an
but
absolutely
interminable
antiphony
which
if
it
exhausts
their
breath
serves
undoubtedly
to
keep
their
spirits

say
the

again
and
so
on
over
and
over
again
for
a
very
long
time
all
these
chaunts
have
their
meanings
and
if
the
traveller
is
found
to
be
heavy
or
known
to
be
ignorant
of
the
language
he
would
not
always
be
complimented
by
a
correct
translation
the
phrase
i
have
quoted
means
iron
upon
wood
and
its
signification
is
that
the
iron
of
european
strength
and
skill
however
superior
yet
can
not
get
along
without
the
wood
of
native
labour
and
endurance
with
such
unexceptionable
sentiments
no
one
would
quarrel
yet
even
these
lose
their
flavour
by
repetition
and
after
half
an
hour
of
burrulum
and
huma
i
was
constrained
to
ask
the
singers
whether
they
could
not
possibly
manage
to
convey
us
in
silence
they
tried
their
best
but
i
could
see
they
were
unhappy
and
after
a
while
out
of
compassion
and
to
improve
the
pace
i
withdrew
the
ban
and
the
chorus
was
joyfully
resumed
in
a
new
and
more
elaborate
form

manners
of
the

at
kampala
if
you
wish
to
make
a
baganda
perfectly
happy
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
say
way
wally
which
means
a
sort
of
supremely
earnest
well
done
the
moment
this
talismanic
expression
has
left
your
lips
the
native
to
whom
it
is
addressed
will
probably
fall
on
his
knees
and
clasping
his
two
hands
together
will
sway
them
from
side
to
side
as
if
he
were
playing
a
concertina
while
all
the
time
his
face
beams
with
a
most
benignant
and
compulsive
smile
and
he
purrs
a
o
a
o
a
o
as
much
as
to
say
my
cup
of
joy
is
overflowing
it
is
not
in
accordance
with
our
ideas
that
man
should
kneel
to
man
and
one
feels
uncomfortable
to
see
it
done
yet
it
should
not
be
thought
that
the
action
as
performed
by
the
baganda
involves
or
implies
any
servility
it
is
their
good
manners
and
meant
to
be
no
more
nor
once
you
are
used
to
it
do
they
seem
to
lose
at
all
in
dignity
only
they
win
your
heart
the
road
from
entebbe
to
kampala
passes
through
delicious
country
along
its
whole
length
a
double
avenue
of
rubber
trees
has
just
been
planted
and
behind
these
on
each
side
are
broad
strips
of
cotton
plants
looking
beautiful
with
their
yellow
flowers
or
bolls
american
upland
cotton
grown
in
uganda
actually
commands
a
higher
price
in
the
manchester
market
than
when
it
is
grown
in
the
united
states
there
appears
to
be
practically
no
natural
difficulty
in
its
cultivation
throughout
the
larger
part
of
uganda
a
great
development
is
only
a
question
of
organization
and
money
but
i
have
forgotten
that
we
have
been
moving
swiftly
along
the
kampala
road
and
now
we
are
almost
in
sight
of
the
city
almost
but
not
quite
for
to
tell
the
truth
no
one
has
ever
seen
kampala
the
traveller
sees
the
government
buildings
and
residences
neat
and
prim
on
one
hill
he
sees
the
king
house
and
his
ministers
houses
on
another
upon
a
third
a
fourth
or
a
fifth
hill
he
may
discern
successively
the
protestant
cathedral
the
catholic
mission
and
the
white
father
monastery
but
kampala
the
home
of
sixty
thousand
persons
is
permanently
invisible
the
whole
town
is
buried
under
the
leaves
of
innumerable
banana
plantations
which
afford
shade
and
food
to
its
people
and
amid
which
their
huts
are
thickly
scattered
and
absolutely
concealed

we
were
still
three
miles
out
of
this
garden
city
when
the
native
reception
began
and
we
travelled
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
between
lines
of
baganda
all
mustered
by
their
chiefs
and
clapping
their
hands
in
sign
of
welcome
at
last
our
procession
of
rickshaws
reached
a
hillock
by
the
roadside
at
the
top
of
which
stood
a
pavilion
beautifully
constructed
of
stout
elephant
grass
like
thin
polished
canes
woven
together
with
curious
art
down
from
this
eminence
over
a
pathway
strewn
with
rushes
came
to
meet
us
the
king
and
his
notables
in
a
most
imposing
array
daudi
chewa
the
king
or
kabaka
of
uganda
is
a
graceful
little
boy
eleven
years
old
he
was
simply
dressed
in
a
flowing
black
robe
edged
with
gold
and
a
little
white
cap
around
him
were
the
council
of
regency
and
at
his
right
hand
stood
the
prime
minister
sir
apolo
kagwar
a
powerful
man
wearing
a
crimson
robe
on
which
shone
many
decorations
several
british
war
medals
and
the
order
of
michael
and
george
we
all
shook
hands
and
were
then
led
up
into
the
pavilion
where
we
took
our
seats
on
wicker
chairs
and
ate
sweet
jellies
while
we
conversed
the
king
who
is
being
most
carefully
educated
by
an
english
tutor
understands
and
speaks
english
quite
well
but
on
this
occasion
he
seemed
too
shy
to
say
much
more
than
yes
or
no
in
a
low
sweet
drawl
and
this
formal
interview
soon
came
to
an
end
the
afternoon
was
consumed
in
ceremony
for
the
commissioner
of
uganda
had
to
be
sworn
in
the
rank
of
governor
to
which
he
has
been
lately
raised
and
there
was
a
parade
of
troops
in
which
some
five
or
six
hundred
very
soldiers
took
part
headed
by
the
kampala
company
of
sikhs
it
was
not
until
the
shadows
began
to
lengthen
that
we
visited
the
kabaka
on
the
royal
hill
he
received
us
in
his
parliament
house
in
this
large
and
grass
building
about
seventy
chiefs
and
baganda
notables
were
assembled
the
little
kabaka
sat
on
his
throne
and
his
subjects
grouped
themselves
around
and
before
him
we
were
given
seats
at
his
side
and
the
prime
minister
explained
that
the
baganda
would
show
us
the
ceremony
of
swearing
a
chief
one
of
the
most
portly
and
dignified
of
the
councillors
thereupon
advanced
into
the
centre
of
the
room
threw
himself
face
downward
on
the
ground
and
poured
out
a
torrent
of
asseverations
of
loyalty
after
a
few
minutes
he
rose
and
began
brandishing
his
spears
chaunting
his
oath
all
the
while
until
he
had
created
an
extraordinary
appearance
of
passion
finally
he
rushed
from
the
building
to
go
and
slay
the
king
enemies
outside
it
was
not
until
he
returned
a
moment
later
calm
sedate
and
respectable
that
i
realized
from
the
merry
smile
on
his
face
and
from
the
mirth
of
the
company
that
he
was
only
pretending
and
that
the
ceremony
was
merely
a
representation
given
to
interest
us

the

between
jinja
and

the
incident
is
remarkable
because
it
illustrates
the
rapidity
with
which
the
baganda
people
are
leaving
their
past
behind
them
already
they
laugh
at
their
old
selves
ceremonies
which
twenty
years
ago
had
a
solemn
and
awful
significance
are
reproduced
by
this
reflective
people
in
much
the
same
spirit
as
the
citizens
of
coventry
revive
the
progress
of
lady
godiva
the
same
thing
happened
at
the
the
next
day
two
or
three
thousand
men
naked
and
painted
for
war
rushed
frantically
to
and
fro
to
the
beating
of
drums
and
barbaric
music
with
every
sign
of
earnestness
and
even
frenzy
yet
a
few
minutes
later
they
were
laughing
sheepishly
at
one
another
and
bowing
to
us
like
actors
before
the
curtain
and
the
prime
minister
was
making
a
speech
to
explain
that
this
was
meant
to
be
a
pageant
of
the
bad
old
times
reproduced
for
our
benefit
indeed
so
unaccustomed
to
carry
arms
had
the
warriors
become
that
not
one
in
ten
could
find
a
spear
to
arm
himself
with
and
they
had
to
come
with
sticks
and
other
even
a
comic
element
was
provided
in
the
shape
of
a
warrior
painted
all
over
in
a
ridiculous
manner
and
held
by
two
others
with
a
rope
tied
round
his
middle
this
we
were
told
was
the
bravest
man
in
the
army
who
had
to
be
restrained
lest
he
should
rush
into
battle
too
soon
it
is
not
easy
to
convey
the
air
of
honest
fun
and
good
humour
which
pervaded
these
curious
performances
or
to
measure
the
intellectual
progress
which
the
attitude
of
the
baganda
towards
them
implied

at

the
kabaka
gave
us
tea
in
his
house
it
is
a
comfortable
european
building
quite
small
and
modest
but
nicely
furnished
and
adorned
with
familiar
english
prints
and
portraits
of
queen
victoria
and
king
edward
gradually
he
got
the
better
of
his
shyness
and
told
me
that
he
liked
football
more
than
anything
else
and
that
his
mathematical
studies
had
advanced
as
far
as
initials
which
never
fail
to
stir
disagreeable
memories
in
my
mind
he
can
write
a
very
good
letter
in
english
rides
well
on
a
nice
pony
and
will
probably
become
a
and
accomplished
man
altogether
it
is
a
very
pleasing
spectacle
to
find
in
the
heart
of
africa
and
amid
so
much
barbarism
squalour
and
violence
this
island
of
gentle
manners
and
peaceful
civilization
the
next
day
was
one
unending
pilgrimage
i
have
described
how
kampala
lies
under
the
leaves
of
the
plantain
groves
about
the
slopes
of
many
hills
each
hill
has
its
special
occupants
and
purpose
each
of
the
different
christian
missions
has
a
hill
to
itself
and
in
the
bad
old
days
a
maxim
gun
was
not
thought
at
all
an
inappropriate
aid
to
christian
endeavour
it
would
however
be
very
unfair
to
charge
the
missionaries
with
having
created
the
feuds
and
struggles
which
convulsed
uganda
twelve
years
ago
the
accident
that
the
line
of
cleavage
between
french
and
british
influence
was
also
the
line
of
cleavage
between
catholic
and
protestant
converts
imparted
a
religious
complexion
to
what
was
in
reality
a
fierce
political
dispute
these
troubles
are
now
definitely
at
an
end
the
arrival
upon
the
scene
of
an
english
catholic
mission
has
prevented
national
rivalries
and
religious
differences
from
mutually
embittering
one
another
the
erection
of
a
stable
government
and
the
removal
of
all
doubts
about
the
future
of
uganda
have
led
to
an
entire
abatement
of
strife
among
devoted
men
engaged
in
a
noble
work
not
only
is
there
peace
among
the
different
christian
missions
themselves
but
the
government
of
uganda
so
far
from
watching
missionary
enterprise
with
sour
disfavour
is
thoroughly
alive
to
the
inestimable
services
which
have
been
and
are
daily
being
rendered
by
the
missions
to
the
native
population
and
excellent
relations
prevail

in

i
climbed
one
hill
after
another
and
endeavoured
to
make
myself
acquainted
with
the
details
of
mission
work
in
kampala
it
comprises
every
form
of
moral
and
social
activity
apart
from
their
spiritual
work
which
needs
no
advocacy
here
the
missionaries
have
undertaken
and
are
now
maintaining
the
whole
educational
system
of
the
country
they
have
built
many
excellent
schools
and
thousands
of
young
baganda
are
being
taught
to
read
and
write
in
their
own
language
the
whole
country
is
dotted
with
subsidiary
mission
stations
each
one
a
centre
of
philanthropic
and
christian
effort
there
are
good
hospitals
with
skilful
doctors
and
nurses

charity

connection
with
all
the
missions
the
largest
of
these
belonging
to
the

society
is
a
model
of
what
a
tropical
hospital
for
natives
ought
to
be
technical
education
is
now
being
added
to
these
services
and
in
this
it
is
to
be
hoped
the
government
will
be
able
to
cooperate
i
do
not
know
of
any
other
part
of
the
world
where
missionary
influence
and
enterprise
have
been
so
beneficently
exerted
or
where
more
valuable
results
have
been
achieved
on
namirembe
hill
where
the
church
missionary
society
have
their
a
really
fine
cathedral
with
three
tall
quaint
thatched
spires
has
been
built
out
of
very
primitive
materials
and
this
is
almost
the
only
building
in
uganda
which
offers
the
slightest
attempt
at
architectural
display
under
the
shadow
of
this
i
found
myself
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
november
engaged
in
opening
a
high
school
for
scholars
who
are
more
advanced
than
can
be
instructed
in
the
existing
establishments
a
large
and
audience
native
and
european
filled
a
room
the
scholars
crowded
together
in
a
solid
mass
of
youths
upon
the
floor
the
kabaka
and
sir
apolo
kagwar
who
has
himself
five
sons
at
the
school
were
upon
the
platform
the
governor
presided
the
bishop
made
a
speech
the
schoolboys
sang
english
songs
and
hymns
in
very
good
tune
and
rhythm
it
was
astonishing
to
look
at
the
map
of
the
british
empire
hanging
on
the
wall
and
to
realize
that
all
this
was
taking
place
near
the
corner
of
the
victoria
nyanza
illustration
interior
of
namirembe
cathedral
it
is
eight
miles
from
kampala
to
munyonyo
its
present
port
on
the
lake
and
this
distance
we
covered
in
rickshaws
over
a
shocking
road
munyonyo
is
itself
little
more
than
a
jetty
and
a
few
sheds
but
it
affords
a
very
good
example
of
the
salutary
effects
of
cutting
down
the
bush
and
forest
mosquitoes
and
tsetses
have
been
absolutely
banished
from
the
cleared
area
and
a
place
which
a
year
ago
was
a
is
now
perfectly
safe
and
healthy
plans
are
now
on
foot
to
make
a
new
port
a
little
farther
along
the
coast
at
a
point
only
five
miles
away
from
kampala
and
when
this
has
been
connected
with
the
capital
as
it
must
be
by
a
line
of
tramway
there
is
every
reason
to
expect
a
substantial
and
growing
trade
the
william
a
venerable
vessel
of
the
uganda
marine
awaited
our
party
and
we
steamed
off
on
the
smooth
waters
of
the
lake
through
an
archipelago
of
beautiful
islands
each
one
more
inviting
than
the
other
and
all
depopulated
by
sleeping
sickness
all
day
long
we
voyaged
in
these
sheltered
waters
and
in
the
evening
the
lights
of
jinja
guided
us
to
our
destination
one
can
not
help
admiring
the
luck
which
led
speke
to
his
thrilling
discovery
of
the
source
of
the
nile
there
are
five
hundred
gulfs
and
inlets
on
the
northern
shore
of
lake
victoria
and
nothing
distinguishes
this
one
from
the
rest
no
current
is
perceptible
to
the
ordinary
mariner
until
within
a
few
miles
of
the
rapids
and
although
the
presumption
that
so
vast
a
body
of
fresh
water
would
have
an
overflow
somewhere
had
behind
it
a
backing
of
strong
probability
the
explorer
might
have
searched
for
a
year
without
finding
the
spot
instead
of
which
he
drifted
and
paddled
gently
along
until
all
of
a
sudden
the
murmur
of
a
distant
cataract
and
the
slight
acceleration
in
the
pace
of
his
canoe
drew
him
to
the
birthplace
of
the
most
wonderful
river
in
the
world
it
was
dark
when
we
landed
at
jinja
and
i
could
not
properly
see
the
preparations
made
for
our
reception
by
the
local
chiefs
and
the
indian
traders
of
whom
there
was
a
considerable
crowd
the
darkness
otherwise
a
cause
of
disappointment
afforded
the
opportunity
for
just
the
sort
of
brave
act
one
so
often
finds
a
british
officer
ready
to
do
as
the
baggage
was
being
landed
from
the
steamer
on
to
the
jetty
a
poor
coolie
slipped
under
his
load
and
in
an
instant
was
engulfed
in
the
deep
black
waters
below
whereupon
as
a
matter
of
course
a
young
civilian
in
the
political
department
jumped
in
after
him
in
the
darkness
and
among
the
crocodiles
and
fished
him
out
safe
and
sound
an
act
of
admirable
behaviour
which
has
since
received
the
recognition
of
the
royal
humane
society
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
in
all
parts
of
africa
so
high
a
standard
of
honour
and
respect
for
the
life
of
the
humble
native
would
prevail
jinja
is
destined
to
become
a
very
important
place
in
the
future
economy
of
central
africa
situated
at
the
point
where
the
nile
flows
out
of
the
great
lake
it
is
at
once
on
the
easiest
line
of
water
communication
with
lake
albert
and
the
soudan
and
also
where
great
is
available
in
years
to
come
the
shores
of
this
splendid
bay
may
be
crowned
with
long
rows
of
comfortable
tropical
villas
and
imposing
offices
and
the
gorge
of
the
nile
crowded
with
factories
and
warehouses
there
is
power
enough
to
gin
all
the
cotton
and
saw
all
the
wood
in
uganda
and
it
is
here
that
one
of
the
principal
emporia
of
tropical
produce
will
certainly
be
created
in
these
circumstances
it
is
a
pity
to
handicap
the
town
with
an
outlandish
name
it
would
be
much
better
to
call
it
ripon
falls
after
the
beautiful
cascades
which
lie
beneath
it
and
from
whose
force
its
future
prosperity
will
be
derived
the
ripon
falls
are
for
their
own
sake

worth
a
visit

of

river
rushes
down
a
stairway
of
rock
from
fifteen
to
twenty
feet
deep
in
smooth
swirling
slopes
of

it
would
be
perfectly
easy
to
harness
the
whole
river

let
the

its
long
and
beneficent
journey
to
the

nowhere

so

held
up
by
so
little
masonry
two

three
short

and

now
running
to

but
all
within
the
reach
of
modern
science
the
problem
of
uganda
rises
in
a
new
form
on
the
mind
all
this
belongs
to
the
state
ought
it
ever
to
be
surrendered
to
private
persons
how
long
on
the
other
hand
is
a
government
if
not
prepared
to
act
itself
entitled
to
bar
the
way
to
others
this
question
is
raised
in
a
multitude
of
diverse
forms
in
almost
all
the
great
dependencies
of
the
crown
but
in
uganda
the
arguments
for
the
state
ownership
and
employment
of
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
seem
to
present
themselves
in
their
strongest
and
most
formidable
array
uganda
is
a
native
state
it
must
not
be
compared
with
any
of
those
colonies
where
there
is
a
white
population
already
established
nor
again
with
those
inhabited
by
tribes
of
nomadic
barbarians
it
finds
its
counterparts
among
the
great
native
states
of
india
where
imperial
authority
is
exercised
in
the
name
and
often
through
the
agency
of
a
native
prince
and
his
own
officers
this
combination
of
the
external
brain
and
the
native
hand
results
in
a
form
of
government
often
highly
acceptable
to
the
general
body
of
the
inhabitants
who
are
confronted
with
no
sudden
or
arbitrary
changes
in
the
appearances
of
things
but
it
involves
all
the
administration
of
affairs
in
a
degree
of
complexity
and
delicacy
which
is
absent
from
simpler
and
cruder
systems
in
such
circumstances
there
can
not
be
much
opening
for
the
push
and
drive
of
ordinary
commercial
enterprise
the
hustling
business
man
admirably
suited
to
the
rough
and
tumble
of
competitive
production
in
europe
or
america
becomes
an
incongruous
and
even
a
dangerous
figure
when
introduced
into
the
smooth
and
leisurely
development
of
a
native
state
the
baganda
will
not
be
benefited
either
morally
or
materially
by
contact
with
modern
or
modern
when
a
man
is
working
only
for
the
profits
of
his
company
and
is
judged
by
the
financial
results
alone
he
does
not
often
under
the
sun
of
central
africa
acquire
the
best
method
of
dealing
with
natives
and
all
sorts
of
difficulties
and
troubles
will
follow
any
sudden
incursion
of
business
enterprise
into
the
forests
and
gardens
of
uganda
and
even
if
the
country
is
more
rapidly
developed
by
these
agencies
the
profits
will
not
go
to
the
government
and
people
of
uganda
to
be
used
in
fostering
new
industries
but
to
divers
persons
across
the
sea
who
have
no
concern
other
than
purely
commercial
in
its
fortunes
this
is
not
to
advocate
the
arbitrary
exclusion
of
private
capital
and
enterprise
from
uganda
carefully
directed
and
narrowly
controlled
opportunities
for
their
activities
will
no
doubt
occur
but
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
should
as
far
as
possible
be
developed
by
the
government
itself
even
though
that
may
involve
the
assumption
of
many
new
functions
indeed
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
country
where
the
conditions
were
more
favourable
than
in
uganda
to
a
practical
experiment
in
state
socialism
the
land
is
rich
the
people
pacific
and
industrious
there
are
no
great
differences
between
class
and
class
one
staple
article
of
food
meets
the
needs
of
the
whole
population
and
produces
itself
almost
without
the
aid
of
man
there
are
no
european
vested
interests
to
block
the
way
nowhere
are
the
powers
of
the
government
to
regulate
and
direct
the
activities
of
the
people
more
overwhelming
or
more
comprehensive
the
superiority
of
knowledge
in
the
rulers
is
commanding
their
control
upon
the
natives
is
exerted
through
almost
every
channel
and
besides
the
secular
authorities
native
and
imperial
there
is
the
spiritual
and
educative
influence
of
the
missionaries
to
infuse
human
sympathy
and
moral
earnestness
into
the
regular
machinery
of
state
the
first
and
perhaps
the
greatest
difficulty
which
confronts
the
european
socialist
is
the
choosing
of
governors
to
whom
the
positively
awful
powers
indispensable
to
a
communistic
society
are
to
be
entrusted
if
a
race
of
beings
could
be
obtained
when
and
as
required
from
a
neighbouring
planet
whose
practical
superiority
in
virtue
science
wisdom
and
strength
was
so
manifest
as
to
be
universally
acclaimed
this
difficulty
would
disappear
and
we
might
with
composure
await
the
decision
of
popular
elections
with
all
their
defects
and
advantages
but
in
the
absence
of
this
dispensation
the
problem
of
how
rulers
are
to
be
selected
and
how
having
been
selected
they
are
to
be
controlled
or
changed
remains
the
first
question
of
politics
even
in
days
when
the
functions
of
government
are
in
general
restricted
to
the
modest
limits
of
in
uganda
however
this
difficulty
does
not
exist
a
class
of
rulers
is
provided
by
an
outside
power
as
remote
from
and
in
all
that
constitutes
fitness
to
direct
as
superior
to
the
baganda
as
wells
martians
would
have
been
to
us
the
british
administration
is
in
its
absolutely
disinterested
the
officials
draw
their
salaries
and
that
is
all
they
have
no
end
to
serve
except
the
improvement
of
the
country
and
the
contentment
of
its
people
by
that
test
and
that
test
alone
are
they
judged
in
no
other
way
can
they
win
approbation
or
fame
they
are
furthermore
controlled
in
the
exercise
of
their
functions
by
a
superior
authority
specially
instructed
in
this
class
of
administration
and
itself
answerable
to
a
parliament
elected
on
a
democratic
franchise
at
no
point
in
the
whole
chain
of
command
is
there
any
room
for
corruption
usurpation
or
gross
inefficiency
it
is
clear
that
larger
powers
could
be
entrusted
to
the
state
in
regard
to
the
labour
of
its
citizens
than
would
ever
be
accorded
to
private
employers
the
subjects
of
every
european
power
have
accepted
the
obligation
of
military
service
to
defend
their
respective
countries
from
external
attack
the
baganda
relieved
from
this
harsh
obsession
have
no
higher
duty
than
to
cultivate
and
develop
the
beautiful
land
they
live
in
and
if
it
were
desired
to
organize
scientifically
upon
a
humane
and
honourable
basis
the
industry
of
an
entire
population
and
to
apply
the
whole
fruits
of
their
labour
to
their
own
enrichment
and
elevation
no
better
conditions
are
likely
to
be
discovered
than
those
which
now
exist
in
uganda
it
might
at
any
rate
be
worth
while
to
make
such
an
experiment
if
only
as
a
prelude
to
those
more
general
applications
of
the
principles
of
socialism
which
are
held
in
some
quarters
to
be
so
necessary
chapter

now
the
reader
must
really
look
at
the
map
to
this
point
we
have
proceeded
by
train
and
steamer
with
all
the
power
and
swiftness
of
modern
communication
if
we
have
traversed
wild
and
lonely
lands
it
has
been
in
a
railway
carriage
we
have
disturbed
the
lion
with
the
locomotive
and
all
our
excursions
have
but
led
back
to
the
iron
road
but
at
ripon
falls
we
are
to
let
go
our
hold
upon
machinery
steam
and
all
it
means
is
to
be
shut
off
we
are
to
cut
the

and
losing

the
great

are
for
a

a
vast

of

hundred

forward
you
will
be
lucky

the

at
this

swift
and

in
a

it

impossible
going

great
pathways
are
being
cut

we
have
followed
for
nearly
a
thousand
miles
one
leading
from
the
east
towards
the
centre
far
away
from
the
north
another
line

been
thrust
forward

from

from

to
gondokoro
over
a
distance
of
nearly
three
thousand
miles
stretches
an
uninterrupted
service
of
trains
and
steamers
but
between
the
at
jinja
and
the
at
gondokoro
there
opens
a
wide
gulf
of
yet
unbridged
unconquered
wilderness
and
jungle
across
which
and
through
which
the
traveller
must
crawl
painfully
and
at
a
foot
pace
always
amid
difficulty
and
never
wholly
without
danger
it
is
this
gulf
which
we
are
now
to
traverse

the
distance
from
the
victoria
to
the
albert
nyanza
is
about
two
hundred
miles
in
the
direct
line
and
it
is
all
downhill
the
great
lake
is
hoisted
high
above
the
highest
of
england
from
this
vast
elevated
inland
sea
the
descending
nile
water
flows
through
a
channel
of
three
thousand
five
hundred
miles
into
the
mediterranean
the
first
and
steepest
stage
of
its
journey
is
to
the
albert
lake
this
second
body
of
water
which
except
in
comparison
with
the
victoria
nyanza
would
be
impressive
it
is
more
than
a
hundred
miles
long
lies
at
an
altitude
of
two
thousand
three
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
so
that
in
its
first
two
hundred
miles
the
nile
exhausts
in
the
exuberant
improvidence
of
youth
about
a
third
of
the
impulse
which
is
to
carry
it
through
its
venerable
career
yet
this
considerable
descent
of
twelve
hundred
feet
is
itself
accomplished
in
two
short
steps
there
is
one
series
of
rapids
thirty
miles
long
below
the
ripon
falls
and
another
of
equal
extent
above
the
murchison
falls
between
these
two
declivities
long
reaches
of
open
river
and
the
wide
level
expanse
of
lake
chioga
afford
a
fine
waterway
our
journey
from
one
great
lake
to
the
other
divided
itself
therefore
into
three
stages
three
marches
through
the
forest
to
kakindu
the
first
point
where
the
victoria
nile
is
navigable
after
the
rapids
three
days
in
canoes
along
the
nile
and
across
lake
chioga
and
lastly
five
marches
from
the
western
end
of
lake
chioga
to
the
albert
nyanza
beyond
this
again
four
days
in
canoes
and
steel
towed
by
a
launch
would
carry
us
to
nimule
where
the
rapids
on
the
white
nile
begin
and
in
seven
or
eight
marches
from
there
we
should
reach
the
soudan
steamers
at
gondokoro
about
five
hundred
miles
would
thus
be
covered
in
twenty
days
it
would
take
about
the
same
time
if
trains
and
steamers
fitted
exactly
to
return
by
mombasa
and
suez
to
london
early
in
the
morning
of
november
our
party
set
off
upon
this
journey
travelling
by
marches
from
camp
to
camp
plays
a
regular
part
in
the
life
of
the
average
central
african
officer
he
goes
on
safari
as
the
boer
on
trek
it
is
a
recognized
state
of
being
which
often
lasts
for
weeks
and
sometimes
for
months
he
learns
to
think
of
ten
days
safari
as
we
at
home
think
of
going
to
scotland
and
twenty
days
safari
as
if
it
were
less
than
the
journey
to
paris
safari
is
itself
a
swahili
word
of
arabic
origin
meaning
an
expedition
and
all
that
pertains
to
it
it
comprises
yourself
and
everybody
and
everything
you
take
with
you
food
tents
rifles
clothing
cooks
servants
escort
porters
but
especially
porters
out
of
the
range
of
steam
the
porter
is
the
primary
factor
this
ragged
figure
tottering
along
under
his
load
is
the
unit
of
locomotion
and
the
limit
of
possibility
without
porters
you
can
not
move
with
them
you
move
ten
or
twelve
miles
a
day
if
all
is
well
how
much
can
he
carry
how
far
can
he
carry
it
these
are
the
questions
which
govern
alike
your
calculations
and
your
fate
every
morning
the
porters
are
divided
into
batches
of
about
twenty
each
under
its
headman
the
loads
which
are
supposed
to
average
about
pounds
are
also
roughly
parcelled
out
as
each
batch
starts
off
the
next
rushes
up
to
the
succeeding
heap
of
loads
and
there
is
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
screaming
and
pushing
the
strongest
men
making
a
for
the
loads
and
being
beaten
off
by
the
grim
but
voluble
headman
the
weakest
weeping
feebly
beside
a
mountainous
pile
till
a
distribution
has
been
achieved
with
rough
justice
and
the
troop
in
its
turn
marches
off
with
indescribable
ululations
testifying
and
ministering
to
the
spirit
in
which
they
mean
to
accomplish
the
day
journey
while
these
problems
were
being
imperfectly
solved
i
walked
down
with
the
governor
and
one
of
the
engineer
officers
to
the
ripon
falls
which
are
but
half
a
mile
from
the
commissioner
house
and
the
sound
of
whose
waters
filled
the
air
although
the
cataract
is
on
a
moderate
scale
both
in
height
and
volume
its
aspect
and
still
more
its
situation
is
impressive
the
exit
or
overflow
of
the
great
lake
is
closed
by
a
natural
rampart
or
ridge
of
black
rock
broken
or
worn
away
in
two
main
gaps
to
release
the
waters
through
these
the
nile
leaps
at
once
into
majestic
being
and
enters
upon
its
course
as
a
perfect
river
three
hundred
yards
wide
standing
upon
the
reverse
side
of
the
wall
of
rock
one
eye
may
be
almost
on
a
plane
with
the
shining
levels
of
the
lake
at
your
very
feet
literally
a
yard
away
a
vast
green
slope
of
water
races
downward
below
are
foaming
rapids
fringed
by
splendid
trees
and
pools
from
which
great
fish
leap
continually
in
the
sunlight
we
must
have
spent
three
hours
watching
the
waters
and
revolving
plans
to
harness
and
bridle
them
so
much
power
running
to
waste
such
a
coign
of
vantage
unoccupied
such
a
lever
to
control
the
natural
forces
of
africa
ungripped
can
not
but
vex
and
stimulate
imagination
and
what
fun
to
make
the
immemorial
nile
begin
its
journey
by
diving
through
a
turbine
but
to
our
tale
illustration
forest
scene
near
ripon
falls
the
porters
had
by
now
got
far
on
their
road
and
we
must
pad
after
them
through
the
full
blaze
of
noon
the
governor
of
uganda
and
his
officers
have
to
return
to
entebbe
by
the
steamer
so
it
is
here
i
bid
them
and
good
luck
and
with
a
final
look
at
ripon
falls
gleaming
and
resounding
below
i
climb
the
slopes
of
the
river
bank
and
walk
off
into
the
forest
the
native
path
struck
from
the
nile
and
led
into
a
hilly
and
densely
wooded
region
the
on
each
side
of
the
track
rose
fifteen
feet
high
in
the
valleys
great
trees
grew
and
arched
above
our
heads
laced
and
twined
together
with
curtains
of
flowering
creepers
here
and
there
a
glade
opened
to
the
right
or
left
and
patches
of
vivid
sunlight
splashed
into
the
gloom
around
the
crossings
of
little
streams
butterflies
danced
in
brilliant
ballets
many
kinds
of
birds
flew
about
the
trees
the
jungle
was
haunted
by
game
utterly
lost
in
its
dense
entanglements
and
i
think
it
a
sensation
all
by
itself
to
walk
on
your
own
feet
and
staff
in
hand
along
these
mysterious
paths
amid
such
beautiful
yet
sinister
surroundings
and
realize
that
one
is
really
in
the
centre
of
africa
and
a
long
way
from
piccadilly
or
pall
mall
our
first
march
was
about
fourteen
miles
and
as
we
had
not
started
till
the
hot
hours
of
the
day
were
upon
us
it
was
enough
and
to
spare
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
and
wandered
our
path
now
plunged
in
the
twilight
of
a
forest
valley
now
winding
up
the
side
of
a
scorched
hill
and
i
had
for
some
time
been
hoping
to
see
the
camp
round
every
corner
when
at
last
we
reached
it
it
consisted
of
two
rows
of
green
tents
and
a
large
banda
or
as
big
as
a
large
barn
in
england
standing
in
a
nice
trim
clearing
these
bandas
are
a
great
feature
of
african
travel
and
the
dutiful
chief
through
whose
territory
we
are
passing
had
taken
pains
to
make
them
on
the
most
elaborate
scale
he
was
not
long
in
making
his
appearance
with
presents
of
various
kinds
a
lanky
sheep
with
a
fat
tail
as
big
as
a
pumpkin
was
dragged
forward
bleating
by
two
retainers
others
brought
live
hens
and
earthenware
jars
of
milk
and
baskets
of
little
round
eggs
the
chief
was
a
tall
man
with
the
winning
smile
and
attractive
manners
characteristic
of
the
country
and
made
his
salutations
with
a
fine
air
of
dignity
and
friendship

the
house
he
had
prepared
for
us
was
built
of
bamboo
framework
supported
upon
a
central
row
of
with
a
roof
heavily
thatched
with
and
walls
of
wattled

the
floors
of
african
bandas
when
newly
made
are
beautifully
smooth
and
clean
and
strewn
with
fresh
green
rushes
the
interior
is
often
cunningly
divided
into
various
apartments
and
the
main
building
is
connected
with
kitchens
and
offices
of
the
same
unsubstantial
texture
by
passages
in
fact
they
prove
a
high
degree
of
social
knowledge
and
taste
in
the
natives
who
make
them
with
almost
incredible
rapidity
from
the
vegetation
of
the
surrounding
jungle
and
the
sensation
of
entering
one
of
these
lofty
dim
cool
and
spacious
interiors
and
sinking
into
the
soft
of
the
floor
with
something
to
drink
which
is
at
any
rate
not
tepid
well
repays
the
glaring
severities
of
a
march
under
an
equatorial
sun
the
banda
however
is
a
luxury
of
which
the
traveller
should
beware
for
if
it
has
stood
for
more
than
a
week
it
becomes
the
home
of
innumerable
insects
many
of
approved
malevolence
and
venom
and
spirillum
fever
is
almost
invariably
caught
from
sleeping
in
old
shelters
or
on
disused
life
on
safari
is
rewarded
by
a
sense
of
completeness
and
detachment
you
have
got
to
do
so
many
miles
a
day
and
when
you
have
done
them
your
day
work
is
over
is
a
simple
programme
which
leaves
nothing
more
to
be
demanded
or
desired
very
early
in
the
morning
often
an
hour
before
daybreak
the
bugles
of

every
one
dresses
hurriedly
by
eats
a
dim
breakfast
while
dawn
approaches
tents
collapse
and
porters
struggle
off
with
their
burdens
then
the
march
begins
the
obvious
thing
is
to
walk
there
is
no
surer
way
of
keeping
well
in
uganda
than
to
walk
twelve
or
fourteen
miles
a
day
but
if
the
traveller
will
not
make
the
effort
there
are
alternatives
there
is
the
rickshaw
which
was
described
in
the
last
chapter
restful
but
tedious
and
the
litter
carried
on
the
heads
of
six
porters
of
different
sizes
and
shifted
every
now
and
then
with
a
disheartening
jerk
to
their
shoulders
and
back
again
this
is
quite
as
uncomfortable
as
it
sounds
ponies
can
not
or
at
least
do
not
live
in
uganda
though
an
experiment
was
just
about
to
be
made
with
them
by
the
chief
of
the
police
who
is
convinced
that
with
really
careful
stable
management
undertaken
in
detail
by
the
owner
himself
they
could
be
made
to
flourish
mules
have
a
better
chance
though
still
not
a
good
one
we
took
one
with
us
on
the
last
spell
of
safari
to
gondokoro
and
were
told
it
was
sure
to
die
but
we
left
it
in
apparently
excellent
condition
and
spirits
illustration
an
encampment
but
the
best
of
all
methods
of
progression
in
central
africa
however
astonishing
it
may
seem
is
the
bicycle
in
the
dry
season
the
paths
through
the
bush
smoothed
by
the
feet
of
natives
afford
an
excellent
surface
even
when
the
track
is
only
two
feet
wide
and
when
the
densest
jungle
rises
on
either
side
and
almost
meets
above
the
head
the
bicycle
skims
along
swishing
through
the
grass
and
brushing
the
encroaching
bushes
at
a
fine
pace
and
although
at
every
few
hundred
yards
sharp
rocks
loose
stones
a
or
a
steep
hill
compel
dismounting
a
good
seven
miles
an
hour
can
usually
be
maintained
and
think
what
this
means
from
my
own
experience
i
should
suppose
that
with
a
bicycle
to
thirty
miles
a
day
could
regularly
be
covered
in
uganda
and
if
only
the
porters
could
keep
up
all
journeys
could
be
nearly
trebled
and
every
white
radius
of
action
proportionately
increased
nearly
all
the
british
officers
i
met
already
possessed
and
used
bicycles
and
even
the
native
chiefs
are
beginning
to
acquire
them
but
what
is
needed
to
make
the
plan
effective
is
a
good
system
of
stone
fumigated
at
stages
of
thirty
miles
on
all
the
main
lines
of
communication
such
a
development
would
mean
an
enormous
saving
in
the
health
of
white
officials
and
a
valuable
accession
to
their
power
had
i
known
myself
before
coming
to
uganda
the
advantages
which
this
method
presents
i
should
have
been
able
to
travel
far
more
widely
through
the
country
by
the
simple
expedient
of
trebling
the
stages
of
my
journeys
and
sending
porters
on
a
week
in
advance
to
pitch
camps
and
deposit
food
at
wide
intervals
and
then
instead
of
merely
journeying
from
one
great
lake
to
the
other
i
could
the
same
limits
of
have
explored
the
fertile
and
populous
plateau
of
toro
descended
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
semliki
and
traversed
the
albert
lake
from
end
to
end
and
skirted
the
slopes
of
ruenzori
if
youth
but
knew
but
the
march
however
performed
has
its
termination
and
if
as
is
recommended
you
stop
to
breakfast
and
rest
upon
the
way
the
new
camp
will
be
almost
ready
upon
arrival
during
the
heat
of
the
day
every
one
retires
to
his
tent
or
to
the
more
effective
shelter
of
the
banda
to
read
and
sleep
till
the
evening
then
as
the
sun
gets
low
we
emerge
to
smoke
and
talk
and
there
is
perhaps
just
time
for
the
energetic
to
pursue
an
antelope
or
shoot
a
few
or
pigeons
with
the
approach
of
twilight
comes
the
mosquito
and
and
the
most
thorough
precautions
have
to
be
taken
against
him
and
other
insect
dangers
we
dine
in
a
large
made
entirely
of
fine
gauze
and
about
twelve
feet
cubically
the
bedding
which
should
if
possible
be
packed
in
tin
boxes
is
unrolled
during
the
day
and
carefully
protected
by
well
tucked
in
against
all
forms
of
vermin
every
one
puts
on
long
soft
leather
leggings
reaching
to
the
hips
you
are
recommended
not
to
sit
on
chairs
without
putting
a
newspaper
or
a
cushion
on
them
to
wear
a
cap
a
scarf
and
possibly
gloves
and
to
carry
a
swishing
thus
one
moves
comparatively
secure
amid
a
chorus
of
ferocious
buzzings
to
these
precautions
are
added
others
you
must
never
walk
barefoot
on
the
floor
no
matter
how
clean
it
is
or
an
odious
worm
called
a
jigger
will
enter
your
foot
to
raise
a
numerous
family
and
a
painful
swelling
on
the
other
hand
be
sure
when
you
put
on
boots
or
shoes
that
however
hurried
you
turn
them
upside
down
and
look
inside
lest
a
scorpion
a
small
snake
or
a
perfectly
frightful
kind
of
centipede
may
be
lying
in
ambush
never
throw
your
clothes
carelessly
upon
the
ground
but
put
them
away
at
once
in
a
tin
box
and
shut
it
tight
or
a
perfect
colony
of
creatures
will
beset
them
and
above
all
quinine
to
the
permanent
resident
in
these
strange
countries
no
drug
can
be
of
much
avail
for
either
its
protection
is
diminished
with
habit
or
the
doses
have
to
be
increased
to
impossible
limits
but
the
traveller
who
is
passing
through
on
a
journey
of
only
a
few
months
may
recur
with
safety
and
with
high
advantage
to
that
admirable
prophylactic
opinions
differ
as
to
how
it
should
be
taken
the
germans
with
their
love
of
exactness
even
in
regard
to
the
most
uncertain
things
prescribe
thirty
grains
on
each
seventh
day
and
eighth
day
alternately
we
followed
a
simpler
plan
of
taking
a
regular
ten
grains
every
day
from
the
moment
we
left
port
said
till
we
arrived
at
khartoum
no
one
in
my
party
suffered
from
fever
even
for
a
day
during
the
whole
journey
our
second
day
march
was
about
the
same
in
length
and
character
except
that
we
were
nearer
the
river
and
as
the
path
led
through
the
twilight
of
the
forest
we
saw
every
now
and
then
a
gleam
of
broad
waters
on
our
left
at
frequent
intervals
five
or
six
times
during
the
day
long
caravans
of
native
porters
were
met
carrying
the
produce
of
the
fertile
districts
between
lake
chioga
and
mount
elgon
into
jinja
nothing
could
better
show
the
need
of
improved
communications
than
this
incipient
and
potential
trade
ready
to
begin
and
thrusting
forward
along
on
the
heads
of
tottering
men
for
the
rest
the
country
near
the
river
seemed
the
densest
and
most
impenetrable
jungle
hiding
in
its
recesses
alike
its
inhabitants
and
its
game
the
third
morning
however
brought
us
among
shambas
as
the
patches
of
native
cultivation
are
called
and
the
road
was
among
plantations
of
bananas
millet
cotton
and
chilies
here
in
usoga
as
throughout
uganda
the
one
staple
crop
is
the
banana
and
as
this
fruit
when
once
planted
grows
and
propagates
of
its
own
accord
requiring
no
thought
or
exertion
it
finds
special
favour
with
the
improvident
natives
and
sustains
them
year
after
year
in
leisured
abundance
till
a
sudden
failure
and
a
fearful
famine
restore
the
harsh
balances
of
the
world
after
a
tramp
of
twelve
miles
and
while
it
was
still
comparatively
early
for
we
had
started
before
dawn
we
reached
kakindu
the
track
led
out
of
the
forest
of
downwards
into
more
open
spaces
and
blazing
sunlight
and
there
before
us
was
the
nile
already
forty
miles
from
its
source
near
four
thousand
from
its
mouth
it
was
a
noble
river
nearly
a
third
of
a
mile
in
breadth
of
clear
deep
water
rolling
forward
majestically
between
banks
of
foliage
and
verdure
the
chioga
flotilla
consisting
of
the
small
steam
launch
a
steel
boat
and
two
or
three
canoes
scooped
out
of
awaited
us
and
after
the
long
hot
business
of
embarking
the
baggage
and
crowding
the
native
servants
in
among
it
was
completed
we
parted
from
our
first
relay
of
escorts
and
porters
and
drifted
out
on
the
flood
the
next
three
days
of
our
life
were
spent
on
the
water
first
cruising
down
the
victoria
nile
till
it
flows
into
chioga
and
then
traversing
the
smooth
limpid
expanses
of
that
lake
every
evening
we
landed
at
camps
prepared
by
the
busoga
chiefs
pitched
our
tents
lighted
our
fires
and
erected
our
while
dusk
drew
on
and

frequent
at
this
season
of
the
year

in
vivid
splendour
about
the
dark
horizon
all
through
the
hot
hours
of
the
day
one
lay
at
the
bottom
of
massive
canoes
sheltered
from
the
sun
by
an
improvised
roof
of
rushes
and
wet
grass
from
time
to
time
a
strange
bird
or
better
still
the
rumour
of
a
hippo
nose
just
peeping
above
the
water
enlivened
the
slow
and
sultry
passage
of
the
hours
and
one
great
rock
crowded
with
enormous
crocodiles
all
of
whom
a
score
at
least
leaped
together
into
the
water
at
the
first
shot
afforded
at
least
one
really
striking
spectacle
as
the
victoria
nile
approaches
lake
chioga
it
broadens
out
into
wide
lagoons
and
the
sloping
banks
of
forest
and
jungle
give
place
to
unbroken
walls
of
behind
which
the
flat
surrounding
country
is
invisible
and
above
which
only
an
isolated
triangular
hill
may
here
and
there
be
descried
purple
in
the
distance
the
lake
itself
is
about
fifty
miles
long
from
east
to
west
and
eleven
broad
but
its
area
and
perimeter
are
greatly
extended
by
a
series
of
long
arms
or
rather
fingers
stretching
out
in
every
direction
but
especially
to
the
north
and
affording
access
by
water
to
very
wide
and
various
districts
all
these
arms
and
even
a
great
part
of
the
centre
of
the
lake
are
filled
with
reeds

and
for
chioga
is
the
first
of
the
great
sponges
upon
which
the
nile
lavishes
its
waters

a
depth
of
about
twelve
feet
can
usually
be
counted
on

is
impeded
by
floating
weeds
and
and
when
the
storms
have
swept
the
northern
shore
numerous
islands
complete
with
their
populations
of
birds
and
animals
are
detached
and

erratically
about
the

to
block
accustomed
channels
and
puzzle

plashed
through
this
curious

times

through

a
dozen
yards
across
then
presently
emerging
into
wide
flood
stopping
often
to
clear
our
propeller
from
tangles
of
accumulating
greenery
the
middle
of
the
lake
unrolls
large
expanses
of
placid
water
the
banks
and
reeds
recede
into

the
whole

rimmed
round
its
middle
by
a
thin
band
of
vivid
green
time
vanishes
and
nothing
is
left
but
space
and
sunlight
all
this
while
we
must
carefully
avoid
the
northern
and
particularly
the
shore
for
the
natives
are
altogether
unadministered
and
nearly
all
the
tribes
are
hostile
to
pursue
the
elephants
which
of
course
so
they
say
abound
in
these
forbidden
precincts
is
impossible
to
land
for
food
or
fuel
would
be
dangerous
and
even
to
approach
might
draw
a
splutter
of
musketry
or
a
shower
of
spears
from
his
majesty

unpersuaded
subjects
the
nile

the

that

a

surrounded
by

over

danced

the

this
had
to
be
towed
painfully
out

this
journey
by
way
of
masindi
would
have
required
four
marches
but
tales
of
the
beauty
and
wonder
of
the
murchison
falls
had
captivated
my
mind
and
before
embarking
at
kakindu
a
new
plan
had
been
resolved
runners
were
sent
back
to
the
telegraph
wire
at
jinja
and
thence
a
message
was
flashed
by
kampala
to
hoima
directing
the
flotilla
which
awaited
us
there
to
steam
to
the
north
end
of
the
albert
and
meet
us
by
the
foot
of
the
murchison
falls
at
fajao
thither
we
were
now
to
proceed
by
five
marches
two
to
masindi
and
three
more
turning
northward
to
the
nile
the
road
from
mruli
consists
of
a
sort
of
embanked
track
through
and
desolate
scrub
and
jungle
the
heavy
black
cotton
soil
cracked
and
granulated
by
the
heat
offered
at
this
time
a
hardened
if
uneven
surface
to
the
bicycle
but
in
the
rains
such
paths
must
become
utterly
impassable
as
one
advances
westward
the
country
improves
rapidly
in
aspect
the
dismal
flats
of
the
south
chioga
shore
are
left
behind
and
the
traveller
discovers
more
characteristic
uganda
scenery
in
a
region
of
small
hills
and
great
trees
before
masindi
is
reached
we
are
again
in
a
rich
and
beautiful
land
pools
of
shining
water
set
in
verdant
green
flash
back
the
sunbeams
bold
bluffs
and
ridges
rise
on
all
sides
from
amid
the
unceasing
undulations
of
the
ground
streams
plash
merrily
downwards
through
rocky
channels
the
yellow
grass
roofs
of
frequent
villages
peep
from
underneath
their
groves
of
bananas
among
broad
streaks
of
cultivated
ground
and
chiefs
and
headmen
salute
the
stranger
with
grave
yet
curious
politeness
as
the
long
safari
winds
beneath
the
trees
the
heat
grows
as
the
altitude
dwindles
and
even
in
the
early
morning
the
sun
sits
hard
and
heavy
on
the
shoulders
at
ten
its
power
is
tremendous
so
long
as
the
roadway
consisted
of
nobbly
lumps
of
black
cotton
soil
bicycling
though
possible
in
places
was
scarcely
pleasant
but
the
change
in
the
landscape
arises
from
the
change
in
the
soil
the
fields
are
now
of
bright
red
earth
the
paths
of
red
sandstone
washed
in
places
almost
as
smooth
and
as
firm
as
asphalt
by
the
rains
and
sparkling
with
crystalline
dust
and
when
the
ridges
which
form
the
watershed
between
lake
chioga
and
lake
albert
had
been
topped
my
bicycle
glided
almost
without
impulsion
down
four
miles
of
gradual
descent
into
masindi
this
station
which
is
the
residence
of
a
collector
lies
embosomed
in
a
wide
bay
of
hills
clothed
with
noble
trees
it
is
indeed
a
pleasant
spot
there
are
real
houses
standing
on
high
stone
platforms
with
deep
verandas
and
wire
gauze
windows
the
roads
are
laid
out
in
bold
geometry
of
broad
red
lines
there
are
avenues
of
planted
trees
delicious
banks
of
flowers
a
prepared
breakfast
not
cool
drinks
a
telegraph
office
and
a
file
of
the
what
more
could
an
explorer
desire
or
the
fates
accord
we
were
now
to
strike
northwards
to
the
nile
at
fajao
in
three
long
marches
for
the
porters
of
about
sixteen
miles
each
upon
the
hoima
road
some
preparations
had
been
made
to
make
the
journey
easier
by
clearing
the
encroaching
jungle
from
the
track
and
constructing
but
my
change
of
plan
had
disconcerted
these
arrangements
and
on
the
new
route
we
had
to
clear
our
own
paths
from
the
overgrowth
by
which
even
in
a
season
if
unused
they
are
choked
and
to
trust
to
tents
and
improvised
shelters
progress
was
therefore
slow
and
camps
unpretentious
but
all
was
redeemed
by
the
wonders
of
the
scene
for
a
whole
day
we
crept
through
the
skirts
of
the
hoima
forest
amid
an
exuberance
of
vegetation
which
is
scarcely
describable
i
had
travelled
through
tropical
forests
in
cuba
and
india
and
had
often
before
admired
their
enchanting
yet
sinister
luxuriance
but
the
forests
of
uganda
for
magnificence
for
variety
of
form
and
colour
for
profusion
of
brilliant
life
plant
bird
insect
reptile
beast
for
the
vast
scale
and
awful
fecundity
of
the
natural
processes
that
are
beheld
at
work
eclipsed
and
indeed
effaced
all
previous
impressions
one
becomes
not
without
a
secret
sense
of
aversion
the
spectator
of
an
intense
convulsion
of
life
and
death
reproduction
and
decay
are
locked
struggling
in
infinite
embraces
in
this
glittering
equatorial
slum
huge
trees
jostle
one
another
for
room
to
live
slender
growths
stretch
upwards
as
it
seems
in
agony
towards
sunlight
and
life
the
soil
bursts
with
irrepressible
vegetations
every
victor
trampling
on
the
rotting
mould
of
exterminated
antagonists
soars
aloft
only
to
encounter
another
host
of
aerial
rivals
to
be
burdened
with
masses
of
parasitic
foliage
smothered
in
the
glorious
blossoms
of
creepers
laced
and
bound
and
interwoven
with
interminable
tangles
of
vines
and
trailers
birds
are
as
bright
as
butterflies
butterflies
are
as
big
as
birds
the
air
hums
with
flying
creatures
the
earth
crawls
beneath
your
foot
the
runs
northward
to
gondokoro
through
this
vegetable
labyrinth
even
its
poles
had
broken
into
bud
as
we
advanced
continually
rising
or
falling
with
the
waves
of
the
land
and
moving
in
rapid
alternations
from
a
blazing
patch
of
sunshine
into
a
cloistered
dimness
every
now
and
then
the
path
became
smooth
broad
and
of
firm
sandstone
and
here
one
could
watch
the
columns
of
marching
perhaps
in
a
hundred
yards
the
road
would
be
crossed
four
times
by
these
fierce
armies
they
move
in
regular
array
and
upon
purposes
at
once
inscrutable
and
unswerving
a
brown
band
perhaps
two
inches
broad
and
an
inch
and
a
half
is
drawn
across
your
track
its
ends
are
lost
in
the
recesses
of
the
jungle
it
moves
unceasingly
and
with
a
multiplied
rapidity
for
each
ant
runs
swiftly
forward
whether
upon
the
ground
or
upon
the
backs
of
his
already
moving
comrades
about
a
yard
away
on
each
side
of
the
main
column
are
the
screening
lines
of
the
and
for
five
yards
beyond
this
every
inch
is
searched
every
object
is
examined
by
tireless
and
fearless
reconnoitring
patrols
woe
to
the
enemy
who
is
overtaken
by
these
hordes
no
matter
what
his
size
or
nature
he
is
attacked
at
once
by
an
number
of
assailants
each
one
of
whom
upon
remorseless
instinct
plunges
his
strong
mandibles
in
the
flesh
and
will
have
his
head
pulled
off
his
shoulders
rather
than
let
go
these
ant
armies
fascinated
me
i
could
not
resist
interfering
with
them
with
my
i
gently
broke
the
column
and
pushed
the
swarming
rope
off
its
line
of
march
their
surprise
their
confusion
their
indignation
were
extreme
but
not
for
an
instant
did
they
pause
in
a
second
the
scouts
were
running
all
over
my
boots
eagerly
seeking
an
entry
and
when
i
looked
back
from
this
to
the
i
held
it
was
already
alive
with
a
gesture
so
nimble
that
it
might
have
been
misunderstood
i
cast
it
from
me
and
jumped
back
out
of
the
danger
circle
until
i
found
refuge
on
a
large
rock
at
a
respectful
distance
the
soudanese
of
the
escort
a
splendid
negro
drilled
as
smart
as
a
grenadier
guardsman
and
with
a
good
long
row
of
medal
ribbons
on
his
khaki
tunic
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
grin
from
ear
to
ear
but
his
gravity
was
fully
restored
when
i
invited
him
to
rescue
my
which
lay
abandoned
on
the
field
in
the
mandibles
of
the
victorious
enemy
the
devoted
man
was
however
equal
to
the
crisis
i
have
a
sad
tale
also
to
tell
of
the
perversity
of
butterflies
never
were
seen
such
flying
fairies
they
flaunted
their
splendid
liveries
in
inconceivable
varieties
of
colour
and
pattern
in
our
faces
at
every
step
fritillaries
admirals
peacocks
all
executed
in
at
least
a
dozen
novel
and
contrasted
styles
with
many
even
more
beautiful
but
bearing
no
resemblance
to
our
british
species
flitted
in
sunshine
from
flower
to
flower
glinted
in
the
shadow
of
great
trees
or
clustered
on
the
path
to
suck
the
moisture
from
any
swampy
patch
the
butterfly
is
a
dirty
feeder
and
if
ever
some
piece
of
putrescent
filth
lay
odorous
on
the
ground
be
sure
it
would
be
covered
with
a
cloud
of
these
greedy
insects
come
in
such
gay
attire
to
eat
such
sorry
meat
i
found
them
sometimes
so
intoxicated
with
feasting
that
i
could
pick
them
up
quite
gently
in
my
fingers
without
the
need
of
any
net
at
all
to
any
one
who
has
ever
tried
to
collect
the
modest
and
now
all
too
rare
and
scattered
butterflies
of
britain
these
sights
could
not
but
be
a
hard
temptation
for
a
week
i
had
resisted
it
not
because
it
was
not
easy
enough
to
make
a
net
but
because
of
the
difficulty
of
setting
and
preserving
the
prizes
and
it
was
not
until
the
end
of
our
first
day
march
out
from
masindi
that
i
was
told
that
much
the
best
way
of
sending
butterflies
home
from
africa
was
to
enclose
them
in
triangles
of
paper
and
leave
them
to
be
set
in
london
forthwith
out
of
and
a
net
was
made
and
before
another
dawn
i
was
fully
equipped
it
is
almost
incredible
to
state
that
from
that
very
moment
except
near
the
murchison
falls
i
scarcely
ever
saw
a
really
fine
butterfly
again
all
the
way
to
gondokoro
whether
this
was
due
to
the
intelligent
perversity
of
these
insects
or
to
the
fact
that
we
had
left
the
deeper
recesses
of
the
forest
region
i
do
not
inquire
but
the
fact
remains
and
i
carry
away
from
the
butterflies
of
uganda
only
the
haunting
memories
of
unrealized
opportunity
this
first
day
march
from
masindi
was
a
long
one
and
our
porters
panted
and
toiled
under
their
loads
through
the
heat
of
the
day
it
was
not
till
the
afternoon
that
the
main
body
came
into
camp
and
stragglers
trickled
through
into
the
dusk
meanwhile
the
local
natives
built
under
our
eyes
with
extraordinary
speed
and
cleverness
a
spacious
and
two
or
three
quite
excellent
bedrooms
from
the
surrounding
and
bamboo
groves
and
we
fared
as
comfortably
in
these
two
humble
dwellings
as
if
we
dwelt
in
palaces
the
forest
was
a
little
thinner
on
the
second
day
although
the
jungle
was
of
the
same
dense
and
tangled
fertility
we
started
an
hour
before
sunrise
and
by
eight
had
climbed
to
the
saddle
of
the
high
rocky
wall
which
contains
the
valley
of
the
victoria
nile
from
this
elevation
of
perhaps
six
hundred
feet
above
the
general
level
of
the
plain
a
comprehensive
view
of
the
landscape
was
for
the
first
time
possible
in
every
direction
spread
a
wide
sea
of
foliage
thinning
here
into
bush
darkening
there
into
forest
rising
and
falling
with
the
waves
of
the
land
and
broken
only
by
occasional
peaks
of
rock
far
away
to
the
a
long
silver
gleam
just
discernible
through
the
haze
of
the
horizon
revealed
to
our
eyes
the
distant
prospect
of
the
albert
nyanza
the
camera
can
not
do
justice
to
such
a
panorama
in
photographs
these
vast
expanses
look
like
mere
scrubby
commons
inhospitable
and
monotonous
to
the
eye
melancholy
to
the
soul
one
has
to
remember
that
here
are
kew
gardens
and
the
zoo
combined
on
an
unlimited
scale
that
nature
central
productive
laboratory
is
here
working
night
and
day
at
full
blast
and
that
the
scrubby
common
of
the
picture
is
really
a
fairyland
of
glades
and
vistas
through
which
an
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
might
march
without
the
glint
of
a
bayonet
or
even
the
dust
of
an
artillery
column
betraying
their
presence
to
the
watcher
on
the
crag
our
camp
this
night
lay
in
a
tiny
patch
cleared
in
the
heart
of
this
wild
world
the
cluster
of
tents
under
a
canopy
of
palms
illumined
by
the
bright
with
lanterns
and
busy
with
the
moving
figures
of
men
and
the
hum
of
human
activity
seemed
at
a
hundred
yards
distance
an
island
of
society
amid
an
ocean
of
nature
to
what
strange
perils
apart
altogether
from
the
certainty
of
losing
your
way
would
a
walk
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
any
direction
expose
the
wanderer
to
withdraw
from
the
firelight
was
to
be
engulfed
in
the
savage
conditions
of
prehistoric
time
advance
and
the
would
tell
you
the
latest
quotations
of
the
london
markets
the
figures
of
the
newest
an
odd
sensation
illustration
murchison
falls
we
had
scarce
proceeded
for
an
hour
on
our
third
march
when
just
as
it
grew
daylight
a
low
vibrant
murmur
began
to
be
perceptible
in
the
air
now
it
was
lost
as
we
descended
into
some
moist
valley
now
it
broke
even
more
strongly
on
the
ear
as
we
reached
the
summit
of
some
ascent
the
sound
of
the
nile
plunging
down
the
murchison
falls
and
by
nine
when
we
were
still
about
ten
miles
off
a
loud
insistent
and
unceasing
hum
had
developed
these
falls
are
certainly
the
most
remarkable
in
the
whole
course
of
the
nile
at
foweira
the
navigable
reaches
stretching
from
lake
chioga
are
interrupted
by
cataracts
and
the
river
hurries
along
in
foam
and
rapid
down
a
gradual
but
continuous
stairway
enclosed
by
rocky
walls
but
still
a
broad
flood
two
miles
above
fajao
these
walls
contract
suddenly
till
they
are
six
yards
and
through
this
strangling
portal
as
from
the
nozzle
of
a
hose
the
whole
tremendous
river
is
shot
in
one
single
jet
down
an
abyss
of
a
hundred
and
sixty
feet
the
escarpment
over
which
the
nile
falls
curves
away
in
a
vast
bay
of
precipitous
or
almost
precipitous
cliffs
broken
here
and
there
by
more
gradual
rifts
and
forms
the
eastern
wall
of
the
albert
lake
from
whose
waters
it
rises
abruptly
in
many
places
to
a
height
of
six
or
seven
hundred
feet
arrived
at
the
verge
of
this
descent
the
lower
reaches
of
the
victoria
nile
could
be
discerned
stretching
away
mile
after
mile
in
a
broad
gleaming
ribbon
almost
to
its
mouth
on
the
lake
the
falls
themselves
were
indeed
invisible
concealed
behind
a
forested
bluff
but
their
roaring
left
no
doubt
of
their
presence
below
me
a
zigzag
path
led
down
by
long
descents
to
the
water
edge
and
on
an
open
meadow
a
row
of
tents
and
grass
houses
had
already
been
set
up
fajao
as
a
native
town
was
no
more
at
hardly
any
point
in
uganda
has
the
sleeping
sickness
made
such
frightful
ravages
at
least
six
thousand
persons
had
perished
in
the
last
two
years
almost
the
whole
population
had
been
swept
away
scarcely
enough
remained
to
form
the
deputation
who
in
their
white
robes
could
be
distinguished
at
the
entrance
to
the
cleared
area
of
the
and
this
cleared
area
was
itself
of
the
utmost
importance
for
all
around
it
the
powers
of
evil
were
strong
the
groves
which
fringed
and
overhung
the
river
swarmed
with
tsetse
flies
of
venom
and
approved
malignity
and
no
man
could
enter
them
except
at
a
risk
after
pausing
for
a
few
minutes
to
watch
a
troop
of
baboons
who
were
leaping
about
from
tree
to
tree
on
the
opposite
hill
and
who
seemed
as
big
as
men
i
climbed
down
the
zigzag
photographed
the
deputation
and
shook
hands
with
the
chief
he
was
a
very
civilized
chief
by
name
james
kago
who
wore
and
leather
gaiters
and
who
spoke
a
few
unexpected
sentences
of
excellent
english
he
seemed
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
so
did
the
remnant
of
the
population
who
gathered
behind
him
though
whether
this
was
due
to
stoical
philosophy
or
good
manners
i
could
not
tell
all
was
smiles
and
bows
and
gurglings
of
guttural
gratification
the
district
officer
who
had
travelled
with
me
explained
that
the
chief
had
had
the
path
up
to
the
top
of
the
falls
improved
and
that
he
proposed
after
we
had
lunched
and
rested
to
guide
us
along
it
to
the
very
edge
of
the
abyss
but
that
the

were

the

were
such

was

great

again

one
leap

then
it
was
my
turn
to
be
astonished
the
river
at

distance
from

was
not
broader
than
three
hundred

and
we
could
see
the

plainly

to

at

sprang
into

my

and
i
saw
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
crocodiles
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
rushing
madly
into
the
nile
whose
waters
along
the
line
of
the
shore
were
lashed
into
white
foam
exactly
as
if
a
heavy
wave
had
broken
it
could
be
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
at
least
a
thousand
of
these
saurians
had
been
disturbed
at
a
single
shot
our
british
friends
explained
that
fajao
was
the
favourite
haunt
of
the
crocodiles
who
lay
in
the
water
below
the
falls
waiting
for
dead
fish

over
by

are
wonderful
to

much

that
is
impressive

because

precipitated
through
such
a

indeed
seeing
the
great
size
of
the

the
falls
it
seemed
impossible
to
believe
that
it
was
wholly
supplied
from
this

spout

amid

it

that
the
falling

must
have
arched

caved
away
the

an
extraordinary

upon

a

yards
from

seemed
to
have
got
herself
hard

fast
for

as
we
might
with
all
the

at

to

and
when
she
had
thus
been
lightened
and
her
freight
transferred
to
the
attendant
canoes
james
kago
ordered
his
tribesmen
to
leap
into
the
water
which
was
not
more
than
five
feet
deep
and
push
and
lift
the
little
vessel
whilst
the
steamer
tugged
but
this
task
the
natives
were
most
reluctant
to
perform
out
of
fear
of
the
crocodiles
who
might
at
any
moment
make
a
pounce
notwithstanding
all
the
noise
and
clatter
thereupon
the
energetic
chief
seized
hold
of
them
one
after
another
round
the
waist
and
threw
them
into
the
stream

at

twenty
were
accumulated
round

then
what
with
their
impatience
to
finish
their
uncomfortable
job

our
straining
tow

the
floated

was
reloaded
and
we
were
off

out
into

view
of

upon
us
it
was
already
almost
daylight
but
the
sun
had
not

topped
the
great
escarpment
over
which
the
nile
descends

sides

and
lofty

rising

portals
of
the
falls
were
jetty
black
and
between
them
illumined
by
a
single
shaft
of
sunlight
gleamed
the
tremendous
cataract
a
thing
of
wonder
and
glory
well
worth
travelling
all
the
way
to
see
we
were
soon
among
the
hippopotami
every
two
or
three
hundred
yards
and
at
every
bend
of
the
river
we
came
upon
a
herd
of
from
five
to
twenty
to
us
in
a
steam
launch
they
threatened
no
resistance
or
danger
but
their
inveterate
hostility
to
canoes
leads
to
repeated
loss
of
life

the
native
fishermen
whose
frail
craft
are
crumpled
like
eggshells
in
the
snap
of
enormous
jaws
indeed
all
the
way
from
here
to
nimule
they
are
declared
to
be
the
scourge
and
terror
of
the
nile
fancy
mistaking
a
hippopotamus
almost
the
largest
surviving
mammal
in
the
world
for
a
water
lily
yet
nothing
is
more
easy
the
whole
river
is
dotted
with
floating
lilies
detached
from
any
root
and
drifting
along
contentedly
with
the
current
it
is
the
habit
of
the
hippo
to
loll
in
the
water
showing
only
his
eyes
and
the
tips
of
his
ears
and
perhaps
now
and
again
a
glimpse
of
his
nose
and
thus
concealed
his
silhouette
is
at
three
hundred
yards
almost
indistinguishable
from
the
floating
vegetation
i
thought
they
also
looked
like
giant
cats
peeping
so
soon
however
as
they
saw
us
coming
round
a
corner
and
heard
the
throbbing
of
the
propeller
they
would
raise
their
whole
heads
out
of
the
water
to
have
a
look
and
then
immediately
dive
to
the
bottom
in
disgust
our
practice
was
then
to
shut
off
steam
and
drift
silently
down
upon
them
in
this
way
one
arrives
in
the
middle
of
the
herd
and
when
curiosity
or
want
of
air
compels
them
to
come
up
again
there
is
a
chance
of
a
shot
one
great
fellow
came
up
to
breathe
within
five
yards
of
the
boat
and
the
look
of
astonishment
of
alarm
of
indignation
in
his
large
expressive
eyes
as
with
one
vast
snort
he
plunged
below
was
comical
to
see
these
creatures
are
not
easy
to
kill
they
bob
up
in
the
most
unexpected
quarters
and
are
down
again
in
a
second
one
does
not
like
to
run
the
risk
of
merely
wounding
them
and
the
target
presented
is
small
and
vanishing

one
who
sunk
with
a
harsh
sort
of
scream
and
thud
of
striking
bullet
we
waited
about
a
long
time
for
him
to
float
up
to
the
surface
but
in
vain
for
he
must
have
been
carried
into

it

that
somewhere

precise
there
was
a
place
known
only
to
the
elect

not

more
than
one
or
two
of
them
where
elephants
abounded
and
rhinoceros
swarmed

were
none

more
like

except
for
the

myself
it
was
indeed
delightful
to
lie
fanned
by
cool
breezes
and
lulled
by
the
soothing
lappings
of
the
ripples
and
to
watch
as

we
were
at
wadelai
in
hours
from
leaving
fajao
we
had
made
nearly
a
hundred
miles
of
our
voyage
without
the
sigh
of
a
single
porter
these
small
boats
and
launch
had
transported
the
whole
of
our
safari
over
a
distance
which
would
on

have
required
the
labours
and
sufferings
of
three
hundred
men
during
at
least
a
week
of
unbroken
effort
such
are
the
contrasts
which
impress
upon
one
the
importance
of
utilising
the
of
central
africa
of
establishing
a
complete
circulation
along
them
and
of
using
railways
in
the
first
instance
merely
to
link
them
together

of

the

these

be
swallowed
by

the
uganda
government
also
is
reducing
its

and

in

and
the
traveller
sees
not
without
melancholy
the
spectacle
of
civilization
definitely
in
retreat
after
more
than
half
a
century
of
effort
and
experiment
we
disembarked
and
climbed
the
slopes
through
high
rank
grass
and
scattered
boulders
till
we
stood
amidst
the
rotting
bungalows
and
shanties
of
what
had
been
a
bold
bid
for
the
existence
of
a
town
wadelai
had
been
occupied
by
white
men
perhaps
for
fifty
years
for
half
a
century
that
feeble
of
modernity
of
cigarettes
of
newspapers
of
whisky
and
pickles
had
burned
on
the
lonely
banks
of
the
white
nile
to
encourage
and
beckon
the
pioneer
and
settler
none
had
followed
now
it
was
extinguished
and
yet
when
i
surveyed
the
spacious
landscape
with
its
green
expanses
its
lofty
peaks
its
trees
its
verdure
rising
from
the
brink
of
the
mighty
and
majestic
river
i
could
not
bring
myself
for
a
moment
to
believe
that
civilization
has
done
with
the
nile
province
or
the
lado
enclave
or
that
there
is
no
future
for
regions
which
promise
so
much
all
through
the
day
we
paddled
prosperously
with
the
stream
at
times
the
nile
lost
itself
in
labyrinths
of
papyrus
which
reproduced
the
approaches
to
lake
chioga
and
through
which
we
threaded
a
tortuous
course
with
many
bumps
and
brushings
at
the
bends
but
more
often
the
banks
were
good
firm
earth
with
here
and
there
beautiful
cliffs
of
red
sandstone
hollowed
by
the
water
and
rising
abruptly
from
its
brim
crowned
with
luxuriant
foliage
in
places
these
cliffs
were
pierced
by
narrow
roadways
almost
tunnels
winding
up
to
the
high
ground
and
perfectly
smooth
and
regular
in
their
construction
they
looked
as
if
they
were
made
on
purpose
to
give
access
to
and
from
the
river
and
so
they
had
been
by
the
elephants
legions
of
inhabited
the
reeds
and
troops
of
cranes
rose
at
the
approach
of
the
flotilla
sometimes
we
saw
great
big
pelican
kind
of
birds
almost
as
big
as
a
man
standing
contemplative
on
a
single
leg
and
often
on
the
a
glorious
in
bronze
and
cream
sat
sunning
himself
and
watching
for
a
prey
i
stopped
once
in
the
hope
of
catching
butterflies
but
found
none
of
distinction
only
a
profuse
variety
of
common
types
a
high
level
of
mediocrity
without
beauties
or
commanders
and
swarms
of
ferocious
mosquitoes
prepared
to
dispute
the
ground
against
all
comers
and
it
was
nearly
four
in
the
afternoon
when
the
launch
suddenly
jinked
to
the
left
out
of
the
main
stream
into
a
small
bay
five
hundred
yards
across
and
we
came
to
land
at
hippo
camp
illustration
the
kenia
james
martin
and
good
hope
nearing
nimule
illustration
hippo
camp
we
thought
it
was
much
too
late
to
attempt
any
serious
shooting
that
day
there
were
scarcely
three
and
a
half
hours
of
daylight
but
after
hours
cramped
on
these
little
boats
a
walk
through
jungle
was
very
attractive
and
accordingly
dividing
ourselves
into
three
parties
we
started
in
three
different
directions
like
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
captain
dickinson
who
commanded
the
escort
went
to
the
right
with
the
doctor
colonel
wilson
and
another
officer
set
out
at
right
angles
to
the
river
bank
and
i
went
to
the
left
under
the
guidance
of
our
friend
the
engineer
i
shall
relate
very
briefly
what
happened
to
each
of
us
the
party
got
after
an
walking
into
a
great
herd
of
elephants
which
they
numbered
at
over
sixty
they
saw
no
very
fine
bulls
they
found
themselves
surrounded
on
every
side
by
these
formidable
animals
and
the
wind
being
shifty
the
hour
late
and
the
morrow
free
they
judged
it
wise
to
return
to
camp
without
shooting
the
centre
party
consisting
of
colonel
wilson
and
his
companion
came
suddenly
after
about
a
mile
and
a
walk
upon
a
fine
solitary
bull
elephant
they
stalked
him
for
some
time
but
he
moved
off
and
on
perceiving
himself
followed
suddenly
without
the
slightest
warning
on
his
part
and
no
great
provocation
on
theirs
he
threw
up
his
trunk
trumpeted
and
charged
furiously
down
upon
them
whereupon
they
just
had
time
to
fire
their
rifles
in
his
face
and
spring
out
of
his
path
this
elephant
was
followed
for
some
miles
but
it
was
not
for
three
months
afterwards
that
we
learned
that
he
had
died
of
his
wounds
and
that
the
natives
had
recovered
his
tusks
so
much
for
my
friends
our
third
left
party
prowled
off
slanting
gradually
away
inland
from
the
river
bank
it
was
a
regular
wild
scrub
country
with
high
grass
and
boulders
and
many
trees
and
bushes
interspersed
every
hundred
yards
or
so
by
much
bigger
ones
near
the
nile
extensive
swamps
with
reeds
fifteen
feet
high
ran
inland
in
long
bays
and
fingers
and
these
we
were
told
were
the
haunts
of
white
rhino
we
must
have
walked
along
warily
and
laboriously
for
nearly
of
an
hour
when
i
saw
through
a
glade
at
about
two
hundred
yards
distance
a
great
dark
animal
judging
from
what
i
had
seen
in
east
africa
i
was
quite
sure
it
was
a
rhinoceros
we
paused
and
were
examining
it
carefully
with
our
glasses
when
all
of
a
sudden
it
seemed
to
treble
in
size
and
the
spreading
of
two
gigantic
ears
as
big
they
seemed
as
the
flaps
of
french
windows
proclaimed
the
presence
of
the
african
elephant
the
next
moment
another
and
another
and
another
came
into
view
swinging
leisurely
along
straight
towards
us
and
the
wind
was
almost
dead
wrong
we
changed
our
position
by
a
flank
march
of
admirable
celerity
and
from
the
top
of
a
neighbouring
hill
watched
at
the
distance
of
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
the
stately
and
procession
of
eleven
elephants
on
they
came
loafing
along
from
foot
to
foot
two
or
three
tuskers
of
no
great
merit
several
large
tuskless
females
and
two
or
three
calves
on
the
back
of
every
elephant
sat
at
least
one
beautiful
white
egret
and
sometimes
three
or
four
about
two
feet
high
who
pecked
at
the
tough
hide
i
presume
for
very
small
game
or
surveyed
the
scene
with
the
consciousness
of
pomp
these
sights
are
not
unusual
to
the
african
hunter
those
who
dwell
in
the
wilderness
are
the
heirs
of
its
wonders
but
to
me
i
confess
it
seemed
a
truly
marvellous
and
thrilling
experience
to
wander
through
a
forest
peopled
by
these
noble
titans
to
watch
their
mysterious
almost
ghostly
march
to
see
around
on
every
side
in
large
trees
snapped
off
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
in
enormous
branches
torn
down
for
sport
the
evidences
of
their
giant
strength
and
then
while
we
watched
them
roam
down
towards
the
water
i
heard
a
soft
swishing
sound
immediately
behind
us
and
turning
saw
not
forty
yards
away
a
splendid
rhinoceros
with
the
long
thin
horn
of
his
rare
tribe
upon
him
the
famous
white
rhinoceros
burchell
himself
strolling
placidly
home
after
his
evening
drink
and
utterly
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
stranger
or
foe
we
had
very
carefully
judged
our
wind
in
relation
to
the
elephants
it
was
in
consequence
absolutely
wrong
in
relation
to
the
rhinoceros
i
saw
that
in
another
fifty
yards
he
would
walk
right
across
it
for
my
own
part
perched
upon
the
apex
of
a
cone
i
need
have
no
misgivings
i
was
perfectly
safe
but
my
companions
and
the
native
orderlies
and
sailors
who
were
with
us
enjoyed
no
such
security
the
consequences
of
not
killing
the
brute
at
that
range
and
with
that
wind
would
have
been
a
mad
charge
directly
through
our
party
a
sense
of
responsibility
no
doubt
restrained
me
but
i
must
also
confess
to
the
most
complete
astonishment
at
the
unexpected
apparition
while
i
was
trying
to
hustle
the
others
by
signals
and
whispers
into
safer
places
the
rhino
moved
steadily
crossed
the
line
of
wind
stopped
behind
a
little
bush
for
a
moment
and
then
warned
of
his
danger
rushed
off
into
the
deepest
recesses
of
the
jungle
i
had
thrown
away
the
easiest
shot
i
ever
had
in
africa
meanwhile
the
elephants
had
disappeared
illustration
churchill
on
the
observation
ladder
at

camp
illustration
bank
of
the
victoria
nile
we
returned
with
empty
hands
and
beating
hearts
to
camp
not
without
chagrin
at
the
opportunity
which
had
vanished
but
with
the
keenest
appetite
and
the
highest
hopes
for
the
morrow
thus
in
three
hours
and
within
four
miles
of
our
our
three
separate
parties
had
seen
as
many
of
the
greatest
wild
animals
as
would
reward
the
whole
exertion
of
an
ordinary
hunt
as
i
dropped
off
to
sleep
that
night
in
the
little
moored
in
the
bay
and
heard
the
grunting
barks
of
the
hippo
floating
and
playing
all
around
mingling
with
the
cries
of
the
birds
and
the
soft
sounds
of
wind
and
water
the
african
forest
for
the
first
time
made
an
appeal
to
my
heart
enthralling
irresistible
never
to
be
forgotten
at
the
earliest
break
of
day
we
all
started
in
the
same
order
and
with
the
sternest
resolves
during
the
night
the
sailors
had
constructed
out
of
long
bamboo
poles
a
sort
of
light
tripod
which
serving
as
a
tower
of
observation
enabled
us
to
see
over
the
top
of
the
high
grass
and
reeds
and
this
proved
of
the
greatest
convenience
and
advantage
troublesome
though
it
was
to
drag
along
we
spent
the
whole
morning
prowling
about
but
the
jungle
which
twelve
hours
before
had
seemed
so
crowded
with
game
of
all
kinds
seemed
now
utterly
denuded
at
last
through
a
telescope
from
a
we
saw
or
thought
we
saw
four
or
five
elephants
or
big
animals
of
some
kind
grazing
about
two
miles
away
they
were
the
other
side
of
an
enormous
swamp
and
to
approach
them
required
not
only
traversing
this
but
circling
through
it
for
the
sake
of
the
wind
we
plunged
accordingly
into
this
vast
maze
of
reeds
following
the
twisting
paths
made
through
them
by
the
game
and
not
knowing
what
we
might
come
upon
at
every
step
the
ground
under
foot
was
quite
firm
between
the
channels
and
pools
of
mud
and
water
the
air
was
stifling
the
tall
reeds
and
grasses
seemed
to
smother
one
and
above
through
their
interlacement
shone
the
full
blaze
of
the
noonday
sun
to
wade
and
waddle
through
such
country
carrying
a
rifle
not
on
your
shoulder
but
in
your
hands
for
instant
service
peering
round
every
corner
suspecting
every
for
at
least
two
hours
is
not
so
pleasant
as
it
sounds
we
emerged
at
last
on
the
farther
side
under
a
glorious
tree
whose
height
had
made
it
our
beacon
in
the
depths
of
the
swamp
and
whose
branches
offered
a
delicious
shade
it
was
three
we
had
been
toiling
for
nine
hours
and
had
seen
nothing
literally
nothing
but
from
this
moment
our
luck
was
brilliant
first
we
watched
two
wild
boars
playing
at
fighting
in
a
little
glade
a
most
delightful
spectacle
which
i
enjoyed
for
two
or
three
minutes
before
they
discovered
us
and
fled
next
a
dozen
splendid
were
seen
browsing
on
the
crest
of
a
little
ridge
within
easy
shot
and
would
have
formed
the
quarry
of
any
day
but
this
but
our
ambition
soared
above
them
and
we
would
not
risk
disturbing
the
jungle
for
all
their
beautiful
horns
then
thirdly
we
came
slap
up
against
the
rhinoceros
how
many
i
am
not
certain
four
at
least
we
had
actually
walked
past
them
as
they
stood
sheltering
under
the
trees
now
here
they
were
sixty
yards
away
to
the
left
rear
dark
dim
sinister
bodies
just
visible
through
the
waving
grass
when
you
fire
a
heavy
rifle
in
cold
blood
it
makes
your
teeth
clatter
and
your
head
ache
at
such
a
moment
as
this
one
is
almost
unconscious
alike
of
report
and
recoil
it
might
be
a
the
nearest
rhino
was
broadside
on
i
hit
him
hard
with
both
barrels
and
down
he
went
to
rise
again
in
hideous
struggles

flourished
agonizingly
above

he
strove
to
advance
while
i
loaded
and
fired

that
was
all
i
saw
myself
two
other
rhinos
escaped
over
the
hill
and
a
fourth
running
the
other
way
charged
the
native
sailors
carrying
our
observation
tower
who
were
very
glad
to
drop
it
and
scatter
in
all
directions
illustration

white
rhinoceros
to
shoot
a
good
specimen
of
the
white
rhinoceros
is
an
event
sufficiently
important
in
the
life
of
a
sportsman
to
make
the
day
on
which
it
happens
bright
and
memorable
in
his
calendar
but
more
excitement
was
in
store
for
us
before
the
night
about
a
mile
from
the
spot
where
our
victim
lay
we
stopped
to
rest
and
rejoice
and
not
least
refresh
the
tower
of
observation
which
had
been
dragged
so
painfully
along
all
day
was
set
up
and
climbing
it
i
saw
at
once
on
the
edge
of
the
swamp
no
fewer
than
four
more
rhinoceros
scarcely
four
hundred
yards
away
a
tall
within
easy
range
gave
us
cover
to
stalk
them
and
the
wind
was
exactly
right
but
the
reader
has
dallied
long
enough
in
this
paradise
it
is
enough
to
say
that
we
killed
two
more
of
these
monsters
while
one
escaped
into
the
swamp
and
the
fourth
charged
wildly
down
upon
us
and
galloped
through
our
party
without
apparently
being
touched
himself
or
injuring
any
one
then
marking
the
places
where
the
carcasses
lay
we
returned
homeward
through
the
swamp
too
triumphant
and
too
tired
to
worry
about
the
enraged
fugitives
who
lurked
in
its
recesses
it
was
very
late
when
we
reached
home
and
our
friends
had
already
hewn
the
tusks
out
of
a
good
elephant
which
colonel
wilson
had
shot
and
were
roasting
a
buck
which
had
conveniently
replenished

chapter
x
down
the
white
nile
we
lingered
lovingly
around
hippo
camp
for
two
more
days
moving
to
other
lagoons
and
overflows
of
the
river
with
the
launch
and
striking
out
inland
in
search
of
the
great
herd
of
elephants
but
although
their
recent
presence
was
on
all
sides
proclaimed
by
trees
and
trampled
ground
and
broad
lanes
cut
through
the
grass
we
saw
none
of
them
and
a
tribe
of
natives
who
helped
to
carry
home
a
variety
of
buck
one
afternoon
informed
us
upon
expert
authority
that
the
whole
herd
had
been
alarmed
by
the
arrival
of
strangers
and
the
sound
of
firing
and
had
retired
three
days
journey
from
the
bank
these
natives
of
the
lado
enclave
were
folk
and
i
parleyed
long
with
them
upon
their
affairs
they
were
stark
naked
and
very
dignified
with
graceful
athletic
bodies
long
tapering
hands
and
bright
keen
eyes
the
local
chief
exhibited
all
these
characteristics
in
a
superior
degree
and
his
natural
preeminence
was
recognized
with
instantaneous
obedience
by
his
followers
we
loaded
them
with
gifts
first
quantities
of
meat
and
hides
then
chocolate
all
round
they
love
sweet
things
three
pieces
of
sugar
for
each
at
least
one
empty
bottle
per
man
and
tin
pots
and
boxes
almost
without
limit
the
chief
showed
a
fine
taste
in
all
these
things
and
annexed
at
once
in
the
imperial
style
whatever
took
his
fancy
to
whomsoever
it
belonged
i
cast
about
for
some
means
of
doing
him
especial
honour
and
luckily
remembered
that
i
had
bought
a
japanese
for
a
in
passing
through
port
said
on
the
journey
out
with
this
he
was
forthwith
enrobed
and
i
must
say
he
assumed
the
flowing
garment
with
that
easy
grace
and
natural
which
are
the
gifts
of
a
wilderness
life
thus
the
fabrics
of
cathay
were
by
the
enterprise
of
europe
introduced
into
the
heart
of
africa
when
finally
with
much
reluctance
we
left
this
attractive
place
and
pushed
off
determinedly
into
the
stream
we
lost
no
time
in
making
nimule
steaming
throughout
the
night
and
all
next
day
along
a
broad
flood
contained
by
high
and
healthy
slopes
now
clothed
with
forest
now
with
waving
grass
we
approached
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
the
mountains
beneath
which
is
the
administrative
station
of
nimule
hitherto
the
course
of
the
nile
since
it
left
the
albert
lake
had
been
smooth
and
open
a
broad
river
everywhere
navigable
to
vessels
of
not
more
than
four
feet
draught
but
at
nimule
after
a
reach
of
more
than
a
hundred
and
seventy
miles
of
unobstructed
waterway
the
river
turns
a
sharp
right
angle
and
enters
a
long
succession
of
granite
gorges
through
which
it
plunges
in
ceaseless
cataract
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
it
is
here
at
the
head
of
these
rapids
that
one
of
the
great
reservoirs
of
the
upper
nile
must
some
day
be
constructed
i
spent
hours
said
sir
william
willcocks
the
practical
mystic
of
hydraulic
engineering
looking
at
the
site
and
seeing
in
a
vision
a
great
regulating
work
of
the
future
and
indeed
the
exact
scientific
control
of
the
whole
vast
system
of
central
african
waters
of
the
levels
of
every
lake
of
the
flow
of
every
channel
from
month
to
month
and
from
day
to
day
throughout
the
year
is
a
need
so
obvious
and
undisputed
as
to
leave
argument
unemployed
the
change
in
the
character
of
the
river
separated
us
finally
from
our
flotilla
from
nimule
to
gondokoro
we
must
again
proceed
by
land
and
the
swift
and
easy
progress
of
the
last
few
days
must
be
exchanged
for
the
steady
grind
of
marches
it
was
this
stage
which
had
always
been
painted
to
me
as
the
most
dangerous
and
unhealthy
in
our
whole
journey
and
i
had
pictured
to
myself
eight
days
of
toil
through
swamp
and
forest
amid
miasma
and
mosquitoes
these
anticipations
were
not
sustained
of
the
disadvantages
of
the
track
along
the
river
bank
i
can
not
speak
but
the
upper
road
over
the
hills
is
certainly
excellent
and
healthy
and
runs
throughout
over
firm
dry
undulations
of
a
bright
breezy
country
at
nimule
we
touched
the
telegraph
wire
again
and
from
the
accumulations
which
i
studied
i
learned
that
parliament
would
not
meet
till
the
of
january
this
gave
another
ten
days
more
rope
and
i
began
to
realize
how
much
the
spirit
of
these
wonderful
lands
had
taken
possession
of
me
for
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
reluctance
and
difficulty
that
i
forced
myself
to
continue
my
homeward
journey
without
first
turning
back
with
the
launch
and
circumnavigating
lake
albert
no
exertion
or
inconvenience
seemed
too
great
to
win
a
few
more
glimpses
of
these
enchanted
seas
and
gardens
on
which
i
may
perhaps
not
look
again
but
from
whose
spell
i
can
never
be
free
porters
to
be
fed
from
day
to
day
the
sirdar
steamer
waiting
at
the
soudan
frontier
public
meetings
looming
heavily
in
the
distance
drove
me
onward
and
with
feelings
of
keen
and
genuine
regret
we
addressed
ourselves
to
the
march
to
gondokoro
illustration
fording
the
asua
this
was
accomplished
uneventfully
in
six
stages
three
of
which
were
double
marches
the
country
was
pleasant
and
healthy
the
scenery
imposing
and
under
a
fierce
sun
the
air
was
cool
each
morning
we
started
before
dawn
and
by
noon
had
camped
by
the
side
of
one
of
the
tributary
rivers
or
streams
which
flow
into
the
nile
of
these
the
asua
was
the
most
important
and
the
picture
of
the
long
fording
it
and
coming
into
camp
among
the
of
the
southern
bank
is
one
which
lingers
pleasantly
in
my
memory
but
this
i
must
say
somehow
after
nimule
the
charm
was
broken
and
none
of
the
regions
through
which
the
traveller
passes
in
the
descent
of
the
nile
revive
in
any
degree
those
delicious
sensations
of
wonder
and
novelty
which
are
associated
with
the
great
lakes
and
the
kingdoms
of
uganda
usoga
and
unyoro
to
say
nothing
of
what
i
have
not
been
fortunate
enough
to
see
toro
ankole
the
semliki
and
the
mountains
of
the
moon
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
day
we
arrived
at
gondokoro
the
last
march
had
been
long
and
scorching
the
moisture
seemed
to
have
gone
from
the
air
and
the
vegetation
abundant
though
it
was
seemed
parched
and
stunted
the
approaches
to
gondokoro
are
beset
by
a
herd
of
three
hundred
elephants
of
peculiar
nearly
all
the
eligible
tuskers
have
been
killed
the
females
and
young
bulls

and
wary
and

by
frequent
contact
with
the
white
man

by
the

a
lawless
and
tyrannical
power
over

whole

side

are
to
be
seen
great
trees
pushed
over
in
careless
sport
native
plantations
trampled
into
ruin
the
roads
rendered
precarious
for
the
traveller
the
mails
often
interrupted
for
days
at
a
time
and
occasional
loss
of
life
are
the
features
of
this
domination
and
it
seems
likely
to
last
a
long
time
for
i
was
informed
that
the
young
bulls
would
not
be
sufficiently
grown
for
about
forty
years
and
even
then
as
the
two
white
officers
in
the
station
are
not
allowed
to
shoot
more
than
one
elephant
apiece
each
year
the
nuisance
will
only
gradually
be
abated
rogue
elephants
are
of
course
fair
game
at
any
time
and
the
day
before
we
arrived
at
gondokoro
the
young
civil
officer
of
the
station
had
encountered
one
in
a
manner
which
he
was
scarcely
likely
to
forget
for
having
pursued
this
for
some
time
he
at
last
got
into
an
excellent
position
and
was
about
to
fire
at
a
distance
of
thirty
yards
when
suddenly
the
elephant
without
even
trumpeting
rushed
furiously
upon
him
and
paying
no
attention
to
the
two
heavy
bullets
which
struck
him
in
the
head
chased
the
officer
twice
round
an
uncommonly
small
bush
and
then
distracted
by
the
spectacle
of
the
native
in
flight
turned
off
after
this
new
prey
and
overtaking
the
poor
wretch
smashed
him
to
pieces
with
one
blow
of
his
terrible
trunk

reached
the

had

an

ten

this

a

nothing

away
and
these

of
the

now

were
silent
in
the
embrace
of
a

by

were
fortunate
in
securing
a

we
wandered
through
a
harsh
country
of
white
sand
and
tussocks
of
coarse
grass
more
grey

with

black
densely

it
seemed
full
of
game
in

walk
on

i
shot
a

waterbuck
two
and
two
of
a
beautiful
herd
of
roan
antelope
who
walked
slowly
down
to

past
our
ambuscade
and
be
it
remembered
that
the
pleasure
and
excitement
of
such
sport
are
in
these
lands
always
heightened
by
the
possibility
that
at
any
moment
the
hunters
may
come
upon
game
of
much
more
serious
quality

that
no

cares
to
be
more
than
a
few
yards
from
his
heavy
rifle
or
give
his
mind
wholly
to
the
buck
he
stalks
surely
they
are
perverse
unenterprising
folk
who
spend
fortunes
each
year
in
preserving
with
so
much
artificial
care
and
to
the
inconvenience
of
other

in

small

in

could
pursue
wild
animals
of
every
kind
in
their
natural
haunts

gain
experiences
that
would
last
them
all
their
lives
i
was
so
much
elated
by
this
jolly
morning
sport
and
the
near
approach
of
civilized
conditions
for
after
all
contrast
is
an
element
in
pleasure
that
i
permitted
myself
to
rejoice
at
the
safe

happy
outcome
of
this
long
journey

to
exult
in
our
complete
immunity

accident

extravagant

come

so
much
blood
has

i
found
myself
standing

chapter
xi
the
victoria
and
albert
railway
my
journey
is
at
an
end
the
tale
is
told
and
the
reader
who
has
followed
so
faithfully
and
so
far
has
a
right
to
ask
what
message
i
bring
back
it
can
be
stated
in
three
words
concentrate
upon
uganda
over
the
greater
part
of
the
quarter
of
africa
british
influence
or
authority
in
one
form
or
another
is
supreme
but
when
i
turn
my
mind
over
all
those
vast
expanses
excluding
only
egypt
there
is
no
region
which
offers
prospects
to
compare
in
hopefulness
with
those
of
the
protectorate
of
uganda
the
soudan
is
far
greater
in
extent
and
importance
and
great
britain
is
at
no
charge
in
respect
to
it
but
the
soudan
is
clearly
inferior
in
fertility
the
east
african
protectorate
possesses
not
only
enormous
of
great
value
but
noble
plateaux
where
the
air
is
as
cool
as
an
english
spring
but
we
already
spend
on
east
africa
and
upon
the
needs
of
its
expensive
white
settlers
more
than
the
whole
revenue
of
uganda
and
yet
the
promise
is
not
so
bright
northern
somaliland
is
a
desert
of
rocks
and
thorn
bushes
peopled
by
fanatics
on
which
we
spend
nearly
half
as
much
as
the
whole
annual
of
uganda
and
between
somaliland
and
uganda
there
is
this
contrast
presented
in
its
crudest
form
a
barren
land
with
dangerous
inhabitants
and
a
fruitful
land
with
a
docile
people
what
is
least
worth
having
is
most
difficult
to
hold
what
is
most
worth
having
is
easiest
the
union
under
scientific
direction
in
uganda
and
i
include
in
this
popular
name
usoga
unyoro
toro
and
ankole
etc
of
unequalled
fertility
with
a
population
of
high
intelligence
and
social
quality
in
a
region
of
extraordinary
waterways
must
unless
some
grievous
error
or
neglect
should
intervene
result
in
remarkable
economic
developments
already
more
than
half
the
traffic
which
passes
down
the
railway
to
mombasa
comes
from
beyond
the
lake
yet
scarcely
any
money
has
ever
been
spent
on
uganda
no
european
roads
exist
no
railways
have
been
built
no
waterfalls
are
harnessed
no
public
works
of
any
serious
description
have
been
undertaken
a
poor
little
has
barely
supported
the
cost
of
european
administration
and
practically
nothing
in
cash
or
credit
has
been
available
for
the
development
of
the
country
but
it
is
alive
by
itself
it
is
vital
and
in
my
view
in
spite
of
its
insects
and
its
diseases
it
ought
in
the
course
of
time
to
become
the
most
prosperous
of
all
our
east
and
central
african
possessions
and
perhaps
the
financial
driving
wheel
of
all
this
part
of
the
world
it
is
far
from
my
desire
to
disparage
the
east
african
protectorate
or
to
suggest
diminution
of
activity
or
support
both
protectorates
are
necessary
to
each
other
and
should
advance
together
but
in
view
of
their
relative
positions
and
looking
at
the
situation
as
it
is
my
counsel
plainly
is
concentrate
upon
uganda
nowhere
else
in
africa
will
a
little
money
go
so
far
nowhere
else
will
the
results
be
more
brilliant
more
substantial
or
more
rapidly
realized
cotton
alone
should
make
the
fortune
of
uganda
all
the
best
qualities
of
cotton
can
be
grown
in
the
highest
perfection
a
hundred
thousand
intelligent
landowners
occupying
twenty
thousand
square
miles
of
suitable
soil
are
eager
to
engage
in
the
cultivation
an
industrious
and
organized
population
offers
the
necessary
labour
merely
at
the
request
of
the
government
cotton
has
been
planted
experimentally
on
a
considerable
scale
throughout
uganda
the
figures
of
production
though
of
course
they
are
only
the
first
beginnings
show
a
surprising
expansion
great
care
is
required
and
steps
have
already
been
taken
to
secure
that
the
quality
of
cotton
exported
from
uganda
is
not
deteriorated
or
its
reputation
prejudiced
by
hasty
or
untutored
action
that
only
the
seeds
which
yield
the
best
results
should
be
distributed
and
that
no
indiscriminate
mixture
should
be
permitted
the
government
must
control
the
culture
experts
must
watch
the
ginneries
and
educate
the
native
cultivator
roads
must
be
made
to
enable
the
crop
to
be
marketed
the
scientific
organization
of
the
resources
of
uganda
has
now
been
definitely
undertaken
a
special
grant
of
a
year
will
in
future
be
devoted
to
this
purpose
and
the
whole
process
will
be
supervised
by
european
officers
in
close
touch
through
the
colonial
office
with
the
highest
manchester
authorities
and
the
british
association
in
the
opinion
of
the
ablest
observers
the
next
five
years
will
see
a
very
remarkable
development
in
cotton
production
even
though
the
means
available
to
foster
it
continue
to
be
slender
but
cotton
is
only
one
of
those
tropical
products
for
which
the
demand
of
civilized
industry
is
almost
insatiable
and
which
can
nowhere
in
the
world
be
grown
more
cheaply
more
easily
more
perfectly
than
between
the
waters
of
the
two
great
lakes
rubber
fibre
cinnamon
cocoa
coffee
sugar
may
all
be
cultivated
upon
the
greatest
scale
virgin
forests
of
rare
and
valuable
timber
await
the
axe
and
even
though
mineral
wealth
may
perhaps
never
lend
its
hectic
glory
to
uganda
the
economic
foundations
of
its
prosperity
will
stand
securely
upon
a
rich
and
varied
agriculture
a
settler
country
it
can
never
be
whatever
may
be
the
destinies
of
the
east
african
highlands
the
shores
of
the
great
lakes
will
never
be
the
permanent
residence
of
a
white
race
it
is
a
planter
land
where
the
labours
of
the
native
population
may
be
organized
and
directed
by
superior
intelligence
and
external
capital
for
my
own
part
i
rejoice
that
the
physical
conditions
of
the
country
are
such
as
to
prevent
the
growth
in
the
heart
of
happy
uganda
of
a
petty
white
community
with
the
harsh
and
selfish
ideas
which
mark
the
jealous
contact
of
races
and
the
exploitation
of
the
weaker
let
it
remain
a
planter
land
let
the
planters
instead
of
being
the
agents
of
excited
syndicates
with
minds
absorbed
in
the
profits
of
shareholders
thousands
of
miles
away
be
either
europeans
of
substance
and
character
who
have
given
proofs
of
their
knowledge
of
natives
and
their
ability
to
deal
skilfully
and
justly
with
them
or
better
still
say
i
let
them
be
the
disinterested
officers
of
the
government
directing
the
development
of
the
country
neither
in
their
own
nor
any
other
pecuniary
interest
but
for
the
general
good
of
its
people
and
of
the
empire
of
which
it
forms
a
part
but
if
the
immediate
inflexion
of
british
policy
in
eastern
africa
should
be
without
prejudice
but
with
precedence
of
other
provinces
to
accelerate
the
economic
and
social
development
of
uganda
what
are
the
first
steps
to
take
i
might
have
much
to
say
of
forestry
and
agriculture
of
an
extended
system
of
technical
education
similar
to
that
given
at
the
gordon
college
at
khartoum
here
perhaps
in
part
to
be
achieved
through
grants
in
aid
of
the
existing
missionary
schools
of
indispensable
to
progress
of
and
of
but
let
me
make
my
message
brief
and
unclouded
and
as
before
expressed
in
three
words
build
a
railway
the
clusters
of
colonial
possessions
which
have
been
acquired
on
the
east
and
west
coasts
of
africa
so
rapidly
and
with
so
little
cost
or
bloodshed
will
unquestionably
prove
an
invaluable
if
not
indeed
a
necessary
feature
of
the
british
empire
from
these
vast
plantations
will
be
drawn
the
raw
materials
of
many
of
our
most
important
industries
to
them
will
flow
a
continuous
and
broadening
train
of
british
products
and
in
them
the
peculiar
gifts
for
administration
and
high
civic
virtues
of
our
race
may
find
a
healthy
and
an
honourable
scope
some
of
these
great
estates
like
southern
nigeria
on
the
west
coast
are
already
so
prosperous
as
not
only
to
be
but
able
to
assist
with
credit
and
subvention
the
progress
of
neighbours
less
far
advanced
others
are
still
a
charge
upon
our
estimates
we
are
annually
put
to
the
expense
of
more
or
less
considerable
for
northern
somaliland
the
east
african
protectorate
nyassaland
and
uganda
heavy
upon
the
finance
of
all
the
east
coast
hangs
the
capital
charge
of
the
uganda
railway
in
no
way
will
these
charges
be
eased
or
removed
except
by
the
rise
of
one
or
more
of
the
territories
concerned
to
economic
buoyancy
or
by
the
growth
of
railway
traffic
down
the
uganda
trunk
consequent
upon
development
under
present
conditions
the
progress
made
from
year
to
year
is
steady
and
encouraging
the
charges
upon
the
colonial
estimates
diminish
regularly
every
year
every
year
the
administration
of
the
different
governments
increases
in
elaboration
in
efficiency
and
consequently
in
cost
the
extra
charge
is
met
ever
more
fully
by
the
returning
yield
of
a
grateful
soil
except
for
the
chances
of
war
rebellion
pestilence
and
famine
which
brood
over
the
infancy
of
tropical
protectorates
but
which
may
be
averted
or
controlled
it
would
be
easy
to
calculate
a
date
not
too
remote
by
which
all
contribution
from
the
british
would
be
unnecessary
the
movement
of
events
is
encouraging
but
there
is
one
method
by
which
it
can
be
made
far
more
sure
and
far
more
swift
by
which
all
adverse
chances
are
minimized
and
all
existing
resources
stimulated
and
multiplied
railways
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
is
only
wasting
time
and
money
to
try
to
govern
or
still
more
develop
a
great
african
possession
without
a
railway
there
can
be
no
security
progress
or
prosperity
without
at
least
one
central
line
of
rapid
communication
driven
through
the
heart
of
the
country
where
as
in
northern
somaliland
the
land
itself
is
utterly
valueless
a
mere
desert
of
rocks
and
scrub
or
where
the
military
dangers
are
excessive
and
utterly
disproportioned
to
any
results
that
can
ever
be
reaped
withdrawal
and
concentration
are
the
true
policy
but
if
for
any
reason
it
be
decided
to
remain
and
to
administer
a
railway
becomes
the
prime
of
absolute
necessities
till
then
all
civilized
government
is
extravagant
and
precarious
and
all
profitable
commerce
practically
impossible
these
considerations
have
lately
led
a
british
government
to
sanction
the
extensive
railways
nearly
miles
long
now
being
rapidly
constructed
in
northern
and
southern
nigeria
and
the
same
arguments
apply
though
in
my
view
with
increased
force
to
the
uganda
protectorate
it
is
not
usually
realized
that
the
uganda
railway
does
not
pass
through
uganda
it
is
the
railway
uganda
and
not
uganda
it
stops
short
of
the
land
from
which
it
takes
its
name
and
falls
exhausted
by
its
exertions
and
vicissitudes
content
feverishly
to
lap
the
waters
of
the
victoria
nyanza
uganda
is
reached
but
not
traversed
by
steam
communication
in
any
form
yet
the
extension
of
the
railway
from
the
western
shores
of
the
victoria
to
the
albert
nyanza
would
not
only
carry
it
through
much
of
the
most
valuable
and
fertile
country
within
its
radius
but
as
i
shall
show
could
far
more
than
double
its
effective
scope
it
may
be
accepted
as
an
axiom
that
in
the
present
state
of
development
in
these
african
protectorates
it
is
scarcely
ever
and
indeed
i
think
never
worth
while
to
build
railways
in
competition
with
waterways
railways
should
in
new
countries
be
in
supplement
of
and
not
in
substitution
for
lakes
and
navigable
rivers
no
doubt
direct
of
railway
where
bulk
is
not
broken
and
all
delays
and
changings
are
avoided
show
an
imposing
advantage
in
comparison
with
a
mere
alternation
of
water
stages
and
railway
links
there
could
be
no
doubt
which
was
the
better
if
only
you
leave
out
the
question
of
cost
but
it
is
just
this
question
of
cost
which
can
not
be
left
out
which
clamorously
dominates
the
proposition
from
the
beginning
for
countries
may
afford
railways
and
de
but
countries
must
be
less
ambitious
and
young
new
countries
are
satisfied
or
ought
to
be
if
they
get
any
railway
at
all
the
differences
between
the
best
railway
in
the
world
and
the
worst
are
no
doubt
impressive
but
they
become
utterly
insignificant
when
contrasted
with
the
difference
between
the
worst
railway
in
the
world
and
no
railway
at
all
for
observe
the
comparison
is
not
with
perfect
lines
of
european
communication
nor
with
anything
like
them
nor
even
with
a
waggon
on
a
turnpike
road
it
is
with
a
jogging
grunting
panting
failing
line
of
tottering
coolies
men
reduced
to
beasts
of
burden
that
the
new
pioneer
line
must
be
compared
that
is
to
say
with
the
most
painful
most
degrading
slowest
and
feeblest
method
of
transportation
which
has
ever
disgraced
the
world
and
compared
with
that
any
line
of
however
primitive
however
light
however
interrupted
is
heaven
i
am
endeavouring
to
guide
the
reader
to
a
positive
proposal
of
a
modest
and
practical
character
i
mean
the
construction
of
a
new
railway
which
might
be
called
the
victoria
and
albert
railway
although
it
would
virtually
be
an
extension
of
the
existing
uganda
line
this
railway
should
traverse
the
country
between
the
great
lakes
and
join
together
these
two
noble
reservoirs
with
all
their
respective
river
connections
the
distance
is
not
great
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
would
exceed
the
largest
computation
and
perhaps
a
line
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
would
suffice
if
the
cost
of
this
railway
were
estimated
as
i
am
informed
is
reasonable
at
a
maximum
figure
of
a
mile
the
total
sum
involved
would
be
between
and
the
supreme
advantage
of
making
a
railway
debouch
upon
a
great
lake
is
that
every
point
on
the
lake
shore
is
instantly
put
in
almost
equal
communication
with
railhead
steamers
coast
round
on
circular
tours
and
whatsoever
trade
or
traffic
may
offer
along
the
whole
circumference
is
carried
swiftly
to
the
railway
lakes
are
in
fact
the
catchment
areas
of
trade
and
it
is
by
tapping
and
uniting
them
that
the
economic
life
of
central
africa
can
be
most
easily
and
swiftly
stimulated
two
routes
present
themselves
with
various
competing
advantages
by
which
the
victoria
and
albert
railway
may
proceed
the
first
the
most
obvious
most
desirable
and
most
expensive
is
straight
across
the
highlands
of
toro
through
the
best
of
the
cotton
country
from
a
point
on
the
victoria
lake
in
the
neighbourhood
of
entebbe
to
where
the
semliki
river
runs
into
the
southern
end
of
lake
albert
the
second
would
practically
follow
the
footsteps
recorded
in
these
pages
it
does
not
offer
a
direct
line
it
does
not
pass
during
the
whole
of
its
length
through
cultivated
and
inhabited
country
it
does
not
reach
the
albert
lake
at
the
most
convenient
end
but
it
is
far
cheaper
than
the
other
it
is
only
miles
long
instead
of
nearly
it
connects
not
only
the
two
great
lakes
but
also
lake
chioga
with
all
its
channels
and
tributaries
in
one
system
of
unbroken
steam
communication
briefly
this
latter
project
would
consist
of
two
links
of
railway
the
first
about
sixty
miles
long
from
jinja
or
ripon
falls
to
kakindu
the
first
point
where
the
victoria
nile
becomes
navigable
the
second
about
miles
long
from
the
neighbourhood
of
mruli
to
the
nile
below
the
murchison
falls
and
near
its
mouth
on
the
albert
by
these
two
sections
of
railway
together
only
miles
in
length
a
wonderful
extent
of
waterways
would
be
commanded
to
wit
thirty
miles
of
the
victoria
nile
navigable
from
kakindu
to
lake
chioga
lake
chioga
itself
with
its
long
arms
and
gulfs
stretching
deeply
into
the
whole
of
the
fertile
regions
to
the
of
mount
elgon
and
affording
a
perimeter
of
navigable
coastline
accessible
by
steamers
of
certainly
not
less
than
miles
all
that
reach
of
the
victoria
nile
navigable
from
lake
chioga
to
foweira
when
the
rapids
ending
in
the
murchison
falls
begin
again
miles
thirty
miles
from
below
the
falls
to
the
albert
lake
the
whole
of
the
albert
lake
shores
miles
the
semliki
river
navigable
once
a
sandbar
has
been
passed
for
sixty
miles
the
glorious
open
reach
of
the
white
nile
from
the
albert
lake
to
nimule
miles
thus
by
the
construction
of
only
miles
of
railroad
swift
modern
communication
would
be
established
over
a
total
range
of
miles
or
for
an
addition
of
to
its
length
and
to
its
cost
the
effective
radius
of
the
uganda
railway
would
be
more
than
doubled
such
railway
propositions
are
few
and
far
between
i
do
not
prejudge
the
choice
of
these
two
routes
both
are
now
being
carefully
surveyed
the
advantages
of
the
longer
and
more
ambitious
line
across
toro
are
perhaps
superior
but
the
cost
is
also
nearly
twice
as
great
and
cost
is
a
vital
factor
not
merely
to
the
government
called
upon
to
find
money
but
still
more
to
the
commercial
soundness
of
an
enterprise
which
is
permanently
crippled
if
its
original
capital
charges
are
allowed
notably
to
exceed
what
the
estimated
earnings
would
sustain
the
question
is
one
which
will
require
severe
and
patient
examination
the
nicest
balancings
between
competitive
advantages
the
smoothest
compromises
between
the
practical
and
the
ideal
but
let
us
now
look
forward
to
a
time
not
i
trust
remote
when
by
one
route
or
the
other
the
distance
between
the
victoria
and
albert
lakes
has
been
spanned
by
a
railway
and
when
the
mountains
of
the
moon
are
scarcely
four
days
journey
from
mombasa
the
british
government
will
then
be
possessed
of
the
shortest
route
to
the
eastern
congo
the
uganda
railway
will
be
able
to
offer
rates
for
merchandise
and
railway
material
with
which
no
other
line
that
can
ever
be
constructed
will
ever
be
able
to
compete
the
whole
of
that
already
considerable
though
as
yet
stifled
trade
which
feebly
trickles
back
half
across
africa
by
boma
to
the
atlantic
which
is
looking
desperately
for
an
outlet
to
the
northward
which
percolates
in
driblets
through
uganda
will
flow
swiftly
and
abundantly
to
the
benefit
of
all
parties
concerned
down
the
uganda
trunk
raising
that
line
with
steady
impulse
from
the
of
a
political
railway
towards
the
level
of
a
sound
commercial
enterprise
in
no
other
way
will
the
british
recover
his
capital
the
advantages
are
great
and
the
expense
moderate
larger
considerations
may
postpone
and
the
imperative
need
of
the
fullest
surveys
will
in
any
case
delay
construction
but
i
can
not
doubt
that
the
victoria
and
albert
railway
is
now
the
most
important
project
awaiting
action
in
the
whole
of
that
group
of
protectorates
which
sir
frederick
lugard
used
proudly
to
call
our
east
african
empire
but
let
us
proceed
one
step
further
in
the
development
of
the
communications
of
africa
when
an
extension
of
the
uganda
railway
has
reached
the
albert
nyanza
only
one
link
will
be
missing
to
connect
the
whole
of
the
rail
and
waterway
system
of
east
africa
and
uganda
with
the
enormous
system
of
railways
and
riverways
of
egypt
and
the
soudan
to
connect
the
uganda
with
the
desert
railway
to
join
the
navigation
of
the
great
lakes
to
the
navigation
of
the
blue
and
white
niles
only
one
link
will
be
missing
and
that
a
very
short
one
the
distance
of
miles
from
nimule
to
gondokoro
where
the
nile
is
interrupted
by
cataracts
of
the
commercial
utility
of
such
a
link
i
have
nothing
to
say
but
as
a
means
of
marrying
two
gigantic
systems
of
steam
communication
it
will
some
day
possess
a
high
importance
and
thereafter
over
the
whole
of
the
quarter
of
the
african
continent
under
the
influence
or
authority
of
the
british
crown
comprising
a
total
mileage
by
rail
and
river
of
perhaps
miles
uninterrupted
steam
communication
will
prevail
the
adventurous
and
the
imaginative
may
peer
out
beyond
these
compact
and
practicable
steps
into
a
more
remote
and
speculative
region
perhaps
by
the
time
that
the
junction
between
the
uganda
and
soudan
rail
and
water
systems
has
been
effected
the
rhodes
cape
to
cairo
railway
will
have
reached
the
southern
end
of
lake
tanganyika
and
then
only
one
comparatively
short
hiatus
will
bar
a
complete
transcontinental
line
if
not
wholly
of
railroad
at
least
of
steam
traffic
and
of
comfortable
and
speedy
travel
then
perhaps
it
will
be
time
to
make
another
journey
but
as
the
reader
who
will
no
doubt
take
care
to
secure
a
tourist
ticket

no
longer
require
