chapter
i
the
lone
passenger
that
evening
the
down
train
from
london
deposited
at
the
little
country
station
of
ramsdon
but
a
single
passenger
a
man
of
middle
height
shabbily
dressed
with
broad
shoulders
and
long
arms
and
a
most
unusual
breadth
and
depth
of
chest
of
his
face
one
could
see
little
for
it
was
covered
by
a
thick
growth
of
dark
curly
hair
beard
moustache
and
whiskers
all
overgrown
and
and
as
he
came
with
a
somewhat
slow
and
ungainly
walk
along
the
platform
the
lad
stationed
at
the
gate
to
collect
tickets
grinned
amusedly
and
called
to
one
of
the
porters
near
look
at
this
bill
here
the
escaped
and
come
back
along
of
it
was
a
reference
to
a
travelling
circus
that
had
lately
visited
the
place
and
exhibited
a
young
chimpanzee
advertised
as
the
and
bill
guffawed
appreciatively
the
stranger
was
quite
close
and
heard
plainly
for
indeed
the
youth
at
the
gate
had
made
no
special
attempt
to
speak
softly
the
boy
was
still
laughing
as
he
held
out
his
hand
for
the
ticket
and
the
stranger
gave
it
to
him
with
one
hand
and
at
the
same
time
shot
out
a
long
arm
caught
the
boy
a
lad
of
sixteen
by
the
middle
and
with
as
little
apparent
effort
as
though
lifting
a
baby
swung
him
into
the
air
to
the
top
of
the
where
he
left
him
clinging
with
arms
and
legs
six
feet
from
the
ground
hi
what
are
you
of
shouted
the
porter
running
up
as
the
amazed
and
frightened
youth
clinging
to
his
emitted
a
dismal
howl
teaching
a
cheeky
boy
manners
retorted
the
stranger
with
an
angry
look
and
in
a
very
gruff
and
harsh
voice
do
you
want
to
go
on
top
of
the
other
post
to
make
a
pair
the
porter
drew
back
hurriedly
you
be
off
he
ordered
as
he
retreated
we
do
want
none
of
your
sort
about
i
certainly
have
no
intention
of
staying
retorted
the
other
as
gruffly
as
before
but
i
think
you
remember
bobbie
dunn
next
time
i
come
this
let
me
down
please
let
me
down
wailed
the
boy
clinging
desperately
to
the
on
whose
top
he
had
been
so
unceremoniously
deposited
and
dunn
laughed
and
walked
away
leaving
the
porter
to
rescue
his
youthful
colleague
and
to
cuff
his
ears
soundly
as
soon
as
he
had
done
so
by
way
of
a
relief
to
his
feelings
that
will
learn
you
to
be
a
bit
civil
to
folk
i
hope
said
the
porter
severely
but
that
there
chap
must
have
an
amazing
strong
arm
he
added
thoughtfully
lifting
you
up
there
all
the
same
as
you
was
a
bunch
of
for
some
distance
after
leaving
the
station
dunn
walked
on
slowly
he
seemed
to
know
the
way
well
or
else
to
be
careless
of
the
direction
he
took
for
he
walked
along
deep
in
thought
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
and
not
looking
in
the
least
where
he
was
going
abruptly
a
small
child
appeared
out
of
the
darkness
and
spoke
to
him
and
he
started
violently
and
in
a
very
nervous
manner
what
was
that
what
did
you
say
kiddy
he
asked
recovering
himself
instantly
and
speaking
this
time
not
in
the
gruff
and
harsh
tones
he
had
used
before
but
in
a
singularly
winning
and
pleasant
voice
cultivated
and
gentle
that
was
in
odd
contrast
with
his
rough
and
battered
appearance
the
time
was
that
what
you
wanted
to
know
yes
sir
please
sir
answered
the
child
who
had
shrunk
back
in
alarm
at
the
violent
start
dunn
had
given
but
now
seemed
reassured
by
his
gentle
and
pleasant
voice
the
right
time
the
little
one
added
almost
instantly
and
with
much
emphasis
on
the
dunn
gravely
gave
the
required
information
with
the
assurance
that
to
the
best
of
his
belief
it
was
right
and
the
child
thanked
him
and
scampered
off
resuming
his
way
dunn
shook
his
head
with
an
air
of
grave
dissatisfaction
nerves
all
to
pieces
he
muttered
that
wo
do
hang
it
all
the
job
no
worse
than
following
a
wounded
tiger
into
the
jungle
and
done
that
before
now
only
then
of
course
one
knew
what
to
expect
whereas
now
and
i
was
a
silly
ass
to
lose
my
temper
with
that
boy
at
the
station
you
are
making
a
very
brilliant
start
bobby
my
by
this
time
he
had
left
the
little
town
behind
him
and
he
was
walking
along
a
very
lonely
and
dark
road
on
one
side
was
a
plantation
of
young
trees
on
the
other
there
was
the
open
ground
covered
with
furze
bush
of
the
village
common
where
the
plantation
ended
stood
a
low
house
of
medium
size
with
a
veranda
stretching
its
full
length
in
front
it
stood
back
from
the
road
some
distance
and
appeared
to
be
surrounded
by
a
large
garden
at
the
gate
dunn
halted
and
struck
a
match
as
if
to
light
a
pipe
and
by
the
flickering
flame
of
this
match
the
name
bittermeads
painted
on
the
gate
became
visible
here
it
is
then
he
muttered
i
wonder
without
completing
the
sentence
he
slipped
through
the
gate
which
was
not
quite
closed
and
entered
the
garden
where
he
crouched
down
in
the
shadow
of
some
bushes
that
grew
by
the
side
of
the
gravel
path
leading
to
the
house
and
seemed
to
compose
himself
for
a
long
vigil
an
hour
passed
and
another
nothing
had
happened
he
had
seen
nothing
heard
nothing
save
for
the
passing
of
an
occasional
vehicle
or
pedestrian
on
the
road
and
he
himself
had
never
stirred
or
moved
so
that
he
seemed
one
with
the
night
and
one
with
the
shadows
where
he
crouched
and
a
pair
of
that
had
come
from
the
common
opposite
went
to
and
fro
about
their
busy
occupations
at
his
feet
without
paying
him
the
least
attention
another
hour
passed
and
at
last
there
began
to
be
signs
of
life
about
the
house
a
light
shone
in
one
window
and
in
another
and
vanished
and
soon
the
door
opened
and
there
appeared
two
people
on
the
threshold
clearly
visible
in
the
light
of
a
strong
incandescent
just
within
the
hall
the
watcher
in
the
garden
moved
a
little
to
get
a
clearer
view
in
the
paroxysm
of
terror
at
this
sudden
coming
to
life
of
what
they
had
believed
to
be
a
part
of
the
bushes
the
two
little
scampered
away
and
dunn
bit
his
lip
with
annoyance
for
he
knew
well
that
some
of
those
he
had
had
traffic
with
in
the
past
would
have
been
very
sure
on
hearing
that
of
the
frightened
mice
that
some
one
was
lurking
near
at
hand
but
the
two
in
the
lighted
doorway
opening
on
the
veranda
heard
and
suspected
nothing
one
was
a
man
one
a
woman
both
were
young
both
were
extraordinarily
and
as
they
stood
in
the
blaze
of
the
gas
they
made
a
strikingly
handsome
and
attractive
picture
on
which
however
dunn
seemed
to
look
from
his
with
hostility
and
watchful
suspicion
how
dark
it
is
there
not
a
star
showing
the
girl
was
saying
shall
you
be
able
to
find
your
way
even
with
the
lantern
you
keep
to
the
road
wo
you
her
voice
was
low
and
pleasant
and
so
clear
dunn
heard
every
word
distinctly
she
seemed
quite
young
not
more
than
twenty
or
and
she
was
slim
and
graceful
in
build
and
tall
for
a
woman
her
face
on
which
the
light
shone
directly
was
oval
in
shape
with
a
broad
low
forehead
on
which
clustered
the
small
unruly
curls
of
her
dark
brown
hair
and
she
had
clear
and
very
bright
brown
eyes
the
mouth
and
chin
were
perhaps
a
little
large
to
be
in
absolute
harmony
with
the
rest
of
her
features
and
she
was
of
a
dark
complexion
with
a
soft
and
delicate
bloom
that
would
by
itself
have
given
her
a
right
to
claim
her
possession
of
a
full
share
of
good
looks
she
was
dressed
quite
simply
in
a
white
frock
with
a
touch
of
colour
at
the
waist
and
she
had
a
very
flimsy
lace
shawl
thrown
over
her
shoulders
presumably
intended
as
a
protection
against
the
night
air
her
companion
was
a
very
tall
and
big
man
well
over
six
feet
in
height
with
handsome
features
that
often
bore
an
expression
a
little
too
haughty
but
that
showed
now
a
very
tender
and
gentle
look
so
that
it
was
not
difficult
to
guess
the
state
of
his
feelings
towards
the
girl
at
his
side
his
shoulders
were
broad
his
chest
deep
and
his
whole
build
powerful
in
the
extreme
and
dunn
looking
him
up
and
down
with
the
quick
glance
of
one
accustomed
to
judge
men
thought
that
he
had
seldom
seen
one
more
capable
of
holding
his
own
answering
his
companion
remark
he
said
lightly
oh
no
i
shall
cut
across
the
wood
it
ever
so
much
shorter
you
but
it
so
dark
and
lonely
the
girl
protested
and
then
after
last
week
he
interrupted
her
with
a
laugh
and
he
lifted
his
head
with
a
certain
not
unpleasing
swagger
i
do
think
they
trouble
me
for
all
their
threats
he
said
for
that
matter
i
rather
hope
they
will
try
something
of
the
sort
on
they
need
a
oh
i
do
hope
you
be
careful
the
girl
exclaimed
he
laughed
again
and
made
another
remark
to
the
effect
that
he
did
not
think
any
one
was
likely
to
interfere
with
him
for
a
minute
or
two
longer
they
lingered
chatting
together
as
they
stood
in
the
on
the
veranda
and
from
his
dunn
watched
them
intently
it
seemed
that
it
was
the
girl
in
whom
he
was
chiefly
interested
for
his
eyes
hardly
moved
from
her
and
in
them
there
showed
a
very
grim
and
hard
expression
pretty
enough
he
mused
more
than
pretty
no
wonder
poor
charles
raved
about
her
if
it
the
same
girl
if
it
is
she
ought
to
know
what
become
of
him
but
then
where
does
this
big
chap
come
in
the
big
chap
seemed
really
going
now
though
reluctantly
and
it
was
not
difficult
to
see
that
he
would
have
been
very
willing
to
stay
longer
had
she
given
him
the
least
encouragement
but
that
he
did
not
get
and
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
a
little
bored
and
a
little
anxious
for
him
to
say
good
night
and
go
at
last
he
did
so
and
she
retired
within
the
house
while
he
came
swinging
down
the
garden
path
passing
close
to
where
dunn
lay
hidden
but
without
any
suspicion
of
his
presence
and
out
into
the
high
road
chapter
ii
the
fight
in
the
wood
from
his
in
the
bushes
dunn
slipped
out
as
the
big
man
vanished
into
the
darkness
down
the
road
and
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
he
seemed
to
hesitate
the
lights
in
the
house
were
coming
and
going
after
a
fashion
that
suggested
that
the
inmates
were
preparing
for
bed
and
almost
at
once
dunn
turned
his
back
to
the
building
and
hurried
very
quickly
and
softly
down
the
road
in
the
direction
the
big
man
had
just
taken
after
all
he
thought
the
house
ca
run
away
that
will
be
still
there
when
i
come
back
and
i
ought
to
find
out
who
this
big
chap
is
and
where
he
comes
in
spite
of
the
apparent
clumsiness
of
his
build
and
the
ungainliness
of
his
movements
it
was
extraordinary
how
swiftly
and
how
quietly
he
moved
a
shadow
could
scarcely
have
made
less
sound
than
this
man
did
as
he
melted
through
the
darkness
and
a
swift
runner
would
have
difficulty
in
keeping
pace
with
him
an
old
labourer
going
home
late
bade
the
big
man
a
friendly
good
night
and
passed
on
without
seeing
or
hearing
dunn
following
close
behind
and
a
solitary
woman
watching
at
her
cottage
door
saw
plainly
the
big
man
tall
form
and
heard
his
firm
and
heavy
steps
and
would
have
been
ready
to
swear
no
other
passed
that
way
at
that
time
though
dunn
was
not
five
yards
behind
slipping
silently
and
swiftly
by
in
the
shelter
of
the
trees
lining
the
road
a
little
further
beyond
this
cottage
a
path
reached
by
climbing
a
stile
led
from
the
high
road
first
across
an
open
field
and
then
through
the
heart
of
a
wood
that
seemed
to
be
of
considerable
extent
the
man
dunn
was
following
crossed
this
stile
and
when
he
had
gone
a
yard
or
two
along
the
path
he
halted
abruptly
as
though
all
at
once
grown
uneasy
and
looked
behind
from
where
he
stood
any
one
following
him
across
the
stile
must
have
shown
plainly
visible
against
the
sky
line
but
though
he
lingered
for
a
moment
or
two
and
even
when
he
walked
on
still
looked
back
very
frequently
he
saw
nothing
yet
dunn
when
his
quarry
paused
and
looked
back
like
this
was
only
a
little
distance
behind
and
when
the
other
moved
on
dunn
was
still
very
near
but
he
had
not
crossed
the
stile
for
when
he
came
to
it
he
realised
that
in
climbing
it
his
form
would
be
plainly
visible
in
outline
for
some
distance
and
so
instead
he
had
found
and
crawled
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
not
far
away
they
came
dunn
so
close
and
so
noiseless
behind
his
quarry
he
might
well
have
seemed
the
other
shadow
to
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
and
as
they
entered
it
dunn
made
his
first
fault
his
first
failure
in
an
exhibition
of
woodcraft
that
a
north
american
indian
or
an
australian
might
have
equalled
but
could
not
have
surpassed
for
he
trod
heavily
on
a
dry
twig
that
snapped
with
a
very
loud
sharp
retort
clearly
audible
for
some
distance
in
the
quiet
night
and
as
dry
twigs
only
snap
like
that
under
the
pressure
of
considerable
weight
the
presence
of
some
living
creature
in
the
wood
other
than
the
small
things
that
run
to
and
fro
beneath
the
trees
stood
revealed
to
all
ears
that
could
hear
dunn
stood
instantly
perfectly
still
rigid
as
a
statue
listening
intently
and
he
noted
with
satisfaction
and
keen
relief
that
the
regular
heavy
tread
of
the
man
in
front
did
not
alter
or
change
good
he
thought
to
himself
what
luck
he
has
heard
he
moved
on
again
as
silently
as
before
perhaps
a
little
inclined
to
be
contemptuous
of
any
one
who
could
fail
to
notice
so
plain
a
warning
and
he
supposed
that
the
man
he
was
following
must
be
some
townsman
who
knew
nothing
at
all
of
the
life
of
the
country
and
was
like
so
many
of
the
dwellers
in
cities
blind
and
deaf
outside
the
range
of
the
noises
of
the
streets
and
the
clamour
of
passing
traffic
this
thought
was
still
in
his
mind
when
all
at
once
the
steady
sound
of
footsteps
he
had
been
following
ceased
suddenly
and
abruptly
cut
off
on
the
instant
as
you
turn
off
water
from
a
tap
dunn
paused
too
supposing
that
for
some
reason
the
other
had
stopped
for
a
moment
and
would
soon
walk
on
again
but
a
minute
passed
and
then
another
and
there
was
still
no
sound
of
the
footsteps
beginning
again
a
little
puzzled
dunn
moved
cautiously
forward
he
saw
nothing
he
found
nothing
there
was
no
sign
at
all
of
the
man
he
had
been
following
it
was
as
though
he
had
vanished
bodily
from
the
face
of
the
earth
and
yet
how
this
had
happened
or
why
or
what
had
become
of
him
dunn
could
not
imagine
for
this
spot
was
it
seemed
in
the
very
heart
of
the
wood
there
was
no
shelter
of
any
sort
or
kind
anywhere
near
and
though
there
were
trees
all
round
just
the
ground
was
fairly
open
well
that
jolly
queer
he
muttered
for
indeed
it
had
a
strange
and
daunting
effect
this
sudden
disappearance
in
the
midst
of
the
wood
of
the
man
he
had
followed
so
far
and
the
silence
around
seemed
all
the
more
intense
now
that
those
regular
and
heavy
footsteps
had
ceased
jolly
queer
as
queer
a
thing
as
ever
i
came
across
he
muttered
again
he
listened
and
heard
a
faint
sound
from
his
right
he
listened
again
and
thought
he
heard
a
rustling
on
his
left
but
was
not
sure
and
all
at
once
a
great
figure
loomed
up
gigantic
before
him
and
the
light
of
lantern
gleamed
in
his
face
now
my
man
a
voice
said
you
been
following
me
ever
since
i
left
bittermeads
and
i
going
to
give
you
a
lesson
you
wo
forget
in
a
dunn
stood
quite
still
at
the
moment
his
chief
feeling
was
one
of
intense
discomfiture
at
the
way
in
which
he
had
been
outwitted
and
he
experienced
too
a
very
keen
and
genuine
admiration
for
the
woodcraft
the
other
had
shown
evidently
all
the
time
he
had
known
or
at
any
rate
suspected
that
he
was
being
followed
and
choosing
this
as
a
favourable
spot
he
had
quietly
doubled
on
his
tracks
come
up
behind
his
pursuer
and
taken
him
unawares
dunn
had
not
supposed
there
was
a
man
in
england
who
could
have
played
such
a
trick
on
him
but
his
admiration
was
roughly
disturbed
before
he
could
express
it
for
the
grasp
upon
his
collar
tightened
and
upon
his
shoulders
there
alighted
a
tremendous
stinging
blow
as
with
all
his
very
considerable
strength
the
big
man
brought
down
his
with
a
resounding
thwack
the
sheer
surprise
of
it
the
sudden
sharp
pain
jerked
a
quick
cry
from
dunn
who
had
not
been
in
the
least
prepared
for
such
an
attack
and
in
the
darkness
had
not
seen
the
stick
rise
and
the
other
laughed
grimly
yes
you
scoundrel
he
said
i
know
very
well
who
you
are
and
what
you
want
and
i
going
to
thrash
you
within
an
inch
of
your
again
the
stick
rose
in
the
air
but
did
not
fall
for
round
about
his
body
dunn
laid
such
a
grip
as
he
had
never
felt
before
and
as
would
for
certain
have
crushed
in
the
ribs
of
a
weaker
man
the
lantern
crashed
to
the
ground
they
were
in
darkness
ha
would
you
the
man
exclaimed
taken
by
surprise
in
his
turn
and
giant
as
he
was
he
felt
himself
plucked
up
from
the
ground
as
you
pluck
a
weed
from
a
lawn
and
held
for
a
moment
in
and
then
dashed
down
again
perhaps
not
another
man
alive
could
have
kept
his
footing
under
such
treatment
but
somehow
he
managed
to
though
it
needed
all
his
great
strength
to
resist
the
shock
he
flung
away
his
for
he
realized
very
clearly
now
that
this
was
not
going
to
be
as
he
had
anticipated
a
mere
case
of
the
administration
of
a
deserved
punishment
but
rather
the
starkest
fiercest
fight
that
ever
he
had
known
he
grappled
with
his
enemy
trying
to
make
the
most
of
his
superior
height
and
weight
but
the
long
arms
twined
about
him
seemed
to
press
the
very
breath
from
his
body
and
for
all
the
huge
efforts
he
put
forth
with
every
ounce
of
his
tremendous
strength
behind
them
he
could
not
break
loose
from
the
no
less
tremendous
grip
wherein
he
was
taken
breast
to
breast
they
fought
straining
swaying
a
little
this
way
or
that
but
neither
yielding
an
inch
their
muscles
stood
out
like
bars
of
steel
their
breath
came
heavily
neither
man
was
conscious
any
more
of
anything
save
his
need
to
conquer
and
win
and
overthrow
his
enemy
the
quick
passion
of
hot
rage
that
had
come
upon
dunn
when
he
felt
the
other
unexpected
blow
still
burned
and
flamed
intensely
so
that
he
no
longer
remembered
even
the
strange
and
high
purpose
which
had
brought
him
here
his
adversary
too
had
lost
all
consciousness
of
all
other
things
in
the
lust
of
this
fierce
physical
battle
and
when
he
gave
presently
a
loud
shout
it
was
not
fear
that
he
uttered
or
a
cry
for
aid
but
solely
for
joy
in
such
wild
struggle
and
efforts
as
he
had
never
known
before
and
dunn
spake
no
word
and
uttered
no
sound
but
strove
all
the
more
with
all
the
strength
of
every
nerve
and
muscle
he
possessed
once
again
to
pluck
the
other
up
that
he
might
dash
him
down
a
second
time
in
quick
and
heavy
gasps
came
their
breaths
as
they
still
swayed
and
struggled
together
and
though
each
exerted
to
the
utmost
a
strength
few
could
have
withstood
each
found
that
in
the
other
he
seemed
to
have
met
his
match
in
vain
dunn
tried
again
to
lift
his
adversary
up
so
that
he
might
hurl
him
to
the
ground
it
was
an
effort
a
grip
that
seemed
as
though
it
might
have
torn
up
an
oak
by
the
roots
but
the
other
neither
budged
nor
flinched
beneath
it
and
in
vain
in
his
turn
did
he
try
to
bend
dunn
backwards
to
crush
him
to
the
earth
it
was
an
effort
before
which
one
might
have
thought
that
iron
and
stone
must
have
given
away
but
dunn
still
sustained
it
thus
dreadfully
they
fought
there
in
the
darkness
there
in
the
silence
of
the
night
dreadfully
they
wrestled
implacable
fierce
determined
every
primeval
passion
awake
and
strong
again
and
slowly
very
slowly
that
awful
grip
laid
upon
the
big
man
body
began
to
tell
his
breathing
grew
more
difficult
his
efforts
seemed
aimed
more
to
release
himself
than
to
overcome
his
adversary
he
gave
way
an
inch
or
two
no
more
but
still
an
inch
or
two
of
ground
there
was
a
sharp
sound
like
a
thin
dry
twig
snapping
beneath
a
careless
foot
it
was
one
of
his
ribs
breaking
beneath
the
dreadful
and
intolerable
pressure
of
dunn
enormous
grip
but
neither
of
the
combatants
heard
or
knew
and
with
one
last
effort
the
big
man
put
forth
all
his
vast
strength
in
a
final
attempt
to
bear
his
enemy
down
dunn
resisted
still
resisted
though
the
veins
stood
out
like
cords
on
his
brow
though
a
little
trickle
of
blood
crept
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
though
his
heart
swelled
almost
to
bursting
there
was
a
sound
of
many
waters
in
his
ears
the
darkness
all
around
grew
shot
with
little
flames
he
could
hear
some
one
breathing
very
noisily
and
he
was
not
sure
whether
this
were
himself
or
his
adversary
till
he
realized
that
it
was
both
of
them
with
one
sudden
almost
superhuman
effort
he
heaved
his
great
adversary
up
but
had
not
strength
enough
left
to
do
more
than
let
him
slip
from
his
grasp
to
fall
on
the
ground
and
with
the
effort
he
himself
dropped
forward
on
his
hands
and
knees
just
as
a
lantern
shone
at
a
distance
and
a
voice
cried
this
way
tom
master
john
master
john
where
are
you
chapter
iii
a
coincidence
another
voice
answered
from
near
by
and
dunn
scrambled
hurriedly
to
his
feet
he
had
but
a
moment
in
which
to
decide
what
to
do
for
these
new
arrivals
were
coming
at
a
run
and
would
be
upon
him
almost
instantly
if
he
stayed
where
he
was
that
they
were
friends
of
the
man
he
had
just
overthrown
and
whose
huge
bulk
lay
motionless
in
the
darkness
at
his
feet
seemed
plain
and
it
also
seemed
plain
to
him
that
the
moment
was
not
an
opportune
one
for
offering
explanations
swiftly
he
decided
to
slip
away
into
the
darkness
what
had
happened
might
be
cleared
up
later
when
he
knew
more
and
was
more
sure
of
his
ground
at
present
he
must
think
first
he
told
himself
of
the
success
of
his
mission
physically
he
was
greatly
exhausted
and
his
gait
was
not
so
steady
nor
his
progress
so
silent
and
skillful
as
it
had
been
before
as
now
he
hurried
away
from
the
scene
of
the
combat
but
the
two
made
no
attempt
to
pursue
him
and
indeed
did
not
seem
to
give
his
possible
presence
in
the
vicinity
even
a
thought
as
with
many
muttered
exclamations
of
dismay
and
anger
they
stooped
over
the
body
of
his
prostrate
enemy
it
was
evident
they
recognized
him
at
once
and
that
he
was
the
mr
john
whose
name
they
had
called
for
so
they
spoke
of
him
to
each
other
as
they
busied
themselves
about
him
i
expect
i
been
a
fool
again
dunn
thought
to
himself
ruefully
as
from
a
little
distance
in
the
darkness
he
crouched
upon
the
ground
and
listened
and
watched
i
may
have
ruined
everything
any
one
but
a
fool
would
have
asked
him
what
he
meant
when
he
hit
out
like
that
instead
of
flying
into
a
rage
and
hitting
back
the
way
i
did
most
likely
it
was
some
mistake
when
he
said
he
knew
who
i
was
and
what
i
wanted
at
least
if
it
was
i
hope
i
have
killed
him
secure
in
the
protection
the
dark
night
afforded
him
he
remained
sufficiently
near
at
hand
to
be
able
to
assure
himself
soon
that
his
overthrown
adversary
was
certainly
not
killed
for
now
he
began
to
express
himself
somewhat
emphatically
concerning
the
manner
in
which
the
two
were
ministering
to
him
presently
he
got
to
his
feet
and
with
one
of
them
supporting
him
on
each
side
began
to
limp
away
and
dunn
followed
them
though
cautiously
and
at
a
distance
for
he
was
still
greatly
exhausted
and
in
neither
the
mood
nor
the
condition
for
running
unnecessary
risks
the
big
man
john
as
the
others
called
him
seemed
little
inclined
for
speech
but
the
others
talked
a
good
deal
subsiding
sometimes
when
he
told
them
gruffly
to
be
quiet
but
invariably
soon
beginning
again
their
expressions
of
sympathy
and
vows
of
vengeance
against
his
unknown
assailant
how
many
of
them
do
you
think
there
were
john
sir
one
asked
presently
i
lay
you
marked
a
fair
sight
of
the
there
was
only
one
man
john
answered
briefly
only
one
the
other
repeated
in
great
surprise
for
the
lord
sake
john
only
one
why
there
ai
any
one
man
between
here
and
lunnon
town
could
stand
up
to
you
sir
in
a
fair
well
he
did
john
answered
he
had
the
advantage
he
took
me
by
surprise
but
i
never
felt
such
a
grip
in
my
lor
now
think
of
that
said
the
other
in
tones
in
which
surprise
seemed
mingled
with
a
certain
incredulity
it
do
seem
possible
but
for
sure
then
he
do
come
from
these
here
parts
that
i
stand
i
knew
that
much
before
retorted
john
i
said
all
the
time
they
were
outsiders
a
london
gang
very
likely
you
have
to
get
rawson
bates
i
do
know
what
up
but
i
a
beast
of
a
pain
in
my
side
i
can
hardly
bates
murmured
respectful
sympathy
as
they
came
out
of
the
shelter
of
the
trees
and
crossing
some
open
ground
reached
a
road
along
the
further
side
of
which
ran
a
high
brick
wall
in
this
nearly
opposite
the
spot
where
they
emerged
on
the
road
was
a
small
door
which
one
of
the
men
opened
and
through
which
they
passed
and
locked
it
behind
them
leaving
dunn
without
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
to
scale
the
wall
and
continue
on
the
other
side
of
it
to
follow
them
calculating
the
direction
in
which
the
village
of
ramsdon
must
lie
he
turned
that
way
and
had
gone
only
a
short
distance
when
he
was
overtaken
by
a
pedestrian
with
whom
he
began
conversation
by
asking
for
a
light
for
his
pipe
the
man
seemed
inclined
to
be
conversational
and
after
a
few
casual
remarks
dunn
made
an
observation
on
the
length
of
the
wall
they
were
passing
and
to
the
end
of
which
they
had
just
come
must
be
a
place
in
there
he
said
whose
is
it
oh
that
there
ramsdon
place
the
other
answered
mr
john
clive
lives
there
now
his
father
dunn
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
road
who
what
he
stammered
who
who
did
you
say
mr
john
clive
the
other
repeated
why
what
wrong
about
that
nothing
nothing
dunn
answered
but
his
voice
shook
a
little
with
what
seemed
almost
fear
and
behind
the
darkness
of
the
friendly
night
his
face
had
become
very
pale
clive
john
clive
you
say
oh
need
believe
it
if
you
do
want
to
grumbled
the
other
only
what
do
you
want
asking
questions
for
if
you
thinks
folks
tells
lies
when
they
answers
them
i
did
mean
that
of
course
not
exclaimed
dunn
hurriedly
by
no
means
anxious
to
offend
the
other
i
very
sorry
i
only
meant
it
was
impossible
it
should
be
the
same
john
clive
i
knew
once
though
i
think
he
came
from
about
here
somewhere
a
little
man
i
mean
quite
bald
and
wears
glasses
oh
that
ai
this
answered
the
other
his
good
humour
quite
restored
this
is
a
young
man
and
tremendous
big
i
ai
so
small
myself
but
he
tops
me
by
a
head
and
shoulders
and
so
he
does
most
hereabouts
strong
too
with
it
there
ai
so
many
would
care
to
stand
up
against
him
i
can
tell
you
why
they
do
say
he
caught
two
poachers
in
the
wood
there
last
month
and
brought
out
one
under
each
arm
like
a
pair
of
squealing
did
he
though
said
dunn
take
some
doing
that
and
i
daresay
the
rest
of
the
gang
will
try
to
get
even
with
him
for
well
they
do
say
as
there
been
threats
the
other
agreed
but
what
i
says
is
as
john
can
look
after
hisself
all
right
there
was
a
tale
as
a
man
had
been
dodging
after
him
at
night
but
all
he
said
when
they
told
him
was
as
if
he
caught
any
one
after
him
he
would
thrash
them
within
an
inch
of
their
serve
them
right
too
exclaimed
dunn
warmly
evidently
this
explained
in
part
at
least
what
had
recently
happened
clive
finding
himself
being
followed
had
supposed
it
was
one
of
his
poaching
enemies
and
had
at
once
attempted
to
carry
out
his
threat
he
had
made
dunn
told
himself
at
any
rate
the
error
would
have
the
result
of
turning
all
suspicion
away
from
him
and
yet
he
still
seemed
very
disturbed
and
ill
at
ease
has
clive
been
here
long
he
asked
it
must
be
four
or
five
years
since
his
father
bought
the
place
answered
his
new
acquaintance
then
when
the
old
man
was
killed
a
year
ago
john
inherited
old
clive
was
killed
was
he
asked
dunn
and
his
voice
sounded
very
strange
in
the
darkness
how
was
that
accident
to
his
the
other
replied
i
do
hold
with
them
things
myself
give
me
a
good
horse
i
say
people
did
like
the
old
man
much
and
some
say
john
too
fond
of
taking
the
high
hand
but
do
cross
him
and
he
wo
cross
you
that
his
motto
and
dunn
agreed
and
asked
one
or
two
more
questions
about
the
details
of
the
accident
to
old
clive
in
which
he
seemed
very
interested
but
he
did
not
get
much
more
information
about
that
concerning
which
his
new
friend
evidently
knew
very
little
however
he
gave
dunn
a
few
more
facts
concerning
john
clive
as
that
he
was
unmarried
was
said
to
be
very
wealthy
and
had
the
reputation
of
being
something
of
a
man
a
little
further
on
they
parted
and
dunn
took
a
side
road
which
he
calculated
should
lead
him
back
to
bittermeads
it
may
be
pure
coincidence
he
mused
as
he
walked
slowly
in
a
very
troubled
and
doubtful
mood
but
if
so
it
a
very
queer
one
and
if
it
is
it
seems
to
me
john
clive
might
as
well
put
his
head
in
a
lion
jaws
as
pay
visits
at
bittermeads
but
of
course
he
ca
have
the
least
suspicion
of
the
truth
if
it
is
the
truth
if
i
had
lost
my
temper
like
a
fool
when
he
whacked
out
at
me
like
that
i
might
have
been
able
to
warn
him
or
find
out
something
useful
perhaps
and
his
father
killed
recently
in
an
accident
is
that
a
coincidence
too
i
wonder
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
on
which
a
light
sweat
stood
though
he
was
not
a
man
easily
affected
for
he
had
seen
and
endured
many
things
his
mind
was
very
full
of
strange
and
troubled
thoughts
as
at
last
he
came
back
to
bittermeads
where
leaning
with
his
elbows
on
the
garden
gate
he
stood
for
a
long
time
watching
the
dark
and
silent
house
and
thinking
of
that
scene
of
which
he
had
been
a
spectator
when
john
clive
and
the
girl
had
stood
together
on
the
veranda
in
the
light
of
the
gas
from
the
hall
and
had
bidden
each
other
good
night
it
seems
he
mused
as
though
the
last
that
was
seen
of
poor
charley
must
have
been
just
like
that
it
was
just
such
a
dark
night
as
this
when
simpson
saw
him
he
was
standing
on
that
veranda
when
simpson
recognized
him
by
the
light
of
the
gas
behind
and
a
girl
was
bidding
him
good
night
a
very
pretty
girl
too
simpson
silent
and
immobile
he
stood
there
a
long
time
not
so
much
now
as
one
who
watched
but
rather
as
if
deep
in
thought
for
his
head
was
bent
and
supported
on
his
hands
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
as
for
this
john
clive
he
muttered
presently
rousing
himself
i
suppose
that
must
be
a
coincidence
but
it
queer
and
queer
the
father
should
have
died
like
he
broke
off
shuddering
slightly
as
though
at
thoughts
too
awful
to
be
endured
and
pushing
open
the
gate
he
walked
slowly
up
the
gravel
path
towards
the
house
round
which
he
began
to
walk
going
very
slowly
and
cautiously
and
often
pausing
as
if
he
wished
to
make
as
close
examination
of
the
place
as
the
darkness
would
permit
more
by
habit
than
because
he
thought
there
was
any
need
of
it
he
moved
always
with
that
extreme
and
wonderful
dexterity
of
quietness
he
could
assume
at
will
and
as
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
building
and
came
behind
it
his
quick
ear
trained
by
many
an
emergency
to
pick
out
the
least
unusual
sound
caught
a
faint
continued
scratching
noise
so
faint
and
low
it
might
well
have
passed
unnoticed
all
at
once
he
understood
and
realized
that
some
one
quite
close
at
hand
was
stealthily
cutting
out
the
glass
from
one
of
the
panes
of
a
window
chapter
iv
a
woman
weeps
cautiously
he
glided
nearer
moving
as
noiselessly
as
any
shadow
seeming
indeed
but
one
shadow
the
more
in
the
heavy
surrounding
darkness
the
persistent
scratching
noise
continued
and
dunn
was
now
so
close
he
could
have
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
the
shoulder
of
the
man
who
was
causing
it
and
who
still
intent
and
busy
had
not
the
least
idea
of
the
other
proximity
a
faint
smile
touched
dunn
lips
the
situation
seemed
not
to
be
without
a
grim
humour
for
if
of
what
he
suspected
were
true
one
might
as
sensibly
and
safely
attempt
to
break
into
the
condemned
cell
at
pentonville
gaol
as
into
this
quiet
house
but
then
was
it
perhaps
possible
that
this
fellow
working
away
so
unconcernedly
within
of
him
was
in
reality
one
of
them
seeking
to
obtain
admittance
in
this
way
for
some
reason
of
his
own
some
private
treachery
it
might
be
or
some
dispute
to
dunn
that
did
not
seem
likely
more
probably
the
fellow
was
merely
an
ordinary
burglar
some
local
practitioner
of
the
housebreaking
art
perhaps
whose
it
was
to
have
hit
upon
this
house
to
rob
without
his
having
the
least
idea
of
the
nature
of
the
place
he
was
trying
to
enter
he
might
prove
a
useful
recruit
for
them
though
dunn
thought
and
a
sudden
idea
flashed
into
his
mind
vivid
and
startling
for
one
moment
he
thought
intently
weighing
in
his
mind
this
idea
that
had
come
to
him
so
suddenly
he
was
not
blind
to
the
risks
it
involved
but
his
eager
temperament
always
inclined
him
to
the
most
direct
and
often
to
the
most
dangerous
course
his
mind
was
made
up
his
plan
of
action
decided
the
scratching
of
the
burglar
tool
upon
the
glass
ceased
already
he
had
smeared
treacle
over
the
square
of
glass
he
intended
to
remove
and
had
covered
it
with
paper
so
as
to
be
able
to
take
it
out
easily
and
in
one
piece
without
the
risk
of
falling
fragments
betraying
him
through
the
gap
thus
made
he
thrust
his
arm
and
made
sure
there
were
no
alarms
fitted
and
no
obstacles
in
the
way
of
his
easy
entrance
cautiously
he
unfastened
the
window
and
cautiously
and
silently
lifted
the
sash
and
when
he
had
done
so
he
paused
and
listened
for
a
space
to
make
sure
no
one
was
stirring
and
that
no
alarm
had
been
caused
within
the
house
still
very
cautiously
and
with
the
utmost
precaution
to
avoid
making
even
the
least
noise
he
put
one
knee
upon
the
preparatory
to
climbing
in
and
as
he
did
so
dunn
touched
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
well
my
man
what
are
you
up
to
he
said
softly
and
without
a
word
without
giving
the
least
warning
the
burglar
a
man
evidently
of
determination
and
resource
swung
round
and
aimed
at
dunn
head
a
tremendous
blow
with
the
heavy
iron
jemmy
he
held
in
his
right
hand
but
dunn
was
not
unprepared
for
an
attack
and
those
bright
keen
eyes
of
his
seemed
able
to
see
as
well
in
the
dark
as
in
the
light
he
threw
up
his
left
hand
and
caught
the
other
wrist
before
that
deadly
blow
he
aimed
could
descend
and
at
the
same
instant
he
dashed
his
own
clenched
fist
full
into
the
burglar
face
as
it
happened
more
by
good
luck
than
intended
aim
the
blow
took
him
on
the
point
of
the
chin
he
dropped
instantly
collapsing
in
on
himself
as
falls
a
bullock
and
lay
unconscious
in
a
crumpled
heap
on
the
ground
for
a
little
dunn
waited
crouching
above
him
and
listening
for
the
least
sound
to
show
that
their
brief
scuffle
had
been
heard
but
it
had
all
passed
nearly
as
silently
as
quickly
within
the
house
everything
remained
silent
there
was
no
sound
audible
no
gleam
of
light
to
show
that
any
of
the
inmates
had
been
disturbed
taking
from
his
pocket
a
small
electric
dunn
turned
its
light
on
his
victim
he
seemed
a
man
of
middle
age
with
a
brutal
face
and
a
low
receding
forehead
his
lips
a
little
apart
showed
yellow
irregular
teeth
of
which
two
at
the
front
of
the
lower
jaw
had
been
broken
and
the
scar
of
an
old
wound
running
from
the
corner
of
his
left
eye
down
to
the
centre
of
his
cheek
added
to
the
sinister
and
forbidding
aspect
he
bore
his
build
was
heavy
and
powerful
and
near
by
where
he
had
dropped
it
when
he
fell
lay
the
jemmy
with
which
he
had
struck
at
dunn
it
was
a
heavy
thing
about
two
feet
in
length
and
with
one
end
nearly
as
sharp
as
that
of
a
chisel
dunn
picked
it
up
and
felt
it
thoughtfully
just
as
well
i
got
my
blow
in
first
he
mused
if
he
had
landed
that
fairly
on
my
skull
i
do
think
anything
else
in
this
world
would
ever
have
interested
me
any
stooping
over
the
unconscious
man
he
felt
in
his
pockets
and
found
an
revolver
fully
loaded
a
handful
of
cartridges
a
coil
of
thin
rope
an
electric
torch
a
tiny
dark
lantern
no
bigger
than
a
and
so
arranged
that
the
single
drop
of
light
it
permitted
to
escape
fell
on
one
spot
only
a
bunch
of
wires
dunn
rightly
guessed
to
be
skeleton
keys
used
for
opening
locks
quietly
together
with
some
tobacco
a
pipe
a
little
money
and
a
few
other
personal
belongings
of
no
special
interest
or
significance
these
dunn
replaced
where
he
had
found
them
but
the
revolver
the
rope
the
torch
the
dark
lantern
and
the
bunch
of
wires
he
took
possession
of
he
noticed
also
that
the
man
was
wearing
boots
and
rubber
gloves
and
these
last
he
also
kept
stooping
he
lifted
the
unconscious
man
on
to
his
shoulder
and
carried
him
with
perfect
ease
and
at
a
quick
pace
out
of
the
garden
and
across
the
road
to
the
common
opposite
where
in
a
convenient
spot
behind
some
furze
bushes
he
laid
him
down
when
he
comes
round
dunn
muttered
he
wo
know
where
he
is
or
what
happened
and
probably
his
one
idea
will
be
to
clear
off
as
quickly
as
possible
i
do
suppose
he
interfere
with
me
at
then
a
new
idea
seemed
to
strike
him
and
he
hurriedly
removed
his
own
coat
and
trousers
and
boots
and
exchanged
them
for
those
the
burglar
was
wearing
they
were
not
a
good
fit
but
he
could
get
them
on
and
the
idea
in
his
mind
was
that
if
the
police
of
the
district
began
searching
as
very
likely
they
would
for
john
clive
assailant
and
if
they
had
discovered
any
clues
in
the
shape
of
footprints
or
torn
bits
of
clothing
or
buttons
and
dunn
knew
his
attire
had
suffered
considerably
during
the
struggle
then
it
would
be
as
well
that
such
clues
should
lead
not
to
him
but
to
this
other
man
who
if
he
were
innocent
on
that
score
had
at
any
rate
been
guilty
of
attempting
to
carry
out
a
much
worse
offence
i
afraid
your
luck
out
old
chap
dunn
muttered
apostrophizing
the
unconscious
man
but
you
did
your
best
to
brain
me
and
that
gives
me
a
sort
of
right
to
make
you
useful
besides
if
the
police
do
run
you
in
it
wo
mean
anything
worse
than
a
few
questions
it
be
your
own
fault
if
you
ca
answer
anyhow
i
ca
afford
to
run
the
risk
of
some
blundering
fool
of
a
policeman
trying
to
arrest
me
for
assaulting
the
local
much
relieved
in
mind
for
he
had
been
greatly
worried
by
a
fear
that
this
encounter
with
john
clive
might
lead
to
highly
inconvenient
legal
proceedings
he
left
the
unlucky
burglar
lying
in
the
shelter
of
the
furze
bushes
and
returned
to
the
house
all
was
as
he
had
left
it
the
open
window
gaped
widely
almost
inviting
entrance
and
he
climbed
silently
within
the
apartment
in
which
he
found
himself
was
apparently
the
and
he
felt
his
way
cautiously
and
slowly
across
it
moving
with
infinite
care
so
as
to
avoid
making
even
the
least
noise
reaching
the
door
he
opened
it
and
went
out
into
the
hall
all
was
dark
and
silent
he
permitted
himself
here
to
flash
on
his
electric
torch
for
a
moment
and
he
saw
that
the
hall
was
spacious
and
used
as
a
lounge
for
there
were
several
chairs
clustered
in
its
centre
opposite
the
fireplace
there
were
two
or
three
doors
opening
from
it
and
almost
opposite
where
he
stood
were
the
stairs
a
broad
flight
leading
to
a
wide
landing
above
still
with
the
same
extreme
silence
and
care
he
began
to
ascend
these
stairs
and
when
he
was
about
up
he
became
aware
of
a
faint
and
strange
sound
that
came
trembling
through
the
silence
and
stillness
of
the
night
what
it
was
he
could
not
imagine
he
listened
for
a
time
and
then
resumed
his
silent
progress
with
even
more
care
than
previously
and
only
when
he
reached
the
landing
did
he
understand
that
this
faint
and
low
sound
he
heard
was
caused
by
a
woman
weeping
very
softly
in
one
of
the
rooms
near
by
silently
he
crossed
the
landing
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
seemed
to
come
now
too
he
saw
a
thread
of
light
showing
beneath
a
door
at
a
little
distance
and
when
he
crept
up
to
it
and
listened
he
could
hear
for
certain
that
it
was
from
within
this
room
that
there
came
the
sound
of
muffled
passionate
weeping
the
door
was
closed
but
he
turned
the
handle
so
carefully
that
he
made
not
the
least
sound
and
very
cautiously
he
began
to
push
the
door
back
the
tiniest
fraction
of
an
inch
at
a
time
so
that
even
one
watching
closely
could
never
have
said
that
it
moved
when
after
a
long
time
during
which
the
muffled
weeping
never
ceased
he
had
it
open
an
inch
or
two
he
leaned
forward
and
peeped
within
it
was
a
and
crouching
on
the
floor
near
the
fireplace
in
front
of
a
low
her
head
hidden
on
her
arms
and
resting
on
the
seat
of
the
chair
was
the
figure
of
a
girl
she
had
made
no
preparations
for
retiring
and
by
the
frock
she
wore
dunn
recognized
her
as
the
girl
he
had
seen
on
the
veranda
bidding
to
john
clive
the
sound
of
her
weeping
was
very
pitiful
her
attitude
was
full
of
an
utter
and
poignant
despair
there
was
something
touching
in
the
extreme
in
the
utter
abandonment
to
grief
shown
by
this
young
and
lovely
creature
who
seemed
framed
only
for
joy
and
laughter
the
stern
features
and
hard
eyes
of
the
unseen
watcher
softened
then
all
at
once
they
grew
like
tempered
steel
again
for
on
the
mantlepiece
just
above
where
the
weeping
girl
crouched
stood
a
photograph
the
photograph
of
a
young
and
man
across
it
in
a
boyish
and
somewhat
unformed
hand
was
written
devotedly
yours
charley
it
was
this
photograph
that
had
caught
dunn
eyes
both
it
and
the
writing
and
the
signature
he
recognized
and
his
look
was
very
stern
his
eyes
as
cold
as
death
itself
as
slowly
slowly
he
pushed
back
the
door
of
the
room
another
inch
or
so
chapter
a
woman
and
a
man
the
girl
stirred
it
was
as
though
some
knowledge
of
the
slow
opening
of
the
door
had
penetrated
to
her
consciousness
before
as
yet
she
actually
saw
or
heard
anything
she
rose
to
her
feet
drying
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
and
as
she
was
moving
to
a
drawer
near
to
get
a
clean
one
her
glance
fell
on
the
door
i
thought
i
shut
it
she
said
aloud
in
a
puzzled
manner
she
crossed
the
floor
to
the
door
and
closed
it
with
a
push
from
her
hand
and
in
the
passage
outside
dunn
stood
still
not
certain
what
to
do
next
but
for
that
photograph
he
might
have
gone
quietly
away
giving
up
the
reckless
plan
that
had
formed
itself
so
suddenly
in
his
mind
while
he
watched
the
burglar
at
work
that
photograph
however
with
its
suggestion
that
he
stood
indeed
on
the
brink
of
the
solution
of
the
mystery
seemed
a
summons
to
him
to
go
on
it
was
as
though
a
voice
from
the
dead
called
him
to
continue
on
his
task
to
punish
and
to
save
and
slowly
very
slowly
with
an
infinite
caution
he
turned
again
the
handle
of
the
door
and
still
very
slowly
still
with
the
same
infinite
caution
he
pushed
back
the
door
the
merest
fraction
of
an
inch
at
a
time
so
that
not
even
one
watching
could
have
said
that
it
moved
when
he
had
it
once
more
so
far
open
that
he
could
see
within
he
bent
forward
to
look
the
girl
was
beginning
her
preparations
for
the
night
now
she
had
assumed
a
long
and
standing
in
front
of
the
mirror
she
had
just
finished
brushing
her
hair
and
was
beginning
to
fasten
it
up
in
a
long
plait
he
could
see
her
face
in
the
mirror
her
deep
sad
eyes
swollen
with
crying
her
cheeks
still
her
mouth
yet
quivering
with
emotion
he
was
still
watching
her
when
as
if
growing
uneasy
she
turned
her
head
and
glanced
over
her
shoulder
and
though
he
moved
back
so
quickly
that
she
did
not
catch
sight
of
him
she
saw
that
the
door
was
open
once
more
what
can
be
the
matter
with
the
door
she
exclaimed
aloud
and
she
crossed
the
room
towards
it
with
a
quick
and
somewhat
impatient
movement
but
this
time
instead
of
closing
it
she
pulled
it
open
and
found
herself
face
to
face
with
dunn
he
did
not
speak
or
move
and
she
stood
staring
at
him
blankly
slowly
her
mouth
opened
as
though
to
utter
a
cry
that
however
could
not
rise
above
her
fluttering
throat
her
face
had
taken
on
the
pallor
of
death
her
great
eyes
showed
the
awful
fear
she
felt
still
without
speaking
dunn
stepped
forward
into
the
room
and
closing
the
door
stood
with
his
back
to
it
she
shrank
away
and
put
her
hand
upon
a
chair
but
for
the
support
of
which
she
must
certainly
have
fallen
for
her
limbs
were
trembling
so
violently
they
gave
her
little
support
do
hurt
me
she
panted
in
truth
he
presented
a
strange
and
terrifying
appearance
the
unkempt
hair
that
covered
his
face
and
through
which
his
keen
eyes
glowed
like
fire
gave
him
an
unusual
and
formidable
aspect
in
one
hand
he
held
the
jemmy
he
had
taken
from
the
burglar
and
the
new
clothes
he
had
donned
and
soiled
served
to
accentuate
the
ungainliness
of
his
form
the
frightened
girl
was
not
even
sure
that
he
was
human
and
she
shrank
yet
further
away
from
him
till
she
sank
down
upon
the
bed
dizzy
with
fear
and
almost
swooning
as
yet
he
had
not
spoken
for
his
eyes
had
gone
to
the
mantlepiece
on
which
he
saw
that
the
photograph
signed
with
the
name
charley
wright
did
not
now
stand
upright
but
had
fallen
forward
on
its
face
so
that
one
could
no
longer
see
what
it
represented
it
must
have
fallen
just
as
he
entered
the
room
and
this
seemed
to
him
an
omen
though
whether
of
good
or
ill
he
did
not
know
who
are
you
the
girl
stammered
what
do
you
want
he
looked
at
her
moodily
and
still
without
answering
though
in
his
bright
and
keen
eyes
a
strange
light
burned
she
was
lovely
he
thought
of
that
there
could
be
no
question
but
her
beauty
made
to
him
small
appeal
for
he
was
wondering
what
kind
of
soul
lay
behind
those
perfect
features
that
smooth
and
delicate
skin
those
luminous
eyes
yet
his
eyes
were
still
hard
and
it
was
in
his
roughest
gruffest
tones
that
he
said
you
need
be
afraid
i
wo
hurt
i
give
you
everything
i
have
she
panted
if
only
you
go
not
so
fast
as
all
that
he
answered
coolly
for
indeed
he
had
not
taken
so
mad
a
risk
in
order
to
go
away
again
if
he
could
help
it
who
is
there
in
the
house
besides
you
only
mother
she
answered
looking
up
at
him
very
pleadingly
as
if
in
hopes
that
he
must
relent
when
he
saw
her
in
distress
please
you
take
what
you
want
and
go
away
please
do
disturb
mother
it
would
nearly
kill
i
not
going
to
hurt
either
you
or
your
mother
if
you
be
sensible
he
said
irritably
for
unreasonably
enough
the
extreme
fear
she
showed
and
her
pleading
tones
annoyed
him
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
would
like
to
shake
her
it
was
so
absurd
of
her
to
look
at
him
as
though
she
expected
him
to
gobble
her
up
in
a
mouthful
she
seemed
a
little
reassured
mother
will
be
so
dreadfully
frightened
she
repeated
i
give
you
everything
there
is
in
the
house
if
only
you
go
at
i
can
take
everything
i
want
without
your
giving
it
me
he
retorted
how
do
i
know
you
telling
the
truth
when
you
say
there
no
one
else
in
the
house
how
many
servants
have
you
none
she
answered
there
a
woman
comes
every
day
but
she
sleep
do
you
live
all
alone
here
with
your
mother
he
asked
watching
her
keenly
there
my
stepfather
she
answered
but
he
not
here
oh
is
he
away
dunn
asked
his
expression
almost
one
of
disappointment
the
girl
whose
first
extreme
fear
had
passed
and
who
was
watching
him
as
keenly
as
he
watched
her
noticed
this
manner
of
disappointment
and
could
not
help
wondering
what
sort
of
burglar
it
was
who
was
not
pleased
to
hear
that
the
man
of
the
house
was
away
and
that
he
had
only
two
women
to
deal
with
and
it
appeared
to
her
that
he
seemed
not
only
disappointed
but
rather
at
a
loss
what
to
do
next
as
in
truth
he
was
for
that
the
stepfather
should
be
away
and
this
girl
and
her
mother
all
alone
was
perhaps
the
one
possibility
that
he
had
never
considered
she
noticed
too
that
he
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
her
jewellery
which
was
lying
close
to
his
hand
on
the
and
though
in
point
of
actual
fact
this
jewellery
was
not
of
any
great
value
it
was
exceedingly
precious
in
her
eyes
and
she
did
not
understand
a
burglar
who
showed
no
eagerness
to
seize
on
it
did
you
want
to
see
dawson
she
asked
her
voice
more
confident
now
and
even
with
a
questioning
note
in
it
mr
dawson
who
he
dunn
asked
disconcerted
by
the
question
but
not
wishing
to
seem
so
my
stepfather
deede
dawson
she
answered
i
think
you
knew
that
if
you
want
him
he
went
to
london
early
today
but
i
think
it
quite
likely
he
may
come
back
what
should
i
want
him
for
growled
dunn
more
and
more
disconcerted
as
he
saw
that
he
was
not
playing
his
part
too
well
i
do
know
she
answered
i
suppose
you
you
suppose
a
lot
he
retorted
roughly
now
you
listen
to
me
i
want
to
hurt
you
but
i
do
mean
to
be
interfered
with
i
going
over
the
house
to
see
what
i
can
find
that
worth
taking
understand
oh
perfectly
she
said
she
was
watching
him
closely
and
she
noticed
that
he
still
made
no
attempt
to
take
possession
of
her
jewellery
though
it
lay
at
his
hand
and
that
puzzled
her
very
much
indeed
for
she
supposed
the
very
first
thing
a
burglar
did
was
always
to
seize
such
treasures
as
these
of
hers
but
this
man
paid
them
no
attention
whatever
and
did
not
even
notice
them
he
was
feeling
in
his
pockets
now
and
he
took
out
the
revolver
and
the
coil
of
thin
rope
he
had
secured
from
the
burglar
now
do
you
know
what
i
going
to
do
he
asked
with
an
air
of
roughness
and
brutality
that
was
a
little
overdone
he
put
the
revolver
and
the
rope
down
on
the
bed
the
revolver
quite
close
to
her
i
going
he
continued
to
tie
you
up
to
one
of
those
chairs
i
ca
risk
your
playing
any
tricks
or
giving
an
alarm
perhaps
while
i
searching
the
house
i
shall
take
what
worth
having
and
then
i
shall
clear
off
and
if
your
stepfather
coming
home
tonight
you
have
to
wait
long
till
he
releases
you
and
if
he
do
come
i
help
he
turned
his
back
to
her
as
he
spoke
and
took
hold
of
one
of
the
chairs
in
the
room
and
then
of
another
and
looked
at
them
as
though
carefully
considering
which
would
be
the
best
to
use
for
the
carrying
out
of
his
threat
he
appeared
to
find
it
difficult
to
decide
for
he
kept
his
back
turned
to
her
for
two
or
three
minutes
during
all
of
which
time
the
revolver
lay
on
the
bed
quite
close
to
her
hand
he
listened
intently
for
he
fully
expected
her
to
snatch
it
up
and
he
wished
to
be
ready
to
turn
before
she
could
actually
fire
but
indeed
nothing
was
further
from
her
thoughts
for
she
did
not
know
in
the
least
how
to
use
the
weapon
or
even
how
to
fire
it
off
and
the
very
thought
of
employing
it
to
kill
any
one
would
have
terrified
her
far
more
even
than
had
done
her
experiences
of
this
night
so
the
pistol
lay
untouched
by
her
side
while
very
pale
and
trembling
a
little
she
waited
what
he
would
do
and
on
his
side
he
felt
as
much
puzzled
by
her
failure
to
use
the
opportunity
he
had
put
in
her
way
as
she
was
puzzled
by
his
neglect
to
seize
her
jewellery
lying
ready
to
his
hand
he
was
still
hesitating
still
appearing
unable
to
decide
which
chair
to
employ
in
carrying
out
his
proclaimed
purpose
of
fastening
her
up
when
she
asked
a
question
that
made
him
swing
round
upon
her
very
quickly
and
with
a
very
startled
look
are
you
a
real
burglar
she
said
chapter
vi
a
discovery
what
do
you
mean
dunn
asked
quickly
the
matted
growth
of
hair
on
his
face
served
well
to
hide
any
change
of
expression
but
his
eyes
betrayed
him
with
their
look
of
surprise
and
discomfiture
and
in
her
own
clear
and
steady
glance
appeared
now
a
kind
of
puzzled
mockery
as
if
she
understood
well
that
all
he
did
was
done
for
some
purpose
though
what
that
purpose
was
still
perplexed
her
i
mean
she
said
slowly
well
what
do
i
mean
i
am
only
asking
a
question
are
you
a
burglar
or
have
you
come
here
for
some
other
reason
i
do
know
what
you
getting
at
he
grumbled
think
i
here
for
fun
not
me
come
and
sit
on
this
chair
and
put
your
hands
behind
you
and
do
make
a
noise
or
scream
or
anything
not
if
you
value
your
i
do
know
that
i
do
very
much
she
answered
with
a
manner
of
extreme
bitterness
but
more
as
if
speaking
to
herself
than
to
him
she
did
as
he
ordered
and
he
proceeded
to
tie
her
wrists
together
and
to
fasten
them
to
the
back
of
the
chair
on
which
she
had
seated
herself
he
was
careful
not
to
draw
the
cords
too
tight
but
at
the
same
time
he
made
the
fastening
secure
you
wo
disturb
mother
will
you
she
asked
quietly
when
he
had
finished
her
room
the
one
at
the
end
of
the
i
do
want
to
disturb
any
one
he
answered
i
only
want
to
get
off
quietly
i
wo
gag
you
but
do
you
try
to
make
any
noise
if
you
do
i
come
back
understand
oh
perfectly
she
answered
may
i
ask
one
question
do
you
feel
very
proud
of
yourself
just
now
he
did
not
answer
but
went
out
of
the
room
quickly
and
he
had
an
impression
that
she
smiled
as
she
watched
him
go
and
that
her
smile
was
bitter
and
a
little
contemptuous
what
a
girl
he
muttered
she
scored
every
time
i
did
find
out
a
thing
she
did
do
anything
i
expected
or
wanted
her
to
she
seemed
as
if
she
spotted
me
right
off
i
wonder
if
she
did
i
wonder
if
she
could
be
trusted
but
then
he
thought
of
that
photograph
on
the
mantelpiece
and
his
look
grew
stern
and
hard
again
he
was
careful
to
avoid
the
room
the
girl
had
indicated
as
occupied
by
her
mother
but
of
all
the
others
on
that
floor
he
made
a
hasty
search
without
discovering
anything
to
interest
him
or
anything
of
the
least
importance
or
at
all
unusual
from
the
wide
landing
in
the
centre
of
the
house
a
narrow
stairway
hidden
away
behind
an
angle
of
the
wall
so
that
one
did
not
notice
it
at
first
led
above
to
three
large
attics
with
roofs
and
evidently
designed
more
for
storage
purposes
than
for
habitation
the
doors
of
two
of
these
were
open
and
within
was
merely
a
collection
of
such
lumber
as
soon
accumulates
in
any
house
the
door
of
the
third
attic
was
locked
but
by
aid
of
the
jemmy
he
still
carried
he
forced
it
open
without
difficulty
within
was
nothing
but
a
square
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
otherwise
the
light
of
the
electric
torch
he
flashed
around
showed
only
the
bare
boarding
of
the
floor
and
the
bare
plastered
walls
near
the
a
hammer
and
some
nails
lay
on
the
floor
and
the
lid
was
in
position
but
was
not
fastened
as
though
some
interruption
had
occurred
before
the
task
of
nailing
it
down
could
be
completed
dunn
noted
that
one
nail
had
been
driven
home
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
attic
for
he
knew
he
had
not
much
time
and
hoped
that
downstairs
he
would
be
able
to
make
some
discoveries
of
importance
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
might
be
wise
to
see
what
was
in
this
case
the
nailing
down
the
lid
of
which
had
not
been
completed
he
crossed
the
room
to
it
and
without
drawing
the
one
nail
pushed
back
the
lid
which
pivoted
on
it
quite
easily
within
appeared
a
covering
of
coarse
sacking
he
pulled
this
away
with
a
careless
hand
and
beneath
the
beam
of
his
electric
torch
showed
the
pale
and
dreadful
features
of
a
dead
man
of
a
man
the
center
of
whose
forehead
showed
the
small
round
hole
where
a
bullet
had
entered
in
of
a
man
whose
features
were
those
of
the
photograph
on
the
of
the
room
downstairs
the
photograph
that
was
signed
devotedly
yours
charley
for
a
long
time
robert
dunn
stood
looking
down
in
silence
at
that
dead
face
which
was
hardly
more
still
more
rigid
than
his
own
he
shivered
for
he
felt
very
cold
it
was
as
though
the
coldness
of
the
death
in
whose
presence
he
stood
had
laid
its
chilly
hand
on
him
also
at
last
he
stirred
and
looked
about
him
with
a
bewildered
air
then
carefully
and
with
a
reverent
hand
he
put
back
the
sackcloth
covering
so
i
found
you
charley
he
whispered
found
you
at
he
replaced
the
lid
leaving
everything
as
it
had
been
when
he
entered
the
attic
and
stood
for
a
time
trying
to
collect
his
thoughts
which
the
shock
of
this
dreadful
discovery
had
so
disordered
and
to
decide
what
to
do
next
but
then
that
simple
he
thought
i
must
go
straight
to
the
police
and
bring
them
here
they
said
they
wanted
proof
they
said
i
had
nothing
to
go
on
but
bare
suspicion
but
that
evidence
enough
to
hang
deede
dawson
the
girl
too
then
he
wondered
whether
it
could
be
that
she
knew
nothing
and
was
innocent
of
all
part
or
share
in
this
dreadful
deed
but
how
could
that
be
possible
how
could
it
be
that
such
a
crime
committed
in
the
house
in
which
she
lived
could
remain
unknown
to
her
on
the
other
hand
when
he
thought
of
her
clear
candid
eyes
when
he
remembered
her
gentle
beauty
it
did
not
seem
conceivable
that
behind
them
could
lie
hidden
the
tigerish
soul
of
a
murderess
that
only
sentiment
though
he
muttered
nothing
more
beautiful
women
have
been
rotten
bad
through
and
through
before
today
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
go
and
inform
the
police
and
get
them
here
as
soon
as
possible
if
she
innocent
i
suppose
she
be
able
to
prove
he
hesitated
a
moment
as
he
thought
of
how
he
had
left
her
bound
and
a
prisoner
it
seemed
brutal
to
leave
her
like
that
while
he
was
away
for
he
would
probably
be
some
time
absent
but
with
a
hard
look
he
told
himself
that
whatever
pain
she
suffered
she
must
endure
it
his
first
and
sole
thought
must
be
to
bring
to
justice
the
murderers
of
his
unfortunate
friend
and
to
secure
too
thereby
the
success
almost
certainly
of
his
own
mission
to
release
her
and
leave
her
at
liberty
might
endanger
the
attainment
of
both
those
ends
and
so
she
must
remain
a
prisoner
only
he
muttered
if
she
knew
the
attic
almost
over
her
head
held
such
a
secret
why
did
she
take
the
chance
i
gave
her
of
getting
hold
of
my
revolver
that
she
did
looks
as
if
she
knew
but
then
he
thought
again
of
the
photograph
in
her
room
and
remembered
that
agony
of
grief
to
which
she
had
been
surrendering
herself
when
he
first
saw
her
now
those
passionate
tears
of
hers
seemed
to
him
like
remorse
i
leave
her
where
she
is
he
decided
again
i
ca
help
it
i
must
run
any
risks
my
first
duty
is
to
get
the
police
here
and
have
deede
dawson
he
went
down
the
stairs
still
deep
in
thought
and
when
he
reached
the
landing
below
he
would
not
even
go
to
make
sure
that
his
captive
was
still
secure
an
obscure
feeling
that
he
did
not
wish
to
see
her
and
still
more
that
he
did
not
wish
her
to
see
him
prevented
him
he
descended
the
second
flight
of
steps
to
the
hall
taking
fewer
precautions
to
avoid
making
a
noise
and
still
very
deep
in
thought
for
some
time
he
had
had
but
little
hope
that
young
charley
wright
still
lived
nevertheless
the
dreadful
discovery
he
had
made
in
the
attic
above
had
affected
him
profoundly
and
left
his
mind
in
a
chaos
of
emotions
so
that
he
was
for
the
time
much
less
acutely
watchful
than
usual
they
had
spent
their
boyhood
together
and
he
remembered
a
thousand
incidents
of
their
childhood
they
had
been
at
school
and
college
together
and
how
brilliantly
charley
had
always
done
at
work
and
play
surmounting
every
difficulty
with
a
laugh
as
if
it
were
merely
some
new
and
specially
amusing
jest
every
one
had
thought
well
of
him
every
one
had
believed
that
his
future
career
would
be
brilliant
now
it
had
ended
in
this
obscure
and
dreadful
fashion
as
ends
the
life
of
a
trapped
rat
dunn
found
himself
hardly
able
to
realize
that
it
was
really
so
and
through
all
the
confused
medley
of
his
thoughts
there
danced
and
flickered
his
memory
of
a
young
and
lovely
face
now
now
smiling
now
pale
with
terror
now
calmly
disdainful
can
she
have
known
he
muttered
she
must
have
known
she
ca
have
known
it
not
possible
either
he
shuddered
and
as
he
put
his
foot
on
the
lowest
stair
he
raised
his
hands
to
cover
his
face
as
though
to
shut
out
the
visions
that
passed
before
him
another
step
forward
he
took
in
the
darkness
and
all
at
once
there
flashed
upon
him
the
light
of
a
strong
electric
torch
suddenly
switched
on
put
up
your
hands
said
a
voice
sharply
or
you
a
dead
he
looked
bewilderedly
taken
altogether
by
surprise
and
saw
he
was
faced
by
a
fat
little
man
with
a
smooth
chubby
smiling
face
and
eyes
that
were
cold
and
grey
and
deadly
and
who
held
in
one
hand
a
revolver
levelled
at
his
heart
put
up
your
hands
this
newcomer
said
again
his
voice
level
and
calm
his
eyes
intent
and
deadly
put
up
your
hands
or
i
chapter
vii
question
and
answer
dunn
obeyed
promptly
there
was
that
about
this
little
fat
smiling
man
and
his
unsmiling
eyes
which
proclaimed
very
plainly
that
he
was
quite
ready
to
put
his
threat
into
execution
for
a
moment
or
two
they
stood
thus
each
regarding
the
other
very
intently
dunn
his
hands
in
the
air
the
steady
barrel
of
the
pistol
levelled
at
his
heart
knew
that
never
in
all
his
adventurous
life
had
he
been
in
such
deadly
peril
as
now
and
the
grotesque
thought
came
into
his
mind
to
wonder
if
there
were
room
for
two
in
that
in
the
attic
or
perhaps
no
attempt
would
be
made
to
hide
his
death
since
after
all
it
is
always
permissible
to
shoot
an
armed
burglar
the
clock
on
the
stairs
began
to
strike
the
hour
and
he
wondered
if
he
would
still
be
alive
when
the
last
stroke
sounded
he
did
not
much
think
so
for
he
thought
he
could
read
a
very
deadly
purpose
in
the
other
cold
grey
eyes
nor
did
he
suppose
that
a
man
with
such
a
secret
as
that
of
the
attic
upstairs
to
hide
was
likely
to
stand
on
any
scruple
and
he
thought
that
if
he
still
lived
when
the
clock
finished
striking
he
would
take
it
for
an
omen
of
good
hope
the
last
stroke
sounded
and
died
away
into
the
silence
of
the
night
the
revolver
was
still
levelled
at
his
heart
the
grim
purpose
in
the
other
eyes
had
not
changed
and
yet
dunn
drew
a
breath
of
deep
relief
as
though
the
worst
of
the
danger
was
past
through
his
mind
that
had
been
a
little
dulled
by
the
sudden
consciousness
of
so
extreme
a
peril
thought
began
again
to
race
with
more
than
normal
rapidity
and
clearness
it
occurred
to
him
with
a
sense
of
the
irony
of
the
position
that
when
he
entered
this
house
it
had
been
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
getting
himself
discovered
by
the
inmates
believing
that
to
show
himself
to
them
in
the
character
of
a
burglar
might
gain
him
their
confidence
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
so
he
might
come
to
be
accepted
as
one
of
them
and
perhaps
learn
in
time
the
secret
of
their
plans
the
danger
that
they
might
adopt
the
other
course
of
handing
him
over
to
the
police
had
not
seemed
to
him
very
great
for
he
had
his
reasons
for
believing
that
there
would
be
no
great
desire
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
authorities
to
bittermeads
for
any
reason
whatever
but
the
discovery
he
had
made
in
the
attic
changed
all
that
it
changed
his
plans
for
now
he
could
go
to
the
police
immediately
and
it
changed
also
his
conception
of
how
these
people
were
likely
to
act
before
it
had
not
entered
his
mind
to
suppose
that
he
ran
any
special
risk
of
being
shot
at
sight
but
now
he
understood
that
the
only
thing
standing
between
him
and
instant
death
was
the
faint
doubt
in
his
captor
mind
as
to
how
much
he
knew
it
seemed
to
him
his
only
hope
was
to
carry
out
his
original
plan
and
try
to
pass
himself
off
as
the
sort
of
person
who
might
be
likely
to
be
useful
to
the
master
of
bittermeads
do
shoot
sir
he
said
in
a
kind
of
high
whine
i
ai
done
no
harm
and
it
a
fair
cop
and
me
not
a
month
out
of
dartmoor
gaol
i
shall
get
a
hot
for
this
i
the
little
fat
man
did
not
answer
his
eyes
were
as
deadly
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
as
steady
as
before
dunn
wondered
if
it
were
from
that
pistol
had
issued
the
bullet
that
had
drilled
so
neat
and
round
a
hole
in
his
friend
forehead
he
supposed
so
he
said
again
do
shoot
deede
dawson
sir
i
ai
done
no
oh
you
know
my
name
do
you
you
scoundrel
deede
dawson
said
a
little
surprised
yes
sir
dunn
answered
we
always
find
out
as
much
as
we
can
about
a
crib
before
we
get
to
i
see
said
dawson
very
praiseworthy
attention
to
business
and
all
that
pray
what
did
you
find
out
about
me
only
as
you
was
to
be
away
tonight
sir
answered
dunn
and
that
there
did
seem
to
be
any
other
man
in
the
house
and
of
course
how
the
house
lay
and
the
garden
and
so
but
i
did
know
as
you
was
coming
home
so
no
i
do
suppose
you
did
said
deede
dawson
i
ai
done
no
harm
dunn
urged
making
his
voice
as
whining
and
pleading
as
he
could
i
only
just
been
looking
round
the
two
top
floors
i
ai
touched
a
thing
give
a
cove
a
chance
you
been
looking
round
have
you
said
deede
dawson
slowly
did
you
find
anything
to
interest
you
i
only
been
in
the
bedrooms
and
the
attics
answered
dunn
changing
not
a
muscle
of
his
countenance
and
thinking
boldness
his
safest
course
for
he
knew
well
the
slightest
sign
or
hint
of
knowledge
that
he
gave
would
mean
his
death
i
only
just
come
downstairs
when
you
copped
me
sir
i
ai
touched
a
thing
in
one
of
these
rooms
down
have
you
said
deede
dawson
slowly
and
his
face
was
paler
his
eyes
more
deadly
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
yet
more
inflexibly
steady
than
before
more
clearly
still
did
dunn
realize
that
the
faintest
breath
of
suspicion
stirring
in
the
other
mind
that
he
knew
of
what
was
hidden
in
the
attic
would
mean
certain
death
and
just
such
another
neat
little
hole
bored
through
heart
or
brain
as
that
he
had
seen
showing
in
the
forehead
of
his
dead
friend
have
you
though
deede
dawson
repeated
the
bedrooms
the
attics
that
all
yes
sir
that
all
take
my
oath
that
all
dunn
repeated
earnestly
as
if
he
wished
very
much
to
impress
on
his
captor
that
he
had
searched
bedrooms
and
attics
thoroughly
but
not
these
downstairs
rooms
deede
dawson
was
plainly
puzzled
and
for
the
first
time
a
little
doubt
seemed
to
show
in
his
hard
grey
eyes
dunn
perceived
that
a
need
was
on
him
to
know
for
certain
whether
his
dreadful
secret
had
been
discovered
or
not
until
he
had
assured
himself
on
that
point
dunn
felt
comparatively
safe
but
he
still
knew
also
that
to
allow
the
faintest
suspicion
to
dawn
in
deede
dawson
mind
would
mean
for
him
instant
death
he
saw
too
watching
very
warily
and
ready
to
take
advantage
of
any
momentary
slip
or
forgetfulness
how
steady
was
deede
dawson
hand
how
firm
and
watchful
his
eyes
with
many
men
with
most
men
indeed
dunn
would
have
seized
or
made
some
opportunity
to
dash
in
and
attack
taking
the
chance
of
being
shot
down
first
since
there
are
few
indeed
really
skilled
in
the
use
of
a
revolver
the
most
tricky
if
the
most
deadly
of
weapons
but
he
realized
he
had
small
hope
of
taking
unawares
this
fat
little
smiling
man
with
the
unsmiling
eyes
and
steady
hand
and
he
was
well
convinced
that
the
first
doubtful
movement
he
made
would
bring
a
bullet
crashing
through
his
brain
his
only
hope
was
in
delay
and
in
diverting
suspicion
and
deede
dawson
voice
was
very
soft
and
deadly
as
he
said
so
you
been
looking
in
the
bedrooms
have
you
what
did
you
find
there
nothing
sir
not
a
thing
protested
dunn
i
did
touch
a
thing
i
only
wanted
to
look
round
before
coming
down
here
to
see
about
the
and
the
attics
asked
deede
dawson
what
did
you
find
there
there
was
no
one
in
them
dunn
answered
i
only
wanted
to
make
sure
the
young
lady
was
telling
the
truth
about
there
being
no
servants
in
the
house
to
did
you
look
in
all
the
attics
then
asked
deede
dawson
yes
answered
dunn
was
one
as
was
locked
but
i
tooked
the
liberty
of
forcing
it
just
to
make
sure
i
ai
done
no
harm
to
speak
you
found
one
locked
eh
said
deede
dawson
and
his
smile
grew
still
more
pleasant
and
more
friendly
that
must
have
surprised
you
a
good
deal
did
it
i
thought
as
perhaps
there
was
some
one
waiting
already
to
give
the
alarm
answered
dunn
i
did
mind
the
old
lady
but
i
could
risk
there
being
some
one
hiding
there
so
i
had
to
look
but
i
ai
done
no
damage
to
speak
of
i
could
put
it
right
for
you
myself
in
sir
if
you
let
could
you
indeed
said
deede
dawson
well
and
did
you
find
any
one
sleeping
there
but
for
that
hairy
disguise
upon
his
cheeks
and
chin
dunn
would
almost
certainly
have
betrayed
himself
so
dreadful
did
the
question
seem
to
him
so
poignant
the
double
meaning
that
it
bore
so
clear
his
memory
of
his
friend
he
had
found
there
sleeping
indeed
but
there
was
nothing
to
show
his
inner
agitation
as
he
said
shaking
his
head
there
was
no
one
there
any
more
than
in
the
other
attics
nothing
but
an
old
and
what
said
deede
dawson
his
voice
so
soft
it
was
like
a
caress
his
smile
so
sweet
it
was
a
veritable
benediction
what
was
in
that
did
look
answered
dunn
and
then
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
as
though
all
at
once
understanding
what
previously
had
puzzled
him
he
cried
is
that
where
you
keep
the
silver
lor
and
to
think
i
never
even
troubled
to
you
never
looked
repeated
deede
dawson
dunn
shook
his
head
with
an
air
of
baffled
regret
never
thought
of
it
he
said
i
thought
it
was
just
lumber
like
in
the
other
attics
and
i
might
have
got
clear
away
with
it
if
i
had
known
as
easy
as
his
chagrin
was
so
apparent
his
whole
manner
so
innocent
that
deede
dawson
began
to
believe
he
really
did
know
nothing
did
you
wonder
why
the
door
was
locked
he
asked
lor
answered
dunn
if
you
stopped
to
wonder
about
everything
you
find
rummy
in
a
crib
you
cracking
when
would
you
ever
get
your
business
done
so
you
did
look
in
that
deede
dawson
repeated
if
i
had
answered
dunn
ruefully
i
should
be
here
copped
like
this
i
should
have
shoved
with
the
stuff
and
not
waited
for
nothing
more
but
i
never
had
no
i
not
so
sure
of
that
said
deede
dawson
grimly
and
as
he
spoke
a
soft
voice
called
down
from
upstairs
is
there
any
one
there
it
said
oh
please
is
any
one
there
is
that
you
ella
deede
dawson
called
back
come
down
i
ca
she
answered
i
fastened
to
a
i
did
hurt
the
young
lady
dunn
interposed
quickly
i
only
tied
her
up
as
gentle
as
i
could
to
a
chair
so
as
to
stop
her
from
oh
that
it
is
it
said
deede
dawson
and
seemed
a
little
amused
as
though
the
thought
of
his
stepdaughter
plight
pleased
him
rather
than
not
well
if
she
ca
come
down
here
we
go
up
there
turn
round
my
man
and
go
up
the
stairs
and
keep
your
hands
over
your
head
all
the
time
i
sha
hesitate
to
shoot
if
you
do
and
i
never
dunn
was
not
inclined
to
value
his
life
at
a
very
high
price
as
he
turned
and
went
awkwardly
up
the
stairs
still
holding
his
hands
above
his
head
but
he
meant
to
save
it
if
he
could
for
many
things
depended
on
it
among
them
due
punishment
to
be
exacted
for
the
crime
he
had
discovered
this
night
and
also
perhaps
for
the
humiliation
he
was
now
enduring
chapter
viii
captivity
captive
up
the
stairs
across
the
landing
and
down
the
passage
opposite
dunn
went
in
silence
shepherded
by
the
little
man
behind
whose
pistol
was
still
levelled
and
still
steady
his
hands
held
high
in
the
air
he
pushed
open
with
his
knee
the
door
of
the
girl
room
and
entered
and
she
looked
up
as
he
did
so
with
an
expression
of
pure
astonishment
at
his
attitude
of
upheld
hands
that
changed
to
one
of
comprehension
and
of
faint
amusement
as
deede
dawson
followed
revolver
in
hand
oh
she
murmured
captivity
captive
it
at
the
fireplace
dunn
turned
and
found
her
looking
at
him
very
intently
while
from
the
doorway
deede
dawson
surveyed
them
both
for
once
his
eyes
appearing
to
share
in
the
smile
that
played
about
his
lips
as
though
he
found
much
satisfaction
in
what
he
saw
well
ella
he
said
you
been
having
adventures
it
seems
but
you
do
look
too
comfortable
like
nor
do
i
feel
it
she
retorted
so
please
set
me
yes
so
i
will
he
answered
but
he
still
hesitated
and
dunn
had
the
idea
that
he
was
pleased
to
see
the
girl
like
this
and
would
leave
her
so
if
he
could
and
that
he
was
wondering
now
if
he
could
turn
her
predicament
to
his
own
advantage
in
any
way
yes
i
will
he
said
again
your
mother
she
has
wakened
ella
answered
i
do
think
she
has
heard
anything
i
do
suppose
she
will
for
she
took
two
of
those
pills
last
night
that
rawson
gave
her
for
when
she
could
it
just
as
well
she
did
said
deede
dawson
yes
but
please
undo
my
hands
she
asked
him
the
cords
are
cutting
my
wrists
as
she
spoke
she
glanced
at
dunn
standing
by
the
fireplace
and
listening
gravely
to
what
they
said
and
deede
dawson
exclaimed
with
an
air
of
great
indignation
the
fellow
deserves
to
be
well
thrashed
for
treating
you
like
that
i
a
good
mind
to
do
it
too
before
handing
him
over
to
the
but
you
have
released
me
yet
she
remarked
oh
yes
yes
he
said
starting
as
if
this
were
quite
a
new
idea
i
release
you
at
once
but
i
must
watch
this
scoundrel
he
must
have
frightened
you
indeed
he
did
not
she
answered
quickly
again
looking
at
dunn
no
he
did
she
said
again
with
a
touch
of
defiance
in
her
manner
and
a
certain
slightly
lifting
her
small
round
chin
at
least
not
much
after
just
at
first
she
added
i
loose
you
deede
dawson
said
once
more
and
coming
up
to
her
he
began
to
fumble
in
a
feeble
ineffectual
way
at
the
cords
that
secured
her
wrists
jove
he
tied
you
up
pretty
tight
ella
he
said
he
believes
in
doing
his
work
thoroughly
i
suppose
she
remarked
lifting
her
eyes
to
dunn
with
a
look
in
them
that
was
partly
questioning
and
partly
puzzled
and
wholly
elusive
i
daresay
he
always
likes
to
do
everything
seems
so
said
deede
dawson
giving
up
his
fumbling
and
ineffectual
efforts
to
release
her
he
stepped
back
and
stood
behind
her
chair
looking
from
her
to
dunn
and
back
again
and
once
more
dunn
was
conscious
of
an
impression
that
he
wished
to
make
use
for
his
own
purposes
of
the
girl
position
but
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
do
so
you
are
a
nice
scoundrel
said
deede
dawson
suddenly
with
an
indignation
that
seemed
to
dunn
largely
assumed
treating
a
girl
like
this
ella
what
would
you
like
done
to
him
he
deserves
shooting
shall
i
put
a
bullet
through
him
for
you
he
might
have
treated
me
worse
i
suppose
said
ella
quietly
and
if
you
would
be
less
indignant
with
him
you
might
be
more
help
to
me
there
are
scissors
on
the
table
i
get
them
deede
dawson
said
i
get
them
he
repeated
as
though
now
at
last
finally
making
up
his
mind
he
took
the
scissors
from
the
where
they
lay
before
the
and
cut
the
cords
by
which
ella
was
secured
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
straightened
herself
from
the
confined
position
in
which
she
had
been
held
and
began
to
rub
her
wrists
which
were
slightly
inflamed
where
the
cords
had
bruised
her
soft
skin
like
to
tie
him
up
that
way
now
asked
deede
dawson
you
shall
if
you
she
turned
and
looked
full
at
dunn
and
he
looked
back
at
her
with
eyes
as
steady
and
as
calm
as
her
own
again
she
showed
that
faint
doubt
and
wonder
which
had
flickered
through
her
level
gaze
before
as
though
she
felt
that
there
was
more
in
all
this
than
was
apparent
and
did
not
wish
to
condemn
him
utterly
without
a
hearing
but
it
was
plain
also
that
she
did
not
wish
to
say
too
much
before
her
stepfather
and
she
answered
carelessly
i
do
think
i
could
tie
him
tight
enough
besides
he
looks
ridiculous
enough
like
that
with
his
hands
up
in
the
it
was
her
revenge
for
what
he
had
made
her
suffer
he
felt
himself
flush
and
he
knew
that
she
knew
that
her
little
barbed
shaft
had
struck
home
well
go
and
look
through
his
pockets
deede
dawson
said
and
see
if
he
got
a
revolver
do
be
frightened
if
he
lowers
his
hands
be
a
dead
man
before
he
knows
he
has
a
pistol
she
said
he
showed
it
me
it
in
his
coat
better
get
it
then
deede
dawson
told
her
she
obeyed
and
brought
him
the
weapon
and
he
nodded
with
satisfaction
as
he
put
it
in
his
own
pocket
i
think
we
might
let
you
put
your
hands
down
now
he
remarked
and
dunn
gladly
availed
himself
of
the
permission
for
every
muscle
in
his
arms
was
aching
badly
he
remained
standing
by
the
wall
while
deede
dawson
seating
himself
on
the
chair
to
which
ella
had
been
bound
rested
his
chin
on
his
left
hand
and
with
the
pistol
still
ready
in
his
right
regarded
dunn
with
a
steady
questioning
gaze
ella
was
standing
near
the
bed
she
had
poured
a
few
drops
of
on
her
wrists
and
was
rubbing
them
softly
and
for
ever
after
the
poignant
pleasant
odour
of
the
scent
has
remained
associated
in
robert
dunn
mind
with
the
strange
events
of
that
night
so
that
always
even
the
merest
whiff
of
it
conjures
up
before
his
mind
a
picture
of
that
room
with
himself
silent
by
the
fireplace
and
ella
silent
by
the
bed
and
deede
dawson
pistol
in
hand
seated
between
them
as
silent
also
as
they
and
very
watchful
ella
appeared
fully
taken
up
with
her
occupation
and
might
almost
have
forgotten
the
presence
of
the
two
men
she
did
not
look
at
either
of
them
but
continued
to
rub
and
chafe
her
wrists
softly
deede
dawson
had
forgotten
for
once
to
smile
his
brow
was
slightly
wrinkled
his
cold
grey
eyes
intent
and
watchful
and
dunn
felt
very
sure
that
he
was
thinking
out
some
plan
or
scheme
the
hope
came
to
him
that
deede
dawson
was
thinking
he
might
prove
of
use
and
that
was
the
thought
which
above
all
others
he
wished
the
other
to
have
it
was
indeed
that
thought
which
all
his
recent
actions
had
been
aimed
to
implant
in
deede
dawson
mind
till
his
dreadful
discovery
in
the
attic
had
seemed
to
make
at
last
direct
action
possible
how
in
his
present
plight
that
thought
if
deede
dawson
should
come
to
entertain
it
might
yet
prove
his
salvation
now
and
again
deede
dawson
gave
him
quick
searching
glances
but
when
at
last
he
spoke
it
was
ella
he
addressed
wrists
hurt
you
much
he
asked
not
so
much
now
she
answered
they
were
beginning
to
hurt
a
great
deal
were
they
though
said
deede
dawson
and
to
think
you
might
have
been
like
that
for
hours
if
i
had
chanced
to
come
home
too
bad
what
a
brute
this
fellow
men
mostly
are
i
think
she
observed
indifferently
and
women
mostly
like
to
get
their
own
back
again
he
remarked
with
a
chuckle
and
then
turned
sharply
to
dunn
well
my
man
he
asked
what
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
nothing
dunn
answered
it
was
a
fair
you
had
a
taste
of
penal
servitude
before
i
suppose
deede
dawson
asked
maybe
dunn
answered
as
if
not
wishing
to
betray
himself
maybe
well
i
think
i
remember
you
said
something
about
not
being
long
out
of
dartmoor
remarked
deede
dawson
how
do
you
relish
the
prospect
of
going
back
there
i
wonder
interposed
ella
thoughtfully
i
wonder
what
it
is
in
you
that
makes
you
so
love
to
be
cruel
father
eh
what
he
exclaimed
quite
surprised
who
being
cruel
you
she
answered
you
enjoy
keeping
him
wondering
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
him
just
as
you
enjoyed
seeing
me
tied
to
that
chair
and
would
have
liked
to
leave
me
my
dear
ella
he
protested
my
dear
child
oh
i
know
she
said
wearily
why
do
you
hand
the
man
over
to
the
police
if
you
going
to
or
let
him
go
at
once
if
you
mean
to
do
that
let
him
go
indeed
exclaimed
deede
dawson
what
an
idea
what
should
i
do
that
for
if
you
give
me
another
chance
said
dunn
quickly
i
do
anything
i
should
get
it
pretty
stiff
for
this
lot
and
that
be
any
use
to
you
sir
would
it
i
can
do
almost
anything
garden
drive
a
motor
do
what
i
told
it
only
because
i
never
had
a
chance
i
had
to
take
to
this
if
you
could
do
what
you
told
you
certainly
might
be
useful
said
deede
dawson
slowly
and
i
do
know
that
it
would
do
me
any
good
to
send
you
off
to
prison
you
deserve
it
of
course
still
you
talk
sometimes
like
an
educated
man
i
had
a
bit
of
education
dunn
answered
i
see
said
deede
dawson
well
i
wo
ask
you
any
more
questions
you
probably
only
lie
what
your
name
with
that
sudden
recklessness
which
was
a
part
of
his
impulsive
and
passionate
nature
dunn
answered
charley
the
effect
was
instantaneous
and
apparent
on
both
his
auditors
ella
gave
a
little
cry
and
started
so
violently
that
she
dropped
the
bottle
of
she
had
in
her
hands
deede
dawson
jumped
to
his
feet
with
a
fearful
oath
his
face
went
livid
his
fat
cheeks
seemed
suddenly
to
sag
of
his
perpetual
smile
every
trace
vanished
he
swung
his
revolver
up
and
dunn
saw
the
crooked
forefinger
quiver
as
though
in
the
very
act
of
pressing
the
trigger
the
pressure
of
a
hair
decided
indeed
whether
the
weapon
was
to
fire
or
not
as
in
a
stammering
voice
deede
dawson
gasped
what
what
do
you
mean
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
only
told
you
my
name
dunn
answered
what
wrong
with
it
doubtful
and
afraid
deede
dawson
stood
hesitant
his
forehead
had
become
very
damp
and
he
wiped
it
with
a
nervous
gesture
is
that
your
name
your
real
name
he
muttered
never
had
another
that
i
know
of
dunn
answered
deede
dawson
sat
down
again
on
the
chair
he
was
still
plainly
very
disturbed
and
shaken
and
ella
seemed
scarcely
less
agitated
though
dunn
watching
them
both
very
keenly
noticed
that
she
was
now
looking
at
deede
dawson
with
a
somewhat
strange
expression
and
with
an
air
as
though
his
extreme
excitement
puzzled
her
and
made
her
afraid
nothing
wrong
with
the
name
is
there
dunn
muttered
again
no
no
deede
dawson
answered
no
it
merely
a
coincidence
all
a
coincidence
i
suppose
ella
ella
did
not
answer
her
expression
was
very
troubled
and
full
of
doubt
as
she
stood
looking
from
her
stepfather
to
dunn
and
back
again
it
only
that
your
name
happens
to
be
the
same
as
that
of
a
friend
of
ours
a
great
friend
of
my
daughter
deede
dawson
said
as
though
he
felt
obliged
to
offer
some
explanation
that
all
a
coincidence
it
startled
me
for
the
he
laughed
that
all
well
my
man
it
happens
there
is
something
i
can
make
you
useful
in
if
you
do
prove
useful
and
do
what
i
tell
you
perhaps
you
may
get
let
off
i
might
even
keep
you
on
in
a
job
i
wo
say
i
will
but
i
might
you
look
a
likely
sort
of
fellow
for
work
and
i
daresay
you
are
any
more
dishonest
than
most
people
funny
how
things
happen
quite
a
coincidence
your
name
well
come
on
it
that
you
saw
in
the
attic
upstairs
i
want
you
to
help
me
downstairs
with
that
charley
chapter
ix
the
attic
of
mystery
robert
dunn
was
by
no
means
sure
that
he
was
not
going
to
his
death
as
he
went
out
of
ella
room
on
his
way
to
the
attics
above
for
he
had
perceived
a
certain
doubt
and
suspicion
in
deede
dawson
manner
and
he
thought
it
very
likely
that
a
fatal
intention
lay
behind
but
he
obeyed
with
a
brisk
promptitude
of
manner
like
one
who
saw
a
prospect
of
escape
opening
before
him
and
as
he
went
he
saw
that
ella
had
relapsed
into
her
former
indifference
and
was
once
more
giving
all
her
attention
to
bathing
her
wrists
with
and
he
saw
too
that
deede
dawson
following
close
behind
kept
always
his
revolver
ready
perhaps
he
only
wants
to
get
me
out
of
her
way
before
he
shoots
he
reflected
perhaps
there
is
room
in
that
for
two
it
will
be
strange
to
die
shall
i
try
to
rush
him
but
he
would
shoot
at
once
and
i
should
have
a
chance
one
thing
if
anything
happens
to
me
no
one
will
ever
know
what
become
of
poor
and
this
seemed
to
him
a
great
pity
so
that
he
began
to
form
confused
and
foolish
plans
for
securing
that
his
friend
fate
should
become
known
with
a
sudden
start
for
he
had
not
known
he
was
there
he
found
himself
standing
on
the
threshold
of
that
attic
of
death
it
was
quite
dark
up
here
and
from
behind
deede
dawson
voice
told
him
impatiently
to
enter
he
obeyed
wondering
if
ever
again
he
would
cross
that
threshold
alive
and
deede
dawson
followed
him
into
the
dark
attic
so
that
dunn
was
appalled
by
the
man
rashness
for
how
could
he
tell
that
his
victim
would
not
take
this
opportunity
to
rise
up
from
the
place
where
he
had
been
thrust
and
take
his
revenge
what
an
idea
he
thought
to
himself
i
must
be
going
dotty
it
the
strain
of
expecting
a
bullet
in
my
back
all
the
time
i
suppose
i
was
never
like
this
deede
dawson
struck
a
match
and
put
it
to
a
that
lighted
up
the
whole
room
between
him
and
dunn
lay
the
and
dunn
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
still
there
and
that
nothing
had
changed
or
moved
and
then
again
he
said
to
himself
that
this
was
a
foolish
thought
only
worthy
of
some
excitable
hysterical
girl
it
being
too
much
for
me
he
thought
resignedly
i
heard
of
people
being
driven
mad
by
horror
i
suppose
that
what
happening
to
you
look
queer
deede
dawson
voice
interrupted
the
confused
medley
of
his
thoughts
why
do
you
look
like
that
charley
wright
dunn
looked
moodily
across
the
case
in
which
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
was
hidden
to
where
the
murderer
stood
after
a
pause
and
speaking
with
an
effort
he
said
you
look
queer
if
some
one
with
a
pistol
was
watching
you
all
the
time
the
way
you
watch
you
do
what
i
tell
you
and
you
be
all
right
deede
dawson
answered
you
see
that
dunn
nodded
it
big
enough
he
said
would
you
like
to
know
asked
deede
dawson
slowly
with
his
slow
perpetual
smile
would
you
like
to
know
what
in
it
charley
wright
and
again
dunn
was
certain
that
a
faint
suspicion
hung
about
those
last
two
words
and
that
his
life
and
death
hung
very
evenly
in
the
balance
silver
you
said
he
muttered
did
you
ah
yes
yes
to
be
sure
answered
deede
dawson
yes
so
i
did
silver
i
want
the
lid
nailed
down
there
a
hammer
and
nails
there
get
to
work
and
look
dunn
stepped
forward
and
began
to
set
about
a
task
that
was
so
terrible
and
strange
and
that
yet
he
had
at
peril
of
his
life
at
peril
of
more
than
that
indeed
to
treat
as
of
small
importance
standing
a
little
distance
from
the
lighted
deede
dawson
watched
him
narrowly
and
as
dunn
worked
he
was
very
sure
that
to
betray
the
least
sign
of
his
knowledge
would
be
to
bring
instantly
a
bullet
crashing
through
his
brain
it
seemed
curious
to
him
that
he
had
so
carefully
replaced
everything
after
making
his
discovery
and
that
without
any
forethought
or
special
intention
he
had
put
back
everything
so
exactly
as
he
had
found
it
when
the
slightest
neglect
or
failure
in
that
respect
would
most
certainly
have
cost
him
his
life
and
he
felt
that
as
yet
he
could
not
afford
to
die
one
by
one
he
drove
in
the
nails
and
as
he
worked
at
his
gruesome
task
he
heard
the
faintest
rustle
on
the
landing
without
the
faintest
sound
of
a
soft
breath
cautiously
drawn
in
of
a
light
foot
very
carefully
set
down
deede
dawson
plainly
heard
nothing
indeed
no
ear
less
acute
and
less
than
dunn
could
have
caught
sounds
that
were
so
slight
and
low
but
he
listening
between
each
stroke
of
his
hammer
was
sure
that
it
was
ella
who
had
followed
them
and
that
she
crouched
upon
the
landing
without
watching
and
listening
did
that
mean
he
wondered
that
she
too
knew
or
was
it
merely
natural
curiosity
hostile
in
part
perhaps
since
evidently
the
relations
between
her
and
her
stepfather
were
not
too
friendly
a
desire
to
know
what
task
there
could
be
in
the
attics
so
late
at
night
for
which
deede
dawson
had
such
need
of
his
captive
help
or
was
it
by
any
chance
because
she
wished
to
know
how
things
went
with
him
and
what
was
to
be
his
fate
in
any
case
dunn
was
sure
that
ella
had
followed
then
and
was
on
the
landing
without
he
drove
home
the
last
nail
and
stood
up
that
done
he
said
and
well
done
said
deede
dawson
well
done
charley
he
spoke
the
name
softly
and
lingeringly
and
then
all
at
once
he
began
to
laugh
a
low
and
somewhat
dreadful
laughter
that
had
in
it
no
mirth
at
all
and
that
sounded
horrible
and
strange
in
the
chill
emptiness
of
the
attic
leaning
one
hand
on
the
that
served
as
the
coffin
of
his
dead
friend
dunn
swore
a
silent
oath
to
exact
full
retribution
and
henceforth
to
put
that
purpose
on
a
level
with
the
mission
on
which
originally
he
had
come
aloud
and
in
a
grumbling
tone
he
said
what
the
matter
with
my
name
it
a
name
like
any
other
wrong
with
it
what
should
there
be
flashed
deede
dawson
in
reply
i
do
know
dunn
answered
you
keep
repeating
it
so
that
it
a
very
good
name
deede
dawson
said
an
excellent
name
but
it
not
suitable
not
he
began
to
laugh
again
and
then
stopped
abruptly
do
you
know
i
think
you
had
better
choose
another
he
said
it
all
one
to
me
declared
dunn
if
charley
wright
do
suit
how
will
robert
dunn
do
i
knew
a
man
of
that
name
it
a
better
name
than
charley
wright
said
deede
dawson
we
call
you
robert
dunn
charley
wright
do
you
know
why
i
ca
have
you
call
yourself
charley
wight
dunn
shook
his
head
because
i
do
like
it
said
deede
dawson
why
that
a
name
that
would
drive
me
mad
he
muttered
half
to
himself
dunn
did
not
speak
but
he
thought
this
was
a
strange
thing
for
the
other
to
say
and
showed
that
even
he
cold
and
remorseless
and
without
any
natural
feeling
as
he
had
seemed
to
be
yet
had
about
him
still
some
touch
of
humanity
and
as
he
mused
on
this
which
seemed
to
him
so
strange
though
really
it
was
not
strange
at
all
his
attentive
ears
caught
the
sound
of
a
soft
step
without
beginning
to
descend
the
stairs
had
that
name
then
been
more
than
she
also
could
bear
if
so
she
must
know
i
do
see
why
i
do
see
what
wrong
with
it
he
said
aloud
but
robert
dunn
will
suit
me
just
as
all
a
matter
of
taste
said
deede
dawson
his
manner
more
composed
and
natural
again
it
a
funny
thing
now
suppose
my
name
was
charley
wright
then
there
would
be
two
charley
wrights
in
this
attic
eh
a
coincidence
that
would
be
i
suppose
so
answered
dunn
i
knew
another
man
named
charley
wright
did
you
where
he
oh
he
dead
answered
dunn
deede
dawson
could
not
repress
the
start
he
gave
and
for
a
moment
dunn
thought
that
his
suspicions
were
really
roused
he
came
a
little
nearer
his
pistol
still
ready
in
his
hand
dead
is
he
he
said
that
a
pity
he
not
here
then
but
it
would
be
funny
would
it
if
there
were
two
charley
wrights
in
one
room
i
do
know
what
you
mean
dunn
answered
i
think
there
are
lots
of
funnier
things
than
that
would
that
where
you
wrong
retorted
deede
dawson
and
he
laughed
again
shrilly
and
dreadfully
a
laughter
that
had
in
it
anything
but
mirth
can
you
carry
that
downstairs
if
i
help
you
get
it
on
your
shoulder
he
asked
abruptly
it
heavy
but
i
might
dunn
answered
he
supposed
that
now
it
was
about
to
be
hidden
somewhere
and
he
felt
that
he
must
know
where
since
that
knowledge
would
mean
everything
and
enable
him
to
set
the
authorities
to
work
at
once
immediately
he
could
communicate
with
them
the
weight
of
the
thing
taxed
even
his
great
strength
to
the
utmost
but
he
managed
it
somehow
and
bending
beneath
his
burden
he
descended
the
stairs
to
the
hall
and
then
following
the
orders
deede
dawson
gave
him
from
behind
out
into
the
open
air
he
was
nearly
exhausted
when
at
last
his
told
him
he
could
put
it
down
as
he
stood
still
for
a
minute
or
two
to
recover
his
breath
and
strength
the
night
was
not
very
dark
for
a
young
moon
was
shining
in
a
clear
sky
and
it
appeared
to
dunn
as
he
felt
his
strength
returning
that
now
at
last
he
might
find
an
opportunity
of
making
an
attack
upon
his
captor
with
some
chance
of
success
hitherto
in
the
house
in
the
bright
glare
of
the
gas
lights
he
had
known
that
the
first
suspicious
movement
he
made
would
have
ensured
his
being
instantly
and
remorselessly
shot
down
his
mission
unfulfilled
but
here
in
the
open
air
in
the
night
that
the
moon
illumined
but
faintly
it
was
different
and
as
he
watched
for
his
opportunity
he
felt
that
sooner
or
later
it
was
sure
to
come
but
deede
dawson
was
alert
and
wary
his
pistol
never
left
his
hand
he
kept
so
well
on
his
guard
he
gave
dunn
no
opening
to
take
him
unawares
and
dunn
did
not
wish
to
run
too
desperate
a
chance
since
he
was
sure
that
sooner
or
later
one
giving
fair
chance
of
success
would
present
itself
do
you
want
it
carried
any
further
he
asked
it
very
i
suppose
you
mean
you
wondering
what
in
it
said
deede
dawson
sharply
it
nothing
to
me
what
in
it
silver
or
anything
else
retorted
dunn
do
you
want
me
to
carry
it
further
that
all
i
asked
no
answered
deede
dawson
no
i
do
do
you
know
if
you
knew
what
was
really
in
it
you
be
surprised
very
likely
answered
dunn
why
not
yes
you
would
be
surprised
deede
dawson
repeated
and
suddenly
shouted
into
the
darkness
are
you
ready
are
you
ready
there
dunn
was
very
startled
for
somehow
he
had
supposed
all
along
that
deede
dawson
was
quite
alone
there
was
no
answer
to
his
call
but
after
a
minute
or
two
there
was
the
sound
of
a
engine
starting
and
then
a
big
car
came
gliding
forward
and
stopped
in
front
of
them
driven
by
a
form
so
muffled
in
coats
and
coverings
as
to
be
indistinguishable
in
that
faint
light
put
the
case
inside
deede
dawson
said
i
help
with
some
trouble
they
succeeded
in
getting
the
case
in
and
deede
dawson
covered
it
carefully
with
a
big
rug
when
he
had
done
so
he
stepped
back
ready
ella
he
said
yes
answered
the
girl
soft
and
low
voice
that
already
dunn
could
have
sworn
to
amidst
a
thousand
others
chapter
x
the
new
gardener
go
ahead
then
said
deede
dawson
and
the
great
car
with
its
terrible
burden
shot
away
into
the
night
for
a
moment
or
two
deede
dawson
stood
looking
after
it
and
then
he
turned
and
walked
slowly
towards
the
house
and
mechanically
dunn
followed
the
sole
thought
in
his
mind
the
one
idea
of
which
he
was
conscious
that
of
ella
driving
away
into
the
darkness
with
the
dead
body
of
his
murdered
friend
in
the
car
behind
her
did
she
know
he
asked
himself
or
was
she
ignorant
of
what
it
was
she
had
with
her
it
seemed
to
him
that
that
question
hammering
itself
so
awfully
upon
his
mind
and
clamouring
for
an
answer
must
soon
send
him
mad
and
still
before
him
floated
perpetually
a
picture
of
long
dark
lonely
roads
of
a
rushing
driven
by
a
lovely
girl
of
the
awful
thing
hidden
in
the
car
behind
her
dully
he
recognized
that
the
opportunity
for
which
he
had
watched
and
waited
so
patiently
had
come
and
gone
a
dozen
times
for
deede
dawson
had
now
quite
relaxed
his
former
wary
care
it
was
as
though
he
supposed
all
danger
over
as
though
in
the
reaction
after
an
enormous
strain
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
immediate
relief
he
hardly
gave
a
single
glance
at
dunn
whose
faintest
movement
before
had
never
escaped
him
he
had
even
put
his
pistol
back
in
his
pocket
and
at
almost
any
moment
dunn
with
his
unusual
strength
and
agility
could
have
seized
and
mastered
him
but
for
such
an
enterprise
dunn
had
no
longer
any
spirit
for
all
his
mind
was
taken
up
by
that
one
picture
so
clear
in
his
thoughts
of
ella
in
her
great
car
driving
the
dead
man
through
the
night
she
must
know
he
said
to
himself
she
must
or
she
would
never
have
gone
off
like
that
at
that
time
she
ca
know
it
impossible
or
she
would
never
have
and
again
it
seemed
to
him
that
this
doubt
was
driving
him
mad
deede
dawson
entered
the
house
and
got
a
bottle
of
whisky
and
a
syphon
of
and
mixed
himself
a
drink
for
the
first
time
since
departure
he
seemed
to
remember
dunn
presence
oh
there
you
are
he
said
dunn
did
not
answer
he
stood
moodily
on
the
threshold
wondering
why
he
did
not
rush
upon
the
other
and
with
his
knee
upon
his
chest
his
hands
about
his
throat
force
him
to
answer
the
question
that
was
still
whispering
shouting
screaming
itself
into
his
ears
does
she
know
what
it
is
she
drives
with
her
on
that
big
car
through
the
black
and
lonely
night
like
a
drink
asked
deede
dawson
dunn
shook
his
head
and
it
came
to
him
that
he
did
not
attack
deede
dawson
and
force
the
truth
from
him
because
he
dared
not
because
he
was
afraid
because
he
feared
what
the
answer
might
be
there
a
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
deede
dawson
said
to
him
you
can
sleep
there
tonight
you
find
some
sacks
you
can
make
a
bed
without
a
word
in
reply
dunn
turned
and
stumbled
away
he
felt
very
tired
physically
exhausted
and
the
idea
of
a
bed
even
of
sacks
in
an
outhouse
became
all
at
once
extraordinarily
attractive
he
found
the
place
without
difficulty
and
making
a
pile
of
the
sacks
flung
himself
down
on
them
and
was
asleep
almost
at
once
but
almost
as
promptly
he
awoke
again
for
he
had
dreamed
of
ella
driving
her
car
through
the
night
towards
some
strange
peril
from
which
in
his
dream
he
was
trying
frantically
and
ineffectively
to
save
her
when
he
awoke
so
it
was
all
through
the
night
his
utter
and
complete
exhaustion
compelled
him
to
sleep
and
every
time
some
fresh
fantastic
dream
in
which
ella
and
the
huge
and
the
dreadful
burden
she
had
with
her
always
figured
awoke
him
with
a
fresh
start
but
towards
morning
he
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
from
which
presently
he
awoke
to
find
it
broad
daylight
and
deede
dawson
standing
on
the
threshold
of
the
shed
with
his
perpetually
smiling
lips
and
his
cold
unsmiling
eyes
well
my
man
had
a
good
sleep
he
said
i
was
tired
dunn
answered
yes
we
had
a
busy
night
agreed
deede
dawson
i
slept
well
too
i
been
wondering
what
to
do
with
you
of
course
i
ought
to
hand
you
over
to
the
police
and
it
rather
a
risk
taking
on
a
man
of
your
character
but
i
decided
to
give
you
a
chance
probably
you
misuse
it
but
i
give
you
an
opportunity
as
gardener
and
chauffeur
here
you
can
drive
a
car
you
say
dunn
nodded
that
all
right
said
deede
dawson
you
shall
have
your
board
and
lodging
and
i
get
you
some
decent
clothes
instead
of
those
rags
and
if
you
prove
satisfactory
and
make
yourself
useful
you
find
i
can
pay
well
there
will
be
plenty
of
chances
for
you
to
make
a
little
money
if
you
know
how
to
take
when
it
money
growled
dunn
you
give
me
the
chance
and
i
think
added
deede
dawson
i
think
it
might
improve
your
looks
if
you
dunn
passed
his
hand
over
the
tangle
of
hair
that
hid
his
features
so
effectually
what
for
he
asked
oh
well
please
yourself
answered
deede
dawson
i
do
know
that
it
matters
and
perhaps
you
have
reasons
of
your
own
for
preferring
a
beard
come
on
up
to
the
house
now
and
i
tell
dawson
to
give
you
some
breakfast
and
you
might
as
well
have
a
wash
too
perhaps
unless
you
object
to
that
as
well
as
to
dunn
rose
without
answering
made
his
toilet
by
shaking
off
some
of
the
dust
that
clung
to
him
and
followed
his
new
employer
out
of
the
into
the
open
air
it
was
a
fresh
and
lovely
morning
and
coming
towards
them
down
one
of
the
garden
paths
was
ella
looking
as
fresh
and
lovely
as
the
morning
in
a
dainty
cotton
frock
with
lace
at
her
throat
and
wrists
that
she
could
possibly
have
spent
the
night
tearing
across
country
in
a
powerful
car
conveying
a
dead
man
to
an
unknown
destination
appeared
to
dunn
a
clean
impossibility
and
for
a
moment
he
almost
supposed
he
had
been
mistaken
in
thinking
he
recognized
her
voice
but
he
knew
he
had
not
that
he
had
made
no
mistake
that
it
had
indeed
been
ella
he
had
seen
dash
away
into
the
darkness
on
her
strange
and
terrible
errand
oh
my
daughter
said
deede
dawson
carelessly
noticing
surprise
oh
yes
she
back
you
did
expect
to
see
her
this
morning
well
ella
dunn
surprised
to
see
you
back
so
soon
you
dunn
dunn
did
not
answer
for
a
kind
of
vertigo
of
horror
had
come
upon
him
and
for
a
moment
all
things
revolved
about
him
in
a
whirling
circle
wherein
the
one
fixed
point
was
ella
gentle
lovely
face
that
sometimes
he
thought
had
a
small
round
hole
with
blue
edges
in
the
very
centre
of
the
forehead
above
the
nose
it
was
her
voice
clear
and
a
little
loud
that
called
him
back
to
himself
he
not
well
she
was
saying
he
going
to
i
all
right
he
muttered
it
was
nothing
nothing
it
only
that
i
had
nothing
to
eat
for
so
oh
poor
man
exclaimed
ella
come
up
to
the
house
deede
dawson
said
breakfast
ready
ella
said
mother
told
me
to
find
has
the
woman
come
yet
deede
dawson
asked
if
she
has
you
might
tell
her
to
give
dunn
some
breakfast
i
just
been
telling
him
willing
to
give
him
another
chance
and
to
take
him
on
as
gardener
and
chauffeur
so
you
can
keep
an
eye
on
him
and
see
if
he
works
ella
was
silent
for
a
moment
but
her
expression
was
grave
and
a
little
puzzled
as
though
she
did
not
quite
understand
this
and
wondered
what
it
meant
and
when
she
looked
up
at
her
stepfather
dunn
was
certain
there
was
both
distrust
and
suspicion
in
her
manner
i
suppose
she
said
then
last
night
seemed
to
you
a
good
recommendation
as
she
spoke
she
glanced
at
her
wrists
where
the
bruises
still
showed
and
deede
dawson
smile
broadened
one
should
always
be
ready
to
give
another
chance
to
a
poor
fellow
who
down
he
said
he
may
run
straight
now
he
got
an
opportunity
i
told
him
he
had
better
shave
but
he
seems
to
think
a
beard
suits
him
best
what
do
you
say
breakfast
waiting
ella
answered
turning
away
without
taking
any
notice
of
the
question
i
go
in
then
said
deede
dawson
you
might
show
dunn
the
way
to
the
kitchen
his
name
robert
dunn
by
the
way
and
tell
barker
to
give
him
something
to
i
should
think
he
could
find
his
way
there
himself
ella
remarked
but
though
she
made
this
protest
she
obeyed
at
once
for
though
she
used
a
considerable
liberty
of
speech
to
her
stepfather
it
was
none
the
less
evident
that
she
was
very
much
afraid
of
him
and
would
not
be
very
likely
to
disobey
him
or
oppose
him
directly
this
way
she
said
to
dunn
and
walked
on
along
a
path
that
led
to
the
back
of
the
house
once
she
stopped
and
looked
back
she
smiled
slightly
and
disdainfully
as
she
did
so
and
dunn
saw
that
she
was
looking
at
a
clump
of
small
bushes
near
where
they
had
been
standing
he
guessed
at
once
that
she
believed
deede
dawson
to
be
behind
those
bushes
watching
them
and
when
she
glanced
at
him
he
understood
that
she
wished
him
to
know
it
also
he
said
nothing
though
a
faint
movement
visible
in
the
bushes
convinced
him
that
her
suspicions
if
indeed
she
had
them
were
and
they
walked
on
in
silence
ella
a
little
ahead
and
dunn
a
step
or
two
behind
the
garden
was
a
large
one
and
had
at
one
time
been
well
cultivated
but
now
it
was
neglected
and
overgrown
it
struck
dunn
that
if
he
was
to
be
the
gardener
here
he
would
certainly
not
find
himself
short
of
work
and
ella
without
looking
round
said
to
him
over
her
shoulder
do
you
know
anything
about
gardening
a
little
miss
he
answered
you
need
call
me
she
observed
when
a
man
has
tied
a
girl
to
a
chair
i
think
he
may
regard
himself
as
on
terms
of
some
familiarity
with
what
must
i
call
you
he
asked
and
his
words
bore
to
himself
a
double
meaning
for
indeed
what
name
was
it
by
which
he
ought
to
call
her
but
she
seemed
to
notice
nothing
as
she
answered
my
name
is
cayley
ella
cayley
you
can
call
me
miss
cayley
do
you
know
anything
of
motoring
yes
he
answered
though
i
never
cared
much
for
motoring
at
she
gave
him
a
quick
glance
but
said
no
more
and
they
came
almost
immediately
to
the
back
door
ella
opened
it
and
entered
nodding
to
him
to
follow
and
crossing
a
narrow
passage
she
entered
the
kitchen
where
a
tall
gaunt
elderly
woman
in
a
black
bonnet
and
a
course
apron
was
at
work
this
is
dunn
barker
she
called
raising
her
voice
he
is
the
new
gardener
will
you
give
him
some
breakfast
please
she
added
to
dunn
when
you
finished
you
can
go
to
the
garage
and
wash
the
car
and
when
you
speak
to
barker
you
must
shout
she
is
quite
deaf
that
is
why
my
stepfather
engaged
her
because
he
was
sorry
for
her
and
wanted
to
give
her
a
chance
you
know
chapter
xi
the
problem
when
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
and
after
he
had
had
the
wash
of
which
he
certainly
stood
in
considerable
need
dunn
made
his
way
to
the
garage
and
there
occupied
himself
cleaning
the
car
he
noticed
that
the
mud
with
which
it
was
liberally
covered
was
of
a
light
sandy
sort
and
he
discovered
on
one
of
the
tyres
a
small
shell
apparently
therefore
last
night
wild
journey
had
been
to
the
coast
and
it
was
a
natural
inference
that
the
sea
had
provided
a
secure
for
the
and
its
dreadful
contents
but
then
that
meant
that
there
was
no
evidence
left
on
which
he
could
take
action
as
he
busied
himself
with
his
task
he
tried
to
think
out
as
clearly
as
he
could
the
position
in
which
he
found
himself
and
to
decide
what
he
ought
to
do
next
to
his
quick
and
hasty
nature
the
swiftest
action
was
always
the
most
congenial
and
had
he
followed
his
instinct
he
would
have
lost
no
time
in
denouncing
deede
dawson
but
his
cooler
thoughts
told
him
that
he
dared
not
do
that
since
it
would
be
to
involve
risks
not
for
himself
but
for
others
that
he
simply
dared
not
contemplate
he
felt
that
the
police
even
if
they
credited
his
story
which
he
also
felt
that
very
likely
they
would
not
do
could
not
act
on
his
sole
evidence
and
even
if
they
did
act
and
did
arrest
deede
dawson
it
was
certain
no
jury
would
convict
on
so
strange
a
story
so
entirely
uncorroborated
the
only
result
would
be
to
strengthen
deede
dawson
position
by
the
warning
to
show
him
his
danger
and
to
give
him
the
opportunity
if
he
chose
to
use
it
of
disappearing
and
beginning
again
his
plots
and
plans
after
some
fresh
and
perhaps
more
deadly
fashion
whereas
at
present
he
mused
at
any
rate
i
here
and
he
seem
to
suspect
me
and
i
can
watch
and
wait
for
a
time
till
i
see
my
way
more
and
this
decision
he
came
to
was
a
great
relief
to
him
for
he
desired
very
greatly
to
know
more
before
he
acted
and
in
especial
to
find
out
for
certain
what
was
ella
position
in
all
this
it
was
deede
dawson
voice
that
broke
in
upon
his
meditations
ah
you
busy
he
said
that
right
i
like
to
see
a
man
working
hard
i
got
some
new
things
for
you
i
think
may
fit
fairly
well
and
dawson
is
going
to
get
one
of
the
attics
ready
for
you
to
sleep
very
good
sir
said
dunn
he
wondered
which
attic
was
to
be
assigned
to
him
and
if
it
would
be
that
one
in
which
he
had
found
his
friend
body
he
suspected
too
that
he
was
to
be
lodged
in
the
house
so
that
deede
dawson
might
watch
him
and
this
pleased
him
since
it
meant
that
he
in
his
turn
would
be
able
to
watch
deede
dawson
not
that
there
appeared
much
to
watch
for
the
days
passed
on
and
it
seemed
a
very
harmless
and
quiet
life
that
deede
dawson
lived
with
his
wife
and
stepdaughter
but
for
the
memory
burned
into
dunn
mind
of
what
he
had
seen
that
night
of
his
arrival
he
would
have
been
inclined
to
say
that
no
more
harmless
gentle
soul
existed
than
deede
dawson
but
as
it
was
the
man
very
gentleness
and
smiling
urbanity
filled
him
with
a
loathing
that
it
was
at
times
all
he
could
do
to
control
the
attic
assigned
to
him
to
sleep
in
was
that
where
he
had
made
his
dreadful
discovery
and
he
believed
this
had
been
done
as
a
further
test
of
his
ignorance
for
he
was
sure
deede
dawson
watched
him
closely
to
see
if
the
idea
of
being
there
was
in
any
way
repugnant
to
him
indeed
at
another
time
he
might
have
shrunk
from
the
idea
of
sleeping
each
night
in
the
very
room
where
his
friend
had
been
foully
done
to
death
but
now
he
derived
a
certain
grim
satisfaction
and
a
strengthening
of
his
nerves
for
the
task
that
lay
before
him
only
a
very
few
visitors
came
to
bittermeads
especially
now
that
john
clive
who
had
come
often
was
laid
up
but
one
or
two
of
the
people
from
the
village
came
occasionally
and
the
vicar
appeared
two
or
three
times
every
week
ostensibly
to
play
chess
with
deede
dawson
but
in
reality
dunn
thought
drawn
there
by
ella
who
however
seemed
quite
unaware
of
the
attraction
she
exercised
over
the
good
man
dunn
did
not
find
that
he
was
expected
to
do
very
much
work
and
in
fact
he
was
left
a
good
deal
to
himself
once
or
twice
the
car
was
taken
out
and
occasionally
deede
dawson
would
come
into
the
garden
and
chat
with
him
idly
for
a
few
minutes
on
indifferent
subjects
when
it
was
fine
he
would
often
bring
out
a
little
travelling
set
of
chessmen
and
board
and
proceed
to
amuse
himself
working
out
or
composing
problems
one
day
he
called
dunn
up
to
admire
a
problem
he
had
just
composed
pretty
clever
eh
he
said
admiring
his
own
work
with
much
complacence
quite
an
original
idea
of
mine
and
i
think
the
key
move
will
take
some
finding
what
do
you
say
i
suppose
you
do
play
chess
only
a
very
little
answered
dunn
try
a
game
with
me
said
deede
dawson
and
won
it
easily
for
in
fact
dunn
was
by
no
means
a
strong
player
his
swift
victory
appeared
to
delight
deede
dawson
immensely
a
very
pretty
mate
i
brought
off
there
against
you
he
declared
not
often
seen
a
prettier
now
you
try
to
solve
that
problem
of
mine
it
easy
enough
once
you
hit
on
the
key
dunn
thought
to
himself
that
there
were
other
and
more
important
problems
which
would
soon
be
solved
if
only
the
key
move
could
be
discovered
he
said
aloud
that
he
would
try
what
he
could
do
and
deede
dawson
promised
him
half
a
sovereign
if
he
solved
it
within
a
week
i
may
manage
it
within
a
week
said
dunn
i
do
say
i
will
but
sooner
or
later
i
shall
find
it
during
all
this
time
he
had
seen
little
of
ella
who
appeared
to
come
very
little
into
the
garden
and
who
when
she
did
so
avoided
him
in
a
somewhat
marked
manner
her
mother
dawson
was
a
little
faded
woman
with
timid
eyes
and
a
frightened
manner
her
health
did
not
seem
to
be
good
and
ella
looked
after
her
very
assiduously
that
she
went
in
deadly
fear
of
her
husband
was
fairly
evident
though
he
seemed
to
treat
her
always
with
great
consideration
and
kindness
and
even
with
a
show
of
affection
to
which
at
times
she
responded
and
from
which
at
other
times
she
appeared
to
shrink
with
inexplicable
terror
she
does
know
dunn
said
to
himself
but
she
suspects
ella
he
still
watched
with
the
same
care
and
secrecy
and
sometimes
he
seemed
to
see
her
walking
amidst
the
flowers
as
an
angel
of
sweetness
and
laughing
innocence
and
sometimes
he
saw
her
as
it
were
with
the
shadow
of
death
around
her
beauty
and
behind
her
gentle
eyes
and
winning
ways
a
great
and
horrible
abyss
of
one
thing
he
was
certain
her
mind
was
troubled
and
she
was
not
at
ease
and
it
was
plain
also
that
she
feared
her
smiling
stepfather
as
the
days
passed
too
dunn
grew
convinced
that
she
was
watching
him
all
the
time
even
when
she
seemed
most
indifferent
as
closely
and
as
intently
as
he
watched
her
all
watching
together
dunn
thought
grimly
it
would
be
simple
enough
i
suppose
if
one
could
hit
on
the
key
move
but
that
i
suppose
no
one
knows
but
deede
dawson
himself
one
thing
he
ca
very
well
be
up
to
any
fresh
mischief
while
he
lounging
about
here
like
this
i
suppose
he
is
simply
waiting
his
as
for
the
chess
problem
that
baffled
him
entirely
he
said
as
much
to
deede
dawson
who
was
very
pleased
but
would
not
tell
him
what
the
solution
was
no
no
find
it
out
for
yourself
he
said
chuckling
with
a
merriment
in
which
for
once
his
cold
eyes
seemed
to
take
full
share
i
go
on
trying
said
dunn
and
it
grew
to
be
quite
a
custom
between
them
for
deede
dawson
to
ask
him
how
he
was
getting
on
with
the
problem
and
for
dunn
to
reply
that
he
was
still
searching
for
the
key
move
several
times
little
errands
took
dunn
into
the
village
where
discreetly
listening
to
the
current
gossip
he
learned
that
john
clive
of
ramsdon
place
had
been
injured
in
an
attack
made
upon
him
by
a
gang
of
ferocious
poachers
at
least
a
dozen
in
number
but
was
making
good
progress
towards
recovery
also
he
found
that
john
clive
visits
to
bittermeads
had
not
gone
unremarked
or
wholly
uncriticized
since
there
was
a
vague
feeling
that
a
clive
of
ramsdon
place
ought
to
make
a
better
match
but
a
pretty
face
is
all
a
young
man
thinks
of
said
the
more
experienced
and
on
the
whole
it
seemed
to
be
felt
that
the
open
attention
clive
paid
to
ella
was
at
least
easily
to
be
understood
almost
the
first
visit
clive
paid
when
he
was
allowed
to
venture
out
was
to
bittermeads
and
dunn
returning
one
afternoon
from
an
errand
found
him
established
on
the
lawn
in
the
company
of
ella
and
looking
little
the
worse
for
his
adventure
he
and
ella
seemed
to
be
talking
very
animatedly
and
dunn
took
the
opportunity
to
busy
himself
with
some
gardening
work
not
far
away
so
that
he
could
watch
their
behaviour
he
told
himself
it
was
necessary
he
should
know
in
what
relation
they
stood
to
each
other
and
as
he
heard
them
chatting
and
laughing
together
with
great
apparent
friendliness
and
enjoyment
he
remembered
with
considerable
satisfaction
how
he
had
already
broken
one
rib
of
clive
and
he
wished
very
much
for
an
opportunity
to
break
another
for
without
knowing
why
he
was
beginning
to
conceive
an
intense
dislike
for
clive
and
also
it
did
not
seem
to
him
quite
good
taste
for
ella
to
sit
and
chat
and
laugh
with
him
so
readily
but
we
were
told
he
caught
a
stray
remark
of
ella
that
it
was
a
gang
of
at
least
a
dozen
that
attacked
no
answered
clive
reluctantly
no
i
think
there
was
only
one
but
he
had
a
grip
like
a
he
must
have
been
very
strong
remarked
ella
thoughtfully
i
would
give
fifty
pounds
to
meet
him
again
and
have
it
out
in
the
light
when
one
could
see
what
one
was
doing
declared
clive
with
great
vigour
oh
you
would
would
you
muttered
dunn
to
himself
well
one
of
these
days
i
may
claim
that
he
looked
round
at
clive
as
he
thought
this
and
clive
noticed
him
and
said
is
that
a
new
man
you
got
there
miss
cayley
does
he
rather
want
a
shave
where
on
earth
did
dawson
pick
him
up
oh
he
came
here
with
the
very
best
testimonials
and
father
engaged
him
on
the
spot
answered
ella
touching
her
wrists
thoughtfully
he
certainly
is
not
very
handsome
but
then
that
does
matter
does
it
she
spoke
more
loudly
than
usual
and
dunn
was
certain
she
did
so
in
order
that
he
might
hear
what
she
said
so
he
had
no
scruple
in
lingering
on
pretence
of
being
busy
with
a
rose
bush
and
heard
clive
say
well
if
he
were
one
of
my
chaps
i
should
tell
him
to
put
the
over
his
own
ella
laughed
amusedly
oh
what
an
idea
clive
she
cried
and
dunn
thought
to
himself
yes
one
day
i
shall
very
certainly
claim
that
fifty
chapter
xii
an
avowal
when
clive
had
gone
that
afternoon
ella
who
had
accompanied
him
as
far
as
the
gate
and
had
from
thence
waved
him
a
farewell
came
back
to
the
spot
where
dunn
was
working
she
stood
still
watching
him
and
he
looked
up
at
her
and
then
went
on
with
his
work
without
speaking
for
now
as
always
the
appalling
thought
was
perpetually
in
his
mind
must
she
not
have
known
what
it
was
she
had
with
her
in
the
car
when
she
went
driving
that
night
after
a
little
she
turned
away
as
if
disappointed
that
he
took
no
notice
of
her
presence
at
once
he
raised
himself
from
the
task
he
had
been
bending
over
and
stood
moodily
watching
the
slim
graceful
figure
about
which
hung
such
clouds
of
doubt
and
dread
and
she
turning
around
suddenly
as
if
she
actually
felt
the
impact
of
his
gaze
saw
him
and
saw
the
strange
expression
in
his
eyes
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
she
asked
quickly
her
soft
and
gentle
tones
a
little
shrill
as
though
swift
fear
had
come
upon
her
like
what
he
mumbled
oh
you
know
she
cried
passionately
am
i
to
be
the
next
she
asked
he
started
and
looked
at
her
wonderingly
asking
himself
if
these
words
of
hers
bore
the
grim
meaning
that
his
mind
instantly
gave
them
was
it
possible
that
if
she
did
know
something
of
what
was
going
on
in
this
quiet
country
house
during
these
peaceful
autumn
days
she
knew
it
not
as
willing
accomplice
but
as
a
helpless
destined
victim
who
saw
no
way
of
escape
as
if
she
feared
she
had
said
too
much
she
turned
and
began
to
walk
away
at
once
he
followed
stop
one
moment
he
exclaimed
miss
she
obeyed
turning
quickly
to
face
him
they
were
both
very
pale
and
both
were
under
the
influence
of
strong
excitement
but
between
them
there
hung
a
thick
cloud
of
doubt
and
dread
that
neither
could
penetrate
all
at
once
dunn
unable
to
control
himself
longer
burst
out
with
that
question
which
for
so
long
had
hovered
on
his
lips
do
you
know
he
said
do
you
know
what
you
took
away
with
you
in
the
car
that
night
i
came
here
the
you
meant
she
asked
of
course
i
do
i
helped
to
get
it
ready
what
the
matter
nothing
he
muttered
though
indeed
he
had
staggered
as
beneath
some
sudden
and
violent
blow
oh
did
you
he
said
with
an
effort
certainly
she
answered
now
i
answered
your
question
will
you
answer
me
one
why
did
you
tell
us
your
name
was
charley
wright
i
knew
a
man
of
that
name
once
he
answered
he
dead
i
thought
perhaps
she
said
slowly
and
quite
calmly
that
it
was
because
you
had
seen
the
name
written
on
a
photograph
in
my
no
it
was
that
he
answered
gravely
and
his
doubts
that
for
a
moment
had
seemed
so
terribly
confirmed
now
came
back
again
for
though
she
had
said
that
she
knew
of
the
contents
of
the
yet
if
that
were
really
so
how
was
it
conceivable
that
she
should
speak
of
such
a
thing
so
calmly
and
yet
again
if
she
could
do
it
perhaps
also
she
could
talk
of
it
without
emotion
once
more
there
was
fear
in
his
eyes
as
he
watched
her
and
her
own
were
troubled
and
doubtful
why
do
you
have
all
that
hair
on
your
face
she
asked
well
why
should
i
he
retorted
it
saves
does
it
she
said
do
you
know
what
it
looks
like
like
a
disguise
a
disguise
he
repeated
why
should
i
want
a
disguise
do
you
think
i
quite
a
fool
because
i
a
woman
she
asked
impatiently
do
you
suppose
i
could
see
very
well
when
you
came
that
night
that
you
were
not
an
ordinary
burglar
you
had
some
reason
of
your
own
for
breaking
into
this
house
what
was
it
i
tell
you
he
answered
if
you
tell
me
truly
what
was
in
that
oh
now
i
understand
she
cried
excitedly
it
was
to
find
that
out
you
came
and
then
dawson
made
you
help
us
get
it
away
that
was
he
did
not
speak
for
once
more
a
kind
of
horror
held
him
dumb
as
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
really
knew
she
saw
the
mingled
horror
and
bewilderment
in
his
eyes
and
she
laughed
lightly
as
though
that
amused
her
do
you
know
she
said
i
believe
i
guessed
as
much
from
the
first
but
i
afraid
dawson
was
too
clever
for
you
as
he
is
for
most
people
only
then
she
added
wrinkling
her
brows
as
though
a
new
point
puzzled
her
why
are
you
staying
here
like
this
ca
you
guess
that
too
he
asked
hoarsely
no
she
said
shaking
her
head
with
a
frankly
puzzled
air
no
i
ca
that
puzzled
me
all
the
time
do
you
know
i
think
you
ought
to
shave
why
a
beard
makes
a
good
disguise
she
answered
so
good
it
hardly
fair
for
you
to
have
it
when
i
perhaps
you
need
it
less
he
answered
bitterly
or
perhaps
no
disguise
could
be
so
effective
as
the
one
you
have
what
that
she
asked
bright
eyes
a
pretty
face
a
clear
complexion
he
answered
he
spoke
with
an
extreme
energy
and
bitterness
that
she
did
not
in
the
least
understand
and
that
quite
took
away
from
the
words
any
suspicion
of
intentional
rudeness
if
i
have
all
that
i
suppose
it
natural
and
not
a
disguise
she
remarked
my
beard
is
natural
too
he
retorted
all
the
same
i
wish
you
would
cut
it
off
she
answered
i
should
like
to
see
what
you
look
she
turned
and
walked
away
and
the
more
dunn
thought
over
this
conversation
the
less
he
felt
he
understood
it
what
had
she
meant
by
that
strange
start
and
look
she
had
given
him
when
she
had
asked
if
she
were
to
be
the
next
and
when
she
asserted
so
confidently
that
she
knew
what
was
in
the
was
that
true
or
was
she
speaking
under
some
mistaken
impression
or
had
she
wished
to
deceive
him
the
more
he
thought
the
more
disturbed
he
felt
and
every
hour
that
passed
he
seemed
to
feel
more
and
more
strongly
the
influence
of
her
gracious
beauty
the
horror
of
his
suspicions
of
her
the
next
day
clive
came
again
and
again
ella
seemed
very
pleased
to
see
him
and
again
dunn
hanging
about
in
their
vicinity
watched
gloomily
their
friendly
intercourse
that
clive
was
in
love
with
ella
seemed
fairly
certain
at
any
rate
he
showed
himself
strongly
attracted
by
her
and
very
eager
for
her
company
how
she
felt
was
more
doubtful
though
she
made
no
concealment
of
the
fact
that
she
liked
to
see
him
and
found
pleasure
in
having
him
there
dunn
moving
about
near
at
hand
was
aware
of
an
odd
impression
that
she
knew
he
was
watching
them
and
that
she
wished
him
to
do
so
for
several
times
he
saw
her
glance
in
his
direction
he
could
always
move
with
a
most
extraordinary
lightness
of
foot
so
that
big
and
clumsy
as
he
seemed
in
build
he
could
easily
go
unheard
and
even
unseen
and
john
clive
seemed
to
have
little
idea
that
he
remained
so
persistently
near
at
hand
this
gift
or
power
of
dunn
he
had
acquired
in
lands
where
life
may
easily
depend
on
the
snapping
of
a
twig
or
the
right
interpretation
of
a
trampled
and
he
was
using
it
now
almost
unconsciously
so
as
to
make
his
presence
near
ella
and
clive
as
unobtrusive
as
possible
when
his
keen
eye
caught
sight
of
a
bush
of
which
leaves
and
branches
were
moving
against
the
wind
for
that
he
knew
there
could
be
but
one
explanation
and
when
he
walked
round
so
as
to
get
behind
this
bush
he
was
not
surprised
to
see
deede
dawson
crouching
there
his
eyes
very
intent
and
eager
his
unsmiling
lips
drawn
back
to
show
his
white
teeth
in
a
threatening
grin
or
snarl
near
by
him
was
his
little
and
men
and
as
dunn
came
up
behind
he
looked
round
quickly
and
saw
him
for
a
moment
his
eyes
were
deadly
and
his
hand
dropped
to
his
where
dunn
had
reason
to
believe
he
carried
a
formidable
little
automatic
pistol
but
almost
at
once
his
expression
changed
and
with
a
gesture
he
invited
dunn
to
crouch
down
at
his
side
for
a
little
they
remained
like
this
and
then
deede
dawson
moved
cautiously
away
signing
to
dunn
to
follow
him
when
they
were
at
a
safe
distance
he
turned
to
dunn
and
said
is
he
serious
do
you
think
or
is
he
playing
with
her
i
make
him
pay
for
it
if
he
how
should
i
know
answered
dunn
quite
certain
it
was
no
such
anxiety
as
this
that
had
set
deede
dawson
watching
them
so
carefully
deede
dawson
seemed
to
feel
that
the
explanation
he
had
offered
was
a
little
crude
and
he
made
no
attempt
to
enlarge
on
it
with
a
complete
change
of
manner
with
his
old
smile
on
his
lips
and
his
eyes
as
dark
and
unsmiling
as
ever
he
said
pretty
girl
ella
is
she
she
is
more
than
pretty
she
is
beautiful
dunn
answered
with
an
emphasis
that
made
deede
dawson
look
at
him
sharply
think
so
he
said
and
gave
his
peculiar
laugh
that
had
so
little
mirth
in
it
well
you
right
she
is
he
be
a
lucky
man
that
gets
her
and
she
to
be
had
you
know
but
i
tell
you
one
thing
it
wo
be
john
i
thought
it
rather
looked
observed
dunn
as
if
miss
cayley
might
mean
deede
dawson
interrupted
with
a
quick
jerk
of
his
head
never
mind
what
she
means
it
be
what
i
mean
he
declared
i
am
boss
and
what
more
she
knows
it
i
believe
in
a
man
being
master
in
his
own
family
do
you
if
he
can
be
retorted
dunn
but
still
a
girl
naturally
naturally
nothing
deede
dawson
interrupted
again
i
tell
you
what
i
want
for
her
a
man
i
can
trust
trust
that
the
great
thing
some
one
i
can
he
nodded
at
dunn
as
he
said
this
and
then
walked
off
and
dunn
felt
very
puzzled
as
he
too
turned
away
was
he
offering
her
to
me
he
asked
himself
it
almost
sounded
like
it
if
so
it
must
mean
there
something
he
wants
from
me
pretty
bad
she
beautiful
enough
to
turn
any
man
head
but
did
she
know
about
poor
charlie
murder
help
in
it
perhaps
as
she
said
she
did
with
the
he
paused
and
all
his
body
was
shaken
by
strong
and
fierce
emotion
god
help
me
he
groaned
i
believe
i
would
marry
her
tomorrow
if
i
could
innocent
or
chapter
xiii
invisible
writing
it
was
the
next
day
that
there
arrived
by
the
morning
post
a
letter
for
dunn
deede
dawson
raised
his
eyebrows
slightly
when
he
saw
it
and
he
did
not
hand
it
on
until
he
had
made
himself
master
of
its
contents
though
that
did
not
prove
to
be
very
enlightening
or
interesting
the
note
in
fact
merely
expressed
gratification
at
the
news
that
dunn
had
secured
steady
work
a
somewhat
weak
hope
that
he
would
keep
it
and
a
still
fainter
hope
that
now
perhaps
he
would
be
able
to
return
the
ten
shillings
borrowed
apparently
from
the
writer
at
some
time
in
the
past
deede
dawson
in
spite
of
the
jejune
nature
of
the
communication
read
it
very
carefully
and
indeed
even
went
so
far
as
to
examine
the
letter
through
a
powerful
but
he
made
no
discovery
by
the
aid
of
that
instrument
and
he
neglected
for
no
man
thinks
of
everything
to
expose
the
letter
to
a
gentle
heat
which
was
what
dunn
did
when
presently
he
received
it
apparently
unopened
and
with
not
the
least
sign
to
show
that
it
had
been
tampered
with
in
any
way
whatever
gradually
however
as
dunn
held
it
to
the
fire
there
appeared
between
the
lines
fresh
writing
which
he
read
very
eagerly
and
which
ran
jane
dunsmore
born
married
against
family
wishes
john
clive
and
had
one
son
john
killed
early
this
year
in
a
accident
leaving
one
son
john
now
of
ramsdon
place
and
third
in
line
of
succession
to
the
wreste
abbey
when
he
had
read
the
message
thus
strangely
and
with
such
precaution
conveyed
to
him
dunn
burnt
the
letter
and
went
that
day
about
his
work
in
a
very
grave
and
thoughtful
mood
i
knew
it
could
be
a
mere
coincidence
he
mused
it
possible
i
must
manage
to
warn
him
somehow
but
ten
to
one
he
believe
a
word
and
i
do
know
that
i
blame
him
i
should
in
his
place
and
he
might
go
straight
to
deede
dawson
and
ruin
everything
i
do
know
that
it
would
be
wiser
and
safer
to
say
nothing
for
the
present
till
i
more
sure
of
my
ground
and
then
it
may
be
too
just
possibly
he
thought
the
job
deede
dawson
clearly
thinks
he
can
make
me
useful
in
may
have
something
to
do
with
clive
if
so
i
may
be
able
to
see
my
way
more
as
it
happened
clive
was
away
for
a
few
days
on
some
business
he
had
to
attend
to
so
that
for
the
present
dunn
thought
he
could
afford
to
wait
but
during
the
clive
returned
and
on
the
monday
he
came
again
to
bittermeads
it
was
never
very
agreeable
to
dunn
to
have
to
stand
aloof
while
clive
was
laughing
and
chatting
and
drinking
his
tea
with
ella
and
her
mother
and
of
those
feelings
of
annoyance
and
vexation
he
made
this
time
a
somewhat
ostentatious
show
that
his
manner
of
sulky
anger
and
resentment
did
not
go
unnoticed
by
deede
dawson
he
was
very
sure
but
nothing
was
said
at
the
time
next
morning
deede
dawson
called
him
while
he
was
busy
in
the
garage
and
insisted
on
his
trying
to
solve
another
chess
problem
i
have
managed
the
other
yet
dunn
protested
it
not
too
easy
to
hit
on
these
never
mind
try
this
one
deede
dawson
said
and
ella
going
out
for
a
morning
stroll
with
her
mother
saw
them
thus
poring
together
over
the
travelling
they
seem
busy
do
they
she
remarked
father
is
making
quite
a
friend
of
that
i
do
like
him
declared
dawson
quite
vigorously
for
her
sure
a
man
with
such
a
lot
of
hair
on
his
face
ca
be
really
nice
and
i
thought
he
was
inclined
to
be
rude
yes
agreed
ella
yes
he
was
i
think
clive
was
a
little
vexed
though
he
took
no
notice
i
suppose
he
could
very
i
do
like
the
man
at
all
dawson
repeated
all
that
hair
too
do
you
like
him
i
do
know
ella
answered
and
after
she
and
her
mother
had
returned
from
their
walk
she
took
occasion
to
find
dunn
in
the
garden
and
ask
him
some
trifling
question
or
another
you
are
interested
in
chess
she
remarked
when
he
had
answered
her
all
problems
are
interesting
till
one
finds
the
answer
to
them
he
replied
there
one
i
know
of
she
retorted
i
wish
you
would
solve
for
tell
me
what
it
is
he
said
quickly
will
you
she
shook
her
head
slightly
but
she
was
watching
him
very
intently
from
her
clear
candid
eyes
and
now
as
always
her
nearness
to
him
the
infinite
appeal
he
found
in
her
every
look
and
movement
the
very
fragrance
of
her
hair
bore
him
away
beyond
all
purpose
and
intention
tell
me
what
it
is
he
said
again
wo
you
miss
cayley
if
you
and
i
were
to
trust
each
other
it
not
difficult
to
see
there
something
troubling
most
people
have
some
trouble
or
another
she
answered
evasively
he
came
a
little
nearer
to
her
and
instead
of
the
gruff
harsh
tones
he
habitually
used
his
voice
was
singularly
pleasant
and
low
as
he
said
people
who
are
in
trouble
need
help
miss
cayley
will
you
let
me
help
you
you
ca
she
answered
shaking
her
head
no
one
how
can
you
tell
that
he
asked
eagerly
perhaps
i
know
more
already
than
you
i
daresay
you
do
she
said
slowly
i
have
thought
that
a
long
time
will
you
tell
me
one
thing
are
you
his
friend
or
not
there
was
no
need
for
dunn
to
ask
to
whom
the
pronoun
she
used
referred
i
am
so
much
not
his
friend
he
answered
as
quietly
and
deliberately
as
she
had
spoken
that
it
either
his
life
or
at
that
she
drew
back
in
a
startled
way
as
though
his
words
had
gone
beyond
her
expectations
how
do
i
know
i
can
trust
you
she
said
presently
half
to
herself
half
to
him
you
can
he
said
and
it
was
as
though
he
flung
the
whole
of
his
enigmatic
and
vivid
personality
into
those
two
words
you
can
he
said
again
i
must
think
she
muttered
pressing
her
hands
to
her
head
so
much
depends
how
can
i
trust
you
why
should
i
why
because
i
trust
you
first
he
answered
with
a
touch
of
exultation
in
his
manner
listen
to
me
and
i
tell
you
everything
and
that
means
i
put
my
life
in
your
hands
well
that
nothing
i
would
do
that
any
time
but
other
people
lives
will
be
in
your
power
too
yes
and
everything
i
here
for
everything
now
not
now
she
interrupted
sharply
he
may
be
watching
listening
he
generally
again
there
was
no
need
between
them
to
specify
to
whom
the
pronoun
referred
will
you
meet
me
tonight
near
the
border
about
nine
she
glided
away
as
she
spoke
without
waiting
for
him
to
answer
and
as
soon
as
he
was
free
from
the
magic
of
her
presence
reaction
came
and
he
was
torn
by
a
thousand
doubts
and
fears
and
worse
why
i
mad
mad
he
groaned
i
no
right
to
tell
what
i
said
i
would
no
right
at
and
again
there
returned
to
him
his
vivid
dreadful
memory
of
how
she
had
started
on
that
midnight
drive
with
her
car
so
awfully
laden
and
again
there
returned
to
him
his
old
appalling
doubt
did
she
not
know
and
though
he
would
willingly
have
left
his
life
in
her
hands
he
knew
he
had
no
right
to
put
that
of
others
there
and
yet
it
seemed
to
him
he
must
keep
the
appointment
and
the
promise
he
had
made
about
nine
that
evening
then
he
made
his
way
to
the
border
though
as
he
went
he
resolved
that
he
would
not
tell
her
what
he
had
said
he
would
because
he
trusted
his
own
strength
so
little
when
he
was
with
her
he
confirmed
this
resolution
by
an
oath
he
swore
to
himself
and
even
that
he
was
not
certain
would
be
a
sure
protection
against
the
witchery
she
wielded
so
it
was
with
a
mind
doubtful
and
troubled
more
than
it
had
ever
been
since
the
beginning
of
these
things
that
he
came
to
the
border
where
the
grew
and
saw
a
dark
shadow
already
close
by
them
but
when
he
came
a
little
nearer
he
saw
that
it
was
not
ella
who
was
there
but
deede
dawson
and
his
first
thought
was
that
she
had
betrayed
him
that
you
dunn
deede
dawson
hailed
him
in
his
usual
pleasant
friendly
manner
yes
dunn
answered
warily
keeping
himself
ready
for
any
eventuality
deede
dawson
took
a
cigar
from
his
pocket
and
lighted
it
and
offered
one
to
dunn
who
refused
it
abruptly
deede
dawson
laughed
at
that
in
his
peculiar
mirthless
way
am
i
being
the
third
that
proverbially
no
company
he
asked
were
you
expecting
to
find
some
one
else
here
i
thought
i
saw
a
white
frock
vanish
just
as
i
came
dunn
made
no
answer
and
deede
dawson
continued
after
a
pause
that
why
i
waited
you
are
being
just
a
little
bit
rapid
in
this
affair
are
you
i
do
know
why
you
said
something
did
you
muttered
dunn
beginning
to
think
that
after
all
deede
dawson
presence
here
was
due
to
accident
or
rather
to
his
unceasing
and
unfailing
watchfulness
and
not
to
any
treachery
of
ella
yes
i
did
did
i
he
agreed
pleasantly
but
you
are
a
working
gardener
taken
on
out
of
charity
to
give
you
a
chance
and
keep
you
out
of
gaol
and
you
are
looking
a
little
high
when
you
think
of
your
master
ward
and
daughter
are
you
there
was
a
time
when
i
should
have
thought
so
answered
dunn
we
talking
of
the
present
my
good
man
deede
dawson
said
impatiently
if
you
want
the
girl
you
must
win
her
it
can
be
done
but
it
wo
be
tell
me
how
said
dunn
oh
that
going
too
fast
and
too
far
answered
the
other
with
his
mirthless
laugh
now
there
john
clive
what
about
him
i
answer
for
him
replied
dunn
slowly
and
thickly
i
put
better
men
than
john
clive
out
of
my
way
before
that
the
way
to
talk
cried
deede
dawson
dunn
dare
you
play
a
big
game
for
big
stakes
try
me
said
dunn
if
i
showed
you
deede
dawson
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
if
i
showed
you
a
pretty
girl
for
a
wife
a
fortune
to
win
what
would
you
say
try
me
said
dunn
again
and
then
making
his
voice
as
low
and
hoarse
as
was
dunn
he
asked
is
it
clive
later
perhaps
answered
deede
dawson
there
some
one
else
first
are
you
ready
try
me
said
dunn
for
the
third
time
and
as
he
spoke
his
quick
ear
caught
the
faint
sound
of
a
retreating
footstep
and
he
told
himself
that
ella
must
have
lingered
near
and
had
perhaps
heard
all
they
said
try
me
he
said
once
more
speaking
more
loudly
and
clearly
this
time
chapter
xiv
at
night
dunn
went
to
his
room
that
night
with
the
feeling
that
a
crisis
was
approaching
and
he
wished
very
greatly
that
he
knew
how
much
ella
had
overheard
of
his
talk
with
her
stepfather
and
what
interpretation
she
had
put
upon
it
he
determined
that
in
the
morning
he
would
take
the
very
first
opportunity
he
could
find
of
speaking
to
her
but
in
the
morning
it
appeared
that
dawson
had
had
a
bad
night
and
was
very
unwell
and
ella
hardly
stirred
from
her
side
all
day
even
when
clive
called
in
the
afternoon
she
would
not
come
down
but
sent
instead
a
message
begging
to
be
excused
because
of
her
indisposition
and
dunn
from
a
secure
spot
in
the
garden
watched
the
young
man
retire
looking
very
disconsolate
this
day
too
dunn
saw
nothing
of
deede
dawson
for
that
gentleman
immediately
after
breakfast
disappeared
without
saying
anything
to
anybody
and
by
night
had
still
not
returned
dunn
therefore
was
left
entirely
to
himself
and
to
him
the
day
seemed
one
of
the
longest
he
had
ever
spent
that
ella
remained
so
persistently
with
her
mother
troubled
him
a
good
deal
for
he
did
not
think
such
close
seclusion
on
her
part
could
be
really
necessary
he
was
inclined
to
fear
that
ella
had
overheard
enough
of
what
had
passed
between
him
and
deede
dawson
to
rouse
her
mistrust
and
that
she
was
therefore
deliberately
keeping
out
of
his
way
then
too
he
was
troubled
in
another
fashion
by
deede
dawson
absence
for
he
was
afraid
it
might
mean
that
plans
were
being
prepared
or
possibly
action
being
taken
that
might
mature
disastrously
before
he
himself
was
ready
to
act
all
day
this
feeling
of
unrest
and
apprehension
continued
and
at
night
when
he
went
upstairs
to
bed
it
was
stronger
than
ever
he
felt
convinced
now
that
ella
was
deliberately
avoiding
him
but
then
if
she
distrusted
him
that
must
be
because
she
feared
he
was
on
her
stepfather
side
and
if
it
seemed
to
her
that
who
was
on
his
side
was
of
necessity
an
object
of
suspicion
to
herself
then
there
could
be
no
such
bond
of
dread
and
guilt
between
them
as
any
guilty
knowledge
on
her
part
of
wright
death
would
involve
the
substantial
proof
this
exercise
in
logic
appeared
to
afford
of
ella
innocence
brought
him
much
comfort
but
did
not
lighten
his
sense
of
apprehension
and
unrest
for
he
thought
that
in
this
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
his
doubts
of
ella
had
merely
been
turned
into
doubts
on
ella
part
of
himself
and
that
the
one
was
just
as
likely
as
the
other
to
end
disastrously
though
i
do
know
what
i
can
do
he
muttered
as
he
stood
in
his
attic
if
i
gain
deede
dawson
confidence
i
lose
ella
and
if
i
win
ella
deede
dawson
will
at
once
suspect
he
went
over
to
the
window
and
looked
out
supporting
himself
on
his
elbows
and
gazing
moodily
into
the
darkness
as
he
stood
there
a
faint
sound
came
softly
to
his
ear
through
the
stillness
of
the
quiet
night
in
which
nothing
stirred
he
listened
and
heard
it
again
beyond
doubt
some
one
was
stirring
in
the
garden
below
moving
about
there
very
cautiously
and
carefully
and
at
once
dunn
glided
from
the
room
and
down
the
stairs
with
all
that
extraordinary
lightness
of
tread
and
agility
of
movement
of
which
his
heavy
body
and
build
gave
so
small
promise
he
had
not
been
living
so
many
days
in
the
house
without
having
taken
certain
precautions
of
which
one
had
been
to
secure
for
himself
a
swift
and
silent
egress
whenever
necessity
might
arise
keys
to
both
the
front
and
back
doors
were
in
his
possession
and
the
passage
window
on
the
ground
floor
he
could
at
need
lift
bodily
from
its
frame
leaving
ample
room
for
passage
either
in
or
out
this
was
the
method
of
departure
he
chose
now
since
he
did
not
know
but
that
the
doors
might
be
watched
lifting
the
window
down
he
swung
himself
outside
replacing
behind
him
the
window
so
that
it
appeared
to
be
as
firmly
in
position
as
ever
but
could
be
removed
again
almost
instantly
should
need
arise
once
outside
he
listened
again
and
though
at
first
everything
was
quiet
presently
he
heard
again
a
cautious
step
going
to
and
fro
at
a
little
distance
crouching
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
he
listened
intently
and
soon
was
able
to
assure
himself
that
there
was
but
one
footstep
and
that
he
would
have
only
one
individual
to
deal
with
it
wo
be
deede
dawson
he
thought
to
himself
but
it
may
very
likely
be
some
one
waiting
for
him
to
return
i
must
find
out
who
and
slipping
through
the
darkness
of
the
night
with
whose
shadows
he
seemed
to
melt
and
mingle
as
though
he
were
but
another
one
of
them
he
moved
quickly
in
the
direction
of
these
cautious
footsteps
he
had
listened
to
they
had
ceased
now
and
the
silence
was
profound
for
those
faint
multitudinous
noises
of
the
night
that
murmur
without
ceasing
in
the
woods
and
fields
are
less
noticeable
near
the
habitations
of
men
a
little
puzzled
dunn
paused
to
listen
again
and
once
more
crept
forward
a
careful
yard
or
two
and
then
lay
still
feeling
it
would
not
be
safe
to
venture
further
till
he
was
more
sure
of
his
direction
and
till
some
fresh
sound
to
guide
him
reached
his
ears
he
had
not
long
to
wait
for
very
soon
from
quite
close
by
he
heard
something
that
surprised
and
perplexed
him
equally
a
deep
sigh
again
he
heard
it
and
in
utter
wonder
asked
himself
who
this
could
be
who
came
into
another
person
garden
late
at
night
to
stand
and
sigh
and
what
such
a
proceeding
could
mean
once
more
he
heard
the
sigh
deeper
even
than
before
and
then
after
it
a
low
murmur
in
which
at
first
he
could
distinguish
nothing
but
then
caught
the
name
of
ella
being
whispered
over
and
over
again
he
bent
forward
more
and
more
puzzled
trying
in
vain
to
make
out
something
in
the
darkness
and
then
from
under
a
tree
whose
shadow
had
hitherto
been
a
complete
concealment
there
moved
forward
a
form
so
tall
and
bulky
there
could
be
little
doubt
whom
it
belonged
to
john
clive
what
on
earth
dunn
muttered
his
bewilderment
increasing
and
the
next
moment
he
understood
and
had
some
difficulty
in
preventing
himself
from
bursting
out
laughing
as
there
reached
him
the
unmistakable
sound
of
a
kiss
lightly
blown
through
the
air
clive
was
sending
a
kiss
through
the
night
towards
ella
room
and
his
nocturnal
visit
was
nothing
more
than
the
whim
of
a
youth
with
dunn
his
first
amusement
gave
way
almost
at
once
to
an
extreme
annoyance
for
in
the
first
place
these
proceedings
seemed
to
him
exceedingly
impertinent
for
what
possible
right
did
clive
imagine
he
had
to
come
playing
the
fool
like
this
sighing
in
the
dark
and
blowing
kisses
like
a
baby
to
its
mammy
and
secondly
unless
he
were
greatly
mistaken
john
clive
might
just
as
sensibly
and
safely
have
dropped
overboard
from
a
ship
in
for
a
swim
as
come
to
indulge
his
sentimentalities
in
the
bittermeads
garden
at
night
you
silly
ass
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
very
low
but
very
distinct
and
very
full
of
an
extreme
disgust
and
anger
clive
fairly
leaped
in
the
air
with
his
surprise
and
turned
and
made
a
sudden
dash
at
the
spot
whence
dunn
voice
had
come
but
where
dunn
no
longer
was
what
the
blazes
he
began
spluttering
in
ineffectual
rage
you
you
you
silly
ass
dunn
repeated
no
less
emphatically
than
before
clive
made
another
rush
that
a
somewhat
prickly
bush
very
effectually
stopped
you
who
are
you
where
what
how
dare
you
he
gasped
as
he
picked
himself
up
and
tried
to
disentangle
himself
from
the
prickles
do
make
such
a
row
said
dunn
from
a
new
direction
do
you
want
to
raise
the
whole
neighbourhood
have
you
played
the
fool
enough
if
you
want
to
commit
suicide
why
ca
you
cut
your
throat
quietly
and
decently
at
home
instead
of
coming
alone
to
the
garden
at
bittermeads
at
night
there
was
a
note
of
sombre
and
intense
conviction
in
his
voice
that
penetrated
even
the
excited
mind
of
the
raging
clive
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
and
then
who
are
you
never
mind
who
i
am
answered
dunn
and
i
mean
just
what
i
say
you
might
as
well
commit
suicide
out
of
hand
as
come
fooling
about
here
alone
at
you
crazy
you
talking
rubbish
clive
exclaimed
i
neither
crazy
nor
talking
rubbish
answered
dunn
but
if
you
persist
in
making
such
a
row
i
shall
take
myself
off
and
leave
you
to
see
the
thing
through
by
yourself
and
get
yourself
knocked
on
the
head
any
way
you
like
oh
i
beginning
to
understand
said
clive
i
suppose
you
one
of
my
poaching
friends
are
you
look
here
if
you
know
who
it
was
who
attacked
me
the
other
night
you
can
earn
fifty
pounds
any
time
you
your
poaching
friends
as
you
call
them
answered
dunn
are
most
likely
only
anxious
to
keep
out
of
your
way
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
well
come
nearer
and
let
me
see
you
clive
said
you
need
be
afraid
you
ca
expect
me
to
take
any
notice
of
some
one
i
ca
see
talking
rubbish
in
the
i
do
much
care
whether
you
take
any
notice
or
not
answered
dunn
you
can
go
your
own
silly
way
if
you
like
it
nothing
to
me
warned
you
and
if
you
care
to
listen
i
make
my
warning
a
little
clearer
and
one
thing
i
will
tell
you
one
man
already
has
left
this
house
hidden
in
a
with
a
bullet
through
his
brain
and
i
will
ask
you
a
question
did
your
father
die
he
was
killed
in
a
accident
answered
clive
hesitatingly
as
though
not
certain
whether
to
continue
this
strange
and
puzzling
conversation
or
break
it
off
there
are
many
accidents
said
dunn
and
that
may
have
been
one
for
all
i
know
or
it
may
not
well
i
warned
you
i
had
to
do
that
you
probably
go
on
acting
like
a
fool
and
believing
that
nowadays
murders
do
happen
but
if
you
wise
you
go
home
to
bed
and
run
no
more
silly
of
course
i
not
going
to
pay
the
least
attention
began
clive
when
dunn
interrupted
him
sharply
hush
hush
he
said
sharply
crouch
down
do
make
a
sound
stir
or
move
hush
for
dunn
sharp
ear
had
caught
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
that
were
drawing
quickly
nearer
and
almost
instantly
he
guessed
who
it
would
be
for
there
were
few
pedestrians
who
came
along
that
lonely
road
so
late
at
night
there
were
two
of
them
apparently
and
at
the
gate
of
bittermeads
they
halted
well
good
night
said
then
a
voice
both
dunn
and
clive
knew
at
once
for
deede
dawson
that
was
a
pretty
check
by
the
knight
i
showed
you
was
it
a
thin
high
somewhat
peculiar
voice
cursed
deede
dawson
chess
and
the
pretty
mate
by
the
knight
very
comprehensively
it
young
clive
that
worries
me
said
the
voice
when
it
had
finished
these
expressions
of
disapproval
no
need
answered
deede
dawson
voice
with
that
strange
mirthless
laugh
of
his
no
need
at
all
before
the
week
out
he
trouble
no
one
any
when
he
heard
this
clive
would
have
betrayed
himself
by
some
startled
movement
or
angry
exclamation
had
not
dunn
heavy
hand
upon
his
shoulder
held
him
down
with
a
grave
and
steady
pressure
there
was
no
disregarding
deede
dawson
and
his
unknown
companion
went
on
towards
the
house
and
admitted
themselves
and
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
clive
swung
round
sharply
in
the
darkness
towards
dunn
what
it
mean
he
muttered
in
the
bewildered
and
voice
of
a
child
at
once
frightened
and
puzzled
what
for
why
should
any
one
it
a
long
story
began
dunn
and
paused
he
saw
that
the
unexpected
confirmation
of
his
warning
clive
had
thus
received
from
deede
dawson
own
lips
had
rendered
his
task
of
convincing
clive
immensely
more
easy
what
he
had
wished
to
say
had
now
at
least
a
certainty
of
being
listened
to
a
probability
of
being
believed
and
there
was
at
any
rate
he
supposed
no
longer
the
danger
he
had
before
dreaded
of
clive
going
straight
with
the
whole
story
to
deede
dawson
in
arrogant
disbelief
of
a
word
of
it
but
he
still
distrusted
clive
discretion
and
feared
some
rash
and
hasty
action
that
might
ruin
all
his
plans
and
allow
deede
dawson
time
to
escape
besides
he
felt
that
the
immediate
task
before
him
was
to
find
out
who
deede
dawson
new
companion
was
and
if
possible
overhear
anything
they
might
have
to
say
to
each
other
that
and
the
discovery
of
the
identity
might
prove
to
be
of
the
utmost
importance
i
ca
explain
now
he
said
hurriedly
i
see
you
tomorrow
sometime
do
do
anything
till
you
hear
from
me
your
life
may
depend
on
it
and
other
people
lives
that
matter
tell
me
who
you
are
first
clive
said
quickly
incautiously
raising
his
voice
i
can
manage
to
take
care
of
myself
all
right
i
think
but
i
want
to
know
who
you
muttered
dunn
not
so
there
was
a
fellow
made
an
attack
on
me
one
night
a
little
while
ago
clive
went
on
unheedingly
you
remind
me
of
him
somehow
i
do
think
i
trust
you
my
man
i
think
you
had
better
come
along
to
the
police
with
but
dunn
sharp
ears
had
caught
the
sound
of
the
house
door
opening
cautiously
and
he
guessed
that
deede
dawson
had
taken
the
alarm
and
was
creeping
out
to
see
who
invaded
so
late
at
night
the
privacy
of
his
garden
clear
out
quick
quiet
if
you
want
to
go
on
living
i
stop
them
from
following
if
i
can
if
you
make
the
least
noise
you
done
most
likely
the
man
they
had
seen
in
his
company
would
be
with
him
and
both
of
them
would
be
armed
neither
clive
nor
dunn
had
a
weapon
and
dunn
saw
the
danger
of
the
position
and
took
the
only
course
available
go
he
whispered
fiercely
into
clive
ear
chapter
xv
the
sound
of
a
shot
he
melted
away
into
the
darkness
as
he
spoke
and
through
the
night
he
slipped
one
shadow
more
amongst
many
from
tree
to
bush
from
bush
to
tree
across
a
patch
of
open
grass
he
crawled
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
once
lay
flat
on
his
face
when
against
the
skyline
he
saw
a
figure
he
was
sure
was
deede
dawson
creep
by
a
yard
or
two
on
his
right
hand
on
his
left
another
shadow
showed
distinguishable
in
the
night
only
because
it
moved
in
a
moment
both
shadows
were
gone
secret
and
deadly
in
the
dark
and
dunn
was
very
sure
that
clive
life
and
his
own
both
hung
upon
a
slender
chance
for
if
either
of
them
was
discovered
the
leaping
bullet
would
do
the
rest
it
would
be
safe
and
easy
suspected
burglars
in
a
garden
at
midnight
nothing
could
be
said
he
lay
very
still
with
his
face
to
the
dewy
sod
and
all
the
night
seemed
full
to
him
of
searching
footsteps
and
of
a
swift
and
murderous
going
to
and
fro
he
heard
distinctly
from
the
road
a
sudden
muffled
sound
as
clive
in
the
darkness
blunderingly
missed
his
footing
and
fell
upon
one
knee
that
finished
him
dunn
thought
grimly
his
ears
straining
for
the
sharp
pistol
report
that
would
tell
clive
tale
was
done
and
then
he
was
aware
of
a
cat
a
favourite
of
ella
and
often
petted
by
himself
that
was
crouching
near
by
under
a
tree
most
likely
much
puzzled
and
alarmed
by
this
sudden
irruption
of
hurrying
men
into
its
domain
instantly
dunn
saw
his
chance
and
seizing
the
animal
lifted
it
and
threw
it
in
the
direction
where
he
guessed
deede
dawson
to
be
his
guess
was
good
and
fortune
served
him
well
for
the
tabby
flying
caterwauling
through
the
air
alighted
almost
exactly
in
front
of
deede
dawson
on
top
of
a
small
bush
for
a
moment
it
hung
there
quite
unhurt
but
very
frightened
and
emitted
a
yell
then
fled
in
the
quietness
the
tumult
of
its
scrambling
flight
sounded
astonishingly
loud
so
that
it
sounded
as
through
a
miniature
avalanche
had
been
let
loose
in
the
garden
only
cats
deede
dawson
exclaimed
disgustedly
and
from
behind
nearer
the
house
dunn
called
who
there
what
is
it
what
the
matter
is
it
dawson
is
anything
wrong
i
think
there
is
said
deede
dawson
softly
i
think
perhaps
there
is
what
are
you
doing
out
here
at
this
time
of
night
charley
wright
i
heard
a
noise
and
came
down
to
see
what
it
was
answered
dunn
there
was
a
light
in
the
but
i
did
see
any
one
and
the
front
door
was
open
so
i
came
out
here
is
anything
wrong
that
what
i
want
to
know
said
deede
dawson
come
back
to
the
house
with
me
if
any
one
is
about
he
can
just
take
himself
he
spoke
the
last
sentence
loudly
and
dunn
took
it
as
a
veiled
instruction
to
his
companion
to
depart
he
realized
that
if
he
had
saved
clive
he
had
done
so
at
the
cost
of
missing
the
best
opportunity
that
had
yet
come
his
way
of
obtaining
very
important
and
perhaps
decisive
information
to
have
discovered
the
identity
of
this
stranger
who
had
come
visiting
deede
dawson
might
have
meant
much
and
he
told
himself
angrily
that
clive
safety
had
certainly
not
been
worth
purchasing
at
the
cost
of
such
a
lost
chance
though
he
supposed
that
was
a
point
on
which
clive
himself
might
possibly
entertain
a
different
opinion
but
now
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
quietly
back
to
the
house
for
clearly
deede
dawson
suspicions
were
aroused
and
he
had
his
revolver
ready
in
his
hand
i
suppose
it
was
only
cats
all
the
time
he
observed
with
apparent
unconcern
but
at
first
i
made
sure
there
were
no
burglars
in
the
and
i
suppose
suggested
deede
dawson
you
think
one
burglar
enough
in
a
i
do
mean
to
have
any
one
else
mucking
around
growled
dunn
in
answer
very
admirable
sentiments
said
deede
dawson
and
asked
several
more
questions
that
showed
he
still
entertained
some
suspicion
of
dunn
and
was
not
altogether
satisfied
that
his
appearance
in
the
garden
was
quite
innocent
or
that
the
noise
heard
there
was
due
solely
to
cats
dunn
answered
as
best
he
could
and
deede
dawson
listened
and
smiled
and
smiled
again
and
watched
him
from
eyes
that
did
not
smile
at
all
oh
well
deede
dawson
said
at
last
with
a
yawn
anyhow
it
all
right
now
you
had
better
get
along
back
to
bed
and
i
lock
he
accompanied
dunn
into
the
hall
and
watched
him
ascend
the
stairs
and
as
dunn
went
slowly
up
them
he
felt
by
no
means
sure
that
soon
a
bullet
would
not
come
questing
after
him
searching
for
heart
or
brain
for
he
was
sure
that
deede
dawson
still
suspected
him
and
he
knew
deede
dawson
to
be
very
sudden
and
swift
in
action
but
nothing
happened
he
reached
the
broad
first
landing
in
safety
and
he
was
about
to
go
on
up
to
his
attic
when
he
beard
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
open
and
saw
ella
appear
in
her
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
it
all
right
he
answered
there
was
a
noise
in
the
garden
and
i
came
down
to
see
what
it
was
but
it
only
oh
is
that
all
she
said
distrustfully
yes
he
answered
in
a
lower
voice
still
he
said
will
you
tell
me
something
do
you
know
any
one
who
talks
in
a
very
peculiar
shrill
high
voice
she
did
not
answer
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
went
back
into
her
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
he
went
on
up
to
his
attic
with
the
feeling
that
she
could
have
answered
if
she
had
wished
to
and
lay
down
in
a
troubled
and
dispirited
mood
for
he
was
sure
now
that
ella
mistrusted
him
and
would
give
him
no
assistance
and
that
weighed
upon
him
greatly
as
did
also
his
conviction
that
what
it
behoved
him
above
all
else
to
know
the
identity
of
the
man
who
in
this
affair
stood
behind
deede
dawson
and
made
use
of
his
fierce
and
fatal
energies
he
had
had
it
in
his
power
to
discover
and
had
failed
to
make
use
of
the
opportunity
i
would
rather
know
that
he
said
to
himself
than
save
a
dozen
clives
ten
times
though
again
it
occurred
to
him
that
on
this
point
clive
might
hold
another
opinion
if
he
had
made
such
a
blundering
row
i
might
have
got
to
know
who
deede
dawson
visitor
was
i
must
try
to
get
a
word
with
clive
tomorrow
by
hook
or
crook
though
i
daresay
deede
dawson
will
be
very
much
on
the
however
next
morning
deede
dawson
not
only
made
no
reference
to
the
events
of
the
night
but
had
out
the
car
and
went
off
immediately
after
breakfast
without
saying
when
he
would
be
back
as
soon
after
his
departure
as
possible
dunn
also
set
out
and
took
his
way
through
the
woods
towards
ramsdon
place
on
the
for
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
clive
unobserved
he
thought
it
most
likely
that
clive
would
be
drawn
towards
the
vicinity
of
bittermeads
by
the
double
fascination
of
curiosity
and
fear
and
he
supposed
that
if
he
waited
and
watched
in
the
woods
he
would
be
sure
presently
to
see
him
but
though
he
remained
for
long
hidden
at
a
spot
whence
he
could
command
the
road
to
bittermeads
from
ramsdon
place
he
saw
nothing
at
all
of
clive
and
the
sunny
lazy
morning
was
well
advanced
when
he
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
a
gun
shot
some
distance
away
a
keeper
shooting
rabbits
i
suppose
he
thought
looking
round
just
in
time
to
see
ella
running
through
the
wood
from
the
direction
whence
the
sound
of
the
shot
had
seemed
to
come
and
then
vanish
again
with
a
quick
look
behind
her
into
the
heart
of
a
spinney
chapter
xvi
in
the
wood
there
had
been
an
air
of
haste
almost
of
furtiveness
about
this
swift
appearance
and
more
swift
vanishing
of
ella
that
made
dunn
ask
himself
uneasily
what
errand
she
could
have
been
on
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
half
expecting
to
see
her
return
again
or
that
there
would
be
some
other
development
but
he
heard
and
saw
nothing
he
caught
no
further
glimpse
of
ella
whom
the
green
depths
of
the
spinney
hid
well
and
he
heard
no
more
shots
after
a
little
he
left
the
spot
where
he
had
been
waiting
and
went
across
to
where
he
had
seen
her
the
exact
spot
where
she
had
entered
the
spinney
was
marked
for
she
had
broken
the
branch
of
a
young
tree
in
brushing
quickly
by
it
and
a
bramble
she
had
trodden
on
had
not
yet
lifted
itself
from
the
earth
to
which
she
had
pressed
it
by
other
signs
like
these
plain
enough
and
easy
to
read
for
she
had
hurried
on
in
great
haste
and
without
care
almost
indeed
as
one
who
fled
from
some
great
danger
or
from
some
dreadful
sight
and
who
had
no
thought
to
spare
save
for
flight
alone
he
followed
the
way
she
had
gone
till
it
took
him
to
a
beaten
public
path
that
almost
at
once
led
over
a
stile
to
the
high
road
which
passed
in
front
of
bittermeads
along
this
beaten
path
trodden
by
many
ella
light
foot
had
left
no
perceptible
mark
and
dunn
made
no
attempt
to
track
her
further
since
it
seemed
certain
that
she
had
been
simply
hurrying
back
home
she
was
badly
frightened
over
something
or
another
he
said
to
himself
she
never
stopped
once
she
went
as
straight
and
quick
as
she
could
i
wonder
what
upset
her
like
that
he
went
back
the
way
he
had
come
and
at
the
spot
where
he
had
seen
her
enter
the
spinney
he
set
to
work
to
pick
up
her
trail
in
the
direction
whence
she
had
appeared
for
he
thought
that
if
he
followed
it
he
might
find
out
what
had
been
the
cause
of
her
evident
alarm
the
ground
was
much
more
open
here
and
the
trail
correspondingly
more
difficult
to
follow
for
often
there
was
little
but
a
trodden
blade
of
grass
to
show
where
she
had
passed
and
sometimes
where
the
ground
was
bare
and
hard
there
was
no
visible
sign
left
at
all
once
or
twice
at
such
places
he
was
totally
at
fault
but
by
casting
round
in
a
wide
circle
like
a
dog
scenting
his
prey
he
was
able
to
pick
up
her
tracks
again
they
seemed
to
lead
right
into
the
depths
of
the
wood
through
lonely
spots
that
only
the
keepers
knew
and
where
others
seldom
came
but
that
he
was
on
the
right
trail
he
presently
had
proof
for
on
the
bank
of
a
lovely
and
hidden
dell
he
picked
up
a
tiny
embroidered
handkerchief
with
the
initials
e
worked
in
one
corner
it
had
evidently
been
lying
there
only
a
very
short
time
for
it
was
perfectly
clean
and
fresh
and
he
picked
it
up
and
held
it
for
a
moment
in
his
hands
smiling
to
himself
with
pleasure
at
its
daintiness
and
smallness
and
yet
still
uneasily
wondering
why
she
had
come
here
and
why
she
had
fled
away
again
so
quickly
the
morning
was
very
fine
and
calm
though
in
the
west
heavy
clouds
were
gathering
and
seemed
to
promise
rain
soon
but
overhead
the
sun
shone
brightly
the
air
was
calm
and
warm
and
the
little
dell
on
whose
verge
he
stood
a
very
pretty
and
pleasant
place
a
small
stream
wandered
through
it
the
grass
that
carpeted
it
was
green
and
soft
near
by
a
great
oak
stood
alone
and
spread
its
majestic
branches
far
out
on
every
side
to
give
cool
shelter
from
the
summer
heat
the
thought
occurred
to
dunn
that
this
was
just
such
a
pretty
and
secluded
spot
as
two
lovers
might
choose
to
exchange
their
vows
in
and
the
thought
stung
him
intolerably
as
he
wondered
whether
it
was
for
such
a
reason
that
ella
had
come
here
but
if
so
why
had
she
fled
away
again
in
such
strange
haste
he
walked
on
slowly
for
a
yard
or
two
not
now
attempting
to
follow
ella
trail
for
he
had
the
impression
that
this
was
her
destination
and
that
she
had
gone
no
further
than
here
all
at
once
he
caught
sight
of
the
form
of
a
man
lying
hidden
in
the
long
grass
that
nearly
covered
him
from
view
just
where
the
branches
of
the
great
oak
ceased
to
give
their
shade
at
first
dunn
thought
he
was
sleeping
and
he
was
just
about
to
call
out
to
him
when
something
in
the
rigidity
of
the
man
position
and
his
utter
stillness
struck
him
unpleasantly
he
went
quickly
to
the
man
side
and
the
face
of
dead
john
clive
supine
and
still
stared
up
at
him
from
unseeing
eyes
he
had
been
killed
by
a
charge
of
small
shot
fired
at
such
close
quarters
that
his
breast
was
shot
nearly
in
two
and
his
clothing
and
flesh
charred
by
the
burning
powder
but
dunn
standing
staring
down
at
the
dead
man
saw
not
him
but
ella
ella
fleeing
away
silently
and
furtively
through
the
trees
as
from
some
sight
or
scene
of
guilt
and
terror
he
stooped
closer
over
the
dead
man
death
had
been
instantaneous
of
course
there
could
be
no
doubt
from
one
hand
a
piece
of
folded
paper
had
fallen
dunn
picked
it
up
and
saw
that
there
was
writing
on
it
and
he
read
it
over
slowly
dear
clive
can
you
meet
me
as
before
by
the
oak
tomorrow
at
eleven
there
is
something
i
very
much
want
to
say
to
yours
sincerely
ella
was
that
then
the
lure
which
had
brought
john
clive
to
meet
his
death
was
this
the
bait
that
had
made
him
disregard
the
warnings
he
had
received
and
come
alone
to
so
quiet
and
solitary
a
spot
dunn
had
a
moment
of
quick
envy
of
him
he
lay
so
quiet
and
still
in
the
warm
sunshine
with
nothing
to
trouble
or
distress
him
any
more
for
ever
then
stumblingly
and
heavily
dunn
turned
an
went
away
and
his
eyes
were
very
hard
his
bearded
face
set
like
iron
like
a
man
in
a
dream
or
one
obsessed
by
some
purpose
before
which
all
other
things
faded
into
nothingness
he
went
his
way
the
way
ella
had
taken
in
her
flight
through
the
wood
through
the
spinney
to
the
public
and
then
out
on
the
road
that
led
to
bittermeads
when
he
entered
the
garden
there
he
saw
ella
sitting
quietly
on
a
close
to
her
mother
quietly
busy
with
some
fancy
work
he
could
not
believe
it
he
stood
watching
in
bewilderment
appalled
and
wondering
watching
her
white
hands
flashing
busily
to
and
fro
hearing
the
soft
murmur
of
her
voice
as
now
and
then
she
addressed
some
remark
to
her
mother
who
nodded
drowsily
in
the
sunshine
over
a
book
open
on
her
knees
ella
was
dressed
all
in
white
she
had
flung
aside
her
hat
and
the
quiet
breeze
played
in
her
fair
hair
and
stirred
gently
a
stray
curl
that
had
escaped
across
her
broad
low
brow
the
picture
was
one
of
gentleness
and
peace
and
an
innocence
that
thought
no
wrong
and
yet
with
his
own
eyes
he
had
seen
her
not
an
hour
ago
fleeing
with
hurried
steps
and
fearful
looks
from
the
spot
where
lay
a
murdered
man
somewhat
unsteadily
for
he
felt
so
little
master
of
himself
it
was
as
though
he
had
no
longer
even
control
of
his
own
limbs
dunn
stumbled
forward
and
ella
looked
up
and
saw
him
and
saw
also
that
he
was
looking
at
her
very
strangely
she
rose
and
came
towards
him
her
needlework
still
in
her
hands
what
is
the
matter
she
said
in
a
voice
of
some
concern
are
you
ill
no
he
answered
no
i
been
looking
for
have
you
she
said
a
little
surprised
apparently
but
in
no
way
flustered
or
disturbed
did
you
find
him
dunn
did
not
answer
for
indeed
he
could
not
and
she
said
again
did
you
find
him
still
he
made
no
answer
for
it
seemed
to
him
those
four
words
were
the
most
awful
that
any
one
had
ever
uttered
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
what
is
the
matter
she
said
again
is
anything
the
matter
oh
no
no
he
said
and
he
gave
himself
a
little
shake
like
a
man
wakening
from
deep
sleep
and
trying
to
remember
where
he
was
well
then
she
said
i
found
clive
he
said
hardly
and
abruptly
and
he
repeated
again
yes
i
found
they
remained
standing
close
together
and
facing
each
other
and
he
saw
her
as
through
a
veil
of
red
and
it
was
as
though
a
red
mist
enveloped
her
and
where
her
shadow
lay
the
earth
was
red
he
thought
and
where
she
put
her
foot
it
seemed
to
him
red
tracks
remained
and
never
before
had
he
understood
how
utterly
he
loved
her
and
must
love
her
now
and
for
evermore
but
he
uttered
no
sound
and
made
no
movement
only
stood
very
still
thinking
to
himself
how
dreadful
it
was
that
he
loved
her
so
greatly
she
was
not
paying
him
any
attention
now
a
rose
bush
was
near
by
and
she
picked
one
of
the
flowers
and
arranged
it
carefully
at
her
waist
she
said
still
looking
at
him
do
you
know
i
wish
you
would
shave
yourself
why
he
mumbled
i
should
like
to
see
you
she
answered
i
think
i
have
a
curiosity
to
see
i
should
think
you
could
do
that
well
enough
he
said
in
the
same
low
mumbled
tones
no
she
answered
i
can
only
see
some
very
untidy
hair
and
a
pair
of
eyes
not
very
nice
eyes
rather
frightening
eyes
i
should
like
to
see
the
rest
of
your
face
some
day
so
as
to
know
what
it
perhaps
you
shall
some
day
he
said
is
that
a
threat
she
asked
it
sounded
like
perhaps
he
answered
she
laughed
lightly
and
turned
away
you
make
me
very
curious
she
said
but
then
you
always
done
she
went
back
to
her
seat
by
her
mother
and
he
walked
on
moodily
to
the
house
dawson
said
to
ella
how
can
you
talk
to
that
man
my
dear
i
think
he
looks
perfectly
dreadful
hardly
like
a
human
i
was
just
telling
him
he
ought
to
shave
himself
said
ella
i
told
him
i
should
like
to
know
what
he
was
really
i
shall
ask
father
said
dawson
sternly
to
make
it
a
condition
of
his
employment
chapter
xvii
a
declaration
dunn
knew
very
well
that
he
ought
to
give
immediate
information
to
the
authorities
of
what
had
happened
but
he
did
not
he
told
himself
that
nothing
could
help
poor
john
clive
and
that
any
precipitate
action
on
his
part
might
still
fatally
compromise
his
plans
which
were
now
so
near
completion
but
his
real
reason
was
that
he
knew
that
if
he
came
forward
he
would
be
very
closely
questioned
and
sooner
or
later
forced
to
tell
the
things
he
knew
so
terribly
involving
ella
and
he
knew
that
to
surrender
her
to
the
police
and
proclaim
her
to
the
world
as
guilty
of
such
things
were
tasks
beyond
his
strength
though
to
himself
with
a
touch
of
wildness
in
his
thoughts
he
said
that
no
proved
and
certain
guilt
should
go
unpunished
even
though
his
own
hand
it
was
a
train
of
ideas
he
did
not
pursue
charley
wright
first
and
now
john
clive
he
said
to
himself
but
the
end
is
not
again
he
would
not
let
his
thoughts
go
on
but
checked
them
abruptly
in
this
dark
and
troubled
mood
he
went
out
to
busy
himself
with
the
garden
and
all
the
time
he
worked
he
watched
with
a
sort
of
vertigo
of
horror
where
ella
sat
in
the
sunshine
by
her
mother
side
her
white
hands
moving
nimbly
to
and
fro
upon
her
needlework
it
was
not
long
however
before
the
tragedy
of
the
wood
was
discovered
for
clive
had
been
seen
to
go
in
that
direction
and
when
he
did
not
return
a
search
was
made
that
was
soon
successful
the
news
was
brought
to
bittermeads
towards
evening
by
a
boy
who
came
up
from
the
village
to
bring
something
that
had
been
ordered
from
there
have
you
heard
he
said
to
dunn
excitedly
mr
clive
been
shot
dead
by
oh
by
poachers
repeated
dunn
yes
poachers
the
boy
answered
and
went
on
excitedly
to
tell
his
tale
with
many
and
generally
very
inaccurate
details
but
that
the
crime
had
been
discovered
and
instantly
set
down
to
poachers
was
at
least
certain
and
dunn
realized
at
once
that
the
adoption
of
this
simple
and
apparently
plausible
theory
would
put
an
end
to
all
really
careful
investigation
of
the
circumstances
and
make
the
discovery
of
the
truth
highly
improbable
for
the
idea
that
the
murder
was
the
work
of
poachers
would
when
once
adopted
fill
the
minds
of
the
police
and
of
every
one
else
and
no
suspicion
would
be
directed
elsewhere
by
the
tremendous
relief
he
felt
dunn
understood
how
heavy
had
been
the
burden
of
fear
and
apprehension
that
till
now
had
oppressed
him
if
he
had
not
found
that
handkerchief
if
he
had
not
secured
that
letter
why
by
now
the
police
would
be
at
bittermeads
all
the
same
he
thought
no
one
who
is
guilty
shall
escape
through
but
what
this
phrase
meant
and
what
he
intended
to
do
he
would
not
permit
himself
to
think
out
clearly
or
try
to
understand
the
boy
having
told
his
story
hurried
off
to
spread
the
news
elsewhere
to
more
appreciative
ears
for
he
thought
disgustedly
it
might
have
been
just
nothing
at
all
for
all
the
interest
the
gardener
at
bittermeads
had
shown
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
dunn
went
across
to
the
house
and
going
up
to
the
window
of
the
where
ella
and
her
mother
were
having
tea
he
tapped
on
the
pane
ella
looked
up
and
saw
him
and
came
at
once
to
open
the
window
while
from
behind
dawson
frowned
in
severe
disapproval
of
what
she
considered
a
great
liberty
mr
clive
has
been
shot
dunn
said
abruptly
they
say
poachers
did
it
he
was
killed
ella
did
not
seem
at
first
to
understand
she
looked
puzzled
and
bewildered
and
did
not
seem
to
grasp
the
full
import
of
his
words
what
what
do
you
say
she
asked
mr
clive
who
killed
dunn
thought
to
himself
that
her
acting
was
the
most
wonderful
thing
he
had
ever
seen
it
was
extraordinary
that
she
should
be
able
to
make
that
grey
pallor
come
over
her
cheeks
as
though
the
meaning
of
what
he
said
were
only
now
entering
her
mind
wonderful
that
she
should
be
able
so
well
to
give
the
idea
of
a
great
horror
and
a
great
doubt
coming
slowly
into
her
startled
eyes
mr
clive
she
said
again
yes
he
been
killed
dunn
said
by
poachers
what
is
that
what
is
that
man
saying
shrilled
dawson
from
behind
mr
clive
john
why
he
was
here
dunn
turned
his
back
and
walked
away
he
heard
ella
call
after
him
but
he
would
not
look
back
because
he
feared
what
he
might
do
if
he
obeyed
her
call
with
an
odd
buzzing
in
his
ears
with
the
blood
throbbing
through
his
brain
as
though
something
must
soon
break
there
he
walked
blindly
on
and
as
he
came
to
the
gate
of
bittermeads
he
saw
a
coming
up
the
road
it
was
deede
dawson
car
and
he
was
driving
it
and
by
his
side
sat
a
stranger
his
air
that
of
one
not
sure
of
his
welcome
but
determined
to
enforce
it
in
whom
with
a
quick
start
dunn
recognized
his
burglar
the
man
whose
attempt
to
break
into
bittermeads
he
had
frustrated
and
whose
place
he
had
taken
he
put
up
his
hand
instinctively
for
them
to
stop
and
deede
dawson
at
once
obeyed
the
gesture
dunn
noticed
that
the
smile
upon
his
lips
was
more
gentle
and
winning
than
ever
the
look
in
his
eyes
more
dark
and
menacing
well
dunn
what
is
it
he
said
as
pleasantly
as
he
always
spoke
mr
allen
he
added
to
his
companion
this
is
my
man
dunn
i
told
you
about
my
gardener
and
chauffeur
and
a
very
industrious
steady
fellow
and
quite
he
seemed
to
lay
a
certain
emphasis
on
the
last
two
words
and
allen
put
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
at
dunn
with
an
odd
mixture
of
familiarity
suspicion
hesitation
and
an
uncertain
assumption
of
superiority
but
with
no
hint
of
recognition
showing
glad
to
hear
it
he
said
you
always
want
to
know
whom
you
can
mr
clive
has
been
murdered
dunn
said
abruptly
poachers
it
is
said
did
you
know
we
heard
about
it
as
we
came
through
the
village
answered
deede
dawson
very
sad
very
dreadful
it
will
be
a
great
shock
to
poor
ella
i
fear
take
the
car
on
to
the
garage
will
you
he
added
he
drove
on
up
the
drive
and
at
the
front
door
they
alighted
and
entered
the
house
together
dunn
followed
and
getting
into
the
car
drove
it
to
the
garage
where
he
busied
himself
cleaning
it
as
he
worked
he
wondered
very
much
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
sudden
appearance
on
terms
of
friendship
with
deede
dawson
of
this
man
allen
whom
he
had
last
seen
trying
to
break
into
the
house
at
night
was
allen
an
accomplice
of
deede
dawson
or
a
dupe
or
more
probably
a
new
recruit
at
any
rate
to
dunn
it
seemed
that
the
crisis
he
had
expected
and
prepared
for
was
now
fast
approaching
and
he
told
himself
that
if
he
had
failed
in
clive
case
those
others
he
was
working
for
he
must
not
fail
to
save
looks
as
if
dawson
plans
were
nearly
ready
he
said
to
himself
well
so
are
he
finished
his
work
and
shutting
the
garage
door
he
was
turning
away
when
he
saw
ella
coming
towards
him
she
was
extremely
pale
and
her
eyes
seemed
larger
than
ever
and
very
bright
against
the
deathly
whiteness
of
her
cheeks
she
was
wearing
a
blouse
that
was
cut
a
little
low
and
he
notice
with
a
kind
of
terror
how
soft
and
round
was
her
throat
like
a
column
of
pale
and
perfect
ivory
he
hoped
she
would
not
speak
to
him
for
he
thought
perhaps
he
could
not
bear
it
if
she
did
but
she
halted
near
by
and
said
this
is
very
dreadful
about
poor
very
he
answered
moodily
why
should
poachers
kill
him
she
asked
why
should
they
want
to
i
do
know
he
answered
watching
not
her
but
her
soft
throat
where
he
could
see
a
pulse
fluttering
perhaps
it
was
poachers
he
added
she
started
violently
and
gave
a
quick
look
that
seemed
to
make
yet
more
certain
the
certainty
he
already
entertained
who
else
could
it
be
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
he
did
not
answer
after
what
seemed
a
long
time
she
said
you
asked
me
a
question
once
do
you
remember
he
shook
his
head
why
do
you
speak
why
ca
you
speak
she
cried
angrily
why
ca
you
say
something
instead
of
just
shaking
your
head
you
see
i
asked
you
so
many
questions
he
said
slowly
perhaps
i
shall
ask
you
some
more
some
day
which
question
do
you
mean
i
mean
when
you
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
met
any
one
who
spoke
in
a
very
shrill
high
whistling
sort
of
voice
do
you
remember
yes
he
said
you
would
tell
well
i
will
now
she
said
i
did
meet
a
man
once
with
a
voice
like
that
do
you
remember
the
night
you
came
here
that
i
drove
away
in
the
car
with
a
you
carried
downstairs
do
i
remember
he
gasped
for
that
memory
and
the
thought
of
how
she
had
driven
away
into
the
night
with
that
grisly
thing
behind
her
on
the
car
had
never
since
left
his
mind
by
night
or
by
day
yes
she
exclaimed
impatiently
why
do
you
keep
staring
so
are
you
as
stupid
as
you
choose
to
look
do
you
remember
i
remember
he
answered
heavily
i
remember
very
well
then
the
man
i
took
that
to
had
a
voice
just
like
that
high
and
shrill
whistling
i
thought
as
much
said
dunn
may
i
ask
you
another
question
she
nodded
may
i
smoke
she
nodded
again
with
a
touch
of
impatience
he
took
a
cigarette
from
his
pocket
and
put
it
in
his
mouth
and
lighted
a
match
but
the
match
when
he
had
lighted
it
he
used
to
put
light
to
a
scrap
of
folded
paper
with
writing
on
it
like
a
note
this
piece
of
paper
he
used
to
light
his
cigarette
with
and
when
he
had
done
so
he
watched
the
paper
burn
to
an
ash
not
dropping
it
to
the
ground
till
the
little
flame
stung
his
fingers
the
ash
that
had
fallen
he
ground
into
the
path
where
they
stood
with
the
heel
of
his
boot
what
have
you
burned
there
she
asked
as
if
she
suspected
it
was
something
of
importance
he
had
destroyed
in
fact
it
was
the
note
that
had
fallen
from
dead
john
clive
hand
wherein
ella
had
asked
him
to
meet
her
at
the
oak
where
he
had
met
his
death
that
bit
of
paper
would
have
been
enough
dunn
thought
to
place
a
harsh
hempen
noose
about
the
soft
white
throat
he
watched
where
the
little
pulse
still
fluttered
up
and
down
but
now
it
was
burnt
and
utterly
destroyed
and
no
one
would
ever
see
it
at
the
thought
he
laughed
and
she
drew
back
very
startled
oh
what
is
the
matter
she
exclaimed
nothing
he
answered
nothing
in
all
the
world
except
that
i
love
chapter
xviii
robert
dunn
enemy
when
he
had
said
this
he
went
a
step
or
two
aside
and
sat
down
on
the
stump
of
a
tree
he
was
very
agitated
and
disturbed
for
he
had
not
in
the
very
least
meant
to
say
such
a
thing
he
had
not
even
known
that
he
really
felt
like
that
it
was
indeed
a
rush
and
power
of
quite
unexpected
passion
that
had
swept
him
away
and
made
him
for
the
moment
lose
all
control
of
himself
ella
showed
much
more
composure
she
had
become
extraordinarily
pale
but
otherwise
she
did
not
appear
in
any
way
agitated
she
remained
silent
her
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
her
only
movement
a
gesture
by
which
she
rubbed
softly
and
in
turn
each
of
her
wrists
as
though
they
hurt
her
well
ca
you
say
something
he
asked
roughly
annoyed
by
her
persistent
silence
i
do
see
that
there
anything
for
me
to
say
she
answered
oh
well
now
then
he
muttered
quite
disconcerted
she
raised
her
eyes
from
the
ground
and
for
the
first
time
looked
full
at
him
in
her
expression
both
curiosity
and
resentment
it
is
perfectly
intolerable
she
said
with
a
heaving
breast
will
you
tell
me
who
you
are
i
told
you
one
thing
he
answered
sullenly
his
eyes
on
fire
i
should
have
thought
that
was
enough
i
tell
you
nothing
i
think
you
are
the
most
horrid
man
i
ever
met
she
cried
and
the
very
very
ugliest
all
that
hair
on
your
face
so
that
no
one
can
see
anything
else
what
are
you
like
when
you
cut
it
off
does
that
matter
he
asked
in
the
same
gruff
and
surly
manner
i
should
think
it
matters
a
good
deal
when
i
ask
you
she
exclaimed
do
you
expect
any
one
to
care
for
a
man
she
has
never
seen
nothing
but
hair
you
hurt
my
wrists
awfully
that
night
she
added
resentfully
and
you
never
even
hinted
you
his
reply
was
unexpected
and
it
disconcerted
her
greatly
and
for
the
first
time
for
he
caught
both
her
wrists
in
his
hands
and
kissed
them
passionately
where
the
cords
had
been
you
must
do
that
please
do
do
that
she
said
quickly
trying
to
release
herself
her
strength
was
nothing
to
his
and
he
stood
up
and
put
his
arm
around
her
and
strained
her
to
him
in
an
embrace
so
passionate
and
powerful
she
could
not
have
resisted
it
though
she
had
wished
to
but
no
thought
of
resistance
came
to
her
since
for
the
moment
she
had
lost
all
consciousness
of
everything
save
the
strange
thrill
of
his
bright
clear
eyes
looking
so
closely
into
hers
of
his
strong
arms
holding
her
so
firmly
he
released
her
or
rather
she
at
last
freed
herself
by
an
effort
he
did
not
oppose
and
she
fled
away
down
the
path
she
had
an
impression
that
her
hair
would
come
down
and
that
that
would
make
her
look
a
fright
and
she
put
up
her
hands
hurriedly
to
secure
it
she
never
looked
back
to
where
he
stood
breathing
heavily
and
looking
after
her
and
thinking
not
of
her
but
of
two
dead
men
whom
he
had
seen
of
late
shall
i
make
the
third
he
wondered
i
do
not
care
if
i
do
not
the
path
ella
had
fled
by
led
into
another
along
which
when
she
reached
it
she
saw
deede
dawson
coming
she
stopped
at
once
and
began
to
busy
herself
with
a
overrun
with
weeds
but
she
could
not
entirely
conceal
her
agitation
from
her
stepfather
cold
grey
eyes
oh
there
you
are
ella
he
said
with
all
that
false
geniality
of
his
that
filled
the
girl
with
such
loathing
and
distrust
have
you
seen
dunn
oh
there
he
is
is
he
i
wanted
to
ask
you
ella
what
do
you
think
of
dunn
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
towards
where
dunn
stood
and
she
managed
to
answer
with
a
passable
air
of
indifference
well
i
suppose
she
said
that
he
is
quite
the
ugliest
man
i
ever
saw
of
course
if
he
cut
all
of
that
hair
off
deede
dawson
laughed
though
his
eyes
remained
as
hard
and
cold
as
ever
i
shall
have
to
give
him
orders
to
shave
he
said
your
mother
was
telling
me
i
ought
to
the
other
day
she
said
it
did
look
respectable
to
have
a
man
about
with
all
that
hair
on
his
face
though
i
do
see
myself
why
hair
is
respectable
do
you
it
looks
odd
answered
ella
carelessly
deede
dawson
laughed
again
and
walked
on
to
where
dunn
was
standing
waiting
for
him
with
his
perpetual
smile
that
his
cold
and
evil
eyes
so
strangely
contradicted
he
said
to
him
well
what
have
you
and
ella
been
talking
about
why
do
you
ask
growled
dunn
because
she
looks
upset
answered
deede
dawson
oh
do
be
shy
about
it
shall
i
give
you
a
little
good
advice
what
never
why
not
because
that
thick
growth
of
hair
hiding
your
face
gives
you
an
air
of
mystery
and
romance
no
woman
could
possibly
resist
you
a
perpetual
puzzle
and
to
pique
a
woman
curiosity
is
the
surest
way
to
interest
her
why
there
are
plenty
of
women
who
would
marry
you
simply
to
find
out
what
is
under
all
that
hair
so
never
you
i
do
mean
unless
of
course
you
have
to
for
purposes
of
disguise
for
i
thought
you
were
hinting
that
the
beard
itself
was
a
disguise
retorted
dunn
removing
it
might
become
a
better
one
answered
deede
dawson
you
told
me
once
you
knew
this
part
fairly
well
do
you
know
wreste
abbey
dunn
gave
his
questioner
a
scowling
look
that
seemed
full
of
anger
and
suspicion
what
about
it
if
i
do
he
asked
i
am
asking
if
you
do
know
it
said
deede
dawson
yes
i
do
well
it
belongs
to
lord
chobham
does
it
dunn
nodded
old
man
is
he
i
not
a
book
of
reference
about
lord
chobham
answered
dunn
if
you
want
to
know
his
age
you
can
easily
find
out
i
suppose
what
the
sense
of
asking
me
a
lot
of
questions
like
that
he
has
no
family
and
his
heir
is
his
younger
brother
general
dunsmore
who
has
one
son
rupert
i
believe
do
you
know
if
that
so
look
here
said
dunn
speaking
with
a
great
appearance
of
anger
do
you
go
too
far
or
maybe
something
you
wo
like
will
happen
if
you
anything
to
say
say
it
straight
out
or
there
be
deede
dawson
seemed
a
little
surprised
at
the
vehemence
of
the
tone
what
the
matter
he
asked
do
you
like
the
family
or
upsetting
you
dunn
seemed
almost
choking
with
fury
he
one
hand
and
let
it
fall
again
if
ever
i
get
hold
of
that
young
rupert
dunsmore
he
said
with
a
little
gasp
for
breath
if
ever
i
come
face
to
face
with
him
man
to
man
dear
me
smiled
deede
dawson
lifting
his
eyebrows
i
treading
on
sore
toes
it
seems
what
the
trouble
between
you
never
you
mind
replied
dunn
roughly
that
my
business
but
no
man
ever
had
a
worse
enemy
than
he
been
to
has
he
though
said
deede
dawson
who
seemed
very
interested
and
even
a
little
excited
what
did
he
do
never
you
mind
dunn
repeated
that
my
affair
but
i
swore
i
get
even
with
him
some
day
and
i
will
suppose
said
deede
dawson
suppose
i
showed
you
a
way
dunn
did
not
answer
at
first
and
for
some
moments
the
two
men
stood
watching
each
other
and
staring
into
each
other
eyes
as
though
each
was
trying
to
read
the
depths
of
the
other
soul
suppose
said
deede
dawson
very
softly
suppose
you
were
to
meet
rupert
dunsmore
alone
quite
alone
still
dunn
did
not
answer
but
somehow
it
appeared
that
his
silence
was
full
of
a
very
deadly
significance
suppose
you
did
what
would
you
do
murmured
deede
dawson
again
and
his
voice
sank
lower
with
each
word
he
uttered
till
the
last
was
a
whisper
dunn
stopped
and
picked
up
a
hoe
that
was
lying
near
by
he
placed
the
tough
ash
handle
across
his
knee
and
with
a
movement
of
his
powerful
hands
he
broke
the
hoe
across
the
two
smashed
pieces
he
dropped
on
the
ground
and
looking
at
deede
dawson
he
said
like
that
if
ever
rupert
dunsmore
and
i
meet
alone
only
one
of
us
will
go
away
and
he
confirmed
it
with
an
oath
deede
dawson
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
laughed
good
he
cried
why
you
the
man
i
been
looking
for
for
a
long
time
the
fact
is
rupert
dunsmore
played
me
a
nasty
trick
once
and
i
want
to
clear
accounts
with
him
now
suppose
i
show
him
to
you
you
do
that
said
dunn
and
he
repeated
the
oath
he
had
sworn
before
you
show
him
to
me
and
i
take
care
he
never
troubles
any
one
that
the
way
i
like
to
hear
a
man
talk
cried
deede
dawson
dunsmore
has
been
away
for
a
time
on
business
i
can
make
a
guess
at
but
he
is
coming
back
soon
should
you
know
him
if
you
saw
him
should
i
know
him
repeated
dunn
contemptuously
should
i
know
myself
that
good
said
deede
dawson
again
by
the
way
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
has
lord
chobham
a
rather
distant
cousin
walter
dunsmore
living
with
him
as
secretary
or
something
of
the
sort
quite
a
distant
relative
i
believe
though
in
the
direct
line
of
succession
very
likely
said
dunn
indifferently
i
think
so
but
i
do
care
anything
about
the
rest
of
them
it
only
rupert
dunsmore
i
have
anything
chapter
xix
the
visit
to
wreste
abbey
it
was
a
little
later
when
deede
dawson
returned
to
the
subject
of
wreste
abbey
lord
chobham
has
a
very
valuable
collection
of
plate
and
jewellery
and
so
on
has
he
he
asked
oh
there
plenty
of
the
stuff
there
dunn
answered
why
oh
i
was
thinking
a
visit
might
be
made
fairly
profitable
deede
dawson
said
carelessly
for
the
first
time
definitely
throwing
off
his
mask
of
citizen
under
which
he
lived
at
bittermeads
it
would
be
a
risky
job
answered
dunn
showing
no
surprise
at
the
suggestion
the
stuff
well
guarded
and
then
that
not
what
thinking
about
it
meeting
rupert
dunsmore
man
to
man
and
no
one
to
come
between
us
if
that
ever
happens
deede
dawson
nodded
reassuringly
that
be
all
right
he
said
so
you
shall
i
promise
you
that
but
we
might
as
well
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
and
clear
a
bit
of
profit
too
i
got
to
live
like
any
one
else
and
i
have
five
thousand
a
year
of
my
own
so
i
get
my
living
out
of
those
who
have
and
i
do
see
who
has
any
right
to
blame
me
mind
if
there
was
any
money
in
chess
i
should
be
a
millionaire
but
there
is
and
if
a
man
can
make
a
fortune
on
the
stock
exchange
which
takes
no
more
thought
or
skill
than
why
should
i
make
a
bit
when
i
can
there
the
gambit
i
invented
people
will
be
studying
and
playing
for
centuries
but
it
never
bring
me
a
penny
for
all
the
i
put
into
it
and
so
i
got
to
protect
myself
have
i
it
what
i
do
with
less
talk
about
it
answered
dunn
contemptuously
why
i
guessed
all
that
from
the
first
when
you
were
so
keen
on
seeing
me
in
gaol
as
most
of
your
honest
lot
who
only
do
their
swindling
in
would
have
been
and
kept
my
eyes
open
of
course
it
was
hard
to
twig
you
did
a
bit
on
the
cross
yourself
well
that
your
affair
but
one
thing
i
do
want
to
know
how
much
does
miss
cayley
know
for
all
his
efforts
he
could
not
keep
his
anxiety
entirely
out
of
his
voice
as
he
said
this
and
recognizing
that
thereby
he
had
perhaps
risked
rousing
some
suspicion
in
the
other
mind
he
added
and
her
mother
the
young
lady
and
her
mother
how
much
do
they
know
oh
answered
deede
dawson
with
his
false
laugh
and
eyes
my
wife
knows
nothing
at
all
but
ella
the
best
helper
ever
had
she
looks
so
innocent
she
can
take
in
any
one
and
she
never
gives
the
show
away
she
acts
all
the
time
a
wonderful
girl
and
useful
you
hardly
believe
how
dunn
did
not
answer
it
was
only
by
a
supreme
effort
that
he
kept
his
hands
from
deede
dawson
throat
he
did
not
believe
a
word
of
what
the
other
said
for
he
knew
well
the
utter
falseness
of
the
man
none
the
less
the
accusation
troubled
him
and
chilled
him
to
the
heart
as
though
with
the
touch
of
the
finger
of
death
you
remember
that
deede
dawson
added
the
one
you
helped
me
to
get
away
from
here
the
night
you
came
well
she
knew
what
was
in
it
though
you
would
never
have
thought
so
to
look
at
her
would
you
his
cold
eyes
were
very
intent
and
keen
as
he
said
this
and
dunn
thought
to
himself
that
it
had
been
said
more
to
test
any
possible
knowledge
or
suspicion
of
his
own
than
for
any
other
reason
with
a
manner
of
only
slight
interest
he
answered
carelessly
did
she
why
was
it
your
stuff
had
it
been
pinched
but
she
was
safe
enough
the
police
would
never
stop
a
smart
young
lady
in
a
except
on
very
strong
perhaps
not
agreed
deede
dawson
that
one
reason
why
ella
so
useful
but
i
been
thinking
things
out
and
trying
to
make
them
work
in
together
and
i
think
the
first
thing
to
do
is
for
you
to
drive
allen
and
ella
over
to
wreste
abbey
this
afternoon
so
that
they
may
have
a
good
look
oh
miss
cayley
and
allen
dunn
muttered
the
allen
had
been
making
himself
very
much
at
home
at
bittermeads
since
his
arrival
though
he
had
not
so
far
troubled
to
any
great
extent
either
ella
in
the
house
or
dunn
outside
his
idea
of
comfort
seemed
to
be
to
stay
in
bed
very
late
and
spend
his
time
when
he
did
get
up
in
the
in
the
company
of
a
box
of
cigars
and
a
bottle
of
whisky
the
suggestion
that
he
and
ella
should
pay
a
visit
together
to
wreste
abbey
was
one
that
greatly
surprised
dunn
all
right
he
said
this
afternoon
i
get
the
car
this
is
the
afternoon
the
abbey
is
thrown
open
to
visitors
is
it
asked
deede
dawson
allen
and
ella
can
get
in
as
tourists
and
have
a
good
look
round
and
you
can
look
round
outside
and
get
to
know
the
lie
of
the
land
there
wo
be
long
to
wait
for
rupert
dunsmore
will
be
back
from
his
little
excursion
before
long
i
he
laughed
in
his
mirthless
way
and
walked
off
and
dunn
as
he
got
the
car
ready
seemed
a
good
deal
preoccupied
and
a
little
worried
how
can
he
know
that
rupert
dunsmore
is
coming
back
he
said
to
himself
can
he
have
any
way
of
finding
out
things
i
do
know
about
and
if
he
did
how
could
he
know
that
most
likely
it
only
a
guess
to
soothe
me
down
and
he
does
really
know
anything
at
all
about
after
lunch
allen
and
ella
appeared
together
ready
for
their
expedition
ella
looked
her
best
in
a
big
motoring
coat
and
a
hat
with
a
long
blue
veil
allen
was
for
almost
the
first
time
since
his
arrival
shaved
washed
and
tidy
he
looked
indeed
as
respectable
as
his
sinister
and
forbidding
countenance
would
permit
and
though
deede
dawson
had
made
him
as
smart
as
possible
he
had
permitted
him
to
gratify
his
own
florid
taste
in
adornment
so
that
his
air
of
prosperity
and
wealth
had
the
appearance
of
being
that
of
some
vulgarian
whose
association
with
a
and
a
girl
of
ella
type
was
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
he
had
recently
purchased
them
both
out
of
wealth
dunn
wore
a
neat
chauffeur
costume
with
which
however
his
bearded
face
did
not
go
too
well
he
felt
indeed
that
their
whole
was
far
too
conspicuous
considering
the
real
nature
of
their
errand
and
far
too
likely
to
attract
attention
and
he
wondered
if
deede
subtle
and
calculating
mind
had
not
for
some
private
reason
desired
that
to
be
so
he
is
keeping
well
in
the
background
himself
dunn
mused
he
may
reckon
that
if
things
go
wrong
in
case
of
any
pursuit
it
a
good
move
perhaps
in
a
way
but
he
may
find
an
unexpected
check
to
his
king
opened
on
the
drive
was
a
long
one
and
ella
noticed
that
though
dunn
consulted
his
map
frequently
he
never
appeared
in
any
doubt
concerning
the
way
a
little
before
three
they
drove
into
the
village
that
lay
round
the
park
gates
of
wreste
abbey
motors
were
not
allowed
in
the
park
so
dunn
put
theirs
in
the
garage
of
the
little
hotel
that
was
already
almost
full
for
visiting
day
at
wreste
abbey
generally
drew
a
goodly
number
of
tourists
while
ella
and
allen
in
odd
companionship
walked
up
to
the
abbey
by
the
famous
approach
through
the
chestnut
avenue
allen
was
quiet
and
surly
and
much
on
his
guard
and
very
uncomfortable
in
ella
company
and
ella
herself
though
for
different
reasons
was
equally
silent
but
the
beauty
of
the
walk
through
the
chestnut
avenue
and
of
the
vista
with
the
great
house
at
the
end
drew
from
her
a
quick
exclamation
of
delight
how
beautiful
a
place
this
is
she
said
aloud
and
how
peaceful
and
how
do
like
these
quiet
places
myself
grumbled
allen
do
like
do
trust
give
me
lots
of
traffic
when
everything
so
awful
quiet
you
only
got
to
kick
your
foot
against
a
stone
or
drop
a
tool
and
likely
as
not
you
wake
the
whole
blessed
wake
repeated
ella
noticing
the
word
and
she
repeated
it
with
emphasis
why
do
you
say
chapter
xx
ella
warning
ella
did
not
say
anything
more
and
in
their
character
of
tourists
visiting
the
place
they
were
admitted
to
the
abbey
and
passed
on
through
its
magnificent
rooms
where
was
stored
a
collection
rich
and
rare
even
for
one
of
the
stateliest
homes
of
england
what
a
wonderful
place
ella
sighed
wistfully
yet
she
could
not
enjoy
the
spectacle
of
all
these
treasures
as
she
would
have
done
at
another
time
for
she
was
always
watching
allen
who
hung
about
a
good
deal
and
seemed
to
look
more
at
the
locks
of
the
cases
that
held
some
of
the
more
valuable
of
the
objects
shown
than
at
the
things
themselves
and
generally
spent
fully
half
the
time
in
each
room
at
the
window
admiring
the
view
he
said
but
for
quite
another
reason
ella
suspected
i
shall
speak
when
i
get
back
she
said
to
herself
pale
and
resolute
i
do
care
what
happens
i
do
care
if
i
have
to
tell
mother
perhaps
she
knows
already
anyhow
i
shall
having
come
to
this
determination
she
grew
cheerful
and
more
interested
apparently
in
what
they
were
seeing
as
well
as
less
watchful
of
her
companion
when
presently
they
left
the
house
to
go
into
the
gardens
it
happened
that
they
noticed
an
old
gentleman
walking
at
a
little
distance
behind
a
gate
marked
private
and
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
tall
thin
man
of
lord
chobham
the
old
gentleman
whispered
a
tourist
who
was
standing
near
i
saw
him
once
in
the
house
of
lords
that
his
secretary
with
him
dunsmore
one
of
the
family
he
manages
everything
now
the
old
gentleman
is
getting
so
ella
walked
on
frowning
and
a
little
worried
for
she
thought
she
had
seen
the
secretary
before
and
yet
could
not
remember
where
soon
she
noticed
dunn
who
had
apparently
been
obeying
deede
dawson
orders
to
look
round
outside
and
get
to
know
the
lie
of
the
land
he
seemed
at
present
to
be
a
good
deal
interested
in
lord
chobham
and
his
companion
for
he
went
and
leaned
on
the
gate
and
stared
at
them
so
rudely
that
one
or
two
of
the
other
tourists
noticed
it
and
frowned
at
him
but
he
took
no
notice
and
presently
as
if
not
seeing
that
the
gate
was
marked
private
he
pushed
it
open
and
walked
through
noticing
the
impertinent
intrusion
almost
at
once
dunsmore
turned
round
and
called
this
is
dunn
did
not
seem
to
hear
and
dunsmore
walked
across
to
him
with
a
very
impatient
air
while
the
little
group
of
tourists
watched
with
much
interest
and
indignation
and
a
very
comforting
sense
of
superiority
he
ought
to
be
sent
right
out
of
the
grounds
they
told
each
other
that
the
sort
of
rude
behaviour
other
people
have
to
suffer
now
my
man
said
dunsmore
sharply
this
is
private
you
no
business
sorry
sir
beg
pardon
i
sure
said
dunn
touching
his
hat
and
as
he
did
so
he
said
in
a
sharp
penetrating
whisper
look
out
brewing
do
know
what
but
look
out
all
the
he
had
spoken
so
quickly
and
quietly
in
the
very
act
of
turning
away
that
none
of
the
onlookers
could
have
told
that
a
word
had
passed
but
for
the
very
violent
start
that
walter
dunsmore
made
and
his
quick
movement
forward
as
if
to
follow
the
other
immediately
dunn
turned
back
towards
him
with
a
swift
warning
gesture
of
his
hand
careful
you
fool
they
looking
he
said
in
a
quick
whisper
and
in
a
loud
voice
very
sorry
sir
beg
pardon
i
sure
i
did
mean
walter
dunsmore
swung
round
upon
his
heel
and
went
quickly
back
to
where
lord
chobham
waited
and
his
face
was
like
that
of
one
who
has
gazed
into
the
very
eyes
of
death
lord
in
heaven
he
muttered
it
all
over
i
and
his
hand
felt
for
a
little
metal
box
he
carried
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
that
held
half
a
dozen
small
round
tablets
each
of
them
a
strong
death
but
he
took
his
hand
away
again
as
he
rejoined
his
cousin
patron
and
employer
old
lord
chobham
what
the
matter
walter
lord
chobham
asked
you
look
the
fellow
was
a
bit
impudent
he
made
me
angry
said
walter
carelessly
he
fingered
the
little
box
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
thought
how
one
tablet
on
his
tongue
would
always
end
it
all
by
the
way
ought
rupert
to
be
back
soon
he
asked
yes
he
ought
said
lord
chobham
severely
it
time
he
married
and
settled
down
i
shall
speak
to
his
father
about
it
the
boy
is
always
rushing
off
somewhere
or
another
when
he
ought
to
be
getting
to
know
the
estate
and
the
walter
dunsmore
laughed
i
think
he
knows
them
both
fairly
well
already
he
said
not
a
tenant
on
the
place
but
swears
by
rupert
he
a
fine
fellow
oh
you
always
stick
up
for
him
you
and
he
were
always
friends
answered
lord
chobham
in
a
grumbling
tone
but
really
very
pleased
i
know
i
never
allowed
to
say
a
word
about
well
he
a
fine
fellow
and
a
good
friend
said
walter
and
the
two
disappeared
into
the
house
by
a
small
as
dunn
pushed
his
way
through
the
group
of
tourists
who
looked
at
him
with
marked
and
severe
disapproval
disgraceful
one
of
them
said
quite
loudly
and
another
added
i
believe
he
said
something
impudent
to
that
gentleman
i
saw
him
go
quite
white
and
look
as
if
he
were
in
two
minds
about
ordering
the
fellow
right
out
of
the
and
a
third
expressed
the
general
opinion
that
the
culprit
looked
a
real
ruffian
with
all
that
hair
on
his
face
might
be
a
gorilla
said
the
third
tourist
and
look
what
a
clumsy
sort
of
walk
he
has
perhaps
he
been
but
dunn
was
quite
indifferent
to
and
indeed
unaware
of
this
popular
condemnation
as
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
hotel
garage
where
he
had
left
their
car
he
seemed
rather
well
pleased
than
otherwise
as
he
walked
on
quite
a
stroke
of
luck
for
once
he
mused
and
he
smiled
to
himself
and
stroked
the
thick
growth
of
his
untidy
beard
it
been
worth
while
for
he
did
recognize
me
in
the
least
and
had
quite
a
shock
but
all
the
same
i
sha
be
sorry
to
shave
and
see
my
own
face
he
had
the
car
out
and
ready
when
ella
and
allen
came
back
allen
at
once
made
an
excuse
to
leave
them
and
went
into
the
hotel
bar
to
get
a
drink
of
whisky
and
when
they
were
alone
ella
who
was
looking
very
troubled
and
thoughtful
said
to
dunn
we
saw
lord
chobham
in
the
garden
with
a
gentleman
some
one
told
us
was
a
relative
of
his
a
walter
dunsmore
did
you
see
them
yes
answered
dunn
a
little
surprised
and
giving
her
a
quick
and
searching
look
from
his
bright
keen
eyes
i
saw
them
why
i
think
i
seen
the
one
they
said
was
walter
dunsmore
before
and
i
ca
think
where
she
answered
puckering
her
brows
i
think
do
you
know
anything
about
him
i
know
he
is
walter
dunsmore
answered
dunn
slowly
and
i
know
he
is
one
of
the
family
and
a
great
friend
of
rupert
dunsmore
rupert
dunsmore
is
lord
chobham
nephew
you
know
and
heir
after
his
father
to
the
title
and
estates
his
father
general
dunsmore
brought
him
and
walter
up
together
like
brothers
but
recently
walter
has
lived
at
the
abbey
as
lord
chobham
secretary
and
companion
the
general
likes
to
live
abroad
a
good
deal
and
his
son
rupert
is
always
away
on
some
sporting
or
exploring
expedition
or
it
very
strange
ella
said
again
i
sure
i
seen
walter
dunsmore
before
but
i
ca
think
allen
came
from
the
bar
having
quenched
his
thirst
for
the
time
being
and
they
started
off
arriving
back
at
bittermeads
fairly
early
in
the
evening
for
dunn
had
brought
them
along
at
a
good
rate
and
apparently
remembered
the
road
so
well
from
the
afternoon
that
he
never
once
had
occasion
to
refer
to
the
map
he
took
the
car
round
to
the
garage
and
allen
and
ella
went
into
the
house
where
allen
made
his
way
at
once
to
the
searching
for
more
whisky
and
cigars
while
ella
after
a
quick
word
with
her
mother
to
assure
her
of
their
safe
return
went
to
find
deede
dawson
ah
dear
child
you
are
back
then
he
greeted
her
well
how
have
you
enjoyed
yourself
had
a
pleasant
time
it
was
not
for
pleasure
we
went
there
i
think
she
said
listlessly
he
looked
up
quickly
and
though
his
perpetual
smile
still
played
as
usual
about
his
lips
his
eyes
were
hard
and
daunting
as
they
fixed
themselves
on
hers
before
that
sinister
stare
her
own
eyes
sank
and
sought
the
little
travelling
set
of
chessmen
and
board
that
were
before
him
see
he
said
i
just
brought
off
a
mate
neat
is
it
she
looked
up
at
him
and
her
eyes
were
steadier
now
i
only
one
thing
to
say
to
you
she
said
i
came
here
to
say
it
if
anything
happens
at
wreste
abbey
i
shall
go
straight
to
the
indeed
he
said
he
fingered
the
chessmen
as
though
all
his
attention
were
engaged
by
them
may
i
ask
why
he
murmured
for
what
purpose
to
tell
them
she
answered
quietly
what
i
and
what
do
you
know
he
asked
indifferently
what
do
you
know
that
is
likely
to
interest
the
police
i
ought
to
have
said
perhaps
she
answered
after
a
pause
what
i
ah
that
so
different
is
it
he
murmured
gently
so
very
different
you
see
we
all
of
us
suspect
so
many
she
did
not
answer
for
she
had
said
all
she
had
to
say
and
she
was
afraid
that
her
strength
would
not
carry
her
further
she
began
to
walk
away
but
he
called
her
back
oh
how
do
you
think
your
mother
is
today
he
asked
do
you
know
her
condition
seems
to
me
quite
serious
at
times
i
wonder
if
you
are
overanxious
she
is
better
much
better
ella
answered
and
added
with
a
sudden
burst
of
fiercest
passion
but
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
we
had
both
died
before
we
met
she
hurried
away
for
she
was
afraid
of
breaking
down
and
deede
dawson
smiled
the
more
as
he
again
turned
his
attention
to
his
chessmen
taking
them
up
and
putting
them
down
in
turn
she
turning
nasty
he
mused
i
do
think
she
dare
but
she
might
she
only
a
pawn
but
a
pawn
can
cause
a
lot
of
trouble
at
times
a
pawn
may
become
a
queen
and
give
the
mate
when
a
pawn
threatens
trouble
it
best
to
remove
he
went
out
and
came
back
a
little
late
and
busied
himself
with
a
chess
problem
which
absorbed
all
his
attention
and
which
he
did
not
solve
to
his
satisfaction
till
past
midnight
then
he
went
upstairs
to
bed
but
at
the
door
of
his
room
he
paused
and
went
on
very
softly
up
the
narrow
stairs
that
led
to
the
attics
above
outside
the
one
in
which
dunn
slept
he
waited
a
little
till
the
unbroken
sound
of
regular
breathing
from
within
assured
him
that
the
occupant
slept
cautiously
and
carefully
he
crept
on
and
entered
the
one
adjoining
where
he
turned
the
light
of
the
electric
flashlight
he
carried
on
a
large
empty
that
stood
in
one
corner
with
a
rule
he
took
from
his
pocket
he
measured
it
carefully
and
nodded
with
great
satisfaction
a
little
smaller
than
the
other
he
said
to
himself
but
then
it
has
got
to
hold
so
he
laughed
in
his
silent
mirthless
way
as
at
something
that
amused
him
a
good
deal
less
he
thought
and
dunn
shall
he
laughed
again
and
for
a
moment
or
two
stood
there
in
the
darkness
laughing
silently
to
himself
and
then
speaking
aloud
he
called
out
you
can
come
in
dunn
whom
a
creaking
board
had
betrayed
came
forward
unconcernedly
in
his
sleeping
attire

saw

remarked
at
first

deede

thoughtfully
chapter
xxi
doubts
and
fears
in
point
of
fact
dunn
had
not
been
asleep
when
deede
dawson
came
listening
at
his
door
of
late
he
had
slept
little
and
that
little
had
been
much
disturbed
by
evil
haunting
dreams
in
which
perpetually
he
saw
his
dead
friend
charley
wright
and
dead
john
clive
always
together
while
behind
them
floated
the
pale
and
lovely
face
of
ella
at
whom
the
two
dead
men
looked
and
whispered
to
each
other
in
the
day
such
thoughts
troubled
him
less
for
when
he
was
under
the
influence
of
ella
gentle
presence
and
when
he
could
watch
her
clear
and
candid
eyes
he
found
all
doubt
and
suspicion
melting
away
like
snow
beneath
warm
sunshine
but
in
the
silence
of
the
night
they
returned
returned
very
dreadfully
so
dreadfully
that
often
as
he
lay
awake
in
the
darkness
beads
of
sweat
stood
upon
his
forehead
and
he
would
drive
his
great
hands
one
against
the
other
in
his
passionate
effort
to
still
the
thoughts
that
tormented
him
then
in
the
morning
again
the
sound
of
ella
voice
the
merest
glimpse
of
her
grave
and
gracious
personality
would
bring
back
once
more
his
instinctive
belief
in
her
the
morning
after
deede
dawson
had
paid
his
visit
to
the
attic
there
was
news
however
that
disturbed
him
greatly
for
barker
the
charwoman
who
came
each
morning
to
bittermeads
told
them
that
two
men
in
the
village
notorious
poachers
had
been
arrested
by
the
police
on
a
charge
of
being
concerned
in
clive
death
the
news
was
a
great
shock
to
dunn
for
knowing
as
he
thought
he
did
that
the
police
were
working
on
an
entirely
wrong
idea
he
had
not
supposed
they
would
ever
find
themselves
able
to
make
any
arrest
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
arrests
they
had
made
were
the
result
of
desperation
on
the
part
of
the
police
who
unable
to
discover
anything
and
entirely
absorbed
by
their
preconceived
idea
that
the
crime
was
the
work
of
poachers
had
arrested
men
they
knew
were
poachers
in
the
vague
hope
of
somehow
discovering
something
or
of
somehow
getting
hold
of
some
useful
clue
but
that
dunn
did
not
know
and
feared
unlucky
chance
or
undesigned
coincidence
must
have
appeared
to
suggest
the
guilt
of
the
men
and
that
they
were
really
in
actual
danger
of
trial
and
conviction
he
had
too
received
that
morning
through
the
secret
means
of
communication
he
kept
open
with
an
agent
in
london
conclusive
proof
that
at
the
moment
of
clive
death
deede
dawson
was
in
town
on
business
that
seemed
obscure
enough
but
none
the
less
in
town
and
therefore
undoubtedly
innocent
of
the
actual
perpetration
of
the
murder
who
then
was
left
who
could
have
fired
the
fatal
shot
it
was
a
question
dunn
dared
not
even
ask
himself
but
he
saw
very
plainly
that
if
the
proceedings
against
the
two
arrested
men
were
to
be
pressed
he
would
be
forced
to
come
forward
before
his
preparations
were
ready
and
tell
all
he
knew
no
matter
at
what
cost
all
the
morning
he
waited
and
watched
for
his
opportunity
to
speak
to
ella
who
was
in
a
brighter
and
gayer
mood
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
in
before
at
breakfast
deede
dawson
had
assured
her
that
he
could
not
conceive
what
were
the
suspicions
she
had
referred
to
the
night
previously
and
while
he
would
certainly
have
no
objection
to
her
mentioning
them
at
any
time
in
any
quarter
she
thought
fit
if
anything
happened
at
wreste
abbey
and
would
indeed
be
the
first
to
urge
her
to
do
so
he
for
his
part
considered
it
most
unlikely
that
anything
of
the
sort
she
seemed
to
dread
would
in
fact
occur
not
at
all
likely
he
said
with
his
happy
beaming
smile
that
never
reached
those
cold
eyes
of
his
i
should
say
myself
that
nothing
ever
did
happen
at
wreste
abbey
not
since
the
flood
anyhow
it
strikes
me
as
the
most
peaceful
secluded
spot
in
all
i
very
glad
you
think
so
said
ella
tremendously
relieved
and
glad
to
hear
him
say
so
and
supposing
though
his
smooth
words
and
smiles
and
protestations
deceived
her
very
little
that
at
any
rate
what
she
had
said
had
forced
him
to
abandon
whatever
plans
he
had
been
forming
in
that
direction
her
victory
as
it
seemed
to
her
won
so
easily
and
containing
good
promise
of
further
success
in
the
future
cheered
her
immensely
and
it
was
in
almost
a
happy
mood
that
she
went
unto
the
garden
after
lunch
and
met
dunn
in
a
quiet
corner
where
he
had
been
waiting
and
watching
for
long
his
appearance
startled
her
his
eyes
were
so
wild
his
whole
manner
so
strained
and
restless
and
she
gave
a
little
dismayed
exclamation
as
she
saw
him
oh
what
the
matter
she
asked
are
you
well
you
look
she
paused
for
she
did
not
know
exactly
how
it
was
he
did
look
and
he
said
in
his
harshest
most
abrupt
manner
do
you
remember
charley
wright
why
do
you
ask
she
said
puzzled
is
anything
wrong
do
you
remember
john
clive
he
asked
disregarding
this
have
you
heard
two
men
have
been
arrested
for
his
murder
mrs
barker
told
me
so
she
answered
gravely
he
came
a
little
nearer
almost
threateningly
nearer
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
asked
she
lifted
one
hand
and
put
it
gently
on
his
arm
the
touch
of
it
thrilled
him
through
and
through
and
he
felt
a
little
dazed
as
he
watched
it
resting
on
his
coat
sleeve
she
had
become
very
pale
also
and
her
voice
was
low
and
strained
as
she
said
have
you
had
suspicions
too
he
looked
at
her
as
if
fascinated
for
a
moment
and
then
nodded
twice
and
very
slowly
so
have
i
she
sighed
in
tones
so
low
he
could
scarcely
hear
them
oh
you
you
also
he
muttered
almost
suffocating
yes
she
said
yes
perhaps
the
same
as
yours
my
stepfather
she
breathed
mr
deede
he
watched
her
closely
and
moodily
but
he
did
not
speak
i
was
afraid
at
first
she
whispered
but
i
was
wrong
quite
wrong
it
is
as
certain
as
it
can
be
that
he
was
in
london
at
the
from
his
pocket
dunn
took
out
the
handkerchief
of
hers
that
he
had
found
near
the
body
of
the
dead
man
is
this
yours
he
asked
yes
she
answered
yes
where
did
you
get
it
he
did
not
answer
but
he
lifted
his
hands
one
after
the
other
and
put
them
on
her
shoulder
with
the
fingers
outspread
to
encircle
her
throat
it
seemed
to
him
that
when
she
acknowledged
the
ownership
of
the
handkerchief
she
acknowledged
also
the
perpetration
of
the
deed
and
he
became
a
little
mad
and
he
had
it
in
his
mind
that
the
slightest
the
very
slightest
pressure
of
his
fingers
on
that
soft
round
throat
would
put
it
for
ever
out
of
her
power
to
do
such
things
again
then
for
himself
death
would
be
easy
and
welcome
and
there
would
be
an
end
to
all
these
doubts
and
fears
that
racked
him
with
anguish
beyond
bearing
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
making
no
attempt
to
resist
or
escape
ever
so
slightly
the
pressure
of
his
hands
upon
her
throat
strengthened
and
increased
a
very
little
more
and
the
lovely
thing
of
life
he
watched
would
be
broken
and
cold
for
ever
her
eyes
were
steady
she
showed
no
sign
of
fear
she
stood
perfectly
still
her
hands
loosely
clasped
together
before
her
he
groaned
and
his
arms
fell
to
his
side
helpless
without
the
slightest
change
of
expression
she
said
what
were
you
going
to
do
i
do
know
he
answered
do
you
ever
go
mad
i
do
i
think
perhaps
you
do
too
and
that
explains
it
do
you
know
where
charley
wright
is
yes
she
answered
directly
why
did
you
know
him
then
you
know
where
he
is
now
dunn
repeated
she
nodded
quietly
i
heard
from
him
only
last
week
she
said
i
am
certainly
mad
or
you
are
he
muttered
staring
at
her
with
eyes
in
which
such
wonder
and
horror
showed
that
it
seemed
there
really
was
a
touch
of
madness
there
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
you
heard
from
him
last
week
he
said
again
and
again
she
answered
yes
last
week
why
not
he
leaned
forward
and
before
she
knew
what
he
intended
to
do
he
kissed
her
pale
cool
cheek
once
more
she
stood
still
and
immobile
her
hands
loosely
clasped
before
her
it
might
have
been
that
he
had
kissed
a
statue
and
her
perfect
stillness
made
him
afraid
ella
he
said
why
did
you
do
that
she
said
a
little
wildly
now
in
her
turn
it
was
not
that
you
were
going
to
do
to
me
i
love
you
he
muttered
excusingly
she
shook
her
head
you
know
too
little
of
me
you
have
too
many
doubt
and
fears
she
said
you
do
not
love
me
you
do
not
even
trust
i
love
you
all
the
same
he
asserted
positively
and
roughly
i
loved
you
it
was
when
i
tied
your
hands
to
the
chair
that
night
and
you
looked
at
me
with
such
contempt
and
asked
me
if
i
felt
proud
that
stung
that
stung
i
loved
you
you
see
she
said
sadly
you
do
not
even
pretend
to
trust
me
i
know
why
you
should
why
are
you
here
why
are
you
disguised
with
all
that
growth
of
hair
there
is
something
you
are
preparing
planning
i
know
it
i
feel
it
what
is
it
i
told
you
once
before
he
answered
that
the
end
of
this
will
be
deede
dawson
death
or
mine
that
what
i
he
is
very
cunning
very
clever
she
said
do
you
think
he
suspects
you
he
suspects
every
one
always
answered
dunn
i
been
trying
to
get
proof
to
act
on
i
have
succeeded
not
yet
nothing
definite
if
i
ca
i
shall
act
without
that
if
i
told
him
even
half
of
what
you
just
said
she
said
looking
at
him
what
would
happen
you
see
i
trust
you
he
answered
bitterly
she
shook
her
head
but
her
eyes
were
soft
and
tender
as
she
said
it
was
trust
in
me
made
you
say
all
that
it
was
because
you
care
what
happened
no
he
said
but
when
i
see
you
i
forget
everything
do
you
love
me
why
i
never
even
seen
you
yet
she
exclaimed
with
something
like
a
smile
i
only
know
you
as
two
eyes
over
a
tangle
of
hair
that
i
do
believe
you
ever
either
brush
or
comb
do
you
know
sometimes
i
am
he
took
her
hand
and
drew
her
to
sit
beside
him
on
the
bench
under
a
tree
near
by
all
his
doubts
and
fears
and
suspicions
he
set
far
from
him
and
remembered
nothing
save
that
she
was
the
woman
for
whom
yearned
all
the
depths
of
his
soul
as
by
decree
and
she
too
for
man
to
her
strange
aloof
mysterious
but
dominating
all
her
life
as
though
by
primal
necessity
when
they
parted
it
was
with
an
agreement
to
meet
again
that
evening
and
in
the
twilight
they
spent
a
halcyon
hour
together
saying
little
feeling
much
it
was
only
when
at
last
she
had
left
him
that
he
remembered
all
that
had
passed
that
had
happened
that
he
knew
suspected
dreaded
all
that
he
planned
and
intended
and
would
be
soon
called
upon
to
put
into
action
she
made
me
mad
he
said
to
himself
and
for
a
long
time
he
sat
there
in
the
darkness
in
the
stillness
of
the
evening
motionless
as
the
tree
in
whose
shade
he
sat
plunged
in
the
most
profound
and
strange
reverie
from
which
presently
his
quick
ear
alert
and
keen
even
when
his
mind
was
deep
in
thought
caught
the
light
and
careful
sound
of
an
approaching
footstep
in
a
moment
he
was
up
and
gliding
through
the
darkness
to
meet
who
was
coming
and
almost
at
once
a
voice
hailed
him
cautiously
there
you
are
dunn
deede
dawson
said
i
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
tomorrow
or
next
day
we
shall
be
able
to
strike
everything
is
ready
at
last
and
i
tell
you
now
exactly
what
we
are
going
to
that
good
news
said
dunn
softly
come
this
way
deede
dawson
said
and
led
dunn
through
the
darkness
to
the
gate
that
admitted
to
the
bittermeads
grounds
from
the
high
road
here
he
paused
and
stood
for
a
long
time
in
silence
leaning
on
the
gate
and
looking
out
across
the
road
to
the
common
beyond
close
beside
him
stood
dunn
controlling
his
impatience
as
best
he
could
and
wondering
if
at
last
the
secret
springs
of
all
these
happenings
was
to
be
laid
bare
to
him
but
deede
dawson
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
begin
for
a
long
time
he
remained
in
the
same
attitude
silent
and
sombre
in
the
darkness
and
when
at
last
he
spoke
it
was
to
utter
a
remark
that
quite
took
dunn
by
surprise
what
a
lovely
night
he
said
in
low
and
pensive
tones
very
unlike
those
he
generally
used
i
remember
when
i
was
a
boy
that
a
long
time
dunn
was
too
surprised
by
this
sudden
and
very
unexpected
lapse
into
sentiment
to
answer
deede
dawson
went
on
as
if
thinking
to
himself
a
long
time
i
done
a
lot
seen
a
lot
since
then
too
much
perhaps
i
remember
mother
told
me
once
poor
soul
i
believe
she
used
to
be
rather
proud
of
me
your
mother
dunn
said
wondering
greatly
to
think
this
man
should
still
have
such
memories
but
deede
dawson
seemed
either
to
resent
his
tone
or
else
to
be
angry
with
himself
for
giving
way
to
such
weakness
in
a
voice
more
like
his
usual
one
he
said
harshly
and
sneeringly
oh
yes
i
had
a
mother
once
just
like
everybody
else
why
not
most
people
have
their
mothers
though
it
not
an
arrangement
i
should
care
to
defend
now
then
ella
was
with
you
tonight
you
and
she
were
alone
together
a
long
well
growled
dunn
what
of
it
fine
girl
is
she
asked
deede
dawson
and
laughed
dunn
did
not
speak
it
filled
him
with
such
loathing
to
hear
this
man
so
much
as
utter
ella
name
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
his
hands
motionless
by
his
side
and
not
make
use
of
them
about
the
throat
she
been
useful
very
useful
deede
dawson
went
on
meditatively
her
mother
had
some
money
when
i
married
her
i
do
mind
telling
you
it
all
spent
now
but
ella
a
little
fortune
in
i
did
know
we
came
to
talk
about
her
said
dunn
slowly
i
thought
you
had
something
else
to
say
to
so
i
have
deede
dawson
answered
that
why
i
brought
you
here
we
are
safe
from
eavesdroppers
here
in
a
house
you
can
never
tell
who
is
behind
a
curtain
or
a
door
but
then
ella
is
a
part
of
my
plans
a
very
important
part
do
you
remember
i
told
you
i
might
want
you
to
take
a
second
away
from
here
in
the
car
one
night
yes
i
remember
said
dunn
slowly
i
remember
what
would
be
in
it
the
same
sort
of
thing
that
was
in
that
other
yes
answered
deede
dawson
much
the
i
shall
want
to
see
for
myself
said
dunn
i
a
trustful
sort
of
person
but
i
do
go
driving
about
the
country
with
late
at
night
unless
i
seen
for
myself
what
chapter
xxii
plots
and
plays
very
wise
of
you
yawned
deede
dawson
that
just
what
ella
said
what
that
for
instinctively
dunn
had
raised
his
hand
but
he
lowered
it
again
at
once
oh
cut
the
cackle
he
said
impatiently
tell
me
what
you
want
me
to
do
and
make
it
plain
very
plain
for
i
can
tell
you
there
a
good
deal
about
all
this
i
do
understand
and
i
not
inclined
to
trust
you
far
for
one
thing
what
are
you
after
yourself
where
do
you
come
in
what
are
you
going
to
get
and
there
another
thing
i
want
to
say
if
you
are
thinking
of
playing
any
tricks
on
me
do
do
it
unless
you
are
ready
to
take
big
risks
there
only
one
man
alive
who
ever
made
a
fool
of
me
and
his
name
is
rupert
dunsmore
and
i
do
think
today
what
insurance
companies
call
a
good
risk
not
by
any
manner
of
he
paused
to
laugh
harshly
let
get
to
business
he
said
look
here
how
do
i
know
you
mean
all
you
say
about
rupert
dunsmore
what
he
to
you
nothing
answered
deede
dawson
promptly
nothing
but
there
some
one
i
acting
for
to
whom
he
is
a
good
who
is
that
dunn
asked
sharply
do
you
think
i
going
to
tell
you
retorted
the
other
and
laughed
in
his
cold
mirthless
manner
perhaps
you
are
the
only
one
who
owes
him
a
that
likely
enough
but
i
want
to
know
where
i
standing
said
dunn
is
this
unknown
person
you
say
you
are
acting
for
anxious
to
bring
about
rupert
dunsmore
death
i
not
answering
any
questions
so
you
need
ask
them
replied
deede
dawson
but
i
will
tell
you
that
there
something
big
going
on
or
i
be
in
it
i
do
use
my
brains
on
small
things
you
know
if
it
comes
off
all
right
i
he
paused
and
for
once
a
thrill
of
genuine
emotion
sounded
in
his
voice
thousands
he
said
abruptly
yes
and
more
more
but
there
an
obstacle
rupert
dunsmore
it
your
place
to
remove
him
that
suit
you
and
it
mean
good
pay
as
much
as
you
like
to
ask
for
in
reason
and
ella
if
you
want
her
the
girl
be
any
use
to
me
when
this
is
over
and
you
can
have
her
if
you
like
i
do
think
she
object
from
what
i
can
see
not
that
it
would
matter
if
she
did
so
there
you
are
put
rupert
dunsmore
out
of
the
way
and
it
be
the
best
day
work
you
ever
done
and
you
shall
have
ella
into
the
bargain
if
you
claim
her
he
began
to
laugh
again
and
dunn
laughed
too
for
while
he
was
not
sure
what
it
was
that
amused
deede
dawson
there
were
certain
aspects
of
all
this
that
bore
for
him
a
very
curious
and
ironic
humour
all
right
he
said
you
bring
me
face
to
face
with
rupert
dunsmore
and
you
wo
have
to
grumble
about
the
result
for
i
swear
only
one
of
us
will
go
away
alive
but
how
are
you
going
to
do
it
i
my
plan
and
it
simple
enough
answered
deede
dawson
though
i
can
tell
you
it
took
some
working
out
but
the
simplest
problem
is
always
the
best
whether
in
life
or
in
again
he
indulged
in
a
low
and
guarded
outburst
of
his
thin
mirthless
laughter
before
he
continued
i
suppose
you
know
rupert
dunsmore
is
one
of
those
restless
people
who
are
never
content
except
when
wandering
about
in
some
out
of
the
way
place
or
another
as
often
as
not
no
one
having
the
least
idea
of
his
whereabouts
then
he
turns
up
unexpectedly
only
to
disappear
again
when
the
whim
takes
him
lately
he
has
been
away
on
one
of
these
trips
but
i
happen
to
know
he
is
coming
back
almost
at
once
what
the
matter
i
was
only
wondering
how
you
knew
that
answered
dunn
who
had
given
a
sudden
start
oh
i
know
never
mind
how
deede
dawson
said
i
know
that
tomorrow
afternoon
at
four
he
will
be
waiting
by
the
side
of
brook
bourne
spring
in
ottom
wood
near
general
dunsmore
place
which
is
as
out
of
the
way
and
quiet
and
lonely
a
spot
as
you
could
wish
and
you
have
information
that
he
will
be
there
dunn
said
incredulously
how
can
you
possibly
be
sure
of
that
never
mind
how
answered
deede
dawson
i
am
sure
that
enough
my
information
is
oh
it
is
is
it
dunn
muttered
you
are
a
wonderful
man
dawson
you
know
everything
or
nearly
everything
you
are
sure
of
everything
or
nearly
everything
but
suppose
he
changes
his
mind
at
the
last
moment
and
does
come
after
all
he
wo
answered
deede
dawson
you
be
there
and
you
find
him
there
all
well
perhaps
said
dunn
slowly
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
you
are
so
sure
there
a
good
deal
hangs
on
your
being
right
you
i
only
wish
i
was
as
certain
of
everything
else
deede
dawson
said
oh
all
right
exclaimed
dunn
i
suppose
you
know
and
you
may
be
i
am
deede
dawson
assured
him
listen
carefully
now
there
be
any
blunders
you
are
to
make
an
early
start
tomorrow
i
do
want
you
to
take
the
car
for
fear
of
its
being
seen
and
identified
you
must
take
the
train
to
london
and
then
another
train
back
immediately
to
delsby
from
delsby
you
have
an
walk
through
lonely
country
where
you
are
likely
to
meet
any
one
and
must
try
not
to
the
less
you
are
seen
the
better
you
know
that
for
yourself
and
for
your
own
sake
you
be
careful
you
have
no
time
to
spare
but
you
will
be
able
to
get
to
the
place
i
told
you
of
by
four
all
right
no
earlier
no
later
you
must
arrange
to
be
there
at
four
exactly
you
may
spoil
all
if
you
are
too
early
almost
as
soon
as
you
get
there
rupert
dunsmore
will
arrive
you
must
do
the
rest
for
yourself
and
then
you
must
strike
straight
across
country
for
here
you
can
look
up
your
routes
on
the
map
there
will
be
less
risk
of
attracting
attention
if
you
come
and
go
by
different
ways
you
ought
to
be
here
again
some
time
in
the
small
hours
i
let
you
in
and
you
have
cleared
your
own
score
with
rupert
dunsmore
and
earned
more
money
than
you
ever
have
had
in
all
your
life
before
now
can
i
depend
on
you
yes
yes
answered
dunn
over
whom
there
had
come
a
new
and
strange
sense
of
unreality
as
he
stood
and
listened
to
murder
being
thus
calmly
coolly
planned
as
though
it
were
some
afternoon
pleasure
trip
that
was
being
arranged
so
that
he
hardly
knew
whether
he
did
in
fact
hear
this
smooth
low
unceasing
voice
that
from
the
darkness
at
his
side
laid
down
such
a
bloody
road
for
his
feet
to
travel
oh
yes
you
can
depend
on
me
he
said
but
can
i
depend
on
you
when
you
say
rupert
dunsmore
will
be
there
at
that
time
and
that
place
it
was
a
moment
or
two
before
deede
dawson
answered
and
then
his
voice
was
very
low
and
soft
and
confident
as
he
said
yes
you
can
absolutely
you
see
i
know
his
oh
do
you
dunn
said
as
though
satisfied
oh
well
then
it
no
wonder
you
so
no
wonder
at
all
agreed
deede
dawson
there
just
one
other
thing
i
can
tell
you
some
one
else
will
be
there
too
at
brook
bourne
spring
in
ottam
who
that
asked
dunn
sharply
the
man
said
deede
dawson
who
is
behind
all
this
the
man
you
and
i
are
working
for
the
man
who
going
to
pay
us
even
better
than
he
he
he
will
be
there
repeated
dunn
drawing
a
deep
breath
yes
but
you
wo
see
him
and
it
would
help
you
if
you
did
deede
dawson
told
him
most
likely
he
be
disguised
a
mask
perhaps
i
do
know
anyhow
he
be
there
watching
i
not
suggesting
you
would
do
such
a
thing
as
never
go
near
the
place
loaf
around
a
bit
then
come
back
and
report
rupert
dunsmore
out
of
the
way
for
good
draw
your
pay
and
vanish
and
leave
us
to
find
out
he
was
as
lively
and
troublesome
as
ever
i
do
think
you
would
do
that
because
you
sounded
as
if
you
meant
what
you
said
when
you
told
me
he
was
your
worst
enemy
but
it
just
as
well
to
be
sure
and
so
we
mean
to
have
a
witness
and
as
it
what
you
might
call
a
delicate
matter
that
witness
will
most
likely
be
our
employer
himself
so
you
had
better
do
the
job
thoroughly
if
you
want
your
i
see
you
take
your
precautions
remarked
dunn
well
that
all
right
i
do
you
understand
exactly
what
you
got
to
do
deede
dawson
asked
dunn
nodded
what
about
allen
he
asked
does
he
take
any
part
in
this
show
he
and
i
are
planning
a
little
visit
to
wreste
abbey
rather
early
the
same
night
during
the
most
likely
answered
deede
dawson
carelessly
we
can
get
in
at
one
of
the
long
gallery
windows
quite
easily
allen
says
he
kept
his
eyes
open
that
day
you
all
went
there
it
may
be
helpful
to
give
the
police
two
problems
to
work
on
at
once
and
besides
big
as
this
thing
is
there
a
shortage
of
ready
money
at
present
but
our
little
affair
at
wreste
abbey
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
you
mind
what
you
got
to
do
and
do
trouble
about
anything
else
see
i
see
answered
dunn
slowly
and
if
you
can
arrange
for
rupert
dunsmore
to
be
there
at
that
time
all
right
i
answer
for
the
you
need
be
uneasy
about
that
deede
dawson
said
and
laughed
you
see
i
know
his
plans
he
repeated
and
laughed
again
and
still
laughing
that
chill
mirthless
way
of
his
he
turned
and
walked
back
towards
the
house
dunn
watched
him
go
through
the
darkness
and
to
himself
he
muttered
yes
but
i
wonder
if
you
chapter
xxiii
the
hour
was
late
by
now
but
dunn
felt
no
inclination
for
sleep
and
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
return
indoors
as
yet
since
deede
dawson
who
always
locked
up
the
house
himself
never
did
so
till
past
midnight
till
the
small
hours
very
often
he
was
accustomed
to
sit
up
absorbed
in
those
chess
problems
the
composing
and
solving
of
which
were
his
great
passion
so
that
indeed
it
is
probable
that
under
other
circumstances
he
might
have
passed
a
perfectly
harmless
and
peaceful
existence
known
to
wide
circles
as
an
extraordinarily
clever
problemist
and
utterly
unknown
elsewhere
but
the
fate
that
is
after
all
but
man
own
character
writ
large
had
decreed
otherwise
and
the
little
fat
smiling
man
bending
over
his
travelling
chess
board
on
which
he
moved
delicately
to
and
fro
the
tiny
red
and
white
men
of
carved
ivory
now
and
again
removing
a
piece
and
laying
it
aside
had
done
as
much
with
as
little
concern
to
his
fellow
creatures
from
the
very
beginning
of
his
terrible
career
outside
leaning
on
the
gate
where
deede
dawson
had
left
him
dunn
was
deep
in
thought
that
was
not
always
very
comforting
for
there
was
very
much
in
all
this
laid
out
for
him
to
accomplish
that
he
did
not
understand
and
that
disturbed
him
a
good
deal
a
careful
cautious
hist
broke
in
upon
his
thoughts
and
in
an
instant
he
stiffened
to
close
attention
every
nerve
on
the
alert
the
sound
was
repeated
a
faint
and
wary
footstep
sounded
and
in
the
darkness
a
form
appeared
and
stole
slowly
nearer
dunn
poised
for
a
moment
ready
for
attack
or
retreat
and
then
all
at
once
his
tense
attitude
relaxed
you
walter
he
exclaimed
that
good
but
how
did
you
get
here
and
how
did
you
know
where
i
was
the
drew
a
little
nearer
and
showed
the
tall
thin
form
of
walter
dunsmore
to
whom
dunn
had
spoken
at
wreste
abbey
i
had
to
come
he
murmured
i
could
rest
without
seeing
you
you
upset
me
the
other
day
saying
what
you
did
is
it
very
dangerous
your
being
here
suppose
deede
dawson
oh
if
he
suspected
there
would
soon
be
an
end
of
me
answered
dunn
grimly
but
i
think
i
going
to
win
at
least
i
did
till
what
happened
the
other
asked
sharply
and
anxiously
he
has
been
telling
me
his
plans
answered
dunn
he
has
told
me
everything
he
has
put
himself
entirely
in
my
power
he
has
done
what
i
have
been
waiting
and
hoping
for
ever
since
i
came
here
he
has
given
me
his
full
confidence
at
last
and
i
never
felt
more
uneasy
or
less
certain
of
success
than
i
do
at
this
he
has
told
you
everything
walter
dunsmore
asked
everything
except
who
is
behind
it
all
answered
dunn
i
asked
him
who
he
was
acting
for
and
he
refused
to
say
but
we
shall
know
that
tomorrow
for
he
told
me
something
almost
as
good
he
told
me
where
this
employer
would
be
at
four
tomorrow
afternoon
so
then
we
shall
have
him
unless
deede
dawson
was
of
course
it
all
depends
on
finding
that
out
remarked
walter
thoughtfully
finding
out
his
yes
that
the
key
move
to
the
problem
dunn
said
and
tomorrow
we
shall
know
it
if
deede
dawson
was
speaking
the
truth
just
i
should
think
he
was
said
walter
slowly
i
should
think
it
is
certain
he
was
you
may
depend
on
that
i
i
think
so
too
agreed
dunn
but
how
did
you
find
out
where
i
was
you
know
that
day
you
came
to
wreste
abbey
there
was
some
fellow
you
had
with
you
who
told
the
landlord
of
the
chobham
arms
so
i
easily
found
out
from
him
answered
walter
anyhow
i
glad
you
here
dunn
said
i
was
wondering
how
to
get
in
touch
with
you
well
this
is
deede
dawson
plan
in
brief
tomorrow
at
four
in
the
afternoon
rupert
dunsmore
is
to
be
killed
and
undertaken
to
do
the
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
walter
starting
i
promised
that
if
deede
dawson
will
bring
me
face
to
face
with
rupert
dunsmore
i
murder
him
answered
dunn
laughing
softly
a
fairly
safe
offer
on
your
part
is
it
observed
walter
at
least
unless
there
any
saving
clause
about
oh
none
answered
dunn
i
told
deede
dawson
rupert
dunsmore
was
my
worst
enemy
and
that
true
enough
for
i
think
every
man
worst
enemy
is
i
wish
i
had
none
worse
muttered
walter
i
think
you
have
old
chap
dunn
said
smilingly
but
come
across
the
road
it
be
safer
on
the
common
deede
dawson
is
so
cunning
one
is
never
safe
from
him
one
can
never
be
sure
he
is
creeping
up
well
i
daresay
it
wise
to
take
every
precaution
observed
walter
but
i
ca
imagine
either
him
or
any
one
else
getting
near
you
without
your
robert
dunn
or
rather
rupert
dunsmore
as
was
his
name
by
right
of
birth
laughed
again
to
himself
very
softly
in
the
darkness
perhaps
not
he
said
but
i
take
no
chances
i
can
avoid
with
deede
dawson
come
they
crossed
the
road
together
and
sat
down
on
the
common
at
an
open
spot
where
none
could
well
approach
them
unheard
or
unseen
dunn
laid
his
hand
affectionately
on
walter
shoulder
as
they
settled
themselves
old
chap
he
said
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
here
you
run
some
risk
it
none
too
safe
near
bittermeads
but
i
glad
to
see
you
walter
it
a
tremendous
relief
after
all
this
strain
of
doubt
and
watching
and
suspicion
to
be
with
some
one
i
know
some
one
i
can
trust
some
one
like
you
in
the
darkness
walter
put
out
his
hand
and
took
dunn
and
held
it
for
a
moment
i
have
been
anxious
about
you
he
said
dunn
returned
the
pressure
warmly
i
know
he
said
jove
old
chap
it
good
to
see
you
again
you
do
know
what
it
like
after
all
this
long
time
feeling
that
every
step
was
a
step
in
the
dark
to
be
at
last
with
a
real
friend
i
think
i
can
guess
walter
said
softly
dunn
shook
his
head
no
one
could
he
said
i
tell
you
i
doubted
distrusted
suspected
till
i
was
sure
of
my
own
shadow
well
that
all
over
now
tomorrow
we
can
tell
me
what
i
to
do
walter
dunsmore
said
there
a
whole
lot
i
do
understand
yet
dunn
continued
slowly
i
suppose
it
was
that
that
was
making
me
feel
so
jolly
down
before
you
came
i
do
feel
sure
somehow
not
sure
deede
dawson
is
such
a
cunning
brute
he
seems
to
have
laid
his
whole
hand
bare
and
yet
there
may
be
cards
up
his
sleeve
still
besides
his
plan
he
told
me
about
seems
so
bald
and
i
do
understand
why
he
should
think
he
is
so
sure
of
what
i
i
mean
of
what
rupert
it
a
bit
confusing
to
have
a
double
identity
is
going
to
do
he
says
he
is
sure
rupert
dunsmore
is
to
be
at
the
brook
bourne
spring
tomorrow
at
four
he
says
his
information
is
certain
and
that
he
has
full
knowledge
of
what
rupert
dunsmore
is
going
to
do
which
is
more
than
i
have
but
what
can
it
be
that
making
him
so
sure
that
probably
simple
enough
said
walter
you
said
you
suspected
there
was
a
leakage
from
burns
swift
office
and
you
told
burns
to
make
misleading
statements
about
your
movements
occasionally
when
he
was
dictating
his
letters
well
i
expect
this
is
that
may
be
only
deede
dawson
seems
so
very
sure
answered
dunn
but
what
specially
important
is
his
saying
that
his
employer
whoever
it
is
who
is
behind
all
this
will
be
there
a
meeting
is
that
it
exclaimed
walter
no
that
not
the
idea
answered
dunn
you
see
the
idea
is
that
rupert
dunsmore
will
be
there
at
four
and
that
i
to
be
there
in
ambush
to
murder
myself
whoever
is
behind
all
this
will
be
there
too
to
see
i
carry
out
my
work
properly
and
that
gives
us
our
oh
that
good
exclaimed
walter
we
shall
have
him
for
that
what
i
want
you
to
see
to
said
dunn
i
want
you
to
have
men
you
can
trust
well
hidden
all
round
ready
to
collar
him
and
i
want
you
to
have
all
the
roads
leading
to
ottam
wood
well
watched
and
every
one
going
along
them
noted
you
understand
that
quite
easy
declared
walter
i
can
promise
not
a
soul
will
get
into
ottam
wood
without
being
seen
and
i
make
very
sure
indeed
of
getting
hold
of
any
one
hiding
anywhere
near
brook
bourne
spring
and
once
we
done
that
once
we
know
who
it
is
yes
agreed
dunn
we
shall
be
all
right
then
that
is
the
one
thing
necessary
to
know
the
key
move
to
the
problem
the
identity
of
who
it
is
pulling
the
strings
he
must
be
a
clever
beggar
anyhow
i
mean
to
see
him
hang
for
it
i
daresay
he
clever
agreed
walter
he
is
playing
for
big
stakes
anyhow
we
have
him
tomorrow
all
right
that
seems
certain
at
at
last
agreed
dunn
with
a
sigh
ugh
it
all
been
such
a
nightmare
it
been
pretty
awful
knowing
there
was
some
one
not
able
to
guess
who
ever
since
you
discovered
that
first
attempt
ever
since
we
became
certain
there
was
a
plot
going
on
to
clear
out
every
one
in
succession
to
the
chobham
estates
and
that
was
jolly
plain
though
the
fools
of
police
did
babble
about
no
evidence
as
if
pistol
bullets
come
from
nowhere
and
poisoned
cups
of
tea
ah
i
was
to
blame
there
that
was
my
fault
said
walter
you
see
we
had
no
proof
about
the
shooting
and
when
i
had
spilt
that
tea
no
proof
of
poison
either
i
shall
always
regret
a
bit
of
bad
luck
dunn
agreed
but
accidents
will
happen
anyhow
it
was
clear
enough
some
one
was
trying
to
make
a
jolly
clear
sweep
it
may
be
a
madman
it
may
be
some
one
with
a
grudge
against
us
it
may
be
as
poor
charley
thought
some
one
in
the
line
of
succession
who
is
just
clearing
the
way
to
inherit
the
title
and
estates
himself
i
wish
i
knew
what
made
charley
suspicious
of
deede
dawson
in
the
first
you
do
know
that
walter
asked
no
he
never
told
me
answered
dunn
poor
charley
it
cost
him
his
life
that
another
thing
we
must
find
out
where
they
hidden
his
he
was
sure
from
the
first
remarked
walter
that
it
was
a
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
some
one
in
the
line
of
succession
yes
agreed
dunn
it
likely
enough
too
you
see
ever
since
that
big
family
row
and
dispersion
eighty
years
ago
a
whole
branch
of
the
family
has
been
entirely
lost
sight
of
there
may
be
half
a
dozen
possible
heirs
we
know
nothing
about
like
poor
john
clive
i
daresay
if
we
had
known
of
his
existence
we
should
have
begun
by
suspecting
there
one
thing
pretty
sure
remarked
walter
if
these
pleasant
little
arrangements
did
succeed
it
would
be
a
fairly
safe
guess
that
the
inheritor
of
the
title
and
estates
was
the
guilty
person
it
might
be
brought
home
to
him
perhaps
agreed
dunn
dryly
but
just
a
trifle
too
late
to
interest
me
for
one
and
i
do
mean
to
let
the
dad
or
uncle
be
sacrificed
if
i
can
help
it
i
failed
with
clive
poor
fellow
but
i
do
mean
to
again
and
i
do
see
how
we
can
deede
dawson
has
exposed
his
hand
now
we
can
play
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
walter
asked
are
you
going
to
follow
out
his
instructions
to
the
letter
dunn
answered
we
are
dealing
with
very
wary
suspicious
people
and
the
least
thing
might
make
them
take
alarm
the
important
point
of
course
is
the
promise
that
deede
dawson
employer
will
be
at
brook
bourne
spring
tomorrow
afternoon
that
our
trump
card
everything
hangs
on
that
and
to
make
sure
there
no
hitch
i
shall
do
exactly
what
i
been
told
to
do
i
expect
i
shall
be
watched
i
shall
be
there
at
four
and
ten
minutes
after
i
hope
we
shall
have
laid
hands
on
whoever
it
walter
nodded
i
do
see
how
we
can
fail
he
said
chapter
xxiv
an
aphorism
no
dunn
agreed
after
a
long
pause
no
i
do
see
myself
how
failure
is
possible
i
do
see
what
there
is
to
go
wrong
all
the
same
i
sha
be
sorry
when
it
all
over
i
suppose
i
nervous
that
the
truth
of
it
but
deede
dawson
hardly
the
sort
of
man
i
should
have
expected
to
lay
all
his
cards
on
the
table
so
oh
i
think
that
natural
enough
answered
walter
quite
natural
he
thinks
you
are
in
with
him
and
he
tells
you
what
he
wants
you
to
do
but
i
do
quite
see
the
object
of
your
visit
to
the
abbey
the
other
day
you
gave
me
the
shock
of
my
life
i
think
i
had
the
least
idea
who
you
were
that
beard
makes
a
wonderful
dunn
laughed
quietly
it
a
good
disguise
he
admitted
i
did
quite
know
myself
first
time
i
looked
in
a
mirror
we
went
to
the
abbey
to
prepare
for
a
burglary
oh
is
that
on
the
cards
too
exclaimed
walter
i
did
expect
yes
answered
dunn
my
own
idea
is
that
deede
dawson
sees
an
opportunity
for
making
a
bit
on
his
own
after
all
of
us
are
disposed
of
and
his
friend
has
got
the
title
and
estates
he
wo
dare
to
prosecute
of
course
and
so
deede
dawson
thinks
it
a
good
opportunity
to
visit
the
abbey
and
pick
up
any
pictures
or
heirlooms
or
he
can
that
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
dispose
of
in
the
ordinary
way
but
that
he
expects
he
will
be
able
to
sell
back
at
a
good
price
to
the
new
owner
of
the
property
i
think
he
calculates
that
that
gentleman
will
be
ready
to
pay
as
much
as
he
is
asked
i
do
know
but
i
think
that
his
idea
from
something
he
said
the
other
day
about
the
uselessness
of
even
good
stuff
from
a
big
house
unless
you
knew
of
a
sure
market
or
could
sell
it
back
again
to
the
jolly
clever
idea
if
it
works
all
right
said
walter
slowly
i
can
see
deede
dawson
is
a
man
who
needs
watching
and
i
suppose
we
had
better
be
on
the
at
the
abbey
tomorrow
night
evening
corrected
dunn
it
planned
for
the
right
said
walter
we
shall
see
some
crowded
hours
tomorrow
i
expect
well
it
like
this
as
i
understand
it
we
had
better
be
sure
everything
is
quite
clear
their
idea
is
that
you
will
meet
and
murder
rupert
dunsmore
who
they
have
no
notion
is
really
your
own
self
at
brook
bourne
spring
at
four
tomorrow
afternoon
and
the
unknown
somebody
who
is
behind
all
this
business
will
be
in
hiding
there
to
make
sure
you
do
your
work
properly
our
idea
is
to
watch
all
the
roads
leading
to
ottam
wood
and
to
have
men
in
ambush
near
the
spring
to
seize
any
one
hiding
there
at
that
time
then
we
shall
know
who
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
these
plots
and
shall
be
able
to
smash
the
whole
conspiracy
in
addition
deede
dawson
and
this
other
man
you
speak
of
allen
are
going
to
break
into
the
abbey
tomorrow
evening
and
we
are
to
be
ready
for
them
and
catch
them
in
the
act
yes
said
dunn
that
the
idea
you
can
manage
all
right
oh
yes
answered
walter
it
all
simple
enough
you
planned
it
out
so
jolly
well
there
nothing
much
left
for
me
to
do
and
i
see
what
you
nervous
about
there
nothing
that
can
go
wrong
very
well
your
plans
are
perfect
i
it
easy
enough
to
make
plans
when
you
know
just
what
the
other
side
are
going
to
do
observed
dunn
there
one
point
more
miss
cayley
i
mentioned
her
in
one
of
the
notes
i
sent
you
through
yes
i
remember
deede
dawson
said
walter
i
suppose
she
is
in
it
she
is
not
she
knows
nothing
declared
dunn
vehemently
but
it
was
she
who
took
away
poor
charley
body
was
it
asked
walter
but
for
that
you
would
have
had
evidence
enough
to
act
on
at
once
would
you
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
doing
dunn
replied
and
now
she
is
in
danger
herself
i
am
convinced
deede
dawson
is
growing
afraid
of
her
he
dropped
hints
i
sure
he
is
planning
something
perhaps
he
means
to
murder
her
as
well
so
besides
these
other
arrangements
i
want
to
see
that
there
a
trustworthy
man
watching
here
i
do
anticipate
that
there
any
immediate
danger
it
almost
certain
that
if
he
means
anything
he
will
wait
till
he
sees
how
this
other
business
is
turning
out
but
i
want
some
one
trustworthy
to
be
at
hand
in
case
of
need
you
will
see
to
that
oh
yes
i
can
spare
simmonds
i
send
him
answered
walter
though
i
must
say
my
dear
chap
i
do
think
i
should
trouble
much
about
that
young
lady
but
it
can
be
easily
managed
in
fact
everything
you
want
me
to
do
is
easy
enough
i
only
wish
some
of
it
was
a
bit
difficult
or
you
a
good
chap
walter
said
dunn
putting
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
again
well
i
think
it
all
settled
now
i
tell
you
looking
forward
a
good
deal
to
four
tomorrow
afternoon
i
feel
as
if
i
would
give
all
i
possess
to
know
who
it
do
make
that
offer
walter
said
with
a
smile
or
the
fates
may
accept
i
feel
as
though
there
only
one
thing
in
the
world
i
want
one
half
so
much
dunn
said
as
to
know
who
this
devil
devil
repeated
walter
well
yes
devil
a
word
like
any
i
think
it
justified
in
this
case
said
dunn
sternly
poor
charley
wright
dead
one
thing
i
ca
understand
about
that
is
how
they
got
him
back
here
when
you
saw
him
in
london
when
you
did
but
they
a
cunning
lot
they
must
have
worked
it
somehow
then
clive
i
feel
to
blame
for
clive
death
as
if
i
ought
to
have
managed
better
and
saved
him
now
there
this
other
devilry
they
are
planning
i
tell
you
walter
i
feel
the
whole
world
will
be
a
sweeter
place
after
four
tomorrow
at
any
rate
said
walter
i
think
we
may
be
sure
of
one
thing
after
four
tomorrow
afternoon
you
will
know
all
he
paused
and
repeated
slightly
varying
the
phrase
yes
after
four
tomorrow
afternoon
you
will
know
everything
he
added
in
a
brisker
tone
there
nothing
else
to
arrange
no
said
dunn
i
do
think
so
and
i
had
better
go
now
or
deede
dawson
will
be
suspecting
something
he
want
to
know
what
i
been
stopping
out
so
late
for
old
chap
and
good
they
shook
hands
and
good
luck
rupert
old
man
walter
said
you
may
depend
on
me
you
know
yes
i
do
know
that
dunn
answered
they
shook
hands
again
and
dunn
said
you
hurt
your
hand
it
tied
up
is
it
anything
much
no
no
answered
walter
with
a
little
laugh
a
mere
scratch
i
scratched
it
on
a
bit
of
wood
a
lid
that
did
fit
well
and
good
luck
dunn
said
again
and
they
parted
walter
disappearing
into
the
darkness
and
dunn
returning
to
the
house
deede
dawson
heard
him
enter
and
he
came
to
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
he
had
been
sitting
oh
there
you
are
he
said
been
enjoying
the
night
air
or
what
you
been
a
long
i
been
thinking
dunn
muttered
in
the
heavy
sulky
manner
he
always
assumed
at
bittermeads
not
weakening
eh
asked
deede
dawson
no
answered
dunn
i
good
deede
dawson
exclaimed
there
a
lot
to
win
and
no
fear
of
failure
i
do
see
that
failure
possible
do
you
no
answered
dunn
i
suppose
the
mate
sure
this
time
deede
dawson
declared
it
our
turn
to
move
and
whatever
reply
the
other
side
makes
we
sure
of
our
mate
next
move
by
the
way
did
you
ever
solve
that
problem
i
showed
you
the
other
day
yes
i
think
so
answered
dunn
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
could
hit
on
the
right
move
but
i
managed
it
at
last
i
come
and
show
me
then
said
deede
dawson
bustling
back
into
his
room
and
beginning
to
set
up
the
pieces
on
his
travelling
this
was
the
position
was
it
now
what
your
move
dunn
showed
him
and
deede
dawson
burst
into
a
laugh
that
had
in
it
for
once
a
touch
of
honest
enjoyment
yes
that
would
do
it
but
for
one
thing
you
have
noticed
he
said
black
can
push
the
pawn
at
and
make
it
not
a
queen
but
a
knight
giving
check
to
your
king
and
no
mate
for
you
next
yes
that
so
agreed
dunn
i
had
thought
of
unexpected
eh
making
the
pawn
a
knight
smiled
deede
dawson
but
in
chess
and
in
life
it
the
unexpected
you
have
to
look
out
that
quite
an
aphorism
said
dunn
it
true
he
went
up
to
bed
but
did
not
sleep
well
and
when
at
last
he
fell
into
a
troubled
slumber
it
seemed
to
him
that
charley
wright
and
john
clive
were
there
one
on
each
side
of
him
and
that
they
had
come
not
because
they
sought
for
vengeance
but
because
they
wished
to
warn
him
of
a
doom
like
their
own
that
they
could
see
approaching
but
he
could
not
toward
morning
he
got
an
hour
sound
rest
and
he
was
down
stairs
in
good
time
he
did
not
see
ella
but
he
heard
her
moving
about
so
knew
that
she
was
safe
as
yet
and
deede
dawson
gave
him
some
elaborate
parting
instructions
a
little
money
and
a
loaded
revolver
i
do
know
that
i
want
that
said
dunn
my
hands
will
be
all
i
need
once
i
face
to
face
with
rupert
that
the
right
spirit
said
deede
dawson
approvingly
but
the
pistol
may
be
useful
too
you
need
use
it
if
you
can
manage
without
but
you
may
as
well
have
it
and
the
best
of
luck
take
care
of
yourself
and
do
lose
your
head
or
do
anything
oh
you
can
trust
me
said
dunn
i
think
i
can
smiled
deede
dawson
i
think
i
can
be
careful
avoid
noise
and
fuss
do
be
seen
any
more
than
you
can
help
and
if
you
shoot
aim
there
a
vade
mecum
for
the
intending
assassin
dunn
thought
grimly
to
himself
but
he
said
nothing
gave
the
other
a
sullen
nod
and
started
off
on
his
strange
and
weird
mission
of
murdering
himself
he
found
himself
wondering
if
any
one
else
had
ever
been
in
such
a
situation
he
did
not
suppose
so
chapter
xxv
the
unexpected
to
the
very
letter
dunn
followed
the
careful
and
precise
instructions
given
him
by
deede
dawson
for
he
did
not
wish
to
rouse
in
any
way
the
slightest
suspicion
or
run
the
least
risk
of
frightening
off
that
unknown
instigator
of
these
plots
who
was
it
had
been
promised
him
to
be
present
near
brook
bourne
spring
at
four
that
afternoon
even
the
thought
of
ella
was
perhaps
less
clear
and
vivid
to
his
mind
just
now
than
was
his
intense
and
passionate
desire
to
discover
the
identity
of
the
strange
and
sinister
personality
against
whom
he
had
matched
himself
very
likely
it
some
madman
he
thought
to
himself
how
in
the
name
of
common
sense
can
he
expect
to
inherit
the
title
and
estates
quietly
after
such
a
series
of
crimes
as
he
seems
to
contemplate
does
he
think
no
one
will
have
any
suspicion
of
him
when
he
comes
forward
even
if
he
is
successful
in
getting
rid
of
all
of
us
in
this
way
how
does
he
expect
to
be
able
to
reap
his
reward
of
course
he
may
think
that
there
will
be
no
direct
evidence
if
he
manages
cleverly
enough
and
that
mere
suspicion
he
will
be
able
to
disregard
and
live
down
in
time
but
surely
it
will
be
plain
enough
that
benefits
is
guilty
the
whole
thing
is
mad
fantastic
why
the
mere
fact
of
any
one
making
a
claim
to
the
title
and
estates
would
be
almost
enough
to
justify
a
jury
in
returning
a
verdict
of
but
though
his
thoughts
ran
in
this
wise
all
the
time
he
was
journeying
to
london
and
though
he
repeated
them
to
himself
over
and
over
again
none
the
less
there
remained
an
uneasy
consciousness
in
his
mind
that
perhaps
these
people
had
plans
more
subtle
than
he
knew
and
that
even
this
difficulty
of
making
their
claim
without
bringing
instant
suspicion
on
themselves
they
had
provided
for
it
was
late
in
the
year
now
but
the
day
was
warm
and
very
calm
and
fine
at
the
london
terminus
where
he
alighted
he
had
a
strong
feeling
that
he
was
watched
and
when
he
took
the
train
back
to
delsby
he
still
had
the
idea
that
he
was
being
kept
under
observation
he
felt
he
had
been
wise
in
deciding
to
carry
out
deede
instructions
so
closely
for
he
was
sure
that
if
he
had
failed
to
do
so
in
any
respect
alarm
would
have
been
taken
at
once
and
warning
telegrams
gone
flying
on
the
instant
to
all
concerned
then
that
trap
at
brook
bourne
spring
wherein
he
hoped
to
see
his
enemy
taken
would
remain
unapproached
and
all
his
work
and
risk
would
have
gone
for
nothing
when
he
alighted
at
his
destination
he
was
a
little
before
time
and
so
he
got
himself
something
to
eat
at
a
small
near
the
station
before
starting
on
his
walk
across
country
though
he
was
not
sure
he
did
not
think
any
one
was
observing
him
now
most
likely
his
movements
up
to
the
present
had
appeared
satisfactory
and
it
had
not
been
thought
necessary
to
watch
him
longer
but
he
was
careful
to
do
nothing
to
rouse
suspicion
if
he
were
still
being
spied
upon
and
after
he
had
eaten
and
had
a
smoke
he
started
off
on
his
long
tramp
even
yet
he
was
careful
and
so
long
as
he
was
near
the
village
he
made
a
show
of
avoiding
observation
as
much
as
possible
later
on
when
he
had
made
certain
he
was
not
being
followed
he
did
not
trouble
so
much
though
he
still
kept
it
in
mind
that
any
one
he
met
or
passed
might
well
be
in
fact
one
of
deede
dawson
agents
he
walked
on
sharply
through
the
crisp
autumn
air
and
in
other
circumstances
would
have
found
the
walk
agreeable
enough
it
was
a
little
curious
that
as
he
proceeded
on
his
way
his
chief
preoccupation
seemed
to
shift
from
his
immediate
errand
and
intense
eagerness
to
discover
the
identity
of
his
unknown
foe
with
whom
he
hoped
to
stand
face
to
face
so
soon
to
a
troubled
and
pressing
anxiety
about
ella
up
till
now
he
had
not
thought
it
likely
that
she
was
in
the
least
real
danger
he
knew
simmonds
the
man
walter
had
promised
to
put
on
watch
at
bittermeads
and
knew
him
to
be
capable
and
trustworthy
none
the
less
his
uneasiness
grew
and
strengthened
with
every
mile
he
traversed
till
presently
her
situation
seemed
to
him
the
one
weak
link
in
his
careful
plans
that
the
trap
the
unknown
had
so
carefully
laid
for
himself
to
be
taken
in
would
assuredly
and
securely
close
upon
him
dunn
felt
certain
enough
walter
would
see
to
that
sure
was
it
too
that
the
enterprise
deede
dawson
had
planned
for
himself
and
allen
at
the
abbey
must
result
in
their
discomfiture
and
capture
walter
would
see
to
that
also
but
concerning
ella
position
doubt
would
insist
on
intruding
till
at
last
he
decided
that
the
very
moment
the
brook
bourne
spring
business
was
satisfactorily
finished
with
he
would
hurry
at
his
best
speed
to
bittermeads
and
make
sure
of
her
safety
absorbed
in
these
uneasy
thoughts
he
had
insensibly
slackened
speed
and
looking
at
his
watch
he
saw
that
it
was
two
and
that
he
was
still
by
the
milestone
at
the
roadside
eight
miles
from
his
destination
he
wished
to
be
there
a
little
before
the
time
arranged
for
him
by
deede
dawson
and
he
increased
his
pace
till
he
came
to
a
spot
where
the
path
he
had
to
take
branched
off
from
the
road
he
had
been
following
at
this
spot
a
heavy
country
lad
was
sitting
on
a
gate
by
the
wayside
and
as
dunn
approached
he
clambered
heavily
down
and
slouched
forward
to
meet
him
be
you
called
robert
dunn
mister
he
asked
dunn
gave
him
a
quick
and
suspicious
look
much
startled
by
this
sudden
recognition
in
so
lonely
a
spot
yes
i
am
he
said
after
a
moment
hesitation
why
if
you
are
there
this
as
i
to
give
you
the
lad
answered
drawing
a
note
from
his
pocket
oh
who
gave
you
that
dunn
asked
fully
persuaded
the
note
contained
some
final
instructions
from
deede
dawson
and
wondering
if
this
lad
were
one
of
his
agents
in
disguise
or
merely
some
inhabitant
of
the
district
hired
for
the
one
purpose
of
delivering
the
letter
but
the
lad
drawled
reply
disconcerted
him
greatly
a
lady
he
said
a
real
lady
in
a
big
car
she
told
me
to
wait
here
and
give
you
this
all
alone
she
was
and
drove
just
like
a
he
handed
the
letter
over
as
he
spoke
and
dunn
saw
that
it
was
addressed
to
him
in
his
name
of
robert
dunn
in
ella
writing
he
blinked
at
it
in
very
great
surprise
for
there
was
nothing
he
expected
less
and
he
did
not
understand
how
she
knew
so
well
where
he
would
be
or
how
she
had
managed
to
get
away
from
bittermeads
uninterfered
with
by
deede
dawson
his
first
impulse
was
to
suspect
some
new
trap
some
new
and
cunning
trap
that
perhaps
the
unconscious
ella
was
being
used
to
bait
taking
the
letter
from
the
boy
he
said
how
did
you
know
it
was
for
me
lady
told
me
answered
the
boy
grinning
she
said
as
i
was
to
look
out
for
a
chap
answering
to
the
name
of
robert
dunn
with
his
face
so
covered
with
hair
you
could
see
nothing
of
it
no
you
can
see
a
sheep
back
for
wool
soon
as
i
set
eye
on
says
i
him
i
says
and
so
was
he
grinned
again
and
slouched
away
and
dunn
stood
still
holding
the
letter
in
his
hand
and
not
opening
it
at
first
it
was
almost
as
though
he
feared
to
do
so
and
when
at
last
he
tore
the
envelope
open
it
was
with
a
hand
that
trembled
a
little
in
spite
of
all
that
he
could
do
for
there
was
something
about
this
strange
communication
and
the
means
adopted
to
deliver
it
to
him
that
struck
him
as
ominous
in
the
extreme
some
sudden
crisis
must
have
arisen
he
thought
and
it
appeared
to
him
that
ella
knowledge
of
where
to
find
him
implied
a
knowledge
of
deede
dawson
plans
that
meant
she
was
either
his
willing
and
active
agent
and
accomplice
or
else
she
had
somehow
acquired
a
knowledge
of
her
stepfather
proceedings
that
must
make
her
position
a
thousand
times
more
critical
and
dangerous
than
before
he
flung
the
envelope
aside
and
began
to
read
the
contents
it
opened
abruptly
without
any
form
of
address
and
it
was
written
in
a
hand
that
showed
plain
signs
of
great
distress
and
agitation
you
are
in
great
danger
i
do
know
what
i
heard
them
talking
they
spoke
as
though
something
threatened
you
something
you
could
not
escape
be
careful
very
careful
you
asked
me
once
if
i
had
ever
heard
a
man
with
a
high
squeaky
voice
and
i
did
not
answer
it
was
to
a
man
with
a
voice
like
that
i
gave
the
i
took
away
from
here
the
night
you
came
do
you
remember
he
was
here
all
last
night
i
think
i
saw
him
go
very
early
he
is
walter
dunsmore
i
saw
him
that
day
at
wreste
abbey
and
i
knew
i
had
seen
him
before
this
morning
i
recognized
him
i
am
sure
because
he
hurt
his
hand
on
the
lid
and
i
saw
the
mark
there
still
he
and
my
stepfather
were
talking
all
night
i
think
i
could
hear
everything
there
is
a
general
dunsmore
something
is
to
happen
to
him
at
three
and
then
to
you
later
and
they
both
laughed
a
great
deal
because
they
think
you
will
be
blamed
for
whatever
happens
to
general
dunsmore
he
is
to
be
enticed
somewhere
to
meet
you
but
you
are
not
to
be
there
till
four
too
late
i
am
afraid
more
afraid
than
ever
i
have
been
what
shall
i
do
i
think
they
are
making
plans
to
do
something
awful
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
think
my
stepfather
suspects
i
know
something
he
keeps
looking
looking
smiling
all
the
time
please
come
back
and
take
mother
and
me
away
for
i
think
he
means
to
kill
us
there
was
no
signature
but
written
like
an
afterthought
across
one
corner
of
the
note
were
the
scribbled
words
you
told
me
something
once
i
do
know
if
you
meant
and
then
underneath
was
the
addition
he
never
stops
twice
over
dunn
read
this
strange
disturbing
message
and
then
a
third
time
and
he
made
a
little
gesture
of
annoyance
for
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
the
words
he
read
made
sense
or
else
it
was
that
his
brain
no
longer
worked
normally
and
could
not
interpret
them
oh
but
that
absurd
he
said
aloud
he
looked
all
around
him
surprised
to
see
that
the
face
of
the
had
not
changed
in
any
way
but
was
all
just
as
it
had
been
before
this
letter
had
been
put
into
his
hands
he
began
to
read
a
third
but
stopped
through
the
first
sentence
then
it
walter
all
the
time
he
muttered
walter
walter
chapter
xxvi
a
race
against
time
even
when
he
had
said
this
aloud
it
was
still
as
though
he
could
not
grasp
its
full
meaning
walter
he
repeated
vaguely
his
thoughts
that
had
seemed
as
frozen
by
the
sudden
shock
of
the
tremendous
revelation
so
unconsciously
made
to
him
by
ella
began
to
stir
and
move
again
and
almost
at
once
with
an
extraordinary
and
abnormal
rapidity
as
a
drowning
man
is
said
to
see
flash
before
his
eyes
the
whole
history
and
record
of
his
life
so
now
dunn
saw
the
whole
story
of
his
friendship
with
walter
pictured
before
him
for
when
he
was
very
small
walter
had
been
to
him
like
an
elder
brother
and
when
he
was
older
it
was
walter
who
had
taught
him
to
ride
and
to
shoot
to
hunt
and
to
fish
and
when
he
was
at
school
it
was
walter
to
whom
he
looked
up
as
the
dashing
young
man
of
the
world
who
knew
all
life
secrets
and
when
he
was
at
college
it
was
walter
who
had
helped
him
out
of
the
inevitable
foolish
scrapes
into
which
it
is
the
custom
of
the
undergraduate
to
fall
then
when
he
had
come
to
man
estate
walter
had
still
been
his
confidential
friend
and
adviser
in
walter
hand
he
had
been
accustomed
to
leave
everything
during
his
absences
on
his
hunting
and
exploring
trips
and
at
what
time
during
this
long
and
kindly
association
of
had
such
black
hate
and
poison
of
envy
bred
in
heart
walter
he
said
aloud
once
more
and
he
uttered
the
name
as
though
it
were
a
cry
of
anguish
yet
too
even
in
his
utter
bewilderment
and
surprise
it
seemed
strange
to
him
that
he
had
never
once
suspected
never
dreamed
never
once
had
the
shadow
of
a
suspicion
little
things
trifling
things
a
word
an
accent
a
phrase
that
had
passed
at
the
time
for
a
jest
a
thousand
such
memories
came
back
to
him
now
with
a
new
and
terrible
significance
for
after
all
walter
was
in
the
direct
line
only
just
a
few
lives
stood
between
him
and
a
great
inheritance
a
great
position
perhaps
long
brooding
on
what
might
so
easily
be
had
made
him
mad
dunn
remembered
now
too
that
it
was
walter
who
had
discovered
that
first
murderous
attempt
which
had
first
put
them
on
their
guard
but
perhaps
he
had
discovered
it
only
because
he
knew
of
it
and
when
it
failed
saw
his
safest
plan
was
to
be
foremost
in
tracking
it
out
and
it
was
walter
who
had
last
seen
poor
charley
wright
alone
and
far
from
bittermeads
but
perhaps
that
was
a
lie
to
confuse
the
search
for
the
missing
man
and
a
reason
why
that
search
had
failed
so
utterly
up
to
the
moment
of
dunn
own
grim
discovery
in
the
attic
with
yet
a
fresh
shock
so
that
he
reeled
as
he
stood
with
the
impact
of
the
thought
dunn
realized
that
all
this
implied
that
every
one
of
his
precautions
had
been
rendered
futile
that
of
all
his
elaborate
plans
not
one
would
take
effect
since
all
had
been
entrusted
to
the
care
of
the
very
man
against
whom
they
were
aimed
it
was
walter
for
whom
the
net
had
been
laid
in
ottam
wood
and
walter
to
whom
had
been
entrusted
the
task
of
drawing
that
net
tight
at
the
right
moment
it
was
walter
friends
and
agents
who
were
to
break
into
wreste
abbey
and
walter
to
whom
had
been
entrusted
the
task
of
defeating
and
capturing
them
it
was
walter
from
whom
ella
stood
in
most
danger
if
her
action
that
morning
had
been
observed
and
it
was
walter
to
whom
he
had
given
the
task
of
protecting
her
at
this
thought
he
turned
and
began
to
run
as
fast
as
he
could
in
the
direction
of
bittermeads
at
all
costs
she
must
be
saved
she
who
had
exposed
the
whole
awful
plot
for
a
hundred
yards
or
so
he
fled
swift
as
the
wind
till
on
a
sudden
he
stopped
dead
with
the
realization
of
the
fact
that
every
yard
he
took
that
way
took
him
further
and
further
from
ottam
wood
for
there
was
danger
there
too
grim
and
imminent
and
sentences
in
ella
hasty
letter
that
bore
now
to
his
new
knowledge
a
deep
significance
she
had
not
dreamed
of
as
when
a
flash
of
lightning
lights
all
the
landscape
up
and
shows
the
traveller
dreadful
dangers
that
beset
his
path
so
a
wave
of
intuition
told
dunn
clearly
the
whole
conspiracy
so
that
he
saw
it
all
and
saw
how
every
detail
was
to
be
fitted
in
together
his
father
general
dunsmore
was
to
be
murdered
first
at
the
brook
bourne
spring
to
which
he
was
being
lured
and
afterwards
when
dunn
arrived
he
was
to
be
murdered
too
and
on
him
dead
and
unable
to
defend
himself
the
blame
of
his
father
death
would
be
laid
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
manage
walter
would
arrange
it
all
as
neatly
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
arrange
the
dunsmore
business
affairs
placed
in
his
hands
for
settlement
a
forged
letter
or
two
dunn
own
revolver
used
to
shoot
the
old
man
with
and
then
placed
in
dunn
dead
hand
when
his
own
turn
had
come
convincing
detail
like
that
would
be
easy
to
arrange
why
the
very
fact
of
his
disguise
the
tangled
beard
that
he
had
grown
to
hide
his
features
with
would
appear
conclusive
any
coroner
jury
would
return
a
verdict
of
wilful
murder
against
his
memory
on
that
one
fact
alone
walter
would
see
to
that
all
right
a
little
false
evidence
apparently
reluctantly
given
would
be
added
and
all
would
be
kneaded
together
into
the
one
substance
till
the
whole
guilt
of
all
that
happened
would
appear
to
lie
solely
on
his
shoulders
as
for
motive
it
would
simply
be
put
forward
that
he
had
been
in
a
hurry
to
succeed
his
uncle
and
very
likely
some
tale
of
a
quarrel
with
his
father
or
something
of
that
sort
would
be
invented
and
would
go
uncontradicted
since
there
would
be
no
one
to
contradict
it
and
most
probably
what
was
contemplated
at
wreste
abbey
was
no
ordinary
burglary
but
the
assassination
of
old
lord
chobham
of
which
the
guilt
would
also
be
set
down
to
him
very
clearly
now
he
realized
that
this
tremendous
plot
was
aimed
not
only
at
life
but
at
honour
that
not
only
was
his
life
required
but
also
that
he
should
be
thought
a
murderer
with
the
realization
of
the
danger
that
threatened
at
wreste
abbey
he
turned
and
began
to
run
back
in
the
direction
where
it
lay
that
he
might
take
timely
warning
there
but
he
did
not
run
a
dozen
strides
when
he
remembered
ella
again
and
paused
surely
he
must
think
of
her
first
alone
and
unprotected
for
she
was
the
woman
he
loved
and
besides
she
had
summoned
him
to
her
help
and
then
she
was
a
woman
and
at
least
the
others
were
men
all
this
flood
of
thoughts
this
intuitive
grasping
of
a
situation
terrible
beyond
conception
almost
unparalleled
in
bloody
and
dreadful
horror
passed
through
his
mind
with
extreme
rapidity
once
more
he
turned
and
began
to
run
to
run
as
he
had
never
run
before
for
now
he
saw
that
all
depended
on
the
speed
with
which
he
could
cover
the
eight
miles
that
lay
between
him
and
ottam
wood
whether
he
could
still
save
his
father
or
not
the
district
was
lonely
in
the
extreme
there
was
no
human
habitation
near
no
place
where
he
could
obtain
any
help
or
any
swift
means
of
conveyance
his
one
hope
must
be
in
his
speed
his
feet
must
be
swift
to
save
not
only
his
own
life
and
his
father
but
his
honour
too
and
ella
and
his
old
uncle
as
well
and
all
all
hung
upon
the
speed
with
which
he
could
cover
the
eight
long
miles
that
lay
between
him
and
brook
bourne
spring
in
ottam
wood
even
as
he
ran
as
he
thought
of
ella
he
came
abruptly
to
a
pause
wrung
with
sudden
anguish
for
each
fleet
stride
he
was
making
towards
brook
bourne
spring
was
taking
him
further
and
further
away
from
bittermeads
just
as
before
each
step
to
bittermeads
had
been
taking
him
further
from
ottam
wood
he
began
to
run
again
even
faster
than
before
and
it
was
towards
ottam
wood
that
he
ran
each
step
taking
him
further
from
bittermeads
and
further
from
the
woman
he
loved
in
her
bitter
need
and
peril
who
looked
to
him
for
the
help
he
could
not
give
with
pain
and
anguish
he
ran
on
ran
as
men
have
seldom
run
as
seldom
so
much
was
hung
upon
their
running
on
and
on
he
sped
fleet
as
the
wind
fleet
as
the
light
breeze
that
blew
lightly
by
a
solitary
villager
trudging
on
some
errand
in
this
lonely
place
tells
to
this
day
the
tale
of
the
bearded
man
who
raced
so
madly
by
him
raced
on
and
down
the
long
straight
road
till
his
figure
dwindled
and
vanished
in
the
distance
a
shepherd
boy
went
home
with
a
tale
of
a
strange
thing
he
had
seen
of
a
man
running
so
fast
it
seemed
he
was
scarcely
in
sight
before
he
was
gone
again
and
except
for
those
two
and
one
other
none
saw
him
at
all
and
he
ran
his
race
alone
beneath
the
skies
across
the
bare
country
side
it
was
at
a
spot
where
the
path
ran
between
two
high
hedges
that
he
came
upon
a
little
herd
of
cows
a
lad
was
driving
home
it
seemed
impossible
to
pass
through
that
tangle
of
horns
and
tails
and
plunging
hoofs
and
so
indeed
it
was
but
dunn
took
another
way
and
with
one
leap
cleared
the
first
beast
clean
and
alighted
on
the
back
of
the
second
before
the
startled
beast
could
plunge
away
he
leaped
again
from
the
vantage
of
its
back
and
landed
on
the
open
ground
beyond
and
so
on
darting
full
speed
past
the
staring
driver
whose
tale
that
he
told
when
he
got
home
caused
him
to
go
branded
for
years
as
a
liar
on
and
on
dunn
fled
without
stay
or
pause
at
the
utmost
of
his
speed
every
second
of
time
every
yard
of
distance
for
he
knew
he
had
need
of
every
ounce
of
power
he
possessed
or
could
call
to
his
aid
since
he
knew
well
that
all
all
might
hang
upon
a
second
less
or
more
and
now
four
miles
lay
behind
him
and
four
in
front
still
on
he
raced
with
labouring
lungs
and
heart
near
to
bursting
onward
still
swift
swift
and
sure
and
now
there
were
six
miles
behind
and
only
two
in
front
and
he
was
beginning
to
come
to
a
part
of
the
country
that
he
knew
whether
he
was
soon
or
late
he
had
no
idea
or
how
long
it
was
that
he
had
raced
like
this
along
the
lonely
country
road
at
the
full
extremity
and
limit
of
his
strength
he
dared
not
take
time
to
glance
at
his
watch
for
he
knew
the
fraction
of
a
second
he
would
thus
lose
might
mean
the
difference
between
in
time
and
too
late
on
he
ran
still
and
presently
he
left
the
path
and
took
the
fields
but
he
had
forgotten
that
though
the
distance
might
be
shorter
the
going
would
be
harder
and
on
the
rough
grass
he
stumbled
and
across
the
bare
ground
damp
earth
clung
to
his
boots
and
hindered
him
as
though
each
foot
had
become
laden
with
lead
his
speed
was
slower
his
effort
greater
if
possible
and
when
he
came
to
a
hedge
he
made
no
effort
to
leap
but
crashed
through
it
as
best
he
could
and
broke
or
clambered
or
tumbled
a
path
for
himself
now
ottam
wood
was
very
near
and
reeling
and
staggering
like
a
man
wounded
to
the
death
but
driven
by
inexorable
fate
he
plunged
on
still
and
there
was
a
little
froth
gathering
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
from
one
of
his
nostrils
came
a
thin
trickle
of
blood
yet
still
he
held
on
though
in
truth
he
hardly
knew
any
longer
why
he
ran
or
what
his
need
for
haste
and
as
he
came
to
the
wood
round
a
spur
where
a
cluster
of
young
beeches
grew
he
saw
a
tall
upright
elderly
man
walking
there
and
of
a
neat
appearance
hallo
there
you
are
father
he
gasped
and
fell
down
prone
unconscious
chapter
xxvii
flight
and
pursuit
when
he
came
to
himself
he
was
lying
on
his
back
and
bending
over
him
was
his
father
familiar
face
wearing
an
expression
of
great
surprise
and
wonder
and
still
greater
annoyance
what
is
the
matter
general
dunsmore
asked
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
his
son
senses
were
returning
to
him
have
you
all
gone
mad
together
you
send
me
a
mysterious
note
to
meet
you
here
at
three
you
turn
up
racing
and
running
like
an
escaped
lunatic
and
with
a
disgusting
growth
of
hair
all
over
your
face
so
that
i
did
know
you
till
you
spoke
and
then
there
walter
dodging
about
in
the
wood
here
like
a
poacher
hiding
from
the
keepers
are
you
both
quite
mad
rupert
walter
rupert
repeated
lifting
himself
on
one
hand
walter
have
you
seen
him
over
there
said
the
general
nodding
towards
the
right
he
was
dodging
and
creeping
about
for
all
the
world
like
some
poaching
rascal
i
waved
but
he
did
see
me
and
when
i
tried
to
overtake
him
i
lost
sight
of
him
somehow
in
the
trees
and
found
i
had
come
right
out
of
my
way
for
brook
bourne
thank
god
for
that
said
rupert
fervently
as
a
picture
presented
itself
to
him
of
his
unsuspecting
father
trying
in
that
lonely
wood
to
find
and
overtake
the
man
whose
murderous
purpose
was
aimed
at
his
life
what
do
you
mean
snapped
the
general
and
why
have
you
made
such
a
spectacle
of
yourself
with
all
that
beard
why
i
did
know
you
till
you
spoke
there
walter
there
what
makes
him
look
like
that
for
walter
had
just
come
out
of
the
wood
about
fifty
yards
to
their
right
and
when
he
saw
them
talking
together
he
understood
at
once
that
in
some
way
or
another
all
his
plans
had
failed
he
was
looking
at
them
through
a
gap
in
some
undergrowth
that
hid
most
of
his
body
but
showed
his
head
and
shoulders
plainly
and
as
he
stood
there
watching
them
his
face
was
like
a
fiend
walter
the
general
shouted
and
to
his
son
rupert
he
said
the
walter
moved
forward
from
among
the
trees
he
had
a
gun
in
his
hand
and
he
flung
it
forward
as
though
preparing
to
fire
and
at
the
same
moment
rupert
dunsmore
drew
from
his
pocket
the
pistol
deede
dawson
had
given
him
and
fired
himself
but
at
the
very
moment
that
he
pulled
the
trigger
the
general
struck
up
his
arm
so
that
the
bullet
flew
high
and
harmless
through
the
tops
of
the
trees
walter
stepped
back
again
into
the
wood
and
rupert
said
you
do
know
what
you
have
done
you
are
mad
mad
the
general
gasped
his
face
was
very
pale
and
he
trembled
a
little
for
though
he
had
heard
many
bullets
whistle
by
his
ears
that
had
happened
in
action
against
an
enemy
and
was
altogether
different
from
this
he
put
out
his
hand
in
an
attempt
to
take
the
pistol
that
rupert
easily
evaded
give
it
to
me
he
said
i
saved
his
life
you
might
have
killed
yes
you
saved
him
father
rupert
muttered
thinking
to
himself
that
the
saving
of
walter
life
might
well
mean
the
loss
of
ella
since
very
likely
the
failure
of
their
plots
would
be
at
once
attributed
by
the
conspirators
to
her
father
i
never
wrote
that
letter
you
say
you
had
walter
forged
it
to
get
you
here
where
he
meant
to
kill
us
both
that
why
he
looked
like
that
that
why
he
had
his
general
dunsmore
only
stared
blankly
at
him
for
a
moment
kill
me
kill
you
what
for
he
gasped
so
that
he
might
become
lord
chobham
of
wreste
abbey
instead
of
lord
chobham
poor
relation
answered
rupert
the
poison
attempt
on
uncle
which
walter
discovered
was
first
of
all
his
own
doing
it
was
through
him
charley
wright
lost
his
life
he
has
committed
at
least
one
other
murder
today
he
meant
to
kill
both
of
us
then
he
would
have
been
heir
to
the
title
and
estates
and
when
uncle
died
he
would
have
been
lord
nonsense
absurd
impossible
you
mad
quite
mad
the
general
stammered
why
he
would
have
been
hanged
at
not
if
he
could
have
fixed
the
blame
elsewhere
rupert
answered
that
was
to
have
been
my
part
it
was
carefully
arranged
to
make
it
seem
i
was
responsible
for
it
all
i
have
time
to
explain
now
i
do
think
he
is
coming
back
i
expect
he
is
only
loaded
with
small
shot
and
he
does
dare
try
a
long
range
shot
or
come
near
now
he
knows
i
ready
for
but
it
it
impossible
walter
stammered
the
general
the
impossible
so
often
happens
answered
rupert
and
handed
his
pistol
to
him
you
must
trust
me
father
and
do
what
i
tell
you
take
this
pistol
in
case
you
are
attacked
on
the
way
home
you
may
be
but
i
do
think
it
likely
get
the
motor
out
and
go
straight
to
wreste
abbey
an
attempt
on
uncle
life
will
be
made
tonight
if
they
still
carry
out
their
plans
about
tonight
see
that
every
possible
precaution
is
taken
see
to
that
first
then
send
help
as
soon
as
you
can
to
bittermeads
a
house
on
the
outskirts
of
ramsdon
any
one
there
will
tell
you
where

to
do
general
dunsmore

to

he
still
hiding
in
the
wood
here
as
he
may
be
rupert
answered
i
should
like
a
little
chat
with
for
a
moment
he
nearly
lost
his
and
for
a
single
moment
there
showed
those
fiery
and
tempestuous
passions
he
was
keeping
now
in
such
stern
repression
yes
a
little
talk
with
him
just
us
two
he
said
and
if
he
cleared
out
or
i
ca
find
him

going
straight
on

one

danger

sooner
i
am

but
wait
a
moment
the
general
cried
are
you
armed
yes
with
my
hands
i
shall
want
no
more
when
walter
and
i
meet
again
rupert
answered
and
without
another
word
plunged
into
the
wood
at
the
spot
where
walter
had
vanished
at
first
the
track
of
walter
flying
footsteps
was
plain
enough
for
he
had
fled
full
speed
panic
having
overtaken
him
when
he
saw
rupert
and
his
father
together
and
understood
that
in
some
way
his
deep
conspiracy
had
failed
and
his
treachery
become
known
for
a
little
distance
therefore
he
had
crashed
through
bracken
and
undergrowth
heedless
of
all
but
the
one
need
that
was
upon
him
to
flee
away
and
escape
while
there
was
yet
time
but
after
a
while
his
first
panic
subsiding
he
had
gone
more
carefully
and
as
the
weather
had
been
very
dry
of
late
when
he
came
to
open
ground
his
footmarks
were
scarcely
visible
in
such
spots
rupert
could
make
but
slow
progress
and
he
was
handicapped
too
by
the
fact
that
all
the
time
he
had
to
be
on
his
guard
lest
from
some
unsuspected
quarter
his
enemy
should
come
upon
him
unawares
for
indeed
this
enterprise
he
had
undertaken
in
the
flood
tide
of
his
passion
and
fierce
anger
was
dangerous
enough
since
he
quite
weaponless
was
following
up
a
very
desperate
armed
man
who
would
know
that
for
him
there
could
be
henceforth
no
question
of
mercy
but
there
was
that
burning
in
rupert
heart
that
made
him
heedless
of
all
danger
and
indeed
he
who
for
mere
love
of
sport
and
adventure
had
followed
a
wounded
tiger
into
the
jungle
and
tracked
a
buffalo
through
thick
reeds
was
not
likely
to
draw
back
now
once
he
thought
he
had
succeeded
for
he
saw
a
bush
move
and
he
rushed
at
once
upon
it
but
when
he
reached
it
there
was
nothing
there
and
the
ground
about
was
hard
and
bare
showing
no
marks
to
prove
any
one
had
lately
been
near
and
once
he
saw
a
movement
in
the
midst
of
some
bracken
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
what
seemed
like
walter
coat
so
that
he
was
sure
he
had
him
at
last
and
he
shouted
and
ran
forward
but
again
no
one
was
there
though
the
bracken
was
all
trampled
and
beaten
down
the
tracks
walter
had
made
in
going
were
plain
too
but
rupert
lost
them
almost
at
once
and
could
not
find
them
again
and
when
he
came
a
little
later
to
the
further
edge
of
the
wood
he
decided
to
waste
no
more
time
but
to
make
his
way
direct
to
bittermeads
so
as
at
least
to
make
sure
of
ella
safety
he
told
himself
that
he
had
failed
badly
in
woodcraft
and
indeed
he
had
been
too
fierce
and
hot
in
his
pursuit
to
show
his
wonted
skill
the
plan
that
had
been
in
his
mind
from
the
moment
when
he
left
his
father
was
to
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
on
this
edge
of
the
wood
was
situated
a
farm
belonging
to
lord
chobham
where
horses
were
bred
and
where
he
was
well
known
some
of
these
horses
were
sure
to
be
out
in
the
fields
and
it
would
be
easy
for
him
wasting
no
time
in
explanation
to
catch
one
of
them
mount
and
ride
through
the
new
plantation
the
new
plantation
was
a
hundred
years
old
but
still
kept
that
name
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
beyond
swim
the
canal
in
the
valley
and
so
straight
to
ramsdon
riding
thus
direct
he
would
save
time
and
distance
and
arrive
more
quickly
than
by
going
the
necessary
distance
to
secure
a
which
would
have
also
to
take
a
much
more
circuitous
route
he
jumped
the
hedge
therefore
that
lay
at
the
wood
edge
and
slid
down
the
steep
bank
into
the
sunken
road
beyond
where
he
found
himself
standing
in
front
of
walter
who
held
in
his
hands
a
gun
levelled
straight
at
rupert
heart
i
could
have
shot
you
time
after
time
in
there
you
know
he
said
quietly
from
behind
that
bush
and
from
out
of
the
bracken
too
i
do
know
why
i
did
i
suppose
it
was
worth
while
now
i
shall
never
be
lord
he
flung
down
his
gun
as
he
spoke
and
sprang
on
a
bicycle
that
he
had
held
leaning
against
his
legs
quickly
he
sped
away
leaving
rupert
standing
staring
after
him
realizing
that
his
life
had
hung
upon
the
bending
of
walter
finger
and
that
walter
with
at
least
two
murders
to
his
account
or
little
more
to
hope
for
in
this
world
or
the
next
had
now
inexplicably
spared
him
for
whose
destruction
of
life
and
honour
alike
he
had
a
little
before
been
laying
such
elaborate
hellish
plans
with
a
gesture
of
his
hands
that
proved
he
failed
to
understand
rupert
ran
on
and
crossed
a
field
to
where
he
saw
some
horses
grazing
one
he
knew
immediately
for
one
of
his
father
mares
and
he
knew
her
also
for
an
animal
of
speed
and
endurance
the
mare
knew
him
too
and
suffered
him
to
mount
her
without
difficulty
and
without
a
soul
on
the
farm
being
aware
of
what
was
happening
and
without
having
to
waste
any
precious
time
on
explanations
or
declaring
his
identity
rupert
rode
away
sitting
the
mare
through
the
new
plantation
towards
bittermeads
where
he
hoped
arriving
unexpectedly
to
be
able
to
save
ella
before
the
danger
he
was
sure
threatened
her
came
to
a
head
of
one
thing
he
was
certain
deede
dawson
would
never
do
what
his
companion
in
villainy
had
just
done
he
would
spare
no
one
fierce
malignant
and
evil
to
the
last
his
one
thought
if
he
knew
they
had
and
vengeance
approached
would
be
to
do
what
harm
he
could
before
the
end
chapter
xxviii
back
at
bittermeads
when
riding
fast
rupert
dunsmore
came
in
sight
of
bittermeads
he
experienced
a
feeling
of
extreme
relief
though
what
he
had
feared
he
did
not
quite
know
for
he
did
not
see
that
any
alarm
could
have
reached
here
yet
or
any
hint
come
to
deede
dawson
of
the
failure
of
all
his
plotting
even
if
walter
had
had
the
idea
of
returning
to
give
his
accomplice
warning
he
could
not
have
come
by
the
road
on
his
bicycle
as
quickly
as
rupert
had
ridden
across
country
and
that
walter
would
spend
either
time
or
thought
on
deede
dawson
did
not
appear
in
any
way
probable
to
rupert
therefore
it
seemed
certain
that
deede
dawson
could
know
nothing
as
yet
but
all
the
same
it
was
an
immense
relief
to
see
the
house
again
and
to
know
that
in
a
few
moments
he
would
be
there
he
tied
up
the
mare
to
a
convenient
tree
and
with
eyes
that
were
quick
and
alert
and
every
nerve
and
muscle
ready
for
all
emergencies
he
drew
near
the
house
all
was
still
and
quiet
no
smoke
came
from
the
chimneys
there
was
no
sign
of
life
or
movement
anywhere
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
and
then
made
his
way
round
to
the
back
hoping
to
find
barker
there
and
perhaps
obtain
from
her
information
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
deede
dawson
and
of
ella
and
her
mother
for
it
seemed
to
him
it
would
be
his
best
plan
to
get
the
two
women
quietly
out
of
the
way
if
he
could
possibly
do
so
before
making
any
attempt
to
deal
with
deede
dawson
or
letting
him
know
of
his
return
for
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
back
again
so
soon
would
show
at
once
that
something
had
gone
seriously
wrong
and
once
deede
dawson
knew
that
he
would
be
rupert
well
realized
in
a
very
desperate
and
reckless
mood
and
ripe
for
committing
any
mischief
that
he
could
cautiously
rupert
opened
the
back
door
and
found
himself
in
the
passage
that
ran
between
the
kitchen
and
the
scullery
and
pantry
everything
seemed
very
quiet
and
still
and
there
was
no
sign
of
barker
nor
any
appearance
that
she
had
been
that
morning
busy
about
her
usual
tasks
the
kitchen
fire
was
not
lighted
a
pile
of
unwashed
crockery
stood
on
the
table
there
had
apparently
been
no
attempt
to
prepare
any
meals
frowning
uneasily
for
all
this
did
not
seem
to
him
of
good
omen
rupert
went
quickly
on
to
the
living
rooms
they
were
unoccupied
and
did
not
seem
to
have
been
much
used
that
day
and
in
the
small
deede
dawson
had
been
accustomed
to
consider
his
special
apartment
his
favourite
little
travelling
chessboard
stood
on
the
table
with
pieces
in
position
on
it
there
was
a
letter
too
he
had
begun
but
not
finished
to
the
editor
of
a
in
some
paper
apparently
to
the
effect
that
a
certain
problem
cooked
and
that
by
such
and
such
a
move
the
mate
for
the
first
player
that
appeared
certain
was
unexpectedly
and
instantly
transferred
in
this
dramatic
manner
into
a
mate
for
his
the
words
seemed
somehow
oddly
appropriate
to
rupert
and
he
smiled
grimly
as
he
read
them
and
then
all
at
once
his
expression
changed
and
his
whole
attitude
became
one
of
intense
watchfulness
and
readiness
for
his
quick
eye
had
noted
that
the
ink
on
the
nib
of
the
pen
that
this
letter
had
been
written
with
was
not
yet
dry
then
deede
dawson
must
have
been
here
a
moment
or
two
ago
and
must
have
gone
in
a
hurry
that
could
only
mean
he
was
aware
of
rupert
return
and
was
warned
and
suspicious
it
is
perhaps
characteristic
of
passionate
and
eager
temperament
that
only
now
did
it
occur
to
him
that
he
was
quite
unarmed
and
that
without
a
weapon
of
any
kind
he
was
matching
himself
against
as
reckless
and
as
formidable
a
criminal
as
had
ever
lived
for
want
of
anything
better
he
picked
up
the
heavy
glass
inkpot
standing
on
the
table
emptied
the
contents
in
a
puddle
on
the
floor
and
held
the
inkpot
itself
ready
in
his
hand
he
listened
intently
but
heard
no
sound
no
sound
at
all
in
the
whole
house
and
this
increased
his
apprehensions
for
he
knew
well
that
deede
dawson
was
a
man
always
the
most
dangerous
when
most
silent
it
was
possible
of
course
that
he
had
fled
but
not
likely
he
would
not
go
rupert
thought
till
he
had
made
his
preparations
and
not
without
a
last
effort
to
take
revenge
on
those
who
had
defeated
him
and
in
this
dramatic
way
turned
the
mate
he
had
expected
to
secure
into
a
win
for
his
opponent
still
rupert
listened
intently
straining
his
ears
to
catch
the
least
sound
to
hint
to
him
where
his
enemy
was
for
he
knew
that
if
he
failed
to
discover
him
his
first
intimation
of
his
proximity
might
well
come
in
the
shape
of
the
sting
of
a
bullet
rending
flesh
and
bone
then
too
where
was
ella
and
where
was
her
mother
there
was
something
inexpressibly
sinister
in
the
utter
quietness
of
the
house
a
quietness
not
at
all
of
peace
and
rest
but
of
a
brooding
angry
threat
still
he
could
hear
nothing
and
he
left
the
room
very
quickly
and
noiselessly
and
he
made
sure
there
was
no
one
anywhere
in
any
of
these
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
he
locked
the
front
door
and
the
back
to
make
sure
no
one
should
enter
or
leave
too
easily
and
returned
on
tiptoe
moving
to
and
fro
like
a
shadow
cast
by
a
changing
light
so
swift
and
noiseless
were
his
movements
for
a
little
he
remained
crouching
against
the
side
of
the
stairway
listening
for
any
sound
that
might
float
down
to
him
from
above
but
none
came
and
on
a
sudden
in
one
movement
as
it
were
he
ran
up
the
stairs
and
crouched
down
on
the
topmost
one
so
that
any
bullet
aimed
at
him
as
he
appeared
might
perhaps
fly
overhead
but
none
was
fired
there
was
still
no
sound
at
all
no
sign
that
the
house
held
any
living
creature
beside
himself
he
began
to
think
that
deede
dawson
must
have
sent
the
two
women
away
and
now
have
gone
himself
but
there
was
the
pen
downstairs
with
ink
still
wet
upon
the
nib
to
prove
that
he
had
been
here
recently
and
again
very
suddenly
rupert
leaped
to
his
feet
and
ran
noiselessly
down
the
corridor
and
entered
quickly
into
ella
room
he
had
not
been
in
it
since
the
night
of
his
arrival
at
bittermeads
but
it
appeared
to
him
extraordinarily
familiar
and
every
little
object
in
it
of
ornament
or
use
seemed
to
speak
to
him
softly
of
ella
gracious
presence
of
ella
herself
there
was
no
sign
but
he
noticed
that
the
tassel
at
the
end
of
the
window
blind
cord
was
moving
as
if
recently
disturbed
the
movement
was
very
slight
almost
imperceptible
indeed
but
it
existed
and
it
proved
that
some
one
must
very
shortly
before
have
been
standing
at
the
window
he
moved
to
it
and
looked
out
the
view
commanded
the
road
by
which
he
had
approached
bittermeads
and
he
wondered
if
ella
had
been
standing
there
and
had
seen
his
approach
and
then
had
concealed
herself
for
some
reason
but
if
so
why
and
where
was
she
hiding
and
where
was
deede
dawson
and
why
was
everything
so
silent
and
so
still
he
turned
from
the
window
and
as
he
did
so
he
caught
a
faint
sound
in
the
passage
without
instantly
he
crouched
behind
the
bed
the
heavy
glass
inkpot
that
was
his
one
weapon
poised
in
his
hand
the
sound
did
not
come
again
but
as
he
waited
he
saw
the
door
begin
to
open
very
slowly
very
quietly
lower
still
he
crouched
the
inkpot
ready
to
throw
every
nerve
taut
and
tense
for
the
leap
at
his
foe
throat
with
which
he
meant
to
follow
it
up
the
door
opened
a
little
more
very
slowly
very
carefully
it
was
wide
enough
now
to
admit
of
entry
and
through
the
opening
there
sidled
pale
and
ella
mother
looking
so
frail
and
feeble
and
so
ruffled
and
disturbed
she
reminded
rupert
irresistibly
of
a
frightened
hen
she
edged
her
way
in
as
though
she
dared
not
open
the
door
too
widely
and
rupert
hesitated
in
great
perplexity
and
vexation
for
he
saw
that
he
must
show
himself
and
he
feared
that
she
would
announce
his
presence
by
flight
or
screams
but
he
could
not
possibly
get
away
without
her
knowledge
and
besides
she
might
be
able
to
give
him
useful
information
he
stood
up
quickly
with
his
finger
to
his
lips
hush
he
said
not
a
sound
not
a
the
warning
seemed
unnecessary
for
dawson
appeared
too
paralysed
with
fear
to
utter
even
the
faintest
cry
as
she
dropped
tremblingly
on
the
nearest
chair
hush
hush
he
said
where
is
ella
i
i
do
know
quavered
dawson
when
did
you
see
her
last
a
little
while
ago
dawson
faltered
she
went
upstairs
she
did
come
down
so
i
thought
i
would
try
to
find
where
deede
dawson
rupert
asked
i
i
do
know
she
quavered
again
when
did
you
see
him
last
i
i
a
little
while
ago
she
faltered
he
went
upstairs
he
come
down
again
i
thought
i
would
try
to
find
her
him
i
was
so
frightened
when
they
did
either
of
them
come
down
it
was
evident
she
was
far
too
confused
and
upset
to
give
any
useful
information
of
any
nature
even
if
she
knew
anything
deede
been
so
strange
she
said
and
ella
too
i
think
very
hard
on
me
dreams
too
he
said
he
wanted
her
to
help
him
get
a
ready
he
had
to
send
away
somewhere
i
do
know
where
i
do
think
ella
wanted
to
a
rupert
muttered
what
for
it
what
they
came
upstairs
to
do
dawson
said
and
and
she
began
to
cry
feebly
it
my
nerves
she
said
he
looked
so
strange
at
us
all
day
and
neither
of
them
has
come
down
chapter
xxix
the
attic
it
was
evident
that
more
had
occurred
to
make
dawson
afraid
that
she
would
or
perhaps
could
say
wait
here
rupert
said
to
her
do
the
command
seemed
superfluous
for
she
had
not
at
that
moment
the
appearance
of
still
possessing
the
power
to
move
without
speaking
again
rupert
left
the
room
and
went
quickly
to
the
foot
of
the
narrow
stairs
that
led
to
the
attics
above
he
listened
crouching
there
and
heard
nothing
and
a
cold
fear
came
to
him
that
perhaps
deede
dawson
had
done
up
above
what
he
wished
to
do
and
then
effected
his
escape
while
he
himself
had
been
lingering
in
room
adopting
his
plan
of
a
rapid
rush
to
disconcert
the
aim
of
any
one
who
might
be
about
to
fire
at
him
he
made
a
swift
dash
up
the
stairs
and
on
the
topmost
one
crouched
down
again
and
waited
but
still
nothing
happened
all
was
very
quiet
and
the
door
of
one
attic
the
one
which
had
been
assigned
to
him
as
a
was
wide
open
so
that
he
could
see
into
it
and
see
that
it
was
unoccupied
but
the
doors
of
both
the
others
were
closed
and
as
he
looked
he
made
out
in
the
gloom
for
this
landing
by
the
attic
was
very
by
a
small
and
skylight
a
scattered
dozen
or
so
of
hairpins
and
a
tortoiseshell
comb
such
as
he
had
seen
sometimes
in
ella
hair
lying
on
the
floor
near
the
door
of
the
larger
of
the
two
attics
the
one
in
which
he
remembered
well
he
had
found
deede
dawson
on
a
certain
night
busy
measuring
and
examining
an
empty
with
one
quick
rush
he
crossed
the
landing
and
flung
himself
at
the
door
it
opened
at
once
for
it
was
not
locked
and
within
he
saw
deede
dawson
in
his
hand
standing
behind
a
large
the
lid
of
which
he
had
apparently
that
minute
finished
fastening
down
he
looked
up
as
rupert
entered
thus
precipitately
and
he
showed
no
sign
of
surprise
or
alarm
you
back
early
he
said
something
gone
wrong
what
are
you
doing
what
in
there
rupert
asked
looking
at
the
his
mouth
and
lips
so
suddenly
dry
he
found
it
difficult
to
speak
at
all
deede
dawson
began
to
laugh
a
low
and
dreadful
laughter
that
had
in
it
no
trace
of
merriment
at
all
but
only
of
mockery
and
malice
it
was
such
laughter
as
a
devil
from
the
nethermost
pit
might
give
vent
to
when
he
saw
at
last
a
good
man
yield
to
long
temptation
what
in
there
rupert
said
again
pointing
to
the
and
it
was
as
though
his
soul
swooned
within
him
for
fear
of
what
the
answer
might
be
what
do
the
children
say
deede
dawson
returned
with
his
terrible
smile
i
give
you
three
guesses
is
it
see
if
you
can
guess
in
three
what
in
there
rupert
asked
the
third
time
and
deede
dawson
laid
down
the
with
which
he
had
just
driven
home
the
last
screw
oh
see
for
yourself
if
you
want
to
he
said
but
you
ought
to
know
you
know
what
was
in
the
other
case
i
sent
away
from
here
the
one
i
got
ella
to
take
in
the
car
for
me
i
want
you
to
take
this
one
away
now
the
sooner
it
away
the
that
it
is
it
rupert
muttered
he
no
longer
doubted
and
for
a
moment
all
things
swam
together
before
him
and
he
felt
dizzy
and
a
little
sick
and
so
weak
he
staggered
and
nearly
fell
but
recovered
himself
in
time
the
sensation
passed
and
he
saw
deede
dawson
as
it
were
a
long
way
off
and
between
them
the
huge
monstrous
and
evil
like
a
thing
of
dread
from
some
other
world
violent
shudderings
swept
though
him
one
after
the
other
and
he
was
aware
that
deede
dawson
was
speaking
again
what
did
you
say
he
asked
vacantly
when
the
other
paused
you
look
ill
deede
dawson
answered
anything
wrong
why
have
you
come
back
so
soon
have
you
failed
rupert
passed
his
hand
before
his
eyes
to
clear
away
the
mist
that
hung
there
and
that
hampered
his
sight
he
perceived
that
deede
dawson
held
his
right
hand
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
grasping
something
that
bulged
out
curiously
he
divined
that
it
was
a
pistol
and
that
deede
dawson
was
ready
to
shoot
at
any
moment
but
that
he
wished
very
greatly
to
know
first
of
all
what
had
happened
and
why
rupert
had
returned
so
soon
and
whether
there
was
immediate
necessity
for
flight
or
not
that
he
was
uneasy
was
certain
for
his
cold
eyes
showed
a
hesitation
and
a
doubt
such
as
rupert
had
never
seen
in
them
before
i
tell
you
what
happened
rupert
heard
himself
saying
hoarsely
if
you
tell
me
what
in
a
bargain
eh
deede
dawson
said
it
easy
enough
you
can
look
for
yourself
if
you
unscrew
the
lid
but
then
after
all
why
should
we
take
all
that
trouble
as
he
spoke
his
pistol
showed
in
his
hand
and
at
once
the
heavy
glass
inkpot
rupert
had
held
all
this
time
flew
straight
and
true
and
with
tremendous
force
at
deede
dawson
head
he
avoided
it
only
by
the
extreme
rapidity
with
which
he
dropped
behind
the
and
it
flew
over
his
head
and
crashed
against
the
centre
panel
of
a
big
wardrobe
that
stood
in
one
corner
of
the
room
splitting
the
panel
it
struck
from
top
to
bottom
following
it
rupert
hurled
himself
forward
with
one
great
spring
but
agile
as
a
cat
that
leaps
away
from
the
mastiff
teeth
deede
dawson
slipped
from
his
grasp
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
in
doing
so
he
knocked
his
arm
against
the
corner
of
the
so
that
his
revolver
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
shout
rupert
stooped
and
seized
it
and
straightened
himself
to
see
that
deede
dawson
had
already
another
revolver
in
his
hand
a
second
one
that
he
had
drawn
from
an
inner
pocket
they
remained
very
still
watching
each
other
intently
neither
eager
to
fire
since
both
wished
first
to
make
the
other
speak
for
rupert
desired
very
greatly
that
deede
dawson
should
tell
him
where
ella
was
and
deede
dawson
needed
that
rupert
should
explain
what
had
gone
wrong
and
how
imminent
and
great
was
the
danger
that
therefore
most
likely
threatened
him
each
knew
too
that
the
slightest
movement
he
made
would
set
the
other
shooting
and
each
realized
that
in
that
close
and
narrow
space
any
exchange
of
shots
must
almost
of
necessity
mean
the
death
of
both
since
both
were
cool
and
deadly
marksmen
well
accustomed
to
the
use
of
the
revolver
deede
dawson
was
the
first
to
speak
well
what
next
he
said
if
that
inkpot
of
yours
had
hit
me
it
would
pretty
well
have
knocked
my
brains
out
and
if
i
had
hit
my
elbow
against
the
corner
of
the
i
would
have
had
you
shot
through
with
holes
like
a
sieve
by
now
so
far
the
score
even
let
chat
a
bit
and
see
if
we
ca
come
to
some
arrangement
look
i
show
i
trust
as
he
spoke
he
laid
down
much
to
rupert
surprise
and
to
his
equal
suspicion
his
revolver
on
the
top
of
a
roll
of
old
carpet
that
leaned
against
the
wall
near
where
he
was
standing
you
see
i
trust
you
he
said
once
more
take
your
pistol
up
again
answered
rupert
grimly
i
do
not
trust
ah
that
a
deede
dawson
smiled
making
no
effort
to
do
as
the
other
said
you
see
we
are
both
good
shots
and
if
we
start
blazing
away
at
each
other
up
here
we
shall
both
be
leaking
pretty
badly
before
long
that
a
prospect
that
has
no
attraction
for
me
i
do
know
if
it
has
for
you
but
there
are
things
i
can
tell
you
that
might
be
interesting
and
things
you
can
tell
me
i
want
to
know
why
not
exchange
a
little
information
and
then
separate
calmly
rather
than
indulge
in
pistol
practice
that
can
only
mean
the
death
of
us
both
for
if
your
first
bullet
goes
through
my
brain
i
swear
my
first
will
be
in
your
likely
enough
agreed
rupert
but
worth
while
oh
that
fanaticism
deede
dawson
answered
flattering
perhaps
to
me
but
not
quite
reasonable
eh
there
only
one
thing
i
want
to
know
from
you
rupert
said
slowly
then
why
not
ask
it
why
not
agree
to
the
little
arrangement
i
suggest
eh
eh
rupert
dunsmore
you
know
me
then
oh
long
where
is
ella
deede
dawson
laughed
again
that
a
thing
i
know
and
you
do
he
said
well
she
safe
away
in
london
by
this
that
a
lie
for
her
mother
here
still
answered
rupert
even
though
his
heart
leapt
merely
to
hear
the
words
unbelieving
thomas
smiled
the
other
well
then
she
is
where
she
is
and
that
you
can
find
out
for
yourself
but
i
make
another
suggestion
we
are
both
good
shots
and
if
we
start
to
fire
we
shall
kill
each
other
i
am
certain
of
killing
you
but
i
sha
escape
myself
well
then
why
not
toss
for
it
equal
chances
for
both
and
certain
safety
for
one
will
you
toss
me
the
one
who
loses
to
give
up
his
pistol
to
the
other
it
seems
to
me
a
good
idea
deede
dawson
argued
here
we
are
watching
each
other
like
cats
and
knowing
that
the
least
movement
of
either
will
start
the
other
off
and
both
of
us
pulling
trigger
as
hard
as
we
can
my
idea
would
mean
a
chance
for
one
well
let
try
another
way
the
best
shot
to
win
you
do
trust
me
but
i
will
leaving
his
pistol
lying
where
he
had
put
it
down
he
crossed
the
attic
and
with
a
pencil
he
took
from
his
pocket
drew
a
circle
on
the
panel
of
the
wardrobe
door
that
rupert
had
split
with
the
inkpot
he
had
thrown
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
he
marked
a
dot
and
turned
smilingly
to
the
frowning
and
suspicious
rupert
there
you
are
he
said
and
made
another
circle
near
the
first
one
now
you
put
a
bullet
into
the
middle
of
this
circle
and
i
put
one
afterwards
through
the
second
circle
and
the
one
who
is
nearest
to
the
dots
i
marked
wins
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
seems
to
me
better
than
our
killing
each
other
is
it
i
think
you
playing
the
fool
for
some
reason
of
your
own
answered
rupert
there
only
one
thing
i
want
to
know
from
you
where
is
ella
let
me
know
how
you
can
shoot
answered
deede
dawson
and
i
tell
you
by
all
that
holy
i
rupert
hesitated
he
did
not
understand
all
this
he
could
not
imagine
what
motive
was
in
deede
dawson
mind
though
it
was
certainly
true
enough
that
once
they
began
shooting
at
each
other
neither
man
was
at
all
likely
to
survive
for
rupert
knew
he
would
not
miss
and
he
did
not
think
deede
dawson
would
either
above
all
there
was
the
one
thing
he
wished
to
know
the
one
consideration
that
weighed
with
him
above
all
others
what
had
become
of
ella
and
this
time
there
had
been
in
deede
dawson
voice
an
accent
of
twisted
and
malign
sincerity
that
seemed
to
say
he
really
would
be
willing
to
tell
the
truth
about
her
if
rupert
would
gratify
his
whim
about
this
sort
of
that
he
was
suggesting
the
purpose
of
it
rupert
could
not
understand
but
it
did
not
seem
to
him
there
would
be
any
risk
of
harm
in
agreeing
for
deede
dawson
was
standing
so
far
away
from
his
own
weapon
he
could
not
well
be
contemplating
any
immediate
mischief
or
treachery
it
did
occur
to
him
that
the
pistol
he
held
might
be
loaded
in
one
chamber
only
and
that
deede
dawson
might
be
scheming
to
induce
him
to
throw
away
his
solitary
cartridge
but
a
glance
reassured
him
on
that
point
let
me
see
how
you
can
shoot
deede
dawson
repeated
leaning
carelessly
with
folded
arms
against
the
wall
a
little
distance
away
and
i
promise
you
i
tell
you
where
ella
rupert
lifted
his
pistol
and
was
indeed
on
the
very
point
of
firing
when
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
such
evil
triumph
and
delight
in
deede
cold
eyes
that
he
hesitated
and
lowered
the
weapon
and
at
the
same
time
looking
more
closely
searching
more
intently
for
some
indication
of
deede
dawson
hidden
purpose
he
noticed
caught
in
the
crack
of
the
wardrobe
door
a
tiny
shred
of
some
blue
material
only
just
visible
he
remembered
that
sometimes
of
an
afternoon
ella
had
been
accustomed
to
wear
a
frock
made
of
a
material
exactly
like
that
of
which
so
tiny
a
fragment
showed
now
in
the
crack
of
the
wardrobe
door
chapter
xxx
some
explanations
he
turned
quickly
towards
deede
dawson
their
eyes
met
and
in
that
mutual
glance
rupert
dunsmore
read
that
his
suspicions
were
correct
and
deede
dawson
that
his
dreadful
trap
was
discovered
neither
spoke
for
a
brief
moment
they
remained
impassive
immobile
their
eyes
meeting
like
blows
and
then
deede
dawson
made
one
spring
to
seize
again
the
revolver
he
had
laid
down
in
the
hope
of
enticing
rupert
into
the
awful
snare
prepared
for
him
but
quick
as
he
was
rupert
was
quicker
still
and
as
deede
dawson
leaped
he
lifted
his
pistol
and
fired
though
his
aim
was
not
at
the
man
but
at
the
revolver
lying
on
the
top
of
the
roll
of
carpet
where
deede
dawson
had
placed
it
the
bullet
for
rupert
was
a
man
who
seldom
missed
struck
the
weapon
fair
and
whirled
it
shattered
and
useless
to
the
floor
deede
dawson
whose
hand
had
been
already
outstretched
to
seize
it
drew
back
with
a
snarl
that
was
more
like
the
cry
of
a
trapped
wolf
than
any
sound
produced
from
human
lips
still
rupert
did
not
speak
with
the
smoking
pistol
in
his
hand
he
watched
silently
and
steadily
his
helpless
enemy
who
for
his
part
was
silent
too
and
very
still
for
he
felt
that
doom
was
close
upon
him
yet
he
showed
not
the
least
sign
of
fear
but
only
a
fierce
and
sullen
defiance
shoot
away
why
do
you
shoot
he
sneered
mind
you
do
miss
i
trusted
you
when
i
put
my
revolver
down
and
i
was
a
fool
but
i
thought
you
would
play
without
a
word
rupert
tossed
his
pistol
through
the
attic
window
they
heard
the
tinkling
fall
of
the
glass
they
heard
more
faintly
the
sound
of
the
revolver
striking
the
outhouse
roof
twenty
feet
below
and
rebounding
thence
to
the
paved
kitchen
yard
beneath
and
then
all
was
quiet
again
i
only
need
my
hands
for
you
said
rupert
softly
as
softly
as
a
mother
coos
to
her
drowsy
babe
my
hands
for
for
the
first
time
deede
dawson
seemed
to
fear
for
indeed
there
was
that
in
rupert
dunsmore
eyes
to
rouse
fear
in
any
man
with
a
sudden
swift
spring
rupert
leaped
forward
and
deede
dawson
not
daring
to
abide
that
onslaught
turned
and
ran
screaming
shrilly
during
the
space
of
one
brief
moment
a
dreadful
and
appalling
moment
there
was
a
wild
strange
hunting
up
and
down
the
narrow
space
of
that
upper
attic
cumbered
with
lumber
and
old
disused
furniture
round
and
round
deede
dawson
fled
screaming
still
in
a
high
shrill
way
like
some
wild
thing
in
pain
and
hard
upon
him
followed
rupert
nor
had
they
gone
a
second
time
about
that
room
before
rupert
had
deede
dawson
in
a
fast
embrace
his
arms
about
the
other
middle
one
last
great
cry
deede
dawson
gave
when
rupert
seized
him
and
then
was
silent
as
rupert
lifted
him
and
swung
him
high
at
arm
length
as
a
child
in
play
sports
with
its
doll
so
rupert
swung
deede
dawson
twice
about
his
head
round
and
round
and
then
loosed
him
so
that
he
went
hurling
through
the
air
with
awful
force
like
a
stone
shot
from
a
catapult
clean
through
the
window
through
which
rupert
had
the
moment
before
tossed
his
pistol
with
but
little
more
apparent
effort
right
through
the
window
bearing
panes
and
sash
with
him
deede
dawson
flew
with
the
impetus
of
that
great
throw
and
out
beyond
and
down
turning
over
and
over
the
while
down
through
the
empty
air
to
fall
and
be
shattered
like
a
piece
of
worthless
crockery
on
the
stone
threshold
of
the
outhouse
door
surprised
to
find
himself
alone
rupert
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
and
looked
vacantly
around
my
god
what
have
i
done
he
thought
he
was
trembling
violently
and
the
fury
of
the
passion
that
had
possessed
him
and
had
given
his
mighty
muscles
a
force
more
than
human
was
still
upon
him
going
to
the
window
he
looked
out
for
he
did
not
quite
know
what
had
happened
and
from
it
he
looked
back
at
the
wardrobe
door
oh
yes
he
said
he
ran
to
it
and
tore
open
the
door
and
from
within
very
tenderly
and
gently
he
lifted
down
the
ella
who
securely
gagged
and
tightly
bound
had
been
thrust
into
its
interior
to
conceal
her
from
him
hurriedly
he
freed
her
from
her
bonds
and
from
the
handkerchief
that
was
tied
over
her
mouth
and
holding
her
in
his
arms
like
a
child
pressing
her
close
to
his
heart
he
carried
her
lightly
out
of
that
dreadful
room
only
once
did
she
stir
only
once
did
she
speak
when
lifting
her
pale
strained
face
to
him
she
murmured
very
faintly
something
in
which
he
just
caught
the
words
deede
he
trouble
us
no
more
nor
any
one
else
i
think
answered
rupert
and
she
said
no
more
but
snuggled
down
in
his
arms
as
though
with
a
feeling
of
perfect
security
and
safety
he
took
her
to
her
own
room
and
left
her
with
her
mother
and
then
went
down
to
the
hall
and
took
a
chair
and
sat
at
the
front
door
all
at
once
he
felt
very
tired
and
one
of
his
shoulders
hurt
him
for
he
had
strained
a
muscle
there
rather
badly
his
one
desire
was
to
rest
and
he
did
not
even
trouble
to
go
round
to
the
back
of
the
house
to
see
what
had
happened
to
deede
dawson
though
indeed
that
was
not
a
point
on
which
he
entertained
much
doubt
for
a
long
time
he
sat
there
quietly
till
at
last
his
father
arrived
in
a
from
wreste
abbey
together
with
a
from
the
county
town
whom
he
had
picked
up
on
the
way
rupert
took
them
into
the
room
where
deede
dawson
chessmen
and
the
board
were
still
standing
and
told
them
as
briefly
as
he
could
what
had
happened
since
the
first
day
when
he
had
left
his
home
to
try
to
trace
out
and
defeat
the
plot
hatched
by
walter
dunsmore
and
deede
dawson
you
people
would
act
he
said
to
the
inspector
you
said
there
was
no
evidence
no
proof
and
i
daresay
you
were
right
enough
from
the
legal
point
of
view
but
it
was
plain
enough
to
me
that
there
was
some
sort
of
conspiracy
against
my
uncle
life
i
thought
against
my
father
as
well
but
i
was
not
sure
of
that
at
first
it
was
through
poor
charley
wright
i
became
so
certain
he
found
out
things
and
told
me
about
them
but
for
him
the
first
attempt
to
poison
my
uncle
would
have
succeeded
even
then
we
had
still
no
evidence
to
prove
the
reality
of
our
suspicions
for
walter
destroyed
it
by
accident
i
thought
at
the
time
purposely
as
i
know
now
it
was
something
walter
said
that
gave
charley
the
idea
of
coming
here
then
he
vanished
he
must
have
roused
their
suspicions
somehow
and
they
killed
him
but
again
walter
put
us
all
off
the
scent
by
his
story
of
having
seen
charley
in
london
so
that
it
was
there
the
search
for
him
was
made
and
no
one
ever
thought
of
bittermeads
i
never
suspected
walter
such
an
idea
never
entered
my
head
but
luckily
i
did
tell
him
of
my
idea
of
coming
to
bittermeads
myself
to
try
to
find
out
what
was
really
going
on
here
he
knew
nothing
of
where
i
was
till
i
told
him
that
day
at
wreste
abbey
then
of
course
he
came
over
here
at
once
i
thought
it
was
anxiety
for
my
safety
but
i
expect
really
it
was
to
warn
his
friends
when
i
saw
him
here
that
night
i
told
him
every
single
thing
i
trusted
the
of
everything
i
had
arranged
to
him
if
it
had
been
for
a
note
miss
cayley
wrote
me
to
warn
me
i
should
have
walked
right
into
the
trap
and
so
would
my
father
the
asked
a
few
questions
and
then
made
a
search
of
the
room
which
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
quite
sufficient
proof
of
the
guilt
of
deede
dawson
and
of
walter
dunsmore
among
these
proofs
was
also
a
note
from
walter
that
solved
the
mystery
of
john
clive
death
it
was
not
signed
but
both
general
dunsmore
and
rupert
knew
his
writing
and
were
prepared
to
swear
to
it
beginning
abruptly
and
scribbled
on
a
torn
scrap
of
paper
it
ran
i
found
clive
where
you
said
lucky
you
got
hold
of
the
note
and
read
it
before
she
sent
it
for
no
doubt
she
meant
to
warn
him
take
care
she
gets
no
chance
of
the
sort
again
i
did
clive
business
all
right
she
saw
me
and
i
think
recognized
me
from
that
time
she
saw
me
over
the
business
before
i
took
it
out
to
sink
it
at
sea
at
any
rate
she
ran
off
in
a
great
hurry
if
you
are
careful
she
make
trouble
apparently
remarked
the
inspector
when
he
had
read
this
aloud
the
young
lady
was
very
luckily
not
watched
closely
enough
and
did
make
trouble
for
them
could
i
see
her
do
you
think
i
do
know
i
go
and
ask
rupert
said
ella
was
still
very
shaken
but
she
consented
to
see
the
inspector
and
they
all
went
together
to
her
room
where
she
was
lying
on
her
bed
with
her
mother
fussing
nervously
about
her
she
told
them
in
as
few
words
as
possible
the
story
of
how
she
had
always
disliked
and
mistrusted
the
man
whom
so
unfortunately
her
mother
had
married
and
how
gradually
her
suspicions
strengthened
till
she
became
certain
that
he
was
involved
in
many
unlawful
deeds
but
always
her
inner
certainty
had
fallen
short
of
absolute
proof
so
careful
had
he
been
in
all
he
did
i
knew
i
knew
she
said
but
there
was
nothing
i
really
knew
and
he
made
me
do
all
sorts
of
things
for
him
i
would
have
cared
for
myself
but
if
i
tried
to
refuse
he
made
mother
suffer
she
was
very
very
frightened
of
him
but
she
would
never
leave
him
she
did
dare
there
was
one
night
he
made
me
go
very
late
with
a
full
of
silver
things
he
had
and
he
would
tell
me
where
he
had
got
them
i
believe
he
stole
them
all
but
i
helped
him
pack
them
and
i
took
them
away
the
night
dunsmore
came
and
gave
them
to
a
man
wearing
a
mask
my
stepfather
said
it
was
just
a
secret
family
matter
he
was
helping
some
friends
in
and
later
on
i
saw
the
same
man
in
the
woods
near
here
one
day
the
day
clive
was
killed
by
the
poachers
and
when
he
came
another
time
to
the
house
i
thought
i
must
try
to
find
out
what
he
wanted
i
listened
while
they
talked
and
they
said
such
strange
things
i
made
up
my
mind
to
try
to
warn
dunsmore
for
i
was
sure
there
was
something
they
were
there
was
indeed
said
rupert
grimly
and
but
for
that
warning
you
sent
me
they
would
have
somehow
they
found
out
what
i
had
done
ella
continued
as
soon
as
i
got
back
he
kept
looking
at
me
so
strangely
i
was
afraid
i
had
been
afraid
a
long
time
for
that
matter
but
i
tried
not
to
show
it
in
the
afternoon
he
told
me
to
go
up
to
the
attic
he
said
he
wanted
me
to
help
him
pack
some
silver
it
was
the
same
silver
i
had
packed
before
for
some
reason
he
had
got
it
back
again
this
time
i
had
to
pack
it
in
the
little
boxes
and
after
i
had
finished
i
waited
up
there
till
suddenly
he
ran
in
very
quickly
and
looking
very
excited
he
said
i
had
betrayed
them
and
should
suffer
for
it
and
he
took
some
rope
and
he
tied
me
as
tightly
as
he
could
and
tied
a
great
handkerchief
over
my
mouth
and
pushed
me
inside
the
wardrobe
and
locked
it
i
think
he
would
have
killed
me
then
only
he
was
afraid
of
dunsmore
and
very
anxious
to
know
what
had
happened
and
why
dunsmore
had
come
home
and
if
there
was
any
danger
and
i
was
a
long
time
there
and
i
heard
a
great
noise
and
then
dunsmore
opened
the
door
and
took
me
chapter
xxxi
conclusion
three
months
had
passed
and
in
a
quiet
little
cottage
on
the
outskirts
of
a
small
country
town
situated
in
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
peaceful
vales
of
the
country
ella
was
slowly
recovering
from
the
shock
of
the
dreadful
experiences
through
which
she
had
passed
she
had
been
ill
for
some
weeks
but
her
mother
fussily
incompetent
at
most
times
was
always
at
her
best
when
sickness
came
and
she
had
nursed
her
daughter
devotedly
and
successfully
as
soon
as
possible
they
had
come
to
this
quiet
little
place
where
people
busy
with
their
own
affairs
and
the
important
progress
of
the
town
had
scarcely
heard
of
what
the
newspapers
of
the
day
called
the
great
chobham
but
in
fact
very
much
to
rupert
relief
comparatively
little
had
been
made
known
publicly
and
the
whole
affair
had
attracted
wonderfully
little
attention
the
one
public
proceeding
had
been
the
inquest
of
deede
dawson
and
that
the
coroner
at
the
request
of
the
police
eagerly
searching
for
walter
dunsmore
had
made
as
brief
and
formal
as
possible
under
his
direction
the
jury
had
returned
a
verdict
of
justifiable
homicide
and
illness
had
had
at
least
one
good
result
of
making
it
impossible
for
her
to
attend
to
give
her
evidence
in
person
at
a
trial
of
course
everything
would
have
had
to
be
told
in
full
but
both
allen
deede
dawson
accomplice
and
walter
dunsmore
his
instigator
and
employer
had
vanished
utterly
for
walter
the
search
was
very
hot
but
so
far
entirely
without
result
now
could
allen
be
found
he
was
identified
with
a
fair
degree
of
certainty
as
an
old
criminal
well
known
to
the
authorities
and
it
was
thought
almost
certain
that
he
had
had
previous
dealings
with
deede
dawson
and
knew
enough
about
him
to
be
able
to
force
himself
into
bittermeads
of
the
actual
plot
in
operation
there
he
most
likely
knew
little
or
nothing
but
probably
deede
dawson
thought
he
might
be
useful
and
the
store
of
silver
found
in
the
attic
that
ella
had
been
employed
in
packing
ready
for
removal
was
identified
as
part
of
the
plunder
from
a
recent
burglary
in
a
northern
town
it
was
thought
therefore
that
both
allen
and
deede
dawson
might
have
been
concerned
in
that
affair
that
deede
dawson
had
managed
to
secure
the
greater
share
of
the
booty
and
that
allen
on
the
night
when
rupert
found
him
breaking
into
bittermeads
was
endeavouring
to
get
hold
of
the
silver
for
himself
but
the
actual
facts
are
not
likely
now
ever
to
be
known
for
from
that
day
to
this
nothing
has
been
heard
of
allen
his
old
haunts
know
him
no
more
and
to
his
record
carefully
preserved
at
scotland
yard
there
have
been
no
recent
additions
one
theory
is
that
deede
dawson
finding
him
troublesome
took
effectual
steps
to
dispose
of
him
another
is
that
deede
dawson
got
him
away
by
either
bribes
or
threats
and
that
not
knowing
of
deede
dawson
death
he
does
not
venture
to
return
in
any
case
he
was
a
commonplace
criminal
and
his
fate
is
of
little
interest
to
any
one
but
himself
it
was
walter
for
whom
the
police
hunted
with
diligence
and
effort
but
with
a
total
lack
of
success
so
that
they
began
to
think
at
the
end
of
three
months
that
he
must
somehow
have
succeeded
in
making
his
way
out
of
the
country
during
the
first
portion
of
this
time
rupert
had
been
very
busy
with
a
great
many
things
that
needed
his
attention
and
then
lord
chobham
his
health
affected
by
the
crimes
and
treachery
of
a
kinsman
whom
he
had
known
and
trusted
as
he
had
known
and
trusted
walter
was
attacked
by
acute
bronchitis
which
affected
his
heart
and
carried
him
off
within
the
week
the
title
and
estates
passed
therefore
to
general
dunsmore
and
rupert
became
the
honourable
rupert
dunsmore
and
the
direct
heir
all
this
meant
for
him
a
great
deal
more
to
see
to
and
arrange
for
the
health
of
the
new
lord
chobham
had
also
been
affected
and
he
left
practically
everything
in
his
son
hands
so
that
except
for
the
letters
which
came
regularly
but
had
been
often
written
in
great
haste
ella
knew
and
heard
little
of
rupert
but
today
he
was
to
come
for
everything
was
finally
in
order
and
though
this
she
did
not
know
till
later
walter
dunsmore
had
at
last
been
discovered
dead
from
poison
in
a
wretched
lodging
in
an
east
end
slum
rupert
had
been
called
to
identify
the
body
and
he
had
been
able
to
arrange
it
so
that
very
little
was
said
at
the
inquest
where
the
customary
verdict
of
suicide
during
temporary
insanity
was
duly
returned
by
a
quite
uninterested
jury
that
the
last
had
been
heard
of
the
tragedy
that
had
so
nearly
overwhelmed
his
life
rupert
was
able
now
to
feel
fairly
well
assured
and
it
was
therefore
in
a
mood
more
cheerful
than
he
had
known
of
late
that
he
started
on
his
journey
to
ella
new
residence
he
had
sent
a
wire
to
confirm
his
letter
and
it
was
in
a
mood
that
was
more
than
a
little
nervous
that
she
busied
herself
with
her
preparations
she
chose
her
very
simplest
gown
and
when
there
was
absolutely
nothing
more
to
do
she
went
into
their
little
to
wait
alone
by
the
fire
she
had
built
up
there
for
it
was
winter
now
and
today
was
cold
and
inclined
to
be
stormy
rupert
had
not
said
exactly
when
she
was
to
expect
him
and
she
sat
for
a
long
time
by
the
fire
starting
at
every
sound
and
imagining
at
every
moment
that
she
heard
the
bell
ring
i
shall
not
let
him
feel
himself
bound
she
said
to
herself
with
great
decision
i
shall
tell
him
i
hope
we
shall
always
be
friends
but
all
and
if
he
wants
anything
more
i
shall
say
no
but
most
likely
he
wo
say
a
word
about
all
that
nonsense
it
would
be
silly
to
take
seriously
what
he
said
to
ella
now
bittermeads
was
always
there
and
though
she
told
herself
several
times
that
probably
rupert
had
not
the
least
idea
of
repeating
what
he
had
said
to
her
there
and
that
most
likely
he
was
coming
today
merely
to
make
a
friendly
call
and
that
it
would
never
do
for
either
of
them
to
think
again
of
what
they
had
said
when
they
were
both
so
excited
and
overwrought
yet
in
her
heart
she
knew
a
great
deal
better
than
all
that
but
she
said
to
herself
very
often
anyhow
i
shall
certainly
refuse
and
on
this
point
her
mind
was
irrevocably
made
up
since
after
all
whether
rupert
would
accept
refusal
or
not
would
still
remain
entirely
for
him
to
decide
at
three
she
heard
the
creak
and
when
she
ran
to
the
window
to
peep
she
saw
with
a
kind
of
chill
surprise
that
there
was
a
stranger
coming
through
some
one
he
sent
she
said
to
herself
he
does
want
to
come
himself
and
so
he
has
sent
some
one
else
instead
i
am
having
said
this
and
repeated
again
the
last
three
words
and
having
gulped
down
a
sob
presumably
of
joy
that
unexpectedly
fluttered
into
her
throat
she
went
quickly
to
open
the
door
the
stranger
smiled
at
her
as
she
showed
herself
but
did
not
speak
he
was
a
man
of
middle
height
quite
young
and
wrapped
in
a
big
loose
overcoat
that
very
completely
hid
his
figure
his
face
showed
clear
features
with
a
firm
mouth
round
which
at
this
moment
played
a
very
gentle
and
winning
smile
a
chin
and
extremely
bright
clear
kindly
eyes
that
were
just
now
smiling
too
when
he
took
off
his
hat
she
saw
that
his
hair
was
cut
rather
closely
and
very
neatly
brushed
and
combed
and
she
found
his
smile
so
compelling
and
so
winning
that
in
spite
of
her
disappointment
she
found
herself
returning
it
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
some
time
or
another
seen
some
one
like
this
stranger
but
when
or
where
she
could
not
imagine
still
he
did
not
speak
but
his
eyes
were
very
tender
and
kind
as
they
rested
on
her
so
that
she
wondered
a
little
yes
she
said
inquiringly
yes
do
you
know
me
ella
he
said
then
very
softly
and
in
a
voice
that
she
recognized
instantly
is
it
you
you
she
breathed
instinctively
she
lifted
her
hands
to
greet
him
and
at
once
she
found
herself
caught
up
and
held
pressed
passionately
to
his
heart
an
hour
later
by
the
fire
in
the
ella
suddenly
remembered
tea
good
gracious
you
must
be
starving
she
cried
smitten
with
remorse
and
there
poor
mother
waiting
upstairs
all
this
time
oh
rupert
are
you
very
hungry
starving
he
asserted
but
held
her
to
him
as
closely
as
ever
i
must
get
the
tea
she
protested
she
put
one
cheek
against
his
and
sighed
contentedly
it
nice
to
see
the
real
you
she
murmured
but
oh
rupert
i
do
miss
your
dear
bristly
beard
