chapter
mary
tells
all
she
knows
joyce
said
jack
ware
stopping
beside
his
sister
seat
in
the
long
train
i
wish
you
go
back
into
the
and
make
mary
stop
talking
she
telling
all
she
knows
to
a
couple
of
strangers
why
do
you
do
it
asked
joyce
looking
up
from
her
magazine
with
a
teasing
smile
that
dignified
scowl
of
yours
ought
to
frighten
anything
into
silence
i
did
try
it
confessed
jack
i
frowned
and
shook
my
head
at
her
as
i
passed
but
all
the
good
it
did
was
to
start
her
to
talking
about
my
brother
jack
i
heard
her
say
and
her
voice
went
through
the
car
like
a
needle
he
big
for
fourteen
been
wearing
long
trousers
for
nearly
a
year
they
both
turned
to
look
at
me
and
everybody
smiled
and
i
was
so
embarrassed
that
i
fell
all
over
myself
getting
out
of
sight
and
it
was
a
girl
she
said
it
to
he
continued
wrathfully
a
real
pretty
girl
about
my
age
the
fellow
with
her
is
her
brother
i
reckon
they
look
enough
alike
he
a
cadet
from
some
military
school
you
can
tell
by
his
uniform
they
laugh
at
everything
that
mary
says
and
that
makes
her
go
on
all
the
worse
so
if
you
do
want
them
to
know
all
our
family
history
past
present
and
to
come
you
better
go
back
and
shut
up
that
chatterbox
you
know
what
mary
like
when
she
gets
started
yes
i
know
sighed
joyce
but
i
do
dare
move
now
norman
has
just
fallen
asleep
and
he
been
so
restless
all
day
that
i
do
want
him
to
waken
until
mamma
has
had
her
nap
she
glanced
down
at
the
little
brother
stretched
out
on
the
seat
beside
her
with
his
head
in
her
lap
and
then
across
the
aisle
at
her
mother
lying
with
her
white
face
hidden
among
the
shawls
and
pillows
if
i
send
for
mary
to
come
back
here
she
flop
around
until
she
wakes
them
both
ca
you
get
her
out
on
to
the
rear
platform
for
awhile
i
should
think
she
would
enjoy
riding
out
there
on
one
of
those
little
slip
one
of
those
oranges
into
your
pocket
and
whisper
to
her
to
follow
you
out
and
guess
what
you
have
for
her
well
i
try
said
jack
dubiously
but
i
almost
sure
she
budge
it
is
every
day
she
gets
an
audience
like
that
it
flatters
her
to
have
them
laugh
at
everything
she
says
and
as
sure
as
i
stop
and
speak
to
her
she
say
something
that
i
do
want
to
hear
oh
never
mind
then
said
joyce
they
are
strangers
and
probably
we
never
see
them
again
so
it
wo
make
any
difference
sit
down
here
and
forget
about
them
you
can
have
this
magazine
in
a
minute
just
as
soon
as
i
finish
reading
this
but
jack
did
mind
he
could
not
forget
the
amused
glances
that
the
pretty
girl
had
exchanged
with
her
big
brother
and
after
standing
irresolutely
in
the
aisle
a
moment
he
strolled
back
to
the
slipping
into
a
wicker
chair
near
the
door
he
sat
waiting
for
mary
to
look
in
his
direction
so
that
he
could
beckon
her
to
come
to
him
half
the
passengers
had
gone
to
sleep
and
forgotten
that
they
were
being
whirled
across
the
great
american
desert
as
fast
as
the
limited
could
carry
them
some
were
reading
and
some
gazing
out
of
the
windows
at
the
monotonous
wastes
of
sand
the
only
ones
who
really
seemed
to
be
enjoying
the
journey
were
his
small
sister
and
her
audience
of
two
she
sat
on
a
footstool
in
the
aisle
just
in
front
of
them
a
box
of
candy
in
her
lap
and
a
look
of
supreme
satisfaction
on
her
face
two
little
braids
of
blond
hair
tied
with
big
bows
of
blue
ribbon
bobbed
over
her
shoulders
as
she
talked
jack
was
too
far
away
to
hear
what
she
said
but
his
scowl
deepened
whenever
the
girl
exchanged
amused
glances
with
her
brother
this
candy
is
almost
as
good
as
the
fudge
we
used
to
make
at
home
every
saturday
afternoon
said
mary
putting
a
marshmallow
in
her
mouth
and
gravely
running
her
tongue
around
her
lips
but
never
again
make
any
more
fudge
in
that
house
why
not
dear
asked
the
girl
with
encouraging
interest
this
child
was
the
most
diverting
thing
she
had
found
on
the
long
journey
oh
everything
has
come
to
an
end
now
joyce
says
you
can
never
go
back
when
you
burned
your
bridges
behind
you
it
was
certainly
burning
our
bridges
when
we
sold
the
little
brown
house
for
of
course
we
could
never
go
back
with
strangers
living
in
it
it
was
almost
like
a
funeral
when
we
started
to
the
train
and
looked
back
for
the
last
time
i
cried
because
there
was
the
standing
on
the
porch
with
the
strings
of
popcorn
and
cranberries
on
it
we
put
it
out
for
the
birds
you
know
when
we
were
done
with
it
when
i
saw
how
lonesome
it
looked
standing
out
in
the
snow
and
remembered
that
it
was
the
last
we
ever
have
there
and
that
we
did
have
a
home
any
more
why
i
guess
would
have
cried
why
did
you
sell
the
little
home
if
you
loved
it
so
asked
the
girl
it
was
not
from
any
desire
to
pry
into
a
stranger
affairs
that
she
asked
but
merely
to
keep
the
child
talking
oh
mamma
was
so
she
had
pneumonia
and
there
are
so
many
blizzards
in
kansas
you
know
that
the
doctor
said
she
never
get
rid
of
her
cough
if
she
stayed
in
plainsville
and
that
maybe
if
we
go
to
a
warm
place
she
would
live
till
spring
so
link
bought
the
house
the
very
next
day
so
that
we
could
have
enough
money
to
go
a
lawyer
it
used
to
be
link
and
ware
on
the
office
door
before
papa
died
he
always
been
good
to
us
because
he
was
papa
partner
and
he
gave
jack
a
perfectly
grand
gun
when
he
found
we
were
coming
out
among
the
indians
then
the
neighbours
came
in
and
helped
us
pack
and
we
left
in
a
hurry
we
be
to
the
place
where
we
are
going
and
we
begin
to
live
in
tents
on
new
year
day
you
never
think
this
was
the
last
day
of
the
old
year
would
you
it
so
warm
i
we
be
mixed
up
all
the
time
now
about
the
calendar
coming
to
such
a
different
climate
there
was
a
pause
while
another
marshmallow
disappeared
then
she
prattled
on
again
it
to
lee
ranch
we
are
going
out
in
arizona
it
a
sort
of
for
sick
people
lee
keeps
it
our
minister
sister
and
he
wrote
to
her
and
she
going
to
take
us
cheaper
than
she
does
most
people
because
there
so
many
of
us
joyce
and
jack
and
holland
and
norman
and
mamma
and
me
makes
an
even
but
we
going
to
keep
house
as
soon
as
our
things
come
and
we
can
get
a
place
and
then
i
be
glad
that
jack
has
his
gun
he
ca
shoot
very
well
yet
unless
it
at
something
big
like
a
stable
door
but
you
always
feel
safer
when
there
indians
around
if
got
something
to
bang
at
them
here
she
lowered
her
voice
confidentially
holland
scared
norman
and
me
most
to
death
one
night
we
were
sitting
on
the
rug
in
front
of
the
fire
before
the
lamp
was
lighted
saying
what
would
we
do
an
indian
should
come
to
the
camp
sometime
and
try
to
scalp
us
and
just
when
we
were
so
scared
we
did
dare
look
around
behind
us
he
rolled
out
from
under
the
bed
where
he
been
hiding
and
grabbed
us
by
the
hair
with
the
awfullest
whoop
that
made
us
feel
as
if
we
been
dipped
in
why
we
did
stop
yelling
for
half
an
hour
norman
had
the
nightmare
that
night
we
never
did
find
out
how
joyce
punished
holland
but
what
she
did
to
him
was
plenty
for
he
has
scared
us
since
not
yet
though
you
never
know
when
he
going
to
joyce
is
afraid
of
anything
on
earth
you
ought
to
hear
about
the
way
she
played
ghost
once
when
she
was
in
france
and
she
just
talked
right
up
to
the
old
monsieur
who
owned
the
gate
of
the
giant
scissors
and
told
him
what
she
thought
of
him
how
old
is
this
joyce
asked
the
tall
young
fellow
whom
his
sister
called
phil
she
sounds
interesting
do
you
think
elsie
he
said
leaning
over
to
help
himself
to
a
handful
of
candy
elsie
nodded
with
a
smile
and
mary
hastened
to
give
the
desired
information
oh
she
fifteen
going
on
sixteen
and
she
interesting
she
can
paint
the
loveliest
pictures
you
ever
saw
she
was
going
to
be
an
artist
until
all
this
happened
and
she
had
to
leave
school
nobody
but
me
knows
how
bad
it
made
her
feel
to
do
that
i
found
her
crying
in
the
when
i
went
up
to
say
to
the
black
kitten
and
she
made
me
cross
my
heart
and
body
i
never
tell
so
mamma
thinks
that
she
does
mind
it
at
all
things
have
gone
wrong
at
our
house
ever
since
i
had
the
mumps
she
began
again
when
she
had
slowly
crunched
two
burnt
almonds
holland
sprained
his
wrist
and
mamma
nearly
died
with
pneumonia
and
norman
upset
the
on
the
stove
and
burnt
up
a
whole
week
ironing
and
after
that
jack
had
both
ears
frosted
in
a
blizzard
and
bob
our
darling
little
that
joyce
brought
from
kentucky
was
poisoned
that
a
list
of
misfortunes
exclaimed
phil
sympathetically
enough
to
discourage
anybody
oh
at
our
house
we
never
get
discouraged
to
answered
mary
of
course
we
feel
that
way
at
first
but
joyce
always
says
the
vicar
and
then
we
stiffen
the
vicar
echoed
phil
much
puzzled
yes
the
vicar
of
wakefield
you
know
do
you
remember
what
bad
luck
they
all
had
about
the
green
spectacles
and
everything
and
he
said
us
be
inflexible
and
fortune
will
at
last
change
in
our
favour
was
there
ever
anything
funnier
exclaimed
phil
in
an
aside
as
this
bit
of
wisdom
was
rolled
out
with
such
a
dramatic
toss
of
the
head
that
the
big
blue
bows
on
the
little
blond
braids
bobbed
wildly
the
idea
of
a
child
like
that
reading
the
of
wakefield
oh
i
did
read
him
myself
answered
mary
eager
to
be
entirely
truthful
joyce
read
it
aloud
to
all
the
family
last
winter
and
since
then
we
all
tried
to
do
as
the
vicar
did
be
inflexible
when
troubles
come
even
norman
knows
that
if
you
swallow
your
sobs
and
when
you
bump
your
head
or
anything
that
it
does
hurt
half
so
bad
as
when
you
just
let
loose
and
howl
jack
started
to
his
feet
when
he
heard
the
laugh
that
followed
sure
that
mary
was
saying
something
that
ought
to
be
left
unsaid
he
reached
her
just
in
time
to
hear
her
remark
we
going
to
eat
in
the
our
lunch
has
all
given
out
and
i
glad
of
it
for
i
never
did
eat
in
a
and
i
always
wanted
to
going
to
have
if
it
does
cost
too
much
jack
face
was
crimson
as
he
bent
down
and
whispered
in
mary
ear
and
it
grew
several
shades
redder
as
she
calmly
answered
aloud
no
i
want
to
go
out
on
the
platform
it
blowing
so
hard
i
get
my
eyes
full
of
sand
he
bent
again
to
whisper
this
time
savagely
and
then
turned
back
toward
the
other
car
not
waiting
for
her
answer
but
it
followed
him
shrilly
in
an
indignant
tone
it
no
such
a
thing
jack
ware
i
not
telling
all
i
know
a
few
minutes
later
a
boy
of
twelve
appeared
in
the
door
looking
up
and
down
the
car
with
keen
gray
eyes
the
moment
his
glance
fell
on
mary
he
started
down
the
aisle
toward
her
with
such
an
air
of
determination
that
she
started
up
in
dismay
oh
dear
she
exclaimed
there
holland
beckoning
for
me
now
got
to
go
why
should
you
go
for
him
rather
than
jack
asked
phil
he
nearly
so
big
you
do
know
holland
said
mary
taking
a
step
forward
he
mind
making
a
scene
anywhere
we
happen
to
be
if
he
was
told
to
bring
me
he
do
it
if
he
had
to
drag
me
down
the
aisle
by
my
hair
i
had
a
mighty
nice
time
and
i
much
obliged
for
the
candy
the
ware
family
were
already
seated
in
the
when
phil
and
elsie
went
in
to
dinner
a
little
later
mary
over
her
soup
was
giving
an
enthusiastic
account
of
her
new
acquaintances
they
going
to
their
grandfather
in
california
she
said
it
the
most
beautiful
place
you
ever
heard
of
with
goldfish
in
the
fountain
and
gold
of
ophir
roses
in
the
garden
and
dago
their
old
pet
monkey
is
there
they
had
to
send
him
away
from
home
because
he
got
into
so
much
mischief
and
miss
elsie
tremont
that
her
name
is
all
in
black
because
her
patricia
is
dead
her
aunt
patricia
kept
house
for
them
but
now
they
live
at
their
grandfather
phil
is
only
seventeen
but
he
six
feet
tall
and
looks
so
old
that
i
thought
maybe
he
was
thirty
gracious
mary
how
did
you
find
out
so
much
asked
joyce
with
a
warning
shake
of
the
head
at
norman
who
was
crumbling
his
bread
into
his
soup
oh
i
asked
him
if
he
was
married
and
he
laughed
and
said
he
was
only
seventeen
just
a
schoolboy
a
cadet
in
a
military
academy
out
in
california
there
they
are
now
she
added
excitedly
as
the
waiter
pulled
out
two
chairs
at
the
little
table
across
the
aisle
both
the
newcomers
smiled
at
mary
who
beamed
broadly
in
response
then
they
gave
a
quick
at
the
rest
of
the
family
what
a
woman
the
little
mother
is
said
elsie
in
a
low
tone
and
joyce
interesting
but
i
would
say
she
is
exactly
pretty
would
you
um
i
do
know
answered
phil
after
another
politely
careless
glance
in
her
direction
she
has
a
face
you
like
to
keep
looking
at
it
so
bright
and
pleasant
and
her
eyes
are
lovely
she
be
jolly
good
company
i
imagine
a
sort
of
a
always
doing
and
saying
unusual
things
in
the
same
casual
way
joyce
was
taking
note
of
them
she
felt
strongly
drawn
toward
the
pretty
girl
in
black
and
wished
that
they
were
going
to
the
same
place
so
that
she
might
make
her
acquaintance
once
when
they
were
all
laughing
at
something
norman
said
she
looked
up
and
caught
her
eye
and
they
both
smiled
then
phil
looked
across
with
such
an
understanding
gleam
of
humour
in
his
eyes
that
she
almost
smiled
at
him
but
checked
herself
and
looked
down
in
her
plate
remembering
that
the
handsome
cadet
was
a
stranger
the
train
stopped
at
a
junction
just
as
mary
finished
her
which
she
had
been
eating
as
slowly
as
possible
in
order
to
prolong
the
pleasure
finding
that
there
would
be
a
wait
of
nearly
half
an
hour
joyce
persuaded
her
mother
to
go
back
to
the
rear
platform
of
the
and
sit
out
awhile
in
the
fresh
air
although
the
sun
was
down
it
was
so
warm
that
ware
scarcely
needed
the
shawl
joyce
drew
around
her
shoulders
i
ca
believe
that
this
is
the
last
day
of
december
she
said
to
mary
as
joyce
hurried
into
the
station
to
make
some
inquiry
of
the
the
last
day
of
the
old
year
she
added
these
and
the
band
playing
over
there
in
the
park
and
all
the
passengers
promenading
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
station
bareheaded
make
it
seem
like
a
summer
resort
mary
peered
after
the
promenading
passengers
wistfully
the
boys
had
disappeared
to
watch
the
engine
take
water
and
there
was
no
one
for
her
to
walk
with
just
then
phil
and
elsie
tremont
sauntering
along
caught
sight
of
her
wistful
little
face
do
you
want
to
come
too
asked
elsie
pausing
you
sleep
better
for
a
little
exercise
oh
yes
was
the
delighted
reply
may
i
mamma
it
miss
elsie
tremont
that
i
told
you
about
that
ran
away
with
a
monkey
and
a
when
she
was
a
little
bit
of
a
girl
i
afraid
that
with
such
an
introduction
you
think
i
not
a
proper
person
to
trust
your
daughter
with
ware
said
elsie
laughing
but
i
assure
you
i
never
run
away
again
that
experience
quite
cured
me
probably
mary
has
given
you
just
as
alarming
an
impression
of
us
answered
ware
she
has
never
learned
to
regard
any
one
as
a
stranger
and
all
the
world
is
her
friend
to
confide
in
would
you
like
to
walk
a
little
while
too
asked
elsie
stirred
by
some
faint
memory
of
a
delicate
white
face
like
this
one
that
years
ago
used
to
smile
out
at
her
from
a
hammock
in
the
gold
of
ophir
rose
garden
she
was
only
five
years
old
the
last
time
she
saw
her
mother
but
the
dim
memory
was
a
very
sweet
one
yes
come
it
will
do
you
good
urged
phil
cordially
influenced
partly
by
the
same
memory
and
partly
by
the
thought
that
here
was
a
chance
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
joyce
as
well
according
to
her
little
sister
she
was
an
unusually
interesting
girl
and
the
glimpse
he
had
had
of
her
himself
confirmed
that
opinion
so
it
happened
to
joyce
great
astonishment
as
she
hurried
back
to
the
train
she
met
her
mother
walking
slowly
along
beside
elsie
phil
with
mary
chattering
to
him
like
an
amusing
little
magpie
was
just
behind
them
almost
before
she
knew
how
it
came
about
she
was
walking
with
them
listening
first
to
elsie
then
to
phil
as
they
told
of
the
she
was
going
back
to
in
california
and
the
military
academy
in
which
he
was
a
cadet
they
had
been
back
home
to
spend
the
christmas
vacation
with
their
father
whom
they
did
not
expect
to
see
again
for
a
long
time
he
was
a
physician
and
now
on
his
way
to
berlin
where
he
expected
to
spend
a
year
or
two
in
scientific
research
at
the
warning
call
of
all
aboard
they
hurried
back
to
the
car
just
as
the
boys
came
scrambling
up
the
steps
acquaintances
grow
almost
as
rapidly
on
these
long
overland
journeys
across
the
continent
as
they
do
on
shipboard
the
girls
regretted
the
fact
that
they
had
not
found
each
other
earlier
but
jack
and
phil
soon
made
up
for
lost
time
phil
who
had
hunted
wild
goats
among
the
rocks
of
catalina
island
and
jack
who
expected
unlimited
shooting
of
quail
and
ducks
at
lee
ranch
were
not
long
in
exchanging
invitations
for
future
hunting
together
if
either
should
happen
to
stray
into
the
other
vicinity
i
feel
as
if
i
had
known
you
always
said
elsie
to
joyce
as
they
separated
regretfully
at
bedtime
wondering
if
they
ever
would
meet
again
i
wish
you
were
going
to
the
with
me
i
wish
you
were
going
to
stop
in
arizona
answered
joyce
maybe
you
can
come
out
to
the
ranch
sometime
when
you
are
on
your
way
back
east
i
think
that
we
ought
to
all
sit
up
together
to
see
the
old
year
out
and
the
new
year
in
protested
mary
indignant
at
being
hurried
off
to
bed
at
seven
you
see
the
change
all
right
remarked
jack
and
you
have
a
chance
to
make
a
night
of
it
we
have
to
get
off
at
maricopa
a
little
after
midnight
and
there
no
telling
when
that
train
for
phoenix
will
come
along
they
say
it
always
behind
time
late
that
night
elsie
wakened
by
the
stopping
of
the
train
looked
at
her
watch
the
new
year
had
just
dawned
a
brakeman
went
through
the
car
with
a
lantern
there
were
strange
voices
outside
a
confusion
of
calls
and
the
curtains
of
her
berth
swayed
and
shook
as
a
number
of
people
hurried
down
the
aisle
laden
with
baggage
somebody
tripped
over
a
pair
of
shoes
left
too
far
out
in
the
aisle
and
somebody
muttered
a
complaint
about
always
being
wakened
at
maricopa
by
people
who
had
no
more
consideration
for
the
travelling
public
than
to
make
their
changes
in
the
dead
of
night
maricopa
she
thought
starting
up
on
her
elbow
that
is
where
the
wares
are
to
get
off
raising
the
she
peered
out
into
the
night
yes
there
they
were
just
going
into
the
station
jack
and
holland
weighted
down
with
baggage
joyce
helping
the
little
mother
with
one
hand
and
dragging
the
drowsy
norman
after
her
with
the
other
mary
sleepily
bringing
up
the
rear
with
her
hat
tipped
over
one
eye
and
her
tripping
her
at
every
step
bless
her
little
soul
she
the
funniest
fattest
little
chatterbox
of
a
girl
i
ever
saw
thought
elsie
as
she
watched
her
stumble
into
the
station
little
vicar
she
whispered
waving
her
hand
may
you
always
keep
inflexible
i
wonder
if
i
ever
see
any
of
them
again
i
wish
i
were
in
a
big
family
like
that
they
do
have
such
good
times
together
as
the
train
pulled
slowly
out
and
went
thundering
on
into
the
darkness
she
tried
to
go
to
sleep
again
but
for
a
long
time
whenever
she
closed
her
eyes
she
saw
the
little
house
in
kansas
that
mary
had
described
so
vividly
there
it
stood
empty
and
deserted
in
the
snow
with
the
pathetic
little
left
for
the
birds
and
far
away
the
family
who
loved
it
so
dearly
were
facing
blithely
and
bravely
the
untried
new
year
in
which
they
were
to
make
for
themselves
another
home
somewhere
out
on
the
lonely
desert
oh
i
do
hope
they
keep
was
elsie
last
waking
thought
i
do
hope
they
have
a
happy
new
year
chapter
ii
a
robinson
crusoe
of
the
desert
joyce
stood
in
the
door
of
the
little
adobe
house
and
looked
out
across
the
desert
with
tears
in
her
eyes
if
was
to
be
their
home
through
all
the
dreary
years
that
stretched
ahead
of
them
it
hardly
seemed
worth
while
to
go
on
living
jack
in
the
bare
unfurnished
room
behind
her
was
noisily
wielding
a
hatchet
opening
the
boxes
and
barrels
of
household
goods
which
had
followed
them
by
freight
he
did
not
know
which
one
held
his
gun
but
he
was
determined
to
find
it
before
the
sun
went
down
for
nearly
three
weeks
they
had
been
at
lee
ranch
half
a
mile
farther
down
the
road
waiting
for
the
goods
to
come
and
to
find
a
place
where
they
could
set
up
a
home
of
their
own
boarding
for
a
family
of
six
was
far
too
expensive
to
be
afforded
long
now
the
boxes
had
arrived
and
they
had
found
a
place
the
only
one
for
rent
anywhere
near
the
ranch
joyce
felt
sick
at
heart
as
she
looked
around
her
here
it
is
at
last
called
jack
triumphantly
dropping
the
hatchet
and
throwing
pillows
and
bedding
out
of
the
box
in
reckless
haste
to
reach
his
most
cherished
possession
the
fine
hammerless
shotgun
which
link
had
given
him
christmas
he
had
intended
to
carry
it
with
him
on
the
journey
in
its
carved
leather
case
but
in
the
confusion
of
the
hurried
packing
some
neighbour
had
nailed
it
up
in
one
of
the
boxes
while
he
was
absent
and
there
had
been
no
time
to
rescue
it
he
had
worried
about
it
ever
since
oh
you
beauty
he
exclaimed
rubbing
his
hand
along
the
polished
stock
as
he
drew
it
from
the
case
sitting
on
the
floor
he
began
whistling
cheerfully
as
he
fitted
the
parts
together
joyce
he
called
peering
down
the
barrels
to
see
if
any
speck
of
rust
had
gathered
in
them
do
you
suppose
we
brought
any
with
us
i
uncrate
the
if
you
think
that
the
can
is
likely
to
be
in
one
of
the
drawers
i
do
know
answered
joyce
in
such
a
hopeless
tone
that
jack
lowered
his
and
stared
at
her
in
astonishment
her
back
was
toward
him
but
her
voice
certainly
sounded
choked
with
tears
it
was
so
unusual
for
joyce
to
cry
that
he
felt
that
something
very
serious
must
be
the
cause
what
the
matter
sister
he
inquired
you
are
sick
are
you
yes
she
exclaimed
with
a
sob
turning
and
throwing
herself
down
on
the
pile
of
pillows
he
had
just
unpacked
i
sick
of
everything
in
this
awful
country
i
sick
of
the
desert
and
of
seeing
nothing
but
invalids
and
sand
and
cactus
and
wherever
i
go
and
sick
of
the
prospect
of
living
in
this
little
hole
of
a
and
working
like
a
squaw
and
never
doing
anything
or
being
anything
worth
while
if
i
thought
i
had
to
go
on
all
my
life
this
way
i
want
to
die
right
now
jack
viewed
her
uneasily
goodness
joyce
i
never
knew
you
to
go
all
to
pieces
this
way
before
you
always
been
the
one
to
preach
to
us
when
things
went
wrong
that
if
we
be
inflexible
that
fortune
would
at
last
change
in
our
favour
inflexible
fiddlesticks
stormed
joyce
from
the
depths
of
a
bolster
where
she
had
hidden
her
face
i
been
holding
out
against
fate
so
long
that
i
ca
do
it
any
more
and
i
going
to
give
up
right
here
and
now
then
i
do
know
what
will
become
of
the
rest
of
us
answered
jack
raising
his
empty
gun
to
aim
at
a
in
the
outside
the
door
it
you
that
has
always
kept
things
cheerful
when
we
were
down
in
the
mouth
joyce
sat
up
and
wiped
her
eyes
i
think
that
it
must
be
that
old
mountain
out
there
that
makes
me
feel
so
hopeless
it
is
so
depressing
to
see
it
kneeling
there
in
the
sand
day
after
day
like
a
poor
old
beast
of
burden
unable
to
move
another
step
it
is
just
like
us
fate
is
too
much
for
it
jack
glance
followed
hers
through
the
open
door
straight
and
level
the
desert
stretched
away
toward
the
horizon
where
a
circle
of
mountains
seemed
to
rise
abruptly
from
the
sands
and
shut
them
in
there
was
squaw
peak
on
the
left
cold
and
steely
blue
and
over
on
the
right
the
bare
buttes
like
mounds
of
red
ore
and
just
in
front
was
the
mountain
they
must
face
every
time
they
looked
from
the
door
some
strange
freak
of
nature
had
given
it
the
form
of
a
giant
camel
five
miles
long
there
it
knelt
in
the
sand
with
patient
outstretched
neck
and
such
an
appearance
of
hopeless
resignation
to
its
lot
that
joyce
was
not
the
only
one
who
found
it
depressing
more
than
one
invalid
sent
to
the
surrounding
ranches
for
the
atmosphere
of
arizona
had
turned
his
back
on
it
with
a
shiver
of
premonition
saying
it
just
like
me
and
left
to
die
on
the
desert
neither
of
us
will
ever
get
away
it
made
no
difference
to
jack
what
shape
the
mountains
took
he
could
not
understand
joyce
sensitiveness
to
her
surroundings
but
it
made
him
uncomfortable
to
see
her
so
despondent
he
sat
hugging
his
gun
in
silence
a
moment
not
knowing
how
to
answer
her
and
then
began
idly
aiming
it
first
in
one
direction
then
another
presently
his
glance
happened
to
rest
upon
a
battered
book
that
had
fallen
from
one
of
the
boxes
he
drew
it
toward
him
with
his
foot
it
was
open
at
a
familiar
picture
and
on
the
opposite
page
was
a
paragraph
which
he
had
read
so
many
times
that
he
could
almost
repeat
it
from
memory
hello
he
exclaimed
here
an
old
friend
who
was
in
as
bad
a
fix
as
we
are
joyce
and
he
lived
through
it
leaning
over
without
picking
up
the
book
from
the
floor
he
began
reading
from
the
page
printed
in
the
large
type
of
a
i
poor
miserable
robinson
crusoe
being
shipwrecked
during
a
dreadful
storm
in
the
offing
came
on
shore
this
dismal
unfortunate
island
which
i
called
the
island
of
despair
all
the
rest
of
the
ship
company
being
drowned
and
myself
almost
dead
all
the
rest
of
the
day
i
spent
in
afflicting
myself
at
the
dismal
circumstances
i
was
brought
to
i
had
neither
house
clothes
weapons
nor
place
to
fly
to
and
in
despair
of
any
relief
saw
nothing
but
death
before
me
either
that
i
should
be
devoured
by
wild
beasts
murdered
by
savages
or
starved
to
death
for
want
of
food
a
long
pause
followed
then
joyce
sat
up
looking
teased
and
held
out
her
hand
for
the
book
i
do
mind
old
crusoe
preaching
me
a
sermon
she
said
as
she
turned
the
tattered
leaves
now
he
done
it
i
quit
myself
at
the
dismal
circumstances
i
was
brought
to
i
wished
a
thousand
times
when
i
was
smaller
that
i
could
have
been
in
his
place
and
had
all
his
interesting
adventures
and
to
think
here
we
are
at
last
in
almost
as
bad
a
plight
as
he
was
only
we
have
a
weapon
she
added
with
a
mischievous
glance
at
the
gun
jack
was
holding
and
that
means
food
too
he
answered
proudly
for
i
expect
to
kill
many
a
quail
and
duck
with
this
oh
we
better
off
than
crusoe
in
a
thousand
ways
i
suppose
if
only
stop
to
count
our
blessings
she
answered
now
ready
to
take
a
more
cheerful
view
of
life
since
she
had
had
her
little
outburst
of
rebellion
he
did
have
a
chinaman
driving
by
with
fresh
vegetables
twice
a
week
as
we
will
have
and
we
have
clothes
and
a
house
such
as
it
is
and
a
place
to
fly
to
for
lee
ranch
will
always
be
open
to
us
if
we
need
a
refuge
so
we
can
start
at
the
place
where
crusoe
was
when
he
really
began
to
enjoy
his
island
of
despair
said
jack
shall
i
go
on
unpacking
these
things
i
stopped
when
you
announced
that
you
were
going
to
give
up
and
die
for
i
thought
there
would
be
any
use
trying
to
do
anything
with
you
in
the
dumps
like
that
joyce
looked
around
the
dingy
room
it
not
worth
while
to
unpack
till
the
place
has
been
scrubbed
from
top
to
bottom
if
we
going
to
make
a
home
of
it
we
have
to
begin
right
the
landlord
wo
do
anything
and
we
could
hardly
expect
him
to
considering
the
small
amount
of
rent
we
pay
but
i
do
see
how
we
can
live
in
it
without
fresh
paper
and
paint
i
wish
we
find
a
ship
cast
up
on
the
sands
of
the
desert
said
jack
that
would
have
all
sorts
of
supplies
and
tools
in
it
the
shipwrecks
helped
old
robinson
out
amazingly
i
make
a
bookcase
if
we
did
and
put
up
shelves
and
all
sorts
of
things
this
would
be
a
fine
place
to
show
what
i
learned
in
the
manual
we
need
benches
and
rustic
seats
out
under
those
we
have
to
buy
some
tools
said
joyce
let
make
out
a
list
of
things
we
need
and
go
to
town
early
in
the
morning
lee
said
we
could
borrow
bogus
and
the
surrey
all
right
assented
jack
ready
for
anything
that
promised
change
and
she
exclaimed
after
a
long
slow
survey
of
the
room
let
paint
and
paper
this
place
ourselves
i
sure
we
can
do
it
there
a
tape
measure
in
one
of
the
machine
drawers
suppose
you
get
it
out
and
measure
the
room
so
we
know
how
much
paper
to
buy
joyce
was
her
old
brave
cheery
self
again
now
giving
orders
like
a
and
throwing
herself
into
the
work
at
hand
with
contagious
enthusiasm
with
the
stub
of
a
pencil
jack
found
in
his
pocket
she
began
making
a
memorandum
on
the
of
robinson
crusoe
paint
turpentine
brushes
screws
nails
saw
mop
broom
soap
she
wrote
rapidly
and
a
hatchet
added
jack
this
one
belongs
to
the
mexican
at
the
ranch
and
oh
yes
an
axe
he
says
that
holland
and
i
can
get
all
the
wood
we
need
right
here
on
the
desert
without
its
costing
us
a
cent
if
we
willing
to
chop
it
mesquite
roots
you
know
and
greasewood
it
fortunate
we
can
get
something
without
paying
for
it
commented
joyce
as
she
added
an
axe
to
the
list
then
she
sat
studying
the
possibilities
of
the
room
while
jack
knocked
the
crate
from
the
machine
found
the
tape
measure
and
did
a
sum
in
arithmetic
to
find
the
amount
of
paper
it
would
take
to
cover
the
walls
i
can
see
just
how
it
is
going
to
look
when
we
are
all
through
she
said
presently
when
this
old
dark
woodwork
is
painted
white
and
these
dismal
walls
are
covered
with
fresh
light
paper
and
there
are
clean
airy
curtains
at
the
windows
it
wo
seem
like
the
same
place
mamma
must
see
it
till
it
is
all
in
order
exhausted
by
the
journey
ware
had
been
too
weak
to
worry
over
their
future
or
even
to
wonder
what
would
become
of
them
and
had
handed
over
the
little
to
joyce
make
it
go
just
as
far
as
it
will
dear
she
said
you
are
too
young
to
have
such
a
load
laid
on
your
shoulders
but
i
see
no
other
way
now
joyce
had
taken
up
the
burden
of
responsibility
so
bravely
that
no
one
but
jack
knew
of
her
moments
of
discouragement
and
he
was
forgetting
her
recent
tears
in
her
present
enthusiasm
oh
i
wish
it
was
she
exclaimed
and
we
had
all
our
supplies
bought
so
that
we
could
begin
so
do
i
answered
jack
but
it
nearly
sundown
now
and
the
will
be
ringing
before
we
get
back
to
the
ranch
if
we
start
soon
well
lock
the
doors
and
we
go
said
joyce
beginning
to
pin
on
her
hat
oh
what
the
use
of
being
so
particular
lee
says
everybody
is
honest
out
in
this
country
they
never
turn
a
key
on
the
ranch
and
they
never
had
anything
taken
either
by
mexicans
or
indians
in
all
the
years
they
lived
here
it
is
half
as
wild
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
i
wish
i
could
have
been
a
pioneer
and
had
some
of
the
exciting
times
they
had
nevertheless
jack
barred
the
back
door
and
locked
the
front
one
before
following
joyce
across
the
yard
and
over
the
little
bridge
spanning
the
irrigating
canal
into
the
public
road
they
stood
there
a
moment
looking
back
at
the
house
just
one
big
square
adobe
room
with
a
in
the
rear
around
three
sides
of
it
ran
a
rough
sort
of
porch
or
shack
built
of
cottonwood
posts
supporting
a
thatch
of
and
while
it
would
afford
a
fine
shelter
from
the
sun
in
the
tropical
summer
awaiting
them
it
was
a
homely
affair
almost
as
rough
in
its
appearance
as
if
robinson
crusoe
himself
had
built
it
it
hopeless
is
it
said
joyce
with
a
despairing
shake
of
the
head
no
matter
how
homelike
we
may
make
it
inside
it
will
always
be
the
picture
of
desolation
outside
not
when
the
leaves
come
out
on
that
row
of
answered
jack
lee
says
they
will
be
so
green
and
bushy
that
they
will
almost
hide
the
house
and
the
blossoms
on
them
in
the
spring
are
as
purple
and
sweet
as
lilacs
then
this
row
of
along
the
road
and
the
clump
of
cottonwoods
back
of
the
house
and
those
two
big
by
the
gate
will
make
it
cool
and
shady
here
no
matter
how
scorching
hot
the
desert
may
be
we
have
to
give
them
lots
of
water
oh
that
reminds
me
i
have
to
have
a
pair
of
rubber
boots
if
i
am
to
do
the
irrigating
the
water
will
be
in
again
day
after
joyce
groaned
as
she
opened
the
book
she
was
carrying
and
added
boots
to
the
long
list
on
the
what
a
lot
it
going
to
take
to
get
us
started
crusoe
certainly
had
reason
to
be
thankful
for
the
shipwrecked
stores
he
found
but
it
cost
less
to
get
the
boots
than
to
hire
a
mexican
every
eight
days
to
do
the
irrigating
said
jack
following
the
road
beside
the
canal
they
walked
along
in
the
last
rays
of
the
sunset
toward
the
ranch
birds
twittered
now
and
then
in
the
on
their
right
or
a
string
of
cows
went
lowing
homeward
through
the
green
alfalfa
pastures
to
the
milking
the
road
and
canal
seemed
to
run
between
two
worlds
for
on
the
left
it
was
all
a
dreary
desert
the
barren
sands
stretching
away
toward
the
red
buttes
and
old
camelback
mountain
as
wild
and
cheerless
as
when
the
indians
held
possession
some
day
it
too
would
rejoice
and
blossom
like
the
rose
but
not
until
a
network
of
waterways
dug
across
it
brought
it
new
life
once
as
they
walked
along
a
crossed
their
path
and
went
bounding
away
in
a
fright
a
covey
of
quail
rose
with
a
loud
whirr
of
wings
from
a
clump
of
bushes
beside
the
road
but
they
met
no
human
being
until
holland
and
mary
just
from
school
came
racing
out
from
the
ranch
to
meet
them
with
eager
questions
about
the
new
home
chris
the
mexican
had
made
the
round
of
the
tents
building
a
little
fire
of
mesquite
wood
in
each
tiny
drum
stove
for
in
february
the
air
of
the
desert
grows
icy
as
soon
as
the
sun
disappears
ware
was
sitting
in
a
between
the
stove
and
table
on
which
stood
a
lamp
with
a
yellow
shade
sending
a
cheerful
glow
all
over
the
tent
joyce
took
the
remaining
chair
jack
sat
on
the
and
mary
norman
and
holland
piled
upon
the
bed
to
take
part
in
the
family
conclave
the
canvas
curtain
had
been
dropped
over
the
and
the
bright
indian
rugs
on
the
floor
gave
a
touch
of
warmth
and
cosiness
to
the
tent
that
made
it
seem
wonderfully
bright
and
homelike
i
do
see
said
mary
when
she
had
listened
to
a
description
of
the
place
how
we
are
all
going
to
eat
and
sleep
and
live
in
one
room
and
a
kitchen
it
takes
three
tents
to
hold
us
all
here
besides
having
the
ranch
to
eat
in
what
if
eugenia
forbes
should
come
from
the
to
visit
us
or
the
little
colonel
or
some
of
the
other
girls
from
kentucky
that
you
knew
at
the
joyce
where
would
they
sleep
yes
chimed
in
holland
teasingly
or
the
queen
of
sheba
suppose
should
come
with
all
her
train
it
about
as
likely
we
would
have
to
play
wants
a
corner
all
night
mary
and
whoever
happened
to
be
would
have
to
sit
up
until
he
happened
to
find
somebody
out
of
his
corner
goosey
exclaimed
mary
sticking
out
her
tongue
at
him
and
making
the
worst
face
she
could
screw
up
honestly
what
would
we
do
joyce
we
not
going
to
try
to
live
in
just
one
room
explained
joyce
the
doctor
said
mamma
ought
to
sleep
in
a
tent
so
we
get
a
big
double
one
like
this
wainscoted
up
high
with
floor
and
just
like
this
mamma
and
you
and
i
can
use
that
and
the
boys
will
have
just
an
ordinary
without
door
or
floor
they
have
been
so
wild
to
be
pioneers
that
they
will
be
glad
to
come
as
near
to
it
as
possible
and
that
means
living
without
extra
comforts
and
conveniences
in
the
house
one
corner
of
the
room
will
be
the
library
where
we
put
desk
and
one
corner
will
be
the
where
we
have
the
machine
and
one
will
be
a
cosy
corner
with
the
big
lounge
and
lots
of
pillows
if
the
queen
of
sheba
or
the
little
colonel
should
do
such
an
improbable
thing
as
to
stray
out
here
we
have
a
place
for
them
there
goes
the
cried
norman
scrambling
down
from
the
bed
in
hot
haste
to
beat
mary
to
the
table
joyce
waited
to
turn
down
the
lamp
close
the
stove
draughts
and
bring
her
mother
shawl
before
following
them
how
bright
the
camp
looks
with
a
light
in
every
tent
she
said
as
they
stepped
out
under
the
stars
they
look
like
the
transparencies
in
the
torchlight
processions
that
we
used
to
have
back
in
plainsville
ware
tent
was
in
the
front
row
so
it
was
only
a
step
to
the
door
of
the
in
the
ranch
house
the
long
table
was
nearly
filled
when
they
took
their
seats
gathered
around
it
were
people
who
had
drifted
there
from
all
parts
of
the
world
in
search
of
lost
health
a
boston
a
wyoming
cowboy
a
canadian
minister
a
scotchman
from
inverness
and
a
jolly
irish
lad
from
belfast
were
among
the
number
the
most
interesting
one
to
joyce
was
an
old
norwegian
who
sat
opposite
her
by
the
name
of
jan
ellestad
not
old
in
years
for
his
hair
was
still
untouched
by
gray
and
his
dark
eyes
flashed
at
times
with
the
spirit
of
the
old
vikings
when
he
told
the
of
his
fatherland
but
he
was
old
in
sad
experiences
and
broken
health
and
broken
hopes
the
faint
trace
of
a
foreign
accent
that
clung
to
his
speech
made
everything
he
said
seem
interesting
to
joyce
and
after
lee
had
told
her
something
of
his
history
she
looked
upon
him
as
a
hero
this
was
the
third
winter
he
had
come
back
to
the
ranch
he
knew
he
could
not
live
through
another
year
and
he
had
stopped
making
plans
for
himself
but
he
listened
with
unfailing
cheerfulness
to
other
people
now
he
looked
up
expectantly
as
joyce
took
her
seat
i
can
see
by
your
face
miss
joyce
he
said
in
his
slow
hesitating
way
as
if
groping
for
the
right
words
that
you
are
about
to
plunge
this
ranch
into
another
wild
excitement
what
is
it
now
please
guess
said
joyce
glancing
around
the
table
everybody
can
have
one
guess
during
the
three
weeks
that
the
wares
had
been
on
the
ranch
they
had
made
many
friends
among
the
boarders
most
of
them
could
do
little
but
sit
in
the
sun
and
wait
for
the
winter
to
creep
by
so
they
welcomed
anything
that
relieved
the
monotony
of
the
long
idle
days
unexpected
remarks
gave
fresh
zest
to
the
conversation
the
boys
bubbling
over
with
energy
and
high
spirits
were
a
constant
source
of
entertainment
and
joyce
enthusiasms
were
contagious
she
was
constantly
coming
in
from
the
desert
with
some
strange
discovery
to
arouse
the
interest
of
the
listless
little
company
now
as
her
challenge
passed
around
the
table
any
one
hearing
her
laugh
at
the
amusing
replies
would
not
have
dreamed
that
only
a
few
hours
before
she
was
sobbing
to
jack
that
she
was
sick
of
seeing
nothing
but
invalids
and
sand
and
cactus
we
have
any
name
for
our
new
home
she
announced
and
i
thinking
of
having
a
name
contest
any
one
can
offer
an
unlimited
number
and
the
best
shall
receive
a
prize
then
i
win
responded
the
scotchman
promptly
there
nae
mair
appropriate
name
for
a
wee
bit
like
that
than
that
is
pretty
said
joyce
repeating
it
thoughtfully
i
love
the
old
song
by
that
name
but
i
afraid
that
it
is
exactly
appropriate
you
see
we
may
have
to
bide
there
for
years
and
years
instead
of
just
a
wee
give
it
a
spanish
name
said
the
minister
alamo
means
cottonwood
and
you
have
a
group
of
cottonwoods
there
that
would
be
just
as
good
as
naming
it
the
pines
or
the
oaks
or
the
beeches
no
call
it
something
indian
said
the
cowboy
something
that
means
yet
has
a
swing
to
the
syllables
wait
till
we
get
through
fixing
it
interrupted
jack
it
look
so
fine
that
you
wo
dare
call
it
going
to
paint
and
paper
it
ourselves
not
you
two
children
exclaimed
the
norwegian
in
surprise
with
our
own
lily
fingers
answered
joyce
then
you
have
an
interested
audience
he
answered
you
find
all
of
us
who
are
able
to
walk
perching
in
the
outside
your
door
every
morning
waiting
for
the
performance
to
begin
whoever
perches
there
will
have
to
descend
and
help
wo
they
jack
said
joyce
saucily
oh
mamma
whispered
mary
is
ellestad
really
going
to
climb
up
in
the
and
watch
them
let
me
stay
home
from
school
and
help
i
know
i
ca
study
if
i
go
for
i
be
thinking
of
all
the
fun
i
missing
chapter
iii
a
day
at
school
it
was
with
a
most
unwilling
mind
and
an
unhappy
heart
that
mary
began
her
third
week
at
school
in
the
first
place
she
could
not
bear
to
tear
herself
away
from
all
that
was
going
on
at
the
new
house
she
wanted
to
have
a
hand
in
the
dear
delights
of
she
wanted
to
poke
the
and
dabble
in
the
paste
and
watch
the
walls
grow
fresh
and
clean
as
the
paper
spread
over
the
old
patches
the
smell
of
the
fresh
paint
drew
her
and
gave
her
a
feeling
that
there
were
all
sorts
of
delightful
possibilities
in
this
region
yet
unexplored
in
the
second
place
life
in
the
new
school
was
a
grievous
burden
because
the
boys
seeing
how
easily
she
was
teased
found
their
chief
pleasure
in
annoying
her
she
was
a
trusting
little
soul
ready
to
nibble
the
bait
that
any
trap
offered
never
mind
you
get
used
to
it
after
awhile
her
mother
said
consolingly
each
evening
when
she
came
home
with
a
list
of
fresh
woes
you
tired
now
from
that
long
walk
home
things
will
seem
better
after
supper
and
joyce
would
add
do
look
so
doleful
mother
bunch
just
remember
the
vicar
and
keep
inflexible
fortune
is
bound
to
change
in
your
favour
after
awhile
but
the
third
friday
found
her
as
unhappy
as
the
third
monday
there
were
two
rooms
in
the
school
building
one
containing
all
the
primary
classes
the
other
the
grammar
grades
where
holland
found
a
place
mary
had
one
of
the
back
seats
in
the
primary
department
and
one
of
the
highest
hooks
in
the
on
which
to
hang
her
belongings
but
this
friday
morning
she
did
not
leave
her
in
either
place
she
and
patty
ritter
the
little
girl
who
sat
across
the
aisle
from
her
had
had
an
the
day
before
and
agreed
to
hide
their
baskets
in
a
hedgerow
so
that
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
wig
smith
finding
them
salt
on
one
jelly
cake
and
pepper
in
two
days
in
succession
is
a
little
too
much
to
be
borne
calmly
wig
smith
fondness
for
seasoning
other
people
lunches
was
only
one
of
his
many
obnoxious
traits
there
said
mary
scanning
the
horizon
anxiously
to
see
that
no
prowling
boy
was
in
sight
nobody
would
think
of
looking
behind
that
prickly
cactus
for
a
we
sure
of
not
going
hungry
with
their
arms
around
each
other
they
strolled
back
to
the
schoolhouse
taking
a
roundabout
way
with
great
cunning
to
throw
wig
smith
off
the
track
in
case
he
should
be
watching
but
their
precautions
were
needless
this
time
wig
had
set
up
a
establishment
on
the
steps
of
the
stile
his
stock
in
trade
being
a
and
a
hat
full
of
raw
turnips
nothing
could
have
been
friendlier
than
the
way
he
greeted
mary
and
patty
insisting
that
they
each
needed
a
set
of
false
teeth
half
a
dozen
of
his
friends
had
already
been
fitted
out
and
stood
around
grinning
in
order
to
show
the
big
white
turnip
teeth
he
had
fitted
over
the
set
provided
by
nature
as
the
teeth
were
cut
in
irregular
shapes
wide
ones
alternating
with
long
pointed
fangs
and
the
upper
lip
had
to
be
drawn
tightly
to
hold
them
in
place
the
effect
was
so
comical
that
they
could
hardly
hold
the
new
sets
in
position
for
laughing
at
each
other
in
payment
for
his
work
wig
accepted
almost
anything
that
his
customers
had
to
offer
marbles
when
he
could
get
them
pencils
apples
even
a
roll
of
saved
from
many
packages
which
was
all
one
girl
had
to
trade
a
search
through
mary
orderly
failed
to
show
anything
that
he
wanted
of
hers
but
the
neatly
prepared
home
lesson
which
fluttered
out
of
her
arithmetic
caught
his
eye
he
agreed
to
make
her
the
teeth
for
a
copy
of
six
problems
which
he
could
not
solve
mary
had
much
the
hardest
part
of
the
bargain
for
sitting
on
the
stile
she
patiently
copied
sums
until
the
second
bell
rang
while
he
turned
off
the
teeth
with
a
few
masterful
strokes
of
his
knife
let
all
put
them
in
as
soon
as
we
done
singing
and
wear
them
till
we
recite
spelling
he
suggested
it
mighty
hard
to
keep
from
chawin
on
after
they
been
in
your
mouth
awhile
let
see
who
can
keep
them
in
longest
every
five
minutes
by
the
clock
if
the
teacher
is
lookin
we
all
grin
at
onct
to
show
that
they
still
in
needless
to
say
the
usual
friday
morning
studiousness
did
not
prevail
in
the
primary
room
that
morning
too
many
eyes
were
watching
the
clock
for
the
moment
of
display
to
arrive
and
when
it
did
arrive
the
coughing
and
choking
that
was
set
up
to
hide
the
titters
plainly
told
the
teacher
that
some
mischief
was
afoot
if
she
could
have
turned
in
time
to
see
the
distorted
faces
she
must
have
laughed
too
it
was
such
a
comical
sight
but
she
was
trying
to
explain
to
a
row
of
stupid
little
mathematicians
the
mysteries
of
borrowing
in
subtraction
and
always
looked
up
a
moment
too
late
mary
ware
having
written
every
word
of
her
spelling
lesson
from
memory
and
compared
it
with
her
book
to
be
sure
that
she
knew
it
now
had
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
leisure
this
she
devoted
to
putting
her
desk
in
order
the
books
were
dusted
and
piled
in
neat
rows
everything
in
her
was
examined
and
laid
back
with
care
the
folded
and
tucked
under
the
moist
sponge
there
was
another
box
in
her
desk
it
had
bunches
of
violets
on
it
and
strips
of
lining
the
sides
it
smelled
faintly
of
the
violet
soap
it
had
once
held
she
kept
several
conveniences
in
this
pins
and
an
extra
in
case
of
loss
a
comb
and
a
little
round
mirror
with
a
celluloid
back
on
which
was
printed
the
advertisement
of
a
plainsville
druggist
as
she
polished
the
little
mirror
the
temptation
to
use
it
was
too
great
to
resist
holding
it
under
the
desk
she
stretched
her
lips
back
as
far
as
possible
in
a
grotesque
grin
to
show
her
set
of
turnip
teeth
they
looked
so
funny
that
she
tried
it
again
with
variations
rolling
her
eyes
and
wrinkling
her
nose
so
absorbed
was
she
that
she
did
not
realize
that
a
silence
had
fallen
in
the
room
that
the
recitation
had
stopped
and
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
her
then
her
own
name
spoken
in
a
stern
tone
startled
her
so
that
she
bounced
in
her
seat
and
dropped
the
mirror
why
i
come
here
blushing
and
embarrassed
at
being
called
into
public
notice
mary
stumbled
up
to
the
platform
and
submitted
to
an
examination
of
her
mouth
then
following
orders
she
went
to
the
door
and
with
much
sputtering
spat
the
teeth
out
into
the
yard
i
see
you
about
this
after
school
remarked
the
teacher
sternly
as
she
stumbled
back
to
her
seat
overcome
by
mortification
if
the
teacher
had
not
been
so
busy
watching
mary
obey
orders
she
would
have
noticed
a
rapid
moving
of
many
jaws
along
the
back
row
of
seats
and
a
mighty
gulping
and
swallowing
as
the
other
sets
of
teeth
disappeared
down
the
throats
of
their
owners
so
this
has
been
the
cause
of
so
much
disturbance
this
morning
she
remarked
crossly
i
astonished
that
one
of
the
quietest
pupils
in
the
school
should
have
behaved
in
such
a
manner
then
as
a
precaution
she
added
is
there
any
one
else
in
the
room
who
has
any
of
these
turnip
teeth
raise
your
hands
if
you
have
not
a
hand
went
up
and
every
face
met
mary
indignant
accusing
gaze
with
such
an
innocent
stare
that
she
cried
out
oh
what
a
story
open
your
mouths
commanded
the
teacher
turn
your
pockets
wrong
side
out
to
mary
amazement
nobody
had
so
much
as
a
taste
of
turnip
to
show
and
she
stood
accused
of
being
the
only
offender
the
only
one
with
judgment
awaiting
her
after
school
with
her
head
on
her
desk
and
her
face
hidden
on
her
arms
she
cried
softly
all
through
the
spelling
recitation
it
was
fair
she
sobbed
to
herself
patty
comforted
her
at
recess
with
half
her
stick
of
licorice
and
several
of
the
other
girls
crowded
around
her
begging
her
to
come
and
play
bird
and
not
to
mind
what
the
boys
said
and
not
to
look
around
when
wig
smith
mimicked
the
teacher
manner
and
called
after
her
in
a
tantalizing
tone
why
mary
ware
i
gradually
they
won
her
away
from
her
tears
and
before
recess
was
over
she
was
shrieking
with
the
gayest
of
them
as
they
raced
around
the
schoolhouse
to
escape
the
girl
who
being
it
personated
the
bad
man
as
they
dropped
into
their
seats
at
the
close
of
recess
hot
and
panting
a
boy
from
the
grammar
room
came
in
and
spoke
to
the
teacher
it
was
paul
archer
a
boy
from
new
york
whose
father
had
recently
bought
a
ranch
near
by
he
held
up
a
string
of
amber
beads
as
the
teacher
asked
does
this
belong
to
any
one
in
this
room
they
were
beautiful
beads
mary
caught
her
breath
as
she
looked
at
them
like
drops
of
rain
strung
on
a
sunbeam
she
thought
watching
them
sparkle
as
he
turned
and
twisted
the
string
paul
was
a
big
boy
very
clean
and
very
and
as
little
blanche
ellert
came
up
to
claim
her
necklace
blushing
and
shaking
back
her
curls
he
held
it
out
with
such
a
polite
bow
that
mary
romantic
little
soul
was
greatly
impressed
she
wished
that
the
beautiful
beads
had
been
hers
and
that
she
had
lost
them
and
could
have
claimed
them
before
the
whole
school
and
had
them
surrendered
to
her
in
that
princely
way
she
would
like
to
lose
a
ring
she
thought
that
is
if
she
had
one
or
a
locket
and
have
paul
find
it
and
give
it
to
her
before
the
whole
school
then
she
remembered
that
she
had
worn
her
best
jacket
to
school
that
morning
and
in
the
pocket
was
a
handkerchief
that
had
been
hung
on
the
for
her
in
plainsville
it
was
a
little
white
silk
one
embroidered
in
the
corners
with
sprays
of
blue
with
tiny
pink
buds
what
if
she
should
lose
that
and
paul
should
find
it
and
hold
up
the
pretty
thing
in
sight
of
all
the
school
for
her
to
claim
as
the
morning
wore
on
the
thought
pleased
her
more
and
more
the
primary
grades
were
dismissed
first
at
noon
so
she
had
time
to
slip
the
handkerchief
from
her
tiptoe
guiltily
into
the
other
and
drop
it
under
a
certain
felt
hat
which
hung
on
its
peg
with
a
jauntier
grace
than
the
other
caps
and
sombreros
could
boast
it
seemed
to
stare
at
her
in
surprise
by
her
own
daring
she
tiptoed
out
again
and
ran
after
patty
who
was
hunting
for
her
outside
there
wo
be
any
salt
in
our
cake
and
pepper
in
our
pie
patty
said
confidently
as
they
strolled
off
together
with
their
arms
around
each
other
let
get
our
baskets
and
go
away
off
out
of
sight
to
eat
our
dinners
i
know
the
nicest
place
down
by
the
lateral
under
some
the
water
is
running
it
be
like
having
a
picnic
beside
a
babbling
brook
assented
mary
i
love
to
hear
the
water
gurgle
through
the
seated
on
a
freshly
hewn
log
after
a
careful
survey
had
convinced
them
that
no
lizards
gila
monsters
or
horned
toads
lurked
underneath
the
little
girls
opened
their
baskets
and
shook
out
their
napkins
the
next
instant
a
wail
rose
from
them
in
unison
ants
nasty
little
black
ants
they
over
everything
just
look
at
my
chicken
sandwiches
mourned
mary
and
all
that
lovely
gingerbread
they
walking
all
over
it
and
through
it
and
into
it
and
around
it
there
is
a
spot
that
they
have
touched
and
my
mince
turnovers
cried
patty
i
brought
one
for
you
too
and
a
devilled
egg
but
there
is
a
thing
in
my
basket
that
fit
to
eat
nor
mine
either
said
mary
except
the
apples
we
might
wash
them
in
the
lateral
and
i
nearly
starved
i
so
hungry
grumbled
patty
an
better
than
nothing
but
it
does
go
very
far
it
no
use
to
go
and
ask
holland
for
any
of
his
lunch
said
mary
by
this
time
he
gobbled
up
even
the
scraps
and
busted
the
bag
he
always
brings
his
in
a
paper
bag
so
there
be
no
basket
to
carry
home
cautiously
leaning
over
the
bank
of
the
lateral
mary
began
dabbling
her
apple
back
and
forth
in
the
water
and
patty
kneeling
beside
her
followed
her
example
suddenly
patty
apple
slipped
out
of
her
hand
and
she
clutched
frantically
at
mary
arm
in
her
effort
to
save
it
and
at
the
same
time
keep
her
balance
both
swayed
and
fell
sideways
arm
plunged
into
the
water
wetting
her
sleeve
nearly
to
her
shoulder
but
clawing
at
the
earth
and
long
grass
with
the
other
hand
she
managed
after
much
scrambling
to
regain
her
position
patty
with
a
scream
rolled
over
into
the
water
the
ditch
was
shallow
not
more
than
but
as
she
had
fallen
full
length
she
came
up
soaking
wet
even
her
hair
dripped
muddy
little
rivers
down
over
her
face
there
was
no
more
school
for
patty
that
day
as
soon
as
her
old
yellow
horse
could
be
saddled
she
started
off
on
a
lope
toward
dry
clothes
and
a
hot
dinner
mary
looked
after
her
longingly
as
she
sat
with
her
sleeve
held
out
in
the
sun
to
dry
and
slowly
munched
her
one
cold
apple
she
was
so
hungry
and
miserable
that
she
wanted
to
cry
yet
this
child
of
nine
was
a
philosopher
in
her
small
way
i
not
having
half
as
bad
a
time
as
the
old
vicar
had
she
said
to
herself
so
i
wo
be
a
baby
seems
to
me
though
that
it
about
time
fortune
was
changing
in
my
favour
maybe
the
turn
will
be
when
paul
finds
my
handkerchief
with
that
time
in
view
she
carefully
smoothed
the
wrinkles
out
of
her
sleeve
as
it
dried
and
pulled
the
lace
edging
into
shape
around
the
cuff
then
she
combed
the
front
of
her
hair
and
retied
the
big
bows
she
was
not
equal
to
the
task
of
braiding
it
herself
but
a
glance
into
the
little
celluloid
mirror
satisfied
her
that
she
looked
neat
enough
to
march
up
before
the
school
when
the
time
should
come
for
her
to
claim
her
handkerchief
every
time
the
door
opened
before
the
afternoon
recess
she
looked
up
expectantly
her
cheeks
growing
red
and
her
heart
beating
fast
but
no
paul
appeared
or
anybody
else
who
had
found
anything
to
be
restored
to
its
owner
she
began
to
feel
anxious
and
to
wonder
if
she
would
ever
see
her
beloved
handkerchief
again
at
recess
she
dodged
back
into
the
hall
after
every
one
had
passed
out
and
stole
a
quick
glance
into
the
other
the
handkerchief
was
gone
somebody
had
picked
it
up
maybe
the
finder
had
been
too
busy
to
search
for
the
owner
it
would
be
brought
in
before
school
closed
just
before
dismissal
probably
the
prospect
took
part
of
the
sting
out
of
the
recollection
that
she
was
to
be
kept
after
school
that
evening
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
during
the
last
period
in
the
afternoon
the
a
geography
class
always
studied
its
lesson
for
next
day
mary
specially
liked
this
study
and
with
her
little
primary
geography
propped
up
in
front
of
her
carefully
learned
every
word
of
description
both
large
print
and
small
on
the
page
devoted
to
africa
your
hair
is
coming
undone
whispered
the
girl
behind
her
let
me
plait
it
for
you
i
love
to
fool
with
anybody
hair
mary
nodded
her
consent
without
turning
around
and
sat
up
straight
in
her
seat
so
that
jennie
could
reach
it
with
greater
ease
she
never
took
her
eyes
from
the
page
the
teacher
who
was
putting
home
lessons
on
the
board
for
the
d
arithmetic
to
copy
was
too
busy
to
notice
jennie
new
occupation
illustration
she
proceeded
with
a
joyful
heart
to
paint
the
african
lion
mary
enjoyed
the
soft
touch
of
jennie
fingers
on
her
hair
it
felt
so
good
to
have
it
pulled
into
place
with
smooth
deft
pats
here
and
there
after
the
bows
were
tied
on
jennie
still
continued
to
play
with
it
braiding
the
ends
below
the
ribbon
into
plaits
that
grew
thinner
and
thinner
until
they
ended
in
points
as
fine
and
soft
as
a
evidently
they
suggested
brushes
to
jennie
for
presently
she
dived
into
her
desk
for
something
quite
foreign
to
school
work
it
was
a
little
card
on
which
were
arranged
seven
cakes
of
cheap
paint
the
brush
attached
to
the
palette
had
been
lost
on
christmas
day
before
she
had
had
more
than
one
trial
of
her
skill
as
an
artist
the
which
held
the
devoted
to
stood
behind
the
pile
of
books
in
her
desk
she
drew
that
out
and
having
uncorked
it
carefully
dipped
the
end
of
one
of
mary
braids
into
it
then
rubbing
it
across
the
cake
of
red
paint
she
proceeded
with
a
joyful
heart
to
paint
the
african
lion
in
her
geography
the
most
brilliant
red
that
can
be
imagined
mary
still
enjoying
the
gentle
pull
little
guessed
what
a
bloody
tip
swung
behind
her
right
shoulder
then
the
caressing
touch
was
transferred
to
the
left
braid
and
the
greenest
of
green
bedouins
mounted
on
the
most
purple
of
camels
appeared
on
the
picture
of
the
sahara
the
signal
for
dismissal
sounding
from
the
principal
room
across
the
hall
surprised
both
the
girls
the
time
had
passed
so
rapidly
mary
putting
her
hand
back
to
feel
if
her
bows
were
properly
tied
suddenly
jerked
her
right
braid
forward
in
alarm
the
end
was
wet
and
was
it
that
made
it
so
red
with
a
horrified
expression
she
clutched
the
other
one
and
finding
that
wet
and
green
turned
squarely
around
in
her
seat
she
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
geography
closing
on
the
red
lion
and
green
bedouin
and
realized
in
a
flash
how
jennie
had
been
fooling
with
her
hair
before
she
could
sputter
out
her
indignation
the
teacher
rapped
sharply
on
the
table
for
attention
will
you
come
to
order
mary
ware
she
said
sternly
remember
you
are
to
remain
after
the
others
are
dismissed
to
have
been
publicly
reprimanded
twice
in
one
day
to
have
been
kept
after
school
to
have
had
one
lunch
spoiled
by
ants
and
to
have
been
left
miserably
hungry
all
afternoon
to
have
had
the
shock
of
a
plunge
almost
to
the
shoulder
in
icy
water
and
the
discomfort
of
having
a
wet
sleeve
dried
on
one
arm
to
have
had
one
hair
used
as
so
that
stains
were
left
on
the
back
of
the
new
gingham
dress
was
too
much
mary
could
keep
inflexible
no
longer
then
she
remembered
that
no
one
had
brought
back
the
handkerchief
and
with
that
to
cap
her
woes
she
laid
her
head
down
on
the
desk
and
sobbed
while
the
others
filed
out
and
left
her
usually
holland
found
her
waiting
for
him
by
the
stile
when
the
grammar
grades
were
dismissed
but
not
seeing
her
there
he
forgot
all
about
her
and
dashed
on
after
the
boy
who
tagged
him
then
he
and
george
lee
hurried
on
home
to
set
a
new
they
had
invented
without
giving
her
a
thought
the
faithful
patty
who
always
walked
with
her
as
far
as
the
turn
had
not
come
back
to
school
after
her
plunge
into
the
lateral
so
it
came
about
that
when
mary
finally
put
on
her
hat
and
jacket
in
the
empty
the
playground
was
deserted
as
far
as
her
eyes
could
see
up
and
down
the
road
not
a
child
was
in
sight
with
a
sob
she
stood
a
moment
on
the
top
step
of
the
stile
then
slowly
swinging
her
in
which
there
were
no
scraps
as
usual
to
appease
her
hunger
she
started
on
the
long
walk
home
it
looked
later
than
it
really
was
for
the
sun
was
not
shining
she
had
gone
on
a
long
way
when
a
sound
of
hoofs
far
down
the
road
made
her
look
back
what
she
saw
made
her
give
another
startled
glance
over
her
shoulder
and
quicken
her
pace
she
looked
back
again
the
sound
was
coming
nearer
so
was
the
rider
another
glance
made
her
stand
still
her
knees
shaking
under
her
for
on
the
pony
was
an
indian
a
big
stolid
buck
with
black
hair
hanging
in
straight
locks
over
his
shoulders
she
looked
wildly
around
nobody
else
was
in
sight
no
house
anywhere
the
biggest
tiger
in
the
jungles
could
not
have
terrified
her
like
the
sight
of
that
lone
indian
all
the
tales
that
jack
and
holland
had
told
for
their
mutual
frightening
all
that
she
had
read
herself
of
tortures
and
cruelties
came
into
her
mind
their
name
was
legion
and
they
were
startlingly
fresh
in
her
memory
for
only
the
evening
before
she
had
finished
a
book
called
on
the
borders
with
crook
and
the
capture
of
the
oatman
girls
had
been
repeated
in
her
dreams
sure
that
the
indian
intended
to
tomahawk
her
the
instant
he
reached
her
she
gave
one
stifled
gasp
of
terror
and
started
down
the
road
as
fast
as
her
fat
little
legs
could
carry
her
a
few
rods
farther
on
her
hat
flew
off
but
she
was
running
for
her
life
and
even
the
handsome
steel
buckle
that
had
once
been
cousin
kate
could
not
be
rescued
at
such
a
risk
she
felt
that
she
was
running
in
a
treadmill
her
legs
were
going
up
and
down
up
and
down
faster
than
they
had
ever
moved
before
but
she
seemed
to
be
making
no
progress
she
was
unable
to
get
past
that
one
spot
in
the
road
and
the
indian
was
coming
on
nearer
and
nearer
with
deadly
certainty
gaining
on
her
at
every
breath
she
felt
that
she
had
been
running
for
a
week
that
she
could
not
possibly
take
another
step
but
with
one
more
frantic
glance
backward
she
gave
another
scream
and
dashed
on
harder
than
before
chapter
iv
ware
wigwam
phil
tremont
driving
out
from
phoenix
in
a
high
cart
paused
at
the
uncertain
whether
to
turn
there
or
keep
on
to
the
next
according
to
part
of
the
directions
given
him
this
was
the
still
he
had
not
yet
come
in
sight
of
camelback
mountain
which
was
to
serve
as
a
not
a
house
was
near
at
which
he
might
inquire
and
not
a
living
thing
in
sight
except
a
which
started
up
from
the
roadside
and
bounded
away
at
his
approach
then
he
caught
sight
of
the
little
whirl
of
dust
surrounding
mary
in
her
terrified
flight
and
touched
his
horse
with
the
whip
in
a
moment
he
was
alongside
of
the
breathless
bareheaded
child
little
girl
he
called
can
you
tell
me
if
this
is
the
road
to
ranch
then
as
she
turned
a
dirty
face
he
exclaimed
in
amazement
of
all
people
under
the
sun
the
little
vicar
well
you
a
sprinter
what
are
you
racing
with
mary
sank
down
on
the
road
so
exhausted
by
her
long
run
that
she
breathed
in
quick
gasping
sobs
her
relief
at
seeing
a
white
face
instead
of
a
red
one
was
so
great
that
she
had
no
room
for
surprise
in
her
little
brain
that
the
face
should
be
phil
tremont
who
was
supposed
to
be
far
away
in
california
she
recognized
him
instantly
although
he
no
longer
wore
his
uniform
and
the
hat
he
wore
suggested
the
cowboy
of
the
plains
rather
than
the
cadet
of
the
military
school
what
are
you
racing
with
he
repeated
laughingly
that
that
passed
me
down
yonder
a
a
a
she
managed
to
gasp
he
chased
me
all
the
way
from
the
schoolhouse
an
indian
repeated
phil
standing
up
in
the
cart
to
look
back
down
the
road
oh
it
must
have
been
that
old
fellow
i
passed
half
a
mile
back
he
was
an
specimen
but
he
could
have
chased
you
his
pony
was
so
stiff
and
old
it
could
go
out
of
a
walk
he
me
insisted
mary
the
tears
beginning
to
roll
down
her
face
again
she
looked
so
little
and
forlorn
sitting
there
in
a
heap
beside
the
road
that
phil
sprang
from
the
cart
and
picked
her
up
in
his
strong
arms
there
said
he
lifting
her
into
the
cart
no
more
my
lady
weep
no
more
fortune
has
at
last
changed
in
your
favour
you
are
snatched
from
the
bloody
scalper
of
the
plains
and
shall
be
driven
home
in
style
by
your
brave
rescuer
if
you
only
tell
me
which
way
to
go
the
little
face
was
one
broad
smile
as
mary
leaned
back
in
the
seat
she
pointed
up
the
road
to
a
clump
of
where
we
turn
she
said
when
you
come
to
the
trees
you
see
a
little
house
behind
them
it
the
white
bachelor
we
call
him
that
because
his
horse
and
dog
and
cows
and
cats
and
chickens
are
all
white
that
how
i
first
remembered
where
to
turn
on
my
way
home
by
the
place
where
there
so
awful
many
white
chickens
i
was
hoping
to
get
to
his
place
before
i
died
of
running
when
you
came
along
you
saved
my
life
did
you
i
never
had
my
life
saved
before
was
it
strange
the
way
you
happened
by
at
exactly
the
right
moment
it
just
as
if
we
were
in
a
book
i
thought
you
were
away
off
in
california
at
school
how
it
happen
anyway
she
asked
peering
up
at
him
under
his
hat
a
dull
red
flushed
his
face
an
instant
then
he
answered
lightly
oh
i
thought
i
take
a
vacation
i
got
tired
of
school
and
i
started
out
to
see
the
world
i
remembered
what
your
brother
said
about
the
out
here
and
the
ducks
so
i
thought
i
try
it
a
few
weeks
and
then
go
on
somewhere
else
i
always
wanted
a
taste
of
ranch
life
and
camping
i
tired
of
school
too
said
mary
specially
after
all
the
terrible
unpleasant
things
that
have
happened
but
my
family
wo
let
me
stop
not
if
i
begged
all
night
and
all
day
how
did
you
get
yours
to
did
ask
said
phil
grimly
just
chucked
it
and
came
away
but
did
your
father
say
anything
at
all
did
he
care
the
red
came
up
again
in
the
boy
face
he
does
know
anything
about
it
yet
he
in
europe
you
know
they
had
reached
the
white
bachelor
now
and
turning
took
the
road
that
ran
like
a
narrow
ribbon
between
the
irrigated
country
and
the
desert
on
one
side
were
the
wastes
of
sand
between
the
red
buttes
and
old
camelback
mountain
on
the
other
were
the
green
ranches
with
their
rows
of
figs
and
willows
and
palms
bordering
all
the
waterways
now
we
just
half
a
mile
from
lee
ranch
said
mary
we
be
there
in
no
time
do
you
suppose
they
have
room
for
me
inquired
phil
that
what
i
come
out
for
to
engage
board
oh
i
sure
they
will
anyhow
after
for
we
going
to
move
then
and
that
leave
three
empty
tents
we
rented
a
place
half
a
mile
farther
up
the
road
and
jack
and
joyce
are
having
more
fun
fixing
it
up
that
one
reason
i
want
to
stop
school
i
missing
all
the
good
times
hello
this
seems
to
be
quite
a
camp
exclaimed
phil
as
they
came
in
sight
of
an
adobe
house
around
which
clustered
a
group
of
twenty
or
more
tents
like
a
brood
of
white
chickens
around
a
motherly
old
brown
hen
there
comes
lee
now
cried
mary
as
a
tall
woman
came
out
of
the
house
and
started
across
to
one
of
the
tents
with
a
tray
in
her
hands
her
pink
dress
fluttered
behind
her
as
she
moved
forward
with
a
firm
light
tread
suggestive
of
buoyant
spirits
and
unbounded
cheerfulness
she
doing
something
for
somebody
all
the
time
remarked
mary
if
you
were
sick
she
nurse
you
as
if
she
was
your
mother
but
as
long
as
you
not
sick
maybe
she
wo
let
you
come
oh
i
never
thought
about
that
this
is
a
camp
for
invalids
you
know
and
she
is
so
interested
in
helping
sick
people
get
well
that
maybe
she
wo
take
any
interest
in
you
have
you
got
a
letter
from
anybody
oh
i
do
hope
you
have
a
letter
repeated
phil
what
kind
a
letter
to
say
that
you
all
right
you
know
from
somebody
that
knows
you
i
heard
her
tell
doctor
adams
last
week
that
she
take
anybody
else
unless
she
had
a
letter
of
of
something
or
other
i
ca
remember
because
one
man
went
off
without
paying
his
board
had
a
letter
from
her
brother
no
i
have
any
letter
of
recommendation
or
introduction
if
what
you
mean
said
phil
but
maybe
i
can
fix
it
up
all
right
with
her
ca
you
say
a
good
word
for
me
of
course
answered
mary
taking
his
question
in
all
seriousness
and
i
run
and
get
mamma
too
she
make
it
all
right
springing
out
phil
lifted
her
over
the
wheel
and
then
stood
flicking
the
dry
bermuda
grass
with
his
whip
as
he
waited
for
mary
to
announce
his
coming
he
could
hear
her
shrill
little
voice
in
the
tent
whither
she
had
followed
lee
to
tell
her
of
his
arrival
it
the
phil
tremont
we
met
on
the
train
he
heard
her
say
do
you
know
the
one
i
told
you
about
running
away
with
his
little
sister
and
the
monkey
and
the
one
time
he
is
sick
but
he
wants
to
stay
here
awhile
and
i
told
him
you
be
good
to
him
anyhow
then
she
hurried
away
to
her
mother
tent
and
lee
came
out
laughing
there
was
something
so
genial
and
friendly
in
the
humourous
twinkle
of
her
eyes
something
so
frank
and
breezy
in
her
hospitable
western
welcome
that
phil
met
her
with
the
same
outspoken
frankness
i
heard
what
mary
said
he
began
and
i
do
hope
you
take
me
in
for
i
run
away
again
mrs
lee
then
his
handsome
face
sobered
and
he
said
in
his
straightforward
boyish
way
that
lee
found
very
attractive
i
got
into
a
scrape
at
the
military
school
it
anything
wicked
but
four
of
us
were
fired
the
other
fellows
fathers
got
them
taken
back
but
mine
is
in
europe
and
it
so
unsatisfactory
making
explanations
at
that
long
range
and
i
thought
they
had
been
altogether
fair
in
the
matter
so
i
well
i
just
skipped
out
mary
said
i
have
to
have
references
i
ca
give
you
any
now
but
i
can
pay
in
advance
for
a
month
board
if
you
take
me
that
way
he
pulled
out
such
a
large
roll
of
bills
as
he
spoke
that
lee
looked
at
him
keenly
all
sorts
of
people
had
drifted
to
her
ranch
but
never
before
a
schoolboy
of
seventeen
with
so
much
money
in
his
pocket
he
caught
the
glance
and
something
in
the
motherly
concern
that
seemed
to
cross
her
face
made
him
say
hastily
father
left
an
emergency
fund
for
my
sister
and
me
when
he
went
away
besides
our
monthly
allowance
and
i
drew
on
mine
before
i
came
out
here
while
they
were
discussing
prices
ware
came
out
with
a
cordial
greeting
mary
excited
tale
of
her
rescue
had
almost
led
her
to
believe
that
phil
had
snatched
her
little
daughter
from
an
tomahawk
she
was
heartily
glad
to
see
him
for
the
few
acquaintance
on
the
train
had
given
her
a
strong
interest
in
the
motherless
boy
and
girl
and
she
had
thought
of
them
many
times
since
then
phil
felt
that
in
coming
back
to
the
wares
he
was
coming
back
to
old
friends
after
it
was
settled
that
he
might
send
his
trunk
out
next
day
when
a
tent
would
be
vacant
he
sat
for
a
long
time
talking
to
ware
and
mary
in
the
rustic
arbour
covered
with
bamboo
and
palm
leaves
chris
was
calling
the
cows
to
the
milking
when
he
finally
rose
to
go
and
only
rapid
driving
would
take
him
back
to
phoenix
before
nightfall
as
the
red
wheels
disappeared
down
the
road
mary
exclaimed
this
has
certainly
been
the
most
exciting
day
of
my
life
it
has
been
so
full
of
unexpected
things
is
it
grand
to
think
that
phil
is
coming
to
the
ranch
fortune
certainly
changed
in
my
favour
when
he
happened
along
just
in
time
to
save
my
life
oh
dear
there
come
joyce
and
jack
they
just
missed
him
saturday
afternoon
found
the
new
home
all
ready
for
its
occupants
even
the
trunks
had
been
brought
up
from
the
ranch
and
stowed
away
in
the
tents
although
it
was
only
two
the
table
was
already
set
for
tea
in
one
corner
of
the
clean
fresh
kitchen
behind
a
tall
screen
joyce
with
her
blue
calico
sleeves
tucked
up
above
her
white
elbows
whistled
softly
as
she
tied
on
a
clean
apron
before
beginning
her
baking
she
had
not
been
as
happy
in
months
the
hard
week
work
had
turned
the
bare
adobe
house
into
a
comfortable
little
home
and
she
could
hardly
wait
for
her
mother
to
see
it
lee
was
to
bring
her
and
norman
over
in
the
surrey
any
moment
they
might
come
driving
up
the
road
jack
had
offered
to
stay
if
his
services
were
needed
further
but
she
had
sent
him
away
to
take
his
holiday
as
he
tramped
off
with
his
gun
over
his
shoulder
her
voice
followed
him
pleasantly
good
luck
to
you
jack
you
deserve
it
for
you
stuck
by
me
like
a
man
this
week
since
dinner
mary
and
holland
had
swept
the
yard
brought
wood
for
the
filled
the
boiler
and
the
pitchers
in
the
tents
and
then
gone
off
as
joyce
supposed
to
rest
under
the
presently
she
heard
mary
tiptoeing
into
the
and
peeped
in
to
find
her
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
with
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
is
it
sweet
and
homey
mary
exclaimed
i
so
glad
to
see
the
old
furniture
again
i
could
just
hug
it
i
came
in
to
get
the
book
about
hiawatha
sister
holland
keeps
teasing
me
i
said
i
wished
i
was
named
minnehaha
and
says
i
am
and
i
want
to
find
a
name
for
him
a
real
ugly
one
call
him
suggested
joyce
the
book
on
the
second
shelf
of
the
bookcase
she
stepped
into
the
room
to
slip
the
soft
silk
curtain
farther
down
the
brass
rod
i
prouder
of
this
bookcase
than
almost
anything
else
we
have
she
said
nobody
would
guess
that
it
was
made
of
the
that
the
goods
came
in
and
that
this
lovely
persian
silk
curtain
was
once
the
lining
of
one
of
cousin
kate
party
dresses
i
glad
that
everything
looks
so
nice
said
mary
for
phil
said
he
was
coming
up
to
see
us
this
evening
i
going
to
put
on
a
clean
dress
and
my
best
before
then
very
well
assented
joyce
going
back
to
the
kitchen
i
change
my
dress
too
she
thought
as
she
went
on
with
her
work
and
i
light
both
lamps
the
indian
rugs
and
blankets
make
the
room
look
so
bright
and
cosy
by
lamplight
it
had
been
so
long
since
she
had
seen
any
one
but
the
family
and
the
invalids
at
the
ranch
that
the
thought
of
talking
to
the
jolly
young
cadet
added
another
pleasure
to
her
happy
day
oh
joyce
called
holland
from
behind
the
tents
may
we
have
the
paint
that
is
left
in
the
cans
there
only
a
little
in
each
one
i
do
care
she
called
back
that
had
been
an
hour
ago
and
now
as
she
broke
the
eggs
for
a
cake
into
a
big
platter
and
began
beating
them
with
a
fork
she
wondered
what
they
were
doing
that
kept
them
so
quiet
as
the
fork
clacked
noisily
back
and
forth
in
the
dish
and
the
white
foam
rose
high
and
stiff
her
whistling
grew
louder
it
seemed
to
fill
all
the
sunny
afternoon
silence
with
its
trills
for
joyce
whistle
was
as
clear
and
strong
as
any
boy
or
any
bird
but
suddenly
as
it
reached
its
highest
notes
it
stopped
short
joyce
looked
up
as
a
shadow
fell
across
the
floor
to
see
jack
coming
in
the
back
door
with
phil
tremont
she
had
not
heard
the
sound
of
their
coming
for
the
noise
of
her
and
her
whistling
joyce
blushed
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
at
being
taken
thus
unawares
whistling
like
a
boy
over
her
for
an
instant
she
wanted
to
shake
jack
for
bringing
this
stranger
to
the
kitchen
door
we
just
stopped
by
for
a
drink
jack
explained
tremont
was
coming
out
of
the
ranch
with
his
gun
when
i
passed
with
mine
so
we
been
hunting
together
come
in
phil
i
get
a
cup
there
was
such
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
phil
eyes
as
he
greeted
her
that
joyce
blushed
again
this
was
a
very
different
meeting
from
the
one
she
had
anticipated
instead
of
him
finding
her
appearing
to
her
best
advantage
in
a
pretty
white
dress
sitting
in
the
lamplight
with
a
book
in
her
hands
perhaps
he
had
caught
her
in
her
old
blue
calico
her
sleeves
rolled
up
and
a
streak
of
flour
across
her
bare
arm
she
rubbed
it
hastily
across
her
apron
and
gathered
up
the
in
embarrassed
silence
did
you
tell
those
kids
that
they
might
paint
up
the
premises
the
way
they
are
doing
demanded
jack
what
way
asked
joyce
in
surprise
have
you
seen
what
they
done
to
the
front
of
the
house
they
have
waited
for
your
name
contest
but
have
fixed
up
things
to
suit
themselves
you
just
ought
to
come
out
and
look
phil
followed
as
they
hurried
around
to
the
front
of
the
house
then
stood
smiling
at
the
look
of
blank
amazement
which
slowly
spread
over
joyce
face
down
one
of
the
rough
cottonwood
posts
which
supported
the
palm
and
bamboo
thatch
of
their
robinson
crusoe
porch
was
painted
in
big
straggling
bloody
letters
joyce
groaned
she
had
made
such
an
attempt
to
convert
the
rude
shade
into
an
attractive
spot
spreading
a
navajo
blanket
over
her
and
putting
cushions
on
the
rustic
bench
to
make
a
restful
place
where
one
could
read
or
watch
the
shadows
grow
long
across
the
desert
she
had
even
brought
out
a
little
wicker
this
afternoon
with
a
vase
of
flowers
on
it
and
leaned
her
mother
old
guitar
against
it
to
give
a
final
civilizing
touch
to
the
picture
but
the
effect
was
sadly
marred
by
the
freshly
painted
name
glaring
at
her
from
the
post
oh
the
little
savages
she
exclaimed
how
could
they
do
it
wigwam
indeed
then
her
gaze
followed
jack
finger
pointing
to
the
tents
pitched
under
the
the
one
which
she
was
to
share
with
mary
and
her
mother
stood
white
and
clean
the
open
showing
the
white
beds
within
the
rug
on
the
floor
the
flowers
on
the
table
but
the
large
circular
one
which
the
boys
were
to
occupy
was
a
sight
to
make
any
one
pause
perched
beside
it
on
a
scaffolding
of
boxes
and
barrels
stood
holland
with
a
in
one
hand
and
a
brush
in
the
other
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
some
startling
decorations
mary
on
the
other
side
was
brandishing
another
brush
and
both
were
so
intent
on
their
work
that
neither
looked
up
joyce
gave
a
gasp
never
had
she
seen
such
amazing
hieroglyphics
as
those
which
chased
each
other
in
zigzag
green
lines
around
the
fly
of
the
tent
they
bore
a
general
resemblance
to
those
seen
on
indian
baskets
and
blankets
and
pottery
but
nothing
so
grotesque
had
ever
flaunted
across
her
sight
before
now
get
the
book
called
holland
to
mary
and
see
if
we
left
anything
out
only
mary
back
was
visible
to
the
amused
spectators
she
took
up
the
copy
of
hiawatha
from
the
barrel
where
it
lay
careful
to
keep
the
hem
of
her
apron
between
it
and
her
thumbs
i
think
we
painted
every
single
figure
he
wrote
about
said
mary
now
i
read
and
you
walk
around
and
see
if
we
left
anything
out
very
spacious
was
the
wigwam
with
the
gods
of
the
dacotahs
drawn
and
painted
on
the
curtains
no
skip
that
ordered
holland
it
farther
down
fingers
travelled
slowly
down
the
page
then
she
began
again
sun
and
moon
and
stars
he
painted
man
and
beast
and
fish
and
reptile
figures
of
the
bear
and
reindeer
of
the
turtle
crane
and
beaver
owl
and
eagle
crane
and
and
the
cormorant
bird
of
magic
figures
mystical
and
awful
figures
strange
and
brightly
coloured
they
all
here
announced
holland
specially
the
figures
mystical
and
awful
i
have
to
label
mine
or
somebody
will
take
my
turtle
for
a
grizzly
oh
the
little
savages
exclaimed
joyce
again
how
could
they
make
such
a
spectacle
of
the
place
we
be
the
of
the
whole
country
i
do
suppose
that
ever
come
off
the
tent
but
we
can
paint
the
name
off
the
post
said
jack
oh
that
a
fine
name
said
phil
laughing
leave
it
on
it
so
much
more
original
than
most
people
have
before
joyce
could
answer
the
rattle
of
wheels
announced
the
coming
of
the
surrey
and
lee
drove
into
the
yard
with
ware
and
norman
and
her
own
little
daughter
hazel
then
joyce
anger
which
had
burned
to
give
holland
and
mary
a
good
shaking
vanished
completely
at
sight
of
her
mother
amusement
ware
had
not
laughed
so
heartily
in
months
as
she
did
at
the
ridiculous
figures
grinning
from
the
tent
it
seemed
so
good
to
see
her
like
her
old
cheerful
self
again
that
when
she
laughingly
declared
that
the
name
straggling
down
the
post
exactly
suited
the
place
and
was
far
more
appropriate
than
or
alamo
joyce
frown
entirely
disappeared
lee
caught
up
the
old
guitar
and
began
a
rattling
parody
of
john
brown
had
a
little
indian
changing
the
words
to
a
ridiculous
rhyme
about
wares
had
a
little
wigwam
ware
sat
down
to
try
the
new
rustic
seat
and
then
jumped
up
like
a
girl
again
to
look
at
the
view
of
the
mountains
from
the
and
then
led
the
way
laughing
and
talking
to
investigate
the
new
home
she
was
as
pleased
as
a
child
and
her
pleasure
made
a
festive
occasion
of
the
which
joyce
had
feared
at
first
would
be
a
sorry
one
phil
shouldered
his
gun
ready
to
start
off
again
feeling
that
he
ought
not
to
intrude
but
jack
had
worked
too
hard
to
miss
the
reward
of
hearing
his
mother
pleased
exclamations
and
seeing
her
face
light
up
over
every
little
surprise
they
had
prepared
for
her
comfort
come
and
see
too
he
urged
so
cordially
that
phil
fell
into
line
poking
into
all
the
corners
inspecting
all
the
little
shelves
and
cupboards
and
admiring
all
the
little
makeshifts
as
heartily
as
lee
or
ware
they
went
through
the
tents
first
then
the
kitchen
and
last
into
the
of
which
joyce
was
justly
proud
there
was
only
the
old
furniture
they
had
had
in
plainsville
with
the
books
and
pictures
but
it
was
restful
and
homelike
and
really
artistic
phil
acknowledged
to
himself
looking
around
in
surprise
here
the
little
colonel
corner
said
mary
leading
him
to
a
group
of
large
photographs
framed
in
you
know
mamma
used
to
live
in
kentucky
and
once
joyce
went
back
there
to
a
here
the
place
locust
that
where
the
little
colonel
lives
her
right
name
is
lloyd
sherman
and
there
she
is
on
her
pony
tar
baby
and
there
her
grandfather
at
the
gate
phil
stooped
for
a
closer
view
of
the
photograph
and
then
straightened
up
with
a
look
of
dawning
recognition
in
his
face
why
i
seen
her
he
said
slowly
i
been
past
that
place
once
several
years
ago
i
was
going
from
cincinnati
to
louisville
with
father
and
something
happened
that
we
stopped
on
a
switch
in
front
of
a
place
that
looked
just
like
that
and
the
brakeman
said
it
was
called
locust
i
was
out
on
the
rear
platform
i
believe
we
were
waiting
for
an
express
train
to
pass
us
or
something
of
the
sort
at
any
rate
i
saw
that
same
old
gentleman
he
had
only
one
arm
and
was
all
dressed
in
white
everybody
was
saying
what
a
picture
he
made
the
locusts
were
in
bloom
you
know
and
while
he
stood
there
the
prettiest
little
girl
came
riding
up
on
a
black
pony
with
a
magnificent
bernard
dog
following
she
was
all
in
white
too
with
a
spray
of
locust
blossoms
stuck
in
the
cockade
of
the
little
black
velvet
napoleon
cap
she
wore
exactly
as
it
is
in
that
picture
and
she
held
up
a
letter
and
called
out
pigeon
wing
fo
you
grandfathah
deah
i
never
forgot
how
sweet
it
sounded
oh
that
was
lloyd
that
was
lloyd
called
mary
and
joyce
in
the
same
breath
and
joyce
added
she
always
used
to
call
out
that
when
she
had
a
letter
for
the
old
colonel
and
it
must
have
been
hero
that
you
saw
the
red
cross
that
was
given
to
her
in
switzerland
how
strange
it
seems
that
you
should
come
across
her
picture
away
out
here
in
the
desert
mary
eyes
grew
rounder
and
rounder
as
she
listened
she
delighted
in
romantic
situations
and
this
seemed
to
her
one
of
the
most
romantic
she
had
ever
known
in
real
life
quite
as
interesting
as
anything
she
had
ever
read
about
does
it
seem
queer
to
think
that
he
seen
lloyd
and
locust
she
exclaimed
it
makes
him
seem
almost
like
home
folks
does
it
mamma
ware
smiled
it
certainly
does
dear
and
we
must
try
to
make
him
feel
at
home
with
us
in
our
wild
wigwam
she
had
seen
the
wistful
expression
of
his
eyes
a
few
moments
before
when
catching
joyce
and
jack
by
the
arms
she
had
cried
proudly
nobody
in
the
world
has
such
children
as
mine
lee
do
you
think
i
have
cause
to
be
proud
of
my
five
little
indians
who
fixed
up
this
house
so
beautifully
all
by
themselves
come
back
and
take
supper
with
us
wo
you
she
asked
as
he
and
jack
started
on
their
interrupted
hunt
we
make
a
sort
of
of
our
first
meal
together
in
the
new
wigwam
and
i
be
glad
to
count
you
among
my
little
indians
thank
you
ware
he
said
in
his
gentlemanly
way
and
with
the
frank
smile
which
she
found
so
winning
you
do
know
how
much
that
means
to
a
fellow
who
has
been
away
from
a
real
home
as
long
as
i
have
i
be
the
gladdest
indian
in
the
bunch
to
be
counted
in
that
way
then
i
get
back
to
my
said
joyce
if
we
to
have
company
for
supper
i
wo
promise
that
it
be
a
success
though
for
while
it
bakes
i
going
to
write
to
lloyd
i
thought
for
days
that
i
ought
to
write
for
i
owed
her
a
letter
ever
since
christmas
she
does
even
know
that
we
left
plainsville
and
i
going
to
tell
her
about
your
having
seen
her
and
recognized
her
picture
away
out
here
on
the
desert
i
wish
she
come
out
and
make
us
a
visit
here
said
phil
playfully
taking
a
sprig
of
orange
blossoms
from
his
buttonhole
and
putting
it
in
the
vase
on
the
wicker
table
when
you
get
your
letter
written
put
that
in
as
a
sample
of
what
grows
out
here
i
picked
it
as
we
passed
clayson
ranch
if
it
reaches
her
on
a
cold
snowy
day
it
will
make
her
want
to
come
out
to
this
land
of
sunshine
you
need
tell
her
i
sent
it
i
dare
you
to
tell
said
jack
as
they
started
off
joyce
only
answer
was
a
laugh
as
she
went
back
to
her
almost
by
the
time
the
boys
were
out
of
sight
she
had
whisked
the
cake
dough
into
a
pan
and
the
pan
into
the
oven
and
while
ware
and
lee
talked
in
the
other
room
she
spread
her
paper
out
on
the
kitchen
table
and
began
her
letter
to
the
little
colonel
chapter
what
a
letter
brought
about
lloydsboro
valley
would
have
seemed
a
strange
place
to
joyce
could
she
have
followed
her
letter
back
to
kentucky
she
had
known
it
only
in
midsummer
when
the
great
trees
at
locust
arched
their
leafy
branches
above
the
avenue
to
make
a
giant
arbour
of
green
now
these
same
trees
stood
bleak
and
bare
in
the
february
twilight
almost
in
drifts
of
snow
instead
of
a
green
lacework
of
vines
icicles
hung
between
the
tall
white
pillars
of
the
porch
gleaming
like
silver
where
the
light
from
the
front
windows
streamed
out
upon
them
and
lay
in
paths
across
the
snow
in
the
long
softly
lighted
by
many
candles
and
the
glow
of
a
great
wood
fire
the
little
colonel
sat
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
he
had
just
driven
up
from
the
station
and
she
held
his
cold
ears
in
her
warm
little
hands
giving
them
a
pull
now
and
then
to
emphasize
what
she
was
saying
the
first
of
the
season
papa
jack
think
of
that
had
enough
snow
this
wintah
for
any
amount
of
coasting
and
sleighing
if
it
had
only
lasted
that
the
trouble
with
kentucky
snow
it
melts
too
fast
to
be
any
fun
but
everything
is
just
right
moon
and
all
and
the
sleighs
are
to
call
for
us
at
seven
and
we
going
for
a
glorious
gorgeous
grandiferous
old
at
nine
we
stop
at
the
beeches
for
refreshments
yes
chimed
in
betty
from
the
where

letter
up
from

you
lloyd
feeling
in
several
pockets
he
at
last

big
square
envelope
he
was
searching
for
what

big
fat
one

at
the
postmark

sherman
watching

as
she
tore
open
the
envelope

cried

little

note

this
how
sweet
a
cluster
of
orange
blossoms
fell
out
into
her
lap
brown
and
bruised
from
the
long
journey
but
so
fragrant
that
betty
across
the
room
raised
her
head
with
a
long
indrawn
breath
of
pleasure
listen
i
read
it
aloud
wigwam
arizona
lloyd
mamma
note
to
your
mother
will
explain
how
we
happened
to
stray
away
out
here
next
door
to
nowhere
and
why
we
are
camping
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
instead
of
enjoying
the
conveniences
of
civilization
in
kansas
sketch
at
the
top
of
the
page
will
give
you
an
idea
of
the
outside
of
our
little
adobe
house
and
the
tents
so
without
stopping
for
description
i
begin
right
here
in
the
kitchen
where
i
am
sitting
waiting
for
a
cake
to
bake
it
the
cleanest
cosiest
kitchen
you
ever
saw
for
jack
and
i
have
been
cleaning
and
scrubbing
for
days
and
days
it
has
all
sorts
of
little
shelves
and
cupboards
and
cuddy
holes
that
we
made
ourselves
and
the
new
tins
shine
like
silver
a
tall
screen
in
the
middle
of
the
room
shuts
off
one
end
for
a
and
the
table
is
set
for
supper
we
are
to
have
our
first
meal
in
the
wigwam
holland
and
mary
named
it
that
and
painted
the
name
on
the
porch
post
in
big
bloody
letters
a
little
while
ago
the
open
door
i
can
look
into
the
other
room
which
is
library
studio
parlour
and
all
in
one
everything
is
so
spick
and
span
that
nobody
would
ever
guess
what
a
dreadful
time
we
had
putting
on
the
paper
and
painting
all
the
woodwork
i
spilled
a
whole
panful
of
cold
sticky
paste
on
jack
head
one
day
we
had
made
a
scaffolding
of
boxes
and
barrels
one
end
slipped
and
let
me
down
you
never
saw
such
a
sight
as
he
was
i
had
to
scrape
his
hair
and
face
with
a
spoon
then
so
much
of
the
paper
wrinkled
and
would
stick
on
crooked
but
now
that
the
pictures
are
hung
and
the
furniture
in
place
none
of
the
mistakes
show
has
gone
hunting
with
phil
tremont
a
boy
staying
at
lee
ranch
i
am
learning
to
shoot
too
i
practised
all
one
afternoon
and
the
gun
kicked
so
bad
that
my
shoulder
is
still
black
and
blue
phil
said
the
loads
were
too
heavy
and
he
is
going
to
loan
me
his
little
rifle
to
practise
with
he
is
such
a
nice
boy
and
oh
lloyd
it
the
strangest
thing
he
has
seen
i
have
those
pictures
of
locust
hanging
over
my
easel
and
when
he
saw
the
photograph
of
you
on
tar
baby
he
recognized
it
right
away
he
was
on
the
train
and
saw
you
ride
in
at
the
gate
with
a
letter
for
your
grandfather
and
hero
following
you
did
get
any
farther
than
this
in
my
letter
because
i
spent
so
much
time
making
the
illustrations
before
phil
and
jack
came
back
with
some
quail
they
had
shot
they
were
the
proudest
boys
you
ever
saw
and
nothing
would
do
but
they
must
have
those
quail
cooked
for
supper
they
could
wait
till
next
day
mamma
had
invited
phil
to
take
supper
with
us
and
help
make
a
sort
of
of
our
first
meal
in
the
new
home
had
the
jolliest
kind
of
a
time
and
afterward
he
helped
wipe
the
dishes
i
told
him
that
i
was
writing
to
you
and
he
took
this
little
piece
of
orange
blossom
out
of
his
buttonhole
and
asked
me
if
i
want
to
send
it
to
you
as
a
sample
of
what
we
are
enjoying
in
this
land
of
perpetual
sunshine
is
a
sample
of
everything
however
the
place
has
lots
of
drawbacks
oh
lloyd
you
ca
imagine
how
lonesome
i
get
sometimes
i
have
been
here
a
month
and
have
met
a
single
girl
my
age
if
there
was
just
one
to
be
chums
with
i
would
mind
the
rest
so
much
the
leaving
school
and
all
that
i
do
mind
the
work
even
the
washing
and
ironing
and
scrubbing
it
just
the
lonesomeness
and
the
missing
the
good
times
we
used
to
have
at
the
high
school
up
your
pennies
or
else
get
a
railroad
pass
you
and
betty
for
some
of
these
days
i
going
to
give
a
it
will
be
a
far
different
affair
from
your
could
there
ever
be
another
such
heavenly
time
but
there
are
lots
of
interesting
things
to
see
out
here
an
ostrich
farm
an
indian
school
and
reservation
and
queer
old
ruins
to
visit
there
are
and
gila
monsters
i
begin
to
name
the
things
that
would
keep
you
staring
lee
has
a
japanese
chef
and
a
mexican
to
do
her
irrigating
and
a
chinaman
to
bring
her
vegetables
and
she
always
buys
her
wood
of
the
indians
so
it
seems
very
foreign
and
queer
at
first
there
is
no
lack
of
variety
so
i
ought
to
be
satisfied
and
i
am
usually
except
when
i
think
of
little
old
plainsville
and
the
boys
and
girls
going
up
and
down
the
dear
old
streets
to
high
school
and
meeting
in
the
library
and
sitting
on
the
steps
singing
in
the
moonlight
and
all
the
jolly
sociable
village
life
and
the
friends
i
have
left
behind
for
ever
then
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
hardly
stand
it
here
i
wish
you
and
betty
were
with
me
this
very
minute
write
soon
with
love
to
you
both
and
everybody
else
in
the
family
and
the
dear
old
valley
homesick
ware
letter
was
cheerful
and
uncomplaining
but
there
were
tears
in
sherman
eyes
when
she
finished
reading
it
aloud
poor
emily
she
said
she
was
always
such
a
brave
little
body
i
do
see
how
she
can
write
such
a
hopeful
letter
under
the
circumstances
an
invalid
sent
out
into
the
wilderness
to
die
maybe
with
all
those
children
she
has
so
much
ambition
to
make
something
of
them
and
no
way
to
do
it
jack
if
you
go
out
to
the
mines
this
month
as
you
talked
of
doing
i
want
you
to
arrange
your
trip
so
that
you
can
stop
and
see
her
lloyd
looked
up
in
surprise
when
are
you
going
papa
jack
is
it
queah
how
things
happen
the
latter
part
of
this
month
probably
robeson
has
invited
me
to
go
out
with
a
party
in
his
private
car
he
is
interested
in
the
same
mines
i
wonder
began
sherman
then
stopped
as
mom
beck
came
to
announce
dinner
i
talk
to
you
about
it
after
awhile
jack
somehow
both
betty
and
lloyd
felt
that
it
was
not
the
summons
to
dinner
which
interrupted
her
but
that
she
had
started
to
speak
of
something
which
she
did
not
care
to
discuss
in
their
presence
arizona
has
always
seemed
such
a
dreadful
place
to
me
said
lloyd
hanging
on
her
father
arm
as
they
went
out
to
the
i
remembah
when
you
came
back
from
the
mines
it
was
yeahs
ago
befo
i
could
talk
plainly
mothah
and
fritz
and
i
went
to
the
station
to
meet
you
fritz
had
roses
stuck
in
his
collah
and
kept
barking
all
the
time
as
if
he
knew
something
was
going
to
happen
you
fainted
when
we
got
to
the
house
and
were
so
ill
that
you
neahly
died
i
heard
you
talk
about
a
fiah
at
the
mines
and
evah
since
i
thought
of
arizona
as
looking
like
the
sodom
and
gomorrah
in
my
old
pictuah
book
smoke
and
fiah
sweeping
across
a
great
plain
and
people
running
to
get
away
from
it
to
me
it
just
a
yellow
square
on
a
map
said
betty
of
course
read
about
the
wonderful
petrified
forests
of
agate
and
the
great
cañon
of
the
colorado
but
it
always
seemed
the
last
place
in
the
world
ever
want
to
visit
it
terrible
for
joyce
to
give
up
everything
and
go
out
there
to
live
the
waltons
were
out
there
several
years
said
sherman
they
were
at
fort
huachuca
and
learned
to
love
it
dearly
ask
them
about
it
they
will
tell
you
that
joyce
is
a
very
fortunate
girl
to
have
the
opportunity
of
living
in
such
a
lovely
and
interesting
country
and
does
not
need
any
one
pity
little
else
was
discussed
all
during
dinner
afterward
they
sat
around
the
fire
in
the
still
talking
of
the
wares
and
the
strange
country
to
which
they
had
moved
until
a
tooting
of
horns
and
a
jingling
of
bells
announced
the
coming
of
the
sleighing
party
both
the
girls
were
into
their
wraps
before
the
first
sleigh
reached
the
gate
they
stood
waiting
by
the
hall
window
looking
out
on
the
stretches
of
snow
what
a
cold
white
glistening
world
it
was
one
could
hardly
imagine
that
it
had
ever
been
warm
and
green
lloyd
put
her
nose
into
the
end
of
her
muff
for
a
whiff
of
the
orange
blossoms
she
was
taking
joyce
letter
to
show
to
the
girls
betty
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
stars
twinkling
above
the
bare
branches
of
the
caught
the
fragrance
also
and
it
fired
her
romantic
little
soul
with
a
sudden
thought
lloyd
she
exclaimed
what
if
that
orange
blossom
was
an
omen
what
if
phil
were
the
one
written
for
you
in
the
stars
oh
betty
the
idea
laughed
lloyd
you
always
imagining
things
the
way
they
are
in
books
but
this
happened
just
that
way
persisted
betty
his
passing
locust
on
the
train
and
seeing
you
when
you
were
a
little
girl
and
then
finding
your
picture
away
out
on
the
desert
several
years
after
and
sending
you
a
token
of
his
remembrance
by
a
friend
and
orange
blossoms
at
that
if
ever
i
finish
that
story
of
gladys
and
eugene
i
going
to
put
something
like
that
in
it
heah
they
come
interrupted
lloyd
as
the
sleighs
dashed
up
to
the
door
come
on
papa
jack
and
everybody
give
us
a
good
she
looked
back
after
her
father
had
helped
them
into
the
sleigh
to
wave
to
the
group
on
the
porch
how
interested
they
all
were
in
her
good
times
she
thought
even
her
grandfather
had
come
to
the
door
despite
his
rheumatism
to
wish
them
a
pleasant
ride
life
was
so
sweet
and
full
how
beautiful
it
was
to
be
dashing
down
the
snowy
road
in
the
moonlight
was
she
too
happy
everybody
else
had
troubles
would
something
dreadful
have
to
happen
by
and
by
to
make
up
for
all
the
unclouded
happiness
of
the
present
she
was
not
cold
but
a
sudden
shiver
passed
over
her
then
she
took
up
the
song
with
the
others
a
parody
one
of
the
seminary
girls
had
made
for
the
occasion
oh
the
snow
falls
white
on
my
old
kentucky
home
is
winter
the
valley
is
gay
the
moon
shines
bright
and
our
hearts
are
all
atune
to
the
jingling
on
our
sleigh
down
the
avenue
they
went
past
tanglewood
and
oaklea
through
the
little
village
of
rollington
on
and
on
through
the
night
songs
and
laughter
the
jingling
of
bells
and
the
sound
of
girlish
voices
floated
through
all
the
valley
it
was
not
every
winter
that
gave
them
such
sport
and
they
enjoyed
it
all
the
more
because
it
was
rare
it
was
nine
when
the
horses
swung
around
through
the
wide
gate
at
the
beeches
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
great
porch
where
hospitable
lights
streamed
out
at
every
window
across
the
snow
there
was
such
a
gabble
over
the
steaming
cups
of
hot
chocolate
and
the
little
plates
of
oyster
patés
that
lloyd
could
not
have
read
the
letter
if
she
had
tried
for
there
were
allison
and
kitty
and
elise
passing
the
bonbons
around
again
and
again
with
hospitable
insistence
and
saying
funny
things
and
making
everybody
feel
that
the
beeches
was
the
most
charming
place
in
the
valley
for
an
entertainment
of
that
kind
everybody
was
in
a
gale
of
merriment
miss
allison
was
helping
to
keep
them
so
and
some
of
the
teachers
were
there
from
the
college
and
two
or
three
darkies
with
banjoes
and
mandolins
out
in
the
back
hall
added
to
the
general
festivities
by
a
jingling
succession
of
old
plantation
melodies
however
lloyd
managed
to
tell
walton
about
the
letter
saying
it
almost
spoils
my
fun
to
think
of
poah
joyce
being
away
out
in
that
dreadful
lonesome
country
why
my
dear
child
cried
walton
some
of
the
happiest
years
of
my
life
were
spent
in
that
dreadful
country
as
you
call
it
it
is
a
charming
place
just
look
around
and
see
how
i
have
filled
my
home
with
souvenirs
of
it
because
i
loved
it
so
lloyd
glance
followed
hers
to
the
over
the
fireplace
the
tomahawks
that
set
in
mortars
captured
during
a
battle
in
luzon
guarded
the
hearth
instead
of
ordinary
andirons
the
baskets
the
rugs
and
the
navajo
portières
and
the
indian
spears
and
pottery
arranged
on
the
walls
of
the
stairway
even
that
string
of
loco
berries
over
geronimo
portrait
has
a
history
said
walton
come
down
some
day
and
i
tell
you
so
many
interesting
things
about
arizona
that
you
want
to
start
straight
off
to
see
it
her
duties
as
hostess
called
her
away
just
then
but
her
enthusiasm
stayed
with
lloyd
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
until
she
reached
home
and
found
her
father
and
mother
before
the
fire
still
talking
about
the
wares
and
their
wigwam
your
mother
wants
me
to
take
you
with
me
when
i
go
to
arizona
said
sherman
drawing
her
to
his
knee
robeson
had
invited
her
to
go
but
as
long
as
that
is
out
of
the
question
she
wants
to
arrange
for
you
to
go
in
her
place
and
leave
school
gasped
lloyd
yes

betty
help

could
easily
make
up
lost
lessons
during
the
summer
vacation

help
her

cried
betty
i
get
them
for
her
while
she
was
gone
if

could
oh

my
breath

lloyd

a
moment

then
say
it
all
ovah
again

asked

playfully
given

shaking
and
pinching
she
had
asked
for

her
in
astonishment
and
is
my
dainty
princess
winsome
he
said
at
last
i
thought
you
were
going
for
a
nice
tame
little
visit
i
be
afraid
now
to
take
you
you
want
to
come
back
on
a
bucking
broncho
and
dash
through
the
valley
shooting
holes
through
the
crown
of
people
hats
and
lassoing
carriage
horses
when
you
ca
find
any
wild
ones
to
rope
no
i
ca
take
you
now
afraid
of
consequences
no
honestly
papa
jack
laughed
lloyd
i
be
just
as
civilized
as
anybody
when
i
come
back
if
you
only
get
me
the
rifle
i
try
to
be
extra
civilized
just
to
please
you
we
see
was
the
only
answer
he
would
give
but
lloyd
who
had
never
known
him
to
refuse
her
anything
knew
what
that
meant
and
danced
off
to
bed
perfectly
satisfied
she
was
too
excited
to
sleep
to
see
joyce
again
to
share
the
wigwam
life
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
jack
and
holland
and
mary
who
had
been
such
interesting
personages
in
tales
of
them
to
have
that
long
trip
with
papa
jack
in
private
car
and
a
month
delightful
holiday
seemed
too
much
happiness
for
one
small
person
all
sorts
of
exciting
adventures
might
lie
ahead
of
her
in
that
month
the
stars
peeping
through
her
curtains
twinkled
in
friendly
fashion
at
her
as
if
they
were
glad
of
her
good
fortune
suddenly
they
made
her
think
of
betty
words
what
if
phil
should
be
the
one
written
for
you
in
the
stars
it
strange
his
having
seen
her
so
long
ago
and
finding
her
picture
in
such
an
unexpected
way
she
wondered
what
he
was
like
and
if
they
would
be
good
friends
and
if
she
could
ever
think
as
much
of
him
as
she
did
of
her
old
playmates
rob
and
malcolm
then
she
fell
asleep
wishing
that
it
was
morning
so
that
she
could
send
a
letter
to
joyce
on
the
first
telling
her
that
she
was
coming
that
in
less
than
two
weeks
she
would
be
with
her
at
wigwam
chapter
vi
and
washington
it
was
at
ware
wigwam
the
first
that
joyce
and
jack
had
personally
conducted
as
it
was
the
first
monday
after
moving
from
ranch
illustration
allee
samee
lak
chinamen
he
said
out
in
the
back
yard
a
big
tin
sat
propped
up
on
stones
above
a
glowing
from
time
to
time
jack
stooped
to
poke
another
stick
of
mesquite
into
the
blaze
or
give
the
clothes
in
the
boiler
a
stir
with
an
old
then
tucking
up
his
more
firmly
above
his
elbows
he
went
back
to
the
tub
by
the
kitchen
door
and
plunging
his
arms
into
the
suds
began
the
monotonous
swash
and
of
clothes
and
knuckles
on
the
we
allee
samee
lak
chinamen
he
said
to
joyce
who
was
bending
over
another
tub
rinsing
and
wringing
blimeby
when
we
do
heap
more
washee
a
cue
will
glow
on
my
head
you
be
no
mo
clistian
lady
you
be
heathen
gel
i
believe
you
right
laughed
joyce
i
certainly
felt
like
a
heathen
by
the
time
i
had
finished
rubbing
the
first
basket
full
of
clothes
through
the
suds
the
skin
was
off
two
knuckles
and
my
back
was
so
tired
i
could
scarcely
straighten
up
again
but
it
wo
be
so
bad
next
week
mamma
says
that
we
may
draw
enough
out
of
bank
to
buy
a
and
a
wringer
and
that
will
make
the
work
lots
easier
a
long
shrill
whistle
out
in
the
road
made
them
both
stop
to
listen
it
phil
said
jack
he
said
he
would
ride
past
this
morning
to
show
us
the
new
horse
he
is
going
to
buy
my
it
a
beauty
bright
he
exclaimed
peering
around
the
corner
of
the
kitchen
come
out
and
look
at
it
hastily
wiping
the
suds
from
his
arms
and
giving
a
hitch
to
the
suspenders
of
his
old
overalls
he
disappeared
around
the
house
joyce
started
after
him
then
drew
back
remembering
her
old
shoes
and
wet
faded
gingham
as
she
caught
sight
of
phil
sitting
erect
as
a
cavalryman
on
the
spirited
black
horse
from
the
wide
brim
of
his
soft
gray
hat
to
the
spurs
on
his
he
was
faultlessly
dressed
a
new
lariat
hung
on
the
horn
of
his
saddle
the
mexican
quirt
he
carried
had
mountings
of
silver
on
the
handle
and
the
holster
that
held
his
rifle
was
of
handsomely
carved
leather
while
he
talked
to
jack
the
horse
stepped
and
pranced
and
tossed
its
head
impatient
to
be
off
come
on
out
joyce
and
look
at
it
called
phil
i
ca
she
answered
peeping
around
the
corner
of
the
kitchen
running
a
chinese
laundry
back
here
jack
says
i
no
longer
a
lady
do
you
want
any
help
he
called
but
there
was
no
answer
she
had
disappeared
phil
was
disappointed
it
was
for
her
admiration
more
than
jack
that
he
had
ridden
by
on
the
new
horse
he
was
conscious
that
he
made
a
good
appearance
in
the
saddle
and
he
had
expected
her
to
show
some
interest
in
his
purchase
usually
she
was
so
enthusiastic
over
everything
new
the
work
might
have
waited
a
few
minutes
he
thought
but
it
was
not
the
urgency
of
the
work
that
sent
joyce
back
to
the
tubs
in
such
a
hurry
it
was
the
rebellious
feeling
that
swept
over
her
at
the
sight
of
his
holiday
appearance
she
was
tired
and
hot
and
bedraggled
having
splashed
water
all
over
herself
and
the
contrast
between
them
irritated
her
if
i
have
to
be
a
all
the
days
of
my
life
just
one
she
said
in
a
giving
the
towel
she
was
wringing
a
vicious
twist
i
not
going
out
there
to
have
him
feel
sorry
for
me
he
used
to
seeing
girls
who
are
always
dainty
and
fresh
like
his
sister
elsie
and
i
not
going
to
let
him
see
me
looking
like
a
poor
bedraggled
cinderella
it
is
fair
that
some
people
should
have
all
the
good
things
in
life
and
others
nothing
but
the
drudgery
jack
does
seem
to
mind
it
there
he
stands
out
in
the
road
in
his
old
faded
overalls
and
his
sleeves
rolled
up
never
caring
how
awkward
and
lanky
he
looks
he
taking
as
eager
an
interest
in
that
horse
good
points
as
if
he
were
to
have
the
pleasure
of
riding
it
but
then
jack
has
the
artistic
temperament
he
likes
this
wild
country
out
here
and
he
never
can
understand
what
a
daily
sacrifice
it
is
for
me
to
live
in
such
a
place
my
whole
life
is
just
a
sacrifice
to
mamma
and
the
children
by
the
time
the
basket
was
full
of
clothes
ready
to
be
hung
on
the
line
joyce
had
worked
herself
up
to
such
a
pitch
of
that
she
felt
like
a
martyr
going
to
the
stake
she
carried
the
basket
to
the
sunny
space
behind
the
tents
where
the
line
had
been
stretched
here
with
her
sunbonnet
pulled
over
her
eyes
she
could
see
without
being
seen
phil
was
just
riding
away
whistling
she
watched
him
out
of
sight
the
desert
seemed
lonelier
than
ever
when
the
sound
of
and
the
cheery
tune
had
passed
her
gaze
wandered
back
to
old
camelback
mountain
we
never
get
away
you
and
i
she
whispered
all
the
bright
pleasant
things
in
life
will
ride
by
and
leave
us
only
the
work
and
the
waiting
and
the
loneliness
will
stay
when
she
went
back
to
the
house
with
her
empty
basket
jack
was
rubbing
away
with
a
vigour
that
was
putting
holes
in
one
of
holland
shirts
why
did
you
come
out
and
see
phil
new
horse
he
cried
enthusiastically
he
let
me
try
him
and
he
goes
like
a
bird
and
say
joyce
he
knows
where
i
could
get
the
best
kind
of
an
indian
pony
for
almost
nothing
at
a
camp
near
scottsdale
it
is
good
size
and
broke
either
to
the
saddle
or
buggy
and
the
people
will
sell
it
for
only
ten
dollars
just
think
of
that
it
almost
giving
it
away
the
man
who
had
it
died
and
his
wife
could
take
it
back
east
with
her
and
she
told
them
to
sell
it
for
anything
they
could
get
do
you
think
we
could
manage
in
some
way
to
get
it
joyce
why
jack
ware
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
she
cried
for
us
to
spend
ten
dollars
on
a
horse
that
we
do
need
would
be
just
as
great
an
extravagance
as
for
some
people
to
spend
ten
hundred
do
you
know
that
we
can
only
buy
things
that
we
absolutely
have
to
eat
or
to
wear
you
surely
heard
it
dinned
into
your
ears
long
enough
to
get
some
such
idea
into
your
head
we
do
absolutely
have
to
have
a
and
wringer
he
declared
nettled
by
joyce
unusual
tone
a
horse
would
be
lots
more
use
we
could
have
it
to
bring
wood
up
with
from
the
desert
when
burned
all
that
close
by
and
we
ca
go
on
all
year
borrowing
a
horse
from
lee
every
time
we
want
to
go
to
town
or
have
to
have
a
new
supply
of
groceries
but
you
know
well
enough
that
mamma
teaching
hazel
after
awhile
when
she
gets
well
enough
will
more
than
make
up
for
the
borrowing
we
will
do
answered
joyce
besides
it
would
only
be
the
beginning
of
a
lot
of
expense
there
be
feed
and
a
saddle
to
start
with
no
there
would
there
all
that
alfalfa
pasture
going
to
waste
behind
the
house
and
lee
has
a
saddle
hanging
up
in
her
attic
that
somebody
left
on
a
board
bill
she
said
i
might
use
it
as
often
as
i
pleased
well
we
ca
afford
to
spend
ten
dollars
on
any
such
foolishness
said
joyce
shortly
so
that
is
the
end
of
it
no
it
is
the
end
of
it
was
the
spirited
answer
i
set
my
heart
on
having
that
pony
and
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
take
the
place
of
the
and
wringer
you
give
me
the
five
dollars
they
would
cost
and
i
do
every
bit
of
the
rubbing
and
wringing
every
monday
morning
i
borrow
the
other
five
dollars
and
give
a
mortgage
on
the
pony
i
find
some
way
to
earn
enough
to
pay
it
off
before
the
summer
is
over
joyce
shook
her
head
no
a
mortgage
makes
a
slave
of
anybody
foolish
enough
to
chain
himself
up
with
one
grandpa
ware
always
used
to
say
i
running
the
finances
now
and
i
wo
give
my
consent
i
think
it
is
best
to
get
the
machine
and
i
do
intend
to
change
my
mind
you
may
get
a
position
next
fall
and
then
i
be
left
to
do
the
work
without
any
machine
to
help
besides
you
run
in
debt
to
get
something
that
nobody
really
needs
i
do
need
it
insisted
jack
and
i
do
see
why
when
you
are
only
a
year
older
than
i
am
that
you
should
have
the
about
the
way
all
the
money
is
to
be
spent
because
mamma
wishes
me
to
do
you
see
that
the
very
fact
of
your
wanting
to
be
extravagant
in
this
case
and
go
in
debt
and
load
yourself
down
with
a
mortgage
shows
that
i
have
better
judgment
than
you
oh
you
got
a
great
head
for
business
sneered
jack
do
you
see
that
it
would
be
the
same
as
buying
something
to
eat
up
or
wear
out
it
an
investment
you
put
the
money
into
the
pony
instead
of
the
bank
and
any
time
you
want
to
get
it
out
you
just
sell
the
beast
i
might
be
able
to
get
twice
as
much
for
him
next
fall
when
the
tourists
begin
to
come
into
phoenix
for
the
winter
yes
you
might
but
it
would
be
more
like
ware
luck
for
it
to
cut
itself
all
to
pieces
on
the
fences
before
then
or
break
its
legs
stumbling
into
a
gopher
hole
or
founder
itself
by
getting
into
a
neighbour
something
would
be
sure
to
happen
the
money
is
safe
where
it
is
and
i
believe
in
letting
well
enough
alone
banks
bust
sometimes
too
said
jack
moodily
and
believe
that
venture
nothing
have
it
was
the
first
quarrel
they
had
had
in
months
each
feeling
firmly
convinced
of
being
in
the
right
grew
indignant
with
the
other
and
they
passed
from
teasing
banter
to
angry
words
and
then
to
an
angrier
silence
it
wo
be
any
harder
for
him
to
give
up
what
he
had
set
his
heart
on
than
it
is
for
me
thought
joyce
as
she
hung
up
the
last
garment
i
have
to
do
without
things
i
want
all
the
time
and
i
not
going
to
let
him
think
that
i
give
in
if
he
teases
long
enough
i
would
have
any
authority
at
all
over
the
children
if
i
was
firm
with
them
as
jack
emptied
the
last
tubful
of
water
and
stood
the
up
to
dry
he
broke
the
angry
silence
that
had
lasted
fully
ten
minutes
holland
has
a
dollar
in
his
and
mary
has
cents
we
could
all
chip
in
with
what
we
have
and
then
go
without
butter
or
something
for
awhile
till
we
saved
enough
joyce
only
gave
an
impatient
shrug
as
she
replied
much
comfort
get
out
of
a
horse
that
everybody
had
a
share
in
if
holland
felt
that
he
sunk
a
dollar
and
several
pounds
of
butter
in
that
pony
he
feel
privileged
to
ride
it
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
no
matter
who
wanted
it
and
he
do
it
too
you
might
as
well
give
it
up
jack
it
is
selfish
of
you
to
insist
on
spending
so
much
on
just
your
own
pleasure
selfish
blazed
jack
it
that
selfish
wanting
to
be
so
bossy
and
have
everything
just
your
way
i
have
asked
to
do
without
anything
have
i
or
to
put
in
any
of
money
and
if
i
do
the
work
of
the
and
wringer
i
do
see
why
i
have
what
they
would
cost
to
do
what
i
please
with
the
selfish
one
he
banged
the
tub
up
against
the
tree
and
walked
off
toward
his
tent
buttoning
his
and
muttering
to
himself
as
he
went
now
he
go
and
tell
mamma
i
suppose
and
worry
her
thought
joyce
as
she
went
into
the
kitchen
but
i
too
tired
to
care
if
i
been
so
tired
i
probably
would
have
snapped
him
off
so
short
but
it
just
goes
to
prove
that
we
ca
do
without
a
machine
the
washing
is
too
hard
for
me
without
one
i
ca
afford
to
get
so
worn
out
every
week
it
is
all
right
for
him
to
offer
to
take
the
place
of
one
he
might
keep
it
up
for
weeks
and
even
months
but
next
fall
if
he
should
get
a
position
in
phoenix
the
money
would
be
spent
and
i
be
left
with
the
bag
to
hold
i
do
think
that
under
the
circumstances
he
has
any
right
to
call
me
selfish
i
the
word
stuck
in
her
memory
and
hurt
as
she
dragged
herself
wearily
into
the
and
lay
down
on
the
couch
after
she
had
pulled
the
afghan
over
her
shoulders
and
buried
her
face
in
one
of
the
pillows
a
few
hot
tears
trickled
down
through
her
closed
eyelids
and
made
them
smart
the
kitchen
clock
struck
eleven
oh
dear
she
said
to
herself
i
must
get
up
in
a
few
minutes
and
see
about
dinner
but
the
next
thing
she
knew
norman
was
ringing
the
in
her
ears
shouting
that
it
was
one
and
that
jack
had
dinner
ready
and
to
come
before
it
got
cold
oh
jack
why
did
you
call
me
she
cried
i
did
mean
to
fall
asleep
i
only
stretched
out
to
rest
for
a
few
minutes
he
made
no
answer
busying
himself
in
carrying
a
hot
dish
of
poached
eggs
and
toast
to
the
table
and
bringing
his
mother
tea
he
was
carrying
on
a
lively
conversation
with
her
still
mad
i
suppose
thought
joyce
when
he
ignored
her
repeated
question
but
evidently
he
has
said
anything
to
mamma
about
it
the
meal
seemed
an
unusually
cheerful
one
for
although
jack
and
joyce
had
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
they
kept
up
such
a
chatter
with
their
mother
that
she
ate
her
dinner
serenely
unconscious
of
their
coolness
toward
each
other
afterward
she
insisted
upon
washing
the
dishes
so
that
joyce
could
take
a
rest
and
jack
go
down
to
the
ranch
to
see
ellestad
new
microscope
which
had
just
come
joyce
would
not
listen
to
her
appeal
that
she
was
perfectly
able
to
do
that
much
work
and
that
she
needed
the
exercise
but
finally
consented
to
her
helping
wipe
the
dishes
while
she
cleared
the
table
and
washed
them
but
jack
after
a
little
urging
started
down
the
road
toward
the
ranch
to
spend
a
long
interesting
afternoon
there
as
he
went
whistling
out
of
sight
ware
looked
after
him
fondly
i
know
he
the
best
boy
in
the
world
she
said
i
wish
i
could
afford
to
give
him
some
of
the
pleasures
that
other
boys
have
seems
to
me
he
has
about
as
much
as
the
rest
of
us
said
joyce
rattling
the
cups
and
saucers
in
the
but
a
picture
rose
in
her
mind
as
she
spoke
that
made
her
wish
that
she
had
not
been
so
cross
and
so
positive
it
was
phil
tremont
on
his
horse
as
he
had
looked
that
morning
handsome
and
free
to
do
as
he
pleased
and
then
in
sharp
contrast
jack
standing
in
the
road
beside
him
in
his
old
outgrown
overalls
his
fingers
red
and
wrinkled
from
the
suds
called
from
his
work
to
see
a
pleasure
in
which
he
could
not
share
now
that
she
was
rested
and
refreshed
by
her
dinner
matters
looked
different
she
could
even
see
the
force
of
jack
argument
about
the
pony
being
an
investment
and
she
wished
again
that
she
had
not
been
so
positive
in
her
refusal
but
having
once
said
no
joyce
felt
that
it
would
not
be
dignified
to
yield
if
she
changed
her
mind
this
time
jack
would
think
that
she
was
inconsistent
and
such
is
the
unyielding
policy
of
fifteen
that
she
felt
that
she
would
rather
be
called
selfish
than
to
admit
that
she
was
in
the
wrong
or
had
been
mistaken
it
was
a
long
afternoon
the
fact
that
she
and
jack
had
quarrelled
kept
recurring
to
her
constantly
and
made
her
uncomfortable
and
unhappy
he
came
back
from
the
ranch
at
as
if
nothing
had
happened
however
and
when
she
asked
him
some
question
about
the
new
microscope
he
answered
with
a
full
description
that
made
her
feel
he
had
forgotten
their
morning
disagreement
i
do
believe
that
he
cares
so
much
about
that
pony
after
all
she
thought
after
supper
when
holland
and
mary
had
disposed
of
the
dishes
she
drew
out
the
and
began
sprinkling
clothes
ready
for
the
next
day
ironing
the
boys
had
gone
to
their
tent
the
door
was
open
between
the
kitchen
and
the
so
that
the
heat
might
pass
in
to
where
ware
sat
knitting
by
the
lamp
mary
was
there
also
and
her
voice
came
out
to
joyce
shrilly
as
if
she
were
in
the
room
with
her
it
seems
a
waste
of
time
for
me
to
be
learning
new
pieces
to
say
at
school
when
i
know
at
least
a
dozen
old
ones
that
i
recited
in
plainsville
that
would
be
new
out
here
but
teacher
picked
this
out
for
me
she
going
to
keep
us
in
at
recess
if
we
do
know
our
pieces
friday
this
has
lines
in
it
and
i
only
four
nights
to
learn
it
in
that
is
not
bad
said
ware
consolingly
only
twelve
lines
an
evening
read
it
all
to
me
then
i
help
you
with
the
first
quarter
joyce
stopped
her
humming
as
mary
began
dramatically
boy
of
that
the
name
of
it
she
read
unusually
well
for
a
child
of
her
age
and
the
verses
were
new
to
joyce
you
have
heard
the
story
time
and
again
of
those
brave
old
heroes
the
men
who
left
their
homes
to
fight
or
fall
as
soon
as
they
heard
their
country
call
let
me
tell
you
of
one
unnamed
unknown
a
brave
who
fought
alone
when
the
breathless
messenger
drew
rein
he
had
started
whistling
down
the
lane
with
his
rod
and
line
to
the
brook
for
trout
but
he
paused
as
he
heard
the
warning
shout
and
his
father
called
to
him
my
son
i
must
be
off
to
lexington
there
is
little
time
for
fishing
now
you
must
take
father
place
behind
the
plough
one
quick
the
boy
stood
still
watching
him
climb
the
homeward
hill
in
and
out
of
the
house
again
with
his
musket
to
join
the
men
then
he
turned
the
furrows
straight
and
true
just
as
he
seen
his
father
do
he
dropped
the
corn
in
the
narrow
rows
and
fought
for
its
life
with
the
weeds
and
crows
oh
it
was
hard
as
the
days
wore
on
to
take
the
place
of
that
father
gone
the
boyish
shoulders
could
hardly
bear
all
their
burden
of
work
and
care
but
he
thought
is
for
my
country
sake
that
father
place
at
the
plough
i
take
when
the
war
is
over
and
peace
is
won
how
proud
he
be
of
his
little
son
but
they
brought
him
home
to
a
soldier
grave
wrapped
in
the
flag
he
had
died
to
save
and
ben
took
up
his
burden
again
with
its
added
weight
of
grief
and
pain
saying
bravely
all
things
now
i
must
take
father
place
behind
the
plough
and
harvest
came
and
went
steadily
still
to
the
work
he
bent
for
the
family
needed
bread
and
then
so
did
the
fighting
men
only
a
boy
not
a
hero
bold
whose
deeds
in
the
histories
are
told
still
there
fell
under
british
fire
no
braver
son
of
a
patriot
sire
than
this
young
lad
who
for
duty
sake
said
is
the
task
i
undertake
i
can
not
fight
for
my
country
now
but
i
take
father
place
behind
the
plough
i
wonder
why
it
is
said
mary
thoughtfully
as
she
came
to
the
end
that
all
the
heroes
live
so
far
away
that
nobody
knows
them
except
the
people
who
write
the
books
and
poetry
about
them
i
wish
i
knew
a
boy
like
that
you
do
said
her
mother
quietly
one
who
has
been
just
as
faithful
to
duty
just
as
much
of
a
hero
in
his
small
way
as
ben
who
said
the
same
thing
all
things
now
i
must
take
father
place
behind
the
plough
and
who
has
done
it
too
so
faithfully
and
well
that
he
has
lifted
a
great
burden
from
his
mother
heart
and
made
living
easier
for
all
the
family
why
mamma
do
i
know
him
was
it
somebody
in
plainsville
what
was
his
name
john
alwyn
ware
said
her
mother
with
a
smile
although
her
lips
trembled
john
alwyn
ware
repeated
mary
with
a
puzzled
expression
why
that
was
papa
name
and
you
said
that
he
was
a
boy
that
i
knew
is
it
jack
name
too
asked
her
mother
yes
so
it
is
but
how
could
take
his
father
place
behind
the
plough
papa
was
a
lawyer
and
never
had
any
plough
whatever
is
a
man
may
be
called
his
plough
explained
ware
gently
and
papa
duties
were
not
all
in
his
they
were
at
home
too
and
there
is
where
jack
tried
to
take
his
place
he
was
such
a
little
fellow
my
first
thought
was
how
am
i
ever
going
to
bring
up
my
three
boys
without
their
father
help
and
noble
example
and
he
came
to
me
his
little
face
all
streaked
with
tears
and
put
his
arms
around
me
and
said
cry
mother
i
take
papa
place
now
and
help
take
care
of
the
family
if
i
ca
do
anything
for
awhile
but
just
be
a
good
boy
i
do
that
much
and
set
them
a
good
example
and
from
that
day
to
this
he
has
never
given
me
an
anxious
moment
he
is
a
boy
fond
of
having
his
own
way
and
it
has
often
been
a
struggle
for
him
to
resist
the
temptation
of
doing
as
his
chums
did
when
they
were
inclined
to
be
a
little
wild
but
he
has
always
been
true
to
his
promise
and
holland
and
norman
have
both
been
easier
to
manage
because
of
the
example
of
obedience
he
has
always
set
them
so
you
see
the
heroes
do
always
live
so
far
away
after
all
you
been
living
in
the
same
house
with
one
and
did
know
it
norman
came
clamouring
into
the
kitchen
for
something
that
holland
had
sent
for
and
joyce
lost
the
rest
of
the
conversation
but
what
she
had
heard
stayed
with
her
little
scenes
that
she
had
almost
forgotten
came
up
in
her
mind
now
she
understood
why
jack
had
so
often
refused
to
join
in
the
larks
of
the
other
boys
it
was
not
because
he
was
lazy
and
indifferent
as
she
had
sometimes
thought
when
he
had
settled
down
with
a
book
at
home
instead
of
going
with
them
in
the
evenings
she
understood
too
why
he
never
answered
back
or
asked
why
not
because
he
had
any
less
spirit
than
holland
or
cared
less
for
his
own
way
it
was
because
of
the
promise
he
had
made
beside
his
father
coffin
he
was
setting
the
highest
example
he
knew
of
obedience
and
faithfulness
to
duty
how
could
i
have
called
him
selfish
she
asked
herself
when
this
is
the
first
time
he
has
asked
for
anything
for
his
own
pleasure
since
we
have
been
here
he
has
stayed
at
home
and
dug
and
delved
like
an
old
man
instead
of
a
boy
of
fourteen
and
of
course
it
must
be
as
dull
for
him
as
it
is
for
me
i
suppose
i
did
realize
it
because
he
never
complains
as
i
do
i
had
so
many
more
good
times
than
he
has
she
went
on
in
her
my
trip
to
europe
and
the
little
colonel
and
he
was
never
even
out
of
plainsville
until
we
came
here
as
she
thought
of
the
she
caught
the
gleam
of
the
little
ring
the
lover
knot
of
gold
on
her
finger
that
eugenia
had
given
her
to
remind
her
of
the
road
of
the
loving
heart
and
she
stood
quite
still
for
a
moment
looking
at
it
i
believe
i
do
it
she
decided
finally
and
fell
to
work
so
energetically
that
the
last
damp
roll
of
clothes
was
soon
tucked
away
in
the
basket
then
taking
the
candle
from
the
shelf
and
shading
it
carefully
with
her
hand
she
hurried
out
to
her
tent
dropping
on
her
knees
beside
her
trunk
she
began
turning
over
its
contents
till
she
reached
a
pink
at
the
very
bottom
inside
the
box
was
a
letter
and
inside
the
letter
was
a
gold
coin
the
five
dollars
that
cousin
kate
had
sent
her
christmas
she
had
put
it
sacredly
away
as
a
intending
to
add
to
it
as
she
could
until
there
was
enough
to
pay
for
a
course
of
instruction
in
illustrating
by
correspondence
the
address
of
an
art
school
which
advertised
to
give
such
lessons
was
copied
on
the
envelope
as
she
turned
the
letter
irresolutely
in
her
hands
she
heard
voice
in
the
next
tent
talking
to
holland
i
wonder
who
take
my
place
in
the
high
school
nine
this
year
would
i
give
my
eyes
to
pitch
for
them
when
they
play
the
plainsville
wish
i
could
see
old
charlie
scudder
red
head
behind
the
bat
again
and
do
i
wish
i
could
hear
him
giving
his
call
for
me
out
by
the
alley
gate
i
walk
from
here
to
phoenix
just
to
hear
it
again
i
do
miss
the
fellows
much
as
i
thought
i
would
said
holland
who
was
hunting
for
a
certain
hook
he
wanted
in
what
looked
to
be
a
hopeless
snarl
of
there
some
kids
go
to
this
school
and
i
see
about
as
much
fun
out
here
as
i
did
at
home
i
suppose
it
would
be
different
with
me
if
i
went
to
school
said
jack
but
it
gets
mighty
monotonous
poking
around
the
desert
by
yourself
even
if
you
have
got
a
gun
now
that
phil
tremont
has
his
horse
that
will
cut
me
out
from
going
with
him
for
i
have
to
foot
it
wherever
i
go
oh
i
know
where
there
a
dandy
indian
pony
for
sale
over
by
scottsdale
began
holland
george
lee
told
me
about
it
they
going
to
put
it
up
at
auction
saturday
if
they
do
sell
it
before
you
wish
you
had
it
you
can
bet
your
only
dollar
i
do
i
tried
to
talk
joyce
into
thinking
we
could
afford
it
but
she
would
be
convinced
i
do
see
why
she
should
always
have
the
said
holland
she
only
a
year
older
than
you
are
anyhow
she
sits
down
on
everything
we
want
to
do
as
if
she
was
our
grandmother
she
too
bossy
no
she
is
answered
jack
loyally
she
knows
what
she
is
talking
about
she
had
a
mighty
tough
time
trying
to
make
one
dollar
do
the
work
of
two
since
we
been
out
here
and
she
worked
like
a
squaw
and
it
powerful
hard
on
her
having
so
much
responsibility
what
she
says
in
this
wigwam
even
if
it
does
suit
our
tastes
a
warm
little
glow
came
into
joyce
heart
as
she
knelt
there
beside
the
trunk
unconsciously
playing
eavesdropper
how
good
it
was
of
jack
to
uphold
her
that
way
with
holland
who
was
always
resenting
her
authority
and
inclined
to
be
rebellious
hesitating
no
longer
she
reached
into
the
tray
of
her
trunk
for
the
purse
which
held
the
monthly
housekeeping
allowance
taking
out
a
crisp
bill
she
folded
the
coin
in
it
and
ran
out
toward
the
boys
tent
the
streaming
through
the
canvas
made
a
transparency
on
which
the
gods
of
the
dacotahs
stood
out
in
startling
distinctness
holland
shadow
bending
over
the
beside
the
candle
reached
to
the
top
of
the
tent
jack
waved
its
heels
over
the
of
the
bed
on
which
he
had
thrown
himself
jack
she
said
putting
her
head
through
the
opening
of
the
tent
where
the
flap
was
pinned
back
i
changed
my
mind
about
that
investment
i
decided
to
go
in
with
you
i
put
in
cousin
kate
christmas
money
and
if
you
still
want
to
take
the
place
of
the
and
wringer
we
use
the
five
dollars
they
would
cost
to
buy
the
pony
then
i
think
the
most
appropriate
name
we
could
give
it
would
be
chapter
vii
a
surprise
in
order
to
understand
the
excitement
that
prevailed
at
the
wigwam
when
it
was
announced
that
the
little
colonel
was
on
her
way
toward
it
one
would
first
have
to
understand
what
an
important
part
she
had
played
in
the
ware
household
to
begin
with
the
place
where
she
lived
had
always
seemed
a
sort
of
enchanted
land
to
the
children
the
old
kentucky
home
was
their
earliest
and
their
favourite
were
about
the
people
and
places
of
lloydsboro
valley
where
their
happy
girlhood
had
been
passed
they
might
grow
tired
of
red
riding
hood
and
cinderella
aladdin
and
even
ali
baba
and
the
forty
thieves
might
lose
their
charm
but
no
story
failed
to
interest
them
that
began
once
upon
a
time
in
lloydsboro
valley
these
reminiscences
had
passed
from
joyce
to
jack
and
on
down
the
line
with
the
high
chair
and
the
cock
robin
book
and
the
red
belonging
to
each
in
turn
but
claimed
by
all
tears
holland
tempers
and
norman
tantrums
had
many
a
time
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
at
those
familiar
words
after
joyce
return
from
the
at
locust
the
little
colonel
became
the
central
figure
of
interest
and
all
the
glamour
with
which
their
childish
imaginations
had
surrounded
the
place
now
gathered
around
her
like
a
nimbus
around
a
saint
to
mary
who
had
read
the
princess
winsome
until
she
knew
it
all
by
heart
lloyd
was
something
between
an
ideal
princess
who
played
on
a
golden
harp
and
an
ideal
little
schoolgirl
who
lived
in
a
real
palace
and
did
exactly
as
she
pleased
she
could
talk
of
nothing
else
after
the
letter
came
and
followed
joyce
and
her
mother
with
innumerable
questions
pausing
often
before
the
pictures
of
lloyd
and
tarbaby
the
boys
interest
in
her
coming
was
increased
when
they
found
that
she
was
going
to
bring
a
rifle
and
that
her
father
had
promised
to
hire
a
horse
for
her
as
soon
as
they
arrived
phil
who
came
so
often
to
the
wigwam
now
that
he
seemed
almost
one
of
the
family
caught
so
much
of
its
enthusiasm
over
the
coming
guest
that
he
planned
picnics
and
excursions
for
every
day
of
her
visit
he
even
had
a
voice
in
what
he
called
the
council
of
war
in
which
it
was
decided
to
let
the
two
older
boys
move
their
cots
holland
had
been
clamouring
to
sleep
outside
the
tent
ever
since
george
lee
told
him
that
he
had
begun
to
do
so
and
that
was
what
made
the
cowboys
so
strong
so
the
gaily
decorated
tent
with
its
figures
mystical
and
awful
was
made
ready
for
lloyd
and
norman
took
joyce
place
in
his
tent
she
know
that
she
really
out
west
when
she
once
sets
her
eyes
on
those
gods
of
the
dacotahs
holland
said
to
mary
on
their
way
to
school
one
morning
as
long
as
we
call
this
the
wigwam
i
think
we
ought
to
be
dressed
up
in
and
feathers
when
she
gets
here
i
do
it
mary
if
you
will
i
dare
you
to
i
double
dare
you
usually
a
double
dare
never
failed
to
have
the
desired
effect
upon
mary
she
would
attempt
anything
he
suggested
but
it
was
too
serious
a
matter
to
risk
the
first
impression
that
such
an
appearance
would
make
upon
lloyd
so
she
trudged
on
with
a
resolute
shake
of
her
little
blond
braids
and
big
blue
bows
no
holland
ware
i
going
to
stay
home
from
school
that
day
and
wear
my
very
best
white
dress
and
my
rosebud
sash
it
just
as
good
as
new
if
it
is
two
years
old
and
the
little
spots
on
it
where
i
squirted
do
show
at
all
when
it
tied
and
joyce
said
that
she
is
going
to
put
your
hands
to
soak
overnight
to
see
if
she
ca
get
them
clean
for
once
for
if
there
anything
the
little
colonel
abominates
it
dirty
hands
and
and
you
got
to
wear
a
necktie
every
day
and
go
into
phoenix
and
have
your
hair
cut
so
there
oh
i
have
have
i
repeated
holland
mimicking
her
tone
if
joyce
has
all
those
plans
in
her
head
she
can
just
get
them
out
again
not
going
to
be
a
dude
for
any
old
girl
in
the
country
i
do
care
if
it
is
lloyd
sherman
and
if
she
is
so
dreadful
particular
as
all
that
i
do
something
to
shock
her
every
day
till
she
gets
used
to
it
yes
i
believe
i
come
to
the
table
the
very
first
meal
in
a
blanket
with
feathers
in
my
hair
and
if
you
dare
tell
anybody
beforehand
i
i
well
i
get
even
with
you
in
a
way
you
wo
like
oh
holland
please
do
do
disgrace
us
begged
mary
who
always
took
his
threats
in
earnest
it
would
be
too
dreadful
give
you
something
nice
if
you
promise
not
to
what
will
you
give
me
what
have
i
got
that
you
want
oh
i
do
know
i
have
to
think
about
it
holland
had
no
intention
of
carrying
out
his
threats
but
he
kept
mary
in
a
fever
of
anxiety
all
week
saying
one
hour
that
he
think
about
her
offer
and
the
next
that
she
did
have
anything
he
cared
for
and
that
he
preferred
the
fun
of
tormenting
the
girls
to
anything
she
could
give
joyce
drew
a
star
on
the
kitchen
calendar
over
the
date
on
which
they
expected
lloyd
to
arrive
a
big
red
star
she
rejoiced
that
it
fell
on
a
wednesday
for
by
that
time
the
washing
and
ironing
would
be
out
of
the
way
her
first
experience
in
made
her
look
ahead
to
the
coming
mondays
as
weekly
bugbears
but
the
second
was
not
so
hard
as
the
first
true
to
his
promise
jack
did
all
the
rubbing
and
wringing
getting
up
at
daybreak
to
start
the
fire
under
the
big
out
in
the
yard
this
morning
as
he
touched
a
match
to
the
little
pile
of
kindling
and
fanned
the
blaze
with
his
hat
the
new
pony
grazing
in
the
alfalfa
field
came
up
to
the
with
a
whinny
and
put
his
head
over
the
fence
as
if
to
watch
him
oh
you
think
you
boss
this
job
do
you
mr
washington
said
jack
who
in
the
short
time
he
had
had
the
pony
had
grown
as
fond
of
him
as
if
he
were
a
person
and
who
talked
to
him
as
if
he
had
human
intelligence
well
you
ought
to
take
an
interest
in
the
washing
since
that
the
way
you
got
your
name
and
the
reason
you
are
here
wait
till
i
get
this
boiler
filled
and
i
bring
you
a
lump
of
sugar
washington
was
a
wiry
little
pony
he
had
a
wicked
light
in
his
eyes
and
was
too
free
with
his
heels
at
times
but
he
had
been
raised
as
a
household
pet
and
stood
like
a
kitten
while
jack
rubbed
his
nose
and
fed
him
sugar
take
it
easy
while
you
can
said
jack
if
i
have
to
work
like
a
dog
all
morning
on
your
account
to
earn
half
the
dollars
that
you
cost
us
i
put
you
through
your
paces
this
afternoon
to
make
up
for
it
think
that
you
are
the
wild
mazeppa
by
the
time
we
get
back
oh
such
a
nice
old
fellow
nobody
was
near
to
see
the
impulsive
way
in
which
the
boy
threw
his
arms
around
the
pony
neck
and
hugged
him
tight
the
feeling
of
possession
made
him
happy
as
a
king
as
he
sat
on
the
topmost
bar
braiding
washington
shaggy
forelock
while
the
sun
came
up
over
the
camelback
and
the
morning
chorus
of
swelled
louder
and
sweeter
over
the
awakening
world
the
fire
under
the
boiler
was
crackling
merrily
and
the
water
was
steaming
when
joyce
came
out
of
her
tent
and
started
toward
the
kitchen
she
stopped
a
moment
by
the
to
reach
through
and
give
the
pony
a
friendly
stroke
for
she
was
almost
as
proud
and
fond
of
him
as
jack
she
had
had
several
delightful
rides
on
him
once
with
jack
for
company
on
phil
new
horse
and
twice
with
phil
when
they
had
raced
for
miles
down
the
sandy
road
past
olive
orchards
and
orange
groves
sweet
with
the
coming
of
spring
i
going
to
clip
his
mane
said
jack
as
he
slipped
down
from
his
seat
and
followed
joyce
toward
the
kitchen
he
must
look
his
best
when
lloyd
comes
we
done
everything
to
that
tune
for
a
week
laughed
joyce
lloyd
comes
has
grown
to
be
a
sort
of
refrain
running
through
all
our
conversation
you
notice
now
at
breakfast
and
see
how
often
it
will
be
used
holland
was
the
first
to
repeat
the
phrase
as
he
took
his
seat
at
the
table
and
waited
hungrily
for
his
plate
to
be
served
when
lloyd
comes
you
have
some
of
those
good
little
corn
muffins
for
breakfast
wo
you
joyce
kentucky
people
are
used
to
cold
bread
joyce
smiled
at
jack
as
the
words
they
were
waiting
for
were
repeated
and
then
almost
mechanically
used
them
herself
in
her
answer
have
them
once
in
awhile
i
suppose
but
we
ca
afford
a
very
great
change
in
our
bill
of
fare
we
have
a
mighty
skimpy
dinner
for
there
not
much
left
over
from
sunday
and
we
be
too
busy
washing
to
stop
to
cook
but
i
want
to
have
a
big
baking
before
lloyd
comes
if
i
go
in
to
meet
her
wednesday
in
the
ranch
surrey
i
have
to
do
the
extra
cooking
afternoon
i
suppose
after
the
ironing
is
out
of
the
way
mary
cast
an
inquiring
glance
at
the
red
star
on
the
calendar
only
and
then
i
can
stay
home
the
day
after
that
when
lloyd
comes
and
wear
my
best
white
dress
and
my
rosebud
sash
oh
that
will
be
joyful
chanted
holland
imitating
her
tone
i
wish
that
i
were
able
to
help
you
more
with
the
work
said
ware
wistfully
then
you
would
have
more
time
for
preparation
norman
and
i
can
manage
the
tent
work
i
think
this
morning
then
i
go
down
to
the
seat
under
the
willows
and
finish
that
indian
head
sofa
pillow
we
must
have
that
done
before
lloyd
comes
seems
to
me
that
i
can
hardly
wait
said
mary
giving
an
impatient
little
wiggle
that
nearly
upset
her
glass
of
milk
i
wish
betty
were
coming
too
said
joyce
she
would
be
making
up
stories
from
morning
till
night
about
the
strange
things
out
here
but
she
would
have
much
peace
you
children
would
never
let
her
out
of
your
sight
like
davy
did
at
the
cuckoo
nest
said
mary
who
knew
history
almost
as
well
as
her
own
and
loved
dearly
to
talk
about
it
betty
devotion
to
her
godmother
since
she
had
gone
to
live
at
locust
and
her
wonderful
gift
for
writing
verses
and
stories
made
her
almost
as
interesting
to
mary
as
the
little
colonel
herself
as
she
moved
about
the
house
after
breakfast
doing
the
little
duties
that
fell
to
her
lot
before
she
chanted
in
a
happy
undertone
all
the
play
of
the
rescue
of
the
princess
winsome
from
beginning
to
end
sir
feal
the
faithful
knight
had
been
associated
in
her
mind
with
phil
since
the
day
he
rescued
her
from
her
fright
when
she
was
running
away
from
the
indian
she
was
the
princess
and
phil
the
gallant
knight
who
she
dreamed
in
her
romantic
little
heart
might
some
day
send
her
messages
by
the
and
as
sir
feal
had
done
of
course
not
now
but
some
day
when
she
was
grown
and
wore
long
lovely
dresses
and
had
a
beautiful
voice
she
had
pictured
herself
many
a
time
standing
by
a
casement
window
with
a
dove
clasped
to
her
breast
and
singing
the
song
flutter
and
fly
flutter
and
fly
bear
him
my
heart
of
gold
but
now
that
the
real
princess
was
coming
she
lost
interest
in
her
own
little
which
were
of
such
a
time
and
so
vague
and
shadowy
and
began
dreaming
them
for
lloyd
she
wondered
what
phil
would
think
of
her
when
they
first
met
she
had
already
recited
the
entire
play
to
him
and
showed
him
the
miniature
and
as
he
studied
the
sweet
face
at
the
casement
bending
over
the
dove
he
had
hummed
after
mary
in
an
sort
of
way
spin
spin
oh
golden
thread
he
dreams
of
me
night
and
day
the
poppy
chalice
is
sweet
and
red
oh
love
will
find
a
way
she
was
still
humming
it
this
morning
when
she
came
out
of
the
back
door
ready
to
start
to
school
and
her
thoughts
were
full
of
the
play
joyce
she
remarked
critically
pausing
to
watch
her
sister
put
more
wood
on
the
and
poke
the
clothes
in
the
boiler
with
the
end
of
an
old
you
look
like
the
witch
in
the
play
the
fire
i
pile
my
faggots
higher
and
higher
and
in
the
bubbling
water
stir
this
hank
of
hair
this
patch
of
fur
bubble
and
boil
and
coil
this
charm
shall
all
plans
but
the
ogre
foil
joyce
laughed
and
mary
slipping
through
the
bars
followed
holland
across
lots
to
school
i
do
feel
like
a
witch
in
this
old
dress
and
sunbonnet
she
said
and
i
must
look
like
one
but
no
one
ever
comes
here
in
the
mornings
but
phil
and
he
has
had
his
orders
to
stay
away
on
mondays
what
is
the
use
of
worrying
about
how
you
look
asked
jack
nobody
expects
a
fellow
to
play
chinese
laundryman
with
a
high
collar
and
kid
gloves
on
sousing
the
tubful
of
clothes
into
the
joyce
went
on
vigorously
with
her
morning
work
she
and
jack
relapsed
into
busy
silence
as
the
morning
wore
on
and
when
the
clock
struck
eleven
neither
had
spoken
for
nearly
an
hour
suddenly
a
sound
of
wheels
coming
rapidly
along
the
road
and
a
voice
made
them
both
stop
and
look
up
to
listen
are
we
getting
joyce
exclaimed
as
jack
shook
the
suds
from
his
arms
and
ran
to
the
corner
of
the
kitchen
to
watch
a
buggy
drive
past
so
few
people
come
out
this
desert
road
that
it
is
really
an
event
to
see
any
one
i
suppose
we
ought
not
to
be
blamed
for
staring
it
is
hazel
lee
said
jack
i
sure
that
her
voice
there
must
be
some
new
boarders
at
the
ranch
for
there
a
strange
gentleman
and
a
girl
in
the
buggy
with
her
and
she
standing
up
in
front
pointing
out
the
country
to
them
joyce
came
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
yes
that
hazel
she
said
she
the
knowingest
little
thing
i
ever
saw
for
a
child
of
five
you
could
lose
her
anywhere
around
this
region
and
she
is
as
good
as
a
for
giving
information
ellestad
was
laughing
the
other
day
about
her
disputing
with
the
white
bachelor
over
the
market
price
of
chickens
she
was
in
the
right
too
and
proved
it
she
hears
everything
and
never
forgets
anything
she
hears
illustration
thought
we
nevah
nevah
get
heah
she
saying
something
now
to
amuse
those
people
mightily
said
jack
as
a
hearty
laugh
rang
out
above
the
rattle
of
wheels
joyce
transferred
her
gaze
from
the
chubby
bareheaded
child
leaning
over
the
dashboard
with
eager
gestures
to
the
two
strangers
behind
her
then
she
grasped
jack
elbow
with
a
little
cry
of
astonishment
it
lloyd
she
gasped
lloyd
sherman
and
her
father
two
days
ahead
of
time
what
shall
we
do
everything
is
in
a
mess
and
nothing
in
the
house
for
dinner
that
instant
hazel
bright
eyes
spied
them
her
plump
little
finger
pointed
them
out
and
joyce
had
no
more
time
to
consider
appearances
for
springing
over
the
wheel
lloyd
came
running
toward
her
calling
in
the
soft
southern
accent
that
was
the
sweetest
music
to
joyce
ears
oh
you
deah
darling
old
thing
what
made
you
move
away
out
to
the
edge
of
nowhere
i
thought
we
nevah
nevah
get
heah
in
the
delight
of
seeing
her
again
joyce
forgot
all
about
things
being
topsyturvy
and
how
little
there
was
in
the
house
for
dinner
she
even
forgot
to
introduce
jack
who
stood
awkwardly
waiting
in
the
background
till
sherman
amused
at
the
girls
absorption
in
each
other
stepped
out
of
the
buggy
and
came
forward
laughing
it
looks
as
if
the
two
jacks
will
have
to
introduce
themselves
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
jack
awkwardness
vanished
instantly
at
this
hearty
greeting
and
a
moment
later
he
was
shaking
hands
with
lloyd
as
easily
as
joyce
was
welcoming
lloyd
father
wholly
indifferent
to
his
outgrown
overalls
and
in
the
meantime
hazel
who
was
a
in
her
small
way
for
comprehending
situations
had
of
her
own
accord
raced
off
to
find
ware
and
bring
her
to
welcome
the
unexpected
guests
and
you
are
aunt
emily
exclaimed
lloyd
turning
with
outstretched
hands
as
the
little
woman
came
toward
them
mothah
said
you
would
mind
if
i
called
you
that
because
you
and
she
have
always
been
such
deah
friends
there
were
tears
in
ware
eyes
as
she
returned
the
impulsive
kiss
she
had
expected
to
be
fond
of
elizabeth
only
daughter
she
had
hoped
to
find
her
pretty
and
sweet
but
she
had
not
looked
for
this
winsomeness
which
had
been
the
little
colonel
greatest
charm
since
babyhood
with
that
greeting
lloyd
walked
straight
into
her
heart
the
surprise
ended
more
satisfactorily
than
most
surprises
do
for
while
jack
was
unhitching
the
horse
and
ware
was
talking
over
old
times
with
sherman
whom
she
had
known
in
her
some
one
went
whizzing
around
the
house
on
a
bicycle
it
jo
the
japanese
chef
from
the
ranch
said
joyce
springing
up
from
the
front
where
she
sat
with
lloyd
and
starting
back
to
the
kitchen
to
ask
his
errand
oh
let
me
go
too
cried
lloyd
following
i
nevah
saw
a
jap
close
enough
to
speak
to
lloyd
could
not
understand
the
with
which
he
delivered
a
basket
he
had
brought
but
it
was
evidently
a
funny
proceeding
to
jo
he
handed
it
over
as
if
it
had
been
a
joke
doubling
up
like
a
as
he
pointed
to
the
contents
and
laughing
so
contagiously
that
joyce
and
lloyd
could
not
help
laughing
too
he
not
velly
nice
pie
maybe
giggled
jo
but
you
eat
him
allee
same
mis
lee
say
you
not
lookee
for
you
not
have
nuzzing
cook
did
lee
tell
you
to
bring
the
basket
jo
asked
joyce
he
shook
his
head
mis
lee
say
take
soup
pointing
to
the
large
glass
jar
of
clearest
consommé
smoking
hot
which
joyce
had
just
lifted
from
the
basket
i
bling
along
the
pie
for
my
she
no
care
she
kind
clistian
lady
she
certainly
is
laughed
joyce
now
we
can
at
least
begin
and
end
our
dinner
in
style
that
a
pie
jo
the
prettiest
i
ever
saw
the
little
almond
eyes
twinkled
as
he
watched
her
hold
up
the
dainty
pastry
with
its
snowy
meringue
for
lloyd
to
admire
aw
he
not
velly
good
pie
protested
jo
with
a
smirk
knowing
in
his
soul
that
it
was
the
perfection
of
pastry
and
eager
to
hear
joyce
say
so
again
i
heap
much
betta
time
then
with
another
laugh
he
whizzed
away
on
his
wheel
pausing
under
the
to
catch
up
hazel
and
take
her
home
on
his
joyce
asked
lloyd
as
she
watched
him
disappear
down
the
road
did
you
uncawk
a
bottle
or
rub
aladdin
lamp
i
feel
as
if
i
had
walked
into
the
arabian
nights
to
have
a
chef
suddenly
appear
out
of
the
desert
with
consommé
and
pie
like
a
genie
out
of
a
bottle
it
does
happen
every
day
laughed
joyce
i
suppose
that
after
you
stopped
at
the
ranch
to
inquire
the
way
here
and
picked
up
hazel
for
a
guide
that
it
occurred
to
lee
that
we
were
not
looking
for
you
until
wednesday
and
that
as
this
is
our
maybe
we
have
a
very
elaborate
dinner
prepared
and
she
thought
she
would
help
us
out
in
a
neighbourly
way
jo
enjoyed
coming
when
we
were
at
the
ranch
he
was
always
making
delicious
little
extra
dishes
for
mamma
oh
i
hope
our
coming
soonah
than
you
expected
has
made
a
difference
exclaimed
lloyd
i
nevah
thought
about
yoah
doing
yoah
own
work
robeson
decided
not
to
stop
in
new
mexico
as
long
as
he
had
planned
and
when
i
found
that
would
put
us
heah
two
days
soonah
i
would
let
papa
jack
telegraph
i
so
sorry
do
say
another
word
about
it
interrupted
joyce
the
only
difference
it
makes
is
to
you
and
your
father
you
not
been
received
in
quite
such
good
style
as
if
we
been
dressed
in
our
best
bibs
and
tuckers
but
maybe
you
feel
more
at
home
dropping
right
down
in
the
middle
of
things
this
way
lloyd
felt
as
if
she
certainly
had
dropped
down
in
the
middle
of
things
into
a
most
intimate
knowledge
of
the
ware
family
affairs
for
as
joyce
circled
around
setting
the
table
she
saw
that
a
pitcher
of
milk
bread
and
butter
and
some
cold
boiled
potatoes
sliced
ready
to
fry
was
all
that
the
pantry
held
for
dinner
if
joyce
had
spoken
one
word
of
apology
lloyd
would
have
felt
exceedingly
uncomfortable
but
she
only
laughed
as
she
put
the
consommé
on
the
stove
to
keep
hot
and
set
out
the
on
the
sideboard
lucky
for
you
she
said
that
the
genie
came
out
of
his
bottle
we
were
spending
all
our
energy
in
rushing
through
the
laundry
work
so
that
we
could
make
grand
preparations
for
but
we
have
equalled
jo
no
matter
how
hard
we
tried
while
joyce
talking
as
fast
as
she
worked
fried
the
potatoes
and
sliced
the
bread
jack
wrung
out
the
last
basketful
of
clothes
and
hung
them
on
the
line
and
then
disappeared
in
his
mother
tent
to
make
himself
presentable
for
dinner
lloyd
had
already
had
a
peep
into
the
tent
that
she
was
to
share
with
joyce
and
had
called
her
father
to
come
and
have
a
laugh
with
her
over
the
gods
of
the
dacotahs
which
were
to
guard
her
slumbers
during
her
visit
to
the
wigwam
he
was
to
leave
that
same
night
and
go
on
to
the
mines
with
robeson
and
his
party
her
trunk
was
brought
out
from
town
soon
after
dinner
and
while
she
partly
unpacked
it
putting
the
things
she
would
need
oftenest
into
the
bureau
drawers
that
joyce
had
emptied
for
her
jack
and
sherman
drove
away
to
look
at
the
horses
one
of
the
neighbours
kept
to
hire
to
tourists
they
came
back
later
with
a
shaggy
indian
pony
which
lloyd
at
once
mounted
for
a
trial
ride
joyce
went
with
her
on
washington
as
far
as
the
white
bachelor
lloyd
was
not
accustomed
to
a
cross
saddle
or
to
guiding
a
horse
by
the
pressure
of
the
against
its
neck
so
they
rode
slowly
at
first
when
they
were
almost
opposite
the
camp
at
lee
ranch
joyce
saw
a
familiar
little
figure
trudging
along
the
road
and
wished
with
sisterly
solicitude
that
they
could
avert
a
meeting
it
was
mary
on
her
way
home
from
school
dusty
and
dishevelled
as
usual
at
such
times
one
lost
and
the
braid
it
had
bound
hanging
loose
and
limp
over
her
ear
joyce
was
not
near
enough
to
see
but
she
felt
sure
that
her
were
dangling
that
there
was
ink
on
her
hands
and
maybe
her
face
and
that
at
least
one
button
if
not
more
had
burst
loose
from
the
back
of
her
dress
she
knew
that
the
child
would
be
overwhelmed
with
mortification
if
she
should
come
face
to
face
with
the
princess
winsome
in
such
a
condition
when
she
had
set
her
heart
upon
appearing
before
her
in
her
white
dress
and
rosebud
sash
before
joyce
could
think
of
an
excuse
to
turn
back
mary
had
settled
the
matter
for
herself
hazel
had
stopped
her
at
the
gate
to
tell
her
of
the
unexpected
arrival
so
she
was
not
wholly
unprepared
for
this
sudden
meeting
darting
up
the
high
bank
of
the
irrigating
ditch
like
a
little
gray
lizard
she
slid
down
on
the
other
side
into
its
dry
bed
and
crouched
there
till
they
passed
there
had
been
no
water
running
for
several
days
but
it
would
have
made
no
difference
to
mary
she
would
have
plunged
in
just
the
same
even
if
it
had
been
neck
deep
she
simply
could
not
let
the
adored
little
colonel
see
her
in
such
a
plight
joyce
almost
laughed
aloud
at
the
frantic
haste
in
which
she
scuttled
out
of
sight
but
seeing
that
lloyd
had
been
too
absorbed
in
guiding
her
pony
to
notice
it
she
said
nothing
and
delayed
their
return
until
she
was
sure
that
mary
was
safe
in
her
tent
so
it
was
that
when
lloyd
went
back
to
the
wigwam
one
member
of
the
ware
family
was
arrayed
in
all
her
glory
according
to
the
original
programme
mary
stood
out
under
the
washed
combed
and
clad
painfully
conscious
of
her
festive
garments
which
had
had
so
few
occasions
to
be
donned
on
the
desert
and
in
a
quiver
of
eagerness
it
was
not
only
lloyd
sherman
who
was
coming
toward
her
up
the
road
it
was
the
little
colonel
the
queen
of
hearts
the
princess
winsome
the
heroine
of
a
hundred
familiar
tales
and
the
beautiful
around
whom
she
had
woven
all
she
knew
or
imagined
of
romance
chapter
viii
in
the
desert
of
waiting
lloyd
sat
with
her
elbows
on
the
white
kitchen
table
watching
joyce
at
her
saturday
afternoon
baking
five
busy
days
had
passed
since
her
coming
and
she
felt
almost
as
much
at
home
in
the
wigwam
as
any
of
the
wares
phil
had
been
there
every
day
lee
had
invited
her
to
the
ranch
to
tea
where
she
had
met
all
the
interesting
boarders
she
had
heard
so
much
about
jack
holland
and
norman
devoted
themselves
to
her
entertainment
and
mary
followed
her
so
adoringly
and
copied
so
admiringly
every
gesture
and
intonation
that
holland
called
her
miss
whenever
he
spoke
to
her
out
of
his
mother
hearing
lloyd
could
not
fail
to
see
how
they
all
looked
up
to
her
and
it
was
exceedingly
pleasant
to
be
petted
and
deferred
to
by
everybody
and
on
all
occasions
the
novelty
of
the
place
had
not
yet
worn
off
and
she
enjoyed
watching
joyce
at
her
housekeeping
duties
and
helped
whenever
she
would
allow
it
how
white
and
squashy
that
dough
looks
she
said
as
joyce
turned
it
deftly
out
on
the
and
began
kneading
it
i
like
to
put
my
fingahs
in
it
the
way
you
do
and
pat
it
into
shape
and
pinch
in
the
cawnahs
i
wish
you
let
me
try
to
make
a
loaf
next
week
will
you
joyce
you
may
now
if
you
want
to
said
joyce
lloyd
started
to
her
tent
to
wash
her
hands
but
jack
shout
out
in
the
road
stopped
her
as
she
reached
the
door
he
was
galloping
toward
the
house
as
fast
as
washington
could
carry
him
and
she
waited
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
get
your
rifle
quick
lloyd
he
called
waving
his
hat
excitedly
chris
says
that
the
river
is
full
of
ducks
we
can
get
over
there
and
have
a
shot
at
them
before
if
we
hurry
i
catch
your
pony
and
saddle
him
while
you
get
ready
how
perfectly
splendid
cried
lloyd
her
eyes
shining
with
pleasure
i
be
ready
in
almost
no
time
then
as
he
galloped
on
toward
the
pasture
she
turned
to
joyce
oh
i
wish
could
go
too
so
do
i
was
the
answer
but
it
out
of
the
question
we
only
the
one
horse
you
know
and
i
have
any
gun
and
i
ca
leave
the
baking
so
there
three
good
reasons
but
i
glad
you
have
the
chance
lloyd
run
along
and
get
ready
do
you
bother
about
me
by
the
time
jack
came
back
leading
lloyd
pony
she
was
ready
and
waiting
at
the
kitchen
door
in
her
white
sweater
and
brown
corduroy
her
soft
light
hair
was
gathered
up
under
a
little
and
she
carried
her
rifle
in
its
holster
ready
to
be
fastened
to
her
saddle
oh
i
wish
you
were
going
too
joyce
she
exclaimed
again
as
she
stood
up
in
the
stirrups
and
smoothed
the
folds
of
the
divided
skirt
settling
herself
firmly
in
the
saddle
and
gathering
up
the
reins
with
one
hand
she
blew
her
an
airy
kiss
with
the
other
and
started
off
at
the
brisk
pace
jack
set
for
her
on
washington
joyce
called
a
laughing
after
them
but
as
she
stood
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
to
watch
them
ride
away
all
the
brightness
seemed
to
die
out
of
the
sunshine
how
much
i
should
have
enjoyed
it
she
thought
i
could
ride
as
well
as
jack
if
i
had
his
pony
and
shoot
as
well
as
lloyd
if
i
had
her
rifle
and
would
enjoy
the
trip
to
the
river
as
much
as
either
of
them
if
i
could
only
leave
the
work
but
i
like
that
old
camelback
mountain
over
there
i
never
get
away
it
will
be
this
way
all
the
rest
of
my
life
through
the
blur
of
tears
that
dimmed
her
sight
a
moment
the
old
mountain
looked
more
hopeless
than
ever
she
turned
and
went
into
the
house
to
escape
the
sight
of
it
presently
when
the
loaves
were
in
the
oven
and
she
had
nothing
to
do
but
watch
the
baking
she
brought
her
portfolio
out
to
the
kitchen
and
began
looking
through
it
for
a
sketch
she
had
promised
to
show
to
lloyd
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
opened
the
portfolio
since
she
had
left
plainsville
and
the
sight
of
its
contents
made
her
fingers
tingle
while
she
glanced
over
the
sketches
she
had
taken
such
pleasure
in
making
both
in
and
pen
and
ink
her
mother
came
into
the
kitchen
joyce
she
said
briskly
do
you
suppose
we
could
afford
some
cookies
while
the
oven
is
hot
i
have
baked
anything
for
so
long
that
i
believe
it
would
do
me
good
to
stir
around
in
the
kitchen
awhile
make
some
gingersnaps
and
cut
them
out
in
fancy
shapes
with
a
boy
and
girl
apiece
for
the
children
as
i
always
used
to
make
are
there
any
raisins
for
the
eyes
and
mouths
it
seemed
so
much
like
old
times
that
joyce
sprang
up
to
give
her
mother
a
squeeze
that
will
be
lovely
she
cried
heartily
here
an
apron
and
i
beat
the
eggs
and
help
you
no
i
want
to
do
it
all
myself
ware
protested
and
i
want
you
to
take
your
sketching
outfit
and
go
down
to
the
clump
of
willows
where
jack
put
the
rustic
bench
for
me
there
are
lovely
reflections
in
the
irrigating
canal
now
and
the
shadows
are
so
soft
that
you
ought
to
get
a
very
pretty
picture
you
have
drawn
any
since
we
left
home
and
afraid
your
hand
will
forget
its
cunning
if
you
never
practise
what
the
use
was
on
the
tip
of
joyce
tongue
but
she
could
not
dim
the
smile
on
her
mother
face
by
her
own
hopeless
mood
and
presently
she
took
her
box
of
and
started
off
to
the
seat
under
the
willows
mary
and
norman
like
two
muddy
little
beavers
were
using
their
saturday
afternoon
playtime
in
building
a
dam
across
the
lateral
that
watered
the
side
yard
joyce
stood
watching
them
a
moment
what
the
use
of
your
doing
that
she
asked
impatiently
it
stay
there
you
have
to
tear
it
down
when
you
stop
playing
and
then
there
be
all
your
work
for
nothing
we
do
care
do
we
norman
answered
mary
cheerfully
it
fun
while
we
doing
it
is
it
norman
as
joyce
walked
on
mary
lively
chatter
followed
her
and
she
could
hear
her
mother
singing
as
she
moved
about
the
kitchen
she
was
glad
that
they
were
all
happy
but
somehow
it
irritated
her
to
feel
that
she
was
the
only
discontented
one
it
made
her
lonely
she
opened
her
box
and
spread
out
her
material
but
she
was
in
no
mood
for
painting
she
could
get
the
right
shade
of
green
in
the
willows
and
the
reflections
in
the
water
were
blotchy
it
no
use
to
try
she
said
finally
mamma
was
right
my
hand
has
already
lost
its
cunning
leaning
back
on
the
rustic
seat
she
began
idly
tracing
profiles
on
the
paper
scarcely
conscious
of
what
she
was
doing
people
faces
at
first
then
the
outline
of
camelback
mountain
abstractedly
time
after
time
she
traced
it
with
slow
sweeps
of
her
brush
until
more
than
a
score
of
kneeling
camels
looked
back
at
her
from
the
sheet
of
paper
presently
a
cough
just
behind
her
aroused
her
from
her
fit
of
abstraction
and
turning
hastily
she
saw
ellestad
the
old
norwegian
coming
toward
her
along
the
little
path
from
the
house
he
had
been
almost
a
daily
visitor
at
the
wigwam
since
they
moved
into
it
not
always
coming
in
usually
stopping
for
only
a
moment
chat
under
the
as
he
strolled
by
but
several
times
he
had
spent
an
entire
morning
with
them
reading
aloud
while
joyce
ironed
and
her
mother
sewed
and
norman
built
block
houses
on
the
floor
beside
them
once
he
had
taken
tea
with
them
he
rarely
came
without
bringing
a
book
or
a
new
magazine
or
something
of
interest
and
even
when
he
was
his
unfailing
cheerfulness
made
his
visits
a
benefaction
mary
and
norman
called
him
uncle
jan
such
a
feeling
of
kinship
had
grown
up
between
them
mary
said
you
were
here
he
began
in
his
quaint
hesitating
fashion
so
i
came
to
find
you
i
have
finished
my
legend
at
last
the
legend
i
have
made
about
camelback
mountain
you
know
i
have
always
insisted
that
there
should
be
one
and
as
tradition
has
failed
to
hand
one
down
to
us
the
task
of
manufacturing
one
has
haunted
me
for
three
winters
always
it
seems
the
old
mountain
has
something
to
say
to
me
whenever
i
look
at
it
something
i
failed
to
understand
but
at
last
i
have
interpreted
its
message
to
mankind
with
a
hearty
greeting
joyce
moved
over
to
make
room
for
him
upon
the
bench
and
as
he
sat
down
he
saw
the
sheet
of
paper
on
her
lap
covered
with
the
repeated
outlines
of
the
old
mountain
ah
it
has
been
speaking
to
you
also
he
exclaimed
what
did
it
say
just
one
word
answered
joyce
everything
out
here
is
hopeless
it
useless
to
try
to
do
anything
or
be
anything
if
fate
has
brought
you
here
kneel
down
and
give
up
no
use
to
struggle
no
use
to
hope
you
never
get
away
he
started
forward
eagerly
at
first
yes
that
is
what
i
thought
it
said
to
me
but
now
i
know
it
was
only
the
echo
of
my
own
bitter
mood
i
heard
but
it
is
a
mistake
that
is
not
its
message
listen
i
want
to
read
it
to
you
he
took
a
from
his
pocket
of
course
it
is
crude
yet
this
is
only
the
first
draft
i
shall
polish
it
and
study
every
word
and
fit
the
sentences
into
place
until
the
thought
is
crystallized
as
a
real
legend
should
be
to
be
handed
down
to
future
generations
then
people
will
not
suspect
that
it
is
a
thing
spun
from
the
fancy
of
one
jan
ellestad
a
simple
old
norwegian
who
had
no
other
legacy
to
leave
the
world
he
loved
this
is
it
upon
a
time
a
caravan
set
out
across
the
desert
laden
with
merchandise
for
a
market
some
of
the
camels
bore
in
their
packs
that
held
the
richest
vintage
of
the
orient
some
bore
tapestries
and
some
carried
dyestuffs
and
the
silken
fruits
of
the
loom
on
shapur
camel
was
a
heavy
load
of
salt
hope
of
each
merchant
was
to
reach
the
city
of
his
desire
before
the
golden
gate
should
close
there
were
other
gates
by
which
they
might
enter
but
this
one
opening
once
a
year
to
admit
the
visiting
rajahs
from
the
sister
cities
afforded
a
rare
opportunity
to
those
fortunate
enough
to
arrive
at
the
same
time
it
was
the
privilege
of
any
who
might
fall
in
with
the
royal
retinue
to
follow
in
its
train
to
the
ruling
rajah
palace
and
gain
access
to
its
courtyard
and
wares
displayed
there
for
sale
often
brought
fabulous
sums
a
hundredfold
greater
sometimes
than
when
offered
in
the
open
market
to
a
privileged
few
would
the
golden
gate
ever
swing
open
at
any
other
time
it
would
turn
on
its
hinges
for
any
one
sent
at
a
behest
or
any
one
bearing
something
so
rare
and
precious
that
only
princes
could
purchase
no
common
vender
could
hope
to
pass
its
shining
portal
save
in
the
rear
of
the
train
that
yearly
followed
the
rajahs
they
urged
their
beasts
with
all
diligence
foremost
in
the
caravan
and
most
zealous
of
all
was
shapur
in
his
heart
burned
the
desire
to
be
first
to
enter
the
golden
gate
and
the
first
one
at
the
palace
with
his
wares
but
across
the
desert
as
they
paused
at
an
oasis
to
rest
a
dire
lameness
fell
upon
his
camel
and
it
sank
upon
the
sand
in
vain
he
urged
it
to
continue
its
journey
the
poor
beast
could
not
rise
under
its
great
load
by
sack
he
lessened
its
burden
throwing
it
off
grudgingly
and
with
sighs
for
he
was
minded
to
lose
as
little
as
possible
of
his
prospective
fortune
but
even
rid
of
its
entire
load
the
camel
could
not
rise
and
shapur
was
forced
to
let
his
companions
go
on
without
him
long
days
and
nights
he
watched
beside
his
camel
bringing
it
water
from
the
fountain
and
feeding
it
with
the
herbage
of
the
oasis
and
at
last
was
rewarded
by
seeing
it
struggle
to
its
feet
and
take
a
few
limping
steps
in
his
distress
of
mind
at
being
left
behind
by
the
caravan
he
had
not
noticed
where
he
had
thrown
the
load
a
tiny
rill
trickling
down
from
the
fountain
had
run
through
the
sacks
and
dissolved
the
salt
and
when
he
went
to
gather
up
his
load
only
a
paltry
portion
was
left
a
single
sackful
now
allah
has
indeed
forgotten
me
he
cried
and
cursing
the
day
that
he
was
born
he
rent
his
mantle
and
beat
upon
his
breast
even
if
his
camel
were
able
to
set
out
across
the
desert
it
would
be
useless
to
seek
a
market
now
that
he
had
no
merchandise
so
he
sat
on
the
ground
his
head
bowed
in
his
hands
water
there
was
for
him
to
drink
and
the
fruit
of
the
and
the
cooling
shade
of
many
trees
but
he
counted
them
as
naught
a
fever
of
unrest
consumed
him
a
baffled
ambition
bowed
his
head
in
the
dust
he
looked
at
his
poor
camel
kneeling
in
the
sand
he
cried
out
ah
woe
is
me
of
all
created
things
i
am
most
miserable
of
all
dooms
mine
is
the
most
unjust
why
should
i
with
life
beating
strong
in
my
veins
and
ambition
like
a
burning
simoom
in
my
breast
be
left
here
helpless
on
the
sands
where
i
can
achieve
nothing
and
can
make
no
progress
toward
the
city
of
my
desire
day
as
he
sat
thus
under
the
palms
a
bee
buzzed
about
him
he
brushed
it
away
but
it
returned
so
persistently
that
he
looked
up
with
languid
interest
where
there
are
bees
there
must
be
honey
he
said
if
there
be
any
sweetness
in
this
desert
better
that
i
should
go
in
its
quest
than
sit
here
bewailing
my
fate
the
camel
browsing
by
the
fountain
he
followed
the
bee
for
many
miles
he
pursued
it
till
far
in
the
distance
he
beheld
the
of
another
oasis
he
quickened
his
steps
for
an
odour
rare
as
the
perfumes
of
paradise
floated
out
to
meet
him
the
bee
had
led
him
to
the
rose
garden
of
omar
omar
was
an
alchemist
a
sage
with
the
miraculous
power
of
transmuting
the
most
common
things
of
earth
into
something
precious
the
fame
of
his
skill
had
travelled
to
far
countries
so
many
pilgrims
sought
him
to
beg
his
wizard
touch
that
the
question
where
is
the
house
of
omar
was
heard
daily
at
the
gates
of
the
city
but
for
a
generation
that
question
had
remained
unanswered
no
man
knew
the
place
of
the
house
of
omar
since
he
had
taken
upon
himself
the
life
of
a
hermit
somewhere
they
knew
in
the
solitude
of
the
desert
he
was
practising
the
mysteries
of
his
art
and
probing
deeper
into
its
secrets
but
no
one
could
point
to
the
path
leading
thither
only
the
bees
knew
and
following
the
bee
shapur
found
himself
in
the
old
alchemist
presence
shapur
was
a
youth
of
gracious
mien
and
pleasing
withal
with
straightforward
speech
he
told
his
story
and
omar
who
could
read
the
minds
of
men
as
readily
as
unrolled
parchments
was
touched
by
his
tale
he
bade
him
come
in
and
be
his
guest
until
sundown
shapur
sat
at
his
board
and
shared
his
bread
and
rose
refreshed
by
his
wine
and
his
wise
words
and
at
parting
the
old
man
said
with
a
keen
glance
into
his
eyes
thou
thinkest
that
because
i
am
omar
with
the
power
to
transmute
all
common
things
to
precious
ones
how
easily
i
could
take
the
remnant
of
salt
that
is
still
left
to
thee
in
thy
sack
and
change
it
into
gold
then
couldst
thou
go
joyfully
on
to
the
city
of
thy
desire
as
soon
as
thy
camel
is
able
to
carry
thee
far
richer
for
thy
delay
heart
gave
a
bound
of
hope
for
that
is
truly
what
he
had
been
thinking
but
at
the
next
words
it
sank
nay
shapur
each
man
must
be
his
own
alchemist
believe
me
for
thee
the
desert
holds
a
greater
opportunity
than
kings
houses
could
offer
give
me
but
thy
patient
service
in
this
time
of
waiting
and
i
will
share
such
secrets
with
thee
that
when
thou
dost
finally
win
to
the
golden
gate
it
shall
be
with
wares
that
shall
gain
for
thee
a
royal
entrance
shapur
went
back
to
his
camel
and
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
urged
it
to
its
feet
and
led
it
slowly
across
the
sands
and
because
it
could
bear
no
burden
he
lifted
the
remaining
sack
of
salt
to
his
own
back
and
carried
it
on
his
shoulders
all
the
way
when
the
moon
shone
white
and
full
in
the
zenith
over
the
rose
garden
of
omar
he
knocked
at
the
gate
calling
here
am
i
omar
at
thy
bidding
and
here
is
the
remnant
of
my
salt
all
that
i
have
left
i
bring
to
thee
and
stand
ready
now
to
yield
my
patient
service
omar
bade
him
lead
his
camel
to
the
fountain
and
leave
him
to
browse
on
the
herbage
around
it
pointing
to
a
row
of
great
stone
jars
he
said
there
is
thy
work
every
morning
before
sunrise
they
must
be
filled
with
plucked
from
the
myriad
roses
of
the
garden
and
the
petals
covered
with
water
from
the
fountain
a
task
for
poets
thought
shapur
as
he
began
what
more
delightful
than
to
stand
in
the
moonlighted
garden
and
pluck
the
velvet
leaves
but
after
awhile
the
thorns
tore
his
hands
and
the
rustle
and
hiss
underfoot
betrayed
the
presence
of
serpents
and
sleep
weighed
heavily
upon
his
eyelids
it
grew
monotonous
standing
hour
after
hour
stripping
the
from
the
calyxes
until
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
had
been
dropped
into
the
great
jars
the
very
sweetness
of
the
task
began
to
cloy
upon
him
the
stars
had
faded
and
the
east
begun
to
brighten
old
omar
came
out
tis
well
he
said
now
break
thy
fast
and
then
to
slumber
with
thee
to
prepare
for
another
sleepless
night
long
months
went
by
till
it
seemed
to
shapur
that
the
garden
must
surely
become
exhausted
but
for
every
rose
he
plucked
two
bloomed
in
its
stead
and
night
after
night
he
filled
the
jars
he
was
learning
no
secrets
and
he
asked
himself
questions
sometimes
was
he
not
wasting
his
life
would
it
not
have
been
better
to
have
waited
by
the
other
fountain
until
some
caravan
passed
by
that
would
carry
him
out
of
the
solitude
to
the
dwellings
of
men
what
opportunity
was
the
desert
offering
him
greater
than
kings
houses
could
give
ever
the
thorns
tore
him
more
sorely
and
the
lonely
silence
of
the
nights
weighed
upon
him
many
a
time
he
would
have
left
his
task
had
not
the
shadowy
form
of
his
camel
kneeling
outside
by
the
fountain
seemed
to
whisper
to
him
through
the
starlight
patience
shapur
patience
far
in
the
distance
he
saw
the
black
outline
of
a
distant
caravan
passing
along
the
horizon
where
day
was
beginning
to
break
he
did
no
more
work
until
it
had
passed
from
sight
gazing
after
it
with
a
fierce
longing
to
follow
he
pictured
the
scenes
it
was
moving
toward
the
gilded
minarets
of
the
mosques
the
ringing
of
bells
the
cries
of
the
populace
and
all
the
life
and
stir
of
the
when
the
shadowy
procession
had
passed
the
great
silence
of
the
desert
smote
him
like
a
pain
looking
out
he
saw
his
faithful
camel
and
again
it
seemed
to
whisper
patience
shapur
patience
so
thou
too
shalt
fare
forth
to
the
city
of
thy
desire
day
in
the
waning
of
summer
omar
called
him
into
a
room
in
which
he
had
never
been
before
now
at
last
said
he
hast
thou
proven
thyself
worthy
to
be
the
sharer
of
my
secrets
come
i
will
show
thee
thus
are
the
roses
distilled
and
thus
is
gathered
up
the
precious
oil
floating
on
the
tops
of
the
vessels
seest
thou
this
tiny
vial
it
weighs
but
the
weight
of
one
rupee
but
it
took
the
sweetness
of
two
hundred
thousand
roses
to
make
the
attar
it
contains
and
so
costly
is
it
that
only
princes
may
purchase
it
is
worth
more
than
thy
entire
load
of
salt
that
was
washed
away
at
the
fountain
worked
diligently
at
the
new
task
till
there
came
a
day
when
omar
said
to
him
well
done
shapur
behold
the
gift
of
the
desert
its
reward
for
thy
patient
service
in
its
solitude
placed
in
shapur
hands
a
crystal
vase
sealed
with
a
seal
and
filled
with
the
precious
attar
wherever
thou
goest
this
sweetness
will
open
for
thee
a
way
and
win
for
thee
a
welcome
thou
camest
into
the
desert
a
vender
of
salt
thou
shalt
go
forth
an
apostle
of
my
alchemy
wherever
thou
seest
a
heart
bowed
down
in
some
desert
of
waiting
thou
shalt
whisper
to
it
here
if
thou
wilt
in
these
arid
sands
thou
mayst
find
thy
garden
of
omar
and
from
these
daily
tasks
that
prick
thee
sorest
distil
some
precious
attar
to
sweeten
all
life
so
like
the
bee
that
led
thee
to
my
teaching
shalt
thou
lead
others
to
hope
shapur
went
forth
with
the
crystal
vase
and
his
camel
healed
in
the
long
time
of
waiting
bore
him
swiftly
across
the
sands
to
the
city
of
his
desire
the
golden
gate
that
would
not
have
opened
to
the
vender
of
salt
swung
wide
for
the
apostle
of
omar
brought
their
pearls
to
exchange
for
his
attar
and
everywhere
he
went
its
sweetness
opened
for
him
a
way
and
won
for
him
a
welcome
wherever
he
saw
a
heart
bowed
down
in
some
desert
of
waiting
he
whispered
omar
words
and
tarried
to
teach
omar
alchemy
that
from
the
commonest
experiences
of
life
may
be
distilled
its
greatest
blessings
his
death
in
order
that
men
might
not
forget
he
willed
that
his
tomb
should
be
made
at
a
place
where
all
caravans
passed
there
at
the
crossing
of
the
highways
he
caused
to
be
cut
in
stone
that
emblem
of
patience
the
camel
kneeling
on
the
sand
and
it
bore
this
inscription
which
no
one
could
fail
to
see
as
he
toiled
past
toward
the
city
of
his
desire
patience
here
if
thou
wilt
on
these
arid
sands
thou
mayst
find
thy
garden
of
omar
and
even
from
the
daily
tasks
which
prick
thee
sorest
mayst
distil
some
precious
attar
to
bless
thee
and
thy
fellow
man
thousand
moons
waxed
and
waned
above
it
then
a
thousand
thousand
more
and
there
arose
a
generation
with
restless
hearts
who
set
their
faces
ever
westward
following
the
sun
toward
a
greater
city
of
desire
strange
seas
they
crossed
new
coasts
they
came
upon
some
were
satisfied
with
the
fair
valleys
that
tempted
them
to
tarry
and
built
them
homes
where
the
fruitful
hills
whispered
stay
but
always
the
sons
of
shapur
pushed
ahead
to
pitch
their
tents
a
day
march
nearer
the
city
of
their
desire
nearer
the
golden
gate
which
opened
every
sunset
to
let
the
royal
rajah
of
the
day
pass
through
like
a
mirage
that
vision
lured
them
on
showing
them
a
dream
gate
of
opportunity
always
just
ahead
yet
ever
out
of
reach
in
the
days
of
shapur
so
it
was
in
the
days
of
his
sons
there
were
those
who
fell
by
the
way
and
losing
all
that
made
life
dear
cried
out
as
the
caravan
passed
on
without
them
that
allah
had
forgotten
them
and
they
cursed
the
day
that
they
were
born
and
laid
hopeless
heads
in
the
dust
allah
the
merciful
who
from
the
beginning
knew
what
desert
of
waiting
must
lie
between
every
son
of
shapur
and
the
city
of
his
desire
had
long
before
stretched
out
his
hand
over
one
of
the
mountains
of
his
continent
with
earthquake
shock
it
sank
before
him
with
countless
of
hail
and
and
with
gleaming
rills
he
chiselled
it
till
as
the
centuries
rolled
by
it
took
the
semblance
of
that
symbol
of
patience
a
camel
kneeling
there
at
the
passing
of
the
ways
and
to
every
heart
bowed
down
and
hopeless
it
whispers
daily
its
message
of
cheer
thou
camest
into
the
desert
a
vender
of
salt
thou
mayst
go
forth
an
alchemist
distilling
from
life
tasks
and
sorrows
such
precious
attar
in
thy
soul
that
its
sweetness
shall
win
for
thee
a
welcome
wherever
thou
goest
and
a
royal
entrance
into
the
city
of
thy
desire
there
was
a
long
silence
when
ellestad
closed
his
joyce
had
turned
her
face
away
to
watch
the
mountain
while
he
read
so
he
could
not
see
whether
the
little
tale
pleased
her
or
not
but
suddenly
a
tear
splashed
down
on
the
paper
in
her
lap
and
she
drew
her
hand
hastily
across
her
eyes
you
see
it
seems
as
if
you
written
that
just
for
me
she
said
trying
to
laugh
i
think
it
beautiful
if
ever
there
was
a
heart
bowed
down
in
a
desert
of
waiting
i
was
that
one
when
i
came
out
here
this
afternoon
but
you
have
given
a
new
meaning
to
the
mountain
ellestad
how
did
you
ever
happen
to
think
of
it
all
a
line
from
sadi
one
of
the
persian
poets
started
me
he
answered
alchemist
contentment
it
grew
out
of
that
that
and
my
own
unrest
and
despondency
look
she
cried
excitedly
do
you
see
that
a
bee
a
bee
buzzing
around
my
head
as
it
did
shapur
and
i
ca
drive
him
away
she
flapped
at
it
with
her
handkerchief
oh
there
it
goes
now
i
wonder
where
it
would
lead
us
if
we
could
follow
it
probably
to
some
neighbour
almond
orchard
answered
ellestad
oh
dear
sighed
joyce
i
wish
that
there
was
a
bee
that
i
could
follow
and
a
real
rose
garden
that
i
could
find
it
sounds
so
beautiful
and
easy
to
say
of
life
tasks
and
sorrows
distil
a
precious
attar
in
thy
soul
and
i
like
to
heaven
knows
but
when
it
comes
to
the
point
how
is
one
actually
to
go
about
it
if
it
were
something
that
i
could
do
with
my
hands
i
attempt
it
gladly
no
matter
how
hard
but
doing
the
things
in
an
allegory
is
like
trying
to
take
hold
of
the
girl
in
the
mirror
you
can
see
her
plainly
enough
but
you
ca
touch
her
i
used
to
feel
that
way
about
progress
and
think
that
if
i
only
had
a
real
pack
on
my
back
as
christian
had
and
could
start
off
on
a
real
road
that
i
could
be
sure
of
what
i
was
doing
and
the
progress
i
was
making
i
wish
you
tell
me
how
to
begin
really
living
up
to
your
legend
she
spoke
lightly
but
there
was
a
wistful
glance
in
the
laughing
eyes
she
turned
toward
him
you
will
first
have
to
tell
me
what
is
the
city
of
your
desire
oh
to
be
an
artist
it
has
always
been
that
to
paint
beautiful
pictures
that
will
live
long
after
i
am
gone
and
will
make
people
better
and
happier
then
the
work
itself
would
be
such
a
joy
to
me
ever
since
i
have
been
old
enough
to
realize
that
i
will
have
to
do
something
to
earn
my
own
living
i
hoped
that
i
could
do
it
in
that
way
i
have
had
lessons
from
the
best
teachers
we
could
get
in
plainsville
and
cousin
kate
took
me
to
the
finest
art
galleries
in
europe
and
promised
to
send
me
to
the
art
league
in
new
york
if
i
finished
my
high
school
course
creditably
but
we
had
to
come
out
here
and
that
ended
everything
i
ca
help
saying
like
shapur
should
i
with
life
beating
strong
in
my
veins
and
ambition
like
a
burning
simoom
in
my
breast
be
left
here
helpless
on
the
sands
where
i
can
achieve
nothing
and
make
no
progress
toward
the
city
of
my
desire
it
seems
especially
hard
to
have
all
this
precious
time
wasted
when
i
had
counted
so
much
on
the
money
i
expected
to
earn
enough
to
keep
mamma
comfortable
when
she
grows
old
and
to
give
the
other
children
all
sorts
of
advantages
and
you
do
not
believe
that
these
sands
hold
anything
for
you
said
ellestad
joyce
shook
her
head
it
takes
something
more
than
a
trained
hand
and
a
disciplined
eye
to
make
an
artist
he
answered
slowly
did
you
ever
think
that
it
is
the
soul
that
has
to
be
educated
that
the
greater
the
man
behind
the
brush
the
greater
the
picture
will
be
moses
had
his
midian
before
he
was
worthy
to
be
to
his
people
israel
had
forty
years
of
before
it
was
fit
for
its
promised
land
david
was
trained
for
kingship
not
in
courts
but
on
the
hillsides
with
his
flocks
this
is
the
secret
of
omar
alchemy
to
gather
something
from
every
person
we
meet
from
every
experience
life
brings
us
as
omar
gathered
something
from
the
heart
of
every
rose
and
out
of
the
wide
knowledge
thus
gained
of
human
weaknesses
and
human
needs
to
distil
in
our
own
hearts
the
precious
oil
of
sympathy
that
is
the
attar
that
will
win
for
us
a
welcome
wherever
we
go
sympathy
the
quick
insight
and
deep
understanding
that
help
us
to
interpret
people
and
nobody
fills
his
crystal
vase
with
it
until
he
has
been
pricked
by
the
disappointments
and
bowed
by
its
tasks
no
masterpiece
was
ever
painted
without
it
a
man
may
become
a
fine
copyist
but
he
can
never
make
anything
live
on
canvas
until
he
has
first
lived
deeply
himself
do
not
think
your
days
wasted
little
friend
where
could
you
learn
such
lessons
of
patience
and
courage
as
here
on
this
desert
where
so
many
come
to
die
where
could
you
grow
stronger
than
in
the
faithful
doing
of
your
commonplace
duties
here
at
home
where
they
all
need
you
and
lean
upon
you
you
do
not
realize
that
if
you
could
go
on
now
to
the
city
of
your
desire
the
little
you
have
to
offer
the
world
would
put
you
in
the
rank
of
a
common
vender
of
salt
you
could
only
follow
in
the
train
of
others
is
not
waiting
worth
while
if
it
shall
give
you
wares
with
which
to
win
a
entrance
oh
yes
answered
joyce
in
a
quick
as
the
musical
voice
paused
she
was
looking
away
toward
the
mountain
with
a
rapt
expression
on
her
uplifted
face
as
of
one
who
sees
visions
all
the
discontent
had
vanished
now
it
was
glowing
with
hope
and
purpose
as
ellestad
rose
to
go
she
turned
impulsively
to
thrust
both
outstretched
hands
into
his
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
she
exclaimed
old
camelback
will
be
a
constant
inspiration
to
me
after
this
instead
of
an
emblem
of
hopelessness
come
in
and
read
the
legend
to
mamma
and
may
i
copy
it
sometime
always
now
i
shall
think
of
you
as
i
shall
call
you
that
in
my
thoughts
thank
you
little
friend
he
said
softly
as
they
walked
on
toward
the
house
i
have
failed
to
accomplish
many
things
in
life
that
i
had
hoped
to
do
but
the
thought
that
one
discouraged
soul
has
called
me
its
omar
makes
me
feel
that
i
have
not
lived
wholly
in
vain
chapter
ix
lloyd
duck
hunt
meanwhile
lloyd
and
jack
riding
along
toward
the
river
were
enjoying
every
moment
of
the
sunny
afternoon
leaving
the
road
at
the
white
bachelor
they
followed
the
trail
across
a
strip
of
desert
illustration
enjoying
every
moment
of
the
sunny
afternoon
look
out
for
gopher
holes
called
jack
if
your
horse
should
happen
to
stumble
into
one
you
be
over
his
head
before
you
can
say
the
little
pests
burrow
everywhere
as
he
spoke
his
pony
sprang
to
one
side
of
the
road
with
a
suddenness
that
nearly
threw
him
from
the
saddle
you
old
goose
he
exclaimed
that
was
nothing
but
a
stick
you
shied
at
but
it
does
look
remarkably
like
a
snake
does
it
lloyd
the
way
with
all
these
ponies
they
always
on
the
watch
for
rattlers
and
they
shy
at
anything
that
looks
the
least
bit
like
one
i
did
know
that
we
find
snakes
out
heah
in
this
dry
sand
said
lloyd
in
surprise
yes
you
find
almost
anything
if
you
know
just
where
to
look
a
whole
menagerie
there
are
owls
and
snakes
living
together
in
the
same
holes
wait
it
looks
as
if
there
might
be
a
nest
of
them
yonder
stir
it
up
and
see
leaving
the
trail
he
rode
up
between
a
clump
of
and
greasewood
bushes
and
threw
his
hat
with
all
his
force
toward
a
hole
beneath
them
a
great
sleepy
owl
fluttered
out
and
sailed
off
with
a
slow
flapping
of
wings
to
the
shelter
of
a
stubby
mesquit
farther
on
if
we
had
time
to
dig
into
the
nest
we
find
a
snake
in
there
declared
jack
hanging
down
from
his
saddle
cowboy
fashion
to
pick
up
his
hat
from
the
ground
as
he
rode
along
he
could
feel
that
lloyd
admired
the
easy
grace
with
which
he
did
it
and
that
she
was
interested
in
the
strange
things
he
had
to
tell
about
the
desert
he
was
glad
that
phil
was
not
along
for
phil
with
his
three
years
advantage
in
age
and
six
inches
in
height
had
a
way
of
monopolizing
attention
that
made
jack
appear
very
young
and
insignificant
he
resented
being
made
to
feel
like
a
little
boy
when
he
was
almost
a
year
older
than
lloyd
and
several
inches
taller
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
been
out
alone
with
her
and
the
first
time
that
he
had
had
a
chance
to
show
her
that
he
could
be
entertaining
when
he
tried
joyce
and
mary
and
phil
had
always
had
so
much
to
say
that
he
had
kept
in
the
background
the
sun
on
lloyd
hair
made
it
gleam
like
sunshine
itself
tucked
up
under
her
jaunty
little
the
exercise
was
bringing
a
deeper
colour
to
the
delicate
pink
of
her
cheeks
and
as
her
eyes
smiled
mischievously
up
at
him
whenever
he
told
some
tale
that
seemed
almost
too
big
to
believe
he
decided
that
she
was
quite
the
nicest
girl
he
had
ever
known
except
joyce
and
fully
as
agreeable
to
go
hunting
with
as
any
boy
in
that
short
trip
he
pointed
out
more
strange
things
than
she
could
have
seen
in
a
whole
afternoon
in
the
streets
of
paris
or
london
there
were
the
wonderful
tiny
leading
down
into
the
tunnels
of
the
cunning
spiders
the
hairy
tarantulas
the
lizards
the
burrows
of
the
a
trail
made
by
the
feet
of
coyotes
on
their
way
to
the
white
bachelor
then
he
pointed
out
a
great
cactus
sixty
feet
high
branched
like
a
candelabrum
and
told
her
that
the
thorny
trunk
is
like
a
great
sealed
cup
full
of
the
purest
water
and
that
more
than
one
traveller
has
saved
his
life
by
boring
into
one
of
these
desert
wells
when
he
was
perishing
of
thirst
he
told
her
how
the
navajo
indians
hunt
the
sticking
up
a
piece
of
mirror
at
the
entrance
to
the
mound
and
lying
in
wait
for
the
little
creature
to
come
out
when
it
meets
its
own
reflection
and
sees
what
it
supposes
to
be
a
strange
mocking
it
at
its
own
front
door
it
hurries
out
to
fight
and
the
indian
pins
it
to
the
ground
with
his
arrow
now
we
have
to
go
faster
and
make
up
for
lost
time
he
exclaimed
as
they
left
the
desert
and
turned
into
a
road
leading
to
tempe
a
little
town
several
miles
away
on
salt
river
there
is
an
old
ruin
near
this
road
where
the
indians
had
a
fort
of
some
kind
that
i
like
to
show
you
but
it
getting
late
and
we
better
hurry
on
to
the
river
let
gallop
lloyd
had
enjoyed
many
a
swift
ride
but
none
that
had
been
so
exhilarating
as
this
the
pure
fresh
air
blowing
over
the
desert
was
unlike
any
she
had
ever
breathed
before
it
seemed
so
much
purer
and
more
it
was
a
joy
just
to
be
alive
on
such
a
day
and
in
such
a
place
she
felt
that
she
knew
some
of
the
delight
a
bird
must
feel
winging
its
wild
free
way
through
the
trackless
sky
i
like
to
show
you
the
town
too
jack
said
as
they
came
to
the
ford
in
the
river
leading
over
to
tempe
the
mexican
quarter
is
so
but
as
we
out
to
kill
we
just
keep
on
this
side
and
follow
the
river
a
piece
chris
said
that
is
where
he
saw
the
ducks
oh
i
be
the
proudest
thing
that
evah
walked
she
exclaimed
if
i
could
only
shoot
one
a
peacock
could
hold
a
candle
to
me
it
would
be
worth
the
trip
to
arizona
just
to
do
that
if
i
nevah
did
anothah
thing
how
i
could
crow
ovah
malcolm
and
rob
oh
jack
you
have
any
idea
how
much
i
want
to
you
shall
have
first
pop
at
them
jack
answered
you
do
stand
as
good
a
show
with
that
little
rifle
as
i
do
you
have
to
wait
till
you
get
up
just
as
close
as
possible
compared
to
the
broad
ohio
which
lloyd
was
accustomed
to
seeing
salt
river
did
not
look
much
wider
than
a
creek
she
was
in
a
quiver
of
excitement
when
they
turned
the
bend
and
suddenly
came
in
sight
of
the
beautiful
the
ponies
trained
to
stand
perfectly
still
wherever
they
were
left
came
to
a
sudden
halt
as
the
two
excited
hunters
sprang
off
and
crept
stealthily
along
the
bank
they
see
your
white
sweater
cautioned
jack
stoop
down
and
sneak
in
behind
the
bushes
then
i
bettah
wait
heah
returned
lloyd
and
you
go
on
i
believe
i
could
hit
a
bahn
doah
now
i
in
such
a
shake
i
must
have
the
ague
if
i
bang
into
them
i
just
frighten
them
all
away
and
you
wo
get
a
shot
it
was
a
temptation
to
jack
to
do
as
she
urged
this
was
the
first
sight
he
had
had
of
a
duck
since
he
had
owned
a
gun
and
the
glint
of
the
iridescent
feathers
as
the
pretty
creatures
circled
and
dived
in
the
water
made
him
tingle
with
the
hunters
thrill
no
he
exclaimed
as
she
insisted
i
brought
you
out
here
to
shoot
a
duck
and
i
do
want
to
take
you
back
without
one
then
i
get
down
and
wiggle
along
in
the
sand
so
they
ca
see
me
said
lloyd
just
like
dick
the
huntah
is
this
fun
crawling
stealthily
through
the
greasewood
bushes
they
crept
inch
by
inch
nearer
the
water
fairly
holding
their
breath
with
excitement
then
lloyd
rising
to
her
knees
levelled
her
rifle
to
take
aim
but
her
hands
shook
and
lowering
it
she
turned
to
jack
whispering
i
suah
i
miss
and
spoil
yoah
chance
you
shoot
aw
go
on
said
jack
roughly
forgetting
in
his
excitement
that
he
was
not
speaking
to
a
boy
do
be
a
goose
you
can
hit
one
if
you
try
the
commanding
tone
irritated
lloyd
but
it
seemed
to
steady
her
nerves
for
flashing
an
indignant
glance
at
him
she
raised
her
rifle
again
and
aimed
it
with
deliberate
coolness
jack
who
knelt
just
beside
her
prepared
to
fire
the
instant
her
shot
should
send
a
whir
of
wings
into
the
air
gave
a
wild
whoop
and
dropped
his
gun
hi
he
yelled
you
hit
it
see
it
floating
over
there
wait
a
minute
i
get
it
for
you
crashing
through
the
bushes
he
ran
back
to
where
washington
stood
waiting
and
swinging
himself
into
the
saddle
spurred
him
down
the
bank
but
the
pony
who
had
never
balked
before
with
him
at
any
ford
seemed
unwilling
to
go
in
hurry
up
you
old
called
jack
do
you
see
it
getting
away
he
succeeded
in
urging
him
into
the
middle
of
the
river
where
the
water
was
almost
up
to
the
pony
body
but
across
the
pony
began
to
plunge
and
turned
abruptly
about
then
his
hind
feet
seemed
to
give
way
and
he
went
suddenly
back
on
his
haunches
at
the
same
instant
a
gruff
voice
called
from
the
bank
come
out
of
that
you
little
fool
do
you
know
there
quicksand
there
head
your
cayuse
down
the
river
quick
spur
him
up
do
you
want
to
drown
yourself
with
a
desperate
plunge
and
a
flounder
or
two
the
pony
freed
himself
and
struggled
back
to
safe
ground
past
the
treacherous
quicksand
as
jack
reached
the
bank
he
saw
the
white
bachelor
peering
at
him
from
the
back
of
his
white
horse
he
was
evidently
on
the
same
mission
for
he
wore
a
as
brown
and
as
his
swarthy
face
and
carried
an
old
gun
on
his
shoulder
you
have
been
sucked
clean
through
to
china
if
you
gone
much
farther
over
he
said
crossly
that
one
of
the
worst
places
in
the
river
although
his
tone
was
savage
there
was
a
pleasant
gleam
in
his
eyes
as
he
added
too
bad
you
lost
your
duck
have
lost
it
yet
said
jack
with
a
glance
toward
the
dark
object
floating
rapidly
he
kicked
off
his
boots
as
he
spoke
oh
jack
please
do
go
in
after
it
begged
lloyd
it
is
worth
such
a
risk
the
word
quicksand
had
frightened
her
for
she
had
heard
much
of
the
dangerous
spots
in
the
rivers
of
this
region
bound
to
have
it
called
jack
for
you
might
not
get
another
shot
and
i
bound
not
to
take
you
back
home
without
one
striking
out
into
the
water
regardless
of
his
sweater
and
heavy
corduroy
trousers
he
paddled
after
it
by
this
time
the
entire
flock
was
out
of
sight
and
when
jack
emerged
from
the
river
dripping
like
a
the
man
remarked
coolly
well
your
hunt
up
for
this
day
buddy
better
skip
home
and
hang
yourself
up
to
dry
or
you
be
having
pneumonia
are
you
one
of
the
kids
that
lives
at
that
place
where
they
got
ware
wigwam
painted
on
the
post
and
all
sorts
of
outlandish
figgers
on
the
tents
yes
acknowledged
jack
in
a
surly
tone
resenting
the
name
kid
then
remembering
the
fate
that
the
man
warning
had
saved
him
from
he
added
gratefully
it
was
lucky
for
me
you
yelled
out
quicksand
just
when
you
did
for
i
was
so
bent
on
getting
that
duck
that
i
have
kept
on
trying
no
matter
how
the
pony
cut
up
i
thought
he
had
taken
a
stubborn
spell
and
wanted
to
balk
at
the
water
i
a
thousand
times
obliged
here
lloyd
he
added
here
your
trophy
we
hang
it
on
your
saddle
he
held
out
the
fowl
a
beautifully
marked
drake
but
she
drew
back
with
a
little
shrug
of
the
shoulders
oh
mercy
no
she
answered
i
would
touch
it
for
the
world
haw
haw
roared
the
white
bachelor
who
had
watched
her
shrinking
gesture
with
a
grin
afraid
of
a
dead
duck
i
not
she
declared
turning
on
him
indignantly
i
not
afraid
of
anything
but
i
just
ca
beah
to
touch
dead
things
especially
with
or
feathahs
on
them
ugh
it
neahly
makes
me
sick
to
think
about
it
well
if
that
do
beat
the
dutch
said
the
man
in
an
amused
tone
after
a
long
stare
she
seemed
to
be
a
strange
species
of
womankind
with
which
he
was
unacquainted
then
after
another
prolonged
stare
he
swung
his
heels
against
the
sides
of
his
old
white
horse
as
a
signal
to
move
and
ambled
slowly
off
talking
to
himself
as
he
went
meddlesome
old
thing
muttered
lloyd
casting
an
indignant
glance
after
him
it
none
of
his
business
i
do
see
what
he
wanted
to
poke
in
for
it
was
lucky
for
me
that
he
did
answered
jack
i
never
once
thought
of
quicksand
queer
that
i
did
too
when
i
heard
so
much
about
it
ever
since
i
came
it
all
through
southern
arizona
and
more
than
one
man
has
lost
his
life
blundering
into
it
lloyd
grew
serious
as
she
realized
the
danger
he
had
escaped
it
was
mighty
brave
of
you
to
go
back
into
the
rivah
aftah
you
came
so
neah
being
drowned
and
just
fo
my
pleasuah
just
because
you
knew
i
wanted
that
duck
i
remembah
it
always
of
you
jack
oh
that
nothing
he
answered
carelessly
blushing
to
the
roots
of
his
wet
hair
when
i
once
start
out
to
get
a
thing
i
hate
to
be
beaten
i
have
swam
all
the
way
to
jericho
rather
than
let
it
get
away
but
i
hope
you
wo
always
think
of
me
as
sloshing
around
in
the
water
though
i
suppose
you
ca
help
that
for
you
know
the
first
time
you
saw
me
i
was
over
my
elbows
in
a
washtub
that
so
laughed
lloyd
but
you
were
quite
as
wet
then
as
you
are
now
it
a
pity
you
ca
wring
yourself
as
dry
as
you
did
those
towels
while
jack
was
tugging
into
his
boots
she
went
back
to
the
bushes
for
the
gun
he
had
dropped
then
she
stood
drawing
out
the
loads
while
he
tied
the
duck
to
his
saddle
poah
thing
said
lloyd
it
looked
so
beautiful
swimming
around
in
the
watah
a
few
minutes
ago
now
it
mate
will
be
so
lonesome
papa
jack
says
wild
ducks
nevah
mate
again
of
she
went
on
slowly
proud
to
think
that
i
hit
it
but
now
that
it
dead
and
i
took
life
i
feel
like
a
murdahah
jack
i
nevah
going
to
kill
anothah
one
as
long
as
i
live
but
it
is
as
if
you
done
it
just
for
sport
protested
jack
they
were
meant
for
food
wait
till
joyce
serves
it
for
dinner
and
change
your
mind
no
she
said
resolutely
i
keep
my
rifle
for
rattlesnakes
and
coyotes
in
case
i
see
any
and
for
practice
but
i
not
going
to
do
any
moah
killing
of
this
kind
i
glad
that
i
got
this
one
though
she
added
as
she
swung
herself
into
the
saddle
i
send
grandfathah
a
feathah
and
one
to
mom
beck
they
both
be
so
proud
and
i
send
one
to
malcolm
and
one
to
rob
and
they
both
be
so
envious
to
think
that
i
got
ahead
of
them
may
i
have
one
asked
jack
just
to
keep
to
remember
my
first
duck
hunt
yes
of
cried
lloyd
i
would
have
had
any
myself
if
it
had
been
for
you
you
have
given
me
one
of
the
greatest
pleasuahs
i
evah
had
this
has
been
a
lovely
aftahnoon
then
i
can
count
that
quite
a
in
my
cap
ca
i
said
jack
laughingly
reaching
down
he
selected
the
prettiest
feather
he
could
find
and
thrust
the
long
quill
through
his
hatband
lloyd
glanced
quickly
at
him
she
would
have
expected
such
a
complimentary
speech
from
malcolm
or
phil
but
coming
from
the
quiet
jack
such
a
graceful
bit
of
gallantry
was
a
surprise
you
can
save
the
down
for
a
you
know
he
added
even
if
you
have
sworn
off
shooting
any
more
yourself
you
can
levy
on
all
that
phil
and
i
get
to
finish
it
oh
thank
you
she
called
back
over
her
shoulder
her
pony
finding
that
he
was
turned
homeward
was
setting
off
at
his
best
gait
slapping
his
hat
firmly
on
his
head
jack
hurried
to
overtake
her
and
the
two
raced
along
neck
to
neck
this
is
how
they
brought
the
good
news
from
ghent
to
aix
he
called
i
recited
it
once
at
school
a
word
to
each
other
we
kept
the
great
pace
neck
by
neck
stride
by
stride
never
changing
our
place
is
it
glorious
called
back
lloyd
her
cheeks
dimpled
with
pleasure
and
were
growing
red
as
a
peach
from
the
exercise
her
began
slipping
out
snatching
at
the
little
cap
she
caught
it
just
in
time
to
save
it
from
sailing
off
into
the
desert
but
her
hair
came
slipping
down
over
her
shoulders
to
her
waist
in
soft
shining
waves
jack
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
anything
prettier
than
the
little
golden
ripples
in
it
as
it
floated
back
behind
her
in
the
sunshine
you
look
like
goldilocks
when
the
three
bears
chased
her
he
laughed
do
try
to
put
it
up
again
that
squaw
fashion
you
ought
to
wear
it
that
way
all
the
time
you
out
here
if
you
want
to
be
in
style
across
the
road
from
the
wigwam
mary
and
norman
were
waiting
for
the
return
of
the
hunters
they
had
rolled
a
barrel
from
the
back
yard
over
to
the
edge
of
the
desert
where
they
could
watch
the
road
and
turning
it
on
its
side
had
laid
a
plank
across
it
left
from
flooring
the
tents
on
this
they
were
seesawing
up
and
down
taking
turns
at
occupying
the
end
which
faced
in
the
direction
jack
and
lloyd
would
come
mary
happened
to
have
the
coveted
seat
when
they
came
in
sight
gay
go
up
and
gay
go
down
she
chanted
as
the
seesaw
rose
and
fell
with
delightful
springiness
all
the
way
to
london
town
norman
was
high
in
the
air
when
she
began
again
gay
go
up
but
it
was
anything
but
gay
go
down
for
norman
with
an
unexpectedness
that
he
was
wholly
unprepared
for
mary
chant
ended
with
a
whoop
of
here
they
come
she
sprang
off
and
ran
to
meet
them
regardless
of
the
other
end
of
the
plank
it
fell
with
such
a
thud
that
norman
felt
that
his
spinal
column
must
certainly
have
become
unjointed
in
the
jolt
and
his
little
white
teeth
shut
down
violently
on
his
little
red
tongue
his
cries
and
mary
shout
of
here
they
come
brought
joyce
to
the
door
ellestad
was
just
leaving
she
had
prevailed
upon
him
to
read
the
legend
to
her
mother
and
then
he
had
stayed
on
till
sundown
discussing
the
different
things
that
a
girl
might
do
on
the
desert
to
earn
money
the
story
of
shapur
had
inspired
her
with
a
hope
that
made
all
things
possible
she
was
glad
that
lloyd
triumph
gave
her
an
outlet
for
her
enthusiasm
as
soon
as
ellestad
left
she
hustled
jack
off
to
his
mother
tent
to
change
his
wet
clothes
and
then
started
to
build
the
fire
for
supper
it
a
pity
that
it
too
dark
for
me
to
take
a
snap
shot
of
you
with
that
duck
she
said
but
the
first
one
that
jack
or
phil
kills
we
have
a
picture
of
it
it
will
do
just
as
well
then
if
i
were
you
i
make
some
little
of
white
put
a
on
the
top
sheet
of
you
and
your
rifle
and
the
duck
and
at
the
top
fasten
one
of
the
feathers
made
into
a
pen
you
can
split
the
end
of
the
quill
you
know
just
as
they
used
to
make
the
pens
so
i
can
cried
lloyd
i
so
glad
you
thought
of
it
oh
joyce
had
the
best
time
this
aftahnoon
i
had
no
idea
the
desert
could
be
so
interesting
nor
i
either
began
joyce
i
tell
you
about
it
some
other
time
she
added
as
holland
burst
in
demanding
to
see
the
duck
that
lloyd
had
killed
mary
had
run
down
the
road
to
meet
him
with
the
news
but
he
stoutly
declined
to
believe
that
a
girl
could
have
accomplished
such
a
feat
until
he
had
the
proof
of
it
in
his
hands
then
to
delight
he
claimed
the
honour
of
picking
it
she
felt
that
she
would
rather
throw
it
away
than
go
through
the
ordeal
herself
yet
she
could
not
impose
such
a
task
on
any
one
else
at
such
a
late
hour
on
a
busy
saturday
oh
if
you
only
will
she
cried
i
let
you
use
my
rifle
all
next
saturday
i
did
see
how
i
could
possibly
touch
it
that
down
is
so
thick
undah
the
long
outside
feathahs
that
it
would
be
as
bad
as
picking
a
a
holland
ripped
out
a
handful
with
a
look
of
fine
scorn
well
if
you
are
the
funniest
he
exclaimed
girls
are
awful
finicky
he
confided
to
mary
later
i
glad
that
i
not
one
chapter
x
the
school
of
the
bees
with
her
slipper
toes
caught
in
the
meshes
of
the
hammock
to
keep
her
from
falling
out
and
with
her
head
hanging
over
nearly
to
the
ground
mary
lay
watching
something
beneath
her
with
breathless
interest
what
is
it
mary
called
phil
as
he
came
up
and
threw
himself
down
on
the
grass
beside
her
in
the
shade
of
the
bushy
she
pointed
to
a
saucer
of
sugar
and
water
just
below
her
on
the
edge
of
which
several
bees
had
alighted
i
put
it
there
she
said
in
a
low
tone
as
if
afraid
of
disturbing
the
bees
ellestad
has
been
telling
us
how
smart
they
are
and
i
wanted
to
watch
them
do
some
of
their
strange
things
myself
he
wants
joyce
to
raise
bees
instead
of
chickens
or
squabs
or
any
of
the
things
they
were
talking
about
doing
he
came
up
after
dinner
with
some
books
and
told
us
so
much
about
them
that
i
learned
more
than
i
would
in
a
whole
week
in
school
joyce
and
lloyd
were
so
interested
that
as
soon
as
he
left
they
rode
right
over
to
shaw
bee
ranch
to
find
out
how
much
a
hive
costs
and
all
about
it
have
they
been
gone
long
asked
phil
more
interested
in
the
girls
than
in
the
bees
finding
that
they
had
been
away
more
than
an
hour
and
that
it
was
almost
time
for
their
return
he
settled
himself
to
wait
feigning
an
interest
almost
as
great
as
mary
in
the
saucer
of
sugar
and
water
there
was
something
comical
to
him
always
in
mary
serious
moods
and
the
grave
expression
of
the
little
round
face
as
it
hung
over
the
edge
of
the
hammock
promised
enough
amusement
to
make
the
time
pass
agreeably
when
one
bee
gets
all
he
can
carry
he
goes
and
tells
the
others
explained
mary
i
had
six
so
far
i
suppose
you
know
about
huber
she
asked
looking
up
eagerly
i
did
till
ellestad
read
us
a
lot
about
him
out
of
one
of
the
books
he
brought
i
heard
of
him
answered
phil
smiling
as
he
saw
how
much
she
wanted
the
pleasure
of
repeating
her
newly
gained
knowledge
suppose
you
tell
me
well
he
was
born
in
switzerland
in
geneva
and
when
lloyd
found
that
out
she
was
ready
to
read
anything
he
had
written
or
to
study
anything
he
was
interested
in
she
just
loves
geneva
that
was
where
she
met
the
major
who
gave
her
hero
her
red
cross
you
know
and
that
is
where
he
saved
her
life
by
stopping
a
runaway
horse
well
huber
went
blind
when
he
was
just
a
boy
and
he
would
have
had
a
terribly
lonesome
time
if
it
had
been
for
the
bees
he
began
to
study
them
and
they
were
so
interesting
that
he
went
on
studying
them
his
whole
life
he
had
somebody
to
help
him
of
course
who
watched
the
hives
and
told
him
what
went
on
inside
and
he
found
out
more
about
them
than
anybody
had
ever
done
before
and
wrote
books
about
them
it
is
two
hundred
years
since
then
and
a
whole
library
has
been
written
about
bees
since
then
but
his
books
are
still
read
and
considered
among
the
best
holland
said
pooh
the
bees
could
teach
anything
he
just
as
soon
go
to
a
school
of
grasshoppers
and
that
i
be
a
goose
if
i
spent
my
time
watching
eat
sugar
and
water
out
of
a
dish
he
was
going
off
fishing
with
george
lee
he
would
wait
to
hear
what
ellestad
had
to
say
but
all
the
fish
in
the
canal
would
do
me
as
much
good
as
one
thing
i
learned
from
the
bees
what
was
that
asked
phil
lazily
stretching
himself
out
full
length
on
the
grass
and
pulling
his
hat
over
his
eyes
sometimes
it
happens
that
something
gets
into
the
hives
that
belong
there
like
a
slug
once
a
mouse
got
in
one
and
it
told
in
the
book
about
a
child
dropping
a
snail
in
one
well
the
bees
can
sting
such
things
to
death
but
they
not
strong
enough
to
drag
them
out
after
they
dead
and
if
the
dead
bodies
stayed
in
the
hives
spoil
everything
after
awhile
so
the
bees
just
cover
them
all
over
with
wax
make
an
cell
and
seal
them
up
in
it
is
that
smart
then
they
just
leave
it
there
and
go
off
about
their
business
and
forget
about
it
ellestad
said
that
what
people
ought
to
do
with
their
troubles
that
ca
be
cured
but
have
to
be
endured
they
ought
to
seal
them
up
tight
and
stop
talking
and
fretting
about
them
keep
them
away
from
the
air
he
said
seal
them
up
so
they
wo
poison
their
whole
life
that
set
me
to
thinking
about
the
trouble
that
is
poisoning
my
happiness
and
i
made
up
my
mind
i
pretend
it
was
just
a
snail
that
had
crept
into
my
hive
i
ca
change
it
i
ca
drag
it
out
but
i
wo
let
it
spoil
all
my
honey
well
bless
my
soul
exclaimed
phil
sitting
up
very
straight
and
looking
at
her
with
an
interest
that
was
unfeigned
this
time
what
trouble
can
a
child
like
you
have
that
is
so
bad
as
all
that
wo
you
ever
tell
said
mary
and
wo
you
ever
laugh
at
me
she
was
eager
to
unburden
her
soul
but
afraid
of
appearing
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
her
hero
well
it
being
so
fat
i
always
wanted
to
be
tall
and
slender
and
willowy
like
the
girls
in
books
i
always
play
i
am
when
patty
and
i
go
off
by
ourselves
at
recess
i
have
such
good
times
then
but
when
i
come
back
the
boys
call
me
pudding
and
mother
bunch
and
i
think
that
is
spanish
for
my
face
is
just
as
round
as
a
full
moon
and
my
waist
well
holland
calls
me
and
that
indian
for
there
is
a
girl
in
school
that
has
such
legs
as
mine
i
can
barely
reach
around
them
with
both
hands
she
pulled
her
short
gingham
skirt
farther
over
her
knees
as
she
spoke
and
stole
a
side
glance
at
phil
to
see
if
he
were
taking
as
serious
a
view
of
her
troubles
as
the
situation
demanded
he
was
staring
straight
ahead
of
him
with
a
very
grave
face
for
he
had
to
draw
it
into
a
frown
to
keep
from
laughing
outright
i
give
anything
to
be
like
lloyd
she
continued
she
so
straight
and
graceful
and
she
holds
her
head
like
a
real
princess
but
she
grew
up
that
way
i
suppose
and
never
did
have
a
time
of
being
dumpy
like
me
they
used
to
call
her
fairy
lillian
when
she
was
little
because
she
was
so
light
on
her
feet
they
might
well
call
her
that
now
remarked
phil
looking
toward
the
road
down
which
she
was
to
appear
mary
about
to
plunge
into
deeper
confidences
saw
the
glance
and
saw
that
he
had
shifted
his
position
in
order
to
watch
for
the
coming
of
the
girls
she
felt
that
he
was
not
as
interested
as
she
had
supposed
maybe
he
would
care
to
hear
how
she
stood
every
day
in
the
tent
before
the
mirror
to
hold
her
shoulders
as
lloyd
did
or
throw
back
her
head
in
the
same
spirited
way
maybe
he
would
understand
maybe
he
would
think
her
vain
and
silly
and
a
as
holland
called
her
lloyd
would
not
have
rattled
on
the
way
she
had
been
doing
oh
why
had
she
been
born
with
such
a
runaway
tongue
covered
with
confusion
she
sat
so
long
without
speaking
that
phil
glanced
at
her
wondering
at
the
unusual
silence
to
his
surprise
there
was
an
expression
of
real
distress
on
the
plump
little
face
and
the
gray
eyes
were
winking
hard
to
keep
back
the
tears
so
that
is
the
trouble
is
it
he
said
kindly
not
knowing
what
was
in
her
thought
well
it
a
trouble
you
probably
outgrow
i
used
to
go
to
school
with
a
girl
that
was
nicknamed
jumbo
because
she
weighed
so
much
and
she
grew
up
to
be
as
tall
and
slim
as
a
rail
so
you
see
there
is
hope
for
you
in
the
meantime
you
are
a
very
sensible
little
girl
to
take
the
lesson
of
the
bees
to
heart
just
seal
up
your
trouble
and
do
bother
your
head
about
it
and
be
your
own
cheerful
happy
little
self
people
ca
help
loving
you
when
you
are
that
way
and
they
do
want
you
to
be
one
mite
different
phil
felt
like
a
grandfather
as
he
gave
this
bit
of
advice
he
did
not
see
the
look
of
supreme
happiness
which
crossed
mary
face
for
at
that
moment
the
girls
came
riding
up
to
the
house
and
he
sprang
up
to
meet
them
i
unsaddle
the
ponies
he
said
taking
the
bridles
as
the
girls
slid
to
the
ground
and
starting
toward
the
pasture
by
the
time
he
returned
mary
had
carried
some
chairs
out
to
the
hammock
and
joyce
had
brought
a
pitcher
of
lemonade
come
drink
to
the
success
of
my
new
undertaking
she
called
all
so
far
off
in
the
future
that
mamma
says
i
counting
my
chickens
before
they
are
hatched
but
i
going
into
the
bee
business
phil
shaw
will
let
me
have
a
hive
of
italian
bees
for
eight
dollars
i
do
know
when
i
ever
earn
that
much
money
but
i
do
it
some
day
then
that
hive
will
swarm
and
the
new
swarms
will
swarm
and
with
the
honey
they
make
i
buy
more
hives
there
is
such
a
long
time
every
year
in
this
land
of
flowers
that
i
be
owning
a
ranch
as
big
as
shaw
some
day
see
if
i
do
i
always
wanted
a
garden
like
grandmother
ware
with
a
and
a
beehive
in
it
just
for
the
artistic
effect
but
i
never
dreamed
of
making
a
fortune
out
of
it
and
i
intend
to
get
some
hives
as
soon
as
i
go
back
to
locust
said
lloyd
it
will
be
the
easiest
way
in
the
world
to
raise
money
for
ordah
of
hildegarde
that
the
name
of
the
club
i
belong
to
she
explained
to
phil
one
of
its
objects
is
to
raise
money
for
the
poah
girls
in
the
mountain
schools
we
get
so
tiahed
of
the
evahlasting
embroidery
and
fancy
work
and
as
ellestad
says
this
is
so
interesting
and
one
can
learn
so
much
from
the
bees
that
what
mary
was
telling
me
said
phil
gravely
but
i
must
confess
i
never
got
much
out
of
them
i
investigated
them
once
when
i
was
a
small
boy
stirred
up
the
hive
with
a
stick
and
by
the
time
i
was
rescued
i
was
pretty
well
puffed
up
not
with
a
sense
of
my
wisdom
however
they
stung
me
nearly
to
death
so
i
rather
shrunk
from
having
any
more
dealings
with
them
you
ca
deny
that
they
gave
you
a
good
lesson
in
minding
your
own
business
laughed
lloyd
well
i
do
care
to
have
so
many
teachers
after
me
all
teaching
me
the
same
thing
i
prefer
variety
in
my
instructors
they
do
all
teach
the
same
thing
cried
joyce
enthusiastically
i
had
no
idea
how
the
work
was
divided
up
until
i
began
to
study
them
people
have
watched
them
through
glass
hives
you
know
with
black
shutters
they
have
nurses
to
tend
the
nymphs
and
larvæ
and
ladies
of
honour
who
wait
on
the
queen
and
never
let
her
out
of
their
sight
and
is
it
odd
they
are
exactly
like
human
beings
in
one
thing
they
never
turn
their
back
on
the
queen
then
there
are
the
house
bees
who
both
air
and
heat
the
hives
by
fanning
their
wings
and
sometimes
they
help
to
evaporate
the
honey
in
the
same
way
when
there
is
more
water
in
the
flower
nectar
than
usual
there
are
architects
masons
waxworkers
and
sculptors
and
the
foragers
who
go
out
to
the
flowers
for
the
pollen
and
nectar
some
are
chemists
who
let
a
drop
of
formic
acid
fall
from
the
end
of
their
stings
to
preserve
the
honey
and
some
are
capsule
makers
who
seal
down
the
cells
when
the
honey
is
ripe
besides
all
these
are
the
sweepers
who
spend
their
time
sweeping
the
tiny
streets
and
the
bearers
who
remove
the
corpses
and
the
amazons
of
the
guard
who
watch
by
the
threshold
night
and
day
and
seem
to
require
some
kind
of
a
countersign
of
all
who
pass
just
like
real
soldiers
some
are
artists
too
as
far
as
knowing
colours
is
concerned
they
get
red
pollen
from
the
mignonette
and
yellow
pollen
from
the
lilies
and
they
never
mix
them
they
always
store
them
in
separate
cells
in
the
storerooms
whew
whistled
phil
beginning
to
fan
himself
with
his
hat
as
joyce
paused
anything
more
it
takes
a
girl
with
a
fad
to
deluge
a
fellow
with
facts
tell
him
about
the
drones
said
lloyd
meaningly
she
resented
being
laughed
at
do
like
the
school
of
the
bees
eithah
if
aristotle
and
cato
and
pliny
and
those
old
philosophahs
could
spend
time
studying
them
need
up
yoah
nose
at
them
lloyd
turned
away
indignantly
but
she
looked
so
pretty
with
her
eyes
flashing
and
the
colour
coming
up
in
her
cheeks
that
phil
was
tempted
to
keep
on
teasing
them
about
their
fad
as
he
called
it
his
antagonism
to
it
was
all
assumed
at
first
but
he
began
to
feel
a
real
resentment
as
the
days
wore
on
it
interfered
too
often
with
his
plans
several
times
he
had
walked
up
to
the
ranch
to
find
ellestad
there
ahead
of
him
with
a
new
book
on
bee
culture
or
an
interesting
account
of
some
new
experiment
or
some
ride
was
spoiled
because
when
he
called
the
girls
had
gone
to
shaw
ranch
to
spend
the
afternoon
joyce
and
lloyd
purposely
pointed
all
their
morals
and
illustrated
all
their
remarks
whenever
they
could
by
items
learned
at
the
school
of
the
bees
until
phil
groaned
aloud
whenever
the
little
were
mentioned
if
you
had
been
shapur
you
nevah
would
have
followed
that
bee
to
the
rose
garden
of
omah
would
you
asked
lloyd
one
day
when
they
had
been
discussing
the
legend
of
camelback
no
answered
phil
nothing
could
tempt
me
to
follow
one
of
those
irritating
little
creatures
not
even
to
reach
the
city
of
yoah
desiah
my
city
of
desire
would
have
been
right
in
that
oasis
probably
if
i
had
been
shapur
the
story
said
there
was
for
him
to
drink
and
the
fruit
of
the
he
had
everything
to
make
him
comfortable
so
what
was
the
use
of
going
around
with
an
ambition
like
a
burning
simoom
in
his
breast
i
do
believe
that
you
have
a
bit
of
ambition
said
lloyd
in
a
disapproving
tone
that
nettled
phil
have
you
i
ca
say
that
it
keeps
me
awake
of
nights
laughed
phil
and
i
ca
see
that
anybody
is
any
happier
or
more
comfortable
for
being
all
torn
up
over
some
impossible
thing
he
is
for
ever
reaching
after
and
never
can
get
hold
of
neahly
everybody
i
know
is
like
shapur
said
lloyd
musingly
joyce
is
wild
to
be
an
artist
and
betty
to
write
books
and
holland
to
go
into
the
navy
and
jack
to
be
at
the
head
of
the
mines
papa
has
promised
him
a
position
in
the
mine
office
as
soon
as
he
learns
spanish
and
he
is
pegging
away
at
it
every
spare
minute
he
says
jack
will
make
a
splendid
man
for
it
is
his
great
ambition
to
be
just
like
his
fathah
who
was
so
and
reliable
and
honahable
in
all
he
undahtook
that
he
had
the
respect
of
everybody
papa
says
jack
will
make
just
the
kind
of
man
that
is
needed
out
heah
to
build
up
this
new
country
and
he
expects
great
things
of
him
some
day
he
says
that
a
boy
who
is
so
faithful
in
small
things
is
bound
to
be
faithful
to
great
ones
of
public
trust
what
is
your
city
of
desire
asked
phil
who
did
not
relish
the
turn
the
conversation
had
taken
he
liked
jack
but
he
did
want
lloyd
to
sing
his
praises
so
enthusiastically
oh
i
only
a
girl
without
any
especial
talent
answered
lloyd
so
i
ca
expect
to
amount
to
as
much
as
joyce
and
betty
but
i
want
to
live
up
to
our
club
motto
and
to
leave
a
road
of
the
loving
heart
behind
me
in
everybody
memory
and
to
be
just
as
much
like
mothah
and
my
beautiful
grandmothah
amanthis
as
i
can
a
grandfathah
says
is
moah
needed
in
the
world
than
an
artist
or
an
authah
he
consoles
me
that
way
sometimes
when
i
feel
bad
because
i
ca
do
the
things
like
to
but
it
is
about
as
hard
to
live
up
to
his
ideal
of
a
as
to
reach
any
othah
city
of
desiah
he
expects
so
much
of
me
but
what
would
your
ambition
be
if
you
were
a
boy
asked
phil
lazily
leaning
back
in
the
hammock
to
watch
her
if
i
were
a
boy
she
repeated
a
light
leaped
up
into
her
face
and
unconsciously
her
head
took
its
high
princesslike
pose
if
i
were
a
boy
and
could
go
out
into
the
world
and
do
all
sawts
of
fine
things
i
would
be
content
to
sit
down
beside
the
well
and
the
want
something
to
do
that
was
hard
and
brave
and
that
would
try
my
mettle
i
want
to
fight
my
way
through
all
sawts
of
dangahs
and
difficulties
i
could
beah
to
be
nothing
but
a
drone
and
not
have
any
paht
in
the
world
and
look
here
said
phil
his
face
flushing
you
girls
are
associating
with
bees
entirely
too
much
you
learning
to
sting
chapter
xi
the
new
boarder
at
lee
ranch
mary
could
hardly
wait
to
tell
the
news
to
phil
and
lee
she
ran
nearly
all
the
way
from
the
wigwam
to
the
ranch
her
hat
in
her
hand
and
the
lid
of
her
flapping
long
before
she
came
within
calling
distance
she
saw
phil
mount
his
horse
out
by
the
pasture
bars
and
ride
slowly
along
the
driveway
which
led
past
the
tents
to
the
public
road
with
the
hope
of
intercepting
him
she
dashed
on
still
more
wildly
but
her
tripped
her
and
she
was
obliged
to
stop
to
tie
them
glancing
up
as
she
jerked
them
into
hard
knots
she
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
for
he
had
drawn
rein
to
speak
to
ellestad
and
the
new
boarder
who
were
sitting
in
the
sun
near
the
then
just
as
he
was
about
to
start
on
again
lee
came
singing
out
to
the
tents
with
an
armful
of
clean
towels
and
he
called
to
her
some
question
which
brought
her
laughing
to
join
the
group
thankful
for
these
two
delays
mary
went
dashing
on
toward
them
so
breathlessly
that
phil
gave
a
whistle
of
surprise
as
she
turned
in
at
the
ranch
what
the
matter
mary
he
called
indians
after
you
again
no
she
panted
throwing
herself
down
on
the
dry
bermuda
grass
and
wiping
her
flushed
face
on
her
sleeve
i
on
my
way
to
school
i
just
stopped
by
with
a
message
and
i
thought
you
like
to
hear
the
news
well
that
depends
began
phil
teasingly
we
hear
so
little
out
on
this
lonely
desert
that
our
systems
may
not
be
able
to
stand
the
shock
of
anything
exciting
if
it
good
news
maybe
we
can
bear
it
if
you
break
it
to
us
gently
if
it
bad
you
better
not
run
any
risks
ignorance
is
bliss
is
folly
to
be
wise
you
know
oh
come
now
tremont
that
too
bad
laughed
ellestad
head
her
off
that
way
when
she
in
such
a
hurry
to
tell
it
then
go
on
mary
said
phil
gravely
ellestad
curiosity
is
greater
than
his
caution
and
armond
has
been
in
the
desert
long
enough
to
be
affected
by
its
dearth
of
news
so
anything
sudden
hurt
him
go
on
mary
stole
a
glance
at
the
new
boarder
the
long
slender
fingers
smoothing
his
closely
clipped
pointed
beard
hid
the
that
lurked
around
his
mouth
he
was
leaning
back
in
his
apparently
so
little
interested
in
his
surroundings
that
mary
felt
that
his
presence
need
not
be
taken
into
account
any
more
than
the
well
she
said
as
if
announcing
something
of
national
importance
has
an
an
order
repeated
phil
what
under
the
canopy
is
that
is
it
catching
do
pay
any
attention
to
him
mary
ellestad
hastened
to
say
seeing
a
little
distressed
pucker
between
her
eyes
phil
is
a
trifle
slow
to
understand
but
he
wants
to
hear
just
as
much
as
we
do
well
it
an
order
to
paint
some
cards
explained
mary
speaking
very
slowly
and
distinctly
in
her
effort
to
make
the
matter
clear
to
him
you
know
the
links
back
in
plainsville
lee
you
heard
me
talk
about
grace
link
ever
so
many
times
her
cousin
cecelia
is
to
be
married
soon
and
her
bridesmaids
are
all
to
be
girls
that
she
studied
music
with
at
the
boston
conservatory
so
her
aunt
sue
that
link
is
going
to
give
her
a
bridal
musicale
it
to
be
the
finest
entertainment
that
ever
was
in
plainsville
and
they
want
joyce
to
decorate
the
souvenir
programmes
once
she
painted
some
place
cards
for
a
valentine
dinner
that
link
gave
she
did
that
for
nothing
but
link
has
sent
her
ten
dollars
in
advance
for
making
only
thirty
programmes
that
thirty
cents
apiece
they
to
have
cupids
and
garlands
of
roses
and
strings
of
hearts
on
no
two
alike
and
bars
of
music
from
the
and
bridal
chorus
joyce
is
the
happiest
thing
she
nearly
wild
over
it
she
so
pleased
she
going
to
buy
a
hive
of
bees
with
the
money
phil
groaned
but
mary
paid
no
attention
to
the
interruption
the
letter
and
the
package
of
blank
cards
for
the
programmes
came
this
morning
while
she
was
sweeping
and
she
just
left
the
dirt
and
the
broom
right
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
sat
down
on
the
and
began
sketching
little
designs
on
the
back
of
the
envelope
as
they
popped
into
her
head
lloyd
and
jack
and
mamma
are
going
to
do
all
the
cooking
and
housework
and
everything
so
joyce
can
spend
all
her
time
on
the
cards
they
want
them
right
away
is
that
splendid
exclaimed
phil
as
mary
stopped
out
of
breath
fortune
has
at
last
changed
in
your
favour
i
ride
straight
up
to
the
wigwam
to
congratulate
her
oh
i
almost
forgot
what
i
stopped
by
for
exclaimed
mary
lloyd
told
me
to
tell
you
that
you
need
come
to
take
her
riding
for
she
be
too
busy
helping
joyce
to
go
phil
scowled
the
turn
in
fortune
is
so
favourable
it
seems
well
if
i
not
wanted
at
the
wigwam
i
go
to
town
always
something
doing
in
phoenix
climb
up
behind
me
mary
and
give
you
a
lift
as
far
as
the
schoolhouse
as
they
galloped
gaily
down
the
road
lee
looked
after
them
with
a
troubled
expression
in
her
eyes
there
too
much
doing
in
phoenix
for
a
nice
boy
like
that
she
thought
i
wish
he
would
go
so
often
i
must
tell
him
the
experience
some
of
my
other
boys
have
had
when
they
went
in
with
idle
hands
and
full
purses
like
his
her
boarders
were
always
her
boys
to
lee
and
she
watched
over
them
with
motherly
interest
not
only
nursing
them
in
illness
and
cheering
them
in
homesickness
but
many
a
time
whispering
a
warning
against
the
temptations
which
beset
all
exiles
from
home
who
have
nothing
to
do
but
kill
time
now
with
the
hope
of
interesting
the
new
boarder
in
something
beside
himself
she
dropped
down
into
the
rustic
seat
near
him
hanging
the
towels
over
the
arm
of
it
while
she
talked
you
must
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
wares
armond
she
began
they
stayed
at
the
ranch
three
weeks
and
this
little
mary
and
her
brothers
kept
things
humming
the
whole
time
they
give
me
nervous
prostration
in
half
a
day
if
they
all
like
that
little
chatterbox
he
answered
listlessly
not
joyce
interrupted
ellestad
she
the
most
interesting
child
of
her
age
i
ever
knew
and
being
an
artist
yourself
you
could
fail
to
be
interested
in
her
unbounded
ambition
she
really
has
talent
i
think
for
a
girl
of
fifteen
her
clever
little
and
her
work
show
unusual
promise
then
i
sorry
for
her
said
armond
if
she
has
ambition
and
thinks
she
has
talent
life
will
be
twice
as
hard
for
her
always
a
struggle
always
an
unsatisfied
groping
after
something
she
can
never
reach
but
i
believe
that
she
will
reach
what
she
wants
some
day
was
the
reply
she
has
youth
and
health
and
unbounded
hope
the
other
day
i
quoted
an
old
norwegian
proverb
waits
not
long
who
waits
for
a
she
wrote
it
on
the
kitchen
door
saying
have
to
wait
till
i
can
earn
enough
money
to
buy
one
hive
of
bees
and
then
i
wait
for
that
hive
to
swarm
and
make
another
and
for
the
two
to
grow
into
a
hundred
and
that
into
two
hundred
maybe
before
i
have
enough
to
go
away
and
study
it
be
years
and
years
before
i
reach
the
mark
set
for
myself
but
when
i
really
an
artist
doing
the
things
dreamed
of
doing
that
will
be
a
feast
worth
any
amount
of
waiting
now
in
less
than
a
week
she
has
found
her
way
to
the
first
step
the
first
hive
of
bees
and
i
truly
glad
for
her
but
the
happier
such
beginnings
the
more
tragic
the
end
oftentimes
armond
answered
i
known
such
cases
scores
of
them
when
i
was
an
art
student
myself
in
paris
girls
and
young
fellows
who
thought
they
were
budding
geniuses
who
left
home
and
country
and
everything
else
for
art
sake
they
lived
in
garrets
and
slaved
and
struggled
and
starved
on
for
years
only
to
find
in
the
end
that
they
were
not
geniuses
only
to
face
failure
i
never
encourage
beginners
any
more
for
what
is
more
cruel
than
to
say
to
some
hungry
soul
on
wait
you
reach
the
feast
your
longing
shall
be
satisfied
when
you
know
full
well
that
in
only
one
case
in
ten
thousand
perhaps
can
there
be
a
feast
for
one
of
them
that
when
they
stretch
out
their
hands
for
bread
there
will
be
only
a
stone
but
you
reached
it
yourself
armond
you
know
you
did
answered
ellestad
who
had
known
the
new
boarder
well
in
his
younger
days
to
have
had
pictures
hung
in
the
salon
and
academy
to
be
recognized
as
a
success
in
both
hemispheres
is
that
enough
of
a
feast
to
satisfy
most
men
the
face
turned
to
him
in
reply
wore
the
look
of
one
who
has
fought
the
bitterest
of
fights
and
fallen
vanquished
no
to
have
a
sweet
snatched
away
just
as
it
is
placed
to
one
lips
is
worse
than
never
to
have
tasted
it
what
good
does
it
do
me
now
look
at
me
a
hopeless
invalid
doomed
to
a
year
or
two
of
unendurable
idleness
how
much
easier
it
would
be
for
me
now
to
fold
my
hands
and
wait
if
i
had
no
baffled
ambitions
to
torment
me
hourly
no
higher
desires
in
life
than
chris
there
he
pointed
to
the
swarthy
mexican
digging
a
ditch
across
the
alfalfa
pasture
no
he
repeated
i
never
encourage
any
one
now
to
start
on
such
an
unsatisfactory
quest
i
sorry
said
ellestad
when
i
heard
that
you
were
coming
i
hoped
that
you
would
take
an
interest
in
joyce
ware
you
could
be
the
greatest
inspiration
and
help
to
her
if
you
only
would
there
she
is
now
exclaimed
lee
who
sat
facing
the
road
it
does
me
good
to
see
any
one
swing
along
as
she
does
with
so
much
energy
and
purpose
in
every
movement
armond
turned
his
head
slightly
for
a
view
of
the
girlish
figure
moving
rapidly
toward
them
do
tell
her
that
i
am
an
artist
ellestad
he
said
hurriedly
as
she
drew
near
or
that
i
ever
lived
in
the
latin
quarter
or
or
anything
like
that
i
know
how
schoolgirls
gush
over
such
things
and
i
in
no
mood
for
callow
enthusiasms
joyce
errand
was
to
borrow
some
music
the
if
lee
had
them
from
lohengrin
and
tannhauser
she
remembered
seeing
several
old
on
the
organ
in
the
adobe
parlour
and
she
thought
maybe
the
selections
she
wanted
might
be
in
them
armond
sat
listening
to
the
conversation
with
as
little
interest
apparently
as
he
had
done
to
mary
after
acknowledging
his
introduction
to
joyce
by
a
grave
bow
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
seemed
to
withdraw
himself
from
notice
at
first
glance
joyce
had
been
a
trifle
embarrassed
by
the
presence
of
this
stranger
something
about
him
the
cut
of
the
short
pointed
beard
the
nervous
movement
of
his
long
sensitive
fingers
the
eyes
that
seemed
to
see
so
much
and
so
deeply
in
their
brief
glances
recalled
some
memory
vague
and
disturbing
she
tried
to
remember
where
it
was
she
had
seen
some
man
who
looked
like
this
one
is
it
very
necessary
that
you
should
have
the
asked
lee
coming
back
from
a
fruitless
search
in
the
parlour
a
few
bars
from
any
other
music
do
just
as
well
so
long
as
you
have
some
notes
i
should
think
any
other
march
would
carry
out
the
idea
just
as
well
no
said
joyce
all
the
guests
will
be
musicians
they
see
at
a
glance
if
it
was
appropriate
and
ordinary
music
would
not
mean
anything
in
such
a
place
i
know
where
you
can
get
what
you
want
said
lee
but
you
have
to
go
to
phoenix
for
it
i
have
a
friend
there
who
is
a
and
an
organist
i
give
you
a
note
to
her
if
you
care
enough
to
go
six
miles
oh
thank
you
lee
cried
joyce
i
be
glad
to
take
it
if
it
is
too
much
trouble
for
you
to
write
it
i
go
twenty
miles
rather
than
not
have
the
right
notes
on
the
programmes
armond
darted
a
quick
glance
at
her
through
eyelids
evidently
she
was
more
in
earnest
than
he
had
supposed
as
lee
went
to
the
house
to
write
the
note
ellestad
said
smilingly
mary
told
us
that
this
piece
of
good
fortune
will
bring
you
your
first
hive
of
bees
give
you
your
first
step
toward
the
city
of
your
desire
it
seems
appropriate
that
this
bridal
musicale
should
give
you
your
hives
did
you
ever
hear
that
the
bow
of
the
hindu
is
supposed
to
be
strung
with
wild
bees
no
she
answered
slowly
but
it
a
pretty
idea
is
it
then
her
face
lighted
up
so
brightly
that
armond
looked
at
her
with
awakening
interest
oh
i
so
glad
you
told
me
that
it
suggests
such
a
pretty
design
see
i
can
make
one
card
like
this
taking
a
pencil
from
her
hair
where
she
had
thrust
it
when
she
started
on
her
errand
and
catching
up
the
old
lee
had
brought
out
she
began
sketching
rapidly
on
a
i
have
a
little
cupid
in
this
corner
his
bow
strung
with
tiny
bees
shooting
across
this
staff
of
music
suspended
from
two
hearts
and
instead
of
notes
i
make
bees
flying
up
and
down
between
the
lines
wo
that
be
fine
armond
nodded
favourably
when
the
sketch
was
passed
to
him
very
good
he
said
looking
at
it
critically
slipping
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
he
held
it
an
instant
over
the
little
fat
cupid
as
if
to
make
some
correction
or
suggestion
but
apparently
changing
his
mind
he
passed
the
sketch
back
to
joyce
without
a
word
again
she
was
baffled
by
that
vague
the
gesture
with
which
he
had
taken
the
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
replaced
it
seemed
familiar
the
critical
turn
of
his
head
as
he
looked
at
the
sketch
was
certainly
like
some
one
she
knew
she
liked
him
in
spite
of
his
indifference
something
in
his
refined
melancholy
face
made
her
feel
sorry
for
him
sorrier
than
she
had
been
for
any
of
the
other
people
at
the
ranch
he
looked
white
and
ill
and
the
spells
of
coughing
that
seized
him
now
and
then
seemed
to
leave
him
exhausted
when
lee
came
out
with
the
note
joyce
rose
to
go
she
had
learned
in
the
short
conversation
with
ellestad
that
this
stranger
was
an
old
acquaintance
of
his
so
she
said
hospitably
we
are
your
nearest
neighbours
armond
i
know
from
experience
how
monotonous
the
desert
is
till
one
gets
used
to
it
whenever
you
feel
in
need
of
a
change
we
be
glad
to
see
you
at
the
wigwam
it
always
lively
there
now
he
thanked
her
gravely
and
ellestad
added
with
a
laugh
he
is
just
at
the
point
now
where
shapur
was
when
the
caravan
went
on
without
him
he
does
think
that
these
arid
sands
can
hold
anything
worth
while
oh
i
know
exclaimed
joyce
with
an
understanding
note
in
her
voice
it
dreadful
until
you
follow
the
bee
and
find
your
omar
you
must
tell
him
about
it
mr
ellestad
then
she
hurried
away
half
an
hour
later
she
galloped
by
on
the
pony
toward
phoenix
lloyd
was
riding
beside
her
as
they
passed
the
ranch
she
waved
a
greeting
with
the
note
which
lee
had
given
her
what
do
you
think
of
her
work
asked
ellestad
of
his
friend
one
could
judge
from
a
crude
outline
like
that
was
the
answer
she
so
young
that
it
is
bound
to
be
amateurish
still
she
certainly
shows
originality
and
she
has
a
capacity
for
hard
work
her
willingness
to
go
all
the
way
to
phoenix
for
a
few
bars
of
music
shows
that
she
has
the
right
stuff
in
her
but
i
would
encourage
her
if
i
were
in
your
place
when
ellestad
called
at
the
wigwam
that
afternoon
he
found
joyce
hard
at
work
a
row
of
finished
programmes
was
already
stretched
out
on
the
table
before
her
through
the
door
that
opened
into
the
kitchen
he
could
see
lloyd
at
the
her
face
was
flushed
and
there
was
an
anxious
little
frown
between
her
eyes
because
the
wrinkles
would
come
out
of
the
sheets
and
the
hot
irons
had
scorched
two
towels
in
succession
but
she
rubbed
away
with
dogged
persistence
determined
to
finish
all
that
was
left
in
the
basket
despite
pleading
that
she
should
stop
those
things
can
wait
till
the
last
of
the
week
just
as
well
as
not
she
insisted
but
lloyd
was
unyielding
no
suh
she
declared
i
nevah
had
a
chance
to
even
a
befoah
and
i
bound
i
do
it
now
i
begun
there
was
a
blister
on
one
pink
little
palm
and
a
long
red
burn
on
the
back
of
her
hand
but
she
kept
cheerfully
on
until
the
basket
was
empty
tell
me
about
armond
said
joyce
as
she
worked
he
reminds
me
of
some
one
i
seen
i
been
trying
all
afternoon
to
think
known
him
a
long
time
have
you
yes
i
met
him
abroad
when
he
was
a
mere
boy
answered
ellestad
wishing
that
he
had
not
been
asked
to
say
nothing
about
his
career
as
an
artist
the
tale
of
his
experiences
and
successes
would
have
been
of
absorbing
interest
to
joyce
armond
does
like
to
have
his
past
discussed
he
said
after
a
pause
he
made
a
brilliant
success
of
it
until
his
health
failed
several
years
ago
since
then
he
has
grown
so
morose
that
he
is
not
like
the
same
creature
he
has
lost
faith
in
everything
i
tell
him
that
if
he
would
rouse
himself
to
take
some
interest
in
people
and
things
about
him
if
he
even
read
and
get
his
mind
off
of
himself
then
he
quit
cursing
the
day
he
was
born
and
pick
up
a
little
appetite
then
he
would
live
longer
if
he
were
at
some
sanitarium
they
make
him
eat
but
here
he
wo
go
to
the
table
half
the
time
jo
fixes
up
all
sorts
of
tempting
extras
for
him
but
he
just
looks
at
them
and
shoves
them
aside
without
tasting
the
only
thing
i
have
heard
him
express
a
wish
for
since
he
has
been
at
the
ranch
is
quail
oh
we
going
to
have
some
for
supper
cried
joyce
jack
shot
seven
yesterday
he
gets
some
nearly
every
day
i
send
armond
one
if
you
think
he
like
it
that
is
if
they
turn
out
all
right
my
cooking
is
always
a
success
especially
when
my
mind
is
on
something
like
this
work
illustration
she
leaned
over
to
offer
him
the
little
basket
everybody
in
the
family
helped
to
get
supper
that
night
even
norman
so
that
joyce
might
work
on
undisturbed
till
the
last
moment
the
only
part
that
she
took
in
the
preparations
was
to
superintend
the
cooking
of
the
quail
and
to
call
out
directions
to
the
others
as
she
painted
garlands
of
roses
and
sprays
of
on
one
programme
after
another
spread
one
of
the
white
fringed
napkins
out
in
the
little
brown
covered
basket
mary
please
and
put
in
a
knife
and
fork
and
lloyd
i
wish
you
set
a
saucer
on
the
stove
hearth
where
it
get
almost
jack
if
you
have
the
pony
ready
at
the
door
i
fly
down
to
armond
with
a
quail
the
minute
they
are
done
so
that
he
get
it
piping
hot
no
i
take
it
myself
thank
you
you
boys
are
as
hungry
as
bears
and
i
painted
so
hard
all
afternoon
that
i
have
a
bit
of
appetite
i
feel
more
like
eating
if
i
have
the
ride
first
the
ranch
was
ringing
as
she
started
down
the
road
on
a
gallop
holding
the
basket
carefully
in
one
hand
and
guiding
the
pony
with
the
other
everybody
had
gone
in
to
the
but
armond
wrapped
in
a
and
overcoat
he
sat
just
outside
the
door
of
his
tent
his
hat
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
turning
from
the
driveway
she
rode
directly
across
the
lawn
toward
him
she
was
bareheaded
and
her
face
was
glowing
not
only
from
the
rapid
ride
but
the
kindly
impulse
that
prompted
her
coming
he
looked
up
in
astonishment
as
she
leaned
over
to
offer
him
the
little
basket
i
brought
you
a
quail
armond
she
said
breathlessly
you
must
eat
it
quick
while
it
blazing
hot
and
eat
it
every
bit
but
the
bones
for
it
was
cooked
on
purpose
for
you
it
do
you
good
without
an
instant
pause
she
started
off
again
but
he
called
her
wait
a
moment
child
i
have
thanked
you
ellestad
said
you
were
working
at
your
programmes
like
a
trojan
and
would
stop
long
enough
to
draw
a
full
breath
you
surely
have
finished
them
no
it
will
take
nearly
two
days
longer
she
said
gathering
up
the
reins
again
and
you
stopped
in
the
middle
of
it
to
do
this
for
me
he
exclaimed
i
certainly
appreciate
your
taking
so
much
time
and
trouble
for
me
an
entire
stranger
oh
no
you
not
a
stranger
she
protested
you
friend
then
may
i
ask
one
more
favour
at
your
hands
i
like
to
see
your
programmes
when
they
finished
before
you
send
them
away
there
is
so
little
to
interest
one
out
here
he
continued
apologetically
that
if
you
do
mind
humouring
an
invalid
whims
oh
i
be
glad
to
cried
joyce
flushing
i
bring
them
down
just
as
soon
as
they
done
that
is
she
added
with
a
mischievous
smile
dimpling
her
face
which
made
her
seem
even
younger
than
she
was
if
you
be
good
and
eat
every
bit
of
the
quail
i
promise
he
replied
an
answering
smile
lighting
his
face
for
an
instant
an
easy
promise
to
keep
he
thought
as
he
lifted
the
lid
and
took
out
the
hot
covered
dish
the
quail
on
the
delicately
browned
toast
was
the
most
tempting
thing
he
had
seen
in
weeks
what
a
kind
little
soul
she
is
he
said
to
himself
as
he
tasted
the
first
appetizing
morsel
fairly
brimming
over
with
consideration
for
other
people
as
ellestad
says
i
could
do
a
lot
for
her
if
it
seemed
the
right
thing
to
encourage
her
whether
it
was
the
quail
which
he
ate
slowly
enjoying
it
to
the
last
mouthful
or
whether
it
was
the
remembrance
of
a
pair
of
honest
friendly
eyes
beaming
down
on
him
with
neighbourly
and
sympathy
he
could
not
tell
but
as
he
went
into
his
tent
afterward
and
lighted
the
lamp
somehow
the
desert
seemed
a
little
less
lonely
the
outlook
a
trifle
less
hopeless
chapter
xii
phil
has
a
finger
in
the
pie
phil
went
up
to
the
wigwam
early
next
morning
breakfast
was
just
over
and
joyce
had
begun
painting
again
he
paused
an
instant
at
the
front
door
to
watch
her
brown
head
bending
over
the
table
and
the
quick
motion
of
her
deft
fingers
she
was
so
absorbed
in
her
task
that
she
did
not
look
up
so
after
a
moment
he
went
on
around
the
house
to
the
kitchen
ware
was
lifting
the
from
its
nail
to
its
place
on
the
table
and
lloyd
was
standing
beside
her
enveloped
in
a
huge
apron
holding
a
towel
in
her
hands
ready
to
help
norman
beside
a
chair
on
which
a
clean
napkin
had
been
spread
was
filling
the
jack
having
carried
water
to
the
tents
was
busy
chopping
wood
good
mawning
called
lloyd
waving
her
towel
as
phil
appeared
in
the
door
ware
turned
with
such
a
cordial
smile
of
welcome
that
he
took
it
as
an
invitation
to
come
in
and
hung
his
hat
on
the
post
of
a
chair
i
want
to
have
a
finger
in
this
pie
he
announced
i
was
told
to
stay
at
home
yesterday
but
i
do
intend
to
be
snubbed
wait
aunt
emily
that
kettle
is
too
heavy
for
you
he
had
called
her
aunt
emily
since
the
first
time
he
had
heard
lloyd
do
it
you
do
care
do
you
he
had
asked
it
makes
a
fellow
feel
so
forlorn
and
familyless
when
he
has
to
mister
and
madam
everybody
she
was
sewing
a
button
on
his
coat
for
him
at
the
time
he
asked
her
and
she
gave
such
a
pleased
assent
that
he
stooped
to
leave
a
light
kiss
on
the
smooth
forehead
where
gray
hair
was
beginning
to
mingle
with
the
brown
now
he
took
the
kettle
from
her
before
she
could
object
and
began
pouring
the
boiling
water
into
the
pan
let
me
do
this
he
insisted
i
have
had
a
hand
in
anything
of
the
sort
since
i
was
a
little
shaver
it
makes
me
think
of
a
time
when
the
servants
were
all
away
and
stuart
and
i
helped
aunt
patricia
she
paid
us
in
peppermint
sticks
and
cinnamon
drops
you
get
no
candy
here
she
answered
laughing
you
might
as
well
go
on
if
that
what
you
expect
but
there
was
no
resisting
the
coaxing
ways
of
this
big
handsome
boy
who
towered
above
her
and
who
took
possession
in
such
a
masterful
way
of
her
apron
and
his
coat
and
cuffs
were
off
the
next
instant
and
he
began
clattering
the
china
and
silverware
vigorously
through
the
hot
ware
taking
a
big
yellow
bowl
in
her
lap
sat
down
to
pick
over
some
dried
beans
and
to
enjoy
the
lively
conversation
which
kept
pace
with
the
rattle
of
the
dishes
it
was
interrupted
presently
by
a
complaint
from
lloyd
aunt
emily
he
does
wash
clean
he
left
egg
all
ovah
this
spoon
that
the
second
time
i
had
to
throw
it
back
into
the
watah
aunt
emily
it
is
so
mocked
phil
in
a
high
falsetto
voice
imitating
her
accent
it
bettah
than
she
could
do
huhself
she
no
great
shakes
of
a
housekeepah
i

retorted
lloyd
throwing
the
spoon
back
into
the
pan
with
a
splash
i
going
to
make
a
pie
foh
dinnah
and
you
get
any
then
probably
i
be
the
only
one
who
escapes
alive
to
tell
the
tale
aunt
emily
please
invite
me
to
dinner
he
begged
and
may
i
stay
out
here
and
watch
her
make
it
of
i
ca
help
it
if
she
chooses
to
ask
you
to
dinnah
said
lloyd
loftily
when
he
had
received
his
invitation
but
i
most
certainly
wo
have
you
standing
around
in
my
way
criticizing
me
when
i
begin
to
cook
you
can
fill
the
and
brush
up
the
crumbs
and
hang
these
towels
out
on
the
line
if
you
want
to
then
you
may
go
in
and
watch
joyce
paint
oh
thank
you
answered
phil
condescension
privileges
your
royal
highness
i
humbly
make
my
bow
he
bent
low
in
a
burlesque
obeisance
that
a
star
actor
might
have
envied
and
throwing
up
a
saucer
and
catching
it
deftly
began
to
sing
the
queen
of
hearts
she
made
some
tarts
upon
a
summer
day
but
none
could
look
that
selfish
cook
drove
every
one
away
it
was
all
the
most
idle
nonsense
and
yet
as
they
worked
together
in
a
playful
lloyd
liked
him
better
than
she
had
at
any
time
before
he
reminded
her
of
rob
moore
he
was
big
like
rob
tall
and
but
much
handsomer
rob
had
teased
her
since
babyhood
and
when
phil
began
his
banter
in
the
same
blunt
fashion
it
made
her
feel
as
if
she
had
known
him
always
and
yet
he
was
more
like
malcolm
than
rob
in
some
respects
she
thought
later
the
courteous
way
he
sprang
to
pick
up
her
handkerchief
the
quick
turn
he
gave
to
some
little
remark
which
made
it
a
graceful
compliment
his
gentlemanly
consideration
for
ware
all
that
was
like
malcolm
phil
would
not
be
driven
out
of
the
kitchen
until
he
had
exacted
a
promise
from
ware
that
he
might
come
the
next
day
and
make
the
dessert
for
the
morrow
dinner
vowing
that
if
it
were
not
heels
over
head
better
than
lloyd
he
would
treat
everybody
at
the
wigwam
and
on
the
ranch
to
a
picnic
at
prop
the
door
open
please
called
joyce
as
he
went
into
the
from
the
kitchen
i
need
some
of
that
heat
in
here
chilly
this
morning
when
one
sits
still
so
lloyd
moving
back
and
forth
at
her
could
see
their
heads
bending
over
the
table
and
hear
snatches
of
an
animated
discussion
about
a
design
he
proposed
for
her
to
put
on
one
of
the
programmes
put
a
line
from
me
thine
own
on
this
one
he
said
and
have
a
couple
of
perched
up
on
the
clef
cooing
at
each
other
and
make
little
hearts
for
the
notes
how
brilliant
cried
joyce
phil
you
a
genius
do
think
up
some
more
for
i
nearly
at
my
wits
end
trying
to
get
thirty
different
designs
do
make
them
all
so
fine
he
suggested
some
of
those
people
will
get
it
into
their
heads
that
matrimony
is
all
roses
he
lifted
his
voice
a
little
so
that
lloyd
could
not
fail
to
hear
she
was
standing
before
the
now
her
sleeves
tucked
up
and
a
look
of
intense
seriousness
on
her
face
as
she
sifted
flour
as
if
were
the
most
important
business
in
the
universe
make
the
queen
of
hearts
with
a
in
her
hand
and
a
scowl
on
her
face
as
she
will
look
after
the
ceremony
when
she
takes
it
into
her
head
to
make
some
tarts
put
a
bar
of
ye
disconsolate
with
a
row
of
tiny
pies
for
the
notes
and
the
old
king
doubled
up
at
the
end
of
it
with
the
knave
running
for
a
doctor
you
horrid
thing
called
lloyd
wrathfully
from
the
kitchen
you
have
a
bite
of
these
pies
now
nothing
personal
i
assure
you
called
phil
laughing
i
only
helping
the
artist
but
joyce
said
in
a
low
tone
it
a
little
personal
because
she
used
to
be
called
the
queen
of
hearts
so
much
did
you
ever
see
her
picture
taken
in
that
character
when
she
was
dressed
in
that
costume
for
a
valentine
party
it
was
years
ago
miss
marks
made
some
coloured
photographs
of
her
you
find
one
in
that
portfolio
somewhere
if
you
take
the
trouble
to
look
through
it
she
had
so
many
different
nicknames
continued
joyce
norman
was
hammering
on
something
in
the
kitchen
now
so
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
lower
her
voice
she
is
little
colonel
to
half
the
valley
and
i
suppose
always
will
be
to
her
grandfather
friends
then
when
she
started
to
school
about
the
time
that
picture
was
taken
she
was
such
a
popular
little
thing
that
one
of
her
teachers
began
calling
her
queen
of
hearts
both
boys
and
girls
used
to
fuss
for
the
right
to
stand
beside
her
in
recitations
and
march
next
her
at
calisthenics
and
she
was
sure
to
be
called
first
when
they
chose
sides
for
their
games
at
recess
then
after
she
was
in
that
play
with
her
dog
hero
that
mary
told
you
about
the
girls
at
began
calling
her
the
princess
winsome
and
then
just
princess
malcolm
mcintyre
who
took
the
part
of
the
knight
who
rescued
her
never
calls
her
anything
but
that
now
there
she
is
as
she
looked
in
the
play
when
she
sang
the
dove
song
joyce
pointed
with
her
to
another
photograph
in
the
pile
it
was
the
same
picture
that
mary
had
showed
him
the
beautiful
little
medallion
of
the
princess
winsome
holding
the
dove
to
her
breast
as
she
sang
flutter
and
fly
the
same
picture
which
had
swayed
on
the
pendulum
in
roney
lonely
cabin
repeating
with
every
tick
of
the
clock
for
love
will
find
a
way
phil
put
it
beside
the
other
photograph
and
studied
them
both
intently
as
joyce
went
on
then
the
other
day
when
her
father
was
here
i
noticed
that
he
had
a
new
name
for
her
he
called
her
that
several
times
and
when
he
went
away
he
said
it
in
a
tone
that
seemed
to
mean
so
much
my
little
phil
looked
from
the
pictures
on
the
table
to
the
original
standing
in
the
kitchen
wielding
a
under
ware
direction
the
morning
sun
streaming
through
the
window
was
making
a
halo
of
her
hair
somehow
he
found
this
last
view
the
most
pleasing
he
said
nothing
however
only
thrummed
idly
on
the
table
and
hummed
an
old
song
that
had
been
running
through
his
head
all
morning
what
that
you
humming
asked
joyce
when
she
had
worked
on
in
silence
several
minutes
phil
came
to
himself
with
a
start
i
sure
i
do
know
he
laughed
i
was
conscious
that
i
was
making
even
an
attempt
to
sing
it
went
this
way
said
joyce
whistling
the
refrain
softly
it
so
sweet
oh
that
said
phil
recognizing
the
air
that
a
song
that
old
english
nurse
used
to
sing
her
to
sleep
with
elsie
roams
by
lane
and
lea
her
heart
beats
low
and
sad
she
liked
it
because
it
had
her
name
in
it
and
i
liked
it
because
of
the
jingle
of
the
chorus
it
always
seemed
full
of
bells
to
me
he
hummed
it
lightly
lang
ling
she
seems
to
hear
her
ring
her
bonny
ring
it
must
have
been
these
bridal
musicale
programmes
that
brought
it
up
to
me
for
i
have
thought
of
it
in
years
and
that
suggests
something
to
me
answered
joyce
i
have
used
any
on
these
programmes
now
let
me
see
how
can
i
put
them
on
she
sat
studying
one
of
the
empty
cards
intently
here
this
way
cried
phil
i
ca
draw
it
as
it
ought
to
be
but
i
can
see
in
my
mind
eye
what
you
want
put
a
cupid
up
in
each
top
corner
with
a
bunch
of
five
narrow
ribbons
strung
across
from
one
to
the
other
in
narrow
wavy
lines
and
hang
the
little
bells
on
them
for
notes
then
the
ends
of
the
ribbons
can
trail
down
the
sides
of
the
programmes
sort
of
fluttery
and
graceful
pshaw
i
ca
make
it
look
like
anything
but
i
can
see
exactly
how
it
ought
to
look
he
scribbled
his
pencil
across
the
lines
he
had
attempted
to
draw
and
started
to
tear
the
paper
in
disgust
when
she
caught
it
from
him
i
know
just
what
you
mean
she
cried
and
phil
tremont
you
a
genius
this
will
be
the
best
design
in
the
whole
lot
she
was
outlining
it
quickly
as
she
spoke
you
ought
to
be
a
designer
make
your
fortune
at
it
for
originality
is
what
counts
why
do
you
study
it
i
did
have
it
in
mind
for
a
week
or
so
answered
phil
but
i
wanted
most
of
all
to
be
an
architect
or
something
of
the
sort
father
wanted
me
to
study
medicine
and
grandfather
thought
i
do
better
at
civil
engineering
but
i
could
settle
down
to
anything
i
suppose
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
i
was
thinking
too
much
about
the
good
times
i
was
having
and
did
want
to
buckle
down
to
anything
that
meant
hard
digging
so
last
year
father
said
i
was
getting
any
kind
of
discipline
and
that
i
had
to
go
to
a
military
school
for
it
that
there
i
would
at
least
learn
punctuality
and
order
and
that
military
training
would
fit
me
to
be
a
good
citizen
just
as
much
as
to
be
a
good
soldier
what
does
he
think
about
it
now
answered
joyce
i
beg
your
pardon
she
added
hastily
i
had
no
right
to
ask
such
a
personal
question
that
all
right
answered
phil
i
do
care
a
rap
if
you
do
talk
about
it
it
worried
me
a
good
deal
thinking
how
cut
up
the
old
pater
will
feel
when
he
finds
out
about
it
he
thought
he
left
me
in
such
good
hands
shut
up
where
i
could
get
out
into
any
trouble
and
i
hated
to
write
that
they
fired
me
almost
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
if
i
could
have
talked
to
him
and
explained
both
sides
of
it
how
unfair
the
major
was
and
all
that
and
how
we
were
just
out
for
a
lark
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
i
could
have
soon
convinced
him
that
i
meant
all
right
and
he
would
have
minded
so
much
but
i
never
was
any
good
at
so
i
kept
putting
it
off
the
first
two
weeks
i
was
here
i
wrote
last
week
but
it
takes
a
month
to
send
a
letter
and
get
an
answer
so
it
be
some
time
yet
before
i
hear
from
him
in
the
meantime
i
taking
life
easy
and
worrying
as
little
as
possible
joyce
made
no
reply
when
he
paused
only
bent
her
head
a
little
lower
over
her
work
but
phil
unusually
sensitive
to
mental
influences
felt
her
disapprobation
as
keenly
as
if
she
had
spoken
the
silence
began
to
grow
uncomfortable
and
finally
he
asked
lightly
toying
with
a
while
he
spoke
well
what
do
you
think
of
the
situation
do
you
want
to
know
honestly
asked
joyce
her
head
bending
still
lower
over
her
work
yes
honestly
her
face
grew
red
but
looking
up
her
clear
gray
eyes
met
his
unflinchingly
well
i
think
you
the
very
brightest
boy
that
i
ever
knew
anywhere
and
that
it
would
be
a
very
easy
thing
for
you
to
make
your
mark
in
the
world
in
any
way
you
pleased
if
you
would
only
make
up
your
mind
to
do
it
but
it
lazy
of
you
to
loaf
around
all
winter
doing
nothing
not
even
studying
by
yourself
and
it
selfish
to
disappoint
your
father
when
he
is
so
ambitious
for
you
and
it
yes
it
for
you
to
waste
opportunities
that
some
boys
would
almost
give
their
eyes
for
there
whew
whistled
phil
getting
up
to
pace
the
floor
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
that
the
worst
roast
i
got
well
you
asked
for
it
said
joyce
you
said
for
me
to
tell
you
honestly
what
i
thought
what
would
you
have
me
to
do
asked
phil
impatiently
anxious
to
justify
himself
a
fellow
with
any
spirit
could
get
down
and
beg
to
be
taken
back
to
school
when
he
knew
all
the
time
that
he
was
only
partly
in
the
wrong
and
that
it
was
unjust
and
arbitrary
of
the
officers
to
require
what
they
did
that
is
the
only
school
in
the
country
said
joyce
quietly
and
for
a
fellow
six
feet
tall
and
seventeen
years
old
a
regular
athlete
in
appearance
to
wait
for
somebody
to
lead
him
back
to
his
books
does
seem
a
little
ridiculous
does
it
confound
it
he
began
angrily
then
stopped
for
joyce
was
smiling
up
into
his
face
with
a
friendliness
he
could
not
resist
and
there
was
more
than
censure
in
her
eyes
there
was
sincere
admiration
for
the
handsome
boy
whom
she
found
so
entertaining
and
companionable
now
do
get
uppity
she
laughed
i
only
saying
to
you
what
elsie
would
say
if
she
were
here
phil
shrugged
his
shoulders
not
much
he
exclaimed
you
do
know
elsie
she
thinks
her
big
brother
is
perfection
she
has
always
stood
up
for
me
in
the
face
of
everything
daddy
never
failed
to
let
me
off
easy
when
she
patched
up
the
peace
between
us
would
rake
me
over
the
coals
the
way
you
do
joyce
liked
the
expression
that
crossed
his
face
as
he
spoke
of
elsie
and
the
gentler
tone
in
which
he
said
daddy
all
the
more
reason
then
she
answered
that
somebody
else
should
do
the
raking
i
hope
i
have
been
officious
it
only
what
i
would
say
to
jack
under
the
same
circumstances
i
so
used
to
preaching
to
the
boys
that
i
could
help
sailing
in
when
you
gave
me
leave
i
wo
do
it
any
more
though
see
here
is
the
design
you
suggested
finished
it
mollified
by
her
tone
and
her
evident
eagerness
to
leave
the
subject
he
dropped
into
the
chair
beside
her
again
and
sat
talking
until
lloyd
called
them
both
out
to
admire
her
pies
there
were
two
of
them
on
the
table
hot
from
the
oven
so
crisp
and
delicately
browned
that
lloyd
danced
around
them
clicking
a
couple
of
spoons
in
each
hand
like
castanets
and
calling
ware
to
witness
that
she
had
made
them
entirely
by
herself
do
they
look
delicious
she
cried
did
you
evah
see
moah
tempting
looking
pies
in
all
yoah
life
i
wish
grandfathah
could
have
a
slice
of
that
beautiful
custa
with
the
meringue
on
top
he
think
mom
beck
made
it
and
he
nevah
believe
unless
he
saw
it
with
his
own
eyes
that
i
could
make
such
darling
as
are
on
that
cherry
taht
i
wish
you
listen
cried
phil
do
you
know
that
proverb
about
letting
another
man
praise
thee
and
not
thine
own
mouth
i
not
praising
retorted
lloyd
i
just
praising
my
pies
and
if
they
good
and
i
know
they
good
why
should
i
say
so
they
the
first
i
evah
made
and
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
be
proud
of
their
turning
out
so
well
of
they
would
have
been
this
nice
if
aunt
emily
had
showed
me
what
to
do
let
sample
them
now
proposed
jack
who
had
been
called
in
from
the
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
pastry
lloyd
threw
herself
between
the
table
and
jack
with
a
little
scream
of
remonstrance
as
he
advanced
threateningly
with
a
knife
i
believe
lloyd
is
prouder
of
making
those
old
pies
than
she
was
of
shooting
the
duck
confess
now
are
you
he
insisted
yes
i
am
she
answered
emphatically
you
had
your
picture
taken
with
a
duck
suggested
phil
suppose
you
have
one
now
with
the
pies
to
add
to
your
collection
come
on
and
get
your
camera
and
i
take
a
companion
piece
to
the
we
call
this
the
of
tarts
stand
out
back
of
the
tent
and
hold
the
custard
pie
in
one
hand
and
the
cherry
tart
in
the
other
with
the
dimples
deepening
in
her
cheeks
as
the
whole
family
gathered
around
to
watch
the
performance
lloyd
took
her
position
with
the
white
tent
for
a
background
holding
her
hands
stiffly
out
in
front
of
her
she
stood
like
a
statue
while
jack
and
joyce
each
brought
out
a
pie
and
balanced
them
in
the
middle
of
her
little
pink
upturned
palms
i
want
to
take
two
shots
said
phil
waiting
for
them
to
step
out
of
range
there
are
several
blank
films
left
on
this
roll
now
he
ordered
when
the
shutter
clicked
after
the
first
exposure
hold
still
we
try
another
suppose
you
put
the
plates
up
on
the
tips
of
your
fingers
the
way
hotel
waiters
do
they
carry
things
that
way
with
such
an
easy
offhand
grace
i
always
admired
it
i
should
say
it
was
offhand
cried
jack
for
lloyd
obeying
orders
clutched
frantically
after
the
cherry
tart
with
a
shriek
of
dismay
it
had
refused
to
stay
poised
on
her
topside
down
of
she
wailed
as
the
broken
plate
fell
in
one
place
and
the
pastry
in
another
and
the
juice
is
running
all
ovah
me
and
the
darling
little
are
all
in
the
sand
phil
hastily
clicked
the
shutter
again
he
was
sure
that
the
second
snap
had
caught
the
tart
in
the
act
of
falling
and
with
the
third
film
he
wanted
to
preserve
the
expression
of
surprise
and
dismay
that
clouded
lloyd
face
it
was
one
of
the
most
ludicrous
expressions
he
had
ever
seen
pride
goeth
before
destruction
he
quoted
laughingly
i
wish
you
hush
up
with
yoah
old
proverbs
phil
tremont
cried
lloyd
and
it
all
yoah
fault
anyway
you
knew
i
spill
that
taht
if
i
held
it
that
way
and
i
just
believe
you
did
it
on
purpose
you
knew
when
you
first
saw
those
pies
it
would
be
useless
for
you
to
try
to
make
any
dessert
that
would
come
up
to
them
and
you
deliberately
planned
to
get
them
out
of
the
way
so
you
would
have
to
stand
the
test
you
were
afraid
you
have
to
give
the
picnic
you
promised
sputter
away
if
it
will
ease
your
mind
any
laughed
phil
it
was
worth
the
picnic
to
see
your
frantic
grab
after
that
tart
but
honestly
lloyd
he
said
growing
serious
as
he
saw
she
really
cared
i
as
sorry
as
i
can
be
that
it
happened
and
i
do
anything
you
say
to
make
atonement
i
withdraw
from
the
contest
award
you
the
laurels
and
give
the
picnic
anyhow
there
nothing
the
matter
with
the
custard
pie
piped
up
norman
you
can
see
where
joyce
fingers
jabbed
into
the
meringue
when
she
caught
it
from
lloyd
i
think
it
would
be
safer
to
eat
it
now
before
anything
else
happens
no
we
set
mamma
to
guard
it
till
the
rest
of
the
dinner
is
ready
said
joyce
leading
the
way
back
to
the
kitchen
if
everybody
will
fly
around
and
help
we
have
it
a
little
earlier
it
was
one
of
the
jolliest
meals
that
phil
had
had
in
the
wigwam
let
all
go
to
phoenix
this
afternoon
proposed
phil
when
they
had
gone
back
to
the
we
can
take
the
films
in
to
the
photographer
and
have
them
developed
joyce
you
may
ride
my
horse
and
i
get
one
from
mrs
lee
oh
thank
you
cried
joyce
looking
wistfully
through
the
window
the
outdoors
never
did
look
so
tempting
it
seems
to
me
and
those
programmes
are
getting
so
monotonous
i
can
hardly
make
myself
go
back
to
them
i
wish
i
could
go
but
i
ca
shirk
even
for
a
few
hours
or
they
might
miss
getting
there
in
time
could
anything
tempt
you
to
go
urged
phil
she
shook
her
head
resolutely
all
the
king
horses
and
all
the
king
men
could
draw
me
away
from
these
programmes
till
they
are
finished
no
wonder
she
preached
me
such
a
sermon
on
loafing
this
morning
thought
phil
as
he
rode
away
beside
jack
with
the
roll
of
films
in
his
pocket
anybody
with
that
much
energy
and
perseverance
does
need
to
go
to
the
school
of
the
bees
it
makes
her
all
the
harder
on
the
drones
and
i
know
that
what
she
thinks
i
am
chapter
xiii
a
change
of
fortune
it
was
nearly
two
next
day
when
the
thirtieth
programme
was
finished
and
placed
in
the
last
row
of
dainty
cards
laid
out
for
the
family
farewell
inspection
while
lloyd
cut
the
squares
of
which
were
to
lie
between
them
joyce
brought
the
box
in
which
they
were
to
be
packed
and
the
white
ribbons
to
tie
them
jack
having
saddled
washington
was
blacking
his
shoes
and
making
other
preparations
for
his
ride
to
town
a
special
trip
had
to
be
made
in
order
to
get
the
package
to
the
phoenix
in
time
they
might
wait
until
morning
i
suppose
said
joyce
as
she
began
placing
them
carefully
in
piles
of
ten
but
it
is
best
to
allow
all
the
time
possible
for
delays
then
the
programmes
have
to
be
written
on
them
after
they
get
to
plainsville
oh
i
link
will
like
them
i
do
see
how
she
can
help
it
exclaimed
lloyd
they
lovely
and
i
think
you
be
so
proud
of
them
you
would
know
what
to
do
i
am
pleased
with
them
admitted
joyce
stopping
to
take
one
last
peep
at
the
pretty
cupids
ringing
the
which
phil
had
suggested
it
was
the
best
design
in
the
lot
she
thought
oh
i
forgot
she
exclaimed
suddenly
looking
up
in
dismay
what
shall
i
do
i
promised
armond
that
i
let
him
see
these
cards
before
i
sent
them
away
you
wo
have
time
now
suggested
lloyd
i
suppose
jack
could
wait
a
few
minutes
but
i
thought
we
start
over
to
shaw
ranch
just
as
soon
as
the
cards
were
off
i
did
want
to
lose
a
minute
in
getting
my
hive
of
bees
after
i
earned
them
such
a
long
walk
over
there
and
back
that
i
do
feel
like
going
to
the
ranch
first
let
jack
stop
and
show
them
to
armond
suggested
her
mother
always
so
careful
that
he
can
be
trusted
to
tie
the
box
up
safely
afterward
oh
he
enough
answered
joyce
but
he
make
such
a
mess
of
it
tying
and
untying
the
white
ribbons
on
the
inside
of
the
package
he
ca
make
a
decent
bow
to
save
his
life
he
have
them
all
in
knots
and
strings
and
after
all
the
care
i
taken
i
want
link
to
find
them
just
as
they
leave
me
for
a
moment
joyce
stood
undecided
regretting
her
promise
to
armond
and
sorely
tempted
to
break
it
he
wo
really
care
she
thought
but
his
own
words
came
back
to
her
plaintively
there
is
so
little
to
interest
one
here
if
you
mind
humouring
an
invalid
whims
she
could
forget
the
hopeless
melancholy
of
his
face
and
what
ellestad
had
said
to
her
about
him
he
just
where
shapur
was
when
the
caravan
went
on
without
him
and
she
remembered
that
in
the
story
shapur
had
cursed
the
day
he
was
born
and
laid
his
head
in
the
dust
i
go
she
exclaimed
jack
can
follow
as
soon
as
he
is
ready
and
i
hand
the
package
to
him
as
he
passes
i
be
back
as
soon
as
i
can
lloyd
and
then
we
start
right
over
to
shaw
you
explain
to
jack
please
mamma
and
give
him
the
money
to
pay
the
postage
stopping
only
long
enough
to
write
the
address
on
the
wrapper
she
hurried
down
the
road
bareheaded
toward
the
ranch
lloyd
sat
down
on
the
front
to
wait
for
her
return
opening
a
book
in
which
she
had
become
interested
she
was
soon
so
deep
in
the
story
that
she
scarcely
noticed
when
jack
rode
away
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
glancing
up
for
just
an
instant
as
she
waved
her
hand
mechanically
in
answer
to
his
call
the
kitchen
clock
struck
two
then
three
with
the
last
stroke
came
a
vague
consciousness
that
it
was
growing
late
and
that
joyce
was
long
in
coming
but
the
absorbing
interest
of
the
story
made
her
immediately
forgetful
again
of
her
surroundings
it
was
nearly
four
when
ware
coming
out
beside
her
on
the
step
stood
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
to
peer
down
the
road
i
ca
imagine
what
keeps
joyce
so
long
she
said
anxiously
it
will
soon
be
too
late
for
you
to
go
to
the
shaws
but
even
as
she
spoke
joyce
came
in
sight
running
as
lloyd
had
never
seen
her
run
before
she
had
left
the
dusty
road
and
was
bobbing
along
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
where
the
hard
dry
sand
baked
into
a
crust
made
travelling
easier
oh
you
never
never
guess
what
kept
me
she
called
as
she
hurried
up
to
the
door
eager
and
breathless
seizing
her
mother
around
the
waist
she
gave
her
a
great
squeeze
oh
i
so
happy
so
happy
and
excited
that
i
do
know
whether
i
on
my
head
or
my
heels
i
feel
like
a
cyclone
caught
in
a
jubilee
or
a
jubilee
caught
in
a
cyclone
i
do
know
which
there
never
was
such
glorious
good
fortune
in
the
world
for
anybody
do
stop
yoah
prancing
and
dancing
and
tell
us
demanded
lloyd
or
we
think
that
you
lost
yoah
mind
joyce
sank
down
beside
her
on
the
her
face
was
shining
with
a
great
gladness
and
she
could
hardly
find
breath
to
begin
oh
there
are
words
good
enough
to
tell
it
in
she
gasped
armond
is
an
artist
mother
a
really
great
one
who
has
had
pictures
hung
in
the
salon
and
the
academy
ellestad
walked
part
of
the
way
home
with
me
and
told
me
about
him
he
studied
for
years
in
paris
and
lived
in
the
latin
quarter
and
had
a
studio
there
just
like
cousin
kate
friend
harvey
and
the
man
armond
looks
like
she
added
triumphantly
i
been
trying
to
think
ever
since
i
first
met
him
who
i
had
seen
before
with
a
short
vandyke
beard
like
his
and
long
fingers
that
seem
to
have
brains
of
their
own
and
that
what
makes
you
so
glad
laughed
lloyd
to
think
discovered
the
resemblance
do
get
to
the
point
i
wild
to
know
well
he
liked
my
work
thought
it
showed
originality
and
promise
and
if
mamma
is
willing
he
wants
to
give
me
lessons
think
of
that
lloyd
sherman
lessons
from
an
artist
a
really
great
artist
like
that
why
it
would
mean
more
for
me
than
years
of
class
instruction
in
the
art
league
or
anywhere
else
he
seemed
pleased
when
i
told
him
that
i
wanted
to
do
illustrating
because
he
said
that
that
was
something
practical
and
work
that
would
find
a
ready
market
he
told
me
so
many
interesting
things
about
famous
illustrators
that
he
has
known
that
i
have
come
away
all
on
fire
to
begin
my
fingers
fairly
tingle
oh
mamma
she
cried
two
great
happy
tears
welling
up
into
her
eyes
is
it
splendid
the
story
of
shapur
is
true
for
me
the
desert
holds
a
greater
opportunity
than
kings
houses
could
offer
but
the
price
my
dear
little
girl
and
that
the
best
of
it
interrupted
joyce
he
asked
to
be
allowed
to
do
it
for
nothing
time
hangs
so
heavily
on
his
hands
that
he
said
it
would
be
a
charity
to
give
him
something
to
do
and
ellestad
told
me
afterward
as
we
walked
home
that
i
ought
to
let
him
because
the
first
thing
that
he
has
taken
any
interest
in
for
months
that
with
something
to
occupy
his
mind
and
make
him
contented
he
would
get
better
much
faster
when
i
tried
to
thank
him
and
told
him
that
he
had
showed
me
a
better
way
to
the
city
of
my
desire
than
the
one
i
had
planned
for
myself
he
said
with
the
brightest
kind
of
a
smile
expect
to
get
far
more
out
of
this
arrangement
than
you
my
little
girl
are
the
alchemist
whose
courage
and
hope
shall
help
me
distil
some
drop
of
contentment
out
of
this
dreary
existence
he
is
going
to
drive
up
here
to
ask
you
about
it
and
to
see
the
work
i
have
already
done
i
glad
now
that
i
saved
all
those
charcoal
sketches
of
block
hands
and
ears
and
things
and
i
going
to
get
out
all
those
still
life
studies
i
did
with
miss
brown
and
pin
them
up
on
the
wall
so
he
know
just
how
far
i
gone
and
where
to
start
in
with
me
get
them
out
now
said
lloyd
you
never
did
show
them
to
me
there
was
some
very
creditable
work
hidden
away
in
the
old
portfolio
and
while
they
talked
and
looked
and
arranged
the
studies
on
the
wall
time
slipped
by
unnoticed
are
you
mighty
proud
aunt
emily
asked
lloyd
stepping
back
for
a
final
view
when
the
exhibit
was
duly
arranged
proud
and
glad
answered
ware
with
a
happy
light
in
her
eyes
it
was
always
my
dream
to
be
an
artist
myself
and
now
to
see
my
unfulfilled
ambitions
realized
in
joyce
more
than
compensates
for
all
my
disappointments
phil
coming
called
norman
from
the
yard
and
we
have
started
for
the
bees
exclaimed
joyce
it
so
late
we
have
to
put
it
off
until
but
all
plans
for
the
morrow
were
laid
aside
when
phil
told
his
errand
he
would
not
dismount
but
paused
just
a
moment
to
invite
them
to
the
promised
picnic
at
everybody
on
the
ranch
is
going
he
explained
even
jo
to
make
the
coffee
and
unpack
the
lunch
there
be
a
carriage
here
for
you
aunt
emily
at
three
and
you
must
let
mary
and
holland
stay
home
from
school
to
go
no
do
bother
to
take
any
picnic
baskets
he
interrupted
hastily
as
ware
started
to
say
something
about
lunch
this
is
my
affair
jo
is
equal
to
anything
even
cherry
tarts
and
custard
pies
and
i
must
make
the
atonement
i
promised
to
lloyd
for
spilling
hers
waiting
only
long
enough
to
hear
their
pleased
acceptance
he
dashed
off
down
the
road
again
ever
since
her
arrival
in
arizona
lloyd
had
wanted
to
see
the
famous
hole
in
the
rock
it
lay
several
miles
across
the
desert
in
a
great
red
butte
there
was
a
picture
of
it
in
the
ranch
parlour
and
nearly
every
tourist
who
passed
through
phoenix
made
a
pilgrimage
to
the
spot
and
took
snap
shots
of
this
curious
freak
of
nature
climbing
up
the
butte
toward
it
one
seemed
to
be
going
into
a
mighty
cave
but
when
he
had
passed
up
into
the
opening
and
down
over
a
ledge
of
rock
he
saw
that
the
cave
led
straight
through
the
butte
like
an
enormous
tunnel
and
at
the
farther
end
opened
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
giving
a
wide
outlook
over
the
surrounding
desert
it
was
a
favourite
spot
for
picnic
parties
but
of
all
ever
gathered
there
none
had
had
so
many
preparations
made
for
the
comfort
of
the
guests
phil
rode
over
several
times
once
to
be
sure
that
the
wood
he
had
ordered
for
the
had
been
delivered
and
again
to
take
a
load
of
canvas
chairs
rubber
blankets
rugs
and
cushions
so
that
even
the
invalids
on
the
ranch
could
enjoy
the
outing
it
was
the
first
of
march
where
the
irrigating
ditches
ran
almond
and
peach
orchards
were
pink
with
bloom
california
poppies
golden
as
the
sunshine
nodded
on
the
edges
of
the
waving
green
wheat
even
the
dry
hard
desert
was
sweet
in
its
miracle
of
blossoming
a
carpet
of
bloom
covered
it
stems
so
short
that
they
could
scarcely
raise
the
buds
they
bore
above
the
sand
bravely
pierced
the
crust
great
masses
of
yellow
and
blue
white
lavender
and
scarlet
transformed
the
bleak
solitary
places
for
a
little
while
into
a
glory
of
colour
and
perfume
an
odour
sweet
as
if
blown
across
acres
of
narcissus
made
ware
turn
her
head
with
a
little
cry
of
pleasure
as
they
drove
along
toward
the
butte
the
afternoon
of
the
picnic
it
the
desert
mistletoe
explained
phil
who
was
following
on
horseback
with
lloyd
and
joyce
the
surrey
which
jack
was
driving
it
is
in
blossom
now
hanging
in
bunches
from
all
those
high
bushes
over
yonder
lee
says
it
is
like
ours
the
berries
instead
of
being
little
white
wax
ones
like
pearls
shade
from
a
deep
red
to
the
palest
how
lovely
exclaimed
lloyd
i
hope
i
see
some
of
the
berries
befoah
i
go
home
oh
deah
the
days
are
slipping
by
so
fast
the
month
will
be
gone
befoah
i
know
it
phil
seeing
the
wistful
expression
in
the
eyes
raised
to
his
for
a
moment
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
her
let
walk
the
horses
then
he
said
laughingly
and
make
the
minutes
last
just
as
long
as
possible
we
have
to
fill
the
few
days
left
to
us
so
full
of
pleasant
things
that
you
never
forget
them
i
do
want
you
to
forget
this
day
anyhow
because
it
in
your
especial
honour
that
this
picnic
is
given
because
you
such
an
accomplished
queen
of
hearts
tahts
you
mean
she
answered
correcting
him
maybe
i
mean
both
he
replied
with
an
admiring
glance
that
sent
a
quick
blush
to
her
face
and
made
her
spur
her
pony
on
ahead
there
were
more
things
than
that
fragrant
breezy
ride
across
the
desert
to
make
her
remember
the
day
there
was
the
delicious
supper
that
jo
spread
out
under
the
sheltering
ledge
of
rock
at
the
entrance
to
the
great
hole
there
were
the
jokes
and
conundrums
that
passed
around
as
they
ate
the
witty
repartee
of
the
boy
from
belfast
that
kept
them
all
laughing
and
the
stories
gathered
like
the
guests
from
all
parts
of
the
world
this
is
the
first
picnic
i
have
been
to
since
the
one
at
the
old
mill
when
you
had
your
said
joyce
snuggling
up
beside
lloyd
against
a
pile
of
cushions
after
supper
as
the
blazing
dispelled
the
gathering
shadows
of
the
twilight
there
is
as
much
difference
between
the
two
picnics
as
there
is
between
a
cat
and
a
tigah
said
lloyd
tingling
with
the
horror
of
an
indian
story
that
the
cowboy
had
just
told
mine
was
so
tame
and
this
is
so
exciting
i
glad
that
i
did
live
out
west
in
the
times
they
are
telling
about
just
listen
phil
had
asked
for
an
indian
story
from
each
one
and
lee
had
begun
to
tell
her
experiences
during
her
first
years
on
the
ranch
no
actual
harm
had
come
to
her
but
several
terrible
frights
during
a
dreadful
apache
uprising
she
had
been
alone
on
the
ranch
with
only
george
who
was
a
baby
then
and
a
neighbour
daughter
for
company
they
had
seen
the
smoke
and
flames
shoot
up
from
a
distant
ranch
where
the
indians
fired
all
the
buildings
and
haystacks
and
they
had
waited
in
terror
through
the
long
hours
not
knowing
what
moment
an
arrow
might
come
hurtling
through
the
window
of
the
little
adobe
house
where
they
cowered
in
darkness
in
frightened
whispers
they
discussed
what
they
should
do
if
the
apaches
should
come
and
the
only
means
of
escape
left
to
them
was
to
take
the
baby
and
climb
down
the
jagged
rocks
that
lined
the
walls
of
the
well
the
water
was
about
shoulder
deep
even
that
was
a
dangerous
proceeding
for
there
was
the
fear
that
the
baby
might
cry
and
call
attention
to
their
or
that
some
thirsty
indian
coming
for
water
might
discover
them
lee
told
it
in
such
a
realistic
way
that
lloyd
almost
held
her
breath
feeling
in
part
the
same
fear
that
had
seized
the
helpless
women
as
they
waited
for
the
dreaded
and
watched
the
flames
of
their
neighbours
dwellings
she
shuddered
when
she
heard
of
the
scene
that
was
discovered
at
the
desolated
ranch
next
morning
an
entire
family
had
been
massacred
and
scalped
and
left
beside
the
charred
ruins
of
their
home
even
the
little
baby
had
not
escaped
as
the
twilight
deepened
the
stories
passing
around
the
seemed
to
grow
more
dreadful
mary
was
afraid
to
look
behind
her
and
presently
hiding
her
face
in
her
mother
lap
stuck
her
fingers
in
her
ears
it
was
a
relief
to
more
than
mary
when
jo
who
had
been
packing
the
dishes
back
into
the
baskets
behind
the
scenes
came
rushing
into
the
circle
around
the
fire
so
excited
that
in
his
wild
mixture
of
japanese
and
broken
english
he
could
hardly
make
himself
understood
he
was
holding
out
both
forefingers
from
each
of
which
trickled
a
little
stream
of
blood
each
bore
the
gash
of
a
which
had
slipped
through
his
fingers
in
his
careless
handling
of
it
as
he
kept
his
ears
strained
to
hear
the
indian
stories
illustration
he
was
holding
out
both
forefingers
he
laughed
and
jabbered
excitedly
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
face
finally
he
succeeded
in
making
lee
understand
that
the
cutting
of
both
forefingers
at
the
same
moment
was
the
sign
that
there
was
some
extraordinary
good
fortune
in
store
for
him
it
was
the
luckiest
thing
that
could
have
befallen
him
and
he
declared
that
he
must
go
at
once
to
the
chinese
lottery
in
phoenix
if
i
toucha
ticket
with
these
he
cried
holding
up
his
bleeding
fingers
i
geta
heap
much
money
fo
five
double
times
so
much
as
i
puta
in
i
be
back
fo
geta
breakfus
he
called
suddenly
darting
away
before
lee
could
protest
he
was
on
his
wheel
tearing
across
the
desert
trail
toward
phoenix
like
some
uncanny
wild
thing
of
the
night
the
superstitious
little
heathen
exclaimed
lee
if
he
should
win
i
may
never
lay
eyes
on
him
again
he
not
the
first
good
cook
that
i
lost
in
that
way
i
have
found
that
if
one
once
gets
the
gambling
fever
i
may
as
well
begin
to
look
immediately
for
a
new
one
chris
says
that
he
has
seen
men
lose
ten
thousand
dollars
at
a
time
broke
in
holland
his
eyes
big
with
interest
prospectors
used
to
come
in
from
the
mines
with
their
and
nuggets
and
they
spread
down
a
blanket
right
on
the
street
corner
and
play
sometimes
till
lose
everything
they
had
it
the
curse
of
the
west
sighed
lee
i
could
tell
some
pitiful
tales
of
the
young
men
and
boys
i
have
known
who
came
out
here
for
their
health
got
infatuated
with
the
different
games
of
chance
and
lost
everything
one
man
i
knew
was
such
a
nervous
wreck
from
the
shock
of
finding
himself
a
pauper
as
well
as
an
invalid
that
he
lost
his
mind
and
committed
suicide
another
had
to
be
taken
care
of
in
his
last
days
and
be
buried
by
a
charitable
society
and
another
had
to
write
to
his
sister
that
he
was
penniless
she
sewed
for
a
living
and
she
sewed
then
to
support
him
till
she
worked
herself
ill
and
died
before
he
did
he
spent
his
last
days
in
the
almshouse
we
should
have
showed
jo
alaka
eyes
and
told
him
the
indian
legend
said
ellestad
pointing
up
to
the
stars
do
you
see
those
two
bright
ones
just
over
camelback
mountain
look
up
in
a
straight
line
from
the
head
and
you
will
see
two
stars
unusually
brilliant
and
twinkling
those
are
the
eyes
of
the
god
alaka
he
lost
them
in
gambling
an
old
settler
told
me
the
story
he
got
it
from
an
indian
and
as
i
read
something
like
it
in
a
chicago
paper
this
winter
i
think
we
may
be
justified
in
believing
it
at
least
it
is
as
plausible
as
the
old
myths
the
ancients
told
of
the
stars
cassiopeia
chair
for
instance
and
leo
sickle
tell
it
begged
lloyd
i
rathah
heah
them
than
those
blood
and
thundah
apache
stories
i
not
be
able
to
close
my
eyes
every
voice
in
the
circle
joined
in
the
chorus
of
assents
that
went
up
except
phil
and
no
one
noticed
his
silence
but
lloyd
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
had
looked
uncomfortable
ever
since
lee
had
spoken
so
feelingly
of
the
curse
of
the
west
but
she
told
herself
that
it
must
be
just
her
imagination
that
it
was
the
flickering
shadows
of
the
that
gave
his
face
its
peculiar
expression
he
moved
back
into
the
darkness
against
the
rock
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
as
ellestad
began
the
story
once
there
was
a
young
god
named
alaka
sent
by
the
great
spirit
to
live
awhile
among
the
of
the
southwest
now
in
that
country
there
is
a
fever
that
lays
hold
of
the
children
of
the
sun
it
comes
you
know
not
how
and
you
can
not
stop
it
and
this
fever
that
runs
hot
in
the
veins
of
men
began
to
course
through
the
blood
of
alaka
a
fierce
fever
to
gamble
at
first
when
men
challenged
him
to
pit
his
skill
against
theirs
he
refused
knowing
that
the
great
spirit
had
forbidden
it
but
they
jeered
him
saying
ha
he
is
afraid
that
he
will
lose
this
can
be
no
god
or
he
would
not
fear
us
so
when
they
had
made
a
mock
of
him
until
he
could
no
longer
endure
it
he
cried
i
will
show
you
that
i
am
a
god
that
i
fear
nothing
forgetting
all
that
the
great
spirit
had
enjoined
upon
him
he
plunged
madly
into
the
game
now
the
most
precious
thing
known
to
that
people
is
the
turquoise
for
it
is
the
stone
that
stole
its
colour
from
the
sky
around
the
neck
of
the
young
god
hung
a
string
of
these
turquoises
and
one
by
one
he
lost
them
till
the
morning
found
him
with
only
an
empty
string
in
his
hand
still
the
fever
was
upon
him
and
he
could
not
assuage
it
so
he
put
up
his
shells
from
the
great
water
in
the
west
these
people
had
heard
of
a
great
water
many
days
journey
toward
the
setting
sun
but
to
the
dwellers
in
the
land
of
thirst
it
seemed
incredible
to
them
that
there
could
be
so
much
water
in
the
world
as
alaka
told
them
of
but
they
looked
upon
the
exquisite
colour
of
the
shells
he
brought
which
held
the
murmur
of
the
sea
in
their
hearts
and
counted
them
wonderful
treasures
and
they
gambled
all
day
with
alaka
to
gain
possession
of
them
still
the
fever
waxed
hotter
than
ever
within
him
and
when
he
had
lost
his
shells
he
put
up
his
measure
of
sacred
meal
when
he
lost
that
they
made
a
mock
of
him
again
saying
not
that
he
was
afraid
to
lose
but
that
he
had
no
skill
that
he
was
not
a
god
he
was
less
than
a
man
he
was
only
a
papoose
and
that
he
should
play
no
more
until
he
had
learned
wisdom
then
alaka
was
beside
himself
with
rage
will
show
you
he
cried
will
venture
such
mighty
stakes
that
i
must
win
he
plucked
out
his
right
eye
and
laid
it
where
the
turquoises
the
shells
and
the
sacred
meal
had
lain
but
the
eye
was
lost
also
and
after
that
the
left
eye
so
that
when
morning
dawned
he
staggered
into
the
sunrise
blind
and
ruined
then
he
called
upon
the
great
spirit
to
give
him
back
his
sight
but
the
great
spirit
was
angry
with
him
and
drove
him
away
into
the
land
of
shadows
and
he
caught
up
the
eyes
and
said
will
hang
them
up
among
the
stars
to
be
a
warning
for
ever
to
the
children
of
men
not
to
gamble
so
they
hang
there
to
this
day
and
the
wise
look
up
and
seeing
them
pray
to
the
great
spirit
to
keep
them
from
the
fever
but
the
unheeding
go
on
till
like
alaka
they
lose
their
all
and
are
lost
themselves
in
the
land
of
shadow
that
was
the
last
story
told
that
evening
around
the
the
moon
was
coming
up
and
phil
brought
out
ware
old
guitar
which
he
had
restrung
for
the
occasion
striking
a
few
rattling
chords
he
started
off
on
an
old
familiar
song
calling
on
all
the
company
to
join
his
voice
was
a
surprise
to
every
one
a
full
sweet
tenor
strong
and
clear
that
soared
out
above
all
the
others
except
lee
full
high
soprano
the
scotchman
rumbled
along
with
a
heavy
bass
one
by
one
the
others
caught
up
the
song
even
little
norman
joining
in
the
chorus
lloyd
was
the
only
one
who
sat
silent
sing
whispered
joyce
giving
her
a
commanding
nudge
lloyd
shook
her
head
it
so
heavenly
sweet
i
want
to
listen
she
replied
under
cover
of
the
song
the
music
and
the
mountains
and
the
moonlight
with
the
wide
white
desert
stretching
away
on
every
side
seemed
to
cast
some
sort
of
witchery
over
her
and
she
sat
with
hands
clasped
and
lips
parted
almost
afraid
to
breathe
for
fear
that
what
seemed
to
be
a
beautiful
dream
would
come
to
end
a
tremulous
little
sigh
escaped
her
when
it
did
come
to
an
end
time
to
strike
the
trail
again
called
lee
that
is
the
worst
of
these
outings
we
ca
stay
singing
on
the
mountains
we
have
to
get
down
to
earth
again
my
return
to
valley
life
will
take
me
into
the
deepest
depths
if
jo
does
come
back
in
the
morning
to
get
breakfast
oh
it
was
so
beautiful
sighed
lloyd
later
when
the
party
finally
started
homeward
across
the
desert
it
had
taken
some
time
to
collect
all
the
chairs
hampers
and
cushions
which
george
and
holland
took
home
in
the
ranch
wagon
the
moon
was
directly
overhead
lloyd
was
riding
beside
phil
a
little
in
advance
of
the
others
it
was
the
very
nicest
picnic
i
evah
went
to
phil
she
said
and
it
the
loveliest
memory
that
i
have
to
take
home
with
me
of
this
visit
to
arizona
i
glad
you
enjoyed
it
he
answered
taking
off
his
hat
and
riding
along
beside
her
bareheaded
in
the
moonlight
how
big
and
handsome
he
looked
she
thought
sitting
up
so
erect
in
his
saddle
with
his
eyes
smiling
down
into
hers
i
do
want
you
ever
to
forget
he
hesitated
an
instant
then
added
in
a
lower
tone
arizona
the
sweet
odours
of
the
night
came
blowing
up
from
every
direction
the
ethereal
fragrance
of
the
mistletoe
bloom
the
heavy
perfume
of
the
hanging
white
in
distant
orchards
behind
them
the
picnickers
began
to
sing
again
roll
along
silver
moon
guide
the
traveller
on
his
way
lloyd
looked
around
for
joyce
she
was
riding
far
in
the
rear
of
the
caravan
beside
the
carriage
where
lee
led
the
chorus
presently
the
old
tune
changed
and
some
one
started
the
bedouin
from
the
desert
i
come
to
thee
looking
down
at
her
again
with
smiling
eyes
phil
took
up
the
words
sending
them
rolling
out
on
the
night
in
a
voice
that
thrilled
her
with
its
sweetness
as
they
rode
on
side
by
side
across
moonlighted
desert
the
sun
grows
cold
and
the
stars
are
old
and
the
leaves
of
the
judgment
book
unfold
chapter
xiv
the
lost
turquoises
that
night
there
was
a
whispered
consultation
in
ware
tent
while
lloyd
was
undressing
in
the
other
one
sitting
on
the
edge
of
her
mother
bed
joyce
rapidly
outlined
a
plan
which
she
had
thought
of
on
her
way
home
you
see
i
have
done
anything
special
at
all
to
give
lloyd
a
good
time
she
began
this
picnic
was
phil
affair
when
i
was
at
her
there
was
something
new
on
the
programme
nearly
every
day
she
been
here
nearly
a
month
now
and
her
visit
will
soon
be
over
like
to
give
her
one
real
larky
day
before
she
goes
lee
said
that
i
could
have
bogus
and
as
it
is
saturday
the
children
will
be
at
home
to
help
you
so
i
thought
it
would
be
fun
for
jack
and
lloyd
and
me
to
ride
over
to
the
indian
school
it
so
interesting
and
it
does
cost
anything
to
get
in
then
we
could
go
on
to
the
ostrich
farm
just
outside
of
phoenix
lloyd
wants
to
get
some
kodak
pictures
of
the
ostriches
the
admission
fee
will
only
be
cents
for
the
three
of
us
i
can
pay
that
out
of
the
money
that
link
sent
and
get
a
nice
little
lunch
at
coffee
al
restaurant
and
still
have
enough
left
to
pay
for
my
hive
of
bees
we
can
spend
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
prowling
around
the
curio
shops
and
picture
stores
lloyd
wants
to
get
ever
so
many
things
to
take
home
bead
belts
and
moccasins
and
things
made
out
of
cactus
and
orangewood
i
have
said
anything
to
her
about
it
yet
but
phil
said
that
if
we
went
he
would
join
us
i
think
that
is
a
very
good
plan
said
ware
entering
into
whatever
joyce
proposed
with
hearty
interest
you
better
not
tell
her
or
you
lie
awake
talking
about
it
too
long
and
you
need
to
make
an
early
start
you
know
by
eight
next
morning
the
little
cavalcade
was
on
its
way
jack
and
lloyd
riding
on
ahead
and
phil
and
joyce
following
leisurely
the
road
they
took
led
through
irrigated
lands
and
green
fields
and
blooming
orchards
greeted
them
at
every
turn
instead
of
the
waste
stretches
of
desert
that
they
were
accustomed
to
seeing
i
wish
you
look
exclaimed
lloyd
drawing
rein
to
wait
for
joyce
and
phil
and
then
pointing
to
a
field
where
a
boy
was
ploughing
a
long
straight
furrow
that
an
ploughing
there
an
indian
in
a
cadet
unifawm
with
brass
buttons
on
it
does
it
seem
queah
jack
says
it
the
unifawm
of
the
school
and
that
they
have
to
weah
it
when
they
hiah
out
to
the
fahmahs
this
is
paht
of
their
education
i
like
them
best
in
tomahawks
and
blankets
it
seems
moah
natural
this
is
hiawatha
land
laughed
phil
nor
the
country
i
was
disappointed
too
to
find
them
so
tame
and
but
they
certainly
more
pleasant
as
neighbours
since
they
have
taken
to
civilization
you
remember
the
horrible
tales
we
heard
last
night
lloyd
had
expected
to
see
a
large
but
she
was
surprised
to
find
in
addition
so
many
other
buildings
dormitories
workshops
a
public
hall
and
the
fine
wide
streets
leading
around
the
central
square
gave
the
appearance
of
a
thrifty
little
village
they
lingered
long
in
the
kindergarten
where
the
little
papooses
were
so
interested
in
watching
them
that
they
almost
forgot
the
song
they
were
singing
about
baby
ball
so
soft
and
round
they
went
through
the
great
kitchens
where
indian
girls
were
learning
to
cook
and
the
tailoring
establishment
where
the
boys
were
turning
out
the
new
uniforms
down
in
one
of
the
parlours
a
little
girl
with
features
strikingly
like
those
of
sitting
bull
practised
the
exercises
at
the
piano
only
twice
did
they
see
anything
that
reminded
them
of
the
primitive
indians
in
one
of
the
workshops
a
swarthy
boy
sat
before
a
loom
such
as
the
old
squaws
used
to
have
weaving
patiently
a
navajo
blanket
and
in
one
of
the
buildings
where
dressmaking
was
taught
there
was
a
table
surrounded
by
busy
working
on
chains
and
belts
and
gaily
decorated
trinkets
that
made
lloyd
wish
for
a
bottomless
purse
they
were
all
so
tempting
so
much
time
was
occupied
in
watching
the
classes
in
and
in
listening
to
recitations
in
the
various
rooms
that
it
was
nearly
noon
when
they
reached
the
ostrich
farm
it
was
not
the
ranch
where
the
great
birds
were
hatched
and
raised
but
a
large
enclosure
near
the
line
where
they
were
brought
to
be
exhibited
to
the
tourists
so
after
watching
the
creatures
awhile
laughing
at
their
comical
expressions
as
they
tilted
mincingly
up
and
down
in
what
lloyd
called
the
perfection
of
and
taking
several
of
them
joyce
proposed
that
they
should
leave
their
horses
at
a
corral
farther
down
the
street
and
go
at
once
for
their
lunch
it
was
the
first
time
that
jack
had
been
inside
the
restaurant
and
he
was
glad
that
phil
who
often
lunched
there
was
with
them
to
take
the
lead
he
felt
very
young
and
inexperienced
in
the
ways
of
the
world
as
he
marched
in
behind
him
and
while
he
secretly
admired
the
lordly
air
with
which
phil
gave
his
orders
he
saw
that
the
girls
were
impressed
by
it
too
and
he
inwardly
resented
being
made
to
appear
such
an
insignificant
small
boy
by
contrast
he
had
supposed
that
they
would
sit
up
on
the
stools
at
the
which
one
could
see
from
the
street
that
is
where
he
in
his
ignorance
would
have
piloted
the
party
but
phil
passing
them
by
led
the
way
an
opened
out
from
the
upper
hall
but
ignoring
that
also
phil
kept
on
to
a
balcony
overlooking
the
street
where
there
were
several
small
tables
they
serve
out
here
in
hot
weather
he
said
and
it
warm
enough
i
sure
besides
we
be
all
by
ourselves
and
can
see
what
is
going
on
down
below
here
sambo
he
beckoned
to
a
coloured
waiter
passing
through
the
hall
and
soon
had
him
scurrying
around
in
haste
to
fill
their
orders
it
was
the
most
enjoyable
little
lunch
lloyd
could
remember
phil
who
somehow
naturally
assumed
the
part
of
host
had
never
been
so
entertaining
time
slipped
by
so
fast
while
they
laughed
and
talked
that
the
hour
was
finished
before
they
realized
that
it
had
fairly
begun
then
phil
putting
lloyd
camera
on
an
opposite
table
and
focussing
it
on
the
group
showed
the
waiter
how
to
snap
the
spring
and
hurried
back
to
his
chair
to
be
included
in
the
picture
which
they
all
wanted
as
a
souvenir
of
the
day
excursion
they
made
arrangements
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
after
that
jack
was
to
take
the
camera
to
a
photographer
and
leave
it
for
the
roll
of
films
to
be
developed
and
then
go
to
a
shoestore
and
the
grocery
phil
had
an
errand
to
attend
to
for
lee
and
a
few
purchases
to
make
lloyd
had
a
long
list
of
things
she
hoped
to
find
in
the
curio
building
they
agreed
to
meet
at
a
drug
store
on
that
street
which
had
a
corner
especially
furnished
for
the
comfort
of
its
patrons
besides
numerous
easy
chairs
and
tables
where
tired
customers
could
be
served
at
any
time
from
the
there
were
daily
papers
to
help
pass
the
time
of
waiting
and
a
desk
provided
with
free
stationery
it
was
just
four
when
joyce
and
lloyd
coming
back
to
the
drug
store
with
their
arms
full
of
packages
found
jack
already
there
waiting
for
them
he
was
weighing
himself
on
the
scales
near
the
door
i
been
knocking
around
here
for
the
last
he
said
go
out
and
look
for
phil
now
and
tell
him
you
are
ready
and
we
get
the
horses
and
bring
them
around
how
long
will
it
take
asked
joyce
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
probably
he
just
up
the
street
then
i
begin
a
lettah
to
mothah
said
lloyd
depositing
her
bundles
on
a
table
and
sitting
down
at
the
desk
joyce
picked
up
an
illustrated
paper
and
settled
herself
comfortably
in
a
the
big
clock
over
the
slowly
dropped
its
hands
down
the
dial
but
joyce
absorbed
in
her
reading
and
lloyd
in
her
writing
paid
no
attention
until
half
an
hour
had
gone
by
then
lloyd
folding
her
letter
and
slipping
it
into
an
envelope
looked
up
mercy
joyce
it
foah
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
mattah
before
joyce
could
answer
she
caught
sight
of
jack
through
the
big
hurrying
down
the
street
by
himself
he
was
red
in
the
face
from
his
rapid
walking
when
he
came
in
and
had
a
queer
expression
about
his
mouth
that
he
always
had
when
disgusted
or
out
of
patience
phil
busy
he
announced
he
wants
me
to
ask
you
if
you
mind
waiting
a
few
minutes
longer
he
would
ask
it
but
it
something
quite
important
we
ought
to
get
back
as
soon
as
we
can
said
joyce
for
i
been
away
all
day
and
there
the
ride
home
still
ahead
of
us
i
afraid
mamma
will
start
to
get
supper
herself
if
i
not
there
i
think
i
put
in
the
time
we
waiting
in
writing
to
the
walton
girls
said
lloyd
drawing
a
fresh
sheet
of
paper
toward
her
joyce
picked
up
her
story
again
and
jack
went
out
into
the
street
where
he
stood
tapping
one
heel
against
the
curbstone
and
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
then
he
walked
to
the
corner
and
back
and
peered
in
through
the
at
the
clock
over
the
when
he
had
repeated
the
performance
several
times
joyce
beckoned
for
him
to
come
in
it
after
five
she
said
it
must
be
very
important
business
that
keeps
him
so
long
it
is
answered
jack
i
go
back
once
more
and
if
i
ca
get
him
away
i
go
around
and
get
the
horses
and
we
just
ride
off
and
leave
him
ca
get
him
away
repeated
joyce
where
is
he
oh
just
up
the
street
a
little
way
said
jack
carelessly
pointing
over
his
shoulder
with
his
thumb
joyce
looked
at
him
steadily
an
instant
then
as
if
she
had
read
his
mind
said
with
startling
abruptness
jack
ware
you
might
as
well
tell
me
is
he
doing
what
ellestad
says
all
the
boys
out
here
do
sooner
or
later
getting
mixed
up
in
some
of
those
gambling
games
there
was
no
evading
joyce
when
she
spoke
in
that
tone
jack
had
learned
that
long
ago
but
with
a
glance
toward
lloyd
who
sat
with
her
back
toward
them
he
only
nodded
his
reply
startled
by
the
question
lloyd
turned
just
in
time
to
see
the
nod
i
did
intend
to
tell
on
him
blurted
jack
but
you
surprised
it
out
of
me
he
put
some
money
on
a
roulette
wheel
and
lost
all
the
first
part
of
the
afternoon
now
his
luck
has
begun
to
change
and
he
says
he
got
to
stick
by
it
till
he
makes
back
at
least
a
part
of
what
he
started
with
joyce
looked
up
at
the
clock
we
ought
to
be
going
she
said
drumming
nervously
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
with
her
fingers
then
she
hesitated
a
look
of
sisterly
concern
on
her
face
i
hate
though
to
go
off
and
leave
him
there
no
telling
when
he
come
home
if
he
feels
he
is
free
to
stay
as
long
as
he
pleases
goodness
jack
i
glad
it
is
you
i
be
having
a
fit
if
it
were
and
i
ca
help
thinking
how
poor
elsie
would
feel
if
she
knew
it
lloyd
what
do
you
think
we
ought
to
do
i
think
we
ought
to
go
straight
off
and
leave
him
she
answered
hotly
it
perfectly
horrid
of
him
to
so
fah
himself
as
a
gentleman
as
to
pay
no
attention
to
his
promises
he
made
a
positive
engagement
with
us
to
meet
us
heah
at
foah
and
now
it
aftah
five
i
nevah
had
a
boy
treat
me
that
way
befoah
and
i
must
say
i
have
much
use
for
one
that
will
act
so
presently
after
some
slight
discussion
the
girls
slowly
gathered
up
the
bundles
and
walked
up
the
street
to
the
corral
jack
hurried
on
ahead
so
that
by
the
time
they
reached
it
the
men
there
had
the
ponies
saddled
and
were
waiting
to
help
them
mount
and
tie
on
the
packages
by
the
many
leather
thongs
which
fringed
the
saddles
for
that
purpose
it
was
a
quiet
ride
homeward
a
cloud
seemed
to
have
settled
over
their
gay
spirits
nobody
laughed
nobody
spoke
much
the
story
of
alaka
was
still
fresh
in
each
mind
and
what
lee
had
said
about
the
curse
of
the
west
and
the
fate
of
the
men
she
had
known
who
had
become
possessed
by
the
same
fever
they
remembered
how
jo
had
come
in
at
daylight
and
sullen
after
his
night
losses
for
the
lucky
feeling
which
seized
him
at
the
sight
of
his
cut
fingers
had
been
a
mistaken
omen
of
success
all
that
he
had
saved
in
months
of
service
had
vanished
before
sunrise
in
the
same
way
that
alaka
turquoises
and
shells
and
eyes
had
gone
deeper
than
the
indignation
in
lloyd
heart
deeper
than
her
sense
of
wounded
pride
that
phil
should
have
been
so
indifferent
about
keeping
his
engagement
to
meet
them
was
a
sore
feeling
of
disappointment
in
him
he
had
seemed
so
strong
and
manly
that
she
had
thought
him
above
the
weakness
of
yielding
to
such
temptations
she
recalled
the
expression
of
his
face
the
night
before
when
he
drew
back
from
the
firelight
into
the
shadow
and
pulled
his
hat
over
his
eyes
as
ellestad
began
the
story
of
alaka
evidently
he
had
played
alaka
game
before
ah
that
night
before
how
the
whole
moonlighted
scene
rolled
back
over
her
memory
as
she
rode
along
now
slightly
in
advance
of
joyce
and
jack
phil
had
been
with
her
that
night
before
and
as
the
sweet
strains
of
the
bedouin
floated
out
on
the
stillness
of
the
desert
something
had
stirred
in
her
girlish
heart
as
she
looked
up
at
him
a
vague
wonder
if
it
were
possible
that
in
years
to
come
this
would
prove
to
be
the
one
the
stars
had
destined
for
her
and
as
if
in
answer
to
her
unspoken
wonder
his
voice
had
joined
in
higher
and
sweeter
than
all
the
others
as
he
smiled
down
into
her
eyes
but
now
there
was
a
little
twinge
of
pain
when
she
thought
that
he
was
a
prince
at
all
when
measured
by
the
of
old
hildgardmar
and
her
father
much
less
the
one
written
in
the
stars
for
her
he
was
strong
and
he
was
honourable
if
he
gambled
and
she
told
herself
that
she
was
glad
that
she
knew
it
and
now
that
she
had
found
out
how
much
she
had
been
mistaken
in
him
she
did
care
any
more
for
his
friendship
and
that
she
never
intended
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
him
a
dozen
times
on
the
way
home
joyce
said
to
herself
oh
what
if
it
had
been
jack
and
thinking
of
elsie
and
the
father
so
far
away
across
the
seas
she
wished
that
she
could
do
something
to
get
him
away
from
the
surroundings
that
were
sure
to
work
to
his
undoing
if
he
persisted
in
staying
there
supper
was
ready
when
they
reached
home
afterward
there
were
all
lloyd
purchases
to
be
unwrapped
and
admired
mary
had
hoped
for
a
as
it
was
saturday
and
they
had
not
had
one
during
visit
but
the
girls
were
too
tired
after
so
many
miles
in
the
saddle
and
by
nine
all
lights
were
out
and
a
deep
quiet
reigned
over
ware
wigwam
and
the
tents
the
moonlight
flooding
the
white
canvas
kept
lloyd
awake
for
awhile
as
she
lay
there
listening
to
the
distant
barking
of
coyotes
and
going
over
the
events
of
the
day
she
heard
the
approaching
sound
of
hoof
beats
some
lonely
horseman
was
coming
down
the
desert
road
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
to
listen
recognizing
the
sound
it
was
horse
clattering
over
the
little
bridge
but
it
paused
under
the
i
suppose
phil
has
come
up
to
apologize
she
said
to
herself
but
he
might
as
well
save
himself
the
trouble
no
explanation
could
evah
explain
away
the
fact
that
he
was
rude
to
us
and
that
he
i
could
forgive
the
first
but
i
nevah
can
forgive
being
so
disappointed
in
him
a
moment
later
seeing
no
light
and
evidently
concluding
that
his
visit
was
untimely
he
turned
and
rode
back
toward
the
ranch
lloyd
still
leaning
on
her
elbow
strained
her
ears
to
listen
till
the
last
footfall
died
away
in
the
distance
he
be
back
in
the
mawning
she
thought
as
she
laid
her
head
on
the
pillow
he
always
comes
sunday
mawnings
but
he
not
find
us
this
time
because
we
be
gone
befoah
he
gets
heah
joyce
had
arranged
to
keep
bogus
part
of
the
next
day
so
that
they
could
ride
into
phoenix
to
church
so
it
happened
that
when
phil
came
up
next
morning
it
was
to
find
nobody
but
mary
in
sight
ware
had
gone
to
the
seat
under
the
willows
to
read
to
norman
and
holland
the
beehive
had
been
brought
over
during
joyce
absence
the
day
before
and
placed
in
the
shade
of
the
bushy
where
the
hammock
swung
and
mary
was
swinging
in
the
hammock
now
with
a
book
in
her
lap
it
was
closed
over
one
finger
to
keep
the
place
for
she
was
listening
to
the
droning
of
the
bees
breathing
in
the
sweetness
that
floated
in
across
the
desert
from
its
acres
of
vivid
bloom
and
paying
more
attention
to
the
sunny
vibrant
world
about
her
than
to
the
hymn
she
was
learning
what
are
you
doing
mary
he
called
as
his
step
on
the
bridge
made
her
look
around
she
held
up
a
battered
old
volume
of
poems
and
moved
over
in
the
hammock
to
make
room
for
him
beside
her
i
learning
a
hymn
that
the
way
we
always
earned
our
missionary
money
back
in
kansas
i
going
to
sunday
school
with
hazel
and
george
this
afternoon
in
the
surrey
over
to
the
schoolhouse
her
uncle
has
one
there
i
did
have
any
pennies
to
take
so
mamma
said
i
could
begin
learning
hymns
again
as
i
used
to
do
back
home
as
usual
mary
rattled
on
scarcely
pausing
to
take
breath
or
give
her
listener
a
chance
to
make
reply
this
is
one
of
the
singing
hymns
the
kind
they
have
in
church
by
isaac
watts
i
like
it
because
it
about
bees
and
it
so
easy
to
say
how
doth
the
little
busy
bee
improve
each
shining
hour
and
gather
honey
all
the
day
from
every
opening
flower
joyce
picked
it
out
for
me
and
said
that
she
guessed
that
isaac
watts
must
have
gone
to
the
school
of
the
bees
himself
and
that
was
where
he
learned
that
finds
some
mischief
still
for
idle
hands
to
do
the
bees
hate
idle
hands
you
know
that
the
drones
and
although
they
are
patient
with
them
longer
than
you
suppose
they
be
it
always
ends
in
their
stinging
the
drones
to
death
and
lloyd
said
it
was
a
pity
that
some
other
people
she
knew
not
a
thousand
miles
away
could
go
to
school
to
the
bees
and
learn
that
about
satan
finding
mischief
for
idle
hands
to
do
and
joyce
said
yes
it
was
for
it
was
too
bad
for
such
a
fine
fellow
to
get
into
trouble
just
because
he
was
a
drone
and
had
no
ambition
to
make
anything
of
himself
and
i
asked
them
who
they
meant
but
they
just
laughed
at
each
other
and
would
tell
me
i
do
see
why
big
girls
always
want
to
be
so
mysterious
about
things
and
act
as
if
they
had
secrets
do
you
no
indeed
answered
phil
in
his
most
sympathetic
manner
he
stooped
and
picked
a
long
blade
of
grass
at
his
feet
and
joyce
said
that
if
alaka
had
gone
to
school
to
the
bees
he
would
have
lost
his
eyes
and
lloyd
said
that
if
somebody
kept
on
he
would
lose
at
least
his
turquoises
when
i
asked
her
what
she
meant
she
said
oh
she
was
just
thinking
of
what
ellestad
told
at
the
picnic
that
the
indians
thought
the
turquoises
were
their
most
precious
stones
because
they
stole
their
colour
from
the
sky
and
she
called
turquoise
the
friendship
stone
because
it
was
true
blue
phil
began
whistling
softly
as
he
pulled
the
blade
of
grass
back
and
forth
between
his
fingers
so
they
think
that
somebody
is
like
alaka
do
they
he
asked
presently
in
danger
of
losing
his
turquoises
his
friendship
stones
well
i
can
imagine
instances
when
that
would
be
as
bad
for
alaka
as
losing
his
eyes
phil
had
walked
up
to
the
wigwam
more
buoyantly
than
usual
that
morning
he
knew
that
he
owed
the
girls
an
apology
for
not
meeting
them
as
he
had
promised
and
he
was
prepared
to
make
it
so
penitently
and
gracefully
that
he
was
sure
that
they
would
accept
his
excuses
without
a
question
the
big
roll
of
bills
in
his
pocket
which
he
had
won
by
a
lucky
turn
of
the
wheel
did
not
lie
heavy
on
his
conscience
at
all
it
rather
added
to
his
buoyance
of
spirit
for
it
was
so
large
that
it
would
enable
him
to
do
several
things
he
had
long
wished
to
do
because
of
it
too
he
had
come
up
to
plan
another
picnic
this
time
an
excursion
to
paradise
valley
on
the
other
side
of
camelback
but
mary
report
of
the
conversation
which
had
puzzled
her
gave
him
an
uncomfortable
feeling
he
could
not
fail
to
understand
its
meaning
evidently
the
girls
knew
what
had
detained
him
in
town
and
were
displeased
with
him
oh
are
you
going
to
stay
for
dinner
asked
mary
as
he
slowly
rose
and
stretched
himself
it
sunday
you
know
and
we
always
expect
you
on
sunday
no
thank
you
he
answered
yawning
i
changed
my
programme
are
you
coming
back
this
afternoon
she
asked
anxiously
all
be
home
then
he
studied
the
distant
buttes
a
moment
before
he
answered
then
squared
back
his
shoulders
in
a
decided
way
settling
his
hat
firmly
on
his
head
no
he
answered
finally
i
promised
a
fellow
i
met
in
town
at
the
hotel
the
other
day
that
i
ride
over
and
see
him
soon
he
has
a
camp
over
on
the
other
side
of
with
an
old
duffer
out
here
for
rheumatism
i
took
a
fancy
to
the
fellow
the
minute
i
saw
him
and
it
turns
out
that
he

to

of
talking

taking

explain
his
actions

he
turned
away
with
a

morning
it
was
with
as
polite
a
lifting
of
his
hat
as
if
she
had
been
nineteen
instead
of
nine
she
watched
him

down

washington
had
not
lost
a

on
the
way
home
from
church
and
if
joyce
had
not
been
seized
with
a
violent
headache
that
sent
her
to
bed
with
a
bandage
over
her
eyes
the
day
would
have
ended
far
differently
for
lloyd
the
afternoon
went
by
quickly
for
lulled
by
the
drowsy
hum
of
the
bees
she
had
fallen
asleep
in
the
hammock
under
the
and
slept
a
long
time
then
supper
was
earlier
than
usual
as
jack
wanted
his
before
starting
to
the
ranch
chris
the
mexican
was
taking
a
holiday
and
had
offered
jack
a
quarter
to
do
the
milking
for
him
that
evening
holland
strolled
down
the
road
with
him
since
the
lost
horseshoe
prevented
him
taking
the
ride
he
had
expected
to
enjoy
scarcely
were
they
out
of
sight
when
an
old
buggy
rattled
up
from
the
other
direction
bringing
a
woman
and
her
two
little
girls
from
a
neighbouring
ranch
for
an
evening
visit
lloyd
who
was
on
her
way
to
the
tent
to
see
if
she
could
do
anything
for
joyce
comfort
heard
a
voice
which
she
recognized
as
shaw
as
the
woman
introduced
herself
to
ware
i
been
planning
to
get
over
here
ever
since
you
came
she
began
and
specially
since
i
got
acquainted
with
your
daughter
over
them
bees
but
like
there
nothing
in
life
on
but
work
so
this
evening
when
my
little
girls
begged
to
come
over
and
see
your
little
girl
says
i
to
myself
it
now
or
never
and
i
just
hitched
up
and
came
oh
deah
sighed
lloyd
i
do
want
to
spend
the
whole
evening
listening
to
that
tiahsome
woman
the
boys
are
gone
and
joyce
head
aches
too
bad
for
her
to
talk
i
do
know
what
to
do
she
stepped
softly
into
the
tent
insisting
on
rubbing
joyce
head
or
doing
something
to
make
her
more
comfortable
but
joyce
sent
her
away
saying
that
the
pain
was
growing
less
and
that
she
did
want
her
to
stay
shut
up
in
the
tent
that
smelled
so
strongly
of
the
camphor
she
had
spilled
lloyd
turned
away
and
wandered
down
to
the
pasture
bars
where
she
stood
looking
over
toward
the
west
the
sun
was
dropping
out
of
sight
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
come
to
the
wigwam
she
felt
lonesome
she
was
so
full
of
life
after
her
long
sleep
so
fresh
and
that
she
looked
around
her
restlessly
wishing
that
something
exciting
would
happen
she
was
in
the
mood
to
enjoy
an
adventure
of
some
kind
no
matter
what
while
she
stood
there
her
pony
who
had
often
been
coaxed
up
to
the
bars
for
sugar
now
came
up
through
curiosity
evidently
wondering
at
her
silence
come
on
old
boy
she
said
reaching
through
the
bars
to
grasp
the
rope
that
trailed
from
his
neck
you
settled
it
we
go
off
and
have
a
ride
togethah
with
some
difficulty
she
saddled
him
herself
and
then
because
she
did
not
want
to
disturb
joyce
by
going
back
to
the
tent
to
change
her
white
dress
for
her
divided
skirt
she
mounted
as
if
the
were
a
and
rode
slowly
out
of
the
yard
bareheaded
ware
fluttered
her
handkerchief
in
response
to
the
wave
of
hand
and
looked
after
her
as
she
took
the
road
to
the
ranch
going
to
see
lee
she
thought
and
then
turned
her
attention
to
her
talkative
visitor
it
was
merely
from
force
of
habit
that
lloyd
had
taken
the
ranch
road
she
was
in
sight
of
the
camp
before
she
became
aware
of
where
the
pony
was
carrying
her
then
she
turned
abruptly
hardly
knowing
why
she
did
so
phil
was
at
the
ranch
she
would
not
have
him
think
that
she
had
gone
down
with
the
hope
of
seeing
him
she
did
not
put
the
thought
into
words
but
that
is
what
influenced
her
to
turn
in
front
of
her
camelback
mountain
loomed
up
looking
larger
and
more
lifelike
than
usual
with
the
reflected
light
of
the
sunset
lying
rosy
red
on
its
summit
she
knew
that
there
is
something
extremely
deceptive
in
the
clear
arizona
atmosphere
and
had
been
told
that
the
distance
to
the
mountain
was
over
five
miles
but
it
was
hard
to
believe
it
looked
so
near
that
she
was
sure
that
she
could
reach
it
in
a
few
minutes
brisk
ride
that
she
could
easily
go
that
far
and
back
before
daylight
was
entirely
gone
an
old
game
that
she
had
played
at
the
cuckoos
nest
sent
a
verse
floating
idly
through
her
memory
how
many
miles
to
score
and
ten
can
i
get
there
by
candle
light
if
your
legs
are
long
and
light
there
and
back
again
out
the
witches
will
catch
you
with
somewhat
of
the
same
eerie
feeling
that
had
affected
her
when
she
joined
in
the
game
with
betty
and
the
little
appletons
she
turned
the
pony
into
the
narrow
trail
that
led
across
the
sand
in
and
out
among
the
later
those
same
gray
bushes
might
look
startlingly
like
witches
reaching
up
out
of
the
gloaming
it
a
good
thing
that
yoah
legs
long
and
light
she
said
to
the
pony
as
he
started
off
with
a
long
lope
and
it
a
good
thing
that
you
seem
as
much
at
home
heah
as
rabbit
was
in
the
when
fox
threw
him
in
for
stealing
his
buttah
i
glad
it
is
old
tar
baby
that
i
on
he
would
be
used
to
these
gophah
holes
and
would
stumble
into
the
first
one
we
came
to
oh
this
is
glorious
she
shook
back
her
hair
as
the
soft
breeze
blew
it
about
her
face
her
full
white
sleeves
fluttered
out
from
her
arms
again
she
had
that
delightful
sense
of
birdlike
motion
of
free
wild
swinging
through
space
on
and
on
they
went
never
noticing
how
far
they
had
travelled
or
how
dark
it
was
growing
till
suddenly
she
saw
that
she
was
not
on
any
trail
a
thick
growth
of
stubby
mesquit
bushes
made
almost
a
thicket
in
front
of
her
an
enormous
cactus
thirty
feet
high
stood
in
her
way
like
one
of
the
witches
from
its
thorny
trunk
stretched
two
great
arms
thrown
up
as
if
to
ward
off
her
coming
its
resemblance
to
a
human
figure
was
uncanny
and
she
stood
staring
at
it
with
a
fascinated
gaze
it
big
enough
to
be
the
of
the
camel
in
the
mountain
she
said
in
a
to
the
pony
then
looking
on
toward
the
mountain
she
realized
that
she
had
to
strain
her
eyes
to
see
it
through
the
rapidly
gathering
gloom
night
had
fallen
suddenly
and
the
mountain
seemed
farther
away
than
when
she
started
oh
it
will
be
black
night
befoah
we
get
home
she
thought
turning
in
nervous
haste
then
a
new
trouble
confronted
her
she
was
facing
a
dim
trackless
wilderness
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
get
home
she
had
kept
the
mountain
steadily
in
view
as
she
rode
toward
it
but
now
she
realized
that
it
was
so
large
that
she
could
easily
do
that
and
still
at
the
same
time
go
far
out
of
her
course
you
have
to
find
the
way
home
she
said
helplessly
to
the
pony
failing
to
remember
that
the
wigwam
pasture
had
been
his
home
for
only
a
few
weeks
and
that
left
to
himself
he
would
go
directly
to
his
native
ranch
illustration
clattering
down
the
road
as
fast
as
his
feet
could
carry
him
in
a
few
minutes
lloyd
found
herself
carried
along
a
narrow
road
not
more
than
a
wagon
track
while
she
knew
that
she
had
never
been
over
it
before
it
was
some
comfort
to
find
that
she
was
on
a
human
thoroughfare
and
not
lost
among
the
tracks
of
wandering
coyotes
and
the
pony
feeling
that
he
was
headed
toward
his
own
home
went
willingly
enough
and
lloyd
began
to
enjoy
her
adventure
how
exciting
it
will
sound
back
in
that
tame
little
valley
she
thought
lost
in
the
desert
i
give
the
girls
such
a
thrilling
description
of
it
that
they
feel
cold
chills
running
up
and
down
their
spines
it
a
wondah
that
the
cold
chills
do
run
up
and
down
me
but
i
not
one
bit
afraid
now
this
road
is
bound
to
lead
to
somebody
house
and
everybody
is
so
friendly
out
heah
in
the
west
that
whoevah
finds
me
will
take
me
home
the
pony
swung
along
a
few
rods
farther
then
startled
by
an
owl
rising
suddenly
out
of
the
wayside
bushes
with
a
heavy
flopping
of
wings
jumped
sideways
with
such
a
start
that
lloyd
was
almost
thrown
from
her
seat
it
was
an
insecure
one
at
best
and
she
was
about
to
throw
her
foot
over
into
the
other
stirrup
when
a
forward
plunge
sent
the
pony
into
a
gopher
hole
and
lloyd
over
his
head
when
she
picked
herself
up
from
the
road
and
looked
dizzily
around
she
gave
a
little
gasp
of
horror
the
pony
freed
of
his
burden
and
spurred
on
by
his
fright
was
clattering
down
the
road
as
fast
as
his
feet
could
carry
him
and
she
was
left
helpless
in
what
seemed
to
her
the
very
heart
of
the
great
desolate
desert
she
stood
motionless
till
the
last
faint
thud
of
the
pony
hoofs
died
away
down
the
road
then
she
looked
around
her
and
shivered
the
possibility
of
the
pony
not
going
straight
to
the
wigwam
had
not
yet
occurred
to
her
but
she
felt
that
under
any
circumstances
she
was
doomed
to
stay
in
the
desert
until
morning
they
would
be
badly
frightened
at
the
wigwam
and
would
rouse
the
ranch
to
send
out
a
but
they
might
as
well
look
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
as
to
make
an
attempt
to
find
her
in
the
darkness
she
did
not
know
where
she
was
herself
she
was
within
a
stone
throw
of
one
of
the
buttes
out
which
one
she
could
not
tell
she
stood
peering
around
her
through
the
twilight
with
eager
dilated
eyes
a
twig
crackled
near
her
trampled
underfoot
by
some
little
wild
creature
as
startled
as
she
the
desert
had
seemed
so
still
before
but
now
it
was
full
of
strange
whisperings
and
rustlings
remembering
what
jack
had
told
her
when
he
showed
her
the
nest
shared
by
snakes
and
owls
she
dared
not
sit
down
for
fear
some
snake
should
come
crawling
out
of
the
hole
from
which
the
owl
had
flown
she
felt
that
it
would
be
useless
to
walk
on
since
every
step
might
be
carrying
her
farther
away
from
the
wigwam
how
long
she
stood
there
in
the
road
she
could
not
tell
but
presently
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
growing
lighter
she
could
see
the
outlines
of
the
butte
more
distinctly
and
the
sky
behind
it
was
growing
gradually
luminous
then
she
remembered
that
the
moon
would
be
up
in
a
little
while
and
her
courage
came
back
as
she
stood
and
waited
when
its
round
familiar
face
came
peeping
up
over
the
horizon
she
felt
as
if
an
old
friend
were
smiling
at
her
i
neahly
as
glad
to
see
you
as
if
you
were
one
of
the
family
she
said
aloud
with
a
little
sob
in
her
throat
the
feeling
that
this
was
the
same
moon
that
had
looked
down
on
her
through
the
locusts
all
her
life
and
had
even
peeped
through
the
windows
and
seen
mom
beck
rocking
her
to
sleep
in
her
baby
days
gave
her
a
sense
of
companionship
that
was
wonderfully
comforting
it
was
tiresome
standing
in
the
road
and
as
she
dared
not
sit
down
and
risk
finding
snakes
she
decided
to
climb
up
the
side
of
the
butte
and
look
out
over
the
country
maybe
she
might
see
the
light
from
some
ranch
house
at
least
on
its
rocky
slope
she
would
be
freer
from
snakes
than
down
among
the
bushes
and
the
owls
nests
scrambling
over
a
ledge
of
rock
she
stumbled
upon
a
pile
of
tin
cans
and
broken
bottles
which
told
of
many
past
picnic
parties
near
that
spot
a
little
higher
up
she
clasped
her
hands
with
a
cry
of
pleased
recognition
she
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
great
hole
that
led
through
the
rock
only
two
nights
before
she
had
sat
on
that
very
boulder
and
speared
olives
out
of
a
bottle
with
a
there
were
their
own
sardine
cans
and
the
fragments
of
the
teacup
hazel
had
dropped
a
mound
of
ashes
and
some
charred
sticks
marked
the
spot
where
the
had
blazed
she
looked
around
wondering
if
by
some
happy
chance
jo
could
have
left
any
matches
a
brilliant
idea
had
come
to
her
of
lighting
a
bonfire
she
knew
that
it
could
be
seen
from
the
ranch
and
would
draw
attention
to
her
at
once
a
long
search
failed
to
show
any
stray
matches
and
she
wondered
if
she
could
find
flint
among
the
rocks
or
how
long
it
would
take
to
get
fire
by
rubbing
two
sticks
together
some
of
the
gruesome
tales
of
apache
warfare
that
had
been
told
around
the
fire
came
back
to
her
as
she
stood
looking
at
the
ashes
but
she
resolutely
turned
her
thoughts
away
from
them
to
the
indian
school
she
had
seen
the
day
before
it
was
wonderfully
comforting
to
think
of
that
little
indian
girl
at
the
piano
patiently
practising
her
exercises
and
of
the
indian
boy
in
the
uniform
ploughing
in
the
fields
it
made
them
seem
so
civilized
and
tame
the
time
of
tomahawks
and
tortures
was
long
past
she
assured
herself
and
there
was
not
nearly
so
much
to
fear
from
the
peaceful
pimas
and
maricopas
as
there
was
sometimes
from
the
negroes
at
home
so
quieting
herself
with
such
assurances
she
climbed
up
to
a
comfortable
seat
on
a
rock
where
she
could
lean
back
against
the
cavelike
wall
and
sat
looking
out
through
the
great
hole
as
the
moon
rose
higher
and
higher
in
the
heavens
half
an
hour
slipped
by
in
intense
silence
then
her
heart
gave
a
thump
of
terror
so
loud
that
she
heard
the
beating
distinctly
there
was
a
fierce
hot
roaring
in
her
ears
down
at
the
foot
of
the
butte
going
swiftly
along
with
moccasined
tread
was
a
stalwart
indian
not
one
of
the
peaceful
pimas
she
had
been
accustomed
to
seeing
but
a
apache
at
least
he
looked
like
the
pictures
she
had
seen
of
apaches
he
had
a
lariat
in
his
hand
and
he
stooped
several
times
to
examine
the
tracks
ahead
of
him
as
if
following
a
trail
instantly
there
flashed
into
lloyd
mind
what
lee
had
told
them
about
the
indians
allowing
their
ponies
to
run
loose
on
the
desert
sometimes
the
children
used
to
catch
them
and
keep
them
all
day
to
ride
but
woe
be
it
she
said
if
the
owner
tracked
his
pony
to
a
settler
house
before
it
was
turned
loose
he
always
took
his
revenge
lloyd
was
sure
that
this
was
what
the
indian
was
after
as
she
noticed
the
lariat
and
the
way
his
keen
eyes
followed
the
trail
she
almost
held
her
breath
as
she
waited
for
him
to
pass
on
but
he
did
not
pass
throwing
up
his
head
he
looked
all
around
and
then
leaving
the
trail
started
swiftly
up
the
butte
toward
her
almost
frozen
with
fear
lloyd
drew
back
into
the
shadow
and
rolling
over
the
ledge
drew
herself
into
as
small
a
space
as
possible
crouching
down
to
hide
her
white
dress
through
a
crevice
between
the
rocks
she
watched
his
approach
with
wide
terrified
gaze
sure
that
some
savage
instinct
like
a
bloodhound
sense
of
smell
had
warned
him
of
her
presence
for
an
instant
as
he
reached
the
remains
of
the
he
stood
motionless
looking
out
across
the
country
silhouetted
darkly
against
the
sky
like
the
head
on
the
leather
cushion
she
was
taking
home
to
her
grandfather
she
thought
or
rather
that
she
had
intended
to
take
maybe
she
would
never
live
to
see
her
home
again
she
crouched
still
closer
against
the
rock
rigid
tense
scarcely
breathing
with
a
grunt
the
indian
stooped
and
began
poking
around
among
the
scraps
left
by
the
picnickers
he
turned
the
blackened
brands
with
his
foot
then
moved
farther
along
attracted
by
the
gleam
of
a
bit
of
broken
bottle
evidently
the
coyotes
had
been
there
before
him
for
not
a
scrap
was
left
of
sandwiches
or
chicken
bones
but
like
the
coyotes
he
knew
from
past
experiences
that
it
was
profitable
to
prowl
where
picnics
were
almost
weekly
occurrences
the
gleam
of
something
steely
and
bright
caught
his
eye
lloyd
saw
the
object
flash
in
the
moonlight
as
he
picked
it
up
it
was
the
jo
had
dropped
in
his
excitement
when
he
found
the
lucky
cuts
on
his
forefingers
with
another
grunt
he
turned
it
this
way
and
that
examined
the
handle
and
tried
the
edge
and
then
looked
stealthily
around
lloyd
closed
her
eyes
lest
the
very
intensity
of
their
gaze
should
draw
him
to
her
she
knew
that
another
step
or
two
would
bring
him
to
higher
ground
where
he
could
look
over
the
ledge
and
see
her
how
she
ever
lived
through
the
moments
that
followed
she
never
knew
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
heart
had
stopped
beating
and
she
was
growing
clammy
and
faint
it
could
not
have
been
more
than
a
few
minutes
but
it
seemed
hours
to
her
when
the
suspense
growing
unbearable
she
opened
her
eyes
and
peered
fearfully
through
the
crack
again
he
had
disappeared
trembling
so
that
she
could
scarcely
stand
she
ventured
little
by
little
to
raise
herself
until
she
could
look
over
the
rock
then
she
saw
him
moving
leisurely
down
the
path
at
the
foot
of
the
butte
in
a
moment
more
he
had
reached
the
road
and
striding
along
he
grew
smaller
and
smaller
to
her
sight
till
he
disappeared
among
the
dark
patches
of
lloyd
sank
limply
down
among
the
rocks
again
so
exhausted
by
the
nervous
strain
that
the
tears
began
to
come
the
night
was
passing
like
a
hideous
dream
half
an
hour
went
by
she
could
hear
the
distant
barking
of
coyotes
and
a
nervous
dread
took
possession
of
her
a
fear
that
their
long
gaunt
forms
might
come
sneaking
up
the
path
after
awhile
in
search
of
other
picnic
leavings
she
eyed
the
swaying
shadows
apprehensively
presently
as
she
sat
and
watched
tense
and
alert
she
saw
some
one
coming
along
the
wagon
track
far
below
he
was
on
horseback
and
riding
slowly
as
if
enjoying
the
calm
beauty
of
the
night
she
could
hear
him
whistling
as
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
butte
the
whistling
changed
to
singing
the
full
strong
voice
that
rang
out
on
the
deathlike
stillness
was
wonderfully
rich
and
sweet
from
the
desert
i
come
to
thee
it
was
the
bedouin
song
lloyd
listened
wonderingly
her
lips
was
this
part
of
the
dream
she
asked
herself
part
of
the
strange
unreal
night
that
was
certainly
phil
voice
and
yet
it
was
past
belief
that
he
should
be
riding
by
this
place
at
such
an
hour
of
the
night
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
voice
nor
the
song
that
had
been
haunting
her
memory
for
the
last
two
days
till
the
sun
grows
cold
and
the
stars
are
old
lloyd
hesitated
no
longer
scrambling
up
from
the
rocks
she
went
running
down
the
steep
path
calling
at
the
top
of
her
voice
phil
oh
phil
wait
it
was
phil
turn
to
think
he
was
dreaming
flying
down
the
path
with
her
white
dress
fluttering
behind
her
in
the
moonlight
and
her
long
fair
hair
streaming
loosely
over
her
shoulder
lloyd
looked
more
wraithlike
than
human
and
to
be
confronted
by
such
a
figure
in
the
heart
of
a
lonely
desert
was
such
a
surprise
that
phil
could
scarcely
believe
that
he
saw
aright
a
moment
more
and
with
both
her
cold
trembling
little
hands
in
his
big
warm
ones
lloyd
was
sobbing
out
the
story
of
her
fright
the
reaction
was
so
great
when
she
found
herself
in
his
protecting
presence
that
she
could
not
keep
back
the
tears
he
swung
her
up
into
his
saddle
in
the
same
brotherly
way
he
had
lifted
mary
into
the
cart
the
day
he
found
her
running
home
from
school
and
proceeded
to
comfort
her
in
the
same
joking
fashion
this
is
the
second
time
that
i
have
been
called
on
to
play
the
bold
rescuer
act
i
begin
to
think
soon
that
my
mission
in
life
is
to
snatch
fair
maidens
from
the
bloody
scalpers
of
the
plains
then
more
gently
as
he
saw
how
hard
it
was
for
her
to
control
herself
he
spoke
as
he
often
spoke
to
mary
there
never
mind
lloyd
do
cry
it
all
right
little
girl
soon
be
home
it
only
a
few
miles
from
here
it
is
as
late
as
you
think
only
eight
slipping
his
watch
back
into
his
pocket
he
began
to
explain
how
he
happened
to
be
passing
he
had
stayed
to
supper
at
the
camp
where
he
had
gone
to
call
on
his
new
acquaintance
and
had
purposely
waited
for
the
moon
to
come
up
before
starting
home
he
had
put
the
rein
into
her
hands
at
first
but
now
taking
it
himself
he
walked
along
beside
her
leading
the
horse
slowly
homeward
with
the
greatest
tact
feeling
that
lloyd
would
gain
her
sooner
if
he
did
not
talk
to
her
he
began
to
sing
again
half
to
himself
as
if
unmindful
of
her
presence
and
of
the
little
dabs
she
was
making
at
her
eyes
with
a
wet
handkerchief
maid
elsie
roams
by
lane
and
lea
it
was
the
song
that
his
old
english
nurse
had
sung
kling
lang
ling
she
hears
her
bonny
ring
when
he
had
sung
it
through
lloyd
handkerchief
was
no
longer
making
hasty
passes
at
her
eyes
i
wonder
what
my
little
sister
elsie
is
doing
he
said
that
song
always
makes
me
think
of
her
tell
me
about
her
said
lloyd
who
wanted
a
little
more
time
to
regain
her
composure
he
understood
why
she
asked
and
began
to
talk
simply
to
divert
her
mind
from
her
recent
fright
but
presently
her
eager
questions
showed
that
she
was
interested
and
he
talked
on
feeling
that
it
was
good
to
have
such
an
appreciative
listener
he
began
to
enjoy
the
reminiscences
himself
and
as
he
talked
the
old
days
seemed
to
draw
very
near
till
they
gave
him
a
homesick
feeling
for
the
old
place
that
would
never
welcome
him
again
it
had
gone
to
strangers
he
told
her
and
aunt
patricia
was
dead
poor
old
aunt
patricia
he
added
after
laughing
over
one
of
the
pranks
they
had
played
on
her
she
never
did
understand
boys
we
tried
her
patience
terribly
she
did
the
best
she
could
for
us
but
often
thought
how
different
it
would
have
been
if
my
mother
had
lived
i
had
a
letter
from
daddy
in
answer
to
the
one
i
wrote
about
leaving
school
it
broke
me
all
up
made
me
think
of
the
time
when
i
was
a
little
fellow
and
he
rocked
me
to
sleep
one
night
when
i
had
been
naughty
and
explained
why
i
ought
to
be
a
good
boy
it
almost
made
me
wish
i
could
be
a
little
kid
again
and
curl
up
in
his
arms
and
tell
him
i
was
sorry
and
would
turn
over
a
new
leaf
lloyd
liked
the
affectionate
almost
wistful
way
in
which
he
spoke
of
his
father
as
daddy
whatever
indignation
she
had
felt
toward
him
was
wiped
away
by
those
confidences
and
when
he
apologized
presently
in
his
most
winning
way
for
not
keeping
his
engagement
and
told
her
frankly
what
had
prevented
she
liked
him
better
than
she
had
done
before
she
wondered
how
it
could
be
so
but
she
felt
now
that
she
knew
him
as
well
as
malcolm
or
rob
and
that
their
friendship
was
not
the
growth
of
a
few
weeks
but
that
it
reached
back
to
the
very
beginning
of
things
you
ca
imagine
what
a
fascination
there
is
in
seeing
that
roulette
wheel
whirl
around
he
said
but
i
done
with
that
now
letter
settled
the
question
and
even
if
that
had
come
i
would
have
stopped
i
do
want
to
lose
my
precious
turquoises
my
friendship
stones
he
added
meaningly
i
know
how
you
and
joyce
feel
about
it
look
at
old
alaka
eyes
twinkling
up
there
over
camelback
they
seem
to
know
that
i
have
heeded
their
warning
presently
as
they
went
along
he
glanced
up
at
her
with
a
smile
do
you
know
he
said
you
look
just
as
you
did
the
first
time
i
saw
you
as
you
rode
up
to
the
gate
at
locust
all
in
white
and
on
a
black
horse
maybe
having
your
hair
hanging
loose
as
you
did
then
makes
me
think
so
i
never
imagined
then
that
i
ever
see
you
again
much
less
find
you
away
out
here
on
the
desert
it
is
queah
answered
lloyd
i
thought
i
must
be
dreaming
when
i
heard
you
sing
the
desert
i
come
to
thee
and
i
certainly
thought
i
was
dreaming
answered
phil
when
in
answer
to
my
call
you
appeared
all
in
white
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
for
an
instant
i
was
startled
then
i
thanked
my
lucky
stars
that
led
me
your
way
he
began
again
humming
the
bedouin
song
lloyd
looking
out
across
the
wide
moonlighted
desert
and
up
at
the
twinkling
stars
wondered
if
it
was
fate
that
had
brought
him
to
her
rescue
if
it
could
be
possible
that
through
him
was
to
come
the
happiness
written
for
her
in
the
stars
there
the
wigwam
light
said
phil
presently
pausing
in
his
song
to
point
it
out
to
her
we
almost
there
i
never
forget
this
adventure
till
he
took
up
the
refrain
again
smiling
into
her
eyes
as
he
hummed
it
the
refrain
that
was
to
ring
through
lloyd
memory
for
many
a
year
to
come
whenever
she
thought
of
this
ride
across
the
moonlighted
desert
the
sun
grows
cold
and
the
stars
are
old
and
the
leaves
of
the
judgment
book
unfold
chapter
xvi
back
to
dixie
there
was
another
mark
on
the
kitchen
calendar
now
not
a
red
star
betokening
some
happy
event
to
come
but
a
deep
black
border
drawn
all
around
the
date
on
which
lloyd
visit
was
to
end
the
heavy
black
lines
marked
the
time
as
only
a
few
days
distant
it
was
saturday
again
a
week
after
the
excursion
to
the
indian
school
joyce
had
gone
down
to
the
ranch
for
armond
to
criticize
the
drawings
which
she
had
made
since
the
last
lesson
and
lloyd
on
the
seat
under
the
willows
was
waiting
for
phil
he
was
to
come
at
four
and
ride
over
to
one
of
the
neighbouring
orange
groves
with
her
she
had
a
book
in
her
hand
but
she
was
not
reading
she
was
listening
to
the
water
gurgle
through
the
little
into
the
lateral
and
thinking
of
all
that
had
happened
during
her
visit
especially
since
the
night
she
was
lost
on
the
desert
and
phil
had
found
her
monday
he
had
spent
the
entire
day
at
the
wigwam
and
since
joyce
had
forbidden
him
to
come
near
the
spot
where
the
washing
was
in
progress
he
and
lloyd
had
brought
a
jar
of
paste
and
the
little
wicker
table
down
to
this
very
seat
under
the
willows
and
had
mounted
all
her
photographs
in
the
book
she
had
bought
for
the
purpose
there
were
over
a
hundred
beginning
with
a
view
of
the
wigwam
and
ending
with
the
four
laughing
faces
around
the
table
on
the
balcony
of
coffee
al
restaurant
there
was
lloyd
on
her
pony
coming
back
from
the
duck
hunt
and
again
in
the
act
of
dropping
her
cherry
tart
there
was
mary
in
the
hammock
watching
the
bees
jack
in
his
irrigating
boots
and
holland
on
a
burro
there
were
a
dozen
different
pictures
of
joyce
and
family
groups
and
picnic
groups
in
which
was
represented
every
acquaintance
lloyd
had
made
in
arizona
turning
the
pages
was
like
living
over
the
pleasant
days
again
for
they
brought
the
scenes
vividly
before
her
when
the
last
picture
was
mounted
phil
proposed
that
they
write
an
appropriate
quotation
under
each
one
so
they
spent
another
hour
over
that
phil
suggesting
most
of
them
and
at
lloyd
request
writing
the
inscriptions
himself
in
his
strong
dashing
hand
some
of
his
apt
phrases
and
clever
parodies
seemed
really
brilliant
to
lloyd
and
they
had
laughed
and
joked
over
them
in
a
way
that
had
ripened
their
friendship
as
weeks
of
ordinary
intercourse
would
not
have
done
do
you
know
he
said
when
the
last
inscription
was
written
kept
count
and
i
in
of
these
pictures
you
wo
have
much
chance
to
forget
me
will
you
i
have
put
my
collection
in
a
book
but
i
have
a
better
reminder
of
this
last
month
than
all
these
put
together
opening
the
little
locket
that
hung
from
his
he
held
it
toward
her
just
long
enough
for
her
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
own
face
within
it
then
closing
the
locket
with
a
snap
he
put
the
fob
back
in
its
place
it
was
a
picture
he
had
taken
of
her
one
day
as
she
sat
on
this
same
seat
under
the
willows
watching
aunt
emily
braid
an
indian
basket
he
had
cut
out
a
tiny
circle
containing
her
head
from
the
rest
of
the
group
just
the
size
to
fit
in
the
locket
lloyd
leaning
forward
unsuspectingly
to
look
at
it
was
so
surprised
at
seeing
her
own
picture
that
a
deep
blush
stole
slowly
over
her
face
and
she
drew
back
in
confusion
not
knowing
what
to
say
if
he
had
asked
her
permission
to
put
her
picture
in
his
locket
she
would
have
refused
as
decidedly
as
she
had
refused
malcolm
the
tip
of
a
curl
to
carry
in
his
watch
but
phil
had
not
asked
for
anything
had
not
said
a
word
to
which
she
could
reply
as
she
had
replied
to
malcolm
he
had
showed
her
the
locket
in
the
same
way
that
rob
had
showed
her
the
clover
which
he
carried
yet
deep
down
in
her
heart
she
knew
that
there
was
a
difference
she
knew
that
her
father
would
not
like
phil
to
have
her
picture
in
his
locket
but
she
did
know
how
to
tell
him
so
it
was
only
an
instant
that
she
sat
in
shy
embarrassed
silence
with
her
heart
in
a
flutter
and
her
eyes
fastened
on
the
book
of
photographs
which
she
was
fingering
nervously
then
jack
came
out
with
a
pitcher
of
lemonade
and
the
opportunity
to
speak
passed
she
had
the
courage
to
bring
up
the
subject
afterward
phil
might
think
that
i
think
that
it
means
moah
than
it
does
she
told
herself
he
weahs
the
pictuah
just
as
he
would
elsie
and
if
i
tell
him
that
i
do
want
him
to
he
think
that
i
think
that
he
cares
for
me
the
way
that
malcolm
does
i
do
suppose
that
it
really
makes
any
difference
whethah
he
has
it
in
his
locket
or
not
he
did
not
mention
it
again
but
it
did
make
a
difference
the
consciousness
of
it
embarrassed
her
whenever
she
met
his
eyes
she
wondered
if
joyce
noticed
tuesday
he
came
again
and
read
aloud
all
morning
while
they
ironed
wednesday
he
spent
the
day
without
bringing
anything
as
an
excuse
thursday
he
rode
with
them
over
to
the
indian
reservation
her
pony
had
been
brought
back
to
her
the
day
after
it
ran
away
when
he
left
them
at
the
wigwam
that
evening
he
said
that
he
would
not
be
back
the
next
day
as
he
had
to
go
to
phoenix
but
that
he
would
be
up
saturday
afternoon
to
ride
with
lloyd
to
the
orange
grove
while
joyce
took
her
it
was
of
all
this
that
lloyd
was
thinking
now
as
she
sat
under
the
willows
and
she
was
thinking
too
of
the
tale
walton
told
her
of
the
three
weavers
the
tale
that
had
been
the
cause
of
the
shadow
club
turning
itself
into
the
order
of
hildegarde
walton
had
spoken
truly
when
she
said
that
little
girls
begin
very
early
sometimes
to
dream
about
that
land
of
romance
dreams
might
not
have
begun
so
soon
perhaps
had
it
not
been
for
the
meetings
of
the
shadow
club
at
when
ida
shane
fired
their
imaginations
with
the
stories
of
daisy
dale
and
the
heiress
of
dorn
and
made
lloyd
the
bearer
of
her
letters
to
her
edwardo
the
unhappy
ending
of
ida
romance
had
been
a
grave
warning
to
lloyd
and
the
story
of
hildegarde
in
the
three
weavers
was
often
in
her
thoughts
part
of
it
floated
through
her
memory
now
as
she
realized
with
a
start
how
large
a
place
phil
had
occupied
in
her
thoughts
the
last
week
hildegarde
worked
on
true
to
her
promise
but
there
came
a
time
when
a
face
shone
across
her
mirror
so
noble
and
fair
that
she
started
back
in
a
flutter
surely
is
he
she
whispered
to
her
father
eyes
are
so
blue
they
fill
all
my
dreams
but
old
hildgardmar
answered
her
he
measure
up
to
the
standard
set
by
the
sterling
yardstick
for
a
prince
to
be
that
is
just
what
papa
jack
would
ask
mused
lloyd
and
he
say
that
little
girls
outgrow
their
ideals
as
they
do
their
dresses
and
that
if
i
not
careful
that
i
make
the
same
mistake
that
hertha
and
huberta
did
besides
there
my
new
yeah
promise
for
a
moment
she
ceased
to
hear
the
gurgle
of
the
water
and
heard
instead
the
ticking
of
the
clock
in
the
long
at
locust
as
she
and
papa
jack
kept
watch
beside
the
embers
waiting
for
the
old
year
to
die
and
the
new
one
to
dawn
and
in
the
solemn
hush
she
heard
her
own
voice
repeating
hildegarde
promise
may
trust
me
fathah
i
will
not
cut
the
golden
warp
from
out
the
loom
until
i
a
woman
grown
have
woven
such
a
web
as
thou
thyself
shalt
say
is
worthy
of
a
prince
wearing
a
woman
grown
and
she
was
not
yet
quite
fourteen
i
not
be
the
only
one
of
all
the
lloyds
that
ca
be
trusted
to
keep
a
promise
she
said
aloud
with
a
proud
lifting
of
the
head
resolutely
shaking
herself
free
from
the
that
had
been
so
pleasant
she
picked
up
her
book
and
started
to
the
house
listening
to
aunt
emily
conversation
over
her
stocking
darning
about
the
commonplace
happenings
of
the
household
was
not
half
so
entertaining
as
letting
her
thoughts
stray
back
to
the
moonlight
ride
to
the
smile
in
phil
eyes
as
he
showed
her
the
locket
or
the
sound
of
his
voice
as
he
sang
from
the
desert
i
come
to
thee
there
were
a
dozen
such
memories
so
pleasant
to
dwell
upon
that
a
girl
of
less
would
not
have
pushed
them
aside
even
lloyd
found
it
difficult
to
do
it
like
trying
to
drive
away
a
flock
of
cherry
birds
she
thought
they
keep
coming
back
no
matter
how
often
you
say
but
i
let
them
stay
such
a
resolution
was
easier
to
make
than
to
keep
especially
as
she
was
expecting
to
see
phil
ride
up
to
the
door
at
any
moment
but
the
time
set
for
his
coming
passed
and
when
a
step
on
the
bridge
made
her
glance
up
it
was
joyce
she
saw
walking
along
slowly
usually
she
danced
in
after
her
with
armond
in
the
gayest
of
spirits
it
was
apparent
that
she
was
the
bearer
of
bad
news
oh
mamma
she
began
dropping
her
sketches
on
the
table
and
fumbling
to
find
her
they
all
so
worried
down
at
the
ranch
over
phil
lee
says
he
went
to
town
yesterday
morning
expecting
to
be
back
in
time
for
dinner
but
he
has
come
yet
jo
went
in
on
his
wheel
last
night
and
he
saw
him
at
one
of
those
places
where
they
play
faro
and
all
those
games
and
he
was
so
excited
over
his
winnings
that
he
did
even
see
jo
although
he
stood
and
watched
him
ever
so
long
this
morning
ellestad
went
in
and
he
came
across
him
wandering
about
the
streets
he
had
lost
not
only
every
cent
he
had
deposited
in
the
bank
but
he
put
up
his
horse
and
lost
that
too
he
did
have
any
way
to
get
out
to
the
ranch
he
would
drive
out
with
ellestad
he
was
so
mortified
and
disgusted
with
himself
that
he
said
he
could
face
them
all
he
said
his
father
would
never
trust
him
again
and
that
he
had
lost
not
only
his
father
confidence
but
our
respect
and
friendship
he
said
he
was
going
to
look
for
work
of
some
kind
he
did
care
what
and
it
make
any
difference
what
became
of
him
now
ellestad
left
him
at
a
hotel
and
he
felt
so
sorry
for
him
that
tired
as
he
was
he
rode
over
to
tempe
after
he
got
home
to
see
a
friend
of
his
who
is
a
civil
engineer
this
friend
is
going
to
start
on
an
expedition
next
week
surveying
for
some
canals
ellestad
persuaded
him
to
take
phil
in
his
party
and
give
him
some
work
phil
said
he
did
intend
to
touch
a
cent
of
his
usual
monthly
allowance
until
he
had
earned
back
all
he
lost
ellestad
telephoned
to
him
from
tempe
and
he
is
to
start
in
a
few
days
lee
says
that
losing
everything
is
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
phil
taught
him
a
lesson
he
never
forget
and
this
surveyor
is
just
the
sort
of
a
man
he
ought
to
be
with
clean
and
honourable
and
strong
as
joyce
finished
her
excited
telling
with
these
familiar
words
the
colour
that
had
faded
completely
out
of
lloyd
face
rushed
back
again
clean
and
honourable
and
strong
these
were
the
standards
of
the
yardstick
that
papa
jack
had
given
her
how
far
phil
had
failed
to
measure
up
to
the
last
two
notches
and
yet
ware
finished
the
unspoken
sentence
for
her
he
is
so
young
that
i
ca
help
feeling
that
with
something
to
keep
him
busy
and
some
one
to
take
a
helpful
interest
in
him
he
will
turn
out
all
right
he
has
so
many
fine
traits
i
am
sure
they
will
prevail
in
the
end
and
that
he
will
make
a
manly
man
after
all
joyce
openly
wiped
away
the
tears
that
came
at
the
thought
of
this
ending
to
their
happy
comradeship
but
lloyd
stole
away
to
the
tent
to
hide
her
face
in
her
pillow
and
sob
out
the
disappointment
of
her
sore
little
heart
she
would
never
see
him
again
she
told
herself
and
they
had
had
good
times
together
and
she
was
so
sorry
that
he
had
proved
so
weak
presently
as
she
lay
there
she
heard
holland
come
clattering
up
on
the
pony
inquiring
for
her
he
had
killed
a
snake
she
could
hear
him
telling
his
mother
and
had
brought
it
home
to
skin
for
lloyd
it
was
a
beautifully
marked
with
ten
rattles
and
now
she
could
have
a
purse
and
a
like
some
she
had
admired
in
phoenix
lloyd
listened
languidly
an
hour
ago
she
thought
i
would
have
been
out
there
the
instant
i
heard
him
call
i
would
have
been
admiring
the
snake
and
thanking
him
for
it
and
asking
a
hundred
questions
about
how
he
got
it
but
now
somehow
everything
seems
so
different
she
started
up
as
he
began
calling
her
i
wish
he
let
me
alone
she
exclaimed
impatiently
aunt
emily
will
think
it
strange
if
i
answer
for
she
knows
i
out
heah
but
i
do
feel
like
talking
to
anybody
or
taking
an
interest
in
anything
and
i
do
want
to
go
out
there
the
call
came
again
she
drew
back
the
and
looked
out
be
there
in
a
minute
holland
she
answered
trying
to
keep
the
impatience
out
of
her
voice
as
she
went
over
to
the
to
bathe
her
eyes
she
brushed
a
magazine
from
the
table
in
passing
it
was
the
one
phil
had
brought
up
several
days
before
to
read
aloud
she
replaced
it
carefully
almost
as
one
touches
the
belongings
of
some
one
who
is
dead
there
were
so
many
things
around
the
tent
to
remind
her
of
him
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
keep
him
out
of
her
thoughts
she
confessed
to
herself
that
it
was
growing
very
hard
to
keep
her
hildegarde
promise
she
started
to
whisper
it
as
one
might
repeat
some
strengthening
charm
you
may
trust
me
fathah
she
stopped
with
a
sob
this
sudden
ending
of
their
happy
companionship
was
going
to
shadow
all
the
rest
of
her
visit
as
her
eyes
met
her
reflection
in
the
little
mirror
hanging
against
the
side
of
the
tent
she
lifted
her
head
with
determination
and
looked
at
it
squarely
i
stop
thinking
about
it
all
the
time
she
said
defiantly
to
the
answering
eyes
it
will
spoil
all
my
visit
if
i
do
i
do
the
way
the
bees
do
when
things
get
into
the
hive
that
have
no
right
there
i
seal
it
up
tight
as
i
can
and
go
on
filling
the
other
cells
with
honey
doing
things
that
will
be
pleasant
to
remember
by
and
by
myself
take
an
interest
in
something
else
the
same
spirit
that
looked
from
the
eyes
of
the
proud
old
portraits
at
home
looked
back
at
her
now
from
the
eyes
in
the
mirror
that
strong
indomitable
spirit
of
her
ancestors
that
could
rise
even
to
the
conquering
of
that
hardest
of
all
enemies
self
when
occasion
demanded
it
running
out
to
the
where
holland
impatiently
awaited
her
she
threw
herself
into
the
interests
of
the
hour
so
resolutely
that
she
was
soon
absorbed
in
its
happenings
by
the
time
the
snake
was
skinned
and
the
skin
tacked
to
the
side
of
the
house
to
dry
she
had
gained
a
victory
that
left
her
stronger
for
all
her
life
to
come
she
had
compelled
herself
to
take
an
interest
in
the
affairs
of
others
when
she
wanted
to
mope
and
dream
instead
of
an
hour
of
selfish
musing
in
her
tent
she
had
had
an
hour
of
wholesome
laughter
and
chatter
outside
it
would
be
a
pleasant
time
to
look
back
upon
too
she
thought
complacently
remembering
mary
amusing
efforts
to
help
skin
the
snake
and
all
the
funny
things
that
had
been
said
well
that
hour
is
filled
all
right
lloyd
thought
i
see
how
much
moah
honey
i
can
store
away
befoah
i
leave
there
was
not
much
more
time
for
sherman
came
soon
with
the
announcement
that
they
would
leave
in
two
days
numerous
letters
had
passed
between
the
wigwam
and
the
mines
so
lloyd
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
when
her
father
arranged
for
her
and
joyce
to
spend
part
of
one
of
those
days
in
town
she
knew
that
when
they
came
back
they
would
find
a
long
rustic
arbour
built
in
the
rear
of
the
tents
a
rough
shack
of
cottonwood
poles
supporting
a
thatch
of
bamboo
and
underneath
would
be
a
dozen
or
more
hives
humming
with
thousands
of
bees
and
for
all
the
rest
of
their
little
lives
these
bees
would
spend
their
shining
hours
in
helping
joyce
on
toward
easier
times
and
the
city
of
her
desire
something
else
happened
that
day
while
they
were
in
town
phil
made
his
last
visit
before
starting
away
with
the
surveying
party
nobody
knew
what
passed
between
him
and
aunt
emily
in
the
old
wigwam
but
he
came
out
from
the
interview
smiling
so
full
of
hope
and
purpose
that
her
whispered
seemed
already
to
have
found
an
answer
she
told
the
girls
afterward
a
little
of
their
conversation
his
ambition
was
aroused
at
last
she
said
he
was
going
to
work
hard
all
summer
and
in
the
fall
go
back
to
school
not
the
military
academy
but
a
college
where
he
could
take
the
technical
course
this
friend
of
ellestad
recommended
phil
admired
this
man
immensely
and
she
was
sure
that
his
influence
would
be
exceedingly
helpful
she
was
sure
too
that
he
would
be
all
right
now
and
he
had
promised
to
write
to
her
every
week
as
phil
came
out
of
the
wigwam
he
heard
mary
voice
in
a
sort
of
happy
little
chant
as
she
watched
the
settling
of
the
bees
in
their
new
home
she
had
heard
nothing
of
phil
troubles
and
did
not
know
that
he
was
going
away
until
he
told
her
i
want
you
to
tell
lloyd
and
joyce
something
for
me
he
said
try
to
remember
just
these
words
please
tell
them
that
i
said
has
lost
his
precious
turquoises
but
will
win
them
back
again
some
can
you
remember
to
say
just
that
mary
nodded
gravely
yes
she
said
i
tell
them
then
her
lip
trembled
but
i
do
want
you
to
go
away
she
exclaimed
the
tears
beginning
to
come
are
you
ever
coming
back
not
for
a
long
time
he
answered
looking
away
toward
old
camelback
not
till
i
learned
the
lesson
that
you
told
me
about
the
first
time
i
saw
you
that
day
on
the
train
to
be
inflexible
when
i
strong
enough
to
keep
stiff
in
the
face
of
any
temptation
then
i
come
back
little
vicar
stooping
he
kissed
her
gently
on
each
plump
cheek
and
turned
hastily
away
she
watched
him
go
off
down
the
road
through
a
blur
of
tears
then
she
rubbed
her
sleeve
across
her
eyes
he
had
turned
to
look
back
and
seeing
the
disconsolate
little
figure
gazing
after
him
waved
his
hat
there
was
something
so
cheery
and
hopeful
in
the
swing
he
gave
it
that
mary
smiled
through
her
tears
and
answered
with
an
energetic
fluttering
of
her
white
sunbonnet
swung
high
by
its
one
string
joyce
delight
on
her
return
when
she
found
the
long
row
of
hives
was
something
good
to
see
she
could
hardly
speak
at
first
and
walked
from
one
hive
to
another
touching
each
as
she
passed
as
if
to
assure
herself
that
it
was
really
there
and
really
hers
joyce
is
so
by
her
good
fortune
that
she
is
almost
herself
said
holland
when
he
had
watched
her
start
on
her
third
round
of
inspection
that
the
truth
laughed
joyce
turning
to
face
lloyd
and
her
father
i
so
happy
that
i
do
know
what
i
doing
and
i
ca
begin
to
thank
you
properly
till
i
settled
down
a
little
there
was
no
need
of
spoken
thanks
when
her
face
was
so
eloquent
even
the
mistakes
she
made
in
setting
the
spoke
for
her
in
her
excitement
she
gave
sherman
two
forks
and
no
knife
and
lloyd
three
spoons
and
no
fork
she
made
the

oh

sorry
she
cried
when

were

but
if
you
were
as
happy
as
i
am
you
go
around
with
your
head
in

clouds
too
after

she
said
to
sherman
as
they
walked
out
to
the
hives
again
you
see
i
been
thinking
all
day
how
much
i
am
going
to
miss
lloyd
and
what
a
road
of
the
loving
heart
she
left
behind
her
on
this
visit
we
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it
and
we
talk
of
the
things
she
said
and
done
for
months
then
i
came
home
to
find
that
she
left
not
only
a
road
behind
her
but
one
that
will
reach
through
all
the
years
ahead
a
road
that
will
lead
straight
through
to
what
i
have
set
my
heart
on
doing
i
going
into
bee
culture
with
all
my
might
and
main
now
and
make
a
fortune
out
of
it
there
be
time
enough
after
that
to
carry
out
my
other
plans
to
think
she
added
as
lloyd
joined
them
when
i
first
came
to
the
wigwam
i
was
so
lonesome
and
discontented
that
i
wanted
to
die
now
i
would
change
places
with
any
other
girl
in
the
universe
not
even
with
me
cried
lloyd
in
surprise
thinking
of
all
she
had
and
all
that
she
had
done
no
not
even
with
you
answered
joyce
quoting
softly
for
me
the
desert
holds
more
than
kings
houses
could
offer
the
last
two
days
of
lloyd
visit
went
by
in
a
whirl
as
she
drove
away
with
her
father
in
the
open
carriage
that
had
been
sent
out
of
town
for
them
she
stood
up
to
look
back
and
wave
her
handkerchief
to
the
little
group
under
the
as
long
as
the
wigwam
was
in
sight
then
she
kept
turning
to
look
back
at
old
camelback
mountain
until
it
too
faded
from
sight
in
the
fading
day
then
she
settled
down
beside
her
father
and
looked
up
at
him
with
a
satisfied
smile
somehow
i
feel
as
if
my
visit

old

hildegarde
asked
sherman

visit

her
yes
said
lloyd
growing
grave
as
the
name
hildegarde
recalled
the
promise
that
had
been
so
hard
to
keep
and
the
victory
she
had
won
over
herself
the
day
she
turned
away
from
her
and
her
disappointment
to
interest
herself
in
other
things
she
felt
that
the
bees
had
shown
her
a
road
to
happiness
that
would
lead
her
out
of
many
a
trouble
in
the
years
to
come
she
had
only
to
follow
their
example
seal
up
whatever
had
no
right
in
her
life
hive
or
whatever
was
spoiling
her
happiness
and
fill
the
days
with
other
interests
oh

lots

baskets

exactly
he
answered
with
an
approving
nod
contented
people

the
most
comfortable
sort
to
live
with
and
such
an
ambition
as
yours
will
do

in
