brett
kissed
aunt
haicey
dry
cheek
shook
phillips
hand
and
swung
aboard
his
suitcase
was
on
one
of
the
seats
he
put
it
up
above
in
the
rack
and
sat
down
turned
to
wave
back
at
the
two
old
people
it
was
a
summer
morning
brett
leaned
back
and
watched
the
country
slide
by
it
was
nice
country
brett
thought
mostly
in
corn
some
cattle
and
away
in
the
distance
the
hazy
blue
hills
now
he
would
see
what
was
on
the
other
side
of
them
the
cities
the
mountains
and
the
ocean
up
until
now
all
he
knew
about
anything
outside
of
casperton
was
what
read
or
seen
pictures
of
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
chopping
wood
and
milking
cows
back
in
casperton
they
might
as
well
not
have
existed
they
were
just
words
and
pictures
printed
on
paper
but
he
did
want
to
just
read
about
them
he
wanted
to
see
for
himself
had
come
to
see
him
off
she
was
probably
still
mad
about
yesterday
she
had
been
sitting
at
the
counter
at
the
club
rexall
drinking
a
soda
and
reading
a
movie
magazine
with
a
big
picture
of
an
impossibly
pretty
face
on
the
cover
the
kind
you
never
see
just
walking
down
the
street
he
had
taken
the
next
stool
and
ordered
a
coke
why
do
you
read
something
good
instead
of
that
pap
he
asked
her
something
good
you
mean
something
dry
i
guess
and
do
call
it
that
word
it
does
sound
polite
what
does
it
say
that
somebody
named
doll
starr
is
fed
up
with
glamor
and
longs
for
a
simple
home
in
the
country
and
lots
of
kids
then
why
does
she
move
to
casperton
you
would
understand
said
he
took
the
magazine
leafed
through
it
look
at
this
all
about
people
who
give
parties
that
cost
thousands
of
dollars
and
fly
all
over
the
world
having
affairs
with
each
other
and
committing
suicide
and
getting
divorced
it
like
reading
about
martians
i
still
like
to
read
about
the
stars
there
nothing
wrong
with
it
reading
all
that
junk
just
makes
you
dissatisfied
you
want
to
do
your
hair
up
crazy
like
the
pictures
in
the
magazines
and
wear
clothes
bent
her
straw
double
she
stood
up
and
took
her
shopping
bag
i
very
glad
to
know
you
think
my
clothes
are
weird
you
taking
everything
i
say
personally
look
he
showed
her
a
advertisement
on
the
back
cover
of
the
magazine
look
at
this
here
a
man
supposed
to
be
cooking
steaks
on
some
kind
of
grill
he
looks
like
a
movie
star
he
dressed
up
like
he
was
going
to
get
married
there
not
a
wrinkle
anywhere
there
not
a
spot
on
that
apron
there
is
even
a
grease
spot
on
the
frying
pan
the
lawn
is
as
smooth
as
a
billiard
table
there
his
son
he
looks
just
like
his
pop
except
that
he
not
grey
at
the
temples
did
you
ever
really
see
a
man
that
handsome
or
hair
that
was
just
silver
over
the
ears
and
the
rest
glossy
black
the
daughter
looks
like
a
movie
starlet
and
her
mom
is
exactly
the
same
except
that
she
has
that
grey
streak
in
front
to
match
her
husband
you
can
see
the
car
in
the
drive
the
treads
of
the
tires
must
have
just
been
scrubbed
they
not
even
dusty
there
not
a
pebble
out
of
place
all
the
flowers
are
in
full
bloom
no
dead
ones
no
leaves
on
the
lawn
no
dry
twigs
showing
on
the
trees
that
other
house
in
the
background
looks
like
a
palace
and
the
man
with
the
rake
looking
over
the
fence
he
looks
like
this
one
twin
brother
and
he
out
raking
leaves
in
brand
new
clothes
grabbed
her
magazine
you
just
seem
to
hate
everything
that
nicer
than
this
messy
town
i
do
think
it
nicer
i
like
you
your
hair
is
always
perfectly
smooth
and
you
got
a
mended
place
on
your
dress
and
you
feel
human
you
smell
human
oh
turned
and
flounced
out
of
the
drug
store
brett
shifted
in
the
dusty
plush
seat
and
looked
around
there
were
a
few
other
people
in
the
car
an
old
man
was
reading
a
newspaper
two
old
ladies
whispered
together
there
was
a
woman
of
about
thirty
with
a
kid
and
some
others
they
did
look
like
magazine
pictures
any
of
them
he
tried
to
picture
them
doing
the
things
you
read
in
newspapers
the
old
ladies
putting
poison
in
somebody
tea
the
old
man
giving
orders
to
start
a
war
he
thought
about
babies
in
houses
in
cities
and
airplanes
flying
over
and
bombs
falling
down
huge
explosive
bombs
blam
buildings
fall
in
pieces
of
glass
and
stone
fly
through
the
air
the
babies
are
blown
up
along
with
everything
else
but
the
kind
of
people
he
knew
could
do
anything
like
that
they
liked
to
loaf
and
eat
and
talk
and
drink
beer
and
buy
a
new
tractor
or
refrigerator
and
go
fishing
and
if
they
ever
got
mad
and
hit
somebody
afterwards
they
were
embarrassed
and
wanted
to
shake
hands
the
train
slowed
came
to
a
shuddery
stop
through
the
window
he
saw
a
building
with
the
words
baxter
junction
painted
across
it
there
were
a
few
faded
posters
on
a
bulletin
board
an
old
man
was
sitting
on
a
bench
waiting
the
two
old
ladies
got
off
and
a
boy
in
blue
jeans
got
on
the
train
started
up
brett
folded
his
jacket
and
tucked
it
under
his
head
and
tried
to
doze
off
brett
awoke
yawned
sat
up
the
train
was
slowing
he
remembered
you
could
use
the
toilets
while
the
train
was
stopped
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
end
of
the
car
the
door
was
jammed
he
got
it
open
and
went
inside
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
the
train
was
going
slower
clack
clack
he
washed
his
hands
then
pulled
at
the
door
it
was
stuck
he
pulled
harder
the
handle
was
too
small
it
was
hard
to
get
hold
of
the
train
came
to
a
halt
brett
braced
himself
and
strained
against
the
door
it
did
budge
he
looked
out
the
grimy
window
the
sun
was
getting
lower
it
was
about
he
guessed
he
could
see
anything
but
some
fields
outside
in
the
corridor
there
were
footsteps
he
started
to
call
but
then
did
it
would
be
too
embarrassing
pounding
on
the
door
and
yelling
let
me
out
i
stuck
in
the
toilet
he
tried
to
rattle
the
door
it
did
rattle
somebody
was
dragging
something
heavy
past
the
door
mail
bags
maybe
he
better
yell
but
dammit
the
door
could
be
all
that
hard
to
open
he
studied
the
latch
all
he
had
to
do
was
turn
it
he
got
a
good
grip
and
twisted
nothing
he
heard
the
mail
bag
and
then
another
one
to
heck
with
it
he
yell
he
wait
until
he
heard
the
footsteps
pass
the
door
again
and
then
he
make
some
noise
brett
waited
it
was
quiet
now
he
rapped
on
the
door
anyway
no
answer
maybe
there
was
nobody
left
in
the
car
in
a
minute
the
train
would
start
up
and
he
be
stuck
here
until
the
next
stop
he
banged
on
the
door
hey
the
door
is
stuck
it
sounded
foolish
he
listened
it
was
very
quiet
he
pounded
again
the
car
creaked
once
he
put
his
ear
to
the
door
he
could
hear
anything
he
turned
back
to
the
window
there
was
no
one
in
sight
he
put
his
cheek
flat
against
it
looked
along
the
car
he
saw
only
dry
fields
he
turned
around
and
gave
the
door
a
good
kick
if
he
damaged
it
it
was
too
bad
the
railroad
should
have
defective
locks
on
the
doors
if
they
tried
to
make
him
pay
for
it
he
tell
them
they
were
lucky
he
did
sue
the
railroad
he
braced
himself
against
the
opposite
wall
drew
his
foot
back
and
kicked
hard
at
the
lock
something
broke
he
pulled
the
door
open
he
was
looking
out
the
open
door
and
through
the
window
beyond
there
was
no
platform
just
the
same
dry
fields
he
could
see
on
the
other
side
he
came
out
and
went
along
to
his
seat
the
car
was
empty
now
he
looked
out
the
window
why
had
the
train
stopped
here
maybe
there
was
some
kind
of
trouble
with
the
engine
it
had
been
sitting
here
for
ten
minutes
or
so
now
brett
got
up
and
went
along
to
the
door
stepped
down
onto
the
iron
step
leaning
out
he
could
see
the
train
stretching
along
ahead
one
car
two
cars
there
was
no
engine
maybe
he
was
turned
around
he
looked
the
other
way
there
were
three
cars
no
engine
there
either
he
must
be
on
some
kind
of
siding
brett
stepped
back
inside
and
pushed
through
into
the
next
car
it
was
empty
he
walked
along
the
length
of
it
into
the
next
car
it
was
empty
too
he
went
back
through
the
two
cars
and
his
own
car
and
on
all
the
way
to
the
end
of
the
train
all
the
cars
were
empty
he
stood
on
the
platform
at
the
end
of
the
last
car
and
looked
back
along
the
rails
they
ran
straight
through
the
dry
fields
right
to
the
horizon
he
stepped
down
to
the
ground
went
along
the
cindery
bed
to
the
front
of
the
train
stepping
on
the
ends
of
the
wooden
ties
the
coupling
stood
open
the
tall
dusty
coach
stood
silently
on
its
iron
wheels
waiting
ahead
the
tracks
went
on
and
stopped
he
walked
along
the
ties
following
the
iron
rails
shiny
on
top
and
brown
with
rust
on
the
sides
a
hundred
feet
from
the
train
they
ended
the
cinders
went
on
another
ten
feet
and
petered
out
beyond
the
fields
closed
in
brett
looked
up
at
the
sun
it
was
lower
now
in
the
west
its
light
getting
yellow
and
he
turned
and
looked
back
at
the
train
the
cars
stood
high
and
prim
empty
silent
he
walked
back
climbed
in
got
his
bag
down
from
the
rack
pulled
on
his
jacket
he
jumped
down
to
the
cinders
followed
them
to
where
they
ended
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
pushed
between
the
stalks
eastward
across
the
field
he
could
see
what
looked
like
a
smudge
on
the
far
horizon
he
walked
until
dark
then
made
himself
a
nest
in
the
dead
stalks
and
went
to
sleep
he
lay
on
his
back
looking
up
at
pink
dawn
clouds
around
him
dry
stalks
rustled
in
a
faint
stir
of
air
he
felt
crumbly
earth
under
his
fingers
he
sat
up
reached
out
and
broke
off
a
stalk
it
crumbled
into
fragile
chips
he
wondered
what
it
was
it
was
any
crop
he
ever
seen
before
he
stood
looked
around
the
field
went
on
and
on
dead
flat
a
locust
came
whirring
toward
him
plumped
to
earth
at
his
feet
he
picked
it
up
long
elbowed
legs
groped
at
his
fingers
aimlessly
he
tossed
the
insect
in
the
air
it
fluttered
away
to
the
east
the
smudge
was
clearer
now
it
seemed
to
be
a
grey
wall
far
away
a
city
he
picked
up
his
bag
and
started
on
he
was
getting
hungry
he
had
eaten
since
the
previous
morning
he
was
thirsty
too
the
city
could
be
more
than
three
hours
walk
he
tramped
along
the
dry
plants
crackling
under
his
feet
little
puffs
of
dust
rising
from
the
dry
ground
he
thought
about
the
rails
running
across
the
empty
fields
ending
he
had
heard
the
locomotive
groaning
up
ahead
as
the
train
slowed
and
there
had
been
feet
in
the
corridor
where
had
they
gone
he
thought
of
the
train
casperton
aunt
haicey
phillips
they
seemed
very
far
away
something
remembered
from
long
ago
up
above
the
sun
was
hot
that
was
real
the
rest
seemed
unimportant
ahead
there
was
a
city
he
would
walk
until
he
came
to
it
he
tried
to
think
of
other
things
television
crowds
of
people
money
the
tattered
paper
and
the
worn
silver
only
the
sun
and
the
dusty
plain
and
the
dead
plants
were
real
now
he
could
see
them
feel
them
and
the
suitcase
it
was
heavy
he
shifted
hands
kept
going
there
was
something
white
on
the
ground
ahead
a
small
shiny
surface
protruding
from
the
earth
brett
dropped
the
suitcase
went
down
on
one
knee
dug
into
the
dry
soil
pulled
out
a
china
teacup
the
handle
missing
caked
dirt
crumbled
away
under
his
thumb
leaving
the
surface
clean
he
looked
at
the
bottom
of
the
cup
it
was
unmarked
why
just
one
teacup
he
wondered
here
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
he
dropped
it
took
up
his
suitcase
and
went
on
after
that
he
watched
the
ground
more
closely
he
found
a
shoe
it
was
badly
weathered
but
the
sole
was
good
it
was
a
work
shoe
size
who
had
dropped
it
here
he
thought
of
other
lone
shoes
he
had
seen
lying
at
the
roadside
or
in
alleys
how
did
they
get
there
half
an
hour
later
he
detoured
around
the
rusted
front
fender
of
an
car
he
looked
around
for
the
rest
of
the
car
but
saw
nothing
the
wall
was
closer
now
perhaps
five
miles
more
a
scrap
of
white
paper
fluttered
across
the
field
in
a
stir
of
air
he
saw
another
more
blowing
along
in
the
fitful
gusts
he
ran
a
few
steps
caught
one
smoothed
it
out
buy
now
pay
later
he
picked
up
another
prepare
to
meet
god
a
third
said
win
with
willkie
the
wall
loomed
above
him
smooth
and
grey
dust
was
caked
on
his
skin
and
clothes
and
as
he
walked
he
brushed
at
himself
absently
the
suitcase
dragged
at
his
arm
thumped
against
his
shin
he
was
very
hungry
and
thirsty
he
sniffed
the
air
instinctively
searching
for
the
odors
of
food
he
had
been
following
the
wall
for
a
long
time
searching
for
an
opening
it
curved
away
from
him
rising
vertically
from
the
level
earth
its
surface
was
porous
unadorned
too
smooth
to
climb
it
was
brett
estimated
twenty
feet
high
if
there
were
anything
to
make
a
ladder
from
ahead
he
saw
a
wide
gate
flanked
by
grey
columns
he
came
up
to
it
put
the
suitcase
down
and
wiped
at
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
through
the
opening
in
the
wall
a
paved
street
was
visible
and
the
facades
of
buildings
those
on
the
street
before
him
were
low
not
more
than
one
or
two
stories
but
behind
them
taller
towers
reared
up
there
were
no
people
in
sight
no
sounds
stirred
the
hot
air
brett
picked
up
his
bag
and
passed
through
the
gate
for
the
next
hour
he
walked
empty
pavements
listening
to
the
echoes
of
his
footsteps
against
brownstone
fronts
empty
shop
windows
curtained
glass
doors
and
here
and
there
a
vacant
lot
and
desolate
he
paused
at
cross
streets
looked
down
long
vacant
ways
now
and
then
a
distant
sound
came
to
him
the
lonely
honk
of
a
horn
a
faintly
tolling
bell
a
clatter
of
hooves
he
came
to
a
narrow
alley
that
cut
like
a
dark
canyon
between
blank
walls
he
stood
at
its
mouth
listening
to
a
distant
murmur
like
a
crowd
at
a
funeral
he
turned
down
the
narrow
way
it
went
straight
for
a
few
yards
then
twisted
as
he
followed
its
turnings
the
crowd
noise
gradually
grew
louder
he
could
make
out
individual
voices
now
an
occasional
word
above
the
hubbub
he
started
to
hurry
eager
to
find
someone
to
talk
to
abruptly
the
voices
hundreds
of
voices
he
thought
rose
in
a
roar
a
yaaayyyyy
brett
thought
of
a
stadium
crowd
as
the
home
team
trotted
onto
the
field
he
could
hear
a
band
now
a
shrilling
of
brass
the
clatter
and
thump
of
percussion
instruments
now
he
could
see
the
mouth
of
the
alley
ahead
a
sunny
street
hung
with
bunting
the
backs
of
people
and
over
their
heads
the
rhythmic
bobbing
of
a
passing
procession
tall
shakos
and
guidons
in
rows
two
tall
poles
with
a
streamer
between
them
swung
into
view
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
tall
red
letters
for
our
side
he
moved
closer
edged
up
behind
the
crowd
a
phalanx
of
men
approached
walking
stiffly
fez
tassels
swinging
a
small
boy
darted
out
into
the
street
loped
along
at
their
side
the
music
screeched
and
wheezed
brett
tapped
the
man
before
him
what
it
all
about
he
could
hear
his
own
voice
the
man
ignored
him
brett
moved
along
behind
the
crowd
looking
for
a
vantage
point
or
a
thinning
in
the
ranks
there
seemed
to
be
fewer
people
ahead
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
crowd
moved
on
a
few
yards
stood
at
the
curb
the
had
passed
now
and
a
group
of
girls
in
satin
blouses
and
black
boots
and
white
fur
caps
glided
into
view
silent
expressionless
as
they
reached
a
point
fifty
feet
from
brett
they
broke
abruptly
into
a
strutting
prance
knees
high
hips
flirting
tossing
shining
batons
high
catching
them
twirling
them
and
up
again
brett
craned
his
neck
looking
for
tv
cameras
the
crowd
lining
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
stood
in
solid
ranks
drably
clad
eyes
following
the
procession
mouths
working
a
fat
man
in
a
rumpled
suit
and
a
panama
hat
squeezed
to
the
front
stood
picking
his
teeth
somehow
he
seemed
out
of
place
among
the
others
behind
the
spectators
the
store
fronts
looked
normal
dowdy
brick
and
mismatched
glass
and
oxidizing
aluminum
dusty
windows
and
cluttered
displays
of
cardboard
a
faded
sign
that
read
today
only
prices
slashed
to
brett
left
the
sidewalk
stretched
empty
to
his
right
the
crowd
was
packed
close
the
shout
rising
and
falling
now
a
rank
of
policemen
followed
the
majorettes
swinging
along
silently
behind
them
over
them
a
piece
of
paper
blew
along
the
street
brett
turned
to
the
man
on
his
right
pardon
me
can
you
tell
me
the
name
of
this
town
the
man
ignored
him
brett
tapped
the
man
shoulder
hey
what
town
is
this
the
man
took
off
his
hat
whirled
it
overhead
then
threw
it
up
it
sailed
away
over
the
crowd
lost
brett
wondered
briefly
how
people
who
threw
their
hats
ever
recovered
them
but
then
nobody
he
knew
would
throw
his
hat
you
mind
telling
me
the
name
of
this
place
brett
said
as
he
took
the
man
arm
pulled
the
man
rotated
toward
brett
leaning
heavily
against
him
brett
stepped
back
the
man
fell
lay
stiffly
his
arms
moving
his
eyes
and
mouth
open
ahhhhh
he
said
awww
jawww
brett
stooped
quickly
i
sorry
he
cried
he
looked
around
help
this
man
nobody
was
watching
the
next
man
a
few
feet
away
stood
close
against
his
neighbor
hatless
his
jaw
moving
this
man
sick
said
brett
tugging
at
the
man
arm
he
fell
the
man
eyes
moved
reluctantly
to
brett
none
of
my
business
he
muttered
wo
anybody
give
me
a
hand
probably
a
drunk
behind
brett
a
voice
called
in
a
penetrating
whisper
quick
you
get
into
the
alley
he
turned
a
gaunt
man
of
about
thirty
with
sparse
reddish
hair
perspiration
glistening
on
his
upper
lip
stood
at
the
mouth
of
a
narrow
way
like
the
one
brett
had
come
through
he
wore
a
grimy
pale
yellow
shirt
with
a
collar
limp
and
dark
green
soft
leather
boots
scuffed
and
dirty
with
limp
tops
that
drooped
over
his
ankles
he
gestured
drew
back
into
the
alley
in
here
brett
went
toward
him
this
man
come
on
you
fool
the
man
took
brett
arm
pulled
him
deeper
into
the
dark
passage
brett
resisted
wait
a
minute
that
fellow
he
tried
to
point
do
you
know
yet
the
spoke
with
a
strange
accent
golems
you
got
to
get
out
of
sight
before
the
the
man
froze
flattened
himself
against
the
wall
automatically
brett
moved
to
a
place
beside
him
the
man
head
was
twisted
toward
the
alley
mouth
the
tendons
in
his
weathered
neck
stood
out
he
had
a
stubble
of
beard
brett
could
smell
him
standing
this
close
he
edged
away
what
do
make
a
sound
do
move
you
idiot
his
voice
was
a
thin
hiss
brett
followed
the
other
eyes
toward
the
sunny
street
the
fallen
man
lay
on
the
pavement
moving
feebly
eyes
open
something
moved
up
to
him
a
translucent
brownish
shape
like
muddy
water
it
hovered
for
a
moment
then
dropped
on
the
man
like
a
breaking
wave
flowed
around
him
the
body
shifted
rotating
stiffly
then
tilted
upright
the
sun
struck
through
the
fluid
shape
that
flowed
down
now
amber
highlights
twinkling
to
form
itself
into
the
crested
wave
flow
away
what
the
hell
come
on
the
turned
trotted
silently
toward
the
shadowy
bend
under
the
high
grey
walls
he
looked
back
beckoned
impatiently
passed
out
of
sight
around
the
turn
brett
came
up
behind
him
saw
a
wide
avenue
tall
trees
with
chartreuse
springtime
leaves
a
fence
and
beyond
it
rolling
green
lawns
there
were
no
people
in
sight
wait
a
minute
what
is
this
place
his
companion
turned
eyes
on
brett
how
long
have
you
been
here
he
asked
how
did
you
get
in
i
came
through
a
gate
just
about
an
hour
ago
i
knew
you
were
a
man
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
talking
to
the
golem

the
i
been
here

months
maybe
more
we
got
to
get
out
of
sight

want
food
there
a
place
he
jerked
his
thumb
come
on
time
to
talk
later
brett
followed
him
they
turned
down
a
side
street
pushed
through
the
door
of
a
dingy
cafe
it
banged
behind
them
there
were
tables
stools
at
a
bar
a
dusty
juke
box
they
took
seats
at
a
table
the
groped
under
the
table
pulled
off
a
shoe
hammered
it
against
the
wall
he
cocked
his
head
listening
the
silence
was
absolute
he
hammered
again
there
was
a
clash
of
crockery
from
beyond
the
kitchen
door
now
do
say
anything
the
said
he
eyed
the
door
behind
the
counter
expectantly
it
flew
open
a
girl
with
red
cheeks
and
untidy
hair
dressed
in
a
green
waitress
uniform
appeared
swept
up
to
the
table
pad
and
pencil
in
hand
coffee
and
a
ham
sandwich
said
the
brett
said

the
girl
glanced
at
him
briefly
jotted
hastily
whisked
away
i
saw
them
here
the
first
day
the
said
it
was
a
piece
of
luck
i
saw
how
the
gels
started
it
up
they
were
big
ones
not
like
the
as
soon
as
they
were
finished
i
came
in
and
tried
the
same
thing
it
worked
i
used
the
golem
lines
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
brett
said
i
going
to
ask
that
girl
do
say
anything
to
her
it
might
spoil
everything
the
whole
sequence
might
collapse
or
it
might
call
the
gels
i
not
sure
you
can
have
the
food
when
it
comes
back
with
it
why
do
you
say

he
looked
at
brett
strangely
i
show
you
brett
could
smell
food
now
his
mouth
watered
he
had
eaten
for
hours
care
that

thing
the
said

quiet
and
stay
out
of
sight
and
you
can
live
like

hardest
but
here
the
girl
reappeared
a
tray
balanced
on
one
arm
a
heavy
cup
and
saucer
in
the
other
hand
she
clattered
them
down
on
the
table
took
you
long
enough
the
said
the
girl
sniffed
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
and
the
darted
out
a
stiff
finger
jabbed
her
under
the
ribs
she
stood
mouth
open
frozen
brett
half
rose
he
crazy

said

waste
your
breath
brett
host
was
looking
at
him
triumphantly

call

he
stood
up
reached
out
and
undid
the
top
buttons
of
the
green
uniform
the
waitress
stood
leaning
slightly
forward
unmoving
the
blouse
fell
open
exposing
round
white
breasts
unadorned
blind
a
doll
said
the
a
puppet
a
golem
brett
stared
at
her
the
damp
curls
at
her
temple
the
tip
of
her
tongue
behind
her
teeth
the
tiny
red
veins
in
her
round
cheeks
and
the
white
skin
curving
that
a
quick
way
to
tell
said
the
the
teat
is
smooth
he
rebuttoned
the
uniform
then
jabbed
again
at
the
ribs
she
straightened

her
hair

golems
doing
things
like

their
brows
starting
back
in
alarm
looking
askance
and
standing
arms
akimbo
and
they
have
things
like
pursed
lips

mirthless
laughter

what
a

play
on
film
a
moving
picture
a
picture
that
moves
that
right
this
is
something
the
priests
told
you
about
dhuva
seemed
to
be
holding
in
his
mirth
everybody
seen
movies
dhuva
burst
out
laughing
those
priests
he
said
they
the
same
everywhere
i
see
the
stories
they
tell
and
people
believe
them
what
else
priests
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
dhuva
composed
his
features
what
do
they
tell
you
about
grat
and
the
wheel
grat
what
that
the
the
one
dhuva
made
a
sign
caught
himself
just
habit
he
said
i
do
believe
that
rubbish
never
did
i
suppose
you
talking
about
god
brett
said
i
do
know
about
god

me
about
it
he
the
creator
of
the
world
he
well
superhuman
he
knows
everything
that
happens
and
when
you
die
if
you
led
a
good
life
you
meet
god
in
heaven
where
that
it
brett
waved
a
hand
vaguely
up
above
but
you
said
there
was
just
emptiness
up
above
dhuva
recalled
and
some
other
worlds
whirling
around
like
islands
adrift
in
the
sea
well
never
mind
dhuva
held
up
his
hands
our
priests
are
liars
too
all
that
balderdash
about
the
wheel
and
the
river
of
fire
it
just
as
bad
as
your
hivvel
or
whatever
you
called
it
and
our
grat
and
your
mud
or
gog
they
the
same
dhuva
head
went
up
what
that
i
did
hear
anything
dhuva
got
to
his
feet
turned
to
the
door
brett
rose
a
towering
brown
shape
glassy
and
transparent
hung
in
the
door
its
surface
rippling
dhuva
whirled
leaped
past
brett
dived
for
the
rear
door
brett
stood
frozen
the
shape
flowed
swift
as
quicksilver
caught
dhuva
in
engulfed
him
for
an
instant
brett
saw
the
thin
figure
legs
kicking
upended
within
the
muddy
form
of
the
gel
then
the
turbid
wave
swept
across
to
the
door
sloshed
it
aside
disappeared
dhuva
was
gone
brett
stood
rooted
staring
at
the
doorway
a
bar
of
sunlight
fell
across
the
dusty
floor
a
brown
mouse
ran
along
the
baseboard
it
was
very
quiet
brett
went
to
the
door
through
which
the
gel
had
disappeared
hesitated
a
moment
then
thrust
it
open
he
was
looking
down
into
a
great
dark
pit
acres
in
extent
its
sides
riddled
with
holes
the
amputated
ends
of
water
and
sewage
lines
and
power
cables
dangling
far
below
light
glistened
from
the
surface
of
a
black
pool
a
few
feet
away
the
waitress
stood
unmoving
in
the
dark
on
a
narrow
strip
of
linoleum
at
her
feet
the
chasm
yawned
the
edge
of
the
floor
was
ragged
as
though
it
had
been
gnawed
away
by
rats
there
was
no
sign
of
dhuva
brett
stepped
back
into
the
dining
room
let
the
door
swing
shut
he
took
a
deep
breath
picked
up
a
paper
napkin
from
a
table
and
wiped
his
forehead
dropped
the
napkin
on
the
floor
and
went
out
into
the
street
his
suitcase
forgotten
now
at
the
corner
he
turned
walked
along
past
silent
shop
windows
crowded
with
home
permanents
sun
glasses
fingernail
polish
suntan
lotion
paper
cartons
streamers
plastic
toys
garments
of
synthetic
fiber
home
remedies
beauty
aids
popular
music
greeting
cards
at
the
next
corner
he
stopped
looking
down
the
silent
streets
nothing
moved
brett
went
to
a
window
in
a
grey
concrete
wall
pulled
himself
up
to
peer
through
the
dusty
pane
saw
a
room
filled
with
tailor
forms
garment
racks
a
bicycle
bundled
back
issues
of
magazines
without
covers
he
went
along
to
a
door
it
was
solid
painted
shut
the
next
door
looked
easier
he
wrenched
at
the
tarnished
brass
nob
then
stepped
back
and
kicked
the
door
with
a
hollow
sound
the
door
fell
inward
taking
with
it
the
jamb
brett
stood
staring
at
the
gaping
opening
a
fragment
of
masonry
dropped
with
a
dry
clink
brett
stepped
through
the
breach
in
the
grey
facade
the
black
pool
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit
winked
a
flicker
of
light
back
at
him
in
the
deep
gloom
around
him
the
high
walls
of
the
block
of
buildings
loomed
in
silhouette
the
squares
of
the
windows
were
ranks
of
luminous
blue
against
the
dark
dust
motes
danced
in
shafts
of
sunlight
far
above
the
roof
was
dimly
visible
a
spidery
tangle
of
trusswork
and
below
was
the
abyss
at
brett
feet
the
stump
of
a
heavy
brass
rail
projected
an
inch
from
the
floor
it
was
long
enough
brett
thought
to
give
firm
anchor
to
a
rope
somewhere
below
dhuva
a
stranger
who
had
befriended
him
lay
in
the
grip
of
the
gels
he
would
do
what
he
could
but
he
needed
equipment
and
help
first
he
would
find
a
store
with
rope
guns
knives
he
would
the
broken
edge
of
masonry
where
the
door
had
been
caught
his
eye
the
shell
of
the
wall
exposed
where
the
door
frame
had
torn
away
was
brett
reached
up
broke
off
a
piece
the
outer
face
the
side
that
showed
on
the
street
was
smooth
the
back
was
porous
nibbled
brett
stepped
outside
examined
the
wall
he
kicked
at
the
grey
surface
a
great
piece
of
wall
six
feet
high
broke
into
fragments
fell
on
the
sidewalk
with
a
crash
driving
out
a
puff
of
dust
another
section
fell
one
piece
of
it
skidded
away
clattered
down
into
the
depths
brett
heard
a
distant
splash
he
looked
at
the
great
jagged
opening
in
the
wall
like
a
jigsaw
picture
with
a
piece
missing
he
turned
and
started
off
at
a
trot
his
mouth
dry
his
pulse
thumping
painfully
in
his
chest
two
blocks
from
the
hollow
building
brett
slowed
to
a
walk
his
footsteps
echoing
in
the
empty
street
he
looked
into
each
store
window
as
he
passed
there
were
artificial
legs
bottles
of
colored
water
immense
dolls
wigs
glass
eyes
but
no
rope
brett
tried
to
think
what
kind
of
store
would
handle
rope
a
marine
supply
company
maybe
but
where
would
he
find
one
perhaps
it
would
be
easiest
to
look
in
a
telephone
book
ahead
he
saw
a
sign
lettered
hotel
brett
went
up
to
the
revolving
door
pushed
inside
he
was
in
a
dim
lobby
with
double
doors
leading
into
a
bar
on
his
right
the
cage
of
an
elevator
directly
before
him
flanked
by
tall
urns
of
sand
and
an
ascending
staircase
on
the
left
was
a
dark
reception
desk
behind
the
desk
a
man
stood
silently
waiting
brett
felt
a
wild
surge
of
relief
those
things
those
gels
he
called
starting
across
the
room
my
friend
he
broke
off
the
clerk
stood
staring
over
brett
shoulder
holding
a
pen
poised
over
a
book
brett
reached
out
took
the
pen
the
finger
curled
stiffly
around
nothing
a
golem
brett
turned
away
went
into
the
bar
vacant
stools
were
ranged
before
a
dark
mirror
at
the
tables
empty
glasses
stood
before
empty
chairs
brett
started
as
he
heard
the
revolving
door
suddenly
soft
light
bathed
the
lobby
behind
him
somewhere
a
piano
tinkled
than
you
with
a
distant
clatter
of
closing
doors
the
elevator
came
to
life
brett
hugged
a
shadowed
corner
saw
a
fat
man
in
a
limp
seersucker
suit
cross
to
the
reception
desk
he
had
a
red
face
a
bald
scalp
blotched
with
large
brown
freckles
the
clerk
inclined
his
head
blandly
ah
yes
sir
a
nice
double
with
bath
brett
heard
the
unctuous
voice
of
the
clerk
as
he
offered
the
pen
the
fat
man
took
it
scrawled
something
in
the
register
at
fourteen
dollars
the
clerk
murmured
he
smiled
dinged
the
bell
a
boy
in
tight
green
tunic
and
trousers
and
a
pillbox
cap
with
a
chin
strap
pushed
through
a
door
beside
the
desk
took
the
key
led
the
way
to
the
elevator
the
fat
man
entered
through
the
openwork
of
the
shaft
brett
watched
as
the
elevator
car
rose
greasy
cables
trembling
and
swaying
he
started
back
across
the
lobby
and
stopped
dead
a
wet
brown
shape
had
appeared
in
the
entrance
it
flowed
across
the
rug
to
the
bellhop
face
blank
the
golem
turned
back
to
its
door
above
brett
heard
the
elevator
stop
doors
clashed
the
clerk
stood
poised
behind
the
desk
the
gel
hovered
then
flowed
away
the
piano
was
silent
now
the
lights
burned
a
soft
glow
then
winked
out
brett
thought
about
the
fat
man
he
had
seen
him
before
he
went
up
the
stairs
in
the
second
floor
corridor
brett
felt
his
way
along
in
guided
by
the
dim
light
coming
through
transoms
he
tried
a
door
it
opened
he
stepped
into
a
large
bedroom
with
a
double
bed
an
easy
chair
a
chest
of
drawers
he
crossed
the
room
looked
out
across
an
alley
twenty
feet
away
white
curtains
hung
at
windows
in
a
brick
wall
there
was
nothing
behind
the
windows
there
were
sounds
in
the
corridor
brett
dropped
to
the
floor
behind
the
bed
all
right
you
two
a
drunken
voice
bellowed
and
may
all
your
troubles
be
little
ones
there
was
laughter
squeals
a
dry
clash
of
beads
flung
against
the
door
a
key
grated
the
door
swung
wide
lights
blazed
in
the
hall
silhouetting
the
figures
of
a
man
in
black
jacket
and
trousers
a
woman
in
a
white
bridal
dress
and
veil
flowers
in
her
hand
take
care
mel
do
anything
i
would
do
kiss
the
bride
now
the
couple
backed
into
the
room
pushed
the
door
shut
stood
against
it
brett
crouched
behind
the
bed
not
breathing
waiting
the
couple
stood
at
the
door
in
the
dark
heads
down
brett
stood
rounded
the
foot
of
the
bed
approached
the
two
unmoving
figures
the
girl
looked
young
sleek
with
soft
dark
hair
her
eyes
were
brett
caught
a
glint
of
light
reflected
from
the
eyeball
the
man
was
bronzed
his
hair
wavy
and
blond
his
lips
were
parted
showing
even
white
teeth
the
two
stood
not
breathing
sightless
eyes
fixed
on
nothing
brett
took
the
bouquet
from
the
woman
hand
the
flowers
seemed
real
except
that
they
had
no
perfume
he
dropped
them
on
the
floor
pulled
at
the
male
golem
to
clear
the
door
the
figure
pivoted
toppled
hit
with
a
heavy
thump
brett
raised
the
woman
in
his
arms
and
propped
her
against
the
bed
back
at
the
door
he
listened
all
was
quiet
now
he
started
to
open
the
door
then
hesitated
he
went
back
to
the
bed
undid
the
tiny
pearl
buttons
down
the
front
of
the
bridal
gown
pulled
it
open
the
breasts
were
rounded
smooth
an
unbroken
creamy
white
in
the
hall
he
started
toward
the
stair
a
tall
gel
rippled
into
view
ahead
its
shape
flowing
and
wavering
now
billowing
out
then
rising
up
the
shifting
form
undulated
toward
brett
he
made
a
move
to
run
then
remembered
dhuva
stood
motionless
the
gel
wobbled
past
him
slumped
suddenly
flowed
under
a
door
brett
let
out
a
breath
never
mind
the
fat
man
there
were
too
many
gels
here
he
started
back
along
the
corridor
soft
music
came
from
double
doors
which
stood
open
on
a
landing
brett
went
to
them
risked
a
look
inside
graceful
couples
moved
sedately
on
a
polished
floor
diners
sat
at
tables
waiters
moving
among
them
at
the
far
side
of
the
room
near
a
dusty
rubber
plant
sat
the
fat
man
studying
a
menu
as
brett
watched
he
shook
out
a
napkin
ran
it
around
inside
his
collar
then
mopped
his
face
never
disturb
a
scene
dhuva
had
said
but
perhaps
he
could
blend
with
it
brett
brushed
at
his
suit
straightened
his
tie
stepped
into
the
room
a
waiter
approached
eyed
him
dubiously
brett
got
out
his
wallet
took
out
a
bill
a
quiet
table
in
the
corner
he
said
he
glanced
back
there
were
no
gels
in
sight
he
followed
the
waiter
to
a
table
near
the
fat
man
seated
he
looked
around
he
wanted
to
talk
to
the
fat
man
but
he
could
afford
to
attract
attention
he
would
watch
and
wait
his
chance
at
the
nearby
tables
men
with
suits
clean
collars
and
carefully
shaved
faces
murmured
to
sleekly
gowned
women
who
fingered
wine
glasses
smiled
archly
he
caught
fragments
of
conversation
my
dear
have
you
heard
in
the
low
eighties
quite
impossible
one
must
for
this
time
of
year
the
waiter
returned
with
a
shallow
bowl
of
milky
soup
brett
looked
at
the
array
of
spoons
forks
knives
glanced
sideways
at
the
diners
at
the
next
table
it
was
important
to
follow
the
correct
ritual
he
put
his
napkin
in
his
lap
careful
to
shake
out
all
the
folds
he
looked
at
the
spoons
again
picked
a
large
one
glanced
at
the
waiter
so
far
so
good
wine
sir
brett
indicated
the
neighboring
couple
the
same
as
they
having
the
waiter
turned
away
returned
holding
a
wine
bottle
label
toward
brett
he
looked
at
it
nodded
the
waiter
busied
himself
with
the
cork
removing
it
with
many
flourishes
setting
a
glass
before
brett
pouring
half
an
inch
of
wine
he
waited
expectantly
brett
picked
up
the
glass
tasted
it
it
tasted
like
wine
he
nodded
the
waiter
poured
brett
wondered
what
would
have
happened
if
he
had
made
a
face
and
spurned
it
but
it
would
be
too
risky
to
try
no
one
ever
did
it
couples
danced
resumed
their
seats
others
rose
and
took
the
floor
a
string
ensemble
in
a
distant
corner
played
restrained
tunes
that
seemed
to
speak
of
the
gentle
faded
melancholy
of
decorous
tea
dances
on
afternoons
brett
glanced
toward
the
fat
man
he
was
eating
soup
noisily
his
napkin
tied
under
his
chin
the
waiter
was
back
with
a
plate
lovely
day
sir
he
said
great
brett
agreed
the
waiter
placed
a
covered
platter
on
the
table
removed
the
cover
stood
with
carving
knife
and
fork
poised
a
bit
of
the
crispy
sir
brett
nodded
he
eyed
the
waiter
surreptitiously
he
looked
real
some
golems
seemed
realer
than
others
or
perhaps
it
merely
depended
on
the
parts
they
were
playing
the
man
who
had
fallen
at
the
parade
had
been
only
a
sort
of
extra
a
crowd
member
the
waiter
on
the
other
hand
was
able
to
converse
perhaps
it
would
be
possible
to
learn
something
from
him
what
uh
how
do
you
spell
the
name
of
this
town
brett
asked
i
was
never
much
of
a
one
for
spelling
sir
the
waiter
said
try
it
gravy
sir
sure
try
to
spell
the
name
perhaps
i
better
call
the
headwaiter
sir
the
golem
said
stiffly
from
the
corner
of
an
eye
brett
caught
a
flicker
of
motion
he
whirled
saw
nothing
had
it
been
a
gel
never
mind
he
said
the
waiter
served
potatoes
peas
refilled
the
wine
glass
moved
off
silently
the
question
had
been
a
little
too
unorthodox
brett
decided
perhaps
if
he
led
up
to
the
subject
more
obliquely
when
the
waiter
returned
brett
said
nice
day
very
nice
sir
better
than
yesterday
yes
indeed
sir
i
wonder
what
tomorrow
be
like
perhaps
we
have
a
bit
of
rain
sir
brett
nodded
toward
the
dance
floor
nice
orchestra
they
very
popular
sir
from
here
in
town
i
would
know
as
to
that
sir
lived
here
long
yourself
oh
yes
sir
the
waiter
expression
showed
disapproval
would
there
be
anything
else
sir
i
a
newcomer
here
brett
said
i
wonder
if
you
could
tell
me
excuse
me
sir
the
waiter
was
gone
brett
poked
at
the
mashed
potatoes
quizzing
golems
was
hopeless
he
would
have
to
find
out
for
himself
he
turned
to
look
at
the
fat
man
as
brett
watched
he
took
a
large
handkerchief
from
a
pocket
blew
his
nose
loudly
no
one
turned
to
look
the
orchestra
played
softly
the
couples
danced
now
was
as
good
a
time
as
any
brett
rose
crossed
to
the
other
table
the
man
looked
up
mind
if
i
sit
down
brett
said
i
like
to
talk
to
you
the
fat
man
blinked
motioned
to
a
chair
brett
sat
down
leaned
across
the
table
maybe
i
wrong
he
said
quietly
but
i
think
real
the
fat
man
blinked
again
what
that
he
snapped
he
had
a
high
petulant
voice
you
not
like
the
rest
of
them
i
think
i
can
talk
to
you
i
think
you
another
outsider
the
fat
man
looked
down
at
his
rumpled
suit
i
ah
was
caught
a
little
short
today
did
have
time
to
change
i
a
busy
man
and
what
business
is
it
of
yours
he
clamped
his
jaw
shut
eyed
brett
warily
i
a
stranger
here
brett
said
i
want
to
find
out
what
going
on
in
this
place
buy
an
amusement
guide
lists
all
the
shows
i
do

place
and
the
gels

i
do
just
ask
the
waiter
he
bring
you
your
jello
any
flavor
you
like
now
if
you
excuse
me
i
talking
about
the
brown
things
they
look
like
muddy
water
they
come
around
if
you
interfere
with
a
scene
the
fat
man
looked
nervous
please
go
away
if
i
make
a
disturbance
the
gels
will
come
is
that
what
you
afraid
of
now
now
be
calm
no
need
for
you
to
get
excited
i
wo
make
a
scene
brett
said
just
talk
to
me
how
long
have
you
been
here
i
dislike
scenes
i
dislike
them
intensely
when
did
you
come
here
just
ten
minutes
ago
i
just
sat
down
i
have
had
my
dinner
yet
please
young
man
go
back
to
your
table
the
fat
man
watched
brett
warily
sweat
glistened
on
his
bald
head
i
mean
this
town
how
long
have
you
been
here
where
did
you
come
from
why
i
was
born
here
where

i

from
what
sort
of
question

that

consider
that
the
stork

me
you
were
born
here
certainly
what
the
name
of
the
town

you
trying
to
make
a
fool
of

the
fat
man
was
getting
angry
his
voice
was
rising
shhh
brett
cautioned

attract
the

the

man
went
toward
the
door
brett
followed
at
the
cashier
desk
brett
turned
suddenly
saw
a
fluid
brown
shape
flicker
look
he
pulled
at
the
fat
man
arm
look
at
what
the
gel
was
gone
it
was
there
a
gel
the
fat
man
flung
down
a
bill
hurried

fumbled

ten
waited
for

called
he
heard
the
fat
man
feet
receding
down
the
stairs

he
said
to
the
cashier
the
woman
sat
staring
at
nothing
the
music
died
the
lights
flickered
went
off
in
the
gloom
brett
saw
a
fluid
shape
rise
up
he
ran
pounding
down
the
stairs
the
fat
man
was
just
rounding
the
corner
brett
opened
his
mouth
to
call
and
went
rigid
as
a
translucent
shape
of
mud
shot
from
the
door
rose
up
to
tower
before
him
brett
stood
mouth
half
open
eyes
staring
leaning
forward
with
hands
outflung
the
gel
loomed
its
surface
flickering
waiting
brett
caught
an
acrid
odor
of
geraniums
a
minute
passed
brett
cheek
itched
he
fought
a
desire
to
blink
to
swallow
to
turn
and
run
the
high
sun
beat
down
on
the
silent
street
the
still
window
displays
then
the
gel
broke
form
slumped
flashed
away
brett
tottered
back
against
the
wall
let
his
breath
out
in
a
harsh
sigh
across
the
street
he
saw
a
window
with
a
display
of
camping
equipment
portable
stoves
boots
rifles
he
crossed
the
street
tried
the
door
it
was
locked
he
looked
up
and
down
the
street
there
was
no
one
in
sight
he
kicked
in
the
glass
beside
the
latch
reached
through
and
turned
the
knob
inside
he
looked
over
the
shelves
selected
a
heavy
coil
of
nylon
rope
a
sheath
knife
a
canteen
he
examined
a
winchester
repeating
rifle
with
a
telescopic
sight
then
put
it
back
and
strapped
on
a
revolver
he
emptied
two
boxes
of
long
rifle
cartridges
into
his
pocket
then
loaded
the
pistol
he
coiled
the
rope
over
his
shoulder
and
went
back
out
into
the
empty
street
the
fat
man
was
standing
in
front
of
a
shop
in
the
next
block
picking
at
a
blemish
on
his
chin
and
eyeing
the
window
display
he
looked
up
with
a
frown
started
away
as
brett
came
up
wait
a
minute
brett
called
did
you
see
the
gel
the
one
that
cornered
me
back
there
the
fat
man
looked
back
suspiciously
kept
going

his
arm

the
fat
man
pulled
away
his
face
flushed
an
even
deeper
red
warning

from
me
brett
stepped
close
rammed
the
fat
man
hard
in
the
ribs
he
sank
to
his
knees
gasping
the
panama
hat
rolled
away

gasped

waved

arm

empty
before

thick
brett

the
fat

his
face
was
pale
and
moist

to
try
to

pit

brett
dropped
his
hands
from
the
fat
man
arms
stood
looking
at
him
the
blotched
face
pale
now
the
damp
forehead
the
quivering
jowls
the
fat
man
stooped
for
his
hat
slapped
it
against
his
leg
clamped
it
on
his
head
i
think
i
understand
now
said
brett
this
is
your
place
this
imitation
city
everything
faked
to
fit
your
needs
like
in
the
hotel
wherever
you
go
the
scene
unrolls
in
front
of
you
you
never
see
the
gels
never
discover
the
secret
of
the
golems
because
you
conform
you
never
do
the
unexpected
that
right
i
i
respectable
i
do
pry
i
nose
into
other
people
business
why
should
i
just
let
me
alone
sure
brett
said
even
if
i
dragged
you
down
there
and
showed
you
you
would
believe
it
but
you
not
in
the
scene
now
i
taken
you
out
of
it
suddenly
the
fat
man
turned
and
ran
a
few
yards
then
looked
back
to
see
whether
brett
was
pursuing
him
he
shook
a
round
fist
i
seen
your
kind
before
he
shouted
troublemakers
brett
took
a
step
toward
him
the
fat
man
yelped
and
ran
another
fifty
feet
his
coat
tails
bobbing
he
looked
back
stopped
a
fat
figure
alone
in
the
empty
sunny
street
you
have
seen
the
last
of
me
he
shouted
we
know
how
to
deal
with
your
kind
he
tugged
at
his
vest
went
off
along
the
sidewalk
brett
watched
him
go
then
started
back
toward
the
hollow
building
the
jagged
fragments
of
masonry
brett
had
knocked
from
the
wall
lay
as
he
had
left
them
he
stepped
through
the
opening
peered
down
into
the
murky
pit
trying
to
judge
its
depth
a
hundred
feet
at
least
perhaps
a
hundred
and
fifty
he
unslung
the
rope
from
his
shoulder
tied
one
end
to
the
brass
stump
threw
the
coil
down
the
precipitous
side
it
fell
away
into
darkness
hung
swaying
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
the
end
reached
any
solid
footing
below
he
could
waste
any
more
time
looking
for
help
he
would
have
to
try
it
alone
there
was
a
scrape
of
shoe
leather
on
the
pavement
outside
he
turned
stepped
out
into
the
white
sunlight
the
fat
man
rounded
the
corner
recoiled
as
he
saw
brett
he
flung
out
a
pudgy
forefinger
his
protruding
eyes
wide
in
his
blotchy
red
face
there
he
is
i
told
you
he
came
this
way
two
uniformed
policemen
came
into
view
one
eyed
the
gun
at
brett
side
put
a
hand
on
his
own
better
take
that
off
sir
look
brett
said
to
the
fat
man
he
stooped
picked
up
a
crust
of
masonry
look
at
this
just
a
shell
he
blasted
a
hole
right
in
that
building
officer
the
fat
man
shrilled
he
dangerous
the
cop
ignored
the
gaping
hole
in
the
wall
you
have
to
come
along
with
me
sir
this
gentleman
registered
a
complaint
brett
stood
staring
into
the
cop
eyes
they
were
pale
blue
eyes
looking
steadily
back
at
him
from
a
bland
face
could
the
cop
be
real
or
would
he
be
able
to
push
him
over
as
he
had
other
golems
the
fellow
not
right
in
the
head
the
fat
man
was
saying
to
the
cop
you
should
have
heard
his
crazy
talk
a
troublemaker
his
kind
have
got
to
be
locked
up
the
cop
nodded
ca
have
anyone
causing
trouble
only
a
young
fellow
said
the
fat
man
he
mopped
at
his
forehead
with
a
large
handkerchief
tragic
but
i
sure
that
you
men
know
how
to
handle
him
better
give
me
the
gun
sir
the
cop
held
out
a
hand
brett
moved
suddenly
rammed
stiff
fingers
into
the
cop
ribs
he
stiffened
toppled
lay
rigid
staring
up
at
nothing
you
you
killed
him
the
fat
man
gasped
backing
the
second
cop
tugged
at
his
gun
brett
leaped
at
him
sent
him
down
with
a
blow
to
the
ribs
he
turned
to
face
the
fat
man
i
did
kill
them
i
just
turned
them
off
they
not
real
just
golems
a
killer
and
right
in
the
city
in
broad
daylight
you
got
to
help
me
brett
cried
this
whole
scene
do
you
see
it
has
the
air
of
something
improvised
in
a
hurry
to
deal
with
the
unexpected
factor
that
me
the
gels
know
something
wrong
but
they
ca
quite
figure
out
what
when
you
called
the
cops
the
gels
obliged
startlingly
the
fat
man
burst
into
tears
he
fell
to
his
knees
do
kill
me
oh
do
kill
me
nobody
going
to
kill
you
you
fool
brett
snapped
look
i
want
to
show
you
he
seized
the
fat
man
lapel
dragged
him
to
his
feet
and
across
the
sidewalk
through
the
opening
the
fat
man
stopped
dead
stumbled
back
what
this
what
kind
of
place
is
this
he
scrambled
for
the
opening
it
what
i
been
trying
to
tell
you
this
city
you
live
in
it
a
hollow
shell
there
nothing
inside
none
of
it
real
only
you
and
me
there
was
another
man
dhuva
i
was
in
a
cafe
with
him
a
gel
came
he
tried
to
run
it
caught
him
now
he
down
there
i
not

the
fat
man
babbled
i
have
my
friends
my
clubs
my
business
associates
i
insured
lately
i
been
thinking
a
lot
about
jesus
he
broke
off
whirled
and
jumped
for
the
doorway
brett
leaped
after
him
caught
his
coat
it
ripped
the
fat
man
stumbled
over
one
of
the
went
to
hands
and
knees
brett
stood
over
him
get
up
damn
it
he
snapped
i
need
help
and
you
going
to
help
me
he
hauled
the
fat
man
to
his
feet
all
you
have
to
do
is
stand
by
the
rope
dhuva
may
be
unconscious
when
i
find
him
you
have
to
help
me
haul
him
up
if
anybody
comes
along

gels
i
mean
give
me
a
signal
a
whistle
like
this
brett
demonstrated
and
if
i
get
in
trouble
do
what
you
can
here
brett
started
to
offer
the
fat
man
the
gun
then
handed
him
the
hunting
knife
if
anybody
interferes
this
may
not
do
any
good
but
it
something
i
going
down
now
the
fat
man
watched
as
brett
gripped
the
rope
let
himself
over
the
edge
brett
looked
up
at
the
glistening
face
the
damp
strands
of
hair
across
the
freckled
scalp
brett
had
no
assurance
that
the
man
would
stay
at
his
post
but
he
had
done
what
he
could
remember
said
brett
it
a
real
man
they
got
like
you
and
me
not
a
golem
we
owe
it
to
him
the
fat
man
hands
trembled
he
watched
brett
licked
his
lips
brett
started
down
the
descent
was
easy
the
rough
face
of
the
excavation
gave
footholds
the
end
of
a
decaying
timber
projected
below
it
was
the
stump
of
a
crumbling
concrete
pipe
two
feet
in
diameter
brett
was
ten
feet
below
the
rim
of
floor
now
above
the
broad
figure
of
the
fat
man
was
visible
in
silhouette
against
the
jagged
opening
in
the
wall
now
the
cliff
shelved
back
the
rope
hung
free
brett
eased
past
the
cut
end
of
a
rusted
water
pipe
went
down
hand
over
hand
if
there
were
nothing
at
the
bottom
to
give
him
footing
it
would
be
a
long
climb
back
twenty
feet
below
he
could
see
the
still
black
water
pockmarked
with
expanding
rings
where
bits
of
debris
dislodged
by
his
passage
peppered
the
surface
there
was
a
rhythmic
vibration
in
the
rope
brett
felt
it
through
his
hands
a
fine
sawing
sensation
he
was
falling
gripping
the
limp
rope
he
slammed
on
his
back
in
three
feet
of
oily
water
the
coils
of
rope
collapsed
around
him
with
a
sustained
splashing
he
got
to
his
feet
groped
for
the
end
of
the
rope
the
glossy
nylon
strands
had
been
cleanly
cut
for
half
an
hour
brett
waded
in
water
along
a
wall
of
damp
clay
that
rose
sheer
above
him
far
above
bars
of
dim
sunlight
crossed
the
upper
reaches
of
the
cavern
he
had
seen
no
sign
of
dhuva
or
the
gels
he
encountered
a
sodden
timber
that
projected
above
the
surface
of
the
pool
clung
to
it
to
rest
bits
of
flotsam
a
plastic
pistol
bridge
tallies
a
golf
bag
floated
in
the
black
water
a
tunnel
extended
through
the
clay
wall
ahead
beyond
brett
could
see
a
second
great
cavern
rising
he
pictured
the
city
silent
and
empty
above
and
the
earth
beneath
he
moved
on
an
hour
later
brett
had
traversed
the
second
cavern
now
he
clung
to
an
outthrust
spur
of
granite
directly
beneath
the
point
at
which
dhuva
had
disappeared
far
above
he
could
see
the
waitress
standing
stiffly
on
her
ledge
he
was
tired
walking
in
water
his
feet
floundering
in
soft
mud
was
exhausting
he
was
no
closer
to
escape
or
to
finding
dhuva
than
he
had
been
when
the
fat
man
cut
the
rope
he
had
been
a
fool
to
leave
the
man
alone
with
a
knife
but
he
had
had
no
choice
he
would
have
to
find
another
way
out
endlessly
wading
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit
was
useless
he
would
have
to
climb
one
spot
was
as
good
as
another
he
stepped
back
and
scanned
the
wall
of
clay
looming
over
him
twenty
feet
up
water
dripped
from
the
broken
end
of
a
water
main
brett
uncoiled
the
rope
from
his
shoulder
tied
a
loop
in
the
end
whirled
it
and
cast
upward
it
missed
fell
back
with
a
splash
he
gathered
it
in
tried
again
on
the
third
try
it
caught
he
tested
it
then
started
up
his
hands
were
slippery
with
mud
and
water
he
twined
the
rope
around
his
legs
inched
higher
the
slender
cable
was
smooth
as
glass
he
slipped
back
two
feet
then
inched
upward
slipped
again
painfully
climbed
slipped
climbed
after
the
first
ten
feet
he
found
in
the
muddy
wall
he
worked
his
way
up
his
hands
aching
and
raw
a
projecting
tangle
of
power
cable
gave
a
secure
purchase
for
a
foot
he
rested
nearby
an
opening
two
feet
in
diameter
gaped
in
the
clay
a
tunnel
it
might
be
possible
to
swing
sideways
across
the
face
of
the
clay
and
reach
the
opening
it
was
worth
a
try
his
stiff
hands
would
pull
him
no
higher
he
gripped
the
rope
kicked
off
sideways
hooked
a
foot
in
the
tunnel
mouth
half
jumped
half
fell
into
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
he
clung
to
the
rope
shook
it
loose
from
the
pipe
above
coiled
it
and
looped
it
over
his
shoulder
on
hands
and
knees
he
started
into
the
narrow
passage
the
tunnel
curved
left
then
right
dipped
then
angled
up
brett
crawled
steadily
the
smooth
stiff
clay
yielding
and
cold
against
his
hands
and
sodden
knees
another
smaller
tunnel
joined
from
the
left
another
angled
in
from
above
the
tunnel
widened
to
three
feet
then
four
brett
got
to
his
feet
walked
in
a
crouch
here
and
there
barely
visible
in
the
objects
lay
imbedded
in
the
mud
a
spoon
its
handle
bent
the
rusted
engine
of
an
electric
train
a
portable
radio
green
with
corrosion
from
burst
batteries
at
a
distance
brett
estimated
of
a
hundred
yards
from
the
pit
the
tunnel
opened
into
a
vast
cave
from
tiny
discs
of
frosted
glass
set
in
the
ceiling
far
above
a
row
of
discolored
concrete
piles
the
foundations
of
the
building
above
protruded
against
the
near
wall
their
surfaces
nibbled
and
pitted
between
brett
and
the
concrete
columns
the
floor
was
littered
with
pale
sticks
and
stones
gleaming
dully
in
the
gloom
brett
started
across
the
floor
one
of
the
sticks
snapped
underfoot
he
kicked
a
stone
it
rolled
lightly
came
to
rest
with
hollow
eyes
staring
toward
him
a
human
skull
the
floor
of
the
cave
covered
an
area
the
size
of
a
city
block
it
was
blanketed
with
human
bones
with
here
and
there
a
small
cat
skeleton
or
the
fanged
of
a
dog
there
was
a
constant
rustling
of
rats
that
played
among
the
rib
cages
sat
atop
crania
scuttled
behind
brett
picked
his
way
stepping
over
imitation
pearl
necklaces
zircon
rings
plastic
buttons
hearing
aids
lipsticks
compacts
corset
stays
prosthetic
devices
rubber
heels
wrist
watches
lapel
watches
pocket
watches
with
corroded
brass
chains
ahead
brett
saw
a
patch
of
color
a
blur
of
pale
yellow
he
hurried
stumbling
over
bone
heaps
crunching
eyeglasses
underfoot
he
reached
the
still
figure
where
it
lay
slackly
face
down
gingerly
he
squatted
turned
it
on
its
back
it
was
dhuva
brett
slapped
the
cold
wrists
rubbed
the
clammy
hands
dhuva
stirred
moaned
weakly
brett
pulled
him
to
a
sitting
position
wake
up
he
whispered
wake
up
dhuva
eyelids
fluttered
he
blinked
dully
at
brett
the
gels
may
turn
up
any
minute
brett
hissed
we
have
to
get
away
from
here
can
you
walk
i
saw
it
said
dhuva
faintly
but
it
moved
so
fast
you
safe
here
for
the
moment
brett
said
there
are
none
of
them
around
but
they
may
be
back
we
got
to
find
a
way
out
dhuva
started
up
staring
around
where
am
i
he
said
hoarsely
brett
seized
his
arm
steadied
him
on
his
feet
we
in
a
cave
he
said
the
whole
city
is
undermined
with
them
they
connected
by
tunnels
we
have
to
find
one
leading
back
to
the
surface
dhuva
gazed
around
at
the
acres
of
bones
it
left
me
here
for
dead
or
to
die
said
brett
look
at
them
dhuva
breathed
hundreds
thousands
the
whole
population
it
looks
like
the
gels
must
have
whisked
them
down
here
one
by
one
but
why
for
interfering
with
the
scenes
but
that
does
matter
now
what
matters
is
getting
out
come
on
i
see
tunnels
on
the
other
side
they
crossed
the
broad
floor
around
them
the
white
bones
the
rustle
of
rats
they
reached
the
far
side
of
the
cave
picked
a
tunnel
which
trended
upward
a
trickle
of
water
seeping
out
of
the
dark
mouth
they
started
up
the
slope
we
have
to
have
a
weapon
against
the
gels
said
brett
why
i
do
want
to
fight
them
dhuva
voice
was
thin
frightened
i
want
to
get
away
from
here
even
back
to
wavly
i
rather
face
the
duke
this
was
a
real
town
once
said
brett
the
gels
have
taken
it
over
hollowed
out
the
buildings
mined
the
earth
under
it
killed
off
the
people
and
put
imitation
people
in
their
place
and
nobody
ever
knew
i
met
a
man
who
lived
here
all
his
life
he
does
know
but
we
know
and
we
have
to
do
something
about
it
it
not
our
business
i
had
enough
i
want
to
get
away
the
gels
must
stay
down
below
somewhere
in
that
maze
of
tunnels
for
some
reason
they
try
to
keep
up
appearances
but
only
for
the
people
who
belong
here
they
play
out
scenes
for
the
fat
man
wherever
he
goes
and
he
never
goes
anywhere
he
is
expected
to
we
get
over
the
wall
somehow
said
dhuva
we
may
starve
crossing
the
dry
fields
but
that
better
than
this
they
emerged
from
the
tunnel
into
a
coal
bin
crossed
to
a
sagging
door
found
themselves
in
a
boiler
room
stairs
led
up
to
sunlight
in
the
street
in
the
shadow
of
tall
buildings
a
boxy
sedan
was
parked
at
the
curb
brett
went
to
it
tried
the
door
it
opened
keys
dangled
from
the
ignition
switch
he
slid
into
the
dusty
seat
behind
him
there
was
a
hoarse
scream
brett
looked
up
through
the
streaked
windshield
he
saw
a
mighty
gel
rear
up
before
dhuva
who
crouched
back
against
the
blackened
brick
front
of
the
building
do
move
dhuva
brett
shouted
dhuva
stood
frozen
flattened
against
the
wall
the
gel
towered
its
surface
rippling
brett
eased
from
the
seat
he
stood
on
the
pavement
fifteen
feet
from
the
gel
the
rank
gel
odor
came
in
waves
from
the
creature
beyond
it
he
could
see
dhuva
white
terrified
face
illustration
silently
brett
turned
the
latch
of
the
auto
hood
raised
it
the
copper
fuel
line
curved
down
from
the
firewall
to
a
glass
sediment
cup
the
knurled
retaining
screw
turned
easily
the
cup
dropped
into
brett
hand
gasoline
ran
down
in
an
amber
stream
brett
pulled
off
his
damp
coat
wadded
it
jammed
it
under
the
flow
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
dhuva
still
rigid
and
the
gel
hovering
uncertain
the
coat
was
saturated
with
gasoline
now
brett
fumbled
a
match
box
from
his
pocket
wet
he
threw
the
sodden
container
aside
the
battery
caught
his
eye
clamped
in
a
rusted
frame
under
the
hood
he
jerked
the
pistol
from
its
holster
used
it
to
short
the
terminals
tiny
blue
sparks
jumped
he
jammed
the
coat
near
rasped
the
gun
against
the
soft
lead
poles
with
a
whoosh
the
coat
caught
yellow
flames
leaped
brett
snatched
at
a
sleeve
whirled
the
coat
high
the
great
gel
attracted
by
the
sudden
motion
rushed
at
him
he
flung
the
blazing
garment
over
the
monster
leaped
aside
the
creature
went
mad
it
slumped
lashed
itself
against
the
pavement
the
burning
coat
was
thrown
clear
the
gel
threw
itself
across
the
pavement
into
the
gutter
sending
a
splatter
of
filthy
water
over
brett
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
brett
saw
dhuva
seize
the
burning
coat
hurl
it
into
the
pooled
gasoline
in
the
gutter
fire
leaped
twenty
feet
high
in
its
center
the
great
gel
bucked
and
writhed
the
ancient
car
shuddered
as
the
frantic
monster
struck
it
black
smoke
boiled
up
an
unbelievable
stench
came
to
brett
nostrils
he
backed
coughing
flames
roared
around
the
front
of
the
car
paint
blistered
and
burned
a
tire
burst
in
a
final
frenzy
the
gel
whipped
clear
lay
a
great
blackened
shape
of
melting
rubber
twitching
then
still
they
tunneled
under
everything
brett
said
they
cut
through
power
lines
and
water
lines
concrete
steel
earth
they
left
the
shell
shored
up
with
trusswork
somehow
they
kept
water
and
power
flowing
to
wherever
they
needed
it
i
do
care
about
your
theories
dhuva
said
i
only
want
to
get
away
it
bound
to
work
dhuva
i
need
your
help
no
then
i
have
to
try
alone
he
turned
away
wait
dhuva
called
he
came
up
to
brett
i
owe
you
a
life
you
saved
mine
i
ca
let
you
down
now
but
if
this
does
work
or
if
you
ca
find
what
you
want
then
we
go
together
they
turned
down
a
side
street
walking
rapidly
at
the
next
corner
brett
pointed
there
one
they
crossed
to
the
service
station
at
a
run
brett
tried
the
door
locked
he
kicked
at
it
splintered
the
wood
around
the
lock
he
glanced
around
inside
no
good
he
called
try
the
next
building
i
check
the
one
behind
he
crossed
the
wide
drive
battered
in
a
door
looked
in
at
a
floor
covered
with
wood
shavings
it
ended
ten
feet
from
the
door
brett
went
to
the
edge
looked
down
diagonally
forty
feet
away
the
underground
storage
tank
which
supplied
the
gasoline
pumps
of
the
station
perched
isolated
on
a
column
of
striated
clay
ribbed
with
chitinous
gel
buttresses
the
truncated
feed
lines
ended
six
feet
from
the
tank
from
brett
position
it
was
impossible
to
say
whether
the
ends
were
plugged
across
the
dark
cavern
a
square
of
light
appeared
dhuva
stood
in
a
doorway
looking
toward
brett
over
here
dhuva
brett
uncoiled
his
rope
arranged
a
he
measured
the
distance
with
his
eye
tossed
the
loop
it
slapped
the
top
of
the
tank
caught
on
a
massive
fitting
he
smashed
the
glass
from
a
window
tied
the
end
of
the
rope
to
the
center
post
dhuva
arrived
watched
as
brett
went
to
the
edge
hooked
his
legs
over
the
rope
and
started
across
to
the
tank
it
was
an
easy
crossing
brett
feet
clanged
against
the
tank
he
straddled
the
cylinder
worked
his
way
to
the
end
then
clambered
down
to
the
two
feed
lines
he
tested
their
resilience
then
lay
flat
eased
out
on
them
there
were
plugs
of
hard
waxy
material
in
the
cut
ends
of
the
pipes
brett
poked
at
them
with
the
pistol
chunks
loosened
and
fell
he
worked
for
fifteen
minutes
before
the
first
trickle
came
two
minutes
later
two
thick
streams
of
gasoline
were
pouring
down
into
the
darkness
brett
and
dhuva
piled
sticks
scraps
of
paper
shavings
and
lumps
of
coal
around
a
core
of
rags
directly
above
the
heaped
tinder
a
taut
rope
stretched
from
the
window
post
to
a
child
wagon
the
steel
bed
of
which
contained
a
second
heap
of
combustibles
the
wagon
hung
half
over
the
ragged
edge
of
the
floor
it
should
take
about
fifteen
minutes
for
the
fire
to
burn
through
the
rope
brett
said
then
the
wagon
will
fall
and
dump
the
hot
coals
in
the
gasoline
by
then
it
will
have
spread
all
over
the
surface
and
flowed
down
side
tunnels
into
other
parts
of
the
cavern
system
but
it
may
not
get
them
all
it
will
get
some
of
them
it
the
best
we
can
do
right
now
you
get
the
fire
going
in
the
wagon
i
start
this
one
up
dhuva
sniffed
the
air
that
fluid
he
said
we
know
it
in
wavly
as
phlogistoneum
the
wealthy
use
it
for
cooking
we
use
it
to
cook
gels
brett
struck
a
match
the
fire
leaped
up
smoking
dhuva
watched
struck
his
match
awkwardly
started
his
blaze
they
stood
for
a
moment
watching
the
nylon
curled
and
blackened
melting
in
the
heat
we
better
get
moving
brett
said
it
does
look
as
though
it
will
last
fifteen
minutes
they
stepped
out
into
the
street
behind
them
wisps
of
smoke
curled
from
the
door
dhuva
seized
brett
arm
look
half
a
block
away
the
fat
man
in
the
panama
hat
strode
toward
them
at
the
head
of
a
group
of
men
in
grey
flannel
that
him
the
fat
man
shouted
the
one
i
told
you
about
i
knew
the
scoundrel
would
be
back
he
slowed
eyeing
brett
and
dhuva
warily
you
better
get
away
from
here
fast
brett
called
there
be
an
explosion
in
a
few
minutes
smoke
the
fat
man
yelped
fire
they
set
fire
to
the
city
there
it
is
pouring
out
of
the
window
and
the
door
he
started
forward
brett
yanked
the
pistol
from
the
holster
thumbed
back
the
hammer
stop
right
there
he
barked
for
your
own
good
i
telling
you
to
run
i
do
care
about
that
crowd
of
golems
you
collected
but
hate
to
see
a
real
human
get
hurt
even
a
cowardly
one
like
you
these
are
honest
citizens
the
fat
man
gasped
standing
staring
at
the
gun
you
wo
get
away
with
this
we
all
know
you
you
be
dealt
with
we
going
now
and
you
going
too
you
ca
kill
us
all
the
fat
man
said
he
licked
his
lips
we
let
you
destroy
our
city
as
the
fat
man
turned
to
exhort
his
followers
brett
fired
once
twice
three
times
three
golems
fell
on
their
faces
the
fat
man
whirled
devil
he
shrieked
a
killer
is
abroad
he
charged
mouth
open
brett
ducked
aside
tripped
the
fat
man
he
fell
heavily
slamming
his
face
against
the
pavement
the
golems
surged
forward
brett
and
dhuva
slammed
punches
to
the
sternum
took
clumsy
blows
on
the
shoulder
back
chest
golems
fell
brett
ducked
a
wild
swing
toppled
his
attacker
turned
to
see
dhuva
deal
with
the
last
of
the
dummies
the
fat
man
sat
in
the
street
dabbing
at
his
bleeding
nose
the
panama
still
in
place
get
up
brett
commanded
there
no
time
left
you
killed
them
killed
them
all
the
fat
man
got
to
his
feet
then
turned
suddenly
and
plunged
for
the
door
from
which
a
cloud
of
smoke
poured
brett
hauled
him
back
he
and
dhuva
started
off
dragging
the
struggling
man
between
them
they
had
gone
a
block
when
their
prisoner
with
a
sudden
frantic
jerk
freed
himself
set
off
at
a
run
for
the
fire
let
him
go
dhuva
cried
it
too
late
to
go
back
the
fat
man
leaped
fallen
golems
wrestled
with
the
door
disappeared
into
the
smoke
brett
and
dhuva
sprinted
for
the
corner
as
they
rounded
it
a
tremendous
blast
shook
the
street
the
pavement
before
them
quivered
opened
in
a
wide
crack
a
section
dropped
from
view
they
skirted
the
gaping
hole
dashed
for
safety
as
the
facades
along
the
street
cracked
fell
in
clouds
of
dust
the
street
trembled
under
a
second
explosion
cracks
opened
dust
rising
in
puffs
from
the
long
wavering
lines
masonry
collapsed
around
them
they
put
their
heads
down
and
ran
winded
brett
and
dhuva
walked
through
the
empty
streets
of
the
city
behind
them
smoke
blackened
the
sky
embers
floated
down
around
them
the
odor
of
burning
gel
was
carried
on
the
wind
the
late
sun
shone
on
the
blank
pavement
a
lone
golem
in
a
tasseled
fez
left
over
from
the
morning
parade
leaned
stiffly
against
a
lamp
post
eyes
blank
empty
cars
sat
in
driveways
tv
antennae
stood
forlornly
against
the
sunset
that
place
looks
said
brett
indicating
an
open
apartment
window
with
a
curtain
billowing
above
a
potted
geranium
i
take
a
look
he
came
back
shaking
his
head
they
were
all
in
the
tv
room
they
looked
so
natural
at
first
i
mean
they
did
look
up
or
anything
when
i
walked
in
i
turned
the
set
off
the
electricity
is
still
working
anyway
wonder
how
long
it
will
last
they
turned
down
a
residential
street
underfoot
the
pavement
trembled
at
a
distant
blast
they
skirted
a
crack
kept
going
occasional
golems
stood
in
awkward
poses
or
lay
across
sidewalks
one
clad
in
black
tilted
awkwardly
in
a
gothic
entry
of
fretted
stone
work
i
guess
there
wo
be
any
church
this
sunday
said
brett
he
halted
before
a
brown
brick
apartment
house
an
untended
hose
welled
on
a
patch
of
sickly
lawn
brett
went
to
the
door
stood
listening
then
went
in
across
the
room
the
still
figure
of
a
woman
sat
in
a
rocker
a
curl
stirred
on
her
smooth
forehead
a
flicker
of
expression
seemed
to
cross
the
lined
face
brett
started
forward
do
be
afraid
you
can
come
with
us
he
stopped
a
flapping
cast
restless
shadows
on
the
still
golem
features
on
which
dust
was
already
settling
brett
turned
away
shaking
his
head
all
of
them
he
said
it
as
though
they
were
snipped
out
of
paper
when
the
gels
died
their
dummies
died
with
them
why
said
dhuva
what
does
it
all
mean
mean
said
brett
he
shook
his
head
started
off
again
along
the
street
it
does
mean
anything
it
just
the
way
things
are
brett
sat
in
a
deserted
cadillac
tuning
the
radio
anybody
hear
me
said
a
plaintive
voice
from
the
speaker
this
is
ab
gullorian
at
the
twin
spires
looks
like
i
the
only
one
left
alive
can
anybody
hear
me
brett
tuned
been
asking
the
wrong
questions
looking
for
the
final
fact
now
these
are
strange
matters
brothers
but
if
a
flower
blooms
what
man
shall
ask
why
what
lore
do
we
seek
in
a
symphony
he
twisted
the
knob
again
kansas
city
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
of
us
and
the
dead
piled
all
over
the
place
but
it
a
funny
thing
doc
potter
started
to
do
an
autopsy
brett
turned
the
knob
cq

cq
this
is
hollip

there
been
a
disaster
here
at
port
wanderlust
we
need
take
jesus
into
your
hearts
another
station
urged
to
base
the
radio
said
faintly
with
much
crackling
lunar
observatory
to
base
come
in
lunar
control
this
is
commander
mcvee
of
the
lunar
detachment
sole
survivor
hello
hollip
quate
hollip
quate
this
is
kansas
city
calling
say
where
did
you
say
you
were
calling
from
it
looks
as
though
both
of
us
had
a
lot
of
mistaken
ideas
about
the
world
outside
said
brett
most
of
these
stations
sound
as
though
they
might
as
well
be
coming
from
mars
i
do
understand
where
the
voices
come
from
dhuva
said
but
all
the
places
they
name
are
strange
to
me
except
the
twin
spires
i
heard
of
kansas
city
brett
said
but
none
of
the
other
ones
the
ground
trembled
a
low
rumble
rolled
another
one
brett
said
he
switched
off
the
radio
tried
the
starter
it
groaned
turned
over
the
engine
caught
sputtered
then
ran
smoothly
get
in
dhuva
we
might
as
well
ride
which
way
do
we
go
to
get
out
of
this
place
the
wall
lies
in
that
direction
said
dhuva
but
i
do
know
about
a
gate
we
worry
about
that
when
we
get
to
it
said
brett
this
whole
place
is
going
to
collapse
before
long
we
really
started
something
i
suppose
other
underground
storage
tanks
caught
and
gas
lines
too
a
building
ahead
cracked
fell
in
a
heap
of
pulverized
plaster
the
car
bucked
as
a
blast
sent
a
ripple
down
the
street
a
manhole
cover
popped
up
clattered
a
few
feet
dropped
from
sight
brett
swerved
gunned
the
car
it
leaped
over
rubble
roared
along
the
littered
pavement
brett
looked
in
the
mirror
a
block
behind
them
the
street
ended
smoke
and
dust
rose
from
the
immense
pit
we
just
missed
it
that
time
he
called
how
far
to
the
wall
not
far
turn
here
brett
rounded
the
corner
with
a
shrieking
of
tires
ahead
the
grey
wall
rose
up
blank
featureless
this
is
a
dead
end
brett
shouted
we
better
get
out
and
run
for
it
no
time
i
going
to
ram
the
wall
maybe
i
can
knock
a
hole
in
it
dhuva
crouched
teeth
gritted
brett
held
the
accelerator
to
the
floor
roared
straight
toward
the
wall
the
heavy
car
shot
across
the
last
few
yards
struck
and
burst
through
a
curtain
of
canvas
into
a
field
of
dry
stalks
brett
steered
the
car
in
a
wide
curve
to
halt
and
look
back
a
blackened
panama
hat
floated
down
settled
among
the
stalks
smoke
poured
up
in
a
dense
cloud
from
behind
the
canvas
wall
a
fetid
stench
pervaded
the
air
that
finishes
that
i
guess
brett
said
i
do
know
look
there
brett
turned
far
across
the
dry
field
columns
of
smoke
rose
from
the
ground
the
whole
thing
undermined
brett
said
how
far
does
it
go
no
telling
but
we
better
be
off
perhaps
we
can
get
beyond
the
edge
of
it
not
that
it
matters
we
all
that
left
you
sound
like
the
fat
man
brett
said
but
why
should
we
be
so
surprised
to
find
out
the
truth
after
all
we
never
saw
it
before
all
we
knew
or
thought
we
knew
was
what
they
told
us
the
moon
the
other
side
of
the
world
a
distant
city
or
even
the
next
town
how
do
we
really
know
what
there
unless
we
go
and
see
for
ourselves
does
a
goldfish
in
his
bowl
know
what
the
ocean
is
like
where
did
they
come
from
those
gels
how
much
of
the
world
have
they
undermined
what
about
wavly
is
it
a
golem
country
too
the
duke
and
all
the
people
i
knew
i
do
know
dhuva
i
been
wondering
about
the
people
in
casperton
like
doc
welch
i
used
to
see
him
in
the
street
with
his
little
black
bag
i
always
thought
it
was
full
of
pills
and
scalpels
but
maybe
it
really
had
zebra
tails
and
toad
eyes
in
it
maybe
he
really
a
magician
on
his
way
to
cast
spells
against
demons
maybe
the
people
i
used
to
see
hurrying
to
catch
the
bus
every
morning
were
really
going
to
the
office
maybe
they
go
down
into
caves
and
chip
away
at
the
foundations
of
things
maybe
they
go
up
on
rooftops
and
put
on
robes
and
fly
away
i
used
to
pass
by
a
bank
in
casperton
a
big
grey
stone
building
with
little
curtains
over
the
bottom
half
of
the
windows
i
never
go
in
there
i
do
have
anything
to
do
in
a
bank
i
always
thought
it
was
full
of
bankers
banking
now
i
do
know
it
could
be
anything
that
why
i
afraid
dhuva
said
it
could
be
anything
things
are
really
any
different
than
they
were
said
brett
except
that
now
we
know
he
turned
the
big
car
out
across
the
field
toward
casperton
i
do
know
what
we
find
when
we
get
back
aunt
haicey
but
there
only
one
way
to
find
out
the
moon
rose
as
the
car
bumped
westward
raising
a
trail
of
dust
against
the
luminous
sky
of
evening
the
end
illustration
the
body
shifted
rotating
stiffly
then
tilted
upright
the
sun
struck
through
the
amber
shape
that
flowed
down
to
form
itself
into
the
crested
wave
see
it
could
be
anything
