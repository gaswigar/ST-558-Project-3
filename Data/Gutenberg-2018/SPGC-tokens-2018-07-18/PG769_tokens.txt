the
book
of
tea
by
kakuzo
okakura
i
the
cup
of
humanity
tea
began
as
a
medicine
and
grew
into
a
beverage
in
china
in
the
eighth
century
it
entered
the
realm
of
poetry
as
one
of
the
polite
amusements
the
fifteenth
century
saw
japan
ennoble
it
into
a
religion
of
aestheticism
teaism
teaism
is
a
cult
founded
on
the
adoration
of
the
beautiful
among
the
sordid
facts
of
everyday
existence
it
inculcates
purity
and
harmony
the
mystery
of
mutual
charity
the
romanticism
of
the
social
order
it
is
essentially
a
worship
of
the
imperfect
as
it
is
a
tender
attempt
to
accomplish
something
possible
in
this
impossible
thing
we
know
as
life
the
philosophy
of
tea
is
not
mere
aestheticism
in
the
ordinary
acceptance
of
the
term
for
it
expresses
conjointly
with
ethics
and
religion
our
whole
point
of
view
about
man
and
nature
it
is
hygiene
for
it
enforces
cleanliness
it
is
economics
for
it
shows
comfort
in
simplicity
rather
than
in
the
complex
and
costly
it
is
moral
geometry
inasmuch
as
it
defines
our
sense
of
proportion
to
the
universe
it
represents
the
true
spirit
of
eastern
democracy
by
making
all
its
votaries
aristocrats
in
taste
the
long
isolation
of
japan
from
the
rest
of
the
world
so
conducive
to
introspection
has
been
highly
favourable
to
the
development
of
teaism
our
home
and
habits
costume
and
cuisine
porcelain
lacquer
painting
our
very
literature
all
have
been
subject
to
its
influence
no
student
of
japanese
culture
could
ever
ignore
its
presence
it
has
permeated
the
elegance
of
noble
boudoirs
and
entered
the
abode
of
the
humble
our
peasants
have
learned
to
arrange
flowers
our
meanest
labourer
to
offer
his
salutation
to
the
rocks
and
waters
in
our
common
parlance
we
speak
of
the
man
with
no
tea
in
him
when
he
is
insusceptible
to
the
interests
of
the
personal
drama
again
we
stigmatise
the
untamed
aesthete
who
regardless
of
the
mundane
tragedy
runs
riot
in
the
springtide
of
emancipated
emotions
as
one
with
too
much
tea
in
him
the
outsider
may
indeed
wonder
at
this
seeming
much
ado
about
nothing
what
a
tempest
in
a
he
will
say
but
when
we
consider
how
small
after
all
the
cup
of
human
enjoyment
is
how
soon
overflowed
with
tears
how
easily
drained
to
the
dregs
in
our
quenchless
thirst
for
infinity
we
shall
not
blame
ourselves
for
making
so
much
of
the
mankind
has
done
worse
in
the
worship
of
bacchus
we
have
sacrificed
too
freely
and
we
have
even
transfigured
the
gory
image
of
mars
why
not
consecrate
ourselves
to
the
queen
of
the
camelias
and
revel
in
the
warm
stream
of
sympathy
that
flows
from
her
altar
in
the
liquid
amber
within
the
the
initiated
may
touch
the
sweet
reticence
of
confucius
the
piquancy
of
laotse
and
the
ethereal
aroma
of
sakyamuni
himself
those
who
can
not
feel
the
littleness
of
great
things
in
themselves
are
apt
to
overlook
the
greatness
of
little
things
in
others
the
average
westerner
in
his
sleek
complacency
will
see
in
the
tea
ceremony
but
another
instance
of
the
thousand
and
one
oddities
which
constitute
the
quaintness
and
childishness
of
the
east
to
him
he
was
wont
to
regard
japan
as
barbarous
while
she
indulged
in
the
gentle
arts
of
peace
he
calls
her
civilised
since
she
began
to
commit
wholesale
slaughter
on
manchurian
battlefields
much
comment
has
been
given
lately
to
the
code
of
the
samurai
the
art
of
death
which
makes
our
soldiers
exult
in
but
scarcely
any
attention
has
been
drawn
to
teaism
which
represents
so
much
of
our
art
of
life
fain
would
we
remain
barbarians
if
our
claim
to
civilisation
were
to
be
based
on
the
gruesome
glory
of
war
fain
would
we
await
the
time
when
due
respect
shall
be
paid
to
our
art
and
ideals
when
will
the
west
understand
or
try
to
understand
the
east
we
asiatics
are
often
appalled
by
the
curious
web
of
facts
and
fancies
which
has
been
woven
concerning
us
we
are
pictured
as
living
on
the
perfume
of
the
lotus
if
not
on
mice
and
cockroaches
it
is
either
impotent
fanaticism
or
else
abject
voluptuousness
indian
spirituality
has
been
derided
as
ignorance
chinese
sobriety
as
stupidity
japanese
patriotism
as
the
result
of
fatalism
it
has
been
said
that
we
are
less
sensible
to
pain
and
wounds
on
account
of
the
callousness
of
our
nervous
organisation
why
not
amuse
yourselves
at
our
expense
asia
returns
the
compliment
there
would
be
further
food
for
merriment
if
you
were
to
know
all
that
we
have
imagined
and
written
about
you
all
the
glamour
of
the
perspective
is
there
all
the
unconscious
homage
of
wonder
all
the
silent
resentment
of
the
new
and
undefined
you
have
been
loaded
with
virtues
too
refined
to
be
envied
and
accused
of
crimes
too
picturesque
to
be
condemned
our
writers
in
the
past
the
wise
men
who
knew
informed
us
that
you
had
bushy
tails
somewhere
hidden
in
your
garments
and
often
dined
off
a
fricassee
of
newborn
babes
nay
we
had
something
worse
against
you
we
used
to
think
you
the
most
impracticable
people
on
the
earth
for
you
were
said
to
preach
what
you
never
practiced
such
misconceptions
are
fast
vanishing
amongst
us
commerce
has
forced
the
european
tongues
on
many
an
eastern
port
asiatic
youths
are
flocking
to
western
colleges
for
the
equipment
of
modern
education
our
insight
does
not
penetrate
your
culture
deeply
but
at
least
we
are
willing
to
learn
some
of
my
compatriots
have
adopted
too
much
of
your
customs
and
too
much
of
your
etiquette
in
the
delusion
that
the
acquisition
of
stiff
collars
and
tall
silk
hats
comprised
the
attainment
of
your
civilisation
pathetic
and
deplorable
as
such
affectations
are
they
evince
our
willingness
to
approach
the
west
on
our
knees
unfortunately
the
western
attitude
is
unfavourable
to
the
understanding
of
the
east
the
christian
missionary
goes
to
impart
but
not
to
receive
your
information
is
based
on
the
meagre
translations
of
our
immense
literature
if
not
on
the
unreliable
anecdotes
of
passing
travellers
it
is
rarely
that
the
chivalrous
pen
of
a
lafcadio
hearn
or
that
of
the
author
of
the
web
of
indian
life
enlivens
the
oriental
darkness
with
the
torch
of
our
own
sentiments
perhaps
i
betray
my
own
ignorance
of
the
tea
cult
by
being
so
outspoken
its
very
spirit
of
politeness
exacts
that
you
say
what
you
are
expected
to
say
and
no
more
but
i
am
not
to
be
a
polite
teaist
so
much
harm
has
been
done
already
by
the
mutual
misunderstanding
of
the
new
world
and
the
old
that
one
need
not
apologise
for
contributing
his
tithe
to
the
furtherance
of
a
better
understanding
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
century
would
have
been
spared
the
spectacle
of
sanguinary
warfare
if
russia
had
condescended
to
know
japan
better
what
dire
consequences
to
humanity
lie
in
the
contemptuous
ignoring
of
eastern
problems
european
imperialism
which
does
not
disdain
to
raise
the
absurd
cry
of
the
yellow
peril
fails
to
realise
that
asia
may
also
awaken
to
the
cruel
sense
of
the
white
disaster
you
may
laugh
at
us
for
having
too
much
tea
but
may
we
not
suspect
that
you
of
the
west
have
no
tea
in
your
constitution
let
us
stop
the
continents
from
hurling
epigrams
at
each
other
and
be
sadder
if
not
wiser
by
the
mutual
gain
of
half
a
hemisphere
we
have
developed
along
different
lines
but
there
is
no
reason
why
one
should
not
supplement
the
other
you
have
gained
expansion
at
the
cost
of
restlessness
we
have
created
a
harmony
which
is
weak
against
aggression
will
you
believe
it
the
east
is
better
off
in
some
respects
than
the
west
strangely
enough
humanity
has
so
far
met
in
the
it
is
the
only
asiatic
ceremonial
which
commands
universal
esteem
the
white
man
has
scoffed
at
our
religion
and
our
morals
but
has
accepted
the
brown
beverage
without
hesitation
the
afternoon
tea
is
now
an
important
function
in
western
society
in
the
delicate
clatter
of
trays
and
saucers
in
the
soft
rustle
of
feminine
hospitality
in
the
common
catechism
about
cream
and
sugar
we
know
that
the
worship
of
tea
is
established
beyond
question
the
philosophic
resignation
of
the
guest
to
the
fate
awaiting
him
in
the
dubious
decoction
proclaims
that
in
this
single
instance
the
oriental
spirit
reigns
supreme
the
earliest
record
of
tea
in
european
writing
is
said
to
be
found
in
the
statement
of
an
arabian
traveller
that
after
the
year
the
main
sources
of
revenue
in
canton
were
the
duties
on
salt
and
tea
marco
polo
records
the
deposition
of
a
chinese
minister
of
finance
in
for
his
arbitrary
augmentation
of
the
it
was
at
the
period
of
the
great
discoveries
that
the
european
people
began
to
know
more
about
the
extreme
orient
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
hollanders
brought
the
news
that
a
pleasant
drink
was
made
in
the
east
from
the
leaves
of
a
bush
the
travellers
giovanni
batista
ramusio
almeida
maffeno
tareira
also
mentioned
tea
in
the
year
ships
of
the
dutch
east
india
company
brought
the
first
tea
into
europe
it
was
known
in
france
in
and
reached
russia
in
england
welcomed
it
in
and
spoke
of
it
as
that
excellent
and
by
all
physicians
approved
china
drink
called
by
the
chineans
tcha
and
by
other
nations
tay
alias
tee
like
all
good
things
of
the
world
the
propaganda
of
tea
met
with
opposition
heretics
like
henry
saville
denounced
drinking
it
as
a
filthy
custom
jonas
hanway
essay
on
tea
said
that
men
seemed
to
lose
their
stature
and
comeliness
women
their
beauty
through
the
use
of
tea
its
cost
at
the
start
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
shillings
a
pound
forbade
popular
consumption
and
made
it
regalia
for
high
treatments
and
entertainments
presents
being
made
thereof
to
princes
and
grandees
yet
in
spite
of
such
drawbacks
spread
with
marvelous
rapidity
the
of
london
in
the
early
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
became
in
fact
the
resort
of
wits
like
addison
and
steele
who
beguiled
themselves
over
their
dish
of
tea
the
beverage
soon
became
a
necessity
of
life
a
taxable
matter
we
are
reminded
in
this
connection
what
an
important
part
it
plays
in
modern
history
colonial
america
resigned
herself
to
oppression
until
human
endurance
gave
way
before
the
heavy
duties
laid
on
tea
american
independence
dates
from
the
throwing
of
into
boston
harbour
there
is
a
subtle
charm
in
the
taste
of
tea
which
makes
it
irresistible
and
capable
of
idealisation
western
humourists
were
not
slow
to
mingle
the
fragrance
of
their
thought
with
its
aroma
it
has
not
the
arrogance
of
wine
the
of
coffee
nor
the
simpering
innocence
of
cocoa
already
in
says
the
spectator
i
would
therefore
in
a
particular
manner
recommend
these
my
speculations
to
all
families
that
set
apart
an
hour
every
morning
for
tea
bread
and
butter
and
would
earnestly
advise
them
for
their
good
to
order
this
paper
to
be
punctually
served
up
and
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
part
of
the
samuel
johnson
draws
his
own
portrait
as
a
hardened
and
shameless
tea
drinker
who
for
twenty
years
diluted
his
meals
with
only
the
infusion
of
the
fascinating
plant
who
with
tea
amused
the
evening
with
tea
solaced
the
midnight
and
with
tea
welcomed
the
morning
charles
lamb
a
professed
devotee
sounded
the
true
note
of
teaism
when
he
wrote
that
the
greatest
pleasure
he
knew
was
to
do
a
good
action
by
stealth
and
to
have
it
found
out
by
accident
for
teaism
is
the
art
of
concealing
beauty
that
you
may
discover
it
of
suggesting
what
you
dare
not
reveal
it
is
the
noble
secret
of
laughing
at
yourself
calmly
yet
thoroughly
and
is
thus
humour
itself
the
smile
of
philosophy
all
genuine
humourists
may
in
this
sense
be
called
thackeray
for
instance
and
of
course
shakespeare
the
poets
of
the
decadence
when
was
not
the
world
in
decadence
in
their
protests
against
materialism
have
to
a
certain
extent
also
opened
the
way
to
teaism
perhaps
nowadays
it
is
our
demure
contemplation
of
the
imperfect
that
the
west
and
the
east
can
meet
in
mutual
consolation
the
taoists
relate
that
at
the
great
beginning
of
the
spirit
and
matter
met
in
mortal
combat
at
last
the
yellow
emperor
the
sun
of
heaven
triumphed
over
shuhyung
the
demon
of
darkness
and
earth
the
titan
in
his
death
agony
struck
his
head
against
the
solar
vault
and
shivered
the
blue
dome
of
jade
into
fragments
the
stars
lost
their
nests
the
moon
wandered
aimlessly
among
the
wild
chasms
of
the
night
in
despair
the
yellow
emperor
sought
far
and
wide
for
the
repairer
of
the
heavens
he
had
not
to
search
in
vain
out
of
the
eastern
sea
rose
a
queen
the
divine
niuka
and
resplendent
in
her
armor
of
fire
she
welded
the
rainbow
in
her
magic
cauldron
and
rebuilt
the
chinese
sky
but
it
is
told
that
niuka
forgot
to
fill
two
tiny
crevices
in
the
blue
firmament
thus
began
the
dualism
of
love
two
souls
rolling
through
space
and
never
at
rest
until
they
join
together
to
complete
the
universe
everyone
has
to
build
anew
his
sky
of
hope
and
peace
the
heaven
of
modern
humanity
is
indeed
shattered
in
the
cyclopean
struggle
for
wealth
and
power
the
world
is
groping
in
the
shadow
of
egotism
and
vulgarity
knowledge
is
bought
through
a
bad
conscience
benevolence
practiced
for
the
sake
of
utility
the
east
and
the
west
like
two
dragons
tossed
in
a
sea
of
ferment
in
vain
strive
to
regain
the
jewel
of
life
we
need
a
niuka
again
to
repair
the
grand
devastation
we
await
the
great
avatar
meanwhile
let
us
have
a
sip
of
tea
the
afternoon
glow
is
brightening
the
bamboos
the
fountains
are
bubbling
with
delight
the
soughing
of
the
pines
is
heard
in
our
kettle
let
us
dream
of
evanescence
and
linger
in
the
beautiful
foolishness
of
things
ii
the
schools
of
tea
tea
is
a
work
of
art
and
needs
a
master
hand
to
bring
out
its
noblest
qualities
we
have
good
and
bad
tea
as
we
have
good
and
bad
paintings
generally
the
latter
there
is
no
single
recipe
for
making
the
perfect
tea
as
there
are
no
rules
for
producing
a
titian
or
a
sesson
each
preparation
of
the
leaves
has
its
individuality
its
special
affinity
with
water
and
heat
its
own
method
of
telling
a
story
the
truly
beautiful
must
always
be
in
it
how
much
do
we
not
suffer
through
the
constant
failure
of
society
to
recognise
this
simple
and
fundamental
law
of
art
and
life
lichilai
a
sung
poet
has
sadly
remarked
that
there
were
three
most
deplorable
things
in
the
world
the
spoiling
of
fine
youths
through
false
education
the
degradation
of
fine
art
through
vulgar
admiration
and
the
utter
waste
of
fine
tea
through
incompetent
manipulation
like
art
tea
has
its
periods
and
its
schools
its
evolution
may
be
roughly
divided
into
three
main
stages
the
boiled
tea
the
whipped
tea
and
the
steeped
tea
we
moderns
belong
to
the
last
school
these
several
methods
of
appreciating
the
beverage
are
indicative
of
the
spirit
of
the
age
in
which
they
prevailed
for
life
is
an
expression
our
unconscious
actions
the
constant
betrayal
of
our
innermost
thought
confucius
said
that
man
hideth
not
perhaps
we
reveal
ourselves
too
much
in
small
things
because
we
have
so
little
of
the
great
to
conceal
the
tiny
incidents
of
daily
routine
are
as
much
a
commentary
of
racial
ideals
as
the
highest
flight
of
philosophy
or
poetry
even
as
the
difference
in
favorite
vintage
marks
the
separate
idiosyncrasies
of
different
periods
and
nationalities
of
europe
so
the
characterise
the
various
moods
of
oriental
culture
the
which
was
boiled
the
which
was
whipped
the
which
was
steeped
mark
the
distinct
emotional
impulses
of
the
tang
the
sung
and
the
ming
dynasties
of
china
if
we
were
inclined
to
borrow
the
terminology
of
we
might
designate
them
respectively
the
classic
the
romantic
and
the
naturalistic
schools
of
tea
the
a
native
of
southern
china
was
known
from
very
early
times
to
chinese
botany
and
medicine
it
is
alluded
to
in
the
classics
under
the
various
names
of
tou
tseh
chung
kha
and
ming
and
was
highly
prized
for
possessing
the
virtues
of
relieving
fatigue
delighting
the
soul
strengthening
the
will
and
repairing
the
eyesight
it
was
not
only
administered
as
an
internal
dose
but
often
applied
externally
in
form
of
paste
to
alleviate
rheumatic
pains
the
taoists
claimed
it
as
an
important
ingredient
of
the
elixir
of
immortality
the
buddhists
used
it
extensively
to
prevent
drowsiness
during
their
long
hours
of
meditation
by
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
tea
became
a
favourite
beverage
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
it
was
about
this
time
that
modern
ideograph
cha
was
coined
evidently
a
corruption
of
the
classic
tou
the
poets
of
the
southern
dynasties
have
left
some
fragments
of
their
fervent
adoration
of
the
froth
of
the
liquid
jade
then
emperors
used
to
bestow
some
rare
preparation
of
the
leaves
on
their
high
ministers
as
a
reward
for
eminent
services
yet
the
method
of
drinking
tea
at
this
stage
was
primitive
in
the
extreme
the
leaves
were
steamed
crushed
in
a
mortar
made
into
a
cake
and
boiled
together
with
rice
ginger
salt
orange
peel
spices
milk
and
sometimes
with
onions
the
custom
obtains
at
the
present
day
among
the
thibetans
and
various
mongolian
tribes
who
make
a
curious
syrup
of
these
ingredients
the
use
of
lemon
slices
by
the
russians
who
learned
to
take
tea
from
the
chinese
caravansaries
points
to
the
survival
of
the
ancient
method
it
needed
the
genius
of
the
tang
dynasty
to
emancipate
tea
from
its
crude
state
and
lead
to
its
final
idealization
with
luwuh
in
the
middle
of
the
eighth
century
we
have
our
first
apostle
of
tea
he
was
born
in
an
age
when
buddhism
taoism
and
confucianism
were
seeking
mutual
synthesis
the
pantheistic
symbolism
of
the
time
was
urging
one
to
mirror
the
universal
in
the
particular
luwuh
a
poet
saw
in
the
the
same
harmony
and
order
which
reigned
through
all
things
in
his
celebrated
work
the
chaking
the
holy
scripture
of
tea
he
formulated
the
code
of
tea
he
has
since
been
worshipped
as
the
tutelary
god
of
the
chinese
tea
merchants
the
chaking
consists
of
three
volumes
and
ten
chapters
in
the
first
chapter
luwuh
treats
of
the
nature
of
the
in
the
second
of
the
implements
for
gathering
the
leaves
in
the
third
of
the
selection
of
the
leaves
according
to
him
the
best
quality
of
the
leaves
must
have
creases
like
the
leathern
boot
of
tartar
horsemen
curl
like
the
dewlap
of
a
mighty
bullock
unfold
like
a
mist
rising
out
of
a
ravine
gleam
like
a
lake
touched
by
a
zephyr
and
be
wet
and
soft
like
fine
earth
newly
swept
by
rain
the
fourth
chapter
is
devoted
to
the
enumeration
and
description
of
the
members
of
the
beginning
with
the
tripod
brazier
and
ending
with
the
bamboo
cabinet
for
containing
all
these
utensils
here
we
notice
luwuh
predilection
for
taoist
symbolism
also
it
is
interesting
to
observe
in
this
connection
the
influence
of
tea
on
chinese
ceramics
the
celestial
porcelain
as
is
well
known
had
its
origin
in
an
attempt
to
reproduce
the
exquisite
shade
of
jade
resulting
in
the
tang
dynasty
in
the
blue
glaze
of
the
south
and
the
white
glaze
of
the
north
luwuh
considered
the
blue
as
the
ideal
colour
for
the
as
it
lent
additional
greenness
to
the
beverage
whereas
the
white
made
it
look
pinkish
and
distasteful
it
was
because
he
used
later
on
when
the
tea
masters
of
sung
took
to
the
powdered
tea
they
preferred
heavy
bowls
of
and
dark
brown
the
mings
with
their
steeped
tea
rejoiced
in
light
ware
of
white
porcelain
in
the
fifth
chapter
luwuh
describes
the
method
of
making
tea
he
eliminates
all
ingredients
except
salt
he
dwells
also
on
the
question
of
the
choice
of
water
and
the
degree
of
boiling
it
according
to
him
the
mountain
spring
is
the
best
the
river
water
and
the
spring
water
come
next
in
the
order
of
excellence
there
are
three
stages
of
boiling
the
first
boil
is
when
the
little
bubbles
like
the
eye
of
fishes
swim
on
the
surface
the
second
boil
is
when
the
bubbles
are
like
crystal
beads
rolling
in
a
fountain
the
third
boil
is
when
the
billows
surge
wildly
in
the
kettle
the
is
roasted
before
the
fire
until
it
becomes
soft
like
a
baby
arm
and
is
shredded
into
powder
between
pieces
of
fine
paper
salt
is
put
in
the
first
boil
the
tea
in
the
second
at
the
third
boil
a
dipperful
of
cold
water
is
poured
into
the
kettle
to
settle
the
tea
and
revive
the
youth
of
the
water
then
the
beverage
was
poured
into
cups
and
drunk
o
nectar
the
filmy
leaflet
hung
like
scaly
clouds
in
a
serene
sky
or
floated
like
waterlilies
on
emerald
streams
it
was
of
such
a
beverage
that
lotung
a
tang
poet
wrote
the
first
cup
moistens
my
lips
and
throat
the
second
cup
breaks
my
loneliness
the
third
cup
searches
my
barren
entrail
but
to
find
therein
some
five
thousand
volumes
of
odd
ideographs
the
fourth
cup
raises
a
slight
perspiration
all
the
wrong
of
life
passes
away
through
my
pores
at
the
fifth
cup
i
am
purified
the
sixth
cup
calls
me
to
the
realms
of
the
immortals
the
seventh
cup
ah
but
i
could
take
no
more
i
only
feel
the
breath
of
cool
wind
that
rises
in
my
sleeves
where
is
horaisan
let
me
ride
on
this
sweet
breeze
and
waft
away
thither
the
remaining
chapters
of
the
chaking
treat
of
the
vulgarity
of
the
ordinary
methods
of
a
historical
summary
of
illustrious
the
famous
tea
plantations
of
china
the
possible
variations
of
the
and
illustrations
of
the
the
last
is
unfortunately
lost
the
appearance
of
the
chaking
must
have
created
considerable
sensation
at
the
time
luwuh
was
befriended
by
the
emperor
taisung
and
his
fame
attracted
many
followers
some
exquisites
were
said
to
have
been
able
to
detect
the
tea
made
by
luwuh
from
that
of
his
disciples
one
mandarin
has
his
name
immortalised
by
his
failure
to
appreciate
the
tea
of
this
great
master
in
the
sung
dynasty
the
whipped
tea
came
into
fashion
and
created
the
second
school
of
tea
the
leaves
were
ground
to
fine
powder
in
a
small
stone
mill
and
the
preparation
was
whipped
in
hot
water
by
a
delicate
whisk
made
of
split
bamboo
the
new
process
led
to
some
change
in
the
of
luwuh
as
well
as
in
the
choice
of
leaves
salt
was
discarded
forever
the
enthusiasm
of
the
sung
people
for
tea
knew
no
bounds
epicures
vied
with
each
other
in
discovering
new
varieties
and
regular
tournaments
were
held
to
decide
their
superiority
the
emperor
kiasung
who
was
too
great
an
artist
to
be
a
monarch
lavished
his
treasures
on
the
attainment
of
rare
species
he
himself
wrote
a
dissertation
on
the
twenty
kinds
of
tea
among
which
he
prizes
the
white
tea
as
of
the
rarest
and
finest
quality
the
of
the
sungs
differed
from
the
tangs
even
as
their
notion
of
life
differed
they
sought
to
actualize
what
their
predecessors
tried
to
symbolise
to
the
mind
the
cosmic
law
was
not
reflected
in
the
phenomenal
world
but
the
phenomenal
world
was
the
cosmic
law
itself
aeons
were
but
moments
nirvana
always
within
grasp
the
taoist
conception
that
immortality
lay
in
the
eternal
change
permeated
all
their
modes
of
thought
it
was
the
process
not
the
deed
which
was
interesting
it
was
the
completing
not
the
completion
which
was
really
vital
man
came
thus
at
once
face
to
face
with
nature
a
new
meaning
grew
into
the
art
of
life
the
tea
began
to
be
not
a
poetical
pastime
but
one
of
the
methods
of
wangyucheng
eulogised
tea
as
flooding
his
soul
like
a
direct
appeal
that
its
delicate
bitterness
reminded
him
of
the
aftertaste
of
a
good
counsel
sotumpa
wrote
of
the
strength
of
the
immaculate
purity
in
tea
which
defied
corruption
as
a
truly
virtuous
man
among
the
buddhists
the
southern
zen
sect
which
incorporated
so
much
of
taoist
doctrines
formulated
an
elaborate
ritual
of
tea
the
monks
gathered
before
the
image
of
bodhi
dharma
and
drank
tea
out
of
a
single
bowl
with
the
profound
formality
of
a
holy
sacrament
it
was
this
zen
ritual
which
finally
developed
into
the
of
japan
in
the
fifteenth
century
unfortunately
the
sudden
outburst
of
the
mongol
tribes
in
the
thirteenth
century
which
resulted
in
the
devastation
and
conquest
of
china
under
the
barbaric
rule
of
the
yuen
emperors
destroyed
all
the
fruits
of
sung
culture
the
native
dynasty
of
the
mings
which
attempted
in
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
was
harassed
by
internal
troubles
and
china
again
fell
under
the
alien
rule
of
the
manchus
in
the
seventeenth
century
manners
and
customs
changed
to
leave
no
vestige
of
the
former
times
the
powdered
tea
is
entirely
forgotten
we
find
a
ming
commentator
at
loss
to
recall
the
shape
of
the
tea
whisk
mentioned
in
one
of
the
sung
classics
tea
is
now
taken
by
steeping
the
leaves
in
hot
water
in
a
bowl
or
cup
the
reason
why
the
western
world
is
innocent
of
the
older
method
of
drinking
tea
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
europe
knew
it
only
at
the
close
of
the
ming
dynasty
to
the
chinese
tea
is
a
delicious
beverage
but
not
an
ideal
the
long
woes
of
his
country
have
robbed
him
of
the
zest
for
the
meaning
of
life
he
has
become
modern
that
is
to
say
old
and
disenchanted
he
has
lost
that
sublime
faith
in
illusions
which
constitutes
the
eternal
youth
and
vigour
of
the
poets
and
ancients
he
is
an
eclectic
and
politely
accepts
the
traditions
of
the
universe
he
toys
with
nature
but
does
not
condescend
to
conquer
or
worship
her
his
is
often
wonderful
with
its
aroma
but
the
romance
of
the
tang
and
sung
ceremonials
are
not
to
be
found
in
his
cup
japan
which
followed
closely
on
the
footsteps
of
chinese
civilisation
has
known
the
tea
in
all
its
three
stages
as
early
as
the
year
we
read
of
the
emperor
shomu
giving
tea
to
one
hundred
monks
at
his
palace
in
nara
the
leaves
were
probably
imported
by
our
ambassadors
to
the
tang
court
and
prepared
in
the
way
then
in
fashion
in
the
monk
saicho
brought
back
some
seeds
and
planted
them
in
yeisan
many
are
heard
of
in
succeeding
centuries
as
well
as
the
delight
of
the
aristocracy
and
priesthood
in
the
beverage
the
sung
tea
reached
us
in
with
the
return
of
who
went
there
to
study
the
southern
zen
school
the
new
seeds
which
he
carried
home
were
successfully
planted
in
three
places
one
of
which
the
uji
district
near
kioto
bears
still
the
name
of
producing
the
best
tea
in
the
world
the
southern
zen
spread
with
marvelous
rapidity
and
with
it
the
and
the
of
the
sung
by
the
fifteenth
century
under
the
patronage
of
the
shogun
the
tea
ceremony
is
fully
constituted
and
made
into
an
independent
and
secular
performance
since
then
teaism
is
fully
established
in
japan
the
use
of
the
steeped
tea
of
the
later
china
is
comparatively
recent
among
us
being
only
known
since
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
has
replaced
the
powdered
tea
in
ordinary
consumption
though
the
latter
still
continues
to
hold
its
place
as
the
tea
of
teas
it
is
in
the
japanese
tea
ceremony
that
we
see
the
culmination
of
our
successful
resistance
of
the
mongol
invasion
in
had
enabled
us
to
carry
on
the
sung
movement
so
disastrously
cut
off
in
china
itself
through
the
nomadic
inroad
tea
with
us
became
more
than
an
idealisation
of
the
form
of
drinking
it
is
a
religion
of
the
art
of
life
the
beverage
grew
to
be
an
excuse
for
the
worship
of
purity
and
refinement
a
sacred
function
at
which
the
host
and
guest
joined
to
produce
for
that
occasion
the
utmost
beatitude
of
the
mundane
the
was
an
oasis
in
the
dreary
waste
of
existence
where
weary
travellers
could
meet
to
drink
from
the
common
spring
of
the
ceremony
was
an
improvised
drama
whose
plot
was
woven
about
the
tea
the
flowers
and
the
paintings
not
a
colour
to
disturb
the
tone
of
the
room
not
a
sound
to
mar
the
rhythm
of
things
not
a
gesture
to
obtrude
on
the
harmony
not
a
word
to
break
the
unity
of
the
surroundings
all
movements
to
be
performed
simply
and
naturally
such
were
the
aims
of
the
and
strangely
enough
it
was
often
successful
a
subtle
philosophy
lay
behind
it
all
teaism
was
taoism
in
disguise
iii
taoism
and
zennism
the
connection
of
zennism
with
tea
is
proverbial
we
have
already
remarked
that
the
was
a
development
of
the
zen
ritual
the
name
of
laotse
the
founder
of
taoism
is
also
intimately
associated
with
the
history
of
tea
it
is
written
in
the
chinese
school
manual
concerning
the
origin
of
habits
and
customs
that
the
ceremony
of
offering
tea
to
a
guest
began
with
kwanyin
a
disciple
of
laotse
who
first
at
the
gate
of
the
han
pass
presented
to
the
old
philosopher
a
cup
of
the
golden
elixir
we
shall
not
stop
to
discuss
the
authenticity
of
such
tales
which
are
valuable
however
as
confirming
the
early
use
of
the
beverage
by
the
taoists
our
interest
in
taoism
and
zennism
here
lies
mainly
in
those
ideas
regarding
life
and
art
which
are
so
embodied
in
what
we
call
teaism
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
as
yet
there
appears
to
be
no
adequate
presentation
of
the
taoists
and
zen
doctrines
in
any
foreign
language
though
we
have
had
several
laudable
attempts
translation
is
always
a
treason
and
as
a
ming
author
observes
can
at
its
best
be
only
the
reverse
side
of
a
brocade
all
the
threads
are
there
but
not
the
subtlety
of
colour
or
design
but
after
all
what
great
doctrine
is
there
which
is
easy
to
expound
the
ancient
sages
never
put
their
teachings
in
systematic
form
they
spoke
in
paradoxes
for
they
were
afraid
of
uttering
they
began
by
talking
like
fools
and
ended
by
making
their
hearers
wise
laotse
himself
with
his
quaint
humour
says
if
people
of
inferior
intelligence
hear
of
the
tao
they
laugh
immensely
it
would
not
be
the
tao
unless
they
laughed
at
it
the
tao
literally
means
a
path
it
has
been
severally
translated
as
the
way
the
absolute
the
law
nature
supreme
reason
the
mode
these
renderings
are
not
incorrect
for
the
use
of
the
term
by
the
taoists
differs
according
to
the
of
the
inquiry
laotse
himself
spoke
of
it
thus
there
is
a
thing
which
is
which
was
born
before
the
existence
of
heaven
and
earth
how
silent
how
solitary
it
stands
alone
and
changes
not
it
revolves
without
danger
to
itself
and
is
the
mother
of
the
universe
i
do
not
know
its
name
and
so
call
it
the
path
with
reluctance
i
call
it
the
infinite
infinity
is
the
fleeting
the
fleeting
is
the
vanishing
the
vanishing
is
the
reverting
the
tao
is
in
the
passage
rather
than
the
path
it
is
the
spirit
of
cosmic
change
the
eternal
growth
which
returns
upon
itself
to
produce
new
forms
it
recoils
upon
itself
like
the
dragon
the
beloved
symbol
of
the
taoists
it
folds
and
unfolds
as
do
the
clouds
the
tao
might
be
spoken
of
as
the
great
transition
subjectively
it
is
the
mood
of
the
universe
its
absolute
is
the
relative
it
should
be
remembered
in
the
first
place
that
taoism
like
its
legitimate
successor
zennism
represents
the
individualistic
trend
of
the
southern
chinese
mind
in
to
the
communism
of
northern
china
which
expressed
itself
in
confucianism
the
middle
kingdom
is
as
vast
as
europe
and
has
a
differentiation
of
idiosyncrasies
marked
by
the
two
great
river
systems
which
traverse
it
the
and
are
respectively
the
mediterranean
and
the
baltic
even
in
spite
of
centuries
of
unification
the
southern
celestial
differs
in
his
thoughts
and
beliefs
from
his
northern
brother
as
a
member
of
the
latin
race
differs
from
the
teuton
in
ancient
days
when
communication
was
even
more
difficult
than
at
present
and
especially
during
the
feudal
period
this
difference
in
thought
was
most
pronounced
the
art
and
poetry
of
the
one
breathes
an
atmosphere
entirely
distinct
from
that
of
the
other
in
laotse
and
his
followers
and
in
kutsugen
the
forerunner
of
the
we
find
an
idealism
quite
inconsistent
with
the
prosaic
ethical
notions
of
their
contemporary
northern
writers
laotse
lived
five
centuries
before
the
christian
era
the
germ
of
taoist
speculation
may
be
found
long
before
the
advent
of
laotse
surnamed
the
the
archaic
records
of
china
especially
the
book
of
changes
foreshadow
his
thought
but
the
great
respect
paid
to
the
laws
and
customs
of
that
classic
period
of
chinese
civilisation
which
culminated
with
the
establishment
of
the
chow
dynasty
in
the
sixteenth
century
kept
the
development
of
individualism
in
check
for
a
long
while
so
that
it
was
not
until
after
the
disintegration
of
the
chow
dynasty
and
the
establishment
of
innumerable
independent
kingdoms
that
it
was
able
to
blossom
forth
in
the
luxuriance
of
laotse
and
soshi
chuangtse
were
both
southerners
and
the
greatest
exponents
of
the
new
school
on
the
other
hand
confucius
with
his
numerous
disciples
aimed
at
retaining
ancestral
conventions
taoism
can
not
be
understood
without
some
knowledge
of
confucianism
and
vice
versa
we
have
said
that
the
taoist
absolute
was
the
relative
in
ethics
the
taoist
railed
at
the
laws
and
the
moral
codes
of
society
for
to
them
right
and
wrong
were
but
relative
terms
definition
is
always
limitation
the
fixed
and
unchangeless
are
but
terms
expressive
of
a
stoppage
of
growth
said
kuzugen
the
sages
move
the
world
our
standards
of
morality
are
begotten
of
the
past
needs
of
society
but
is
society
to
remain
always
the
same
the
observance
of
communal
traditions
involves
a
constant
sacrifice
of
the
individual
to
the
state
education
in
order
to
keep
up
the
mighty
delusion
encourages
a
species
of
ignorance
people
are
not
taught
to
be
really
virtuous
but
to
behave
properly
we
are
wicked
because
we
are
frightfully
we
nurse
a
conscience
because
we
are
afraid
to
tell
the
truth
to
others
we
take
refuge
in
pride
because
we
are
afraid
to
tell
the
truth
to
ourselves
how
can
one
be
serious
with
the
world
when
the
world
itself
is
so
ridiculous
the
spirit
of
barter
is
everywhere
honour
and
chastity
behold
the
complacent
salesman
retailing
the
good
and
true
one
can
even
buy
a
religion
which
is
really
but
common
morality
sanctified
with
flowers
and
music
rob
the
church
of
her
accessories
and
what
remains
behind
yet
the
trusts
thrive
marvelously
for
the
prices
are
absurdly
cheap
a
prayer
for
a
ticket
to
heaven
a
diploma
for
an
honourable
citizenship
hide
yourself
under
a
bushel
quickly
for
if
your
real
usefulness
were
known
to
the
world
you
would
soon
be
knocked
down
to
the
highest
bidder
by
the
public
auctioneer
why
do
men
and
women
like
to
advertise
themselves
so
much
is
it
not
but
an
instinct
derived
from
the
days
of
slavery
the
virility
of
the
idea
lies
not
less
in
its
power
of
breaking
through
contemporary
thought
than
in
its
capacity
for
dominating
subsequent
movements
taoism
was
an
active
power
during
the
shin
dynasty
that
epoch
of
chinese
unification
from
which
we
derive
the
name
china
it
would
be
interesting
had
we
time
to
note
its
influence
on
contemporary
thinkers
the
mathematicians
writers
on
law
and
war
the
mystics
and
alchemists
and
the
later
of
the
we
should
not
even
ignore
those
speculators
on
reality
who
doubted
whether
a
white
horse
was
real
because
he
was
white
or
because
he
was
solid
nor
the
conversationalists
of
the
six
dynasties
who
like
the
zen
philosophers
revelled
in
discussions
concerning
the
pure
and
the
abstract
above
all
we
should
pay
homage
to
taoism
for
what
it
has
done
toward
the
formation
of
the
celestial
character
giving
to
it
a
certain
capacity
for
reserve
and
refinement
as
warm
as
jade
chinese
history
is
full
of
instances
in
which
the
votaries
of
taoism
princes
and
hermits
alike
followed
with
varied
and
interesting
results
the
teachings
of
their
creed
the
tale
will
not
be
without
its
quota
of
instruction
and
amusement
it
will
be
rich
in
anecdotes
allegories
and
aphorisms
we
would
fain
be
on
speaking
terms
with
the
delightful
emperor
who
never
died
because
he
had
never
lived
we
may
ride
the
wind
with
liehtse
and
find
it
absolutely
quiet
because
we
ourselves
are
the
wind
or
dwell
in
with
the
aged
one
of
the
who
lived
betwixt
heaven
and
earth
because
he
was
subject
to
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
even
in
that
grotesque
apology
for
taoism
which
we
find
in
china
at
the
present
day
we
can
revel
in
a
wealth
of
imagery
impossible
to
find
in
any
other
cult
but
the
chief
contribution
of
taoism
to
asiatic
life
has
been
in
the
realm
of
aesthetics
chinese
historians
have
always
spoken
of
taoism
as
the
art
of
being
in
the
world
for
it
deals
with
the
present
ourselves
it
is
in
us
that
god
meets
with
nature
and
yesterday
parts
from
the
present
is
the
moving
infinity
the
legitimate
sphere
of
the
relative
relativity
seeks
adjustment
adjustment
is
art
the
art
of
life
lies
in
a
constant
readjustment
to
our
surroundings
taoism
accepts
the
mundane
as
it
is
and
unlike
the
confucians
or
the
buddhists
tries
to
find
beauty
in
our
world
of
woe
and
worry
the
sung
allegory
of
the
three
vinegar
tasters
explains
admirably
the
trend
of
the
three
doctrines
sakyamuni
confucius
and
laotse
once
stood
before
a
jar
of
vinegar
the
emblem
of
life
and
each
dipped
in
his
finger
to
taste
the
brew
the
confucius
found
it
sour
the
buddha
called
it
bitter
and
laotse
pronounced
it
sweet
the
taoists
claimed
that
the
comedy
of
life
could
be
made
more
interesting
if
everyone
would
preserve
the
unities
to
keep
the
proportion
of
things
and
give
place
to
others
without
losing
one
own
position
was
the
secret
of
success
in
the
mundane
drama
we
must
know
the
whole
play
in
order
to
properly
act
our
parts
the
conception
of
totality
must
never
be
lost
in
that
of
the
individual
this
laotse
illustrates
by
his
favourite
metaphor
of
the
vacuum
he
claimed
that
only
in
vacuum
lay
the
truly
essential
the
reality
of
a
room
for
instance
was
to
be
found
in
the
vacant
space
enclosed
by
the
roof
and
the
walls
not
in
the
roof
and
walls
themselves
the
usefulness
of
a
water
pitcher
dwelt
in
the
emptiness
where
water
might
be
put
not
in
the
form
of
the
pitcher
or
the
material
of
which
it
was
made
vacuum
is
all
potent
because
all
containing
in
vacuum
alone
motion
becomes
possible
one
who
could
make
of
himself
a
vacuum
into
which
others
might
freely
enter
would
become
master
of
all
situations
the
whole
can
always
dominate
the
part
these
taoists
ideas
have
greatly
influenced
all
our
theories
of
action
even
to
those
of
fencing
and
wrestling
the
japanese
art
of
owes
its
name
to
a
passage
in
the
in
one
seeks
to
draw
out
and
exhaust
the
enemy
strength
by
vacuum
while
conserving
one
own
strength
for
victory
in
the
final
struggle
in
art
the
importance
of
the
same
principle
is
illustrated
by
the
value
of
suggestion
in
leaving
something
unsaid
the
beholder
is
given
a
chance
to
complete
the
idea
and
thus
a
great
masterpiece
irresistibly
rivets
your
attention
until
you
seem
to
become
actually
a
part
of
it
a
vacuum
is
there
for
you
to
enter
and
fill
up
the
full
measure
of
your
aesthetic
emotion
he
who
had
made
himself
master
of
the
art
of
living
was
the
real
man
of
the
taoist
at
birth
he
enters
the
realm
of
dreams
only
to
awaken
to
reality
at
death
he
tempers
his
own
brightness
in
order
to
merge
himself
into
the
obscurity
of
others
he
is
reluctant
as
one
who
crosses
a
stream
in
winter
hesitating
as
one
who
fears
the
neighbourhood
respectful
like
a
guest
trembling
like
ice
that
is
about
to
melt
unassuming
like
a
piece
of
wood
not
yet
carved
vacant
like
a
valley
formless
like
troubled
waters
to
him
the
three
jewels
of
life
were
pity
economy
and
modesty
if
now
we
turn
our
attention
to
zennism
we
shall
find
that
it
emphasises
the
teachings
of
taoism
zen
is
a
name
derived
from
the
sanscrit
word
dhyana
which
signifies
meditation
it
claims
that
through
consecrated
meditation
may
be
attained
supreme
meditation
is
one
of
the
six
ways
through
which
buddhahood
may
be
reached
and
the
zen
sectarians
affirm
that
sakyamuni
laid
special
stress
on
this
method
in
his
later
teachings
handing
down
the
rules
to
his
chief
disciple
kashiapa
according
to
their
tradition
kashiapa
the
first
zen
patriarch
imparted
the
secret
to
ananda
who
in
turn
passed
it
on
to
successive
patriarchs
until
it
reached
the
came
to
northern
china
in
the
early
half
of
the
sixth
century
and
was
the
first
patriarch
of
chinese
zen
there
is
much
uncertainty
about
the
history
of
these
patriarchs
and
their
doctrines
in
its
philosophical
aspect
early
zennism
seems
to
have
affinity
on
one
hand
to
the
indian
negativism
of
nagarjuna
and
on
the
other
to
the
gnan
philosophy
formulated
by
sancharacharya
the
first
teaching
of
zen
as
we
know
it
at
the
present
day
must
be
attributed
to
the
sixth
chinese
patriarch
yeno
founder
of
southern
zen
from
the
fact
of
its
predominance
in
southern
china
he
is
closely
followed
by
the
great
baso
died
who
made
of
zen
a
living
influence
in
celestial
life
hiakujo
the
pupil
of
baso
first
instituted
the
zen
monastery
and
established
a
ritual
and
regulations
for
its
government
in
the
discussions
of
the
zen
school
after
the
time
of
baso
we
find
the
play
of
the
mind
causing
an
accession
of
native
modes
of
thought
in
contrast
to
the
former
indian
idealism
whatever
sectarian
pride
may
assert
to
the
contrary
one
can
not
help
being
impressed
by
the
similarity
of
southern
zen
to
the
teachings
of
laotse
and
the
taoist
conversationalists
in
the
we
already
find
allusions
to
the
importance
of
and
the
need
of
properly
regulating
the
breath
essential
points
in
the
practice
of
zen
meditation
some
of
the
best
commentaries
on
the
book
of
laotse
have
been
written
by
zen
scholars
zennism
like
taoism
is
the
worship
of
relativity
one
master
defines
zen
as
the
art
of
feeling
the
polar
star
in
the
southern
sky
truth
can
be
reached
only
through
the
comprehension
of
opposites
again
zennism
like
taoism
is
a
strong
advocate
of
individualism
nothing
is
real
except
that
which
concerns
the
working
of
our
own
minds
yeno
the
sixth
patriarch
once
saw
two
monks
watching
the
flag
of
a
pagoda
fluttering
in
the
wind
one
said
it
is
the
wind
that
moves
the
other
said
it
is
the
flag
that
moves
but
yeno
explained
to
them
that
the
real
movement
was
neither
of
the
wind
nor
the
flag
but
of
something
within
their
own
minds
hiakujo
was
walking
in
the
forest
with
a
disciple
when
a
hare
scurried
off
at
their
approach
why
does
the
hare
fly
from
you
asked
hiakujo
because
he
is
afraid
of
me
was
the
answer
no
said
the
master
it
is
because
you
have
murderous
instinct
the
dialogue
recalls
that
of
soshi
chaungtse
the
taoist
one
day
soshi
was
walking
on
the
bank
of
a
river
with
a
friend
how
delightfully
the
fishes
are
enjoying
themselves
in
the
water
exclaimed
soshi
his
friend
spake
to
him
thus
you
are
not
a
fish
how
do
you
know
that
the
fishes
are
enjoying
themselves
you
are
not
myself
returned
soshi
how
do
you
know
that
i
do
not
know
that
the
fishes
are
enjoying
themselves
zen
was
often
opposed
to
the
precepts
of
orthodox
buddhism
even
as
taoism
was
opposed
to
confucianism
to
the
transcendental
insight
of
the
zen
words
were
but
an
incumbrance
to
thought
the
whole
sway
of
buddhist
scriptures
only
commentaries
on
personal
speculation
the
followers
of
zen
aimed
at
direct
communion
with
the
inner
nature
of
things
regarding
their
outward
accessories
only
as
impediments
to
a
clear
perception
of
truth
it
was
this
love
of
the
abstract
that
led
the
zen
to
prefer
black
and
white
sketches
to
the
elaborately
coloured
paintings
of
the
classic
buddhist
school
some
of
the
zen
even
became
iconoclastic
as
a
result
of
their
endeavor
to
recognise
the
buddha
in
themselves
rather
than
through
images
and
symbolism
we
find
tankawosho
breaking
up
a
wooden
statue
of
buddha
on
a
wintry
day
to
make
a
fire
what
sacrilege
said
the
bystander
i
wish
to
get
the
shali
out
of
the
ashes
calmly
rejoined
the
zen
but
you
certainly
will
not
get
shali
from
this
image
was
the
angry
retort
to
which
tanka
replied
if
i
do
not
this
is
certainly
not
a
buddha
and
i
am
committing
no
sacrilege
then
he
turned
to
warm
himself
over
the
kindling
fire
a
special
contribution
of
zen
to
eastern
thought
was
its
recognition
of
the
mundane
as
of
equal
importance
with
the
spiritual
it
held
that
in
the
great
relation
of
things
there
was
no
distinction
of
small
and
great
an
atom
possessing
equal
possibilities
with
the
universe
the
seeker
for
perfection
must
discover
in
his
own
life
the
reflection
of
the
inner
light
the
organisation
of
the
zen
monastery
was
very
significant
of
this
point
of
view
to
every
member
except
the
abbot
was
assigned
some
special
work
in
the
caretaking
of
the
monastery
and
curiously
enough
to
the
novices
was
committed
the
lighter
duties
while
to
the
most
respected
and
advanced
monks
were
given
the
more
irksome
and
menial
tasks
such
services
formed
a
part
of
the
zen
discipline
and
every
least
action
must
be
done
absolutely
perfectly
thus
many
a
weighty
discussion
ensued
while
weeding
the
garden
paring
a
turnip
or
serving
tea
the
whole
ideal
of
teaism
is
a
result
of
this
zen
conception
of
greatness
in
the
smallest
incidents
of
life
taoism
furnished
the
basis
for
aesthetic
ideals
zennism
made
them
practical
iv
the
to
european
architects
brought
up
on
the
traditions
of
stone
and
brick
construction
our
japanese
method
of
building
with
wood
and
bamboo
seems
scarcely
worthy
to
be
ranked
as
architecture
it
is
but
quite
recently
that
a
competent
student
of
western
architecture
has
recognised
and
paid
tribute
to
the
remarkable
perfection
of
our
great
temples
such
being
the
case
as
regards
our
classic
architecture
we
could
hardly
expect
the
outsider
to
appreciate
the
subtle
beauty
of
the
its
principles
of
construction
and
decoration
being
entirely
different
from
those
of
the
west
the
the
sukiya
does
not
pretend
to
be
other
than
a
mere
cottage
a
straw
hut
as
we
call
it
the
original
ideographs
for
sukiya
mean
the
abode
of
fancy
latterly
the
various
substituted
various
chinese
characters
according
to
their
conception
of
the
and
the
term
sukiya
may
signify
the
abode
of
vacancy
or
the
abode
of
the
unsymmetrical
it
is
an
abode
of
fancy
inasmuch
as
it
is
an
ephemeral
structure
built
to
house
a
poetic
impulse
it
is
an
abode
of
vacancy
inasmuch
as
it
is
devoid
of
ornamentation
except
for
what
may
be
placed
in
it
to
satisfy
some
aesthetic
need
of
the
moment
it
is
an
abode
of
the
unsymmetrical
inasmuch
as
it
is
consecrated
to
the
worship
of
the
imperfect
purposely
leaving
some
thing
unfinished
for
the
play
of
the
imagination
to
complete
the
ideals
of
teaism
have
since
the
sixteenth
century
influenced
our
architecture
to
such
degree
that
the
ordinary
japanese
interior
of
the
present
day
on
account
of
the
extreme
simplicity
and
chasteness
of
its
scheme
of
decoration
appears
to
foreigners
almost
barren
the
first
independent
was
the
creation
of
commonly
known
by
his
later
name
of
rikiu
the
greatest
of
all
who
in
the
sixteenth
century
under
the
patronage
of
instituted
and
brought
to
a
high
state
of
perfection
the
formalities
of
the
the
proportions
of

been
previously
determined
by
jowo
a
famous
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
early

merely
of
a
portion
of
the
ordinary

off
by
screens
for
the
purpose
of
the
the
portion
partitioned
off
was
called
the
kakoi
enclosure
a
name
still
applied
to
those
which
are
built
into
a
house
and
are
not
independent
constructions
the
sukiya
consists
of
the
proper

to
accommodate
not
more
than
five
persons
a
number
suggestive
of
the
saying
more
than
the
graces
and
less
than
the
muses
an
anteroom
midsuya
where
the
tea
utensils
are
washed
and
arranged
before
being
brought
in
a
portico
machiai
in
which
the
guests
wait
until
they
receive
the
summons
to
enter
the
and
a
garden
path
the
roji
which
connects
the
machiai
with
the
the
is
unimpressive
in
appearance
it
is
smaller
than
the
smallest
of
japanese
houses
while
the
materials
used
in
its
construction
are
intended
to
give
the
suggestion
of
refined
poverty
yet
we
must
remember
that
all
this
is
the
result
of
profound
artistic
forethought
and
that
the
details
have
been
worked
out
with
care
perhaps
even
greater
than
that
expended
on
the
building
of
the
richest
palaces
and
temples
a
good
is
more
costly
than
an
ordinary
mansion
for
the
selection
of
its
materials
as
well
as
its
workmanship
requires
immense
care
and
precision
indeed
the
carpenters
employed
by
the
form
a
distinct
and
highly
honoured
class
among
artisans
their
work
being
no
less
delicate
than
that
of
the
makers
of
lacquer
cabinets
the
is
not
only
different
from
any
production
of
western
architecture
but
also
contrasts
strongly
with
the
classical
architecture
of
japan
itself
our
ancient
noble
edifices
whether
secular
or
ecclesiastical
were
not
to
be
despised
even
as
regards
their
mere
size
the
few
that
have
been
spared
in
the
disastrous
conflagrations
of
centuries
are
still
capable
of
aweing
us
by
the
grandeur
and
richness
of
their
decoration
huge
pillars
of
wood
from
two
to
three
feet
in
diameter
and
from
thirty
to
forty
feet
high
supported
by
a
complicated
network
of
brackets
the
enormous
beams
which
groaned
under
the
weight
of
the
roofs
the
material
and
mode
of
construction
though
weak
against
fire
proved
itself
strong
against
earthquakes
and
was
well
suited
to
the
climatic
conditions
of
the
country
in
the
golden
hall
of
horiuji
and
the
pagoda
of
yakushiji
we
have
noteworthy
examples
of
the
durability
of
our
wooden
architecture
these
buildings
have
practically
stood
intact
for
nearly
twelve
centuries
the
interior
of
the
old
temples
and
palaces
was
profusely
decorated
in
the
hoodo
temple
at
uji
dating
from
the
tenth
century
we
can
still
see
the
elaborate
canopy
and
gilded
baldachinos
and
inlaid
with
mirrors
and
as
well
as
remains
of
the
paintings
and
sculpture
which
formerly
covered
the
walls
later
at
nikko
and
in
the
nijo
castle
in
kyoto
we
see
structural
beauty
sacrificed
to
a
wealth
of
ornamentation
which
in
colour
and
exquisite
detail
equals
the
utmost
gorgeousness
of
arabian
or
moorish
effort
the
simplicity
and
purism
of
the
resulted
from
emulation
of
the
zen
monastery
a
zen
monastery
differs
from
those
of
other
buddhist
sects
inasmuch
as
it
is
meant
only
to
be
a
dwelling
place
for
the
monks
its
chapel
is
not
a
place
of
worship
or
pilgrimage
but
a
college
room
where
the
students
congregate
for
discussion
and
the
practice
of
meditation
the
room
is
bare
except
for
a
central
alcove
in
which
behind
the
altar
is
a
statue
of
bodhi
dharma
the
founder
of
the
sect
or
of
sakyamuni
attended
by
kashiapa
and
ananda
the
two
earliest
zen
patriarchs
on
the
altar
flowers
and
incense
are
offered
up
in
the
memory
of
the
great
contributions
which
these
sages
made
to
zen
we
have
already
said
that
it
was
the
ritual
instituted
by
the
zen
monks
of
successively
drinking
tea
out
of
a
bowl
before
the
image
of
bodhi
dharma
which
laid
the
foundations
of
the
we
might
add
here
that
the
altar
of
the
zen
chapel
was
the
prototype
of
the
tokonoma
the
place
of
honour
in
a
japanese
room
where
paintings
and
flowers
are
placed
for
the
edification
of
the
guests
all
our
great
were
students
of
zen
and
attempted
to
introduce
the
spirit
of
zennism
into
the
actualities
of
life
thus
the
room
like
the
other
equipments
of
the
reflects
many
of
the
zen
doctrines
the
size
of
the
orthodox
which
is
four
mats
and
a
half
or
ten
feet
square
is
determined
by
a
passage
in
the
sutra
of
vikramadytia
in
that
interesting
work
vikramadytia
welcomes
the
saint
manjushiri
and
thousand
disciples
of
buddha
in
a
room
of
this
size
an
allegory
based
on
the
theory
of
the
of
space
to
the
truly
enlightened
again
the
roji
the
garden
path
which
leads
from
the
machiai
to
the
signified
the
first
stage
of
meditation
the
passage
into
the
roji
was
intended
to
break
connection
with
the
outside
world
and
produce
a
fresh
sensation
conducive
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
aestheticism
in
the
itself
one
who
has
trodden
this
garden
path
can
not
fail
to
remember
how
his
spirit
as
he
walked
in
the
twilight
of
evergreens
over
the
regular
irregularities
of
the
stepping
stones
beneath
which
lay
dried
pine
needles
and
passed
beside
the
granite
lanterns
became
uplifted
above
ordinary
thoughts
one
may
be
in
the
midst
of
a
city
and
yet
feel
as
if
he
were
in
the
forest
far
away
from
the
dust
and
din
of
civilisation
great
was
the
ingenuity
displayed
by
the
in
producing
these
effects
of
serenity
and
purity
the
nature
of
the
sensations
to
be
aroused
in
passing
through
the
roji
differed
with
different
some
like
rikiu
aimed
at
utter
loneliness
and
claimed
the
secret
of
making
a
roji
was
contained
in
the
ancient
ditty
i
look
beyond
flowers
are
not
nor
tinted
leaves
on
the
sea
beach
a
solitary
cottage
stands
in
the
waning
light
of
an
autumn
eve
others
like
sought
for
a
different
effect
enshiu
said
the
idea
of
the
garden
path
was
to
be
found
in
the
following
verses
a
cluster
of
summer
trees
a
bit
of
the
sea
a
pale
evening
moon
it
is
not
difficult
to
gather
his
meaning
he
wished
to
create
the
attitude
of
a
newly
awakened
soul
still
lingering
amid
shadowy
dreams
of
the
past
yet
bathing
in
the
sweet
unconsciousness
of
a
mellow
spiritual
light
and
yearning
for
the
freedom
that
lay
in
the
expanse
beyond
thus
prepared
the
guest
will
silently
approach
the
sanctuary
and
if
a
samurai
will
leave
his
sword
on
the
rack
beneath
the
eaves
the
being
preeminently
the
house
of
peace
then
he
will
bend
low
and
creep
into
the
room
through
a
small
door
not
more
than
three
feet
in
height
this
proceeding
was
incumbent
on
all
guests
high
and
low
alike
and
was
intended
to
inculcate
humility
the
order
of
precedence
having
been
mutually
agreed
upon
while
resting
in
the
machiai
the
guests
one
by
one
will
enter
noiselessly
and
take
their
seats
first
making
obeisance
to
the
picture
or
flower
arrangement
on
the
tokonoma
the
host
will
not
enter
the
room
until
all
the
guests
have
seated
themselves
and
quiet
reigns
with
nothing
to
break
the
silence
save
the
note
of
the
boiling
water
in
the
iron
kettle
the
kettle
sings
well
for
pieces
of
iron
are
so
arranged
in
the
bottom
as
to
produce
a
peculiar
melody
in
which
one
may
hear
the
echoes
of
a
cataract
muffled
by
clouds
of
a
distant
sea
breaking
among
the
rocks
a
rainstorm
sweeping
through
a
bamboo
forest
or
of
the
soughing
of
pines
on
some
faraway
hill
even
in
the
daytime
the
light
in
the
room
is
subdued
for
the
low
eaves
of
the
slanting
roof
admit
but
few
of
the
sun
rays
everything
is
sober
in
tint
from
the
ceiling
to
the
floor
the
guests
themselves
have
carefully
chosen
garments
of
unobtrusive
colors
the
mellowness
of
age
is
over
all
everything
suggestive
of
recent
acquirement
being
tabooed
save
only
the
one
note
of
contrast
furnished
by
the
bamboo
dipper
and
the
linen
napkin
both
immaculately
white
and
new
however
faded
the
and
the
may
seem
everything
is
absolutely
clean
not
a
particle
of
dust
will
be
found
in
the
darkest
corner
for
if
any
exists
the
host
is
not
a
one
of
the
first
requisites
of
a
is
the
knowledge
of
how
to
sweep
clean
and
wash
for
there
is
an
art
in
cleaning
and
dusting
a
piece
of
antique
metal
work
must
not
be
attacked
with
the
unscrupulous
zeal
of
the
dutch
housewife
dripping
water
from
a
flower
vase
need
not
be
wiped
away
for
it
may
be
suggestive
of
dew
and
coolness
in
this
connection
there
is
a
story
of
rikiu
which
well
illustrates
the
ideas
of
cleanliness
entertained
by
the
rikiu
was
watching
his
son
shoan
as
he
swept
and
watered
the
garden
path
not
clean
enough
said
rikiu
when
shoan
had
finished
his
task
and
bade
him
try
again
after
a
weary
hour
the
son
turned
to
rikiu
father
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
the
steps
have
been
washed
for
the
third
time
the
stone
lanterns
and
the
trees
are
well
sprinkled
with
water
moss
and
lichens
are
shining
with
a
fresh
verdure
not
a
twig
not
a
leaf
have
i
left
on
the
ground
young
fool
chided
the
that
is
not
the
way
a
garden
path
should
be
swept
saying
this
rikiu
stepped
into
the
garden
shook
a
tree
and
scattered
over
the
garden
gold
and
crimson
leaves
scraps
of
the
brocade
of
autumn
what
rikiu
demanded
was
not
cleanliness
alone
but
the
beautiful
and
the
natural
also
the
name
abode
of
fancy
implies
a
structure
created
to
meet
some
individual
artistic
requirement
the
is
made
for
the
tea
master
not
the
for
the
it
is
not
intended
for
posterity
and
is
therefore
ephemeral
the
idea
that
everyone
should
have
a
house
of
his
own
is
based
on
an
ancient
custom
of
the
japanese
race
shinto
superstition
ordaining
that
every
dwelling
should
be
evacuated
on
the
death
of
its
chief
occupant
perhaps
there
may
have
been
some
unrealized
sanitary
reason
for
this
practice
another
early
custom
was
that
a
newly
built
house
should
be
provided
for
each
couple
that
married
it
is
on
account
of
such
customs
that
we
find
the
imperial
capitals
so
frequently
removed
from
one
site
to
another
in
ancient
days
the
rebuilding
every
twenty
years
of
ise
temple
the
supreme
shrine
of
the
is
an
example
of
one
of
these
ancient
rites
which
still
obtain
at
the
present
day
the
observance
of
these
customs
was
only
possible
with
some
form
of
construction
as
that
furnished
by
our
system
of
wooden
architecture
easily
pulled
down
easily
built
up
a
more
lasting
style
employing
brick
and
stone
would
have
rendered
migrations
impracticable
as
indeed
they
became
when
the
more
stable
and
massive
wooden
construction
of
china
was
adopted
by
us
after
the
nara
period
with
the
predominance
of
zen
individualism
in
the
fifteenth
century
however
the
old
idea
became
imbued
with
a
deeper
significance
as
conceived
in
connection
with
the
zennism
with
the
buddhist
theory
of
evanescence
and
its
demands
for
the
mastery
of
spirit
over
matter
recognized
the
house
only
as
a
temporary
refuge
for
the
body
the
body
itself
was
but
as
a
hut
in
the
wilderness
a
flimsy
shelter
made
by
tying
together
the
grasses
that
grew
around
when
these
ceased
to
be
bound
together
they
again
became
resolved
into
the
original
waste
in
the
fugitiveness
is
suggested
in
the
thatched
roof
frailty
in
the
slender
pillars
lightness
in
the
bamboo
support
apparent
carelessness
in
the
use
of
commonplace
materials
the
eternal
is
to
be
found
only
in
the
spirit
which
embodied
in
these
simple
surroundings
beautifies
them
with
the
subtle
light
of
its
refinement
that
the
should
be
built
to
suit
some
individual
taste
is
an
enforcement
of
the
principle
of
vitality
in
art
art
to
be
fully
appreciated
must
be
true
to
contemporaneous
life
it
is
not
that
we
should
ignore
the
claims
of
posterity
but
that
we
should
seek
to
enjoy
the
present
more
it
is
not
that
we
should
disregard
the
creations
of
the
past
but
that
we
should
try
to
assimilate
them
into
our
consciousness
slavish
conformity
to
traditions
and
formulas
fetters
the
expression
of
individuality
in
architecture
we
can
but
weep
over
the
senseless
imitations
of
european
buildings
which
one
beholds
in
modern
japan
we
marvel
why
among
the
most
progressive
western
nations
architecture
should
be
so
devoid
of
originality
so
replete
with
repetitions
of
obsolete
styles
perhaps
we
are
passing
through
an
age
of
democratisation
in
art
while
awaiting
the
rise
of
some
princely
master
who
shall
establish
a
new
dynasty
would
that
we
loved
the
ancients
more
and
copied
them
less
it
has
been
said
that
the
greeks
were
great
because
they
never
drew
from
the
antique
the
term
abode
of
vacancy
besides
conveying
the
taoist
theory
of
the
involves
the
conception
of
a
continued
need
of
change
in
decorative
motives
the
is
absolutely
empty
except
for
what
may
be
placed
there
temporarily
to
satisfy
some
aesthetic
mood
some
special
art
object
is
brought
in
for
the
occasion
and
everything
else
is
selected
and
arranged
to
enhance
the
beauty
of
the
principal
theme
one
can
not
listen
to
different
pieces
of
music
at
the
same
time
a
real
comprehension
of
the
beautiful
being
possible
only
through
concentration
upon
some
central
motive
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
the
system
of
decoration
in
our
is
opposed
to
that
which
obtains
in
the
west
where
the
interior
of
a
house
is
often
converted
into
a
museum
to
a
japanese
accustomed
to
simplicity
of
ornamentation
and
frequent
change
of
decorative
method
a
western
interior
permanently
filled
with
a
vast
array
of
pictures
statuary
and
gives
the
impression
of
mere
vulgar
display
of
riches
it
calls
for
a
mighty
wealth
of
appreciation
to
enjoy
the
constant
sight
of
even
a
masterpiece
and
limitless
indeed
must
be
the
capacity
for
artistic
feeling
in
those
who
can
exist
day
after
day
in
the
midst
of
such
confusion
of
color
and
form
as
is
to
be
often
seen
in
the
homes
of
europe
and
america
the
abode
of
the
unsymmetrical
suggests
another
phase
of
our
decorative
scheme
the
absence
of
symmetry
in
japanese
art
objects
has
been
often
commented
on
by
western
critics
this
also
is
a
result
of
a
working
out
through
zennism
of
taoist
ideals
confucianism
with
its
idea
of
dualism
and
northern
buddhism
with
its
worship
of
a
trinity
were
in
no
way
opposed
to
the
expression
of
symmetry
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
we
study
the
ancient
bronzes
of
china
or
the
religious
arts
of
the
tang
dynasty
and
the
nara
period
we
shall
recognize
a
constant
striving
after
symmetry
the
decoration
of
our
classical
interiors
was
decidedly
regular
in
its
arrangement
the
taoist
and
zen
conception
of
perfection
however
was
different
the
dynamic
nature
of
their
philosophy
laid
more
stress
upon
the
process
through
which
perfection
was
sought
than
upon
perfection
itself
true
beauty
could
be
discovered
only
by
one
who
mentally
completed
the
incomplete
the
virility
of
life
and
art
lay
in
its
possibilities
for
growth
in
the
it
is
left
for
each
guest
in
imagination
to
complete
the
total
effect
in
relation
to
himself
since
zennism
has
become
the
prevailing
mode
of
thought
the
art
of
the
extreme
orient
has
purposefully
avoided
the
symmetrical
as
expressing
not
only
completion
but
repetition
uniformity
of
design
was
considered
fatal
to
the
freshness
of
imagination
thus
landscapes
birds
and
flowers
became
the
favorite
subjects
for
depiction
rather
than
the
human
figure
the
latter
being
present
in
the
person
of
the
beholder
himself
we
are
often
too
much
in
evidence
as
it
is
and
in
spite
of
our
vanity
even
is
apt
to
become
monotonous
in
the
the
fear
of
repetition
is
a
constant
presence
the
various
objects
for
the
decoration
of
a
room
should
be
so
selected
that
no
colour
or
design
shall
be
repeated
if
you
have
a
living
flower
a
painting
of
flowers
is
not
allowable
if
you
are
using
a
round
kettle
the
water
pitcher
should
be
angular
a
cup
with
a
black
glaze
should
not
be
associated
with
a
of
black
lacquer
in
placing
a
vase
of
an
incense
burner
on
the
tokonoma
care
should
be
taken
not
to
put
it
in
the
exact
centre
lest
it
divide
the
space
into
equal
halves
the
pillar
of
the
tokonoma
should
be
of
a
different
kind
of
wood
from
the
other
pillars
in
order
to
break
any
suggestion
of
monotony
in
the
room
here
again
the
japanese
method
of
interior
decoration
differs
from
that
of
the
occident
where
we
see
objects
arrayed
symmetrically
on
mantelpieces
and
elsewhere
in
western
houses
we
are
often
confronted
with
what
appears
to
us
useless
reiteration
we
find
it
trying
to
talk
to
a
man
while
his
portrait
stares
at
us
from
behind
his
back
we
wonder
which
is
real
he
of
the
picture
or
he
who
talks
and
feel
a
curious
conviction
that
one
of
them
must
be
fraud
many
a
time
have
we
sat
at
a
festive
board
contemplating
with
a
secret
shock
to
our
digestion
the
representation
of
abundance
on
the
walls
why
these
pictured
victims
of
chase
and
sport
the
elaborate
carvings
of
fishes
and
fruit
why
the
display
of
family
plates
reminding
us
of
those
who
have
dined
and
are
dead
the
simplicity
of
the
and
its
freedom
from
vulgarity
make
it
truly
a
sanctuary
from
the
vexations
of
the
outer
world
there
and
there
alone
one
can
consecrate
himself
to
undisturbed
adoration
of
the
beautiful
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
afforded
a
welcome
respite
from
labour
to
the
fierce
warriors
and
statesmen
engaged
in
the
unification
and
reconstruction
of
japan
in
the
seventeenth
century
after
the
strict
formalism
of
the
tokugawa
rule
had
been
developed
it
offered
the
only
opportunity
possible
for
the
free
communion
of
artistic
spirits
before
a
great
work
of
art
there
was
no
distinction
between
daimyo
samurai
and
commoner
nowadays
industrialism
is
making
true
refinement
more
and
more
difficult
all
the
world
over
do
we
not
need
the
more
than
ever
art
appreciation
have
you
heard
the
taoist
tale
of
the
taming
of
the
harp
once
in
the
hoary
ages
in
the
ravine
of
lungmen
stood
a
kiri
tree
a
veritable
king
of
the
forest
it
reared
its
head
to
talk
to
the
stars
its
roots
struck
deep
into
the
earth
mingling
their
bronzed
coils
with
those
of
the
silver
dragon
that
slept
beneath
and
it
came
to
pass
that
a
mighty
wizard
made
of
this
tree
a
wondrous
harp
whose
stubborn
spirit
should
be
tamed
but
by
the
greatest
of
musicians
for
long
the
instrument
was
treasured
by
the
emperor
of
china
but
all
in
vain
were
the
efforts
of
those
who
in
turn
tried
to
draw
melody
from
its
strings
in
response
to
their
utmost
strivings
there
came
from
the
harp
but
harsh
notes
of
disdain
with
the
songs
they
fain
would
sing
the
harp
refused
to
recognise
a
master
at
last
came
peiwoh
the
prince
of
harpists
with
tender
hand
he
caressed
the
harp
as
one
might
seek
to
soothe
an
unruly
horse
and
softly
touched
the
chords
he
sang
of
nature
and
the
seasons
of
high
mountains
and
flowing
waters
and
all
the
memories
of
the
tree
awoke
once
more
the
sweet
breath
of
spring
played
amidst
its
branches
the
young
cataracts
as
they
danced
down
the
ravine
laughed
to
the
budding
flowers
anon
were
heard
the
dreamy
voices
of
summer
with
its
myriad
insects
the
gentle
pattering
of
rain
the
wail
of
the
cuckoo
hark
a
tiger
roars
the
valley
answers
again
it
is
autumn
in
the
desert
night
sharp
like
a
sword
gleams
the
moon
upon
the
frosted
grass
now
winter
reigns
and
through
the
air
swirl
flocks
of
swans
and
rattling
hailstones
beat
upon
the
boughs
with
fierce
delight
then
peiwoh
changed
the
key
and
sang
of
love
the
forest
swayed
like
an
ardent
swain
deep
lost
in
thought
on
high
like
a
haughty
maiden
swept
a
cloud
bright
and
fair
but
passing
trailed
long
shadows
on
the
ground
black
like
despair
again
the
mode
was
changed
peiwoh
sang
of
war
of
clashing
steel
and
trampling
steeds
and
in
the
harp
arose
the
tempest
of
lungmen
the
dragon
rode
the
lightning
the
thundering
avalanche
crashed
through
the
hills
in
ecstasy
the
celestial
monarch
asked
peiwoh
wherein
lay
the
secret
of
his
victory
sire
he
replied
others
have
failed
because
they
sang
but
of
themselves
i
left
the
harp
to
choose
its
theme
and
knew
not
truly
whether
the
harp
had
been
peiwoh
or
peiwoh
were
the
harp
this
story
well
illustrates
the
mystery
of
art
appreciation
the
masterpiece
is
a
symphony
played
upon
our
finest
feelings
true
art
is
peiwoh
and
we
the
harp
of
lungmen
at
the
magic
touch
of
the
beautiful
the
secret
chords
of
our
being
are
awakened
we
vibrate
and
thrill
in
response
to
its
call
mind
speaks
to
mind
we
listen
to
the
unspoken
we
gaze
upon
the
unseen
the
master
calls
forth
notes
we
know
not
of
memories
long
forgotten
all
come
back
to
us
with
a
new
significance
hopes
stifled
by
fear
yearnings
that
we
dare
not
recognise
stand
forth
in
new
glory
our
mind
is
the
canvas
on
which
the
artists
lay
their
colour
their
pigments
are
our
emotions
their
chiaroscuro
the
light
of
joy
the
shadow
of
sadness
the
masterpiece
is
of
ourselves
as
we
are
of
the
masterpiece
the
sympathetic
communion
of
minds
necessary
for
art
appreciation
must
be
based
on
mutual
concession
the
spectator
must
cultivate
the
proper
attitude
for
receiving
the
message
as
the
artist
must
know
how
to
impart
it
the
himself
a
daimyo
has
left
to
us
these
memorable
words
approach
a
great
painting
as
thou
wouldst
approach
a
great
prince
in
order
to
understand
a
masterpiece
you
must
lay
yourself
low
before
it
and
await
with
bated
breath
its
least
utterance
an
eminent
sung
critic
once
made
a
charming
confession
said
he
in
my
young
days
i
praised
the
master
whose
pictures
i
liked
but
as
my
judgement
matured
i
praised
myself
for
liking
what
the
masters
had
chosen
to
have
me
like
it
is
to
be
deplored
that
so
few
of
us
really
take
pains
to
study
the
moods
of
the
masters
in
our
stubborn
ignorance
we
refuse
to
render
them
this
simple
courtesy
and
thus
often
miss
the
rich
repast
of
beauty
spread
before
our
very
eyes
a
master
has
always
something
to
offer
while
we
go
hungry
solely
because
of
our
own
lack
of
appreciation
to
the
sympathetic
a
masterpiece
becomes
a
living
reality
towards
which
we
feel
drawn
in
bonds
of
comradeship
the
masters
are
immortal
for
their
loves
and
fears
live
in
us
over
and
over
again
it
is
rather
the
soul
than
the
hand
the
man
than
the
technique
which
appeals
to
us
the
more
human
the
call
the
deeper
is
our
response
it
is
because
of
this
secret
understanding
between
the
master
and
ourselves
that
in
poetry
or
romance
we
suffer
and
rejoice
with
the
hero
and
heroine
chikamatsu
our
japanese
shakespeare
has
laid
down
as
one
of
the
first
principles
of
dramatic
composition
the
importance
of
taking
the
audience
into
the
confidence
of
the
author
several
of
his
pupils
submitted
plays
for
his
approval
but
only
one
of
the
pieces
appealed
to
him
it
was
a
play
somewhat
resembling
the
comedy
of
errors
in
which
twin
brethren
suffer
through
mistaken
identity
this
said
chikamatsu
has
the
proper
spirit
of
the
drama
for
it
takes
the
audience
into
consideration
the
public
is
permitted
to
know
more
than
the
actors
it
knows
where
the
mistake
lies
and
pities
the
poor
figures
on
the
board
who
innocently
rush
to
their
fate
the
great
masters
both
of
the
east
and
the
west
never
forgot
the
value
of
suggestion
as
a
means
for
taking
the
spectator
into
their
confidence
who
can
contemplate
a
masterpiece
without
being
awed
by
the
immense
vista
of
thought
presented
to
our
consideration
how
familiar
and
sympathetic
are
they
all
how
cold
in
contrast
the
modern
commonplaces
in
the
former
we
feel
the
warm
outpouring
of
a
man
heart
in
the
latter
only
a
formal
salute
engrossed
in
his
technique
the
modern
rarely
rises
above
himself
like
the
musicians
who
vainly
invoked
the
lungmen
harp
he
sings
only
of
himself
his
works
may
be
nearer
science
but
are
further
from
humanity
we
have
an
old
saying
in
japan
that
a
woman
can
not
love
a
man
who
is
truly
vain
for
their
is
no
crevice
in
his
heart
for
love
to
enter
and
fill
up
in
art
vanity
is
equally
fatal
to
sympathetic
feeling
whether
on
the
part
of
the
artist
or
the
public
nothing
is
more
hallowing
than
the
union
of
kindred
spirits
in
art
at
the
moment
of
meeting
the
art
lover
transcends
himself
at
once
he
is
and
is
not
he
catches
a
glimpse
of
infinity
but
words
can
not
voice
his
delight
for
the
eye
has
no
tongue
freed
from
the
fetters
of
matter
his
spirit
moves
in
the
rhythm
of
things
it
is
thus
that
art
becomes
akin
to
religion
and
ennobles
mankind
it
is
this
which
makes
a
masterpiece
something
sacred
in
the
old
days
the
veneration
in
which
the
japanese
held
the
work
of
the
great
artist
was
intense
the
guarded
their
treasures
with
religious
secrecy
and
it
was
often
necessary
to
open
a
whole
series
of
boxes
one
within
another
before
reaching
the
shrine
itself
the
silken
wrapping
within
whose
soft
folds
lay
the
holy
of
holies
rarely
was
the
object
exposed
to
view
and
then
only
to
the
initiated
at
the
time
when
teaism
was
in
the
ascendency
the
taiko
generals
would
be
better
satisfied
with
the
present
of
a
rare
work
of
art
than
a
large
grant
of
territory
as
a
reward
of
victory
many
of
our
favourite
dramas
are
based
on
the
loss
and
recovery
of
a
noted
masterpiece
for
instance
in
one
play
the
palace
of
lord
hosokawa
in
which
was
preserved
the
celebrated
painting
of
dharuma
by
sesson
suddenly
takes
fire
through
the
negligence
of
the
samurai
in
charge
resolved
at
all
hazards
to
rescue
the
precious
painting
he
rushes
into
the
burning
building
and
seizes
the
kakemono
only
to
find
all
means
of
exit
cut
off
by
the
flames
thinking
only
of
the
picture
he
slashes
open
his
body
with
his
sword
wraps
his
torn
sleeve
about
the
sesson
and
plunges
it
into
the
gaping
wound
the
fire
is
at
last
extinguished
among
the
smoking
embers
is
found
a
corpse
within
which
reposes
the
treasure
uninjured
by
the
fire
horrible
as
such
tales
are
they
illustrate
the
great
value
that
we
set
upon
a
masterpiece
as
well
as
the
devotion
of
a
trusted
samurai
we
must
remember
however
that
art
is
of
value
only
to
the
extent
that
it
speaks
to
us
it
might
be
a
universal
language
if
we
ourselves
were
universal
in
our
sympathies
our
finite
nature
the
power
of
tradition
and
conventionality
as
well
as
our
hereditary
instincts
restrict
the
scope
of
our
capacity
for
artistic
enjoyment
our
very
individuality
establishes
in
one
sense
a
limit
to
our
understanding
and
our
aesthetic
personality
seeks
its
own
affinities
in
the
creations
of
the
past
it
is
true
that
with
cultivation
our
sense
of
art
appreciation
broadens
and
we
become
able
to
enjoy
many
hitherto
unrecognised
expressions
of
beauty
but
after
all
we
see
only
our
own
image
in
the
universe
our
particular
idiosyncracies
dictate
the
mode
of
our
perceptions
the
collected
only
objects
which
fell
strictly
within
the
measure
of
their
individual
appreciation
one
is
reminded
in
this
connection
of
a
story
concerning
enshiu
was
complimented
by
his
disciples
on
the
admirable
taste
he
had
displayed
in
the
choice
of
his
collection
said
they
each
piece
is
such
that
no
one
could
help
admiring
it
shows
that
you
had
better
taste
than
had
rikiu
for
his
collection
could
only
be
appreciated
by
one
beholder
in
a
thousand
sorrowfully
enshiu
replied
this
only
proves
how
commonplace
i
am
the
great
rikiu
dared
to
love
only
those
objects
which
personally
appealed
to
him
whereas
i
unconsciously
cater
to
the
taste
of
the
majority
verily
rikiu
was
one
in
a
thousand
among
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
so
much
of
the
apparent
enthusiasm
for
art
at
the
present
day
has
no
foundation
in
real
feeling
in
this
democratic
age
of
ours
men
clamour
for
what
is
popularly
considered
the
best
regardless
of
their
feelings
they
want
the
costly
not
the
refined
the
fashionable
not
the
beautiful
to
the
masses
contemplation
of
illustrated
periodicals
the
worthy
product
of
their
own
industrialism
would
give
more
digestible
food
for
artistic
enjoyment
than
the
early
italians
or
the
ashikaga
masters
whom
they
pretend
to
admire
the
name
of
the
artist
is
more
important
to
them
than
the
quality
of
the
work
as
a
chinese
critic
complained
many
centuries
ago
people
criticise
a
picture
by
their
ear
it
is
this
lack
of
genuine
appreciation
that
is
responsible
for
the
horrors
that
greet
us
wherever
we
turn
another
common
mistake
is
that
of
confusing
art
with
archaeology
the
veneration
born
of
antiquity
is
one
of
the
best
traits
in
the
human
character
and
fain
would
we
have
it
cultivated
to
a
greater
extent
the
old
masters
are
rightly
to
be
honoured
for
opening
the
path
to
future
enlightenment
the
mere
fact
that
they
have
passed
unscathed
through
centuries
of
criticism
and
come
down
to
us
still
covered
with
glory
commands
our
respect
but
we
should
be
foolish
indeed
if
we
valued
their
achievement
simply
on
the
score
of
age
yet
we
allow
our
historical
sympathy
to
override
our
aesthetic
discrimination
we
offer
flowers
of
approbation
when
the
artist
is
safely
laid
in
his
grave
the
nineteenth
century
pregnant
with
the
theory
of
evolution
has
moreover
created
in
us
the
habit
of
losing
sight
of
the
individual
in
the
species
a
collector
is
anxious
to
acquire
specimens
to
illustrate
a
period
or
a
school
and
forgets
that
a
single
masterpiece
can
teach
us
more
than
any
number
of
the
mediocre
products
of
a
given
period
or
school
we
classify
too
much
and
enjoy
too
little
the
sacrifice
of
the
aesthetic
to
the
scientific
method
of
exhibition
has
been
the
bane
of
many
museums
the
claims
of
contemporary
art
can
not
be
ignored
in
any
vital
scheme
of
life
the
art
of
is
that
which
really
belongs
to
us
it
is
our
own
reflection
in
condemning
it
we
but
condemn
ourselves
we
say
that
the
present
age
possesses
no
art
who
is
responsible
for
this
it
is
indeed
a
shame
that
despite
all
our
rhapsodies
about
the
ancients
we
pay
so
little
attention
to
our
own
possibilities
struggling
artists
weary
souls
lingering
in
the
shadow
of
cold
disdain
in
our
century
what
inspiration
do
we
offer
them
the
past
may
well
look
with
pity
at
the
poverty
of
our
civilisation
the
future
will
laugh
at
the
barrenness
of
our
art
we
are
destroying
the
beautiful
in
life
would
that
some
great
wizard
might
from
the
stem
of
society
shape
a
mighty
harp
whose
strings
would
resound
to
the
touch
of
genius
vi
flowers
in
the
trembling
grey
of
a
spring
dawn
when
the
birds
were
whispering
in
mysterious
cadence
among
the
trees
have
you
not
felt
that
they
were
talking
to
their
mates
about
the
flowers
surely
with
mankind
the
appreciation
of
flowers
must
have
been
coeval
with
the
poetry
of
love
where
better
than
in
a
flower
sweet
in
its
unconsciousness
fragrant
because
of
its
silence
can
we
image
the
unfolding
of
a
virgin
soul
the
primeval
man
in
offering
the
first
garland
to
his
maiden
thereby
transcended
the
brute
he
became
human
in
thus
rising
above
the
crude
necessities
of
nature
he
entered
the
realm
of
art
when
he
perceived
the
subtle
use
of
the
useless
in
joy
or
sadness
flowers
are
our
constant
friends
we
eat
drink
sing
dance
and
flirt
with
them
we
wed
and
christen
with
flowers
we
dare
not
die
without
them
we
have
worshipped
with
the
lily
we
have
meditated
with
the
lotus
we
have
charged
in
battle
array
with
the
rose
and
the
chrysanthemum
we
have
even
attempted
to
speak
in
the
language
of
flowers
how
could
we
live
without
them
it
frightens
one
to
conceive
of
a
world
bereft
of
their
presence
what
solace
do
they
not
bring
to
the
bedside
of
the
sick
what
a
light
of
bliss
to
the
darkness
of
weary
spirits
their
serene
tenderness
restores
to
us
our
waning
confidence
in
the
universe
even
as
the
intent
gaze
of
a
beautiful
child
recalls
our
lost
hopes
when
we
are
laid
low
in
the
dust
it
is
they
who
linger
in
sorrow
over
our
graves
sad
as
it
is
we
can
not
conceal
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
our
companionship
with
flowers
we
have
not
risen
very
far
above
the
brute
scratch
the
sheepskin
and
the
wolf
within
us
will
soon
show
his
teeth
it
has
been
said
that
a
man
at
ten
is
an
animal
at
twenty
a
lunatic
at
thirty
a
failure
at
forty
a
fraud
and
at
fifty
a
criminal
perhaps
he
becomes
a
criminal
because
he
has
never
ceased
to
be
an
animal
nothing
is
real
to
us
but
hunger
nothing
sacred
except
our
own
desires
shrine
after
shrine
has
crumbled
before
our
eyes
but
one
altar
is
forever
preserved
that
whereon
we
burn
incense
to
the
supreme
idol
ourselves
our
god
is
great
and
money
is
his
prophet
we
devastate
nature
in
order
to
make
sacrifice
to
him
we
boast
that
we
have
conquered
matter
and
forget
that
it
is
matter
that
has
enslaved
us
what
atrocities
do
we
not
perpetrate
in
the
name
of
culture
and
refinement
tell
me
gentle
flowers
teardrops
of
the
stars
standing
in
the
garden
nodding
your
heads
to
the
bees
as
they
sing
of
the
dews
and
the
sunbeams
are
you
aware
of
the
fearful
doom
that
awaits
you
dream
on
sway
and
frolic
while
you
may
in
the
gentle
breezes
of
summer
a
ruthless
hand
will
close
around
your
throats
you
will
be
wrenched
torn
asunder
limb
by

and
borne
away
from
your
quiet
homes
the
wretch

may
be
passing
fair
she
may
say
how
lovely
you
are
while
her
fingers
are
still
moist
with
your
blood
tell
me
will
this
be
kindness
it
may
be
your
fate
to
be
imprisoned
in
the
hair
of
one
whom
you
know
to
be
heartless
or
to
be
thrust
into
the
buttonhole
of
one
who
would
not
dare
to
look
you
in
the
face
were
you
a
man
it
may
even
be
your
lot
to
be
confined
in
some
narrow
vessel
with
only
stagnant
water
to
quench
the
maddening
thirst
that
warns
of
ebbing
life
flowers
if
you
were
in
the
land
of
the
mikado
you
might
some
time
meet
a
dread
personage
armed
with
scissors
and
a
tiny
saw
he
would
call
himself
a
master
of
flowers
he
would
claim
the
rights
of
a
doctor
and
you
would
instinctively
hate
him
for
you
know
a
doctor
always
seeks
to
prolong
the
troubles
of
his
victims
he
would
cut
bend
and
twist
you
into
those
impossible
positions
which
he
thinks
it
proper
that
you
should
assume
he
would
contort
your
muscles
and
dislocate
your
bones
like
any
osteopath
he
would
burn
you
with
coals
to
stop
your
bleeding
and
thrust
wires
into
you
to
assist
your
circulation
he
would
diet
you
with
salt
vinegar
alum
and
sometimes
vitriol
boiling
water
would
be
poured
on
your
feet
when
you
seemed
ready
to
faint
it
would
be
his
boast
that
he
could
keep
life
within
you
for
two
or
more
weeks
longer
than
would
have
been
possible
without
his
treatment
would
you
not
have
preferred
to
have
been
killed
at
once
when
you
were
first
captured
what
were
the
crimes
you
must
have
committed
during
your
past
incarnation
to
warrant
such
punishment
in
this
the
wanton
waste
of
flowers
among
western
communities
is
even
more
appalling
than
the
way
they
are
treated
by
eastern
flower
masters
the
number
of
flowers
cut
daily
to
adorn
the
ballrooms
and
of
europe
and
america
to
be
thrown
away
on
the
morrow
must
be
something
enormous
if
strung
together
they
might
garland
a
continent
beside
this
utter
carelessness
of
life
the
guilt
of
the
becomes
insignificant
he
at
least
respects
the
economy
of
nature
selects
his
victims
with
careful
foresight
and
after
death
does
honour
to
their
remains
in
the
west
the
display
of
flowers
seems
to
be
a
part
of
the
pageantry
of
wealth
the
fancy
of
a
moment
whither
do
they
all
go
these
flowers
when
the
revelry
is
over
nothing
is
more
pitiful
than
to
see
a
faded
flower
remorselessly
flung
upon
a
dung
heap
why
were
the
flowers
born
so
beautiful
and
yet
so
hapless
insects
can
sting
and
even
the
meekest
of
beasts
will
fight
when
brought
to
bay
the
birds
whose
plumage
is
sought
to
deck
some
bonnet
can
fly
from
its
pursuer
the
furred
animal
whose
coat
you
covet
for
your
own
may
hide
at
your
approach
alas
the
only
flower
known
to
have
wings
is
the
butterfly
all
others
stand
helpless
before
the
destroyer
if
they
shriek
in
their
death
agony
their
cry
never
reaches
our
hardened
ears
we
are
ever
brutal
to
those
who
love
and
serve
us
in
silence
but
the
time
may
come
when
for
our
cruelty
we
shall
be
deserted
by
these
best
friends
of
ours
have
you
not
noticed
that
the
wild
flowers
are
becoming
scarcer
every
year
it
may
be
that
their
wise
men
have
told
them
to
depart
till
man
becomes
more
human
perhaps
they
have
migrated
to
heaven
much
may
be
said
in
favor
of
him
who
cultivates
plants
the
man
of
the
pot
is
far
more
humane
than
he
of
the
scissors
we
watch
with
delight
his
concern
about
water
and
sunshine
his
feuds
with
parasites
his
horror
of
frosts
his
anxiety
when
the
buds
come
slowly
his
rapture
when
the
leaves
attain
their
lustre
in
the
east
the
art
of
floriculture
is
a
very
ancient
one
and
the
loves
of
a
poet
and
his
favorite
plant
have
often
been
recorded
in
story
and
song
with
the
development
of
ceramics
during
the
tang
and
sung
dynasties
we
hear
of
wonderful
receptacles
made
to
hold
plants
not
pots
but
jewelled
palaces
a
special
attendant
was
detailed
to
wait
upon
each
flower
and
to
wash
its
leaves
with
soft
brushes
made
of
rabbit
hair
it
has
been
written
pingtse
by
yuenchunlang
that
the
peony
should
be
bathed
by
a
handsome
maiden
in
full
costume
that
a
should
be
watered
by
a
pale
slender
monk
in
japan
one
of
the
most
popular
of
the
the
hachinoki
composed
during
the
ashikaga
period
is
based
upon
the
story
of
an
impoverished
knight
who
on
a
freezing
night
in
lack
of
fuel
for
a
fire
cuts
his
cherished
plants
in
order
to
entertain
a
wandering
friar
the
friar
is
in
reality
no
other
than
the
of
our
tales
and
the
sacrifice
is
not
without
its
reward
this
opera
never
fails
to
draw
tears
from
a
tokio
audience
even
great
precautions
were
taken
for
the
preservation
of
delicate
blossoms
emperor
huensung
of
the
tang
dynasty
hung
tiny
golden
bells
on
the
branches
in
his
garden
to
keep
off
the
birds
he
it
was
who
went
off
in
the
springtime
with
his
court
musicians
to
gladden
the
flowers
with
soft
music
a
quaint
tablet
which
tradition
ascribes
to
yoshitsune
the
hero
of
our
arthurian
legends
is
still
extant
in
one
of
the
japanese
monasteries
sumadera
near
kobe
it
is
a
notice
put
up
for
the
protection
of
a
certain
wonderful
and
appeals
to
us
with
the
grim
humour
of
a
warlike
age
after
referring
to
the
beauty
of
the
blossoms
the
inscription
says
whoever
cuts
a
single
branch
of
this
tree
shall
forfeit
a
finger
therefor
would
that
such
laws
could
be
enforced
nowadays
against
those
who
wantonly
destroy
flowers
and
mutilate
objects
of
art
yet
even
in
the
case
of
pot
flowers
we
are
inclined
to
suspect
the
selfishness
of
man
why
take
the
plants
from
their
homes
and
ask
them
to
bloom
mid
strange
surroundings
is
it
not
like
asking
the
birds
to
sing
and
mate
cooped
up
in
cages
who
knows
but
that
the
orchids
feel
stifled
by
the
artificial
heat
in
your
conservatories
and
hopelessly
long
for
a
glimpse
of
their
own
southern
skies
the
ideal
lover
of
flowers
is
he
who
visits
them
in
their
native
haunts
like
taoyuenming
all
celebrated
chinese
poets
and
philosophers
who
sat
before
a
broken
bamboo
fence
in
converse
with
the
wild
chrysanthemum
or
linwosing
losing
himself
amid
mysterious
fragrance
as
he
wandered
in
the
twilight
among
the
of
the
western
lake
is
said
that
chowmushih
slept
in
a
boat
so
that
his
dreams
might
mingle
with
those
of
the
lotus
it
was
the
same
spirit
which
moved
the
empress
komio
one
of
our
most
renowned
nara
sovereigns
as
she
sang
if
i
pluck
thee
my

defile

let
us
not
be
too
sentimental
let
us
be
less
luxurious
but
more
magnificent

one
of

the

of

through
the
disintegration
of
the

we
have
worshipped
death
the
relentless
goddess
of

under
many
different
names
it
was
the
shadow
of
the
that
the
gheburs

the
icy

the

hope
out
of
the

a
higher
realisation
of
manhood
why
not
destroy
flowers
if
thereby
we
can
evolve
new
forms
ennobling
the

idea
we
only
ask
them
to
join
in
our
sacrifice
to
the
beautiful
we
shall
atone
for
the
deed
by
consecrating
ourselves
to
purity
and
simplicity
thus
reasoned
the
when
they
established
the
cult
of
flowers
anyone
acquainted
with
the
ways
of
our
and
must
have
noticed
the
religious
veneration
with
which
they
regard
flowers
they
do
not
cull
at
random
but
carefully
select
each
branch
or
spray
with
an
eye
to
the
artistic
composition
they
have
in
mind
they
would
be
ashamed
should
they
chance
to
cut
more
than
were
absolutely
necessary
it
may
be
remarked
in
this
connection
that
they
always
associate
the
leaves
if
there
be
any
with
the
flower
for
the
object
is
to
present
the
whole
beauty
of
plant
life
in
this
respect
as
in
many
others
their
method
differs
from
that
pursued
in
western
countries
here
we
are
apt
to
see
only
the
flower
stems
heads
as
it
were
without
body
stuck
promiscuously
into
a
vase
when
a
has
arranged
a
flower
to
his
satisfaction
he
will
place
it
on
the
tokonoma
the
place
of
honour
in
a
japanese
room
nothing
else
will
be
placed
near
it
which
might
interfere
with
its
effect
not
even
a
painting
unless
there
be
some
special
aesthetic
reason
for
the
combination
it
rests
there
like
an
enthroned
prince
and
the
guests
or
disciples
on
entering
the
room
will
salute
it
with
a
profound
bow
before
making
their
addresses
to
the
host
drawings
from
masterpieces
are
made
and
published
for
the
edification
of
amateurs
the
amount
of
literature
on
the
subject
is
quite
voluminous
when
the
flower
fades
the
master
tenderly
consigns
it
to
the
river
or
carefully
buries
it
in
the
ground
monuments
are
sometimes
erected
to
their
memory
the
birth
of
the
art
of
flower
arrangement
seems
to
be
simultaneous
with
that
of
teaism
in
the
fifteenth
century
our
legends
ascribe
the
first
flower
arrangement
to
those
early
buddhist
saints
who
gathered
the
flowers
strewn
by
the
storm
and
in
their
infinite
solicitude
for
all
living
things
placed
them
in
vessels
of
water
it
is
said
that
soami
the
great
painter
and
connoisseur
of
the
court
of
was
one
of
the
earliest
adepts
at
it
juko
the
was
one
of
his
pupils
as
was
also
senno
the
founder
of
the
house
of
ikenobo
a
family
as
illustrious
in
the
annals
of
flowers
as
was
that
of
the
kanos
in
painting
with
the
perfecting
of
the
under
rikiu
in
the
latter
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
flower
arrangement
also
attains
its
full
growth
rikiu
and
his
successors
the
celebrated
koyetsu
vied
with
each
other
in
forming
new
combinations
we
must
remember
however
that
the
of
the
formed
only
a
part
of
their
aesthetic
ritual
and
was
not
a
distinct
religion
by
itself
a
flower
arrangement
like
the
other
works
of
art
in
the
was
subordinated
to
the
total
scheme
of
decoration
thus
sekishiu
ordained
that
white
plum
blossoms
should
not
be
made
use
of
when
snow
lay
in
the
garden
noisy
flowers
were
relentlessly
banished
from
the
a
flower
arrangement
by
a
loses
its
significance
if
removed
from
the
place
for
which
it
was
originally
intended
for
its
lines
and
proportions
have
been
specially
worked
out
with
a
view
to
its
surroundings
the
adoration
of
the
flower
for
its
own
sake
begins
with
the
rise
of
toward
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
now
becomes
independent
of
the
and
knows
no
law
save
that
the
vase
imposes
on
it
new
conceptions
and
methods
of
execution
now
become
possible
and
many
were
the
principles
and
schools
resulting
therefrom
a
writer
in
the
middle
of
the
last
century
said
he
could
count
over
one
hundred
different
schools
of
flower
arrangement
broadly
speaking
these
divide
themselves
into
two
main
branches
the
formalistic
and
the
naturalesque
the
formalistic
schools
led
by
the
ikenobos
aimed
at
a
classic
idealism
corresponding
to
that
of
the
we
possess
records
of
arrangements
by
the
early
masters
of
the
school
which
almost
reproduce
the
flower
paintings
of
sansetsu
and
tsunenobu
the
naturalesque
school
on
the
other
hand
accepted
nature
as
its
model
only
imposing
such
modifications
of
form
as
conduced
to
the
expression
of
artistic
unity
thus
we
recognise
in
its
works
the
same
impulses
which
formed
the
ukiyoe
and
shijo
schools
of
painting
it
would
be
interesting
had
we
time
to
enter
more
fully
than
it
is
now
possible
into
the
laws
of
composition
and
detail
formulated
by
the
various
of
this
period
showing
as
they
would
the
fundamental
theories
which
governed
tokugawa
decoration
we
find
them
referring
to
the
leading
principle
heaven
the
subordinate
principle
earth
the
reconciling
principle
man
and
any
flower
arrangement
which
did
not
embody
these
principles
was
considered
barren
and
dead
they
also
dwelt
much
on
the
importance
of
treating
a
flower
in
its
three
different
aspects
the
formal
the
and
the
informal
the
first
might
be
said
to
represent
flowers
in
the
stately
costume
of
the
ballroom
the
second
in
the
easy
elegance
of
afternoon
dress
the
third
in
the
charming
deshabille
of
the
boudoir
our
personal
sympathies
are
with
the
of
the
rather
than
with
those
of
the
the
former
is
art
in
its
proper
setting
and
appeals
to
us
on
account
of
its
true
intimacy
with
life
we
should
like
to
call
this
school
the
natural
in
contradistinction
to
the
naturalesque
and
formalistic
schools
the
deems
his
duty
ended
with
the
selection
of
the
flowers
and
leaves
them
to
tell
their
own
story
entering
a
in
late
winter
you
may
see
a
slender
spray
of
wild
cherries
in
combination
with
a
budding
camellia
it
is
an
echo
of
departing
winter
coupled
with
the
prophecy
of
spring
again
if
you
go
into
a
on
some
irritatingly
hot
summer
day
you
may
discover
in
the
darkened
coolness
of
the
tokonoma
a
single
lily
in
a
hanging
vase
dripping
with
dew
it
seems
to
smile
at
the
foolishness
of
life
a
solo
of
flowers
is
interesting
but
in
a
concerto
with
painting
and
sculpture
the
combination
becomes
entrancing
sekishiu
once
placed
some
in
a
flat
receptacle
to
suggest
the
vegetation
of
lakes
and
marshes
and
on
the
wall
above
he
hung
a
painting
by
soami
of
wild
ducks
flying
in
the
air
shoha
another
combined
a
poem
on
the
beauty
of
solitude
by
the
sea
with
a
bronze
incense
burner
in
the
form
of
a
fisherman
hut
and
some
wild
flowers
of
the
beach
one
of
the
guests
has
recorded
that
he
felt
in
the
whole
composition
the
breath
of
waning
autumn
flower
stories
are
endless
we
shall
recount
but
one
more
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
was
as
yet
a
rare
plant
with
us
rikiu
had
an
entire
garden
planted
with
it
which
he
cultivated
with
assiduous
care
the
fame
of
his
convulvuli
reached
the
ear
of
the
taiko
and
he
expressed
a
desire
to
see
them
in
consequence
of
which
rikiu
invited
him
to
a
morning
tea
at
his
house
on
the
appointed
day
taiko
walked
through
the
garden
but
nowhere
could
he
see
any
vestige
of
the
convulvulus
the
ground
had
been
leveled
and
strewn
with
fine
pebbles
and
sand
with
sullen
anger
the
despot
entered
the
but
a
sight
waited
him
there
which
completely
restored
his
humour
on
the
tokonoma
in
a
rare
bronze
of
sung
workmanship
lay
a
single
the
queen
of
the
whole
garden
in
such
instances
we
see
the
full
significance
of
the
flower
sacrifice
perhaps
the
flowers
appreciate
the
full
significance
of
it
they
are
not
cowards
like
men
some
flowers
glory
in
death
certainly
the
japanese
cherry
blossoms
do
as
they
freely
surrender
themselves
to
the
winds
anyone
who
has
stood
before
the
fragrant
avalanche
at
yoshino
or
arashiyama
must
have
realized
this
for
a
moment
they
hover
like
bejewelled
clouds
and
dance
above
the
crystal
streams
then
as
they
sail
away
on
the
laughing
waters
they
seem
to
say
farewell
o
spring
we
are
on
to
eternity
vii
in
religion
the
future
is
behind
us
in
art
the
present
is
the
eternal
the
held
that
real
appreciation
of
art
is
only
possible
to
those
who
make
of
it
a
living
influence
thus
they
sought
to
regulate
their
daily
life
by
the
high
standard
of
refinement
which
obtained
in
the
in
all
circumstances
serenity
of
mind
should
be
maintained
and
conversation
should
be
conducted
as
never
to
mar
the
harmony
of
the
surroundings
the
cut
and
color
of
the
dress
the
poise
of
the
body
and
the
manner
of
walking
could
all
be
made
expressions
of
artistic
personality
these
were
matters
not
to
be
lightly
ignored
for
until
one
has
made
himself
beautiful
he
has
no
right
to
approach
beauty
thus
the
strove
to
be
something
more
than
the
artist
art
itself
it
was
the
zen
of
aestheticism
perfection
is
everywhere
if
we
only
choose
to
recognise
it
rikiu
loved
to
quote
an
old
poem
which
says
to
those
who
long
only
for
flowers
fain
would
i
show
the
spring
which
abides
in
the
toiling
buds
of
hills
manifold
indeed
have
been
the
contributions
of
the
to
art
they
completely
revolutionised
the
classical
architecture
and
interior
decorations
and
established
the
new
style
which
we
have
described
in
the
chapter
of
the
a
style
to
whose
influence
even
the
palaces
and
monasteries
built
after
the
sixteenth
century
have
all
been
subject
the
has
left
notable
examples
of
his
genius
in
the
imperial
villa
of
katsura
the
castles
of
nagoya
and
nijo
and
the
monastery
of
kohoan
all
the
celebrated
gardens
of
japan
were
laid
out
by
the
our
pottery
would
probably
never
have
attained
its
high
quality
of
excellence
if
the
had
not
lent
it
to
their
inspiration
the
manufacture
of
the
utensils
used
in
the
calling
forth
the
utmost
expenditure
of
ingenuity
on
the
parts
of
our
ceramists
the
seven
kilns
of
enshiu
are
well
known
to
all
students
of
japanese
pottery
many
of
our
textile
fabrics
bear
the
names
of
who
conceived
their
color
or
design
it
is
impossible
indeed
to
find
any
department
of
art
in
which
the
have
not
left
marks
of
their
genius
in
painting
and
lacquer
it
seems
almost
superfluous
to
mention
the
immense
services
they
have
rendered
one
of
the
greatest
schools
of
painting
owes
its
origin
to
the
famed
also
as
a
lacquer
artist
and
potter
beside
his
works
the
splendid
creation
of
his
grandson
koho
and
of
his
korin
and
kenzan
almost
fall
into
the
shade
the
whole
korin
school
as
it
is
generally
designated
is
an
expression
of
teaism
in
the
broad
lines
of
this
school
we
seem
to
find
the
vitality
of
nature
herself
great
as
has
been
the
influence
of
the
in
the
field
of
art
it
is
as
nothing
compared
to
that
which
they
have
exerted
on
the
conduct
of
life
not
only
in
the
usages
of
polite
society
but
also
in
the
arrangement
of
all
our
domestic
details
do
we
feel
the
presence
of
the
many
of
our
delicate
dishes
as
well
as
our
way
of
serving
food
are
their
inventions
they
have
taught
us
to
dress
only
in
garments
of
sober
colors
they
have
instructed
us
in
the
proper
spirit
in
which
to
approach
flowers
they
have
given
emphasis
to
our
natural
love
of
simplicity
and
shown
us
the
beauty
of
humility
in
fact
through
their
teachings
tea
has
entered
the
life
of
the
people
those
of
us
who
know
not
the
secret
of
properly
regulating
our
own
existence
on
this
tumultuous
sea
of
foolish
troubles
which
we
call
life
are
constantly
in
a
state
of
misery
while
vainly
trying
to
appear
happy
and
contented
we
stagger
in
the
attempt
to
keep
our
moral
equilibrium
and
see
forerunners
of
the
tempest
in
every
cloud
that
floats
on
the
horizon
yet
there
is
joy
and
beauty
in
the
roll
of
billows
as
they
sweep
outward
toward
eternity
why
not
enter
into
their
spirit
or
like
liehtse
ride
upon
the
hurricane
itself
he
only
who
has
lived
with
the
beautiful
can
die
beautifully
the
last
moments
of
the
great
were
as
full
of
exquisite
refinement
as
had
been
their
lives
seeking
always
to
be
in
harmony
with
the
great
rhythm
of
the
universe
they
were
ever
prepared
to
enter
the
unknown
the
last
tea
of
rikiu
will
stand
forth
forever
as
the
acme
of
tragic
grandeur
long
had
been
the
friendship
between
rikiu
and
the
and
high
the
estimation
in
which
the
great
warrior
held
the
but
the
friendship
of
a
despot
is
ever
a
dangerous
honour
it
was
an
age
rife
with
treachery
and
men
trusted
not
even
their
nearest
kin
rikiu
was
no
servile
courtier
and
had
often
dared
to
differ
in
argument
with
his
fierce
patron
taking
advantage
of
the
coldness
which
had
for
some
time
existed
between
the
taiko
and
rikiu
the
enemies
of
the
latter
accused
him
of
being
implicated
in
a
conspiracy
to
poison
the
despot
it
was
whispered
to
hideyoshi
that
the
fatal
potion
was
to
be
administered
to
him
with
a
cup
of
the
green
beverage
prepared
by
the
with
hideyoshi
suspicion
was
sufficient
ground
for
instant
execution
and
there
was
no
appeal
from
the
will
of
the
angry
ruler
one
privilege
alone
was
granted
to
the
condemned
the
honor
of
dying
by
his
own
hand
on
the
day
destined
for
his
rikiu
invited
his
chief
disciples
to
a
last
mournfully
at
the
appointed
time
the
guests
met
at
the
portico
as
they
look
into
the
garden
path
the
trees
seem
to
shudder
and
in
the
rustling
of
their
leaves
are
heard
the
whispers
of
homeless
ghosts
like
solemn
sentinels
before
the
gates
of
hades
stand
the
grey
stone
lanterns
a
wave
of
rare
incense
is
wafted
from
the
it
is
the
summons
which
bids
the
guests
to
enter
one
by
one
they
advance
and
take
their
places
in
the
tokonoma
hangs
a
kakemon
a
wonderful
writing
by
an
ancient
monk
dealing
with
the
evanescence
of
all
earthly
things
the
singing
kettle
as
it
boils
over
the
brazier
sounds
like
some
cicada
pouring
forth
his
woes
to
departing
summer
soon
the
host
enters
the
room
each
in
turn
is
served
with
tea
and
each
in
turn
silently
drains
his
cup
the
host
last
of
all
according
to
established
etiquette
the
chief
guest
now
asks
permission
to
examine
the
rikiu
places
the
various
articles
before
them
with
the
kakemono
after
all
have
expressed
admiration
of
their
beauty
rikiu
presents
one
of
them
to
each
of
the
assembled
company
as
a
souvenir
the
bowl
alone
he
keeps
never
again
shall
this
cup
polluted
by
the
lips
of
misfortune
be
used
by
man
he
speaks
and
breaks
the
vessel
into
fragments
the
ceremony
is
over
the
guests
with
difficulty
restraining
their
tears
take
their
last
farewell
and
leave
the
room
one
only
the
nearest
and
dearest
is
requested
to
remain
and
witness
the
end
rikiu
then
removes
his
and
carefully
folds
it
upon
the
mat
thereby
disclosing
the
immaculate
white
death
robe
which
it
had
hitherto
concealed
tenderly
he
gazes
on
the
shining
blade
of
the
fatal
dagger
and
in
exquisite
verse
thus
addresses
it
welcome
to
thee
o
sword
of
eternity
through
buddha
and
through
dharuma
alike
thou
hast
cleft
thy
way
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
rikiu
passed
forth
into
the
unknown
