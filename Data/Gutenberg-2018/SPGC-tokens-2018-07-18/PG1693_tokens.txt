dangerous
days
by

chapter
i
natalie
spencer
was
giving
a
dinner
she
was
not
an
easy
hostess
like
most
women
of
futile
lives
she
lacked
a
sense
of
proportion
and
the
small
and
unimportant
details
of
the
service
absorbed
her
such
conversation
as
she
threw
at
random
to
right
and
left
was
trivial
and
distracted
yet
the
dinner
was
an
unimportant
one
it
had
been
given
with
an
eye
more
to
the
menu
than
to
the
guest
list
which
was
characteristic
of
natalie
mental
processes
it
was
also
characteristic
that
when
the
final
course
had
been
served
without
mishap
and
she
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
before
the
gesture
of
withdrawal
which
was
a
signal
to
the
other
women
that
she
had
realized
no
lack
in
it
the
food
had
been
good
the
service
satisfactory
she
stood
up
slim
and
beautifully
dressed
and
gathered
up
the
women
with
a
smile
the
movement
found
doctor
haverford
at
her
left
unprepared
and
with
his
coffee
cup
in
his
hand
he
put
it
down
hastily
and
rose
and
the
small
cup
overturned
in
its
saucer
sending
a
smudge
of
brown
into
the
cloth
dreadfully
awkward
of
me
he
said
the
clergyman
smile
of
apology
was
boyish
but
he
was
suddenly
aware
that
his
hostess
was
annoyed
he
caught
his
wife
amiable
eyes
on
him
too
and
they
said
quite
plainly
that
one
might
spill
coffee
at
home
one
quite
frequently
did
to
confess
a
good
man
weakness
but
one
did
not
do
it
at
natalie
spencer
table
the
rector
smile
died
into
a
sheepish
grin
for
the
first
time
since
dinner
began
natalie
spencer
had
a
clear
view
of
her
husband
face
not
that
that
had
mattered
particularly
but
the
flowers
had
been
too
high
for
a
small
dinner
low
flowers
always
she
would
speak
to
the
florist
but
having
glanced
at
clayton
standing
tall
and
handsome
at
the
head
of
the
table
she
looked
again
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
with
a
curious
intentness
he
seemed
to
be
surveying
her
from
the
top
of
her
burnished
hair
to
the
very
gown
she
wore
his
gaze
made
her
vaguely
uncomfortable
it
was
unsmiling
appraising
almost
only
that
was
incredible
in
clay
almost
hostile
through
the
open
door
the
half
dozen
women
trailed
out
natalie
in
white
softly
rustling
as
she
moved
haverford
in
black
velvet
a
trifle
tight
over
her
ample
figure
marion
hayden
in
a
very
brief
garment
she
would
have
called
a
frock
perennial
debutante
that
she
was
rather
negligible
terry
mackenzie
and
trailing
behind
the
others
frankly
loath
to
leave
the
men
audrey
valentine
clayton
spencer
eyes
rested
on
audrey
with
a
smile
of
amused
toleration
on
her
outrageously
low
green
gown
that
was
somehow
casually
elegant
on
her
long
green
and
jade
chain
on
the
cigaret
between
her
slim
fingers
audrey
audacity
always
amused
him
in
the
doorway
she
turned
and
nonchalantly
surveyed
the
room
for
heaven
sake
hurry
she
apostrophized
the
table
we
are
going
to
knit
i
feel
it
and
do
give
chris
anything
more
to
drink
clay
he
had
she
went
on
a
slim
green
figure
moving
slowly
and
reluctantly
toward
the
her
head
held
high
a
little
smile
still
on
her
lips
but
alone
for
a
moment
away
from
curious
eyes
her
expression
changed
her
smile
faded
her
lovely
irregular
face
took
on
a
curious
intensity
what
a
devilish
evening
chris
drinking
too
much
talking
wildly
and
always
with
furtive
eyes
on
her
chris
oh
well
that
was
life
she
supposed
she
stopped
before
a
long
mirror
and
gave
a
bit
of
careless
attention
to
her
hair
with
more
care
she
tinted
her
lips
again
with
a
cosmetic
stick
from
the
tiny
bag
she
carried
then
she
turned
and
surveyed
the
hall
and
the
library
beyond
a
new
portrait
of
natalie
was
there
hanging
on
the
wall
under
a
shaded
light
and
she
wandered
in
still
with
her
cigaret
and
surveyed
it
natalie
had
everything
the
portrait
showed
it
it
was
beautiful
smug
complacent
valentine
eyes
narrowed
slightly
she
stood
there
thinking
about
natalie
she
had
not
everything
after
all
there
was
something
she
lacked
charm
perhaps
she
was
a
cold
woman
but
then
clay
was
cold
too
he
was
even
a
bit
hard
men
said
that
hard
and
ambitious
although
he
was
popular
men
liked
strong
men
it
was
only
the
weak
they
deplored
and
loved
poor
chris
she
lounged
into
the
smiling
her
slow
cool
smile
in
the
big
uncarpeted
alcove
where
stood
natalie
great
painted
piano
marion
hayden
was
playing
softly
carefully
posed
for
the
entrance
of
the
men
natalie
was
sitting
with
her
hands
folded
in
the
exact
center
of
a
divan
the
others
were
knitting
very
pretty
effect
toots
audrey
called
and
miss
hayden
gave
her
the
unashamed
smile
of
one
woman
of
the
world
to
another
audrey
had
a
malicious
impulse
she
sat
down
beside
natalie
and
against
the
blue
divan
her
green
gown
shrieked
a
discord
she
was
vastly
amused
when
natalie
found
an
excuse
and
moved
away
to
dispose
herself
carefully
in
a
tall
chair
which
framed
her
like
a
picture
we
were
talking
of
men
my
dear
said
haverford
placidly
knitting
of
course
said
audrey
flippantly
of
what
it
is
that
they
want
more
than
anything
else
in
the
put
in
mackenzie
she
was
a
robust
big
woman
with
kindly
eyes
and
she
was
childless
women
called
toots
hayden
she
was
still
posed
but
she
had
stopped
playing
haverford
eyes
rested
on
her
a
moment
disapprovingly
what
do
you
say
natalie
audrey
asked
i
had
thought
about
it
money
you
are
all
wrong
said
audrey
and
lighted
a
fresh
cigaret
they
want
different
things
at
different
ages
that
why
marriage
is
such
a
rotten
failure
first
they
want
women
any
woman
will
do
really
so
they
marry
any
woman
then
they
want
money
after
that
they
want
power
and
place
and
when
they
got
that
they
begin
to
want
good
gracious
audrey
what
a
cynical
speech
said
mackenzie
if
they
been
married
all
that
time
oh
tut
said
audrey
rudely
she
had
the
impulse
of
the
unhappy
woman
to
hurt
but
she
was
rather
ashamed
of
herself
too
these
women
were
her
friends
let
them
go
on
believing
that
life
was
a
thing
of
lasting
loves
that
men
were
true
to
the
end
and
that
the
relationships
of
life
were
fixed
and
permanent
things
i
sorry
she
said
i
was
just
being
clever
let
talk
about
the
war
it
the
only
thing
worth
talking
about
in
the
clayton
spencer
standing
tall
and
erect
had
watched
the
women
go
out
how
typical
the
party
was
of
natalie
of
her
meticulous
care
in
small
things
and
her
indifference
or
real
ignorance
as
to
what
counted
was
it
indifference
really
or
was
it
supreme
craftiness
the
stupidity
of
her
dinners
the
general
unattractiveness
of
the
women
she
gathered
around
her
the
of
people
who
had
little
in
themselves
and
nothing
whatever
in
common
of
all
the
party
only
audrey
and
the
rector
had
interested
him
even
remotely
audrey
amused
him
audrey
was
a
curious
mixture
of
intelligence
and
frivolity
she
was
a
good
fellow
sometimes
he
thought
she
was
a
nice
woman
posing
as
not
quite
nice
he
did
know
he
was
not
particularly
analytical
but
at
least
she
had
been
one
bit
of
cheer
during
the
endless
succession
of
courses
the
rector
was
the
other
and
he
was
relieved
to
find
doctor
haverford
moving
up
to
the
vacant
place
at
his
right
i
been
wanting
to
see
you
clay
he
said
in
an
undertone
rather
stupid
to
ask
you
how
you
found
things
over
there
but
i
going
to
do
you
mean
the
war
there
nothing
else
in
the
world
is
there
one
would
have
thought
so
from
the
conversation
here
clayton
spencer
glanced
about
the
table
rodney
page
the
architect
was
telling
a
story
clearly
not
for
the
ears
of
the
clergy
and
his
own
son
graham
forced
in
at
the
last
moment
to
fill
a
vacancy
was
sitting
alone
bored
and
rather
sulky
and
sipping
his
third
cognac
if
you
want
my
opinion
things
are
for
the
allies
or
for
us
good
heavens
man
it
the
same
thing
it
is
only
the
allies
who
are
standing
between
us
and
trouble
now
the
french
are
just
holding
their
own
the
british
are
fighting
hard
but
they
fighting
at
home
too
we
ca
sit
by
for
long
we
bound
to
be
the
rector
lighted
an
excellent
cigar
even
if
we
are
he
said
hopefully
i
understand
our
part
of
it
will
be
purely
naval
and
i
believe
our
navy
will
give
an
excellent
account
of
probably
clay
retorted
if
it
had
anything
to
fight
but
with
the
german
fleet
bottled
up
and
the
inadvisability
of
attempting
to
bombard
berlin
from
the
sea
the
rector
made
no
immediate
reply
and
clayton
seemed
to
expect
none
he
sat
back
tapping
the
table
with
long
nervous
fingers
and
his
eyes
wandered
from
the
table
around
the
room
he
surveyed
it
all
with
much
the
look
he
had
given
natalie
a
few
moments
before
searching
appraising
vaguely
hostile
yet
it
was
a
lovely
room
simple
and
stately
rodney
page
who
was
by
way
of
being
decorator
for
the
few
as
he
was
architect
for
the
many
had
done
the
room
with
its
plainly
paneled
walls
the
with
an
old
painting
inset
its
lion
chairs
its
two
console
tables
with
each
its
pair
of
porcelain
jars
clayton
liked
the
dignity
of
the
room
but
there
were
times
when
he
and
natalie
sat
at
the
great
table
alone
with
only
the
candles
for
light
and
the
rest
of
the
room
in
a
darkness
from
which
the
butler
emerged
at
stated
intervals
and
retreated
again
when
he
felt
the
oppression
of
it
for
a
dinner
party
with
the
brilliant
colors
of
the
women
gowns
it
was
ideal
for
natalie
and
himself
alone
with
the
long
silences
between
them
that
seemed
to
grow
longer
as
the
years
went
on
it
was
inexpressibly
dreary
he
was
frequently
aware
that
both
natalie
and
himself
were
talking
for
the
butler
benefit
from
the
room
his
eyes
traveled
to
graham
sitting
alone
uninterested
dull
and
somewhat
flushed
and
on
graham
too
he
fixed
that
clear
appraising
gaze
that
had
vaguely
disconcerted
natalie
the
boy
had
had
too
much
to
drink
and
unlike
the
group
across
the
table
it
had
made
him
sullen
and
quiet
he
sat
there
staring
moodily
at
the
cloth
and
turning
his
glass
around
in
fingers
that
trembled
somewhat
then
he
found
himself
involved
in
the
conversation
london
as
dark
as
they
say
inquired
christopher
valentine
he
was
a
thin
young
man
with
a
small
affectedly
curled
mustache
clayton
did
not
care
for
him
but
natalie
found
him
amusing
i
have
been
over
he
really
said
for
ages
eight
months
or
very
dark
hard
to
get
most
of
the
fellows
i
know
over
there
are
doing
something
i
like
to
run
over
but
what
the
use
nobody
around
street
dark
no
gayety
no
you
better
stay
at
home
they
do
particularly
want
visitors
unless
they
go
for
war
contracts
eh
said
valentine
pleasantly
a
way
he
had
of
taking
the
edge
off
the
frequent
impertinence
of
his
speech
no
i
not
going
over
we
not
popular
over
there
i
understand
keep
on
thinking
we
ought
to
take
a
hand
in
the
dirty
graham
spoke
unexpectedly
well
do
you
think
we
ought
if
you
want
my
candid
opinion
no
we
been
waving
a
red
flag
called
the
monroe
doctrine
for
some
little
time
as
a
signal
that
we
stand
for
europe
coming
over
here
and
grabbing
anything
if
we
going
to
be
consistent
we
ca
do
any
grabbing
in
europe
can
we
clayton
eyed
him
rather
contemptuously
we
might
want
to
as
you
term
it
a
share
in
putting
the
madmen
of
europe
into
chains
he
said
i
thought
you
were
only
as
to
clothes
women
and
filet
of
sole
chris
returned
flippantly
then
seeing
graham
glowering
at
him
across
the
table
he
dropped
his
affectation
of
frivolity
what
the
use
of
our
going
in
now
he
argued
this
somme
push
is
the
biggest
thing
yet
going
through
the
germans
like
a
hay
cutter
through
a
field
german
losses
half
a
million
and
what
about
the
allies
have
they
lost
nothing
this
was
attorney
an
irishman
named
denis
nolan
there
had
been
two
n
in
the
denis
originally
but
although
he
had
disposed
of
a
part
of
his
birthright
he
was
still
belligerently
irish
what
about
rumania
what
about
the
russians
at
lemberg
what
about
saloniki
you
irish
said
the
rector
genially
always
fighting
the
world
and
each
other
tell
me
nolan
why
is
it
that
you
always
have
individual
humor
and
collective
he
felt
that
that
was
rather
neat
but
nolan
was
regarding
him
acrimoniously
and
clayton
apparently
had
not
heard
at
all
the
dispute
went
on
chris
valentine
alternately
flippant
and
earnest
the
rector
conciliatory
graham
glowering
and
silent
nolan
had
started
on
the
irish
question
and
rodney
baited
him
with
the
prospect
of
conscription
there
nolan
voice
full
and
mellow
and
strangely
sweet
dominated
the
room
but
clayton
was
not
listening
he
had
heard
nolan
air
his
views
before
he
was
a
trifle
acid
was
nolan
he
needed
mellowing
a
woman
in
his
life
but
nolan
had
loved
once
and
the
girl
had
died
with
the
curious
constancy
of
the
irish
he
had
remained
determinedly
celibate
strange
race
clayton
reflected
idly
as
nolan
voice
sang
on
know
what
they
want
but
want
it
like
the
devil
men
too
curious
it
occurred
to
him
then
that
his
own
reflection
was
as
odd
as
the
fidelity
of
the
irish
he
had
been
faithful
to
his
wife
he
had
never
thought
of
being
anything
else
he
did
not
pursue
that
line
of
thought
he
sat
back
and
resumed
his
nervous
tapping
of
the
cloth
not
listening
hardly
thinking
but
conscious
of
a
discontent
that
was
beyond
analysis
clayton
had
been
aware
since
his
return
from
the
continent
and
england
days
before
of
a
change
in
himself
he
had
not
recognized
it
until
he
reached
home
and
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
feeling
it
he
had
gone
abroad
for
certain
italian
contracts
and
had
obtained
them
a
year
or
two
if
the
war
lasted
so
long
and
he
would
be
on
his
feet
at
last
after
years
of
struggle
to
keep
his
organization
together
through
the
hard
times
that
preceded
the
war
he
would
be
much
more
than
on
his
feet
given
three
more
years
of
war
and
he
would
be
a
very
rich
man
and
now
that
the
goal
was
within
sight
he
was
finding
that
it
was
not
money
he
wanted
there
were
some
things
money
could
not
buy
he
had
always
spent
money
his
anxieties
had
not
influenced
his
scale
of
living
money
for
instance
could
not
buy
peace
for
the
world
or
peace
for
a
man
either
it
had
only
one
value
for
a
man
it
gave
him
independence
of
other
men
made
him
free
three
things
said
the
rector
apropos
of
something
or
other
and
rather
oratorically
are
required
by
the
normal
man
work
play
and
love
assure
the
crippled
soldier
that
he
has
lost
none
of
these
and
work
and
play
and
love
well
god
knows
he
had
worked
play
he
would
have
to
take
up
golf
again
more
regularly
he
ought
to
play
three
times
a
week
perhaps
he
could
take
a
now
and
then
too
natalie
would
like
that
love
he
had
not
thought
about
love
very
much
a
married
man
of
certainly
had
no
business
thinking
about
love
no
he
certainly
did
not
want
love
he
felt
rather
absurd
even
thinking
about
it
and
yet
in
the
same
flash
came
a
thought
of
the
violent
passions
of
his
early
twenties
there
had
been
a
time
when
he
had
suffered
horribly
because
natalie
had
not
wanted
to
marry
him
he
was
glad
all
that
was
over
no
he
certainly
did
not
want
love
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
straightened
up
how
about
those
plans
rodney
he
inquired
genially
natalie
says
you
have
them
ready
to
look
i
bring
them
round
any
time
you
then
better
not
lose
any
time
building
is
going
to
be
a
slow
matter
at
the
slow
and
expensive
page
added
he
smiled
at
his
host
but
clayton
spencer
remained
grave
i
been
away
he
said
and
i
do
know
what
natalie
and
you
have
cooked
up
between
you
but
just
remember
this
i
want
a
comfortable
country
house
i
do
want
a
public
page
looked
uncomfortable
the
move
into
the
covered
his
uneasiness
but
he
found
a
moment
later
on
to
revert
to
the
subject
i
have
tried
to
carry
out
natalie
ideas
clay
he
said
she
wanted
a
sizeable
place
you
know
a
wing
for
and
that
sort
of
clayton
eyes
roamed
about
the
room
where
portly
haverford
was
still
knitting
placidly
where
the
chris
valentines
were
quarreling
under
pretense
of
raillery
where
toots
hayden
was
smoking
a
cigaret
in
a
corner
and
smiling
up
at
graham
and
where
natalie
exquisite
and
precise
was
supervising
the
laying
out
of
a
bridge
table
she
would
of
course
he
observed
rather
curtly
and
moving
through
a
french
window
went
out
onto
a
small
balcony
into
the
night
he
was
irritated
with
himself
what
had
come
over
him
he
shook
himself
and
drew
a
long
breath
of
the
sweet
night
air
his
tall
boyishly
straight
figure
dominated
the
little
place
in
the
he
looked
indeed
like
an
overgrown
boy
he
always
looked
like
graham
brother
anyhow
it
was
one
of
natalie
complaints
against
him
but
he
put
the
thought
of
natalie
away
along
with
his
new
discontent
by
george
it
was
something
to
feel
that
if
a
man
could
not
fight
in
this
war
at
least
he
could
make
shells
to
help
end
it
oblivious
to
the
laughter
in
the
room
behind
him
the
clink
of
glass
as
was
brought
in
he
planned
there
in
the
darkness
new
organization
new
expansions
and
found
in
it
a
great
content
he
was
proud
of
his
mills
they
were
his
of
his
making
the
small
iron
foundry
of
his
father
building
had
developed
into
the
colossal
furnaces
that
night
after
night
lighted
the
district
like
a
great
conflagration
he
was
proud
of
his
mills
and
of
his
men
he
liked
to
take
men
and
see
them
work
out
his
judgment
of
them
he
was
not
often
wrong
take
that
room
behind
him
rodney
page
dilettante
liked
by
women
who
called
him
roddie
a
trifle
unscrupulous
but
not
entirely
a
knave
the
sort
of
man
one
trusted
with
everything
but
one
wife
chris
too
only
he
let
married
women
alone
and
forgot
to
pay
back
the
money
he
borrowed
there
was
only
one
man
in
the
room
about
whom
he
was
beginning
to
mistrust
his
judgment
and
that
was
his
own
son
perhaps
it
was
because
he
had
so
recently
come
from
lands
where
millions
of
boys
like
graham
were
pouring
out
their
young
lives
like
wine
that
clayton
spencer
was
seeing
graham
with
a
new
vision
he
turned
and
glanced
back
into
the
where
graham
in
the
center
of
that
misfit
group
and
not
quite
himself
was
stooping
over
marion
hayden
they
would
have
to
face
that
of
course
the
woman
urge
in
the
boy
until
now
his
escapades
had
been
boyish
ones
a
few
debts
frankly
revealed
and
as
frankly
regretted
some
college
mischiefs
a
rather
serious
gambling
fever
quickly
curbed
but
never
women
thank
god
but
now
the
boy
was
through
with
college
and
already
he
noticed
something
new
in
their
relationship
natalie
had
always
spoiled
him
and
now
there
were
with
increasing
frequency
small
consultations
in
her
room
when
he
was
shut
out
and
he
was
beginning
to
notice
a
restraint
in
his
relations
with
the
boy
as
though
mother
and
son
had
united
against
him
he
was
confident
that
natalie
was
augmenting
graham
allowance
from
her
own
his
salary
rather
for
he
had
taken
the
boy
into
the
business
not
as
a
partner
that
would
come
later
but
as
the
manager
of
a
department
he
never
spoke
to
natalie
of
money
her
house
bills
were
paid
at
the
office
without
question
but
only
that
day
miss
potter
his
secretary
had
reported
that
spencer
bank
had
called
up
and
he
had
made
good
a
considerable
overdraft
he
laid
the
cause
of
his
discontent
to
graham
finally
the
boy
had
good
stuff
in
him
he
was
not
going
to
allow
natalie
to
spoil
him
or
to
withdraw
him
into
that
little
realm
of
detachment
in
which
she
lived
natalie
did
not
need
him
and
had
not
either
as
a
lover
or
a
husband
for
years
but
the
boy
did
there
was
a
little
stir
in
the
room
behind
the
haverfords
were
leaving
and
the
hayden
girl
who
was
plainly
finding
the
party
dull
graham
was
looking
down
at
her
a
tall
handsome
boy
with
natalie
blonde
hair
but
his
father
height
and
almost
insolent
good
looks
come
around
she
was
saying
about
four
there
always
a
crowd
about
five
you
clayton
knew
and
felt
a
misgiving
the
hayden
house
was
a
late
afternoon
loafing
and
meeting
place
for
the
idle
sons
and
daughters
of
the
rich
not
the
conservative
old
families
who
had
developed
a
sense
of
the
responsibility
of
wealth
but
of
the
second
generation
of
easily
acquired
money
as
she
went
out
with
graham
at
her
elbow
he
heard
chris
at
the
bridge
table
terrible
house
the
haydens
just
one
step
from
the
saturday
night
carouse
in
clay
mill
when
graham
came
back
haverford
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
i
wish
you
would
come
to
see
us
graham
delight
so
often
speaks
of
graham
stiffened
almost
imperceptibly
thanks
i
but
his
tone
was
distant
you
know
she
comes
out
this
really
and
you
were
great
friends
i
think
she
misses
you
a
i
wish
i
thought
so
gentle
haverford
glanced
up
at
him
quickly
you
know
she
does
approve
of
why
graham
well
ask
her
he
said
and
there
was
a
real
bitterness
under
the
lightness
of
his
tone
i
come
of
course
haverford
thank
you
for
asking
me
i
have
a
lot
of
time
i
a
sort
of
clerk
down
at
the
mill
you
natalie
overheard
and
her
eyes
met
clayton
with
a
glance
of
malicious
triumph
she
had
been
deeply
resentful
that
he
had
not
made
graham
a
partner
at
once
he
remembered
a
conversation
they
had
had
a
few
months
before
why
should
he
have
to
start
at
the
bottom
she
had
protested
you
have
never
been
quite
fair
to
him
his
boyish
diminutive
had
stuck
to
him
you
expect
him
to
know
as
much
about
the
mill
now
as
you
do
after
all
these
not
at
all
i
want
him
to
learn
that
precisely
the
reason
why
not
taking
him
in
at
how
much
salary
is
he
to
have
three
thousand
a
three
thousand
why
it
will
take
all
of
that
to
buy
him
a
there
are
three
cars
here
now
i
should
think
he
could
every
boy
wants
his
own
i
pay
my
other
managers
three
thousand
he
had
said
still
patient
he
will
live
here
his
car
can
be
kept
here
without
expense
personally
i
think
it
too
much
money
for
the
service
he
will
be
able
to
give
for
the
first
year
or
and
although
she
had
let
it
go
at
that
he
had
felt
in
her
a
keen
resentment
graham
had
got
a
car
of
his
own
was
using
it
hard
if
the
bills
the
chauffeur
presented
were
an
indication
and
natalie
had
overdrawn
her
account
two
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
the
evening
wore
on
two
tables
of
bridge
were
going
with
denis
nolan
sitting
in
at
one
money
in
large
amounts
was
being
written
in
on
the
bridge
scores
the
air
of
the
room
was
heavy
with
smoke
and
all
the
men
and
some
of
the
women
were
drinking
rather
too
much
there
were
splotches
of
color
under
the
tan
in
graham
cheeks
and
even
laughter
had
taken
on
a
higher
note
chris
words
rankled
in
clayton
spencer
mind
a
step
from
the
saturday
night
carouse
how
much
better
was
this
sort
of
thing
a
dull
party
driven
to
cards
and
drink
to
get
through
the
evening
and
what
sort
of
home
life
were
he
and
natalie
giving
the
boy
either
this
or
the
dreary
evenings
when
they
were
alone
with
natalie
sifting
with
folded
hands
or
withdrawing
to
her
boudoir
upstairs
where
invariably
she
summoned
graham
to
talk
to
him
behind
closed
doors
he
went
into
the
library
and
shut
the
door
the
room
rested
him
after
the
babble
across
he
lighted
a
cigar
and
stood
for
a
moment
before
natalie
portrait
it
had
been
painted
while
he
was
abroad
at
he
suspected
rodney
instigation
it
left
him
quite
cold
as
did
natalie
herself
he
could
look
at
it
dispassionately
as
he
had
never
quite
cared
to
regard
natalie
between
them
personally
there
was
always
the
element
she
never
allowed
him
to
forget
that
she
had
given
him
a
son
this
was
natalie
herself
natalie
at
girlish
beautiful
fretful
and
selfish
natalie
with
whom
he
was
to
live
the
rest
of
his
life
who
was
to
share
his
wealth
and
his
future
and
with
whom
he
shared
not
a
single
thought
in
common
he
had
a
curious
sense
of
disloyalty
as
he
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
picked
up
a
pad
and
pencil
but
a
moment
later
he
had
forgotten
her
as
he
had
forgotten
the
party
across
the
hall
he
had
work
to
do
thank
god
for
work
chapter
ii
natalie
was
in
bed
when
he
went
through
the
door
of
his
he
could
see
her
lying
surrounded
by
papers
handsome
bed
was
always
covered
with
things
her
handkerchief
a
novel
her
silk
flung
over
the
footboard
sometimes
bits
of
dress
materials
and
lace
natalie
did
most
of
her
planning
in
bed
he
went
in
and
clearing
a
space
sat
down
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
facing
her
her
hair
was
arranged
in
a
loose
knot
on
top
of
her
head
and
there
was
a
tiny
space
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
inch
slightly
darker
than
the
rest
he
realized
with
a
little
start
that
she
had
had
her
hair
touched
up
during
his
absence
still
she
looked
very
pretty
her
skin
slightly
glistening
with
its
night
bath
of
cold
cream
her
slim
arms
lying
out
on
the
blue
silk
eiderdown
coverlet
i
told
doctor
haverford
that
we
would
like
to
give
him
a
car
natalie
he
began
directly
it
was
typical
of
him
the
a
car
what
for
to
ride
about
in
my
dear
it
rather
a
large
parish
you
know
and
i
do
feel
exactly
comfortable
seeing
him
tramping
along
when
most
people
are
awheel
he
not
very
he
kill
himself
that
well
that
rather
up
to
providence
of
you
are
throwing
a
sop
to
providence
are
you
she
asked
shrewdly
throwing
bread
on
the
waters
i
daresay
he
angled
for
it
you
easy
clay
give
you
a
good
dinner
it
was
a
nice
dinner
was
it
a
very
nice
dinner
he
assented
but
at
the
tone
she
looked
up
well
what
was
wrong
she
demanded
i
saw
when
i
went
out
that
you
were
angry
about
something
your
face
was
oh
come
now
natalie
he
protested
it
was
anything
of
the
sort
the
dinner
was
all
right
the
guests
were
all
right
i
may
have
unconsciously
resented
your
attitude
about
doctor
haverford
certainly
he
did
angle
for
it
and
i
had
no
idea
of
throwing
a
sop
to
that
is
what
was
wrong
at
do
you
really
want
me
to
tell
you
not
if
it
too
good
heavens
natalie
one
would
think
i
bullied
you
oh
no
you
do
bully
it
worse
it
the
way
you
look
your
face
sets
well
i
did
feel
unpleasant
it
rather
my
misfortune
that
my
face
did
you
like
my
gown
very
much
it
seemed
a
trifle
low
but
you
know
i
always
like
your
he
was
almost
pathetically
anxious
to
make
up
to
her
for
that
moment
disloyalty
in
the
library
there
she
said
brushing
the
papers
aside
now
we
getting
at
it
was
i
anything
like
as
low
as
audrey
valentine
of
course
not
her
back
you
just
drive
me
to
despair
clay
nothing
i
do
pleases
you
the
very
tone
of
that
secretary
of
yours
when
i
told
her
about
that
it
was
positively
insulting
i
do
like
overdrafts
he
said
without
any
irritation
when
you
want
extra
amounts
you
have
only
to
let
me
you
are
always
finding
fault
with
me
she
complained
it
either
money
or
my
clothes
or
graham
or
her
eyes
filled
she
looked
young
and
absurdly
childish
but
a
talk
he
had
had
with
the
rector
was
still
in
his
mind
it
was
while
they
were
still
at
the
table
and
nolan
had
been
attacking
the
british
government
we
get
out
of
this
world
largely
what
we
put
into
it
he
had
said
you
give
largely
clay
and
you
receive
largely
i
rejoice
in
your
prosperity
because
you
have
earned
you
think
then
he
had
asked
that
we
only
receive
as
we
give
i
do
mean
material
things
of
the
rector
had
fixed
him
with
kindly
rather
faded
old
eyes
that
has
been
my
experience
he
said
happiness
for
instance
only
comes
when
we
forget
our
eternal
search
for
it
and
try
to
make
others
happy
even
religion
is
changing
the
old
selfish
idea
of
saving
our
own
souls
has
given
way
largely
to
the
saving
of
others
by
giving
them
a
chance
to
redeem
themselves
decent
living
conditions
he
had
gone
on
but
clayton
had
not
listened
very
intently
he
had
been
wondering
if
happiness
was
not
the
thing
he
had
somehow
missed
it
was
then
that
he
had
decided
to
give
the
car
if
after
all
that
would
make
for
the
rector
happiness
i
do
want
to
find
fault
with
you
natalie
he
said
gravely
i
would
like
to
see
you
happy
sometimes
i
think
you
are
not
i
have
my
business
but
you
have
nothing
to
do
and
i
suppose
you
would
be
interested
in
would
you
there
are
a
lot
of
committees
and
since
i
been
in
england
i
realize
what
a
vast
amount
is
needed
clothes
you
know
and
bandages
and
well
nothing
to
do
she
looked
up
her
eyes
wide
and
indignant
but
of
course
you
would
think
that
this
house
runs
itself
i
let
be
honest
natalie
he
said
with
a
touch
of
impatience
actually
how
much
time
each
day
do
you
give
this
house
you
have
plenty
of
trained
servants
an
hour
two
hours
i
not
discuss
it
with
she
took
up
a
typewritten
sheet
and
pretended
to
read
it
carefully
clayton
had
a
conviction
that
if
he
was
actually
hunting
happiness
he
had
begun
his
search
for
it
rather
badly
he
took
the
paper
from
her
gently
what
this
he
inquired
anything
i
should
not
see
decorator
estimates
for
the
new
her
voice
was
resentful
you
have
to
see
them
some
library
curtains
gray
chippendale
velvet
gold
gimp
faced
with
colonial
yellow
he
read
an
item
picked
at
random
two
thousand
dollars
that
going
some
for
curtains
is
it
it
not
too
much
for
that
sort
of
but
look
here
natalie
he
expostulated
this
is
to
be
a
country
house
is
it
i
thought
you
wanted
chintzed
and
homey
things
this
looks
like
a
city
house
in
the
he
glanced
down
at
the
total
the
hangings
alone
with
a
tapestry
or
two
were
to
be
thousand
dollars
he
whistled
hangings
alone
and
what
sort
of
a
house
has
rodney
planned
anyhow
italian
with
a
sunken
garden
the
landscape
estimates
are
there
he
did
not
look
at
them
it
seems
to
me
you
and
rodney
have
been
pretty
busy
while
i
been
away
he
remarked
well
i
want
you
to
be
happy
my
dear
only
i
do
want
to
tie
up
a
fortune
just
now
we
may
get
into
this
war
and
if
we
do
he
rose
and
yawned
his
arms
above
his
head
i
off
to
bed
he
said
big
day
i
want
graham
at
the
office
at
she
had
sat
up
in
bed
and
was
staring
at
him
her
face
was
pale
do
you
mean
that
we
are
going
to
get
into
this
war
i
think
it
very
likely
my
but
if
we
do
graham
we
might
as
well
face
it
graham
will
probably
want
to
he
do
nothing
of
the
sort
she
said
sharply
he
all
i
have
all
do
you
think
i
going
to
send
him
over
there
to
be
i
wo
let
him
she
was
trembling
violently
i
wo
want
him
to
go
of
course
but
if
the
thing
comes
he
of
age
you
she
eyed
him
with
thinly
veiled
hostility
you
hard
clay
she
accused
him
you
hard
all
the
way
through
you
proud
too
proud
and
hard
you
want
to
be
able
to
say
your
son
was
in
the
army
it
not
because
you
care
anything
about
the
war
except
to
make
money
out
of
it
what
is
the
war
to
you
anyhow
you
do
like
the
english
and
as
for
french
you
do
even
let
me
have
a
french
he
was
not
the
less
angry
because
he
realized
the
essential
truth
of
part
of
what
she
said
he
felt
no
great
impulse
of
sympathy
with
any
of
the
combatants
he
knew
the
gravity
of
the
situation
rather
than
its
tragedy
he
did
not
like
war
any
war
he
saw
no
reason
why
men
should
kill
but
this
war
was
a
fact
he
had
had
no
hand
in
its
making
but
it
was
made
his
first
impulse
was
to
leave
her
in
dignified
silence
but
she
was
crying
and
i
he
disliked
leaving
her
in
tears
dead
as
was
his
love
for
her
and
that
night
somehow
he
knew
that
it
was
dead
she
was
still
his
wife
they
had
had
some
fairly
happy
years
together
long
ago
and
he
felt
the
need
too
of
justification
perhaps
you
are
right
natalie
he
said
after
a
moment
i
cared
about
this
war
as
much
as
i
should
not
the
human
side
of
it
anyhow
but
you
ought
to
understand
that
by
making
shells
for
the
allies
i
am
not
only
making
money
for
myself
they
need
the
shells
and
i
give
them
the
best
i
do
intend
only
to
profit
by
their
she
had
hardly
listened
then
if
we
get
into
it
as
you
say
you
encourage
graham
to
go
i
shall
allow
him
to
go
if
he
feels
it
his
oh
duty
duty
i
sick
of
the
she
bent
forward
and
suddenly
caught
one
of
his
hands
you
wo
make
him
go
clay
she
begged
you
you
let
him
make
his
own
decision
if
you
what
do
you
mean
if
you
keep
your
hands
off
too
we
not
in
it
yet
god
knows
i
hope
we
wo
be
but
if
i
promise
not
to
influence
him
you
must
do
the
same
i
have
any
more
influence
over
graham
than
that
she
said
and
snapped
her
finger
but
she
did
not
look
at
him
promise
he
said
steadily
oh
all
her
voice
and
face
were
sulky
she
looked
much
as
graham
had
that
evening
at
the
table
is
that
a
promise
good
heavens
do
you
want
me
to
swear
to
it
i
want
you
to
play
fair
that
she
leaned
back
again
among
her
pillows
and
gathered
her
papers
all
right
she
said
indifferently
have
you
any
preference
as
to
color
for
your
rooms
in
the
new
house
he
was
sorry
for
his
anger
and
after
all
these
things
which
seemed
so
unimportant
to
him
were
the
things
that
made
up
her
life
he
smiled
you
might
match
my
eyes
i
not
sure
what
color
they
are
perhaps
you
but
she
had
not
forgiven
him
i
never
noticed
she
replied
and
small
bundle
of
samples
in
her
hand
resumed
her
reading
and
her
inspection
of
textiles
good
night
good
she
did
not
look
up
outside
his
wife
door
he
hesitated
then
he
crossed
and
without
knocking
entered
graham
bedroom
the
boy
was
lounging
in
a
long
chair
by
an
open
fire
he
was
in
his
dressing
gown
and
slippers
and
an
empty
glass
stood
beside
him
on
a
small
stand
graham
was
sound
asleep
clayton
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
but
he
slept
on
his
head
to
one
side
his
breathing
slow
and
heavy
it
required
some
little
effort
to
waken
him
graham
said
clayton
sharply
he
stirred
but
did
not
open
his
eyes
graham
wake
up
graham
sat
up
suddenly
and
looked
at
him
the
whites
of
his
eyes
were
red
but
he
had
slept
off
the
dinner
wine
he
was
quite
himself
better
get
to
bed
his
father
suggested
i
want
you
early
what
time
sir
he
leaned
forward
and
pressed
a
button
beside
the
what
are
you
doing
that
for
ice
water
awfully
the
servants
have
gone
to
bed
go
down
and
get
it
graham
looked
up
at
the
tone
at
his
father
eyes
he
looked
away
sorry
sir
he
said
must
have
had
too
much
champagne
was
much
else
to
do
was
there
mother
parties
my
god
what
a
dreary
lot
clayton
inspected
the
ice
water
carafe
on
the
stand
and
found
it
empty
i
bring
you
some
water
from
my
room
he
said
and
i
do
want
to
see
you
this
way
again
graham
when
a
man
can
not
take
a
little
wine
at
his
own
table
without
taking
too
much
he
fails
to
be
entirely
a
he
went
out
when
he
came
back
graham
was
standing
by
the
fire
in
his
pajamas
looking
young
and
rather
ashamed
clayton
had
a
flash
of
those
earlier
days
when
he
had
come
in
to
bid
the
boy
good
night
and
there
had
always
been
that
last
request
for
water
which
was
to
postpone
the
final
switching
off
of
the
light
i
sorry
clayton
put
his
hand
on
the
boy
shoulder
and
patted
him
we
have
to
do
better
next
time
that
for
a
moment
the
veil
of
constraint
of
natalie
weaving
lifted
between
them
i
a
pretty
bad
egg
i
guess
you
better
shove
me
off
the
dock
and
let
me
swim
or
i
hardly
like
to
do
that
you
know
you
are
all
i
i
no
good
at
the
you
have
had
very
much
time
i
been
a
good
many
years
learning
the
i
never
be
any
good
not
there
if
there
was
something
to
build
up
it
would
be
different
but
it
all
done
you
done
it
i
only
a
sort
of
sublimated
clerk
i
do
mean
he
added
hastily
that
i
think
i
ought
to
have
anything
more
it
only
that
well
the
over
if
you
know
what
i
i
talk
to
you
about
that
get
to
bed
now
it
one
he
moved
to
the
doorway
graham
carafe
in
hand
stood
staring
ahead
of
him
he
had
the
courage
of
the
last
and
a
sort
of
desperate
contrition
yes
i
wish
you
let
me
go
to
france
and
something
like
a
cold
hand
seemed
to
close
round
clayton
heart
fly
why
because
i
not
doing
any
good
here
and
because
i
like
to
see
if
i
have
any
good
stuff
in
me
all
the
fellows
are
going
he
added
rather
weakly
that
not
a
particularly
worthy
reason
is
it
it
about
as
worthy
as
making
money
out
of
shells
when
we
have
any
reason
for
selling
them
to
the
allies
more
than
the
germans
except
that
we
ca
ship
to
the
he
looked
rather
frightened
then
but
clayton
was
not
angry
he
saw
natalie
fine
hand
there
and
the
boy
impressionable
nature
think
that
over
graham
he
said
gravely
i
do
believe
you
quite
mean
it
he
went
across
to
his
own
bedroom
where
his
silk
pajamas
neatly
folded
lay
on
his
painted
louis
xvi
bed
under
his
reading
lamp
there
was
a
book
it
was
a
part
of
natalie
decorative
scheme
for
the
room
it
binding
was
mauve
to
match
the
hangings
for
the
first
time
since
the
room
had
been
done
over
during
his
absence
he
picked
up
the
book
rodney
idea
for
a
cent
he
reflected
looking
rather
grimly
at
the
cover
he
undressed
slowly
his
mind
full
of
graham
and
the
problem
he
presented
then
he
thought
of
natalie
and
of
the
little
things
that
made
up
her
life
and
filled
her
days
he
glanced
about
the
room
beautiful
formal
exquisitely
appointed
his
father
portrait
was
gone
from
over
the
mantel
and
an
old
french
hung
there
instead
that
was
too
bad
of
natalie
or
had
it
been
rodney
he
would
bring
it
back
and
he
gave
a
fleeting
thought
to
graham
and
his
request
to
go
abroad
he
had
not
meant
it
it
was
sheer
reaction
but
he
would
talk
to
graham
he
lighted
a
cigaret
and
getting
into
bed
turned
on
his
reading
lamp
queer
how
a
man
could
build
and
then
find
that
after
all
he
did
not
care
for
the
achievement
it
was
the
building
alone
that
was
worth
while
he
picked
up
the
book
from
the
table
and
opened
it
casually
when
first
i
loved
i
gave
my
very
soul
utterly
unreserved
to
love
control
but
love
deceived
me
wrenched
my
youth
away
and
made
the
gold
of
life
forever
gray
long
i
lived
lonely
yet
i
tried
in
vain
with
any
other
joy
to
stifle
pain
there
is
no
other
joy
i
learned
to
know
and
so
returned
to
love
as
long
ago
yet
i
this
little
while
ere
i
go
hence
love
very
lightly
now
in
self
twaddle
said
clayton
spencer
and
put
the
book
away
that
was
the
sort
of
stuff
men
like
rodney
lived
on
in
a
mauve
binding
too
after
he
had
put
out
the
light
he
lay
for
a
long
time
staring
into
the
darkness
it
was
not
love
he
wanted
he
was
through
with
all
that
power
was
the
thing
integrity
and
power
to
yield
to
no
man
to
achieve
independence
for
one
soul
not
that
he
put
it
that
way
he
formulated
it
drowsily
to
give
a
damn
for
any
one
so
long
as
you
right
of
course
it
was
not
always
possible
to
know
if
one
was
right
he
yawned
his
conscious
mind
was
drowsing
and
from
the
depths
below
released
of
the
sentry
of
his
waking
hours
came
the
call
of
his
starved
imagination
chapter
iii
there
was
no
moral
to
be
adduced
from
graham
waking
the
next
morning
he
roused
reluctantly
enough
but
blithe
and
hungry
he
sang
as
he
splashed
in
his
shower
chose
his
tie
whistling
and
went
down
the
staircase
two
steps
at
a
time
to
a
ravenous
breakfast
clayton
was
already
at
the
table
in
the
breakfast
room
sitting
back
with
the
newspaper
his
coffee
at
his
elbow
the
first
cigarette
of
the
morning
half
smoked
he
looked
rather
older
in
the
morning
light
small
fine
threads
had
begun
to
show
themselves
at
the
corners
of
his
eyes
the
lines
of
repression
from
the
nostrils
to
the
corners
of
the
mouth
seemed
deeper
but
his
invincible
look
of
boyishness
persisted
at
that
there
was
no
awkwardness
in
graham
morning
he
had
not
forgotten
the
night
before
but
he
had
already
forgiven
himself
he
ignored
the
newspaper
at
his
plate
and
dug
into
his
grapefruit
anything
new
he
inquired
casually
you
might
look
and
see
clayton
suggested
i
read
going
down
in
the
car
ca
stand
war
news
on
an
empty
stomach
mother
all
right
this
morning
i
think
she
is
still
well
i
should
say
she
needs
it
after
last
night
how
in
the
world
we
manage
with
all
the
interesting
people
in
the
world
to
get
together
such
a
dreary
lot
as
that
lord
it
was
clayton
rose
and
folded
his
paper
the
car
waiting
he
said
i
be
ready
in
five
he
went
slowly
up
the
stairs
in
her
pink
bedroom
natalie
had
just
wakened
madeleine
her
elderly
french
maid
had
brought
her
breakfast
and
she
was
lying
back
among
the
pillows
the
litter
of
the
early
mail
about
her
and
a
morning
paper
on
her
knee
he
bent
over
and
kissed
her
perfunctorily
and
he
was
quick
to
see
that
her
resentment
of
the
evening
before
had
survived
the
night
sleep
well
he
inquired
looking
down
at
her
she
evaded
his
eyes
not
any
plans
for
i
just
play
around
i
lunching
out
and
i
may
run
out
with
rodney
to
linndale
the
landscape
men
are
there
she
picked
up
the
newspaper
as
though
to
end
the
discussion
he
saw
then
that
she
was
reading
the
society
news
and
he
rather
more
than
surmised
that
she
had
not
even
glanced
at
the
black
headings
which
on
the
first
page
announced
the
hideous
casualties
of
the
somme
then
you
given
the
planting
contract
some
things
have
to
go
in
in
the
fall
clay
for
heaven
sake
look
like
a
thunder
have
you
given
the
landscape
contract
yes
and
please
go
out
you
make
my
head
how
much
is
it
to
be
i
do
know
ask
i
do
nothing
of
the
sort
my
dear
this
is
not
rodney
nor
mine
i
suppose
all
i
want
you
to
do
natalie
is
to
consult
me
i
want
you
to
have
a
free
hand
but
some
one
with
a
sense
of
responsibility
ought
to
check
up
these
expenditures
but
it
is
only
that
i
like
to
have
a
hand
in
the
thing
myself
i
rather
looked
forward
to
the
time
when
we
could
have
the
sort
of
country
place
we
you
do
like
any
of
the
strings
to
get
out
of
your
fingers
do
you
i
did
come
up
to
quarrel
natalie
i
wish
you
would
force
it
on
i
force
it
on
you
she
cried
and
laughed
in
a
forced
and
note
just
because
i
wo
be
without
a
protest
through
that
all
i
sha
go
near
the
place
you
do
understand
he
persisted
patiently
i
happen
to
like
gardens
i
had
an
idea
i
told
you
about
it
of
trying
to
duplicate
the
old
garden
at
home
you
remember
it
when
we
went
there
on
our
honeymoon
you
do
call
that
a
garden
of
course
i
did
want
to
copy
it
exactly
it
was
old
and
out
of
condition
but
there
were
a
lot
of
flowers
if
you
intend
to
build
an
italian
villa
naturally
i
do
intend
to
build
anything
or
to
plant
her
voice
was
frozen
you
go
ahead
do
it
in
your
own
way
and
then
you
can
live
there
if
you
like
i
which
was
what
he
carried
away
with
him
that
morning
to
the
mill
he
was
not
greatly
disturbed
by
her
threat
to
keep
her
hands
off
he
knew
quite
well
indeed
that
the
afternoon
would
find
her
with
rodney
page
picking
her
way
in
her
shoes
over
the
waste
that
was
some
day
to
bloom
not
like
the
rose
of
his
desire
but
according
to
the
formal
and
rigid
blueprint
which
rodney
would
be
carrying
but
in
five
minutes
he
had
put
the
incident
out
of
his
mind
after
all
if
it
gave
her
happiness
and
occupation
certainly
she
needed
both
and
his
powers
of
inhibition
were
strong
for
many
years
he
had
walled
up
the
small
frictions
of
his
married
life
and
its
disappointments
and
outside
that
wall
had
built
up
an
existence
of
his
own
which
was
the
mill
when
he
went
he
found
that
graham
had
ordered
his
own
car
and
was
already
in
it
drawing
on
his
gloves
have
to
come
back
early
dad
he
called
in
explanation
and
drove
off
going
at
the
reckless
speed
he
affected
clayton
rode
down
alone
in
the
limousine
he
had
meant
to
outline
his
plans
of
expansion
to
graham
but
he
had
had
no
intention
of
consulting
him
in
his
own
department
the
boy
did
neither
better
nor
worse
than
any
other
of
the
dozens
of
young
men
in
the
organization
if
he
had
shown
neither
special
aptitude
for
nor
interest
in
the
business
he
had
at
least
not
signally
failed
to
show
either
now
paper
and
pencil
in
hand
clayton
jotted
down
the
various
details
of
the
new
system
in
their
sequence
the
building
of
a
forging
plant
to
make
the
rough
casts
for
the
new
italian
shells
out
of
the
steel
from
the
furnaces
the
construction
of
a
new
spur
to
the
little
railway
which
bound
the
old
plant
together
with
its
shining
steel
rails
there
were
questions
of
supplies
and
shipping
and
bank
credits
to
face
the
vast
and
complex
problems
of
the
complete
new
munition
works
to
be
built
out
of
town
and
involving
such
matters
as
the
housing
of
enormous
numbers
of
employees
he
scrawled
figures
and
added
them
even
with
the
size
of
the
foreign
contract
their
magnitude
startled
him
he
leaned
back
his
mouth
compressed
the
lines
from
the
nostrils
to
the
corners
deeper
than
ever
he
had
completely
forgotten
natalie
and
the
country
house
outside
the
gates
to
the
mill
enclosure
he
heard
an
early
extra
being
called
and
bought
it
the
austrian
premier
had
been
assassinated
the
successful
french
against
verdun
was
corroborated
also
on
the
center
of
the
front
page
was
the
first
photograph
to
reach
america
of
a
tank
he
inspected
it
with
interest
so
the
allies
had
at
last
shown
same
inventive
genius
of
their
own
perhaps
this
was
but
the
beginning
even
at
that
enough
of
these
fighting
mammoths
and
the
war
might
end
quickly
with
the
tanks
and
the
allied
offensive
and
the
evidence
of
discontent
in
austria
the
thing
might
after
all
be
over
before
america
was
involved
he
reflected
however
that
an
early
peace
would
not
be
an
unmixed
blessing
for
him
he
wanted
the
war
to
end
he
hated
killing
he
felt
inarticulately
that
something
horrible
was
happening
to
the
world
but
personally
his
plans
were
premised
on
a
war
to
last
at
least
two
years
more
until
the
fall
of
that
would
let
him
out
cover
the
cost
of
the
new
plant
bring
renewals
of
his
foreign
contracts
justify
those
stupendous
figures
on
the
paper
in
his
hand
he
wondered
rather
uncomfortably
what
he
would
do
under
the
circumstances
if
it
were
in
his
power
to
declare
peace
in
his
office
in
the
mill
administration
building
he
found
the
general
manager
waiting
through
the
door
into
the
conference
room
beyond
he
could
see
the
superintendents
of
the
various
departments
with
graham
rather
aloof
and
detached
and
a
sprinkling
of
the
most
important
foremen
on
his
desk
neatly
machined
was
the
first
tentative
made
in
the
mill
an
experiment
rather
than
a
realization
hutchinson
the
general
manager
was
not
alone
opposite
him
very
neatly
dressed
in
his
best
clothes
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
a
set
expression
on
his
face
was
one
of
the
boss
rollers
of
the
steel
mill
herman
klein
at
clayton
entrance
he
made
a
motion
to
depart
but
hutchinson
stopped
him
tell
spencer
what
you
been
telling
me
klein
he
said
curtly
klein
fingered
his
hat
but
his
face
remained
set
i
just
been
saying
spencer
he
said
in
good
english
but
with
the
guttural
accent
which
thirty
years
in
america
had
not
eliminated
that
i
be
leaving
you
leaving
why
because
of
that
he
pointed
without
intentional
drama
at
the
i
ca
make
those
shells
for
you
spencer
and
me
a
you
an
american
are
you
i
am
sir
it
is
not
that
it
iss
that
i
his
face
worked
he
had
dropped
back
to
the
old
idiom
after
years
of
painful
struggle
to
abandon
it
it
iss
that
i
am
a
german
also
i
have
people
there
in
the
war
to
make
shells
to
kill
them
he
is
determined
spencer
said
hutchinson
i
have
been
arguing
with
him
but
you
ca
argue
with
a
clayton
was
uneasily
aware
of
something
like
sympathy
for
the
man
i
understand
how
you
feel
klein
he
observed
but
of
course
you
know
whether
you
go
or
stay
the
shells
will
be
made
i
know
you
are
throwing
up
a
good
i
try
to
get
the
prospective
loss
of
klein
was
a
rather
serious
one
clayton
seated
behind
his
great
desk
eyed
him
keenly
and
then
stooped
to
bribery
he
mentioned
a
change
in
the
wage
scale
with
bonuses
to
all
foremen
and
rollers
he
knew
klein
pride
in
the
mill
and
he
outlined
briefly
the
growth
that
was
about
to
be
developed
but
the
boss
roller
remained
obdurate
he
understood
that
such
things
were
to
be
but
it
was
not
necessary
that
he
assist
germany
enemies
against
her
against
the
determination
in
his
heavy
square
figure
clayton
argued
in
vain
when
ten
minutes
later
he
went
into
the
conference
room
followed
by
a
secretary
with
a
sheaf
of
papers
the
mill
was
minus
a
boss
roller
and
there
was
rankling
in
his
mind
klein
last
words
i
haf
no
objection
spencer
to
your
making
money
out
of
this
war
but
i
will
there
had
been
no
insolence
in
his
tone
he
had
gone
out
with
his
heavy
german
stolidity
of
mien
unchanged
and
had
closed
the
door
behind
him
with
quiet
finality
chapter
iv
graham
left
the
conference
that
morning
in
a
rather
exalted
mood
the
old
mill
was
coming
into
its
own
at
last
he
had
a
sense
of
boyish
triumph
in
the
new
developments
a
feeling
of
being
a
part
of
big
activities
that
would
bring
rich
rewards
and
he
felt
a
new
pride
in
his
father
he
had
sat
a
little
way
from
the
long
table
and
had
watched
the
faces
of
the
men
gathered
about
it
as
clearly
and
forcibly
the
outlines
of
the
new
departure
were
given
out
hitherto
spencer
had
made
steel
only
now
they
were
not
only
to
make
the
steel
but
they
were
to
forge
the
ingots
into
rough
casts
these
casts
were
then
to
be
carried
to
the
new
munition
works
there
to
be
machined
drilled
polished
provided
with
fuses
which
spencer
were
also
to
make
and
shipped
abroad
the
question
of
speeding
production
had
been
faced
and
met
the
various
problems
had
been
discussed
and
the
bonus
system
tentatively
taken
up
then
the
men
had
dispersed
each
infected
with
the
drive
of
his
contagious
force
pretty
fine
old
boy
graham
had
considered
and
he
wondered
vaguely
if
when
his
time
came
he
would
be
able
to
take
hold
for
a
few
minutes
natalie
closetings
lost
their
effect
he
saw
his
father
not
as
one
from
whom
to
hide
extravagance
and
unpaid
bills
but
as
the
head
of
a
great
concern
that
was
now
to
be
a
part
of
the
war
itself
he
wandered
into
his
father
office
and
picked
up
the
shell
clayton
was
already
at
his
letters
but
looked
up
think
we
rather
had
them
eh
graham
think
you
did
sir
carried
them
off
their
feet
pretty
is
it
he
held
up
the
if
a
fellow
could
only
forget
what
the
damned
things
are
for
they
are
to
help
to
end
the
war
said
clayton
crisply
do
forget
that
and
went
back
to
his
steady
dictation
graham
went
out
of
the
building
into
the
mill
yard
the
noise
always
irritated
him
he
had
none
of
clayton
joy
and
understanding
of
it
to
clayton
each
sound
had
its
corresponding
activity
to
graham
it
was
merely
din
an
annoyance
to
his
ears
as
the
mill
yard
outraged
his
fastidiousness
but
that
morning
he
found
it
rather
more
bearable
he
stooped
where
in
front
of
the
store
the
storekeeper
had
planted
a
tiny
garden
some
small
chrysanthemums
were
still
there
and
he
picked
one
and
put
it
in
his
buttonhole
his
own
office
was
across
the
yard
he
dodged
in
front
of
a
yard
locomotive
picked
his
way
about
masses
of
lumber
and
the
general
litter
of
all
mill
yards
and
opened
the
door
of
his
own
building
just
inside
his
office
a
girl
was
sitting
on
a
straight
chair
her
hat
a
trifle
crooked
and
her
eyes
red
from
crying
he
paused
in
amazement
why
miss
klein
he
said
what
the
matter
she
was
rather
a
pretty
girl
even
now
she
stood
up
at
his
voice
and
made
an
effort
to
straighten
her
hat
have
you
heard
she
asked
i
have
heard
anything
that
ought
to
make
miss
anna
klein
weep
of
a
nice
frosty
morning
in
october
unless
he
sobered
for
her
grief
was
evident
tell
me
about
father
has
given
up
his
no
i
telling
you
spencer
he
wo
help
to
make
those
shells
been
acting
queer
for
three
or
four
days
and
this
morning
he
told
your
graham
whistled
as
if
it
made
any
difference
she
went
on
irritably
some
one
else
will
get
his
job
that
all
what
does
he
care
about
the
germans
he
left
them
and
came
to
america
as
soon
as
he
could
graham
sat
down
now
let
get
this
he
said
he
wo
make
shells
for
the
allies
and
so
he
given
up
his
position
all
right
that
bad
but
he
a
good
workman
he
not
have
any
trouble
getting
another
job
now
why
are
you
crying
i
did
think
you
want
me
to
stay
putting
her
fear
into
words
brought
back
her
long
hours
of
terror
she
collapsed
into
the
chair
again
and
fell
to
unquiet
sobbing
graham
was
disturbed
you
a
queer
girl
he
said
why
should
that
lose
me
my
most
valued
assistant
when
she
made
no
reply
he
got
up
and
going
over
to
her
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
tell
me
that
he
said
he
looked
down
at
her
the
hair
grew
very
soft
and
blonde
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
and
he
ran
a
finger
lightly
across
it
tell
me
i
was
afraid
it
and
even
if
it
had
which
you
are
a
goose
for
thinking
you
just
as
good
in
your
line
as
your
father
is
in
his
i
been
expecting
any
time
to
hear
of
your
leaving
me
for
a
handsomer
man
he
had
been
what
he
would
have
termed
jollying
her
back
to
normality
again
but
to
his
intense
surprise
she
suddenly
leaned
back
and
looked
up
into
his
face
there
was
no
doubting
what
he
saw
there
just
for
a
moment
the
situation
threatened
to
get
out
of
hand
then
he
patted
her
shoulders
and
put
the
safety
of
his
desk
between
them
run
away
and
bathe
your
eyes
he
said
and
then
come
back
here
looking
like
the
best
secretary
in
the
state
and
not
like
a
winter
thaw
we
have
the
deuce
of
a
lot
of
work
to
but
after
she
had
gone
he
sat
for
some
little
time
idly
rapping
a
pencil
on
the
top
of
his
desk
by
jove
anna
klein
of
all
girls
in
the
world
it
was
rather
a
pity
too
she
was
a
nice
little
thing
and
in
the
last
few
months
she
had
changed
a
lot
she
had
been
timid
at
first
and
hideously
dressed
lately
she
had
been
almost
smart
those
now
they
changed
her
a
lot
queer
how
things
went
on
in
a
girl
mind
and
a
fellow
did
know
until
something
happened
he
settled
his
tie
and
smoothed
back
his
heavy
hair
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
he
began
to
wonder
if
he
had
not
been
a
fatuous
idiot
anna
did
her
work
with
the
thoroughness
of
her
german
blood
plus
her
american
training
she
came
back
minus
her
hat
and
with
her
eyes
carefully
powdered
and
not
once
during
the
morning
was
he
able
to
meet
her
eyes
fully
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
sex
vanity
and
curiosity
began
to
get
the
better
of
his
judgment
and
he
made
an
excuse
when
she
stood
beside
him
over
some
papers
her
hand
on
the
desk
to
lay
his
fingers
over
hers
she
drew
her
hand
away
quickly
and
when
he
glanced
up
boyishly
smiling
her
face
was
flushed
please
she
said
and
he
felt
hurt
and
rebuffed
he
had
no
sentiment
for
her
whatever
but
the
devil
of
mischief
of
was
behind
him
urging
him
on
to
the
eternal
experiment
he
was
very
formal
with
her
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
leaving
her
at
four
and
miserable
over
her
machine
in
the
little
office
next
to
his
he
forgot
her
immediately
in
the
attempt
to
leave
the
mill
without
encountering
his
father
clayton
he
knew
would
be
staying
late
and
would
be
exacting
similar
tribute
to
the
emergency
from
the
entire
force
also
he
had
been
going
about
the
yard
with
contractors
most
of
the
afternoon
but
graham
made
his
escape
safely
it
was
two
hours
later
when
his
father
getting
into
the
limousine
noticed
the
absence
of
the
boy
red
car
and
asked
the
gateman
how
long
it
had
been
gone
since
about
four
suddenly
clayton
felt
a
reaction
from
the
activities
of
the
day
he
sank
back
in
the
deeply
padded
seat
and
felt
tired
and
in
some
odd
fashion
lonely
he
would
have
liked
to
talk
to
graham
on
the
way
if
only
to
crystallize
his
own
thoughts
he
would
have
liked
to
be
going
home
to
review
with
natalie
the
day
events
the
fine
spirit
of
his
men
the
small
difficulties
but
natalie
hated
the
mention
of
the
mill
he
thought
it
probable
too
that
they
were
dining
out
yes
he
remembered
they
were
dining
at
the
chris
valentines
well
that
was
better
than
it
might
have
been
they
were
not
dull
anyhow
his
mind
wandered
to
the
valentine
house
small
not
too
frequently
noisy
but
always
gay
and
extremely
smart
he
thought
of
audrey
and
her
curious
friendship
with
natalie
audrey
the
careless
with
her
dark
lazy
charm
her
deep
and
rather
husky
contralto
her
astonishing
little
french
songs
which
she
sang
with
nonchalant
grace
and
her
crowds
of
boyish
admirers
whom
she
alternately
petted
and
bullied
surely
she
and
natalie
had
little
enough
in
common
yet
in
the
last
year
or
so
he
had
been
continually
coming
across
them
together
at
the
club
at
luncheon
in
the
women
dining
room
at
his
own
house
natalie
always
perfectly
and
expensively
dressed
audrey
in
the
casual
garments
which
somehow
her
wearing
made
effective
he
smiled
a
little
certain
of
audrey
impertinences
came
to
his
mind
she
was
an
amusing
young
woman
he
had
an
idea
that
she
was
always
in
debt
and
that
the
fact
concerned
her
very
little
he
fancied
that
few
things
concerned
her
very
deeply
including
chris
but
she
knew
about
food
her
dinners
were
as
casual
as
her
house
as
to
service
but
they
were
worth
eating
she
claimed
to
pay
for
them
out
of
her
bridge
winnings
and
indeed
her
invitation
for
had
been
frankness
itself
i
going
to
have
a
party
clay
she
had
said
i
made
two
killings
at
bridge
and
somebody
has
shipped
chris
some
ducks
if
you
send
me
some
cigarets
like
the
last
i
make
it
he
had
sent
the
cigarets
and
this
was
tuesday
the
pleasant
rolling
of
the
car
soothed
him
the
street
flashed
by
brilliant
with
lights
that
in
far
perspective
seemed
to
meet
the
shop
windows
gleamed
with
color
from
curb
to
curb
were
other
cars
like
the
one
in
which
he
rode
carrying
home
other
men
like
himself
to
whatever
the
evening
held
in
store
he
remembered
london
at
this
hour
already
dark
and
quiet
its
few
motors
making
their
cautious
way
in
the
dusk
its
throngs
of
clerks
nearly
all
women
now
hurrying
home
to
whatever
dread
the
night
might
hold
and
it
made
him
slightly
more
complacent
these
things
that
he
had
taken
for
granted
before
had
since
his
return
assumed
the
quality
of
luxury
pray
god
we
wo
get
into
it
he
said
to
himself
he
reviewed
his
unrest
of
the
night
before
and
smiled
at
it
happiness
happiness
came
from
a
sense
of
achievement
integrity
and
power
that
was
the
combination
the
respect
of
one
fellow
men
the
work
well
done
romance
was
done
at
his
age
but
there
remained
the
adventure
of
success
a
few
years
more
and
he
would
leave
the
mill
to
graham
and
play
awhile
after
that
he
had
always
liked
politics
they
needed
business
men
in
politics
if
men
of
training
and
leisure
would
only
go
in
for
it
there
would
be
some
chance
of
cleaning
up
the
situation
yes
he
might
do
that
he
was
an
easy
speaker
and
the
car
drew
up
at
the
curb
and
the
chauffeur
got
out
natalie
car
had
drawn
up
just
ahead
and
the
footman
was
already
opening
the
door
rodney
page
got
out
and
assisted
natalie
to
alight
clayton
smiled
so
she
had
changed
her
mind
he
saw
rodney
bend
over
her
hand
and
kiss
it
after
his
usual
ceremonious
manner
natalie
seemed
a
trifle
breathless
when
she
turned
and
saw
him
you
early
are
you
she
said
i
fancy
it
is
you
who
are
then
he
realized
that
the
chauffeur
was
waiting
to
speak
to
him
yes
jackson
i
sorry
sir
i
guess
i
be
leaving
at
the
end
of
my
month
come
into
the
library
and
i
talk
to
you
what
wrong
there
nothing
wrong
sir
i
have
been
very
well
suited
it
only
i
used
to
be
in
the
regular
army
sir
and
i
guess
i
going
to
be
needed
you
mean
we
are
going
to
be
involved
yes
sir
i
think
we
there
no
answer
to
that
jackson
he
said
but
a
sense
of
irritation
stirred
him
as
he
went
up
the
steps
to
the
house
door
jackson
was
a
good
man
jackson
and
klein
and
who
knew
who
would
be
next
oh
damn
the
war
he
reflected
rather
wearily
chapter
v
the
winter
which
preceded
the
entrance
of
the
united
states
into
the
war
was
socially
an
extraordinary
one
it
was
marked
by
an
almost
feverish
gayety
as
though
having
apparently
determined
to
pursue
a
policy
dictated
purely
by
self
interest
the
people
wished
to
forget
their
anomalous
position
like
a
woman
who
covers
her
shame
with
a
smile
the
vast
number
of
war
orders
from
abroad
had
brought
prosperity
into
homes
where
it
had
long
been
absent
mills
and
factories
took
on
new
life
labor
was
scarce
and
high
it
was
a
period
of
extravagance
rather
than
pleasure
people
played
that
they
might
not
think
washington
convinced
that
the
nation
would
ultimately
be
involved
kept
its
secret
well
and
continued
to
preach
a
neutrality
it
could
not
enforce
war
was
to
most
of
the
nation
a
great
dramatic
spectacle
presented
to
them
at
breakfast
and
in
the
afternoon
editions
it
furnished
unlimited
conversation
at
led
to
endless
wrangles
gave
zest
and
point
to
the
peace
that
made
those
dinner
parties
possible
furnished
an
excuse
for
retrenchment
here
and
there
and
brought
into
vogue
great
bazaars
and
balls
for
the
red
cross
and
kindred
activities
but
although
the
war
was
in
the
nation
mind
it
was
not
yet
in
its
soul
life
went
on
much
as
before
an
abiding
faith
in
the
allies
was
the
foundation
stone
of
its
complacency
the
great
battle
of
the
somme
with
its
million
casualties
was
resulting
favorably
on
the
east
the
russians
had
made
some
gains
there
were
wagers
that
the
germans
would
be
done
in
the
spring
but
again
washington
knew
that
the
british
and
french
losses
at
the
somme
had
been
frightful
that
the
amount
of
lost
territory
regained
was
negligible
as
against
the
territory
still
held
that
the
food
problem
in
the
british
islands
was
acute
that
the
submarine
sinkings
were
colossal
our
peace
was
at
a
fearful
cost
and
on
the
edge
of
this
volcano
america
played
when
graham
spencer
left
the
mill
that
tuesday
afternoon
it
was
to
visit
marion
hayden
he
was
rather
bored
now
at
the
prospect
he
would
have
preferred
going
to
the
club
to
play
billiards
which
was
his
custom
of
a
late
afternoon
he
drove
rather
more
slowly
than
was
his
custom
and
so
missed
marion
invitation
to
get
there
before
the
crowd
three
cars
before
the
house
showed
that
she
already
had
callers
and
indeed
when
the
opened
the
door
a
burst
of
laughter
greeted
him
the
hayden
house
was
a
general
rendezvous
there
were
usually
by
seven
glasses
and
on
most
of
the
furniture
and
cigarets
on
everything
that
would
hold
them
including
the
piano
marion
herself
met
him
in
the
hall
and
led
him
past
the
door
there
are
people
in
every
room
who
want
to
be
left
alone
she
volunteered
i
kept
the
library
as
long
as
i
could
we
can
sit
on
the
stairs
if
you
which
they
proceeded
to
do
quite
amiably
from
various
open
doors
came
subdued
voices
the
air
was
pungent
with
tobacco
smoke
permeated
with
a
faint
scent
of
late
afternoon
highballs
tommy
marion
called
when
she
had
settled
herself
yes
from
a
distance
did
you
leave
your
cigaret
on
the
piano
no
toots
dear
but
i
can
mother
marion
explained
is
getting
awfully
touchy
about
the
piano
well
do
you
remember
half
the
pretty
things
you
told
me
last
night
not
exactly
but
i
meant
he
looked
up
at
her
admiringly
he
was
only
a
year
from
college
and
he
had
been
rather
arbitrarily
limited
to
the
debutantes
he
found
therefore
something
rather
flattering
in
the
attention
he
was
receiving
from
a
girl
who
had
been
out
five
years
and
who
was
easily
the
most
popular
young
woman
in
the
gayer
set
it
gave
him
a
sense
of
maturity
since
the
night
before
he
had
been
rankling
under
a
sense
of
youth
was
i
pretty
awful
last
night
he
asked
you
were
very
interesting
and
i
imagine
rather
fine
what
did
i
say
you
boasted
my
dear
young
great
scott
i
must
have
been
about
the
new
war
oh
business
but
i
found
it
very
interesting
you
know
i
like
business
and
i
like
big
figures
poor
people
always
do
has
it
really
gone
through
i
mean
those
things
do
slip
up
sometimes
do
they
it
gone
through
all
right
signed
sealed
and
encouraged
by
her
interest
he
elaborated
on
the
new
work
he
even
developed
an
enthusiasm
for
it
to
his
own
surprise
and
the
girl
listened
intently
leaning
forward
so
that
her
arm
brushed
his
shoulder
her
eyes
slightly
narrowed
watched
him
closely
she
knew
every
move
of
the
game
she
was
determining
to
play
marion
hayden
at
knew
already
what
her
little
world
had
not
yet
realized
that
such
beauty
as
she
had
had
was
the
beauty
of
youth
only
and
that
that
was
going
late
hours
golf
perhaps
a
little
more
champagne
than
was
necessary
at
dinners
and
the
mornings
found
her
almost
plain
and
too
she
had
the
far
vision
of
the
calculating
mind
she
knew
that
if
the
country
entered
the
war
every
eligible
man
she
knew
would
immediately
volunteer
at
she
already
noticed
a
change
in
the
personnel
of
her
followers
the
unmarried
men
who
had
danced
with
her
during
her
first
two
winters
were
now
sending
flowers
to
the
debutantes
and
cutting
in
on
the
younger
men
at
balls
her
house
was
still
a
rendezvous
but
it
was
for
couples
like
the
ones
who
had
preempted
the
the
library
and
the
music
room
that
afternoon
they
met
there
smoked
her
cigarets
made
love
in
a
corner
occasionally
became
engaged
but
she
was
of
the
game
no
longer
in
it
men
still
came
to
see
her
a
growing
percentage
of
them
married
they
brought
or
sent
her
tribute
flowers
candy
and
cigarets
she
was
enormously
popular
at
dances
but
more
and
more
her
dinner
invitations
were
from
the
older
crowd
like
natalie
spencer
stupid
party
the
night
before
so
she
watched
graham
and
listened
he
was
a
nice
boy
and
a
handsome
one
also
he
promised
to
be
sole
heir
to
a
great
business
if
the
war
only
lasted
long
enough
imagine
your
knowing
all
those
things
she
said
admiringly
you
a
partner
are
you
he
flushed
slightly
not
yet
but
of
course
i
shall
when
you
really
get
going
i
wonder
if
you
will
take
me
round
and
show
me
how
shells
are
made
i
the
most
ignorant
person
you
ever
i
be
awfully
glad
very
well
for
that
promise
you
shall
have
a
highball
you
an
awful
dear
you
she
placed
a
slim
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
patted
it
then
leaning
rather
heavily
on
him
for
support
she
got
to
her
feet
we
go
in
and
stir
up
some
of
the
lovers
she
suggested
and
if
tommy
hale
has
burned
up
the
piano
we
can
dance
a
bit
you
dance
divinely
you
it
was
after
seven
when
he
reached
home
he
felt
every
inch
a
man
he
held
himself
very
straight
as
he
entered
the
house
and
the
boyish
grin
with
which
he
customarily
greeted
the
butler
had
given
place
to
a
dignified
nod
natalie
was
in
her
at
his
knock
she
told
the
maid
to
admit
him
and
threw
a
over
her
bare
shoulders
then
she
sent
the
maid
away
and
herself
cautiously
closed
the
door
into
room
i
got
the
money
for
you
darling
she
said
from
her
jewel
case
she
took
a
roll
of
bills
and
held
them
out
to
him
five
i
hate
to
take
it
never
mind
about
taking
it
pay
those
bills
before
your
father
learns
about
them
that
he
was
divided
between
gratitude
and
indignation
his
maturity
seemed
to
be
slipping
from
him
somehow
here
at
home
they
always
managed
to
make
him
feel
like
a
small
boy
honestly
mother
i
rather
go
to
father
and
tell
him
about
it
make
a
row
probably
but
at
least
you
be
out
of
she
ignored
his
protest
as
she
always
ignored
protests
against
her
own
methods
of
handling
matters
i
accustomed
to
it
was
her
sole
reply
but
her
resigned
voice
brought
her
as
it
always
had
the
ready
tribute
of
the
boy
sympathy
sit
down
graham
i
want
to
talk
to
he
sat
down
still
uneasily
fingering
the
roll
of
bills
just
how
far
natalie
methods
threatened
to
undermine
his
character
was
revealed
when
at
a
sound
in
clayton
room
he
stuck
the
money
hastily
into
his
pocket
have
you
noticed
a
change
in
your
father
since
he
came
back
her
tone
was
so
ominous
that
he
started
he
not
sick
is
he
not
that
but
he
different
graham
your
father
thinks
we
may
be
forced
into
the
good
for
us
it
time
that
graham
why
good
heavens
mother
he
began
we
should
have
been
in
it
last
may
we
should
she
was
holding
out
both
hands
to
him
piteously
you
would
go
would
you
i
might
have
to
go
he
evaded
you
would
graham
you
all
i
have
all
i
have
left
to
live
for
you
would
need
to
go
it
ridiculous
you
needed
here
your
father
needs
he
needs
me
the
hell
of
a
lot
the
boy
muttered
but
he
went
over
and
stooping
down
kissed
her
trembling
face
do
worry
about
me
he
said
lightly
i
do
think
we
got
spine
enough
to
get
into
the
anyhow
and
if
we
have
you
wo
go
promise
me
you
wo
when
he
hesitated
she
resorted
to
her
old
methods
with
both
clayton
and
the
boy
she
was
doing
all
she
could
to
make
them
happy
she
made
no
demands
none
but
when
she
asked
for
something
that
meant
more
than
life
to
her
it
was
refused
of
course
she
had
gone
through
all
sorts
of
humiliation
to
get
him
that
money
and
this
was
the
gratitude
she
received
graham
listened
she
was
a
really
pathetic
figure
crouched
in
her
low
chair
and
shaken
with
terror
she
must
have
rather
a
bad
time
there
were
so
many
things
she
dared
not
take
to
his
father
she
brought
them
to
him
instead
her
small
grievances
her
elaborate
extravagances
her
disappointments
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
she
transferred
to
his
young
shoulders
many
of
her
own
burdens
he
was
only
grateful
for
her
confidence
and
a
trifle
bewildered
by
it
and
she
had
helped
him
out
of
a
hole
just
now
all
right
i
promise
he
said
at
last
but
you
worrying
yourself
for
nothing
she
was
quite
content
then
cheered
at
once
consulted
the
jewelled
watch
on
her
dressing
table
and
rang
for
the
maid
heavens
how
late
it
is
she
exclaimed
run
out
now
dear
and
graham
tell
buckham
to
do
up
a
dozen
in
paper
audrey
valentine
has
telephoned
that
she
has
just
got
in
and
finds
she
enough
if
that
is
like
her
chapter
vi
months
afterward
clayton
spencer
looking
back
realized
that
the
night
of
the
dinner
at
the
chris
valentines
marked
the
beginning
of
a
new
epoch
for
him
yet
he
never
quite
understood
what
it
was
that
had
caused
the
change
all
that
was
clear
was
that
in
retrospect
he
always
commenced
with
that
evening
when
he
was
trying
to
trace
his
own
course
through
the
months
that
followed
with
their
various
changes
to
the
momentous
ones
of
the
following
summer
everything
pertaining
to
the
dinner
save
the
food
stood
out
with
odd
distinctness
natalie
silence
during
the
drive
broken
only
by
his
few
questions
and
her
brief
replies
had
the
place
looked
well
very
and
was
the
planting
going
on
all
right
she
supposed
so
he
had
hesitated
rather
discouraged
then
i
do
want
to
spoil
your
pleasure
in
the
place
natalie
he
had
said
rather
awkwardly
after
all
you
will
be
there
more
than
i
shall
you
better
have
it
the
way
you
like
she
had
appeared
mollified
at
that
and
had
relaxed
somewhat
he
fancied
that
the
silence
that
followed
was
no
longer
resentful
that
she
was
busily
planning
but
when
they
had
almost
reached
the
house
she
turned
to
him
please
do
talk
war
all
evening
clay
she
said
i
so
ghastly
sick
of
all
right
he
agreed
amiably
of
course
i
ca
prevent
the
others
doing
it
generally
you
who
lead
up
to
it
ever
since
you
came
back
bored
everybody
to
death
with
sorry
he
said
rather
stiffly
i
be
he
had
a
wretched
feeling
that
she
was
probably
right
he
had
come
back
so
full
of
new
impressions
that
he
had
probably
overflowed
with
them
it
was
a
very
formal
extremely
tall
and
reticent
clayton
spencer
who
greeted
audrey
that
night
afterward
he
remembered
that
audrey
was
not
quite
her
usual
frivolous
self
that
evening
but
perhaps
that
was
only
in
retrospect
in
view
of
what
he
learned
later
she
was
very
daringly
dressed
as
usual
wearing
a
very
low
gown
and
a
long
chain
and
of
black
opals
and
as
usual
all
the
men
in
the
room
were
grouped
around
her
thank
heaven
for
one
dignified
man
she
exclaimed
looking
up
at
him
clayton
you
do
give
tone
to
my
it
was
not
until
they
went
in
to
dinner
that
he
missed
chris
he
heard
audrey
giving
his
excuses
he
been
called
out
of
town
she
said
clay
you
to
have
his
place
and
the
flowers
are
low
so
i
can
look
across
and
admire
there
were
a
dozen
guests
and
things
moved
rapidly
audrey
dinners
were
always
hilarious
and
audrey
herself
clayton
perceived
from
his
place
of
vantage
was
flirting
almost
riotously
with
the
man
on
her
left
she
had
two
high
spots
of
color
in
her
cheeks
and
clayton
fancied
or
was
that
in
retrospect
too
that
her
gayety
was
rather
forced
once
he
caught
her
eyes
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
trying
to
convey
something
to
him
and
then
of
course
the
talk
turned
to
the
war
and
he
caught
a
flash
of
irritation
on
natalie
face
ask
the
oracle
said
audrey
clear
voice
ask
clay
he
knows
all
there
is
to
i
did
hear
it
but
i
suppose
it
is
when
the
war
will
end
amazing
perspicacity
some
one
said
i
can
only
give
you
my
own
opinion
ten
years
if
we
do
go
in
possibly
four
if
we
there
were
clamors
of
dissent
none
of
them
can
hold
out
so
if
we
go
in
it
will
end
in
six
nonsense
the
allies
are
victorious
now
i
only
gave
an
opinion
he
protested
one
man
guess
is
just
as
good
as
another
all
i
contend
is
that
it
is
going
on
to
a
finish
the
french
and
english
are
not
going
to
stop
until
they
have
made
the
hun
pay
in
blood
for
what
he
has
cost
i
wish
i
were
a
man
audrey
said
suddenly
i
do
see
how
any
man
with
red
blood
in
his
veins
can
sit
still
and
not
take
a
gun
and
try
to
stop
it
sometimes
i
think
i
cut
off
my
hair
and
go
over
anyhow
i
only
got
one
accomplishment
i
can
shoot
i
like
to
sit
in
a
tree
somewhere
and
pick
them
off
the
butchers
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
not
so
much
at
the
words
as
at
the
fierceness
with
which
she
delivered
them
clayton
however
felt
that
she
was
in
earnest
and
liked
her
the
better
for
it
he
surmised
indeed
that
under
audrey
affectations
there
might
be
something
rather
fine
if
one
could
get
at
it
she
looked
around
the
table
coolly
appraising
every
man
there
look
at
us
she
said
here
we
sit
only
not
because
i
ca
afford
it
and
probably
yes
i
think
actually
every
man
at
this
table
is
more
or
less
making
money
out
of
it
all
there
clay
making
a
fortune
there
roddie
making
money
out
of
clay
here
am
i
serving
clayton
cigarets
i
do
know
why
i
pick
on
you
clay
the
rest
are
just
as
bad
you
the
most
conspicuous
natalie
evidently
felt
that
the
situation
required
saving
i
sure
we
all
send
money
over
she
protested
to
the
belgians
and
all
that
and
if
they
want
things
we
have
to
sell
oh
yes
i
know
all
that
audrey
broke
in
rather
wearily
i
know
we
the
saviors
of
the
belgians
and
we
given
a
lot
of
money
and
shiploads
of
clothes
but
we
not
stopping
the
war
and
it
got
to
be
stopped
clayton
watched
her
somehow
what
she
had
just
said
seemed
to
crystallize
much
that
he
had
been
feeling
the
damnable
butchery
ought
to
be
stopped
right
audrey
he
supported
her
i
give
up
every
prospect
i
have
if
the
thing
could
be
ended
he
meant
it
then
he
might
not
have
meant
it
entirely
or
the
day
after
but
he
meant
it
then
he
glanced
down
the
table
to
find
natalie
looking
at
him
with
cynical
amusement
the
talk
veered
then
but
still
focused
on
the
war
it
became
abstract
as
was
so
much
of
the
war
talk
in
america
in
were
we
after
this
war
was
over
to
continue
to
use
the
inventions
of
science
to
destroy
mankind
or
for
its
welfare
would
we
ever
again
in
wars
to
come
go
back
to
the
comparative
humanity
of
the
hague
convention
were
such
wickednesses
as
the
use
of
poison
gas
the
spreading
of
disease
germs
and
the
killing
of
all
german
precedents
to
inaugurate
a
new
era
of
cruelty
in
warfare
was
this
the
last
war
would
there
ever
be
a
last
war
would
there
not
always
be
outlaw
nations
as
there
are
outlaw
individuals
would
there
ever
be
a
league
of
nations
to
enforce
peace
from
that
to
christianity
it
had
failed
on
the
contrary
there
was
a
great
revival
of
religious
faith
creeds
no
belief
yes
too
many
men
were
dying
to
permit
the
growth
of
any
skepticism
as
to
a
future
life
we
must
have
it
or
go
mad
in
the
midst
of
that
discussion
audrey
rose
her
color
had
faded
and
her
smile
was
gone
i
wo
listen
any
longer
she
said
i
ready
to
talk
about
fighting
but
not
about
clayton
was
conscious
that
he
had
had
in
spite
of
audrey
speech
about
the
wine
rather
more
to
drink
than
he
should
have
he
was
not
at
all
drunk
but
a
certain
excitement
had
taken
the
curb
off
his
tongue
after
the
departure
of
the
women
he
found
himself
rather
to
his
own
surprise
delivering
a
harangue
on
the
germans
liars
and
cheats
he
said
and
was
conscious
of
the
undivided
attention
of
the
men
they
lied
when
they
signed
the
hague
convention
they
lie
when
they
claim
that
they
wanted
peace
not
war
they
lie
when
they
claim
the
by
the
allies
of
the
red
cross
they
lie
to
the
world
and
they
lie
to
themselves
and
their
peace
offers
will
be
lies
always
then
conscious
that
the
table
was
eying
him
curiously
he
subsided
into
silence
you
a
dangerous
person
clay
somebody
said
you
the
kind
who
develops
a
sort
of
general
hate
and
will
force
the
president
hand
if
he
can
you
too
old
to
go
yourself
but
you
willing
to
send
a
million
or
two
boys
over
there
to
fight
a
war
that
is
still
none
of
our
i
got
a
son
clayton
said
sharply
and
suddenly
remembered
natalie
he
would
want
to
boast
she
had
said
that
he
had
a
son
in
the
army
good
god
was
he
doing
it
already
he
subsided
into
the
watchful
silence
of
a
man
not
entirely
sure
of
himself
he
took
no
liquor
and
with
his
coffee
he
was
entirely
himself
again
but
he
was
having
a
reaction
he
felt
a
sort
of
contemptuous
scorn
for
the
talk
at
the
table
the
guard
down
they
were
either
mouthing
flamboyant
patriotism
or
attacking
the
government
it
had
done
too
much
it
had
done
too
little
voices
raised
faces
flushed
they
wrangled
protested
accused
and
the
nation
he
reflected
was
like
that
divided
apparently
hopelessly
was
there
anything
that
would
unite
it
as
for
instance
france
was
united
would
even
war
do
it
our
problem
was
much
greater
more
complicated
we
were
of
every
race
and
the
country
was
founded
and
had
grown
by
men
who
had
fled
from
the
quarrels
of
europe
they
had
come
to
find
peace
was
there
any
humanitarian
principle
in
the
world
strong
enough
to
force
them
to
relinquish
that
peace
clayton
found
audrey
in
the
hall
as
they
moved
at
last
toward
the
he
was
the
last
of
the
line
of
men
and
as
he
paused
before
her
she
touched
him
lightly
on
the
arm
i
want
to
talk
to
you
clay
unless
you
going
to
i
rather
not
unless
you
need
i
do
i
not
playing
either
and
i
must
talk
to
some
there
was
something
wrong
with
audrey
her
usual
insouciance
was
gone
and
her
hands
nervously
fingered
the
opal
beads
of
her
long
necklace
what
i
really
want
to
do
she
added
is
to
scream
but
do
look
like
that
i
sha
do
it
suppose
we
go
up
to
chris
she
was
always
a
casual
hostess
having
got
her
parties
together
and
having
fed
them
well
she
consistently
declined
further
responsibility
she
kept
open
house
her
side
board
and
her
servants
at
the
call
of
her
friends
but
she
was
quite
capable
of
withdrawing
herself
without
explanation
once
things
were
moving
well
to
be
found
later
by
some
one
who
was
leaving
writing
letters
fussing
with
her
endless
bills
or
sending
a
check
she
could
not
possibly
afford
to
some
one
in
want
whom
she
happened
to
have
heard
about
her
popularity
was
founded
on
something
more
substantial
than
her
dinners
clayton
was
liking
audrey
better
that
night
than
he
had
ever
liked
her
though
even
now
he
did
not
entirely
approve
of
her
and
to
the
call
of
any
woman
in
trouble
he
always
responded
it
occurred
to
him
following
her
up
the
stairs
that
not
only
was
something
wrong
with
audrey
but
that
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
known
her
to
show
weakness
chris
study
was
dark
she
groped
her
way
in
and
turned
on
the
lamp
and
then
turned
and
faced
him
i
in
an
awful
mess
clay
she
said
and
the
worst
of
it
is
i
know
just
what
sort
of
a
mess
it
are
you
going
to
tell
me
about
it
some
of
it
and
if
i
do
start
to
yelling
like
a
you
not
going
to
do
that
let
me
get
you
he
was
terrified
by
her
eyes
some
aromatic
that
was
natalie
cure
for
everything
i
not
going
to
faint
i
never
do
close
the
door
and
sit
down
and
then
give
me
a
hundred
dollars
if
you
have
it
will
you
is
that
enough
he
asked
and
drew
out
his
black
silk
evening
wallet
with
its
monogram
in
seed
pearls
he
laid
the
money
on
her
knee
for
she
made
no
move
to
take
it
she
sat
back
her
face
colorless
and
surveyed
him
intently
what
a
comfort
you
are
clay
she
said
not
a
word
in
question
just
like
that
yet
you
know
i
do
borrow
money
the
only
thing
that
is
important
is
that
i
have
the
money
with
me
are
you
sure
it
enough
plenty
i
send
it
back
in
a
week
or
so
i
selling
this
house
practically
sold
i
do
know
why
anybody
wants
it
it
a
poky
little
place
but
well
it
does
matter
about
the
house
i
called
up
some
people
who
have
been
wanting
one
in
this
neighborhood
and
practically
sure
they
take
but
you
and
chris
we
have
separated
clay
at
least
chris
has
gone
there
a
long
story
behind
it
i
not
up
to
telling
it
and
this
money
will
end
part
of
it
that
all
i
going
to
tell
about
the
money
it
a
small
sum
is
it
to
break
up
a
family
why
it
absurd
it
it
horrible
oh
it
is
the
money
that
a
trifle
i
just
had
to
have
it
quickly
and
when
i
learned
i
needed
it
of
course
the
banks
were
closed
besides
i
fancy
chris
had
to
have
all
there
clayton
was
puzzled
and
distressed
he
had
not
liked
chris
he
had
hated
his
cynicism
his
pose
of
indifference
his
very
fastidiousness
had
never
seemed
entirely
genuine
and
this
going
away
and
taking
all
audrey
small
reserve
of
money
where
is
he
i
do
know
i
believe
on
his
way
to
do
you
mean
oh
no
he
did
steal
anything
he
going
to
enlist
in
the
canadian
army
or
he
said
so
when
he
look
here
audrey
you
ca
tell
me
only
part
of
the
story
do
you
mean
to
say
that
chris
has
had
a
magnificent
impulse
and
gone
to
fight
or
that
he
running
away
from
something
both
said
audrey
i
tell
you
this
much
clay
chris
has
got
himself
into
a
scrape
i
wo
tell
you
about
that
because
after
all
that
his
story
and
i
not
asking
for
sympathy
if
you
dare
to
pity
me
i
cry
and
i
never
forgive
why
did
he
stay
and
face
it
like
a
man
not
leave
you
to
face
because
the
only
person
it
greatly
concerned
was
myself
he
did
want
to
face
me
the
thing
that
is
driving
me
almost
mad
is
that
he
may
be
killed
over
there
not
because
i
love
him
so
much
i
think
you
know
how
things
have
been
but
because
he
went
to
well
i
think
to
reinstate
himself
in
my
esteem
to
show
me
he
a
man
after
good
heavens
audrey
and
you
went
through
dinner
with
all
this
to
bear
i
got
to
carry
it
right
along
have
i
you
know
how
i
been
about
this
war
clay
i
talked
and
talked
about
wondering
how
our
men
could
stay
out
of
it
so
when
the
smash
came
he
just
said
he
was
going
he
would
show
me
there
was
some
good
stuff
in
him
still
you
see
really
driven
him
to
it
and
if
he
killed
a
surge
of
resentment
against
the
absent
man
rose
in
clayton
mind
how
like
the
cynicism
of
chris
whole
attitude
that
he
should
thrust
the
responsibility
for
his
going
onto
audrey
he
had
made
her
unhappy
while
he
was
with
her
and
now
his
death
if
it
occurred
would
be
a
horror
to
her
i
do
know
why
i
burden
you
with
all
this
she
said
rather
impatiently
i
daresay
it
is
because
i
knew
you
have
the
money
no
i
do
mean
that
i
rather
go
to
you
in
trouble
than
to
any
one
else
that
i
hope
you
always
oh
i
shall
do
but
her
attempt
at
gayety
fell
flat
she
lighted
a
cigaret
from
the
stand
beside
her
and
fell
to
studying
his
face
what
happened
to
you
she
asked
there
a
change
in
you
somehow
i
noticed
it
ever
since
you
came
home
you
ought
to
be
smug
and
contented
if
any
man
should
but
you
not
are
you
i
working
hard
that
all
i
do
want
to
talk
about
myself
he
added
impatiently
what
about
you
what
are
you
going
to
do
sell
my
house
pay
my
debts
and
live
on
my
own
little
bit
of
an
but
good
heavens
audrey
chris
has
no
right
to
cut
off
like
this
and
leave
you
i
do
know
the
story
but
at
least
he
must
support
you
a
man
ca
just
run
away
and
evade
every
obligation
i
think
i
have
to
go
after
him
and
give
him
a
talking
no
she
said
bending
forward
do
do
that
he
has
had
a
bad
scare
but
he
had
one
decent
impulse
too
let
him
alone
she
placed
the
money
on
the
stand
and
rose
as
she
faced
him
she
impulsively
placed
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
clay
she
said
in
her
low
slightly
husky
voice
how
very
very
much
i
admire
you
you
pretty
much
of
a
man
you
know
and
there
are
such
a
lot
of
for
an
uneasy
moment
he
thought
she
was
going
to
kiss
him
but
she
let
her
hands
fall
and
smiling
faintly
led
the
way
downstairs
once
down
however
she
voiced
the
under
lying
thought
in
her
mind
if
he
comes
out
clay
he
never
forgive
me
probably
and
if
he
is
if
he
does
i
never
forgive
myself
so
i
damned
either
but
ten
minutes
later
with
a
man
on
either
side
of
her
she
was
sitting
at
the
piano
with
a
cigaret
tucked
behind
her
ear
looking
distractingly
pretty
and
very
gay
and
singing
a
slightly
indecorous
but
very
witty
little
french
song
clayton
spencer
cutting
in
on
the
second
rubber
wondered
which
of
the
many
he
knew
was
the
real
audrey
he
wondered
if
chris
had
not
married
for
instance
the
girl
at
the
piano
only
to
find
she
was
the
woman
upstairs
and
he
wondered
too
if
that
were
true
why
he
should
have
had
to
clear
out
so
many
men
married
the
sort
audrey
had
been
in
chris
little
study
only
to
find
that
after
all
the
thing
they
had
thought
they
were
getting
was
a
pose
and
it
was
the
girl
at
the
piano
after
all
he
missed
her
somewhat
later
she
was
gone
a
full
half
hour
and
he
fancied
her
absence
had
something
to
do
with
the
money
she
had
borrowed
chapter
vii
two
things
helped
greatly
to
restore
clayton
to
a
more
normal
state
of
mind
during
the
next
few
days
one
of
them
undoubtedly
was
the
valentine
situation
beside
audrey
predicament
and
chris
wretched
endeavor
to
get
away
and
yet
prove
himself
a
man
his
own
position
seemed
if
not
comfortable
at
least
tenable
he
would
have
described
it
had
he
been
a
man
to
put
such
a
thing
into
words
as
that
he
and
natalie
exactly
hit
it
there
were
times
too
during
those
next
few
days
when
he
wondered
if
he
had
not
exaggerated
their
incompatibility
natalie
was
unusually
pleasant
she
spent
some
evening
hours
on
the
arm
of
his
big
chair
talking
endlessly
about
the
linndale
house
and
he
would
lean
back
smiling
and
pretend
to
a
mad
interest
in
black
and
white
tiles
and
loggias
he
made
no
further
protest
as
to
the
expense
tell
me
he
said
once
what
does
a
fellow
wear
in
this
er
italian
palace
if
you
have
any
intention
of
draping
me
in
a
toga
and
putting
vine
leaves
in
my
hair
or
whatever
those
wreaths
were
made
of
natalie
had
no
sense
of
humor
however
she
saw
that
he
meant
to
be
amusing
and
she
gave
the
little
fleeting
smile
one
gives
to
a
child
who
is
being
rather
silly
of
course
he
went
on
we
have
roman
baths
and
be
anointed
with
oil
afterwards
by
lady
greek
slaves
perfumed
do
be
vulgar
and
he
saw
she
was
really
offended
while
there
was
actually
no
change
in
their
relationship
which
remained
as
it
had
been
for
a
dozen
years
their
surface
life
was
pleasanter
and
even
that
small
improvement
cheered
him
greatly
he
was
thankful
for
such
a
peace
even
when
he
knew
that
he
had
bought
it
at
a
heavy
price
the
other
was
his
work
the
directorate
for
the
new
munition
plant
had
been
selected
and
on
thursday
of
that
week
he
gave
a
dinner
at
his
club
to
the
directors
it
had
been
gratifying
to
him
to
find
how
easily
his
past
reputation
carried
the
matter
of
the
vast
credits
needed
how
absolutely
his
new
board
deferred
to
his
judgment
the
dinner
became
in
a
way
an
ovation
he
was
vastly
pleased
and
a
little
humbled
he
wanted
terribly
to
make
good
to
justify
their
faith
in
him
they
were
the
big
financial
men
of
his
time
and
they
were
agreeing
to
back
his
judgment
to
the
fullest
extent
when
the
dinner
was
over
a
few
of
the
younger
men
were
in
no
mood
to
go
home
they
had
dined
and
wined
and
the
night
was
young
denis
nolan
who
had
been
present
as
the
attorney
for
the
new
concern
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
listened
to
them
with
a
sort
of
tolerant
cynicism
oh
go
home
you
fellows
he
said
at
last
you
make
me
sick
enough
why
the
devil
does
every
dinner
like
this
have
to
end
in
a
debauch
in
the
end
however
both
he
and
clayton
went
along
clayton
at
least
frankly
anxious
to
keep
an
eye
on
one
or
two
of
them
until
they
started
home
he
had
the
usual
standards
of
course
except
for
himself
a
private
life
so
long
as
he
was
not
a
bounder
concerned
him
not
at
all
but
this
had
been
his
dinner
he
meant
to
see
it
through
once
or
twice
he
had
seen
real
tragedy
come
to
men
as
a
result
of
the
recklessness
of
long
dinners
many
toasts
and
the
instinct
to
go
on
and
make
a
night
of
it
afterward
they
went
to
a
midnight
and
at
first
it
was
rather
dreary
their
youth
was
only
comparative
after
all
and
the
eyes
of
the
girls
who
danced
and
sang
passed
over
them
to
rest
on
boys
in
their
twenties
nolan
chuckled
pathetic
he
said
the
saddest
sight
in
the
world
every
one
of
you
here
would
at
this
moment
give
up
everything
he
got
to
be
under
oh
shut
up
some
one
said
almost
savagely
of
course
there
are
compensations
he
drawled
at
twenty
you
want
to
take
the
entire
bunch
home
and
keep
at
thirty
you
know
you
ca
but
you
still
want
to
at
forty
and
over
you
do
want
them
at
all
but
you
think
it
damned
curious
they
do
want
clayton
had
watched
the
scene
with
a
rather
weary
interest
he
was
indeed
trying
to
put
himself
in
graham
place
at
graham
age
he
remembered
once
at
twenty
having
slipped
off
to
see
the
black
crook
then
the
epitome
of
wickedness
and
the
disillusionment
of
seeing
women
in
tights
with
their
accentuated
curves
and
hideous
lack
of
appeal
to
the
imagination
the
caterers
of
such
wares
had
learned
since
then
here
were
soft
draperies
instead
laces
and
chiffons
the
suggestion
was
not
to
the
eyes
but
to
the
mind
how
devilishly
clever
it
all
was
perhaps
there
were
some
things
he
ought
to
discuss
with
graham
he
wondered
how
a
man
led
up
to
such
a
thing
nolan
bent
toward
him
i
been
watching
for
a
girl
he
said
but
i
do
see
her
last
time
i
was
here
i
came
with
chris
she
was
his
chris
yes
it
stumped
me
at
first
she
came
and
sat
with
us
not
a
bad
little
thing
but
good
lord
clay
ignorant
and
not
even
pretty
and
chris
was
fastidious
in
a
way
i
do
understand
the
ancient
perplexity
of
a
man
over
the
sex
selections
of
his
friends
puckered
his
forehead
damned
if
i
understand
it
he
repeated
a
great
wave
of
pity
for
audrey
valentine
surged
in
clayton
heart
she
had
known
it
of
course
that
was
why
chris
had
gone
away
how
long
had
she
known
it
she
was
protecting
chris
name
even
now
for
all
her
frivolity
there
was
something
rather
big
in
audrey
the
way
she
had
held
up
at
her
dinner
for
instance
and
he
rather
fancied
that
the
idea
of
his
going
into
the
army
had
come
from
her
directly
or
indirectly
so
chris
from
being
a
fugitive
was
already
by
way
of
being
a
hero
to
his
friends
poor
audrey
he
made
a
mental
note
to
send
her
some
flowers
in
the
morning
he
ordered
them
on
his
way
and
for
some
curious
reason
she
was
in
his
mind
most
of
the
day
chris
had
been
a
fool
to
throw
away
a
thing
so
worth
having
not
every
man
had
behind
him
a
woman
of
sort
chapter
viii
that
afternoon
accompanied
by
a
rather
boyishly
excited
elderly
clergyman
he
took
two
hours
off
from
the
mill
and
purchased
a
new
car
for
doctor
haverford
the
rector
was
divided
between
pleasure
at
the
gift
and
apprehension
at
its
cost
but
clayton
having
determined
to
do
a
thing
always
did
it
well
nonsense
he
said
my
dear
man
the
church
has
owed
you
this
car
for
at
least
ten
years
if
you
get
half
the
pleasure
out
of
using
it
that
i
having
in
presenting
it
to
you
it
will
be
well
worth
while
i
only
wish
you
let
me
endow
the
thing
it
likely
to
cost
you
a
small
doctor
haverford
insisted
that
he
could
manage
that
he
stood
off
surveying
with
pride
not
unmixed
with
fear
its
bright
enamel
its
leather
linings
the
complicated
system
of
dials
and
bright
levers
which
filled
him
with
apprehension
delight
says
i
must
not
drive
it
he
said
she
is
sure
i
would
go
too
fast
and
run
into
things
she
is
going
to
drive
for
how
is
delight
i
wish
you
could
see
her
clayton
she
well
all
young
girls
are
lovely
but
sometimes
i
think
delight
is
lovelier
than
most
she
is
much
older
than
i
am
in
many
ways
she
looks
after
me
like
a
mother
but
she
has
humor
too
she
has
been
drawing
the
most
outrageous
pictures
of
me
arrested
for
speeding
and
she
has
warned
me
most
gravely
against
visiting
road
houses
but
delight
will
have
to
be
taught
if
she
is
to
run
the
the
salesman
says
they
will
send
some
they
give
one
lesson
i
believe
that
not
enough
i
think
graham
could
show
her
some
things
he
drives
flying
uptown
a
little
later
in
clayton
handsome
car
the
rector
dreamed
certain
dreams
first
his
mind
went
to
his
parish
visiting
list
so
endless
so
never
cleaned
up
and
now
about
to
be
made
a
pleasure
instead
of
a
penance
and
into
his
mind
so
strangely
compounded
of
worldliness
and
spirituality
came
a
further
dream
of
delight
and
graham
spencer
of
ease
at
last
for
the
girl
after
the
struggle
to
keep
up
appearances
of
a
clergyman
family
in
a
wealthy
parish
money
had
gradually
assumed
an
undue
importance
in
his
mind
every
sunday
every
service
he
dealt
in
money
he
reminded
his
people
of
the
church
debt
he
begged
for
various
charities
he
tried
hard
to
believe
that
the
money
that
came
in
was
given
to
the
lord
but
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
it
went
to
the
janitor
and
the
plumber
and
the
organist
he
watched
the
offertory
after
the
sermon
and
only
too
often
as
he
stood
waiting
before
raising
it
before
the
altar
he
wondered
if
the
people
felt
that
they
had
received
their
money
worth
he
had
started
life
with
a
dream
of
service
but
although
his
own
sturdy
faith
persisted
he
had
learned
the
cost
of
religion
in
dollars
and
cents
so
going
up
town
he
wondered
if
clayton
would
increase
his
church
subscription
now
that
things
were
well
with
him
after
all
he
reflected
war
is
not
an
unmixed
evil
and
outlined
a
sermon
to
be
called
the
gains
of
war
and
subsequently
reprinted
in
pamphlet
form
and
sold
for
the
benefit
of
the
new
altar
fund
he
instructed
jackson
to
drive
to
the
parish
house
instead
of
to
the
rectory
so
that
he
might
jot
down
the
headings
while
they
were
in
his
mind
they
ran
like
this
spiritual
growth
the
nobility
of
sacrifice
the
pursuit
of
an
ideal
the
doctrine
of
thy
brother
keeper
he
stopped
to
speak
to
jackson
from
the
pavement
i
daresay
we
shall
be
in
frequent
difficulties
with
that
new
car
of
ours
jackson
he
said
genially
i
may
have
to
ask
you
to
come
round
and
explain
some
of
its
mysterious
interior
to
jackson
touched
his
cap
thank
you
sir
i
be
glad
to
come
but
i
am
leaving
spencer
leaving
going
back
to
the
army
in
the
back
of
his
mind
the
rector
had
been
depending
on
jackson
and
he
felt
vaguely
irritated
i
sorry
to
hear
it
i
been
counting
on
very
sorry
sir
i
not
leaving
i
sometimes
think
observed
the
rector
still
ruffled
that
a
man
duty
is
not
always
what
it
appears
on
the
surface
to
keep
spencer
er
comfortable
while
he
is
doing
his
magnificent
work
for
the
allies
may
be
less
spectacular
but
it
is
most
jackson
smiled
a
restrained
and
slightly
cynical
smile
that
a
matter
for
a
man
conscience
is
it
sir
he
asked
and
touching
his
cap
again
moved
off
doctor
haverford
felt
reproved
worse
than
that
he
felt
justly
reproved
he
did
not
touch
the
gains
of
war
that
afternoon
in
the
gymnasium
he
found
delight
captaining
a
team
in
her
knickers
and
middy
blouse
she
looked
like
a
little
girl
and
he
stood
watching
her
as
flushed
and
excited
she
ran
round
the
long
room
at
last
she
came
over
and
dropped
onto
the
steps
at
his
feet
well
she
inquired
looking
up
did
you
get
it
i
did
indeed
a
beauty
a
flivver
not
at
all
a
very
handsome
he
told
her
the
make
and
she
flushed
again
with
pleasure
joy
and
rapture
she
said
did
you
warn
him
i
am
to
drive
it
i
did
he
suggests
that
graham
give
you
some
graham
why
not
he
be
bored
to
insanity
that
all
you
you
did
suggest
it
did
you
daddy
with
all
her
adoration
of
her
father
delight
had
long
recognized
under
his
real
spirituality
a
certain
quality
of
worldly
calculation
that
where
it
concerned
her
it
was
prompted
only
by
love
did
not
make
her
acceptance
of
it
easier
certainly
not
said
the
rector
stiffly
graham
changed
you
know
he
used
to
be
a
nice
little
kid
but
he
i
do
know
what
it
is
spoiled
i
he
steady
down
she
looked
up
at
him
with
clear
slightly
humorous
eyes
do
get
any
queer
ideas
about
graham
spencer
and
me
daddy
she
said
in
the
first
place
i
intend
to
choose
my
own
husband
he
to
look
as
much
as
possible
like
you
but
a
trifle
less
nose
and
in
the
second
place
after
i
backed
the
car
into
a
telegraph
pole
and
turned
it
over
in
a
ditch
graham
spencer
is
just
naturally
going
to
know
i
am
no
woman
to
tie
she
got
up
and
smiled
at
him
anyhow
i
would
trust
him
with
the
communion
service
she
added
and
walking
out
onto
the
floor
blew
shrilly
on
her
whistle
the
rector
watched
her
with
growing
indignation
these
snap
judgments
of
youth
the
easy
damning
of
the
young
they
left
no
room
for
argument
they
condemned
and
walked
away
leaving
careful
plans
in
ruin
behind
them
and
delight
having
gone
so
far
went
further
she
announced
that
evening
at
dinner
that
she
would
under
no
circumstances
be
instructed
by
graham
spencer
her
mother
ventured
remonstrance
the
way
to
learn
to
drive
a
car
said
delight
is
to
get
into
it
and
press
a
few
things
and
when
it
starts
keep
on
going
you
got
to
work
it
out
for
and
when
clayton
calling
up
with
his
usual
thoughtfulness
that
evening
offered
graham
as
instructor
she
refused
gratefully
but
firmly
you
a
dear
to
think
of
it
she
said
and
you
a
dear
to
have
given
daddy
the
car
but
i
just
naturally
going
to
fight
it
out
in
my
own
way
if
it
takes
all
natalie
gathering
her
refusal
from
clayton
protest
had
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
not
that
she
objected
to
delight
haverford
she
liked
her
as
much
as
she
liked
and
understood
any
young
girl
which
was
very
little
but
she
did
not
want
graham
to
marry
to
marry
would
be
to
lose
him
and
again
watching
clayton
handsome
head
above
his
newspaper
she
reflected
that
graham
was
all
she
had
nevertheless
delight
received
a
lesson
in
driving
from
graham
and
that
within
two
days
on
saturday
afternoon
finding
the
mill
getting
on
his
nerves
clayton
suggested
to
graham
what
might
be
the
last
golf
of
the
autumn
and
graham
consented
cheerfully
enough
for
one
thing
the
offices
closed
at
noon
and
anna
klein
had
gone
he
was
playing
a
little
game
with
anna
a
matter
of
a
glance
now
and
then
caught
and
held
a
touched
hand
very
casually
done
and
an
admiring
comment
now
and
then
on
her
work
and
anna
was
blossoming
like
a
flower
she
sat
up
late
to
make
fresh
white
blouses
for
the
office
and
rose
early
to
have
abundance
of
time
to
dress
she
had
taken
to
using
a
touch
of
rouge
too
although
she
put
it
on
after
she
reached
the
mill
and
took
it
off
before
she
started
for
home
her
father
sullen
and
irritable
these
days
would
have
probably
beaten
her
for
using
it
but
anna
had
gone
and
a
telephone
call
to
marion
hayden
had
told
him
she
was
not
at
home
he
thought
it
possible
she
had
gone
to
the
country
club
and
accepted
his
father
suggestion
of
golf
willingly
from
the
moment
he
left
the
mill
anna
had
left
his
mind
he
was
at
that
period
when
always
in
the
back
of
his
mind
there
was
a
girl
during
the
mill
hours
the
girl
was
anna
because
she
was
there
in
the
afternoon
it
was
marion
just
then
but
even
at
that
there
were
entire
evenings
when
at
the
theater
a
pretty
girl
in
the
chorus
held
and
absorbed
his
entire
attention
or
at
a
dance
a
debutante
cloudy
and
mysterious
in
white
chiffon
bounded
his
universe
for
a
few
hours
on
this
foundation
of
girl
he
built
the
superstructure
of
his
days
not
evil
but
wholly
irresponsible
the
urge
of
vital
youth
had
caught
him
and
held
him
and
clayton
sitting
that
day
beside
him
in
the
car
while
graham
drove
and
the
golf
clubs
rattled
in
their
bags
at
his
feet
remembered
again
the
impulses
of
his
own
adolescence
and
wondered
there
had
been
a
time
when
he
would
have
gone
to
the
boy
frankly
with
the
anxieties
he
was
beginning
to
feel
there
were
so
many
things
he
wanted
to
tell
the
boy
so
many
warnings
he
should
have
but
natalie
had
stolen
him
that
was
what
it
amounted
to
she
had
stolen
his
confidence
as
only
a
selfish
woman
could
and
against
that
cabal
of
mother
and
son
he
felt
helpless
it
was
even
more
than
that
as
against
natalie
indulgence
he
did
not
wish
to
pose
as
a
mentor
pointing
out
always
the
way
of
duty
how
old
are
you
graham
he
said
suddenly
graham
glanced
at
him
curiously
his
father
knew
his
age
of
course
i
was
married
at
your
tough
luck
said
graham
and
then
i
sorry
father
i
did
mean
that
but
it
pretty
early
is
it
no
time
for
a
good
time
or
i
fancy
nature
meant
men
to
marry
young
do
you
it
saves
a
lot
of
the
girl
a
fellow
marries
at
that
age
is
often
the
one
he
marry
at
thirty
said
graham
and
feeling
that
he
had
said
the
wrong
thing
changed
the
subject
quickly
clayton
did
not
try
to
turn
it
back
into
its
former
channel
the
boy
was
uncomfortable
unresponsive
there
was
a
barrier
between
them
of
on
his
part
of
evasion
and
discomfort
on
graham
on
the
way
over
they
had
sighted
delight
in
the
new
car
she
had
tried
to
turn
had
backed
into
a
ditch
and
was
at
that
moment
ruefully
surveying
a
machine
which
had
apparently
sat
down
on
its
rear
wheels
with
its
engine
pointed
pathetically
skyward
delight
face
fell
when
she
recognized
them
of
course
it
would
have
to
be
you
she
said
of
all
the
people
who
might
have
seen
my
shame
i
going
on
with
you
i
never
want
to
see
the
old
thing
anything
smashed
graham
inquired
it
looks
smashed
i
ca
it
was
not
until
the
car
was
out
of
the
ditch
and
clayton
had
driven
off
in
graham
car
toward
the
club
that
delight
remembered
her
voice
the
day
he
had
told
her
graham
would
teach
her
to
drive
she
stiffened
and
he
was
quick
to
see
the
change
in
her
manner
the
total
damage
was
one
flat
tire
and
while
the
engine
was
inflating
it
he
looked
at
her
she
had
grown
to
be
quite
pretty
his
eyes
approved
her
better
let
me
come
round
and
give
you
a
few
lessons
i
rather
learn
by
myself
if
you
do
you
have
a
real
smash
unless
you
learn
but
she
remained
rather
obstinately
silent
what
the
matter
with
me
delight
you
not
exactly
crazy
about
me
are
you
that
silly
i
do
know
anything
about
you
any
that
your
fault
you
know
i
been
away
for
four
years
and
since
i
came
back
i
have
seen
much
of
you
but
if
you
let
me
come
round
you
can
come
if
you
like
you
be
bored
you
being
awfully
nasty
you
know
here
i
come
to
pull
you
out
of
a
ditch
and
generally
rescue
you
and
come
now
delight
what
is
it
there
something
we
used
to
be
i
do
know
graham
she
said
truthfully
i
only
know
well
i
hear
things
of
course
nothing
very
bad
just
little
things
i
wish
you
would
insist
it
idiotic
what
does
it
matter
what
i
think
graham
flushed
he
knew
well
enough
one
thing
she
had
heard
her
father
and
mother
had
been
at
dinner
the
other
night
and
he
had
had
too
much
to
drink
he
stopped
the
pump
and
put
away
the
tools
all
in
silence
good
heavens
was
all
the
world
divided
into
two
sorts
of
people
the
knockers
and
under
that
heading
he
placed
his
father
delight
and
all
those
who
occasionally
disapproved
of
him
and
the
decent
sort
who
liked
a
fellow
and
understood
him
but
his
training
had
been
too
good
to
permit
him
to
show
his
angry
scorn
he
made
an
effort
and
summoned
a
smile
all
ready
he
said
and
since
you
wo
let
me
teach
you
perhaps
better
take
you
you
were
going
to
the
oh
that
all
right
father
probably
found
some
but
she
insisted
that
he
drive
them
both
to
the
club
and
turn
the
car
round
there
then
with
a
grinding
of
gear
levers
that
made
him
groan
she
was
off
toward
home
leaving
graham
staring
after
her
well
can
you
beat
it
he
inquired
of
the
empty
air
can
you
beat
it
and
wounded
in
all
the
pride
of
new
manhood
he
joined
marion
and
her
rather
riotous
crowd
around
the
fire
inside
the
clubhouse
clayton
had
given
him
up
and
was
going
around
alone
followed
by
a
small
caddie
the
links
were
empty
and
the
caddie
lonely
he
ventured
small
bits
of
conversation
now
and
then
looking
up
with
admiration
at
clayton
tall
figure
and
after
a
little
clayton
took
the
bag
from
him
and
used
him
only
for
retrieving
balls
the
boy
played
round
whistling
kinda
quiet
ai
it
he
offered
trudging
a
foot
or
two
behind
it
is
rather
young
mostly
on
saturdays
i
caddie
for
valentine
but
he
gone
to
the
oh
he
has
has
he
clayton
built
a
small
tee
and
placed
his
ball
on
it
well
maybe
we
all
be
going
some
he
drove
off
and
started
after
the
ball
it
was
not
until
he
was
on
the
green
that
he
was
conscious
of
the
boy
beside
him
again
how
old
have
to
be
to
get
into
the
army
spencer
inquired
the
caddie
anxiously
clayton
looked
at
him
quizzically
want
to
try
for
it
do
you
well
i
afraid
you
have
to
wait
a
i
older
than
i
look
how
old
are
you
afraid
you
have
to
wait
a
while
said
clayton
and
achieved
a
perfect
long
putt
i
just
like
to
get
a
whack
at
them
germans
offered
the
boy
and
getting
no
response
trudged
along
again
at
his
heels
suddenly
it
struck
clayton
as
rather
strange
that
in
all
the
time
since
his
return
from
europe
only
four
people
had
shown
any
but
a
sort
of
academic
interest
in
the
war
and
that
ironically
enough
a
german
had
been
the
first
to
make
a
sacrifice
for
principle
chris
had
gone
to
get
out
of
trouble
the
little
caddie
wanted
to
go
to
get
a
whack
at
the
madmen
of
europe
and
jackson
the
chauffeur
was
going
giving
up
his
excellent
wages
to
accept
the
dollars
a
month
of
a
from
a
pure
sense
of
responsibility
but
among
the
men
he
knew
best
in
business
and
in
the
clubs
the
war
still
remained
a
magnificent
spectacle
a
daily
newspaper
drama
suddenly
clayton
saw
audrey
valentine
she
was
swinging
toward
him
her
bag
with
its
clubs
slung
over
her
shoulder
her
hands
in
the
pockets
of
an
sweater
in
her
black
velvet
tam
and
short
skirt
she
had
looked
like
a
little
girl
and
at
first
he
did
not
recognize
her
she
had
seen
him
however
and
swung
toward
him
hello
clay
she
called
when
they
were
within
hailing
distance
bully
shot
that
where
your
caddie
i
did
want
one
i
had
a
feeling
that
if
i
took
one
and
he
lost
a
ball
in
these
impecunious
times
of
mine
i
murder
him
saw
you
at
the
fifth
hole
i
know
your
silhouette
under
her
rakish
cap
her
eyes
were
rather
defiant
she
did
not
want
pity
she
almost
dared
him
to
pity
her
come
round
again
with
me
audrey
wo
you
i
off
my
game
i
wander
along
if
you
do
mind
probably
sneeze
or
something
when
you
driving
of
nothing
he
said
gravely
approaching
his
ball
so
adds
distance
to
my
drive
as
a
good
explosive
sneeze
just
behind
they
talked
very
little
audrey
whistled
as
she
walked
along
with
the
free
swinging
step
that
was
characteristic
of
her
and
clayton
was
satisfied
merely
to
have
her
companionship
she
was
not
like
some
women
a
man
did
have
to
be
paying
her
compliments
or
making
love
to
her
she
even
made
no
comments
on
his
shots
and
after
a
time
that
rather
annoyed
him
well
he
demanded
after
an
excellent
putt
was
that
good
or
it
very
good
she
said
gravely
i
am
only
surprised
when
you
do
a
thing
badly
not
when
you
do
it
he
thought
that
over
have
you
anything
in
mind
that
i
do
badly
i
mean
particularly
in
not
very
but
after
a
moment
why
do
you
make
natalie
play
golf
she
hates
he
rather
wondered
if
she
thought
natalie
was
one
of
the
things
he
managed
badly
the
sense
of
companionship
warmed
him
although
neither
of
them
realized
it
their
mutual
loneliness
and
dissatisfaction
had
brought
them
together
and
mentally
at
least
they
were
clinging
each
desperately
to
the
other
but
their
talk
was
disjointed
i
return
that
hundred
soon
i
sold
the
i
wish
you
would
worry
about
it
it
ridiculous
and
a
hundred
yards
or
so
further
on
they
would
have
chris
in
canada
his
heart
he
going
into
the
french
ambulance
good
for
but
she
came
out
very
frankly
when
they
started
back
to
the
clubhouse
it
done
me
a
lot
of
good
meeting
you
clay
there
something
so
big
and
solid
and
dependable
about
you
i
wonder
i
suppose
you
do
mind
my
using
you
as
a
sort
of
anchor
to
windward
good
heavens
audrey
if
i
could
only
do
you
do
have
to
do
a
she
smiled
up
at
him
and
her
old
audacity
was
quite
gone
you
just
got
to
be
and
you
do
have
to
send
me
flowers
you
know
i
mean
i
understand
that
you
sorry
for
me
without
that
you
the
only
person
in
the
world
i
allow
to
be
sorry
for
he
was
touched
there
was
no
coquetry
in
her
manner
she
paid
her
little
tribute
quite
sincerely
and
frankly
i
been
taking
stock
she
went
on
and
i
put
you
among
my
assets
one
reliable
gentleman
six
feet
tall
weight
about
a
hundred
and
seventy
in
good
condition
heavens
what
a
lot
of
liabilities
you
had
to
he
stopped
and
looked
down
at
her
audrey
dear
he
said
what
am
i
to
say
to
all
that
what
can
i
do
how
can
i
help
you
might
tell
me
no
that
what
is
silly
but
she
did
not
answer
she
called
joey
and
gave
him
her
clubs
joey
wants
to
be
a
soldier
she
observed
so
he
i
want
to
be
a
soldier
too
clay
a
good
he
suspected
that
she
was
rather
close
to
unusual
tears
as
they
approached
the
clubhouse
they
saw
graham
and
marion
hayden
standing
outside
graham
was
absently
dropping
balls
and
swinging
at
them
it
was
too
late
when
clayton
saw
the
danger
and
shouted
sharply
a
ball
caught
the
caddie
on
the
side
of
the
head
and
he
dropped
like
a
shot
all
through
that
night
clayton
and
audrey
valentine
sat
by
the
white
bed
in
the
hospital
clayton
knew
graham
was
waiting
outside
but
he
did
not
go
out
to
speak
to
him
he
was
afraid
of
himself
afraid
in
his
anger
that
he
would
widen
the
breach
between
them
early
in
the
evening
natalie
had
come
in
a
great
that
looked
queerly
out
of
place
but
she
had
come
he
knew
not
through
sympathy
for
the
thin
little
figure
on
the
bed
but
as
he
had
known
she
would
come
to
plead
for
graham
and
her
cry
of
joy
when
the
surgeons
had
said
the
boy
would
live
was
again
for
graham
she
had
been
too
engrossed
to
comment
on
audrey
presence
there
and
audrey
had
gone
out
immediately
and
left
them
together
clayton
was
forced
that
night
to
an
unwilling
comparison
of
natalie
with
another
woman
on
the
surface
of
their
lives
where
only
they
met
natalie
had
always
borne
comparison
well
but
here
was
a
new
standard
to
measure
by
and
another
woman
a
woman
with
hands
to
serve
and
watchful
intelligent
eyes
outmeasured
her
not
that
clayton
knew
all
this
he
felt
in
a
vague
way
that
natalie
was
out
of
place
there
and
he
felt
even
more
strongly
that
she
had
not
the
faintest
interest
in
the
still
figure
on
its
white
bed
save
as
it
touched
graham
and
herself
he
was
resentful
too
that
she
felt
it
necessary
to
plead
with
him
for
his
own
boy
good
god
if
she
felt
that
way
about
him
no
wonder
graham
she
had
placed
a
hand
on
clayton
arm
as
he
sat
in
that
endless
vigil
and
bent
down
to
whisper
although
no
sound
would
have
penetrated
that
stupor
it
was
an
accident
clay
she
pled
you
know
graham
the
kindest
soul
in
the
world
you
know
that
he
had
been
his
voice
sounded
cold
and
strained
to
his
own
ears
not
much
almost
nothing
toots
says
then
i
rather
he
had
been
natalie
if
he
drove
that
ball
out
of
wanton
indifference
he
did
see
the
he
should
have
in
her
anger
she
ceased
her
sibilant
whispering
and
stood
erect
i
told
him
you
be
hard
she
said
he
outside
with
fright
because
he
is
afraid
afraid
of
you
she
added
and
went
out
her
silks
rustling
in
the
quiet
corridor
she
had
gone
away
soon
after
that
the
nurse
informed
him
and
toward
dawn
clayton
left
audrey
in
the
sick
room
and
found
graham
he
was
asleep
in
a
chair
in
the
and
looked
boyish
and
very
tired
clayton
heart
contracted
he
went
back
to
his
vigil
and
let
graham
sleep
on
some
time
later
he
roused
from
a
doze
in
his
chair
graham
was
across
the
bed
from
him
looking
down
audrey
was
gone
and
the
injured
boy
stirred
and
opened
his
eyes
joey
said
graham
with
a
catch
in
his
voice
joey
lay
still
his
eyes
taking
in
his
new
surroundings
then
he
put
out
a
hand
and
touched
the
bandage
on
his
head
what
i
got
on
he
demanded
faintly
graham
caught
his
father
eyes
across
the
bed
and
smiled
a
shaky
tremulous
smile
i
guess
he
all
right
father
he
said
and
suddenly
crumpled
up
beside
the
bed
and
fell
into
a
paroxysm
of
silent
sobbing
with
his
arm
around
the
boy
shoulders
clayton
felt
in
that
gray
dawn
the
greatest
thankfulness
of
his
life
joey
would
live
that
cup
was
taken
from
his
boy
lips
and
he
and
graham
were
together
again
close
together
the
boy
grip
on
his
hand
was
tight
please
god
they
would
always
be
together
from
now
on
chapter
ix
clayton
did
not
care
to
tell
natalie
of
chris
flight
she
would
learn
it
soon
enough
he
knew
and
he
felt
unwilling
to
discuss
the
affair
as
natalie
would
want
to
discuss
it
not
that
he
cared
about
chris
but
he
had
begun
to
feel
a
protective
interest
in
audrey
valentine
an
interest
that
had
in
it
a
curious
aversion
to
hearing
her
name
in
connection
with
chris
sordid
story
he
and
natalie
met
rarely
in
the
next
few
days
he
dined
frequently
at
his
club
with
men
connected
in
various
ways
with
the
new
enterprise
and
transacted
an
enormous
amount
of
business
over
the
dinner
or
luncheon
table
natalie
door
was
always
closed
on
those
occasions
when
he
returned
and
he
felt
that
with
the
stubbornness
characteristic
of
her
she
was
still
harboring
resentment
against
him
for
what
he
had
said
at
the
hospital
he
knew
she
was
spending
most
of
her
days
at
linndale
and
he
had
a
vague
idea
that
she
and
rodney
together
had
been
elaborating
still
further
on
the
plans
for
the
house
it
was
the
furtiveness
of
it
rather
than
the
fact
itself
that
troubled
him
he
was
open
and
straightforward
himself
why
could
natalie
be
frank
with
him
it
was
haverford
punctually
paying
her
in
an
age
which
exacts
no
longer
even
from
its
bachelors
who
brought
natalie
the
news
of
chris
going
natalie
who
went
down
to
see
her
with
a
mental
protest
found
her
at
a
window
making
violent
signals
at
somebody
without
and
was
unable
to
conceal
her
amazement
it
delight
explained
haverford
she
driving
me
round
she
wo
come
in
and
she
forgotten
her
fur
coat
and
it
simply
bitter
outside
well
my
dear
how
are
you
natalie
was
well
and
said
so
she
was
conscious
that
haverford
was
listening
with
only
half
an
ear
and
indeed
a
moment
later
she
had
risen
again
and
hurried
to
the
window
natalie
she
cried
do
come
and
watch
she
turning
the
car
we
do
think
she
drives
wonderfully
only
a
few
days
why
wo
she
come
in
i
sure
i
do
know
unless
she
is
afraid
graham
may
be
what
in
the
world
has
graham
got
to
do
with
it
natalie
voice
was
faintly
scornful
i
was
going
to
ask
you
that
natalie
have
they
quarreled
or
anything
i
do
think
they
meet
at
all
do
they
they
met
once
since
clayton
gave
doctor
haverford
the
car
graham
helped
her
when
she
had
got
into
a
ditch
i
believe
and
i
thought
perhaps
they
had
quarreled
about
that
would
imply
a
degree
of
intimacy
that
hardly
exists
does
it
natalie
said
sharply
but
haverford
had
not
fought
the
verbal
battles
of
the
parish
for
twenty
years
in
vain
it
was
the
day
of
that
unfortunate
incident
at
the
country
club
natalie
colored
accident
rather
than
how
is
the
poor
child
he
is
quite
well
again
natalie
said
impatiently
i
can
not
understand
the
amount
of
fuss
every
one
makes
over
the
boy
he
ran
in
front
of
where
graham
was
driving
and
got
what
he
probably
i
understand
clayton
has
given
him
a
he
has
made
him
an
office
how
like
dear
clayton
breathed
haverford
and
counted
the
honors
as
hers
but
she
had
not
come
to
quarrel
she
had
had
indeed
a
frankly
benevolent
purpose
in
coming
and
she
proceeded
to
carry
it
out
at
once
i
do
think
my
dear
she
said
that
some
one
ought
to
tell
audrey
valentine
the
stories
that
are
going
what
has
she
been
doing
natalie
asked
with
her
cool
smile
there
is
always
some
story
about
audrey
is
there
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
heard
i
do
hear
much
haverford
let
that
pass
you
know
how
rabid
she
has
been
about
the
war
well
the
story
is
she
went
on
with
a
certain
unction
that
she
has
driven
chris
to
enlisting
in
the
foreign
legion
or
something
anyhow
he
sailed
from
halifax
last
natalie
straightened
in
her
chair
are
you
certain
it
town
talk
my
dear
doctor
haverford
spoke
to
clayton
about
it
some
days
ago
he
rather
gathered
clayton
already
that
too
was
like
dear
clayton
natalie
reflected
bitterly
he
had
told
her
nothing
in
her
heart
she
added
secretiveness
to
the
long
list
of
clayton
deficiencies
toward
her
personally
i
imagine
they
were
heavily
in
debt
haverford
went
on
they
had
been
living
beyond
their
means
of
course
i
like
valentine
but
i
do
think
to
drive
a
man
to
his
death
or
what
may
be
his
death
i
do
believe
it
i
do
believe
he
went
to
fight
anyway
he
was
probably
in
some
sort
of
a
she
has
sold
her
natalie
impulse
of
sympathy
toward
audrey
was
drowned
in
her
rising
indignation
that
all
this
could
happen
and
audrey
not
let
her
know
was
incredible
i
have
seen
her
recently
she
said
coldly
nobody
has
i
do
think
she
might
have
seen
her
clergyman
there
is
a
time
when
only
the
church
can
give
us
the
comfort
we
need
my
and
whatever
haverford
faults
she
meant
that
quite
simply
and
you
say
clay
knew
it
rather
likely
he
would
they
were
golfing
together
were
they
when
that
caddie
was
hurt
natalie
was
not
a
jealous
woman
she
had
for
years
taken
faithfulness
for
granted
and
her
own
complacency
admitted
no
chance
of
such
a
possibility
but
she
was
quick
to
realize
that
she
had
him
at
a
disadvantage
how
long
have
you
known
it
she
asked
him
that
night
when
after
the
long
dinner
was
over
she
sat
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
faced
him
across
the
candles
he
was
tired
and
depressed
and
his
fine
face
looked
drawn
but
he
roused
and
smiled
across
at
her
he
had
begun
to
have
a
feeling
that
he
must
make
up
to
natalie
for
something
he
hardly
knew
for
what
known
what
dear
about
chris
and
audrey
he
was
fundamentally
honest
so
he
answered
her
directly
since
the
day
chris
when
was
that
the
day
we
dined
and
audrey
told
you
she
had
to
in
a
way
i
sure
she
tell
you
herself
she
been
rather
hiding
away
i
why
did
she
have
to
tell
you
if
you
want
the
exact
truth
she
borrowed
a
small
sum
from
me
as
the
banks
were
closed
naturally
there
was
some
emergency
i
do
know
she
borrowed
from
you
a
very
small
amount
my
dear
do
look
like
that
natalie
she
knew
i
generally
carried
money
with
oh
i
not
jealous
audrey
probably
thinks
of
you
as
a
sort
of
grandfather
anyhow
it
not
that
it
is
your
keeping
the
thing
from
it
was
not
my
but
natalie
was
jealous
she
had
that
curious
jealousy
of
her
friends
which
some
women
are
cursed
with
of
being
first
in
their
regard
and
their
confidence
a
slow
and
smoldering
anger
against
audrey
which
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
clayton
darkened
her
eyes
i
through
with
audrey
that
all
she
said
and
the
man
across
regarded
her
with
a
sort
of
puzzled
wonder
her
indignation
against
clayton
took
the
form
of
calculation
and
she
was
quick
to
pursue
her
advantage
in
the
library
she
produced
the
new
and
enlarged
plans
for
the
house
roddie
says
he
has
tried
to
call
you
at
the
mill
but
you
are
always
out
of
your
office
so
he
sent
these
around
true
to
the
resolution
he
had
made
that
night
in
the
hospital
he
went
over
them
carefully
and
even
their
magnitude
while
it
alarmed
him
brought
no
protest
from
him
after
all
the
mill
and
the
new
plant
were
his
toys
to
play
with
he
found
there
something
to
fill
up
the
emptiness
of
his
life
if
a
great
house
was
natalie
ambition
if
it
gave
her
pleasure
and
something
to
live
for
she
ought
to
have
it
she
had
prepared
herself
for
a
protest
but
he
made
none
even
when
the
rather
startling
estimate
was
placed
before
him
i
just
want
you
to
be
happy
my
dear
he
said
but
i
hope
arrange
not
to
run
over
the
estimate
it
is
being
pretty
expensive
as
it
is
but
after
all
success
does
mean
anything
unless
we
are
going
to
get
something
out
of
they
were
closer
together
that
evening
than
they
had
been
for
months
and
at
last
he
fell
to
talking
about
the
mill
natalie
curled
up
on
the
chaise
longue
in
her
boudoir
listened
attentively
but
with
small
comprehension
as
he
poured
out
his
dream
for
himself
now
for
graham
later
a
few
years
more
and
he
would
retire
graham
could
take
hold
then
he
might
even
go
into
politics
he
would
be
fifty
then
and
a
man
of
fifty
should
be
in
his
prime
and
to
retire
and
do
nothing
was
impossible
a
fellow
went
to
seed
eyes
on
the
wood
fire
he
talked
on
until
at
last
roused
by
silence
he
glanced
up
she
was
sound
asleep
some
time
later
in
his
and
slippers
he
came
and
roused
her
she
smiled
up
at
him
like
a
drowsy
child
awfully
tired
she
said
is
graham
in
not
she
held
up
her
hands
and
he
drew
her
to
her
feet
you
been
awfully
dear
about
the
house
she
said
and
standing
on
tiptoe
she
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
still
holding
both
her
hands
he
looked
down
at
her
gravely
do
you
really
think
that
natalie
of
then
will
you
do
something
in
return
her
eyes
became
shrewd
watchful
anything
in
do
do
dear
make
graham
afraid
of
as
if
i
did
if
he
is
afraid
of
you
it
is
your
own
fault
perhaps
it
is
but
i
try
good
god
natalie
i
do
try
he
needs
a
curb
now
and
then
all
boys
do
but
if
we
could
only
agree
on
it
do
you
see
how
it
is
now
he
asked
trying
to
reason
gently
with
her
all
the
discipline
comes
from
me
all
the
indulgence
from
you
and
i
do
want
to
lose
my
boy
my
she
freed
her
hands
so
we
could
even
have
one
happy
evening
she
said
i
wo
quarrel
with
you
clay
and
i
wo
be
tragic
over
graham
if
you
just
be
human
to
him
he
come
out
all
she
went
into
her
bedroom
the
heavy
lace
of
her
negligee
trailing
behind
her
and
closed
the
door
clayton
had
a
visitor
the
next
morning
at
the
mill
a
man
named
dunbar
who
marked
on
his
visitors
slip
under
the
heading
of
his
business
with
the
head
of
the
concern
the
words
private
and
clayton
looking
up
saw
a
small
man
in
a
suit
too
large
for
him
and
with
ears
that
projected
wide
on
either
side
of
a
shrewd
rather
humorous
face
mr
spencer
yes
sit
down
even
through
the
closed
window
the
noise
of
the
mill
penetrated
the
whistled
shrilly
the
clatter
of
the
far
away
roar
of
the
furnaces
the
immediate
vicinity
of
many
typewriters
made
a
very
bedlam
of
sound
dunbar
drew
his
chair
closer
and
laid
a
card
on
the
desk
my
credentials
he
explained
clayton
read
the
card
very
well
dunbar
what
can
i
do
for
you
dunbar
fixed
him
with
shrewd
light
eyes
and
bent
forward
have
you
had
any
trouble
in
your
mill
spencer
none
are
you
taking
any
measures
to
prevent
trouble
i
had
expected
to
not
that
i
fear
anything
but
of
course
no
one
can
tell
we
have
barely
commenced
to
get
lined
up
for
our
new
may
i
ask
the
nature
of
the
precautions
clayton
told
him
with
an
uneasy
feeling
that
dunbar
was
finding
them
childish
and
inefficient
exactly
said
his
visitor
and
well
enough
as
far
as
they
go
they
do
go
far
enough
the
trouble
with
you
manufacturers
is
that
you
only
recognize
one
sort
of
trouble
and
that
a
strike
i
suppose
you
know
that
the
kaiser
has
said
if
we
enter
the
war
that
he
need
not
send
an
army
here
at
all
that
his
army
is
here
already
armed
and
bravado
said
clayton
i
wonder
dunbar
reached
into
his
breast
pocket
and
produced
a
long
typed
memorandum
you
might
just
glance
at
clayton
read
it
carefully
it
was
a
list
of
fires
mostly
in
granaries
and
warehouses
and
the
total
loss
was
appalling
all
german
work
said
his
visitor
arson
for
the
fatherland
all
supplies
for
the
allies
you
see
i
got
other
similar
lists
here
all
german
deviltry
and
they
only
commencing
if
we
go
into
the
war
the
immediate
result
of
the
visit
was
that
clayton
became
a
member
of
a
protective
league
which
undertook
with
his
cooperation
to
police
and
guard
the
mill
but
dunbar
last
words
left
him
thinking
profoundly
we
going
to
be
in
it
that
sure
and
soon
and
germany
army
is
here
it
not
only
germans
either
it
the
for
one
thing
we
got
a
list
through
the
british
censor
of
a
lot
of
those
fellows
who
are
taking
german
money
they
against
everything
not
only
work
they
against
law
and
order
and
likely
to
raise
he
rose
to
leave
how
do
your
germans
like
making
shells
for
the
allies
he
asked
we
have
a
great
many
we
had
no
trouble
one
man
resigned
a
boss
roller
that
watch
him
he
got
a
he
been
here
a
long
time
i
have
an
idea
he
do
us
any
harm
it
was
a
matter
of
principle
with
oh
it
a
matter
of
principle
with
all
of
them
they
can
justify
themselves
seven
ways
to
the
ace
keep
an
eye
on
him
or
let
us
do
it
for
clayton
sat
for
some
time
after
dunbar
had
gone
was
it
possible
that
klein
or
men
like
klein
old
employees
and
faithful
for
years
could
be
reached
by
the
insidious
wickedness
of
germany
it
was
incredible
but
then
the
whole
situation
was
incredible
that
a
peaceful
and
people
to
all
appearances
should
suddenly
shed
the
sheep
skin
of
years
of
dissimulation
and
appear
as
the
wolves
of
the
world
one
of
his
men
had
died
on
the
lusitania
a
quiet
little
chap
with
a
family
in
the
suburbs
and
a
mania
for
raising
dahlias
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
bringing
in
his
best
specimens
and
putting
them
in
water
on
clayton
desk
his
pressed
glass
vase
was
still
there
empty
then
his
mind
went
back
to
herman
klein
he
had
a
daughter
in
the
mill
she
was
earning
the
livelihood
for
the
family
now
temporarily
and
the
germans
were
thrifty
if
for
no
other
reason
he
thought
klein
would
not
imperil
either
his
daughter
safety
or
her
salary
there
was
a
good
bit
of
talk
about
german
hate
but
surely
there
was
no
hate
in
klein
something
else
dunbar
had
said
stuck
in
his
mind
we
got
to
get
wise
and
soon
it
too
big
a
job
for
the
regular
departments
to
handle
every
city
in
the
country
and
every
town
ought
to
have
a
civilian
organization
to
watch
and
to
fight
it
if
it
has
to
they
hiding
among
us
everywhere
and
every
citizen
has
got
to
be
a
sleuth
if
we
to
counter
their
moves
every
man
his
own
detective
he
had
smiled
as
he
said
it
but
clayton
had
surmised
a
great
earnestness
and
considerable
knowledge
behind
the
smile
chapter
x
delight
haverford
was
to
come
out
in
december
but
there
were
times
when
the
doctor
wondered
if
she
was
really
as
keen
about
it
as
she
pretended
to
be
he
found
her
once
or
twice
her
usually
active
hands
idle
in
her
lap
and
a
pensive
droop
to
her
humorous
young
mouth
tired
honey
he
asked
on
one
of
those
occasions
no
just
talking
to
say
a
few
nice
things
for
me
while
you
about
it
nice
things
i
do
deserve
what
awful
crime
have
you
been
committing
break
it
to
me
gently
you
know
my
weak
your
tobacco
heart
she
said
severely
well
i
been
committing
a
mental
murder
if
you
want
to
know
the
facts
do
protest
it
done
she
quite
dead
good
gracious
and
i
have
reared
this
young
viper
who
is
she
i
do
intend
to
make
you
an
accessory
but
behind
her
smile
he
felt
a
real
hurt
he
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
have
taken
her
in
his
arms
and
tried
to
coax
out
her
trouble
so
he
might
comfort
her
but
that
essential
fineness
in
him
which
his
worldliness
only
covered
like
a
veneer
told
him
not
to
force
her
confidence
only
he
wandered
off
rather
disconsolately
to
hunt
his
pipe
and
to
try
to
realize
that
delight
was
now
a
woman
grown
and
liable
to
woman
what
do
you
think
it
is
he
asked
that
night
when
after
her
nightly
custom
haverford
had
reached
over
from
the
bed
beside
his
and
with
a
single
competent
gesture
had
taken
away
his
book
and
switched
off
his
reading
lamp
and
he
had
with
the
courage
of
darkness
voiced
a
certain
uneasiness
who
do
you
think
it
is
you
very
well
only
the
word
is
haverford
ignored
this
it
that
hayden
girl
she
said
toots
and
graham
do
you
think
that
delight
she
always
has
for
which
was
apparently
quite
clear
to
them
both
if
it
had
only
been
a
nice
girl
haverford
protested
plaintively
but
toots
she
fast
i
sure
of
my
dear
and
that
boy
needs
a
decent
girl
if
anybody
ever
did
a
shallow
mother
and
a
father
all
toots
hay
den
wants
is
his
money
she
ages
older
than
he
is
i
hear
he
is
there
every
day
and
all
of
the
rector
had
precisely
as
much
guile
as
a
turtle
dove
and
long
after
haverford
gave
unmistakable
evidences
of
slumber
he
lay
with
his
arms
above
his
head
and
plotted
he
had
no
conscience
whatever
about
it
he
threw
his
scruples
to
the
wind
and
if
it
is
possible
to
follow
the
twists
of
a
theological
mind
turned
from
the
straight
and
narrow
way
into
the
maze
of
conspiracy
his
thoughts
ran
something
like
this
she
is
delight
therefore
to
see
her
is
to
love
her
to
see
her
with
any
other
girl
is
to
see
her
infinite
superiority
and
charm
therefore
therefore
on
the
following
sunday
afternoon
the
totally
unsuspecting
daughter
of
a
good
man
gone
wrong
took
a
note
from
the
rector
to
the
hayden
house
about
something
or
other
of
no
importance
and
was
instructed
to
wait
for
an
answer
and
the
rector
vastly
uneasy
and
rather
pleased
with
himself
took
refuge
in
the
parish
house
and
waited
ten
eternities
or
one
hour
by
the
clock
delight
herself
was
totally
unsuspicious
the
rectory
on
a
sunday
afternoon
was
very
quiet
and
she
was
glad
to
get
away
she
drove
over
and
being
in
no
hurry
she
went
by
the
spencer
house
she
did
that
now
and
then
making
various
excuses
to
herself
such
as
liking
the
policeman
at
the
corner
or
wanting
to
see
the
river
from
the
end
of
the
street
but
all
she
saw
that
day
was
rodney
page
going
in
in
a
top
hat
and
very
bright
gloves
precious
said
delight
to
herself
her
bump
of
reverence
was
very
small
but
she
felt
a
little
thrill
as
she
always
did
when
she
passed
the
house
since
she
could
remember
she
had
cared
for
graham
she
did
not
actually
know
that
she
loved
him
she
told
herself
bravely
that
she
was
awfully
fond
of
him
and
that
it
was
silly
because
he
never
would
amount
to
anything
but
she
had
a
little
argument
of
her
own
for
such
occasions
which
said
that
being
really
fond
of
any
one
meant
knowing
all
about
them
and
liking
them
anyhow
she
stopped
the
car
at
the
hayden
house
and
carried
her
note
to
the
door
when
she
went
in
however
she
was
instantly
uncomfortable
the
place
reeked
with
smoke
and
undeniably
there
was
dancing
going
on
somewhere
a
phonograph
was
scraping
noisily
delight
small
nose
lifted
a
little
what
a
deadly
place
coming
in
from
the
fresh
outdoors
the
noise
and
smoke
and
reek
stifled
her
then
a
door
opened
and
marion
hayden
was
drawing
her
into
a
room
how
providential
delight
she
said
you
take
my
hand
wo
you
it
graham
dummy
and
we
want
to
the
two
connecting
rooms
were
full
of
people
and
the
air
was
heavy
through
the
haze
she
saw
graham
and
nodded
to
him
but
with
a
little
sinking
of
the
heart
she
was
aware
however
that
he
was
looking
at
her
with
a
curious
intentness
and
a
certain
expectancy
maybe
he
only
hoped
she
would
let
him
dance
with
toots
no
thanks
she
said
why
not
delight
just
a
hand
three
good
reasons
i
do
play
cards
on
sunday
i
do
ever
play
for
money
and
i
stifling
for
breath
already
in
this
she
was
indeed
a
little
breathless
there
was
had
she
only
seen
it
relief
in
graham
face
she
did
not
belong
there
he
felt
delight
was
well
she
was
different
he
had
not
been
thinking
of
her
before
she
came
in
he
forgot
her
promptly
the
moment
she
went
out
but
she
had
given
him
for
an
instant
a
breath
of
the
fresh
and
quietness
and
perhaps
something
clean
and
fine
there
was
an
insistent
clamor
that
she
stay
and
tommy
hale
even
got
down
on
his
knees
and
made
a
quite
impassioned
appeal
but
chin
was
very
high
although
she
smiled
you
are
all
very
nice
she
said
but
i
sure
i
bore
you
in
a
minute
and
i
certain
you
bore
me
besides
i
think
you
quite
likely
to
be
which
met
with
great
applause
but
there
was
nothing
of
delight
of
the
high
head
when
she
got
out
of
her
car
and
crept
up
the
rectory
steps
how
could
she
even
have
cared
how
could
she
that
was
his
life
those
were
the
people
he
chose
to
play
with
she
had
a
sense
of
loss
rather
than
injury
the
rector
tapping
at
her
door
a
little
later
received
the
answer
to
his
note
through
a
very
narrow
crack
and
went
away
feeling
that
the
way
of
the
wicked
is
indeed
hard
clayton
had
been
watching
with
growing
concern
graham
intimacy
with
the
gay
crowd
that
revolved
around
marion
hayden
it
was
more
thoughtless
than
vicious
more
than
wicked
but
its
influence
was
bad
and
he
knew
it
but
he
was
very
busy
at
night
he
was
too
tired
to
confront
the
inevitable
wrangle
with
natalie
that
any
protest
about
graham
always
evoked
and
he
was
anxious
not
to
disturb
the
new
rapprochement
with
the
boy
by
direct
criticism
the
middle
of
december
which
found
the
construction
work
at
the
new
plant
well
advanced
saw
the
social
season
definitely
on
also
and
he
found
himself
night
after
night
going
to
dinners
and
then
on
to
balls
there
were
fewer
private
dances
than
in
previous
winters
but
society
had
taken
up
various
war
activities
and
made
them
fashionable
the
result
was
great
charity
balls
on
these
occasions
he
found
himself
watching
for
audrey
always
she
had
with
a
sort
of
diabolical
cleverness
succeeded
in
losing
herself
her
house
was
sold
he
knew
and
he
had
expected
that
she
would
let
him
know
where
to
find
her
she
had
said
she
counted
on
him
and
he
had
derived
an
odd
sort
of
comfort
from
the
thought
it
had
warmed
him
to
think
that
out
of
all
the
people
he
knew
to
one
woman
he
meant
something
more
than
success
but
although
he
searched
the
gayest
crowds
with
his
eyes
those
hilarious
groups
of
which
she
had
been
so
frequently
the
center
he
did
not
find
her
and
there
had
been
no
letter
save
a
brief
one
without
an
address
enclosing
her
check
for
the
money
she
had
borrowed
she
had
apparently
gone
not
only
out
of
her
old
life
but
out
of
his
as
well
at
one
of
the
great
charity
balls
he
met
nolan
and
they
stood
together
watching
the
crowd
pretty
expensive
i
take
it
nolan
said
indicating
the
scene
orchestra
florist
supper
i
wonder
how
much
the
belgians
will
personally
i
rather
send
the
money
and
get
some
precisely
but
would
you
send
the
money
we
got
to
have
a
quid
pro
quo
you
of
he
surveyed
the
crowd
with
cynical
dissatisfied
eyes
at
the
end
of
two
years
of
the
war
he
observed
apropos
of
nothing
five
million
men
are
dead
and
eleven
million
have
been
wounded
a
lot
of
them
were
doing
this
sort
of
thing
two
years
i
would
like
to
know
where
we
will
be
two
years
from
some
of
us
wo
be
here
have
you
seen
lloyd
george
speech
on
the
german
peace
terms
that
means
going
on
to
the
end
a
speedy
peace
might
have
left
us
out
but
there
will
be
no
peace
not
yet
or
and
still
we
do
prepare
the
english
tradition
persists
said
the
irishman
bitterly
we
want
to
wait
and
play
to
the
last
moment
and
then
upset
our
business
and
overthrow
the
whole
country
trying
to
get
ready
in
a
hurry
i
wonder
what
they
will
do
when
the
time
comes
with
men
like
you
and
myself
take
our
money
said
nolan
viciously
tax
our
heads
off
thank
god
i
have
a
clayton
eyed
him
with
the
comprehension
of
long
acquaintance
exactly
he
said
but
you
go
yourself
if
you
and
fight
for
england
i
will
he
pursued
the
subject
further
going
into
an
excited
account
of
ireland
grievances
he
was
flushed
and
loquacious
he
quoted
lloyd
george
quagmire
of
distrust
in
tones
raised
over
the
noise
of
the
band
and
clayton
was
conscious
of
a
growing
uneasiness
how
much
of
it
was
real
how
much
a
pose
was
nolan
representative
of
the
cultured
irishman
in
america
and
if
he
was
what
would
be
the
effect
of
their
mania
would
we
find
ourselves
like
the
british
split
into
factions
or
would
the
country
be
drawn
together
by
trouble
until
it
changed
from
a
federation
of
states
to
a
great
nation
united
and
unbeatable
were
we
really
the
melting
pot
of
the
world
and
was
war
the
fiery
furnace
which
was
to
fuse
us
together
or
were
there
elements
like
nolan
like
the
that
would
never
fuse
he
left
nolan
still
irritable
and
explosive
and
danced
once
with
natalie
his
only
dance
of
the
evening
then
finding
that
rodney
page
would
see
her
to
her
car
later
he
went
home
he
had
a
vague
sense
of
disappointment
a
return
of
the
critical
mood
of
the
early
days
of
his
return
from
france
he
went
to
his
room
and
tried
to
read
but
he
gave
it
up
and
lay
cigaret
in
hand
thinking
there
ought
to
have
come
to
a
man
when
he
reached
the
middle
span
certain
compensations
for
the
things
that
had
gone
with
his
youth
the
call
of
adventure
the
violent
impulses
of
his
early
love
life
there
should
come
to
take
their
place
friends
a
new
zest
in
the
romance
of
achievement
since
other
romance
had
gone
and
peace
but
the
peace
of
the
middle
span
of
life
should
be
the
peace
of
fulfillment
and
of
a
home
and
a
woman
natalie
was
not
happy
but
she
seemed
contented
enough
her
life
satisfied
her
the
new
house
in
the
bridge
the
theater
in
the
evening
or
the
opera
dinners
dances
clothes
they
seemed
to
be
enough
for
her
but
his
life
was
not
enough
for
him
what
did
he
want
anyhow
in
god
name
what
did
he
want
one
night
impatient
with
himself
he
picked
up
the
book
of
love
lyrics
in
its
mauve
cover
from
his
bedside
table
he
read
one
then
another
he
read
them
slowly
engrossingly
it
was
as
though
something
starved
in
him
was
feeding
eagerly
on
this
poor
food
their
passion
stirred
him
as
in
his
earlier
years
he
had
never
been
stirred
for
just
a
little
time
while
natalie
danced
that
night
clayton
spencer
faced
the
tragedy
of
the
man
in
his
prime
still
strong
and
lusty
with
life
with
the
deeper
passions
of
the
deepening
years
who
has
outgrown
and
outloved
the
woman
he
married
a
man
house
must
be
built
on
love
without
love
it
can
not
stand
natalie
coming
in
much
later
and
seeing
his
light
still
on
found
him
sleeping
with
one
arm
under
his
head
and
a
small
black
hole
burned
in
the
monogrammed
linen
sheet
the
book
of
poems
had
slipped
to
the
floor
the
next
day
she
missed
it
from
its
place
and
clayton
man
interrogated
said
he
had
asked
to
have
it
put
away
somewhere
he
did
not
care
for
it
natalie
raised
her
eyebrows
she
had
thought
the
poems
rather
pretty
one
resolution
clayton
made
as
a
result
of
that
night
he
would
not
see
audrey
again
if
he
could
help
it
he
was
not
in
love
with
her
and
he
did
not
intend
to
be
he
was
determinedly
honest
with
himself
men
in
his
discontented
state
were
only
too
apt
to
build
up
a
compounded
of
their
own
starved
fancy
and
translate
her
into
terms
of
the
first
attractive
woman
who
happened
to
cross
the
path
he
was
not
going
to
be
a
driveling
idiot
like
chris
and
some
of
the
other
men
he
knew
things
were
bad
but
they
could
be
much
worse
it
happened
then
that
when
audrey
called
him
at
the
mill
a
day
or
so
later
it
was
a
very
formal
voice
that
came
back
to
her
over
the
wire
she
was
quick
to
catch
his
tone
i
suppose
you
hate
being
called
in
business
hours
clay
not
at
that
means
yes
you
know
but
i
going
even
further
i
coming
down
to
see
why
is
anything
wrong
he
could
hear
her
laughter
a
warm
little
chuckle
do
be
so
urgent
she
said
gayly
i
want
to
consult
you
all
may
i
come
there
was
a
second
pause
then
do
you
think
i
better
come
to
see
you
i
only
a
little
flat
i
do
think
you
like
that
nonsense
where
is
it
she
gave
him
the
address
when
shall
i
come
whenever
it
suits
you
i
have
nothing
to
do
say
this
afternoon
about
that
nothing
to
do
was
an
odd
change
in
itself
for
audrey
had
been
in
the
habit
of
doling
out
her
time
like
sweetmeats
where
in
the
world
have
you
been
all
this
time
he
demanded
almost
angrily
to
his
own
surprise
he
was
suddenly
conscious
of
a
sense
of
indignation
and
affront
she
had
said
she
depended
on
him
and
then
she
had
gone
away
and
hidden
herself
it
was
ridiculous
just
getting
acquainted
with
myself
she
replied
with
something
of
her
old
airy
manner
his
irritation
passed
as
quickly
as
it
came
he
felt
calm
and
very
sure
of
himself
and
rather
joey
who
was
by
now
installed
as
an
office
adjunct
and
who
commonly
referred
to
the
mill
as
ours
heard
him
whistling
blithely
and
cocked
an
ear
in
the
direction
of
the
inner
room
guess
we
made
another
million
dollars
he
observed
to
the
clayton
was
not
in
the
habit
of
paying
afternoon
calls
on
women
the
number
of
such
calls
that
he
had
paid
without
natalie
during
his
married
life
could
have
been
numbered
on
the
fingers
of
his
two
hands
most
of
the
men
he
knew
paid
such
visits
dropping
in
somewhere
for
tea
or
a
highball
on
the
way
uptown
he
had
preferred
his
club
when
he
had
a
little
time
the
society
of
other
men
he
wondered
if
he
should
call
natalie
and
tell
her
but
he
decided
against
it
it
was
possible
for
one
thing
that
audrey
still
did
not
wish
her
presence
in
town
known
if
she
did
she
would
tell
natalie
herself
and
it
was
possible
too
that
she
wanted
to
discuss
chris
and
the
reason
for
his
going
he
felt
a
real
sense
of
relief
when
at
last
he
saw
her
to
find
her
looking
much
the
same
as
ever
he
hardly
knew
what
he
had
expected
audrey
having
warned
him
as
to
the
apartment
did
not
mention
its
poverty
again
it
was
a
tiny
little
place
but
it
had
an
open
fire
in
the
and
plain
walls
and
she
had
given
it
that
curious
air
of
distinction
with
which
she
managed
in
her
casual
way
to
invest
everything
about
her
i
hope
you
observe
how
neat
i
am
she
said
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
my
rooms
of
frightfully
he
towered
in
the
low
room
audrey
sat
down
and
surveyed
him
as
he
stood
by
the
fire
it
is
nice
to
have
a
man
about
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
been
living
here
without
even
visitors
for
two
months
you
laugh
clay
i
studying
studying
what
stenography
oh
it
not
as
bad
as
that
i
do
have
to
earn
my
living
i
just
got
to
do
something
for
my
soul
sake
i
went
all
over
the
ground
and
i
saw
i
was
just
a
cumberer
of
the
earth
and
then
i
thought
she
hesitated
what
did
you
think
if
some
time
or
other
i
could
release
a
man
to
go
and
fight
it
would
be
the
next
best
thing
to
giving
myself
not
here
necessarily
i
believe
we
will
ever
go
in
but
in
england
you
released
he
released
himself
and
he
not
fighting
he
driving
an
he
waited
hoping
she
would
go
on
he
was
not
curious
but
he
thought
it
might
be
good
for
her
to
talk
chris
and
the
trouble
over
with
some
one
but
she
sat
silent
and
suddenly
asked
him
if
he
cared
for
tea
he
refused
how
natalie
very
and
the
house
held
up
by
cold
weather
now
it
should
be
finished
by
the
end
of
clay
she
said
after
a
moment
are
you
going
to
employ
women
in
the
new
munition
works
in
certain
departments
i
have
a
girl
i
want
work
for
she
not
trained
of
none
of
them
are
we
have
to
teach
them
i
can
give
you
a
card
to
the
employment
department
if
you
want
there
was
a
short
silence
she
sat
looking
at
the
fire
and
he
had
a
chance
to
notice
the
change
in
her
she
had
visualized
it
herself
her
long
were
gone
and
with
them
some
of
the
insolence
they
had
seemed
to
accentuate
she
was
not
rouged
and
he
had
thought
at
first
for
that
reason
that
she
looked
she
was
even
differently
dressed
in
something
dark
and
girlish
with
a
boyish
white
eton
collar
i
wonder
if
you
think
i
hiding
clay
she
said
finally
well
what
are
you
doing
he
smiled
down
at
her
from
the
paying
my
bills
that
not
all
the
truth
either
i
tell
you
clay
i
just
got
sick
of
it
all
when
chris
left
i
had
a
chance
to
burn
my
bridges
and
i
burned
them
the
same
people
the
same
talk
the
same
food
the
same
days
filled
with
the
same
silly
things
that
took
all
my
time
and
gave
me
how
long
had
you
been
feeling
like
that
i
do
know
ever
since
the
war
i
suppose
i
just
got
to
thinking
her
voice
trailed
off
i
have
some
of
chris
scotch
if
you
want
a
thanks
no
audrey
do
you
hear
from
chris
yes
he
in
a
dangerous
place
now
and
sometimes
at
night
i
suppose
i
did
force
him
in
a
way
he
was
doing
no
good
here
and
i
thought
he
would
find
himself
over
there
but
i
did
send
him
he
me
about
making
he
was
a
little
bit
disappointed
evidently
she
did
not
depend
on
him
enough
to
tell
him
chris
story
but
again
she
was
being
loyal
to
chris
he
told
her
about
the
mill
phrasing
his
explanation
in
the
simplest
language
the
presses
drilling
on
metal
the
great
anvils
the
forge
the
with
its
lathes
where
the
rough
surfaces
of
the
shells
were
first
and
then
machined
to
the
most
exact
measurements
and
finding
her
interested
he
told
her
of
women
workers
in
their
overalls
and
caps
and
of
the
silence
and
lack
of
movement
in
the
where
one
entered
with
feet
and
the
women
silent
and
intent
sat
all
day
and
all
night
with
queer
veils
over
their
faces
filling
shells
with
the
death
load
audrey
listened
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
head
if
other
women
can
do
that
sort
of
thing
why
ca
i
clay
but
why
i
it
not
work
for
a
lady
how
you
are
there
are
no
ladies
any
more
just
women
and
if
we
are
measured
by
our
usefulness
instead
of
our
general
well
we
ought
to
be
oh
i
had
time
to
think
he
was
hardly
listening
seeing
her
after
all
those
weeks
had
brought
him
a
wonderful
feeling
of
peace
the
little
room
with
its
fire
was
cozy
and
inviting
but
he
was
quite
sure
looking
down
at
her
that
he
was
not
in
danger
of
falling
in
love
with
her
there
was
no
riot
in
him
no
faint
stirring
of
the
emotions
of
that
hour
with
the
mauve
book
there
was
no
suspicion
in
him
that
the
ways
of
love
change
with
the
years
that
the
passions
of
the
forties
when
they
come
are
to
those
of
the
early
years
as
the
deep
sea
to
a
shallow
lake
less
easily
roused
infinitely
more
terrible
this
girl
you
spoke
about
that
was
the
business
you
mentioned
she
hesitated
i
could
have
asked
you
that
over
the
telephone
could
i
the
plain
truth
is
that
i
had
two
bad
months
never
mind
why
and
christmas
was
coming
and
i
just
wanted
to
see
your
perfectly
sane
and
normal
face
i
wish
you
let
me
know
sooner
where
you
she
evaded
his
eyes
i
was
getting
settled
and
studying
and
learning
to
knit
and
oh
the
most
wretched
knitter
clay
i
just
stick
at
it
doggedly
i
say
to
myself
that
hands
that
can
play
golf
and
use
a
pen
and
shoot
and
drive
a
car
have
got
to
learn
to
knit
but
look
here
she
held
up
a
forlorn
looking
sock
to
his
amused
gaze
and
i
think
a
clever
you
a
very
brave
woman
audrey
he
said
you
let
me
come
back
wo
you
heavens
yes
whenever
you
like
and
i
going
to
stop
being
a
recluse
i
just
wanted
to
think
over
some
on
the
way
home
he
stopped
at
his
florist
and
ordered
a
mass
of
american
beauties
for
her
on
christmas
morning
she
had
sent
her
love
to
natalie
so
that
night
he
told
natalie
he
had
seen
her
and
such
details
of
her
life
as
he
knew
i
glad
she
coming
to
her
senses
natalie
said
everything
been
deadly
dull
without
her
she
always
made
things
go
i
do
know
just
how
she
added
as
if
she
had
been
turning
her
over
in
her
mind
what
sort
of
business
did
she
want
to
see
you
about
she
has
a
girl
she
wants
to
get
into
the
good
gracious
she
must
be
changed
said
natalie
and
proceeded
she
was
ready
to
go
out
to
dinner
to
one
of
her
long
and
critical
surveys
of
herself
in
the
cheval
mirror
recently
those
surveys
had
been
rather
getting
on
clayton
nerves
she
customarily
talked
not
to
him
but
to
his
reflection
over
her
shoulder
when
indeed
she
took
her
eyes
from
herself
i
wonder
she
said
fussing
with
a
who
audrey
will
marry
if
anything
happens
to
chris
she
saw
his
face
and
raised
her
eyebrows
you
need
scowl
like
that
he
quite
as
likely
as
not
never
to
come
back
is
he
and
audrey
did
care
a
pin
for
we
talking
rather
lightly
of
a
very
terrible
thing
are
we
oh
you
not
she
retorted
you
think
just
the
same
things
as
i
do
but
you
not
so
open
about
them
that
chapter
xi
graham
was
engaged
he
hardly
knew
himself
how
it
had
come
about
his
affair
with
marion
had
been
up
to
the
very
moment
of
his
blurted
out
i
want
you
as
as
that
of
any
of
the
assorted
young
couples
who
flirted
and
kissed
behind
the
closed
doors
of
that
popular
house
the
crowd
which
frequented
the
hayden
home
was
gay
tolerant
and
occasionally
nasty
it
made
ardent
love
it
drank
rather
more
than
it
should
and
its
desire
for
a
good
time
often
brought
it
rather
close
to
the
danger
line
it
did
not
actually
step
over
but
it
hovered
gayly
on
the
brink
and
toots
remained
of
her
little
cult
the
men
liked
her
the
girls
imitated
her
and
graham
young
as
he
was
seeing
her
popularity
was
vastly
gratified
to
find
himself
standing
high
in
her
favor
marion
was
playing
for
the
stake
of
the
spencer
money
in
her
intimate
circle
every
one
knew
it
but
graham
how
every
little
millionaire
was
tommy
hale
usual
greeting
she
knew
only
one
way
to
handle
men
and
with
the
stake
of
the
spencer
money
she
tried
every
lure
of
her
experience
on
graham
it
was
always
marion
who
on
cold
nights
sat
huddled
against
him
in
the
back
seat
of
the
hayden
rather
shabby
car
her
warm
ungloved
hand
in
his
it
was
marion
who
taught
him
to
mix
the
newest
of
cocktails
and
who
later
praised
his
skill
it
was
marion
who
insisted
on
his
having
a
third
too
when
the
second
had
already
set
his
ears
drumming
the
effect
on
the
boy
of
her
steady
propinquity
of
her
constant
caressing
touches
of
the
general
of
the
bars
of
restraint
was
to
rouse
in
him
impulses
of
which
he
was
only
vaguely
conscious
and
his
proposal
of
marriage
when
it
finally
came
was
by
nature
of
a
confession
he
had
kissed
her
not
for
the
first
time
but
this
time
she
had
let
him
hold
her
and
he
had
rained
kisses
on
her
face
i
want
you
he
had
said
huskily
and
even
afterward
when
the
thing
was
done
and
she
had
said
she
would
marry
him
she
had
to
ask
him
if
he
loved
her
i
of
course
i
do
he
had
said
and
had
drawn
her
back
into
his
arms
he
wanted
to
marry
her
at
once
it
was
the
strongest
urge
of
his
life
and
put
into
his
pleading
an
almost
pathetic
earnestness
but
she
was
firm
enough
now
i
do
think
your
family
will
be
crazy
about
this
you
what
do
we
care
for
the
family
they
not
marrying
you
are
they
they
will
have
to
help
to
support
me
wo
they
and
he
had
felt
a
trifle
chilled
it
was
not
a
part
of
marion
program
to
enter
the
spencer
family
unwelcomed
she
had
a
furtive
fear
of
clayton
spencer
the
fear
of
the
indirect
for
the
direct
of
the
designing
woman
for
the
essentially
simple
and
open
male
it
was
not
on
her
cards
to
marry
graham
and
to
try
to
live
on
his
salary
so
for
a
few
weeks
the
engagement
was
concealed
even
from
hayden
and
graham
who
had
received
some
stock
from
his
father
on
his
birthday
secretly
sold
a
few
shares
and
bought
the
engagement
ring
with
that
marion
breather
easier
it
was
absolute
evidence
her
methods
were
the
methods
of
her
kind
and
her
time
to
allure
a
man
by
every
wile
she
knew
and
having
won
him
to
keep
him
uncertain
and
uneasy
was
her
perfectly
simple
creed
so
she
reduced
love
to
its
cheapest
terms
passion
and
jealousy
played
on
them
both
and
made
graham
alternately
happy
and
wretched
once
he
found
rodney
page
there
lounging
about
with
the
manner
of
a
habitue
it
seemed
to
graham
that
he
was
always
stumbling
over
rodney
those
days
either
at
home
with
drawings
and
color
sketches
spread
out
before
him
or
at
the
hayden
house
what
he
hanging
around
here
for
he
demanded
when
rodney
having
bent
over
marion
hand
and
kissed
it
had
gone
away
if
he
could
see
that
bare
spot
on
the
top
of
his
head
he
stop
all
that
you
being
rather
vulgar
are
you
marion
had
said
he
a
very
old
friend
and
a
very
dear
probably
in
love
with
you
once
like
all
the
rest
he
had
expected
denial
from
her
but
she
had
held
her
cigaret
up
in
the
air
and
reflectively
regarded
its
small
gilt
tip
i
afraid
he
rather
unhappy
poor
rod
about
me
about
look
here
toots
he
burst
out
i
playing
square
with
you
i
never
go
anywhere
but
here
i
i
perfectly
straight
with
you
but
every
time
here
i
find
some
of
your
old
guard
hanging
round
it
makes
me
they
always
come
here
and
as
long
as
our
engagement
is
known
i
ca
very
well
stop
then
let
me
go
to
he
turn
you
out
you
know
i
know
men
dear
old
thing
and
father
is
going
to
raise
a
merry
little
hell
about
us
he
the
sort
who
wants
to
choose
his
son
wife
for
him
he
like
to
play
she
watched
him
smiling
but
with
slightly
narrowed
eyes
i
rather
think
he
has
somebody
in
mind
for
you
i
do
believe
of
course
you
do
but
he
who
delight
she
exactly
the
sort
he
thinks
you
need
he
still
thinks
you
are
a
little
boy
graham
so
he
picks
out
a
nice
little
girl
for
you
such
a
nice
little
the
amused
contempt
in
her
voice
made
him
angry
for
delight
rather
than
himself
he
was
extremely
and
dignified
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
he
stood
very
tall
and
straight
and
spoke
in
his
deepest
voice
it
became
rather
an
obsession
in
him
to
prove
his
manhood
and
added
to
that
was
the
effect
of
marion
constant
insidious
appeal
to
the
surging
blood
of
his
youth
and
day
after
day
he
was
shut
in
his
office
with
anna
klein
he
thought
he
was
madly
in
love
with
marion
he
knew
that
he
was
not
at
all
in
love
with
anna
klein
but
she
helped
to
relieve
the
office
tedium
he
was
often
aware
sitting
at
his
desk
with
anna
before
him
notebook
in
hand
that
while
he
read
his
letters
her
eyes
were
on
him
more
than
once
he
met
them
and
there
was
something
in
them
that
healed
his
wounded
vanity
he
was
a
man
to
her
he
was
indeed
almost
a
god
but
that
he
did
not
know
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
he
would
have
accepted
even
that
however
then
one
day
he
kissed
her
she
was
standing
very
close
and
the
impulse
was
quick
and
irresistible
she
made
no
effort
to
leave
his
arms
and
he
kissed
her
again
like
me
a
little
do
you
he
had
asked
smiling
into
her
eyes
oh
i
do
i
do
she
had
replied
hoarsely
it
was
almost
an
exact
reversal
of
his
relationship
with
marion
there
the
huskiness
was
his
the
triumphant
smile
was
marion
and
the
feeling
of
being
adored
without
stint
or
reservation
warmed
him
he
released
her
then
but
their
relationship
had
taken
on
a
new
phase
he
would
stand
against
the
outer
door
to
prevent
its
sudden
opening
and
she
would
walk
toward
him
frightened
and
helpless
until
his
arms
closed
about
her
it
was
entirely
a
game
to
him
there
were
days
when
marion
was
trying
or
the
work
of
his
department
was
nagging
him
when
he
scarcely
noticed
her
at
all
but
again
the
mischief
in
him
the
idler
the
newly
awakened
hunting
male
took
him
to
her
with
arms
outheld
and
the
look
of
triumph
in
his
eyes
that
she
mistook
for
love
on
one
such
occasion
joey
came
near
to
surprising
a
situation
so
near
that
his
sophisticated
young
mind
guessed
rather
more
than
the
truth
he
went
out
whistling
he
waited
until
graham
had
joined
the
office
force
in
the
mill
lunchroom
and
invented
an
errand
back
to
graham
office
anna
was
there
powdering
her
nose
with
the
aid
of
a
mirror
fastened
inside
her
purse
joey
had
adopted
clayton
with
a
sort
of
fierce
passion
hidden
behind
a
pose
of
patronage
he
all
right
he
would
say
to
the
boys
gathered
at
noon
in
the
mill
yard
he
kinda
sometimes
but
me
i
understand
him
and
there
ai
many
of
these
here
money
kings
that
would
sit
up
in
a
hospital
the
way
he
did
with
the
mill
yard
had
had
quite
enough
of
that
night
in
the
hospital
it
would
fall
on
him
in
one
of
those
attacks
that
are
the
humor
of
the
street
and
sometimes
it
was
rather
a
battered
joey
who
returned
to
clayton
handsome
office
to
assist
him
in
running
the
mill
but
it
was
a
very
cool
and
slightly
scornful
joey
who
confronted
anna
that
noon
hour
he
lost
no
time
in
preliminaries
what
do
you
think
you
doing
anyhow
he
demanded
powdering
my
nose
if
you
insist
on
they
spoke
the
same
language
anna
knew
what
was
coming
and
was
on
guard
instantly
you
cut
it
out
that
you
cut
out
of
this
office
and
that
joey
sat
down
on
graham
desk
and
folded
his
arms
what
are
you
going
to
get
out
of
it
anyhow
he
said
with
a
shift
from
bullying
to
argument
out
of
what
you
know
all
she
whirled
on
him
now
see
here
joey
she
said
you
run
out
and
play
i
not
have
any
little
boys
meddling
in
my
joey
slid
off
the
desk
and
surveyed
her
with
an
impish
smile
your
affairs
he
repeated
what
the
hell
do
i
care
about
your
affairs
thinking
of
the
boss
it
up
to
him
if
he
wants
to
keep
german
spies
on
the
place
but
it
up
to
some
of
us
here
to
keep
our
eyes
open
so
that
they
do
do
any
sheer
outrage
made
anna
face
pale
she
had
known
for
some
time
that
the
other
girls
kept
away
from
her
and
she
had
accepted
it
with
the
stolidity
of
her
blood
she
had
no
german
sympathies
her
sympathies
in
the
war
lay
nowhere
but
she
a
spy
you
get
out
of
here
she
said
furiously
or
i
go
to
spencer
and
complain
about
you
i
no
more
a
spy
than
you
are
not
as
much
the
way
you
come
sneaking
around
listening
and
watching
now
you
get
and
joey
had
gone
slowly
to
show
that
the
going
was
of
his
own
free
will
and
whistling
he
went
out
and
closed
the
door
then
he
opened
it
and
stuck
his
head
in
you
be
good
he
volunteered
and
when
the
little
old
gets
to
mixing
up
with
the
swine
over
there
i
bring
you
a
nice
fat
hun
as
a
chapter
xii
two
days
before
christmas
delight
came
out
there
was
an
afternoon
reception
at
the
rectory
and
the
plain
old
house
blossomed
with
the
debutante
bouquets
and
baskets
of
flowers
for
weeks
before
the
house
had
been
getting
ready
the
rector
looking
about
for
his
accustomed
chair
had
been
told
it
was
at
the
upholsterer
or
had
found
his
beloved
and
ragged
old
books
relegated
to
dark
corners
of
the
bookcases
there
were
always
stepladders
on
the
landings
and
waiting
until
a
man
got
out
of
bed
in
the
morning
and
once
he
put
his
ecclesiastical
heel
in
a
pail
of
varnish
and
slid
down
an
entire
staircase
to
the
great
imperilment
of
his
kindly
old
soul
but
he
had
consented
without
demur
to
the
party
and
he
had
taken
during
all
the
morning
of
the
great
day
a
most
mundane
interest
in
the
boxes
of
flowers
that
came
in
every
few
minutes
he
stood
inside
a
window
under
pretense
of
having
no
place
to
sit
down
and
called
out
regularly
six
more
coming
mother
and
a
boy
with
three
ringing
across
the
street
i
think
he
made
a
mistake
yes
he
has
he
coming
over
when
all
the
stands
and
tables
were
overflowing
the
bouquets
were
hung
to
the
curtains
in
the
windows
and
delight
taking
a
last
survey
from
the
doorway
expressed
her
satisfaction
it
heavenly
she
said
imagine
all
those
flowers
for
me
it
looks
she
squinted
up
her
eyes
critically
it
looks
precisely
like
a
highly
successful
but
a
part
of
her
satisfaction
was
pure
pose
for
the
benefit
of
that
kindly
pair
who
loved
her
so
alone
in
her
room
dressed
to
go
delight
drew
a
long
breath
and
picked
up
her
flowers
which
clayton
spencer
had
sent
it
had
been
his
kindly
custom
for
years
to
send
to
each
little
debutante
as
she
made
her
bow
a
great
armful
of
white
lilacs
and
trailing
tiny
white
rosebuds
fifty
dollars
probably
delight
reflected
and
the
belgians
needing
flannels
it
her
resentment
against
graham
was
dying
after
all
he
was
only
a
child
in
toots
hayden
hands
and
she
made
one
of
those
curious
arrangements
in
her
own
mind
if
graham
came
that
afternoon
she
would
take
it
as
a
sign
that
there
was
still
some
good
in
him
and
she
would
try
to
save
him
from
himself
she
had
been
rather
nasty
to
him
if
he
did
not
come
a
great
many
came
mostly
women
with
a
sprinkling
of
men
the
rector
who
loved
people
was
in
his
element
he
was
proud
of
delight
proud
of
his
home
he
had
never
ceased
being
proud
of
his
wife
he
knew
who
exactly
had
sent
each
basket
of
flowers
each
hanging
bunch
your
exquisite
orchids
he
would
say
or
that
perfectly
charming
basket
it
is
there
just
beside
but
when
natalie
spencer
came
in
alone
splendid
in
russian
sables
he
happened
to
be
looking
at
delight
and
he
saw
the
light
die
out
of
her
eyes
natalie
had
tried
to
bring
graham
with
her
she
had
gone
into
his
room
that
morning
while
he
was
dressing
and
asked
him
to
tell
the
truth
she
was
uneasy
about
marion
hayden
and
his
growing
intimacy
there
you
will
wo
you
graham
dear
sorry
mother
i
just
ca
i
taking
a
girl
i
suppose
it
her
tone
caused
him
to
turn
and
look
at
her
yes
it
marion
what
wrong
with
that
it
so
silly
graham
she
older
than
you
are
and
she
not
really
nice
graham
i
do
mean
anything
horrid
but
she
designing
she
knows
you
are
young
and
well
she
just
playing
with
you
i
know
girls
graham
i
she
stopped
before
his
angry
gaze
she
is
nice
enough
for
you
to
ask
here
he
said
hastily
she
wants
your
money
that
he
had
laughed
then
an
ugly
laugh
there
a
lot
of
it
for
her
to
and
natalie
had
gone
away
to
shed
tears
of
fury
and
resentment
in
her
own
room
she
was
really
frightened
bills
for
flowers
sent
to
marion
were
coming
in
to
lie
unpaid
on
graham
writing
table
she
had
once
again
to
pay
them
and
other
bills
for
theater
tickets
checks
signed
at
restaurants
club
accounts
so
she
went
to
the
haverfords
alone
and
managed
very
effectually
to
snub
hayden
before
the
rector
very
eyes
hayden
thereupon
followed
an
impulse
if
it
were
not
for
natalie
spencer
she
said
following
that
sables
with
malevolent
eyes
i
should
be
very
happy
in
something
i
want
to
tell
you
can
we
find
a
corner
somewhere
and
doctor
haverford
had
followed
her
uneasily
behind
some
palms
she
was
a
thin
little
woman
with
a
maddening
habit
of
drawing
her
tight
veil
down
even
closer
by
a
contortion
of
her
lower
jaw
so
that
the
rector
found
himself
watching
her
chin
rather
than
her
eyes
i
want
you
to
know
right
away
as
marion
clergyman
and
ours
she
had
said
and
had
given
her
jaw
a
particularly
vicious
wag
and
twist
of
course
it
is
not
announced
i
do
believe
even
the
spencers
know
it
yet
i
am
only
telling
you
now
because
i
know
how
dearly
she
did
it
again
how
dearly
interested
you
are
in
all
your
spiritual
children
marion
is
engaged
to
graham
the
rector
had
not
been
a
shining
light
for
years
without
learning
how
to
control
his
expression
he
had
a
second
too
while
she
contorted
her
face
again
to
recover
himself
thank
you
he
said
gravely
i
much
appreciate
your
telling
hayden
had
lowered
her
voice
still
more
the
revelation
took
on
the
appearance
of
conspiracy
in
the
early
spring
probably
she
said
we
shall
need
your
services
and
your
so
that
was
the
end
of
one
dream
he
had
dreamed
so
many
in
his
youth
of
spiritualizing
his
worldly
flock
in
middle
life
of
a
bishopric
he
had
dreamed
of
sons
to
carry
on
the
name
he
had
meant
to
make
famous
but
the
failures
of
those
dreams
had
been
at
once
his
own
failure
and
his
own
disappointment
this
was
different
he
was
profoundly
depressed
he
wandered
out
of
the
crowd
and
after
colliding
with
a
man
from
the
caterer
in
a
dark
rear
hall
found
his
way
up
the
servant
staircase
to
the
small
back
room
where
he
kept
the
lares
and
penates
of
his
quiet
life
his
pipe
his
fishing
rods
a
shabby
old
smoking
coat
and
back
files
of
magazines
which
he
intended
some
day
to
read
when
he
got
round
to
it
the
little
room
was
jammed
with
old
furniture
stripped
from
the
lower
floor
to
make
room
for
the
crowd
he
had
to
get
down
on
his
knees
and
crawl
under
a
table
to
reach
his
pipe
but
he
achieved
it
finally
still
with
an
air
of
abstraction
and
lighted
it
then
as
there
was
no
place
to
sit
down
he
stood
in
the
center
of
the
little
room
and
thought
he
did
not
go
down
again
he
heard
the
noise
of
the
arriving
and
departing
motors
subside
its
replacement
by
the
sound
of
clattering
china
being
washed
below
in
the
pantry
he
went
down
finally
to
be
served
with
a
meal
largely
supplemented
by
the
of
the
afternoon
refreshments
ornate
salads
fancy
ices
and
an
overwhelming
table
decoration
that
shut
him
off
from
his
wife
and
delight
and
left
him
in
magnificent
solitude
behind
a
pyramid
of
flowers
bits
of
the
afternoon
gossip
reached
him
the
comments
on
dress
and
her
flowers
the
reasons
certain
people
had
not
come
but
nothing
of
the
subject
nearest
his
heart
at
the
end
of
the
meal
delight
got
up
i
going
to
call
up
spencer
she
said
he
has
about
fifty
dollars
worth
of
thanks
coming
to
i
did
see
graham
said
haverford
was
he
here
delight
stood
poised
for
flight
he
could
come
because
he
had
enough
to
do
being
two
places
at
once
his
mother
said
he
was
working
and
hayden
said
he
had
taken
marion
to
the
country
club
i
do
know
why
they
take
the
trouble
to
lie
to
chapter
xiii
christmas
day
of
the
year
of
our
lord
dawned
on
a
world
which
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
man
of
peace
in
asia
minor
the
allies
celebrated
it
by
the
capture
of
a
strong
turkish
position
at
maghdadah
the
germans
spent
it
concentrating
at
dead
man
hill
the
british
were
ejected
from
enemy
positions
near
arras
there
was
no
christmas
truce
the
had
come
germany
conscious
of
her
superiority
in
men
and
her
hypocritical
peace
offers
unanimously
rejected
was
preparing
to
free
herself
from
the
last
restraint
of
civilization
and
to
begin
unrestricted
submarine
warfare
on
christmas
morning
clayton
received
a
letter
from
chris
evidently
it
had
come
by
hand
for
it
was
mailed
in
america
dear
clay
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
you
will
care
to
hear
from
me
in
fact
i
have
tried
two
or
three
times
to
write
to
you
and
have
given
it
up
but
i
am
lonelier
than
and
if
it
were
not
for
audrey
letters
i
would
care
which
shell
got
me
and
my
little
cart
i
do
know
whether
you
know
why
i
got
out
or
not
perhaps
you
do
i
been
a
fool
and
a
scoundrel
and
i
had
time
between
fusses
to
know
just
how
rotten
i
been
but
i
not
going
to
whine
to
you
what
i
am
trying
to
get
over
is
that
i
through
with
the
old
stuff
for
good
god
only
knows
why
i
am
writing
to
you
anyhow
unless
it
is
because
i
always
thought
you
were
pretty
near
right
and
i
like
to
feel
that
now
and
then
you
are
seeing
audrey
and
bucking
her
up
a
bit
i
think
she
rather
down
do
you
know
clay
i
think
this
is
a
darned
critical
time
the
press
has
got
it
yet
but
both
the
british
and
the
french
are
hard
up
against
it
they
fight
until
there
is
no
one
left
to
fight
but
these
damned
germans
seem
to
have
no
they
have
any
temperament
i
daresay
or
maybe
it
is
soul
they
lack
but
they
fight
to
the
last
man
also
and
the
plain
truth
is
that
there
are
too
many
of
them
it
looks
mighty
bad
unless
we
come
in
and
i
do
mind
saying
that
there
are
a
good
many
eyes
over
here
straining
across
the
old
atlantic
are
we
doing
anything
i
wonder
getting
ready
the
officers
here
say
we
ca
expand
an
army
to
get
enough
men
without
a
draft
law
can
you
see
the
administration
endangering
the
next
election
with
a
draft
law
not
on
your
life
i
on
the
wagon
clay
honestly
it
funny
i
do
mind
telling
you
i
darned
miserable
sometimes
but
then
i
get
busy
and
i
so
blooming
glad
in
a
rush
to
get
water
that
does
smell
to
heaven
that
i
want
anything
else
i
suppose
they
give
us
a
good
hate
on
christmas
well
think
of
me
sometimes
when
you
sit
down
to
dinner
and
you
might
drink
to
our
coming
in
if
we
have
a
principle
to
divide
among
us
we
shall
have
clayton
read
the
letter
twice
he
and
natalie
lunched
alone
natalie
in
radiant
good
humor
his
gift
to
her
had
been
a
high
collar
of
small
diamonds
magnificently
set
and
natalie
whose
throat
commenced
to
worry
her
had
welcomed
it
rapturously
also
he
had
that
morning
notified
graham
that
his
salary
had
been
raised
to
five
thousand
dollars
graham
had
shown
relief
rather
than
pleasure
i
daresay
i
wo
earn
it
father
he
had
said
but
i
at
east
try
to
keep
out
of
debt
on
if
you
ca
better
let
me
be
your
banker
the
boy
had
flushed
then
he
had
disappeared
as
usual
and
clayton
and
natalie
sat
across
from
each
other
in
their
lion
chairs
and
made
a
pretense
of
christmas
gayety
true
to
natalie
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
a
small
nuremberg
christmas
tree
hung
with
tiny
toys
and
lighted
with
small
candles
stood
in
the
center
of
the
table
we
are
dining
out
she
explained
so
i
thought
we
use
it
it
very
pretty
clayton
acknowledged
and
he
wondered
if
natalie
felt
at
all
as
he
did
the
vast
room
and
the
two
men
serving
with
graham
no
one
knew
where
and
that
travesty
of
christmas
joy
between
them
his
mind
wandered
to
long
ago
christmases
it
not
so
very
long
since
we
had
a
real
tree
he
observed
do
you
remember
the
one
that
fell
and
smashed
all
the
things
on
it
and
how
graham
heard
it
and
came
down
horribly
messy
things
said
natalie
and
watched
the
second
man
critically
he
was
new
and
she
decided
he
was
awkward
she
chattered
through
the
meal
however
with
that
light
gayety
of
hers
which
was
not
gayety
at
all
and
always
of
the
country
house
the
floor
is
to
be
oak
with
a
marble
border
she
said
you
remember
the
ones
we
saw
in
italy
and
the
ceiling
is
blue
and
gold
you
love
the
ceiling
there
was
claret
with
the
luncheon
and
clayton
raising
his
glass
thought
of
chris
and
the
water
that
smelled
to
heaven
natalie
mind
was
on
loggias
by
that
time
an
upstairs
loggia
too
she
said
bordered
with
red
geraniums
i
loathe
geraniums
but
the
color
is
good
rodney
wants
japanese
screens
and
things
but
i
not
sure
what
do
you
think
i
think
you
a
better
judge
than
i
am
he
replied
smiling
he
had
had
to
come
back
a
long
way
but
he
made
the
effort
it
hardly
worth
while
struggling
to
have
things
attractive
for
you
she
observed
petulantly
you
never
notice
anyhow
clay
do
you
know
that
you
sit
hours
and
hours
and
never
talk
to
me
no
do
i
i
you
a
perfectly
dreary
person
to
have
i
talk
to
you
my
dear
but
i
not
much
good
at
houses
give
me
something
i
the
mill
i
suppose
or
the
war
do
i
really
talk
of
the
war
when
you
talk
at
all
what
in
the
world
do
you
think
about
clay
when
you
sit
with
your
eyes
on
nothing
it
a
vicious
oh
ships
and
sails
and
sealing
wax
and
cabbages
and
kings
he
said
lightly
that
afternoon
natalie
slept
and
the
house
took
on
the
quiet
of
an
establishment
where
the
first
word
in
service
is
silence
clay
wandered
about
feeling
an
inexpressible
loneliness
of
spirit
on
those
days
which
work
did
not
fill
he
was
always
discontented
he
thought
of
the
club
but
the
vision
of
those
disconsolate
groups
of
homeless
bachelors
who
gathered
there
on
all
festivals
that
centered
about
a
family
focus
was
unattractive
all
at
once
he
realized
that
since
he
had
wakened
that
morning
he
had
been
wanting
to
see
audrey
he
wanted
to
talk
to
her
real
talk
not
gossip
not
country
houses
not
personalities
not
recrimination
such
talk
as
audrey
herself
had
always
led
at
dinner
parties
of
men
and
affairs
of
big
issues
of
the
war
he
felt
suddenly
that
he
must
talk
about
the
war
to
some
one
natalie
was
still
sleeping
when
he
went
it
had
been
raining
but
a
cold
wind
was
covering
the
pavement
with
a
glaze
of
ice
here
and
there
men
in
top
hats
like
himself
were
making
their
way
to
christmas
calls
children
clinging
to
the
arms
of
governesses
their
feet
in
high
arctics
slid
laughing
on
the
ice
a
belated
wagon
was
still
delivering
christmas
plants
tied
with
bright
red
bows
the
street
held
more
of
festivity
to
clayton
than
had
his
house
even
the
shop
windows
as
he
walked
toward
audrey
unfashionable
new
neighborhood
cried
out
their
message
of
peace
peace
when
there
was
no
peace
audrey
was
alone
but
her
little
room
was
crowded
with
gifts
and
flowers
i
was
hoping
you
would
come
clay
she
said
i
had
some
visitors
but
they
gone
i
tell
them
that
i
not
at
home
and
we
can
really
that
what
i
came
and
when
she
had
telephoned
i
had
a
letter
from
chris
she
read
it
slowly
and
he
was
surprised
when
she
finally
looked
up
to
find
tears
in
her
eyes
poor
old
chris
she
said
i
never
told
you
the
story
have
i
clay
of
course
i
know
perfectly
well
i
have
there
was
another
woman
i
think
i
could
have
understood
it
perhaps
if
she
had
been
a
different
sort
of
a
woman
but
i
suppose
it
hurt
my
pride
i
love
him
she
was
such
a
vulgar
little
thing
not
even
pretty
just
he
nodded
he
was
fastidious
too
i
do
understand
it
and
he
swears
he
never
cared
for
her
i
do
believe
he
did
either
i
suppose
there
no
explanation
for
these
things
they
just
happen
it
the
life
we
live
i
dare
say
when
i
look
back
she
the
girl
i
sent
into
the
he
was
distinctly
shocked
but
audrey
he
protested
you
are
not
seeing
her
are
you
now
and
then
she
has
fastened
herself
on
me
in
a
way
do
scowl
like
that
she
says
she
is
straight
now
and
that
she
only
wants
a
chance
to
work
she
off
the
stage
for
good
she
danced
that
money
i
got
from
you
was
for
her
she
was
waiting
chris
was
behind
with
her
rent
and
she
was
going
to
lose
her
that
you
should
have
to
do
such
a
thing
he
protested
it
well
it
but
she
only
smiled
well
i
never
been
particularly
shielded
it
has
hurt
me
i
even
hate
her
but
i
puzzled
sometimes
where
there
love
it
might
be
understandable
most
of
us
would
hate
to
have
to
stand
the
test
of
real
love
i
daresay
there
a
time
in
every
one
life
i
suppose
when
love
seems
to
be
the
only
thing
that
that
was
what
the
poet
in
that
idiotic
book
had
said
there
is
no
other
even
you
clay
she
reflected
smilingly
you
big
grave
men
go
all
to
pieces
i
never
have
he
retorted
she
returned
chris
letter
to
him
there
she
said
i
had
my
little
whimper
and
i
feel
better
now
talk
to
the
little
clock
was
striking
six
when
at
last
he
rose
to
go
the
room
was
dark
with
only
the
glow
of
the
wood
fire
on
audrey
face
he
found
her
very
lovely
rather
chastened
and
subdued
but
much
more
appealing
than
in
her
old
days
of
sparkle
and
high
spirits
you
are
looking
very
sweet
am
i
how
nice
of
you
she
got
up
and
stood
on
the
beside
him
looking
up
at
him
then
do
be
startled
clay
she
announced
smilingly
i
am
going
to
kiss
you
for
and
kiss
him
she
did
putting
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
rising
on
her
toes
to
do
it
it
was
a
very
small
kiss
and
clayton
took
it
calmly
and
as
she
intended
him
to
take
it
but
it
was
at
that
rather
a
flushed
audrey
who
bade
him
and
god
bless
you
clayton
took
away
with
him
from
that
visit
a
great
peace
and
a
great
relief
he
had
talked
out
to
her
for
more
than
an
hour
of
the
many
things
that
puzzled
and
bewildered
him
he
had
talked
war
and
the
mill
and
even
graham
and
his
problems
and
by
talking
of
them
some
of
them
had
clarified
a
little
of
his
unrest
had
gone
he
felt
encouraged
he
had
a
new
strength
to
go
on
it
was
wonderful
he
reflected
what
the
friendship
of
a
woman
could
mean
to
a
man
he
was
quite
convinced
that
it
was
only
friendship
he
turned
toward
home
reluctantly
behind
him
was
the
glow
of
fire
and
the
glow
that
had
been
in
her
eyes
when
he
entered
if
a
man
had
such
a
woman
behind
him
he
went
into
his
great
silent
house
and
the
door
closed
behind
him
like
a
prison
gate
for
a
long
time
after
he
had
gone
audrey
doors
closed
to
visitors
sat
alone
by
her
fire
with
one
of
his
roses
held
close
to
her
cheek
in
her
small
upper
room
in
a
white
frame
cottage
on
the
hill
overlooking
the
spencer
furnaces
anna
klein
locked
away
from
prying
eyes
sat
that
same
christmas
evening
and
closely
inspected
a
tiny
gold
and
now
and
then
like
audrey
she
pressed
it
to
her
face
not
the
gift
but
the
giver
chapter
xiv
having
turned
dunbar
and
his
protective
league
over
to
hutchinson
the
general
manager
clayton
had
put
him
out
of
his
mind
but
during
the
week
after
christmas
he
reached
the
office
early
one
morning
to
find
that
keen
and
rather
shabby
gentleman
already
there
waiting
not
precisely
waiting
for
he
was
standing
by
one
of
the
windows
well
back
from
it
and
inspecting
the
mill
yard
with
sharp
darting
glances
hello
dunbar
said
clayton
and
proceeded
to
shed
his
coat
dunbar
turned
and
surveyed
him
with
the
grudging
admiration
of
the
undersized
man
for
the
tall
one
cold
morning
he
said
coming
forward
not
that
i
suppose
you
know
he
glanced
at
the
coat
i
thought
hutchinson
said
that
you
gone
been
to
washington
i
brought
something
back
that
will
interest
from
inside
his
coat
he
produced
a
small
leather
case
and
took
from
it
a
number
of
photographs
i
rather
gathered
spencer
he
said
dryly
when
i
was
here
last
that
you
thought
me
an
alarmist
i
do
know
that
i
blame
you
we
always
think
the
other
fellow
may
get
it
but
that
we
are
safe
you
might
glance
at
those
he
spread
them
out
on
the
desk
beyond
the
windows
the
mill
roared
on
men
shouted
the
locomotive
whistled
a
long
file
of
laborers
with
wheelbarrows
went
by
and
from
a
new
building
going
up
came
the
hammering
of
the
so
like
the
rapid
explosions
of
machine
guns
interesting
are
they
queried
dunbar
this
is
a
with
a
strap
for
carrying
it
under
a
coat
that
a
lump
of
coal
only
it
is
it
got
enough
explosive
inside
to
blow
up
a
battleship
it
meant
for
that
primarily
that
damnable
stuff
understand
it
what
burned
up
most
of
belgium
and
that
a
what
do
you
think
of
that
use
one
yourself
do
you
do
leave
it
lying
around
that
what
on
earth
can
they
do
with
a
one
of
their
best
little
tricks
said
dunbar
with
a
note
of
grudging
admiration
in
his
voice
here
a
cut
of
the
mechanism
you
sit
down
dip
your
pen
and
commence
to
write
there
the
striking
pin
or
whatever
they
call
it
it
hits
here
and
good
night
do
you
mean
to
say
they
using
things
like
that
here
i
mean
to
say
they
planning
to
if
they
have
already
that
coal
now
you
see
that
go
into
your
furnaces
or
under
your
boilers
or
wherever
you
use
it
and
would
worry
would
you
are
these
actual
photographs
made
from
articles
taken
from
a
german
officer
trunk
in
a
neutral
country
he
was
on
his
way
somewhere
i
clayton
sat
silent
then
he
took
out
his
and
surveyed
it
with
a
smile
rather
off
for
a
time
i
take
it
observed
dunbar
well
i
something
else
for
you
you
got
one
of
the
best
little
workers
in
the
country
right
here
in
your
mill
some
of
them
are
so
bad
hot
air
and
nothing
else
but
this
fellow
a
fanatic
which
is
the
same
as
saying
he
who
is
he
name
rudolph
klein
he
a
sort
of
relation
to
the
chap
that
got
out
old
man
been
sore
on
him
but
i
understand
he
hanging
around
the
klein
place
clayton
considered
i
do
remember
him
of
course
i
ca
keep
track
of
the
men
get
rid
of
dunbar
eyed
him
that
the
best
thing
you
can
think
of
i
do
want
him
round
do
i
nine
of
you
men
out
of
ten
say
that
you
turn
him
loose
and
so
warn
him
not
only
that
but
he
be
off
on
his
devil
work
somewhere
perhaps
here
perhaps
elsewhere
and
we
want
him
where
we
can
find
him
see
here
spencer
ever
hear
of
clayton
never
had
but
the
term
explained
itself
set
a
spy
to
watch
a
spy
said
dunbar
let
him
think
he
going
on
fine
find
his
confederates
let
them
get
ready
to
spring
something
and
then
get
them
remember
he
added
with
sarcasm
we
still
neutral
you
ca
lock
a
man
up
because
he
goes
around
yelling
with
capital
the
whole
country
is
ready
to
yell
it
with
him
and
even
if
you
find
him
with
a
bomb
under
his
coat
labeled
in
germany
hard
to
link
germans
up
with
the
thing
he
can
say
that
he
always
buys
his
bombs
in
germany
that
they
make
the
best
bombs
in
the
world
that
he
likes
the
way
they
pack
and
their
polite
trade
clayton
listened
thinking
hard
we
have
a
daughter
of
klein
here
she
is
my
son
dunbar
glanced
at
him
quickly
but
his
eyes
were
on
the
window
i
know
think
i
should
get
rid
of
her
dunbar
hesitated
he
liked
clayton
spencer
and
it
was
his
business
just
then
to
know
something
about
the
kleins
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
clayton
spencer
boy
if
they
got
rid
of
the
girl
on
the
other
hand
to
keep
her
there
and
watch
her
was
certainly
a
bigger
thing
if
she
stayed
there
might
be
trouble
but
it
would
concern
the
boy
only
if
she
left
and
if
she
was
one
link
in
the
chain
to
snare
rudolph
there
might
be
a
disaster
costing
many
lives
he
made
his
decision
quickly
keep
her
by
all
means
he
said
and
do
tell
graham
anything
he
young
and
he
be
likely
to
show
something
i
suppose
she
gets
considerable
data
where
she
is
only
of
the
one
department
but
that
a
fair
indication
of
the
dunbar
rose
i
inclined
to
think
there
nothing
to
that
end
of
it
he
said
the
old
chap
is
sulky
but
he
not
dangerous
it
rudolph
i
afraid
at
the
luncheon
hour
that
day
clayton
having
finished
his
mail
went
to
graham
office
he
seldom
did
that
but
he
was
uneasy
he
wanted
to
see
the
girl
he
wanted
to
look
her
over
with
this
new
idea
in
his
mind
she
had
been
a
quiet
little
thing
he
remembered
thorough
but
not
brilliant
he
had
sent
her
to
graham
from
his
own
office
he
disliked
even
the
idea
of
suspecting
her
his
natural
chivalry
revolted
from
suspecting
any
woman
joey
who
customarily
ate
his
luncheon
on
clayton
desk
in
his
absence
followed
by
one
of
clayton
cigarets
watched
him
across
the
yard
and
whistled
as
he
saw
him
enter
graham
small
building
well
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
reflected
i
hope
he
coughs
before
he
goes
but
clayton
did
not
happen
to
cough
graham
office
was
empty
but
there
was
a
sound
of
voices
from
anna
klein
small
room
beyond
he
crossed
to
the
door
and
opened
it
to
stand
astonished
his
hand
on
the
anna
klein
was
seated
at
her
desk
with
her
luncheon
spread
before
her
on
a
newspaper
and
seated
on
the
desk
a
sandwich
in
one
hand
the
other
resting
on
anna
shoulder
was
graham
he
was
laughing
when
clayton
opened
the
door
but
the
smile
froze
on
his
face
he
slid
off
her
desk
want
me
father
yes
said
clayton
curtly
and
went
out
leaving
the
door
open
a
sort
of
stricken
silence
followed
his
exit
then
graham
put
down
the
sandwich
and
went
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
he
stood
just
inside
it
in
the
outer
room
rather
pale
but
looking
his
father
in
the
eyes
sorry
father
he
said
i
did
hear
you
i
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
the
boy
was
silent
to
clayton
he
looked
furtive
guilty
his
very
expression
condemned
him
far
more
than
the
incident
itself
and
clayton
along
with
his
anger
was
puzzled
as
to
his
best
course
dunbar
had
said
to
leave
the
girl
where
she
was
but
was
it
feasible
under
these
circumstances
he
was
rather
irritated
than
angry
he
considered
a
flirtation
with
one
stenographer
rotten
bad
taste
at
any
time
the
business
world
to
his
mind
was
divided
into
two
kinds
of
men
those
who
did
that
sort
of
thing
and
those
who
did
not
it
was
a
code
rather
than
a
creed
that
the
boy
had
violated
besides
he
had
bad
a
surprise
the
girl
who
sat
laughing
into
face
was
not
the
anna
klein
he
remembered
a
shy
drab
little
thing
badly
dressed
rather
sallow
and
unsmiling
here
was
a
young
woman
undeniably
attractive
slightly
rouged
trim
in
her
white
blouse
and
with
an
air
of
piquancy
that
was
added
had
he
known
it
by
the
large
imitation
pearl
earrings
she
wore
get
your
hat
and
go
to
lunch
graham
he
said
and
you
might
try
to
remember
that
a
slightly
different
standard
of
conduct
is
expected
from
my
son
here
than
may
be
the
standard
of
some
of
the
other
it
does
mean
anything
that
sort
of
you
and
i
may
know
that
the
girl
may
then
he
went
out
and
graham
returned
unhappily
to
the
inner
room
anna
was
not
crying
she
was
too
frightened
to
cry
she
had
sat
without
moving
her
hand
still
clutching
her
untouched
sandwich
graham
looked
at
her
and
tried
to
smile
i
gone
i
suppose
do
you
worry
about
that
he
said
with
boyish
bravado
do
you
worry
about
that
little
father
will
kill
me
she
whispered
he
queer
these
days
and
if
i
go
home
and
have
to
tell
him
she
shuddered
i
see
you
get
something
else
if
the
worst
comes
you
she
glanced
up
at
him
with
that
look
of
fidelity
that
always
touched
him
i
find
you
something
good
he
promised
something
good
she
repeated
with
sudden
bitterness
and
you
get
another
girl
here
and
flirt
with
her
and
make
her
crazy
about
you
and
honestly
do
you
like
me
like
that
i
just
mad
about
you
she
said
miserably
frightened
though
he
was
her
wretchedness
appealed
to
him
the
thought
that
she
cared
for
him
too
was
a
salve
to
his
outraged
pride
a
moment
ago
in
the
other
room
he
had
felt
like
a
bad
small
boy
as
with
marion
anna
made
him
feel
every
inch
a
man
but
she
gave
him
what
marion
did
not
the
feeling
of
her
complete
surrender
marion
would
take
this
girl
would
give
he
bent
down
and
put
his
arms
around
her
poor
little
girl
he
said

girl

leading
a
cloistered
life
impossible
selfish
and
audrey
was
not
cut
out
for
solitude
she
did
not
mind
poverty
she
found
it
rather
a
relief
to
acknowledge
what
had
always
been
the
fact
but
she
did
mind
loneliness
and
her
idea
of
making
herself
over
into
something
useful
was
not
working
out
particularly
well
she
spent
two
hours
a
day
at
a
school
struggling
with
shorthand
and
her
was
always
littered
with
papers
covered
with
queer
hooks
and
curves
or
with
typed
sheets
beginning
messrs
smith
and
dear
clayton
spencer
met
her
late
in
december
walking
feverishly
along
with
a
book
under
her
arm
and
a
look
in
her
eyes
he
felt
a
little
thrill
when
he
saw
her
which
should
have
warned
him
but
did
not
she
did
not
even
greet
him
she
stopped
and
held
out
her
book
to
him
take
it
she
said
i
thrown
it
away
twice
and
two
wretched
men
have
run
after
me
and
brought
it
he
took
it
and
glanced
at
it
spelling
ca
you
spell
certainly
i
can
spell
she
said
with
dignity
i
a
very
good
speller
clay
there
is
an
in
business
is
there
it
is
generally
considered
necessary
to
have
two
pretty
good
eyes
in
but
he
saw
then
that
she
was
really
rather
despairing
there
is
one
he
said
it
seems
foolish
does
it
audrey
dear
what
are
you
trying
to
do
for
heaven
sake
if
it
money
it
is
that
i
have
enough
honestly
clay
i
just
had
some
sort
of
an
idea
that
i
been
playing
long
enough
but
i
only
good
for
play
that
man
this
morning
said
as
much
when
we
fussed
about
my
spelling
he
said
i
better
write
a
new
clayton
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
and
after
a
moment
she
laughed
too
but
as
he
went
on
his
face
was
grave
somebody
ought
to
be
looking
after
her
it
was
not
for
some
time
that
he
realized
he
carried
the
absurd
little
he
took
it
back
to
the
office
with
him
and
put
it
in
the
back
of
a
drawer
of
his
desk
joey
coming
in
some
time
later
found
him
with
the
drawer
open
and
something
in
his
hands
which
he
hastily
put
away
later
on
joey
investigated
that
drawer
and
found
the
little
book
he
inspected
it
with
a
mixture
of
surprise
and
scorn
spelling
he
muttered
and
a
hundred
dollar
a
month
girl
to
spell
for
him
it
was
rodney
page
who
forced
audrey
out
of
her
seclusion
rodney
had
had
a
prosperous
year
and
for
some
time
his
conscience
had
been
bothering
him
for
a
good
many
years
he
had
blithely
accepted
the
invitations
of
his
friends
dinners
balls
and
yachting
parties
paying
his
way
with
an
occasional
box
of
flowers
he
decided
that
last
winter
of
peace
to
turn
host
and
true
to
instinct
to
do
the
unusual
it
was
natalie
who
gave
him
the
suggestion
why
do
you
turn
your
into
a
studio
and
give
a
studio
warming
roddie
it
would
be
fun
fixing
it
up
and
you
might
make
it
fancy
before
long
of
course
he
had
accepted
the
idea
as
of
his
own
originating
and
was
hard
at
work
rodney
house
had
been
his
father
he
still
lived
there
although
the
business
district
had
encroached
closely
and
for
some
time
he
had
used
the
large
stable
and
at
the
rear
as
a
place
in
which
to
store
the
odd
bits
of
furniture
old
mirrors
and
odds
and
ends
that
he
had
picked
up
here
and
there
now
and
then
as
to
natalie
he
sold
some
of
them
but
he
was
a
collector
not
a
merchant
in
his
way
he
was
an
artist
in
the
upper
floor
he
had
built
a
skylight
and
there
in
odd
hours
he
worked
out
in
sketches
of
interiors
sometimes
for
houses
he
was
building
sometimes
purely
for
the
pleasure
of
the
thing
the
war
had
brought
him
enormous
increase
in
his
collection
owners
of
french
chateaus
driven
to
poverty
were
sending
to
america
treasures
of
all
sorts
of
furniture
tapestries
carpets
old
fountains
porcelains
even
carved
woodwork
and
ancient
mantels
and
rodney
from
the
mixed
motives
of
business
and
pride
decided
to
exhibit
them
the
old
brick
floor
of
the
stable
he
replaced
with
handmade
tiles
the
were
small
hung
with
tapestries
and
lighted
with
candles
in
old
french
sconces
the
great
became
a
refectory
with
jacobean
and
old
monastery
chairs
and
the
vast
loft
overhead
reached
by
a
narrow
staircase
that
clung
to
the
wall
was
railed
on
its
exposed
side
waxed
as
to
floor
hung
with
lanterns
and
became
a
ballroom
natalie
worked
with
him
spending
much
time
and
a
prodigious
amount
of
energy
there
was
springing
up
between
them
one
of
those
curious
and
dangerous
intimacies
of
idleness
on
the
woman
part
of
admiration
on
the
man
which
sometimes
develop
into
a
wholly
spurious
passion
probably
rodney
realized
it
certainly
natalie
did
not
she
liked
his
admiration
she
dressed
each
day
for
rodney
unfailing
comment
on
her
clothes
clay
never
notices
what
i
wear
she
said
once
plaintively
so
it
was
rodney
who
brought
audrey
valentine
out
of
her
seclusion
and
he
did
it
by
making
her
angry
he
dropped
in
to
see
her
between
christmas
and
and
made
a
plea
a
she
said
how
interesting
and
fancy
dress
are
you
going
to
have
them
come
as
grooms
or
jockeys
if
i
were
going
i
go
as
a
i
used
to
be
able
to
stand
up
on
a
running
horse
of
course
you
having
horses
what
a
stable
without
a
horse
he
saw
she
was
laughing
at
him
and
was
rather
resentful
i
told
you
i
have
made
it
into
a
but
when
he
implored
her
to
go
she
was
obdurate
do
go
away
and
let
me
alone
rodney
she
said
at
last
i
loathe
it
wo
be
a
party
without
then
do
have
it
i
told
you
over
and
over
i
not
going
out
it
is
decent
this
year
in
my
opinion
and
anyhow
i
have
any
money
any
clothes
any
anything
a
bad
evening
at
bridge
and
i
should
be
able
to
pay
my
that
nonsense
why
do
you
let
people
say
you
are
moping
about
chris
you
of
course
she
sat
up
what
else
are
they
saying
well
there
some
talk
naturally
you
ca
be
as
popular
as
you
have
been
and
then
just
drop
out
without
some
gossip
it
not
what
sort
of
talk
he
was
very
uncomfortable
well
of
course
you
have
been
pretty
strong
on
the
war
stuff
oh
they
think
i
sent
him
if
only
you
would
hide
audrey
that
what
has
made
the
talk
not
chris
i
not
hiding
that
idiotic
i
was
bored
to
death
if
you
want
the
truth
look
here
rodney
you
not
being
honest
what
do
they
say
about
chris
and
myself
he
was
cornered
is
it
about
another
woman
well
of
course
now
and
then
there
are
always
such
stories
and
of
course
chris
yes
they
knew
her
voice
was
scornful
so
they
think
moping
and
hiding
because
how
interesting
she
sat
back
with
her
old
insolent
smile
poor
chris
she
said
the
only
man
in
the
lot
except
clay
spencer
who
is
doing
his
bit
for
the
war
and
they
when
is
your
party
roddie
i
come
she
said
and
smiling
again
dangerously
i
come
with
bells
chapter
xvi
there
had
been
once
in
herman
klein
the
making
of
a
good
american
he
had
come
to
america
not
at
the
call
of
freedom
but
of
peace
and
plenty
nevertheless
he
had
possibilities
taken
in
time
he
might
have
become
a
good
american
but
nothing
was
done
to
stimulate
in
him
a
sentiment
for
his
adopted
land
he
would
indeed
have
been
for
all
his
citizenship
papers
a
man
without
a
country
but
for
one
thing
the
fatherland
had
never
let
go
when
he
went
to
the
turnverein
it
was
to
hear
the
old
tongue
to
sing
the
old
songs
visiting
germans
from
overseas
were
constantly
lecturing
holding
before
him
the
vision
of
great
germany
he
saw
of
germany
he
went
to
meetings
which
commenced
with
die
wacht
am
one
christmas
he
received
a
handsome
copy
of
a
photograph
of
the
kaiser
through
the
mail
he
never
knew
who
sent
it
but
he
had
it
framed
in
a
gilt
frame
and
it
hung
over
the
fireplace
in
the
he
had
been
adopted
by
america
but
he
had
not
adopted
america
save
his
own
tiny
bit
of
it
he
took
what
the
new
country
gave
him
with
no
faintest
sense
that
he
owed
anything
in
return
beyond
his
small
yearly
taxes
he
was
neither
friendly
nor
inimical
his
creed
through
the
years
had
been
simple
to
owe
no
man
money
even
for
a
day
to
spend
less
than
he
earned
to
own
his
own
home
to
rise
early
work
hard
and
to
live
at
peace
with
his
neighbors
he
had
learned
english
and
had
sent
anna
to
the
public
school
he
spoke
english
with
her
always
and
on
sunday
he
put
on
his
best
clothes
and
sat
in
the
german
lutheran
church
dozing
occasionally
but
always
rigidly
erect
with
his
first
savings
he
had
bought
a
home
a
tiny
frame
cottage
on
a
bill
above
the
spencer
mill
with
a
bit
of
waste
land
that
he
turned
into
a
thrifty
garden
anna
was
born
there
and
her
mother
had
died
there
ten
years
later
but
long
enough
before
that
he
had
added
four
rooms
and
bought
an
adjoining
lot
at
that
time
the
hill
had
been
green
the
way
to
the
little
white
house
had
been
along
and
up
a
winding
path
where
in
the
spring
the
early
wild
flowers
came
out
on
sunny
banks
and
the
first
buds
of
the
neighborhood
were
on
klein
own
he
had
had
a
magnificent
sense
of
independence
those
days
and
of
freedom
he
voted
religiously
and
now
and
then
in
the
evenings
he
had
been
the
moderate
member
of
a
mild
socialist
group
theoretically
he
believed
that
no
man
should
amass
a
fortune
by
the
labor
of
others
actually
he
felt
himself
well
paid
a
respected
member
of
society
and
a
property
owner
in
the
early
morning
winter
and
summer
he
emerged
into
the
small
side
porch
of
his
cottage
and
there
threw
over
himself
a
pail
of
cold
water
from
the
well
outside
then
he
rubbed
down
dressed
in
the
open
air
behind
the
old
awning
hung
there
took
a
dozen
deep
breaths
and
a
cup
of
coffee
and
was
off
for
work
the
addition
of
a
bathroom
with
running
hot
water
had
made
no
change
in
his
daily
habits
he
was
very
strict
with
anna
and
with
the
women
who
one
after
another
kept
house
for
him
i
have
no
men
lounging
around
was
his
first
instruction
on
engaging
them
and
to
anna
his
solicitude
took
the
form
almost
of
espionage
the
only
young
man
he
tolerated
about
the
place
was
a
distant
relative
rudolph
klein
on
sunday
evenings
rudolph
came
in
to
supper
but
even
rudolph
found
it
hard
to
get
a
word
with
the
girl
alone
what
eating
him
anyhow
he
demanded
of
anna
one
sunday
evening
when
by
the
accident
of
a
neighbor
calling
old
herman
to
the
gate
he
had
the
chance
of
a
word
he
knows
a
lot
about
you
fellows
anna
had
said
and
the
more
he
knows
the
less
he
trusts
you
i
do
he
has
anything
on
but
anna
had
come
to
the
limit
of
her
patience
with
her
father
at
last
what
the
matter
with
you
she
demanded
angrily
one
night
when
herman
had
sat
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
had
refused
her
permission
to
go
to
the
with
another
girl
do
you
think
i
going
on
forever
like
this
without
a
chance
to
play
i
sick
of
it
that
you
vill
not
run
around
with
the
girls
on
this
he
had
conquered
all
but
the
english
he
still
pronounced
it
like
a
what
the
matter
with
the
girls
on
this
hill
and
when
he
smoked
on
in
imperturbable
silence
she
had
flamed
into
a
fury
this
is
free
america
she
reminded
him
it
not
germany
and
stood
about
all
i
can
i
work
all
day
and
i
need
a
little
fun
and
she
had
gone
rather
shaky
as
to
the
knees
but
with
her
head
held
high
leaving
him
on
the
little
veranda
with
his
dead
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
his
newspaper
held
before
his
face
she
had
returned
still
terrified
to
find
the
house
dark
and
the
doors
locked
and
rather
than
confess
to
any
one
she
had
spent
the
night
in
a
chair
out
of
doors
at
dawn
she
had
heard
him
at
the
side
of
the
house
drawing
water
for
his
bath
he
had
gone
through
his
morning
program
as
usual
by
the
sounds
and
had
started
off
for
work
without
an
inquiry
about
her
only
when
she
heard
the
gate
click
had
she
hammered
at
the
front
door
and
been
admitted
by
the
untidy
servant
fine
way
to
treat
me
she
had
stormed
and
for
a
part
of
that
day
she
was
convinced
that
she
would
never
go
back
home
again
but
fear
of
her
father
was
the
strongest
emotion
she
knew
and
she
went
back
that
night
as
usual
it
not
being
herman
way
to
bother
with
greetings
she
had
passed
him
on
the
porch
without
a
word
and
that
night
winding
a
clock
before
closing
the
house
he
spoke
to
her
for
the
first
time
there
is
a
performance
at
the
turnverein
hall
night
rudolph
vill
take
i
do
like
rudolph
viii
take
you
he
had
repeated
stolidly
and
she
had
gone
he
had
no
conception
of
any
failure
in
himself
as
a
parent
he
had
the
german
idea
of
women
they
had
a
distinct
place
in
the
world
but
that
place
was
not
a
high
one
their
function
was
to
bring
children
into
the
world
they
were
breeding
animals
and
as
such
to
be
carefully
watched
and
not
particularly
trusted
they
had
no
place
in
the
affairs
of
men
outside
the
home
not
that
he
put
it
that
way
in
his
way
he
probably
loved
the
girl
but
never
once
did
he
think
of
her
as
an
intelligent
and
reasoning
creature
he
took
her
salary
gave
her
a
small
allowance
for
and
banked
the
rest
of
it
in
his
own
name
it
would
all
be
hers
some
day
so
what
difference
did
it
make
but
the
direst
want
would
not
have
made
him
touch
a
penny
of
it
he
disliked
animals
but
in
a
curious
fashion
he
liked
flowers
such
portions
of
his
garden
as
were
useless
for
vegetables
he
had
planted
out
in
flowers
but
he
never
cut
them
and
brought
them
into
the
house
and
he
watched
jealously
that
no
one
else
should
do
so
he
kept
poisoned
meat
around
for
such
dogs
in
the
neighborhood
as
wandered
in
and
anna
had
found
him
once
callously
watching
the
death
agonies
of
one
of
them
such
at
the
time
the
spencer
mill
began
work
on
its
new
shell
contract
was
herman
klein
sturdily
honest
just
according
to
his
ideas
of
justice
callous
rather
than
cruel
but
the
citizen
of
a
world
bounded
by
his
memories
of
germany
his
life
at
the
mill
and
his
home
but
for
all
that
he
was
not
a
man
the
german
organization
in
america
put
much
faith
in
rudolph
feeling
his
way
had
had
one
or
two
conversations
with
him
early
in
the
war
that
had
made
him
report
adversely
let
them
stop
all
this
fighting
herman
had
said
what
matter
now
who
commenced
it
let
them
all
stop
it
is
the
only
sure
let
them
stop
said
rudolph
easily
let
them
stop
trying
to
destroy
that
is
nonsense
herman
affirmed
sturdily
do
you
think
i
know
nothing
i
who
was
in
the
prussian
guard
for
five
years
think
you
i
know
nothing
of
the
plan
the
report
of
the
german
atrocities
however
found
him
frankly
incredulous
and
one
noon
hour
in
the
mill
having
read
the
belgian
king
statement
that
the
german
army
in
belgium
had
protected
its
advance
with
women
and
children
rudolph
found
him
tearing
the
papers
to
shreds
furiously
such
lies
he
cried
it
is
not
possible
that
they
should
be
the
sinking
of
the
lusitania
however
left
him
thoughtful
and
depressed
in
vain
rudolph
argued
with
him
they
were
warned
he
said
if
they
chose
to
take
the
chance
is
it
germany
fault
if
you
tell
me
not
to
put
my
hand
on
a
certain
piece
in
a
machine
and
i
do
it
anyhow
is
it
your
fault
if
i
lose
a
hand
old
herman
eyed
him
shrewdly
and
if
anna
had
been
on
the
ship
you
think
the
same
eh
rudolph
had
colored
for
some
time
now
rudolph
had
been
in
love
with
anna
he
had
not
had
much
encouragement
she
went
out
with
him
since
he
was
her
only
means
of
escape
but
she
treated
him
rather
cavalierly
criticized
his
clothes
and
speech
laughed
openly
at
his
occasional
lapses
into
sentiment
and
was
once
in
a
long
time
so
kind
that
she
set
his
heart
leaping
until
the
return
of
graham
spencer
all
had
gone
fairly
well
but
with
his
installment
in
the
mill
rudolph
relations
with
anna
had
changed
she
had
grown
prettier
rudolph
was
not
observant
enough
to
mark
what
made
the
change
but
he
knew
that
he
was
madder
about
her
than
ever
and
she
had
assumed
toward
him
an
attitude
of
almost
scornful
indifference
the
effect
on
his
undisciplined
young
mind
was
bad
he
had
no
suspicion
of
graham
he
only
knew
his
own
desperate
unhappiness
in
the
meetings
held
twice
weekly
in
a
hall
on
third
street
he
was
reckless
advocating
violence
constantly
the
conservative
element
watched
him
uneasily
the
others
kept
an
eye
on
him
for
future
use
the
closing
week
of
the
old
year
found
the
situation
strained
in
the
klein
house
herman
had
had
plenty
of
opportunities
for
situations
but
all
of
them
had
to
do
directly
or
indirectly
with
the
making
of
munitions
for
the
allies
old
firms
in
other
lines
were
not
taking
on
new
men
it
was
the
munition
works
that
were
increasing
their
personnel
and
by
that
time
the
determination
not
to
assist
germany
enemies
had
become
a
fixed
one
the
day
after
christmas
in
pursuit
of
this
idea
he
commanded
anna
to
leave
the
mill
but
she
had
defied
him
for
the
second
time
in
her
life
her
face
pale
to
the
lips
not
on
your
life
she
had
said
you
may
want
to
starve
i
there
is
plenty
of
other
do
you
kid
yourself
and
anyhow
i
not
looking
for
it
i
mind
working
so
you
can
sit
here
and
nurse
a
grouch
but
i
certainly
do
intend
to
start
hunting
another
she
had
eyed
him
morosely
if
you
ask
me
she
continued
you
out
of
your
mind
what
germany
to
you
you
forgot
it
as
fast
as
you
could
until
this
war
came
along
you
and
rudolph
you
long
distance
patriots
you
i
will
not
help
my
country
enemies
he
had
said
doggedly
your
country
s
enemies
my
word
is
this
your
country
what
the
old
kaiser
to
you
he
had
ordered
her
out
of
the
house
then
but
she
had
laughed
at
him
she
could
always
better
him
in
an
argument
suppose
i
do
go
she
had
inquired
what
are
you
going
to
live
on
not
crazy
in
the
head
if
you
she
rather
thought
he
would
strike
her
he
had
done
it
before
with
the
idea
of
enforcing
discipline
if
he
did
she
would
leave
him
let
him
shift
for
himself
he
had
taken
her
money
for
years
and
he
could
live
on
that
but
he
had
only
glared
at
her
we
would
have
done
better
to
remain
in
germany
he
said
america
has
no
respect
for
parents
it
has
no
discipline
it
is
a
country
without
she
felt
a
weakening
in
him
and
followed
up
her
advantage
and
another
thing
while
we
at
it
she
flung
at
him
do
you
go
on
trying
to
shove
rudolph
down
my
throat
i
off
rudolph
for
she
flung
out
her
arm
and
old
herman
saw
the
gleam
of
something
gold
on
her
wrist
he
caught
her
hand
in
his
iron
grip
and
shoved
up
her
sleeve
there
was
a
tiny
gold
there
on
a
flexible
chain
his
amazement
and
rage
gave
her
a
moment
to
think
although
she
was
terrified
where
did
you
get
that
the
mill
gave
them
to
the
stenographers
for
why
did
you
not
tell
me
we
not
talking
much
these
days
are
we
he
let
her
go
then
and
that
night
in
the
little
room
behind
gustav
shroeder
saloon
he
put
the
question
to
rudolph
because
he
was
excited
and
frightened
he
made
slow
work
of
his
inquiry
and
rudolph
had
a
moment
to
think
sure
he
replied
all
the
girls
in
the
executive
offices
got
but
when
the
meeting
was
over
rudolph
did
not
go
back
to
his
he
walked
the
streets
and
thought
he
had
saved
anna
from
her
father
but
he
was
of
no
mind
to
save
her
from
himself
she
would
have
to
account
to
him
for
that
watch
anna
herself
lay
awake
until
late
she
saw
already
the
difficulties
before
her
herman
was
suspicious
he
might
inquire
there
were
other
girls
from
the
mill
offices
on
the
hill
and
he
might
speak
to
rudolph
the
next
evening
she
found
rudolph
waiting
for
her
outside
the
mill
gate
together
they
started
up
what
had
been
when
herman
bought
the
cottage
a
green
hill
with
a
winding
path
but
the
smoke
and
ore
from
the
mill
had
long
ago
turned
it
to
bareness
had
killed
the
trees
and
shrubbery
and
filled
the
little
hollows
where
once
the
first
arbutus
had
hidden
with
cinders
and
ore
dust
the
path
had
become
a
crooked
street
lined
with
wooden
houses
and
paved
with
worn
and
broken
bricks
where
once
herman
klein
had
carried
his
pail
and
whistled
bits
of
shubert
as
he
climbed
along
a
long
line
of
blackened
men
made
their
evening
way
untidy
children
sat
on
the
curb
dogs
lay
in
the
center
of
the
road
and
women
in
all
stages
of
dishabille
hung
over
the
high
railings
of
their
porches
and
watched
for
their
men
under
protest
of
giving
her
a
lift
up
the
hill
rudolph
slipped
his
hand
through
anna
left
arm
immediately
she
knew
that
the
movement
was
a
pretext
she
could
not
free
herself
be
good
now
he
cautioned
her
i
got
you
i
want
to
see
that
you
let
me
i
going
to
see
that
with
his
free
hand
he
felt
under
her
sleeve
and
drew
down
the
bracelet
so
the
mill
gave
it
to
you
eh
that
a
lie
and
you
know
i
tell
you
rudolph
she
temporized
only
do
tell
father
all
the
girls
have
watches
and
i
wanted
one
so
i
bought
that
a
lie
on
the
installment
plan
she
insisted
a
dollar
a
week
straight
i
paid
five
on
it
he
was
almost
convinced
not
quite
he
unfastened
it
awkwardly
and
took
it
off
her
wrist
it
was
a
plain
little
octagonal
watch
and
on
the
back
was
a
monogram
the
monogram
made
him
suspicious
again
it
only
gold
filled
pretty
classy
monogram
for
a
cheap
he
held
it
close
on
the
dial
was
the
jeweler
name
a
famous
one
he
said
nothing
more
put
it
back
on
anna
arm
and
released
her
at
the
next
corner
he
left
her
with
a
civil
enough
but
with
rage
in
his
heart
chapter
xvii
the
destined
to
be
so
crucial
came
in
cheerfully
enough
there
was
to
be
sure
a
trifle
less
ostentation
in
the
public
celebrations
but
the
usual
amount
of
champagne
brought
in
the
most
vital
year
in
the
history
of
the
nation
the
customary
number
of
men
warmed
by
that
champagne
made
reckless
love
to
the
women
who
happened
to
be
near
them
and
forgot
it
by
morning
and
the
women
themselves
presented
pictures
of
splendor
of
a
peculiar
gorgeousness
the
fact
that
almost
coincident
with
the
war
there
had
come
into
prominence
an
entirely
new
school
of
color
formed
one
of
the
curious
contrasts
of
the
period
into
a
drab
world
there
flamed
strange
and
bizarre
theatrical
effects
in
scenery
and
costume
some
of
it
was
beautiful
most
of
it
merely
fantastic
but
it
was
immediately
reflected
in
the
clothing
of
fashionable
women
europe
which
had
originated
it
could
use
it
but
little
but
great
opulent
america
adopted
it
and
made
it
her
own
so
while
the
rest
of
the
world
was
gray
america
flamed
and
natalie
spencer
spending
her
days
between
dressmakers
and
decorators
flamed
with
the
rest
on
eve
clayton
spencer
always
preceded
the
annual
ball
of
the
city
club
of
which
he
was
president
by
a
dinner
to
the
board
of
governors
and
their
wives
it
was
his
dinner
he
and
not
natalie
arranged
the
seating
ordered
the
flowers
and
planned
the
menu
he
took
considerable
pride
in
it
he
liked
to
think
that
it
was
both
beautiful
and
dignified
his
father
had
been
president
before
him
and
he
liked
to
think
that
he
was
carrying
on
his
father
custom
with
the
punctilious
dignity
that
had
so
characterized
him
he
was
dressed
early
natalie
had
been
closeted
with
madeleine
her
maid
and
a
for
hours
as
he
went
he
could
hear
her
voice
raised
in
querulous
protest
about
something
when
he
went
into
the
library
buckham
was
there
stooping
over
the
fire
his
austere
old
face
serious
and
intent
well
another
year
almost
gone
buckham
he
said
yes
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
what
the
i
hope
it
will
bring
you
peace
and
happiness
thank
and
after
buckham
had
gone
he
thought
that
rather
a
curious
wish
peace
and
happiness
well
god
knows
he
wanted
both
a
vague
comprehension
of
the
understanding
the
upper
servants
of
a
household
acquire
as
to
the
inner
life
of
the
family
stirred
in
him
how
much
they
knew
and
concealed
under
their
impassive
service
when
natalie
came
down
the
staircase
a
few
minutes
later
she
was
swathed
in
her
chinchilla
evening
wrap
and
she
watched
his
face
after
her
custom
when
she
expected
to
annoy
him
with
the
furtive
look
that
he
had
grown
to
associate
with
some
unpleasantness
i
hate
dressing
for
a
ball
at
this
hour
she
said
rather
breathlessly
i
do
feel
by
madeleine
in
street
costume
was
behind
her
with
a
great
box
she
has
something
for
my
hair
she
explained
her
tone
was
nervous
but
he
was
entirely
unsuspicious
you
do
mind
if
i
do
go
on
to
page
do
you
i
rather
tired
and
i
ought
to
stay
at
the
club
as
late
as
i
of
course
not
i
shall
probably
pick
up
some
people
anyhow
everybody
is
going
in
the
car
she
chattered
feverishly
and
he
listened
lapsing
into
one
of
the
silences
which
her
talkative
spells
always
enforced
what
flowers
are
you
having
she
asked
finally
white
lilacs
and
did
your
orchids
come
thanks
yes
but
i
not
wearing
them
my
gown
is
flame
color
they
simply
flame
color
a
sort
of
orange
she
explained
and
in
a
slightly
defiant
tone
rodney
is
a
costume
dance
you
do
you
mean
you
are
in
fancy
dress
i
am
he
was
rather
startled
the
annual
dinner
of
the
board
of
governors
of
the
city
club
and
their
wives
was
a
most
dignified
function
always
he
was
the
youngest
by
far
of
the
men
the
women
were
all
frankly
dowagers
they
represented
the
conservative
element
of
the
city
social
life
that
element
which
frowned
on
smartness
and
did
not
even
recognize
the
bizarre
it
was
secure
in
its
position
influential
and
slightly
tedious
there
will
be
plenty
in
fancy
not
at
the
stodgy
old
frumps
was
natalie
comment
i
believe
you
would
rather
break
one
of
the
ten
commandments
than
one
of
the
conventions
she
added
it
was
when
he
saw
her
coming
down
the
staircase
in
the
still
empty
clubhouse
that
he
realized
the
reason
for
her
defiant
attitude
when
she
acknowledged
to
fancy
dress
for
she
wore
a
peacock
costume
of
the
most
daring
sort
over
an
orange
foundation
eccentric
in
itself
and
very
short
was
a
vivid
tunic
covered
with
peacock
feathers
on
gold
tissue
with
a
sweeping
tail
behind
and
on
her
head
was
the
towering
chest
of
a
peacock
on
a
gold
bandeau
she
waved
a
great
peacock
fan
also
and
down
the
stairs
she
paused
and
looked
down
at
him
with
eyes
do
you
like
it
it
is
very
wonderful
he
said
gravely
he
could
not
hurt
her
her
pleasure
in
it
was
too
naive
it
dawned
on
him
then
that
natalie
was
really
a
child
a
spoiled
and
wilful
child
and
always
afterward
he
tried
to
remember
that
and
to
judge
her
accordingly
she
came
down
the
upturned
wired
points
of
the
tunic
trembling
as
she
stepped
when
she
came
closer
he
saw
that
she
was
made
up
for
the
costume
ball
also
her
face
frankly
rouged
fine
lines
under
her
eyes
her
lashes
blackened
she
looked
very
lovely
and
quite
unfamiliar
but
he
had
determined
not
to
spoil
her
evening
and
he
continued
gravely
smiling
you
better
like
it
clay
she
said
and
took
a
calculating
advantage
of
what
she
considered
a
softened
mood
it
cost
a
thousand
she
went
on
past
him
toward
the
room
where
the
florist
was
still
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
the
flowers
on
the
table
when
the
first
guests
arrived
she
came
back
and
took
her
place
near
him
and
he
was
uncomfortably
aware
of
the
little
start
of
surprise
with
which
she
burst
upon
each
new
arrival
in
the
old
and
rather
staid
surroundings
of
the
club
she
looked
out
of
place
oriental
extravagant
absurd
and
clayton
spencer
suffered
to
draw
him
as
he
stood
in
the
club
that
last
year
of
our
peace
is
to
draw
him
not
only
with
his
virtues
but
with
his
faults
his
over
emphasis
on
small
things
his
jealousy
for
his
dignity
his
hatred
of
the
conspicuous
and
the
unusual
when
after
the
informal
manner
of
clubs
the
party
went
in
to
dinner
he
was
having
one
of
the
bad
hours
of
his
life
to
that
time
and
when
as
was
inevitable
the
talk
of
the
rather
serious
table
turned
to
the
war
it
seemed
to
him
that
natalie
gorgeous
and
painted
represented
the
very
worst
of
the
country
he
loved
indifference
extravagance
and
ostentatious
display
but
natalie
was
not
america
thank
god
natalie
was
not
america
already
with
the
men
she
was
having
a
triumph
the
women
soberly
clad
glanced
at
each
other
with
raised
and
cynical
smiles
above
the
band
already
playing
in
the
ballroom
clayton
could
hear
old
terry
mackenzie
paying
natalie
extravagant
flagrant
compliments
you
should
be
sitting
in
the
sun
or
on
a
balcony
he
was
saying
his
eyes
twinkling
and
pretty
gentlemen
with
long
curls
and
their
hats
tucked
under
their
arms
should
be
feeding
you
nightingale
tongues
or
whatever
it
is
you
bugs
said
natalie
but
tell
me
terry
bent
toward
her
and
terry
kept
fascinated
eyes
on
him
tell
me
lovely
creature
are
peacocks
unlucky
are
they
what
bad
luck
can
happen
to
me
because
i
dress
like
this
frightfully
bad
luck
said
terry
jovially
some
one
will
undoubtedly
carry
you
away
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
go
madly
through
the
world
hunting
a
marble
balustrade
to
set
you
on
i
do
it
myself
if
you
give
me
any
perhaps
had
clayton
spencer
been
entirely
honest
with
himself
that
night
he
would
have
acknowledged
that
he
had
had
a
vague
hope
of
seeing
audrey
at
the
club
cars
came
up
discharged
their
muffled
occupants
under
the
awning
and
drove
away
again
delight
and
haverford
arrived
and
he
danced
with
delight
to
her
great
anxiety
lest
she
might
not
dance
well
graham
came
very
late
in
the
wake
of
marion
hayden
but
audrey
did
not
appear
he
waited
until
the
came
in
the
cotillion
was
on
then
and
the
favors
for
the
midnight
figure
were
gilt
cornucopias
filled
with
loose
flowers
the
lights
went
out
for
a
moment
on
the
hour
the
twelve
strokes
were
rung
on
a
triangle
in
the
orchestra
and
there
was
a
moment
quiet
then
the
light
blazed
again
flowers
and
confetti
were
thrown
and
club
servants
in
livery
carried
round
trays
of
champagne
clayton
standing
glass
in
hand
surveyed
the
scene
with
a
mixture
of
satisfaction
and
impatience
he
found
terry
mackenzie
at
his
elbow
great
party
clay
he
said
well
here
to
and
may
it
bring
may
it
bring
peace
said
clayton
and
raised
his
glass
some
time
later
going
home
in
the
car
with
mackenzie
quiet
and
slightly
grim
beside
him
terry
spoke
out
of
a
thoughtful
silence
there
something
wrong
with
clay
he
said
if
ever
a
fellow
had
a
right
to
be
happy
he
has
a
queer
look
have
you
noticed
it
anybody
married
to
natalie
spencer
would
develop
what
you
call
a
queer
look
she
replied
tartly
do
you
think
he
is
in
love
with
her
if
you
ask
me
i
think
he
has
reached
the
point
where
he
ca
bear
the
sight
of
her
but
he
does
know
she
so
is
a
replied
terry
acidly
or
a
kitten
or
a
fancy
but
you
would
care
to
be
married
to
them
would
you
it
was
almost
dawn
when
natalie
came
in
clayton
had
not
been
asleep
he
had
got
to
thinking
rather
feverishly
of
the
without
in
any
way
making
a
resolution
he
had
determined
to
make
it
a
better
year
than
the
last
to
be
more
gentle
with
natalie
more
understanding
with
graham
to
use
his
new
prosperity
wisely
to
forget
his
own
lack
of
happiness
in
making
others
happy
he
was
very
vague
about
that
the
search
of
the
ages
the
rector
had
called
happiness
and
one
found
it
by
giving
it
to
his
surprise
natalie
came
into
his
bedroom
looking
like
some
queer
oriental
bird
vivid
and
strangely
unlike
herself
i
saw
your
light
heavens
what
a
party
i
glad
you
enjoyed
it
i
hope
you
did
mind
my
not
going
i
wish
you
had
clay
you
never
guess
what
probably
not
what
well
audrey
just
made
it
that
all
funny
i
wish
you
seen
some
of
their
faces
of
course
she
was
disgraceful
but
she
took
it
off
right
away
but
it
was
like
her
no
one
else
would
have
his
mouth
felt
dry
audrey
disgraceful
it
was
in
the
stable
you
know
i
told
you
and
just
at
midnight
the
doors
opened
and
a
big
white
horse
leaped
in
with
audrey
on
his
back
no
saddle
nothing
she
was
dressed
like
a
rider
in
the
circus
short
tulle
skirts
and
tights
they
nearly
mobbed
her
with
she
yawned
well
i
off
to
he
roused
himself
a
happy
my
thanks
she
said
and
wandered
out
her
absurd
feathered
tail
trailing
behind
her
he
lay
back
and
closed
his
eyes
so
audrey
had
done
that
audrey
who
had
been
in
his
mind
all
those
sleepless
hours
for
he
knew
now
that
back
of
all
his
resolutions
to
do
better
had
been
the
thought
of
her
he
felt
disappointed
and
bitter
the
sad
disillusion
of
the
middle
years
still
heroically
clinging
to
faiths
that
one
after
another
destroyed
themselves
was
his
chapter
xviii
audrey
was
frightened
she
did
not
care
a
penny
worth
what
her
little
world
thought
indeed
she
knew
that
she
had
given
it
a
new
thrill
and
so
had
won
its
enthusiastic
approval
she
was
afraid
of
what
clayton
would
think
she
was
absurdly
quiet
and
virtuous
all
the
next
day
gathered
out
her
stockings
and
mended
them
began
a
personal
expenditure
account
for
the
heading
it
carefully
with
darning
silk
cents
wrote
a
long
letter
to
chris
and
listened
for
the
telephone
if
only
he
would
call
her
so
she
could
explain
still
what
could
she
explain
she
had
done
it
it
was
water
over
the
dam
and
it
is
no
fault
of
audrey
that
she
would
probably
have
spelled
it
by
noon
she
was
fairly
abject
she
did
not
analyze
her
own
anxiety
or
why
the
recollection
of
her
escapade
which
would
a
short
time
before
have
filled
her
with
a
sort
of
unholy
joy
now
turned
her
sick
and
trembling
then
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
clay
called
her
up
she
gasped
a
little
when
she
heard
his
voice
i
wanted
to
tell
you
audrey
he
said
that
we
can
probably
use
the
girl
you
spoke
about
rather
very
well
thank
you
is
was
there
something
else
too
something
else
you
are
angry
are
you
he
hesitated
surprised
not
angry
i
have
any
possible
right
to
be
will
you
come
up
and
let
me
tell
you
about
it
clay
i
do
see
how
that
will
help
it
will
help
he
laughed
at
that
her
new
humility
was
so
unlike
her
why
of
course
i
come
audrey
he
said
and
as
he
rang
off
he
was
happier
than
he
had
been
all
day
he
was
coming
audrey
moved
around
the
little
room
adjusting
chairs
rearranging
the
flowers
that
had
poured
in
on
day
brushing
the
hearth
and
as
she
worked
she
whistled
he
would
be
getting
into
the
car
now
he
would
be
so
far
on
his
way
he
would
be
almost
there
she
ran
into
her
bedroom
and
powdered
her
nose
with
her
lips
puckered
still
whistling
and
her
heart
singing
but
he
scolded
her
thoroughly
at
first
why
on
earth
did
you
do
it
he
finished
i
still
ca
understand
i
see
you
one
day
gravity
itself
a
serious
young
woman
as
you
are
and
then
i
hear
it
is
like
you
oh
yes
it
is
it
exactly
like
me
like
one
me
there
are
others
of
she
told
him
then
making
pitiful
confession
of
her
own
pride
and
her
anxiety
to
spare
chris
name
i
could
bear
to
have
them
suspect
he
had
gone
to
the
war
because
of
a
girl
whatever
he
ran
away
from
clay
he
doing
all
right
he
listened
gravely
with
toward
the
end
a
jealousy
he
would
not
have
acknowledged
even
to
himself
was
it
possible
that
she
still
loved
chris
might
she
not
after
the
fashion
of
women
be
building
a
new
and
idealized
chris
now
that
he
had
gone
to
war
out
of
his
very
common
clay
he
has
done
splendidly
he
agreed
again
the
warmth
and
coziness
of
the
little
room
enveloped
him
low
huskily
sweet
voice
her
quick
smile
her
new
and
unaccustomed
humility
and
the
odd
sense
of
her
understanding
comforted
him
she
made
her
indefinite
appeal
to
the
best
that
was
in
him
nothing
so
ennobles
a
man
as
to
have
some
woman
believe
in
his
nobility
clay
she
said
suddenly
you
are
worrying
about
nothing
that
wo
straighten
out
in
would
it
help
to
talk
about
it
he
realized
that
he
had
really
come
to
her
to
talk
about
it
it
had
been
in
the
back
of
his
head
all
the
time
i
rather
anxious
about
toots
hayden
i
afraid
she
got
him
clay
there
is
a
trick
in
the
game
she
does
know
he
had
about
as
much
chance
as
i
have
of
being
twenty
again
she
wants
to
make
a
wealthy
marriage
and
she
picked
on
graham
that
it
is
only
marion
i
afraid
there
another
girl
a
girl
at
the
mill
his
stenographer
i
have
no
proof
of
anything
in
fact
i
think
there
is
anything
yet
she
in
love
with
him
probably
or
she
thinks
she
is
i
happened
on
them
together
and
she
looked
of
course
if
what
you
say
about
marion
is
true
he
can
not
care
for
her
even
well
in
any
oh
nonsense
clay
a
man
especially
a
boy
can
love
a
girls
he
can
be
crazy
about
any
girl
he
is
with
it
may
not
be
love
but
it
plays
the
same
tricks
with
him
that
the
real
thing
i
ca
believe
no
you
she
leaned
back
and
watched
him
how
much
of
a
boy
he
was
himself
anyhow
and
yet
how
little
he
understood
the
complicated
problems
of
a
boy
like
graham
irresponsible
but
responsive
rich
without
labor
with
time
for
the
sort
of
dalliance
clay
himself
at
the
same
age
had
had
neither
leisure
nor
inclination
to
indulge
he
was
wandering
about
the
room
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
head
bent
when
he
stopped
what
am
i
to
do
with
the
girl
audrey
get
rid
of
her
that
not
so
easy
as
it
he
told
her
of
dunbar
and
the
photographs
of
rudolph
klein
and
the
problem
as
he
saw
it
so
there
i
am
he
finished
if
i
let
her
go
i
lose
one
of
the
links
in
dunbar
chain
if
i
keep
her
ca
natalie
talk
to
him
sometimes
a
woman
can
get
to
the
bottom
of
these
things
when
a
man
ca
he
might
tell
her
all
about
possibly
but
i
think
it
unlikely
natalie
would
tell
she
leaned
over
and
patted
his
hand
impulsively
what
devils
we
women
are
she
said
now
and
then
one
of
us
gets
what
she
deserves
that
me
and
now
and
then
one
of
us
get
something
she
does
deserve
and
that
natalie
she
to
he
is
all
she
she
has
something
in
her
voice
made
him
turn
and
look
at
her
that
ought
to
be
something
you
know
she
added
and
laughed
a
little
does
natalie
pay
his
debts
i
rather
think
but
that
was
a
subject
he
could
not
go
on
with
the
fault
is
mine
i
know
my
business
better
than
i
know
how
to
handle
my
life
or
my
family
i
do
know
why
i
trouble
you
with
it
all
anyhow
you
have
he
hesitated
that
not
exactly
true
either
i
do
know
i
relying
on
your
woman
wit
to
help
me
i
wrong
about
graham
i
have
a
curious
feeling
that
i
am
losing
him
i
ca
ask
for
his
confidence
i
ca
apparently
even
deserve
it
i
see
him
day
after
day
with
all
the
good
stuff
there
is
in
him
working
as
little
as
he
can
drinking
more
than
he
should
out
half
the
night
running
into
debt
good
heavens
audrey
what
can
i
do
she
hesitated
of
course
you
know
one
thing
that
would
save
him
clay
what
our
getting
into
the
i
ought
not
to
have
to
lose
my
boy
in
order
to
find
him
but
we
are
going
to
be
in
he
had
risen
and
was
standing
an
elbow
on
the
looking
down
at
her
i
suppose
every
man
wonders
once
in
a
while
how
he
conduct
himself
in
a
crisis
when
the
lusitania
went
down
i
dare
say
a
good
many
fellows
wondered
if
they
have
been
able
to
keep
their
coward
bodies
out
of
the
boats
i
know
i
did
and
i
wonder
about
myself
now
what
can
i
do
if
we
go
into
the
war
i
could
do
a
forced
march
of
more
than
five
miles
i
ca
drill
or
whatever
they
call
it
i
can
shoot
clay
pigeons
but
i
do
believe
i
could
hit
a
german
coming
at
me
with
a
bayonet
at
twenty
feet
i
be
pretty
much
of
a
total
loss
yet
i
want
to
do
and
when
she
sat
very
silent
looking
into
the
fire
you
see
you
think
it
absurd
hardly
absurd
she
roused
herself
to
look
up
at
him
if
it
is
the
sort
of
splendid
absurdity
i
am
proud
of
i
was
wondering
what
natalie
would
i
do
believe
it
lies
between
a
man
and
his
wife
it
between
him
and
his
he
was
rather
ashamed
of
that
however
and
soon
after
he
went
away
chapter
xix
natalie
spencer
was
finding
life
full
of
interest
that
winter
now
and
then
she
read
the
headings
in
the
newspapers
not
because
she
was
really
interested
but
that
she
might
say
at
the
which
was
to
her
the
proper
end
of
a
perfect
day
what
do
you
think
of
turkey
declaring
her
independence
or
i
see
we
have
taken
the
etoile
clayton
had
overheard
her
more
than
once
and
had
marveled
at
the
dexterity
with
which
these
leaders
thrown
out
she
was
able
to
avoid
committing
herself
further
the
new
house
engrossed
her
she
was
seeing
a
great
deal
of
rodney
too
and
now
and
then
she
had
fancied
that
there
was
a
different
tone
in
rodney
voice
when
he
addressed
her
she
never
analyzed
that
tone
or
what
it
suggested
but
it
gave
her
a
new
interest
in
life
she
was
always
marceled
massaged
freshly
manicured
and
she
had
found
a
new
facial
treatment
clayton
in
his
room
at
night
could
hear
the
sharp
slapping
of
flesh
on
flesh
as
madeleine
gently
pounded
certain
expensive
creams
into
the
skin
of
her
face
and
neck
she
refused
all
forms
of
war
activity
although
now
and
then
she
put
some
appeal
before
clayton
and
asked
him
if
he
cared
to
send
a
check
he
never
suggested
that
she
answer
any
of
these
demands
personally
after
an
experience
early
in
the
winter
why
do
you
send
it
yourself
he
had
asked
would
you
like
it
to
go
in
your
name
it
does
matter
i
do
know
any
of
the
he
had
tried
to
explain
what
he
meant
you
might
like
to
feel
that
you
are
doing
i
thought
my
allowance
was
only
to
dress
on
if
i
to
attend
to
charities
too
you
have
to
increase
but
he
argued
patiently
if
you
only
sent
them
dollars
did
without
some
little
thing
to
do
it
you
feel
rather
more
as
though
you
were
giving
would
you
dollars
and
be
laughed
at
he
had
given
in
then
if
i
put
an
extra
thousand
dollars
to
your
account
will
you
check
it
out
to
this
fund
it
too
will
you
yes
of
course
she
had
agreed
indifferently
and
he
had
notified
her
that
the
money
was
in
the
bank
but
two
months
later
the
list
of
contributors
was
published
and
neither
his
name
nor
natalie
was
among
them
toward
personal
service
she
had
no
inclination
whatever
she
would
promise
anything
but
the
hour
of
fulfilling
always
found
her
with
something
else
to
do
yet
she
had
kindly
impulses
at
times
when
something
occurred
to
take
her
mind
from
herself
she
gave
liberally
to
street
mendicants
she
sent
her
car
to
be
used
by
those
of
her
friends
who
had
none
she
was
lavish
with
flowers
to
the
sick
although
clayton
paid
her
florist
bills
she
was
lavish
with
money
but
never
with
herself
in
the
weeks
after
the
opening
of
the
new
year
clayton
found
himself
watching
her
he
wondered
sometimes
just
what
went
on
in
her
mind
during
the
hours
when
she
sat
her
hands
folded
gazing
into
space
he
could
not
tell
he
surmised
her
planning
always
planning
the
new
house
a
gown
a
hat
a
party
but
late
in
january
he
began
to
think
that
she
was
planning
something
else
old
terry
mackenzie
had
been
there
one
night
and
he
had
asserted
not
only
that
war
was
coming
but
that
we
would
be
driven
to
conscription
to
raise
an
army
they
all
had
to
come
to
it
he
insisted
and
we
will
as
sure
as
god
made
little
fishes
you
ca
raise
a
million
volunteers
for
a
war
that
three
thousand
miles
you
mean
conscription
among
the
laboring
class
natalie
had
asked
naively
and
there
had
been
a
roar
of
laughter
not
at
all
terry
had
said
and
chuckled
this
war
if
it
comes
is
every
man
burden
rich
and
poor
only
the
rich
will
give
most
because
they
have
most
to
i
think
that
ridiculous
natalie
had
said
it
was
after
that
that
clayton
began
to
wonder
what
she
was
planning
he
came
home
late
one
afternoon
to
find
that
they
were
spending
the
evening
in
and
to
find
a
very
serious
natalie
waiting
when
he
came
dressed
for
dinner
she
made
an
effort
to
be
conversational
but
it
was
a
failure
he
was
uneasily
aware
that
she
was
watching
him
inspecting
calculating
choosing
her
moment
but
it
was
not
until
they
were
having
coffee
that
she
spoke
i
uneasy
about
graham
he
looked
up
quickly
yes
i
think
he
ought
to
go
away
he
ought
to
stay
here
and
make
a
man
of
himself
he
came
out
almost
in
spite
of
himself
he
knew
well
enough
that
such
a
note
always
roused
natalie
antagonism
and
he
waited
for
the
storm
but
none
came
he
not
doing
very
well
is
he
he
not
failing
entirely
but
he
gives
the
best
of
himself
outside
the
mill
that
she
puzzled
him
had
she
heard
of
marion
do
you
think
if
he
was
away
from
this
silly
crowd
he
plays
with
as
he
calls
it
that
he
would
be
better
off
where
for
instance
you
keep
an
agent
in
england
he
could
go
there
or
to
russia
if
the
russian
contract
goes
he
was
still
puzzled
but
why
england
or
russia
anywhere
out
of
this
he
does
have
to
leave
this
country
to
get
away
from
a
designing
from
her
astonished
expression
he
knew
that
he
had
been
wrong
she
was
not
trying
to
get
him
away
from
marion
from
what
she
bent
forward
her
face
set
hard
what
woman
well
it
was
out
she
might
as
well
know
it
do
you
think
it
possible
natalie
that
he
may
intend
to
marry
marion
hayden
there
was
a
very
unpleasant
after
that
marion
was
a
parasite
of
the
rich
she
had
abused
natalie
hospitality
she
was
designing
she
played
bridge
for
her
dress
money
she
had
ensnared
the
boy
and
then
that
settles
it
i
should
think
he
ought
to
leave
america
if
you
have
a
single
thought
for
his
welfare
you
send
him
to
then
you
had
known
about
marion
when
you
proposed
that
before
no
i
knew
he
was
not
doing
well
and
i
anxious
after
all
he
my
boy
he
is
i
know
he
supplemented
gravely
he
is
all
you
have
but
i
still
do
understand
why
he
must
leave
it
was
not
until
she
had
gone
to
her
room
leaving
him
uneasily
pacing
the
library
floor
that
he
found
the
solution
old
terry
mackenzie
and
his
statement
about
conscription
natalie
wanted
graham
sent
out
of
the
country
so
he
would
be
safe
she
would
purchase
for
hint
a
shameful
immunity
if
war
came
she
would
stultify
the
boy
to
keep
him
safe
in
that
hour
of
clear
vision
he
saw
how
she
had
always
stultified
the
boy
to
keep
him
safe
he
saw
her
life
a
series
of
small
subterfuges
of
petty
indulgences
of
little
plots
against
himself
all
directed
toward
securing
graham
immunity
from
trouble
at
school
from
debt
from
his
own
authority
a
wave
of
unreasoning
anger
surged
over
him
but
with
it
there
was
pity
too
pity
for
the
narrowness
of
her
life
and
her
mind
pity
for
her
very
selfishness
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
a
shamefaced
pity
for
himself
he
shook
himself
violently
when
a
man
got
sorry
for
himself

rudolph
klein
had
not
for
a
moment
believed
anna
story
about
the
watch
and
on
the
day
after
he
discovered
it
on
her
wrist
he
verified
his
suspicions
during
his
noon
hour
he
went
and
with
the
confident
swagger
of
a
certain
type
of
man
who
feels
himself
out
of
place
entered
the
jeweler
shop
in
question
he
had
to
wait
for
some
little
time
and
he
spent
it
in
surveying
contemptuously
the
contents
of
the
that
even
his
wildest
estimate
fell
far
short
of
their
value
he
did
not
suspect
but
his
lips
curled
this
was
where
the
money
earned
by
honest
workmen
was
spent
that
women
might
gleam
with
such
gewgaws
wall
street
bought
them
wall
street
which
was
forcing
this
country
into
the
war
to
protect
its
loans
to
the
allies
america
was
to
pull
england
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire
that
women
and
yet
more
women
might
wear
those
strings
of
pearls
those
glittering
diamond
baubles
into
his
crooked
mind
there
flashed
a
line
from
a
speech
at
the
third
street
hall
the
night
before
war
is
hell
let
those
who
want
to
go
to
so
wall
street
bought
pearls
for
its
women
and
the
dissolute
sons
of
the
rich
bought
gold
for
girls
they
wanted
to
seduce
the
expression
on
his
face
was
so
terrible
that
the
clerk
behind
the
counter
waiting
to
find
what
he
wanted
was
startled
i
want
to
look
at
gold
he
said
and
eyed
the
clerk
for
a
trace
of
patronage
ladies
he
finally
found
one
that
was
a
duplicate
of
anna
and
examined
it
carefully
yes
it
was
the
same
the
maker
name
on
the
dial
the
space
for
the
monogram
on
the
back
everything
how
much
is
this
one
one
hundred
he
almost
dropped
it
a
hundred
dollars
then
he
remembered
story
have
you
any
ones
that
look
like
this
we
do
not
handle
he
put
it
down
and
turned
to
go
then
he
stopped
do
sell
on
the
installment
plan
either
i
suppose
the
sneer
in
his
voice
was
clearer
than
his
anxiety
in
his
mind
he
already
knew
the
answer
sorry
he
went
out
so
he
had
been
right
that
young
skunk
had
paid
a
hundred
dollars
for
a
watch
for
anna
to
rudolph
it
meant
but
one
thing
that
had
been
early
in
january
for
some
days
he
kept
his
own
counsel
thinking
planning
watching
he
was
jealous
of
graham
but
with
a
calculating
jealousy
that
set
him
wondering
how
to
turn
his
knowledge
to
his
own
advantage
and
anna
lack
of
liberty
comforted
him
somewhat
he
could
meet
her
outside
the
mill
at
least
not
without
his
knowing
it
he
established
a
system
of
espionage
over
her
that
drove
her
almost
to
madness
what
you
hanging
round
for
she
would
demand
when
he
stepped
forward
at
the
mill
gate
suppose
i
never
want
to
be
by
myself
or
you
just
go
away
rudolph
klein
i
going
up
with
some
of
the
but
she
never
lost
him
he
was
beside
her
or
at
her
heels
his
small
crafty
eyes
on
her
when
he
walked
behind
her
there
was
a
sensuous
gleam
in
them
after
a
few
weeks
she
became
terrified
there
was
a
coldness
of
deviltry
in
him
she
knew
and
he
had
the
she
was
certain
he
knew
about
the
watch
and
her
impertinence
masked
an
agony
of
fear
suppose
he
went
to
her
father
why
if
he
knew
did
he
go
to
her
father
she
suspected
him
but
she
did
not
know
of
what
she
knew
he
was
an
enemy
of
all
government
save
that
of
the
mob
that
he
was
an
incendiary
a
firebrand
who
set
on
fire
the
brutish
passions
of
a
certain
type
of
malcontents
she
knew
for
all
he
pretended
to
be
the
voice
of
labor
he
no
more
represented
the
honest
labor
of
the
country
than
he
represented
law
and
order
she
watched
him
sometimes
at
the
table
when
on
sundays
he
ate
the
meal
with
them
his
thin
hatchet
face
his
prominent
epiglottis
he
wore
a
fresh
cotton
shirt
then
with
a
flaming
necktie
but
he
did
not
clean
his
fingernails
and
his
talk
was
always
of
tearing
down
never
of
building
up
just
give
us
time
and
we
show
them
he
often
said
and
them
was
always
the
men
higher
up
he
hated
policemen
he
and
herman
had
had
many
arguments
about
policemen
herman
was
not
like
rudolph
he
believed
in
law
and
order
he
even
believed
in
those
higher
up
but
he
believed
very
strongly
in
the
fraternity
of
labor
until
the
first
weeks
of
that
herman
klein
outside
the
tyranny
of
his
home
life
represented
very
fairly
a
certain
type
of
workman
believing
in
the
dignity
and
integrity
of
his
order
but
with
his
failure
to
relocate
himself
something
went
wrong
in
herman
he
developed
in
his
obstinate
stubborn
german
head
a
suspicion
of
the
land
of
his
adoption
he
had
never
troubled
to
understand
it
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
as
he
took
for
granted
that
anna
should
work
and
turn
over
her
money
to
him
now
it
began
to
ask
things
of
him
not
much
a
delegation
of
women
came
around
one
night
and
asked
him
for
money
for
belgian
relief
the
delegation
came
because
no
one
woman
would
venture
alone
i
have
no
money
for
belgians
he
said
he
would
not
let
them
come
in
why
should
i
help
the
belgians
liars
and
hypocrites
the
story
went
about
the
neighborhood
and
he
knew
it
he
cared
nothing
for
popularity
but
he
resented
losing
his
standing
in
the
community
and
all
along
he
was
convinced
that
he
was
right
that
the
belgians
had
lied
there
had
been
in
the
germany
he
had
left
no
such
will
to
wanton
killing
these
people
were
ignorant
out
of
the
depths
of
their
ignorance
they
talked
he
read
only
german
newspapers
in
the
little
room
back
of
gustav
shroeder
he
met
only
germans
and
always
at
his
elbow
there
was
rudolph
until
the
middle
of
january
rudolph
had
not
been
able
to
get
him
to
one
of
his
incendiary
meetings
then
one
cold
night
while
anna
sewed
by
the
lamp
inside
the
little
house
rudolph
and
herman
walked
in
the
frozen
garden
herman
with
his
pipe
rudolph
with
the
cheap
cigarets
he
used
incessantly
anna
opened
the
door
a
crack
and
listened
at
first
she
was
watchful
of
rudolph
always
those
days
but
the
subject
was
not
anna
you
think
we
get
in
then
herman
asked
but
for
what
so
can
make
more
money
out
of
it
said
rudolph
bitterly
and
others
like
them
but
they
and
their
kind
do
do
the
dying
the
workers
that
go
and
die
look
at
germany
yes
it
is
so
in
all
this
talk
about
democracy
that
bunk
just
plain
bunk
why
should
the
workers
in
this
country
kill
the
workers
in
another
why
to
make
money
for
capital
more
ja
herman
assented
that
is
what
war
is
always
the
same
i
came
here
to
get
away
from
well
you
did
get
far
enough
you
left
a
king
behind
but
we
got
a
czar
herman
was
slowly
methodically
following
an
earlier
train
of
thought
i
am
a
workman
he
said
i
would
not
fight
against
other
workmen
just
as
i
a
german
will
not
fight
against
other
but
you
would
sit
here
on
the
hill
and
do
what
can
i
do
one
man
and
with
no
come
to
the
meeting
you
and
your
meetings
the
old
german
said
impatiently
you
talk
that
rudolph
lowered
his
voice
you
think
we
only
talk
eh
well
you
come
and
hear
some
things
talk
you
come
he
coaxed
changing
his
tone
and
we
have
some
beer
and
schnitzel
at
gus
after
my
treat
how
about
it
old
herman
assented
he
was
tired
of
the
house
tired
of
the
frozen
garden
tired
of
scolding
the
slovenly
girl
who
pottered
around
all
day
in
a
boudoir
cap
and
slovenly
wrapper
tired
of
anna
rebellious
face
and
pert
answers
he
went
inside
the
house
and
put
a
sweater
under
his
coat
and
got
his
cap
i
go
out
he
said
to
the
impassive
figure
under
the
lamp
you
will
stay
oh
i
do
know
i
may
take
a
you
will
stay
in
he
repeated
and
followed
rudolph
outside
there
he
reached
in
secured
the
key
and
locked
the
door
on
the
outside
anna
listening
and
white
with
anger
heard
his
ponderous
steps
going
around
to
the
back
door
and
the
click
as
he
locked
that
one
also
beast
she
muttered
german
it
was
after
midnight
when
she
heard
him
coming
back
she
prepared
to
leap
out
of
her
bed
when
he
came
to
confront
him
angrily
and
tell
him
she
was
through
she
was
leaving
home
but
long
after
she
had
miserably
cried
herself
to
sleep
herman
sat
below
his
pipe
in
his
teeth
his
stockinged
feet
spread
to
the
dying
fire
in
that
small
guarded
hail
that
night
he
had
learned
many
surprising
things
there
and
at
gus
afterward
the
fatherland
war
was
already
being
fought
in
america
and
not
only
by
germans
the
workers
of
the
world
had
banded
themselves
together
according
to
the
night
speakers
and
because
they
were
workers
they
would
not
fight
the
german
workers
it
was
all
perfectly
simple
with
the
cooperation
of
the
workers
of
the
world
which
recognized
no
country
but
a
vast
brotherhood
of
labor
it
was
possible
to
end
war
all
war
in
the
meantime
while
all
the
workers
all
over
the
world
were
being
organized
one
prevented
as
much
as
possible
any
assistance
going
to
capitalistic
england
one
did
some
simple
thing
started
a
strike
or
sawed
lumber
too
short
or
burned
a
or
put
nails
in
harvesting
machinery
or
missent
perishable
goods
or
changed
on
railroads
or
drove
copper
nails
into
so
they
died
this
was
a
pity
the
but
at
least
they
did
not
furnish
fruit
for
germany
enemies
so
each
one
did
but
one
thing
and
that
small
so
small
that
it
was
difficult
to
discover
but
there
were
two
hundred
thousand
men
to
do
them
according
to
rudolph
and
that
meant
a
great
deal
only
one
thing
about
the
meeting
herman
had
not
liked
there
were
packages
of
wicked
photographs
going
about
filthy
things
when
they
came
to
him
he
had
dropped
them
on
the
floor
what
had
they
to
do
with
germany
enemies
or
preventing
america
from
going
into
the
war
rudolph
laughed
when
he
dropped
them
they
wo
bite
you
he
had
said
and
had
stooped
to
pick
them
up
but
herman
had
kept
his
foot
on
them
so
america
would
go
into
the
war
against
the
fatherland
unless
many
hundreds
of
thousands
did
each
their
little
bit
and
if
they
did
not
america
would
go
in
and
fight
for
england
to
control
the
seas
and
the
spencer
plant
would
make
millions
of
shells
that
honest
german
workers
of
the
world
might
die
he
remembered
word
for
word
the
peroration
of
the
evening
speech
we
would
extend
the
hand
of
brotherhood
to
the
enemy
and
strangle
the
cry
for
war
in
the
fat
white
throats
of
the
of
wall
street
before
it
became
he
was
very
tired
he
stooped
and
picked
up
his
shoes
and
with
them
in
his
hand
drawn
to
his
military
erectness
he
stood
for
some
time
before
the
picture
on
the
wall
then
he
went
slowly
and
ponderously
to
bed
chapter
xxi
from
the
moment
the
day
before
christmas
when
graham
had
taken
the
little
watch
from
his
pocket
and
fastened
it
on
anna
wrist
he
was
rather
uneasily
aware
that
she
had
become
his
creature
he
had
had
no
intention
of
buying
anna
he
was
certainly
not
in
love
with
her
but
he
found
her
amusing
and
at
times
comforting
he
had
of
course
expected
to
lose
her
after
the
unlucky
day
when
clayton
had
found
them
together
but
dunbar
had
advised
that
she
be
kept
on
for
a
time
at
least
mentally
graham
figured
that
the
first
of
january
would
see
her
gone
and
the
thought
of
a
christmas
present
for
her
was
partly
compounded
of
remorse
he
had
been
buying
a
cigaret
case
for
marion
when
the
thought
came
to
him
he
had
not
bought
a
christmas
present
for
a
girl
except
flowers
since
the
first
year
he
was
at
college
he
had
sent
delight
one
that
year
a
little
books
of
poetry
what
a
precious
young
prig
he
must
have
been
he
knew
now
that
girls
only
pretended
to
care
for
books
they
wanted
jewelry
and
they
got
past
the
family
with
it
by
pretending
it
was
not
real
or
that
they
had
bought
it
out
of
their
allowances
one
of
toots
friends
was
taking
a
set
of
silver
fox
from
a
man
and
she
was
as
straight
as
a
die
oh
he
knew
girls
now
the
next
day
he
asked
anna
klein
what
would
you
like
for
christmas
anna
however
had
insisted
that
she
did
not
want
a
christmas
present
later
on
however
she
had
seen
a
watch
one
of
the
girls
on
the
hill
had
bought
for
twelve
dollars
and
on
his
further
insistence
a
day
or
so
later
she
had
said
do
you
really
want
to
know
of
course
i
you
ought
to
spend
money
on
me
you
you
let
me
attend
to
that
now
out
with
it
so
she
told
him
rather
nervously
for
she
felt
that
twelve
dollars
was
a
considerable
sum
he
had
laughed
and
agreed
instantly
but
when
he
went
to
buy
it
he
found
himself
paying
a
price
that
rather
startled
him
do
you
lose
it
young
lady
he
admonished
her
when
the
day
before
christmas
he
fastened
it
on
her
wrist
then
he
had
stooped
down
to
kiss
her
and
the
intensity
of
feeling
in
her
face
had
startled
him
a
good
watch
he
had
said
rather
uneasily
no
excuse
for
your
being
late
now
all
the
rest
of
the
day
she
was
radiant
he
meant
well
enough
even
then
he
had
never
pretended
to
love
her
he
accepted
her
adoration
petted
and
teased
her
in
return
worked
off
his
occasional
ill
humors
on
her
was
indeed
conscious
sometimes
that
he
was
behaving
extremely
well
in
keeping
things
as
they
were
but
by
the
middle
of
january
he
began
to
grow
uneasy
the
atmosphere
at
marion
was
bad
there
was
a
knowledge
of
life
plus
an
easy
toleration
of
certain
human
frailties
that
was
as
insidious
as
a
slow
fever
the
motto
of
live
and
let
live
prevailed
and
marion
refused
to
run
away
with
him
and
marry
him
or
to
let
him
go
to
his
father
in
his
office
all
day
long
there
was
anna
so
yielding
so
surely
his
to
take
if
he
wished
already
he
knew
that
things
there
must
either
end
or
go
forward
human
emotions
do
not
stand
still
they
either
advance
or
go
back
and
every
impulse
of
his
virile
young
body
was
urging
him
on
he
made
at
last
an
almost
frenzied
appeal
to
marion
to
marry
him
at
once
but
she
refused
flatly
i
not
going
to
ruin
you
she
said
if
you
ca
bring
your
people
round
we
just
have
to
they
be
all
right
once
it
is
not
if
i
know
your
father
oh
he
be
all
right
in
ten
years
or
so
but
what
about
the
next
two
or
three
we
have
to
live
would
we
he
lay
awake
most
of
the
night
thinking
things
over
did
she
really
care
for
him
as
anna
cared
for
instance
she
was
always
talking
about
their
having
to
live
if
they
could
manage
on
his
salary
for
a
while
then
it
was
because
marion
did
not
care
enough
to
try
for
the
first
time
he
began
to
question
marion
feeling
for
him
she
had
been
rather
patronizing
him
lately
he
had
overheard
her
once
speaking
of
him
as
a
nice
kid
and
it
rankled
in
sheer
assertion
of
his
manhood
he
met
anna
klein
outside
the
mill
at
the
noon
hour
the
next
day
and
took
her
for
a
little
ride
in
his
car
after
that
he
repeatedly
did
the
same
thing
choosing
infrequented
streets
and
roads
dining
with
her
sometimes
at
a
quiet
hotel
out
on
the
freeland
road
how
do
you
get
away
with
this
to
your
father
he
asked
her
once
tell
him
you
getting
ready
to
move
out
to
the
new
plant
and
working
he
not
round
much
in
the
evenings
now
he
at
meetings
or
swilling
beer
at
gus
saloon
they
a
bad
lot
graham
that
crowd
at
how
do
you
mean
bad
well
they
germans
for
one
thing
the
sort
that
shouts
about
the
fatherland
they
make
me
let
forget
them
honey
said
graham
and
reaching
under
the
caught
and
held
one
of
her
hands
he
was
beginning
to
look
at
things
with
the
twisted
vision
of
friends
he
intended
only
to
flirt
a
little
with
anna
klein
but
he
considered
that
he
was
extremely
virtuous
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
a
fool
for
letting
things
go
at
that
once
indeed
tommy
hale
happened
on
them
in
a
sitting
very
quietly
with
a
glass
of
beer
before
graham
and
a
lemonade
in
front
of
anna
and
had
winked
at
him
as
though
he
had
received
him
into
the
brotherhood
of
those
who
were
seeing
life
then
near
the
end
of
january
events
took
another
step
forward
rudolph
klein
was
discharged
from
the
mill
clayton
coming
down
one
morning
found
the
manager
hutchinson
and
dunbar
in
his
office
the
two
men
had
had
a
difference
of
opinion
and
the
matter
was
laid
before
him
he
is
a
constant
disturbing
element
hutchinson
finished
i
understand
dunbar
position
but
we
ca
afford
to
have
the
men
thrown
into
a
ferment
if
you
discharge
him
you
rouse
his
suspicions
and
those
of
his
gang
said
dunbar
sturdily
there
is
a
gang
then
a
gang
my
god
in
the
end
however
clayton
decided
to
let
rudolph
go
hutchinson
was
insistent
production
was
falling
down
one
or
two
accidents
to
the
machinery
lately
looked
like
sabotage
he
had
found
a
black
cat
crudely
drawn
on
the
cement
pavement
outside
his
that
very
morning
the
black
cat
being
the
symbol
of
those
who
advocated
destruction
what
about
the
girl
dunbar
asked
when
the
manager
had
gone
i
have
kept
her
against
my
better
judgment
for
just
a
moment
dunbar
hesitated
he
knew
certain
things
that
clayton
spencer
did
not
things
that
it
was
his
business
to
know
the
girl
might
be
valuable
one
of
these
days
she
was
in
love
with
young
spencer
the
time
might
come
when
he
dunbar
would
need
to
capitalize
that
love
and
use
it
against
rudolph
and
the
rest
of
the
crowd
that
met
in
the
little
room
behind
shroeder
saloon
it
was
too
bad
in
a
way
he
was
sorry
for
this
man
with
the
strong
repressed
face
and
kindly
mouth
who
sat
across
from
him
but
these
were
strange
times
a
man
could
not
be
too
scrupulous
better
keep
her
on
for
a
month
or
two
anyhow
he
said
they
up
to
something
and
i
miss
my
guess
if
it
is
directed
against
how
about
herman
klein
nothing
doing
stated
dunbar
flatly
our
informer
is
tending
bar
at
gus
herman
listens
and
drinks
their
beer
but
he
got
the
german
fear
of
authority
in
him
he
a
beer
socialist
that
but
in
that
dunbar
left
out
of
account
the
innate
savagery
that
lurked
under
herman
phlegmatic
surface
you
do
think
it
would
do
if
she
was
moved
to
another
office
the
point
is
dunbar
moved
his
chair
forward
the
time
may
come
when
we
will
need
the
girl
as
an
informer
rudolph
klein
is
infatuated
with
her
now
i
understand
that
she
has
a
certain
feeling
of
loyalty
to
graham
in
that
case
he
glanced
at
clayton
the
welfare
of
the
many
spencer
against
the
for
a
long
time
after
he
was
gone
clayton
sat
at
his
desk
thinking
every
instinct
in
him
revolted
against
the
situation
thus
forced
on
him
there
was
something
wrong
with
dunbar
reasoning
then
it
flashed
on
him
that
dunbar
probably
was
right
and
that
their
points
of
view
were
bitterly
opposed
dunbar
would
have
no
scruples
because
he
was
not
quite
a
gentleman
but
war
was
a
man
game
it
was
not
the
time
for
fine
distinctions
of
ethics
and
dunbar
was
certainly
a
man
if
only
he
could
talk
it
over
with
natalie
but
he
knew
natalie
too
well
to
expect
any
rational
judgment
from
her
she
would
demand
at
once
that
the
girl
should
go
yet
he
needed
a
woman
mind
on
it
in
any
question
of
relationship
between
the
sexes
men
were
creatures
of
impulse
but
women
had
plotted
and
planned
through
the
ages
they
might
lose
their
standards
but
never
their
heads
not
that
he
put
such
a
thought
into
words
he
merely
knew
that
women
were
better
at
such
things
than
men
that
afternoon
as
a
result
of
much
uncertainty
he
took
his
problem
to
audrey
and
audrey
gave
him
an
answer
you
got
to
think
of
the
mill
clay
she
said
the
dunbar
man
is
right
and
all
you
or
any
other
father
of
a
boy
can
do
is
to
pray
in
season
and
to
trust
to
graham
early
and
all
the
repressed
bitterness
in
clayton
spencer
heart
was
in
his
answer
he
never
had
any
early
training
audrey
oh
he
had
certain
things
his
manners
for
instance
but
other
things
i
ought
not
to
say
that
it
was
my
fault
too
i
not
blaming
only
natalie
only
now
when
it
is
all
we
have
to
count
on
he
was
full
of
remorse
when
he
started
for
home
he
felt
guilty
of
every
disloyalty
and
in
masculine
fashion
he
tried
to
make
up
to
natalie
for
the
truth
that
had
been
wrung
from
him
he
carried
home
a
great
bunch
of
roses
for
her
but
he
carried
home
too
a
feeling
of
comfort
and
vague
happiness
as
though
the
little
room
behind
him
still
reached
out
and
held
him
in
its
warm
embrace
chapter
xxii
in
the
evening
of
the
of
january
clayton
and
graham
were
waiting
for
natalie
to
come
down
to
dinner
when
the
bell
rang
and
dunbar
was
announced
graham
welcomed
the
interruption
he
had
been
vaguely
uneasy
with
his
father
since
that
day
in
his
office
when
clayton
had
found
him
on
anna
klein
desk
clayton
had
tried
to
restore
the
old
friendliness
of
their
relation
but
the
boy
had
only
met
his
advances
now
and
then
he
himself
made
an
overture
but
it
was
the
almost
timid
advance
of
a
puppy
that
has
been
beaten
it
left
clayton
discouraged
and
alarmed
set
him
to
going
back
over
the
past
for
any
severity
on
his
part
to
justify
it
now
and
then
he
wondered
if
in
graham
frequent
closetings
with
natalie
she
did
not
covertly
undermine
his
influence
with
the
boy
to
increase
her
own
but
if
she
did
why
what
was
going
on
behind
the
impassive
lovely
mask
that
was
her
face
dunbar
was
abrupt
as
usual
i
brought
you
some
news
spencer
he
said
he
looked
oddly
vital
and
alive
in
the
subdued
and
quiet
room
they
shown
their
hand
at
last
but
maybe
you
heard
i
heard
nothing
then
listen
said
dunbar
bending
forward
over
a
table
much
as
it
was
his
habit
to
bend
over
clayton
desk
we
in
it
at
last
or
as
good
as
in
it
unrestricted
submarine
warfare
all
bound
to
and
from
allied
ports
to
be
sunk
without
warning
we
to
be
allowed
mark
this
it
funny
we
to
be
allowed
to
send
one
ship
a
week
to
england
nicely
marked
and
carrying
passengers
there
was
a
little
pause
clayton
drew
a
long
breath
that
means
war
he
said
finally
hell
turned
over
and
stirred
up
with
a
if
we
have
any
backbone
at
all
agreed
dunbar
he
turned
to
graham
you
young
fellows
be
crazy
about
you
bet
we
will
said
graham
clayton
slipped
an
arm
about
the
boy
shoulders
he
could
not
speak
for
a
moment
all
at
once
he
saw
what
the
news
meant
he
saw
graham
going
into
the
horror
across
the
sea
he
saw
vast
lines
of
marching
men
boys
like
graham
boys
who
had
frolicked
through
their
careless
days
whistled
and
played
and
slept
sound
of
nights
now
laden
like
and
carrying
the
implements
of
death
in
their
hands
going
forward
to
something
too
terrible
to
contemplate
and
a
certain
sure
percentage
of
them
would
never
come
back
his
arm
tightened
about
the
boy
when
he
withdrew
it
graham
straightened
if
it
war
it
my
war
and
clayton
replied
quietly
it
is
your
war
old
dunbar
turned
his
back
and
inspected
natalie
portrait
when
he
faced
about
again
graham
was
lighting
a
cigaret
and
natalie
herself
was
entering
the
room
in
her
satin
she
looked
exotic
beautiful
and
dunbar
gave
her
a
fleeting
glance
of
admiration
as
he
bowed
she
looked
too
young
to
have
a
boy
going
to
war
behind
her
he
suddenly
saw
other
women
thousands
of
other
women
living
luxurious
lives
sheltered
and
pampered
and
suddenly
called
on
to
face
sacrifice
without
any
training
for
it
did
know
you
were
going
out
he
said
sorry
i
run
along
we
are
dining
at
home
said
natalie
coldly
she
remained
standing
near
the
door
as
a
hint
to
the
shabby
gentleman
with
the
alert
eyes
who
stood
by
the
table
but
dunbar
had
forgotten
her
already
i
came
here
right
away
he
explained
because
you
may
be
having
trouble
now
in
fact
i
pretty
sure
you
will
if
we
declare
war
as
we
may
war
said
natalie
and
took
a
step
forward
dunbar
remembered
her
we
will
probably
declare
war
in
a
day
or
two
the
germans
but
natalie
was
looking
at
clayton
with
a
hostility
in
her
eyes
she
took
no
trouble
to
conceal
i
hope
you
be
happy
now
you
been
talking
war
wanting
war
and
now
you
got
she
turned
and
went
out
of
the
room
the
three
men
in
the
library
below
heard
her
go
up
the
stairs
and
the
slam
of
her
door
behind
her
later
on
she
sent
word
that
she
did
not
care
for
any
dinner
and
clayton
asked
dunbar
to
remain
practical
questions
as
to
the
mill
were
discussed
graham
entering
into
them
with
a
new
interest
he
was
flushed
and
excited
but
clayton
was
rather
white
and
very
quiet
once
graham
took
advantage
of
dunbar
preoccupation
with
his
asparagus
to
say
you
do
object
to
the
aviation
service
father
wherever
you
think
you
can
be
after
coffee
graham
rose
i
go
and
speak
to
mother
he
said
and
clayton
felt
in
him
a
new
manliness
it
was
as
though
his
glance
said
she
is
a
woman
you
know
war
is
men
work
work
for
you
and
me
but
it
hard
on
afterward
clayton
was
to
remember
with
surprise
how
his
friends
gathered
that
night
at
the
house
nolan
came
in
early
his
twisted
grin
rather
accentuated
his
tall
frame
more
than
usually
stooped
he
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
library
one
hand
in
his
pocket
a
familiar
attitude
which
made
him
look
oddly
boyish
well
he
drawled
without
greeting
they
done
it
the
english
have
got
us
we
had
a
chance
the
little
welshman
come
in
clayton
said
and
talk
like
an
american
and
not
an
irishman
i
do
want
to
know
what
you
think
about
lloyd
george
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
was
thinking
nolan
observed
advancing
of
blowing
up
washington
we
have
a
fresh
start
you
see
with
washington
gone
root
and
branch
we
would
have
some
sort
of
chance
a
clear
sweep
with
the
capital
here
or
in
boston
or
clayton
laughed
behind
nolan
cynicism
he
felt
a
real
disturbance
but
dunbar
eyed
him
uncertainly
he
did
know
about
some
of
these
irish
they
fight
like
hell
of
course
if
only
they
forget
england
do
worry
about
washington
clayton
said
let
it
work
out
its
own
problems
we
will
have
our
own
what
do
you
suppose
men
like
you
and
myself
are
going
to
do
we
ca
nolan
settled
himself
in
a
long
chair
why
ca
we
fight
he
asked
i
heard
something
the
other
day
roosevelt
is
going
to
take
a
division
abroad
older
men
i
rather
like
the
idea
wherever
he
goes
there
be
fighting
i
no
rough
rider
god
knows
but
i
have
spent
a
half
hour
every
noon
in
a
gymnasium
for
the
last
ten
years
for
nothing
and
i
can
and
you
are
free
clayton
observed
quietly
nolan
looked
up
it
going
to
be
hard
on
the
women
he
said
you
all
right
they
wo
let
you
go
you
too
useful
where
you
are
but
of
course
the
when
clayton
made
no
reply
nolan
glanced
at
him
again
i
suppose
he
want
to
go
he
suggested
clayton
face
was
set
for
more
than
an
hour
now
graham
had
been
closeted
with
his
mother
and
as
the
time
went
on
and
no
slam
of
a
door
told
of
his
customary
method
of
leaving
a
room
he
had
been
conscious
of
a
growing
uneasiness
the
boy
was
soft
the
fiber
in
him
had
not
been
hardened
yet
not
enough
to
be
proof
against
tears
he
wanted
desperately
to
leave
nolan
to
go
up
and
learn
what
arguments
what
coaxing
and
selfish
whimperings
natalie
was
using
with
the
boy
but
he
wanted
also
desperately
to
have
the
boy
fight
his
own
fight
and
win
he
will
want
to
go
i
think
of
course
his
mother
will
be
shaken
just
now
it
all
new
to
her
she
would
believe
it
was
he
go
nolan
said
reflectively
they
all
go
the
best
of
them
first
after
all
we
been
making
a
lot
of
noise
about
wanting
to
get
into
the
thing
now
we
in
and
that
the
first
price
we
pay
the
a
door
slammed
and
clayton
heard
graham
coming
down
he
passed
the
library
door
however
and
clayton
suddenly
realized
that
he
was
going
out
graham
he
called
graham
stopped
and
came
back
slowly
yes
father
he
said
from
the
doorway
are
you
coming
in
i
thought
i
go
out
for
a
hit
of
a
spin
if
you
do
mind
evening
the
boy
was
shaken
clayton
knew
it
from
his
tone
all
the
fine
vigor
of
the
early
evening
was
gone
and
an
overwhelming
rage
filled
him
against
natalie
against
himself
even
against
the
boy
trouble
which
should
have
united
his
house
had
divided
it
the
first
threat
of
trouble
indeed
you
can
go
out
later
he
said
rather
sharply
we
ought
to
talk
things
over
graham
this
is
a
mighty
serious
what
the
use
of
talking
things
over
father
we
do
know
anything
but
that
we
may
declare
that
enough
is
it
but
he
was
startled
when
he
saw
graham
face
he
was
very
pale
and
his
eyes
already
looked
furtive
they
were
terribly
like
natalie
eyes
sometimes
the
frankness
was
gone
out
of
them
he
came
into
the
room
and
stood
there
rigid
i
promised
mother
to
get
her
some
she
bad
things
said
nolan
get
her
to
take
some
exercises
by
an
open
window
and
she
sleep
like
a
do
you
mind
if
i
go
father
clayton
saw
that
it
was
of
no
use
to
urge
the
boy
graham
wanted
to
avoid
him
wanted
to
avoid
an
interview
the
early
glow
of
the
evening
faded
once
again
the
sense
of
having
lost
his
son
almost
overwhelmed
him
very
well
he
said
stiffly
and
graham
went
out
however
he
did
not
leave
the
house
at
the
door
he
met
doctor
haverford
and
delight
and
clayton
heard
the
clergyman
big
bass
booming
through
the
hall
like
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
he
was
saying
and
i
a
man
of
peace
when
he
came
into
the
library
he
was
still
holding
forth
with
an
affectation
of
rage
i
ask
you
clayton
he
said
what
refuge
is
there
for
a
man
of
peace
my
own
child
leading
me
out
into
the
night
and
inquiring
on
the
way
over
if
i
did
not
feel
that
the
commandment
not
to
kill
was
a
serious
of
course
he
going
she
said
he
has
been
making
the
most
outrageous
excuses
just
to
hear
mother
and
me
reply
to
them
and
all
the
time
nothing
would
hold
him
my
dear
said
the
rector
solemnly
t
shall
have
to
tell
you
something
i
shall
have
to
lay
bare
the
secrets
of
my
heart
how
are
you
nolan
delight
they
will
not
take
me
i
have
three
back
teeth
on
a
plate
i
have
never
told
you
this
before
i
did
not
wish
to
ruin
your
belief
that
i
am
perfect
but
in
the
laugh
that
greeted
this
graham
returned
he
was
clayton
saw
vaguely
puzzled
by
the
rector
and
rather
incredulous
as
to
attitude
do
you
really
want
him
to
go
he
asked
her
of
course
are
you
going
is
everybody
who
is
worth
anything
going
i
go
myself
if
i
could
you
do
know
how
lucky
you
but
is
your
mother
willing
why
what
sort
of
a
mother
do
you
think
i
have
clayton
overheard
that
and
he
saw
graham
wince
his
own
hands
clenched
what
a
power
in
the
world
a
brave
woman
was
and
what
evil
could
be
wrought
by
a
woman
without
moral
courage
a
selfish
woman
he
brought
himself
up
short
at
that
others
came
in
hutchinson
from
the
mill
terry
mackenzie
rodney
page
in
evening
clothes
and
on
his
way
from
the
opera
to
something
or
other
in
a
corner
graham
and
delight
talked
the
rector
in
a
high
state
of
exaltation
was
inclined
to
be
oratorical
and
a
trifle
noisy
he
dilated
on
the
vast
army
that
would
rise
overnight
at
the
call
he
considered
the
raising
of
a
company
from
his
own
church
and
nominated
clayton
as
its
captain
nolan
grinned
sardonically
precisely
he
said
dryly
clayton
because
he
looks
like
a
greek
god
is
ideally
fitted
to
lead
a
lot
of
men
who
never
saw
a
bayonet
outside
of
a
museum
against
trained
fighting
men
there
a
difference
you
know
dominie
between
a
clay
pigeon
and
a
german
with
a
bomb
in
one
hand
and
a
bayonet
in
the
we
did
that
in
the
civil
we
did
and
it
took
four
years
to
fight
a
we
must
have
an
army
i
daresay
you
grant
well
you
can
bet
on
one
thing
we
not
going
to
have
every
ward
boss
who
wants
to
make
a
record
raising
a
regiment
out
of
his
henchmen
and
leading
them
to
what
would
you
suggest
inquired
the
rector
rather
crestfallen
i
suggest
training
men
as
officers
and
then
a
never
come
to
it
in
the
hutchinson
spoke
up
i
heard
men
in
the
mill
talking
they
go
some
of
them
but
they
wo
be
driven
it
would
be
civil
clayton
glanced
at
graham
as
he
replied
the
boy
was
leaning
forward
listening
there
this
to
be
said
for
the
draft
he
said
under
the
volunteer
system
the
best
of
our
boys
will
go
first
that
what
happened
in
england
and
they
were
wiped
out
it
every
man
war
now
there
is
no
reason
why
the
few
should
be
sacrificed
for
the
and
there
this
too
graham
broke
in
he
was
flushed
and
nervous
a
fellow
would
have
to
go
he
would
be
having
to
think
whether
his
going
would
hurt
anybody
or
not
he
would
have
to
decide
he
just
there
was
a
little
hush
in
the
room
then
nolan
spoke
he
said
the
only
trouble
about
it
is
that
it
likely
to
leave
out
some
of
us
old
chaps
who
like
to
have
a
fist
in
hutchinson
remained
after
the
others
had
gone
he
wanted
to
discuss
the
change
in
status
of
the
plant
we
be
taken
over
by
the
government
probably
clayton
told
him
they
have
all
the
figures
capacity
and
so
on
the
ordnance
department
has
that
in
hutchinson
nodded
he
had
himself
made
the
report
we
have
to
look
out
more
than
ever
i
suppose
he
said
as
he
rose
to
go
the
government
is
guarding
all
bridges
and
railways
already
met
a
lot
of
national
guard
boys
on
the
graham
left
when
he
did
offering
to
take
him
to
his
home
and
clayton
sat
for
some
time
alone
smoking
and
thinking
so
the
thing
had
come
at
last
a
year
from
now
and
where
would
they
all
be
the
men
who
had
been
there
himself
graham
would
they
all
be
even
living
would
graham
he
looked
back
over
the
years
graham
a
baby
splashing
water
in
his
bath
and
shrieking
aloud
with
joy
graham
in
his
first
clothes
riding
a
velocipede
in
the
park
and
bringing
in
bruises
of
an
amazing
size
and
blackness
graham
going
away
to
school
and
manfully
fixing
his
mind
on
his
first
long
trousers
so
he
would
not
cry
graham
at
college
coming
in
with
the
winning
crew
and
stumbling
half
collapsed
into
the
arms
of
a
waiting
cheering
crowd
and
the
graham
who
had
followed
his
mother
up
the
stairs
that
night
to
come
down
baffled
thwarted
miserable
he
rose
and
threw
away
his
cigar
he
must
have
the
thing
out
with
natalie
the
boy
soul
was
more
important
than
his
body
he
wanted
him
safe
god
how
he
wanted
him
safe
but
he
wanted
him
to
be
a
man
natalie
room
was
dark
when
he
went
in
he
hesitated
then
he
heard
her
in
bed
sobbing
quietly
he
was
angry
at
himself
for
his
impatience
at
the
sound
he
stood
beside
the
bed
and
forced
a
gentleness
he
did
not
feel
can
i
get
you
anything
he
asked
no
thank
and
he
moved
toward
the
lamp
do
turn
the
light
on
i
look
shall
i
ring
for
madeleine
no
graham
is
bringing
me
a
if
you
are
not
sleepy
may
i
talk
to
you
about
some
things
i
sick
clay
my
head
is
sometimes
it
helps
to
talk
out
our
worries
he
was
still
determinedly
gentle
he
heard
her
turning
her
pillow
and
settling
herself
more
comfortably
not
to
you
you
made
up
your
mind
what
the
use
made
up
my
mind
to
what
to
sending
graham
to
be
that
hardly
worthy
of
you
natalie
he
said
gravely
he
is
my
son
too
i
love
him
at
least
as
much
as
you
do
i
do
think
this
is
really
up
to
us
anyhow
it
is
up
to
him
if
he
wants
to
go
she
sat
up
suddenly
her
voice
thin
and
high
how
does
he
know
what
he
wants
she
demanded
he
too
young
he
does
know
what
war
is
you
say
so
yourself
you
say
he
is
too
young
to
have
a
position
worth
while
at
the
plant
but
of
course
he
old
enough
to
go
to
war
and
have
a
leg
shot
off
or
to
be
blinded
or
her
voice
broke
he
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
felt
around
until
he
found
her
hand
but
she
jerked
it
from
him
you
promised
me
once
to
let
him
make
his
own
decision
if
the
time
when
did
i
promise
that
in
the
fall
when
i
came
home
from
i
never
made
such
a
will
you
make
it
now
no
he
rose
more
nearly
despairing
than
he
had
ever
been
he
could
not
argue
with
a
hysterical
woman
he
hated
cowardice
but
far
deeper
than
that
was
his
conviction
that
she
had
already
exacted
some
sort
of
promise
and
the
boy
was
not
like
her
in
that
respect
he
regarded
a
promise
as
almost
in
the
nature
of
an
oath
he
himself
had
taught
him
that
in
the
creed
of
a
gentleman
a
promise
was
a
thing
of
his
honor
to
be
kept
at
any
cost
you
are
compelling
me
to
do
a
strange
and
hateful
thing
he
said
if
you
intend
to
use
your
influence
to
keep
him
out
i
shall
have
to
offset
it
by
urging
him
to
go
that
is
putting
a
very
terrible
responsibility
on
he
heard
her
draw
her
breath
sharply
if
you
do
that
i
shall
leave
you
she
said
in
a
frozen
voice
suddenly
he
felt
sorry
for
her
she
was
so
weak
so
childish
so
cowardly
and
this
was
the
nearest
they
had
come
to
a
complete
break
you
tired
and
nervous
he
said
we
have
come
a
long
way
from
what
i
started
out
to
say
and
a
long
way
from
the
way
things
used
to
be
between
us
if
this
thing
does
not
bring
two
people
together
together
she
cried
shrilly
when
have
we
been
together
not
in
years
you
have
been
married
to
your
business
i
am
only
your
housekeeper
and
graham
mother
and
even
graham
you
are
trying
to
take
away
from
me
oh
go
away
and
let
me
thoughts
that
were
almost
great
had
formulated
themselves
in
his
mind
that
to
die
that
others
might
live
might
be
better
than
to
live
oneself
that
he
loved
his
country
although
he
had
been
shamefaced
about
it
that
america
was
really
the
of
the
world
and
that
perhaps
only
the
white
flame
of
war
would
fuse
it
into
a
great
nation
but
natalie
made
all
these
thoughts
tawdry
she
cheapened
them
she
found
in
him
nothing
fine
therefore
there
was
probably
nothing
fine
in
him
he
went
away
to
lie
awake
most
of
the
night
chapter
xxiii
but
with
the
breaking
off
of
diplomatic
relations
matters
remained
for
a
time
at
a
standstill
natalie
dried
her
eyes
and
ordered
some
new
clothes
and
saw
rather
more
of
rodney
page
than
was
good
for
her
with
the
beginning
of
february
the
country
house
was
far
enough
under
way
for
it
to
be
promised
for
june
and
natalie
the
fundamentals
of
its
decoration
arranged
for
began
to
haunt
shops
accompanied
always
by
rodney
not
that
your
taste
is
not
right
natalie
he
explained
it
is
exquisite
but
these
fellows
are
liars
and
cheats
some
of
them
besides
i
like
trailing
along
if
you
do
trailing
along
was
a
fairly
accurate
phrase
there
was
scarcely
a
day
now
when
natalie
shining
car
with
its
two
men
in
livery
did
not
draw
up
before
rodney
office
building
or
stand
as
unostentatiously
as
a
fire
engine
not
too
near
the
entrance
of
his
club
clayton
going
in
had
seen
it
there
once
or
twice
and
had
smiled
rather
grimly
he
considered
its
presence
there
in
questionable
taste
but
he
felt
no
uneasiness
determined
as
he
was
to
give
natalie
such
happiness
as
was
still
in
him
to
give
he
never
mentioned
these
instances
but
a
day
came
early
in
february
which
was
to
mark
a
change
in
the
relationship
between
natalie
and
rodney
it
started
simply
enough
they
had
lunched
together
at
a
hotel
and
then
went
to
look
at
rugs
rodney
had
found
her
rather
obdurate
as
to
old
rugs
they
were
still
arguing
the
matter
in
the
limousine
i
just
do
like
to
think
of
all
sorts
of
dirty
turks
and
arabs
having
used
them
she
protested
slept
on
them
walked
on
them
spilled
things
on
the
ugh
but
the
colors
natalie
dear
the
old
faded
the
the
there
is
a
beauty
about
age
you
know
lovely
as
you
are
you
be
even
lovelier
as
an
old
i
getting
there
rather
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
critically
no
slightest
aid
that
she
had
given
her
beauty
missed
his
eyes
the
delicate
artificial
lights
in
her
hair
her
eyebrows
drawn
to
a
hair
breadth
and
carefully
arched
the
touch
of
rouge
under
her
eyes
and
on
the
lobes
of
her
ears
but
she
was
beautiful
no
matter
what
art
had
augmented
her
real
prettiness
she
was
a
charming
finished
product
from
her
veil
and
hat
to
her
narrowly
shod
feet
he
liked
finished
things
well
done
he
liked
the
glaze
on
a
porcelain
he
liked
the
perfect
lacquering
on
the
chinese
screen
he
had
persuaded
natalie
to
buy
he
preferred
wood
carved
into
the
fine
lines
of
sheraton
to
the
trees
that
grow
in
the
park
for
instance
through
which
they
were
driving
a
sheraton
sideboard
was
art
even
certain
forms
of
colonial
mahogany
were
art
although
he
was
not
fond
of
them
and
natalie
was
art
even
if
she
represented
the
creative
instincts
of
her
dressmaker
and
her
milliner
and
not
her
own
he
did
not
like
a
louis
xv
sofa
the
less
that
it
had
not
carved
itself
possibly
natalie
appealed
then
to
his
collective
instinct
he
had
not
analyzed
it
he
only
knew
that
he
liked
being
with
her
and
he
was
not
annoyed
certainly
by
the
fact
that
he
knew
their
constant
proximity
was
arousing
a
certain
amount
of
comment
so
you
are
very
beautiful
he
said
with
his
appraising
glance
full
on
her
you
are
quite
the
loveliest
woman
i
still
with
a
grown
son
i
am
not
a
boy
myself
you
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
he
hesitated
then
laughed
a
little
i
do
know
he
said
i
did
mean
to
say
that
exactly
of
course
that
fact
is
that
i
rather
glad
you
are
not
a
debutante
you
would
be
giving
me
odds
and
ends
of
dances
if
you
were
you
know
and
shifting
me
as
fast
as
possible
as
it
is
the
coquetry
which
is
a
shallow
woman
substitute
for
passion
stirred
in
her
well
i
awfully
he
turned
and
faced
her
i
wonder
if
you
are
go
on
roddie
as
it
is
as
it
is
he
said
rather
rapidly
you
give
me
a
great
deal
of
happiness
i
ca
say
all
i
would
like
to
but
just
being
with
you
natalie
i
wonder
if
you
know
how
much
it
means
to
me
to
see
you
every
i
like
it
or
i
would
do
but
i
wonder
if
it
means
anything
to
you
curiously
enough
with
the
mere
putting
it
into
words
his
feeling
for
her
seemed
to
grow
he
was
even
somewhat
excited
he
bent
toward
her
his
eyes
on
her
face
and
caught
one
of
her
gloved
hands
he
was
no
longer
flirting
with
a
pretty
woman
he
was
in
real
earnest
but
natalie
was
still
flirting
do
you
want
to
know
why
i
like
to
be
with
you
because
of
course
i
do
or
i
should
does
a
famishing
man
want
water
because
you
are
sane
and
sensible
you
believe
as
i
do
in
going
on
as
normally
as
possible
all
these
people
who
go
around
glooming
because
there
is
a
war
across
the
atlantic
they
are
so
tiresome
good
heavens
the
hysterical
attitude
of
some
women
and
clay
he
released
her
hand
so
you
like
me
because
i
sensible
that
a
good
reason
is
it
good
god
natalie
i
only
sensible
because
i
have
to
be
not
about
the
war
i
not
talking
about
that
about
what
have
i
got
to
do
with
your
being
sensible
and
sane
just
think
about
things
and
you
she
was
greatly
thrilled
and
quite
untouched
it
was
a
pleasant
little
game
and
she
held
all
the
winning
cards
so
she
said
very
softly
we
must
go
on
like
this
you
know
we
must
spoil
and
by
her
very
we
let
him
understand
that
the
plight
was
not
his
but
theirs
they
were
to
suffer
on
she
implied
in
a
mutual
unacknowledged
passion
he
flushed
deeply
but
although
he
was
profoundly
affected
his
infatuation
was
as
spurious
as
her
pretense
of
one
he
was
a
dilettante
in
love
as
he
was
in
art
his
aesthetic
sense
which
would
have
died
of
an
honest
passion
fattened
on
the
very
hopelessness
of
his
beginning
an
affair
with
natalie
confronted
just
then
with
the
privilege
of
marrying
her
he
would
have
drawn
back
in
dismay
since
no
such
privilege
was
to
be
his
however
he
found
a
deep
satisfaction
in
considering
himself
hopelessly
in
love
with
her
he
was
profoundly
sorry
for
himself
he
saw
himself
a
tragic
figure
hopeless
and
wretched
he
longed
for
the
unattainable
he
held
up
empty
hands
to
the
stars
and
by
so
mimicking
the
gesture
of
youth
he
regained
youth
you
wo
cut
me
out
of
your
life
natalie
he
asked
wistfully
and
natalie
who
would
not
have
sacrificed
this
new
thrill
for
anything
real
in
the
world
replied
it
would
be
better
would
it
there
was
real
earnestness
in
his
voice
when
he
spoke
he
had
dramatized
himself
by
that
time
do
take
away
the
only
thing
that
makes
life
worth
living
dear
which
natalie
after
a
proper
hesitation
duly
promised
not
to
do
there
were
other
conversations
after
that
about
marriage
for
instance
which
rodney
broadly
characterized
as
the
failure
of
the
world
he
liked
treading
on
dangerous
ground
when
a
man
has
married
and
had
children
he
has
fulfilled
his
duty
to
the
state
that
all
marriage
is
duty
to
the
state
after
that
he
follows
his
normal
instincts
of
if
you
are
defending
unfaithfulness
not
at
all
i
admire
faithfulness
it
rare
enough
for
admiration
no
i
recognizing
facts
do
you
suppose
even
dear
old
clay
likes
a
pretty
woman
of
course
he
does
it
a
total
difference
of
natalie
what
is
an
incident
to
a
man
is
a
crime
to
a
or
all
this
economic
freedom
of
women
is
going
to
lead
to
other
freedoms
you
what
freedoms
the
right
to
live
wherever
they
please
one
liberty
brings
another
you
know
women
used
to
marry
for
a
home
for
some
one
to
keep
them
now
they
need
but
they
have
to
live
just
the
i
wish
you
would
rodney
it
so
it
was
cheap
it
was
the
old
game
of
talking
around
conversational
corners
of
whispering
behind
mental
doors
it
was
insidious
dangerous
and
tantalizing
it
made
between
them
a
bond
of
lowered
voices
of
being
on
the
edge
of
things
their
danger
was
as
spurious
as
their
passion
but
natalie
without
humor
and
without
imagination
found
the
sense
of
insecurity
vaguely
attractive
fundamentally
cold
she
liked
the
idea
of
playing
with
fire
chapter
xxiv
when
war
was
not
immediately
declared
the
rector
who
on
the
sunday
following
that
eventful
saturday
of
the
president
speech
to
congress
had
preached
a
rousing
call
to
arms
began
to
feel
a
bit
sheepish
about
it
war
or
no
war
my
dear
he
said
to
delight
it
made
them
think
for
as
much
as
an
hour
and
i
can
change
it
somewhat
and
use
it
again
if
the
time
really
stuff
she
scoffed
you
with
your
old
sermons
and
mother
with
my
old
dresses
but
it
was
a
good
sermon
she
added
i
have
hardly
been
civil
to
that
german
laundress
good
gracious
delight
ca
you
remember
that
we
must
love
our
enemies
do
you
love
them
you
know
perfectly
well
that
the
moment
you
get
on
the
other
side
if
you
do
you
be
jerking
the
cross
off
your
collar
and
bullying
some
wretched
soldier
to
give
you
his
he
had
a
guilty
feeling
that
she
was
right
it
was
february
then
and
they
were
sitting
in
the
parish
house
delight
had
been
filling
out
reports
to
parents
an
innovation
she
detested
for
a
little
while
there
was
only
the
scratching
of
her
pen
to
be
heard
and
an
occasional
squeal
from
the
church
proper
where
the
organ
was
being
repaired
the
rector
sat
back
in
his
chair
his
fingertips
together
and
whistled
noiselessly
a
habit
of
his
when
he
was
disturbed
now
and
then
he
glanced
at
delight
bent
head
my
dear
he
commented
finally
just
a
minute
that
wretched
little
simonton
girl
has
been
absent
three
sundays
out
of
four
and
on
the
fourth
one
she
said
she
had
a
toothache
and
sat
outside
on
the
steps
well
daddy
do
you
see
anything
of
graham
spencer
now
very
she
looked
at
him
with
frank
eyes
he
has
changed
somehow
daddy
when
we
do
meet
he
is
queer
i
sometimes
think
he
avoids
he
fell
back
on
his
noiseless
whistling
and
delight
who
knew
his
every
mood
got
up
and
perched
herself
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
do
you
get
to
thinking
things
she
said
and
slipped
an
arm
around
his
neck
i
did
think
in
the
winter
i
tell
you
about
that
she
broke
in
bravely
i
suppose
if
cared
for
me
at
all
i
have
been
crazy
about
him
it
is
because
he
good
looking
i
well
i
do
know
why
i
just
know
as
long
as
i
can
remember
i
however
that
not
important
he
thinks
i
a
nice
little
thing
and
lets
it
go
at
that
it
a
good
bit
worse
of
course
than
having
him
hate
sometimes
i
think
you
are
not
very
i
happier
than
i
would
be
trying
to
make
him
fall
in
love
with
me
oh
you
need
be
shocked
it
can
be
done
lots
of
girls
do
it
it
is
any
moral
sense
that
keeps
me
from
it
either
it
just
my
dear
and
there
another
angle
to
it
i
would
marry
a
man
who
has
got
a
mind
of
his
own
even
if
i
had
the
chance
which
i
have
that
silly
mother
of
his
she
is
silly
daddy
and
selfish
do
you
know
what
she
is
doing
now
we
ought
not
to
discuss
her
she
fiddlesticks
you
love
gossip
and
you
know
her
tone
was
light
but
the
rector
felt
that
arm
around
his
neck
tighten
he
surmised
a
depth
of
feeling
that
made
him
anxious
she
is
trying
to
marry
him
to
marion
the
rector
sat
up
almost
guiltily
but
are
you
sure
she
is
doing
that
everybody
says
so
she
thinks
that
if
he
is
married
and
there
is
a
war
he
wo
want
to
go
if
he
has
a
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
marion
will
drive
him
straight
to
the
devil
the
rector
reached
up
and
took
her
hand
she
cared
more
than
she
would
admit
he
saw
she
had
thought
the
thing
out
perhaps
in
the
long
night
when
he
slept
placidly
thought
and
suffered
he
surmised
and
again
he
remembered
his
worldly
plans
for
her
and
felt
justly
punished
i
suppose
it
is
hard
for
a
father
to
understand
how
any
one
can
know
his
little
girl
and
not
love
her
or
be
the
better
for
she
kissed
him
and
slid
off
the
arm
of
his
chair
do
you
worry
she
said
cheerfully
i
had
to
make
an
ideal
for
myself
about
somebody
every
girl
does
sometimes
it
the
plumber
it
does
really
matter
who
it
is
so
you
can
pin
your
dreams
to
him
the
only
thing
that
hurts
is
that
graham
was
worth
she
went
back
to
her
little
cards
but
some
ten
minutes
later
the
rector
lost
in
thought
heard
the
scratching
of
her
pen
cease
did
you
ever
think
daddy
she
said
of
the
influence
women
have
over
men
look
at
the
spencers
spencer
spoiling
graham
and
making
her
husband
desperately
unhappy
and
unhappy
what
makes
you
think
that
he
looks
the
rector
was
startled
he
had
an
instant
vision
of
clayton
spencer
tall
composed
handsome
impeccably
clothed
he
saw
him
in
the
setting
that
suited
him
best
the
quiet
elegance
of
his
home
clayton
unhappy
nonsense
but
he
was
uneasy
too
that
very
gravity
which
he
had
noticed
lately
that
was
certainly
not
the
gravity
of
an
entirely
happy
man
clayton
had
changed
somehow
was
there
trouble
there
and
if
there
were
why
the
rector
who
reduced
most
wretchedness
to
terms
of
dollars
and
cents
of
impending
bills
and
small
deprivations
found
himself
at
a
loss
i
am
sure
you
are
wrong
he
objected
rather
feebly
delight
eyed
him
with
the
scorn
of
nineteen
for
fifty
i
wonder
what
you
would
do
she
observed
if
mother
just
lay
around
all
day
and
had
her
hair
done
and
got
new
clothes
and
never
thought
a
thought
of
her
own
and
just
used
you
as
a
sort
of
walking
my
dear
i
really
can
not
i
tell
you
what
you
do
she
persisted
you
fall
in
love
with
somebody
else
probably
or
else
you
just
naturally
dry
up
and
be
made
a
he
was
extremely
shocked
at
that
and
a
little
hurt
it
took
her
some
time
to
establish
cheerful
relations
again
and
a
very
humble
apology
but
her
words
stuck
in
the
rector
mind
he
made
a
note
for
a
sermon
with
the
text
her
children
arise
up
and
call
her
blessed
her
husband
also
and
he
praiseth
he
went
quietly
into
the
great
stone
building
and
sat
down
the
organist
was
practicing
the
introit
anthem
and
half
way
up
the
church
a
woman
was
sitting
quietly
the
rector
leaned
back
and
listened
to
the
music
he
often
did
that
when
he
had
a
sermon
in
his
mind
it
was
peaceful
and
quiet
hard
to
believe
in
that
peace
of
great
arches
and
swelling
music
that
across
the
sea
at
that
moment
men
were
violating
that
fundamental
law
of
the
church
thou
shalt
not
the
woman
turned
her
head
and
he
saw
that
it
was
audrey
valentine
he
watched
her
with
kindly
speculative
eyes
frivolous
audrey
sitting
alone
in
the
church
she
had
so
casually
attended
surely
that
was
one
of
the
gains
of
war
people
all
came
to
it
ultimately
they
held
on
with
both
hands
as
long
as
they
could
and
then
they
found
their
grasp
growing
feeble
and
futile
and
they
turned
to
the
great
strength
the
organist
had
ceased
audrey
was
kneeling
now
the
rector
eyes
on
the
gleaming
cross
above
the
altar
repeated
softly
save
and
deliver
us
we
humbly
beseech
thee
from
the
hands
of
our
enemies
that
we
being
armed
with
thy
defense
may
be
preserved
evermore
from
all
audrey
was
coming
down
the
aisle
she
did
not
see
him
she
had
indeed
the
fixed
eyes
of
one
who
still
looks
inward
she
was
very
pale
but
there
was
a
new
look
of
strength
in
her
face
as
of
one
who
has
won
a
victory
to
glorify
thee
who
are
the
only
giver
of
all
victory
through
the
merits
of
thy
son
jesus
christ
our
lord
finished
the
rector
chapter
xxv
on
the
last
day
of
february
audrey
came
home
from
her
shorthand
class
and
stood
wearily
by
the
window
too
discouraged
even
to
remove
her
hat
the
shorthand
was
a
failure
the
whole
course
was
a
failure
she
had
not
the
instinct
for
plodding
for
the
meticulous
attention
to
detail
that
those
absurd
irrational
lines
and
hooks
and
curves
demanded
she
could
not
even
spell
and
an
idiot
of
an
instructor
had
found
fault
with
the
large
square
band
she
wrote
as
being
uncommercial
uncommercial
of
course
it
was
so
was
she
uncommercial
she
had
dreamed
a
dream
of
usefulness
but
after
all
why
was
she
doing
it
we
would
never
fight
here
we
were
saying
to
germany
that
we
had
ceased
to
be
friends
and
letting
it
go
at
that
she
might
go
to
england
they
needed
women
there
but
not
untrained
women
not
she
thought
contemptuously
women
whose
only
ability
lay
in
playing
bridge
or
singing
french
chansons
with
no
particular
voice
after
all
the
only
world
that
was
open
to
her
was
her
old
world
it
liked
her
it
even
understood
her
it
stretched
out
a
tolerant
hand
to
her
i
a
fool
she
reflected
bitterly
i
not
happy
and
i
not
useful
i
might
as
well
play
it
all
i
can
but
her
real
hunger
was
for
news
of
clayton
quite
suddenly
he
had
stopped
dropping
in
on
his
way
he
had
made
himself
the
most
vital
element
in
her
life
and
then
taken
himself
out
of
it
at
first
she
had
thought
he
might
be
ill
it
seemed
too
cruel
otherwise
but
she
saw
his
name
with
increasing
frequency
in
the
newspapers
it
seemed
to
her
that
every
relief
organization
in
the
country
was
using
his
name
and
his
services
so
he
was
not
ill
he
had
tired
of
her
probably
she
had
nothing
to
give
had
no
right
to
give
anything
and
of
course
he
could
not
know
how
much
he
had
meant
to
her
of
courage
to
carry
on
how
the
memory
of
his
big
solid
dependable
figure
had
helped
her
through
the
bad
hours
when
the
thought
of
chris
defection
had
left
her
crushed
and
abject
she
told
herself
that
the
reason
she
wanted
to
see
natalie
was
because
she
had
neglected
her
shamefully
perhaps
that
was
what
was
wrong
with
clay
perhaps
he
felt
that
by
avoiding
natalie
she
was
putting
their
friendship
on
a
wrong
basis
actually
she
had
reached
that
point
all
loving
women
reach
when
even
to
hear
a
beloved
name
coming
out
of
a
long
silence
was
both
torture
and
necessity
she
took
unusual
pains
with
her
dress
that
afternoon
and
it
was
a
very
smart
slightly
rouged
and
rather
swaggering
audrey
who
made
her
first
call
in
weeks
on
natalie
that
afternoon
natalie
was
a
little
stiff
still
slightly
affronted
i
thought
you
must
have
left
town
she
said
but
you
look
as
though
you
been
having
a
rest
rouge
said
audrey
coolly
no
i
have
been
entirely
there
are
all
sorts
of
stories
going
about
that
you
going
into
a
hospital
that
you
learning
to
fly
that
you
in
the
secret
service
just
because
i
find
it
stupid
going
about
without
a
man
natalie
eyed
her
shrewdly
but
there
was
no
in
audrey
face
if
the
stories
were
true
and
there
had
been
another
woman
she
was
carrying
it
off
well
at
least
chris
is
in
france
i
have
to
go
when
i
go
without
clay
and
there
is
no
excuse
you
mean
he
is
working
not
at
night
he
is
simply
obstinate
he
says
he
is
tired
i
really
mind
any
more
he
is
so
hatefully
heavy
these
heavy
clay
my
dear
natalie
drew
her
chair
closer
and
lowered
her
voice
what
can
one
do
with
a
man
who
simply
lives
war
he
spends
hours
over
the
papers
he
up
if
the
allies
make
a
gain
and
impossible
if
they
do
i
can
tell
by
the
very
way
he
slams
the
door
of
his
room
when
he
comes
home
what
the
news
is
it
audrey
flushed
i
wish
there
were
more
like
but
natalie
smiled
tolerantly
you
are
not
married
to
him
i
suppose
the
war
is
important
but
i
want
it
hours
a
day
i
want
to
forget
it
if
i
can
audrey
mouth
twitched
after
all
what
was
the
good
of
talking
to
natalie
she
would
only
be
resentful
how
is
the
house
coming
on
she
asked
she
had
natalie
on
happy
ground
there
for
a
she
looked
at
blueprints
and
sketches
heard
rodney
taste
extolled
listened
to
plans
for
a
which
she
gathered
was
rather
belatedly
to
include
her
and
through
it
all
she
was
saying
to
herself
this
is
his
wife
this
is
the
woman
he
loves
he
has
had
a
child
by
her
he
is
building
this
house
for
her
he
goes
into
her
room
as
chris
came
into
mine
and
she
is
not
good
enough
she
is
not
good
now
that
she
had
seen
natalie
she
knew
why
she
had
not
seen
her
before
she
was
jealous
of
her
jealous
and
contemptuous
suddenly
she
hated
natalie
she
hated
her
because
she
was
clayton
spencer
wife
with
all
that
that
implied
she
hated
her
because
she
was
unworthy
of
him
she
hated
her
because
she
loved
clay
and
hated
her
more
because
she
loved
herself
more
than
she
loved
him
audrey
sat
back
in
her
chair
and
saw
that
she
had
traveled
a
long
way
along
a
tragic
road
for
the
first
time
in
her
brave
and
reckless
life
she
was
frightened
she
was
even
trembling
she
lighted
a
cigaret
from
the
stand
at
natalie
elbow
to
steady
herself
natalie
chattered
on
and
audrey
gave
her
the
occasional
nod
that
was
all
she
needed
she
thought
does
he
know
about
her
is
he
still
fooled
she
is
almost
beautiful
rodney
is
falling
in
love
with
her
probably
does
he
know
that
will
he
care
terribly
if
he
finds
it
out
she
looks
cold
but
one
ca
tell
and
some
men
has
she
a
drop
of
honest
unselfish
passion
in
her
she
got
up
suddenly
heavens
how
late
it
is
she
said
i
must
run
why
not
stay
on
to
dinner
graham
is
seldom
home
and
we
can
talk
if
clay
the
temptation
to
see
clay
again
was
strong
in
audrey
but
suddenly
she
knew
that
she
did
not
want
to
see
them
together
in
the
intimacy
of
their
home
she
did
not
want
to
sit
between
them
at
dinner
and
then
go
away
leaving
them
there
together
and
something
fundamentally
honest
in
her
told
her
that
she
had
no
right
to
sit
at
their
table
i
come
another
time
if
you
ask
me
not
she
said
and
left
rather
precipitately
it
hurt
her
rather
to
have
natalie
with
an
impulsive
gesture
gather
the
flowers
out
of
a
great
jar
and
insist
on
her
carrying
them
home
with
her
it
gave
her
a
miserable
sense
of
playing
unfairly
she
walked
home
the
fresh
air
after
natalie
overheated
room
made
her
more
rational
she
knew
where
she
stood
anyhow
she
was
in
love
with
clayton
spencer
she
had
she
reflected
cynically
been
in
love
before
a
number
of
times
before
she
almost
laughed
aloud
she
had
called
those
things
love
those
sickly
romances
those
feeble
emotions
then
her
eyes
filled
with
unexpected
tears
she
had
always
wanted
some
one
to
make
her
happy
now
she
wanted
to
make
some
one
happy
she
cared
nothing
for
the
cost
she
would
put
herself
out
of
it
altogether
he
was
not
happy
any
one
could
see
that
he
had
everything
but
he
was
not
happy
if
he
belonged
to
her
she
would
live
to
make
him
happy
she
would
suddenly
she
remembered
chris
perhaps
she
did
not
know
how
to
hold
a
man
love
she
had
not
held
him
he
had
protested
that
she
was
the
only
woman
he
had
ever
loved
but
all
the
time
there
had
been
that
other
girl
how
account
for
her
then
he
did
not
think
of
me
she
reflected
defiantly
i
shall
not
think
of
she
was
ashamed
of
that
instantly
after
all
chris
was
doing
a
part
now
she
was
no
longer
angry
with
him
she
had
written
him
that
over
and
over
in
the
long
letters
she
had
made
a
point
of
sending
him
only
she
did
not
love
him
any
more
she
thought
now
that
she
never
had
loved
him
what
about
the
time
when
he
came
back
what
would
she
do
then
she
shivered
but
chris
after
all
was
not
to
come
back
he
would
never
come
back
again
the
cable
was
there
when
she
reached
her
apartment
a
cold
statement
irrefutable
final
she
had
put
the
flowers
on
the
table
and
had
raised
her
hands
to
unpin
her
hat
when
she
saw
it
she
read
it
with
a
glance
first
then
slowly
painfully
her
heart
contracted
as
if
a
hand
had
squeezed
it
she
stood
very
still
not
so
much
stricken
as
horrified
and
her
first
conscious
thought
was
of
remorse
terrible
gasping
remorse
all
that
afternoon
while
she
had
been
hating
natalie
and
nursing
her
love
for
clay
chris
had
been
lying
dead
somewhere
chris
was
dead
she
felt
very
tired
but
not
faint
it
seemed
dreadful
indeed
that
she
could
be
standing
there
full
of
life
while
chris
was
dead
such
grief
as
she
felt
was
for
him
not
for
herself
he
had
loved
life
so
even
when
he
cheapened
it
he
had
wanted
to
live
and
now
he
was
dead
she
who
did
not
care
greatly
to
live
lived
on
and
he
was
gone
all
at
once
she
felt
terribly
alone
she
wanted
some
one
with
her
she
wanted
to
talk
it
all
out
to
some
one
who
understood
she
wanted
clay
she
said
to
herself
that
she
did
not
want
him
because
she
loved
him
all
love
was
dead
in
her
now
she
wanted
him
because
he
was
strong
and
understanding
she
made
this
very
clear
to
herself
because
she
had
a
morbid
fancy
that
chris
might
be
watching
her
there
were
people
who
believed
that
sort
of
thing
to
her
excited
fancy
it
seemed
as
though
chris
cynical
smile
might
flash
out
from
any
dusky
corner
she
knew
she
was
not
being
quite
rational
which
was
strange
because
she
felt
so
strong
and
because
the
voice
with
which
she
called
clayton
number
was
so
steady
she
knew
too
that
she
was
no
longer
in
love
with
clay
because
his
steady
voice
over
the
telephone
left
her
quite
calm
and
unmoved
i
want
you
to
come
up
clay
she
said
if
you
can
i
can
come
at
once
is
anything
wrong
chris
has
been
killed
she
replied
and
hung
up
the
receiver
then
she
sat
down
to
wait
and
to
watch
for
chris
cynical
smile
to
flash
in
some
dusky
corner
clayton
found
her
there
collapsed
in
her
chair
a
slim
girl
with
the
rouge
giving
a
grotesque
vitality
to
her
bloodless
cheeks
she
got
up
very
calmly
and
gave
him
the
cablegram
then
she
fainted
in
a
crumpled
heap
at
his
feet
chapter
xxvi
the
new
munition
plant
was
nearing
completion
situated
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
it
spread
over
a
vast
area
of
what
had
once
been
waste
land
of
the
three
long
buildings
two
were
already
in
operation
and
the
third
was
well
under
way
to
clayton
spencer
it
was
the
realization
of
a
dream
he
never
entered
the
great
enclosure
without
a
certain
surprise
at
the
ease
with
which
it
had
all
been
accomplished
and
a
thrill
of
pride
at
the
achievement
he
found
the
work
itself
endlessly
interesting
the
casts
made
of
his
own
steel
lying
in
huge
rusty
heaps
in
the
yard
the
little
cars
which
carried
them
into
the
plant
the
various
operations
by
which
the
great
lathes
turned
them
out
smooth
and
shining
only
to
lose
their
polish
when
heated
again
they
were
ready
for
the
ponderous
hammer
to
close
their
gaping
jaws
the
delicacy
of
the
work
appealed
to
him
the
machining
to
a
thousandth
of
an
inch
the
fastidious
making
of
the
fuses
tiny
things
almost
microscopic
and
requiring
the
delicate
touch
of
girls
most
of
whom
had
been
watchmakers
and
and
with
each
carload
of
the
finished
shells
that
left
the
plant
he
felt
a
fine
glow
of
satisfaction
the
output
was
creeping
up
soon
they
would
be
making
ten
thousand
shells
a
day
and
every
shell
was
one
more
chance
for
victory
against
the
hun
it
became
an
obsession
with
him
to
make
more
ever
more
as
the
work
advanced
he
found
an
unexpected
enthusiasm
in
graham
here
was
something
to
be
done
a
new
thing
the
steel
mill
had
been
long
established
its
days
went
on
monotonously
the
boy
found
it
noisy
dirty
without
appeal
to
his
imagination
but
the
shell
plant
was
different
there
were
new
problems
to
face
of
labor
of
supplies
of
shipping
and
output
he
was
however
reluctantly
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
the
break
with
germany
was
the
final
step
that
the
government
intended
to
take
that
it
would
not
declare
war
however
the
break
had
done
something
it
had
provided
him
with
men
from
the
local
national
guard
to
police
the
plant
and
he
found
the
government
taking
a
new
interest
an
official
interest
in
his
safety
agents
from
the
military
intelligence
and
the
department
of
justice
scanned
his
employment
lists
and
sent
agents
into
the
plant
in
the
building
where
men
and
women
were
hired
each
applicant
passed
a
desk
where
they
were
quietly
surveyed
by
two
unobstrusive
gentlemen
in
indifferent
business
suits
who
eyed
them
carefully
around
the
fuse
department
where
all
day
girls
and
women
handled
guncotton
and
powder
a
special
guard
was
posted
day
and
night
early
in
march
clayton
put
graham
in
charge
of
the
first
of
the
long
buildings
to
be
running
full
and
was
rewarded
by
a
new
look
in
the
boy
face
he
was
almost
startled
at
the
way
he
took
it
i
do
my
very
best
sir
he
said
rather
huskily
if
i
ca
fight
i
can
help
put
the
swine
out
of
business
he
was
by
that
time
quite
sure
that
natalie
had
extracted
a
promise
of
some
sort
from
the
boy
on
the
rare
occasions
when
graham
was
at
home
he
was
quiet
and
suppressed
he
was
almost
always
at
marion
hayden
in
the
evenings
and
from
things
he
let
fall
clayton
gathered
that
the
irresponsible
group
which
centered
about
marion
was
in
the
boy
own
vernacular
rather
shot
to
tommy
hale
had
gone
to
england
to
join
the
royal
flying
corps
one
or
two
of
them
were
in
canada
trying
to
enlist
there
and
one
evening
graham
brought
home
to
dinner
an
inordinately
tall
and
thin
youngster
in
the
kilts
of
a
regiment
with
an
astounding
length
of
thin
leg
below
his
skirts
who
had
been
one
of
marion
most
reckless
satellites
look
like
a
fool
i
know
sir
said
the
tall
individual
sheepishly
just
had
to
get
in
it
somehow
no
camouflage
about
these
skirts
is
there
and
clayton
had
noticed
with
a
thrill
of
sympathy
how
wistfully
graham
eyed
the
debonnair
young
scot
by
adoption
and
how
buckham
had
hovered
over
him
filling
his
plate
and
his
glass
even
graham
noticed
buckham
old
boy
looks
as
though
he
like
to
kiss
you
sid
he
said
it
the
petticoats
probably
thinks
you
a
i
look
better
with
my
legs
under
the
table
said
the
tall
boy
modestly
clayton
was
still
determined
that
graham
should
fight
the
thing
out
for
himself
he
wished
sometimes
that
he
knew
marion
hayden
attitude
was
she
like
natalie
would
she
if
the
time
came
use
her
undeniable
influence
for
or
against
and
there
again
he
resented
the
influence
of
women
in
the
boy
life
why
could
he
make
his
own
decisions
why
could
they
let
him
make
his
own
decisions
he
remembered
his
father
and
how
his
grandmother
in
had
put
a
bible
into
one
pocket
and
a
housewife
into
another
and
had
sent
him
off
to
war
had
the
fiber
of
our
women
weakened
since
then
but
he
knew
it
had
not
all
day
in
the
new
plant
women
were
working
with
quite
calmly
and
there
were
audrey
and
the
haverford
women
strong
enough
in
all
conscience
every
mental
path
those
days
somehow
led
eventually
to
audrey
she
was
the
lighted
window
at
the
end
of
the
long
trail
graham
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
trying
to
work
out
his
own
salvation
he
blundered
as
youth
always
blunders
and
after
a
violent
scene
with
marion
hayden
he
made
an
attempt
to
break
off
his
growing
intimacy
with
anna
klein
to
find
as
many
a
man
had
before
him
that
the
sheer
brutality
of
casting
off
a
loving
woman
was
beyond
him
the
scene
with
marion
came
one
sunday
in
the
spencer
house
with
natalie
asleep
after
luncheon
and
clayton
walking
off
a
sense
of
irritation
in
the
park
he
did
not
like
the
hayden
girl
he
could
not
fathom
natalie
change
of
front
with
regard
to
graham
and
the
girl
he
had
gone
out
leaving
them
together
and
marion
had
launched
her
attack
fiercely
now
she
cried
i
could
come
last
night
that
all
it
is
certainly
not
all
why
could
you
come
i
worked
where
at
the
that
a
lie
graham
i
called
the
plant
i
tell
you
where
you
were
you
were
out
with
a
girl
you
were
seen
if
you
want
to
know
oh
if
you
are
going
to
believe
everything
you
hear
about
me
do
act
like
a
child
who
was
the
girl
it
is
like
you
to
be
jealous
marion
i
let
you
run
around
all
the
time
with
other
fellows
but
the
minute
i
take
a
girl
out
for
a
little
spin
you
jealous
she
laughed
nastily
but
she
knew
she
was
losing
her
temper
and
brought
herself
up
short
let
him
think
she
was
jealous
what
really
ailed
her
was
deadly
fear
lest
her
careful
plan
go
astray
she
was
terrified
that
was
all
and
she
meant
to
learn
who
the
girl
was
i
know
who
it
was
she
hazarded
i
think
you
are
it
was
delight
delight
she
knew
then
that
she
was
wrong
but
it
was
her
chance
to
assail
delight
and
she
took
it
that
child
she
continued
contemptuously
do
you
suppose
seen
how
she
looks
at
you
i
not
afraid
of
her
you
are
too
much
a
man
of
the
world
to
let
her
put
anything
over
on
you
at
least
i
thought
you
were
of
course
if
you
like
milk
and
water
it
was
not
delight
he
said
doggedly
and
i
do
think
we
need
to
bring
her
into
this
at
all
she
not
in
love
with
me
she
would
wipe
her
feet
on
which
was
unfortunate
marion
smiled
slowly
oh
but
you
are
good
enough
for
me
to
be
engaged
to
i
wonder
he
went
to
the
window
and
stood
for
a
moment
looking
out
then
he
went
slowly
back
to
her
i
not
good
enough
for
you
to
be
engaged
to
marion
he
said
i
do
you
want
to
call
it
a
day
she
was
really
terrified
then
she
went
white
and
again
miserably
he
mistook
her
agitation
for
something
deeper
you
want
to
break
the
engagement
not
if
you
still
want
me
i
only
mean
i
a
pretty
poor
sort
you
ought
to
have
the
best
and
god
help
this
country
if
i
the
graham
you
in
some
sort
of
trouble
he
drew
himself
up
in
boyish
bravado
he
could
not
tell
her
the
truth
it
opened
up
too
hideous
a
vista
even
his
consciousness
of
the
fact
that
the
affair
with
anna
was
still
innocent
did
not
dull
his
full
knowledge
of
whither
it
was
trending
he
was
cold
and
wretched
it
nothing
he
muttered
you
can
tell
me
you
can
tell
me
anything
i
know
a
lot
you
see
no
silly
kitten
if
you
in
a
fix
i
help
you
i
do
care
what
it
is
i
help
you
i
i
crazy
about
you
anna
words
too
look
here
marion
he
said
roughly
you
got
to
do
one
of
two
things
either
marry
me
or
let
me
let
you
go
i
like
that
if
that
is
how
you
feel
oh
he
threw
up
his
arm
i
want
you
you
know
that
marry
me
i
will
not
do
you
think
i
going
to
come
into
this
family
and
have
you
cut
off
do
you
suppose
i
know
that
clayton
spencer
hates
the
very
chair
i
sit
on
he
come
and
beg
me
to
marry
you
some
day
until
then
you
wo
do
it
certainly
and
again
he
felt
desperately
his
powerlessness
to
loosen
the
coils
that
were
closing
round
him
fetters
forged
of
his
own
red
blood
his
own
youth
the
she
was
watching
him
with
her
calculating
glance
you
must
be
in
trouble
she
said
if
i
am
it
you
and
mother
who
have
driven
me
he
was
alarmed
then
and
lapsed
into
dogged
silence
his
anxiety
had
forced
into
speech
thoughts
that
had
never
before
been
articulate
he
was
astounded
to
hear
himself
uttering
them
although
with
the
very
speaking
he
realized
now
that
they
were
true
sorry
marion
he
muttered
i
did
mean
all
that
i
excited
that
when
he
sat
down
beside
her
again
and
tried
to
take
her
hand
she
drew
it
away
you
been
very
cruel
graham
she
said
i
been
selfish
every
girl
who
is
terribly
in
love
is
selfish
i
am
going
to
give
you
your
ring
and
leave
you
free
to
do
whatever
you
her
generosity
overcame
him
he
was
instantly
ashamed
humbled
do
he
begged
do
let
me
go
i
just
go
to
the
dogs
if
you
really
care
care
she
said
softly
and
as
he
buried
his
head
in
her
lap
she
stroked
his
hair
softly
her
eyes
triumphant
surveyed
the
long
room
with
its
walls
its
french
furniture
its
long
narrow
mirrors
softening
the
angles
of
the
four
corners
some
day
all
this
would
be
hers
for
this
she
would
exchange
the
untidy
and
imitation
elegance
of
her
present
setting
she
stroked
the
boy
head
absently
graham
made
an
attempt
to
free
himself
the
next
day
he
was
about
to
move
his
office
to
the
new
plant
and
he
made
a
determination
not
to
take
anna
with
him
he
broke
it
to
her
as
gently
as
he
could
mr
weaver
is
taking
my
place
here
he
said
avoiding
her
eyes
yes
he
there
ought
to
be
some
one
here
who
knows
the
do
you
mean
me
well
you
know
them
do
you
he
had
tried
to
smile
at
her
do
you
mean
that
you
are
going
to
have
another
secretary
at
the
plant
look
here
anna
he
said
impulsively
you
know
things
ca
go
on
indefinitely
the
way
we
are
now
you
know
it
do
she
looked
down
and
nodded
well
do
you
think
i
better
leave
you
here
she
fumbled
nervously
with
her
i
wo
stay
here
if
you
go
she
said
finally
i
hate
weaver
afraid
of
him
i
oh
do
leave
me
graham
do
i
have
anybody
but
you
i
have
any
home
not
a
real
home
you
ought
to
see
him
these
she
always
referred
to
her
father
as
he
dreadful
only
happy
when
i
here
with
he
was
angry
out
of
sheer
despair
i
told
you
he
said
things
ca
go
on
as
they
are
you
know
well
enough
what
i
mean
i
older
than
you
are
anna
god
knows
i
want
any
harm
to
come
to
you
through
me
but
if
we
continue
to
be
together
i
not
blaming
she
looked
at
him
honestly
i
just
rather
have
you
care
about
me
than
marry
anybody
he
kissed
her
with
a
curious
mingling
of
exultation
and
despair
he
left
her
there
when
he
went
away
that
afternoon
a
rather
downcast
young
figure
piling
up
records
and
and
following
him
to
the
door
with
worshiping
anxious
eyes
later
on
in
the
afternoon
joey
wandering
in
from
clayton
office
on
one
of
his
observation
tours
found
her
crying
softly
while
she
wiped
her
typewriter
preparatory
to
covering
it
for
the
night
somebody
been
treatin
you
rough
he
asked
more
sympathetic
than
curious
what
are
you
doing
here
anyhow
she
demanded
angrily
you
always
hanging
around
spying
on
somebody
got
to
keep
an
eye
on
well
you
look
here
he
said
his
face
twitching
with
anxiety
you
get
out
from
under
kid
you
take
my
advice
and
get
out
from
under
something
going
to
just
mind
your
own
business
and
stop
worrying
about
me
that
he
turned
and
started
out
oh
very
well
he
said
sharply
but
you
might
take
a
word
of
warning
anyhow
that
cousin
of
yours
has
got
an
eye
on
you
all
right
and
we
do
want
any
scandal
about
the
we
who
are
me
and
clayton
spencer
said
joey
smartly
and
went
out
banging
the
door
cheerfully
anna
climbed
the
hill
that
night
wearily
but
with
a
sense
of
relief
that
rudolph
had
not
been
waiting
for
her
at
the
yard
gate
she
was
in
no
mood
to
thrust
and
parry
with
him
she
wondered
rather
dully
what
mischief
rudolph
was
up
to
he
was
gaining
a
tremendous
ascendency
over
her
father
she
knew
herman
was
spending
more
and
more
of
his
evenings
away
from
home
creaking
up
the
stairs
late
at
night
shoes
in
hand
to
undress
in
the
cold
darkness
across
the
hall
out
she
asked
katie
sitting
by
the
fire
with
the
evening
paper
conversation
in
the
cottage
was
almost
always
laconic
ate
early
katie
returned
rudolph
was
here
too
i
going
to
quit
if
i
got
to
cook
for
that
sneak
any
longer
you
think
he
had
a
meal
ticket
here
your
supper
on
the
i
not
she
ate
her
supper
however
and
undressed
by
the
fire
then
she
went
and
sat
by
her
window
in
the
gathering
night
she
was
suffering
acutely
graham
was
tired
of
her
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
her
probably
he
had
a
girl
somewhere
else
a
lady
her
idea
of
the
life
of
such
a
girl
had
been
gathered
from
novels
the
sort
that
has
her
breakfast
in
bed
she
muttered
and
has
her
clothes
put
on
her
by
somebody
her
underclothes
too
the
immodesty
of
the
idea
made
her
face
burn
with
anger
late
that
night
herman
came
back
herman
had
been
a
difficult
proposition
for
rudolph
to
handle
his
innate
caution
his
respect
for
law
and
under
his
bullying
exterior
a
certain
physical
cowardice
made
him
slow
to
move
in
the
direction
rudolph
was
urging
he
was
controversial
he
liked
to
argue
over
the
beer
and
schnitzel
rudolph
bought
and
rudolph
was
growing
impatient
rudolph
himself
was
all
eagerness
and
zeal
it
was
his
very
zeal
that
was
his
danger
although
it
brought
him
slavish
followers
he
was
contemptuous
and
impatient
but
of
limited
intelligence
himself
he
understood
for
that
very
reason
the
mental
processes
of
those
he
would
lead
there
was
a
certain
simplicity
even
in
his
cunning
with
herman
he
was
a
ferret
driving
out
of
their
every
evil
instinct
that
lay
dormant
under
his
goading
herman
was
becoming
savage
sullen
and
potentially
violent
he
was
confused
too
rudolph
arguments
always
confused
him
he
was
confused
that
night
heavy
with
fatigue
and
with
rudolph
steady
talk
in
his
ear
he
was
tired
of
pondering
great
questions
tired
of
hearing
about
the
spencers
and
the
money
they
were
making
anna
clothing
was
scattered
about
the
room
and
he
frowned
at
it
she
spent
too
much
money
on
her
clothes
always
sewing
at
something
he
stooped
down
to
gather
up
his
shoes
and
his
ear
thus
brought
close
to
the
table
was
conscious
in
the
silence
of
a
faint
rhythmical
sound
he
stood
up
and
looked
about
then
he
moved
the
newspaper
on
the
table
underneath
it
forgotten
in
her
anxiety
and
trouble
lay
the
little
gold
watch
he
picked
it
up
still
following
his
train
of
thought
it
fitted
into
the
evening
inflammable
proceedings
so
with
such
trinkets
as
this
capital
would
silence
the
cry
of
labor
for
its
just
share
in
the
products
of
its
skill
and
strength
it
would
bribe
and
cheaply
ten
dollars
perhaps
that
ticking
insult
for
ten
dollars
he
held
it
close
to
his
spectacles
ah
but
it
was
not
so
cheap
it
came
from
the
best
shop
in
the
city
he
weighed
it
carefully
in
his
hand
and
in
so
doing
saw
the
monogram
a
doubt
crept
into
his
mind
a
cold
and
chilling
fear
since
when
had
the
spencer
plant
taken
to
giving
watches
for
christmas
the
hill
girls
who
worked
as
stenographers
in
the
plant
they
came
in
often
enough
and
he
did
not
remember
any
watches
or
any
mention
of
watches
his
mind
working
slowly
recalled
that
never
before
had
he
seen
the
watch
near
at
hand
and
he
went
into
a
slow
and
painful
calculation
fifty
dollars
at
least
it
had
cost
a
hundred
stenographers
that
would
be
five
thousand
dollars
for
watches
suddenly
he
knew
that
anna
had
lied
to
him
one
of
two
things
then
either
she
had
spent
money
for
it
unknown
to
him
or
some
one
had
given
it
to
her
there
was
in
his
mind
not
much
difference
in
degree
between
the
two
alternatives
both
were
crimes
of
the
first
magnitude
he
picked
the
watch
up
between
his
broad
thumb
and
forefinger
and
then
his
face
a
cold
and
dreadful
mask
he
mounted
the
stairs
chapter
xxvii
clayton
spencer
was
facing
with
characteristic
honesty
a
situation
that
he
felt
was
both
hopeless
and
shameful
he
was
hopelessly
in
love
with
audrey
he
knew
now
that
he
had
known
it
for
a
long
time
here
was
no
slender
sentiment
no
thin
romance
with
every
fiber
of
him
heart
and
soul
and
body
he
loved
her
and
wanted
her
there
was
no
madness
about
it
save
the
fact
itself
which
was
mad
enough
it
was
not
the
single
attraction
of
passion
although
he
recognized
that
element
as
fundamental
in
it
it
was
the
craving
of
a
strong
man
who
had
at
last
found
his
woman
he
knew
that
as
certainly
as
he
knew
anything
he
did
not
even
question
that
she
cared
for
him
it
was
as
though
they
both
had
passed
through
the
doubting
period
without
knowing
it
and
had
arrived
together
at
the
same
point
the
crying
need
of
each
other
he
rather
thought
looking
back
that
audrey
had
known
it
sooner
than
he
had
she
had
certainly
known
the
night
she
learned
of
chris
death
his
terror
when
she
fainted
the
very
way
he
had
put
her
out
of
his
arms
when
she
opened
her
eyes
those
had
surely
told
her
yet
had
cynical
spirit
been
watching
there
had
been
nothing
even
then
there
was
between
them
nothing
now
he
had
given
way
to
the
people
who
flocked
to
her
with
sympathy
had
called
her
up
now
and
then
had
sent
her
a
few
books
some
flowers
but
the
hopelessness
of
the
situation
held
him
away
from
her
once
or
twice
at
first
he
had
called
her
on
the
telephone
and
had
waited
almost
trembling
for
her
voice
over
the
wire
only
to
ask
her
finally
in
a
voice
chilled
with
repression
how
she
was
feeling
or
to
offer
a
car
for
her
to
ride
in
the
park
and
her
replies
were
equally
perfunctory
she
was
well
she
was
still
studying
but
it
was
going
badly
she
was
too
stupid
to
learn
all
those
once
she
had
said
are
you
ever
coming
to
see
me
clay
her
voice
had
been
wistful
and
it
had
been
a
moment
before
he
had
himself
enough
in
hand
to
reply
formally
thank
you
i
shall
very
but
he
had
not
gone
to
the
little
fiat
again
through
natalie
he
heard
of
her
now
and
then
i
saw
audrey
she
said
once
she
is
not
wearing
mourning
bad
taste
i
should
say
when
one
remembers
that
she
really
drove
chris
to
his
death
he
had
interrupted
her
angrily
that
is
a
cruel
misstatement
natalie
she
did
nothing
of
the
you
need
bite
me
you
know
he
went
and
had
about
as
much
interest
in
this
war
as
as
as
you
have
he
finished
and
had
gone
out
leaving
natalie
staring
after
him
he
was
more
careful
after
that
but
the
situation
galled
him
he
was
no
hypocrite
but
there
was
no
need
of
wounding
natalie
unnecessarily
and
that
after
all
was
the
crux
of
the
whole
situation
natalie
it
was
not
natalie
fault
that
he
had
found
the
woman
of
his
heart
too
late
he
had
no
thought
of
blame
for
her
in
decency
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
he
could
not
play
the
lover
to
her
but
then
he
had
not
done
that
for
a
very
long
time
he
could
see
however
that
she
was
not
hurt
perhaps
in
all
her
futile
life
natalie
had
for
all
her
complaining
never
been
so
content
in
her
husband
as
in
those
early
spring
months
when
she
had
completely
lost
him
he
made
no
demands
whatever
in
the
small
attentions
which
he
had
never
neglected
he
was
even
more
assiduous
he
paid
her
bills
without
comment
he
submitted
in
those
tense
days
when
every
day
made
the
national
situation
more
precarious
to
hours
of
discussion
as
to
the
country
house
to
complaints
as
to
his
own
lack
of
social
instinct
and
to
that
new
phase
of
her
attitude
toward
marion
hayden
that
left
him
baffled
and
perplexed
then
on
the
sunday
when
he
left
graham
and
marion
together
at
the
house
he
met
audrey
quite
by
accident
in
the
park
he
was
almost
incredulous
at
first
she
came
like
the
answer
to
prayer
a
little
tired
around
the
eyes
showing
the
strain
of
the
past
weeks
but
with
that
same
easy
walk
and
unconscious
elegance
that
marked
her
always
she
was
not
alone
there
was
a
tall
blonde
girl
beside
her
hideously
dressed
but
with
a
pleasant
shallow
face
just
before
they
met
audrey
stopped
and
held
out
her
hand
then
you
let
me
know
clare
thank
you
i
will
indeed
with
a
curious
glance
at
clayton
the
girl
went
on
audrey
smiled
at
him
please
do
run
she
said
there
are
people
looking
it
would
be
so
run
he
replied
he
stood
looking
down
at
her
and
at
something
in
his
eyes
her
smile
died
it
too
wonderful
for
a
moment
he
could
not
speak
after
all
those
weeks
of
hunger
for
her
there
was
no
power
in
him
to
dissemble
he
felt
a
mad
boyish
impulse
to
hold
out
his
arms
to
her
malacca
stick
gloves
and
all
it
a
bit
of
luck
i
had
expected
audrey
he
said
at
last
unsteadily
she
turned
about
quite
simply
and
faced
in
the
direction
he
was
going
i
shall
walk
with
you
she
said
with
a
flash
of
her
old
impertinence
you
have
not
asked
me
to
but
i
shall
anyhow
only
do
call
this
luck
it
is
at
all
i
walk
here
every
sunday
and
every
sunday
i
say
to
myself
he
will
think
he
needs
exercise
then
he
will
walk
and
the
likeliest
place
for
him
to
go
is
the
park
good
reasoning
is
it
she
glanced
up
at
him
but
his
face
was
set
and
unsmiling
do
pay
any
attention
to
me
clay
i
a
little
mad
probably
you
see
she
hesitated
i
need
my
friends
just
now
and
when
the
very
best
of
them
all
hides
away
from
me
do
say
that
i
stayed
away
because
he
hesitated
i
almost
through
do
worry
but
i
was
walking
along
before
i
met
clare
i
tell
you
about
her
presently
and
i
was
saying
to
myself
that
i
thought
god
owed
me
something
i
did
know
just
what
happiness
maybe
i
been
careless
and
all
that
but
i
never
been
wicked
and
yet
i
can
look
back
and
count
the
really
happy
days
of
my
life
on
five
she
held
out
one
hand
five
fingers
she
repeated
and
i
am
the
percentage
is
pretty
low
you
perhaps
you
and
i
ask
too
much
he
was
conscious
of
her
quick
searching
glance
oh
you
feel
that
way
too
i
mean
as
i
do
that
it
all
hardly
worth
while
but
you
seem
to
have
everything
you
have
one
thing
i
lack
youth
at
you
can
still
mold
your
life
audrey
dear
you
have
had
a
bad
time
but
with
all
reverence
to
chris
memory
his
going
out
of
it
under
the
circumstances
is
a
grief
but
it
does
spell
do
you
mean
that
i
will
marry
again
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
do
you
think
you
will
some
time
some
nice
young
chap
who
will
worship
you
all
the
days
of
his
life
that
well
that
is
what
i
expect
for
you
it
at
least
possible
you
is
it
what
you
want
for
me
good
god
he
burst
out
his
restraint
suddenly
gone
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
what
can
i
say
except
that
i
want
you
to
be
happy
do
you
think
i
gone
over
it
all
over
and
over
again
i
give
my
life
for
the
right
to
tell
you
the
things
i
think
but
i
have
that
right
even
this
little
time
together
is
wrong
the
way
things
are
it
is
all
i
sorry
clay
i
know
i
am
just
reckless
you
know
i
am
reckless
it
my
vice
but
sometimes
we
better
talk
about
the
but
he
could
not
talk
about
the
mill
just
then
they
walked
along
in
silence
and
after
a
little
he
felt
her
touch
his
arm
would
it
be
better
just
to
have
it
out
she
asked
wistfully
that
would
hurt
anybody
would
it
i
afraid
i
not
she
said
proudly
i
sometimes
think
oh
i
think
such
a
lot
these
days
that
if
we
talked
these
things
over
i
recover
my
friend
i
lost
him
now
you
see
and
i
so
horribly
lonely
lost
him
lost
him
she
repeated
i
lost
my
friend
and
i
have
gained
anything
it
did
hurt
anybody
for
us
to
meet
now
and
then
clay
you
know
that
i
wish
you
would
understand
she
added
impatiently
i
only
want
to
go
back
to
things
as
they
were
i
want
you
to
come
in
now
and
then
we
used
to
talk
about
all
sorts
of
things
and
i
miss
that
plenty
of
people
come
but
that
different
it
only
your
occasional
companionship
i
want
i
do
want
you
to
come
and
make
love
to
you
say
you
have
missed
the
companionship
he
said
rather
unsteadily
i
wonder
if
you
think
i
have
i
know
you
have
my
dear
and
that
is
why
i
want
you
to
come
to
come
without
being
afraid
that
i
expect
or
want
anything
else
surely
we
can
manage
he
smiled
down
at
her
rather
wryly
at
her
straight
courageous
figure
her
brave
eyes
meeting
his
so
directly
how
like
her
it
all
was
the
straightforwardness
of
it
the
absence
of
coquetry
and
once
again
he
knew
not
only
that
he
loved
her
with
all
the
depths
of
him
of
his
strong
body
and
his
vigorous
mind
but
that
she
was
his
woman
the
one
woman
in
the
world
for
him
it
was
as
though
all
his
life
he
had
been
searching
for
her
and
he
had
found
her
and
it
was
too
late
she
knew
it
too
it
was
in
her
very
eyes
i
have
wanted
to
come
terribly
he
said
finally
and
when
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
he
bent
down
and
kissed
it
then
that
settled
she
said
in
a
tone
and
now
tell
you
about
clare
i
rather
proud
of
clare
the
tension
had
been
so
great
that
he
had
forgotten
the
blonde
girl
entirely
do
you
remember
the
night
i
got
a
hundred
dollars
from
you
and
later
on
that
i
asked
you
for
work
in
your
mill
for
the
girl
i
got
it
for
do
you
mean
he
looked
at
her
in
surprise
that
was
the
girl
you
see
she
rather
holds
onto
me
it
awful
in
a
way
too
it
looks
as
though
i
am
posing
as
magnanimous
i
not
clay
if
i
had
cared
awfully
it
would
have
been
different
but
then
if
i
had
cared
awfully
perhaps
it
would
never
have
you
have
nothing
to
blame
yourself
for
well
i
do
rather
but
that
not
the
point
sometimes
when
i
am
alone
i
have
wicked
thoughts
you
know
clay
i
reckless
and
sometimes
i
think
maybe
there
is
only
one
life
and
why
not
get
happiness
out
of
it
i
realize
that
but
for
some
little
kink
in
my
brain
i
might
be
in
clare
position
so
i
do
turn
her
out
she
a
poor
cheap
thing
but
well
she
is
fond
of
me
if
i
had
children
it
funny
but
i
rather
mother
her
and
she
straight
now
straight
as
a
string
she
was
sensitive
to
his
every
thought
and
she
knew
by
the
very
change
in
the
angle
of
his
head
that
he
was
thinking
that
over
and
not
entirely
approving
but
he
said
finally
you
a
big
woman
but
you
do
like
it
i
do
like
her
troubling
troubling
me
she
does
borrow
money
you
know
why
she
makes
more
money
from
your
plant
than
i
have
to
live
on
and
she
brings
me
presents
of
flowers
and
the
most
awful
embroidery
that
she
does
you
ought
not
to
know
that
side
of
she
laughed
a
little
bitterly
not
know
it
she
said
i
had
to
know
it
i
learned
it
pretty
well
too
and
do
make
any
mistake
she
looked
up
at
him
with
her
clear
understanding
gaze
being
good
decent
with
a
lot
of
people
is
only
the
lack
of
temptation
only
thank
god
there
are
some
who
have
the
strength
to
withstand
it
when
it
and
he
read
in
her
clear
eyes
her
promise
and
her
understanding
that
they
loved
each
other
that
it
was
the
one
big
thing
in
both
their
lives
but
that
between
them
there
would
be
only
the
secret
inner
knowledge
of
that
love
there
would
be
no
shipwreck
and
for
what
she
gave
she
demanded
his
strength
and
his
promise
it
was
to
what
he
read
in
her
face
not
to
her
words
that
he
replied
i
do
my
very
best
audrey
he
went
back
to
her
rooms
with
her
and
she
made
him
tea
while
he
built
the
fire
in
the
open
fireplace
and
nursed
it
tenderly
to
a
healthy
strength
overnursed
it
she
insisted
they
were
rather
gay
indeed
and
the
passed
by
safely
there
was
so
much
to
discuss
she
pretended
the
president
unfortunate
phrase
of
peace
without
victory
the
deportation
of
the
belgians
the
recent
leak
in
washington
to
certain
and
more
and
more
imminent
the
possibility
of
a
state
of
war
being
recognized
by
the
government
if
it
comes
she
said
gayly
i
shall
go
of
course
i
shall
go
to
france
and
sing
them
into
battle
my
shorthand
looks
like
a
music
score
as
it
is
what
will
you
do
i
ca
let
you
outshine
me
he
said
and
i
do
want
to
think
of
your
going
over
there
without
me
my
dear
my
dear
she
ignored
that
and
gave
him
his
tea
gravely
chapter
xxviii
when
natalie
roused
from
her
nap
that
sunday
afternoon
it
was
to
find
marion
gone
and
graham
waiting
for
her
in
her
boudoir
through
the
open
door
she
could
see
him
pacing
back
and
forward
and
something
in
his
face
made
her
vaguely
uneasy
she
assumed
the
smile
which
so
often
preserved
her
from
the
disagreeable
what
a
sleep
i
had
she
said
and
yawned
prettily
i
have
one
of
your
cigarets
darling
and
then
let
take
a
graham
knew
natalie
idea
of
a
walk
which
was
three
or
four
blocks
along
one
of
the
fashionable
avenues
with
the
car
within
hailing
distance
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
block
she
always
declared
that
her
shoes
pinched
and
called
the
machine
you
do
really
want
to
walk
of
course
i
do
with
you
ring
for
madeleine
she
was
uncomfortable
graham
had
been
very
queer
lately
he
would
have
long
quiet
spells
and
then
break
out
in
an
uncontrollable
irritation
generally
at
the
servants
but
graham
did
not
ring
for
madeleine
he
lighted
a
cigaret
for
natalie
and
standing
off
surveyed
her
she
was
very
pretty
she
was
prettier
than
toots
that
pale
blue
wrapper
or
whatever
it
was
made
her
rather
exquisite
and
natalie
curled
up
on
her
pale
rose
chaise
longue
set
to
work
as
deliberately
to
make
a
conquest
of
her
son
as
she
had
ever
done
to
conquer
rodney
page
or
the
long
list
of
rodney
predecessors
you
growing
very
handsome
you
know
boy
she
said
almost
too
handsome
a
man
does
need
good
looks
they
almost
a
handicap
look
at
your
they
have
hurt
him
any
i
should
i
do
she
reflected
eyeing
her
cigaret
he
presumes
on
them
rather
and
a
good
many
men
never
think
a
handsome
man
has
any
well
he
fools
them
there
she
raised
her
eyebrows
slightly
tell
me
about
the
new
plant
i
do
know
anything
about
it
yet
he
said
bluntly
and
you
be
really
interested
if
i
that
rather
disagreeable
of
no
i
just
trying
to
talk
straight
for
once
we
you
and
i
we
always
talk
around
things
i
do
know
you
look
terribly
like
your
father
just
now
you
are
quite
that
exactly
what
i
mean
mother
you
do
say
father
is
savage
god
knows
he
is
that
you
just
say
i
act
like
father
and
that
i
am
natalie
blew
a
tiny
cloud
of
cigaret
smoke
and
watched
it
for
a
moment
you
sound
fearfully
involved
but
never
mind
about
that
i
daresay
done
something
i
do
know
what
but
of
course
i
am
why
did
you
bring
marion
here
mother
well
if
you
want
to
know
exactly
i
met
her
coming
out
of
church
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
we
were
having
rather
a
nice
luncheon
and
that
it
would
be
a
pity
not
to
ask
some
one
to
come
in
it
was
a
nice
luncheon
was
it
that
why
you
asked
her
for
food
brutally
put
but
you
have
been
asking
her
here
a
lot
lately
and
yet
the
last
time
we
discussed
her
you
said
she
was
fast
that
she
wanted
to
marry
me
for
my
money
that
people
would
laugh
if
i
fell
for
i
hardly
used
those
words
did
i
for
heaven
sake
mother
he
cried
exasperated
do
quibble
let
get
down
to
facts
does
your
bringing
her
here
mean
that
changed
your
mind
natalie
considered
she
was
afraid
of
too
quick
a
surrender
lest
he
grow
suspicious
she
decided
to
temporize
with
the
affectation
of
frankness
that
had
once
deceived
clayton
and
that
still
she
knew
affected
graham
i
tell
you
exactly
she
said
slowly
at
first
i
thought
it
was
just
an
infatuation
and
you
really
are
young
graham
although
you
look
and
act
like
such
a
man
but
i
feel
now
that
time
has
gone
on
and
you
still
care
about
her
that
after
all
your
happiness
is
all
that
mother
but
she
held
up
her
hand
remember
i
am
only
speaking
for
myself
my
dearest
wish
is
to
make
you
happy
you
are
all
i
have
but
i
can
not
help
you
very
much
your
father
looks
at
those
things
differently
he
does
quite
realize
that
you
are
grown
up
and
have
a
right
to
decide
some
things
for
he
has
moved
me
up
raised
my
that
different
you
valuable
to
him
naturally
i
do
mean
he
does
love
you
she
added
hastily
as
graham
wheeled
and
stared
at
her
of
course
he
does
in
his
own
way
it
not
my
way
but
then
only
a
woman
and
a
you
think
he
object
i
think
he
must
be
handled
if
you
rush
at
him
and
demand
the
right
to
live
your
own
life
it
is
my
precisely
only
he
may
not
see
it
that
he
took
a
step
toward
her
mother
do
you
really
want
me
to
marry
marion
i
think
you
ought
to
be
to
marion
to
some
one
you
circles
again
he
muttered
you
changed
your
mind
for
some
reason
what
is
it
mother
he
had
an
uneasy
thought
that
she
might
have
learned
of
anna
there
was
that
day
for
instance
when
his
father
had
walked
into
the
back
room
natalie
was
following
a
train
of
thought
suggested
by
her
own
anxiety
you
might
be
married
quietly
she
suggested
once
it
was
done
i
am
sure
your
father
would
come
around
you
are
both
of
age
you
he
eyed
her
then
with
amazement
i
darned
if
i
understand
you
he
burst
out
and
then
in
one
of
his
quick
remorses
i
sorry
mother
i
just
puzzled
that
all
but
that
plan
no
good
anyhow
marion
wo
do
it
she
will
have
to
be
welcome
in
the
family
or
she
wo
she
ought
to
be
glad
to
come
any
way
she
can
natalie
said
sharply
and
found
graham
eyes
on
her
studying
her
you
do
want
her
that
plain
but
you
do
want
her
that
not
so
plain
what
the
answer
mother
and
natalie
with
an
irritable
feeing
that
she
had
bungled
somehow
got
up
and
flung
away
the
cigaret
i
am
trying
to
give
you
what
you
want
she
said
pettishly
clear
enough
i
should
there
no
other
reason
what
other
reason
could
there
be
dressing
to
dine
at
the
hayden
that
night
graham
heard
clayton
come
in
and
go
into
his
he
had
an
impulse
to
go
over
tie
in
hand
as
he
was
and
put
the
matter
squarely
before
his
father
the
surely
a
man
would
understand
that
even
anna
and
his
predicament
there
anything
was
better
than
this
constant
indirectness
of
gaining
his
father
views
through
his
mother
had
he
done
so
things
would
have
been
different
later
but
by
continual
suggestion
a
vision
of
his
father
as
hard
detached
immovable
had
been
built
up
in
his
mind
he
got
as
far
as
the
door
hesitated
turned
back
it
was
marion
herself
who
solved
the
mystery
of
natalie
changed
attitude
when
graham
told
of
it
that
night
she
sat
listening
her
eyes
slightly
narrowed
restlessly
turning
her
engagement
ring
well
at
least
that
something
she
said
noncommittally
but
in
her
heart
she
knew
as
one
designing
woman
may
know
another
she
knew
that
natalie
had
made
graham
promise
not
to
enlist
at
once
if
war
was
declared
and
now
she
knew
that
she
was
desperately
preparing
to
carry
her
fear
for
graham
a
step
further
even
at
the
cost
of
having
her
in
the
family
she
smiled
wryly
but
there
was
triumph
in
the
smile
too
she
had
them
now
the
time
would
come
when
they
would
crawl
to
her
to
marry
graham
to
keep
him
from
going
to
war
then
she
would
make
her
own
terms
in
the
meantime
the
thing
was
to
hold
him
by
every
art
she
knew
there
was
another
girl
somewhere
she
had
been
more
frightened
about

herman
klein
watch
between
forefinger
and
thumb
climbed
heavily
to
anna
room
she
heard
him
pause
outside
the
door
and
her
heart
almost
stopped
beating
she
had
been
asleep
and
rousing
at
his
step
she
had
felt
under
the
pillow
for
her
watch
to
see
the
time
it
was
not
there
she
remembered
then
she
had
left
it
below
on
the
table
and
he
was
standing
outside
her
door
she
heard
him
scratching
a
match
striking
it
against
the
panel
of
her
door
for
so
long
as
it
would
take
the
match
to
burn
out
she
heard
him
there
breathing
heavily
then
the
knob
turned
she
leaped
out
of
the
bed
in
a
panic
of
fear
the
hall
like
the
room
was
dark
and
she
felt
his
ponderous
body
in
the
doorway
rather
than
saw
it
you
will
put
on
something
and
come
he
said
harshly
i
will
she
tried
to
keep
her
voice
steady
i
got
to
work
if
you
have
i
got
to
have
my
her
tone
rose
hysterically
if
you
think
you
can
stay
out
half
the
night
and
guzzle
beer
and
then
come
here
to
get
me
up
you
can
think
you
are
already
up
he
said
in
a
voice
slowed
and
thickened
by
rage
you
will
come
he
turned
away
and
descended
the
creaking
stairs
again
she
listened
for
the
next
move
but
he
made
none
she
knew
then
that
he
was
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
was
with
terror
by
that
time
and
she
ran
to
the
window
but
it
was
high
even
if
she
could
have
dropped
out
and
before
she
could
put
on
enough
clothing
to
escape
in
he
would
be
back
again
his
rage
the
greater
for
the
delay
she
slipped
into
a
kimono
and
her
knees
giving
way
under
her
she
went
down
the
stairs
herman
was
waiting
he
moved
under
the
lamp
and
she
saw
that
he
held
the
watch
dangling
now
he
said
where
you
got
this
tell
i
told
you
how
i
got
that
was
a
so
rudolph
had
told
him
i
like
that
she
blustered
trying
to
gain
time
i
guess
it
time
they
gave
me
something
i
worked
hard
enough
they
gave
them
to
all
the
that
is
a
lie
i
like
that
telling
me
i
lying
you
ask
graham
spencer
tell
if
that
is
true
why
do
you
shake
so
you
scare
me
she
burst
into
frightened
tears
i
do
know
what
got
into
you
i
do
my
best
i
give
you
all
i
make
i
kept
this
house
going
and
gained
a
little
courage
i
had
darned
little
thanks
for
you
think
i
believe
the
mill
gave
five
thousand
dollars
in
watches
last
christmas
i
go
with
this
to
clayton
spencer
not
to
that
degenerate
son
of
his
and
i
ask
him
then
i
shall
he
turned
as
if
about
to
leave
her
but
the
alternative
he
offered
her
was
too
terrible
father
she
said
i
tell
you
the
truth
i
bought
it
with
what
money
i
had
a
raise
i
did
tell
you
i
had
a
raise
of
five
dollars
a
week
i
paying
for
it
myself
honest
to
heaven
that
right
so
you
have
had
a
raise
and
you
have
not
told
me
i
give
all
the
rest
to
you
what
do
i
get
out
of
all
my
hard
work
just
a
place
to
live
no
clothes
no
fun
no
anything
all
the
other
girls
have
a
good
time
now
and
then
but
i
just
like
a
prisoner
you
take
all
i
earn
and
i
get
the
her
voice
rose
to
a
terrified
squeal
behind
her
she
heard
the
slovenly
servant
creaking
down
the
stairs
as
herman
moved
toward
her
she
screamed
katie
she
called
quick
help
but
herman
had
caught
her
by
the
shoulder
and
was
dragging
her
toward
a
corner
where
there
hung
a
leather
strap
katie
peering
round
the
door
of
the
enclosed
staircase
saw
him
raise
the
strap
and
anna
white
face
upraised
piteously
for
god
sake
the
strap
descended
even
after
katie
had
rushed
up
the
stairs
and
locked
herself
in
the
room
she
could
hear
above
anna
cries
the
thud
of
the
strap
relentless
terrible
lusty
with
cruelty
herman
went
to
church
the
next
morning
lying
in
her
bed
too
sore
and
bruised
to
move
anna
heard
him
carefully
polishing
his
boots
on
the
side
porch
heard
him
throw
away
the
water
after
he
had
shaved
heard
at
last
the
slam
of
the
gate
as
he
started
upright
in
his
sunday
clothes
for
church
only
when
he
had
reached
the
end
of
the
street
and
katie
could
see
him
picking
his
way
down
the
blackened
hill
did
she
venture
up
with
a
cup
of
coffee
anna
had
to
unlock
her
door
to
admit
her
to
remove
a
further
barricade
of
chairs
when
katie
saw
her
she
almost
dropped
the
cup
you
poor
little
rat
she
said
compassionately
gee
he
was
crazy
i
never
saw
such
a
face
gee
anna
said
nothing
she
dropped
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
took
the
coffee
drinking
gingerly
through
a
lip
swollen
and
cut
i
going
to
leave
katie
went
on
it
be
my
time
next
if
he
tries
any
tricks
on
me
i
have
the
law
on
him
he
a
beast
that
what
he
katie
anna
said
if
i
leave
can
you
get
my
clothes
to
me
i
carry
all
i
he
take
the
strap
to
well
if
you
leaving
anyhow
you
can
put
some
of
my
things
in
your
good
and
right
you
are
to
get
out
katie
agreed
sure
i
do
it
where
do
you
think
you
go
i
thought
last
night
i
jump
in
the
river
i
changed
my
mind
though
i
pay
him
back
and
not
the
way
he
give
it
to
him
good
assented
katie
i
have
liked
to
slip
some
of
that
paris
green
of
his
in
his
coffee
this
morning
and
now
he
off
for
church
the
old
hypocrite
to
katie
curious
inquiries
as
to
the
cause
of
the
beating
anna
was
now
too
committal
i
held
out
some
money
on
him
was
all
she
said
katie
regarded
her
with
a
mixture
of
awe
and
admiration
you
got
your
nerve
she
said
i
wonder
he
did
kill
you
yours
is
his
and
what
his
is
his
own
but
anna
could
not
leave
that
morning
she
lay
in
her
bed
cold
compresses
on
her
swollen
face
and
shoulders
a
bruised
and
broken
thing
planning
hideous
reprisals
herman
made
no
inquiry
for
her
he
went
stolidly
about
the
day
work
carried
in
firewood
and
coal
from
the
shed
inspected
the
garden
with
a
view
to
early
planting
and
ate
hugely
of
the
dinner
in
the
afternoon
rudolph
came
where
anna
he
asked
briskly
she
is
in
her
room
she
is
not
if
rudolph
suspected
anything
it
was
only
that
anna
was
sulking
but
later
on
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
there
trouble
out
of
a
clear
sky
herman
said
she
has
had
a
anna
was
she
to
him
since
when
rudolph
asked
with
interest
i
know
nothing
she
has
not
given
it
to
me
she
has
been
buying
herself
a
so
rudolph
tone
was
wary
she
will
buy
herself
no
more
watches
said
herman
with
an
air
of
finality
rudolph
hesitated
the
organization
wanted
herman
he
had
had
great
influence
with
the
millworkers
through
him
many
things
would
be
possible
the
spencers
trusted
him
too
at
any
time
rudolph
knew
they
would
be
glad
to
reinstate
him
and
once
inside
the
plant
there
was
no
limit
to
the
mischief
he
could
do
but
herman
was
too
valuable
to
risk
suppose
he
was
told
now
about
graham
spencer
and
anna
and
beat
the
girl
and
was
jailed
for
it
besides
ugly
as
rudolph
suspicions
were
they
were
as
yet
only
suspicions
he
decided
to
wait
until
he
could
bring
herman
proof
of
graham
spencer
relations
with
anna
when
that
time
came
he
knew
herman
he
would
be
clay
for
the
potter
he
rudolph
intended
to
be
the
potter
katie
had
an
afternoon
off
that
sunday
when
she
came
back
that
night
herman
weary
from
the
late
hours
of
saturday
was
already
snoring
in
his
bed
anna
met
katie
at
her
door
and
drew
her
in
i
found
a
nice
room
katie
whispered
here
the
address
written
down
the
street
cars
go
past
it
three
dollars
a
week
are
you
ready
anna
was
ready
even
to
her
hat
over
it
she
placed
a
dark
veil
for
she
was
badly
disfigured
then
with
katie
crying
quietly
she
left
the
house
in
the
flare
from
the
spencer
furnaces
katie
watched
until
the
girl
reappeared
on
the
twisting
street
below
which
still
followed
the
old
path
that
path
where
herman
years
ago
had
climbed
through
the
first
spring
wild
flowers
to
the
cottage
on
the
hill
graham
was
uncomfortable
the
next
morning
on
his
way
to
the
mill
face
had
haunted
him
but
out
of
all
his
confusion
one
thing
stood
out
with
distinctness
if
he
was
to
be
allowed
to
marry
marion
he
must
have
no
other
entanglement
he
would
go
to
her
clean
and
clear
so
he
went
to
the
office
armed
toward
anna
with
a
hardness
he
was
far
from
feeling
poor
little
kid
he
reflected
on
the
way
down
rotten
luck
all
he
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
it
would
be
a
lasting
grief
he
knew
that
sort
of
girl
he
reflected
out
of
his
vast
experience
of
they
were
sentimental
but
they
loved
and
forgot
easily
he
hoped
she
would
forget
him
but
even
with
that
there
was
a
vague
resentment
that
she
should
do
so
she
marry
some
he
reflected
and
wear
a
boudoir
cap
and
have
a
lot
of
children
who
need
their
noses
but
he
was
uncomfortable
anna
was
not
in
her
office
her
coat
and
hat
were
not
there
he
was
surprised
somewhat
relieved
it
was
out
of
his
hands
then
she
had
gone
somewhere
else
to
work
well
she
was
a
good
stenographer
somebody
was
having
a
piece
of
luck
clayton
finding
him
sent
joey
over
to
help
him
pack
up
his
office
belongings
the
fittings
of
his
desk
his
personal
papers
the
japanese
prints
and
rugs
natalie
had
sent
after
her
single
visit
to
the
boy
new
working
quarters
and
when
graham
came
back
from
luncheon
joey
had
a
message
for
him
telephone
call
for
you
what
was
it
lady
called
up
from
a
pay
phone
she
left
her
number
and
said
joey
lowered
his
voice
confidentially
sounded
like
miss
klein
he
volunteered
he
was
extremely
resentful
when
graham
sent
him
away
on
an
errand
and
graham
himself
frowned
as
he
called
the
number
on
the
pad
it
was
like
a
girl
this
breaking
off
clean
and
then
telephoning
instead
of
letting
the
thing
go
once
and
for
all
but
his
face
changed
as
he
heard
brief
story
over
the
wire
of
course
i
come
he
said
i
pretty
busy
but
i
can
steal
a
do
you
worry
we
fix
it
up
some
he
was
more
concerned
than
deeply
anxious
when
he
rang
off
it
was
unfortunate
that
was
all
and
the
father
was
a
german
swine
and
ought
to
be
beaten
himself
to
think
that
his
christmas
gift
had
brought
her
to
such
a
pass
a
leather
strap
god
he
was
vaguely
uneasy
however
he
had
a
sense
of
a
situation
being
forced
on
him
he
knew
too
that
clayton
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
new
plant
but
anna
trouble
absurd
as
its
cause
seemed
to
him
was
his
responsibility
it
ceased
to
be
absurd
however
when
he
saw
her
discolored
features
it
would
be
some
time
before
she
could
even
look
for
another
situation
her
face
was
a
swollen
mask
and
since
such
attraction
as
she
had
had
for
him
had
been
due
to
a
sort
of
evanescent
prettiness
of
youth
he
felt
a
repulsion
that
he
tried
his
best
to
conceal
you
poor
little
thing
he
said
he
a
brute
i
like
he
clenched
his
fists
well
i
got
you
into
it
i
certainly
going
to
see
you
she
had
lowered
her
veil
quickly
and
he
felt
easier
the
telephone
booth
was
in
the
corner
of
a
quiet
hotel
and
they
were
alone
he
patted
her
shoulder
i
see
you
through
he
repeated
do
you
worry
about
anything
just
lie
see
me
through
how
i
can
give
you
money
that
the
least
i
can
do
until
you
are
able
to
work
and
as
she
drew
away
we
call
it
a
loan
if
that
makes
you
feel
better
you
have
anything
have
you
he
has
everything
i
i
never
had
a
penny
except
poor
little
girl
he
said
again
she
was
still
weak
he
saw
and
he
led
her
into
the
deserted
cafe
he
took
a
highball
himself
not
because
he
wanted
it
but
because
she
refused
to
drink
at
first
he
had
never
before
had
a
drink
in
the
morning
and
he
felt
a
warm
and
reckless
glow
to
his
very
bending
toward
her
while
the
waiter
back
was
turned
he
kissed
her
marred
and
swollen
cheek
to
think
i
have
brought
you
all
this
trouble
you
must
blame
i
do
but
i
make
it
up
to
you
anna
you
do
hate
me
for
it
do
you
hate
you
you
know
better
than
i
come
round
to
take
you
out
now
and
then
in
the
evenings
i
want
you
to
sit
alone
in
that
forsaken
and
he
drew
out
a
and
extracted
some
notes
do
be
silly
he
protested
as
she
drew
back
it
the
only
way
i
can
get
back
my
you
owe
it
to
me
to
let
me
do
she
was
not
hard
to
persuade
anything
was
better
than
going
back
to
the
cottage
on
the
hill
and
to
that
heavy
brooding
figure
and
the
strap
on
the
wall
but
the
taking
of
the
money
marked
a
new
epoch
in
the
infatuation
it
bought
her
she
did
not
know
it
nor
did
he
but
hitherto
she
had
been
her
own
earning
her
own
livelihood
what
she
gave
of
love
of
small
caresses
and
intimacies
had
been
free
gifts
from
that
time
she
was
his
creature
in
her
creed
which
was
the
creed
of
the
girls
on
the
hill
one
did
not
receive
without
giving
she
would
pay
him
back
but
all
that
she
had
to
give
was
herself
you
come
to
see
me
too
wo
you
the
tingling
was
very
noticeable
now
he
felt
warm
and
young
and
very
very
strong
of
course
i
come
to
see
you
he
said
recklessly
you
take
a
little
time
off
you
worked
hard
and
we
play
round
she
bent
down
unexpectedly
and
put
her
bruised
cheek
against
his
hand
as
it
lay
on
the
table
i
love
you
dreadfully
she
whispered
chapter

february
and
march
were
peaceful
months
on
the
surface
washington
was
taking
stock
quietly
of
national
resources
and
watching
for
next
move
the
winter
impasse
in
europe
gave
way
to
the
first
fighting
of
spring
raids
and
sorties
mostly
since
the
ground
was
still
too
heavy
for
the
advancement

the

clayton
was
uncomfortable
at
dinner
that
night
he
wondered
what
buckham
thought
of
them
sitting
there
around
the
opulent
table
in
that
luxurious
room
did
he
resent
it
after
dinner
he
asked
him
if
he
cared
to
take
a
few
days
off
but
the
old
butler
shook
his
head
i
glad
to
have
my
work
to
keep
me
busy
sir
he
said
and
anyhow
in
england
it
considered
best
to
go
on
quite
as
though
nothing
had
happened
it
better
for
the
troops
there
was
a
new
softness
and
tolerance
in
clayton
that
early
spring
he
had
mellowed
somehow
a
mellowing
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
new
prosperity
in
past
times
he
had
wondered
how
he
would
stand
financial
success
if
it
ever
came
he
had
felt
fairly
sure
he
could
stand
the
other
thing
but
success
now
he
found
that
it
only
increased
his
sense
of
responsibility
he
was
outside
of
the
war
situation
as
nearly
happy
as
he
had
been
in
years
natalie
petulant
moods
when
they
came
no
longer
annoyed
him
he
was
supported
had
he
only
known
it
by
the
strong
inner
life
he
was
living
a
life
that
centered
about
his
weekly
meetings
with
audrey
audrey
gave
him
courage
to
go
on
he
left
their
comradely
hours
together
better
and
stronger
all
the
week
centered
about
that
one
hour
out
of
seven
days
when
he
stood
on
her
or
lay
back
in
a
deep
chair
listening
or
talking
such
talk
as
natalie
might
have
heard
without
resentment
some
times
he
felt
that
that
one
hour
was
all
he
wanted
it
carried
so
far
helped
so
greatly
he
was
so
boyishly
content
in
it
and
then
she
would
make
a
gesture
or
there
would
be
for
a
second
a
deeper
note
in
her
voice
and
the
mad
instinct
to
catch
her
to
him
was
almost
overwhelming
some
times
he
wondered
if
she
were
not
very
lonely
not
knowing
that
she
too
lived
for
days
on
that
one
hour
she
was
not
going
out
because
of
chris
death
and
he
knew
there
were
long
hours
when
she
sat
alone
struggling
determinedly
with
the
socks
she
was
knitting
only
once
did
they
tread
on
dangerous
ground
and
that
was
on
her
birthday
he
stopped
in
a
jeweler
on
his
way
and
brought
her
a
black
pearl
on
a
thin
almost
invisible
chain
only
to
have
her
refuse
to
take
it
i
ca
clay
why
not
it
too
valuable
i
ca
take
valuable
presents
from
it
value
has
anything
to
do
with
i
not
wearing
jewelry
audrey
he
said
gravely
it
is
the
pearl
it
is
its
value
that
absurd
do
you
understand
that
i
would
like
to
think
that
you
have
something
i
have
given
you
when
she
sat
still
thinking
over
what
he
had
said
he
slipped
the
chain
around
her
neck
and
clasped
it
then
he
stooped
down
very
gravely
and
kissed
her
for
my
silent
partner
he
said
in
all
those
weeks
that
was
the
only
time
he
had
kissed
her
he
knew
quite
well
the
edge
of
the
gulf
they
stood
on
and
he
was
determined
not
to
put
the
burden
of
denial
on
her
he
felt
a
real
contempt
for
men
who
left
the
strength
of
refusal
to
a
woman
who
pleaded
knowing
that
the
woman
strength
would
save
them
from
themselves
and
that
if
she
weakened
the
responsibility
was
hers
so
he
fed
on
the
husks
of
love
and
was
if
not
happy
happier
graham
too
was
getting
on
better
for
one
thing
anna
klein
had
been
she
lay
in
her
frightened
at
every
step
on
the
stairs
and
slowly
recovered
from
a
low
fever
graham
had
not
seen
her
but
he
sent
her
money
for
a
doctor
for
medicines
for
her
room
rent
enclosed
in
brief
letters
purely
friendly
and
interested
but
she
kept
them
under
her
pillow
and
devoured
them
with
feverish
eyes
but
something
had
gone
out
of
life
for
graham
not
anna
natalie
watching
him
closely
wondered
what
it
was
he
had
been
strange
and
distant
with
her
ever
since
that
tall
boy
in
kilts
had
been
there
he
was
studiously
polite
and
attentive
to
her
rose
when
she
entered
a
room
and
remained
standing
until
she
was
seated
brought
her
the
book
she
had
forgotten
lighted
her
occasional
cigaret
kissed
her
morning
and
evening
but
he
no
longer
came
into
her
for
that
hour
before
dinner
when
natalie
in
and
slippers
had
closed
the
door
to
clayton
room
and
had
kept
him
for
herself
she
was
jealous
of
clayton
those
days
some
times
she
found
the
eyes
fixed
on
his
father
with
admiration
and
something
more
she
was
jealous
of
the
things
they
had
in
common
of
the
days
at
the
mill
of
the
bits
of
discussion
after
dinner
when
clayton
sat
back
with
his
cigar
and
graham
voiced
as
new
discoveries
things
about
the
work
that
clayton
had
realized
for
years
he
always
listened
gravely
with
no
hint
of
patronage
but
natalie
would
break
in
now
and
then
impatient
of
a
conversation
that
excluded
her
your
father
knows
all
these
things
graham
she
said
once
you
talk
as
though
you
just
discovered
the
mill
like
columbus
discovering
not
at
all
clayton
said
hastily
he
has
a
new
viewpoint
i
am
greatly
interested
go
on
but
the
boy
enthusiasm
had
died
he
grew
apologetic
and
clayton
felt
a
resentment
that
was
close
to
despair
the
second
of
april
fell
on
a
saturday
congress
having
ended
the
session
the
fourth
of
march
had
been
hastily
reconvened
and
on
the
evening
of
that
day
saturday
at
half
past
eight
the
president
went
before
the
two
houses
in
joint
session
much
to
clayton
disgust
he
found
on
returning
home
that
they
were
dining
out
only
at
the
mackenzies
it
not
a
party
natalie
said
as
usual
she
was
before
the
and
she
spoke
to
his
reflection
in
the
mirror
i
should
think
you
could
do
that
without
looking
like
a
goodness
knows
we
been
quiet
enough
this
you
know
congress
has
been
i
do
know
why
that
should
it
rather
a
serious
he
tried
very
hard
to
speak
pleasantly
her
engrossment
in
her
own
reflection
irritated
him
so
he
did
not
look
at
her
but
of
course
i
every
time
is
a
serious
time
with
you
lately
she
flung
after
him
her
tone
was
not
disagreeable
she
was
merely
restating
an
old
grievance
a
few
moments
later
he
heard
her
calling
through
the
open
door
i
got
some
wonderful
old
rugs
yes
you
scream
when
you
pay
for
i
lost
my
voice
screaming
my
you
love
these
they
have
the
softest
colors
dead
rose
and
faded
blue
and
old
copper
i
very
glad
you
she
was
in
high
good
humor
when
they
started
clayton
trying
to
meet
her
conversational
demands
found
himself
wondering
if
the
significance
of
what
was
to
happen
in
washington
that
night
had
struck
home
to
her
if
it
had
and
she
could
still
be
cheerful
then
it
was
because
she
had
forced
a
promise
from
graham
he
made
his
decision
then
to
force
her
to
release
the
boy
from
any
promise
to
allow
him
his
own
choice
but
he
felt
with
increasing
anxiety
that
some
of
natalie
weakness
of
character
had
descended
to
graham
that
in
him
as
in
natalie
perhaps
obstinacy
was
what
he
hoped
was
strength
he
wondered
listening
to
her
what
it
would
be
to
have
beside
him
that
night
some
strong
and
quiet
woman
to
whom
he
could
carry
his
problems
his
perplexities
some
one
to
sit
hand
in
his
and
set
him
right
as
such
a
woman
could
on
many
things
and
for
a
moment
he
pictured
audrey
audrey
his
wife
driving
with
him
in
their
car
to
whatever
the
evening
might
hold
and
after
it
was
all
over
going
back
with
her
away
from
all
the
chatter
that
meant
so
little
to
the
home
that
shut
them
in
together
he
was
very
gentle
to
natalie
that
night
natalie
had
been
right
it
was
a
small
and
informal
group
gathered
together
hastily
to
discuss
the
emergency
only
denis
nolan
the
mackenzies
clayton
and
natalie
and
audrey
we
brought
her
out
of
her
shell
said
terry
genially
because
the
country
is
going
to
make
history
the
sort
of
history
audrey
has
been
shouting
for
for
the
little
party
was
very
grave
yet
of
them
all
only
the
spencers
would
be
directly
affected
the
mackenzies
had
no
children
button
my
secretary
terry
announced
is
in
washington
he
is
to
call
me
here
when
the
message
is
is
it
possible
said
natalie
recalling
a
headline
from
the
evening
paper
that
the
house
may
cause
an
indefinite
delay
and
as
usual
clayton
wondered
at
the
adroitness
with
which
in
the
talk
that
followed
she
escaped
detection
they
sat
long
at
the
table
rather
as
though
they
clung
together
and
nolan
insisted
on
figuring
the
cost
of
war
in
money
queer
thing
he
said
in
ancient
times
the
cost
of
war
fell
almost
entirely
on
the
poor
but
it
the
rich
who
will
pay
for
this
war
all
taxation
is
directed
primarily
against
the
the
poor
pay
in
blood
said
audrey
rather
sharply
they
give
their
lives
and
that
is
all
they
rich
and
poor
are
going
to
do
that
now
old
terry
broke
in
fight
against
it
all
you
like
you
members
of
the
privileged
class
the
draft
is
coming
this
is
every
man
but
clayton
spencer
was
watching
natalie
she
had
paled
and
was
fingering
her
absently
behind
her
lowered
eyelids
he
surmised
that
again
she
was
planning
but
what
then
it
came
to
him
like
a
flash
old
terry
had
said
the
draft
would
exempt
married
men
she
meant
to
marry
graham
to
a
girl
she
detested
to
save
him
from
danger
through
it
all
however
and
in
spite
of
his
anger
and
apprehension
he
was
sorry
for
her
sorry
for
her
craven
spirit
sorry
even
with
an
understanding
that
came
from
his
own
fears
sorry
for
her
that
she
had
remained
an
essential
child
in
a
time
that
would
tax
the
utmost
maturity
she
was
a
child
even
her
selfishness
was
the
selfishness
of
a
spoiled
child
she
craved
things
and
the
spirit
the
essence
of
life
escaped
her
and
beside
him
was
audrey
courageous
honest
natalie
and
audrey
some
time
during
the
evening
his
thoughts
took
this
form
that
there
were
two
sorts
of
people
in
the
world
those
who
seized
their
own
happiness
at
any
cost
and
those
who
saw
the
promised
land
from
a
far
hill
and
having
seen
it
turned
back
chapter
xxxi
graham
was
waiting
in
clayton
when
he
went
through
the
closed
door
they
could
hear
natalie
sleepy
and
rather
fretful
orders
to
her
maid
graham
rose
when
he
entered
and
threw
away
his
cigaret
i
guess
it
has
come
it
looks
like
a
great
wave
of
tenderness
for
the
boy
flooded
over
him
that
tall
straight
body
cast
in
his
own
mold
but
young
only
ready
to
live
that
was
to
be
cast
into
the
crucible
of
war
to
come
out
god
alone
knew
how
and
not
his
boy
only
but
millions
of
other
boys
yet
better
to
break
the
body
than
ruin
the
soul
how
is
mother
taking
it
natalie
voice
came
through
the
door
she
was
insisting
that
the
house
be
kept
quiet
the
next
morning
she
wanted
to
sleep
late
clayton
caught
the
boy
eyes
on
him
and
a
half
smile
on
his
face
does
she
know
she
is
taking
it
very
hard
is
she
then
his
voice
changed
i
wish
you
talk
to
her
father
she
well
she
got
me
you
see
i
promised
her
not
to
go
in
without
her
when
did
you
do
that
the
night
we
broke
with
germany
in
february
i
was
a
fool
but
she
was
crying
and
i
did
know
what
else
to
do
and
there
was
a
ring
of
desperation
in
his
voice
she
holding
me
to
it
i
been
to
her
over
and
over
and
you
want
to
go
want
to
go
i
got
to
he
broke
out
then
into
a
wild
appeal
he
wanted
to
get
away
he
was
making
a
mess
of
all
sorts
of
things
he
was
any
good
he
would
try
to
make
good
in
the
army
maybe
it
was
only
the
adventure
he
wanted
he
did
know
he
had
gone
into
that
he
hated
the
germans
he
wanted
one
chance
at
them
anyhow
they
were
beasts
clayton
listening
was
amazed
at
the
depth
of
feeling
and
anger
in
his
voice
i
talk
to
your
mother
he
agreed
when
the
boy
passion
had
spent
itself
i
think
she
will
release
but
he
was
less
certain
than
he
pretended
to
be
he
remembered
natalie
drooping
eyelids
that
night
at
dinner
she
might
absolve
him
from
the
promise
but
there
were
other
ways
of
holding
him
back
than
promises
perhaps
we
would
better
go
into
the
situation
thoroughly
he
suggested
i
have
rather
understood
lately
that
you
what
about
marion
hayden
graham
i
engaged
to
there
was
rather
a
long
pause
clayton
face
was
expressionless
since
when
last
fall
does
your
mother
know
i
told
her
he
looked
up
quickly
i
did
tell
you
i
knew
you
disliked
her
and
mother
said
he
checked
himself
marion
wanted
to
wait
she
wanted
to
be
welcome
when
she
came
into
the
i
do
so
much
dislike
her
as
i
disapprove
of
that
rather
worse
is
it
clayton
was
tired
his
very
spirit
was
tired
he
sat
down
in
his
big
chair
by
the
fire
she
is
older
than
you
are
you
i
do
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
it
in
clayton
defense
was
his
own
situation
he
did
not
want
the
boy
to
repeat
his
mistakes
to
marry
the
wrong
woman
and
then
find
too
late
the
right
one
during
the
impassioned
appeal
that
followed
he
was
doggedly
determined
to
prevent
that
perhaps
he
lost
the
urgency
in
the
boy
voice
perhaps
in
his
new
conviction
that
the
passions
of
the
forties
were
the
only
real
ones
he
took
too
little
count
of
the
urge
of
youth
he
roused
himself
you
think
you
are
really
in
love
with
her
i
want
her
i
know
that
different
that
you
are
too
young
to
know
what
you
i
ought
to
be
married
it
would
settle
me
i
sick
of
batting
you
want
to
marry
before
you
enter
the
army
do
you
think
for
a
moment
that
your
wife
will
be
willing
to
let
you
go
graham
straightened
himself
she
would
have
to
let
me
and
in
sheer
despair
clayton
played
his
last
card
played
it
and
regretted
it
bitterly
a
moment
later
we
must
get
this
straight
graham
it
not
a
question
of
your
entering
the
army
or
not
doing
it
it
a
question
of
your
happiness
marriage
is
a
matter
of
a
it
got
to
be
based
on
something
more
than
he
hesitated
and
your
mother
please
go
you
have
just
said
that
your
mother
does
not
want
you
to
go
into
the
army
has
it
occurred
to
you
she
would
even
see
you
married
to
a
girl
she
detests
to
keep
you
at
home
graham
face
hardened
so
he
said
heavily
marion
wants
me
for
the
money
she
thinks
going
to
have
and
mother
wants
me
to
marry
to
keep
me
safe
by
god
it
a
dirty
world
is
it
suddenly
he
was
gone
and
clayton
following
uneasily
to
the
doorway
heard
a
slam
below
when
some
hours
later
graham
had
not
come
back
he
fell
into
the
heavy
sleep
that
follows
anxiety
and
brings
no
rest
in
the
morning
he
found
that
graham
had
gone
back
to
the
garage
and
taken
his
car
and
that
he
had
not
returned
afterward
clayton
was
to
look
back
and
to
remember
with
surprise
how
completely
the
war
crisis
had
found
him
absorbed
in
his
own
small
group
but
perhaps
in
the
back
of
every
man
mind
war
was
always
first
of
all
a
thing
of
his
own
human
contacts
it
was
only
when
those
were
cleared
up
that
he
saw
the
bigger
problem
the
smaller
questions
loomed
so
close
as
to
obscure
the
larger
vision
he
went
out
into
the
country
the
next
day
a
cold
sunday
going
afoot
his
head
down
against
the
wind
and
walked
for
miles
he
looked
haggard
and
tired
when
he
came
back
but
his
quiet
face
held
a
new
resolve
war
had
come
at
last
he
would
put
behind
him
the
selfish
craving
for
happiness
forget
himself
he
would
not
make
money
out
of
the
necessity
he
would
put
audrey
out
of
his
mind
if
not
out
of
his
heart
he
would
try
to
rebuild
his
house
of
life
along
new
and
better
lines
perhaps
he
could
bring
natalie
to
see
things
as
he
saw
them
as
they
were
not
as
she
wanted
them
to
be
some
times
it
took
great
crises
to
bring
out
women
did
it
often
urgent
need
did
it
too
but
after
all
the
real
test
was
war
the
big
woman
met
it
squarely
took
her
part
of
the
burden
the
small
woman
weakened
went
down
under
it
found
it
a
grievance
rather
than
a
grief
he
did
not
notice
graham
car
when
it
passed
him
outside
the
city
limits
or
see
anna
klein
startled
eyes
as
it
flashed
by
graham
did
not
come
in
until
evening
at
ten
clayton
found
the
second
man
carrying
a
tray
containing
whisky
and
soda
and
before
he
slept
he
heard
a
tap
at
graham
door
across
the
hall
and
surmised
that
he
had
rung
for
another
later
still
he
heard
natalie
cross
the
hall
and
rather
loud
and
angry
voices
he
considered
ironically
that
a
day
which
had
found
a
part
of
the
nation
on
its
knees
found
in
his
own
house
only
dissension
and
bitterness
in
the
morning
at
the
office
joey
announced
a
soldier
to
see
him
and
added
with
his
customary
nonchalance
we
be
having
a
lot
of
them
around
now
i
clayton
glancing
up
from
the
visitor
slip
in
his
hand
surprised
something
wistful
in
the
boy
eyes
want
to
go
do
you
give
my
neck
to
go
he
always
added
the
sir
when
he
remembered
it
with
the
air
of
throwing
a
sop
to
a
convention
he
despised
you
may
yet
you
know
this
thing
is
going
to
last
a
while
send
him
in
he
had
grown
attached
to
this
lad
of
the
streets
he
found
in
his
loyalty
a
thing
he
could
not
buy
jackson
was
his
caller
clayton
who
had
been
rather
more
familiar
with
his
back
in
its
gray
livery
than
with
any
other
aspect
of
him
found
him
strange
and
impressive
in
khaki
i
sorry
i
could
get
here
sooner
spencer
he
explained
been
down
on
the
border
yuma
i
just
got
a
short
leave
and
came
back
to
see
my
he
stood
very
erect
a
bronzed
and
military
figure
suddenly
it
seemed
strange
to
clayton
spencer
that
this
man
before
him
had
only
a
few
months
before
opened
his
automobile
door
for
him
and
stood
waiting
with
a
rug
to
spread
over
his
knees
he
got
up
and
shook
hands
you
look
like
a
different
man
well
at
least
i
feel
like
a
sit
down
he
said
and
again
it
occurred
to
him
that
never
before
had
he
asked
jackson
to
sit
down
in
his
presence
it
was
wrong
somehow
the
whole
class
system
was
absurd
maybe
war
would
change
that
too
it
was
doing
many
queer
things
already
he
had
sent
for
jackson
but
he
did
not
at
once
approach
the
reason
he
sat
back
while
jackson
talked
of
the
border
and
joey
slipped
in
and
pretended
to
sharpen
lead
pencils
clayton
eyes
wandered
to
the
window
outside
in
the
yard
were
other
men
now
employees
of
his
who
would
soon
be
in
khaki
out
of
every
group
there
in
a
short
time
some
would
be
gone
and
of
those
who
would
go
a
certain
number
would
never
come
back
that
was
what
war
was
one
day
a
group
of
men
laboring
with
their
hands
or
their
brains
that
some
little
home
might
live
that
they
might
go
back
at
evening
to
that
home
and
there
rest
for
the
next
day
toil
and
the
next
gone
every
man
out
there
in
the
yard
was
loved
by
some
one
to
a
certain
number
of
them
this
day
meant
death
or
wounding
it
meant
separation
and
suffering
and
struggle
and
all
over
the
country
there
were
such
groups
the
roar
of
the
plant
came
in
through
the
open
window
a
freight
car
was
being
loaded
with
finished
shells
as
fast
as
it
was
filled
another
car
was
shunted
along
the
spur
to
take
its
place
over
in
germany
in
hundreds
of
similar
plants
similar
shells
were
being
hurried
to
the
battle
line
to
be
hurled
against
the
new
army
that
was
soon
to
cross
the
seas
all
those
men
and
back
of
every
man
a
woman
jackson
had
stopped
joey
was
regarding
him
with
stealthy
admiration
and
holding
his
breast
bone
very
high
already
in
his
mind
joey
was
a
soldier
you
did
not
say
in
your
note
why
you
wanted
to
see
me
he
roused
himself
with
a
visible
effort
i
sent
for
you
yes
he
said
i
sent
i
tell
you
why
i
sent
for
you
jackson
i
been
meaning
to
do
it
for
several
weeks
now
that
this
has
come
i
more
than
glad
i
did
so
you
ca
keep
your
family
on
what
you
are
getting
that
my
wife
is
going
to
help
me
sir
the
boy
will
soon
be
weaned
then
she
intends
to
get
a
position
she
was
a
milliner
when
we
were
but
great
scott
she
ought
not
to
leave
a
child
as
young
as
jackson
smiled
she
going
to
fix
that
all
right
she
wants
to
do
it
and
we
all
right
so
far
i
had
saved
a
then
there
were
women
like
that
women
who
would
not
only
let
their
men
go
to
war
but
who
would
leave
their
homes
and
enter
the
struggle
for
bread
to
help
them
do
it
she
says
it
the
right
thing
volunteered
jackson
proudly
women
who
felt
that
a
man
going
into
the
service
was
a
right
thing
women
who
saw
war
as
a
duty
to
be
done
not
a
wild
adventure
for
the
adventurous
you
ought
to
be
very
proud
of
her
he
said
slowly
there
are
not
many
like
well
jackson
said
apologetically
they
come
round
sir
some
of
them
kind
of
hate
the
idea
just
at
first
but
i
look
to
see
a
good
many
doing
what
my
wife
clayton
wondered
grimly
what
jackson
would
think
if
he
knew
that
at
that
moment
he
was
passionately
envious
of
him
of
his
uniform
of
the
youth
that
permitted
him
to
wear
that
uniform
of
his
bronzed
skin
of
his
wife
of
his
pride
in
that
wife
you
a
lucky
chap
jackson
he
said
i
sent
for
you
because
i
wanted
to
say
that
as
long
as
you
are
in
the
national
service
i
shall
feel
that
you
are
on
a
vacation
he
smiled
at
the
word
on
pay
under
those
circumstances
i
owe
you
quite
a
little
jackson
was
too
overwhelmed
to
reply
at
once
as
a
matter
of
fad
clayton
went
on
it
a
national
move
in
a
way
you
do
owe
any
gratitude
we
need
our
babies
you
see
more
than
we
do
hats
if
this
war
goes
on
we
shall
need
a
good
many
boy
and
his
own
words
suddenly
crystallized
the
terror
that
was
in
him
it
was
the
boys
who
would
go
boys
who
whistled
in
the
morning
boys
who
dreamed
in
the
spring
long
dreams
of
romance
and
of
love
boys
not
men
like
himself
with
their
hopes
and
dreams
behind
them
not
men
who
had
lived
enough
to
know
that
only
their
early
dreams
were
real
not
men
who
having
lived
knew
the
vast
disillusion
of
living
and
were
ready
to
die
it
was
only
after
jackson
had
gone
that
he
saw
the
fallacy
of
his
own
reasoning
if
to
live
were
disappointment
then
to
die
still
dreaming
the
great
dream
was
not
wholly
evil
he
found
himself
saying
to
earn
some
honorable
advancement
for
one
deep
down
in
him
overlaid
with
years
of
worldliness
there
was
a
belief
in
a
life
after
death
he
looked
out
the
window
at
the
little
changing
group
in
each
man
out
there
there
was
something
that
would
live
on
after
he
had
shed
that
sweating
often
dirty
always
weary
sometimes
malformed
shell
that
was
the
body
and
then
the
thing
that
would
count
would
be
not
how
he
had
lived
but
what
he
had
done
this
war
was
a
big
thing
it
was
the
biggest
thing
in
all
the
history
of
the
world
there
might
be
perhaps
some
special
heaven
for
those
who
had
given
themselves
to
it
some
particular
honorable
advancement
for
their
souls
already
he
saw
jackson
as
one
apart
a
man
dedicated
then
he
knew
that
all
his
thinking
was
really
centered
about
his
boy
he
wanted
graham
to
go
but
in
giving
him
he
was
giving
him
to
the
chance
of
death
then
he
must
hold
to
his
belief
in
eternity
he
must
feel
that
or
the
thing
would
be
unbearable
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
gave
conscious
thought
to
natalie
religious
belief
she
believed
in
those
things
she
must
she
sat
devoutly
through
the
long
service
she
slipped
with
a
little
rustle
of
soft
silk
so
easily
to
her
knees
perhaps
if
he
went
to
her
with
that
chapter
xxxii
for
a
week
after
anna
escape
herman
klein
had
sat
alone
and
brooded
entirely
alone
now
for
following
a
stormy
scene
on
his
discovery
of
anna
disappearance
katie
had
gone
too
i
do
know
where
she
is
she
had
said
angrily
and
if
i
did
know
i
would
tell
you
if
i
was
her
i
have
the
law
on
you
do
you
look
at
that
strap
you
lay
a
hand
on
me
and
i
kill
you
if
you
think
afraid
of
you
you
can
think
she
is
my
daughter
and
not
yet
of
age
herman
said
heavily
you
tell
her
for
me
that
she
comes
back
or
i
go
and
bring
yah
katie
jeered
you
try
it
she
got
marks
on
her
that
jail
and
on
his
failure
to
reply
her
courage
mounted
this
germany
you
know
they
know
how
to
treat
women
over
here
and
you
ask
me
her
voice
rose
and
i
just
say
that
there
queer
comings
and
goings
here
with
that
rudolph
i
heard
him
say
some
things
lock
him
up
good
and
for
all
his
rage
teutonic
caution
warned
him
not
to
lay
hands
on
the
girl
but
his
anger
against
her
almost
strangled
him
indeed
when
she
came
down
stairs
dragging
her
heavy
suitcase
he
took
a
step
or
two
toward
her
with
his
fists
clenched
she
stopped
terrified
you
old
bully
she
said
between
white
lips
you
touch
me
and
scream
till
i
bring
in
every
neighbor
in
the
block
there
a
good
outside
that
just
waiting
for
your
sort
of
he
had
refused
to
pay
her
for
the
last
week
also
but
that
she
knew
well
enough
was
because
he
was
out
of
money
as
fast
as
anna
salary
had
come
in
he
had
taken
out
of
it
the
small
allowance
that
was
to
cover
the
week
expenses
and
had
banked
the
remainder
but
anna
had
carried
her
last
pay
envelope
away
with
her
and
added
to
his
anger
at
her
going
was
his
fear
that
he
would
have
to
draw
on
his
savings
with
katie
gone
he
set
heavily
about
preparing
his
sunday
dinner
long
years
of
service
done
for
him
however
had
made
him
clumsy
he
cooked
a
wretched
meal
and
then
leaving
the
dishes
as
they
were
he
sat
by
the
fire
and
brooded
when
rudolph
came
in
later
he
found
him
there
in
his
a
morose
and
untidy
figure
rudolph
reception
of
the
news
roused
him
however
he
looked
up
after
the
telling
to
find
the
younger
man
standing
over
him
and
staring
down
at
him
with
eyes
you
beat
her
he
was
saying
what
with
what
does
that
matter
she
had
bought
herself
a
watch
what
did
you
beat
her
with
rudolph
was
licking
his
lips
receiving
no
reply
he
called
katie
katie
has
maybe
you
beat
her
she
was
my
no
by
god
you
would
dare
to
touch
her
she
did
belong
to
you
you
get
out
said
herman
somberly
he
stood
up
menacingly
you
go
rudolph
hesitated
then
he
laughed
all
right
old
top
he
said
in
a
conciliatory
tone
no
offense
meant
i
lost
my
he
picked
up
the
empty
and
went
out
into
the
shed
where
the
coal
was
kept
he
needed
a
minute
to
think
besides
he
always
brought
in
coal
when
he
was
there
in
the
shed
however
he
put
down
the
scuttle
and
stood
still
the
old
devil
he
muttered
but
his
rage
for
anna
was
followed
by
rage
against
her
where
was
she
did
graham
spencer
know
where
she
was
and
if
he
did
what
then
were
they
at
that
moment
somewhere
together
hidden
away
the
two
of
them
the
conviction
that
they
were
together
grew
on
him
and
with
it
a
frenzy
that
was
almost
madness
he
left
the
coal
scuttle
in
the
shed
and
went
out
into
the
air
for
a
half
hour
he
stood
there
looking
down
toward
the
spencer
furnace
sending
up
now
red
now
violet
bursts
of
flame
he
was
angry
enough
jealous
enough
but
he
was
quick
too
to
see
that
that
particular
lump
of
potters
clay
which
was
herman
klein
was
ready
for
the
wheel
even
while
he
was
cursing
the
girl
his
cunning
mind
was
already
plotting
revenge
for
the
spencers
among
his
fellows
for
himself
his
inordinate
conceit
wounded
by
defection
found
comfort
in
the
early
prospect
of
putting
over
a
big
thing
he
carried
the
coal
in
to
find
herman
gloomily
clearing
his
untidy
table
for
a
moment
they
worked
in
silence
rudolph
at
the
stove
herman
at
the
sink
then
rudolph
washed
his
hands
under
the
faucet
and
faced
the
older
man
how
do
you
know
she
bought
herself
that
watch
he
demanded
herman
eyed
him
perhaps
you
gave
it
to
her
something
like
suspicion
of
rudolph
crept
into
his
eyes
me
a
watch
how
do
you
know
it
cost
a
hundred
dollars
i
saw
it
she
tried
that
story
on
me
too
but
i
was
too
smart
for
her
i
went
to
the
store
and
asked
a
hundred
bucks
herman
lips
drew
back
over
his
teeth
you
knew
it
eh
and
you
did
not
tell
me
it
was
my
funeral
said
rudolph
coolly
if
you
wanted
to
believe
she
bought
it
herself
if
she
bought
it
herself
rudolph
shoulder
was
caught
in
an
iron
grip
you
will
tell
me
what
you
well
i
ask
you
do
you
think
she
spend
that
much
on
a
watch
anyhow
the
installment
story
does
go
that
place
does
sell
on
who
is
there
would
buy
her
such
a
watch
herman
voice
was
thick
how
about
graham
spencer
she
been
pretty
thick
with
how
you
mean
thick
rudolph
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
do
mean
anything
but
he
taken
her
out
in
his
car
and
the
spencers
think
there
nothing
ca
be
bought
with
herman
put
down
the
and
commenced
to
draw
down
his
shirt
sleeves
where
you
going
rudolph
demanded
uneasily
i
go
to
the
spencers
listen
rudolph
said
excitedly
do
you
do
it
not
yet
you
got
to
get
him
first
we
do
know
anything
we
do
even
know
he
gave
her
that
watch
we
got
to
find
her
do
you
see
and
then
we
got
to
learn
if
he
going
there
wherever
she
i
shall
bring
her
back
herman
said
stubbornly
i
shall
bring
her
back
and
i
shall
kill
and
get
strung
up
yourself
now
listen
he
argued
you
leave
this
to
me

her
i
got
a
friend
a
city
detective
and
he
help
me
see
we
get
her
back
all
right
only
you
got
to
keep
your
hands
off
her
it
the
spencers
that
have
got
to
herman
went
back
to
the
sink
slowly
that
is
right
it
is
the
spencers
he
muttered
rudolph
went
out
late
in
the
evening
he
came
back
with
the
news
that
the
search
was
on
and
knowing
herman
pride
he
assured
him
that
the
hill
need
never
learn
of
anna
flight
and
if
any
inquiries
came
he
advised
him
to
say
the
girl
was
sick
in
rudolph
twisted
mind
it
was
not
so
much
anna
delinquency
that
enraged
him
the
hill
had
its
own
ideas
of
morality
but
he
was
fiercely
jealous
with
that
which
was
the
fundamental
actuating
motive
of
his
life
he
never
for
a
moment
doubted
that
she
had
gone
to
graham
and
sitting
by
the
fire
in
the
little
house
old
herman
untidy
head
shrunk
on
his
shoulders
rudolph
almost
forgot
anna
in
plotting
to
use
this
new
pawn
across
the
hearth
from
him
in
his
game
of
destruction
by
the
end
of
the
week
however
there
was
no
news
of
anna
she
had
not
returned
to
the
mill
rudolph
friend
on
the
detective
force
had
found
no
clew
and
old
herman
had
advanced
from
brooding
by
the
fire
to
long
and
furious
wanderings
about
the
city
streets
he
felt
no
remorse
only
a
growing
and
alarming
fury
he
returned
at
night
to
his
cold
and
unkempt
house
to
cook
himself
a
frugal
and
wretched
meal
his
money
had
run
very
low
and
with
true
german
stubbornness
he
refused
to
draw
any
from
the
savings
bank
rudolph
was
very
busy
there
were
meetings
always
and
to
the
little
inner
circle
that
met
behind
gus
barroom
one
night
later
in
march
he
divulged
the
plan
for
the
destruction
of
the
new
spencer
munition
plant
but
will
they
take
him
back
one
of
the
men
asked
he
was
of
better
class
than
the
rest
with
a
military
bearing
and
a
heavy
german
accent
for
all
his
careful
english
will
a
dog
snatch
at
a
bone
countered
rudolph
take
him
back
they
be
crazy
about
he
has
been
there
a
long
time
he
may
at
the
last
but
rudolph
only
laughed
and
drank
more
whisky
of
the
german
providing
he
wo
weaken
he
said
give
me
a
few
days
more
to
find
the
girl
and
all
hell
wo
hold
on
the
sunday
morning
after
the
president
had
been
before
congress
he
found
herman
dressed
for
church
but
sitting
by
the
fire
all
around
him
lay
the
sunday
paper
and
he
barely
raised
his
head
when
rudolph
entered
well
it
here
said
rudolph
it
has
come
wall
street
will
be
opening
champagne
herman
said
nothing
but
later
on
he
opened
up
the
fountain
of
rage
in
his
heart
it
was
wrong
all
wrong
we
had
no
quarrel
with
germany
it
was
the
capitalists
and
politicians
who
had
done
it
and
above
all
england
he
went
far
he
blamed
america
and
americans
for
his
loss
of
work
for
anna
disappearance
he
searched
his
mind
for
grievances
and
found
them
in
the
ore
dust
on
the
hill
which
killed
his
garden
in
the
inefficiency
of
the
police
who
could
not
find
anna
in
the
very
attitude
of
clayton
spencer
toward
his
resignation
and
on
this
smoldering
fire
rudolph
piled
fuel
not
that
he
said
a
great
deal
he
worked
around
the
cottage
washed
dishes
threw
pails
of
water
on
the
dirty
porches
swept
the
floor
carried
in
coal
and
wood
and
gradually
he
began
to
play
on
the
older
man
vanity
he
had
had
great
influence
with
the
millworkers
no
one
man
had
ever
had
so
much
old
herman
sat
up
and
listened
sourly
but
after
a
time
he
got
up
and
pouring
some
water
out
of
the
kettle
proceeded
to
shave
himself
and
rudolph
talked
on
if
now
he
were
to
go
back
and
it
were
to
the
advantage
of
the
fatherland
and
of
the
workers
of
the
world
to
hamper
the
industry
who
so
able
to
do
it
as
herman
hamper
how
herman
asked
suspiciously
holding
his
razor
aloft
he
had
a
great
fear
of
the
law
rudolph
him
cunning
eyes
averted
well
a
strike
he
suggested
the
men
listen
to
you
god
knows
they
got
a
right
to
i
shall
not
go
back
said
herman
stolidly
and
finished
his
shaving
but
rudolph
was
satisfied
he
left
herman
sitting
again
by
the
fire
but
his
eyes
were
no
longer
brooding
he
was
thinking
watching
the
smoke
curl
up
from
the
german
pipe
which
he
had
brought
from
the
fatherland
and
which
he
used
only
on
special
occasions
chapter
xxxiii
the
declaration
of
war
found
graham
desperately
unhappy
natalie
held
him
rigidly
to
his
promise
but
it
is
doubtful
if
natalie
alone
could
have
kept
him
out
of
the
army
marion
was
using
her
influence
too
she
held
him
by
alternating
between
almost
agreeing
to
runaway
marriage
and
threats
of
breaking
the
engagement
if
he
went
to
war
she
had
tacitly
agreed
to
play
natalie
game
and
she
was
doing
it
graham
did
not
analyze
his
own
misery
what
he
said
to
himself
was
that
he
was
making
a
mess
of
things
life
which
had
seemed
to
be
a
simple
thing
compounded
of
work
and
play
had
become
involved
difficult
and
wretched
some
times
he
watched
clayton
almost
with
envy
he
seemed
so
sure
of
himself
he
was
so
poised
so
calm
so
strong
and
he
wondered
if
there
had
been
a
tumultuous
youth
behind
the
quiet
of
his
maturity
he
compared
the
even
course
of
clayton
days
his
work
his
club
the
immaculate
orderliness
of
his
life
with
his
own
disordered
existence
he
was
hedged
about
with
women
wherever
he
turned
they
obtruded
themselves
he
made
plans
and
women
brushed
them
aside
he
tried
to
live
his
life
and
women
stepped
in
and
lived
it
for
him
his
mother
marion
anna
klein
even
delight
with
her
friendship
always
overclouded
with
disapproval
wherever
he
turned
a
woman
stood
in
the
way
yet
he
could
not
do
without
them
he
needed
them
even
while
he
resented
them
then
gradually
into
his
there
penetrated
a
conviction
that
all
was
not
well
between
his
father
and
his
mother
he
had
always
taken
them
for
granted
much
as
he
did
the
house
and
the
servants
in
his
brief
vacations
during
his
college
days
they
had
agreed
or
disagreed
amicably
enough
he
had
considered
in
those
days
that
life
was
a
very
simple
thing
people
married
and
lived
together
marriage
he
considered
was
rather
the
end
of
things
but
he
was
older
now
and
he
knew
that
marriage
was
a
beginning
and
not
an
end
it
did
not
change
people
fundamentally
it
only
changed
their
habits
his
discovery
that
his
father
and
mother
differed
about
the
war
was
the
first
of
other
discoveries
that
they
differed
about
him
that
they
differed
about
many
matters
that
indeed
they
had
no
common
ground
at
all
on
which
to
meet
between
them
although
graham
did
not
put
it
that
way
was
a
land
strewn
with
dead
happiness
lost
desires
and
the
wreckage
of
years
of
dissension
it
was
incredible
to
graham
that
he
should
ever
reach
the
forties
but
he
wondered
some
times
if
all
of
life
was
either
looking
forward
or
looking
back
and
it
seemed
to
him
rather
tragic
that
for
clayton
who
still
looked
like
a
boy
there
should
be
nothing
but
his
day
at
the
mill
his
silent
evening
at
home
or
some
stodgy
where
the
women
were
all
and
the
other
men
a
trifle
corpulent
for
the
first
time
he
was
beginning
to
think
of
clayton
as
a
man
rather
than
a
father
not
that
all
of
this
was
coherently
thought
out
it
was
a
series
of
impressions
outgrowth
of
his
own
beginning
development
and
of
his
own
uneasiness
he
wondered
too
about
rodney
page
he
seemed
to
be
always
around
underfoot
suave
fastidious
bowing
natalie
out
of
the
room
and
in
again
he
had
deplored
the
war
until
he
found
his
attitude
unfashionable
and
then
he
began
with
great
enthusiasm
to
arrange
pageants
for
red
cross
funds
and
even
to
make
little
speeches
graceful
and
artificial
patterned
on
his
best
manner
graham
was
certain
that
he
supported
his
mother
in
trying
to
keep
him
at
home
and
he
began
to
hate
him
with
a
healthy
young
hate
however
late
in
april
he
posed
in
one
of
the
pageants
rather
ungraciously
in
a
khaki
uniform
it
was
not
until
the
last
minute
that
he
knew
that
delight
haverford
was
to
be
the
nurse
bending
over
his
prostrate
figure
he
turned
rather
savage
rotten
nonsense
he
said
to
her
when
they
stood
waiting
to
be
posed
oh
i
do
know
they
rather
pretty
do
you
suppose
i
want
it
be
pretty
well
i
do
said
delight
calmly
it
fake
that
what
i
hate
if
you
were
really
a
nurse
and
was
really
in
uniform
but
this
parading
in
somebody
else
clothes
or
stuff
hired
for
the
occasion
it
delight
regarded
him
with
clear
appraising
eyes
why
do
you
get
a
uniform
of
your
own
then
she
inquired
she
smiled
a
little
he
never
knew
what
the
effort
cost
her
he
was
pale
and
angry
and
his
face
in
the
tableau
was
so
set
that
it
brought
a
round
of
applause
with
the
ringing
down
of
the
curtain
he
confronted
her
almost
menacingly
what
did
you
mean
by
that
he
demanded
we
hardly
got
into
this
thing
we
are
in
it
just
because
i
do
leap
into
the
first
recruiting
office
and
beg
them
to
take
me
what
right
have
you
got
to
call
me
a
slacker
but
i
heard
go
on
it
does
matter
what
i
heard
if
you
are
of
course
i
going
he
said
truculently
he
meant
it
too
he
would
get
anna
settled
somewhere
she
had
begun
to
mend
and
then
he
would
have
it
out
with
marion
and
his
mother
but
there
was
no
hurry
the
war
would
last
a
long
time
and
so
it
was
that
graham
spencer
joined
the
long
line
of
those
others
who
had
bought
a
piece
of
ground
or
five
yoke
of
oxen
or
had
married
a
wife
it
was
the
morning
after
the
pageant
that
clayton
going
with
him
in
the
car
voiced
his
expectation
that
the
government
would
take
over
their
foreign
contracts
and
his
feeling
that
in
that
case
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
profit
by
the
nation
necessities
what
do
you
mean
sir
i
mean
we
should
take
only
a
small
profit
a
banker
graham
had
been
fairly
stunned
and
had
sat
quiet
while
clayton
explained
his
attitude
there
were
times
when
big
profits
were
allowable
there
was
always
the
risk
to
invested
capital
to
consider
but
he
did
not
want
to
grow
fat
on
the
nation
misfortunes
italy
was
one
thing
this
was
different
but
we
are
just
getting
on
our
feet
think
it
over
said
clayton
this
is
going
to
be
a
long
war
and
an
expensive
one
we
do
particularly
want
to
profit
by
it
do
we
graham
flushed
he
felt
rather
small
and
cheap
but
with
that
there
was
a
growing
admiration
of
his
father
suddenly
he
saw
that
this
man
beside
him
was
a
big
man
one
to
be
proud
of
for
already
he
knew
the
cost
of
the
decision
he
sat
still
turning
this
new
angle
of
war
over
in
his
mind
i
like
to
see
some
of
your
directors
when
you
put
that
up
to
them
clayton
nodded
rather
grimly
he
did
not
anticipate
a
pleasant
hour
how
about
mother
i
think
we
may
take
it
for
granted
that
she
feels
as
we
graham
pondered
that
too
what
about
the
new
place
it
too
soon
to
discuss
that
we
are
obligated
to
do
a
certain
amount
of
course
it
would
be
wise
to
cut
where
we
graham
smiled
she
raise
the
deuce
of
a
row
was
his
comment
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
before
to
take
sides
between
his
father
and
his
mother
but
there
was
rising
in
him
a
new
and
ardent
partisanship
of
his
father
a
feeling
that
they
were
in
a
way
men
together
he
had
more
than
once
been
tempted
to
go
to
him
with
the
anna
klein
situation
he
would
have
probably
but
a
fellow
felt
an
awful
fool
going
to
somebody
and
telling
him
that
a
girl
was
in
love
with
him
and
what
the
dickens
was
he
to
do
about
it
he
wondered
too
if
anybody
would
believe
that
his
relationship
with
anna
was
straight
under
the
circumstances
for
weeks
now
he
had
been
sending
her
money
out
of
a
sheer
sense
of
responsibility
for
her
beating
and
her
illness
he
took
no
credit
for
altruism
he
knew
quite
well
the
possibilities
of
the
situation
he
made
no
promises
to
himself
but
such
attraction
as
anna
had
had
for
him
had
been
of
her
prettiness
and
their
propinquity
again
she
was
girl
and
that
was
all
and
the
attraction
was
very
faint
now
he
was
only
sorry
for
her
when
she
could
get
about
she
took
to
calling
him
up
daily
from
a
at
a
corner
and
once
he
met
her
after
dark
and
they
walked
a
few
blocks
together
she
was
still
weak
but
she
was
spiritualized
too
he
liked
her
a
great
deal
that
night
do
you
know
you
loaned
me
over
a
hundred
dollars
graham
she
asked
that
not
a
loan
i
owed
you
i
pay
it
back
i
going
to
start
to
look
for
work
and
it
wo
cost
me
much
to
if
you
send
it
back
i
buy
you
another
watch
and
tragic
as
the
subject
was
they
both
laughed
i
have
died
if
i
had
had
you
to
think
about
when
i
was
sick
graham
i
wanted
to
die
except
for
he
had
kissed
her
then
rather
because
he
knew
she
expected
him
to
when
they
got
back
to
the
house
she
said
you
would
care
to
come
up
i
do
think
i
had
better
the
landlady
does
object
there
is
any
parlor
all
the
girls
have
their
callers
in
their
i
have
to
go
out
he
said
evasively
i
come
some
other
as
he
started
away
he
glanced
back
at
her
she
was
standing
in
the
doorway
eying
him
wistfully
a
lonely
and
depressed
little
figure
he
was
tempted
to
throw
discretion
to
the
wind
and
go
back
but
he
did
not
on
the
day
when
clayton
had
broached
the
subject
of
offering
their
output
to
the
government
at
only
a
banker
profit
anna
called
him
up
at
his
new
office
in
the
munition
plant
he
was
rather
annoyed
his
new
secretary
was
sitting
across
the
desk
and
it
was
difficult
to
make
his
responses
noncommittal
graham
is
anybody
there
can
you
talk
not
very
then
listen
i
talk
i
want
to
see
i
busy
all
day
listen
graham
i
must
see
you
i
something
to
tell
all
right
go
it
about
rudolph
i
was
out
looking
for
a
position
yesterday
and
i
met
yes
he
looked
up
miss
peterson
was
absently
scribbling
on
the
cover
of
her
book
and
listening
intently
he
was
terrible
graham
he
accused
me
of
all
sorts
of
things
about
he
almost
groaned
aloud
over
the
predicament
he
was
in
it
began
to
look
serious
suppose
i
pick
you
up
and
we
have
dinner
somewhere
at
the
same
corner
he
was
very
irritable
all
morning
he
felt
as
though
a
net
was
closing
in
around
him
and
his
actual
innocence
made
him
the
more
miserable
miss
peterson
found
him
very
difficult
that
day
and
shed
tears
in
her
little
room
before
she
went
to
lunch
anna
herself
was
difficult
that
evening
her
landlady
son
had
given
up
a
good
job
and
enlisted
everybody
was
going
she
supposed
graham
would
go
next
and
she
be
left
alone
i
do
know
i
like
oh
you
go
all
right
and
you
forget
i
ever
she
made
an
effort
you
right
of
course
i
only
looking
ahead
if
anything
happens
to
you
i
kill
the
idea
interested
her
she
began
to
dramatize
herself
a
forlorn
figure
driven
from
home
and
deserted
by
her
lover
she
saw
herself
lying
in
the
cottage
stately
and
mysterious
while
the
hill
girls
went
in
and
out
and
whispered
i
kill
myself
she
repeated
nothing
will
happen
to
me
anna
i
do
know
why
i
care
so
i
nothing
to
that
not
if
you
cared
you
have
come
up
the
other
night
you
left
me
alone
in
that
lonesome
hole
it
hell
that
place
all
smells
and
whispering
and
now
listen
to
me
anna
you
tired
or
you
would
say
that
you
know
i
fond
of
you
but
i
got
you
into
trouble
enough
i
not
for
god
sake
do
tempt
me
she
looked
at
him
half
scornfully
tempt
you
then
she
gave
a
little
scream
graham
following
her
eyes
looked
through
the
window
near
them
rudolph
she
whimpered
and
began
to
weep
out
of
pure
terror
but
graham
saw
nobody
to
soothe
her
however
he
went
outside
and
looked
about
there
were
half
a
dozen
cars
a
group
of
chauffeurs
but
no
rudolph
he
went
hack
to
her
to
find
her
sitting
pale
and
tense
her
hands
clenched
together
they
pay
you
out
some
way
she
said
i
know
them
they
never
believe
the
truth
that
was
rudolph
all
right
he
think
we
living
together
he
never
believe
anything
do
you
think
he
followed
you
the
other
day
i
gave
him
the
shake
in
the
then
i
do
see
why
you
worrying
we
just
where
we
were
before
are
we
you
do
know
them
i
do
they
be
up
to
she
was
excited
and
anxious
and
with
the
cocktail
he
ordered
for
her
she
grew
reckless
i
just
hung
around
your
neck
like
a
stone
she
lamented
you
care
a
rap
for
me
i
know
it
you
just
sorry
for
her
eyes
filled
again
and
graham
rose
with
an
impatient
movement
let
get
out
of
this
he
said
roughly
the
whole
place
is
staring
at
but
on
the
road
the
fact
that
she
had
been
weeping
for
him
made
him
relent
he
put
an
arm
around
her
and
drew
her
to
him
do
cry
honey
he
said
it
makes
me
unhappy
to
see
you
he
kissed
her
and
they
clung
together
finding
a
little
comfort
in
the
contact
of
warm
young
bodies
he
went
up
to
her
room
that
night
he
was
more
anxious
as
to
rudolph
than
he
cared
to
admit
but
he
went
up
treading
softly
on
stairs
that
creaked
with
every
step
he
had
no
coherent
thoughts
he
wanted
companionship
rather
than
love
he
was
hungry
for
what
she
gave
him
the
touch
of
her
hands
about
his
neck
the
sense
of
his
manhood
that
shone
from
her
faithful
eyes
the
admiration
and
unstinting
love
she
offered
him
but
alone
in
the
little
room
he
had
a
reaction
not
the
less
keen
because
it
was
his
fastidious
rather
than
his
moral
sense
that
revolted
the
room
was
untidy
close
sordid
even
anna
youth
did
not
redeem
it
again
he
had
the
sense
when
he
had
closed
the
door
of
being
caught
in
a
trap
and
this
time
a
dirty
trap
when
she
had
taken
off
her
hat
and
held
up
her
face
to
be
kissed
he
knew
he
would
not
stay
it
awful
is
it
she
asked
following
his
eyes
it
does
look
like
you
that
i
hurried
out
it
not
so
bad
when
it
he
threw
up
the
window
and
stood
there
a
moment
the
spring
air
was
cool
and
clean
and
there
was
a
sound
of
tramping
feet
below
he
looked
down
the
railway
station
was
and
marching
toward
it
with
the
long
swing
of
regulars
a
company
of
soldiers
was
moving
rapidly
the
night
the
absence
of
drums
or
music
the
businesslike
rapidity
of
their
progress
held
him
there
looking
down
he
turned
around
anna
had
slipped
off
her
coat
and
had
opened
the
collar
of
her
blouse
her
neck
gleamed
white
and
young
she
smiled
at
him
i
guess
i
be
going
he
stammered
going
i
only
wanted
to
see
how
you
are
his
eyes
evaded
hers
see
you
again
in
a
day
or
two
i
he
could
not
tell
her
the
thoughts
that
were
surging
in
him
the
country
was
at
war
those
fellows
below
there
were
already
in
it
of
it
and
here
in
this
sordid
room
he
had
meant
to
take
her
not
because
he
loved
her
but
because
she
offered
herself
it
was
cheap
it
was
terrible
it
was
dirty
good
night
he
said
and
tried
to
kiss
her
but
she
turned
her
face
away
she
stood
listening
to
his
steps
on
the
stairs
as
he
went
down
steps
that
mingled
and
were
lost
in
the
steady
tramp
of
the
feet
in
the
street
below
chapter
xxxiv
with
his
many
new
problems
following
the
declaration
of
war
clayton
spencer
found
a
certain
peace
it
was
good
to
work
hard
it
was
good
to
fill
every
working
hour
and
to
drop
into
sleep
at
night
too
weary
for
consecutive
thought
yet
had
he
been
frank
with
himself
he
would
have
acknowledged
that
audrey
was
never
really
out
of
his
mind
back
of
his
every
decision
lay
his
desire
for
her
approval
he
did
not
make
them
with
her
consciously
in
his
mind
but
he
wanted
her
to
know
and
understand
in
his
determination
for
instance
to
offer
his
shells
to
the
government
at
a
nominal
profit
there
was
no
desire
to
win
her
approbation
it
was
rather
that
he
felt
her
behind
him
in
the
decision
he
shrank
from
telling
natalie
indeed
until
he
had
returned
from
washington
he
did
not
broach
the
subject
and
then
he
was
tired
and
rather
discouraged
and
as
a
result
almost
brutally
abrupt
coming
on
top
of
a
hard
fight
with
the
new
directorate
a
fight
which
he
had
finally
won
washington
was
disheartening
planning
enormously
for
the
future
it
seemed
to
have
no
vision
for
the
things
of
the
present
he
was
met
vaguely
put
off
questioned
he
waited
hours
as
patiently
as
he
could
to
find
that
no
man
seemed
to
have
power
to
act
or
to
know
what
powers
he
had
he
found
something
else
too
a
suspicion
of
him
of
his
motives
who
offered
something
for
nothing
must
be
actuated
by
some
deep
and
hidden
motive
he
found
his
plain
proposition
probed
and
searched
for
some
ulterior
purpose
behind
it
it
the
old
distrust
spencer
said
hutchinson
who
had
gone
with
him
to
furnish
figures
and
various
data
the
democrats
are
opposed
to
capital
they
afraid
of
it
and
the
army
thinks
all
civilians
are
on
the
make
which
is
pretty
nearly
he
saw
the
secretary
of
war
finally
and
came
away
feeling
better
he
had
found
there
an
understanding
that
a
man
may
even
should
make
sacrifices
for
his
country
during
war
but
although
he
carried
away
with
him
the
conviction
that
his
offer
would
ultimately
be
accepted
there
was
nothing
actually
accomplished
he
sent
hutchinson
back
and
waited
for
a
day
or
two
convinced
that
his
very
sincerity
must
bring
a
concrete
result
and
soon
then
lunching
alone
one
day
in
the
shoreham
he
saw
audrey
valentine
at
another
table
he
had
not
seen
her
for
weeks
and
he
had
an
odd
moment
of
breathlessness
when
his
eyes
fell
on
her
she
was
pale
and
thin
and
her
eyes
looked
very
tired
his
first
impulse
was
to
go
to
her
the
second
on
which
he
acted
was
to
watch
her
for
a
little
to
fill
his
eyes
for
the
long
months
of
emptiness
ahead
she
was
with
a
man
in
uniform
a
young
man
gay
and
smiling
he
was
paying
her
evident
court
in
a
debonair
fashion
bending
toward
her
across
the
table
suddenly
clayton
was
jealous
fiercely
jealous
the
jealousy
of
the
young
is
sad
enough
but
it
is
an
ephemeral
thing
life
calls
from
many
directions
there
is
always
the
future
and
the
things
of
the
future
and
behind
it
there
is
the
buoyancy
and
easy
forgetfulness
of
youth
but
the
jealousy
of
later
years
knows
no
such
relief
it
sees
time
flying
and
happiness
evading
it
it
has
not
the
easy
of
the
twenties
it
has
learned
too
that
happiness
is
a
rare
elusive
thing
to
be
held
and
nursed
and
clung
to
and
that
even
love
must
be
won
and
held
it
has
learned
that
love
must
be
free
but
its
instinct
is
to
hold
it
with
chains
he
suffered
acutely
and
was
ashamed
of
his
suffering
after
all
audrey
was
still
young
life
had
not
been
kind
to
her
and
she
should
be
allowed
to
have
such
happiness
as
she
could
he
could
offer
her
nothing
he
would
give
her
up
he
had
already
given
her
up
she
knew
it
then
she
saw
him
and
his
determination
died
under
the
light
that
came
in
her
eyes
give
her
up
how
could
he
give
her
up
when
she
was
everything
he
had
in
the
world
with
a
shock
he
recognized
in
the
thought
natalie
constant
repetition
as
to
graham
so
he
had
come
to
that
he
felt
audrey
eyes
on
him
but
he
did
not
go
to
her
he
signed
his
check
and
went
out
he
fully
meant
to
go
away
without
seeing
her
but
outside
he
hesitated
that
would
hurt
her
and
it
was
cowardly
when
a
few
moments
later
she
came
out
followed
by
the
officer
it
was
to
find
him
there
obviously
waiting
i
wondered
if
you
would
dare
to
run
away
she
said
this
is
captain
sloane
clay
and
he
knows
a
lot
about
close
inspection
showed
sloane
handsome
bronzed
and
with
a
soft
southern
voice
somewhat
like
audrey
and
it
developed
that
he
came
from
her
home
and
was
on
his
way
to
one
of
the
early
camps
he
obviously
intended
to
hold
on
to
audrey
and
clayton
left
them
there
with
the
feeling
that
audrey
eyes
were
following
him
wistful
and
full
of
trouble
he
had
not
even
asked
her
where
she
was
stopping
he
took
a
long
walk
that
afternoon
and
his
resolution
he
would
keep
away
from
her
it
might
hurt
her
at
first
but
she
was
young
she
would
forget
and
he
must
not
stand
in
her
way
having
done
which
he
returned
to
the
shoreham
and
spent
an
hour
in
a
telephone
booth
calling
hotels
systematically
and
inquiring
for
her
when
he
finally
located
her
his
voice
over
the
wire
startled
her
good
heavens
clay
she
said
are
you
angry
about
anything
of
course
not
i
just
wanted
to
i
am
leaving
and
i
saying
that
oh
she
waited
have
you
had
a
pleasant
afternoon
are
you
going
to
see
me
before
you
go
i
do
think
do
you
want
to
know
what
i
am
doing
in
washington
that
fairly
clear
is
it
you
are
being
rather
cruel
he
hesitated
he
was
amazed
at
his
own
attitude
then
will
you
dine
with
me
i
kept
this
evening
for
but
when
he
saw
her
his
sense
of
discomfort
only
increased
their
dining
together
was
natural
enough
it
was
not
even
faintly
clandestine
but
the
new
restraint
he
put
on
himself
made
him
reserved
and
unhappy
he
could
not
act
a
part
and
after
a
time
audrey
left
off
acting
too
and
he
found
her
watching
him
on
the
surface
he
talked
but
underneath
it
he
saw
her
unhappiness
and
her
understanding
of
his
i
going
back
too
she
said
i
came
down
to
see
what
i
can
do
but
there
is
nothing
for
the
untrained
woman
she
a
cumberer
of
the
earth
i
go
home
and
knit
i
daresay
i
ought
to
be
able
to
learn
to
do
that
well
have
you
forgiven
me
for
this
afternoon
i
was
angry
i
that
was
it
in
a
nutshell
audrey
understood
she
was
that
sort
she
never
held
small
resentments
he
rather
thought
she
never
felt
them
do
talk
about
me
she
said
tell
me
about
you
and
why
you
are
here
it
the
war
of
so
rather
reluctantly
he
told
her
he
shrank
from
seeming
to
want
her
approval
but
at
the
same
time
he
wanted
it
his
faith
in
himself
had
been
shaken
he
needed
it
restored
and
some
of
the
exaltation
which
had
led
him
to
make
his
proffer
to
the
government
came
back
when
he
saw
how
she
flushed
over
it
it
very
big
she
said
softly
it
like
you
clay
and
that
the
best
thing
i
can
say
i
am
very
proud
of
i
would
rather
have
you
proud
of
me
than
anything
in
the
world
he
said
unsteadily
they
drifted
somehow
to
talking
of
happiness
and
always
carefully
veiled
it
was
their
own
happiness
they
discussed
i
do
think
she
said
glancing
away
from
him
that
one
finds
it
by
looking
for
it
that
is
selfish
and
the
selfish
are
never
happy
it
comes
oh
in
queer
ways
when
you
trying
to
give
it
to
somebody
else
there
is
happiness
of
a
sort
in
their
eyes
met
that
was
what
they
had
to
face
she
dedicated
to
service
he
to
labor
it
never
found
by
making
other
people
unhappy
no
and
yet
if
the
other
people
are
already
unhappy
never
she
said
and
the
answer
was
to
the
unspoken
question
in
both
their
hearts
it
was
not
until
they
were
in
the
taxicab
that
clayton
forced
the
personal
note
and
then
it
came
as
a
cry
out
of
the
very
depths
of
him
she
had
slipped
her
hand
into
his
and
the
comfort
of
even
that
small
touch
broke
down
the
barriers
he
had
so
carefully
erected
i
need
you
so
he
said
and
he
held
her
hand
to
his
face
she
made
no
movement
to
withdraw
it
i
need
you
too
she
replied
i
never
get
over
needing
you
but
we
are
going
to
play
the
game
clay
we
may
have
our
weak
hours
and
this
is
one
of
them
but
always
please
god
we
play
the
the
curious
humility
he
felt
with
her
was
in
his
voice
i
need
your
help
even
in
and
that
touch
of
boyishness
almost
broke
down
her
reserve
of
strength
she
wanted
to
draw
his
head
down
on
her
shoulder
and
comfort
him
she
wanted
to
smooth
back
his
heavy
hair
and
put
her
arms
around
him
and
hold
him
there
was
a
great
tenderness
in
her
for
him
there
were
times
when
she
would
have
given
the
world
to
have
gone
into
his
arms
and
let
him
hold
her
there
protected
and
shielded
but
that
night
she
was
the
stronger
and
she
knew
it
i
love
you
audrey
i
love
you
and
that
was
the
word
for
it
it
was
terrible
she
knew
it
to
have
gone
through
all
the
world
he
said
brokenly
and
then
to
find
the
woman
when
it
is
too
late
forever
too
he
turned
toward
her
you
know
it
do
you
that
you
are
my
woman
i
know
it
she
answered
steadily
but
i
know
too
let
me
say
it
just
once
then
never
again
i
bury
it
but
you
will
know
it
is
there
you
are
my
woman
i
would
go
through
all
of
life
alone
to
find
you
at
the
end
and
if
i
could
look
forward
dear
to
going
through
the
rest
of
it
with
you
beside
me
so
i
could
touch
you
like
this
i
if
i
could
only
protect
you
and
shield
you
oh
how
tenderly
i
could
care
for
you
my
dear
my
dear
the
strength
passed
to
him
then
audrey
had
a
clear
picture
of
what
life
with
him
might
mean
of
his
protection
his
tenderness
she
had
never
known
it
suddenly
every
bit
of
her
called
out
for
his
care
his
quiet
strength
do
make
me
sorry
for
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
will
you
kiss
me
clay
we
might
have
that
to
but
they
were
not
to
have
even
that
for
the
taxicab
drew
up
before
her
hotel
it
was
one
of
the
absurd
of
life
that
they
should
part
with
a
and
her
formal
thank
you
for
a
lovely
audrey
was
the
better
actor
of
the
two
she
went
in
as
casually
as
though
she
had
not
put
the
only
happiness
of
her
life
away
from
her
but
clayton
spencer
stood
on
the
pavement
watching
her
in
and
all
the
tragedy
of
the
empty
years
ahead
was
in
his
eyes
chapter
xxxv
left
alone
in
her
untidy
room
after
graham
abrupt
departure
anna
klein
was
dazed
she
stood
where
he
left
her
staring
ahead
what
had
happened
meant
only
one
thing
to
her
that
graham
no
longer
cared
about
her
and
if
that
was
true
she
did
not
care
to
live
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
he
had
done
rather
a
fine
thing
or
that
he
had
protected
her
against
herself
she
felt
no
particular
shame
save
the
shame
of
rejection
in
her
small
world
of
the
hill
if
a
man
gave
a
girl
valuable
gifts
or
money
there
was
generally
a
quid
pro
quo
if
the
girl
was
unwilling
she
did
not
accept
such
gifts
if
the
man
wanted
nothing
he
did
not
make
them
and
men
who
made
love
to
girls
either
wanted
to
marry
them
or
desired
some
other
relationship
with
them
she
listened
to
his
retreating
footsteps
and
then
began
automatically
to
unbutton
her
thin
white
blouse
but
with
the
sound
of
the
engine
of
his
car
below
she
ran
to
the
window
she
leaned
out
elbows
on
the
sill
and
watched
him
go
without
a
look
up
at
her
window
so
that
was
the
end
of
that
then
all
at
once
she
was
fiercely
angry
he
had
got
her
into
this
scrape
and
now
he
had
left
her
he
had
pretended
to
love
her
and
all
the
time
he
had
meant
to
do
just
this
to
let
her
offer
herself
so
he
might
reject
her
he
had
been
playing
with
her
she
had
lost
her
home
because
of
him
had
been
beaten
almost
insensible
had
been
ill
for
weeks
and
now
he
had
driven
away
without
even
looking
back
she
jerked
her
blouse
off
still
standing
by
the
window
and
when
the
sleeve
caught
on
her
watch
she
jerked
that
off
too
she
stood
for
a
moment
with
it
in
her
hand
her
face
twisted
with
shame
and
anger
then
recklessly
and
furiously
she
flung
it
through
the
open
window
in
the
stillness
of
the
street
far
below
she
heard
it
strike
and
rebound
that
for
him
she
muttered
almost
immediately
she
wanted
it
again
he
had
given
it
to
her
it
was
all
she
had
left
now
and
in
a
curious
way
it
had
through
long
wearing
come
to
mean
graham
to
her
she
leaned
out
of
the
window
she
thought
she
saw
it
gleaming
in
the
gutter
and
already
attracted
by
the
crash
a
man
was
crossing
the
street
to
where
it
lay
you
let
that
alone
she
called
down
desperately
the
figure
was
already
stooping
over
it
entirely
reckless
now
she
ran
and
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
street
she
had
thought
to
see
its
finder
escaping
but
he
was
still
standing
where
he
had
picked
it
up
it
mine
she
began
i
dropped
it
out
of
the
window
i
you
threw
it
out
of
the
window
i
saw
it
was
rudolph
you
he
snarled
and
stood
with
menacing
eyes
fixed
on
her
bare
neck
rudolph
get
into
the
house
he
said
roughly
you
give
me
my
i
give
it
to
you
all
right
what
left
of
it
when
we
get
he
followed
her
into
the
hail
but
when
she
turned
there
and
held
out
her
hand
he
only
snarled
again
we
talk
i
ca
take
you
up
the
landlady
do
allow
she
do
eh
you
had
that
spencer
skunk
up
his
face
frightened
her
and
she
lied
vehemently
that
not
so
and
you
know
it
rudolph
klein
he
came
inside
just
like
this
and
we
stood
and
talked
then
he
went
away
he
was
inside
ten
her
voice
rose
hysterically
but
rudolph
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
pushing
her
ahead
of
him
forced
her
up
the
stairs
we
going
to
have
this
out
he
muttered
viciously
half
way
up
she
stopped
you
hurting
my
you
be
glad
i
not
breaking
it
for
he
climbed
in
a
mounting
fury
he
almost
threw
her
into
her
room
and
closing
the
door
he
turned
the
key
in
it
his
face
reminded
her
of
her
father
the
night
he
had
beaten
her
and
her
instinct
of
made
her
put
the
little
table
between
them
you
lay
a
hand
on
me
she
panted
and
i
yell
out
the
window
the
police
would
be
glad
enough
to
have
something
on
you
rudolph
klein
and
you
know
they
arrest
women
like
you
do
you
dare
say
and
as
he
took
a
step
or
two
toward
her
she
retreated
to
the
window
you
stay
there
or
i
jump
out
of
the
she
looked
desperate
enough
to
do
it
and
rudolph
hesitated
he
was
up
here
i
saw
him
at
the
window
i
been
trailing
you
all
evening
keep
off
that
you
little
fool
i
not
going
to
kill
you
but
i
going
to
get
him
all
right
and
do
you
forget
his
milder
tone
and
the
threat
frightened
her
more
than
ever
he
would
get
graham
he
was
like
that
get
him
in
some
cruel
helpless
way
that
was
the
german
blood
in
him
she
began
to
play
for
time
with
instinctive
cunning
listen
rudolph
she
said
i
tell
you
all
about
it
he
did
come
up
but
he
left
right
away
we
quarreled
he
threw
me
over
rudolph
that
what
he
her
own
words
reminded
her
of
her
humiliation
and
tears
came
into
her
eyes
he
threw
me
over
honest
he
did
that
why
i
threw
his
watch
out
of
the
window
that
straight
rudolph
that
straight
goods
i
not
lying
god
said
rudolph
the
dirty
pup
then
then
you
through
with
him
eh
i
through
all
her
tone
carried
conviction
rudolph
face
relaxed
and
seeing
that
she
remembered
her
condition
throw
me
that
waist
she
said
come
around
and
get
aw
rudolph
throw
it
please
getting
modest
all
at
once
he
jeered
but
he
picked
it
up
and
advanced
to
the
table
with
it
as
she
held
out
her
hand
for
it
he
caught
her
and
drew
her
forward
toward
him
across
the
table
you
little
devil
he
said
and
kissed
her
she
submitted
because
she
must
but
she
shivered
if
she
was
to
save
graham
she
must
play
the
game
and
so
far
she
was
winning
she
was
feminine
enough
to
know
that
already
the
thing
he
thought
she
had
done
was
to
be
forgiven
her
more
than
that
she
saw
a
admiration
in
rudolph
eyes
as
though
she
had
gained
value
if
she
had
lost
virtue
by
the
fact
that
young
spencer
had
fancied
her
and
rudolph
morals
were
the
morals
of
many
of
his
kind
he
admired
chastity
in
a
girl
but
he
did
not
expect
it
but
she
was
watchful
for
the
next
move
he
might
make
that
it
was
not
what
she
expected
did
not
make
it
the
less
terrifying
you
get
your
hat
and
coat
i
not
do
anything
of
the
think
i
going
to
leave
you
here
where
he
can
come
back
whenever
he
wants
to
you
think
again
where
are
you
going
to
take
me
i
going
to
take
you
when
pleading
made
no
impression
on
him
and
when
he
refused
to
move
without
her
she
threw
her
small
wardrobe
into
the
suitcase
and
put
her
hat
and
coat
on
she
was
past
thinking
quite
hopeless
she
would
go
back
and
her
father
would
kill
her
which
would
be
the
best
thing
anyhow
she
did
care
to
live
rudolph
had
relapsed
into
moody
silence
down
the
stairs
and
on
the
street
he
preceded
her
contemptuously
letting
her
trail
behind
he
carried
her
suitcase
however
and
once
being
insecurely
fastened
it
opened
and
bits
of
untidy
apparel
littered
the
pavement
he
dropped
the
suitcase
and
stood
by
while
she
filled
it
again
the
softness
of
that
moment
when
lured
by
her
bare
arms
he
had
kissed
her
was
gone
the
night
car
jolted
and
swayed
after
a
time
he
dozed
and
anna
watching
him
made
an
attempt
at
flight
he
caught
her
on
the
rear
platform
however
with
a
clutch
that
sickened
her
the
conductor
eyed
them
with
the
scant
curiosity
of
two
in
the
morning
when
all
the
waking
world
is
awry
at
last
they
were
climbing
the
hill
to
the
cottage
while
behind
and
below
them
the
spencer
furnaces
sent
out
their
orange
and
violet
flames
and
the
roar
of
the
blast
sounded
like
the
coming
of
a
mighty
wind
the
cottage
was
dark
rudolph
put
down
the
suitcase
and
called
herman
softly
through
his
hands
above
they
could
hear
him
moving
and
his
angry
voice
came
through
the
open
window
what
you
want
come
down
it
but
when
he
turned
anna
was
lying
in
a
dead
faint
on
the
garden
path
a
crumpled
little
heap
of
blissful
forgetfulness
when
herman
came
down
it
was
to
find
rudolph
standing
over
her
the
suitcase
still
in
his
hand
and
an
ugly
scowl
on
his
face
well
i
got
her
he
said
she
scared
that
he
prodded
her
with
his
foot
but
she
did
not
move
and
herman
bent
down
with
his
candle
he
straightened
bring
her
in
he
said
and
led
the
way
into
the
house
when
rudolph
staggered
in
with
anna
in
his
arms
he
found
herman
waiting
and
fingering
the
leather
strap
chapter
xxxvi
audrey
had
found
something
to
do
at
last
it
was
captain
sloane
who
had
given
her
the
idea
you
would
make
a
great
hit
audrey
he
had
said
it
your
voice
you
know
there
something
about
it
well
you
know
the
effect
it
always
has
on
me
no
all
right
i
be
but
she
had
carried
the
idea
home
with
her
and
had
proceeded
with
her
customary
decision
to
act
on
it
then
one
day
in
may
she
was
surprised
by
a
visit
from
delight
haverford
she
had
come
home
tired
and
rather
depressed
to
find
the
haverford
car
at
the
door
and
delight
waiting
for
her
in
her
audrey
acquaintance
with
delight
had
been
rather
fragmentary
but
it
had
covered
a
long
stretch
of
time
so
if
she
was
surprised
it
was
not
greatly
when
delight
suddenly
kissed
her
she
saw
then
that
the
girl
had
brought
her
some
spring
flowers
and
the
little
tribute
touched
her
what
a
nice
child
you
are
she
said
and
standing
before
the
mirror
proceeded
to
take
off
her
hat
before
her
she
could
see
the
reflection
of
delight
face
and
her
own
tired
slightly
haggard
eyes
and
how
unutterably
old
you
make
me
look
she
added
smiling
you
are
too
lovely
for
words
audrey
patted
her
hair
into
order
and
continued
her
smiling
inspection
of
the
girl
face
and
now
we
have
exchanged
compliments
she
said
we
will
have
some
tea
and
then
you
shall
tell
me
what
you
are
so
excited
i
am
excited
i
let
have
the
tea
audrey
housekeeping
was
still
rather
casual
tidiness
of
meticulous
order
would
always
be
beyond
her
but
after
certain
frantic
searches
for
what
was
needed
she
made
some
delicious
tea
order
was
left
out
of
me
somehow
she
complained
or
else
things
move
about
when
i
away
i
sure
it
is
that
because
i
certainly
never
put
the
sugar
behind
my
best
hat
now
let
have
delight
was
only
playing
with
her
tea
she
flushed
delicately
and
put
the
cup
down
i
was
in
the
crowd
this
morning
she
said
in
the
crowd
oh
my
crowd
i
see
said
audrey
thoughtfully
i
make
a
dreadful
speech
you
i
thought
you
were
wonderful
and
when
those
men
promised
to
enlist
i
cried
i
was
horribly
ashamed
but
you
were
i
wonder
said
audrey
growing
grave
delight
was
astonished
to
see
that
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
i
do
it
because
it
is
all
i
can
do
and
of
course
they
must
go
but
some
times
at
night
you
see
my
dear
some
of
them
are
going
to
be
killed
i
am
urging
them
to
go
but
the
better
the
day
i
have
had
the
less
i
sleep
at
there
was
a
little
pause
delight
was
thinking
desperately
of
something
to
say
but
you
did
come
to
talk
about
me
did
you
partly
and
partly
about
myself
i
want
to
do
something
valentine
i
can
drive
a
car
but
not
very
well
i
do
know
a
thing
about
the
engine
and
i
can
nurse
a
little
i
like
audrey
studied
her
face
it
seemed
to
her
sad
beyond
words
that
this
young
girl
who
should
have
had
only
happiness
was
facing
the
horrors
of
what
would
probably
be
a
long
war
it
was
the
young
who
paid
the
price
of
war
in
death
in
empty
years
already
the
careless
gayety
of
their
lives
was
gone
for
the
dream
futures
they
had
planned
they
had
now
to
substitute
long
waiting
for
happiness
service
the
red
cross
is
going
to
send
canteen
workers
to
france
you
might
do
if
i
only
could
but
i
ca
leave
mother
not
entirely
father
is
going
he
wants
to
go
and
fight
but
i
afraid
they
wo
take
him
he
go
as
a
chaplain
anyhow
but
he
perfectly
helpless
you
know
mother
says
she
is
going
to
tie
his
overshoes
around
his
i
see
if
i
can
think
of
something
for
you
delight
there
one
thing
in
my
mind
there
are
to
be
little
houses
built
in
all
the
new
for
officers
and
they
are
to
be
managed
by
women
they
are
to
serve
food
sandwiches
and
coffee
i
think
they
may
be
even
more
pretentious
i
do
know
but
i
find
i
do
anything
said
delight
and
got
up
it
was
then
that
audrey
realized
that
there
was
something
more
to
the
visit
than
had
appeared
for
delight
ready
to
go
hesitated
there
is
something
else
valentine
she
said
rather
slowly
what
would
you
do
if
a
young
man
wanted
to
go
into
the
service
and
somebody
held
him
back
his
own
people
his
mother
and
a
i
would
think
the
army
is
well
off
without
delight
flushed
painfully
perhaps
she
admitted
but
is
it
right
just
to
let
it
go
at
that
if
you
like
people
it
seems
wrong
just
to
stand
by
and
let
others
ruin
their
lives
for
only
very
weak
men
let
women
ruin
their
but
already
she
began
to
understand
the
situation
there
a
weakness
that
is
only
a
sort
of
habit
it
may
come
from
not
wanting
to
hurt
delight
was
pulling
nervously
at
her
gloves
and
there
is
this
to
be
said
too
if
there
is
what
you
call
weakness
would
the
army
be
good
for
it
it
makes
men
some
times
does
it
for
a
sickening
moment
audrey
thought
of
chris
war
had
made
chris
but
it
had
killed
him
too
have
you
thought
of
one
thing
she
asked
that
in
trying
to
make
this
young
man
whoever
it
is
he
may
be
hurt
or
even
worse
he
would
have
to
take
his
chance
like
the
she
went
a
little
pale
however
audrey
impulsively
put
an
arm
around
her
and
this
woman
is
the
little
girl
who
used
to
give
signals
to
her
father
when
the
sermon
was
too
long
now
what
can
i
do
about
this
youth
who
ca
make
up
his
own
mind
you
can
talk
to
his
if
i
know
his
mother
and
i
think
i
do
it
wo
do
the
slightest
then
his
father
you
are
great
friends
are
you
even
this
indirect
mention
of
clayton
made
audrey
hands
tremble
she
put
them
behind
her
we
are
very
good
friends
she
said
but
delight
was
too
engrossed
to
notice
the
deeper
note
in
her
voice
i
see
what
i
can
do
but
count
on
me
too
much
you
spoke
of
a
girl
i
suppose
i
know
who
it
probably
it
is
marion
hayden
he
is
engaged
to
and
again
audrey
marveled
at
her
poise
for
delight
little
tragedy
was
clear
by
that
time
clear
and
very
sad
i
ca
imagine
his
really
being
in
love
with
but
he
must
be
they
are
audrey
smiled
at
the
simple
philosophy
of
nineteen
smiled
and
was
extremely
touched
how
brave
the
child
was
audrey
own
courageous
heart
rather
swelled
in
admiration
but
after
delight
had
gone
she
felt
depressed
again
and
very
tired
how
badly
these
things
were
handled
how
strange
it
was
that
love
so
often
brought
suffering
great
loves
were
almost
always
great
tragedies
perhaps
it
was
because
love
was
never
truly
great
until
the
element
of
sacrifice
entered
into
it
her
own
high
courage
failed
her
somewhat
during
these
recent
days
when
struggling
against
very
real
stage
fright
she
made
her
husky
wholly
earnest
but
rather
nervous
little
appeals
to
the
crowds
before
the
enlisting
stations
she
got
along
bravely
enough
during
the
day
but
the
night
found
her
sad
unutterably
depressed
at
these
times
she
was
haunted
by
a
fear
that
persisted
against
all
her
arguments
in
washington
clayton
had
not
looked
well
he
had
been
very
tired
and
white
and
some
of
his
natural
buoyancy
seemed
to
have
deserted
him
he
needed
caring
for
she
would
reflect
bitterly
there
should
be
some
one
to
look
after
him
he
was
tired
and
anxious
but
it
took
the
eyes
of
love
to
see
it
natalie
would
never
notice
and
would
consider
it
a
grievance
if
she
did
the
fiercely
maternal
tenderness
of
the
childless
woman
for
the
man
she
loves
kept
her
awake
at
night
staring
into
the
darkness
and
visualizing
terrible
things
clayton
ill
and
she
unable
to
go
to
him
ill
and
wanting
her
and
unable
to
ask
for
her
she
was
she
knew
not
quite
normal
but
the
fear
gripped
and
held
her
these
big
strong
men
no
one
ever
looked
after
them
they
spent
their
lives
caring
for
others
and
were
never
cared
for
there
were
times
when
a
sort
of
exaltation
of
sacrifice
kept
her
head
high
when
the
thing
she
was
forced
to
give
up
seemed
trifling
compared
with
the
men
and
boys
who
some
determinedly
some
sheepishly
left
the
crowd
around
the
borrowed
car
from
which
she
spoke
and
went
into
the
recruiting
station
there
was
sacrifice
and
sacrifice
and
there
was
some
comfort
in
the
thought
that
both
she
and
clayton
were
putting
the
happiness
of
others
above
their
own
they
had
both
somehow
somewhere
missed
the
path
but
they
must
never
go
back
and
try
to
find
it
delight
visit
left
her
thoughtful
there
must
be
some
way
to
save
graham
she
wondered
how
much
of
clayton
weariness
was
due
to
graham
and
she
wondered
too
if
he
knew
of
the
talk
about
natalie
and
rodney
page
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
somehow
such
talk
cheapened
his
sacrifice
and
hers
not
that
she
believed
it
or
much
of
it
she
knew
how
little
such
gossip
actually
meant
practically
every
woman
she
knew
herself
included
had
at
one
time
or
another
laid
herself
open
to
such
invidious
comment
they
had
all
been
idle
and
they
sought
amusement
in
such
spurious
affairs
as
this
harmless
in
the
main
but
taking
on
the
appearance
of
evil
that
was
part
of
the
game
to
appear
worse
than
one
really
was
the
older
the
woman
the
more
eager
she
was
often
in
her
clutch
at
the
vanishing
romance
of
youth
only
it
was
part
of
the
game
too
to
avoid
scandal
a
fierce
pride
for
clayton
name
sent
the
color
to
her
face
on
the
evening
after
delight
visit
she
had
promised
to
speak
at
a
recruiting
station
far
in
a
crowded
tenement
district
and
tired
as
she
was
she
took
a
bus
and
went
down
at
seven
she
was
uneasy
and
nervous
she
had
not
spoken
in
the
evening
before
and
in
all
her
sheltered
life
she
had
never
seen
the
milling
of
a
night
crowd
in
a
slum
district
there
was
a
wagon
drawn
up
at
the
curb
and
an
young
clergyman
was
speaking
the
crowd
was
attentive
mildly
curious
the
clergyman
was
emphatic
without
being
convincing
audrey
watched
the
faces
about
her
standing
in
the
crowd
herself
and
a
sense
of
the
futility
of
it
all
gripped
her
all
these
men
and
only
a
feeble
cheer
as
a
boy
still
in
his
teens
agreed
to
volunteer
all
this
effort
for
such
scant
result
and
over
on
the
other
side
such
dire
need
but
one
thing
cheered
her
beside
her
in
the
crowd
a
portly
elderly
jew
was
standing
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
when
a
man
near
him
made
some
jeering
comment
the
jew
brought
his
hand
down
on
his
shoulder
be
still
and
listen
he
said
or
else
go
away
and
allow
others
to
listen
this
is
our
country
which
it
amusing
is
it
audrey
heard
a
woman
voice
near
her
carefully
inflected
slightly
affected
it
rather
stunning
in
a
way
it
decorative
the
white
faces
and
that
chap
in
the
wagon
and
the
gasoline
i
enjoy
it
more
if
i
had
my
the
man
laughed
you
are
a
most
brazen
combination
of
the
mundane
and
the
spiritual
natalie
you
are
all
soul
after
you
are
fed
come
on
it
near
audrey
hands
were
very
cold
by
the
movement
of
the
crowd
behind
her
she
knew
that
natalie
and
rodney
were
making
their
escape
toward
food
and
a
quiet
talk
in
some
obscure
restaurant
in
the
neighborhood
fierce
anger
shook
her
for
this
she
and
clayton
were
giving
up
the
only
hope
they
had
of
happiness
that
natalie
might
carry
on
a
cheap
and
stealthy
flirtation
she
made
a
magnificent
appeal
that
night
and
a
very
successful
one
the
lethargic
crowd
waked
up
and
pressed
forward
there
were
occasional
cheers
and
now
and
then
the
greater
tribute
of
convinced
silence
and
on
a
box
in
the
wagon
the
young
clergyman
eyed
her
almost
wistfully
what
a
woman
she
was
with
such
a
woman
a
man
could
live
up
to
the
best
in
him
then
he
remembered
his
salary
in
a
mission
church
of
twelve
hundred
a
year
and
sighed
he
gained
courage
later
on
and
asked
audrey
if
she
would
have
some
coffee
with
him
or
something
to
eat
she
looked
tired
tired
said
audrey
i
am
only
tired
these
days
when
i
am
not
you
must
not
use
yourself
up
you
are
too
valuable
to
the
she
was
very
grateful
after
all
what
else
really
mattered
in
a
little
glow
she
accepted
his
invitation
only
coffee
she
said
i
have
had
dinner
is
there
any
place
near
he
piloted
her
through
the
crowd
now
rapidly
dispersing
here
and
there
some
man
often
in
halting
english
thanked
her
for
what
she
had
said
a
woman
slightly
the
worse
for
drink
but
with
friendly
rather
humorous
eyes
put
a
hand
on
her
arm
you
all
right
she
said
you
the
stuff
give
it
to
them
i
wish
to
god
i
could
talk
i
tell
the
clergyman
drew
her
on
hastily
in
a
small
italian
restaurant
almost
deserted
they
found
a
table
and
the
clergyman
ordered
eggs
and
coffee
he
was
a
trifle
uneasy
in
the
wagon
audrey
plain
dark
clothes
had
deceived
him
but
the
single
pearl
on
her
finger
was
very
valuable
he
fell
to
apologizing
for
the
place
i
often
come
here
he
explained
the
food
is
good
if
you
like
italian
cooking
and
it
is
near
my
work
i
but
audrey
was
not
listening
at
a
corner
far
back
natalie
and
rodney
were
sitting
engrossed
in
each
other
natalie
back
was
carefully
turned
to
the
room
but
there
was
no
mistaking
her
audrey
wanted
madly
to
get
away
but
the
coffee
had
come
and
the
young
clergyman
was
talking
gentle
platitudes
in
a
rather
sweet
but
monotonous
voice
then
rodney
saw
her
and
bowed
almost
immediately
afterward
she
heard
the
soft
rustle
that
was
natalie
and
found
them
both
beside
her
can
we
run
you
natalie
asked
that
is
unless
she
glanced
at
the
clergyman
thank
you
no
natalie
i
going
to
have
some
supper
natalie
was
uneasy
audrey
made
no
move
to
present
the
clergyman
whose
name
she
did
not
know
rodney
was
looking
slightly
bored
odd
little
place
is
it
natalie
offered
after
a
second
silence
rather
quaint
i
natalie
made
a
desperate
effort
to
smooth
over
an
awkward
situation
she
turned
to
the
clergyman
we
heard
you
speaking
it
was
quite
he
smiled
a
little
not
so
thrilling
as
this
lady
she
carried
the
crowd
natalie
turned
and
stared
at
audrey
who
was
flushed
with
annoyance
you
she
said
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
been
talking
from
that
wagon
i
have
said
it
but
i
for
heaven
sake
then
she
laughed
and
glanced
at
rodney
well
if
you
wo
tell
on
me
i
not
tell
on
and
then
seeing
audrey
straighten
i
do
mean
that
of
course
clay
at
a
meeting
so
i
am
having
a
she
moved
on
always
with
the
soft
rustle
leaving
behind
her
a
delicate
whiff
of
violets
and
a
clergyman
who
stared
after
her
admiringly
what
a
beautiful
woman
he
said
there
was
a
faint
regret
in
his
voice
that
audrey
had
not
presented
him
and
he
did
not
see
that
her
trembled
as
she
lifted
it
to
her
lips
at
ten
the
next
morning
natalie
called
her
on
the
natalie
morning
voice
was
always
languid
but
there
was
a
trace
of
pleading
in
it
now
it
a
lovely
day
she
said
what
are
you
doing
i
been
you
darning
i
rather
like
heavens
how
you
changed
i
suppose
you
would
do
anything
so
frivolous
as
to
go
out
with
me
to
the
new
audrey
hesitated
evidently
natalie
wanted
to
talk
to
try
to
justify
herself
but
the
feeling
that
she
was
the
last
woman
in
the
world
to
be
natalie
was
strong
in
her
on
the
other
hand
there
was
the
question
of
graham
on
that
before
long
she
and
natalie
would
have
in
one
of
her
own
occasional
lapses
into
slang
to
go
to
the
mat
i
come
of
course
if
that
an
i
be
around
in
an
hour
natalie
was
unusually
prompt
she
was
nervous
and
excited
and
was
even
more
carefully
dressed
than
usual
over
her
dark
blue
velvet
dress
she
wore
a
loose
with
a
great
chinchilla
collar
but
above
it
audrey
who
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
be
able
to
hate
her
found
her
rather
pathetic
a
little
droop
to
her
mouth
dark
circles
which
no
veil
could
hide
under
her
eyes
the
car
was
in
its
customary
resplendent
condition
there
were
orchids
in
the
and
the
footman
light
rug
over
his
arm
stood
rigidly
waiting
at
the
door
what
a
tone
you
and
your
outfit
do
give
my
little
street
audrey
said
as
they
started
we
have
more
than
limousines
you
i
do
see
how
you
can
bear
audrey
smiled
it
really
rather
nice
she
said
for
one
thing
i
have
any
bills
i
never
lived
on
a
cash
basis
before
it
a
sort
of
oh
bills
said
natalie
and
waved
her
hands
despairingly
if
you
could
see
my
desk
and
the
way
i
watch
the
mail
so
clay
wo
see
them
first
they
really
ought
to
send
bills
in
blank
but
you
have
to
give
them
to
him
eventually
do
you
i
can
choose
my
moment
and
it
is
never
in
the
morning
he
rather
awful
in
the
awful
oh
not
ugly
just
quiet
i
hate
a
man
who
does
talk
in
the
mornings
but
then
for
months
he
has
really
talked
at
all
why
she
was
rather
breathless
that
why
i
went
out
with
rodney
last
i
do
think
clayton
would
mind
if
you
told
him
first
it
your
own
affair
of
course
but
it
does
seem
quite
fair
to
oh
of
course
you
side
with
him
women
always
side
with
the
i
do
with
any
one
audrey
protested
but
i
am
sure
if
he
realized
that
you
are
lonely
suddenly
she
realized
that
natalie
was
crying
not
much
but
enough
to
force
her
to
dab
her
eyes
carefully
through
her
veil
i
awfully
unhappy
audrey
she
said
everything
wrong
and
i
do
know
why
what
have
i
done
i
try
and
try
and
things
just
get
audrey
was
very
uncomfortable
she
had
a
guilty
feeling
that
the
whole
situation
with
natalie
pouring
out
her
woes
beside
her
was
indelicate
unbearable
but
if
clay
she
began
clay
he
absolutely
ungrateful
he
takes
me
for
granted
and
the
house
for
granted
everything
and
if
he
knows
i
want
a
thing
he
disapproves
at
once
i
think
sometimes
he
takes
a
vicious
pleasure
in
thwarting
but
as
she
did
not
go
on
audrey
said
nothing
natalie
had
raised
her
veil
and
from
a
gold
was
repairing
the
damages
around
her
eyes
why
do
you
find
something
to
do
something
to
interest
you
audrey
suggested
finally
but
natalie
poured
out
a
list
of
duties
that
lasted
for
the
last
three
miles
of
the
trip
ending
with
the
new
house
even
that
has
ceased
to
be
a
satisfaction
she
finished
clayton
wants
to
stop
work
on
it
and
cut
down
all
the
estimates
it
too
awful
first
he
told
me
to
get
anything
i
liked
and
now
he
says
to
cut
down
to
nothing
i
could
just
shriek
about
perhaps
that
because
we
are
in
the
war
war
or
no
war
we
have
to
live
do
we
and
he
thinks
i
ought
to
do
without
the
extra
man
for
the
car
and
the
second
man
in
the
house
and
heaven
alone
knows
what
i
at
the
end
of
my
audrey
made
a
resolution
after
all
what
mattered
was
that
things
should
be
more
tolerable
for
clayton
she
turned
to
natalie
why
do
you
try
to
do
what
he
wants
natalie
he
must
have
a
reason
for
asking
you
and
it
would
please
him
a
if
i
start
making
concession
i
can
just
keep
it
up
he
like
he
so
awfully
fine
natalie
he
well
he
rather
big
and
sometimes
i
think
if
you
just
tried
he
would
be
so
hard
to
please
he
probably
wants
peace
and
happiness
happiness
natalie
voice
was
high
that
sounds
like
clay
happiness
do
you
suppose
i
want
to
be
happy
not
enough
to
work
for
it
said
audrey
evenly
natalie
turned
and
stared
at
her
i
believe
you
half
in
love
with
clay
yourself
perhaps
i
but
she
smiled
frankly
into
natalie
eyes
i
know
if
i
were
married
to
him
i
try
to
do
what
he
you
try
it
for
a
year
then
you
give
it
up
it
one
thing
to
admire
a
man
it
quite
different
being
married
to
him
and
having
to
put
up
with
all
sorts
of
things
her
voice
trailed
off
before
the
dark
vision
of
her
domestic
unhappiness
and
again
as
with
graham
and
his
father
it
was
what
she
did
not
say
that
counted
audrey
came
close
to
hating
her
just
then
so
far
the
conversation
had
not
touched
on
graham
and
now
they
were
turning
in
the
new
drive
already
the
lawns
were
showing
green
and
extensive
plantings
of
shrubbery
were
putting
out
their
pale
new
buds
audrey
bending
forward
in
the
car
found
it
very
lovely
and
because
it
belonged
to
clay
was
to
be
his
home
it
thrilled
her
just
as
the
towering
furnaces
of
his
mill
thrilled
her
the
lines
of
men
leaving
at
nightfall
it
was
his
therefore
it
was
significant
the
house
amazed
her
even
natalie
enthusiasm
had
not
promised
anything
so
stately
or
so
vast
moving
behind
her
through
great
empty
rooms
to
the
sound
of
incessant
hammering
over
which
natalie
voice
was
raised
shrilly
she
was
forced
to
confess
that
between
them
natalie
and
rodney
had
made
a
lovely
thing
she
felt
no
jealousy
when
she
contrasted
it
with
her
own
small
apartment
she
even
felt
that
it
was
the
sort
of
house
clayton
should
have
for
although
it
had
been
designed
as
a
setting
for
natalie
although
every
almost
every
chair
had
been
bought
with
a
view
to
forming
a
background
for
her
it
was
too
big
too
massive
it
dwarfed
her
audrey
lost
that
feeling
in
the
formal
garden
natalie
was
charmingly
framed
it
was
like
her
beautifully
exact
carefully
planned
already
with
its
spring
borders
faintly
glowing
natalie
cheered
in
her
approval
you
so
comforting
she
said
clay
thinks
it
is
homelike
he
says
it
a
show
place
which
it
ought
to
be
it
cost
enough
and
he
hates
show
places
he
really
ought
to
have
a
cottage
now
let
see
the
but
at
the
pool
she
lost
her
gayety
the
cement
basin
still
empty
gleamed
white
in
the
sun
and
natalie
suddenly
brooding
stood
beside
it
staring
absently
into
it
it
was
for
graham
she
said
at
last
we
were
going
to
have
parties
and
all
sorts
of
young
people
but
now
what
about
now
natalie
raised
tragic
eyes
to
hers
he
probably
going
into
the
army
he
have
never
thought
of
it
but
clayton
shows
in
every
possible
way
that
he
thinks
he
ought
to
go
what
is
the
boy
to
do
his
father
driving
him
to
what
may
be
his
death
i
do
think
he
do
that
natalie
laughed
her
little
mirthless
laugh
much
you
know
what
his
father
would
do
i
tell
you
this
audrey
if
graham
goes
and
anything
happens
to
him
i
never
forgive
clay
audrey
had
not
suspected
such
depths
of
feeling
as
natalie
eyes
showed
under
their
penciled
brows
they
were
desperate
vindictive
eyes
suddenly
natalie
was
pleading
with
her
you
talk
to
clay
wo
you
he
listen
to
you
he
has
a
lot
of
respect
for
your
opinion
i
want
you
to
go
to
him
audrey
i
brought
you
here
to
ask
you
i
almost
out
of
my
mind
why
do
you
suppose
i
play
around
with
rodney
i
got
to
forget
that
all
and
i
tried
everything
i
know
and
failed
he
go
and
i
lose
him
and
if
i
do
it
will
kill
it
does
follow
that
because
he
goes
he
wo
come
he
be
in
danger
i
shall
be
worrying
about
him
every
she
threw
out
her
hands
in
what
was
as
unrestrained
a
gesture
as
she
ever
made
look
at
me
she
cried
i
getting
old
under
it
i
have
lines
about
my
eyes
already
i
hate
to
look
at
myself
in
the
morning
and
not
old
i
ought
to
be
at
my
best
natalie
anxiety
was
for
graham
but
her
pity
was
for
herself
heart
hardened
i
sorry
she
said
i
ca
go
to
clay
i
feel
as
i
think
he
does
if
graham
wants
to
go
he
should
be
free
to
do
it
you
only
hurting
him
and
your
influence
on
him
by
holding
him
you
never
had
a
if
i
had
and
he
wanted
to
go
i
should
be
terrified
but
i
should
be
you
and
clay
you
even
talk
alike
it
all
a
pose
this
exalted
attitude
even
this
war
is
a
pose
it
a
national
attitude
struck
a
great
nation
going
to
rescue
humanity
while
the
rest
of
the
world
looks
on
and
applauds
it
makes
me
she
turned
and
went
back
to
the
house
leaving
audrey
by
the
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
one
of
the
stone
benches
feeling
utterly
dreary
and
sad
to
make
a
sacrifice
for
a
worthy
object
was
one
thing
to
throw
away
a
life
happiness
for
a
spoiled
petulant
woman
was
another
it
was
too
high
a
price
to
pay
mingled
with
her
depression
was
pity
for
clayton
for
all
the
years
that
he
had
lived
with
this
woman
and
pride
in
him
that
he
had
never
betrayed
his
disillusion
after
a
time
she
saw
the
car
waiting
and
she
went
slowly
back
to
the
house
natalie
was
already
inside
and
she
made
no
apologies
whatever
the
drive
back
was
difficult
natalie
openly
sulked
replied
in
monosyllables
made
no
effort
herself
until
they
were
in
the
city
again
then
she
said
i
sorry
i
asked
you
to
speak
to
clay
of
course
you
need
do
not
if
it
is
to
do
what
you
said
but
i
wish
you
would
misunderstand
me
natalie
i
awfully
sorry
we
just
think
we
certainly
do
said
natalie
briefly
and
that
was
her
chapter
xxxvii
when
clayton
had
returned
from
washington
one
of
the
first
problems
put
up
to
him
had
been
herman
klein
application
to
be
taken
on
again
he
found
hutchinson
in
favor
of
it
he
does
say
much
he
said
never
did
but
i
gather
things
are
changed
now
we
are
in
the
war
i
suppose
we
need
you
bet
we
need
for
the
problem
of
skilled
labor
was
already
a
grave
one
clayton
was
doubtful
if
he
could
have
conferred
with
dunbar
he
would
have
felt
more
comfortable
but
dunbar
was
away
on
some
mysterious
errand
connected
with
the
military
intelligence
department
he
sat
considering
tapping
on
his
desk
with
the
handle
of
his
pen
of
course
things
were
different
now
a
good
many
germans
whose
sympathies
had
as
between
the
fatherland
and
the
allies
been
with
germany
were
now
driven
to
a
decision
between
the
land
they
had
left
and
the
land
they
had
adopted
and
behind
herman
there
were
thirty
years
of
good
record
where
is
the
daughter
i
do
know
she
left
some
weeks
ago
it
talk
around
the
plant
that
he
beat
her
up
and
she
got
out
those
germans
do
know
the
first
thing
about
how
to
treat
then
she
is
not
in
weaver
office
there
was
more
talk
in
the
offices
than
hutchinson
repeated
fondness
for
anna
her
slavish
devotion
to
him
had
been
pretty
well
recognized
he
wondered
if
clayton
knew
anything
about
it
or
the
further
gossip
that
graham
knew
where
anna
klein
had
been
hiding
what
about
rudolph
klein
he
was
a
nephew
was
he
fired
said
hutchinson
laconically
got
to
spreading
the
brotherhood
of
the
world
idea
sweat
brothers
he
calls
them
but
he
was
mighty
careful
never
to
get
in
a
perspiration
we
might
try
herman
again
but
i
keep
an
eye
on
so
herman
was
taken
on
at
the
new
munition
plant
he
was
a
citizen
he
owned
property
he
had
a
record
of
long
service
behind
him
and
at
first
he
was
minded
to
preserve
that
record
intact
while
he
had
by
now
added
to
his
rage
against
the
fatherland
enemies
a
vast
and
sullen
fury
against
invested
capital
his
german
caution
still
remained
he
would
sit
through
fiery
denunciations
of
wealth
nodding
his
head
slowly
in
agreement
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
in
gus
little
back
room
dark
plots
were
hatched
indeed
on
a
certain
april
night
rudolph
had
come
up
and
called
him
onto
the
porch
in
about
fifteen
minutes
he
said
consulting
his
watch
in
the
doorway
i
going
to
show
you
something
and
in
fifteen
minutes
to
the
dot
the
great
railroad
warehouses
near
the
city
wharf
had
burst
into
flames
herman
had
watched
without
comment
while
rudolph
talked
incessantly
boasting
of
his
share
in
the
enterprise
about
a
million
dollars
worth
of
fireworks
there
he
said
as
the
glare
dyed
their
faces
red
all
stuff
for
the
and
he
boasted
when
the
cat
sits
on
the
pickhandle
brass
buttons
must
by
that
time
herman
knew
that
the
cat
meant
sabotage
he
had
nodded
slowly
but
it
is
dangerous
was
his
later
comment
sometimes
they
will
learn
and
then
his
caution
had
exasperated
rudolph
almost
to
frenzy
and
as
time
went
on
and
one
man
after
another
of
the
organization
was
ferreted
out
at
the
new
plant
and
dismissed
the
sole
remaining
hope
of
the
organization
was
herman
with
his
reinstatement
their
hopes
had
risen
again
but
to
every
suggestion
so
far
he
had
been
deaf
he
would
listen
approvingly
but
at
the
end
when
he
found
the
talk
veering
his
way
and
a
circle
of
intent
faces
watching
him
he
would
say
it
is
too
dangerous
and
it
is
a
young
man
work
i
am
not
then
he
would
pay
his
score
but
never
by
any
chance
rudolph
or
the
others
and
go
home
to
his
empty
house
but
recently
the
plant
had
gone
on
double
turn
and
herman
was
soon
to
go
on
at
night
here
was
the
gang
opportunity
everything
was
ready
but
herman
himself
he
continued
interested
but
impersonal
for
the
sake
of
the
fatherland
he
was
willing
to
have
the
plant
go
and
to
lose
his
work
he
was
not
at
all
daunted
by
the
thought
of
the
deaths
that
would
follow
that
was
war
anything
that
killed
and
destroyed
was
fair
in
war
but
he
did
not
care
to
place
himself
in
danger
let
those
young
do
the
work
rudolph
watching
him
bided
his
time
the
ground
was
plowed
and
harrowed
ready
for
the
seed
and
rudolph
had
only
to
find
the
seed
the
night
he
had
carried
anna
into
the
cottage
on
the
hill
he
had
found
it
herman
had
not
beaten
anna
rudolph
had
carried
her
up
to
her
bed
and
herman
following
slowly
strap
in
hand
had
been
confronted
by
the
younger
man
in
the
doorway
of
the
room
where
anna
lay
conscious
but
unmoving
on
the
bed
you
can
use
that
thing
later
rudolph
said
she
sick
now
better
let
her
i
will
teach
her
to
run
away
herman
muttered
thickly
she
left
me
her
father
and
threw
away
a
good
job
i
you
come
i
something
to
say
to
and
after
a
time
herman
had
followed
him
down
but
he
still
clung
doggedly
to
the
strap
rudolph
led
the
way
outside
and
here
in
the
darkness
he
told
story
twisted
and
distorted
through
his
own
warped
mind
but
convincing
and
partially
true
herman
silence
began
to
alarm
him
however
and
when
at
last
he
rose
and
made
for
the
door
rudolph
was
before
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
herman
said
nothing
but
he
raised
the
strap
and
held
it
menacingly
get
out
of
my
do
be
a
fool
rudolph
entreated
you
can
beat
her
to
death
and
what
do
you
get
out
of
it
she
run
away
again
if
you
touch
her
put
that
strap
down
i
not
afraid
of
their
voices
raised
and
angry
penetrated
through
anna
haze
of
fright
and
faintness
she
sat
up
in
the
bed
ready
to
spring
to
the
window
if
she
heard
steps
on
the
stairs
when
none
came
but
the
voices
lowered
now
went
on
endlessly
below
she
slipped
out
of
her
bed
and
crept
to
the
doorway
sounds
traveled
clearly
up
the
narrow
enclosed
stairway
she
stood
there
swaying
slightly
until
at
last
her
legs
would
no
longer
support
her
she
crouched
on
the
floor
a
hand
clutching
her
throat
lest
she
scream
and
listened
she
did
not
sleep
at
all
the
night
had
been
too
full
of
horrors
and
she
was
too
ill
to
attempt
a
second
flight
besides
where
could
she
go
katie
was
not
there
she
could
see
her
empty
little
room
across
with
its
cot
bed
and
tawdry
dresser
before
too
she
had
had
grahams
protection
to
count
on
now
she
had
nothing
and
the
voices
went
on
when
she
went
back
to
bed
it
was
almost
dawn
she
heard
herman
come
up
heard
the
heavy
thump
of
his
shoes
on
the
floor
and
the
creak
immediately
following
that
showed
he
had
lain
down
without
undressing
by
the
absence
of
his
resonant
snoring
she
knew
he
was
not
sleeping
either
she
pictured
him
lying
there
his
eyes
on
the
door
in
almost
unwinking
espionage
at
half
past
six
she
got
up
and
went
almost
immediately
she
heard
his
stockinged
feet
behind
her
she
turned
and
looked
up
at
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
going
to
make
myself
some
he
came
down
and
sat
down
in
the
from
where
he
sat
he
could
survey
the
kitchen
and
she
knew
his
eyes
were
on
her
his
very
quiet
terrified
her
but
although
the
strap
lay
on
the
table
he
made
no
move
toward
it
she
built
a
fire
and
put
on
the
kettle
and
after
a
time
she
brought
him
some
coffee
and
some
bread
he
took
it
without
a
word
sick
as
she
was
she
fell
to
cleaning
up
the
dirty
kitchen
she
went
outside
for
a
pail
to
find
him
behind
her
in
the
doorway
then
she
knew
what
he
intended
to
do
he
was
afraid
for
some
reason
to
beat
her
again
but
he
was
going
to
watch
her
lest
again
she
make
her
escape
the
silence
under
his
heavy
gaze
was
intolerable
all
day
she
worked
and
only
once
did
herman
lose
sight
of
her
that
was
when
he
took
a
ladder
and
outside
the
house
nailed
all
the
upper
windows
shut
he
did
it
with
german
thoroughness
hammering
deliberately
placing
his
nails
carefully
after
that
he
went
to
the
corner
grocery
but
before
he
went
he
spoke
the
first
words
of
the
day
you
will
go
to
your
she
went
and
he
locked
her
in
she
knew
then
that
she
was
a
prisoner
when
he
was
at
the
mill
at
night
while
he
slept
during
the
day
she
was
to
be
locked
up
in
her
stuffy
airless
room
when
he
was
about
she
would
do
the
housework
always
under
his
silent
contemptuous
gaze
she
made
one
appeal
to
him
and
only
one
and
that
was
to
his
cupidity
i
been
sick
but
i
able
to
work
now
he
paid
no
attention
to
her
if
you
lock
me
up
and
do
let
me
work
she
persisted
you
only
be
cutting
off
your
nose
to
spite
your
face
i
make
good
money
and
you
know
she
thought
he
was
going
to
speak
then
but
he
did
not
she
put
his
food
on
the
table
and
he
ate
gluttonously
as
he
always
did
she
did
not
sit
down
she
drank
a
little
coffee
standing
at
the
stove
and
watched
the
back
of
his
head
with
hate
in
her
eyes
he
could
eat
like
that
when
he
stood
committed
to
a
terrible
thing
it
was
not
until
late
in
the
day
that
it
began
to
dawn
on
her
how
she
was
responsible
she
was
getting
stronger
then
and
more
able
to
think
she
followed
as
best
she
could
the
events
of
the
last
months
and
she
saw
that
as
surely
as
though
a
malevolent
power
had
arranged
it
the
thing
was
the
result
of
her
infatuation
for
graham
she
was
in
despair
and
she
began
to
plan
how
to
get
word
to
graham
of
what
was
impending
she
scrawled
a
note
to
graham
telling
him
where
she
was
and
to
try
to
get
in
touch
with
her
somehow
if
he
would
come
around
four
herman
was
generally
up
and
off
to
the
grocer
or
to
gus
saloon
for
his
afternoon
beer
i
break
a
window
and
talk
to
you
she
wrote
i
locked
in
when
he
out
my
window
is
on
the
north
side
do
lose
any
time
something
terrible
going
to
but
several
days
went
by
and
the
postman
did
not
appear
herman
had
put
a
padlock
on
the
outside
of
her
bedroom
door
and
her
hope
of
finding
a
second
key
to
fit
the
died
then
it
had
become
a
silent
bitter
contest
between
the
two
of
them
with
two
advantages
in
favor
of
the
girl
she
was
more
intelligent
than
herman
and
she
knew
the
thing
he
was
planning
to
do
she
made
a
careful
survey
of
her
room
and
she
saw
that
with
a
she
could
unfasten
the
hinge
of
her
bedroom
door
herman
however
always
kept
his
tools
locked
up
she
managed
apparently
by
accident
to
break
the
point
off
a
knife
and
when
she
went
up
to
her
room
one
afternoon
to
be
locked
in
while
herman
went
to
gus
saloon
she
carried
the
knife
in
her
stocking
it
was
a
sorry
tool
however
driven
by
her
shaking
hand
there
was
a
time
when
she
almost
despaired
and
time
was
flying
the
postman
when
he
came
came
at
five
and
she
heard
the
kitchen
clock
strike
five
before
the
first
screw
fell
out
into
her
hand
she
got
them
all
out
finally
and
the
door
hung
crazily
held
only
by
the
padlock
she
ran
to
the
window
the
postman
was
coming
along
the
street
and
she
hammered
madly
at
the
glass
when
he
saw
her
he
turned
in
at
the
gate
and
she
got
her
letter
and
ran
down
the
stairs
she
heard
his
step
on
the
porch
outside
and
called
to
him
is
that
you
briggs
the
postman
was
briggs
to
the
hill
if
i
slide
a
letter
out
under
the
door
will
you
take
it
to
the
for
me
it
all
right
she
had
put
it
partially
under
the
door
when
a
doubt
crept
into
her
mind
that
was
not
briggs
voice
she
made
a
frantic
effort
to
draw
the
letter
back
but
stronger
fingers
than
hers
had
it
beyond
the
door
she
clutched
held
tight
then
she
heard
a
chuckle
and
found
herself
with
a
corner
of
the
envelope
in
her
hand
there
were
voices
outside
briggs
and
rudolph
guess
that
for
like
hell
it
she
ran
madly
up
the
stairs
again
and
tried
with
shaking
fingers
to
screw
the
into
place
again
she
fully
expected
that
they
would
kill
her
she
heard
briggs
go
out
and
after
a
time
she
heard
rudolph
trying
to
kick
in
the
house
door
then
when
the
last
screw
was
back
in
place
she
heard
herman
heavy
step
outside
and
voice
high
furious
and
insistent
had
herman
not
been
obsessed
with
the
thing
he
was
to
do
he
might
have
beaten
her
to
death
that
night
but
he
did
not
she
remained
in
her
room
without
food
or
water
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
kill
herself
with
the
knife
if
they
came
up
after
her
but
the
only
sounds
she
heard
were
of
high
voices
growing
lower
and
more
sinister
after
that
for
days
she
was
a
prisoner
herman
moved
his
bed
and
slept
in
the
the
five
or
six
hours
of
sleep
which
were
all
he
required
and
at
night
while
he
was
at
the
mill
rudolph
sat
and
dozed
and
kept
watch
below
twice
a
day
some
meager
provisions
were
left
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
her
door
was
unlocked
she
would
creep
out
and
get
them
not
because
she
was
hungry
but
because
she
meant
to
keep
up
her
strength
let
their
vigilance
slip
but
once
and
she
meant
to
be
ready
she
learned
to
interpret
every
sound
below
there
were
times
when
the
fumes
from
burning
food
came
up
the
staircase
and
almost
smothered
her
and
there
were
times
she
fancied
when
herman
weakened
and
rudolph
talked
for
hours
inciting
and
inflaming
him
again
she
gathered
too
that
gus
place
was
under
surveillance
and
more
than
once
in
the
middle
of
the
night
stealthy
figures
came
in
by
the
garden
gate
and
conferred
with
rudolph
then
one
evening
in
the
dusk
of
the
may
twilight
she
saw
three
of
them
come
one
rather
tall
and
military
of
figure
and
one
of
them
carried
very
carefully
a
cheap
suitcase
she
knew
what
was
in
that
suitcase
chapter
xxxviii
one
morning
in
his
mail
clayton
spencer
received
a
clipping
it
had
been
cut
from
a
society
journal
and
it
was
clamped
to
the
prospectus
of
a
firm
of
private
detectives
who
gave
information
for
divorce
cases
as
their
specialty
first
curiously
then
with
mounting
anger
clayton
read
that
the
wife
of
a
prominent
munition
manufacturer
was
being
seen
constantly
in
out
of
the
way
places
with
the
young
architect
who
was
building
a
palace
for
her
out
of
the
profiteer
new
wealth
it
is
quite
probable
ended
the
notice
that
the
episode
will
end
in
an
explosion
louder
than
the
best
shell
the
husband
in
the
case
ever
turned
clayton
did
not
believe
the
thing
for
a
moment
he
was
infuriated
but
mostly
with
the
journal
and
with
the
insulting
inference
of
the
prospectus
he
had
a
momentary
clear
vision
however
of
natalie
of
her
idle
days
of
perhaps
a
futile
last
clutch
at
youth
he
had
no
more
doubt
of
her
essential
integrity
than
of
his
own
but
he
had
a
very
distinct
feeling
that
she
had
exposed
his
name
to
cheap
scandal
and
that
for
nothing
had
there
been
anything
real
behind
it
he
might
have
understood
in
his
new
humility
in
his
new
knowledge
of
impulses
stronger
than
any
restraints
of
society
he
would
quite
certainly
have
made
every
allowance
but
for
a
whim
an
indulgence
of
her
incorrigible
vanity
to
get
along
to
save
natalie
herself
he
was
stifling
the
best
that
was
in
him
while
natalie
that
was
one
view
of
it
the
other
was
that
natalie
was
as
starved
as
he
was
if
he
got
nothing
from
her
he
gave
her
nothing
how
was
he
to
blame
her
she
was
straying
along
dangerous
paths
but
he
himself
had
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
precipice
and
looked
down
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
perhaps
for
once
natalie
was
in
earnest
perhaps
rodney
was
too
perhaps
each
of
them
had
at
last
found
something
that
loomed
larger
than
themselves
in
that
case
but
everything
he
knew
of
natalie
contradicted
that
she
was
not
a
woman
to
count
anything
well
lost
for
love
she
was
playing
with
his
honor
with
rodney
with
her
own
vanity
going
that
night
he
pondered
the
question
of
how
to
take
up
the
matter
with
her
it
would
be
absurd
under
the
circumstances
to
take
any
virtuous
attitude
he
was
still
undetermined
when
he
reached
the
house
he
found
marion
hayden
there
for
dinner
and
graham
and
a
spirited
discussion
going
on
which
ceased
when
he
stood
in
the
doorway
natalie
looked
irritated
graham
determined
and
marion
was
slightly
insolent
and
unusually
handsome
hurry
and
change
clay
natalie
said
dinner
is
as
he
went
away
he
had
again
the
feeling
of
being
shut
out
of
something
which
concerned
graham
dinner
was
difficult
natalie
was
obviously
sulking
and
graham
was
rather
taciturn
it
was
marion
who
kept
the
conversation
going
and
he
surmised
in
her
a
repressed
excitement
a
certain
triumph
at
last
natalie
roused
herself
the
meal
was
almost
over
and
the
servants
had
withdrawn
i
wish
you
would
talk
sense
to
graham
clay
she
said
fretfully
i
think
he
has
gone
i
do
call
it
going
mad
to
want
to
enlist
i
do
with
your
father
needing
you
and
with
all
the
men
there
are
who
can
i
do
understand
if
he
wants
to
enter
the
army
that
up
to
him
is
it
there
was
a
brief
silence
clayton
found
natalie
eyes
on
him
uneasy
resentful
that
just
it
i
promised
mother
not
to
unless
she
gives
her
consent
and
she
wo
give
i
certainly
will
clayton
saw
her
appealing
glance
at
marion
but
that
young
lady
was
lighting
a
cigaret
her
eyelids
lowered
he
felt
as
though
he
were
watching
a
play
in
which
he
was
the
audience
it
rather
a
family
affair
is
it
he
asked
suppose
we
wait
until
we
are
alone
after
all
there
is
no
marion
looked
at
him
and
he
caught
a
resentment
in
her
glance
the
two
glances
struck
fire
say
something
marion
natalie
implored
her
i
do
think
my
opinion
is
of
any
particular
importance
as
spencer
says
it
really
a
family
her
insolence
was
gone
marion
was
easy
she
knew
natalie
game
it
was
like
her
own
but
this
big
man
at
the
head
of
the
table
frightened
her
and
he
hated
her
he
hardly
troubled
to
hide
it
for
all
his
civility
even
that
civility
was
contemptuous
in
the
things
were
little
better
natalie
had
counted
on
marion
cooperation
and
she
had
failed
her
she
pleaded
a
headache
and
went
leaving
clayton
to
play
the
host
as
best
he
could
marion
wandered
into
the
with
its
bare
polished
floor
its
lovely
painted
piano
and
played
a
little
gay
charming
little
things
clever
and
artful
except
when
visitors
came
the
piano
was
never
touched
but
now
and
then
clayton
had
visualized
audrey
there
singing
in
her
husky
sweet
voice
her
little
french
songs
graham
moved
restlessly
about
the
room
and
clayton
felt
that
he
had
altered
lately
he
looked
older
and
not
happy
he
knew
the
boy
wanted
to
talk
about
natalie
opposition
but
was
hoping
that
he
would
broach
the
subject
and
clayton
rather
grimly
refused
to
do
it
those
next
weeks
would
show
how
much
of
the
man
there
was
in
graham
but
the
struggle
must
be
between
his
mother
and
himself
he
paused
finally
marion
was
singing
give
me
your
love
for
a
day
a
night
an
hour
if
the
wages
of
sin
are
death
i
willing
to
she
sang
it
in
her
clear
passionless
voice
brave
words
clayton
thought
but
there
were
few
who
would
pay
such
wages
this
girl
at
the
piano
what
did
she
know
of
the
thing
she
sang
about
what
did
any
of
the
young
know
they
always
construed
love
in
terms
of
passion
but
passion
was
ephemeral
love
lived
on
passion
took
but
love
gave
he
roused
himself
have
you
told
marion
about
the
new
arrangement
i
did
know
whether
you
cared
to
have
it
do
you
think
she
ought
to
know
if
she
intends
to
enter
the
family
she
has
a
right
to
know
that
she
is
not
marrying
into
great
wealth
i
do
suggest
he
added
as
graham
colored
hotly
that
it
will
make
any
difference
i
merely
feel
she
ought
to
know
your
he
was
called
to
the
telephone
and
when
he
came
back
he
found
them
in
earnest
conversation
the
girl
turned
toward
him
smiling
graham
has
just
told
me
you
are
splendid
and
afterward
clayton
was
forced
to
admit
an
element
of
sincerity
in
her
voice
she
had
had
a
disappointment
but
she
was
very
game
her
admiration
surprised
him
he
was
nearer
to
liking
her
than
he
had
ever
been
even
her
succeeding
words
did
not
quite
kill
his
admiration
for
her
and
i
have
told
graham
that
he
must
not
let
you
make
all
the
sacrifices
of
course
he
is
going
to
she
had
turned
her
defeat
into
a
triumph
against
natalie
clayton
knew
then
that
she
would
never
marry
graham
as
she
went
out
he
followed
her
with
a
faint
smile
of
tribute
the
smile
died
as
he
turned
to
go
up
the
stairs
natalie
was
in
her
she
had
not
undressed
but
was
standing
by
a
window
she
made
no
sign
that
she
heard
him
enter
and
he
hesitated
why
try
to
talk
things
out
with
her
why
hurt
her
why
not
let
things
drift
along
there
was
no
hope
of
bettering
them
one
of
two
things
he
must
do
either
tear
open
the
situation
between
them
or
ignore
it
can
i
get
anything
for
your
head
my
dear
i
have
any
then
i
think
i
go
to
bed
i
did
sleep
much
last
he
was
going
out
when
she
spoke
again
i
came
because
i
saw
how
things
were
do
you
really
want
to
go
into
that
why
not
we
have
to
go
into
it
soon
yet
when
she
turned
to
him
he
saw
the
real
distress
in
her
face
and
his
anger
died
i
did
want
to
hurt
you
natalie
i
honestly
tried
but
you
know
how
i
feel
about
that
even
the
servants
know
it
it
is
quite
we
parted
quite
i
dare
say
you
were
relieved
that
she
was
going
if
you
would
only
be
ordinarily
civil
to
her
oh
do
you
see
she
could
keep
graham
from
going
into
this
idiotic
war
you
ca
i
ca
i
tried
everything
i
know
and
she
knows
she
can
she
hateful
about
and
you
would
marry
him
to
that
sort
of
a
girl
i
keep
him
from
being
blinded
or
mutilated
or
being
you
can
kill
his
his
soul
she
burst
into
hysterical
laughter
you
to
talk
about
souls
that
that
natalie
he
was
very
grave
very
gentle
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
we
are
hitting
it
off
rather
badly
lately
she
looked
at
him
quickly
how
because
i
do
think
as
you
do
we
got
on
well
enough
before
this
war
came
do
you
think
it
is
only
that
if
it
the
house
just
remember
you
gave
me
carte
blanche
he
made
a
little
gesture
of
despair
i
just
thought
perhaps
you
are
not
as
happy
as
you
might
happiness
again
did
you
come
with
this
thing
hanging
over
us
to
talk
about
happiness
that
funny
but
her
eyes
were
suddenly
suspicious
there
was
something
strange
in
his
voice
let
forget
that
for
a
moment
graham
will
make
his
own
decision
but
before
we
leave
that
let
me
tell
you
that
i
love
him
as
much
as
you
do
his
going
means
exactly
as
much
it
only
another
point
we
differ
on
she
finished
for
him
go
on
you
are
suddenly
concerned
about
my
happiness
i
touched
clay
you
have
left
me
all
winter
to
go
out
alone
or
with
anybody
who
might
be
sorry
enough
for
me
to
pick
me
up
and
now
suddenly
her
eyes
sharpened
and
she
drew
her
breath
quickly
you
seen
that
scandalous
thing
in
the
paper
it
was
sent
to
who
sent
it
a
firm
of
private
she
was
frightened
and
the
terror
in
her
face
brought
him
to
her
quickly
natalie
do
look
like
that
i
do
believe
it
of
course
stupid
i
was
going
to
tell
you
you
do
think
i
believe
it
do
you
she
let
him
put
an
arm
around
her
and
hold
her
as
he
would
a
scared
child
there
was
no
love
for
her
in
it
but
a
great
pity
and
acute
remorse
that
he
could
hold
her
so
and
care
for
her
so
little
oh
clay
she
gasped
i
been
perfectly
sick
about
it
his
conviction
of
his
own
failure
to
her
made
him
very
tender
he
talked
to
her
as
she
stood
with
her
face
buried
in
the
shoulder
of
his
coat
of
the
absurdity
of
her
fear
of
his
own
understanding
and
when
she
was
calmer
he
made
a
futile
effort
to
make
his
position
clear
i
am
not
angry
he
said
and
i
not
fudging
you
in
any
way
but
you
know
how
things
are
between
us
we
have
been
drifting
apart
for
rather
a
long
time
it
not
your
fault
perhaps
it
is
mine
probably
it
is
i
know
i
do
make
you
happy
and
sometimes
i
think
things
have
either
got
to
be
better
or
if
i
willing
to
go
along
as
we
are
i
think
you
should
then
let
try
to
get
a
little
happiness
out
of
it
all
oh
happiness
you
are
always
raving
about
happiness
there
is
any
such
peace
then
let
have
peace
she
drew
back
regarding
him
what
did
you
mean
by
things
having
to
be
better
or
worse
when
he
found
no
immediate
answer
she
was
uneasy
the
prospect
of
any
change
in
their
relationship
frightened
her
like
all
weak
women
she
was
afraid
of
change
her
life
suited
her
even
her
misery
she
loved
and
fed
on
she
had
pitied
herself
always
not
love
but
fear
of
change
lay
behind
her
shallow
anxious
eyes
yet
he
could
not
hurt
her
she
had
been
foolish
but
she
had
not
been
wicked
in
his
new
humility
he
found
her
infinitely
better
than
himself
i
spoke
without
then
it
must
have
been
in
your
mind
let
me
see
the
clipping
clay
i
tried
to
forget
what
it
she
took
it
still
pinned
to
the
prospectus
and
bent
over
them
both
when
she
had
examined
them
she
continued
to
stand
with
lowered
eyelids
turning
and
crumpling
them
then
she
looked
up
so
that
is
what
you
meant
it
was
a
well
a
sort
of
a
i
had
no
intention
of
threatening
you
my
dear
you
ought
to
know
me
better
that
clipping
was
sent
me
attached
to
the
slip
the
only
reason
i
let
you
see
it
was
because
i
think
you
ought
to
know
how
the
most
innocent
things
are
you
could
divorce
me
if
you
wanted
then
her
defiance
faded
in
a
weak
terror
she
began
to
cry
shameless
frightened
tears
that
rolled
down
her
cheeks
she
reminded
him
that
she
was
the
mother
of
his
child
that
she
had
sacrificed
her
life
to
both
of
them
and
that
now
they
would
both
leave
her
and
turn
her
adrift
she
had
served
her
purpose
now
let
her
go
utter
hopelessness
kept
him
dumb
he
knew
of
old
that
she
would
cry
until
she
was
ready
to
stop
or
until
she
had
gained
her
point
and
he
knew
too
that
she
expected
him
to
put
his
arms
around
her
again
in
token
of
his
complete
surrender
the
very
fact
hardened
him
he
did
not
want
to
put
his
arms
around
her
he
wanted
indeed
to
get
out
into
the
open
air
and
walk
off
his
exasperation
the
scent
in
the
room
stifled
him
when
he
made
no
move
toward
her
she
gradually
stopped
crying
and
gave
way
to
the
rage
that
was
often
behind
her
tears
just
try
to
divorce
me
and
see
good
god
i
have
even
mentioned
divorce
i
only
said
we
must
try
to
get
along
better
to
which
means
i
dare
say
that
i
am
to
agree
with
you
but
she
had
one
weapon
still
suddenly
she
smiled
a
little
wistfully
and
made
the
apparently
complete
surrender
that
always
disarmed
him
i
be
good
from
now
on
clay
i
be
very
very
good
only
do
be
always
criticizing
she
held
up
her
lips
and
after
a
second
hesitation
he
kissed
her
he
knew
he
was
precisely
where
he
had
been
when
he
started
and
he
had
a
hopeless
sense
of
the
futility
of
the
effort
he
had
made
natalie
had
got
by
with
a
bad
and
would
proceed
to
forget
it
as
quickly
as
she
always
forgot
anything
disagreeable
still
she
was
in
a
more
receptive
mood
than
usual
and
he
wondered
if
that
would
not
be
as
good
a
time
as
any
to
speak
about
his
new
plan
as
to
the
mill
he
took
an
uneasy
turn
or
two
about
the
room
feeling
her
eyes
on
him
there
is
something
else
she
had
relaxed
like
a
kitten
in
her
big
chair
and
was
lighting
one
of
the
small
cigarets
she
affected
about
graham
it
affects
graham
it
affects
us
yes
he
hesitated
to
talk
to
natalie
about
business
meant
reducing
it
to
its
most
elemental
form
have
you
ever
thought
that
this
war
of
ours
means
more
than
merely
raising
armies
i
have
thought
about
this
war
at
all
it
too
absurd
a
lot
of
politicians
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
it
means
a
great
deal
of
the
country
is
rich
is
it
the
country
that
means
the
i
knew
we
get
to
money
sooner
or
later
she
observed
resignedly
all
right
we
be
taxed
so
we
cut
down
on
the
country
house
go
on
i
can
say
it
before
you
do
but
do
say
we
have
to
do
without
the
greenhouses
because
we
we
may
have
to
go
without
more
than
his
tone
made
her
sit
bolt
upright
then
she
laughed
a
little
poor
old
clay
she
said
with
the
caressing
tone
she
used
when
she
meant
to
make
no
concession
i
do
spend
money
do
i
but
i
do
make
you
comfortable
you
know
and
what
is
what
i
spend
compared
with
what
you
are
making
it
just
that
i
do
think
i
can
consistently
go
on
making
a
profit
on
this
war
now
that
we
are
in
he
explained
then
what
he
meant
and
watched
her
face
set
into
the
hard
lines
he
knew
so
well
but
she
listened
to
the
end
and
when
he
had
finished
she
said
nothing
well
he
said
i
do
think
you
have
the
remotest
idea
of
doing
it
you
like
to
play
at
the
heroic
you
can
see
yourself
doing
it
and
every
one
pointing
to
you
as
the
man
who
threw
away
a
fortune
but
you
are
humbugging
yourself
you
never
do
it
i
give
you
credit
for
too
much
he
went
rather
white
she
knew
the
weakness
in
his
armor
his
hatred
of
anything
theatrical
and
with
unfailing
accuracy
she
always
pierced
it
suppose
i
tell
you
i
have
already
offered
the
plant
to
the
government
at
a
nominal
suddenly
she
got
up
and
every
vestige
of
softness
was
gone
i
do
think
you
would
be
such
a
i
have
done
then
you
are
insane
there
is
no
other
possible
she
passed
him
moving
swiftly
and
went
into
her
bedroom
he
heard
her
lock
the
door
behind
her
chapter
xxxix
audrey
had
made
a
resolution
and
with
characteristic
energy
had
proceeded
to
carry
it
out
she
was
no
longer
needed
at
the
recruiting
stations
after
a
month
debate
the
conscription
law
was
about
to
be
passed
made
certain
by
the
frank
statement
of
the
british
commission
under
balfour
as
to
the
urgency
of
the
need
of
a
vast
new
army
in
france
for
the
first
time
the
allies
laid
their
cards
face
up
on
the
table
and
america
realized
to
what
she
was
committed
almost
overnight
a
potential
army
of
hundreds
of
thousands
was
changing
to
one
of
millions
the
situation
was
desperate
germany
had
more
men
than
the
allies
and
had
vast
eastern
resources
to
draw
on
for
still
more
to
the
allies
only
the
untapped
resources
of
america
remained
in
private
conference
with
the
president
balfour
had
urged
haste
and
yet
more
haste
audrey
reading
her
newspapers
faithfully
felt
with
her
exaltation
a
little
stirring
of
regret
her
occupation
such
as
it
was
was
gone
for
the
thin
stream
of
men
flowing
toward
the
recruiting
stations
there
was
now
to
be
a
vast
movement
of
the
young
manhood
of
the
nation
and
she
could
have
no
place
in
it
almost
immediately
she
set
to
work
to
find
herself
a
new
place
at
first
there
seemed
to
be
none
she
went
to
a
hospital
and
offered
her
strong
body
and
her
two
willing
hands
for
training
i
could
learn
quickly
she
pleaded
and
surely
there
will
not
be
enough
nurses
for
such
an
army
as
we
are
to
our
regular
course
is
three
but
a
special
course
surely
i
may
have
that
there
are
so
many
things
one
wo
need
in
the
head
of
the
training
school
smiled
rather
wistfully
they
came
to
her
so
often
now
these
intelligent
untrained
women
all
eagerness
to
help
to
forget
and
unlive
if
they
could
their
wasted
lives
you
want
to
go
to
france
of
course
if
i
can
my
husband
was
killed
over
but
she
did
not
intend
to
make
capital
of
chris
death
of
course
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
going
i
simply
want
to
it
hard
work
not
i
am
not
looking
for
in
the
end
however
she
had
to
give
it
up
in
some
hospitals
they
were
already
training
nurses
helpers
but
they
were
to
relieve
trained
women
for
france
she
went
home
to
think
it
over
she
had
felt
that
by
leaving
the
country
she
would
solve
clayton
problem
and
her
own
to
stay
on
seeing
him
now
and
then
was
torture
for
them
both
but
there
was
something
else
she
had
begun
that
afternoon
to
doubt
whether
she
was
fitted
for
nursing
after
all
the
quiet
of
the
hospital
the
odor
of
drugs
the
subdued
voice
and
quiet
eyes
of
the
head
of
the
training
school
as
of
one
who
had
looked
on
life
and
found
it
infinitely
sad
depressed
her
she
had
walked
home
impatient
with
herself
disappointed
in
her
own
failure
she
thought
dismally
i
am
of
no
earthly
use
i
played
all
my
life
and
now
i
paying
for
it
i
ought
and
she
ran
over
her
pitiful
accomplishments
golf
bridge
ride
shoot
swim
sing
a
little
dance
tennis
some
french
what
a
sickening
list
she
was
glad
that
day
to
find
clare
gould
waiting
for
her
as
usual
the
girl
had
brought
her
tribute
this
time
some
early
strawberries
audrey
found
her
in
the
pantry
arranging
their
leaves
in
a
shallow
dish
clare
she
said
are
you
working
i
gone
on
the
girl
admiration
salved
her
wounded
pride
in
herself
then
she
saw
on
a
table
an
envelope
with
her
name
on
it
clare
eyes
followed
hers
that
the
rest
of
the
money
she
colored
but
audrey
only
smiled
at
her
fine
she
said
are
you
sure
you
can
spare
it
i
could
rest
until
it
was
all
paid
up
and
i
getting
along
fine
i
make
a
lot
tell
me
about
the
night
we
gone
on
double
turn
i
rather
like
it
at
night
it
well
like
something
on
the
stage
the
sparks
fly
from
the
lathes
and
they
look
like
fireworks
and
when
they
hammer
on
hot
metal
it
she
talked
on
incoherent
but
glowing
she
liked
her
big
turret
lathe
it
gave
her
a
sense
of
power
she
liked
to
see
the
rough
metal
growing
smooth
and
shining
like
silver
under
her
hands
she
was
naively
pleased
that
she
was
doing
a
man
work
and
doing
it
well
audrey
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
listened
all
this
that
clare
was
talking
about
was
clayton
doing
he
at
least
had
dreamed
true
he
was
doing
a
man
part
too
in
the
war
even
this
girl
whose
hand
natalie
spencer
would
not
have
touched
this
girl
was
dreaming
true
clare
was
still
talking
the
draft
would
be
hard
on
the
plant
they
were
now
there
was
talk
of
taking
in
more
girls
to
replace
the
men
who
would
be
called
do
you
think
i
could
operate
a
lathe
clare
you
why
valentine
it
not
work
for
a
lady
look
at
my
but
audrey
made
an
impatient
gesture
i
do
care
about
my
hands
the
question
is
could
i
do
it
i
seem
able
to
do
anything
why
clare
was
reluctant
i
can
and
you
a
lot
cleverer
than
i
am
but
it
hard
it
rough
and
some
of
the
talk
oh
i
hope
you
do
mean
it
audrey
however
was
meaning
it
it
seemed
to
her
all
at
once
the
way
out
here
was
work
needed
work
work
that
she
could
do
for
the
first
time
in
months
she
blessed
the
golf
and
riding
that
had
kept
her
fit
mr
spencer
is
a
friend
of
yours
he
never
let
you
do
he
is
not
to
know
clare
audrey
said
briskly
you
are
quite
right
he
would
probably
be
very
mannish
about
it
so
we
wo
tell
him
and
now
how
shall
i
go
about
getting
in
will
they
teach
me
or
shall
i
have
to
lust
learn
and
whatever
shall
i
wear
clare
explained
while
for
she
was
determined
not
to
lose
a
minute
audrey
changed
into
her
plainest
clothes
they
would
be
in
time
if
they
hurried
before
the
employment
department
closed
there
were
women
in
charge
there
they
you
and
then
you
were
investigated
by
the
secret
service
and
if
you
were
all
right
well
that
was
all
mercy
it
enough
said
audrey
impatiently
do
you
mean
to
say
they
come
here
she
glanced
around
her
rooms
littered
with
photographs
of
people
well
known
to
the
public
through
the
society
journals
with
its
high
bright
silver
vases
its
odd
gifts
of
porcelain
its
grand
piano
taking
up
more
than
its
share
of
room
if
they
come
here
she
deliberated
they
wo
take
me
clare
they
be
thinking
i
living
on
german
money
so
in
the
end
she
did
not
go
to
the
munition
works
she
went
instead
with
clare
beside
her
very
uncomfortable
on
the
street
for
fear
audrey
would
be
compromised
by
walking
with
her
and
at
six
that
evening
a
young
woman
with
a
softly
inflected
voice
and
an
air
of
almost
humorous
enjoyment
of
something
the
landlady
failed
to
grasp
was
the
tenant
for
one
month
rent
in
advance
of
a
room
on
south
perry
street
clare
was
almost
in
tears
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
your
sleeping
in
that
bed
valentine
she
protested
it
dips
down
i
sha
have
much
time
to
sleep
anyhow
and
when
i
do
so
i
shall
be
so
tired
was
the
name
i
gave
her
clare
thompson
mary
she
surprised
me
or
i
have
thought
of
a
prettier
she
was
absurdly
although
the
next
day
ordeal
rather
worried
her
when
she
thought
about
it
she
had
oddly
enough
no
trepidation
about
the
work
itself
it
was
passing
the
detectives
in
the
employment
department
that
worried
her
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
there
was
no
ordeal
her
card
was
carried
to
the
desk
in
the
corner
where
the
two
men
sat
on
whose
decisions
might
so
easily
rest
the
safety
of
the
entire
plant
and
they
surveyed
her
carefully
audrey
looked
ahead
and
waited
they
would
come
over
and
question
her
and
the
whole
fabric
she
had
built
would
be
destroyed
but
nothing
happened
she
was
told
she
would
be
notified
in
a
day
or
two
if
she
would
be
taken
on
and
with
that
she
was
forced
to
be
content
she
had
a
bad
moment
however
for
graham
came
through
the
office
on
his
way
out
and
stopped
for
a
moment
directly
in
front
of
her
her
heart
almost
stopped
beating
and
she
dropped
her
glove
and
stooped
to
pick
it
up
when
she
sat
erect
again
he
was
moving
on
but
even
her
brief
glance
had
showed
her
that
the
boy
looked
tired
and
depressed
she
went
to
her
rented
room
at
once
for
she
must
be
prepared
for
inquiries
about
her
during
the
interval
she
arranged
for
the
closing
of
her
apartment
and
the
storing
of
her
furniture
with
their
going
would
depart
the
last
reminders
of
the
old
life
and
she
felt
a
curious
sense
of
relief
they
had
little
happiness
to
remind
her
of
and
much
suffering
the
world
had
changed
since
she
had
gathered
them
together
and
she
had
changed
with
it
she
was
older
and
sadder
but
she
would
not
have
gone
back
not
for
anything
would
she
have
gone
back
she
had
one
thing
to
do
however
before
she
disappeared
she
had
promised
to
try
to
find
something
for
delight
and
she
did
it
with
her
usual
thoroughness
and
dispatch
she
sent
for
her
that
last
day
in
the
apartment
when
in
the
morning
she
had
found
at
the
perry
street
room
a
card
telling
her
to
report
the
following
night
when
delight
came
in
she
found
the
little
apartment
rather
bare
and
rather
dreary
but
audrey
was
cheerful
almost
gay
going
away
for
a
little
while
she
explained
i
stored
a
lot
of
stuff
and
now
my
dear
do
you
really
want
to
work
i
just
must
do
all
right
that
settled
i
got
the
thing
i
spoke
about
in
one
of
the
officers
but
remember
delight
this
is
not
going
to
be
a
romantic
adventure
it
to
be
i
do
want
a
romantic
adventure
poor
little
thing
audrey
reflected
to
herself
and
aloud
good
of
course
i
know
you
sincere
about
working
i
i
understand
awfully
delight
was
pleased
but
audrey
saw
that
she
was
not
happy
even
when
the
details
had
been
arranged
she
still
sat
in
her
straight
chair
and
made
no
move
to
go
and
audrey
felt
that
the
next
move
was
up
to
her
what
the
news
about
graham
spencer
she
inquired
he
be
drafted
i
not
if
they
claim
exemption
he
making
shells
you
she
lifted
rather
heavy
eyes
to
audrey
his
mother
is
trying
that
now
she
said
ever
since
his
engagement
was
broken
oh
it
was
broken
was
it
yes
i
do
know
why
but
it
off
anyhow
spencer
is
telling
everybody
he
ca
be
and
his
father
i
do
know
he
does
talk
about
it
i
perhaps
he
wants
him
to
make
his
own
delight
rose
and
drew
down
her
veil
with
hands
that
audrey
saw
were
trembling
a
little
how
can
he
make
his
own
decision
she
asked
he
may
think
it
his
own
but
it
hers
spencer
she
always
talking
always
and
she
plausible
she
can
make
him
think
black
is
white
if
she
wants
why
do
you
talk
to
him
i
he
think
i
lost
my
mind
besides
that
is
it
if
you
like
a
man
you
want
him
to
do
the
right
thing
because
he
wants
to
not
because
a
girl
asks
him
i
wonder
audrey
said
slowly
if
he
worth
it
delight
worth
what
she
was
startled
worth
your
worth
our
worrying
about
but
she
did
not
need
delight
hasty
and
flushed
championship
of
graham
to
tell
her
what
she
already
knew
after
she
had
gone
audrey
sat
alone
in
her
empty
rooms
and
faced
a
great
temptation
she
was
taking
herself
out
of
clayton
life
she
knew
that
she
would
be
as
lost
to
him
among
the
thousands
of
workers
in
the
munition
plant
as
she
would
have
been
in
russia
according
to
clare
he
rarely
went
into
the
shops
themselves
and
never
at
night
of
course
out
of
his
life
was
a
phrase
they
would
meet
again
but
not
now
not
until
they
had
had
time
to
become
resigned
to
what
they
had
already
accepted
the
war
would
not
last
forever
and
then
she
thought
of
their
love
which
had
been
born
and
had
grown
always
with
war
at
its
background
they
had
gone
along
well
enough
until
this
winter
and
then
everything
had
changed
chris
natalie
clayton
herself
none
of
them
were
quite
what
they
had
been
was
that
one
of
the
gains
of
war
that
sham
fell
away
and
people
revealed
either
the
best
or
the
worst
in
them
war
destroyed
but
it
also
revealed
the
temptation
was
to
hear
clayton
voice
again
she
went
to
the
telephone
and
stood
with
the
instrument
in
her
hands
thinking
would
it
comfort
him
or
would
it
only
bring
her
close
for
a
moment
to
emphasize
her
coming
silence
she
put
it
down
and
turned
away
when
some
time
later
the
taxicab
came
to
take
her
to
perry
street
she
was
lying
on
her
bed
in
the
dusk
and
arms
outstretched
a
lonely
and
pathetic
figure
all
her
courage
dead
for
the
moment
dead
but
for
the
desire
to
hear
voice
again
before
the
silence
closed
down
she
got
up
and
pinned
on
her
hat
for
the
last
time
before
the
mirror
of
the
little
inlaid
and
she
smiled
rather
forlornly
at
her
reflection
in
the
glass
well
i
got
the
present
anyhow
she
considered
i
not
going
either
to
wallow
in
the
past
or
peer
into
the
future
i
going
to
the
prospect
cheered
her
after
all
work
was
the
great
solution
it
was
the
great
healer
too
that
was
why
men
bore
their
griefs
better
than
women
they
could
work
she
took
a
final
glance
around
her
stripped
and
cheerless
rooms
how
really
little
things
mattered
all
her
life
she
had
been
burdened
with
things
now
at
last
she
was
free
of
them
the
shabby
room
on
perry
street
called
her
work
called
beckoned
to
her
with
calloused
useful
hands
she
closed
and
locked
the
door
and
went
quietly
down
the
stairs
chapter
xl
one
day
late
in
may
clayton
walking
in
lieu
of
the
golf
he
had
been
forced
to
abandon
met
doctor
haverford
on
the
street
and
found
his
way
barred
by
that
rather
gentleman
i
was
just
going
to
see
you
clayton
he
said
about
two
things
walk
back
a
few
blocks
with
he
was
excited
rather
exalted
i
going
in
he
announced
regimental
chaplain
i
got
a
leave
of
absence
i
rather
vague
about
what
a
chaplain
does
but
i
rather
fancy
he
can
be
you
get
over
of
course
you
lucky
and
you
find
plenty
to
i
been
rather
anxious
doctor
haverford
confided
i
been
a
clergyman
so
long
that
i
do
know
just
how
i
measure
up
as
a
man
you
know
what
i
mean
i
am
making
no
reflection
on
the
church
but
been
sheltered
and
well
i
been
looked
after
i
do
think
i
am
physically
brave
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
he
said
wryly
if
the
chaplain
were
to
turn
and
run
under
fire
i
should
worry
about
my
salary
is
to
go
on
but
i
do
like
that
either
if
i
had
a
family
i
would
accept
it
delight
thinks
i
should
anyhow
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
ought
to
be
no
measures
about
our
giving
ourselves
if
i
had
a
son
to
give
it
would
be
clayton
looked
straight
ahead
he
knew
that
the
rector
had
for
the
moment
forgotten
that
he
had
a
son
to
give
and
that
he
had
not
yet
given
why
do
you
accept
a
small
allowance
he
inquired
quietly
or
better
still
why
do
you
let
me
know
how
much
it
will
take
and
let
me
do
it
i
like
to
feel
that
i
was
represented
in
france
by
you
he
added
and
suddenly
the
rector
remembered
he
was
most
uncomfortable
and
very
flushed
thanks
i
ca
let
you
do
that
of
why
not
because
hang
it
all
clayton
i
not
a
parasite
i
took
the
car
because
it
enabled
me
to
do
my
parish
work
better
but
i
not
going
to
run
off
to
war
and
let
you
keep
my
clayton
glanced
at
him
at
his
fine
erect
old
figure
his
warmly
flushed
face
war
did
strange
things
there
was
a
new
light
in
the
rector
once
worldly
if
kindly
eyes
he
had
the
strained
look
of
a
man
who
sees
great
things
as
yet
far
away
and
who
would
hasten
toward
them
insensibly
he
quickened
his
pace
but
i
ca
go
myself
so
why
ca
i
send
a
proxy
clayton
asked
smiling
i
an
idea
i
be
well
that
a
fine
way
to
look
at
it
but
i
ca
do
it
i
saved
something
not
much
but
it
will
do
for
a
year
or
two
i
glad
you
made
the
offer
though
it
was
like
you
and
it
showed
me
the
way
i
let
any
man
or
any
group
of
men
finance
my
and
he
stuck
to
it
clayton
having
in
mind
those
careful
canvasses
of
the
congregation
of
saint
luke
which
had
every
few
years
resulted
in
raising
the
rector
salary
was
surprised
and
touched
after
all
war
was
like
any
other
grief
it
brought
out
the
best
or
the
worst
in
us
it
roused
or
it
crushed
us
the
rector
had
been
thinking
i
a
very
fortunate
man
he
said
suddenly
they
standing
squarely
behind
me
at
home
it
the
women
behind
the
army
that
will
make
it
count
clayton
said
nothing
which
reminds
me
went
on
the
rector
that
i
find
valentine
has
gone
away
i
called
on
her
and
she
has
given
up
her
apartment
do
you
happen
to
know
where
she
is
she
has
left
no
gone
away
clayton
repeated
why
no
i
had
heard
of
there
in
the
busy
street
he
felt
a
strange
sense
of
loneliness
always
although
he
did
not
see
her
he
felt
her
presence
she
walked
the
same
streets
for
the
calling
if
his
extremity
became
too
great
he
could
hear
her
voice
over
the
telephone
there
was
always
the
hope
too
of
meeting
her
not
by
design
she
had
forbidden
that
but
some
times
perhaps
god
would
be
good
to
them
both
if
they
earned
it
and
they
could
touch
hands
for
a
moment
but
gone
you
are
certain
she
left
no
address
quite
certain
she
has
stored
her
furniture
i
there
was
a
sense
of
hurt
then
too
she
had
made
this
decision
without
telling
him
it
seemed
incredible
a
dozen
decisions
a
day
he
made
and
when
they
were
vital
there
was
always
in
his
mind
the
question
as
to
whether
she
would
approve
or
not
he
could
not
go
to
her
with
them
but
mentally
he
was
always
consulting
with
her
earning
her
approbation
and
she
had
gone
without
a
word
do
you
think
she
has
gone
to
france
he
knew
his
voice
sounded
stiff
and
constrained
i
hope
not
she
was
being
so
useful
here
of
course
the
draft
law
amazing
thing
the
draft
law
never
thought
we
come
to
it
but
it
threw
her
out
in
a
way
of
what
has
the
draft
law
to
do
with
valentine
why
you
know
what
she
was
doing
do
you
i
have
seen
her
the
rector
well
he
said
let
me
tell
you
clayton
that
that
girl
has
been
recruiting
men
night
after
night
and
day
after
day
she
done
wonders
standing
in
a
wagon
mind
you
in
the
slums
or
anywhere
i
heard
her
one
night
by
george
i
went
home
and
tore
up
a
sermon
i
had
been
working
on
for
why
had
he
known
why
had
he
realized
that
that
was
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
she
would
do
there
was
bitterness
in
his
heart
too
he
might
easily
have
stood
unseen
in
the
crowd
and
have
watched
and
listened
and
been
proud
of
her
then
these
last
weeks
when
he
had
been
working
or
dining
out
or
sitting
dreary
and
bored
in
a
theater
she
had
been
out
in
the
streets
ah
she
lived
did
audrey
others
worked
and
played
but
she
lived
audrey
audrey
in
the
rain
the
rector
was
saying
but
she
did
mind
it
i
remember
her
saying
to
the
crowd
raining
over
here
and
maybe
it
raining
on
the
fellows
in
the
trenches
but
i
tell
you
i
rather
be
over
there
up
to
my
waist
in
mud
and
water
than
scurrying
for
a
doorway
here
they
had
started
to
run
out
of
the
shower
but
at
that
they
grinned
and
stopped
she
was
wonderful
in
the
rain
and
after
it
was
over
she
would
go
home
in
some
crowded
bus
or
car
to
her
lonely
rooms
while
he
rolled
about
the
city
in
a
limousine
it
was
cruel
of
her
not
to
have
told
him
not
to
have
allowed
him
at
least
to
see
that
she
was
warm
and
dry
i
been
very
busy
i
had
heard
he
said
slowly
is
it
was
it
generally
known
had
natalie
known
and
kept
it
from
him
i
think
not
delight
saw
her
and
spoke
to
her
i
and
you
have
no
idea
where
she
is
none
he
learned
that
night
that
natalie
had
known
and
he
surprised
a
little
uneasiness
in
her
face
i
heard
about
it
she
said
i
ca
imagine
her
making
a
speech
she
not
a
bit
we
might
have
sent
out
one
of
the
cars
for
her
if
i
oh
she
was
looked
after
well
looked
after
natalie
had
made
an
error
and
knew
it
i
heard
that
a
young
clergyman
was
taking
her
round
she
said
and
changed
the
subject
but
he
knew
that
she
was
either
lying
or
keeping
something
from
him
in
those
days
of
tension
he
found
her
more
irritating
than
her
rather
childish
falsehoods
in
spite
of
himself
however
the
thought
of
the
young
clergyman
rankled
that
night
stretched
in
the
low
chair
in
his
under
the
reading
light
he
thought
over
things
carefully
if
he
loved
her
as
he
thought
he
did
he
ought
to
want
her
to
be
happy
things
between
them
were
hopeless
and
wretched
if
this
clergyman
or
sloane
or
any
other
man
loved
her
and
he
groaned
as
he
thought
how
lovable
she
was
then
why
not
want
for
her
such
happiness
as
she
could
find
he
slept
badly
that
night
and
for
some
reason
audrey
wove
herself
into
his
dreams
of
the
new
plant
the
roar
of
the
machinery
took
on
the
soft
huskiness
of
her
voice
the
deeper
note
he
watched
for
and
loved
chapter
xli
anna
klein
stood
in
her
small
room
and
covered
her
mouth
with
her
hands
lest
she
shriek
aloud
she
knew
quite
well
that
the
bomb
in
the
would
not
suffice
to
blow
up
the
whole
great
plant
but
she
knew
what
the
result
of
its
explosion
would
be
the
shells
were
not
loaded
at
the
spencer
plant
they
were
shipped
away
for
that
but
the
fuses
were
loaded
there
and
in
the
small
brick
house
at
the
end
of
the
fuse
building
there
were
stored
masses
of
explosive
enough
to
destroy
a
town
it
was
there
of
course
that
herman
was
to
place
the
bomb
she
knew
how
he
would
do
it
carefully
methodically
and
with
what
a
lumbering
awkward
gait
he
would
make
his
escape
her
whole
mind
was
bent
on
giving
the
alarm
on
escaping
first
and
then
on
arousing
the
plant
but
when
the
voices
below
continued
long
after
herman
had
gone
she
was
entirely
desperate
herman
had
not
carried
out
the
he
had
looked
indeed
much
as
usual
as
he
walked
out
the
garden
path
and
closed
the
gate
behind
him
he
had
walked
rather
slowly
but
then
he
always
walked
slowly
she
seemed
to
see
however
a
new
caution
in
his
gait
as
of
one
who
dreaded
to
stumble
she
dressed
herself
with
shaking
fingers
and
pinned
on
her
hat
the
voices
still
went
on
below
monotonous
endless
the
rasping
of
rudolph
throat
irritated
by
cheap
cigarets
the
sound
of
glasses
on
the
table
once
a
laugh
guttural
and
mirthless
it
was
ten
when
she
knew
by
the
pushing
back
of
their
chairs
that
they
were
preparing
to
depart
ten
she
was
about
to
commence
again
the
feverish
unscrewing
of
the
door
hinges
when
she
heard
rudolph
step
on
the
stairs
she
had
only
time
to
get
to
the
back
of
her
room
beside
the
bed
when
she
heard
him
try
the
knob
anna
she
let
him
call
her
again
anna
what
is
it
you
in
bed
yes
go
away
and
let
me
alone
i
got
a
right
to
sleep
i
going
out
but
i
be
back
in
ten
minutes
you
try
any
tricks
and
i
get
you
see
you
make
me
sick
she
retorted
she
heard
him
turn
and
run
lightly
down
the
stairs
only
when
she
heard
the
click
of
the
gate
did
she
dare
to
begin
again
at
the
door
she
got
easily
but
she
was
still
a
prisoner
however
she
found
the
high
little
window
into
the
open
and
crawled
through
it
to
stand
listening
the
street
was
quiet
once
outside
the
yard
she
started
to
run
they
would
let
her
telephone
from
the
even
without
money
she
had
no
money
but
the
was
closed
and
dark
and
the
threat
of
rudolph
return
terrified
her
she
must
get
off
the
hill
somehow
there
were
still
paths
down
the
steep
dangerous
things
that
hugged
the
edge
of
small
rocky
precipices
or
sloped
steeply
to
sudden
turns
but
she
had
played
over
the
hill
all
her
young
life
she
plunged
down
slipping
and
falling
a
dozen
times
and
muttering
some
times
an
oath
some
times
a
prayer
oh
god
let
me
be
in
time
oh
god
hold
him
up
a
while
until
i
then
a
slip
if
i
fall
now
only
when
she
was
down
in
the
mill
district
did
she
try
to
make
any
plan
it
was
almost
eleven
then
and
her
ears
were
tense
with
listening
for
the
sound
she
dreaded
she
faced
her
situation
then
she
could
not
telephone
from
a
private
house
either
to
the
mill
or
to
the
spencer
house
what
she
feared
and
the
of
the
telephone
company
demanded
cash
in
advance
she
was
incapable
of
clear
thought
or
she
would
have
found
some
way
out
undoubtedly
what
she
did
in
the
end
was
to
board
an
car
and
throw
herself
on
the
mercy
of
the
conductor
i
got
to
get
she
panted
i
not
go
in
see
i
stand
here
and
you
take
me
as
far
as
you
can
look
at
me
i
do
look
as
though
i
just
bumming
a
ride
do
i
the
conductor
hesitated
he
had
very
little
faith
in
human
nature
but
anna
eyes
were
both
truthful
and
desperate
he
gave
the
signal
to
go
on
what
up
he
said
police
after
you
yes
anna
replied
briefly
there
is
in
certain
ranks
a
tacit
conspiracy
against
the
police
the
conductor
hated
them
they
rode
free
on
his
car
and
sometimes
kept
an
eye
on
him
in
the
rush
hours
they
had
a
way
too
of
letting
him
settle
his
own
disputes
with
inebriated
gentlemen
who
refused
to
pay
their
fares
looks
as
though
they
come
pretty
close
to
grabbing
you
he
opened
by
way
of
conversation
but
ten
of
are
a
match
for
one
smart
girl
they
ca
run
all
got
flat
anna
nodded
she
was
faint
and
dizzy
and
the
car
seemed
to
creep
along
it
was
twenty
minutes
after
eleven
when
she
got
out
the
conductor
leaned
down
after
her
hanging
to
the
handrail
good
luck
to
you
he
said
and
you
better
get
a
better
face
on
you
than
that
it
enough
to
send
you
up
on
suspicion
she
hardly
heard
him
she
began
to
run
and
again
she
said
over
and
over
her
little
inarticulate
prayer
she
knew
the
spencer
house
more
than
once
she
had
walked
past
it
on
sunday
afternoons
for
the
sheer
pleasure
of
seeing
graham
home
well
all
that
was
over
now
everything
was
over
unless
the
spencer
house
was
dark
save
for
a
low
light
in
the
hall
a
new
terror
seized
her
suppose
graham
saw
her
he
might
not
believe
her
story
he
might
think
it
a
ruse
to
see
his
father
but
as
it
happened
clayton
had
sent
the
butler
to
bed
and
himself
answered
the
bell
from
the
library
he
recognized
her
at
once
and
because
he
saw
the
distress
on
her
face
he
brought
her
in
at
once
in
the
brief
moment
that
it
required
to
turn
on
the
lights
he
had
jumped
to
a
sickening
conviction
that
graham
was
at
the
bottom
of
her
visit
and
her
appearance
in
full
light
confirmed
this
come
into
the
library
he
said
we
can
talk
in
he
led
the
way
and
drew
up
a
chair
for
her
but
she
did
not
sit
down
she
steadied
herself
by
its
back
instead
you
think
it
about
graham
she
began
it
is
not
directly
that
is
and
my
coming
is
terrible
because
it
my
own
father
they
going
to
blow
up
the
munition
plant
spencer
when
i
think
i
came
as
fast
as
i
could
i
was
locked
in
locked
in
he
was
studying
her
face
yes
do
bother
about
that
now
i
not
crazy
or
hysterical
i
tell
you
i
heard
them
i
been
a
prisoner
or
i
have
come
sooner
they
brought
something
dynamite
or
a
bomb
in
a
and
gone
he
took
it
my
he
was
already
at
the
telephone
as
she
spoke
he
called
the
mill
first
and
got
the
night
superintendent
then
he
called
a
number
anna
supposed
was
the
police
station
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
ringing
the
steadily
for
his
car
by
the
time
he
had
explained
the
situation
to
the
police
his
car
was
rolling
under
the
beside
the
house
he
was
starting
out
forgetful
of
the
girl
when
she
caught
him
by
the
arm
you
must
go
she
cried
you
be
killed
too
it
will
all
go
all
of
it
you
ca
be
spared
spencer
you
can
build
another
mill
but
he
shook
her
off
gently
of
course
i
going
he
said
we
get
it
in
time
do
you
worry
you
sit
down
here
and
rest
and
when
it
all
straightened
out
i
come
back
i
suppose
you
ca
go
home
after
this
no
she
said
dully
he
ran
out
hatless
and
a
moment
later
she
heard
the
car
rush
out
into
the
night
five
minutes
passed
ten
anna
klein
stood
staring
ahead
of
her
when
nothing
happened
she
moved
around
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
she
was
frightfully
tired
she
leaned
her
head
back
and
tried
to
think
of
something
to
calm
her
shaking
nerves
that
this
was
graham
home
that
he
sometimes
sat
in
that
very
chair
but
she
found
that
graham
meant
nothing
to
her
nothing
mattered
except
that
her
warning
had
been
in
time
so
intent
was
she
on
the
thing
that
she
was
listening
for
that
smaller
sounds
escaped
her
so
she
did
not
hear
a
door
open
and
the
soft
rustle
of
a
woman
negligee
as
it
swept
from
stair
to
stair
but
as
the
outside
the
door
she
stood
up
quickly
and
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
natalie
stood
framed
in
the
doorway
staring
at
her
well
she
said
and
on
receiving
no
answer
from
the
frightened
girl
what
are
you
doing
here
the
ugly
suspicion
in
her
voice
left
anna
speechless
for
a
moment
do
move
please
said
natalie
cold
voice
stay
just
where
you
she
reached
behind
the
curtain
at
the
doorway
and
anna
heard
the
ringing
of
a
bell
insistent
and
prolonged
the
girl
roused
herself
with
an
effort
i
came
to
see
that
is
a
likely
story
who
let
you
in
mr
mr
spencer
is
not
but
he
did
i
telling
you
the
truth
indeed
i
am
i
rang
the
bell
and
he
came
to
the
door
i
had
something
to
tell
what
could
you
possibly
have
to
tell
my
husband
at
this
but
anna
klein
did
not
answer
from
far
away
there
came
a
dull
report
followed
almost
immediately
by
a
second
one
the
windows
rattled
and
the
house
seemed
to
rock
rather
gently
on
its
foundation
then
silence
anna
klein
picked
up
her
empty
from
the
table
and
looked
at
it
i
was
too
late
she
said
dully
and
the
next
moment
she
was
lying
at
natalie
feet
chapter
xlii
it
was
not
until
dawn
that
the
full
extent
of
the
disaster
was
revealed
all
night
by
the
flames
from
the
sheds
in
the
yard
which
were
of
wood
and
still
burning
rescue
parties
had
worked
frantically
two
of
the
long
buildings
nearest
to
the
fuse
department
had
collapsed
entirely
above
the
piles
of
fallen
masonry
might
be
seen
here
and
there
the
black
mass
of
some
machine
or
lathe
and
it
was
there
the
search
parties
were
laboring
luckily
the
fuse
department
had
not
gone
double
turn
and
the
night
shift
in
the
was
not
a
full
one
the
fuse
department
was
a
roaring
furnace
and
repeated
calls
had
brought
in
most
of
the
fire
companies
of
the
city
running
back
and
forth
in
the
light
of
the
flames
were
the
firemen
and
such
volunteer
rescuers
as
had
been
allowed
through
the
police
cordon
outside
that
line
of
ropes
and
men
were
gathered
a
tragic
crowd
begging
imploring
to
be
allowed
through
to
search
for
some
beloved
body
now
and
then
a
fresh
explosion
made
the
mob
recoil
only
to
press
close
again
importuning
tragic
hopeless
the
casualty
list
ran
high
all
night
long
ambulances
stood
in
a
row
along
the
street
backed
up
to
the
curb
and
waiting
and
ever
so
often
a
silent
group
in
broken
step
carried
out
some
quiet
covered
thing
that
would
never
move
again
with
the
dawn
graham
found
his
father
he
had
thrown
off
his
coat
and
in
his
was
with
other
rescuers
digging
in
the
ruins
graham
himself
had
been
working
he
was
nauseated
weary
and
unutterably
wretched
for
he
had
seen
the
night
superintendent
and
had
heard
of
his
father
message
klein
he
said
you
do
mean
herman
klein
that
was
what
he
said
i
was
to
find
him
and
hold
him
until
he
got
here
but
i
could
find
him
he
may
have
got
out
there
no
way
of
telling
waves
of
fresh
nausea
swept
over
graham
he
sat
down
on
a
pile
of
bricks
and
wiped
his
forehead
clammy
with
sweat
i
hope
to
god
he
was
burned
alive
muttered
the
other
man
surveying
the
scene
his
eyes
were
reddened
with
smoke
from
the
fire
his
clothing
torn
i
was
knocked
down
myself
he
said
i
was
out
in
the
yard
looking
for
klein
and
i
guess
i
lay
there
quite
a
while
if
i
had
gone
out
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
how
many
women
were
on
the
night
shift
not
a
lot
twenty
perhaps
if
i
had
my
way
i
take
every
german
in
the
country
and
boil
in
oil
i
did
want
klein
back
but
he
was
a
good
workman
well
he
done
a
good
job
it
was
after
that
that
graham
saw
his
father
a
strange
clayton
who
drove
his
pick
with
a
sort
of
mad
strength
and
at
the
same
time
gave
orders
in
an
unfamiliar
voice
graham
himself
a
disordered
figure
watched
him
for
a
moment
he
was
divided
between
fear
and
resolution
some
place
in
that
debacle
there
lay
his
own
responsibility
he
was
still
bewildered
but
the
fact
that
anna
father
had
done
the
thing
was
ominous
the
urge
to
confession
was
stronger
than
his
fears
somehow
during
the
night
he
had
become
a
man
but
now
he
only
felt
that
somehow
during
the
night
he
had
become
a
murderer
clayton
looked
up
and
he
moved
toward
him
yes
i
had
some
coffee
made
at
a
house
down
the
street
wo
you
come
and
have
it
clayton
straightened
he
was
very
tired
and
the
yard
was
full
of
volunteers
now
each
provided
at
the
gate
with
a
pick
or
shovel
a
look
at
the
boy
face
decided
him
i
come
he
said
and
turned
his
pick
over
to
a
man
beside
him
he
joined
graham
and
for
a
moment
he
looked
into
the
boy
eyes
then
he
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
together
they
walked
out
past
the
line
of
ambulances
into
a
street
where
the
scattered
houses
showed
not
a
single
unshattered
window
and
the
pavements
were
littered
with
glass
his
father
touch
comforted
the
boy
but
it
made
even
harder
the
thing
he
had
to
do
for
he
could
not
go
through
life
with
this
thing
on
his
soul
there
had
been
a
moment
after
he
learned
of
herman
implication
when
he
felt
the
best
thing
would
be
to
kill
himself
but
he
had
put
that
aside
it
was
too
easy
if
herman
klein
had
done
this
thing
because
of
anna
and
himself
then
he
was
a
murderer
if
he
had
done
it
because
he
was
a
german
then
he
graham
had
no
right
to
die
he
would
live
to
make
as
many
germans
as
possible
pay
for
this
night
work
i
got
something
to
tell
you
father
he
said
as
they
paused
before
the
house
where
the
coffee
was
ready
clayton
nodded
and
together
they
went
inside
even
this
house
was
partially
destroyed
a
piece
of
masonry
had
gone
through
the
kitchen
and
standing
on
fallen
bricks
and
plaster
a
cheerful
old
woman
was
cooking
over
a
stove
which
had
somehow
escaped
destruction
it
bad
she
said
to
graham
as
she
poured
the
coffee
into
cups
but
it
might
have
been
worse
spencer
we
all
alive
and
i
guess
understand
what
my
boy
writing
home
about
now
they
sure
brought
the
war
here
this
graham
carried
the
coffee
into
the
little
parlor
where
clayton
sat
dropped
on
a
low
chair
his
hands
between
his
knees
he
was
a
strange
disheveled
figure
gray
of
face
and
weary
and
the
hand
he
held
out
for
the
cup
was
blistered
and
blackened
graham
did
not
touch
his
coffee
he
put
it
on
the
mantel
and
stood
waiting
while
clayton
finished
his
shall
i
tell
you
now
sir
clayton
drew
a
long
breath
it
was
herman
klein
who
did
it
probably
i
had
a
warning
last
night
but
it
was
too
late
i
should
have
known
of
course
but
somehow
i
did
he
been
with
us
a
long
time
i
have
sworn
he
was
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
graham
saw
his
father
weaken
the
pitiful
ashamed
weakness
of
a
strong
man
his
voice
broke
his
face
twitched
the
boy
drew
himself
up
they
could
both
go
to
pieces
he
could
not
know
that
clayton
had
worked
all
that
night
in
that
hell
with
the
conviction
that
in
some
way
his
own
son
was
responsible
that
he
knew
already
what
graham
was
about
to
tell
him
if
herman
klein
did
it
father
it
was
because
he
was
the
tool
of
a
gang
and
the
reason
he
was
a
tool
was
because
he
thought
i
was
living
with
anna
i
was
i
do
know
why
i
was
there
was
every
chance
i
suppose
i
meant
to
some
time
anyhow
he
thought
i
if
he
had
expected
any
outbreak
from
clayton
he
met
none
clayton
sat
looking
ahead
and
listening
inside
of
the
broken
windows
the
curtains
were
stirring
in
the
fresh
breeze
of
early
morning
and
in
the
kitchen
the
old
woman
was
piling
the
fallen
bricks
noisily
i
had
been
flirting
with
her
a
little
it
was
much
more
than
that
and
i
gave
her
a
watch
at
christmas
he
found
it
out
and
he
beat
her
awfully
she
ran
away
and
sent
for
me
and
i
met
her
she
had
to
hide
for
days
her
face
was
all
bruised
then
she
got
sick
from
it
she
was
sick
for
did
he
know
where
she
was
i
think
not
or
he
have
gone
to
get
her
but
rudolph
klein
knew
something
i
took
her
out
to
dinner
to
a
roadhouse
a
few
days
ago
and
she
said
she
saw
him
there
i
did
all
that
time
weeks
never
i
never
gone
to
her
room
that
night
i
did
i
do
know
why
i
go
well
i
went
but
i
did
stay
i
could
i
guess
she
thought
i
was
crazy
i
went
away
that
all
and
the
next
day
i
felt
that
she
might
be
feeling
as
though
i
turned
her
down
or
something
and
i
felt
responsible
maybe
you
wo
understand
i
do
quite
myself
anyhow
i
went
back
to
let
her
know
i
was
quite
a
brute
even
if
she
was
gone
i
not
trying
to
excuse
myself
it
a
rotten
story
for
i
was
engaged
to
marion
suddenly
he
sat
down
beside
clayton
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
for
some
reason
or
other
clayton
found
himself
back
in
the
hospital
that
night
when
joey
lay
still
and
quiet
and
graham
was
sobbing
like
a
child
prostrate
on
the
white
covering
of
the
bed
with
the
incredible
rapidity
of
thought
in
a
mental
crisis
he
saw
the
last
months
the
boy
desire
to
go
to
france
thwarted
his
attempt
to
interest
himself
in
the
business
the
tool
marion
hayden
had
made
of
him
anna
doglike
devotion
all
leading
inevitably
to
catastrophe
and
through
it
all
he
saw
natalie
holding
graham
back
from
war
providing
him
with
extra
money
excusing
him
using
his
confidences
for
her
own
ends
insidiously
sapping
the
boy
confidence
in
his
father
and
himself
we
have
to
stand
up
to
this
together
the
boy
looked
up
then
you
not
going
to
throw
me
over
altogether
but
all
this
if
herman
klein
had
not
done
it
there
were
others
who
would
probably
it
looks
as
though
you
had
provided
them
with
a
tool
but
i
suppose
we
were
vulnerable
in
a
dozen
he
rose
and
they
stood
eyes
level
father
and
son
in
the
early
morning
sunlight
and
suddenly
graham
arms
were
around
his
shoulders
and
something
tight
around
clayton
heart
relaxed
once
again
and
now
for
good
he
had
found
his
boy
the
little
boy
who
had
not
so
long
ago
stood
on
a
chair
for
this
very
embrace
only
now
the
boy
was
a
man
i
going
to
france
father
he
said
i
going
to
pay
them
back
for
this
and
out
of
every
two
shots
i
fire
one
will
be
for
perhaps
he
had
found
his
boy
only
to
lose
him
but
that
would
have
to
be
as
god
willed
at
ten
he
went
up
to
the
house
to
change
his
wet
and
draggled
clothing
the
ruins
were
being
guarded
by
soldiers
and
the
work
of
rescue
was
still
going
on
more
slowly
now
since
there
was
little
or
no
hope
of
finding
any
still
living
thing
in
that
wreckage
he
found
natalie
in
bed
with
madeleine
in
attendance
and
he
learned
that
her
physician
had
just
gone
he
felt
that
he
could
not
talk
to
her
just
then
she
had
a
morbid
interest
in
horrors
and
with
the
sights
of
that
night
fresh
in
his
mind
he
could
not
discuss
them
he
stopped
however
in
her
doorway
i
glad
you
are
resting
he
said
better

in
bed

a
resting

frightfully
i
sorry
my
dear
i

in
again
on
my
way
clay
he
turned
in
the
doorway
is
it
all
gone
everything
practically
but
you
were
insured
i
tell
you
about
that
later
i
have
given
it
much
thought
yet
i
do
know
just
how
we
i
shall
never
let
graham
go
back
to
it
again
i
warn
you
i
been
lying
here
for
hours
thinking
that
it
might
have
happened
as
easily
as
not
while
he
was
he
hardly
listened
he
had
just
remembered
anna
i
left
a
girl
here
last
night
natalie
he
said
do
you
happen
to
know
what
became
of
her
natalie
stirred
on
her
pillows
i
should
think
i
do
she
fainted
or
pretended
to
faint
the
servants
looked
after
has
she
gone
i
hope
so
it
is
almost
noon
oh
by
the
way
she
called
as
he
moved
off
there
is
a
message
for
you
a
woman
named
gould
from
the
central
hospital
she
wants
to
see
you
at
once
they
have
kept
the
telephone
ringing
all
the
clare
gould
that
was
odd
he
had
seen
her
taken
out
a
bruised
and
moaning
creature
her
masses
of
fair
hair
over
her
shoulders
her
eyes
shut
the
surgeons
had
said
she
was
not
badly
hurt
she
might
be
worse
than
they
thought
the
mention
of
her
name
brought
audrey
before
him
he
hoped
wherever
she
was
she
would
know
that
he
was
all
right
as
soon
as
he
had
changed
he
called
the
hospital
the
message
came
back
promptly
and
clearly
we
have
a
woman
named
gould
here
she
is
not
badly
hurt
but
she
is
hysterical
she
wants
to
see
you
but
if
you
ca
come
at
once
i
am
to
give
you
a
message
wait
a
moment
she
has
written
it
but
it
hardly
clayton
waited
it
about
somebody
you
know
who
had
gone
on
night
turn
recently
at
your
plant
i
ca
read
the
name
it
looks
like
it
is
valentine
is
it
perhaps
it
is
it
just
a
scrawl
but
the
first
name
is
clear
enough
afterward
he
did
not
remember
hanging
up
the
receiver
or
getting
out
of
the
house
he
seemed
to
come
to
himself
somewhat
at
the
hospital
and
at
the
door
to
clare
ward
his
brain
suddenly
cleared
he
did
not
need
clare
story
it
seemed
that
he
knew
it
all
had
known
it
long
ages
before
her
very
words
sounded
like
infinite
repetitions
of
something
he
had
heard
over
and
over
she
was
right
beside
me
and
i
was
showing
her
about
the
lathe
told
me
i
could
teach
her
she
was
picking
it
up
fast
too
and
she
liked
it
she
liked
it
the
fact
that
audrey
had
liked
it
broke
down
his
scanty
reserve
of
restraint
clayton
found
himself
looking
down
at
her
from
a
great
distance
she
was
very
remote
clare
pulled
herself
together
when
the
first
explosion
came
it
did
touch
us
but
i
guess
she
knew
it
meant
more
she
said
something
about
the
telephone
and
getting
help
and
there
be
more
and
she
started
to
run
i
just
stood
there
watching
her
run
and
waiting
and
then
the
second
one
came
and
suddenly
clare
seemed
to
disappear
altogether
he
felt
something
catch
his
arm
and
the
nurse
voice
very
calm
and
quiet
sit
down
i
get
you
then
he
was
swallowing
a
fluid
that
burned
his
throat
and
clare
was
crying
with
the
sheet
drawn
to
her
mouth
and
somewhere
audrey
he
got
up
and
the
nurse
followed
him
out
you
might
look
for
the
person
here
she
suggested
we
have
had
several
brought
he
was
still
dazed
but
he
followed
her
docilely
audrey
was
not
there
he
seemed
to
have
known
that
too
that
there
would
be
a
long
search
and
hours
of
agony
and
at
the
end
the
one
thing
he
did
not
know
was
what
was
to
be
at
the
end
all
that
afternoon
he
searched
going
from
hospital
to
hospital
and
at
each
one
as
he
stopped
that
curious
feeling
of
inner
knowledge
told
him
she
was
not
there
but
the
same
instinct
told
him
she
was
not
dead
he
would
have
known
it
if
she
was
dead
there
was
no
reasoning
in
it
he
could
not
reason
but
he
knew
somehow
then
late
in
the
afternoon
he
found
her
he
knew
that
he
had
found
her
it
was
as
though
at
the
entrance
of
the
hospital
some
sixth
sense
had
told
him
this
was
right
at
last
he
was
quite
steady
all
at
once
she
was
here
waiting
for
him
to
come
and
now
he
had
come
and
it
would
be
all
right
yet
for
a
time
it
seemed
all
wrong
she
was
not
conscious
had
not
roused
since
she
was
brought
it
there
were
white
screens
around
her
bed
and
behind
them
she
lay
alone
they
had
braided
her
hair
in
two
long
dark
braids
and
there
was
a
bandage
on
one
of
her
arms
she
looked
very
young
and
very
tired
but
quite
peaceful
his
arrival
had
caused
a
small
stir
of
excitement
his
own
prominence
the
disaster
with
which
the
country
was
ringing
but
for
a
few
minutes
before
the
doctors
arrived
he
was
alone
with
her
behind
the
screen
it
was
like
being
alone
with
his
dead
bent
over
her
his
face
pressed
to
one
of
her
quiet
hands
he
whispered
to
her
all
the
little
tendernesses
the
aching
want
of
her
that
so
long
he
had
buried
in
his
heart
things
he
could
not
have
told
her
waking
he
told
her
then
it
seemed
too
that
she
must
rouse
to
them
that
she
must
feel
him
there
beside
her
calling
her
back
but
she
did
not
move
it
was
then
for
the
first
time
that
he
wondered
what
he
would
do
if
she
should
die
the
doctors
coming
behind
the
screen
found
him
sitting
erect
and
still
staring
ahead
of
him
with
a
strange
expression
on
his
face
he
had
just
decided
that
he
could
not
under
any
circumstances
live
if
she
died
it
was
rather
a
good
thing
for
clayton
sanity
that
they
gave
him
hope
he
was
completely
unnerved
tired
and
desperate
indeed
when
they
came
in
he
had
been
picturing
audrey
and
himself
wandering
hand
in
hand
very
quietly
and
contentedly
in
some
strange
world
which
was
his
rather
hazy
idea
of
the
beyond
it
seemed
to
him
quite
sane
and
extraordinarily
happy
the
effort
of
meeting
the
staff
roused
him
and
with
hope
came
a
return
to
normality
there
was
much
to
be
done
special
nurses
a
private
room
and
rather
reluctantly
and
relatives
to
be
notified
only
for
a
few
minutes
out
of
all
of
life
had
she
been
his
he
must
give
her
up
now
life
had
become
one
long
renunciation
he
did
not
go
home
at
all
that
night
he
divided
his
time
between
the
plant
and
the
hospital
going
back
and
forward
each
time
he
found
the
report
good
she
was
still
strong
no
internal
injuries
had
manifested
themselves
and
the
concussion
would
probably
wear
off
before
long
he
wanted
to
be
there
when
she
first
opened
her
eyes
he
was
afraid
she
might
be
frightened
and
there
would
be
a
bad
minute
when
she
remembered
if
she
did
remember
at
midnight
going
into
the
room
he
found
haverford
beside
audrey
bed
knitting
placidly
she
seemed
to
accept
his
being
there
as
perfectly
natural
and
she
had
no
affectations
she
did
not
whisper
for
one
thing
the
nurse
thinks
she
is
coming
round
clayton
she
said
i
waited
because
i
thought
she
ought
to
see
a
familiar
face
when
she
haverford
was
eminently
good
for
him
her
cheerful
her
competent
sanity
restored
his
belief
in
a
world
that
had
seemed
only
chaos
and
death
how
much
he
wondered
later
had
haverford
suspected
he
had
not
been
in
any
condition
to
act
a
part
but
whatever
she
suspected
he
knew
was
locked
in
her
kindly
breast
audrey
moved
slightly
and
he
went
over
to
her
when
he
glanced
up
again
haverford
had
gone
out
so
it
was
that
audrey
came
back
to
him
and
to
him
alone
she
asked
no
questions
she
only
lay
quite
still
on
her
white
pillows
and
looked
at
him
even
when
he
knelt
beside
her
and
drew
her
toward
him
she
said
nothing
but
she
lifted
her
uninjured
hand
and
softly
caressed
his
bent
head
clayton
never
knew
whether
haverford
had
come
back
and
seen
that
or
not
he
did
not
care
for
that
matter
it
seemed
to
him
just
then
that
all
the
world
must
know
what
was
so
vitally
important
so
transcendently
wonderful
not
until
audrey
eyes
closed
again
and
he
saw
that
she
was
sleeping
did
he
loosen
his
arms
from
around
her
when
at
last
he
went
out
to
the
stiffly
furnished
hospital
parlor
he
found
haverford
sitting
there
alone
still
knitting
but
he
rather
thought
she
had
been
crying
there
was
an
undeniably
moist
handkerchief
on
her
knee
she
roused
a
little
while
ago
he
said
trying
to
speak
quietly
and
as
though
audrey
rousing
were
not
the
wonder
that
it
was
she
seemed
very
comfortable
and
now
she
the
dear
child
said
haverford
if
she
had
died
after
everything
her
plump
face
quivered
things
have
never
been
very
happy
for
her
i
afraid
he
went
to
a
window
and
stood
looking
out
the
city
was
not
quiet
but
its
mighty
roar
of
the
day
was
lowered
to
a
monotonous
drowsy
humming
from
the
east
reflected
against
clouds
was
the
dull
red
of
his
own
steel
mills
looking
like
the
reflection
of
a
vast
conflagration
not
very
happy
he
repeated
some
times
haverford
was
saying
i
wonder
about
things
people
go
along
missing
the
best
things
in
life
and
i
suppose
there
is
a
reason
for
it
but
some
times
i
wonder
if
he
ever
meant
us
to
go
on
crucifying
our
own
so
she
did
know
what
would
you
have
us
do
i
do
know
i
suppose
there
is
any
afterward
clayton
found
that
that
bit
of
conversation
with
haverford
took
on
the
unreality
of
the
rest
of
that
hours
but
one
part
of
it
stood
out
real
and
hopelessly
true
there
was
any
answer
chapter
xliii
anna
klein
had
gone
home
at
three
that
terrible
morning
a
trembling
girl
she
had
done
her
best
and
she
had
failed
unlike
graham
she
had
no
feeling
of
personal
responsibility
but
she
felt
she
could
never
again
face
her
father
with
the
thing
that
she
knew
between
them
there
were
other
reasons
too
herman
would
be
arrested
and
she
would
be
called
to
testify
she
had
known
she
had
warned
spencer
the
gang
rudolph
gang
would
get
her
for
that
she
knew
where
they
were
now
they
would
be
at
gus
in
the
back
room
drinking
to
the
success
of
their
scheme
and
gus
who
was
a
german
too
would
be
with
them
offering
a
round
of
drinks
on
the
house
now
and
then
as
his
share
of
the
night
rejoicing
gus
who
was
already
arranging
to
help
by
sending
them
over
the
mexican
border
she
would
have
to
go
back
to
get
in
and
out
again
if
she
could
before
herman
came
back
she
had
no
clothes
except
what
she
stood
up
in
and
those
in
her
haste
that
night
were
only
her
print
with
a
long
coat
she
would
have
to
find
a
new
position
and
she
would
have
to
have
her
clothing
to
get
about
in
she
dragged
along
singularly
unmolested
once
or
twice
a
man
eyed
her
but
her
white
face
and
vacant
eyes
were
unattractive
almost
sodden
she
was
barely
able
to
climb
the
hill
and
as
she
neared
the
house
her
trepidation
increased
what
if
herman
had
come
back
if
he
suspected
her
he
would
kill
her
he
must
have
been
half
mad
to
have
done
the
thing
anyhow
he
would
surely
be
half
mad
now
and
because
she
was
young
and
strong
and
life
was
still
a
mystery
to
be
solved
she
did
not
want
to
die
strangely
enough
face
to
face
with
danger
there
was
still
in
the
back
of
her
head
an
exultant
thrill
in
her
very
determination
to
live
she
would
start
over
again
and
she
would
work
hard
and
make
good
you
bet
i
make
good
she
resolved
just
give
me
a
chance
and
work
my
fool
head
which
was
by
way
of
being
a
prayer
it
was
the
darkest
hour
before
the
dawn
when
she
reached
the
cottage
it
was
black
and
very
still
and
outside
the
gate
she
stooped
and
slipped
off
her
shoes
the
window
into
the
shed
by
which
she
had
escaped
was
still
open
and
she
crouched
outside
listening
when
the
stillness
remained
unbroken
she
climbed
in
tense
for
a
movement
or
a
blow
once
inside
however
she
drew
a
long
breath
the
doors
were
still
locked
and
the
keys
gone
so
herman
had
not
returned
but
as
she
stood
there
hurried
stealthy
footsteps
came
along
the
street
and
turned
in
at
the
gate
in
a
panic
she
flew
up
the
stairs
and
into
her
room
where
the
door
still
hung
crazily
on
its
hinges
she
stood
there
listening
her
heart
pounding
in
her
ears
and
below
she
distinctly
heard
a
key
in
the
kitchen
door
she
did
the
only
thing
she
could
think
of
she
lifted
the
door
into
place
and
stood
against
it
bracing
it
with
her
body
whoever
it
was
was
in
the
kitchen
now
moving
however
more
swiftly
than
herman
she
heard
matches
striking
then
hsst
she
knew
that
it
was
rudolph
and
she
braced
herself
mentally
rudolph
was
keener
than
herman
if
he
found
her
door
in
that
condition
and
she
herself
dressed
working
silently
and
still
holding
the
door
in
place
she
flung
off
her
coat
she
even
unpinned
her
hair
and
unfastened
her
dress
when
his
signal
remained
unanswered
a
second
time
he
called
her
by
name
and
she
heard
him
coming
up
anna
he
repeated
yes
he
was
startled
to
hear
her
voice
so
close
to
the
door
in
the
dark
she
heard
him
fumbling
for
the
knob
he
happened
on
the
padlock
instead
and
he
laughed
a
little
by
that
she
knew
that
he
was
not
quite
sober
locked
you
in
has
he
what
do
you
want
has
herman
come
home
yet
he
does
get
home
until
has
he
been
back
at
all
she
hesitated
how
do
i
know
i
been
asleep
some
sleep
he
said
and
suddenly
lurched
against
the
door
in
spite
of
her
it
yielded
and
although
she
braced
herself
with
all
her
strength
his
weight
against
it
caused
it
to
give
way
it
was
a
suspicious
crafty
rudolph
who
picked
himself
up
and
made
a
clutch
at
her
in
the
dark
you
little
liar
he
said
thickly
and
struck
a
match
she
cowered
away
from
him
i
was
going
to
run
away
rudolph
she
cried
he
has
any
business
locking
me
in
i
wo
stand
for
you
been
no
out
after
him
honest
to
god
rudolph
no
i
hate
him
i
do
ever
want
to
see
him
he
put
a
hand
out
into
the
darkness
and
finding
her
tried
to
draw
her
to
him
she
struggled
and
he
released
her
all
at
once
she
knew
that
he
was
weak
with
fright
the
bravado
had
died
out
of
him
the
face
she
had
touched
was
covered
with
a
clammy
sweat
i
wish
to
god
herman
would
what
d
you
want
with
him
have
you
got
any
whisky
you
had
enough
of
that
some
one
was
walking
along
the
street
outside
she
felt
that
he
was
listening
crouched
ready
to
run
but
the
steps
went
on
look
here
anna
he
said
when
he
had
pulled
himself
together
again
i
going
to
get
out
of
this
i
going
all
right
you
can
go
for
all
of
mean
to
say
you
been
asleep
all
night
you
did
hear
anything
hear
what
he
laughed
you
know
soon
then
he
told
her
hurriedly
that
he
was
going
away
he
come
back
to
get
her
to
promise
to
follow
him
he
was
going
to
stay
here
and
and
what
and
be
drafted
he
finished
rather
lamely
gus
has
a
friend
in
a
town
on
the
mexican
border
he
said
he
got
maps
of
the
country
to
mexico
city
and
the
germans
there
fix
you
up
all
right
i
get
rich
down
there
and
some
day
i
send
for
you
that
he
darted
to
the
window
faintly
outlined
by
a
distant
three
men
were
standing
quietly
outside
the
gate
and
a
fourth
was
already
in
the
garden
silently
moving
toward
the
house
she
felt
rudolph
brush
by
her
and
the
trembling
hand
he
laid
on
her
arm
now
lie
he
whispered
fiercely
you
have
seen
me
i
have
been
here
then
he
was
gone
she
ran
to
the
window
the
other
three
men
were
coming
in
moving
watchfully
and
slowly
and
rudolph
was
at
katie
window
cursing
if
she
was
a
prisoner
so
was
rudolph
he
realized
that
instantly
and
she
heard
him
breaking
out
the
sash
with
a
chair
at
the
sound
the
three
figures
broke
into
a
run
and
she
heard
the
sash
give
way
almost
instantly
there
was
firing
the
first
shot
was
close
and
she
knew
it
was
rudolph
firing
from
the
window
some
wild
design
of
braining
him
from
behind
with
a
chair
flashed
into
her
desperate
mind
but
when
she
had
felt
her
way
into
katie
room
he
had
gone
the
garden
below
was
quiet
but
there
was
yelling
and
the
crackling
of
underbrush
from
the
then
a
scattering
of
shots
again
and
silence
the
yard
was
empty
the
hill
paid
but
moderate
attention
to
shots
they
were
usually
merely
pyrotechnic
and
indicated
rejoicing
rather
than
death
but
here
and
there
she
heard
a
window
raised
and
then
lowered
again
the
hill
had
gone
back
to
bed
anna
went
into
her
room
and
dressed
for
the
first
time
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
be
held
by
the
police
and
the
thought
was
unbearable
it
was
when
she
was
making
her
escape
that
she
found
a
prostrate
figure
in
the
yard
and
knew
that
one
of
shots
had
gone
home
she
could
not
go
away
and
leave
that
not
unless
a
terrible
hatred
of
herman
and
rudolph
and
all
their
kind
suddenly
swept
over
her
she
would
not
run
away
she
would
stay
and
tell
all
the
terrible
truth
it
was
her
big
moment
and
she
rose
to
it
she
would
see
it
through
what
was
her
own
safety
to
letting
this
band
of
murderers
escape
and
all
that
in
the
few
seconds
it
took
to
reach
the
fallen
figure
it
was
only
when
she
was
very
close
that
she
saw
it
was
moving
tell
dunbar
he
went
to
the
left
a
voice
was
saying
the
left
they
lose
him
joey
hello
said
joey
voice
he
considered
that
he
was
speaking
very
loud
but
it
was
hardly
more
than
a
whisper
that
was
your
father
was
it
the
old
boy
could
jump
and
run
like
are
you
hurt
he
coughed
a
little
a
gurgling
cough
that
rather
startled
himself
but
he
was
determined
to
be
a
man
no
i
just
lay
down
here
for
a
nap
who
was
it
that
jumped
my
cousin
rudolph
do
you
think
i
can
help
you
into
the
house
i
walk
there
myself
in
a
minute
unless
your
cousin
rudolph
his
head
dropped
back
on
her
arm
i
feel
sort
of
all
his
voice
trailed
off
joey
lem
me
alone
he
muttered
i
the
first
casualty
in
the
american
army
i
he
made
a
desperate
effort
to
speak
in
a
man
voice
but
the
higher
boyish
notes
of
sixteen
conquered
they
certainly
gave
us
hell
but
we
going
to
build
again
me
and
clayton
spen
all
at
once
he
was
very
still
anna
spoke
to
him
and
that
failing
gave
him
a
frantic
little
shake
but
joey
had
gone
to
another
partnership
beyond
the
stars
chapter
xliv
the
immediate
outstanding
result
of
the
holocaust
at
the
munitions
works
was
the
end
of
natalie
dominion
aver
graham
she
never
quite
forgave
him
the
violence
with
which
he
threw
off
her
shackles
if
i
been
half
a
man
i
have
been
over
there
long
ago
he
said
standing
before
her
tall
and
young
and
flushed
i
have
learned
my
job
by
now
and
i
be
worth
something
now
i
and
broken
my
hearts
do
break
that
way
well
you
say
you
are
going
now
i
should
think
you
be
satisfied
there
plenty
of
time
for
you
to
get
the
glory
you
glory
i
do
want
any
glory
and
as
for
plenty
of
time
exactly
what
there
during
the
next
few
days
she
preserved
an
obstinate
silence
on
the
subject
she
knew
he
had
been
admitted
to
one
of
the
and
that
he
was
making
rather
helpless
and
puzzled
purchases
going
into
his
room
she
would
find
a
of
khaki
leather
perhaps
or
flannel
shirts
of
the
same
indeterminate
hue
she
would
shed
futile
tears
over
them
and
order
them
put
out
of
sight
but
she
never
offered
to
assist
him
graham
was
older
in
many
ways
he
no
longer
ran
up
and
down
the
stairs
whistling
and
he
sought
every
opportunity
to
be
with
his
father
they
spent
long
hours
together
in
the
library
when
after
a
crowded
day
filled
with
the
thousand
problems
of
reconstructions
clayton
smoked
a
great
deal
talked
a
little
rather
after
the
manner
of
men
of
personal
responsibility
in
the
war
and
quietly
watched
the
man
who
was
graham
out
of
those
quiet
hours
with
natalie
at
the
theater
or
reading
in
bed
clayton
got
the
greatest
comfort
of
his
life
he
would
neither
look
back
nor
peer
anxiously
ahead
the
past
with
its
tragedy
was
gone
the
future
might
hold
even
worse
things
but
just
now
he
would
live
each
day
as
it
came
working
to
the
utmost
and
giving
his
evenings
to
his
boy
the
nights
were
the
worst
he
was
not
sleeping
well
and
in
those
long
hours
of
quiet
he
tried
to
rebuild
his
life
along
stronger
sterner
lines
love
could
have
no
place
in
it
but
there
was
work
left
he
was
strong
and
he
was
still
young
the
country
should
have
every
ounce
of
energy
in
him
he
would
the
plant
on
bigger
lines
than
before
and
when
that
was
done
he
would
build
again
the
best
he
could
do
was
not
enough
he
scarcely
noticed
natalie
withdrawal
from
graham
and
himself
when
she
was
around
he
was
his
old
punctilious
self
gravely
kind
more
than
ever
considerate
beside
his
failure
to
her
her
own
failure
to
him
faded
into
insignificance
she
was
as
she
was
and
through
no
fault
of
hers
but
he
was
what
he
had
made
himself
once
or
twice
he
had
felt
an
overwhelming
remorse
toward
her
and
on
one
such
occasion
he
had
made
a
useless
effort
to
break
down
the
barrier
of
her
long
silence
do
go
natalie
he
had
begged
i
am
not
very
amusing
i
know
but
i
try
my
best
i
promise
not
to
touch
on
anything
he
had
been
standing
in
the
hail
looking
up
at
her
on
the
and
he
smiled
there
was
pleading
behind
the
smile
an
inarticulate
feeling
that
between
them
there
might
at
least
be
friendship
you
are
never
disagreeable
she
had
said
looking
down
with
hostile
eyes
you
are
quite
then
wo
you
wait
perfection
bores
me
to
tears
she
said
and
went
on
up
the
stairs
on
the
morning
of
graham
departure
however
he
found
her
prepared
to
go
to
the
she
was
and
pale
and
he
was
very
sorry
for
her
do
you
think
it
is
wise
he
asked
i
shall
see
him
off
of
course
i
may
never
see
him
and
his
own
tautened
nerves
almost
gave
way
do
say
that
he
cried
do
even
think
that
and
for
god
sake
natalie
send
him
off
with
a
smile
that
the
least
we
can
i
ca
take
it
as
casually
as
you
he
gave
up
then
in
despair
he
saw
that
graham
watched
her
uneasily
during
the
early
breakfast
and
he
surmised
that
the
boy
own
grip
on
his
was
weakened
by
the
tears
that
dropped
into
her
he
reflected
bitterly
that
all
over
the
country
strong
women
good
women
were
sending
their
boys
away
to
war
giving
them
with
prayer
and
exaltation
what
was
wrong
with
natalie
what
was
wrong
with
his
whole
life
when
graham
was
he
turned
to
her
why
do
you
persist
in
going
natalie
i
intend
to
go
that
do
you
think
you
made
him
unhappy
enough
he
has
made
me
unhappy
you
it
is
always
yourself
natalie
why
do
you
ever
think
of
him
he
went
to
the
door
countermand
the
order
for
the
limousine
he
said
to
the
butler
and
order
the
small
car
for
graham
and
how
dare
you
do
that
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
ruin
the
biggest
day
in
his
she
saw
that
he
meant
it
she
was
incredulous
reckless
angry
and
thwarted
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
i
hate
you
she
said
slowly
i
hate
you
she
turned
and
went
slowly
up
the
stairs
graham
knocking
at
her
door
a
few
minutes
later
heard
the
sound
of
hysterical
sobbing
within
but
received
no
reply
mother
he
called
do
worry
i
be
all
when
he
saw
she
did
not
mean
to
open
the
door
or
to
reply
he
went
rather
heavily
down
the
stairs
i
wish
she
would
he
said
it
makes
me
darned
but
clayton
surmised
a
relief
behind
his
regret
and
in
the
train
the
boy
eyes
were
happier
than
they
had
been
for
months
i
do
know
how
i
come
out
dad
he
said
but
if
i
do
get
through
it
wo
be
because
i
did
and
he
did
try
the
enormous
interest
of
the
thing
gripped
him
from
the
start
there
was
romance
in
it
too
he
wore
his
first
uniform
too
small
for
him
as
it
was
with
immense
pride
he
rolled
out
in
the
morning
at
reveille
with
the
feeling
that
he
had
just
gone
to
bed
ate
hugely
at
breakfast
learned
to
make
his
own
and
lined
up
on
a
vast
dusty
parade
ground
for
endless
evolutions
in
a
boiling
sun
it
was
rather
amusing
to
find
himself
being
ordered
about
in
a
stentorian
voice
by
jackson
and
when
in
off
moments
that
capable
condescended
to
a
few
moments
of
talk
and
relaxation
the
boy
was
highly
gratified
do
you
think
i
got
anything
in
me
he
would
inquire
anxiously
and
jackson
always
said
heartily
sure
you
there
were
times
when
graham
doubted
himself
however
there
was
one
dreadful
hour
when
graham
in
the
late
afternoon
and
under
the
eyes
of
his
commanding
officer
and
a
group
of
ladies
conducting
the
highly
formal
and
complicated
ceremony
of
changing
the
guard
tied
a
lot
of
grinning
men
up
in
a
knot
which
required
the
captain
of
the
company
and
two
sergeants
to
untangle
i
no
earthly
good
he
confided
to
jackson
that
night
sitting
on
the
steps
of
his
barracks
i
know
it
like
and
then
i
get
up
and
try
it
and
all
at
once
i
just
a
plain
damned
do
give
up
like
that
son
jackson
said
i
seen
march
a
platoon
right
into
the
porch
before
now
and
once
i
just
saved
a
and
a
pair
of
clayton
wrote
him
daily
and
now
and
then
there
came
a
letter
from
natalie
cheerful
on
the
surface
but
its
cheerfulness
obviously
forced
and
once
to
his
great
surprise
marion
hayden
wrote
him
i
just
want
you
to
know
she
said
that
i
am
still
interested
in
you
even
if
it
is
going
to
be
anything
else
and
that
i
am
ridiculously
proud
of
you
is
it
queer
to
look
back
on
last
winter
and
think
what
a
lot
of
careless
idiots
we
were
i
suppose
war
does
really
change
us
but
it
does
make
us
wonder
what
we
got
in
us
i
am
surprised
to
find
that
i
am
a
great
deal
better
than
i
ever
thought
i
was
there
was
comfort
in
the
letter
but
no
thrill
he
was
far
away
from
all
that
now
like
one
on
the
first
stage
of
a
long
journey
with
his
eyes
ahead
then
one
day
he
saw
a
familiar
but
yet
strange
figure
striding
along
the
country
road
graham
was
that
day
and
the
strange
but
familiar
figure
was
almost
on
him
when
he
looked
up
it
was
extremely
military
and
looked
like
a
general
at
least
also
it
was
very
red
in
the
face
and
was
clutching
doggedly
in
its
teeth
an
old
briar
pipe
but
what
had
appeared
from
the
front
to
be
an
ultra
military
figure
on
closer
inspection
turned
out
to
be
a
procession
pulling
back
hard
on
a
rope
behind
was
the
company
goat
elinor
the
figure
paused
by
graham
and
said
young
man
do
you
know
where
this
creature
belongs
i
found
her
trying
to
commit
suicide
on
the
rifle
range
why
graham
it
was
doctor
haverford
he
grew
a
trifle
less
military
then
and
borrowed
some
pipe
tobacco
he
looked
oddly
younger
graham
thought
and
rather
of
his
uniform
every
inch
a
soldier
graham
he
chuckled
still
have
to
use
a
hook
and
eye
at
the
bottom
of
the
coat
blouse
he
corrected
himself
but
i
getting
my
again
how
the
whoa
he
called
as
elinor
wrapped
the
rope
around
his
carefully
putted
legs
infernal
animal
he
grumbled
i
just
paid
a
quarter
to
have
these
puttees
shined
how
the
family
mother
has
gone
to
linndale
the
house
is
finished
have
you
been
here
long
sir
two
weeks
hang
it
all
graham
i
wish
i
let
this
creature
commit
suicide
she
do
you
know
delight
is
here
here
why
at
the
hostess
house
said
the
chaplain
proudly
doing
her
bit
too
haverford
wanted
to
come
too
and
sew
buttons
on
or
something
but
i
told
her
two
out
of
three
was
a
fair
percentage
i
hear
that
washington
has
sent
for
your
father
i
had
he
a
big
man
graham
we
going
to
hear
from
him
only
i
thought
he
looked
tired
when
i
saw
him
last
somebody
ought
to
look
after
him
a
he
was
patiently
untangling
himself
from
elinor
rope
you
know
there
are
two
kinds
of
people
in
the
world
those
who
look
after
themselves
and
those
who
look
after
others
that
your
father
the
graham
face
clouded
how
true
that
was
he
knew
now
as
he
had
not
known
before
he
was
thinking
clearly
those
days
hard
work
and
nothing
to
drink
had
clarified
his
mind
and
he
saw
things
at
home
as
they
really
were
clayton
infinite
patience
his
strength
and
his
gentleness
but
he
only
said
he
has
had
a
hard
he
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
at
the
chaplain
i
did
help
him
any
you
know
well
well
that
all
over
now
we
just
one
thing
to
think
of
and
that
to
beat
those
german
devils
back
to
berlin
and
then
burn
berlin
he
added
militantly
the
last
graham
saw
of
him
he
was
dragging
elinor
down
the
road
and
a
faint
throaty
humming
came
back
which
sounded
suspiciously
like
where
do
we
go
from
here
boys
where
do
we
go
from
here
candidate
spencer
took
great
pains
with
his
toilet
that
afternoon
he
polished
his
shoes
and
shaved
and
he
spent
a
half
hour
on
some
ten
sadly
neglected
at
retreat
he
stood
at
attention
in
the
long
line
and
watched
the
flag
moving
slowly
and
majestically
to
the
stirring
bugle
notes
something
swelled
almost
to
bursting
in
his
throat
that
was
his
flag
he
was
going
to
fight
for
it
and
after
that
was
done
he
was
going
to
find
some
girl
some
nice
girl
the
sort
for
instance
that
would
leave
her
home
to
work
in
a
hostess
house
and
having
found
her
he
would
marry
her
and
love
and
cherish
her
all
his
life
unless
of
course
she
would
have
him
he
was
inclined
to
think
she
would
he
ate
very
little
supper
that
night
little
being
a
comparative
term
of
course
and
then
he
went
to
discover
delight
it
appeared
however
that
she
had
been
already
discovered
she
was
entirely
surrounded
by
uniforms
and
graham
furiously
counted
a
colonel
two
majors
and
a
captain
pulling
rank
of
course
he
muttered
and
retired
to
a
corner
where
he
had
at
least
the
mild
gratification
of
seeing
that
even
the
colonel
could
not
keep
delight
from
her
work
silly
asses
said
graham
again
and
then
she
saw
him
there
was
no
question
about
her
being
pleased
she
was
quite
flushed
with
it
but
a
little
uncomfortable
too
at
graham
attitude
he
was
oddly
humble
and
yet
he
had
a
look
of
determination
that
was
almost
grim
she
filled
in
a
rather
disquieting
silence
by
trying
to
let
him
know
without
revealing
that
she
had
ever
been
anything
else
how
proud
she
was
of
him
then
she
realized
that
he
was
not
listening
and
that
he
was
looking
at
her
with
an
almost
painful
intensity
when
can
you
get
away
delight
he
asked
abruptly
from
here
she
cast
an
appraising
glance
over
the
room
right
away
i
think
why
because
i
want
to
talk
to
you
and
i
ca
talk
to
you
she
brought
a
bright
colored
sweater
and
he
helped
her
into
it
still
with
his
mouth
set
and
his
eyes
a
trifle
sunken
all
about
there
were
laughing
groups
of
men
in
uniform
outside
the
parade
glowed
faintly
in
the
dusk
and
from
the
low
barrack
windows
there
came
the
glow
of
lights
the
movement
of
young
figures
voices
the
thin
metallic
notes
of
a
mandolin
how
strange
it
all
is
delight
said
here
we
are
you
and
father
and
myself
and
even
jackson
i
saw
him
all
here
living
different
lives
doing
different
things
even
thinking
different
thoughts
it
as
though
we
had
all
moved
into
a
different
he
walked
on
beside
her
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
which
were
yet
only
of
her
i
did
know
you
were
here
he
brought
out
finally
that
because
you
been
burying
yourself
i
knew
you
were
why
did
you
send
me
some
word
she
stiffened
somewhat
in
the
darkness
i
did
think
you
would
be
greatly
interested
and
again
struggling
with
his
new
humility
he
was
silent
it
was
not
until
they
had
crossed
the
parade
ground
and
were
beyond
the
noises
of
the
barracks
that
he
spoke
again
do
you
mind
if
i
talk
to
you
delight
i
mean
about
myself
i
since
you
here
we
likely
to
see
each
other
now
and
then
if
you
are
willing
and
i
like
to
start
do
you
really
want
to
tell
me
no
but
i
got
to
that
he
told
her
he
made
no
case
for
himself
indeed
some
of
it
delight
understood
far
better
than
he
did
himself
he
said
nothing
against
marion
on
the
contrary
he
blamed
himself
rather
severely
and
behind
his
honest
halting
sentences
delight
read
his
own
lack
of
understanding
she
felt
infinitely
older
than
this
tall
boy
in
his
stained
uniform
older
and
more
sophisticated
but
if
she
had
understood
the
marion
hayden
situation
she
was
totally
at
a
loss
as
to
anna
but
i
do
understand
she
cried
how
could
you
make
love
to
her
if
you
did
love
her
i
do
know
fellows
do
those
things
it
just
mischief
some
sort
of
a
devil
in
them
i
when
he
reached
the
beating
and
anna
flight
however
she
understood
a
little
better
of
course
you
had
to
stand
by
her
she
agreed
you
have
heard
it
all
he
said
quietly
when
i
through
if
you
get
up
and
leave
me
i
understand
delight
and
i
wo
blame
he
told
her
the
rest
of
the
story
in
a
voice
strained
with
anxiety
it
was
as
though
he
had
come
to
a
tribunal
for
judgment
he
spared
her
nothing
the
dinner
at
the
with
rudolph
at
the
window
his
visit
to
anna
room
and
her
subsequent
disappearance
she
told
the
department
of
justice
people
that
rudolph
found
her
that
night
and
took
her
home
she
was
a
prisoner
then
poor
little
kid
but
she
overheard
her
father
and
rudolph
plotting
to
blow
up
the
mill
that
where
i
came
in
delight
he
was
crazy
at
me
he
was
a
german
of
course
and
he
might
have
done
it
anyhow
but
rudolph
told
him
a
lot
of
lies
about
me
and
he
did
it
when
i
think
about
it
all
and
about
joey
i
she
slipped
her
hand
over
his
of
course
they
would
have
done
it
anyhow
she
said
softly
you
are
going
to
get
up
and
go
away
why
should
i
she
asked
i
only
feel
oh
graham
how
wretched
you
must
have
something
in
her
voice
made
him
sit
up
straighter
he
knew
now
that
it
had
always
been
delight
always
only
she
had
been
too
good
for
him
she
had
set
a
standard
he
had
not
hoped
to
reach
but
now
things
were
different
he
had
amounted
to
much
in
other
things
but
he
was
a
soldier
now
he
meant
to
be
a
mighty
good
soldier
and
when
he
got
his
commission
you
wo
mind
then
if
i
come
in
to
see
you
now
and
then
mind
why
graham
and
you
do
think
i
quite
hopeless
do
you
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
but
she
answered
bravely
i
believe
in
you
every
minute
but
then
i
think
i
always
like
fun
you
have
but
although
he
laughed
it
was
a
shaky
laugh
suddenly
he
stood
up
and
shook
himself
he
felt
young
and
strong
and
extremely
happy
there
had
been
a
bad
time
but
it
was
behind
him
now
ahead
there
lay
high
adventure
and
here
beside
him
in
the
dusk
was
the
girl
of
his
heart
she
believed
in
him
work
to
do
and
a
woman
who
believed
in
a
fellow
that
was
life
are
you
cold
he
asked
and
drew
the
gaudy
sweater
tenderly
around
her
shoulders
chapter
xlv
the
fact
that
audrey
valentine
conspicuous
member
of
a
conspicuous
social
group
that
she
was
had
been
working
in
the
of
the
spencer
munitions
works
at
the
time
of
the
explosion
was
in
itself
sufficient
to
rouse
the
greatest
interest
when
a
young
reporter
gathering
stories
about
the
event
from
the
pitiful
wreckage
in
the
hospitals
happened
on
clare
gould
he
got
a
for
the
sunday
edition
that
made
audrey
own
world
reading
it
in
bed
or
over
its
exquisite
gasp
with
amazement
for
following
up
clare
story
he
found
that
audrey
had
done
much
more
than
run
toward
the
telephone
she
had
reached
it
had
found
the
operator
gone
and
had
succeeded
before
the
roof
fell
in
on
her
in
calling
the
fire
department
and
in
sending
in
a
general
alarm
to
all
the
hospitals
the
reporter
found
the
night
operator
who
had
received
the
message
he
got
a
photograph
of
her
too
and
from
the
society
file
an
old
one
of
audrey
very
delicate
and
audacious
and
not
greatly
resembling
the
young
woman
who
lay
in
her
bed
and
read
the
article
aloud
between
dismay
and
laughter
to
old
terry
mackenzie
good
heavens
terry
she
said
listen
i
had
heard
the
explosion
but
did
not
of
course
know
what
it
was
and
then
i
got
a
signal
and
it
was
the
spencer
plant
a
sweet
southern
voice
said
very
calmly
this
is
important
listen
carefully
there
has
been
an
explosion
at
the
spencer
plant
and
the
ruins
are
on
fire
there
will
probably
be
more
explosions
in
a
minute
send
in
a
general
and
then
get
all
the
ambulances
and
doctors
then
there
was
another
explosion
and
their
lines
went
out
of
commission
i
am
glad
she
is
not
dead
she
certainly
had
her
fame
at
last
audrey
said
old
terry
very
gently
it
shameless
but
she
was
a
little
pleased
nevertheless
not
at
the
publicity
that
was
familiar
enough
but
that
when
her
big
moment
came
she
had
met
it
squarely
terry
was
striding
about
the
room
his
visits
were
always
rather
cyclonic
he
moved
from
chair
to
chair
leaving
about
each
one
an
encircling
ring
of
cigaret
ashes
and
carefully
inspecting
each
new
vase
of
flowers
he
stopped
in
front
of
a
basket
of
exquisite
small
orchids
who
sent
this
he
demanded
rodney
page
does
it
look
like
him
he
turned
and
stared
at
her
what
come
over
clayton
spencer
is
he
blind
blind
about
rodney
he
head
over
heels
in
love
with
natalie
spencer
god
alone
knows
i
daresay
it
is
serious
he
is
always
in
love
with
there
a
good
bit
of
talk
i
do
give
a
hang
for
either
of
them
but
i
fond
of
clayton
so
are
you
natalie
out
in
the
country
now
and
rodney
is
there
every
it
a
scandal
that
all
as
for
natalie
herself
she
ought
to
be
interned
as
a
dangerous
pacifist
a
martyr
in
her
own
eyes
thank
heaven
there
are
many
like
audrey
leaned
back
against
her
pillows
i
wonder
terry
she
said
if
you
have
shown
me
what
to
do
next
i
might
be
able
to
reach
some
of
the
women
like
natalie
there
are
some
of
them
and
they
got
to
learn
that
if
they
do
stand
behind
the
men
we
fine
he
agreed
get
to
knit
less
and
write
more
letters
cheerful
letters
tell
to
remember
that
by
the
time
their
man
gets
the
letter
the
baby
tooth
will
be
through
there
are
a
good
many
men
in
the
vicariously
cutting
teeth
get
after
audrey
a
worried
man
is
a
poor
after
he
had
gone
she
had
the
nurse
bring
her
paper
and
pencil
and
she
wrote
rather
incoherently
it
is
true
her
first
appeal
to
the
women
of
the
country
it
was
effective
too
audrey
was
an
effective
person
when
clayton
came
for
his
daily
visit
she
had
just
finished
it
and
was
reading
it
over
with
considerable
complacency
i
become
an
author
clay
she
said
i
think
myself
i
terribly
good
at
it
may
i
read
it
to
you
he
listened
gravely
but
with
a
little
flicker
of
amusement
in
his
eyes
how
like
her
it
was
to
refuse
to
allow
herself
even
time
to
get
entirely
well
but
when
she
finished
he
was
thoughtful
she
had
called
it
slacker
that
was
what
natalie
was
he
had
never
put
it
into
words
before
natalie
was
a
slacker
he
had
never
discussed
natalie
attitude
toward
the
war
with
audrey
he
rather
thought
she
was
entirely
ignorant
of
it
but
her
little
article
glowing
with
patriotism
frank
simple
and
convincing
might
have
been
written
to
natalie
herself
it
is
very
fine
he
said
i
rather
think
you
have
found
yourself
at
last
there
are
a
lot
of
such
women
and
i
daresay
they
will
be
fewer
all
the
time
but
they
exist
of
she
glowed
under
his
approval
there
was
in
all
their
meetings
a
of
sadness
that
they
must
be
so
brief
that
before
long
they
must
end
altogether
that
they
could
not
put
into
words
the
things
that
were
in
their
eyes
and
their
hearts
after
that
first
hour
of
her
return
to
consciousness
there
had
been
no
expressed
tenderness
between
them
the
nurse
sat
in
the
room
eternally
knitting
and
clayton
sat
near
audrey
or
read
to
her
or
like
terry
wandered
about
the
room
but
now
and
then
audrey
enthroned
like
a
princess
on
her
pillows
would
find
his
eyes
on
her
and
such
a
hungry
look
in
them
that
she
would
clench
her
hands
and
after
such
times
she
always
said
now
tell
me
about
the
or
about
washington
where
he
was
being
summoned
with
increasing
frequency
or
about
graham
anything
to
take
that
look
out
of
his
eyes
he
told
her
all
his
plans
he
even
brought
the
of
the
new
plant
and
spread
them
out
on
the
bed
he
was
dreaming
a
great
dream
those
days
and
audrey
knew
it
he
was
building
again
this
time
not
for
himself
but
for
the
nation
after
he
had
gone
looking
boyish
and
reluctant
she
would
lie
for
a
little
while
watching
the
door
perhaps
he
had
forgotten
something
and
would
come
back
one
day
he
did
and
was
surprised
to
find
her
suddenly
in
tears
you
came
back
she
said
half
hysterically
you
came
that
was
the
only
time
in
all
those
weeks
that
he
kissed
her
the
nurse
had
gone
out
and
suddenly
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
held
her
to
him
he
put
her
back
very
gently
and
she
saw
that
he
was
pale
i
think
i
better
go
now
and
not
come
back
he
said
and
for
two
long
and
endless
days
he
did
not
come
then
on
the
third
he
came
very
stiff
and
formal
and
with
himself
well
in
hand
audrey
leaning
back
and
watching
him
felt
what
a
boy
he
was
after
all
so
determined
to
do
the
right
thing
so
obvious
with
his
and
so
in
june
she
left
the
hospital
and
went
to
the
country
she
had
already
made
a
little
market
for
her
work
and
she
wanted
to
carry
it
on
by
that
time
too
she
knew
that
the
break
must
come
between
clayton
and
herself
if
it
came
at
all
no
letters
no
anything
clay
she
said
and
he
acquiesced
quietly
but
the
night
she
left
the
butler
coming
downstairs
to
investigate
a
suspicious
sound
found
him
restlessly
pacing
the
library
floor
in
august
he
went
abroad
and
some
time
about
the
middle
of
the
month
while
he
was
in
london
he
received
a
cable
from
graham
he
had
been
commissioned
a
first
lieutenant
in
the
infantry
clayton
had
been
seeing
war
at
first
hand
then
and
for
a
few
moments
he
was
fairly
terrified
on
that
first
of
august
the
germans
had
used
liquid
fire
for
the
first
time
thus
adding
a
new
horror
men
in
the
trenches
swept
by
it
had
been
practically
annihilated
attacks
against
it
were
practically
suicide
already
the
year
had
seen
the
last
of
kitchener
army
practically
destroyed
and
the
british
combing
the
country
for
new
divisions
in
the
deadly
give
and
take
of
that
summer
where
gains
and
losses
were
measured
by
yards
the
advantage
was
steadily
on
the
german
side
and
it
would
be
a
year
before
the
small
force
of
american
regulars
could
be
augmented
to
any
degree
by
the
great
new
army
it
was
the
darkest
hour
following
on
the
heels
of
graham
cable
came
a
hysterical
one
from
natalie
graham
probably
ordered
abroad
implore
you
use
influence
with
he
resorted
to
his
old
remedy
when
he
was
in
trouble
he
walked
the
streets
he
tried
to
allow
for
natalie
lack
of
exaltation
by
the
nature
of
her
life
if
she
could
have
seen
what
he
had
seen
surely
she
would
have
felt
as
he
did
that
no
sacrifice
could
be
too
great
to
end
this
cancer
of
the
world
but
deep
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
natalie
was
natalie
nothing
would
change
her
as
it
happened
he
passed
graham
on
the
atlantic
there
was
a
letter
for
him
at
the
office
a
boyish
exultant
letter
dad
dear
i
married
it
began
married
and
off
for
france
it
is
delight
of
course
it
always
was
delight
altho
i
know
that
sounds
queer
and
now
i
off
to
kill
a
hun
or
two
more
than
that
i
hope
i
want
two
germans
for
every
poor
devil
they
got
at
the
works
that
the
minimum
the
maximum
you
look
after
delight
i
know
she
has
been
perfectly
bully
but
it
hard
on
her
we
were
married
two
days
ago
and
already
i
feel
as
though
i
always
been
married
she
going
on
with
the
canteen
work
and
i
shall
try
not
to
be
jealous
she
popular
and
if
you
seen
the
general
when
we
were
married
you
have
thought
he
was
losing
a
daughter
i
wired
mother
but
she
was
too
cut
up
about
my
leaving
to
come
i
wish
she
had
for
it
was
a
strange
sort
of
wedding
the
division
was
about
to
move
and
at
the
last
minute
five
girls
turned
up
to
be
married
to
fellows
who
were
leaving
they
came
from
all
over
and
believe
me
there
was
some
excitement
all
day
the
general
and
chaplain
haverford
were
fussing
about
licenses
and
those
girls
sat
around
and
waited
and
looked
droopy
but
sort
of
happy
you
know
what
i
mean
it
was
nine
in
the
evening
before
everything
was
ready
delight
had
trimmed
up
the
little
church
which
is
in
the
camp
and
had
a
flag
over
the
altar
then
we
had
a
multiple
wedding
honestly
the
organ
played
a
squeaky
wedding
march
and
we
went
in
six
couples
the
church
was
full
of
soldiers
and
i
do
mind
saying
i
was
ready
to
shed
tears
we
lined
up
and
doctor
haverford
married
us
delight
says
she
is
sure
we
are
only
married
quiet
you
never
heard
such
quiet
except
for
the
general
blowing
his
nose
i
think
myself
he
was
weeping
and
there
was
a
rumor
about
the
camp
to
that
effect
you
know
the
flag
over
the
altar
and
all
that
i
tell
you
it
made
a
fellow
think
well
i
going
over
now
quick
work
is
it
and
to
think
that
a
few
months
ago
i
was
hanging
around
the
club
and
generally
making
a
mess
of
life
that
all
over
now
thank
god
i
going
to
make
good
try
to
buck
mother
up
it
pretty
hard
for
her
it
hard
for
all
women
just
waiting
and
while
i
know
i
coming
back
safe
and
sound
i
like
to
feel
that
you
are
going
to
keep
an
eye
on
delight
she
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
to
me
then
scrawled
in
a
corner
he
had
added
you
been
mighty
fine
with
me
always
dad
i
was
a
good
bit
of
a
pup
last
winter
if
i
make
anything
of
myself
at
all
it
will
be
because
i
want
to
be
like
clayton
sat
for
a
long
time
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
the
happiness
and
hope
that
fairly
radiated
from
it
cheered
and
warmed
him
he
was
nearly
happy
and
it
came
to
him
then
that
while
every
man
had
the
right
to
happiness
only
those
achieved
it
who
craved
it
for
others
and
having
craved
it
for
them
at
last
saw
the
realization
of
their
longing
chapter
xlvi
natalie
had
had
a
dull
spring
with
graham
departure
for
camp
she
moved
to
the
country
house
carrying
with
her
vast
amounts
of
luggage
the
innumerable
thing
large
and
small
which
were
necessary
for
her
comfort
the
installing
of
herself
in
her
new
and
luxurious
rooms
gave
her
occupation
for
several
days
she
liked
her
new
environment
she
liked
herself
in
it
the
taffetas
of
her
bedroom
brought
out
the
delicacy
of
her
skin
the
hangings
of
her
bed
small
and
draped
reflected
a
faint
color
into
her
face
and
the
morning
inspection
with
a
which
always
followed
her
coffee
showed
her
at
her
best
instead
of
her
worst
of
her
she
was
not
so
sure
it
walls
behind
whose
sliding
panels
were
hung
her
gowns
her
silk
and
satin
chiffon
negligees
her
wraps
and
summer
furs
all
the
vast
paraphernalia
with
which
she
armed
herself
as
a
knight
with
armor
the
walls
seemed
cold
she
hated
but
rodney
had
insisted
upon
he
had
held
a
bit
of
the
taffeta
to
her
cheek
it
is
delicious
natalie
he
said
it
makes
your
eyes
as
blue
as
the
always
a
decorator
she
had
replied
smiling
and
standing
in
her
blue
room
the
first
day
of
her
arrival
and
frowning
at
her
reflection
she
remembered
his
reply
because
i
have
no
right
with
you
to
be
anything
he
had
stopped
for
a
moment
and
had
absently
folded
and
refolded
the
bit
of
blue
silk
suddenly
he
said
what
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
do
now
that
our
work
together
is
done
have
you
ever
thought
about
that
natalie
you
are
coming
often
to
enjoy
your
handiwork
he
had
made
an
impulsive
gesture
i
not
coming
i
been
seeing
too
much
of
you
as
it
is
if
you
want
the
truth
i
just
wretchedly
unhappy
natalie
you
know
i
in
love
with
you
do
you
i
believe
you
think
you
do
he
almost
snarled
i
may
laugh
at
my
idiocy
but
you
have
any
right
to
i
know
i
ridiculous
i
known
it
for
months
but
it
pretty
serious
for
he
had
meant
it
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
that
it
is
the
curious
quality
of
very
selfish
women
that
they
inspire
a
certain
sort
of
love
they
are
likely
to
be
loved
often
even
tho
the
devotion
they
inspire
is
neither
deep
nor
lasting
big
and
women
are
loved
by
one
man
and
that
forever
natalie
had
not
laughed
but
she
had
done
what
was
almost
as
bad
she
had
patted
him
on
the
arm
do
talk
like
that
she
said
gently
you
are
all
i
have
now
rodney
and
i
do
want
to
lose
you
i
suffering
horribly
these
days
you
my
greatest
i
heard
you
say
that
of
a
as
for
loving
me
you
must
not
talk
like
that
under
the
circumstances
it
oh
he
had
said
and
looked
at
her
quickly
i
can
love
you
but
indelicate
to
tell
you
about
it
i
am
married
good
god
do
you
think
i
ever
forget
it
there
was
a
real
change
in
their
relationship
but
neither
of
them
understood
it
the
change
was
that
rodney
was
no
longer
playing
little
by
little
he
had
dropped
his
artistic
posing
for
her
benefit
his
cynical
cleverness
his
adroit
simulation
of
passion
he
no
longer
dramatized
himself
because
rather
often
he
forgot
himself
entirely
his
passion
had
ceased
to
be
spurious
and
it
was
none
the
less
real
because
he
loved
not
a
real
woman
but
one
of
his
own
artistic
creation
he
saw
in
natalie
a
misunderstood
and
suffering
woman
bearing
the
burdens
he
knew
of
with
dignity
and
a
certain
beauty
and
behind
her
slightly
theatrical
silences
he
guessed
at
other
griefs
nobly
borne
and
only
gently
intimated
he
developed
after
a
time
a
certain
suspicion
of
clayton
not
of
his
conduct
but
of
his
character
these
big
men
were
often
hard
it
was
that
quality
which
made
them
successful
they
married
tender
gentle
girls
and
then
repressed
and
trampled
on
them
natalie
became
in
his
mind
a
crushed
and
broken
thing
infinitely
lonely
and
pathetic
and
without
in
the
least
understanding
natalie
instinctively
knew
it
was
when
she
was
wistful
and
dependent
that
he
found
her
most
attractive
and
became
wistful
and
dependent
to
a
point
that
imposed
even
on
herself
i
been
very
selfish
with
you
rodney
dear
she
said
lifting
sad
eyes
to
his
i
am
going
to
be
better
you
must
come
often
this
summer
and
i
have
some
nice
girls
for
you
to
play
thank
you
he
said
stiffly
we
have
to
be
as
gay
as
we
can
she
sighed
i
just
a
little
dreary
these
days
you
it
was
rather
absurd
that
they
were
in
a
shop
and
that
the
clerk
should
return
just
then
with
curtain
cords
and
that
the
discussion
of
certain
shades
of
yellow
made
an
to
it
all
but
in
the
car
later
he
turned
to
her
roughly
you
need
ask
any
girls
for
me
he
said
i
only
want
one
woman
and
if
i
ca
have
her
i
do
want
any
at
first
the
very
fact
that
he
could
not
have
her
had
been
unconsciously
the
secret
of
her
attraction
she
was
a
perfect
thing
and
unattainable
he
could
sigh
for
her
with
longing
and
perfect
safety
but
as
time
went
on
with
that
incapacity
of
any
human
emotion
to
stand
still
but
either
to
go
on
or
to
go
back
his
passion
took
on
a
more
human
and
less
poetic
aspect
she
satisfied
him
less
and
he
wanted
more
for
one
thing
he
dreamed
that
strange
dream
of
mankind
of
making
ice
burn
of
turning
snow
to
fire
the
old
chimera
of
turning
the
cold
woman
to
warmth
through
his
own
passion
began
to
obsess
him
sometimes
he
watched
natalie
and
had
strange
fancies
he
saw
her
lit
from
within
by
a
fire
which
was
not
the
reflection
of
his
but
was
recklessly
her
own
how
wonderful
she
would
be
he
thought
and
at
those
times
he
had
wild
visions
of
going
away
with
her
into
some
beautiful
wilderness
and
there
teaching
her
what
she
had
missed
in
life
but
altho
now
he
always
wanted
her
he
was
not
always
thinking
of
a
wilderness
it
was
in
his
own
world
that
he
wanted
her
to
fit
beautifully
into
his
house
to
move
exquisitely
dressed
through
beside
him
he
wanted
her
at
those
times
as
the
most
perfect
of
all
his
treasures
he
was
still
a
collector
the
summer
only
served
to
increase
his
passion
during
the
long
hot
days
when
clayton
was
abroad
or
in
washington
or
working
late
at
night
as
he
frequently
did
how
they
were
much
together
plans
for
gayety
had
failed
dismally
the
city
and
the
country
houses
near
were
entirely
lacking
in
men
she
found
it
a
real
grievance
i
do
know
what
we
are
coming
to
she
complained
the
country
club
is
like
a
girl
i
wish
to
heaven
the
war
was
over
and
things
were
sensible
so
during
his
visits
they
spent
most
of
the
time
together
there
were
always
girls
there
and
now
and
then
a
few
men
who
always
explained
immediately
that
they
had
been
turned
down
for
the
service
or
were
going
in
the
fall
i
sure
somebody
has
to
stay
home
and
attend
to
things
here
she
said
to
him
one
august
night
but
even
when
they
are
in
america
they
are
rushing
about
pretending
to
do
things
one
would
think
to
see
clayton
that
he
is
the
entire
government
it
i
wish
i
could
go
he
said
unexpectedly
do
be
idiotic
you
much
too
not
as
old
as
oh
clay
he
in
a
class
by
she
laughed
lightly
where
is
he
now
in
france
i
think
probably
telling
them
how
to
run
the
when
is
he
coming
back
i
do
know
what
do
you
mean
by
wishing
you
could
go
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
not
if
it
well
i
will
and
it
not
very
agreeable
i
ca
keep
this
up
natalie
i
ca
keep
on
coming
here
being
in
clayton
house
and
eating
his
bread
while
i
in
love
with
his
wife
it
is
he
flung
away
his
cigaret
and
bent
forward
do
you
see
that
he
asked
gently
not
while
he
is
working
for
the
country
and
graham
is
i
do
see
why
war
needs
to
deprive
me
of
my
friends
i
lost
everything
his
morals
were
matters
of
his
private
life
and
they
had
been
neither
better
nor
worse
than
the
average
but
he
had
breeding
and
a
sure
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
and
this
present
visit
with
the
ostentatious
care
the
younger
crowd
took
to
allow
him
time
to
see
natalie
alone
was
galling
to
him
it
put
him
in
a
false
position
what
hurt
more
perhaps
in
an
unfavorable
light
the
war
had
changed
standards
too
men
were
being
measured
especially
by
women
and
those
who
failed
to
measure
up
were
being
eliminated
with
cruel
swiftness
especially
the
men
who
stayed
at
home
with
all
this
too
there
was
a
growing
admiration
for
clayton
spencer
in
their
small
circle
his
name
had
been
mentioned
in
connection
with
an
important
position
in
washington
in
the
clubs
there
was
considerable
praise
and
some
envy
and
rodney
knew
that
his
affair
with
natalie
was
the
subject
of
much
invidious
comment
do
you
love
him
he
asked
suddenly
i
why
of
course
i
do
you
mean
that
i
do
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
our
oh
friendship
you
know
how
i
feel
and
yet
you
go
on
bringing
up
that
silly
word
if
you
love
him
you
do
love
me
and
yet
you
let
me
hang
around
all
these
months
knowing
i
am
mad
about
you
you
play
the
game
what
do
you
want
to
say
if
you
do
love
clayton
why
do
you
tell
him
so
he
honest
enough
and
i
miss
my
guess
if
he
wants
a
wife
who
cares
for
somebody
she
sat
in
the
dusk
thinking
and
he
watched
her
she
looked
very
lovely
in
the
setting
which
he
himself
had
designed
for
her
she
hated
change
she
loathed
trouble
of
any
sort
and
she
was
those
days
just
a
little
afraid
of
that
strange
quiet
clayton
who
seemed
eternally
engrossed
in
war
and
the
things
of
war
she
glanced
about
at
the
white
trellises
that
gleamed
in
the
garden
at
the
silvery
fleur
de
lis
which
was
the
fountain
at
all
the
lovely
things
with
which
clayton
wealth
had
allowed
her
to
surround
herself
and
suddenly
she
knew
she
could
not
give
them
up
i
do
see
why
you
have
to
spoil
everything
she
said
fretfully
it
had
been
so
perfect
of
course
i
not
going
to
say
anything
to
clay
he
has
enough
to
worry
him
now
she
added
virtuously
suddenly
rodney
stooped
and
kissed
her
almost
savagely
then
i
going
he
said
and
to
her
great
surprise
he
went
alone
in
his
room
rodney
had
in
his
anger
a
glimpse
of
insight
he
saw
her
her
life
filled
with
small
emotions
lacking
the
courage
for
big
ones
he
saw
her
like
a
child
clutching
one
piece
of
cake
and
holding
out
a
hand
for
another
he
saw
her
taking
always
giving
never
she
not
worth
it
he
muttered
on
the
way
to
the
station
he
reflected
bitterly
over
the
past
year
he
did
not
blame
her
so
much
as
he
blamed
himself
he
had
been
playing
a
game
an
attractive
game
during
the
first
months
of
it
his
interest
in
natalie
had
been
subordinate
to
his
interest
in
her
house
he
had
been
creating
a
beautiful
thing
and
he
had
had
a
very
real
joy
in
it
but
lately
he
knew
that
his
work
on
the
house
had
been
that
he
might
build
a
background
for
natalie
he
had
put
into
it
the
best
of
his
ability
and
she
was
not
worth
it
for
some
days
he
neither
wrote
nor
called
her
up
he
was
not
happy
but
he
had
a
sense
of
relief
he
held
his
head
a
trifle
higher
was
his
own
man
again
and
he
began
to
make
tentative
inquiries
as
to
whether
he
could
be
useful
in
the
national
emergency
or
not
he
was
at
first
but
he
found
out
something
the
mere
fact
that
he
wanted
to
work
in
some
capacity
brought
back
some
of
his
old
friends
they
had
seemed
to
drop
away
before
but
they
came
back
heartily
and
with
hands
out
work
said
terry
mackenzie
at
the
club
one
day
looking
up
from
the
billiard
table
where
he
was
knocking
balls
about
rather
at
haphazard
why
of
course
you
can
work
what
about
these
new
cantonments
building
all
over
the
country
you
ought
to
be
useful
there
they
want
pretty
and
terry
had
laughed
but
he
put
down
his
cue
and
took
rodney
by
the
arm
let
ask
nolan
about
it
he
said
he
in
the
tearing
the
british
strategy
to
pieces
he
knows
everything
these
days
from
the
draft
law
to
the
month
shipping
losses
come
it
was
from
nolan
however
that
rodney
first
realized
how
seriously
clayton
friends
were
taking
his
affair
with
natalie
and
that
not
at
first
from
anything
he
said
it
was
an
indefinable
aloofness
of
manner
a
hostility
of
tone
nolan
never
troubled
himself
to
be
agreeable
unless
it
suited
his
inclination
and
apparently
terry
found
nothing
unusual
in
his
attitude
but
rodney
did
something
he
could
build
said
nolan
repeating
terry
question
how
do
i
know
there
a
lot
of
building
going
on
page
but
it
not
exactly
your
and
there
was
a
faint
note
of
contempt
in
his
voice
who
would
be
the
man
to
see
in
washington
rodney
inquired
i
look
it
up
and
let
you
know
you
might
call
me
up
old
terry
having
got
them
together
went
back
to
his
billiards
and
left
them
nolan
sat
down
and
picked
up
his
paper
with
an
air
of
ending
the
interview
but
he
put
it
down
again
as
rodney
turned
to
leave
the
room
page
yes
mind
having
a
few
minutes
talk
rodney
braced
himself
not
at
but
nolan
was
slow
to
begin
he
sat
newspaper
on
his
knee
his
eyes
thoughtful
when
he
began
it
was
slowly
i
am
one
of
clay
spencer
oldest
friends
he
said
he
a
white
man
the
whitest
man
i
know
naturally
anything
that
touches
him
touches
me
in
a
well
the
name
stands
for
a
good
bit
too
his
father
and
his
grandfather
were
the
same
sort
it
not
often
in
this
town
that
we
have
three
generations
without
a
breath
of
scandal
against
rodney
flushed
angrily
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
me
he
demanded
i
do
know
i
do
want
to
know
i
simply
wanted
to
tell
you
that
there
are
a
good
many
of
us
who
take
a
peculiar
pride
in
clayton
spencer
and
who
resent
anything
that
reflects
on
a
name
we
respect
rather
that
sounds
like
a
not
at
all
i
was
merely
calling
your
attention
to
something
i
thought
perhaps
you
had
then
he
got
up
and
his
tone
changed
became
brisk
almost
friendly
now
about
this
building
thing
if
you
in
earnest
i
think
it
can
be
managed
you
wo
get
any
money
to
speak
of
you
i
do
want
any
money
sullenly
fine
you
probably
have
to
go
west
somewhere
and
you
be
set
down
in
the
center
of
a
hundred
and
told
to
make
them
overnight
into
a
temporary
town
i
suppose
you
thought
of
all
that
i
go
wherever
i
come
along
to
the
telephone
rodney
hesitated
he
felt
cheap
and
despicable
and
his
anger
was
still
hot
they
wanted
to
get
him
out
of
town
he
saw
that
they
took
little
enough
trouble
to
hide
it
well
he
would
go
he
wanted
to
go
anyhow
and
he
would
show
them
something
too
if
he
got
a
chance
he
would
show
them
that
he
was
as
much
a
man
as
clayton
spencer
he
eyed
insolently
slouching
figure
with
furious
eyes
but
he
followed
him
had
he
secured
an
immediate
appointment
things
might
have
been
different
for
him
like
chris
valentine
he
had
had
one
decent
impulse
and
like
chris
too
there
was
a
woman
behind
it
but
chris
had
been
able
to
act
on
his
impulse
at
once
and
rodney
was
compelled
to
wait
while
the
mills
of
the
government
ground
slowly
then
on
the
fourteenth
of
august
natalie
telegraphed
him
have
had
bad
news
about
graham
can
you
come
he
thought
of
graham
ill
possibly
dead
and
he
took
the
next
train
late
in
the
evening
it
was
and
natalie
was
alone
he
had
thought
of
that
possibility
in
the
train
and
he
was
miserably
uncomfortable
with
all
his
joy
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
again
he
felt
that
the
emergency
must
be
his
justification
clayton
was
still
abroad
and
even
his
most
captious
critics
would
admit
that
natalie
should
have
a
friend
by
if
she
were
in
trouble
visions
of
graham
wounded
filled
his
mind
he
was
anxious
restless
and
in
a
state
of
the
highest
nervous
tension
and
there
was
no
real
emergency
he
found
natalie
in
the
pacing
the
floor
she
was
still
in
her
morning
dress
and
her
eyes
were
red
and
swollen
she
gave
him
both
her
hands
and
he
was
surprised
to
find
them
cold
as
ice
i
knew
you
would
come
she
said
i
am
so
alone
so
he
could
hardly
articulate
what
is
it
graham
has
been
ordered
he
stood
still
staring
at
her
and
then
he
dropped
her
hands
is
that
all
he
asked
dully
good
heavens
natalie
tell
me
i
been
frantic
with
anxiety
about
he
was
married
to
delight
and
still
he
stared
at
her
then
he
not
hurt
or
ill
i
did
say
he
was
good
gracious
rodney
is
that
bad
enough
but
what
did
you
expect
he
would
have
to
go
abroad
some
time
you
knew
that
i
sorry
but
why
in
god
name
did
you
say
in
your
wire
what
the
trouble
was
you
sound
exactly
like
she
was
entirely
incapable
of
understanding
she
stood
before
him
straight
and
resentful
and
yet
strangely
wistful
and
appealing
i
send
you
word
that
my
only
son
is
going
to
france
that
he
has
married
without
so
much
as
consulting
me
that
he
is
going
to
war
and
may
never
come
back
i
needed
you
and
you
said
once
that
when
i
needed
you
wherever
you
were
you
would
come
so
i
sent
for
you
and
now
you
act
like
like
have
you
any
one
here
the
servants
good
gracious
rodney
are
you
worrying
about
that
only
for
you
we
resent
anything
that
reflects
on
a
name
we
respect
rather
that
was
what
nolan
had
said
i
sorry
about
graham
dearest
i
am
sorry
about
any
trouble
that
comes
to
you
you
know
that
natalie
i
only
regretful
that
you
have
let
me
place
you
in
an
uncomfortable
position
if
my
being
here
is
known
look
here
natalie
dear
i
hate
to
bother
you
but
i
have
to
take
one
of
the
cars
and
go
back
to
the
city
are
you
being
rather
absurd
he
hesitated
he
could
not
tell
her
of
that
awkward
talk
with
nolan
there
were
many
things
he
would
not
tell
her
his
own
desire
to
rehabilitate
himself
among
the
men
he
knew
his
own
feeling
that
to
take
advantage
of
clayton
absence
on
business
connected
with
the
war
was
peculiarly
indefensible
i
shall
order
the
car
at
once
she
said
and
touched
a
bell
when
she
turned
he
was
just
behind
her
but
altho
he
held
out
his
arms
she
evaded
them
her
eyes
hard
and
angry
i
wish
you
would
try
to
understand
he
said
i
do
very
thoroughly
too
thoroughly
you
are
afraid
for
yourself
not
for
me
i
am
in
trouble
but
that
is
a
secondary
consideration
bother
about
me
rodney
i
have
borne
a
great
deal
alone
in
my
life
and
i
can
bear
she
turned
and
went
with
considerable
dignity
out
of
the
door
natalie
he
called
but
he
heard
her
with
a
gentle
rustle
of
silks
going
up
the
staircase
it
did
not
add
to
his
comfort
that
she
had
left
him
to
order
the
car
all
through
the
night
rodney
rode
and
thought
he
was
angry
at
natalie
but
he
was
angrier
at
himself
he
felt
that
he
had
been
brutal
unnecessarily
callous
after
all
her
only
son
was
on
his
way
to
war
it
was
on
the
cards
that
he
might
not
come
back
and
he
had
let
his
uneasiness
dominate
his
sympathy
he
had
lost
her
but
then
he
had
never
had
her
he
never
could
have
her
half
way
to
town
on
a
back
road
the
car
broke
down
and
after
vainly
endeavoring
to
start
it
the
chauffeur
set
off
on
foot
to
secure
help
rodney
slept
uncomfortably
and
wakened
with
the
movement
of
the
machine
to
find
it
broad
day
that
was
awkward
for
natalie
car
was
conspicuous
marked
too
with
her
initials
he
asked
to
be
set
down
at
a
suburban
railway
station
and
was
dismayed
to
find
it
crowded
with
early
commuters
who
stared
at
the
big
car
with
interest
on
the
platform
eyeing
him
with
unfriendly
eyes
was
nolan
rodney
made
a
movement
toward
him
the
situation
was
intolerable
absurd
but
nolan
turned
his
back
and
proceeded
to
read
his
newspaper
perhaps
not
in
years
had
rodney
page
faced
the
truth
about
himself
so
clearly
as
he
did
that
morning
riding
into
the
city
on
the
train
which
carried
somewhere
ahead
that
quietly
contemptuous
figure
that
was
denis
nolan
faced
the
truth
saw
himself
for
what
he
was
and
loathed
the
thing
he
saw
for
a
little
time
too
it
was
given
him
to
see
natalie
for
what
she
was
for
what
she
would
always
be
her
sole
contribution
to
life
the
web
of
her
selfishness
carefully
woven
floating
apparently
aimlessly
and
yet
snaring
and
holding
relentlessly
whatever
it
touched
killing
freedom
he
saw
clayton
and
graham
and
himself
feeders
for
her
monstrous
complacency
and
vanity
and
he
made
a
definite
determination
to
free
himself
i
through
he
reflected
savagely
i
show
them
something
too
i
he
hesitated
how
lovely
she
was
and
she
cared
for
him
she
was
small
and
selfish
and
unspeakably
vain
but
she
cared
for
him
the
war
had
done
something
for
rodney
page
he
no
longer
dreamed
the
old
dream
of
turning
her
ice
to
fire
but
he
dreamed
for
a
moment
something
finer
he
saw
natalie
his
and
growing
big
and
fine
through
love
he
saw
himself
and
natalie
like
cards
in
the
game
of
life
a
new
combination
a
winning
hand
chapter
xlvii
very
quietly
audrey
had
taken
herself
out
of
clayton
life
she
sent
him
a
little
note
of
farewell
we
have
had
ten
very
wonderful
months
clay
she
wrote
we
ought
to
be
very
happy
so
few
have
as
much
and
we
both
know
that
this
go
on
i
am
going
abroad
i
have
an
opportunity
to
go
over
and
see
what
englishwomen
are
doing
in
the
way
of
standing
behind
their
men
at
war
then
i
am
to
tell
our
women
at
home
not
that
they
need
it
now
bless
them
i
believe
you
will
be
glad
to
know
that
i
am
to
be
on
the
same
side
of
the
ocean
with
graham
i
could
get
to
him
i
think
if
anything
should
go
wrong
will
you
send
him
the
enclosed
address
but
my
dear
the
address
is
for
him
not
for
you
you
must
not
write
to
me
i
have
used
up
every
particle
of
moral
courage
i
possess
as
it
is
and
i
am
holding
this
in
my
mind
as
you
must
time
is
a
great
healer
of
all
wounds
we
could
have
been
happy
together
oh
my
dear
so
very
happy
together
now
that
i
am
going
let
me
be
frank
for
once
i
have
given
you
the
finest
thing
i
am
capable
of
i
am
better
for
caring
for
you
as
i
have
as
i
do
but
those
days
in
the
hospital
told
me
we
could
go
on
things
like
that
do
stand
still
maybe
we
are
only
human
clay
maybe
if
the
old
days
were
still
here
we
might
have
compromised
with
life
i
do
know
but
i
do
know
that
we
never
will
now
after
all
we
have
had
a
great
deal
and
we
still
have
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
to
know
that
somewhere
in
the
world
is
some
one
person
who
loves
you
to
waken
up
in
the
morning
to
it
to
go
to
sleep
remembering
it
and
to
have
kept
that
love
fine
and
clean
is
a
wonderful
thing
too
i
am
not
always
on
a
pinnacle
there
have
been
plenty
of
times
when
the
mere
human
want
of
you
has
sent
me
to
the
dust
is
it
wrong
to
tell
you
that
but
of
course
not
you
know
it
but
you
and
i
know
this
clay
dear
love
that
is
hopeless
that
can
not
end
in
marriage
does
one
of
two
things
either
it
degrades
or
it
exalts
it
leaves
its
mark
always
but
that
mark
does
not
need
to
be
a
clayton
lived
for
a
time
after
that
in
a
world
very
empty
and
very
full
the
new
plant
was
well
under
way
not
only
was
he
about
to
make
shells
for
the
government
at
a
nominal
profit
but
washington
was
asking
him
to
assume
new
and
wide
responsibilities
he
accepted
he
wanted
so
to
fill
the
hours
that
there
would
be
no
time
to
remember
but
more
than
that
he
was
actuated
by
a
fine
and
glowing
desire
to
serve
perhaps
underlying
it
all
was
the
determination
to
be
in
every
way
the
man
audrey
thought
him
to
be
and
there
was
too
a
resolution
to
put
behind
graham
and
other
boys
like
graham
all
the
shells
and
ammunition
they
needed
he
worked
hard
more
than
hard
old
terry
meeting
him
one
day
in
the
winter
that
followed
was
shocked
at
his
haggard
face
better
take
a
little
time
off
clay
he
suggested
we
going
to
miami
next
week
how
about
ten
days
or
so
fishing
is
good
this
ca
very
well
take
a
holiday
just
now
too
much
to
do
old
terry
went
home
and
told
his
wife
looks
like
the
devil
he
said
he
go
down
sick
one
of
these
days
i
suppose
it
no
use
telling
none
whatever
said
terry
and
anyhow
it
a
thing
i
care
to
tell
what
do
you
mean
not
care
to
tell
natalie
hard
work
does
make
a
man
forget
how
to
oh
come
now
he
cheerful
enough
if
you
mean
because
fighting
that
only
part
of
it
said
terry
sagely
and
relapsed
into
one
of
the
poignant
silences
that
drove
old
terry
to
a
perfect
frenzy
of
curiosity
then
in
january
of
a
crisis
came
to
clayton
and
natalie
spencer
graham
was
wounded
clayton
was
at
home
when
the
news
came
natalie
had
been
having
one
of
her
meticulously
elaborate
and
when
the
guests
had
gone
they
were
for
a
moment
alone
in
the
of
their
town
house
clayton
was
fighting
in
himself
the
sense
of
irritation
natalie
dinners
always
left
especially
the
recent
ones
she
was
serving
he
knew
too
much
food
in
the
midst
of
the
agitation
on
conservation
her
dinners
ran
their
customary
seven
courses
there
was
too
much
wine
too
but
it
occurred
to
him
that
only
the
wine
had
made
the
dinner
endurable
then
he
tried
to
force
himself
into
better
humor
natalie
was
as
she
was
and
if
in
an
unhappy
struggling
dying
world
she
found
happiness
in
display
god
knew
there
was
little
enough
happiness
he
was
not
at
home
very
often
he
could
not
spoil
her
almost
childish
content
in
the
small
things
that
made
up
her
life
i
think
it
was
very
successful
she
said
surveying
herself
in
one
of
the
corner
mirrors
do
you
like
my
gown
clay
it
very
it
new
i
been
getting
some
clothes
clay
you
probably
shriek
at
the
bills
but
all
this
talk
about
not
buying
clothes
is
nonsense
you
know
the
girls
who
work
in
the
shops
have
to
naturally
of
course
there
is
other
work
open
to
them
in
munition
plants
i
daresay
to
be
blown
up
he
winced
the
thought
of
that
night
the
year
before
when
the
plant
went
still
turned
him
sick
do
buy
too
many
things
my
dear
he
said
gently
you
know
how
things
i
know
it
your
fault
that
they
are
as
they
are
she
persisted
oh
i
know
it
was
noble
of
you
and
all
that
the
country
crazy
about
you
but
still
i
think
it
was
silly
every
one
else
is
making
money
out
of
things
and
you
a
lot
of
thanks
you
get
when
the
war
i
do
particularly
want
then
the
rang
in
the
back
of
the
house
and
buckham
answered
it
he
was
conscious
at
once
that
natalie
stiffened
and
that
she
was
watchful
and
a
trifle
pale
buckham
brought
in
a
telegram
on
a
tray
give
it
to
me
buckham
natalie
said
in
a
strained
voice
and
held
out
her
hand
for
it
when
she
saw
it
was
for
clayton
however
she
relaxed
as
he
tore
it
open
clayton
was
thinking
evidently
natalie
had
been
afraid
of
his
seeing
some
message
for
her
was
it
possible
that
natalie
he
opened
it
after
what
seemed
a
long
time
he
looked
up
her
eyes
were
on
him
do
be
alarmed
my
dear
he
said
it
is
not
very
bad
but
graham
has
been
slightly
wounded
sit
down
he
said
sharply
as
he
saw
her
sway
you
are
lying
to
me
she
said
in
a
dreadful
voice
he
dead
he
is
not
dead
he
tried
to
put
her
into
a
chair
but
she
resisted
him
fiercely
let
me
alone
i
want
to
see
that
and
very
reluctantly
at
last
he
gave
it
to
her
graham
was
severely
wounded
it
was
from
a
man
in
his
own
department
at
washington
who
had
just
seen
the
official
list
the
nature
of
his
wounding
had
not
been
stated
natalie
looked
up
from
the
telegram
with
a
face
like
a
painted
mask
this
is
your
doing
she
said
you
wanted
him
to
go
you
sent
him
into
this
he
will
die
and
you
will
have
murdered
the
thought
came
to
him
in
that
hour
of
stress
that
she
was
right
pitifully
damnably
right
he
had
not
wanted
graham
to
go
but
he
had
wanted
him
to
want
to
go
a
thousand
thoughts
flashed
through
his
mind
of
delight
sleeping
somewhere
quietly
after
her
day
work
at
the
camp
of
graham
himself
of
that
morning
after
the
explosion
and
his
frank
pitiful
confession
and
again
of
graham
suffering
perhaps
dying
and
with
none
of
his
own
about
him
and
through
it
all
was
the
feeling
that
he
must
try
to
bring
natalie
to
reason
that
it
was
incredible
that
she
should
call
him
his
own
son
murderer
we
must
not
think
of
his
dying
he
said
we
must
only
think
that
he
is
going
to
live
and
to
come
back
to
us
natalie
she
flung
off
the
arm
he
put
around
her
and
that
he
went
on
feeling
for
words
out
of
the
dreadful
confusion
in
his
mind
if
the
worst
comes
that
he
has
done
a
magnificent
thing
there
is
no
greater
thing
that
wo
bring
him
back
to
us
she
said
still
in
that
frozen
voice
and
suddenly
she
burst
into
hard
terrible
crying
all
that
night
he
sat
outside
her
door
for
she
would
not
allow
him
to
come
in
he
had
had
washington
on
the
telephone
but
when
at
last
he
got
the
connection
it
was
to
learn
that
no
further
details
were
known
toward
dawn
there
came
the
official
telegram
from
the
war
department
but
it
told
nothing
more
natalie
was
hysterical
he
had
sent
for
a
doctor
and
with
madeleine
in
attendance
the
medical
man
had
worked
over
her
for
hours
going
out
toward
morning
he
had
found
clayton
in
the
hall
and
had
looked
at
him
sharply
better
go
to
bed
spencer
he
advised
it
may
not
be
as
bad
as
you
think
and
they
doing
fine
surgery
over
and
as
clayton
shook
his
head
mrs
spencer
will
come
round
all
right
she
hysterical
naturally
she
be
sending
for
you
before
with
the
dawn
clayton
thoughts
cleared
if
he
and
natalie
were
ever
to
get
together
at
all
it
should
be
now
with
this
common
grief
between
them
perhaps
after
all
it
was
not
too
late
to
his
house
of
life
he
had
failed
perhaps
they
had
both
failed
but
the
real
responsibility
was
his
inside
the
room
he
could
hear
her
moaning
a
low
monotonous
moan
he
was
terribly
sorry
for
her
she
had
no
exaltation
to
help
her
no
strength
of
soul
no
strength
of
any
sort
and
as
men
will
under
stress
he
tried
to
make
a
bargain
with
his
god
let
him
live
he
prayed
bring
him
back
to
us
and
i
will
try
again
i
do
better
i
been
a
rotten
failure
as
far
as
she
is
concerned
but
i
he
felt
somewhat
better
after
that
altho
he
felt
a
certain
ignominy
too
that
always
until
such
a
time
he
had
gone
on
his
own
as
it
were
and
that
now
when
he
no
longer
sufficed
for
himself
he
should
beseech
the
almighty
natalie
had
had
a
and
at
last
he
heard
her
moaning
cease
and
the
stealthy
movements
of
her
maid
as
she
lowered
the
window
shades
it
was
dawn
during
the
next
two
days
clayton
worked
as
he
never
had
worked
before
still
perhaps
with
that
unspoken
pact
in
mind
worked
too
to
forget
he
had
sent
several
cables
but
no
reply
came
until
the
third
day
he
did
not
sleep
at
night
he
did
not
even
go
to
bed
he
sat
in
the
low
chair
in
his
dozing
occasionally
to
waken
with
a
start
at
some
sound
in
the
hall
now
and
again
as
the
trained
nurse
who
was
watching
natalie
at
night
moved
about
the
hallways
he
would
sit
up
expecting
a
summons
that
did
not
come
she
still
refused
to
see
him
it
depressed
and
frightened
him
for
how
could
he
fulfill
his
part
of
the
compact
when
she
so
sullenly
shut
him
out
of
her
life
he
was
singularly
simple
in
his
fundamental
beliefs
there
was
a
great
power
somewhere
call
it
what
one
might
and
it
dealt
out
justice
or
mercy
as
one
deserved
it
on
that
of
course
had
been
built
an
elaborate
edifice
of
creed
and
dogma
but
curiously
enough
it
all
fell
away
now
he
was
in
those
night
hours
again
the
boy
who
had
prayed
for
fair
weather
for
circus
day
and
had
promised
in
return
to
read
his
bible
through
during
the
next
year
and
had
done
it
in
the
daytime
however
he
was
a
man
suffering
terribly
and
facing
the
complexities
of
his
life
alone
one
thing
he
knew
this
was
decisive
either
under
the
stress
of
a
common
trouble
he
and
natalie
would
come
together
to
make
the
best
they
could
of
the
years
to
come
or
they
would
be
hopelessly
alienated
but
that
was
secondary
to
graham
everything
was
secondary
to
graham
indeed
he
had
cabled
audrey
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
when
on
the
third
day
a
cable
came
from
her
she
had
located
graham
at
last
he
had
been
shot
in
the
chest
and
there
were
pneumonia
symptoms
shall
stay
with
him
she
ended
and
shall
send
daily
next
to
his
god
he
put
his
faith
in
audrey
almost
he
prayed
to
her
dunbar
now
a
captain
in
the
military
intelligence
bureau
visiting
him
in
his
office
one
day
found
clayton
face
an
interesting
study
old
lines
of
repression
new
ones
of
anxiety
marked
him
deeply
the
boy
of
course
he
thought
and
then
reflected
that
it
takes
time
to
carve
such
lines
as
were
written
in
the
face
of
the
man
across
the
desk
from
him
time
and
a
woman
he
considered
shrewdly
his
mind
harked
back
to
that
dinner
in
the
spencer
house
when
diplomatic
relations
had
been
broken
off
with
germany
and
war
seemed
imminent
it
was
the
wife
probably
he
remembered
that
she
had
been
opposed
to
war
and
to
the
boy
going
there
were
such
women
in
the
country
there
were
fewer
of
them
all
the
time
but
they
existed
women
who
saw
in
war
only
sacrifice
women
who
counted
no
cost
too
high
for
peace
if
they
only
hurt
themselves
it
did
not
matter
but
they
could
and
did
do
incredible
damage
clayton
was
going
through
some
papers
he
had
brought
and
dunbar
had
time
to
consider
what
to
him
was
an
interesting
problem
spencer
had
kept
the
boy
from
immediate
enlistment
he
had
wanted
to
go
dunbar
knew
that
if
she
had
allowed
him
to
go
the
affair
with
anna
klein
would
have
been
ended
he
knew
all
that
story
now
then
if
there
had
been
no
affair
herman
would
not
have
blown
up
the
munition
works
and
a
good
many
lives
valuable
to
themselves
at
least
might
have
been
saved
curious
he
reflected
one
woman
and
she
probably
sleeps
well
at
nights
and
goes
to
church
on
sundays
clayton
passed
back
his
papers
and
ran
a
hand
over
his
heavy
hair
they
seem
to
be
all
right
he
said
dunbar
rose
hope
the
next
news
will
be
better
i
hope
i
have
told
you
i
think
that
we
have
traced
rudolph
clayton
face
set
he
got
away
unfortunately
over
the
border
into
mexico
they
have
a
regular
system
there
the
germans
an
underground
railway
to
mexico
city
they
have
a
paymaster
on
our
side
of
the
line
they
even
bank
in
one
of
our
banks
oh
we
get
them
yet
of
course
but
damnably
i
suppose
there
is
no
hope
of
getting
rudolph
klein
not
while
the
germans
are
running
mexico
captain
dunbar
replied
dryly
he
living
in
a
mexican
town
just
over
the
border
watching
him
if
he
puts
a
foot
on
this
side
we
grab
clayton
sat
back
after
he
had
gone
he
was
in
his
old
office
at
the
mill
where
joey
had
once
formed
his
unofficial
partnership
with
the
firm
outside
in
the
mill
yard
there
was
greater
activity
than
ever
but
many
of
the
faces
were
new
the
engineer
who
had
once
run
the
yard
engine
was
building
bridges
in
france
hutchinson
had
heard
the
call
and
was
learning
to
fly
in
florida
the
service
flag
over
his
office
door
showed
hundreds
of
stars
and
more
were
being
added
constantly
joey
dead
graham
wounded
his
family
life
on
the
verge
of
disruption
and
audrey
then
out
of
the
chaos
there
came
an
exaltation
he
had
given
himself
his
son
the
wealth
he
had
hoped
to
have
but
thank
god
he
had
had
something
to
give
there
were
men
who
could
give
nothing
like
old
terry
mackenzie
knocking
around
at
the
club
and
profanely
wistful
that
he
had
had
no
son
to
go
his
mind
ranged
over
those
pathetic
prosperous
sonless
men
who
filed
into
the
club
late
in
the
afternoons
and
over
the
last
editions
and
fought
their
futile
warfare
their
a
newspaper
map
their
upraised
voices
their
only
weapons
on
parade
days
when
the
long
lines
of
boys
in
khaki
went
by
they
were
silent
heavy
inutile
they
were
too
old
to
fight
the
biggest
thing
in
their
lives
was
passing
them
by
as
passed
the
lines
of
marching
boys
and
they
had
no
part
in
it
they
were
feeding
their
hungry
spirits
on
the
dregs
of
war
on
committee
meetings
and
public
gatherings
and
they
were
being
useful
but
the
great
exaltation
of
offering
their
best
was
not
for
them
he
was
living
a
tragedy
but
a
greater
tragedy
was
that
of
the
childless
and
back
of
that
again
was
the
woman
who
had
not
wanted
children
there
were
many
men
who
were
feeling
the
selfishness
of
a
woman
at
home
men
who
had
lost
somehow
their
pride
their
feeling
of
being
a
part
of
great
things
men
who
went
home
at
night
to
comfortable
dwellings
with
no
vacant
chair
at
the
table
and
dined
in
a
peace
they
had
not
earned
natalie
had
at
least
given
him
a
son
he
took
that
thought
home
with
him
in
the
evening
he
stopped
at
a
florist
and
bought
a
great
box
of
flowers
for
her
and
sent
them
into
her
room
with
a
little
note
wo
you
let
me
come
in
and
try
to
comfort
you
but
madeleine
brought
the
box
out
again
and
there
was
pity
in
her
eyes
mrs
spencer
can
not
have
them
in
the
room
sir
she
says
the
odor
of
flowers
makes
her
he
knew
madeleine
had
invented
the
excuse
that
natalie
had
simply
rejected
his
offering
he
went
and
made
a
pretense
of
dining
alone
in
the
great
room
it
was
there
that
audrey
daily
cable
found
him
buckham
brought
it
in
in
shaking
fingers
and
stood
by
white
and
still
while
he
opened
it
clayton
stood
up
he
was
very
white
but
his
voice
was
full
and
strong
he
is
better
buckham
better
suddenly
buckham
was
crying
his
austere
face
was
distorted
his
lean
body
trembling
clayton
put
his
arm
around
the
bowed
old
shoulders
and
in
that
moment
as
they
stood
there
master
and
man
clayton
spencer
had
a
flash
of
revelation
there
was
love
and
love
the
love
of
a
man
for
a
woman
and
of
a
woman
for
a
man
of
a
mother
for
the
child
at
her
knee
of
that
child
for
its
mother
but
that
the
great
actuating
motive
of
a
man
maturity
of
the
middle
span
was
vested
along
with
his
dreams
his
pride
and
his
love
in
his
son
his
buckham
carrying
his
coffee
into
the
library
somewhat
later
found
him
with
his
head
down
on
his
desk
and
the
cablegram
clutched
in
his
outstretched
hands
he
out
very
quietly
chapter
xlviii
clayton
first
impulse
was
to
take
the
cable
to
natalie
to
brush
aside
the
absurd
defenses
she
had
erected
and
behind
which
she
cowered
terrified
but
obstinate
to
say
to
her
he
is
living
he
is
going
to
live
but
this
war
is
not
over
yet
if
we
want
him
to
come
through
we
must
stand
together
we
must
deserve
to
have
him
come
back
to
but
by
the
time
he
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
knew
he
could
not
do
it
she
would
not
understand
she
would
think
he
was
using
graham
to
further
a
reconciliation
and
after
her
first
joy
was
over
he
knew
that
he
would
see
again
that
cynical
smile
that
always
implied
that
he
was
dramatizing
himself
nothing
could
dim
his
strong
inner
joy
but
something
of
its
outer
glow
faded
he
would
go
to
her
later
not
now
nothing
must
spoil
this
great
thankfulness
of
his
he
gave
madeleine
the
cable
and
went
down
again
to
the
library
after
a
time
he
began
to
go
over
the
events
of
the
past
eighteen
months
his
return
from
the
continent
and
that
curious
sense
of
unrest
that
had
followed
it
the
opening
of
his
eyes
to
the
futility
of
his
life
his
failure
to
natalie
and
her
failure
to
him
graham
made
a
man
by
war
and
by
the
love
of
a
good
woman
chris
ending
his
sordid
life
in
a
blaze
of
glory
and
forever
forgiven
his
tawdry
sins
because
of
his
one
big
hour
war
took
but
it
gave
also
it
had
taken
joey
for
instance
but
joey
had
had
his
great
moment
it
was
better
to
have
one
great
moment
and
die
than
to
drag
on
through
useless
years
and
it
was
the
same
way
with
a
nation
a
nation
needed
its
hour
it
was
only
in
a
crisis
that
it
could
know
its
own
strength
how
many
of
them
who
had
been
at
that
dinner
of
natalie
months
before
had
met
their
crisis
bravely
nolan
was
in
france
now
doctor
haverford
was
at
the
front
audrey
was
nursing
graham
marion
hayden
was
in
a
hospital
rodney
page
was
still
building
wooden
barracks
in
a
cantonment
in
indiana
and
was
making
good
he
himself
they
could
never
go
back
none
of
them
to
the
old
smug
complacent
luxurious
days
they
could
no
more
go
back
than
joey
could
return
to
life
again
war
was
the
irrevocable
step
as
final
as
death
itself
and
he
remembered
something
nolan
had
said
just
before
he
sailed
we
have
had
one
advantage
clay
or
maybe
it
is
not
an
advantage
after
all
do
you
realize
that
you
and
i
have
lived
through
the
golden
age
we
have
seen
it
come
and
seen
it
go
the
greatest
height
of
civilization
since
the
world
began
the
greatest
achievements
the
most
opulent
living
and
we
saw
it
all
crash
it
will
be
a
thousand
years
before
the
world
will
be
ready
for
and
later
i
suppose
every
life
has
its
golden
age
generally
we
think
it
is
youth
i
not
so
sure
youth
is
looking
ahead
it
has
its
hopes
and
its
disappointments
the
golden
age
in
a
man
life
ought
to
be
the
age
of
fulfillment
it
nearer
the
forties
than
the
have
you
reached
it
i
going
to
on
the
other
and
clayton
had
smiled
you
are
going
to
reach
it
he
said
we
are
always
going
to
find
it
nolan
it
is
always
just
and
nolan
had
given
him
one
of
his
quick
understanding
glances
there
could
be
no
golden
age
for
him
for
the
golden
age
for
a
man
meant
fulfillment
the
time
came
to
every
man
when
he
must
sit
at
the
west
window
of
his
house
of
life
and
look
toward
the
sunset
if
he
faced
that
sunset
alone
he
heard
madeleine
carrying
down
natalie
and
when
she
left
the
pantry
she
came
to
the
door
of
the
library
mrs
spencer
would
like
to
see
you
thank
you
madeleine
i
go
up
very
suddenly
he
knew
that
he
did
not
want
to
go
up
to
natalie
scented
room
she
had
shut
him
out
when
she
was
in
trouble
she
had
not
cared
that
he
too
was
in
distress
she
had
done
her
best
to
invalidate
that
compact
he
had
made
she
had
always
invalidated
him
to
go
back
to
the
old
way
to
the
tribute
she
enforced
to
feed
her
inordinate
vanity
to
the
old
hypocrisy
of
their
relationship
to
live
again
the
old
lie
was
impossible
he
got
up
he
would
not
try
to
buy
himself
happiness
at
the
cost
of
turning
her
adrift
but
he
must
some
way
buy
his
he
heard
her
then
on
the
staircase
that
soft
rustle
which
it
seemed
to
him
had
rasped
the
silk
of
his
nerves
all
their
years
together
with
its
insistence
on
her
dainty
helplessness
her
femininity
her
right
to
protection
the
tap
of
her
high
heels
came
closer
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
turned
determinedly
smiling
to
face
the
door
almost
at
once
he
saw
that
she
was
frightened
she
had
taken
pains
to
look
her
best
but
then
she
always
did
that
she
was
rouged
to
the
eyes
and
the
floating
white
chiffon
of
her
negligee
gave
to
her
slim
body
the
illusion
of
youth
that
last
illusion
to
which
she
so
desperately
clung
but
she
was
frightened
she
stood
in
the
doorway
one
hand
holding
aside
the
heavy
velvet
curtain
and
looked
at
him
with
wide
penciled
eyes
clay
yes
come
in
shall
i
have
buckham
light
a
fire
she
came
in
slowly
do
you
suppose
that
cable
is
reliable
i
should
think
he
may
have
a
we
must
worry
about
what
may
come
he
is
better
now
the
chances
are
that
he
stay
probably
i
suppose
because
i
have
been
so
ill
he
felt
the
demand
for
sympathy
but
he
had
none
to
give
and
he
felt
something
else
natalie
was
floundering
an
odd
word
for
her
always
so
sure
of
herself
she
was
frightened
unsure
of
herself
and
floundering
why
are
you
going
to
be
in
she
gave
a
curious
little
gesture
then
she
evidently
made
up
her
mind
and
she
faced
him
defiantly
of
course
if
i
had
known
he
was
going
to
be
better
i
clay
i
wired
yesterday
for
rodney
page
he
arrives
rodney
i
do
think
i
quite
understand
natalie
why
did
you
wire
for
him
you
would
understand
of
course
i
was
in
trouble
he
has
been
my
best
friend
i
tried
to
bear
it
alone
but
i
could
i
alone
you
would
see
i
could
why
because
if
graham
had
died
her
mouth
trembled
she
put
her
hand
to
her
throat
you
would
have
blamed
me
for
his
death
then
even
now
if
the
sheer
cruelty
of
it
sent
him
pale
yet
it
was
not
so
much
deliberate
as
unconscious
she
was
forcing
herself
to
an
unwonted
honesty
it
was
her
honest
conviction
that
he
was
responsible
for
graham
wounding
and
danger
let
me
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
he
said
quietly
you
hold
me
responsible
very
well
how
far
does
that
take
us
how
far
does
that
take
you
to
rodney
you
need
be
brutal
rodney
understands
me
he
he
cares
for
me
i
see
and
since
you
sent
for
him
i
take
it
you
care
for
i
do
know
i
is
it
time
you
do
know
for
god
sake
natalie
make
up
your
mind
to
some
course
and
stick
to
but
accustomed
as
he
was
to
the
curious
turns
of
her
mind
he
was
still
astounded
to
have
her
turn
on
him
and
accuse
him
of
trying
to
get
rid
of
her
it
was
not
until
later
that
he
realized
in
that
attitude
of
hers
her
old
instinct
of
shifting
the
responsibility
from
her
own
shoulders
and
then
rodney
was
announced
the
unreality
of
the
situation
persisted
rodney
strained
face
and
uneasy
manner
his
uniform
the
blank
pause
when
he
had
learned
that
graham
was
better
and
when
the
ordinary
banalities
of
greeting
were
over
beside
clayton
he
looked
small
dapper
and
wretchedly
uncomfortable
and
yet
even
clayton
had
to
acknowledge
a
sort
of
dignity
in
the
man
he
felt
sorry
for
him
for
the
disillusion
that
was
to
come
and
at
the
same
time
he
felt
an
angry
contempt
for
him
that
he
should
have
forced
so
theatrical
a
situation
that
the
night
which
saw
graham
beginning
recovery
should
be
tarnished
by
the
wild
clutch
after
happiness
of
two
people
who
had
done
so
little
to
earn
it
he
saw
another
totally
different
scene
for
a
moment
he
saw
graham
in
his
narrow
bed
that
night
in
some
hospital
ward
and
he
saw
audrey
beside
him
watching
and
waiting
and
praying
a
wild
desire
to
be
over
there
one
of
that
little
group
almost
overcame
him
and
instead
natalie
has
not
been
well
rodney
he
said
i
rather
think
if
you
have
anything
to
say
to
me
we
would
better
talk
natalie
went
out
her
draperies
trailing
behind
her
clayton
listened
as
she
moved
slowly
up
the
stairs
for
the
last
time
he
heard
that
soft
rustling
which
had
been
the
accompaniment
to
so
many
of
the
most
poignant
hours
of
his
life
he
listened
until
it
had
died
away
chapter
xlix
for
months
rudolph
klein
had
been
living
in
a
little
mexican
town
on
the
border
there
were
really
two
towns
but
they
were
built
together
with
only
a
strip
of
a
hundred
feet
between
along
this
strip
ran
the
border
itself
with
a
tent
pitched
on
the
american
side
and
patrols
of
soldiers
guarding
it
the
american
side
was
bright
and
clean
orderly
and
but
only
a
hundred
feet
away
unkempt
dusty
with
adobe
buildings
and
a
notorious
in
plain
view
was
mexico
itself
leisurely
improvident
not
overscrupulous
mexico
at
first
rudolph
was
fairly
contented
it
amused
him
he
liked
the
idleness
of
it
he
liked
kicking
the
innumerable
mexican
dogs
out
of
his
way
he
liked
baiting
the
croupiers
in
the
he
liked
wandering
into
that
notorious
resort
and
shoving
hindus
chinamen
and
mexicans
out
of
the
way
while
he
flung
down
a
silver
dollar
and
watched
the
dealers
with
cunning
avaricious
eyes
he
liked
his
own
situation
too
it
amused
him
to
think
that
here
he
was
safe
while
only
a
hundred
feet
away
he
was
a
criminal
fugitive
from
the
law
he
liked
to
go
to
the
very
border
itself
and
jeer
at
the
men
on
guard
there
if
i
was
on
that
side
he
would
say
you
have
me
in
one
of
those
rotten
uniforms
would
you
come
on
over
fellows
the
then
one
day
a
chinaman
he
had
insulted
gave
him
an
unexpected
shove
and
he
had
managed
to
save
himself
by
a
foot
from
the
clutch
of
a
man
in
plain
clothes
who
spent
a
certain
amount
of
time
lounging
on
the
other
side
of
the
border
that
had
sobered
him
he
kept
away
from
the
border
itself
after
that
although
the
temptation
of
it
drew
him
after
a
few
weeks
when
the
novelty
had
worn
off
he
began
to
hunger
for
the
clean
little
american
town
across
the
line
he
wanted
to
talk
to
some
one
he
wanted
to
boast
to
be
candid
these
mexicans
only
laughed
when
he
bragged
to
them
but
he
dared
not
cross
there
was
a
enclosure
behind
the
owl
the
segregated
district
of
the
town
there
in
tiny
houses
built
in
rows
like
barracks
were
the
girls
and
women
who
had
drifted
to
this
place
of
the
world
in
the
daytime
they
slept
or
sat
on
the
narrow
ramshackle
porches
untidy
noisy
unspeakably
wretched
at
night
however
they
blossomed
forth
in
tawdry
finery
in
the
behind
the
some
of
them
were
fixtures
they
had
drifted
there
from
new
orleans
perhaps
or
southern
california
and
they
lacked
the
initiative
or
the
money
to
get
away
but
most
of
them
came
in
stayed
a
month
or
two
found
the
place
a
nightmare
with
its
shootings
and
stabbings
and
then
disappeared
at
first
rudolph
was
popular
in
this
hell
of
the
underworld
he
spent
money
easily
he
danced
well
he
had
audacity
and
a
sort
of
sardonic
humor
they
asked
no
questions
those
poor
wretches
who
had
themselves
slid
over
the
edge
of
life
they
took
what
came
grateful
for
little
pleasures
glad
even
to
talk
their
own
tongue
and
then
one
broiling
august
day
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
compound
was
usually
seething
with
the
first
fetid
life
of
the
day
rudolph
found
it
suddenly
silent
when
he
entered
it
and
hostile
contemptuous
eyes
on
him
a
girl
with
anna
klein
eyes
a
girl
he
had
begun
to
fancy
suddenly
said
there
was
a
ripple
of
laughter
around
the
compound
they
commenced
to
bait
him
those
women
he
would
not
have
wiped
his
feet
on
at
home
they
literally
laughed
him
out
of
the
compound
he
went
home
to
his
stifling
windowless
adobe
room
with
its
sagging
narrow
bed
its
candle
its
broken
crockery
and
he
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
and
chewed
his
nails
with
fury
after
a
time
he
sat
down
and
considered
what
to
do
next
he
would
have
to
move
on
some
time
as
well
now
as
ever
he
was
sick
of
the
place
he
began
preparations
to
move
on
gathering
up
the
accumulation
of
months
of
careless
living
for
destruction
he
picked
up
some
newspapers
preparatory
to
throwing
them
away
and
a
name
caught
his
attention
standing
there
inside
his
doorway
in
the
mexican
dusk
he
read
of
graham
recent
wounding
his
mending
and
the
fact
that
he
had
won
the
croix
de
guerre
supreme
bitterness
was
rudolph
then
stage
stuff
he
muttered
but
in
the
depths
of
his
warped
soul
there
was
bitter
envy
he
knew
well
with
what
frightened
yet
adoring
eyes
anna
klein
had
devoured
that
news
of
graham
spencer
while
for
him
there
was
the
girl
in
the
compound
back
of
the
owl
with
anna
klein
eyes
filled
when
she
looked
at
him
with
that
bitterest
scorn
of
all
the
contempt
of
the
wholly
contemptible
that
night
he
went
to
the
owl
he
had
shaved
and
had
his
hair
cut
and
he
wore
his
only
remaining
decent
suit
of
clothes
he
passed
through
the
swinging
gate
in
the
railing
which
separated
the
from
the
tables
and
went
up
to
the
line
of
girls
sitting
in
that
saddest
waiting
of
all
the
world
along
the
wall
there
was
an
ominous
silence
at
his
approach
he
planted
himself
in
front
of
the
girl
with
eyes
like
anna
klein
are
you
going
to
dance
not
with
you
she
replied
evenly
and
again
the
ripple
of
laughter
spread
why
not
because
you
a
coward
she
said
i
rather
dance
with
a
if
you
think
i
here
because
i
afraid
to
fight
you
can
think
again
not
that
i
care
what
you
he
had
meant
to
boast
a
little
to
intimate
that
he
had
pulled
off
a
big
thing
but
he
saw
that
he
was
ridiculous
the
situation
infuriated
him
suddenly
he
burst
into
invective
until
one
of
the
girls
said
wearily
oh
cut
that
out
you
and
he
knew
that
no
single
word
he
had
used
against
them
out
of
a
vocabulary
both
extensive
and
horrible
was
to
them
so
degraded
as
that
single
one
applied
to
him
late
that
night
he
received
a
tip
from
a
dealer
at
one
of
tables
there
were
inquiries
being
made
for
him
across
the
border
that
very
evening
he
the
dealer
had
gone
across
for
a
sack
of
flour
and
he
had
heard
about
it
you
better
get
out
said
the
dealer
i
as
safe
here
as
i
be
in
mexico
do
be
too
sure
son
you
not
any
too
popular
here
there
such
a
thing
as
being
held
up
and
carried
over
the
border
it
been
done
before
i
sick
of
this
hole
anyhow
rudolph
muttered
and
moved
away
in
the
crowd
the
mechanical
piano
was
banging
in
the
as
he
slipped
out
into
the
darkness
under
the
clear
starlight
of
the
mexican
night
and
the
gate
of
the
compound
stood
open
he
passed
it
with
an
oath
long
before
he
had
provided
for
such
a
contingency
by
the
same
agency
which
had
got
him
to
the
border
he
could
now
be
sent
further
on
at
something
after
midnight
clad
in
old
clothes
and
carrying
on
his
back
a
rough
outfit
of
a
blanket
and
his
remaining
wardrobe
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
a
small
adobe
house
on
the
border
of
the
town
an
elderly
german
with
a
candle
admitted
him
well
i
off
rudolph
said
roughly
and
time
enough
too
said
the
german
gruffly
rudolph
was
sullenly
silent
he
was
in
this
man
power
and
he
knew
it
but
the
german
was
ready
enough
to
do
his
part
for
months
he
had
been
doing
this
very
thing
starting
through
the
desert
toward
the
south
slackers
and
fugitives
of
all
descriptions
he
gathered
together
the
equipment
a
map
with
marked
a
canteen
covered
with
a
dirty
casing
a
small
supply
of
condensed
foods
in
tins
mostly
and
a
letter
to
certain
germans
in
mexico
city
who
would
receive
hospitably
any
american
fugitives
and
ask
no
questions
how
about
money
rudolph
inquired
the
german
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
will
not
need
money
in
the
desert
he
said
and
you
haf
spent
much
money
here
on
the
women
you
should
have
safed
i
was
told
you
would
give
me
but
the
german
shook
his
head
you
viii
find
money
in
mexico
city
if
you
get
there
he
said
cryptically
and
rudolph
found
neither
threats
nor
entreaties
of
any
avail
he
started
out
of
the
town
turning
toward
the
south
and
west
before
him
there
stretched
days
of
lonely
traveling
through
the
sand
and
cactus
of
the
desert
of
blistering
sun
and
cold
nights
of
anxious
searches
for
it
was
because
of
the
that
he
headed
southwest
for
such
as
they
were
they
lay
in
tiny
hidden
oases
in
the
canyons
almost
as
soon
as
he
left
the
town
he
was
in
the
desert
a
detached
ranch
a
suggestion
of
a
road
a
or
two
an
irrigation
ditch
and
then
sand
he
was
soft
from
months
of
inaction
from
the
cactus
whisky
of
mexico
too
that
ate
into
a
man
like
a
corrosive
acid
but
he
went
on
steadily
putting
behind
him
as
rapidly
as
possible
the
border
and
the
girls
who
had
laughed
at
him
he
traveled
by
a
pointed
mountain
which
cut
off
the
stars
at
the
horizon
and
as
the
miles
behind
him
increased
in
spite
of
his
growing
fatigue
his
spirits
rose
before
him
lay
the
fulness
of
life
again
mexico
city
was
a
stake
worth
gambling
for
he
was
gambling
he
knew
he
had
put
up
his
life
and
his
opponent
was
thirst
he
knew
that
well
enough
too
and
the
figure
rather
amused
him
playing
against
that
all
right
he
muttered
he
paused
and
turned
around
the
sun
had
lifted
over
the
rim
of
the
desert
a
red
disc
which
turned
the
gleaming
white
alkali
patches
to
rose
by
god
he
said
that
the
ante
is
it
a
red
chip
a
caravan
of
mules
was
coming
up
from
the
head
of
the
gulf
of
california
it
moved
in
a
cloud
of
alkali
dust
and
sand
its
coated
white
the
animals
straggled
along
wandering
out
of
the
line
incessantly
and
thrust
back
into
place
by
muleteers
who
cracked
long
whips
and
addressed
them
vilely
at
a
place
where
a
small
rock
placed
on
another
marked
a
side
trail
to
water
the
caravan
turned
and
moved
toward
the
mountains
close
as
they
appeared
the
outfit
was
three
hours
getting
to
the
foot
hills
there
was
a
low
meadow
now
covered
with
pale
green
grass
quail
scurried
away
under
the
mesquite
bushes
stealthily
whistling
and
here
and
there
the
two
stones
still
marked
the
way
with
the
instinct
of
desert
creatures
the
mules
hurried
their
pace
creaked
spurs
jingled
life
insistent
thirsty
life
quickened
the
dead
plain
a
man
rode
ahead
he
dug
his
spurs
into
his
horse
and
cantered
elbows
flapping
hat
drawn
over
his
eyes
for
hours
he
had
been
fighting
the
demon
of
thirst
his
tongue
was
dry
his
lips
cracking
the
trail
continued
to
be
marked
with
its
double
stones
but
it
did
not
enter
the
cool
canyon
ahead
it
turned
and
skirted
the
base
of
the
bare
mountain
slope
the
man
eyes
sharpened
he
knew
very
definitely
what
he
was
looking
for
and
at
last
he
saw
it
a
circle
of
flat
stones
some
twenty
feet
across
the
desert
sign
for
a
buried
spring
but
there
was
something
inside
the
circle
something
which
lay
still
the
man
put
his
horse
to
the
gallop
again
there
was
a
canteen
lying
in
the
trail
a
canteen
covered
with
a
dirty
plaid
casing
the
horse
hoof
struck
it
and
it
gave
out
a
dry
metallic
sound
poor
devil
muttered
the
rider
he
dismounted
and
turned
the
figure
over
god
he
said
and
water
under
him
all
the
time
then
he
dragged
the
quiet
figure
outside
the
ring
of
stones
and
getting
a
spade
from
his
saddle
fell
to
digging
in
the
center
a
foot
below
the
surface
water
began
to
appear
clear
cold
water
he
lay
down
flat
and
drank
out
of
the
pool
clayton
spencer
was
alone
in
his
house
in
the
months
since
natalie
had
gone
he
had
not
been
there
a
great
deal
he
had
been
working
very
hard
he
had
not
been
able
to
shoulder
arms
but
he
had
nevertheless
fought
a
good
fight
he
was
very
tired
during
the
day
a
sort
of
fierce
energy
upheld
him
because
in
certain
things
he
had
failed
he
was
the
more
determined
to
succeed
in
others
not
for
himself
ambition
of
that
sort
had
died
of
the
higher
desire
to
serve
his
country
but
because
the
sense
of
failure
in
his
private
life
haunted
him
the
house
was
very
quiet
buckham
came
in
to
mend
the
fire
issuing
from
the
shadows
like
a
lean
old
ghost
and
eyeing
him
with
tender
faded
old
eyes
is
there
anything
else
sir
thanks
no
yes
i
have
not
spoken
about
it
but
i
think
you
have
understood
spencer
is
not
coming
yes
i
had
meant
to
close
the
house
but
certain
things
captain
wife
expects
a
child
i
would
rather
like
to
have
her
come
here
for
the
birth
after
that
if
the
war
is
over
i
shall
turn
the
house
over
to
them
you
would
stay
on
i
hope
i
stay
sir
i
his
face
worked
nervously
i
feel
toward
the
captain
as
i
would
to
my
own
son
sir
i
have
already
thought
that
perhaps
the
old
nursery
has
been
cleaned
and
aired
for
weeks
clayton
felt
a
thrill
of
understanding
for
the
old
man
through
all
the
years
he
had
watched
and
served
them
he
had
reflected
their
joys
and
their
sorrows
he
had
suffered
the
family
destiny
without
having
shaped
it
he
had
lived
vicariously
their
good
hours
and
their
bad
and
now
in
his
old
age
he
was
waiting
again
for
the
vicarious
joy
of
child
but
you
not
be
leaving
the
house
sir
i
do
know
i
shall
keep
my
rooms
but
i
shall
probably
live
at
the
club
the
young
people
ought
to
be
alone
for
a
while
there
are
readjustments
you
never
married
buckham
no
spencer
i
intended
to
at
one
time
i
came
to
this
country
to
make
a
home
and
as
i
was
rather
a
long
time
about
it
she
married
some
one
clayton
caught
the
echo
of
an
old
pain
in
buckham
repressed
voice
buckham
too
was
there
in
the
life
of
every
man
some
woman
tragedy
buckham
sitting
alone
in
his
west
window
and
looking
toward
the
sunset
buckham
had
his
memories
she
lost
her
only
son
at
neuve
chapelle
buckham
was
saying
quietly
in
a
way
it
was
as
tho
i
had
lost
a
boy
she
never
cared
for
the
man
she
married
he
was
a
fine
boy
sir
i
you
may
remember
the
night
i
was
taken
ill
in
the
is
her
husband
still
living
no
do
you
ever
think
of
going
back
and
finding
her
i
have
sir
but
i
do
know
i
like
to
remember
her
as
she
used
to
be
i
have
some
beautiful
memories
and
i
think
sometimes
it
is
better
to
live
on
memories
they
are
more
real
than
well
than
reality
long
after
buckham
had
withdrawn
clayton
paced
the
floor
of
the
library
was
buckham
right
was
the
real
life
of
a
man
his
mental
life
was
any
love
so
great
as
a
man
dream
of
love
peace
was
on
the
way
soon
this
nightmare
of
war
would
be
over
and
in
the
great
awakening
love
would
again
take
the
place
of
hate
love
of
man
for
man
of
nation
for
nation
peace
and
the
things
of
peace
time
to
live
time
to
hope
with
the
gone
time
to
work
and
time
to
play
time
to
love
a
woman
and
cherish
her
for
the
rest
of
life
if
only
his
failure
with
natalie
had
lost
him
something
she
had
cost
him
his
belief
in
himself
her
last
words
had
crystallized
his
own
sense
of
failure
i
admit
all
your
good
qualities
clay
heaven
knows
they
are
evident
enough
but
you
are
the
sort
people
admire
they
do
love
you
they
never
yet
that
night
he
had
had
a
curious
sense
that
old
buckham
loved
him
maybe
he
was
the
sort
men
loved
and
women
admired
he
sat
down
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
watching
the
he
felt
very
tired
what
was
that
buckham
had
said
about
memories
but
buckham
was
old
he
was
young
young
and
strong
there
would
be
many
years
and
even
his
most
poignant
memories
would
grow
dim
audrey
audrey
from
the
wall
over
the
mantel
natalie
portrait
still
surveyed
the
room
with
its
delicate
complacence
he
looked
up
at
it
yes
natalie
had
been
right
he
was
not
the
sort
to
make
a
woman
happy
there
were
plenty
of
men
young
men
men
still
plastic
men
who
had
not
known
shipwreck
and
some
such
man
audrey
would
marry
perhaps
already
in
france
he
got
up
his
desk
was
covered
with
papers
neatly
endorsed
by
his
secretary
he
turned
out
all
the
lights
but
his
desk
lamp
gleaming
died
into
the
shadows
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
up
at
it
a
dead
thing
remote
flat
without
significance
then
he
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
took
up
a
bundle
of
government
papers
there
was
still
work
thank
god
for
work
chapter
l
audrey
was
in
paris
on
the
eleventh
of
november
now
and
then
she
got
back
there
and
reveled
for
a
day
or
two
in
the
mere
joy
of
paved
streets
and
great
orderly
buildings
she
liked
the
streets
and
the
crowds
she
liked
watching
the
american
boys
swaggering
along
smoking
innumerable
cigarets
and
surveying
the
city
with
interested
patronizing
eyes
and
always
walking
briskly
along
the
rue
royale
or
the
avenue
de
or
in
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
where
the
played
their
odd
french
games
her
eyes
were
searching
the
faces
of
the
men
she
met
any
tall
man
in
civilian
clothes
set
her
heart
beating
faster
she
was
quite
honest
with
herself
she
knew
that
she
was
watching
for
clay
and
she
had
a
magnificent
shamelessness
in
her
quest
and
now
at
last
the
daily
mail
had
announced
his
arrival
in
france
and
at
first
every
ring
of
her
telephone
had
sent
her
to
it
somewhat
breathless
but
quite
confident
he
would
she
considered
call
up
the
red
cross
at
the
hotel
regina
and
they
would
by
her
instructions
give
her
hotel
then
on
that
monday
morning
which
was
the
eleventh
she
realized
that
he
would
not
call
her
up
she
knew
it
suddenly
and
absolutely
she
sat
down
when
the
knowledge
came
to
her
with
a
sickening
feeling
that
if
he
did
not
come
to
her
now
he
never
would
come
yet
even
then
she
did
not
doubt
that
he
cared
cared
as
desperately
as
she
did
the
bond
still
held
she
tried
very
hard
sitting
there
by
her
wood
fire
in
the
orderly
uniform
which
made
her
so
quaintly
young
and
boyish
to
understand
the
twisted
mental
processes
that
kept
him
away
from
her
now
that
he
was
free
and
in
the
end
she
came
rather
close
to
the
truth
his
sense
of
failure
his
loss
of
confidence
in
himself
where
his
love
life
was
concerned
the
strange
twisting
and
warping
that
were
natalie
sole
legacy
from
their
years
together
for
months
she
had
been
tending
broken
bodies
and
broken
spirits
but
the
broken
pride
of
a
man
was
a
strange
and
terrible
thing
she
did
not
know
where
he
was
stopping
and
in
the
congestion
of
the
paris
hotels
it
would
be
practically
impossible
to
trace
him
and
there
too
her
own
pride
stepped
in
he
must
come
to
her
he
knew
she
cared
she
had
been
honest
with
him
always
with
a
sort
of
terrible
honesty
surveying
the
past
months
she
wondered
not
for
the
first
time
what
had
held
them
apart
so
long
against
the
urge
that
had
become
the
strongest
thing
in
life
to
them
both
the
strength
in
her
had
come
from
him
she
knew
that
but
where
had
clay
got
his
strength
men
were
not
like
that
often
failing
final
happiness
they
so
often
took
what
they
could
get
like
chris
perhaps
for
the
first
and
last
time
she
saw
clayton
spencer
that
morning
with
her
mind
as
well
as
with
her
heart
she
saw
him
big
and
generous
and
fine
but
she
saw
him
also
not
quite
so
big
as
his
love
conventional
bound
by
tradition
and
early
training
somewhat
rigid
calvinistic
and
dominated
still
by
a
fierce
sex
pride
at
once
the
weaknesses
of
the
middle
span
and
its
safety
and
she
loved
him
for
both
his
weakness
and
his
strength
a
bigger
man
might
have
taken
her
a
smaller
man
would
have
let
her
go
clay
was
just
clay
intelligent
but
not
shrewd
blundering
honest
clay
she
was
one
great
ache
for
the
shelter
of
his
arms
she
had
a
small
sense
of
shame
that
on
that
day
of
all
others
she
should
be
obsessed
with
her
own
affairs
this
was
a
great
day
that
morning
if
all
went
well
the
war
was
to
cease
the
curtain
was
to
fall
on
the
great
melodrama
and
those
who
had
watched
it
and
those
who
had
played
in
it
would
with
the
drop
of
the
curtain
turn
away
from
the
illusion
that
is
war
to
the
small
and
quiet
things
of
home
home
she
repeated
she
had
no
home
but
it
was
a
great
day
nevertheless
only
that
morning
the
femme
de
chambre
had
said
with
exaltation
in
her
great
eyes
so
it
is
finished
madame
or
soon
it
will
be
in
an
hour
or
it
will
be
finished
and
madame
will
go
back
to
the
life
she
lived
her
eyes
had
turned
to
where
on
the
lay
the
gold
fittings
of
audrey
she
visualized
audrey
back
in
rich
opulent
america
surrounded
by
the
luxury
the
gold
trinkets
would
indicate
madame
must
be
lovely
in
the
costume
for
a
ball
she
said
and
sighed
for
her
a
farm
in
brittany
the
endless
round
of
small
duties
for
the
american
sitting
there
alone
audrey
felt
already
the
reactions
of
peace
the
war
had
torn
up
such
roots
as
had
held
her
she
was
terribly
aware
too
that
she
had
outgrown
her
old
environment
the
old
days
were
gone
the
old
audrey
was
gone
and
in
her
place
was
a
quiet
woman
whose
hands
had
known
service
and
would
never
again
be
content
to
be
idle
yet
she
knew
that
with
the
war
the
world
call
would
be
gone
not
again
for
her
detached
impersonal
service
she
was
not
of
the
great
of
the
earth
what
she
wanted
quite
simply
was
the
service
of
love
to
have
her
own
and
to
care
for
them
she
hoped
very
earnestly
that
she
would
be
able
to
look
beyond
her
own
four
walls
to
see
distress
and
to
help
it
but
she
knew
as
she
knew
herself
that
the
real
call
to
her
would
always
be
love
she
felt
a
certain
impatience
at
herself
this
was
to
be
the
greatest
day
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
while
all
the
earth
waited
for
the
signal
guns
she
waited
for
a
man
who
had
apparently
determined
not
to
take
her
back
into
his
life
she
went
out
onto
her
small
stone
balcony
on
the
rue
danou
and
looked
out
to
where
on
the
rue
de
la
paix
the
city
traffic
moved
with
a
sort
of
sporadic
expectancy
men
stopped
and
consulted
their
watches
a
few
stood
along
the
curb
and
talked
in
low
voices
groups
of
men
in
khaki
walked
by
or
stopped
to
glance
into
the
shop
windows
they
too
were
waiting
she
could
see
far
below
her
valet
de
chambre
in
his
green
felt
apron
and
the
concierge
in
his
blue
frock
coat
and
brass
buttons
unbending
in
the
new
democracy
of
hope
to
talk
to
a
cabman
suddenly
audrey
felt
the
same
exaltation
that
had
been
in
eyes
those
boys
below
in
uniform
they
were
not
tragic
now
they
were
the
hope
of
the
world
not
its
sacrifice
they
were
going
to
live
they
were
going
to
live
she
went
into
her
bedroom
and
put
on
her
service
hat
and
as
she
opened
the
door
suzanne
was
standing
outside
one
hand
upraised
into
the
quiet
hallway
there
came
the
distant
sound
of
the
signal
guns
cried
suzanne
and
suddenly
broke
into
wild
hysterical
sobbing
all
the
way
audrey
was
praying
not
articulately
but
in
her
heart
that
this
was
indeed
the
end
that
the
grapes
of
wrath
had
all
been
trampled
that
the
nations
of
the
world
might
again
look
forward
instead
of
back
and
because
she
was
not
of
the
great
of
the
earth
but
only
a
loving
woman
that
somewhere
clay
was
hearing
the
guns
as
she
was
and
would
find
hope
in
them
and
a
future
when
a
great
burden
is
lifted
the
relief
is
not
always
felt
at
once
the
galled
places
still
ache
the
sense
of
weight
persists
and
so
with
paris
not
at
once
did
the
city
rejoice
openly
it
prayed
first
and
then
it
counted
the
sore
spots
and
they
were
many
and
it
was
dazed
too
there
had
been
no
time
to
discount
peace
in
advance
the
streets
filled
at
once
but
at
first
it
was
with
a
chastened
people
audrey
herself
felt
numb
and
unreal
she
moved
mechanically
with
the
shifting
crowd
looking
overhead
as
a
captured
german
plane
flew
by
trying
to
comprehend
the
incomprehensible
but
by
the
sober
note
of
the
crowds
had
risen
to
a
higher
pitch
a
file
of
american
doughboys
led
by
a
corporal
with
a
tin
trumpet
and
officered
by
a
sergeant
with
an
enormous
american
cigar
down
the
avenue
de
gaining
recruits
at
every
step
it
madly
through
the
crowd
singing
that
one
lyric
of
young
america
hail
hail
the
gang
all
here
but
the
gang
was
not
all
there
and
they
knew
it
some
of
them
lay
in
the
argonne
or
at
and
for
them
peace
had
come
too
late
but
the
americans
like
the
rest
of
the
world
had
put
the
past
behind
them
here
was
the
present
the
glorious
present
and
paris
on
a
sunny
monday
and
after
that
would
be
home
hail
hail
the
gang
all
here
what
the
hell
do
we
care
what
the
hell
do
we
care
hail
hail
the
gang
all
here
what
the
hell
do
we
care
now
gradually
the
noise
became
uproarious
there
were
no
bands
in
paris
and
any
with
a
tin
horn
or
a
toy
drum
could
start
a
procession
bearded
little
poilus
arm
in
arm
from
curb
to
curb
marched
grinning
down
the
center
of
the
streets
capturing
and
kissing
pretty
midinettes
or
surrounding
officers
and
dancing
madly
audrey
saw
an
algerian
ragged
and
dirty
from
the
kiss
on
both
cheeks
a
portly
british
admiral
of
the
fleet
and
was
herself
kissed
by
a
french
sailor
with
extreme
robustness
and
a
slight
tinge
of
vin
ordinaire
she
went
on
smiling
if
only
clay
were
seeing
all
this
he
had
worked
so
hard
he
had
a
right
to
this
wonderful
hour
at
least
if
he
had
gone
to
the
front
to
see
graham
but
then
it
must
be
rather
wonderful
at
the
front
too
she
tried
to
visualize
it
the
guns
quiet
and
the
strained
look
gone
from
the
faces
of
the
men
with
the
wonderful
feeling
that
as
there
was
now
there
would
also
be
she
felt
a
curious
shrinking
from
the
people
she
knew
for
this
one
day
she
wanted
to
be
alone
this
peace
was
a
thing
of
the
soul
and
of
the
soul
alone
she
knew
what
it
would
be
with
the
people
she
knew
best
in
paris
hastily
arranged
riotous
parties
a
great
deal
of
champagne
and
noise
and
overlying
the
real
sentiment
much
sentimentality
she
realized
with
a
faint
smile
that
the
old
audrey
would
have
welcomed
that
very
gayety
she
was
even
rather
resentful
with
herself
for
her
own
aloofness
she
quite
forgot
luncheon
and
early
afternoon
found
her
on
the
balcony
of
the
crillon
hotel
overlooking
the
place
de
la
concorde
paris
was
truly
awake
by
that
time
and
going
mad
the
fountains
were
playing
poilus
and
american
soldiers
had
seized
captured
german
cannon
and
were
hauling
them
wildly
about
if
in
the
morning
the
crowd
had
been
largely
khaki
now
the
french
blue
predominated
flags
and
confetti
were
everywhere
and
every
motor
as
it
pushed
slowly
through
the
crowd
carried
on
roof
and
running
board
and
engine
hood
crowds
of
passengers
a
british
band
was
playing
near
the
fountain
a
line
of
helmets
above
the
mass
and
wild
cheers
revealed
french
cavalry
riding
through
and
heralded
by
jeers
and
much
applause
came
a
procession
of
the
proletariat
of
odds
and
ends
soldiers
and
mechanics
and
and
cabmen
and
students
carrying
an
effigy
of
the
kaiser
on
a
gibbet
as
the
sun
went
down
the
outlines
of
the
rejoicing
city
took
on
the
faint
of
a
dream
city
it
softened
the
outlines
of
the
eiffel
tower
to
strange
and
beauty
and
gave
to
the
trees
in
the
tuileries
gardens
the
lack
of
definition
of
an
old
engraving
and
as
if
to
remind
the
rejoicing
of
the
price
of
their
happiness
there
came
limping
through
the
crowd
a
procession
of
the
mutilees
they
stumped
along
on
wooden
legs
or
on
crutches
they
rode
in
wheeled
chairs
they
were
led
who
could
not
see
and
they
smiled
and
cheered
none
of
them
was
whole
but
every
one
was
a
full
man
for
all
that
audrey
cried
shamelessly
like
suzanne
but
quietly
and
not
for
the
first
time
that
day
she
thought
of
chris
she
had
never
loved
him
but
it
was
pitiful
that
he
could
not
have
lived
he
had
so
loved
life
he
would
have
so
relished
all
this
the
pageantry
of
it
and
the
gayety
and
the
night
revelry
that
was
to
follow
poor
chris
he
had
thrown
everything
away
even
life
the
world
perhaps
was
better
that
these
mutilees
below
had
given
what
they
had
but
chris
had
gone
like
a
pebble
thrown
into
a
lake
he
had
made
his
tiny
ripple
and
had
vanished
then
she
remembered
that
she
was
not
quite
fair
perhaps
she
had
never
been
fair
to
chris
he
had
given
all
he
had
he
had
not
lived
well
but
he
had
died
well
and
there
was
something
to
be
said
for
death
for
the
first
time
in
her
healthy
life
she
wondered
about
death
standing
here
on
the
crillon
balcony
with
the
city
gone
mad
with
life
below
her
death
was
quiet
it
might
be
rather
wonderful
she
thought
if
clay
did
not
want
her
that
perhaps
it
would
be
very
comforting
just
to
die
and
forget
about
everything
from
beneath
the
balcony
there
came
again
lustily
the
shouts
of
a
dozen
doughboys
hauling
a
german
gun
hail
hail
the
gang
all
here
what
the
hell
do
we
care
what
the
hell
do
we
care
hail
hail
the
gang
all
here
what
the
hell
do
we
care
now
then
that
night
clay
came
the
roistering
city
outside
had
made
of
her
little
a
sort
of
sanctuary
into
which
came
only
faintly
the
blasts
of
horns
hoarse
strains
of
the
marseillaise
sung
by
an
people
the
shuffling
of
myriad
feet
the
occasional
screams
of
women
mr
spencer
is
calling
said
the
concierge
over
the
telephone
in
his
slow
english
and
suddenly
a
tight
band
snapped
which
had
seemed
to
bind
audrey
head
all
day
she
was
calm
she
was
herself
again
life
was
very
wonderful
peace
was
very
wonderful
the
dear
old
world
the
good
old
world
the
kind
loving
tender
old
world
which
separated
people
that
they
might
know
the
joy
of
coming
together
again
she
wanted
to
sing
she
wanted
to
hang
over
her
balcony
and
teach
the
french
the
yet
when
she
had
opened
the
door
she
could
not
even
speak
and
clay
too
after
one
long
look
at
her
only
held
out
his
arms
it
was
rather
a
long
time
indeed
before
they
found
any
words
at
all
audrey
was
the
first
and
what
she
said
astounded
her
for
she
said
what
a
dreadful
noise
and
clay
responded
with
equal
gravity
yes
is
it
then
he
took
off
his
overcoat
and
put
it
down
and
placed
his
hat
on
the
table
and
said
very
simply
i
could
stay
away
i
tried
you
had
a
chance
in
the
world
clay
when
i
was
willing
you
to
then
there
was
one
of
those
silences
which
come
when
words
have
shown
their
absolute
absurdity
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
he
broke
it
i
not
young
audrey
and
i
have
failed
it
takes
two
to
make
a
failure
she
said
dauntlessly
i
would
let
you
fail
again
clay
not
if
you
love
if
i
love
you
then
he
was
somehow
in
that
grotesque
position
that
is
only
absurd
to
the
on
his
knees
beside
her
his
terrible
was
gone
he
only
knew
that
somehow
some
way
he
must
prove
to
her
his
humility
his
love
his
terrible
fear
of
losing
her
again
his
hope
that
together
they
might
make
up
for
the
wasted
years
of
their
lives
i
worship
you
he
said
the
little
room
was
a
sanctuary
the
war
lay
behind
them
wasted
and
troubled
years
lay
behind
them
youth
first
youth
was
gone
with
its
illusions
and
its
dreams
but
before
them
lay
the
years
of
fulfilment
years
of
understanding
youth
demanded
everything
and
was
discontented
that
it
secured
less
than
its
demands
now
they
asked
but
three
things
work
and
peace
and
love
and
the
greatest
of
these
was
love
something
like
that
he
said
to
her
when
the
first
inarticulateness
had
passed
and
when
as
is
the
way
of
a
man
with
the
woman
who
loves
him
he
tried
to
lay
his
soul
as
well
as
his
heart
at
her
feet
the
knowledge
that
the
years
brought
that
love
in
youth
was
a
plant
of
easy
growth
springing
up
in
many
soils
but
that
the
love
of
the
middle
span
of
a
man
life
whether
that
love
be
the
early
love
purified
by
fire
or
a
new
love
sowed
in
sacrifice
and
watered
with
tears
the
love
that
was
to
carry
a
man
and
a
woman
through
to
the
end
the
last
love
was
infinitely
precious
gift
a
gift
to
take
the
place
of
the
things
that
had
gone
with
youth
of
high
adventure
and
the
lilt
of
the
singing
heart
the
last
gift
