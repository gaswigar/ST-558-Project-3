extensive

did
not
uncover
any

that
the
copyright
on
this

was
renewed
o
sleeper
awake
the
long
tapers
flickered
sending
the
black
shadows
wavering
along
the
walls
and
the
velvet
tapestries
rippled
yet
there
was
no
wind
in
the
chamber
four
men
stood
about
the
ebony
table
on
which
lay
the
green
sarcophagus
that
gleamed
like
carven
jade
in
the
upraised
right
hand
of
each
man
a
curious
black
candle
burned
with
a
weird
greenish
light
outside
was
night
and
a
lost
wind
moaning
among
the
black
trees
inside
the
chamber
was
tense
silence
and
the
wavering
of
the
shadows
while
four
pairs
of
eyes
burning
with
intensity
were
fixed
on
the
long
green
case
across
which
cryptic
hieroglyphics
writhed
as
if
lent
life
and
movement
by
the
unsteady
light
the
man
at
the
foot
of
the
sarcophagus
leaned
over
it
and
moved
his
candle
as
if
he
were
writing
with
a
pen
inscribing
a
mystic
symbol
in
the
air
then
he
set
down
the
candle
in
its
black
gold
stick
at
the
foot
of
the
case
and
mumbling
some
formula
unintelligible
to
his
companions
he
thrust
a
broad
white
hand
into
his
robe
when
he
brought
it
forth
again
it
was
as
if
he
cupped
in
his
palm
a
ball
of
living
fire
the
other
three
drew
in
their
breath
sharply
and
the
dark
powerful
man
who
stood
at
the
head
of
the
sarcophagus
whispered
heart
of
ahriman
the
other
lifted
a
quick
hand
for
silence
somewhere
a
dog
began
howling
dolefully
and
a
stealthy
step
padded
outside
the
barred
and
bolted
door
but
none
looked
aside
from
the
over
which
the
man
in
the
robe
was
now
moving
the
great
flaming
jewel
while
he
muttered
an
incantation
that
was
old
when
atlantis
sank
the
glare
of
the
gem
dazzled
their
eyes
so
that
they
could
not
be
sure
of
what
they
saw
but
with
a
splintering
crash
the
carven
lid
of
the
sarcophagus
burst
outward
as
if
from
some
irresistible
pressure
applied
from
within
and
the
four
men
bending
eagerly
forward
saw
the
occupant
a
huddled
withered
wizened
shape
with
dried
brown
limbs
like
dead
wood
showing
through
moldering
bandages
that
thing
muttered
the
small
dark
man
who
stood
on
the
right
with
a
short
sardonic
laugh
is
ready
to
crumble
at
a
touch
we
are
fools
it
was
an
urgent
hiss
of
command
from
the
large
man
who
held
the
jewel
perspiration
stood
upon
his
broad
white
forehead
and
his
eyes
were
dilated
he
leaned
forward
and
without
touching
the
thing
with
his
hand
laid
on
the
breast
of
the
mummy
the
blazing
jewel
then
he
drew
back
and
watched
with
fierce
intensity
his
lips
moving
in
soundless
invocation
it
was
as
if
a
globe
of
living
fire
flickered
and
burned
on
the
dead
withered
bosom
and
breath
sucked
in
hissing
through
the
clenched
teeth
of
the
watchers
for
as
they
watched
an
awful
transmutation
became
apparent
the
withered
shape
in
the
sarcophagus
was
expanding
was
growing
lengthening
the
bandages
burst
and
fell
into
brown
dust
the
shriveled
limbs
swelled
straightened
their
dusky
hue
began
to
fade
mitra
whispered
the
tall
man
on
the
left
was
a
stygian
that
part
at
least
was
true
again
a
trembling
finger
warned
for
silence
the
hound
outside
was
no
longer
howling
he
whimpered
as
with
an
evil
dream
and
then
that
sound
too
died
away
in
silence
in
which
the
man
plainly
heard
the
straining
of
the
heavy
door
as
if
something
outside
pushed
powerfully
upon
it
he
half
turned
his
hand
at
his
sword
but
the
man
in
the
ermine
robe
hissed
an
urgent
warning
do
not
break
the
chain
and
on
your
life
do
not
go
to
the
door
the
man
shrugged
and
turned
back
and
then
he
stopped
short
staring
in
the
jade
sarcophagus
lay
a
living
man
a
tall
lusty
man
naked
white
of
skin
and
dark
of
hair
and
beard
he
lay
motionless
his
eyes
wide
open
and
blank
and
unknowing
as
a
newborn
babe
on
his
breast
the
great
jewel
smoldered
and
sparkled
the
man
in
ermine
reeled
as
if
from
some
of
extreme
tension
he
gasped
is
xaltotun
he
lives
valerius
tarascus
amalric
do
you
see
do
you
see
you
doubted
me
but
i
have
not
failed
we
have
been
close
to
the
open
gates
of
hell
this
night
and
the
shapes
of
darkness
have
gathered
close
about
us
aye
they
followed
to
the
very
door
but
we
have
brought
the
great
magician
back
to
life
damned
our
souls
to
purgatories
everlasting
i
doubt
not
muttered
the
small
dark
man
tarascus
the
man
valerius
laughed
harshly
purgatory
can
be
worse
than
life
itself
so
we
are
all
damned
together
from
birth
besides
who
would
not
sell
his
miserable
soul
for
a
throne
is
no
intelligence
in
his
stare
orastes
said
the
large
man
has
long
been
dead
answered
orastes
is
as
one
newly
awakened
his
mind
is
empty
after
the
long
sleep
nay
he
was
not
sleeping
we
brought
his
spirit
back
over
the
voids
and
gulfs
of
night
and
oblivion
i
will
speak
to
him
he
bent
over
the
foot
of
the
sarcophagus
and
fixing
his
gaze
on
the
wide
dark
eyes
of
the
man
within
he
said
slowly
xaltotun
the
lips
of
the
man
moved
mechanically
he
repeated
in
a
groping
whisper
are
xaltotun
exclaimed
orastes
like
a
hypnotist
driving
home
his
suggestions
are
xaltotun
of
python
in
acheron
a
dim
flame
flickered
in
the
dark
eyes
was
xaltotun
he
whispered
am
dead
xaltotun
cried
orastes
are
not
dead
you
live
am
xaltotun
came
the
eery
whisper
i
am
dead
in
my
house
in
khemi
in
stygia
there
i
died
the
priests
who
poisoned
you
mummified
your
body
with
their
dark
arts
keeping
all
your
organs
intact
exclaimed
orastes
now
you
live
again
the
heart
of
ahriman
has
restored
your
life
drawn
your
spirit
back
from
space
and
eternity
heart
of
ahriman
the
flame
of
remembrance
grew
stronger
barbarians
stole
it
from
me
remembers
muttered
orastes
him
from
the
case
the
others
obeyed
hesitantly
as
if
reluctant
to
touch
the
man
they
had
recreated
and
they
seemed
not
easier
in
their
minds
when
they
felt
firm
muscular
flesh
vibrant
with
blood
and
life
beneath
their
fingers
but
they
lifted
him
upon
the
table
and
orastes
clothed
him
in
a
curious
dark
velvet
robe
splashed
with
gold
stars
and
crescent
moons
and
fastened
a
fillet
about
his
temples
confining
the
black
wavy
locks
that
fell
to
his
shoulders
he
let
them
do
as
they
would
saying
nothing
not
even
when
they
set
him
in
a
carven
chair
with
a
high
ebony
back
and
wide
silver
arms
and
feet
like
golden
claws
he
sat
there
motionless
and
slowly
intelligence
grew
in
his
dark
eyes
and
made
them
deep
and
strange
and
luminous
it
was
as
if
witchlights
floated
slowly
up
through
midnight
pools
of
darkness
orastes
cast
a
furtive
glance
at
his
companions
who
stood
staring
in
morbid
fascination
at
their
strange
guest
their
iron
nerves
had
withstood
an
ordeal
that
might
have
driven
weaker
men
mad
he
knew
it
was
with
no
weaklings
that
he
conspired
but
men
whose
courage
was
as
profound
as
their
lawless
ambitions
and
capacity
for
evil
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
figure
in
the
chair
and
this
one
spoke
at
last
remember
he
said
in
a
strong
resonant
voice
speaking
nemedian
with
a
curious
archaic
accent
am
xaltotun
who
was
high
priest
of
set
in
python
which
was
in
acheron
the
heart
of
ahriman
i
dreamed
i
had
found
it
again
where
is
it
orastes
placed
it
in
his
hand
and
he
drew
breath
deeply
as
he
gazed
into
the
depths
of
the
terrible
jewel
burning
in
his
grasp
stole
it
from
me
long
ago
he
said
red
heart
of
the
night
it
is
strong
to
save
or
to
damn
it
came
from
afar
and
from
long
ago
while
i
held
it
none
could
stand
before
me
but
it
was
stolen
from
me
and
acheron
fell
and
i
fled
in
exile
into
dark
stygia
much
i
remember
but
much
i
have
forgotten
i
have
been
in
a
far
land
across
misty
voids
and
gulfs
and
unlit
oceans
what
is
the
year
orastes
answered
him
is
the
waning
of
the
year
of
the
lion
three
thousand
years
after
the
fall
of
acheron
thousand
years
murmured
the
other
long
who
are
you
am
orastes
once
a
priest
of
mitra
this
man
is
amalric
baron
of
tor
in
nemedia
this
other
is
tarascus
younger
brother
of
the
king
of
nemedia
and
this
tall
man
is
valerius
rightful
heir
of
the
throne
of
aquilonia
have
you
given
me
life
demanded
xaltotun
do
you
require
of
me
the
man
was
now
fully
alive
and
awake
his
keen
eyes
reflecting
the
working
of
an
unclouded
brain
there
was
no
hesitation
or
uncertainty
in
his
manner
he
came
directly
to
the
point
as
one
who
knows
that
no
man
gives
something
for
nothing
orastes
met
him
with
equal
candor
have
opened
the
doors
of
hell
this
night
to
free
your
soul
and
return
it
to
your
body
because
we
need
your
aid
we
wish
to
place
tarascus
on
the
throne
of
nemedia
and
to
win
for
valerius
the
crown
of
aquilonia
with
your
necromancy
you
can
aid
us
xaltotun
mind
was
devious
and
full
of
unexpected
slants
must
be
deep
in
the
arts
yourself
orastes
to
have
been
able
to
restore
my
life
how
is
it
that
a
priest
of
mitra
knows
of
the
heart
of
ahriman
and
the
incantations
of
skelos
am
no
longer
a
priest
of
mitra
answered
orastes
was
cast
forth
from
my
order
because
of
my
delving
in
black
magic
but
for
amalric
there
i
might
have
been
burned
as
a
magician
that
left
me
free
to
pursue
my
studies
i
journeyed
in
zamora
in
vendhya
in
stygia
and
among
the
haunted
jungles
of
khitai
i
read
the
books
of
skelos
and
talked
with
unseen
creatures
in
deep
wells
and
faceless
shapes
in
black
reeking
jungles
i
obtained
a
glimpse
of
your
sarcophagus
in
the
crypts
below
the
black
temple
of
set
in
the
hinterlands
of
stygia
and
i
learned
of
the
arts
that
would
bring
back
life
to
your
shriveled
corpse
from
moldering
manuscripts
i
learned
of
the
heart
of
ahriman
then
for
a
year
i
sought
its
and
at
last
i
found
it
why
trouble
to
bring
me
back
to
life
demanded
xaltotun
with
his
piercing
gaze
fixed
on
the
priest
did
you
not
employ
the
heart
to
further
your
own
power
no
man
today
knows
the
secrets
of
the
heart
answered
orastes
even
in
legends
live
the
arts
by
which
to
loose
its
full
powers
i
knew
it
could
restore
life
of
its
deeper
secrets
i
am
ignorant
i
merely
used
it
to
bring
you
back
to
life
it
is
the
use
of
your
knowledge
we
seek
as
for
the
heart
you
alone
know
its
awful
secrets
xaltotun
shook
his
head
staring
broodingly
into
the
flaming
depths
necromantic
knowledge
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
all
the
knowledge
of
other
men
he
said
i
do
not
know
the
full
power
of
the
jewel
i
did
not
invoke
it
in
the
old
days
i
guarded
it
lest
it
be
used
against
me
at
last
it
was
stolen
and
in
the
hands
of
a
feathered
shaman
of
the
barbarians
it
defeated
all
my
mighty
sorcery
then
it
vanished
and
i
was
poisoned
by
the
jealous
priests
of
stygia
before
i
could
learn
where
it
was
hidden
was
hidden
in
a
cavern
below
the
temple
of
mitra
in
tarantia
said
orastes
devious
ways
i
discovered
this
after
i
had
located
your
remains
in
set
subterranean
temple
in
stygia
thieves
partly
protected
by
spells
i
learned
from
sources
better
left
unmentioned
stole
your
from
under
the
very
talons
of
those
which
guarded
it
in
the
dark
and
by
and
galley
and
it
came
at
last
to
this
city
same
thieves
or
rather
those
of
them
who
still
lived
after
their
frightful
quest
stole
the
heart
of
ahriman
from
its
haunted
cavern
below
the
temple
of
mitra
and
all
the
skill
of
men
and
the
spells
of
sorcerers
nearly
failed
one
man
of
them
lived
long
enough
to
reach
me
and
give
the
jewel
into
my
hands
before
he
died
slavering
and
gibbering
of
what
he
had
seen
in
that
accursed
crypt
the
thieves
of
zamora
are
the
most
faithful
of
men
to
their
trust
even
with
my
conjurements
none
but
they
could
have
stolen
the
heart
from
where
it
has
lain
in
darkness
since
the
fall
of
acheron
three
thousand
years
ago
xaltotun
lifted
his
head
and
stared
far
off
into
space
as
if
plumbing
the
lost
centuries
thousand
years
he
muttered
tell
me
what
has
chanced
in
the
world
barbarians
who
overthrew
acheron
set
up
new
kingdoms
quoted
orastes
the
empire
had
stretched
now
rose
realms
called
aquilonia
and
nemedia
and
argos
from
the
tribes
that
founded
them
the
older
kingdoms
of
ophir
corinthia
and
western
koth
which
had
been
subject
to
the
kings
of
acheron
regained
their
independence
with
the
fall
of
the
empire
what
of
the
people
of
acheron
demanded
xaltotun
i
fled
into
stygia
python
was
in
ruins
and
all
the
great
cities
of
acheron
fouled
with
blood
and
trampled
by
the
sandals
of
the
barbarians
the
hills
small
groups
of
folk
still
boast
descent
from
acheron
answered
orastes
the
rest
the
tide
of
my
barbarian
ancestors
rolled
over
them
and
wiped
them
out
they
my
ancestors
had
suffered
much
from
the
kings
of
acheron
a
grim
and
terrible
smile
curled
the
pythonian
lips
many
a
barbarian
both
man
and
woman
died
screaming
on
the
altar
under
this
hand
i
have
seen
their
heads
piled
to
make
a
pyramid
in
the
great
square
in
python
when
the
kings
returned
from
the
west
with
their
spoils
and
naked
captives
and
when
the
day
of
reckoning
came
the
sword
was
not
spared
so
acheron
ceased
to
be
and
python
became
a
memory
of
forgotten
days
but
the
younger
kingdoms
rose
on
the
imperial
ruins
and
waxed
great
and
now
we
have
brought
you
back
to
aid
us
to
rule
these
kingdoms
which
if
less
strange
and
wonderful
than
acheron
of
old
are
yet
rich
and
powerful
well
worth
fighting
for
look
orastes
unrolled
before
the
stranger
a
map
drawn
cunningly
on
vellum
xaltotun
regarded
it
and
then
shook
his
head
baffled
very
outlines
of
the
land
are
changed
it
is
like
some
familiar
thing
seen
in
a
dream
fantastically
distorted
answered
orastes
tracing
with
his
forefinger
is
belverus
the
capital
of
nemedia
in
which
we
now
are
here
run
the
boundaries
of
the
land
of
nemedia
to
the
south
and
southeast
are
ophir
and
corinthia
to
the
east
brythunia
to
the
west
aquilonia
is
the
map
of
a
world
i
do
not
know
said
xaltotun
softly
but
orastes
did
not
miss
the
lurid
fire
of
hate
that
flickered
in
his
dark
eyes
is
a
map
you
shall
help
us
change
answered
orastes
is
our
desire
first
to
set
tarascus
on
the
throne
of
nemedia
we
wish
to
accomplish
this
without
strife
and
in
such
a
way
that
no
suspicion
will
rest
on
tarascus
we
do
not
wish
the
land
to
be
torn
by
civil
wars
but
to
reserve
all
our
power
for
the
conquest
of
aquilonia
king
nimed
and
his
sons
die
naturally
in
a
plague
for
instance
tarascus
would
mount
the
throne
as
the
next
heir
peacefully
and
unopposed
xaltotun
nodded
without
replying
and
orastes
continued
other
task
will
be
more
difficult
we
can
not
set
valerius
on
the
aquilonian
throne
without
a
war
and
that
kingdom
is
a
formidable
foe
its
people
are
a
hardy
race
toughened
by
continual
wars
with
the
picts
zingarians
and
cimmerians
for
five
hundred
years
aquilonia
and
nemedia
have
intermittently
waged
war
and
the
ultimate
advantage
has
always
lain
with
the
aquilonians
present
king
is
the
most
renowned
warrior
among
the
western
nations
he
is
an
outlander
an
adventurer
who
seized
the
crown
by
force
during
a
time
of
civil
strife
strangling
king
namedides
with
his
own
hands
upon
the
very
throne
his
name
is
conan
and
no
man
can
stand
before
him
in
battle
is
now
the
rightful
heir
of
the
throne
he
had
been
driven
into
exile
by
his
royal
kinsman
namedides
and
has
been
away
from
his
native
realm
for
years
but
he
is
of
the
blood
of
the
old
dynasty
and
many
of
the
barons
would
secretly
hail
the
overthrow
of
conan
who
is
a
nobody
without
royal
or
even
noble
blood
but
the
common
people
are
loyal
to
him
and
the
nobility
of
the
outlying
provinces
yet
if
his
forces
were
overthrown
in
the
battle
that
must
first
take
place
and
conan
himself
slain
i
think
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
put
valerius
on
the
throne
indeed
with
conan
slain
the
only
center
of
the
government
would
be
gone
he
is
not
part
of
a
dynasty
but
only
a
lone
adventurer
wish
that
i
might
see
this
king
mused
xaltotun
glancing
toward
a
silvery
mirror
which
formed
one
of
the
panels
of
the
wall
this
mirror
cast
no
reflection
but
xaltotun
expression
showed
that
he
understood
its
purpose
and
orastes
nodded
with
the
pride
a
good
craftsman
takes
in
the
recognition
of
his
accomplishments
by
a
master
of
his
craft
will
try
to
show
him
to
you
he
said
and
seating
himself
before
the
mirror
he
gazed
hypnotically
into
its
depths
where
presently
a
dim
shadow
began
to
take
shape
it
was
uncanny
but
those
watching
knew
it
was
no
more
than
the
reflected
image
of
orastes
thought
embodied
in
that
mirror
as
a
wizard
thoughts
are
embodied
in
a
magic
crystal
it
floated
hazily
then
leaped
into
startling
clarity
a
tall
man
mightily
shouldered
and
deep
of
chest
with
a
massive
corded
neck
and
heavily
muscled
limbs
he
was
clad
in
silk
and
velvet
with
the
royal
lions
of
aquilonia
worked
in
gold
upon
his
rich
jupon
and
the
crown
of
aquilonia
shone
on
his
black
mane
but
the
great
sword
at
his
side
seemed
more
natural
to
him
than
the
regal
accouterments
his
brow
was
low
and
broad
his
eyes
a
volcanic
blue
that
smoldered
as
if
with
some
inner
fire
his
dark
scarred
almost
sinister
face
was
that
of
a
and
his
velvet
garments
could
not
conceal
the
hard
dangerous
lines
of
his
limbs
man
is
no
hyborian
exclaimed
xaltotun
he
is
a
cimmerian
one
of
those
wild
tribesmen
who
dwell
in
the
gray
hills
of
the
north
fought
his
ancestors
of
old
muttered
xaltotun
even
the
kings
of
acheron
could
conquer
them
still
remain
a
terror
to
the
nations
of
the
south
answered
orastes
is
a
true
son
of
that
savage
race
and
has
proved
himself
thus
far
unconquerable
xaltotun
did
not
reply
he
sat
staring
down
at
the
pool
of
living
fire
that
shimmered
in
his
hand
outside
the
hound
howled
again
long
and
shudderingly
a
black
wind
blows
the
year
of
the
dragon
had
birth
in
war
and
pestilence
and
unrest
the
black
plague
stalked
through
the
streets
of
belverus
striking
down
the
merchant
in
his
stall
the
serf
in
his
kennel
the
knight
at
his
banquet
board
before
it
the
arts
of
the
leeches
were
helpless
men
said
it
had
been
sent
from
hell
as
punishment
for
the
sins
of
pride
and
lust
it
was
swift
and
deadly
as
the
stroke
of
an
adder
the
victim
body
turned
purple
and
then
black
and
within
a
few
minutes
he
sank
down
dying
and
the
stench
of
his
own
putrefaction
was
in
his
nostrils
even
before
death
wrenched
his
soul
from
his
rotting
body
a
hot
roaring
wind
blew
incessantly
from
the
south
and
the
crops
withered
in
the
fields
the
cattle
sank
and
died
in
their
tracks
men
cried
out
on
mitra
and
muttered
against
the
king
for
somehow
throughout
the
kingdom
the
word
was
whispered
that
the
king
was
secretly
addicted
to
loathsome
practises
and
foul
debauches
in
the
seclusion
of
his
nighted
palace
and
then
in
that
palace
death
stalked
grinning
on
feet
about
which
swirled
the
monstrous
vapors
of
the
plague
in
one
night
the
king
died
with
his
three
sons
and
the
drums
that
thundered
their
dirge
drowned
the
grim
and
ominous
bells
that
rang
from
the
carts
that
lumbered
through
the
streets
gathering
up
the
rotting
dead
that
night
just
before
dawn
the
hot
wind
that
had
blown
for
weeks
ceased
to
rustle
evilly
through
the
silken
window
curtains
out
of
the
north
rose
a
great
wind
that
roared
among
the
towers
and
there
was
cataclysmic
thunder
and
blinding
sheets
of
lightning
and
driving
rain
but
the
dawn
shone
clean
and
green
and
clear
the
scorched
ground
veiled
itself
in
grass
the
thirsty
crops
sprang
up
anew
and
the
plague
was
gone
its
miasma
swept
clean
out
of
the
land
by
the
mighty
wind
men
said
the
gods
were
satisfied
because
the
evil
king
and
his
spawn
were
slain
and
when
his
young
brother
tarascus
was
crowned
in
the
great
coronation
hall
the
populace
cheered
until
the
towers
rocked
acclaiming
the
monarch
on
whom
the
gods
smiled
such
a
wave
of
enthusiasm
and
rejoicing
as
swept
the
land
is
frequently
the
signal
for
a
war
of
conquest
so
no
one
was
surprised
when
it
was
announced
that
king
tarascus
had
declared
the
truce
made
by
the
late
king
with
their
western
neighbors
void
and
was
gathering
his
hosts
to
invade
aquilonia
his
reason
was
candid
his
motives
loudly
proclaimed
gilded
his
actions
with
something
of
the
glamor
of
a
crusade
he
espoused
the
cause
of
valerius
heir
to
the
throne
he
came
he
proclaimed
not
as
an
enemy
of
aquilonia
but
as
a
friend
to
free
the
people
from
the
tyranny
of
a
usurper
and
a
foreigner
if
there
were
cynical
smiles
in
certain
quarters
and
whispers
concerning
the
king
good
friend
amalric
whose
vast
personal
wealth
seemed
to
be
flowing
into
the
rather
depleted
royal
treasury
they
were
unheeded
in
the
general
wave
of
fervor
and
zeal
of
tarascus
popularity
if
any
shrewd
individuals
suspected
that
amalric
was
the
real
ruler
of
nemedia
behind
the
scenes
they
were
careful
not
to
voice
such
heresy
and
the
war
went
forward
with
enthusiasm
the
king
and
his
allies
moved
westward
at
the
head
of
fifty
thousand
men
knights
in
shining
armor
with
their
pennons
streaming
above
their
helmets
pikemen
in
steel
caps
and
brigandines
in
leather
jerkins
they
crossed
the
border
took
a
frontier
castle
and
burned
three
mountain
villages
and
then
in
the
valley
of
the
valkia
ten
miles
west
of
the
boundary
line
they
met
the
hosts
of
conan
king
of
aquilonia
thousand
knights
archers
and
the
flower
of
aquilonian
strength
and
chivalry
only
the
knights
of
poitain
under
prospero
had
not
yet
arrived
for
they
had
far
to
ride
up
from
the
southwestern
corner
of
the
kingdom
tarascus
had
struck
without
warning
his
invasion
had
come
on
the
heels
of
his
proclamation
without
formal
declaration
of
war
the
two
hosts
confronted
each
other
across
a
wide
shallow
valley
with
rugged
cliffs
and
a
shallow
stream
winding
through
masses
of
reeds
and
willows
down
the
middle
of
the
vale
the
of
both
hosts
came
down
to
this
stream
for
water
and
shouted
insults
and
hurled
stones
across
at
one
another
the
last
glints
of
the
sun
shone
on
the
golden
banner
of
nemedia
with
the
scarlet
dragon
unfurled
in
the
breeze
above
the
pavilion
of
king
tarascus
on
an
eminence
near
the
eastern
cliffs
but
the
shadow
of
the
western
cliffs
fell
like
a
vast
purple
pall
across
the
tents
and
the
army
of
aquilonia
and
upon
the
black
banner
with
its
golden
lion
that
floated
above
king
conan
pavilion
all
night
the
fires
flared
the
length
of
the
valley
and
the
wind
brought
the
call
of
trumpets
the
clangor
of
arms
and
the
sharp
challenges
of
the
sentries
who
paced
their
horses
along
either
edge
of
the
stream
it
was
in
the
darkness
before
dawn
that
king
conan
stirred
on
his
couch
which
was
no
more
than
a
pile
of
silks
and
furs
thrown
on
a
dais
and
awakened
he
started
up
crying
out
sharply
and
clutching
at
his
sword
pallantides
his
commander
rushing
in
at
the
cry
saw
his
king
sitting
upright
his
hand
on
his
hilt
and
perspiration
dripping
from
his
strangely
pale
face
majesty
exclaimed
pallantides
aught
amiss
of
the
camp
demanded
conan
the
guards
out
hundred
horsemen
patrol
the
stream
your
majesty
answered
the
general
nemedians
have
not
offered
to
move
against
us
in
the
night
they
wait
for
dawn
even
as
we
crom
muttered
conan
awoke
with
a
feeling
that
doom
was
creeping
on
me
in
the
night
he
stared
up
at
the
great
golden
lamp
which
shed
a
soft
glow
over
the
velvet
hangings
and
carpets
of
the
great
tent
they
were
alone
not
even
a
slave
or
a
page
slept
on
the
carpeted
floor
but
conan
eyes
blazed
as
they
were
wont
to
blaze
in
the
teeth
of
great
peril
and
the
sword
quivered
in
his
hand
pallantides
watched
him
uneasily
conan
seemed
to
be
listening
hissed
the
king
you
hear
it
a
furtive
step
knights
guard
your
tent
your
majesty
said
pallantides
could
approach
it
unchallenged
outside
growled
conan
seemed
to
sound
inside
the
tent
pallantides
cast
a
swift
startled
look
around
the
velvet
hangings
merged
with
shadows
in
the
corners
but
if
there
had
been
anyone
in
the
pavilion
besides
themselves
the
general
would
have
seen
him
again
he
shook
his
head
is
no
one
here
sire
you
sleep
in
the
midst
of
your
host
have
seen
death
strike
a
king
in
the
midst
of
thousands
muttered
conan
that
walks
on
invisible
feet
and
is
not
seen
you
were
dreaming
your
majesty
said
pallantides
somewhat
perturbed
i
was
grunted
conan
devilish
dream
it
was
too
i
trod
again
all
the
long
weary
roads
i
traveled
on
my
way
to
the
kingship
he
fell
silent
and
pallantides
stared
at
him
unspeaking
the
king
was
an
enigma
to
the
general
as
to
most
of
his
civilized
subjects
pallantides
knew
that
conan
had
walked
many
strange
roads
in
his
wild
eventful
life
and
had
been
many
things
before
a
twist
of
fate
set
him
on
the
throne
of
aquilonia
saw
again
the
battlefield
whereon
i
was
born
said
conan
resting
his
chin
moodily
on
a
massive
fist
saw
myself
in
a
pantherskin
throwing
my
spear
at
the
mountain
beasts
i
was
a
mercenary
swordsman
again
a
hetman
of
the
who
dwell
along
the
zaporoska
river
a
corsair
looting
the
coasts
of
kush
a
pirate
of
the
barachan
isles
a
chief
of
the
himelian
hillmen
all
these
things
i
been
and
of
all
these
things
i
dreamed
all
the
shapes
that
have
been
i
passed
like
an
endless
procession
and
their
feet
beat
out
a
dirge
in
the
sounding
dust
throughout
my
dreams
moved
strange
veiled
figures
and
ghostly
shadows
and
a
faraway
voice
mocked
me
and
toward
the
last
i
seemed
to
see
myself
lying
on
this
dais
in
my
tent
and
a
shape
bent
over
me
robed
and
hooded
i
lay
unable
to
move
and
then
the
hood
fell
away
and
a
moldering
skull
grinned
down
at
me
then
it
was
that
i
awoke
is
an
evil
dream
your
majesty
said
pallantides
suppressing
a
shudder
no
more
conan
shook
his
head
more
in
doubt
than
in
denial
he
came
of
a
barbaric
race
and
the
superstitions
and
instincts
of
his
heritage
lurked
close
beneath
the
surface
of
his
consciousness
dreamed
many
evil
dreams
he
said
most
of
them
were
meaningless
but
by
crom
this
was
not
like
most
dreams
i
wish
this
battle
were
fought
and
won
for
i
had
a
grisly
premonition
ever
since
king
nimed
died
in
the
black
plague
why
did
it
cease
when
he
died
say
he
sinned
are
fools
as
always
grunted
conan
the
plague
struck
all
who
sinned
then
by
crom
there
would
be
enough
left
to
count
the
living
why
should
the
gods
who
the
priests
tell
me
are
just
slay
five
hundred
peasants
and
merchants
and
nobles
before
they
slew
the
king
if
the
whole
pestilence
were
aimed
at
him
were
the
gods
smiting
blindly
like
swordsmen
in
a
fog
by
mitra
if
i
aimed
my
strokes
no
straighter
aquilonia
would
have
had
a
new
king
long
ago
the
black
plague
no
common
pestilence
it
lurks
in
stygian
tombs
and
is
called
forth
into
being
only
by
wizards
i
was
a
swordsman
in
prince
almuric
army
that
invaded
stygia
and
of
his
thirty
thousand
fifteen
thousand
perished
by
stygian
arrows
and
the
rest
by
the
black
plague
that
rolled
on
us
like
a
wind
out
of
the
south
i
was
the
only
man
who
lived
only
five
hundred
died
in
nemedia
argued
pallantides
called
it
into
being
knew
how
to
cut
it
short
at
will
answered
conan
i
know
there
was
something
planned
and
diabolical
about
it
someone
called
it
forth
someone
banished
it
when
the
work
was
completed
when
tarascus
was
safe
on
the
throne
and
being
hailed
as
the
deliverer
of
the
people
from
the
wrath
of
the
gods
by
crom
i
sense
a
black
subtle
brain
behind
all
this
what
of
this
stranger
who
men
say
gives
counsel
to
tarascus
wears
a
veil
answered
pallantides
say
he
is
a
foreigner
a
stranger
from
stygia
stranger
from
stygia
repeated
conan
scowling
stranger
from
hell
more
like
ha
what
is
that
trumpets
of
the
nemedians
exclaimed
pallantides
hark
how
our
own
blare
upon
their
heels
dawn
is
breaking
and
the
captains
are
marshaling
the
hosts
for
the
onset
mitra
be
with
them
for
many
will
not
see
the
sun
go
down
behind
the
crags
my
squires
to
me
exclaimed
conan
rising
with
alacrity
and
casting
off
his
velvet
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
forebodings
at
the
prospect
of
action
to
the
captains
and
see
that
all
is
in
readiness
i
will
be
with
you
as
soon
as
i
don
my
armor
many
of
conan
ways
were
inexplicable
to
the
civilized
people
he
ruled
and
one
of
them
was
his
insistence
on
sleeping
alone
in
his
chamber
or
tent
pallantides
hastened
from
the
pavilion
clanking
in
the
armor
he
had
donned
at
midnight
after
a
few
hours
sleep
he
cast
a
swift
glance
over
the
camp
which
was
beginning
to
swarm
with
activity
mail
clinking
and
men
moving
about
dimly
in
the
uncertain
light
among
the
long
lines
of
tents
stars
still
glimmered
palely
in
the
western
sky
but
long
pink
streamers
stretched
along
the
eastern
horizon
and
against
them
the
dragon
banner
of
nemedia
flung
out
its
billowing
silken
folds
pallantides
turned
toward
a
smaller
tent
near
by
where
slept
the
royal
squires
these
were
tumbling
out
already
roused
by
the
trumpets
and
as
pallantides
called
to
them
to
hasten
he
was
frozen
speechless
by
a
deep
fierce
shout
and
the
impact
of
a
heavy
blow
inside
the
king
tent
followed
by
the
crash
of
a
falling
body
there
sounded
a
low
laugh
that
turned
the
general
blood
to
ice
echoing
the
cry
pallantides
wheeled
and
rushed
back
into
the
pavilion
he
cried
out
again
as
he
saw
conan
powerful
frame
stretched
out
on
the
carpet
the
king
great
sword
lay
near
his
hand
and
a
shattered
seemed
to
show
where
his
stroke
had
fallen
pallantides
sword
was
out
and
he
glared
about
the
tent
but
nothing
met
his
gaze
save
for
the
king
and
himself
it
was
empty
as
it
had
been
when
he
left
it
majesty
pallantides
threw
himself
on
his
knee
beside
the
fallen
giant
conan
eyes
were
open
they
blazed
up
at
him
with
full
intelligence
and
recognition
his
lips
writhed
but
no
sound
came
forth
he
seemed
unable
to
move
voices
sounded
without
pallantides
rose
swiftly
and
stepped
to
the
door
the
royal
squires
and
one
of
the
knights
who
guarded
the
tent
stood
there
heard
a
sound
within
said
the
knight
apologetically
all
well
with
the
king
pallantides
regarded
him
searchingly
has
entered
or
left
the
pavilion
this
night
save
yourself
my
lord
answered
the
knight
and
pallantides
could
not
doubt
his
honesty
king
stumbled
and
dropped
his
sword
said
pallantides
briefly
to
your
post
as
the
knight
turned
away
the
general
covertly
motioned
to
the
five
royal
squires
and
when
they
had
followed
him
in
he
drew
the
flap
closely
they
turned
pale
at
the
sight
of
the
king
stretched
upon
the
carpet
but
pallantides
quick
gesture
checked
their
exclamations
the
general
bent
over
him
again
and
again
conan
made
an
effort
to
speak
the
veins
in
his
temples
and
the
cords
in
his
neck
swelled
with
his
efforts
and
he
lifted
his
head
clear
of
the
ground
voice
came
at
last
mumbling
and
half
intelligible
thing
the
thing
in
the
corner
pallantides
lifted
his
head
and
looked
fearfully
about
him
he
saw
the
pale
faces
of
the
squires
in
the
lamplight
the
velvet
shadows
that
lurked
along
the
walls
of
the
pavilion
that
was
all
is
nothing
here
your
majesty
he
said
was
there
in
the
corner
muttered
the
king
tossing
his
head
from
side
to
side
in
his
efforts
to
rise
man
at
least
he
looked
like
a
man
wrapped
in
rags
like
a
mummy
bandages
with
a
moldering
cloak
drawn
about
him
and
a
hood
all
i
could
see
was
his
eyes
as
he
crouched
there
in
the
shadows
i
thought
he
was
a
shadow
himself
until
i
saw
his
eyes
they
were
like
black
jewels
made
at
him
and
swung
my
sword
but
i
missed
him
clean
how
crom
knows
and
splintered
that
pole
instead
he
caught
my
wrist
as
i
staggered
off
balance
and
his
fingers
burned
like
hot
iron
all
the
strength
went
out
of
me
and
the
floor
rose
and
struck
me
like
a
club
then
he
was
gone
and
i
was
down
and
curse
him
i
ca
move
paralysed
pallantides
lifted
the
giant
hand
and
his
flesh
crawled
on
the
king
wrist
showed
the
blue
marks
of
long
lean
fingers
what
hand
could
grip
so
hard
as
to
leave
its
print
on
that
thick
wrist
pallantides
remembered
that
low
laugh
he
had
heard
as
he
rushed
into
the
tent
and
cold
perspiration
beaded
his
skin
it
had
not
been
conan
who
laughed
is
a
thing
diabolical
whispered
a
trembling
squire
say
the
children
of
darkness
war
for
tarascus
silent
ordered
pallantides
sternly
outside
the
dawn
was
dimming
the
stars
a
light
wind
sprang
up
from
the
peaks
and
brought
the
fanfare
of
a
thousand
trumpets
at
the
sound
a
convulsive
shudder
ran
through
the
king
mighty
form
again
the
veins
in
his
temples
knotted
as
he
strove
to
break
the
invisible
shackles
which
crushed
him
down
my
harness
on
me
and
tie
me
into
my
saddle
he
whispered
lead
the
charge
yet
pallantides
shook
his
head
and
a
squire
plucked
his
skirt
lord
we
are
lost
if
the
host
learns
the
king
has
been
smitten
only
he
could
have
led
us
to
victory
this
day
me
lift
him
on
the
dais
answered
the
general
they
obeyed
and
laid
the
helpless
giant
on
the
furs
and
spread
a
silken
cloak
over
him
pallantides
turned
to
the
five
squires
and
searched
their
pale
faces
long
before
he
spoke
lips
must
be
sealed
for
ever
as
to
what
happens
in
this
tent
he
said
at
last
kingdom
of
aquilonia
depends
upon
it
one
of
you
go
and
fetch
me
the
officer
valannus
who
is
a
captain
of
the
pellian
spearmen
the
squire
indicated
bowed
and
hastened
from
the
tent
and
pallantides
stood
staring
down
at
the
stricken
king
while
outside
trumpets
blared
drums
thundered
and
the
roar
of
the
multitudes
rose
in
the
growing
dawn
presently
the
squire
returned
with
the
officer
pallantides
had
named
a
tall
man
broad
and
powerful
built
much
like
the
king
like
him
also
he
had
thick
black
hair
but
his
eyes
were
gray
and
he
did
not
resemble
conan
in
his
features
king
is
stricken
by
a
strange
malady
said
pallantides
briefly
great
honor
is
yours
you
are
to
wear
his
armor
and
ride
at
the
head
of
the
host
today
none
must
know
that
it
is
not
the
king
who
rides
is
an
honor
for
which
a
man
might
gladly
give
up
his
life
stammered
the
captain
overcome
by
the
suggestion
grant
that
i
do
not
fail
of
this
mighty
trust
and
while
the
fallen
king
stared
with
burning
eyes
that
reflected
the
bitter
rage
and
humiliation
that
ate
his
heart
the
squires
stripped
valannus
of
mail
shirt
burganet
and
and
clad
him
in
armor
of
black
with
the
vizored
salade
and
the
dark
plumes
nodding
over
the
wyvern
crest
over
all
they
put
the
silken
surcoat
with
the
royal
lion
worked
in
gold
upon
the
breast
and
they
girt
him
with
a
broad
belt
which
supported
a
broadsword
in
a
scabbard
while
they
worked
trumpets
clamored
outside
arms
clanged
and
across
the
river
rose
a
roar
as
squadron
after
squadron
swung
into
place
valannus
dropped
to
his
knee
and
bent
his
plumes
before
the
figure
that
lay
on
the
dais
king
mitra
grant
that
i
do
not
dishonor
the
harness
i
wear
this
day
me
tarascus
head
and
i
make
you
a
baron
in
the
stress
of
his
anguish
conan
veneer
of
civilization
had
fallen
from
him
his
eyes
flamed
he
ground
his
teeth
in
fury
and
as
barbaric
as
any
tribesmen
in
the
cimmerian
hills
the
cliffs
reel
the
aquilonian
host
was
drawn
up
long
serried
lines
of
pikemen
and
horsemen
in
gleaming
steel
when
a
giant
figure
in
black
armor
emerged
from
the
royal
pavilion
and
as
he
swung
up
into
the
saddle
of
the
black
stallion
held
by
four
squires
a
roar
that
shook
the
mountains
went
up
from
the
host
they
shook
their
blades
and
thundered
forth
their
acclaim
of
their
warrior
king
knights
in
armor
pikemen
in
mail
coats
and
basinets
archers
in
their
leather
jerkins
with
their
longbows
in
their
left
hand
the
host
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
was
in
motion
trotting
down
the
long
gentle
slope
toward
the
river
their
steel
shone
through
the
mists
of
morning
that
swirled
about
their
horses
feet
the
aquilonian
host
moved
leisurely
to
meet
them
the
measured
tramp
of
the
armored
horses
made
the
ground
tremble
banners
flung
out
long
silken
folds
in
the
morning
wind
lances
swayed
like
a
bristling
forest
dipped
and
sank
their
pennons
fluttering
about
them
ten
grim
taciturn
veterans
who
could
hold
their
tongues
guarded
the
royal
pavilion
one
squire
stood
in
the
tent
peering
out
through
a
slit
in
the
doorway
but
for
the
handful
in
the
secret
no
one
else
in
the
vast
host
knew
that
it
was
not
conan
who
rode
on
the
great
stallion
at
the
head
of
the
army
the
aquilonian
host
had
assumed
the
customary
formation
the
strongest
part
was
the
center
composed
entirely
of
heavily
armed
knights
the
wings
were
made
up
of
smaller
bodies
of
horsemen
mounted
mostly
supported
by
pikemen
and
archers
the
latter
were
bossonians
from
the
western
marches
strongly
built
men
of
medium
stature
in
leathern
jackets
and
iron
the
nemedian
army
came
on
in
similar
formation
and
the
two
hosts
moved
toward
the
river
the
wings
in
advance
of
the
centers
in
the
center
of
the
aquilonian
host
the
great
lion
banner
streamed
its
billowing
black
folds
over
the
figure
on
the
black
stallion
but
on
his
dais
in
the
royal
pavilion
conan
groaned
in
anguish
of
spirit
and
cursed
with
strange
heathen
oaths

faintly
in
the
ears
of

king
above
the
din
of
trumpets
and
clanging
steel
came
the
deep
fierce
shout
of
the
bossonians
as
they
drew
and
loosed
in
perfect
unison

ours
in

but
men
are
drowning
there
dragged
under
by
their
armor
and
trampled
by
the
frantic
horses
now
the
knights
of
aquilonia
advance
they
ride
into
the
water
and
engage
the
knights
of
nemedia
the
water
swirls
about
their
horses
bellies
and
the
clang
of
sword
against
sword
is
deafening
burst
in
agony
from
conan
lips

was
coursing
sluggishly
back
into
his
veins
but
still
he
could
not

mighty
frame

the

shook
to
charge
and
to
the
whistling
of
shafts
and
the
crash
of
rending

but
the
hosts
of

held
fast

were
forced

a
with

flowing
over

black
stallion
regained
the
lost
ground
and
like
an
iron
rampart
they
held
the
right
bank
of

at
last
the
squire
gave
conan
the
news
that

host
of

in

and
look
their
flank
is
protected
by
the
cliffs
but
there
is
a
defile
left
unguarded

like
a
great
cleft

the
wall

the

exultantly

forgotten

defile

never
expected
to
be
pushed
back
that
far
oh
fool
fool
tarascus
to
make
such
a
blunder
ah
i
see
lances
and
pennons
pouring
from
the
farther
mouth
of
the
defile
beyond
the
nemedian
lines
they
will
smite
those
ranks
from
the
rear
and
crumple
them
what
is
this
he
staggered
as
the
walls
of
the
tent
swayed
drunkenly
afar
over
the
thunder
of
the
fight
rose
a
deep
bellowing
roar
indescribably
ominous
cliffs
reel
shrieked
the
squire
gods
what
is
this
the
river
foams
out
of
its
channel
and
the
peaks
are
crumbling
the
ground
shakes
and
horses
and
riders
in
armor
are
overthrown
the
cliffs
the
cliffs
are
falling
with
his
words
there
came
a
grinding
rumble
and
a
thunderous
concussion
and
the
ground
trembled
over
the
roar
of
the
battle
sounded
screams
of
mad
terror
cliffs
have
crumbled
cried
the
livid
squire
have
thundered
down
into
the
defile
and
crushed
every
living
creature
in
it
i
saw
the
lion
banner
wave
an
instant
amid
the
dust
and
falling
stones
and
then
it
vanished

with
triumph

may
they
shout
for
the
fall

has
wiped
out
five
thousand
of
our
bravest
knights
hark
to
conan
ears
came
a
vast
torrent
of
sound
rising
and
rising
in
frenzy
king
is
dead
king
is
dead
flee
flee
the
king
is
dead
panted
conan
knaves
cowards
oh
crom
if
i
could
but
stand
but
crawl
to
the
river
with
my
sword
in
my
teeth
how
boy
do
they
flee
sobbed
the
squire
spur
for
the
river
they
are
broken
hurled
on
like
spume
before
a
storm
i
see
pallantides
striving
to
stem
the
torrent
he
is
down
and
the
horses
trample
him
they
rush
into
the
river
knights
bowmen
pikemen
all
mixed
and
mingled
in
one
mad
torrent
of
destruction
the
nemedians
are
on
their
heels
cutting
them
down
like
corn
they
will
make
a
stand
on
this
side
of
the
river
cried
the
king
with
an
effort
that
brought
the
sweat
dripping
from
his
temples
he
heaved
himself
up
on
his
elbows
cried
the
squire
can
not
they
are
broken
routed
oh
gods
that
i
should
live
to
see
this
day
then
he
remembered
his
duty
and
shouted
to
the
who
stood
stolidly
watching
the
flight
of
their
comrades
a
horse
swiftly
and
help
me
lift
the
king
upon
it
we
dare
not
bide
here
but
before
they
could
do
his
bidding
the
first
drift
of
the
storm
was
upon
them
knights
and
spearmen
and
archers
fled
among
the
tents
stumbling
over
ropes
and
baggage
and
mingled
with
them
were
nemedian
riders
who
smote
right
and
left
at
all
alien
figures
were
cut
fire
sprang
up
in
a
hundred
places
and
the
plundering
had
already
begun
the
grim
guardsmen
about
conan
tent
died
where
they
stood
smiting
and
thrusting
and
over
their
mangled
corpses
beat
the
hoofs
of
the
conquerors
but
the
squire
had
drawn
the
flap
close
and
in
the
confused
madness
of
the
slaughter
none
realized
that
the
pavilion
held
an
occupant
so
the
flight
and
the
pursuit
swept
past
and
roared
away
up
the
valley
and
the
squire
looked
out
presently
to
see
a
cluster
of
men
approaching
the
royal
tent
with
evident
purpose
comes
the
king
of
nemedia
with
four
companions
and
his
squire
quoth
he
will
accept
your
surrender
my
fair
lord
the
devil
heart
gritted
the
king
he
had
forced
himself
up
to
a
sitting
posture
he
swung
his
legs
painfully
off
the
dais
and
staggered
upright
reeling
drunkenly
the
squire
ran
to
assist
him
but
conan
pushed
him
away
me
that
bow
he
gritted
indicating
a
longbow
and
quiver
that
hung
from
a
your
majesty
cried
the
squire
in
great
perturbation
battle
is
lost
it
were
the
part
of
majesty
to
yield
with
the
dignity
becoming
one
of
royal
blood
have
no
royal
blood
ground
conan
am
a
barbarian
and
the
son
of
a
blacksmith
wrenching
away
the
bow
and
an
arrow
he
staggered
toward
the
opening
of
the
pavilion
so
formidable
was
his
appearance
naked
but
for
short
leather
breeks
and
sleeveless
shirt
open
to
reveal
his
great
hairy
chest
with
his
huge
limbs
and
his
blue
eyes
blazing
under
his
tangled
black
mane
that
the
squire
shrank
back
more
afraid
of
his
king
than
of
the
whole
nemedian
host
reeling
on
legs
conan
drunkenly
tore
the
open
and
staggered
out
under
the
canopy
the
king
of
nemedia
and
his
companions
had
dismounted
and
they
halted
short
staring
in
wonder
at
the
apparition
confronting
them
i
am
you
jackals
roared
the
cimmerian
am
the
king
death
to
you
he
jerked
the
arrow
to
its
head
and
loosed
and
the
shaft
feathered
itself
in
the
breast
of
the
knight
who
stood
beside
tarascus
conan
hurled
the
bow
at
the
king
of
nemedia
my
shaky
hand
come
in
and
take
me
if
you
dare
reeling
backward
on
unsteady
legs
he
fell
with
his
shoulders
against
a
and
propped
upright
he
lifted
his
great
sword
with
both
hands
mitra
it
the
king
swore
tarascus
he
cast
a
swift
look
about
him
and
laughed
other
was
a
jackal
in
his
harness
in
dogs
and
take
his
head
the
three
soldiers
wearing
the
emblem
of
the
royal
guards
rushed
at
the
king
and
one
felled
the
squire
with
a
blow
of
a
mace
the
other
two
fared
less
well
as
the
first
rushed
in
lifting
his
sword
conan
met
him
with
a
sweeping
stroke
that
severed
like
cloth
and
sheared
the
nemedian
arm
and
shoulder
clean
from
his
body
his
corpse
pitching
backward
fell
across
his
companion
legs
the
man
stumbled
and
before
he
could
recover
the
great
sword
was
through
him
conan
wrenched
out
his
steel
with
a
racking
gasp
and
staggered
back
against
the
his
great
limbs
trembled
his
chest
heaved
and
sweat
poured
down
his
face
and
neck
but
his
eyes
flamed
with
exultant
savagery
and
he
panted
do
you
stand
afar
off
dog
of
belverus
i
ca
reach
you
come
in
and
die
tarascus
hesitated
glanced
at
the
remaining
and
his
squire
a
gaunt
saturnine
man
in
black
mail
and
took
a
step
forward
he
was
far
inferior
in
size
and
strength
to
the
giant
cimmerian
but
he
was
in
full
armor
and
was
famed
in
all
the
western
nations
as
a
swordsman
but
his
squire
caught
his
arm
your
majesty
do
not
throw
away
your
life
i
will
summon
archers
to
shoot
this
barbarian
as
we
shoot
lions
neither
of
them
had
noticed
that
a
chariot
had
approached
while
the
fight
was
going
on
and
now
came
to
a
halt
before
them
but
conan
saw
looking
over
their
shoulders
and
a
queer
chill
sensation
crawled
along
his
spine
there
was
something
vaguely
unnatural
about
the
appearance
of
the
black
horses
that
drew
the
vehicle
but
it
was
the
occupant
of
the
chariot
that
arrested
the
king
attention
he
was
a
tall
man
superbly
built
clad
in
a
long
unadorned
silk
robe
he
wore
a
shemitish
and
its
lower
folds
hid
his
features
except
for
the
dark
magnetic
eyes
the
hands
that
grasped
the
reins
pulling
the
rearing
horses
back
on
their
haunches
were
white
but
strong
conan
glared
at
the
stranger
all
his
primitive
instincts
roused
he
sensed
an
aura
of
menace
and
power
that
exuded
from
this
veiled
figure
a
menace
as
definite
as
the
windless
waving
of
tall
grass
that
marks
the
path
of
the
serpent
xaltotun
exclaimed
tarascus
is
the
king
of
aquilonia
he
did
not
die
in
the
landslide
as
we
thought
know
answered
the
other
without
bothering
to
say
how
he
knew
is
your
present
intention
will
summon
the
archers
to
slay
him
answered
the
nemedian
long
as
he
lives
he
will
be
dangerous
to
us
even
a
dog
has
uses
answered
xaltotun
him
alive
conan
laughed
raspingly
in
and
try
he
challenged
for
my
treacherous
legs
i
hew
you
out
of
that
chariot
like
a
woodman
hewing
a
tree
but
you
never
take
me
alive
damn
you
speaks
the
truth
i
fear
said
tarascus
man
is
a
barbarian
with
the
senseless
ferocity
of
a
wounded
tiger
let
me
summon
the
archers
me
and
learn
wisdom
advised
xaltotun
his
hand
dipped
into
his
robe
and
came
out
with
something
shining
a
glistening
sphere
this
he
threw
suddenly
at
conan
the
cimmerian
contemptuously
struck
it
aside
with
his
sword
at
the
instant
of
contact
there
was
a
sharp
explosion
a
flare
of
white
blinding
flame
and
conan
pitched
senseless
to
the
ground
is
dead
tarascus
tone
was
more
assertion
than
inquiry
he
is
but
senseless
he
will
recover
his
senses
in
a
few
hours
bid
your
men
bind
his
arms
and
legs
and
lift
him
into
my
chariot
with
a
gesture
tarascus
did
so
and
they
heaved
the
senseless
king
into
the
chariot
grunting
with
their
burden
xaltotun
threw
a
velvet
cloak
over
his
body
completely
covering
him
from
any
who
might
peer
in
he
gathered
the
reins
in
his
hands
for
belverus
he
said
amalric
that
i
will
be
with
him
if
he
needs
me
but
with
conan
out
of
the
way
and
his
army
broken
lance
and
sword
should
suffice
for
the
rest
of
the
conquest
prospero
can
not
be
bringing
more
than
ten
thousand
men
to
the
field
and
will
doubtless
fall
back
to
tarantia
when
he
hears
the
news
of
the
battle
say
nothing
to
amalric
or
valerius
or
anyone
about
our
capture
let
them
think
conan
died
in
the
fall
of
the
cliffs
he
looked
at
the
for
a
long
space
until
the
guardsman
moved
restlessly
nervous
under
the
scrutiny
is
that
about
your
waist
xaltotun
demanded
my
girdle
may
it
please
you
my
lord
stuttered
the
amazed
guardsman
lie
xaltotun
laugh
was
merciless
as
a
is
a
poisonous
serpent
what
a
fool
you
are
to
wear
a
reptile
about
your
waist
with
distended
eyes
the
man
looked
down
and
to
his
utter
horror
he
saw
the
buckle
of
his
girdle
rear
up
at
him
it
was
a
snake
head
he
saw
the
evil
eyes
and
the
dripping
fangs
heard
the
hiss
and
felt
the
loathsome
contact
of
the
thing
about
his
body
he
screamed
hideously
and
struck
at
it
with
his
naked
hand
felt
its
fangs
flesh
themselves
in
that
hand
and
then
he
stiffened
and
fell
heavily
tarascus
looked
down
at
him
without
expression
he
saw
only
the
leathern
girdle
and
the
buckle
the
pointed
tongue
of
which
was
stuck
in
the
guardsman
palm
xaltotun
turned
his
hypnotic
gaze
on
tarascus
squire
and
the
man
turned
ashen
and
began
to
tremble
but
the
king
interposed
we
can
trust
him
the
sorcerer
tautened
the
reins
and
swung
the
horses
around
that
this
piece
of
work
remains
secret
if
i
am
needed
let
altaro
orastes
servant
summon
me
as
i
have
taught
him
i
will
be
in
your
palace
at
belverus
tarascus
lifted
his
hand
in
salutation
but
his
expression
was
not
pleasant
to
see
as
he
looked
after
the
departing
mesmerist
should
he
spare
the
cimmerian
whispered
the
frightened
squire
i
am
wondering
myself
grunted
tarascus
behind
the
rumbling
chariot
the
dull
roar
of
battle
and
pursuit
faded
in
the
distance
the
setting
sun
rimmed
the
cliffs
with
scarlet
flame
and
the
chariot
moved
into
the
vast
blue
shadows
floating
up
out
of
the
east
what
hell
have
you
crawled
of
that
long
ride
in
the
chariot
of
xaltotun
conan
knew
nothing
he
lay
like
a
dead
man
while
the
bronze
wheels
clashed
over
the
stones
of
mountain
roads
and
swished
through
the
deep
grass
of
fertile
valleys
and
finally
dropping
down
from
the
rugged
heights
rumbled
rhythmically
along
the
broad
white
road
that
winds
through
the
rich
meadowlands
to
the
walls
of
belverus
just
before
dawn
some
faint
reviving
of
life
touched
him
he
heard
a
mumble
of
voices
the
groan
of
ponderous
hinges
through
a
slit
in
the
cloak
that
covered
him
he
saw
faintly
in
the
lurid
glare
of
torches
the
great
black
arch
of
a
gateway
and
the
bearded
faces
of
the
torches
striking
fire
from
their
spearheads
and
helmets
went
the
battle
my
fair
lord
spoke
an
eager
voice
in
the
nemedian
tongue
indeed
was
the
curt
reply
king
of
aquilonia
lies
slain
and
his
host
is
broken
a
babble
of
excited
voices
rose
drowned
the
next
instant
by
the
whirling
wheels
of
the
chariot
on
the
flags
sparks
flashed
from
under
the
revolving
rims
as
xaltotun
lashed
his
steeds
through
the
arch
but
conan
heard
one
of
the
guardsmen
mutter
beyond
the
border
to
belverus
between
sunset
and
dawn
and
the
horses
scarcely
sweating
by
mitra
they
then
silence
drank
the
voices
and
there
was
only
the
clatter
of
hoofs
and
wheels
along
the
shadowy
street
what
he
had
heard
registered
itself
on
conan
brain
but
suggested
nothing
to
him
he
was
like
a
mindless
automaton
that
hears
and
sees
but
does
not
understand
sights
and
sounds
flowed
meaninglessly
about
him
he
lapsed
again
into
a
deep
lethargy
and
was
only
dimly
aware
when
the
chariot
halted
in
a
deep
court
and
he
was
lifted
from
it
by
many
hands
and
borne
up
a
winding
stone
stair
and
down
a
long
dim
corridor
whispers
stealthy
footsteps
unrelated
sounds
surged
or
rustled
about
him
irrelevant
and
far
away
yet
his
ultimate
awakening
was
abrupt
and
he
possessed
full
knowledge
of
the
battle
in
the
mountains
and
its
sequences
and
he
had
a
good
idea
of
where
he
was
he
lay
on
a
velvet
couch
clad
as
he
was
the
day
before
but
with
his
limbs
loaded
with
chains
not
even
he
could
break
the
room
in
which
he
lay
was
furnished
with
somber
magnificence
the
walls
covered
with
black
velvet
tapestries
the
floor
with
heavy
purple
carpets
there
was
no
sign
of
door
or
window
and
one
curiously
carven
gold
lamp
swinging
from
the
fretted
ceiling
shed
a
lurid
light
over
all
in
that
light
the
figure
seated
in
a
silver
chair
before
him
seemed
unreal
and
fantastic
with
an
illusiveness
of
outline
that
was
heightened
by
a
filmy
silken
robe
but
the
features
were
distinct
unnaturally
so
in
that
uncertain
light
it
was
almost
as
if
a
weird
nimbus
played
about
the
man
head
casting
the
bearded
face
into
bold
relief
so
that
it
was
the
only
definite
and
distinct
reality
in
that
mystic
ghostly
chamber
it
was
a
magnificent
face
with
strongly
chiseled
features
of
classical
beauty
there
was
indeed
something
disquieting
about
the
calm
tranquility
of
its
aspect
a
suggestion
of
more
than
human
knowledge
of
a
profound
certitude
beyond
human
assurance
also
an
uneasy
sensation
of
familiarity
twitched
at
the
back
of
conan
consciousness
he
had
never
seen
this
man
face
before
he
well
knew
yet
those
features
reminded
him
of
something
or
someone
it
was
like
encountering
in
the
flesh
some
that
had
haunted
one
in
nightmares
are
you
demanded
the
king
belligerently
struggling
to
a
sitting
position
in
spite
of
his
chains
call
me
xaltotun
was
the
reply
in
a
strong
golden
voice
place
is
this
the
cimmerian
next
demanded
chamber
in
the
palace
of
king
tarascus
in
belverus
conan
was
not
surprised
belverus
the
capital
was
at
the
same
time
the
largest
nemedian
city
so
near
the
border
where
tarascus
the
army
growled
conan
you
mean
to
murder
me
why
do
you
do
it
and
get
it
over
with
did
not
save
you
from
the
king
archers
to
murder
you
in
belverus
answered
xaltotun
the
devil
did
you
do
to
me
demanded
conan
blasted
your
consciousness
answered
xaltotun
you
would
not
understand
call
it
black
magic
if
you
will
conan
had
already
reached
that
conclusion
and
was
mulling
over
something
else
think
i
understand
why
you
spared
my
life
he
rumbled
wants
to
keep
me
as
a
check
on
valerius
in
case
the
impossible
happens
and
he
becomes
king
of
aquilonia
it
well
known
that
the
baron
of
tor
is
behind
this
move
to
seat
valerius
on
my
throne
and
if
i
know
amalric
he
does
intend
that
valerius
shall
be
anything
more
than
a
figurehead
as
tarascus
is
now
knows
nothing
of
your
capture
answered
xaltotun
does
valerius
both
think
you
died
at
valkia
conan
eyes
narrowed
as
he
stared
at
the
man
in
silence
sensed
a
brain
behind
all
this
he
muttered
i
thought
it
was
amalric
are
amalric
tarascus
and
valerius
all
but
puppets
dancing
on
your
string
who
are
you
does
it
matter
if
i
told
you
you
would
not
believe
me
what
if
i
told
you
i
might
set
you
back
on
the
throne
of
aquilonia
conan
eyes
burned
on
him
like
a
wolf
your
price
to
me
to
hell
with
your
offer
snarled
conan
no
figurehead
i
won
my
crown
with
my
sword
besides
it
beyond
your
power
to
buy
and
sell
the
throne
of
aquilonia
at
your
will
the
kingdom
not
conquered
one
battle
does
decide
a
war
war
against
more
than
swords
answered
xaltotun
it
a
mortal
sword
that
felled
you
in
your
tent
before
the
fight
nay
it
was
a
child
of
the
dark
a
waif
of
outer
space
whose
fingers
were
afire
with
the
frozen
coldness
of
the
black
gulfs
which
froze
the
blood
in
your
veins
and
the
marrow
of
your
thews
coldness
so
cold
it
burned
your
flesh
like
iron
it
chance
that
led
the
man
who
wore
your
harness
to
lead
his
knights
into
the
defile
chance
that
brought
the
cliffs
crashing
down
upon
them
conan
glared
at
him
unspeaking
feeling
a
chill
along
his
spine
wizards
and
sorcerers
abounded
in
his
barbaric
mythology
and
any
fool
could
tell
that
this
was
no
common
man
conan
sensed
an
inexplicable
something
about
him
that
set
him
apart
an
alien
aura
of
time
and
space
a
sense
of
tremendous
and
sinister
antiquity
but
his
stubborn
spirit
refused
to
flinch
fall
of
the
cliffs
was
chance
he
muttered
truculently
charge
into
the
defile
was
what
any
man
would
have
done
so
you
would
not
have
led
a
charge
into
it
you
would
have
suspected
a
trap
you
would
never
have
crossed
the
river
in
the
first
place
until
you
were
sure
the
nemedian
rout
was
real
hypnotic
suggestions
would
not
have
invaded
your
mind
even
in
the
madness
of
battle
to
make
you
mad
and
rush
blindly
into
the
trap
laid
for
you
as
it
did
the
lesser
man
who
masqueraded
as
you
if
this
was
all
planned
conan
grunted
skeptically
a
plot
to
trap
my
host
why
did
not
the
child
of
darkness
kill
me
in
my
tent
i
wished
to
take
you
alive
it
took
no
wizardry
to
predict
that
pallantides
would
send
another
man
out
in
your
harness
i
wanted
you
alive
and
unhurt
you
may
fit
into
my
scheme
of
things
there
is
a
vital
power
about
you
greater
than
the
craft
and
cunning
of
my
allies
you
are
a
bad
enemy
but
might
make
a
fine
vassal
conan
spat
savagely
at
the
word
and
xaltotun
ignoring
his
fury
took
a
crystal
globe
from
a
table
and
placed
it
before
him
he
did
not
support
it
in
any
way
nor
place
it
on
anything
but
it
hung
motionless
in
midair
as
solidly
as
if
it
rested
on
an
iron
pedestal
conan
snorted
at
this
bit
of
necromancy
but
he
was
nevertheless
impressed
you
know
of
what
goes
on
in
aquilonia
he
asked
conan
did
not
reply
but
the
sudden
rigidity
of
his
form
betrayed
his
interest
xaltotun
stared
into
the
cloudy
depths
and
spoke
is
now
the
evening
of
the
day
after
the
battle
of
valkia
last
night
the
main
body
of
the
army
camped
by
valkia
while
squadrons
of
knights
harried
the
fleeing
aquilonians
at
dawn
the
host
broke
camp
and
pushed
westward
through
the
mountains
prospero
with
ten
thousand
poitanians
was
miles
from
the
battlefield
when
he
met
the
fleeing
survivors
in
the
early
dawn
he
had
pushed
on
all
night
hoping
to
reach
the
field
before
the
battle
joined
unable
to
rally
the
remnants
of
the
broken
host
he
fell
back
toward
tarantia
riding
hard
replacing
his
wearied
horses
with
steeds
seized
from
the
countryside
he
approaches
tarantia
see
his
weary
knights
their
armor
gray
with
dust
their
pennons
drooping
as
they
push
their
tired
horses
through
the
plain
i
see
also
the
streets
of
tarantia
the
city
is
in
turmoil
somehow
word
has
reached
the
people
of
the
defeat
and
the
death
of
king
conan
the
mob
is
mad
with
fear
crying
out
that
the
king
is
dead
and
there
is
none
to
lead
them
against
the
nemedians
giant
shadows
rush
on
aquilonia
from
the
east
and
the
sky
is
black
with
vultures
conan
cursed
deeply
are
these
but
words
the
raggedest
beggar
in
the
street
might
prophesy
as
much
if
you
say
you
saw
all
that
in
the
glass
ball
then
you
a
liar
as
well
as
a
knave
of
which
last
there
no
doubt
prospero
will
hold
tarantia
and
the
barons
will
rally
to
him
count
trocero
of
poitain
commands
the
kingdom
in
my
absence
and
he
drive
these
nemedian
dogs
howling
back
to
their
kennels
what
are
fifty
thousand
nemedians
aquilonia
will
swallow
them
up
they
never
see
belverus
again
it
not
aquilonia
which
was
conquered
at
valkia
it
was
only
conan
is
doomed
answered
xaltotun
unmoved
and
ax
and
torch
shall
conquer
her
or
if
they
fail
powers
from
the
dark
of
ages
shall
march
against
her
as
the
cliffs
fell
at
valkia
so
shall
walled
cities
and
mountains
fall
if
the
need
arise
and
rivers
roar
from
their
channels
to
drown
whole
provinces
if
steel
and
bowstring
prevail
without
further
aid
from
the
for
the
constant
use
of
mighty
spells
sometimes
sets
forces
in
motion
that
might
rock
the
universe
what
hell
have
you
crawled
you
nighted
dog
muttered
conan
staring
at
the
man
the
cimmerian
involuntarily
shivered
he
sensed
something
incredibly
ancient
incredibly
evil
xaltotun
lifted
his
head
as
if
listening
to
whispers
across
the
void
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
prisoner
then
he
shook
his
head
impatiently
and
glanced
impersonally
at
conan
why
if
i
told
you
you
would
not
believe
me
but
i
am
wearied
of
conversation
with
you
it
is
less
fatiguing
to
destroy
a
walled
city
than
it
is
to
frame
my
thoughts
in
words
a
brainless
barbarian
can
understand
my
hands
were
free
opined
conan
soon
make
a
brainless
corpse
out
of
you
do
not
doubt
it
if
i
were
fool
enough
to
give
you
the
opportunity
answered
xaltotun
clapping
his
hands
his
manner
had
changed
there
was
impatience
in
his
tone
and
a
certain
nervousness
in
his
manner
though
conan
did
not
think
this
attitude
was
in
any
way
connected
with
himself
what
i
have
told
you
barbarian
said
xaltotun
will
have
plenty
of
leisure
i
have
not
yet
decided
what
i
shall
do
with
you
it
depends
on
circumstances
yet
unborn
but
let
this
be
impressed
upon
you
that
if
i
decide
to
use
you
in
my
game
it
will
be
better
to
submit
without
resistance
than
to
suffer
my
wrath
conan
spat
a
curse
at
him
just
as
hangings
that
masked
a
door
swung
apart
and
four
giant
negroes
entered
each
was
clad
only
in
a
silken
supported
by
a
girdle
from
which
hung
a
great
key
xaltotun
gestured
impatiently
toward
the
king
and
turned
away
as
if
dismissing
the
matter
entirely
from
his
mind
his
fingers
twitched
queerly
from
a
carven
green
jade
box
he
took
a
handful
of
shimmering
black
dust
and
placed
it
in
a
brazier
which
stood
on
a
golden
tripod
at
his
elbow
the
crystal
globe
which
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
fell
suddenly
to
the
floor
as
if
its
invisible
support
had
been
removed
then
the
blacks
had
lifted
conan
for
so
loaded
with
chains
was
he
that
he
could
not
walk
and
carried
him
from
the
chamber
a
glance
back
before
the
heavy
teak
door
was
closed
showed
him
xaltotun
leaning
back
in
his
chair
his
arms
folded
while
a
thin
wisp
of
smoke
curled
up
from
the
brazier
conan
scalp
prickled
in
stygia
that
ancient
and
evil
kingdom
that
lay
far
to
the
south
he
had
seen
such
black
dust
before
it
was
the
pollen
of
the
black
lotus
which
creates
sleep
and
monstrous
dreams
and
he
knew
that
only
the
grisly
wizards
of
the
black
ring
which
is
the
nadir
of
evil
voluntarily
seek
the
scarlet
nightmares
of
the
black
lotus
to
revive
their
necromantic
powers
the
black
ring
was
a
fable
and
a
lie
to
most
folk
of
the
western
world
but
conan
knew
of
its
ghastly
reality
and
its
grim
votaries
who
practise
their
abominable
sorceries
amid
the
black
vaults
of
stygia
and
the
nighted
domes
of
accursed
sabatea
he
glanced
back
at
the
cryptic
door
shuddering
at
what
it
hid
whether
it
was
day
or
night
the
king
could
not
tell
the
palace
of
king
tarascus
seemed
a
shadowy
nighted
place
that
shunned
natural
illumination
the
spirit
of
darkness
and
shadow
hovered
over
it
and
that
spirit
conan
felt
was
embodied
in
the
stranger
xaltotun
the
negroes
carried
the
king
along
a
winding
corridor
so
dimly
lighted
that
they
moved
through
it
like
black
ghosts
bearing
a
dead
man
and
down
a
stone
stair
that
wound
endlessly
a
torch
in
the
hand
of
one
cast
the
great
deformed
shadows
streaming
along
the
wall
it
was
like
the
descent
into
hell
of
a
corpse
borne
by
dusky
demons
at
last
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
stair
and
then
they
traversed
a
long
straight
corridor
with
a
blank
wall
on
one
hand
pierced
by
an
occasional
arched
doorway
with
a
stair
leading
up
behind
it
and
on
the
other
hand
another
wall
showing
heavy
barred
doors
at
regular
intervals
of
a
few
feet
halting
before
one
of
these
doors
one
of
the
blacks
produced
the
key
that
hung
at
his
girdle
and
turned
it
in
the
lock
then
pushing
open
the
grille
they
entered
with
their
captive
they
were
in
a
small
dungeon
with
heavy
stone
walls
floor
and
ceiling
and
in
the
opposite
wall
there
was
another
grilled
door
what
lay
beyond
that
door
conan
could
not
tell
but
he
did
not
believe
it
was
another
corridor
the
glimmering
light
of
the
torch
flickering
through
the
bars
hinted
at
shadowy
spaciousness
and
echoing
depths
in
one
corner
of
the
dungeon
near
the
door
through
which
they
had
entered
a
cluster
of
rusty
chains
hung
from
a
great
iron
ring
set
in
the
stone
in
these
chains
a
skeleton
dangled
conan
glared
at
it
with
some
curiosity
noticing
the
state
of
the
bare
bones
most
of
which
were
splintered
and
broken
the
skull
which
had
fallen
from
the
vertebrae
was
crushed
as
if
by
some
savage
blow
of
tremendous
force
stolidly
one
of
the
blacks
not
the
one
who
had
opened
the
door
removed
the
chains
from
the
ring
using
his
key
on
the
massive
lock
and
dragged
the
mass
of
rusty
metal
and
shattered
bones
over
to
one
side
then
they
fastened
conan
chains
to
that
ring
and
the
third
black
turned
his
key
in
the
lock
of
the
farther
door
grunting
when
he
had
assured
himself
that
it
was
properly
fastened
then
they
regarded
conan
cryptically
ebony
giants
the
torch
striking
highlights
from
their
glossy
skin
he
who
held
the
key
to
the
nearer
door
was
moved
to
remark
gutturally
your
palace
now
white
none
but
master
and
we
know
all
palace
sleep
we
keep
secret
you
live
and
die
here
maybe
like
him
he
contemptuously
kicked
the
shattered
skull
and
sent
it
clattering
across
the
stone
floor
conan
did
not
deign
to
reply
to
the
taunt
and
the
black
galled
perhaps
by
his
prisoner
silence
muttered
a
curse
stooped
and
spat
full
in
the
king
face
it
was
an
unfortunate
move
for
the
black
conan
was
seated
on
the
floor
the
chains
about
his
waist
ankles
and
wrists
locked
to
the
ring
in
the
wall
he
could
neither
rise
nor
move
more
than
a
yard
out
from
the
wall
but
there
was
considerable
slack
in
the
chains
that
shackled
his
wrists
and
before
the
head
could
be
withdrawn
out
of
reach
the
king
gathered
this
slack
in
his
mighty
hand
and
smote
the
black
on
the
head
the
man
fell
like
a
butchered
ox
and
his
comrades
stared
to
see
him
lying
with
his
scalp
laid
open
and
blood
oozing
from
his
nose
and
ears
but
they
attempted
no
reprisal
nor
did
they
accept
conan
urgent
invitation
to
approach
within
reach
of
the
bloody
chain
in
his
hand
presently
grunting
in
their
speech
they
lifted
the
senseless
black
and
bore
him
out
like
a
sack
of
wheat
arms
and
legs
dangling
they
used
his
key
to
lock
the
door
behind
them
but
did
not
remove
it
from
the
gold
chain
that
fastened
it
to
his
girdle
they
took
the
torch
with
them
and
as
they
moved
up
the
corridor
the
darkness
slunk
behind
them
like
an
animate
thing
their
soft
padding
footsteps
died
away
with
the
glimmer
of
their
torch
and
darkness
and
silence
remained
unchallenged
the
haunter
of
the
pits
conan
lay
still
enduring
the
weight
of
his
chains
and
the
despair
of
his
position
with
the
stoicism
of
the
wilds
that
had
bred
him
he
did
not
move
because
the
jangle
of
his
chains
when
he
shifted
his
body
sounded
startlingly
loud
in
the
darkness
and
stillness
and
it
was
his
instinct
born
of
a
thousand
ancestors
not
to
betray
his
position
in
his
helplessness
this
did
not
result
from
a
logical
reasoning
process
he
did
not
lie
quiet
because
he
reasoned
that
the
darkness
hid
lurking
dangers
that
might
discover
him
in
his
helplessness
xaltotun
had
assured
him
that
he
was
not
to
be
harmed
and
conan
believed
that
it
was
in
the
man
interest
to
preserve
him
at
least
for
the
time
being
but
the
instincts
of
the
wild
were
there
that
had
caused
him
in
his
childhood
to
lie
hidden
and
silent
while
wild
beasts
prowled
about
his
covert
even
his
keen
eyes
could
not
pierce
the
solid
darkness
yet
after
a
while
after
a
period
of
time
he
had
no
way
of
estimating
a
faint
glow
became
apparent
a
sort
of
slanting
gray
beam
by
which
conan
could
see
vaguely
the
bars
of
the
door
at
his
elbow
and
even
make
out
the
skeleton
of
the
other
grille
this
puzzled
him
until
at
last
he
realized
the
explanation
he
was
far
below
ground
in
the
pits
below
the
palace
yet
for
some
reason
a
shaft
had
been
constructed
from
somewhere
above
outside
the
moon
had
risen
to
a
point
where
its
light
slanted
dimly
down
the
shaft
he
reflected
that
in
this
manner
he
could
tell
the
passing
of
the
days
and
nights
perhaps
the
sun
too
would
shine
down
that
shaft
though
on
the
other
hand
it
might
be
closed
by
day
perhaps
it
was
a
subtle
method
of
torture
allowing
a
prisoner
but
a
glimpse
of
daylight
or
moonlight
his
gaze
fell
on
the
broken
bones
in
the
farther
corner
glimmering
dimly
he
did
not
tax
his
brain
with
futile
speculation
as
to
who
the
wretch
had
been
and
for
what
reason
he
had
been
doomed
but
he
wondered
at
the
shattered
condition
of
the
bones
they
had
not
been
broken
on
a
rack
then
as
he
looked
another
unsavory
detail
made
itself
evident
the
were
split
lengthwise
and
there
was
but
one
explanation
they
had
been
broken
in
that
manner
in
order
to
obtain
the
marrow
yet
what
creature
but
man
breaks
bones
for
their
marrow
perhaps
those
remnants
were
mute
evidence
of
a
horrible
cannibalistic
feast
of
some
wretch
driven
to
madness
by
starvation
conan
wondered
if
his
own
bones
would
be
found
at
some
future
date
hanging
in
their
rusty
chains
he
fought
down
the
unreasoning
panic
of
a
trapped
wolf
the
cimmerian
did
not
curse
scream
weep
or
rave
as
a
civilized
man
might
have
done
but
the
pain
and
turmoil
in
his
bosom
were
none
the
less
fierce
his
great
limbs
quivered
with
the
intensity
of
his
emotions
somewhere
far
to
the
westward
the
nemedian
host
was
slashing
and
burning
its
way
through
the
heart
of
his
kingdom
the
small
host
of
the
poitanians
could
not
stand
before
them
prospero
might
be
able
to
hold
tarantia
for
weeks
or
months
but
eventually
if
not
relieved
he
must
surrender
to
greater
numbers
surely
the
barons
would
rally
to
him
against
the
invaders
but
in
the
meanwhile
he
conan
must
lie
helpless
in
a
darkened
cell
while
others
led
his
spears
and
fought
for
his
kingdom
the
king
ground
his
powerful
teeth
in
red
rage
then
he
stiffened
as
outside
the
farther
door
he
heard
a
stealthy
step
straining
his
eyes
he
made
out
a
bent
indistinct
figure
outside
the
grille
there
was
a
rasp
of
metal
against
metal
and
he
heard
the
clink
of
tumblers
as
if
a
key
had
been
turned
in
the
lock
then
the
figure
moved
silently
out
of
his
range
of
vision
some
guard
he
supposed
trying
the
lock
after
a
while
he
heard
the
sound
repeated
faintly
somewhere
farther
on
and
that
was
followed
by
the
soft
opening
of
a
door
and
then
a
swift
scurry
of
softly
shod
feet
retreated
in
the
distance
then
silence
fell
again
conan
listened
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
but
which
could
not
have
been
for
the
moon
still
shone
down
the
hidden
shaft
but
he
heard
no
further
sound
he
shifted
his
position
at
last
and
his
chains
clanked
then
he
heard
another
lighter
footfall
a
soft
step
outside
the
nearer
door
the
door
through
which
he
had
entered
the
cell
an
instant
later
a
slender
figure
was
etched
dimly
in
the
gray
light
conan
a
soft
voice
intoned
urgently
my
lord
are
you
there
else
he
answered
guardedly
twisting
his
head
about
to
stare
at
the
apparition
it
was
a
girl
who
stood
grasping
the
bars
with
her
slender
fingers
the
dim
glow
behind
her
outlined
her
supple
figure
through
the
wisp
of
silk
twisted
about
her
loins
and
shone
vaguely
on
jeweled
her
dark
eyes
gleamed
in
the
shadows
her
white
limbs
glistened
softly
like
alabaster
her
hair
was
a
mass
of
dark
foam
at
the
burnished
luster
of
which
the
dim
light
only
hinted
keys
to
your
shackles
and
to
the
farther
door
she
whispered
and
a
slim
white
hand
came
through
the
bars
and
dropped
three
objects
with
a
clink
to
the
flags
beside
him
game
is
this
he
demanded
speak
in
the
nemedian
tongue
and
i
have
no
friends
in
nemedia
what
deviltry
is
your
master
up
to
now
has
he
sent
you
here
to
mock
me
is
no
mockery
the
girl
was
trembling
violently
her
bracelets
and
clinked
against
the
bars
she
grasped
swear
by
mitra
i
stole
the
keys
from
the
black
jailers
they
are
the
keepers
of
the
pits
and
each
bears
a
key
which
will
open
only
one
set
of
locks
i
made
them
drunk
the
one
whose
head
you
broke
was
carried
away
to
a
leech
and
i
could
not
get
his
key
but
the
others
i
stole
oh
please
do
not
loiter
beyond
these
dungeons
lie
the
pits
which
are
the
doors
to
hell
somewhat
impressed
conan
tried
the
keys
dubiously
expecting
to
meet
only
failure
and
a
burst
of
mocking
laughter
but
he
was
galvanized
to
discover
that
one
indeed
loosed
him
of
his
shackles
fitting
not
only
the
lock
that
held
them
to
the
ring
but
the
locks
on
his
limbs
as
well
a
few
seconds
later
he
stood
upright
exulting
fiercely
in
his
comparative
freedom
a
quick
stride
carried
him
to
the
grille
and
his
fingers
closed
about
a
bar
and
the
slender
wrist
that
was
pressed
against
it
imprisoning
the
owner
who
lifted
her
face
bravely
to
his
fierce
gaze
are
you
girl
he
demanded
do
you
do
this
am
only
zenobia
she
murmured
with
a
catch
of
breathlessness
as
if
in
fright
a
girl
of
the
king
seraglio
this
is
some
cursed
trick
muttered
conan
can
not
see
why
you
bring
me
these
keys
she
bowed
her
dark
head
and
then
lifted
it
and
looked
full
into
his
suspicious
eyes
tears
sparkled
like
jewels
on
her
long
dark
lashes
am
only
a
girl
of
the
king
seraglio
she
said
with
a
certain
proud
humility
has
never
glanced
at
me
and
probably
never
will
i
am
less
than
one
of
the
dogs
that
gnaw
the
bones
in
his
banquet
hall
i
am
no
painted
toy
i
am
of
flesh
and
blood
i
breathe
hate
fear
rejoice
and
love
and
i
have
loved
you
king
conan
ever
since
i
saw
you
riding
at
the
head
of
your
knights
along
the
streets
of
belverus
when
you
visited
king
nimed
years
ago
my
heart
tugged
at
its
strings
to
leap
from
my
bosom
and
fall
in
the
dust
of
the
street
under
your
horse
hoofs
color
flooded
her
countenance
as
she
spoke
but
her
dark
eyes
did
not
waver
conan
did
not
at
once
reply
wild
and
passionate
and
untamed
he
was
yet
any
but
the
most
brutish
of
men
must
be
touched
with
a
certain
awe
or
wonder
at
the
baring
of
a
woman
naked
soul
she
bent
her
head
then
and
pressed
her
red
lips
to
the
fingers
that
imprisoned
her
slim
wrist
then
she
flung
up
her
head
as
if
in
sudden
recollection
of
their
position
and
terror
flared
in
her
dark
eyes
she
whispered
urgently
is
past
midnight
you
must
be
gone
wo
they
skin
you
alive
for
stealing
these
keys
never
know
if
the
black
men
remember
in
the
morning
who
gave
them
the
wine
they
will
not
dare
admit
the
keys
were
stolen
from
them
while
they
were
drunk
the
key
that
i
could
not
obtain
is
the
one
that
unlocks
this
door
you
must
make
your
way
to
freedom
through
the
pits
what
awful
perils
lurk
beyond
that
door
i
can
not
even
guess
but
greater
danger
lurks
for
you
if
you
remain
in
this
cell
tarascus
has
returned
tarascus
he
has
returned
in
great
secrecy
and
not
long
ago
he
descended
into
the
pits
and
then
came
out
again
pale
and
shaking
like
a
man
who
had
dared
a
great
hazard
i
heard
him
whisper
to
his
squire
arideus
that
despite
xaltotun
you
should
die
of
xaltotun
murmured
conan
he
felt
her
shudder
not
speak
of
him
she
whispered
are
often
summoned
by
the
sound
of
their
names
the
slaves
say
that
he
lies
in
his
chamber
behind
a
bolted
door
dreaming
the
dreams
of
the
black
lotus
i
believe
that
even
tarascus
secretly
fears
him
or
he
would
slay
you
openly
but
he
has
been
in
the
pits
tonight
and
what
he
did
there
only
mitra
knows
wonder
if
that
could
have
been
tarascus
who
fumbled
at
my
cell
door
awhile
ago
muttered
conan
is
a
dagger
she
whispered
pressing
something
through
the
bars
his
eager
fingers
closed
on
an
object
familiar
to
their
touch
quickly
through
yonder
door
turn
to
the
left
and
make
your
way
along
the
cells
until
you
come
to
a
stone
stair
on
your
life
do
not
stray
from
the
line
of
the
cells
climb
the
stair
and
open
the
door
at
the
top
one
of
the
keys
will
fit
it
if
it
be
the
will
of
mitra
i
will
await
you
there
then
she
was
gone
with
a
patter
of
light
slippered
feet
conan
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
toward
the
farther
grille
this
might
be
some
diabolical
trap
planned
by
tarascus
but
plunging
headlong
into
a
snare
was
less
abhorrent
to
conan
temperament
than
sitting
meekly
to
await
his
doom
he
inspected
the
weapon
the
girl
had
given
him
and
smiled
grimly
whatever
else
she
might
be
she
was
proven
by
that
dagger
to
be
a
person
of
practical
intelligence
it
was
no
slender
stiletto
selected
because
of
a
jeweled
hilt
or
gold
guard
fitted
only
for
dainty
murder
in
milady
boudoir
it
was
a
forthright
poniard
a
warrior
weapon
fifteen
inches
in
length
tapering
to
a
point
he
grunted
with
satisfaction
the
feel
of
the
hilt
cheered
him
and
gave
him
a
glow
of
confidence
whatever
webs
of
conspiracy
were
drawn
about
him
whatever
trickery
and
treachery
ensnared
him
this
knife
was
real
the
great
muscles
of
his
right
arm
swelled
in
anticipation
of
murderous
blows
he
tried
the
farther
door
fumbling
with
the
keys
as
he
did
so
it
was
not
locked
yet
he
remembered
the
black
man
locking
it
that
furtive
bent
figure
then
had
been
no
jailer
seeing
that
the
bolts
were
in
place
he
had
unlocked
the
door
instead
there
was
a
sinister
suggestion
about
that
unlocked
door
but
conan
did
not
hesitate
he
pushed
upon
the
grille
and
stepped
from
the
dungeon
into
the
outer
darkness
as
he
had
thought
the
door
did
not
open
into
another
corridor
the
flagged
floor
stretched
away
under
his
feet
and
the
line
of
cells
ran
away
to
the
right
and
left
behind
him
but
he
could
not
make
out
the
other
limits
of
the
place
into
which
he
had
come
he
could
see
neither
the
roof
nor
any
other
wall
the
moonlight
filtered
into
that
vastness
only
through
the
grilles
of
the
cells
and
was
almost
lost
in
the
darkness
less
keen
eyes
than
his
could
scarcely
have
discerned
the
dim
gray
patches
that
floated
before
each
cell
door
turning
to
the
left
he
moved
swiftly
and
noiselessly
along
the
line
of
dungeons
his
bare
feet
making
no
sound
on
the
flags
he
glanced
briefly
into
each
dungeon
as
he
passed
it
they
were
all
empty
but
locked
in
some
he
caught
the
glimmer
of
naked
white
bones
these
pits
were
a
relic
of
a
grimmer
age
constructed
long
ago
when
belverus
was
a
fortress
rather
than
a
city
but
evidently
their
more
recent
use
had
been
more
extensive
than
the
world
guessed
ahead
of
him
presently
he
saw
the
dim
outline
of
a
stair
sloping
sharply
upward
and
knew
it
must
be
the
stair
he
sought
then
he
whirled
suddenly
crouching
in
the
deep
shadows
at
its
foot
somewhere
behind
him
something
was
moving
something
bulky
and
stealthy
that
padded
on
feet
which
were
not
human
feet
he
was
looking
down
the
long
row
of
cells
before
each
one
of
which
lay
a
square
of
dim
gray
light
that
was
little
more
than
a
patch
of
less
dense
darkness
but
he
saw
something
moving
along
these
squares
what
it
was
he
could
not
tell
but
it
was
heavy
and
huge
and
yet
it
moved
with
more
than
human
ease
and
swiftness
he
glimpsed
it
as
it
moved
across
the
squares
of
gray
then
lost
it
as
it
merged
in
the
expanses
of
shadow
between
it
was
uncanny
in
its
stealthy
advance
appearing
and
disappearing
like
a
blur
of
the
vision
he
heard
the
bars
rattle
as
it
tried
each
door
in
turn
now
it
had
reached
the
cell
he
had
so
recently
quitted
and
the
door
swung
open
as
it
tugged
he
saw
a
great
bulky
shape
limned
faintly
and
briefly
in
the
gray
doorway
and
then
the
thing
had
vanished
into
the
dungeon
sweat
beaded
conan
face
and
hands
now
he
knew
why
tarascus
had
come
so
subtly
to
his
door
and
later
had
fled
so
swiftly
the
king
had
unlocked
his
door
and
somewhere
in
these
hellish
pits
had
opened
a
cell
or
cage
that
held
some
grim
monstrosity
now
the
thing
was
emerging
from
the
cell
and
was
again
advancing
up
the
corridor
its
misshapen
head
close
to
the
ground
it
paid
no
more
heed
to
the
locked
doors
it
was
smelling
out
his
trail
he
saw
it
more
plainly
now
the
gray
light
limned
a
giant
anthropomorphic
body
but
vaster
of
bulk
and
girth
than
any
man
it
went
on
two
legs
though
it
stooped
forward
and
it
was
grayish
and
shaggy
its
thick
coat
shot
with
silver
its
head
was
a
grisly
travesty
of
the
human
its
long
arms
hung
nearly
to
the
ground
conan
knew
it
at
last
understood
the
meaning
of
those
crushed
and
broken
bones
in
the
dungeon
and
recognized
the
haunter
of
the
pits
it
was
a
gray
ape
one
of
the
grisly
from
the
forests
that
wave
on
the
mountainous
eastern
shores
of
the
sea
of
vilayet
half
mythical
and
altogether
horrible
these
apes
were
the
goblins
of
hyborian
legendry
and
were
in
reality
ogres
of
the
natural
world
cannibals
and
murderers
of
the
nighted
forests
he
knew
it
scented
his
presence
for
it
was
coming
swiftly
now
rolling
its
body
rapidly
along
on
its
short
mighty
bowed
legs
he
cast
a
quick
glance
up
the
long
stair
but
knew
that
the
thing
would
be
on
his
back
before
he
could
mount
to
the
distant
door
he
chose
to
meet
it
face
to
face
conan
stepped
out
into
the
nearest
square
of
moonlight
so
as
to
have
all
the
advantage
of
illumination
that
he
could
for
the
beast
he
knew
could
see
better
than
himself
in
the
dark
instantly
the
brute
saw
him
its
great
yellow
tusks
gleamed
in
the
shadows
but
it
made
no
sound
creatures
of
night
and
the
silence
the
gray
apes
of
vilayet
were
voiceless
but
in
its
dim
hideous
features
which
were
a
bestial
travesty
of
a
human
face
showed
ghastly
exultation
conan
stood
poised
watching
the
oncoming
monster
without
a
quiver
he
knew
he
must
stake
his
life
on
one
thrust
there
would
be
no
chance
for
another
nor
would
there
be
time
to
strike
and
spring
away
the
first
blow
must
kill
and
kill
instantly
if
he
hoped
to
survive
that
awful
grapple
he
swept
his
gaze
over
the
short
squat
throat
the
hairy
swagbelly
and
the
mighty
breast
swelling
in
giant
arches
like
twin
shields
it
must
be
the
heart
better
to
risk
the
blade
being
deflected
by
the
heavy
ribs
than
to
strike
in
where
a
stroke
was
not
instantly
fatal
with
full
realization
of
the
odds
conan
matched
his
speed
of
eye
and
hand
and
his
muscular
power
against
the
brute
might
and
ferocity
of
the
he
must
meet
the
brute
breast
to
breast
strike
a
and
then
trust
to
the
ruggedness
of
his
frame
to
survive
the
instant
of
manhandling
that
was
certain
to
be
his
as
the
ape
came
rolling
in
on
him
swinging
wide
its
terrible
arms
he
plunged
in
between
them
and
struck
with
all
his
desperate
power
he
felt
the
blade
sink
to
the
hilt
in
the
hairy
breast
and
instantly
releasing
it
he
ducked
his
head
and
bunched
his
whole
body
into
one
compact
mass
of
knotted
muscles
and
as
he
did
so
he
grasped
the
closing
arms
and
drove
his
knee
fiercely
into
the
monster
belly
bracing
himself
against
that
crushing
grapple
for
one
dizzy
instant
he
felt
as
if
he
were
being
dismembered
in
the
grip
of
an
earthquake
then
suddenly
he
was
free
sprawling
on
the
floor
and
the
monster
was
gasping
out
its
life
beneath
him
its
red
eyes
turned
upward
the
hilt
of
the
poniard
quivering
in
its
breast
his
desperate
stab
had
gone
home
conan
was
panting
as
if
after
long
conflict
trembling
in
every
limb
some
of
his
joints
felt
as
if
they
had
been
dislocated
and
blood
dripped
from
scratches
on
his
skin
where
the
monster
talons
had
ripped
his
muscles
and
tendons
had
been
savagely
wrenched
and
twisted
if
the
beast
had
lived
a
second
longer
it
would
surely
have
dismembered
him
but
the
cimmerian
mighty
strength
had
resisted
for
the
fleeting
instant
it
had
endured
the
dying
convulsion
of
the
ape
that
would
have
torn
a
lesser
man
limb
from
limb
the
thrust
of
a
knife
conan
stooped
and
tore
the
knife
from
the
monster
breast
then
he
went
swiftly
up
the
stair
what
other
shapes
of
fear
the
darkness
held
he
could
not
guess
but
he
had
no
desire
to
encounter
any
more
this
sort
of
battling
was
too
strenuous
even
for
the
giant
cimmerian
the
moonlight
was
fading
from
the
floor
the
darkness
closing
in
and
something
like
panic
pursued
him
up
the
stair
he
breathed
a
gusty
sigh
of
relief
when
he
reached
the
head
and
felt
the
third
key
turn
in
the
lock
he
opened
the
door
slightly
and
craned
his
neck
to
peer
through
half
expecting
an
attack
from
some
human
or
bestial
enemy
he
looked
into
a
bare
stone
corridor
dimly
lighted
and
a
slender
supple
figure
stood
before
the
door
majesty
it
was
a
low
vibrant
cry
half
in
relief
and
half
in
fear
the
girl
sprang
to
his
side
then
hesitated
as
if
abashed
bleed
she
said
have
been
hurt
he
brushed
aside
the
implication
with
an
impatient
hand
that
would
hurt
a
baby
your
skewer
came
in
handy
though
but
for
it
tarascus
monkey
would
be
cracking
my
for
the
marrow
right
now
but
what
now
me
she
whispered
will
lead
you
outside
the
city
wall
i
have
a
horse
concealed
there
she
turned
to
lead
the
way
down
the
corridor
but
he
laid
a
heavy
hand
on
her
naked
shoulder
beside
me
he
instructed
her
softly
passing
his
massive
arm
about
her
lithe
waist
played
me
fair
so
far
and
i
inclined
to
believe
in
you
but
i
lived
this
long
only
because
i
trusted
no
one
too
far
man
or
woman
so
now
if
you
play
me
false
you
wo
live
to
enjoy
the
jest
she
did
not
flinch
at
sight
of
the
reddened
poniard
or
the
contact
of
his
hard
muscles
about
her
supple
body
me
down
without
mercy
if
i
play
you
false
she
answered
very
feel
of
your
arm
about
me
even
in
menace
is
as
the
fulfillment
of
a
dream
the
vaulted
corridor
ended
at
a
door
which
she
opened
outside
lay
another
black
man
a
giant
in
turban
and
silk
with
a
curved
sword
lying
on
the
flags
near
his
hand
he
did
not
move
drugged
his
wine
she
whispered
swerving
to
avoid
the
recumbent
figure
is
the
last
and
outer
guard
of
the
pits
none
ever
escaped
from
them
before
and
none
has
ever
wished
to
seek
them
so
only
these
black
men
guard
them
only
these
of
all
the
servants
knew
it
was
king
conan
that
xaltotun
brought
a
prisoner
in
his
chariot
i
was
watching
sleepless
from
an
upper
casement
that
opened
into
the
court
while
the
other
girls
slept
for
i
knew
that
a
battle
was
being
fought
or
had
been
fought
in
the
west
and
i
feared
for
you
saw
the
blacks
carry
you
up
the
stair
and
i
recognized
you
in
the
torchlight
i
slipped
into
this
wing
of
the
palace
tonight
in
time
to
see
them
carry
you
to
the
pits
i
had
not
dared
come
here
before
nightfall
you
must
have
lain
in
drugged
senselessness
all
day
in
xaltotun
chamber
let
us
be
wary
strange
things
are
afoot
in
the
palace
tonight
the
slaves
said
that
xaltotun
slept
as
he
often
sleeps
drugged
by
the
lotus
of
stygia
but
tarascus
is
in
the
palace
he
entered
secretly
through
the
postern
wrapped
in
his
cloak
which
was
dusty
as
with
long
travel
and
attended
only
by
his
squire
the
lean
silent
arideus
i
can
not
understand
but
i
am
afraid
they
came
out
at
the
foot
of
a
narrow
winding
stair
and
mounting
it
passed
through
a
narrow
panel
which
she
slid
aside
when
they
had
passed
through
she
slipped
it
back
in
place
and
it
became
merely
a
portion
of
the
ornate
wall
they
were
in
a
more
spacious
corridor
carpeted
and
tapestried
over
which
hanging
lamps
shed
a
golden
glow
conan
listened
intently
but
he
heard
no
sound
throughout
the
palace
he
did
not
know
in
what
part
of
the
palace
he
was
or
in
which
direction
lay
the
chamber
of
xaltotun
the
girl
was
trembling
as
she
drew
him
along
the
corridor
to
halt
presently
beside
an
alcove
masked
with
satin
tapestry
drawing
this
aside
she
motioned
for
him
to
step
into
the
niche
and
whispered
here
beyond
that
door
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
we
are
likely
to
meet
slaves
or
eunuchs
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night
i
will
go
and
see
if
the
way
is
clear
before
we
essay
it
instantly
his
suspicions
were
aroused
you
leading
me
into
a
trap
tears
sprang
into
her
dark
eyes
she
sank
to
her
knees
and
seized
his
muscular
hand
my
king
do
not
mistrust
me
now
her
voice
shook
with
desperate
urgency
you
doubt
and
hesitate
we
are
lost
why
should
i
bring
you
up
out
of
the
pits
to
betray
you
now
right
he
muttered
trust
you
though
by
crom
the
habits
of
a
lifetime
are
not
easily
put
aside
yet
i
would
harm
you
now
if
you
brought
all
the
swordsmen
in
nemedia
upon
me
but
for
you
cursed
ape
would
have
come
upon
me
in
chains
and
unarmed
do
as
you
wish
girl
kissing
his
hands
she
sprang
lithely
up
and
ran
down
the
corridor
to
vanish
through
a
heavy
double
door
he
glanced
after
her
wondering
if
he
was
a
fool
to
trust
her
then
he
shrugged
his
mighty
shoulders
and
pulled
the
satin
hangings
together
masking
his
refuge
it
was
not
strange
that
a
passionate
young
beauty
should
be
risking
her
life
to
aid
him
such
things
had
happened
often
enough
in
his
life
many
women
had
looked
on
him
with
favor
in
the
days
of
his
wanderings
and
in
the
time
of
his
kingship
yet
he
did
not
remain
motionless
in
the
alcove
waiting
for
her
return
following
his
instincts
he
explored
the
niche
for
another
exit
and
presently
found
one
the
opening
of
a
narrow
passage
masked
by
the
tapestries
that
ran
to
an
ornately
carved
door
barely
visible
in
the
dim
light
that
filtered
in
from
the
outer
corridor
and
as
he
stared
into
it
somewhere
beyond
that
carven
door
he
heard
the
sound
of
another
door
opening
and
shutting
and
then
a
low
mumble
of
voices
the
familiar
sound
of
one
of
those
voices
caused
a
sinister
expression
to
cross
his
dark
face
without
hesitation
he
glided
down
the
passage
and
crouched
like
a
stalking
panther
beside
the
door
it
was
not
locked
and
manipulating
it
delicately
he
pushed
it
open
a
crack
with
a
reckless
disregard
for
possible
consequences
that
only
he
could
have
explained
or
defended
it
was
masked
on
the
other
side
by
tapestries
but
through
a
thin
slit
in
the
velvet
he
looked
into
a
chamber
lit
by
a
candle
on
an
ebony
table
there
were
two
men
in
that
chamber
one
was
a
scarred
ruffian
in
leather
breeks
and
ragged
cloak
the
other
was
tarascus
king
of
nemedia
tarascus
seemed
ill
at
ease
he
was
slightly
pale
and
he
kept
starting
and
glancing
about
him
as
if
expecting
and
fearing
to
hear
some
sound
or
footstep
swiftly
and
at
once
he
was
saying
is
deep
in
drugged
slumber
but
i
know
not
when
he
may
awaken
to
hear
words
of
fear
issuing
from
the
lips
of
tarascus
rumbled
the
other
in
a
harsh
deep
voice
the
king
frowned
fear
no
common
man
as
you
well
know
but
when
i
saw
the
cliffs
fall
at
valkia
i
knew
that
this
devil
we
had
resurrected
was
no
charlatan
i
fear
his
powers
because
i
do
not
know
the
full
extent
of
them
but
i
know
that
somehow
they
are
connected
with
this
accursed
thing
which
i
have
stolen
from
him
it
brought
him
back
to
life
so
it
must
be
the
source
of
his
sorcery
had
it
hidden
well
but
following
my
secret
order
a
slave
spied
on
him
and
saw
him
place
it
in
a
golden
chest
and
saw
where
he
hid
the
chest
even
so
i
would
not
have
dared
steal
it
had
xaltotun
himself
not
been
sunk
in
lotus
slumber
believe
it
is
the
secret
of
his
power
with
it
orastes
brought
him
back
to
life
with
it
he
will
make
us
all
slaves
if
we
are
not
wary
so
take
it
and
cast
it
into
the
sea
as
i
have
bidden
you
and
be
sure
you
are
so
far
from
land
that
neither
tide
nor
storm
can
wash
it
up
on
the
beach
you
have
been
paid
i
have
grunted
the
ruffian
i
owe
more
than
gold
to
you
king
i
owe
you
a
debt
of
gratitude
even
thieves
can
be
grateful
debt
you
may
feel
you
owe
me
answered
tarascus
be
paid
when
you
have
hurled
this
thing
into
the
sea
ride
for
zingara
and
take
ship
from
kordava
promised
the
other
dare
not
show
my
head
in
argos
because
of
the
matter
of
a
murder
or
so
care
not
so
it
is
done
here
it
is
a
horse
awaits
you
in
the
court
go
and
go
swiftly
something
passed
between
them
something
that
flamed
like
living
fire
conan
had
only
a
brief
glimpse
of
it
and
then
the
ruffian
pulled
a
slouch
hat
over
his
eyes
drew
his
cloak
about
his
shoulder
and
hurried
from
the
chamber
and
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
conan
moved
with
the
devastating
fury
of
unchained
he
had
held
himself
in
check
so
long
as
he
could
the
sight
of
his
enemy
so
near
him
set
his
wild
blood
seething
and
swept
away
all
caution
and
restraint
tarascus
was
turning
toward
an
inner
door
when
conan
tore
aside
the
hangings
and
leaped
like
a
panther
into
the
room
tarascus
wheeled
but
even
before
he
could
recognize
his
attacker
poniard
ripped
into
him
but
the
blow
was
not
mortal
as
conan
knew
the
instant
he
struck
his
foot
had
caught
in
a
fold
of
the
curtains
and
tripped
him
as
he
leaped
the
point
fleshed
itself
in
tarascus
shoulder
and
plowed
down
along
his
ribs
and
the
king
of
nemedia
screamed
the
impact
of
the
blow
and
conan
lunging
body
hurled
him
back
against
the
table
and
it
toppled
and
the
candle
went
out
they
were
both
carried
to
the
floor
by
the
violence
of
conan
rush
and
the
foot
of
the
tapestry
hampered
them
both
in
its
folds
conan
was
stabbing
blindly
in
the
dark
tarascus
screaming
in
a
frenzy
of
panicky
terror
as
if
fear
lent
him
superhuman
energy
tarascus
tore
free
and
blundered
away
in
the
darkness
shrieking
guards
arideus
orastes
orastes
conan
rose
kicking
himself
free
of
the
tangling
tapestries
and
the
broken
table
cursing
with
the
bitterness
of
his
disappointment
he
was
confused
and
ignorant
of
the
plan
of
the
palace
the
yells
of
tarascus
were
still
resounding
in
the
distance
and
a
wild
outcry
was
bursting
forth
in
answer
the
nemedian
had
escaped
him
in
the
darkness
and
conan
did
not
know
which
way
he
had
gone
the
rash
stroke
for
vengeance
had
failed
and
there
remained
only
the
task
of
saving
his
own
hide
if
he
could
swearing
luridly
conan
ran
back
down
the
passage
and
into
the
alcove
glaring
out
into
the
lighted
corridor
just
as
zenobia
came
running
up
it
her
dark
eyes
dilated
with
terror
what
has
happened
she
cried
palace
is
roused
i
swear
i
have
not
betrayed
you
it
was
i
who
stirred
up
this
hornet
nest
he
grunted
tried
to
pay
off
a
score
what
the
shortest
way
out
of
this
she
caught
his
wrist
and
ran
fleetly
down
the
corridor
but
before
they
reached
the
heavy
door
at
the
other
end
muffled
shouts
arose
from
behind
it
and
the
portals
began
to
shake
under
an
assault
from
the
other
side
zenobia
wrung
her
hands
and
whimpered
are
cut
off
i
locked
that
door
as
i
returned
through
it
but
they
will
burst
it
in
a
moment
the
way
to
the
postern
gate
lies
through
it
conan
wheeled
up
the
corridor
though
still
out
of
sight
he
heard
a
rising
clamor
that
told
him
his
foes
were
behind
as
well
as
before
him
into
this
door
the
girl
cried
desperately
running
across
the
corridor
and
throwing
open
the
door
of
a
chamber
conan
followed
her
through
and
then
threw
the
gold
catch
behind
them
they
stood
in
an
ornately
furnished
chamber
empty
but
for
themselves
and
she
drew
him
to
a
window
through
which
he
saw
trees
and
shrubbery
are
strong
she
panted
you
can
tear
these
bars
away
you
may
yet
escape
the
garden
is
full
of
guards
but
the
shrubs
are
thick
and
you
may
avoid
them
the
southern
wall
is
also
the
outer
wall
of
the
city
once
over
that
you
have
a
chance
to
get
away
a
horse
is
hidden
for
you
in
a
thicket
beside
the
road
that
runs
westward
a
few
hundred
paces
to
the
south
of
the
fountain
of
thrallos
you
know
where
it
is
but
what
of
you
i
had
meant
to
take
you
with
me
a
flood
of
joy
lighted
her
beautiful
face
my
cup
of
happiness
is
brimming
but
i
will
not
hamper
your
escape
burdened
with
me
you
would
fail
nay
do
not
fear
for
me
they
will
never
suspect
that
i
aided
you
willingly
go
what
you
have
just
said
will
glorify
my
life
throughout
the
long
years
he
caught
her
up
in
his
iron
arms
crushed
her
slim
vibrant
figure
to
him
and
kissed
her
fiercely
on
eyes
cheeks
throat
and
lips
until
she
lay
panting
in
his
embrace
gusty
and
tempestuous
as
a
even
his
was
violent
go
he
muttered
by
crom
i
come
for
you
some
day
wheeling
he
gripped
the
gold
bars
and
tore
them
from
their
sockets
with
one
tremendous
wrench
threw
a
leg
over
the
sill
and
went
down
swiftly
clinging
to
the
ornaments
on
the
wall
he
hit
the
ground
running
and
melted
like
a
shadow
into
the
maze
of
towering
and
spreading
trees
the
one
look
he
cast
back
over
his
shoulder
showed
him
zenobia
leaning
over
the
her
arms
stretched
after
him
in
mute
farewell
and
renunciation
guards
were
running
through
the
garden
all
converging
toward
the
palace
where
the
clamor
momentarily
grew
louder
tall
men
in
burnished
cuirasses
and
crested
helmets
of
polished
bronze
the
starlight
struck
glints
from
their
gleaming
armor
among
the
trees
betraying
their
every
movement
but
the
sound
of
their
coming
ran
far
before
them
to
conan
their
rush
through
the
shrubbery
was
like
the
blundering
stampede
of
cattle
some
of
them
passed
within
a
few
feet
of
where
he
lay
flat
in
a
thick
cluster
of
bushes
and
never
guessed
his
presence
with
the
palace
as
their
goal
they
were
oblivious
to
all
else
about
them
when
they
had
gone
shouting
on
he
rose
and
fled
through
the
garden
with
no
more
noise
than
a
panther
would
have
made
so
quickly
he
came
to
the
southern
wall
and
mounted
the
steps
that
led
to
the
parapet
the
wall
was
made
to
keep
people
out
not
in
no
sentry
patrolling
the
battlements
was
in
sight
crouching
by
an
embrasure
he
glanced
back
at
the
great
palace
rearing
above
the
cypresses
behind
him
lights
blazed
from
every
window
and
he
could
see
figures
flitting
back
and
forth
across
them
like
puppets
on
invisible
strings
he
grinned
hardly
shook
his
fist
in
a
gesture
of
farewell
and
menace
and
let
himself
over
the
outer
rim
of
the
parapet
a
low
tree
a
few
yards
below
the
parapet
received
conan
weight
as
he
dropped
noiselessly
into
the
branches
an
instant
later
he
was
racing
through
the
shadows
with
the
swinging
hillman
stride
that
eats
up
long
miles
gardens
and
pleasure
villas
surrounded
the
walls
of
belverus
drowsy
slaves
sleeping
by
their
watchman
pikes
did
not
see
the
swift
and
furtive
figure
that
scaled
walls
crossed
alleys
made
by
the
arching
branches
of
trees
and
threaded
a
noiseless
way
through
orchards
and
vineyards
watchdogs
woke
and
lifted
their
clamor
at
a
gliding
shadow
half
scented
half
sensed
and
then
it
was
gone
in
a
chamber
of
the
palace
tarascus
writhed
and
cursed
on
a
couch
under
the
deft
quick
fingers
of
orastes
the
palace
was
thronged
with
trembling
servitors
but
the
chamber
where
the
king
lay
was
empty
save
for
himself
and
the
renegade
priest
you
sure
he
still
sleeps
tarascus
demanded
again
setting
his
teeth
against
the
bite
of
the
herb
juices
with
which
orastes
was
bandaging
the
long
ragged
gash
in
his
shoulder
and
ribs
mitra
and
set
that
burns
like
molten
pitch
of
hell
you
would
be
experiencing
even
now
but
for
your
good
fortune
remarked
orastes
wielded
that
knife
struck
to
kill
yes
i
have
told
you
that
xaltotun
still
sleeps
why
are
you
so
urgent
upon
that
point
what
has
he
to
do
with
this
know
nothing
of
what
has
passed
in
the
palace
tonight
tarascus
searched
the
priest
countenance
with
burning
intensity
as
you
know
i
have
been
employed
in
translating
manuscripts
for
xaltotun
for
some
months
now
transcribing
esoteric
volumes
written
in
the
younger
languages
into
script
he
can
read
he
was
well
versed
in
all
the
tongues
and
scripts
of
his
day
but
he
has
not
yet
learned
all
the
newer
languages
and
to
save
time
he
has
me
translate
these
works
for
him
to
learn
if
any
new
knowledge
has
been
discovered
since
his
time
i
did
not
know
that
he
had
returned
last
night
until
he
sent
for
me
and
told
me
of
the
battle
then
i
returned
to
my
studies
nor
did
i
know
that
you
had
returned
until
the
clamor
in
the
palace
brought
me
out
of
my
cell
you
do
not
know
that
xaltotun
brought
the
king
of
aquilonia
a
captive
to
this
palace
orastes
shook
his
head
without
particular
surprise
merely
said
that
conan
would
oppose
us
no
more
i
supposed
that
he
had
fallen
but
did
not
ask
the
details
saved
his
life
when
i
would
have
slain
him
snarled
tarascus
saw
his
purpose
instantly
he
would
hold
conan
captive
to
use
as
a
club
against
us
against
amalric
against
valerius
and
against
myself
so
long
as
conan
lives
he
is
a
threat
a
unifying
factor
for
aquilonia
that
might
be
used
to
compel
us
into
courses
we
would
not
otherwise
follow
i
mistrust
this
undead
pythonian
of
late
i
have
begun
to
fear
him
followed
him
some
hours
after
he
had
departed
eastward
i
wished
to
learn
what
he
intended
doing
with
conan
i
found
that
he
had
imprisoned
him
in
the
pits
i
intended
to
see
that
the
barbarian
died
in
spite
of
xaltotun
and
i
accomplished
a
cautious
knock
sounded
at
the
door
arideus
grunted
tarascus
him
in
the
saturnine
squire
entered
his
eyes
blazing
with
suppressed
excitement
arideus
exclaimed
tarascus
you
found
the
man
who
attacked
me
did
not
see
him
my
lord
asked
arideus
as
one
who
would
assure
himself
of
a
fact
he
already
knows
to
exist
did
not
recognize
him
it
happened
so
quick
and
the
candle
was
out
all
i
could
think
of
was
that
it
was
some
devil
loosed
on
me
by
xaltotun
magic
pythonian
sleeps
in
his
barred
and
bolted
room
but
i
have
been
in
the
pits
arideus
twitched
his
lean
shoulders
excitedly
speak
man
exclaimed
tarascus
impatiently
did
you
find
there
empty
dungeon
whispered
the
squire
corpse
of
the
great
ape
tarascus
started
upright
and
blood
gushed
from
his
opened
wound
the
is
dead
stabbed
through
the
heart
and
conan
is
gone
tarascus
was
gray
of
face
as
he
mechanically
allowed
orastes
to
force
him
prostrate
again
and
the
priest
renewed
work
upon
his
mangled
flesh
he
repeated
a
crushed
corpse
escaped
mitra
he
is
no
man
but
a
devil
himself
i
thought
xaltotun
was
behind
this
wound
i
see
now
gods
and
devils
it
was
conan
who
stabbed
me
arideus
your
majesty
every
nook
in
the
palace
he
may
be
skulking
through
the
dark
corridors
now
like
a
hungry
tiger
let
no
niche
escape
your
scrutiny
and
beware
it
is
not
a
civilized
man
you
hunt
but
a
barbarian
whose
strength
and
ferocity
are
those
of
a
wild
beast
scour
the
and
the
city
throw
a
cordon
about
the
walls
if
you
find
he
has
escaped
from
the
city
as
he
may
well
do
take
a
troop
of
horsemen
and
follow
him
once
past
the
walls
it
will
be
like
hunting
a
wolf
through
the
hills
but
haste
and
you
may
yet
catch
him
is
a
matter
which
requires
more
than
ordinary
human
wits
said
orastes
we
should
seek
xaltotun
advice
exclaimed
tarascus
violently
the
troopers
pursue
conan
and
slay
him
xaltotun
can
hold
no
grudge
against
us
if
we
kill
a
prisoner
to
prevent
his
escape
said
orastes
am
no
acheronian
but
i
am
versed
in
some
of
the
arts
and
the
control
of
certain
spirits
which
have
cloaked
themselves
in
material
substance
perhaps
i
can
aid
you
in
this
matter
the
fountain
of
thrallos
stood
in
a
clustered
ring
of
oaks
beside
the
road
a
mile
from
the
walls
of
the
city
its
musical
tinkle
reached
conan
ears
through
the
silence
of
the
starlight
he
drank
deep
of
its
icy
stream
and
then
hurried
southward
toward
a
small
dense
thicket
he
saw
there
rounding
it
he
saw
a
great
white
horse
tied
among
the
bushes
heaving
a
deep
gusty
sigh
he
reached
it
with
one
stride
a
mocking
laugh
brought
him
about
glaring
a
dully
glinting
figure
moved
out
of
the
shadows
into
the
starlight
this
was
no
plumed
and
burnished
palace
guardsman
it
was
a
tall
man
in
morion
and
gray
one
of
the
adventurers
a
class
of
warriors
peculiar
to
nemedia
men
who
had
not
attained
to
the
wealth
and
position
of
knighthood
or
had
fallen
from
that
estate
fighters
dedicating
their
lives
to
war
and
adventure
they
constituted
a
class
of
their
own
sometimes
commanding
troops
but
themselves
accountable
to
no
man
but
the
king
conan
knew
that
he
could
have
been
discovered
by
no
more
dangerous
a
foeman
a
quick
glance
among
the
shadows
convinced
him
that
the
man
was
alone
and
he
expanded
his
great
chest
slightly
digging
his
toes
into
the
turf
as
his
thews
coiled
tensely
was
riding
for
belverus
on
amalric
business
said
the
adventurer
advancing
warily
the
starlight
was
a
long
sheen
on
the
great
sword
he
bore
naked
in
his
hand
horse
whinnied
to
mine
from
the
thicket
i
investigated
and
thought
it
strange
a
steed
should
be
tethered
here
i
waited
and
lo
i
have
caught
a
rare
prize
the
adventurers
lived
by
their
swords
know
you
muttered
the
nemedian
are
conan
king
of
aquilonia
i
thought
i
saw
you
die
in
the
valley
of
the
valkia
but
conan
sprang
as
a
dying
tiger
springs
practised
fighter
though
the
adventurer
was
he
did
not
realize
the
desperate
quickness
that
lurks
in
barbaric
sinews
he
was
caught
off
guard
his
heavy
sword
half
lifted
before
he
could
either
strike
or
parry
the
king
poniard
sheathed
itself
in
his
throat
above
the
gorget
slanting
downward
into
his
heart
with
a
choked
gurgle
he
reeled
and
went
down
and
conan
ruthlessly
tore
his
blade
free
as
his
victim
fell
the
white
horse
snorted
violently
and
shied
at
the
sight
and
scent
of
blood
on
the
sword
glaring
down
at
his
lifeless
enemy
dripping
poniard
in
hand
sweat
glistening
on
his
broad
breast
conan
poised
like
a
statue
listening
intently
in
the
woods
about
there
was
no
sound
save
for
the
sleepy
cheep
of
awakened
birds
but
in
the
city
a
mile
away
he
heard
the
strident
blare
of
a
trumpet
hastily
he
bent
over
the
fallen
man
a
few
seconds
search
convinced
him
that
whatever
message
the
man
might
have
borne
was
intended
to
be
conveyed
by
word
of
mouth
but
he
did
not
pause
in
his
task
it
was
not
many
hours
until
dawn
a
few
minutes
later
the
white
horse
was
galloping
westward
along
the
white
road
and
the
rider
wore
the
gray
mail
of
a
nemedian
adventurer
the
rending
of
the
veil
conan
knew
his
only
chance
of
escape
lay
in
speed
he
did
not
even
consider
hiding
somewhere
near
belverus
until
the
chase
passed
on
he
was
certain
that
the
uncanny
ally
of
tarascus
would
be
able
to
ferret
him
out
besides
he
was
not
one
to
skulk
and
hide
an
open
fight
or
an
open
chase
either
suited
his
temperament
better
he
had
a
long
start
he
knew
he
would
lead
them
a
grinding
race
for
the
border
zenobia
had
chosen
well
in
selecting
the
white
horse
his
speed
toughness
and
endurance
were
obvious
the
girl
knew
weapons
and
horses
and
conan
reflected
with
some
satisfaction
she
knew
men
he
rode
westward
at
a
gait
that
ate
up
the
miles
it
was
a
sleeping
land
through
which
he
rode
past
villages
and
villas
amid
spacious
fields
and
orchards
that
grew
sparser
as
he
fared
westward
as
the
villages
thinned
the
land
grew
more
rugged
and
the
keeps
that
frowned
from
eminences
told
of
centuries
of
border
war
but
none
rode
down
from
those
castles
to
challenge
or
halt
him
the
lords
of
the
keeps
were
following
the
banner
of
amalric
the
pennons
that
were
wont
to
wave
over
these
towers
were
now
floating
over
the
aquilonian
plains
when
the
last
huddled
village
fell
behind
him
conan
left
the
road
which
was
beginning
to
bend
toward
the
northwest
toward
the
distant
passes
to
keep
to
the
road
would
mean
to
pass
by
border
towers
still
garrisoned
with
armed
men
who
would
not
allow
him
to
pass
unquestioned
he
knew
there
would
be
no
patrols
riding
the
border
marches
on
either
side
as
in
ordinary
times
but
there
were
those
towers
and
with
dawn
there
would
probably
be
cavalcades
of
returning
soldiers
with
wounded
men
in
this
road
from
belverus
was
the
only
road
that
crossed
the
border
for
fifty
miles
from
north
to
south
it
followed
a
series
of
passes
through
the
hills
and
on
either
hand
lay
a
wide
expanse
of
wild
sparsely
inhabited
mountains
he
maintained
his
due
westerly
direction
intending
to
cross
the
border
deep
in
the
wilds
of
the
hills
that
lay
to
the
south
of
the
passes
it
was
a
shorter
route
more
arduous
but
safer
for
a
hunted
fugitive
one
man
on
a
horse
could
traverse
country
an
army
would
find
impassable
but
at
dawn
he
had
not
reached
the
hills
they
were
a
long
low
blue
rampart
stretching
along
the
horizon
ahead
of
him
here
there
were
neither
farms
nor
villages
no
villas
looming
among
clustering
trees
the
dawn
wind
stirred
the
tall
stiff
grass
and
there
was
nothing
but
the
long
rolling
swells
of
brown
earth
covered
with
dry
grass
and
in
the
distance
the
gaunt
walls
of
a
stronghold
on
a
low
hill
too
many
aquilonian
raiders
had
crossed
the
mountains
in
not
too
distant
days
for
the
countryside
to
be
thickly
settled
as
it
was
farther
to
the
east
dawn
ran
like
a
prairie
fire
across
the
grasslands
and
high
overhead
sounded
a
weird
crying
as
a
straggling
wedge
of
wild
geese
winged
swiftly
southward
in
a
grassy
swale
conan
halted
and
unsaddled
his
mount
its
sides
were
heaving
its
coat
plastered
with
sweat
he
had
pushed
it
unmercifully
through
the
hours
before
dawn
while
it
munched
the
brittle
grass
and
rolled
he
lay
at
the
crest
of
the
low
slope
staring
eastward
far
away
to
the
northward
he
could
see
the
road
he
had
left
streaming
like
a
white
ribbon
over
a
distant
rise
no
black
dots
moved
along
that
glistening
ribbon
there
was
no
sign
about
the
castle
in
the
distance
to
indicate
that
the
keepers
had
noticed
the
lone
wayfarer
an
hour
later
the
land
still
stretched
bare
the
only
sign
of
life
was
a
glint
of
steel
on
the
battlements
a
raven
in
the
sky
that
wheeled
backward
and
forth
dipping
and
rising
as
if
seeking
something
conan
saddled
and
rode
westward
at
a
more
leisurely
gait
as
he
topped
the
farther
crest
of
the
slope
a
raucous
screaming
burst
out
over
his
head
and
looking
up
he
saw
the
raven
flapping
high
above
him
cawing
incessantly
as
he
rode
on
it
followed
him
maintaining
its
position
and
making
the
morning
hideous
with
its
strident
cries
heedless
of
his
efforts
to
drive
it
away
this
kept
up
for
hours
until
conan
teeth
were
on
edge
and
he
felt
that
he
would
give
half
his
kingdom
to
be
allowed
to
wring
that
black
neck
of
hell
he
roared
in
futile
rage
shaking
his
mailed
fist
at
the
frantic
bird
do
you
harry
me
with
your
squawking
begone
you
black
spawn
of
perdition
and
peck
for
wheat
in
the
farmer
fields
he
was
ascending
the
first
pitch
of
the
hills
and
he
seemed
to
hear
an
echo
of
the
bird
clamor
far
behind
him
turning
in
his
saddle
he
presently
made
out
another
black
dot
hanging
in
the
blue
beyond
that
again
he
caught
the
glint
of
the
afternoon
sun
on
steel
that
could
mean
only
one
thing
armed
men
and
they
were
not
riding
along
the
beaten
road
which
was
out
of
his
sight
beyond
the
horizon
they
were
following
him
his
face
grew
grim
and
he
shivered
slightly
as
he
stared
at
the
raven
that
wheeled
high
above
him
it
is
more
than
the
whim
of
a
brainless
beast
he
muttered
riders
can
not
see
you
spawn
of
hell
but
the
other
bird
can
see
you
and
they
can
see
him
you
follow
me
he
follows
you
and
they
follow
him
are
you
only
a
craftily
trained
feathered
creature
or
some
devil
in
the
form
of
a
bird
did
xaltotun
set
you
on
my
trail
are
you
xaltotun
only
a
strident
screech
answered
him
a
screech
vibrating
with
harsh
mockery
conan
wasted
no
more
breath
on
his
dusky
betrayer
grimly
he
settled
to
the
long
grind
of
the
hills
he
dared
not
push
the
horse
too
hard
the
rest
he
had
allowed
it
had
not
been
enough
to
freshen
it
he
was
still
far
ahead
of
his
pursuers
but
they
would
cut
down
that
lead
steadily
it
was
almost
a
certainty
that
their
horses
were
fresher
than
his
for
they
had
undoubtedly
changed
mounts
at
that
castle
he
had
passed
the
going
grew
rougher
the
scenery
more
rugged
steep
grassy
slopes
pitching
up
to
densely
timbered
mountainsides
here
he
knew
he
might
elude
his
hunters
but
for
that
hellish
bird
that
squalled
incessantly
above
him
he
could
no
longer
see
them
in
this
broken
country
but
he
was
certain
that
they
still
followed
him
guided
unerringly
by
their
feathered
allies
that
black
shape
became
like
a
demoniac
incubus
hounding
him
through
measureless
hells
the
stones
he
hurled
with
a
curse
went
wide
or
fell
harmless
though
in
his
youth
he
had
felled
hawks
on
the
wing
the
horse
was
tiring
fast
conan
recognized
the
grim
finality
of
his
position
he
sensed
an
inexorable
driving
fate
behind
all
this
he
could
not
escape
he
was
as
much
a
captive
as
he
had
been
in
the
pits
of
belverus
but
he
was
no
son
of
the
orient
to
yield
passively
to
what
seemed
inevitable
if
he
could
not
escape
he
would
at
least
take
some
of
his
foes
into
eternity
with
him
he
turned
into
a
wide
thicket
of
larches
that
masked
a
slope
looking
for
a
place
to
turn
at
bay
then
ahead
of
him
there
rang
a
strange
shrill
scream
human
yet
weirdly
timbred
an
instant
later
he
had
pushed
through
a
screen
of
branches
and
saw
the
source
of
that
eldritch
cry
in
a
small
glade
below
him
four
soldiers
in
nemedian
were
binding
a
noose
about
the
neck
of
a
gaunt
old
woman
in
peasant
garb
a
heap
of
fagots
bound
with
cord
on
the
ground
near
by
showed
what
her
occupation
had
been
when
surprised
by
these
stragglers
conan
felt
slow
fury
swell
his
heart
as
he
looked
silently
down
and
saw
the
ruffians
dragging
her
toward
a
tree
whose
branches
were
obviously
intended
to
act
as
a
gibbet
he
had
crossed
the
frontier
an
hour
ago
he
was
standing
on
his
own
soil
watching
the
murder
of
one
of
his
own
subjects
the
old
woman
was
struggling
with
surprising
strength
and
energy
and
as
he
watched
she
lifted
her
head
and
voiced
again
the
strange
weird
call
he
had
heard
before
it
was
echoed
as
if
in
mockery
by
the
raven
flapping
above
the
trees
the
soldiers
laughed
roughly
and
one
struck
her
in
the
mouth
conan
swung
from
his
weary
steed
and
dropped
down
the
face
of
the
rocks
landing
with
a
clang
of
mail
on
the
grass
the
four
men
wheeled
at
the
sound
and
drew
their
swords
gaping
at
the
mailed
giant
who
faced
them
sword
in
hand
conan
laughed
harshly
his
eyes
were
bleak
as
flint
he
said
without
passion
and
without
mercy
nemedian
jackals
set
themselves
up
as
executioners
and
hang
my
subjects
at
will
first
you
must
take
the
head
of
their
king
here
i
stand
awaiting
your
lordly
pleasure
the
soldiers
stared
at
him
uncertainly
as
he
strode
toward
them
is
this
madman
growled
a
bearded
ruffian
wears
nemedian
mail
but
speaks
with
an
aquilonian
accent
matter
quoth
another
him
down
and
then
we
hang
the
old
hag
and
so
saying
he
ran
at
conan
lifting
his
sword
but
before
he
could
strike
the
king
great
blade
lashed
down
splitting
helmet
and
skull
the
man
fell
before
him
but
the
others
were
hardy
rogues
they
gave
tongue
like
wolves
and
surged
about
the
lone
figure
in
the
gray
mail
and
the
clamor
and
din
of
steel
drowned
the
cries
of
the
circling
raven
conan
did
not
shout
his
eyes
coals
of
blue
fire
and
his
lips
smiling
bleakly
he
lashed
right
and
left
with
his
sword
for
all
his
size
he
was
quick
as
a
cat
on
his
feet
and
he
was
constantly
in
motion
presenting
a
moving
target
so
that
thrusts
and
swings
cut
empty
air
oftener
than
not
yet
when
he
struck
he
was
perfectly
balanced
and
his
blows
fell
with
devastating
power
three
of
the
four
were
down
dying
in
their
own
blood
and
the
fourth
was
bleeding
from
half
a
dozen
wounds
stumbling
in
headlong
retreat
as
he
parried
frantically
when
spur
caught
in
the
surcoat
of
one
of
the
fallen
men
the
king
stumbled
and
before
he
could
catch
himself
the
nemedian
with
the
frenzy
of
desperation
rushed
him
so
savagely
that
conan
staggered
and
fell
sprawling
over
the
corpse
the
nemedian
croaked
in
triumph
and
sprang
forward
lifting
his
great
sword
with
both
hands
over
his
right
shoulder
as
he
braced
his
legs
wide
for
the
stroke
and
then
over
the
prostrate
king
something
huge
and
hairy
shot
like
a
thunderbolt
full
on
the
soldier
breast
and
his
yelp
of
triumph
changed
to
a
shriek
of
death
conan
scrambling
up
saw
the
man
lying
dead
with
his
throat
torn
out
and
a
great
gray
wolf
stood
over
him
head
sunk
as
it
smelled
the
blood
that
formed
a
pool
on
the
grass
the
king
turned
as
the
old
woman
spoke
to
him
she
stood
straight
and
tall
before
him
and
in
spite
of
her
ragged
garb
her
features
and
aquiline
and
her
keen
black
eyes
were
not
those
of
a
common
peasant
woman
she
called
to
the
wolf
and
it
trotted
to
her
side
like
a
great
dog
and
rubbed
its
giant
shoulder
against
her
knee
while
it
gazed
at
conan
with
great
green
lambent
eyes
absently
she
laid
her
hand
upon
its
mighty
neck
and
so
the
two
stood
regarding
the
king
of
aquilonia
he
found
their
steady
gaze
disquieting
though
there
was
no
hostility
in
it
say
king
conan
died
beneath
the
stones
and
dirt
when
the
cliffs
crumbled
by
valkia
she
said
in
a
deep
strong
resonant
voice
they
say
he
growled
he
was
in
no
mood
for
controversy
and
he
thought
of
those
armored
riders
who
were
pushing
nearer
every
moment
the
raven
above
him
cawed
stridently
and
he
cast
an
involuntary
glare
upward
grinding
his
teeth
in
a
spasm
of
nervous
irritation
up
on
the
ledge
the
white
horse
stood
with
drooping
head
the
old
woman
looked
at
it
and
then
at
the
raven
and
then
she
lifted
a
strange
weird
cry
as
she
had
before
as
if
recognizing
the
call
the
raven
wheeled
suddenly
mute
and
raced
eastward
but
before
it
had
got
out
of
sight
the
shadow
of
mighty
wings
fell
across
it
an
eagle
soared
up
from
the
tangle
of
trees
and
rising
above
it
swooped
and
struck
the
black
messenger
to
the
earth
the
strident
voice
of
betrayal
was
stilled
for
ever
muttered
conan
staring
at
the
old
woman
you
a
magician
too
am
zelata
she
said
people
of
the
valleys
call
me
a
witch
was
that
child
of
the
night
guiding
armed
men
on
your
trail
she
did
not
seem
to
think
the
answer
fantastic
can
not
be
far
behind
me
your
horse
and
follow
me
king
conan
she
said
briefly
without
comment
he
mounted
the
rocks
and
brought
his
horse
down
to
the
glade
by
a
circuitous
path
as
he
came
he
saw
the
eagle
reappear
dropping
lazily
down
from
the
sky
and
rest
an
instant
on
shoulder
spreading
its
great
wings
lightly
so
as
not
to
crush
her
with
its
weight
without
a
word
she
led
the
way
the
great
wolf
trotting
at
her
side
the
eagle
soaring
above
her
through
deep
thickets
and
along
tortuous
ledges
poised
over
deep
ravines
she
led
him
and
finally
along
a
narrow
path
to
a
curious
dwelling
of
stone
half
hut
half
cavern
beneath
a
cliff
hidden
among
the
gorges
and
crags
the
eagle
flew
to
the
pinnacle
of
this
cliff
and
perched
there
like
a
motionless
sentinel
still
silent
zelata
stabled
the
horse
in
a
cave
with
leaves
and
grass
piled
high
for
provender
and
a
tiny
spring
bubbling
in
the
dim
recesses
in
the
hut
she
seated
the
king
on
a
rude
bench
and
she
herself
sat
upon
a
low
stool
before
the
tiny
fireplace
while
she
made
a
fire
of
tamarisk
chunks
and
prepared
a
frugal
meal
the
great
wolf
drowsed
beside
her
facing
the
fire
his
huge
head
sunk
on
his
paws
his
ears
twitching
in
his
dreams
do
not
fear
to
sit
in
the
hut
of
a
witch
she
asked
breaking
her
silence
at
last
an
impatient
shrug
of
his
shoulders
was
her
guest
only
reply
she
gave
into
his
hands
a
wooden
dish
heaped
with
dried
fruits
cheese
and
barley
bread
and
a
great
pot
of
the
heady
upland
beer
brewed
from
barley
grown
in
the
high
valleys
have
found
the
brooding
silence
of
the
glens
more
pleasing
than
the
babble
of
city
streets
she
said
children
of
the
wild
are
kinder
than
the
children
of
men
her
hand
briefly
stroked
the
ruff
of
the
sleeping
wolf
children
were
afar
from
me
today
or
i
had
not
needed
your
sword
my
king
they
were
coming
at
my
call
grudge
had
those
nemedian
dogs
against
you
conan
demanded
from
the
invading
army
straggle
all
over
the
countryside
from
the
frontier
to
tarantia
she
answered
foolish
villagers
in
the
valleys
told
them
that
i
had
a
store
of
gold
hidden
away
so
as
to
divert
their
attentions
from
their
villages
they
demanded
treasure
from
me
and
my
answers
angered
them
but
neither
skulkers
nor
the
men
who
pursue
you
nor
any
raven
will
find
you
here
he
shook
his
head
eating
ravenously
for
tarantia
she
shook
her
head
thrust
your
head
into
the
dragon
jaws
best
seek
refuge
abroad
the
heart
is
gone
from
your
kingdom
do
you
mean
he
demanded
have
been
lost
before
yet
wars
won
a
kingdom
is
not
lost
by
a
single
defeat
you
will
go
to
tarantia
prospero
will
be
holding
it
against
amalric
you
sure
devils
woman
he
exclaimed
wrathfully
else
she
shook
her
head
feel
that
it
is
otherwise
let
us
see
not
lightly
is
the
veil
rent
yet
i
will
rend
it
a
little
and
show
you
your
capital
city
conan
did
not
see
what
she
cast
upon
the
fire
but
the
wolf
whimpered
in
his
dreams
and
a
green
smoke
gathered
and
billowed
up
into
the
hut
and
as
he
watched
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
hut
seemed
to
widen
to
grow
remote
and
vanish
merging
with
infinite
immensities
the
smoke
rolled
about
him
blotting
out
everything
and
in
it
forms
moved
and
faded
and
stood
out
in
startling
clarity
he
stared
at
the
familiar
towers
and
streets
of
tarantia
where
a
mob
seethed
and
screamed
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
somehow
able
to
see
the
banners
of
nemedia
moving
inexorably
westward
through
the
smoke
and
flame
of
a
pillaged
land
in
the
great
square
of
tarantia
the
frantic
throng
milled
and
yammered
screaming
that
the
king
was
dead
that
the
barons
were
girding
themselves
to
divide
the
land
between
them
and
that
the
rule
of
a
king
even
of
valerius
was
better
than
anarchy
prospero
shining
in
his
armor
rode
among
them
trying
to
pacify
them
bidding
them
trust
count
trocero
urging
them
to
man
the
wall
and
aid
his
knights
in
defending
the
city
they
turned
on
him
shrieking
with
fear
and
unreasoning
rage
howling
that
he
was
trocero
butcher
a
more
evil
foe
than
amalric
himself
offal
and
stones
were
hurled
at
his
knights
a
slight
blurring
of
the
picture
that
might
have
denoted
a
passing
of
time
and
then
conan
saw
prospero
and
his
knights
filing
out
of
the
gates
and
spurring
southward
behind
him
the
city
was
in
an
uproar
muttered
conan
thickly
why
could
they
not
trust
prospero
zelata
if
you
are
making
game
of
me
with
some
trickery
has
passed
answered
zelata
imperturbably
though
somberly
was
the
evening
of
the
day
that
has
passed
when
prospero
rode
out
of
tarantia
with
the
hosts
of
amalric
almost
within
sight
from
the
walls
men
saw
the
flame
of
their
pillaging
so
i
read
it
in
the
smoke
at
sunset
the
nemedians
rode
into
tarantia
unopposed
look
even
now
in
the
royal
hall
of
tarantia
abruptly
conan
was
looking
into
the
great
coronation
hall
valerius
stood
on
the
regal
dais
clad
in
ermine
robes
and
amalric
still
in
his
dusty
armor
placed
a
rich
and
gleaming
circlet
on
his
yellow
locks
the
crown
of
aquilonia
the
people
cheered
long
lines
of
nemedian
warriors
looked
grimly
on
and
nobles
long
in
disfavor
at
conan
court
strutted
and
swaggered
with
the
emblem
of
valerius
on
their
sleeves
it
was
an
explosive
imprecation
from
conan
lips
as
he
started
up
his
great
fists
clenched
into
hammers
his
veins
on
his
temples
knotting
his
features
convulsed
nemedian
placing
the
crown
of
aquilonia
on
that
renegade
in
the
royal
hall
of
tarantia
as
if
dispelled
by
his
violence
the
smoke
faded
and
he
saw
black
eyes
gleaming
at
him
through
the
mist
have
seen
the
people
of
your
capital
have
forfeited
the
freedom
you
won
for
them
by
sweat
and
blood
they
have
sold
themselves
to
the
slavers
and
the
butchers
they
have
shown
that
they
do
not
trust
their
destiny
can
you
rely
upon
them
for
the
winning
back
of
your
kingdom
thought
i
was
dead
he
grunted
recovering
some
of
his
poise
have
no
son
men
ca
be
governed
by
a
memory
what
if
the
nemedians
have
taken
tarantia
there
still
remain
the
provinces
the
barons
and
the
people
of
the
countrysides
valerius
has
won
an
empty
glory
are
stubborn
as
befits
a
fighter
i
can
not
show
you
the
future
i
can
not
show
you
all
the
past
nay
show
you
nothing
i
merely
make
you
see
windows
opened
in
the
veil
by
powers
unguessed
would
you
look
into
the
past
for
a
clue
of
the
present
he
seated
himself
abruptly
again
the
green
smoke
rose
and
billowed
again
images
unfolded
before
him
this
time
alien
and
seemingly
irrelevant
he
saw
great
towering
black
walls
pedestals
half
hidden
in
the
shadows
upholding
images
of
hideous
gods
men
moved
in
the
shadows
dark
wiry
men
clad
in
red
silken
loincloths
they
were
bearing
a
green
jade
sarcophagus
along
a
gigantic
black
corridor
but
before
he
could
tell
much
about
what
he
saw
the
scene
shifted
he
saw
a
cavern
dim
shadowy
and
haunted
with
a
strange
intangible
horror
on
an
altar
of
black
stone
stood
a
curious
golden
vessel
shaped
like
the
shell
of
a
scallop
into
this
cavern
came
some
of
the
same
dark
wiry
men
who
had
borne
the
they
seized
the
golden
vessel
and
then
the
shadows
swirled
around
them
and
what
happened
he
could
not
say
but
he
saw
a
glimmer
in
a
whorl
of
darkness
like
a
ball
of
living
fire
then
the
smoke
was
only
smoke
drifting
up
from
the
fire
of
tamarisk
chunks
thinning
and
fading
what
does
this
portend
he
demanded
bewildered
i
saw
in
tarantia
i
can
understand
but
what
means
this
glimpse
of
zamorian
thieves
sneaking
through
a
subterranean
temple
of
set
in
stygia
and
that
cavern
i
never
seen
or
heard
of
anything
like
it
in
all
my
wanderings
if
you
can
show
me
that
much
these
shreds
of
vision
which
mean
nothing
disjointed
why
can
you
not
show
me
all
that
is
to
occur
zelata
stirred
the
fire
without
replying
things
are
governed
by
immutable
laws
she
said
at
last
can
not
make
you
understand
i
do
not
altogether
understand
myself
though
i
have
sought
wisdom
in
the
silences
of
the
high
places
for
more
years
than
i
can
remember
i
can
not
save
you
though
i
would
if
i
might
man
must
at
last
work
out
his
own
salvation
yet
perhaps
wisdom
may
come
to
me
in
dreams
and
in
the
morn
i
may
be
able
to
give
you
the
clue
to
the
enigma
enigma
he
demanded
mystery
that
confronts
you
whereby
you
have
lost
a
kingdom
she
answered
and
then
she
spread
a
sheepskin
upon
the
floor
before
the
hearth
she
said
briefly
without
a
word
he
stretched
himself
upon
it
and
sank
into
restless
but
deep
sleep
through
which
phantoms
moved
silently
and
monstrous
shapeless
shadows
crept
once
limned
against
a
purple
sunless
horizon
he
saw
the
mighty
walls
and
towers
of
a
great
city
such
as
rose
nowhere
on
the
waking
earth
he
knew
its
colossal
pylons
and
purple
minarets
lifted
toward
the
stars
and
over
it
floating
like
a
giant
mirage
hovered
the
bearded
countenance
of
the
man
xaltotun
conan
woke
in
the
chill
whiteness
of
early
dawn
to
see
zelata
crouched
beside
the
tiny
fire
he
had
not
awakened
once
in
the
night
and
the
sound
of
the
great
wolf
leaving
or
entering
should
have
roused
him
yet
the
wolf
was
there
beside
the
hearth
with
its
shaggy
coat
wet
with
dew
and
with
more
than
dew
blood
glistened
wetly
amid
the
thick
fell
and
there
was
a
cut
upon
his
shoulder
zelata
nodded
without
looking
around
as
if
reading
the
thoughts
of
her
royal
guest
has
hunted
before
dawn
and
red
was
the
hunting
i
think
the
man
who
hunted
a
king
will
hunt
no
more
neither
man
nor
beast
conan
stared
at
the
great
beast
with
strange
fascination
as
he
moved
to
take
the
food
zelata
offered
him
i
come
to
my
throne
again
i
wo
forget
he
said
briefly
befriended
me
by
crom
i
ca
remember
when
i
lain
down
and
slept
at
the
mercy
of
man
or
woman
as
i
did
last
night
but
what
of
the
riddle
you
would
read
me
this
morn
a
long
silence
ensued
in
which
the
crackle
of
the
tamarisks
was
loud
on
the
hearth
the
heart
of
your
kingdom
she
said
at
last
lies
your
defeat
and
your
power
you
fight
more
than
mortal
man
you
will
not
press
the
throne
again
unless
you
find
the
heart
of
your
kingdom
you
mean
the
city
of
tarantia
she
shook
her
head
am
but
an
oracle
through
whose
lips
the
gods
speak
my
lips
are
sealed
by
them
lest
i
speak
too
much
you
must
find
the
heart
of
your
kingdom
i
can
say
no
more
my
lips
are
opened
and
sealed
by
the
gods
dawn
was
still
white
on
the
peaks
when
conan
rode
westward
a
glance
back
showed
him
zelata
standing
in
the
door
of
her
hut
inscrutable
as
ever
the
great
wolf
beside
her
a
gray
sky
arched
overhead
and
a
moaning
wind
was
chill
with
a
promise
of
winter
brown
leaves
fluttered
slowly
down
from
the
bare
branches
sifting
upon
his
mailed
shoulders
all
day
he
pushed
through
the
hills
avoiding
roads
and
villages
toward
nightfall
he
began
to
drop
down
from
the
heights
tier
by
tier
and
saw
the
broad
plains
of
aquilonia
spread
out
beneath
him
villages
and
farms
lay
close
to
the
foot
of
the
hills
on
the
western
side
of
the
mountains
for
for
half
a
century
most
of
the
raiding
across
the
frontier
had
been
done
by
the
aquilonians
but
now
only
embers
and
ashes
showed
where
farm
huts
and
villas
had
stood
in
the
gathering
darkness
conan
rode
slowly
on
there
was
little
fear
of
discovery
which
he
dreaded
from
friend
as
well
as
from
foe
the
nemedians
had
remembered
old
scores
on
their
westward
drive
and
valerius
had
made
no
attempt
to
restrain
his
allies
he
did
not
count
on
winning
the
love
of
the
common
people
a
vast
swath
of
desolation
had
been
cut
through
the
country
from
the
foothills
westward
conan
cursed
as
he
rode
over
blackened
expanses
that
had
been
rich
fields
and
saw
the
gaunt
of
burned
houses
jutting
against
the
sky
he
moved
through
an
empty
and
deserted
land
like
a
ghost
out
of
a
forgotten
and
outworn
past
the
speed
with
which
the
army
had
traversed
the
land
showed
what
little
resistance
it
had
encountered
yet
had
conan
been
leading
his
aquilonians
the
invading
army
would
have
been
forced
to
buy
every
foot
they
gained
with
their
blood
the
bitter
realization
permeated
his
soul
he
was
not
the
representative
of
a
dynasty
he
was
only
a
lone
adventurer
even
the
drop
of
dynastic
blood
valerius
boasted
had
more
hold
on
the
minds
of
men
than
the
memory
of
conan
and
the
freedom
and
power
he
had
given
the
kingdom
no
pursuers
followed
him
down
out
of
the
hills
he
watched
for
wandering
or
returning
nemedian
troops
but
met
none
skulkers
gave
him
a
wide
path
supposing
him
to
be
one
of
the
conquerors
what
of
his
harness
groves
and
rivers
were
far
more
plentiful
on
the
western
side
of
the
mountains
and
coverts
for
concealment
were
not
lacking
so
he
moved
across
the
pillaged
land
halting
only
to
rest
his
horse
eating
frugally
of
the
food
zelata
had
given
him
until
on
a
dawn
when
he
lay
hidden
on
a
river
bank
where
willows
and
oaks
grew
thickly
he
glimpsed
afar
across
the
rolling
plains
dotted
with
rich
groves
the
blue
and
golden
towers
of
tarantia
he
was
no
longer
in
a
deserted
land
but
one
teeming
with
varied
life
his
progress
thenceforth
was
slow
and
cautious
through
thick
woods
and
unfrequented
byways
it
was
dusk
when
he
reached
the
plantation
of
servius
galannus
dying
embers
the
countryside
about
tarantia
had
escaped
the
fearful
ravaging
of
the
more
easterly
provinces
there
were
evidences
of
the
march
of
a
conquering
army
in
broken
hedges
plundered
fields
and
looted
granaries
but
torch
and
steel
had
not
been
loosed
wholesale
there
was
but
one
grim
splotch
on
the
landscape
a
charred
expanse
of
ashes
and
blackened
stone
where
conan
knew
had
once
stood
the
stately
villa
of
one
of
his
staunchest
supporters
the
king
dared
not
openly
approach
the
galannus
farm
which
lay
only
a
few
miles
from
the
city
in
the
twilight
he
rode
through
an
extensive
woodland
until
he
sighted
a
keeper
lodge
through
the
trees
dismounting
and
tying
his
horse
he
approached
the
thick
arched
door
with
the
intention
of
sending
the
keeper
after
servius
he
did
not
know
what
enemies
the
manor
house
might
be
sheltering
he
had
seen
no
troops
but
they
might
be
quartered
all
over
the
countryside
but
as
he
drew
near
he
saw
the
door
open
and
a
compact
figure
in
silk
hose
and
richly
embroidered
doublet
stride
forth
and
turn
up
a
path
that
wound
away
through
the
woods
at
the
low
call
the
master
of
the
plantation
wheeled
with
a
startled
exclamation
his
hand
flew
to
the
short
at
his
hip
and
he
recoiled
from
the
tall
gray
steel
figure
standing
in
the
dusk
before
him
are
you
he
demanded
is
your
his
breath
hissed
inward
and
his
ruddy
face
paled
he
ejaculated
have
you
come
back
from
the
gray
lands
of
death
to
terrify
me
i
was
always
your
true
liegeman
in
your
lifetime
i
still
expect
you
to
be
answered
conan
trembling
man
flesh
and
blood
sweating
with
uncertainty
servius
approached
and
stared
into
the
face
of
the
giant
and
then
convinced
of
the
reality
of
what
he
saw
he
dropped
to
one
knee
and
doffed
his
plumed
cap
majesty
truly
this
is
a
miracle
passing
belief
the
great
bell
in
the
citadel
has
tolled
your
dirge
days
agone
men
said
you
died
at
valkia
crushed
under
a
million
tons
of
earth
and
broken
granite
was
another
in
my
harness
grunted
conan
let
us
talk
later
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
joint
of
beef
on
your
board
me
my
lord
cried
servius
springing
to
his
feet
dust
of
travel
is
gray
on
your
mail
and
i
keep
you
standing
here
without
rest
or
sup
mitra
i
see
well
enough
now
that
you
are
alive
but
i
swear
when
i
turned
and
saw
you
standing
all
gray
and
dim
in
the
twilight
the
marrow
of
my
knees
turned
to
water
it
is
an
ill
thing
to
meet
a
man
you
thought
dead
in
the
woodland
at
dusk
the
keeper
see
to
my
steed
which
is
tied
behind
yonder
oak
requested
conan
and
servius
nodded
drawing
the
king
up
the
path
the
patrician
recovering
from
his
supernatural
fright
had
become
extremely
nervous
will
send
a
servant
from
the
manor
he
said
keeper
is
in
his
lodge
but
i
dare
not
trust
even
my
servants
in
these
days
it
is
better
that
only
i
know
of
your
presence
approaching
the
great
house
that
glimmered
dimly
through
the
trees
he
turned
aside
into
a
path
that
ran
between
oaks
whose
intertwining
branches
formed
a
vault
overhead
shutting
out
the
dim
light
of
the
gathering
dusk
servius
hurried
on
through
the
darkness
without
speaking
and
with
something
resembling
panic
in
his
manner
and
presently
led
conan
through
a
small
into
a
narrow
dimly
illuminated
corridor
they
traversed
this
in
haste
and
silence
and
servius
brought
the
king
into
a
spacious
chamber
with
a
high
ceiling
and
richly
paneled
walls
logs
flamed
in
the
wide
fireplace
for
there
was
a
frosty
edge
to
the
air
and
a
great
meat
pasty
in
a
stone
platter
stood
smoking
on
a
broad
mahogany
board
servius
locked
the
massive
door
and
extinguished
the
candles
that
stood
in
a
silver
candlestick
on
the
table
leaving
the
chamber
illuminated
only
by
the
fire
on
the
hearth
pardon
your
majesty
he
apologized
are
perilous
times
spies
lurk
everywhere
it
were
better
that
none
be
able
to
peer
through
the
windows
and
recognize
you
this
pasty
however
is
just
from
the
oven
as
i
intended
supping
on
my
return
from
talk
with
my
keeper
if
your
majesty
would
deign
light
is
sufficient
grunted
conan
seating
himself
with
scant
ceremony
and
drawing
his
poniard
he
dug
ravenously
into
the
luscious
dish
and
washed
it
down
with
great
gulps
of
wine
from
grapes
grown
in
servius
vineyards
he
seemed
oblivious
to
any
sense
of
peril
but
servius
shifted
uneasily
on
his
settle
by
the
fire
nervously
fingering
the
heavy
gold
chain
about
his
neck
he
glanced
continually
at
the
of
the
casement
gleaming
dimly
in
the
firelight
and
cocked
his
ear
toward
the
door
as
if
half
expecting
to
hear
the
pad
of
furtive
feet
in
the
corridor
without
finishing
his
meal
conan
rose
and
seated
himself
on
another
settle
before
the
fire
wo
jeopardize
you
long
by
my
presence
servius
he
said
abruptly
will
find
me
far
from
your
plantation
lord
servius
lifted
his
hands
in
expostulation
but
conan
waved
his
protests
aside
know
your
loyalty
and
your
courage
both
are
above
reproach
but
if
valerius
has
usurped
my
throne
it
would
be
death
for
you
to
shelter
me
if
you
were
discovered
am
not
strong
enough
to
defy
him
openly
admitted
servius
fifty
i
could
lead
to
battle
would
be
but
a
handful
of
straws
you
saw
the
ruins
of
emilius
scavonus
plantation
conan
nodded
frowning
darkly
was
the
strongest
patrician
in
this
province
as
you
know
he
refused
to
give
his
allegiance
to
valerius
the
nemedians
burned
him
in
the
ruins
of
his
own
villa
after
that
the
rest
of
us
saw
the
futility
of
resistance
especially
as
the
people
of
tarantia
refused
to
fight
we
submitted
and
valerius
spared
our
lives
though
he
levied
a
tax
upon
us
that
will
ruin
many
but
what
could
we
do
we
thought
you
were
dead
many
of
the
barons
had
been
slain
others
taken
prisoner
the
army
was
shattered
and
scattered
you
have
no
heir
to
take
the
crown
there
was
no
one
to
lead
us
there
not
count
trocero
of
poitain
demanded
conan
harshly
servius
spread
his
hands
helplessly
is
true
that
his
general
prospero
was
in
the
field
with
a
small
army
retreating
before
amalric
he
urged
men
to
rally
to
his
banner
but
with
your
majesty
dead
men
remembered
old
wars
and
civil
brawls
and
how
trocero
and
his
poitanians
once
rode
through
these
provinces
even
as
amalric
was
riding
now
with
torch
and
sword
the
barons
were
jealous
of
trocero
some
men
spies
of
valerius
perhaps
shouted
that
the
count
of
poitain
intended
seizing
the
crown
for
himself
old
sectional
hates
flared
up
again
if
we
had
had
one
man
with
dynastic
blood
in
his
veins
we
would
have
crowned
and
followed
him
against
nemedia
but
we
had
none
barons
who
followed
you
loyally
would
not
follow
one
of
their
own
number
each
holding
himself
as
good
as
his
neighbor
each
fearing
the
ambitions
of
the
others
you
were
the
cord
that
held
the
fagots
together
when
the
cord
was
cut
the
fagots
fell
apart
if
you
had
had
a
son
the
barons
would
have
rallied
loyally
to
him
but
there
was
no
point
for
their
patriotism
to
focus
upon
merchants
and
commoners
dreading
anarchy
and
a
return
of
feudal
days
when
each
baron
was
his
own
law
cried
out
that
any
king
was
better
than
none
even
valerius
who
was
at
least
of
the
blood
of
the
old
dynasty
there
was
no
one
to
oppose
him
when
he
rode
up
at
the
head
of
his
hosts
with
the
scarlet
dragon
of
nemedia
floating
over
him
and
rang
his
lance
against
the
gates
of
tarantia
the
people
threw
open
the
gates
and
knelt
in
the
dust
before
him
they
had
refused
to
aid
prospero
in
holding
the
city
they
said
they
had
rather
be
ruled
by
valerius
than
by
trocero
they
said
truthfully
that
the
barons
would
not
rally
to
trocero
but
that
many
would
accept
valerius
they
said
that
by
yielding
to
valerius
they
would
escape
the
devastation
of
civil
war
and
the
fury
of
the
nemedians
prospero
rode
southward
with
his
ten
thousand
knights
and
the
horsemen
of
the
nemedians
entered
the
city
a
few
hours
later
they
did
not
follow
him
they
remained
to
see
that
valerius
was
crowned
in
tarantia
the
old
witch
smoke
showed
the
truth
muttered
conan
feeling
a
queer
chill
along
his
spine
crowned
valerius
in
the
coronation
hall
with
the
blood
of
slaughter
scarcely
dried
on
his
hands
do
the
people
thrive
under
his
benevolent
rule
asked
conan
with
angry
irony
lives
like
a
foreign
prince
in
the
midst
of
a
conquered
land
answered
servius
bitterly
court
is
filled
with
nemedians
the
palace
troops
are
of
the
same
breed
and
a
large
garrison
of
them
occupy
the
citadel
aye
the
hour
of
the
dragon
has
come
at
last
swagger
like
lords
through
the
streets
women
are
outraged
and
merchants
plundered
daily
and
valerius
either
can
or
will
make
no
attempt
to
curb
them
nay
he
is
but
their
puppet
their
figurehead
men
of
sense
knew
he
would
be
and
the
people
are
beginning
to
find
it
out
has
ridden
forth
with
a
strong
army
to
reduce
the
outlying
provinces
where
some
of
the
barons
have
defied
him
but
there
is
no
unity
among
them
their
jealousy
of
each
other
is
stronger
than
their
fear
of
amalric
he
will
crush
them
one
by
one
many
castles
and
cities
realizing
that
have
sent
in
their
submission
those
who
resist
fare
miserably
the
nemedians
are
glutting
their
long
hatred
and
their
ranks
are
swelled
by
aquilonians
whom
fear
gold
or
necessity
of
occupation
are
forcing
into
their
armies
it
is
a
natural
consequence
conan
nodded
somberly
staring
at
the
red
reflections
of
the
firelight
on
the
richly
carved
oaken
panels
has
a
king
instead
of
the
anarchy
they
feared
said
servius
at
last
does
not
protect
his
subjects
against
his
allies
hundreds
who
could
not
pay
the
ransom
imposed
upon
them
have
been
sold
to
the
kothic
conan
head
jerked
up
and
a
lethal
flame
lit
his
blue
eyes
he
swore
gustily
his
mighty
hands
knotting
into
iron
hammers
white
men
sell
white
men
and
white
women
as
it
was
in
the
feudal
days
in
the
palaces
of
shem
and
of
turan
they
will
live
out
the
lives
of
slaves
valerius
is
king
but
the
unity
for
which
the
people
looked
even
though
of
the
sword
is
not
complete
in
the
north
and
poitain
in
the
south
are
yet
unconquered
and
there
are
unsubdued
provinces
in
the
west
where
the
border
barons
have
the
backing
of
the
bossonian
bowmen
yet
these
outlying
provinces
are
no
real
menace
to
valerius
they
must
remain
on
the
defensive
and
will
be
lucky
if
they
are
able
to
keep
their
independence
here
valerius
and
his
foreign
knights
are
supreme
him
make
the
best
of
it
then
said
conan
grimly
time
is
short
the
people
will
rise
when
they
learn
that
i
alive
we
take
tarantia
back
before
amalric
can
return
with
his
army
then
we
sweep
these
dogs
from
the
kingdom
servius
was
silent
the
crackle
of
the
fire
was
loud
in
the
stillness
exclaimed
conan
impatiently
do
you
sit
with
your
head
bent
staring
at
the
hearth
do
you
doubt
what
i
have
said
servius
avoided
the
king
eye
mortal
man
can
do
you
will
do
your
majesty
he
answered
have
ridden
behind
you
in
battle
and
i
know
that
no
mortal
being
can
stand
before
your
sword
then
servius
drew
his
jupon
closer
about
him
and
shivered
in
spite
of
the
flame
say
your
fall
was
occasioned
by
sorcery
he
said
presently
then
mortal
can
fight
against
sorcery
who
is
this
veiled
man
who
communes
at
midnight
with
valerius
and
his
allies
as
men
say
who
appears
and
disappears
so
mysteriously
men
say
in
whispers
that
he
is
a
great
magician
who
died
thousands
of
years
ago
but
has
returned
from
death
gray
lands
to
overthrow
the
king
of
aquilonia
and
restore
the
dynasty
of
which
valerius
is
heir
matter
exclaimed
conan
angrily
escaped
from
the
pits
of
belverus
and
from
diabolism
in
the
mountains
if
the
people
rise
servius
shook
his
head
staunchest
supporters
in
the
eastern
and
central
provinces
are
dead
fled
or
imprisoned
gunderland
is
far
to
the
north
poitain
far
to
the
south
the
bossonians
have
retired
to
their
marches
far
to
the
west
it
would
take
weeks
to
gather
and
concentrate
these
forces
and
before
that
could
be
done
each
levy
would
be
attacked
separately
by
amalric
and
destroyed
an
uprising
in
the
central
provinces
would
tip
the
scales
for
us
exclaimed
conan
could
seize
tarantia
and
hold
it
against
amalric
until
the
gundermen
and
poitanians
could
get
here
servius
hesitated
and
his
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
say
you
died
accursed
men
say
this
veiled
stranger
cast
a
spell
upon
you
to
slay
you
and
break
your
army
the
great
bell
has
tolled
your
dirge
men
believe
you
to
be
dead
and
the
central
provinces
would
not
rise
even
if
they
knew
you
lived
they
would
not
dare
sorcery
defeated
you
at
valkia
sorcery
brought
the
news
to
tarantia
for
that
very
night
men
were
shouting
of
it
in
the
streets
nemedian
priest
loosed
black
magic
again
in
the
streets
of
tarantia
to
slay
men
who
still
were
loyal
to
your
memory
i
myself
saw
it
armed
men
dropped
like
flies
and
died
in
the
streets
in
a
manner
no
man
could
understand
and
the
lean
priest
laughed
and
said
am
only
altaro
only
an
acolyte
of
orastes
who
is
but
an
acolyte
of
him
who
wears
the
veil
not
mine
is
the
power
the
power
but
works
through
me
said
conan
harshly
it
not
better
to
die
honorably
than
to
live
in
infamy
is
death
worse
than
oppression
slavery
and
ultimate
destruction
the
fear
of
sorcery
is
in
reason
is
out
replied
servius
fear
of
the
central
provinces
is
too
great
to
allow
them
to
rise
for
you
the
outlying
provinces
would
fight
for
you
but
the
same
sorcery
that
smote
your
army
at
valkia
would
smite
you
again
the
nemedians
hold
the
broadest
richest
and
most
thickly
populated
sections
of
aquilonia
and
they
can
not
be
defeated
by
the
forces
which
might
still
be
at
your
command
you
would
be
sacrificing
your
loyal
subjects
uselessly
in
sorrow
i
say
it
but
it
is
true
king
conan
you
are
a
king
without
a
kingdom
conan
stared
into
the
fire
without
replying
a
smoldering
log
crashed
down
among
the
flames
without
a
bursting
shower
of
sparks
it
might
have
been
the
crashing
ruin
of
his
kingdom
again
conan
felt
the
presence
of
a
grim
reality
behind
the
veil
of
material
illusion
he
sensed
again
the
inexorable
drive
of
a
ruthless
fate
a
feeling
of
furious
panic
tugged
at
his
soul
a
sense
of
being
trapped
and
a
red
rage
that
burned
to
destroy
and
kill
are
the
officials
of
my
court
he
demanded
at
last
was
sorely
wounded
at
valkia
was
ransomed
by
his
family
and
now
lies
in
his
castle
in
attalus
he
will
be
fortunate
if
he
ever
rides
again

the

fled
the
kingdom
in
disguise
no
man
knows
whither
the
council
has
been
disbanded
some
were
imprisoned
some
banished
many
of
your
loyal
subjects
have
been
put
to
death
tonight
for
instance
the
countess
albiona
dies
under
the
headsman
ax
conan
started
and
stared
at
servius
with
such
anger
smoldering
in
his
blue
eyes
that
the
patrician
shrank
back
she
would
not
become
the
mistress
of
valerius
her
lands
are
forfeit
her
henchmen
sold
into
slavery
and
at
midnight
in
the
iron
tower
her
head
must
fall
be
advised
my
king
to
me
you
will
ever
be
my
king
and
flee
before
you
are
discovered
in
these
days
none
is
safe
spies
and
informers
creep
among
us
betraying
the
slightest
deed
or
word
of
discontent
as
treason
and
rebellion
if
you
make
yourself
known
to
your
subjects
it
will
only
end
in
your
capture
and
death
horses
and
all
the
men
that
i
can
trust
are
at
your
disposal
before
dawn
we
can
be
far
from
tarantia
and
well
on
our
way
toward
the
border
if
i
can
not
aid
you
to
recover
your
kingdom
i
can
at
least
follow
you
into
exile
conan
shook
his
head
servius
glanced
uneasily
at
him
as
he
sat
staring
into
the
fire
his
chin
propped
on
his
mighty
fist
the
firelight
gleamed
redly
on
his
steel
mail
on
his
baleful
eyes
they
burned
in
the
firelight
like
the
eyes
of
a
wolf
servius
was
again
aware
as
in
the
past
and
now
more
strongly
than
ever
of
something
alien
about
the
king
that
great
frame
under
the
mail
mesh
was
too
hard
and
supple
for
a
civilized
man
the
elemental
fire
of
the
primitive
burned
in
those
smoldering
eyes
now
the
barbaric
suggestion
about
the
king
was
more
pronounced
as
if
in
his
extremity
the
outward
aspects
of
civilization
were
stripped
away
to
reveal
the
primordial
core
conan
was
reverting
to
his
pristine
type
he
did
not
act
as
a
civilized
man
would
act
under
the
same
conditions
nor
did
his
thoughts
run
in
the
same
channels
he
was
unpredictable
it
was
only
a
stride
from
the
king
of
aquilonia
to
the
slayer
of
the
cimmerian
hills
ride
to
poitain
if
it
may
be
conan
said
at
last
i
ride
alone
and
i
have
one
last
duty
to
perform
as
king
of
aquilonia
do
you
mean
your
majesty
asked
servius
shaken
by
a
premonition
going
into
tarantia
after
albiona
tonight
answered
the
king
failed
all
my
other
loyal
subjects
it
seems
if
they
take
her
head
they
can
have
mine
too
is
madness
cried
servius
staggering
up
and
clutching
his
throat
as
if
he
already
felt
the
noose
closing
about
it
are
secrets
to
the
tower
which
few
know
said
conan
i
be
a
dog
to
leave
albiona
to
die
because
of
her
loyalty
to
me
i
may
be
a
king
without
a
kingdom
but
i
not
a
man
without
honor
will
ruin
us
all
whispered
servius
will
ruin
no
one
but
me
if
i
fail
you
risked
enough
i
ride
alone
tonight
this
is
all
i
want
you
to
do
procure
me
a
patch
for
my
eye
a
staff
for
my
hand
and
garments
such
as
travelers
wear
is
the
king
or
his
ghost
many
men
passed
through
the
great
arched
gates
of
tarantia
between
sunset
and
midnight
belated
travelers
merchants
from
afar
with
heavily
laden
mules
free
workmen
from
the
surrounding
farms
and
vineyards
now
that
valerius
was
supreme
in
the
central
provinces
there
was
no
rigid
scrutiny
of
the
folk
who
flowed
in
a
steady
stream
through
the
wide
gates
discipline
had
been
relaxed
the
nemedian
soldiers
who
stood
on
guard
were
half
drunk
and
much
too
busy
watching
for
handsome
peasant
girls
and
rich
merchants
who
could
be
bullied
to
notice
workmen
or
dusty
travelers
even
one
tall
wayfarer
whose
worn
cloak
could
not
conceal
the
hard
lines
of
his
powerful
frame
this
man
carried
himself
with
an
erect
aggressive
bearing
that
was
too
natural
for
him
to
realize
it
himself
much
less
dissemble
it
a
great
patch
covered
one
eye
and
his
leather
coif
drawn
low
over
his
brows
shadowed
his
features
with
a
long
thick
staff
in
his
muscular
brown
hand
he
strode
leisurely
through
the
arch
where
the
torches
flared
and
guttered
and
ignored
by
the
tipsy
guardsmen
emerged
upon
the
wide
streets
of
tarantia
upon
these
thoroughfares
the
usual
throngs
went
about
their
business
and
shops
and
stalls
stood
open
with
their
wares
displayed
one
thread
ran
a
constant
theme
through
the
pattern
nemedian
soldiers
singly
or
in
clumps
swaggered
through
the
throngs
shouldering
their
way
with
studied
arrogance
women
scurried
from
their
path
and
men
stepped
aside
with
darkened
brows
and
clenched
fists
the
aquilonians
were
a
proud
race
and
these
were
their
hereditary
enemies
the
knuckles
of
the
tall
traveler
knotted
on
his
staff
but
like
the
others
he
stepped
aside
to
let
the
men
in
armor
have
the
way
among
the
motley
and
varied
crowd
he
did
not
attract
much
attention
in
his
drab
dusty
garments
but
once
as
he
passed
a
stall
and
the
light
that
streamed
from
its
wide
door
fell
full
upon
him
he
thought
he
felt
an
intense
stare
upon
him
and
turning
quickly
saw
a
man
in
the
brown
jerkin
of
a
free
workman
regarding
him
fixedly
this
man
turned
away
with
undue
haste
and
vanished
in
the
shifting
throng
but
conan
turned
into
a
narrow
and
quickened
his
pace
it
might
have
been
mere
idle
curiosity
but
he
could
take
no
chances
the
grim
iron
tower
stood
apart
from
the
citadel
amid
a
maze
of
narrow
streets
and
crowding
houses
where
the
meaner
structures
appropriating
a
space
from
which
the
more
fastidious
shrank
had
invaded
a
portion
of
the
city
ordinarily
alien
to
them
the
tower
was
in
reality
a
castle
an
ancient
formidable
pile
of
heavy
stone
and
black
iron
which
had
itself
served
as
the
citadel
in
an
earlier
ruder
century
not
a
long
distance
from
it
lost
in
a
tangle
of
partly
deserted
tenements
and
warehouses
stood
an
ancient
watchtower
so
old
and
forgotten
that
it
did
not
appear
on
the
maps
of
the
city
for
a
hundred
years
back
its
original
purpose
had
been
forgotten
and
nobody
of
such
as
saw
it
at
all
noticed
that
the
apparently
ancient
lock
which
kept
it
from
being
appropriated
as
by
beggars
and
thieves
was
in
reality
comparatively
new
and
extremely
powerful
cunningly
disguised
into
an
appearance
of
rusty
antiquity
not
half
a
dozen
men
in
the
kingdom
had
ever
known
the
secret
of
that
tower
no
keyhole
showed
in
the
massive
lock
but
practised
fingers
stealing
over
it
pressed
here
and
there
knobs
invisible
to
the
casual
eye
the
door
silently
opened
inward
and
he
entered
solid
blackness
pushing
the
door
shut
behind
him
a
light
would
have
showed
the
tower
empty
a
bare
cylindrical
shaft
of
massive
stone
groping
in
a
corner
with
the
sureness
of
familiarity
he
found
the
projections
for
which
he
was
feeling
on
a
slab
of
the
stone
that
composed
the
floor
quickly
he
lifted
it
and
without
hesitation
lowered
himself
into
the
aperture
beneath
his
feet
felt
stone
steps
leading
downward
into
what
he
knew
was
a
narrow
tunnel
that
ran
straight
toward
the
foundations
of
the
iron
tower
three
streets
away
the
bell
on
the
citadel
which
tolled
only
at
the
midnight
hour
or
for
the
death
of
a
king
boomed
suddenly
in
a
dimly
lighted
chamber
in
the
iron
tower
a
door
opened
and
a
form
emerged
into
a
corridor
the
interior
of
the
tower
was
as
forbidding
as
its
external
appearance
its
massive
stone
walls
were
rough
unadorned
the
flags
of
the
floor
were
worn
deep
by
generations
of
faltering
feet
and
the
vault
of
the
ceiling
was
gloomy
in
the
dim
light
of
torches
set
in
niches
the
man
who
trudged
down
that
grim
corridor
was
in
appearance
in
keeping
with
his
surroundings
he
was
a
tall
powerfully
built
man
clad
in
black
silk
over
his
head
was
drawn
a
black
hood
which
fell
about
his
shoulders
having
two
holes
for
his
eyes
from
his
shoulders
hung
a
loose
black
cloak
and
over
one
shoulder
he
bore
a
heavy
ax
the
shape
of
which
was
that
of
neither
tool
nor
weapon
as
he
went
down
the
corridor
a
figure
came
hobbling
up
it
a
bent
surly
old
man
stooping
under
the
weight
of
his
pike
and
a
lantern
he
bore
in
one
hand
are
not
as
prompt
as
your
predecessor
master
headsman
he
grumbled
has
just
struck
and
masked
men
have
gone
to
milady
cell
they
await
you
tones
of
the
bell
still
echo
among
the
towers
answered
the
executioner
i
am
not
so
quick
to
leap
and
run
at
the
beck
of
aquilonians
as
was
the
dog
who
held
this
office
before
me
they
shall
find
my
arm
no
less
ready
get
you
to
your
duties
old
watchman
and
leave
me
to
mine
i
think
mine
is
the
sweeter
trade
by
mitra
for
you
tramp
cold
corridors
and
peer
at
rusty
dungeon
doors
while
i
lop
off
the
fairest
head
in
tarantia
this
night
the
watchman
limped
on
down
the
corridor
still
grumbling
and
the
headsman
resumed
his
leisurely
way
a
few
strides
carried
him
around
a
turn
in
the
corridor
and
he
absently
noted
that
at
his
left
a
door
stood
partly
open
if
he
had
thought
he
would
have
known
that
that
door
had
been
opened
since
the
watchman
passed
but
thinking
was
not
his
trade
he
was
passing
the
unlocked
door
before
he
realized
that
aught
was
amiss
and
then
it
was
too
late
a
soft
tigerish
step
and
the
rustle
of
a
cloak
warned
him
but
before
he
could
turn
a
heavy
arm
hooked
about
his
throat
from
behind
crushing
the
cry
before
it
could
reach
his
lips
in
the
brief
instant
that
was
allowed
him
he
realized
with
a
surge
of
panic
the
strength
of
his
attacker
against
which
his
own
brawny
thews
were
helpless
he
sensed
without
seeing
the
poised
dagger
dog
muttered
a
voice
thick
with
passion
in
his
ear
cut
off
your
last
aquilonian
head
and
that
was
the
last
thing
he
ever
heard
in
a
dank
dungeon
lighted
only
by
a
guttering
torch
three
men
stood
about
a
young
woman
who
knelt
on
the
flags
staring
wildly
up
at
them
she
was
clad
only
in
a
scanty
shift
her
golden
hair
fell
in
lustrous
ripples
about
her
white
shoulders
and
her
wrists
were
bound
behind
her
even
in
the
uncertain
torchlight
and
in
spite
of
her
disheveled
condition
and
pallor
of
fear
her
beauty
was
striking
she
knelt
mutely
staring
with
wide
eyes
up
at
her
tormenters
the
men
were
closely
masked
and
cloaked
such
a
deed
as
this
needed
masks
even
in
a
conquered
land
she
knew
them
all
nevertheless
but
what
she
knew
would
harm
no
one
after
that
night
merciful
sovereign
offers
you
one
more
chance
countess
said
the
tallest
of
the
three
and
he
spoke
aquilonian
without
an
accent
bids
me
say
that
if
you
soften
your
proud
rebellious
spirit
he
will
still
open
his
arms
to
you
if
not
he
gestured
toward
a
grim
wooden
block
in
the
center
of
the
cell
it
was
blackly
stained
and
showed
many
deep
nicks
as
if
a
keen
edge
cutting
through
some
yielding
substance
had
sunk
into
the
wood
albiona
shuddered
and
turned
pale
shrinking
back
every
fiber
in
her
vigorous
young
body
quivered
with
the
urge
of
life
valerius
was
young
too
and
handsome
many
women
loved
him
she
told
herself
fighting
with
herself
for
life
but
she
could
not
speak
the
word
that
would
ransom
her
soft
young
body
from
the
block
and
the
dripping
ax
she
could
not
reason
the
matter
she
only
knew
that
when
she
thought
of
the
clasp
of
valerius
arms
her
flesh
crawled
with
an
abhorrence
greater
than
the
fear
of
death
she
shook
her
head
helplessly
compelled
by
an
impulsion
more
irresistible
than
the
instinct
to
live
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
exclaimed
one
of
the
others
impatiently
and
he
spoke
with
a
nemedian
accent
is
the
headsman
as
if
summoned
by
the
word
the
dungeon
door
opened
silently
and
a
great
figure
stood
framed
in
it
like
a
black
shadow
from
the
underworld
albiona
voiced
a
low
involuntary
cry
at
the
sight
of
that
grim
shape
and
the
others
stared
silently
for
a
moment
perhaps
themselves
daunted
with
superstitious
awe
at
the
silent
hooded
figure
through
the
coif
the
eyes
blazed
like
coals
of
blue
fire
and
as
these
eyes
rested
on
each
man
in
turn
he
felt
a
curious
chill
travel
down
his
spine
then
the
tall
aquilonian
roughly
seized
the
girl
and
dragged
her
to
the
block
she
screamed
uncontrollably
and
fought
hopelessly
against
him
frantic
with
terror
but
he
ruthlessly
forced
her
to
her
knees
and
bent
her
yellow
head
down
to
the
bloody
block
do
you
delay
headsman
he
exclaimed
angrily
your
task
he
was
answered
by
a
short
gusty
boom
of
laughter
that
was
indescribably
menacing
all
in
the
dungeon
froze
in
their
places
staring
at
the
hooded
shape
the
two
cloaked
figures
the
masked
man
bending
over
the
girl
the
girl
herself
on
her
knees
twisting
her
imprisoned
head
to
look
upward
means
this
unseemly
mirth
dog
demanded
the
aquilonian
uneasily
the
man
in
the
black
garb
tore
his
hood
from
his
head
and
flung
it
to
the
ground
he
set
his
back
to
the
closed
door
and
lifted
the
ax
you
know
me
dogs
he
rumbled
you
know
me
the
breathless
silence
was
broken
by
a
scream
king
shrieked
albiona
wrenching
herself
free
from
the
slackened
grasp
of
her
captor
mitra
the
king
the
three
men
stood
like
statues
and
then
the
aquilonian
started
and
spoke
like
a
man
who
doubts
his
own
senses
he
ejaculated
is
the
king
or
his
ghost
what
devil
work
is
this
work
to
match
devils
mocked
conan
his
lips
laughing
but
hell
flaming
in
his
eyes
fall
to
my
gentlemen
you
have
your
swords
and
i
this
cleaver
nay
i
think
this
butcher
tool
fits
the
work
at
hand
my
fair
lords
him
muttered
the
aquilonian
drawing
his
sword
is
conan
and
we
must
kill
or
be
killed
and
like
men
waking
from
a
trance
the
nemedians
drew
their
blades
and
rushed
on
the
king
the
headsman
ax
was
not
made
for
such
work
but
the
king
wielded
the
heavy
clumsy
weapon
as
lightly
as
a
hatchet
and
his
quickness
of
foot
as
he
constantly
shifted
his
position
defeated
their
purpose
of
engaging
him
all
three
at
once
he
caught
the
sword
of
the
first
man
on
his
and
crushed
in
the
wielder
breast
with
a
murderous
counterstroke
before
he
could
step
back
or
parry
the
remaining
nemedian
missing
a
savage
swipe
had
his
brains
dashed
out
before
he
could
recover
his
balance
and
an
instant
later
the
aquilonian
was
backed
into
a
corner
desperately
parrying
the
crashing
strokes
that
rained
about
him
lacking
opportunity
even
to
scream
for
help
suddenly
conan
long
left
arm
shot
out
and
ripped
the
mask
from
the
man
head
disclosing
the
pallid
features
grated
the
king
thought
i
knew
you
traitor
damned
renegade
even
this
base
steel
is
too
honorable
for
your
foul
head
nay
die
as
thieves
die
the
ax
fell
in
a
devastating
arch
and
the
aquilonian
cried
out
and
went
to
his
knees
grasping
the
severed
stump
of
his
right
arm
from
which
blood
spouted
it
had
been
shorn
away
at
the
elbow
and
the
ax
unchecked
in
its
descent
had
gashed
deeply
into
his
side
so
that
his
entrails
bulged
out
there
and
bleed
to
death
grunted
conan
casting
the
ax
away
disgustedly
countess
stooping
he
slashed
the
cords
that
bound
her
wrists
and
lifting
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
strode
from
the
dungeon
she
was
sobbing
hysterically
with
her
arms
thrown
about
his
corded
neck
in
a
frenzied
embrace
all
he
muttered
not
out
of
this
yet
if
we
can
reach
the
dungeon
where
the
secret
door
opens
on
stairs
that
lead
to
the
tunnel
devil
take
it
they
heard
that
noise
even
through
these
walls
down
the
corridor
arms
clanged
and
the
tramp
and
shouting
of
men
echoed
under
the
vaulted
roof
a
bent
figure
came
hobbling
swiftly
along
lantern
held
high
and
its
light
shone
full
on
conan
and
the
girl
with
a
curse
the
cimmerian
sprang
toward
him
but
the
old
watchman
abandoning
both
lantern
and
pike
scuttled
away
down
the
corridor
screeching
for
help
at
the
top
of
his
cracked
voice
deeper
shouts
answered
him
conan
turned
swiftly
and
ran
the
other
way
he
was
cut
off
from
the
dungeon
with
the
secret
lock
and
the
hidden
door
through
which
he
had
entered
the
tower
and
by
which
he
had
hoped
to
leave
but
he
knew
this
grim
building
well
before
he
was
king
he
had
been
imprisoned
in
it
he
turned
off
into
a
side
passage
and
quickly
emerged
into
another
broader
corridor
which
ran
parallel
to
the
one
down
which
he
had
come
and
which
was
at
the
moment
deserted
he
followed
this
only
a
few
yards
when
he
again
turned
back
down
another
side
passage
this
brought
him
back
into
the
corridor
he
had
left
but
at
a
strategic
point
a
few
feet
farther
up
the
corridor
there
was
a
heavy
bolted
door
and
before
it
stood
a
bearded
nemedian
in
corselet
and
helmet
his
back
to
conan
as
he
peered
up
the
corridor
in
the
direction
of
the
growing
tumult
and
wildly
waving
lanterns
conan
did
not
hesitate
slipping
the
girl
to
the
ground
he
ran
at
the
guard
swiftly
and
silently
sword
in
hand
the
man
turned
just
as
the
king
reached
him
bawled
in
surprise
and
fright
and
lifted
his
pike
but
before
he
could
bring
the
clumsy
weapon
into
play
conan
brought
down
his
sword
on
the
fellow
helmet
with
a
force
that
would
have
felled
an
ox
helmet
and
skull
gave
way
together
and
the
guard
crumpled
to
the
floor
in
an
instant
conan
had
drawn
the
massive
bolt
that
barred
the
door
too
heavy
for
one
ordinary
man
to
have
manipulated
and
called
hastily
to
albiona
who
ran
staggering
to
him
catching
her
up
unceremoniously
with
one
arm
he
bore
her
through
the
door
and
into
the
outer
darkness
they
had
come
into
a
narrow
alley
black
as
pitch
walled
by
the
side
of
the
tower
on
one
hand
and
the
sheer
stone
back
of
a
row
of
buildings
on
the
other
conan
hurrying
through
the
darkness
as
swiftly
as
he
dared
felt
the
latter
wall
for
doors
or
windows
but
found
none
the
great
door
clanged
open
behind
them
and
men
poured
out
with
torches
gleaming
on
and
naked
swords
they
glared
about
bellowing
unable
to
penetrate
the
darkness
which
their
torches
served
to
illuminate
for
only
a
few
feet
in
any
direction
and
then
rushed
down
the
alley
at
random
heading
in
the
direction
opposite
to
that
taken
by
conan
and
albiona
learn
their
mistake
quick
enough
he
muttered
increasing
his
pace
we
ever
find
a
crack
in
this
infernal
wall
damn
the
street
watch
ahead
of
them
a
faint
glow
became
apparent
where
the
alley
opened
into
a
narrow
street
and
he
saw
dim
figures
looming
against
it
with
a
glimmer
of
steel
it
was
indeed
the
street
watch
investigating
the
noise
they
had
heard
echoing
down
the
alley
goes
there
they
shouted
and
conan
grit
his
teeth
at
the
hated
nemedian
accent
behind
me
he
ordered
the
girl
got
to
cut
our
way
through
before
the
prison
guards
come
back
and
pin
us
between
them
and
grasping
his
sword
he
ran
straight
at
the
oncoming
figures
the
advantage
of
surprise
was
his
he
could
see
them
limned
against
the
distant
glow
and
they
could
not
see
him
coming
at
them
out
of
the
black
depths
of
the
alley
he
was
among
them
before
they
knew
it
smiting
with
the
silent
fury
of
a
wounded
lion
his
one
chance
lay
in
hacking
through
before
they
could
gather
their
wits
but
there
were
half
a
score
of
them
in
full
mail
veterans
of
the
border
wars
in
whom
the
instinct
for
battle
could
take
the
place
of
bemused
wits
three
of
them
were
down
before
they
realized
that
it
was
only
one
man
who
was
attacking
them
but
even
so
their
reaction
was
instantaneous
the
clangor
of
steel
rose
deafeningly
and
sparks
flew
as
conan
sword
crashed
on
basinet
and
hauberk
he
could
see
better
than
they
and
in
the
dim
light
his
swiftly
moving
figure
was
an
uncertain
mark
flailing
swords
cut
empty
air
or
glanced
from
his
blade
and
when
he
struck
it
was
with
the
fury
and
certainty
of
a
hurricane
but
behind
him
sounded
the
shouts
of
the
prison
guards
returning
up
the
alley
at
a
run
and
still
the
mailed
figures
before
him
barred
his
way
with
a
bristling
wall
of
steel
in
an
instant
the
guards
would
be
on
his
back
in
desperation
he
redoubled
his
strokes
flailing
like
a
smith
on
an
anvil
and
then
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
diversion
out
of
nowhere
behind
the
watchmen
rose
a
score
of
black
figures
and
there
was
a
sound
of
blows
murderously
driven
steel
glinted
in
the
gloom
and
men
cried
out
struck
mortally
from
behind
in
an
instant
the
alley
was
littered
with
writhing
forms
a
dark
cloaked
shape
sprang
toward
conan
who
heaved
up
his
sword
catching
a
gleam
of
steel
in
the
right
hand
but
the
other
was
extended
to
him
empty
and
a
voice
hissed
urgently
way
your
majesty
quickly
with
a
muttered
oath
of
surprise
conan
caught
up
albiona
in
one
massive
arm
and
followed
his
unknown
befriender
he
was
not
inclined
to
hesitate
with
thirty
prison
guardsmen
closing
in
behind
him
surrounded
by
mysterious
figures
he
hurried
down
the
alley
carrying
the
countess
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
he
could
tell
nothing
of
his
rescuers
except
that
they
wore
dark
cloaks
and
hoods
doubt
and
suspicion
crossed
his
mind
but
at
least
they
had
struck
down
his
enemies
and
he
saw
no
better
course
than
to
follow
them
as
if
sensing
his
doubt
the
leader
touched
his
arm
lightly
and
said
not
king
conan
we
are
your
loyal
subjects
the
voice
was
not
familiar
but
the
accent
was
aquilonian
of
the
central
provinces
behind
them
the
guards
were
yelling
as
they
stumbled
over
the
shambles
in
the
mud
and
they
came
pelting
vengefully
down
the
alley
seeing
the
vague
dark
mass
moving
between
them
and
the
light
of
the
distant
street
but
the
hooded
men
turned
suddenly
toward
the
seemingly
blank
wall
and
conan
saw
a
door
gape
there
he
muttered
a
curse
he
had
traversed
that
alley
by
day
in
times
past
and
had
never
noticed
a
door
there
but
through
it
they
went
and
the
door
closed
behind
them
with
the
click
of
a
lock
the
sound
was
not
reassuring
but
his
guides
were
hurrying
him
on
moving
with
the
precision
of
familiarity
guiding
conan
with
a
hand
at
either
elbow
it
was
like
traversing
a
tunnel
and
conan
felt
albiona
lithe
limbs
trembling
in
his
arms
then
somewhere
ahead
of
them
an
opening
was
faintly
visible
merely
a
somewhat
less
black
arch
in
the
blackness
and
through
this
they
filed
after
that
there
was
a
bewildering
succession
of
dim
courts
and
shadowy
alleys
and
winding
corridors
all
traversed
in
utter
silence
until
at
last
they
emerged
into
a
broad
lighted
chamber
the
location
of
which
conan
could
not
even
guess
for
their
devious
route
had
confused
even
his
primitive
sense
of
direction
a
coin
from
acheron
not
all
his
guides
entered
the
chamber
when
the
door
closed
conan
saw
only
one
man
standing
before
him
a
slim
figure
masked
in
a
black
cloak
with
a
hood
this
the
man
threw
back
disclosing
a
pale
oval
of
a
face
with
calm
delicately
chiseled
features
the
king
set
albiona
on
her
feet
but
she
still
clung
to
him
and
stared
apprehensively
about
her
the
chamber
was
a
large
one
with
marble
walls
partly
covered
with
black
velvet
hangings
and
thick
rich
carpets
on
the
mosaic
floor
laved
in
the
soft
golden
glow
of
bronze
lamps
conan
instinctively
laid
a
hand
on
his
hilt
there
was
blood
on
his
hand
blood
clotted
about
the
mouth
of
his
scabbard
for
he
had
sheathed
his
blade
without
cleansing
it
are
we
he
demanded
the
stranger
answered
with
a
low
profound
bow
in
which
the
suspicious
king
could
detect
no
trace
of
irony
the
temple
of
asura
your
majesty
albiona
cried
out
faintly
and
clung
closer
to
conan
staring
fearfully
at
the
black
arched
doors
as
if
expecting
the
entry
of
some
grisly
shape
of
darkness
not
my
lady
said
their
guide
is
nothing
here
to
harm
you
vulgar
superstition
to
the
contrary
if
your
monarch
was
sufficiently
convinced
of
the
innocence
of
our
religion
to
protect
us
from
the
persecution
of
the
ignorant
then
certainly
one
of
his
subjects
need
have
no
apprehensions
are
you
demanded
conan
am
hadrathus
priest
of
asura
one
of
my
followers
recognized
you
when
you
entered
the
city
and
brought
the
word
to
me
conan
grunted
profanely
not
fear
that
others
discovered
your
identity
hadrathus
assured
him
disguise
would
have
deceived
any
but
a
follower
of
asura
whose
cult
it
is
to
seek
below
the
aspect
of
illusion
you
were
followed
to
the
watch
tower
and
some
of
my
people
went
into
the
tunnel
to
aid
you
if
you
returned
by
that
route
others
myself
among
them
surrounded
the
tower
and
now
king
conan
it
is
yours
to
command
here
in
the
temple
of
asura
you
are
still
king
should
you
risk
your
lives
for
me
asked
the
king
were
our
friend
when
you
sat
upon
your
throne
answered
hadrathus
protected
us
when
the
priests
of
mitra
sought
to
scourge
us
out
of
the
land
conan
looked
about
him
curiously
he
had
never
before
visited
the
temple
of
asura
had
not
certainly
known
that
there
was
such
a
temple
in
tarantia
the
priests
of
the
religion
had
a
habit
of
hiding
their
temples
in
a
remarkable
fashion
the
worship
of
mitra
was
overwhelmingly
predominant
in
the
hyborian
nations
but
the
cult
of
asura
persisted
in
spite
of
official
ban
and
popular
antagonism
conan
had
been
told
dark
tales
of
hidden
temples
where
intense
smoke
drifted
up
incessantly
from
black
altars
where
kidnapped
humans
were
sacrificed
before
a
great
coiled
serpent
whose
fearsome
head
swayed
for
ever
in
the
haunted
shadows
persecution
caused
the
followers
of
asura
to
hide
their
temples
with
cunning
art
and
to
veil
their
rituals
in
obscurity
and
this
secrecy
in
turn
evoked
more
monstrous
suspicions
and
tales
of
evil
but
conan
was
the
broad
tolerance
of
the
barbarian
and
he
had
refused
to
persecute
the
followers
of
asura
or
to
allow
the
people
to
do
so
on
no
better
evidence
than
was
presented
against
them
rumors
and
accusations
that
could
not
be
proven
they
are
black
magicians
he
had
said
will
they
suffer
you
to
harry
them
if
they
are
not
there
is
no
evil
in
them
crom
devils
let
men
worship
what
gods
they
will
at
a
respectful
invitation
from
hadrathus
he
seated
himself
on
an
ivory
chair
and
motioned
albiona
to
another
but
she
preferred
to
sit
on
a
golden
stool
at
his
feet
pressing
close
against
his
thigh
as
if
seeking
security
in
the
contact
like
most
orthodox
followers
of
mitra
she
had
an
intuitive
horror
of
the
followers
and
cult
of
asura
instilled
in
her
infancy
and
childhood
by
wild
tales
of
human
sacrifice
and
anthropomorphic
gods
shambling
through
shadowy
temples
hadrathus
stood
before
them
his
uncovered
head
bowed
is
your
wish
your
majesty
first
he
grunted
and
the
priest
smote
a
golden
gong
with
a
silver
wand
scarcely
had
the
mellow
notes
ceased
echoing
when
four
hooded
figures
came
through
a
curtained
doorway
bearing
a
great
silver
platter
of
smoking
dishes
and
crystal
vessels
this
they
set
before
conan
bowing
low
and
the
king
wiped
his
hands
on
the
damask
and
smacked
his
lips
with
unconcealed
relish
your
majesty
whispered
albiona
folk
eat
human
flesh
stake
my
kingdom
that
this
is
nothing
but
honest
roast
beef
answered
conan
lass
fall
to
you
must
be
hungry
after
the
prison
fare
thus
advised
and
with
the
example
before
her
of
one
whose
word
was
the
ultimate
law
to
her
the
countess
complied
and
ate
ravenously
though
daintily
while
her
liege
lord
tore
into
the
meat
joints
and
guzzled
the
wine
with
as
much
gusto
as
if
he
had
not
already
eaten
once
that
night
priests
are
shrewd
hadrathus
he
said
with
a
great
in
his
hands
and
his
mouth
full
of
meat
welcome
your
service
in
my
campaign
to
regain
my
kingdom
slowly
hadrathus
shook
his
head
and
conan
slammed
the
down
on
the
table
in
a
gust
of
impatient
wrath
devils
what
ails
the
men
of
aquilonia
first
servius
now
you
can
you
do
nothing
but
wag
your
idiotic
heads
when
i
speak
of
ousting
these
dogs
hadrathus
sighed
and
answered
slowly
lord
it
is
ill
to
say
and
i
fain
would
say
otherwise
but
the
freedom
of
aquilonia
is
at
an
end
nay
the
freedom
of
the
whole
world
may
be
at
an
end
age
follows
age
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
now
we
enter
an
age
of
horror
and
slavery
as
it
was
long
ago
do
you
mean
demanded
the
king
uneasily
hadrathus
dropped
into
a
chair
and
rested
his
elbows
on
his
thighs
staring
at
the
floor
is
not
alone
the
rebellious
lords
of
aquilonia
and
the
armies
of
nemedia
which
are
arrayed
against
you
answered
hadrathus
is
sorcery
grisly
black
magic
from
the
grim
youth
of
the
world
an
awful
shape
has
risen
out
of
the
shades
of
the
past
and
none
can
stand
before
it
do
you
mean
conan
repeated
speak
of
xaltotun
of
acheron
who
died
three
thousand
years
ago
yet
walks
the
earth
today
conan
was
silent
while
in
his
mind
floated
an
image
the
image
of
a
bearded
face
of
calm
inhuman
beauty
again
he
was
haunted
by
a
sense
of
uneasy
familiarity
acheron
the
sound
of
the
word
roused
instinctive
vibrations
of
memory
and
associations
in
his
mind
he
repeated
of
acheron
man
are
you
mad
acheron
has
been
a
myth
for
more
centuries
than
i
can
remember
i
often
wondered
if
it
ever
existed
at
all
was
a
black
reality
answered

empire
of
black
magicians
steeped
in
evil

long
forgotten
it
was

of
that
accursed
kingdom
none
was
so
great
as
xaltotun

how
was
he
ever
overthrown
asked
conan
skeptically
some
means
a
source
of
cosmic
power
which
he
jealously
guarded
was
stolen
and
turned
against
him
that
source
has
been
returned
to
him
and
he
is
invincible
albiona
hugging
the
headsman
black
cloak
about
her
stared
from
the
priest
to
the
king
not
understanding
the
conversation
conan
shook
his
head
angrily
are
making
game
of
me
he
growled
xaltotun
has
been
dead
three
thousand
years
how
can
this
man
be
he
it
some
rogue
taken
the
old
one
name
hadrathus
leaned
to
an
ivory
table
and
opened
a
small
gold
chest
which
stood
there
from
it
he
took
something
which
glinted
dully
in
the
mellow
light
a
broad
gold
coin
of
antique
minting
have
seen
xaltotun
unveiled
then
look
upon
this
it
is
a
coin
which
was
stamped
in
ancient
acheron
before
its
fall
so
pervaded
with
sorcery
was
that
black
empire
that
even
this
coin
has
its
uses
in
making
magic
conan
took
it
and
scowled
down
at
it
there
was
no
mistaking
its
great
antiquity
conan
had
handled
many
coins
in
the
years
of
his
plunderings
and
had
a
good
practical
knowledge
of
them
the
edges
were
worn
and
the
inscription
almost
obliterated
but
the
countenance
stamped
on
one
side
was
still
and
distinct
and
conan
breath
sucked
in
between
his
clenched
teeth
it
was
not
cool
in
the
chamber
but
he
felt
a
prickling
of
his
scalp
an
icy
contraction
of
his
flesh
the
countenance
was
that
of
a
bearded
man
inscrutable
with
a
calm
inhuman
beauty
crom
it
he
muttered
conan
he
understood
now
the
sense
of
familiarity
that
the
sight
of
the
bearded
man
had
roused
in
him
from
the
first
he
had
seen
a
coin
like
this
once
before
long
ago
in
a
far
land
with
a
shake
of
his
shoulders
he
growled
likeness
is
only
a
coincidence
or
if
he
shrewd
enough
to
assume
a
forgotten
name
he
shrewd
enough
to
assume
his
likeness
but
he
spoke
without
conviction
the
sight
of
that
coin
had
shaken
the
foundations
of
his
universe
he
felt
that
reality
and
stability
were
crumbing
into
an
abyss
of
illusion
and
sorcery
a
wizard
was
understandable
but
this
was
diabolism
beyond
sanity
can
not
doubt
that
it
is
indeed
xaltotun
of
python
said
hadrathus
it
was
who
shook
down
the
cliffs
at
valkia
by
his
spells
that
enthrall
the
elementals
of
the
earth
he
it
was
who
sent
the
creature
of
darkness
into
your
tent
before
dawn
conan
scowled
at
him
did
you
know
that
followers
of
asura
have
secret
channels
of
knowledge
that
does
not
matter
but
do
you
realize
the
futility
of
sacrificing
your
subjects
in
a
vain
attempt
to
regain
your
crown
conan
rested
his
chin
on
his
fist
and
stared
grimly
into
nothing
albiona
watched
him
anxiously
her
mind
groping
bewildered
in
the
mazes
of
the
problem
that
confronted
him
there
no
wizard
in
the
world
who
could
make
magic
to
fight
xaltotun
magic
he
asked
at
last
hadrathus
shook
his
head
there
were
we
of
asura
would
know
of
him
men
say
our
cult
is
a
survival
of
the
ancient
stygian
that
is
a
lie
our
ancestors
came
from
vendhya
beyond
the
sea
of
vilayet
and
the
blue
himelian
mountains
we
are
sons
of
the
east
not
the
south
and
we
have
knowledge
of
all
the
wizards
of
the
east
who
are
greater
than
the
wizards
of
the
west
and
not
one
of
them
but
would
be
a
straw
in
the
wind
before
the
black
might
of
xaltotun
he
was
conquered
once
persisted
conan
a
cosmic
source
was
turned
against
him
but
now
that
source
is
again
in
his
hands
and
he
will
see
that
it
is
not
stolen
again
what
is
this
damnable
source
demanded
conan
irritably
is
called
the
heart
of
ahriman
when
acheron
was
overthrown
the
primitive
priest
who
had
stolen
it
and
turned
it
against
xaltotun
hid
it
in
a
haunted
cavern
and
built
a
small
temple
over
the
cavern
thrice
thereafter
the
temple
was
rebuilt
each
time
greater
and
more
elaborately
than
before
but
always
on
the
site
of
the
original
shrine
though
men
forgot
the
reason
therefor
memory
of
the
hidden
symbol
faded
from
the
minds
of
common
men
and
was
preserved
only
in
priestly
books
and
esoteric
volumes
whence
it
came
no
one
knows
some
say
it
is
the
veritable
heart
of
a
god
others
that
it
is
a
star
that
fell
from
the
skies
long
ago
until
it
was
stolen
none
had
looked
upon
it
for
three
thousand
years
the
magic
of
the
mitran
priests
failed
against
the
magic
of
xaltotun
acolyte
altaro
they
remembered
the
ancient
legend
of
the
heart
and
the
high
priest
and
an
acolyte
went
down
into
the
dark
and
terrible
crypt
below
the
temple
into
which
no
priest
had
descended
for
three
thousand
years
in
the
ancient
volumes
which
speak
of
the
heart
in
their
cryptic
symbolism
it
is
also
told
of
a
creature
of
darkness
left
by
the
ancient
priest
to
guard
it
down
in
a
square
chamber
with
arched
doorways
leading
off
into
immeasurable
blackness
the
priest
and
his
acolytes
found
a
black
stone
altar
that
glowed
dimly
with
inexplicable
radiance
that
altar
lay
a
curious
gold
vessel
like
a
which
clung
to
the
stone
like
a
barnacle
but
it
gaped
open
and
empty
the
heart
of
ahriman
was
gone
while
they
stared
in
horror
the
keeper
of
the
crypt
the
creature
of
darkness
came
upon
them
and
mangled
the
high
priest
so
that
he
died
but
the
acolyte
fought
off
the
being
a
mindless
soulless
waif
of
the
pits
brought
long
ago
to
guard
the
heart
and
escaped
up
the
long
black
narrow
stairs
carrying
the
dying
priest
who
before
he
died
gasped
out
the
news
to
his
followers
bade
them
submit
to
a
power
they
could
not
overcome
and
commanded
secrecy
but
the
word
has
been
whispered
about
among
the
priests
and
we
of
asura
learned
of
it
xaltotun
draws
his
power
from
this
symbol
asked
conan
still
skeptical
his
power
is
drawn
from
the
black
gulf
but
the
heart
of
ahriman
came
from
some
far
universe
of
flaming
light
and
against
it
the
powers
of
darkness
can
not
stand
when
it
is
in
the
hands
of
an
adept
it
is
like
a
sword
that
might
smite
at
him
not
a
sword
with
which
he
can
smite
it
restores
life
and
can
destroy
life
he
has
stolen
it
not
to
use
against
his
enemies
but
to
keep
them
from
using
it
against
him
bowl
of
gold
on
a
black
altar
in
a
deep
cavern
conan
muttered
frowning
as
he
sought
to
capture
the
illusive
image
reminds
me
of
something
i
have
heard
or
seen
but
what
in
crom
name
is
this
notable
heart
is
in
the
form
of
a
great
jewel
like
a
ruby
but
pulsing
with
blinding
fire
with
which
no
ruby
ever
burned
it
glows
like
living
flame
but
conan
sprang
suddenly
up
and
smote
his
right
fist
into
his
left
palm
like
a
thunderclap
he
roared
a
fool
i
been
the
heart
of
ahriman
the
heart
of
my
kingdom
find
the
heart
of
my
kingdom
zelata
said
by
ymir
it
was
the
jewel
i
saw
in
the
green
smoke
the
jewel
which
tarascus
stole
from
xaltotun
while
he
lay
in
the
sleep
of
the
black
lotus
hadrathus
was
also
on
his
feet
his
calm
dropped
from
him
like
a
garment
are
you
saying
the
heart
stolen
from
xaltotun
conan
boomed
feared
xaltotun
and
wanted
to
cripple
his
power
which
he
thought
resided
in
the
heart
maybe
he
thought
the
wizard
would
die
if
the
heart
was
lost
by
crom
ahhh
with
a
savage
grimace
of
disappointment
and
disgust
he
dropped
his
clenched
hand
to
his
side
forgot
tarascus
gave
it
to
a
thief
to
throw
into
the
sea
by
this
time
the
fellow
must
be
almost
to
kordava
before
i
can
follow
him
take
ship
and
consign
the
heart
to
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
sea
will
not
hold
it
exclaimed
hadrathus
quivering
with
excitement
would
himself
have
cast
it
into
the
ocean
long
ago
had
he
not
known
that
the
first
storm
would
carry
it
ashore
but
on
what
unknown
beach
might
it
not
land
conan
was
recovering
some
of
his
resilient
confidence
no
assurance
that
the
thief
will
throw
it
away
if
i
know
thieves
and
i
should
for
i
was
a
thief
in
zamora
in
my
early
youth
he
wo
throw
it
away
he
sell
it
to
some
rich
trader
by
crom
he
strode
back
and
forth
in
his
growing
excitement
worth
looking
for
zelata
bade
me
find
the
heart
of
my
kingdom
and
all
else
she
showed
me
proved
to
be
truth
can
it
be
that
the
power
to
conquer
xaltotun
lurks
in
that
crimson
bauble
my
head
upon
it
cried
hadrathus
his
face
lightened
with
fervor
his
eyes
blazing
his
fists
clenched
it
in
our
hands
we
can
dare
the
powers
of
xaltotun
i
swear
it
if
we
can
recover
it
we
have
an
even
chance
of
recovering
your
crown
and
driving
the
invaders
from
our
portals
it
is
not
the
swords
of
nemedia
that
aquilonia
fears
but
the
black
arts
of
xaltotun
conan
looked
at
him
for
a
space
impressed
by
the
priest
fire
like
a
quest
in
a
nightmare
he
said
at
last
your
words
echo
the
thought
of
zelata
and
all
else
she
said
was
truth
i
seek
for
this
jewel
holds
the
destiny
of
aquilonia
said
hadrathus
with
conviction
will
send
men
with
you
exclaimed
the
king
impatiently
not
caring
to
be
hampered
by
priests
on
his
quest
however
skilled
in
esoteric
arts
is
a
task
for
a
fighting
man
i
go
alone
first
to
poitain
where
i
leave
albiona
with
trocero
then
to
kordava
and
to
the
sea
beyond
if
necessary
it
may
be
that
even
if
the
thief
intends
carrying
out
tarascus
order
he
have
some
difficulty
finding
an
outbound
ship
at
this
time
of
the
year
if
you
find
the
heart
cried
hadrathus
will
prepare
the
way
for
your
conquest
before
you
return
to
aquilonia
i
will
spread
the
word
through
secret
channels
that
you
live
and
are
returning
with
a
magic
stronger
than
xaltotun
i
will
have
men
ready
to
rise
on
your
return
they
will
rise
if
they
have
assurance
that
they
will
be
protected
from
the
black
arts
of
xaltotun
i
will
aid
you
on
your
journey
he
rose
and
struck
a
gong
secret
tunnel
leads
from
beneath
this
temple
to
a
place
outside
the
city
wall
you
shall
go
to
poitain
on
a
pilgrim
boat
none
will
dare
molest
you
you
will
with
a
definite
purpose
in
mind
conan
was
afire
with
impatience
and
dynamic
energy
let
it
be
done
swiftly
in
the
meantime
events
were
moving
not
slowly
elsewhere
in
the
city
a
breathless
messenger
had
burst
into
the
palace
where
valerius
was
amusing
himself
with
his
and
throwing
himself
on
his
knee
gasped
out
a
garbled
story
of
a
bloody
prison
break
and
the
escape
of
a
lovely
captive
he
bore
also
the
news
that
count
thespius
to
whom
the
execution
of
albiona
sentence
had
been
entrusted
was
dying
and
begging
for
a
word
with
valerius
before
he
passed
hurriedly
cloaking
himself
valerius
accompanied
the
man
through
various
winding
ways
and
came
to
a
chamber
where
thespius
lay
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
count
was
dying
bloody
froth
bubbled
from
his
lips
at
each
shuddering
gasp
his
severed
arm
had
been
bound
to
stop
the
flow
of
blood
but
even
without
that
the
gash
in
his
side
was
mortal
alone
in
the
chamber
with
the
dying
man
valerius
swore
softly
mitra
i
had
believed
that
only
one
man
ever
lived
who
could
strike
such
a
blow
gasped
the
dying
man
lives
conan
lives
are
you
saying
ejaculated
the
other
swear
by
mitra
gurgled
thespius
gagging
on
the
blood
that
gushed
to
his
lips
was
he
who
carried
off
albiona
he
is
not
dead
no
phantom
come
back
from
hell
to
haunt
us
he
is
flesh
and
blood
and
more
terrible
than
ever
the
alley
behind
the
tower
is
full
of
dead
men
beware
valerius
he
has
come
back
to
slay
us
all
a
strong
shudder
shook
the
figure
and
count
thespius
went
limp
valerius
frowned
down
at
the
dead
man
cast
a
swift
glance
about
the
empty
chamber
and
stepping
swiftly
to
the
door
cast
it
open
suddenly
the
messenger
and
a
group
of
nemedian
guardsmen
stood
several
paces
down
the
corridor
valerius
muttered
something
that
might
have
indicated
satisfaction
all
the
gates
been
closed
he
demanded
your
majesty
the
guards
at
each
let
no
one
enter
or
leave
the
city
without
strictest
investigation
set
men
scouring
the
streets
and
searching
the
quarters
a
very
valuable
prisoner
has
escaped
with
the
aid
of
an
aquilonian
rebel
did
any
of
you
recognize
the
man
your
majesty
the
old
watchman
had
a
glimpse
of
him
but
could
only
say
that
he
was
a
giant
clad
in
the
black
garb
of
the
executioner
whose
naked
body
we
found
in
an
empty
cell
is
a
dangerous
man
said
valerius
no
chances
with
him
you
all
know
the
countess
albiona
search
for
her
and
if
you
find
her
kill
her
and
her
companion
instantly
do
not
try
to
take
them
alive
returning
to
his
palace
chamber
valerius
summoned
before
him
four
men
of
curious
and
alien
aspect
they
were
tall
gaunt
of
yellowish
skin
and
immobile
countenances
they
were
very
similar
in
appearance
clad
alike
in
long
black
robes
beneath
which
their
sandaled
feet
were
just
visible
their
features
were
shadowed
by
their
hoods
they
stood
before
valerius
with
their
hands
in
their
wide
sleeves
their
arms
folded
valerius
looked
at
them
without
pleasure
in
his
far
journeyings
he
had
encountered
many
strange
races
i
found
you
starving
in
the
khitan
jungles
he
said
abruptly
from
your
kingdom
you
swore
to
serve
me
you
have
served
me
well
enough
in
your
abominable
way
one
more
service
i
require
and
then
i
set
you
free
of
your
oath
the
cimmerian
king
of
aquilonia
still
lives
in
spite
of
xaltotun
sorcery
or
perhaps
because
of
it
i
know
not
the
dark
mind
of
that
resurrected
devil
is
too
devious
and
subtle
for
a
mortal
man
to
fathom
but
while
conan
lives
i
am
not
safe
the
people
accepted
me
as
the
lesser
of
two
evils
when
they
thought
he
was
dead
let
him
reappear
and
the
throne
will
be
rocking
under
my
feet
in
revolution
before
i
can
lift
my
hand
my
allies
mean
to
use
him
to
replace
me
if
they
decide
i
have
served
my
purpose
i
do
not
know
i
do
know
that
this
planet
is
too
small
for
two
kings
of
aquilonia
seek
the
cimmerian
use
your
uncanny
talents
to
ferret
him
out
wherever
he
hides
or
runs
he
has
many
friends
in
tarantia
he
had
aid
when
he
carried
off
albiona
it
took
more
than
one
man
even
such
a
man
as
conan
to
wreak
all
that
slaughter
in
the
alley
outside
the
tower
but
no
more
take
your
staffs
and
strike
his
trail
where
that
trail
will
lead
you
i
know
not
but
find
him
and
when
you
find
him
slay
him
the
four
khitans
bowed
together
and
still
unspeaking
turned
and
padded
noiselessly
from
the
chamber
swords
of
the
south
dawn
that
rose
over
the
distant
hills
shone
on
the
sails
of
a
small
craft
that
dropped
down
the
river
which
curves
to
within
a
mile
of
the
walls
of
tarantia
and
loops
southward
like
a
great
shining
serpent
this
boat
differed
from
the
ordinary
craft
plying
the
broad
khorotas
fishermen
and
merchant
barges
loaded
with
rich
goods
it
was
long
and
slender
with
a
high
curving
prow
and
was
black
as
ebony
with
white
skulls
painted
along
the
gunwales
amidships
rose
a
small
cabin
the
windows
closely
masked
other
craft
gave
the
ominously
painted
boat
a
wide
berth
for
it
was
obviously
one
of
those
boats
that
carried
a
lifeless
follower
of
asura
on
his
last
mysterious
pilgrimage
southward
to
where
far
beyond
the
poitanian
mountains
a
river
flowed
at
last
into
the
blue
ocean
in
that
cabin
undoubtedly
lay
the
corpse
of
the
departed
worshipper
all
men
were
familiar
with
the
sight
of
those
gloomy
craft
and
the
most
fanatical
votary
of
mitra
would
not
dare
touch
or
interfere
with
their
somber
voyages
where
the
ultimate
destination
lay
men
did
not
know
some
said
stygia
some
a
nameless
island
lying
beyond
the
horizon
others
said
it
was
in
the
glamorous
and
mysterious
land
of
vendhya
where
the
dead
came
home
at
last
but
none
knew
certainly
they
only
knew
that
when
a
follower
of
asura
died
the
corpse
went
southward
down
the
great
river
in
a
black
boat
rowed
by
a
giant
slave
and
neither
boat
nor
corpse
nor
slave
was
ever
seen
again
unless
indeed
certain
dark
tales
were
true
and
it
was
always
the
same
slave
who
rowed
the
boats
southward
the
man
who
propelled
this
particular
boat
was
as
huge
and
brown
as
the
others
though
closer
scrutiny
might
have
revealed
the
fact
that
the
hue
was
the
result
of
carefully
applied
pigments
he
was
clad
in
leather
and
sandals
and
he
handled
the
long
sweep
and
oars
with
unusual
skill
and
power
but
none
approached
the
grim
boat
closely
for
it
was
well
known
that
the
followers
of
asura
were
accursed
and
that
these
pilgrim
boats
were
loaded
with
dark
magic
so
men
swung
their
boats
wide
and
muttered
an
incantation
as
the
dark
craft
slid
past
and
they
never
dreamed
that
they
were
thus
assisting
in
the
flight
of
their
king
and
the
countess
albiona
it
was
a
strange
journey
in
that
black
slim
craft
down
the
great
river
for
nearly
two
hundred
miles
to
where
the
khorotas
swings
eastward
skirting
the
poitanian
mountains
like
a
dream
the
panorama
glided
past
during
the
day
albiona
lay
patiently
in
the
little
cabin
as
quietly
as
the
corpse
she
pretended
to
be
only
late
at
night
after
the
pleasure
boats
with
their
fair
occupants
lounging
on
silken
cushions
in
the
flare
of
torches
held
by
slaves
had
left
the
river
before
dawn
brought
the
hurrying
fisherboats
did
the
girl
venture
out
then
she
held
the
long
sweep
cunningly
bound
in
place
by
ropes
to
aid
her
while
conan
snatched
a
few
hours
of
sleep
but
the
king
needed
little
rest
the
fire
of
his
desire
drove
him
relentlessly
and
his
powerful
frame
was
equal
to
the
grinding
test
without
halt
or
pause
they
drove
southward
so
down
the
river
they
fled
through
nights
when
the
flowing
current
mirrored
the
million
stars
and
through
days
of
golden
sunlight
leaving
winter
behind
them
as
they
sped
southward
they
passed
cities
in
the
night
above
which
throbbed
and
pulsed
the
reflection
of
the
myriad
lights
lordly
river
villas
and
fertile
groves
so
at
last
the
blue
mountains
of
poitain
rose
above
them
tier
above
tier
like
ramparts
of
the
gods
and
the
great
river
swerving
from
those
turreted
cliffs
swept
thunderously
through
the
marching
hills
with
many
a
rapid
and
foaming
cataract
conan
scanned
the
shoreline
closely
and
finally
swung
the
long
sweep
and
headed
inshore
at
a
point
where
a
neck
of
land
jutted
into
the
water
and
fir
trees
grew
in
a
curiously
symmetrical
ring
about
a
gray
strangely
shaped
rock
these
boats
ride
those
falls
we
hear
roaring
ahead
of
us
is
more
than
i
can
see
he
grunted
said
they
did
but
here
where
we
halt
he
said
a
man
would
be
waiting
for
us
with
horses
but
i
see
anyone
how
word
of
our
coming
could
have
preceded
us
i
do
know
anyway
he
drove
inshore
and
bound
the
prow
to
an
arching
root
in
the
low
bank
and
then
plunging
into
the
water
washed
the
brown
paint
from
his
skin
and
emerged
dripping
and
in
his
natural
color
from
the
cabin
he
brought
forth
a
suit
of
aquilonian
which
hadrathus
had
procured
for
him
and
his
sword
these
he
donned
while
albiona
put
on
garments
suitable
for
mountain
travel
and
when
conan
was
fully
armed
and
turned
to
look
toward
the
shore
he
started
and
his
hand
went
to
his
sword
for
on
the
shore
under
the
trees
stood
a
figure
holding
the
reins
of
a
white
palfrey
and
a
bay
are
you
demanded
the
king
the
other
bowed
low
follower
of
asura
a
command
came
i
obeyed
came
inquired
conan
but
the
other
merely
bowed
again
have
come
to
guide
you
through
the
mountains
to
the
first
poitanian
stronghold
do
need
a
guide
answered
conan
know
these
hills
well
i
thank
you
for
the
horses
but
the
countess
and
i
will
attract
less
attention
alone
than
if
we
were
accompanied
by
an
acolyte
of
asura
the
man
bowed
profoundly
and
giving
the
reins
into
conan
hands
stepped
into
the
boat
casting
off
he
floated
down
the
swift
current
toward
the
distant
roar
of
the
unseen
rapids
with
a
baffled
shake
of
his
head
conan
lifted
the
countess
into
the
palfrey
saddle
and
then
mounted
the
and
reined
toward
the
summits
that
castellated
the
sky
the
rolling
country
at
the
foot
of
the
towering
mountains
was
now
a
borderland
in
a
state
of
turmoil
where
the
barons
reverted
to
feudal
practises
and
bands
of
outlaws
roamed
unhindered
poitain
had
not
formally
declared
her
separation
from
aquilonia
but
she
was
now
to
all
intents
a
kingdom
ruled
by
her
hereditary
count
trocero
the
rolling
south
country
had
submitted
nominally
to
valerius
but
he
had
not
attempted
to
force
the
passes
guarded
by
strongholds
where
the
crimson
leopard
banner
of
poitain
waved
defiantly
the
king
and
his
fair
companion
rode
up
the
long
blue
slopes
in
the
soft
evening
as
they
mounted
higher
the
rolling
country
spread
out
like
a
vast
purple
mantle
far
beneath
them
shot
with
the
shine
of
rivers
and
lakes
the
yellow
glint
of
broad
fields
and
the
white
gleam
of
distant
towers
ahead
of
them
and
far
above
they
glimpsed
the
first
of
the
poitanian
holds
a
strong
fortress
dominating
a
narrow
pass
the
crimson
banner
streaming
against
the
clear
blue
sky
before
they
reached
it
a
band
of
knights
in
burnished
armor
rode
from
among
the
trees
and
their
leader
sternly
ordered
the
travelers
to
halt
they
were
tall
men
with
the
dark
eyes
and
raven
locks
of
the
south
sir
and
state
your
business
and
why
you
ride
toward
poitain
poitain
in
revolt
then
asked
conan
watching
the
other
closely
a
man
in
aquilonian
harness
is
halted
and
questioned
like
a
foreigner
rogues
ride
out
of
aquilonia
these
days
answered
the
other
coldly
for
revolt
if
you
mean
the
repudiation
of
a
usurper
then
poitain
is
in
revolt
we
had
rather
serve
the
memory
of
a
dead
man
than
the
scepter
of
a
living
dog
conan
swept
off
his
helmet
and
shaking
back
his
black
mane
stared
full
at
the
speaker
the
poitanian
stared
violently
and
went
livid
of
heaven
he
gasped
is
the
king
alive
the
others
stared
wildly
then
a
roar
of
wonder
and
joy
burst
from
them
they
swarmed
about
conan
shouting
their
and
brandishing
their
swords
in
their
extreme
emotion
the
acclaim
of
poitanian
warriors
was
a
thing
to
terrify
a
timid
man
but
trocero
will
weep
tears
of
joy
to
see
you
sire
cried
one
and
prospero
shouted
another
general
has
been
like
one
wrapped
in
a
mantle
of
melancholy
and
curses
himself
night
and
day
that
he
did
not
reach
the
valkia
in
time
to
die
beside
his
king
we
will
strike
for
empery
yelled
another
whirling
his
great
sword
about
his
head
conan
king
of
poitain
the
clangor
of
bright
steel
about
him
and
the
thunder
of
their
acclaim
frightened
the
birds
that
rose
in
clouds
from
the
surrounding
trees
the
hot
southern
blood
was
afire
and
they
desired
nothing
but
for
their
sovereign
to
lead
them
to
battle
and
pillage
is
your
command
sire
they
cried
one
of
us
ride
ahead
and
bear
the
news
of
your
coming
into
poitain
banners
will
wave
from
every
tower
roses
will
carpet
the
road
before
your
horse
feet
and
all
the
beauty
and
chivalry
of
the
south
will
give
you
the
honor
due
you
conan
shook
his
head
could
doubt
your
loyalty
but
winds
blow
over
these
mountains
into
the
countries
of
my
enemies
and
i
would
rather
these
did
know
that
i
lived
yet
take
me
to
trocero
and
keep
my
identity
a
secret
so
what
the
knights
would
have
made
a
triumphal
procession
was
more
in
the
nature
of
a
secret
flight
they
traveled
in
haste
speaking
to
no
one
except
for
a
whisper
to
the
captain
on
duty
at
each
pass
and
conan
rode
among
them
with
his
vizor
lowered
the
mountains
were
uninhabited
save
by
outlaws
and
garrisons
of
soldiers
who
guarded
the
passes
the
poitanians
had
no
need
nor
desire
to
wrest
a
hard
and
scanty
living
from
their
stern
breasts
south
of
the
ranges
the
rich
and
beautiful
plains
of
poitain
stretched
to
the
river
alimane
but
beyond
the
river
lay
the
land
of
zingara
even
now
when
winter
was
crisping
the
leaves
beyond
the
mountains
the
tall
rich
grass
waved
upon
the
plains
where
grazed
the
horses
and
cattle
for
which
poitain
was
famed
palm
trees
and
orange
groves
smiled
in
the
sun
and
the
gorgeous
purple
and
gold
and
crimson
towers
of
castles
and
cities
reflected
the
golden
light
it
was
a
land
of
warmth
and
plenty
of
beautiful
men
and
ferocious
warriors
it
is
not
only
the
hard
lands
that
breed
hard
men
poitain
was
surrounded
by
covetous
neighbors
and
her
sons
learned
hardihood
in
incessant
wars
to
the
north
the
land
was
guarded
by
the
mountains
but
to
the
south
only
the
alimane
separated
the
plains
of
poitain
from
the
plains
of
zingara
and
not
once
but
a
thousand
times
had
that
river
run
red
to
the
east
lay
argos
and
beyond
that
ophir
proud
kingdoms
and
avaricious
the
knights
of
poitain
held
their
lands
by
the
weight
and
edge
of
their
swords
and
little
of
ease
and
idleness
they
knew
so
conan
came
presently
to
the
castle
of
count
trocero
conan
sat
on
a
silken
divan
in
a
rich
chamber
whose
filmy
curtains
the
warm
breeze
billowed
trocero
paced
the
floor
like
a
panther
a
lithe
restless
man
with
the
waist
of
a
woman
and
the
shoulders
of
a
swordsman
who
carried
his
years
lightly
us
proclaim
you
king
of
poitain
urged
the
count
those
northern
pigs
wear
the
yoke
to
which
they
have
bent
their
necks
the
south
is
still
yours
dwell
here
and
rule
us
amid
the
flowers
and
the
palms
but
conan
shook
his
head
is
no
nobler
land
on
earth
than
poitain
but
it
can
not
stand
alone
bold
as
are
its
sons
stand
alone
for
generations
retorted
trocero
with
the
quick
jealous
pride
of
his
breed
were
not
always
a
part
of
aquilonia
know
but
conditions
are
not
as
they
were
then
when
all
kingdoms
were
broken
into
principalities
which
warred
with
each
other
the
days
of
dukedoms
and
free
cities
are
past
the
days
of
empires
are
upon
us
rulers
are
dreaming
imperial
dreams
and
only
in
unity
is
there
strength
let
us
unite
zingara
with
poitain
argued
trocero
a
dozen
princes
strive
against
each
other
and
the
country
is
torn
asunder
by
civil
wars
we
will
conquer
it
province
by
province
and
add
it
to
your
dominions
then
with
the
aid
of
the
zingarans
we
will
conquer
argos
and
ophir
we
will
build
an
empire
again
conan
shook
his
head
others
dream
imperial
dreams
i
but
wish
to
hold
what
is
mine
i
have
no
desire
to
rule
an
empire
welded
together
by
blood
and
fire
it
one
thing
to
seize
a
throne
with
the
aid
of
its
subjects
and
rule
them
with
their
consent
it
another
to
subjugate
a
foreign
realm
and
rule
it
by
fear
i
do
wish
to
be
another
valerius
no
trocero
i
rule
all
aquilonia
and
no
more
or
i
rule
nothing
lead
us
over
the
mountains
and
we
will
smite
the
nemedians
conan
fierce
eyes
glowed
with
appreciation
trocero
it
would
be
a
vain
sacrifice
i
told
you
what
i
must
do
to
regain
my
kingdom
i
must
find
the
heart
of
ahriman
this
is
madness
protested
trocero
maunderings
of
a
heretical
priest
the
mumblings
of
a
mad
were
not
in
my
tent
before
valkia
answered
conan
grimly
involuntarily
glancing
at
his
right
wrist
on
which
blue
marks
still
showed
faintly
did
see
the
cliffs
thunder
down
to
crush
the
flower
of
my
army
no
trocero
i
been
convinced
xaltotun
no
mortal
man
and
only
with
the
heart
of
ahriman
can
i
stand
against
him
so
i
riding
to
kordava
alone
that
is
dangerous
protested
trocero
is
dangerous
rumbled
the
king
wo
go
as
king
of
aquilonia
or
even
as
a
knight
of
poitain
but
as
a
wandering
mercenary
as
i
rode
in
zingara
in
the
old
days
oh
i
have
enemies
enough
south
of
the
alimane
in
the
lands
and
the
waters
of
the
south
many
who
wo
know
me
as
king
of
aquilonia
will
remember
me
as
conan
of
the
barachan
pirates
or
amra
of
the
black
corsairs
but
i
have
friends
too
and
men
who
aid
me
for
their
own
private
reasons
a
faintly
reminiscent
grin
touched
his
lips
trocero
dropped
his
hands
helplessly
and
glanced
at
albiona
who
sat
on
a
divan
understand
your
doubts
my
lord
said
she
i
too
saw
the
coin
in
the
temple
of
asura
and
look
you
hadrathus
said
it
was
dated
five
hundred
years
the
fall
of
acheron
if
xaltotun
then
is
the
man
pictured
on
the
coin
as
his
majesty
swears
he
is
that
means
he
was
no
common
wizard
even
in
his
other
life
for
the
years
of
his
life
were
numbered
by
centuries
not
as
the
lives
of
other
men
are
numbered
before
trocero
could
reply
a
respectful
rap
was
heard
on
the
door
and
a
voice
called
lord
we
have
caught
a
man
skulking
about
the
castle
who
says
he
wishes
to
speak
with
your
guest
i
await
your
orders
spy
from
aquilonia
hissed
trocero
catching
at
his
dagger
but
conan
lifted
his
voice
and
called
the
door
and
let
me
see
him
the
door
was
opened
and
a
man
was
framed
in
it
grasped
on
either
hand
by
he
was
a
slender
man
clad
in
a
dark
hooded
robe
you
a
follower
of
asura
asked
conan
the
man
nodded
and
the
stalwart
looked
shocked
and
glanced
hesitantly
at
trocero
word
came
southward
said
the
man
the
alimane
we
can
not
aid
you
for
our
sect
goes
no
farther
southward
but
stretches
eastward
with
the
khorotas
but
this
i
have
learned
the
thief
who
took
the
heart
of
ahriman
from
tarascus
never
reached
kordava
in
the
mountains
of
poitain
he
was
slain
by
robbers
the
jewel
fell
into
the
hands
of
their
chief
who
not
knowing
its
true
nature
and
being
harried
after
the
destruction
of
his
band
by
poitanian
knights
sold
it
to
the
kothic
merchant
zorathus
conan
was
on
his
feet
galvanized
what
of
zorathus
days
ago
he
crossed
the
alimane
headed
for
argos
with
a
small
band
of
armed
servants
a
fool
to
cross
zingara
in
such
times
said
trocero
times
are
troublous
across
the
river
but
zorathus
is
a
bold
man
and
reckless
in
his
way
he
is
in
great
haste
to
reach
messantia
where
he
hopes
to
find
a
buyer
for
the
jewel
perhaps
he
hopes
to
sell
it
finally
in
stygia
perhaps
he
guesses
at
its
true
nature
at
any
rate
instead
of
following
the
long
road
that
winds
along
the
borders
of
poitain
and
so
at
last
comes
into
argos
far
from
messantia
he
has
struck
straight
across
eastern
zingara
following
the
shorter
and
more
direct
route
conan
smote
the
table
with
his
clenched
fist
so
that
the
great
board
quivered
by
crom
fortune
has
at
last
thrown
the
dice
for
me
a
horse
trocero
and
the
harness
of
a
free
companion
zorathus
has
a
long
start
but
not
too
long
for
me
to
overtake
him
if
i
follow
him
to
the
end
of
the
world
the
fang
of
the
dragon
at
dawn
conan
waded
his
horse
across
the
shallows
of
the
alimane
and
struck
the
wide
caravan
trail
which
ran
southeastward
and
behind
him
on
the
farther
bank
trocero
sat
his
horse
silently
at
the
head
of
his
knights
with
the
crimson
leopard
of
poitain
floating
its
long
folds
over
him
in
the
morning
breeze
silently
they
sat
those
men
in
shining
steel
until
the
figure
of
their
king
had
vanished
in
the
blue
of
distance
that
whitened
toward
sunrise
conan
rode
a
great
black
stallion
the
gift
of
trocero
he
no
longer
wore
the
armor
of
aquilonia
his
harness
proclaimed
him
a
veteran
of
the
free
companies
who
were
of
all
races
his
headpiece
was
a
plain
morion
dented
and
battered
the
leather
and
of
his
hauberk
were
worn
and
shiny
as
if
by
many
campaigns
and
the
scarlet
cloak
flowing
carelessly
from
his
mailed
shoulders
was
tattered
and
stained
he
looked
the
part
of
the
hired
who
had
known
all
vicissitudes
of
fortune
plunder
and
wealth
one
day
an
empty
purse
and
a
belt
the
next
and
more
than
looking
the
part
he
felt
the
part
the
awakening
of
old
memories
the
resurge
of
the
wild
mad
glorious
days
of
old
before
his
feet
were
set
on
the
imperial
path
when
he
was
a
wandering
mercenary
roistering
brawling
guzzling
adventuring
with
no
thought
for
the
morrow
and
no
desire
save
sparkling
ale
red
lips
and
a
keen
sword
to
swing
on
all
the
battlefields
of
the
world
unconsciously
he
reverted
to
the
old
ways
a
new
swagger
became
evident
in
his
bearing
in
the
way
he
sat
his
horse
oaths
rose
naturally
to
his
lips
and
as
he
rode
he
hummed
old
songs
that
he
had
roared
in
chorus
with
his
reckless
companions
in
many
a
tavern
and
on
many
a
dusty
road
or
bloody
field
it
was
an
unquiet
land
through
which
he
rode
the
companies
of
cavalry
which
usually
patrolled
the
river
alert
for
raids
out
of
poitain
were
nowhere
in
evidence
internal
strife
had
left
the
borders
unguarded
the
long
white
road
stretched
bare
from
horizon
to
horizon
no
laden
camel
trains
or
rumbling
wagons
or
lowing
herds
moved
along
it
now
only
occasional
groups
of
horsemen
in
leather
and
steel
men
who
kept
together
and
rode
warily
these
swept
conan
with
their
searching
gaze
but
rode
on
for
the
solitary
rider
harness
promised
no
plunder
but
only
hard
strokes
villages
lay
in
ashes
and
deserted
the
fields
and
meadows
idle
only
the
boldest
would
ride
the
roads
these
days
and
the
native
population
had
been
decimated
in
the
civil
wars
and
by
raids
from
across
the
river
in
more
peaceful
times
the
road
was
thronged
with
merchants
riding
poitain
to
messantia
in
argos
or
back
but
now
these
found
it
wiser
to
follow
the
road
that
led
east
through
poitain
and
then
turned
south
down
across
argos
it
was
longer
but
safer
only
an
extremely
reckless
man
would
risk
his
life
and
goods
on
this
road
through
zingara
the
southern
horizon
was
fringed
with
flame
by
night
and
in
the
day
straggling
pillars
of
smoke
drifted
upward
in
the
cities
and
plains
to
the
south
men
were
dying
thrones
were
toppling
and
castles
going
up
in
flames
conan
felt
the
old
tug
of
the
professional
to
turn
his
horse
and
plunge
into
the
fighting
the
pillaging
and
the
looting
as
in
the
days
of
old
why
should
he
toil
to
regain
the
rule
of
a
people
which
had
already
forgotten
him
why
chase
a
why
pursue
a
crown
that
was
lost
for
ever
why
should
he
not
seek
forgetfulness
lose
himself
in
the
red
tides
of
war
and
rapine
that
had
engulfed
him
so
often
before
could
he
not
indeed
carve
out
another
kingdom
for
himself
the
world
was
entering
an
age
of
iron
an
age
of
war
and
imperialistic
ambition
some
strong
man
might
well
rise
above
the
ruins
of
nations
as
a
supreme
conqueror
why
should
it
not
be
himself
so
his
familiar
devil
whispered
in
his
ear
and
the
phantoms
of
his
lawless
and
bloody
past
crowded
upon
him
but
he
did
not
turn
aside
he
rode
onward
following
a
quest
that
grew
dimmer
and
dimmer
as
he
advanced
until
sometimes
it
seemed
that
he
pursued
a
dream
that
never
was
he
pushed
the
black
stallion
as
hard
as
he
dared
but
the
long
white
road
lay
bare
before
him
from
horizon
to
horizon
it
was
a
long
start
zorathus
had
but
conan
rode
steadily
on
knowing
that
he
was
traveling
faster
than
the
burdened
merchants
could
travel
and
so
he
came
to
the
castle
of
count
valbroso
perched
like
a
vulture
eyrie
on
a
bare
hill
overlooking
the
road
valbroso
rode
down
with
his
a
lean
dark
man
with
glittering
eyes
and
a
predatory
beak
of
a
nose
he
wore
black
and
was
followed
by
thirty
spearmen
hawks
of
the
border
wars
as
avaricious
and
ruthless
as
himself
of
late
the
toll
of
the
caravans
had
been
slim
and
valbroso
cursed
the
civil
wars
that
stripped
the
roads
of
their
fat
traffic
even
while
he
blessed
them
for
the
free
hand
they
allowed
him
with
his
neighbors
he
had
not
hoped
much
from
the
solitary
rider
he
had
glimpsed
from
his
tower
but
all
was
grist
that
came
to
his
mill
with
a
practised
eye
he
took
in
conan
worn
mail
and
dark
scarred
face
and
his
conclusions
were
the
same
as
those
of
the
riders
who
had
passed
the
cimmerian
on
the
road
an
empty
purse
and
a
ready
blade
are
you
knave
he
demanded
mercenary
riding
for
argos
answered
conan
matter
names
are
riding
in
the
wrong
direction
for
a
free
companion
grunted
valbroso
the
fighting
is
good
and
also
the
plundering
join
my
company
you
wo
go
hungry
the
road
remains
bare
of
fat
merchants
to
strip
but
i
mean
to
take
my
rogues
and
fare
southward
to
sell
our
swords
to
whichever
side
seems
strongest
conan
did
not
at
once
reply
knowing
that
if
he
refused
outright
he
might
be
instantly
attacked
by
valbroso
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
the
zingaran
spoke
again
rogues
of
the
free
companies
always
know
tricks
to
make
men
talk
i
have
a
prisoner
the
last
merchant
i
caught
by
mitra
and
the
only
one
i
seen
for
a
week
and
the
knave
is
stubborn
he
has
an
iron
box
the
secret
of
which
defies
us
and
i
been
unable
to
persuade
him
to
open
it
by
ishtar
i
thought
i
knew
all
the
modes
of
persuasion
there
are
but
perhaps
you
as
a
veteran
free
companion
know
some
that
i
do
not
at
any
rate
come
with
me
and
see
what
you
may
do
valbroso
words
instantly
decided
conan
that
sounded
a
great
deal
like
zorathus
conan
did
not
know
the
merchant
but
any
man
who
was
stubborn
enough
to
try
to
traverse
the
zingaran
road
in
times
like
these
would
very
probably
be
stubborn
enough
to
defy
torture
he
fell
in
beside
valbroso
and
rode
up
the
straggling
road
to
the
top
of
the
hill
where
the
gaunt
castle
stood
as
a
he
should
have
ridden
behind
the
count
but
force
of
habit
made
him
careless
and
valbroso
paid
no
heed
years
of
life
on
the
border
had
taught
the
count
that
the
frontier
is
not
the
royal
court
he
was
aware
of
the
independence
of
the
mercenaries
behind
whose
swords
many
a
king
had
trodden
the
there
was
a
dry
moat
half
filled
with
debris
in
some
places
they
clattered
across
the
drawbridge
and
through
the
arch
of
the
gate
behind
them
the
portcullis
fell
with
a
sullen
clang
they
came
into
a
bare
courtyard
grown
with
straggling
grass
and
with
a
well
in
the
middle
shacks
for
the
straggled
about
the
bailey
wall
and
women
slatternly
or
decked
in
gaudy
finery
looked
from
the
doors
in
rusty
mail
tossed
dice
on
the
flags
under
the
arches
it
was
more
like
a
bandit
hold
than
the
castle
of
a
nobleman
valbroso
dismounted
and
motioned
conan
to
follow
him
they
went
through
a
doorway
and
along
a
vaulted
corridor
where
they
were
met
by
a
scarred
man
in
mail
descending
a
stone
staircase
evidently
the
captain
of
the
guard
beloso
quoth
valbroso
he
spoken
is
stubborn
muttered
beloso
shooting
a
glance
of
suspicion
at
conan
valbroso
ripped
out
an
oath
and
stamped
furiously
up
the
winding
stair
followed
by
conan
and
the
captain
as
they
mounted
the
groans
of
a
man
in
mortal
agony
became
audible
valbroso
was
high
above
the
court
instead
of
in
a
dungeon
below
in
that
chamber
where
a
gaunt
hairy
beast
of
a
man
in
leather
breeks
squatted
gnawing
a
voraciously
stood
the
machines
of
torture
racks
boots
hooks
and
all
the
implements
that
the
human
mind
devises
to
tear
flesh
break
bones
and
rend
and
rupture
veins
and
ligaments
on
a
rack
a
man
was
stretched
naked
and
a
glance
told
conan
that
he
was
dying
the
unnatural
elongation
of
his
limbs
and
body
told
of
unhinged
joints
and
unnamable
ruptures
he
was
a
dark
man
with
an
intelligent
aquiline
face
and
quick
dark
eyes
they
were
glazed
and
bloodshot
now
with
pain
and
the
dew
of
agony
glistened
on
his
face
his
lips
were
drawn
back
from
blackened
gums
is
the
box
viciously
valbroso
kicked
a
small
but
heavy
iron
chest
that
stood
on
the
floor
near
by
it
was
intricately
carved
with
tiny
skulls
and
writhing
dragons
curiously
intertwined
but
conan
saw
no
catch
or
hasp
that
might
serve
to
unlock
the
lid
the
marks
of
fire
of
ax
and
sledge
and
chisel
showed
on
it
but
as
scratches
is
the
dog
treasure
box
said
valbroso
angrily
men
of
the
south
know
of
zorathus
and
his
iron
chest
mitra
knows
what
is
in
it
but
he
will
not
give
up
its
secret
zorathus
it
was
true
then
the
man
he
sought
lay
before
him
heart
beat
suffocatingly
as
he
leaned
over
the
writhing
form
though
he
exhibited
no
evidence
of
his
painful
eagerness
those
ropes
knave
he
ordered
the
torturer
harshly
and
valbroso
and
his
captain
stared
in
the
forgetfulness
of
the
moment
conan
had
used
his
imperial
tone
and
the
brute
in
leather
instinctively
obeyed
the
of
command
in
that
voice
he
eased
away
gradually
for
else
the
slackening
of
the
ropes
had
been
as
great
a
torment
to
the
torn
joints
as
further
stretching
catching
up
a
vessel
of
wine
that
stood
near
by
conan
placed
the
rim
to
the
wretch
lips
zorathus
gulped
spasmodically
the
liquid
slopping
over
on
his
heaving
breast
into
the
bloodshot
eyes
came
a
gleam
of
recognition
and
the
lips
parted
from
them
issued
a
racking
whimper
in
the
kothic
tongue
this
death
then
is
the
long
agony
ended
for
this
is
king
conan
who
died
at
valkia
and
i
am
among
the
dead
not
dead
said
conan
you
dying
you
be
tortured
no
more
i
see
to
that
but
i
ca
help
you
further
yet
before
you
die
tell
me
how
to
open
your
iron
box
iron
box
mumbled
zorathus
in
delirious
disjointed
phrases
chest
forged
in
unholy
fires
among
the
flaming
mountains
of
khrosha
the
metal
no
chisel
can
cut
how
many
treasures
has
it
borne
across
the
width
and
the
breadth
of
the
world
but
no
such
treasure
as
it
now
holds
me
how
to
open
it
urged
conan
can
do
you
no
good
and
it
may
aid
me
you
are
conan
muttered
the
kothian
have
seen
you
sitting
on
your
throne
in
the
great
public
hall
of
tarantia
with
your
crown
on
your
head
and
the
scepter
in
your
hand
but
you
are
dead
you
died
at
valkia
and
so
i
know
my
own
end
is
at
hand
does
the
dog
say
demanded
valbroso
impatiently
not
understanding
kothic
he
tell
us
how
to
open
the
box
as
if
the
voice
roused
a
spark
of
life
in
the
twisted
breast
zorathus
rolled
his
bloodshot
eyes
toward
the
speaker
valbroso
will
i
tell
he
gasped
in
zingaran
is
upon
me
lean
close
to
me
valbroso
the
count
did
so
his
dark
face
lit
with
avarice
behind
him
his
saturnine
captain
beloso
crowded
closer
the
seven
skulls
on
the
rim
one
after
another
gasped
zorathus
then
the
head
of
the
dragon
that
writhes
across
the
lid
then
press
the
sphere
in
the
dragon
claws
that
will
release
the
secret
catch
the
box
cried
valbroso
with
an
oath
conan
lifted
it
and
set
it
on
a
dais
and
valbroso
shouldered
him
aside
me
open
it
cried
beloso
starting
forward
valbroso
cursed
him
back
his
greed
blazing
in
his
black
eyes
but
me
shall
open
it
he
cried
conan
whose
hand
had
instinctively
gone
to
his
hilt
glanced
at
zorathus
the
man
eyes
were
glazed
and
bloodshot
but
they
were
fixed
on
valbroso
with
burning
intensity
and
was
there
the
shadow
of
a
grim
twisted
smile
on
the
dying
man
lips
not
until
the
merchant
knew
he
was
dying
had
he
given
up
the
secret
conan
turned
to
watch
valbroso
even
as
the
dying
man
watched
him
along
the
rim
of
the
lid
seven
skulls
were
carved
among
intertwining
branches
of
strange
trees
an
inlaid
dragon
writhed
its
way
across
the
top
of
the
lid
amid
ornate
arabesques
valbroso
pressed
the
skulls
in
fumbling
haste
and
as
he
jammed
his
thumb
down
on
the
carved
head
of
the
dragon
he
swore
sharply
and
snatched
his
hand
away
shaking
it
in
irritation
sharp
point
on
the
carvings
he
snarled
pricked
my
thumb
he
pressed
the
gold
ball
clutched
in
the
dragon
talons
and
the
lid
flew
abruptly
open
their
eyes
were
dazzled
by
a
golden
flame
it
seemed
to
their
dazed
minds
that
the
carven
box
was
full
of
glowing
fire
that
spilled
over
the
rim
and
dripped
through
the
air
in
quivering
flakes
beloso
cried
out
and
valbroso
sucked
in
his
breath
conan
stood
speechless
his
brain
snared
by
the
blaze
what
a
jewel
valbroso
hand
dived
into
the
chest
came
out
with
a
great
pulsing
crimson
sphere
that
filled
the
room
with
a
lambent
glow
in
its
glare
valbroso
looked
like
a
corpse
and
the
dying
man
on
the
loosened
rack
laughed
wildly
and
suddenly
he
screamed
jewel
is
yours
i
give
you
death
with
it
the
scratch
on
your
thumb
look
at
the
dragon
head
valbroso
they
all
wheeled
stared
something
tiny
and
dully
gleaming
stood
up
from
the
gaping
carved
mouth
dragon
fang
shrieked
zorathus
in
the
venom
of
the
black
stygian
scorpion
fool
fool
to
open
the
box
of
zorathus
with
your
naked
hand
death
you
are
a
dead
man
now
and
with
bloody
foam
on
his
lips
he
died
valbroso
staggered
crying
out
mitra
i
burn
he
shrieked
veins
race
with
liquid
fire
my
joints
are
bursting
asunder
death
death
and
he
reeled
and
crashed
headlong
there
was
an
instant
of
awful
convulsions
in
which
the
limbs
were
twisted
into
hideous
and
unnatural
positions
and
then
in
that
posture
the
man
froze
his
glassy
eyes
staring
sightlessly
upward
his
lips
drawn
back
from
blackened
gums
muttered
conan
stooping
to
pick
up
the
jewel
where
it
rolled
on
the
floor
from
valbroso
rigid
hand
it
lay
on
the
floor
like
a
quivering
pool
of
sunset
fire
muttered
beloso
with
madness
in
his
eyes
and
then
he
moved
conan
was
caught
off
guard
his
eyes
dazzled
his
brain
dazed
by
the
blaze
of
the
great
gem
he
did
not
realize
beloso
intention
until
something
crashed
with
terrible
force
upon
his
helmet
the
glow
of
the
jewel
was
splashed
with
redder
flame
and
he
went
to
his
knees
under
the
blow
he
heard
a
rush
of
feet
a
bellow
of
agony
he
was
stunned
but
not
wholly
senseless
and
realized
that
beloso
had
caught
up
the
iron
box
and
crashed
it
down
on
his
head
as
he
stooped
only
his
basinet
had
saved
his
skull
he
staggered
up
drawing
his
sword
trying
to
shake
the
dimness
out
of
his
eyes
the
room
swam
to
his
dizzy
gaze
but
the
door
was
open
and
fleet
footsteps
were
dwindling
down
the
winding
stair
on
the
floor
the
brutish
torturer
was
gasping
out
his
life
with
a
great
gash
under
his
breast
and
the
heart
of
ahriman
was
gone
conan
reeled
out
of
the
chamber
sword
in
hand
blood
streaming
down
his
face
from
under
his
burganet
he
ran
drunkenly
down
the
steps
hearing
a
clang
of
steel
in
the
courtyard
below
shouts
then
the
frantic
drum
of
hoofs
rushing
into
the
bailey
he
saw
the
milling
about
confusedly
while
women
screeched
the
postern
gate
stood
open
and
a
soldier
lay
across
his
pike
with
his
head
split
horses
still
bridled
and
saddled
ran
neighing
about
the
court
conan
black
stallion
among
them
mad
howled
a
woman
wringing
her
hands
as
she
rushed
brainlessly
about
came
out
of
the
castle
like
a
mad
dog
hewing
right
and
left
beloso
mad
where
lord
valbroso
way
did
he
go
roared
conan
all
turned
and
stared
at
the
stranger
face
and
naked
sword
the
postern
shrilled
a
woman
pointing
eastward
and
another
bawled
is
this
rogue
has
killed
valbroso
yelled
conan
leaping
and
seizing
the
stallion
mane
as
the
advanced
uncertainly
on
him
a
wild
outcry
burst
forth
at
his
news
but
their
reaction
was
exactly
as
he
had
anticipated
instead
of
closing
the
gates
to
take
him
prisoner
or
pursuing
the
fleeing
slayer
to
avenge
their
lord
they
were
thrown
into
even
greater
confusion
by
his
words
wolves
bound
together
only
by
fear
of
valbroso
they
owed
no
allegiance
to
the
castle
or
to
each
other
swords
began
to
clash
in
the
courtyard
and
women
screamed
and
in
the
midst
of
it
all
none
noticed
conan
as
he
shot
through
the
postern
gate
and
thundered
down
the
hill
the
wide
plain
spread
before
him
and
beyond
the
hill
the
caravan
road
divided
one
branch
ran
south
the
other
east
and
on
the
eastern
road
he
saw
another
rider
bending
low
and
spurring
hard
the
plain
swam
to
conan
gaze
the
sunlight
was
a
thick
red
haze
and
he
reeled
in
his
saddle
grasping
the
flowing
mane
with
his
hand
blood
rained
on
his
mail
but
grimly
he
urged
the
stallion
on
behind
him
smoke
began
to
pour
out
of
the
castle
on
the
hill
where
the
count
body
lay
forgotten
and
unheeded
beside
that
of
his
prisoner
the
sun
was
setting
against
a
lurid
red
sky
the
two
black
figures
fled
the
stallion
was
not
fresh
but
neither
was
the
horse
ridden
by
beloso
but
the
great
beast
responded
mightily
calling
on
deep
reservoirs
of
reserve
vitality
why
the
zingaran
fled
from
one
pursuer
conan
did
not
tax
his
bruised
brain
to
guess
perhaps
unreasoning
panic
rode
beloso
born
of
the
madness
that
lurked
in
that
blazing
jewel
the
sun
was
gone
the
white
road
was
a
dim
glimmer
through
a
ghostly
twilight
fading
into
purple
gloom
far
ahead
of
him
the
stallion
panted
laboring
hard
the
country
was
changing
in
the
gathering
dusk
bare
plains
gave
way
to
clumps
of
oaks
and
alders
low
hills
mounted
up
in
the
distance
stars
began
to
blink
out
the
stallion
gasped
and
reeled
in
his
course
but
ahead
rose
a
dense
wood
that
stretched
to
the
hills
on
the
horizon
and
between
it
and
himself
conan
glimpsed
the
dim
form
of
the
fugitive
he
urged
on
the
distressed
stallion
for
he
saw
that
he
was
overtaking
his
prey
yard
by
yard
above
the
pound
of
the
hoofs
a
strange
cry
rose
from
the
shadows
but
neither
pursuer
nor
pursued
gave
heed
as
they
swept
in
under
the
branches
that
overhung
the
road
they
were
almost
side
by
side
a
fierce
cry
rose
from
conan
lips
as
his
sword
went
up
a
pale
oval
of
a
face
was
turned
toward
him
a
sword
gleamed
in
a
hand
and
beloso
echoed
the
cry
and
then
the
weary
stallion
with
a
lurch
and
a
groan
missed
his
footing
in
the
shadows
and
went
heels
over
head
hurling
his
dazed
rider
from
the
saddle
conan
throbbing
head
crashed
against
a
stone
and
the
stars
were
blotted
out
in
a
thicker
night
how
long
conan
lay
senseless
he
never
knew
his
first
sensation
of
returning
consciousness
was
that
of
being
dragged
by
one
arm
over
rough
and
stony
ground
and
through
dense
underbrush
then
he
was
thrown
carelessly
down
and
perhaps
the
jolt
brought
back
his
senses
his
helmet
was
gone
his
head
ached
abominably
he
felt
a
qualm
of
nausea
and
blood
was
clotted
thickly
among
his
black
locks
but
with
the
vitality
of
a
wild
thing
life
and
consciousness
surged
back
into
him
and
he
became
aware
of
his
surroundings
a
broad
red
moon
was
shining
through
the
trees
by
which
he
knew
that
it
was
long
after
midnight
he
had
lain
senseless
for
hours
long
enough
to
have
recovered
from
that
terrible
blow
beloso
had
dealt
him
as
well
as
the
fall
which
had
rendered
him
senseless
his
brain
felt
clearer
than
it
had
felt
during
that
mad
ride
after
the
fugitive
he
was
not
lying
beside
the
white
road
he
noticed
with
a
start
of
surprise
as
his
surroundings
began
to
record
themselves
on
his
perceptions
the
road
was
nowhere
in
sight
he
lay
on
the
grassy
earth
in
a
small
glade
hemmed
in
by
a
black
wall
of
tree
stems
and
tangled
branches
his
face
and
hands
were
scratched
and
lacerated
as
if
he
had
been
dragged
through
brambles
shifting
his
body
he
looked
about
him
and
then
he
started
violently
something
was
squatting
over
him
at
first
conan
doubted
his
consciousness
thought
it
was
but
a
figment
of
delirium
surely
it
could
not
be
real
that
strange
motionless
gray
being
that
squatted
on
its
haunches
and
stared
down
at
him
with
unblinking
soulless
eyes
conan
lay
and
stared
half
expecting
it
to
vanish
like
a
figure
of
a
dream
and
then
a
chill
of
recollection
crept
along
his
spine
memories
surged
back
of
grisly
tales
whispered
of
the
shapes
that
haunted
these
uninhabited
forests
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
that
mark
the
border
ghouls
men
called
them
eaters
of
human
flesh
spawn
of
darkness
children
of
unholy
matings
of
a
lost
and
forgotten
race
with
the
demons
of
the
underworld
somewhere
in
these
primitive
forests
were
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
accursed
city
men
whispered
and
among
its
tombs
slunk
gray
anthropomorphic
shadows
conan
shuddered
strongly
he
lay
staring
at
the
malformed
head
that
rose
dimly
above
him
and
cautiously
he
extended
a
hand
toward
the
sword
at
his
hip
with
a
horrible
cry
that
the
man
involuntarily
echoed
the
monster
was
at
his
throat
conan
threw
up
his
right
arm
and
the
jaws
closed
on
it
driving
the
mail
links
into
the
hard
flesh
the
misshapen
yet
hands
clutched
for
his
throat
but
he
evaded
them
with
a
heave
and
roll
of
his
whole
body
at
the
same
time
drawing
his
dagger
with
his
left
hand
they
tumbled
over
and
over
on
the
grass
smiting
and
tearing
the
muscles
coiling
under
that
gray
skin
were
stringy
and
hard
as
steel
wires
exceeding
the
strength
of
a
man
but
conan
thews
were
iron
too
and
his
mail
saved
him
from
the
gnashing
fangs
and
ripping
claws
long
enough
for
him
to
drive
home
his
dagger
again
and
again
and
again
the
horrible
vitality
of
the
monstrosity
seemed
inexhaustible
and
the
king
skin
crawled
at
the
feel
of
that
slick
clammy
flesh
he
put
all
his
loathing
and
savage
revulsion
behind
the
plunging
blade
and
suddenly
the
monster
heaved
up
convulsively
beneath
him
as
the
point
found
its
grisly
heart
and
then
lay
still
conan
rose
shaken
with
nausea
he
stood
in
the
center
of
the
glade
uncertainly
sword
in
one
hand
and
dagger
in
the
other
he
had
not
lost
his
instinctive
sense
of
direction
as
far
as
the
points
of
the
compass
were
concerned
but
he
did
not
know
in
which
direction
the
road
lay
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
in
which
direction
the
ghoul
had
dragged
him
conan
glared
at
the
silent
black
woods
which
ringed
him
and
felt
cold
moisture
bead
his
flesh
he
was
without
a
horse
and
lost
in
these
haunted
woods
and
that
staring
deformed
thing
at
his
feet
was
a
mute
evidence
of
the
horrors
that
lurked
in
the
forest
he
stood
almost
holding
his
breath
in
his
painful
intensity
straining
his
ears
for
some
crack
of
twig
or
rustle
of
grass
when
a
sound
did
come
he
started
violently
suddenly
out
on
the
night
air
broke
the
scream
of
a
terrified
horse
his
stallion
there
were
panthers
in
the
wood
or
ghouls
ate
beasts
as
well
as
men
he
broke
savagely
through
the
brush
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
whistling
shrilly
as
he
ran
his
fear
drowned
in
berserk
rage
if
his
horse
was
killed
there
went
his
last
chance
of
following
beloso
and
recovering
the
jewel
again
the
stallion
screamed
with
fear
and
fury
somewhere
nearer
there
was
a
sound
of
lashing
heels
and
something
that
was
struck
heavily
and
gave
way
conan
burst
out
into
the
wide
white
road
without
warning
and
saw
the
stallion
plunging
and
rearing
in
the
moonlight
his
ears
laid
back
his
eyes
and
teeth
flashing
wickedly
he
lashed
out
with
his
heels
at
a
slinking
shadow
that
ducked
and
bobbed
about
him
and
then
about
conan
other
shadows
moved
gray
furtive
shadows
that
closed
in
on
all
sides
a
hideous
scent
reeked
up
in
the
night
air
with
a
curse
the
king
hewed
right
and
left
with
his
broadsword
thrust
and
ripped
with
his
dagger
dripping
fangs
flashed
in
the
moonlight
foul
paws
caught
at
him
but
he
hacked
his
way
through
to
the
stallion
caught
the
rein
leaped
into
the
saddle
his
sword
rose
and
fell
a
frosty
arc
in
the
moonlight
showering
blood
as
it
split
misshapen
heads
clove
shambling
bodies
the
stallion
reared
biting
and
kicking
they
burst
through
and
thundered
down
the
road
on
either
hand
for
a
short
space
flitted
gray
abhorrent
shadows
then
these
fell
behind
and
conan
topping
a
wooded
crest
saw
a
vast
expanse
of
bare
slopes
sweeping
up
and
away
before
him
ghost
out
of
the
soon
after
sunrise
conan
crossed
the
argossean
border
of
beloso
he
had
seen
no
trace
either
the
captain
had
made
good
his
escape
while
the
king
lay
senseless
or
had
fallen
prey
to
the
grim
of
the
zingaran
forest
but
conan
had
seen
no
signs
to
indicate
the
latter
possibility
the
fact
that
he
had
lain
unmolested
for
so
long
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
monsters
had
been
engrossed
in
futile
pursuit
of
the
captain
and
if
the
man
lived
conan
felt
certain
that
he
was
riding
along
the
road
somewhere
ahead
of
him
unless
he
had
intended
going
into
argos
he
would
never
have
taken
the
eastward
road
in
the
first
place
the
helmeted
guards
at
the
frontier
did
not
question
the
cimmerian
a
single
wandering
mercenary
required
no
passport
nor
especially
when
his
unadorned
mail
showed
him
to
be
in
the
service
of
no
lord
through
the
low
grassy
hills
where
streams
murmured
and
oak
groves
dappled
the
sward
with
lights
and
shadows
he
rode
following
the
long
road
that
rose
and
fell
away
ahead
of
him
over
dales
and
rises
in
the
blue
distance
it
was
an
old
old
road
this
highway
from
poitain
to
the
sea
argos
was
at
peace
laden
rumbled
along
the
road
and
men
with
bare
brown
brawny
arms
toiled
in
orchards
and
fields
that
smiled
away
under
the
branches
of
the
roadside
trees
old
men
on
settles
before
inns
under
spreading
oak
branches
called
greetings
to
the
wayfarer
from
the
men
that
worked
the
fields
from
the
garrulous
old
men
in
the
inns
where
he
slaked
his
thirst
with
great
leathern
jacks
of
foaming
ale
from
the
merchants
he
met
upon
the
road
conan
sought
for
news
of
beloso
stories
were
conflicting
but
this
much
conan
learned
that
a
lean
wiry
zingaran
with
the
dangerous
black
eyes
and
mustaches
of
the
western
folk
was
somewhere
on
the
road
ahead
of
him
and
apparently
making
for
messantia
it
was
a
logical
destination
all
the
of
argos
were
cosmopolitan
in
strong
contrast
with
the
inland
provinces
and
messantia
was
the
most
polyglot
of
all
craft
of
all
the
maritime
nations
rode
in
its
harbor
and
refugees
and
fugitives
from
many
lands
gathered
there
laws
were
lax
for
messantia
thrived
on
the
trade
of
the
sea
and
her
citizens
found
it
profitable
to
be
somewhat
blind
on
their
dealings
with
seamen
it
was
not
only
legitimate
trade
that
flowed
into
messantia
smugglers
and
buccaneers
played
their
part
all
this
conan
knew
well
for
had
he
not
in
the
days
of
old
when
he
was
a
barachan
pirate
sailed
by
night
into
the
harbor
of
messantia
to
discharge
strange
cargoes
most
of
the
pirates
of
the
barachan
isles
small
islands
off
the
southwestern
coast
of
zingara
were
argossean
sailors
and
as
long
as
they
confined
their
attentions
to
the
shipping
of
other
nations
the
authorities
of
argos
were
not
too
strict
in
their
interpretation
of
but
conan
had
not
limited
his
activities
to
those
of
the
barachans
he
had
also
sailed
with
the
zingaran
buccaneers
and
even
with
those
wild
black
corsairs
that
swept
up
from
the
far
south
to
harry
the
northern
coasts
and
this
put
him
beyond
the
pale
of
any
law
if
he
were
recognized
in
any
of
the
ports
of
argos
it
would
cost
him
his
head
but
without
hesitation
he
rode
on
to
messantia
halting
day
or
night
only
to
rest
the
stallion
and
to
snatch
a
few
winks
of
sleep
for
himself
he
entered
the
city
unquestioned
merging
himself
with
the
throngs
that
poured
continually
in
and
out
of
this
great
commercial
center
no
walls
surrounded
messantia
the
sea
and
the
ships
of
the
sea
guarded
the
great
southern
trading
city
it
was
evening
when
conan
rode
leisurely
through
the
streets
that
marched
down
to
the
waterfront
at
the
ends
of
these
streets
he
saw
the
wharves
and
the
masts
and
sails
of
ships
he
smelled
salt
water
for
the
first
time
in
years
heard
the
thrum
of
cordage
and
the
creak
of
spars
in
the
breeze
that
was
kicking
up
whitecaps
out
beyond
the
headlands
again
the
urge
of
far
wandering
tugged
at
his
heart
but
he
did
not
go
on
to
the
wharves
he
reined
aside
and
rode
up
a
steep
flight
of
wide
worn
stone
steps
to
a
broad
street
where
ornate
white
mansions
overlooked
the
waterfront
and
the
harbor
below
here
dwelt
the
men
who
had
grown
rich
from
the
fat
of
the
seas
a
few
old
who
had
found
treasure
afar
many
traders
and
merchants
who
never
trod
the
naked
decks
nor
knew
the
roar
of
tempest
or
conan
turned
in
his
horse
at
a
certain
gate
and
rode
into
a
court
where
a
fountain
tinkled
and
pigeons
fluttered
from
marble
coping
to
marble
flagging
a
page
in
jagged
silken
jupon
and
hose
came
forward
inquiringly
the
merchants
of
messantia
dealt
with
many
strange
and
rough
characters
but
most
of
these
smacked
of
the
sea
it
was
strange
that
a
mercenary
trooper
should
so
freely
ride
into
the
court
of
a
lord
of
commerce
merchant
publio
dwells
here
it
was
more
statement
than
question
and
something
in
the
timbre
of
the
voice
caused
the
page
to
doff
his
feather
chaperon
as
he
bowed
and
replied
so
he
does
my
captain
conan
dismounted
and
the
page
called
a
servitor
who
came
running
to
receive
the
stallion
rein
master
is
within
conan
drew
off
his
gauntlets
and
slapped
the
dust
of
the
road
from
cloak
and
mail
my
captain

shall
i
announce
announce
myself
grunted
conan
know
the
way
well
enough
bide
you
here
and
obeying
that
peremptory
command
the
page
stood
still
staring
after
conan
as
the
latter
climbed
a
short
flight
of
marble
steps
and
wondering
what
connection
his
master
might
have
with
this
giant
who
had
the
aspect
of
a
northern
barbarian
menials
at
their
tasks
halted
and
gaped
as
conan
crossed
a
wide
cool
balcony
overlooking
the
court
and
entered
a
broad
corridor
through
which
the
swept
halfway
down
this
he
heard
a
quill
scratching
and
turned
into
a
broad
room
whose
many
wide
casements
overlooked
the
harbor
publio
sat
at
a
carved
teakwood
desk
writing
on
rich
parchment
with
a
golden
quill
he
was
a
short
man
with
a
massive
head
and
quick
dark
eyes
his
blue
robe
was
of
the
finest
watered
silk
trimmed
with
and
from
his
thick
white
throat
hung
a
heavy
gold
chain
as
the
cimmerian
entered
the
merchant
looked
up
with
a
gesture
of
annoyance
he
froze
in
the
midst
of
his
gesture
his
mouth
opened
he
stared
as
at
a
ghost
out
of
the
past
unbelief
and
fear
glimmered
in
his
wide
eyes
said
conan
you
no
word
of
greeting
publio
publio
moistened
his
lips
he
whispered
incredulously
conan
else
the
cimmerian
unclasped
his
cloak
and
threw
it
with
his
gauntlets
down
upon
the
desk
man
he
exclaimed
irritably
you
at
least
offer
me
a
beaker
of
wine
my
throat
caked
with
the
dust
of
the
highway
wine
echoed
publio
mechanically
instinctively
his
hand
reached
for
a
gong
then
recoiled
as
from
a
hot
coal
and
he
shuddered
while
conan
watched
him
with
a
flicker
of
grim
amusement
in
his
eyes
the
merchant
rose
and
hurriedly
shut
the
door
first
craning
his
neck
up
and
down
the
corridor
to
be
sure
that
no
slave
was
loitering
about
then
returning
he
took
a
gold
vessel
of
wine
from
a
table
and
was
about
to
fill
a
slender
goblet
when
conan
impatiently
took
the
vessel
from
him
and
lifting
it
with
both
hands
drank
deep
and
with
gusto
it
conan
right
enough
muttered
publio
are
you
mad
crom
publio
said
conan
lowering
the
vessel
but
retaining
it

his
hands

in
different
quarters

of

it
takes
an
argossean
merchant
to
wring
wealth
out
of
a
little
waterfront
shop
that
stank
of
rotten
fish
and
cheap
wine
old
days
are
past
muttered
publio
drawing
his
robe
about
him
with
a
slight
involuntary
shudder
have
put
off
the
past
like
a
cloak
retorted
conan
ca
put
off
like
an
old
cloak
it
is
much
i
want
of
you
but
that
much
i
do
want
and
you
ca
refuse
me
we
had
too
many
dealings
in
the
old
days
am
i
such
a
fool
that
not

that
this
fine
mansion
was
built
on
my
sweat
and

how
many
cargoes
from
my
galleys
passed
through

conan
grimly

be
silent
ejaculated
publio

starting
out
on
his
brow
his
fingers
jerked
at
the
edge
of
his
robe
i
only
wished
to
recall
it
to
your
mind
answered
conan
be
so
fearful
you
took
plenty
of
risks
in
the
past
when
you
were
struggling
for
life
and
wealth
in
that
lousy
little
shop
down
by
the
wharves
and
were
with
every
buccaneer
and
smuggler

to
the
barachan

prosperity
must
have
softened
you

respectable
began
publio
you
rich
as
hell
snorted
conan
why
did
you
grow
wealthy
so
much
quicker
than
your
competitors
was
it
because
you
did
a
big
business
in
ivory
and
ostrich
feathers
copper
and
skins
and
pearls
and
hammered
gold
ornaments
and
other
things
from
the
coast
of
kush
and
where
did
you
get
them
so
cheaply
while
other
merchants
were
paying
their
weight
in
silver
to
the
stygians
for
them
i
tell
you
in
case
you
forgotten
you
bought
them
from
me
at
considerably
less
than
their
value
and
i
took
them
from
the
tribes
of
the
black
coast
and
from
the
ships
of
the
stygians
i
and
the
black
corsairs
mitra
name
cease
begged
publio
have
not
forgotten
but
what
are
you
doing
here
i
am
the
only
man
in
argos
who
knew
that
the
king
of
aquilonia
was
once
conan
the
buccaneer
in
the
old
days
but
word
has
come
southward
of
the
overthrow
of
aquilonia
and
the
death
of
the
king
enemies
have
killed
me
a
hundred
times
by
rumors
grunted
conan
here
i
sit
and
guzzle
wine
of
kyros
and
he
suited
the
action
to
the
word
lowering
the
vessel
which
was
now
nearly
empty
he
said
but
a
small
thing
i
ask
of
you
publio
i
know
that
you
aware
of
everything
that
goes
on
in
messantia
i
want
to
know
if
a
zingaran
named
beloso
or
he
might
call
himself
anything
is
in
this
city
he
tall
and
lean
and
dark
like
all
his
race
and
it
likely
he
seek
to
sell
a
very
rare
jewel
publio
shook
his
head
have
not
heard
of
such
a
man
but
thousands
come
and
go
in
messantia
if
he
is
here
my
agents
will
discover
him
send
them
to
look
for
him
and
in
the
meantime
have
my
horse
cared
for
and
have
food
served
me
here
in
this
room
publio
assented
volubly
and
conan
emptied
the
wine
vessel
tossed
it
carelessly
into
a
corner
and
strode
to
a
casement
involuntarily
expanding
his
chest
as
he
breathed
deep
of
the
salt
air
he
was
looking
down
upon
the
meandering
waterfront
streets
he
swept
the
ships
in
the
harbor
with
an
appreciative
glance
then
lifted
his
head
and
stared
beyond
the
bay
far
into
the
blue
haze
of
the
distance
where
sea
met
sky
and
his
memory
sped
beyond
that
horizon
to
the
golden
seas
of
the
south
under
flaming
suns
where
laws
were
not
and
life
ran
hotly
some
vagrant
scent
of
spice
or
palm
woke
images
of
strange
coasts
where
mangroves
grew
and
drums
thundered
of
ships
locked
in
battle
and
decks
running
blood
of
smoke
and
flame
and
the
crying
of
slaughter
lost
in
his
thoughts
he
scarcely
noticed
when
publio
stole
from
the
chamber
gathering
up
his
robe
the
merchant
hurried
along
the
corridors
until
he
came
to
a
certain
chamber
where
a
tall
gaunt
man
with
a
scar
upon
his
temple
wrote
continually
upon
parchment
there
was
something
about
this
man
which
made
his
clerkly
occupation
seem
incongruous
to
him
publio
spoke
abruptly
has
returned
the
gaunt
man
started
up
and
the
quill
fell
from
his
fingers
corsair
the
gaunt
man
went
livid
he
mad
if
he
is
discovered
here
we
are
ruined
they
will
hang
a
man
who
shelters
or
trades
with
a
corsair
as
quickly
as
they
hang
the
corsair
himself
what
if
the
governor
should
learn
of
our
past
connections
with
him
will
not
learn
answered
publio
grimly
your
men
into
the
markets
and
wharfside
dives
and
learn
if
one
beloso
a
zingaran
is
in
messantia
conan
said
he
had
a
gem
which
he
will
probably
seek
to
dispose
of
the
jewel
merchants
should
know
of
him
if
any
do
and
here
is
another
task
for
you
pick
up
a
dozen
or
so
desperate
villains
who
can
be
trusted
to
do
away
with
a
man
and
hold
their
tongues
afterward
you
understand
me
understand
the
other
nodded
slowly
and
somberly
have
not
stolen
cheated
lied
and
fought
my
way
up
from
the
gutter
to
be
undone
now
by
a
ghost
out
of
my
past
muttered
publio
and
the
sinister
darkness
of
his
countenance
at
that
moment
would
have
surprised
the
wealthy
nobles
and
ladies
who
bought
their
silks
and
pearls
from
his
many
stalls
but
when
he
returned
to
conan
a
short
time
later
bearing
in
his
own
hands
a
platter
of
fruit
and
meats
he
presented
a
placid
face
to
his
unwelcome
guest
conan
still
stood
at
the
casement
staring
down
into
the
harbor
at
the
purple
and
crimson
and
vermilion
and
scarlet
sails
of
galleons
and
caracks
and
galleys
and
dromonds
a
stygian
galley
if
i
not
blind
he
remarked
pointing
to
a
long
low
slim
black
ship
lying
apart
from
the
others
anchored
off
the
low
broad
sandy
beach
that
curved
round
to
the
distant
headland
there
peace
then
between
stygia
and
argos
same
sort
that
has
existed
before
answered
publio
setting
the
platter
on
the
table
with
a
sigh
of
relief
for
it
was
heavily
laden
he
knew
his
guest
of
old
ports
are
temporarily
open
to
our
ships
as
ours
to
theirs
but
may
no
craft
of
mine
meet
their
cursed
galleys
out
of
sight
of
land
that
galley
crept
into
the
bay
last
night
what
its
masters
wish
i
do
not
know
so
far
they
have
neither
bought
nor
sold
i
distrust
those
devils
treachery
had
its
birth
in
that
dusky
land
made
them
howl
said
conan
carelessly
turning
from
the
window
my
galley
manned
by
black
corsairs
i
crept
to
the
very
bastions
of
the
castles
of
khemi
by
night
and
burned
the
galleons
anchored
there
and
speaking
of
treachery
mine
host
suppose
you
taste
these
viands
and
sip
a
bit
of
this
wine
just
to
show
me
that
your
heart
is
on
the
right
side
publio
complied
so
readily
that
conan
suspicions
were
lulled
and
without
further
hesitation
he
sat
down
and
devoured
enough
for
three
men
and
while
he
ate
men
moved
through
the
markets
and
along
the
waterfront
searching
for
a
zingaran
who
had
a
jewel
to
sell
or
who
sought
for
a
ship
to
carry
him
to
foreign
ports
and
a
tall
gaunt
man
with
a
scar
on
his
temple
sat
with
his
elbows
on
a
table
in
a
squalid
cellar
with
a
brass
lantern
hanging
from
a
beam
overhead
and
held
converse
with
ten
desperate
rogues
whose
sinister
countenances
and
ragged
garments
proclaimed
their
profession
and
as
the
first
stars
blinked
out
they
shone
on
a
strange
band
spurring
their
mounts
along
the
white
road
that
led
to
messantia
from
the
west
they
were
four
men
tall
gaunt
clad
in
black
hooded
robes
and
they
did
not
speak
they
forced
their
steeds
mercilessly
onward
and
those
steeds
were
gaunt
as
themselves
and
and
weary
as
if
from
long
travel
and
far
wandering
the
black
hand
of
set
conan
woke
from
a
sound
sleep
as
quickly
and
instantly
as
a
cat
and
like
a
cat
he
was
on
his
feet
with
his
sword
out
before
the
man
who
had
touched
him
could
so
much
as
draw
back
word
publio
demanded
conan
recognizing
his
host
the
gold
lamp
burned
low
casting
a
mellow
glow
over
the
thick
tapestries
and
the
rich
coverings
of
the
couch
whereon
he
had
been
reposing
publio
recovering
from
the
start
given
him
by
the
sudden
action
of
his
awakening
guest
replied
zingaran
has
been
located
he
arrived
yesterday
at
dawn
only
a
few
hours
ago
he
sought
to
sell
a
huge
strange
jewel
to
a
shemitish
merchant
but
the
shemite
would
have
naught
to
do
with
it
men
say
he
turned
pale
beneath
his
black
beard
at
the
sight
of
it
and
closing
his
stall
fled
as
from
a
thing
accursed
must
be
beloso
muttered
conan
feeling
the
pulse
in
his
temples
pounding
with
impatient
eagerness
is
he
now
sleeps
in
the
house
of
servio
know
that
dive
of
old
grunted
conan
better
hasten
before
some
of
these
waterfront
thieves
cut
his
throat
for
the
jewel
he
took
up
his
cloak
and
flung
it
over
his
shoulders
then
donned
a
helmet
publio
had
procured
for
him
my
steed
saddled
and
ready
in
the
court
said
he
may
return
in
haste
i
shall
not
forget
this
night
work
publio
a
few
moments
later
publio
standing
at
a
small
outer
door
watched
the
king
tall
figure
receding
down
the
shadowy
street
to
you
corsair
muttered
the
merchant
must
be
a
notable
jewel
to
be
sought
by
a
man
who
has
just
lost
a
kingdom
i
wish
i
had
told
my
knaves
to
let
him
secure
it
before
they
did
their
work
but
then
something
might
have
gone
awry
let
argos
forget
amra
and
let
my
dealings
with
him
be
lost
in
the
dust
of
the
past
in
the
alley
behind
the
house
of
servio
that
is
where
conan
will
cease
to
be
a
peril
to
me
servio
house
a
dingy
den
was
located
close
to
the
wharves
facing
the
waterfront
it
was
a
shambling
building
of
stone
and
heavy
and
a
long
narrow
alley
wandered
up
alongside
it
conan
made
his
way
along
the
alley
and
as
he
approached
the
house
he
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
he
was
being
spied
upon
he
stared
hard
into
the
shadows
of
the
squalid
buildings
but
saw
nothing
though
once
he
caught
the
faint
rasp
of
cloth
or
leather
against
flesh
but
that
was
nothing
unusual
thieves
and
beggars
prowled
these
alleys
all
night
and
they
were
not
likely
to
attack
him
after
one
look
at
his
size
and
harness
but
suddenly
a
door
opened
in
the
wall
ahead
of
him
and
he
slipped
into
the
shadow
of
an
arch
a
figure
emerged
from
the
open
door
and
moved
along
the
alley
not
furtively
but
with
a
natural
noiselessness
like
that
of
a
jungle
beast
enough
starlight
filtered
into
the
alley
to
silhouette
the
man
profile
dimly
as
he
passed
the
doorway
where
conan
lurked
the
stranger
was
a
stygian
there
was
no
mistaking
that
shaven
head
even
in
the
starlight
nor
the
mantle
over
the
broad
shoulders
he
passed
on
down
the
alley
in
the
direction
of
the
beach
and
once
conan
thought
he
must
be
carrying
a
lantern
among
his
garments
for
he
caught
a
flash
of
lambent
light
just
as
the
man
vanished
but
the
cimmerian
forgot
the
stranger
as
he
noticed
that
the
door
through
which
he
had
emerged
still
stood
open
conan
had
intended
entering
by
the
main
entrance
and
forcing
servio
to
show
him
the
room
where
the
zingaran
slept
but
if
he
could
get
into
the
house
without
attracting
anyone
attention
so
much
the
better
a
few
long
strides
brought
him
to
the
door
and
as
his
hand
fell
on
the
lock
he
stifled
an
involuntary
grunt
his
practised
fingers
skilled
among
the
thieves
of
zamora
long
ago
told
him
that
the
lock
had
been
forced
apparently
by
some
terrific
pressure
from
the
outside
that
had
twisted
and
bent
the
heavy
iron
bolts
tearing
the
very
sockets
loose
from
the
jambs
how
such
damage
could
have
been
wrought
so
violently
without
awakening
everyone
in
the
neighborhood
conan
could
not
imagine
but
he
felt
sure
that
it
had
been
done
that
night
a
broken
lock
if
discovered
would
not
go
unmended
in
the
house
of
servio
in
this
neighborhood
of
thieves
and
cutthroats
conan
entered
stealthily
poniard
in
hand
wondering
how
he
was
to
find
the
chamber
of
the
zingaran
groping
in
total
darkness
he
halted
suddenly
he
sensed
death
in
that
room
as
a
wild
beast
senses
it
not
as
peril
threatening
him
but
a
dead
thing
something
freshly
slain
in
the
darkness
his
foot
hit
and
recoiled
from
something
heavy
and
yielding
with
a
sudden
premonition
he
groped
along
the
wall
until
he
found
the
shelf
that
supported
the
brass
lamp
with
its
flint
steel
and
tinder
beside
it
a
few
seconds
later
a
flickering
uncertain
light
sprang
up
and
he
stared
narrowly
about
him
a
bunk
built
against
the
rough
stone
wall
a
bare
table
and
a
bench
completed
the
furnishings
of
the
squalid
chamber
an
inner
door
stood
closed
and
bolted
and
on
the
dirt
floor
lay
beloso
on
his
back
he
lay
with
his
head
drawn
back
between
his
shoulders
so
that
he
seemed
to
stare
with
his
wide
glassy
eyes
at
the
sooty
beams
of
the
cobwebbed
ceiling
his
lips
were
drawn
back
from
his
teeth
in
a
frozen
grin
of
agony
his
sword
lay
near
him
still
in
its
scabbard
his
shirt
was
torn
open
and
on
his
brown
muscular
breast
was
the
print
of
a
black
hand
thumb
and
four
fingers
plainly
distinct
conan
glared
in
silence
feeling
the
short
hairs
bristle
at
the
back
of
his
neck
he
muttered
black
hand
of
set
he
had
seen
that
mark
of
old
the
of
the
black
priests
of
set
the
grim
cult
that
ruled
in
dark
stygia
and
suddenly
he
remembered
that
curious
flash
he
had
seen
emanating
from
the
mysterious
stygian
who
had
emerged
from
this
chamber
heart
by
crom
he
muttered
was
carrying
it
under
his
mantle
he
stole
it
he
burst
that
door
by
his
magic
and
slew
beloso
he
was
a
priest
of
set
a
quick
investigation
confirmed
at
least
part
of
his
suspicions
the
jewel
was
not
on
the
zingaran
body
an
uneasy
feeling
rose
in
conan
that
this
had
not
happened
by
chance
or
without
design
a
conviction
that
the
mysterious
stygian
galley
had
come
into
the
harbor
of
messantia
on
a
definite
mission
how
could
the
priests
of
set
know
that
the
heart
had
come
southward
yet
the
thought
was
no
more
fantastic
than
the
necromancy
that
could
slay
an
armed
man
by
the
touch
of
an
open
empty
hand
a
stealthy
footfall
outside
the
door
brought
him
round
like
a
great
cat
with
one
motion
he
extinguished
the
lamp
and
drew
his
sword
his
ears
told
him
that
men
were
out
there
in
the
darkness
were
closing
in
on
the
doorway
as
his
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
sudden
darkness
he
could
make
out
dim
figures
ringing
the
entrance
he
could
not
guess
their
identity
but
as
always
he
took
the
initiative
leaping
suddenly
forth
from
the
doorway
without
awaiting
the
attack
his
unexpected
movement
took
the
skulkers
by
surprise
he
sensed
and
heard
men
close
about
him
saw
a
dim
masked
figure
in
the
starlight
before
him
then
his
sword
crunched
home
and
he
was
fleeting
away
down
the
alley
before
the
and
attackers
could
intercept
him
as
he
ran
he
heard
somewhere
ahead
of
him
a
faint
creak
of
and
he
forgot
the
men
behind
him
a
boat
was
moving
out
into
the
bay
gritting
his
teeth
he
increased
his
speed
but
before
he
reached
the
beach
he
heard
the
rasp
and
creak
of
ropes
and
the
grind
of
the
great
sweep
in
its
socket
thick
clouds
rolling
up
from
the
sea
obscured
the
stars
in
thick
darkness
conan
came
upon
the
strand
straining
his
eyes
out
across
the
black
restless
water
something
was
moving
out
there
a
long
low
black
shape
that
receded
in
the
darkness
gathering
momentum
as
it
went
to
his
ears
came
the
rhythmical
clack
of
long
oars
he
ground
his
teeth
in
helpless
fury
it
was
the
stygian
galley
and
she
was
racing
out
to
sea
bearing
with
her
the
jewel
that
meant
to
him
the
throne
of
aquilonia
with
a
savage
curse
he
took
a
step
toward
the
waves
that
lapped
against
the
sands
catching
at
his
hauberk
and
intending
to
rip
it
off
and
swim
after
the
vanishing
ship
then
the
crunch
of
a
heel
in
the
sand
brought
him
about
he
had
forgotten
his
pursuers
dark
figures
closed
in
on
him
with
a
rush
of
feet
through
the
sands
the
first
went
down
beneath
the
cimmerian
flailing
sword
but
the
others
did
not
falter
blades
whickered
dimly
about
him
in
the
darkness
or
rasped
on
his
mail
blood
and
entrails
spilled
over
his
hand
and
someone
screamed
as
he
ripped
murderously
upward
a
muttered
voice
spurred
on
the
attack
and
that
voice
sounded
vaguely
familiar
conan
plowed
through
the
clinging
hacking
shapes
toward
the
voice
a
faint
light
gleaming
momentarily
through
the
drifting
clouds
showed
him
a
tall
gaunt
man
with
a
great
livid
scar
on
his
temple
conan
sword
sheared
through
his
skull
as
through
a
ripe
melon
then
an
ax
swung
blindly
in
the
dark
crashed
on
the
king
basinet
filling
his
eyes
with
sparks
of
fire
he
lurched
and
lunged
felt
his
sword
sink
deep
and
heard
a
shriek
of
agony
then
he
stumbled
over
a
corpse
and
a
bludgeon
knocked
the
dented
helmet
from
his
head
the
next
instant
the
club
fell
full
on
his
unprotected
skull
the
king
of
aquilonia
crumpled
into
the
wet
sands
over
him
wolfish
figures
panted
in
the
gloom
off
his
head
muttered
one
him
lie
grunted
another
me
tie
up
my
wounds
before
i
bleed
to
death
the
tide
will
wash
him
into
the
bay
see
he
fell
at
the
water
edge
his
skull
split
no
man
could
live
after
such
blows
me
strip
him
urged
another
harness
will
fetch
a
few
pieces
of
silver
and
haste
tiberio
is
dead
and
i
hear
seamen
singing
as
they
reel
along
the
strand
let
us
be
gone
there
followed
hurried
activity
in
the
darkness
and
then
the
sound
of
quickly
receding
footsteps
the
tipsy
singing
of
the
seamen
grew
louder
in
his
chamber
publio
nervously
pacing
back
and
forth
before
a
window
that
overlooked
the
shadowed
bay
whirled
suddenly
his
nerves
tingling
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
the
door
had
been
bolted
from
within
but
now
it
stood
open
and
four
men
filed
into
the
chamber
at
the
sight
of
them
his
flesh
crawled
many
strange
beings
publio
had
seen
in
his
lifetime
but
none
before
like
these
they
were
tall
and
gaunt
and
their
faces
were
dim
yellow
ovals
in
the
shadows
of
their
coifs
he
could
not
tell
much
about
their
features
and
was
unreasoningly
glad
that
he
could
not
each
bore
a
long
curiously
mottled
staff
are
you
he
demanded
and
his
voice
sounded
brittle
and
hollow
do
you
wish
here
is
conan
he
who
was
king
of
aquilonia
demanded
the
tallest
of
the
four
in
a
passionless
monotone
that
made
publio
shudder
it
was
like
the
hollow
tone
of
a
khitan
temple
bell
do
not
know
what
you
mean
stammered
the
merchant
his
customary
poise
shaken
by
the
uncanny
aspect
of
his
visitors
know
no
such
man
has
been
here
returned
the
other
with
no
change
of
inflection
horse
is
in
the
courtyard
tell
us
where
he
is
before
we
do
you
an
injury
shouted
publio
frantically
recoiling
until
he
crouched
against
the
wall
the
four
khitans
watched
him
without
emotion
or
change
of
expression
you
summon
your
slave
he
will
die
warned
one
of
them
which
only
served
to
terrify
publio
more
than
ever
he
screamed
are
you
curse
you
thieves
are
murdering
your
master
swift
footsteps
padded
in
the
corridor
outside
and
gebal
burst
into
the
chamber
a
shemite
of
medium
height
and
mightily
muscled
build
his
curled
beard
bristling
and
a
short
sword
in
his
hand
he
stared
in
stupid
amazement
at
the
four
invaders
unable
to
understand
their
presence
dimly
remembering
that
he
had
drowsed
unexplainably
on
the
stair
he
was
guarding
and
up
which
they
must
have
come
he
had
never
slept
on
duty
before
but
his
master
was
shrieking
with
a
note
of
hysteria
in
his
voice
and
the
shemite
drove
like
a
bull
at
the
strangers
his
thickly
muscled
arm
drawing
back
for
the
disemboweling
thrust
but
the
stroke
was
never
dealt
a
arm
shot
out
extending
the
long
staff
its
end
but
touched
the
shemite
brawny
breast
and
was
instantly
withdrawn
the
stroke
was
horribly
like
the
dart
and
recovery
of
a
serpent
head
gebal
halted
short
in
his
headlong
plunge
as
if
he
had
encountered
a
solid
barrier
his
bull
head
toppled
forward
on
his
breast
the
sword
slipped
from
his
fingers
and
then
he
melted
slowly
to
the
floor
it
was
as
if
all
the
bones
of
his
frame
had
suddenly
become
flabby
publio
turned
sick
not
shout
again
advised
the
tallest
khitan
servants
sleep
soundly
but
if
you
awaken
them
they
will
die
and
you
with
them
where
is
conan
is
gone
to
the
house
of
servio
near
the
waterfront
to
search
for
the
zingaran
beloso
gasped
publio
all
his
power
of
resistance
gone
out
of
him
the
merchant
did
not
lack
courage
but
these
uncanny
visitants
turned
his
marrow
to
water
he
started
convulsively
at
a
sudden
noise
of
footsteps
hurrying
up
the
stair
outside
loud
in
the
ominous
stillness
servant
asked
the
khitan
publio
shook
his
head
mutely
his
tongue
frozen
to
his
palate
he
could
not
speak
one
of
the
khitans
caught
up
a
silken
cover
from
a
couch
and
threw
it
over
the
corpse
then
they
melted
behind
the
tapestry
but
before
the
tallest
man
disappeared
he
murmured
to
this
man
who
comes
and
send
him
away
quickly
if
you
betray
us
neither
he
nor
you
will
live
to
reach
that
door
make
no
sign
to
show
him
you
are
not
alone
and
lifting
his
staff
suggestively
the
yellow
man
faded
behind
the
hangings
publio
shuddered
and
choked
down
a
desire
to
retch
it
might
have
been
a
trick
of
the
light
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
occasionally
those
staffs
moved
slightly
of
their
own
accord
as
if
possessed
of
an
unspeakable
life
of
their
own
he
pulled
himself
together
with
a
mighty
effort
and
presented
a
composed
aspect
to
the
ragged
ruffian
who
burst
into
the
chamber
have
done
as
you
wished
my
lord
this
man
exclaimed
barbarian
lies
dead
on
the
sands
at
the
water
edge
publio
felt
a
movement
in
the
arras
behind
him
and
almost
burst
from
fright
the
man
swept
heedlessly
on
secretary
tiberio
is
dead
the
barbarian
slew
him
and
four
of
my
companions
we
bore
their
bodies
to
the
rendezvous
there
was
nothing
of
value
on
the
barbarian
except
a
few
silver
coins
are
there
any
further
orders
gasped
publio
white
about
the
lips
the
desperado
bowed
and
hurried
out
with
a
vague
feeling
that
publio
was
both
a
man
of
weak
stomach
and
few
words
the
four
khitans
came
from
behind
the
arras
whom
did
this
man
speak
the
taller
demanded
a
wandering
stranger
who
did
me
an
injury
panted
publio
lie
said
the
khitan
calmly
spoke
of
the
king
of
aquilonia
i
read
it
in
your
expression
sit
upon
that
divan
and
do
not
move
or
speak
i
will
remain
with
you
while
my
three
companions
go
search
for
the
body
so
publio
sat
and
shook
with
terror
of
the
silent
inscrutable
figure
which
watched
him
until
the
three
khitans
filed
back
into
the
room
with
the
news
that
conan
body
did
not
lie
upon
the
sands
publio
did
not
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
found
the
spot
where
the
fight
was
fought
they
said
was
on
the
sand
but
the
king
was
gone
the
fourth
khitan
drew
imaginary
symbols
upon
the
carpet
with
his
staff
which
glistened
scalily
in
the
lamplight
you
read
naught
from
the
sands
he
asked
they
answered
king
lives
and
he
has
gone
southward
in
a
ship
the
tall
khitan
lifted
his
head
and
gazed
at
publio
so
that
the
merchant
broke
into
a
profuse
sweat
do
you
wish
of
me
he
stuttered
ship
answered
the
khitan
ship
well
manned
for
a
very
long
voyage
how
long
a
voyage
stammered
publio
never
thinking
of
refusing
the
ends
of
the
world
perhaps
answered
the
khitan
to
the
molten
seas
of
hell
that
lie
beyond
the
sunrise
the
return
of
the
corsair
conan
first
sensation
of
returning
consciousness
was
that
of
motion
under
him
was
no
solidity
but
a
ceaseless
heaving
and
plunging
then
he
heard
wind
humming
through
cords
and
spars
and
knew
he
was
aboard
a
ship
even
before
his
blurred
sight
cleared
he
heard
a
mutter
of
voices
and
then
a
dash
of
water
deluged
him
jerking
him
sharply
into
full
animation
he
heaved
up
with
a
sulphurous
curse
braced
his
legs
and
glared
about
him
with
a
burst
of
coarse
guffaws
in
his
ears
and
the
reek
of
unwashed
bodies
in
his
nostrils
he
was
standing
on
the
poopdeck
of
a
long
galley
which
was
running
before
the
wind
that
whipped
down
from
the
north
her
striped
sail
bellying
against
the
taut
sheets
the
sun
was
just
rising
in
a
dazzling
blaze
of
gold
and
blue
and
green
to
the
left
of
the
shoreline
was
a
dim
purple
shadow
to
the
right
stretched
the
open
ocean
this
much
conan
saw
at
a
glance
that
likewise
included
the
ship
itself
it
was
long
and
narrow
a
typical
of
the
southern
coasts
high
of
poop
and
stern
with
cabins
at
either
extremity
conan
looked
down
into
the
open
waist
whence
wafted
that
sickening
abominable
odor
he
knew
it
of
old
it
was
the
of
the
oarsmen
chained
to
their
benches
they
were
all
negroes
forty
men
to
each
side
each
confined
by
a
chain
locked
about
his
waist
with
the
other
end
welded
to
a
heavy
ring
set
deep
in
the
solid
runway
beam
that
ran
between
the
benches
from
stem
to
stern
the
life
of
a
slave
aboard
an
argossean
galley
was
a
hell
unfathomable
most
of
these
were
kushites
but
some
thirty
of
the
blacks
who
now
rested
on
their
idle
oars
and
stared
up
at
the
stranger
with
dull
curiosity
were
from
the
far
southern
isles
the
homelands
of
the
corsairs
conan
recognized
them
by
their
straighter
features
and
hair
their
rangier
build
and
he
saw
among
them
men
who
had
followed
him
of
old
but
all
this
he
saw
and
recognized
in
one
swift
glance
as
he
rose
before
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
figures
about
him
reeling
momentarily
on
braced
legs
his
fists
clenched
wrathfully
he
glared
at
the
figures
clustered
about
him
the
sailor
who
had
drenched
him
stood
grinning
the
empty
bucket
still
poised
in
his
hand
and
conan
cursed
him
with
venom
instinctively
reaching
for
his
hilt
then
he
discovered
that
he
was
weaponless
and
naked
except
for
his
short
leather
breeks
lousy
tub
is
this
he
roared
did
i
come
aboard
here
the
sailors
laughed
jeeringly
stocky
bearded
argosseans
to
a
man
and
one
whose
richer
dress
and
air
of
command
proclaimed
him
captain
folded
his
arms
and
said
domineeringly
found
you
lying
on
the
sands
somebody
had
rapped
you
on
the
pate
and
taken
your
clothes
needing
an
extra
man
we
brought
you
aboard
ship
is
this
conan
demanded
out
of
messantia
with
a
cargo
of
mirrors
scarlet
silk
cloaks
shields
gilded
helmets
and
swords

captain
of
this
vessel
and
your
master
henceforward
i
headed
in
the
direction
i
wanted
to
go
after
all
muttered
conan
heedless
of
that
last
remark
they
were
racing
southeastward
following
the
long
curve
of
the
argossean
coast
these
never
ventured
far
from
the
shoreline
somewhere
ahead
of
him
he
knew
that
low
dark
stygian
galley
was
speeding
southward
you
sighted
a
stygian
galley
began
conan
but
the
beard
of
the
burly
captain
bristled
he
was
not
in
the
least
interested
in
any
question
his
prisoner
might
wish
to
ask
and
felt
it
high
time
he
reduced
this
independent
wastrel
to
his
proper
place
he
roared
wasted
time
enough
with
you
i
done
you
the
honor
of
having
you
brought
to
the
poop
to
be
revived
and
answered
enough
of
your
infernal
questions
get
off
this
poop
work
your
way
aboard
this
galley
buy
your
ship
began
conan
before
he
remembered
that
he
was
a
penniless
wanderer
a
roar
of
rough
mirth
greeted
these
words
and
the
captain
turned
purple
thinking
he
sensed
ridicule
mutinous
swine
he
bellowed
taking
a
threatening
step
forward
while
his
hand
closed
on
the
knife
at
his
belt
before
i
have
you
flogged
you
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
your
jaws
or
by
mitra
i
have
you
chained
among
the
blacks
to
tug
an
oar
conan
volcanic
temper
never
long
at
best
burst
into
explosion
not
in
years
even
before
he
was
king
had
a
man
spoken
to
him
thus
and
lived
lift
your
voice
to
me
you
dog
he
roared
in
a
voice
as
gusty
as
the
while
the
sailors
gaped
dumfounded
that
toy
and
i
feed
you
to
the
fishes
do
you
think
you
are
gasped
the
captain
show
you
roared
the
maddened
cimmerian
and
he
wheeled
and
bounded
toward
the
rail
where
weapons
hung
in
their
brackets
the
captain
drew
his
knife
and
ran
at
him
bellowing
but
before
he
could
strike
conan
gripped
his
wrist
with
a
wrench
that
tore
the
arm
clean
out
of
the
socket
the
captain
bellowed
like
an
ox
in
agony
and
then
rolled
clear
across
the
deck
as
he
was
hurled
contemptuously
from
his
attacker
conan
ripped
a
heavy
ax
from
the
rail
and
wheeled
to
meet
the
rush
of
the
sailors
they
ran
in
giving
tongue
like
hounds
and
awkward
in
comparison
to
the
pantherish
cimmerian
before
they
could
reach
him
with
their
knives
he
sprang
among
them
striking
right
and
left
too
quickly
for
the
eye
to
follow
and
blood
and
brains
spattered
as
two
corpses
struck
the
deck
knives
flailed
the
air
wildly
as
conan
broke
through
the
stumbling
gasping
mob
and
bounded
to
the
narrow
bridge
that
spanned
the
waist
from
poop
to
forecastle
just
out
of
reach
of
the
slaves
below
behind
him
the
handful
of
sailors
on
the
poop
were
floundering
after
him
daunted
by
the
destruction
of
their
fellows
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
some
thirty
in
all
came
running
across
the
bridge
toward
him
with
weapons
in
their
hands
conan
bounded
out
on
the
bridge
and
stood
poised
above
the
upturned
black
faces
ax
lifted
black
mane
blown
in
the
wind
am
i
he
yelled
you
dogs
look
ajonga
yasunga
laranga
am
i
and
from
the
waist
rose
a
shout
that
swelled
to
a
mighty
roar
it
is
amra
the
lion
has
returned
the
sailors
who
caught
and
understood
the
burden
of
that
awesome
shout
paled
and
shrank
back
staring
in
sudden
fear
at
the
wild
figure
on
the
bridge
was
this
in
truth
that
ogre
of
the
southern
seas
who
had
so
mysteriously
vanished
years
ago
but
who
still
lived
in
gory
legends
the
blacks
were
frothing
crazy
now
shaking
and
tearing
at
their
chains
and
shrieking
the
name
of
amra
like
an
invocation
kushites
who
had
never
seen
conan
before
took
up
the
yell
the
slaves
in
the
pen
under
the
began
to
batter
at
the
walls
shrieking
like
the
damned
demetrio
hitching
himself
along
the
deck
on
one
hand
and
his
knees
livid
with
the
agony
of
his
dislocated
arm
screamed
and
kill
him
dogs
before
the
slaves
break
loose
fired
to
desperation
by
that
word
the
most
dread
to
all
galleymen
the
sailors
charged
on
to
the
bridge
from
both
ends
but
with
a
bound
conan
left
the
bridge
and
hit
like
a
cat
on
his
feet
on
the
runway
between
the
benches
to
the
masters
he
thundered
and
his
ax
rose
and
fell
crashingly
full
on
a
severing
it
like
matchwood
in
an
instant
a
shrieking
slave
was
free
splintering
his
oar
for
a
bludgeon
men
were
racing
frantically
along
the
bridge
above
and
all
hell
and
bedlam
broke
loose
on
the
conan
ax
rose
and
fell
without
pause
and
with
every
stroke
a
frothing
screaming
black
giant
broke
free
mad
with
hate
and
the
fury
of
freedom
and
vengeance
sailors
leaping
down
into
the
waist
to
grapple
or
smite
at
the
naked
white
giant
hewing
like
one
possessed
at
the
shackles
found
themselves
dragged
down
by
the
hands
of
slaves
yet
unfreed
while
others
their
broken
chains
whipping
and
snapping
about
their
limbs
came
up
out
of
the
waist
like
a
blind
black
torrent
screaming
like
fiends
smiting
with
broken
oars
and
pieces
of
iron
tearing
and
rending
with
talons
and
teeth
in
the
midst
of
the
mêlée
the
slaves
in
the
pen
broke
down
the
walls
and
came
surging
up
on
the
decks
and
with
fifty
blacks
freed
of
their
benches
conan
abandoned
his
and
bounded
up
on
the
bridge
to
add
his
notched
ax
to
the
bludgeons
of
his
partisans
then
it
was
massacre
the
argosseans
were
strong
sturdy
fearless
like
all
their
race
trained
in
the
brutal
school
of
the
sea
but
they
could
not
stand
against
these
maddened
giants
led
by
the
tigerish
barbarian
blows
and
abuse
and
hellish
suffering
were
avenged
in
one
red
gust
of
fury
that
raged
like
a
typhoon
from
one
end
of
the
ship
to
the
other
and
when
it
had
blown
itself
out
but
one
white
man
lived
aboard
the
and
that
was
the
giant
about
whom
the
chanting
blacks
thronged
to
cast
themselves
prostrate
on
the
bloody
deck
and
beat
their
heads
against
the
boards
in
an
ecstasy
of
conan
his
mighty
chest
heaving
and
glistening
with
sweat
the
red
ax
gripped
in
his
hand
glared
about
him
as
the
first
chief
of
men
might
have
glared
in
some
primordial
dawn
and
shook
back
his
black
mane
in
that
moment
he
was
not
king
of
aquilonia
he
was
again
lord
of
the
black
corsairs
who
had
hacked
his
way
to
lordship
through
flame
and
blood
amra
chanted
the
delirious
blacks
those
who
were
left
to
chant
lion
has
returned
now
will
the
stygians
howl
like
dogs
in
the
night
and
the
black
dogs
of
kush
will
howl
now
will
villages
burst
in
flames
and
ships
founder
aie
there
will
be
wailing
of
women
and
the
thunder
of
the
spears
this
yammering
dogs
conan
roared
in
a
voice
that
drowned
the
clap
of
the
sail
in
the
wind
of
you
go
below
and
free
the
oarsmen
who
are
yet
chained
the
rest

you

argosseans
throw
these
carcasses
overboard
jump
to
it
you
rogues
or
i
notch
your
hides
for
you
with
shouts
and
laughter
and
wild
singing
they
leaped
to
do
his
commands
the
corpses
white
and
black
were
hurled
overboard
where
triangular
fins
were
already
cutting
the
water
conan
stood
on
the
poop
frowning
down
at
the
black
men
who
watched
him
expectantly
his
heavy
brown
arms
were
folded
his
black
hair
grown
long
in
his
wanderings
blew
in
the
wind
a
wilder
and
more
barbaric
figure
never
trod
the
bridge
of
a
ship
and
in
this
ferocious
corsair
few
of
the
courtiers
of
aquilonia
would
have
recognized
their
king

in
the
hold
he
roared
in
plenty
for
you
for

blades
and
harness

the

who
dwell
along
the
coast
there
are
enough
of

and
to

you

for

they
roared

us
where
you
will
fall
to
and
clean
out
that
waist
he
commanded

in
such
filth

of
you
come
with
me
and
break
out
food
from
the
by
crom
i
pad
out
your
ribs
before
this
cruise
is
done
another
yell
of
approbation
answered
him
as
the
blacks
scurried
to
do
his
bidding
the
sail
bellied
as
the
wind
swept
over
the
waves
with
renewed
force
and
the
white
crests
danced
along
the
sweep
of
the
wind
conan
planted
his
feet
to
the
heave
of
the
deck
breathed
deep
and
spread
his
mighty
arms
king
of
aquilonia
he
might
no
longer
be
king
of
the
blue
ocean
he
was
still
khemi
the
swept
southward
like
a
living
thing
her
oars
pulled
now
by
free
and
willing
hands
she
had
been
transformed
from
a
peaceful
trader
into
a
insofar
as
the
transformation
was
possible
men
sat
at
the
benches
now
with
swords
at
their
sides
and
gilded
helmets
on
their
kinky
heads
shields
were
hung
along
the
rails
and
sheafs
of
spears
bows
and
arrows
adorned
the
mast
even
the
elements
seemed
to
work
for
conan
now
the
broad
purple
sail
bellied
to
a
stiff
breeze
that
held
day
by
day
needing
little
aid
from
the
oars
but
though
conan
kept
a
man
on
the
masthead
day
and
night
they
did
not
sight
a
long
low
black
galley
fleeing
southward
ahead
of
them
day
by
day
the
blue
waters
rolled
empty
to
their
view
broken
only
by
which
fled
like
frightened
birds
before
them
at
sight
of
the
shields
hung
along
the
rail
the
season
for
trading
was
practically
over
for
the
year
and
they
sighted
no
other
ships
when
the
lookout
did
sight
a
sail
it
was
to
the
north
not
the
south
far
on
the
skyline
behind
them
appeared
a
with
full
spread
of
purple
sail
the
blacks
urged
conan
to
turn
and
plunder
it
but
he
shook
his
head
somewhere
south
of
him
a
slim
black
galley
was
racing
toward
the
ports
of
stygia
that
night
before
darkness
shut
down
the
lookout
last
glimpse
showed
him
the
on
the
horizon
and
at
dawn
it
was
still
hanging
on
their
tail
afar
off
tiny
in
the
distance
conan
wondered
if
it
was
following
him
though
he
could
think
of
no
logical
reason
for
such
a
supposition
but
he
paid
little
heed
each
day
that
carried
him
farther
southward
filled
him
with
fiercer
impatience
doubts
never
assailed
him
as
he
believed
in
the
rise
and
set
of
the
sun
he
believed
that
a
priest
of
set
had
stolen
the
heart
of
ahriman
and
where
would
a
priest
of
set
carry
it
but
to
stygia
the
blacks
sensed
his
eagerness
and
toiled
as
they
had
never
toiled
under
the
lash
though
ignorant
of
his
goal
they
anticipated
a
red
career
of
pillage
and
plunder
and
were
content
the
men
of
the
southern
isles
knew
no
other
trade
and
the
kushites
of
the
crew
joined
in
the
prospect
of
looting
their
own
people
with
the
callousness
of
their
race
meant
little
a
victorious
chieftain
and
personal
gain
everything
soon
the
character
of
the
coastline
changed
no
longer
they
sailed
past
steep
cliffs
with
blue
hills
marching
behind
them
now
the
shore
was
the
edge
of
broad
meadowlands
which
barely
rose
above
the
water
edge
and
swept
away
and
away
into
the
hazy
distance
here
were
few
harbors
and
fewer
ports
but
the
green
plain
was
dotted
with
the
cities
of
the
shemites
green
sea
lapping
the
rim
of
the
green
plains
and
the
ziggurats
of
the
cities
gleaming
whitely
in
the
sun
some
small
in
the
distance
through
the
moved
the
herds
of
cattle
and
squat
broad
riders
with
cylindrical
helmets
and
curled
beards
with
bows
in
their
hands
this
was
the
shore
of
the
lands
of
shem
where
there
was
no
law
save
as
each
could
enforce
its
own
far
to
the
eastward
conan
knew
the
meadowlands
gave
way
to
desert
where
there
were
no
cities
and
the
nomadic
tribes
roamed
unhindered
still
as
they
plied
southward
past
the
changeless
panorama
of
meadowland
at
last
the
scenery
again
began
to
alter
clumps
of
tamarind
appeared
the
palm
groves
grew
denser
the
shoreline
became
more
broken
a
marching
rampart
of
green
fronds
and
trees
and
behind
them
rose
bare
sandy
hills
streams
poured
into
the
sea
and
along
their
moist
banks
vegetation
grew
thick
and
of
vast
variety
so
at
last
they
passed
the
mouth
of
a
broad
river
that
mingled
its
flow
with
the
ocean
and
saw
the
great
black
walls
and
towers
of
khemi
rise
against
the
southern
horizon
the
river
was
the
styx
the
real
border
of
stygia
khemi
was
greatest
port
and
at
that
time
her
most
important
city
the
king
dwelt
at
more
ancient
luxur
but
in
khemi
reigned
the
priestcraft
though
men
said
the
center
of
their
dark
religion
lay
far
inland
in
a
mysterious
deserted
city
near
the
bank
of
the
styx
this
river
springing
from
some
nameless
source
far
in
the
unknown
lands
south
of
stygia
ran
northward
for
a
thousand
miles
before
it
turned
and
flowed
westward
for
some
hundreds
of
miles
to
empty
at
last
into
the
ocean
the
showing
no
lights
stole
past
the
port
in
the
night
and
before
dawn
discovered
her
anchored
in
a
small
bay
a
few
miles
south
of
the
city
it
was
surrounded
by
marsh
a
green
tangle
of
mangroves
palms
and
lianas
swarming
with
crocodiles
and
serpents
discovery
was
extremely
unlikely
conan
knew
the
place
of
old
he
had
hidden
there
before
in
his
corsair
days
as
they
slid
silently
past
the
city
whose
great
black
bastions
rose
on
the
jutting
prongs
of
land
which
locked
the
harbor
torches
gleamed
and
smoldered
luridly
and
to
their
ears
came
the
low
thunder
of
drums
the
port
was
not
crowded
with
ships
as
were
the
harbors
of
argos
the
stygians
did
not
base
their
glory
and
power
upon
ships
and
fleets
and
indeed
they
had
but
not
in
proportion
to
their
inland
strength
many
of
their
craft
plied
up
and
down
the
great
river
rather
than
along
the
the
stygians
were
an
ancient
race
a
dark
inscrutable
people
powerful
and
merciless
long
ago
their
rule
had
stretched
far
north
of
the
styx
beyond
the
meadowlands
of
shem
and
into
the
fertile
uplands
now
inhabited
by
the
peoples
of
koth
and
ophir
and
argos
their
borders
had
marched
with
those
of
ancient
acheron
but
acheron
had
fallen
and
the
barbaric
ancestors
of
the
hyborians
had
swept
southward
in
wolfskins
and
horned
helmets
driving
the
ancient
rulers
of
the
land
before
them
the
stygians
had
not
forgotten
all
day
the
lay
at
anchor
in
the
tiny
bay
walled
in
with
green
branches
and
tangled
vines
through
which
flitted
birds
and
among
which
glided
silent
reptiles
toward
sundown
a
small
boat
crept
out
and
down
along
the
shore
seeking
and
finding
that
which
conan
desired
a
stygian
fisherman
in
his
shallow
boat
they
brought
him
to
the
deck
of
the
a
tall
dark
rangily
built
man
ashy
with
fear
of
his
captors
who
were
ogres
of
that
coast
he
was
naked
except
for
his
silken
breeks
for
like
the
hyrkanians
even
the
commoners
and
slaves
of
stygia
wore
silk
and
in
his
boat
was
a
wide
mantle
such
as
these
fishermen
flung
about
their
shoulders
against
the
chill
of
the
night
he
fell
to
his
knees
before
conan
expecting
torture
and
death
on
your
legs
man
and
quit
trembling
said
the
cimmerian
impatiently
who
found
it
difficult
to
understand
abject
terror
wo
be
harmed
tell
me
but
this
has
a
galley
a
black
returning
from
argos
put
into
khemi
within
the
last
few
days
my
lord
answered
the
fisherman
yesterday
at
dawn
the
priest
thutothmes
returned
from
a
voyage
far
to
the
north
men
say
he
has
been
to
messantia
did
he
bring
from
messantia
my
lord
i
know
not
did
he
go
to
messantia
demanded
conan
my
lord
i
am
but
a
common
man
who
am
i
to
know
the
minds
of
the
priests
of
set
i
can
only
speak
what
i
have
seen
and
what
i
have
heard
men
whisper
along
the
wharves
men
say
that
news
of
great
import
came
southward
though
of
what
none
knows
and
it
is
well
known
that
the
lord
thutothmes
put
off
in
his
black
galley
in
great
haste
now
he
is
returned
but
what
he
did
in
argos
or
what
cargo
he
brought
back
none
knows
not
even
the
seamen
who
manned
his
galley
men
say
that
he
has
opposed
who
is
the
master
of
all
priests
of
set
and
dwells
in
luxur
and
that
thutothmes
seeks
hidden
power
to
overthrow
the
great
one
but
who
am
i
to
say
when
priests
war
with
one
another
a
common
man
can
but
lie
on
his
belly
and
hope
neither
treads
upon
him
conan
snarled
in
nervous
exasperation
at
this
servile
philosophy
and
turned
to
his
men
going
alone
into
khemi
to
find
this
thief
thutothmes
keep
this
man
prisoner
but
see
that
you
do
him
no
hurt
crom
devils
stop
your
yowling
do
you
think
we
can
sail
into
the
harbor
and
take
the
city
by
storm
i
must
go
alone
silencing
the
clamor
of
protests
he
doffed
his
own
garments
and
donned
the
prisoner
silk
breeches
and
sandals
and
the
band
from
the
hair
but
scorned
the
short
fisherman
knife
the
common
men
of
stygia
were
not
allowed
to
wear
swords
and
the
mantle
was
not
voluminous
enough
to
hide
the
cimmerian
long
blade
but
conan
buckled
to
his
hip
a
ghanata
knife
a
weapon
borne
by
the
fierce
desert
men
who
dwelt
to
the
south
of
the
stygians
a
broad
heavy
slightly
curved
blade
of
fine
steel
edged
like
a
razor
and
long
enough
to
dismember
a
man
then
leaving
the
stygian
guarded
by
the
corsairs
conan
climbed
into
the
fisher
boat
for
me
until
dawn
he
said
i
have
come
then
i
never
come
so
hasten
southward
to
your
own
homes
as
he
clambered
over
the
rail
they
set
up
a
doleful
wail
at
his
going
until
he
thrust
his
head
back
into
sight
to
curse
them
into
silence
then
dropping
into
the
boat
he
grasped
the
oars
and
sent
the
tiny
craft
shooting
over
the
waves
more
swiftly
than
its
owner
had
ever
propelled
it
has
slain
the
sacred
son
of
set
the
harbor
of
khemi
lay
between
two
great
jutting
points
of
land
that
ran
into
the
ocean
he
rounded
the
southern
point
where
the
great
black
castles
rose
like
a
hill
and
entered
the
harbor
just
at
dusk
when
there
was
still
enough
light
for
the
watchers
to
recognize
the
fisherman
boat
and
mantle
but
not
enough
to
permit
recognition
of
betraying
details
unchallenged
he
threaded
his
way
among
the
great
black
war
galleys
lying
silent
and
unlighted
at
anchor
and
drew
up
to
a
flight
of
wide
stone
steps
which
mounted
up
from
the
water
edge
there
he
made
his
boat
fast
to
an
iron
ring
set
in
the
stone
as
numerous
similar
craft
were
tied
there
was
nothing
strange
in
a
fisherman
leaving
his
boat
there
none
but
a
fisherman
could
find
a
use
for
such
a
craft
and
they
did
not
steal
from
one
another
no
one
cast
him
more
than
a
casual
glance
as
he
mounted
the
long
steps
unobtrusively
avoiding
the
torches
that
flared
at
intervals
above
the
lapping
black
water
he
seemed
but
an
ordinary
fisherman
returning
after
a
fruitless
day
along
the
coast
if
one
had
observed
him
closely
it
might
have
seemed
that
his
step
was
somewhat
too
springy
and
sure
his
carriage
somewhat
too
erect
and
confident
for
a
lowly
fisherman
but
he
passed
quickly
keeping
in
the
shadows
and
the
commoners
of
stygia
were
no
more
given
to
analysis
than
were
the
commoners
of
the
less
exotic
races
in
build
he
was
not
unlike
the
warrior
casts
of
the
stygians
who
were
a
tall
muscular
race
bronzed
by
the
sun
he
was
nearly
as
dark
as
many
of
them
his
black
hair
and
confined
by
a
copper
band
increased
the
resemblance
the
characteristics
which
set
him
apart
from
them
were
the
subtle
difference
in
his
walk
and
his
alien
features
and
blue
eyes
but
the
mantle
was
a
good
disguise
and
he
kept
as
much
in
the
shadows
as
possible
turning
away
his
head
when
a
native
passed
him
too
closely
but
it
was
a
desperate
game
and
he
knew
he
could
not
long
keep
up
the
deception
khemi
was
not
like
the
of
the
hyborians
where
types
of
every
race
swarmed
the
only
aliens
here
were
negro
and
shemite
slaves
and
he
resembled
neither
even
as
much
as
he
resembled
the
stygians
themselves
strangers
were
not
welcome
in
the
cities
of
stygia
tolerated
only
when
they
came
as
ambassadors
or
licensed
traders
but
even
then
the
latter
were
not
allowed
ashore
after
dark
and
now
there
were
no
hyborian
ships
in
the
harbor
at
all
a
strange
restlessness
ran
through
the
city
a
stirring
of
ancient
ambitions
a
whispering
none
could
define
except
those
who
whispered
this
conan
felt
rather
than
knew
his
whetted
primitive
instincts
sensing
unrest
about
him
if
he
were
discovered
his
fate
would
be
ghastly
they
would
slay
him
merely
for
being
a
stranger
if
he
were
recognized
as
amra
the
corsair
chief
who
had
swept
their
coasts
with
steel
and
flame
an
involuntary
shudder
twitched
conan
broad
shoulders
human
foes
he
did
not
fear
nor
any
death
by
steel
or
fire
but
this
was
a
black
land
of
sorcery
and
nameless
horror
set
the
old
serpent
men
said
banished
long
ago
from
the
hyborian
races
yet
lurked
in
the
shadows
of
the
cryptic
temples
and
awful
and
mysterious
were
the
deeds
done
in
the
nighted
shrines
he
had
drawn
away
from
the
waterfront
streets
with
their
broad
steps
leading
down
to
the
water
and
was
entering
the
long
shadowy
streets
of
the
main
part
of
the
city
there
was
no
such
scene
as
was
offered
by
any
hyborian
city
no
blaze
of
lamps
and
cressets
with
people
laughing
and
strolling
along
the
pavements
and
shops
and
stalls
wide
open
and
displaying
their
wares
here
the
stalls
were
closed
at
dusk
the
only
lights
along
the
streets
were
torches
flaring
smokily
at
wide
intervals
people
walking
the
streets
were
comparatively
few
they
went
hurriedly
and
unspeaking
and
their
numbers
decreased
with
the
lateness
of
the
hour
conan
found
the
scene
gloomy
and
unreal
the
silence
of
the
people
their
furtive
haste
the
great
black
stone
walls
that
rose
on
each
side
of
the
streets
there
was
a
grim
massiveness
about
stygian
architecture
that
was
overpowering
and
oppressive
few
lights
showed
anywhere
except
in
the
upper
parts
of
the
buildings
conan
knew
that
most
of
the
people
lay
on
the
flat
roofs
among
the
palms
of
artificial
gardens
under
the
stars
there
was
a
murmur
of
weird
music
from
somewhere
occasionally
a
bronze
chariot
rumbled
along
the
flags
and
there
was
a
brief
glimpse
of
a
tall
noble
with
a
silk
cloak
wrapped
about
him
and
a
gold
band
with
a
rearing
emblem
confining
his
black
mane
of
the
ebon
naked
charioteer
bracing
his
knotty
legs
against
the
straining
of
the
fierce
stygian
horses
but
the
people
who
yet
traversed
the
streets
on
foot
were
commoners
slaves
tradesmen
harlots
toilers
and
they
became
fewer
as
he
progressed
he
was
making
toward
the
temple
of
set
where
he
knew
he
would
be
likely
to
find
the
priest
he
sought
he
believed
he
would
know
thutothmes
if
he
saw
him
though
his
one
glance
had
been
in
the
of
the
messantian
alley
that
the
man
he
had
seen
there
had
been
the
priest
he
was
certain
only
occultists
high
in
the
mazes
of
the
hideous
black
ring
possessed
the
power
of
the
black
hand
that
dealt
death
by
its
touch
and
only
such
a
man
would
dare
defy
whom
the
western
world
knew
only
as
a
figure
of
terror
and
myth
the
street
broadened
and
conan
was
aware
that
he
was
getting
into
the
part
of
the
city
dedicated
to
the
temples
the
great
structures
reared
their
black
bulks
against
the
dim
stars
grim
indescribably
menacing
in
the
flare
of
the
few
torches
and
suddenly
he
heard
a
low
scream
from
a
woman
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
somewhat
ahead
of
him
a
naked
courtesan
wearing
the
tall
plumed
of
her
class
she
was
shrinking
back
against
the
wall
staring
across
at
something
he
could
not
yet
see
at
her
cry
the
few
people
on
the
street
halted
suddenly
as
if
frozen
at
the
same
instant
conan
was
aware
of
a
sinister
slithering
ahead
of
him
then
about
the
dark
corner
of
the
building
he
was
approaching
poked
a
hideous
head
and
after
it
flowed
coil
after
coil
of
rippling
darkly
glistening
trunk
the
cimmerian
recoiled
remembering
tales
he
had
heard
serpents
were
sacred
to
set
god
of
stygia
who
men
said
was
himself
a
serpent
monsters
such
as
this
were
kept
in
the
temples
of
set
and
when
they
hungered
were
allowed
to
crawl
forth
into
the
streets
to
take
what
prey
they
wished
their
ghastly
feasts
were
considered
a
sacrifice
to
the
scaly
god
the
stygians
within
conan
sight
fell
to
their
knees
men
and
women
and
passively
awaited
their
fate
one
the
great
serpent
would
select
would
lap
in
scaly
coils
crush
to
a
red
pulp
and
swallow
as
a
swallows
a
mouse
the
others
would
live
that
was
the
will
of
the
gods
but
it
was
not
conan
will
the
python
glided
toward
him
its
attention
probably
attracted
by
the
fact
that
he
was
the
only
human
in
sight
still
standing
erect
gripping
his
great
knife
under
his
mantle
conan
hoped
the
slimy
brute
would
pass
him
by
but
it
halted
before
him
and
reared
up
horrifically
in
the
flickering
torchlight
its
forked
tongue
flickering
in
and
out
its
cold
eyes
glittering
with
the
ancient
cruelty
of
the
its
neck
arched
but
before
it
could
dart
conan
whipped
his
knife
from
under
his
mantle
and
struck
like
a
flicker
of
lightning
the
broad
blade
split
that
head
and
sheared
deep
into
the
thick
neck
conan
wrenched
his
knife
free
and
sprang
clear
as
the
great
body
knotted
and
looped
and
whipped
terrifically
in
its
death
throes
in
the
moment
that
he
stood
staring
in
morbid
fascination
the
only
sound
was
the
thud
and
swish
of
the
snake
tail
against
the
stones
then
from
the
shocked
votaries
burst
a
terrible
cry
he
has
slain
the
sacred
son
of
set
slay
him
slay
slay
stones
whizzed
about
him
and
the
crazed
stygians
rushed
at
him
shrieking
hysterically
while
from
all
sides
others
emerged
from
their
houses
and
took
up
the
cry
with
a
curse
conan
wheeled
and
darted
into
the
black
mouth
of
an
alley
he
heard
the
patter
of
bare
feet
on
the
flags
behind
him
as
he
ran
more
by
feel
than
by
sight
and
the
walls
resounded
to
the
vengeful
yells
of
the
pursuers
then
his
left
hand
found
a
break
in
the
wall
and
he
turned
sharply
into
another
narrower
alley
on
both
sides
rose
sheer
black
stone
walls
high
above
him
he
could
see
a
thin
line
of
stars
these
giant
walls
he
knew
were
the
walls
of
temples
he
heard
behind
him
the
pack
sweep
past
the
dark
mouth
in
full
cry
their
shouts
grew
distant
faded
away
they
had
missed
the
smaller
alley
and
run
straight
on
in
the
blackness
he
too
kept
straight
ahead
though
the
thought
of
encountering
another
of
in
the
darkness
brought
a
shudder
from
him
then
somewhere
ahead
of
him
he
caught
a
moving
glow
like
that
of
a
crawling
he
halted
flattened
himself
against
the
wall
and
gripped
his
knife
he
knew
what
it
was
a
man
approaching
with
a
torch
now
it
was
so
close
he
could
make
out
the
dark
hand
that
gripped
it
and
the
dim
oval
of
a
dark
face
a
few
more
steps
and
the
man
would
certainly
see
him
he
sank
into
a
tigerish
crouch
the
torch
halted
a
door
was
briefly
etched
in
the
glow
while
the
fumbled
with
it
then
it
opened
the
tall
figure
vanished
through
it
and
darkness
closed
again
on
the
alley
there
was
a
sinister
suggestion
of
furtiveness
about
that
slinking
figure
entering
the
in
darkness
a
priest
perhaps
returning
from
some
dark
errand
but
conan
groped
toward
the
door
if
one
man
came
up
that
alley
with
a
torch
others
might
come
at
any
time
to
retreat
the
way
he
had
come
might
mean
to
run
full
into
the
mob
from
which
he
was
fleeing
at
any
moment
they
might
return
find
the
narrower
alley
and
come
howling
down
it
he
felt
hemmed
in
by
those
sheer
unscalable
walls
desirous
of
escape
even
if
escape
meant
invading
some
unknown
building
the
heavy
bronze
door
was
not
locked
it
opened
under
his
fingers
and
he
peered
through
the
crack
he
was
looking
into
a
great
square
chamber
of
massive
black
stone
a
torch
smoldered
in
a
niche
in
the
wall
the
chamber
was
empty
he
glided
through
the
lacquered
door
and
closed
it
behind
him
his
sandaled
feet
made
no
sound
as
he
crossed
the
black
marble
floor
a
teak
door
stood
partly
open
and
gliding
through
this
knife
in
hand
he
came
out
into
a
great
dim
shadowy
place
whose
lofty
ceiling
was
only
a
hint
of
darkness
high
above
him
toward
which
the
black
walls
swept
upward
on
all
sides
doorways
opened
into
the
great
still
hall
it
was
lit
by
curious
bronze
lamps
that
gave
a
dim
weird
light
on
the
other
side
of
the
great
hall
a
broad
black
marble
stairway
without
a
railing
marched
upward
to
lose
itself
in
gloom
and
above
him
on
all
sides
dim
galleries
hung
like
black
stone
ledges
conan
shivered
he
was
in
a
temple
of
some
stygian
god
if
not
set
himself
then
someone
barely
less
grim
and
the
shrine
did
not
lack
an
occupant
in
the
midst
of
the
great
hall
stood
a
black
stone
altar
massive
somber
without
carvings
or
ornament
and
upon
it
coiled
one
of
the
great
sacred
serpents
its
iridescent
scales
shimmering
in
the
lamplight
it
did
not
move
and
conan
remembered
stories
that
the
priests
kept
these
creatures
drugged
part
of
the
time
the
cimmerian
took
an
uncertain
step
out
from
the
door
then
shrank
back
suddenly
not
into
the
room
he
had
just
quitted
but
into
a
recess
he
had
heard
a
soft
step
somewhere
near
by
from
one
of
the
black
arches
emerged
a
tall
powerful
figure
in
sandals
and
silken
with
a
wide
mantle
trailing
from
his
shoulders
but
face
and
head
were
hidden
by
a
monstrous
mask
a
countenance
from
the
crest
of
which
floated
a
mass
of
ostrich
plumes
in
certain
ceremonies
the
stygian
priests
went
masked
conan
hoped
the
man
would
not
discover
him
but
some
instinct
warned
the
stygian
he
turned
abruptly
from
his
destination
which
apparently
was
the
stair
and
stepped
straight
to
the
recess
as
he
jerked
aside
the
velvet
hanging
a
hand
darted
from
the
shadows
crushed
the
cry
in
his
throat
and
jerked
him
headlong
into
the
alcove
and
the
knife
impaled
him
conan
next
move
was
the
obvious
one
suggested
by
logic
he
lifted
off
the
grinning
mask
and
drew
it
over
his
own
head
the
fisherman
mantle
he
flung
over
the
body
of
the
priest
which
he
concealed
behind
the
hangings
and
drew
the
priestly
mantle
about
his
own
brawny
shoulders
fate
had
given
him
a
disguise
all
khemi
might
well
be
searching
now
for
the
blasphemer
who
dared
defend
himself
against
a
sacred
snake
but
who
would
dream
of
looking
for
him
under
the
mask
of
a
priest
he
strode
boldly
from
the
alcove
and
headed
for
one
of
the
arched
doorways
at
random
but
he
had
not
taken
a
dozen
strides
when
he
wheeled
again
all
his
senses
edged
for
peril
a
band
of
masked
figures
filed
down
the
stair
appareled
exactly
as
he
was
he
hesitated
caught
in
the
open
and
stood
still
trusting
to
his
disguise
though
cold
sweat
gathered
on
his
forehead
and
the
backs
of
his
hands
no
word
was
spoken
like
phantoms
they
descended
into
the
great
hall
and
moved
past
him
toward
a
black
arch
the
leader
carried
an
ebon
staff
which
supported
a
grinning
white
skull
and
conan
knew
it
was
one
of
the
ritualistic
processions
so
inexplicable
to
a
foreigner
but
which
played
a
strong
and
often
sinister
part
in
the
stygian
religion
the
last
figure
turned
his
head
slightly
toward
the
motionless
cimmerian
as
if
expecting
him
to
follow
not
to
do
what
was
obviously
expected
of
him
would
rouse
instant
suspicion
conan
fell
in
behind
the
last
man
and
suited
his
gait
to
their
measured
pace
they
traversed
a
long
dark
vaulted
corridor
in
which
conan
noticed
uneasily
the
skull
on
the
staff
glowed
phosphorescently
he
felt
a
surge
of
unreasoning
wild
animal
panic
that
urged
him
to
rip
out
his
knife
and
slash
right
and
left
at
these
uncanny
figures
to
flee
madly
from
the
grim
dark
temple
but
he
held
himself
in
check
fighting
down
the
dim
monstrous
intuitions
that
rose
in
the
back
of
his
mind
and
peopled
the
gloom
with
shadowy
shapes
of
horror
and
presently
he
barely
stifled
a
sigh
of
relief
as
they
filed
through
a
great
door
which
was
three
times
higher
than
a
man
and
emerged
into
the
starlight
conan
wondered
if
he
dared
fade
into
some
dark
alley
but
hesitated
uncertain
and
down
the
long
dark
street
they
padded
silently
while
such
folk
as
they
met
turned
their
heads
away
and
fled
from
them
the
procession
kept
far
out
from
the
walls
to
turn
and
bolt
into
any
of
the
alleys
they
passed
would
be
too
conspicuous
while
he
mentally
fumed
and
cursed
they
came
to
a
gateway
in
the
southern
wall
and
through
this
they
filed
ahead
of
them
and
about
them
lay
clusters
of
low
mud
houses
and
shadowy
in
the
starlight
now
if
ever
thought
conan
was
his
time
to
escape
his
silent
companions
but
the
moment
the
gate
was
left
behind
them
those
companions
were
no
longer
silent
they
began
to
mutter
excitedly
among
themselves
the
measured
ritualistic
gait
was
abandoned
the
staff
with
its
skull
was
tucked
unceremoniously
under
the
leader
arm
and
the
whole
group
broke
ranks
and
hurried
onward
and
conan
hurried
with
them
for
in
the
low
murmur
of
speech
he
had
caught
a
word
that
galvanized
him
the
word
was
am
the
woman
who
never
conan
stared
with
burning
interest
at
his
masked
companions
one
of
them
was
thutothmes
or
else
the
destination
of
the
band
was
a
rendezvous
with
the
man
he
sought
and
he
knew
what
that
destination
was
when
beyond
the
palms
he
glimpsed
a
black
triangular
bulk
looming
against
the
shadowy
sky
they
passed
through
the
belt
of
huts
and
groves
and
if
any
man
saw
them
he
was
careful
not
to
show
himself
the
huts
were
dark
behind
them
the
black
towers
of
khemi
rose
gloomily
against
the
stars
that
were
mirrored
in
the
waters
of
the
harbor
ahead
of
them
the
desert
stretched
away
in
dim
darkness
somewhere
a
jackal
yapped
the
sandals
of
the
silent
neophytes
made
no
noise
in
the
sand
they
might
have
been
ghosts
moving
toward
that
colossal
pyramid
that
rose
out
of
the
murk
of
the
desert
there
was
no
sound
over
all
the
sleeping
land
conan
heart
beat
quicker
as
he
gazed
at
the
grim
black
wedge
that
stood
etched
against
the
stars
and
his
impatience
to
close
with
thutothmes
in
whatever
conflict
the
meeting
might
mean
was
not
unmixed
with
a
fear
of
the
unknown
no
man
could
approach
one
of
those
somber
piles
of
black
stone
without
apprehension
the
very
name
was
a
symbol
of
repellent
horror
among
the
northern
nations
and
legends
hinted
that
the
stygians
did
not
build
them
that
they
were
in
the
land
at
whatever
immeasurably
ancient
date
the
people
came
into
the
land
of
the
great
river
as
they
approached
the
pyramid
he
glimpsed
a
dim
glow
near
the
base
which
presently
resolved
itself
into
a
doorway
on
either
side
of
which
brooded
stone
lions
with
the
heads
of
women
cryptic
inscrutable
nightmares
crystalized
in
stone
the
leader
of
the
band
made
straight
for
the
doorway
in
the
deep
well
of
which
conan
saw
a
shadowy
figure
the
leader
paused
an
instant
beside
this
dim
figure
and
then
vanished
into
the
dark
interior
and
one
by
one
the
others
followed
as
each
masked
priest
passed
through
the
gloomy
portal
he
was
halted
briefly
by
the
mysterious
guardian
and
something
passed
between
them
some
word
or
gesture
conan
could
not
make
out
seeing
this
the
cimmerian
purposely
lagged
behind
and
stooping
pretended
to
be
fumbling
with
the
fastening
of
his
sandal
not
until
the
last
of
the
masked
figures
had
disappeared
did
he
straighten
and
approach
the
portal
he
was
uneasily
wondering
if
the
guardian
of
the
temple
were
human
remembering
some
tales
he
had
heard
but
his
doubts
were
set
at
rest
a
dim
bronze
cresset
glowing
just
within
the
door
lighted
a
long
narrow
corridor
that
ran
away
into
blackness
and
a
man
standing
silent
in
the
mouth
of
it
wrapped
in
a
wide
black
cloak
no
one
else
was
in
sight
obviously
the
masked
priests
had
disappeared
down
the
corridor
over
the
cloak
that
was
drawn
about
his
lower
features
the
piercing
eyes
regarded
conan
sharply
with
his
left
hand
he
made
a
curious
gesture
on
a
venture
conan
imitated
it
but
evidently
another
gesture
was
expected
the
stygian
right
hand
came
from
under
his
cloak
with
a
gleam
of
steel
and
his
murderous
stab
would
have
pierced
the
heart
of
an
ordinary
man
but
he
was
dealing
with
one
whose
thews
were
nerved
to
the
quickness
of
a
jungle
cat
even
as
the
dagger
flashed
in
the
dim
light
conan
caught
the
dusky
wrist
and
smashed
his
clenched
right
fist
against
the
stygian
jaw
the
man
head
went
back
against
the
stone
wall
with
a
dull
crunch
that
told
of
a
fractured
skull
standing
for
an
instant
above
him
conan
listened
intently
the
cresset
burned
low
casting
vague
shadows
about
the
door
nothing
stirred
in
the
blackness
beyond
though
far
away
and
below
him
as
it
seemed
he
caught
the
faint
muffled
note
of
a
gong
he
stooped
and
dragged
the
body
behind
the
great
bronze
door
which
stood
wide
opened
inward
and
then
the
cimmerian
went
warily
but
swiftly
down
the
corridor
toward
what
doom
he
did
not
even
try
to
guess
he
had
not
gone
far
when
he
halted
baffled
the
corridor
split
in
two
branches
and
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
which
the
masked
priests
had
taken
at
a
venture
he
chose
the
left
the
floor
slanted
slightly
downward
and
was
worn
smooth
as
by
many
feet
here
and
there
a
dim
cresset
cast
a
faint
nightmarish
twilight
conan
wondered
uneasily
for
what
purpose
these
colossal
piles
had
been
reared
in
what
forgotten
age
this
was
an
ancient
ancient
land
no
man
knew
how
many
ages
the
black
temples
of
stygia
had
looked
against
the
stars
narrow
black
arches
opened
occasionally
to
right
and
left
but
he
kept
to
the
main
corridor
although
a
conviction
that
he
had
taken
the
wrong
branch
was
growing
in
him
even
with
their
start
on
him
he
should
have
overtaken
the
priests
by
this
time
he
was
growing
nervous
the
silence
was
like
a
tangible
thing
and
yet
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
was
not
alone
more
than
once
passing
a
nighted
arch
he
seemed
to
feel
the
glare
of
unseen
eyes
fixed
upon
him
he
paused
half
minded
to
turn
back
to
where
the
corridor
had
first
branched
he
wheeled
abruptly
knife
lifted
every
nerve
tingling
a
girl
stood
at
the
mouth
of
a
smaller
tunnel
staring
fixedly
at
him
her
ivory
skin
showed
her
to
be
stygian
of
some
ancient
noble
family
and
like
all
such
women
she
was
tall
lithe
voluptuously
figured
her
hair
a
great
pile
of
black
foam
among
which
gleamed
a
sparkling
ruby
but
for
her
velvet
sandals
and
broad
girdle
about
her
supple
waist
she
was
quite
nude
do
you
here
she
demanded
to
answer
would
betray
his
alien
origin
he
remained
motionless
a
grim
somber
figure
in
the
hideous
mask
with
the
plumes
floating
over
him
his
alert
gaze
sought
the
shadows
behind
her
and
found
them
empty
but
there
might
be
hordes
of
within
her
call
she
advanced
toward
him
apparently
without
apprehension
though
with
suspicion
are
not
a
priest
she
said
are
a
even
with
that
mask
that
is
plain
there
is
as
much
difference
between
you
and
a
priest
as
there
is
between
a
man
and
a
woman
by
set
she
exclaimed
halting
suddenly
her
eyes
flaring
wide
do
not
believe
you
are
even
a
stygian
with
a
movement
too
quick
for
the
eye
to
follow
his
hand
closed
about
her
round
throat
lightly
as
a
caress
a
sound
out
of
you
he
muttered
her
smooth
ivory
flesh
was
cold
as
marble
yet
there
was
no
fear
in
the
wide
dark
marvelous
eyes
which
regarded
him
not
fear
she
answered
calmly
will
not
betray
you
but
are
you
mad
to
come
a
stranger
and
a
foreigner
to
the
forbidden
temple
of
set
looking
for
the
priest
thutothmes
he
answered
he
in
this
temple
do
you
seek
him
she
parried
has
something
of
mine
which
was
stolen
will
lead
you
to
him
she
volunteered
so
promptly
that
his
suspicions
were
instantly
roused
play
with
me
girl
he
growled
do
not
play
with
you
i
have
no
love
for
thutothmes
he
hesitated
then
made
up
his
mind
after
all
he
was
as
much
in
her
power
as
she
was
in
his
beside
me
he
commanded
shifting
his
grasp
from
her
throat
to
her
wrist
walk
with
care
if
you
make
a
suspicious
move
she
led
him
down
the
slanting
corridor
down
and
down
until
there
were
no
more
cressets
and
he
groped
his
way
in
darkness
aware
less
by
sight
than
by
feel
and
sense
of
the
woman
at
his
side
once
when
he
spoke
to
her
she
turned
her
head
toward
him
and
he
was
startled
to
see
her
eyes
glowing
like
golden
fire
in
the
dark
dim
doubts
and
vague
monstrous
suspicions
haunted
his
mind
but
he
followed
her
through
a
labyrinthine
maze
of
black
corridors
that
confused
even
his
primitive
sense
of
direction
he
mentally
cursed
himself
for
a
fool
allowing
himself
to
be
led
into
that
black
abode
of
mystery
but
it
was
too
late
to
turn
back
now
again
he
felt
life
and
movement
in
the
darkness
about
him
sensed
peril
and
hunger
burning
impatiently
in
the
blackness
unless
his
ears
deceived
him
he
caught
a
faint
sliding
noise
that
ceased
and
receded
at
a
muttered
command
from
the
girl
she
led
him
at
last
into
a
chamber
lighted
by
a
curious
candelabrum
in
which
black
candles
burned
weirdly
he
knew
they
were
far
below
the
earth
the
chamber
was
square
with
walls
and
ceiling
of
polished
black
marble
and
furnished
after
the
manner
of
the
ancient
stygians
there
was
a
couch
of
ebony
covered
with
black
velvet
and
on
a
black
stone
dais
lay
a
carven
conan
stood
waiting
expectantly
staring
at
the
various
black
arches
which
opened
into
the
chamber
but
the
girl
made
no
move
to
go
farther
stretching
herself
on
the
couch
with
feline
suppleness
she
intertwined
her
fingers
behind
her
sleek
head
and
regarded
him
from
under
long
drooping
lashes
he
demanded
impatiently
are
you
doing
thutothmes
is
no
haste
she
answered
lazily
is
an
hour
or
a
day
or
a
year
or
a
century
for
that
matter
take
off
your
mask
let
me
see
your
features
with
a
grunt
of
annoyance
conan
dragged
off
the
bulky
headpiece
and
the
girl
nodded
as
if
in
approval
as
she
scanned
his
dark
scarred
face
and
blazing
eyes
is
strength
in
you
great
strength
you
could
strangle
a
bullock
he
moved
restlessly
his
suspicion
growing
with
his
hand
on
his
hilt
he
peered
into
the
gloomy
arches
you
brought
me
into
a
trap
he
said
wo
live
to
enjoy
your
handiwork
are
you
going
to
get
off
that
couch
and
do
as
you
promised
or
do
i
have
to
his
voice
trailed
away
he
was
staring
at
the
on
which
the
countenance
of
the
occupant
was
carved
in
ivory
with
the
startling
vividness
of
a
forgotten
art
there
was
a
disquieting
familiarity
about
that
carven
mask
and
with
something
of
a
shock
he
realized
what
it
was
there
was
a
startling
resemblance
between
it
and
the
face
of
the
girl
lolling
on
the
ebon
couch
she
might
have
been
the
model
from
which
it
was
carved
but
he
knew
the
portrait
was
at
least
centuries
old
archaic
hieroglyphics
were
scrawled
across
the
lacquered
lid
and
seeking
back
into
his
mind
for
of
learning
picked
up
here
and
there
as
incidentals
of
an
adventurous
life
he
spelled
them
out
and
said
aloud
have
heard
of
princess
akivasha
inquired
the
girl
on
the
couch
has
he
grunted
the
name
of
that
ancient
evil
beautiful
princess
still
lived
the
world
over
in
song
and
legend
though
ten
thousand
years
had
rolled
their
cycles
since
the
daughter
of
tuthamon
had
reveled
in
purple
feasts
amid
the
black
halls
of
ancient
luxur
only
sin
was
that
she
loved
life
and
all
the
meanings
of
life
said
the
stygian
girl
win
life
she
courted
death
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
growing
old
and
shriveled
and
worn
and
dying
at
last
as
hags
die
she
wooed
darkness
like
a
lover
and
his
gift
was
life
life
that
not
being
life
as
mortals
know
it
can
never
grow
old
and
fade
she
went
into
the
shadows
to
cheat
age
and
death
conan
glared
at
her
with
eyes
that
were
suddenly
burning
slits
and
he
wheeled
and
tore
the
lid
from
the
sarcophagus
it
was
empty
behind
him
the
girl
was
laughing
and
the
sound
froze
the
blood
in
his
veins
he
whirled
back
to
her
the
short
hairs
on
his
neck
bristling
are
akivasha
he
grated
she
laughed
and
shook
back
her
burnished
locks
spread
her
arms
sensuously
am
akivasha
i
am
the
woman
who
never
died
who
never
grew
old
who
fools
say
was
lifted
from
the
earth
by
the
gods
in
the
full
bloom
of
her
youth
and
beauty
to
queen
it
for
ever
in
some
celestial
clime
nay
it
is
in
the
shadows
that
mortals
find
immortality
ten
thousand
years
ago
i
died
to
live
for
ever
give
me
your
lips
strong
man
rising
lithely
she
came
to
him
rose
on
tiptoe
and
flung
her
arms
about
his
massive
neck
scowling
down
into
her
upturned
beautiful
countenance
he
was
aware
of
a
fearful
fascination
and
an
icy
fear
me
she
whispered
her
head
thrown
back
eyes
closed
and
lips
parted
me
of
your
blood
to
renew
my
youth
and
perpetuate
my
everlasting
life
i
will
make
you
too
immortal
i
will
teach
you
the
wisdom
of
all
the
ages
all
the
secrets
that
have
lasted
out
the
eons
in
the
blackness
beneath
these
dark
temples
i
will
make
you
king
of
that
shadowy
horde
which
revels
among
the
tombs
of
the
ancients
when
night
veils
the
desert
and
bats
flit
across
the
moon
i
am
weary
of
priests
and
magicians
and
captive
girls
dragged
screaming
through
the
portals
of
death
i
desire
a
man
love
me
barbarian
she
pressed
her
dark
head
down
against
his
mighty
breast
and
he
felt
a
sharp
pang
at
the
base
of
his
throat
with
a
curse
he
tore
her
away
and
flung
her
sprawling
across
the
couch
vampire
blood
was
trickling
from
a
tiny
wound
in
his
throat
she
reared
up
on
the
couch
like
a
serpent
poised
to
strike
all
the
golden
fires
of
hell
blazing
in
her
wide
eyes
her
lips
drew
back
revealing
white
pointed
teeth
she
shrieked
you
think
to
escape
me
you
will
live
and
die
in
darkness
i
have
brought
you
far
below
the
temple
you
can
never
find
your
way
out
alone
you
can
never
cut
your
way
through
those
which
guard
the
tunnels
but
for
my
protection
the
sons
of
set
would
long
ago
have
taken
you
into
their
bellies
fool
i
shall
yet
drink
your
blood
away
from
me
or
i
slash
you
asunder
he
grunted
his
flesh
crawling
with
revulsion
may
be
immortal
but
steel
will
dismember
you
as
he
backed
toward
the
arch
through
which
he
had
entered
the
light
went
out
suddenly
all
the
candles
were
extinguished
at
once
though
he
did
not
know
how
for
akivasha
had
not
touched
them
but
the
laugh
rose
mockingly
behind
him
as
the
viols
of
hell
and
he
sweated
as
he
groped
in
the
darkness
for
the
arch
in
a
his
fingers
encountered
an
opening
and
he
plunged
through
it
whether
it
was
the
arch
through
which
he
had
entered
he
did
not
know
nor
did
he
very
much
care
his
one
thought
was
to
get
out
of
the
haunted
chamber
which
had
housed
that
beautiful
hideous
undead
fiend
for
so
many
centuries
his
wanderings
through
those
black
winding
tunnels
were
a
sweating
nightmare
behind
him
and
about
him
he
heard
faint
slitherings
and
glidings
and
once
the
echo
of
that
sweet
hellish
laughter
he
had
heard
in
the
chamber
of
akivasha
he
slashed
ferociously
at
sounds
and
movements
he
heard
or
imagined
he
heard
in
the
darkness
near
him
and
once
his
sword
cut
through
some
yielding
tenuous
substance
that
might
have
been
cobwebs
he
had
a
desperate
feeling
that
he
was
being
played
with
lured
deeper
and
deeper
into
ultimate
night
before
being
set
upon
by
demoniac
talon
and
fang
and
through
his
fear
ran
the
sickening
revulsion
of
his
discovery
the
legend
of
akivasha
was
so
old
and
among
the
evil
tales
told
of
her
ran
a
thread
of
beauty
and
idealism
of
everlasting
youth
to
so
many
dreamers
and
poets
and
lovers
she
was
not
alone
the
evil
princess
of
stygian
legend
but
the
symbol
of
eternal
youth
and
beauty
shining
for
ever
in
some
far
realm
of
the
gods
and
this
was
the
hideous
reality
this
foul
perversion
was
the
truth
of
that
everlasting
life
through
his
physical
revulsion
ran
the
sense
of
a
shattered
dream
of
man
idolatry
its
glittering
gold
proved
slime
and
cosmic
filth
a
wave
of
futility
swept
over
him
a
dim
fear
of
the
falseness
of
all
men
dreams
and
idolatries
and
now
he
knew
that
his
ears
were
not
playing
him
tricks
he
was
being
followed
and
his
pursuers
were
closing
in
on
him
in
the
darkness
sounded
shufflings
and
slidings
that
were
never
made
by
human
feet
no
nor
by
the
feet
of
any
normal
animal
the
underworld
had
its
bestial
life
too
perhaps
they
were
behind
him
he
turned
to
face
them
though
he
could
see
nothing
and
slowly
backed
away
then
the
sounds
ceased
even
before
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
somewhere
down
the
long
corridor
a
glow
of
light
in
the
hall
of
the
dead
conan
moved
cautiously
in
the
direction
of
the
light
he
had
seen
his
ear
cocked
over
his
shoulder
but
there
was
no
further
sound
of
pursuit
though
he
the
darkness
pregnant
with
sentient
life
the
glow
was
not
stationary
it
moved
bobbing
grotesquely
along
then
he
saw
the
source
the
tunnel
he
was
traversing
crossed
another
wider
corridor
some
distance
ahead
of
him
and
along
this
latter
tunnel
filed
a
bizarre
procession
four
tall
gaunt
men
in
black
hooded
robes
leaning
on
staffs
the
leader
held
a
torch
above
his
head
a
torch
that
burned
with
a
curious
steady
glow
like
phantoms
they
passed
across
his
limited
range
of
vision
and
vanished
with
only
a
fading
glow
to
tell
of
their
passing
their
appearance
was
indescribably
eldritch
they
were
not
stygians
not
like
anything
conan
had
ever
seen
he
doubted
if
they
were
even
humans
they
were
like
black
ghosts
stalking
ghoulishly
along
the
haunted
tunnels
but
his
position
could
be
no
more
desperate
than
it
was
before
the
inhuman
feet
behind
him
could
resume
their
slithering
advance
at
the
fading
of
the
distant
illumination
conan
was
running
down
the
corridor
he
plunged
into
the
other
tunnel
and
saw
far
down
it
small
in
the
distance
the
weird
procession
moving
in
the
glowing
sphere
he
stole
noiselessly
after
them
then
shrank
suddenly
back
against
the
wall
as
he
saw
them
halt
and
cluster
together
as
if
conferring
on
some
matter
they
turned
as
if
to
retrace
their
steps
and
he
slipped
into
the
nearest
archway
groping
in
the
darkness
to
which
he
had
become
so
accustomed
that
he
could
all
but
see
through
it
he
discovered
that
the
tunnel
did
not
run
straight
but
meandered
and
he
fell
back
beyond
the
first
turn
so
that
the
light
of
the
strangers
should
not
fall
on
him
as
they
passed
but
as
he
stood
there
he
was
aware
of
a
low
hum
of
sound
from
somewhere
behind
him
like
the
murmur
of
human
voices
moving
down
the
corridor
in
that
direction
he
confirmed
his
first
suspicion
abandoning
his
original
intention
of
following
the
ghoulish
travelers
to
whatever
destination
might
be
theirs
he
set
out
in
the
direction
of
the
voices
presently
he
saw
a
glint
of
light
ahead
of
him
and
turning
into
the
corridor
from
which
it
issued
saw
a
broad
arch
filled
with
a
dim
glow
at
the
other
end
on
his
left
a
narrow
stone
stair
went
upward
and
instinctive
caution
prompted
him
to
turn
and
mount
the
stair
the
voices
he
heard
were
coming
from
beyond
that
arch
the
sounds
fell
away
beneath
him
as
he
climbed
and
presently
he
came
out
through
a
low
arched
door
into
a
vast
open
space
glowing
with
a
weird
radiance
he
was
standing
on
a
shadowy
gallery
from
which
he
looked
down
into
a
broad
hall
of
colossal
proportions
it
was
a
hall
of
the
dead
which
few
ever
see
but
the
silent
priests
of
stygia
along
the
black
walls
rose
tier
above
tier
of
carven
painted
sarcophagi
each
stood
in
a
niche
in
the
dusky
stone
and
the
tiers
mounted
up
and
up
to
be
lost
in
the
gloom
above
thousands
of
carven
masks
stared
impassively
down
upon
the
group
in
the
midst
of
the
hall
rendered
futile
and
insignificant
by
that
vast
array
of
the
dead
of
this
group
ten
were
priests
and
though
they
had
discarded
their
masks
conan
knew
they
were
the
priests
he
had
accompanied
to
the
pyramid
they
stood
before
a
tall
man
beside
a
black
altar
on
which
lay
a
mummy
in
rotting
swathings
and
the
altar
seemed
to
stand
in
the
heart
of
a
living
fire
which
pulsed
and
shimmered
dripping
flakes
of
quivering
golden
flame
on
the
black
stones
about
it
this
dazzling
glow
emanated
from
a
great
red
jewel
which
lay
upon
the
altar
and
in
the
reflection
of
which
the
faces
of
the
priests
looked
ashy
and
as
he
looked
conan
felt
the
pressure
of
all
the
weary
leagues
and
the
weary
nights
and
days
of
his
long
quest
and
he
trembled
with
the
mad
urge
to
rush
among
those
silent
priests
clear
his
way
with
mighty
blows
of
naked
steel
and
grasp
the
red
gem
with
fingers
but
he
gripped
himself
with
iron
control
and
crouched
down
in
the
shadow
of
the
stone
balustrade
a
glance
showed
him
that
a
stair
led
down
into
the
hall
from
the
gallery
hugging
the
wall
and
half
hidden
in
the
shadows
he
glared
into
the
dimness
of
the
vast
place
seeking
other
priests
or
votaries
but
saw
only
the
group
about
the
altar
in
that
great
emptiness
the
voice
of
the
man
beside
the
altar
sounded
hollow
and
ghostly
and
so
the
word
came
southward
the
night
wind
whispered
it
the
ravens
croaked
of
it
as
they
flew
and
the
grim
bats
told
it
to
the
owls
and
the
serpents
that
lurk
in
hoary
ruins
werewolf
and
vampire
knew
and
the
demons
that
prowl
by
night
the
sleeping
night
of
the
world
stirred
and
shook
its
heavy
mane
and
there
began
a
throbbing
of
drums
in
deep
darkness
and
the
echoes
of
far
weird
cries
frightened
men
who
walked
by
dusk
for
the
heart
of
ahriman
had
come
again
into
the
world
to
fulfill
its
cryptic
destiny
me
not
how
i
thutothmes
of
khemi
and
the
night
heard
the
word
before
who
calls
himself
prince
of
all
wizards
there
are
secrets
not
meet
for
such
ears
even
as
yours
and
is
not
the
only
lord
of
the
black
ring
knew
and
i
went
to
meet
the
heart
which
came
southward
it
was
like
a
magnet
which
drew
me
unerringly
from
death
to
death
it
came
riding
on
a
river
of
human
blood
blood
feeds
it
blood
draws
it
its
power
is
greatest
when
there
is
blood
on
the
hands
that
grasp
it
when
it
is
wrested
by
slaughter
from
its
holder
wherever
it
gleams
blood
is
spilt
and
kingdoms
totter
and
the
forces
of
nature
are
put
in
turmoil
here
i
stand
the
master
of
the
heart
and
have
summoned
you
to
come
secretly
who
are
faithful
to
me
to
share
in
the
black
kingdom
that
shall
be
tonight
you
shall
witness
the
breaking
of
chains
which
enslave
us
and
the
birth
of
empire
am
i
even
i
thutothmes
to
know
what
powers
lurk
and
dream
in
those
crimson
deeps
it
holds
secrets
forgotten
for
three
thousand
years
but
i
shall
learn
these
shall
tell
me
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
silent
shapes
that
lined
the
hall
how
they
sleep
staring
through
their
carven
masks
kings
queens
generals
priests
wizards
the
dynasties
and
the
nobility
of
stygia
for
ten
thousand
years
the
touch
of
the
heart
will
awaken
them
from
their
long
slumber
long
long
the
heart
throbbed
and
pulsed
in
ancient
stygia
here
was
its
home
in
the
centuries
before
it
journeyed
to
acheron
the
ancients
knew
its
full
power
and
they
will
tell
me
when
by
its
magic
i
restore
them
to
life
to
labor
for
me
will
rouse
them
will
waken
them
will
learn
their
forgotten
wisdom
the
knowledge
locked
in
those
withered
skulls
by
the
lore
of
the
dead
we
shall
enslave
the
living
aye
kings
and
generals
and
wizards
of
old
shall
be
our
helpers
and
our
slaves
who
shall
stand
before
us
this
dried
shriveled
thing
on
the
altar
was
once
thothmekri
a
high
priest
of
set
who
died
three
thousand
years
ago
he
was
an
adept
of
the
black
ring
he
knew
of
the
heart
he
will
tell
us
of
its
powers
lifting
the
great
jewel
the
speaker
laid
it
on
the
withered
breast
of
the
mummy
and
lifted
his
hand
as
he
began
an
incantation
but
the
incantation
was
never
finished
with
his
hand
lifted
and
his
lips
parted
he
froze
glaring
past
his
acolytes
and
they
wheeled
to
stare
in
the
direction
in
which
he
was
looking
through
the
black
arch
of
a
door
four
gaunt
shapes
had
filed
into
the
great
hall
their
faces
were
dim
yellow
ovals
in
the
shadow
of
their
hoods
are
you
ejaculated
thutothmes
in
a
voice
as
pregnant
with
danger
as
the
hiss
of
a
cobra
you
mad
to
invade
the
holy
shrine
of
set
the
tallest
of
the
strangers
spoke
and
his
voice
was
toneless
as
a
khitan
temple
bell
follow
conan
of
aquilonia
is
not
here
answered
thutothmes
shaking
back
his
mantle
from
his
right
hand
with
a
curious
menacing
gesture
like
a
panther
unsheathing
his
talons
lie
he
is
in
this
temple
we
tracked
him
from
a
corpse
behind
the
bronze
door
of
the
outer
portal
through
a
maze
of
corridors
we
were
following
his
devious
trail
when
we
became
aware
of
this
conclave
we
go
now
to
take
it
up
again
but
first
give
us
the
heart
of
ahriman
is
the
portion
of
madmen
murmured
thutothmes
moving
nearer
the
speaker
his
priests
closed
in
on
feet
but
the
strangers
did
not
appear
to
heed
can
look
upon
it
without
desire
said
the
khitan
khitai
we
have
heard
of
it
it
will
give
us
power
over
the
people
which
cast
us
out
glory
and
wonder
dream
in
its
crimson
deeps
give
it
to
us
before
we
slay
you
a
fierce
cry
rang
out
as
a
priest
leaped
with
a
flicker
of
steel
before
he
could
strike
a
scaly
staff
licked
out
and
touched
his
breast
and
he
fell
as
a
dead
man
falls
in
an
instant
the
mummies
were
staring
down
on
a
scene
of
blood
and
horror
curved
knives
flashed
and
crimsoned
snaky
staffs
licked
in
and
out
and
whenever
they
touched
a
man
that
man
screamed
and
died
at
the
first
stroke
conan
had
bounded
up
and
was
racing
down
the
stairs
he
caught
only
glimpses
of
that
brief
fiendish
fight
saw
men
swaying
locked
in
battle
and
streaming
blood
saw
one
khitan
fairly
hacked
to
pieces
yet
still
on
his
feet
and
dealing
death
when
thutothmes
smote
him
on
the
breast
with
his
open
empty
hand
and
he
dropped
dead
though
naked
steel
had
not
been
enough
to
destroy
his
uncanny
vitality
by
the
time
conan
hurtling
feet
left
the
stair
the
fight
was
all
but
over
three
of
the
khitans
were
down
slashed
and
cut
to
ribbons
and
disemboweled
but
of
the
stygians
only
thutothmes
remained
on
his
feet
he
rushed
at
the
remaining
khitan
his
empty
hand
lifted
like
a
weapon
and
that
hand
was
black
as
that
of
a
negro
but
before
he
could
strike
the
staff
in
the
tall
khitan
hand
licked
out
seeming
to
elongate
itself
as
the
yellow
man
thrust
the
point
touched
the
bosom
of
thutothmes
and
he
staggered
again
and
yet
again
the
staff
licked
out
and
thutothmes
reeled
and
fell
dead
his
features
blotted
out
in
a
rush
of
blackness
that
made
the
whole
of
him
the
same
hue
as
his
enchanted
hand
the
khitan
turned
toward
the
jewel
that
burned
on
the
breast
of
the
mummy
but
conan
was
before
him
in
a
tense
stillness
the
two
faced
each
other
amid
that
shambles
with
the
carven
mummies
staring
down
upon
them
have
i
followed
you
oh
king
of
aquilonia
said
the
khitan
calmly
the
long
river
and
over
the
mountains
across
poitain
and
zingara
and
through
the
hills
of
argos
and
down
the
coast
not
easily
did
we
pick
up
your
trail
from
tarantia
for
the
priests
of
asura
are
crafty
we
lost
it
in
zingara
but
we
found
your
helmet
in
the
forest
below
the
border
hills
where
you
had
fought
with
the
ghouls
of
the
forests
almost
we
lost
the
trail
again
tonight
among
these
labyrinths
conan
reflected
that
he
had
been
fortunate
in
returning
from
the
vampire
chamber
by
another
route
than
that
by
which
he
had
been
led
to
it
otherwise
he
would
have
run
full
into
these
yellow
fiends
instead
of
sighting
them
from
afar
as
they
smelled
out
his
spoor
like
human
bloodhounds
with
whatever
uncanny
gift
was
theirs
the
khitan
shook
his
head
slightly
as
if
reading
his
mind
is
meaningless
the
long
trail
ends
here
have
you
hounded
me
demanded
conan
poised
to
move
in
any
direction
with
the
celerity
of
a
was
a
debt
to
pay
answered
the
khitan
you
who
are
about
to
die
i
will
not
withhold
knowledge
we
were
vassals
of
the
king
of
aquilonia
valerius
long
we
served
him
but
of
that
service
we
are
free
now
my
brothers
by
death
and
i
by
the
fulfilment
of
obligation
i
shall
return
to
aquilonia
with
two
hearts
for
myself
the
heart
of
ahriman
for
valerius
the
heart
of
conan
a
kiss
of
the
staff
that
was
cut
from
the
living
tree
of
death
the
staff
licked
out
like
the
dart
of
a
viper
but
the
slash
of
knife
was
quicker
the
staff
fell
in
writhing
halves
there
was
another
flicker
of
the
keen
steel
like
a
jet
of
lightning
and
the
head
of
the
khitan
rolled
to
the
floor
conan
wheeled
and
extended
his
hand
toward
the
jewel
then
he
shrank
back
his
hair
bristling
his
blood
congealing
icily
for
no
longer
a
withered
brown
thing
lay
on
the
altar
the
jewel
shimmered
on
the
full
arching
breast
of
a
naked
living
man
who
lay
among
the
moldering
bandages
living
conan
could
not
decide
the
eyes
were
like
dark
murky
glass
under
which
shone
inhuman
somber
fires
slowly
the
man
rose
taking
the
jewel
in
his
hand
he
towered
beside
the
altar
dusky
naked
with
a
face
like
a
carven
image
mutely
he
extended
his
hand
toward
conan
with
the
jewel
throbbing
like
a
living
heart
within
it
conan
took
it
with
an
eery
sensation
of
receiving
gifts
from
the
hand
of
the
dead
he
somehow
realized
that
the
proper
incantations
had
not
been
made
the
conjurement
had
not
been
completed
life
had
not
been
fully
restored
to
his
corpse
are
you
demanded
the
cimmerian
the
answer
came
in
a
toneless
monotone
like
the
dripping
of
water
from
stalactites
in
subterranean
caverns
was
thothmekri
i
am
dead
lead
me
out
of
this
accursed
temple
will
you
conan
requested
his
flesh
crawling
with
measured
mechanical
steps
the
dead
man
moved
toward
a
black
arch
conan
followed
him
a
glance
back
showed
him
once
again
the
vast
shadowy
hall
with
its
tiers
of
sarcophagi
the
dead
men
sprawled
about
the
altar
the
head
of
the
khitan
he
had
slain
stared
sightless
up
at
the
sweeping
shadows
the
glow
of
the
jewel
illuminated
the
black
tunnels
like
an
ensorceled
lamp
dripping
golden
fire
once
conan
caught
a
glimpse
of
ivory
flesh
in
the
shadows
believed
he
saw
the
vampire
that
was
akivasha
shrinking
back
from
the
glow
of
the
jewel
and
with
her
other
less
human
shapes
scuttled
or
shambled
into
the
darkness
the
dead
man
strode
straight
on
looking
neither
to
right
nor
left
his
pace
as
changeless
as
the
tramp
of
doom
cold
sweat
gathered
thick
on
conan
flesh
icy
doubts
assailed
him
how
could
he
know
that
this
terrible
figure
out
of
the
past
was
leading
him
to
freedom
but
he
knew
that
left
to
himself
he
could
never
untangle
this
bewitched
maze
of
corridors
and
tunnels
he
followed
his
awful
guide
through
blackness
that
loomed
before
and
behind
them
and
was
filled
with
skulking
shapes
of
horror
and
lunacy
that
cringed
from
the
blinding
glow
of
the
heart
then
the
bronze
doorway
was
before
him
and
conan
felt
the
night
wind
blowing
across
the
desert
and
saw
the
stars
and
the
starlit
desert
across
which
streamed
the
great
black
shadow
of
the
pyramid
thothmekri
pointed
silently
into
the
desert
and
then
turned
and
stalked
soundlessly
back
in
the
darkness
conan
stared
after
that
silent
figure
that
receded
into
the
blackness
on
soundless
inexorable
feet
as
one
that
moves
to
a
known
and
inevitable
doom
or
returns
to
everlasting
sleep
with
a
curse
the
cimmerian
leaped
from
the
doorway
and
fled
into
the
desert
as
if
pursued
by
demons
he
did
not
look
back
toward
the
pyramid
or
toward
the
black
towers
of
khemi
looming
dimly
across
the
sands
he
headed
southward
toward
the
coast
and
he
ran
as
a
man
runs
in
ungovernable
panic
the
violent
exertion
shook
his
brain
free
of
black
cobwebs
the
clean
desert
wind
blew
the
nightmares
from
his
soul
and
his
revulsion
changed
to
a
wild
tide
of
exultation
before
the
desert
gave
way
to
a
tangle
of
swampy
growth
through
which
he
saw
the
black
water
lying
before
him
and
the
at
anchor
he
plunged
through
the
undergrowth
in
the
marshes
dived
headlong
into
the
deep
water
heedless
of
sharks
or
crocodiles
and
swam
to
the
galley
and
was
clambering
up
the
chain
on
to
the
deck
dripping
and
exultant
before
the
watch
saw
him
you
dogs
roared
conan
knocking
aside
the
spear
the
startled
lookout
thrust
at
his
breast
up
the
anchor
lay
to
the
doors
give
that
fisherman
a
helmet
full
of
gold
and
put
him
ashore
dawn
will
soon
be
breaking
and
before
sunrise
we
must
be
racing
for
the
nearest
port
of
zingara
he
whirled
about
his
head
the
great
jewel
which
threw
off
splashes
of
light
that
spotted
the
deck
with
golden
fire
out
of
the
dust
shall
acheron
arise
winter
had
passed
from
aquilonia
leaves
sprang
out
on
the
limbs
of
trees
and
the
fresh
grass
smiled
to
the
touch
of
the
warm
southern
breezes
but
many
a
field
lay
idle
and
empty
many
a
charred
heap
of
ashes
marked
the
spot
where
proud
villas
or
prosperous
towns
had
stood
wolves
prowled
openly
along
the
highways
and
bands
of
gaunt
masterless
men
slunk
through
the
forests
only
in
tarantia
was
feasting
and
wealth
and
pageantry
valerius
ruled
like
one
touched
with
madness
even
many
of
the
barons
who
had
welcomed
his
return
cried
out
at
last
against
him
his
crushed
rich
and
poor
alike
the
wealth
of
a
looted
kingdom
poured
into
tarantia
which
became
less
like
the
capital
of
a
realm
than
the
garrison
of
conquerors
in
a
conquered
land
its
merchants
waxed
rich
but
it
was
a
precarious
prosperity
for
none
knew
when
he
might
be
accused
of
treason
on
a
charge
and
his
property
confiscated
himself
cast
into
prison
or
brought
to
the
bloody
block
valerius
made
no
attempt
to
conciliate
his
subjects
he
maintained
himself
by
means
of
the
nemedian
soldiery
and
by
desperate
mercenaries
he
knew
himself
to
be
a
puppet
of
amalric
he
knew
that
he
ruled
only
on
the
sufferance
of
the
nemedian
he
knew
that
he
could
never
hope
to
unite
aquilonia
under
his
rule
and
cast
off
the
yoke
of
his
masters
for
the
outland
provinces
would
resist
him
to
the
last
drop
of
blood
and
for
that
matter
the
nemedians
would
cast
him
from
his
throne
if
he
made
any
attempt
to
consolidate
his
kingdom
he
was
caught
in
his
own
vise
the
gall
of
defeated
pride
corroded
his
soul
and
he
threw
himself
into
a
reign
of
debauchery
as
one
who
lives
from
day
to
day
without
thought
or
care
for
tomorrow
yet
there
was
subtlety
in
his
madness
so
deep
that
not
even
amalric
guessed
it
perhaps
the
wild
chaotic
years
of
wandering
as
an
exile
had
bred
in
him
a
bitterness
beyond
common
conception
perhaps
his
loathing
of
his
present
position
increased
this
bitterness
to
a
kind
of
madness
at
any
event
he
lived
with
one
desire
to
cause
the
ruin
of
all
who
associated
with
him
he
knew
that
his
rule
would
be
over
the
instant
he
had
served
purpose
he
knew
too
that
so
long
as
he
continued
to
oppress
his
native
kingdom
the
nemedian
would
suffer
him
to
reign
for
amalric
wished
to
crush
aquilonia
into
ultimate
submission
to
destroy
its
last
shred
of
independence
and
then
at
last
to
seize
it
himself
rebuild
it
after
his
own
fashion
with
his
vast
wealth
and
use
its
men
and
natural
resources
to
wrest
the
crown
of
nemedia
from
tarascus
for
the
throne
of
an
emperor
was
amalric
ultimate
ambition
and
valerius
knew
it
valerius
did
not
know
whether
tarascus
suspected
this
but
he
knew
that
the
king
of
nemedia
approved
of
his
ruthless
course
tarascus
hated
aquilonia
with
a
hate
born
of
old
wars
he
desired
only
the
destruction
of
the
western
kingdom
and
valerius
intended
to
ruin
the
country
so
utterly
that
not
even
amalric
wealth
could
ever
rebuild
it
he
hated
the
baron
quite
as
much
as
he
hated
the
aquilonians
and
hoped
only
to
live
to
see
the
day
when
aquilonia
lay
in
utter
ruin
and
tarascus
and
amalric
were
locked
in
hopeless
civil
war
that
would
as
completely
destroy
nemedia
he
believed
that
the
conquest
of
the
still
defiant
provinces
of
gunderland
and
poitain
and
the
bossonian
marches
would
mark
his
end
as
king
he
would
then
have
served
amalric
purpose
and
could
be
discarded
so
he
delayed
the
conquest
of
these
provinces
confining
his
activities
to
objectless
raids
and
forays
meeting
amalric
urges
for
action
with
all
sorts
of
plausible
objections
and
postponements
his
life
was
a
series
of
feasts
and
wild
debauches
he
filled
his
palace
with
the
fairest
girls
of
the
kingdom
willing
or
unwilling
he
blasphemed
the
gods
and
sprawled
drunken
on
the
floor
of
the
banquet
hall
wearing
the
golden
crown
and
staining
his
royal
purple
robes
with
the
wine
he
spilled
in
gusts
of
he
festooned
the
gallows
in
the
market
square
with
dangling
corpses
glutted
the
axes
of
the
headsmen
and
sent
his
nemedian
horsemen
thundering
through
the
land
pillaging
and
burning
driven
to
madness
the
land
was
in
a
constant
upheaval
of
frantic
revolt
savagely
suppressed
valerius
plundered
and
raped
and
looted
and
destroyed
until
even
amalric
protested
warning
him
that
he
would
beggar
the
kingdom
beyond
repair
not
knowing
that
such
was
his
fixed
determination
but
while
in
both
aquilonia
and
nemedia
men
talked
of
the
madness
of
the
king
in
nemedia
men
talked
much
of
xaltotun
the
masked
one
yet
few
saw
him
on
the
streets
of
belverus
men
said
he
spent
much
time
in
the
hills
in
curious
conclaves
with
surviving
remnants
of
an
old
race
dark
silent
folk
who
claimed
descent
from
an
ancient
kingdom
men
whispered
of
drums
beating
far
up
in
the
dreaming
hills
of
fires
glowing
in
the
darkness
and
strange
chantings
borne
on
the
winds
chantings
and
rituals
forgotten
centuries
ago
except
as
meaningless
formulas
mumbled
beside
mountain
hearths
in
villages
whose
inhabitants
differed
strangely
from
the
people
of
the
valleys
the
reason
for
these
conclaves
none
knew
unless
it
was
orastes
who
frequently
accompanied
the
pythonian
and
on
whose
countenance
a
haggard
shadow
was
growing
but
in
the
full
flood
of
spring
a
sudden
whisper
passed
over
the
sinking
kingdom
that
woke
the
land
to
eager
life
it
came
like
a
murmurous
wind
drifting
up
from
the
south
waking
men
sunk
in
the
apathy
of
despair
yet
how
it
first
came
none
could
truly
say
some
spoke
of
a
strange
grim
old
woman
who
came
down
from
the
mountains
with
her
hair
flowing
in
the
wind
and
a
great
gray
wolf
following
her
like
a
dog
others
whispered
of
the
priests
of
asura
who
stole
like
furtive
phantoms
from
gunderland
to
the
marches
of
poitain
and
to
the
forest
villages
of
the
bossonians
however
the
word
came
revolt
ran
like
a
flame
along
the
borders
outlying
nemedian
garrisons
were
stormed
and
put
to
the
sword
foraging
parties
were
cut
to
pieces
the
west
was
up
in
arms
and
there
was
a
different
air
about
the
rising
a
fierce
resolution
and
inspired
wrath
rather
than
the
frantic
despair
that
had
motivated
the
preceding
revolts
it
was
not
only
the
common
people
barons
were
fortifying
their
castles
and
hurling
defiance
at
the
governors
of
the
provinces
bands
of
bossonians
were
seen
moving
along
the
edges
of
the
marches
stocky
resolute
men
in
brigandines
and
steel
caps
with
longbows
in
their
hands
from
the
inert
stagnation
of
dissolution
and
ruin
the
realm
was
suddenly
alive
vibrant
and
dangerous
so
amalric
sent
in
haste
for
tarascus
who
came
with
an
army
in
the
royal
palace
in
tarantia
the
two
kings
and
amalric
discussed
the
rising
they
had
not
sent
for
xaltotun
immersed
in
his
cryptic
studies
in
the
nemedian
hills
not
since
that
bloody
day
in
the
valley
of
the
valkia
had
they
called
upon
him
for
aid
of
his
magic
and
he
had
drawn
apart
communing
but
little
with
them
apparently
indifferent
to
their
intrigues
nor
had
they
sent
for
orastes
but
he
came
and
he
was
white
as
spume
blown
before
the
storm
he
stood
in
the
chamber
where
the
kings
held
conclave
and
they
beheld
in
amazement
his
haggard
stare
the
fear
they
had
never
guessed
the
mind
of
orastes
could
hold
are
weary
orastes
said
amalric
upon
this
divan
and
i
will
have
a
slave
fetch
you
wine
you
have
ridden
hard
orastes
waved
aside
the
invitation
have
killed
three
horses
on
the
road
from
belverus
i
can
not
drink
wine
i
can
not
rest
until
i
have
said
what
i
have
to
say
he
paced
back
and
forth
as
if
some
inner
fire
would
not
let
him
stand
motionless
and
halting
before
his
wondering
companions
we
employed
the
heart
of
ahriman
to
bring
a
dead
man
back
to
life
orastes
said
abruptly
did
not
weigh
the
consequences
of
tampering
in
the
black
dust
of
the
past
the
fault
is
mine
and
the
sin
we
thought
only
of
our
ambitions
forgetting
what
ambitions
this
man
might
himself
have
and
we
have
loosed
a
demon
upon
the
earth
a
fiend
inexplicable
to
common
humanity
i
have
plumbed
deep
in
evil
but
there
is
a
limit
to
which
i
or
any
man
of
my
race
and
age
can
go
my
ancestors
were
clean
men
without
any
demoniacal
taint
it
is
only
i
who
have
sunk
into
the
pits
and
i
can
sin
only
to
the
extent
of
my
personal
individuality
but
behind
xaltotun
lie
a
thousand
centuries
of
black
magic
and
diabolism
an
ancient
tradition
of
evil
he
is
beyond
our
conception
not
only
because
he
is
a
wizard
himself
but
also
because
he
is
the
son
of
a
race
of
wizards
have
seen
things
that
have
blasted
my
soul
in
the
heart
of
the
slumbering
hills
i
have
watched
xaltotun
commune
with
the
souls
of
the
damned
and
invoke
the
ancient
demons
of
forgotten
acheron
i
have
seen
the
accursed
descendants
of
that
accursed
empire
worship
him
and
hail
him
as
their
i
have
seen
what
he
plots
and
i
tell
you
it
is
no
less
than
the
restoration
of
the
ancient
black
grisly
kingdom
of
acheron
do
you
mean
demanded
amalric
is
dust
there
are
not
enough
survivals
to
make
an
empire
not
even
xaltotun
can
reshape
the
dust
of
three
thousand
years
know
little
of
his
black
powers
answered
orastes
grimly
have
seen
the
very
hills
take
on
an
alien
and
ancient
aspect
under
the
spell
of
his
incantations
i
have
glimpsed
like
shadows
behind
the
realities
the
dim
shapes
and
outlines
of
valleys
forests
mountains
and
lakes
that
are
not
as
they
are
today
but
as
they
were
in
that
dim
yesterday
have
even
sensed
rather
than
glimpsed
the
purple
towers
of
forgotten
python
shimmering
like
figures
of
mist
in
the
dusk
in
the
last
conclave
to
which
i
accompanied
him
understanding
of
his
sorcery
came
to
me
at
last
while
the
drums
beat
and
the
worshippers
howled
with
their
heads
in
the
dust
i
tell
you
he
would
restore
acheron
by
his
magic
by
the
sorcery
of
a
gigantic
such
as
the
world
has
never
seen
he
would
enslave
the
world
and
with
a
deluge
of
blood
away
the
present
and
restore
the
are
mad
exclaimed
tarascus
orastes
turned
a
haggard
stare
upon
him
any
man
see
what
i
have
seen
and
remain
wholly
sane
yet
i
speak
the
truth
he
plots
the
return
of
acheron
with
its
towers
and
wizards
and
kings
and
horrors
as
it
was
in
the
long
ago
the
descendants
of
acheron
will
serve
him
as
a
nucleus
upon
which
to
build
but
it
is
the
blood
and
the
bodies
of
the
people
of
the
world
today
that
will
furnish
the
mortar
and
the
stones
for
the
rebuilding
i
can
not
tell
you
how
my
own
brain
reels
when
i
try
to
understand
i
have
seen
acheron
will
be
acheron
again
and
even
the
hills
the
forests
and
the
rivers
will
resume
their
ancient
aspect
why
not
if
i
with
my
tiny
store
of
knowledge
could
bring
to
life
a
man
dead
three
thousand
years
why
can
not
the
greatest
wizard
of
the
world
bring
back
to
life
a
kingdom
dead
three
thousand
years
out
of
the
dust
shall
acheron
arise
at
his
bidding
can
we
thwart
him
asked
tarascus
impressed
is
but
one
way
answered
orastes
must
steal
the
heart
of
ahriman
i
began
tarascus
involuntarily
then
closed
his
mouth
quickly
none
had
noticed
him
and
orastes
was
continuing
is
a
power
that
can
be
used
against
him
with
it
in
my
hands
i
might
defy
him
but
how
shall
we
steal
it
he
has
it
hidden
in
some
secret
place
from
which
not
even
a
zamorian
thief
might
filch
it
i
can
not
learn
its
if
he
would
only
sleep
again
the
sleep
of
the
black
lotus
but
the
last
time
he
slept
thus
was
after
the
battle
of
the
valkia
when
he
was
weary
because
of
the
great
magic
he
had
performed
and
the
door
was
locked
and
bolted
but
it
swung
silently
open
and
xaltotun
stood
before
them
calm
tranquil
stroking
his
patriarchal
beard
but
the
lambent
lights
of
hell
flickered
in
his
eyes
have
taught
you
too
much
he
said
calmly
pointing
a
finger
like
an
index
of
doom
at
orastes
and
before
any
could
move
he
had
cast
a
handful
of
dust
on
the
floor
near
the
feet
of
the
priest
who
stood
like
a
man
turned
to
marble
it
flamed
smoldered
a
blue
serpentine
of
smoke
rose
and
swayed
upward
about
orastes
in
a
slender
spiral
and
when
it
had
risen
above
his
shoulders
it
curled
about
his
neck
with
a
whipping
suddenness
like
the
stroke
of
a
snake
orastes
scream
was
choked
to
a
gurgle
his
hands
flew
to
his
neck
his
eyes
were
distended
his
tongue
protruded
the
smoke
was
like
a
blue
rope
about
his
neck
then
it
faded
and
was
gone
and
orastes
slumped
to
the
floor
a
dead
man
xaltotun
smote
his
hands
together
and
two
men
entered
men
often
observed
accompanying
him
small
repulsively
dark
with
red
oblique
eyes
and
pointed
teeth
they
did
not
speak
lifting
the
corpse
they
bore
it
away
dismissing
the
matter
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
xaltotun
seated
himself
at
the
ivory
table
about
which
sat
the
pale
kings
are
you
in
conclave
he
demanded
aquilonians
have
risen
in
the
west
answered
amalric
recovering
from
the
grisly
jolt
the
death
of
orastes
had
given
him
fools
believe
that
conan
is
alive
and
coming
at
the
head
of
a
poitanian
army
to
reclaim
his
kingdom
if
he
had
reappeared
immediately
after
valkia
or
if
a
rumor
had
been
circulated
that
he
lived
the
central
provinces
would
not
have
risen
under
him
they
feared
your
powers
so
but
they
have
become
so
desperate
under
valerius
misrule
that
they
are
ready
to
follow
any
man
who
can
unite
them
against
us
and
prefer
sudden
death
to
torture
and
continual
misery
course
the
tale
has
lingered
stubbornly
in
the
land
that
conan
was
not
really
slain
at
valkia
but
not
until
recently
have
the
masses
accepted
it
but
pallantides
is
back
from
exile
in
ophir
swearing
that
the
king
was
ill
in
his
tent
that
day
and
that
a
wore
his
harness
and
a
squire
who
but
recently
recovered
from
the
stroke
of
a
mace
received
at
valkia
confirms
his
tale
or
pretends
to
old
woman
with
a
pet
wolf
has
wandered
up
and
down
the
land
proclaiming
that
king
conan
yet
lives
and
will
return
some
day
to
reclaim
the
crown
and
of
late
the
cursed
priests
of
asura
sing
the
same
song
they
claim
that
word
has
come
to
them
by
some
mysterious
means
that
conan
is
returning
to
reconquer
his
domain
i
can
not
catch
either
her
or
them
this
is
of
course
a
trick
of
trocero
my
spies
tell
me
there
is
indisputable
evidence
that
the
poitanians
are
gathering
to
invade
aquilonia
i
believe
that
trocero
will
bring
forward
some
pretender
who
he
will
claim
is
king
conan
tarascus
laughed
but
there
was
no
conviction
in
his
laughter
he
surreptitiously
felt
of
a
scar
beneath
his
jupon
and
remembered
ravens
that
cawed
on
the
trail
of
a
fugitive
remembered
the
body
of
his
squire
arideus
brought
back
from
the
border
mountains
horribly
mangled
by
a
great
gray
wolf
his
terrified
soldiers
said
but
he
also
remembered
a
red
jewel
stolen
from
a
golden
chest
while
a
wizard
slept
and
he
said
nothing
and
valerius
remembered
a
dying
nobleman
who
gasped
out
a
tale
of
fear
and
he
remembered
four
khitans
who
disappeared
into
the
mazes
of
the
south
and
never
returned
but
he
held
his
tongue
for
hatred
and
suspicion
of
his
allies
ate
at
him
like
a
worm
and
he
desired
nothing
so
much
as
to
see
both
rebels
and
nemedians
go
down
locked
in
the
death
grip
but
amalric
exclaimed
is
absurd
to
dream
that
conan
lives
for
answer
xaltotun
cast
a
roll
of
parchment
on
the
table
amalric
caught
it
up
glared
at
it
from
his
lips
burst
a
furious
incoherent
cry
he
read
xaltotun
grand
fakir
of
nemedia
dog
of
acheron
i
am
returning
to
my
kingdom
and
i
mean
to
hang
your
hide
on
a
conan
forgery
exclaimed
amalric
xaltotun
shook
his
head
is
genuine
i
have
compared
it
with
the
signature
on
the
royal
documents
on
record
in
the
libraries
of
the
court
none
could
imitate
that
bold
scrawl
if
conan
lives
muttered
amalric
uprising
will
not
be
like
the
others
for
he
is
the
only
man
living
who
can
unite
the
aquilonians
but
he
protested
is
not
like
conan
why
should
he
put
us
on
our
guard
with
his
boasting
one
would
think
that
he
would
strike
without
warning
after
the
fashion
of
the
barbarians
are
already
warned
pointed
out
xaltotun
spies
have
told
us
of
preparations
for
war
in
poitain
he
could
not
cross
the
mountains
without
our
knowledge
so
he
sends
me
his
defiance
in
characteristic
manner
to
you
demanded
valerius
not
to
me
or
to
tarascus
xaltotun
turned
his
inscrutable
gaze
upon
the
king
is
wiser
than
you
he
said
at
last
already
knows
what
you
kings
have
yet
to
learn
that
it
is
not
tarascus
nor
valerius
no
nor
amalric
but
xaltotun
who
is
the
real
master
of
the
western
nations
they
did
not
reply
they
sat
staring
at
him
assailed
by
a
numbing
realization
of
the
truth
of
his
assertion
is
no
road
for
me
but
the
imperial
highway
said
xaltotun
first
we
must
crush
conan
i
do
not
know
how
he
escaped
me
at
belverus
for
knowledge
of
what
happened
while
i
lay
in
the
slumber
of
the
black
lotus
is
denied
me
but
he
is
in
the
south
gathering
an
army
it
is
his
last
desperate
blow
made
possible
only
by
the
desperation
of
the
people
who
have
suffered
under
valerius
let
them
rise
i
hold
them
all
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
we
will
wait
until
he
moves
against
us
and
then
we
will
crush
him
once
and
for
all
we
shall
crush
poitain
and
gunderland
and
the
stupid
bossonians
after
them
ophir
argos
zingara
koth
all
the
nations
of
the
world
we
shall
weld
into
one
vast
empire
you
shall
rule
as
my
satraps
and
as
my
captains
shall
be
greater
than
kings
are
now
i
am
unconquerable
for
the
heart
of
ahriman
is
hidden
where
no
man
can
ever
wield
it
against
me
again
tarascus
averted
his
gaze
lest
xaltotun
read
his
thoughts
he
knew
the
wizard
had
not
looked
into
the
golden
chest
with
its
carven
serpents
that
had
seemed
to
sleep
since
he
laid
the
heart
therein
strange
as
it
seemed
xaltotun
did
not
know
that
the
heart
had
been
stolen
the
strange
jewel
was
beyond
or
outside
the
ring
of
his
dark
wisdom
his
uncanny
talents
did
not
warn
him
that
the
chest
was
empty
tarascus
did
not
believe
that
xaltotun
knew
the
full
extent
of
orastes
revelations
for
the
pythonian
had
not
mentioned
the
restoration
of
acheron
but
only
the
building
of
a
new
earthly
empire
tarascus
did
not
believe
that
xaltotun
was
yet
quite
sure
of
his
power
if
they
needed
his
aid
in
their
ambitions
no
less
he
needed
theirs
magic
depended
to
a
certain
extent
after
all
on
sword
strokes
and
lance
thrusts
the
king
read
meaning
in
amalric
furtive
glance
let
the
wizard
use
his
arts
to
help
them
defeat
their
most
dangerous
enemy
time
enough
then
to
turn
against
him
there
might
yet
be
a
way
to
cheat
this
dark
power
they
had
raised
drums
of
peril
confirmation
of
the
war
came
when
the
army
of
poitain
ten
thousand
strong
marched
through
the
southern
passes
with
waving
banners
and
shimmer
of
steel
and
at
their
head
the
spies
swore
rode
a
giant
figure
in
black
armor
with
the
royal
lion
of
aquilonia
worked
in
gold
upon
the
breast
of
his
rich
silken
surcoat
conan
lived
the
king
lived
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
in
men
minds
now
whether
friend
or
foe
with
the
news
of
the
invasion
from
the
south
there
also
came
word
brought
by
couriers
that
a
host
of
gundermen
was
moving
southward
reinforced
by
the
barons
of
the
northwest
and
the
northern
bossonians
tarascus
marched
with
thousand
men
to
galparan
on
the
river
shirki
which
the
gundermen
must
cross
to
strike
at
the
towns
still
held
by
the
nemedians
the
shirki
was
a
swift
turbulent
river
rushing
southwestward
through
rocky
gorges
and
canyons
and
there
were
few
places
where
an
army
could
cross
at
that
time
of
the
year
when
the
stream
was
almost
with
the
melting
of
the
snows
all
the
country
east
of
the
shirki
was
in
the
hands
of
the
nemedians
and
it
was
logical
to
assume
that
the
gundermen
would
attempt
to
cross
either
at
galparan
or
at
tanasul
which
lay
to
the
south
of
galparan
reinforcements
were
daily
expected
from
nemedia
until
word
came
that
the
king
of
ophir
was
making
hostile
demonstrations
on
southern
border
and
to
spare
any
more
troops
would
be
to
expose
nemedia
to
the
risk
of
an
invasion
from
the
south
amalric
and
valerius
moved
out
from
tarantia
with
thousand
men
leaving
as
large
a
garrison
as
they
dared
to
discourage
revolts
in
the
cities
during
their
absence
they
wished
to
meet
and
crush
conan
before
he
could
be
joined
by
the
rebellious
forces
of
the
kingdom
the
king
and
his
poitanians
had
crossed
the
mountains
but
there
had
been
no
actual
clash
of
arms
no
attack
on
towns
or
fortresses
conan
had
appeared
and
disappeared
apparently
he
had
turned
westward
through
the
wild
thinly
settled
hill
country
and
entered
the
bossonian
marches
gathering
recruits
as
he
went
amalric
and
valerius
with
their
host
nemedians
aquilonian
renegades
and
ferocious
mercenaries
moved
through
the
land
in
baffled
wrath
looking
for
a
foe
which
did
not
appear
amalric
found
it
impossible
to
obtain
more
than
vague
general
tidings
about
conan
movements
had
a
way
of
riding
out
and
never
returning
and
it
was
not
uncommon
to
find
a
spy
crucified
to
an
oak
the
countryside
was
up
and
striking
as
peasants
and
strike
savagely
murderously
and
secretly
all
that
amalric
knew
certainly
was
that
a
large
force
of
gundermen
and
northern
bossonians
was
somewhere
to
the
north
of
him
beyond
the
shirki
and
that
conan
with
a
smaller
force
of
poitanians
and
southern
bossonians
was
somewhere
to
the
southwest
of
him
he
began
to
grow
fearful
that
if
he
and
valerius
advanced
further
into
the
wild
country
conan
might
elude
them
entirely
march
around
them
and
invade
the
central
provinces
behind
them
amalric
fell
back
from
the
shirki
valley
and
camped
in
a
plain
a
day
ride
from
tanasul
there
he
waited
tarascus
maintained
his
position
at
galparan
for
he
feared
that
conan
maneuvers
were
intended
to
draw
him
southward
and
so
let
the
gundermen
into
the
kingdom
at
the
northern
crossing
to
amalric
camp
came
xaltotun
in
his
chariot
drawn
by
the
uncanny
horses
that
never
tired
and
he
entered
amalric
tent
where
the
baron
conferred
with
valerius
over
a
map
spread
on
an
ivory
camp
table
this
map
xaltotun
crumpled
and
flung
aside
your
scouts
can
not
learn
for
you
quoth
he
spies
tell
me
though
their
information
is
strangely
blurred
and
imperfect
as
if
unseen
forces
were
working
against
me
is
advancing
along
the
shirki
river
with
ten
thousand
poitanians
three
thousand
southern
bossonians
and
barons
of
the
west
and
south
with
their
retainers
to
the
number
of
five
thousand
an
army
of
thirty
thousand
gundermen
and
northern
bossonians
is
pushing
southward
to
join
him
they
have
established
contact
by
means
of
secret
communications
used
by
the
cursed
priests
of
asura
who
seem
to
be
opposing
me
and
whom
i
will
feed
to
a
serpent
when
the
battle
is
over
i
swear
it
by
set
armies
are
headed
for
the
crossing
at
tanasul
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
gundermen
will
cross
the
river
i
believe
that
conan
will
cross
instead
and
join
them
should
conan
cross
the
river
it
is
to
his
advantage
to
delay
the
battle
the
longer
he
waits
the
stronger
he
will
become
the
more
precarious
our
position
the
hills
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
swarm
with
people
passionately
loyal
to
his
cause
broken
men
refugees
fugitives
from
cruelty
from
all
over
the
kingdom
men
are
hurrying
to
join
his
army
singly
and
by
companies
daily
parties
from
our
armies
are
ambushed
and
cut
to
pieces
by
the
revolt
grows
in
the
central
provinces
and
will
soon
burst
into
open
rebellion
the
garrisons
we
left
there
are
not
sufficient
and
we
can
hope
for
no
reinforcements
from
nemedia
for
the
time
being
i
see
the
hand
of
pallantides
in
this
brawling
on
the
ophirean
frontier
he
has
kin
in
ophir
we
do
not
catch
and
crush
conan
quickly
the
provinces
will
be
in
a
blaze
of
revolt
behind
us
we
shall
have
to
fall
back
to
tarantia
to
defend
what
we
have
taken
and
we
may
have
to
fight
our
way
through
a
country
in
rebellion
with
conan
whole
force
at
our
heels
and
then
stand
siege
in
the
city
itself
with
enemies
within
as
well
as
without
no
we
can
not
wait
we
must
crush
conan
before
his
army
grows
too
great
before
the
central
provinces
rise
with
his
head
hanging
above
the
gate
at
tarantia
you
will
see
how
quickly
the
rebellion
will
fall
apart
do
you
not
put
a
spell
on
his
army
to
slay
them
all
asked
valerius
half
in
mockery
xaltotun
stared
at
the
aquilonian
as
if
he
read
the
full
extent
of
the
mocking
madness
that
lurked
in
those
wayward
eyes
not
worry
he
said
at
last
arts
shall
crush
conan
finally
like
a
lizard
under
the
heel
but
even
sorcery
is
aided
by
pikes
and
swords
he
crosses
the
river
and
takes
up
his
position
in
the
goralian
hills
he
may
be
hard
to
dislodge
said
amalric
if
we
catch
him
in
the
valley
on
this
side
of
the
river
we
can
wipe
him
out
how
far
is
conan
from
tanasul
the
rate
he
is
marching
he
should
reach
the
crossing
sometime
tomorrow
night
his
men
are
rugged
and
he
is
pushing
them
hard
he
should
arrive
there
at
least
a
day
before
the
gundermen
amalric
smote
the
table
with
his
clenched
fist
can
reach
tanasul
before
he
can
i
send
a
rider
to
tarascus
bidding
him
follow
me
to
tanasul
by
the
time
he
arrives
i
will
have
cut
conan
off
from
the
crossing
and
destroyed
him
then
our
combined
force
can
cross
the
river
and
deal
with
the
gundermen
xaltotun
shook
his
head
impatiently
good
enough
plan
if
you
were
dealing
with
anyone
but
conan
but
your
thousand
men
are
not
enough
to
destroy
his
eighteen
thousand
before
the
gundermen
come
up
they
will
fight
with
the
desperation
of
wounded
panthers
and
suppose
the
gundermen
come
up
while
the
hosts
are
locked
in
battle
you
will
be
caught
between
two
fires
and
destroyed
before
tarascus
can
arrive
he
will
reach
tanasul
too
late
to
aid
you
then
demanded
amalric
with
your
whole
strength
against
conan
answered
the
man
from
acheron
a
rider
bidding
tarascus
join
us
here
we
will
wait
his
coming
then
we
will
march
together
to
tanasul
while
we
wait
protested
amalric
will
cross
the
river
and
join
the
gundermen
will
not
cross
the
river
answered
xaltotun
amalric
head
jerked
up
and
he
stared
into
the
cryptic
dark
eyes
do
you
mean
there
were
torrential
rains
far
to
the
north
at
the
head
of
the
shirki
suppose
the
river
came
down
in
such
flood
as
to
render
the
crossing
at
tanasul
impassable
could
we
not
then
bring
up
our
entire
force
at
our
leisure
catch
conan
on
this
side
of
the
river
and
crush
him
and
then
when
the
flood
subsided
which
i
think
it
would
do
the
next
day
could
we
not
cross
the
river
and
destroy
the
gundermen
thus
we
could
use
our
full
strength
against
each
of
these
smaller
forces
in
turn
valerius
laughed
as
he
always
laughed
at
the
prospect
of
the
ruin
of
either
friend
or
foe
and
drew
a
restless
hand
jerkily
through
his
unruly
yellow
locks
amalric
stared
at
the
man
from
acheron
with
mingled
fear
and
admiration
we
caught
conan
in
shirki
valley
with
the
hill
ridges
to
his
right
and
the
river
in
flood
to
his
left
he
admitted
our
whole
force
we
could
annihilate
him
do
you
think
are
you
sure
do
you
believe
such
rains
will
fall
go
to
my
tent
answered
xaltotun
rising
is
not
accomplished
by
the
waving
of
a
wand
send
a
rider
to
tarascus
and
let
none
approach
my
tent
that
last
command
was
unnecessary
no
man
in
that
host
could
have
been
bribed
to
approach
that
mysterious
black
silken
pavilion
the
of
which
were
always
closely
drawn
none
but
xaltotun
ever
entered
it
yet
voices
were
often
heard
issuing
from
it
its
walls
billowed
sometimes
without
a
wind
and
weird
music
came
from
it
sometimes
deep
in
midnight
its
silken
walls
were
lit
red
by
flames
flickering
within
limning
misshapen
silhouettes
that
passed
to
and
fro
lying
in
his
own
tent
that
night
amalric
heard
the
steady
rumble
of
a
drum
in
xaltotun
tent
through
the
darkness
it
boomed
steadily
and
occasionally
the
nemedian
could
have
sworn
that
a
deep
croaking
voice
mingled
with
the
pulse
of
the
drum
and
he
shuddered
for
he
knew
that
voice
was
not
the
voice
of
xaltotun
the
drum
rustled
and
muttered
on
like
deep
thunder
heard
afar
off
and
before
dawn
amalric
glancing
from
his
tent
caught
the
red
flicker
of
lightning
afar
on
the
northern
horizon
in
all
other
parts
of
the
sky
the
great
stars
blazed
whitely
but
the
distant
lightning
flickered
incessantly
like
the
crimson
glint
of
firelight
on
a
tiny
turning
blade
at
sunset
of
the
next
day
tarascus
came
up
with
his
host
dusty
and
weary
from
hard
marching
the
footmen
straggling
hours
behind
the
horsemen
they
camped
in
the
plain
near
amalric
camp
and
at
dawn
the
combined
army
moved
westward
ahead
of
him
roved
a
swarm
of
scouts
and
amalric
waited
impatiently
for
them
to
return
and
tell
of
the
poitanians
trapped
beside
a
furious
flood
but
when
the
scouts
met
the
column
it
was
with
the
news
that
conan
had
crossed
the
river
exclaimed
amalric
he
cross
before
the
flood
was
no
flood
answered
the
scouts
puzzled
last
night
he
came
up
to
tanasul
and
flung
his
army
across
flood
exclaimed
xaltotun
taken
aback
for
the
first
time
in
amalric
knowledge
there
were
mighty
rains
upon
the
headwaters
of
the
shirki
last
night
and
the
night
before
that
may
be
your
lordship
answered
the
scout
is
true
the
water
was
muddy
and
the
people
of
tanasul
said
that
the
river
rose
perhaps
a
foot
yesterday
but
that
was
not
enough
to
prevent
conan
crossing
xaltotun
sorcery
had
failed
the
thought
hammered
in
amalric
brain
his
horror
of
this
strange
man
out
of
the
past
had
grown
steadily
since
that
night
in
belverus
when
he
had
seen
a
brown
shriveled
mummy
swell
and
grow
into
a
living
man
and
the
death
of
orastes
had
changed
lurking
horror
into
active
fear
in
his
heart
was
a
grisly
conviction
that
the
man
or
devil
was
invincible
yet
now
he
had
undeniable
proof
of
his
failure
yet
even
the
greatest
of
necromancers
might
fail
occasionally
thought
the
baron
at
any
rate
he
dared
not
oppose
the
man
from
acheron
yet
orastes
was
dead
writhing
in
mitra
only
knew
what
nameless
hell
and
amalric
knew
his
sword
would
scarcely
prevail
where
the
black
wisdom
of
the
renegade
priest
had
failed
what
grisly
abomination
xaltotun
plotted
lay
in
the
unpredictable
future
conan
and
his
host
were
a
present
menace
against
which
xaltotun
wizardry
might
well
be
needed
before
the
play
was
all
played
they
came
to
tanasul
a
small
fortified
village
at
the
spot
where
a
reef
of
rocks
made
a
natural
bridge
across
the
river
passable
always
except
in
times
of
greatest
flood
scouts
brought
in
the
news
that
conan
had
taken
up
his
position
in
the
goralian
hills
which
began
to
rise
a
few
miles
beyond
the
river
and
just
before
sundown
the
gundermen
had
arrived
in
his
camp
amalric
looked
at
xaltotun
inscrutable
and
alien
in
the
light
of
the
flaring
torches
night
had
fallen
now
your
magic
has
failed
conan
confronts
us
with
an
army
nearly
as
strong
as
our
own
and
he
has
the
advantage
of
position
we
have
a
choice
of
two
evils
to
camp
here
and
await
his
attack
or
to
fall
back
toward
tarantia
and
await
reinforcements
are
ruined
if
we
wait
answered
xaltotun
the
river
and
camp
on
the
plain
we
will
attack
at
dawn
his
position
is
too
strong
exclaimed
amalric
a
gust
of
passion
broke
the
veneer
of
the
wizard
calm
you
forgotten
valkia
because
some
obscure
elemental
principle
prevented
the
flood
do
you
deem
me
helpless
i
had
intended
that
your
spears
should
exterminate
our
enemies
but
do
not
fear
it
is
my
arts
that
shall
crush
their
host
conan
is
in
a
trap
he
will
never
see
another
sun
set
cross
the
river
they
crossed
by
the
flare
of
torches
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
clinked
on
the
rocky
bridge
splashed
through
the
shallows
the
glint
of
the
torches
on
shields
and
was
reflected
redly
in
the
black
water
the
rock
bridge
was
broad
on
which
they
crossed
but
even
so
it
was
past
midnight
before
the
host
was
camped
in
the
plain
beyond
above
them
they
could
see
fires
winking
redly
in
the
distance
conan
had
turned
at
bay
in
the
goralian
hills
which
had
more
than
once
before
served
as
the
last
stand
of
an
aquilonian
king
amalric
left
his
pavilion
and
strode
restlessly
through
the
camp
a
weird
glow
flickered
in
xaltotun
tent
and
from
time
to
time
a
demoniacal
cry
slashed
the
silence
and
there
was
a
low
sinister
muttering
of
a
drum
that
rustled
rather
than
rumbled
amalric
his
instincts
whetted
by
the
night
and
the
circumstances
felt
that
xaltotun
was
opposed
by
more
than
physical
force
doubts
of
the
wizard
power
assailed
him
he
glanced
at
the
fires
high
above
him
and
his
face
set
in
grim
lines
he
and
his
army
were
deep
in
the
midst
of
a
hostile
country
up
there
among
those
hills
lurked
thousands
of
wolfish
figures
out
of
whose
hearts
and
souls
all
emotion
and
hope
had
been
scourged
except
a
frenzied
hate
for
their
conquerors
a
mad
lust
for
vengeance
defeat
meant
annihilation
retreat
through
a
land
swarming
with
enemies
and
on
the
morrow
he
must
hurl
his
host
against
the
grimmest
fighter
in
the
western
nations
and
his
desperate
horde
if
xaltotun
failed
them
now
half
a
dozen
strode
out
of
the
shadows
the
firelight
glinted
on
their
and
helmet
crests
among
them
they
half
led
half
dragged
a
gaunt
figure
in
tattered
rags
saluting
they
spoke
lord
this
man
came
to
the
outposts
and
said
he
desired
word
with
king
valerius
he
is
an
aquilonian
he
looked
more
like
a
wolf
a
wolf
the
traps
had
scarred
old
sores
that
only
fetters
make
showed
on
his
wrists
and
ankles
a
great
brand
the
mark
of
hot
iron
disfigured
his
face
his
eyes
glared
through
the
tangle
of
his
matted
hair
as
he
half
crouched
before
the
baron
are
you
you
filthy
dog
demanded
the
nemedian
me
tiberias
answered
the
man
and
his
teeth
clicked
in
an
involuntary
spasm
have
come
to
tell
you
how
to
trap
conan
traitor
eh
rumbled
the
baron
say
you
have
gold
mouthed
the
man
shivering
under
his
rags
some
to
me
give
me
gold
and
i
will
show
you
how
to
defeat
the
king
his
eyes
glazed
widely
his
outstretched
upturned
hands
were
spread
like
quivering
claws
amalric
shrugged
his
shoulder
in
distaste
but
no
tool
was
too
base
for
his
use
you
speak
the
truth
you
shall
have
more
gold
than
you
can
carry
he
said
you
are
a
liar
and
a
spy
i
will
have
you
crucified
bring
him
along
in
the
tent
of
valerius
the
baron
pointed
to
the
man
who
crouched
shivering
before
them
huddling
his
rags
about
him
says
he
knows
a
way
to
aid
us
on
the
morrow
we
will
need
aid
if
xaltotun
plan
is
no
better
than
it
has
proved
so
far
speak
on
dog
the
man
body
writhed
in
strange
convulsions
words
came
in
a
stumbling
rush
camps
at
the
head
of
the
valley
of
lions
it
is
shaped
like
a
fan
with
steep
hills
on
either
side
if
you
attack
him
tomorrow
you
will
have
to
march
straight
up
the
valley
you
can
not
climb
the
hills
on
either
side
but
if
king
valerius
will
deign
to
accept
my
service
i
will
guide
him
through
the
hills
and
show
him
how
he
can
come
upon
king
conan
from
behind
but
if
it
is
to
be
done
at
all
we
must
start
soon
it
is
many
hours
riding
for
one
must
go
miles
to
the
west
then
miles
to
the
north
then
turn
eastward
and
so
come
into
the
valley
of
lions
from
behind
as
the
gundermen
came
amalric
hesitated
tugging
his
chin
in
these
chaotic
times
it
was
not
rare
to
find
men
willing
to
sell
their
souls
for
a
few
gold
pieces
you
lead
me
astray
you
will
die
said
valerius
are
aware
of
that
are
you
not
the
man
shivered
but
his
wide
eyes
did
not
waver
i
betray
you
slay
me
will
not
dare
divide
his
force
mused
amalric
will
need
all
his
men
to
repel
our
attack
he
can
not
spare
any
to
lay
ambushes
in
the
hills
besides
this
fellow
knows
his
hide
depends
on
his
leading
you
as
he
promised
would
a
dog
like
him
sacrifice
himself
nonsense
no
valerius
i
believe
the
man
is
honest
a
greater
thief
than
most
for
he
would
sell
his
liberator
laughed
valerius
well
i
will
follow
the
dog
how
many
men
can
you
spare
me
thousand
should
be
enough
answered
amalric
surprise
attack
on
their
rear
will
throw
them
into
confusion
and
that
will
be
enough
i
shall
expect
your
attack
about
noon
will
know
when
i
strike
answered
valerius
as
amalric
returned
to
his
pavilion
he
noted
with
gratification
that
xaltotun
was
still
in
his
tent
to
judge
from
the
cries
that
shuddered
forth
into
the
night
air
from
time
to
time
when
presently
he
heard
the
clink
of
steel
and
the
jingle
of
bridles
in
the
outer
darkness
he
smiled
grimly
valerius
had
about
served
his
purpose
the
baron
knew
that
conan
was
like
a
wounded
lion
that
rends
and
tears
even
in
his
when
valerius
struck
from
the
rear
the
desperate
strokes
of
the
cimmerian
might
well
wipe
his
rival
out
of
existence
before
he
himself
succumbed
so
much
the
better
amalric
felt
he
could
well
dispense
with
valerius
once
he
had
paved
the
way
for
a
nemedian
victory
the
five
thousand
horsemen
who
accompanied
valerius
were
aquilonian
renegades
for
the
most
part
in
the
still
starlight
they
moved
out
of
the
sleeping
camp
following
the
westward
trend
of
the
great
black
masses
that
rose
against
the
stars
ahead
of
them
valerius
rode
at
their
head
and
beside
him
rode
tiberias
a
leather
thong
about
his
wrist
gripped
by
a
who
rode
on
the
other
side
of
him
others
kept
close
behind
with
drawn
swords
us
false
and
you
die
instantly
valerius
pointed
out
do
not
know
every
in
these
hills
but
i
know
enough
about
the
general
configuration
of
the
country
to
know
the
directions
we
must
take
to
come
in
behind
the
valley
of
lions
see
that
you
do
not
lead
us
astray
the
man
ducked
his
head
and
his
teeth
chattered
as
he
volubly
assured
his
captor
of
his
loyalty
staring
up
stupidly
at
the
banner
that
floated
over
him
the
golden
serpent
of
the
old
dynasty
skirting
the
extremities
of
the
hills
that
locked
the
valley
of
lions
they
swung
wide
to
the
west
an
hour
ride
and
they
turned
north
forging
through
wild
and
rugged
hills
following
dim
trails
and
tortuous
paths
sunrise
found
them
some
miles
northwest
of
conan
position
and
here
the
guide
turned
eastward
and
led
them
through
a
maze
of
labyrinths
and
crags
valerius
nodded
judging
their
position
by
various
peaks
thrusting
up
above
the
others
he
had
kept
his
bearings
in
a
general
way
and
he
knew
they
were
still
headed
in
the
right
direction
but
now
without
warning
a
gray
fleecy
mass
came
billowing
down
from
the
north
veiling
the
slopes
spreading
out
through
the
valleys
it
blotted
out
the
sun
the
world
became
a
blind
gray
void
in
which
visibility
was
limited
to
a
matter
of
yards
advance
became
a
stumbling
groping
muddle
valerius
cursed
he
could
no
longer
see
the
peaks
that
had
served
him
as
he
must
depend
wholly
upon
the
traitorous
guide
the
golden
serpent
drooped
in
the
windless
air
presently
tiberias
seemed
himself
confused
he
halted
stared
about
uncertainly
you
lost
dog
demanded
valerius
harshly
somewhere
ahead
of
them
a
faint
vibration
began
the
rhythmic
rumble
of
a
drum
drum
exclaimed
the
aquilonian
we
are
close
enough
to
hear
the
drum
said
valerius
do
we
not
hear
the
shouts
and
the
clang
of
arms
surely
battle
has
joined
gorges
and
the
winds
play
strange
tricks
answered
tiberias
his
teeth
chattering
with
the
ague
that
is
frequently
the
lot
of
men
who
have
spent
much
time
in
damp
underground
dungeons
faintly
to
their
ears
came
a
low
muffled
roar
are
fighting
down
in
the
valley
cried
tiberias
drum
is
beating
on
the
heights
let
us
hasten
he
rode
straight
on
toward
the
sound
of
the
distant
drum
as
one
who
knows
his
ground
at
last
valerius
followed
cursing
the
fog
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
mask
his
advance
conan
could
not
see
him
coming
he
would
be
at
the
cimmerian
back
before
the
noonday
sun
dispelled
the
mists
just
now
he
could
not
tell
what
lay
on
either
hand
whether
cliffs
thickets
or
gorges
the
drum
throbbed
unceasingly
growing
louder
as
they
advanced
but
they
heard
no
more
of
the
battle
valerius
had
no
idea
toward
what
point
of
the
compass
they
were
headed
he
started
as
he
saw
gray
rock
walls
looming
through
the
smoky
drifts
on
either
hand
and
realized
that
they
were
riding
through
a
narrow
defile
but
the
guide
showed
no
sign
of
nervousness
and
valerius
hove
a
sigh
of
relief
when
the
walls
widened
out
and
became
invisible
in
the
fog
they
were
through
the
defile
if
an
ambush
had
been
planned
it
would
have
been
made
in
that
pass
but
now
tiberias
halted
again
the
drum
was
rumbling
louder
and
valerius
could
not
determine
from
what
direction
the
sound
was
coming
now
it
seemed
ahead
of
him
now
behind
now
on
one
hand
or
the
other
valerius
glared
about
him
impatiently
sitting
on
his
with
wisps
of
mist
curling
about
him
and
the
moisture
gleaming
on
his
armor
behind
him
the
long
lines
of
riders
faded
away
and
away
like
phantoms
into
the
mist
do
you
tarry
dog
he
demanded
the
man
seemed
to
be
listening
to
the
ghostly
drum
slowly
he
straightened
in
his
saddle
turned
his
head
and
faced
valerius
and
the
smile
on
his
lips
was
terrible
to
see
fog
is
thinning
valerius
he
said
in
a
new
voice
pointing
a
bony
finger
the
drum
was
silent
the
fog
was
fading
away
first
the
crests
of
cliffs
came
in
sight
above
the
gray
clouds
tall
and
spectral
lower
and
lower
crawled
the
mists
shrinking
fading
valerius
started
up
in
his
stirrups
with
a
cry
that
the
horsemen
echoed
behind
him
on
all
sides
of
them
the
cliffs
towered
they
were
not
in
a
wide
open
valley
as
he
had
supposed
they
were
in
a
blind
gorge
walled
by
sheer
cliffs
hundreds
of
feet
high
the
only
entrance
or
exit
was
that
narrow
defile
through
which
they
had
ridden
valerius
struck
tiberias
full
in
the
mouth
with
his
clenched
mailed
hand
devil
trick
is
this
tiberias
spat
out
a
mouthful
of
blood
and
shook
with
fearful
laughter
trick
that
shall
rid
the
world
of
a
beast
look
dog
again
valerius
cried
out
more
in
fury
than
in
fear
the
defile
was
blocked
by
a
wild
and
terrible
band
of
men
who
stood
silent
as
images
ragged
men
with
spears
in
their
hands
hundreds
of
them
and
up
on
the
cliffs
appeared
other
faces
thousands
of
faces
wild
gaunt
ferocious
faces
marked
by
fire
and
steel
and
starvation
trick
of
conan
raged
valerius
knows
nothing
of
it
laughed
tiberias
was
the
plot
of
broken
men
of
men
you
ruined
and
turned
to
beasts
amalric
was
right
conan
has
not
divided
his
army
we
are
the
rabble
who
followed
him
the
wolves
who
skulked
in
these
hills
the
homeless
men
the
hopeless
men
this
was
our
plan
and
the
priests
of
asura
aided
us
with
their
mist
look
at
them
valerius
each
bears
the
mark
of
your
hand
on
his
body
or
on
his
heart
at
me
you
do
not
know
me
do
you
what
of
this
scar
your
hangman
burned
upon
me
once
you
knew
me
once
i
was
lord
of
amilius
the
man
whose
sons
you
murdered
whose
daughter
your
mercenaries
ravished
and
slew
you
said
i
would
not
sacrifice
myself
to
trap
you
almighty
gods
if
i
had
a
thousand
lives
i
would
give
them
all
to
buy
your
doom
i
have
bought
it
look
on
the
men
you
broke
dead
men
who
once
played
the
king
their
hour
has
come
this
gorge
is
your
tomb
try
to
climb
the
cliffs
they
are
steep
they
are
high
try
to
fight
your
way
back
through
the
defile
spears
will
block
your
path
boulders
will
crush
you
from
above
dog
i
will
be
waiting
for
you
in
hell
throwing
back
his
head
he
laughed
until
the
rocks
rang
valerius
leaned
from
his
saddle
and
slashed
down
with
his
great
sword
severing
and
breast
tiberias
sank
to
the
earth
still
laughing
ghastily
through
a
gurgle
of
gushing
blood
the
drums
had
begun
again
encircling
the
gorge
with
guttural
thunder
boulders
came
crashing
down
above
the
screams
of
dying
men
shrilled
the
arrows
in
blinding
clouds
from
the
cliffs
the
road
to
acheron
dawn
was
just
whitening
the
east
when
amalric
drew
up
his
hosts
in
the
mouth
of
the
valley
of
lions
this
valley
was
flanked
by
low
rolling
but
steep
hills
and
the
floor
pitched
upward
in
a
series
of
irregular
natural
terraces
on
the
uppermost
of
these
terraces
conan
army
held
its
position
awaiting
the
attack
the
host
that
had
joined
him
marching
down
from
gunderland
had
not
been
composed
exclusively
of
spearmen
with
them
had
come
seven
thousand
bossonian
archers
and
four
thousand
barons
and
their
retainers
of
the
north
and
west
swelling
the
ranks
of
his
cavalry
the
pikemen
were
drawn
up
in
a
compact
formation
at
the
narrow
head
of
the
valley
there
were
nineteen
thousand
of
them
mostly
gundermen
though
some
four
thousand
were
aquilonians
of
other
provinces
they
were
flanked
on
either
hand
by
five
thousand
bossonian
archers
behind
the
ranks
of
the
pikemen
the
knights
sat
their
steeds
motionless
lances
raised
ten
thousand
knights
of
poitain
nine
thousand
aquilonians
barons
and
their
retainers
it
was
a
strong
position
his
flanks
could
not
be
turned
for
that
would
mean
climbing
the
steep
wooded
hills
in
the
teeth
of
the
arrows
and
swords
of
the
bossonians
his
camp
lay
directly
behind
him
in
a
narrow
valley
which
was
indeed
merely
a
continuation
of
the
valley
of
lions
pitching
up
at
a
higher
level
he
did
not
fear
a
surprise
from
the
rear
because
the
hills
behind
him
were
full
of
refugees
and
broken
men
whose
loyalty
to
him
was
beyond
question
but
if
his
position
was
hard
to
shake
it
was
equally
hard
to
escape
from
it
was
a
trap
as
well
as
a
fortress
for
the
defenders
a
desperate
last
stand
of
men
who
did
not
expect
to
survive
unless
they
were
victorious
the
only
line
of
retreat
possible
was
through
the
narrow
valley
at
their
rear
xaltotun
mounted
a
hill
on
the
left
side
of
the
valley
near
the
wide
mouth
this
hill
rose
higher
than
the
others
and
was
known
as
the
king
altar
for
a
reason
long
forgotten
only
xaltotun
knew
and
his
memory
dated
back
three
thousand
years
he
was
not
alone
his
two
familiars
silent
hairy
furtive
and
dark
were
with
him
and
they
bore
a
young
aquilonian
girl
bound
hand
and
foot
they
laid
her
on
an
ancient
stone
which
was
curiously
like
an
altar
and
which
crowned
the
summit
of
the
hill
for
long
centuries
it
had
stood
there
worn
by
the
elements
until
many
doubted
that
it
was
anything
but
a
curiously
shapen
natural
rock
but
what
it
was
and
why
it
stood
there
xaltotun
remembered
from
of
old
the
familiars
went
away
with
their
bent
backs
like
silent
gnomes
and
xaltotun
stood
alone
beside
the
altar
his
dark
beard
blown
in
the
wind
overlooking
the
valley
he
could
see
clear
back
to
the
winding
shirki
and
up
into
the
hills
beyond
the
head
of
the
valley
he
could
see
the
gleaming
wedge
of
steel
drawn
up
at
the
head
of
the
terraces
the
burganets
of
the
archers
glinting
among
the
rocks
and
bushes
the
silent
knights
motionless
on
their
steeds
their
pennons
flowing
above
their
helmets
their
lances
rising
in
a
bristling
thicket
looking
in
the
other
direction
he
could
see
the
long
serried
lines
of
the
nemedians
moving
in
ranks
of
shining
steel
into
the
mouth
of
the
valley
behind
them
the
gay
pavilions
of
the
lords
and
knights
and
the
drab
tents
of
the
common
soldiers
stretched
back
almost
to
the
river
like
a
river
of
molten
steel
the
nemedian
host
flowed
into
the
valley
the
great
scarlet
dragon
rippling
over
it
first
marched
the
bowmen
in
even
ranks
arbalests
half
raised
bolts
nocked
fingers
on
triggers
after
them
came
the
pikemen
and
behind
them
the
real
strength
of
the
army
the
mounted
knights
their
banners
unfurled
to
the
wind
their
lances
lifted
walking
their
great
steeds
forward
as
if
they
rode
to
a
banquet
and
higher
up
on
the
slopes
the
smaller
aquilonian
host
stood
grimly
silent
there
were
thirty
thousand
nemedian
knights
and
as
in
most
hyborian
nations
it
was
the
chivalry
which
was
the
sword
of
the
army
the
footmen
were
used
only
to
clear
the
way
for
a
charge
of
the
armored
knights
there
were
thousand
of
these
pikemen
and
archers
the
bowmen
began
loosing
as
they
advanced
without
breaking
ranks
launching
their
quarrels
with
a
whir
and
tang
but
the
bolts
fell
short
or
rattled
harmlessly
from
the
overlapping
shields
of
the
gundermen
and
before
the
arbalesters
could
come
within
killing
range
the
arching
shafts
of
the
bossonians
were
wreaking
havoc
in
their
ranks
a
little
of
this
a
futile
attempt
at
exchanging
fire
and
the
nemedian
bowmen
began
falling
back
in
disorder
their
armor
was
light
their
weapons
no
match
for
the
bossonian
longbows
the
western
archers
were
sheltered
by
bushes
and
rocks
moreover
the
nemedian
footmen
lacked
something
of
the
morale
of
the
horsemen
knowing
as
they
did
that
they
were
being
used
merely
to
clear
the
way
for
the
knights
the
fell
back
and
between
their
opening
lines
the
pikemen
advanced
these
were
largely
mercenaries
and
their
masters
had
no
compunction
about
sacrificing
them
they
were
intended
to
mask
the
advance
of
the
knights
until
the
latter
were
within
smiting
distance
so
while
the
arbalesters
plied
their
bolts
from
either
flank
at
long
range
the
pikemen
marched
into
the
teeth
of
the
blast
from
above
and
behind
them
the
knights
came
on
when
the
pikemen
began
to
falter
beneath
the
savage
hail
of
death
that
whistled
down
the
slopes
among
them
a
trumpet
blew
their
companies
divided
to
right
and
left
and
through
them
the
mailed
knights
thundered
they
ran
full
into
a
cloud
of
stinging
death
the
clothyard
shafts
found
every
crevice
in
their
armor
and
the
housings
of
the
steeds
horses
scrambling
up
the
grassy
terraces
reared
and
plunged
backward
bearing
their
riders
with
them
forms
littered
the
slopes
the
charge
wavered
and
ebbed
back
back
down
in
the
valley
amalric
reformed
his
ranks
tarascus
was
fighting
with
drawn
sword
under
the
scarlet
dragon
but
it
was
the
baron
of
tor
who
commanded
that
day
amalric
swore
as
he
glanced
at
the
forest
of
visible
above
and
beyond
the
of
the
gundermen
he
had
hoped
his
retirement
would
draw
the
knights
out
in
a
charge
down
the
slopes
after
him
to
be
raked
from
either
flank
by
his
bowmen
and
swamped
by
the
numbers
of
his
horsemen
but
they
had
not
moved
brought
skins
of
water
from
the
river
knights
doffed
their
helmets
and
drenched
their
sweating
heads
the
wounded
on
the
slopes
screamed
vainly
for
water
in
the
upper
valley
springs
supplied
the
defenders
they
did
not
thirst
that
long
hot
spring
day
on
the
king
altar
beside
the
ancient
carven
stone
xaltotun
watched
the
steel
tide
ebb
and
flow
on
came
the
knights
with
waving
plumes
and
dipping
lances
through
a
whistling
cloud
of
arrows
they
plowed
to
break
like
a
thundering
wave
on
the
bristling
wall
of
spears
and
shields
axes
rose
and
fell
above
the
plumed
helmets
spears
thrust
upward
bringing
down
horses
and
riders
the
pride
of
the
gundermen
was
no
less
fierce
than
that
of
the
knights
they
were
not
to
be
sacrificed
for
the
glory
of
better
men
they
were
the
finest
infantry
in
the
world
with
a
tradition
that
made
their
morale
unshakable
the
kings
of
aquilonia
had
long
learned
the
worth
of
unbreakable
infantry
they
held
their
formation
unshaken
over
their
gleaming
ranks
flowed
the
great
lion
banner
and
at
the
tip
of
the
wedge
a
giant
figure
in
black
armor
roared
and
smote
like
a
hurricane
with
a
dripping
ax
that
split
steel
and
bone
alike
the
nemedians
fought
as
gallantly
as
their
traditions
of
high
courage
demanded
but
they
could
not
break
the
iron
wedge
and
from
the
wooded
knolls
on
either
hand
arrows
raked
their
ranks
mercilessly
their
own
bowmen
were
useless
their
pikemen
unable
to
climb
the
heights
and
come
to
grips
with
the
bossonians
slowly
stubbornly
sullenly
the
grim
knights
fell
back
counting
their
empty
saddles
above
them
the
gundermen
made
no
outcry
of
triumph
they
closed
their
ranks
locking
up
the
gaps
made
by
the
fallen
sweat
ran
into
their
eyes
from
under
their
steel
caps
they
gripped
their
spears
and
waited
their
fierce
hearts
swelling
with
pride
that
a
king
should
fight
on
foot
with
them
behind
them
the
aquilonian
knights
had
not
moved
they
sat
their
steeds
grimly
immobile
a
knight
spurred
a
sweating
horse
up
the
hill
called
the
king
altar
and
glared
at
xaltotun
with
bitter
eyes
bids
me
say
that
it
is
time
to
use
your
magic
wizard
he
said
are
dying
like
flies
down
there
in
the
valley
we
can
not
break
their
ranks
xaltotun
seemed
to
expand
to
grow
tall
and
awesome
and
terrible
to
amalric
he
said
him
to
his
ranks
for
a
charge
but
to
await
my
signal
before
that
signal
is
given
he
will
see
a
sight
that
he
will
remember
until
he
lies
dying
the
knight
saluted
as
if
compelled
against
his
will
and
thundered
down
the
hill
at
breakneck
pace
xaltotun
stood
beside
the
dark
and
stared
across
the
valley
at
the
dead
and
wounded
men
on
the
terraces
at
the
grim
band
at
the
head
of
the
slopes
at
the
dusty
ranks
reforming
in
the
vale
below
he
glanced
up
at
the
sky
and
he
glanced
down
at
the
slim
white
figure
on
the
dark
stone
and
lifting
a
dagger
inlaid
with
archaic
hieroglyphs
he
intoned
an
immemorial
invocation
god
of
darkness
scaly
lord
of
the
shadows
by
the
blood
of
a
virgin
and
the
sevenfold
symbol
i
call
to
your
sons
below
the
black
earth
children
of
the
deeps
below
the
red
earth
under
the
black
earth
awaken
and
shake
your
awful
manes
let
the
hills
rock
and
the
stones
topple
upon
my
enemies
let
the
sky
grow
dark
above
them
the
earth
unstable
beneath
their
feet
let
a
wind
from
the
deep
black
earth
curl
up
beneath
their
feet
and
blacken
and
shrivel
them
he
halted
short
dagger
lifted
in
the
tense
silence
the
roar
of
the
hosts
rose
beneath
him
borne
on
the
wind
on
the
other
side
of
the
altar
stood
a
man
in
a
black
hooded
robe
whose
coif
shadowed
pale
delicate
features
and
dark
eyes
calm
and
meditative
of
asura
whispered
xaltotun
his
voice
was
like
the
hiss
of
an
angered
serpent
you
mad
that
you
seek
your
doom
ho
baal
chiron
again
dog
of
acheron
said
the
other
and
laughed
them
loudly
they
will
not
hear
unless
your
shouts
reverberate
in
hell
from
a
thicket
on
the
edge
of
the
crest
came
a
somber
old
woman
in
peasant
garb
her
hair
flowing
over
her
shoulders
a
great
gray
wolf
following
at
her
heels
priest
and
wolf
muttered
xaltotun
grimly
and
laughed
to
pit
your
charlatan
mummery
against
my
arts
with
a
wave
of
my
hand
i
brush
you
from
my
path
arts
are
straws
in

dog
of

answered
the
asurian
you
wondered
why
the
shirki
did
not
come
down
in
flood
and
trap
conan
on
the
other
bank
when
i
saw
the
lightning
in
the
night
i
guessed
your
plan
and
my
spells
dispersed
the
clouds
you
had
summoned
before
they
could
empty
their
torrents
you
did
not
even
know
that
your
wizardry
had
failed
lie
cried
xaltotun
but
the
confidence
in
his
voice
was
shaken
have
felt
the
impact
of
a
powerful
sorcery
against
mine
but
no
man
on
earth
could
undo
the
once
made
unless
he
possessed
the
very
heart
of

the
flood
you
plotted

answered
the

at
your
allies
in

pythonian
you
have
led
them
to
the
slaughter
they
are
caught
in
the
fangs
of

and
you

them
look
he
pointed
out
of
the
narrow
gorge
of
the
upper
valley
behind
the
poitanians
a
horseman
came
flying
whirling
something
about
his
head
that
flashed
in
the
sun
recklessly
he
hurtled
down
the
slopes
through
the
ranks
of
the
gundermen
who
sent
up
a
roar
and
clashed
their
spears
and
shields
like
thunder
in
the
hills
on
the
terraces
between
the
hosts
the
horse
reared
and
plunged
and
his
wild
rider
yelled
and
brandished
the
thing
in
his
hands
like
one
demented
it
was
the
torn
remnant
of
a
scarlet
banner
and
the
sun
struck
dazzlingly
on
the
golden
scales
of
a
serpent
that
writhed

cried
hadrathus
ringingly
fog
and
a
drum
lured
him
to
his
doom
i
gathered
that
fog
dog
of
python
and
i
dispersed
it
i
with
my
magic
which
is
greater
than
your
magic
matters
it
roared
xaltotun
a
terrible
sight
his
eyes
blazing
his
features
convulsed
was
a
fool
i
do
not
need
him
i
can
crush
conan
without
human
aid
have
you
delayed
mocked
hadrathus
have
you
allowed
so
many
of
your
allies
to
fall
pierced
by
arrows
and
spitted
on
spears
blood
aids
great
sorcery
thundered
xaltotun
in
a
voice
that
made
the
rocks
quiver
a
lurid
nimbus
played
about
his
awful
head
no
wizard
wastes
his
strength
thoughtlessly
because
i
would
conserve
my
powers
for
the
great
days
to
be
rather
than
employ
them
in
a
brawl
but
now
by
set
i
shall
loose
them
to
the
uttermost
watch
dog
of
asura
false
priest
of
an
outworn
god
and
see
a
sight
that
shall
blast
your
reason
for
evermore
hadrathus
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
and
hell
was
in
his
laughter
black
devil
of
python
his
hand
came
from
under
his
robe
holding
something
that
flamed
and
burned
in
the
sun
changing
the
light
to
a
pulsing
golden
glow
in
which
the
flesh
of
xaltotun
looked
like
the
flesh
of
a
corpse
xaltotun
cried
out
as
if
he
had
been
stabbed
heart
the
heart
of
ahriman
the
one
power
that
is
greater
than
your
power
xaltotun
seemed
to
shrivel
to
grow
old
suddenly
his
beard
was
shot
with
snow
his
locks
flecked
with
gray
heart
he
mumbled
stole
it
dog
thief
i
it
has
been
on
a
long
journey
far
to
the
southward
but
now
it
is
in
my
hands
and
your
black
arts
can
not
stand
against
it
as
it
resurrected
you
so
shall
it
hurl
you
back
into
the
night
whence
it
drew
you
you
shall
go
down
the
dark
road
to
acheron
which
is
the
road
of
silence
and
the
night
the
dark
empire
unreborn
shall
remain
a
legend
and
a
black
memory
conan
shall
reign
again
and
the
heart
of
ahriman
shall
go
back
into
the
cavern
below
the
temple
of
mitra
to
burn
as
a
symbol
of
the
power
of
aquilonia
for
a
thousand
years
xaltotun
screamed
inhumanly
and
rushed
around
the
altar
dagger
lifted
but
from
somewhere
out
of
the
sky
perhaps
or
the
great
jewel
that
blazed
in
the
hand
of
hadrathus
shot
a
jetting
beam
of
blinding
blue
light
full
against
the
breast
of
xaltotun
it
flashed
and
the
hills
the
concussion
the
wizard
of
acheron
went
down
as
though
struck
by
a
thunderbolt
and
before
he
touched
the
ground
he
was
fearfully
altered
beside
the
lay
no
corpse
but
a
shriveled
mummy
a
brown
dry
unrecognizable
carcass
sprawling
among
moldering
swathings
somberly
old
zelata
looked
down
was
not
a
living
man
she
said
heart
lent
him
a
false
aspect
of
life
that
deceived
even
himself
i
never
saw
him
as
other
than
a
mummy
hadrathus
bent
to
unbind
the
swooning
girl
on
the
altar
when
from
among
the
trees
appeared
a
strange
apparition
xaltotun
chariot
drawn
by
the
weird
horses
silently
they
advanced
to
the
altar
and
halted
with
the
chariot
wheel
almost
touching
the
brown
withered
thing
on
the
grass
hadrathus
lifted
the
body
of
the
wizard
and
placed
it
in
the
chariot
and
without
hesitation
the
uncanny
steeds
turned
and
moved
off
southward
down
the
hill
and
hadrathus
and
zelata
and
the
gray
wolf
watched
them
go
down
the
long
road
to
acheron
which
is
beyond
the
ken
of
men
down
in
the
valley
amalric
had
stiffened
in
his
saddle
when
he
saw
that
wild
horseman
curvetting
and
caracoling
on
the
slopes
while
he
brandished
that
then
some
instinct
jerked
his
head
about
toward
the
hill
known
as
the
king
altar
and
his
lips
parted
every
man
in
the
valley
saw
it
an
arching
shaft
of
dazzling
light
that
towered
up
from
the
summit
of
the
hill
showering
golden
fire
high
above
the
hosts
it
burst
in
a
blinding
blaze
that
momentarily
paled
the
sun
not
xaltotun
signal
roared
the
baron
shouted
tarascus
a
signal
to
the
aquilonians
look
above
them
the
immobile
ranks
were
moving
at
last
and
a
roar
thundered
across
the
vale
has
failed
us
bellowed
amalric
furiously
has
failed
us
we
have
been
led
into
a
trap
mitra
curse
on
xaltotun
who
led
us
here
sound
the
retreat
late
yelled
tarascus
up
on
the
slopes
the
forest
of
lances
dipped
leveled
the
ranks
of
the
gundermen
rolled
back
to
right
and
left
like
a
parting
curtain
and
with
a
thunder
like
the
rising
roar
of
a
hurricane
the
knights
of
aquilonia
crashed
down
the
slopes
the
impetus
of
that
charge
was
irresistible
bolts
driven
by
the
demoralized
arbalesters
glanced
from
their
shields
their
bent
helmets
their
plumes
and
pennons
streaming
out
behind
them
their
lances
lowered
they
swept
over
the
wavering
lines
of
pikemen
and
roared
down
the
slopes
like
a
wave
amalric
yelled
an
order
to
charge
and
the
nemedians
with
desperate
courage
spurred
their
horses
at
the
slopes
they
still
outnumbered
the
attackers
but
they
were
weary
men
on
tired
horses
charging
uphill
the
onrushing
knights
had
not
struck
a
blow
that
day
their
horses
were
fresh
they
were
coming
downhill
and
they
came
like
a
thunderbolt
and
like
a
thunderbolt
they
smote
the
struggling
ranks
of
the
nemedians
smote
them
split
them
apart
ripped
them
asunder
and
dashed
the
remnants
headlong
down
the
slopes
after
them
on
foot
came
the
gundermen
and
the
bossonians
were
swarming
down
the
hills
loosing
as
they
ran
at
every
foe
that
still
moved
down
the
slopes
washed
the
tide
of
battle
the
dazed
nemedians
swept
on
the
crest
of
the
wave
their
archers
had
thrown
down
their
arbalests
and
were
fleeing
such
pikemen
as
had
survived
the
blasting
charge
of
the
knights
were
cut
to
pieces
by
the
ruthless
gundermen
in
a
wild
confusion
the
battle
swept
through
the
wide
mouth
of
the
valley
and
into
the
plain
beyond
all
over
the
plain
swarmed
the
warriors
fleeing
and
pursuing
broken
into
single
combat
and
clumps
of
smiting
hacking
knights
on
rearing
wheeling
horses
but
the
nemedians
were
smashed
broken
unable
to
or
make
a
stand
by
the
hundreds
they
broke
away
spurring
for
the
river
many
reached
it
rushed
across
and
rode
eastward
the
countryside
was
up
behind
them
the
people
hunted
them
like
wolves
few
ever
reached
tarantia
the
final
break
did
not
come
until
the
fall
of
amalric
the
baron
striving
in
vain
to
rally
his
men
rode
straight
at
the
clump
of
knights
that
followed
the
giant
in
black
armor
whose
surcoat
bore
the
royal
lion
and
over
whose
head
floated
the
golden
lion
banner
with
the
scarlet
leopard
of
poitain
beside
it
a
tall
warrior
in
gleaming
armor
couched
his
lance
and
charged
to
meet
the
lord
of
tor
they
met
like
a
thunderclap
the
nemedian
lance
striking
his
foe
helmet
snapped
bolts
and
rivets
and
tore
off
the
casque
revealing
the
features
of
pallantides
but
the
aquilonian
crashed
through
shield
and
to
transfix
the
baron
heart
a
roar
went
up
as
amalric
was
hurled
from
his
saddle
snapping
the
lance
that
impaled
him
and
the
nemedians
gave
way
as
a
barrier
bursts
under
the
surging
impact
of
a
tidal
wave
they
rode
for
the
river
in
a
blind
stampede
that
swept
the
plain
like
a
whirlwind
the
hour
of
the
dragon
had
passed
tarascus
did
not
flee
amalric
was
dead
the
slain
and
the
royal
nemedian
banner
trampled
in
the
blood
and
dust
most
of
his
knights
were
fleeing
and
the
aquilonians
were
riding
them
down
tarascus
knew
the
day
was
lost
but
with
a
handful
of
faithful
followers
he
raged
through
the
mêlée
conscious
of
but
one
desire
to
meet
conan
the
cimmerian
and
at
last
he
met
him
formations
had
been
destroyed
utterly
bands
broken
asunder
and
swept
apart
the
crest
of
trocero
gleamed
in
one
part
of
the
plain
those
of
prospero
and
pallantides
in
others
conan
was
alone
the
of
tarascus
had
fallen
one
by
one
the
two
kings
met
man
to
man
even
as
they
rode
at
each
other
the
horse
of
tarascus
sobbed
and
sank
under
him
conan
leaped
from
his
own
steed
and
ran
at
him
as
the
king
of
nemedia
disengaged
himself
and
rose
steel
flashed
blindingly
in
the
sun
clashed
loudly
and
blue
sparks
flew
then
a
clang
of
armor
as
tarascus
measured
his
full
length
on
the
earth
beneath
a
thunderous
stroke
of
conan
broadsword
the
cimmerian
placed
a
foot
on
his
enemy
breast
and
lifted
his
sword
his
helmet
was
gone
he
shook
back
his
black
mane
and
his
blue
eyes
blazed
with
their
old
fire
you
yield
you
give
me
quarter
demanded
the
nemedian
better
than
you
have
given
me
you
dog
life
for
you
and
all
your
men
who
throw
down
their
arms
though
i
ought
to
split
your
head
for
an
infernal
thief
the
cimmerian
added
tarascus
twisted
his
neck
and
glared
over
the
plain
the
remnants
of
the
nemedian
host
were
flying
across
the
stone
bridge
with
swarms
of
victorious
aquilonians
at
their
heels
smiting
with
fury
of
glutted
vengeance
bossonians
and
gundermen
were
swarming
through
the
camp
of
their
enemies
tearing
the
tents
to
pieces
in
search
of
plunder
seizing
prisoners
ripping
open
the
baggage
and
upsetting
the
wagons
tarascus
cursed
fervently
and
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
well
as
he
could
under
the
circumstances
well
i
have
no
choice
what
are
your
demands
to
me
all
your
present
holdings
in
aquilonia
order
your
garrisons
to
march
out
of
the
castles
and
towns
they
hold
without
their
arms
and
get
your
infernal
armies
out
of
aquilonia
as
quickly
as
possible
in
addition
you
shall
return
all
aquilonians
sold
as
slaves
and
pay
an
indemnity
to
be
designated
later
when
the
damage
your
occupation
of
the
country
has
caused
has
been
properly
estimated
you
will
remain
as
hostage
until
these
terms
have
been
carried
out
well
surrendered
tarascus
will
surrender
all
the
castles
and
towns
now
held
by
my
garrisons
without
resistance
and
all
the
other
things
shall
be
done
what
ransom
for
my
body
conan
laughed
and
removed
his
foot
from
his
foe
breast
grasped
his
shoulder
and
heaved
him
to
his
feet
he
started
to
speak
then
turned
to
see
hadrathus
approaching
him
the
priest
was
as
calm
and
as
ever
picking
his
way
between
rows
of
dead
men
and
horses
conan
wiped
the
dust
from
his
face
with
a
hand
he
had
fought
all
through
the
day
first
on
foot
with
the
pikemen
then
in
the
saddle
leading
the
charge
his
surcoat
was
gone
his
armor
splashed
with
blood
and
battered
with
strokes
of
sword
mace
and
ax
he
loomed
gigantically
against
a
background
of
blood
and
slaughter
like
some
grim
pagan
hero
of
mythology
done
hadrathus
quoth
he
gustily
crom
i
am
glad
to
see
your
signal
my
knights
were
almost
mad
with
impatience
and
eating
their
hearts
out
to
be
at
i
could
not
have
held
them
much
longer
what
of
the
wizard
has
gone
down
the
dim
road
to
acheron
answered
hadrathus
i
i
am
for
tarantia
my
work
is
done
here
and
i
have
a
task
to
perform
at
the
temple
of
mitra
all
our
work
is
done
here
on
this
field
we
have
saved
aquilonia
and
more
than
aquilonia
your
ride
to
your
capital
will
be
a
triumphal
procession
through
a
kingdom
mad
with
joy
all
aquilonia
will
be
cheering
the
return
of
their
king
and
so
until
we
meet
again
in
the
great
royal
hall
farewell
conan
stood
silently
watching
the
priest
as
he
went
from
various
parts
of
the
field
knights
were
hurrying
toward
him
he
saw
pallantides
trocero
prospero
servius
galannus
their
armor
splashed
with
crimson
the
thunder
of
battle
was
giving
way
to
a
roar
of
triumph
and
acclaim
all
eyes
hot
with
strife
and
shining
with
exultation
were
turned
toward
the
great
black
figure
of
the
king
mailed
arms
brandished
swords
a
confused
torrent
of
sound
rose
deep
and
thunderous
as
the
conan
king
of
aquilonia
tarascus
spoke
have
not
yet
named
my
ransom
conan
laughed
and
slapped
his
sword
home
in
its
scabbard
he
flexed
his
mighty
arms
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
thick
black
locks
as
if
feeling
there
his
crown
is
a
girl
in
your
seraglio
named
zenobia
yes
so
there
is
well
the
king
smiled
as
at
an
exceedingly
pleasant
memory
shall
be
your
ransom
and
naught
else
i
will
come
to
belverus
for
her
as
i
promised
she
was
a
slave
in
nemedia
but
i
will
make
her
queen
of
aquilonia
