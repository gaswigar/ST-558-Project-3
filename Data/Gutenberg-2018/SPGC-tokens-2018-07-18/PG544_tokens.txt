gables
thanks
be
i
done
with
geometry
learning
or
teaching
it
said
anne
shirley
a
trifle
vindictively
as
she
thumped
a
somewhat
battered
volume
of
euclid
into
a
big
chest
of
books
banged
the
lid
in
triumph
and
sat
down
upon
it
looking
at
diana
wright
across
the
green
gables
garret
with
gray
eyes
that
were
like
a
morning
sky
the
garret
was
a
shadowy
suggestive
delightful
place
as
all
garrets
should
be
through
the
open
window
by
which
anne
sat
blew
the
sweet
scented
air
of
the
august
afternoon
outside
poplar
boughs
rustled
and
tossed
in
the
wind
beyond
them
were
the
woods
where
lover
lane
wound
its
enchanted
path
and
the
old
apple
orchard
which
still
bore
its
rosy
harvests
munificently
and
over
all
was
a
great
mountain
range
of
snowy
clouds
in
the
blue
southern
sky
through
the
other
window
was
glimpsed
a
distant
blue
sea
the
beautiful
lawrence
gulf
on
which
floats
like
a
jewel
abegweit
whose
softer
sweeter
indian
name
has
long
been
forsaken
for
the
more
prosaic
one
of
prince
edward
island
diana
wright
three
years
older
than
when
we
last
saw
her
had
grown
somewhat
matronly
in
the
intervening
time
but
her
eyes
were
as
black
and
brilliant
her
cheeks
as
rosy
and
her
dimples
as
enchanting
as
in
the
days
when
she
and
anne
shirley
had
vowed
eternal
friendship
in
the
garden
at
orchard
slope
in
her
arms
she
held
a
small
sleeping
creature
who
for
two
happy
years
had
been
known
to
the
world
of
avonlea
as
small
anne
cordelia
avonlea
folks
knew
why
diana
had
called
her
anne
of
course
but
avonlea
folks
were
puzzled
by
the
cordelia
there
had
never
been
a
cordelia
in
the
wright
or
barry
connections
harmon
andrews
said
she
supposed
diana
had
found
the
name
in
some
trashy
novel
and
wondered
that
fred
had
more
sense
than
to
allow
it
but
diana
and
anne
smiled
at
each
other
they
knew
how
small
anne
cordelia
had
come
by
her
name
you
always
hated
geometry
said
diana
with
a
retrospective
smile
i
should
think
you
be
real
glad
to
be
through
with
teaching
anyhow
oh
i
always
liked
teaching
apart
from
geometry
these
past
three
years
in
summerside
have
been
very
pleasant
ones
harmon
andrews
told
me
when
i
came
home
that
i
would
likely
find
married
life
as
much
better
than
teaching
as
i
expected
evidently
harmon
is
of
hamlet
opinion
that
it
may
be
better
to
bear
the
ills
that
we
have
than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
anne
laugh
as
blithe
and
irresistible
as
of
yore
with
an
added
note
of
sweetness
and
maturity
rang
through
the
garret
marilla
in
the
kitchen
below
compounding
blue
plum
preserve
heard
it
and
smiled
then
sighed
to
think
how
seldom
that
dear
laugh
would
echo
through
green
gables
in
the
years
to
come
nothing
in
her
life
had
ever
given
marilla
so
much
happiness
as
the
knowledge
that
anne
was
going
to
marry
gilbert
blythe
but
every
joy
must
bring
with
it
its
little
shadow
of
sorrow
during
the
three
summerside
years
anne
had
been
home
often
for
vacations
and
weekends
but
after
this
a
visit
would
be
as
much
as
could
be
hoped
for
you
need
let
what
harmon
says
worry
you
said
diana
with
the
calm
assurance
of
the
matron
married
life
has
its
ups
and
downs
of
course
you
must
expect
that
everything
will
always
go
smoothly
but
i
can
assure
you
anne
that
it
a
happy
life
when
you
married
to
the
right
man
anne
smothered
a
smile
diana
airs
of
vast
experience
always
amused
her
a
little
i
daresay
i
be
putting
them
on
too
when
i
been
married
four
years
she
thought
surely
my
sense
of
humor
will
preserve
me
from
it
though
is
it
settled
yet
where
you
are
going
to
live
asked
diana
cuddling
small
anne
cordelia
with
the
inimitable
gesture
of
motherhood
which
always
sent
through
anne
heart
filled
with
sweet
unuttered
dreams
and
hopes
a
thrill
that
was
half
pure
pleasure
and
half
a
strange
ethereal
pain
yes
that
was
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
when
i
to
you
to
come
down
today
by
the
way
i
ca
realize
that
we
really
have
telephones
in
avonlea
now
it
sounds
so
preposterously
and
modernish
for
this
darling
leisurely
old
place
we
can
thank
the
for
them
said
diana
we
should
never
have
got
the
line
if
they
had
taken
the
matter
up
and
carried
it
through
there
was
enough
cold
water
thrown
to
discourage
any
society
but
they
stuck
to
it
nevertheless
you
did
a
splendid
thing
for
avonlea
when
you
founded
that
society
anne
what
fun
we
did
have
at
our
meetings
will
you
ever
forget
the
blue
hall
and
judson
scheme
for
painting
medicine
advertisements
on
his
fence
i
do
know
that
i
wholly
grateful
to
the
in
the
matter
of
the
telephone
said
anne
oh
i
know
it
most
convenient
even
more
so
than
our
old
device
of
signalling
to
each
other
by
flashes
of
candlelight
and
as
rachel
says
must
keep
up
with
the
procession
that
what
but
somehow
i
feel
as
if
i
did
want
avonlea
spoiled
by
what
harrison
when
he
wants
to
be
witty
calls
inconveniences
i
should
like
to
have
it
kept
always
just
as
it
was
in
the
dear
old
years
that
foolish
and
sentimental
and
impossible
so
i
shall
immediately
become
wise
and
practical
and
possible
the
telephone
as
harrison
concedes
is
buster
of
a
good
thing
even
if
you
do
know
that
probably
half
a
dozen
interested
people
are
listening
along
the
line
that
the
worst
of
it
sighed
diana
it
so
annoying
to
hear
the
receivers
going
down
whenever
you
ring
anyone
up
they
say
harmon
andrews
insisted
that
their
should
be
put
in
their
kitchen
just
so
that
she
could
listen
whenever
it
rang
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
dinner
at
the
same
time
today
when
you
called
me
i
distinctly
heard
that
queer
clock
of
the
pyes
striking
so
no
doubt
josie
or
gertie
was
listening
oh
so
that
is
why
you
said
got
a
new
clock
at
green
gables
have
you
i
could
imagine
what
you
meant
i
heard
a
vicious
click
as
soon
as
you
had
spoken
i
suppose
it
was
the
pye
receiver
being
hung
up
with
profane
energy
well
never
mind
the
pyes
as
rachel
says
they
always
were
and
pyes
they
always
will
be
world
without
end
amen
i
want
to
talk
of
pleasanter
things
it
all
settled
as
to
where
my
new
home
shall
be
oh
anne
where
i
do
hope
it
near
here
that
the
drawback
gilbert
is
going
to
settle
at
four
winds
harbor
sixty
miles
from
here
sixty
it
might
as
well
be
six
hundred
sighed
diana
i
never
can
get
further
from
home
now
than
charlottetown
you
have
to
come
to
four
winds
it
the
most
beautiful
harbor
on
the
island
there
a
little
village
called
glen
mary
at
its
head
and
david
blythe
has
been
practicing
there
for
fifty
years
he
is
gilbert
you
know
he
is
going
to
retire
and
gilbert
is
to
take
over
his
practice
blythe
is
going
to
keep
his
house
though
so
we
shall
have
to
find
a
habitation
for
ourselves
i
know
yet
what
it
is
or
where
it
will
be
in
reality
but
i
have
a
little
house
all
furnished
in
my
imagination
a
tiny
delightful
castle
in
spain
where
are
you
going
for
your
wedding
tour
asked
diana
nowhere
do
look
horrified
diana
dearest
you
suggest
harmon
andrews
she
no
doubt
will
remark
condescendingly
that
people
who
ca
afford
wedding
are
real
sensible
not
to
take
them
and
then
she
remind
me
that
jane
went
to
europe
for
hers
i
want
to
spend
my
honeymoon
at
four
winds
in
my
own
dear
house
of
dreams
and
you
decided
not
to
have
any
bridesmaid
there
is
any
one
to
have
you
and
phil
and
priscilla
and
jane
all
stole
a
march
on
me
in
the
matter
of
marriage
and
stella
is
teaching
in
vancouver
i
have
no
other
soul
and
i
wo
have
a
bridesmaid
who
is
but
you
are
going
to
wear
a
veil
are
you
asked
diana
anxiously
yes
indeedy
i
should
feel
like
a
bride
without
one
i
remember
telling
matthew
that
evening
when
he
brought
me
to
green
gables
that
i
never
expected
to
be
a
bride
because
i
was
so
homely
no
one
would
ever
want
to
marry
me
unless
some
foreign
missionary
did
i
had
an
idea
then
that
foreign
missionaries
could
afford
to
be
finicky
in
the
matter
of
looks
if
they
wanted
a
girl
to
risk
her
life
among
cannibals
you
should
have
seen
the
foreign
missionary
priscilla
married
he
was
as
handsome
and
inscrutable
as
those
daydreams
we
once
planned
to
marry
ourselves
diana
he
was
the
best
dressed
man
i
ever
met
and
he
raved
over
priscilla
golden
beauty
but
of
course
there
are
no
cannibals
in
japan
your
wedding
dress
is
a
dream
anyhow
sighed
diana
rapturously
you
look
like
a
perfect
queen
in
it
you
so
tall
and
slender
how
do
you
keep
so
slim
anne
i
fatter
than
ever
i
soon
have
no
waist
at
all
stoutness
and
slimness
seem
to
be
matters
of
predestination
said
anne
at
all
events
harmon
andrews
ca
say
to
you
what
she
said
to
me
when
i
came
home
from
summerside
anne
you
just
about
as
skinny
as
ever
it
sounds
quite
romantic
to
be
but
has
a
very
different
tang
harmon
has
been
talking
about
your
trousseau
she
admits
it
as
nice
as
jane
although
she
says
jane
married
a
millionaire
and
you
are
only
marrying
a
young
doctor
without
a
cent
to
his
name
anne
laughed
my
dresses
are
nice
i
love
pretty
things
i
remember
the
first
pretty
dress
i
ever
had
the
brown
gloria
matthew
gave
me
for
our
school
concert
before
that
everything
i
had
was
so
ugly
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
stepped
into
a
new
world
that
night
that
was
the
night
gilbert
recited
on
the
rhine
and
looked
at
you
when
he
said
another
not
a
sister
and
you
were
so
furious
because
he
put
your
pink
tissue
rose
in
his
breast
pocket
you
did
much
imagine
then
that
you
would
ever
marry
him
oh
well
that
another
instance
of
predestination
laughed
anne
as
they
went
down
the
garret
stairs
chapter
the
house
of
dreams
there
was
more
excitement
in
the
air
of
green
gables
than
there
had
ever
been
before
in
all
its
history
even
marilla
was
so
excited
that
she
could
help
showing
it
which
was
little
short
of
being
phenomenal
there
never
been
a
wedding
in
this
house
she
said
half
apologetically
to
rachel
lynde
when
i
was
a
child
i
heard
an
old
minister
say
that
a
house
was
not
a
real
home
until
it
had
been
consecrated
by
a
birth
a
wedding
and
a
death
we
had
deaths
here
my
father
and
mother
died
here
as
well
as
matthew
and
we
even
had
a
birth
here
long
ago
just
after
we
moved
into
this
house
we
had
a
married
hired
man
for
a
little
while
and
his
wife
had
a
baby
here
but
there
never
been
a
wedding
before
it
does
seem
so
strange
to
think
of
anne
being
married
in
a
way
she
just
seems
to
me
the
little
girl
matthew
brought
home
here
fourteen
years
ago
i
realize
that
she
grown
up
i
shall
never
forget
what
i
felt
when
i
saw
matthew
bringing
in
a
girl
i
wonder
what
became
of
the
boy
we
would
have
got
if
there
had
been
a
mistake
i
wonder
what
his
fate
was
well
it
was
a
fortunate
mistake
said
rachel
lynde
though
mind
you
there
was
a
time
i
did
think
so
that
evening
i
came
up
to
see
anne
and
she
treated
us
to
such
a
scene
many
things
have
changed
since
then
that
what
rachel
sighed
and
then
brisked
up
again
when
weddings
were
in
order
rachel
was
ready
to
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
i
going
to
give
anne
two
of
my
cotton
warp
spreads
she
resumed
a
one
and
an
one
she
tells
me
getting
to
be
real
fashionable
again
well
fashion
or
no
fashion
i
do
believe
there
anything
prettier
for
a
bed
than
a
nice
spread
that
what
i
must
see
about
getting
them
bleached
i
had
them
sewed
up
in
cotton
bags
ever
since
thomas
died
and
no
doubt
they
an
awful
color
but
there
a
month
yet
and
will
work
wonders
only
a
month
marilla
sighed
and
then
said
proudly
i
giving
anne
that
half
dozen
braided
rugs
i
have
in
the
garret
i
never
supposed
she
want
them
they
so
and
nobody
seems
to
want
anything
but
hooked
mats
now
but
she
asked
me
for
them
said
she
rather
have
them
than
anything
else
for
her
floors
they
are
pretty
i
made
them
of
the
nicest
rags
and
braided
them
in
stripes
it
was
such
company
these
last
few
winters
and
i
make
her
enough
blue
plum
preserve
to
stock
her
jam
closet
for
a
year
it
seems
real
strange
those
blue
plum
trees
had
even
a
blossom
for
three
years
and
i
thought
they
might
as
well
be
cut
down
and
this
last
spring
they
were
white
and
such
a
crop
of
plums
i
never
remember
at
green
gables
well
thank
goodness
that
anne
and
gilbert
really
are
going
to
be
married
after
all
it
what
i
always
prayed
for
said
rachel
in
the
tone
of
one
who
is
comfortably
sure
that
her
prayers
have
availed
much
it
was
a
great
relief
to
find
out
that
she
really
did
mean
to
take
the
kingsport
man
he
was
rich
to
be
sure
and
gilbert
is
poor
at
least
to
begin
with
but
then
he
an
island
boy
he
gilbert
blythe
said
marilla
contentedly
marilla
would
have
died
the
death
before
she
would
have
put
into
words
the
thought
that
was
always
in
the
background
of
her
mind
whenever
she
had
looked
at
gilbert
from
his
childhood
up
the
thought
that
had
it
not
been
for
her
own
wilful
pride
long
long
ago
he
might
have
been
her
son
marilla
felt
that
in
some
strange
way
his
marriage
with
anne
would
put
right
that
old
mistake
good
had
come
out
of
the
evil
of
the
ancient
bitterness
as
for
anne
herself
she
was
so
happy
that
she
almost
felt
frightened
the
gods
so
says
the
old
superstition
do
not
like
to
behold
too
happy
mortals
it
is
certain
at
least
that
some
human
beings
do
not
two
of
that
ilk
descended
upon
anne
one
violet
dusk
and
proceeded
to
do
what
in
them
lay
to
prick
the
rainbow
bubble
of
her
satisfaction
if
she
thought
she
was
getting
any
particular
prize
in
young
blythe
or
if
she
imagined
that
he
was
still
as
infatuated
with
her
as
he
might
have
been
in
his
salad
days
it
was
surely
their
duty
to
put
the
matter
before
her
in
another
light
yet
these
two
worthy
ladies
were
not
enemies
of
anne
on
the
contrary
they
were
really
quite
fond
of
her
and
would
have
defended
her
as
their
own
young
had
anyone
else
attacked
her
human
nature
is
not
obliged
to
be
consistent
inglis
nee
jane
andrews
to
quote
from
the
daily
enterprise
came
with
her
mother
and
jasper
bell
but
in
jane
the
milk
of
human
kindness
had
not
been
curdled
by
years
of
matrimonial
bickerings
her
lines
had
fallen
in
pleasant
places
in
spite
of
the
fact
as
rachel
lynde
would
say
that
she
had
married
a
millionaire
her
marriage
had
been
happy
wealth
had
not
spoiled
her
she
was
still
the
placid
amiable
jane
of
the
old
quartette
sympathising
with
her
old
chum
happiness
and
as
keenly
interested
in
all
the
dainty
details
of
anne
trousseau
as
if
it
could
rival
her
own
silken
and
bejewelled
splendors
jane
was
not
brilliant
and
had
probably
never
made
a
remark
worth
listening
to
in
her
life
but
she
never
said
anything
that
would
hurt
anyone
feelings
which
may
be
a
negative
talent
but
is
likewise
a
rare
and
enviable
one
so
gilbert
did
go
back
on
you
after
all
said
harmon
andrews
contriving
to
convey
an
expression
of
surprise
in
her
tone
well
the
blythes
generally
keep
their
word
when
they
once
passed
it
no
matter
what
happens
let
me
see
you
are
you
anne
when
i
was
a
girl
was
the
first
corner
but
you
look
quite
young
people
always
do
red
hair
is
very
fashionable
now
said
anne
trying
to
smile
but
speaking
rather
coldly
life
had
developed
in
her
a
sense
of
humor
which
helped
her
over
many
difficulties
but
as
yet
nothing
had
availed
to
steel
her
against
a
reference
to
her
hair
so
it
is
so
it
is
conceded
harmon
there
no
telling
what
queer
freaks
fashion
will
take
well
anne
your
things
are
very
pretty
and
very
suitable
to
your
position
in
life
are
they
jane
i
hope
you
be
very
happy
you
have
my
best
wishes
i
sure
a
long
engagement
does
often
turn
out
well
but
of
course
in
your
case
it
could
be
helped
gilbert
looks
very
young
for
a
doctor
i
afraid
people
wo
have
much
confidence
in
him
said
jasper
bell
gloomily
then
she
shut
her
mouth
tightly
as
if
she
had
said
what
she
considered
it
her
duty
to
say
and
held
her
conscience
clear
she
belonged
to
the
type
which
always
has
a
stringy
black
feather
in
its
hat
and
straggling
locks
of
hair
on
its
neck
anne
surface
pleasure
in
her
pretty
bridal
things
was
temporarily
shadowed
but
the
deeps
of
happiness
below
could
not
thus
be
disturbed
and
the
little
stings
of
mesdames
bell
and
andrews
were
forgotten
when
gilbert
came
later
and
they
wandered
down
to
the
birches
of
the
brook
which
had
been
saplings
when
anne
had
come
to
green
gables
but
were
now
tall
ivory
columns
in
a
fairy
palace
of
twilight
and
stars
in
their
shadows
anne
and
gilbert
talked
in
of
their
new
home
and
their
new
life
together
i
found
a
nest
for
us
anne
oh
where
not
right
in
the
village
i
hope
i
would
like
that
altogether
no
there
was
no
house
to
be
had
in
the
village
this
is
a
little
white
house
on
the
harbor
shore
half
way
between
glen
mary
and
four
winds
point
it
a
little
out
of
the
way
but
when
we
get
a
in
that
wo
matter
so
much
the
situation
is
beautiful
it
looks
to
the
sunset
and
has
the
great
blue
harbor
before
it
the
are
very
far
away
the
sea
winds
blow
over
them
and
the
sea
spray
drenches
them
but
the
house
itself
gilbert
our
first
home
what
is
it
like
not
very
large
but
large
enough
for
us
there
a
splendid
living
room
with
a
fireplace
in
it
downstairs
and
a
dining
room
that
looks
out
on
the
harbor
and
a
little
room
that
will
do
for
my
office
it
is
about
sixty
years
old
the
oldest
house
in
four
winds
but
it
has
been
kept
in
pretty
good
repair
and
was
all
done
over
about
fifteen
years
ago
shingled
plastered
and
it
was
well
built
to
begin
with
i
understand
that
there
was
some
romantic
story
connected
with
its
building
but
the
man
i
rented
it
from
did
know
it
he
said
captain
jim
was
the
only
one
who
could
spin
that
old
yarn
now
who
is
captain
jim
the
keeper
of
the
lighthouse
on
four
winds
point
you
love
that
four
winds
light
anne
it
a
revolving
one
and
it
flashes
like
a
magnificent
star
through
the
twilights
we
can
see
it
from
our
living
room
windows
and
our
front
door
who
owns
the
house
well
it
the
property
of
the
glen
mary
presbyterian
church
now
and
i
rented
it
from
the
trustees
but
it
belonged
until
lately
to
a
very
old
lady
miss
elizabeth
russell
she
died
last
spring
and
as
she
had
no
near
relatives
she
left
her
property
to
the
glen
mary
church
her
furniture
is
still
in
the
house
and
i
bought
most
of
it
for
a
mere
song
you
might
say
because
it
was
all
so
that
the
trustees
despaired
of
selling
it
glen
mary
folks
prefer
plush
brocade
and
sideboards
with
mirrors
and
ornamentations
i
fancy
but
miss
russell
furniture
is
very
good
and
i
feel
sure
you
like
it
anne
so
far
good
said
anne
nodding
cautious
approval
but
gilbert
people
can
not
live
by
furniture
alone
you
have
yet
mentioned
one
very
important
thing
are
there
trees
about
this
house
heaps
of
them
oh
dryad
there
is
a
big
grove
of
fir
trees
behind
it
two
rows
of
lombardy
poplars
down
the
lane
and
a
ring
of
white
birches
around
a
very
delightful
garden
our
front
door
opens
right
into
the
garden
but
there
is
another
entrance
a
little
gate
hung
between
two
firs
the
hinges
are
on
one
trunk
and
the
catch
on
the
other
their
boughs
form
an
arch
overhead
oh
i
so
glad
i
could
live
where
there
were
no
trees
something
vital
in
me
would
starve
well
after
that
there
no
use
asking
you
if
there
a
brook
anywhere
near
that
would
be
expecting
too
much
but
there
is
a
brook
and
it
actually
cuts
across
one
corner
of
the
garden
then
said
anne
with
a
long
sigh
of
supreme
satisfaction
this
house
you
have
found
is
my
house
of
dreams
and
none
other
chapter
the
land
of
dreams
among
have
you
made
up
your
mind
who
you
going
to
have
to
the
wedding
anne
asked
rachel
lynde
as
she
hemstitched
table
napkins
industriously
it
time
your
invitations
were
sent
even
if
they
are
to
be
only
informal
ones
i
do
mean
to
have
very
many
said
anne
we
just
want
those
we
love
best
to
see
us
married
gilbert
people
and
and
allan
and
and
mrs
harrison
there
was
a
time
when
you
hardly
have
numbered
harrison
among
your
dearest
friends
said
marilla
drily
well
i
was
very
strongly
attracted
to
him
at
our
first
meeting
acknowledged
anne
with
a
laugh
over
the
recollection
but
harrison
has
improved
on
acquaintance
and
harrison
is
really
a
dear
then
of
course
there
are
miss
lavendar
and
paul
have
they
decided
to
come
to
the
island
this
summer
i
thought
they
were
going
to
europe
they
changed
their
minds
when
i
wrote
them
i
was
going
to
be
married
i
had
a
letter
from
paul
today
he
says
he
must
come
to
my
wedding
no
matter
what
happens
to
europe
that
child
always
idolised
you
remarked
rachel
that
is
a
young
man
of
nineteen
now
mrs
lynde
how
time
does
fly
was
lynde
brilliant
and
original
response
charlotta
the
fourth
may
come
with
them
she
sent
word
by
paul
that
she
would
come
if
her
husband
would
let
her
i
wonder
if
she
still
wears
those
enormous
blue
bows
and
whether
her
husband
calls
her
charlotta
or
leonora
i
should
love
to
have
charlotta
at
my
wedding
charlotta
and
i
were
at
a
wedding
long
syne
they
expect
to
be
at
echo
lodge
next
week
then
there
are
phil
and
the
reverend
jo
it
sounds
awful
to
hear
you
speaking
of
a
minister
like
that
anne
said
rachel
severely
his
wife
calls
him
that
she
should
have
more
respect
for
his
holy
office
then
retorted
rachel
i
heard
you
criticise
ministers
pretty
sharply
yourself
teased
anne
yes
but
i
do
it
reverently
protested
lynde
you
never
heard
me
nickname
a
minister
anne
smothered
a
smile
well
there
are
diana
and
fred
and
little
fred
and
small
anne
cordelia
and
jane
andrews
i
wish
i
could
have
miss
stacey
and
aunt
jamesina
and
priscilla
and
stella
but
stella
is
in
vancouver
and
pris
is
in
japan
and
miss
stacey
is
married
in
california
and
aunt
jamesina
has
gone
to
india
to
explore
her
daughter
mission
field
in
spite
of
her
horror
of
snakes
it
really
dreadful
the
way
people
get
scattered
over
the
globe
the
lord
never
intended
it
that
what
said
rachel
authoritatively
in
my
young
days
people
grew
up
and
married
and
settled
down
where
they
were
born
or
pretty
near
it
thank
goodness
you
stuck
to
the
island
anne
i
was
afraid
gilbert
would
insist
on
rushing
off
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
when
he
got
through
college
and
dragging
you
with
him
if
everybody
stayed
where
he
was
born
places
would
soon
be
filled
up
mrs
lynde
oh
i
not
going
to
argue
with
you
anne
am
not
a
what
time
of
the
day
is
the
ceremony
to
be
we
have
decided
on
noon
high
noon
as
the
society
reporters
say
that
will
give
us
time
to
catch
the
evening
train
to
glen
st
mary
and
you
be
married
in
the
parlor
no
not
unless
it
rains
we
mean
to
be
married
in
the
orchard
with
the
blue
sky
over
us
and
the
sunshine
around
us
do
you
know
when
and
where
i
like
to
be
married
if
i
could
it
would
be
at
dawn
a
june
dawn
with
a
glorious
sunrise
and
roses
blooming
in
the
gardens
and
i
would
slip
down
and
meet
gilbert
and
we
would
go
together
to
the
heart
of
the
beech
woods
and
there
under
the
green
arches
that
would
be
like
a
splendid
cathedral
we
would
be
married
marilla
sniffed
scornfully
and
lynde
looked
shocked
but
that
would
be
terrible
queer
anne
why
it
would
really
seem
legal
and
what
would
harmon
andrews
say
ah
there
the
rub
sighed
anne
there
are
so
many
things
in
life
we
can
not
do
because
of
the
fear
of
what
harmon
andrews
would
say
true
is
pity
and
pity
is
is
true
what
delightful
things
we
might
do
were
it
not
for
harmon
andrews
by
times
anne
i
do
feel
quite
sure
that
i
understand
you
altogether
complained
lynde
anne
was
always
romantic
you
know
said
marilla
apologetically
well
married
life
will
most
likely
cure
her
of
that
rachel
responded
comfortingly
anne
laughed
and
slipped
away
to
lover
lane
where
gilbert
found
her
and
neither
of
them
seemed
to
entertain
much
fear
or
hope
that
their
married
life
would
cure
them
of
romance
the
echo
lodge
people
came
over
the
next
week
and
green
gables
buzzed
with
the
delight
of
them
miss
lavendar
had
changed
so
little
that
the
three
years
since
her
last
island
visit
might
have
been
a
watch
in
the
night
but
anne
gasped
with
amazement
over
paul
could
this
splendid
six
feet
of
manhood
be
the
little
paul
of
avonlea
schooldays
you
really
make
me
feel
old
paul
said
anne
why
i
have
to
look
up
to
you
you
never
grow
old
teacher
said
paul
you
are
one
of
the
fortunate
mortals
who
have
found
and
drunk
from
the
fountain
of
youth
you
and
mother
lavendar
see
here
when
you
married
i
wo
call
you
blythe
to
me
you
always
be
the
teacher
of
the
best
lessons
i
ever
learned
i
want
to
show
you
something
the
something
was
a
pocketbook
full
of
poems
paul
had
put
some
of
his
beautiful
fancies
into
verse
and
magazine
editors
had
not
been
as
unappreciative
as
they
are
sometimes
supposed
to
be
anne
read
poems
with
real
delight
they
were
full
of
charm
and
promise
you
be
famous
yet
paul
i
always
dreamed
of
having
one
famous
pupil
he
was
to
be
a
college
president
but
a
great
poet
would
be
even
better
some
day
i
be
able
to
boast
that
i
whipped
the
distinguished
paul
irving
but
then
i
never
did
whip
you
did
i
paul
what
an
opportunity
lost
i
think
i
kept
you
in
at
recess
however
you
may
be
famous
yourself
teacher
i
seen
a
good
deal
of
your
work
these
last
three
years
no
i
know
what
i
can
do
i
can
write
pretty
fanciful
little
sketches
that
children
love
and
editors
send
welcome
cheques
for
but
i
can
do
nothing
big
my
only
chance
for
earthly
immortality
is
a
corner
in
your
memoirs
charlotta
the
fourth
had
discarded
the
blue
bows
but
her
freckles
were
not
noticeably
less
i
never
did
think
i
come
down
to
marrying
a
yankee
miss
shirley
she
said
but
you
never
know
what
before
you
and
it
his
fault
he
was
born
that
way
you
a
yankee
yourself
charlotta
since
you
married
one
miss
shirley
i
not
and
i
would
be
if
i
was
to
marry
a
dozen
yankees
tom
kind
of
nice
and
besides
i
thought
i
better
not
be
too
hard
to
please
for
i
might
get
another
chance
tom
do
drink
and
he
do
growl
because
he
has
to
work
between
meals
and
when
all
said
and
done
i
satisfied
miss
shirley
does
he
call
you
leonora
asked
anne
goodness
no
miss
shirley
i
would
know
who
he
meant
if
he
did
of
course
when
we
got
married
he
had
to
say
take
thee
leonora
and
i
declare
to
you
miss
shirley
i
had
the
most
dreadful
feeling
ever
since
that
it
was
me
he
was
talking
to
and
i
have
been
rightly
married
at
all
and
so
you
going
to
be
married
yourself
miss
shirley
i
always
thought
i
like
to
marry
a
doctor
it
would
be
so
handy
when
the
children
had
measles
and
croup
tom
is
only
a
bricklayer
but
he
real
when
i
said
to
him
says
i
can
i
go
to
miss
shirley
wedding
i
mean
to
go
anyhow
but
i
like
to
have
your
consent
he
just
says
yourself
charlotta
and
you
suit
me
that
a
real
pleasant
kind
of
husband
to
have
miss
shirley
philippa
and
her
reverend
jo
arrived
at
green
gables
the
day
before
the
wedding
anne
and
phil
had
a
rapturous
meeting
which
presently
simmered
down
to
a
cosy
confidential
chat
over
all
that
had
been
and
was
about
to
be
queen
anne
you
as
queenly
as
ever
i
got
fearfully
thin
since
the
babies
came
i
not
half
so
but
i
think
jo
likes
it
there
not
such
a
contrast
between
us
you
see
and
oh
perfectly
magnificent
that
you
going
to
marry
gilbert
roy
gardner
would
have
done
at
all
at
all
i
can
see
that
now
though
i
was
horribly
disappointed
at
the
time
you
know
anne
you
did
treat
roy
very
badly
he
has
recovered
i
understand
smiled
anne
oh
yes
he
is
married
and
his
wife
is
a
sweet
little
thing
and
they
perfectly
happy
everything
works
together
for
good
jo
and
the
bible
say
that
and
they
are
pretty
good
authorities
are
alec
and
alonzo
married
yet
alec
is
but
alonzo
is
how
those
dear
old
days
at
patty
place
come
back
when
i
talking
to
you
anne
what
fun
we
had
have
you
been
to
patty

and
magog
to
the
left
just
fancy
those
lovely
old
dogs
sitting
by
the
fireplace
in
my
house
of
dreams
said
anne
rapturously
i
never
expected
anything
so
delightful
that
evening
green
gables
hummed
with
preparations
for
the
following
day
but
in
the
twilight
anne
slipped
away
she
had
a
little
pilgrimage
to
make
on
this
last
day
of
her
girlhood
and
she
must
make
it
alone
she
went
to
matthew
grave
in
the
little
avonlea
graveyard
and
there
kept
a
silent
tryst
with
old
memories
and
immortal
loves
how
glad
matthew
would
be
tomorrow
if
he
were
here
she
whispered
but
i
believe
he
does
know
and
is
glad
of
it
somewhere
else
read
somewhere
that
dead
are
never
dead
until
we
have
forgotten
them
matthew
will
never
be
dead
to
me
for
i
can
never
forget
him
she
left
on
his
grave
the
flowers
she
had
brought
and
walked
slowly
down
the
long
hill
it
was
a
gracious
evening
full
of
delectable
lights
and
shadows
in
the
west
was
a
sky
of
mackerel
clouds
crimson
and
with
long
strips
of
sky
between
beyond
was
the
glimmering
radiance
of
a
sunset
sea
and
the
ceaseless
voice
of
many
waters
came
up
from
the
tawny
shore
all
around
her
lying
in
the
fine
beautiful
country
silence
were
the
hills
and
fields
and
woods
she
had
known
and
loved
so
long
history
repeats
itself
said
gilbert
joining
her
as
she
passed
the
blythe
gate
do
you
remember
our
first
walk
down
this
hill
anne
our
first
walk
together
anywhere
for
that
matter
i
was
coming
home
in
the
twilight
from
matthew
grave
and
you
came
out
of
the
gate
and
i
swallowed
the
pride
of
years
and
spoke
to
you
and
all
heaven
opened
before
me
supplemented
gilbert
from
that
moment
i
looked
forward
to
tomorrow
when
i
left
you
at
your
gate
that
night
and
walked
home
i
was
the
happiest
boy
in
the
world
anne
had
forgiven
me
i
think
you
had
the
most
to
forgive
i
was
an
ungrateful
little
wretch
and
after
you
had
really
saved
my
life
that
day
on
the
pond
too
how
i
loathed
that
load
of
obligation
at
first
i
do
deserve
the
happiness
that
has
come
to
me
gilbert
laughed
and
clasped
tighter
the
girlish
hand
that
wore
his
ring
anne
engagement
ring
was
a
circlet
of
pearls
she
had
refused
to
wear
a
diamond
i
never
really
liked
diamonds
since
i
found
out
they
were
the
lovely
purple
i
had
dreamed
they
will
always
suggest
my
old
disappointment
but
pearls
are
for
tears
the
old
legend
says
gilbert
had
objected
i
not
afraid
of
that
and
tears
can
be
happy
as
well
as
sad
my
very
happiest
moments
have
been
when
i
had
tears
in
my
eyes
when
marilla
told
me
i
might
stay
at
green
gables
when
matthew
gave
me
the
first
pretty
dress
i
ever
had
when
i
heard
that
you
were
going
to
recover
from
the
fever
so
give
me
pearls
for
our
troth
ring
gilbert
and
i
willingly
accept
the
sorrow
of
life
with
its
joy
but
tonight
our
lovers
thought
only
of
joy
and
never
of
sorrow
for
the
morrow
was
their
wedding
day
and
their
house
of
dreams
awaited
them
on
the
misty
purple
shore
of
four
winds
harbor
chapter
the
first
bride
of
green
gables
anne
wakened
on
the
morning
of
her
wedding
day
to
find
the
sunshine
winking
in
at
the
window
of
the
little
porch
gable
and
a
september
breeze
frolicking
with
her
curtains
i
so
glad
the
sun
will
shine
on
me
she
thought
happily
she
recalled
the
first
morning
she
had
wakened
in
that
little
porch
room
when
the
sunshine
had
crept
in
on
her
through
the
of
the
old
snow
queen
that
had
not
been
a
happy
wakening
for
it
brought
with
it
the
bitter
disappointment
of
the
preceding
night
but
since
then
the
little
room
had
been
endeared
and
consecrated
by
years
of
happy
childhood
dreams
and
maiden
visions
to
it
she
had
come
back
joyfully
after
all
her
absences
at
its
window
she
had
knelt
through
that
night
of
bitter
agony
when
she
believed
gilbert
dying
and
by
it
she
had
sat
in
speechless
happiness
the
night
of
her
betrothal
many
vigils
of
joy
and
some
of
sorrow
had
been
kept
there
and
today
she
must
leave
it
forever
henceforth
it
would
be
hers
no
more
dora
was
to
inherit
it
when
she
had
gone
nor
did
anne
wish
it
otherwise
the
little
room
was
sacred
to
youth
and
girlhood
to
the
past
that
was
to
close
today
before
the
chapter
of
wifehood
opened
green
gables
was
a
busy
and
joyous
house
that
forenoon
diana
arrived
early
with
little
fred
and
small
anne
cordelia
to
lend
a
hand
davy
and
dora
the
green
gables
twins
whisked
the
babies
off
to
the
garden
do
let
small
anne
cordelia
spoil
her
clothes
warned
diana
anxiously
you
need
be
afraid
to
trust
her
with
dora
said
marilla
that
child
is
more
sensible
and
careful
than
most
of
the
mothers
i
known
she
really
a
wonder
in
some
ways
not
much
like
that
other
i
brought
up
marilla
smiled
across
her
chicken
salad
at
anne
it
might
even
be
suspected
that
she
liked
the
best
after
all
those
twins
are
real
nice
children
said
rachel
when
she
was
sure
they
were
out
of
earshot
dora
is
so
womanly
and
helpful
and
davy
is
developing
into
a
very
smart
boy
he
is
the
holy
terror
for
mischief
he
used
to
be
i
never
was
so
distracted
in
my
life
as
i
was
the
first
six
months
he
was
here
acknowledged
marilla
after
that
i
suppose
i
got
used
to
him
he
taken
a
great
notion
to
farming
lately
and
wants
me
to
let
him
try
running
the
farm
next
year
i
may
for
barry
does
think
he
want
to
rent
it
much
longer
and
some
new
arrangement
will
have
to
be
made
well
you
certainly
have
a
lovely
day
for
your
wedding
anne
said
diana
as
she
slipped
a
voluminous
apron
over
her
silken
array
you
could
have
had
a
finer
one
if
you
ordered
it
from
eaton
indeed
there
too
much
money
going
out
of
this
island
to
that
same
eaton
said
lynde
indignantly
she
had
strong
views
on
the
subject
of
department
stores
and
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
airing
them
and
as
for
those
catalogues
of
theirs
they
the
avonlea
girls
bible
now
that
what
they
pore
over
them
on
sundays
instead
of
studying
the
holy
scriptures
well
they
splendid
to
amuse
children
with
said
diana
fred
and
small
anne
look
at
the
pictures
by
the
hour
amused
ten
children
without
the
aid
of
eaton
catalogue
said
rachel
severely
come
you
two
do
quarrel
over
eaton
catalogue
said
anne
gaily
this
is
my
day
of
days
you
know
i
so
happy
i
want
every
one
else
to
be
happy
too
i
sure
i
hope
your
happiness
will
last
child
sighed
rachel
she
did
hope
it
truly
and
believed
it
but
she
was
afraid
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
challenge
to
providence
to
flaunt
your
happiness
too
openly
anne
for
her
own
good
must
be
toned
down
a
trifle
but
it
was
a
happy
and
beautiful
bride
who
came
down
the
old
stairs
that
september
noon
the
first
bride
of
green
gables
slender
and
in
the
mist
of
her
maiden
veil
with
her
arms
full
of
roses
gilbert
waiting
for
her
in
the
hall
below
looked
up
at
her
with
adoring
eyes
she
was
his
at
last
this
evasive
anne
won
after
years
of
patient
waiting
it
was
to
him
she
was
coming
in
the
sweet
surrender
of
the
bride
was
he
worthy
of
her
could
he
make
her
as
happy
as
he
hoped
if
he
failed
her
if
he
could
not
measure
up
to
her
standard
of
manhood
then
as
she
held
out
her
hand
their
eyes
met
and
all
doubt
was
swept
away
in
a
glad
certainty
they
belonged
to
each
other
and
no
matter
what
life
might
hold
for
them
it
could
never
alter
that
their
happiness
was
in
each
other
keeping
and
both
were
unafraid
they
were
married
in
the
sunshine
of
the
old
orchard
circled
by
the
loving
and
kindly
faces
of
friends
allan
married
them
and
the
reverend
jo
made
what
rachel
lynde
afterwards
pronounced
to
be
the
most
beautiful
wedding
prayer
she
had
ever
heard
birds
do
not
often
sing
in
september
but
one
sang
sweetly
from
some
hidden
bough
while
gilbert
and
anne
repeated
their
deathless
vows
anne
heard
it
and
thrilled
to
it
gilbert
heard
it
and
wondered
only
that
all
the
birds
in
the
world
had
not
burst
into
jubilant
song
paul
heard
it
and
later
wrote
a
lyric
about
it
which
was
one
of
the
most
admired
in
his
first
volume
of
verse
charlotta
the
fourth
heard
it
and
was
blissfully
sure
it
meant
good
luck
for
her
adored
miss
shirley
the
bird
sang
until
the
ceremony
was
ended
and
then
it
wound
up
with
one
mad
little
glad
little
trill
never
had
the
old
house
among
its
enfolding
orchards
known
a
blither
merrier
afternoon
all
the
old
jests
and
quips
that
must
have
done
duty
at
weddings
since
eden
were
served
up
and
seemed
as
new
and
brilliant
and
as
if
they
had
never
been
uttered
before
laughter
and
joy
had
their
way
and
when
anne
and
gilbert
left
to
catch
the
carmody
train
with
paul
as
driver
the
twins
were
ready
with
rice
and
old
shoes
in
the
throwing
of
which
charlotta
the
fourth
and
harrison
bore
a
valiant
part
marilla
stood
at
the
gate
and
watched
the
carriage
out
of
sight
down
the
long
lane
with
its
banks
of
goldenrod
anne
turned
at
its
end
to
wave
her
last
she
was
gone
green
gables
was
her
home
no
more
marilla
face
looked
very
gray
and
old
as
she
turned
to
the
house
which
anne
had
filled
for
fourteen
years
and
even
in
her
absence
with
light
and
life
but
diana
and
her
small
fry
the
echo
lodge
people
and
the
allans
had
stayed
to
help
the
two
old
ladies
over
the
loneliness
of
the
first
evening
and
they
contrived
to
have
a
quietly
pleasant
little
supper
time
sitting
long
around
the
table
and
chatting
over
all
the
details
of
the
day
while
they
were
sitting
there
anne
and
gilbert
were
alighting
from
the
train
at
glen
mary
chapter
the
home
coming
david
blythe
had
sent
his
horse
and
buggy
to
meet
them
and
the
urchin
who
had
brought
it
slipped
away
with
a
sympathetic
grin
leaving
them
to
the
delight
of
driving
alone
to
their
new
home
through
the
radiant
evening
anne
never
forgot
the
loveliness
of
the
view
that
broke
upon
them
when
they
had
driven
over
the
hill
behind
the
village
her
new
home
could
not
yet
be
seen
but
before
her
lay
four
winds
harbor
like
a
great
shining
mirror
of
rose
and
silver
far
down
she
saw
its
entrance
between
the
bar
of
sand
dunes
on
one
side
and
a
steep
high
grim
red
sandstone
cliff
on
the
other
beyond
the
bar
the
sea
calm
and
austere
dreamed
in
the
afterlight
the
little
fishing
village
nestled
in
the
cove
where
the
met
the
harbor
shore
looked
like
a
great
opal
in
the
haze
the
sky
over
them
was
like
a
jewelled
cup
from
which
the
dusk
was
pouring
the
air
was
crisp
with
the
compelling
tang
of
the
sea
and
the
whole
landscape
was
infused
with
the
subtleties
of
a
sea
evening
a
few
dim
sails
drifted
along
the
darkening
harbor
shores
a
bell
was
ringing
from
the
tower
of
a
little
white
church
on
the
far
side
mellowly
and
dreamily
sweet
the
chime
floated
across
the
water
blent
with
the
moan
of
the
sea
the
great
revolving
light
on
the
cliff
at
the
channel
flashed
warm
and
golden
against
the
clear
northern
sky
a
trembling
quivering
star
of
good
hope
far
out
along
the
horizon
was
the
crinkled
gray
ribbon
of
a
passing
steamer
smoke
oh
beautiful
beautiful
murmured
anne
i
shall
love
four
winds
gilbert
where
is
our
house
we
ca
see
it
yet
the
belt
of
birch
running
up
from
that
little
cove
hides
it
it
about
two
miles
from
glen
mary
and
another
mile
between
it
and
the
we
wo
have
many
neighbors
anne
there
only
one
house
near
us
and
i
do
know
who
lives
in
it
shall
you
be
lonely
when
i
away
not
with
that
light
and
that
loveliness
for
company
who
lives
in
that
house
gilbert
i
do
know
it
does
look
exactly
as
if
the
occupants
would
be
kindred
spirits
anne
does
it
the
house
was
a
large
substantial
affair
painted
such
a
vivid
green
that
the
landscape
seemed
quite
faded
by
contrast
there
was
an
orchard
behind
it
and
a
nicely
kept
lawn
before
it
but
somehow
there
was
a
certain
bareness
about
it
perhaps
its
neatness
was
responsible
for
this
the
whole
establishment
house
barns
orchard
garden
lawn
and
lane
was
so
starkly
neat
it
does
seem
probable
that
anyone
with
that
taste
in
paint
could
be
very
kindred
acknowledged
anne
unless
it
were
an
accident
like
our
blue
hall
i
feel
certain
there
are
no
children
there
at
least
even
neater
than
the
old
copp
place
on
the
tory
road
and
i
never
expected
to
see
anything
neater
than
that
they
had
not
met
anybody
on
the
moist
red
road
that
wound
along
the
harbor
shore
but
just
before
they
came
to
the
belt
of
birch
which
hid
their
home
anne
saw
a
girl
who
was
driving
a
flock
of
geese
along
the
crest
of
a
velvety
green
hill
on
the
right
great
scattered
firs
grew
along
it
between
their
trunks
one
saw
glimpses
of
yellow
harvest
fields
gleams
of
golden
and
bits
of
blue
sea
the
girl
was
tall
and
wore
a
dress
of
pale
blue
print
she
walked
with
a
certain
springiness
of
step
and
erectness
of
bearing
she
and
her
geese
came
out
of
the
gate
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
as
anne
and
gilbert
passed
she
stood
with
her
hand
on
the
fastening
of
the
gate
and
looked
steadily
at
them
with
an
expression
that
hardly
attained
to
interest
but
did
not
descend
to
curiosity
it
seemed
to
anne
for
a
fleeting
moment
that
there
was
even
a
veiled
hint
of
hostility
in
it
but
it
was
the
girl
beauty
which
made
anne
give
a
little
gasp
a
beauty
so
marked
that
it
must
have
attracted
attention
anywhere
she
was
hatless
but
heavy
braids
of
burnished
hair
the
hue
of
ripe
wheat
were
twisted
about
her
head
like
a
coronet
her
eyes
were
blue
and
her
figure
in
its
plain
print
gown
was
magnificent
and
her
lips
were
as
crimson
as
the
bunch
of
poppies
she
wore
at
her
belt
gilbert
who
is
the
girl
we
have
just
passed
asked
anne
in
a
low
voice
i
did
notice
any
girl
said
gilbert
who
had
eyes
only
for
his
bride
she
was
standing
by
that
gate
no
do
look
back
she
is
still
watching
us
i
never
saw
such
a
beautiful
face
i
do
remember
seeing
any
very
handsome
girls
while
i
was
here
there
are
some
pretty
girls
up
at
the
glen
but
i
hardly
think
they
could
be
called
beautiful
this
girl
is
you
ca
have
seen
her
or
you
would
remember
her
nobody
could
forget
her
i
never
saw
such
a
face
except
in
pictures
and
her
hair
it
made
me
think
of
browning
of
gold
and
snake
probably
she
some
visitor
in
four
winds
likely
some
one
from
that
big
summer
hotel
over
the
harbor
she
wore
a
white
apron
and
she
was
driving
geese
she
might
do
that
for
amusement
look
anne
there
our
house
anne
looked
and
forgot
for
a
time
the
girl
with
the
splendid
resentful
eyes
the
first
glimpse
of
her
new
home
was
a
delight
to
eye
and
spirit
it
looked
so
like
a
big
creamy
seashell
stranded
on
the
harbor
shore
the
rows
of
tall
lombardy
poplars
down
its
lane
stood
out
in
stately
purple
silhouette
against
the
sky
behind
it
sheltering
its
garden
from
the
too
keen
breath
of
sea
winds
was
a
cloudy
fir
wood
in
which
the
winds
might
make
all
kinds
of
weird
and
haunting
music
like
all
woods
it
seemed
to
be
holding
and
enfolding
secrets
in
its
recesses
secrets
whose
charm
is
only
to
be
won
by
entering
in
and
patiently
seeking
outwardly
dark
green
arms
keep
them
inviolate
from
curious
or
indifferent
eyes
the
night
winds
were
beginning
their
wild
dances
beyond
the
bar
and
the
fishing
hamlet
across
the
harbor
was
gemmed
with
lights
as
anne
and
gilbert
drove
up
the
poplar
lane
the
door
of
the
little
house
opened
and
a
warm
glow
of
firelight
flickered
out
into
the
dusk
gilbert
lifted
anne
from
the
buggy
and
led
her
into
the
garden
through
the
little
gate
between
the
firs
up
the
trim
red
path
to
the
sandstone
step
welcome
home
he
whispered
and
hand
in
hand
they
stepped
over
the
threshold
of
their
house
of
dreams
chapter
captain
jim
old
doctor
dave
and
mrs
doctor
dave
had
come
down
to
the
little
house
to
greet
the
bride
and
groom
doctor
dave
was
a
big
jolly
old
fellow
and
mrs
doctor
was
a
trim
little
lady
who
took
anne
at
once
to
her
heart
literally
and
figuratively
i
so
glad
to
see
you
dear
you
must
be
real
tired
we
got
a
bite
of
supper
ready
and
captain
jim
brought
up
some
trout
for
you
captain
jim
where
are
you
oh
he
slipped
out
to
see
to
the
horse
i
suppose
come
upstairs
and
take
your
things
off
anne
looked
about
her
with
bright
appreciative
eyes
as
she
followed
mrs
doctor
dave
upstairs
she
liked
the
appearance
of
her
new
home
very
much
it
seemed
to
have
the
atmosphere
of
green
gables
and
the
flavor
of
her
old
traditions
i
think
i
would
have
found
miss
elizabeth
russell
a
spirit
she
murmured
when
she
was
alone
in
her
room
there
were
two
windows
in
it
the
dormer
one
looked
out
on
the
lower
harbor
and
the
and
the
four
winds
light
a
magic
casement
opening
on
the
foam
of
perilous
seas
in
fairy
lands
forlorn
quoted
anne
softly
the
gable
window
gave
a
view
of
a
little
valley
through
which
a
brook
ran
half
a
mile
up
the
brook
was
the
only
house
in
sight
an
old
rambling
gray
one
surrounded
by
huge
willows
through
which
its
windows
peered
like
shy
seeking
eyes
into
the
dusk
anne
wondered
who
lived
there
they
would
be
her
nearest
neighbors
and
she
hoped
they
would
be
nice
she
suddenly
found
herself
thinking
of
the
beautiful
girl
with
the
white
geese
gilbert
thought
she
did
belong
here
mused
anne
but
i
feel
sure
she
does
there
was
something
about
her
that
made
her
part
of
the
sea
and
the
sky
and
the
harbor
four
winds
is
in
her
blood
when
anne
went
downstairs
gilbert
was
standing
before
the
fireplace
talking
to
a
stranger
both
turned
as
anne
entered
anne
this
is
captain
boyd
captain
boyd
my
wife
it
was
the
first
time
gilbert
had
said
my
wife
to
anybody
but
anne
and
he
narrowly
escaped
bursting
with
the
pride
of
it
the
old
captain
held
out
a
sinewy
hand
to
anne
they
smiled
at
each
other
and
were
friends
from
that
moment
kindred
spirit
flashed
recognition
to
kindred
spirit
i
right
down
pleased
to
meet
you
mistress
blythe
and
i
hope
be
as
happy
as
the
first
bride
was
who
came
here
i
ca
wish
you
no
better
than
that
but
your
husband
does
introduce
me
jest
exactly
right
jim
is
my
name
and
you
might
as
well
begin
as
you
sartain
to
end
up
calling
me
that
you
sartainly
are
a
nice
little
bride
mistress
blythe
looking
at
you
sorter
makes
me
feel
that
i
jest
been
married
myself
amid
the
laughter
that
followed
mrs
doctor
dave
urged
captain
jim
to
stay
and
have
supper
with
them
thank
you
kindly
be
a
real
treat
mistress
doctor
i
mostly
has
to
eat
my
meals
alone
with
the
reflection
of
my
ugly
old
phiz
in
a
opposite
for
company
is
often
i
have
a
chance
to
sit
down
with
two
such
sweet
purty
ladies
captain
jim
compliments
may
look
very
bald
on
paper
but
he
paid
them
with
such
a
gracious
gentle
deference
of
tone
and
look
that
the
woman
upon
whom
they
were
bestowed
felt
that
she
was
being
offered
a
tribute
in
a
kingly
fashion
captain
jim
was
a
old
man
with
eternal
youth
in
his
eyes
and
heart
he
had
a
tall
rather
ungainly
figure
somewhat
stooped
yet
suggestive
of
great
strength
and
endurance
a
face
deeply
lined
and
bronzed
a
thick
mane
of
hair
falling
quite
to
his
shoulders
and
a
pair
of
remarkably
blue
eyes
which
sometimes
twinkled
and
sometimes
dreamed
and
sometimes
looked
out
seaward
with
a
wistful
quest
in
them
as
of
one
seeking
something
precious
and
lost
anne
was
to
learn
one
day
what
it
was
for
which
captain
jim
looked
it
could
not
be
denied
that
captain
jim
was
a
homely
man
his
spare
jaws
rugged
mouth
and
square
brow
were
not
fashioned
on
the
lines
of
beauty
and
he
had
passed
through
many
hardships
and
sorrows
which
had
marked
his
body
as
well
as
his
soul
but
though
at
first
sight
anne
thought
him
plain
she
never
thought
anything
more
about
it
the
spirit
shining
through
that
rugged
tenement
beautified
it
so
wholly
they
gathered
gaily
around
the
supper
table
the
hearth
fire
banished
the
chill
of
the
september
evening
but
the
window
of
the
dining
room
was
open
and
sea
breezes
entered
at
their
own
sweet
will
the
view
was
magnificent
taking
in
the
harbor
and
the
sweep
of
low
purple
hills
beyond
the
table
was
heaped
with
mrs
doctor
delicacies
but
the
piece
de
resistance
was
undoubtedly
the
big
platter
of
sea
trout
thought
they
be
sorter
tasty
after
travelling
said
captain
jim
they
fresh
as
trout
can
be
mistress
blythe
two
hours
ago
they
were
swimming
in
the
glen
pond
who
is
attending
to
the
light
tonight
captain
jim
asked
doctor
dave
nephew
alec
he
understands
it
as
well
as
i
do
well
now
i
real
glad
you
asked
me
to
stay
to
supper
i
proper
hungry
did
have
much
of
a
dinner
today
i
believe
you
half
starve
yourself
most
of
the
time
down
at
that
light
said
mrs
doctor
dave
severely
you
wo
take
the
trouble
to
get
up
a
decent
meal
oh
i
do
mistress
doctor
i
do
protested
captain
jim
why
i
live
like
a
king
last
night
i
was
up
to
the
glen
and
took
home
two
pounds
of
steak
i
meant
to
have
a
spanking
good
dinner
today
and
what
happened
to
the
steak
asked
mrs
doctor
dave
did
you
lose
it
on
the
way
home
no
captain
jim
looked
sheepish
just
at
bedtime
a
poor
ornery
sort
of
dog
came
along
and
asked
for
a
night
lodging
guess
he
belonged
to
some
of
the
fishermen
shore
i
could
turn
the
poor
cur
out
he
had
a
sore
foot
so
i
shut
him
in
the
porch
with
an
old
bag
to
lie
on
and
went
to
bed
but
somehow
i
could
sleep
come
to
think
it
over
i
sorter
remembered
that
the
dog
looked
hungry
and
you
got
up
and
gave
him
that
steak
all
that
steak
said
mrs
doctor
dave
with
a
kind
of
triumphant
reproof
well
there
was
anything
else
to
give
him
said
captain
jim
deprecatingly
nothing
a
dog
care
for
that
is
i
reckon
he
was
hungry
for
he
made
about
two
bites
of
it
i
had
a
fine
sleep
the
rest
of
the
night
but
my
dinner
had
to
be
sorter
scanty
potatoes
and
point
as
you
might
say
the
dog
he
lit
out
for
home
this
morning
i
reckon
he
were
a
vegetarian
the
idea
of
starving
yourself
for
a
worthless
dog
sniffed
mrs
doctor
you
do
know
but
he
may
be
worth
a
lot
to
somebody
protested
captain
jim
he
did
look
of
much
account
but
you
ca
go
by
looks
in
jedging
a
dog
like
meself
he
might
be
a
real
beauty
inside
the
first
mate
did
approve
of
him
i
allow
his
language
was
right
down
forcible
but
the
first
mate
is
prejudiced
no
use
in
taking
a
cat
opinion
of
a
dog
i
lost
my
dinner
so
this
nice
spread
in
this
company
is
real
pleasant
it
a
great
thing
to
have
good
neighbors
who
lives
in
the
house
among
the
willows
up
the
brook
asked
anne
dick
moore
said
captain
jim
and
her
husband
he
added
as
if
by
way
of
an
afterthought
anne
smiled
and
deduced
a
mental
picture
of
dick
moore
from
captain
jim
way
of
putting
it
evidently
a
second
rachel
lynde
you
have
many
neighbors
mistress
blythe
captain
jim
went
on
this
side
of
the
harbor
is
mighty
thinly
settled
most
of
the
land
belongs
to
howard
up
yander
past
the
glen
and
he
rents
it
out
for
pasture
the
other
side
of
the
harbor
now
is
thick
with
folks
macallisters
there
a
whole
colony
of
macallisters
you
ca
throw
a
stone
but
you
hit
one
i
was
talking
to
old
leon
blacquiere
the
other
day
he
been
working
on
the
harbor
all
summer
nearly
all
macallisters
over
thar
he
told
me
neil
macallister
and
sandy
macallister
and
william
macallister
and
alec
macallister
and
angus
macallister
and
i
believe
dare
de
devil
macallister
there
are
nearly
as
many
elliotts
and
crawfords
said
doctor
dave
after
the
laughter
had
subsided
you
know
gilbert
we
folk
on
this
side
of
four
winds
have
an
old
saying
the
conceit
of
the
elliotts
the
pride
of
the
macallisters
and
the
vainglory
of
the
crawfords
good
lord
deliver
us
there
a
plenty
of
fine
people
among
them
though
said
captain
jim
i
sailed
with
william
crawford
for
many
a
year
and
for
courage
and
endurance
and
truth
that
man
had
an
equal
they
got
brains
over
on
that
side
of
four
winds
mebbe
that
why
this
side
is
sorter
inclined
to
pick
on
strange
ai
it
how
folks
seem
to
resent
anyone
being
born
a
mite
cleverer
than
they
be
doctor
dave
who
had
a
forty
years
feud
with
the
people
laughed
and
subsided
who
lives
in
that
brilliant
emerald
house
about
half
a
mile
up
the
road
asked
gilbert
captain
jim
smiled
delightedly
miss
cornelia
bryant
she
likely
be
over
to
see
you
soon
seeing
you
presbyterians
if
you
were
methodists
she
would
come
at
all
cornelia
has
a
holy
horror
of
methodists
she
quite
a
character
chuckled
doctor
dave
a
most
inveterate
sour
grapes
queried
gilbert
laughing
no
is
sour
grapes
answered
captain
jim
seriously
cornelia
could
have
had
her
pick
when
she
was
young
even
yet
she
only
to
say
the
word
to
see
the
old
widowers
jump
she
jest
seems
to
have
been
born
with
a
sort
of
chronic
spite
agin
men
and
methodists
she
got
the
bitterest
tongue
and
the
kindest
heart
in
four
winds
wherever
there
any
trouble
that
woman
is
there
doing
everything
to
help
in
the
tenderest
way
she
never
says
a
harsh
word
about
another
woman
and
if
she
likes
to
card
us
poor
scalawags
of
men
down
i
reckon
our
tough
old
hides
can
stand
it
she
always
speaks
well
of
you
captain
jim
said
mrs
doctor
yes
i
afraid
so
i
do
half
like
it
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
there
must
be
something
sorter
unnateral
about
me
chapter
the
schoolmaster
bride
who
was
the
first
bride
who
came
to
this
house
captain
jim
anne
asked
as
they
sat
around
the
fireplace
after
supper
was
she
a
part
of
the
story
i
heard
was
connected
with
this
house
asked
gilbert
somebody
told
me
you
could
tell
it
captain
jim
well
yes
i
know
it
i
reckon
i
the
only
person
living
in
four
winds
now
that
can
remember
the
schoolmaster
bride
as
she
was
when
she
come
to
the
island
she
been
dead
this
thirty
year
but
she
was
one
of
them
women
you
never
forget
tell
us
the
story
pleaded
anne
i
want
to
find
out
all
about
the
women
who
have
lived
in
this
house
before
me
well
there
jest
been
three
elizabeth
russell
and
ned
russell
and
the
schoolmaster
bride
elizabeth
russell
was
a
nice
clever
little
critter
and
ned
was
a
nice
woman
too
but
they
were
ever
like
the
schoolmaster
bride
the
schoolmaster
name
was
john
selwyn
he
came
out
from
the
old
country
to
teach
school
at
the
glen
when
i
was
a
boy
of
sixteen
he
was
much
like
the
usual
run
of
derelicts
who
used
to
come
out
to
to
teach
school
in
them
days
most
of
them
were
clever
drunken
critters
who
taught
the
children
the
three
r
when
they
were
sober
and
lambasted
them
when
they
was
but
john
selwyn
was
a
fine
handsome
young
fellow
he
boarded
at
my
father
and
he
and
me
were
cronies
though
he
was
ten
years
me
we
read
and
walked
and
talked
a
heap
together
he
knew
about
all
the
poetry
that
was
ever
written
i
reckon
and
he
used
to
quote
it
to
me
along
shore
in
the
evenings
dad
thought
it
an
awful
waste
of
time
but
he
sorter
endured
it
hoping
it
put
me
off
the
notion
of
going
to
sea
well
nothing
could
do
that
mother
come
of
a
race
of
folk
and
it
was
born
in
me
but
i
loved
to
hear
john
read
and
recite
it
almost
sixty
years
ago
but
i
could
repeat
yards
of
poetry
i
learned
from
him
nearly
sixty
years
captain
jim
was
silent
for
a
space
gazing
into
the
glowing
fire
in
a
quest
of
the
bygones
then
with
a
sigh
he
resumed
his
story
i
remember
one
spring
evening
i
met
him
on
the
he
looked
sorter
uplifted
jest
like
you
did
blythe
when
you
brought
mistress
blythe
in
tonight
i
thought
of
him
the
minute
i
seen
you
and
he
told
me
that
he
had
a
sweetheart
back
home
and
that
she
was
coming
out
to
him
i
was
half
pleased
ornery
young
lump
of
selfishness
that
i
was
i
thought
he
would
be
as
much
my
friend
after
she
came
but
i
enough
decency
not
to
let
him
see
it
he
told
me
all
about
her
her
name
was
persis
leigh
and
she
would
have
come
out
with
him
if
it
had
been
for
her
old
uncle
he
was
sick
and
he
looked
after
her
when
her
parents
died
and
she
would
leave
him
and
now
he
was
dead
and
she
was
coming
out
to
marry
john
selwyn
was
no
easy
journey
for
a
woman
in
them
days
there
were
no
steamers
you
must
ricollect
do
you
expect
her
says
i
sails
on
the
royal
william
the
of
june
says
he
so
she
should
be
here
by
i
must
set
carpenter
johnson
to
building
me
a
home
for
her
her
letter
come
today
i
know
before
i
opened
it
that
it
had
good
news
for
me
i
saw
her
a
few
nights
ago
i
did
understand
him
and
then
he
explained
though
i
understand
that
much
better
he
said
he
had
a
gift
or
a
curse
them
was
his
words
mistress
blythe
a
gift
or
a
curse
he
did
know
which
it
was
he
said
a
of
his
had
had
it
and
they
burned
her
for
a
witch
on
account
of
it
he
said
queer
spells
trances
i
think
was
the
name
he
give
come
over
him
now
and
again
are
there
such
things
doctor
there
are
people
who
are
certainly
subject
to
trances
answered
gilbert
the
matter
is
more
in
the
line
of
psychical
research
than
medical
what
were
the
trances
of
this
john
selwyn
like
like
dreams
said
the
old
doctor
skeptically
he
said
he
could
see
things
in
them
said
captain
jim
slowly
mind
you
i
telling
you
jest
what
he
said
things
that
were
happening
things
that
were
going
to
happen
he
said
they
were
sometimes
a
comfort
to
him
and
sometimes
a
horror
four
nights
before
this
he
been
in
one
went
into
it
while
he
was
sitting
looking
at
the
fire
and
he
saw
an
old
room
he
knew
well
in
england
and
persis
leigh
in
it
holding
out
her
hands
to
him
and
looking
glad
and
happy
so
he
knew
he
was
going
to
hear
good
news
of
her
a
dream
a
dream
scoffed
the
old
doctor
likely
likely
conceded
captain
jim
that
what
said
to
him
at
the
time
it
was
a
vast
more
comfortable
to
think
so
i
like
the
idea
of
him
seeing
things
like
that
it
was
real
uncanny
says
he
did
dream
it
but
we
wo
talk
of
this
again
you
wo
be
so
much
my
friend
if
you
think
much
about
it
i
told
him
nothing
could
make
me
any
less
his
friend
but
he
jest
shook
his
head
and
says
says
he
i
know
i
lost
friends
before
because
of
this
i
blame
them
there
are
times
when
i
feel
hardly
friendly
to
myself
because
of
it
such
a
power
has
a
bit
of
divinity
in
it
whether
of
a
good
or
an
evil
divinity
who
shall
say
and
we
mortals
all
shrink
from
too
close
contact
with
god
or
devil
them
was
his
words
i
remember
them
as
if
was
yesterday
though
i
did
know
jest
what
he
meant
what
do
you
he
did
mean
doctor
i
doubt
if
he
knew
what
he
meant
himself
said
doctor
dave
testily
i
think
i
understand
whispered
anne
she
was
listening
in
her
old
attitude
of
clasped
lips
and
shining
eyes
captain
jim
treated
himself
to
an
admiring
smile
before
he
went
on
with
his
story
well
purty
soon
all
the
glen
and
four
winds
people
knew
the
schoolmaster
bride
was
coming
and
they
were
all
glad
because
they
thought
so
much
of
him
and
everybody
took
an
interest
in
his
new
house
this
house
he
picked
this
site
for
it
because
you
could
see
the
harbor
and
hear
the
sea
from
it
he
made
the
garden
out
there
for
his
bride
but
he
did
plant
the
lombardies
ned
russell
planted
them
but
there
a
double
row
of
in
the
garden
that
the
little
girls
who
went
to
the
glen
school
set
out
there
for
the
schoolmaster
bride
he
said
they
were
pink
for
her
cheeks
and
white
for
her
brow
and
red
for
her
lips
he
quoted
poetry
so
much
that
he
sorter
got
into
the
habit
of
talking
it
too
i
reckon
almost
everybody
sent
him
some
little
present
to
help
out
the
furnishing
of
the
house
when
the
russells
came
into
it
they
were
and
furnished
it
real
handsome
as
you
can
see
but
the
first
furniture
that
went
into
it
was
plain
enough
this
little
house
was
rich
in
love
though
the
women
sent
in
quilts
and
tablecloths
and
towels
and
one
man
made
a
chest
for
her
and
another
a
table
and
so
on
even
blind
old
aunt
margaret
boyd
wove
a
little
basket
for
her
out
of
the
grass
the
schoolmaster
wife
used
it
for
years
to
keep
her
handkerchiefs
in
well
at
last
everything
was
ready
even
to
the
logs
in
the
big
fireplace
ready
for
lighting
was
exactly
this
fireplace
though
in
the
same
place
miss
elizabeth
had
this
put
in
when
she
made
the
house
over
fifteen
years
ago
it
was
a
big
fireplace
where
you
could
have
roasted
an
ox
many
the
time
i
sat
here
and
spun
yarns
same
i
doing
tonight
again
there
was
a
silence
while
captain
jim
kept
a
passing
tryst
with
visitants
anne
and
gilbert
could
not
see
the
folks
who
had
sat
with
him
around
that
fireplace
in
the
vanished
years
with
mirth
and
bridal
joy
shining
in
eyes
long
since
closed
forever
under
churchyard
sod
or
heaving
leagues
of
sea
here
on
olden
nights
children
had
tossed
laughter
lightly
to
and
fro
here
on
winter
evenings
friends
had
gathered
dance
and
music
and
jest
had
been
here
here
youths
and
maidens
had
dreamed
for
captain
jim
the
little
house
was
tenanted
with
shapes
entreating
remembrance
it
was
the
first
of
july
when
the
house
was
finished
the
schoolmaster
began
to
count
the
days
then
we
used
to
see
him
walking
along
the
shore
and
we
say
to
each
other
soon
be
with
him
now
she
was
expected
the
middle
of
july
but
she
did
come
then
nobody
felt
anxious
vessels
were
often
delayed
for
days
and
mebbe
weeks
the
royal
william
was
a
week
overdue
and
then
two
and
then
three
and
at
last
we
began
to
be
frightened
and
it
got
worse
and
worse
i
could
bear
to
look
into
john
selwyn
eyes
d
know
mistress
blythe
captain
jim
lowered
his
voice
i
used
to
think
that
they
looked
just
like
what
his
old
must
have
been
when
they
were
burning
her
to
death
he
never
said
much
but
he
taught
school
like
a
man
in
a
dream
and
then
hurried
to
the
shore
many
a
night
he
walked
there
from
dark
to
dawn
people
said
he
was
losing
his
mind
everybody
had
given
up
hope
the
royal
william
was
eight
weeks
overdue
it
was
the
middle
of
september
and
the
schoolmaster
bride
had
come
never
would
come
we
thought
there
was
a
big
storm
then
that
lasted
three
days
and
on
the
evening
after
it
died
away
i
went
to
the
shore
i
found
the
schoolmaster
there
leaning
with
his
arms
folded
against
a
big
rock
gazing
out
to
sea
i
spoke
to
him
but
he
did
answer
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
looking
at
something
i
could
see
his
face
was
set
like
a
dead
man
john
i
called
out
jest
like
that
jest
like
a
frightened
child
up
wake
up
that
strange
awful
look
seemed
to
sorter
fade
out
of
his
eyes
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
me
i
never
forgot
his
face
never
will
forget
it
till
i
ships
for
my
last
voyage
is
well
lad
he
says
seen
the
royal
william
coming
around
east
point
she
will
be
here
by
dawn
tomorrow
night
i
shall
sit
with
my
bride
by
my
own
do
you
think
he
did
see
it
demanded
captain
jim
abruptly
god
knows
said
gilbert
softly
great
love
and
great
pain
might
compass
we
know
not
what
marvels
i
am
sure
he
did
see
it
said
anne
earnestly
said
doctor
dave
but
he
spoke
with
less
conviction
than
usual
because
you
know
said
captain
jim
solemnly
the
royal
william
came
into
four
winds
harbor
at
daylight
the
next
morning
every
soul
in
the
glen
and
along
the
shore
was
at
the
old
wharf
to
meet
her
the
schoolmaster
had
been
watching
there
all
night
how
we
cheered
as
she
sailed
up
the
channel
captain
jim
eyes
were
shining
they
were
looking
at
the
four
winds
harbor
of
sixty
years
agone
with
a
battered
old
ship
sailing
through
the
sunrise
splendor
and
persis
leigh
was
on
board
asked
anne
yes
her
and
the
captain
wife
they
had
an
awful
passage
storm
after
storm
and
their
provisions
give
out
too
but
there
they
were
at
last
when
persis
leigh
stepped
onto
the
old
wharf
john
selwyn
took
her
in
his
arms
and
folks
stopped
cheering
and
begun
to
cry
i
cried
myself
though
was
years
mind
you
afore
i
admit
it
ai
it
funny
how
ashamed
boys
are
of
tears
was
persis
leigh
beautiful
asked
anne
well
i
do
know
that
you
call
her
beautiful
exactly
i
do
know
said
captain
jim
slowly
somehow
you
never
got
so
far
along
as
to
wonder
if
she
was
handsome
or
not
it
jest
did
matter
there
was
something
so
sweet
and
winsome
about
her
that
you
had
to
love
her
that
was
all
but
she
was
pleasant
to
look
at
big
clear
hazel
eyes
and
heaps
of
glossy
brown
hair
and
an
english
skin
john
and
her
were
married
at
our
house
that
night
at
early
everybody
from
far
and
near
was
there
to
see
it
and
we
all
brought
them
down
here
afterwards
mistress
selwyn
lighted
the
fire
and
we
went
away
and
left
them
sitting
here
jest
as
john
had
seen
in
that
vision
of
his
a
strange
thing
a
strange
thing
but
i
seen
a
turrible
lot
of
strange
things
in
my
time
captain
jim
shook
his
head
sagely
it
a
dear
story
said
anne
feeling
that
for
once
she
had
got
enough
romance
to
satisfy
her
how
long
did
they
live
here
fifteen
years
i
ran
off
to
sea
soon
after
they
were
married
like
the
young
scalawag
i
was
but
every
time
i
come
back
from
a
voyage
head
for
here
even
before
i
went
home
and
tell
mistress
selwyn
all
about
it
fifteen
happy
years
they
had
a
sort
of
talent
for
happiness
them
two
some
folks
are
like
that
if
you
noticed
they
could
be
unhappy
for
long
no
matter
what
happened
they
quarrelled
once
or
twice
for
they
was
both
but
mistress
selwyn
says
to
me
once
says
she
laughing
in
that
pretty
way
of
hers
felt
dreadful
when
john
and
i
quarrelled
but
underneath
it
all
i
was
very
happy
because
i
had
such
a
nice
husband
to
quarrel
with
and
make
it
up
with
then
they
moved
to
charlottetown
and
ned
russell
bought
this
house
and
brought
his
bride
here
they
were
a
gay
young
pair
as
i
remember
them
miss
elizabeth
russell
was
sister
she
came
to
live
with
them
a
year
or
so
later
and
she
was
a
creature
of
mirth
too
the
walls
of
this
house
must
be
sorter
soaked
with
laughing
and
good
times
you
the
third
bride
i
seen
come
here
mistress
blythe
and
the
handsomest
captain
jim
contrived
to
give
his
sunflower
compliment
the
delicacy
of
a
violet
and
anne
wore
it
proudly
she
was
looking
her
best
that
night
with
the
bridal
rose
on
her
cheeks
and
the
in
her
eyes
even
gruff
old
doctor
dave
gave
her
an
approving
glance
and
told
his
wife
as
they
drove
home
together
that
that
wife
of
the
boy
was
something
of
a
beauty
i
must
be
getting
back
to
the
light
announced
captain
jim
this
evening
something
tremenjus
you
must
come
often
to
see
us
said
anne
i
wonder
if
you
give
that
invitation
if
you
knew
how
likely
i
be
to
accept
it
captain
jim
remarked
whimsically
which
is
another
way
of
saying
you
wonder
if
i
mean
it
smiled
anne
i
do
my
heart
as
we
used
to
say
at
school
then
i
come
you
likely
to
be
pestered
with
me
at
any
hour
and
i
be
proud
to
have
you
drop
down
and
visit
me
now
and
then
too
i
have
anyone
to
talk
to
but
the
first
mate
bless
his
sociable
heart
he
a
mighty
good
listener
and
has
forgot
any
macallister
of
them
all
ever
knew
but
he
is
much
of
a
conversationalist
you
young
and
i
old
but
our
souls
are
about
the
same
age
i
reckon
we
both
belong
to
the
race
that
knows
joseph
as
cornelia
bryant
would
say
the
race
that
knows
joseph
puzzled
anne
yes
cornelia
divides
all
the
folks
in
the
world
into
two
kinds
the
race
that
knows
joseph
and
the
race
that
do
if
a
person
sorter
sees
eye
to
eye
with
you
and
has
pretty
much
the
same
ideas
about
things
and
the
same
taste
in
jokes
why
then
he
belongs
to
the
race
that
knows
joseph
oh
i
understand
exclaimed
anne
light
breaking
in
upon
her
it
what
i
used
to
call
and
still
call
in
quotation
marks
spirits
jest
so
jest
so
agreed
captain
jim
we
it
whatever
it
is
when
you
come
in
tonight
mistress
blythe
i
says
to
myself
says
i
she
of
the
race
that
knows
joseph
and
mighty
glad
i
was
for
if
it
was
so
we
could
have
had
any
real
satisfaction
in
each
other
company
the
race
that
knows
joseph
is
the
salt
of
the
airth
i
reckon
the
moon
had
just
risen
when
anne
and
gilbert
went
to
the
door
with
their
guests
four
winds
harbor
was
beginning
to
be
a
thing
of
dream
and
glamour
and
enchantment
a
spellbound
haven
where
no
tempest
might
ever
ravin
the
lombardies
down
the
lane
tall
and
sombre
as
the
priestly
forms
of
some
mystic
band
were
tipped
with
silver
always
liked
lombardies
said
captain
jim
waving
a
long
arm
at
them
they
the
trees
of
princesses
they
out
of
fashion
now
folks
complain
that
they
die
at
the
top
and
get
so
they
do
so
they
do
if
you
do
risk
your
neck
every
spring
climbing
up
a
light
ladder
to
trim
them
out
i
always
did
it
for
miss
elizabeth
so
her
lombardies
never
got
she
was
especially
fond
of
them
she
liked
their
dignity
and
they
do
hobnob
with
every
tom
dick
and
harry
if
it
maples
for
company
mistress
blythe
it
lombardies
for
society
what
a
beautiful
night
said
mrs
doctor
dave
as
she
climbed
into
the
doctor
buggy
most
nights
are
beautiful
said
captain
jim
but
i
that
moonlight
over
four
winds
makes
me
sorter
wonder
what
left
for
heaven
the
moon
a
great
friend
of
mine
mistress
blythe
loved
her
ever
since
i
can
remember
when
i
was
a
little
chap
of
eight
i
fell
asleep
in
the
garden
one
evening
and
was
missed
i
woke
up
along
in
the
night
and
i
was
most
scared
to
death
what
shadows
and
queer
noises
there
was
i
durs
move
jest
crouched
there
quaking
poor
small
mite
seemed
if
there
were
anyone
in
the
world
but
meself
and
it
was
mighty
big
then
all
at
once
i
saw
the
moon
looking
down
at
me
through
the
apple
boughs
jest
like
an
old
friend
i
was
comforted
right
off
got
up
and
walked
to
the
house
as
brave
as
a
lion
looking
at
her
many
the
night
i
watched
her
from
the
deck
of
my
vessel
on
seas
far
away
from
here
why
do
you
folks
tell
me
to
take
in
the
slack
of
my
jaw
and
go
home
the
laughter
of
the
goodnights
died
away
anne
and
gilbert
walked
hand
in
hand
around
their
garden
the
brook
that
ran
across
the
corner
dimpled
pellucidly
in
the
shadows
of
the
birches
the
poppies
along
its
banks
were
like
shallow
cups
of
moonlight
flowers
that
had
been
planted
by
the
hands
of
the
schoolmaster
bride
flung
their
sweetness
on
the
shadowy
air
like
the
beauty
and
blessing
of
sacred
yesterdays
anne
paused
in
the
gloom
to
gather
a
spray
i
love
to
smell
flowers
in
the
dark
she
said
you
get
hold
of
their
soul
then
oh
gilbert
this
little
house
is
all
i
dreamed
it
and
i
so
glad
that
we
are
not
the
first
who
have
kept
bridal
tryst
here
chapter
miss
cornelia
bryant
comes
to
call
that
september
was
a
month
of
golden
mists
and
purple
hazes
at
four
winds
harbor
a
month
of
days
and
of
nights
that
were
swimming
in
moonlight
or
pulsating
with
stars
no
storm
marred
it
no
rough
wind
blew
anne
and
gilbert
put
their
nest
in
order
rambled
on
the
shores
sailed
on
the
harbor
drove
about
four
winds
and
the
glen
or
through
the
ferny
sequestered
roads
of
the
woods
around
the
harbor
head
in
short
had
such
a
honeymoon
as
any
lovers
in
the
world
might
have
envied
them
if
life
were
to
stop
short
just
now
it
would
still
have
been
richly
worth
while
just
for
the
sake
of
these
past
four
weeks
would
it
said
anne
i
do
suppose
we
will
ever
have
four
such
perfect
weeks
again
but
we
had
them
everything
wind
weather
folks
house
of
dreams
has
conspired
to
make
our
honeymoon
delightful
there
even
been
a
rainy
day
since
we
came
here
and
we
have
quarrelled
once
teased
gilbert
well
a
pleasure
all
the
greater
for
being
deferred
quoted
anne
i
so
glad
we
decided
to
spend
our
honeymoon
here
our
memories
of
it
will
always
belong
here
in
our
house
of
dreams
instead
of
being
scattered
about
in
strange
places
there
was
a
certain
tang
of
romance
and
adventure
in
the
atmosphere
of
their
new
home
which
anne
had
never
found
in
avonlea
there
although
she
had
lived
in
sight
of
the
sea
it
had
not
entered
intimately
into
her
life
in
four
winds
it
surrounded
her
and
called
to
her
constantly
from
every
window
of
her
new
home
she
saw
some
varying
aspect
of
it
its
haunting
murmur
was
ever
in
her
ears
vessels
sailed
up
the
harbor
every
day
to
the
wharf
at
the
glen
or
sailed
out
again
through
the
sunset
bound
for
ports
that
might
be
half
way
round
the
globe
fishing
boats
went
down
the
channel
in
the
mornings
and
returned
laden
in
the
evenings
sailors
and
travelled
the
red
winding
harbor
roads
and
content
there
was
always
a
certain
sense
of
things
going
to
happen
of
adventures
and
the
ways
of
four
winds
were
less
staid
and
settled
and
grooved
than
those
of
avonlea
winds
of
change
blew
over
them
the
sea
called
ever
to
the
dwellers
on
shore
and
even
those
who
might
not
answer
its
call
felt
the
thrill
and
unrest
and
mystery
and
possibilities
of
it
i
understand
now
why
some
men
must
go
to
sea
said
anne
that
desire
which
comes
to
us
all
at
times
sail
beyond
the
bourne
of
sunset
must
be
very
imperious
when
it
is
born
in
you
i
do
wonder
captain
jim
ran
away
because
of
it
i
never
see
a
ship
sailing
out
of
the
channel
or
a
gull
soaring
over
the
without
wishing
i
were
on
board
the
ship
or
had
wings
not
like
a
dove
fly
away
and
be
at
rest
but
like
a
gull
to
sweep
out
into
the
very
heart
of
a
storm
you
stay
right
here
with
me
said
gilbert
lazily
i
wo
have
you
flying
away
from
me
into
the
hearts
of
storms
they
were
sitting
on
their
red
doorstep
in
the
late
afternoon
great
tranquillities
were
all
about
them
in
land
and
sea
and
sky
silvery
gulls
were
soaring
over
them
the
horizons
were
laced
with
long
trails
of
frail
pinkish
clouds
the
hushed
air
was
threaded
with
a
murmurous
refrain
of
minstrel
winds
and
waves
pale
asters
were
blowing
in
the
sere
and
misty
meadows
between
them
and
the
harbor
doctors
who
have
to
be
up
all
night
waiting
on
sick
folk
do
feel
very
adventurous
i
suppose
anne
said
indulgently
if
you
had
had
a
good
sleep
last
night
gilbert
you
be
as
ready
as
i
am
for
a
flight
of
imagination
i
did
good
work
last
night
anne
said
gilbert
quietly
under
god
i
saved
a
life
this
is
the
first
time
i
could
ever
really
claim
that
in
other
cases
i
may
have
helped
but
anne
if
i
had
not
stayed
at
allonby
last
night
and
fought
death
hand
to
hand
that
woman
would
have
died
before
morning
i
tried
an
experiment
that
was
certainly
never
tried
in
four
winds
before
i
doubt
if
it
was
ever
tried
anywhere
before
outside
of
a
hospital
it
was
a
new
thing
in
kingsport
hospital
last
winter
i
could
never
have
dared
try
it
here
if
i
had
not
been
absolutely
certain
that
there
was
no
other
chance
i
risked
it
and
it
succeeded
as
a
result
a
good
wife
and
mother
is
saved
for
long
years
of
happiness
and
usefulness
as
i
drove
home
this
morning
while
the
sun
was
rising
over
the
harbor
i
thanked
god
that
i
had
chosen
the
profession
i
did
i
had
fought
a
good
fight
and
won
think
of
it
anne
won
against
the
great
destroyer
it
what
i
dreamed
of
doing
long
ago
when
we
talked
together
of
what
we
wanted
to
do
in
life
that
dream
of
mine
came
true
this
morning
was
that
the
only
one
of
your
dreams
that
has
come
true
asked
anne
who
knew
perfectly
well
what
the
substance
of
his
answer
would
be
but
wanted
to
hear
it
again
you
know
said
gilbert
smiling
into
her
eyes
at
that
moment
there
were
certainly
two
perfectly
happy
people
sitting
on
the
doorstep
of
a
little
white
house
on
the
four
winds
harbor
shore
presently
gilbert
said
with
a
change
of
tone
do
i
or
do
i
not
see
a
ship
sailing
up
our
lane
anne
looked
and
sprang
up
that
must
be
either
miss
cornelia
bryant
or
moore
coming
to
call
she
said
i
going
into
the
office
and
if
it
is
miss
cornelia
i
warn
you
that
i
eavesdrop
said
gilbert
from
all
i
heard
regarding
miss
cornelia
i
conclude
that
her
conversation
will
not
be
dull
to
say
the
least
it
may
be
mrs
moore
i
do
think
moore
is
built
on
those
lines
i
saw
her
working
in
her
garden
the
other
day
and
though
i
was
too
far
away
to
see
clearly
i
thought
she
was
rather
slender
she
does
seem
very
socially
inclined
when
she
has
never
called
on
you
yet
although
your
nearest
neighbor
she
ca
be
like
lynde
after
all
or
curiosity
would
have
brought
her
said
anne
this
caller
is
i
think
miss
cornelia
miss
cornelia
it
was
moreover
miss
cornelia
had
not
come
to
make
any
brief
and
fashionable
wedding
call
she
had
her
work
under
her
arm
in
a
substantial
parcel
and
when
anne
asked
her
to
stay
she
promptly
took
off
her
capacious
which
had
been
held
on
her
head
despite
irreverent
september
breezes
by
a
tight
elastic
band
under
her
hard
little
knob
of
fair
hair
no
hat
pins
for
miss
cornelia
an
it
please
ye
elastic
bands
had
been
good
enough
for
her
mother
and
they
were
good
enough
for
her
she
had
a
fresh
round
face
and
jolly
brown
eyes
she
did
not
look
in
the
least
like
the
traditional
old
maid
and
there
was
something
in
her
expression
which
won
anne
instantly
with
her
old
instinctive
quickness
to
discern
kindred
spirits
she
knew
she
was
going
to
like
miss
cornelia
in
spite
of
uncertain
oddities
of
opinion
and
certain
oddities
of
attire
nobody
but
miss
cornelia
would
have
come
to
make
a
call
arrayed
in
a
striped
apron
and
a
wrapper
of
chocolate
print
with
a
design
of
huge
pink
roses
scattered
over
it
and
nobody
but
miss
cornelia
could
have
looked
dignified
and
suitably
garbed
in
it
had
miss
cornelia
been
entering
a
palace
to
call
on
a
prince
bride
she
would
have
been
just
as
dignified
and
just
as
wholly
mistress
of
the
situation
she
would
have
trailed
her
flounce
over
the
marble
floors
just
as
unconcernedly
and
she
would
have
proceeded
just
as
calmly
to
disabuse
the
mind
of
the
princess
of
any
idea
that
the
possession
of
a
mere
man
be
he
prince
or
peasant
was
anything
to
brag
of
i
brought
my
work
blythe
dearie
she
remarked
unrolling
some
dainty
material
i
in
a
hurry
to
get
this
done
and
there
is
any
time
to
lose
anne
looked
in
some
surprise
at
the
white
garment
spread
over
miss
cornelia
ample
lap
it
was
certainly
a
baby
dress
and
it
was
most
beautifully
made
with
tiny
frills
and
tucks
miss
cornelia
adjusted
her
glasses
and
fell
to
embroidering
with
exquisite
stitches
this
is
for
fred
proctor
up
at
the
glen
she
announced
expecting
her
eighth
baby
any
day
now
and
not
a
stitch
has
she
ready
for
it
the
other
seven
have
wore
out
all
she
made
for
the
first
and
she
never
had
time
or
strength
or
spirit
to
make
any
more
that
woman
is
a
martyr
blythe
believe
me
when
she
married
fred
proctor
knew
how
it
would
turn
out
he
was
one
of
your
wicked
fascinating
men
after
he
got
married
he
left
off
being
fascinating
and
just
kept
on
being
wicked
he
drinks
and
he
neglects
his
family
is
that
like
a
man
i
do
know
how
proctor
would
ever
keep
her
children
decently
clothed
if
her
neighbors
did
help
her
out
as
anne
was
afterwards
to
learn
miss
cornelia
was
the
only
neighbor
who
troubled
herself
much
about
the
decency
of
the
young
proctors
when
i
heard
this
eighth
baby
was
coming
i
decided
to
make
some
things
for
it
miss
cornelia
went
on
this
is
the
last
and
i
want
to
finish
it
today
it
certainly
very
pretty
said
anne
i
get
my
sewing
and
have
a
little
thimble
party
of
two
you
are
a
beautiful
sewer
miss
bryant
yes
i
the
best
sewer
in
these
parts
said
miss
cornelia
in
a
tone
i
ought
to
be
lord
i
done
more
of
it
than
if
i
had
a
hundred
children
of
my
own
believe
me
i
i
a
fool
to
be
putting
hand
embroidery
on
this
dress
for
an
eighth
baby
but
lord
blythe
dearie
it
is
to
blame
for
being
the
eighth
and
i
kind
of
wished
it
to
have
one
real
pretty
dress
just
as
if
it
was
wanted
nobody
wanting
the
poor
mite
so
i
put
some
extra
fuss
on
its
little
things
just
on
that
account
any
baby
might
be
proud
of
that
dress
said
anne
feeling
still
more
strongly
that
she
was
going
to
like
miss
cornelia
i
you
been
thinking
i
was
never
coming
to
call
on
you
resumed
miss
cornelia
but
this
is
harvest
month
you
know
and
been
busy
and
a
lot
of
extra
hands
hanging
round
eating
they
work
just
like
the
men
i
have
come
yesterday
but
i
went
to
roderick
macallister
funeral
at
first
i
thought
my
head
was
aching
so
badly
i
could
enjoy
myself
if
i
did
go
but
she
was
a
hundred
years
old
and
i
always
promised
myself
that
i
go
to
her
funeral
was
it
a
successful
function
asked
anne
noticing
that
the
office
door
was
ajar
what
that
oh
yes
it
was
a
tremendous
funeral
she
had
a
very
large
connection
there
was
over
one
hundred
and
twenty
carriages
in
the
procession
there
was
one
or
two
funny
things
happened
i
thought
that
die
i
would
to
see
old
joe
bradshaw
who
is
an
infidel
and
never
darkens
the
door
of
a
church
singing
in
the
arms
of
jesus
with
great
gusto
and
fervor
he
glories
in
singing
that
why
he
never
misses
a
funeral
poor
bradshaw
did
look
much
like
singing
all
wore
out
slaving
old
joe
starts
out
once
in
a
while
to
buy
her
a
present
and
brings
home
some
new
kind
of
farm
machinery
is
that
like
a
man
but
what
else
would
you
expect
of
a
man
who
never
goes
to
church
even
a
methodist
one
i
was
real
thankful
to
see
you
and
the
young
doctor
in
the
presbyterian
church
your
first
sunday
no
doctor
for
me
who
is
a
presbyterian
we
were
in
the
methodist
church
last
sunday
evening
said
anne
wickedly
oh
i
blythe
has
to
go
to
the
methodist
church
once
in
a
while
or
he
would
get
the
methodist
practice
we
liked
the
sermon
very
much
declared
anne
boldly
and
i
thought
the
methodist
minster
prayer
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
i
ever
heard
oh
i
no
doubt
he
can
pray
i
never
heard
anyone
make
more
beautiful
prayers
than
old
simon
bentley
who
was
always
drunk
or
hoping
to
be
and
the
drunker
he
was
the
better
he
prayed
the
methodist
minister
is
very
fine
looking
said
anne
for
the
benefit
of
the
office
door
yes
he
quite
ornamental
agreed
miss
cornelia
oh
and
very
ladylike
and
he
thinks
that
every
girl
who
looks
at
him
falls
in
love
with
him
as
if
a
methodist
minister
wandering
about
like
any
jew
was
such
a
prize
if
you
and
the
young
doctor
take
my
advice
you
have
much
to
do
with
the
methodists
my
motto
is
if
you
are
a
presbyterian
be
a
presbyterian
do
you
think
that
methodists
go
to
heaven
as
well
as
presbyterians
asked
anne
smilelessly
that
is
for
us
to
decide
it
in
higher
hands
than
ours
said
miss
cornelia
solemnly
but
i
ai
going
to
associate
with
them
on
earth
whatever
i
may
have
to
do
in
heaven
this
methodist
minister
is
married
the
last
one
they
had
was
and
his
wife
was
the
silliest
flightiest
little
thing
i
ever
saw
i
told
her
husband
once
that
he
should
have
waited
till
she
was
grown
up
before
he
married
her
he
said
he
wanted
to
have
the
training
of
her
was
that
like
a
man
it
rather
hard
to
decide
just
when
people
are
grown
up
laughed
anne
that
a
true
word
dearie
some
are
grown
up
when
they
born
and
others
ai
grown
up
when
they
eighty
believe
me
that
same
roderick
i
was
speaking
of
never
grew
up
she
was
as
foolish
when
she
was
a
hundred
as
when
she
was
ten
perhaps
that
was
why
she
lived
so
long
suggested
anne
maybe
was
rather
live
fifty
sensible
years
than
a
hundred
foolish
ones
but
just
think
what
a
dull
world
it
would
be
if
everyone
was
sensible
pleaded
anne
miss
cornelia
disdained
any
skirmish
of
flippant
epigram
roderick
was
a
milgrave
and
the
milgraves
never
had
much
sense
her
nephew
ebenezer
milgrave
used
to
be
insane
for
years
he
believed
he
was
dead
and
used
to
rage
at
his
wife
because
she
bury
him
it
miss
cornelia
looked
so
grimly
determined
that
anne
could
almost
see
her
with
a
spade
in
her
hand
do
you
know
any
good
husbands
miss
bryant
oh
yes
lots
of
them
over
yonder
said
miss
cornelia
waving
her
hand
through
the
open
window
towards
the
little
graveyard
of
the
church
across
the
harbor
but
living
going
about
in
the
flesh
persisted
anne
oh
there
a
few
just
to
show
that
with
god
all
things
are
possible
acknowledged
miss
cornelia
reluctantly
i
do
deny
that
an
odd
man
here
and
there
if
he
caught
young
and
trained
up
proper
and
if
his
mother
has
spanked
him
well
beforehand
may
turn
out
a
decent
being
your
husband
now
is
so
bad
as
men
go
from
all
i
hear
i
miss
cornelia
looked
sharply
at
anne
over
her
glasses
you
think
there
nobody
like
him
in
the
world
there
is
said
anne
promptly
ah
well
i
heard
another
bride
say
that
once
sighed
miss
cornelia
jennie
dean
thought
when
she
married
that
there
was
anybody
like
her
husband
in
the
world
and
she
was
right
there
was
and
a
good
thing
too
believe
me
he
led
her
an
awful
life
and
he
was
courting
his
second
wife
while
jennie
was
dying
was
that
like
a
man
however
i
hope
your
confidence
will
be
better
justified
dearie
the
young
doctor
is
taking
real
well
i
was
afraid
at
first
he
might
for
folks
hereabouts
have
always
thought
old
doctor
dave
the
only
doctor
in
the
world
doctor
dave
had
much
tact
to
be
sure
he
was
always
talking
of
ropes
in
houses
where
someone
had
hanged
himself
but
folks
forgot
their
hurt
feelings
when
they
had
a
pain
in
their
stomachs
if
he
been
a
minister
instead
of
a
doctor
they
never
have
forgiven
him
does
worry
folks
near
as
much
as
seeing
as
we
both
presbyterians
and
no
methodists
around
will
you
tell
me
your
candid
opinion
of
our
minister
why
really
i
well
hesitated
anne
miss
cornelia
nodded
exactly
i
agree
with
you
dearie
we
made
a
mistake
when
we
called
him
his
face
just
looks
like
one
of
those
long
narrow
stones
in
the
graveyard
does
it
to
the
memory
ought
to
be
written
on
his
forehead
i
shall
never
forget
the
first
sermon
he
preached
after
he
came
it
was
on
the
subject
of
everyone
doing
what
they
were
best
fitted
for
a
very
good
subject
of
course
but
such
illustrations
as
he
used
he
said
you
had
a
cow
and
an
apple
tree
and
if
you
tied
the
apple
tree
in
your
stable
and
planted
the
cow
in
your
orchard
with
her
legs
up
how
much
milk
would
you
get
from
the
apple
tree
or
how
many
apples
from
the
cow
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
in
your
born
days
dearie
i
was
so
thankful
there
were
no
methodists
there
that
day
they
never
have
been
done
hooting
over
it
but
what
i
dislike
most
in
him
is
his
habit
of
agreeing
with
everybody
no
matter
what
is
said
if
you
said
to
him
a
scoundrel
he
say
with
that
smooth
smile
of
his
that
so
a
minister
should
have
more
backbone
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
i
consider
him
a
reverend
jackass
but
of
course
this
is
just
between
you
and
me
when
there
are
methodists
in
hearing
i
praise
him
to
the
skies
some
folks
think
his
wife
dresses
too
gay
but
say
when
she
has
to
live
with
a
face
like
that
she
needs
something
to
cheer
her
up
you
never
hear
me
condemning
a
woman
for
her
dress
i
only
too
thankful
when
her
husband
is
too
mean
and
miserly
to
allow
it
not
that
i
bother
much
with
dress
myself
women
just
dress
to
please
the
men
and
i
never
stoop
to
that
i
have
had
a
real
placid
comfortable
life
dearie
and
it
just
because
i
never
cared
a
cent
what
the
men
thought
why
do
you
hate
the
men
so
miss
bryant
lord
dearie
i
do
hate
them
they
are
worth
it
i
just
sort
of
despise
them
i
think
i
like
your
husband
if
he
keeps
on
as
he
has
begun
but
apart
from
him
about
the
only
men
in
the
world
much
use
for
are
the
old
doctor
and
captain
jim
captain
jim
is
certainly
splendid
agreed
anne
cordially
captain
jim
is
a
good
man
but
he
kind
of
vexing
in
one
way
you
ca
make
him
mad
i
tried
for
twenty
years
and
he
just
keeps
on
being
placid
it
does
sort
of
rile
me
and
i
the
woman
he
should
have
married
got
a
man
who
went
into
tantrums
twice
a
day
who
was
she
oh
i
do
know
dearie
i
never
remember
of
captain
jim
making
up
to
anybody
he
was
edging
on
old
as
far
as
my
memory
goes
you
know
i
never
heard
any
reason
for
his
staying
a
bachelor
but
there
must
be
one
believe
me
he
sailed
all
his
life
till
five
years
ago
and
there
no
corner
of
the
earth
he
has
poked
his
nose
into
he
and
elizabeth
russell
were
great
cronies
all
their
lives
but
they
never
had
any
notion
of
elizabeth
never
married
though
she
had
plenty
of
chances
she
was
a
great
beauty
when
she
was
young
the
year
the
prince
of
wales
came
to
the
island
she
was
visiting
her
uncle
in
charlottetown
and
he
was
a
government
official
and
so
she
got
invited
to
the
great
ball
she
was
the
prettiest
girl
there
and
the
prince
danced
with
her
and
all
the
other
women
he
did
dance
with
were
furious
about
it
because
their
social
standing
was
higher
than
hers
and
they
said
he
should
have
passed
them
over
elizabeth
was
always
very
proud
of
that
dance
mean
folks
said
that
was
why
she
never
married
she
could
put
up
with
an
ordinary
man
after
dancing
with
a
prince
but
that
was
so
she
told
me
the
reason
once
it
was
because
she
had
such
a
temper
that
she
was
afraid
she
could
live
peaceably
with
any
man
she
had
an
awful
temper
she
used
to
have
to
go
upstairs
and
bite
pieces
out
of
her
bureau
to
keep
it
down
by
times
but
i
told
her
that
was
any
reason
for
not
marrying
if
she
wanted
to
there
no
reason
why
we
should
let
the
men
have
a
monopoly
of
temper
is
there
blythe
dearie
i
a
bit
of
temper
myself
sighed
anne
it
well
you
have
dearie
you
wo
be
half
so
likely
to
be
trodden
on
believe
me
my
how
that
golden
glow
of
yours
is
blooming
your
garden
looks
fine
poor
elizabeth
always
took
such
care
of
it
i
love
it
said
anne
i
glad
it
so
full
of
flowers
speaking
of
gardening
we
want
to
get
a
man
to
dig
up
that
little
lot
beyond
the
fir
grove
and
set
it
out
with
strawberry
plants
for
us
gilbert
is
so
busy
he
will
never
get
time
for
it
this
fall
do
you
know
anyone
we
can
get
well
henry
hammond
up
at
the
glen
goes
out
doing
jobs
like
that
he
do
maybe
he
always
a
heap
more
interested
in
his
wages
than
in
his
work
just
like
a
man
and
he
so
slow
in
the
uptake
that
he
stands
still
for
five
minutes
before
it
dawns
on
him
that
he
stopped
his
father
threw
a
stump
at
him
when
he
was
small
nice
gentle
missile
was
it
so
like
a
man
course
the
boy
never
got
over
it
but
he
the
only
one
i
can
recommend
at
all
he
painted
my
house
for
me
last
spring
it
looks
real
nice
now
do
you
think
anne
was
saved
by
the
clock
striking
five
lord
is
it
that
late
exclaimed
miss
cornelia
how
time
does
slip
by
when
you
enjoying
yourself
well
i
must
betake
myself
home
no
indeed
you
are
going
to
stay
and
have
tea
with
us
said
anne
eagerly
are
you
asking
me
because
you
think
you
ought
to
or
because
you
really
want
to
demanded
miss
cornelia
because
i
really
want
to
then
i
stay
you
belong
to
the
race
that
knows
joseph
i
know
we
are
going
to
be
friends
said
anne
with
the
smile
that
only
they
of
the
household
of
faith
ever
saw
yes
we
are
dearie
thank
goodness
we
can
choose
our
friends
we
have
to
take
our
relatives
as
they
are
and
be
thankful
if
there
are
no
penitentiary
birds
among
them
not
that
i
many
none
nearer
than
second
cousins
i
a
kind
of
lonely
soul
mrs
blythe
there
was
a
wistful
note
in
miss
cornelia
voice
i
wish
you
would
call
me
anne
exclaimed
anne
impulsively
it
would
seem
more
homey
everyone
in
four
winds
except
my
husband
calls
me
blythe
and
it
makes
me
feel
like
a
stranger
do
you
know
that
your
name
is
very
near
being
the
one
i
yearned
after
when
i
was
a
child
i
hated
and
i
called
myself
in
imagination
i
like
anne
it
was
my
mother
name
names
are
the
best
and
sweetest
in
my
opinion
if
you
going
to
get
tea
you
might
send
the
young
doctor
to
talk
to
me
he
been
lying
on
the
sofa
in
that
office
ever
since
i
came
laughing
fit
to
kill
over
what
i
been
saying
how
did
you
know
cried
anne
too
aghast
at
this
instance
of
miss
cornelia
uncanny
prescience
to
make
a
polite
denial
i
saw
him
sitting
beside
you
when
i
came
up
the
lane
and
i
know
tricks
retorted
miss
cornelia
there
i
finished
my
little
dress
dearie
and
the
eighth
baby
can
come
as
soon
as
it
pleases
chapter
an
evening
at
four
winds
point
it
was
late
september
when
anne
and
gilbert
were
able
to
pay
four
winds
light
their
promised
visit
they
had
often
planned
to
go
but
something
always
occurred
to
prevent
them
captain
jim
had
dropped
in
several
times
at
the
little
house
i
do
stand
on
ceremony
mistress
blythe
he
told
anne
it
a
real
pleasure
to
me
to
come
here
and
i
not
going
to
deny
myself
jest
because
you
have
got
down
to
see
me
there
ought
to
be
no
bargaining
like
that
among
the
race
that
knows
joseph
i
come
when
i
can
and
you
come
when
you
can
and
so
long
we
have
our
pleasant
little
chat
it
do
matter
a
mite
what
roof
over
us
captain
jim
took
a
great
fancy
to
gog
and
magog
who
were
presiding
over
the
destinies
of
the
hearth
in
the
little
house
with
as
much
dignity
and
aplomb
as
they
had
done
at
patty
place
are
they
the
cutest
little
cusses
he
would
say
delightedly
and
he
bade
them
greeting
and
farewell
as
gravely
and
invariably
as
he
did
his
host
and
hostess
captain
jim
was
not
going
to
offend
household
deities
by
any
lack
of
reverence
and
ceremony
you
made
this
little
house
just
about
perfect
he
told
anne
it
never
was
so
nice
before
mistress
selwyn
had
your
taste
and
she
did
wonders
but
folks
in
those
days
did
have
the
pretty
little
curtains
and
pictures
and
nicknacks
you
have
as
for
elizabeth
she
lived
in
the
past
you
kinder
brought
the
future
into
it
so
to
speak
be
real
happy
even
if
we
could
talk
at
all
when
i
come
here
jest
to
sit
and
look
at
you
and
your
pictures
and
your
flowers
would
be
enough
of
a
treat
it
beautiful
beautiful
captain
jim
was
a
passionate
worshipper
of
beauty
every
lovely
thing
heard
or
seen
gave
him
a
deep
subtle
inner
joy
that
irradiated
his
life
he
was
quite
keenly
aware
of
his
own
lack
of
outward
comeliness
and
lamented
it
folks
say
i
good
he
remarked
whimsically
upon
one
occasion
but
i
sometimes
wish
the
lord
had
made
me
only
half
as
good
and
put
the
rest
of
it
into
looks
but
there
i
reckon
he
knew
what
he
was
about
as
a
good
captain
should
some
of
us
have
to
be
homely
or
the
purty
ones
like
mistress
blythe
here
would
show
up
so
well
one
evening
anne
and
gilbert
finally
walked
down
to
the
four
winds
light
the
day
had
begun
sombrely
in
gray
cloud
and
mist
but
it
had
ended
in
a
pomp
of
scarlet
and
gold
over
the
western
hills
beyond
the
harbor
were
amber
deeps
and
crystalline
shallows
with
the
fire
of
sunset
below
the
north
was
a
mackerel
sky
of
little
fiery
golden
clouds
the
red
light
flamed
on
the
white
sails
of
a
vessel
gliding
down
the
channel
bound
to
a
southern
port
in
a
land
of
palms
beyond
her
it
smote
upon
and
incarnadined
the
shining
white
grassless
faces
of
the
sand
dunes
to
the
right
it
fell
on
the
old
house
among
the
willows
up
the
brook
and
gave
it
for
a
fleeting
space
casements
more
splendid
than
those
of
an
old
cathedral
they
glowed
out
of
its
quiet
and
grayness
like
the
throbbing
thoughts
of
a
vivid
soul
imprisoned
in
a
dull
husk
of
environment
that
old
house
up
the
brook
always
seems
so
lonely
said
anne
i
never
see
visitors
there
of
course
its
lane
opens
on
the
upper
road
but
i
do
think
there
much
coming
and
going
it
seems
odd
we
never
met
the
moores
yet
when
they
live
within
fifteen
walk
of
us
i
may
have
seen
them
in
church
of
course
but
if
so
i
did
know
them
i
sorry
they
are
so
unsociable
when
they
are
our
only
near
neighbors
evidently
they
do
belong
to
the
race
that
knows
joseph
laughed
gilbert
have
you
ever
found
out
who
that
girl
was
whom
you
thought
so
beautiful
no
somehow
i
have
never
remembered
to
ask
about
her
but
i
never
seen
her
anywhere
so
i
suppose
she
must
have
been
a
stranger
oh
the
sun
has
just
vanished
and
there
the
light
as
the
dusk
deepened
the
great
beacon
cut
swathes
of
light
through
it
sweeping
in
a
circle
over
the
fields
and
the
harbor
the
sandbar
and
the
gulf
i
feel
as
if
it
might
catch
me
and
whisk
me
leagues
out
to
sea
said
anne
as
one
drenched
them
with
radiance
and
she
felt
rather
relieved
when
they
got
so
near
the
point
that
they
were
inside
the
range
of
those
dazzling
recurrent
flashes
as
they
turned
into
the
little
lane
that
led
across
the
fields
to
the
point
they
met
a
man
coming
out
of
it
a
man
of
such
extraordinary
appearance
that
for
a
moment
they
both
frankly
stared
he
was
a
decidedly
with
a
roman
nose
and
frank
gray
eyes
he
was
dressed
in
a
prosperous
farmer
sunday
best
in
so
far
he
might
have
been
any
inhabitant
of
four
winds
or
the
glen
but
flowing
over
his
breast
nearly
to
his
knees
was
a
river
of
crinkly
brown
beard
and
adown
his
back
beneath
his
commonplace
felt
hat
was
a
corresponding
cascade
of
thick
wavy
brown
hair
anne
murmured
gilbert
when
they
were
out
of
earshot
you
put
what
uncle
dave
calls
little
of
the
scott
act
in
that
lemonade
you
gave
me
just
before
we
left
home
did
you
no
i
did
said
anne
stifling
her
laughter
lest
the
retreating
enigma
should
hear
here
who
in
the
world
can
he
be
i
do
know
but
if
captain
jim
keeps
apparitions
like
that
down
at
this
point
i
going
to
carry
cold
iron
in
my
pocket
when
i
come
here
he
was
a
sailor
or
one
might
pardon
his
eccentricity
of
appearance
he
must
belong
to
the
clans
uncle
dave
says
they
have
several
freaks
over
there
uncle
dave
is
a
little
prejudiced
i
think
you
know
all
the
people
who
come
to
the
glen
church
seem
very
nice
oh
gilbert
is
this
beautiful
the
four
winds
light
was
built
on
a
spur
of
red
cliff
jutting
out
into
the
gulf
on
one
side
across
the
channel
stretched
the
silvery
sand
shore
of
the
bar
on
the
other
extended
a
long
curving
beach
of
red
cliffs
rising
steeply
from
the
pebbled
coves
it
was
a
shore
that
knew
the
magic
and
mystery
of
storm
and
star
there
is
a
great
solitude
about
such
a
shore
the
woods
are
never
solitary
they
are
full
of
whispering
beckoning
friendly
life
but
the
sea
is
a
mighty
soul
forever
moaning
of
some
great
unshareable
sorrow
which
shuts
it
up
into
itself
for
all
eternity
we
can
never
pierce
its
infinite
mystery
we
may
only
wander
awed
and
spellbound
on
the
outer
fringe
of
it
the
woods
call
to
us
with
a
hundred
voices
but
the
sea
has
one
only
a
mighty
voice
that
drowns
our
souls
in
its
majestic
music
the
woods
are
human
but
the
sea
is
of
the
company
of
the
archangels
anne
and
gilbert
found
uncle
jim
sitting
on
a
bench
outside
the
lighthouse
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
a
wonderful
toy
schooner
he
rose
and
welcomed
them
to
his
abode
with
the
gentle
unconscious
courtesy
that
became
him
so
well
this
has
been
a
purty
nice
day
all
through
mistress
blythe
and
now
right
at
the
last
it
brought
its
best
would
you
like
to
sit
down
here
outside
a
bit
while
the
light
lasts
i
just
finished
this
bit
of
a
plaything
for
my
little
grand
nephew
joe
up
at
the
glen
after
i
promised
to
make
it
for
him
i
was
kinder
sorry
for
his
mother
was
vexed
she
afraid
he
be
wanting
to
go
to
sea
later
on
and
she
does
want
the
notion
encouraged
in
him
but
what
could
i
do
mistress
blythe
i
promised
him
and
i
think
it
sorter
real
dastardly
to
break
a
promise
you
make
to
a
child
come
sit
down
it
wo
take
long
to
stay
an
hour
the
wind
was
off
shore
and
only
broke
the
sea
surface
into
long
silvery
ripples
and
sent
sheeny
shadows
flying
out
across
it
from
every
point
and
headland
like
transparent
wings
the
dusk
was
hanging
a
curtain
of
violet
gloom
over
the
sand
dunes
and
the
headlands
where
gulls
were
huddling
the
sky
was
faintly
filmed
over
with
scarfs
of
silken
vapor
cloud
fleets
rode
at
anchor
along
the
horizons
an
evening
star
was
watching
over
the
bar
is
that
a
view
worth
looking
at
said
captain
jim
with
a
loving
proprietary
pride
nice
and
far
from
the
ai
it
no
buying
and
selling
and
getting
gain
you
do
have
to
pay
anything
all
that
sea
and
sky
free
money
and
without
price
there
going
to
be
a
moonrise
purty
soon
too
i
never
tired
of
finding
out
what
a
moonrise
can
be
over
them
rocks
and
sea
and
harbor
there
a
surprise
in
it
every
time
they
had
their
moonrise
and
watched
its
marvel
and
magic
in
a
silence
that
asked
nothing
of
the
world
or
each
other
then
they
went
up
into
the
tower
and
captain
jim
showed
and
explained
the
mechanism
of
the
great
light
finally
they
found
themselves
in
the
dining
room
where
a
fire
of
driftwood
was
weaving
flames
of
wavering
elusive
hues
in
the
open
fireplace
i
put
this
fireplace
in
myself
remarked
captain
jim
the
government
do
give
lighthouse
keepers
such
luxuries
look
at
the
colors
that
wood
makes
if
you
like
some
driftwood
for
your
fire
mistress
blythe
i
bring
you
up
a
load
some
day
sit
down
going
to
make
you
a
cup
of
tea
captain
jim
placed
a
chair
for
anne
having
first
removed
therefrom
a
huge
cat
and
a
newspaper
get
down
matey
the
sofa
is
your
place
i
must
put
this
paper
away
safe
till
i
can
find
time
to
finish
the
story
in
it
it
called
a
mad
love
is
my
favorite
brand
of
fiction
but
i
reading
it
jest
to
see
how
long
she
can
spin
it
out
it
at
the
chapter
now
and
the
wedding
ai
any
nearer
than
when
it
begun
far
i
can
see
when
little
joe
comes
i
have
to
read
him
pirate
yarns
ai
it
strange
how
innocent
little
creatures
like
children
like
the
stories
like
my
lad
davy
at
home
said
anne
he
wants
tales
that
reek
with
gore
captain
jim
tea
proved
to
be
nectar
he
was
pleased
as
a
child
with
anne
compliments
but
he
affected
a
fine
indifference
the
secret
is
i
do
skimp
the
cream
he
remarked
airily
captain
jim
had
never
heard
of
oliver
wendell
holmes
but
he
evidently
agreed
with
that
writer
dictum
that
big
heart
never
liked
little
cream
pot
we
met
an
personage
coming
out
of
your
lane
said
gilbert
as
they
sipped
who
was
he
captain
jim
grinned
that
marshall
elliott
a
mighty
fine
man
with
jest
one
streak
of
foolishness
in
him
i
you
wondered
what
his
object
was
in
turning
himself
into
a
sort
of
dime
museum
freak
is
he
a
modern
nazarite
or
a
hebrew
prophet
left
over
from
olden
times
asked
anne
neither
of
them
it
politics
that
at
the
bottom
of
his
freak
all
those
elliotts
and
crawfords
and
macallisters
are
politicians
they
born
grit
or
tory
as
the
case
may
be
and
they
live
grit
or
tory
and
they
die
grit
or
tory
and
what
they
going
to
do
in
heaven
where
there
probably
no
politics
is
more
than
i
can
fathom
this
marshall
elliott
was
born
a
grit
i
a
grit
myself
in
moderation
but
there
no
moderation
about
marshall
fifteen
years
ago
there
was
a
specially
bitter
general
election
marshall
fought
for
his
party
tooth
and
nail
he
was
dead
sure
the
liberals
would
win
so
sure
that
he
got
up
at
a
public
meeting
and
vowed
that
he
shave
his
face
or
cut
his
hair
until
the
grits
were
in
power
well
they
did
go
in
and
they
never
got
in
yet
and
you
saw
the
result
today
for
yourselves
marshall
stuck
to
his
word
what
does
his
wife
think
of
it
asked
anne
he
a
bachelor
but
if
he
had
a
wife
i
reckon
she
could
make
him
break
that
vow
that
family
of
elliotts
has
always
been
more
stubborn
than
natteral
marshall
brother
alexander
had
a
dog
he
set
great
store
by
and
when
it
died
the
man
actilly
wanted
to
have
it
buried
in
the
graveyard
with
the
other
christians
he
said
course
he
was
allowed
to
so
he
buried
it
just
outside
the
graveyard
fence
and
never
darkened
the
church
door
again
but
sundays
he
drive
his
family
to
church
and
sit
by
that
dog
grave
and
read
his
bible
all
the
time
service
was
going
on
they
say
when
he
was
dying
he
asked
his
wife
to
bury
him
beside
the
dog
she
was
a
meek
little
soul
but
she
fired
up
at
that
she
said
she
was
going
to
be
buried
beside
no
dog
and
if
he
rather
have
his
last
resting
place
beside
the
dog
than
beside
her
jest
to
say
so
alexander
elliott
was
a
stubborn
mule
but
he
was
fond
of
his
wife
so
he
give
in
and
said
durn
it
bury
me
where
you
please
but
when
gabriel
trump
blows
i
expect
my
dog
to
rise
with
the
rest
of
us
for
he
had
as
much
soul
as
any
durned
elliott
or
crawford
or
macallister
that
ever
strutted
them
was
his
parting
words
as
for
marshall
we
all
used
to
him
but
he
must
strike
strangers
as
right
down
i
known
him
ever
since
he
was
ten
he
about
fifty
now
and
i
like
him
him
and
me
was
out
today
that
about
all
i
good
for
now
catching
trout
and
cod
occasional
but
always
so
not
by
no
manner
of
means
i
used
to
do
other
things
as
you
admit
if
you
saw
my
anne
was
just
going
to
ask
what
his
was
when
the
first
mate
created
a
diversion
by
springing
upon
captain
jim
knee
he
was
a
gorgeous
beastie
with
a
face
as
round
as
a
full
moon
vivid
green
eyes
and
immense
white
double
paws
captain
jim
stroked
his
velvet
back
gently
i
never
fancied
cats
much
till
i
found
the
first
mate
he
remarked
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
mate
tremendous
purrs
i
saved
his
life
and
when
you
saved
a
creature
life
you
bound
to
love
it
it
next
thing
to
giving
life
there
some
turrible
thoughtless
people
in
the
world
mistress
blythe
some
of
them
city
folks
who
have
summer
homes
over
the
harbor
are
so
thoughtless
that
they
cruel
it
the
worst
kind
of
cruelty
the
thoughtless
kind
you
ca
cope
with
it
they
keep
cats
there
in
the
summer
and
feed
and
pet
and
doll
up
with
ribbons
and
collars
and
then
in
the
fall
they
go
off
and
leave
to
starve
or
freeze
it
makes
my
blood
boil
mistress
blythe
one
day
last
winter
i
found
a
poor
old
mother
cat
dead
on
the
shore
lying
against
the
bodies
of
her
three
little
kittens
she
died
trying
to
shelter
she
had
her
poor
stiff
paws
around
master
i
cried
then
i
swore
then
i
carried
them
poor
little
kittens
home
and
fed
up
and
found
good
homes
for
i
knew
the
woman
who
left
the
cat
and
when
she
come
back
this
summer
i
jest
went
over
the
harbor
and
told
her
my
opinion
of
her
it
was
rank
meddling
but
i
do
love
meddling
in
a
good
cause
how
did
she
take
it
asked
gilbert
cried
and
said
she
think
i
says
to
her
says
i
you
that
be
held
for
a
good
excuse
in
the
day
of
jedgment
when
you
have
to
account
for
that
poor
old
mother
life
the
ask
you
what
he
give
you
your
brains
for
if
it
was
to
think
i
reckon
i
do
fancy
she
leave
cats
to
starve
another
time
was
the
first
mate
one
of
the
forsaken
asked
anne
making
advances
to
him
which
were
responded
to
graciously
if
condescendingly
yes
i
found
him
one
bitter
cold
day
in
winter
caught
in
the
branches
of
a
tree
by
his
ribbon
collar
he
was
almost
starving
if
you
could
have
seen
his
eyes
mistress
blythe
he
was
nothing
but
a
kitten
and
he
got
his
living
somehow
since
he
been
left
until
he
got
hung
up
when
i
loosed
him
he
gave
my
hand
a
pitiful
swipe
with
his
little
red
tongue
he
was
the
able
seaman
you
see
now
he
was
meek
as
moses
that
was
nine
years
ago
his
life
has
been
long
in
the
land
for
a
cat
he
a
good
old
pal
the
first
mate
is
i
should
have
expected
you
to
have
a
dog
said
gilbert
captain
jim
shook
his
head
i
had
a
dog
once
i
thought
so
much
of
him
that
when
he
died
i
could
bear
the
thought
of
getting
another
in
his
place
he
was
a
friend
you
understand
mistress
blythe
matey
only
a
pal
i
fond
of
matey
all
the
fonder
on
account
of
the
spice
of
devilment
that
in
him
like
there
is
in
all
cats
but
i
loved
my
dog
i
always
had
a
sneaking
sympathy
for
alexander
elliott
about
his
dog
there
is
any
devil
in
a
good
dog
that
why
they
more
lovable
than
cats
i
reckon
but
i
darned
if
they
as
interesting
here
i
am
talking
too
much
why
do
you
check
me
when
i
do
get
a
chance
to
talk
to
anyone
i
run
on
turrible
if
you
done
your
tea
i
a
few
little
things
you
might
like
to
look
at
picked
up
in
the
queer
corners
i
used
to
be
poking
my
nose
into
captain
jim
few
little
things
turned
out
to
be
a
most
interesting
collection
of
curios
hideous
quaint
and
beautiful
and
almost
every
one
had
some
striking
story
attached
to
it
anne
never
forgot
the
delight
with
which
she
listened
to
those
old
tales
that
moonlit
evening
by
that
enchanted
driftwood
fire
while
the
silver
sea
called
to
them
through
the
open
window
and
sobbed
against
the
rocks
below
them
captain
jim
never
said
a
boastful
word
but
it
was
impossible
to
help
seeing
what
a
hero
the
man
had
been
brave
true
resourceful
unselfish
he
sat
there
in
his
little
room
and
made
those
things
live
again
for
his
hearers
by
a
lift
of
the
eyebrow
a
twist
of
the
lip
a
gesture
a
word
he
painted
a
whole
scene
or
character
so
that
they
saw
it
as
it
was
some
of
captain
jim
adventures
had
such
a
marvellous
edge
that
anne
and
gilbert
secretly
wondered
if
he
were
not
drawing
a
rather
long
bow
at
their
credulous
expense
but
in
this
as
they
found
later
they
did
him
injustice
his
tales
were
all
literally
true
captain
jim
had
the
gift
of
the
born
storyteller
whereby
unhappy
things
can
be
brought
vividly
before
the
hearer
in
all
their
pristine
poignancy
anne
and
gilbert
laughed
and
shivered
over
his
tales
and
once
anne
found
herself
crying
captain
jim
surveyed
her
tears
with
pleasure
shining
from
his
face
i
like
to
see
folks
cry
that
way
he
remarked
it
a
compliment
but
i
ca
do
justice
to
the
things
i
seen
or
helped
to
do
all
jotted
down
in
my
but
i
have
got
the
knack
of
writing
them
out
properly
if
i
could
hit
on
jest
the
right
words
and
string
together
proper
on
paper
i
could
make
a
great
book
it
would
beat
a
mad
love
holler
and
i
believe
joe
like
it
as
well
as
the
pirate
yarns
yes
i
had
some
adventures
in
my
time
and
do
you
know
mistress
blythe
i
still
lust
after
yes
old
and
useless
as
i
be
there
an
awful
longing
sweeps
over
me
at
times
to
sail
out
out
out
there
forever
and
ever
like
ulysses
you
would
beyond
the
sunset
and
the
baths
of
all
the
western
stars
until
you
die
said
anne
dreamily
ulysses
i
read
of
him
yes
that
just
how
i
feel
jest
how
all
us
old
sailors
feel
i
reckon
i
die
on
land
after
all
i
well
what
is
to
be
will
be
there
was
old
william
ford
at
the
glen
who
never
went
on
the
water
in
his
life
he
was
afraid
of
being
drowned
a
had
predicted
he
would
be
and
one
day
he
fainted
and
fell
with
his
face
in
the
barn
trough
and
was
drowned
must
you
go
well
come
soon
and
come
often
the
doctor
is
to
do
the
talking
next
time
he
knows
a
heap
of
things
i
want
to
find
out
sorter
lonesome
here
by
times
it
been
worse
since
elizabeth
russell
died
her
and
me
was
such
cronies
captain
jim
spoke
with
the
pathos
of
the
aged
who
see
their
old
friends
slipping
from
them
one
by
one
friends
whose
place
can
never
be
quite
filled
by
those
of
a
younger
generation
even
of
the
race
that
knows
joseph
anne
and
gilbert
promised
to
come
soon
and
often
he
a
rare
old
fellow
is
he
said
gilbert
as
they
walked
home
somehow
i
ca
reconcile
his
simple
kindly
personality
with
the
wild
adventurous
life
he
has
lived
mused
anne
you
would
find
it
so
hard
if
you
had
seen
him
the
other
day
down
at
the
fishing
village
one
of
the
men
of
peter
gautier
boat
made
a
nasty
remark
about
some
girl
along
the
shore
captain
jim
fairly
scorched
the
wretched
fellow
with
the
lightning
of
his
eyes
he
seemed
a
man
transformed
he
did
say
much
but
the
way
he
said
it
have
thought
it
would
strip
the
flesh
from
the
fellow
bones
i
understand
that
captain
jim
will
never
allow
a
word
against
any
woman
to
be
said
in
his
presence
i
wonder
why
he
never
married
said
anne
he
should
have
sons
with
their
ships
at
sea
now
and
grandchildren
climbing
over
him
to
hear
his
stories
he
that
kind
of
a
man
instead
he
has
nothing
but
a
magnificent
cat
but
anne
was
mistaken
captain
jim
had
more
than
that
he
had
a
memory
chapter
leslie
moore
i
going
for
a
walk
to
the
outside
shore
tonight
anne
told
gog
and
magog
one
october
evening
there
was
no
one
else
to
tell
for
gilbert
had
gone
over
the
harbor
anne
had
her
little
domain
in
the
speckless
order
one
would
expect
of
anyone
brought
up
by
marilla
cuthbert
and
felt
that
she
could
gad
shoreward
with
a
clear
conscience
many
and
delightful
had
been
her
shore
rambles
sometimes
with
gilbert
sometimes
with
captain
jim
sometimes
alone
with
her
own
thoughts
and
new
dreams
that
were
beginning
to
span
life
with
their
rainbows
she
loved
the
gentle
misty
harbor
shore
and
the
silvery
sand
shore
but
best
of
all
she
loved
the
rock
shore
with
its
cliffs
and
caves
and
piles
of
boulders
and
its
coves
where
the
pebbles
glittered
under
the
pools
and
it
was
to
this
shore
she
hied
herself
tonight
there
had
been
an
autumn
storm
of
wind
and
rain
lasting
for
three
days
thunderous
had
been
the
crash
of
billows
on
the
rocks
wild
the
white
spray
and
spume
that
blew
over
the
bar
troubled
and
misty
and
the
erstwhile
blue
peace
of
four
winds
harbor
now
it
was
over
and
the
shore
lay
after
the
storm
not
a
wind
stirred
but
there
was
still
a
fine
surf
on
dashing
on
sand
and
rock
in
a
splendid
white
turmoil
the
only
restless
thing
in
the
great
pervading
stillness
and
peace
oh
this
is
a
moment
worth
living
through
weeks
of
storm
and
stress
for
anne
exclaimed
delightedly
sending
her
far
gaze
across
the
tossing
waters
from
the
top
of
the
cliff
where
she
stood
presently
she
scrambled
down
the
steep
path
to
the
little
cove
below
where
she
seemed
shut
in
with
rocks
and
sea
and
sky
i
going
to
dance
and
sing
she
said
there
no
one
here
to
see
me
the
seagulls
wo
carry
tales
of
the
matter
i
may
be
as
crazy
as
i
like
she
caught
up
her
skirt
and
pirouetted
along
the
hard
strip
of
sand
just
out
of
reach
of
the
waves
that
almost
lapped
her
feet
with
their
spent
foam
whirling
round
and
round
laughing
like
a
child
she
reached
the
little
headland
that
ran
out
to
the
east
of
the
cove
then
she
stopped
suddenly
blushing
crimson
she
was
not
alone
there
had
been
a
witness
to
her
dance
and
laughter
the
girl
of
the
golden
hair
and
eyes
was
sitting
on
a
boulder
of
the
headland
by
a
jutting
rock
she
was
looking
straight
at
anne
with
a
strange
expression
part
wonder
part
sympathy
part
could
it
be
envy
she
was
and
her
splendid
hair
more
than
ever
like
browning
gorgeous
snake
was
bound
about
her
head
with
a
crimson
ribbon
she
wore
a
dress
of
some
dark
material
very
plainly
made
but
swathed
about
her
waist
outlining
its
fine
curves
was
a
vivid
girdle
of
red
silk
her
hands
clasped
over
her
knee
were
brown
and
somewhat
but
the
skin
of
her
throat
and
cheeks
was
as
white
as
cream
a
flying
gleam
of
sunset
broke
through
a
western
cloud
and
fell
across
her
hair
for
a
moment
she
seemed
the
spirit
of
the
sea
personified
all
its
mystery
all
its
passion
all
its
elusive
charm
you
you
must
think
me
crazy
stammered
anne
trying
to
recover
her
to
be
seen
by
this
stately
girl
in
such
an
abandon
of
childishness
she
blythe
with
all
the
dignity
of
the
matron
to
keep
up
it
was
too
bad
no
said
the
girl
i
do
she
said
nothing
more
her
voice
was
expressionless
her
manner
slightly
repellent
but
there
was
something
in
her
eyes
eager
yet
shy
defiant
yet
pleading
which
turned
anne
from
her
purpose
of
walking
away
instead
she
sat
down
on
the
boulder
beside
the
girl
let
introduce
ourselves
she
said
with
the
smile
that
had
never
yet
failed
to
win
confidence
and
friendliness
i
am
blythe
and
i
live
in
that
little
white
house
up
the
harbor
shore
yes
i
know
said
the
girl
i
am
leslie
moore
dick
moore
she
added
stiffly
anne
was
silent
for
a
moment
from
sheer
amazement
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
this
girl
was
married
there
seemed
nothing
of
the
wife
about
her
and
that
she
should
be
the
neighbor
whom
anne
had
pictured
as
a
commonplace
four
winds
housewife
anne
could
not
quickly
adjust
her
mental
focus
to
this
astonishing
change
then
then
you
live
in
that
gray
house
up
the
brook
she
stammered
yes
i
should
have
gone
over
to
call
on
you
long
ago
said
the
other
she
did
not
offer
any
explanation
or
excuse
for
not
having
gone
i
wish
you
would
come
said
anne
recovering
herself
somewhat
we
such
near
neighbors
we
ought
to
be
friends
that
is
the
sole
fault
of
four
winds
there
are
quite
enough
neighbors
otherwise
it
is
perfection
you
like
it
like
it
i
love
it
it
is
the
most
beautiful
place
i
ever
saw
i
never
seen
many
places
said
leslie
moore
slowly
but
always
thought
it
was
very
lovely
here
i
i
love
it
too
she
spoke
as
she
looked
shyly
yet
eagerly
anne
had
an
odd
impression
that
this
strange
girl
the
word
girl
would
persist
could
say
a
good
deal
if
she
chose
i
often
come
to
the
shore
she
added
so
do
i
said
anne
it
a
wonder
we
have
met
here
before
probably
you
come
earlier
in
the
evening
than
i
do
it
is
generally
late
almost
dark
when
i
come
and
i
love
to
come
just
after
a
storm
like
this
i
do
like
the
sea
so
well
when
it
calm
and
quiet
i
like
the
struggle
and
the
crash
and
the
noise
i
love
it
in
all
its
moods
declared
anne
the
sea
at
four
winds
is
to
me
what
lover
lane
was
at
home
tonight
it
seemed
so
free
so
untamed
something
broke
loose
in
me
too
out
of
sympathy
that
was
why
i
danced
along
the
shore
in
that
wild
way
i
did
suppose
anybody
was
looking
of
course
if
miss
cornelia
bryant
had
seen
me
she
would
have
forboded
a
gloomy
prospect
for
poor
young
dr
blythe
you
know
miss
cornelia
said
leslie
laughing
she
had
an
exquisite
laugh
it
bubbled
up
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
with
something
of
the
delicious
quality
of
a
baby
anne
laughed
too
oh
yes
she
has
been
down
to
my
house
of
dreams
several
times
your
house
of
dreams
oh
that
a
dear
foolish
little
name
gilbert
and
i
have
for
our
home
we
just
call
it
that
between
ourselves
it
slipped
out
before
i
thought
so
miss
russell
little
white
house
is
your
house
of
dreams
said
leslie
wonderingly
had
a
house
of
dreams
once
but
it
was
a
palace
she
added
with
a
laugh
the
sweetness
of
which
was
marred
by
a
little
note
of
derision
oh
i
once
dreamed
of
a
palace
too
said
anne
i
suppose
all
girls
do
and
then
we
settle
down
contentedly
in
houses
that
seem
to
fulfill
all
the
desires
of
our
hearts
because
our
prince
is
there
you
should
have
had
your
palace
really
though
you
are
so
beautiful
you
must
let
me
say
it
it
has
to
be
said
i
nearly
bursting
with
admiration
you
are
the
loveliest
thing
i
ever
saw
mrs
moore
if
we
are
to
be
friends
you
must
call
me
leslie
said
the
other
with
an
odd
passion
of
course
i
will
and
my
friends
call
me
anne
i
suppose
i
am
beautiful
leslie
went
on
looking
stormily
out
to
sea
i
hate
my
beauty
i
wish
i
had
always
been
as
brown
and
plain
as
the
brownest
and
plainest
girl
at
the
fishing
village
over
there
well
what
do
you
think
of
miss
cornelia
the
abrupt
change
of
subject
shut
the
door
on
any
further
confidences
miss
cornelia
is
a
darling
is
she
said
anne
gilbert
and
i
were
invited
to
her
house
to
a
state
tea
last
week
you
heard
of
groaning
tables
i
seem
to
recall
seeing
the
expression
in
the
newspaper
reports
of
weddings
said
leslie
smiling
well
miss
cornelia
groaned
at
least
it
creaked
positively
you
could
have
believed
she
would
have
cooked
so
much
for
two
ordinary
people
she
had
every
kind
of
pie
you
could
name
i
think
except
lemon
pie
she
said
she
had
taken
the
prize
for
lemon
pies
at
the
charlottetown
exhibition
ten
years
ago
and
had
never
made
any
since
for
fear
of
losing
her
reputation
for
them
were
you
able
to
eat
enough
pie
to
please
her
was
gilbert
won
her
heart
by
eating
i
wo
tell
you
how
much
she
said
she
never
knew
a
man
who
did
like
pie
better
than
his
bible
do
you
know
i
love
miss
cornelia
so
do
i
said
leslie
she
is
the
best
friend
i
have
in
the
world
anne
wondered
secretly
why
if
this
were
so
miss
cornelia
had
never
mentioned
dick
moore
to
her
miss
cornelia
had
certainly
talked
freely
about
every
other
individual
in
or
near
four
winds
is
that
beautiful
said
leslie
after
a
brief
silence
pointing
to
the
exquisite
effect
of
a
shaft
of
light
falling
through
a
cleft
in
the
rock
behind
them
across
a
dark
green
pool
at
its
base
if
i
had
come
here
and
seen
nothing
but
just
that
i
would
go
home
satisfied
the
effects
of
light
and
shadow
all
along
these
shores
are
wonderful
agreed
anne
my
little
sewing
room
looks
out
on
the
harbor
and
i
sit
at
its
window
and
feast
my
eyes
the
colors
and
shadows
are
never
the
same
two
minutes
together
and
you
are
never
lonely
asked
leslie
abruptly
never
when
you
are
alone
no
i
do
think
i
ever
been
really
lonely
in
my
life
answered
anne
even
when
i
alone
i
have
real
good
company
dreams
and
imaginations
and
pretendings
i
like
to
be
alone
now
and
then
just
to
think
over
things
and
taste
them
but
i
love
friendship
and
nice
jolly
little
times
with
people
oh
wo
you
come
to
see
me
often
please
do
i
believe
anne
added
laughing
that
you
like
me
if
you
knew
me
i
wonder
if
you
would
like
me
said
leslie
seriously
she
was
not
fishing
for
a
compliment
she
looked
out
across
the
waves
that
were
beginning
to
be
garlanded
with
blossoms
of
moonlit
foam
and
her
eyes
filled
with
shadows
i
sure
i
would
said
anne
and
please
do
think
i
utterly
irresponsible
because
you
saw
me
dancing
on
the
shore
at
sunset
no
doubt
i
shall
be
dignified
after
a
time
you
see
i
have
been
married
very
long
i
feel
like
a
girl
and
sometimes
like
a
child
yet
i
have
been
married
twelve
years
said
leslie
here
was
another
unbelievable
thing
why
you
ca
be
as
old
as
i
am
exclaimed
anne
you
must
have
been
a
child
when
you
were
married
i
was
sixteen
said
leslie
rising
and
picking
up
the
cap
and
jacket
lying
beside
her
i
am
now
well
i
must
go
back
so
must
gilbert
will
probably
be
home
but
i
so
glad
we
both
came
to
the
shore
tonight
and
met
each
other
leslie
said
nothing
and
anne
was
a
little
chilled
she
had
offered
friendship
frankly
but
it
had
not
been
accepted
very
graciously
if
it
had
not
been
absolutely
repelled
in
silence
they
climbed
the
cliffs
and
walked
across
a
of
which
the
feathery
bleached
wild
grasses
were
like
a
carpet
of
creamy
velvet
in
the
moonlight
when
they
reached
the
shore
lane
leslie
turned
i
go
this
way
blythe
you
will
come
over
and
see
me
some
time
wo
you
anne
felt
as
if
the
invitation
had
been
thrown
at
her
she
got
the
impression
that
leslie
moore
gave
it
reluctantly
i
will
come
if
you
really
want
me
to
she
said
a
little
coldly
oh
i
do
i
do
exclaimed
leslie
with
an
eagerness
which
seemed
to
burst
forth
and
beat
down
some
restraint
that
had
been
imposed
on
it
then
i
come
leslie
mrs
blythe
anne
walked
home
in
a
brown
study
and
poured
out
her
tale
to
gilbert
so
dick
moore
is
one
of
the
race
that
knows
joseph
said
gilbert
teasingly
no
o
o
not
exactly
and
yet
i
think
she
was
one
of
them
once
but
has
gone
or
got
into
exile
said
anne
musingly
she
is
certainly
very
different
from
the
other
women
about
here
you
ca
talk
about
eggs
and
butter
to
her
to
think
i
been
imagining
her
a
second
rachel
lynde
have
you
ever
seen
dick
moore
gilbert
no
i
seen
several
men
working
about
the
fields
of
the
farm
but
i
do
know
which
was
moore
she
never
mentioned
him
i
know
she
is
happy
from
what
you
tell
me
i
suppose
she
was
married
before
she
was
old
enough
to
know
her
own
mind
or
heart
and
found
out
too
late
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
it
a
common
tragedy
enough
anne
a
fine
woman
would
have
made
the
best
of
it
moore
has
evidently
let
it
make
her
bitter
and
resentful
do
let
us
judge
her
till
we
know
pleaded
anne
i
do
believe
her
case
is
so
ordinary
you
will
understand
her
fascination
when
you
meet
her
gilbert
it
is
a
thing
quite
apart
from
her
beauty
i
feel
that
she
possesses
a
rich
nature
into
which
a
friend
might
enter
as
into
a
kingdom
but
for
some
reason
she
bars
every
one
out
and
shuts
all
her
possibilities
up
in
herself
so
that
they
can
not
develop
and
blossom
there
i
been
struggling
to
define
her
to
myself
ever
since
i
left
her
and
that
is
the
nearest
i
can
get
to
it
i
going
to
ask
miss
cornelia
about
her
chapter
the
story
of
leslie
moore
yes
the
eighth
baby
arrived
a
fortnight
ago
said
miss
cornelia
from
a
rocker
before
the
fire
of
the
little
house
one
chilly
october
afternoon
it
a
girl
fred
was
ranting
mad
said
he
wanted
a
boy
when
the
truth
is
he
did
want
it
at
all
if
it
had
been
a
boy
he
have
ranted
because
it
was
a
girl
they
had
four
girls
and
three
boys
before
so
i
ca
see
that
it
made
much
difference
what
this
one
was
but
of
course
he
have
to
be
cantankerous
just
like
a
man
the
baby
is
real
pretty
dressed
up
in
its
nice
little
clothes
it
has
black
eyes
and
the
dearest
tiny
hands
i
must
go
and
see
it
i
just
love
babies
said
anne
smiling
to
herself
over
a
thought
too
dear
and
sacred
to
be
put
into
words
i
do
say
but
what
they
nice
admitted
miss
cornelia
but
some
folks
seem
to
have
more
than
they
really
need
believe
me
my
poor
cousin
flora
up
at
the
glen
had
eleven
and
such
a
slave
as
she
is
her
husband
suicided
three
years
ago
just
like
a
man
what
made
him
do
that
asked
anne
rather
shocked
could
get
his
way
over
something
so
he
jumped
into
the
well
a
good
riddance
he
was
a
born
tyrant
but
of
course
it
spoiled
the
well
flora
could
never
abide
the
thought
of
using
it
again
poor
thing
so
she
had
another
dug
and
a
frightful
expense
it
was
and
the
water
as
hard
as
nails
if
he
had
to
drown
himself
there
was
plenty
of
water
in
the
harbor
was
there
i
no
patience
with
a
man
like
that
we
only
had
two
suicides
in
four
winds
in
my
recollection
the
other
was
frank
west
leslie
moore
father
by
the
way
has
leslie
ever
been
over
to
call
on
you
yet
no
but
i
met
her
on
the
shore
a
few
nights
ago
and
we
scraped
an
acquaintance
said
anne
pricking
up
her
ears
miss
cornelia
nodded
i
glad
dearie
i
was
hoping
you
foregather
with
her
what
do
you
think
of
her
i
thought
her
very
beautiful
oh
of
course
there
was
never
anybody
about
four
winds
could
touch
her
for
looks
did
you
ever
see
her
hair
it
reaches
to
her
feet
when
she
lets
it
down
but
i
meant
how
did
you
like
her
i
think
i
could
like
her
very
much
if
she
let
me
said
anne
slowly
but
she
would
let
you
she
pushed
you
off
and
kept
you
at
length
poor
leslie
you
would
be
much
surprised
if
you
knew
what
her
life
has
been
it
been
a
tragedy
a
tragedy
repeated
miss
cornelia
emphatically
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
all
about
her
that
is
if
you
can
do
so
without
betraying
any
confidence
lord
dearie
everybody
in
four
winds
knows
poor
leslie
story
no
secret
the
outside
that
is
nobody
knows
the
inside
but
leslie
herself
and
she
does
take
folks
into
her
confidence
i
about
the
best
friend
she
has
on
earth
i
reckon
and
she
never
uttered
a
word
of
complaint
to
me
have
you
ever
seen
dick
moore
no
well
i
may
as
well
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
you
everything
straight
through
so
you
understand
it
as
i
said
leslie
father
was
frank
west
he
was
clever
and
shiftless
just
like
a
man
oh
he
had
heaps
of
brains
and
much
good
they
did
him
he
started
to
go
to
college
and
he
went
for
two
years
and
then
his
health
broke
down
the
wests
were
all
inclined
to
be
consumptive
so
frank
came
home
and
started
farming
he
married
rose
elliott
from
over
harbor
rose
was
reckoned
the
beauty
of
four
winds
leslie
takes
her
looks
from
her
mother
but
she
has
ten
times
the
spirit
and
go
that
rose
had
and
a
far
better
figure
now
you
know
anne
i
always
take
the
ground
that
us
women
ought
to
stand
by
each
other
we
got
enough
to
endure
at
the
hands
of
the
men
the
lord
knows
so
i
hold
we
had
ought
to
one
another
and
it
is
often
you
find
me
running
down
another
woman
but
i
never
had
much
use
for
rose
elliott
she
was
spoiled
to
begin
with
believe
me
and
she
was
nothing
but
a
lazy
selfish
whining
creature
frank
was
no
hand
to
work
so
they
were
poor
as
job
turkey
poor
they
lived
on
potatoes
and
point
believe
me
they
had
two
children
leslie
and
kenneth
leslie
had
her
mother
looks
and
her
father
brains
and
something
she
did
get
from
either
of
them
she
took
after
her
grandmother
west
a
splendid
old
lady
she
was
the
brightest
friendliest
merriest
thing
when
she
was
a
child
anne
everybody
liked
her
she
was
her
father
favorite
and
she
was
awful
fond
of
him
they
were
as
she
used
to
say
she
could
see
any
of
his
faults
and
he
was
a
taking
sort
of
man
in
some
ways
well
when
leslie
was
twelve
years
old
the
first
dreadful
thing
happened
she
worshipped
little
kenneth
he
was
four
years
younger
than
her
and
he
was
a
dear
little
chap
and
he
was
killed
one
day
fell
off
a
big
load
of
hay
just
as
it
was
going
into
the
barn
and
the
wheel
went
right
over
his
little
body
and
crushed
the
life
out
of
it
and
mind
you
anne
leslie
saw
it
she
was
looking
down
from
the
loft
she
gave
one
screech
the
hired
man
said
he
never
heard
such
a
sound
in
all
his
life
he
said
it
would
ring
in
his
ears
till
trump
drove
it
out
but
she
never
screeched
or
cried
again
about
it
she
jumped
from
the
loft
onto
the
load
and
from
the
load
to
the
floor
and
caught
up
the
little
bleeding
warm
dead
body
anne
they
had
to
tear
it
from
her
before
she
would
let
it
go
they
sent
for
me
i
talk
of
it
miss
cornelia
wiped
the
tears
from
her
kindly
brown
eyes
and
sewed
in
bitter
silence
for
a
few
minutes
well
she
resumed
it
was
all
over
they
buried
little
kenneth
in
that
graveyard
over
the
harbor
and
after
a
while
leslie
went
back
to
her
school
and
her
studies
she
never
mentioned
kenneth
name
never
heard
it
cross
her
lips
from
that
day
to
this
i
reckon
that
old
hurt
still
aches
and
burns
at
times
but
she
was
only
a
child
and
time
is
real
kind
to
children
anne
dearie
after
a
while
she
began
to
laugh
again
she
had
the
prettiest
laugh
you
do
often
hear
it
now
i
heard
it
once
the
other
night
said
anne
it
is
a
beautiful
laugh
frank
west
began
to
go
down
after
kenneth
death
he
was
strong
and
it
was
a
shock
to
him
because
he
was
real
fond
of
the
child
though
as
i
said
leslie
was
his
favorite
he
got
mopy
and
melancholy
and
could
or
would
work
and
one
day
when
leslie
was
fourteen
years
of
age
he
hanged
himself
and
in
the
parlor
too
mind
you
anne
right
in
the
middle
of
the
parlor
from
the
lamp
hook
in
the
ceiling
was
that
like
a
man
it
was
the
anniversary
of
his
wedding
day
too
nice
tasty
time
to
pick
for
it
was
it
and
of
course
that
poor
leslie
had
to
be
the
one
to
find
him
she
went
into
the
parlor
that
morning
singing
with
some
fresh
flowers
for
the
vases
and
there
she
saw
her
father
hanging
from
the
ceiling
his
face
as
black
as
a
coal
it
was
something
awful
believe
me
oh
how
horrible
said
anne
shuddering
the
poor
poor
child
leslie
did
cry
at
her
father
funeral
any
more
then
she
had
cried
at
kenneth
rose
whooped
and
howled
for
two
however
and
leslie
had
all
she
could
do
trying
to
calm
and
comfort
her
mother
i
was
disgusted
with
rose
and
so
was
everyone
else
but
leslie
never
got
out
of
patience
she
loved
her
mother
leslie
is
clannish
her
own
could
never
do
wrong
in
her
eyes
well
they
buried
frank
west
beside
kenneth
and
rose
put
up
a
great
big
monument
to
him
it
was
bigger
than
his
character
believe
me
anyhow
it
was
bigger
than
rose
could
afford
for
the
farm
was
mortgaged
for
more
than
its
value
but
not
long
after
leslie
old
grandmother
west
died
and
she
left
leslie
a
little
money
enough
to
give
her
a
year
at
queen
academy
leslie
had
made
up
her
mind
to
pass
for
a
teacher
if
she
could
and
then
earn
enough
to
put
herself
through
redmond
college
that
had
been
her
father
pet
scheme
he
wanted
her
to
have
what
he
had
lost
leslie
was
full
of
ambition
and
her
head
was
chock
full
of
brains
she
went
to
queen
and
she
took
two
years
work
in
one
year
and
got
her
first
and
when
she
came
home
she
got
the
glen
school
she
was
so
happy
and
hopeful
and
full
of
life
and
eagerness
when
i
think
of
what
she
was
then
and
what
she
is
now
i
say
drat
the
men
miss
cornelia
snipped
her
thread
off
as
viciously
as
if
she
was
severing
the
neck
of
mankind
by
the
stroke
dick
moore
came
into
her
life
that
summer
his
father
abner
moore
kept
store
at
the
glen
but
dick
had
a
streak
in
him
from
his
mother
he
used
to
sail
in
summer
and
clerk
in
his
father
store
in
winter
he
was
a
big
handsome
fellow
with
a
little
ugly
soul
he
was
always
wanting
something
till
he
got
it
and
then
he
stopped
wanting
it
just
like
a
man
oh
he
did
growl
at
the
weather
when
it
was
fine
and
he
was
mostly
real
pleasant
and
agreeable
when
everything
went
right
but
he
drank
a
good
deal
and
there
were
some
nasty
stories
told
of
him
and
a
girl
down
at
the
fishing
village
he
was
fit
for
leslie
to
wipe
her
feet
on
that
the
long
and
short
of
it
and
he
was
a
methodist
but
he
was
clean
mad
about
her
because
of
her
good
looks
in
the
first
place
and
because
she
would
have
anything
to
say
to
him
in
the
second
he
vowed
he
have
her
and
he
got
her
how
did
he
bring
it
about
oh
it
was
an
iniquitous
thing
i
never
forgive
rose
west
you
see
dearie
abner
moore
held
the
mortgage
on
the
west
farm
and
the
interest
was
overdue
some
years
and
dick
just
went
and
told
west
that
if
leslie
would
marry
him
he
get
his
father
to
foreclose
the
mortgage
rose
carried
on
terrible
fainted
and
wept
and
pleaded
with
leslie
not
to
let
her
be
turned
out
of
her
home
she
said
it
would
break
her
heart
to
leave
the
home
she
come
to
as
a
bride
i
have
blamed
her
for
feeling
dreadful
bad
over
it
but
you
would
have
thought
she
be
so
selfish
as
to
sacrifice
her
own
flesh
and
blood
because
of
it
would
you
well
she
was
and
leslie
gave
in
she
loved
her
mother
so
much
she
would
have
done
anything
to
save
her
pain
she
married
dick
moore
none
of
us
knew
why
at
the
time
it
was
till
long
afterward
that
i
found
out
how
her
mother
had
worried
her
into
it
i
was
sure
there
was
something
wrong
though
because
i
knew
how
she
had
snubbed
him
time
and
again
and
it
was
like
leslie
to
turn
face
about
like
that
besides
i
knew
that
dick
moore
was
the
kind
of
man
leslie
could
ever
fancy
in
spite
of
his
good
looks
and
dashing
ways
of
course
there
was
no
wedding
but
rose
asked
me
to
go
and
see
them
married
i
went
but
i
was
sorry
i
did
i
seen
leslie
face
at
her
brother
funeral
and
at
her
father
funeral
and
now
it
seemed
to
me
i
was
seeing
it
at
her
own
funeral
but
rose
was
smiling
as
a
basket
of
chips
believe
me
leslie
and
dick
settled
down
on
the
west
place
rose
could
bear
to
part
with
her
dear
daughter
and
lived
there
for
the
winter
in
the
spring
rose
took
pneumonia
and
died
a
year
too
late
leslie
was
enough
over
it
is
it
terrible
the
way
some
unworthy
folks
are
loved
while
others
that
deserve
it
far
more
you
think
never
get
much
affection
as
for
dick
he
had
enough
of
quiet
married
life
just
like
a
man
he
was
for
up
and
off
he
went
over
to
nova
scotia
to
visit
his
relations
his
father
had
come
from
nova
scotia
and
he
wrote
back
to
leslie
that
his
cousin
george
moore
was
going
on
a
voyage
to
havana
and
he
was
going
too
the
name
of
the
vessel
was
the
four
sisters
and
they
were
to
be
gone
about
nine
weeks
it
must
have
been
a
relief
to
leslie
but
she
never
said
anything
from
the
day
of
her
marriage
she
was
just
what
she
is
now
cold
and
proud
and
keeping
everyone
but
me
at
a
distance
i
wo
be
kept
at
a
distance
believe
me
i
just
stuck
to
leslie
as
close
as
i
knew
how
in
spite
of
everything
she
told
me
you
were
the
best
friend
she
had
said
anne
did
she
exclaimed
miss
cornelia
delightedly
well
i
real
thankful
to
hear
it
sometimes
i
wondered
if
she
really
did
want
me
around
at
all
she
never
let
me
think
so
you
must
have
thawed
her
out
more
than
you
think
or
she
would
have
said
that
much
itself
to
you
oh
that
poor
girl
i
never
see
dick
moore
but
i
want
to
run
a
knife
clean
through
him
miss
cornelia
wiped
her
eyes
again
and
having
relieved
her
feelings
by
her
wish
took
up
her
tale
well
leslie
was
left
over
there
alone
dick
had
put
in
the
crop
before
he
went
and
old
abner
looked
after
it
the
summer
went
by
and
the
four
sisters
did
come
back
the
nova
scotia
moores
investigated
and
found
she
had
got
to
havana
and
discharged
her
cargo
and
took
on
another
and
left
for
home
and
that
was
all
they
ever
found
out
about
her
by
degrees
people
began
to
talk
of
dick
moore
as
one
that
was
dead
almost
everyone
believed
that
he
was
though
no
one
felt
certain
for
men
have
turned
up
here
at
the
harbor
after
been
gone
for
years
leslie
never
thought
he
was
dead
and
she
was
right
a
thousand
pities
too
the
next
summer
captain
jim
was
in
havana
that
was
before
he
gave
up
the
sea
of
course
he
thought
poke
round
a
bit
captain
jim
was
always
meddlesome
just
like
a
man
and
he
went
to
inquiring
round
among
the
sailors
boarding
houses
and
places
like
that
to
see
if
he
could
find
out
anything
about
the
crew
of
the
four
sisters
he
better
have
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
in
my
opinion
well
he
went
to
one
place
and
there
he
found
a
man
he
knew
at
first
sight
it
was
dick
moore
though
he
had
a
big
beard
captain
jim
got
it
shaved
off
and
then
there
was
no
doubt
dick
moore
it
was
his
body
at
least
his
mind
was
there
as
for
his
soul
in
my
opinion
he
never
had
one
what
had
happened
to
him
nobody
knows
the
rights
of
it
all
the
folks
who
kept
the
boarding
house
could
tell
was
that
about
a
year
before
they
had
found
him
lying
on
their
doorstep
one
morning
in
an
awful
condition
his
head
battered
to
a
jelly
almost
they
supposed
he
got
hurt
in
some
drunken
row
and
likely
that
the
truth
of
it
they
took
him
in
never
thinking
he
could
live
but
he
did
and
he
was
just
like
a
child
when
he
got
well
he
had
memory
or
intellect
or
reason
they
tried
to
find
out
who
he
was
but
they
never
could
he
could
even
tell
them
his
name
he
could
only
say
a
few
simple
words
he
had
a
letter
on
him
beginning
dick
and
signed
but
there
was
no
address
on
it
and
the
envelope
was
gone
they
let
him
stay
on
he
learned
to
do
a
few
odd
jobs
about
the
place
and
there
captain
jim
found
him
he
brought
him
home
i
always
said
it
was
a
bad
day
work
though
i
there
was
nothing
else
he
could
do
he
thought
maybe
when
dick
got
home
and
saw
his
old
surroundings
and
familiar
faces
his
memory
would
wake
up
but
it
had
any
effect
there
he
been
at
the
house
up
the
brook
ever
since
he
just
like
a
child
no
more
nor
less
takes
fractious
spells
occasionally
but
mostly
he
just
vacant
and
good
humored
and
harmless
he
apt
to
run
away
if
he
is
watched
that
the
burden
leslie
has
had
to
carry
for
eleven
years
and
all
alone
old
abner
moore
died
soon
after
dick
was
brought
home
and
it
was
found
he
was
almost
bankrupt
when
things
were
settled
up
there
was
nothing
for
leslie
and
dick
but
the
old
west
farm
leslie
rented
it
to
john
ward
and
the
rent
is
all
she
has
to
live
on
sometimes
in
summer
she
takes
a
boarder
to
help
out
but
most
visitors
prefer
the
other
side
of
the
harbor
where
the
hotels
and
summer
cottages
are
leslie
house
is
too
far
from
the
bathing
shore
she
taken
care
of
dick
and
she
never
been
away
from
him
for
eleven
years
she
tied
to
that
imbecile
for
life
and
after
all
the
dreams
and
hopes
she
once
had
you
can
imagine
what
it
has
been
like
for
her
anne
dearie
with
her
beauty
and
spirit
and
pride
and
cleverness
it
just
been
a
living
death
poor
poor
girl
said
anne
again
her
own
happiness
seemed
to
reproach
her
what
right
had
she
to
be
so
happy
when
another
human
soul
must
be
so
miserable
will
you
tell
me
just
what
leslie
said
and
how
she
acted
the
night
you
met
her
on
the
shore
asked
miss
cornelia
she
listened
intently
and
nodded
her
satisfaction
you
thought
she
was
stiff
and
cold
anne
dearie
but
i
can
tell
you
she
thawed
out
wonderful
for
her
she
must
have
taken
to
you
real
strong
i
so
glad
you
may
be
able
to
help
her
a
good
deal
i
was
thankful
when
i
heard
that
a
young
couple
was
coming
to
this
house
for
i
hoped
it
would
mean
some
friends
for
leslie
especially
if
you
belonged
to
the
race
that
knows
joseph
you
will
be
her
friend
you
anne
dearie
indeed
i
will
if
she
let
me
said
anne
with
all
her
own
sweet
impulsive
earnestness
no
you
must
be
her
friend
whether
she
let
you
or
not
said
miss
cornelia
resolutely
do
you
mind
if
she
stiff
by
times
notice
it
remember
what
her
life
has
been
and
is
and
must
always
be
i
suppose
for
creatures
like
dick
moore
live
forever
i
understand
you
should
see
how
fat
he
got
since
he
came
home
he
used
to
be
lean
enough
just
make
her
be
friends
you
can
do
it
you
one
of
those
who
have
the
knack
only
you
must
be
sensitive
and
do
mind
if
she
does
seem
to
want
you
to
go
over
there
much
she
knows
that
some
women
do
like
to
be
where
dick
is
they
complain
he
gives
them
the
creeps
just
get
her
to
come
over
here
as
often
as
she
can
she
ca
get
away
so
very
much
she
leave
dick
long
for
the
lord
knows
what
he
do
burn
the
house
down
most
likely
at
nights
after
he
in
bed
and
asleep
is
about
the
only
time
she
free
he
always
goes
to
bed
early
and
sleeps
like
the
dead
till
next
morning
that
is
how
you
came
to
meet
her
at
the
shore
likely
she
wanders
there
considerable
i
will
do
everything
i
can
for
her
said
anne
her
interest
in
leslie
moore
which
had
been
vivid
ever
since
she
had
seen
her
driving
her
geese
down
the
hill
was
intensified
a
thousand
fold
by
miss
cornelia
narration
the
girl
beauty
and
sorrow
and
loneliness
drew
her
with
an
irresistible
fascination
she
had
never
known
anyone
like
her
her
friends
had
hitherto
been
wholesome
normal
merry
girls
like
herself
with
only
the
average
trials
of
human
care
and
bereavement
to
shadow
their
girlish
dreams
leslie
moore
stood
apart
a
tragic
appealing
figure
of
thwarted
womanhood
anne
resolved
that
she
would
win
entrance
into
the
kingdom
of
that
lonely
soul
and
find
there
the
comradeship
it
could
so
richly
give
were
it
not
for
the
cruel
fetters
that
held
it
in
a
prison
not
of
its
own
making
and
mind
you
this
anne
dearie
said
miss
cornelia
who
had
not
yet
wholly
relieved
her
mind
you
must
think
leslie
is
an
infidel
because
she
hardly
ever
goes
to
church
or
even
that
she
a
methodist
she
ca
take
dick
to
church
of
course
not
that
he
ever
troubled
church
much
in
his
best
days
but
you
just
remember
that
she
a
real
strong
presbyterian
at
heart
anne
dearie
chapter
leslie
comes
over
leslie
came
over
to
the
house
of
dreams
one
frosty
october
night
when
moonlit
mists
were
hanging
over
the
harbor
and
curling
like
silver
ribbons
along
the
seaward
glens
she
looked
as
if
she
repented
coming
when
gilbert
answered
her
knock
but
anne
flew
past
him
pounced
on
her
and
drew
her
in
i
so
glad
you
picked
tonight
for
a
call
she
said
gaily
i
made
up
a
lot
of
extra
good
fudge
this
afternoon
and
we
want
someone
to
help
us
eat
it
before
the
fire
while
we
tell
stories
perhaps
captain
jim
will
drop
in
too
this
is
his
night
no
captain
jim
is
over
home
said
leslie
he
he
made
me
come
here
she
added
half
defiantly
i
say
a
to
him
for
that
when
i
see
him
said
anne
pulling
easy
chairs
before
the
fire
oh
i
do
mean
that
i
did
want
to
come
protested
leslie
flushing
a
little
i
i
been
thinking
of
coming
but
it
always
easy
for
me
to
get
away
of
course
it
must
be
hard
for
you
to
leave
moore
said
anne
in
a
tone
she
had
decided
that
it
would
be
best
to
mention
dick
moore
occasionally
as
an
accepted
fact
and
not
give
undue
morbidness
to
the
subject
by
avoiding
it
she
was
right
for
air
of
constraint
suddenly
vanished
evidently
she
had
been
wondering
how
much
anne
knew
of
the
conditions
of
her
life
and
was
relieved
that
no
explanations
were
needed
she
allowed
her
cap
and
jacket
to
be
taken
and
sat
down
with
a
girlish
snuggle
in
the
big
armchair
by
magog
she
was
dressed
prettily
and
carefully
with
the
customary
touch
of
color
in
the
scarlet
geranium
at
her
white
throat
her
beautiful
hair
gleamed
like
molten
gold
in
the
warm
firelight
her
eyes
were
full
of
soft
laughter
and
allurement
for
the
moment
under
the
influence
of
the
little
house
of
dreams
she
was
a
girl
again
a
girl
forgetful
of
the
past
and
its
bitterness
the
atmosphere
of
the
many
loves
that
had
sanctified
the
little
house
was
all
about
her
the
companionship
of
two
healthy
happy
young
folks
of
her
own
generation
encircled
her
she
felt
and
yielded
to
the
magic
of
her
surroundings
miss
cornelia
and
captain
jim
would
scarcely
have
recognized
her
anne
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
this
was
the
cold
unresponsive
woman
she
had
met
on
the
shore
this
animated
girl
who
talked
and
listened
with
the
eagerness
of
a
starved
soul
and
how
hungrily
leslie
eyes
looked
at
the
bookcases
between
the
windows
our
library
is
very
extensive
said
anne
but
every
book
in
it
is
a
friend
we
picked
our
books
up
through
the
years
here
and
there
never
buying
one
until
we
had
first
read
it
and
knew
that
it
belonged
to
the
race
of
joseph
leslie
laughed
beautiful
laughter
that
seemed
akin
to
all
the
mirth
that
had
echoed
through
the
little
house
in
the
vanished
years
i
have
a
few
books
of
father
not
many
she
said
i
read
them
until
i
know
them
almost
by
heart
i
do
get
many
books
there
a
circulating
library
at
the
glen
store
but
i
do
think
the
committee
who
pick
the
books
for
parker
know
what
books
are
of
race
or
perhaps
they
do
care
it
was
so
seldom
i
got
one
i
really
liked
that
i
gave
up
getting
any
i
hope
you
look
on
our
bookshelves
as
your
own
said
anne
you
are
entirely
and
wholeheartedly
welcome
to
the
loan
of
any
book
on
them
you
are
setting
a
feast
of
fat
things
before
me
said
leslie
joyously
then
as
the
clock
struck
ten
she
rose
half
unwillingly
i
must
go
i
did
realise
it
was
so
late
captain
jim
is
always
saying
it
does
take
long
to
stay
an
hour
but
i
stayed
two
and
oh
but
i
enjoyed
them
she
added
frankly
come
often
said
anne
and
gilbert
they
had
risen
and
stood
together
in
the
firelight
glow
leslie
looked
at
them
youthful
hopeful
happy
typifying
all
she
had
missed
and
must
forever
miss
the
light
went
out
of
her
face
and
eyes
the
girl
vanished
it
was
the
sorrowful
cheated
woman
who
answered
the
invitation
almost
coldly
and
got
herself
away
with
a
pitiful
haste
anne
watched
her
until
she
was
lost
in
the
shadows
of
the
chill
and
misty
night
then
she
turned
slowly
back
to
the
glow
of
her
own
radiant
hearthstone
is
she
lovely
gilbert
her
hair
fascinates
me
miss
cornelia
says
it
reaches
to
her
feet
ruby
gillis
had
beautiful
hair
but
leslie
is
alive
every
thread
of
it
is
living
gold
she
is
very
beautiful
agreed
gilbert
so
heartily
that
anne
almost
wished
he
were
a
little
less
enthusiastic
gilbert
would
you
like
my
hair
better
if
it
were
like
leslie
she
asked
wistfully
i
would
have
your
hair
any
color
but
just
what
it
is
for
the
world
said
gilbert
with
one
or
two
convincing
accompaniments
you
would
be
anne
if
you
had
golden
hair
or
hair
of
any
color
but
red
said
anne
with
gloomy
satisfaction
yes
red
to
give
warmth
to
that
skin
and
those
shining
eyes
of
yours
golden
hair
would
suit
you
at
all
queen
anne
my
queen
anne
queen
of
my
heart
and
life
and
home
then
you
may
admire
leslie
all
you
like
said
anne
magnanimously
chapter
a
ghostly
evening
one
evening
a
week
later
anne
decided
to
run
over
the
fields
to
the
house
up
the
brook
for
an
informal
call
it
was
an
evening
of
gray
fog
that
had
crept
in
from
the
gulf
swathed
the
harbor
filled
the
glens
and
valleys
and
clung
heavily
to
the
autumnal
meadows
through
it
the
sea
sobbed
and
shuddered
anne
saw
four
winds
in
a
new
aspect
and
found
it
weird
and
mysterious
and
fascinating
but
it
also
gave
her
a
little
feeling
of
loneliness
gilbert
was
away
and
would
be
away
until
the
morrow
attending
a
medical
in
charlottetown
anne
longed
for
an
hour
of
fellowship
with
some
girl
friend
captain
jim
and
miss
cornelia
were
good
fellows
each
in
their
own
way
but
youth
yearned
to
youth
if
only
diana
or
phil
or
pris
or
stella
could
drop
in
for
a
chat
she
said
to
herself
how
delightful
it
would
be
this
is
such
a
ghostly
night
i
sure
all
the
ships
that
ever
sailed
out
of
four
winds
to
their
doom
could
be
seen
tonight
sailing
up
the
harbor
with
their
drowned
crews
on
their
decks
if
that
shrouding
fog
could
suddenly
be
drawn
aside
i
feel
as
if
it
concealed
innumerable
mysteries
as
if
i
were
surrounded
by
the
wraiths
of
old
generations
of
four
winds
people
peering
at
me
through
that
gray
veil
if
ever
the
dear
dead
ladies
of
this
little
house
came
back
to
revisit
it
they
would
come
on
just
such
a
night
as
this
if
i
sit
here
any
longer
i
see
one
of
them
there
opposite
me
in
gilbert
chair
this
place
is
exactly
canny
tonight
even
gog
and
magog
have
an
air
of
pricking
up
their
ears
to
hear
the
footsteps
of
unseen
guests
i
run
over
to
see
leslie
before
i
frighten
myself
with
my
own
fancies
as
i
did
long
ago
in
the
matter
of
the
haunted
wood
i
leave
my
house
of
dreams
to
welcome
back
its
old
inhabitants
my
fire
will
give
them
my
and
greeting
they
will
be
gone
before
i
come
back
and
my
house
will
be
mine
once
more
tonight
i
am
sure
it
is
keeping
a
tryst
with
the
past
laughing
a
little
over
her
fancy
yet
with
something
of
a
creepy
sensation
in
the
region
of
her
spine
anne
kissed
her
hand
to
gog
and
magog
and
slipped
out
into
the
fog
with
some
of
the
new
magazines
under
her
arm
for
leslie
leslie
wild
for
books
and
magazines
miss
cornelia
had
told
her
and
she
hardly
ever
sees
one
she
ca
afford
to
buy
them
or
subscribe
for
them
she
really
pitifully
poor
anne
i
do
see
how
she
makes
out
to
live
at
all
on
the
little
rent
the
farm
brings
in
she
never
even
hints
a
complaint
on
the
score
of
poverty
but
i
know
what
it
must
be
she
been
handicapped
by
it
all
her
life
she
did
mind
it
when
she
was
free
and
ambitious
but
it
must
gall
now
believe
me
i
glad
she
seemed
so
bright
and
merry
the
evening
she
spent
with
you
captain
jim
told
me
he
had
fairly
to
put
her
cap
and
coat
on
and
push
her
out
of
the
door
do
be
too
long
going
to
see
her
either
if
you
are
she
think
it
because
you
do
like
the
sight
of
dick
and
she
crawl
into
her
shell
again
dick
a
great
big
harmless
baby
but
that
silly
grin
and
chuckle
of
his
do
get
on
some
people
nerves
thank
goodness
i
no
nerves
myself
i
like
dick
moore
better
now
than
i
ever
did
when
he
was
in
his
right
senses
though
the
lord
knows
that
is
saying
much
i
was
down
there
one
day
in
housecleaning
time
helping
leslie
a
bit
and
i
was
frying
doughnuts
dick
was
hanging
round
to
get
one
as
usual
and
all
at
once
he
picked
up
a
scalding
hot
one
i
just
fished
out
and
dropped
it
on
the
back
of
my
neck
when
i
was
bending
over
then
he
laughed
and
laughed
believe
me
anne
it
took
all
the
grace
of
god
in
my
heart
to
keep
me
from
just
whisking
up
that
of
boiling
fat
and
pouring
it
over
his
head
anne
laughed
over
miss
cornelia
wrath
as
she
sped
through
the
darkness
but
laughter
accorded
ill
with
that
night
she
was
sober
enough
when
she
reached
the
house
among
the
willows
everything
was
very
silent
the
front
part
of
the
house
seemed
dark
and
deserted
so
anne
slipped
round
to
the
side
door
which
opened
from
the
veranda
into
a
little
sitting
room
there
she
halted
noiselessly
the
door
was
open
beyond
in
the
dimly
lighted
room
sat
leslie
moore
with
her
arms
flung
out
on
the
table
and
her
head
bent
upon
them
she
was
weeping
horribly
with
low
fierce
choking
sobs
as
if
some
agony
in
her
soul
were
trying
to
tear
itself
out
an
old
black
dog
was
sitting
by
her
his
nose
resting
on
his
lap
his
big
doggish
eyes
full
of
mute
imploring
sympathy
and
devotion
anne
drew
back
in
dismay
she
felt
that
she
could
not
intermeddle
with
this
bitterness
her
heart
ached
with
a
sympathy
she
might
not
utter
to
go
in
now
would
be
to
shut
the
door
forever
on
any
possible
help
or
friendship
some
instinct
warned
anne
that
the
proud
bitter
girl
would
never
forgive
the
one
who
thus
surprised
her
in
her
abandonment
of
despair
anne
slipped
noiselessly
from
the
veranda
and
found
her
way
across
the
yard
beyond
she
heard
voices
in
the
gloom
and
saw
the
dim
glow
of
a
light
at
the
gate
she
met
two
men
captain
jim
with
a
lantern
and
another
who
she
knew
must
be
dick
moore
a
big
man
badly
gone
to
fat
with
a
broad
round
red
face
and
vacant
eyes
even
in
the
dull
light
anne
got
the
impression
that
there
was
something
unusual
about
his
eyes
is
this
you
mistress
blythe
said
captain
jim
now
now
you
had
oughter
be
roaming
about
alone
on
a
night
like
this
you
could
get
lost
in
this
fog
easier
than
not
jest
you
wait
till
i
see
dick
safe
inside
the
door
and
i
come
back
and
light
you
over
the
fields
i
ai
going
to
have
blythe
coming
home
and
finding
that
you
walked
clean
over
cape
leforce
in
the
fog
a
woman
did
that
once
forty
years
ago
so
you
been
over
to
see
leslie
he
said
when
he
rejoined
her
i
did
go
in
said
anne
and
told
what
she
had
seen
captain
jim
sighed
poor
poor
little
girl
she
do
cry
often
mistress
blythe
too
brave
for
that
she
must
feel
terrible
when
she
does
cry
a
night
like
this
is
hard
on
poor
women
who
have
sorrows
there
something
about
it
that
kinder
brings
up
all
we
suffered
or
feared
it
full
of
ghosts
said
anne
with
a
shiver
that
was
why
i
came
over
i
wanted
to
clasp
a
human
hand
and
hear
a
human
voice
there
seem
to
be
so
many
inhuman
presences
about
tonight
even
my
own
dear
house
was
full
of
them
they
fairly
elbowed
me
out
so
i
fled
over
here
for
companionship
of
my
kind
you
were
right
not
to
go
in
though
mistress
blythe
leslie
have
liked
it
she
would
have
liked
me
going
in
with
dick
as
have
done
if
i
had
met
you
i
had
dick
down
with
me
all
day
i
keep
him
with
me
as
much
as
i
can
to
help
leslie
a
bit
is
there
something
odd
about
his
eyes
asked
anne
you
noticed
that
yes
one
is
blue
and
is
hazel
his
father
had
the
same
it
a
moore
peculiarity
that
was
what
told
me
he
was
dick
moore
when
i
saw
him
first
down
in
cuby
if
it
had
for
his
eyes
i
might
him
with
his
beard
and
fat
you
know
i
reckon
that
it
was
me
found
him
and
brought
him
home
miss
cornelia
always
says
i
should
have
done
it
but
i
ca
agree
with
her
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
and
so
was
the
only
thing
there
ai
no
question
in
my
mind
about
that
but
my
old
heart
aches
for
leslie
she
only
and
she
eaten
more
bread
with
sorrow
than
most
women
do
in
eighty
years
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
little
while
presently
anne
said
do
you
know
captain
jim
i
never
like
walking
with
a
lantern
i
have
always
the
strangest
feeling
that
just
outside
the
circle
of
light
just
over
its
edge
in
the
darkness
i
am
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
furtive
sinister
things
watching
me
from
the
shadows
with
hostile
eyes
i
had
that
feeling
from
childhood
what
is
the
reason
i
never
feel
like
that
when
i
really
in
the
darkness
when
it
is
close
all
around
me
i
not
the
least
frightened
i
something
of
that
feeling
myself
admitted
captain
jim
i
reckon
when
the
darkness
is
close
to
us
it
is
a
friend
but
when
we
sorter
push
it
away
from
us
divorce
ourselves
from
it
so
to
speak
with
lantern
light
it
becomes
an
enemy
but
the
fog
is
lifting
there
a
smart
west
wind
rising
if
you
notice
the
stars
will
be
out
when
you
get
home
they
were
out
and
when
anne
her
house
of
dreams
the
red
embers
were
still
glowing
on
the
hearth
and
all
the
haunting
presences
were
gone
chapter
november
days
the
splendor
of
color
which
had
glowed
for
weeks
along
the
shores
of
four
winds
harbor
had
faded
out
into
the
soft
of
late
autumnal
hills
there
came
many
days
when
fields
and
shores
were
dim
with
misty
rain
or
shivering
before
the
breath
of
a
melancholy
nights
too
of
storm
and
tempest
when
anne
sometimes
wakened
to
pray
that
no
ship
might
be
beating
up
the
grim
north
shore
for
if
it
were
so
not
even
the
great
faithful
light
whirling
through
the
darkness
unafraid
could
avail
to
guide
it
into
safe
haven
in
november
i
sometimes
feel
as
if
spring
could
never
come
again
she
sighed
grieving
over
the
hopeless
unsightliness
of
her
frosted
and
bedraggled
the
gay
little
garden
of
the
bride
was
rather
a
forlorn
place
now
and
the
lombardies
and
birches
were
under
bare
poles
as
captain
jim
said
but
the
behind
the
little
house
was
forever
green
and
staunch
and
even
in
november
and
december
there
came
gracious
days
of
sunshine
and
purple
hazes
when
the
harbor
danced
and
sparkled
as
blithely
as
in
midsummer
and
the
gulf
was
so
softly
blue
and
tender
that
the
storm
and
the
wild
wind
seemed
only
things
of
a
dream
anne
and
gilbert
spent
many
an
autumn
evening
at
the
lighthouse
it
was
always
a
cheery
place
even
when
the
east
wind
sang
in
minor
and
the
sea
was
dead
and
gray
hints
of
sunshine
seemed
to
be
lurking
all
about
it
perhaps
this
was
because
the
first
mate
always
paraded
it
in
panoply
of
gold
he
was
so
large
and
effulgent
that
one
hardly
missed
the
sun
and
his
resounding
purrs
formed
a
pleasant
accompaniment
to
the
laughter
and
conversation
which
went
on
around
captain
fireplace
captain
jim
and
gilbert
had
many
long
discussions
and
high
converse
on
matters
beyond
the
ken
of
cat
or
king
i
like
to
ponder
on
all
kinds
of
problems
though
i
ca
solve
said
captain
jim
my
father
held
that
we
should
never
talk
of
things
we
could
understand
but
if
we
did
doctor
the
subjects
for
conversation
would
be
mighty
few
i
reckon
the
gods
laugh
many
a
time
to
hear
us
but
what
matters
so
long
as
we
remember
that
we
only
men
and
do
take
to
fancying
that
we
gods
ourselves
really
knowing
good
and
evil
i
reckon
our
wo
do
us
or
anyone
much
harm
so
let
have
another
whack
at
the
whence
why
and
whither
this
evening
doctor
while
they
whacked
anne
listened
or
dreamed
sometimes
leslie
went
to
the
lighthouse
with
them
and
she
and
anne
wandered
along
the
shore
in
the
eerie
twilight
or
sat
on
the
rocks
below
the
lighthouse
until
the
darkness
drove
them
back
to
the
cheer
of
the
driftwood
fire
then
captain
jim
would
brew
them
tea
and
tell
them
tales
of
land
and
sea
and
whatsoever
might
betide
the
great
forgotten
world
outside
leslie
seemed
always
to
enjoy
those
lighthouse
carousals
very
much
and
bloomed
out
for
the
time
being
into
ready
wit
and
beautiful
laughter
or
silence
there
was
a
certain
tang
and
savor
in
the
conversation
when
leslie
was
present
which
they
missed
when
she
was
absent
even
when
she
did
not
talk
she
seemed
to
inspire
others
to
brilliancy
captain
jim
told
his
stories
better
gilbert
was
quicker
in
argument
and
repartee
anne
felt
little
gushes
and
trickles
of
fancy
and
imagination
bubbling
to
her
lips
under
the
influence
of
personality
that
girl
was
born
to
be
a
leader
in
social
and
intellectual
circles
far
away
from
four
winds
she
said
to
gilbert
as
they
walked
home
one
night
she
just
wasted
here
wasted
were
you
listening
to
captain
jim
and
yours
truly
the
other
night
when
we
discussed
that
subject
generally
we
came
to
the
comforting
conclusion
that
the
creator
probably
knew
how
to
run
his
universe
quite
as
well
as
we
do
and
that
after
all
there
are
no
such
things
as
lives
saving
and
except
when
an
individual
wilfully
squanders
and
wastes
his
own
life
which
leslie
moore
certainly
has
done
and
some
people
might
think
that
a
redmond
whom
editors
were
beginning
to
honor
was
as
the
wife
of
a
struggling
country
doctor
in
the
rural
community
of
four
winds
gilbert
if
you
had
married
roy
gardner
now
continued
gilbert
mercilessly
you
could
have
been
leader
in
social
and
intellectual
circles
far
away
from
four
winds
gilbert
blythe
you
know
you
were
in
love
with
him
at
one
time
anne
gilbert
that
mean
mean
just
like
all
the
men
as
miss
cornelia
says
i
never
was
in
love
with
him
i
only
imagined
i
was
you
know
that
you
know
i
rather
be
your
wife
in
our
house
of
dreams
and
fulfillment
than
a
queen
in
a
palace
gilbert
answer
was
not
in
words
but
i
am
afraid
that
both
of
them
forgot
poor
leslie
speeding
her
lonely
way
across
the
fields
to
a
house
that
was
neither
a
palace
nor
the
fulfillment
of
a
dream
the
moon
was
rising
over
the
sad
dark
sea
behind
them
and
transfiguring
it
her
light
had
not
yet
reached
the
harbor
the
further
side
of
which
was
shadowy
and
suggestive
with
dim
coves
and
rich
glooms
and
jewelling
lights
how
the
home
lights
shine
out
tonight
through
the
dark
said
anne
that
string
of
them
over
the
harbor
looks
like
a
necklace
and
what
a
coruscation
there
is
up
at
the
glen
oh
look
gilbert
there
is
ours
i
so
glad
we
left
it
burning
i
hate
to
come
home
to
a
dark
house
our
homelight
gilbert
is
it
lovely
to
see
just
one
of
earth
many
millions
of
homes
anne
girl
but
ours
ours
our
beacon
in
naughty
world
when
a
fellow
has
a
home
and
a
dear
little
wife
in
it
what
more
need
he
ask
of
life
well
he
might
ask
one
thing
more
whispered
anne
happily
oh
gilbert
it
seems
as
if
i
just
could
wait
for
the
spring
chapter
christmas
at
four
winds
at
first
anne
and
gilbert
talked
of
going
home
to
avonlea
for
christmas
but
eventually
they
decided
to
stay
in
four
winds
i
want
to
spend
the
first
christmas
of
our
life
together
in
our
own
home
decreed
anne
so
it
fell
out
that
marilla
and
rachel
lynde
and
the
twins
came
to
four
winds
for
christmas
marilla
had
the
face
of
a
woman
who
had
circumnavigated
the
globe
she
had
never
been
sixty
miles
away
from
home
before
and
she
had
never
eaten
a
christmas
dinner
anywhere
save
at
green
gables
rachel
had
made
and
brought
with
her
an
enormous
plum
pudding
nothing
could
have
convinced
rachel
that
a
college
graduate
of
the
younger
generation
could
make
a
christmas
plum
pudding
properly
but
she
bestowed
approval
on
anne
house
anne
a
good
housekeeper
she
said
to
marilla
in
the
spare
room
the
night
of
their
arrival
i
looked
into
her
bread
box
and
her
scrap
pail
i
always
judge
a
housekeeper
by
those
that
what
nothing
in
the
pail
that
should
have
been
thrown
away
and
no
stale
pieces
in
the
bread
box
of
course
she
was
trained
up
with
you
but
then
she
went
to
college
afterwards
i
notice
she
got
my
tobacco
stripe
quilt
on
the
bed
here
and
that
big
round
braided
mat
of
yours
before
her
fire
it
makes
me
feel
right
at
home
anne
first
christmas
in
her
own
house
was
as
delightful
as
she
could
have
wished
the
day
was
fine
and
bright
the
first
skim
of
snow
had
fallen
on
christmas
eve
and
made
the
world
beautiful
the
harbor
was
still
open
and
glittering
captain
jim
and
miss
cornelia
came
to
dinner
leslie
and
dick
had
been
invited
but
leslie
made
excuse
they
always
went
to
her
uncle
isaac
west
for
christmas
she
said
she
rather
have
it
so
miss
cornelia
told
anne
she
ca
bear
taking
dick
where
there
are
strangers
christmas
is
always
a
hard
time
for
leslie
she
and
her
father
used
to
make
a
lot
of
it
miss
cornelia
and
rachel
did
not
take
a
very
violent
fancy
to
each
other
two
suns
hold
not
their
courses
in
one
sphere
but
they
did
not
clash
at
all
for
rachel
was
in
the
kitchen
helping
anne
and
marilla
with
the
dinner
and
it
fell
to
gilbert
to
entertain
captain
jim
and
miss
cornelia
or
rather
to
be
entertained
by
them
for
a
dialogue
between
those
two
old
friends
and
antagonists
was
assuredly
never
dull
it
many
a
year
since
there
was
a
christmas
dinner
here
mistress
blythe
said
captain
jim
miss
russell
always
went
to
her
friends
in
town
for
christmas
but
i
was
here
to
the
first
christmas
dinner
that
was
ever
eaten
in
this
house
and
the
schoolmaster
bride
cooked
it
that
was
sixty
years
ago
today
mistress
blythe
and
a
day
very
like
this
just
enough
snow
to
make
the
hills
white
and
the
harbor
as
blue
as
june
i
was
only
a
lad
and
i
never
been
invited
out
to
dinner
before
and
i
was
too
shy
to
eat
enough
i
got
all
over
that
most
men
do
said
miss
cornelia
sewing
furiously
miss
cornelia
was
not
going
to
sit
with
idle
hands
even
on
christmas
babies
come
without
any
consideration
for
holidays
and
there
was
one
expected
in
a
household
at
glen
mary
miss
cornelia
had
sent
that
household
a
substantial
dinner
for
its
little
swarm
and
so
meant
to
eat
her
own
with
a
comfortable
conscience
well
you
know
the
way
to
a
man
heart
is
through
his
stomach
cornelia
explained
captain
jim
i
believe
you
when
he
has
a
heart
retorted
miss
cornelia
i
suppose
that
why
so
many
women
kill
themselves
cooking
just
as
poor
amelia
baxter
did
she
died
last
christmas
morning
and
she
said
it
was
the
first
christmas
since
she
was
married
that
she
did
have
to
cook
a
big
dinner
it
must
have
been
a
real
pleasant
change
for
her
well
she
been
dead
a
year
so
you
soon
hear
of
horace
baxter
taking
notice
i
heard
he
was
taking
notice
already
said
captain
jim
winking
at
gilbert
was
he
up
to
your
place
one
sunday
lately
with
his
funeral
blacks
on
and
a
boiled
collar
no
he
was
and
he
need
come
neither
i
could
have
had
him
long
ago
when
he
was
fresh
i
do
want
any
goods
believe
me
as
for
horace
baxter
he
was
in
financial
difficulties
a
year
ago
last
summer
and
he
prayed
to
the
lord
for
help
and
when
his
wife
died
and
he
got
her
life
insurance
he
said
he
believed
it
was
the
answer
to
his
prayer
was
that
like
a
man
have
you
really
proof
that
he
said
that
cornelia
i
have
the
methodist
minister
word
for
it
if
you
call
that
proof
robert
baxter
told
me
the
same
thing
too
but
i
admit
that
evidence
robert
baxter
is
often
known
to
tell
the
truth
come
come
cornelia
i
think
he
generally
tells
the
truth
but
he
changes
his
opinion
so
often
it
sometimes
sounds
as
if
he
did
it
sounds
like
it
mighty
often
believe
me
but
trust
one
man
to
excuse
another
i
have
no
use
for
robert
baxter
he
turned
methodist
just
because
the
presbyterian
choir
happened
to
be
singing
the
bridegroom
cometh
for
a
collection
piece
when
him
and
margaret
walked
up
the
aisle
the
sunday
after
they
were
married
served
him
right
for
being
late
he
always
insisted
the
choir
did
it
on
purpose
to
insult
him
as
if
he
was
of
that
much
importance
but
that
family
always
thought
they
were
much
bigger
potatoes
than
they
really
were
his
brother
eliphalet
imagined
the
devil
was
always
at
his
elbow
but
never
believed
the
devil
wasted
that
much
time
on
him
i
do
know
said
captain
jim
thoughtfully
eliphalet
baxter
lived
too
much
alone
had
even
a
cat
or
dog
to
keep
him
human
when
a
man
is
alone
he
mighty
apt
to
be
with
the
devil
if
he
ai
with
god
he
has
to
choose
which
company
he
keep
i
reckon
if
the
devil
always
was
at
life
baxter
elbow
it
must
have
been
because
life
liked
to
have
him
there
said
miss
cornelia
and
subsided
into
silence
over
a
complicated
arrangement
of
tucks
until
captain
jim
deliberately
stirred
her
up
again
by
remarking
in
a
casual
way
i
was
up
to
the
methodist
church
last
sunday
morning
you
better
have
been
home
reading
your
bible
was
miss
retort
come
now
cornelia
ca
see
any
harm
in
going
to
the
methodist
church
when
there
no
preaching
in
your
own
i
been
a
presbyterian
for
years
and
it
is
likely
my
theology
will
hoist
anchor
at
this
late
day
it
setting
a
bad
example
said
miss
cornelia
grimly
besides
continued
wicked
captain
jim
i
wanted
to
hear
some
good
singing
the
methodists
have
a
good
choir
and
you
ca
deny
cornelia
that
the
singing
in
our
church
is
awful
since
the
split
in
the
choir
what
if
the
singing
is
good
they
doing
their
best
and
god
sees
no
difference
between
the
voice
of
a
crow
and
the
voice
of
a
nightingale
come
come
cornelia
said
captain
jim
mildly
i
a
better
opinion
of
the
almighty
ear
for
music
than
that
what
caused
the
trouble
in
our
choir
asked
gilbert
who
was
suffering
from
suppressed
laughter
it
dates
back
to
the
new
church
three
years
ago
answered
captain
jim
we
had
a
fearful
time
over
the
building
of
that
church
fell
out
over
the
question
of
a
new
site
the
two
sites
was
two
hundred
yards
apart
but
you
have
thought
they
was
a
thousand
by
the
bitterness
of
that
fight
we
was
split
up
into
three
factions
one
wanted
the
east
site
and
one
the
south
and
one
held
to
the
old
it
was
fought
out
in
bed
and
at
board
and
in
church
and
at
market
all
the
old
scandals
of
three
generations
were
dragged
out
of
their
graves
and
aired
three
matches
was
broken
up
by
it
and
the
meetings
we
had
to
try
to
settle
the
question
cornelia
will
you
ever
forget
the
one
when
old
luther
burns
got
up
and
made
a
speech
he
stated
his
opinions
forcibly
call
a
spade
a
spade
captain
you
mean
he
got
and
raked
them
all
fore
and
aft
they
deserved
it
too
a
pack
of
incapables
but
what
would
you
expect
of
a
committee
of
men
that
building
committee
held
meetings
and
at
the
end
of
the
were
no
nearer
having
a
church
than
when
they
begun
not
so
near
for
a
fact
for
in
one
fit
of
hurrying
things
along
they
gone
to
work
and
tore
the
old
church
down
so
there
we
were
without
a
church
and
no
place
but
the
hall
to
worship
in
the
methodists
offered
us
their
church
cornelia
the
glen
mary
church
would
have
been
built
to
this
day
went
on
miss
cornelia
ignoring
captain
jim
if
we
women
had
just
started
in
and
took
charge
we
said
we
meant
to
have
a
church
if
the
men
meant
to
quarrel
till
doomsday
and
we
were
tired
of
being
a
for
the
methodists
we
held
one
meeting
and
elected
a
committee
and
canvassed
for
subscriptions
we
got
them
too
when
any
of
the
men
tried
to
sass
us
we
told
them
they
tried
for
two
years
to
build
a
church
and
it
was
our
turn
now
we
shut
them
up
close
believe
me
and
in
six
months
we
had
our
church
of
course
when
the
men
saw
we
were
determined
they
stopped
fighting
and
went
to
work
as
soon
as
they
saw
they
had
to
or
quit
bossing
oh
women
ca
preach
or
be
elders
but
they
can
build
churches
and
scare
up
the
money
for
them
the
methodists
allow
women
to
preach
said
captain
jim
miss
cornelia
glared
at
him
i
never
said
the
methodists
had
common
sense
captain
what
i
say
is
i
doubt
if
they
have
much
religion
i
suppose
you
are
in
favor
of
votes
for
women
miss
cornelia
said
gilbert
i
not
hankering
after
the
vote
believe
me
said
miss
cornelia
scornfully
know
what
it
is
to
clean
up
after
the
men
but
some
of
these
days
when
the
men
realize
they
got
the
world
into
a
mess
they
ca
get
it
out
of
they
be
glad
to
give
us
the
vote
and
shoulder
their
troubles
over
on
us
that
their
scheme
oh
well
that
women
are
patient
believe
me
what
about
job
suggested
captain
jim
job
it
was
such
a
rare
thing
to
find
a
patient
man
that
when
one
was
really
discovered
they
were
determined
he
should
be
forgotten
retorted
miss
cornelia
triumphantly
anyhow
the
virtue
does
go
with
the
name
there
never
was
such
an
impatient
man
born
as
old
job
taylor
over
harbor
well
you
know
he
had
a
good
deal
to
try
him
cornelia
even
you
ca
defend
his
wife
i
always
remember
what
old
william
macallister
said
of
her
at
her
funeral
nae
doot
she
was
a
chreestian
wumman
but
she
had
the
own
temper
i
suppose
she
was
trying
admitted
miss
cornelia
reluctantly
but
that
did
justify
what
job
said
when
she
died
he
rode
home
from
the
graveyard
the
day
of
the
funeral
with
my
father
he
never
said
a
word
till
they
got
near
home
then
he
heaved
a
big
sigh
and
said
may
not
believe
it
stephen
but
this
is
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
was
that
like
a
man
i
poor
old
job
did
make
life
kinder
uneasy
for
him
reflected
captain
jim
well
there
such
a
thing
as
decency
is
there
even
if
a
man
is
rejoicing
in
his
heart
over
his
wife
being
dead
he
need
proclaim
it
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
and
happy
day
or
not
job
taylor
long
in
marrying
again
you
might
notice
his
second
wife
could
manage
him
she
made
him
walk
spanish
believe
me
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
make
him
hustle
round
and
put
up
a
tombstone
to
the
first
job
and
she
had
a
place
left
on
it
for
her
own
name
she
said
be
nobody
to
make
job
put
up
a
monument
to
her
speaking
of
taylors
how
is
lewis
taylor
up
at
the
glen
doctor
asked
captain
jim
she
getting
better
slowly
but
she
has
to
work
too
hard
replied
gilbert
her
husband
works
hard
too
raising
prize
pigs
said
miss
cornelia
he
noted
for
his
beautiful
pigs
he
a
heap
prouder
of
his
pigs
than
of
his
children
but
then
to
be
sure
his
pigs
are
the
best
pigs
possible
while
his
children
do
amount
to
much
he
picked
a
poor
mother
for
them
and
starved
her
while
she
was
bearing
and
rearing
them
his
pigs
got
the
cream
and
his
children
got
the
skim
milk
there
are
times
cornelia
when
i
have
to
agree
with
you
though
it
hurts
me
said
captain
jim
that
just
exactly
the
truth
about
lewis
taylor
when
i
see
those
poor
miserable
children
of
his
robbed
of
all
children
ought
to
have
it
my
own
bite
and
sup
for
days
afterwards
gilbert
went
out
to
the
kitchen
in
response
to
anne
beckoning
anne
shut
the
door
and
gave
him
a
connubial
lecture
gilbert
you
and
captain
jim
must
stop
baiting
miss
cornelia
oh
i
been
listening
to
you
and
i
just
wo
allow
it
miss
cornelia
is
enjoying
herself
hugely
you
know
she
is
well
never
mind
you
two
need
egg
her
on
like
that
dinner
is
ready
now
and
gilbert
do
let
rachel
carve
the
geese
i
know
she
means
to
offer
to
do
it
because
she
does
think
you
can
do
it
properly
show
her
you
can
i
ought
to
be
able
to
i
been
studying
diagrams
of
carving
for
the
past
month
said
gilbert
only
do
talk
to
me
while
doing
it
anne
for
if
you
drive
the
letters
out
of
my
head
i
be
in
a
worse
predicament
than
you
were
in
old
geometry
days
when
the
teacher
changed
them
gilbert
carved
the
geese
beautifully
even
rachel
had
to
admit
that
and
everybody
ate
of
them
and
enjoyed
them
anne
first
christmas
dinner
was
a
great
success
and
she
beamed
with
housewifely
pride
merry
was
the
feast
and
long
and
when
it
was
over
they
gathered
around
the
cheer
of
the
red
hearth
flame
and
captain
jim
told
them
stories
until
the
red
sun
swung
low
over
four
winds
harbor
and
the
long
blue
shadows
of
the
lombardies
fell
across
the
snow
in
the
lane
i
must
be
getting
back
to
the
light
he
said
finally
i
jest
have
time
to
walk
home
before
sundown
thank
you
for
a
beautiful
christmas
mistress
blythe
bring
master
davy
down
to
the
light
some
night
before
he
goes
home
i
want
to
see
those
stone
gods
said
davy
with
a
relish
chapter
new
year
eve
at
the
light
the
green
gables
folk
went
home
after
christmas
marilla
under
solemn
covenant
to
return
for
a
month
in
the
spring
more
snow
came
before
new
year
and
the
harbor
froze
over
but
the
gulf
still
was
free
beyond
the
white
imprisoned
fields
the
last
day
of
the
old
year
was
one
of
those
bright
cold
dazzling
winter
days
which
bombard
us
with
their
brilliancy
and
command
our
admiration
but
never
our
love
the
sky
was
sharp
and
blue
the
snow
diamonds
sparkled
insistently
the
stark
trees
were
bare
and
shameless
with
a
kind
of
brazen
beauty
the
hills
shot
assaulting
lances
of
crystal
even
the
shadows
were
sharp
and
stiff
and
as
no
proper
shadows
should
be
everything
that
was
handsome
seemed
ten
times
handsomer
and
less
attractive
in
the
glaring
splendor
and
everything
that
was
ugly
seemed
ten
times
uglier
and
everything
was
either
handsome
or
ugly
there
was
no
soft
blending
or
kind
obscurity
or
elusive
mistiness
in
that
searching
glitter
the
only
things
that
held
their
own
individuality
were
the
firs
for
the
fir
is
the
tree
of
mystery
and
shadow
and
yields
never
to
the
encroachments
of
crude
radiance
but
finally
the
day
began
to
realise
that
she
was
growing
old
then
a
certain
pensiveness
fell
over
her
beauty
which
dimmed
yet
intensified
it
sharp
angles
glittering
points
melted
away
into
curves
and
enticing
gleams
the
white
harbor
put
on
soft
grays
and
pinks
the
hills
turned
amethyst
the
old
year
is
going
away
beautifully
said
anne
she
and
leslie
and
gilbert
were
on
their
way
to
the
four
winds
point
having
plotted
with
captain
jim
to
watch
the
new
year
in
at
the
light
the
sun
had
set
and
in
the
southwestern
sky
hung
venus
glorious
and
golden
having
drawn
as
near
to
her
as
is
possible
for
her
for
the
first
time
anne
and
gilbert
saw
the
shadow
cast
by
that
brilliant
star
of
evening
that
faint
mysterious
shadow
never
seen
save
when
there
is
white
snow
to
reveal
it
and
then
only
with
averted
vision
vanishing
when
you
gaze
at
it
directly
it
like
the
spirit
of
a
shadow
is
it
whispered
anne
you
can
see
it
so
plainly
haunting
your
side
when
you
look
ahead
but
when
you
turn
and
look
at
it
it
gone
i
have
heard
that
you
can
see
the
shadow
of
venus
only
once
in
a
lifetime
and
that
within
a
year
of
seeing
it
your
life
most
wonderful
gift
will
come
to
you
said
leslie
but
she
spoke
rather
hardly
perhaps
she
thought
that
even
the
shadow
of
venus
could
bring
her
no
gift
of
life
anne
smiled
in
the
soft
twilight
she
felt
quite
sure
what
the
mystic
shadow
promised
her
they
found
marshall
elliott
at
the
lighthouse
at
first
anne
felt
inclined
to
resent
the
intrusion
of
this
eccentric
into
the
familiar
little
circle
but
marshall
elliott
soon
proved
his
legitimate
claim
to
membership
in
the
household
of
joseph
he
was
a
witty
intelligent
man
rivalling
captain
jim
himself
in
the
knack
of
telling
a
good
story
they
were
all
glad
when
he
agreed
to
watch
the
old
year
out
with
them
captain
jim
small
nephew
joe
had
come
down
to
spend
new
year
with
his
and
had
fallen
asleep
on
the
sofa
with
the
first
mate
curled
up
in
a
huge
golden
ball
at
his
feet
ai
he
a
dear
little
man
said
captain
jim
gloatingly
i
do
love
to
watch
a
little
child
asleep
mistress
blythe
it
the
most
beautiful
sight
in
the
world
i
reckon
joe
does
love
to
get
down
here
for
a
night
because
i
have
him
sleep
with
me
at
home
he
has
to
sleep
with
the
other
two
boys
and
he
does
like
it
why
ca
i
sleep
with
father
uncle
jim
says
he
in
the
bible
slept
with
their
fathers
as
for
the
questions
he
asks
the
minister
himself
could
answer
them
they
fair
swamp
me
jim
if
i
was
me
who
i
be
and
jim
what
would
happen
if
god
died
he
fired
them
two
off
at
me
tonight
afore
he
went
to
sleep
as
for
his
imagination
it
sails
away
from
everything
he
makes
up
the
most
remarkable
yarns
and
then
his
mother
shuts
him
up
in
the
closet
for
telling
stories
and
he
sits
down
and
makes
up
another
one
and
has
it
ready
to
relate
to
her
when
she
lets
him
out
he
had
one
for
me
when
he
come
down
tonight
jim
says
he
solemn
as
a
tombstone
had
a
in
the
glen
today
what
was
it
says
i
expecting
something
quite
startling
but
nowise
prepared
for
what
i
really
got
met
a
wolf
in
the
street
says
he
wolf
with
a
big
red
mouf
and
awful
long
teeth
uncle
jim
did
know
there
was
any
wolves
up
at
the
glen
says
i
he
comed
there
from
far
far
away
says
joe
i
fought
he
was
going
to
eat
me
up
uncle
jim
you
scared
says
i
i
had
a
big
gun
says
joe
i
shot
the
wolf
dead
uncle
jim
solid
dead
and
then
he
went
up
to
heaven
and
bit
god
says
he
well
i
was
fair
staggered
mistress
blythe
the
hours
bloomed
into
mirth
around
the
driftwood
fire
captain
jim
told
tales
and
marshall
elliott
sang
old
scotch
ballads
in
a
fine
tenor
voice
finally
captain
jim
took
down
his
old
brown
fiddle
from
the
wall
and
began
to
play
he
had
a
tolerable
knack
of
fiddling
which
all
appreciated
save
the
first
mate
who
sprang
from
the
sofa
as
if
he
had
been
shot
emitted
a
shriek
of
protest
and
fled
wildly
up
the
stairs
ca
cultivate
an
ear
for
music
in
that
cat
nohow
said
captain
jim
he
wo
stay
long
enough
to
learn
to
like
it
when
we
got
the
organ
up
at
the
glen
church
old
elder
richards
bounced
up
from
his
seat
the
minute
the
organist
began
to
play
and
scuttled
down
the
aisle
and
out
of
the
church
at
the
rate
of
it
reminded
me
so
strong
of
the
first
mate
tearing
loose
as
soon
as
i
begin
to
fiddle
that
i
come
nearer
to
laughing
out
loud
in
church
than
i
ever
did
before
or
since
there
was
something
so
infectious
in
the
rollicking
tunes
which
captain
jim
played
that
very
soon
marshall
elliott
feet
began
to
twitch
he
had
been
a
noted
dancer
in
his
youth
presently
he
started
up
and
held
out
his
hands
to
leslie
instantly
she
responded
round
and
round
the
firelit
room
they
circled
with
a
rhythmic
grace
that
was
wonderful
leslie
danced
like
one
inspired
the
wild
sweet
abandon
of
the
music
seemed
to
have
entered
into
and
possessed
her
anne
watched
her
in
fascinated
admiration
she
had
never
seen
her
like
this
all
the
innate
richness
and
color
and
charm
of
her
nature
seemed
to
have
broken
loose
and
overflowed
in
crimson
cheek
and
glowing
eye
and
grace
of
motion
even
the
aspect
of
marshall
elliott
with
his
long
beard
and
hair
could
not
spoil
the
picture
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
to
enhance
it
marshall
elliott
looked
like
a
viking
of
elder
days
dancing
with
one
of
the
daughters
of
the
northland
the
purtiest
dancing
i
ever
saw
and
i
seen
some
in
my
time
declared
captain
jim
when
at
last
the
bow
fell
from
his
tired
hand
leslie
dropped
into
her
chair
laughing
breathless
i
love
dancing
she
said
apart
to
anne
i
have
danced
since
i
was
sixteen
but
i
love
it
the
music
seems
to
run
through
my
veins
like
quicksilver
and
i
forget
everything
everything
except
the
delight
of
keeping
time
to
it
there
is
any
floor
beneath
me
or
walls
about
me
or
roof
over
me
i
floating
amid
the
stars
captain
jim
hung
his
fiddle
up
in
its
place
beside
a
large
frame
enclosing
several
banknotes
is
there
anybody
else
of
your
acquaintance
who
can
afford
to
hang
his
walls
with
banknotes
for
pictures
he
asked
there
twenty
notes
there
not
worth
the
glass
over
them
they
old
bank
of
island
notes
had
them
by
me
when
the
bank
failed
and
i
had
framed
and
hung
up
partly
as
a
reminder
not
to
put
your
trust
in
banks
and
partly
to
give
me
a
real
luxurious
millionairy
feeling
hullo
matey
do
be
scared
you
can
come
back
now
the
music
and
revelry
is
over
for
tonight
the
old
year
has
just
another
hour
to
stay
with
us
i
seen
new
years
come
in
over
that
gulf
yonder
mistress
blythe
you
see
a
hundred
said
marshall
elliott
captain
jim
shook
his
head
no
and
i
do
want
to
at
least
i
think
i
do
death
grows
friendlier
as
we
grow
older
not
that
one
of
us
really
wants
to
die
though
marshall
tennyson
spoke
truth
when
he
said
that
there
old
wallace
up
at
the
glen
she
had
heaps
of
trouble
all
her
life
poor
soul
and
she
lost
almost
everyone
she
cared
about
always
saying
that
she
be
glad
when
her
time
comes
and
she
want
to
sojourn
any
longer
in
this
vale
of
tears
but
when
she
takes
a
sick
spell
there
a
fuss
doctors
from
town
and
a
trained
nurse
and
enough
medicine
to
kill
a
dog
life
may
be
a
vale
of
tears
all
right
but
there
are
some
folks
who
enjoy
weeping
i
reckon
they
spent
the
old
year
last
hour
quietly
around
the
fire
a
few
minutes
before
twelve
captain
jim
rose
and
opened
the
door
we
must
let
the
new
year
in
he
said
outside
was
a
fine
blue
night
a
sparkling
ribbon
of
moonlight
garlanded
the
gulf
inside
the
bar
the
harbor
shone
like
a
pavement
of
pearl
they
stood
before
the
door
and
waited
captain
jim
with
his
ripe
full
experience
marshall
elliott
in
his
vigorous
but
empty
middle
life
gilbert
and
anne
with
their
precious
memories
and
exquisite
hopes
leslie
with
her
record
of
starved
years
and
her
hopeless
future
the
clock
on
the
little
shelf
above
the
fireplace
struck
twelve
welcome
new
year
said
captain
jim
bowing
low
as
the
last
stroke
died
away
i
wish
you
all
the
best
year
of
your
lives
mates
i
reckon
that
whatever
the
new
year
brings
us
will
be
the
best
the
great
captain
has
for
us
and
somehow
or
other
we
all
make
port
in
a
good
harbor
chapter
a
four
winds
winter
winter
set
in
vigorously
after
new
year
big
white
drifts
heaped
themselves
about
the
little
house
and
palms
of
frost
covered
its
windows
the
harbor
ice
grew
harder
and
thicker
until
the
four
winds
people
began
their
usual
winter
travelling
over
it
the
safe
ways
were
bushed
by
a
benevolent
government
and
night
and
day
the
gay
tinkle
of
the
sounded
on
it
on
moonlit
nights
anne
heard
them
in
her
house
of
dreams
like
fairy
chimes
the
gulf
froze
over
and
the
four
winds
light
flashed
no
more
during
the
months
when
navigation
was
closed
captain
jim
office
was
a
sinecure
the
first
mate
and
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
till
spring
except
keep
warm
and
amuse
ourselves
the
last
lighthouse
keeper
used
always
to
move
up
to
the
glen
in
winter
but
i
rather
stay
at
the
point
the
first
mate
might
get
poisoned
or
chewed
up
by
dogs
at
the
glen
it
a
mite
lonely
to
be
sure
with
neither
the
light
nor
the
water
for
company
but
if
our
friends
come
to
see
us
often
we
weather
it
through
captain
jim
had
an
ice
boat
and
many
a
wild
glorious
spin
gilbert
and
anne
and
leslie
had
over
the
glib
harbor
ice
with
him
anne
and
leslie
took
long
snowshoe
tramps
together
too
over
the
fields
or
across
the
harbor
after
storms
or
through
the
woods
beyond
the
glen
they
were
very
good
comrades
in
their
rambles
and
their
fireside
communings
each
had
something
to
give
the
other
each
felt
life
the
richer
for
friendly
exchange
of
thought
and
friendly
silence
each
looked
across
the
white
fields
between
their
homes
with
a
pleasant
consciousness
of
a
friend
beyond
but
in
spite
of
all
this
anne
felt
that
there
was
always
a
barrier
between
leslie
and
herself
a
constraint
that
never
wholly
vanished
i
do
know
why
i
ca
get
closer
to
her
anne
said
one
evening
to
captain
jim
i
like
her
so
much
i
admire
her
so
much
i
want
to
take
her
right
into
my
heart
and
creep
right
into
hers
but
i
can
never
cross
the
barrier
you
been
too
happy
all
your
life
mistress
blythe
said
captain
jim
thoughtfully
i
reckon
that
why
you
and
leslie
ca
get
real
close
together
in
your
souls
the
barrier
between
you
is
her
experience
of
sorrow
and
trouble
she
ai
responsible
for
it
and
you
ai
but
it
there
and
neither
of
you
can
cross
it
my
childhood
was
very
happy
before
i
came
to
green
gables
said
anne
gazing
soberly
out
of
the
window
at
the
still
sad
dead
beauty
of
the
leafless
on
the
moonlit
snow
mebbe
not
but
it
was
just
the
usual
unhappiness
of
a
child
who
anyone
to
look
after
it
properly
there
has
been
any
tragedy
in
your
life
mistress
blythe
and
poor
leslie
has
been
almost
all
tragedy
she
feels
i
reckon
though
mebbe
she
hardly
knows
she
feels
it
that
there
a
vast
deal
in
her
life
you
ca
enter
nor
understand
and
so
she
has
to
keep
you
back
from
it
hold
you
off
so
to
speak
from
hurting
her
you
know
if
we
got
anything
about
us
that
hurts
we
shrink
from
anyone
touch
on
or
near
it
it
holds
good
with
our
souls
as
well
as
our
bodies
i
reckon
leslie
soul
must
be
near
raw
it
no
wonder
she
hides
it
away
if
that
were
really
all
i
would
mind
captain
jim
i
would
understand
but
there
are
times
not
always
but
now
and
again
when
i
almost
have
to
believe
that
leslie
does
does
like
me
sometimes
i
surprise
a
look
in
her
eyes
that
seems
to
show
resentment
and
dislike
it
goes
so
quickly
but
i
seen
it
i
sure
of
that
and
it
hurts
me
captain
jim
i
not
used
to
being
disliked
and
tried
so
hard
to
win
leslie
friendship
you
have
won
it
mistress
blythe
do
you
go
cherishing
any
foolish
notion
that
leslie
do
like
you
if
she
did
she
would
have
anything
to
do
with
you
much
less
chumming
with
you
as
she
does
i
know
leslie
moore
too
well
not
to
be
sure
of
that
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
her
driving
her
geese
down
the
hill
on
the
day
i
came
to
four
winds
she
looked
at
me
with
the
same
expression
persisted
anne
i
felt
it
even
in
the
midst
of
my
admiration
of
her
beauty
she
looked
at
me
resentfully
she
did
indeed
captain
jim
the
resentment
must
have
been
about
something
else
mistress
blythe
and
you
jest
come
in
for
a
share
of
it
because
you
happened
past
leslie
does
take
sullen
spells
now
and
again
poor
girl
i
ca
blame
her
when
i
know
what
she
has
to
put
up
with
i
do
know
why
permitted
the
doctor
and
i
have
talked
a
lot
abut
the
origin
of
evil
but
we
have
quite
found
out
all
about
it
yet
there
a
vast
of
onunderstandable
things
in
life
ai
there
mistress
blythe
sometimes
things
seem
to
work
out
real
same
as
with
you
and
the
doctor
and
then
again
they
all
seem
to
go
catawampus
there
leslie
so
clever
and
beautiful
you
think
she
was
meant
for
a
queen
and
instead
she
cooped
up
over
there
robbed
of
almost
everything
a
woman
value
with
no
prospect
except
waiting
on
dick
moore
all
her
life
though
mind
you
mistress
blythe
i
daresay
choose
her
life
now
such
as
it
is
rather
than
the
life
she
lived
with
dick
before
he
went
away
that
something
a
clumsy
old
tongue
must
meddle
with
but
you
helped
leslie
a
lot
she
a
different
creature
since
you
come
to
four
winds
us
old
friends
see
the
difference
in
her
as
you
ca
miss
cornelia
and
me
was
talking
it
over
the
other
day
and
it
one
of
the
mighty
few
that
we
see
eye
to
eye
on
so
jest
you
throw
overboard
any
idea
of
her
not
liking
you
anne
could
hardly
discard
it
completely
for
there
were
undoubtedly
times
when
she
felt
with
an
instinct
that
was
not
to
be
combated
by
reason
that
leslie
harbored
a
queer
indefinable
resentment
towards
her
at
times
this
secret
consciousness
marred
the
delight
of
their
comradeship
at
others
it
was
almost
forgotten
but
anne
always
felt
the
hidden
thorn
was
there
and
might
prick
her
at
any
moment
she
felt
a
cruel
sting
from
it
on
the
day
when
she
told
leslie
of
what
she
hoped
the
spring
would
bring
to
the
little
house
of
dreams
leslie
looked
at
her
with
hard
bitter
unfriendly
eyes
so
you
are
to
have
that
too
she
said
in
a
choked
voice
and
without
another
word
she
had
turned
and
gone
across
the
fields
homeward
anne
was
deeply
hurt
for
the
moment
she
felt
as
if
she
could
never
like
leslie
again
but
when
leslie
came
over
a
few
evenings
later
she
was
so
pleasant
so
friendly
so
frank
and
witty
and
winsome
that
anne
was
charmed
into
forgiveness
and
forgetfulness
only
she
never
mentioned
her
darling
hope
to
leslie
again
nor
did
leslie
ever
refer
to
it
but
one
evening
when
late
winter
was
listening
for
the
word
of
spring
she
came
over
to
the
little
house
for
a
twilight
chat
and
when
she
went
away
she
left
a
small
white
box
on
the
table
anne
found
it
after
she
was
gone
and
opened
it
wonderingly
in
it
was
a
tiny
white
dress
of
exquisite
workmanship
delicate
embroidery
wonderful
tucking
sheer
loveliness
every
stitch
in
it
was
handwork
and
the
little
frills
of
lace
at
neck
and
sleeves
were
of
real
valenciennes
lying
on
it
was
a
card
with
leslie
love
what
hours
of
work
she
must
have
put
on
it
said
anne
and
the
material
must
have
cost
more
than
she
could
really
afford
it
is
very
sweet
of
her
but
leslie
was
brusque
and
curt
when
anne
thanked
her
and
again
the
latter
felt
thrown
back
upon
herself
leslie
gift
was
not
alone
in
the
little
house
miss
cornelia
had
for
the
time
being
given
up
sewing
for
unwanted
unwelcome
eighth
babies
and
fallen
to
sewing
for
a
very
much
wanted
first
one
whose
welcome
would
leave
nothing
to
be
desired
philippa
blake
and
diana
wright
each
sent
a
marvellous
garment
and
rachel
lynde
sent
several
in
which
good
material
and
honest
stitches
took
the
place
of
embroidery
and
frills
anne
herself
made
many
desecrated
by
no
touch
of
machinery
spending
over
them
the
happiest
hours
of
the
happy
winter
captain
jim
was
the
most
frequent
guest
of
the
little
house
and
none
was
more
welcome
every
day
anne
loved
the
old
sailor
more
and
more
he
was
as
refreshing
as
a
sea
breeze
as
interesting
as
some
ancient
chronicle
she
was
never
tired
of
listening
to
his
stories
and
his
quaint
remarks
and
comments
were
a
continual
delight
to
her
captain
jim
was
one
of
those
rare
and
interesting
people
who
never
speak
but
they
say
something
the
milk
of
human
kindness
and
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
were
mingled
in
his
composition
in
delightful
proportions
nothing
ever
seemed
to
put
captain
jim
out
or
depress
him
in
any
way
i
kind
of
contracted
a
habit
of
things
he
remarked
once
when
anne
had
commented
on
his
invariable
cheerfulness
it
got
so
chronic
that
i
believe
i
even
the
disagreeable
things
great
fun
thinking
they
ca
last
rheumatiz
says
i
when
it
grips
me
hard
got
to
stop
aching
sometime
the
worse
you
are
the
sooner
you
stop
mebbe
i
bound
to
get
the
better
of
you
in
the
long
run
whether
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
one
night
by
the
fireside
at
the
light
anne
saw
captain
he
needed
no
coaxing
to
show
it
and
proudly
gave
it
to
her
to
read
i
writ
it
to
leave
to
little
joe
he
said
i
do
like
the
idea
of
everything
i
done
and
seen
being
clean
forgot
after
i
shipped
for
my
last
joe
he
remember
it
and
tell
the
yarns
to
his
children
it
was
an
old
book
filled
with
the
record
of
his
voyages
and
adventures
anne
thought
what
a
treasure
trove
it
would
be
to
a
writer
every
sentence
was
a
nugget
in
itself
the
book
had
no
literary
merit
captain
jim
charm
of
storytelling
failed
him
when
he
came
to
pen
and
ink
he
could
only
jot
roughly
down
the
outline
of
his
famous
tales
and
both
spelling
and
grammar
were
sadly
askew
but
anne
felt
that
if
anyone
possessed
of
the
gift
could
take
that
simple
record
of
a
brave
adventurous
life
reading
between
the
bald
lines
the
tales
of
dangers
staunchly
faced
and
duty
manfully
done
a
wonderful
story
might
be
made
from
it
rich
comedy
and
thrilling
tragedy
were
both
lying
hidden
in
captain
jim
waiting
for
the
touch
of
the
master
hand
to
waken
the
laughter
and
grief
and
horror
of
thousands
anne
said
something
of
this
to
gilbert
as
they
walked
home
why
do
you
try
your
hand
at
it
yourself
anne
anne
shook
her
head
no
i
only
wish
i
could
but
it
not
in
the
power
of
my
gift
you
know
what
my
forte
is
gilbert
the
fanciful
the
fairylike
the
pretty
to
write
captain
jim
as
it
should
be
written
one
should
be
a
master
of
vigorous
yet
subtle
style
a
keen
psychologist
a
born
humorist
and
a
born
tragedian
a
rare
combination
of
gifts
is
needed
paul
might
do
it
if
he
were
older
anyhow
i
going
to
ask
him
to
come
down
next
summer
and
meet
captain
jim
come
to
this
shore
wrote
anne
to
paul
i
am
afraid
you
can
not
find
here
nora
or
the
golden
lady
or
the
twin
sailors
but
you
will
find
one
old
sailor
who
can
tell
you
wonderful
stories
paul
however
wrote
back
saying
regretfully
that
he
could
not
come
that
year
he
was
going
abroad
for
two
year
study
when
i
return
i
come
to
four
winds
dear
teacher
he
wrote
but
meanwhile
captain
jim
is
growing
old
said
anne
sorrowfully
and
there
is
nobody
to
write
his
chapter
spring
days
the
ice
in
the
harbor
grew
black
and
rotten
in
the
march
suns
in
april
there
were
blue
waters
and
a
windy
gulf
again
and
again
the
four
winds
light
begemmed
the
twilights
i
so
glad
to
see
it
once
more
said
anne
on
the
first
evening
of
its
reappearance
i
missed
it
so
all
winter
the
northwestern
sky
has
seemed
blank
and
lonely
without
it
the
land
was
tender
with
baby
leaves
there
was
an
emerald
mist
on
the
woods
beyond
the
glen
the
seaward
valleys
were
full
of
fairy
mists
at
dawn
vibrant
winds
came
and
went
with
salt
foam
in
their
breath
the
sea
laughed
and
flashed
and
preened
and
allured
like
a
beautiful
coquettish
woman
the
herring
schooled
and
the
fishing
village
woke
to
life
the
harbor
was
alive
with
white
sails
making
for
the
channel
the
ships
began
to
sail
outward
and
inward
again
on
a
spring
day
like
this
said
anne
i
know
exactly
what
my
soul
will
feel
like
on
the
resurrection
morning
there
are
times
in
spring
when
i
sorter
feel
that
i
might
have
been
a
poet
if
i
been
caught
young
remarked
captain
jim
i
catch
myself
conning
over
old
lines
and
verses
i
heard
the
schoolmaster
reciting
sixty
years
ago
they
do
trouble
me
at
other
times
now
i
feel
as
if
i
had
to
get
out
on
the
rocks
or
the
fields
or
the
water
and
spout
them
captain
jim
had
come
up
that
afternoon
to
bring
anne
a
load
of
shells
for
her
garden
and
a
little
bunch
of
which
he
had
found
in
a
ramble
over
the
sand
dunes
it
getting
real
scarce
along
this
shore
now
he
said
when
i
was
a
boy
there
was
of
it
but
now
it
only
once
in
a
while
you
find
a
plot
and
never
when
you
looking
for
it
you
jest
have
to
stumble
on
it
you
walking
along
on
the
sand
hills
never
thinking
of
and
all
at
once
the
air
is
full
of
sweetness
and
there
the
grass
under
your
feet
i
favor
the
smell
of
it
always
makes
me
think
of
my
mother
she
was
fond
of
it
asked
anne
not
that
i
knows
on
dunno
she
ever
saw
any
no
because
it
has
a
kind
of
motherly
perfume
not
too
young
you
understand
something
kind
of
seasoned
and
wholesome
and
dependable
jest
like
a
mother
the
schoolmaster
bride
always
kept
it
among
her
handkerchiefs
you
might
put
that
little
bunch
among
yours
mistress
blythe
i
do
like
these
boughten
scents
but
a
whiff
of
belongs
anywhere
a
lady
does
anne
had
not
been
especially
enthusiastic
over
the
idea
of
surrounding
her
flower
beds
with
quahog
shells
as
a
decoration
they
did
not
appeal
to
her
on
first
thought
but
she
would
not
have
hurt
captain
feelings
for
anything
so
she
assumed
a
virtue
she
did
not
at
first
feel
and
thanked
him
heartily
and
when
captain
jim
had
proudly
encircled
every
bed
with
a
rim
of
the
big
shells
anne
found
to
her
surprise
that
she
liked
the
effect
on
a
town
lawn
or
even
up
at
the
glen
they
would
not
have
been
in
keeping
but
here
in
the
garden
of
the
little
house
of
dreams
they
belonged
they
do
look
nice
she
said
sincerely
the
schoolmaster
bride
always
had
cowhawks
round
her
beds
said
captain
jim
she
was
a
master
hand
with
flowers
she
looked
at
and
touched
so
and
they
grew
like
mad
some
folks
have
that
knack
i
reckon
you
have
it
too
mistress
blythe
oh
i
do
know
but
i
love
my
garden
and
i
love
working
in
it
to
potter
with
green
growing
things
watching
each
day
to
see
the
dear
new
sprouts
come
up
is
like
taking
a
hand
in
creation
i
think
just
now
my
garden
is
like
faith
the
substance
of
things
hoped
for
but
bide
a
wee
it
always
amazes
me
to
look
at
the
little
wrinkled
brown
seeds
and
think
of
the
rainbows
in
said
captain
jim
when
i
ponder
on
them
seeds
i
do
find
it
nowise
hard
to
believe
that
we
got
souls
that
live
in
other
worlds
you
could
hardly
believe
there
was
life
in
them
tiny
things
some
no
bigger
than
grains
of
dust
let
alone
color
and
scent
if
you
had
seen
the
miracle
could
you
anne
who
was
counting
her
days
like
silver
beads
on
a
rosary
could
not
now
take
the
long
walk
to
the
lighthouse
or
up
the
glen
road
but
miss
cornelia
and
captain
jim
came
very
often
to
the
little
house
miss
cornelia
was
the
joy
of
anne
and
gilbert
existence
they
laughed
over
her
speeches
after
every
visit
when
captain
jim
and
she
happened
to
visit
the
little
house
at
the
same
time
there
was
much
sport
for
the
listening
they
waged
wordy
warfare
she
attacking
he
defending
anne
once
reproached
the
captain
for
his
baiting
of
miss
cornelia
oh
i
do
love
to
set
her
going
mistress
blythe
chuckled
the
unrepentant
sinner
it
the
greatest
amusement
i
have
in
life
that
tongue
of
hers
would
blister
a
stone
and
you
and
that
young
dog
of
a
doctor
listening
to
her
as
much
as
i
do
captain
jim
came
along
another
evening
to
bring
anne
some
mayflowers
the
garden
was
full
of
the
moist
scented
air
of
a
maritime
spring
evening
there
was
a
mist
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
with
a
young
moon
kissing
it
and
a
silver
gladness
of
stars
over
the
glen
the
bell
of
the
church
across
the
harbor
was
ringing
dreamily
sweet
the
mellow
chime
drifted
through
the
dusk
to
mingle
with
the
soft
of
the
sea
captain
jim
mayflowers
added
the
last
completing
touch
to
the
charm
of
the
night
i
have
seen
any
this
spring
and
i
missed
them
said
anne
burying
her
face
in
them
they
ai
to
be
found
around
four
winds
only
in
the
barrens
away
behind
the
glen
up
yander
i
took
a
little
trip
today
to
the
and
hunted
these
up
for
you
i
reckon
the
last
you
see
this
spring
for
they
nearly
done
how
kind
and
thoughtful
you
are
captain
jim
nobody
else
not
even
gilbert
with
a
shake
of
her
head
at
him
remembered
that
i
always
long
for
mayflowers
in
spring
well
i
had
another
errand
too
i
wanted
to
take
howard
back
yander
a
mess
of
trout
he
likes
one
occasional
and
it
all
i
can
do
for
a
kindness
he
did
me
once
i
stayed
all
the
afternoon
and
talked
to
him
he
likes
to
talk
to
me
though
he
a
highly
eddicated
man
and
i
only
an
ignorant
old
sailor
because
he
one
of
the
folks
got
to
talk
or
they
miserable
and
he
finds
listeners
scarce
around
here
the
glen
folks
fight
shy
of
him
because
they
think
he
an
infidel
he
ai
that
far
gone
exactly
few
men
is
i
reckon
but
he
what
you
might
call
a
heretic
heretics
are
wicked
but
mighty
it
jest
that
they
got
sorter
lost
looking
for
god
being
under
the
impression
that
he
hard
to
find
which
he
never
most
of
blunder
to
him
after
awhile
i
guess
i
think
listening
to
howard
arguments
is
likely
to
do
me
much
harm
mind
you
i
believe
what
i
was
brought
up
to
believe
it
saves
a
vast
of
bother
and
back
of
it
all
god
is
good
the
trouble
with
howard
is
that
he
a
leetle
too
clever
he
thinks
that
he
bound
to
live
up
to
his
cleverness
and
that
it
smarter
to
thrash
out
some
new
way
of
getting
to
heaven
than
to
go
by
the
old
track
the
common
ignorant
folks
is
travelling
but
he
get
there
sometime
all
right
and
then
he
laugh
at
himself
howard
was
a
methodist
to
begin
with
said
miss
cornelia
as
if
she
thought
he
had
not
far
to
go
from
that
to
heresy
do
you
know
cornelia
said
captain
jim
gravely
i
often
thought
that
if
i
was
a
presbyterian
i
be
a
methodist
oh
well
conceded
miss
cornelia
if
you
were
a
presbyterian
it
would
matter
much
what
you
were
speaking
of
heresy
reminds
me
doctor
i
brought
back
that
book
you
lent
me
that
natural
law
in
the
spiritual
world
i
did
read
a
third
of
it
i
can
read
sense
and
i
can
read
nonsense
but
that
book
is
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
it
is
considered
rather
heretical
in
some
quarters
admitted
gilbert
but
i
told
you
that
before
you
took
it
miss
cornelia
oh
i
would
have
minded
its
being
heretical
i
can
stand
wickedness
but
i
ca
stand
foolishness
said
miss
cornelia
calmly
and
with
the
air
of
having
said
the
last
thing
there
was
to
say
about
natural
law
speaking
of
books
a
mad
love
come
to
an
end
at
last
two
weeks
ago
remarked
captain
jim
musingly
it
run
to
one
hundred
and
three
chapters
when
they
got
married
the
book
stopped
right
off
so
i
reckon
their
troubles
were
all
over
it
real
nice
that
that
the
way
in
books
anyhow
is
it
even
if
so
anywhere
else
i
never
read
novels
said
miss
cornelia
did
you
hear
how
geordie
russell
was
today
captain
jim
yes
i
called
in
on
my
way
home
to
see
him
he
getting
round
all
right
but
stewing
in
a
broth
of
trouble
as
usual
poor
man
he
brews
up
most
of
it
for
himself
but
i
reckon
that
make
it
any
easier
to
bear
he
an
awful
pessimist
said
miss
cornelia
well
no
he
ai
a
pessimist
exactly
cornelia
he
only
jest
never
finds
anything
that
suits
him
and
is
that
a
pessimist
no
no
a
pessimist
is
one
who
never
expects
to
find
anything
to
suit
him
geordie
hai
got
that
far
yet
you
find
something
good
to
say
of
the
devil
himself
jim
boyd
well
you
heard
the
story
of
the
old
lady
who
said
he
was
persevering
but
no
cornelia
i
nothing
good
to
say
of
the
devil
do
you
believe
in
him
at
all
asked
miss
cornelia
seriously
how
can
you
ask
that
when
you
know
what
a
good
presbyterian
i
am
cornelia
how
could
a
presbyterian
get
along
without
a
devil
do
you
persisted
miss
cornelia
captain
jim
suddenly
became
grave
i
believe
in
what
i
heard
a
minister
once
call
mighty
and
malignant
and
intelligent
power
of
evil
working
in
the
universe
he
said
solemnly
i
do
that
cornelia
you
can
call
it
the
devil
or
the
of
evil
or
the
old
scratch
or
any
name
you
like
there
and
all
the
infidels
and
heretics
in
the
world
ca
argue
it
away
any
they
can
argue
god
away
it
there
and
working
but
mind
you
cornelia
i
believe
it
going
to
get
the
worst
of
it
in
the
long
run
i
am
sure
i
hope
so
said
miss
cornelia
none
too
hopefully
but
speaking
of
the
devil
i
am
positive
that
billy
booth
is
possessed
by
him
now
have
you
heard
of
billy
latest
performance
no
what
was
that
he
gone
and
burned
up
his
wife
new
brown
broadcloth
suit
that
she
paid
dollars
for
in
charlottetown
because
he
declares
the
men
looked
too
admiring
at
her
when
she
wore
it
to
church
the
first
time
was
that
like
a
man
mistress
booth
is
mighty
pretty
and
brown
her
color
said
captain
jim
reflectively
is
that
any
good
reason
why
he
should
poke
her
new
suit
into
the
kitchen
stove
billy
booth
is
a
jealous
fool
and
he
makes
his
life
miserable
she
cried
all
the
week
about
her
suit
oh
anne
i
wish
i
could
write
like
you
believe
me
would
i
score
some
of
the
men
round
here
those
booths
are
all
a
mite
queer
said
captain
jim
billy
seemed
the
sanest
of
the
lot
till
he
got
married
and
then
this
queer
jealous
streak
cropped
out
in
him
his
brother
daniel
now
was
always
odd
took
tantrums
every
few
days
or
so
and
would
get
out
of
bed
said
miss
cornelia
with
a
relish
his
wife
would
have
to
do
all
the
barn
work
till
he
got
over
his
spell
when
he
died
people
wrote
her
letters
of
condolence
if
i
written
anything
it
would
have
been
one
of
congratulation
their
father
old
abram
booth
was
a
disgusting
old
sot
he
was
drunk
at
his
wife
funeral
and
kept
reeling
round
and
hiccuping
did
dri
i
i
nk
much
but
i
feel
a
a
awfully
que
e
e
i
gave
him
a
good
jab
in
the
back
with
my
umbrella
when
he
came
near
me
and
it
sobered
him
up
until
they
got
the
casket
out
of
the
house
young
johnny
booth
was
to
have
been
married
yesterday
but
he
could
be
because
he
gone
and
got
the
mumps
was
that
like
a
man
how
could
he
help
getting
the
mumps
poor
fellow
i
poor
fellow
him
believe
me
if
i
was
kate
sterns
i
do
know
how
he
could
help
getting
the
mumps
but
i
do
know
the
wedding
supper
was
all
prepared
and
everything
will
be
spoiled
before
he
well
again
such
a
waste
he
should
have
had
the
mumps
when
he
was
a
boy
come
come
cornelia
do
you
think
you
a
mite
unreasonable
miss
cornelia
disdained
to
reply
and
turned
instead
to
susan
baker
a
elderly
spinster
of
the
glen
who
had
been
installed
as
at
the
little
house
for
some
weeks
susan
had
been
up
to
the
glen
to
make
a
sick
call
and
had
just
returned
how
is
poor
old
aunt
mandy
tonight
asked
miss
cornelia
susan
sighed
very
poorly
very
poorly
cornelia
i
am
afraid
she
will
soon
be
in
heaven
poor
thing
oh
surely
it
not
so
bad
as
that
exclaimed
miss
cornelia
sympathetically
captain
jim
and
gilbert
looked
at
each
other
then
they
suddenly
rose
and
went
out
there
are
times
said
captain
jim
between
spasms
when
it
would
be
a
sin
not
to
laugh
them
two
excellent
women
chapter
dawn
and
dusk
in
early
june
when
the
sand
hills
were
a
great
glory
of
pink
wild
roses
and
the
glen
was
smothered
in
apple
blossoms
marilla
arrived
at
the
little
house
accompanied
by
a
black
horsehair
trunk
patterned
with
brass
nails
which
had
reposed
undisturbed
in
the
green
gables
garret
for
half
a
century
susan
baker
who
during
her
few
sojourn
in
the
little
house
had
come
to
worship
young
mrs
doctor
as
she
called
anne
with
blind
fervor
looked
rather
jealously
askance
at
marilla
at
first
but
as
marilla
did
not
try
to
interfere
in
kitchen
matters
and
showed
no
desire
to
interrupt
ministrations
to
young
mrs
doctor
the
good
handmaiden
became
reconciled
to
her
presence
and
told
her
cronies
at
the
glen
that
miss
cuthbert
was
a
fine
old
lady
and
knew
her
place
one
evening
when
the
sky
limpid
bowl
was
filled
with
a
red
glory
and
the
robins
were
thrilling
the
golden
twilight
with
jubilant
hymns
to
the
stars
of
evening
there
was
a
sudden
commotion
in
the
little
house
of
dreams
telephone
messages
were
sent
up
to
the
glen
doctor
dave
and
a
nurse
came
hastily
down
marilla
paced
the
garden
walks
between
the
quahog
shells
murmuring
prayers
between
her
set
lips
and
susan
sat
in
the
kitchen
with
cotton
wool
in
her
ears
and
her
apron
over
her
head
leslie
looking
out
from
the
house
up
the
brook
saw
that
every
window
of
the
little
house
was
alight
and
did
not
sleep
that
night
the
june
night
was
short
but
it
seemed
an
eternity
to
those
who
waited
and
watched
oh
will
it
never
end
said
marilla
then
she
saw
how
grave
the
nurse
and
doctor
dave
looked
and
she
dared
ask
no
more
questions
suppose
anne
but
marilla
could
not
suppose
it
do
not
tell
me
said
susan
fiercely
answering
the
anguish
in
marilla
eyes
that
god
could
be
so
cruel
as
to
take
that
darling
lamb
from
us
when
we
all
love
her
so
much
he
has
taken
others
as
well
beloved
said
marilla
hoarsely
but
at
dawn
when
the
rising
sun
rent
apart
the
mists
hanging
over
the
sandbar
and
made
rainbows
of
them
joy
came
to
the
little
house
anne
was
safe
and
a
wee
white
lady
with
her
mother
big
eyes
was
lying
beside
her
gilbert
his
face
gray
and
haggard
from
his
night
agony
came
down
to
tell
marilla
and
susan
thank
god
shuddered
marilla
susan
got
up
and
took
the
cotton
wool
out
of
her
ears
now
for
breakfast
she
said
briskly
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
we
will
all
be
glad
of
a
bite
and
sup
you
tell
young
mrs
doctor
not
to
worry
about
a
single
thing
susan
is
at
the
helm
you
tell
her
just
to
think
of
her
baby
gilbert
smiled
rather
sadly
as
he
went
away
anne
her
pale
face
blanched
with
its
baptism
of
pain
her
eyes
aglow
with
the
holy
passion
of
motherhood
did
not
need
to
be
told
to
think
of
her
baby
she
thought
of
nothing
else
for
a
few
hours
she
tasted
of
happiness
so
rare
and
exquisite
that
she
wondered
if
the
angels
in
heaven
did
not
envy
her
little
joyce
she
murmured
when
marilla
came
in
to
see
the
baby
we
planned
to
call
her
that
if
she
were
a
girlie
there
were
so
many
we
would
have
liked
to
name
her
for
we
could
choose
between
them
so
we
decided
on
joyce
we
can
call
her
joy
for
short
joy
it
suits
so
well
oh
marilla
i
thought
i
was
happy
before
now
i
know
that
i
just
dreamed
a
pleasant
dream
of
happiness
this
is
the
reality
you
must
talk
anne
wait
till
you
stronger
said
marilla
warningly
you
know
how
hard
it
is
for
me
not
to
talk
smiled
anne
at
first
she
was
too
weak
and
too
happy
to
notice
that
gilbert
and
the
nurse
looked
grave
and
marilla
sorrowful
then
as
subtly
and
coldly
and
remorselessly
as
a
stealing
landward
fear
crept
into
her
heart
why
was
not
gilbert
gladder
why
would
he
not
talk
about
the
baby
why
would
they
not
let
her
have
it
with
her
after
that
first
heavenly
happy
hour
was
was
there
anything
wrong
gilbert
whispered
anne
imploringly
the
baby
is
all
right
she
tell
me
tell
me
gilbert
was
a
long
while
in
turning
round
then
he
bent
over
anne
and
looked
in
her
eyes
marilla
listening
fearfully
outside
the
door
heard
a
pitiful
heartbroken
moan
and
fled
to
the
kitchen
where
susan
was
weeping
oh
the
poor
lamb
the
poor
lamb
how
can
she
bear
it
miss
cuthbert
i
am
afraid
it
will
kill
her
she
has
been
that
built
up
and
happy
longing
for
that
baby
and
planning
for
it
can
not
anything
be
done
nohow
miss
cuthbert
i
afraid
not
susan
gilbert
says
there
is
no
hope
he
knew
from
the
first
the
little
thing
could
live
and
it
is
such
a
sweet
baby
sobbed
susan
i
never
saw
one
so
white
they
are
mostly
red
or
yallow
and
it
opened
its
big
eyes
as
if
it
was
months
old
the
little
little
thing
oh
the
poor
young
mrs
doctor
at
sunset
the
little
soul
that
had
come
with
the
dawning
went
away
leaving
heartbreak
behind
it
miss
cornelia
took
the
wee
white
lady
from
the
kindly
but
stranger
hands
of
the
nurse
and
dressed
the
tiny
waxen
form
in
the
beautiful
dress
leslie
had
made
for
it
leslie
had
asked
her
to
do
that
then
she
took
it
back
and
laid
it
beside
the
poor
broken
little
mother
the
lord
has
given
and
the
lord
has
taken
away
dearie
she
said
through
her
own
tears
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
then
she
went
away
leaving
anne
and
gilbert
alone
together
with
their
dead
the
next
day
the
small
white
joy
was
laid
in
a
velvet
casket
which
leslie
had
lined
with
and
taken
to
the
graveyard
of
the
church
across
the
harbor
miss
cornelia
and
marilla
put
all
the
little
garments
away
together
with
the
ruffled
basket
which
had
been
befrilled
and
belaced
for
dimpled
limbs
and
downy
head
little
joy
was
never
to
sleep
there
she
had
found
a
colder
narrower
bed
this
has
been
an
awful
disappointment
to
me
sighed
miss
cornelia
i
looked
forward
to
this
baby
and
i
did
want
it
to
be
a
girl
too
i
can
only
be
thankful
that
anne
life
was
spared
said
marilla
with
a
shiver
recalling
those
hours
of
darkness
when
the
girl
she
loved
was
passing
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
poor
poor
lamb
her
heart
is
broken
said
susan
i
envy
anne
said
leslie
suddenly
and
fiercely
and
i
envy
her
even
if
she
had
died
she
was
a
mother
for
one
beautiful
day
gladly
give
my
life
for
that
i
would
talk
like
that
leslie
dearie
said
miss
cornelia
deprecatingly
she
was
afraid
that
the
dignified
miss
cuthbert
would
think
leslie
quite
terrible
anne
convalescence
was
long
and
made
bitter
for
her
by
many
things
the
bloom
and
sunshine
of
the
four
winds
world
grated
harshly
on
her
and
yet
when
the
rain
fell
heavily
she
pictured
it
beating
so
mercilessly
down
on
that
little
grave
across
the
harbor
and
when
the
wind
blew
around
the
eaves
she
heard
sad
voices
in
it
she
had
never
heard
before
kindly
callers
hurt
her
too
with
the
platitudes
with
which
they
strove
to
cover
the
nakedness
of
bereavement
a
letter
from
phil
blake
was
an
added
sting
phil
had
heard
of
the
baby
birth
but
not
of
its
death
and
she
wrote
anne
a
congratulatory
letter
of
sweet
mirth
which
hurt
her
horribly
i
would
have
laughed
over
it
so
happily
if
i
had
my
baby
she
sobbed
to
marilla
but
when
i
have
it
just
seems
like
wanton
cruelty
though
i
know
phil
would
hurt
me
for
the
world
oh
marilla
i
do
see
how
i
can
ever
be
happy
again
everything
will
hurt
me
all
the
rest
of
my
life
time
will
help
you
said
marilla
who
was
racked
with
sympathy
but
could
never
learn
to
express
it
in
other
than
formulas
it
does
seem
fair
said
anne
rebelliously
babies
are
born
and
live
where
they
are
not
wanted
where
they
will
be
neglected
where
they
will
have
no
chance
i
would
have
loved
my
baby
so
and
cared
for
it
so
tenderly
and
tried
to
give
her
every
chance
for
good
and
yet
i
was
allowed
to
keep
her
it
was
god
will
anne
said
marilla
helpless
before
the
riddle
of
the
universe
the
why
of
undeserved
pain
and
little
joy
is
better
off
i
ca
believe
that
cried
anne
bitterly
then
seeing
that
marilla
looked
shocked
she
added
passionately
why
should
she
be
born
at
all
why
should
any
one
be
born
at
all
if
she
better
off
dead
i
do
believe
it
is
better
for
a
child
to
die
at
birth
than
to
live
its
life
out
and
love
and
be
loved
and
enjoy
and
suffer
and
do
its
work
and
develop
a
character
that
would
give
it
a
personality
in
eternity
and
how
do
you
know
it
was
god
will
perhaps
it
was
just
a
thwarting
of
his
purpose
by
the
power
of
evil
we
ca
be
expected
to
be
resigned
to
that
oh
anne
do
talk
so
said
marilla
genuinely
alarmed
lest
anne
were
drifting
into
deep
and
dangerous
waters
we
understand
but
we
must
have
faith
we
must
believe
that
all
is
for
the
best
i
know
you
find
it
hard
to
think
so
just
now
but
try
to
be
brave
for
gilbert
sake
he
so
worried
about
you
you
getting
strong
as
fast
as
you
should
oh
i
know
i
been
very
selfish
sighed
anne
i
love
gilbert
more
than
ever
and
i
want
to
live
for
his
sake
but
it
seems
as
if
part
of
me
was
buried
over
there
in
that
little
harbor
graveyard
and
it
hurts
so
much
that
i
afraid
of
life
it
wo
hurt
so
much
always
anne
the
thought
that
it
may
stop
hurting
sometimes
hurts
me
worse
than
all
else
marilla
yes
i
know
i
felt
that
too
about
other
things
but
we
all
love
you
anne
captain
jim
has
been
up
every
day
to
ask
for
you
and
moore
haunts
the
place
and
miss
bryant
spends
most
of
her
time
i
think
cooking
up
nice
things
for
you
susan
does
like
it
very
well
she
thinks
she
can
cook
as
well
as
miss
bryant
dear
susan
oh
everybody
has
been
so
dear
and
good
and
lovely
to
me
marilla
i
not
ungrateful
and
perhaps
when
this
horrible
ache
grows
a
little
less
i
find
that
i
can
go
on
living
chapter
lost
margaret
anne
found
that
she
could
go
on
living
the
day
came
when
she
even
smiled
again
over
one
of
miss
cornelia
speeches
but
there
was
something
in
the
smile
that
had
never
been
in
anne
smile
before
and
would
never
be
absent
from
it
again
on
the
first
day
she
was
able
to
go
for
a
drive
gilbert
took
her
down
to
four
winds
point
and
left
her
there
while
he
rowed
over
the
channel
to
see
a
patient
at
the
fishing
village
a
rollicking
wind
was
scudding
across
the
harbor
and
the
dunes
whipping
the
water
into
and
washing
the
sandshore
with
long
lines
of
silvery
breakers
i
real
proud
to
see
you
here
again
mistress
blythe
said
captain
jim
sit
down
sit
down
i
afeared
it
mighty
dusty
here
today
but
there
no
need
of
looking
at
dust
when
you
can
look
at
such
scenery
is
there
i
do
mind
the
dust
said
anne
but
gilbert
says
i
must
keep
in
the
open
air
i
think
i
go
and
sit
on
the
rocks
down
there
would
you
like
company
or
would
you
rather
be
alone
if
by
company
you
mean
yours
i
much
rather
have
it
than
be
alone
said
anne
smiling
then
she
sighed
she
had
never
before
minded
being
alone
now
she
dreaded
it
when
she
was
alone
now
she
felt
so
dreadfully
alone
here
a
nice
little
spot
where
the
wind
ca
get
at
you
said
captain
jim
when
they
reached
the
rocks
i
often
sit
here
it
a
great
place
jest
to
sit
and
dream
oh
dreams
sighed
anne
i
ca
dream
now
captain
jim
i
done
with
dreams
oh
no
you
not
mistress
blythe
oh

captain
jim
meditatively
i

how
you

now
but
if
you
keep
on
living
you
get
glad
again
and
the
first
thing

dreaming

thank
the
good
lord
for
it
if
it
was
for
our
dreams
they
might
as
well
bury
us
how
we
stand
living
if
it
for
our
dream
of
immortality
and
that
a
dream
that
bound
to
come
true
mistress
blythe
you
see
your
little
joyce
again
some
day
but
she
wo
be
my
baby
said
anne
with
trembling
lips
oh

may
be
as
longfellow
says
fair
maiden
clothed
with
celestial
grace
but
she
be
a
stranger
to
me
god
will
manage
that
i
believe
said
captain
jim
they
were
both
silent
for
a
little
time
then
captain
jim
said
very
softly
mistress
blythe
may
i
tell
you
about
lost
margaret
of
course
said
anne
gently
she
did
not
know
who
lost
margaret
was
but
she
felt
that
she
was
going
to
hear
the
romance
of
captain
jim
life
i
often
wanted
to
tell
you
about
her
captain
jim
went
on
do
you
know
why
mistress
blythe
it
because
i
want
somebody
to
remember
and
think
of
her
sometime
after
i
gone
i
ca
bear
that
her
name
should
be
forgotten
by
all
living
souls
and
now
nobody
remembers
lost
margaret
but
me
then
captain
jim
told
the
story
an
old
old
forgotten
story
for
it
was
over
fifty
years
since
margaret
had
fallen
asleep
one
day
in
her
father
dory
and
drifted
or
so
it
was
supposed
for
nothing
was
ever
certainly
known
as
to
her
fate
out
of
the
channel
beyond
the
bar
to
perish
in
the
black
thundersquall
which
had
come
up
so
suddenly
that
summer
afternoon
but
to
captain
jim
those
fifty
years
were
but
as
yesterday
when
it
is
past
i
walked
the
shore
for
months
after
that
he
said
sadly
looking
to
find
her
dear
sweet
little
body
but
the
sea
never
give
her
back
to
me
but
i
find
her
sometime
mistress
blythe
i
find
her
sometime
she
waiting
for
me
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
jest
how
she
looked
but
i
ca
i
seen
a
fine
silvery
mist
hanging
over
the
bar
at
sunrise
that
seemed
like
her
and
then
again
i
seen
a
white
birch
in
the
woods
back
yander
that
made
me
think
of
her
she
had
pale
brown
hair
and
a
little
white
sweet
face
and
long
slender
fingers
like
yours
mistress
blythe
only
browner
for
she
was
a
shore
girl
sometimes
i
wake
up
in
the
night
and
hear
the
sea
calling
to
me
in
the
old
way
and
it
seems
as
if
lost
margaret
called
in
it
and
when
there
a
storm
and
the
waves
are
sobbing
and
moaning
i
hear
her
lamenting
among
them
and
when
they
laugh
on
a
gay
day
it
her
laugh
lost
margaret
sweet
roguish
little
laugh
the
sea
took
her
from
me
but
some
day
i
find
her
mistress
blythe
it
ca
keep
us
apart
forever
i
am
glad
you
have
told
me
about
her
said
anne
i
have
often
wondered
why
you
had
lived
all
your
life
alone
i
could
ever
care
for
anyone
else
lost
margaret
took
my
heart
with
her
out
there
said
the
old
lover
who
had
been
faithful
for
fifty
years
to
his
drowned
sweetheart
you
wo
mind
if
i
talk
a
good
deal
about
her
will
you
mistress
blythe
it
a
pleasure
to
me
for
all
the
pain
went
out
of
her
memory
years
ago
and
jest
left
its
blessing
i
know
you
never
forget
her
mistress
blythe
and
if
the
years
as
i
hope
bring
other
little
folks
to
your
home
i
want
you
to
promise
me
that
you
tell
them
the
story
of
lost
margaret
so
that
her
name
wo
be
forgotten
among
humankind
chapter
barriers
swept
away
anne
said
leslie
breaking
abruptly
a
short
silence
you
do
know
how
good
it
is
to
be
sitting
here
with
you
again
working
and
talking
and
being
silent
together
they
were
sitting
among
the
grasses
on
the
bank
of
the
brook
in
anne
garden
the
water
sparkled
and
crooned
past
them
the
birches
threw
dappled
shadows
over
them
roses
bloomed
along
the
walks
the
sun
was
beginning
to
be
low
and
the
air
was
full
of
woven
music
there
was
one
music
of
the
wind
in
the
firs
behind
the
house
and
another
of
the
waves
on
the
bar
and
still
another
from
the
distant
bell
of
the
church
near
which
the
wee
white
lady
slept
anne
loved
that
bell
though
it
brought
sorrowful
thoughts
now
she
looked
curiously
at
leslie
who
had
thrown
down
her
sewing
and
spoken
with
a
lack
of
restraint
that
was
very
unusual
with
her
on
that
horrible
night
when
you
were
so
ill
leslie
went
on
i
kept
thinking
that
perhaps
we
have
no
more
talks
and
walks
and
works
together
and
i
realised
just
what
your
friendship
had
come
to
mean
to
me
just
what
you
meant
and
just
what
a
hateful
little
beast
i
had
been
leslie
leslie
i
never
allow
anyone
to
call
my
friends
names
it
true
that
exactly
what
i
am
a
hateful
little
beast
something
i
got
to
tell
you
anne
i
suppose
it
will
make
you
despise
me
but
i
must
confess
it
anne
there
have
been
times
this
past
winter
and
spring
when
i
have
hated
you
i
knew
it
said
anne
calmly
you
knew
it
yes
i
saw
it
in
your
eyes
and
yet
you
went
on
liking
me
and
being
my
friend
well
it
was
only
now
and
then
you
hated
me
leslie
between
times
you
loved
me
i
think
i
certainly
did
but
that
other
horrid
feeling
was
always
there
spoiling
it
back
in
my
heart
i
kept
it
down
sometimes
i
forgot
it
but
sometimes
it
would
surge
up
and
take
possession
of
me
i
hated
you
because
i
envied
you
oh
i
was
sick
with
envy
of
you
at
times
you
had
a
dear
little
home
and
love
and
happiness
and
glad
dreams
everything
i
wanted
and
never
had
and
never
could
have
oh
never
could
have
that
was
what
stung
i
would
have
envied
you
if
i
had
had
any
hope
that
life
would
ever
be
different
for
me
but
i
had
i
had
and
it
did
seem
fair
it
made
me
rebellious
and
it
hurt
me
and
so
i
hated
you
at
times
oh
i
was
so
ashamed
of
it
i
dying
of
shame
now
but
i
could
conquer
it
that
night
when
i
was
afraid
you
might
live
i
thought
i
was
going
to
be
punished
for
my
wickedness
and
i
loved
you
so
then
anne
anne
i
never
had
anything
to
love
since
my
mother
died
except
dick
old
dog
and
it
so
dreadful
to
have
nothing
to
love
life
is
so
empty
and
there
nothing
worse
than
emptiness
and
i
might
have
loved
you
so
much
and
that
horrible
thing
had
spoiled
it
leslie
was
trembling
and
growing
almost
incoherent
with
the
violence
of
her
emotion
do
leslie
implored
anne
oh
do
i
understand
do
talk
of
it
any
more
i
must
i
must
when
i
knew
you
were
going
to
live
i
vowed
that
i
would
tell
you
as
soon
as
you
were
well
that
i
would
go
on
accepting
your
friendship
and
companionship
without
telling
you
how
unworthy
i
was
of
it
and
i
been
so
afraid
it
would
turn
you
against
me
you
need
fear
that
leslie
oh
i
so
glad
so
glad
anne
leslie
clasped
her
brown
hands
tightly
together
to
still
their
shaking
but
i
want
to
tell
you
everything
now
i
begun
you
do
remember
the
first
time
i
saw
you
i
suppose
it
was
that
night
on
the
shore
no
it
was
the
night
gilbert
and
i
came
home
you
were
driving
your
geese
down
the
hill
i
should
think
i
do
remember
it
i
thought
you
were
so
beautiful
i
longed
for
weeks
after
to
find
out
who
you
were
i
knew
who
you
were
although
i
had
never
seen
either
of
you
before
i
had
heard
of
the
new
doctor
and
his
bride
who
were
coming
to
live
in
miss
russell
little
house
i
i
hated
you
that
very
moment
anne
i
felt
the
resentment
in
your
eyes
then
i
doubted
i
thought
i
must
be
mistaken
because
why
should
it
be
it
was
because
you
looked
so
happy
oh
you
agree
with
me
now
that
i
am
a
hateful
beast
to
hate
another
woman
just
because
she
was
happy
and
when
her
happiness
did
take
anything
from
me
that
was
why
i
never
went
to
see
you
i
knew
quite
well
i
ought
to
go
even
our
simple
four
winds
customs
demanded
that
but
i
could
i
used
to
watch
you
from
my
window
i
could
see
you
and
your
husband
strolling
about
your
garden
in
the
evening
or
you
running
down
the
poplar
lane
to
meet
him
and
it
hurt
me
and
yet
in
another
way
i
wanted
to
go
over
i
felt
that
if
i
were
not
so
miserable
i
could
have
liked
you
and
found
in
you
what
i
never
had
in
my
life
an
intimate
real
friend
of
my
own
age
and
then
you
remember
that
night
at
the
shore
you
were
afraid
i
would
think
you
crazy
you
must
have
thought
was
no
but
i
could
understand
you
leslie
one
moment
you
drew
me
to
you
the
next
you
pushed
me
back
i
was
very
unhappy
that
evening
i
had
had
a
hard
day
dick
had
been
very
very
hard
to
manage
that
day
generally
he
is
quite
and
easily
controlled
you
know
anne
but
some
days
he
is
very
different
i
was
so
heartsick
i
ran
away
to
the
shore
as
soon
as
he
went
to
sleep
it
was
my
only
refuge
i
sat
there
thinking
of
how
my
poor
father
had
ended
his
life
and
wondering
if
i
would
be
driven
to
it
some
day
oh
my
heart
was
full
of
black
thoughts
and
then
you
came
dancing
along
the
cove
like
a
glad
child
i
i
hated
you
more
then
than
i
ever
done
since
and
yet
i
craved
your
friendship
the
one
feeling
swayed
me
one
moment
the
other
feeling
the
next
when
i
got
home
that
night
i
cried
for
shame
of
what
you
must
think
of
me
but
it
always
been
just
the
same
when
i
came
over
here
sometimes
i
be
happy
and
enjoy
my
visit
and
at
other
times
that
hideous
feeling
would
mar
it
all
there
were
times
when
everything
about
you
and
your
house
hurt
me
you
had
so
many
dear
little
things
i
could
have
do
you
know
it
ridiculous
but
i
had
an
especial
spite
at
those
china
dogs
of
yours
there
were
times
when
i
wanted
to
catch
up
gog
and
magog
and
bang
their
pert
black
noses
together
oh
you
smile
anne
but
it
was
never
funny
to
me
i
would
come
here
and
see
you
and
gilbert
with
your
books
and
your
flowers
and
your
household
gods
and
your
little
family
jokes
and
your
love
for
each
other
showing
in
every
look
and
word
even
when
you
did
know
it
and
i
would
go
home
to
you
know
what
i
went
home
to
oh
anne
i
do
believe
i
jealous
and
envious
by
nature
when
i
was
a
girl
i
lacked
many
things
my
schoolmates
had
but
i
never
cared
i
never
disliked
them
for
it
but
i
seem
to
have
grown
so
hateful
leslie
dearest
stop
blaming
yourself
you
are
not
hateful
or
jealous
or
envious
the
life
you
have
to
live
has
warped
you
a
little
it
would
have
ruined
a
nature
less
fine
and
noble
than
yours
i
letting
you
tell
me
all
this
because
i
believe
it
better
for
you
to
talk
it
out
and
rid
your
soul
of
it
but
do
blame
yourself
any
more
well
i
wo
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
me
as
i
am
that
time
you
told
me
of
your
darling
hope
for
the
spring
was
the
worst
of
all
anne
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
for
the
way
i
behaved
then
i
repented
it
with
tears
and
i
did
put
many
a
tender
and
loving
thought
of
you
into
the
little
dress
i
made
but
i
might
have
known
that
anything
i
made
could
only
be
a
shroud
in
the
end
now
leslie
that
is
bitter
and
morbid
put
such
thoughts
away
i
was
so
glad
when
you
brought
the
little
dress
and
since
i
had
to
lose
little
joyce
i
like
to
think
that
the
dress
she
wore
was
the
one
you
made
for
her
when
you
let
yourself
love
me
anne
do
you
know
i
believe
i
shall
always
love
you
after
this
i
do
think
i
ever
feel
that
dreadful
way
about
you
again
talking
it
all
out
seems
to
have
done
away
with
it
somehow
it
very
strange
and
i
thought
it
so
real
and
bitter
it
like
opening
the
door
of
a
dark
room
to
show
some
hideous
creature
you
believed
to
be
there
and
when
the
light
streams
in
your
monster
turns
out
to
have
been
just
a
shadow
vanishing
when
the
light
comes
it
will
never
come
between
us
again
no
we
are
real
friends
now
leslie
and
i
am
very
glad
i
hope
you
wo
misunderstand
me
if
i
say
something
else
anne
i
was
grieved
to
the
core
of
my
heart
when
you
lost
your
baby
and
if
i
could
have
saved
her
for
you
by
cutting
off
one
of
my
hands
i
would
have
done
it
but
your
sorrow
has
brought
us
closer
together
your
perfect
happiness
is
a
barrier
any
longer
oh
do
misunderstand
dearest
i
not
glad
that
your
happiness
is
perfect
any
longer
i
can
say
that
sincerely
but
since
it
is
there
is
such
a
gulf
between
us
i
do
understand
that
too
leslie
now
we
just
shut
up
the
past
and
forget
what
was
unpleasant
in
it
it
all
going
to
be
different
we
both
of
the
race
of
joseph
now
i
think
you
been
wonderful
wonderful
and
leslie
i
ca
help
believing
that
life
has
something
good
and
beautiful
for
you
yet
leslie
shook
her
head
no
she
said
dully
there
is
any
hope
dick
will
never
be
better
and
even
if
his
memory
were
to
come
back
oh
anne
it
would
be
worse
even
worse
than
it
is
now
this
is
something
you
understand
you
happy
bride
anne
did
miss
cornelia
ever
tell
you
how
i
came
to
marry
dick
yes
i
glad
i
wanted
you
to
know
but
i
could
bring
myself
to
talk
of
it
if
you
had
known
anne
it
seems
to
me
that
ever
since
i
was
twelve
years
old
life
has
been
bitter
before
that
i
had
a
happy
childhood
we
were
very
poor
but
we
did
mind
father
was
so
splendid
so
clever
and
loving
and
sympathetic
we
were
chums
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
and
mother
was
so
sweet
she
was
very
very
beautiful
i
look
like
her
but
i
am
not
so
beautiful
as
she
was
miss
cornelia
says
you
are
far
more
beautiful
she
is
mistaken
or
prejudiced
i
think
my
figure
is
better
mother
was
slight
and
bent
by
hard
work
but
she
had
the
face
of
an
angel
i
used
just
to
look
up
at
her
in
worship
we
all
worshipped
her
father
and
kenneth
and
i
anne
remembered
that
miss
cornelia
had
given
her
a
very
different
impression
of
leslie
mother
but
had
not
love
the
truer
vision
still
it
was
selfish
of
rose
west
to
make
her
daughter
marry
dick
moore
kenneth
was
my
brother
went
on
leslie
oh
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
loved
him
and
he
was
cruelly
killed
do
you
know
how
yes
anne
i
saw
his
little
face
as
the
wheel
went
over
him
he
fell
on
his
back
anne
anne
i
can
see
it
now
i
shall
always
see
it
anne
all
i
ask
of
heaven
is
that
that
recollection
shall
be
blotted
out
of
my
memory
o
my
god
leslie
do
speak
of
it
i
know
the
story
do
go
into
details
that
only
harrow
your
soul
up
unavailingly
it
will
be
blotted
out
after
a
moment
struggle
leslie
regained
a
measure
of
then
father
health
got
worse
and
he
grew
despondent
his
mind
became
unbalanced
you
heard
all
that
too
yes
after
that
i
had
just
mother
to
live
for
but
i
was
very
ambitious
i
meant
to
teach
and
earn
my
way
through
college
i
meant
to
climb
to
the
very
top
oh
i
wo
talk
of
that
either
it
no
use
you
know
what
happened
i
could
see
my
dear
little
mother
who
had
been
such
a
slave
all
her
life
turned
out
of
her
home
of
course
i
could
have
earned
enough
for
us
to
live
on
but
mother
leave
her
home
she
had
come
there
as
a
bride
and
she
had
loved
father
so
and
all
her
memories
were
there
even
yet
anne
when
i
think
that
i
made
her
last
year
happy
i
not
sorry
for
what
i
did
as
for
dick
i
did
hate
him
when
i
married
him
i
just
felt
for
him
the
indifferent
friendly
feeling
i
had
for
most
of
my
schoolmates
i
knew
he
drank
some
but
i
had
never
heard
the
story
of
the
girl
down
at
the
fishing
cove
if
i
had
i
could
have
married
him
even
for
sake
afterwards
i
did
hate
him
but
mother
never
knew
she
died
and
then
i
was
alone
i
was
only
seventeen
and
i
was
alone
dick
had
gone
off
in
the
four
sisters
i
hoped
he
would
be
home
very
much
more
the
sea
had
always
been
in
his
blood
i
had
no
other
hope
well
captain
jim
brought
him
home
as
you
know
and
that
all
there
is
to
say
you
know
me
now
anne
the
worst
of
me
the
barriers
are
all
down
and
you
still
want
to
be
my
friend
anne
looked
up
through
the
birches
at
the
white
of
a
half
moon
drifting
downwards
to
the
gulf
of
sunset
her
face
was
very
sweet
i
am
your
friend
and
you
are
mine
for
always
she
said
such
a
friend
as
i
never
had
before
i
have
had
many
dear
and
beloved
friends
but
there
is
a
something
in
you
leslie
that
i
never
found
in
anyone
else
you
have
more
to
offer
me
in
that
rich
nature
of
yours
and
i
have
more
to
give
you
than
i
had
in
my
careless
girlhood
we
are
both
women
and
friends
forever
they
clasped
hands
and
smiled
at
each
other
through
the
tears
that
filled
the
gray
eyes
and
the
blue
chapter
miss
cornelia
arranges
matters
gilbert
insisted
that
susan
should
be
kept
on
at
the
little
house
for
the
summer
anne
protested
at
first
life
here
with
just
the
two
of
us
is
so
sweet
gilbert
it
spoils
it
a
little
to
have
anyone
else
susan
is
a
dear
soul
but
she
is
an
outsider
it
wo
hurt
me
to
do
the
work
here
you
must
take
your
doctor
advice
said
gilbert
there
an
old
proverb
to
the
effect
that
shoemakers
wives
go
barefoot
and
wives
die
young
i
do
mean
that
it
shall
be
true
in
my
household
you
will
keep
susan
until
the
old
spring
comes
back
into
your
step
and
those
little
hollows
on
your
cheeks
fill
out
you
just
take
it
easy
mrs
doctor
dear
said
susan
coming
abruptly
in
have
a
good
time
and
do
not
worry
about
the
pantry
susan
is
at
the
helm
there
is
no
use
in
keeping
a
dog
and
doing
your
own
barking
i
am
going
to
take
your
breakfast
up
to
you
every
morning
indeed
you
are
not
laughed
anne
i
agree
with
miss
cornelia
that
it
a
scandal
for
a
woman
who
is
sick
to
eat
her
breakfast
in
bed
and
almost
justifies
the
men
in
any
enormities
oh
cornelia
said
susan
with
ineffable
contempt
i
think
you
have
better
sense
mrs
doctor
dear
than
to
heed
what
cornelia
bryant
says
i
can
not
see
why
she
must
be
always
running
down
the
men
even
if
she
is
an
old
maid
am
an
old
maid
but
you
never
hear
me
abusing
the
men
i
like
i
would
have
married
one
if
i
could
is
it
not
funny
nobody
ever
asked
me
to
marry
him
mrs
doctor
dear
i
am
no
beauty
but
i
am
as
as
most
of
the
married
women
you
see
but
i
never
had
a
beau
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
reason
it
may
be
predestination
suggested
anne
with
unearthly
solemnity
susan
nodded
that
is
what
i
have
often
thought
mrs
doctor
dear
and
a
great
comfort
it
is
i
do
not
mind
nobody
wanting
me
if
the
almighty
decreed
it
so
for
his
own
wise
purposes
but
sometimes
doubt
creeps
in
mrs
doctor
dear
and
i
wonder
if
maybe
the
old
scratch
has
not
more
to
do
with
it
than
anyone
else
i
can
not
feel
resigned
then
but
maybe
added
susan
brightening
up
i
will
have
a
chance
to
get
married
yet
i
often
and
often
think
of
the
old
verse
my
aunt
used
to
repeat
there
never
was
a
goose
so
gray
but
sometime
soon
or
late
some
honest
gander
came
her
way
and
took
her
for
his
mate
a
woman
can
not
ever
be
sure
of
not
being
married
till
she
is
buried
mrs
doctor
dear
and
meanwhile
i
will
make
a
batch
of
cherry
pies
i
notice
the
doctor
favors
and
i
do
like
cooking
for
a
man
who
appreciates
his
victuals
miss
cornelia
dropped
in
that
afternoon
puffing
a
little
i
do
mind
the
world
or
the
devil
much
but
the
flesh
does
rather
bother
me
she
admitted
you
always
look
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
anne
dearie
do
i
smell
cherry
pie
if
i
do
ask
me
to
stay
to
tea
have
tasted
a
cherry
pie
this
summer
my
cherries
have
all
been
stolen
by
those
scamps
of
gilman
boys
from
the
glen
now
now
cornelia
remonstrated
captain
jim
who
had
been
reading
a
sea
novel
in
a
corner
of
the
living
room
you
should
say
that
about
those
two
poor
motherless
gilman
boys
unless
you
got
certain
proof
jest
because
their
father
ai
none
too
honest
is
any
reason
for
calling
them
thieves
it
more
likely
it
been
the
robins
took
your
cherries
they
turrible
thick
this
year
robins
said
miss
cornelia
disdainfully
humph
robins
believe
me
well
most
of
the
four
winds
robins
are
constructed
on
that
principle
said
captain
jim
gravely
miss
cornelia
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
then
she
leaned
back
in
her
rocker
and
laughed
long
and
ungrudgingly
well
you
have
got
one
on
me
at
last
jim
boyd
i
admit
just
look
how
pleased
he
is
anne
dearie
grinning
like
a
as
for
the
robins
legs
if
robins
have
great
big
bare
sunburned
legs
with
ragged
trousers
hanging
on
such
as
i
saw
up
in
my
cherry
tree
one
morning
at
sunrise
last
week
i
beg
the
gilman
boys
pardon
by
the
time
i
got
down
they
were
gone
i
could
understand
how
they
had
disappeared
so
quick
but
captain
jim
has
enlightened
me
they
flew
away
of
course
captain
jim
laughed
and
went
away
regretfully
declining
an
invitation
to
stay
to
supper
and
partake
of
cherry
pie
i
on
my
way
to
see
leslie
and
ask
her
if
she
take
a
boarder
miss
cornelia
resumed
i
a
letter
yesterday
from
a
daly
in
toronto
who
boarded
a
spell
with
me
two
years
ago
she
wanted
me
to

hers

summer
his

owen
ford

the
schoolmaster

this
house

selwyn
oldest
daughter

an
ontario
man
named
ford
and
this
is
her

he
wants
to
see
the
old
place
his
grandparents
lived
in
he
had
a
bad
spell
of
typhoid
in
the
spring
and
has
got
rightly
over
it
so
his
doctor
has
ordered
him
to
the
sea
he
does
want
to
go
to
the
hotel
he
just
wants
a
quiet
home
place
i
ca
take
him

letter
to
a
friend

said
miss
cornelia
complacently
it
time
she
had
a
little
holiday
believe
me
she
has
just
about
worked
herself
to
death
tom
holt
can
crochet
beautifully
but
he
ca
make
a
living
for
his
family
he
never
seems
to
be
able
to
get
up
early
enough
to
do
any
work
but
i
notice
he
can
always
get
up
early
to
go
fishing
is
that
like
a
man
anne
smiled
she
had
learned
to
discount
largely
miss
opinions
of
the
four
winds
men
otherwise
she
must
have
believed
them
the
most
hopeless
assortment
of
reprobates
and
in
the
world
with
veritable
slaves
and
martyrs
for
wives
this
particular
tom
holt
for
example
she
knew
to
be
a
kind
husband
a
much
loved
father
and
an
excellent
neighbor
if
he
were
rather
inclined
to
be
lazy
liking
better
the
fishing
he
had
been
born
for
than
the
farming
he
had
not
and
if
he
had
a
harmless
eccentricity
for
doing
fancy
work
nobody
save
miss
cornelia
seemed
to
hold
it
against
him
his
wife
was
a
hustler
who
gloried
in
hustling
his
family
got
a
comfortable
living
off
the
farm
and
his
strapping
sons
and
daughters
inheriting
their
mother
energy
were
all
in
a
fair
way
to
do
well
in
the
world
there
was
not
a
happier
household
in
glen
mary
than
the
holts
miss
cornelia
returned
satisfied
from
the
house
up
the
brook
leslie
going
to
take
him
she
announced
she
jumped
at
the
chance
she
wants
to
make
a
little
money
to
shingle
the
roof
of
her
house
this
fall
and
she
did
know
how
she
was
going
to
manage
it
i
expect
captain
jim
be
more
than
interested
when
he
hears
that
a
grandson
of
the
selwyns
is
coming
here
leslie
said
to
tell
you
she
hankered
after
cherry
pie
but
she
could
come
to
tea
because
she
has
to
go
and
hunt
up
her
turkeys
they
strayed
away
but
she
said
if
there
was
a
piece
left
for
you
to
put
it
in
the
pantry
and
she
run
over
in
the
cat
light
when
prowling
in
order
to
get
it
you
do
know
anne
dearie
what
good
it
did
my
heart
to
hear
leslie
send
you
a
message
like
that
laughing
like
she
used
to
long
ago
there
a
great
change
come
over
her
lately
she
laughs
and
jokes
like
a
girl
and
from
her
talk
i
gather
she
here
real
often
every
day
or
else
i
over
there
said
anne
i
do
know
what
do
without
leslie
especially
just
now
when
gilbert
is
so
busy
hardly
ever
home
except
for
a
few
hours
in
the
wee
sma
he
really
working
himself
to
death
so
many
of
the
people
send
for
him
now
they
might
better
be
content
with
their
own
doctor
said
miss
cornelia
though
to
be
sure
i
ca
blame
them
for
he
a
methodist
ever
since
blythe
brought
allonby
round
folks
think
he
can
raise
the
dead
i
believe
dave
is
a
mite
jealous
just
like
a
man
he
thinks
blythe
has
too
many
notions
i
says
to
him
was
a
notion
saved
rhoda
allonby
if
been
attending
her
she
have
died
and
had
a
tombstone
saying
it
had
pleased
god
to
take
her
away
oh
i
do
like
to
speak
my
mind
to
dave
he
bossed
the
glen
for
years
and
he
thinks
he
forgotten
more
than
other
people
ever
knew
speaking
of
doctors
i
wish
blythe
run
over
and
see
to
that
boil
on
dick
moore
neck
getting
past
leslie
skill
i
sure
i
do
know
what
dick
moore
wants
to
start
in
having
boils
for
as
if
he
was
enough
trouble
without
that
do
you
know
dick
has
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
me
said
anne
he
follows
me
round
like
a
dog
and
smiles
like
a
pleased
child
when
i
notice
him
does
it
make
you
creepy
not
at
all
i
rather
like
poor
dick
moore
he
seems
so
pitiful
and
appealing
somehow
you
would
think
him
very
appealing
if
you
see
him
on
his
cantankerous
days
believe
me
but
i
glad
you
do
mind
him
all
the
nicer
for
leslie
she
have
more
to
do
when
her
boarder
comes
i
hope
he
be
a
decent
creature
you
probably
like
him
he
a
writer
i
wonder
why
people
so
commonly
suppose
that
if
two
individuals
are
both
writers
they
must
therefore
be
hugely
congenial
said
anne
rather
scornfully
nobody
would
expect
two
blacksmiths
to
be
violently
attracted
toward
each
other
merely
because
they
were
both
blacksmiths
nevertheless
she
looked
forward
to
the
advent
of
owen
ford
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
expectation
if
he
were
young
and
likeable
he
might
prove
a
very
pleasant
addition
to
society
in
four
winds
the
of
the
little
house
was
always
out
for
the
race
of
joseph
chapter
owen
ford
comes
one
evening
miss
cornelia
telephoned
down
to
anne
the
writer
man
has
just
arrived
here
i
going
to
drive
him
down
to
your
place
and
you
can
show
him
the
way
over
to
leslie
shorter
than
driving
round
by
the
other
road
and
i
in
a
mortal
hurry
the
reese
baby
has
gone
and
fallen
into
a
pail
of
hot
water
at
the
glen
and
got
nearly
scalded
to
death
and
they
want
me
right
off
to
put
a
new
skin
on
the
child
i
presume
reese
is
always
so
careless
and
then
expects
other
people
to
mend
her
mistakes
you
wo
mind
will
you
dearie
his
trunk
can
go
down
tomorrow
very
well
said
anne
what
is
he
like
miss
cornelia
you
see
what
he
like
outside
when
i
take
him
down
as
for
what
he
like
inside
only
the
lord
who
made
him
knows
that
i
not
going
to
say
another
word
for
every
receiver
in
the
glen
is
down
miss
cornelia
evidently
ca
find
much
fault
with
ford
looks
or
she
would
find
it
in
spite
of
the
receivers
said
anne
i
conclude
therefore
susan
that
ford
is
rather
handsome
than
otherwise
well
mrs
doctor
dear
i
do
enjoy
seeing
a
man
said
susan
candidly
had
i
not
better
get
up
a
snack
for
him
there
is
a
strawberry
pie
that
would
melt
in
your
mouth
no
leslie
is
expecting
him
and
has
his
supper
ready
besides
i
want
that
strawberry
pie
for
my
own
poor
man
he
wo
be
home
till
late
so
leave
the
pie
and
a
glass
of
milk
out
for
him
susan
that
i
will
mrs
doctor
dear
susan
is
at
the
helm
after
all
it
is
better
to
give
pie
to
your
own
men
than
to
strangers
who
may
be
only
seeking
to
devour
and
the
doctor
himself
is
as
a
man
as
you
often
come
across
when
owen
ford
came
anne
secretly
admitted
as
miss
cornelia
towed
him
in
that
he
was
very
indeed
he
was
tall
and
with
thick
brown
hair
nose
and
chin
large
and
brilliant
eyes
and
did
you
notice
his
ears
and
his
teeth
mrs
doctor
dear
queried
susan
later
on
he
has
got
the
ears
i
ever
saw
on
a
man
head
i
am
choice
about
ears
when
i
was
young
i
was
scared
that
i
might
have
to
marry
a
man
with
ears
like
flaps
but
i
need
not
have
worried
for
never
a
chance
did
i
have
with
any
kind
of
ears
anne
had
not
noticed
owen
ford
ears
but
she
did
see
his
teeth
as
his
lips
parted
over
them
in
a
frank
and
friendly
smile
unsmiling
his
face
was
rather
sad
and
absent
in
expression
not
unlike
the
melancholy
inscrutable
hero
of
anne
own
early
dreams
but
mirth
and
humor
and
charm
lighted
it
up
when
he
smiled
certainly
on
the
outside
as
miss
cornelia
said
owen
ford
was
a
very
presentable
fellow
you
can
not
realise
how
delighted
i
am
to
be
here
blythe
he
said
looking
around
him
with
eager
interested
eyes
i
have
an
odd
feeling
of
coming
home
my
mother
was
born
and
spent
her
childhood
here
you
know
she
used
to
talk
a
great
deal
to
me
of
her
old
home
i
know
the
geography
of
it
as
well
as
of
the
one
i
lived
in
and
of
course
she
told
me
the
story
of
the
building
of
the
house
and
of
my
grandfather
agonised
watch
for
the
royal
william
i
had
thought
that
so
old
a
house
must
have
vanished
years
ago
or
i
should
have
come
to
see
it
before
this
old
houses
do
vanish
easily
on
this
enchanted
coast
smiled
anne
this
is
a
where
all
things
always
seem
the
same
nearly
always
at
least
john
selwyn
house
has
even
been
much
changed
and
outside
the
your
grandfather
planted
for
his
bride
are
blooming
this
very
minute
how
the
thought
links
me
with
them
with
your
leave
i
must
explore
the
whole
place
soon
our
will
always
be
out
for
you
promised
anne
and
do
you
know
that
the
old
sea
captain
who
keeps
the
four
winds
light
knew
john
selwyn
and
his
bride
well
in
his
boyhood
he
told
me
their
story
the
night
i
came
here
the
third
bride
of
the
old
house
can
it
be
possible
this
is
a
discovery
i
must
hunt
him
up
it
wo
be
difficult
we
are
all
cronies
of
captain
jim
he
will
be
as
eager
to
see
you
as
you
could
be
to
see
him
your
grandmother
shines
like
a
star
in
his
memory
but
i
think
moore
is
expecting
you
i
show
you
our
road
anne
walked
with
him
to
the
house
up
the
brook
over
a
field
that
was
as
white
as
snow
with
daisies
a
of
people
were
singing
far
across
the
harbor
the
sound
drifted
over
the
water
like
faint
unearthly
music
across
a
starlit
sea
the
big
light
flashed
and
beaconed
owen
ford
looked
around
him
with
satisfaction
and
so
this
is
four
winds
he
said
i
was
prepared
to
find
it
quite
so
beautiful
in
spite
of
all
mother
praises
what
colors
what
scenery
what
charm
i
shall
get
as
strong
as
a
horse
in
no
time
and
if
inspiration
comes
from
beauty
i
should
certainly
be
able
to
begin
my
great
canadian
novel
here
you
have
begun
it
yet
asked
anne
no
i
never
been
able
to
get
the
right
central
idea
for
it
it
lurks
beyond
me
it
allures
and
beckons
and
recedes
i
almost
grasp
it
and
it
is
gone
perhaps
amid
this
peace
and
loveliness
i
shall
be
able
to
capture
it
miss
bryant
tells
me
that
you
write
oh
i
do
little
things
for
children
i
have
done
much
since
i
was
married
and
i
have
no
designs
on
a
great
canadian
novel
laughed
anne
that
is
quite
beyond
me
owen
ford
laughed
too
i
dare
say
it
is
beyond
me
as
well
all
the
same
i
mean
to
have
a
try
at
it
some
day
if
i
can
ever
get
time
a
newspaper
man
does
have
much
chance
for
that
sort
of
thing
i
done
a
good
deal
of
short
story
writing
for
the
magazines
but
i
never
had
the
leisure
that
seems
to
be
necessary
for
the
writing
of
a
book
with
three
months
of
liberty
i
ought
to
make
a
start
though
if
i
could
only
get
the
necessary
motif
for
it
the
soul
of
the
book
an
idea
whisked
through
anne
brain
with
a
suddenness
that
made
her
jump
but
she
did
not
utter
it
for
they
had
reached
the
moore
house
as
they
entered
the
yard
leslie
came
out
on
the
veranda
from
the
side
door
peering
through
the
gloom
for
some
sign
of
her
expected
guest
she
stood
just
where
the
warm
yellow
light
flooded
her
from
the
open
door
she
wore
a
plain
dress
of
cheap
cotton
voile
with
the
usual
girdle
of
crimson
leslie
was
never
without
her
touch
of
crimson
she
had
told
anne
that
she
never
felt
satisfied
without
a
gleam
of
red
somewhere
about
her
if
it
were
only
a
flower
to
anne
it
always
seemed
to
symbolise
leslie
glowing
personality
denied
all
expression
save
in
that
flaming
glint
leslie
dress
was
cut
a
little
away
at
the
neck
and
had
short
sleeves
her
arms
gleamed
like
marble
every
exquisite
curve
of
her
form
was
outlined
in
soft
darkness
against
the
light
her
hair
shone
in
it
like
flame
beyond
her
was
a
purple
sky
flowering
with
stars
over
the
harbor
anne
heard
her
companion
give
a
gasp
even
in
the
dusk
she
could
see
the
amazement
and
admiration
on
his
face
who
is
that
beautiful
creature
he
asked
that
is
moore
said
anne
she
is
very
lovely
is
she
i
i
never
saw
anything
like
her
he
answered
rather
dazedly
i
was
prepared
i
did
expect
good
heavens
one
does
expect
a
goddess
for
a
landlady
why
if
she
were
clothed
in
a
gown
of
with
a
rope
of
amethysts
in
her
hair
she
would
be
a
veritable
and
she
takes
in
boarders
even
goddesses
must
live
said
anne
and
leslie
is
a
goddess
she
just
a
very
beautiful
woman
as
human
as
the
rest
of
us
did
miss
bryant
tell
you
about
mr
moore
yes
he
mentally
deficient
or
something
of
the
sort
is
he
but
she
said
nothing
about
moore
and
i
supposed
she
be
the
usual
hustling
country
housewife
who
takes
in
boarders
to
earn
an
honest
penny
well
that
just
what
leslie
is
doing
said
anne
crisply
and
it
is
altogether
pleasant
for
her
either
i
hope
you
wo
mind
dick
if
you
do
please
do
let
leslie
see
it
it
would
hurt
her
horribly
he
just
a
big
baby
and
sometimes
a
rather
annoying
one
oh
i
wo
mind
him
i
do
suppose
i
be
much
in
the
house
anyhow
except
for
meals
but
what
a
shame
it
all
is
her
life
must
be
a
hard
one
it
is
but
she
does
like
to
be
pitied
leslie
had
gone
back
into
the
house
and
now
met
them
at
the
front
door
she
greeted
owen
ford
with
cold
civility
and
told
him
in
a
tone
that
his
room
and
his
supper
were
ready
for
him
dick
with
a
pleased
grin
shambled
upstairs
with
the
valise
and
owen
ford
was
installed
as
an
inmate
of
the
old
house
among
the
willows
chapter
the
of
captain
jim
i
have
a
little
brown
cocoon
of
an
idea
that
may
possibly
expand
into
a
magnificent
moth
of
fulfilment
anne
told
gilbert
when
she
reached
home
he
had
returned
earlier
than
she
had
expected
and
was
enjoying
susan
cherry
pie
susan
herself
hovered
in
the
background
like
a
rather
grim
but
beneficent
guardian
spirit
and
found
as
much
pleasure
in
watching
gilbert
eat
pie
as
he
did
in
eating
it
what
is
your
idea
he
asked
i
tell
you
just
yet
not
till
i
see
if
i
can
bring
the
thing
about
what
sort
of
a
chap
is
ford
oh
very
nice
and
quite
such
beautiful
ears
doctor
dear
interjected
susan
with
a
relish
he
is
about
thirty
or
i
think
and
he
meditates
writing
a
novel
his
voice
is
pleasant
and
his
smile
delightful
and
he
knows
how
to
dress
he
looks
as
if
life
had
been
altogether
easy
for
him
somehow
owen
ford
came
over
the
next
evening
with
a
note
to
anne
from
leslie
they
spent
the
sunset
time
in
the
garden
and
then
went
for
a
moonlit
sail
on
the
harbor
in
the
little
boat
gilbert
had
set
up
for
summer
outings
they
liked
owen
immensely
and
had
that
feeling
of
having
known
him
for
many
years
which
distinguishes
the
freemasonry
of
the
house
of
joseph
he
is
as
nice
as
his
ears
mrs
doctor
dear
said
susan
when
he
had
gone
he
had
told
susan
that
he
had
never
tasted
anything
like
her
strawberry
shortcake
and
susan
susceptible
heart
was
his
forever
he
has
got
a
way
with
him
she
reflected
as
she
cleared
up
the
relics
of
the
supper
it
is
real
queer
he
is
not
married
for
a
man
like
that
could
have
anybody
for
the
asking
well
maybe
he
is
like
me
and
has
not

henry

chuckled

he
your
face
as
solemn
as
a
tombstone
and
sitting
down
there
with
your
hands

over
your
stomach
and
passing

old
item

but

now
that
you
eased
your
mind
jim
put
on
a
smile
and
tell
me
something
interesting
well
there
it
was
been
so
scared
to
tell
him
and
he
knew
it
all
the
time
strange
how
nature
looks
out
for
us
ai
it
and
lets
us
know
what
we
should
know
when
the
time
comes
did
i
never
tell
you
the
yarn
about
henry
getting
the
fish
hook
in
his
nose
mistress
blythe
no
well
him
and
me
had
a
laugh
over
it
today
it
happened
nigh
unto
thirty
years
ago
him
and
me
and
several
more
was
out
mackerel
fishing
one
day
it
was
a
great
day
never
saw
such
a
school
of
mackerel
in
the
gulf
and
in
the
general
excitement
henry
got
quite
wild
and
contrived
to
stick
a
fish
hook
clean
through
one
side
of
his
nose
well
there
he
was
there
was
barb
on
one
end
and
a
big
piece
of
lead
on
the
other
so
it
could
be
pulled
out
we
wanted
to
take
him
ashore
at
once
but
henry
was
game
he
said
he
be
jiggered
if
leave
a
school
like
that
for
anything
short
of
lockjaw
then
he
kept
fishing
away
hauling
in
hand
over
fist
and
groaning
between
times
the
school
passed
and
we
come
in
with
a
load
i
got
a
file
and
begun
to
try
to
file
through
that
hook
i
tried
to
be
as
easy
as
i
could
but
you
should
have
heard
henry
no
you
should
either
it
was
well
no
ladies
were
around
henry
was
a
swearing
man
but
heard
some
few
matters
of
that
sort
along
shore
in
his
time
and
he
fished
all
out
of
his
recollection
and
hurled
at
me
he
declared
he
could
stand
it
and
i
had
no
bowels
of
compassion
so
we
hitched
up
and
i
drove
him
to
a
doctor
in
charlottetown
miles
there
were
none
nearer
in
them
days
with
that
blessed
hook
still
hanging
from
his
nose
when
we
got
there
old
crabb
jest
took
a
file
and
filed
that
hook
jest
the
same
as
i
tried
to
do
only
he
were
a
mite
particular
about
doing
it
easy
captain
jim
visit
to
his
old
friend
had
revived
many
recollections
and
he
was
now
in
the
full
tide
of
reminiscences
henry
was
asking
me
today
if
i
remembered
the
time
old
father
chiniquy
blessed
alexander
macallister
boat
another
odd
yarn
and
true
as
gospel
i
was
in
the
boat
myself
we
went
out
him
and
me
in
alexander
macallister
boat
one
morning
at
sunrise
besides
there
was
a
french
boy
in
the
boat
catholic
of
course
you
know
old
father
chiniquy
had
turned
protestant
so
the
catholics
had
much
use
for
him
well
we
sat
out
in
the
gulf
in
the
broiling
sun
till
noon
and
not
a
bite
did
we
get
when
we
went
ashore
old
father
chiniquy
had
to
go
so
he
said
in
that
polite
way
of
his
very
sorry
i
can
not
go
out
with
you
dis
afternoon
macallister
but
i
leave
you
my
blessing
you
will
catch
a
dis
afternoon
we
did
not
catch
a
thousand
but
we
caught
exactly
nine
hundred
and
the
biggest
catch
for
a
small
boat
on
the
whole
north
shore
that
summer
curious
was
it
alexander
macallister
he
says
to
andrew
peters
and
what
do
you
think
of
father
chiniquy
now
growled
andrew
de
old
devil
has
got
a
blessing
left
yet
laws
how
henry
did
laugh
over
that
today
do
you
know
who
ford
is
captain
jim
asked
anne
seeing
that
captain
jim
fountain
of
reminiscence
had
run
out
for
the
present
i
want
you
to
guess
captain
jim
shook
his
head
i
never
was
any
hand
at
guessing
mistress
blythe
and
yet
somehow
when
i
come
in
i
thought
have
i
seen
them
eyes
before
for
i
have
seen
think
of
a
september
morning
many
years
ago
said
anne
softly
think
of
a
ship
sailing
up
the
harbor
a
ship
long
waited
for
and
despaired
of
think
of
the
day
the
royal
william
came
in
and
the
first
look
you
had
at
the
schoolmaster
bride
captain
jim
sprang
up
they
persis
selwyn
eyes
he
almost
shouted
you
ca
be
her
son
you
must
be
her
grandson
yes
i
am
alice
selwyn
son
captain
jim
swooped
down
on
owen
ford
and
shook
his
hand
over
again
alice
selwyn
son
lord
but
you
welcome
many
the
time
wondered
where
the
descendants
of
the
schoolmaster
were
living
i
knew
there
was
none
on
the
island
alice
alice
the
first
baby
ever
born
in
that
little
house
no
baby
ever
brought
more
joy
i
dandled
her
a
hundred
times
it
was
from
my
knee
she
took
her
first
steps
alone
ca
i
see
her
mother
face
watching
her
and
it
was
near
sixty
years
ago
is
she
living
yet
no
she
died
when
i
was
only
a
boy
oh
it
does
seem
right
that
i
should
be
living
to
hear
that
sighed
captain
jim
but
i
to
see
you
it
brought
back
my
youth
for
a
little
while
you
do
know
yet
what
a
boon
that
is
mistress
blythe
here
has
the
trick
she
does
it
quite
often
for
me
captain
jim
was
still
more
excited
when
he
discovered
that
owen
ford
was
what
he
called
a
real
writing
man
he
gazed
at
him
as
at
a
superior
being
captain
jim
knew
that
anne
wrote
but
he
had
never
taken
that
fact
very
seriously
captain
jim
thought
women
were
delightful
creatures
who
ought
to
have
the
vote
and
everything
else
they
wanted
bless
their
hearts
but
he
did
not
believe
they
could
write
jest
look
at
a
mad
love
he
would
protest
a
woman
wrote
that
and
jest
look
at
it
one
hundred
and
three
chapters
when
it
could
all
have
been
told
in
ten
a
writing
woman
never
knows
when
to
stop
that
the
trouble
the
of
good
writing
is
to
know
when
to
stop
ford
wants
to
hear
some
of
your
stories
captain
jim
said
anne
tell
him
the
one
about
the
captain
who
went
crazy
and
imagined
he
was
the
flying
dutchman
this
was
captain
jim
best
story
it
was
a
compound
of
horror
and
humor
and
though
anne
had
heard
it
several
times
she
laughed
as
heartily
and
shivered
as
fearsomely
over
it
as
ford
did
other
tales
followed
for
captain
jim
had
an
audience
after
his
own
heart
he
told
how
his
vessel
had
been
run
down
by
a
steamer
how
he
had
been
boarded
by
malay
pirates
how
his
ship
had
caught
fire
how
he
helped
a
political
prisoner
escape
from
a
south
african
republic
how
he
had
been
wrecked
one
fall
on
the
magdalens
and
stranded
there
for
the
winter
how
a
tiger
had
broken
loose
on
board
ship
how
his
crew
had
mutinied
and
marooned
him
on
a
barren
island
these
and
many
other
tales
tragic
or
humorous
or
grotesque
did
captain
jim
relate
the
mystery
of
the
sea
the
fascination
of
far
lands
the
lure
of
adventure
the
laughter
of
the
world
his
hearers
felt
and
realised
them
all
owen
ford
listened
with
his
head
on
his
hand
and
the
first
mate
purring
on
his
knee
his
brilliant
eyes
fastened
on
captain
rugged
eloquent
face
wo
you
let
ford
see
your
captain
jim
asked
anne
when
captain
jim
finally
declared
that
must
end
for
the
time
oh
he
do
want
to
be
bothered
with
that
protested
captain
jim
who
was
secretly
dying
to
show
it
i
should
like
nothing
better
than
to
see
it
captain
boyd
said
owen
if
it
is
half
as
wonderful
as
your
tales
it
will
be
worth
seeing
with
pretended
reluctance
captain
jim
dug
his
out
of
his
old
chest
and
handed
it
to
owen
i
reckon
you
wo
care
to
wrastle
long
with
my
old
hand
o
write
i
never
had
much
schooling
he
observed
carelessly
just
wrote
that
there
to
amuse
my
nephew
joe
he
always
wanting
stories
comes
here
yesterday
and
says
to
me
as
i
was
lifting
a
codfish
out
of
my
boat
jim
ai
a
codfish
a
dumb
animal
i
been
him
you
see
that
he
must
be
real
kind
to
dumb
animals
and
never
hurt
in
any
way
i
got
out
of
the
scrape
by
saying
a
codfish
was
dumb
enough
but
it
was
an
animal
but
joe
did
look
satisfied
and
i
was
satisfied
myself
you
got
to
be
mighty
careful
what
you
tell
them
little
critters
they
can
see
through
you
while
talking
captain
jim
watched
owen
ford
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
as
the
latter
examined
the
and
presently
observing
that
his
guest
was
lost
in
its
pages
he
turned
smilingly
to
his
cupboard
and
proceeded
to
make
a
pot
of
tea
owen
ford
separated
himself
from
the
with
as
much
reluctance
as
a
miser
wrenches
himself
from
his
gold
long
enough
to
drink
his
tea
and
then
returned
to
it
hungrily
oh
you
can
take
that
thing
home
with
you
if
you
want
to
said
captain
jim
as
if
the
thing
were
not
his
most
treasured
possession
i
must
go
down
and
pull
my
boat
up
a
bit
on
the
skids
there
a
wind
coming
did
you
notice
the
sky
tonight
mackerel
skies
and
mares
tails
make
tall
ships
carry
short
sails
owen
ford
accepted
the
offer
of
the
gladly
on
their
way
home
anne
told
him
the
story
of
lost
margaret
that
old
captain
is
a
wonderful
old
fellow
he
said
what
a
life
he
has
led
why
the
man
had
more
adventures
in
one
week
of
his
life
than
most
of
us
have
in
a
lifetime
do
you
really
think
his
tales
are
all
true
i
certainly
do
i
am
sure
captain
jim
could
not
tell
a
lie
and
besides
all
the
people
about
here
say
that
everything
happened
as
he
relates
it
there
used
to
be
plenty
of
his
old
shipmates
alive
to
corroborate
him
he
one
of
the
last
of
the
old
type
of
island
they
are
almost
extinct
now
chapter
the
writing
of
the
book
owen
ford
came
over
to
the
little
house
the
next
morning
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
blythe
this
is
a
wonderful
book
absolutely
wonderful
if
i
could
take
it
and
use
the
material
for
a
book
i
feel
certain
i
could
make
the
novel
of
the
year
out
of
it
do
you
suppose
captain
jim
would
let
me
do
it
let
you
i
sure
he
would
be
delighted
cried
anne
i
admit
that
it
was
what
was
in
my
head
when
i
took
you
down
last
night
captain
jim
has
always
been
wishing
he
could
get
somebody
to
write
his
properly
for
him
will
you
go
down
to
the
point
with
me
this
evening
blythe
ask
him
about
that
myself
but
i
want
you
to
tell
him
that
you
told
me
the
story
of
lost
margaret
and
ask
him
if
he
will
let
me
use
it
as
a
thread
of
romance
with
which
to
weave
the
stories
of
the
into
a
harmonious
whole
captain
jim
was
more
excited
than
ever
when
owen
ford
told
him
of
his
plan
at
last
his
cherished
dream
was
to
be
realized
and
his
given
to
the
world
he
was
also
pleased
that
the
story
of
lost
margaret
should
be
woven
into
it
it
will
keep
her
name
from
being
forgotten
he
said
wistfully
that
why
i
want
it
put
in
we
collaborate
cried
owen
delightedly
you
will
give
the
soul
and
i
the
body
oh
we
write
a
famous
book
between
us
captain
jim
and
we
get
right
to
work
and
to
think
my
book
is
to
be
writ
by
the
schoolmaster
grandson
exclaimed
captain
jim
lad
your
grandfather
was
my
dearest
friend
i
thought
there
was
nobody
like
him
i
see
now
why
i
had
to
wait
so
long
it
could
be
writ
till
the
right
man
come
you
belong
here
you
got
the
soul
of
this
old
north
shore
in
you
you
the
only
one
who
could
write
it
it
was
arranged
that
the
tiny
room
off
the
living
room
at
the
lighthouse
should
be
given
over
to
owen
for
a
workshop
it
was
necessary
that
captain
jim
should
be
near
him
as
he
wrote
for
consultation
upon
many
matters
of
and
gulf
lore
of
which
owen
was
quite
ignorant
he
began
work
on
the
book
the
very
next
morning
and
flung
himself
into
it
heart
and
soul
as
for
captain
jim
he
was
a
happy
man
that
summer
he
looked
upon
the
little
room
where
owen
worked
as
a
sacred
shrine
owen
talked
everything
over
with
captain
jim
but
he
would
not
let
him
see
the
manuscript
you
must
wait
until
it
is
published
he
said
then
you
get
it
all
at
once
in
its
best
shape
he
delved
into
the
treasures
of
the
and
used
them
freely
he
dreamed
and
brooded
over
lost
margaret
until
she
became
a
vivid
reality
to
him
and
lived
in
his
pages
as
the
book
progressed
it
took
possession
of
him
and
he
worked
at
it
with
feverish
eagerness
he
let
anne
and
leslie
read
the
manuscript
and
criticise
it
and
the
concluding
chapter
of
the
book
which
the
critics
later
on
were
pleased
to
call
idyllic
was
modelled
upon
a
suggestion
of
leslie
anne
fairly
hugged
herself
with
delight
over
the
success
of
her
idea
i
knew
when
i
looked
at
owen
ford
that
he
was
the
very
man
for
it
she
told
gilbert
both
humor
and
passion
were
in
his
face
and
that
together
with
the
art
of
expression
was
just
what
was
necessary
for
the
writing
of
such
a
book
as
rachel
would
say
he
was
predestined
for
the
part
owen
ford
wrote
in
the
mornings
the
afternoons
were
generally
spent
in
some
merry
outing
with
the
blythes
leslie
often
went
too
for
captain
jim
took
charge
of
dick
frequently
in
order
to
set
her
free
they
went
boating
on
the
harbor
and
up
the
three
pretty
rivers
that
flowed
into
it
they
had
clambakes
on
the
bar
and
on
the
rocks
they
picked
strawberries
on
the
they
went
out
with
captain
jim
they
shot
plover
in
the
shore
fields
and
wild
ducks
in
the
cove
at
least
the
men
did
in
the
evenings
they
rambled
in
the
daisied
shore
fields
under
a
golden
moon
or
they
sat
in
the
living
room
at
the
little
house
where
often
the
coolness
of
the
sea
breeze
justified
a
driftwood
fire
and
talked
of
the
thousand
and
one
things
which
happy
eager
clever
young
people
can
find
to
talk
about
ever
since
the
day
on
which
she
had
made
her
confession
to
anne
leslie
had
been
a
changed
creature
there
was
no
trace
of
her
old
coldness
and
reserve
no
shadow
of
her
old
bitterness
the
girlhood
of
which
she
had
been
cheated
seemed
to
come
back
to
her
with
the
ripeness
of
womanhood
she
expanded
like
a
flower
of
flame
and
perfume
no
laugh
was
readier
than
hers
no
wit
quicker
in
the
twilight
circles
of
that
enchanted
summer
when
she
could
not
be
with
them
all
felt
that
some
exquisite
savor
was
lacking
in
their
intercourse
her
beauty
was
illumined
by
the
awakened
soul
within
as
some
rosy
lamp
might
shine
through
a
flawless
vase
of
alabaster
there
were
hours
when
eyes
seemed
to
ache
with
the
splendor
of
her
as
for
owen
ford
the
margaret
of
his
book
although
she
had
the
soft
brown
hair
and
elfin
face
of
the
real
girl
who
had
vanished
so
long
ago
pillowed
where
lost
atlantis
sleeps
had
the
personality
of
leslie
moore
as
it
was
revealed
to
him
in
those
halcyon
days
at
four
winds
harbor
all
in
all
it
was
a
summer
one
of
those
summers
which
come
seldom
into
any
life
but
leave
a
rich
heritage
of
beautiful
memories
in
their
going
one
of
those
summers
which
in
a
fortunate
combination
of
delightful
weather
delightful
friends
and
delightful
doings
come
as
near
to
perfection
as
anything
can
come
in
this
world
too
good
to
last
anne
told
herself
with
a
little
sigh
on
the
september
day
when
a
certain
nip
in
the
wind
and
a
certain
shade
of
intense
blue
on
the
gulf
water
said
that
autumn
was
hard
by
that
evening
owen
ford
told
them
that
he
had
finished
his
book
and
that
his
vacation
must
come
to
an
end
i
have
a
good
deal
to
do
to
it
yet
revising
and
pruning
and
so
forth
he
said
but
in
the
main
it
done
i
wrote
the
last
sentence
this
morning
if
i
can
find
a
publisher
for
it
it
will
probably
be
out
next
summer
or
fall
owen
had
not
much
doubt
that
he
would
find
a
publisher
he
knew
that
he
had
written
a
great
book
a
book
that
would
score
a
wonderful
success
a
book
that
would
live
he
knew
that
it
would
bring
him
both
fame
and
fortune
but
when
he
had
written
the
last
line
of
it
he
had
bowed
his
head
on
the
manuscript
and
so
sat
for
a
long
time
and
his
thoughts
were
not
of
the
good
work
he
had
done
chapter
owen
ford
confession
i
so
sorry
gilbert
is
away
said
anne
he
had
to
go
allan
lyons
at
the
glen
has
met
with
a
serious
accident
he
will
not
likely
be
home
till
very
late
but
he
told
me
to
tell
you
he
be
up
and
over
early
enough
in
the
morning
to
see
you
before
you
left
it
too
provoking
susan
and
i
had
planned
such
a
nice
little
jamboree
for
your
last
night
here
she
was
sitting
beside
the
garden
brook
on
the
little
rustic
seat
gilbert
had
built
owen
ford
stood
before
her
leaning
against
the
bronze
column
of
a
yellow
birch
he
was
very
pale
and
his
face
bore
the
marks
of
the
preceding
sleepless
night
anne
glancing
up
at
him
wondered
if
after
all
his
summer
had
brought
him
the
strength
it
should
had
he
worked
too
hard
over
his
book
she
remembered
that
for
a
week
he
had
not
been
looking
well
i
rather
glad
the
doctor
is
away
said
owen
slowly
i
wanted
to
see
you
alone
blythe
there
is
something
i
must
tell
somebody
or
i
think
it
will
drive
me
mad
i
been
trying
for
a
week
to
look
it
in
the
face
and
i
ca
i
know
i
can
trust
you
and
besides
you
will
understand
a
woman
with
eyes
like
yours
always
understands
you
are
one
of
the
folks
people
instinctively
tell
things
to
blythe
i
love
leslie
love
her
that
seems
too
weak
a
word
his
voice
suddenly
broke
with
the
suppressed
passion
of
his
utterance
he
turned
his
head
away
and
hid
his
face
on
his
arm
his
whole
form
shook
anne
sat
looking
at
him
pale
and
aghast
she
had
never
thought
of
this
and
yet
how
was
it
she
had
never
thought
of
it
it
now
seemed
a
natural
and
inevitable
thing
she
wondered
at
her
own
blindness
but
but
things
like
this
did
not
happen
in
four
winds
elsewhere
in
the
world
human
passions
might
set
at
defiance
human
conventions
and
laws
but
not
here
surely
leslie
had
kept
summer
boarders
off
and
on
for
ten
years
and
nothing
like
this
had
happened
but
perhaps
they
had
not
been
like
owen
ford
and
the
vivid
living
leslie
of
this
summer
was
not
the
cold
sullen
girl
of
other
years
oh
somebody
should
have
thought
of
this
why
had
miss
cornelia
thought
of
it
miss
cornelia
was
always
ready
enough
to
sound
the
alarm
where
men
were
concerned
anne
felt
an
unreasonable
resentment
against
miss
cornelia
then
she
gave
a
little
inward
groan
no
matter
who
was
to
blame
the
mischief
was
done
and
leslie
what
of
leslie
it
was
for
leslie
anne
felt
most
concerned
does
leslie
know
this
mr
ford
she
asked
quietly
no
no
unless
she
has
guessed
it
you
surely
do
think
i
be
cad
and
scoundrel
enough
to
tell
her
blythe
i
could
help
loving
her
that
all
and
my
misery
is
greater
than
i
can
bear
does
she
care
asked
anne
the
moment
the
question
crossed
her
lips
she
felt
that
she
should
not
have
asked
it
owen
ford
answered
it
with
overeager
protest
no
no
of
course
not
but
i
could
make
her
care
if
she
were
free
i
know
i
could
she
does
care
and
he
knows
it
thought
anne
aloud
she
said
sympathetically
but
decidedly
but
she
is
not
free
ford
and
the
only
thing
you
can
do
is
to
go
away
in
silence
and
leave
her
to
her
own
life
i
know
i
know
groaned
owen
he
sat
down
on
the
grassy
bank
and
stared
moodily
into
the
amber
water
beneath
him
i
know
nothing
to
do
nothing
but
to
say
conventionally
moore
thank
you
for
all
your
kindness
to
me
this
summer
just
as
i
would
have
said
it
to
the
sonsy
bustling
housewife
i
expected
her
to
be
when
i
came
then
i
pay
my
board
money
like
any
honest
boarder
and
go
oh
it
very
simple
no
doubt
no
perplexity
a
straight
road
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
i
walk
it
you
need
fear
that
i
wo
blythe
but
it
would
be
easier
to
walk
over
ploughshares
anne
flinched
with
the
pain
of
his
voice
and
there
was
so
little
she
could
say
that
would
be
adequate
to
the
situation
blame
was
out
of
the
question
advice
was
not
needed
sympathy
was
mocked
by
the
stark
agony
she
could
only
feel
with
him
in
a
maze
of
compassion
and
regret
her
heart
ached
for
leslie
had
not
that
poor
girl
suffered
enough
without
this
it
would
be
so
hard
to
go
and
leave
her
if
she
were
only
happy
resumed
owen
passionately
but
to
think
of
her
living
death
to
realise
what
it
is
to
which
i
do
leave
her
that
is
the
worst
of
all
i
would
give
my
life
to
make
her
happy
and
i
can
do
nothing
even
to
help
her
nothing
she
is
bound
forever
to
that
poor
wretch
with
nothing
to
look
forward
to
but
growing
old
in
a
succession
of
empty
meaningless
barren
years
it
drives
me
mad
to
think
of
it
but
i
must
go
through
my
life
never
seeing
her
but
always
knowing
what
she
is
enduring
it
hideous
hideous
it
is
very
hard
said
anne
sorrowfully
we
her
friends
here
all
know
how
hard
it
is
for
her
and
she
is
so
richly
fitted
for
life
said
owen
rebelliously
her
beauty
is
the
least
of
her
dower
and
she
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
ever
known
that
laugh
of
hers
i
angled
all
summer
to
evoke
that
laugh
just
for
the
delight
of
hearing
it
and
her
eyes
they
are
as
deep
and
blue
as
the
gulf
out
there
i
never
saw
such
blueness
and
gold
did
you
ever
see
her
hair
down
mrs
blythe
no
i
did
once
i
had
gone
down
to
the
point
to
go
fishing
with
captain
jim
but
it
was
too
rough
to
go
out
so
i
came
back
she
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
what
she
expected
to
be
an
afternoon
alone
to
wash
her
hair
and
she
was
standing
on
the
veranda
in
the
sunshine
to
dry
it
it
fell
all
about
her
to
her
feet
in
a
fountain
of
living
gold
when
she
saw
me
she
hurried
in
and
the
wind
caught
her
hair
and
swirled
it
all
around
her
danae
in
her
cloud
somehow
just
then
the
knowledge
that
i
loved
her
came
home
to
me
and
realised
that
i
had
loved
her
from
the
moment
i
first
saw
her
standing
against
the
darkness
in
that
glow
of
light
and
she
must
live
on
here
petting
and
soothing
dick
pinching
and
saving
for
a
mere
existence
while
i
spend
my
life
longing
vainly
for
her
and
debarred
by
that
very
fact
from
even
giving
her
the
little
help
a
friend
might
i
walked
the
shore
last
night
almost
till
dawn
and
thrashed
it
all
out
over
and
over
again
and
yet
in
spite
of
everything
i
ca
find
it
in
my
heart
to
be
sorry
that
i
came
to
four
winds
it
seems
to
me
that
bad
as
everything
is
it
would
be
still
worse
never
to
have
known
leslie
it
burning
searing
pain
to
love
her
and
leave
her
but
not
to
have
loved
her
is
unthinkable
i
suppose
all
this
sounds
very
crazy
all
these
terrible
emotions
always
do
sound
foolish
when
we
put
them
into
our
inadequate
words
they
are
not
meant
to
be
spoken
only
felt
and
endured
i
should
have
spoken
but
it
has
helped
some
at
least
it
has
given
me
strength
to
go
away
respectably
tomorrow
morning
without
making
a
scene
you
write
me
now
and
then
wo
you
blythe
and
give
me
what
news
there
is
to
give
of
her
yes
said
anne
oh
i
so
sorry
you
are
going
we
miss
you
so
we
all
been
such
friends
if
it
were
not
for
this
you
could
come
back
other
summers
perhaps
even
yet
when
forgotten
perhaps
i
shall
never
forget
and
i
shall
never
come
back
to
four
winds
said
owen
briefly
silence
and
twilight
fell
over
the
garden
far
away
the
sea
was
lapping
gently
and
monotonously
on
the
bar
the
wind
of
evening
in
the
poplars
sounded
like
some
sad
weird
old
rune
some
broken
dream
of
old
memories
a
slender
shapely
young
aspen
rose
up
before
them
against
the
fine
maize
and
emerald
and
paling
rose
of
the
western
sky
which
brought
out
every
leaf
and
twig
in
dark
tremulous
elfin
loveliness
is
that
beautiful
said
owen
pointing
to
it
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
puts
a
certain
conversation
behind
him
it
so
beautiful
that
it
hurts
me
said
anne
softly
perfect
things
like
that
always
did
hurt
me
i
remember
i
called
it
queer
ache
when
i
was
a
child
what
is
the
reason
that
pain
like
this
seems
inseparable
from
perfection
is
it
the
pain
of
finality
when
we
realise
that
there
can
be
nothing
beyond
but
retrogression
perhaps
said
owen
dreamily
it
is
the
prisoned
infinite
in
us
calling
out
to
its
kindred
infinite
as
expressed
in
that
visible
perfection
you
seem
to
have
a
cold
in
the
head
better
rub
some
tallow
on
your
nose
when
you
go
to
bed
said
miss
cornelia
who
had
come
in
through
the
little
gate
between
the
firs
in
time
to
catch
owen
last
remark
miss
cornelia
liked
owen
but
it
was
a
matter
of
principle
with
her
to
visit
any
language
from
a
man
with
a
snub
miss
cornelia
personated
the
comedy
that
ever
peeps
around
the
corner
at
the
tragedy
of
life
anne
whose
nerves
had
been
rather
strained
laughed
hysterically
and
even
owen
smiled
certainly
sentiment
and
passion
had
a
way
of
shrinking
out
of
sight
in
miss
presence
and
yet
to
anne
nothing
seemed
quite
as
hopeless
and
dark
and
painful
as
it
had
seemed
a
few
moments
before
but
sleep
was
far
from
her
eyes
that
night
chapter
on
the
sand
bar
owen
ford
left
four
winds
the
next
morning
in
the
evening
anne
went
over
to
see
leslie
but
found
nobody
the
house
was
locked
and
there
was
no
light
in
any
window
it
looked
like
a
home
left
soulless
leslie
did
not
run
over
on
the
following
day
which
anne
thought
a
bad
sign
gilbert
having
occasion
to
go
in
the
evening
to
the
fishing
cove
anne
drove
with
him
to
the
point
intending
to
stay
awhile
with
captain
jim
but
the
great
light
cutting
its
swathes
through
the
fog
of
the
autumn
evening
was
in
care
of
alec
boyd
and
captain
jim
was
away
what
will
you
do
asked
gilbert
come
with
me
i
do
want
to
go
to
the
cove
but
i
go
over
the
channel
with
you
and
roam
about
on
the
sand
shore
till
you
come
back
the
rock
shore
is
too
slippery
and
grim
tonight
alone
on
the
sands
of
the
bar
anne
gave
herself
up
to
the
eerie
charm
of
the
night
it
was
warm
for
september
and
the
late
afternoon
had
been
very
foggy
but
a
full
moon
had
in
part
lessened
the
fog
and
transformed
the
harbor
and
the
gulf
and
the
surrounding
shores
into
a
strange
fantastic
unreal
world
of
pale
silver
mist
through
which
everything
loomed
captain
josiah
crawford
black
schooner
sailing
down
the
channel
laden
with
potatoes
for
bluenose
ports
was
a
spectral
ship
bound
for
a
far
uncharted
land
ever
receding
never
to
be
reached
the
calls
of
unseen
gulls
overhead
were
the
cries
of
the
souls
of
doomed
seamen
the
little
curls
of
foam
that
blew
across
the
sand
were
elfin
things
stealing
up
from
the
the
big
were
the
sleeping
giants
of
some
old
northern
tale
the
lights
that
glimmered
palely
across
the
harbor
were
the
delusive
beacons
on
some
coast
of
fairyland
anne
pleased
herself
with
a
hundred
fancies
as
she
wandered
through
the
mist
it
was
delightful
romantic
mysterious
to
be
roaming
here
alone
on
this
enchanted
shore
but
was
she
alone
something
loomed
in
the
mist
before
her
took
shape
and
form
suddenly
moved
towards
her
across
the
sand
leslie
exclaimed
anne
in
amazement
whatever
are
you
doing
here
tonight
if
it
comes
to
that
whatever
are
you
doing
here
said
leslie
trying
to
laugh
the
effort
was
a
failure
she
looked
very
pale
and
tired
but
the
love
locks
under
her
scarlet
cap
were
curling
about
her
face
and
eyes
like
little
sparkling
rings
of
gold
i
waiting
for
gilbert
he
over
at
the
cove
i
intended
to
stay
at
the
light
but
captain
jim
is
away
well
came
here
because
i
wanted
to
walk
and
walk
and
walk
said
leslie
restlessly
i
could
on
the
rock
shore
the
tide
was
too
high
and
the
rocks
prisoned
me
i
had
to
come
here
or
i
should
have
gone
mad
i
think
i
rowed
myself
over
the
channel
in
captain
jim
flat
i
been
here
for
an
hour
come
come
let
us
walk
i
ca
stand
still
oh
anne
leslie
dearest
what
is
the
trouble
asked
anne
though
she
knew
too
well
already
i
ca
tell
you
do
ask
me
i
would
mind
your
knowing
i
wish
you
did
know
but
i
ca
tell
you
i
ca
tell
anyone
i
been
such
a
fool
anne
and
oh
it
hurts
so
terribly
to
be
a
fool
nothing
so
painful
in
the
world
she
laughed
bitterly
anne
slipped
her
arm
around
her
leslie
is
it
that
you
have
learned
to
care
for
mr
ford
leslie
turned
herself
about
passionately
how
did
you
know
she
cried
anne
how
did
you
know
oh
is
it
written
in
my
face
for
everyone
to
see
is
it
as
plain
as
that
no
no
i
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
knew
it
just
came
into
my
mind
somehow
leslie
do
look
at
me
like
that
do
you
despise
me
demanded
leslie
in
a
fierce
low
tone
do
you
think
i
wicked
unwomanly
or
do
you
think
i
just
plain
fool
i
do
think
you
any
of
those
things
come
dear
let
just
talk
it
over
sensibly
as
we
might
talk
over
any
other
of
the
great
crises
of
life
you
been
brooding
over
it
and
let
yourself
drift
into
a
morbid
view
of
it
you
know
you
have
a
little
tendency
to
do
that
about
everything
that
goes
wrong
and
you
promised
me
that
you
would
fight
against
it
but
oh
it
so
so
shameful
murmured
leslie
to
love
him
unsought
and
when
i
not
free
to
love
anybody
there
nothing
shameful
about
it
but
i
very
sorry
that
you
have
learned
to
care
for
owen
because
as
things
are
it
will
only
make
you
more
unhappy
i
did
learn
to
care
said
leslie
walking
on
and
speaking
passionately
if
it
had
been
like
that
i
could
have
prevented
it
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
until
that
day
a
week
ago
when
he
told
me
he
had
finished
his
book
and
must
soon
go
away
then
then
i
knew
i
felt
as
if
someone
had
struck
me
a
terrible
blow
i
did
say
anything
i
could
speak
but
i
do
know
what
i
looked
like
so
afraid
my
face
betrayed
me
oh
i
would
die
of
shame
if
i
thought
he
knew
or
suspected
anne
was
miserably
silent
hampered
by
her
deductions
from
her
conversation
with
owen
leslie
went
on
feverishly
as
if
she
found
relief
in
speech
i
was
so
happy
all
this
summer
anne
happier
than
i
ever
was
in
my
life
i
thought
it
was
because
everything
had
been
made
clear
between
you
and
me
and
that
it
was
our
friendship
which
made
life
seem
so
beautiful
and
full
once
more
and
it
was
in
part
but
not
all
oh
not
nearly
all
i
know
now
why
everything
was
so
different
and
now
it
all
over
and
he
has
gone
how
can
i
live
anne
when
i
turned
back
into
the
house
this
morning
after
he
had
gone
the
solitude
struck
me
like
a
blow
in
the
face
it
wo
seem
so
hard
by
and
by
dear
said
anne
who
always
felt
the
pain
of
her
friends
so
keenly
that
she
could
not
speak
easy
fluent
words
of
comforting
besides
she
remembered
how
speeches
had
hurt
her
in
her
own
sorrow
and
was
afraid
oh
it
seems
to
me
it
will
grow
harder
all
the
time
said
leslie
miserably
i
nothing
to
look
forward
to
morning
will
come
after
morning
and
he
will
not
come
back
he
will
never
come
back
oh
when
i
think
that
i
will
never
see
him
again
i
feel
as
if
a
great
brutal
hand
had
twisted
itself
among
my
heartstrings
and
was
wrenching
them
once
long
ago
i
dreamed
of
love
and
i
thought
it
must
be
beautiful
and
now
its
like
this
when
he
went
away
yesterday
morning
he
was
so
cold
and
indifferent
he
said
moore
in
the
coldest
tone
in
the
world
as
if
we
had
not
even
been
friends
as
if
i
meant
absolutely
nothing
to
him
i
know
i
do
i
did
want
him
to
care
but
he
might
have
been
a
little
kinder
oh
i
wish
gilbert
would
come
thought
anne
she
was
racked
between
her
sympathy
for
leslie
and
the
necessity
of
avoiding
anything
that
would
betray
owen
confidence
she
knew
why
his
had
been
so
cold
why
it
could
not
have
the
cordiality
that
their
demanded
but
she
could
not
tell
leslie
i
could
help
it
anne
i
could
help
it
said
poor
leslie
i
know
that
do
you
blame
me
so
very
much
i
do
blame
you
at
all
and
you
wo
you
wo
tell
gilbert
leslie
do
you
think
i
would
do
such
a
thing
oh
i
do
know
you
and
gilbert
are
such
chums
i
do
see
how
you
could
help
telling
him
everything
everything
about
my
own
concerns
yes
but
not
my
friends
secrets
i
could
have
him
know
but
i
glad
you
know
i
would
feel
guilty
if
there
were
anything
i
was
ashamed
to
tell
you
i
hope
miss
cornelia
wo
find
out
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
those
terrible
kind
brown
eyes
of
hers
read
my
very
soul
oh
i
wish
this
mist
would
never
lift
i
wish
i
could
just
stay
in
it
forever
hidden
away
from
every
living
being
i
do
see
how
i
can
go
on
with
life
this
summer
has
been
so
full
i
never
was
lonely
for
a
moment
before
owen
came
there
used
to
be
horrible
moments
when
i
had
been
with
you
and
gilbert
and
then
had
to
leave
you
you
two
would
walk
away
together
and
i
would
walk
away
alone
after
owen
came
he
was
always
there
to
walk
home
with
me
we
would
laugh
and
talk
as
you
and
gilbert
were
doing
there
were
no
more
lonely
envious
moments
for
me
and
now
oh
yes
i
been
a
fool
let
have
done
talking
about
my
folly
i
never
bore
you
with
it
again
here
is
gilbert
and
you
are
coming
back
with
us
said
anne
who
had
no
intention
of
leaving
leslie
to
wander
alone
on
the
on
such
a
night
and
in
such
a
mood
there
plenty
of
room
in
our
boat
for
three
and
we
tie
the
flat
on
behind
oh
i
suppose
i
must
reconcile
myself
to
being
the
odd
one
again
said
poor
leslie
with
another
bitter
laugh
forgive
me
anne
that
was
hateful
i
ought
to
be
thankful
and
i
am
that
i
have
two
good
friends
who
are
glad
to
count
me
in
as
a
third
do
mind
my
hateful
speeches
i
just
seem
to
be
one
great
pain
all
over
and
everything
hurts
me
leslie
seemed
very
quiet
tonight
did
she
said
gilbert
when
he
and
anne
reached
home
what
in
the
world
was
she
doing
over
there
on
the
bar
alone
oh
she
was
tired
and
you
know
she
likes
to
go
to
the
shore
after
one
of
dick
bad
days
what
a
pity
she
had
met
and
married
a
fellow
like
ford
long
ago
ruminated
gilbert
they
have
made
an
ideal
couple
would
they
for
pity
sake
gilbert
do
develop
into
a
it
an
abominable
profession
for
a
man
cried
anne
rather
sharply
afraid
that
gilbert
might
blunder
on
the
truth
if
he
kept
on
in
this
strain
bless
us
i
not
matchmaking
protested
gilbert
rather
surprised
at
her
tone
i
was
only
thinking
of
one
of
the
well
do
it
a
waste
of
time
said
anne
then
she
added
suddenly
oh
gilbert
i
wish
everybody
could
be
as
happy
as
we
are
chapter
odds
and
ends
i
been
reading
obituary
notices
said
miss
cornelia
laying
down
the
daily
enterprise
and
taking
up
her
sewing
the
harbor
was
lying
black
and
sullen
under
a
dour
november
sky
the
wet
dead
leaves
clung
drenched
and
sodden
to
the
window
sills
but
the
little
house
was
gay
with
firelight
and
with
anne
ferns
and
geraniums
it
always
summer
here
anne
leslie
had
said
one
day
and
all
who
were
the
guests
of
that
house
of
dreams
felt
the
same
the
enterprise
seems
to
run
to
obituaries
these
days
quoth
miss
cornelia
it
always
has
a
couple
of
columns
of
them
and
i
read
every
line
it
one
of
my
forms
of
recreation
especially
when
there
some
original
poetry
attached
to
them
here
a
choice
sample
for
you
she
gone
to
be
with
her
maker
never
more
to
roam
she
used
to
play
and
sing
with
joy
the
song
of
home
sweet
home
who
says
we
have
any
poetical
talent
on
the
island
have
you
ever
noticed
what
heaps
of
good
people
die
anne
dearie
it
kind
of
pitiful
here
ten
obituaries
and
every
one
of
them
saints
and
models
even
the
men
here
old
peter
stimson
who
has
a
large
circle
of
friends
to
mourn
his
untimely
loss
lord
anne
dearie
that
man
was
eighty
and
everybody
who
knew
him
had
been
wishing
him
dead
these
thirty
years
read
obituaries
when
you
blue
anne
dearie
especially
the
ones
of
folks
you
know
if
you
any
sense
of
humor
at
all
they
cheer
you
up
believe
me
i
just
wish
had
the
writing
of
the
obituaries
of
some
people
is
an
awful
ugly
word
this
very
peter
i
been
speaking
of
had
a
face
exactly
like
one
i
never
saw
it
but
i
thought
of
the
word
obituary
then
and
there
there
only
one
uglier
word
that
i
know
of
and
that
relict
lord
anne
dearie
i
may
be
an
old
maid
but
there
this
comfort
in
it
i
never
be
any
man
it
is
an
ugly
word
said
anne
laughing
avonlea
graveyard
was
full
of
old
tombstones
to
the
memory
of
relict
of
the
late
it
always
made
me
think
of
something
worn
out
and
moth
eaten
why
is
it
that
so
many
of
the
words
connected
with
death
are
so
disagreeable
i
do
wish
that
the
custom
of
calling
a
dead
body
remains
could
be
abolished
i
positively
shiver
when
i
hear
the
undertaker
say
at
a
funeral
who
wish
to
see
the
remains
please
step
this
way
it
always
gives
me
the
horrible
impression
that
i
am
about
to
view
the
scene
of
a
cannibal
feast
well
all
i
hope
said
miss
cornelia
calmly
is
that
when
i
dead
nobody
will
call
me
departed
sister
i
took
a
scunner
at
this
business
five
years
ago
when
there
was
a
travelling
evangelist
holding
meetings
at
the
glen
i
had
any
use
for
him
from
the
start
i
felt
in
my
bones
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
him
and
there
was
mind
you
he
was
pretending
to
be
a
presbyterian
presbytarian
he
called
it
and
all
the
time
he
was
a
methodist
he
brothered
and
sistered
everybody
he
had
a
large
circle
of
relations
that
man
had
he
clutched
my
hand
fervently
one
night
and
said
imploringly
dear
sister
bryant
are
you
a
christian
i
just
looked
him
over
a
bit
and
then
i
said
calmly
only
brother
i
ever
had
fiske
was
buried
fifteen
years
ago
and
i
adopted
any
since
as
for
being
a
christian
i
was
that
i
hope
and
believe
when
you
were
crawling
about
the
floor
in
petticoats
that
squelched
him
believe
me
mind
you
anne
dearie
i
not
down
on
all
evangelists
we
had
some
real
fine
earnest
men
who
did
a
lot
of
good
and
made
the
old
sinners
squirm
but
this
was
one
of
them
i
had
a
good
laugh
all
to
myself
one
evening
fiske
had
asked
all
who
were
christians
to
stand
up
did
believe
me
i
never
had
any
use
for
that
sort
of
thing
but
most
of
them
did
and
then
he
asked
all
who
wanted
to
be
christians
to
stand
up
nobody
stirred
for
a
spell
so
fiske
started
up
a
hymn
at
the
top
of
his
voice
just
in
front
of
me
poor
little
ikey
baker
was
sitting
in
the
millison
pew
he
was
a
home
boy
ten
years
old
and
millison
just
about
worked
him
to
death
the
poor
little
creature
was
always
so
tired
he
fell
asleep
right
off
whenever
he
went
to
church
or
anywhere
he
could
sit
still
for
a
few
minutes
he
been
sleeping
all
through
the
meeting
and
i
was
thankful
to
see
the
poor
child
getting
a
rest
believe
me
well
when
fiske
voice
went
soaring
skyward
and
the
rest
joined
in
poor
ikey
wakened
with
a
start
he
thought
it
was
just
an
ordinary
singing
and
that
everybody
ought
to
stand
up
so
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
mighty
quick
knowing
he
get
a
combing
down
from
maria
millison
for
sleeping
in
meeting
fiske
saw
him
stopped
and
shouted
soul
saved
glory
hallelujah
and
there
was
poor
frightened
ikey
only
half
awake
and
yawning
never
thinking
about
his
soul
at
all
poor
child
he
never
had
time
to
think
of
anything
but
his
tired
overworked
little
body
leslie
went
one
night
and
the
got
right
after
her
oh
he
was
especially
anxious
about
the
souls
of
the
girls
believe
me
and
he
hurt
her
feelings
so
she
never
went
again
and
then
he
prayed
every
night
after
that
right
in
public
that
the
lord
would
soften
her
hard
heart
finally
i
went
to
leavitt
our
minister
then
and
told
him
if
he
did
make
fiske
stop
that
i
just
rise
up
the
next
night
and
throw
my
hymn
book
at
him
when
he
mentioned
that
but
unrepentant
young
woman
i
have
done
it
too
believe
me
leavitt
did
put
a
stop
to
it
but
fiske
kept
on
with
his
meetings
until
charley
douglas
put
an
end
to
his
career
in
the
glen
charley
had
been
out
in
california
all
winter
she
been
real
melancholy
in
the
fall
religious
melancholy
it
ran
in
her
family
her
father
worried
so
much
over
believing
that
he
had
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
that
he
died
in
the
asylum
so
when
rose
douglas
got
that
way
charley
packed
her
off
to
visit
her
sister
in
los
angeles
she
got
perfectly
well
and
came
home
just
when
the
fiske
revival
was
in
full
swing
she
stepped
off
the
train
at
the
glen
real
smiling
and
chipper
and
the
first
thing
she
saw
staring
her
in
the
face
on
the
black
of
the
freight
shed
was
the
question
in
big
white
letters
two
feet
high
goest
thou
to
heaven
or
hell
that
had
been
one
of
fiske
ideas
and
he
had
got
henry
hammond
to
paint
it
rose
just
gave
a
shriek
and
fainted
and
when
they
got
her
home
she
was
worse
than
ever
charley
douglas
went
to
leavitt
and
told
him
that
every
douglas
would
leave
the
church
if
fiske
was
kept
there
any
longer
leavitt
had
to
give
in
for
the
douglases
paid
half
his
salary
so
fiske
departed
and
we
had
to
depend
on
our
bibles
once
more
for
instructions
on
how
to
get
to
heaven
after
he
was
gone
leavitt
found
out
he
was
just
a
masquerading
methodist
and
he
felt
pretty
sick
believe
me
leavitt
fell
short
in
some
ways
but
he
was
a
good
sound
presbyterian
by
the
way
i
had
a
letter
from
ford
yesterday
said
anne
he
asked
me
to
remember
him
kindly
to
you
i
do
want
his
remembrances
said
miss
cornelia
curtly
why
said
anne
in
astonishment
i
thought
you
liked
him
well
so
i
did
in
a
kind
of
way
but
i
never
forgive
him
for
what
he
done
to
leslie
there
that
poor
child
eating
her
heart
out
about
him
as
if
she
had
had
trouble
enough
and
him
ranting
round
toronto
i
no
doubt
enjoying
himself
same
as
ever
just
like
a
man
oh
miss
cornelia
how
did
you
find
out
lord
anne
dearie
i
got
eyes
have
i
and
i
known
leslie
since
she
was
a
baby
there
been
a
new
kind
of
heartbreak
in
her
eyes
all
the
fall
and
i
know
that
was
behind
it
somehow
i
never
forgive
myself
for
being
the
means
of
bringing
him
here
but
i
never
expected
he
be
like
he
was
i
thought
he
just
be
like
the
other
men
leslie
had
boarded
conceited
young
asses
every
one
of
them
that
she
never
had
any
use
for
one
of
them
did
try
to
flirt
with
her
once
and
she
froze
him
out
so
bad
i
feel
sure
he
never
got
himself
thawed
since
so
i
never
thought
of
any
danger
do
let
leslie
suspect
you
know
her
secret
said
anne
hurriedly
i
think
it
would
hurt
her
trust
me
anne
dearie
was
born
yesterday
oh
a
plague
on
all
the
men
one
of
them
ruined
leslie
life
to
begin
with
and
now
another
of
the
tribe
comes
and
makes
her
still
more
wretched
anne
this
world
is
an
awful
place
believe
me
there
something
in
the
world
amiss
will
be
unriddled
by
and
by
quoted
anne
dreamily
if
it
is
it
be
in
a
world
where
there
are
any
men
said
miss
cornelia
gloomily
what
have
the
men
been
doing
now
asked
gilbert
entering
mischief
mischief
what
else
did
they
ever
do
it
was
eve
ate
the
apple
miss
cornelia
was
a
tempted
her
retorted
miss
cornelia
triumphantly
leslie
after
her
first
anguish
was
over
found
it
possible
to
go
on
with
life
after
all
as
most
of
us
do
no
matter
what
our
particular
form
of
torment
has
been
it
is
even
possible
that
she
enjoyed
moments
of
it
when
she
was
one
of
the
gay
circle
in
the
little
house
of
dreams
but
if
anne
ever
hoped
that
she
was
forgetting
owen
ford
she
would
have
been
undeceived
by
the
furtive
hunger
in
leslie
eyes
whenever
his
name
was
mentioned
pitiful
to
that
hunger
anne
always
contrived
to
tell
captain
jim
or
gilbert
bits
of
news
from
letters
when
leslie
was
with
them
the
girl
flush
and
pallor
at
such
moments
spoke
all
too
eloquently
of
the
emotion
that
filled
her
being
but
she
never
spoke
of
him
to
anne
or
mentioned
that
night
on
the
one
day
her
old
dog
died
and
she
grieved
bitterly
over
him
he
been
my
friend
so
long
she
said
sorrowfully
to
anne
he
was
dick
old
dog
you
know
dick
had
him
for
a
year
or
so
before
we
were
married
he
left
him
with
me
when
he
sailed
on
the
four
sisters
carlo
got
very
fond
of
me
and
his
helped
me
through
that
first
dreadful
year
after
mother
died
when
i
was
alone
when
i
heard
that
dick
was
coming
back
i
was
afraid
carlo
would
be
so
much
mine
but
he
never
seemed
to
care
for
dick
though
he
had
been
so
fond
of
him
once
he
would
snap
and
growl
at
him
as
if
he
were
a
stranger
i
was
glad
it
was
nice
to
have
one
thing
whose
love
was
all
mine
that
old
dog
has
been
such
a
comfort
to
me
anne
he
got
so
feeble
in
the
fall
that
i
was
afraid
he
could
live
long
but
i
hoped
i
could
nurse
him
through
the
winter
he
seemed
pretty
well
this
morning
he
was
lying
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
then
all
at
once
he
got
up
and
crept
over
to
me
he
put
his
head
on
my
lap
and
gave
me
one
loving
look
out
of
his
big
soft
dog
eyes
and
then
he
just
shivered
and
died
i
shall
miss
him
so
let
me
give
you
another
dog
leslie
said
anne
i
getting
a
lovely
gordon
setter
for
a
christmas
present
for
gilbert
let
me
give
you
one
too
leslie
shook
her
head
not
just
now
thank
you
anne
i
do
feel
like
having
another
dog
yet
i
do
seem
to
have
any
affection
left
for
another
perhaps
in
time
i
let
you
give
me
one
i
really
need
one
as
a
kind
of
protection
but
there
was
something
almost
human
about
carlo
it
would
be
decent
to
fill
his
place
too
hurriedly
dear
old
fellow
anne
went
to
avonlea
a
week
before
christmas
and
stayed
until
after
the
holidays
gilbert
came
up
for
her
and
there
was
a
glad
new
year
celebration
at
green
gables
when
barrys
and
blythes
and
wrights
assembled
to
devour
a
dinner
which
had
cost
rachel
and
marilla
much
careful
thought
and
preparation
when
they
went
back
to
four
winds
the
little
house
was
almost
drifted
over
for
the
third
storm
of
a
winter
that
was
to
prove
phenomenally
stormy
had
whirled
up
the
harbor
and
heaped
huge
snow
mountains
about
everything
it
encountered
but
captain
jim
had
shovelled
out
doors
and
paths
and
miss
cornelia
had
come
down
and
kindled
the
it
good
to
see
you
back
anne
dearie
but
did
you
ever
see
such
drifts
you
ca
see
the
moore
place
at
all
unless
you
go
upstairs
leslie
be
so
glad
you
back
she
almost
buried
alive
over
there
fortunately
dick
can
shovel
snow
and
thinks
it
great
fun
susan
sent
me
word
to
tell
you
she
would
be
on
hand
tomorrow
where
are
you
off
to
now
captain
i
reckon
i
plough
up
to
the
glen
and
sit
a
bit
with
old
martin
strong
he
not
far
from
his
end
and
he
lonesome
he
has
many
friends
been
too
busy
all
his
life
to
make
any
he
made
heaps
of
money
though
well
he
thought
that
since
he
could
serve
god
and
mammon
better
stick
to
mammon
said
miss
cornelia
crisply
so
he
complain
if
he
does
find
mammon
very
good
company
now
captain
jim
went
out
but
remembered
something
in
the
yard
and
turned
back
for
a
moment
i
a
letter
from
ford
mistress
blythe
and
he
says
the
is
accepted
and
is
going
to
be
published
next
fall
i
felt
fair
uplifted
when
i
got
the
news
to
think
that
i
to
see
it
in
print
at
last
that
man
is
clean
crazy
on
the
subject
of
his
said
miss
cornelia
compassionately
for
my
part
i
think
there
far
too
many
books
in
the
world
now
chapter
gilbert
and
anne
disagree
gilbert
laid
down
the
ponderous
medical
tome
over
which
he
had
been
poring
until
the
increasing
dusk
of
the
march
evening
made
him
desist
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
gazed
meditatively
out
of
the
window
it
was
early
spring
probably
the
ugliest
time
of
the
year
not
even
the
sunset
could
redeem
the
dead
sodden
landscape
and
rotten
black
harbor
ice
upon
which
he
looked
no
sign
of
life
was
visible
save
a
big
black
crow
winging
his
solitary
way
across
a
leaden
field
gilbert
speculated
idly
concerning
that
crow
was
he
a
family
crow
with
a
black
but
comely
crow
wife
awaiting
him
in
the
woods
beyond
the
glen
or
was
he
a
glossy
young
buck
of
a
crow
on
courting
thoughts
intent
or
was
he
a
cynical
bachelor
crow
believing
that
he
travels
the
fastest
who
travels
alone
whatever
he
was
he
soon
disappeared
in
congenial
gloom
and
gilbert
turned
to
the
cheerier
view
indoors
the
firelight
flickered
from
point
to
point
gleaming
on
the
white
and
green
coats
of
gog
and
magog
on
the
sleek
brown
head
of
the
beautiful
setter
basking
on
the
rug
on
the
picture
frames
on
the
walls
on
the
vaseful
of
daffodils
from
the
window
garden
on
anne
herself
sitting
by
her
little
table
with
her
sewing
beside
her
and
her
hands
clasped
over
her
knee
while
she
traced
out
pictures
in
the
fire
castles
in
spain
whose
airy
turrets
pierced
moonlit
cloud
and
sunset
sailing
from
the
haven
of
good
hopes
straight
to
four
winds
harbor
with
precious
burthen
for
anne
was
again
a
dreamer
of
dreams
albeit
a
grim
shape
of
fear
went
with
her
night
and
day
to
shadow
and
darken
her
visions
gilbert
was
accustomed
to
refer
to
himself
as
an
old
married
man
but
he
still
looked
upon
anne
with
the
incredulous
eyes
of
a
lover
he
could
wholly
believe
yet
that
she
was
really
his
it
might
be
only
a
dream
after
all
part
and
parcel
of
this
magic
house
of
dreams
his
soul
still
went
on
before
her
lest
the
charm
be
shattered
and
the
dream
dispelled
anne
he
said
slowly
lend
me
your
ears
i
want
to
talk
with
you
about
something
anne
looked
across
at
him
through
the
gloom
what
is
it
she
asked
gaily
you
look
fearfully
solemn
gilbert
i
really
have
done
anything
naughty
today
ask
susan
it
not
of
you
or
ourselves
i
want
to
talk
it
about
dick
moore
dick
moore
echoed
anne
sitting
up
alertly
why
what
in
the
world
have
you
to
say
about
dick
moore
i
been
thinking
a
great
deal
about
him
lately
do
you
remember
that
time
last
summer
i
treated
him
for
those
carbuncles
on
his
neck
yes
yes
i
took
the
opportunity
to
examine
the
scars
on
his
head
thoroughly
i
always
thought
dick
was
a
very
interesting
case
from
a
medical
point
of
view
lately
i
been
studying
the
history
of
trephining
and
the
cases
where
it
has
been
employed
anne
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
if
dick
moore
were
taken
to
a
good
hospital
and
the
operation
of
trephining
performed
on
several
places
in
his
skull
his
memory
and
faculties
might
be
restored
gilbert
anne
voice
was
full
of
protest
surely
you
do
mean
it
i
do
indeed
and
i
have
decided
that
it
is
my
duty
to
broach
the
subject
to
leslie
gilbert
blythe
you
shall
not
do
any
such
thing
cried
anne
vehemently
oh
gilbert
you
wo
you
wo
you
could
be
so
cruel
promise
me
you
wo
why
i
did
suppose
you
would
take
it
like
this
be
reasonable
i
wo
be
reasonable
i
ca
be
reasonable
i
am
reasonable
it
is
you
who
are
unreasonable
gilbert
have
you
ever
once
thought
what
it
would
mean
for
leslie
if
dick
moore
were
to
be
restored
to
his
right
senses
just
stop
and
think
she
unhappy
enough
now
but
life
as
dick
nurse
and
attendant
is
a
thousand
times
easier
for
her
than
life
as
dick
wife
i
know
i
know
it
unthinkable
do
you
meddle
with
the
matter
leave
well
enough
alone
i
have
thought
over
that
aspect
of
the
case
thoroughly
anne
but
i
believe
that
a
doctor
is
bound
to
set
the
sanctity
of
a
patient
mind
and
body
above
all
other
considerations
no
matter
what
the
consequences
may
be
i
believe
it
his
duty
to
endeavor
to
restore
health
and
sanity
if
there
is
any
hope
whatever
of
it
but
dick
is
your
patient
in
that
respect
cried
anne
taking
another
tack
if
leslie
had
asked
you
if
anything
could
be
done
for
him
then
it
might
be
your
duty
to
tell
her
what
you
really
thought
but
you
no
right
to
meddle
i
do
call
it
meddling
uncle
dave
told
leslie
twelve
years
ago
that
nothing
could
be
done
for
dick
she
believes
that
of
course
and
why
did
uncle
dave
tell
her
that
if
it
was
true
cried
anne
triumphantly
does
he
know
as
much
about
it
as
you
i
think
not
though
it
may
sound
conceited
and
presumptuous
to
say
it
and
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
he
is
rather
prejudiced
against
what
he
calls
notions
of
cutting
and
carving
he
even
opposed
to
operating
for
appendicitis
he
right
exclaimed
anne
with
a
complete
change
of
front
believe
myself
that
you
modern
doctors
are
entirely
too
fond
of
making
experiments
with
human
flesh
and
blood
rhoda
allonby
would
not
be
a
living
woman
today
if
i
had
been
afraid
of
making
a
certain
experiment
argued
gilbert
i
took
the
risk
and
saved
her
life
i
sick
and
tired
of
hearing
about
rhoda
allonby
cried
anne
most
unjustly
for
gilbert
had
never
mentioned
allonby
name
since
the
day
he
had
told
anne
of
his
success
in
regard
to
her
and
he
could
not
be
blamed
for
other
people
discussion
of
it
gilbert
felt
rather
hurt
i
had
not
expected
you
to
look
at
the
matter
as
you
do
anne
he
said
a
little
stiffly
getting
up
and
moving
towards
the
office
door
it
was
their
first
approach
to
a
quarrel
but
anne
flew
after
him
and
dragged
him
back
now
gilbert
you
are
not
off
mad
sit
down
here
and
apologise
i
should
have
said
that
but
oh
if
you
knew
anne
checked
herself
just
in
time
she
had
been
on
the
very
verge
of
betraying
leslie
secret
knew
what
a
woman
feels
about
it
she
concluded
lamely
i
think
i
do
know
i
looked
at
the
matter
from
every
point
of
view
and
i
been
driven
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
leslie
that
i
believe
it
is
possible
that
dick
can
be
restored
to
himself
there
my
responsibility
ends
it
will
be
for
her
to
decide
what
she
will
do
i
do
think
you
any
right
to
put
such
a
responsibility
on
her
she
has
enough
to
bear
she
is
poor
how
could
she
afford
such
an
operation
that
is
for
her
to
decide
persisted
gilbert
stubbornly
you
say
you
think
that
dick
can
be
cured
but
are
you
sure
of
it
certainly
not
nobody
could
be
sure
of
such
a
thing
there
may
have
been
lesions
of
the
brain
itself
the
effect
of
which
can
never
be
removed
but
if
as
i
believe
his
loss
of
memory
and
other
faculties
is
due
merely
to
the
pressure
on
the
brain
centers
of
certain
depressed
areas
of
bone
then
he
can
be
cured
but
it
only
a
possibility
insisted
anne
now
suppose
you
tell
leslie
and
she
decides
to
have
the
operation
it
will
cost
a
great
deal
she
will
have
to
borrow
the
money
or
sell
her
little
property
and
suppose
the
operation
is
a
failure
and
dick
remains
the
same
how
will
she
be
able
to
pay
back
the
money
she
borrows
or
make
a
living
for
herself
and
that
big
helpless
creature
if
she
sells
the
farm
oh
i
know
i
know
but
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
her
i
ca
get
away
from
that
conviction
oh
i
know
the
blythe
stubbornness
groaned
anne
but
do
do
this
solely
on
your
own
responsibility
consult
doctor
dave
i
have
done
so
said
gilbert
reluctantly
and
what
did
he
say
in
brief
as
you
say
leave
well
enough
alone
apart
from
his
prejudice
against
surgery
i
afraid
he
looks
at
the
case
from
your
point
of
view
do
do
it
for
leslie
sake
there
now
cried
anne
triumphantly
i
do
think
gilbert
that
you
ought
to
abide
by
the
judgment
of
a
man
nearly
eighty
who
has
seen
a
great
deal
and
saved
scores
of
lives
himself
surely
his
opinion
ought
to
weigh
more
than
a
mere
boy
thank
you
do
laugh
it
too
serious
that
just
my
point
it
is
serious
here
is
a
man
who
is
a
helpless
burden
he
may
be
restored
to
reason
and
usefulness
he
was
so
very
useful
before
interjected
anne
witheringly
he
may
be
given
a
chance
to
make
good
and
redeem
the
past
his
wife
does
know
this
i
do
it
is
therefore
my
duty
to
tell
her
that
there
is
such
a
possibility
that
boiled
down
is
my
decision
do
say
yet
gilbert
consult
somebody
else
ask
captain
jim
what
he
thinks
about
it
very
well
but
i
not
promise
to
abide
by
his
opinion
anne
this
is
something
a
man
must
decide
for
himself
my
conscience
would
never
be
easy
if
i
kept
silent
on
the
subject
oh
your
conscience
moaned
anne
i
suppose
that
uncle
dave
has
a
conscience
too
has
he
yes
but
i
am
not
the
keeper
of
his
conscience
come
anne
if
this
affair
did
not
concern
leslie
if
it
were
a
purely
abstract
case
you
would
agree
with
me
you
know
you
would
i
would
vowed
anne
trying
to
believe
it
herself
oh
you
can
argue
all
night
gilbert
but
you
wo
convince
me
just
you
ask
miss
cornelia
what
she
thinks
of
it
you
driven
to
the
last
ditch
anne
when
you
bring
up
miss
cornelia
as
a
reinforcement
she
will
say
like
a
man
and
rage
furiously
no
matter
this
is
no
affair
for
miss
cornelia
to
settle
leslie
alone
must
decide
it
you
know
very
well
how
she
will
decide
it
said
anne
almost
in
tears
she
has
ideals
of
duty
too
i
do
see
how
you
can
take
such
a
responsibility
on
your
shoulders
could
right
is
right
to
follow
right
were
wisdom
in
the
scorn
of
consequence
quoted
gilbert
oh
you
think
a
couplet
of
poetry
a
convincing
argument
scoffed
anne
that
is
so
like
a
man
and
then
she
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
it
sounded
so
like
an
echo
of
miss
cornelia
well
if
you
wo
accept
tennyson
as
an
authority
perhaps
you
will
believe
the
words
of
a
greater
than
he
said
gilbert
seriously
shall
know
the
truth
and
the
truth
shall
make
you
free
i
believe
that
anne
with
all
my
heart
it
the
greatest
and
grandest
verse
in
the
bible
or
in
any
literature
and
the
truest
if
there
are
comparative
degrees
of
trueness
and
it
the
first
duty
of
a
man
to
tell
the
truth
as
he
sees
it
and
believes
it
in
this
case
the
truth
wo
make
poor
leslie
free
sighed
anne
it
will
probably
end
in
still
more
bitter
bondage
for
her
oh
gilbert
i
ca
think
you
are
right
chapter
leslie
decides
a
sudden
outbreak
of
a
virulent
type
of
influenza
at
the
glen
and
down
at
the
fishing
village
kept
gilbert
so
busy
for
the
next
fortnight
that
he
had
no
time
to
pay
the
promised
visit
to
captain
jim
anne
hoped
against
hope
that
he
had
abandoned
the
idea
about
dick
moore
and
resolving
to
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
she
said
no
more
about
the
subject
but
she
thought
of
it
incessantly
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
right
for
me
to
tell
him
that
leslie
cares
for
owen
she
thought
he
would
never
let
her
suspect
that
he
knew
so
her
pride
would
not
suffer
and
it
might
convince
him
that
he
should
let
dick
moore
alone
shall
i
shall
i
no
after
all
i
can
not
a
promise
is
sacred
and
i
no
right
to
betray
leslie
secret
but
oh
i
never
felt
so
worried
over
anything
in
my
life
as
i
do
over
this
it
spoiling
the
spring
it
spoiling
everything
one
evening
gilbert
abruptly
proposed
that
they
go
down
and
see
captain
jim
with
a
sinking
heart
anne
agreed
and
they
set
forth
two
weeks
of
kind
sunshine
had
wrought
a
miracle
in
the
bleak
landscape
over
which
gilbert
crow
had
flown
the
hills
and
fields
were
dry
and
brown
and
warm
ready
to
break
into
bud
and
blossom
the
harbor
was
again
the
long
harbor
road
was
like
a
gleaming
red
ribbon
down
on
the
dunes
a
crowd
of
boys
who
were
out
smelt
fishing
were
burning
the
thick
dry
sandhill
grass
of
the
preceding
summer
the
flames
swept
over
the
dunes
rosily
flinging
their
cardinal
banners
against
the
dark
gulf
beyond
and
illuminating
the
channel
and
the
fishing
village
it
was
a
picturesque
scene
which
would
at
other
times
have
delighted
anne
eyes
but
she
was
not
enjoying
this
walk
neither
was
gilbert
their
usual
and
josephian
community
of
taste
and
viewpoint
were
sadly
lacking
disapproval
of
the
whole
project
showed
itself
in
the
haughty
uplift
of
her
head
and
the
studied
politeness
of
her
remarks
gilbert
mouth
was
set
in
all
the
blythe
obstinacy
but
his
eyes
were
troubled
he
meant
to
do
what
he
believed
to
be
his
duty
but
to
be
at
outs
with
anne
was
a
high
price
to
pay
altogether
both
were
glad
when
they
reached
the
light
and
remorseful
that
they
should
be
glad
captain
jim
put
away
the
fishing
net
upon
which
he
was
working
and
welcomed
them
joyfully
in
the
searching
light
of
the
spring
evening
he
looked
older
than
anne
had
ever
seen
him
his
hair
had
grown
much
grayer
and
the
strong
old
hand
shook
a
little
but
his
blue
eyes
were
clear
and
steady
and
the
staunch
soul
looked
out
through
them
gallant
and
unafraid
captain
jim
listened
in
amazed
silence
while
gilbert
said
what
he
had
come
to
say
anne
who
knew
how
the
old
man
worshipped
leslie
felt
quite
sure
that
he
would
side
with
her
although
she
had
not
much
hope
that
this
would
influence
gilbert
she
was
therefore
surprised
beyond
measure
when
captain
jim
slowly
and
sorrowfully
but
unhesitatingly
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
leslie
should
be
told
oh
captain
jim
i
did
think
you
say
that
she
exclaimed
reproachfully
i
thought
you
would
want
to
make
more
trouble
for
her
captain
jim
shook
his
head
i
do
want
to
i
know
how
you
feel
about
it
mistress
blythe
just
as
i
feel
meself
but
it
ai
our
feelings
we
have
to
steer
by
through
life
no
no
we
make
shipwreck
mighty
often
if
we
did
that
there
only
the
one
safe
compass
and
we
got
to
set
our
course
by
that
what
it
right
to
do
i
agree
with
the
doctor
if
there
a
chance
for
dick
leslie
should
be
told
of
it
there
no
two
sides
to
that
in
my
opinion
well
said
anne
giving
up
in
despair
wait
until
miss
cornelia
gets
after
you
two
men
cornelia
rake
us
fore
and
aft
no
doubt
assented
captain
jim
you
women
are
lovely
critters
mistress
blythe
but
you
just
a
mite
illogical
you
a
highly
eddicated
lady
and
cornelia
is
but
you
like
as
two
peas
when
it
comes
to
that
i
dunno
you
any
the
worse
for
it
logic
is
a
sort
of
hard
merciless
thing
i
reckon
now
i
brew
a
cup
of
tea
and
we
drink
it
and
talk
of
pleasant
things
jest
to
calm
our
minds
a
bit
at
least
captain
jim
tea
and
conversation
calmed
anne
mind
to
such
an
extent
that
she
did
not
make
gilbert
suffer
so
acutely
on
the
way
home
as
she
had
deliberately
intended
to
do
she
did
not
refer
to
the
burning
question
at
all
but
she
chatted
amiably
of
other
matters
and
gilbert
understood
that
he
was
forgiven
under
protest
captain
jim
seems
very
frail
and
bent
this
spring
the
winter
has
aged
him
said
anne
sadly
i
am
afraid
that
he
will
soon
be
going
to
seek
lost
margaret
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
it
four
winds
wo
be
the
same
place
when
captain
jim
out
to
sea
agreed
gilbert
the
following
evening
he
went
to
the
house
up
the
brook
anne
wandered
dismally
around
until
his
return
well
what
did
leslie
say
she
demanded
when
he
came
in
very
little
i
think
she
felt
rather
dazed
and
is
she
going
to
have
the
operation
she
is
going
to
think
it
over
and
decide
very
soon
gilbert
flung
himself
wearily
into
the
easy
chair
before
the
fire
he
looked
tired
it
had
not
been
an
easy
thing
for
him
to
tell
leslie
and
the
terror
that
had
sprung
into
her
eyes
when
the
meaning
of
what
he
told
her
came
home
to
her
was
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
remember
now
when
the
die
was
cast
he
was
beset
with
doubts
of
his
own
wisdom
anne
looked
at
him
remorsefully
then
she
slipped
down
on
the
rug
beside
him
and
laid
her
glossy
red
head
on
his
arm
gilbert
i
been
rather
hateful
over
this
i
wo
be
any
more
please
just
call
me
and
forgive
me
by
which
gilbert
understood
that
no
matter
what
came
of
it
there
would
be
no
but
he
was
not
wholly
comforted
duty
in
the
abstract
is
one
thing
duty
in
the
concrete
is
quite
another
especially
when
the
doer
is
confronted
by
a
woman
stricken
eyes
some
instinct
made
anne
keep
away
from
leslie
for
the
next
three
days
on
the
third
evening
leslie
came
down
to
the
little
house
and
told
gilbert
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
she
would
take
dick
to
montreal
and
have
the
operation
she
was
very
pale
and
seemed
to
have
wrapped
herself
in
her
old
mantle
of
aloofness
but
her
eyes
had
lost
the
look
which
had
haunted
gilbert
they
were
cold
and
bright
and
she
proceeded
to
discuss
details
with
him
in
a
crisp
way
there
were
plans
to
be
made
and
many
things
to
be
thought
over
when
leslie
had
got
the
information
she
wanted
she
went
home
anne
wanted
to
walk
part
of
the
way
with
her
better
not
said
leslie
curtly
today
rain
has
made
the
ground
damp
have
i
lost
my
friend
said
anne
with
a
sigh
if
the
operation
is
successful
and
dick
moore
finds
himself
again
leslie
will
retreat
into
some
remote
fastness
of
her
soul
where
none
of
us
can
ever
find
her
perhaps
she
will
leave
him
said
gilbert
leslie
would
never
do
that
gilbert
her
sense
of
duty
is
very
strong
she
told
me
once
that
her
grandmother
west
always
impressed
upon
her
the
fact
that
when
she
assumed
any
responsibility
she
must
never
shirk
it
no
matter
what
the
consequences
might
be
that
is
one
of
her
cardinal
rules
i
suppose
it
very
do
be
bitter
you
know
you
do
think
it
you
know
you
have
the
very
same
idea
of
sacredness
of
assumed
responsibilities
yourself
and
you
are
right
shirking
responsibilities
is
the
curse
of
our
modern
life
the
secret
of
all
the
unrest
and
discontent
that
is
seething
in
the
world
thus
saith
the
preacher
mocked
anne
but
under
the
mockery
she
felt
that
he
was
right
and
she
was
very
sick
at
heart
for
leslie
a
week
later
miss
cornelia
descended
like
an
avalanche
upon
the
little
house
gilbert
was
away
and
anne
was
compelled
to
bear
the
shock
of
the
impact
alone
miss
cornelia
hardly
waited
to
get
her
hat
off
before
she
began
anne
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
it
true
what
i
heard
that
blythe
has
told
leslie
dick
can
be
cured
and
that
she
is
going
to
take
him
to
montreal
to
have
him
operated
on
yes
it
is
quite
true
miss
cornelia
said
anne
bravely
well
it
inhuman
cruelty
that
what
it
is
said
miss
cornelia
violently
agitated
i
did
think
blythe
was
a
decent
man
i
did
think
he
could
have
been
guilty
of
this
blythe
thought
it
was
his
duty
to
tell
leslie
that
there
was
a
chance
for
dick
said
anne
with
spirit
and
she
added
loyalty
to
gilbert
getting
the
better
of
her
i
agree
with
him
oh
no
you
do
dearie
said
miss
cornelia
no
person
with
any
bowels
of
compassion
could
captain
jim
does
do
quote
that
old
ninny
to
me
cried
miss
cornelia
and
i
care
who
agrees
with
him
think
think
what
it
means
to
that
poor
hunted
harried
girl
we
do
think
of
it
but
gilbert
believes
that
a
doctor
should
put
the
welfare
of
a
patient
mind
and
body
before
all
other
considerations
that
just
like
a
man
but
i
expected
better
things
of
you
anne
said
miss
cornelia
more
in
sorrow
than
in
wrath
then
she
proceeded
to
bombard
anne
with
precisely
the
same
arguments
with
which
the
latter
had
attacked
gilbert
and
anne
valiantly
defended
her
husband
with
the
weapons
he
had
used
for
his
own
protection
long
was
the
fray
but
miss
cornelia
made
an
end
at
last
it
an
iniquitous
shame
she
declared
almost
in
tears
just
what
it
is
an
iniquitous
shame
poor
poor
leslie
do
you
think
dick
should
be
considered
a
little
too
pleaded
anne
dick
dick
moore
he
happy
enough
he
a
better
behaved
and
more
reputable
member
of
society
now
than
he
ever
was
before
why
he
was
a
drunkard
and
perhaps
worse
are
you
going
to
set
him
loose
again
to
roar
and
to
devour
he
may
reform
said
poor
anne
beset
by
foe
without
and
traitor
within
reform
your
grandmother
retorted
miss
cornelia
dick
moore
got
the
injuries
that
left
him
as
he
is
in
a
drunken
brawl
he
deserves
his
fate
it
was
sent
on
him
for
a
punishment
i
do
believe
the
doctor
has
any
business
to
tamper
with
the
visitations
of
god
nobody
knows
how
dick
was
hurt
miss
cornelia
it
may
not
have
been
in
a
drunken
brawl
at
all
he
may
have
been
waylaid
and
robbed
pigs
may
whistle
but
they
poor
mouths
for
it
said
miss
cornelia
well
the
gist
of
what
you
tell
me
is
that
the
thing
is
settled
and
there
no
use
in
talking
if
that
so
i
hold
my
tongue
i
propose
to
wear
my
teeth
out
gnawing
files
when
a
thing
has
to
be
i
give
in
to
it
but
i
like
to
make
mighty
sure
first
that
it
has
to
be
now
i
devote
my
energies
to
comforting
and
sustaining
leslie
and
after
all
added
miss
cornelia
brightening
up
hopefully
perhaps
nothing
can
be
done
for
dick
chapter
the
truth
makes
free
leslie
having
once
made
up
her
mind
what
to
do
proceeded
to
do
it
with
characteristic
resolution
and
speed
must
be
finished
with
first
whatever
issues
of
life
and
death
might
await
beyond
the
gray
house
up
the
brook
was
put
into
flawless
order
and
cleanliness
with
miss
cornelia
ready
assistance
miss
cornelia
having
said
her
say
to
anne
and
later
on
to
gilbert
and
captain
jim
sparing
neither
of
them
let
it
be
assured
never
spoke
of
the
matter
to
leslie
she
accepted
the
fact
of
dick
operation
referred
to
it
when
necessary
in
a
way
and
ignored
it
when
it
was
not
leslie
never
attempted
to
discuss
it
she
was
very
cold
and
quiet
during
these
beautiful
spring
days
she
seldom
visited
anne
and
though
she
was
invariably
courteous
and
friendly
that
very
courtesy
was
as
an
icy
barrier
between
her
and
the
people
of
the
little
house
the
old
jokes
and
laughter
and
chumminess
of
common
things
could
not
reach
her
over
it
anne
refused
to
feel
hurt
she
knew
that
leslie
was
in
the
grip
of
a
hideous
dread
a
dread
that
wrapped
her
away
from
all
little
glimpses
of
happiness
and
hours
of
pleasure
when
one
great
passion
seizes
possession
of
the
soul
all
other
feelings
are
crowded
aside
never
in
all
her
life
had
leslie
moore
shuddered
away
from
the
future
with
more
intolerable
terror
but
she
went
forward
as
unswervingly
in
the
path
she
had
elected
as
the
martyrs
of
old
walked
their
chosen
way
knowing
the
end
of
it
to
be
the
fiery
agony
of
the
stake
the
financial
question
was
settled
with
greater
ease
than
anne
had
feared
leslie
borrowed
the
necessary
money
from
captain
jim
and
at
her
insistence
he
took
a
mortgage
on
the
little
farm
so
that
is
one
thing
off
the
poor
girl
mind
miss
cornelia
told
anne
and
off
mine
too
now
if
dick
gets
well
enough
to
work
again
he
be
able
to
earn
enough
to
pay
the
interest
on
it
and
if
he
does
i
know
captain
jim
manage
someway
that
leslie
wo
have
to
he
said
as
much
to
me
getting
old
cornelia
he
said
no
chick
or
child
of
my
own
leslie
wo
take
a
gift
from
a
living
man
but
mebbe
she
will
from
a
dead
one
so
it
will
be
all
right
as
far
as
that
goes
i
wish
everything
else
might
be
settled
as
satisfactorily
as
for
that
wretch
of
a
dick
he
been
awful
these
last
few
days
the
devil
was
in
him
believe
me
leslie
and
i
could
get
on
with
our
work
for
the
tricks
he
play
he
chased
all
her
ducks
one
day
around
the
yard
till
most
of
them
died
and
not
one
thing
would
he
do
for
us
sometimes
you
know
he
make
himself
quite
handy
bringing
in
pails
of
water
and
wood
but
this
week
if
we
sent
him
to
the
well
he
try
to
climb
down
into
it
i
thought
once
you
only
shoot
down
there
everything
would
be
nicely
settled
oh
miss
cornelia
now
you
need
miss
cornelia
me
anne
dearie
anybody
would
have
thought
the
same
if
the
montreal
doctors
can
make
a
rational
creature
out
of
dick
moore
they
wonders
leslie
took
dick
to
montreal
early
in
may
gilbert
went
with
her
to
help
her
and
make
the
necessary
arrangements
for
her
he
came
home
with
the
report
that
the
montreal
surgeon
whom
they
had
consulted
agreed
with
him
that
there
was
a
good
chance
of
dick
restoration
very
comforting
was
miss
cornelia
sarcastic
comment
anne
only
sighed
leslie
had
been
very
distant
at
their
parting
but
she
had
promised
to
write
ten
days
after
gilbert
return
the
letter
came
leslie
wrote
that
the
operation
had
been
successfully
performed
and
that
dick
was
making
a
good
recovery
what
does
she
mean
by
asked
anne
does
she
mean
that
dick
memory
is
really
restored
not
likely
since
she
says
nothing
of
it
said
gilbert
she
uses
the
word
from
the
surgeon
point
of
view
the
operation
has
been
performed
and
followed
by
normal
results
but
it
is
too
soon
to
know
whether
dick
faculties
will
be
eventually
restored
wholly
or
in
part
his
memory
would
not
be
likely
to
return
to
him
all
at
once
the
process
will
be
gradual
if
it
occurs
at
all
is
that
all
she
says
yes
there
her
letter
it
very
short
poor
girl
she
must
be
under
a
terrible
strain
gilbert
blythe
there
are
heaps
of
things
i
long
to
say
to
you
only
it
would
be
mean
miss
cornelia
says
them
for
you
said
gilbert
with
a
rueful
smile
she
combs
me
down
every
time
i
encounter
her
she
makes
it
plain
to
me
that
she
regards
me
as
little
better
than
a
murderer
and
that
she
thinks
it
a
great
pity
that
dave
ever
let
me
step
into
his
shoes
she
even
told
me
that
the
methodist
doctor
over
the
harbor
was
to
be
preferred
before
me
with
miss
cornelia
the
force
of
condemnation
can
no
further
go
if
cornelia
bryant
was
sick
it
would
not
be
doctor
dave
or
the
methodist
doctor
she
would
send
for
sniffed
susan
she
would
have
you
out
of
your
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
night
doctor
dear
if
she
took
a
spell
of
misery
that
she
would
and
then
she
would
likely
say
your
bill
was
past
all
reason
but
do
not
mind
her
doctor
dear
it
takes
all
kinds
of
people
to
make
a
world
no
further
word
came
from
leslie
for
some
time
the
may
days
crept
away
in
a
sweet
succession
and
the
shores
of
four
winds
harbor
greened
and
bloomed
and
purpled
one
day
in
late
may
gilbert
came
home
to
be
met
by
susan
in
the
stable
yard
i
am
afraid
something
has
upset
mrs
doctor
doctor
dear
she
said
mysteriously
she
got
a
letter
this
afternoon
and
since
then
she
has
just
been
walking
round
the
garden
and
talking
to
herself
you
know
it
is
not
good
for
her
to
be
on
her
feet
so
much
doctor
dear
she
did
not
see
fit
to
tell
me
what
her
news
was
and
i
am
no
pry
doctor
dear
and
never
was
but
it
is
plain
something
has
upset
her
and
it
is
not
good
for
her
to
be
upset
gilbert
hurried
rather
anxiously
to
the
garden
had
anything
happened
at
green
gables
but
anne
sitting
on
the
rustic
seat
by
the
brook
did
not
look
troubled
though
she
was
certainly
much
excited
her
eyes
were
their
grayest
and
scarlet
spots
burned
on
her
cheeks
what
has
happened
anne
anne
gave
a
queer
little
laugh
i
think
you
hardly
believe
it
when
i
tell
you
gilbert
believe
it
yet
as
susan
said
the
other
day
feel
like
a
fly
coming
to
live
in
the
sun
it
all
so
incredible
i
read
the
letter
a
score
of
times
and
every
time
it
just
the
same
i
believe
my
own
eyes
oh
gilbert
you
were
right
so
right
i
can
see
that
clearly
enough
now
and
i
so
ashamed
of
myself
and
will
you
ever
really
forgive
me
anne
i
shake
you
if
you
do
grow
coherent
redmond
would
be
ashamed
of
you
what
has
happened
you
wo
believe
it
you
wo
believe
it
i
going
to
phone
for
uncle
dave
said
gilbert
pretending
to
start
for
the
house
sit
down
gilbert
i
try
to
tell
you
i
had
a
letter
and
oh
gilbert
it
all
so
amazing
so
incredibly
amazing
we
never
thought
not
one
of
us
ever
dreamed
i
suppose
said
gilbert
sitting
down
with
a
resigned
air
the
only
thing
to
do
in
a
case
of
this
kind
is
to
have
patience
and
go
at
the
matter
categorically
whom
is
your
letter
from
leslie
and
oh
gilbert
leslie
whew
what
has
she
to
say
what
the
news
about
dick
anne
lifted
the
letter
and
held
it
out
calmly
dramatic
in
a
moment
there
is
no
dick
the
man
we
have
thought
dick
moore
whom
everybody
in
four
winds
has
believed
for
twelve
years
to
be
dick
moore
is
his
cousin
george
moore
of
nova
scotia
who
it
seems
always
resembled
him
very
strikingly
dick
moore
died
of
yellow
fever
thirteen
years
ago
in
cuba
chapter
miss
cornelia
discusses
the
affair
and
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
anne
dearie
that
dick
moore
has
turned
out
not
to
be
dick
moore
at
all
but
somebody
else
is
that
what
you
phoned
up
to
me
today
yes
miss
cornelia
it
is
very
amazing
is
it
it
it
just
like
a
man
said
miss
cornelia
helplessly
she
took
off
her
hat
with
trembling
fingers
for
once
in
her
life
miss
cornelia
was
undeniably
staggered
i
ca
seem
to
sense
it
anne
she
said
i
heard
you
say
it
and
i
believe
you
but
i
ca
take
it
in
dick
moore
is
dead
has
been
dead
all
these
years
and
leslie
is
free
yes
the
truth
has
made
her
free
gilbert
was
right
when
he
said
that
verse
was
the
grandest
in
the
bible
tell
me
everything
anne
dearie
since
i
got
your
phone
i
been
in
a
regular
muddle
believe
me
cornelia
bryant
was
never
so
kerflummuxed
before
there
is
a
very
great
deal
to
tell
leslie
letter
was
short
she
did
go
into
particulars
this
man
george
moore
has
recovered
his
memory
and
knows
who
he
is
he
says
dick
took
yellow
fever
in
cuba
and
the
four
sisters
had
to
sail
without
him
george
stayed
behind
to
nurse
him
but
he
died
very
shortly
afterwards
george
did
not
write
leslie
because
he
intended
to
come
right
home
and
tell
her
himself
and
why
did
he
i
suppose
his
accident
must
have
intervened
gilbert
says
it
is
quite
likely
that
george
moore
remembers
nothing
of
his
accident
or
what
led
to
it
and
may
never
remember
it
it
probably
happened
very
soon
after
dick
death
we
may
find
out
more
particulars
when
leslie
writes
again
does
she
say
what
she
is
going
to
do
when
is
she
coming
home
she
says
she
will
stay
with
george
moore
until
he
can
leave
the
hospital
she
has
written
to
his
people
in
nova
scotia
it
seems
that
george
only
near
relative
is
a
married
sister
much
older
than
himself
she
was
living
when
george
sailed
on
the
four
sisters
but
of
course
we
do
not
know
what
may
have
happened
since
did
you
ever
see
george
moore
miss
cornelia
i
did
it
is
all
coming
back
to
me
he
was
here
visiting
his
uncle
abner
eighteen
years
ago
when
he
and
dick
would
be
about
seventeen
they
were
double
cousins
you
see
their
fathers
were
brothers
and
their
mothers
were
twin
sisters
and
they
did
look
a
terrible
lot
alike
of
course
added
miss
cornelia
scornfully
it
was
one
of
those
freak
resemblances
you
read
of
in
novels
where
two
people
are
so
much
alike
that
they
can
fill
each
other
places
and
their
nearest
and
dearest
ca
tell
between
them
in
those
days
you
could
tell
easy
enough
which
was
george
and
which
was
dick
if
you
saw
them
together
and
near
at
hand
apart
or
some
distance
away
it
was
so
easy
they
played
lots
of
tricks
on
people
and
thought
it
great
fun
the
two
scamps
george
moore
was
a
little
taller
and
a
good
deal
fatter
than
dick
though
neither
of
them
was
what
you
would
call
fat
they
were
both
of
the
lean
kind
dick
had
higher
color
than
george
and
his
hair
was
a
shade
lighter
but
their
features
were
just
alike
and
they
both
had
that
queer
freak
of
eyes
one
blue
and
one
hazel
they
much
alike
in
any
other
way
though
george
was
a
real
nice
fellow
though
he
was
a
scalawag
for
mischief
and
some
said
he
had
a
liking
for
a
glass
even
then
but
everybody
liked
him
better
than
dick
he
spent
about
a
month
here
leslie
never
saw
him
she
was
only
about
eight
or
nine
then
and
i
remember
now
that
she
spent
that
whole
winter
over
harbor
with
her
grandmother
west
captain
jim
was
away
too
that
was
the
winter
he
was
wrecked
on
the
magdalens
i
do
suppose
either
he
or
leslie
had
ever
heard
about
the
nova
scotia
cousin
looking
so
much
like
dick
nobody
ever
thought
of
him
when
captain
jim
brought
dick
george
i
should
say
home
of
course
we
all
thought
dick
had
changed
considerable
he
got
so
lumpish
and
fat
but
we
put
that
down
to
what
had
happened
to
him
and
no
doubt
that
was
the
reason
for
as
i
said
george
was
fat
to
begin
with
either
and
there
was
no
other
way
we
could
have
guessed
for
the
man
senses
were
clean
gone
i
ca
see
that
it
is
any
wonder
we
were
all
deceived
but
it
a
staggering
thing
and
leslie
has
sacrificed
the
best
years
of
her
life
to
nursing
a
man
who
had
any
claim
on
her
oh
drat
the
men
no
matter
what
they
do
it
the
wrong
thing
and
no
matter
who
they
are
it
somebody
they
should
be
they
do
exasperate
me
gilbert
and
captain
jim
are
men
and
it
is
through
them
that
the
truth
has
been
discovered
at
last
said
anne
well
i
admit
that
conceded
miss
cornelia
reluctantly
i
sorry
i
raked
the
doctor
off
so
it
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
ever
felt
ashamed
of
anything
i
said
to
a
man
i
do
know
as
i
shall
tell
him
so
though
he
just
have
to
take
it
for
granted
well
anne
dearie
it
a
mercy
the
lord
does
answer
all
our
prayers
been
praying
hard
right
along
that
the
operation
would
cure
dick
of
course
i
did
put
it
just
quite
so
plain
but
that
was
what
was
in
the
back
of
my
mind
and
i
have
no
doubt
the
lord
knew
it
well
he
has
answered
the
spirit
of
your
prayer
you
really
wished
that
things
should
be
made
any
harder
for
leslie
i
afraid
that
in
my
secret
heart
i
been
hoping
the
operation
would
succeed
and
i
am
wholesomely
ashamed
of
it
how
does
leslie
seem
to
take
it
she
writes
like
one
dazed
i
think
that
like
ourselves
she
hardly
realises
it
yet
she
says
all
seems
like
a
strange
dream
to
me
anne
that
is
the
only
reference
she
makes
to
herself
poor
child
i
suppose
when
the
chains
are
struck
off
a
prisoner
feel
queer
and
lost
without
them
for
a
while
anne
dearie
here
a
thought
keeps
coming
into
my
mind
what
about
owen
ford
we
both
know
leslie
was
fond
of
him
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
he
was
fond
of
her
it
did
once
admitted
anne
feeling
that
she
might
say
so
much
well
i
had
any
reason
to
think
he
was
but
it
just
appeared
to
me
he
must
be
now
anne
dearie
the
lord
knows
i
not
a
and
i
scorn
all
such
doings
but
if
i
were
you
and
writing
to
that
ford
man
i
just
mention
what
has
happened
that
is
what
do
of
course
i
will
mention
it
when
i
write
him
said
anne
a
trifle
distantly
somehow
this
was
a
thing
she
could
not
discuss
with
miss
cornelia
and
yet
she
had
to
admit
that
the
same
thought
had
been
lurking
in
her
mind
ever
since
she
had
heard
of
leslie
freedom
but
she
would
not
desecrate
it
by
free
speech
of
course
there
is
no
great
rush
dearie
but
dick
moore
been
dead
for
thirteen
years
and
leslie
has
wasted
enough
of
her
life
for
him
we
just
see
what
comes
of
it
as
for
this
george
moore
who
gone
and
come
back
to
life
when
everyone
thought
he
was
dead
and
done
for
just
like
a
man
i
real
sorry
for
him
he
wo
seem
to
fit
in
anywhere
he
is
still
a
young
man
and
if
he
recovers
completely
as
seems
likely
he
will
be
able
to
make
a
place
for
himself
again
it
must
be
very
strange
for
him
poor
fellow
i
suppose
all
these
years
since
his
accident
will
not
exist
for
him
chapter
leslie
returns
a
fortnight
later
leslie
moore
came
home
alone
to
the
old
house
where
she
had
spent
so
many
bitter
years
in
the
june
twilight
she
went
over
the
fields
to
anne
and
appeared
with
suddenness
in
the
scented
garden
leslie
cried
anne
in
amazement
where
have
you
sprung
from
we
never
knew
you
were
coming
why
did
you
write
we
would
have
met
you
i
could
write
somehow
anne
it
seemed
so
futile
to
try
to
say
anything
with
pen
and
ink
and
i
wanted
to
get
back
quietly
and
unobserved
anne
put
her
arms
about
leslie
and
kissed
her
leslie
returned
the
kiss
warmly
she
looked
pale
and
tired
and
she
gave
a
little
sigh
as
she
dropped
down
on
the
grasses
beside
a
great
bed
of
daffodils
that
were
gleaming
through
the
pale
silvery
twilight
like
golden
stars
and
you
have
come
home
alone
leslie
yes
george
moore
sister
came
to
montreal
and
took
him
home
with
her
poor
fellow
he
was
sorry
to
part
with
me
though
i
was
a
stranger
to
him
when
his
memory
first
came
back
he
clung
to
me
in
those
first
hard
days
when
he
was
trying
to
realise
that
dick
death
was
not
the
thing
of
yesterday
that
it
seemed
to
him
it
was
all
very
hard
for
him
i
helped
him
all
i
could
when
his
sister
came
it
was
easier
for
him
because
it
seemed
to
him
only
the
other
day
that
he
had
seen
her
last
fortunately
she
had
not
changed
much
and
that
helped
him
too
it
is
all
so
strange
and
wonderful
leslie
i
think
we
none
of
us
realise
it
yet
i
can
not
when
i
went
into
the
house
over
there
an
hour
ago
i
felt
that
it
must
be
a
dream
that
dick
must
be
there
with
his
childish
smile
as
he
had
been
for
so
long
anne
i
seem
stunned
yet
i
not
glad
or
sorry
or
anything
i
feel
as
if
something
had
been
torn
suddenly
out
of
my
life
and
left
a
terrible
hole
i
feel
as
if
i
could
be
as
if
i
must
have
changed
into
somebody
else
and
could
get
used
to
it
it
gives
me
a
horrible
lonely
dazed
helpless
feeling
it
good
to
see
you
again
it
seems
as
if
you
were
a
sort
of
anchor
for
my
drifting
soul
oh
anne
i
dread
it
all
the
gossip
and
wonderment
and
questioning
when
i
think
of
that
i
wish
that
i
need
not
have
come
home
at
all
dave
was
at
the
station
when
i
came
off
the
train
he
brought
me
home
poor
old
man
he
feels
very
badly
because
he
told
me
years
ago
that
nothing
could
be
done
for
dick
honestly
thought
so
leslie
he
said
to
me
today
i
should
have
told
you
not
to
depend
on
my
opinion
i
should
have
told
you
to
go
to
a
specialist
if
i
had
you
would
have
been
saved
many
bitter
years
and
poor
george
moore
many
wasted
ones
i
blame
myself
very
much
leslie
i
told
him
not
to
do
that
he
had
done
what
he
thought
right
he
has
always
been
so
kind
to
me
i
could
bear
to
see
him
worrying
over
it
and
dick
george
i
mean
is
his
memory
fully
restored
practically
of
course
there
are
a
great
many
details
he
recall
yet
but
he
remembers
more
and
more
every
day
he
went
out
for
a
walk
on
the
evening
after
dick
was
buried
he
had
dick
money
and
watch
on
him
he
meant
to
bring
them
home
to
me
along
with
my
letter
he
admits
he
went
to
a
place
where
the
sailors
resorted
and
he
remembers
drinking
and
nothing
else
anne
i
shall
never
forget
the
moment
he
remembered
his
own
name
i
saw
him
looking
at
me
with
an
intelligent
but
puzzled
expression
i
said
you
know
me
dick
he
answered
never
saw
you
before
who
are
you
and
my
name
is
not
dick
i
am
george
moore
and
dick
died
of
yellow
fever
yesterday
where
am
i
what
has
happened
to
me
i
i
fainted
anne
and
ever
since
i
have
felt
as
if
i
were
in
a
dream
you
will
soon
adjust
yourself
to
this
new
state
of
things
leslie
and
you
are
young
life
is
before
you
you
will
have
many
beautiful
years
yet
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
look
at
it
in
that
way
after
a
while
anne
just
now
i
feel
too
tired
and
indifferent
to
think
about
the
future
i
i
anne
i
lonely
i
miss
dick
is
it
all
very
strange
do
you
know
i
was
really
fond
of
poor
dick
george
i
suppose
i
should
say
just
as
i
would
have
been
fond
of
a
helpless
child
who
depended
on
me
for
everything
i
would
never
have
admitted
it
i
was
really
ashamed
of
it
because
you
see
i
had
hated
and
despised
dick
so
much
before
he
went
away
when
i
heard
that
captain
jim
was
bringing
him
home
i
expected
i
would
just
feel
the
same
to
him
but
i
never
did
although
i
continued
to
loathe
him
as
i
remembered
him
before
from
the
time
he
came
home
i
felt
only
pity
a
pity
that
hurt
and
wrung
me
i
supposed
then
that
it
was
just
because
his
accident
had
made
him
so
helpless
and
changed
but
now
i
believe
it
was
because
there
was
really
a
different
personality
there
carlo
knew
it
anne
i
know
now
that
carlo
knew
it
i
always
thought
it
strange
that
carlo
have
known
dick
dogs
are
usually
so
faithful
but
he
knew
it
was
not
his
master
who
had
come
back
although
none
of
the
rest
of
us
did
i
had
never
seen
george
moore
you
know
i
remember
now
that
dick
once
mentioned
casually
that
he
had
a
cousin
in
nova
scotia
who
looked
as
much
like
him
as
a
twin
but
the
thing
had
gone
out
of
my
memory
and
in
any
case
i
would
never
have
thought
it
of
any
importance
you
see
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
question
dick
identity
any
change
in
him
seemed
to
me
just
the
result
of
the
accident
oh
anne
that
night
in
april
when
gilbert
told
me
he
thought
dick
might
be
cured
i
can
never
forget
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
once
been
a
prisoner
in
a
hideous
cage
of
torture
and
then
the
door
had
been
opened
and
i
could
get
out
i
was
still
chained
to
the
cage
but
i
was
not
in
it
and
that
night
i
felt
that
a
merciless
hand
was
drawing
me
back
into
the
cage
back
to
a
torture
even
more
terrible
than
it
had
once
been
i
did
blame
gilbert
i
felt
he
was
right
and
he
had
been
very
good
he
said
that
if
in
view
of
the
expense
and
uncertainty
of
the
operation
i
should
decide
not
to
risk
it
he
would
not
blame
me
in
the
least
but
i
knew
how
i
ought
to
decide
and
i
could
face
it
all
night
i
walked
the
floor
like
a
mad
woman
trying
to
compel
myself
to
face
it
i
could
anne
i
thought
i
could
and
when
morning
broke
i
set
my
teeth
and
resolved
that
i
would
i
would
let
things
remain
as
they
were
it
was
very
wicked
i
know
it
would
have
been
just
punishment
for
such
wickedness
if
i
had
just
been
left
to
abide
by
that
decision
i
kept
to
it
all
day
that
afternoon
i
had
to
go
up
to
the
glen
to
do
some
shopping
it
was
one
of
dick
quiet
drowsy
days
so
i
left
him
alone
i
was
gone
a
little
longer
than
i
had
expected
and
he
missed
me
he
felt
lonely
and
when
i
got
home
he
ran
to
meet
me
just
like
a
child
with
such
a
pleased
smile
on
his
face
somehow
anne
i
just
gave
way
then
that
smile
on
his
poor
vacant
face
was
more
than
i
could
endure
i
felt
as
if
i
were
denying
a
child
the
chance
to
grow
and
develop
i
knew
that
i
must
give
him
his
chance
no
matter
what
the
consequences
might
be
so
i
came
over
and
told
gilbert
oh
anne
you
must
have
thought
me
hateful
in
those
weeks
before
i
went
away
i
did
mean
to
be
but
i
could
think
of
anything
except
what
i
had
to
do
and
everything
and
everybody
about
me
were
like
shadows
i
know
i
understood
leslie
and
now
it
is
all
over
your
chain
is
broken
there
is
no
cage
there
is
no
cage
repeated
leslie
absently
plucking
at
the
fringing
grasses
with
her
slender
brown
hands
but
it
does
seem
as
if
there
were
anything
else
anne
you
you
remember
what
i
told
you
of
my
folly
that
night
on
the
i
find
one
does
get
over
being
a
fool
very
quickly
sometimes
i
think
there
are
people
who
are
fools
forever
and
to
be
a
fool
of
that
kind
is
almost
as
bad
as
being
a
a
dog
on
a
chain
you
will
feel
very
differently
after
you
get
over
being
tired
and
bewildered
said
anne
who
knowing
a
certain
thing
that
leslie
did
not
know
did
not
feel
herself
called
upon
to
waste
overmuch
sympathy
leslie
laid
her
splendid
golden
head
against
anne
knee
anyhow
i
have
you
she
said
life
ca
be
altogether
empty
with
such
a
friend
anne
pat
my
head
just
as
if
i
were
a
little
girl
mother
me
a
bit
and
let
me
tell
you
while
my
stubborn
tongue
is
loosed
a
little
just
what
you
and
your
comradeship
have
meant
to
me
since
that
night
i
met
you
on
the
rock
shore
chapter
the
ship
comes
to
harbor
one
morning
when
a
windy
golden
sunrise
was
billowing
over
the
gulf
in
waves
of
light
a
certain
weary
stork
flew
over
the
bar
of
four
winds
harbor
on
his
way
from
the
land
of
evening
stars
under
his
wing
was
tucked
a
sleepy
little
creature
the
stork
was
tired
and
he
looked
wistfully
about
him
he
knew
he
was
somewhere
near
his
destination
but
he
could
not
yet
see
it
the
big
white
on
the
red
sandstone
cliff
had
its
good
points
but
no
stork
possessed
of
any
gumption
would
leave
a
new
velvet
baby
there
an
old
gray
house
surrounded
by
willows
in
a
blossomy
brook
valley
looked
more
promising
but
did
not
seem
quite
the
thing
either
the
staring
green
abode
further
on
was
manifestly
out
of
the
question
then
the
stork
brightened
up
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
very
place
a
little
white
house
nestled
against
a
big
whispering
firwood
with
a
spiral
of
blue
smoke
winding
up
from
its
kitchen
chimney
a
house
which
just
looked
as
if
it
were
meant
for
babies
the
stork
gave
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
and
softly
alighted
on
the
half
an
hour
later
gilbert
ran
down
the
hall
and
tapped
on
the
door
a
drowsy
voice
answered
him
and
in
a
moment
pale
scared
face
peeped
out
from
behind
the
door
marilla
anne
has
sent
me
to
tell
you
that
a
certain
young
gentleman
has
arrived
here
he
has
brought
much
luggage
with
him
but
he
evidently
means
to
stay
for
pity
sake
said
marilla
blankly
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
gilbert
that
it
all
over
why
was
i
called
anne
would
let
us
disturb
you
when
there
was
no
need
nobody
was
called
until
about
two
hours
ago
there
was
no
perilous
this
time
and
and
gilbert
will
this
baby
live
he
certainly
will
he
weighs
ten
pounds
and
why
listen
to
him
nothing
wrong
with
his
lungs
is
there
the
nurse
says
his
hair
will
be
red
anne
is
furious
with
her
and
i
tickled
to
death
that
was
a
wonderful
day
in
the
little
house
of
dreams
the
best
dream
of
all
has
come
true
said
anne
pale
and
rapturous
oh
marilla
i
hardly
dare
believe
it
after
that
horrible
day
last
summer
i
have
had
a
heartache
ever
since
then
but
it
is
gone
now
this
baby
will
take
joy
place
said
marilla
oh
no
no
no
marilla
he
ca
nothing
can
ever
do
that
he
has
his
own
place
my
dear
wee
but
little
joy
has
hers
and
always
will
have
it
if
she
had
lived
she
would
have
been
over
a
year
old
she
would
have
been
toddling
around
on
her
tiny
feet
and
lisping
a
few
words
i
can
see
her
so
plainly
marilla
oh
i
know
now
that
captain
jim
was
right
when
he
said
god
would
manage
better
than
that
my
baby
would
seem
a
stranger
to
me
when
i
found
her
beyond
i
learned
that
this
past
year
i
followed
her
development
day
by
day
and
week
by
week
i
always
shall
i
shall
know
just
how
she
grows
from
year
to
year
and
when
i
meet
her
again
i
know
her
she
wo
be
a
stranger
oh
marilla
look
at
his
dear
darling
toes
is
it
strange
they
should
be
so
perfect
it
would
be
stranger
if
they
were
said
marilla
crisply
now
that
all
was
safely
over
marilla
was
herself
again
oh
i
know
but
it
seems
as
if
they
could
be
quite
finished
you
know
and
they
are
even
to
the
tiny
nails
and
his
hands
just
look
at
his
hands
marilla
they
appear
to
be
a
good
deal
like
hands
marilla
conceded
see
how
he
clings
to
my
finger
i
sure
he
knows
me
already
he
cries
when
the
nurse
takes
him
away
oh
marilla
do
you
think
you
do
think
do
you
that
his
hair
is
going
to
be
red
i
do
see
much
hair
of
any
color
said
marilla
i
would
worry
about
it
if
i
were
you
until
it
becomes
visible
marilla
he
has
hair
look
at
that
fine
little
down
all
over
his
head
anyway
nurse
says
his
eyes
will
be
hazel
and
his
forehead
is
exactly
like
gilbert
and
he
has
the
nicest
little
ears
mrs
doctor
dear
said
susan
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
look
at
his
ears
hair
is
deceitful
and
noses
and
eyes
change
and
you
can
not
tell
what
is
going
to
come
of
them
but
ears
is
ears
from
start
to
finish
and
you
always
know
where
you
are
with
them
just
look
at
their
shape
and
they
are
set
right
back
against
his
precious
head
you
will
never
need
to
be
ashamed
of
his
ears
mrs
doctor
dear
anne
convalescence
was
rapid
and
happy
folks
came
and
worshipped
the
baby
as
people
have
bowed
before
the
kingship
of
the
since
long
before
the
wise
men
of
the
east
knelt
in
homage
to
the
royal
babe
of
the
bethlehem
manger
leslie
slowly
finding
herself
amid
the
new
conditions
of
her
life
hovered
over
it
like
a
beautiful
madonna
miss
cornelia
nursed
it
as
knackily
as
could
any
mother
in
israel
captain
jim
held
the
small
creature
in
his
big
brown
hands
and
gazed
tenderly
at
it
with
eyes
that
saw
the
children
who
had
never
been
born
to
him
what
are
you
going
to
call
him
asked
miss
cornelia
anne
has
settled
his
name
answered
gilbert
james
matthew
after
the
two
finest
gentlemen
i
ever
known
not
even
saving
your
presence
said
anne
with
a
saucy
glance
at
gilbert
gilbert
smiled
i
never
knew
matthew
very
well
he
was
so
shy
we
boys
could
get
acquainted
with
him
but
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
captain
jim
is
one
of
the
rarest
and
finest
souls
god
ever
clothed
in
clay
he
is
so
delighted
over
the
fact
that
we
have
given
his
name
to
our
small
lad
it
seems
he
has
no
other
namesake
well
james
matthew
is
a
name
that
will
wear
well
and
not
fade
in
the
washing
said
miss
cornelia
i
glad
you
did
load
him
down
with
some
highfalutin
romantic
name
that
he
be
ashamed
of
when
he
gets
to
be
a
grandfather
william
drew
at
the
glen
has
called
her
baby
bertie
shakespeare
quite
a
combination
is
it
and
i
glad
you
have
had
much
trouble
picking
on
a
name
some
folks
have
an
awful
time
when
the
stanley
flaggs
first
boy
was
born
there
was
so
much
rivalry
as
to
who
the
child
should
be
named
for
that
the
poor
little
soul
had
to
go
for
two
years
without
a
name
then
a
brother
came
along
and
there
it
was
baby
and
baby
finally
they
called
big
baby
peter
and
little
baby
isaac
after
the
two
grandfathers
and
had
them
both
christened
together
and
each
tried
to
see
if
it
howl
the
other
down
you
know
that
highland
scotch
family
of
macnabs
back
of
the
glen
they
got
twelve
boys
and
the
oldest
and
the
youngest
are
both
called
neil
big
neil
and
little
neil
in
the
same
family
well
i
they
ran
out
of
names
i
have
read
somewhere
laughed
anne
that
the
first
child
is
a
poem
but
the
tenth
is
very
prosy
prose
perhaps
macnab
thought
that
the
twelfth
was
merely
an
old
tale
well
there
something
to
be
said
for
large
families
said
miss
cornelia
with
a
sigh
i
was
an
only
child
for
eight
years
and
i
did
long
for
a
brother
and
sister
mother
told
me
to
pray
for
one
and
pray
i
did
believe
me
well
one
day
aunt
nellie
came
to
me
and
said
there
is
a
little
brother
for
you
upstairs
in
your
room
you
can
go
up
and
see
him
i
was
so
excited
and
delighted
i
just
flew
upstairs
and
old
flagg
lifted
up
the
baby
for
me
to
see
lord
anne
dearie
i
never
was
so
disappointed
in
my
life
you
see
i
been
praying
for
a
brother
two
years
older
than
myself
how
long
did
it
take
you
to
get
over
your
disappointment
asked
anne
amid
her
laughter
well
i
had
a
spite
at
providence
for
a
good
spell
and
for
weeks
i
would
even
look
at
the
baby
nobody
knew
why
for
i
never
told
then
he
began
to
get
real
cute
and
held
out
his
wee
hands
to
me
and
i
began
to
get
fond
of
him
but
i
did
get
really
reconciled
to
him
until
one
day
a
school
chum
came
to
see
him
and
said
she
thought
he
was
awful
small
for
his
age
i
just
got
boiling
mad
and
i
sailed
right
into
her
and
told
her
she
did
know
a
nice
baby
when
she
saw
one
and
ours
was
the
nicest
baby
in
the
world
and
after
that
i
just
worshipped
him
mother
died
before
he
was
three
years
old
and
i
was
sister
and
mother
to
him
both
poor
little
lad
he
was
never
strong
and
he
died
when
he
was
much
over
twenty
seems
to
me
i
have
given
anything
on
earth
anne
dearie
if
he
only
lived
miss
cornelia
sighed
gilbert
had
gone
down
and
leslie
who
had
been
crooning
over
the
small
james
matthew
in
the
dormer
window
laid
him
asleep
in
his
basket
and
went
her
way
as
soon
as
she
was
safely
out
of
earshot
miss
cornelia
bent
forward
and
said
in
a
whisper
anne
dearie
i
a
letter
from
owen
ford
yesterday
he
in
vancouver
just
now
but
he
wants
to
know
if
i
can
board
him
for
a
month
later
on
you
know
what
that
means
well
i
hope
we
doing
right
we
nothing
to
do
with
it
we
could
prevent
him
from
coming
to
four
winds
if
he
wanted
to
said
anne
quickly
she
did
not
like
the
feeling
of
miss
cornelia
whispers
gave
her
and
then
she
weakly
succumbed
herself
do
let
leslie
know
he
is
coming
until
he
is
here
she
said
if
she
found
out
i
feel
sure
she
would
go
away
at
once
she
intends
to
go
in
the
fall
anyhow
she
told
me
so
the
other
day
she
is
going
to
montreal
to
take
up
nursing
and
make
what
she
can
of
her
life
oh
well
anne
dearie
said
miss
cornelia
nodding
sagely
that
is
all
as
it
may
be
you
and
i
have
done
our
part
and
we
must
leave
the
rest
to
higher
hands
chapter
politics
at
four
winds
when
anne
came
downstairs
again
the
island
as
well
as
all
canada
was
in
the
throes
of
a
campaign
preceding
a
general
election
gilbert
who
was
an
ardent
conservative
found
himself
caught
in
the
vortex
being
much
in
demand
for
at
the
various
county
rallies
miss
cornelia
did
not
approve
of
his
mixing
up
in
politics
and
told
anne
so
dave
never
did
it
blythe
will
find
he
is
making
a
mistake
believe
me
politics
is
something
no
decent
man
should
meddle
with
is
the
government
of
the
country
to
be
left
solely
to
the
rogues
then
asked
anne
yes
so
long
as
it
conservative
rogues
said
miss
cornelia
marching
off
with
the
honors
of
war
men
and
politicians
are
all
tarred
with
the
same
brush
the
grits
have
it
laid
on
thicker
than
the
conservatives
that
all
considerably
thicker
but
grit
or
tory
my
advice
to
blythe
is
to
steer
clear
of
politics
first
thing
you
know
he
be
running
an
election
himself
and
going
off
to
ottawa
for
half
the
year
and
leaving
his
practice
to
go
to
the
dogs
ah
well
let
not
borrow
trouble
said
anne
the
rate
of
interest
is
too
high
instead
let
look
at
little
jem
it
should
be
spelled
with
a
is
he
perfectly
beautiful
just
see
the
dimples
in
his
elbows
we
bring
him
up
to
be
a
good
conservative
you
and
i
miss
cornelia
bring
him
up
to
be
a
good
man
said
miss
cornelia
they
scarce
and
valuable
though
mind
you
i
would
like
to
see
him
a
grit
as
for
the
election
you
and
i
may
be
thankful
we
do
live
over
harbor
the
air
there
is
blue
these
days
every
elliott
and
crawford
and
macallister
is
on
the
warpath
loaded
for
bear
this
side
is
peaceful
and
calm
seeing
there
so
few
men
captain
jim
a
grit
but
it
my
opinion
he
ashamed
of
it
for
he
never
talks
politics
there
any
earthly
doubt
that
the
conservatives
will
be
returned
with
a
big
majority
again
miss
cornelia
was
mistaken
on
the
morning
after
the
election
captain
jim
dropped
in
at
the
little
house
to
tell
the
news
so
virulent
is
the
microbe
of
party
politics
even
in
a
peaceable
old
man
that
captain
jim
cheeks
were
flushed
and
his
eyes
were
flashing
with
all
his
fire
mistress
blythe
the
liberals
are
in
with
a
sweeping
majority
after
eighteen
years
of
tory
mismanagement
this
country
is
going
to
have
a
chance
at
last
i
never
heard
you
make
such
a
bitter
partisan
speech
before
captain
jim
i
did
think
you
had
so
much
political
venom
in
you
laughed
anne
who
was
not
much
excited
over
the
tidings
little
jem
had
said
that
morning
what
were
principalities
and
powers
the
rise
and
fall
of
dynasties
the
overthrow
of
grit
or
tory
compared
with
that
miraculous
occurrence
it
been
accumulating
for
a
long
while
said
captain
jim
with
a
deprecating
smile
i
thought
i
was
only
a
moderate
grit
but
when
the
news
came
that
we
were
in
i
found
out
how
gritty
i
really
was
you
know
the
doctor
and
i
are
conservatives
ah
well
it
the
only
bad
thing
i
know
of
either
of
you
mistress
blythe
cornelia
is
a
tory
too
i
called
in
on
my
way
from
the
glen
to
tell
her
the
news
did
you
know
you
took
your
life
in
your
hands
yes
but
i
could
resist
the
temptation
how
did
she
take
it
comparatively
calm
mistress
blythe
comparatively
calm
she
says
says
she
providence
sends
seasons
of
humiliation
to
a
country
same
as
to
individuals
you
grits
have
been
cold
and
hungry
for
many
a
year
make
haste
to
get
warmed
and
fed
for
you
wo
be
in
long
now
cornelia
i
says
providence
thinks
canada
needs
a
real
long
spell
of
humiliation
ah
susan
have
you
heard
the
news
the
liberals
are
in
susan
had
just
come
in
from
the
kitchen
attended
by
the
odor
of
delectable
dishes
which
always
seemed
to
hover
around
her
now
are
they
she
said
with
beautiful
unconcern
well
i
never
could
see
but
that
my
bread
rose
just
as
light
when
grits
were
in
as
when
they
were
not
and
if
any
party
mrs
doctor
dear
will
make
it
rain
before
the
week
is
out
and
save
our
kitchen
garden
from
entire
ruination
that
is
the
party
susan
will
vote
for
in
the
meantime
will
you
just
step
out
and
give
me
your
opinion
on
the
meat
for
dinner
i
am
fearing
that
it
is
very
tough
and
i
think
that
we
had
better
change
our
butcher
as
well
as
our
government
one
evening
a
week
later
anne
walked
down
to
the
point
to
see
if
she
could
get
some
fresh
fish
from
captain
jim
leaving
little
jem
for
the
first
time
it
was
quite
a
tragedy
suppose
he
cried
suppose
susan
did
not
know
just
exactly
what
to
do
for
him
susan
was
calm
and
serene
i
have
had
as
much
experience
with
him
as
you
mrs
doctor
dear
have
i
not
yes
with
him
but
not
with
other
babies
why
i
looked
after
three
pairs
of
twins
when
i
was
a
child
susan
when
they
cried
i
gave
them
peppermint
or
castor
oil
quite
coolly
it
quite
curious
now
to
recall
how
lightly
i
took
all
those
babies
and
their
woes
oh
well
if
little
jem
cries
i
will
just
clap
a
hot
water
bag
on
his
little
stomach
said
susan
not
too
hot
you
know
said
anne
anxiously
oh
was
it
really
wise
to
go
do
not
you
fret
mrs
doctor
dear
susan
is
not
the
woman
to
burn
a
wee
man
bless
him
he
has
no
notion
of
crying
anne
tore
herself
away
finally
and
enjoyed
her
walk
to
the
point
after
all
through
the
long
shadows
of
the
captain
jim
was
not
in
the
living
room
of
the
lighthouse
but
another
man
was
a
handsome
man
with
a
strong
chin
who
was
unknown
to
anne
nevertheless
when
she
sat
down
he
began
to
talk
to
her
with
all
the
assurance
of
an
old
acquaintance
there
was
nothing
amiss
in
what
he
said
or
the
way
he
said
it
but
anne
rather
resented
such
a
cool
in
a
complete
stranger
her
replies
were
frosty
and
as
few
as
decency
required
nothing
daunted
her
companion
talked
on
for
several
minutes
then
excused
himself
and
went
away
anne
could
have
sworn
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
it
annoyed
her
who
was
the
creature
there
was
something
vaguely
familiar
about
him
but
she
was
certain
she
had
never
seen
him
before
captain
jim
who
was
that
who
just
went
out
she
asked
as
captain
jim
came
in
marshall
elliott
answered
the
captain
marshall
elliott
cried
anne
oh
captain
jim
it
was
yes
it
was
his
voice
oh
captain
jim
i
did
know
him
and
i
was
quite
insulting
to
him
why
did
he
tell
me
he
must
have
seen
i
know
him
he
would
say
a
word
about
it
he
just
enjoy
the
joke
worry
over
snubbing
him
he
think
it
fun
yes
marshall
shaved
off
his
beard
at
last
and
cut
his
hair
his
party
is
in
you
know
i
did
know
him
myself
first
time
i
saw
him
he
was
up
in
carter
flagg
store
at
the
glen
the
night
after
election
day
along
with
a
crowd
of
others
waiting
for
the
news
about
twelve
the
came
through
the
liberals
were
in
marshall
just
got
up
and
walked
out
he
did
cheer
or
shout
he
left
the
others
to
do
that
and
they
nearly
lifted
the
roof
off
carter
store
i
reckon
of
course
all
the
tories
were
over
in
raymond
russell
store
not
much
cheering
there
marshall
went
straight
down
the
street
to
the
side
door
of
augustus
palmer
barber
shop
augustus
was
in
bed
asleep
but
marhall
hammered
on
the
door
until
he
got
up
and
come
down
wanting
to
know
what
all
the
racket
was
about
come
into
your
shop
and
do
the
best
job
you
ever
did
in
your
life
gus
said
marshall
liberals
are
in
and
you
going
to
barber
a
good
grit
before
the
sun
rises
gus
was
mad
as
hops
partly
because
he
been
dragged
out
of
bed
but
more
because
he
a
tory
he
vowed
he
would
shave
any
man
after
twelve
at
night
do
what
i
want
you
to
do
sonny
said
marshall
i
jest
turn
you
over
my
knee
and
give
you
one
of
those
spankings
your
mother
forgot
he
have
done
it
too
and
gus
knew
it
for
marshall
is
as
strong
as
an
ox
and
gus
is
only
a
midget
of
a
man
so
he
gave
in
and
towed
marshall
in
to
the
shop
and
went
to
work
says
he
barber
you
up
but
if
you
say
one
word
to
me
about
the
grits
getting
in
while
i
doing
it
i
cut
your
throat
with
this
razor
says
he
you
would
have
thought
mild
little
gus
could
be
so
bloodthirsty
would
you
shows
what
party
politics
will
do
for
a
man
marshall
kept
quiet
and
got
his
hair
and
beard
disposed
of
and
went
home
when
his
old
housekeeper
heard
him
come
upstairs
she
peeked
out
of
her
bedroom
door
to
see
whether
was
him
or
the
hired
boy
and
when
she
saw
a
strange
man
striding
down
the
hall
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
she
screamed
blue
murder
and
fainted
dead
away
they
had
to
send
for
the
doctor
before
they
could
bring
her
to
and
it
was
several
days
before
she
could
look
at
marshall
without
shaking
all
over
captain
jim
had
no
fish
he
seldom
went
out
in
his
boat
that
summer
and
his
long
tramping
expeditions
were
over
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
his
time
sitting
by
his
seaward
window
looking
out
over
the
gulf
with
his
head
leaning
on
his
hand
he
sat
there
tonight
for
many
silent
minutes
keeping
some
tryst
with
the
past
which
anne
would
not
disturb
presently
he
pointed
to
the
iris
of
the
west
that
beautiful
is
it
mistress
blythe
but
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
the
sunrise
this
morning
it
was
a
wonderful
thing
wonderful
i
seen
all
kinds
of
sunrises
come
over
that
gulf
i
been
all
over
the
world
mistress
blythe
and
take
it
all
in
all
i
never
seen
a
finer
sight
than
a
summer
sunrise
over
the
gulf
a
man
ca
pick
his
time
for
dying
mistress
blythe
jest
got
to
go
when
the
great
captain
gives
his
sailing
orders
but
if
i
could
i
go
out
when
the
morning
comes
across
that
water
i
watched
it
many
a
time
and
thought
what
a
thing
it
would
be
to
pass
out
through
that
great
white
glory
to
whatever
was
waiting
beyant
on
a
sea
that
ai
mapped
out
on
any
airthly
chart
i
think
mistress
blythe
that
i
find
lost
margaret
there
captain
jim
had
often
talked
to
anne
of
lost
margaret
since
he
had
told
her
the
old
story
his
love
for
her
trembled
in
every
tone
that
love
that
had
never
grown
faint
or
forgetful
anyway
i
hope
when
my
time
comes
i
go
quick
and
easy
i
think
i
a
coward
mistress
blythe
i
looked
an
ugly
death
in
the
face
more
than
once
without
blenching
but
the
thought
of
a
lingering
death
does
give
me
a
queer
sick
feeling
of
horror
do
talk
about
leaving
us
dear
dear
captain
jim
pleaded
anne
in
a
choked
voice
patting
the
old
brown
hand
once
so
strong
but
now
grown
very
feeble
what
would
we
do
without
you
captain
jim
smiled
beautifully
oh
you
get
along
nicely
nicely
but
you
would
forget
the
old
man
altogether
mistress
blythe
no
i
do
think
you
ever
quite
forget
him
the
race
of
joseph
always
remembers
one
another
but
it
be
a
memory
that
wo
hurt
i
like
to
think
that
my
memory
hurt
my
friends
it
always
be
kind
of
pleasant
to
them
i
hope
and
believe
it
wo
be
very
long
now
before
lost
margaret
calls
me
for
the
last
time
i
be
all
ready
to
answer
i
jest
spoke
of
this
because
there
a
little
favor
i
want
to
ask
you
here
this
poor
old
matey
of
mine
captain
jim
reached
out
a
hand
and
poked
the
big
warm
velvety
golden
ball
on
the
sofa
the
first
mate
uncoiled
himself
like
a
spring
with
a
nice
throaty
comfortable
sound
half
purr
half
meow
stretched
his
paws
in
air
turned
over
and
coiled
himself
up
again
he
miss
me
when
i
start
on
the
i
ca

poor
critter

me

those
pretty
eyes

spell

heard

a
piece
of
poetry
one
day
last
winter

of
tennyson
pieces

sorter
like
to
hear
it
again
if
you
could
recite
it
for
me
softly
and
clearly
while
the
seawind
blew
in
on
them
anne
repeated
the
beautiful
lines
of
tennyson
wonderful
swan
song
crossing
the
bar
the
old
captain
kept
time
gently
with
his
sinewy
hand
yes
yes

blythe
he
said
when
she
had
finished
it
that
it
he
was
a
sailor

dunno
how
he
could
have
put

old
sailor

o
farewells

anne
folding
up
marilla
letter
jake
donnell
has
been
there
shingling
the
roof
he
is
a
carpenter
now
so
it
seems
he
has
had
his
own
way
in
regard
to
the
choice
of
a
you
remember
his
mother
wanted
him
to
be
a
college
professor
i
shall
never
forget
the
day
she
came
to
the
school
and
rated
me
for
failing
to
call
him
st
clair
does
anyone
ever
call
him
that
now
evidently
not
it
seems
that
he
has
completely
lived
it
down
even
his
mother
has
succumbed
i
always
thought
that
a
boy
with
jake
chin
and
mouth
would
get
his
own
way
in
the
end
diana
writes
me
that
dora
has
a
beau
just
think
of
it
that
child
dora
is
seventeen
said
gilbert
charlie
sloane
and
i
were
both
mad
about
you
when
you
were
seventeen
anne
really
gilbert
we
must
be
getting
on
in
years
said
anne
with
a
smile
when
children
who
were
six
when
we
thought
ourselves
grown
up
are
old
enough
now
to
have
beaux
dora
is
ralph
andrews
jane
brother
i
remember
him
as
a
little
round
fat
fellow
who
was
always
at
the
foot
of
his
class
but
i
understand
he
is
quite
a
young
man
now
dora
will
probably
marry
young
she
of
the
same
type
as
charlotta
the
fourth
she
never
miss
her
first
chance
for
fear
she
might
not
get
another
well
if
she
marries
ralph
i
hope
he
will
be
a
little
more
than
his
brother
billy
mused
anne
for
instance
said
gilbert
laughing
let
us
hope
he
will
be
able
to
propose
on
his
own
account
anne
would
you
have
married
billy
if
he
had
asked
you
himself
instead
of
getting
jane
to
do
it
for
him
i
might
have
anne
went
off
into
a
shriek
of
laughter
over
the
recollection
of
her
first
proposal
the
shock
of
the
whole
thing
might
have
hypnotized
me
into
some
such
rash
and
foolish
act
let
us
be
thankful
he
did
it
by
proxy
i
had
a
letter
from
george
moore
yesterday
said
leslie
from
the
corner
where
she
was
reading
oh
how
is
he
asked
anne
interestedly
yet
with
an
unreal
feeling
that
she
was
inquiring
about
some
one
whom
she
did
not
know
he
is
well
but
he
finds
it
very
hard
to
adapt
himself
to
all
the
changes
in
his
old
home
and
friends
he
is
going
to
sea
again
in
the
spring
it
in
his
blood
he
says
and
he
longs
for
it
but
he
told
me
something
that
made
me
glad
for
him
poor
fellow
before
he
sailed
on
the
four
sisters
he
was
engaged
to
a
girl
at
home
he
did
not
tell
me
anything
about
her
in
montreal
because
he
said
he
supposed
she
would
have
forgotten
him
and
married
someone
else
long
ago
and
with
him
you
see
his
engagement
and
love
was
still
a
thing
of
the
present
it
was
pretty
hard
on
him
but
when
he
got
home
he
found
she
had
never
married
and
still
cared
for
him
they
are
to
be
married
this
fall
i
going
to
ask
him
to
bring
her
over
here
for
a
little
trip
he
says
he
wants
to
come
and
see
the
place
where
he
lived
so
many
years
without
knowing
it
what
a
nice
little
romance
said
anne
whose
love
for
the
romantic
was
immortal
and
to
think
she
added
with
a
sigh
of
that
if
i
had
had
my
way
george
moore
would
never
have
come
up
from
the
grave
in
which
his
identity
was
buried
how
i
did
fight
against
gilbert
suggestion
well
i
am
punished
i
shall
never
be
able
to
have
a
different
opinion
from
gilbert
again
if
i
try
to
have
he
will
squelch
me
by
casting
george
moore
case
up
to
me
as
if
even
that
would
squelch
a
woman
mocked
gilbert
at
least
do
not
become
my
echo
anne
a
little
opposition
gives
spice
to
life
i
do
not
want
a
wife
like
john
macallister
over
the
harbor
no
matter
what
he
says
she
at
once
remarks
in
that
drab
lifeless
little
voice
of
hers
is
very
true
john
dear
me
anne
and
leslie
laughed
anne
laughter
was
silver
and
golden
and
the
combination
of
the
two
was
as
satisfactory
as
a
perfect
chord
in
music
susan
coming
in
on
the
heels
of
the
laughter
echoed
it
with
a
resounding
sigh
why
susan
what
is
the
matter
asked
gilbert
there
nothing
wrong
with
little
jem
is
there
susan
cried
anne
starting
up
in
alarm
no
no
calm
yourself
mrs
doctor
dear
something
has
happened
though
dear
me
everything
has
gone
catawampus
with
me
this
week
i
spoiled
the
bread
as
you
know
too
well
and
i
scorched
the
best
shirt
bosom
and
i
broke
your
big
platter
and
now
on
the
top
of
all
this
comes
word
that
my
sister
matilda
has
broken
her
leg
and
wants
me
to
go
and
stay
with
her
for
a
spell
oh
i
very
sorry
sorry
that
your
sister
has
met
with
such
an
accident
i
mean
exclaimed
anne
ah
well
man
was
made
to
mourn
mrs
doctor
dear
that
sounds
as
if
it
ought
to
be
in
the
bible
but
they
tell
me
a
person
named
burns
wrote
it
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
we
are
born
to
trouble
as
the
sparks
fly
upward
as
for
matilda
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
of
her
none
of
our
family
ever
broke
their
legs
before
but
whatever
she
has
done
she
is
still
my
sister
and
i
feel
that
it
is
my
duty
to
go
and
wait
on
her
if
you
can
spare
me
for
a
few
weeks
mrs
doctor
dear
of
course
susan
of
course
i
can
get
someone
to
help
me
while
you
are
gone
if
you
can
not
i
will
not
go
mrs
doctor
dear
matilda
leg
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
i
will
not
have
you
worried
and
that
blessed
child
upset
in
consequence
for
any
number
of
legs
oh
you
must
go
to
your
sister
at
once
susan
i
can
get
a
girl
from
the
cove
who
will
do
for
a
time
anne
will
you
let
me
come
and
stay
with
you
while
susan
is
away
exclaimed
leslie
do
i
love
to
and
it
would
be
an
act
of
charity
on
your
part
i
so
horribly
lonely
over
there
in
that
big
barn
of
a
house
there
so
little
to
do
and
at
night
i
worse
than
lonely
i
frightened
and
nervous
in
spite
of
locked
doors
there
was
a
tramp
around
two
days
ago
anne
joyfully
agreed
and
next
day
leslie
was
installed
as
an
inmate
of
the
little
house
of
dreams
miss
cornelia
warmly
approved
of
the
arrangement
it
seems
providential
she
told
anne
in
confidence
i
sorry
for
matilda
clow
but
since
she
had
to
break
her
leg
it
could
have
happened
at
a
better
time
leslie
will
be
here
while
owen
ford
is
in
four
winds
and
those
old
cats
up
at
the
glen
wo
get
the
chance
to
meow
as
they
would
if
she
was
living
over
there
alone
and
owen
going
to
see
her
they
are
doing
enough
of
it
as
it
is
because
she
put
on
mourning
i
said
to
one
of
them
you
mean
she
should
put
on
mourning
for
george
moore
it
seems
to
me
more
like
his
resurrection
than
his
funeral
and
if
it
dick
you
mean
i
confess
ca
see
the
propriety
of
going
into
weeds
for
a
man
who
died
thirteen
years
ago
and
good
riddance
then
and
when
old
louisa
baldwin
remarked
to
me
that
she
thought
it
very
strange
that
leslie
should
never
have
suspected
it
was
her
own
husband
said
never
suspected
it
was
dick
moore
and
you
were
neighbor
to
him
all
his
life
and
by
nature
you
ten
times
as
suspicious
as
leslie
but
you
stop
some
people
tongues
anne
dearie
and
i
real
thankful
leslie
will
be
under
your
roof
while
owen
is
courting
her
owen
ford
came
to
the
little
house
one
august
evening
when
leslie
and
anne
were
absorbed
in
worshipping
the
baby
he
paused
at
the
open
door
of
the
living
room
unseen
by
the
two
within
gazing
with
greedy
eyes
at
the
beautiful
picture
leslie
sat
on
the
floor
with
the
baby
in
her
lap
making
ecstatic
dabs
at
his
fat
little
hands
as
he
fluttered
them
in
the
air
oh
you
dear
beautiful
beloved
baby
she
mumbled
catching
one
wee
hand
and
covering
it
with
kisses
is
him
ze
darlingest
itty
sing
crooned
anne
hanging
over
the
arm
of
her
chair
adoringly
dem
itty
wee
pads
are
ze
very
tweetest
handies
in
ze
whole
big
world
is
dey
you
darling
itty
man
anne
in
the
months
before
little
jem
coming
had
pored
diligently
over
several
wise
volumes
and
pinned
her
faith
to
one
in
especial
sir
oracle
on
the
care
and
training
of
children
sir
oracle
implored
parents
by
all
they
held
sacred
never
to
talk
baby
talk
to
their
children
infants
should
invariably
be
addressed
in
classical
language
from
the
moment
of
their
birth
so
should
they
learn
to
speak
english
undefiled
from
their
earliest
utterance
how
demanded
sir
oracle
can
a
mother
reasonably
expect
her
child
to
learn
correct
speech
when
she
continually
accustoms
its
impressionable
gray
matter
to
such
absurd
expressions
and
distortions
of
our
noble
tongue
as
thoughtless
mothers
inflict
every
day
on
the
helpless
creatures
committed
to
their
care
can
a
child
who
is
constantly
called
itty
wee
singie
ever
attain
to
any
proper
conception
of
his
own
being
and
possibilities
and
destiny
anne
was
vastly
impressed
with
this
and
informed
gilbert
that
she
meant
to
make
it
an
inflexible
rule
never
under
any
circumstances
to
talk
baby
talk
to
her
children
gilbert
agreed
with
her
and
they
made
a
solemn
compact
on
the
subject
a
compact
which
anne
shamelessly
violated
the
very
first
moment
little
jem
was
laid
in
her
arms
oh
the
darling
itty
wee
sing
she
had
exclaimed
and
she
had
continued
to
violate
it
ever
since
when
gilbert
teased
her
she
laughed
sir
oracle
to
scorn
he
never
had
any
children
of
his
own
gilbert
i
am
positive
he
or
he
would
never
have
written
such
rubbish
you
just
ca
help
talking
baby
talk
to
a
baby
it
comes
natural
and
it
right
it
would
be
inhuman
to
talk
to
those
tiny
soft
velvety
little
creatures
as
we
do
to
great
big
boys
and
girls
babies
want
love
and
cuddling
and
all
the
sweet
baby
talk
they
can
get
and
little
jem
is
going
to
have
it
bless
his
dear
itty
heartums
but
you
the
worst
i
ever
heard
anne
protested
gilbert
who
not
being
a
mother
but
only
a
father
was
not
wholly
convinced
yet
that
sir
oracle
was
wrong
i
never
heard
anything
like
the
way
you
talk
to
that
child
very
likely
you
never
did
go
away
go
away
did
i
bring
up
three
pairs
of
hammond
twins
before
i
was
eleven
you
and
sir
oracle
are
nothing
but
theorists
gilbert
just
look
at
him
smiling
at
me
he
knows
what
we
talking
about
and
oo
dest
agwees
wif
evy
word
muzzer
says
do
oo
gilbert
put
his
arm
about
them
oh
you
mothers
he
said
you
mothers
god
knew
what
he
was
about
when
he
made
you
so
little
jem
was
talked
to
and
loved
and
cuddled
and
he
throve
as
became
a
child
of
the
house
of
dreams
leslie
was
quite
as
foolish
over
him
as
anne
was
when
their
work
was
done
and
gilbert
was
out
of
the
way
they
gave
themselves
over
to
shameless
orgies
of
and
ecstasies
of
adoration
such
as
that
in
which
owen
ford
had
surprised
them
leslie
was
the
first
to
become
aware
of
him
even
in
the
twilight
anne
could
see
the
sudden
whiteness
that
swept
over
her
beautiful
face
blotting
out
the
crimson
of
lip
and
cheeks
owen
came
forward
eagerly
blind
for
a
moment
to
anne
leslie
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
called
her
by
her
name
but
the
hand
leslie
gave
him
was
cold
and
she
was
very
quiet
all
the
evening
while
anne
and
gilbert
and
owen
laughed
and
talked
together
before
his
call
ended
she
excused
herself
and
went
upstairs
owen
gay
spirits
flagged
and
he
went
away
soon
after
with
a
downcast
air
gilbert
looked
at
anne
anne
what
are
you
up
to
there
something
going
on
that
i
understand
the
whole
air
here
tonight
has
been
charged
with
electricity
leslie
sits
like
the
muse
of
tragedy
owen
ford
jokes
and
laughs
on
the
surface
and
watches
leslie
with
the
eyes
of
his
soul
you
seem
all
the
time
to
be
bursting
with
some
suppressed
excitement
own
up
what
secret
have
you
been
keeping
from
your
deceived
husband
do
be
a
goose
gilbert
was
anne
conjugal
reply
as
for
leslie
she
is
absurd
and
i
going
up
to
tell
her
so
anne
found
leslie
at
the
dormer
window
of
her
room
the
little
place
was
filled
with
the
rhythmic
thunder
of
the
sea
leslie
sat
with
locked
hands
in
the
misty
moonshine
a
beautiful
accusing
presence
anne
she
said
in
a
low
reproachful
voice
did
you
know
owen
ford
was
coming
to
four
winds
i
did
said
anne
brazenly
oh
you
should
have
told
me
anne
leslie
cried
passionately
if
i
had
known
i
would
have
gone
away
i
would
have
stayed
here
to
meet
him
you
should
have
told
me
it
was
fair
of
you
anne
oh
it
was
fair
leslie
lips
were
trembling
and
her
whole
form
was
tense
with
emotion
but
anne
laughed
heartlessly
she
bent
over
and
kissed
upturned
reproachful
face
leslie
you
are
an
adorable
goose
owen
ford
did
rush
from
the
pacific
to
the
atlantic
from
a
burning
desire
to
see
me
neither
do
i
believe
that
he
was
inspired
by
any
wild
and
frenzied
passion
for
miss
cornelia
take
off
your
tragic
airs
my
dear
friend
and
fold
them
up
and
put
them
away
in
lavender
you
never
need
them
again
there
are
some
people
who
can
see
through
a
grindstone
when
there
is
a
hole
in
it
even
if
you
can
not
i
am
not
a
prophetess
but
i
shall
venture
on
a
prediction
the
bitterness
of
life
is
over
for
you
after
this
you
are
going
to
have
the
joys
and
hopes
and
i
daresay
the
sorrows
too
of
a
happy
woman
the
omen
of
the
shadow
of
venus
did
come
true
for
you
leslie
the
year
in
which
you
saw
it
brought
your
life
best
gift
for
you
your
love
for
owen
ford
now
go
right
to
bed
and
have
a
good
sleep
leslie
obeyed
orders
in
so
far
that
she
went
to
bed
but
it
may
be
questioned
if
she
slept
much
i
do
not
think
she
dared
to
dream
wakingly
life
had
been
so
hard
for
this
poor
leslie
the
path
on
which
she
had
had
to
walk
had
been
so
strait
that
she
could
not
whisper
to
her
own
heart
the
hopes
that
might
wait
on
the
future
but
she
watched
the
great
revolving
light
bestarring
the
short
hours
of
the
summer
night
and
her
eyes
grew
soft
and
bright
and
young
once
more
nor
when
owen
ford
came
next
day
to
ask
her
to
go
with
him
to
the
shore
did
she
say
him
nay
chapter
miss
cornelia
makes
a
startling
announcement
miss
cornelia
sailed
down
to
the
little
house
one
drowsy
afternoon
when
the
gulf
was
the
faint
bleached
blue
of
the
august
seas
and
the
orange
lilies
at
the
gate
of
anne
garden
held
up
their
imperial
cups
to
be
filled
with
the
molten
gold
of
august
sunshine
not
that
miss
cornelia
concerned
herself
with
painted
oceans
or
lilies
she
sat
in
her
favorite
rocker
in
unusual
idleness
she
sewed
not
neither
did
she
spin
nor
did
she
say
a
single
derogatory
word
concerning
any
portion
of
mankind
in
short
miss
conversation
was
singularly
devoid
of
spice
that
day
and
gilbert
who
had
stayed
home
to
listen
to
her
instead
of
going
as
he
had
intended
felt
himself
aggrieved
what
had
come
over
miss
cornelia
she
did
not
look
cast
down
or
worried
on
the
contrary
there
was
a
certain
air
of
nervous
exultation
about
her
where
is
leslie
she
asked
not
as
if
it
mattered
much
either
owen
and
she
went
raspberrying
in
the
woods
back
of
her
farm
answered
anne
they
wo
be
back
before
supper
time
if
then
they
do
seem
to
have
any
idea
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
clock
said
gilbert
i
ca
get
to
the
bottom
of
that
affair
certain
you
women
pulled
strings
but
anne
undutiful
wife
wo
tell
me
will
you
miss
cornelia
no
i
shall
not
but
said
miss
cornelia
with
the
air
of
one
determined
to
take
the
plunge
and
have
it
over
i
will
tell
you
something
else
i
came
today
on
purpose
to
tell
it
i
am
going
to
be
married
anne
and
gilbert
were
silent
if
miss
cornelia
had
announced
her
intention
of
going
out
to
the
channel
and
drowning
herself
the
thing
might
have
been
believable
this
was
not
so
they
waited
of
course
miss
cornelia
had
made
a
mistake
well
you
both
look
sort
of
kerflummexed
said
miss
cornelia
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eyes
now
that
the
awkward
moment
of
revelation
was
over
miss
cornelia
was
her
own
woman
again
do
you
think
i
too
young
and
inexperienced
for
matrimony
you
know
it
is
rather
staggering
said
gilbert
trying
to
gather
his
wits
together
i
heard
you
say
a
score
of
times
that
you
marry
the
best
man
in
the
world
i
not
going
to
marry
the
best
man
in
the
world
retorted
miss
cornelia
marshall
elliott
is
a
long
way
from
being
the
best
are
you
going
to
marry
marshall
elliott
exclaimed
anne
recovering
her
power
of
speech
under
this
second
shock
yes
i
could
have
had
him
any
time
these
twenty
years
if
i
lifted
my
finger
but
do
you
suppose
i
was
going
to
walk
into
church
beside
a
perambulating
haystack
like
that
i
am
sure
we
are
very
glad
and
we
wish
you
all
possible
happiness
said
anne
very
flatly
and
inadequately
as
she
felt
she
was
not
prepared
for
such
an
occasion
she
had
never
imagined
herself
offering
betrothal
felicitations
to
miss
cornelia
thanks
i
knew
you
would
said
miss
cornelia
you
are
the
first
of
my
friends
to
know
it
we
shall
be
so
sorry
to
lose
you
though
dear
miss
cornelia
said
anne
beginning
to
be
a
little
sad
and
sentimental
oh
you
wo
lose
me
said
miss
cornelia
unsentimentally
you
do
suppose
i
would
live
over
harbor
with
all
those
macallisters
and
elliotts
and
crawfords
do
you
the
conceit
of
the
elliotts
the
pride
of
the
macallisters
and
the
of
the
crawfords
good
lord
deliver
us
marshall
is
coming
to
live
at
my
place
i
sick
and
tired
of
hired
men
that
jim
hastings
i
got
this
summer
is
positively
the
worst
of
the
species
he
would
drive
anyone
to
getting
married
what
do
you
think
he
upset
the
churn
yesterday
and
spilled
a
big
churning
of
cream
over
the
yard
and
not
one
whit
concerned
about
it
was
he
just
gave
a
foolish
laugh
and
said
cream
was
good
for
the
land
was
that
like
a
man
i
told
him
i
was
in
the
habit
of
fertilising
my
back
yard
with
cream
well
i
wish
you
all
manner
of
happiness
too
miss
cornelia
said
gilbert
solemnly
but
he
added
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
to
tease
miss
cornelia
despite
anne
imploring
eyes
i
fear
your
day
of
independence
is
done
as
you
know
marshall
elliott
is
a
very
determined
man
i
like
a
man
who
can
stick
to
a
thing
retorted
miss
cornelia
amos
grant
who
used
to
be
after
me
long
ago
could
you
never
saw
such
a
he
jumped
into
the
pond
to
drown
himself
once
and
then
changed
his
mind
and
swum
out
again
was
that
like
a
man
marshall
would
have
stuck
to
it
and
drowned
and
he
has
a
bit
of
a
temper
they
tell
me
persisted
gilbert
he
would
be
an
elliott
if
he
had
i
thankful
he
has
it
will
be
real
fun
to
make
him
mad
and
you
can
generally
do
something
with
a
tempery
man
when
it
comes
to
repenting
time
but
you
ca
do
anything
with
a
man
who
just
keeps
placid
and
aggravating
you
know
he
a
grit
miss
cornelia
yes
he
is
admitted
miss
cornelia
rather
sadly
and
of
course
there
is
no
hope
of
making
a
conservative
of
him
but
at
least
he
is
a
presbyterian
so
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
be
satisfied
with
that
would
you
marry
him
if
he
were
a
methodist
miss
cornelia
no
i
would
not
politics
is
for
this
world
but
religion
is
for
both
and
you
may
be
a
after
all
miss
cornelia
not
marshall
will
live
me
out
the
elliotts
are
and
the
bryants
are
not
when
are
you
to
be
married
asked
anne
in
about
a
month
time
my
wedding
dress
is
to
be
navy
blue
silk
and
i
want
to
ask
you
anne
dearie
if
you
think
it
would
be
all
right
to
wear
a
veil
with
a
navy
blue
dress
i
always
thought
i
like
to
wear
a
veil
if
i
ever
got
married
marshall
says
to
have
it
if
i
want
to
is
that
like
a
man
why
should
you
wear
it
if
you
want
to
asked
anne
well
one
does
want
to
be
different
from
other
people
said
miss
cornelia
who
was
not
noticeably
like
anyone
else
on
the
face
of
the
earth
as
i
say
i
do
fancy
a
veil
but
maybe
it
should
be
worn
with
any
dress
but
a
white
one
please
tell
me
anne
dearie
what
you
really
think
i
go
by
your
advice
i
do
think
veils
are
usually
worn
with
any
but
white
dresses
admitted
anne
but
that
is
merely
a
convention
and
i
am
like
elliott
miss
cornelia
i
do
see
any
good
reason
why
you
have
a
veil
if
you
want
one
but
miss
cornelia
who
made
her
calls
in
calico
wrappers
shook
her
head
if
it
is
the
proper
thing
i
wo
wear
it
she
said
with
a
sigh
of
regret
for
a
lost
dream
since
you
are
determined
to
be
married
miss
cornelia
said
gilbert
solemnly
i
shall
give
you
the
excellent
rules
for
the
management
of
a
husband
which
my
grandmother
gave
my
mother
when
she
married
my
father
well
i
reckon
i
can
manage
marshall
elliott
said
miss
cornelia
placidly
but
let
us
hear
your
rules
the
first
one
is
catch
him
he
caught
go
on
the
second
one
is
feed
him
well
with
enough
pie
what
next
the
third
and
fourth
are
keep
your
eye
on
him
i
believe
you
said
miss
cornelia
emphatically
chapter
red
roses
the
garden
of
the
little
house
was
a
haunt
beloved
of
bees
and
reddened
by
late
roses
that
august
the
little
house
folk
lived
much
in
it
and
were
given
to
taking
picnic
suppers
in
the
grassy
corner
beyond
the
brook
and
sitting
about
in
it
through
the
twilights
when
great
night
moths
sailed
athwart
the
velvet
gloom
one
evening
owen
ford
found
leslie
alone
in
it
anne
and
gilbert
were
away
and
susan
who
was
expected
back
that
night
had
not
yet
returned
the
northern
sky
was
amber
and
pale
green
over
the
fir
tops
the
air
was
cool
for
august
was
nearing
september
and
leslie
wore
a
crimson
scarf
over
her
white
dress
together
they
wandered
through
the
little
friendly
paths
in
silence
owen
must
go
soon
his
holiday
was
nearly
over
leslie
found
her
heart
beating
wildly
she
knew
that
this
beloved
garden
was
to
be
the
scene
of
the
binding
words
that
must
seal
their
as
yet
unworded
understanding
some
evenings
a
strange
odor
blows
down
the
air
of
this
garden
like
a
phantom
perfume
said
owen
i
have
never
been
able
to
discover
from
just
what
flower
it
comes
it
is
elusive
and
haunting
and
wonderfully
sweet
i
like
to
fancy
it
is
the
soul
of
grandmother
selwyn
passing
on
a
little
visit
to
the
old
spot
she
loved
so
well
there
should
be
a
lot
of
friendly
ghosts
about
this
little
old
house
i
have
lived
under
its
roof
only
a
month
said
leslie
but
i
love
it
as
i
never
loved
the
house
over
there
where
i
have
lived
all
my
life
this
house
was
builded
and
consecrated
by
love
said
owen
such
houses
must
exert
an
influence
over
those
who
live
in
them
and
this
garden
it
is
over
sixty
years
old
and
the
history
of
a
thousand
hopes
and
joys
is
written
in
its
blossoms
some
of
those
flowers
were
actually
set
out
by
the
schoolmaster
bride
and
she
has
been
dead
for
thirty
years
yet
they
bloom
on
every
summer
look
at
those
red
roses
leslie
how
they
queen
it
over
everything
else
i
love
the
red
roses
said
leslie
anne
likes
the
pink
ones
best
and
gilbert
likes
the
white
but
i
want
the
crimson
ones
they
satisfy
some
craving
in
me
as
no
other
flower
does
these
roses
are
very
late
they
bloom
after
all
the
others
have
gone
and
they
hold
all
the
warmth
and
soul
of
the
summer
come
to
fruition
said
owen
plucking
some
of
the
glowing
buds
the
rose
is
the
flower
of
love
the
world
has
acclaimed
it
so
for
centuries
the
pink
roses
are
love
hopeful
and
expectant
the
white
roses
are
love
dead
or
forsaken
but
the
red
roses
ah
leslie
what
are
the
red
roses
love
triumphant
said
leslie
in
a
low
voice
yes
love
triumphant
and
perfect
leslie
you
know
you
understand
i
have
loved
you
from
the
first
and
i
know
you
love
me
i
do
need
to
ask
you
but
i
want
to
hear
you
say
it
my
darling
my
darling
leslie
said
something
in
a
very
low
and
tremulous
voice
their
hands
and
lips
met
it
was
life
supreme
moment
for
them
and
as
they
stood
there
in
the
old
garden
with
its
many
years
of
love
and
delight
and
sorrow
and
glory
he
crowned
her
shining
hair
with
the
red
red
rose
of
a
love
triumphant
anne
and
gilbert
returned
presently
accompanied
by
captain
jim
anne
lighted
a
few
sticks
of
driftwood
in
the
fireplace
for
love
of
the
pixy
flames
and
they
sat
around
it
for
an
hour
of
good
fellowship
when
i
sit
looking
at
a
driftwood
fire
it
easy
to
believe
i
young
again
said
captain
jim
can
you
read
futures
in
the
fire
captain
jim
asked
owen
captain
jim
looked
at
them
all
affectionately
and
then
back
again
at
leslie
vivid
face
and
glowing
eyes
i
do
need
the
fire
to
read
your
futures
he
said
i
see
happiness
for
all
of
you
all
of
you
for
leslie
and
ford
and
the
doctor
here
and
mistress
blythe
and
little
jem
and
children
that
ai
born
yet
but
will
be
happiness
for
you
all
though
mind
you
i
reckon
you
have
your
troubles
and
worries
and
sorrows
too
bound
to
come
and
no
house
whether
it
a
palace
or
a
little
house
of
dreams
can
bar
out
but
they
wo
get
the
better
of
you
if
you
face
together
with
love
and
trust
you
can
weather
any
storm
with
them
two
for
compass
and
pilot
the
old
man
rose
suddenly
and
placed
one
hand
on
leslie
head
and
one
on
anne
two
good
sweet
women
he
said
true
and
faithful
and
to
be
depended
on
your
husbands
will
have
honor
in
the
gates
because
of
you
your
children
will
rise
up
and
call
you
blessed
in
the
years
to
come
there
was
a
strange
solemnity
about
the
little
scene
anne
and
leslie
bowed
as
those
receiving
a
benediction
gilbert
suddenly
brushed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
owen
ford
was
rapt
as
one
who
can
see
visions
all
were
silent
for
a
space
the
little
house
of
dreams
added
another
poignant
and
unforgettable
moment
to
its
store
of
memories
i
must
be
going
now
said
captain
jim
slowly
at
last
he
took
up
his
hat
and
looked
lingeringly
about
the
room
good
night
all
of
you
he
said
as
he
went
out
anne
pierced
by
the
unusual
wistfulness
of
his
farewell
ran
to
the
door
after
him
come
back
soon
captain
jim
she
called
as
he
passed
through
the
little
gate
hung
between
the
firs
ay
ay
he
called
cheerily
back
to
her
but
captain
jim
had
sat
by
the
old
fireside
of
the
house
of
dreams
for
the
last
time
anne
went
slowly
back
to
the
others
it
so
so
pitiful
to
think
of
him
going
all
alone
down
to
that
lonely
point
she
said
and
there
is
no
one
to
welcome
him
there
captain
jim
is
such
good
company
for
others
that
one
ca
imagine
him
being
anything
but
good
company
for
himself
said
owen
but
he
must
often
be
lonely
there
was
a
touch
of
the
seer
about
him
tonight
he
spoke
as
one
to
whom
it
had
been
given
to
speak
well
i
must
be
going
too
anne
and
gilbert
discreetly
melted
away
but
when
owen
had
gone
anne
returned
to
find
leslie
standing
by
the
hearth
oh
leslie
i
know
and
i
so
glad
dear
she
said
putting
her
arms
about
her
anne
my
happiness
frightens
me
whispered
leslie
it
seems
too
great
to
be
real
i
afraid
to
speak
of
it
to
think
of
it
it
seems
to
me
that
it
must
just
be
another
dream
of
this
house
of
dreams
and
it
will
vanish
when
i
leave
here
well
you
are
not
going
to
leave
here
until
owen
takes
you
you
are
going
to
stay
with
me
until
that
times
comes
do
you
think
i
let
you
go
over
to
that
lonely
sad
place
again
thank
you
dear
i
meant
to
ask
you
if
i
might
stay
with
you
i
did
want
to
go
back
there
it
would
seem
like
going
back
into
the
chill
and
dreariness
of
the
old
life
again
anne
anne
what
a
friend
you
been
to
me
good
sweet
woman
true
and
faithful
and
to
be
depended
on
captain
jim
summed
you
up
he
said
not
smiled
anne
perhaps
captain
jim
sees
us
both
through
the
spectacles
of
his
love
for
us
but
we
can
try
to
live
up
to
his
belief
in
us
at
least
do
you
remember
anne
said
leslie
slowly
that
i
once
said
that
night
we
met
on
the
shore
that
i
hated
my
good
looks
i
did
then
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
if
i
had
been
homely
dick
would
never
have
thought
of
me
i
hated
my
beauty
because
it
had
attracted
him
but
now
oh
i
glad
that
i
have
it
it
all
i
have
to
offer
owen
his
artist
soul
delights
in
it
i
feel
as
if
i
do
not
come
to
him
quite
owen
loves
your
beauty
leslie
who
would
not
but
it
foolish
of
you
to
say
or
think
that
that
is
all
you
bring
him
he
will
tell
you
that
i
need
and
now
i
must
lock
up
i
expected
susan
back
tonight
but
she
has
not
come
oh
yes
here
i
am
mrs
doctor
dear
said
susan
entering
unexpectedly
from
the
kitchen
and
puffing
like
a
hen
drawing
rails
at
that
it
quite
a
walk
from
the
glen
down
here
i
glad
to
see
you
back
susan
how
is
your
sister
she
is
able
to
sit
up
but
of
course
she
can
not
walk
yet
however
she
is
very
well
able
to
get
on
without
me
now
for
her
daughter
has
come
home
for
her
vacation
and
i
am
thankful
to
be
back
mrs
doctor
dear
matilda
leg
was
broken
and
no
mistake
but
her
tongue
was
not
she
would
talk
the
legs
off
an
iron
pot
that
she
would
mrs
doctor
dear
though
i
grieve
to
say
it
of
my
own
sister
she
was
always
a
great
talker
and
yet
she
was
the
first
of
our
family
to
get
married
she
really
did
not
care
much
about
marrying
james
clow
but
she
could
not
bear
to
disoblige
him
not
but
what
james
is
a
good
man
the
only
fault
i
have
to
find
with
him
is
that
he
always
starts
in
to
say
grace
with
such
an
unearthly
groan
mrs
doctor
dear
it
always
frightens
my
appetite
clear
away
and
speaking
of
getting
married
mrs
doctor
dear
is
it
true
that
cornelia
bryant
is
going
to
be
married
to
marshall
elliott
yes
quite
true
susan
well
mrs
doctor
dear
it
does
not
seem
to
me
fair
here
is
me
who
never
said
a
word
against
the
men
and
i
can
not
get
married
nohow
and
there
is
cornelia
bryant
who
is
never
done
abusing
them
and
all
she
has
to
do
is
to
reach
out
her
hand
and
pick
one
up
as
it
were
it
is
a
very
strange
world
mrs
doctor
dear
there
another
world
you
know
susan
yes
said
susan
with
a
heavy
sigh
but
mrs
doctor
dear
there
is
neither
marrying
nor
giving
in
marriage
there
chapter
captain
jim
crosses
the
bar
one
day
in
late
september
owen
ford
book
came
at
last
captain
jim
had
gone
faithfully
to
the
glen
post
office
every
day
for
a
month
expecting
it
this
day
he
had
not
gone
and
leslie
brought
his
copy
home
with
hers
and
anne
we
take
it
down
to
him
this
evening
said
anne
excited
as
a
schoolgirl
the
long
walk
to
the
point
on
that
clear
beguiling
evening
along
the
red
harbor
road
was
very
pleasant
then
the
sun
dropped
down
behind
the
western
hills
into
some
valley
that
must
have
been
full
of
lost
sunsets
and
at
the
same
instant
the
big
light
flashed
out
on
the
white
tower
of
the
point
captain
jim
is
never
late
by
the
fraction
of
a
second
said
leslie
neither
anne
nor
leslie
ever
forgot
captain
jim
face
when
they
gave
him
the
book
his
book
transfigured
and
glorified
the
cheeks
that
had
been
blanched
of
late
suddenly
flamed
with
the
color
of
boyhood
his
eyes
glowed
with
all
the
fire
of
youth
but
his
hands
trembled
as
he
opened
it
it
was
called
simply
the
of
captain
jim
and
on
the
title
page
the
names
of
owen
ford
and
james
boyd
were
printed
as
collaborators
the
frontispiece
was
a
photograph
of
captain
jim
himself
standing
at
the
door
of
the
lighthouse
looking
across
the
gulf
owen
ford
had
snapped
him
one
day
while
the
book
was
being
written
captain
jim
had
known
this
but
he
had
not
known
that
the
picture
was
to
be
in
the
book
just
think
of
it
he
said
the
old
sailor
right
there
in
a
real
printed
book
this
is
the
proudest
day
of
my
life
i
like
to
bust
girls
there
be
no
sleep
for
me
tonight
i
read
my
book
clean
through
before
we
go
right
away
and
leave
you
free
to
begin
it
said
anne
captain
jim
had
been
handling
the
book
in
a
kind
of
reverent
rapture
now
he
decidedly
closed
it
and
laid
it
aside
no
no
you
not
going
away
before
you
take
a
cup
of
tea
with
the
old
man
he
protested
i
could
hear
to
that
could
you
matey
the
will
keep
i
reckon
i
waited
for
it
this
many
a
year
i
can
wait
a
little
longer
while
i
enjoying
my
friends
captain
jim
moved
about
getting
his
kettle
on
to
boil
and
setting
out
his
bread
and
butter
despite
his
excitement
he
did
not
move
with
his
old
briskness
his
movements
were
slow
and
halting
but
the
girls
did
not
offer
to
help
him
they
knew
it
would
hurt
his
feelings
you
just
picked
the
right
evening
to
visit
me
he
said
producing
a
cake
from
his
cupboard
leetle
joe
mother
sent
me
down
a
big
basket
full
of
cakes
and
pies
today
a
blessing
on
all
good
cooks
says
i
look
at
this
purty
cake
all
frosting
and
nuts
often
i
can
entertain
in
such
style
set
in
girls
set
in
we
a
cup
kindness
yet
for
auld
lang
syne
the
girls
set
in
right
merrily
the
tea
was
up
to
captain
jim
best
brewing
little
joe
mother
cake
was
the
last
word
in
cakes
captain
jim
was
the
prince
of
gracious
hosts
never
even
permitting
his
eyes
to
wander
to
the
corner
where
the
lay
in
all
its
bravery
of
green
and
gold
but
when
his
door
finally
closed
behind
anne
and
leslie
they
knew
that
he
went
straight
to
it
and
as
they
walked
home
they
pictured
the
delight
of
the
old
man
poring
over
the
printed
pages
wherein
his
own
life
was
portrayed
with
all
the
charm
and
color
of
reality
itself
i
wonder
how
he
will
like
the
ending
the
ending
i
suggested
said
leslie
she
was
never
to
know
early
the
next
morning
anne
awakened
to
find
gilbert
bending
over
her
fully
dressed
and
with
an
expression
of
anxiety
on
his
face
are
you
called
out
she
asked
drowsily
no
anne
i
afraid
there
something
wrong
at
the
point
it
an
hour
after
sunrise
now
and
the
light
is
still
burning
you
know
it
has
always
been
a
matter
of
pride
with
captain
jim
to
start
the
light
the
moment
the
sun
sets
and
put
it
out
the
moment
it
rises
anne
sat
up
in
dismay
through
her
window
she
saw
the
light
blinking
palely
against
the
blue
skies
of
dawn
perhaps
he
has
fallen
asleep
over
his
she
said
anxiously
or
become
so
absorbed
in
it
that
he
has
forgotten
the
light
gilbert
shook
his
head
that
would
be
like
captain
jim
anyway
i
going
down
to
see
wait
a
minute
and
i
go
with
you
exclaimed
anne
oh
yes
i
must
little
jem
will
sleep
for
an
hour
yet
and
i
call
susan
you
may
need
a
woman
help
if
captain
jim
is
it
was
an
exquisite
morning
full
of
tints
and
sounds
at
once
ripe
and
delicate
the
harbor
was
sparkling
and
dimpling
like
a
girl
white
gulls
were
soaring
over
the
dunes
beyond
the
bar
was
a
shining
wonderful
sea
the
long
fields
by
the
shore
were
dewy
and
fresh
in
that
first
fine
light
the
wind
came
dancing
and
whistling
up
the
channel
to
replace
the
beautiful
silence
with
a
music
more
beautiful
still
had
it
not
been
for
the
baleful
star
on
the
white
tower
that
early
walk
would
have
been
a
delight
to
anne
and
gilbert
but
they
went
softly
with
fear
their
knock
was
not
responded
to
gilbert
opened
the
door
and
they
went
in
the
old
room
was
very
quiet
on
the
table
were
the
remnants
of
the
little
evening
feast
the
lamp
still
burned
on
the
corner
stand
the
first
mate
was
asleep
in
a
square
of
sunshine
by
the
sofa
captain
jim
lay
on
the
sofa
with
his
hands
clasped
over
the
open
at
the
last
page
lying
on
his
breast
his
eyes
were
closed
and
on
his
face
was
a
look
of
the
most
perfect
peace
and
happiness
the
look
of
one
who
has
long
sought
and
found
at
last
he
is
asleep
whispered
anne
tremulously
gilbert
went
to
the
sofa
and
bent
over
him
for
a
few
moments
then
he
straightened
up
yes
he
sleeps
well
he
added
quietly
anne
captain
jim
has
crossed
the
bar
they
could
not
know
precisely
at
what
hour
he
had
died
but
anne
always
believed
that
he
had
had
his
wish
and
went
out
when
the
morning
came
across
the
gulf
out
on
that
shining
tide
his
spirit
drifted
over
the
sunrise
sea
of
pearl
and
silver
to
the
haven
where
lost
margaret
waited
beyond
the
storms
and
calms
chapter
farewell
to
the
house
of
dreams
captain
jim
was
buried
in
the
little
graveyard
very
near
to
the
spot
where
the
wee
white
lady
slept
his
relatives
put
up
a
very
expensive
very
ugly
monument
a
monument
at
which
he
would
have
poked
sly
fun
had
he
seen
it
in
life
but
his
real
monument
was
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
knew
him
and
in
the
book
that
was
to
live
for
generations
leslie
mourned
that
captain
jim
had
not
lived
to
see
the
amazing
success
of
it
how
he
would
have
delighted
in
the
reviews
they
are
almost
all
so
kindly
and
to
have
seen
his
heading
the
lists
of
the
best
sellers
oh
if
he
could
just
have
lived
to
see
it
anne
but
anne
despite
her
grief
was
wiser
it
was
the
book
itself
he
cared
for
leslie
not
what
might
be
said
of
it
and
he
had
it
he
had
read
it
all
through
that
last
night
must
have
been
one
of
the
greatest
happiness
for
him
with
the
quick
painless
ending
he
had
hoped
for
in
the
morning
i
am
glad
for
sake
and
yours
that
the
book
is
such
a
success
but
captain
jim
was
satisfied
i
know
the
lighthouse
star
still
kept
a
nightly
vigil
a
substitute
keeper
had
been
sent
to
the
point
until
such
time
as
an
government
could
decide
which
of
many
applicants
was
best
fitted
for
the
place
or
had
the
strongest
pull
the
first
mate
was
at
home
in
the
little
house
beloved
by
anne
and
gilbert
and
leslie
and
tolerated
by
a
susan
who
had
small
liking
for
cats
i
can
put
up
with
him
for
the
sake
of
captain
jim
mrs
doctor
dear
for
i
liked
the
old
man
and
i
will
see
that
he
gets
bite
and
sup
and
every
mouse
the
traps
account
for
but
do
not
ask
me
to
do
more
than
that
mrs
doctor
dear
cats
is
cats
and
take
my
word
for
it
they
will
never
be
anything
else
and
at
least
mrs
doctor
dear
do
keep
him
away
from
the
blessed
wee
man
picture
to
yourself
how
awful
it
would
be
if
he
was
to
suck
the
darling
breath
that
might
be
fitly
called
a
said
gilbert
oh
you
may
laugh
doctor
dear
but
it
would
be
no
laughing
matter
cats
never
suck
babies
breaths
said
gilbert
that
is
only
an
old
superstition
susan
oh
well
it
may
be
a
superstition
or
it
may
not
doctor
dear
all
that
i
know
is
it
has
happened
my
sister
husband
nephew
cat
sucked
their
baby
breath
and
the
poor
innocent
was
all
but
gone
when
they
found
it
and
superstition
or
not
if
i
find
that
yellow
beast
lurking
near
our
baby
i
will
whack
him
with
the
poker
mrs
doctor
dear
and
marshall
elliott
were
living
comfortably
and
harmoniously
in
the
green
house
leslie
was
busy
with
sewing
for
she
and
owen
were
to
be
married
at
christmas
anne
wondered
what
she
would
do
when
leslie
was
gone
changes
come
all
the
time
just
as
soon
as
things
get
really
nice
they
change
she
said
with
a
sigh
the
old
morgan
place
up
at
the
glen
is
for
sale
said
gilbert
apropos
of
nothing
in
especial
is
it
asked
anne
indifferently
yes
now
that
morgan
has
gone
morgan
wants
to
go
to
live
with
her
children
in
vancouver
she
will
sell
cheaply
for
a
big
place
like
that
in
a
small
village
like
the
glen
will
not
be
very
easy
to
dispose
of
well
it
certainly
a
beautiful
place
so
it
is
likely
she
will
find
a
purchaser
said
anne
absently
wondering
whether
she
should
hemstitch
or
little
jem
short
dresses
he
was
to
be
shortened
the
next
week
and
anne
felt
ready
to
cry
at
the
thought
of
it
suppose
we
buy
it
anne
remarked
gilbert
quietly
anne
dropped
her
sewing
and
stared
at
him
you
not
in
earnest
gilbert
indeed
i
am
dear
and
leave
this
darling
spot
our
house
of
dreams
said
anne
incredulously
oh
gilbert
it
it
unthinkable
listen
patiently
to
me
dear
i
know
just
how
you
feel
about
it
i
feel
the
same
but
we
always
known
we
would
have
to
move
some
day
oh
but
not
so
soon
gilbert
not
just
yet
we
may
never
get
such
a
chance
again
if
we
do
buy
the
morgan
place
someone
else
will
and
there
is
no
other
house
in
the
glen
we
would
care
to
have
and
no
other
really
good
site
on
which
to
build
this
little
house
is
well
it
is
and
has
been
what
no
other
house
can
ever
be
to
us
i
admit
but
you
know
it
is
down
here
for
a
doctor
we
have
felt
the
inconvenience
though
we
made
the
best
of
it
and
it
a
tight
fit
for
us
now
perhaps
in
a
few
years
when
jem
wants
a
room
of
his
own
it
will
be
entirely
too
small
oh
i
know
i
know
said
anne
tears
filling
her
eyes
i
know
all
that
can
be
said
against
it
but
i
love
it
so
and
it
so
beautiful
here
you
would
find
it
very
lonely
here
after
leslie
goes
and
captain
jim
has
gone
too
the
morgan
place
is
beautiful
and
in
time
we
would
love
it
you
know
you
have
always
admired
it
anne
oh
yes
but
but
this
has
all
seemed
to
come
up
so
suddenly
gilbert
i
dizzy
ten
minutes
ago
i
had
no
thought
of
leaving
this
dear
spot
i
was
planning
what
i
meant
to
do
for
it
in
the
spring
what
i
meant
to
do
in
the
garden
and
if
we
leave
this
place
who
will
get
it
it
is
so
it
likely
some
poor
shiftless
wandering
family
will
rent
it
and
it
and
oh
that
would
be
desecration
it
would
hurt
me
horribly
i
know
but
we
can
not
sacrifice
our
own
interests
to
such
considerations
the
morgan
place
will
suit
us
in
every
essential
particular
we
really
ca
afford
to
miss
such
a
chance
think
of
that
big
lawn
with
those
magnificent
old
trees
and
of
that
splendid
hardwood
grove
behind
it
twelve
acres
of
it
what
a
play
place
for
our
children
there
a
fine
orchard
too
and
you
always
admired
that
high
brick
wall
around
the
garden
with
the
door
in
it
you
thought
it
was
so
like
a
garden
and
there
is
almost
as
fine
a
view
of
the
harbor
and
the
dunes
from
the
morgan
place
as
from
here
you
ca
see
the
lighthouse
star
from
it
yes
you
can
see
it
from
the
attic
window
there
another
advantage
you
love
big
garrets
there
no
brook
in
the
garden
well
no
but
there
is
one
running
through
the
maple
grove
into
the
glen
pond
and
the
pond
itself
is
far
away
you
be
able
to
fancy
you
have
your
own
lake
of
shining
waters
again
well
do
say
anything
more
about
it
just
now
gilbert
give
me
time
to
think
to
get
used
to
the
idea
all
right
there
is
no
great
hurry
of
course
only
if
we
decide
to
buy
it
would
be
well
to
be
moved
in
and
settled
before
winter
gilbert
went
out
and
anne
put
away
little
jem
short
dresses
with
trembling
hands
she
could
not
sew
any
more
that
day
with
eyes
she
wandered
over
the
little
domain
where
she
had
reigned
so
happy
a
queen
the
morgan
place
was
all
that
gilbert
claimed
the
grounds
were
beautiful
the
house
old
enough
to
have
dignity
and
repose
and
traditions
and
new
enough
to
be
comfortable
and
anne
had
always
admired
it
but
admiring
is
not
loving
and
she
loved
this
house
of
dreams
so
much
she
loved
everything
about
it
the
garden
she
had
tended
and
which
so
many
women
had
tended
before
her
the
gleam
and
sparkle
of
the
little
brook
that
crept
so
roguishly
across
the
corner
the
gate
between
the
creaking
fir
trees
the
old
red
sandstone
step
the
stately
lombardies
the
two
tiny
quaint
glass
cupboards
over
the
in
the
the
crooked
pantry
door
in
the
kitchen
the
two
funny
dormer
windows
upstairs
the
little
jog
in
the
staircase
why
these
things
were
a
part
of
her
how
could
she
leave
them
and
how
this
little
house
consecrated
aforetime
by
love
and
joy
had
been
for
her
by
her
happiness
and
sorrow
here
she
had
spent
her
bridal
moon
here
wee
joyce
had
lived
her
one
brief
day
here
the
sweetness
of
motherhood
had
come
again
with
little
jem
here
she
had
heard
the
exquisite
music
of
her
baby
cooing
laughter
here
beloved
friends
had
sat
by
her
fireside
joy
and
grief
birth
and
death
had
made
sacred
forever
this
little
house
of
dreams
and
now
she
must
leave
it
she
knew
that
even
while
she
had
contended
against
the
idea
to
gilbert
the
little
house
was
outgrown
interests
made
the
change
necessary
his
work
successful
though
it
had
been
was
hampered
by
his
location
anne
realised
that
the
end
of
their
life
in
this
dear
place
drew
nigh
and
that
she
must
face
the
fact
bravely
but
how
her
heart
ached
it
will
be
just
like
tearing
something
out
of
my
life
she
sobbed
and
oh
if
i
could
hope
that
some
nice
folk
would
come
here
in
our
place
or
even
that
it
would
be
left
vacant
that
itself
would
be
better
than
having
it
overrun
with
some
horde
who
know
nothing
of
the
geography
of
dreamland
and
nothing
of
the
history
that
has
given
this
house
its
soul
and
its
identity
and
if
such
a
tribe
come
here
the
place
will
go
to
rack
and
ruin
in
no
time
an
old
place
goes
down
so
quickly
if
it
is
not
carefully
attended
to
they
tear
up
my
garden
and
let
the
lombardies
get
ragged
and
the
paling
will
come
to
look
like
a
mouth
with
half
the
teeth
missing
and
the
roof
will
leak
and
the
plaster
fall
and
they
stuff
pillows
and
rags
in
broken
window
panes
and
everything
will
be
anne
imagination
pictured
forth
so
vividly
the
coming
degeneration
of
her
dear
little
house
that
it
hurt
her
as
severely
as
if
it
had
already
been
an
accomplished
fact
she
sat
down
on
the
stairs
and
had
a
long
bitter
cry
susan
found
her
there
and
enquired
with
much
concern
what
the
trouble
was
you
have
not
quarrelled
with
the
doctor
have
you
now
mrs
doctor
dear
but
if
you
have
do
not
worry
it
is
a
thing
quite
likely
to
happen
to
married
couples
i
am
told
although
i
have
had
no
experience
that
way
myself
he
will
be
sorry
and
you
can
soon
make
it
up
no
no
susan
we
have
quarrelled
it
only
gilbert
is
going
to
buy
the
morgan
place
and
we
have
to
go
and
live
at
the
glen
and
it
will
break
my
heart
susan
did
not
enter
into
anne
feelings
at
all
she
was
indeed
quite
rejoiced
over
the
prospect
of
living
at
the
glen
her
one
grievance
against
her
place
in
the
little
house
was
its
lonesome
location
why
mrs
doctor
dear
it
will
be
splendid
the
morgan
house
is
such
a
fine
big
one
i
hate
big
houses
sobbed
anne
oh
well
you
will
not
hate
them
by
the
time
you
have
half
a
dozen
children
remarked
susan
calmly
and
this
house
is
too
small
already
for
us
we
have
no
spare
room
since
moore
is
here
and
that
pantry
is
the
most
aggravating
place
i
ever
tried
to
work
in
there
is
a
corner
every
way
you
turn
besides
it
is
down
here
there
is
really
nothing
at
all
but
scenery
out
of
your
world
perhaps
susan
but
not
out
of
mine
said
anne
with
a
faint
smile
i
do
not
quite
understand
you
mrs
doctor
dear
but
of
course
i
am
not
well
educated
but
if
blythe
buys
the
morgan
place
he
will
make
no
mistake
and
that
you
may
tie
to
they
have
water
in
it
and
the
pantries
and
closets
are
beautiful
and
there
is
not
another
such
cellar
in
island
so
i
have
been
told
why
the
cellar
here
mrs
doctor
dear
has
been
a
to
me
as
well
you
know
oh
go
away
susan
go
away
said
anne
forlornly
cellars
and
pantries
and
closets
do
make
a
home
why
do
you
weep
with
those
who
weep
well
i
never
was
much
hand
for
weeping
mrs
doctor
dear
i
would
rather
fall
to
and
cheer
people
up
than
weep
with
them
now
do
not
you
cry
and
spoil
your
pretty
eyes
this
house
is
very
well
and
has
served
your
turn
but
it
is
high
time
you
had
a
better
susan
point
of
view
seemed
to
be
that
of
most
people
leslie
was
the
only
one
who
sympathised
understandingly
with
anne
she
had
a
good
cry
too
when
she
heard
the
news
then
they
both
dried
their
tears
and
went
to
work
at
the
preparations
for
moving
since
we
must
go
let
us
go
as
soon
as
we
can
and
have
it
over
said
poor
anne
with
bitter
resignation
you
know
you
will
like
that
lovely
old
place
at
the
glen
after
you
have
lived
in
it
long
enough
to
have
dear
memories
woven
about
it
said
leslie
friends
will
come
there
as
they
have
come
here
happiness
will
glorify
it
for
you
now
it
just
a
house
to
you
but
the
years
will
make
it
a
home
anne
and
leslie
had
another
cry
the
next
week
when
they
shortened
little
jem
anne
felt
the
tragedy
of
it
until
evening
when
in
his
long
nightie
she
found
her
own
dear
baby
again
but
it
will
be
rompers
next
and
then
trousers
and
in
no
time
he
will
be
she
sighed
well
you
would
not
want
him
to
stay
a
baby
always
mrs
doctor
dear
would
you
said
susan
bless
his
innocent
heart
he
looks
too
sweet
for
anything
in
his
little
short
dresses
with
his
dear
feet
sticking
out
and
think
of
the
save
in
the
ironing
mrs
doctor
dear
anne
i
have
just
had
a
letter
from
owen
said
leslie
entering
with
a
bright
face
and
oh
i
have
such
good
news
he
writes
me
that
he
is
going
to
buy
this
place
from
the
church
trustees
and
keep
it
to
spend
our
summer
vacations
in
anne
are
you
not
glad
oh
leslie
is
the
word
for
it
it
seems
almost
too
good
to
be
true
i
feel
half
so
badly
now
that
i
know
this
dear
spot
will
never
be
desecrated
by
a
vandal
tribe
or
left
to
tumble
down
in
decay
why
it
lovely
it
lovely
one
october
morning
anne
wakened
to
the
realisation
that
she
had
slept
for
the
last
time
under
the
roof
of
her
little
house
the
day
was
too
busy
to
indulge
regret
and
when
evening
came
the
house
was
stripped
and
bare
anne
and
gilbert
were
alone
in
it
to
say
farewell
leslie
and
susan
and
little
jem
had
gone
to
the
glen
with
the
last
load
of
furniture
the
sunset
light
streamed
in
through
the
curtainless
windows
it
has
all
such
a
reproachful
look
has
it
said
anne
oh
i
shall
be
so
homesick
at
the
glen
tonight
we
have
been
very
happy
here
have
we
said
gilbert
his
voice
full
of
feeling
anne
choked
unable
to
answer
gilbert
waited
for
her
at
the
gate
while
she
went
over
the
house
and
said
farewell
to
every
room
she
was
going
away
but
the
old
house
would
still
be
there
looking
seaward
through
its
quaint
windows
the
autumn
winds
would
blow
around
it
mournfully
and
the
gray
rain
would
beat
upon
it
and
the
white
mists
would
come
in
from
the
sea
to
enfold
it
and
the
moonlight
would
fall
over
it
and
light
up
the
old
paths
where
the
schoolmaster
and
his
bride
had
walked
there
on
that
old
harbor
shore
the
charm
of
story
would
linger
the
wind
would
still
whistle
alluringly
over
the
silver
the
waves
would
still
call
from
the
red
but
we
will
be
gone
said
anne
through
her
tears
she
went
out
closing
and
locking
the
door
behind
her
gilbert
was
waiting
for
her
with
a
smile
the
lighthouse
star
was
gleaming
northward
the
little
garden
where
only
marigolds
still
bloomed
was
already
hooding
itself
in
shadows
anne
knelt
down
and
kissed
the
worn
old
step
which
she
had
crossed
as
a
bride
dear
little
house
of
dreams
she
said
