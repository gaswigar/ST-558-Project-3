chapter
i
the
first
step
austin
the
butler
gave
his
evidence
in
a
straightforward
fashion
he
was
a
man
slightly
below
middle
height
inclined
to
portliness
but
bore
himself
with
the
dignity
of
one
who
had
been
likened
to
an
archbishop
although
he
had
been
examined
by
a
number
of
minor
officials
hectored
by
them
threatened
or
cajoled
as
they
interpreted
their
duty
his
testimony
remained
the
same
and
when
he
hoped
this
tedious
business
was
all
over
he
was
brought
before
inspector
mcwalsh
and
compelled
to
begin
all
over
again
it
was
mcwalsh
s
theory
that
a
man
may
be
startled
into
telling
the
truth
that
will
convict
him
he
had
a
habit
of
leaning
forward
chin
thrust
out
great
fists
clenched
and
hurling
accusations
at
suspects
he
disliked
austin
at
sight
the
feeling
was
not
wholly
of
national
origin
mcwalsh
liked
witnesses
no
less
than
criminals
to
exhibit
some
indications
of
the
terrors
his
name
had
inspired
to
the
guilty
austin
gazed
about
him
as
though
the
surroundings
were
not
to
his
taste
his
attitude
was
one
of
deferential
boredom
he
recognized
the
inspector
as
one
representing
justly
constituted
authority
to
be
accepted
with
respect
in
everything
but
a
social
sense
inspector
mcwalsh
permitted
himself
to
make
jocose
remarks
as
to
austin
s
personal
appearance
mcwalsh
passed
for
a
wit
among
his
inferiors
at
half
past
twelve
on
tuesday
i
came
into
the
library
the
butler
repeated
patiently
and
asked
warren
if
he
wanted
anything
before
i
went
to
what
did
he
say
demanded
the
inspector
that
he
did
not
want
anything
and
that
i
could
go
to
and
you
did
naturally
the
butler
returned
what
duties
have
you
the
last
thing
before
retiring
i
see
that
the
doors
and
windows
are
the
inspector
sneered
the
small
black
eyes
set
in
his
heavy
red
face
regarded
the
smaller
man
malevolently
and
you
did
it
so
damn
well
that
within
an
hour
or
so
ten
thousand
dollars
worth
of
valuables
was
walked
off
with
by
a
crook
how
do
you
account
for
that
i
don
t
try
to
the
butler
answered
suavely
that
s
for
you
gentlemen
of
the
police
i
have
my
duties
and
i
attend
to
them
as
my
testimonials
show
i
don
t
presume
to
give
you
advice
but
i
should
say
it
was
because
the
crook
was
cleverer
than
your
don
t
get
funny
snapped
mcwalsh
he
had
on
the
table
before
him
austin
s
modest
life
history
which
consisted
mainly
in
terms
of
service
to
wealthy
families
in
england
and
the
united
states
these
proved
him
to
be
efficient
and
trustworthy
i
want
answers
to
my
questions
and
not
comments
from
austin
s
manner
nettled
him
it
was
that
slightly
superior
air
the
servants
mark
of
contempt
and
never
before
had
the
inspector
been
referred
to
as
a
gentleman
of
the
police
he
suspected
a
slight
let
s
get
this
thing
straight
he
went
on
you
went
to
bed
when
your
services
were
no
longer
required
your
employer
said
to
you
you
can
go
to
bed
austin
i
don
t
want
anything
so
you
locked
up
and
retired
you
didn
t
know
anything
about
the
burglary
until
half
past
six
o
clock
on
wednesday
morning
this
morning
you
aroused
your
employer
who
sent
for
the
police
that
s
correct
absolutely
austin
returned
he
was
plainly
not
much
interested
and
you
still
stick
to
it
that
warren
made
that
remark
austin
looked
at
the
inspector
quickly
his
bored
manner
was
gone
yes
he
said
deliberately
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
those
were
his
words
i
may
have
made
a
mistake
in
the
phrasing
but
that
is
what
he
what
s
the
good
of
your
coming
here
and
lying
to
me
the
inspector
spoke
in
an
aggrieved
tone
i
was
brought
here
against
my
will
austin
reminded
him
and
i
have
not
lied
although
your
manner
has
been
most
offensive
you
see
sir
i
m
accustomed
to
mcwalsh
motioned
him
to
be
silent
that
ll
do
he
commanded
i
m
not
interested
in
what
you
think
now
answer
this
carefully
what
clothes
was
warren
wearing
evening
dress
said
the
butler
but
a
velvet
smoking
jacket
instead
of
a
black
how
was
he
looking
do
you
mean
in
what
direction
you
know
i
don
t
i
mean
was
he
looking
as
usual
was
there
anything
unusual
in
his
look
nothing
that
i
noticed
austin
told
him
but
then
his
back
was
to
me
so
i
am
not
competent
to
when
you
speak
to
any
one
don
t
you
go
up
and
look
em
in
the
face
like
a
man
same
as
i
m
talking
and
looking
at
you
austin
permitted
himself
to
smile
do
you
suggest
i
should
look
at
warren
as
you
are
looking
at
me
pardon
me
sir
but
i
should
lose
my
place
if
i
mcwalsh
flushed
a
darker
red
why
didn
t
you
look
at
him
in
your
own
way
then
it
s
very
clear
austin
answered
with
dignity
that
you
know
very
little
of
the
ways
of
an
establishment
like
ours
i
stood
at
the
door
as
i
usually
do
asked
a
question
i
have
done
hundreds
of
times
and
received
the
same
answer
i
do
as
a
rule
if
i
d
known
i
was
to
have
to
answer
all
these
questions
i
might
have
recollected
more
about
what
was
warren
doing
reading
a
paper
and
he
was
alone
and
all
the
other
servants
had
gone
to
bed
you
heard
no
unusual
sounds
that
night
if
i
had
i
should
have
investigated
no
doubt
sneered
the
other
you
look
like
a
man
who
would
enjoy
running
into
a
crook
with
a
i
should
not
enjoy
it
austin
returned
seriously
inspector
mcwalsh
beckoned
to
one
of
his
inferiors
keep
this
man
outside
till
i
send
for
him
and
see
he
don
t
speak
to
his
boss
who
s
waiting
send
warren
right
conington
warren
one
of
the
most
popular
men
in
society
member
of
the
desirable
clubs
millionaire
owner
of
thoroughbreds
came
briskly
in
he
was
now
about
fifty
handsome
still
but
his
florid
face
was
marked
by
the
convivial
years
inspector
mcwalsh
had
long
followed
the
warren
colors
famous
on
the
big
race
courses
his
manner
showed
his
respect
for
the
owner
of
his
favorite
stable
i
asked
you
to
come
here
he
began
because
you
told
my
secretary
over
the
phone
that
you
had
some
new
light
on
this
burglary
so
far
it
seems
just
an
ordinary
case
without
any
unusual
it
s
not
as
ordinary
as
you
think
said
conington
warren
he
offered
mcwalsh
one
of
his
famous
cigars
incidentally
it
does
not
show
me
up
very
favorably
as
i
m
bound
to
mcwalsh
regarded
his
cigar
reverently
warren
smoked
nothing
but
these
superb
things
what
a
man
what
a
man
i
can
t
believe
that
warren
he
returned
are
you
interested
in
the
thoroughbreds
mcwalsh
am
i
cried
the
other
enthusiastically
why
when
i
couldn
t
spend
a
few
hours
at
old
sheepshead
bay
i
nearly
resigned
why
warren
i
made
enough
on
conington
when
he
won
the
brooklyn
handicap
to
pay
the
mortgage
off
on
my
home
then
you
ll
understand
the
sportsman
said
graciously
it
s
like
this
last
year
i
bought
a
number
of
yearlings
at
the
newmarket
sales
in
england
there
s
one
of
them
a
chestnut
colt
named
saint
beau
who
did
a
most
remarkable
trial
a
day
or
two
since
in
confidence
inspector
it
was
better
than
conington
s
best
make
a
note
of
that
but
keep
it
under
your
i
surely
will
sir
cried
the
ecstatic
mcwalsh
when
i
heard
the
time
of
the
trial
i
gave
a
little
dinner
to
a
number
of
good
pals
at
voisin
the
names
he
mentioned
were
all
of
them
prominently
known
in
the
fashionable
world
of
sport
we
had
more
champagne
than
was
good
for
us
and
when
the
dinner
was
over
we
all
went
to
reggie
camplyn
s
rooms
where
he
invented
the
saint
beau
cocktail
i
give
you
my
word
inspector
the
thing
has
a
thoro
bred
kick
to
it
it
s
one
of
those
damned
insidious
cocktails
wrapped
up
in
cream
to
make
you
think
it
s
innocent
after
i
d
had
a
few
i
said
to
camplyn
you
ve
made
me
what
i
am
i
insist
on
sleeping
but
you
didn
t
cried
mcwalsh
until
four
in
the
morning
the
saint
beau
cocktail
made
me
so
ill
at
four
that
i
got
up
and
walked
down
to
my
what
time
did
you
get
there
exactly
at
five
i
felt
the
need
of
the
cool
air
so
i
took
a
long
walk
then
at
half
past
twelve
you
were
at
voisin
s
as
a
score
of
people
can
prove
i
had
a
table
in
the
balcony
and
saw
all
the
people
i
ever
knew
it
seemed
to
but
this
morning
you
told
the
officers
who
made
an
investigation
of
the
robbery
a
totally
different
story
you
corroborated
your
butler
s
evidence
that
you
were
at
home
at
half
past
twelve
and
told
him
to
go
to
bed
because
you
didn
t
want
anything
else
how
do
you
account
for
that
the
inspector
was
troubled
his
only
consolation
was
that
he
would
have
another
session
soon
with
the
supercilious
austin
he
licked
his
lips
at
the
thought
but
he
did
not
wish
to
involve
the
horseman
in
any
difficulties
if
he
could
avoid
it
conington
warren
laughed
easily
you
know
how
it
is
inspector
you
can
understand
that
sometimes
a
man
suddenly
waked
out
of
heavy
sleep
can
forget
what
happened
the
night
before
for
the
time
being
that
s
what
happened
with
me
i
clean
forgot
the
dinner
camplyn
s
saint
beau
cocktail
everything
i
only
knew
i
had
the
devil
of
a
head
i
always
rely
on
when
did
you
remember
mcwalsh
demanded
when
camplyn
came
in
to
see
me
and
ask
for
the
ingredients
of
the
cocktail
which
he
claims
i
invented
then
i
recollected
everything
and
telephoned
to
i
knew
that
damned
fellow
was
lying
mcwalsh
cried
he
thought
he
was
clever
he
ll
find
out
just
how
smart
he
is
tell
me
warren
what
did
he
want
to
put
up
that
fiction
for
warren
put
a
hot
hand
to
a
head
which
still
ached
i
can
t
imagine
he
answered
i
ve
never
found
him
out
in
a
lie
yet
he
s
too
damn
conceited
to
descend
to
one
i
don
t
think
you
should
suspect
i
m
sorry
warren
but
i
ve
got
to
he
lied
to
you
and
he
lied
to
me
and
ten
thousand
dollars
worth
of
stuff
was
stolen
he
s
in
the
outer
room
now
i
ll
have
him
brought
austin
entered
with
his
precise
and
measured
tread
and
bowed
with
respectful
affection
to
his
employer
he
liked
conington
warren
better
than
any
american
with
whom
he
had
taken
service
the
hearty
type
was
one
which
appealed
to
austin
he
had
several
times
been
obliged
to
throw
up
lucrative
jobs
because
employers
persisted
in
treating
him
as
an
equal
this
is
a
bad
his
master
began
the
inspector
seems
to
think
you
have
been
deceiving
he
has
and
he
knows
it
cried
mcwalsh
he
s
inclined
to
be
hasty
sir
said
austin
tolerantly
see
here
snapped
the
inspector
you
say
you
found
warren
in
his
library
at
half
past
twelve
did
you
hear
him
enter
the
house
no
the
butler
returned
he
has
his
the
thing
we
want
to
clear
up
interrupted
warren
in
a
kindly
tone
is
simply
this
what
did
i
say
to
you
when
you
spoke
to
me
austin
looked
uncomfortable
it
was
a
gesture
sir
rather
than
a
word
you
waved
your
arm
and
i
knew
what
you
you
are
one
prize
liar
roared
the
inspector
you
said
something
quite
different
when
i
asked
i
don
t
see
that
it
matters
much
austin
returned
acidly
on
monday
night
warren
may
have
said
for
me
to
go
to
bed
on
tuesday
he
may
have
waved
his
hand
impatient
like
on
wednesday
he
may
have
asked
for
cigars
or
the
evening
papers
i
remember
only
that
on
this
occasion
i
was
not
asked
for
he
turned
to
his
employer
i
should
like
to
remind
you
sir
that
we
are
giving
a
dinner
party
and
i
ought
to
be
seeing
after
it
now
can
i
go
sir
you
can
not
cried
inspector
mcwalsh
you
re
under
arrest
i
told
you
he
was
hasty
sir
said
austin
without
emotion
what
for
may
i
ask
let
me
answer
him
please
inspector
begged
conington
warren
you
told
the
police
that
you
saw
me
sitting
in
my
library
are
you
prepared
to
swear
to
that
austin
certainly
sir
said
the
man
you
were
in
the
big
turkish
rocker
smoking
one
of
the
cigars
you
are
smoking
now
and
reading
the
sporting
i
d
give
a
thousand
dollars
to
know
who
that
was
warren
commented
it
wasn
t
i
at
all
i
was
dining
at
voisin
s
at
that
for
the
first
time
austin
was
acutely
disturbed
i
don
t
understand
he
stammered
it
looked
like
you
sir
it
did
and
if
you
d
only
gone
up
like
a
man
and
looked
in
his
face
you
d
have
seen
the
burglar
mcwalsh
said
scowling
austin
looked
at
the
speaker
coldly
it
is
not
my
business
to
suspect
my
employer
of
being
a
crook
if
it
s
crime
to
be
deceived
then
i
m
guilty
i
admit
i
didn
t
look
very
closely
i
was
sleepy
and
wanting
to
get
to
bed
but
i
did
notice
that
whoever
it
was
wore
a
claret
colored
velvet
smoking
i
ve
a
list
here
said
mcwalsh
given
my
men
by
the
footman
of
the
people
who
called
at
warren
s
house
yesterday
look
it
over
and
see
if
you
can
supplement
there
was
one
other
visitor
austin
said
slowly
an
intimate
friend
of
warren
s
but
i
don
t
know
his
name
i
didn
t
admit
that
s
curious
said
his
employer
i
thought
you
knew
every
one
who
was
intimate
enough
to
come
to
my
home
what
was
he
like
i
didn
t
see
him
full
face
the
other
admitted
but
he
was
tall
about
your
height
but
dark
in
coloring
with
a
rather
large
nose
it
struck
me
he
was
a
trifle
in
liquor
if
i
may
say
i
don
t
remember
any
one
like
that
warren
asserted
the
gentleman
said
austin
anxious
to
establish
his
point
who
bet
you
ten
thousand
dollars
that
his
filly
could
beat
your
saint
beau
at
five
this
is
all
damned
nonsense
returned
conington
warren
a
little
crossly
i
m
in
possession
of
my
full
senses
now
at
all
events
i
made
no
such
i
told
you
he
was
a
crook
warren
cried
mcwalsh
gleefully
see
what
he
s
trying
to
put
over
on
you
now
surely
sir
said
the
butler
anxiously
you
remember
asking
a
gentleman
to
come
into
your
dressing
room
you
re
crazy
his
master
declared
i
asked
nobody
why
should
i
he
was
standing
just
inside
the
room
as
i
passed
by
he
was
very
merry
he
was
calling
you
connie
like
only
your
very
intimate
friends
and
what
was
i
saying
warren
returned
impressed
with
the
earnestness
of
one
in
whom
he
believed
i
didn
t
listen
sir
the
butler
answered
i
was
just
passing
along
the
did
you
hear
warren
s
voice
mcwalsh
demanded
suddenly
austin
reflected
i
wouldn
t
swear
to
it
he
decided
what
time
was
it
warren
asked
a
little
after
ten
said
austin
i
left
the
house
at
eight
so
you
are
not
likely
to
have
heard
me
i
was
at
voisin
s
from
half
past
eight
until
nearly
one
when
did
you
first
see
this
supposed
friend
i
was
going
up
the
main
stairway
as
he
was
about
to
come
down
toward
me
almost
directly
i
saw
him
and
i
didn
t
at
the
time
think
he
saw
me
he
turned
back
as
if
you
had
called
him
from
your
room
he
said
what
is
it
connie
then
he
walked
down
the
corridor
and
stood
half
way
in
your
room
talking
to
you
as
i
supposed
he
looked
like
a
gentleman
who
might
belong
to
your
clubs
sir
and
spoke
like
one
what
was
i
to
think
i
m
not
blaming
you
said
conington
warren
i
m
as
puzzled
as
you
are
didn
t
yogotama
see
him
when
he
went
to
my
room
to
get
my
smoking
jacket
which
you
say
he
wore
what
was
yogotama
doing
to
allow
that
sort
of
thing
you
forget
sir
explained
austin
that
yogotama
wasn
t
why
wasn
t
he
directly
he
got
your
note
he
went
off
to
the
this
gets
worse
and
worse
warren
asserted
i
sent
him
no
he
got
one
in
your
writing
apparently
written
on
the
stationery
of
the
knickerbocker
club
i
saw
it
you
told
him
to
go
instantly
to
your
camp
and
prepare
it
for
immediate
occupancy
he
was
to
take
evans
and
one
of
the
touring
cars
he
got
the
note
about
half
past
just
after
you
d
left
the
house
mcwalsh
commented
it
didn
t
take
yogotama
a
half
hour
to
prepare
added
austin
what
do
you
make
of
it
inspector
warren
demanded
a
clever
crook
that
s
all
said
the
other
but
he
can
t
pull
anything
like
that
in
this
town
and
get
away
with
austin
made
a
polite
gesture
implying
doubt
it
incensed
the
official
you
don
t
think
so
eh
not
from
what
i
ve
seen
of
your
methods
i
ve
no
doubt
you
can
deal
with
the
common
ruck
of
criminals
but
this
man
is
different
it
may
be
easy
enough
for
a
man
to
deceive
you
people
by
pretending
to
be
a
gentleman
but
we
can
see
through
them
frankly
said
austin
growing
bolder
i
don
t
think
you
gentlemen
of
the
police
have
the
native
wit
for
the
higher
kind
of
warren
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
this
was
a
new
and
rebellious
austin
a
man
chafing
under
a
personal
grievance
a
belligerent
butler
you
mustn
t
speak
like
that
to
inspector
mcwalsh
he
commanded
he
is
doing
his
that
may
be
sir
austin
remarked
but
how
would
you
like
to
be
called
little
lancelot
from
lunnon
you
look
it
mcwalsh
said
roughly
anyway
i
ve
no
time
to
argue
with
house
servants
what
you
ve
got
to
do
is
to
look
through
our
collection
of
pictures
and
see
if
you
can
identify
any
of
em
with
the
man
you
say
you
austin
surveyed
the
faces
with
open
aversion
he
s
not
here
said
austin
decisively
he
was
not
this
criminal
type
at
all
i
tell
you
i
mistook
him
for
a
member
of
warren
s
clubs
the
kind
of
gentleman
who
dines
at
the
house
these
and
he
pointed
derisively
to
the
pillories
of
crime
you
wouldn
t
be
likely
to
see
any
of
these
at
our
house
they
are
just
mcwalsh
sneered
i
see
look
more
like
policemen
i
suppose
austin
smiled
blandly
the
very
thing
that
was
in
my
chapter
ii
anthony
trent
talks
on
crime
anthony
trentwas
working
his
typewriter
at
top
speed
when
there
came
a
sudden
peremptory
knocking
at
his
door
lord
he
grumbled
rising
it
must
be
old
lund
to
say
i
m
keeping
him
he
threw
open
his
door
to
find
a
small
choleric
and
elderly
man
clad
in
a
faded
dressing
gown
it
was
a
man
with
a
just
grievance
and
a
desire
to
express
it
this
is
no
time
to
hammer
on
your
typewriter
said
lund
fiercely
this
is
a
boarding
house
and
not
a
private
residence
do
you
realize
that
you
generally
begin
work
at
midnight
come
in
said
anthony
trent
genially
with
friendly
force
he
dragged
the
smaller
man
along
and
placed
him
in
a
morris
chair
come
in
and
give
me
your
opinion
of
the
kind
of
cigar
smoked
by
the
president
of
the
publishing
house
for
whose
magazines
i
work
noisily
at
lund
found
himself
a
few
seconds
later
sitting
by
an
open
window
an
excellent
cigar
between
his
teeth
and
the
lights
of
new
york
spread
before
him
and
he
found
his
petulance
vanishing
he
wondered
why
it
was
that
although
he
had
before
this
come
raging
to
anthony
trent
s
door
he
always
suffered
himself
to
be
talked
out
of
his
ill
humors
it
was
something
magnetic
and
engaging
that
surrounded
this
young
writer
of
short
stories
i
can
t
smoke
a
cigar
when
i
m
working
said
trent
lighting
a
pipe
surely
said
lund
not
willing
so
soon
to
be
robbed
of
his
grievance
you
choose
the
wrong
hours
to
work
clarke
says
you
hardly
ever
touch
your
typewriter
till
that
s
because
you
don
t
appreciate
the
kind
of
story
i
write
anthony
trent
told
him
if
i
wrote
the
conventional
story
of
love
or
matrimony
i
could
work
so
many
hours
a
day
and
begin
at
nine
like
any
business
man
but
i
don
t
i
begin
to
write
just
when
the
world
i
write
of
begins
to
live
my
men
and
women
are
waking
into
life
now
just
when
the
other
folks
are
climbing
into
their
suburban
i
understood
you
wrote
detective
stories
lund
remarked
his
grievances
were
vanishing
his
opinion
of
the
president
of
trent
s
magazine
was
a
high
one
crook
stories
anthony
trent
confided
not
the
professional
doings
of
thoughtless
thugs
they
don
t
interest
me
a
tinker
s
curse
i
like
subtlety
in
crime
i
could
take
you
now
into
the
great
restaurants
on
broadway
or
fifth
avenue
and
point
out
to
you
some
of
the
kings
of
crime
men
who
are
clever
enough
to
protect
themselves
from
the
police
men
who
play
the
game
as
a
good
chess
player
does
against
a
poorer
one
with
the
certainty
of
being
a
move
lund
conjured
up
a
vision
of
such
a
restaurant
peopled
by
such
a
festive
crowd
he
felt
in
that
moment
that
an
early
manhood
spent
in
somerville
had
perhaps
robbed
him
of
a
chance
to
live
they
all
get
caught
sooner
or
later
asserted
the
little
man
in
the
morris
chair
because
they
get
careless
or
because
they
trust
another
if
you
want
to
be
a
successful
crook
lund
you
ll
have
to
map
out
your
plan
of
life
as
carefully
as
an
athlete
trains
for
a
specific
event
now
if
you
went
in
for
crime
you
d
have
to
examine
your
thank
you
said
lund
a
little
huffily
i
am
not
going
in
for
a
life
of
crime
i
am
perfectly
content
with
my
own
this
with
unconscious
sarcasm
for
lund
pursued
what
he
always
told
the
borders
was
the
there
are
degrees
in
crime
i
admit
said
anthony
trent
but
i
am
perfectly
serious
in
what
i
say
the
ordinary
crook
has
a
low
mental
capacity
he
generally
gets
caught
in
the
end
as
all
such
clumsy
asses
should
the
really
big
man
in
crime
often
gets
caught
because
he
is
not
aware
of
his
weaknesses
drink
often
brings
out
an
incautious
boasting
side
of
a
man
if
you
are
going
in
for
crime
lund
cut
out
drink
i
beg
of
i
do
not
need
your
advice
lund
returned
with
some
dignity
i
have
tasted
rum
once
only
in
my
trent
looked
at
him
interested
it
would
probably
make
you
want
to
fight
he
said
i
don
t
care
to
think
of
it
said
lund
and
the
curious
part
of
it
is
mused
trent
that
in
the
sort
of
crowd
these
high
class
crooks
mix
with
it
is
most
unusual
not
to
drink
and
the
man
who
doesn
t
is
almost
always
under
suspicion
the
great
thing
is
to
be
able
to
take
your
share
and
stop
before
the
danger
mark
is
reached
did
you
ever
hear
of
captain
despard
i
think
not
lund
answered
a
boyhood
idol
of
mine
anthony
trent
admitted
one
of
the
few
gentleman
crooks
most
of
the
gentlemen
criminals
have
been
anything
but
gentlemen
born
despard
was
i
was
in
devonshire
on
my
last
trip
to
the
other
side
and
i
made
a
pilgrimage
to
the
place
where
he
was
born
funny
to
think
that
a
man
brought
up
in
one
of
the
stately
homes
of
england
how
beautiful
they
stand
should
come
to
what
he
woman
i
suppose
said
lund
as
one
man
of
the
world
to
another
not
in
the
beginning
anthony
trent
answered
he
was
a
cavalry
officer
in
india
kipling
type
you
know
and
had
a
craze
for
precious
stones
began
to
collect
them
honestly
enough
and
found
his
pay
and
private
fortune
insufficient
he
got
kicked
out
of
his
regiment
anyway
and
went
to
cape
town
one
night
a
very
large
diamond
was
stolen
from
a
bedroom
of
the
mount
nelson
hotel
and
he
was
suspected
they
couldn
t
prove
anything
but
he
came
over
here
to
new
york
and
sold
it
under
another
name
and
with
a
different
history
to
one
of
the
pierpoints
the
trouble
with
captain
despard
was
that
he
used
to
drink
heavily
when
he
had
pulled
a
big
thing
off
while
he
was
planning
a
he
was
temperate
and
he
never
touched
a
drop
while
he
was
started
to
boast
i
suppose
lund
suggested
no
said
anthony
trent
not
that
sort
at
all
he
lived
at
a
pretty
fair
sort
of
club
here
in
the
forties
and
was
well
enough
liked
until
the
drink
was
in
him
it
was
then
that
he
began
to
think
of
his
former
mode
of
life
and
the
kind
he
was
now
living
he
used
to
think
the
other
members
were
trying
to
slight
him
or
avoid
him
he
laboriously
picked
quarrels
with
some
of
them
he
beat
up
one
of
them
in
a
fist
fight
in
the
club
billiard
room
this
fellow
brooded
over
his
licking
for
a
long
time
and
then
with
another
man
also
inflamed
with
cocktails
went
up
to
despard
s
room
to
beat
him
up
despard
was
out
so
they
broke
his
furniture
they
found
that
the
legs
of
chairs
and
tables
had
been
hollowed
so
as
to
conceal
what
despard
stole
it
was
in
one
of
the
chairs
that
they
found
the
crediton
pearls
which
had
been
missing
for
a
year
they
waited
for
him
and
he
was
sent
to
sing
sing
but
escaped
he
shot
a
man
later
in
denver
and
was
executed
he
might
have
been
living
comfortably
but
for
getting
suspicious
when
he
had
been
you
must
have
studied
this
thing
deeply
lund
commented
i
have
anthony
trent
admitted
i
know
the
histories
of
most
of
the
great
criminals
and
their
crimes
the
police
do
too
but
i
know
more
than
they
i
make
a
study
of
the
man
as
well
as
his
crime
i
find
vanity
at
the
root
of
many
la
lund
insisted
not
that
sort
of
vanity
anthony
trent
corrected
i
mean
the
sheer
love
to
boast
about
one
s
abilities
when
other
men
are
boasting
of
theirs
there
was
a
man
called
paul
vierick
by
profession
a
second
story
man
he
was
short
stout
and
a
great
consumer
of
beer
and
in
his
idle
hours
fond
of
bowling
he
was
staying
in
stony
creek
connecticut
one
summer
when
a
tennis
ball
was
hit
up
high
and
lodged
in
a
gutter
pipe
on
the
roof
vierick
told
the
young
man
who
had
hit
it
there
how
to
get
it
it
was
so
dangerous
looking
a
climb
that
the
lad
refused
some
of
the
guests
suggested
in
fun
that
vierick
should
try
they
made
him
mad
he
thought
they
were
laughing
at
his
two
hundred
pound
look
they
were
not
to
know
that
a
more
expert
porch
climber
didn
t
exist
than
this
man
who
had
been
a
professional
trapeze
man
in
a
circus
they
say
he
ran
up
the
side
of
that
house
like
a
monkey
directly
he
had
done
it
and
people
began
talking
he
knew
he
d
been
unwise
he
had
been
posing
as
a
retired
dentist
and
here
he
was
running
up
walls
like
the
count
in
dracula
he
moved
away
and
presently
denied
the
story
so
vehemently
that
an
intelligent
young
lawyer
investigated
him
and
he
is
now
up
the
that
s
an
interesting
study
lund
commented
he
was
thoroughly
taken
up
with
the
subject
do
you
know
any
more
instances
like
that
i
know
hundreds
anthony
trent
returned
smiling
i
could
keep
on
all
night
your
town
of
somerville
produced
blodgett
the
strangler
you
must
have
heard
of
him
i
was
at
school
with
him
lund
said
almost
excitedly
it
was
a
secret
he
had
buried
in
his
breast
for
years
now
it
seemed
to
admit
him
to
something
of
a
kinship
with
anthony
trent
he
was
always
chasing
after
that
wasn
t
the
thing
which
got
him
it
was
the
desire
to
set
right
a
harvard
professor
of
anatomy
on
the
subject
of
strangulation
blodgett
had
his
own
theories
you
may
remember
he
strangled
his
stepfather
when
he
was
only
he
nearly
strangled
me
once
lund
exclaimed
he
would
have
done
if
i
hadn
t
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
bite
him
in
the
good
for
you
said
the
other
heartily
you
ll
find
the
history
of
crime
is
full
of
the
little
mistakes
that
take
the
cleverest
of
them
to
the
chair
and
yet
he
mused
it
s
a
great
life
one
man
pitting
his
courage
and
knowledge
against
all
the
forces
organized
by
society
to
stamp
him
out
you
ve
got
to
be
above
the
average
in
almost
every
quality
to
succeed
if
you
work
lund
felt
a
trifle
uncomfortable
the
bright
laughing
face
that
had
been
anthony
trent
to
him
had
given
place
to
a
sterner
cast
of
countenance
the
new
trent
reminded
him
of
a
hawk
there
was
suddenly
brought
to
the
rather
timid
and
elderly
man
the
impression
of
ruthless
strength
and
tireless
energy
he
had
been
a
score
of
times
in
anthony
trent
s
room
and
had
always
found
him
amusing
and
light
hearted
never
until
had
they
touched
upon
crime
the
new
york
over
which
lund
gazed
from
the
seat
by
the
window
no
longer
seemed
a
friendly
city
crime
and
violence
lurked
in
its
every
corner
he
reflected
lund
was
annoyed
with
himself
for
feeling
nervous
to
brace
up
his
courage
he
reverted
to
his
former
grievance
the
sustaining
cigar
had
long
ceased
to
give
comfort
i
must
protest
at
being
waked
up
night
after
night
by
your
typewriting
machine
everybody
seems
to
be
in
bed
and
asleep
but
you
i
must
have
my
eight
hours
anthony
trent
came
to
his
side
everybody
asleep
he
gibed
why
man
the
shadows
are
alive
if
you
ll
only
look
into
them
and
as
to
the
night
it

strange
sounds

blended
into
this
stillness

his
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
and
he
took
the
discomfited
lund
s
arm
can
you
see
a
woman
standing
there
in
the
shadow
of
that
tree
it
might
be
a
woman
lund
admitted
guardedly
it
is
he
was
told
she
followed
not
ten
yards
behind
you
as
you
came
from
the
el
she
s
been
waiting
for
a
man
and
he
ought
to
be
by
in
a
few
minutes
now
she
s
known
in
every
rogues
gallery
in
the
world
scotland

knows
her
as
gipsey
lee
and
if
ever
a
woman
deserved
the
chair
she
not
murder

hazarded
timidly
he
shivered
it
s
a
little
cold
by
the
don

anthony
commanded
you
may
see
a
tragedy
unroll
itself
before
your
eyes
in
a
little
while
she
s
waiting
for
a
banker
named
pereira
who
looted
costa
rica
he
s
a
big
heavy
he
s
coming
now
lund
whispered
i
don
t
like
this
at
all
he
won
t
either
muttered
the
other
unable
to
move
lund
watched
a
tall
man
come
toward
the
shadows
which
hid
gipsey
lee
we
ought
to
warn
him
lund
protested
not
on
your
life
he
was
told
this
time
it
is
punishment
not
murder
she
saved
his
life
and
he
deserted
her
pereira
s
pretending
to
be
drunk
i
wonder
why
he
dare
not
touch
a
drop
because
he
has
bright

disease
in
the

a

later
lund
indignant
and
commanding
as
his
inches
permitted
was
shaking
an
angry
finger
at
his
host
you
ve
no
right
to
frighten
me
he
exclaimed
with
your
gipsey
lee
and
pereira
when
it
was
only
poor
clarke
waiting
for
that
drunken
scamp
of
a
husband
who
spends
all
he
earns
at
the
corner
heavy
steps
passed
along
the
passage
it
was

his
bedward
way
to
his

accompaniment
you
ought
to
be
pleased
to
get
a
thrill
like
that
for
nothing
said
anthony

laughing
i
d
pay
good
money
for
i
don
t
like
it
lund
insisted
i
thought
you
meant
i
did
the
other
asserted
for
the
moment
new
york
is
full
of
such
stories
and
if
they
don
t
happen
in
this
street
they
happen
in
another
they
always
happen
after
midnight
and
i
ve
got
to
put
them
down
on
the
old
machine
somewhere
a

anthony
trent
leaned
from
the
window
and
breathed
in
the
soft
night
air
it
s
a
great
old
city
he
said
half
affectionately
and
i
make
my
living
by
letting
my
hook
down
into
the
night
and
drawing
up
a
mystery
you
mustn
t
mind
if
i
sometimes
rattle
the
old
royal
when
better
folks
are
if
you

take
the
advice
of
an
older
man
said
lund
with
an
air
of
firmness
you
ll
let
crook
stories
alone
and
choose
something
a
little
healthier
your
mind
is
full
of
still
a
little
outraged
lund
bowed
himself
from
the
room
anthony

fed

chapter
iii
the
day
of
temptation
the
dawn
had
long
passed
and
the
milkmen
had
awakened
their
unwilling
clients
two
hours
agone
before
anthony
trent
finished
his
story
he
was
not
a
quick
worker
his
was
a
mind
that
labored
heavily
unless
the
details
of
his
work
were
accurate
this
time
he
was
satisfied
it
was
a
good
story
and
the
editor
for
whom
he
was
doing
a
series
would
be
pleased
he
might
even
increase
his
rates
crosbeigh
the
editor
of
the
magazine
which
sought
anthony
trent
s
crook
stories
was
an
amiable
being
who
had
won
a
reputation
for
profundity
by
reason
of
eloquent
silences
he
would
have
done
well
in
any
line
of
work
where
originality
was
not
desired
he
knew
from
what
his
circulation
manager
told
him
that
trent
s
stories
made
circulation
and
he
liked
the
writer
apart
from
his
work
perhaps
because
he
was
not
a
disappointed
author
he
was
free
from
certain
editorial
prejudices
sit
down
he
cried
cordially
when
anthony
trent
was
shown
in
take
a
cigarette
and
i
ll
read
this
right
crosbeigh
was
a
nervous
man
who
battled
daily
with
subway
crowds
and
was
apt
to
be
irritable
it
s
great
he
said
when
he
had
finished
it
great
doyle
hornung
well
there
you
are
it
was
one
of
his
moments
of
silent
eloquence
the
listener
might
have
inferred
anything
but
they
are
paid
real
money
replied
anthony
trent
gloomily
you
get
two
cents
a
word
crosbeigh
reminded
him
you
haven
t
a
wife
and
children
to
i
d
be
a
gay
little
adventurer
to
try
it
on
what
i
make
at
writing
trent
told
him
it
takes
me
almost
a
month
to
write
one
of
those
yarns
and
i
get
a
hundred
and
fifty
you
are
a
slow
worker
his
editor
declared
i
have
to
be
he
retorted
if
i
were
writing
love
slush
and
pretty
heroine
stuff
it
would
be
different
do
you
know
crosbeigh
there
isn
t
a
thing
in
these
stories
of
mine
that
is
impossible
i
take
the
most
particular
care
that
my
details
are
correct
when
i
began
i
didn
t
know
anything
about
burglar
alarms
what
did
i
do
i
got
a
job
in
the
shop
that
makes
the
best
known
one
i
m
worth
more
than
two
cents
a
word
that
s
our
maximum
crosbeigh
asserted
these
are
not
good
days
for
the
magazine
business
shot
to
pieces
if
i
said
what
i
knew
if
you
knew
what
got
and
how
much
i
had
to
do
with
it
anthony
trent
looked
at
him
critically
he
saw
a
very
carefully
dressed
crosbeigh
a
man
whose
trousers
were
pressed
whose
shoes
were
shined
who
exuded
prosperity
never
had
he
seen
him
so
apparently
affluent
come
into
money
he
enquired
whence
the
prosperity
whose
wardrobe
have
you
robbed
these
are
my
own
clothes
returned
crosbeigh
with
dignity
at
least
leave
me
my
sure
said
trent
amiably
if
i
took
em
you
d
be
arrested
but
tell
me
why
this
sartorial
display
are
you
going
to
be
photographed
for
the
great
editors
series
i
m
lunching
with
an
old
friend
crosbeigh
answered
a
man
of
affairs
a
man
of
millions
a
man
about
whom
i
could
say
many
say
them
his
contributor
demanded
let
me
in
on
a
man
for
whom
you
have
arrayed
yourself
in
all
your
glory
who
is
your
friend
is
she
pretty
i
don
t
believe
it
s
a
man
at
it
s
a
man
i
know
and
respect
he
said
a
trifle
nettled
at
the
comments
his
apparel
had
drawn
it
s
the
man
who
takes
me
every
year
to
the
boat
your
annual
jag
party
he
s
no
fit
company
for
a
respectable
it
is
college
spirit
crosbeigh
explained
you
can
call
it
by
any
name
but
it
s
too
strong
for
you
what
is
the
name
of
your
honored
friend
conington
warren
crosbeigh
said
proudly
that
s
the
millionaire
sportsman
with
the
stable
of
isn
t
it
trent
demanded
he
wins
all
the
big
races
crosbeigh
elaborated
he
s
enormously
rich
splendidly
generous
has
everything
only
one
thing
crosbeigh
fell
into
silence
you
ve
led
him
astray
you
mean
the
spectacle
of
the
sober
editor
consorting
with
reckless
bloods
of
the
conington
warren
type
amused
trent
same
year
at
college
crosbeigh
explained
and
he
has
always
been
friendly
god
knows
why
the
editor
said
gloomily
the
difference
in
their
lot
seemed
suddenly
to
appal
him
there
must
be
something
unsuspectedly
bad
in
your
trent
declared
which
attracts
him
to
you
it
can
t
be
he
wants
to
sell
you
a
there
are
all
sorts
of
rumors
about
him
crosbeigh
went
on
meditatively
started
by
his
wife
s
people
i
believe
he
was
wild
sometimes
he
has
hinted
at
it
i
know
him
well
enough
to
call
him
connie
and
go
up
to
his
sometimes
that
s
a
mark
of
intimacy
my
lord
trent
but
it
makes
me
envious
to
see
with
what
luxury
the
rich
can
live
he
has
a
japanese
valet
and
masseur
togoyama
and
an
imported
butler
who
looks
like
a
bishop
they
know
him
at
his
worst
and
worship
him
he
s
magnetic
that
s
what
connie
is
magnetic
have
you
ever
thought
what
having
a
million
a
year
means
ye
gods
groaned
trent
don
t
you
read
my
lamentations
in
every
story
you
buy
from
me
at
bargain
rates
and
a
shooting
box
in
scotland
which
he
uses
two
weeks
a
year
in
the
grouse
season
a
great
tudor
residence
in
devonshire
overlooking
exmoor
a
town
house
in
park
lane
which
is
london
s
fifth
avenue
and
you
know
what
he
s
got
here
in
his
own
country
can
you
imagine
it
not
on
forty
dollars
a
week
said
anthony
trent
gloomily
you
d
make
more
if
you
were
the
hero
of
your
own
stories
crosbeigh
told
him
anthony
trent
turned
on
him
quickly
what
do
you
mean
why
this
crook
you
are
making
famous
gets
away
with
enough
plunder
to
live
as
well
as
conington
ah
but
that
s
in
a
story
returned
the
author
then
you
mean
they
aren
t
as
exact
and
possible
as
you
ve
been
telling
me
they
are
what
i
said
they
were
their
author
declared
they
could
be
worked
out
with
ordinary
luck
by
any
man
with
an
active
body
good
education
and
address
the
typical
criminal
wouldn
t
have
a
it
was
a
curious
thing
thought
anthony
trent
that
crosbeigh
should
mention
the
very
thing
that
had
been
running
in
his
mind
for
weeks
to
live
in
such
an
elaborate
manner
as
conington
warren
was
not
his
ambition
the
squandering
of
large
sums
of
money
on
stage
favorites
of
the
moment
was
not
to
his
taste
but
he
wanted
certainly
more
than
he
was
earning
trent
had
a
passion
for
fishing
golf
and
music
not
the
fishing
that
may
be
indulged
in
on
sunday
and
on
fishing
steamers
making
excursions
to
the
banks
where
one
may
lose
an
ear
on
another
angler
s
far
flung
hook
but
the
fly
fishing
where
the
gallant
trout
has
a
chance
to
escape
the
highest
type
of
fishing
that
may
appeal
to
man
and
his
ambitions
to
lower
his
golf
handicap
until
it
should
be
scratch
could
not
well
be
accomplished
by
his
weekly
visit
to
van
cortlandt
park
he
wished
to
be
able
to
join
garden
city
or
baltusrol
and
play
a
round
a
day
in
fast
company
and
this
could
not
be
accomplished
on
what
he
was
making
and
as
to
music
he
longed
to
compose
an
opera
it
was
a
laudable
ambition
and
would
commence
he
told
himself
with
a
grand
piano
he
had
only
a
hired
upright
so
far
sometimes
he
had
seen
himself
in
the
rôle
of
his
hero
amply
able
to
indulge
himself
in
his
moderate
ambitions
it
was
of
this
he
had
been
thinking
when
lund
came
to
his
room
and
now
the
very
editor
for
whom
he
had
created
his
characters
was
making
the
suggestion
i
was
only
joking
crosbeigh
assured
him
it
is
not
a
good
thing
to
joke
about
anthony
trent
answered
and
an
honest
man
at
forty
a
week
is
better
than
an
outlaw
with
four
he
made
this
remark
to
set
his
thoughts
in
less
dangerous
channels
but
it
sounded
dreadfully
hollow
and
false
he
half
expected
that
crosbeigh
would
laugh
aloud
at
such
a
hackneyed
sentiment
but
crosbeigh
looked
grave
and
earnest
very
true
he
answered
a
man
couldn
t
think
of
and
why
not
anthony
trent
demanded
would
the
fictional
character
i
created
do
as
much
harm
to
humanity
as
some
cotton
mill
owner
who
enslaved
little
children
and
gave
millions
to
charity
a
telephone
call
relieved
crosbeigh
of
the
need
to
answer
trent
swept
into
his
brief
case
the
carbon
copy
of
his
story
which
he
had
brought
by
mistake
where
are
you
going
the
editor
demanded
van
cortlandt
the
contributor
answered
i
m
going
to
try
and
get
my
drive
back
i
ve
been
slicing
for
a
conington
warren
has
a
private
course
on
his
long
island
place
crosbeigh
said
with
pride
i
ve
been
invited
to
you
re
bent
on
driving
me
to
a
life
of
crime
trent
exclaimed
frowning
an
private
course
while
i
struggle
to
get
a
permit
for
a
public
one
but
anthony
trent
did
not
play
golf
that
afternoon
at
van
cortlandt
park
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
never
again
invaded
that
popular
field
of
play
outside
crosbeigh
s
office
he
was
hailed
by
an
old
dartmouth
chum
one
horace
weems
just
in
time
for
lunch
said
weems
wringing
his
hand
weems
had
always
admired
anthony
trent
and
had
it
been
possible
would
have
remodeled
himself
physically
and
mentally
in
the
form
of
another
trent
weems
was
short
blond
and
perspired
profusely
hello
tubby
said
trent
without
much
cordiality
you
look
as
though
the
world
had
been
treating
you
it
has
said
weems
happily
steel
went
to
a
hundred
and
twelve
last
week
and
it
carried
me
up
with
weems
had
been
as
trent
remembered
a
bond
salesman
weems
could
sell
anything
he
had
an
ingratiating
manner
and
a
disability
to
perceive
snubs
or
insults
when
intent
on
making
sales
he
had
paid
his
way
through
college
by
selling
books
trent
had
been
a
frequent
victim
what
do
you
want
to
sell
me
this
time
he
demanded
nothing
weems
retorted
i
m
going
to
buy
you
the
best
little
lunch
that
manhattan
has
to
offer
anywhere
you
say
and
anything
you
like
to
eat
and
weems
stopped
a
cruising
taxi
hop
in
old
scout
and
tell
the
pirate
where
to
trent
directed
the
man
to
one
of
the
three
famous
and
more
or
less
exclusive
restaurants
new
york
possesses
i
hope
you
have
the
price
he
commented
otherwise
i
shall
have
to
cash
a
check
i
ve
just
received
for
a
keep
your
old
check
jeered
weems
i
m
full
of
money
why
boy
i
own
an
estate
and
have
a
car
of
my
over
the
luncheon
horace
weems
babbled
cheerfully
he
had
made
over
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
and
was
on
his
way
to
millionairedom
you
ought
to
see
my
place
up
in
maine
he
said
presently
maine
queried
his
guest
it
was
in
maine
that
anthony
trent
were
he
fortunate
enough
would
one
day
erect
a
camp
where
on
kennebago
lake
weems
told
him
and
stopped
when
an
expression
of
pain
crossed
the
other
s
face
what
s
the
matter
that
sauce
wrong
just
sheer
envy
trent
admitted
you
ve
got
what
i
want
i
know
every
camp
on
the
lake
which
is
it
the
stanley
place
said
weems
the
finest
camp
on
the
whole
lake
i
bought
it
furnished
and
it
s
some
furniture
believe
me
there
s
a
grand
piano
that
would
please
you
and
pictures
that
are
worth
thousands
one
of
em
by
some
one
named
constable
ever
hear
of
him
yes
trent
grunted
i
have
fancy
you
with
a
constable
and
a
grand
piano
when
you
don
t
know
one
school
of
painting
from
another
and
think
the
phonograph
the
only
instrument
worth
listening
to
i
earned
it
weems
said
a
little
huffily
why
don
t
you
make
money
instead
of
getting
mad
because
i
do
because
i
haven
t
your
ability
i
suppose
trent
admitted
it
s
a
gift
and
the
gods
forgot
some
of
the
boys
used
to
look
down
on
me
said
weems
but
all
i
ask
is
where
is
little
horace
this

work
like
a
horse
to
slide
by

popular
because
you
made
the
football
team
and
could
sing
and
weems
paused
reflectively
i
never
did
hear
any
one
who
could
mimic
like
you
you
should
have
taken
it
up
and
gone
into
vaudeville
how
much

out

rich
as
that
fellow
over
he
pointed
to
a
rather
high
colored
extremely
well
dressed
man
about
town
to
whom
the
waiters
were
paying
extreme
deference
that

said
with
admiration
in
his
voice
he
s
worth
a
million
per
anthony
trent
turned
to
look
at
him
there
was
no
doubt
that
conington
warren
was
a
personage
just
now
he
was
engaged
in
an
argument
with
the
head
waiter
concerning
y
trent
noticed
his
gesture
of
dismissal
when
he
had
finished
it
was
an
imperious
wave
of
his
hand
it
was
his
final
remark
as
it
were
some
spender
weems
commented
who
s
the
funny
old
dodger
with
him
some
other
millionaire
i
i
ll
tell
him
that
next
time
i
see
him
laughed
trent
beholding
crosbeigh
crosbeigh
who
looked
wise
where
vintages
were
discussed
and
knew
not
one
from
another
a
man
paused
at
warren
s
side
and
weems
always
anxious
to
acquire
information
begged
his
guest
to
be
silent
did
you
get
that
he
asked
when
the
man
had
moved
away
i
don
t
make
it
a
habit
to
listen
to
private
conversations
trent
returned
stiffly
well
i
do
said
weems
unabashed
if
i
hadn
t
i
shouldn
t
have
got
in
on
this
steel
stuff
i
m
a
great
little
listener
that
fellow
who
spoke
is
reginald
camplyn
the
man
who
drives
a
coach
and
four
and
wins
blue
ribbons
at
the
horse
show
warren
asked
him
to
a
dinner
here
night
at
half
past
eight
in
honor
of
some
horse
who
s
done
a
fast
weems
made
an
entry
in
his
engagement
book
are
you
going
too
trent
demanded
i
m
putting
down
the
plug
s
name
said
weems
sambo
he
said
that
s
no
name
for
a
thoroughbred
say
couldn
t
you
introduce
me
i
don
t
know
him
trent
asserted
you
know
the
man
with
him
that
s
enough
for
me
if
you
do
it
right
the
other
fellow
s
bound
to
introduce
you
then
you
beckon
me
over
and
we
ll
all
sit
down
that
isn
t
my
way
of
doing
things
replied
trent
with
a
frown
weems
made
a
gesture
of
despair
and
resignation
that
s
why
you
ll
always
be
poor
that
s
why
you
ll
never
have
a
grand
piano
and
a
constable
and
a
swell
place
up
in
anthony
trent
looked
at
him
and
smiled
there
may
be
other
ways
he
said
slowly
you
try
em
weems
retorted
crossly
here
you
are
almost
thirty
years
old
highly
educated
prep
school
and
college
and
you
make
a
week
what
i
give
my
i
think
i
will
trent
answered
weems
attacked
his
salad
angrily
if
only
trent
had
been
what
he
termed
aggressive
an
introduction
could
easily
have
been
effected
then
weems
would
have
seen
to
it
that
he
and
warren
left
the
restaurant
together
some
one
would
be
bound
to
see
them
then
for
weems
had
an
expansive
fancy
it
would
be
rumored
that
he
horace
weems
who
cleaned
up
on
steel
was
friendly
with
the
great
conington
warren
it
might
lead
to
anything
well
he
commented
i
d
rather
be
little
horace
weems
who
can
t
tell
a
phonograph
from
a
grand
piano
than
anthony
trent
who
makes
with
luck
two
thousand
a
i
m
in
bad
company
replied
trent
first
crosbeigh
and
now
you
tempting
me
you
know
very
well
i
haven
t
that
magic
money
making
ability
you
have
my
father
hadn
t
it
or
he
would
have
left
money
when
he
died
and
not
magic
weems
snorted
common
sense
that
s
what
it
it
s
magic
the
other
insisted
as
a
boy
you
exchanged
a
jack
knife
for
a
fishing
pole
and
the
fishing
pole
for
a
camera
and
the
camera
for
a
phonograph
and
the
phonograph
for
a
canoe
and
the
canoe
for
a
sailing
boat
and
so
on
till
you
ve
got
your
place
in
maine
and
a
chauffeur
who
makes
more
than
i
do
magic
s
the
only
name
for
you
must
come
up
and
see
me
in
maine
weems
said
later
make
your
mind
easy
trent
assured
him
i
chapter
iv
beginning
the
game
when
he
left
weems
it
was
too
late
to
start
a
round
of
golf
so
trent
took
his
homeward
way
intent
on
starting
another
story
crosbeigh
was
always
urging
him
to
turn
out
more
of
them
his
boarding
house
room
seemed
shabbier
than
ever
the
rug
which
had
never
been
a
good
one
showed
its
age
the
steel
engravings
on
the
wall
were
offensive
and
weems
he
thought
owns
a
constable
his
upright
piano
sounded
thinner
to
his
touch
and
weems
he
sighed
has
been
able
to
buy
a
up
from
the
kitchen
the
triumphant
smell
of
a
boiled
new
england
dinner
sought
out
every
corner
of
the
house
high
above
all
the
varied
odors
cabbage
was
king
the
prospect
of
the
dinner
table
was
appalling
with
lund
distant
and
ready
to
quarrel
over
any
infringement
of
his
rights
or
curtailment
of
his
portion
clarke
ready
to
resent
any
jest
as
to
her
lord
s
habits
the
landlady
eager
to
give
battle
to
such
as
sniffed
at
what
her
kitchen
had
to
offer
wearisome
banter
between
brainless
boarders
tending
mainly
to
criticism
of
moving
picture
productions
and
speculations
as
to
the
salaries
of
the
stars
not
a
soul
there
who
had
ever
heard
of
william
blake
or
ravel
overdressed
girls
who
were
permanently
annoyed
with
anthony
trent
because
he
would
never
take
them
to
parlors
each
new
boarder
as
she
came
set
her
cap
for
him
and
he
remained
courteous
but
disinterested
one
of
the
epics
of
sauer
s
boarding
house
was
that
night
when
miss
margaret
rafferty
incensed
at
the
coldness
with
which
her
advances
were
received
and
the
jeers
of
her
girl
friends
brought
as
a
dinner
guest
a
former
sweetheart
now
enthusiastically
patrolling
city
sidewalks
as
a
guardian
of
the
peace
it
was
not
difficult
to
inflame
mcguire
he
disliked
anthony
trent
on
sight
and
exercised
an
untrammeled
wit
during
the
dinner
at
his
expense
it
was
afterwards
in
the
little
garden
where
the
men
went
to
smoke
an
after
dinner
cigar
that
the
unforgivable
phrase
was
passed
mcguire
was
just
able
to
walk
home
he
had
met
an
antagonist
who
was
a
lightning
hitter
whose
footwork
was
quick
and
who
boxed
admirably
and
kept
his
head
after
this
a
greater
meed
of
courtesy
was
accorded
the
writer
of
stories
but
the
bibulous
clarke
alone
amused
him
clarke
who
had
been
city
editor
of
a
great
daily
when
trent
was
a
police
reporter
on
it
and
was
now
a
park
row
derelict
supported
by
the
generosity
of
his
old
friends
and
acquaintances
only
clarke
knew
that
anthony
trent
on
numerous
occasions
gave
her
a
little
money
each
week
until
that
day
in
the
greek
kalends
when
her
husband
would
find
another
position
anthony
trent
settled
himself
at
his
typewriter
and
began
looking
over
the
carbon
copy
of
the
story
he
had
just
sold
to
crosbeigh
he
wished
to
assure
himself
of
certain
details
in
it
among
the
pages
was
an
envelope
with
the
name
of
a
celebrated
fifth
avenue
club
embossed
upon
it
written
on
it
in
pencil
was
crosbeigh
s
name
unquestionably
he
had
swept
it
from
the
editorial
desk
when
he
had
taken
up
the
carbon
copy
of
his
story
opening
it
he
found
a
note
written
in
a
rather
cramped
and
angular
hand
the
stationery
was
of
the
fifth
avenue
club
the
signature
was
unmistakable
conington
trent
read
my
dear
crosbeigh
i
am
sending
this
note
by
togoyama
because
i
want
to
be
sure
that
you
will
lunch
with
me
at
voisin
s
at
one
o
clock
i
wish
affairs
permitted
me
to
see
more
of
my
old
yale
comrades
but
i
am
enormously
busy
by
the
way
a
little
friend
of
mine
thinks
she
can
write
i
don
t
suppose
she
can
but
i
promised
to
show
her
efforts
to
you
i
m
no
judge
but
it
seems
to
me
her
work
is
very
much
the
kind
you
publish
in
your
magazine
we
will
talk
it
over
of
course
she
cares
nothing
about
what
you
would
pay
her
she
wants
to
see
her
name
in
print
yours
ever
conington
trent
picked
up
an
eraser
and
passed
it
over
the
name
on
the
envelope
it
had
been
written
with
a
soft
pencil
and
was
easily
swept
away
over
the
body
of
the
letter
he
spent
a
long
time
he
copied
it
exactly
a
stranger
would
have
sworn
that
the
copy
had
been
written
by
the
same
hand
which
indited
the
original
and
when
this
copy
had
been
made
to
trent
s
satisfaction
he
carefully
erased
everything
in
the
original
but
the
signature
then
remembering
weems
description
of
the
conington
warren
camp
in
the
adirondacks
he
wrote
a
little
note
to
one
togoyama
it
was
five
when
he
had
finished
there
was
no
indecision
about
him
twenty
minutes
later
he
was
at
the
public
library
consulting
a
large
volume
in
which
were
a
hundred
of
the
best
known
residences
in
new
york
so
conscientious
was
the
writer
that
there
were
plans
of
every
floor
and
in
many
instances
descriptions
of
their
interior
decoration
anthony
trent
chuckled
to
think
of
the
difficulties
with
which
the
unlettered
crook
has
to
contend
chicago
ed
binner
for
example
had
married
half
a
hundred
servant
maids
to
obtain
information
as
to
the
disposition
of
rooms
that
he
could
have
obtained
by
the
mere
consultation
of
such
a
book
as
this
it
was
while
sauer
s
wards
were
finishing
their
boiled
dinner
that
some
of
them
had
a
glimpse
of
anthony
trent
in
evening
dress
descending
the
stairs
dinner
not
good
enough
for
his
nibs
commented
one
boarder
seeking
to
curry
the
sauer
favor
i
d
rather
have
my
boarders
pay
and
not
eat
than
eat
and
not
pay
said
sauer
grimly
it
was
three
weeks
since
she
had
received
a
dollar
from
the
speaker
drink
exclaimed
clarke
suddenly
roused
from
meditation
of
a
day
now
dead
when
a
highball
could
be
purchased
for
fifteen
cents
this
food
shortage
now
that
could
be
settled
easily
take
the
tax
off
liquor
and
people
wouldn
t
want
to
eat
so
much
it
s
the
high
cost
of
drinking
that
s
the
trouble
what
s
the
use
of
calling
ourselves
a
free
people
i
tell
you
it
was
keeping
vodka
from
the
russians
that
caused
the
whole
trouble
don
t
argue
with
me
i
clarke
went
from
the
dinner
table
to
his
bed
and
awoke
around
midnight
possessed
with
the
seven
demons
of
unsatiated
thirst
he
determined
to
go
down
and
call
upon
anthony
trent
he
would
plead
for
enough
money
to
go
to
the
druggist
and
get
his
wife
s
prescription
filled
trent
good
lad
that
he
was
always
fell
for
it
and
he
argued
it
was
a
friendly
act
to
do
this
midnight
call
on
a
hard
working
young
writer
who
had
once
been
at
his
command
for
the
first
time
anthony
trent
s
door
was
locked
and
the
voice
that
snapped
out
an
interrogation
was
different
from
the
leisurely
and
amiable
invitation
to
enter
which
was
usual
the
door
was
suddenly
flung
open
so
sudden
that
poor
clarke
was
startled
and
facing
him
his
fists
clenched
and
a
certain
tensity
of
attitude
that
was
a
strange
one
to
the
visitor
was
anthony
trent
still
in
evening
dress
clarke
construed
it
into
an
expression
of
resentment
at
his
intrusion
he
could
not
understand
the
sudden
affability
that
took
possession
of
his
former
reporter
come
in
clarke
said
trent
cordially
i
am
sorry
your
wife
s
heart
is
troubling
her
but
i
agree
with
you
that
you
should
rush
with
all
haste
to
the
nearby
druggist
and
have
that
prescription
filled
and
as
the
man
who
owes
you
money
did
not
pay
you
as
he
promised
but
will
without
fail
at
midday
take
this
five
dollar
bill
with
my
how
did
you
know
gasped
clarke
i
am
a
mind
reader
trent
retorted
it
saves
he
led
clarke
gently
to
the
door
now
i
m
tired
and
want
to
go
to
sleep
so
don
t
call
in
on
your
way
back
with
the
change
just
trot
up
to
bed
as
quietly
as
you
when
the
door
was
locked
and
a
wedged
against
the
handle
trent
lowered
the
shades
then
he
cleared
his
table
of
the
litter
of
paper
a
half
dozen
pages
of
the
first
draft
of
his
new
story
held
his
attention
for
a
few
seconds
then
he
deliberately
tore
the
pages
into
little
fragments
threw
them
into
the
waste
paper
basket
and
to
this
cenotaph
he
added
the
contents
of
the
table
drawer
made
up
of
notes
for
future
stories
the
results
of
weeks
of
labor
dust
to
dust
he
murmured
ashes
to
ashes
it
was
the
end
of
the
career
of
anthony
trent
writer
and
on
the
table
which
had
formerly
held
only
writing
paper
a
quaint
miscellany
was
placed
eight
scarf
pins
each
holding
in
golden
claws
stones
of
price
apparently
conington
warren
had
about
him
only
what
was
good
and
there
was
a
heavy
platinum
ring
with
a
ruby
of
not
less
than
four
carats
a
lady
s
ring
it
would
not
be
difficult
for
a
man
so
clever
with
his
hands
and
apt
mechanically
to
remove
these
jewels
from
their
setting
nor
was
there
any
difficulty
in
melting
the
precious
metals
it
seemed
to
trent
that
he
had
gloated
over
these
glistening
stones
for
hours
before
he
put
them
away
then
he
took
out
a
roll
of
bills
and
counted
them
conington
warren
it
seemed
must
have
had
considerable
faith
in
the
excellent
togoyama
now
hurrying
to
the
adirondack
camp
for
he
had
left
three
thousand
dollars
in
the
upper
left
hand
drawer
of
a
sheraton
desk
morning
was
coming
down
the
skies
when
trent
now
in
dressing
gown
lighted
his
pipe
and
sat
down
by
the
window
well
he
muttered
softly
i
ve
done
it
and
there
s
no
going
back
yesterday
i
was
what
people
call
an
honest
man
now
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
puffed
quickly
out
of
the
window
grey
clouds
of
smoke
rose
as
fragrant
incense
he
had
never
meant
to
take
up
a
career
of
crime
looking
back
he
could
see
how
little
things
coming
together
had
provoked
in
him
an
insatiable
desire
for
an
easier
life
in
all
his
personal
dealings
heretofore
he
had
been
scrupulously
honest
and
there
had
never
been
any
reflection
on
his
honor
as
a
sportsman
he
had
played
games
for
their
own
sake
he
had
won
without
bragging
and
lost
with
excuses
up
in
hanover
there
were
still
left
those
who
chanted
his
praise
what
would
people
think
of
him
if
he
were
placed
in
the
dock
as
a
criminal
his
own
people
were
dead
there
were
distant
cousins
in
cleveland
whom
he
hardly
remembered
there
was
no
family
honor
to
trail
in
the
dust
no
mother
or
sweetheart
to
blame
him
for
a
broken
heart
he
stirred
uneasily
as
he
thought
of
the
possibility
of
capture
even
now
those
might
be
on
his
trail
who
would
arrest
him
it
would
be
ironical
if
before
he
tasted
the
fruits
of
leisure
he
were
taken
to
prison
perhaps
by
officer
mcguire
it
had
all
been
so
absurdly
easy
within
a
few
minutes
of
receiving
the
forged
note
the
japanese
was
on
his
way
to
the
mountains
the
butler
who
adored
his
master
according
to
crosbeigh
had
seemed
utterly
without
suspicion
when
he
passed
trent
engaged
in
animated
converse
with
his
supposed
employer
the
bad
moment
was
when
the
man
had
come
into
the
library
where
the
intruder
was
hiding
himself
and
stood
there
waiting
for
an
answer
to
his
question
trent
had
seen
to
it
that
the
light
was
low
it
was
a
moment
of
inspiration
when
he
called
to
mind
conington
warren
s
imperious
gesture
as
he
waved
away
voisin
s
head
waiter
and
another
which
had
made
him
put
on
the
velvet
smoking
jacket
and
it
had
all
come
out
without
a
hitch
but
he
was
playing
a
game
now
when
he
could
never
be
certain
he
was
not
outguessed
it
might
be
the
suave
butler
was
outside
in
the
shadows
guiding
police
to
the
capture
he
looked
out
of
the
window
and
down
the
silent
street
there
was
indeed
a
man
outside
and
looking
up
at
him
but
it
was
only
poor
clarke
whose
own
prescription
had
been
too
well
filled
he
had
captured
so
he
fancied
an
errant
lamppost
wantonly
disporting
itself
anthony
trent
looked
at
him
with
a
relief
in
which
disgust
had
its
part
he
swore
by
all
the
high
gods
never
to
sink
to
that
level
a
curious
turn
of
mind
perhaps
for
a
burglar
to
take
but
so
far
the
sporting
simile
presented
itself
to
him
it
was
a
game
a
big
game
in
which
he
took
bigger
risks
than
any
one
else
he
was
going
to
pit
his
wit
strength
and
knowledge
against
society
as
it
was
organized
i
don
t
see
why
i
can
t
play
it
decently
he
said
to
himself
as
he
climbed
into
bed
chapter
v
anthony
pulls
up
stakes
when
those
two
great
australians
norman
brooks
and
anthony
wilding
had
played
their
brilliant
tennis
in
america
trent
had
been
a
close
follower
of
their
play
he
had
interviewed
them
for
his
paper
in
those
days
he
himself
was
a
respectable
performer
at
the
game
brooks
had
given
him
one
of
his
own
rackets
which
was
no
longer
in
first
class
condition
it
was
especially
made
for
the
australian
by
a
firm
in
melbourne
so
pleased
was
trent
with
it
that
he
later
sent
to
australia
for
two
more
it
happened
that
the
manager
of
the
sporting
goods
store
in
melbourne
was
a
young
american
who
believed
in
the
efficacy
of
follow
up
letters
it
was
a
large
and
prosperous
firm
and
it
followed
up
anthony
trent
with
thoroughness
he
received
square
envelopes
addressed
by
hand
by
every
third
australian
mail
sauer
s
boarders
being
of
that
kind
which
interests
itself
in
others
affairs
and
discusses
them
were
intrigued
at
these
frequent
missives
from
the
antipodes
finally
trent
invented
an
uncle
samuel
who
had
so
he
affirmed
left
his
native
land
when
an
adventurous
child
of
nine
and
made
a
great
fortune
among
the
calgoorlie
gold
fields
possessing
a
nimble
wit
he
related
to
his
fellow
boarders
amazing
accounts
of
his
uncle
s
activities
the
boarders
often
discussed
this
uncle
his
strange
dislike
of
women
the
beard
which
fell
to
his
knees
the
team
of
racing
kangaroos
which
drew
his
buggy
and
so
forth
at
the
breakfast
table
on
the
morning
when
anthony
trent
faced
his
world
no
longer
an
honest
man
it
was
observed
that
he
was
disinclined
to
talk
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
wanted
a
reasonable
excuse
for
leaving
the
sauer
establishment
the
woman
had
been
kind
and
considerate
to
him
and
he
had
few
grievances
the
mail
brought
him
an
enticing
letter
from
melbourne
offering
him
all
that
the
tennis
player
needs
at
special
prices
i
trust
your
uncle
is
well
clarke
observed
it
was
in
that
moment
trent
got
his
inspiration
i
m
afraid
he
is
very
ill
he
said
sadly
at
his
age
he
must
be
almost
ninety
only
clarke
reminded
him
she
remembered
the
year
of
his
emigration
is
a
great
age
to
attain
he
declared
and
he
has
lived
not
wisely
but
well
i
feel
i
should
go
out
and
see
if
there
s
anything
i
can
you
are
going
to
leave
us
gasped
sauer
his
going
would
deprive
her
of
a
most
satisfactory
lodger
i
m
afraid
my
duty
is
plain
he
returned
gravely
thus
he
left
sauer
s
establishment
years
later
he
wondered
whether
if
he
had
enjoyed
better
cooking
he
would
have
fallen
from
grace
and
if
he
could
not
with
justice
blame
a
new
england
boiled
dinner
for
his
lapse
for
a
few
days
he
stayed
at
a
quiet
hotel
he
wanted
a
small
apartment
on
central
park
there
were
reasons
for
this
first
he
must
live
alone
in
a
house
where
no
officious
elevator
boys
observed
his
going
and
his
coming
central
park
west
offered
many
such
houses
and
if
it
should
happen
that
he
ever
had
to
flee
from
the
pursuit
of
those
who
guarded
the
mansions
that
faced
him
on
the
park
s
eastern
side
there
was
no
safer
way
home
than
across
the
silent
grass
he
was
one
of
those
new
yorkers
who
know
their
central
park
there
had
been
a
season
when
a
friend
gave
him
the
use
of
a
saddle
horse
and
there
was
no
bridle
path
that
he
did
not
know
he
was
fortunate
in
finding
rooms
at
the
top
of
a
fine
old
brownstone
house
in
the
eighties
there
were
four
large
rooms
all
overlooking
the
park
that
he
was
compelled
to
climb
five
flights
of
stairs
was
no
objection
in
his
eyes
a
little
door
to
the
left
of
his
own
entrance
gave
admission
to
a
ladder
leading
to
the
roof
none
of
the
other
tenants
so
the
agent
informed
him
ever
used
it
anthony
trent
was
relieved
to
hear
it
i
sleep
badly
he
said
possibly
because
i
read
a
great
deal
and
am
anxious
to
try
open
air
sleeping
if
i
might
have
the
right
to
use
the
roof
for
that
i
should
be
very
willing
to
pay
glad
to
have
you
there
said
the
agent
heartily
you
ll
be
a
sort
of
night
watchman
for
the
he
laughed
at
his
jest
insomnia
is
plain
hell
ain
t
it
i
used
to
suffer
that
way
i
walk
a
great
deal
now
and
that
cures
me
do
you
take
drugs
i
m
afraid
of
them
anthony
trent
declared
i
walk
a
good
deal
at
night
when
the
streets
are
the
agent
reported
to
his
office
that
trent
was
a
studious
man
who
slept
badly
and
wanted
to
sleep
on
the
roof
also
that
he
took
long
tramps
at
night
a
good
tenant
in
fine
thus
he
spread
abroad
the
report
which
trent
desired
the
selection
of
a
housekeeper
was
of
extreme
importance
she
must
be
an
elderly
quiet
body
without
callers
or
city
relatives
her
references
must
be
examined
thoroughly
he
interviewed
a
score
of
women
before
he
found
what
he
wanted
she
was
a
phoebe
kinney
from
agawam
a
village
overlooking
buzzard
s
bay
a
widow
childless
and
friendless
she
had
occupied
similar
positions
in
massachusetts
but
this
would
be
the
first
one
in
new
york
he
observed
in
his
talk
with
her
that
she
conceived
the
metropolis
to
be
the
world
center
of
wickedness
she
assured
her
future
employer
that
she
kept
herself
to
herself
because
she
could
never
be
certain
that
the
man
or
woman
who
addressed
a
friendly
remark
to
her
might
not
be
a
criminal
keep
that
attitude
and
we
two
shall
agree
splendidly
he
said
i
have
few
friends
and
no
callers
i
am
of
a
studious
disposition
and
can
not
bear
interruptions
if
you
had
friends
in
new
york
i
should
not
hire
you
i
sometimes
keep
irregular
hours
but
i
shall
expect
to
find
you
there
all
the
time
you
can
have
two
weeks
in
the
summer
if
you
want
next
day
kinney
was
inducted
to
her
new
home
it
was
a
happy
choice
for
she
cooked
well
and
had
the
new
england
passion
for
cleanliness
trent
noticed
with
pleasure
that
she
was
even
suspicious
of
the
tradespeople
who
sent
their
wares
up
the
dumb
waiter
and
she
discouraged
their
gossip
who
sold
meat
and
bread
to
her
the
many
papers
he
took
were
searched
for
their
crimes
by
kinney
discovery
of
such
records
affirmed
her
in
her
belief
of
the
city
s
depravity
in
his
examination
of
her
former
positions
trent
discovered
that
she
had
been
housekeeper
to
the
clent
bulstrodes
he
knew
they
were
a
fine
old
boston
family
of
back
bay
with
a
mansion
on
beacon
street
when
he
questioned
her
about
it
she
told
him
it
was
as
housekeeper
of
their
summer
home
on
buzzards
bay
young
graham
bulstrode
had
been
a
tennis
player
of
note
years
before
many
a
time
anthony
trent
had
seen
him
at
longwood
he
had
dropped
out
because
he
drank
too
much
to
keep
fit
the
two
were
of
an
age
kinney
related
the
history
of
the
bulstrode
family
at
length
and
concluded
by
remarking
that
when
she
first
saw
her
employer
at
the
agency
she
was
reminded
of
graham
but
he
looks
terrible
now
she
added
they
say
he
drinks
brandy
before
breakfast
the
next
day
the
society
columns
of
the
informed
him
that
the
clent
bulstrodes
had
bought
a
new
york
residence
in
east
street
just
off
the
avenue
this
information
was
of
peculiar
interest
to
trent
now
he
was
definitely
engaged
in
a
precarious
profession
he
was
determined
to
make
a
success
of
it
he
had
smoked
innumerable
pipes
in
tabulating
those
accidents
which
brought
most
criminals
to
sentence
he
believed
in
the
majority
of
cases
they
had
not
the
address
to
get
away
with
plausible
excuses
it
was
an
ancient
and
frayed
excuse
that
of
pretending
to
be
sent
to
read
the
water
or
electric
meter
and
besides
it
was
not
trent
s
intention
to
take
to
disguises
of
this
sort
he
was
now
engaged
in
working
out
the
solution
of
his
second
adventure
he
was
to
make
an
attempt
upon
the
house
of
william
drummond
banker
who
lived
in
street
and
in
the
same
number
as
did
the
clent
bulstrodes
twenty
blocks
to
the
south
he
had
learned
a
great
deal
about
drummond
from
clarke
his
city
editor
clarke
remembered
most
of
the
interesting
things
about
the
big
men
of
his
day
he
told
trent
that
drummond
invariably
carried
a
great
deal
of
money
on
his
person
he
expatiated
on
the
drummond
history
this
william
drummond
had
begun
life
on
an
iowa
farm
he
had
gradually
saved
a
little
money
and
then
lent
it
at
extravagant
interest
later
he
specialized
on
mortgages
foreclosing
directly
he
knew
his
client
unable
to
meet
his
notes
his
type
was
a
familiar
one
and
had
founded
many
fortunes
clarke
painted
him
as
a
singularly
detestable
creature
but
why
demanded
anthony
trent
does
a
man
like
that
risk
his
money
if
he
s
so
keen
on
conserving
it
one
would
think
he
wouldn
t
take
out
more
than
his
car
fare
for
fearing
either
of
being
robbed
or
borrowed
as
for
robbing
clarke
returned
he
s
a
great
husky
beast
although
he
s
nearly
sixty
and
as
to
being
borrowed
from
that
s
why
he
takes
it
out
he
belongs
to
a
lot
of
clubs
not
the
knickerbocker
type
but
the
sort
of
clubs
where
rich
young
fellows
go
to
play
poker
they
know
old
drummond
can
lend
em
the
ready
cash
without
any
formalities
any
time
they
wish
it
ever
sit
in
a
poker
game
son
and
get
a
hunch
that
if
you
were
able
to
buy
just
one
more
pile
of
chips
you
d
clean
up
i
have
said
the
other
smiling
but
my
hunch
has
generally
been
most
hunches
are
clarke
commented
theirs
are
too
but
that
old
scoundrel
makes
thousands
out
of
just
such
hunches
he
puts
it
up
to
the
borrower
that
it
s
between
club
members
and
so
forth
not
a
money
lending
transaction
tells
em
he
doesn
t
lend
money
as
a
rule
and
so
forth
and
so
on
i
know
he
was
asked
to
resign
from
one
club
for
it
he
s
a
bloodsucker
and
if
i
had
an
automobile
i
d
watch
for
him
to
cross
the
street
and
then
run
him
has
he
ever
stung
you
trent
asked
me
not
on
your
life
he
specializes
in
rich
men
s
sons
he
wouldn
t
lend
you
or
me
a
nickel
if
we
were
starving
you
remember
young
hodgson
grant
who
committed
suicide
last
year
they
said
it
was
the
heat
that
got
him
it
was
william
why
does
he
keep
up
a
house
on
such
a
street
as
he
does
i
should
think
he
d
live
a
young
second
wife
threw
the
old
one
away
so
to
speak
and
got
a
high
stepper
that
makes
him
speed
up
she
thinks
she
will
get
into
society
not
a
chance
son
not
a
chance
i
it
was
on
some
of
william
drummond
s
money
that
anthony
trent
had
set
his
heart
it
salved
what
was
still
a
conscience
to
know
that
he
was
taking
back
profits
unlawfully
made
bleeding
a
blood
sucker
owing
to
the
second
drummond
s
desire
to
storm
society
she
cultivated
publicity
there
were
pictures
of
herself
and
her
prize
winning
red
chows
in
dog
papers
in
other
magazines
she
was
seen
driving
her
two
high
stepping
hackneys
lord
ping
and
lady
pong
at
the
mineola
horse
show
also
there
was
an
article
on
her
home
in
a
magazine
devoted
to
interior
decoration
a
careful
study
of
it
answered
every
question
concerning
its
that
the
most
careful
cracksman
needed
to
know
trent
spent
a
week
in
learning
how
drummond
occupied
his
time
the
banker
invariably
left
his
most
profitable
club
at
midnight
never
earlier
by
half
past
twelve
he
was
in
his
library
smoking
one
of
the
cigars
that
had
been
given
him
that
night
then
a
drink
of
gin
and
water
afterwards
bed
the
house
was
protected
by
the
sherlock
system
of
burglar
alarm
a
tiresome
invention
to
those
who
were
ignorant
of
it
anthony
trent
regarded
it
as
an
enemy
and
had
mastered
it
successfully
for
there
were
tricks
of
lock
opening
not
hard
to
one
as
mechanically
able
as
he
and
many
a
criminal
had
talked
to
him
openly
when
he
had
covered
police
headquarters
years
before
drummond
drank
very
little
when
asked
he
invariably
took
a
cigar
he
was
possessed
of
great
strength
and
still
patronized
the
club
gymnasium
for
two
hours
one
night
drummond
sat
near
him
at
a
certain
famous
athletic
club
on
that
night
there
were
certain
changes
to
be
observed
in
the
appearance
of
anthony
trent
he
seemed
to
have
put
on
twenty
pounds
in
weight
and
ten
years
in
age
the
art
of
which
had
been
forced
upon
him
in
college
theatricals
had
recently
engaged
his
attention
it
was
an
art
of
which
he
had
thought
little
until
for
his
paper
he
had
once
interviewed
beerbohm
tree
and
had
seen
the
amazing
changes
skilful
may
create
ordinarily
he
slipped
in
and
out
silently
not
encouraging
kinney
to
talk
on
this
particular
night
he
asked
her
a
question
concerning
a
missing
letter
and
she
came
out
into
the
lighted
hall
you
gave
me
quite
a
shock
she
said
you
look
as
like
graham
bulstrode
as
one
pea
is
like
another
although
i
ve
never
seen
him
in
full
evening
she
was
plainly
impressed
by
her
employer
s
magnificence
although
she
feared
this
unusual
flush
on
his
ordinarily
pale
face
meant
that
he
had
been
having
more
to
drink
than
was
good
for
him
it
was
the
tribute
for
which
trent
had
waited
if
kinney
had
never
seen
the
son
of
her
former
master
in
the
garb
of
fashion
her
present
employer
had
and
that
within
the
week
and
he
had
observed
him
carefully
he
had
seen
that
bulstrode
was
wearing
during
the
nights
of
late
autumn
an
inverness
cape
of
black
cloth
lined
with
white
silk
to
trent
it
seemed
rather
stagey
but
that
did
not
prevent
him
from
ordering
its
duplicate
from
bulstrode
s
tailor
bulstrode
clung
to
the
opera
hat
rather
than
to
the
silk
hat
which
has
almost
superseded
it
trent
wore
an
opera
hat
bulstrode
came
into
the
athletic
club
at
half
past
eleven
he
was
slightly
under
the
influence
of
liquor
and
his
face
no
redder
than
that
of
trent
who
waited
across
the
street
in
the
shadow
of
the
park
wall
no
sooner
had
bulstrode
been
whirled
off
in
a
taxi
than
anthony
trent
went
into
the
club
to
the
attendants
it
seemed
that
he
had
returned
for
something
forgotten
with
his
inverness
still
on
and
his
hat
folded
he
lost
himself
in
the
crowded
rooms
and
found
at
last
william
drummond
the
banker
nodded
cordially
it
was
evident
to
the
impostor
that
the
banker
wished
to
ingratiate
himself
with
the
new
member
the
bulstrodes
had
enormous
wealth
and
a
name
that
was
recognized
to
his
greeting
anthony
trent
returned
a
solemn
stare
shylock
he
hiccoughed
insolently
drummond
flushed
but
said
nothing
indeed
he
looked
about
him
to
see
if
the
insult
had
been
overheard
by
any
other
member
inwardly
trent
chuckled
he
had
now
no
fear
of
being
discovered
bulstrode
probably
knew
few
men
at
the
club
he
had
not
been
in
town
as
a
resident
for
a
month
yet
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
read
an
evening
paper
watching
in
reality
the
man
drummond
chapter
vi
fooling
shylock
drummond
the
night
that
he
entered
drummond
s
house
was
slightly
foggy
and
visibility
was
low
he
was
dressed
as
he
had
been
when
he
encountered
drummond
at
the
club
he
had
seen
the
banker
climb
the
five
steps
to
his
front
door
at
half
past
twelve
at
half
past
one
the
lights
were
switched
off
in
the
bedroom
on
the
second
floor
at
two
the
door
gently
opened
and
admitted
anthony
trent
he
left
it
unlocked
and
ready
for
flight
and
he
memorized
the
position
of
the
furniture
so
that
hasty
flight
would
be
possible
it
was
not
a
big
house
the
articles
of
furniture
the
pictures
rugs
and
hangings
were
splendid
the
interior
decorators
had
taken
care
of
that
but
he
had
seen
them
all
in
the
magazine
trent
knew
very
well
that
to
obtain
such
prizes
as
he
sought
could
not
be
a
matter
of
certainty
somewhere
in
this
house
was
a
lot
of
currency
and
it
might
be
in
a
safe
old
fashioned
safes
presented
few
difficulties
but
your
modern
strong
box
is
a
different
matter
criminal
investigator
as
he
was
he
knew
one
man
seldom
attempted
to
dynamite
a
safe
it
was
a
matter
for
several
men
in
itself
the
technique
was
not
difficult
but
he
had
no
accomplices
and
at
best
it
is
a
matter
better
fitted
for
offices
in
the
night
silences
than
a
private
residence
he
had
been
told
by
criminals
that
it
was
astonishing
how
careless
rich
men
were
with
their
money
anthony
trent
proposed
to
test
this
he
had
made
only
a
noiseless
progress
on
a
half
dozen
stairs
on
his
upward
flight
when
a
door
suddenly
opened
flooding
the
stairway
with
light
it
was
from
a
room
above
him
and
there
were
steps
coming
along
a
corridor
toward
him
feeling
certain
that
the
reception
rooms
leading
off
the
entrance
hall
were
empty
he
swiftly
opened
a
door
and
stepped
backward
into
the
room
watching
intently
to
see
that
he
had
escaped
the
observation
of
some
one
descending
the
staircase
from
the
frying
pan
s
discomfort
to
the
greater
dangers
of
the
fire
was
what
he
had
done
for
himself
he
found
himself
in
a
long
room
at
one
end
of
which
he
stood
swearing
under
breath
at
what
he
saw
at
the
other
william
drummond
was
seated
at
a
table
and
drummond
held
in
his
hand
an
ugly
automatic
of
calibre
covering
him
with
the
weapon
the
banker
came
swiftly
toward
him
it
was
the
unexpected
moment
for
which
anthony
trent
was
prepared
assuming
the
demeanor
of
the
drunken
man
he
peered
into
the
elder
man
s
face
he
betrayed
no
fear
of
the
pistol
his
speech
was
thickened
but
he
was
reasonably
coherent
it
is
old
drummond
isn
t
it
he
demanded
what
are
you
doing
here
the
other
snapped
and
then
gave
a
start
when
he
saw
to
whom
he
spoke
mr
bulstrode
i
ve
come
said
the
other
swaying
slightly
to
tell
you
i
m
sorry
i
don
t
know
why
i
said
it
but
the
other
fellers
said
it
wasn
t
right
i
ve
come
to
shake
your
he
caught
sight
of
the
weapon
put
that
damn
thing
down
obediently
the
banker
slipped
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
dressing
gown
he
followed
the
swaying
man
as
he
walked
toward
the
lighted
part
of
the
room
he
was
frankly
amazed
wild
as
he
was
and
drunken
as
was
his
evening
custom
why
had
this
heir
to
the
bulstrode
millions
entered
his
house
like
a
thief
in
the
night
and
for
what
was
he
sorry
in
a
chair
by
the
side
of
the
desk
anthony
trent
flung
himself
he
wanted
particularly
to
see
what
the
banker
had
hidden
with
a
swift
motion
as
he
had
risen
the
yellow
end
of
some
notes
of
high
denomination
caught
his
eye
right
on
the
table
was
what
he
sought
the
only
method
of
getting
it
would
be
to
overpower
drummond
there
were
objections
to
this
the
banker
was
armed
and
would
certainly
shoot
or
there
might
be
a
terrific
physical
encounter
in
which
the
younger
man
might
kill
unintentionally
and
an
end
in
the
electric
chair
was
no
part
of
trent
s
scheme
of
things
also
there
was
some
one
else
awake
in
the
house
drummond
resumed
his
seat
and
the
watcher
saw
him
with
elaborate
unconcern
slide
an
evening
paper
over
the
partially
concealed
notes
just
what
is
on
your
mind
bulstrode
he
began
i
called
you
shylock
trent
returned
no
right
to
have
said
it
what
i
should
have
said
was
come
and
have
a
been
ashamed
of
myself
ever
drummond
looked
at
him
fixedly
it
was
a
calculating
glance
and
a
cold
one
and
there
was
the
contempt
in
it
that
a
sober
man
has
for
one
far
gone
in
drink
and
do
you
usually
break
into
a
man
s
house
when
you
want
to
apologize
there
was
almost
a
sneer
in
his
voice
break
in
retorted
the
other
apparently
slow
at
comprehending
him
the
damn
door
wasn
t
locked
any
one
could
get
in
burglars
could
break
through
and
steal
most
foolish
i
lock
my
door
every
night
all
sensible
people
do
surprised
at
we
ll
see
about
that
said
drummond
he
took
a
grip
on
his
visitor
s
arm
and
led
him
through
the
hall
to
the
door
it
was
unlocked
and
the
burglar
alarm
system
disconnected
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
drummond
s
man
had
forgotten
it
in
the
morning
he
would
be
dismissed
apparently
this
irresponsible
young
ass
had
got
the
idea
in
his
stupid
head
that
he
had
acted
offensively
and
had
calmly
walked
in
it
was
the
opportunity
for
the
banker
to
cultivate
him
as
i
came
in
trent
told
him
some
one
was
coming
down
the
stairs
better
see
who
it
drummond
looked
at
him
suspiciously
trent
knew
that
he
was
not
yet
satisfied
that
his
visitor
s
story
was
worthy
of
belief
then
he
spoke
as
one
who
humors
a
child
we
ll
go
and
find
outside
the
door
they
came
upon
an
elderly
woman
servant
with
a
silver
tray
in
her
hands
madame
she
explained
was
not
able
to
eat
any
luncheon
or
dinner
and
has
waked
up
drummond
raised
the
cover
of
a
porcelain
dish
caviare
sandwiches
he
grunted
bad
things
to
sleep
he
led
the
way
back
to
the
room
in
his
scheming
mind
was
a
vague
scheme
to
use
this
bêtise
of
graham
bulstrode
as
a
means
to
win
his
wife
social
advancement
clent
bulstrode
could
do
it
money
would
not
buy
recognition
from
her
perhaps
fear
of
exposure
might
he
glanced
with
contempt
at
the
huddled
figure
of
the
heir
to
bulstrode
millions
the
young
man
was
too
much
intoxicated
to
offer
any
resistance
tall
huge
and
menacing
he
stood
over
anthony
trent
there
was
a
look
in
his
eye
that
caused
a
certain
uneasiness
in
the
impostor
s
mind
in
another
age
and
under
different
conditions
drummond
would
have
been
a
pirate
if
it
had
been
any
other
house
than
mine
he
began
and
you
had
not
been
a
fellow
clubman
an
unexpected
call
like
this
might
look
a
little
difficult
of
anthony
trent
acted
his
part
superbly
drunkenness
in
others
had
always
interested
him
drummond
watching
his
vacuous
face
saw
the
inebriated
man
s
groping
for
a
meaning
admirably
portrayed
what
do
yer
mean
simply
this
said
drummond
distinctly
at
a
time
when
i
am
supposed
to
be
in
bed
you
creep
into
my
house
without
knocking
or
ringing
you
come
straight
into
a
room
where
very
valuable
property
is
while
i
personally
believe
your
story
i
doubt
whether
the
police
would
they
are
taught
to
be
suspicious
there
would
be
a
lot
of
scandal
your
mother
for
instance
would
be
upset
new
york
papers
revel
in
that
sort
of
thing
you
have
suppressed
news
in
boston
papers
but
that
doesn
t
go
he
nodded
his
head
impressively
i
wouldn
t
like
to
wager
that
the
police
would
be
convinced
in
fact
it
might
take
a
lot
of
publicity
before
you
satisfied
the
new
york
the
idea
seemed
to
amuse
the
younger
man
let
s
call
em
up
and
see
he
suggested
and
made
a
lurching
step
toward
the
phone
no
no
the
other
exclaimed
hastily
i
wouldn
t
have
that
happen
for
the
over
his
visitor
s
face
drummond
could
see
a
look
of
laboring
comprehension
gradually
stealing
it
was
succeeded
by
a
frown
an
idea
had
been
born
which
was
soon
to
flower
in
high
and
righteous
anger
you
re
a
damned
old
blackmailer
cried
anthony
trent
struggling
to
his
feet
when
a
gentleman
comes
to
apologize
you
call
him
a
robber
i
m
going
drummond
stood
over
him
threatening
and
powerful
i
don
t
know
that
i
shall
let
you
he
said
unpleasantly
why
should
i
you
are
so
drunk
that
in
the
morning
you
won
t
remember
a
word
i
ve
said
to
you
i
m
going
to
make
use
of
you
you
young
whelp
you
ve
delivered
yourself
into
my
hands
if
i
were
to
shoot
you
for
a
burglar
i
should
only
get
commended
for
like
hell
you
would
trent
chuckled
that
old
girl
with
the
caviare
sandwiches
would
tell
the
jury
we
were
conversing
amiably
you
d
swing
for
it
drummond
old
dear
and
i
d
come
to
see
your
melancholy
and
there
s
another
thing
drummond
reminded
him
you
ve
got
a
bad
record
your
father
didn
t
give
up
the
somerset
club
because
he
liked
the
new
york
ones
any
better
they
wanted
to
get
you
away
from
certain
influences
there
i
ve
got
your
whole
haven
t
you
anything
to
drink
anthony
trent
demanded
from
a
cupboard
in
his
black
walnut
desk
drummond
took
a
large
silver
flask
he
did
not
want
his
guest
to
become
too
sober
since
it
was
the
first
drink
that
anthony
trent
had
taken
that
night
he
gulped
eagerly
good
old
henessey
he
murmured
henessey
s
a
gentleman
he
added
pointedly
look
here
said
drummond
presently
after
deep
thought
you
ve
got
to
go
home
i
m
told
there
s
a
butler
who
fetches
you
from
any
low
dive
you
may
happen
to
he
hates
it
trent
chuckled
he
s
a
prohibitionist
i
made
him
drummond
came
over
to
him
and
looked
him
clear
in
the
eye
what
s
your
telephone
number
he
snapped
trent
was
too
careful
a
craftsman
to
be
caught
like
that
he
flung
the
bulstrode
number
back
in
a
flash
ring
him
up
he
commanded
there
s
a
direct
wire
to
his
room
after
what
s
his
name
drummond
asked
old
man
afraid
of
his
wife
he
was
told
kinney
had
told
him
of
the
nickname
young
bulstrode
had
given
the
butler
drummond
flushed
angrily
his
real
name
i
m
not
nor
am
i
trent
observed
i
always
call
him
he
put
on
an
expression
of
obstinacy
that
s
all
i
ll
tell
you
give
me
the
phone
and
let
me
it
was
a
bad
moment
for
anthony
trent
it
was
probable
that
william
drummond
was
going
to
call
up
the
bulstrode
residence
to
make
certain
that
his
visitor
was
indeed
graham
bulstrode
and
if
the
butler
were
to
inform
him
that
the
heir
already
snored
in
his
own
bed
there
must
come
the
sudden
physical
struggle
and
drummond
was
armed
he
had
not
failed
to
observe
that
the
door
to
the
entrance
hall
was
locked
when
drummond
had
spoken
to
the
servant
outside
he
had
taken
this
precaution
for
a
moment
trent
entertained
the
idea
of
springing
at
the
banker
as
he
stood
irresolutely
with
the
telephone
in
his
hand
but
he
abandoned
it
that
would
be
to
bring
things
to
a
head
and
to
wait
might
bring
safety
but
he
was
sufficiently
sure
of
himself
to
be
amused
when
he
heard
drummond
hesitatingly
ask
if
he
were
speaking
to
old
man
afraid
of
his
wife
the
banker
hastily
disclaimed
any
intention
of
being
offensive
mr
graham
bulstrode
is
with
me
he
informed
the
listener
and
that
is
the
only
name
he
would
give
i
am
particularly
anxious
that
you
inform
his
father
i
am
bringing
him
home
also
his
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
i
must
speak
to
bulstrode
when
i
come
i
shall
be
there
within
half
an
hour
he
will
be
sorry
all
his
days
if
he
refuses
to
see
as
he
hung
up
the
instrument
he
noted
with
pleasure
that
young
bulstrode
was
conversing
amicably
with
his
old
friend
henessey
whose
brandy
is
famous
drummond
had
mapped
it
all
out
he
would
not
stay
to
dress
over
his
dressing
gown
he
would
pull
an
automobile
duster
as
though
he
had
been
suddenly
disturbed
he
would
accuse
graham
of
breaking
in
to
steal
he
would
remind
the
chastened
father
of
several
boston
scandals
he
could
see
the
back
bay
blue
blood
beg
for
mercy
and
the
end
of
it
would
be
that
in
the
society
columns
of
the
new
york
dailies
it
would
be
announced
that
and
william
drummond
had
dined
with
and
clent
bulstrode
no
taxi
was
in
sight
when
they
came
down
the
steps
to
the
silent
street
drummond
was
in
an
amazing
good
humor
his
captor
was
now
reduced
through
his
friendship
with
henessey
to
a
silent
phase
of
his
failing
he
clung
tightly
to
the
banker
s
stalwart
arm
and
only
twice
attempted
to
break
into
song
since
the
distance
was
not
great
the
two
walked
trent
looked
anxiously
at
every
man
they
met
when
they
neared
the
bulstrode
mansion
he
feared
to
meet
a
man
of
his
own
build
wearing
a
silk
lined
inverness
cape
it
may
be
wondered
why
anthony
trent
fleet
of
foot
and
in
the
shadow
of
the
park
across
which
his
modest
apartment
lay
did
not
trip
up
the
banker
and
make
his
easy
escape
the
answer
lies
in
the
fact
that
trent
was
not
an
ordinary
breaker
of
the
law
and
also
that
he
had
conceived
a
very
real
dislike
to
william
drummond
his
person
his
character
and
his
aspirations
he
was
determined
that
drummond
should
ride
for
a
fall
a
tired
looking
man
yawning
from
lack
of
sleep
let
them
into
the
house
it
was
a
residence
twice
the
size
of
drummond
s
the
banker
peered
about
the
vast
hall
gloomy
in
the
darkness
in
fancy
he
could
see
drummond
sweeping
through
it
on
her
way
to
dinner
mr
bulstrode
is
in
the
library
he
said
acidly
that
another
should
dare
to
use
a
nickname
that
fitted
him
so
aptly
filled
him
with
indignation
he
barely
glanced
at
the
man
noisily
climbing
the
stairs
to
his
bedroom
the
man
who
had
coined
the
opprobrious
phrase
drummond
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
clent
bulstrode
the
bostonian
was
a
tall
man
with
a
cold
face
and
a
great
opinion
of
his
social
responsibilities
the
only
new
yorkers
he
cared
to
know
were
those
after
whose
families
downtown
streets
had
been
named
i
am
not
in
the
habit
sir
he
began
icily
of
being
summoned
from
my
bed
at
this
time
of
night
to
talk
to
a
stranger
i
don
t
like
it
dummles
drummond
his
visitor
corrected
the
same
thing
cried
bulstrode
i
know
no
one
bearing
either
name
i
can
only
hope
your
errand
is
justified
i
am
informed
it
has
to
do
with
my
you
know
it
has
drummond
retorted
he
broke
into
my
house
and
he
came
curiously
enough
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
deal
of
loose
cash
in
my
room
bulstrode
has
he
done
that
before
if
he
has
i
m
afraid
he
could
get
into
trouble
if
i
informed
the
it
was
a
triumphant
moment
when
he
saw
a
look
of
fear
pass
over
bulstrode
s
contemptuous
countenance
it
was
a
notable
hit
you
wouldn
t
do
that
he
cried
that
depends
drummond
answered
upon
what
it
depended
clent
bulstrode
never
knew
for
there
came
the
noise
of
an
automobile
stopping
outside
the
door
there
was
a
honking
of
the
horn
and
the
confused
sound
of
many
voices
talking
at
once
drummond
followed
the
bostonian
through
the
great
hall
to
the
open
door
they
could
see
old
man
afraid
of
his
wife
assisting
a
young
inebriate
in
evening
dress
and
his
inverness
cape
was
lined
with
white
silk
and
over
his
eyes
an
opera
hat
was
pulled
the
chauffeur
alone
was
sober
he
touched
his
hat
when
he
saw
bulstrode
where
have
you
come
from
he
demanded
i
took
the
gentlemen
to
new
haven
he
said
has
my
son
been
with
you
all
the
evening
yes
sir
the
chauffeur
returned
drummond
his
hopes
dashed
followed
bulstrode
to
the
library
now
said
the
clubman
sneering
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
your
explanation
of
your
slander
of
my
son
in
the
morning
i
can
promise
you
my
lawyers
will
attend
to
it
in
i
was
deceived
the
wretched
drummond
sought
to
explain
a
man
dressed
like
your
son
whom
i
know
by
sight
came
in
and
he
went
through
the
whole
business
by
this
time
the
butler
was
standing
at
the
open
door
listening
i
can
only
say
bulstrode
remarked
that
these
excuses
you
offer
so
glibly
will
be
excuses
cried
the
other
goaded
to
anger
excuses
i
ll
have
you
know
that
a
father
with
a
son
like
yours
is
more
in
need
of
excuses
than
i
he
turned
his
head
to
see
the
butler
entering
the
room
there
was
an
unpleasant
expression
on
the
man
s
face
which
left
him
vaguely
uneasy
show
this
person
out
said
bulstrode
in
his
most
forbidding
manner
wait
a
minute
drummond
commanded
you
owe
it
to
me
to
have
this
house
searched
we
all
saw
that
impostor
go
upstairs
for
all
we
know
he
s
in
hiding
this
very
you
needn
t
worry
old
man
afraid
of
his
wife
observed
he
went
out
just
before
graham
came
back
in
the
motor
i
was
going
to
see
what
it
was
when
the
car
came
between
the
man
turned
to
clent
bulstrode
it
s
my
belief
sir
they
re
what
makes
you
say
that
demanded
his
master
he
could
see
an
unusual
expression
of
triumph
in
the
butler
s
eye
the
black
pearl
stick
pin
that
graham
values
so
much
has
been
stolen
from
his
what
have
i
to
do
with
that
drummond
shouted
simply
this
the
other
returned
that
you
introduced
this
criminal
to
my
house
and
i
shall
expect
you
to
make
good
what
your
friend
friend
repeated
the
outraged
drummond
my
friend
it
is
a
matter
for
the
police
bulstrode
yawned
drummond
watched
his
tall
thin
figure
ascending
the
stairs
plainly
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
go
never
in
his
full
life
had
things
broken
so
badly
for
william
drummond
he
could
feel
the
butler
s
baleful
stare
as
he
slowly
crossed
the
great
hall
he
felt
he
hated
the
man
who
had
witnessed
his
defeat
and
laughed
at
his
humiliation
and
drummond
was
not
used
to
the
contempt
of
underlings
yet
the
butler
had
the
last
word
as
he
closed
the
door
he
flung
a
contemptuous
after
the
banker
he
said
old
man
afraid
of
the
a
broken
and
dispirited
man
william
drummond
banker
came
to
his
own
house
the
pockets
in
which
he
had
placed
his
keys
were
empty
there
was
no
hole
by
which
they
might
have
been
lost
and
he
had
not
removed
the
long
duster
only
one
man
could
have
taken
them
he
called
to
mind
how
the
staggering
creature
who
claimed
to
be
graham
bulstrode
had
again
and
again
clutched
at
him
for
support
and
if
he
had
taken
them
to
what
use
had
they
been
put
it
seemed
he
must
have
waited
half
an
hour
before
a
sleepy
servant
let
him
in
drummond
pushed
by
him
with
an
oath
and
went
hastily
to
the
black
walnut
desk
there
seemingly
unmoved
was
the
paper
that
he
had
pulled
over
the
notes
when
the
unknown
came
into
the
room
it
was
when
he
raised
it
to
see
what
lay
beneath
that
he
understood
to
the
full
what
a
costly
night
it
had
been
for
him
across
one
of
his
own
envelopes
was
scrawled

single

chapter
vii
the
danger
of
sentiment
after
leaving
drummond
s
house
anthony
trent
started
without
intemperate
haste
for
his
comfortable
apartment
in
accordance
with
his
instructions
kinney
retired
not
later
than
ten
there
might
come
a
night
when
he
needed
to
prove
the
alibi
that
she
could
unconsciously
nullify
if
she
waited
up
for
him
in
these
early
days
of
his
career
he
was
not
much
in
fear
of
detection
and
approached
his
door
with
little
of
the
trepidation
he
was
to
experience
later
when
his
name
was
unknown
still
but
his
reputation
exceedingly
high
with
the
police
later
he
knew
he
must
arrange
his
mode
of
life
with
greater
care
new
york
for
example
is
not
an
easy
city
for
a
man
fleeing
from
police
pursuit
its
brilliant
lighting
its
sleeplessness
the
rectangular
blocks
and
absence
of
helpful
back
alleys
all
these
were
aids
to
the
law
abiding
he
had
not
chosen
his
location
heedlessly
from
the
roof
on
which
he
often
slept
he
could
see
five
feet
distant
from
its
boundary
the
wall
that
circumscribed
the
top
of
another
house
such
as
his
but
having
its
entrance
on
a
side
street
it
would
not
be
hard
to
get
a
key
to
fit
the
front
door
and
since
he
would
make
use
of
it
infrequently
and
then
only
late
at
night
there
was
little
risk
of
detection
thinking
several
moves
ahead
of
his
game
was
one
of
trent
s
means
to
insure
success
he
must
have
some
plausible
excuse
in
case
he
were
caught
upon
the
roof
the
excuse
that
suggested
itself
instantly
was
a
cat
he
bought
a
large
and
frolicsome
cat
and
a
stealthy
hunter
by
night
and
introduced
him
to
kinney
that
excellent
woman
was
not
pleased
a
cat
she
asserted
needed
a
garden
exactly
agreed
her
employer
a
roof
so
it
was
that
agrippa
joined
the
household
and
sought
to
prey
upon
twittering
sparrows
and
since
agrippa
looking
seventy
feet
below
was
not
in
fear
of
falling
he
leaped
the
intermediate
distance
between
the
roofs
and
was
rewarded
with
a
sparrow
thereafter
he
used
what
roof
offered
the
best
hunting
two
maiden
ladies
occupied
the
topmost
flat
the
misses
sawyer
and
were
startled
one
evening
at
a
knock
upon
their
door
an
affable
young
gentleman
begged
permission
to
retrieve
his
cat
from
their
roof
the
hunting
agrippa
had
sprung
the
dreadful
space
and
feared
he
asserted
plausibly
to
get
back
the
misses
sawyer
loved
cats
it
seemed
but
had
none
now
fearing
to
seem
disloyal
to
the
memory
of
a
peerless
beast
about
whom
they
could
not
talk
without
eyes
they
told
their
neighbor
cordially
that
whenever
agrippa
strayed
again
he
was
to
make
free
of
the
roof
ring
our
bell
said
one
of
them
and
we
ll
let
you
but
how
did
you
get
in
the
other
sister
demanded
suddenly
the
door
was
open
he
said
blandly
that
s
that
dreadful
dietz
again
they
cried
in
unison
he
drinks
and
when
he
goes
out
to
the
saloon
he
puts
the
catch
back
so
there
won
t
be
the
bother
of
a
key
i
have
complained
but
the
janitor
takes
no
notice
i
suppose
we
don
t
offer
him
cigars
and
tips
so
he
takes
the
part
of
by
this
simple
maneuver
anthony
trent
established
his
right
to
use
the
roof
without
incurring
suspicion
the
drummond
loot
proved
not
to
be
despised
by
one
anxious
to
put
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
his
credit
the
actual
amount
was
three
thousand
eight
hundred
dollars
furthermore
there
was
some
of
the
drummond
stationery
a
bundle
of
letters
and
the
two
or
three
things
he
had
taken
hastily
from
young
bulstrode
s
room
he
regretted
there
had
been
so
small
an
opportunity
to
investigate
the
bulstrode
mansion
but
time
had
too
great
a
value
for
him
the
black
pearl
had
flung
itself
at
him
and
some
yale
keys
and
assorted
club
stationery
these
were
all
he
could
take
the
stationery
might
prove
useful
he
had
discovered
that
fact
in
the
conington
warren
affair
if
it
had
not
been
that
the
butler
crept
out
of
the
dark
hall
to
watch
him
as
he
left
the
bulstrode
house
he
would
have
tried
the
keys
on
the
hall
door
that
could
be
done
later
it
is
not
every
rich
house
which
is
guarded
by
burglar
resisting
devices
it
was
the
bundle
of
letters
and
s
that
he
examined
with
peculiar
care
they
were
enclosed
in
a
long
blue
envelope
on
which
was
written
private
and
when
trent
had
read
them
all
he
whistled
these
will
be
worth
ten
times
his
measly
hundred
he
said
softly
but
there
was
no
thought
of
blackmail
in
his
mind
that
was
a
crime
at
which
he
still
wholesomely
rebelled
it
occurred
to
him
sometimes
that
a
life
such
as
his
tended
to
lead
to
progressive
deterioration
that
there
might
come
a
time
when
he
would
no
longer
feel
bitterly
toward
blackmailers
it
was
part
of
his
punishment
this
dismal
thought
of
what
might
be
unless
he
reverted
to
the
ways
of
honest
men
inasmuch
as
a
man
may
play
a
crooked
game
decently
so
anthony
trent
determined
to
play
it
many
of
the
letters
in
the
blue
envelope
were
from
women
whose
names
were
easily
within
the
ken
of
one
who
studied
the
society
columns
of
the
metropolitan
dailies
most
of
them
seemed
to
have
been
the
victims
of
misplaced
bets
at
belmont
park
or
rash
bidding
at
auction
there
was
one
letter
from
the
wife
of
a
high
official
at
washington
begging
him
on
no
account
to
let
her
husband
know
she
had
borrowed
money
from
him
a
prominent
society
golfing
girl
whose
play
trent
had
a
score
of
times
admired
for
its
pluck
and
skill
had
borrowed
a
thousand
dollars
from
drummond
there
was
her
on
the
table
scrawling
a
line
on
drummond
stationery
in
what
seemed
to
be
drummond
handwriting
anthony
trent
sent
it
back
to
her
there
were
acknowledgments
of
borrowings
from
the
same
kind
of
rich
waster
that
graham
bulstrode
represented
a
score
of
prominent
persons
would
have
slept
the
better
for
knowing
that
their
s
had
passed
from
drummond
s
keeping
the
man
was
more
of
a
usurer
than
banker
what
interested
anthony
trent
most
of
all
was
a
collection
of
letters
signed
and
written
on
the
stationery
of
a
very
exclusive
club
it
was
a
club
to
which
drummond
did
not
belong
the
first
letter
was
merely
a
request
that
drummond
meet
the
writer
in
the
library
of
the
athletic
club
where
anthony
trent
had
seen
him
the
second
was
longer
and
spelled
a
deeper
distress
it
s
impossible
in
a
case
like
this
wrote
to
get
any
man
i
know
well
to
endorse
my
note
if
i
could
afford
to
let
all
the
world
into
my
secret
i
should
not
have
come
to
you
you
know
very
well
that
as
i
am
the
only
son
your
money
is
safe
enough
i
must
pay
this
girl
fifty
thousand
dollars
or
let
my
father
know
all
about
it
he
would
be
angry
enough
to
send
me
to
some
ranch
to
cut
wild
the
third
letter
was
still
more
insistent
the
writer
was
obviously
afraid
that
he
would
have
to
beg
the
money
from
his
father
i
have
always
understood
he
wrote
that
you
would
lend
any
amount
on
reasonable
security
i
want
only
fifty
thousand
dollars
but
i
ve
got
to
have
it
at
once
it
s
quite
beyond
my
mother
s
power
to
get
it
for
me
this
time
i
ve
been
to
that
source
too
often
and
the
old
man
is
on
to
it
insists
that
the
money
in
cash
must
be
paid
to
her
on
the
morning
of
the
when
she
will
call
at
the
house
with
her
lawyer
i
am
to
receive
my
letters
back
and
she
will
leave
new
york
let
me
know
the
next
letter
indicated
that
william
drummond
had
decided
to
lend
the
amount
but
that
his
offer
came
too
late
i
wish
you
had
made
up
your
mind
sooner
said
it
would
have
saved
me
the
devil
of
a
lot
of
worry
and
you
could
have
made
money
out
of
it
as
it
is
my
father
learned
of
it
somehow
he
talked
about
the
family
honor
as
usual
but
the
result
is
that
when
she
and
her
lawyer
call
at
ten
on
thursday
morning
the
money
will
be
there
no
check
for
her
she
s
far
too
clever
but
fifty
thousand
in
crisp
new
notes
as
for
me
i
m
to
reform
that
means
i
have
to
go
down
town
every
morning
at
nine
and
work
in
my
father
s
brokerage
business
can
you
imagine
me
doing
that
i
blame
you
for
it
drummond
you
are
too
cautious
by
a
damn
sight
to
please
anthony
trent
was
thus
put
into
possession
of
the
following
facts
that
a
rich
man
s
son
initials
only
known
had
got
into
some
sort
of
a
scrape
with
a
girl
initials
were
who
demanded
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
cash
which
was
to
be
paid
at
the
residence
of
the
young
man
s
father
the
date
set
was
thursday
the
eighteenth
it
was
now
the
early
morning
of
tuesday
the
sixteenth
trent
had
lists
of
the
members
of
all
the
best
clubs
he
went
through
the
one
on
whose
paper
had
written
there
were
several
members
with
those
initials
careful
elimination
left
him
with
only
one
likely
name
that
of
norton
guestwick
norton
guestwick
was
the
only
son
and
heir
of
a
very
rich
broker
the
elder
guestwick
posed
as
a
musical
critic
had
a
box
in
the
golden
horseshoe
and
patronized
such
opera
singers
as
permitted
it
many
a
time
anthony
trent
had
gazed
on
the
guestwick
family
seated
in
their
compelling
box
from
the
modest
seat
that
was
his
guestwick
had
even
written
a
book
operas
i
have
seen
which
might
be
found
in
most
public
libraries
it
was
an
elaborately
illustrated
tome
which
reflected
his
shortcomings
as
a
critic
no
less
than
his
vanity
as
an
author
a
collector
of
musical
books
trent
remembered
buying
it
with
high
hopes
and
being
disgusted
at
its
smug
ineffectiveness
he
had
seldom
seen
norton
in
the
family
box
but
the
girls
were
seldom
absent
they
too
upheld
the
arts
long
ago
he
had
conceived
a
dislike
for
guestwick
he
hated
men
who
beat
what
they
thought
was
time
to
music
whose
composers
had
other
ideas
of
it
turning
up
a
recent
file
of
he
came
upon
a
reference
to
the
guestwick
heir
we
understand
said
this
waspish
but
usually
veracious
weekly
that
norton
guestwick
s
attention
to
pretty
estelle
grandcourt
née
sadie
cort
has
much
perturbed
his
aristocratic
parents
who
wish
him
to
marry
a
snug
fortune
and
a
girl
suited
to
be
their
it
is
not
violating
a
confidence
to
say
that
the
lady
in
question
occupies
a
mansion
on
commonwealth
avenue
and
is
one
of
the
most
popular
girls
in
boston
s
smart
while
many
commentators
will
puzzle
themselves
over
the
identity
of
the
dark
lady
of
the
immortal
sonnets
few
could
have
failed
to
perceive
that
was
almost
certain
to
be
estelle
grandcourt
sundry
tests
of
a
confirmatory
nature
proved
it
without
doubt
he
had
thus
two
days
in
which
to
make
his
preparations
to
annex
the
fifty
thousand
dollars
there
were
difficulties
in
these
early
days
of
his
adventuring
anthony
trent
made
no
use
of
disguises
he
had
so
far
been
but
himself
vaguely
he
admitted
that
he
must
sooner
or
later
come
to
veiling
his
identity
for
the
present
exploit
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
find
out
the
name
of
the
guestwick
butler
he
might
have
to
get
particulars
from
clarke
but
even
clarke
s
help
could
not
now
be
called
in
and
it
was
upon
this
seemingly
unimportant
thing
that
his
plan
hinged
in
a
disguise
such
as
many
celebrated
cracksmen
had
used
he
might
have
gained
a
kitchen
door
and
learned
by
what
name
guestwick
s
man
called
himself
or
he
might
have
found
it
out
from
a
tradesman
s
lad
but
to
ask
as
anthony
trent
what
might
link
him
with
a
robbery
was
too
risky
unfortunately
for
charles
newman
guestwick
his
book
which
had
cost
trent
two
dollars
and
was
thrown
aside
as
worthless
supplied
the
key
to
what
was
needed
it
was
the
wordy
garrulous
book
that
only
a
author
might
write
and
have
published
the
first
chapter
my
childhood
was
succeeded
by
a
lofty
disquisition
on
music
later
there
came
revelations
of
the
guestwick
family
life
with
portraits
of
their
various
homes
the
music
room
had
a
chapter
to
itself
reading
on
anthony
trent
came
to
the
chapter
headed
rather
cryptically
after
the
it
is
my
custom
wrote
the
excellent
guestwick
to
hold
in
my
box
an
informal
reception
after
the
performance
is
ended
my
wide
knowledge
of
music
of
singers
and
their
several
abilities
lends
me
i
venture
to
say
a
unique
position
among
amateurs
we
rarely
sup
at
hotel
or
restaurant
after
the
performance
in
my
library
where
there
is
also
a
grand
piano
we
have
three
such
instruments
in
our
new
york
home
and
two
more
at
lenox
guestwick
and
my
daughters
talk
over
what
we
have
heard
criticizing
here
lauding
there
until
a
simple
repast
is
served
by
the
butler
who
always
waits
up
for
us
the
rest
of
the
servants
have
long
since
retired
my
library
consists
of
perhaps
the
most
valuable
collection
of
musical
literature
in
the
world
i
have
mentioned
in
another
chapter
the
refining
influence
of
music
on
persons
of
little
education
john
briggs
my
butler
is
a
case
in
point
he
came
to
me
from
lord
fitzhosken
s
place
in
northamptonshire
england
the
fitzhoskens
are
immemoriably
associated
with
and
the
and
all
briggs
heard
there
in
the
way
of
music
were
the
cheerful
rollicking
songs
of
the
hunt
breakfast
i
sent
him
to
see
götterdämmerung
he
told
me
simply
that
it
was
a
revelation
to
him
he
doubted
in
his
uneducated
way
whether
wagner
himself
comprehended
what
he
had
there
were
thirty
other
chapters
in
guestwick
s
book
in
all
he
revealed
himself
as
a
pompous
ass
assured
only
of
tolerance
among
a
people
where
money
consciousness
had
succeeded
that
of
caste
but
anthony
trent
felt
kindly
toward
him
and
the
money
he
had
spent
was
likely
to
earn
him
big
dividends
if
things
went
well
caruso
sang
on
the
night
preceding
the
morning
on
which
estelle
grandcourt
was
to
appear
and
claim
her
heart
balm
this
meant
a
large
attendance
for
tenors
may
come
and
go
press
agents
may
announce
other
golden
voiced
singers
but
caruso
holds
his
pride
of
place
honestly
won
and
generously
maintained
it
had
been
trent
s
experience
that
the
guestwicks
rarely
missed
a
big
night
it
was
at
half
past
nine
anthony
trent
groaned
that
a
professional
engagement
compelled
him
to
leave
the
metropolitan
he
had
spent
money
on
a
seat
not
this
time
for
an
evening
of
enjoyment
but
to
make
certain
that
the
guestwicks
were
in
their
box
there
was
charles
newman
guestwick
beating
false
time
with
a
pudgy
hand
his
lady
weighted
with
guestwick
jewels
tried
to
create
the
impression
that
after
all
caruso
owed
much
of
his
success
to
her
amiable
patronage
the
two
daughters
upheld
the
guestwick
tradition
by
being
exceedingly
affable
to
those
greater
than
they
and
using
lorgnettes
to
those
who
strove
to
know
the
guestwicks
john
briggs
drinking
a
mug
of
ale
and
wondering
who
was
winning
a
light
weight
contest
at
the
national
sporting
club
was
resting
in
his
he
liked
these
long
opera
evenings
which
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
rest
as
much
as
he
despised
his
employer
for
his
inordinate
attendance
at
these
meaningless
entertainments
he
shuddered
as
he
remembered
the
twilight
of
the
at
ten
o
clock
when
briggs
was
nodding
in
his
chair
the
telephone
bell
rang
over
the
wire
came
his
employer
s
voice
it
was
not
without
purpose
that
anthony
trent
s
unusual
skill
in
mimicry
had
been
employed
as
a
youth
he
had
acquired
a
reputation
in
his
home
town
for
imitations
of
henry
irving
bryan
otis
skinner
and
their
like
is
this
you
briggs
demanded
the
supposed
guestwick
yes
sir
returned
briggs
i
wish
you
to
listen
carefully
to
my
instructions
he
was
commanded
they
are
very
certainly
sir
the
man
returned
he
sensed
a
something
almost
agitation
in
the
usually
placid
voice
i
hope
there
s
nothing
serious
there
may
be
the
other
said
that
i
can
t
say
yet
see
that
every
one
goes
to
bed
but
you
send
them
off
at
once
you
must
remain
up
until
a
man
in
evening
dress
comes
to
the
front
door
and
demands
admittance
it
will
be
a
detective
show
him
at
once
to
the
library
and
leave
him
absolutely
undisturbed
absolutely
undisturbed
briggs
do
you
understand
i
ll
do
as
you
say
sir
briggs
answered
troubled
he
was
sure
now
that
serious
sinister
things
were
afoot
and
wished
the
guestwicks
had
been
as
well
disposed
to
dogs
in
the
house
as
had
been
that
hard
drinking
reckless
lord
fitzhosken
suddenly
an
important
thought
came
to
him
is
there
any
way
of
making
sure
that
the
man
who
comes
is
the
detective
i
am
glad
you
are
so
shrewd
briggs
said
the
millionaire
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
that
an
impostor
might
come
say
to
the
man
what
is
your
errand
i
shall
instruct
him
to
answer
i
have
come
to
look
at
guestwick
s
rare
very
good
sir
said
briggs
unless
he
answers
that
do
not
admit
him
you
understand
perfectly
the
butler
made
answer
at
half
past
ten
a
man
in
evening
dress
rang
the
door
of
the
guestwick
mansion
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
hard
look
and
a
biting
gruff
voice
briggs
interposed
his
sturdy
body
between
the
stranger
and
the
entrance
what
is
your
errand
said
briggs
suavely
i
have
come
to
look
at
guestwick
s
rare
editions
he
was
told
step
inside
urged
briggs
with
cordiality
everybody
in
bed
the
man
snapped
except
me
said
the
butler
any
one
here
except
the
servants
we
have
no
house
guests
said
briggs
we
don
t
keep
a
deal
of
show
me
to
the
library
the
stranger
commanded
briggs
now
stately
and
offended
led
the
way
briggs
resented
the
tone
the
detective
used
in
his
youth
the
butler
had
been
handy
with
the
gloves
it
was
for
this
reason
he
was
taken
into
service
by
the
nobleman
so
that
he
might
box
with
his
lordship
every
day
before
breakfast
briggs
would
have
liked
the
opportunity
to
put
on
the
gloves
with
this
frowning
overbearing
hawknosed
detective
you
ve
got
your
orders
cried
the
stranger
i
have
briggs
answered
a
trace
of
insolence
perceptible
then
get
out
and
don
t
worry
me
remember
this
answer
no
phone
messages
or
door
bells
my
men
outside
will
attend
to
the
people
who
want
to
get
into
this
briggs
tried
new
tactics
he
was
feverishly
anxious
to
find
out
what
was
suspected
as
man
to
man
briggs
began
with
a
fine
affability
imperiously
he
was
ordered
from
the
room
anthony
trent
sank
into
a
chair
and
laughed
gently
it
had
all
been
so
absurdly
easy
two
good
hours
were
before
him
none
would
interrupt
it
was
known
that
young
norton
had
been
bundled
out
of
town
until
his
charmer
had
disappeared
had
told
him
so
much
it
was
almost
certain
that
the
guestwicks
would
not
return
to
their
home
until
half
past
twelve
that
would
give
him
a
sufficient
time
to
examine
every
likely
looking
place
in
the
house
the
old
time
crook
would
no
doubt
have
hit
briggs
over
the
head
with
a
black
jack
and
run
a
risk
in
the
doing
of
it
the
representative
of
the
newer
school
had
simply
sent
all
the
servants
to
bed
looking
quickly
about
the
great
apartment
and
imposing
trent
s
eyes
fell
on
an
edition
in
twenty
fat
volumes
of
s
encyclopædia
of
music
and
scrutiny
told
the
observer
that
behind
these
fake
books
there
was
a
safe
it
was
an
old
dodge
this
if
the
money
for
miss
grandcourt
was
not
here
there
were
no
doubt
negotiable
papers
and
jewels
this
was
just
the
sort
of
spot
where
valuables
might
be
laid
away
to
pry
open
the
glass
door
of
the
book
case
roll
back
the
works
of
the
unknown
penroy
and
come
face
to
face
with
the
old
fashioned
safe
took
less
than
two
minutes
it
was
amazing
that
so
shrewd
a
man
as
guestwick
must
be
in
business
matters
should
rely
on
this
it
was
rather
that
he
relied
on
the
integrity
of
his
servants
and
an
efficient
system
of
burglar
alarm
from
the
cane
that
anthony
trent
had
carelessly
thrown
on
a
chair
he
took
some
finely
tempered
steel
drills
and
presently
assembled
the
tools
necessary
to
his
task
as
a
boy
he
had
been
the
rare
kind
who
could
take
a
watch
apart
and
put
it
together
again
and
have
no
parts
left
over
it
was
largely
owing
to
an
inborn
mechanical
skill
that
he
had
persuaded
himself
he
could
make
good
at
his
calling
it
was
striking
eleven
by
the
ship
s
clock
six
bells
when
he
rolled
the
doors
open
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
stretched
kneeling
before
the
safe
had
cramped
his
muscles
sinking
into
a
big
black
leathern
chair
he
contemplated
the
strong
box
that
was
now
at
his
mercy
he
allowed
himself
the
luxury
of
a
cigarette
there
passed
before
his
mind
s
eye
a
vista
of
pleasant
shaded
pools
wherein
big
trout
were
lying
weems
did
not
own
the
only
desirable
camp
on
kennebago
he
was
suddenly
called
back
from
this
dreaming
this
to
a
realization
that
such
prospects
might
never
be
his
it
was
the
low
pleasant
tones
of
a
cultivated
woman
s
voice
which
wrought
the
amazing
change
i
suppose
you
re
a
burglar
the
voice
said
there
was
no
trace
of
nervousness
in
her
tone
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
looked
around
not
twenty
feet
distant
he
saw
her
she
was
a
tall
graceful
girl
about
or
three
clad
in
a
charming
evening
gown
over
her
white
arm
trailed
a
fur
cloak
costly
and
elegant
and
although
the
moment
was
hardly
one
for
thinking
of
female
charms
he
was
struck
by
her
unusual
beauty
she
possessed
an
air
of
extreme
sophistication
and
stood
looking
at
him
as
if
the
man
before
her
were
some
unusual
and
bizarre
specimen
of
his
kind
chapter
viii
when
a
woman
smiled
anthony
trent
apparently
was
in
no
way
confused
at
this
interruption
the
woman
was
not
to
guess
that
his
manner
and
the
careless
lighting
of
a
cigarette
cloaked
in
reality
a
feeling
of
despair
at
the
untoward
ending
of
his
adventure
calmly
she
walked
past
him
and
looked
at
the
assemblage
of
finely
tempered
steel
instruments
of
his
profession
so
you
re
a
burglar
she
said
with
an
air
of
decision
that
is
a
term
i
dislike
said
anthony
trent
genially
call
me
rather
a
professional
collector
an
abstractor
a
connoisseur
anything
but
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing
she
returned
severely
you
came
here
to
steal
my
father
s
your
father
s
money
he
returned
slowly
then
then
you
are
miss
guestwick
naturally
she
retorted
eyeing
him
keenly
and
if
you
offer
any
violence
i
shall
have
you
she
was
amazed
to
see
a
pleasant
smile
break
over
the
intruder
s
face
he
was
exceedingly
attractive
when
he
smiled
what
a
hard
heart
you
have
you
ought
to
realize
this
is
no
time
to
jest
she
said
stiffly
i
am
not
so
sure
he
made
answer
she
looked
at
him
haughtily
he
realized
that
he
had
rarely
seen
so
beautiful
a
girl
there
was
a
look
of
high
courage
about
her
that
particularly
appealed
to
him
she
had
long
oriental
eyes
of
jade
green
he
amended
his
guess
as
to
her
age
she
must
be
seven
and
twenty
he
told
himself
it
is
my
duty
to
call
the
police
and
have
you
arrested
she
exclaimed
that
is
the
usual
procedure
he
agreed
she
stood
there
irresolute
i
wonder
what
makes
you
steal
abstract
he
corrected
collect
borrow
annex
but
not
she
took
no
notice
of
his
interruption
it
isn
t
as
though
you
were
ill
or
starving
that
might
be
some
sort
of
excuse
but
you
are
well
dressed
i
ve
done
a
great
deal
of
social
work
among
the
poor
and
often
i
ve
met
the
wives
of
thieves
and
have
actually
found
myself
pitying
men
who
have
stolen
for
jean
valjean
stuff
he
smiled
it
has
elements
of
pathos
jean
got
nineteen
years
for
it
if
you
she
paid
no
heed
to
his
flippancy
you
talk
like
an
educated
man
economic
determination
did
not
bring
you
to
this
you
have
absolutely
no
i
have
offered
none
he
said
drily
she
spoke
with
a
sudden
air
of
candor
do
you
know
this
situation
interests
me
very
much
one
reads
about
burglars
of
course
but
that
sort
of
thing
seems
rather
remote
we
ve
never
had
any
robberies
here
before
and
now
to
come
face
to
face
with
a
real
burglar
cracking
isn
t
that
the
word
you
use
a
safe
is
rather
you
bear
up
remarkably
well
he
assured
her
it
was
her
turn
to
smile
i
m
just
wondering
she
said
slowly
my
father
detests
the
intruder
permitted
himself
to
laugh
gently
he
thought
of
that
pretentious
tome
operas
i
have
how
well
guestwick
conceals
it
apparently
she
had
not
heard
him
it
was
plain
she
was
in
the
throes
of
making
up
her
mind
i
wonder
if
i
ought
to
do
it
she
mused
do
what
he
demanded
let
you
get
away
you
have
so
far
stolen
nothing
so
i
should
not
be
aiding
or
abetting
a
indeed
you
would
he
said
promptly
my
very
presence
here
is
illegal
and
as
you
see
i
have
opened
that
absurd
what
an
amazing
burglar
she
cried
he
does
not
want
his
it
is
your
duty
as
guestwick
s
daughter
to
send
me
to
jail
and
i
shan
t
respect
you
if
you
don
she
was
again
the
haughty
young
society
woman
gazing
at
a
curious
specimen
of
man
it
is
very
evident
she
snapped
that
you
don
t
appreciate
your
position
instead
of
sending
you
to
prison
i
am
willing
to
give
you
another
chance
will
you
promise
me
never
to
do
this
sort
of
thing
again
if
i
let
you
go
trent
looked
up
i
have
enjoyed
your
conversation
very
much
he
observed
genially
but
i
have
work
to
do
inside
that
safe
i
expect
to
find
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
possibly
some
odd
trinkets
i
am
in
particular
need
of
the
money
and
i
propose
to
get
swiftly
she
crossed
the
room
to
a
telephone
i
don
t
think
you
ll
succeed
she
said
her
hand
on
the
instrument
put
it
to
the
test
he
suggested
the
wires
are
not
why
aren
t
you
afraid
she
demanded
don
t
you
realize
your
position
fully
he
retorted
but
remember
you
ll
have
just
the
same
difficulty
as
i
in
explaining
your
presence
here
now
go
ahead
and
get
the
what
do
you
mean
she
cried
he
noticed
that
she
paled
at
what
he
said
and
her
hands
had
been
for
a
moment
not
quite
steady
first
that
you
are
not
a
miss
guestwick
there
are
only
two
of
them
and
i
have
just
left
them
at
the
opera
next
you
are
neither
servant
nor
guest
the
servants
are
all
abed
and
there
are
no
house
guests
i
am
not
accustomed
to
making
mistakes
in
matters
of
this
sort
now
i
m
not
inviting
confidences
and
i
m
not
making
threats
but
the
doors
are
locked
and
i
intend
to
get
what
i
came
for
ring
all
you
like
and
see
if
a
servant
answers
you
by
the
way
how
is
it
i
overlooked
you
when
i
came
in
i
hid
behind
those
it
was
excusable
he
commented
not
to
have
looked
she
sank
into
a
chair
her
whole
face
suffused
with
gloom
he
steeled
his
heart
against
feeling
sympathy
for
her
he
would
liked
to
have
learned
all
about
her
but
there
was
not
much
time
the
guestwicks
might
return
earlier
than
usual
or
briggs
might
be
lurking
the
other
side
of
the
door
you
ve
found
me
out
she
said
quietly
i
m
not
one
of
the
guestwick
i
told
you
so
he
said
a
little
impatiently
don
t
you
want
to
know
anything
about
me
she
demanded
some
other
time
he
returned
i
m
busy
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
i
thought
i
told
you
i
m
going
to
see
what
guestwick
has
which
interests
me
then
i
shall
get
a
bite
to
eat
somewhere
and
go
home
to
are
you
going
to
take
that
fifty
thousand
dollars
she
demanded
her
tone
was
a
tragic
one
that
s
what
i
came
for
he
told
her
you
mustn
t
you
mustn
t
she
declared
and
then
fell
to
weeping
bitterly
beauty
in
distress
moved
anthony
trent
even
when
his
business
most
engrossed
his
attention
it
was
his
nature
to
be
considerate
of
women
when
he
had
garnered
enough
money
to
buy
himself
a
home
he
intended
to
marry
and
settle
down
to
domestic
joys
as
to
this
weeping
woman
there
was
little
doubt
in
his
mind
as
to
the
reason
she
was
in
the
guestwick
home
perhaps
she
noticed
the
harder
look
that
came
to
his
face
whom
do
you
think
i
am
she
asked
i
have
not
forgotten
he
answered
that
women
also
are
abstractors
at
she
gazed
at
him
wide
open
eyes
a
look
of
horror
on
her
face
you
think
i
m
here
to
steal
i
wish
i
didn
t
he
answered
it
s
bad
enough
for
a
man
but
for
a
woman
like
you
what
am
i
to
think
when
i
find
you
hiding
in
a
house
where
you
have
no
right
to
be
that
s
the
whole
tragedy
of
it
she
exclaimed
that
i
ve
no
right
to
be
here
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
everything
can
t
you
guess
who
i
am
anthony
trent
looked
at
the
clock
precious
seconds
were
chasing
one
another
into
minutes
and
he
had
wasted
too
much
time
already
i
don
t
see
that
it
matters
at
all
to
me
he
pointed
to
the
safe
i
m
here
on
it
annoyed
him
to
feel
he
was
not
quite
living
up
to
the
debonair
heroes
he
had
created
once
upon
a
time
they
would
not
have
permitted
themselves
to
be
so
brusque
with
a
lovely
girl
upon
whose
exquisite
cheeks
tears
were
still
wet
you
must
listen
to
me
she
implored
i
m
estelle
grandcourt
now
do
you
understand
why
i
ve
come
for
the
money
that
you
think
is
already
yours
he
said
a
trifle
sulkily
matters
were
becoming
complicated
money
cried
the
amazing
chorus
girl
i
hate
it
his
face
cleared
if
that
s
the
case
he
said
genially
we
shall
not
quarrel
frankly
miss
grandcourt
i
love
she
glanced
at
him
through
lashes
i
suppose
you
ve
always
thought
of
a
show
girl
as
a
scheming
adventuress
always
on
the
lookout
for
some
foolish
rich
old
man
or
else
some
silly
boy
with
millions
to
not
at
all
he
protested
but
you
have
she
contradicted
i
can
tell
by
your
manner
for
my
part
i
have
always
thought
of
burglars
as
brutal
men
without
chivalry
or
courtesy
i
ve
been
wrong
too
i
imagined
the
was
only
a
fiction
and
now
i
find
him
a
fact
will
you
please
tell
me
what
you
ve
heard
about
me
i
m
not
fishing
for
compliments
i
want
really
and
truly
to
trent
hesitated
a
moment
he
thought
as
he
looked
at
her
that
never
had
he
seen
a
sweeter
face
she
was
wholly
in
earnest
please
please
she
entreated
it
s
probably
all
wrong
he
observed
but
the
general
impression
is
that
norton
guestwick
is
a
wild
weak
lad
for
whom
you
set
your
snares
and
when
guestwick
tried
to
break
it
off
you
asked
dollars
in
cash
as
a
do
you
believe
that
she
asked
looking
at
him
almost
piteously
it
was
common
report
he
said
seeking
to
exonerate
himself
i
read
some
of
it
in
and
just
because
of
what
some
spiteful
writer
said
you
condemn
me
he
looked
at
the
inviting
safe
and
fidgeted
i
m
not
condemning
he
reminded
her
i
don
t
know
anything
about
the
affair
i
don
t
yet
see
why
you
are
here
miss
because
i
have
the
right
to
be
she
said
looking
him
full
in
the
face
i
pretended
i
was
a
miss
guestwick
if
you
wish
to
know
the
truth
i
am
norton
guestwick
i
can
show
you
our
marriage
certificate
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
been
in
the
house
of
my
how
did
you
get
in
he
demanded
he
felt
certain
that
briggs
the
butler
had
shown
him
into
the
library
believing
it
to
be
unoccupied
i
bribed
a
servant
who
used
to
be
in
our
your
employ
he
queried
why
not
she
flung
back
at
him
is
it
also
reported
that
i
come
from
the
slums
we
were
never
rich
as
the
guestwicks
are
rich
but
until
my
father
died
we
lived
in
good
style
as
we
know
it
in
the
south
i
am
at
least
as
well
educated
as
my
who
refuse
to
recognize
that
i
exist
i
was
at
the
sacred
heart
convent
in
paris
i
sing
and
paint
and
play
the
piano
as
well
as
most
girls
but
do
none
of
these
well
enough
to
make
a
living
at
it
i
came
here
to
new
york
hoping
that
through
the
influence
of
my
father
s
friends
i
could
get
some
sort
of
a
position
which
would
give
me
a
living
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
wonder
if
you
know
how
differently
people
look
at
one
when
one
is
well
off
and
when
one
comes
begging
favors
none
better
he
exclaimed
bitterly
so
i
had
to
get
in
to
the
chorus
because
they
said
my
figure
would
do
even
if
i
hadn
t
a
good
enough
voice
then
i
met
she
looked
at
anthony
trent
with
a
little
friendly
smile
that
stirred
him
oddly
in
that
moment
he
envied
norton
guestwick
more
than
any
living
creature
what
do
they
say
about
my
husband
she
asked
you
can
never
believe
reports
he
said
evasively
i
ll
tell
you
she
returned
they
say
he
is
a
waster
a
libertine
weak
and
degenerate
they
are
wrong
he
is
full
of
sweet
generous
impulses
his
mother
has
so
pampered
him
that
he
was
almost
hopeless
till
i
met
him
i
expect
you
think
it
s
conceited
of
me
but
i
have
a
great
influence
on
you
would
on
any
man
he
said
fervently
she
looked
at
him
in
a
way
that
suggested
a
certain
subtle
tribute
to
his
best
qualities
ah
but
you
are
different
she
sighed
you
are
strong
and
resolute
you
would
sway
the
woman
you
loved
and
make
her
what
you
wanted
her
to
be
he
is
clay
for
my
molding
and
i
want
him
to
be
a
splendid
fine
son
like
my
she
looked
at
trent
with
a
tender
proud
smile
if
you
had
ever
met
my
father
you
would
anthony
trent
shifted
uneasily
from
one
foot
to
the
other
he
had
not
dared
for
months
now
to
think
of
that
kindly
country
physician
who
died
from
the
exposure
attendant
on
a
trip
during
a
blizzard
to
aid
a
penniless
patient
i
know
what
you
mean
he
said
at
length
and
i
think
it
is
splendid
of
you
good
god
why
can
people
like
the
guestwicks
object
to
a
girl
like
you
they
ve
never
seen
me
she
explained
and
that
s
the
main
trouble
they
persist
in
thinking
of
me
as
a
adventuress
who
wants
to
blackmail
them
that
money
she
pointed
to
the
safe
i
didn
t
ask
for
it
guestwick
offered
it
to
me
as
a
bribe
to
give
up
my
husband
and
consent
to
a
but
i
still
don
t
see
why
you
are
here
he
said
our
old
servant
arranged
it
she
says
they
always
come
up
here
after
the
opera
all
four
of
them
if
i
confront
them
they
must
see
i
m
not
the
sort
of
girl
they
think
me
i
m
dreading
it
horribly
but
it
s
the
only
anthony
trent
looked
at
her
with
open
admiration
you
ll
win
he
cried
enthusiastically
i
feel
it
in
my
and
when
i
absolutely
refuse
to
take
their
money
they
see
i
m
not
the
adventuress
they
call
anthony
trent
had
by
this
time
forgotten
the
money
the
mention
of
it
reminded
him
of
his
errand
and
the
fleeting
minutes
if
you
don
t
take
it
what
is
going
to
happen
to
it
i
m
going
to
tell
guestwick
that
he
can
t
buy
but
i
m
willing
to
be
bought
he
said
forcing
a
smile
in
fact
that
s
what
i
came
she
shrunk
back
as
though
he
had
struck
her
her
big
eyes
looked
reproach
at
him
tremulous
eager
words
seemed
forced
from
her
by
the
agitation
into
which
his
words
had
thrown
her
you
couldn
t
do
that
now
she
wailed
not
now
you
know
they
ll
be
in
very
soon
now
and
what
could
i
say
if
the
money
was
gone
don
t
you
see
they
would
send
me
away
in
disgrace
and
norton
would
believe
that
i
was
just
as
bad
as
they
said
then
he
d
divorce
me
and
i
think
my
heart
would
damn
muttered
trent
things
were
happening
in
an
unexpected
fashion
he
tried
not
to
look
at
her
piteous
face
please
be
kind
to
me
she
begged
this
is
your
opportunity
to
do
one
great
noble
it
really
means
so
much
to
you
he
asked
it
means
everything
she
said
simply
he
paced
the
room
for
a
minute
or
more
he
was
fighting
a
great
battle
there
remained
in
him
despite
his
mode
of
living
a
certain
generosity
of
character
a
certain
fineness
bequeathed
him
by
generations
of
honorable
folk
he
saw
clearly
what
the
girl
meant
she
was
here
to
fight
for
her
happiness
and
the
redemption
of
the
man
she
loved
how
small
a
thing
it
seemed
to
him
suddenly
was
the
necessity
he
had
felt
for
obtaining
the
miserable
money
what
stinging
mordant
memories
would
always
be
his
if
he
refused
her
there
was
a
tenderness
a
protective
look
in
his
eyes
when
he
glanced
down
at
her
he
was
his
father
s
son
again
it
means
something
to
me
too
he
told
her
to
do
as
you
want
and
i
don
t
believe
there
s
a
person
on
this
green
earth
i
d
do
it
for
but
his
hand
lingered
for
a
moment
on
her
white
shoulder
good
luck
little
the
partly
lighted
hall
full
of
mysterious
shadows
awakened
no
fear
in
him
as
he
quietly
descended
the
stairs
and
when
he
came
to
the
avenue
he
did
not
glance
up
and
down
as
he
usually
did
to
see
whether
or
not
he
was
being
followed
there
was
a
lightness
of
heart
and
an
exaltation
of
spirit
which
he
had
never
experienced
it
was
that
happiness
which
alone
comes
to
the
man
who
has
made
a
sacrifice
there
was
never
a
moment
since
he
had
abandoned
fiction
that
he
was
nearer
to
returning
to
its
uncertain
rewards
pipe
after
pipe
he
smoked
when
he
was
once
more
in
his
quiet
room
and
asked
himself
why
he
had
done
this
thing
there
were
two
reasons
hard
to
dissociate
first
this
wonderful
girl
had
reminded
him
of
the
man
he
had
passionately
admired
his
father
the
father
who
had
taught
him
to
play
fair
and
then
he
was
forced
to
admit
he
had
never
been
more
drawn
to
any
woman
than
to
this
girl
who
must
before
his
last
pipe
was
smoked
have
won
her
victory
or
gone
down
to
defeat
again
and
again
he
told
himself
that
there
was
no
man
he
envied
so
much
as
norton
guestwick
chapter
ix
the
countess
the
next
morning
anthony
trent
observed
that
kinney
was
filled
with
the
excitement
that
attended
the
reading
of
an
unusual
crime
as
set
forth
by
the
morning
papers
it
was
in
those
crimes
committed
in
the
higher
circles
of
society
which
intrigued
her
most
that
society
which
she
had
served
as
a
rule
trent
let
her
wander
on
feeling
that
her
pleasures
were
few
sometimes
he
thought
it
a
little
curious
that
she
should
concern
herself
with
affairs
in
which
he
was
sure
sooner
or
later
to
be
involved
it
was
a
relief
to
know
she
spoke
of
them
to
none
but
him
he
rarely
bothered
to
follow
her
rambling
recitals
contenting
himself
now
and
again
with
exclamations
of
supposed
interest
but
this
morning
he
was
suddenly
roused
from
his
meditations
by
the
mention
of
the
word
guestwick
what
s
that
he
demanded
i
was
telling
you
about
the
guestwick
robbery
sir
she
said
as
she
filled
his
cup
he
did
not
as
a
rule
look
at
the
paper
until
his
breakfast
was
done
to
send
her
for
it
now
might
later
be
used
as
a
chain
in
the
evidence
that
might
even
now
be
forging
for
him
he
affected
a
interest
what
was
it
he
asked
money
mad
returned
kinney
shaking
her
head
all
money
mad
the
root
of
all
a
robbery
was
it
it
was
like
this
kinney
responded
strangely
gratified
that
her
employer
found
her
recital
worth
listening
to
there
was
dollars
in
cash
in
the
safe
in
guestwick
s
library
he
s
a
millionaire
and
lives
on
fifth
avenue
it
s
a
most
mysterious
case
the
butler
swears
his
master
rang
him
up
and
told
him
to
send
all
the
servants
to
at
length
kinney
recited
briggs
s
evidence
before
the
police
captain
who
was
hurriedly
summoned
to
the
mansion
they
arrested
the
butler
said
kinney
mr
guestwick
says
he
came
from
one
of
those
castles
in
england
where
dissolute
noblemen
do
nothing
but
shoot
foxes
all
day
and
play
cards
all
night
the
police
theory
is
that
the
butler
admitted
them
and
then
went
bed
so
as
to
prove
an
mr
guestwick
denies
sending
any
such
message
yes
he
was
at
the
anthony
trent
fought
down
the
desire
to
rush
out
into
the
kitchen
and
take
the
paper
from
before
kinney
s
plate
she
had
said
that
briggs
was
to
have
admitted
more
than
one
person
how
many
did
this
suspected
butler
let
in
only
one
the
man
he
was
in
evening
dress
briggs
suspected
him
from
the
first
but
daren
t
go
against
his
master
s
positive
instructions
briggs
the
butler
says
the
man
must
have
opened
the
door
to
his
accomplice
when
he
d
been
sent
off
to
bed
with
instructions
not
to
answer
any
bell
or
telephone
the
other
was
a
beautiful
young
woman
dressed
just
as
she
d
come
from
the
opera
who
saw
her
if
briggs
did
not
he
demanded
they
caught
her
kinney
returned
triumphantly
and
the
arrest
of
her
accomplice
is
expected
any
minute
they
know
who
he
anthony
trent
put
down
his
untasted
coffee
that
s
interesting
he
commented
do
they
mention
his
name
i
don
t
know
as
they
did
she
replied
i
ll
go
fetch
the
he
read
it
through
with
a
deeper
interest
than
he
had
ever
taken
in
printed
sheet
before
such
was
guestwick
s
importance
that
two
columns
had
been
devoted
to
him
guestwick
on
returning
from
the
opera
was
incensed
to
find
none
to
let
him
in
his
own
house
he
was
compelled
to
use
a
latchkey
the
house
was
silent
and
unlighted
guestwick
although
a
man
of
courage
felt
the
safety
of
his
women
folk
would
be
better
guarded
if
he
called
in
a
passing
policeman
in
the
library
they
came

to
face
with
crime
there
standing
at
the
closed
safe
her
skirt
caught
as
the
heavy
doors
had
swung

a
beautiful
woman
engaged
as
they
came
upon
her
in
trying
to
tear
off
the
imprisoning
garments
five
minutes
later
and
she
would
have
escaped
said
police
sapience
finger
prints
revealed
her
as
a
very
criminal
known
to
the
continental
police
as
the
she
was
one
of
a
gang
which
operated
as
a
rule
on
the
french
and
italian
riviera
and
owed
its
success
to
the
ease
with
which
it
could
assume
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
aristocracy
it
planned
to
steal
from
the
countess
for
example
spoke
english
with
a
perfection
of
idiom
and
inflection
that
was
unequaled
by
a
foreigner
she
was
believed
to
come
from
an
old
family
of
tuscany
despite
a
rigid
examination
by
the
police
she
had
declined
to
make
any
explanation
that
she
told
them
would
be
done
in
court
anthony
trent
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
nine
and
she
would
be
brought
before
a
magistrate
at
ten
so
he
had
been
fooled
all
those
high
resolves
of
his
had
been
brought
into
being
by
a
woman
who
must
have
been
laughing
at
him
all
the
while
who
must
have
congratulated
herself
that
her
lies
had
touched
a
man
s
heart
and
left
fifty
thousand
dollars
for
her
it
was
a
bitter
and
harder
anthony
trent
that
came
to
the
police
court
a
man
who
was
now
almost
as
ashamed
at
his
determination
of
last
night
to
abandon
his
career
as
he
was
now
anxious
to
pursue
it
there
was
possibly
some
danger
in
going
briggs
would
be
there
the
woman
might
point
at
him
in
open
court
there
were
a
hundred
dangers
but
they
had
no
power
to
deter
him
he
swore
to
watch
her
gain
what
particulars
he
might
as
to
her
past
life
and
associates
and
then
take
his
revenge
god
how
she
had
hoodwinked
him
his
face
he
must
of
course
disguise
in
some
simple
manner
it
was
not
difficult
in
court
he
took
a
seat
not
too
far
back
chewing
gum
as
he
had
often
observed
in
the
subway
had
a
marvelous
power
in
altering
an
expression
he
sat
there
his
lower
jaw
thrust
out
and
his
mouth
drawn
down
ceaselessly
chewing
and
one
eye
was
partially
closed
he
had
brought
the
thing
to
perfection
with
shoulders
hunched
he
looked
without
fear
of
detection
into
the
fascinating
green
eyes
of
the
by
this
time
her
defense
was
arranged
last
night
her
lawyer
explained
she
was
so
overcome
with
the
shock
that
she
could
not
make
even
a
simple
statement
to
the
police
miss
violet
benyon
he
declared
of
london
england
and
temporarily
at
the
plaza
had
felt
on
the
previous
evening
need
for
a
walk
knowing
fifth
avenue
to
be
absolutely
safe
she
walked
north
passing
the
guestwick
mansion
she
saw
a
man
in
evening
dress
stealing
down
the
steps
across
the
road
and
into
the
park
fearing
robbery
she
had
rung
the
bell
getting
no
answer
and
finding
the
door
open
she
went
in
the
only
light
was
in
the
library
of
a
fearless
nature
miss
benyon
of
london
went
boldly
in
there
was
an
open
safe
this
she
closed
and
in
the
doing
of
it
was
imprisoned
that
was
all
the
lawyer
swept
the
aside
as
unworthy
evidence
he
was
appearing
before
a
neolithic
magistrate
who
was
prejudiced
against
them
an
imposing
old
lady
who
claimed
to
be
miss
benyon
s
aunt
went
bail
for
her
niece
s
appearance
to
the
amount
of
ten
thousand
dollars
she
mentioned
as
close
friends
names
of
well
known
americans
socially
elect
who
would
rush
to
her
rescue
ere
the
day
was
out
so
impressive
was
she
and
so
splendid
a
witness
did
miss
benyon
make
that
the
magistrate
disregarded
guestwick
s
plea
and
admitted
her
to
bail
trent
knew
very
well
that
central
office
men
would
dog
the
steps
of
aunt
and
niece
making
escape
almost
impossible
but
he
was
nevertheless
convinced
that
miss
violet
benyon
of
london
or
the
countess
from
the
riviera
would
never
return
to
the
magistrate
s
court
as
that
trusting
jurist
anticipated
and
anthony
trent
was
right
the
two
women
despite
police
surveillance
left
the
hotel
and
merged
themselves
among
the
millions
the
younger
woman
taking
advantage
of
a
new
maid
s
inexperience
offered
her
a
reward
for
permitting
her
to
escape
by
back
ways
in
order
to
win
as
she
averred
a
bet
the
aunt
s
escape
was
unexplained
by
the
police
they
found
awaiting
the
elder
woman
s
coming
a
girl
from
a
milliner
s
shop
she
was
allowed
to
go
without
examination
trent
read
the
account
very
carefully
and
stored
every
published
particular
in
his
trained
memory
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
that
the
milliner
s
assistant
was
the
aunt
he
remembered
her
as
a
slim
elderly
woman
very
much
on
his
own
account
he
called
at
the
milliner
s
and
made
some
inquiries
he
found
that
there
was
no
account
with
the
benyons
and
no
assistant
had
been
sent
to
the
hotel
it
was
none
of
his
business
to
aid
police
authorities
and
he
was
not
anxious
that
the
two
should
be
caught
in
that
way
there
would
come
a
time
when
he
was
retired
from
his
present
occupation
when
he
would
feel
the
need
of
excitement
getting
even
with
the
clever
actress
who
prevented
him
from
taking
the
guestwick
money
would
call
for
his
astutest
planning
chapter
x
anthony
trent
saves
a
piano
for
some
months
now
trent
had
been
preparing
a
campaign
against
the
collection
of
precious
stones
belonging
to
carr
faulkner
whose
white
stone
mansion
looked
across
the
park
from
his
home
but
whereas
trent
s
house
faced
east
the
faulkner
abode
looked
west
and
in
matter
of
residence
locality
there
is
an
appreciable
difference
in
this
outlook
the
faulkner
millions
were
in
the
main
inherited
there
was
a
conservative
banking
house
on
broad
street
bearing
the
faulkner
name
but
it
did
not
look
for
new
business
and
found
its
principal
work
in
guarding
the
vast
faulkner
fortune
faulkner
s
first
wife
had
been
a
collector
of
pearls
those
modest
stones
whose
assembled
value
is
always
worth
the
criminal
s
attention
the
second
wife
a
young
woman
of
less
aristocratic
stock
eschewed
pearls
holding
the
theory
that
each
one
was
a
tear
she
wanted
flashing
stones
which
advertised
their
value
more
ostentatiously
trent
had
seen
her
at
the
opera
and
marked
her
down
as
a
profitable
client
it
was
because
trent
worked
so
carefully
that
he
made
so
few
mistakes
he
had
no
friends
to
ask
him
leading
questions
and
gossip
about
his
mode
of
life
he
had
been
half
a
year
collecting
information
about
the
carr
faulkners
the
style
in
which
they
lived
the
intimate
friends
they
had
and
a
hundred
little
details
which
a
careful
professional
must
know
before
he
can
hope
to
make
a
success
the
system
of
burglar
alarm
installed
in
the
mansion
was
an
elaborate
one
but
he
was
not
unskilled
in
matters
of
this
sort
for
three
months
he
had
worked
in
the
shop
where
they
were
made
and
his
general
inborn
mechanical
skill
had
been
aided
by
conscientious
study
attention
to
detail
had
saved
him
more
than
once
and
is
an
aid
to
be
counted
on
more
than
luck
yet
it
was
sheer
blind
kindly
garrulous
luck
that
finally
took
trent
unsuspected
into
the
carr
faulkner
mansion
riding
up
madison
avenue
in
a
trolley
car
late
one
afternoon
he
overheard
one
of
the
faulkner
s
maids
discussing
the
family
one
of
the
girls
had
knocked
over
a
vase
of
cut
flowers
which
stood
on
a
grand
piano
in
carr
faulkner
s
boudoir
and
the
water
had
leaked
through
onto
the
wire
and
wood
doing
some
little
damage
she
was
madder
n
a
wet
hen
said
the
girl
them
things
cost
a
lot
of
money
her
companion
commented
and
that
was
inlaid
like
all
the
other
things
in
her
room
gee
the
way
faulkner
spends
the
money
on
her
is
a
second
wives
have
a
cinch
said
the
first
girl
sneering
from
all
i
hear
the
first
was
a
perfect
lady
and
kind
to
the
maids
but
this
one
is
ordinary
you
should
have
heard
what
she
said
about
me
over
the
phone
when
she
told
the
piano
people
to
send
a
tuner
up
and
me
standing
there
said
i
was
clumsy
and
stupid
and
a
i
could
tell
something
about
fools
if
i
wanted
to
and
she
knows
her
friend
cautioned
her
be
careful
she
whispered
you
may
want
to
lose
your
job
but
i
don
t
don
t
talk
so
it
was
hardly
five
o
clock
anthony
trent
left
the
car
and
started
for
a
telephone
booth
he
went
methodically
through
the
lists
of
the
better
known
piano
makers
there
was
one
firm
whose
instrument
was
frequently
encased
in
rare
woods
for
specially
furnished
rooms
this
is
carr
faulkner
s
secretary
speaking
he
began
when
the
number
was
given
to
him
have
you
been
instructed
to
see
about
a
piano
here
we
are
sending
a
man
right
away
he
was
told
morning
will
do
said
the
supposed
secretary
we
are
giving
a
small
dance
and
it
will
not
be
we
should
prefer
to
send
now
came
the
answer
a
valuable
instrument
might
be
extensively
damaged
if
not
attended
to
right
trent
became
confidential
he
dropped
his
voice
it
s
nothing
for
faulkner
to
buy
a
new
instrument
if
it
s
needed
but
it
s
a
serious
thing
if
a
dance
that
faulkner
gives
is
interrupted
money
is
no
consideration
here
as
you
ought
to
the
piano
man
remembering
the
price
that
was
exacted
for
the
special
case
smiled
to
himself
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
sell
a
new
instrument
it
would
not
surprise
him
if
this
affable
secretary
called
in
some
fine
morning
and
hinted
at
commission
such
things
had
been
done
before
in
the
trade
it
s
just
as
you
say
he
returned
at
what
hour
shall
our
jackson
call
as
soon
as
he
likes
after
ten
said
the
obliging
trent
and
rang
off
then
he
called
up
the
carr
faulkner
house
and
told
the
answering
man
servant
that
jackson
of
stoneham
s
would
call
at
half
past
six
he
was
switched
on
to
the
private
wire
of
carr
faulkner
it
s
disgraceful
that
you
can
t
come
before
she
stormed
yours
is
specially
made
instrument
he
reminded
her
and
i
need
special
then
he
took
the
crosstown
car
to
his
home
and
changed
into
a
neat
dark
business
suit
he
also
arrayed
himself
in
a
brand
new
shirt
and
collar
kinney
always
washed
these
and
many
a
criminal
has
had
his
identity
proved
by
his
laundry
mark
trent
like
a
wise
man
admitted
the
possibility
that
some
day
he
might
be
caught
but
was
determined
never
to
take
the
risks
that
lesser
craftsmen
hardly
thought
of
anthony
trent
thought
it
most
probable
that
the
faulkner
s
butler
would
be
of
the
imported
species
he
hoped
so
he
found
that
they
were
more
easily
impressed
by
good
manners
and
dress
than
the
domestic
breed
some
day
he
determined
to
write
an
essay
on
butlers
there
was
conington
warren
s
austin
cold
severe
aloof
there
was
guestwick
s
man
the
jovial
sportsman
type
molding
himself
no
doubt
on
some
admired
employer
of
earlier
days
faulkner
s
butler
was
an
amiable
creature
and
inclined
to
associate
with
a
piano
tuner
on
equal
terms
he
had
rather
fine
features
and
was
admired
of
the
female
domestics
his
dignity
forbade
him
to
indulge
in
much
familiarity
with
the
men
beneath
him
and
he
welcomed
the
as
an
opportunity
to
converse
i
knew
you
by
your
voice
said
the
butler
cordially
come
there
was
little
chance
that
the
maid
servants
behind
whom
he
had
sat
on
the
car
would
recognize
him
or
if
they
did
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
be
suspicious
carr
faulkner
s
boudoir
was
a
delightful
room
on
the
third
floor
a
little
electric
elevator
leading
to
it
was
pointed
out
by
the
butler
not
for
the
likes
of
you
or
me
said
the
man
we
can
carr
faulkner
was
a
dissatisfied
looking
blonde
woman
in
her
opera
box
surrounded
by
friends
and
displaying
her
famous
jewels
she
had
seemed
a
vision
of
loveliness
to
the
gazing
trent
here
in
her
own
home
and
dealing
with
those
whom
she
considered
her
inferiors
she
made
no
effort
to
be
even
civil
who
is
this
person
she
demanded
of
the
butler
the
man
come
to
look
at
the
piano
ma
am
he
returned
you
re
not
jackson
she
said
with
abruptness
it
was
plain
jackson
was
known
trent
blamed
himself
for
not
thinking
of
this
possibility
i
am
the
head
tuner
he
said
with
dignity
we
understood
it
was
a
case
where
the
highest
skill
was
she
looked
at
him
coldly
i
don
t
know
that
it
demands
much
of
what
you
call
skill
she
retorted
acidly
you
have
come
at
a
singularly
inconvenient
hour
please
get
to
work
at
with
this
she
left
the
room
the
butler
gazed
after
her
scowling
do
you
have
to
put
up
with
that
all
day
trent
asked
him
how
the
boss
stands
it
i
don
t
know
said
the
butler
why
take
it
out
on
a
mere
piano
tuner
trent
asked
the
butler
winked
knowingly
he
dug
trent
in
the
ribs
with
a
fine
free
and
friendly
gesture
speaking
as
one
man
of
the
world
to
another
he
observed
i
guess
you
spoiled
a
little
as
we
say
in
gay
paree
carr
faulkner
leaves
the
union
club
at
seven
and
walks
up
the
avenue
in
time
to
dress
for
his
dinner
at
eight
there
s
another
gentleman
leaves
another
club
on
the
same
avenue
and
gets
here
as
a
rule
at
six
and
leaves
in
time
to
avoid
the
the
butler
leaned
forward
and
whispered
in
the
tuner
s
ear
she
s
crazy
about
him
the
only
man
who
doesn
t
know
is
the
boss
it
s
always
the
way
added
the
man
of
the
world
i
wouldn
t
trust
any
woman
living
the
more
they
have
the
worse
they
are
if
ever
i
marry
i
ll
take
a
job
as
lighthouse
keeper
and
take
my
wife
will
they
come
in
here
trent
asked
anxiously
he
wanted
the
opportunity
to
do
his
own
work
while
the
family
dined
and
he
did
not
want
to
be
seen
by
an
unnecessary
person
he
disliked
taking
even
a
million
to
one
shot
the
cynical
butler
interpreted
his
interest
differently
you
won
t
understand
a
word
of
what
they
re
saying
they
talk
in
french
she
was
at
school
in
lausanne
and
he
s
a
french
count
or
says
he
is
i
ve
made
a
mistake
in
scorning
foreign
languages
the
butler
admitted
i
d
give
a
lot
to
know
what
they
talk
he
was
not
to
know
that
trent
knew
french
moderately
well
left
to
himself
trent
called
to
mind
the
actions
of
a
piano
tuner
he
had
often
watched
his
own
grand
being
tuned
when
carr
faulkner
came
into
the
room
she
beheld
an
earnest
young
man
delving
among
the
piano
s
depths
she
was
interested
in
no
man
but
jules
d
aucquier
who
filled
her
heart
and
emptied
her
purse
is
the
thing
much
damaged
she
asked
presently
i
think
not
he
replied
then
you
need
not
stay
long
i
shall
go
as
soon
as
possible
he
said
she
sank
into
a
deep
chair
and
thought
of
jules
and
there
came
to
her
face
a
softer
happier
look
the
butler
s
talk
trent
dismissed
as
mere
servants
gossip
of
carr
faulkner
he
knew
nothing
except
that
he
was
years
older
than
his
wife
he
was
probably
a
wealthy
roué
who
had
coveted
this
beautiful
woman
and
bought
her
in
marriage
in
high
society
it
was
often
that
way
he
mused
family
coercion
perhaps
or
the
need
to
aid
impoverished
parents
it
was
being
done
every
day
this
man
of
whom
the
butler
spoke
was
probably
her
own
age
since
the
stone
age
this
domestic
intrigue
must
have
been
going
on
he
touched
the
keyboard
pianissimo
at
first
and
then
growing
bolder
plunged
into
the
glorious
it
was
not
the
sort
of
thing
jackson
would
have
done
but
then
anthony
trent
was
a
head
tuner
as
he
had
explained
he
watched
the
woman
s
face
to
see
into
what
mood
the
music
would
lead
her
he
was
speedily
to
find
out
stop
she
commanded
and
rising
to
her
feet
came
to
his
side
why
do
you
do
that
i
must
try
it
he
answered
a
little
sheepishly
we
always
have
to
test
an
but
to
play
the
she
said
severely
i
have
heard
them
all
play
it
bauer
borwick
grainger
d
albert
and
hoffman
and
you
dare
to
try
it
was
impertinent
of
you
of
course
if
you
must
play
just
play
those
chords
tuners
always
trent
admitted
afterwards
he
had
never
been
more
angry
or
felt
more
insulted
in
his
life
he
had
not
for
a
moment
supposed
this
butterfly
woman
even
knew
the
name
of
what
he
played
i
won
t
offend
again
he
said
with
what
he
hoped
was
a
sarcastic
inflection
she
answered
never
a
word
she
seemed
to
be
listening
trent
heard
a
sound
that
might
have
been
the
opening
of
the
elevator
door
then
came
hurried
steps
along
the
hall
and
jules
d
aucquier
entered
he
was
dark
to
the
point
of
swarthiness
tall
and
graceful
his
rather
small
head
reminded
trent
of
a
snake
s
as
a
man
who
knew
men
trent
determined
that
the
newcomer
was
dangerous
the
look
that
he
threw
across
the
room
to
the
intruder
was
not
pleasant
he
spoke
very
quickly
in
french
who
is
this
he
demanded
no
one
who
matters
she
answered
in
the
same
tongue
but
what
is
the
pig
doing
here
at
this
hour
he
asked
repairing
the
piano
she
told
him
a
poor
tuner
i
imagine
for
the
reason
that
he
plays
so
well
i
had
to
stop
him
when
he
began
the
it
affects
me
too
much
that
was
being
played
when
you
first
looked
into
my
eyes
dear
send
him
away
the
man
commanded
but
that
would
look
suspicious
she
declared
trent
noticed
that
jules
did
not
respond
to
the
affection
which
was
in
the
woman
s
tone
you
should
not
telephone
to
me
at
the
club
he
said
as
he
took
a
seat
at
her
side
i
am
only
a
temporary
member
and
do
not
want
to
embarrass
my
but
you
were
so
cruel
to
me
yesterday
she
murmured
cruel
he
repeated
and
turned
his
cold
snake
eyes
on
her
eyes
that
could
when
he
willed
it
glow
with
fire
and
passion
who
is
the
crueler
you
or
i
what
do
you
mean
she
cried
almost
tearfully
you
know
i
love
and
yet
when
i
ask
you
to
do
a
favor
which
is
easily
within
your
power
to
perform
you
refuse
i
must
have
money
that
you
it
is
always
money
now
she
complained
you
no
longer
say
that
you
love
how
can
i
when
my
creditors
bark
at
my
heels
like
hungry
dogs
unless
i
pay
by
it
is
finished
you
and
i
see
one
another
no
more
that
is
he
looked
at
her
in
annoyed
surprise
when
she
suddenly
smiled
he
watched
her
with
an
even
greater
interest
than
the
man
gazing
from
behind
the
piano
from
an
escritoire
she
took
a
package
wrapped
in
lavender
paper
this
she
placed
in
the
pocket
of
the
coat
that
he
had
thrown
across
a
chair
what
good
are
cigarettes
to
me
now
he
demanded
i
have
told
you
that
unless
i
have
fifteen
thousand
dollars
by
noon
i
am
when
you
get
to
your
rooms
she
said
smiling
open
your
cigarettes
and
see
if
i
do
not
love
trent
admitted
this
jules
was
undeniably
handsome
now
that
the
dark
face
was
wreathed
in
smiles
jules
gathered
her
in
his
arms
my
soul
he
whispered
and
covered
her
face
with
kisses
when
he
attempted
to
rise
and
go
to
the
coat
his
eyes
were
staring
at
she
held
him
tight
i
got
twenty
thousand
from
him
she
said
you
will
find
the
twenty
bills
each
wrapped
in
the
cigarette
papers
i
pushed
the
tobacco
out
and
they
fitted
wasteful
one
he
said
in
tender
reproach
and
sought
again
to
retrieve
his
coat
unfortunately
for
the
debonair
jules
d
aucquier
this
was
not
immediately
possible
the
click
of
the
little
elevator
was
heard
the
two
looked
at
one
another
in
alarm
it
must
be
carr
she
whispered
nobody
else
could
possibly
use
that
elevator
now
somebody
has
told
she
looked
about
her
in
despair
you
must
hide
quick
behind
the
piano
there
until
i
get
him
trent
working
industriously
amid
the
wreckage
of
what
had
been
a
grand
piano
looked
up
with
polite
surprise
at
the
tall
man
who
flung
himself
almost
at
his
feet
and
tried
to
conceal
himself
behind
part
of
the
instrument
hide
me
quickly
jules
whispered
do
you
hear
i
will
give
you
money
quick
fool
don
t
gape
at
for
the
second
time
that
evening
anthony
trent
smothered
his
anger
and
smiled
when
rage
was
in
his
heart
and
he
did
so
for
the
second
time
not
because
he
was
conscious
of
fear
but
because
he
saw
himself
suitably
rewarded
for
his
efforts
he
felt
a
note
thrust
into
his
hand
but
this
was
not
the
reward
he
looked
for
he
was
arranging
the
piano
débris
around
the
prostrate
jules
when
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
and
carr
faulkner
entered
the
millionaire
s
eye
fell
first
of
all
upon
the
coat
over
the
chair
who
s
is
this
he
demanded
the
pause
was
hardly
perceptible
before
she
answered
i
suppose
it
belongs
to
the
piano
faulkner
looked
across
at
the
instrument
and
beheld
the
busy
trent
taking
what
else
was
possible
from
the
stoneman
all
the
king
s
horses
and
all
the
king
s
men
could
not
put
that
instrument
together
again
easily
trent
went
about
his
business
with
quiet
persistence
carr
faulkner
s
voice
was
very
courteous
and
kind
as
he
addressed
the
tuner
i
m
afraid
i
must
ask
you
to
wait
outside
in
the
hall
for
a
few
minutes
until
i
have
had
a
little
private
talk
with
my
is
that
necessary
she
said
quickly
i
m
just
going
to
dress
for
dinner
we
have
people
coming
there
is
time
he
said
meaningly
i
left
my
club
half
an
hour
earlier
did
the
change
incommode
you
why
should
it
she
said
lightly
faulkner
was
a
man
of
middle
age
with
a
fine
thoughtful
face
it
was
a
face
that
made
an
instant
appeal
to
trent
it
mirrored
kindliness
and
good
breeding
and
reminded
him
in
a
subtle
way
of
his
own
father
a
country
physician
who
had
died
a
dozen
years
before
his
only
son
left
the
way
of
honest
men
a
few
minutes
only
he
said
and
trent
passed
out
into
the
hall
taking
care
to
leave
the
door
opened
an
inch
or
so
it
was
necessary
for
his
peace
of
mind
that
he
should
know
what
it
was
faulkner
had
to
say
to
his
wife
it
might
concern
him
vitally
it
was
possible
that
inquiry
at
stoneman
s
might
have
informed
faulkner
of
his
trickery
while
this
was
improbable
trent
was
not
minded
to
be
careless
this
kindly
aspect
of
the
millionaire
might
be
assumed
to
put
him
off
his
guard
even
now
men
might
be
stationed
at
the
exits
to
arrest
him
very
quietly
he
stole
back
to
the
door
and
listened
i
have
found
out
for
certain
what
i
have
long
suspected
faulkner
was
saying
to
his
wife
it
is
always
the
husband
who
learns
last
don
t
protest
he
added
i
know
too
much
i
know
for
example
that
you
have
sold
many
of
your
jewels
to
provide
funds
for
a
gambler
and
a
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
she
cried
you
do
he
said
and
there
was
a
trace
of
deep
sadness
in
his
voice
you
know
too
well
this
man
jules
d
aucquier
is
not
of
a
noble
french
family
at
all
he
is
a
and
was
formerly
a
valet
to
an
english
officer
of
title
at
ottawa
it
was
there
he
picked
up
this
smattering
of
knowledge
which
has
made
it
easy
to
fool
the
i
don
t
believe
it
she
cried
vehemently
he
looked
at
her
sadly
the
whole
scene
was
crucifixion
for
him
i
shall
prove
it
he
said
quietly
i
don
t
care
if
you
do
she
flung
back
at
him
you
would
care
for
him
just
the
same
he
asked
i
have
not
said
that
i
care
for
him
at
all
she
said
a
trace
of
caution
creeping
into
her
manner
i
shall
give
you
the
opportunity
to
prove
it
one
way
or
another
within
a
few
minutes
we
have
come
to
the
parting
of
the
it
was
at
this
moment
anthony
trent
knocked
timidly
upon
the
door
the
stage
was
set
to
his
liking
when
he
was
bidden
to
enter
his
quick
eye
took
in
everything
there
out
of
sight
d
aucquier
skulked
while
he
prepared
to
hear
his
despicable
history
told
to
the
woman
who
was
his
victim
as
for
the
woman
she
was
defiant
she
would
probably
elect
to
follow
a
scoundrel
who
had
fascinated
her
and
leave
a
man
behind
whose
good
name
she
had
trailed
in
the
dust
the
situation
was
not
a
new
one
but
trent
was
moved
by
it
carr
faulkner
had
all
his
sympathy
he
registered
a
vow
if
ever
he
met
d
aucquier
or
whatever
his
name
might
be
to
exact
a
punishment
excuse
me
said
anthony
trent
stepping
into
the
room
but
my
train
leaves
in
twenty
minutes
i
live
out
in
long
island
and
i
ve
got
to
catch
it
or
else
the
missus
will
be
faulkner
looked
at
him
frowning
she
wanted
to
get
this
scene
over
he
was
a
good
looking
piano
tuner
she
decided
and
now
his
tragedy
was
plain
he
who
had
no
doubt
once
aimed
at
the
concert
stage
tuned
pianos
to
support
a
wife
and
home
in
long
island
i
ll
finish
the
job
she
waved
him
toward
the
door
imperiously
every
moment
she
and
her
husband
spent
in
this
room
added
to
the
chance
of
the
hiding
man
s
discovery
why
don
t
you
go
she
cried
anthony
trent
permitted
himself
to
smile
faintly
i
ve
come
for
my
coat
ma
am
he
said
and
glanced
at
the
raiment
d
aucquier
had
thrown
carelessly
over
a
chair
the
coat
now
laden
with
such
precious
cigarettes
carr
faulkner
was
growing
impatient
at
this
interruption
he
could
not
understand
the
look
of
anger
on
his
wife
s
face
don
t
you
understand
he
exclaimed
that
the
man
merely
wants
to
go
home
and
take
his
coat
with
him
he
turned
to
the
deferential
trent
all
right
all
right
trent
moved
to
the
chair
and
took
the
garment
at
the
door
he
turned
about
and
bowed
profoundly
in
the
lower
hall
he
found
the
cynical
butler
whose
ideas
on
matrimony
were
so
decided
he
startled
that
functionary
by
thrusting
into
his
hand
the
ten
dollars
d
aucquier
had
forced
upon
him
what
s
this
for
demanded
the
butler
when
piano
tuners
came
with
gifts
in
their
hands
he
was
suspicious
i
don
t
understand
he
observed
that
the
affability
which
had
made
the
tuner
seem
kin
to
himself
was
vanished
a
different
man
now
looked
at
him
it
s
for
you
said
trent
i
m
not
a
piano
tuner
i
m
a
detective
and
i
came
here
after
that
who
pretends
to
be
a
french
the
butler
breathed
hard
i
ate
that
man
sir
he
said
simply
i
d
like
to
dot
him
you
ll
be
able
to
and
that
within
five
minutes
trent
assured
him
he
is
concealed
behind
the
lid
of
the
grand
piano
i
was
supposed
to
repair
and
faulkner
are
both
in
the
room
but
doesn
t
know
jules
is
there
you
take
two
footmen
and
yank
him
out
and
then
if
you
want
to
dot
him
one
or
two
there
s
your
the
muscles
of
the
butler
s
big
shoulders
swelled
with
anticipation
where
are
you
going
he
asked
of
trent
now
making
for
the
front
door
to
get
the
patrol
wagon
said
anthony
trent
how
long
will
you
be
asked
the
man
i
shall
be
back
in
no
time
trent
answered
cryptically
arrived
in
his
quiet
rooms
he
undid
the
box
of
cigarettes
at
first
he
thought
he
had
been
fooled
for
the
top
layer
of
cigarettes
were
and
normal
but
it
was
on
the
next
row
that
carr
faulkner
had
expended
her
trouble
each
one
contained
a
new
thousand
dollar
bill
and
their
tint
enthralled

cashing
a
modest
check
at
the
colonial
bank
one
morning
trent
had
fallen
in
line
with
a
queue
at
the
paying
teller
s
window
he
made
it
a
point
to
observe
what
went
on
while
he
waited
he
was
not
much
interested
in
bank
robberies
to
begin
with
the

bankers
association

as

furthermore
a
successful
bank
robbery
unless
the
work
of
an
inside
man
needs
careful
planning
and
collaboration
on
this
particular
morning
trent
saw
a
stout
and
jocund
gentleman
push
his
check
across
the
glass
entrance
to
the
cashier
s
cave
and
received
without
hesitation
a
large
sum
of
money
he
passed
the
time
of
day
with
the
official
climbed
into
a
limousine
and
was
whirled
up
broadway
did
yer
see
that
a
youth
demanded
who
stood
before
trent
what
he
asked
quietly
it
was
not
his
pose
to
be
interested
in
other
of
the
bank
s
customers
that
guy
took
out
twenty
thousand
dollars
the
boy
said
reverence
in
his
tone
that
s
a
lot
of
money
said
trent
he
lives
well
said
the
lad
i
ought
to
know
he
gets
his
groceries
from
us
and
he
only
eats

drinks
the
he
looks
like

if
the
stout
and
jocund
gourmet
had
known
what
was
in
trent
s
mind
he
would
have
hied
him
back
to
the
bank
and
redeposited
his
cash
it
s
rudolf
liebermann
isn
t
it
that
s
frederick
williams
and
he
lives
on
near
the
what
additional
information
trent
wanted
to
know
might
be
obtained
from
other
than
this
boy
to
make
many
inquiries
might
if
frederick
williams
were
relieved
of
his
roll
bring
back
the
incident
to
the
grocer
s
boy
directly
dusk
fell
anthony
trent
in
the
evening
garb
of
fashion
crossed
over
to
riverside
drive
and
presently
came
to
the
heroic
statue
of
jeanne
d
arc
which
stands
at
the
foot
of
street
by
this
time
he
knew
the
license
number
of
the
williams
limousine
and
the
address
it
was
one
of
those
small
residences
of
gray
stone
containing
a
dozen
rooms
or
so
such
houses
as
he
knew
were
usually
laid
out
on
a
similar
plan
and
he
was
familiar
with
it
it
was
very
rarely
that
he
made
a
professional
visit
to
a
house
without
having
a
definite
plan
of
attack
carefully
worked
out
this
was
the
first
time
he
sought
to
gain
entrance
to
a
strange
house
on
the
mere
chance
of
success
but
the
twenty
thousand
dollars
in
crisp
notes
tempted
him
in
his
last
affair
he
had
netted
this
sum
in
notes
of
a
similar
denomination
and
he
was
superstitious
enough
to
feel
that
this
augured
well
for
s
success
careful
as
ever
trent
had
made
his
alibis
in
case
of
failure
in
one
of
his
pockets
was
a
pint
flask
of
bourbon
empty
save
for
a
dram
of
spirit
in
another
was
a
slip
of
paper
containing
the
name
of
the
who
occupied
a
house
with
the
same
number
as
that
of
williams
but
on
street
once
before
he
had
saved
himself
by
this
ruse
he
had
protested
vigorously
when
detected
by
a
footman
that
he
was
merely
playing
a
practical
joke
on
his
old
college
chum
who
lived
as
he
thought
in
this
particular
house
but
was
found
to
be
on
the
next
block
and
in
this
case
the
emptied
whiskey
flask
and
the
cheerful
tipsiness
of
the
amiable
young
man
of
fashion
trent
s
most
successful
pose
saved
him
in
his
pockets
nothing
would
be
found
to
incriminate
him
he
knew
well
the
folly
of
carrying
the
automatic
so
beloved
of
screen
or
stage
raffles
in
the
first
place
the
sudden
temptation
to
murder
in
a
tight
pinch
and
in
the
second
the
sullivan
law
in
the
bamboo
cane
carefully
concealed
were
slender
rods
of
steel
whose
presence
few
would
suspect
he
had
left
such
a
cane
in
senator
scrivener
s
fifth
avenue
mansion
when
he
was
compelled
to
make
an
unrehearsed
exit
once
he
met
the
senator
coming
down
the
steps
of
the
union
club
with
this
cane
in
his
hand
he
chuckled
to
think
what
might
be
that
worthy
s
chagrin
to
know
he
had
been
carrying
burglar
s
tools
with
him
as
there
was
little
light
on
the
lower
floor
of
frederick
williams
house
trent
let
himself
in
cautiously
there
was
a
dim
hanging
light
which
showed
that
the
williams
idea
of
furnishing
was
in
massive
bad
taste
at
the
rear
of
the
hall
were
the
kitchens
under
the
swinging
door
he
could
see
a
bright
light
the
stairs
were
wide
and
did
not
creak
carefully
he
ascended
them
and
stood
breathless
in
a
foyer
between
the
two
main
there
were
voices
in
the
rear
room
which
should
if
williams
conformed
to
the
majority
of
dwellers
in
such
houses
be
the
big
doors
shut
out
view
and
sound
until
he
crept
nearer
and
peeped
through
a
keyhole
he
could
see
williams
sitting
in
a
turkish
rocker
smoking
a
cigar
there
were
two
other
men
and
all
three
chattered
volubly
in
german
unfortunately
it
was
a
tongue
of
which
the
listener
knew
almost
nothing
reasonably
fluent
in
french
the
comprehension
of
german
was
beyond
him
there
was
a
small
safe
in
the
corner
and
it
was
not
closed
trent
felt
certain
that
in
it
reposed
those
notes
he
had
come
for
in
the
corner
of
the
foyer
was
a
carven
teakwood
table
with
a
glass
top
and
on
it
was
a
large
boston
fern
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
crouch
there
unobserved
the
only
possibility
of
discovery
was
the
remote
contingency
that
williams
and
his
friends
might
choose
to
use
this
foyer
but
trent
had
seen
that
it
was
not
furnished
as
a
he
had
barely
determined
on
his
hiding
place
when
he
found
the
sudden
necessity
to
use
it
williams
arose
quickly
and
advanced
to
the
door
when
he
threw
it
open
the
path
of
light
left
the
unbidden
one
completely
obscured
the
three
men
passed
by
him
and
entered
the
in
front
trent
caught
a
view
of
a
luxuriously
overfurnished
room
and
a
grand
piano
then
williams
began
to
play
a
part
of
a
brahms
sonata
so
well
that
trent
s
heart
warmed
toward
him
but
his
appreciation
of
the
master
did
not
permit
him
to
listen
to
the
whole
movement
he
crept
cautiously
from
his
cover
and
into
the
room
the
three
had
just
vacated
if
there
were
other
of
williams
friends
or
family
here
trent
might
be
called
upon
to
exercise
his
undoubted
talents
one
man
he
would
not
hesitate
to
attack
since
his
working
knowledge
of
was
beyond
the
average
if
there
were
two
attack
would
be
useless
in
the
absence
of
a
revolver
but
if
the
coast
were
clear
ah
then
a
competence
all
the
golf
and
fishing
he
desired
there
would
be
only
the
countess
to
deal
with
at
his
leisure
the
room
was
empty
but
safe
was
williams
was
not
devoid
of
caution
a
glance
at
the
thing
showed
trent
that
in
an
uninterrupted
half
hour
he
could
learn
its
secrets
but
he
could
hardly
be
assured
of
that
at
nine
o
clock
at
night
his
very
presence
in
the
room
was
fraught
with
danger
the
one
door
leading
from
it
opened
into
a
butler
s
pantry
from
which
a
flight
of
stairs
led
into
the
kitchen
part
of
the
house
downstairs
he
could
hear
faucets
running
a
dumbwaiter
offered
a
way
of
escape
if
he
were
put
to
it
to
the
side
of
the
dumbwaiter
was
a
compartment
used
for
drying
dishes
it
was
four
feet
long
and
three
in
height
and
a
shelf
bisected
it
this
he
took
out
carefully
and
placed
upon
the
floor
of
the
compartment
making
an
ample
space
for
concealment
a
radiator
opened
into
it
giving
the
heat
desired
and
two
iron
gratings
in
the
doors
afforded
trent
the
opportunity
to
overhear
what
might
be
said
he
satisfied
himself
that
the
doors
opened
noiselessly
the
burglar
s
rôle
was
not
always
an
heroic
one
he
told
himself
and
thought
of
the
popular
misconception
of
such
activities
it
must
have
been
an
hour
later
when
he
heard
sounds
in
the
adjoining
room
by
this
time
he
was
fighting
against
the
drowsiness
induced
by
the
heat
of
his
prison
the
swinging
door
between
the
butler
s
pantry
and
the
was
thrown
open
and
williams
came
in
he
leaned
over
the
staircase
and
shouted
something
in
german
to
some
one
in
the
kitchen
who
answered
him
in
the
same
tongue
there
was
the
sound
below
of
locking
and
bolting
the
doors
the
servants
had
evidently
been
sent
to
bed
when
williams
went
back
to
the
other
room
the
door
between
did
not
swing
to
by
four
or
five
inches
so
far
as
williams
was
concerned
this
carelessness
was
to
cost
him
more
than
he
guessed
even
in
his
hiding
place
the
conversation
was
audible
to
trent
although
its
meaning
was
incomprehensible
he
was
suddenly
awakened
to
a
more
vivid
interest
when
he
became
aware
that
it
was
now
english
that
they
were
talking
there
was
a
newcomer
in
the
room
a
man
with
a
nasal
carrying
voice
and
a
prodigious
brogue
this
gentlemen
he
heard
williams
say
is
o
sheill
who
has
done
so
much
good
work
for
us
and
for
the
freedom
of
oppressed
starving
shackled
ireland
which
we
shall
free
i
may
tell
o
sheill
that
the
highest
personages
in
the
fatherland
weep
bitter
tears
for
ireland
s
that
s
all
right
said
the
sinn
feiner
a
trifle
ungraciously
but
what
s
behind
yonder
door
for
answer
one
of
the
other
men
flung
it
open
turned
up
the
lights
and
permitted
o
sheill
to
make
his
examination
trent
heard
the
man
s
heavy
tread
as
he
descended
the
stairway
and
found
at
the
bottom
a
locked
door
you
ve
got
to
be
careful
o
sheill
said
when
he
rejoined
williams
and
the
rest
these
damned
secret
service
men
are
everywhere
they
tell
that
is
why
we
have
rented
a
private
house
one
of
the
germans
declared
at
an
hotel
privacy
is
impossible
we
have
had
our
these
scraps
of
conversation
aroused
anthony
trent
immediately
it
required
only
a
cursory
knowledge
of
the
affairs
of
the
moment
for
a
duller
man
than
he
to
realize
that
he
had
come
across
the
scent
of
one
of
those
plots
which
were
so
hampering
his
government
in
their
prosecution
of
the
war
very
cautiously
he
crawled
from
his
hiding
place
and
made
his
silent
way
to
the
barely
opened
door
o
sheill
was
lighting
a
large
cigar
his
was
a
suspicious
dour
face
williams
urbane
and
florid
was
very
patient
that
i
do
not
tell
you
the
names
of
my
colleagues
he
said
is
of
no
moment
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
you
have
the
honor
to
be
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
most
illustrious
personages
in
my
here
he
bowed
in
the
direction
of
a
small
thin
dapper
man
who
did
not
return
the
salutation
i
came
for
the
money
said
o
sheill
you
came
first
for
your
instructions
snapped
the
illustrious
personage
coldly
that
s
so
yer
honor
o
sheill
answered
there
was
something
menacing
in
the
tone
of
the
other
man
and
he
recognized
it
this
money
said
williams
is
given
for
very
definite
purposes
and
an
accounting
will
be
ain
t
you
satisfied
with
the
way
i
managed
it
at
cork
o
sheill
demanded
it
was
a
beginning
williams
conceded
here
is
what
you
must
do
wherever
along
the
irish
coast
the
english
bluejackets
and
the
american
sailors
foregather
you
must
stir
up
bad
blood
i
do
not
pretend
to
give
you
any
more
precise
direction
than
this
let
the
americans
understand
that
the
british
call
them
cowards
let
the
british
think
the
same
of
the
yankees
let
there
be
bitter
street
fights
not
in
obscure
drinking
dens
but
in
the
public
streets
in
the
light
of
day
i
will
see
to
it
that
the
news
gets
back
here
and
let
americans
have
something
to
think
about
when
the
next
draft
is
raised
find
men
in
england
to
do
what
you
must
do
in
your
own
country
let
there
be
black
blood
between
briton
and
american
from
belfast
to
portsmouth
let
there
be
doubt
and
recrimination
so
that
preparations
are
hindered
the
man
who
passed
as
williams
looked
venomous
as
he
said
this
the
man
to
whom
he
spoke
thinking
in
his
ignorance
that
he
was
indeed
helping
his
native
land
instead
of
hurting
it
and
forgetful
that
in
aiding
the
enemies
of
america
he
was
stabbing
a
country
which
had
ever
been
a
faithful
friend
of
erin
s
gave
particulars
of
his
operations
which
trent
memorized
as
best
he
might
he
was
appalled
to
hear
to
what
length
these
men
were
prepared
to
go
if
only
the
good
relations
between
the
allies
might
be
brought
to
naught
so
engrossed
was
he
with
the
importance
of
what
he
heard
that
the
passing
of
the
large
sum
of
money
from
williams
to
the
sinn
feiner
lost
much
of
its
entrancing
interest
trent
meant
to
have
the
money
but
he
intended
also
to
give
the
department
of
justice
what
help
he
could
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
he
had
gone
from
one
floor
to
another
by
means
of
a
dumbwaiter
it
was
never
an
easy
operation
and
rarely
a
noiseless
one
in
this
instance
he
was
fortunate
in
finding
pulleys
it
was
only
when
he
stepped
out
in
the
kitchen
that
he
ran
into
danger
there
was
a
man
asleep
on
a
folding
bed
which
had
been
drawn
across
the
door
to
leave
by
the
front
door
immediately
was
imperative
even
were
it
possible
to
leave
by
a
rear
entrance
he
would
find
himself
in
the
little
garden
at
the
back
and
could
only
get
out
by
climbing
a
dozen
fences
this
would
be
to
court
observation
and
run
unnecessary
risks
to
invite
electrocution
by
killing
men
was
no
part
of
anthony
trent
s
practice
it
was
plain
that
the
servant
was
slumbering
fitfully
and
the
act
of
stepping
over
him
to
freedom
likely
to
awaken
him
instantly
even
if
he
had
the
needed
rope
at
hand
binding
and
gagging
a
vigorous
man
was
at
best
a
matter
of
noise
and
struggle
but
something
had
to
be
done
he
must
reach
the
street
in
time
to
follow
o
sheill
superimposed
on
the
bed
s
frame
was
a
mattress
and
army
blanket
directly
behind
the
sleeper
s
head
was
a
door
which
led
as
trent
knew
from
his
knowledge
of
house
design
to
the
cellar
it
opened
inward
and
without
noise
he
bent
quietly
over
the
man
put
his
hands
gently
beneath
the
mattress
and
then
with
a
tremendous
effort
flung
him
mattress
army
blanket
and
all
down
the
cellar
stairs
there
was
a
clatter
of
breaking
bottles
a
cry
that
died
away
almost
as
it
was
uttered
and
then
the
door
was
shut
on
silence
a
little
later
williams
feeling
the
need
for
iced
beer
and
cheese
sandwiches
rang
the
bell
for
fritz
when
he
received
no
answer
he
descended
to
the
kitchen
with
the
intention
of
buffeting
soundly
a
man
who
could
so
forget
his
duties
to
his
superiors
williams
found
only
the
bare
bed
fritz
with
his
bedding
had
disappeared
a
front
door
unlocked
when
instructions
had
been
exact
as
to
the
necessity
of
its
careful
fastening
at
all
hours
brought
uneasy
conjectures
to
his
mind
it
was
only
so
long
as
he
and
his
companions
were
invested
with
the
immunity
of
neutrality
that
he
was
of
value
to
his
native
land
of
late
he
had
been
conscious
of
secret
service
activities
obedient
to
his
training
williams
instantly
reported
the
matter
to
the
thin
man
under
whose
instructions
he
had
been
commanded
to
act
they
have
taken
fritz
away
he
cried
who
demanded
his
superior
the
secret
service
said
williams
wildly
he
was
now
beginning
to
ascribe
aggressive
skill
to
a
service
at
which
he
had
formerly
sneered
going
down
to
the
kitchen
they
were
startled
by
a
feeble
cry
from
the
cellar
there
they
discovered
the
frightened
fritz
cut
about
the
face
from
the
bottles
he
had
broken
in
his
fall
his
injuries
gave
him
less
concern
than
the
admission
he
had
slept
at
his
post
he
was
therefore
of
no
aid
to
them
i
do
not
know
he
repeated
as
they
questioned
him
there
must
have
been
many
of
them
one
man
alone
could
not
do
the
thin
man
turned
to
williams
this
o
sheill
is
in
danger
arm
yourself
and
go
to
his
hotel
it
will
go
badly
with
you
if
harm
comes
to
chapter
xii
the
sinn
fein
plot
fortunately
for
o
sheill
s
peace
of
mind
he
left
the
house
before
williams
made
his
discovery
he
stepped
into
the
street
painfully
conscious
of
the
large
sum
of
money
he
carried
it
seemed
to
him
that
every
man
looked
at
him
suspiciously
a
request
for
a
match
was
met
with
an
oath
and
the
two
women
who
asked
him
the
location
of
a
certain
hotel
drew
back
nervously
at
his
scowl
he
boarded
the
elevated
at
the
street
station
and
alighted
at
ninth
avenue
and
street
still
glancing
about
him
suspiciously
it
was
not
until
he
was
in
his
room
on
the
top
floor
of
a
cheap
and
old
hotel
on
the
far
west
side
that
he
ventured
to
feel
safe
he
sighed
with
relief
as
he
stuffed
a
dublin
clay
with
malodorous
shag
twenty
thousand
dollars
four
thousand
pounds
some
would
go
to
the
traitorous
work
he
was
employed
to
prosecute
but
a
lot
of
it
would
go
to
satisfy
private
hates
and
when
it
was
exhausted
there
would
be
more
to
come
it
would
be
easy
to
conceal
the
notes
about
his
person
and
anyway
he
reflected
he
was
not
under
suspicion
he
was
aroused
from
his
reveries
by
the
sudden
gentle
tapping
on
his
door
after
a
few
seconds
of
hesitation
he
called
out
what
is
it
ye
want
the
voice
that
answered
him
was
strongly
tinged
with
the
german
accent
to
which
he
had
recently
become
used
it
will
not
be
forgotten
that
anthony
trent
had
a
genius
for
mimicry
i
m
from
williams
said
the
stranger
gutturally
he
had
followed
o
sheill
with
no
difficulty
what
s
your
name
o
sheill
demanded
we
won
t
give
names
trent
reminded
him
significantly
but
i
can
prove
my
identity
i
was
in
the
house
at
street
when
you
came
the
money
was
given
you
to
stir
up
trouble
in
ireland
and
circulate
rumors
that
will
embarrass
the
british
government
and
made
bad
blood
between
english
and
american
sailors
you
have
twenty
bills
and
you
put
them
in
a
green
oilskin
that
s
right
o
sheill
admitted
but
what
do
you
want
he
was
filled
with
a
vague
uneasiness
this
young
man
seemed
so
terribly
in
earnest
and
his
eyes
darted
from
door
to
window
and
window
to
door
as
though
he
feared
interruption
mr
williams
sent
me
here
to
see
if
you
had
been
followed
directly
you
went
we
had
information
from
an
agent
of
ours
that
your
visit
was
known
to
the
secret
service
tell
me
did
any
person
speak
to
you
on
your
way
here
no
answered
o
sheill
now
thoroughly
nervous
by
the
other
s
anxiety
are
you
sure
he
was
asked
there
was
one
fellow
who
asked
me
for
a
light
but
i
told
him
to
go
to
hell
and
get
anything
suspicious
about
him
trent
demanded
not
that
i
could
that
will
be
good
news
for
williams
trent
returned
our
agent
said
the
hunchback
was
on
the
who
s
he
o
sheill
said
one
of
our
most
dangerous
enemies
the
younger
man
retorted
he
s
a
man
of
forty
but
looks
younger
he
had
one
shoulder
higher
than
the
other
and
he
limps
when
he
walks
he
s
the
man
we
re
afraid
of
i
think
we
have
alarmed
ourselves
o
sheill
s
face
was
no
longer
merely
uneasy
he
was
and
i
guess
we
haven
t
he
exclaimed
man
who
asked
me
for
a
light
was
a
there
was
two
women
who
asked
me
the
way
to
some
blasted
hotel
they
looked
at
me
as
if
they
wanted
never
to
forget
my
stop
a
minute
said
trent
gravely
answer
me
exactly
about
these
women
i
want
to
know
in
what
danger
we
all
stand
the
only
two
women
known
by
sight
to
us
who
are
likely
to
be
put
on
a
case
of
this
kind
wouldn
t
look
like
detectives
there
s
daniels
and
miss
barrett
they
work
as
mother
and
daughter
daniels
is
tall
and
slight
with
a
big
nose
for
a
woman
and
eyes
set
close
together
when
she
looks
at
you
it
seems
as
if
the
eyes
were
gimlets
the
girl
is
pretty
reddish
hair
and
laughing
trent
paused
for
a
moment
to
think
of
any
other
attributes
he
could
ascribe
to
the
unknown
women
he
had
directed
to
their
hotel
just
after
o
sheill
had
scowled
at
them
a
half
hour
back
and
very
white
little
my
god
cried
o
sheill
his
arms
dropping
at
his
side
that
s
them
to
the
life
what
s
going
to
happen
to
me
if
they
find
you
with
that
money
you
ll
be
deported
and
handed
over
to
your
british
friends
how
can
you
explain
having
twenty
thousand
dollars
williams
thought
of
that
but
he
didn
t
actually
know
they
were
on
your
trail
you
must
give
me
the
money
i
shan
t
be
stopped
you
are
to
stay
here
they
may
be
here
in
five
minutes
or
they
may
wait
till
morning
but
you
may
be
certain
that
you
won
t
be
allowed
to
get
away
you
must
claim
to
be
just
over
here
to
get
an
insight
into
labor
williams
messenger
chuckled
i
don
t
believe
they
can
get
anything
on
but
if
they
do
o
sheill
demanded
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
stranger
s
levity
was
singularly
if
they
do
trent
advised
you
must
remember
that
you
re
a
british
subject
still
whether
you
like
it
or
not
and
you
have
certain
inalienable
rights
immediately
appeal
to
the
british
authorities
give
the
earl
of
reading
some
work
to
do
make
the
here
stir
himself
tell
them
you
came
over
here
to
investigate
labor
conditions
that
story
goes
any
time
and
just
now
it
s
fashionable
as
an
irishman
you
ll
have
far
more
consideration
from
the
british
government
than
if
you
were
merely
an
but
what
about
this
money
o
sheill
queried
uneasily
i
ll
take
it
trent
told
him
if
it
s
found
on
you
nothing
can
do
you
any
good
you
ll
do
your
plotting
in
a
british
o
sheill
was
amazed
at
the
careless
manner
in
which
this
large
sum
was
thrust
into
the
other
man
s
pocket
surely
these
accomplices
of
his
dealt
in
big
things
when
you
re
ready
to
sail
you
can
get
it
back
trent
continued
that
can
be
arranged
later
meanwhile
don
t
forget
my
instructions
be
indignant
when
you
are
searched
call
on
the
british
trent
paused
suddenly
an
idea
had
struck
him
by
the
way
he
went
on
you
have
other
things
that
would
get
you
into
trouble
beside
that
i
know
it
o
sheill
admitted
what
am
i
to
do
with
them
i
m
taking
a
chance
if
they
are
found
on
me
the
younger
man
commented
but
they
are
not
after
me
give
me
what
you
have
he
cried
into
this
keeping
the
frightened
o
sheill
confided
certain
letters
which
later
were
to
prove
such
an
admirable
aid
to
the
united
states
government
it
was
as
trent
turned
to
the
door
that
he
heard
steps
coming
along
the
passage
as
softly
as
the
creaking
boards
permitted
he
placed
his
fingers
on
his
lips
and
enjoined
silence
the
furtive
sound
completed
o
sheill
s
distress
he
felt
himself
entrapped
trent
saw
him
take
from
his
hip
pocket
a
revolver
not
yet
he
whispered
he
turned
down
the
gas
to
a
tiny
glimmer
through
the
transom
the
stronger
light
in
the
passage
was
seen
it
was
but
a
slight
effort
for
the
muscular
trent
to
draw
himself
up
so
that
he
could
peer
through
the
transom
at
the
man
tapping
softly
at
the
door
unquestionably
it
was
williams
and
the
hand
concealed
in
his
right
hand
coat
pocket
was
no
doubt
gripping
the
butt
of
an
automatic
he
was
a
man
of
great
physical
strength
that
trent
had
noted
earlier
in
the
evening
although
of
enormous
strength
himself
and
a
boxer
and
wrestler
he
knew
he
would
stand
no
chance
if
these
two
discovered
his
errand
there
was
no
other
exit
than
the
door
anthony
trent
stepped
silently
to
o
sheill
s
side
it
s
the
hunchback
he
whispered
if
once
he
gets
those
long
fingers
around
your
throat
you
re
gone
listen
to
me
i
m
going
to
turn
the
gas
out
then
i
shall
open
the
door
when
he
rushes
in
get
him
if
he
gets
you
instead
i
ll
be
on
the
top
of
him
and
we
ll
tie
him
up
ready
the
prospect
of
a
fight
restored
o
sheill
s
spirits
every
line
of
his
evil
face
was
a
black
menace
to
friedrich
wilhelm
outside
don
t
use
your
revolver
anthony
trent
cautioned
why
o
sheill
whispered
we
can
t
stand
police
investigation
said
the
other
get
ready
now
i
m
going
to
open
the
when
he
flung
it
open
williams
stepped
quickly
in
o
sheill
maddened
at
the
very
thought
that
any
one
imperiled
his
money
could
only
see
in
the
dim
light
an
enemy
the
first
blow
he
struck
landed
fair
and
square
on
the
prussian
nose
on
his
part
williams
supposed
the
attack
a
premeditated
one
o
sheill
was
playing
him
false
the
pain
of
the
blow
awoke
his
own
hot
temper
and
made
him
killing
mad
he
sought
to
get
his
strong
arms
about
the
sinn
feiner
s
throat
it
was
while
they
thrashed
about
on
the
floor
that
anthony
trent
made
his
escape
he
closed
the
door
of
the
room
carefully
and
locked
it
from
the
outside
then
he
unscrewed
the
electric
bulb
that
lit
the
hall
none
saw
him
pass
into
the
street
it
was
one
of
his
triumphant
nights
next
morning
at
breakfast
he
found
kinney
much
interested
in
the
city
s
police
news
as
set
forth
in
the
papers
he
was
singularly
cheerful
what
is
it
he
demanded
some
very
dreadful
crime
a
double
murder
she
told
him
and
the
police
don
t
seem
to
be
able
to
figure
it
out
at
trent
sipped
his
coffee
gratefully
what
s
strange
about
that
he
demanded
i
don
t
see
kinney
went
on
what
a
gentleman
like
this
williams
seems
to
have
been
anthony
trent
put
down
his
cup
what
s
his
other
name
he
inquired
frederick
said
the
interested
kinney
frederick
williams
a
holland
dutch
gentleman
living
in
street
near
the
drive
he
aided
the
red
cross
and
bought
liberty
bonds
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
he
went
to
a
low
place
like
the
shipwrights
hotel
to
see
a
man
named
o
sheill
from
liverpool
england
a
double
murder
he
demanded
here
it
is
she
returned
and
showed
him
the
paper
the
two
men
had
been
found
dead
the
report
ran
under
mysterious
circumstances
but
the
police
thought
a
solution
would
quickly
be
found
anthony
trent
smiled
as
he
read
of
official
optimism
he
was
inclined
to
doubt
it
when
kinney
was
out
shopping
he
read
through
the
documents
he
had
taken
from
o
sheill
they
seemed
to
him
to
be
of
prime
importance
there
was
a
list
of
american
sinn
feiners
implicating
men
in
high
positions
men
against
whom
so
far
nothing
detrimental
was
known
outlines
of
plots
were
made
bare
to
embroil
and
antagonize
britain
and
the
united
states
allies
in
the
great
cause
and
all
that
subtle
propaganda
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
betterment
of
prosperous
ireland
but
everything
to
do
with
prussian
aggrandizement
it
was
a
poisonous
collection
of
documents
the
chief
of
the
department
of
justice
in
new
york
was
called
up
from
a
public
station
and
informed
that
a
messenger
was
on
his
way
with
very
important
papers
the
chief
was
warned
to
make
immediate
search
of
the
premises
at
street
where
a
highly
important
german
spy
might
be
captured
in
the
evening
papers
anthony
trent
was
gratified
to
learn
that
the
thin
haughty
person
was
none
other
than
the
baron
von
reisende
who
had
received
his
with
bernstorff
and
was
thought
to
be
in
the
wilmhelmstrasse
he
had
probably
returned
by
way
of
mexico
and
certain
politicians
of
the
baser
sort
were
sternly
warned
against
plotting
the
downfall
of
america
s
allies
altogether
trent
had
done
a
good
night
s
work
for
his
country
as
for
himself
twenty
thousand
dollars
went
far
toward
making
the
total
he
desired
consistent
success
in
such
enterprises
as
his
was
leading
him
into
a
feeling
that
he
would
not
be
run
to
earth
as
had
been
those
lesser
practitioners
of
crime
who
lacked
his
subtlety
and
shared
their
secrets
with
others
but
there
was
always
the
chance
that
he
had
been
observed
when
he
thought
he
was
alone
in
some
great
house
austin
the
conington
warren
butler
looked
him
full
in
the
face
on
his
first
adventure
and
that
other
butler
who
served
the
millionaire
whose
piano
he
had
wrecked
might
some
day
place
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
denounce
him
to
the
world
yet
butlers
were
beings
whose
duties
took
them
little
abroad
they
did
not
greatly
perturb
him
chapter
xiii
anthony
trent
interests
himself
in
police
gossip
so
far
as
he
knew
none
suspected
him
his
face
had
been
seen
on
one
or
two
occasions
but
he
was
of
a
type
common
among
young
americans
of
the
educated
classes
above
middle
height
slenderly
fashioned
but
he
had
a
shrewd
humorous
face
with
strongly
marked
features
it
might
be
that
the
nose
was
a
trifle
large
and
the
mouth
a
trifle
tight
but
none
looking
at
him
would
say
there
goes
a
they
would
say
rather
there
goes
a
resourceful
young
business
man
who
can
rise
to
any
since
trent
had
calculated
everything
to
a
nicety
he
knew
he
must
during
these
harvesting
years
deny
himself
the
privilege
of
friendship
with
other
men
or
women
too
many
of
his
gild
had
lost
their
liberty
through
some
errant
desire
to
be
confidential
this
habit
of
solitude
was
trying
to
a
man
naturally
of
a
sociable
nature
but
he
determined
that
it
could
be
cast
from
him
as
one
throws
away
an
old
coat
when
he
was
a
burglar
emeritus
that
blessed
moment
had
arrived
he
even
looked
up
an
old
editor
friend
the
man
who
had
first
put
into
his
mind
that
he
could
make
more
money
at
burglary
than
in
writing
fiction
it
s
good
to
see
you
again
cried
the
editor
i
often
wish
you
hadn
t
been
left
money
by
that
australian
uncle
of
yours
so
that
you
could
still
write
those
corking
crook
yarns
for
us
there
was
never
any
one
like
you
i
was
talking
about
you
at
the
scribblers
club
dinner
the
other
trent
frowned
publicity
was
a
thing
to
avoid
and
this
particular
editor
had
always
been
ready
to
sound
his
praise
the
editor
had
once
before
asked
him
to
join
this
little
club
made
up
of
professional
writers
they
were
men
he
would
have
delighted
to
know
under
other
conditions
be
my
guest
next
tuesday
the
editor
persisted
i
m
toastmaster
and
the
subject
is
crime
in
i
told
the
boys
i
d
get
you
to
speak
if
i
possibly
could
i
m
counting
on
you
will
you
do
it
it
seemed
a
deliciously
ironical
thing
here
was
an
honest
editor
asking
the
friend
he
did
not
know
to
be
a
master
criminal
to
make
an
address
on
crime
in
fiction
trent
laughed
the
noiseless
laugh
he
had
cultivated
in
place
of
the
one
that
was
in
reality
the
expression
of
himself
the
editor
thought
it
a
good
sign
who
are
the
other
speakers
trent
demanded
oppenheim
phelps
for
one
he
s
over
here
on
a
visit
his
specialty
is
international
spy
stuff
as
you
know
hornung
would
be
the
man
to
have
if
we
could
get
him
but
that
s
impossible
i
ve
got
half
a
dozen
others
but
phelps
and
you
will
be
the
drawing
put
me
down
trent
said
genially
but
introduce
me
as
a
back
number
almost
out
of
touch
with
things
but
willing
to
oblige
a
he
laughed
again
his
noiseless
laugh
crosbeigh
looked
at
him
meditatively
certainly
anthony
trent
was
changed
in
the
old
days
before
he
came
into
australian
money
he
was
at
times
jocund
with
the
fruitful
grape
a
good
fellow
a
raconteur
one
who
had
been
popular
at
school
and
college
and
liked
to
stand
well
with
his
fellows
but
now
crosbeigh
reflected
he
was
changed
there
was
a
certain
suspicion
about
him
a
lack
of
trust
in
men
s
motives
it
was
the
attitude
no
doubt
which
wealth
brought
the
moneyless
man
can
meet
a
borrower
cheerfully
and
need
cudgel
his
mind
for
no
other
excuse
than
his
poverty
crosbeigh
was
certain
trent
had
a
lot
of
money
for
the
reason
he
had
actually
refused
four
cents
a
word
for
what
he
had
previously
received
only
two
cents
but
the
editor
admired
his
old
contributor
and
was
glad
to
see
him
again
i
m
going
to
spring
a
surprise
on
you
crosbeigh
declared
and
i
m
willing
to
bet
you
ll
enjoy
i
hope
so
trent
returned
idly
and
little
dreamed
what
lay
before
him
the
dinner
was
at
a
chop
house
and
the
food
no
worse
than
the
run
of
city
restaurants
anthony
trent
who
had
fared
delicately
for
some
time
put
up
with
the
viands
readily
enough
for
the
pleasure
of
being
again
among
men
of
the
craft
which
had
been
his
own
oppenheim
phelps
was
interesting
he
was
introduced
as
a
historian
who
had
made
his
name
at
fiction
it
was
a
satisfaction
he
said
to
find
that
modern
events
had
justified
him
the
reviewers
had
formerly
treated
him
with
patronizing
airs
they
had
called
his
secret
diplomacy
and
german
as
chimeras
only
when
they
had
shown
themselves
to
be
transcripts
and
not
exaggerated
ones
at
that
of
what
had
taken
place
during
the
last
few
years
anthony
trent
sat
next
to
the
english
novelist
and
liked
him
it
brought
him
close
to
the
war
to
talk
to
a
man
whose
home
had
been
bombed
from
air
and
submarine
and
phelps
was
also
a
golfer
and
asked
trent
when
the
war
was
over
to
visit
his
own
beloved
links
at
cromer
it
had
grown
so
late
when
the
particularly
prosy
member
of
the
club
had
made
his
speech
that
crosbeigh
came
apologetically
to
trent
s
side
i
m
afraid
old
man
he
began
that
it
s
too
late
for
any
more
speeches
except
the
surprise
one
a
lot
of
us
commute
do
you
mind
speaking
at
our
next
meeting
instead
not
a
bit
trent
said
cheerfully
but
he
felt
as
all
speakers
do
under
these
circumstances
that
his
speech
would
have
been
a
brilliant
one
he
had
coined
a
number
of
epigrams
as
other
speakers
had
plowed
laboriously
along
their
lingual
way
and
now
they
were
to
be
but
he
soon
forgot
them
when
crosbeigh
announced
the
surprise
speaker
i
have
been
very
fortunate
crosbeigh
began
in
getting
a
man
who
knows
more
of
the
ways
of
crooks
than
any
living
authority
gentlemen
you
all
know
inspector
mcwalsh
well
boys
said
the
inspector
i
guess
a
good
many
of
you
know
me
by
he
had
risen
to
his
full
height
and
looked
about
him
genially
he
had
imbibed
just
the
right
amount
to
bring
him
to
this
stage
three
highballs
later
he
would
be
looking
for
insults
but
he
was
now
ripe
with
good
humor
he
had
come
because
conington
warren
had
asked
him
to
oblige
crosbeigh
for
writers
on
crime
he
had
the
usual
contempt
of
the
professional
policeman
and
he
was
fluent
in
his
denunciation
you
boys
he
went
on
make
me
smile
with
your
modern
scientific
criminals
the
guys
what
use
chemistry
and
electricity
and
and
so
forth
i
ve
been
a
policeman
now
for
thirty
years
and
i
never
run
across
any
of
that
stuff
inspector
mcwalsh
poured
his
unsubtle
scorn
on
such
writings
for
ten
full
minutes
but
he
added
nothing
to
the
scribblers
knowledge
of
his
subject
it
chanced
that
the
writer
he
had
taken
as
his
victim
was
a
guest
at
the
dinner
this
fictioneer
pursued
the
latest
writings
on
physicist
and
chemical
research
so
that
he
might
embroider
his
tales
therewith
personally
trent
was
bored
by
this
artificial
type
of
story
but
as
between
writer
and
policeman
he
was
always
for
the
writer
the
writer
was
plainly
angry
but
the
gods
had
not
blessed
him
with
a
ready
tongue
and
he
was
prepared
to
sit
silent
under
mcwalsh
s
scorn
some
mischievous
devil
prompted
anthony
trent
to
rise
to
his
aid
it
was
a
bold
thing
to
do
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
man
who
had
been
in
charge
of
the
detectives
sent
to
run
him
to
earth
but
of
late
excitement
had
been
lacking
inspector
mcwalsh
he
commenced
possesses
precisely
that
type
of
mind
one
would
expect
to
find
in
a
successful
policeman
he
has
that
absolute
absence
of
imagination
without
which
one
can
not
attain
his
rank
in
the
force
all
he
has
done
in
his
speech
is
to
pour
his
scorn
of
a
certain
type
of
crime
story
on
its
author
as
writers
we
are
sorry
if
inspector
mcwalsh
never
heard
of
the
einthoven
string
galvanometer
upon
which
the
solution
of
the
story
he
ridicules
rests
yet
we
know
it
to
exist
were
i
a
criminal
instead
of
a
writer
i
should
enjoy
to
cross
swords
with
men
who
think
as
the
inspector
does
i
could
outguess
them
every
who
is
this
guy
inspector
mcwalsh
demanded
loudly
anthony
trent
crosbeigh
whispered
he
wrote
some
wonderful
crook
stories
a
few
years
ago
dealing
with
a
crook
called
conway
what
one
would
expect
to
hear
from
a
man
with
mcwalsh
s
opportunities
to
deal
with
crime
is
some
of
the
difficulty
he
experiences
in
his
work
there
must
be
difficulty
we
know
by
statistics
what
crimes
are
committed
and
what
criminals
brought
to
justice
what
happens
to
the
crooks
who
remain
safe
from
arrest
by
reason
of
superior
skill
i
ll
tell
you
gentlemen
they
live
well
and
snap
their
fingers
at
men
like
the
last
speaker
there
is
such
a
thing
as
fatty
degeneration
of
the
brain
inspector
mcwalsh
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
roar
i
didn
t
come
here
to
be
i
am
not
insulting
a
guest
trent
went
on
equably
i
am
asking
him
to
tell
us
interesting
things
of
his
professional
work
instead
of
giving
his
opinion
on
modern
science
i
met
mcwalsh
years
ago
when
i
covered
mulberry
street
for
the
he
was
captain
then
let
him
entertain
us
with
some
of
the
reasons
why
the
ashy
bennet
murderer
was
never
caught
you
remember
gentlemen
that
bennet
was
shot
down
on
park
row
at
midday
then
the
thoroughbred
racer
foxkeen
was
poisoned
in
his
stall
at
sheepshead
bay
why
was
that
crime
never
punished
i
remember
a
dozen
others
where
the
police
have
been
beaten
coming
down
to
the
present
time
there
is
the
robbery
of
the
house
of
the
genial
sportsman
inspector
mcwalsh
tells
us
he
is
proud
to
call
his
friend
conington
warren
how
was
it
the
burglar
or
burglars
were
allowed
to
escape
trent
was
enjoying
himself
hugely
i
have
a
right
to
demand
protection
of
the
new
york
police
in
my
own
humble
home
i
have
valuables
bequeathed
me
by
an
uncle
in
australia
which
are
never
safe
while
such
men
as
snap
their
fingers
at
the
police
are
at
large
let
inspector
mcwalsh
tell
us
why
his
men
fail
it
will
help
us
perhaps
to
understand
the
difficulties
under
which
they
labor
it
may
help
us
to
appreciate
the
silent
unadvertised
work
of
the
police
the
inspector
is
a
good
sport
who
loves
a
race
horse
and
a
good
glove
fight
as
much
as
i
do
myself
i
assure
him
he
will
make
us
grateful
if
he
will
take
the
hint
of
a
humble
the
applause
which
followed
gratified
the
inspector
enormously
he
thought
it
was
evidence
of
his
popularity
a
tribute
to
his
known
fondness
for
the
race
tracks
his
anger
melted
boys
he
shouted
rising
to
his
feet
and
waving
a
larranaga
to
the
applauders
i
guess
he
s
right
and
i
hope
the
fellow
who
writes
that
scientific
dope
will
accept
my
word
that
it
wasn
t
personal
of
course
we
do
have
difficulties
i
admit
it
i
had
charge
of
that
ashy
bennet
murder
and
i
d
give
a
thousand
dollars
to
be
able
to
put
my
hand
on
the
man
who
done
it
as
to
foxkeen
i
had
a
thousand
on
him
to
win
at
and
when
he
was
poisoned
the
odds
were
shortening
every
minute
so
you
can
guess
i
was
sore
on
the
skunk
who
poisoned
him
the
police
of
all
countries
fail
and
they
fail
the
most
in
countries
where
people
have
most
sympathy
with
crime
boys
you
know
you
all
like
a
clever
crook
to
get
away
with
it
it
s
human
nature
we
ain
t
helped
all
we
could
be
and
you
know
it
we
gentlemen
of
the
police
he
quoted
austin
s
words
glibly
we
make
mistakes
sometimes
we
get
the
ordinary
crook
easy
enough
if
you
don
t
believe
me
get
a
permit
to
look
over
sing
sing
the
crimes
the
last
speaker
mentioned
were
committed
by
clever
men
they
get
away
with
it
the
clever
ones
do
get
away
with
things
for
a
bit
but
if
the
guy
who
croaked
bennet
tried
murder
again
the
odds
are
we
d
gather
him
in
same
with
the
man
or
men
who
put
strychnine
in
foxkeen
s
oats
the
clever
ones
get
careless
that
s
our
the
inspector
lighted
a
new
cigar
sipped
his
highball
and
came
back
to
his
speech
boys
i
m
not
rich
no
honest
cop
is
but
i
d
give
a
lot
of
money
to
get
my
hands
on
a
gentleman
crook
who
s
operating
right
now
in
this
city
i
ve
got
a
list
of
seven
tricks
i
m
certain
he
done
himself
he
s
got
inspector
mcwalsh
turned
purple
red
dammit
he
made
me
an
accomplice
to
one
of
his
crimes
yes
sir
he
made
me
carry
a
vase
worth
ten
thousand
dollars
out
of
senator
scrivener
s
house
on
fifth
avenue
and
hand
it
to
him
in
his
taxi
he
had
a
silk
hat
a
cane
and
a
coat
and
he
asked
me
to
hold
the
vase
for
a
moment
while
he
put
his
coat
on
i
thought
he
was
a
friend
of
the
senator
so
i
trotted
down
the
hall
there
was
a
big
reception
on
down
the
steps
past
my
own
men
on
watch
for
this
very
crook
or
some
one
like
him
and
handed
it
through
the
window
none
of
my
men
thought
of
questioning
him
why
did
he
do
it
you
wonder
he
did
it
because
he
thought
some
one
have
seen
him
swipe
it
the
thing
was
thousands
of
years
old
and
if
any
of
you
find
it
senator
scrivener
stands
ready
to
give
you
five
thousand
dollars
reward
i
believe
he
took
the
inspector
mcwalsh
stopped
he
thought
it
wiser
to
say
no
more
that
s
about
all
now
he
concluded
then
with
a
flourish
he
added
gentlemen
i
thank
mcwalsh
sat
down
with
the
thunder
of
applause
ringing
gratefully
in
his
ears
and
none
applauded
more
heartily
than
anthony
trent
chapter
xiv
ambulances
and
diamonds
there
was
an
opportunity
later
on
to
visit
the
scribblers
again
crosbeigh
begged
him
to
come
as
he
desired
a
full
attendance
in
honor
of
an
occasion
unique
in
the
club
s
history
it
seemed
that
some
soldier
members
of
the
club
foregathering
in
new
york
offered
the
opportunity
for
a
meeting
that
might
never
recur
the
toastmaster
was
a
former
officer
and
the
speakers
were
men
who
had
fought
through
the
ghastly
early
years
of
the
war
before
the
united
states
came
into
it
it
happened
that
trent
had
known
the
toastmaster
captain
alan
kent
when
the
two
had
been
newspaper
cubs
together
in
those
days
kent
had
been
an
irresponsible
youngster
liked
by
all
for
his
carefree
disposition
after
three
years
of
war
he
was
a
sterner
man
in
whose
eyes
shone
steadily
the
conviction
of
the
cause
he
had
espoused
war
had
purged
the
dross
from
him
you
boys
here
he
said
haven
t
suffered
enough
you
haven
t
seen
nations
in
agony
as
we
have
the
theater
of
war
is
still
too
remote
the
loss
of
a
transport
wakens
you
to
renewed
effort
for
a
moment
and
then
you
get
back
to
thinking
of
other
things
more
agreeable
things
and
speculate
as
to
when
the
war
will
be
over
i
ve
spoken
to
rich
men
who
seem
to
think
they
ve
done
all
that
is
required
of
them
by
purchasing
a
few
liberty
bonds
they
must
be
bought
if
we
are
to
win
the
war
but
there
s
little
of
the
personal
element
of
sacrifice
in
merely
buying
he
launched
into
a
description
of
war
as
he
had
seen
it
dwelling
on
the
character
it
developed
rather
than
the
horrors
he
had
suffered
horrors
such
as
are
depicted
in
the
widely
circulated
book
of
henri
barbusse
this
mention
of
negative
patriotism
rather
disturbed
anthony
trent
all
he
had
done
was
to
buy
liberty
bonds
and
here
was
alan
kent
who
had
lived
through
three
years
of
hell
to
come
back
full
of
courage
and
cheer
and
anxious
when
his
health
was
reestablished
to
leave
the
british
service
and
enroll
in
the
armies
of
america
it
was
not
agreeable
for
him
to
think
how
he
had
passed
those
three
years
he
was
awakened
from
these
unpleasant
thoughts
by
the
applause
which
followed
kent
s
speech
the
next
speaker
was
an
ambulance
driver
who
made
a
plea
for
more
and
yet
more
ambulances
lots
of
you
people
here
he
said
seem
to
think
that
when
once
a
battery
of
ambulances
are
donated
they
are
there
till
the
war
is
over
they
suffer
as
much
as
guns
or
horses
the
huns
get
special
marks
over
there
for
potting
an
ambulance
and
they
re
getting
to
be
experts
at
the
game
i
ve
had
three
of
hen
ford
s
little
masterpieces
shot
under
me
so
to
speak
i
m
trying
to
interest
individuals
in
giving
ambulances
they
re
not
very
expensive
you
can
equip
one
for
men
have
said
to
me
what
s
the
use
of
one
ambulance
i
tell
them
as
i
tell
you
that
the
one
they
may
send
will
do
its
work
before
it
s
knocked
out
it
may
pick
up
a
brother
or
pal
of
a
man
in
this
room
it
may
pick
up
some
of
you
boys
even
for
some
of
you
are
going
god
it
makes
me
tired
this
cry
of
what
s
the
use
of
one
little
when
the
dinner
was
over
trent
renewed
his
acquaintance
with
captain
kent
and
was
introduced
to
lincoln
the
harvardian
driver
of
an
ambulance
over
coffee
in
the
pirates
den
lincoln
told
them
more
of
his
work
this
afternoon
he
said
i
had
tea
with
the
baroness
von
eckstein
you
know
who
she
is
trent
nodded
the
baroness
was
the
enormously
wealthy
widow
of
a
louis
brewer
who
had
married
a
westphalian
noble
and
hoped
thereby
to
get
into
new
york
and
washington
society
the
baron
had
been
willing
to
sell
his
title
not
an
old
one
for
all
the
comforts
of
a
wealthy
home
he
had
become
naturalized
and
was
not
suspected
by
the
department
of
justice
of
treachery
his
one
ambition
seemed
to
be
to
drink
himself
to
death
on
the
best
cognac
that
could
be
obtained
this
potent
brew
taken
half
and
half
with
champagne
seemed
likely
to
do
its
work
it
was
rumored
that
his
wife
did
not
hinder
him
in
this
interesting
pursuit
i
sat
behind
him
at
a
theater
once
trent
admitted
he
s
a
thin
little
man
with
an
enormous
head
and
a
strong
prussian
he
resisted
the
temptation
to
mimic
the
baron
as
he
could
have
done
he
could
not
readily
banish
his
professional
caution
i
tried
to
get
the
baroness
to
buy
and
equip
four
ambulances
lincoln
went
on
it
would
only
have
cost
her
twenty
thousand
dollars
nothing
to
her
but
she
before
we
went
into
the
war
captain
kent
reminded
him
she
was
strongly
she
s
had
enough
sense
to
stop
that
talk
in
new
york
lincoln
went
on
she
s
still
trying
to
break
into
the
four
hundred
and
you
ve
got
to
be
loyal
to
your
country
for
that
thank
god
i
thought
she
was
in
louis
trent
observed
she
s
taken
a
house
in
town
lincoln
told
him
the
burton
trent
mansion
on
washington
square
north
took
it
furnished
for
three
months
she
had
to
pay
like
the
deuce
for
the
privilege
unkindly
remarks
that
she
did
it
so
some
of
the
burton
trents
friends
may
call
on
her
thinking
they
are
visiting
the
trents
it
s
the
nearest
she
ll
ever
get
to
high
society
it
made
me
sick
to
hear
her
hard
luck
story
couldn
t
give
me
a
measly
twenty
thousand
dollars
because
of
income
tax
and
high
cost
of
living
and
all
that
sort
of
bunk
while
she
had
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
diamonds
on
her
fat
neck
i
felt
like
pulling
them
off
anthony
trent
pricked
up
his
ears
at
this
i
didn
t
know
she
had
a
necklace
of
that
value
he
mused
i
guess
you
don
t
know
much
about
the
fortunes
these
millionaire
women
hang
all
over
em
said
lincoln
lincoln
had
an
idea
the
other
man
was
a
bookish
scholar
a
collector
of
rare
editions
one
removed
from
knowledge
of
society
life
that
must
be
it
trent
agreed
he
wondered
if
another
man
in
all
america
had
so
intimate
a
knowledge
of
the
disposition
of
famous
gems
so
she
won
t
give
you
any
money
for
ambulances
it
s
known
she
subscribed
largely
to
the
german
red
cross
before
we
got
into
the
war
leopards
don
t
change
their
spots
easily
as
you
know
it
was
one
of
her
chauffeurs
at
her
country
place
near
roslyn
who
rigged
up
a
wireless
and
didn
t
know
he
was
doing
anything
the
government
disapproved
of
his
mistress
lent
him
the
money
to
equip
the
thing
and
she
didn
t
know
she
ought
not
to
have
done
it
i
tell
you
i
felt
like
pulling
that
necklace
off
her
fat
old
neck
wouldn
t
you
feel
that
way
it
might
make
me
trent
admitted
a
little
on
the
whole
trent
enjoyed
his
first
evening
of
emancipation
immensely
particularly
glad
was
he
to
meet
his
old
friend
alan
kent
again
the
repressed
life
he
had
led
made
him
more
than
ever
susceptible
to
the
hearty
friendship
of
such
men
as
he
had
met
with
some
of
them
he
made
arrangements
to
go
to
a
costume
dance
a
greenwich
village
festival
at
webster
hall
on
the
following
evening
he
did
not
know
that
captain
kent
was
attending
less
as
one
who
would
enjoy
the
function
socially
than
an
emissary
of
his
government
it
was
known
that
many
of
the
villagers
had
not
registered
some
had
spoken
openly
against
the
draft
and
others
were
suspected
of
tendencies
that
might
be
dangerous
it
was
not
a
commission
kent
cared
about
but
it
was
a
time
in
the
national
history
where
old
friendships
must
count
for
naught
treason
must
be
stamped
out
it
was
not
until
midnight
that
trent
dropped
into
webster
hall
it
was
the
nearest
approach
to
the
boulevard
dances
that
new
york
ever
saw
the
costumes
were
gorgeous
some
of
them
but
for
the
greater
part
quaint
and
bizarre
as
a
pierrot
he
was
inconspicuous
there
were
a
number
of
men
he
knew
from
the
scribblers
club
he
greeted
lincoln
with
enthusiasm
he
liked
the
lad
he
envied
him
his
record
it
was
while
he
was
talking
to
him
that
a
gorgeously
dressed
woman
seized
lincoln
s
hands
as
one
might
grasp
those
of
an
old
and
dear
friend
naughty
boy
she
said
playfully
why
haven
t
you
asked
me
to
dance
i
feared
i
wasn
t
good
enough
for
you
lincoln
lied
with
affable
readiness
you
dance
like
a
while
this
badinage
went
on
trent
gazed
at
the
woman
with
idle
curiosity
her
enameled
face
penciled
eyebrows
and
generally
careful
made
her
look
no
more
than
her
hair
was
with
purple
depths
in
it
she
was
too
heavy
for
her
height
and
her
eyes
were
bright
with
the
light
that
comes
in
cocktail
glasses
she
had
reached
the
coquettish
slightly
amorous
stage
her
bold
eyes
soon
fell
on
anthony
trent
who
was
a
far
more
personable
man
than
lincoln
who
is
your
friend
she
demanded
lincoln
was
bound
to
make
the
introduction
from
his
manner
trent
imagined
he
was
not
overpleased
at
having
to
do
so
mr
anthony
trent
the
baroness
von
eckstein
he
said
the
baroness
instantly
put
her
bejeweled
hand
within
trent
s
arm
i
am
sure
you
dance
divinely
she
cooed
lincoln
was
a
little
disappointed
at
the
readiness
with
which
the
older
man
answered
if
you
will
dance
with
me
i
shall
be
inspired
said
trent
very
banal
lincoln
muttered
as
the
two
floated
away
from
him
i
m
so
glad
to
be
rescued
from
lincoln
he
told
her
he
is
so
earnest
and
seems
to
think
i
have
an
ambulance
in
every
pocket
for
this
begging
begging
begging
is
very
tiresome
the
baroness
admitted
she
wished
she
might
say
exactly
what
she
and
her
noble
husband
felt
concerning
it
she
had
understood
that
some
of
these
artists
and
writers
in
the
village
were
exceedingly
liberal
in
their
views
mrs
adrien
beekman
has
been
bothering
me
about
giving
ambulances
all
this
she
is
most
patriotic
he
smiled
but
boring
all
the
i
suppose
you
are
one
of
these
delightfully
bad
young
men
who
say
and
do
dreadful
things
she
hazarded
a
little
later
i
am
both
delightful
and
bad
he
admitted
and
a
number
of
the
things
i
have
done
and
shall
do
are
i
am
afraid
of
you
she
cried
coquettishly
there
was
about
her
throat
a
magnificent
necklace
evidently
that
of
which
lincoln
had
spoken
at
the
scribblers
dinner
it
was
worth
perhaps
half
of
what
the
ambulance
man
had
said
the
stones
were
set
in
platinum
i
wonder
you
are
not
afraid
of
wearing
such
a
magnificent
necklace
here
he
said
later
are
you
so
dangerous
as
that
she
retorted
worse
he
answered
she
looked
at
him
curiously
the
baroness
liked
young
and
men
trent
knew
perfectly
well
what
was
going
on
in
her
mind
he
had
met
women
of
this
type
before
women
who
could
buy
what
they
wanted
and
need
not
haggle
at
the
price
her
eyes
appraised
him
and
she
was
satisfied
with
what
she
saw
i
believe
you
are
just
as
bad
as
you
pretend
to
be
she
declared
do
i
disappoint
you
he
demanded
of
course
she
laughed
i
shall
have
to
reform
you
i
am
very
good
at
reforming
fascinating
like
you
you
must
come
and
have
tea
with
me
one
what
afternoon
he
asked
she
said
at
if
she
had
guessed
with
what
repulsion
she
had
inspired
trent
she
would
have
been
startled
she
was
a
type
he
detested
later
he
said
isn
t
it
unwise
of
you
to
wear
such
a
gorgeous
necklace
at
a
mixed
gathering
like
this
if
it
were
real
it
would
be
she
answered
don
t
tell
any
one
she
commanded
but
this
is
only
an
imitation
the
real
one
is
on
my
dressing
table
this
was
made
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
for
me
and
only
an
expert
could
tell
the
difference
and
then
he
d
have
to
know
his
what
are
you
frowning
at
he
demanded
when
he
saw
her
gaze
directed
toward
a
rather
noisy
group
of
newcomers
these
are
my
guests
she
whispered
i
d
forgotten
all
about
them
doesn
t
that
make
you
vain
i
shall
have
to
look
after
them
later
on
they
are
all
coming
over
to
the
house
to
have
a
bite
to
she
squeezed
his
hand
you
d
better
come
the
baroness
was
not
usually
so
reckless
in
her
invitations
she
had
learned
it
was
not
being
done
in
those
circles
to
which
she
aspired
but
she
was
unusually
merry
and
there
was
something
about
trent
s
keen
type
which
appealed
to
her
lincoln
she
reflected
came
of
a
good
boston
family
with
houses
in
beacon
street
and
pride
s
crossing
and
his
friend
be
all
right
no
sooner
had
she
moved
toward
her
guests
than
trent
made
his
way
to
the
street
over
his
costume
he
wore
a
long
black
cloak
which
another
than
he
had
hired
very
few
people
were
abroad
there
was
a
slight
fog
and
those
who
saw
him
were
in
no
way
amazed
webster
hall
dances
had
prepared
the
neighborhood
for
anything
he
was
not
long
in
coming
to
washington
square
it
was
in
the
block
of
houses
on
the
north
side
that
he
was
specially
interested
from
the
other
side
of
the
road
he
gazed
up
at
the
burton
trent
house
then
going
east
a
little
he
came
to
the
door
of
the
only
apartment
house
in
the
block
it
was
not
difficult
for
him
to
manipulate
the
lock
quietly
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
house
until
he
came
to
a
ladder
leading
to
the
door
on
the
roof
a
few
feet
below
him
he
could
see
the
roof
of
the
neighboring
house
to
this
he
dropped
silently
and
walked
along
until
the
square
skylight
of
the
burton
trent
mansion
was
at
hand
the
bars
that
held
the
aperture
were
rusted
it
required
merely
the
exercise
of
strength
to
pry
one
of
them
loose
underneath
him
was
darkness
since
trent
had
not
come
out
originally
on
professional
business
he
was
without
an
electric
torch
he
had
no
idea
how
far
the
drop
would
be
very
carefully
he
crawled
in
and
hanging
by
one
hand
struck
a
match
he
dropped
on
to
the
floor
of
an
attic
used
mainly
for
the
storage
of
trunks
the
door
leading
from
the
room
was
unlocked
and
he
stepped
out
into
a
dark
corridor
looking
over
the
balustrade
he
could
see
that
the
floor
below
was
brilliantly
lighted
from
an
article
in
a
magazine
devoted
to
interior
decoration
he
had
learned
the
complete
of
the
residence
he
knew
for
example
that
the
servants
slept
in
the
el
of
the
house
which
abutted
on
the
mews
behind
ordinarily
he
would
have
expected
them
to
be
in
bed
by
this
time
but
the
baroness
had
told
him
she
had
guests
coming
in
there
would
inevitably
be
some
servants
making
preparations
they
would
hardly
have
business
on
the
second
or
third
floors
of
the
house
the
burton
trents
who
had
let
their
superb
home
as
a
measure
would
never
allow
any
alteration
of
the
arrangement
of
their
wonderful
furniture
and
the
baroness
would
hardly
be
likely
to
venture
to
set
her
taste
against
that
of
a
family
she
admired
and
indeed
envied
it
was
therefore
probable
that
the
baroness
occupied
the
splendid
sleeping
chamber
on
the
second
floor
front
an
apartment
to
which
the
writer
on
interior
decoration
had
devoted
several
pages
his
borrowed
cloak
enveloping
him
he
descended
the
broad
stairs
until
he
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
room
he
sought
it
was
indeed
a
magnificent
place
his
artistic
sense
delighted
in
it
its
furniture
had
once
been
in
the
sleeping
room
of
a
venetian
doge
it
had
cost
a
fortune
to
buy
the
dressing
room
leading
from
it
was
lighted
more
brilliantly
there
was
a
danger
that
the
baroness
s
maid
might
be
there
awaiting
the
return
of
her
mistress
peeping
through
the
door
he
satisfied
himself
that
no
maid
was
there
on
the
superb
dressing
table
with
its
rich
ornaments
he
could
see
a
large
gold
casket
which
probably
hid
the
stones
he
had
come
to
get
swiftly
he
crossed
the
soft
aubusson
carpet
and
came
to
the
table
he
was
far
too
cautious
to
lay
hands
on
the
metal
box
straightaway
although
he
was
nameless
and
numberless
so
far
as
the
police
were
concerned
he
was
not
anxious
to
leave
behind
he
knew
that
in
all
robberies
such
as
he
intended
the
police
carefully
preserve
the
amongst
the
records
of
the
case
and
hope
eventually
to
saddle
the
criminal
with
indisputable
evidence
of
his
theft
usually
parker
wore
the
white
kid
gloves
that
go
with
full
evening
dress
he
was
without
them
he
was
also
in
the
habit
of
carrying
a
tube
of
collodion
to
coat
the
and
defy
the
this
too
he
was
without
since
his
adventure
was
an
unpremeditated
one
while
he
was
wondering
how
to
set
about
his
business
he
was
startled
by
a
sound
behind
him
from
the
cover
of
a
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
a
small
thin
man
raised
himself
trent
knew
in
a
moment
it
was
the
baron
von
eckstein
he
relaxed
his
tense
attitude
and
walked
with
a
friendly
smile
to
the
other
man
he
had
mentally
rehearsed
the
rôle
he
was
to
play
but
the
baron
surprised
him
hip
hip
ooray
hiccoughed
the
aristocrat
there
was
not
a
doubt
as
to
his
condition
he
swayed
as
he
tried
to
sit
up
straighter
his
eyes
were
glazed
with
drink
chapter
xv
the
baron
lends
a
hand
hip
hip
ooray
said
the
baron
again
and
sank
back
into
bibulous
slumber
by
his
side
on
a
tray
was
a
bottle
of
liqueur
cognac
and
an
open
bottle
of
champagne
he
had
evidently
been
consuming
champagne
and
brandy
highballs
anthony
trent
considered
him
for
a
few
moments
in
silence
he
saw
a
way
out
of
his
difficulties
and
a
certain
ironical
method
of
fooling
investigation
which
pleased
him
more
than
a
little
in
a
tall
tumbler
he
mixed
brandy
and
champagne
half
and
half
and
poked
the
little
baron
in
the
ribs
the
familiar
sight
of
being
offered
his
favorite
tipple
made
the
trembling
hand
seize
the
glass
the
contents
was
absorbed
greedily
and
the
baron
fell
back
on
the
the
phrase
dead
to
the
world
alone
describes
the
condition
of
the
baron
who
had
married
a
brewery
trent
raised
the
man
he
could
have
weighed
no
more
than
a
hundred
pounds
in
his
strong
arms
and
carried
him
across
to
the
dressing
table
and
with
the
baron
s
limp
hands
he
opened
the
jewel
case
therefrom
he
extracted
a
necklace
of
diamonds
set
in
platinum
what
else
was
there
he
did
not
touch
he
had
a
definitely
planned
course
of
action
in
view
the
baron
s
recording
fingers
closed
the
box
it
would
be
as
pretty
a
case
of
as
ever
gladdened
the
heart
of
a
detective
the
baron
was
next
carried
to
the
he
would
not
wake
for
several
hours
it
would
have
been
quite
easy
for
trent
to
make
his
escape
undetected
but
there
was
something
else
to
be
done
first
he
locked
the
door
of
the
venetian
bedroom
and
then
took
up
the
telephone
receiver
his
carefully
trained
memory
recorded
the
accent
and
voice
of
the
baron
von
eckstein
as
he
had
heard
it
during
an
evening
at
the
theater
he
called
a
telephone
number
fortunately
it
was
a
private
wire
connecting
with
the
central
i
wish
to
speak
to
adrien
beekman
he
said
when
at
length
there
was
an
answer
to
his
call
she
is
in
bed
a
sleepy
voice
returned
she
can
t
be
she
must
be
said
trent
mimicking
the
baron
it
is
a
matter
of
vast
importance
tell
her
a
gentleman
wishes
to
present
her
ambulance
fund
with
a
large
sum
of
money
will
be
too
i
ll
see
what
can
be
done
said
the
voice
that
s
about
the
only
matter
i
dare
disturb
her
on
hold
the
madam
said
trent
a
minute
later
it
is
the
baron
von
eckstein
who
has
the
honor
to
speak
with
an
odd
hour
to
choose
returned
adrien
beekman
with
no
cordiality
i
wish
to
make
reparation
madam
the
pseudo
baron
flung
back
this
afternoon
you
talked
to
my
wife
the
baroness
about
your
and
found
her
not
interested
in
the
least
beekman
said
a
little
crossly
so
eminent
a
leader
of
society
as
she
was
not
accustomed
to
refusal
of
a
donation
when
asked
of
rich
women
striving
for
social
recognition
we
have
decided
that
your
cause
is
one
which
should
have
met
a
more
generous
response
i
have
been
accused
of
being
disloyal
that
is
false
madam
my
wife
has
been
attacked
as
that
is
also
false
to
prove
our
loyalty
we
have
decided
to
send
you
a
diamond
necklace
convert
this
into
money
and
buy
what
ambulances
you
do
you
mean
this
said
the
astonished
adrien
beekman
i
am
never
more
serious
retorted
the
baron
what
value
has
it
she
asked
next
you
will
get
fifty
thousand
dollars
at
least
he
said
ten
ambulances
she
cried
oh
baron
how
very
generous
i
m
afraid
i
ve
cherished
hard
feelings
about
you
both
that
have
not
been
justified
how
perfectly
splendid
of
you
one
other
thing
said
the
baron
i
am
sending
this
by
a
trusted
messenger
at
once
please
see
that
some
one
reliable
is
there
to
receive
it
was
safer
trent
thought
to
gain
the
square
over
the
roofs
and
down
the
stairways
of
the
apartment
house
it
was
now
raining
and
hardly
a
soul
was
in
view
the
adrien
beekman
house
was
only
a
block
distant
they
were
of
the
few
who
retained
family
mansions
on
the
lower
end
of
fifth
avenue
he
knocked
at
the
beekman
door
and
a
opened
it
in
the
shadows
the
man
could
only
see
the
dark
outline
of
the
messenger
i
am
the
baron
von
eckstein
he
said
still
with
his
carefully
mimicked
accent
this
is
the
package
of
which
i
spoke
to
your
it
seemed
when
he
got
back
to
webster
hall
that
none
had
missed
him
the
first
to
speak
was
the
baroness
we
are
just
going
over
to
the
house
she
said
cordially
i
don
t
want
to
share
you
he
said
smiling
with
all
these
others
i
d
rather
come
at
four
may
i
at
four
on
the
next
day
anthony
trent
dressed
in
the
best
of
taste
as
a
man
of
fashion
and
leisure
ascended
the
steps
to
the
burton
trent
home
and
wondered
as
others
had
done
before
him
at
the
amazing
fowl
which
guarded
its
approach
he
was
kept
waiting
several
minutes
from
the
distant
reception
rooms
he
heard
acrimonious
voices
one
was
the
baron
s
and
it
pleased
him
to
note
that
he
had
caught
its
inflections
so
well
the
night
before
the
other
voice
was
that
of
his
new
friend
the
baroness
unfortunately
the
conversation
was
in
german
and
its
meaning
incomprehensible
when
at
last
he
was
shown
into
a
drawing
room
he
found
the
baroness
highly
excited
and
not
a
little
indignant
she
was
too
much
overwrought
to
take
much
interest
in
her
new
acquaintance
almost
she
looked
as
though
she
wished
he
had
not
come
things
rarely
looked
so
rosy
to
the
baroness
as
they
did
after
a
good
dinner
and
it
was
but
four
o
clock
what
has
disturbed
you
he
asked
everything
she
retorted
mainly
my
husband
tell
me
if
you
were
a
woman
and
your
husband
in
a
drunken
fit
gave
away
a
diamond
necklace
to
an
enemy
would
you
be
calm
about
it
has
that
happened
he
demanded
it
has
she
snapped
you
remember
i
told
you
at
the
dance
i
had
left
the
original
necklace
at
home
for
safety
i
believe
you
did
mention
it
he
said
meditating
i
d
much
better
have
worn
it
trent
everybody
knows
the
baron
s
passion
is
for
cognac
and
champagne
no
man
since
time
began
has
ever
drunk
so
much
of
them
when
we
got
back
here
last
night
we
had
a
gay
and
festive
time
it
was
almost
light
when
i
went
to
my
room
and
found
the
necklace
gone
i
sobered
the
baron
and
he
could
give
absolutely
no
explanation
he
said
he
had
slept
in
the
dressing
room
to
guard
the
jewels
that
was
nonsense
he
came
there
to
worry
my
maid
she
went
to
bed
and
left
him
drinking
the
police
came
in
and
took
all
the
servants
and
tried
to
fasten
the
thing
on
them
there
were
marks
on
the
jewel
case
where
some
one
s
hands
had
been
put
i
offered
a
reward
of
five
thousand
dollars
for
any
one
who
could
point
out
the
man
or
woman
who
had
taken
the
trent
kept
his
countenance
to
the
proper
pitch
of
interest
and
sympathy
it
was
not
easy
what
have
the
police
found
wait
the
baroness
commanded
you
shall
hear
everything
this
morning
i
received
a
letter
from
adrien
beekman
you
know
who
she
is
of
course
she
thanked
me
rather
patronizingly
for
giving
my
diamond
necklace
to
her
ambulance
fund
she
said
she
had
sold
it
to
a
mexican
millionaire
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
enough
to
buy
ten
how
did
she
get
the
necklace
trent
asked
seriously
that
husband
of
mine
she
returned
the
baron
did
it
i
can
only
think
that
in
his
maudlin
condition
he
remembered
what
i
had
told
him
at
dinner
about
being
bothered
by
the
beekman
woman
for
a
cause
i
m
not
very
much
in
sympathy
with
there
is
no
other
explanation
it
all
fits
in
actually
he
took
the
diamonds
to
the
beekman
place
himself
i
can
t
do
anything
i
dare
not
tell
the
facts
or
i
should
be
laughed
out
of
new
mrs
adrien
beekman
is
very
influential
he
reminded
her
choking
back
his
glee
it
may
prove
worth
your
she
hates
me
the
baroness
said
vindictively
i
ve
never
been
so
upset
in
my
life
you
haven
t
heard
all
there
s
worse
one
of
my
servants
is
trying
to
get
into
the
army
and
navy
bureau
she
s
made
of
every
one
in
the
house
me
included
from
glasses
or
anything
we
ve
touched
it
was
the
baron
s
on
the
jewel
case
as
the
police
found
out
too
and
i
ve
got
to
pay
her
five
thousand
dollars

chapter
xvi
the
mount
aubyn
ruby
it
was
while
trent
was
shaving
that
the
lamp
fell
he
started
blessed
the
man
who
invented
safety
razors
that
he
had
not
gashed
himself
and
went
into
his
library
to
see
what
had
happened
kinney
his
housekeeper
was
volubly
apologetic
i
was
only
dusting
it
she
explained
when
it
came
down
i
think
it
s
no
more
than
it
was
a
hanging
lamp
of
benares
brasswork
not
of
much
value
but
trent
liked
its
quaint
design
and
the
brilliant
flashing
of
the
cut
colored
glass
that
embellished
it
four
eyes
of
light
looked
out
on
the
world
when
the
lamp
was
lit
white
green
blue
and
red
eyes
of
the
size
of
filbert
nuts
he
stooped
down
and
picked
up
the
shattered
red
glass
it
was
the
sole
damage
done
by
kinney
s
activity
it
will
cost
only
a
few
cents
to
have
it
repaired
he
commented
and
went
back
to
the
bathroom
and
speedily
forgot
the
whole
matter
at
breakfast
anthony
trent
admitted
he
was
bored
there
had
been
little
excitement
in
his
recent
work
the
niceness
of
calculation
the
careful
planning
and
dextrous
carrying
out
of
his
affairs
had
netted
him
a
great
deal
of
money
with
very
little
risk
there
had
been
risk
often
enough
but
not
within
the
past
few
months
his
thoughts
went
back
to
some
of
his
more
noteworthy
feats
and
he
smiled
he
chuckled
at
the
episode
of
the
bank
president
whom
he
had
given
in
charge
for
picking
his
pocket
when
he
had
just
relieved
the
financier
of
the
choicest
contents
of
his
safe
trent
s
specialty
was
adroit
handling
of
situations
which
would
have
been
too
much
for
the
ordinary
criminal
he
had
an
aplomb
an
ingenuous
air
and
was
so
diametrically
opposed
to
the
common
conception
of
a
burglar
that
people
had
often
apologized
to
him
whose
homes
he
had
looted
it
was
his
custom
to
read
through
two
of
the
leading
morning
papers
after
breakfast
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
keep
himself
fully
informed
of
the
movements
of
society
of
engagements
divorces
and
marriages
it
was
usually
among
people
of
this
sort
that
he
operated
to
the
columns
devoted
to
lost
articles
he
gave
special
attention
more
than
once
he
had
seen
big
rewards
offered
for
things
that
he
had
concealed
in
his
rooms
and
although
the
comforting
phrase
no
questions
asked
invariably
accompanied
the
advertisement
he
never
made
application
for
the
reward
in
this
trent
differed
from
the
usual
practitioner
of
crime
when
he
had
abandoned
fiction
for
a
more
diverting
sport
he
had
formulated
regulations
for
his
professional
conduct
drawn
up
with
extraordinary
care
it
was
the
first
article
of
his
faith
under
no
circumstances
to
go
to
a
fence
or
disposer
of
stolen
goods
or
to
visit
pawnshops
it
is
plain
to
see
such
precautions
were
wise
sooner
or
later
the
police
get
the
fence
and
with
him
the
man
s
clientèle
every
man
who
sells
to
a
fence
puts
his
safety
in
another
s
keeping
and
anthony
trent
was
minded
to
play
the
game
alone
as
to
the
pawnshops
daily
the
police
regulations
expose
more
searchingly
the
practices
of
those
who
bear
the
arms
of
old
lombardy
above
their
doors
the
court
news
is
full
of
convictions
obtained
by
the
police
detailed
to
watch
the
pawnbrokers
customers
it
was
largely
on
this
account
that
trent
specialized
on
currency
and
remained
unknown
to
the
authorities
on
this
particular
morning
the
newspapers
offered
nothing
of
interest
except
to
say
that
a
certain
italian
duke
whose
cousin
had
recently
become
engaged
to
an
american
girl
of
wealth
and
position
was
about
to
cross
the
ocean
and
bear
with
him
family
jewels
as
a
wedding
gift
from
the
great
house
he
represented
methodically
trent
made
a
note
of
this
later
he
took
the
subway
downtown
to
consult
with
his
brokers
on
the
purchase
of
certain
oil
stocks
he
had
hardly
taken
his
seat
when
horace
weems
pounced
upon
him
this
weems
was
an
energetic
creature
by
instinct
and
training
a
salesman
so
proud
of
his
art
and
so
certain
of
himself
that
he
was
wont
to
boast
he
could
sell
hot
tamales
in
hell
by
shrewdness
he
had
amassed
a
comfortable
fortune
he
was
a
short
blond
man
nearly
always
capable
of
profuse
perspirations
trent
knew
by
weems
excitement
that
there
was
at
hand
either
an
entrancingly
beautiful
girl
as
weems
saw
beauty
or
a
very
rich
man
only
these
two
spectacles
were
capable
of
bringing
weems
smooth
cheeks
to
this
flush
of
excitement
weems
sometimes
described
himself
as
a
you
see
that
man
coming
toward
us
weems
whispered
trent
looked
up
there
were
three
men
advancing
one
was
a
heavily
built
man
of
late
middle
age
with
a
disagreeable
face
dominant
chin
and
hard
gray
eyes
the
other
two
were
younger
and
had
that
alert
bearing
which
men
gain
whose
work
requires
a
sound
body
and
courage
are
they
arresting
him
parker
demanded
he
noticed
that
they
were
very
close
to
the
elder
man
they
might
be
central
office
men
arresting
weems
whispered
still
excitedly
i
should
say
not
you
don
t
know
who
he
i
only
know
that
he
must
be
rich
trent
returned
that
s
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
the
country
weems
told
him
that
s
jerome
your
news
leaves
me
unmoved
said
the
other
i
never
heard
of
he
hates
publicity
weems
informed
him
if
a
paper
prints
a
line
about
him
it
s
his
enemy
and
it
don
t
pay
to
have
the
enmity
of
a
man
worth
nearly
a
hundred
what
s
his
line
trent
demanded
everything
weems
said
enthusiastically
he
owns
half
the
mills
in
new
bedford
for
one
thing
and
then
there
s
real
estate
in
this
village
and
weems
sighed
if
i
had
his
money
i
d
buy
a
paper
and
have
myself
spread
all
over
it
and
he
won
t
have
a
i
m
not
sure
he
has
succeeded
in
keeping
it
out
i
d
swear
that
i
ve
read
something
about
him
it
comes
back
clearly
it
was
something
about
jewels
i
remember
now
it
was
jerome
dangerfield
who
bought
a
famous
ruby
that
the
war
compelled
an
english
marchioness
to
the
thing
was
quite
clear
to
him
now
he
was
on
his
favorite
topic
it
was
known
as
the
mount
aubyn
ruby
after
the
family
which
had
it
so
he
turned
to
look
at
the
financier
so
that
s
the
man
whose
wife
has
that
jewel
what
do
you
mean
blood
stained
weems
demanded
it
s
one
of
the
tragic
stones
of
history
said
the
other
men
have
sold
their
lives
for
it
and
women
their
honor
one
of
the
former
marquises
of
mount
aubyn
killed
his
best
friend
in
a
duel
for
it
god
knows
what
blood
was
spilled
for
it
in
india
before
it
went
to
you
don
t
believe
all
that
junk
do
you
asked
weems
junk
the
other
flung
back
at
him
have
you
ever
looked
at
a
ruby
sure
i
have
weems
returned
aggrieved
haven
t
you
seen
my
ruby
stick
pin
which
represents
to
you
only
so
many
dollars
and
is
after
all
only
a
small
stone
if
you
d
ever
looked
into
the
heart
of
a
ruby
you
d
know
what
i
mean
there
s
a
million
little
lurking
devils
in
it
weems
taunting
you
mocking
you
making
you
covet
it
and
ready
to
do
murder
to
have
it
for
your
weems
looked
at
him
startled
for
the
moment
he
had
never
known
his
friend
so
intense
so
unlike
his
careless
debonair
self
for
the
moment
said
weems
i
thought
you
meant
it
of
course
you
used
to
write
fiction
and
that
explains
to
his
articles
of
faith
anthony
trent
added
another
paragraph
he
swore
not
to
let
his
enthusiasm
run
away
with
him
when
he
discussed
jewels
weems
was
safe
enough
he
was
lucky
to
be
in
no
other
company
but
suppose
he
had
babbled
to
one
of
those
men
engaged
in
guarding
jerome
dangerfield
the
who
shunned
publicity
he
determined
to
choose
another
subject
what
does
he
take
those
men
around
with
him
for
he
asked
a
very
rich
man
is
pestered
to
death
the
wise
weems
said
cranks
try
to
interest
him
in
all
sorts
of
fool
schemes
and
crazy
men
try
to
kill
him
for
being
a
capitalist
and
then
there
s
beggars
and
charities
and
blackmailers
nobody
can
get
next
to
him
i
know
i
ve
tried
i
ve
never
seen
him
in
the
subway
before
i
guess
his
car
broke
down
and
he
had
to
come
with
the
so
you
tried
what
was
your
scheme
i
forget
now
weems
admitted
i
ve
had
so
many
good
things
since
i
followed
out
a
stunt
of
that
crook
conway
parker
you
used
to
write
about
in
one
of
your
stories
you
made
him
want
to
meet
a
millionaire
and
instead
of
going
to
his
office
you
made
him
go
to
the
fifth
avenue
home
and
fool
the
butlers
and
flunkeys
it
won
t
work
old
man
i
know
i
handed
the
head
butler
my
hat
and
cane
but
that
was
as
far
as
i
got
there
must
be
a
high
sign
in
that
sort
of
a
house
that
i
wasn
t
wise
weems
mused
on
his
defeat
for
a
few
seconds
i
ought
to
have
worn
a
he
brightened
anyway
just
as
i
came
out
of
the
door
a
lady
friend
passed
by
on
the
top
of
a
bus
and
saw
me
now
you
re
a
good
looker
old
man
and
and
all
that
but
you
and
i
don
t
belong
in
places
like
millionaires
too
bad
said
trent
smiling
he
wondered
what
weems
would
have
said
if
he
had
known
that
his
friend
had
within
the
week
been
to
a
reception
in
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
fifth
avenue
palaces
and
there
gazed
at
a
splendid
ruby
not
half
the
size
of
the
mount
aubyn
stone
on
the
yellowing
neck
of
an
aged
lady
of
many
loves
when
weems
was
shaken
off
dangerfield
and
his
attendants
vanished
and
trent
had
placed
an
order
with
his
brokers
he
walked
over
to
park
row
where
he
had
once
worked
as
a
cub
reporter
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
he
entered
a
saloon
well
patronized
by
the
older
order
of
newspapermen
men
who
graduated
in
a
day
when
it
was
possible
to
drink
hard
and
hold
a
responsible
position
he
had
barely
crossed
the
threshold
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
man
he
sought
it
was
clarke
slave
to
the
archdemon
rum
he
was
trying
to
borrow
enough
money
from
a
monotype
man
who
had
admitted
backing
a
winner
to
get
a
prescription
filled
for
a
suffering
wife
the
monotype
man
either
disbelieving
clarke
s
story
or
having
little
regard
for
wifely
suffering
was
indisposed
to
share
his
winnings
with
druggist
or
bartender
it
was
at
this
moment
that
clarke
caught
sight
of
his
old
reporter
and
more
recent
benefactor
he
dropped
the
monotype
man
with
all
the
outraged
pride
of
an
erstwhile
city
editor
and
shook
trent
s
hand
cordially
his
own
trembled
that
might
be
managed
said
trent
listening
to
his
request
gravely
but
first
have
a
drink
to
steady
your
they
repaired
to
a
little
alcove
and
sat
down
clarke
was
not
anxious
to
leave
so
pleasant
a
spot
he
talked
entertainingly
and
was
ready
to
expatiate
on
his
former
glories
by
the
way
said
trent
presently
you
used
to
know
the
inside
history
and
hidden
secrets
of
every
big
man
in
i
do
yet
clarke
insisted
eagerly
what
s
on
your
mind
nothing
in
particular
said
the
other
idly
but
i
came
downtown
on
the
subway
and
saw
jerome
dangerfield
with
his
two
men
what
s
he
afraid
of
and
why
won
t
he
have
publicity
that
swinehound
clarke
exclaimed
why
wouldn
t
he
be
afraid
of
publicity
with
his
record
you
re
too
young
to
remember
but
i
what
do
you
know
trent
demanded
i
know
that
he
s
worse
than
the
said
he
was
when
i
was
on
the
staff
twenty
years
back
that
was
why
the
old
went
out
of
business
he
put
it
out
a
paper
is
a
business
institution
and
won
t
antagonize
a
vicious
fighter
like
dangerfield
unless
it
s
necessary
that
s
why
they
leave
him
alone
the
big
political
parties
get
campaign
contributions
from
him
why
stir
him
up
but
you
haven
t
told
me
what
he
did
women
said
clarke
briefly
you
know
boy
that
some
men
are
born
that
may
be
natural
enough
but
if
it
s
a
game
play
it
fair
pay
for
your
folly
he
didn
t
you
ask
me
why
he
has
those
guards
with
him
it
s
to
protect
him
from
the
fathers
of
young
girls
who
ve
sworn
to
get
him
his
bosom
pal
got
his
at
a
roof
garden
a
dozen
years
back
and
dangerfield
s
watching
night
and
day
he
s
bad
all
through
the
stuff
we
had
on
him
at
the
would
make
you
think
you
were
back
in
decadent
what
s
his
wife
like
society
all
society
handsome
they
tell
me
and
not
any
too
much
brain
but
domineering
full
of
precious
stones
i
m
told
every
servant
is
a
detective
i
guess
they
are
as
you
never
heard
of
any
of
their
valuables
being
taken
it
makes
me
thirsty
to
think
of
trent
when
he
had
obtained
the
information
he
desired
left
clarke
with
enough
money
to
buy
medicine
for
his
wife
with
the
bartender
he
left
sufficient
to
pay
for
a
taxi
to
the
of
sauer
where
he
himself
had
once
resided
clarke
would
need
it
on
his
way
uptown
he
found
himself
thinking
continuously
of
jerome
dangerfield
and
the
mount
aubyn
ruby
there
would
be
excitement
in
going
after
such
a
prize
the
dangerfield
household
was
one
into
which
thieves
had
not
been
able
to
break
nor
steal
a
man
to
make
a
successful
coup
would
need
more
than
a
knowledge
of
the
mechanism
of
burglar
alarms
or
safes
he
would
need
steel
nerves
a
clear
head
physical
courage
and
that
intuitive
knowledge
of
how
to
proceed
which
marks
the
great
criminal
from
his
brother
the
ordinary
crook
if
he
possessed
himself
of
the
ruby
there
would
be
no
chance
to
sell
it
it
was
as
well
known
among
connoisseurs
as
are
the
paintings
of
velasquez
to
cut
it
into
lesser
stones
would
be
a
piece
of
vandalism
that
he
could
never
bring
himself
to
enact
it
was
trent
s
custom
when
he
planned
a
job
to
lay
out
in
concise
form
the
possible
and
probable
dangers
he
must
meet
and
to
each
one
of
these
problems
there
must
be
a
solution
he
decided
that
an
entrance
to
the
dangerfield
house
from
the
outside
would
fail
to
gain
a
position
in
the
household
would
be
not
easy
in
all
probability
references
would
be
strictly
looked
up
they
would
be
easy
enough
to
forge
but
if
they
were
exposed
he
would
be
a
suspect
and
his
fictitious
uncle
in
australia
exhumed
also
he
did
not
care
to
live
in
a
household
where
he
was
certain
to
be
under
the
observation
of
detectives
no
less
than
jerome
dangerfield
he
shrank
from
publicity
kinney
noticed
that
he
was
strangely
unresponsive
to
her
lunch
when
she
enquired
the
cause
he
told
her
he
wanted
a
change
i
shall
go
away
and
play
golf
for
a
couple
of
weeks
he
declared
chapter
xvii
trent
takes
a
holiday
at
a
sporting
goods
store
that
afternoon
he
ran
into
jerome
dangerfield
again
he
had
just
bought
a
dozen
balls
when
he
saw
the
millionaire
and
his
two
attendants
he
was
not
minded
to
be
observed
of
them
so
slipped
into
the
little
room
where
putters
may
be
tried
and
drives
be
made
into
nets
from
where
he
was
he
could
hear
dangerfield
s
disagreeable
rasping
voice
his
grievance
it
seemed
was
that
other
golfers
were
able
to
get
better
balls
than
he
he
badgered
the
clerk
until
the
man
found
spirit
to
observe
if
there
was
a
ball
that
would
make
a
dub
play
good
golf
it
would
be
worth
a
fortune
to
any
trent
was
able
to
see
the
look
of
anger
the
capitalist
threw
at
him
and
this
anger
he
saw
reflected
on
the
faces
of
the
two
attendants
decidedly
any
lone
man
pitting
his
courage
and
wit
against
the
dangerfield
entourage
would
need
sympathy
send
me
a
up
to
sunset
park
hotel
he
heard
dangerfield
say
as
he
walked
away
still
frowning
i
hope
you
don
t
have
many
of
that
kind
to
wait
on
trent
said
sympathetically
he
was
always
courteous
to
those
with
whom
he
had
dealings
he
s
the
limit
said
the
clerk
and
from
the
way
he
looked
at
me
i
guess
the
boss
will
hear
of
it
seemed
to
think
there
was
a
ball
that
would
make
him
drive
two
hundred
and
fifty
and
hole
a
putt
and
i
was
trying
to
hide
it
from
him
you
wouldn
t
think
it
but
he
s
one
of
the
richest
men
living
gee
it
makes
me
feel
like
a
socialist
when
i
think
of
it
the
clerk
wondered
why
it
was
a
superb
golfer
as
he
knew
trent
to
be
was
modest
and
courteous
while
a
man
like
dangerfield
was
so
overbearing
before
he
went
home
trent
looked
up
sunset
park
in
a
golfer
s
guide
it
was
a
course
among
the
berkshires
with
only
nine
holes
to
its
credit
the
rates
of
the
hotel
were
sufficiently
high
to
make
it
clear
only
the
rich
could
play
it
was
probably
one
of
these
dreary
courses
where
a
scratch
player
would
be
a
rara
avis
a
course
to
which
elderly
men
playing
for
their
health
gravitated
and
made
the
lives
of
caddies
miserable
it
was
a
curious
thing
trent
thought
that
while
this
morning
he
knew
nothing
of
dangerfield
by
night
he
knew
a
great
deal
an
evening
paper
told
him
why
the
millionaire
was
going
to
the
berkshires
there
was
to
be
a
wedding
in
high
society
and
the
bride
was
a
niece
of
jerome
dangerfield
the
ceremony
would
take
place
at
the
episcopal
church
of
the
good
shepherd
and
a
bishop
would
unite
the
contracting
parties
the
fancy
dress
ball
to
be
held
would
be
the
most
elaborate
ever
held
outside
new
york
a
great
pavilion
was
to
be
erected
for
the
occasion
in
the
grounds
of
the
bride
s
magnificent
home
and
newport
would
be
for
the
moment
deserted
it
was
rumored
that
the
jewels
to
be
worn
would
exceed
in
value
anything
that
had
ever
been
gathered
together
this
side
the
atlantic
and
so
on
two
columns
long
it
explained
very
clearly
why
the
jerome
dangerfields
were
going
to
sunset
park
the
collective
value
of
the
jewels
appealed
particularly
to
trent
he
wondered
if
the
mount
aubyn
ruby
would
shine
out
on
that
festal
night
and
if
so
how
would
it
be
guarded
it
would
be
less
difficult
to
disguise
the
detectives
in
fancy
costume
than
in
evening
dress
of
course
the
owner
of
such
a
gem
might
wear
an
imitation
as
the
baroness
von
eckstein
had
done
but
if
clarke
had
painted
her
aright
this
was
an
occasion
when
an
ambitious
woman
would
be
willing
to
take
risks
the
proprietors
of
the
sunset
park
hotel
were
glad
to
accommodate
anthony
trent
with
a
bed
and
bathroom
for
a
little
over
a
hundred
dollars
a
week
it
was
a
very
select
resort
they
explained
attracting
such
people
as
the
jerome
dangerfields
and
their
friends
the
golf
course
was
owned
by
the
hotel
and
the
first
tee
was
on
the
lawn
a
few
yards
from
the
front
piazza
on
the
morning
following
his
arrival
trent
golf
clubs
already
allotted
to
a
caddy
waited
to
see
what
kind
of
golf
was
played
they
were
indifferently
good
but
he
betrayed
little
attention
until
he
saw
dangerfield
coming
immediately
he
went
to
the
tee
but
did
not
make
his
first
shot
until
the
millionaire
was
near
enough
to
see
playing
alone
as
was
the
capitalist
for
few
were
yet
on
the
links
he
had
not
to
wait
as
he
must
have
done
had
the
other
been
playing
with
a
partner
the
first
green
was
distant
one
hundred
and
sixty
yards
from
the
tee
a
brook
with
sedgy
reeds
was
a
fine
natural
hazard
and
as
the
green
was
on
an
elevated
plateau
with
deep
grass
beyond
it
was
not
an
easy
one
to
reach
dangerfield
dreaded
it
dangerfield
saw
a
tall
slim
young
man
correctly
clad
in
breeches
and
stockings
using
a
mashie
drop
his
ball
neatly
on
the
green
within
putting
distance
of
the
hole
later
he
saw
the
hole
done
in
two
which
was
one
under
par
who
is
that
man
dangerfield
demanded
of
his
caddie
never
seen
him
before
the
lad
answered
dangerfield
took
his
brassey
and
went
straightway
into
the
brook
he
saw
however
as
he
was
ball
hunting
this
stranger
make
a
wonderful
drive
to
the
second
two
hundred
and
fifty
yards
the
enthusiastic
caddie
swore
meanwhile
the
millionaire
continued
to
press
and
slice
and
pull
and
top
his
ball
to
such
effect
as
to
do
the
double
round
in
one
hundred
and
nothing
exasperated
him
so
much
as
to
find
the
game
mock
his
strength
and
desire
a
power
wherever
money
marts
were
he
was
here
openly
laughed
at
by
caddies
he
was
discovering
that
rank
on
the
links
is
determined
by
skill
at
the
game
alone
what
mattered
it
that
he
was
the
great
jerome
dangerfield
what
had
he
done
the
round
in
what
was
his
handicap
he
particularly
wanted
to
humble
stephen
goswell
president
of
the
first
agricultural
bank
of
new
york
city
goswell
was
a
year
ahead
of
him
at
the
game
and
had
the
edge
on
him
so
far
goswell
could
manage
short
approaches
occasionally
strokes
that
were
beyond
his
own
inflexible
wrists
now
this
tall
dark
stranger
had
such
strokes
to
perfection
the
ball
driven
up
into
the
air
skimmed
tree
wall
or
bunker
and
rolled
up
to
the
pin
sweetly
dangerfield
quickly
made
up
his
mind
he
would
invite
the
stranger
to
play
with
him
and
then
get
hints
which
would
improve
his
game
fifty
per
cent
morning
he
said
later
at
the
nineteenth
hole
where
the
stranger
was
taking
a
drink
good
morning
said
the
stranger
rather
stiffly
it
is
evident
thought
dangerfield
he
does
not
know
who
i
going
round
again
after
lunch
dangerfield
demanded
i
think
so
the
stranger
responded
we
might
play
together
said
dangerfield
i
haven
t
a
i
m
afraid
that
won
t
make
a
good
match
trent
told
him
surely
there
is
some
one
more
your
strength
who
would
make
a
better
match
of
it
huh
grunted
the
other
think
i
don
t
play
well
enough
eh
i
know
it
said
trent
composedly
dangerfield
regarded
him
sourly
you
re
not
overburdened
with
modesty
young
i
hope
not
the
other
retorted
nothing
handicaps
a
man
more
in
life
i
happen
to
know
golf
though
and
my
experience
is
that
if
i
play
with
a
much
inferior
player
i
get
careless
and
that
s
bad
for
my
game
i
m
perfectly
frank
about
it
you
know
next
to
nothing
about
the
game
in
your
own
line
of
work
you
could
no
doubt
give
me
a
big
beating
because
you
know
it
and
i
don
and
what
do
you
suppose
my
line
of
work
is
snapped
the
annoyed
i
don
t
know
trent
commented
either
a
dentist
or
a
theatrical
as
he
spoke
up
sauntered
one
of
the
two
men
with
whom
he
had
seen
dangerfield
in
the
subway
i
d
like
to
hire
some
one
to
take
the
starch
out
of
you
dangerfield
said
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
quite
easy
trent
returned
almost
any
professional
he
watched
the
two
walk
away
and
chuckled
he
had
attracted
the
millionaire
s
attention
and
he
had
rebuffed
him
so
far
his
programme
was
being
carried
out
on
scheduled
time
the
attendant
had
not
looked
at
him
with
any
special
interest
it
was
unlikely
in
different
clothes
under
other
conditions
and
in
a
strange
place
he
would
recognize
him
he
did
not
play
again
that
day
instead
he
paid
attention
to
some
elderly
ladies
who
knitted
feverishly
and
were
inclined
to
talk
he
learned
a
great
deal
of
useful
news
for
example
that
the
dangerfields
always
had
meals
in
their
big
private
suite
and
rarely
without
guests
from
nearby
homes
that
they
quarreled
constantly
that
dangerfield
never
went
to
bed
wholly
sober
that
he
was
given
to
sudden
gusts
of
temper
and
only
last
year
had
beaten
a
caddie
and
had
been
compelled
to
settle
the
assault
with
a
large
money
payment
that
he
was
not
above
pocketing
a
golf
ball
if
he
could
do
so
without
being
observed
that
he
had
several
times
been
seen
to
lift
his
ball
out
of
an
unfavorable
lie
into
one
from
which
he
could
play
with
greater
chance
of
making
a
good
stroke
these
petty
meannesses
trent
had
already
surmised
dangerfield
seemed
to
him
that
sort
of
a
man
he
was
more
interested
in
the
dinner
parties
but
a
man
in
such
a
position
as
he
was
had
to
be
careful
as
to
what
questions
he
asked
people
had
a
knack
of
remembering
them
at
inopportune
moments
fortunately
one
of
the
ladies
who
was
a
miss
northend
of
lynn
came
back
to
it
she
was
a
furious
knitter
and
knitted
best
when
her
tongue
wagged
of
course
this
hotel
belongs
to
dangerfield
she
babbled
and
that
explains
why
they
have
a
palatial
suite
here
and
can
entertain
even
more
readily
than
if
they
had
a
summer
home
as
their
friends
have
this
is
a
very
fashionable
section
the
women
dress
here
as
if
they
were
in
newport
every
night
dangerfield
goes
down
to
the
hotel
safe
and
brings
something
gorgeous
in
the
jewelry
way
for
his
wife
to
wear
there
s
a
private
stairway
he
uses
i
wandered
into
it
once
by
and
sister
was
so
flustered
the
other
miss
northend
of
lynn
told
him
that
when
he
accused
her
of
spying
on
him
she
couldn
t
say
a
word
it
really
did
look
suspicious
until
he
knew
we
were
northends
and
our
father
was
his
counsel
once
when
he
controlled
the
boston
and
rangely
when
these
estimable
maidens
had
finished
anthony
trent
knew
all
those
particulars
he
desired
it
was
not
the
first
time
amiable
gossips
had
aided
him
but
he
played
his
part
so
well
that
miss
fannie
chided
her
sister
he
wasn
t
a
bit
interested
in
the
dangerfield
wealth
she
said
all
a
young
man
like
that
thinks
of
is
well
said
her
sister
i
am
interested
and
i
m
frightened
too
when
i
think
of
all
that
amount
of
precious
stones
in
the
hotel
safe
i
m
positively
alarmed
every
night
she
wears
something
new
her
maid
told
the
girl
who
looks
after
our
chapter
xviii
the
great
black
bird
there
was
exactly
one
week
to
the
night
of
the
fancy
dress
dance
at
the
uplands
from
the
time
that
the
northend
sisters
gave
the
abstractor
so
much
information
every
moment
of
it
was
carefully
taken
up
by
that
calculating
gentleman
for
example
on
the
following
morning
wednesday
he
played
a
round
with
the
club
s
champion
an
amateur
of
some
skill
dangerfield
posing
for
the
moment
as
a
warm
admirer
of
the
local
player
followed
the
two
on
their
match
betting
freely
on
blackhall
his
clubmate
also
he
violated
every
rule
of
the
royal
and
ancient
game
by
speaking
as
trent
made
his
strokes
never
in
his
ten
years
of
golf
had
trent
played
such
a
game
it
was
characteristic
of
him
to
do
his
best
when
conditions
were
worst
when
the
game
was
over
at
the
thirteenth
hole
dangerfield
turned
crossly
to
blackhall
you
played
a
rotten
game
he
said
i
never
played
a
better
that
golfer
exclaimed
the
whole
trouble
with
me
was
that
i
was
up
against
a
better
it
may
be
observed
that
blackhall
was
a
sportsman
dangerfield
was
astonished
and
gratified
next
day
when
he
was
essaying
some
approaching
to
find
trent
watching
his
efforts
in
a
not
unfriendly
spirit
the
trouble
with
you
said
the
younger
player
graciously
is
that
you
chop
your
stroke
instead
of
carrying
through
i
ll
show
you
what
i
in
the
half
hour
he
devoted
to
dangerfield
he
improved
the
millionaire
s
game
six
strokes
a
round
it
would
be
no
fun
to
play
with
you
he
said
when
dangerfield
again
invited
him
but
i
hate
to
see
a
man
trying
to
approach
as
you
did
when
a
little
help
could
put
him
thus
were
any
dangerfield
suspicions
disarmed
he
helped
him
once
or
twice
more
and
on
every
occasion
insisted
that
the
hovering
attendant
be
sent
away
your
keeper
said
trent
genially
puts
me
off
my
keeper
grinned
dangerfield
i
m
not
as
bad
as
that
he
s
my
two
days
before
the
ball
at
the
uplands
it
was
observed
that
anthony
trent
visited
the
nineteenth
hole
more
frequently
and
stayed
there
longer
he
was
playing
less
golf
now
the
bartender
confided
in
dangerfield
who
was
also
a
consistent
patron
that
he
was
drinking
heavily
i
guess
said
the
tender
of
the
bar
with
the
sapience
of
his
kind
that
he
s
one
of
these
quiet
periodic
souses
they
tell
me
he
has
the
stuff
sent
up
to
his
too
bad
said
dangerfield
shaking
his
head
as
he
ordered
another
it
was
true
that
to
trent
s
room
much
dry
gin
and
lemon
juice
found
its
way
together
with
siphons
of
iced
carbonic
the
carbonic
and
the
lemon
juice
was
drunk
since
a
belated
heat
wave
was
visiting
the
sunset
park
hotel
the
gin
found
its
way
into
his
flower
laden
window
boxes
which
should
have
bloomed
into
juniper
berries
trent
liked
a
drink
as
well
as
any
other
golfer
but
he
found
that
it
just
took
the
keen
edge
off
his
nerves
he
was
less
keen
to
realize
danger
and
too
ready
to
meet
a
risk
when
he
drank
as
a
conscientious
workman
he
put
it
behind
him
when
professionally
engaged
on
the
night
of
the
ball
he
was
to
quote
a
bell
boy
dead
to
the
world
which
proves
that
bell
boys
may
be
deceived
by
appearances
on
the
night
of
the
ball
he
was
keyed
up
to
his
highest
personal
efficiency
physically
he
was
at
his
best
his
muscles
were
always
hard
and
his
wind
good
the
resisting
exercises
he
practised
maintained
the
former
and
a
little
running
every
day
aided
the
latter
the
great
costume
ball
was
to
take
place
on
the
third
of
september
when
the
sun
would
set
at
six
the
uplands
was
no
more
than
a
half
hour
motor
spin
distant
from
the
hotel
the
time
set
was
nine
which
meant
few
would
be
there
before
ten
it
was
plain
then
that
jerome
dangerfield
would
not
commence
her
preparations
for
dressing
until
after
the
dinner
she
was
devoted
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
as
her
maid
lamented
when
she
harnessed
her
mistress
within
her
corsets
looking
from
his
window
trent
saw
that
the
sun
had
retired
behind
clouds
early
in
the
afternoon
darkness
would
not
be
delayed
and
the
success
of
his
venture
depended
upon
this
reviewing
the
amazing
events
of
the
evening
of
september
the
third
it
is
only
fair
to
let
jerome
dangerfield
relieve
his
feelings
in
a
letter
to
his
closest
friend
the
president
of
the
first
agricultural
bank
of
new
york
you
were
right
in
warning
me
not
to
bring
the
mt
aubyn
ruby
up
to
this
place
it
was
adele
s
fault
she
wanted
it
for
the
wedding
the
damned
thing
has
gone
steve
vanished
into
thin
air
if
you
told
me
what
i
m
going
to
tell
you
i
should
say
you
were
crazy
the
people
here
and
the
fool
police
thought
i
d
been
drinking
i
d
had
three
or
four
cocktails
but
what
is
that
to
me
or
you
i
was
absolutely
in
possession
of
my
senses
we
dined
early
and
we
dined
alone
at
eight
i
went
down
for
the
jewels
adele
wanted
to
wear
the
ruby
was
the
de
of
course
i
went
down
my
own
private
stairway
as
usual
and
unlocked
the
door
leading
from
it
to
the
hotel
lobby
devlin
is
here
and
o
brien
but
they
were
both
outside
keeping
tabs
on
strangers
the
papers
have
played
this
costume
ball
up
so
much
that
every
crook
in
the
land
knew
what
we
had
to
offer
in
the
way
of
loot
graham
the
hotel
clerk
came
with
me
to
the
private
stairway
and
swears
he
pushed
the
door
to
as
i
started
to
go
up
the
stairs
and
he
swears
also
that
although
it
wasn
t
lighted
as
well
as
usual
there
was
nobody
in
sight
they
are
steep
stairs
steve
but
they
save
me
rubbing
shoulders
with
every
man
or
woman
who
might
want
to
get
acquainted
in
the
public
elevators
and
naturally
i
wasn
t
carrying
a
fortune
where
any
crook
could
get
a
crack
at
me
read
this
carefully
i
was
on
the
fifteenth
step
of
the
flight
of
steps
when
the
thing
happened
the
light
was
dim
because
one
of
the
bulbs
wasn
t
working
and
the
only
illumination
came
from
a
red
light
at
the
head
of
the
stairway
i
was
holding
the
jewel
box
in
both
hands
resting
it
almost
on
my
chest
when
the
thing
happened
there
was
suddenly
a
noise
that
might
have
been
made
by
the
beating
of
wings
and
something
swooped
out
of
nowhere
and
hit
me
on
my
wrists
with
such
violence
that
i
went
backwards
down
the
stairs
and
was
unconscious
for
more
than
ten
minutes
on
each
wrist
there
is
an
abrasion
that
might
be
caused
by
the
sharp
bill
of
a
big
bird
i
m
bruised
all
over
and
have
three
stitches
over
one
eye
i
found
the
box
lying
on
one
of
the
steps
closed
as
i
had
held
it
only
thing
that
was
missing
was
the
mt
aubyn
ruby
devlin
and
o
brien
have
all
kinds
of
theories
but
i
told
them
i
wanted
the
stone
back
and
if
they
didn
t
get
it
i
wouldn
t
have
them
any
longer
in
my
employ
devlin
says
he
will
swear
a
car
passed
him
on
the
boston
road
yesterday
containing
some
continental
crooks
who
used
to
operate
along
the
italian
and
french
riviera
he
s
full
of
wild
fancies
and
swears
i
shall
get
the
ruby
back
i
m
not
so
sure
i
ve
given
up
the
theory
that
it
was
a
great
black
bat
which
hit
me
but
whatever
it
was
it
was
a
stunt
pulled
by
a
master
craftsman
who
is
laughing
at
devlin
and
his
kind
can
you
imagine
a
crook
who
would
leave
behind
what
this
fellow
did
i
wish
you
d
go
to
the
pemberton
detective
agency
and
get
them
to
send
some
one
up
here
capable
of
handling
the
situation
i
shall
be
coming
down
to
new
york
as
soon
as
i
m
able
i
m
too
much
bruised
to
play
golf
but
when
i
do
i
shall
win
some
of
your
money
i
ve
had
some
lessons
from
a
crackerjack
golfer
up
here
who
goes
round
the
eighteen
holes
in
anything
from
to
my
stance
was
wrong
and
i
wasn
t
gripping
so
much
for
jerome
dangerfield
when
devlin
and
o
brien
examined
the
scene
of
the
crime
they
immediately
noticed
that
some
fifteen
feet
above
the
ground
level
a
stained
glass
window
lighted
the
stairway
of
course
they
exclaimed
in
unison
that
is
the
but
the
theory
did
not
hold
water
as
the
soil
of
the
showed
no
sign
of
a
ladder
or
any
footmark
they
had
been
raked
over
that
afternoon
and
the
gardener
swore
no
foot
but
his
had
set
foot
in
this
enclosed
garden
which
supplied
the
hotel
tables
with
blooms
an
examination
of
the
window
showed
no
helpful
finger
marks
it
was
an
indoor
job
they
declared
amending
their
first
opinion
but
they
were
thorough
workmen
in
their
way
for
instance
anthony
trent
reclining
fully
dressed
across
his
bed
with
cigarette
stubs
and
emptied
glasses
about
him
within
thirty
minutes
of
the
robbery
was
evidently
in
fear
of
interruption
an
onlooker
would
have
seen
him
take
three
gin
fizzes
in
rapid
succession
until
indeed
his
face
wore
a
faint
flush
he
listened
keenly
when
outside
his
door
footsteps
lingered
and
he
was
snoring
alcoholically
when
the
hotel
clerk
entered
bringing
with
him
devlin
and
o
brien
he
s
been
like
this
for
days
graham
the
clerk
asserted
if
it
wasn
t
that
he
was
no
trouble
and
made
no
noise
i
should
have
told
him
to
get
out
a
pity
graham
shook
his
head
one
of
the
men
in
the
hotel
and
some
golfer
they
tell
you
leave
us
devlin
commanded
we
are
acting
for
the
boss
and
it
ll
be
all
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
trent
watched
the
two
trained
men
make
a
thorough
examination
of
his
room
and
effects
indeed
their
thoroughness
gave
him
ideas
which
were
later
to
prove
of
use
but
they
drew
blank
they
examined
the
two
fly
rods
he
had
brought
with
him
and
a
collapsible
landing
net
with
great
care
tapping
the
handles
and
balancing
the
rods
they
sighed
when
nothing
was
found
this
guy
is
all
right
said
o
brien
i
don
t
know
said
devlin
he
looks
a
little
too
much
like
a
hero
to
suit
me
he
may
have
it
on
at
this
moment
trent
sat
up
with
an
effort
and
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
visitors
as
drunken
men
do
it
appeared
not
easy
to
get
them
in
proper
focus
devlin
was
not
easily
put
in
the
wrong
his
manner
was
most
respectful
mr
dangerfield
wants
you
to
join
him
in
a
little
game
of
bridge
he
began
ingratiatingly
sure
said
the
inebriate
any
time
at
he
attempted
to
get
up
you
can
t
go
like
this
devlin
assured
him
you
d
better
sober
up
a
bit
take
a
cold
o
brien
obligingly
turned
the
water
on
and
five
minutes
later
devlin
assisted
him
into
the
tub
while
o
brien
examined
the
clothes
he
had
left
in
his
then
the
two
left
him
abruptly
and
made
no
more
mention
of
bridge
or
dangerfield
trent
rolled
on
the
bed
chuckling
the
honors
were
his
the
great
black
bird
swooping
from
nowhere
to
relieve
dangerfield
of
his
great
ruby
and
other
stones
of
value
to
strike
that
worthy
upon
his
strong
wrists
with
such
startling
effect
as
to
make
him
fall
down
a
dozen
steps
was
capable
of
a
simpler
explanation
than
he
had
supposed
trent
a
week
before
the
robbery
had
observed
with
peculiar
attention
the
window
leading
to
dangerfield
s
private
stairway
he
could
see
one
easy
approach
to
it
and
one
of
greater
difficulty
the
first
was
approach
by
a
the
second
was
a
great
arm
of
the
enormous
tree
that
reared
its
head
above
the
hotel
roof
this
arm
hung
down
from
the
roof
almost
twenty
feet
above
the
little
window
he
believed
that
his
weight
would
bring
it
swaying
down
to
the
he
tried
it
one
moonless
night
and
found
the
scheme
feasible
already
the
chiller
mountain
breezes
following
the
heat
spell
were
making
visitors
close
their
windows
on
the
evening
of
the
third
of
september
he
stole
from
his
room
by
climbing
over
the
roof
until
he
came
to
the
side
where
the
big
tree
was
in
one
hand
he
held
a
coil
of
rope
to
hold
the
branch
when
his
weight
was
taken
off
it
this
rope
he
tied
to
the
iron
staple
of
the
shutter
outside
the
window
it
was
easy
to
open
this
dropping
silently
on
to
the
stairs
he
unscrewed
the
bulb
of
the
light
until
the
staircase
was
in
partial
darkness
tense
he
knelt
on
the
edge
of
the
window
and
waited
for
the
millionaire
and
as
the
man
came
in
sight
he
suddenly
lifted
from
a
step
his
landing
net
the
same
collapsible
one
devlin
had
examined
with
such
care
but
this
time
it
was
draped
in
dark
material
to
conceal
its
form
the
brass
rim
sharp
and
heavy
struck
dangerfield
s
wrists
as
he
held
the
box
by
both
hands
on
a
level
with
his
heart
into
the
open
net
the
precious
casket
fell
silently
trent
was
in
his
room
ten
minutes
ere
dangerfield
came
to
consciousness
his
next
move
seemed
strange
and
unnecessary
with
a
used
golf
ball
in
his
pocket
he
slid
down
the
veranda
posts
until
he
came
by
devious
routes
to
the
shed
in
which
the
lockers
were
of
those
who
used
the
links
it
had
long
since
been
closed
for
the
night
parker
unfastened
dangerfield
s
locker
and
placed
the
ball
in
the
pocket
where
it
lay
with
others
of
similar
age
and
make
he
was
able
to
return
to
his
room
unobserved
it
was
less
than
a
half
hour
afterward
that
he
received
his
call
from
the
two
detectives
although
he
was
anxious
to
get
on
the
links
again
and
breathe
the
air
of
the
pine
woods
he
was
careful
not
to
undo
his
artistic
preparations
it
was
noticed
that
no
more
drink
was
sent
to
his
room
there
came
instead
ice
water
and
strong
coffee
he
was
getting
over
it
they
said
two
days
later
he
was
out
on
the
links
and
made
a
peculiarly
bad
round
taking
ten
more
strokes
than
usual
dangerfield
watched
him
from
the
piazza
one
of
his
arms
was
in
a
sling
cut
the
rough
stuff
out
said
dangerfield
that
s
the
second
time
you
topped
your
trent
passed
a
hand
across
his
face
possibly
to
hide
a
smile
i
guess
i
ll
have
to
he
returned
simply
it
was
that
damned
heat
wave
that
got
me
it
happened
that
the
dangerfields
and
trent
returned
to
new
york
on
the
same
train
devlin
and
o
brien
were
in
attendance
trent
noticed
that
when
devlin
s
eye
fell
on
the
golf
bag
over
his
shoulder
he
frowned
so
far
the
ruby
had
not
been
recovered
and
here
was
a
piece
of
baggage
that
might
hold
crown
jewels
over
devlin
s
broad
shoulders
his
master
s
golf
bag
was
suspended
cheerily
and
with
respect
he
approached
the
crack
player
let
me
hold
your
golf
bag
sir
he
said
with
a
ready
smile
i
ll
put
it
on
the
train
for
trent
relinquished
it
with
relief
thank
you
he
returned
it
will
be
a
he
had
long
ago
noticed
that
his
own
bag
and
dangerfield
s
were
alike
save
for
the
initials
they
were
both
of
white
canvas
bound
with
black
leather
watching
the
smiling
devlin
with
a
curiosity
he
saw
that
dangerfield
s
bag
had
been
substituted
for
his
own
devlin
had
done
exactly
as
trent
expected
him
to
do
and
had
in
the
doing
of
it
saved
him
much
trouble
there
were
not
many
people
in
his
pullman
dangerfield
had
his
private
car
none
saw
anthony
trent
open
the
ball
pouch
on
the
dangerfield
bag
and
extract
therefrom
an
aged
and
somewhat
dented
ball
he
balanced
it
almost
lovingly
in
his
hand
never
in
the
history
of
the
great
game
had
a
ball
been
seen
with
the
worth
of
this
one
and
yet
he
had
so
cunningly
extracted
its
core
and
repaired
it
when
once
the
mount
aubyn
ruby
was
nestling
in
its
strange
home
that
detection
was
unlikely
even
were
an
examination
made
a
porter
had
the
dangerfield
bag
and
trent
s
suitcase
when
devlin
came
up
to
him
he
was
no
longer
obliging
he
had
spent
wearisome
hours
in
the
privacy
of
the
dangerfield
car
examining
every
part
of
the
trent
impedimenta
the
task
had
wearied
him
and
had
been
fruitless
you
got
the
boss
s
clubs
he
said
shortly
languidly
trent
examined
what
his
porter
carried
you
re
to
blame
for
it
he
answered
and
as
dangerfield
came
up
raised
his
voice
a
little
he
knew
devlin
suspected
him
and
he
sensed
that
some
day
the
two
would
meet
as
open
foes
this
man
of
yours
cried
trent
tried
to
give
me
your
clubs
instead
of
my
own
i
wouldn
t
lose
mine
for
you
crack
golfers
couldn
t
do
anything
without
your
own
specially
built
clubs
jeered
the
millionaire
i
believe
it
s
half
the
trent
smiled
there
s
something
in
the
ball
too
he
admitted
and
had
difficulty
in
keeping
his
face
straight
kinney
was
delighted
to
see
her
employer
home
again
and
hurried
to
a
convenient
delicatessen
store
so
that
he
might
be
fed
it
was
when
she
came
back
that
her
eye
caught
sight
of
the
brass
lamp
from
benares
where
had
been
the
unsightly
gap
caused
by
her
breaking
of
the
red
glass
was
now
a
piece
which
glittered
gaily
why
you
ve
had
it
mended
sir
she
cried
i
feel
i
ought
to
pay
for
it
since
it
was
my
carelessness
which
broke
i
m
glad
you
did
he
laughed
if
you
hadn
t
i
shouldn
t
have
got
he
looked
at
it
with
pride
do
you
know
kinney
i
like
this
one
it
makes
the
other
ones
look
common
though
she
commented
you
re
right
he
admitted
i
think
i
shall
have
to
replace
them

before

of
the

had
seen
anthony
trent
about
to
enter
xeres
excellent
restaurant
lacking
no
assurance
weems
tacked
himself
on
to
his
friend
say
do
you
feed
here
he
demanded
and
looked
with
respect
at
his
friend
s
raiment
only
when
i
m
hungry
trent
retorted
he
knew
it
was
useless
to
try
to
get
rid
of
weems
have
you
dined
thanks
said
weems
i
don
t
mind
if
i
in
those
days
weems
was
proud
as
the
owner
of
the
finest
camp
on
lake
kennebago
he
was
high
stomached
and
generous
of
advice
he
told
trent
so
much
of
a
certain
stock
a
gold
mine
in
colorado
that
at
last
he
purchased
a
considerable
interest
in
it
later
he
learned
that
weems
had
unloaded
worthless
stock
on
him
trent
bore
no
sort
of
malice
he
had
gone
into
the
thing
and
weems
as
he
knew
of
yore
never
sold
at
a
loss
weems
had
been
wiser
to
have
held
his
stock
for
tungsten
in
large
quantities
was
discovered
and
what
cost
trent
five
thousand
dollars
was
now
worth
ten
times
that
amount
it
was
one
evening
shortly
after
his
adventures
with
the
baron
von
eckstein
that
weems
called
him
up
on
the
telephone
that
he
was
able
to
do
so
annoyed
trent
who
had
carefully
concealed
his
number
but
horace
weems
had
secured
it
by
a
use
of
mendacity
and
with
it
the
number
and
the
address
he
said
he
was
phoning
from
a
nearby
drug
store
and
was
about
to
pay
a
visit
weems
was
ill
at
ease
and
he
was
unshaven
and
his
shoes
no
longer
shone
with
radiance
his
disheveled
appearance
and
attitude
of
dejection
swept
away
his
host

annoyance
he
took
a
stiff
scotch
and

he
announced

it
in

happened

demanded

that
wall

sore
on
me
and
hadn
t
the
sense
to
see
the
danger
weems
soothed
his
throat
with
another
stiff
drink
the
trouble
with
me
is
i
m
too
courageous
i
knew
what
i
was
up
against
but
did
that
frighten
me
no
siree
no
boss
i
went
for
em
like
you
used
to
go
through
a
bunch
of
forwards
in
a

game
i
m
like
a
bull
terrier
i
m
all

don
t
worry
me
they
pulled
me
down
at
last
but
it
took
all
the
best
brains
in
the
street
to
do
it
they
hate
a
comer
and
i
m
that
well
this
is
the
first
round
and
they
win
on
points
but
this
isn

bout

nothing

or
weems
was
a
long
time
coming
to
the
point
when
he
did
it
was
revealed
as
a
loan
a
temporary
loan
it
s
like
this
said
the
ingenuous
weems
when
i
sold
you
those
shares
in
a
tungsten
mine
i
did
it
because
you
were
a
you
did
it
trent
reminded
him
because
you
hadn
t
a
faint
idea
there
was
tungsten
there
and
you
thought
you
d
done
something
mighty
clever
what
next
you
needn
t
be
sore
about
it
weems
returned
you
made
i
m
not
sore
trent
said
smiling
you
did
me
a
good
turn
but
i
don
t
have
to
be
grateful
all
things
considering
how
much
do
you
want
i
shall
get
back
weems
said
a
little
sulkily
i
only
want
a
hundred
or
maybe
two
hundred
although
five
hundred
would
see
me
through
till
i
get
the
money
for
the
you
are
not
going
to
sell
that
trent
cried
it
was
of
all
places
the
one
he
craved
got
to
weems
asserted
who
is
going
to
buy
it
a
fellow
from
cleveland
named
i
remember
him
trent
said
frowning
he
s
a
hog
a
fish
hog
all
the
guides
hate
him
what
s
he
going
to
give
you
forty
thousand
said
weems
constable
grand
piano
and
all
the
piano
s
there
weems
told
him
but
the
picture
is
sold
honest
tony
that
picture
surprised
me
senator
scrivener
gave
me
ten
thousand
dollars
for
it
just
some
trees
an
old
barn
and
some
horses
looking
over
a
gate
what
do
you
know
about
that
that
helped
me
you
re
such
a
damned
liar
weems
that
i
never
believe
you
but
i
ll
swear
rumleigh
isn
t
paying
you
forty
thousand
dollars
for
that
camp
it
s
a
good
camp
but
if
you
ve
got
to
sell
in
a
hurry
he
ll
hold
you
down
to
less
than
that
be
honest
for
once
and
tell
me
what
he
s
going
to
thousand
weems
said
sullenly
i
ll
give
you
said
trent
carelessly
his
is
a
cash
offer
weems
said
shaking
his
head
and
that
s
why
i
m
selling
so
trent
took
a
roll
of
bills
from
his
pocket
and
peeled
off
before
weems
astounded
eyes
five
and
twenty
thousand
dollars
mine
is
also
a
cash
offer
he
observed
come
right
off
to
my
lawyer
weems
cried
springing
to
his
feet
gee
and
i
thought
you
hadn
t
as
much
money
as
i
thus
it
was
that
anthony
trent
came
into
possession
of
his
camp
it
was
a
beautiful
place
and
there
were
improvements
which
he
planned
that
would
cost
a
lot
to
execute
he
decided
that
it
might
be
unwise
to
retire
yet
from
a
profession
which
paid
him
such
rewards
another
year
and
he
could
lay
aside
his
present
work
satisfied
that
financial
worries
need
never
trouble
him
he
admitted
that
many
unfortunate
things
might
happen
in
twelve
months
but
he
was
serene
in
the
belief
that
his
star
was
in
the
ascendant

wanted
an
emerald
since
anthony
trent
had
replaced
the
red
glass
in
his
benares
lamp
with
the
mount
aubyn
ruby
the
other
pieces
of
cut
glass
seemed
so
dull
by
comparison
that
had
his
visitors
been
many
suspicion
must
have
arisen
from
the
very
difference
they
exhibited
the
lamp
was
discreetly
swung
in
a
distant
corner
and
the
button
which
lighted
the
lamp
carefully
concealed
reading
one
morning
that
owing
to
the
financial
trouble
into
which
the
war
had
plunged
a
great
west
of
england
family
the
celebrated
edgcumbe
sapphire
had
been
purchased
by
a
new
york
manufacturer
of
ammunition
one
of
the
new
millionaires
created
by
the
war
to
buy
what
other
countries
had
to
sacrifice
the
papers
gave
every
necessary
particular
at
ten
o
clock
one
morning
anthony
trent
sallied
forth
to
loot
by
dinner
time
the
edgcumbe
sapphire
had
replaced
the
blue
cube
of
cut
glass
and
in
his
lamp
the
papers
were
devoting
front
page
space
to
its
daring
abduction
how
he
accomplished
it
properly
belongs
to
another
chapter
in
the
life
of
the
master
criminal
so
easy
was
it
of
consummation
that
he
planned
to
use
the
same
technique
for
a
greater
coup
when
these
two
great
stones
were
making
his
brazen
lamp
a
thing
of
flashing
beauty
they
threw
into
infinite
dullness
the
cube
of
green
looking
at
it
night
after
night
when
kinney
was
long
abed
and
the
grateful
silences
had
drowned
the
noise
of
day
anthony
trent
longed
for
an
emerald
to
bear
these
lordly
jewels
company
there
was
an
excellent
book
store
on
street
between
seventh
avenue
and
sixth
where
he
browsed
often
among
waiting
volumes
one
day
he
picked
up
a
book
written
in
french
romances
of
precious
it
was
by
a
madame
sernin
grandniece
of
the
great
russian
novelist
feoder
vladimir
larrovitch
trent
remembered
that
he
had
read
her
translation
of
and
and
looked
at
this
original
work
with
interest
it
was
published
in
paris
just
before
the
war
he
knew
well
that
most
of
the
great
stones
which
had
became
famous
historically
were
still
in
europe
and
europe
until
the
long
war
was
over
was
closed
to
him
he
hoped
madame
sernin
had
something
to
say
about
jewels
there
was
a
reference
in
the
index
and
later
in
his
rooms
he
read
it
eagerly
there
were
mme
sernin
announced
but
two
of
the
great
emeralds
in
the
united
states
one
belonged
to
the
wife
of
the
colombian
minister
and
was
found
in
colombia
trent
considered
this
stone
carefully
it
might
not
be
in
the
united
states
after
all
mme
sernin
was
doubtful
herself
but
of
the
second
stone
she
was
certain
it
was
known
as
the
takowaja
emerald
a
century
and
a
half
before
it
had
been
dug
from
the
ural
mountains
that
great
the
second
catherine
of
russia
had
given
it
to
her
favorite
gregory
orlov
who
had
sold
it
to
a
traveling
english
noble
in
a
day
before
american
gold
was
known
in
continental
europe
it
was
now
the
property
of
andrew
apthorpe
of
boston
in
massachusetts
presumably
the
man
was
a
collector
and
assuredly
he
was
wealthy
but
anthony
trent
had
never
heard
of
him
a
trip
by
boat
to
boston
would
make
a
pleasant
break
and
a
day
later
he
was
steaming
north
his
inevitable
golf
clubs
accompanied
him
trent
was
one
of
those
players
whose
game
suffer
little
if
short
of
practice
and
of
late
he
had
not
stinted
himself
of
play
he
told
kinney
he
was
going
to
edgartown
for
a
few
days
he
had
sometimes
played
around
these
island
links
and
his
bag
of
clubs
was
always
an
excellent
excuse
for
traveling
in
strange
parts
directly
he
had
registered
at
the
adams
house
he
consulted
a
city
directory
andrew
apthorpe
s
town
house
was
in
the
same
block
on
beacon
street
which
held
the
clent
bulstrode
mansion
it
was
a
vast
forbidding
residence
of
red
brick
running
back
to
the
charles
embankment
the
windows
were
small
and
barred
and
the
shades
drawn
an
empty
milk
bottle
and
a
morning
paper
at
a
basement
door
gave
evidence
of
occupancy
and
at
the
garage
at
the
rear
a
burly
chauffeur
was
cleaning
the
brass
work
of
a
touring
car
looking
wisely
and
suspiciously
at
trent
as
he
sauntered
by
was
an
airedale
the
family
trent
surmised
was
absent
and
the
caretaker
who
rose
late
if
the
neglected
post
was
a
sign
and
this
man
and
dog
were
left
to
guard
the
place
if
the
takowaja
emerald
were
housed
here
with
two
such
guardians
its
recovery
might
not
be
difficult
but
the
more
trent
thought
of
it
the
more
improbable
it
seemed
that
the
owner
of
such
a
gem
should
leave
it
prey
to
any
organized
attack
the
curious
part
about
this
ural
emerald
was
that
trent
had
never
before
heard
of
it
and
he
knew
american
owned
stones
well
most
of
the
owners
of
famous
jewels
were
ready
to
talk
of
them
lend
them
for
exhibition
purposes
when
they
were
properly
guarded
but
he
had
never
seen
a
line
about
the
apthorpe
emerald
a
few
minutes
before
midday
anthony
trent
strolled
into
the
ames
building
and
saw
that
andrew
apthorpe
cotton
broker
occupied
very
large
offices
a
little
later
he
followed
one
of
the
apthorpe
clerks
a
young
man
to
the
place
where
he
lunched
it
was
curiously
unlike
a
new
york
restaurant
circular
mahogany
counters
surrounded
self
possessed
young
women
who
permitted
themselves
to
attend
to
those
who
hungered
to
such
as
they
knew
and
liked
they
were
affable
to
others
their
front
was
cold
and
severe
the
apthorpe
employee
was
a
favorite
apt
at
retort
and
not
ill
pleased
if
others
noted
it
soon
he
drifted
into
conversation
with
trent
who
with
his
careful
mind
had
read
through
the
column
devoted
to
cotton
in
the
morning
papers
and
was
ready
with
a
carefully
remembered
phrase
or
two
for
the
stranger
who
responded
in
kind
gradually
by
way
of
the
red
sox
the
beauties
of
norumbega
park
and
the
architectural
qualities
of
keith
s
the
young
man
lapsed
into
personalities
and
told
anthony
trent
all
he
desired
to
know
of
andrew
apthorpe
andrew
it
seemed
was
not
beloved
of
his
employees
he
was
unappreciative
of
merit
unless
it
accompanied
female
beauty
he
was
old
he
was
his
family
had
abandoned
him
with
the
sincere
reluctance
that
wealth
is
ever
abandoned
he
lives
up
at
groton
said
trent
s
loquacious
informant
in
a
sort
of
castle
on
a
hill
fitted
with
every
burglar
resisting
device
that
was
ever
what
s
he
afraid
of
trent
demanded
he
s
got
a
lot
of
valuables
the
other
answered
cut
gems
and
cameos
and
intaglios
and
things
that
wouldn
t
interest
any
one
but
an
old
miser
like
him
i
have
to
go
up
there
once
in
a
while
the
old
boy
has
an
automatic
in
his
pocket
all
the
while
i
think
he
s
there
were
two
or
three
men
at
camp
devens
whom
trent
knew
slightly
the
camp
was
within
walking
distance
of
groton
he
learned
by
half
past
nine
on
the
following
morning
anthony
trent
left
ayer
behind
him
and
breasted
the
rising
ground
towards
groton
he
could
go
to
the
camp
later
he
might
not
go
at
all
but
if
questioned
as
to
his
presence
the
excuse
would
be
a
just
one
he
was
always
anxious
that
his
motives
would
pass
muster
with
the
police
if
ever
he
came
in
contact
with
them
after
a
couple
of
miles
he
came
in
sight
of
the
beautiful
tower
of
groton
school
chapel
two
or
three
times
he
had
played
for
his
school
against
this
famous
institution
in
the
years
that
seemed
now
so
far
behind
him
the
town
of
groton
some
distance
from
the
more
modern
school
charmed
his
senses
restful
houses
among
immemorial
elms
well
kept
gardens
and
a
general
air
of
contentment
made
the
town
one
to
be
remembered
even
in
new
england
he
hoped
he
would
be
able
to
find
something
about
apthorpe
from
some
local
historian
without
having
to
lead
openly
to
the
matter
a
luncheon
at
the
famous
inn
might
discover
some
such
informant
but
he
was
not
destined
to
enter
that
admirable
hostelry
for
coming
toward
him
with
dignified
carriage
and
an
aura
of
fragrant
havana
smoke
about
him
was
westward
whom
he
had
known
slightly
at
kennebago
this
westward
was
the
most
widely
known
fisherman
on
the
famous
lake
an
authority
wherever
men
foregathered
trent
would
have
preferred
to
meet
none
who
knew
him
by
name
this
was
a
professional
adventure
and
not
a
trout
fishing
vacation
but
the
angler
had
already
recognized
him
and
there
was
no
help
for
it
westward
rather
liked
anthony
trent
as
he
liked
all
men
who
were
skilled
in
the
use
of
the
and
were
in
his
own
published
words
why
my
dear
fellow
said
westward
genially
what
are
you
doing
in
my
home
town
i
d
no
idea
you
lived
here
trent
said
shaking
his
hand
i
thought
you
were
a
new
westward
pointed
to
a
modest
house
this
is
what
i
call
my
office
he
explained
i
do
my
writing
there
and
house
my
fishing
tackle
and
my
i
wish
you
d
let
me
see
them
trent
suggested
smiling
i
ve
often
marveled
at
the
way
you
catch
it
was
past
twelve
when
he
had
finished
talking
over
what
westward
had
to
show
he
realized
he
had
forgotten
the
matter
which
brought
him
to
groton
when
westward
asked
him
to
luncheon
he
hesitated
a
moment
this
hesitation
was
born
not
of
a
disinclination
to
accept
the
angler
s
hospitality
but
rather
to
the
feeling
that
he
was
out
for
business
and
if
he
failed
at
it
might
be
led
as
a
criminal
to
whatever
jail
was
handy
and
were
he
thus
a
prisoner
it
would
embarrass
a
good
sportsman
but
westward
gained
his
point
and
led
trent
to
a
big
rambling
house
further
down
the
street
that
was
a
rich
store
house
of
the
old
and
quaint
furniture
of
colonial
days
westward
proved
to
be
a
woman
of
charm
and
culture
endowed
with
a
quick
wit
and
a
gift
of
entertaining
comment
on
what
local
happenings
were
out
of
the
ordinary
has
charles
told
you
of
the
murder
she
asked
we
ve
been
talking
fish
anthony
trent
explained
oh
you
fishermen
she
laughed
i
often
tell
my
husband
he
won
t
take
any
notice
of
the
last
trump
if
he
s
fishing
or
talking
of
trout
we
actually
had
a
murder
here
last
i
hope
it
was
some
one
who
could
be
easily
spared
trent
returned
and
not
a
i
could
spare
him
westward
said
decisively
i
know
his
wife
and
she
has
my
friendship
but
for
andrew
apthorpe
i
have
never
apthorpe
trent
cried
the
cotton
man
the
same
westward
assured
him
anthony
trent
was
suddenly
all
attention
he
surmised
that
the
murder
of
so
rich
a
man
was
actuated
by
a
desire
for
his
collection
and
if
so
where
was
the
takowaja
emerald
please
tell
me
he
entreated
murders
fascinate
me
if
the
penalty
were
not
so
severe
i
should
engage
in
murder
constantly
what
was
it
revenge
robbery
yes
and
no
charles
westward
observed
with
that
judicial
air
which
confounded
questioners
revenge
no
doubt
robbery
perhaps
but
we
are
awaiting
the
arrival
of
apthorpe
and
her
daughter
we
shall
not
know
until
then
whether
his
collection
of
valuables
has
been
what
about
the
revenge
theory
trent
inquired
apthorpe
made
many
enemies
as
a
younger
man
physically
he
was
violent
there
are
no
doubt
many
who
detested
him
personally
i
had
no
quarrel
with
him
i
sent
him
a
mess
of
trout
from
the
unkety
brook
this
season
and
had
a
little
talk
with
him
over
the
phone
but
he
saw
few
except
his
lawyer
and
business
is
any
one
suspected
in
particular
trent
asked
the
whole
thing
is
mysterious
westward
declared
with
animation
last
night
at
eight
o
clock
i
received
a
telephone
message
from
his
nurse
a
miss
thompson
a
woman
i
hardly
know
once
or
twice
i
have
seen
her
at
the
red
cross
meetings
but
that
is
all
she
apologized
for
calling
but
said
she
felt
nervous
it
seems
that
apthorpe
had
let
all
the
servants
go
off
to
the
band
concert
at
ayer
there
were
two
automobiles
filled
with
them
the
only
people
left
were
miss
thompson
in
the
house
and
a
gardener
who
lives
in
a
cottage
on
the
grounds
they
left
the
house
just
after
dinner
say
half
past
seven
at
a
quarter
to
eight
a
stranger
called
to
see
accurately
timed
commented
westward
miss
thompson
declined
to
admit
him
you
must
understand
trent
that
andrew
apthorpe
was
a
very
sick
man
heart
trouble
mainly
and
she
was
within
her
rights
the
man
who
would
not
give
his
name
put
his
foot
in
the
door
and
said
he
would
see
apthorpe
if
he
waited
there
all
night
while
she
was
arguing
with
him
begging
him
in
fact
to
go
away
her
employer
came
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
that
lead
from
the
main
rooms
to
the
hall
miss
thompson
explained
what
had
happened
to
her
surprise
he
said
i
have
been
expecting
him
for
twenty
years
let
him
why
should
she
call
you
up
trent
asked
merely
because
she
was
nervous
and
knew
other
people
even
less
than
she
did
westward
hesitated
a
moment
there
have
been
rumors
about
her
and
apthorpe
which
were
not
pleasant
they
were
probably
not
true
but
when
a
man
has
lived
as
he
had
it
was
not
surprising
she
called
me
up
at
eight
because
the
two
men
were
quarreling
my
husband
told
you
he
was
a
man
of
violent
temper
that
is
putting
it
mildly
i
told
her
there
was
nothing
to
be
alarmed
about
at
nine
she
called
me
up
again
to
say
that
she
would
be
grateful
if
westward
and
my
nephew
richmond
who
is
staying
with
me
would
go
up
there
as
she
had
heard
blows
struck
and
apthorpe
was
too
ill
to
engage
in
any
sort
of
tussle
i
told
her
my
two
men
were
out
but
that
the
police
should
be
called
in
while
i
was
talking
she
gave
a
shriek
it
was
a
most
dramatic
moment
and
i
could
hear
her
steps
running
from
the
my
nephew
and
i
came
in
at
that
moment
westward
interrupted
and
went
up
the
hill
to
the
house
as
fast
as
possible
westward
meanwhile
had
telephoned
for
the
police
miss
thompson
was
waiting
on
the
steps
she
was
hysterical
and
afraid
to
go
back
into
the
lonely
richmond
said
he
thought
she
had
been
drinking
his
wife
interjected
that
meant
nothing
westward
observed
she
was
hysterical
and
i
don
t
wonder
in
that
great
lonely
house
when
we
went
in
with
the
police
we
found
the
big
living
room
door
locked
with
the
key
on
the
inside
we
had
to
break
it
open
and
found
it
bolted
evidently
the
stranger
had
seen
to
that
old
apthorpe
was
lying
dead
shot
through
the
head
with
a
bullet
from
his
own
revolver
the
window
was
open
there
was
a
drop
to
the
grass
outside
and
the
man
had
lowered
himself
by
a
portiere
so
far
not
a
trace
has
been
found
of
him
a
great
many
people
pass
through
here
on
the
way
to
or
from
boston
and
we
have
become
so
used
to
strangers
that
no
heed
is
paid
to
them
any
was
there
any
evidence
of
robbery
trent
asked
not
a
trace
so
far
as
we
could
see
i
mean
by
that
there
was
no
disorder
things
of
value
might
have
been
taken
but
nothing
had
been
broken
open
we
shan
t
know
until
apthorpe
it
was
evidently
westward
declared
some
man
whom
he
had
been
expecting
miss
thompson
according
to
her
story
did
not
know
the
man
s
name
and
yet
was
told
to
admit
him
it
may
be
the
police
will
find
it
from
i
doubt
it
trent
observed
shaking
his
head
if
it
was
a
man
apthorpe
had
dreaded
for
a
score
of
years
he
wouldn
t
be
corresponding
with
then
why
was
he
admitted
asked
westward
consider
the
circumstances
anthony
trent
reminded
her
he
was
becoming
thoroughly
interested
here
he
was
almost
in
the
house
his
foot
in
the
door
all
the
servants
were
away
no
matter
what
apthorpe
said
he
would
have
got
in
what
more
likely
than
that
the
proud
overbearing
old
man
felt
sufficient
confidence
in
his
nerve
and
his
revolver
or
if
he
didn
t
he
would
not
admit
it
the
curious
part
to
my
mind
was
how
this
unknown
timed
it
so
exactly
he
turned
up
just
as
the
servants
were
going
out
for
the
he
turned
to
westward
why
didn
t
miss
thompson
telephone
for
police
aid
do
you
suppose
does
it
seem
strange
to
you
that
she
telephoned
to
you
instead
knowing
andrew
apthorpe
it
does
not
she
answered
he
would
have
been
furious
if
she
had
done
so
to
begin
with
he
has
had
many
squabbles
with
the
local
authorities
over
trumpery
matters
he
was
most
unpopular
the
last
thing
he
would
have
desired
would
be
to
have
them
in
his
house
none
of
the
servants
were
from
groton
and
he
would
not
have
them
associating
with
local
anthony
trent
ruminated
for
a
little
so
far
nothing
had
been
developed
which
offered
a
reasonable
solution
of
the
problem
and
the
problem
for
him
was
a
different
one
from
that
which
would
confront
the
police
trent
s
problem
was
to
secure
the
takowaja
emerald
so
far
neither
of
the
westwards
had
mentioned
it
probably
for
the
reason
that
they
did
not
know
of
its
existence
it
would
be
unwise
he
decided
to
try
to
lead
them
to
talk
of
the
dead
man
s
collection
of
jewels
but
he
felt
reasonably
certain
in
his
own
mind
that
in
this
carefully
guarded
house
replete
with
burglar
alarms
and
safety
appliances
the
treasure
from
the
ural
mountains
had
been
reposing
within
a
dozen
hours
the
stranger
who
had
come
after
a
score
of
years
and
had
left
murder
in
his
trail
was
more
likely
to
have
come
for
the
great
green
stone
than
anything
else
i
wish
i
could
have
a
look
at
the
place
he
said
presently
amateur
detective
laughed
westward
i
can
t
imagine
anything
being
more
exciting
he
admitted
than
to
follow
this
mysterious
man
except
perhaps
to
be
the
man
himself
and
outwit
the
why
not
take
trent
up
there
charles
plainly
westward
was
not
eager
to
do
so
this
was
due
to
a
dislike
to
invade
premises
under
police
supervision
to
which
he
had
no
business
except
a
friendly
curiosity
still
there
would
be
no
harm
done
he
had
known
the
apthorpes
for
years
and
perhaps
anthony
trent
might
be
an
aid
some
one
had
told
him
trent
was
an
expert
in
the
oil
market
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
him
anything
but
a
man
of
probity
it
might
be
arranged
he
said
slowly
chapter
xxi
the
murder
of
andrew
apthorpe
the
apthorpe
estate
ran
parallel
to
the
main
street
of
the
town
but
the
house
itself
was
perched
on
a
hill
almost
a
mile
distant
from
it
a
long
winding
ascent
led
to
a
big
stone
turreted
mansion
commanding
an
extensive
view
of
the
country
that
lay
about
it
a
well
kept
lawn
three
hundred
yards
in
width
surrounded
the
house
the
place
was
built
westward
explained
by
colonel
crofton
the
railroad
man
on
this
lawn
were
great
beds
of
rhododendrons
which
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
when
apthorpe
bought
it
he
had
them
torn
up
and
sown
in
grass
he
said
the
flower
beds
and
shrubberies
were
places
where
burglars
might
conceal
themselves
by
day
to
break
in
by
he
was
certainly
suspicious
trent
commented
westward
pointed
to
the
house
which
rose
like
a
fortress
above
them
when
crofton
had
it
there
were
windows
on
the
ground
level
and
several
entrances
apthorpe
had
them
filled
with
granite
all
except
that
big
doorway
by
this
time
trent
was
near
enough
to
see
that
the
house
was
not
remote
from
buildings
such
as
the
stables
and
garages
which
are
adjacent
to
most
such
residences
he
remarked
on
the
peculiarity
the
automobiles
are
kept
in
the
basement
of
the
house
westward
explained
the
big
doors
i
pointed
out
to
you
can
not
be
opened
by
the
chauffeurs
when
they
want
to
go
out
or
come
in
they
have
to
phone
for
permission
then
apthorpe
or
some
one
else
would
touch
a
button
in
his
big
living
room
and
the
gates
would
swing
open
he
had
a
searchlight
on
the
tower
until
the
federal
authorities
forbade
it
seems
to
me
he
must
have
lived
in
dread
of
violence
trent
observed
and
yet
why
should
he
he
was
a
well
known
boston
broker
of
an
old
new
england
family
not
the
kind
one
would
think
involved
in
crime
in
fiction
it
is
the
man
who
comes
home
after
spending
half
his
life
in
the
mysterious
east
that
one
suspects
of
robbing
gods
of
their
jeweled
eyes
and
incurring
the
sworn
vengeances
of
their
all
men
who
collect
precious
stones
live
in
dread
charles
westward
said
i
ve
never
seen
any
of
his
things
i
m
not
interested
in
them
particularly
i
ve
always
talked
about
fishing
when
i
ve
been
there
but
it
s
common
knowledge
that
he
was
going
to
leave
his
valuables
to
the
museum
of
fine
arts
one
of
the
things
which
incensed
his
wife
was
that
he
wouldn
t
give
her
or
her
daughter
any
of
the
jewels
but
preferred
to
keep
them
locked
a
flight
of
twenty
granite
steps
led
to
the
main
entrance
two
heavily
built
metal
studded
doors
a
lofty
hall
was
disclosed
with
a
circular
stairway
around
it
leading
from
the
hall
to
what
seemed
the
main
room
on
that
floor
was
a
flight
of
six
steps
the
chestnut
doors
had
been
shattered
obviously
it
was
the
room
in
which
apthorpe
had
met
his
death
for
the
rest
it
looked
in
no
way
different
from
half
a
hundred
other
rooms
in
big
houses
which
trent
had
investigated
professionally
bookshelves
not
more
than
four
feet
in
height
lined
three
sides
of
the
apartment
making
a
pretense
of
reading
the
titles
trent
looked
to
see
whether
they
were
indeed
volumes
or
mere
blinds
the
policeman
in
charge
knowing
westward
well
was
only
too
willing
to
show
him
and
his
friend
what
was
to
be
seen
the
body
he
explained
was
in
an
upper
chamber
one
peculiarity
trent
noted
in
the
book
cases
apparently
there
was
no
way
to
open
them
they
were
of
metal
painted
over
if
keyholes
existed
they
were
hidden
from
view
fearing
that
the
policeman
in
charge
would
notice
his
scrutiny
he
walked
over
to
the
open
window
and
looked
out
it
was
from
this
that
the
murderer
made
his
escape
twelve
feet
below
the
green
closely
cropped
turf
touched
the
granite
foundation
of
the
walls
when
westward
offered
him
a
cigar
he
took
out
his
pipe
instead
and
knocked
out
the
ashes
against
the
window
ledge
westward
heard
an
exclamation
of
annoyance
and
asked
its
cause
then
he
saw
that
while
the
stem
of
the
pipe
remained
in
its
owner
s
hand
the
bowl
had
fallen
to
the
lawn
below
i
won
t
be
a
minute
trent
said
and
went
down
the
main
steps
to
the
grounds
it
was
no
accident
that
led
him
to
drop
his
favorite
briar
his
keen
eyes
had
seen
footprints
in
the
grass
as
he
looked
down
they
might
well
be
the
marks
of
him
who
had
stolen
the
famous
emerald
and
trent
had
decreed
a
private
vendetta
against
one
who
might
have
robbed
him
for
what
he
came
into
massachusetts
searching
for
the
pipe
bowl
which
he
had
instantly
detected
he
made
a
rapid
examination
of
the
ground
there
were
indeed
footprints
made
undoubtedly
by
some
one
dropping
from
the
end
of
the
portiere
to
the
soft
turf
and
as
he
gazed
the
mysterious
man
whom
he
had
suspected
faded
into
thin
air
they
were
the
imprints
of
the
high
heels
that
only
women
wear
carefully
he
followed
them
as
far
as
the
big
gates
of
the
garage
they
were
not
distinct
to
any
but
a
trained
observer
they
were
single
tracks
leading
from
the
grass
beneath
the
window
to
the
garage
not
an
unnecessary
step
had
been
taken
apparently
the
local
police
had
pulled
in
the
portiere
from
the
window
and
had
made
no
examination
of
the
grass
below
trent
noticed
that
a
man
evidently
a
gardener
was
approaching
him
quickly
he
dropped
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
again
among
some
clover
the
man
was
eager
and
obliging
furthermore
he
had
heavily
shod
feet
which
were
already
making
their
impression
on
the
turf
to
the
undoing
of
any
who
might
seek
as
anthony
trent
had
done
to
make
a
careful
examination
already
the
high
heeled
imprints
were
obliterated
when
the
pipe
was
found
the
man
insisted
on
speaking
of
the
murder
he
declared
that
for
an
hour
on
the
fatal
night
a
big
touring
car
had
been
drawn
up
near
his
cottage
in
a
lane
nearby
and
that
two
men
got
out
of
it
leaving
another
in
charge
trent
shook
him
off
as
soon
as
he
could
and
returned
to
the
house
his
previously
held
theories
wholly
upset
he
had
built
them
in
the
facts
or
falsities
carefully
supplied
by
miss
thompson
and
he
was
anxious
to
see
the
lady
it
was
most
likely
that
the
woman
who
had
lowered
herself
from
the
window
was
the
woman
who
had
committed
the
murder
and
for
what
could
the
crimes
have
been
committed
so
readily
as
the
takowaja
emerald
he
recalled
now
that
there
had
been
a
certain
reserve
in
the
westwards
manner
when
they
had
spoken
of
miss
thompson
might
they
not
have
suspected
her
and
yet
feared
to
voice
these
suspicions
to
a
stranger
as
he
thought
it
over
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
not
of
the
crime
of
murder
they
suspected
her
but
perhaps
because
of
her
relations
with
so
notorious
a
man
as
the
late
andrew
apthorpe
he
remembered
that
the
dead
man
s
family
was
alienated
from
him
possibly
for
this
very
reason
he
was
given
an
opportunity
very
shortly
to
see
the
nurse
she
came
along
the
hall
not
seeing
him
as
he
stood
in
the
entrance
and
made
her
way
toward
westward
she
was
a
tall
woman
quietly
dressed
and
not
in
nurses
uniform
her
walk
was
studied
and
her
gestures
exaggerated
she
was
that
hard
blond
type
overladen
with
affectation
to
one
who
observed
carelessly
but
trent
could
see
she
had
a
jaw
like
a
prize
fighter
and
her
carefully
pencilled
eyes
were
intrinsically
bellicose
she
had
a
big
frame
and
was
he
judged
muscularly
strong
and
of
course
nurses
must
have
good
nerves
if
she
had
the
emerald
he
was
determined
to
obtain
it
would
not
be
an
easy
conquest
her
greeting
of
westward
was
effusive
indeed
it
seemed
too
effusive
to
please
him
he
was
courteous
and
expressed
sympathy
she
talked
volubly
she
related
in
detail
the
events
of
the
previous
night
and
the
listener
noticed
that
she
was
letter
perfect
the
only
new
angle
he
got
was
a
description
of
the
supposed
murderer
according
to
nurse
thompson
he
was
about
fifty
wore
a
short
grizzled
moustache
was
of
medium
height
but
very
broad
and
dressed
in
a
dark
gray
suit
in
accent
she
judged
him
to
be
a
westerner
she
would
recognize
him
she
declared
dramatically
among
ten
million
trent
had
no
wish
to
meet
her
yet
he
had
seen
her
recognized
a
predacious
and
formidable
type
and
had
observed
she
wore
expensive
shoes
with
fashionably
high
heels
presently
charles
westward
joined
him
i
ve
been
talking
to
miss
thompson
he
volunteered
i
saw
you
trent
said
but
supposed
it
was
one
of
the
family
she
wasn
t
dressed
as
a
she
doesn
t
act
like
one
westward
answered
richmond
was
right
that
woman
drinks
i
don
t
like
her
i
suppose
she
needs
sympathy
now
that
her
position
is
lost
the
more
anthony
trent
thought
over
the
matter
the
more
thoroughly
he
became
convinced
that
the
mysterious
stranger
of
whom
the
nurse
spoke
had
no
existence
if
she
had
killed
her
employer
she
would
not
have
done
so
unless
it
were
to
her
advantage
and
what
better
reason
could
there
be
were
she
criminally
minded
than
some
of
his
famous
jewels
trent
determined
to
follow
the
thing
up
he
chuckled
to
think
that
he
was
now
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fence
the
hunter
instead
of
the
hunted
but
that
was
no
reason
that
he
should
aid
his
enemy
the
law
if
he
devoted
his
talents
to
the
running
down
of
the
murderer
he
wanted
the
reward
for
himself
supposing
that
she
had
planned
the
crime
the
opportunity
was
hers
when
she
had
the
old
man
alone
in
the
house
she
would
have
been
far
too
clever
to
use
her
knowledge
of
drugs
to
poison
him
by
such
a
ruse
she
would
inevitably
have
incurred
suspicion
if
his
assumption
were
correct
she
had
been
very
clever
at
eight
o
clock
she
had
started
the
ball
rolling
at
nine
she
had
strengthened
her
position
by
some
acting
clever
enough
to
deceive
westward
and
when
they
had
reached
her
primed
by
her
story
of
the
threatening
stranger
they
had
found
her
waiting
hysterically
for
their
aid
no
doubt
she
had
been
drinking
most
women
hate
using
firearms
for
violent
purposes
unless
the
act
is
one
of
suddenly
inspired
fury
when
the
deed
almost
synchronizes
with
the
impelling
thought
she
had
planned
the
thing
carefully
she
had
if
his
theory
held
probably
shot
the
old
man
as
he
sat
reading
then
she
had
locked
and
barred
the
great
doors
and
lowered
herself
to
the
ground
and
entered
by
the
garage
door
which
she
could
have
opened
from
above
thus
the
men
coming
to
her
aid
found
a
scene
prepared
which
her
ingenuity
had
led
them
to
expect
as
entirely
reasonable
by
the
way
he
demanded
suddenly
how
long
was
the
doctor
or
coroner
in
getting
to
apthorpe
he
didn
t
get
there
until
midnight
his
motor
broke
it
was
thus
impossible
to
fix
accurately
the
time
of
apthorpe
s
death
as
they
turned
from
the
drive
into
groton
s
main
street
a
big
limousine
passed
them
to
its
occupants
westward
raised
his
hat
mrs
apthorpe
he
explained
her
daughter
and
hugh
fanwood
the
other
man
was
wilkinson
the
lawyer
who
acts
for
he
paused
as
another
car
turned
into
the
drive
look
like
detectives
he
commented
we
are
well
out
of
that
night
anthony
trent
went
back
to
new
york
hours
later
his
fast
runabout
drew
up
at
the
westward
s
hospitable
home
i
brought
my
car
over
from
boston
he
explained
untruthfully
on
my
way
back
to
new
york
by
way
of
the
berkshires
and
dropped
in
to
see
if
there
was
any
news
in
the
apthorpe
murder
case
the
boston
papers
had
very
little
i
didn
t
already
he
learned
a
great
deal
that
interested
him
first
that
nurse
thompson
had
been
left
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
the
apthorpe
will
this
on
the
advice
of
counsel
would
not
be
contested
as
the
widow
desired
on
the
ground
of
undue
influence
her
daughter
hugh
fanwood
was
not
desirous
of
publicity
secondly
one
of
the
most
famous
jewels
in
the
world
had
been
stolen
imagine
it
westward
exclaimed
for
five
years
an
emerald
that
was
once
in
a
tsarina
s
crown
has
been
within
a
mile
of
us
and
not
a
soul
in
groton
knew
of
it
it
was
worth
a
fortune
we
know
why
the
poor
man
was
done
to
have
they
any
clue
he
demanded
they
have
offered
a
reward
of
ten
thousand
dollars
miss
thompson
s
description
of
the
man
has
been
circulated
widely
and
caused
arrests
in
every
town
in
the
state
the
house
is
being
searched
by
a
detective
agency
but
we
all
believe
it
s
useless
i
don
t
think
amelia
apthorpe
behaved
at
all
well
she
insisted
on
having
everybody
searched
who
was
in
the
house
not
charles
of
course
but
every
one
she
didn
t
know
and
some
whom
she
i
was
in
the
house
trent
reminded
them
perhaps
i
ought
to
offer
no
no
westward
exclaimed
i
told
apthorpe
who
you
were
i
said
you
bought
the
stanley
camp
on
kennebago
and
that
i
could
vouch
for
that
s
mighty
nice
of
you
trent
responded
warmly
it
was
at
a
moment
like
this
when
he
realized
he
was
deceiving
a
good
sportsman
that
he
hated
the
life
he
had
chosen
it
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
he
denied
himself
friends
did
she
have
any
sort
of
scrap
with
miss
thompson
it
s
too
mild
a
word
said
westward
after
the
nurse
s
things
were
searched
she
was
told
to
go
then
she
said
she
should
bring
an
action
against
apthorpe
for
defamation
of
character
and
illegal
search
she
promised
that
there
would
be
enough
scandal
unearthed
to
satisfy
even
the
yellow
press
i
don
t
suppose
poor
amelia
apthorpe
knew
there
were
such
lurid
words
in
or
out
of
the
dictionary
until
the
thompson
woman
flung
them
at
will
she
bring
action
do
you
think
i
think
she
s
too
shrewd
from
what
hugh
fanwood
told
me
they
had
looked
up
her
record
and
found
it
shady
she
a
graduate
nurse
once
her
diploma
is
genuine
and
the
doctor
here
tells
me
she
knew
her
business
but
there
are
other
things
that
she
wouldn
t
want
in
print
i
think
we
ve
seen
the
last
of
her
she
ll
get
her
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
when
she
s
gone
through
that
she
ll
find
some
other
old
fool
to
fall
for
so
far
trent
s
conjecture
as
to
her
character
had
been
accurate
the
death
of
apthorpe
meant
a
large
sum
of
money
to
her
while
the
legacy
remained
unrevoked
he
could
not
marry
her
since
he
was
not
divorced
from
his
wife
perhaps
he
had
believed
in
her
sufficiently
to
show
her
his
peerless
emerald
or
perhaps
he
had
only
hinted
at
its
glories
and
she
had
become
possessed
of
the
secret
of
its
whereabouts
in
any
case
anthony
trent
firmly
believed
she
had
it
it
was
quite
likely
that
she
had
secreted
it
somewhere
in
the
grounds
of
the
mansion
to
retrieve
it
without
risk
later
on
what
woman
except
nurse
thompson
would
have
lowered
herself
from
the
room
to
the
turf
below
on
the
night
of
the
murder
and
was
it
not
likely
that
the
emerald
was
the
cause
of
the
tragedy
the
whole
history
of
precious
stones
could
be
written
in
blood
in
any
case
it
was
a
working
hypothesis
sound
enough
for
trent
to
have
faith
in
in
accordance
with
the
advice
of
lawyers
and
relatives
andrew
apthorpe
decided
to
place
no
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
departure
of
nurse
thompson
she
told
westward
she
was
certain
the
woman
had
taken
the
diamond
ring
she
flaunted
and
that
it
had
not
been
a
gift
as
she
claimed
from
her
employer
furthermore
it
was
evident
that
she
had
made
a
good
deal
of
money
in
padding
the
household
expenses
detectives
meanwhile
clinging
faithfully
to
the
description
so
generously
amplified
by
miss
thompson
of
the
thief
in
the
night
were
hunting
everywhere
for
him
and
his
loot
the
groton
supplied
anthony
trent
with
some
much
needed
information
it
printed
in
its
social
columns
the
news
that
miss
norah
thompson
was
to
make
an
extended
stay
in
the
west
making
her
first
long
stop
at
san
francisco
until
then
she
was
staying
with
a
married
sister
in
east
boston
since
the
name
was
given
in
full
anthony
trent
had
little
difficulty
in
finding
what
he
needed
an
operative
from
a
boston
detective
agency
gleaned
the
facts
while
trent
made
a
pleasant
stay
at
the
touraine
to
the
operative
he
was
a
graham
maltby
of
chicago
when
he
went
west
on
the
same
train
as
the
now
resplendent
miss
norah
thompson
he
was
possessed
of
a
vast
amount
of
information
concerning
her
in
louis
six
years
before
she
had
badly
beaten
a
man
whom
she
declared
had
broken
his
engagement
to
marry
her
she
was
a
singularly
violent
disposition
and
had
figured
in
half
a
dozen
cases
which
wound
up
in
police
courts
chapter
xxii
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
it
was
not
a
matter
of
much
difficulty
for
trent
still
maltby
to
become
acquainted
with
male
members
of
the
set
in
san
francisco
which
miss
thompson
affected
he
knew
that
she
dined
each
night
at
a
café
which
attracted
many
motion
picture
people
and
he
learned
that
there
was
a
producer
from
los
angeles
now
looking
for
easy
money
in
san
francisco
who
was
very
friendly
with
her
since
this
man
weiller
was
easy
of
approach
to
such
as
seemed
prosperous
it
was
not
difficult
for
trent
to
strike
up
an
acquaintance
one
day
at
the
st
charles
weiller
first
of
all
as
became
a
loyal
native
son
spoke
of
climate
then
with
even
greater
enthusiasm
he
spoke
of
the
movies
as
he
wanted
to
get
a
little
money
together
put
on
a
feature
and
sell
it
he
arranged
all
the
details
on
the
back
of
a
charles
menu
card
he
had
an
idea
which
if
william
reynard
of
new
york
could
learn
of
it
would
bring
that
eminent
producer
of
features
a
cool
million
anthony
trent
hung
back
with
the
lack
of
interest
a
man
with
money
to
invest
may
properly
exhibit
weiller
was
sure
he
had
money
he
lived
at
a
first
class
hotel
he
dined
well
and
he
was
a
dresser
to
be
admired
also
weiller
had
seen
a
sizeable
roll
of
bills
on
occasion
there
came
a
night
when
at
anthony
trent
s
expense
miss
norah
thompson
weiller
and
a
svelte
girl
called
by
weiller
california
s
leading
anjenou
partook
of
a
sumptuous
repast
had
it
not
been
that
trent
was
out
for
business
the
whole
thing
would
have
disgusted
him
weiller
and
norah
were
blatantly
vulgar
and
intent
on
impressing
their
host
the
anjenou
said
a
hundred
times
that
he
was
like
one
of
her
dearest
gentlemen
friends
now
being
featured
by
the
jewbird
film
company
her
friend
was
handsome
but
she
liked
anthony
s
nose
better
with
coffee
came
the
great
scheme
weiller
wanted
to
make
a
five
reel
feature
of
the
andrew
apthorpe
murder
norah
thompson
was
to
play
the
lead
it
ll
knock
em
dead
cried
weiller
gee
what
press
agent
stuff
he
helped
himself
with
a
hand
trembling
from
excitement
to
another
gulp
of
wine
my
boy
you
re
in
luck
we
ll
go
into
this
thing
on
equal
shares
i

putting
up
fifty
thousand
dollars

you
shall
put
up
a
like
sum
we
ll
clear
up

trent
demanded
that

what
i
capitalize
my
knowledge
of
pictures
at
weiller
explained
george
is
one
of
the
best
known
producers
in
the
game
miss
thompson
said
a
trifle
nettled
at
what
she
thought
was
a
smile
of
contempt
on
the
other
s
face
he
don
t
need
your
money
i

got
enough
in
this
bag
right
here
to

she
waived
a
black
moiré
bag
before
trent
s
eyes
george
weiller
looked
at
her
and
frowned
what
a
foolish
project
he
thought
to
spend
one
s
own
money
when
here
was
a
victim
you
keep
that
little
one
he
said
generously
we
re
gentlemen
we
don
t
want
to
take
a
lady
s
money
we
ll
talk
it
over
a
keen
salesman
he
noted
trent
was
growing
restive
if
the
matter
were
persisted
in
he
might
either
take
a
fright
or
take
offence
all
this
he
explained
later
you
see
norah
he
remarked
that
guy
has
a
chin
on
him
that
means
you
can
t
drive
he
s
got
a
cold
nasty
eye
said
norah
who
was
not
without
her
just
fears
of
strangers
i
m
going
to
play
the
game
so
he
ll
beg
me
to
let
him
in
on
it
weiller
boasted
i
know
the
way
to
play
that
sort
of
the
negotiations
resulted
in
trent
s
seeing
a
great
deal
more
of
this
precious
couple
than
he
cared
for
the
anjenou
finding
her
charms
made
no
impression
on
him
was
rarely
included
in
the
little
dinners
and
excursions
it
was
when
trent
had
met
miss
thompson
a
dozen
times
that
he
consulted
the
notes
he
had
made
on
each
occasion
it
was
a
method
of
working
unique
so
far
as
he
could
learn
it
might
yield
no
results
in
a
thousand
cases
in
the
thousand
and
first
it
might
be
the
clue
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
list
of
the
costumes
he
had
seen
the
wear
on
going
through
the
list
he
saw
that
whereas
miss
thompson
had
worn
a
new
dress
on
each
occasion
of
the
dinners
in
public
restaurants
with
shoes
and
hosiery
to
harmonize
or
match
the
color
scheme
of
her
gown
she
had
always
carried
the
black
moiré
bag
and
since
it
was
a
fashion
of
the
moment
for
women
to
own
many
and
elaborate
bags
of
this
sort
to
match
or
harmonize
with
the
color
scheme
or
details
of
their
costumes
it
seemed
odd
that
norah
thompson
who
had
been
buying
everything
that
seemed
modish
should
fail
to
follow
the
way
of
the
well
dressed
the
bag
as
he
remembered
it
was
about
seven
inches
wide
and
perhaps
ten
inches
long
it
was
closed
by
a
silver
buckle
and
a
pendant
of
some
sort
swung
at
each
corner
concentrating
upon
it
he
remembered
they
were
not
beads
but
made
of
the
same
material
as
the
bag
itself
and
in
size
about
that
of
an
english
walnut
he
called
to
mind
the
fact
that
he
had
never
seen
her
without
this
bag
why
should
she
cling
so
closely
to
what
was
already
demodé
were
he
a
genuine
detective
the
problem
had
been
an
easy
one
he
could
seize
the
bag
search
it
and
denounce
her
but
that
would
entail
giving
up
a
priceless
stone
for
a
few
thousand
dollars
of
reward
on
the
pretext
of
having
to
buy
a
present
for
a
chicago
cousin
anthony
trent
led
the
willing
weiller
into
one
of
the
city
s
exclusive
department
stores
weiller
was
anxious
to
do
anything
and
everything
for
his
new
friend
that
night
he
norah
and
some
other
friends
were
to
be
trent
s
guests
at
a
very
recherché
dinner
he
felt
as
the
born
salesman
senses
these
things
that
he
would
get
his
answer
that
night
and
that
it
would
be
favorable
and
with
fifty
thousand
dollars
to
play
with
he
might
do
anything
probably
the
last
project
would
be
to
make
a
picture
himself
trent
asked
to
be
shown
the
very
latest
thing
in
bags
the
counter
was
presently
laden
with
what
the
salesgirl
claimed
to
be
direct
importations
from
paris
trent
selected
one
which
he
said
would
suit
his
cousin
you
ought
to
get
one
for
norah
he
said
what
color
is
she
going
to
wear
light
blue
weiller
returned
almost
sulkily
he
had
been
with
her
when
she
purchased
the
gown
and
resented
the
extravagance
if
she
went
on
at
that
rate
there
would
be
nothing
left
for
him
what
they
call
gentian
the
salesgirl
picked
out
an
exquisite
blue
bag
on
which
the
lilies
of
france
had
been
painted
daintily
by
hand
it
was
further
decorated
with
a
border
of
in
seed
pearls
this
is
the
biggest
bargain
we
have
the
girl
assured
them
the
government
won
t
allow
any
more
to
be
brought
over
it
s
marked
down
to
a
hundred
she
looked
at
george
weiller
will
you
take
it
i
m
not
sure
it
s
the
shade
my
friend
wants
he
prevaricated
in
reality
he
cursed
trent
for
dragging
him
into
a
proposition
which
could
cost
such
a
sum
he
had
not
a
tenth
of
the
amount
upon
him
i
ll
take
it
trent
said
carelessly
pushing
a
hundred
dollar
bill
over
the
counter
i
ve
plenty
of
cousins
and
girls
always
like
these
weiller
sighed
enviously
he
often
remarked
if
he
could
capitalize
his
brains
he
would
pay
an
income
tax
of
a
million
dollars
but
that
did
not
prevent
him
from
being
invariably
short
of
ready
money
he
was
looking
forward
to
the
dinner
trent
was
to
give
him
and
his
friends
that
night
besides
norah
there
were
five
other
moving
picture
people
who
were
to
be
used
to
impress
trent
with
their
knowledge
of
the
game
and
the
money
he
could
make
out
of
it
they
would
be
amply
repaid
by
the
dinner
for
there
are
those
who
serve
the
screened
drama
whose
salaries
are
small
these
ancilliary
salesmen
and
women
were
to
meet
at
half
past
six
in
the
furnished
flat
norah
thompson
had
rented
there
they
were
to
be
drilled
it
was
while
they
were
receiving
the
finishing
touches
that
anthony
trent
knocked
upon
the
door
blandly
announcing
that
he
had
brought
an
automobile
to
take
norah
and
george
to
the
hotel
where
he
was
staying
instantly
the
gathering
registered
impatience
to
start
weiller
always
suspicious
feared
that
trent
might
think
it
curious
that
so
many
were
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
and
he
wondered
if
their
voices
had
carried
to
the
hall
where
trent
had
waited
suave
and
courteous
trent
made
himself
at
home
among
the
crowd
of
people
who
were
so
they
informed
him
world
famous
in
a
screen
sense
trent
as
usual
had
timed
things
accurately
it
was
part
of
his
scheme
that
norah
should
want
to
banish
from
his
mind
the
idea
that
there
had
been
any
collusion
she
was
bright
and
vivacious
in
her
manner
toward
him
you
are
a
sweet
man
she
exclaimed
i
m
dreadfully
hungry
and
thirsty
come
on
boys
and
he
noticed
that
although
arrayed
in
a
new
costume
of
blue
she
clung
to
her
back
moiré
bag
he
called
weiller
aside
while
norah
mixed
a
last
cocktail
for
the
men
george
he
whispered
that
blue
bag
i
bought
is
just
the
thing
to
give
george
felt
a
parcel
thrust
into
his
hand
it
s
a
little
present
from
me
to
you
and
she
mustn
t
know
i
bought
she
shan
t
from
me
weiller
said
almost
tremulously
nothing
could
have
happened
more
delightfully
not
ten
minutes
ago
in
the
presence
of
his
even
less
prosperous
motion
picture
colleagues
norah
had
called
him
a
tightwad
who
didn
t
think
enough
of
the
woman
he
was
to
marry
to
buy
her
a
ring
he
explained
that
easily
enough
by
saying
nothing
in
san
francisco
was
good
enough
for
her
and
that
he
was
ordering
one
from
new
york
this
present
from
a
rich
and
careless
spender
would
prove
affluence
no
less
than
affection
thanks
old
man
a
million
norah
was
at
the
door
when
he
presented
it
she
was
genuinely
affected
by
the
gift
perhaps
her
thanks
were
even
warmer
when
one
of
her
friends
picked
up
the
sales
slip
which
had
fluttered
to
the
ground
and
read
aloud
the
price
i
m
tired
of
that
black
bag
george
complained
norah
s
never
going
to
carry
that
when
she
s
got
this
one
of
the
other
women
cried
it
matches
her
gown
i
took
care
of
that
george
said
complacently
i
told
the
saleswoman
to
get
me
the
best
she
had
but
it
must
be
gentian
there
seemed
a
momentary
hesitation
before
the
black
bag
was
discarded
to
cling
to
it
at
such
a
moment
would
be
to
court
suspicion
this
was
trent
s
strategy
her
manner
was
not
lost
upon
one
of
the
others
a
character
woman
named
richards
why
george
she
laughed
i
believe
a
former
lover
gave
norah
that
bag
and
she
hates
to
part
with
it
i
was
in
a
picture
once
where
the
heroine
carried
the
ashes
of
her
first
sweetheart
around
with
her
i
d
look
into
it
if
i
was
nonchalantly
norah
emptied
the
contents
of
the
black
bag
into
the
new
one
then
she
pitched
the
old
one
onto
a
chair
now
for
the
eats
she
said
cheerily
chapter
xxiii
the
secret
of
the
black
bag
the
dinner
was
a
wearisome
affair
to
trent
his
companions
were
vulgar
their
conversation
tedious
and
the
flattery
they
offered
him
nauseous
it
was
exactly
nine
when
a
waiter
came
to
his
side
and
told
him
there
was
a
long
distance
call
for
him
from
denver
apologizing
he
left
the
table
his
brother
is
a
mining
man
out
in
colorado
weiller
informed
the
company
they
re
a
rich
bunch
the
chicago
they
can
t
come
too
rich
for
us
one
of
his
friends
chuckled
pass
me
the
wine
this
is
a
great
little
opportunity
for
rehearsing
weiller
reminded
them
i
ve
got
to
sign
this
bird
up
if
i
do
we
ll
have
another
little
dinner
on
saturday
with
a
souvenir
beside
each
directly
trent
reached
the
hotel
lobby
he
slipped
the
waiter
a
five
dollar
bill
if
they
get
impatient
he
cautioned
the
man
say
i
m
still
busy
on
the
long
distance
and
must
not
be
five
minutes
later
he
opened
the
door
of
norah
s
flat
and
turned
on
the
light
there
upon
a
chair
was
the
bag
on
which
he
had
built
so
many
hopes
his
long
sensitive
fingers
felt
each
of
the
pendants
then
with
the
small
blade
of
a
pocket
knife
he
cut
a
few
stitches
and
drew
out
the
takowaja
emerald
for
a
full
minute
he
gazed
at
its
green
glittering
glory
then
from
a
waistcoat
pocket
he
took
the
brilliant
which
had
been
purchased
with
the
benares
lamp
they
were
much
of
a
size
and
he
placed
the
glass
where
the
jewel
had
been
and
with
a
needle
of
black
silk
already
prepared
sewed
up
the
cut
stitches
the
whole
time
occupied
from
entering
the
apartment
to
leaving
it
was
not
five
minutes
he
was
back
with
his
guests
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
you
must
have
had
good
news
norah
exclaimed
when
he
took
his
seat
his
face
which
had
been
expressionless
before
was
now
lighted
up
he
was
a
new
man
vivacious
witty
and
bubbling
over
with
fun
i
had
very
good
news
he
smiled
i
put
through
a
deal
which
means
a
whole
lot
to
me
let
s
have
some
more
wine
to
the
dinner
was
taking
place
in
a
private
room
and
he
had
insisted
that
the
service
be
of
the
best
now
he
was
free
from
the
tension
that
inevitably
preceded
one
of
his
adventures
he
could
enjoy
himself
for
the
first
time
he
looked
at
the
omnibus
by
the
door
behind
him
it
was
not
the
youthful
fledgling
waiter
he
expected
to
see
but
a
big
dark
man
with
a
black
moustache
and
imperial
norah
observed
his
glance
george
offered
to
star
him
as
the
mysterious
count
but
the
poor
wop
don
t
speak
i
ll
bet
he
left
spaghetti
land
because
he
done
a
murder
george
commented
a
nasty
looking
rummy
i
call
i
ll
swear
he
wasn
t
here
when
i
went
to
the
phone
said
trent
i
should
have
noticed
none
heard
him
the
new
bottle
demanded
attention
there
was
something
vaguely
familiar
about
the
face
but
for
the
life
of
him
trent
could
not
place
it
uneasily
he
was
aware
that
the
man
of
whom
this
strange
waiter
reminded
him
had
come
at
a
moment
of
danger
the
more
he
looked
the
more
certain
he
was
that
imperial
and
moustache
were
the
disguising
features
but
it
is
not
easy
to
strip
such
appendages
off
in
the
mind
s
eye
and
see
clearly
what
lies
beneath
but
there
was
a
way
to
do
so
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
trent
sketched
the
waiter
as
he
appeared
it
was
a
good
likeness
then
with
the
rubber
on
his
pencil
end
he
erased
moustache
and
imperial
the
face
staring
at
him
now
was
beyond
a
question
that
of
devlin
the
man
who
had
run
foul
of
him
over
the
case
of
the
mount
aubyn
ruby
he
remembered
now
that
devlin
had
left
jerome
dangerfield
s
employ
to
join
a
new
york
detective
agency
what
was
devlin
doing
here
disguised
as
a
waiter
if
not
on
his
trail
and
pressed
against
his
side
was
a
stone
of
world
fame
there
was
no
possibility
of
escape
the
dining
room
was
twenty
feet
from
the
street
below
and
he
had
no
way
of
reaching
it
the
door
was
guarded
by
devlin
and
outside
in
the
corridor
waiters
flitted
to
and
fro
old
sir
richard
caught
at
he
was
roused
from
his
eager
scheming
by
a
waiter
asking
what
liqueur
he
would
have
automatically
he
ordered
the
only
liqueur
he
liked
green
chartreuse
would
devlin
allow
the
party
to
break
up
if
so
he
had
a
place
of
safety
already
prepared
for
the
emerald
but
if
arrest
and
search
were
to
take
place
before
he
could
reach
his
room
there
was
no
help
he
would
be
lucky
to
get
off
with
fifteen
years
something
told
him
that
devlin
was
about
to
act
waiters
were
now
grouped
about
the
door
he
knew
that
devlin
must
long
ago
have
marked
him
down
and
this
was
the
final
scene
and
yet
oddly
enough
when
suddenly
the
door
closed
and
a
truculent
detective
advanced
to
the
table
tearing
off
moustache
and
imperial
anthony
trent
who
had
not
left
his
seat
had
no
longer
the
incriminating
stone
upon
him
he
felt
in
fact
reasonably
secure
quiet
youze
devlin
shouted
and
flashed
a
badge
at
them
five
of
the
eight
felt
certain
he
had
come
for
them
weiller
owed
much
money
in
the
vicinity
of
fort
lee
new
jersey
and
was
never
secure
and
more
than
that
he
had
passed
many
opprobrious
remarks
concerning
the
waiter
whom
he
supposed
did
not
understand
him
i
m
employed
said
devlin
to
recover
the
emerald
stolen
from
the
home
of
the
late
andrew
apthorpe
of
groton
massachusetts
on
the
third
of
last
month
and
you
can
be
searched
here
or
in
the
station
it
s
an
outrage
exclaimed
miss
richards
the
character
woman
sure
it
is
devlin
agreed
cynically
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
a
woman
operative
was
introduced
who
took
the
ladies
of
the
party
into
an
adjoining
room
for
search
the
emerald
was
not
found
the
search
revealed
merely
that
miss
richards
had
been
souvenir
hunting
and
her
spoils
were
a
knife
spoon
and
olive
fork
the
men
had
passed
the
ordeal
successfully
that
they
had
made
the
most
of
their
host
s
temporary
absence
the
pockets
full
of
cigars
cigarettes
and
salted
almonds
testified
anthony
trent
seemed
hugely
amused
at
the
procedure
alone
of
them
he
did
not
breathe
suits
for
defamation
of
character
and
the
like
i
have
rooms
here
he
reminded
devlin
by
all
means
search
i
have
snapped
the
other
showing
his
teeth
i
regret
i
didn
t
bring
my
golf
clubs
trent
taunted
him
i
hope
i
ll
put
you
in
a
place
where
they
don
t
play
golf
devlin
cried
angrily
i
m
wise
to
it
s
good
he
s
wise
to
something
shouted
miss
richards
isn
t
it
trent
returned
equably
i
ve
had
no
experience
of
it
so
he
resumed
his
seat
and
beckoned
a
waiter
some
more
coffee
sit
down
ladies
the
ordeal
is
not

devlin
s

half
an
hour
later
the
stone
reposing
in
a
tin
box
of
cigarettes
was
in
the
mails
on
the
way
to
trent
s
camp
at
kennebago
kinney
had
instructions
to
hold
all
mail
and
its
safety
was
thus
assured
there
was
nothing
more
to
fear
he
wanted
very
much
to
know
what
had
happened
at
miss
thompson
s
apartment
and
proposed
to
call
after
breakfast
but
devlin
called
first
upon
him
it
was
a
depressed
devlin
not
indeed
a
devlin
come
to
be
apologetic
but
one
less
assured
well
said
trent
affably
come
to
search
me
again
i
m
getting
a
little
tired
of
it
my
good
i
want
to
know
why
you
pass
here
under
the
name
of
maltby
of
chicago
when
your
name
is
trent
and
you
live
in
new
york
a
private
detective
has
no
right
to
demand
any
such
knowledge
last
night
you
took
upon
yourself
powers
and
authority
which
we
could
have
resisted
if
we
chose
you
had
no
legal
right
to
search
us
i
submitted
first
because
i
had
nothing
to
fear
and
secondly
to
see
if
the
others
had
the
stone
i
didn
t
think
they
what
do
you
know
about
the
stone
devlin
demanded
suspiciously
everything
except
just
where
it
is
at
this
present
moment
between
you
and
me
devlin
i
m
here
after
it
too
i
was
at
groton
as
can
easily
be
proved
on
the
day
after
the
trent
smiled
as
a
curious
look
passed
over
the
detective
s
face
i
m
going
to
disappoint
you
i
passed
the
day
and
night
in
boston
when
the
murder
was
done
i
have
just
as
much
use
for
that
ten
thousand
dollars
as
you
have
by
the
way
i
suppose
you
got
the
stone
like
hell
i
did
devlin
cried
red
in
the
face
i
got
he
showed
trent
the
piece
of
cut
glass
which
had
hung
in
his
room
for
so
long
glass
that
s
what
it
devlin
leaned
forward
and
looked
hard
into
anthony
trent
s
eyes
you
know
more
about
this
than
you
pretend
it
ain
t
accident
that
brings
you
around
when
two
such
stones
as
dangerfield
s
ruby
and
this
here
emerald
get
stolen
there
s
something
more
to
it
than
that
there
s
something
mighty
queer
about
you
mister
anthony
trent
and
i
m
going
to
see
what
it
trent
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
smiled
it
was
the
tolerant
smile
of
the
superior
it
angered
devlin
his
red
face
grew
redder
still
my
good
devlin
said
trent
stupidity
such
as
yours
may
be
a
good
armor
but
it
is
a
poor
diving
talk
sense
devlin
commanded
if
you
wish
trent
agreed
easily
i
mean
that
you
haven
t
the
mental
equipment
to
live
up
to
your
desires
you
have
the
impertinence
to
think
can
outwit
i
m
your
superior
in
everything
mentally
morally
and
physically
i
can
beat
you
and
in
your
heart
you
know
it
i
think
i
ve
stood
about
as
much
from
you
as
i
care
to
take
from
any
man
for
a
time
you
amused
me
at
sunset
park
you
thought
you
were
being
very
subtle
searching
my
room
with
your
twin
ass
o
brien
but
i
was
laughing
at
you
was
drunk
said
devlin
slowly
that
s
how
gin
takes
me
said
the
other
i
see
the
ludicrous
in
men
and
things
just
listen
to
me
my
past
and
present
bears
investigation
you
looked
me
up
and
you
trent
drew
his
bow
at
a
venture
you
found
that
out
didn
t
you
because
i
couldn
t
find
anything
against
you
doesn
t
prove
you
re
what
you
pretend
devlin
admitted
grudgingly
the
point
i
wish
to
make
is
this
anthony
trent
said
incisively
i
m
tired
of
you
you
bore
me
you
weary
me
you
exasperate
me
i
am
willing
to
overlook
your
blundering
stupidity
this
time
but
if
you
worry
me
again
i
shall
go
after
you
so
hard
you
ll
wish
you
d
never
heard
my
name
i
ve
got
money
and
that
means
influence
you
ve
neither
think
it
over
now
get
devlin
looked
at
him
doubtfully
there
was
a
strong
personal
animus
against
anthony
trent
he
hated
anything
suave
smiling
or
polite
and
when
these
qualities
were
in
conjunction
with
physical
prowess
they
spelled
danger
but
for
the
moment
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
violence
devlin
essayed
a
genial
air
we
all
of
us
make
mistakes
he
admitted
i
m
willing
to
say
it
i
m
sorry
i
ve
gone
wrong
over
this
he
held
out
a
big
short
fingered
hand
what
s
the
use
trent
demanded
you
will
always
be
my
enemy
and
i
never
shake
hands
with
an
enemy
if
i
can
get
out
of
devlin
was
at
a
loss
for
the
moment
it
had
been
his
experience
that
when
he
offered
a
hand
it
was
grasped
gladly
eagerly
there
was
something
in
this
harder
unsmiling
trent
which
impressed
him
against
his
will
they
shake
hands
before
the
last
round
of
a
prize
fight
he
reminded
the
other
man
so
they
do
said
trent
smiling
a
little
and
offered
his
hand
two
weeks
later
he
was
compelled
to
concede
that
devlin
s
pertinacity
sometimes
won
its
reward
devlin
had
always
been
an
advocate
of
the
third
degree
together
with
some
operatives
from
his
agency
he
staged
a
gruesome
drama
into
which
hysterical
and
frightened
the
norah
thompson
was
dragged
under
the
pitiless
of
these
hard
men
she
broke
down
andrew
apthorpe
s
murderer
was
found
but
the
triumph
was
incomplete
she
convinced
them
that
although
the
emerald
had
been
hers
for
a
time
of
its
destination
or
present
ownership
she
had
no
idea
she
went
into
penal
servitude
for
life
with
a
newspaper
notoriety
that
made
the
takowaja
emerald
the
most
famous
stone
in
existence
chapter

on
the
trail
of
the
countess
the
expert
has
usually
a
critical
sense
well
developed
it
was
so
with
anthony
trent
he
read
the
details
of
all
the
crimes
treated
in
the
daily
press
almost
jealously
what
the
police
regarded
as
clever
criminals
were
seldom
such
in
his
eyes
there
were
occasionally
crimes
which
won
his
admiration
but
they
were
few
and
far
between
violence
to
trent
s
mind
was
a
confession
of
incompetency
the
grammar
school
type
of
crime
to
a
university
trained
mind
one
morning
the
papers
were
unusually
full
of
such
examples
of
robberies
with
attendant
assaults
clumsy
work
he
commented
and
then
came
to
a
robbery
in
long
island
of
jewels
whose
aggregate
value
was
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
the
home
of
peter
chalmers
rosewarne
at
the
montauk
point
end
of
long
island
was
the
victimized
abode
all
americans
knew
peter
chalmers
rosewarne
he
was
the
tin
king
enormously
wealthy
splendidly
generous
and
fortune
s
favorite
his
father
had
been
a
cornish
mining
captain
who
had
come
from
huel
basset
to
make
a
million
in
the
united
states
his
son
had
made
ten
millions
his
long
island
place
known
as
michael
s
mount
after
that
estate
in
cornwall
near
where
his
father
had
been
born
was
a
show
place
the
gardens
were
extraordinary
the
house
was
filled
with
treasures
which
only
the
intelligent
rich
may
gather
together
rosewarne
was
a
convivial
soul
in
the
best
sense
of
the
phrase
he
loved
company
and
he
loved
display
and
more
than
all
he
loved
his
wife
on
whom
he
showered
the
beautiful
things
women
adore
abstractors
of
precious
stones
would
gravitate
naturally
to
such
a
home
as
his
anthony
trent
remembered
that
the
rosewarne
strain
of
airedales
was
the
best
the
breed
had
to
show
he
had
read
once
that
rosewarne
turned
his
dogs
loose
at
nights
and
laughed
burglars
to
scorn
and
well
he
might
for
of
all
dogs
the
gods
have
blessed
none
with
such
sense
as
the
airedales
possess
theirs
not
to
bark
indiscriminately
or
bite
their
master
s
friends
theirs
to
reason
why
to
know
instinctively
what
is
hidden
from
the
lesser
breeds
a
dozen
such
dogs
roaming
their
master
s
grounds
their
guardian
instincts
aroused
would
effectually
bar
out
strangers
that
a
robbery
had
been
committed
at
michael
s
mount
spelled
for
trent
an
inside
job
the
papers
told
him
that
a
large
house
party
was
gathered
under
the
hospitable
rosewarne
roof
rosewarne
himself
indignantly
denied
the
possibility
of
his
guests
guilt
the
servants
seemed
equally
satisfactory
sifting
the
news
anthony
trent
learned
that
the
suspected
person
was
a
girl
who
had
been
member
of
a
picnic
party
using
the
rosewarne
grounds
there
was
a
space
of
nearly
ten
acres
which
the
mining
man
had
reserved
for
parties
suitably
recommended
who
made
excursions
from
the
connecticut
side
of
the
sound
here
sunday
schools
passed
blameless
days
and
organized
clambakes
the
party
to
which
the
suspected
girl
belonged
was
a
camp
for
working
girls
situated
on
one
of
the
thimble
islands
nearly
forty
of
them
enjoying
the
privilege
of
the
rosewarne
grounds
had
spent
the
day
there
rosewarne
herself
had
seen
them
depart
into
the
evening
mist
then
she
had
seen
thirty
minutes
later
a
girl
running
to
the
water
s
edge
she
was
dressed
as
were
the
others
of
her
party
with
red
trimmed
middy
blouse
and
red
ribbons
in
her
hair
a
brunette
rather
tall
and
slight
and
awed
when
the
chatelaine
of
the
great
estate
asked
what
was
the
matter
it
seemed
she
had
become
tired
and
had
slept
when
she
awoke
the
boat
was
gone
she
had
not
been
missed
rosewarne
was
not
socially
inept
enough
to
bring
the
simple
girl
to
her
own
sophisticated
dinner
table
instead
the
girl
had
an
ample
meal
in
the
housekeeper
s
room
at
nine
o
clock
a
fast
launch
was
to
be
ready
to
take
her
to
her
camp
it
might
easily
overtake
the
sail
boat
if
the
breezes
died
down
at
the
mechanician
in
charge
of
the
boat
came
excitedly
into
the
house
to
relate
his
unhappy
experiences
the
girl
wrapped
in
motor
coat
was
safely
in
the
boat
when
she
begged
the
man
to
get
her
a
glass
of
water
from
the
boat
house
at
the
dock
it
was
while
he
was
doing
so
that
the
boat
disappeared
he
heard
her
call
to
him
in
fright
and
then
saw
the
boat
one
capable
of
twenty
knots
an
hour
glide
away
with
the
girl
holding
her
hands
out
to
him
supplicatingly
she
had
fooled
with
the
levers
he
averred
and
would
probably
perish
in
consequence
it
was
while
rosewarne
considered
the
matter
of
sending
out
his
yacht
in
pursuit
that
the
discovery
was
made
that
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
jewels
had
been
taken
the
mechanician
had
been
fooled
of
that
they
were
now
assured
and
the
working
girl
became
a
fleeing
criminal
the
sudden
temptation
through
seeing
sparkling
stones
in
profusion
was
the
result
a
number
of
boats
went
in
pursuit
and
the
ferries
were
watched
but
the
fast
motor
launch
was
not
found
considering
the
case
from
the
evidence
he
had
at
command
trent
was
certain
it
was
no
genuine
member
of
the
working
girls
camp
who
had
done
this
thing
every
move
spoke
of
careful
preparation
some
one
had
chosen
a
moment
to
appear
at
the
mount
when
suspicion
would
be
removed
and
her
coming
seem
logical
and
no
ordinary
person
would
have
been
able
to
drive
a
high
powered
boat
as
she
had
done
another
thing
which
seemed
conclusive
proof
of
his
correctness
was
the
fact
that
the
girl
had
overlooked
this
was
as
the
police
phrased
it
simeon
power
s
pearl
necklace
and
the
diamond
tiara
belonging
to
campbell
glenelg
this
omission
supported
the
police
theory
that
it
was
the
work
of
an
inexperienced
criminal
anthony
trent
chuckled
as
he
read
this
he
also
had
rejected
the
power
s
pearls
and
the
glenelg
tiara
they
had
been
in
his
appraising
hand
were
both
extraordinarily
good
imitations
assuredly
a
timid
working
girl
could
not
be
such
a
judge
of
this
she
was
a
professional
and
a
clever
one
probably
she
had
sunk
the
launch
and
swam
ashore
later
reports
veered
around
to
his
view
the
camp
people
were
highly
indignant
at
being
saddled
with
a
criminal
they
had
counted
noses
before
embarkation
and
none
was
missing
rosewarne
described
the
girl
and
so
did
the
housekeeper
the
latter
remarking
on
the
slightly
foreign
intonation
was
told
by
the
girl
herself
that
she
came
from
new
bedford
where
her
father
was
employed
in
a
textile
mill
belonging
to
dangerfield
like
so
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
mill
town
he
was
of
french
canadian
stock
and
habitually
spoke
french
in
the
home
but
the
housekeeper
who
had
served
the
wealthy
in
england
and
continental
europe
would
have
it
that
this
intruder
come
of
a
higher
social
class
than
new
bedford
mills
afford
interviewing
the
housekeeper
in
the
guise
of
a
branford
newspaper
man
trent
asked
her
a
hundred
questions
and
each
one
of
her
answers
confirmed
the
belief
that
had
grown
in
him
this
clever
woman
was
the
he
felt
certain
of
it
that
slight
intonation
was
hers
the
figure
the
height
the
coloring
and
of
course
the
exact
knowledge
of
what
stones
were
good
and
what
were
not
this
was
another
count
against
her
for
trent
had
marked
michael
s
mount
for
his
hunting
ground
and
now
precautions
against
abstractors
would
be
redoubled
he
felt
almost
certain
that
this
was
the
countess
s
first
exploit
since
her
escape
from
the
hotel
after
the
guestwick
robbery
he
had
followed
the
papers
too
closely
to
miss
any
unusual
crime
a
woman
of
her
breeding
need
never
drop
to
association
with
the
typical
criminal
since
she
was
marooned
in
the
united
states
during
the
war
she
was
of
necessity
cut
off
from
her
favorite
riviera
hunting
grounds
where
then
might
she
meet
the
wealthy
set
if
not
among
the
owners
of
big
estates
on
long
island
trent
felt
it
probable
that
she
was
near
some
such
social
center
as
meadowbrook
or
piping
rock
how
was
he
to
find
her
to
begin
with
he
decided
to
attend
the
mineola
horse
and
dog
show
this
country
fair
held
during
late
september
invariably
attracted
as
he
knew
all
the
elements
of
the
smart
set
not
to
go
there
not
to
be
interested
intelligently
in
horses
hounds
and
dogs
was
a
confession
of
ineligibility
to
the
great
long
island
homes
although
he
entertained
a
bare
hope
of
seeing
her
and
passed
the
first
day
in
disappointment
he
saw
her
almost
directly
he
entered
the
show
grounds
on
the
second
morning
she
looked
very
smart
in
her
riding
habit
her
hair
was
done
in
a
more
severe
coiffure
than
he
had
noticed
before
she
was
talking
to
a
well
known
society
woman
also
in
riding
kit
a
hamilton
buxton
famous
for
her
horses
and
her
loves
but
he
could
not
judge
from
this
whether
or
not
the
countess
was
on
friendly
terms
with
her
or
not
there
is
a
among
those
who
exhibit
horses
or
dogs
which
is
of
the
and
not
the
salon
outside
it
was
possible
hamilton
buxton
might
not
recognize
her
later
on
he
saw
that
both
women
were
riding
in
the
class
for
ladies
hunters
to
be
ridden
side
saddle
by
the
owners
so
the
countess
owned
hunters
now
well
he
expected
something
of
the
sort
from
a
woman
who
had
outwitted
so
astute
a
craftsman
as
himself
in
a
sense
he
was
glad
of
it
it
was
better
to
find
her
in
such
a
set
as
this
when
she
rode
around
the
ring
he
saw
by
the
number
she
bore
that
she
was
a
madame
de
beaulieu
of
old
westbury
she
rode
very
well
there
was
the
stamp
about
her
work
and
she
was
placed
second
to
hamilton
buxton
whose
chestnut
was
of
a
better
type
anthony
trent
went
straightway
to
new
york
he
did
not
want
to
be
seen
yet
he
called
up
a
certain
number
and
made
an
appointment
with
a
moor
this
man
david
moor
was
a
private
detective
without
ambition
and
without
imaginative
talent
it
always
amused
trent
when
he
employed
a
detective
to
find
out
details
that
were
laborious
in
the
gathering
in
some
subtle
manner
trent
had
given
moor
the
impression
that
he
was
a
secret
service
agent
exceedingly
high
in
the
department
moor
he
said
briskly
as
the
small
and
depressed
david
entered
the
room
i
want
to
find
all
about
a
madame
de
beaulieu
who
lives
in
old
westbury
long
island
i
suspect
her
of
being
a
german
spy
find
out
what
other
members
of
the
household
there
are
and
who
calls
whether
they
are
in
society
or
only
trying
to
be
i
want
a
full
and
reliable
report
the
tradesmen
know
a
whole
lot
as
a
rule
and
servants
generally
talk
i
want
to
know
as
soon
as
possible
but
keep
on
the
job
until
you
have
something
he
knew
that
moor
by
reason
of
an
amazingly
large
family
was
always
hard
up
he
handed
him
fifty
dollars
take
this
for
moor
went
from
the
room
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
looked
at
trent
as
a
loving
dog
looks
at
its
master
two
years
before
his
wife
lay
at
the
point
of
death
needing
more
than
anything
a
rest
from
household
worries
and
the
noise
of
her
offspring
trent
sent
her
to
a
sanitarium
and
the
children
to
camps
for
the
whole
of
a
hot
summer
in
his
dull
depressed
fashion
moor
was
always
hoping
that
some
day
he
could
do
something
to
help
this
benefactor
who
waved
his
thanks
aside
the
report
written
in
moor
s
small
clear
writing
entertained
trent
vastly
madame
de
beaulieu
was
a
daughter
of
france
whose
husband
was
fighting
as
an
officer
of
chasseurs
and
had
been
decorated
thrice
many
pictures
adorned
the
house
of
her
hero
she
had
a
french
maid
who
allowed
herself
to
be
very
familiar
with
her
mistress
undoubtedly
she
was
the
aunt
of
the
guestwick
occasion
the
men
of
the
household
were
doubtful
according
to
moor
one
was
madame
s
secretary
an
american
named
edward
conway
who
looked
after
her
properties
and
the
other
an
englishman
captain
monmouth
a
former
officer
of
cavalry
who
had
broken
an
ankle
in
a
steeple
chase
so
the
report
ran
and
was
debarred
from
military
service
he
was
a
cousin
by
marriage
the
servants
asserted
that
he
was
an
amazingly
lucky
player
at
bridge
or
indeed
of
any
card
game
so
much
so
indeed
that
the
neighboring
estate
owners
who
had
been
inclined
to
be
friendly
were
now
stiffly
aloof
the
captain
s
skill
at
dealing
was
uncanny
bills
were
piling
up
against
them
all
it
was
due
largely
to
this
that
moor
was
able
to
get
so
much
information
a
vituperative
tradesman
sets
no
watch
on
his
tongue
conway
the
secretary
confined
his
work
almost
entirely
to
drinking
there
were
many
bitter
wrangles
at
the
table
but
the
english
tongue
was
never
adopted
on
such
occasions
the
part
of
moor
s
screed
which
interested
trent
most
was
that
there
had
been
a
discussion
overheard
by
a
disgruntled
maid
to
take
in
some
wealthy
paying
guest
and
offer
to
get
him
into
long
island
s
hunting
set
it
would
be
worth
a
great
deal
to
an
ambitious
man
to
gain
an
entrée
into
some
of
these
famous
westbury
homes
of
course
the
odd
household
could
probably
not
live
up
to
such
promises
but
its
members
had
done
a
great
deal
for
example
a
sunday
paper
in
its
photogravure
supplement
had
snapped
madame
de
beaulieu
talking
with
hamilton
buxton
and
captain
monmouth
was
there
to
be
seen
chatting
with
wolfston
colman
the
great
polo
player
an
excellent
beginning
astutely
planned
it
was
while
anthony
trent
debated
as
to
whether
he
dare
risk
the
countess
s
recognition
of
him
that
a
wholly
accidental
circumstance
offered
him
the
opportunity
suffering
from
a
slightly
inflamed
neck
he
was
instructed
to
apply
dioxygen
to
the
area
this
he
did
with
such
cheerful
liberality
that
his
shaving
mirror
next
day
showed
him
a
man
with
black
hair
at
the
front
and
a
vivid
blond
at
the
back
the
dioxygen
had
helped
him
to
blondness
as
it
had
helped
a
million
brunettes
of
the
other
sex
for
a
moment
he
was
chagrined
then
he
saw
how
it
might
aid
it
was
his
intention
to
go
back
to
kennebago
for
the
deer
hunting
and
accordingly
he
despatched
kinney
post
haste
she
was
used
to
these
erratic
commands
and
saw
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
in
the
fact
that
he
was
in
a
bath
robe
with
a
turkish
towel
wound
about
his
head
he
was
in
dread
of
becoming
bald
and
was
continually
fussing
with
his
hair
in
a
day
or
so
anthony
trent
was
a
changed
being
his
eyes
had
a
hazel
tint
in
them
which
formed
not
too
startling
a
contrast
to
his
new
blondness
he
was
careful
to
touch
up
his
eyebrows
also
shutting
up
his
flat
he
registered
at
a
newly
built
hotel
as
oscar
lindholm
of
wisconsin
he
would
pass
for
what
we
assume
the
handsome
type
of
scandinavian
to
be
it
was
at
this
hotel
captain
monmouth
stayed
when
he
came
to
indulge
in
what
he
termed
a
flutter
with
the
cards
there
were
still
a
few
houses
in
the
city
where
one
could
be
reasonably
sure
of
quiet
hard
drinking
youths
were
barred
at
these
houses
they
became
quarrelsome
the
men
who
played
were
in
the
main
big
business
men
who
could
win
without
exhuberance
or
lose
without
going
to
the
district
attorney
they
were
invariably
good
players
and
lost
only
to
the
professionals
and
their
tragedy
was
that
they
could
not
tell
a
professional
until
the
game
was
done
captain
monmouth
always
excited
in
players
of
this
type
a
certain
spirit
of
contempt
he
was
so
languid
so
gently
spoken
so
bored
at
things
and
he
consumed
so
much
scotch
whiskey
that
he
seemed
primed
for
sacrifice
but
he
was
never
the
altar
s
victim
he
was
always
so
staggered
at
his
unexpected
good
fortune
that
he
readily
offered
a
revenge
a
servant
had
told
david
moor
that
the
household
was
supported
on
these
earnings
captain
monmouth
stepping
through
the
lounge
on
the
way
to
his
taxi
caught
sight
of
oscar
lindholm
oscar
was
leaning
against
the
bar
rail
talking
loudly
of
the
horse
five
hours
later
oscar
was
still
standing
at
the
bar
and
the
horse
was
still
his
theme
monmouth
was
a
careful
soul
for
all
his
gentle
languors
and
sauntered
into
the
tap
room
and
demanded
an
alexander
cocktail
as
became
a
son
of
wisconsin
oscar
was
free
and
friendly
the
alexander
was
a
new
one
on
him
he
explained
dropping
for
a
moment
themes
equine
monmouth
never
made
the
mistake
of
offering
friendship
to
a
stranger
unless
he
knew
exactly
what
he
was
and
how
he
might
fit
into
the
monmouth
scheme
of
things
he
referred
lindholm
to
the
guardian
of
the
bottles
it
was
the
size
of
the
lindholm
wad
that
decided
captain
monmouth
to
accept
an
invitation
to
a
golden
woodcock
in
the
grill
room
there
it
was
that
lindholm
opened
his
heart
he
wanted
to
follow
hounds
from
the
back
of
a
horse
well
why
don
t
you
my
good
sir
monmouth
replied
languidly
for
a
moment
a
light
of
interest
had
passed
across
the
dark
blue
eyes
of
the
trent
knew
he
was
interested
trent
explained
he
said
that
the
following
of
hounds
near
new
york
was
only
possible
to
one
who
passed
the
social
examination
demanded
by
these
who
controlled
the
hunting
set
you
re
quite
right
monmouth
admitted
for
the
outsider
it
s
i
ll
show
em
oscar
lindholm
returned
chuckling
then
he
took
the
proof
of
an
advertisement
from
the
columns
of
a
great
new
york
daily
and
passed
it
over
to
monmouth
wealthy
westerner
wants
to
share
home
among
hunting
set
of
long
island
private
house
and
right
surroundings
essential
references
and
that
light
passed
over
the
englishman
s
eyes
and
was
succeeded
by
a
look
of
boredom
you
don
t
suppose
do
you
he
asked
that
the
kind
of
people
you
want
to
know
will
admit
a
stranger
from
wisconsin
into
their
family
why
not
the
other
cried
indignantly
isn
t
this
a
free
country
and
ain
t
i
as
good
as
any
other
man
in
wisconsin
undoubtedly
i
can
t
speak
for
westbury
by
the
way
can
you
ride
i
could
ride
your
head
off
lindholm
bragged
yes
said
monmouth
softly
now
that
s
very
interesting
perhaps
we
could
arrange
a
little
match
somewhere
any
time
at
all
trent
returned
he
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
he
had
a
chance
against
monmouth
but
he
could
afford
to
lose
a
little
money
to
him
in
fact
he
was
anxious
for
the
opportunity
you
are
staying
here
monmouth
demanded
trent
pushed
a
visiting
card
toward
him
it
was
newly
done
oscar
lindholm
spartan
athletic
club
madison
yes
i
m
staying
here
he
admitted
are
you
my
home
is
in
westbury
captain
monmouth
replied
then
you
could
get
me
right
in
to
the
set
i
want
impossible
cried
the
other
rising
stiffly
to
his
feet
one
owes
too
much
to
one
s
bull
said
oscar
lindholm
rudely
you
only
owe
yourself
anything
if
i
have
a
lot
of
money
and
you
want
some
of
it
why
consult
your
friends
what
have
they
done
for
you
i
don
t
care
to
discuss
it
captain
monmouth
exclaimed
good
night
he
limped
away
assuredly
he
was
no
simpleton
he
was
not
sure
of
this
blond
lover
of
sport
if
lindholm
were
genuine
in
his
desire
to
break
into
the
sort
of
society
he
aimed
at
he
would
come
back
to
the
attack
if
he
were
not
genuine
it
were
wiser
to
shake
him
off
as
for
trent
he
felt
reasonably
sure
things
would
come
his
way
but
there
was
a
certain
subtlety
about
these
foreign
gentlemen
of
fortune
which
called
for
careful
treading
were
he
once
to
win
his
way
to
the
establishment
of
madame
de
beaulieu
he
would
be
in
dangerous
company
the
man
who
had
just
left
him
was
dangerous
he
sensed
the
countess
already
commanded
his
respect
then
there
was
the
secretary
and
the
woman
who
posed
now
as
a
maid
and
in
the
house
there
might
be
a
treasure
trove
that
would
make
his
wildest
expenditures
justified
looked
at
in
a
cool
and
reasonable
manner
it
was
a
very
dangerous
experiment
for
anthony
trent
to
make
he
would
be
one
against
four
one
man
against
a
gang
of
international
crooks
all
the
more
deadly
because
they
were
suave
and
polished
it
was
while
he
was
breakfasting
that
captain
monmouth
took
a
seat
near
him
trent
commanded
his
waiter
to
transport
his
food
to
monmouth
s
table
what
about
that
horse
race
he
demanded
let
me
see
the
other
murmured
oh
yes
you
say
you
can
ride
i
can
trim
you
up
in
good
style
trent
said
cheerfully
any
old
what
stakes
monmouth
asked
without
eagerness
what
distance
over
the
sticks
or
on
the
flat
stakes
trent
said
as
though
not
understanding
i
never
ride
or
play
cards
for
love
monmouth
told
him
that
can
be
arranged
later
trent
said
the
main
thing
is
where
can
we
pull
it
off
out
west
there
s
a
million
places
but
here
everything
is
private
captain
monmouth
reflected
for
a
moment
i
shall
be
in
town
again
in
three
days
time
you
ll
be
here
depends
what
answers
i
get
to
my
oh
yes
monmouth
returned
they
will
be
very
amusing
very
amusing
why
trent
demanded
because
the
people
who
will
answer
will
not
suit
your
purpose
at
all
there
may
be
many
who
would
be
glad
of
help
in
running
a
house
in
these
hard
times
but
they
dare
not
answer
an
advertisement
like
yours
for
fear
it
might
be
known
and
then
again
think
of
the
risk
of
taking
an
unknown
into
the
home
i
offer
references
trent
reminded
him
but
my
dear
sir
monmouth
protested
what
are
athletic
clubs
in
madison
to
do
with
those
who
have
the
entrée
to
meadowbrook
supposing
trent
said
presently
a
family
such
as
i
want
did
get
into
communication
with
me
how
much
would
they
expect
captain
monmouth
looked
at
him
appraisingly
trent
felt
certain
that
if
a
figure
were
named
it
would
be
the
one
he
would
have
to
pay
for
the
privilege
of
meeting
the
charming
madame
de
beaulieu
one
couldn
t
stay
at
a
decent
hotel
under
two
hundred
and
fifty
a
week
the
cavalryman
returned
you
d
have
to
pay
at
least
five
that
s
a
lot
trent
commented
i
imagined
you
d
think
that
monmouth
said
drily
but
i
could
pay
it
easy
enough
the
retorted
chapter
xxvi
anthony
trent
paying
guest
and
in
the
end
he
did
when
captain
monmouth
suggested
that
the
match
between
the
two
be
ridden
off
on
his
own
grounds
near
westbury
anthony
trent
felt
certain
that
he
was
taken
there
to
be
inspected
by
the
other
members
of
the
household
edward
conway
was
a
taciturn
man
not
inclined
to
be
friendly
with
the
affable
oscar
lindholm
of
the
match
little
need
be
said
trent
a
good
rider
had
engaged
to
beat
a
professional
at
his
own
game
captain
monmouth
was
the
richer
by
a
thousand
dollars
in
the
billiard
room
of
elm
lodge
after
the
race
monmouth
offered
his
guest
some
excellent
scotch
whiskey
and
grew
a
little
more
amiable
i
presume
lindholm
he
said
that
you
would
have
no
objection
to
my
man
of
business
looking
up
your
rating
in
madison
go
as
far
as
you
like
what
you
will
find
will
be
it
is
monmouth
smiled
i
wish
i
had
half
the
money
that
you
have
i
should
consider
myself
rich
enough
and
god
knows
my
tastes
are
not
so
you
had
me
investigated
trent
smiled
a
little
when
when
we
made
this
trent
had
found
that
the
assumption
of
a
name
might
be
dangerous
if
investigations
were
made
concerning
it
it
was
with
his
customary
caution
that
he
had
taken
lindholm
s
name
david
moor
his
little
detective
often
spoke
of
his
cases
to
his
patron
he
had
spoken
at
length
about
the
case
of
oscar
lindholm
of
madison
wisconsin
a
lumber
millionaire
oscar
came
to
new
york
to
have
a
good
time
in
the
traditional
manner
of
wealthy
men
from
far
states
a
joyride
in
which
a
man
was
run
down
figured
prominently
in
his
first
night
s
entertainment
fearing
that
the
notoriety
of
this
would
affect
his
political
aspirations
in
the
west
he
was
sentenced
to
a
month
on
blackwell
s
island
under
an
assumed
name
during
this
month
his
name
could
safely
be
used
the
day
that
trent
became
a
member
of
the
household
at
elm
lodge
the
real
lindholm
had
ten
days
more
to
serve
the
wardrobe
which
trent
had
gathered
about
him
was
utterly
unlike
his
own
perfect
outfit
he
conceived
oscar
lindholm
to
be
without
refinements
and
he
dressed
the
part
he
could
see
captain
monmouth
shudder
as
he
came
into
the
drawing
room
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
lindholm
wore
a
prince
albert
coat
and
wore
it
aggressively
his
patent
leather
shoes
had
those
hideous
knobs
on
them
wherein
a
dozen
toes
might
hide
themselves
my
dear
man
gasped
monmouth
we
dress
for
dinner
what
s
the
matter
with
me
the
indignant
guest
asked
everything
monmouth
cried
you
look
like
an
undertaker
fortunately
we
are
very
much
of
a
size
and
i
have
some
dress
clothes
i
ve
never
worn
if
madame
de
beaulieu
had
seen
you
i
don
t
know
what
would
have
in
ten
minutes
trent
was
back
in
the
drawing
room
this
time
arrayed
as
he
himself
desired
to
be
madame
de
beaulieu
had
not
yet
come
down
madame
is
particular
then
trent
hazarded
she
has
a
right
to
be
monmouth
said
a
little
stiffly
she
belongs
to
one
of
the
great
families
of
trent
watching
him
saw
that
he
believed
it
this
was
a
new
angle
she
had
deceived
monmouth
without
a
doubt
for
the
first
time
and
the
last
trent
observed
a
certain
confusion
about
captain
monmouth
in
confidence
he
said
madame
de
beaulieu
and
i
are
engaged
to
be
married
captain
de
beaulieu
and
she
were
negotiating
for
divorce
when
the
war
broke
out
and
we
must
wait
trent
remembering
moor
s
report
as
to
the
members
of
the
household
pointed
to
edward
conway
sipping
his
third
cocktail
that
s
the
chaperon
eh
madame
de
beaulieu
s
aunt
madame
de
berlaymont
is
here
monmouth
said
affably
it
is
our
custom
to
use
french
at
the
table
as
much
to
starve
the
servants
of
food
for
gossip
as
anything
else
you
speak
french
of
course
not
a
word
trent
lied
promptly
now
if
you
want
to
talk
danish
or
swedish
i
m
with
madame
de
berlaymont
no
doubt
the
french
maid
resuming
the
aunt
pose
at
the
guestwick
affair
she
had
been
an
english
lady
of
fashion
had
they
put
themselves
to
this
bother
simply
for
his
sake
he
doubted
it
we
ve
not
been
here
long
captain
monmouth
went
on
and
we
know
very
few
people
of
course
we
could
easily
know
the
wrong
sort
but
that
s
dangerous
one
of
the
most
popular
and
influential
men
in
the
country
is
captain
monmouth
had
no
time
to
mention
his
name
for
madame
de
beaulieu
came
in
it
was
the
first
time
trent
had
met
her
face
to
face
since
that
night
at
the
guestwick
s
he
was
not
without
a
certain
nervousness
looking
at
himself
in
the
mirror
he
seemed
so
much
the
product
of
peroxide
that
it
must
easily
be
recognized
but
madame
de
beaulieu
gave
him
the
most
cursory
of
glances
there
was
a
certain
nervousness
about
her
and
monmouth
which
had
little
enough
to
do
with
him
this
visit
of
the
influential
neighbor
plainly
was
what
concerned
them
trent
assumed
shrewdly
enough
that
they
were
trying
for
reasons
of
their
own
to
break
into
the
wealthy
hunting
set
and
had
not
found
it
easy
madame
de
beaulieu
was
beautifully
gowned
she
looked
to
be
a
woman
of
thirty
whereas
when
he
had
first
seen
her
she
looked
no
more
than
two
and
twenty
she
carried
herself
splendidly
her
french
accent
was
marked
in
the
police
court
she
spoke
as
the
english
do
when
the
little
bent
but
distinguished
aunt
came
in
he
could
not
recognize
her
at
all
assuredly
he
had
stumbled
upon
as
high
class
band
of
crooks
as
had
ever
bothered
police
he
could
sense
that
they
regarded
him
as
a
necessary
nuisance
whose
five
hundred
dollars
a
week
helped
the
household
expenses
and
he
knew
instinctively
that
captain
monmouth
and
edward
conway
would
plan
to
get
some
of
the
millions
he
was
supposed
to
have
trent
s
swedish
accent
was
copied
faithfully
from
his
janitor
who
had
been
of
a
superior
class
in
his
own
country
before
he
had
fallen
to
furnace
tending
he
did
not
overdo
it
to
those
listening
he
appeared
anxious
to
overcome
his
accent
and
lapsed
into
it
only
occasionally
trent
heard
monmouth
tell
madame
de
beaulieu
that
lindholm
s
dress
was
terrible
and
that
by
god
s
grace
their
measurements
were
identical
or
they
would
have
been
disgraced
by
a
guest
in
a
frock
coat
he
spoke
in
rapid
french
and
in
an
undertone
but
trent
s
ears
were
sharp
and
had
ere
this
warned
him
of
danger
where
another
man
would
have
heard
nothing
the
guest
of
honor
was
no
less
than
conington
warren
he
was
ripely
affable
he
had
come
to
this
dinner
more
to
report
on
the
behavior
of
the
strangers
occupying
elm
lodge
than
anything
else
a
bachelor
may
sit
at
a
table
or
a
divorced
man
where
the
married
man
can
not
go
at
the
mineola
show
madame
de
beaulieu
had
made
a
good
impression
on
the
women
but
they
were
not
sure
of
her
they
had
found
that
captain
monmouth
was
indeed
the
second
son
of
sir
john
monmouth
bart
and
formerly
an
officer
of
lancers
he
had
wasted
his
money
at
the
race
track
and
the
gaming
table
but
then
that
was
not
wholly
frowned
upon
by
the
young
bloods
of
american
society
trent
could
see
that
warren
was
impressed
there
was
an
air
of
breeding
about
his
hostess
and
host
he
had
not
thought
to
see
the
dinner
was
good
enough
to
win
his
distinguished
commendation
he
unbent
so
far
as
to
question
lindholm
about
political
conditions
in
his
native
state
he
congratulated
madame
de
beaulieu
on
the
single
string
of
exquisite
pearls
that
were
about
her
white
throat
and
well
he
might
cartier
had
charged
peter
chalmers
rosewarne
a
pretty
penny
for
them
not
so
long
ago
had
he
but
known
it
he
would
have
been
even
more
interested
in
the
ring
which
oscar
lindholm
wore
it
was
a
plain
gold
band
in
which
a
single
ruby
blazed
he
had
never
worn
it
till
now
he
felt
lindholm
might
easily
allow
himself
the
luxuries
of
which
anthony
trent
was
denied
the
stone
had
adorned
a
stick
pin
which
conington
warren
once
loved
and
lost
monmouth
s
knowledge
of
horses
commended
itself
to
the
owner
of
thoroughbreds
two
men
such
as
these
could
not
play
a
part
where
horses
were
concerned
conington
warren
remembered
seeing
monmouth
win
that
greatest
of
all
steeplechases
the
grand
national
a
was
instantly
established
it
was
a
triumphant
night
undoubtedly
the
household
at
elm
lodge
would
be
accepted
thinking
over
the
situation
in
his
own
room
that
night
trent
admitted
he
was
puzzled
why
this
struggle
for
social
recognition
his
first
theory
that
it
was
in
order
to
rob
wealthy
homes
was
dismissed
as
untenable
to
begin
with
it
was
an
old
trick
and
played
out
directly
an
alien
household
in
a
colony
of
old
friends
attracts
attention
it
also
attracts
suspicion
and
if
this
section
of
westbury
were
to
suffer
an
epidemic
of
burglaries
madame
de
beaulieu
s
home
would
come
under
police
supervision
there
was
little
doubt
in
trent
s
mind
that
this
captain
monmouth
was
a
member
of
the
family
he
claimed
as
his
conington
warren
and
he
had
common
friends
in
england
what
was
his
game
and
yet
madame
de
beaulieu
or
the
countess
had
been
notorious
as
the
leading
member
of
a
gang
of
high
class
crooks
she
had
even
been
fingerprinted
and
had
he
believed
served
a
sentence
not
a
month
before
she
had
taken
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
jewels
from
michael
s
mount
and
an
amount
of
currency
not
specified
as
the
days
went
by
trent
made
other
discoveries
he
found
for
one
thing
that
the
man
whose
name
he
had
taken
had
a
reputation
for
drinking
for
he
found
a
decanter
and
siphon
ever
at
his
elbow
by
degrees
he
and
edward
conway
gravitated
together
this
conway
whose
part
in
the
game
he
could
not
yet
guess
was
drinking
himself
steadily
to
death
one
morning
trent
came
upon
conway
scribbling
on
a
pad
of
paper
he
stared
hard
at
what
he
wrote
and
then
tossed
the
crumpled
paper
into
a
nearby
open
fire
the
day
was
chilly
and
the
blazing
logs
were
cheerful
when
conway
was
gone
trent
retrieved
the
paper
and
saw
the
signature
he
had
assumed
copied
to
a
nicety
conway
probably
had
his
uses
as
a
forger
the
gang
of
the
countess
had
accomplished
notable
successes
by
these
means
trent
had
not
been
an
hour
in
the
house
when
he
discovered
that
monmouth
and
madame
de
beaulieu
had
eyes
only
for
one
another
it
was
a
vulgar
intrigue
trent
supposed
and
explained
the
situation
but
as
day
succeeded
day
he
found
he
was
wrong
here
were
two
people
a
beautiful
woman
accomplished
and
fascinating
and
a
man
of
uncommon
good
looks
and
distinction
head
over
ears
in
love
with
one
another
conceivably
such
people
removed
from
the
conventions
of
society
would
pay
small
attention
to
the
and
yet
he
saw
no
gesture
or
heard
no
word
in
french
or
english
that
was
not
proper
sometimes
he
felt
he
must
have
mistaken
the
aristocratic
madame
de
beaulieu
and
her
empire
aunt
for
the
wrong
women
but
he
could
not
mistake
the
rosewarne
pearls
which
he
had
viewed
in
cartier
s
only
a
week
before
the
mining
man
bought
them
as
a
birthday
present
for
his
wife
the
night
that
monmouth
and
the
woman
he
loved
were
asked
to
a
dinner
party
at
conington
warren
s
home
oscar
lindholm
had
two
more
days
to
serve
on
blackwell
s
island
so
far
anthony
trent
had
accomplished
nothing
he
had
lost
a
thousand
dollars
on
a
horse
race
two
weekly
payments
of
five
hundred
dollars
for
board
and
another
thousand
in
small
amounts
at
auction
and
pool
he
was
most
certainly
a
paying
guest
conway
and
trent
were
not
asked
madame
de
berlaymont
was
indisposed
it
was
the
opportunity
he
had
wanted
it
was
conway
s
habit
to
sleep
from
about
ten
in
the
evening
until
midnight
every
night
since
trent
had
been
at
elm
lodge
the
secretary
had
done
so
in
a
large
wing
chair
with
an
evening
paper
unopened
on
his
knees
he
would
fall
into
sleep
he
could
be
counted
upon
therefore
not
to
interrupt
the
servants
retired
no
later
than
ten
to
their
distant
part
of
the
rambling
house
only
madame
de
berlaymont
might
be
in
the
way
in
reality
this
amiable
chaperone
was
a
woman
in
the
early
twenties
trent
believed
and
could
not
be
counted
upon
to
remain
unmoved
if
she
heard
strange
noises
in
the
night
as
of
burglars
moving
trent
already
knew
the
of
the
house
it
was
just
past
ten
when
the
servants
went
to
bed
and
conway
sunk
in
his
two
hours
slumber
that
oscar
lindholm
went
exploring
stepping
very
carefully
by
madame
de
berlaymont
s
room
he
listened
a
long
while
no
sound
met
his
ears
then
with
a
practiced
skill
he
turned
the
door
knob
and
entered
an
unlighted
room
still
there
was
no
sound
of
breathing
and
when
he
switched
on
the
light
the
apartment
was
empty
the
indisposition
which
had
kept
the
aged
lady
two
days
confined
to
her
chamber
was
plainly
a
ruse
trent
could
return
to
it
later
never
before
had
trent
carried
an
automatic
pistol
and
been
prepared
to
use
it
if
necessary
he
was
now
in
a
house
whose
inmates
were
like
himself
shrewd
resourceful
and
strong
for
all
he
knew
conway
might
long
ago
have
suspected
him
madame
de
beaulieu
and
her
chaperone
occupied
the
bedrooms
of
one
wing
of
the
low
rambling
house
in
the
other
wing
monmouth
lindholm
and
conway
slept
over
this
bachelor
wing
as
it
was
called
were
some
smaller
rooms
where
the
four
maid
servants
slept
the
rooms
of
madame
de
beaulieu
were
beautifully
furnished
it
was
a
suite
with
salon
bedroom
and
a
large
bathroom
trent
determined
to
allow
himself
an
hour
and
a
half
skilled
as
he
was
in
searching
he
felt
he
would
discover
something
in
those
ninety
minutes
but
the
time
had
almost
gone
by
and
he
was
baffled
there
was
nothing
he
probed
and
sounded
and
measured
as
he
had
seen
dangerfield
s
detectives
do
but
nothing
rewarded
him
what
jewels
madame
de
beaulieu
owned
she
had
probably
worn
but
how
dare
she
wear
at
a
dinner
party
where
the
rosewarne
s
might
conceivably
be
so
well
known
a
string
of
pearls
and
what
of
those
other
baubles
which
were
missing
from
michael
s
home
a
carved
ivory
jewel
box
on
her
dressing
table
revealed
only
a
ball
the
size
of
a
golf
ball
made
of
silver
paper
she
had
begged
him
to
save
the
tinsel
in
the
boxes
of
cigarettes
he
smoked
so
that
she
might
bind
this
mass
until
it
became
worthy
of
sending
to
the
red
cross
anthony
trent
balanced
the
silver
sphere
in
his
hand
naturally
it
was
heavy
if
i
he
mused
wanted
to
hide
my
three
beauties
i
couldn
t
think
of
anything
safer
than
this
she
s
clever
too
why
shouldn
t
she
use
it
for
something
she
s
afraid
of
anybody
seeing
a
steel
hat
pin
was
to
his
hand
exerting
a
deal
of
wrist
strength
he
thrust
it
through
the
mass
in
the
middle
it
met
with
a
resistance
that
the
pin
could
not
pierce
it
was
twelve
o
clock
as
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
locked
the
door
of
his
own
room
it
seemed
minutes
before
his
eager
fingers
could
strip
off
piece
after
piece
of
silver
paper
and
then
the
palm
of
his
hand
cupped
one
of
the
most
beautiful
diamonds
he
had
ever
seen
it
was
fully
a
hundred
carats
in
weight
and
its
value
he
could
hardly
approximate
no
stone
of
this
size
had
ever
been
lost
in
the
united
states
he
remembered
however
some
four
years
ago
the
nizam
of
hyderabad
one
of
the
greatest
of
indian
potentates
and
owner
of
an
unparalleled
collection
of
diamonds
had
bought
a
famous
stone
in
london
it
was
never
delivered
to
him
the
messenger
had
been
found
floating
in
the
thames
off
greenhithe
the
reputed
price
of
purchase
had
been
thousand
pounds
the
nizam
s
had
been
a
diamond
and
anthony
trent
believed
he
held
it
in
his
hand
he
thought
of
his
benares
lamp
and
chuckled
if
he
desired
to
avenge
himself
on
madame
de
beaulieu
for
the
loss
of
the
guestwick
money
he
was
amply
rewarded
now
the
blazing
thing
in
his
hand
would
fetch
at
least
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
if
he
dared
dispose
of
it
obviously
the
correct
procedure
for
the
supposed
oscar
lindholm
was
to
make
his
escape
at
once
he
would
have
little
chance
to
do
so
were
the
abstraction
to
become
known
of
course
madame
de
beaulieu
would
look
in
her
ivory
casket
directly
she
came
in
did
he
himself
not
always
glance
anxiously
at
his
lamp
whenever
he
had
been
away
from
it
for
a
few
hours
cautiously
he
made
his
way
down
to
the
hall
where
his
coat
and
hat
were
as
he
passed
the
door
it
opened
and
madame
de
beaulieu
entered
with
monmouth
she
was
pale
so
pale
indeed
that
trent
stopped
to
look
at
her
back
early
aren
t
you
he
asked
madame
has
had
bad
news
said
monmouth
and
looked
at
her
anxiously
she
sank
into
a
big
chair
before
the
open
fire
certainly
she
was
very
beautiful
looking
at
her
it
seemed
incredible
that
she
could
be
one
of
the
best
known
adventuresses
in
the
world
perhaps
after
all
much
of
the
anecdote
that
was
built
about
her
was
legendary
presently
she
spoke
in
french
to
monmouth
bear
with
me
my
dear
one
she
said
but
i
must
see
him
alone
i
am
a
creature
of
premonitions
let
me
have
my
the
look
that
captain
monmouth
bent
upon
anthony
trent
was
not
a
friendly
one
there
was
a
new
quality
of
suspicion
and
antagonism
in
it
madame
de
beaulieu
he
said
stiffly
wants
to
speak
with
you
alone
i
see
no
occasion
for
it
but
her
wish
is
law
i
shall
leave
you
when
they
were
alone
she
did
not
speak
for
some
minutes
then
she
turned
to
him
and
looked
at
him
searchingly
he
felt
the
necessity
of
being
on
his
guard
mr
lindholm
she
said
quietly
i
do
not
understand
why
should
you
bother
to
he
asked
because
i
am
afraid
of
everything
i
do
not
trust
you
say
you
are
a
naturalized
swede
that
would
explain
your
she
leaned
forward
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
mr
lindholm
you
have
made
one
very
silly
mistake
which
no
woman
would
and
that
is
what
he
demanded
you
have
let
your
bleached
hair
get
black
at
the
roots
you
are
a
blackhaired
man
why
deny
it
i
don
t
he
said
i
admit
then
why
are
you
here
captain
monmouth
knows
a
desire
to
break
into
society
if
you
will
you
answer
me
one
question
truthfully
she
asked
on
your
honor
yes
he
said
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
are
you
a
detective
on
my
honor
no
why
should
madame
de
beaulieu
fear
detectives
there
was
a
faint
flush
in
her
cheeks
now
and
a
brighter
color
in
her
eyes
she
was
enormously
relieved
at
his
answer
why
are
you
here
then
if
you
must
know
he
told
her
it
was
for
not
to
harm
captain
monmouth
she
cried
paling
i
came
on
your
account
he
said
quietly
you
don
t
remember
me
she
shook
her
head
when
did
we
meet
in
europe
no
less
a
place
than
fifth
ah
at
some
social
function
one
meets
so
many
that
one
has
no
time
for
recalling
names
or
even
later
i
saw
you
at
a
police
court
you
were
an
indignant
young
accused
of
robbing
guestwick
or
trying
to
you
may
recall
a
man
who
opened
the
guestwick
safe
for
you
a
man
upon
whose
good
nature
you
he
looked
very
somber
and
stern
she
shrank
back
and
covered
her
face
with
her
white
hands
i
knew
happiness
was
not
for
me
she
said
brokenly
i
said
when
i
found
the
man
i
loved
was
the
man
who
loved
me
it
is
too
wonderful
too
beautiful
it
is
not
for
me
i
am
born
under
an
unlucky
and
you
see
i
was
trent
considered
her
for
a
moment
here
was
no
acting
here
was
a
woman
whose
soul
was
in
agony
you
forget
he
said
that
i
don
t
know
what
you
i
had
better
tell
you
she
said
with
a
gesture
of
despair
captain
monmouth
and
i
love
each
other
it
has
awakened
the
good
in
us
that
we
both
thought
was
buried
or
had
never
existed
while
my
husband
captain
de
beaulieu
lived
there
was
no
chance
of
a
divorce
he
is
catholic
after
dinner
one
of
warren
s
guests
brought
a
late
paper
from
new
york
and
i
saw
that
my
husband
was
killed
i
could
stay
there
no
longer
coming
home
in
the
motor
i
asked
myself
whether
it
would
be
my
fate
to
win
happiness
i
doubted
it
even
though
i
repented
in
ashes
then
it
was
i
began
to
think
of
you
the
stranger
whose
money
we
needed
the
stranger
who
reminded
me
vaguely
of
some
day
when
there
was
danger
in
the
air
under
the
light
as
i
came
in
i
saw
your
hair
then
i
knew
that
in
the
hour
of
my
greatest
hope
i
was
to
experience
the
most
bitter
you
forget
madame
he
said
harshly
that
i
have
had
the
benefit
of
your
consummate
acting
and
you
think
i
am
acting
now
why
shouldn
t
i
he
retorted
you
have
everything
to
gain
by
it
i
can
collect
the
guestwick
reward
and
send
you
back
to
i
can
pay
you
more
than
the
ten
thousand
dollars
he
offered
she
cried
quickly
with
the
sale
of
the
rosewarne
jewels
she
shrank
back
ciel
how
could
you
know
i
do
he
said
brusquely
and
that
s
enough
you
see
you
are
trying
to
fool
me
again
you
say
your
love
has
brought
out
the
good
in
you
that
you
didn
t
know
you
possessed
and
yet
a
few
weeks
back
you
are
at
your
old
tricks
again
is
that
reasonable
i
ll
tell
you
everything
she
cried
wildly
you
must
understand
it
was
i
who
took
the
rosewarne
jewels
why
because
i
am
fighting
for
my
happiness
captain
monmouth
knows
nothing
of
what
my
life
has
been
i
have
told
him
that
after
the
war
i
shall
go
back
to
france
and
sell
my
property
and
with
it
help
him
to
buy
a
place
that
was
once
a
seat
of
his
family
there
away
from
the
world
we
shall
live
and
die
i
want
only
him
and
he
wants
only
me
we
have
known
life
and
its
vanities
we
want
happiness
you
hold
it
in
your
hands
if
you
take
your
revenge
by
telling
him
you
break
my
heart
is
that
a
vengeance
which
satisfies
you
monsieur
l
inconnu
if
so
it
is
very
easy
he
is
in
the
next
room
call
him
you
have
only
to
say
captain
monmouth
this
woman
whom
you
love
is
a
notorious
criminal
all
europe
knows
her
as
the
countess
the
money
that
she
wants
to
build
her
house
of
love
with
is
stolen
money
she
will
assuredly
disgrace
your
name
as
she
has
that
of
the
great
family
from
which
she
she
looked
supplicatingly
at
anthony
trent
you
have
only
to
tell
him
that
and
there
is
no
happiness
left
for
me
in
all
the
do
you
think
i
would
do
that
he
demanded
how
can
i
tell
why
should
you
not
i
am
in
your
there
was
no
doubting
the
genuineness
of
her
emotion
formerly
she
had
tricked
him
but
here
was
her
bared
soul
to
see
i
came
here
he
said
slowly
angry
because
you
had
played
upon
my
sympathies
and
outwitted
me
i
schemed
to
gain
an
entrance
to
this
house
for
no
other
reason
i
shall
leave
it
admiring
you
and
monmouth
and
hoping
you
will
be
it
was
as
though
she
could
scarcely
believe
him
then
you
will
not
tell
him
she
exclaimed
you
will
go
without
that
for
which
you
came
she
did
not
understand
his
smile
i
shall
not
tell
him
anthony
trent
declared
as
for
the
rest
we
are
quits
at
the
hour
when
the
real
oscar
lindholm
left
blackwells
island
the
pretender
was
lovingly
setting
the
fourth
jewel
in
the
benares
lamp
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
two
happier
men
in
all
america
that
morning
chapter
xxvii
kinney
makes
a
confession
anthony
trent
looked
about
his
rooms
with
a
certain
merited
affection
in
a
week
he
would
know
them
no
more
already
arrangements
had
been
made
to
send
the
furniture
to
his
camp
on
kennebago
a
great
deal
of
the
furniture
weems
had
gathered
there
was
distressfully
bad
weems
ran
to
gilt
and
brocade
mainly
as
trent
surveyed
his
apartment
it
amused
him
to
think
that
never
was
a
flat
in
a
house
such
as
this
furnished
so
well
and
at
so
great
a
cost
the
things
might
seem
modest
enough
at
first
glance
there
was
for
example
a
steel
engraving
after
stuart
of
george
washington
a
fitting
and
a
worthy
picture
for
any
american
s
room
but
hardly
one
which
required
a
large
amount
of
money
to
obtain
none
save
anthony
trent
knew
that
behind
the
print
was
concealed
one
of
the
most
beautiful
examples
of
that
flower
of
the
venetian
renaissance
giorgione
a
few
months
before
the
scribblers
club
had
invited
motion
picture
magnates
to
its
monthly
dinner
only
a
few
of
these
moulders
of
public
taste
had
accepted
there
were
good
enough
reasons
for
declination
the
subject
incensed
those
who
held
that
writers
had
no
grudge
against
the
others
lacked
ability
in
the
english
tongue
and
there
were
some
producers
who
feared
the
scribblers
fare
might
be
unworthy
one
big
man
consented
to
speak
he
was
glib
with
that
oratory
which
comes
from
successful
selling
before
he
had
sprung
into
notoriety
he
had
been
a
salesman
in
a
seventh
avenue
store
one
of
those
persuasive
gentlemen
who
waylay
passersby
his
speech
was
of
course
absurd
it
was
interesting
mainly
as
an
example
that
intelligence
is
not
always
necessary
in
the
making
of
big
money
it
was
when
he
began
to
speak
of
the
material
rewards
that
his
acumen
had
garnered
that
anthony
trent
awoke
to
interest
the
producer
told
his
hearers
that
they
had
assuredly
read
of
the
sale
to
an
unnamed
purchaser
of
a
giorgione
i
am
that
purchaser
said
the
great
man
i
give
more
money
for
it
than
his
shrewd
appraising
eye
went
around
the
table
he
saw
eager
unsuccessful
writers
starveling
associate
editors
and
a
motley
company
of
the
unarrived
there
were
a
few
who
had
gained
recognition
but
in
the
main
it
was
not
a
prosperous
gathering
as
commerce
reckons
success
i
give
more
money
for
it
he
declared
than
all
this
bunch
will
make
in
their
lifetime
it
ll
be
on
view
at
the
metropolitan
museum
next
week
when
you
boys
can
take
an
eyefull
it
s
on
my
desk
at
this
present
moment
in
a
plain
wooden
case
it
ain
t
a
big
picture
this
giorgione
his
g
was
wrongly
pronounced
didn
t
paint
em
big
my
wife
don
t
know
anything
about
it
but
she
s
got
the
art
bug
and
she
ll
get
it
morning
as
her
birthday
however
the
lady
was
disappointed
the
wooden
case
was
brought
to
the
table
and
the
magnate
unwrapped
it
with
his
own
fat
fingers
instead
of
the
canvas
representing
a
venetian
fête
and
undraped
ladies
was
the
comic
sheet
of
a
sunday
paper
the
motion
picture
magnate
used
his
weekly
produced
in
innumerable
theatres
to
advertise
his
loss
by
a
production
of
the
missing
picture
it
was
good
advertising
and
made
the
venetian
master
widely
known
but
it
still
reposed
behind
the
washington
the
benares
lamp
was
naturally
his
de
never
in
history
had
such
value
been
gathered
together
in
a
lamp
trent
remembered
seeing
once
in
the
british
museum
a
lamp
from
the
mosque
of
omar
at
jerusalem
on
which
was
inscribed
the
painter
is
the
poor
and
humble
as
he
looked
at
his
own
lantern
he
thought
the
decorator
is
the
unknown
anthony
collectors
of
china
would
have
sneered
at
a
single
vase
on
the
top
of
a
bookcase
it
was
white
enameled
and
had
a
few
flowers
painted
on
it
and
the
inscription
told
the
curious
that
it
was
a
souvenir
of
watch
hill
i
in
reality
it
was
the
celebrated
vase
of
king
senwosri
who
had
gazed
on
it
centuries
before
christ
senator
scrivener
had
bought
it
at
a
great
price
in
cairo
some
day
the
white
enamel
which
trent
had
painted
over
the
imperishable
glass
would
be
carefully
removed
and
it
would
gladden
his
eyes
in
maine
where
visitors
would
be
infrequent
there
were
a
dozen
curious
things
trent
looked
at
things
hidden
from
all
eyes
but
his
which
aroused
exciting
memories
of
a
career
he
fully
believed
had
drawn
to
a
close
he
doubted
if
ever
a
man
in
all
the
history
of
crime
had
taken
what
he
had
taken
and
was
yet
personally
unknown
some
day
if
possible
he
might
be
able
to
learn
from
the
police
what
mental
estimate
they
had
formed
of
him
he
must
loom
large
in
their
eyes
they
must
invest
him
with
a
skill
and
courage
that
would
be
flattering
indeed
were
he
to
learn
of
it
the
occasional
mentions
of
him
he
read
in
daily
papers
were
too
distorted
to
be
interesting
and
mcwalsh
s
tribute
to
the
unknown
master
was
his
only
reward
so
far
the
life
that
was
coming
was
to
be
the
life
he
desired
leisure
the
possession
of
books
the
opportunity
to
wander
as
he
chose
through
far
countries
when
the
war
was
over
and
he
liked
to
think
that
later
he
might
find
love
often
he
had
envied
men
with
children
well
he
could
offer
the
woman
that
he
might
find
comforts
that
fiction
would
never
have
brought
him
he
was
getting
to
have
fewer
qualms
of
conscience
now
he
often
assured
himself
that
he
was
honest
by
comparison
with
war
profiteers
he
had
taken
from
the
rich
and
had
not
withheld
from
the
poor
his
immunity
from
arrest
the
growing
certainty
that
his
cleverness
had
saved
him
from
detection
led
him
on
this
particular
night
to
speculate
upon
his
new
life
with
an
easy
mind
he
had
been
wise
to
avoid
the
dangers
of
friendship
he
had
been
astute
in
selecting
a
woman
like
kinney
who
distrusted
strangers
she
believed
in
him
absolutely
she
looked
to
his
comforts
and
cared
for
his
health
admirably
she
would
assuredly
be
happy
in
maine
and
then
he
remembered
that
during
the
last
week
or
so
she
had
been
strangely
moody
she
had
sighed
frequently
she
had
looked
at
him
constantly
and
gazed
away
when
he
met
her
eye
she
was
old
and
the
old
were
fanciful
as
he
knew
perhaps
after
all
she
regretted
leaving
the
new
york
which
filled
her
with
exquisite
tremblings
and
fear
in
maine
she
would
be
lonely
she
should
have
a
younger
woman
to
aid
her
with
the
house
work
a
physician
should
look
her
over
trent
was
genuinely
fond
of
the
old
woman
he
was
thinking
of
her
when
she
came
into
the
room
undoubtedly
there
was
something
unusual
about
her
there
was
no
longer
the
pleasant
smile
on
her
face
he
was
almost
certain
she
wore
a
look
of
fear
instantly
he
sensed
some
danger
impending
there
s
a
man
been
here
three
times
she
began
what
of
it
he
demanded
so
far
as
she
could
judge
the
news
did
not
disconcert
him
is
there
anybody
you
might
want
to
avoid
she
asked
and
did
not
look
at
him
as
she
spoke
a
thousand
he
smiled
who
was
it
he
wouldn
t
leave
his
what
was
he
like
a
man
she
told
him
sixty
well
dressed
and
polite
but
i
didn
t
trust
him
he
ll
be
back
at
it
was
now
almost
half
past
nine
i
don
t
see
everybody
who
calls
he
reminded
her
you
must
see
him
she
said
seriously
why
he
demanded
he
said
you
would
regret
it
if
you
did
probably
an
enterprising
salesman
he
returned
with
an
appearance
almost
of
boredom
no
he
isn
t
she
said
quickly
there
was
no
doubt
that
kinney
was
terribly
in
earnest
he
affected
the
air
of
composure
he
did
not
feel
who
then
anthony
trent
demanded
i
think
it
s
the
police
she
whispered
then
suddenly
she
fell
to
weeping
oh
trent
she
said
brokenly
i
what
he
cried
sharply
suddenly
alert
to
danger
turned
in
that
moment
from
the
debonair
careless
idler
to
one
in
imminent
risk
of
capture
about
you
she
said
what
about
me
he
exclaimed
impatiently
i
know
how
you
make
your
living
i
didn
t
spy
on
you
sir
believe
me
i
just
happened
on
timidly
she
looked
over
to
the
benares
lamp
gracefully
swinging
in
its
dim
corner
i
know
about
for
a
moment
anthony
trent
said
nothing
a
few
minutes
ago
he
had
sat
in
the
same
chair
as
he
now
occupied
congratulating
himself
on
a
new
life
that
seemed
so
near
and
so
desirable
now
he
was
learning
that
the
little
shrinking
woman
who
so
violently
denounced
crime
and
criminals
had
found
him
out
what
compromise
could
he
effect
with
her
was
it
likely
that
she
was
instrumental
in
denouncing
him
to
the
authorities
tempted
perhaps
by
the
rewards
his
capture
would
bring
for
the
moment
it
was
useless
to
ask
how
she
had
discovered
the
lamp
s
secret
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
demanded
he
was
assuredly
not
going
to
wait
for
the
police
to
arrest
him
if
escape
were
possible
he
might
have
to
shut
the
old
woman
in
a
closet
and
make
his
hurried
exit
he
always
had
a
large
sum
of
money
about
him
of
late
the
banks
had
been
aiding
the
government
by
disclosing
the
names
of
those
depositors
who
invested
sums
of
a
size
that
seemed
incompatible
with
their
positions
and
ways
of
living
he
feared
to
make
such
deposits
that
might
lead
to
investigation
and
of
late
had
secreted
what
money
his
professional
gains
had
brought
him
what
am
i
going
to
do
she
echoed
why
help
you
if
i
he
looked
at
her
suspicion
in
his
gaze
her
manner
convinced
him
that
by
some
means
or
other
she
had
indeed
stumbled
upon
what
he
had
hoped
was
hidden
it
was
not
a
moment
to
ask
her
by
what
means
she
had
done
so
and
equally
it
was
no
moment
for
denial
why
should
you
help
me
he
demanded
he
could
not
afford
blindly
to
trust
any
one
if
you
think
you
have
found
something
irregular
about
me
why
do
you
offer
aid
in
effect
you
have
accused
me
of
being
a
criminal
don
t
you
know
there
s
a
law
against
helping
one
i
m
one
too
she
said
to
his
amazement
nonsense
he
snapped
he
was
too
keen
a
judge
of
character
to
believe
that
this
meek
old
creature
had
fallen
into
evil
ways
do
you
remember
she
said
steadily
and
he
could
see
she
was
intensely
nervous
that
i
told
you
i
had
no
children
when
i
applied
for
this
place
yes
yes
he
answered
impatiently
it
seemed
so
trivial
a
matter
now
well
i
lied
she
returned
i
had
a
daughter
at
the
point
of
death
i
needed
the
position
and
i
heard
you
telling
other
applicants
you
wanted
some
one
with
no
that
s
hardly
criminal
anthony
trent
declared
wait
she
wailed
i
did
worse
you
remember
when
you
furnished
this
place
you
sent
me
to
pay
for
some
rugs
nearly
two
hundred
dollars
it
was
and
you
had
your
pocket
picked
i
i
took
the
money
she
confessed
if
i
had
not
my
girl
would
have
been
buried
with
the
nameless
he
looked
at
the
sobbing
woman
kindly
don
t
worry
about
that
kinney
if
only
you
had
told
me
you
could
have
had
i
know
that
now
she
returned
but
then
i
was
you
ll
stand
by
me
notwithstanding
that
he
pointed
to
the
jeweled
lamp
why
of
course
she
said
simply
and
he
knew
she
was
genuine
almost
as
she
spoke
the
bell
rang
go
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
he
commanded
and
i
will
let
him
in
be
certain
to
see
how
many
there
are
if
there
are
two
or
more
call
out
that
some
men
are
coming
if
it
is
the
one
who
called
before
say
the
gentleman
is
listen
carefully
if
there
are
two
or
more
i
shall
get
out
by
the
roof
meet
me
by
grant
s
tomb
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
you
ve
got
that
kinney
was
perfectly
calm
now
and
he
was
certain
that
her
loyalty
could
be
depended
upon
presently
she
called
out
the
gentleman
is
anthony
trent
rose
slowly
from
his
chair
by
the
window
as
his
visitor
entered
it
was
a
heavily
built
man
of
sixty
or
so
dressed
very
well
at
a
glance
the
stranger
displayed
distinguished
urbanity
what
a
charming
retreat
you
have
here
trent
he
observed
it
is
convenient
said
anthony
trent
shortly
the
word
retreat
sounded
unpleasantly
in
his
ear
it
had
a
sound
of
enforced
seclusion
he
continued
to
study
the
elder
man
there
was
an
inflection
in
his
voice
which
we
are
pleased
to
term
an
english
and
yet
he
did
not
seem
somehow
to
be
an
englishman
his
accent
reminded
trent
of
a
man
he
had
met
casually
two
years
before
it
was
at
a
park
riding
school
where
he
kept
a
saddle
horse
that
he
encountered
him
from
his
accent
he
believed
him
to
be
english
and
was
surprised
when
he
was
informed
that
it
was
captain
von
papen
he
had
taken
to
be
british
he
learned
afterwards
that
the
germans
of
good
birth
generally
learned
their
english
among
england
s
upper
classes
and
acquired
thereby
that
inflection
which
does
not
soothe
the
average
american
this
stranger
had
just
such
a
speaking
voice
obviously
then
he
was
german
and
one
highly
connected
and
at
a
day
when
german
plots
and
intrigue
engaged
public
attention
what
was
he
doing
here
mine
is
a
business
call
said
the
stranger
you
do
not
ask
if
this
is
a
convenient
hour
trent
reminded
him
my
dear
sir
the
other
said
smiling
you
must
understand
that
it
is
a
matter
in
which
my
convenience
is
to
be
consulted
rather
than
the
eyes
that
gleamed
through
the
thick
glasses
were
fixed
on
trent
s
face
with
a
trace
of
amusement
in
them
the
stranger
had
the
look
of
one
who
holds
the
whiphand
over
another
i
don
t
admit
that
anthony
trent
retorted
i
don
t
know
your
name
or
your
errand
and
i
m
not
sure
that
i
want
wait
said
the
other
as
for
my
name
let
it
be
kaufmann
as
for
my
errand
let
us
say
i
am
interested
in
a
history
of
crime
and
want
you
to
be
a
what
qualifications
have
i
for
such
an
honor
anthony
trent
rammed
his
pipe
full
of
hankey
and
lit
it
with
a
hand
that
did
not
tremble
instinctively
he
knew
the
other
watched
for
signs
of
nervousness
you
have
written
remarkable
stories
of
crime
kaufmann
reminded
him
i
regret
that
the
death
of
an
australian
uncle
permitted
you
to
you
will
not
think
it
rude
i
hope
trent
said
with
a
show
of
politeness
if
i
say
that
you
seem
to
be
much
more
interested
in
my
business
than
i
am
in
i
admire
your
national
trait
of
frankness
kaufmann
smiled
and
will
copy
it
i
am
a
merchant
of
zurich
at
bahnhof
street
the
largest
dyer
of
silk
in
switzerland
this
much
you
may
find
through
your
state
department
if
you
and
owing
to
lack
of
business
have
taken
up
a
study
of
crime
trent
commented
your
frankness
impresses
me
favorably
kaufmann
i
still
do
not
see
why
you
visit
me
at
this
we
shall
make
it
plain
kaufmann
assured
him
cordially
first
let
me
tell
you
that
my
business
is
in
danger
this
dye
situation
is
likely
to
ruin
me
i
have
or
had
the
formulae
of
the
dyes
i
used
they
were
my
german
formulae
trent
exclaimed
swiss
kaufmann
corrected
bought
by
me
and
my
property
they
have
been
stolen
from
my
partner
by
an
officious
amateur
detective
one
of
your
allies
and
brought
here
the
ship
should
be
in
shortly
he
will
stay
in
new
york
a
day
or
so
before
going
to
washington
when
he
goes
he
will
take
with
him
my
property
my
dye
formulae
he
will
enrich
american
dyers
at
my
you
can
t
expect
me
to
feel
grieved
about
that
anthony
trent
said
bluntly
i
do
not
said
kaufmann
but
i
must
have
those
he
leaned
forward
and
touched
trent
on
the
arm
you
must
get
trent
knocked
the
gray
ashes
from
his
pipe
the
merchant
of
zurich
gazed
into
a
face
which
wore
amusement
only
he
was
not
to
know
the
dismay
into
which
his
covert
threat
had
thrown
the
younger
man
without
doubt
trent
told
himself
this
stranger
must
have
stumbled
upon
something
which
made
this
odd
visit
a
logical
one
some
discovery
which
would
be
a
sword
over
his
head
in
your
own
country
said
trent
politely
i
have
no
doubt
you
pass
for
a
wit
to
me
your
humor
seems
kaufmann
smiled
urbanely
i
had
hoped
he
asserted
that
you
would
not
have
compelled
me
to
say
again
that
you
get
them
i
fancied
perhaps
that
you
would
be
sensitive
to
any
mention
of
shall
we
say
your
past
my
past
queried
trent
blandly
he
did
not
propose
to
be
bluffed
too
often
he
had
played
that
game
himself
it
might
still
be
that
this
man
a
german
without
question
had
only
guessed
at
his
avocation
and
hoped
to
frighten
him
your
past
repeated
the
merchant
the
phrase
has
possibly
too
vague
a
sound
for
you
let
me
say
rather
your
professional
i
see
trent
smiled
you
are
interested
in
the
writing
of
stories
my
profession
is
that
of
a
fiction
you
fence
well
kaufmann
admitted
but
i
have
a
longer
and
sharper
foil
i
can
wound
you
and
receive
never
a
scratch
in
return
you
speak
of
fiction
permit
me
to
offer
you
a
plot
although
a
swiss
i
have
or
had
many
german
friends
we
are
still
neutral
we
of
switzerland
and
you
can
not
expect
us
to
feel
the
enmities
this
war
has
stirred
up
as
keenly
as
you
and
your
allies
that
i
have
noticed
trent
declared
very
well
then
i
have
a
close
friend
here
one
baron
von
eckstein
you
have
perhaps
heard
of
him
yes
anthony
trent
knitted
his
brow
in
thought
married
a
louis
heiress
didn
t
he
a
very
delightful
lady
and
rich
kaufmann
returned
charitable
too
and
loyal
my
friends
are
all
very
loyal
did
you
know
that
she
donated
ten
ambulances
to
this
country
i
saw
it
in
the
papers
said
anthony
trent
and
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
help
smiling
kaufmann
begged
permission
to
light
a
cigar
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
a
more
urbane
or
genial
gentleman
in
all
switzerland
the
baron
and
baroness
von
eckstein
are
close
since
he
offered
no
other
remarks
anthony
trent
spoke
and
i
am
to
derive
a
story
from
so
slender
a
that
is
but
the
beginning
kaufmann
assured
him
one
night
the
baroness
had
a
very
valuable
necklace
stolen
it
was
worth
a
great
deal
more
than
was
supposed
diamonds
have
gone
up
in
price
she
told
me
about
it
in
my
native
land
i
had
some
little
skill
as
an
amateur
detective
she
had
been
to
a
ball
and
had
met
many
strangers
at
my
request
she
mentioned
those
to
whom
she
had
spoken
at
length
among
them
was
your
name
that
means
nothing
there
were
twenty
others
now
i
come
to
another
interesting
thing
do
i
entertain
you
anthony
trent
simulated
a
yawn
he
gave
the
appearance
of
one
who
listens
because
a
guest
in
his
house
speaks
and
politeness
demands
it
in
reality
a
hundred
schemes
went
racing
through
his
head
and
in
most
of
them
herr
kaufmann
played
a
part
that
would
have
made
him
nervous
had
he
guessed
it
indeed
yes
anthony
trent
assured
him
please
very
well
said
the
other
cheerfully
next
my
plot
takes
me
to
new
bedford
you
know
it
a
mill
town
i
believe
many
of
the
mills
are
owned
by
my
friend
jerome
dangerfield
who
used
to
purchase
my
dyes
we
are
friends
of
thirty
years
he
was
the
owner
of
the
celebrated
mount
aubyn
ruby
it
was
stolen
from
him
knocked
out
of
his
very
hands
a
most
mysterious
case
you
have
heard
of
it
i
saw
that
ten
thousand
dollars
was
offered
for
the
return
of
the
stone
and
capture
of
the
i
made
my
little
list
of
those
to
whom
dangerfield
had
talked
during
his
stay
at
sunset
park
your
name
was
there
if
you
are
thinking
of
writing
it
up
trent
said
kindly
i
must
advise
you
that
editors
of
the
better
sort
rather
frown
on
coincidence
coincidence
in
fiction
is
a
shabby
old
gentleman
with
fewer
friends
every
year
what
next
nothing
now
kaufmann
admitted
readily
since
then
i
have
investigated
you
i
find
you
write
no
more
that
you
live
well
that
while
your
money
supposedly
comes
from
australia
you
never
present
an
australian
draft
at
your
bank
now
my
dear
trent
i
may
misjudge
you
possibly
i
do
but
in
the
interests
of
my
friends
the
baron
and
baroness
to
say
nothing
of
my
customer
jerome
dangerfield
i
may
be
permitted
to
investigate
any
man
whose
way
of
living
seems
suspicious
i
ought
perhaps
to
put
the
matter
into
the
hands
of
the
have
you
trent
demanded
sharply
not
yet
it
may
be
that
i
shall
when
i
leave
here
you
may
be
thinking
what
a
fool
i
am
to
come
here
and
tell
you
these
startling
things
when
you
are
so
much
younger
and
stronger
than
i
should
answer
if
you
asked
me
that
i
have
a
permit
to
carry
a
revolver
and
that
i
have
availed
myself
of
blandly
he
showed
the
other
a
automatic
bayard
pistol
you
may
be
misjudged
he
said
cordially
if
so
i
offer
you
the
apology
of
a
swiss
gentleman
but
consider
my
position
suppose
we
abide
by
the
decision
of
the
he
looked
keenly
at
anthony
trent
are
you
willing
to
leave
it
to
them
shall
i
call
up
spring
kaufmann
gave
trent
the
idea
that
he
knew
very
much
more
about
his
life
than
he
had
so
far
admitted
there
was
a
certainty
about
the
man
that
veiled
disquieting
things
if
he
knew
the
von
ecksteins
and
dangerfield
as
he
claimed
it
was
one
of
those
unfortunate
coincidences
which
life
often
provides
to
humble
supercilious
editors
like
crosbeigh
police
investigation
was
a
thing
trent
feared
greatly
under
his
defense
would
fall
abjectly
it
was
no
good
to
inquire
how
kaufmann
had
found
out
that
he
had
never
offered
an
australian
check
at
his
bank
it
was
sufficient
that
his
charge
was
true
it
is
rather
late
to
bother
the
police
he
said
smiling
kaufmann
breathed
relief
ah
he
said
genially
we
shall
make
excellent
collaborators
i
can
see
that
is
tuesday
on
thursday
at
this
hour
i
shall
come
with
particulars
of
what
i
expect
you
to
do
for
us
us
trent
exclaimed
myself
and
my
partners
kaufmann
explained
yes
at
this
hour
i
shall
come
and
you
will
serve
your
interest
by
doing
in
all
things
as
i
say
the
alternative
is
to
telephone
police
headquarters
and
say
an
elderly
merchant
from
zurich
threatens
you
slanders
you
impels
you
to
perform
unpleasant
kaufmann
smiling
benignly
backed
toward
the
door
he
closed
it
behind
him
a
little
later
anthony
trent
saw
him
on
the
sidewalk
five
stories
below
he
started
as
he
heard
footsteps
behind
him
it
was
kinney
was
it
anything
serious
she
asked
i
m
afraid
it
was
he
answered
i
want
you
to
go
up
to
kennebago
with
me
afternoon
i
shall
take
only
my
personal
baggage
the
furniture
can
wait
the
apartment
will
be
locked
she
spoke
with
a
certain
hesitation
i
listened
to
what
he
was
saying
i
hoped
you
would
he
answered
i
may
need
a
don
t
you
think
it
would
be
wiser
to
wait
and
do
what
he
wants
you
to
perhaps
retorted
her
employer
but
i
don
t
see
how
he
can
find
me
out
in
kennebago
who
knows
about
it
but
you
and
weems
you
haven
t
mentioned
it
to
any
one
and
weems
isn
t
anxious
his
financial
condition
should
be
suspected
and
beside
that
he
s
in
los
angeles
i
shall
pay
the
rent
of
this
flat
up
till
christmas
and
tell
the
agent
i
may
be
back
for
a
few
days
any
time
i
must
leave
the
he
looked
about
him
regretfully
that
could
be
traced
easily
he
decided
to
take
the
benares
lamp
stuart
s
picture
of
washington
the
vase
of
king
senwosri
and
one
or
two
things
of
price
they
could
go
in
his
trunks
but
sir
kinney
persisted
timidly
if
he
finds
you
out
it
may
go
badly
with
you
and
it
wouldn
t
be
difficult
to
get
what
he
perhaps
not
he
said
gravely
but
if
i
were
to
do
one
such
thing
for
them
they
would
use
me
but
he
only
wants
his
dye
formulae
she
reminded
him
don
t
you
understand
he
said
that
he
is
a
german
spy
and
wants
me
to
betray
my
country
chapter
xxviii
the
german
spy
merchant
anthony
trent
rode
into
kennebago
by
the
corduroy
road
from
rangely
it
took
longer
but
it
seemed
a
less
likely
way
of
being
seen
than
if
he
had
taken
the
train
to
kennebago
it
had
been
his
intention
before
kaufmann
had
come
across
his
horizon
to
make
the
call
upon
westward
his
first
action
as
he
stood
at
the
window
of
the
big
dining
room
he
could
see
the
genial
angler
and
john
his
guide
rowing
over
to
the
edge
of
a
favorite
pool
there
he
sat
in
the
stern
rod
in
hand
no
doubt
thinking
of
the
chapter
he
was
writing
on
the
psychology
of
for
years
anthony
trent
had
looked
forward
to
days
like
this
in
his
new
home
but
the
thrill
of
it
was
gone
he
had
hoped
to
look
over
the
lake
to
the
purple
hills
beyond
with
a
serenity
of
mind
that
might
now
never
be
his
how
much
did
kaufmann
know
would
he
lodge
information
with
the
police
dare
he
probably
he
would
not
dare
to
call
but
anonymous
information
of
so
important
a
character
would
speedily
bring
detectives
on
his
trail
beyond
a
question
he
should
have
bought
a
camp
on
some
far
canadian
lake
under
another
name
and
reached
it
by
devious
ways
he
had
betrayed
much
ingenuity
in
bringing
himself
kinney
and
their
baggage
to
kennebago
as
it
was
successions
of
taxis
from
hotel
to
station
and
from
station
to
hotel
crossing
his
own
tracks
a
half
dozen
times
would
make
pursuit
difficult
he
had
no
way
of
estimating
kaufmann
s
skill
at
following
a
clue
but
the
man
had
impressed
him
anthony
trent
who
had
foiled
so
many
next
morning
he
determined
to
fish
and
was
attending
to
his
rods
with
the
loving
care
of
the
conscientious
angler
when
a
knock
came
at
the
door
it
opened
on
to
the
big
screened
piazza
come
in
he
shouted
thinking
kinney
wished
to
consult
him
instead
there
entered
westward
who
greeted
him
heartily
it
was
indeed
an
honor
for
the
piscatorial
expert
called
upon
few
glad
to
see
you
my
dear
fellow
said
westward
shaking
him
by
the
hand
i
happened
to
meet
a
friend
of
yours
who
was
coming
to
see
you
and
lost
his
way
so
i
ve
brought
him
also
wrung
his
he
seemed
no
less
delighted
to
see
trent
than
had
been
westward
what
a
charming
retreat
you
have
here
he
exclaimed
cordially
there
followed
a
conversation
concerning
trout
and
salmon
which
under
normal
conditions
would
have
been
delightful
to
trent
kaufmann
was
affable
genial
and
talked
of
the
finny
spoils
of
his
native
lakes
it
was
only
when
westward
s
erect
form
had
disappeared
down
the
path
that
his
manner
became
forbidding
why
did
you
leave
new
york
he
snapped
because
i
chose
to
said
the
other
what
a
fool
what
a
fool
cried
kaufmann
and
how
fortunate
that
i
am
good
why
trent
demanded
because
i
might
have
had
you
investigated
by
the
police
instead
i
followed
you
here
not
without
difficulty
i
admit
and
renew
my
he
looked
about
the
luxurious
house
that
was
miscalled
a
it
was
not
the
kind
of
home
a
man
would
lose
willingly
i
ask
very
little
i
only
want
a
certain
package
of
letters
which
a
man
who
lands
in
new
york
has
in
his
possession
one
so
skilled
as
you
can
get
it
easily
you
have
presence
education
ready
wit
i
confess
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
believe
you
have
sunk
so
anthony
trent
flushed
angrily
there
are
lower
depths
yet
he
exclaimed
yes
the
other
returned
as
for
instance
your
sort
of
work
he
cried
do
you
suppose
i
imagine
you
to
be
a
swiss
silk
merchant
of
bahnhof
street
kaufmann
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
my
passport
recently
vised
by
your
state
department
is
made
out
to
adolf
kaufmann
of
zurich
i
have
swiss
friends
in
new
york
and
chicago
who
will
identify
naturally
said
trent
simple
precautions
of
that
sort
would
have
to
be
taken
that
s
let
us
get
back
to
business
said
the
other
i
want
those
papers
will
you
get
them
for
me
think
it
over
well
you
may
say
you
will
not
you
may
say
you
prefer
to
remain
here
in
this
delightful
place
and
catch
trout
let
us
suppose
that
you
say
you
defy
me
what
happens
you
lose
all
chance
to
look
at
trout
for
ten
fifteen
twenty
years
accordingly
as
the
judge
regards
your
offenses
i
have
mentioned
only
two
crimes
to
you
of
these
i
have
data
and
am
certain
there
are
two
others
in
which
i
can
interest
myself
if
necessary
i
do
not
wish
to
bother
myself
with
you
after
you
do
as
i
command
get
me
the
papers
and
you
may
remain
here
till
you
have
of
marriageable
age
is
it
worth
defying
me
trent
the
younger
man
groaned
as
he
thought
it
over
the
fabric
he
had
made
so
carefully
was
ready
to
fall
apart
kaufmann
went
on
talking
the
man
you
must
follow
is
called
commander
godfrey
heathcote
of
the
british
navy
on
his
breast
he
wears
the
ribbons
of
the
victoria
cross
a
blue
one
for
the
navy
and
the
red
ribbon
edged
with
blue
of
the
distinguished
service
order
he
is
a
man
much
of
your
build
but
has
straw
colored
hair
and
light
blue
eyes
he
walks
with
a
limp
owing
to
a
wound
received
at
the
zeebrugge
affair
he
is
supposed
to
be
over
here
to
stay
with
relatives
who
have
a
place
on
the
james
river
he
leaves
for
washington
soon
where
his
business
is
with
the
secretary
of
the
navy
the
papers
i
want
are
in
a
pigskin
cigarette
case
old
and
worn
you
d
better
bring
the
case
in
its
kaufmann
rattled
off
his
instructions
in
a
sure
and
certain
manner
evidently
he
had
no
fear
of
being
denied
isn
t
it
unusual
for
an
english
naval
commander
to
carry
trade
secrets
about
with
him
trent
demanded
why
keep
up
the
farce
kaufmann
exclaimed
you
too
are
a
man
of
the
world
you
realize
you
are
in
my
power
and
must
do
as
you
are
must
i
trent
answered
with
a
frown
i
am
asked
to
play
the
traitor
to
my
country
and
you
expect
me
to
accept
without
why
not
kaufmann
returned
would
you
be
the
first
that
fear
of
exposure
has
led
into
such
ways
if
i
were
to
tell
you
how
we
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
smiled
how
we
silk
merchants
of
switzerland
have
used
our
knowledge
of
the
black
pages
of
men
s
lives
or
the
indiscretions
of
well
known
women
you
would
understand
more
readily
how
we
obtain
what
we
i
understand
said
anthony
trent
gloomily
he
was
a
case
in
point
and
you
will
save
yourself
i
don
t
know
said
trent
hesitating
but
he
knew
that
kaufmann
had
made
such
threats
as
these
to
others
and
had
gained
his
desires
what
s
in
those
papers
dye
formulae
smiled
the
elder
man
anthony
trent
looked
at
him
angrily
his
nerves
were
on
edge
plainly
kaufmann
felt
it
unwise
to
stir
the
smouldering
passion
in
him
england
he
informed
the
other
has
recently
reorganized
the
mine
fields
outside
sheerness
at
the
mouth
of
the
thames
commander
heathcote
who
is
here
ostensibly
to
recuperate
from
wounds
is
chosen
to
carry
the
plans
to
the
navy
department
there
you
have
all
i
but
that
s
treachery
trent
cried
what
s
england
to
you
kaufmann
answered
or
you
to
england
i
m
not
asking
you
to
take
american
it
s
the
same
thing
now
trent
persisted
we
re
allies
and
what
s
treachery
to
one
is
treachery
to
the
admirable
kaufmann
sneered
admirable
but
i
invite
you
to
come
down
to
mother
earth
you
are
not
concerned
with
the
affairs
of
nations
you
are
concerned
only
with
your
own
safety
which
is
the
nearer
task
you
get
those
plans
or
you
go
to
prison
you
realize
my
power
i
need
you
you
may
ask
why
i
have
gone
to
this
trouble
to
take
you
a
stranger
more
or
less
into
my
confidence
very
well
i
shall
tell
you
my
own
men
are
working
like
slaves
in
your
accursed
internment
camps
and
i
am
alone
who
had
so
many
to
alone
said
anthony
trent
in
an
altered
voice
and
looked
at
him
oddly
kaufmann
observed
the
look
and
laughed
i
am
a
mind
reader
he
said
cheerfully
i
will
tell
you
what
is
passing
through
your
brain
you
are
wondering
whether
if
those
strong
hands
of
yours
get
a
grip
of
my
throat
your
own
troubles
too
would
not
be
at
an
end
no
my
friend
i
still
have
my
bayard
with
me
and
why
run
the
risk
if
you
should
overpower
me
of
being
tried
for
murder
what
i
ask
of
you
is
very
little
remember
also
that
i
have
but
to
say
the
word
and
you
land
in
you
d
go
with
me
trent
exclaimed
i
think
not
smiled
kaufmann
jerome
dangerfield
and
others
would
vouch
for
me
whereas
i
fear
you
would
be
friendless
and
even
if
i
were
interned
how
would
that
help
you
be
sensible
and
get
ready
to
accompany
me
to
new
york
on
the
five
o
clock
train
i
have
your
it
was
not
easy
to
explain
things
to
kinney
trent
told
her
that
his
suspicions
of
kaufmann
s
german
sympathies
were
wrong
he
said
he
was
compelled
to
get
the
dye
formulae
and
would
return
within
a
few
days
i
shall
come
too
kinney
observed
i
left
a
lot
of
my
things
at
the
flat
and
i
shall
need
it
seemed
to
trent
that
she
was
not
deceived
by
his
words
and
while
he
would
have
preferred
to
leave
her
in
maine
he
could
think
of
no
reason
for
keeping
her
there
if
she
wished
to
leave
all
the
way
he
was
gloomy
to
kaufmann
s
sallies
he
made
morose
answers
presently
the
swiss
left
him
alone
but
trent
could
not
escape
the
feeling
that
his
every
action
was
watched
he
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
bond
servant
to
an
enemy
of
his
country
just
a
final
word
said
kaufmann
as
they
neared
the
street
station
what
else
trent
said
impatiently
he
was
filled
with
disgust
with
himself
and
of
hatred
for
the
german
remember
that
the
cigarette
case
which
holds
my
formulae
is
a
long
flat
one
holding
twelve
cigarettes
on
it
is
stamped
he
does
not
secrete
it
as
you
think
but
exposes
it
carelessly
to
view
i
advise
you
to
go
straight
to
your
apartment
and
await
my
letter
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
find
out
particulars
which
it
might
be
unwise
for
you
to
do
i
don
t
want
you
to
fall
under
you
are
very
thoughtful
sneered
trent
he
knew
well
enough
that
he
had
a
value
in
kaufmann
s
eyes
which
would
be
destroyed
were
he
to
come
under
police
supervision
that
this
was
the
only
case
where
he
was
to
be
used
was
unlikely
having
used
him
once
he
would
be
at
their
command
again
but
would
he
anthony
trent
sat
back
in
his
chair
deep
lines
on
his
drawn
white
face
this
was
the
reward
of
the
life
he
had
led
and
the
way
to
break
from
kaufmann
s
grip
was
to
run
the
risk
of
the
long
prison
term
or
the
taking
of
a
life
and
even
were
he
to
come
to
this
kaufmann
might
be
only
one
of
a
gang
whose
other
members
might
command
his
services
i
shall
send
you
a
message
by
telephone
if
it
is
still
in
your
flat
it
is
good
that
simplifies
matters
wait
until
you
receive
it
and
then
act
anthony
trent
disregarded
the
outstretched
hand
and
cordial
smile
when
a
minute
or
so
later
the
train
pulled
into
the
grand
central
he
hailed
a
taxi
and
drove
to
his
rooms
utterly
obsessed
with
his
bitter
thoughts
it
was
not
until
he
pulled
up
the
shades
and
glanced
about
the
place
that
he
remembered
kinney
he
had
forgotten
her
but
he
relied
on
her
common
sense
sooner
or
later
she
would
come
meanwhile
he
must
wait
for
kaufmann
s
telephone
message
the
message
arrived
before
the
woman
said
kaufmann
your
friend
leaves
for
washington
he
is
staying
at
the
carlton
and
goes
to
his
room
after
dinner
he
will
be
pleased
to
see
you
night
i
shall
call
upon
you
soon
after
the
carlton
was
the
newest
of
the
hotels
the
most
superbly
decorated
the
hotel
that
always
disappointed
the
because
so
little
goldleaf
had
been
used
in
the
process
anthony
trent
had
spent
a
night
or
two
in
every
big
hotel
the
city
boasted
in
a
little
note
book
there
were
certain
salient
features
carefully
put
down
hints
which
might
be
useful
to
him
turning
to
the
book
he
read
it
carefully
he
was
already
acquainted
with
the
general
of
the
hotel
which
had
been
generously
explained
in
the
architectural
papers
the
hotel
detectives
were
men
of
whom
he
liked
to
learn
as
much
as
possible
the
house
detective
the
head
of
them
was
francis
xavier
glynn
who
felt
himself
kin
to
gaboriau
because
of
his
subtle
methods
he
would
often
come
to
the
hotel
desk
and
register
talking
in
a
loud
tone
about
his
western
business
connections
he
dressed
in
what
he
assumed
was
the
western
manner
to
his
associates
this
seemed
the
height
of
cunning
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
high
class
crook
who
prefers
the
high
class
hotel
knew
of
it
and
was
amused
clarke
was
trent
s
informant
the
old
editor
had
pointed
him
out
to
the
younger
man
one
day
when
they
had
met
near
enough
to
the
hotel
s
café
entrance
to
go
in
and
have
a
drink
as
a
rule
trent
made
elaborate
plans
for
the
successful
carrying
out
of
his
work
but
here
he
was
suddenly
told
to
engage
in
a
very
difficult
operation
disguises
must
be
good
indeed
to
stand
the
glare
of
hotel
corridors
and
dining
rooms
he
decided
to
go
and
trust
to
some
plan
suggesting
itself
when
the
moment
arrived
he
registered
as
conway
parker
of
york
pennsylvania
and
the
grip
which
the
boy
carried
to
his
room
had
on
it
york
trent
had
given
a
couple
of
dollars
for
it
at
a
second
hand
store
it
dulled
suspicions
which
might
have
been
aroused
where
the
bag
and
initials
glaringly
new
it
was
part
of
francis
xavier
glynn
s
plan
to
have
the
hotel
boys
report
hourly
on
any
unusual
happening
as
trent
had
waited
to
register
he
noted
the
name
he
was
looking
for
commander
heathcote
had
a
room
on
the
floor
parker
was
assigned
to
one
on
the
seventh
directly
the
boy
had
left
anthony
trent
started
to
work
he
found
just
cause
of
offense
so
far
as
the
location
of
his
room
went
it
was
an
inside
room
and
the
heat
of
the
day
made
it
oppressive
commander
heathcote
as
he
found
by
taking
a
trip
to
the
seventeenth
floor
had
an
outside
room
a
further
investigation
proved
that
immediately
over
the
commander
s
room
was
an
unoccupied
suite
to
effect
the
exchange
was
not
easy
trent
could
not
very
well
dictate
the
location
of
the
room
or
betray
so
exact
a
knowledge
of
hotel
topography
without
incurring
suspicion
but
at
last
the
thing
was
done
the
gentleman
from
york
wanted
a
sitting
room
bedroom
and
bath
and
obtained
it
immediately
over
those
of
the
naval
officer
he
passed
heathcote
in
the
dining
room
and
looked
at
him
keenly
the
two
men
were
of
a
height
heathcote
was
broader
trent
instantly
knew
him
for
that
fighting
type
characterized
by
the
short
straight
nose
cleft
chin
and
light
blue
eyes
it
was
a
man
to
beware
of
in
an
encounter
he
limped
a
little
and
walked
with
a
cane
and
while
he
waited
for
his
d
he
took
out
a
long
pigskin
cigarette
case
it
was
within
ten
feet
of
the
man
who
had
come
to
steal
it
for
a
wild
moment
he
wondered
whether
it
were
possible
to
lunge
for
it
and
make
his
escape
a
moment
later
he
was
annoyed
that
such
a
puerile
thought
had
visited
him
it
meant
that
his
nerves
were
not
under
their
usual
control
after
dinner
two
or
three
men
spoke
to
the
commander
as
he
limped
toward
the
elevator
one
a
british
colonel
shook
hands
heartily
and
congratulated
him
on
the
another
a
stranger
evidently
tried
to
get
him
into
conversation
trent
noted
that
the
commander
although
courteous
to
a
degree
was
not
minded
to
make
hotel
acquaintances
he
declined
a
drink
and
refused
a
cigar
by
taking
out
his
cigarette
case
the
stranger
looked
at
it
curiously
seen
some
service
hasn
t

the
affable
stranger
remarked
and
took
it
from
the
owner
s
hand
a
very
old
pal
said
the
naval
man
trent
had
observed
the
slight
hesitation
before
he
had
permitted
it
to
leave
his
hand
i
wouldn
t
lose
it
for
a
trent
stood
ready
it
might
be
that
this
thick
skinned
stranger
was
after
the
same
loot
as
he
but
he
handed
it
back
and
strolled
off
to
the
café
where
he
joined
a
group
of
perfectly
respectable
business
men
from
columbus

as
most
travelers
in
first

hotels
know
the
eighteenth

of

across
a
block
of
fashionable
private
houses
on
its
north
side
there
is
on
that
account
no
possibility
of
any
prying
stranger
gazing
into
its
rooms
from
across
the
way
towering
above
these
lesser
habitations
the
carlton
looms
inaccessible
austere
remote
in
the
grip
which
had
once
belonged
to
the
unknown
c
of
york
anthony
trent
had
put
the
kit
necessary
for
a
short
stay
there
was
also
certain
equipment
without
which
certain
nervous
travelers
rarely
stray
from
home
for
example
there
was
a
small
axe
in
a
collision
at
sea
many
are
drowned
who
might
escape
did
not
the
impact
have
the
effect
of
jamming
the
doors
of
their
state
rooms
the
axe
in
the
hands
of
the
thoughtful
voyager
could
be
used
to
hack
through
thin
planking
to
freedom
there
was
also
a
small
coil
of
high
grade
rope
tested
to
three
hundred
pounds
in
case
of
fire
the
careful
traveler
might
slide
to
earth
not
of
course
from
an
eighteenth
floor
at
half
past
one
that
night
it
was
very
dark
and
cloudy
a
light
rain
dropped
on
dusty
streets
and
there
was
silence
tying
his
line
to
the
firm
anchorage
of
a
pipe
in
the
bath
room
anthony
trent
began
his
work
he
was
dressed
in
a
dark
blue
suit
he
wore
no
collar
and
on
his
hands
were
dark
gray
gloves
below
him
was
the
green
and
white
striped
awning
that
protected
commander
heathcote
s
windows
it
was
almost
certain
that
an
englishman
would
sleep
with
windows
open
it
was
not
difficult
for
a
gymnast
to
slide
down
the
rope
head
foremost
when
trent
could
touch
the
top
of
the
heathcote
awning
he
took
a
safety
razor
blade
from
his
lips
and
cut
a
slit
across
it
sufficiently
wide
to
admit
his
head
and
shoulders
it
was
not
a
descent
which
caused
much
trouble
there
was
the
chance
that
the
rope
might
break
he
wondered
through
how
many
awnings
he
would
plunge
before
consciousness
left
him
heathcote
was
asleep
by
a
table
near
the
bed
was
an
ash
tray
matches
conrad
s
youth
and
the
cigarette
case
and
lying
near
was
the
stout
cane
which
the
man
who
was
wounded
in
that
splendid
attack
on
zeebrugge
used
to
aid
himself
in
his
halting
walk
trent
with
the
case
in
his
pocket
walked
to
the
door
it
was
not
his
intention
to
make
the
more
hazardous
climb
up
to
his
room
when
so
easy
a
way
of
getting
there
presented
itself
it
was
locked
and
barred
in
his
room
he
sat
and
looked
at
what
he
had
taken
it
represented
so
kaufmann
said
his
freedom
from
arrest
it
contained
plans
of
vital
importance
to
the
allies
they
could
only
be
used
by
the
enemy
to
bring
destruction
to
those
who
fought
for
right
and
what
punishment
would
be
given
the
wounded
hero
for
losing
what
was
entrusted
to
him
for
an
hour
trent
sat
there
looking
at
the
pigskin
case
and
gradually
what
had
seemed
an
impossible
sacrifice
to
make
came
to
be
something
desirable
and
splendid
anthony
trent
had
never
been
able
to
regard
his
career
as
one
justified
by
circumstances
there
burned
in
his
breast
the
spark
of
patriotism
more
strongly
than
he
knew
he
had
fought
his
fight
and
won
his
eyes
were
moist
as
he
thought
of
his
father
that
old
civil
war
soldier
who
had
been
wounded
on
gettysburg
s
bloody
field
and
walked
always
with
a
limp
like
the
english
sailor
beneath
when
he
opened
the
door
heathcote
was
still
slumbering
he
replaced
the
case
as
nearly
in
the
position
he
found
as
he
could
in
that
moment
anthony
trent
felt
he
could
look
any
man
in
the
face
he
was
still
slumbering
when
commander
heathcote
awoke
presently
the
officer
saw
that
the
door
was
unbarred
and
as
investigation
proved
unlocked
i
d
have
sworn

the
commander

chapter

kinney
intervenes
at
his
apartment
which
he
reached
by
noon
he
found
a
note
from
kinney
advising
him
that
she
would
not
be
back
until
late
a
salad
would
be
found
in
the
ice
box
but
his
appetite
had
deserted
him
and
strong
tea
and
crackers
sufficed
him
the
feeling
of
exaltation
which
had
carried
him
along
was
now
dying
down
leaving
in
its
place
a
grim
dogged
determination
he
saw
now
very
clearly
that
the
time
was
come
to
pay
for
his
misdeeds
dimly
he
had
felt
that
some
day
there
would
have
to
be
a
reckoning
he
had
never
thought
it
so
near
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
to
make
his
escape
from
the
man
who
threatened
with
his
swift
motor
he
could
cross
some
sparsely
peopled
border
district
into
canada
or
he
could
drop
down
into
south
or
central
america
and
there
wait
until
the
years
brought
safety
or
he
had
deteriorated
in
fibre
as
do
most
men
of
his
race
in
tropic
sloth
the
thing
that
kept
him
was
a
chivalrous
burning
desire
to
capture
kaufmann
anthony
trent
wondered
how
many
men
weaker
than
he
had
been
forced
to
betray
their
country
as
he
had
very
nearly
done
and
the
knowledge
that
he
had
even
considered
such
baseness
for
a
moment
awakened
a
deep
smouldering
wrath
in
his
mind
that
needed
for
its
outlet
some
expression
of
physical
force
kaufmann
was
strongly
built
and
rugged
but
it
would
hardly
be
a
smiling
suave
spy
that
he
would
drag
before
the
police
at
least
they
would
go
down
to
ruin
together
at
ten
thirty
the
bell
rang
but
the
feeble
steps
that
made
their
weary
ascent
were
those
of
kinney
when
first
he
flung
open
the
door
he
hardly
recognized
her
as
a
rule
neat
and
quietly
dressed
in
black
she
was
wearing
the
faded
gingham
dress
she
used
for
rough
work
a
dress
he
had
seldom
seen
she
wore
no
hat
instead
a
handkerchief
was
on
her
head
she
looked
for
all
the
world
like
some
shabby
denizen
of
the
city
s
foreign
quarters
are
you
expecting
him
she
demanded
yes
he
said
dully
it
was
a
shock
not
to
meet
him
when
he
was
nerved
to
the
task
she
looked
at
him
with
a
certain
triumph
in
her
face
that
was
not
unmixed
with
affection
he
will
never
come
here
what
do
you
mean
he
cried
he
s
it
was
curious
to
note
the
flash
of
her
usually
mild
eye
as
she
said
it
for
a
moment
he
thought
the
old
woman
was
demented
but
her
voice
was
firm
i
followed
him
on
his
way
here
she
went
on
i
found
out
where
he
lived
as
he
crossed
eighth
avenue
at
street
i
told
people
he
was
a
german
spy
there
were
a
lot
of
soldiers
on
their
way
to
the
pennsylvania
station
and
they
started
to
run
after
him
then
a
man
tripped
him
up
but
he
got
to
his
feet
and
crossed
the
road
in
front
of
a
motor
you
are
certain
he
was
killed
i
waited
to
make
sure
she
said
simply
nobody
knew
it
was
i
who
started
calling
him
a
there
was
a
pause
of
half
a
minute
the
knowledge
of
his
safety
was
almost
too
much
for
trent
after
his
hours
of
suspense
i
suppose
you
know
he
said
huskily
that
you
ve
probably
saved
my
life
i
didn
t
do
as
he
wanted
me
to
i
was
prepared
to
denounce
him
to
the
but
they
d
have
got
you
too
she
said
i
know
he
returned
i
d
thought
of
oh
trent
she
cried
oh
trent
then
for
the
second
time
in
the
years
he
had
known
her
she
fell
into
a
fit
of
weeping
when
she
was
recovered
and
had
taken
a
cup
of
strong
tea
she
explained
how
it
was
she
had
tracked
kaufmann
to
his
home
she
had
slipped
away
from
trent
at
the
grand
central
when
he
was
too
much
worried
to
notice
it
kaufmann
walked
the
half
dozen
blocks
to
his
rooms
in
the
house
occupied
by
a
physician
on
street
just
west
of
fifth
avenue
applying
for
work
kinney
was
engaged
instantly
for
two
days
a
week
the
need
for
respectable
women
was
so
great
that
no
references
were
asked
she
was
thus
free
of
the
house
and
regarded
without
suspicion
she
worked
there
the
whole
day
but
learned
nothing
from
the
cook
and
waitress
of
kaufmann
he
rented
the
whole
of
the
second
floor
and
had
a
fad
for
keeping
it
in
order
himself
it
saved
them
trouble
the
maids
said
vaguely
he
was
in
the
importing
business
and
very
wealthy
it
was
while
kaufmann
went
down
to
sign
for
a
registered
letter
that
kinney
slipped
into
the
room
there
was
nothing
in
the
way
of
papers
or
documents
that
she
could
see
because
he
could
not
bear
investigation
anthony
trent
telephoned
to
the
department
of
justice
as
he
had
done
in
the
case
of
frederick
williams
he
felt
certain
that
kaufmann
was
a
highly
placed
official
but
there
was
no
newspaper
mention
of
the
raid
trent
was
not
to
know
that
no
news
was
allowed
to
leak
out
for
the
reason
that
matters
of
enormous
importance
were
discovered
he
was
right
in
assuming
kaufmann
to
be
a
personage
the
mangled
body
was
buried
in
the
potters
field
and
those
lesser
men
depending
on
the
monetary
support
and
counsel
of
kaufmann
were
thrown
into
confusion
his
superiors
in
germany
when
later
they
found
the
allies
in
possession
of
certain
secrets
assumed
their
agent
to
be
interned
altogether
kinney
deserved
her
country
s
thanks
and
now
shall
we
go
back
to
kennebago
not
yet
he
said
smiling
a
little
gravely
not
yet
it
may
be
i
shall
never
see
kennebago
she
looked
at
him
startled
the
affairs
of
the
past
week
had
been
a
great
strain
to
her
i
m
going
to
enlist
he
said
chapter
xxx
private
trent
before
trent
went
to
enlist
he
had
an
understanding
with
kinney
as
to
the
kennebago
camp
she
was
to
live
there
and
keep
the
house
and
gardens
in
good
order
until
he
returned
he
had
none
of
those
premonitions
of
disaster
which
some
who
go
to
war
have
in
abundance
now
that
the
danger
of
his
arrest
was
gone
and
kaufmann
could
never
again
entrap
him
he
felt
cheerful
and
lighthearted
i
shall
come
back
he
told
the
old
woman
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
but
if
not
there
will
be
enough
for
you
to
live
on
i
am
seeing
my
lawyer
about
it
this
on
the
way
to
the
recruiting
station
trent
met
weems
what
branch
are
you
going
in
he
asked
upon
learning
of
trent
s
plans
where
i
m
most
needed
trent
said
cheerfully
infantry
i
you
can
get
a
commission
right
away
weems
cried
a
sudden
thought
striking
him
it
was
in
last
night
s
papers
it
said
that
men
holding
the
degree
were
wanted
and
would
be
commissioned
right
off
the
reel
you
re
a
you
wait
a
bit
be
an
officer
instead
of
an
enlisted
man
i
bet
the
food
s
he
was
a
little
piqued
that
anthony
trent
betrayed
so
little
pleasure
at
the
news
it
so
happened
that
trent
had
given
a
deal
of
thought
to
this
very
thing
and
his
decision
was
to
allow
the
chance
of
a
commission
to
go
there
was
a
strain
of
quixotism
about
him
and
a
certain
fineness
of
feeling
which
went
to
make
this
decision
final
he
loved
his
country
in
the
quiet
intense
manner
which
does
not
show
itself
in
the
waving
of
flags
to
outward
appearances
and
to
the
unjudging
mind
weems
would
seem
the
more
loyal
of
the
two
weems
wore
a
flag
in
his
buttonhole
and
shouted
loudly
his
protestations
and
yet
had
made
no
sacrifice
trent
was
to
offer
his
life
quietly
untheatrically
and
he
wanted
to
wear
no
officer
s
uniform
in
case
his
arrest
or
discovery
would
bring
reproach
upon
it
in
his
mind
he
could
see
headlines
in
the
paper
announcing
that
an
officer
of
the
united
states
army
was
a
notorious
he
shuddered
at
the
word
thief
and
again
there
was
no
certainty
in
his
mind
that
he
would
give
up
his
mode
of
life
in
the
beginning
he
had
set
out
to
obtain
enough
money
to
live
in
comfort
that
long
ago
had
been
achieved
then
the
jewels
to
adorn
his
lamp
occupied
his
mind
and
now
the
game
was
in
his
blood
he
wanted
his
camp
for
recreation
but
it
would
not
satisfy
wholly
when
the
war
was
over
there
would
be
europe
s
fertile
fields
to
work
upon
there
were
many
things
to
aid
him
in
his
feeling
that
the
turning
over
of
a
new
leaf
would
be
useless
nothing
could
ever
undo
what
he
had
done
try
as
he
might
he
would
never
face
the
world
an
honest
man
he
would
go
to
war
he
would
be
a
good
soldier
it
was
in
the
infantry
that
they
needed
men
and
camp
dix
received
him
with
others
so
insignificant
a
thing
was
one
soldier
that
he
presently
felt
a
sense
of
security
that
had
been
denied
him
for
years
the
experiences
he
went
through
in
camp
were
common
to
all
they
were
easier
to
him
than
most
because
of
his
perfection
of
physical
condition
on
the
whole
it
was
interesting
work
but
he
was
glad
when
he
marched
along
the
piers
of
the
army
transport
service
where
formerly
german
lines
had
docked
and
boarded
the
private
trent
was
going
over
it
was
common
knowledge
that
the
regiments
would
not
yet
be
sent
to
france
what
they
had
learned
at
camp
dix
would
be
supplemented
by
a
course
in
england
curiously
enough
trent
found
himself
on
the
sussex
downs
those
rolling
hills
of
chalk
covered
with
short
springy
aromatic
grasses
and
flowers
here
were
a
hundred
sights
and
sounds
that
stirred
his
blood
five
generations
of
trents
had
been
born
in
america
since
that
adventurous
younger
son
had
set
out
for
the
western
world
the
present
anthony
was
coming
back
to
the
ancient
home
of
his
family
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
he
was
coming
back
with
his
mind
purged
of
ancient
enmities
fostered
so
long
by
britain
s
foes
to
further
alien
causes
coming
back
to
a
country
knit
to
his
own
by
bonds
that
would
not
easily
be
broken
it
was
curious
that
he
should
find
himself
here
on
the
high
downs
because
it
was
from
this
county
of
sussex
that
the
trents
sprang
not
far
from
lewes
was
an
old
house
set
among
elms
which
had
been
theirs
for
three
hundred
years
when
he
was
last
in
england
he
had
made
a
pilgrimage
to
it
only
to
find
its
owner
salmon
fishing
in
norway
the
housekeeper
had
shown
him
over
it
a
big
rambling
house
full
of
odd
corridors
and
unexpected
steps
and
he
had
never
failed
to
think
of
it
with
pride
on
that
visit
he
had
been
disappointed
to
find
the
village
church
shut
the
sexton
was
at
his
midday
dinner
trent
had
been
under
canvas
only
a
few
days
when
he
obtained
leave
for
a
few
hours
and
set
out
to
the
church
he
counted
three
anthony
trents
whose
deeds
were
told
on
mural
tablets
one
had
been
an
admiral
one
a
bishop
and
the
third
a
colonel
of
dragoons
at
waterloo
he
sauntered
by
the
old
house
and
looked
at
it
enviously
if
i
bought
that
he
thought
i
would
settle
down
to
the
ways
of
honest
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
were
many
things
yet
to
be
done
it
was
only
since
he
had
been
in
england
and
seen
her
wounded
that
he
realized
what
none
can
until
it
is
witnessed
the
certainty
that
there
must
be
much
suffering
before
the
end
is
achieved
the
men
in
his
company
were
not
especially
congenial
they
were
friendly
enough
but
their
interests
were
narrow
trent
was
glad
when
the
training
period
was
over
and
he
embarked
in
the
troop
train
for
dover
to
the
western
front
he
made
a
good
soldier
more
than
one
of
his
mates
said
he
would
wear
the
chevrons
before
many
weeks
but
he
was
anxious
for
no
such
distinction
at
the
time
his
regiment
arrived
in
france
the
american
troops
were
at
grips
with
the
enemy
it
was
the
first
time
that
they
held
as
a
unit
part
of
the
line
the
germans
already
making
their
retreat
left
in
the
rear
nests
of
machine
gunners
to
hamper
the
pursuers
to
clear
these
nests
of
hornets
to
search
abandoned
cellars
and
buildings
where
men
or
bombs
might
be
lying
in
wait
was
a
task
far
more
deadly
than
participation
in
a
battle
only
men
strong
to
act
and
quick
to
think
were
needed
there
was
a
day
when
volunteers
were
asked
for
anthony
trent
was
the
first
man
to
offer
himself
under
a
lieutenant
this
band
of
brave
men
went
about
its
dangerous
task
the
casualties
were
many
and
among
them
the
officer
he
had
made
such
an
impression
on
his
men
and
they
had
gained
such
favorable
mention
for
gallant
conduct
that
there
was
a
fear
lest
the
new
officer
might
be
of
less
vigorous
and
dashing
nature
it
was
work
this
nest
clearing
danger
that
trent
liked
enormously
he
had
come
to
know
what
traps
the
hun
was
likely
to
set
the
tempting
the
field
glasses
the
the
touching
of
which
meant
maiming
at
the
least
and
against
some
of
these
trapped
men
trent
revived
his
old
football
tackle
and
brought
them
startled
to
the
ground
it
was
the
most
stirring
game
of
his
life
but
one
look
at
the
new
officer
changed
his
mood
he
looked
at
his
lieutenant
and
his
lieutenant
looked
at
him
and
the
officer
licked
his
lips
hungrily
it
was
devlin
whom
he
had
laughed
at
in
san
francisco
instinctively
the
men
who
observed
this
meeting
sensed
some
hatred
and
speculated
on
its
origin
recollecting
himself
trent
saluted
so
i
ve
got
a
thief
in
my
company
devlin
sneered
i
ll
have
to
watch
you
pretty
close
looting
s
it
was
plain
to
the
men
who
watched
devlin
s
subsequent
plan
of
action
that
he
was
trying
to
goad
the
enlisted
man
into
striking
him
in
france
the
discipline
of
the
american
army
was
taking
on
the
sterner
character
of
that
which
distinguished
the
allies
no
task
had
ever
been
so
difficult
for
anthony
trent
as
this
continual
curb
he
was
compelled
to
put
upon
his
tongue
devlin
had
always
disliked
him
he
was
maddened
at
the
thought
that
trent
had
taken
the
mount
aubyn
ruby
from
under
his
nose
it
was
because
of
this
dangerfield
had
discharged
him
from
a
lucrative
position
and
in
the
case
of
the
takowaja
emerald
it
was
anthony
trent
who
had
laughed
at
him
many
an
hour
had
devlin
spent
trying
to
weave
the
rope
that
would
hang
him
and
in
these
endeavors
he
had
gathered
many
odds
and
ends
of
information
over
which
he
chuckled
with
joy
but
first
of
all
he
wanted
to
break
his
enemy
there
was
no
opportunity
of
which
he
did
not
take
advantage
ordinarily
his
superior
officers
would
have
witnessed
this
policy
and
reprimanded
him
but
conditions
were
such
that
their
special
duties
kept
devlin
and
his
men
apart
from
their
comrades
devlin
was
a
good
officer
and
credit
was
given
him
for
much
that
trent
deserved
it
chanced
one
night
that
while
they
waited
for
a
little
wood
to
be
cleared
of
gas
devlin
and
trent
sat
within
a
few
feet
of
one
another
it
was
an
opportunity
devlin
was
quick
to
seize
thought
you
d
fooled
me
in
frisco
didn
t
you
trent
lighted
a
cigarette
with
exasperating
slowness
i
did
fool
you
he
asserted
calmly
it
is
never
hard
to
fool
a
man
with
your
mental
huh
devlin
grunted
you
ve
got
the
criminal
s
low
cunning
i
ll
admit
that
maltby
of
he
made
a
labored
pretence
of
hunting
for
his
cigarette
case
gone
he
said
sneering
some
one
s
lifted
it
but
i
guess
you
know
where
it
is
oh
no
i
forgot
you
weren
t
a
dip
you
were
a
second
story
man
excuse
he
kept
this
heavy
and
malicious
humor
going
until
trent
s
imperturbability
annoyed
him
what
a
change
he
commented
presently
me
the
officer
and
you
the
enlisted
man
who
s
got
to
do
as
i
say
you
with
your
fast
auto
and
your
golf
and
society
ways
and
me
who
used
to
be
a
winning
no
retort
from
his
victim
he
leaned
forward
and
pushed
trent
roughly
he
started
back
at
the
white
wrath
which
transfigured
the
other
s
face
look
here
devlin
trent
cried
savagely
you
want
me
to
hit
you
so
you
can
prefer
charges
against
me
for
striking
an
officer
and
have
me
disciplined
listen
to
this
if
you
put
your
filthy
hand
on
me
again
i
won
t
hit
you
i
ll
kill
towering
and
threatening
he
stood
over
the
other
devlin
who
knew
men
and
the
ways
of
violence
looked
into
trent
s
face
and
recognized
it
was
no
idle
threat
he
heard
that
would
be
a
hell
of
a
fine
trick
he
said
a
little
unsteadily
to
empty
your
gun
in
my
you
know
i
wouldn
t
do
it
that
way
trent
retorted
why
should
i
let
you
off
so
easily
as
that
easily
devlin
repeated
when
i
get
ready
trent
said
grimly
i
shall
want
you
to
realize
what
s
coming
to
is
that
a
threat
devlin
demanded
trent
nodded
his
head
it
s
a
devlin
thought
for
a
moment
i
ll
fix
you
he
said
how
trent
inquired
you
ve
tried
every
way
there
is
to
have
me
killed
if
there
s
a
doubtful
place
where
some
boches
may
be
hiding
with
bombs
whom
do
you
send
to
find
out
you
send
private
trent
i
m
not
kicking
i
volunteered
for
the
job
i
came
out
to
do
what
i
could
my
one
disappointment
is
that
my
officer
is
not
also
a
devlin
s
face
was
now
better
humored
i
ll
fix
you
he
said
again
i
ll
see
pershing
pins
a
medal
on
you
all
trent
wondered
what
he
meant
and
he
wondered
why
for
a
day
or
two
devlin
goaded
him
no
more
instead
he
looked
at
him
as
one
who
knew
another
was
marked
down
for
death
and
disgrace
it
was
inevitable
that
anthony
trent
could
never
know
how
near
to
discovery
he
was
the
odds
are
against
the
best
breakers
of
law
the
history
of
crime
told
him
that
the
cleverest
had
been
captured
by
some
trifling
piece
of
carelessness
had
devlin
some
such
clue
he
wondered
chapter
xxxi
devlin
s
revenge
there
came
a
night
when
devlin
s
men
were
called
upon
to
clean
out
part
of
a
forest
from
which
many
snipers
had
been
firing
and
where
machine
guns
and
their
crews
were
known
to
be
it
was
work
for
picked
men
only
and
trent
admitted
devlin
made
a
courageous
leader
the
americans
met
unexpectedly
strong
opposition
it
was
only
when
half
their
little
company
was
lost
that
they
were
ordered
to
retreat
the
way
was
made
difficult
with
barbed
wire
and
shell
splintered
trees
it
was
one
of
a
hundred
similar
sorties
taking
place
all
along
the
allied
lines
hardly
worthy
of
mention
in
the
press
trent
when
he
had
gained
a
clearing
in
the
wood
saw
devlin
go
down
like
an
ox
from
the
clubbed
rifle
in
a
prussian
hand
trent
had
put
a
shot
through
the
man
s
head
almost
before
devlin
s
body
fell
to
the
soft
earth
he
had
an
excellent
chance
of
escape
alone
but
he
could
not
leave
the
american
officer
who
was
his
enemy
to
bleed
to
death
among
his
country
s
foes
he
was
almost
spent
when
he
reached
his
own
lines
and
the
red
cross
relieved
him
of
his
inert
burden
they
told
him
devlin
still
lived
three
days
later
trent
was
called
to
the
hospital
in
which
his
officer
lay
white
and
bandaged
although
devlin
s
voice
was
weak
it
did
not
lack
the
note
of
enmity
which
ever
distinguished
it
when
its
owner
spoke
to
anthony
trent
what
did
you
do
it
for
devlin
demanded
do
what
bring
me
in
after
that
boche
laid
me
out
only
one
reason
trent
informed
him
alive
you
have
a
certain
use
to
your
country
dead
you
would
have
that
s
a
lie
devlin
snarled
i
ve
figured
it
out
lying
in
this
damned
cot
you
saw
i
wasn
t
badly
hurt
and
you
knew
some
of
the
boys
would
fetch
me
in
later
you
thought
you
d
do
a
hero
stunt
and
get
a
decoration
and
you
reckoned
i
d
be
grateful
and
let
up
on
you
that
was
clever
but
not
clever
enough
for
me
i
see
through
it
you
ve
got
away
with
the
other
feller
so
far
but
i
m
one
jump
ahead
of
you
in
he
paused
for
breath
i
ve
got
you
fixed
mister
anthony
trent
and
don
t
you
forget
it
you
think
i
m
bluffing
i
i
think
you
re
exciting
yourself
unduly
trent
said
quietly
take
it
up
when
you
are
you
re
afraid
to
hear
what
i
know
devlin
sneered
you
ve
got
to
hear
it
sometime
so
why
not
now
trent
spoke
as
one
does
to
a
child
or
a
querulous
invalid
well
what
is
it
he
demanded
never
heard
of
any
one
named
austin
did
you
it
s
not
an
unusual
name
trent
admitted
but
he
was
no
longer
uninterested
conington
warren
s
butler
was
so
called
and
this
austin
had
met
him
face
to
face
on
the
stairway
of
his
master
s
house
on
the
night
that
he
had
taken
conington
warren
s
loose
cash
and
jewels
he
s
out
here
devlin
said
and
looked
hard
at
trent
to
see
what
effect
the
news
would
have
you
forget
i
don
t
know
whom
trent
reminded
him
what
austin
you
know
devlin
snapped
the
warren
butler
i
was
on
that
case
and
he
recognized
me
not
a
week
ago
and
asked
me
who
you
were
he
s
seen
you
too
we
put
two
and
two
together
and
it
spells
the
pen
for
you
he
was
english
and
although
he
was
over
age
the
british
are
polite
that
way
if
he
said
he
was
they
said
they
guessed
he
was
i
went
to
see
him
in
a
hospital
before
he
went
west
and
he
told
me
all
about
anthony
trent
could
not
restrain
a
sigh
of
relief
austin
was
dead
that
don
t
help
you
any
devlin
cried
don
t
you
wish
you
d
left
me
in
the
woods
now
that
was
your
opportunity
why
didn
t
you
take
it
you
wouldn
t
understand
trent
answered
for
one
thing
you
dislike
me
too
much
to
see
anything
but
bad
in
what
i
do
that
s
your
weakness
that
s
why
you
have
always
well
i
haven
t
failed
this
time
devlin
taunted
him
i
ve
laid
information
against
you
where
it
s
going
to
do
most
he
hoped
to
see
the
man
he
hated
exhibit
fear
plead
for
mercy
or
beg
for
a
respite
he
had
rehearsed
this
expected
scene
during
the
night
watches
instead
he
saw
the
face
inscrutable
as
ever
i
ve
told
the
adjutant
what
i
know
and
what
austin
said
and
he
s
bound
to
make
an
investigation
that
means
you
ll
be
sent
home
for
trial
and
i
guess
you
know
what
that
means
i
m
going
to
be
invalided
home
and
i
ll
put
in
my
leave
working
up
the
case
against
you
they
ought
to
give
you
a
stretch
of
anything
from
fifteen
to
twenty
years
i
guess
that
ll
hold
you
mister
anthony
the
other
man
made
no
answer
he
thought
instead
of
what
such
a
prison
term
would
do
for
him
he
had
seen
the
gradual
debasement
of
men
of
even
a
high
type
during
the
long
years
of
internment
men
who
had
gone
through
prison
gates
with
the
same
instincts
of
refinement
as
he
possessed
to
come
out
coarsened
different
never
again
to
be
the
men
they
were
he
would
sidle
through
the
gaping
doors
a
furtive
thing
with
cunning
crafty
eyes
whose
very
walk
stamped
him
a
convict
how
could
so
long
a
term
of
years
spent
among
professional
criminals
fail
to
besmirch
him
he
took
a
long
breath
i
m
not
there
yet
he
said
it
s
a
long
way
to
an
american
jail
and
a
good
bit
can
happen
in
three
thousand
he
was
turned
from
these
dismal
channels
of
thought
by
a
hospital
orderly
who
summoned
him
to
the
adjutant
s
quarters
in
civil
life
this
officer
had
been
a
well
known
lawyer
who
had
abandoned
a
large
practice
to
take
upon
himself
the
over
work
and
worries
that
always
hurl
themselves
at
an
adjutant
he
had
heard
of
the
rescue
of
lieutenant
devlin
by
a
man
of
his
company
and
was
pleased
to
learn
that
it
was
an
alumnus
of
his
old
college
who
had
been
recommended
for
a
decoration
on
that
account
he
looked
at
trent
a
moment
in
silence
when
i
last
saw
you
he
said
you
won
the
game
for
us
against
he
sighed
i
never
thought
to
see
you
in
a
case
of
this
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
sir
trent
answered
him
for
some
reason
or
another
the
adjutant
informed
him
lieutenant
devlin
has
preferred
charges
against
you
which
had
better
been
left
until
this
war
is
over
in
my
opinion
as
a
i
am
still
in
the
dark
trent
reminded
him
captain
sutton
looked
over
some
papers
you
are
charged
he
said
with
being
a
very
remarkable
and
much
sought
after
criminal
devlin
asserts
you
purloined
a
ruby
owned
by
dangerfield
worth
a
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
and
an
emerald
worth
almost
as
what
a
curious
delusion
trent
commented
with
calmness
delusion
retorted
the
adjutant
what
else
could
it
be
the
other
inquired
it
might
be
the
truth
the
officer
said
drily
does
he
offer
proofs
more
i
m
afraid
than
you
ll
care
to
read
captain
sutton
told
him
you
understand
i
suppose
that
there
are
certain
regulations
which
govern
us
in
a
case
like
this
i
should
like
to
dismiss
it
as
something
entirely
irrelevant
to
military
duties
you
were
a
damned
good
football
player
trent
and
they
tell
me
you
re
just
as
good
a
soldier
but
an
officer
has
preferred
charges
against
you
and
they
must
be
given
attention
sit
down
there
for
a
few
devlin
feeling
the
hour
of
triumph
approaching
lay
back
in
his
bed
gloating
the
hatred
that
he
bore
anthony
trent
was
legitimate
enough
in
its
way
by
some
accident
or
another
devlin
was
enlisted
on
the
side
of
the
law
and
his
opponent
against
it
one
was
the
hunter
the
other
the
hunted
and
the
hunter
was
soon
to
witness
the
disgrace
of
the
man
who
had
laughed
at
him
beaten
him
cheated
him
of
a
coveted
position
naturally
of
a
brave
and
pugnacious
disposition
devlin
saw
no
lack
of
chivalry
in
hounding
a
man
over
whom
he
had
military
authority
if
trent
had
been
his
friend
he
would
have
fought
for
him
but
since
he
was
his
foe
he
must
taste
the
bitterness
of
the
vanquished
so
engrossed
was
he
over
his
pleasurable
thoughts
that
he
did
not
see
the
distress
which
came
over
the
face
of
the
nurse
who
took
his
temperature
and
recorded
his
pulse
beat
nor
did
he
see
the
hastily
summoned
physician
reading
the
recently
marked
chart
over
the
bed
instead
he
was
filled
with
a
strange
and
satisfying
exaltation
of
spirit
catches
of
old
forgotten
songs
came
back
to
him
he
felt
himself
growing
stronger
he
was
devlin
the
superman
the
captor
of
anthony
trent
who
had
beaten
the
best
of
them
it
was
almost
with
irritation
that
he
opened
his
eyes
to
speak
with
the
doctor
a
gray
man
with
kindly
eyes
lieutenant
the
doctor
said
gently
things
aren
t
going
as
well
with
you
as
we
hoped
you
should
not
have
exhausted
yourself
talking
it
should
not
have
been
devlin
saw
the
doctor
put
his
hand
under
the
coverlet
then
he
felt
a
prick
in
his
arm
dully
he
knew
that
it
was
the
sting
of
a
hypodermic
then
he
saw
coming
toward
him
a
priest
of
his
race
and
faith
and
knew
he
came
in
that
dread
hour
to
administer
the
last
rites
of
the
church
doc
he
gasped
am
i
going
it
was
no
moment
to
utter
lying
comfort
i
m
afraid
then
he
saw
an
orderly
bringing
the
screen
that
was
placed
about
the
beds
of
those
about
to
die
when
captain
sutton
and
anthony
trent
came
into
the
ward
the
priest
had
finished
his
solemn
work
and
was
gone
to
console
another
dying
man
and
the
physicians
to
make
one
of
those
quick
operations
unthinkable
in
the
leisurely
days
of
peace
trent
had
no
knowledge
of
what
had
taken
place
during
his
absence
he
saw
that
his
enemy
was
more
exhausted
and
as
he
looked
he
noticed
that
the
eyes
of
devlin
lacked
something
of
their
hate
but
it
was
no
time
for
speculation
trent
saw
in
the
sick
man
only
his
nemesis
the
instrument
which
fate
was
using
to
rob
him
of
his
liberty
he
was
not
to
know
that
here
was
a
man
so
close
to
death
that
hate
seemed
idle
and
vengeance
a
burden
lieutenant
captain
sutton
began
i
have
here
a
copy
of
your
statements
and
the
evidence
given
by
sergeant
austin
of
the
british
army
i
will
read
it
to
you
then
i
shall
need
witnesses
to
your
let
me
see
it
devlin
commanded
and
drew
the
typewritten
sheets
to
him
then
with
what
strength
was
left
him
he
tore
the
document
across
and
across
again
captain
sutton
looked
at
him
in
amazement
what
did
you
do
that
for
he
asked
but
devlin
paid
no
heed
to
him
he
gazed
into
the
face
of
anthony
trent
the
man
he
had
hated
i
made
a
mistake

devlin
faintly
