i
an
event
in
skellorn
life
i
the
lessways
household
consisting
of
hilda
and
her
widowed
mother
was
temporarily
without
a
servant
hilda
hated
domestic
work
and
because
she
hated
it
she
often
did
it
passionately
and
thoroughly
that
afternoon
as
she
emerged
from
the
kitchen
her
dark
defiant
face
was
full
of
grim
satisfaction
in
the
fact
that
she
had
left
a
kitchen
polished
and
irreproachable
a
kitchen
without
the
slightest
indication
that
it
ever
had
been
or
ever
would
be
used
for
preparing
human
daily
food
a
show
kitchen
even
the
apron
which
she
had
worn
was
hung
in
concealment
behind
the
scullery
door
the
lobby
clock
which
stood
over
six
feet
high
and
had
to
be
wound
up
every
night
by
hauling
on
a
rope
was
noisily
getting
ready
to
strike
two
but
for
disorderly
and
undesired
assistance
hilda
task
might
have
been
finished
a
quarter
of
an
hour
earlier
she
passed
quietly
up
the
stairs
when
she
was
near
the
top
her
mother
voice
at
once
querulous
and
amiable
came
from
the
where
are
you
going
to
there
was
a
pause
dramatic
for
both
of
them
and
in
that
minute
pause
the
very
life
of
the
house
seemed
for
an
instant
to
be
suspended
and
then
the
waves
of
the
hostile
love
that
united
these
two
women
resumed
their
beating
and
hilda
lips
hardened
upstairs
she
answered
callously
no
reply
from
the
at
two
on
the
last
wednesday
of
every
month
old
skellorn
employed
by
lessways
to
collect
her
called
with
a
statement
of
account
and
cash
in
a
linen
bag
he
was
now
due
during
his
previous
visit
hilda
had
sought
to
instil
some
common
sense
into
her
mother
on
the
subject
of
repairs
and
there
had
ensued
an
altercation
which
had
never
been
settled
if
i
stayed
down
she
would
like
it
hilda
complained
fiercely
within
herself
and
if
i
keep
away
she
does
like
that
either
mother
all
over
she
went
to
her
bedroom
and
into
the
soft
controlled
shutting
of
the
door
she
put
more
exasperated
vehemence
than
would
have
sufficed
to
bang
it
off
its
hinges
ii
at
this
date
late
october
in
hilda
was
within
a
few
weeks
of
she
was
a
woman
but
she
could
not
realize
that
she
was
a
woman
she
remembered
that
when
she
first
went
to
school
at
the
age
of
eight
an
assistant
teacher
aged
nineteen
had
seemed
to
her
to
be
unquestionably
and
absolutely
a
woman
had
seemed
to
belong
definitely
to
a
previous
generation
the
years
had
passed
and
hilda
was
now
older
than
that
mature
woman
was
then
and
yet
she
could
not
feel
adult
though
her
childhood
gleamed
dimly
afar
off
and
though
the
intervening
expanse
of
ten
years
stretched
out
like
a
hundred
years
like
eternity
she
was
in
trouble
the
trouble
grew
daily
more
and
more
tragic
and
the
trouble
was
that
she
wanted
she
knew
not
what
if
her
mother
had
said
to
her
squarely
tell
me
what
it
is
will
make
you
a
bit
more
contented
and
you
shall
have
it
even
if
it
kills
me
hilda
could
only
have
answered
with
the
fervour
of
despair
i
do
know
i
do
know
her
mother
was
a
creature
contented
enough
and
why
not
with
a
sufficient
income
a
comfortable
home
and
fair
health
at
the
end
of
a
day
devoted
partly
to
sheer
vacuous
idleness
and
partly
to
the
monotonous
simple
machinery
of
physical
existence
everlasting
cookery
everlasting
cleanliness
everlasting
stitchery
her
mother
did
not
with
a
yearning
sigh
demand
must
this
sort
of
thing
continue
for
ever
or
will
a
new
era
dawn
not
a
bit
lessways
went
to
bed
in
the
placid
expectancy
of
a
very
similar
day
on
the
morrow
and
of
an
interminable
succession
of
such
days
the
which
was
incomprehensible
and
offensive
to
hilda
she
was
in
a
prison
with
her
mother
and
saw
no
method
of
escape
saw
not
so
much
as
a
locked
door
saw
nothing
but
blank
walls
even
could
she
by
a
miracle
break
prison
where
should
she
look
for
the
unknown
object
of
her
desire
and
for
what
should
she
look
enigmas
it
is
true
that
she
read
occasionally
with
feverish
enjoyment
especially
verse
but
she
did
not
and
could
not
read
enough
of
the
of
books
which
in
thirty
years
had
drifted
by
one
accident
or
another
into
the
lessways
household
she
had
read
every
volume
except
concordance
a
heterogeneous
and
forlorn
assemblage
in
a
translation
and
in
full
calf
thomson
which
had
thrilled
her
by
its
romantic
beauty
henry
and
one
or
two
novels
by
charlotte
yonge
and
dinah
maria
craik
which
she
had
gulped
eagerly
down
for
the
mere
interest
of
their
stories
disraeli
which
she
had
admired
without
understanding
it
a
of
the
north
american
indians
these
were
the
more
exciting
items
of
the
set
the
most
exciting
of
all
was
a
green
volume
of
tennyson
containing
she
knew
by
heart
by
simple
unpleasant
obstinacy
she
had
forced
her
mother
to
give
her
this
volume
for
a
birthday
present
having
seen
a
quotation
from
it
in
a
ladies
magazine
at
that
date
in
turnhill
as
in
many
other
towns
of
england
the
poem
had
not
yet
lived
down
a
reputation
for
immorality
but
fortunately
lessways
had
only
the
vaguest
notion
of
its
dangerousness
and
was
indeed
a
negligent
kind
of
woman
dangerous
the
book
was
once
in
reciting
it
aloud
in
her
room
hilda
had
come
so
near
to
fainting
that
she
had
had
to
stop
and
lie
down
on
the
bed
until
she
could
convince
herself
that
she
was
not
the
male
lover
crying
to
his
beloved
an
astounding
and
fearful
experience
and
not
to
be
too
lightly
renewed
for
hilda
was
a
source
of
lovely
and
exquisite
pain
why
had
she
not
used
her
force
of
character
to
obtain
more
books
one
reason
lay
in
the
excessive
difficulty
to
be
faced
birthdays
are
infrequent
and
besides
the
enterprise
of
purchasing
had
proved
so
complicated
and
tedious
that
lessways
with
that
curious
stiffness
which
marked
her
sometimes
had
sworn
never
to
attempt
to
buy
another
book
turnhill
a
town
of
fifteen
thousand
persons
had
no
bookseller
the
only
bookseller
that
lessways
had
ever
heard
of
did
business
at
oldcastle
lessways
had
journeyed
twice
over
the
hillport
ridge
to
oldcastle
in
the
odd
quest
of
a
book
called
by
tennyson
the
poet
laureate
the
book
had
had
to
be
sent
from
london
and
on
her
second
excursion
to
oldcastle
lessways
had
been
caught
by
the
rain
in
the
middle
of
hillport
marsh
no
hilda
could
not
easily
demand
the
gift
of
another
book
when
all
sorts
of
nice
really
useful
presents
could
be
bought
in
the
high
street
nor
was
there
in
turnhill
a
municipal
library
nor
any
public
yet
possibly
hilda
terrific
egoism
might
have
got
fresh
books
somehow
from
somewhere
had
she
really
believed
in
the
virtue
of
books
thus
far
however
books
had
not
furnished
her
with
what
she
wanted
and
her
faith
in
their
promise
was
insecure
books
failing
might
she
not
have
escaped
into
some
vocation
the
sole
vocation
conceivable
for
her
was
that
of
teaching
and
she
knew
without
having
tried
it
that
she
abhorred
teaching
further
there
was
no
economical
reason
why
she
should
work
in
unless
pushed
by
necessity
no
girl
might
dream
of
a
vocation
the
idea
was
monstrous
it
was
almost
unmentionable
still
further
she
had
no
wish
to
work
for
work
sake
marriage
remained
but
she
felt
herself
a
child
ages
short
of
marriage
and
she
never
met
a
man
it
was
literally
a
fact
that
except
skellorn
a
few
tradesmen
the
vicar
the
curate
and
a
sidesman
or
so
she
never
even
spoke
to
a
man
from
one
month
end
to
the
next
the
church
choir
had
its
annual
dance
to
which
she
was
invited
but
the
perverse
creature
cared
not
for
dancing
her
mother
did
not
seek
society
did
not
appear
to
require
it
nor
did
hilda
acutely
feel
the
lack
of
it
she
could
not
define
her
need
all
she
knew
was
that
youth
moment
by
moment
was
dropping
down
inexorably
behind
her
and
still
a
child
in
heart
and
soul
she
saw
herself
ageing
and
then
aged
and
then
withered
her
birthday
was
well
above
the
horizon
soon
soon
she
would
be
and
she
was
not
yet
born
that
was
it
she
was
not
yet
born
if
the
passionate
strength
of
desire
could
have
done
the
miracle
time
would
have
stood
still
in
the
heavens
while
hilda
sought
the
way
of
life
and
withal
she
was
not
wholly
unhappy
just
as
her
attitude
to
her
mother
was
so
was
her
attitude
towards
existence
sometimes
this
profound
infelicity
of
hers
changed
its
hues
for
an
instant
and
lo
it
was
bliss
that
she
was
bathed
in
a
phenomenon
which
disconcerted
her
she
did
not
know
that
she
had
the
most
precious
of
all
faculties
the
power
to
feel
intensely
iii
skellorn
did
not
come
he
was
most
definitely
late
from
the
window
of
her
bedroom
at
the
front
of
the
house
hilda
looked
westwards
up
toward
the
slopes
of
chatterley
wood
where
as
a
child
she
used
to
go
with
other
children
to
pick
the
sparse
bluebells
that
thrived
on
smoke
the
bailiwick
of
turnhill
lay
behind
her
and
all
the
murky
district
of
the
five
towns
of
which
turnhill
is
the
northern
outpost
lay
to
the
south
at
the
foot
of
chatterley
wood
the
canal
wound
in
large
curves
on
its
way
towards
the
undefiled
plains
of
cheshire
and
the
sea
on
the
exactly
opposite
to
hilda
window
was
a
that
sometimes
made
nearly
as
much
smoke
as
the
kilns
and
chimneys
closing
the
prospect
on
either
hand
from
the
a
bricked
path
which
separated
a
considerable
row
of
new
cottages
from
their
appurtenant
gardens
led
straight
into
lessways
street
in
front
of
lessways
house
by
this
path
skellorn
should
have
arrived
for
he
inhabited
the
farthest
of
the
cottages
hilda
held
skellorn
in
disdain
as
she
held
the
row
of
cottages
in
disdain
it
seemed
to
her
that
skellorn
and
the
cottages
mysteriously
resembled
each
other
in
their
primness
their
smugness
their
detestable
yet
those
cottages
perhaps
thirty
in
all
had
stood
for
a
great
deal
until
hilda
glancing
at
them
shattered
them
with
her
scorn
the
row
was
called
freehold
villas
a
consciously
proud
name
in
a
district
where
much
of
the
land
was
copyhold
and
could
only
change
owners
subject
to
the
payment
of
and
to
the
feudal
consent
of
a
presided
over
by
the
agent
of
a
lord
of
the
manor
most
of
the
dwellings
were
owned
by
their
occupiers
who
each
an
absolute
monarch
of
the
soil
niggled
in
his
sooty
garden
of
an
evening
amid
the
flutter
of
drying
shirts
and
towels
freehold
villas
symbolized
the
final
triumph
of
victorian
economics
the
apotheosis
of
the
prudent
and
industrious
artisan
it
corresponded
with
a
building
society
secretary
dream
of
paradise
and
indeed
it
was
a
very
real
achievement
nevertheless
hilda
irrational
contempt
would
not
admit
this
she
saw
in
freehold
villas
nothing
but
narrowness
what
long
narrow
strips
of
gardens
and
what
narrow
homes
all
flattened
together
and
uniformity
and
brickiness
and
polished
brassiness
and
righteousness
and
an
eternal
laundry
from
the
upper
floor
of
her
own
home
she
gazed
destructively
down
upon
all
that
and
into
the
chill
crimson
eye
of
the
descending
sun
her
own
home
was
not
ideal
but
it
was
better
than
all
that
it
was
one
of
the
two
middle
houses
of
a
detached
terrace
of
four
houses
built
by
her
grandfather
lessways
the
teapot
manufacturer
it
was
the
chief
of
the
four
obviously
the
habitation
of
the
proprietor
of
the
terrace
one
of
the
corner
houses
comprised
a
grocer
shop
and
this
house
had
been
robbed
of
its
just
proportion
of
garden
so
that
the
seigneurial
might
be
triflingly
larger
than
the
others
the
terrace
was
not
a
terrace
of
cottages
but
of
houses
rated
at
from
to
pounds
a
year
beyond
the
means
of
artisans
and
petty
insurance
agents
and
and
further
it
was
well
built
generously
built
and
its
architecture
though
debased
showed
some
faint
traces
of
georgian
amenity
it
was
admittedly
the
best
row
of
houses
in
that
newly
settled
quarter
of
the
town
in
coming
to
it
out
of
freehold
villas
skellorn
obviously
came
to
something
superior
wider
more
liberal
suddenly
hilda
heard
her
mother
voice
in
a
rather
startled
conversational
tone
and
then
another
woman
speaking
then
the
voices
died
away
lessways
had
evidently
opened
the
back
door
to
somebody
and
taken
her
at
once
into
the
the
occurrence
was
unusual
hilda
went
softly
out
on
to
the
landing
and
listened
but
she
could
catch
nothing
more
than
a
faint
irregular
murmur
scarcely
had
she
stationed
herself
on
the
landing
when
her
mother
burst
out
of
the
and
called
loudly
hilda
and
again
in
an
instant
very
impatiently
and
excitedly
long
before
hilda
could
possibly
have
appeared
in
response
had
she
been
in
her
bedroom
as
her
mother
supposed
her
to
be
hilda
hilda
could
see
without
being
seen
lessways
thin
wrinkled
face
bordered
by
her
untidy
but
still
black
and
glossy
hair
was
upturned
from
below
in
an
expression
of
tragic
fretfulness
it
was
the
uncontrolled
face
shamelessly
expressive
of
one
who
thinks
himself
unwatched
hilda
moved
silently
to
descend
and
then
demanded
in
a
low
tone
whose
harsh
was
a
reproof
to
that
volatile
creature
her
mother
what
the
matter
lessways
gave
a
surprised
oh
and
like
a
flash
her
features
changed
in
the
attempt
to
appear
calm
and
collected
i
was
just
coming
downstairs
said
hilda
and
to
herself
always
trying
to
pretend
i
nobody
but
when
the
least
thing
happens
out
of
the
way
she
runs
to
me
for
all
the
world
like
a
child
and
as
lessways
offered
no
reply
but
simply
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
asked
again
what
is
it
well
said
her
mother
lamentably
it
skellorn
here
grant
who
mrs
grant
hilda
inquired
with
a
touch
of
scorn
although
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
skellorn
had
a
married
daughter
of
that
name
hsh
hsh
lessways
protested
indicating
the
open
door
of
the
you
know
grant
it
seems
skellorn
has
had
a
paralytic
stroke
is
it
terrible
hilda
continued
smoothly
to
descend
the
stairs
and
followed
her
mother
into
the
chapter
ii
the
end
of
the
scene
i
the
linen
and
the
proper
to
the
last
wednesday
in
the
month
lay
on
the
green
damask
cloth
of
the
round
table
where
hilda
and
her
mother
took
their
meals
a
paralytic
stroke
had
not
been
drastic
enough
to
mar
skellorn
most
precious
reputation
for
probity
and
reliability
his
statement
of
receipts
and
expenditure
together
with
the
corresponding
cash
had
been
due
at
two
and
despite
the
paralytic
stroke
it
was
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
late
on
one
side
of
the
bag
and
the
book
were
ranged
the
older
women
lessways
thin
and
vivacious
and
grant
large
and
solemn
and
on
the
other
side
as
it
were
in
opposition
the
young
dark
slim
girl
with
her
rather
wiry
black
hair
and
her
straight
prominent
eyebrows
and
her
extraordinary
expression
of
uncompromising
aloofness
she
just
enjoying
it
that
what
she
doing
said
hilda
to
herself
of
grant
and
the
fact
was
that
grant
quite
unconsciously
did
appear
to
be
savouring
the
catastrophe
with
pleasure
although
paralytic
strokes
were
more
prevalent
at
that
period
than
now
they
constituted
even
then
a
striking
dramatic
event
moreover
they
were
considered
as
direct
visitations
of
god
also
there
was
something
mysteriously
and
agreeably
impressive
in
the
word
which
people
would
repeat
for
the
pleasure
of
repeating
it
grant
over
whose
mighty
breast
flowed
a
black
mantle
suited
to
the
occasion
used
the
word
again
and
again
as
she
narrated
afresh
for
hilda
the
history
of
the
stroke
yes
she
said
they
came
and
fetched
me
out
of
my
bed
at
three
this
morning
and
would
you
believe
me
though
he
hardly
speak
the
money
and
this
here
book
was
all
waiting
in
his
desk
and
he
would
have
me
come
with
it
and
him
he
always
was
like
that
and
i
do
believe
if
he
been
paralysed
on
both
sides
instead
of
only
all
down
his
right
side
and
speechless
too
he
ha
made
me
understand
as
i
must
come
here
at
two
if
i
a
bit
late
because
i
was
kept
at
home
with
my
son
enoch
he
got
a
whitlow
worrying
the
life
out
of
him
our
enoch
has
lessways
warmly
deprecated
any
apology
for
inexactitude
and
wiped
her
sympathetic
eyes
it
all
over
with
father
grant
resumed
doctor
hinted
to
me
as
he
never
leave
his
bed
again
he
laid
himself
down
for
the
rest
of
his
days
and
he
been
warned
he
had
warnings
but
there
grant
contemplated
with
solemn
gleeful
satisfaction
the
overwhelming
grandeur
of
the
disaster
that
had
happened
to
her
father
the
active
old
man
a
continual
figure
of
the
streets
had
been
cut
off
in
a
moment
from
the
world
and
condemned
for
life
to
a
mattress
she
sincerely
imagined
herself
to
be
filled
with
proper
grief
but
an
aesthetic
appreciation
of
the
theatrical
effectiveness
of
the
misfortune
was
certainly
stronger
in
her
than
any
other
feeling
observing
that
lessways
wept
she
also
drew
out
a
handkerchief
i
wishful
for
you
to
count
the
money
said
grant
i
like
there
to
be
any
nay
that
i
not
protested
lessways
grant
pressing
duties
necessitated
her
immediate
departure
lessways
ceremoniously
insisted
on
her
leaving
by
the
front
door
i
do
know
where
you
find
another
that
worth
his
salt
in
this
town
observed
grant
on
the
doorstep
i
think
you
do
mrs
lessways
i
shall
collect
my
rents
myself
was
the
answer
when
grant
had
crossed
the
road
and
taken
the
bricked
path
leading
to
the
paralytic
house
lessways
slowly
shut
the
door
and
bolted
it
and
then
said
to
hilda
well
my
girl
i
do
think
you
might
have
tried
to
show
just
a
little
more
feeling
they
were
close
together
in
the
narrow
lobby
of
which
the
heavy
pulse
was
the
clock
ticking
hilda
replied
you
surely
are
serious
about
collecting
those
rents
yourself
are
you
mother
serious
of
course
i
serious
said
lessways
ii
why
should
i
collect
the
rents
myself
asked
lessways
this
question
was
put
about
two
hours
later
in
the
meantime
no
remark
had
been
made
about
the
rents
mother
and
daughter
were
now
at
tea
in
the
hilda
had
passed
the
greater
part
of
those
two
hours
upstairs
in
her
bedroom
pondering
on
her
preposterous
notion
of
collecting
the
rents
herself
alone
she
would
invent
conversations
with
her
mother
silencing
the
foolish
woman
with
unanswerable
sarcastic
phrases
that
utterly
destroyed
her
illogical
arguments
she
would
repeat
these
phrases
repeat
even
entire
conversations
with
pleasure
and
dwelling
also
with
pleasure
upon
her
grievances
against
her
mother
would
gradually
arrive
at
a
state
of
resentment
she
could
if
she
chose
easily
free
her
brain
from
the
obsession
either
by
reading
or
by
a
sharp
jerk
of
volition
but
often
she
preferred
not
to
do
so
saying
to
herself
voluptuously
no
i
nurse
my
grievance
i
nurse
it
and
nurse
it
and
nurse
it
it
is
mine
and
it
is
just
and
anybody
with
any
sense
at
all
would
admit
instantly
that
i
am
absolutely
right
thus
it
was
on
this
afternoon
when
she
came
to
tea
her
face
was
formidably
expressive
nor
would
she
attempt
to
modify
the
rancour
of
those
uncompromising
features
on
the
contrary
as
soon
as
she
saw
that
her
mother
had
noticed
her
condition
she
deliberately
intensified
it
lessways
who
was
incapable
of
sustained
thought
and
who
had
completely
forgotten
and
recalled
the
subject
of
the
several
times
since
the
departure
of
grant
nevertheless
at
once
diagnosed
the
cause
of
the
trouble
and
with
her
usual
precipitancy
began
to
repulse
an
attack
which
had
not
even
been
opened
lessways
was
not
good
at
strategy
especially
in
conflicts
with
her
daughter
she
was
an
ingenuous
hasty
thing
and
much
too
candidly
human
and
not
only
was
she
deficient
in
practical
common
sense
and
most
absurdly
unable
to
learn
from
experience
but
she
had
not
even
the
wit
to
cover
her
shortcomings
by
resorting
to
the
traditional
authoritativeness
of
the
mother
her
brief
rare
efforts
to
play
the
mother
were
ludicrous
she
was
too
simply
honest
to
acquire
stature
by
standing
on
her
maternal
dignity
by
a
profound
instinct
she
wistfully
treated
everybody
as
an
equal
as
a
even
her
own
daughter
it
was
not
the
way
to
come
with
credit
out
of
the
threatened
altercation
about
as
hilda
offered
no
reply
lessways
said
reproachfully
hilda
you
too
bad
sometimes
and
then
after
a
further
silence
anyhow
i
quite
decided
then
what
the
good
of
talking
about
it
said
the
merciless
child
but
should
i
collect
the
rents
myself
i
not
asking
you
to
collect
them
and
i
shall
save
the
five
per
and
goodness
knows
we
need
it
you
more
likely
to
lose
per
said
hilda
have
some
more
tea
please
lessways
was
quite
genuinely
scandalized
you
need
think
i
shall
be
easy
with
those
calder
street
tenants
because
i
sha
not
me
i
more
likely
to
be
too
hard
you
be
too
hard
and
you
be
too
easy
too
said
hilda
savagely
you
lose
the
good
tenants
and
you
keep
the
bad
ones
and
the
houses
will
all
go
to
rack
and
ruin
and
then
you
sell
all
the
property
at
a
loss
that
how
it
will
be
and
what
shall
you
do
if
you
not
feeling
well
and
if
it
rains
on
monday
mornings
hilda
could
conceive
her
mother
forgetting
all
about
the
rents
on
monday
morning
or
putting
them
off
till
monday
afternoon
on
some
grotesque
excuse
her
fancy
heard
the
interminable
complainings
devisings
futile
resolvings
of
the
collector
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
a
woman
less
fitted
by
nature
than
her
mother
to
collect
rents
from
unthrifty
artisans
such
as
inhabited
calder
street
the
project
sickened
her
it
would
render
the
domestic
existence
an
inferno
as
for
lessways
she
was
shocked
for
her
project
had
seemed
very
beautiful
to
her
and
for
the
moment
she
was
perfectly
convinced
that
she
could
collect
rents
and
manage
property
as
well
as
anyone
she
was
convinced
that
her
habits
were
regular
her
temper
firm
and
tactful
and
her
judgment
excellent
she
was
more
than
shocked
she
was
wounded
she
wept
as
she
pushed
forward
hilda
replenished
cup
you
ought
to
take
shame
she
murmured
weakly
yet
with
certitude
why
said
hilda
feigning
simplicity
what
have
i
said
begin
you
asked
me
i
ca
help
what
i
think
it
your
tone
said
lessways
grievously
iii
despite
all
hilda
terrible
wisdom
and
sagacity
this
remark
of
the
foolish
mother
was
the
truest
word
spoken
in
the
discussion
it
was
hilda
tone
that
was
at
the
root
of
the
evil
if
hilda
with
the
intelligence
as
to
which
she
was
secretly
so
complacent
did
not
amicably
rule
her
mother
the
unavoidable
inference
was
that
she
was
either
a
clumsy
or
a
wicked
girl
or
both
she
indeed
felt
dimly
that
she
was
a
little
of
both
but
she
did
not
mind
sitting
there
in
the
small
familiar
room
close
to
the
the
steel
fender
the
tarnished
chandelier
and
all
the
other
daily
objects
which
she
at
once
detested
and
loved
sitting
close
to
her
silly
mother
who
angered
her
and
yet
in
whom
she
recognized
a
quality
that
was
mysteriously
precious
and
admirable
staring
through
the
small
window
at
the
brown
tattered
where
blackened
rhododendrons
were
swaying
in
the
october
blast
she
wilfully
bathed
herself
in
grim
gloom
and
in
an
affectation
of
despair
somehow
she
enjoyed
the
experience
she
had
only
to
tighten
her
lips
and
she
became
oblivious
of
her
clumsiness
and
her
cruelty
savouring
with
pleasure
the
pain
of
the
situation
clasping
it
to
her
now
and
then
a
thought
of
skellorn
tragedy
shot
through
her
brain
and
the
tenderness
of
pity
welled
up
from
somewhere
within
her
and
mingled
exquisitely
with
her
dark
melancholy
and
she
found
delight
in
reading
her
poor
mother
like
an
open
book
as
she
supposed
and
all
the
while
her
mother
was
dreaming
upon
the
first
year
of
hilda
life
before
she
had
discovered
that
her
husband
health
was
as
unstable
as
his
character
and
comparing
the
reality
of
the
present
with
her
early
illusions
but
the
clever
girl
was
not
clever
enough
to
read
just
that
page
we
ought
to
be
everything
to
each
other
said
lessways
pursuing
her
reflections
aloud
hilda
hated
sentimentalism
she
could
not
stand
such
talk
and
you
know
said
hilda
speaking
very
frigidly
and
with
even
more
than
her
usual
incisive
clearness
of
articulation
it
not
your
property
it
only
yours
for
life
it
my
property
the
mother
mood
changed
in
a
moment
how
do
you
know
you
never
seen
your
father
will
she
spoke
in
harsh
challenge
no
because
you
never
let
me
see
it
you
ought
to
have
more
confidence
in
your
mother
your
father
had
and
i
trustee
and
executor
lessways
was
exceedingly
jealous
of
her
legal
position
whose
importance
she
never
forgot
nor
would
consent
to
minimize
that
all
very
well
for
you
said
hilda
but
if
the
property
managed
right
i
may
find
myself
slaving
when
i
your
age
mother
and
whose
fault
will
it
be
however
i
shall
you
will
what
nothing
i
suppose
her
ladyship
will
be
consulting
her
own
lawyer
next
said
lessways
bitterly
they
looked
at
each
other
hilda
face
flushed
to
a
sombre
red
lessways
brusquely
left
the
room
then
hilda
could
hear
her
rattling
fussily
at
the
kitchen
range
after
a
few
minutes
hilda
followed
her
to
the
kitchen
which
was
now
nearly
in
darkness
the
figure
of
lessways
still
doing
nothing
whatever
with
great
vigour
at
the
range
was
dimly
visible
hilda
approached
her
and
awkwardly
touched
her
shoulder
mother
she
demanded
sharply
and
she
was
astonished
by
her
awkwardness
and
her
sharpness
is
that
you
her
mother
asked
in
a
queer
foolish
tone
they
kissed
such
a
candid
peacemaking
had
never
occurred
between
them
before
lessways
as
simple
in
forgiveness
as
in
wrath
did
not
disguise
her
pleasure
in
the
remarkable
fact
that
it
was
hilda
who
had
made
the
overture
hilda
thought
how
strange
i
am
what
is
coming
over
me
she
glanced
at
the
range
in
which
was
a
pale
gleam
of
red
and
that
gleam
in
the
heavy
twilight
seemed
to
her
to
be
inexpressibly
enchantingly
mournful
and
she
herself
was
mournful
about
the
future
very
mournful
she
saw
no
hope
yet
her
sadness
was
beautiful
to
her
and
she
was
proud
chapter
iii
cannon
i
a
little
later
hilda
came
downstairs
dressed
to
go
out
her
mother
was
lighting
a
glimmer
of
gas
in
the
lobby
ere
lessways
could
descend
from
her
tiptoes
to
her
heels
and
turn
round
hilda
said
quickly
forestalling
curiosity
i
going
to
get
that
thread
you
want
just
give
me
some
money
will
you
nobody
could
have
guessed
from
her
placid
tone
and
indifferent
demeanour
that
she
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
agitation
but
so
it
was
suddenly
after
kissing
her
mother
in
the
kitchen
she
had
formed
a
tremendous
resolve
and
in
a
moment
the
resolve
had
possessed
her
sending
her
flying
upstairs
and
burning
her
into
a
fever
as
with
the
assured
movements
of
familiarity
she
put
on
her
bonnet
mantle
and
gloves
in
the
darkness
of
the
chamber
she
held
herself
in
leash
while
her
mother
lifted
a
skirt
and
found
a
large
loaded
pocket
within
and
a
purse
in
the
pocket
and
a
sixpence
in
the
purse
but
when
she
had
shut
the
door
on
all
that
interior
haunted
by
her
mother
restlessness
when
she
was
safe
in
the
porch
and
in
the
windy
obscurity
of
the
street
she
yielded
with
voluptuous
apprehension
to
a
thrill
that
shook
her
i
might
have
tidied
my
hair
she
thought
pooh
what
does
my
hair
matter
her
mind
was
full
of
an
adventure
through
which
she
had
passed
seven
years
previously
when
she
was
thirteen
and
a
little
girl
at
school
for
several
days
then
she
had
been
ruthlessly
mortifying
her
mother
by
complaints
about
the
meals
her
fastidious
appetite
could
not
be
suited
at
last
one
noon
when
the
child
had
refused
the
whole
of
a
plenteous
dinner
lessways
had
burst
into
tears
and
slapping
four
pennies
down
on
the
table
had
cried
here
i
fairly
give
you
up
go
out
and
buy
your
own
dinner
then
perhaps
you
get
what
you
want
and
the
child
without
an
instant
hesitation
had
seized
the
coins
and
gone
out
hatless
and
bought
food
at
a
little
that
was
also
an
and
consumed
it
there
and
then
in
grim
silence
returned
home
both
mother
and
daughter
had
been
stupefied
and
frightened
by
the
boldness
of
the
daughter
initiative
by
her
amazing
flaunting
disregard
of
filial
decency
lessways
would
not
have
related
the
episode
to
anybody
upon
any
consideration
whatever
it
was
a
shameful
secret
never
even
referred
to
but
lessways
had
unmistakably
though
indirectly
referred
to
it
when
in
anger
she
had
said
to
her
daughter
aged
twenty
i
suppose
her
ladyship
will
be
consulting
her
own
lawyer
next
hilda
had
understood
and
that
was
why
she
had
blushed
and
now
as
she
turned
from
lessways
street
into
the
oldcastle
road
on
her
way
to
the
centre
of
the
town
she
experienced
almost
exactly
the
intense
excitement
of
the
reckless
and
supercilious
child
in
quest
of
its
dinner
the
only
difference
was
that
the
recent
reconciliation
had
inspired
her
with
a
certain
negligent
compassion
for
her
mother
with
a
curious
tenderness
that
caused
her
to
wonder
at
herself
ii
the
market
square
of
turnhill
was
very
large
for
the
size
of
the
town
the
diminutive
town
hall
which
in
reality
was
nothing
but
a
seemed
to
be
a
mere
incident
on
its
irregular
expanse
to
which
the
shops
and
dwellings
made
a
low
border
behind
this
crimson
border
rose
the
loftier
forms
of
a
church
and
a
large
chapel
situate
in
adjacent
streets
the
square
was
calm
and
almost
deserted
in
the
gloom
it
typified
the
slow
tranquillity
of
the
bailiwick
which
was
removed
from
the
central
life
of
the
five
towns
and
unconnected
therewith
by
even
a
tram
or
an
omnibus
only
within
recent
years
had
turnhill
got
so
much
as
a
railway
station
of
a
branch
line
turnhill
was
the
extremity
of
civilization
in
those
parts
go
northwards
out
of
this
market
square
and
you
would
soon
find
yourself
amid
the
wild
and
hilly
moorlands
sprinkled
with
villages
whose
furnaces
illustrated
the
eternal
damnation
which
was
the
chief
article
of
their
devout
religious
belief
and
in
the
market
square
not
even
the
late
edition
of

was
cried
though
it
was
discreetly
on
sale
with
its
excellent
sporting
news
in
a
few
shops
in
the
hot
and
malodorous
factories
where
the
real
strenuous
life
of
the
town
would
remain
cooped
up
for
another
of
the
evening
men
and
women
had
yet
scarcely
taken
to
they
would
gamble
upon
rabbits
cocks
pigeons
and
their
own
fists
without
the
mediation
of
the
the
one
noise
in
the
market
square
was
the
bell
of
a
hawker
selling
warm
pikelets
at
a
penny
each
for
the
high
tea
of
the
tradesmen
the
hawker
was
a
deathless
institution
a
living
proof
that
withdrawn
turnhill
would
continue
always
to
be
exactly
what
it
always
had
been
still
to
the
east
of
the
square
across
the
high
street
a
vast
space
was
being
cleared
of
hovels
for
the
erection
of
a
new
town
hall
daringly
magnificent
hilda
crossed
the
square
scorning
it
she
said
to
herself
i
better
get
the
thing
over
before
i
buy
the
thread
i
should
never
be
able
to
stand
miss
dayson
finicking
i
should
scream
out
but
the
next
instant
with
her
passion
for
proving
to
herself
how
strong
she
could
be
she
added
well
i
just
buy
the
thread
first
and
she
went
straight
into
dayson
little
fancy
shop
which
was
full
of
counter
and
cardboard
boxes
and
miss
dayson
and
stayed
therein
for
at
least
five
minutes
emerging
with
a
miraculously
achieved
leisureliness
a
few
doors
away
was
a
somewhat
new
building
of
three
storeys
the
highest
in
the
square
the
ground
floor
was
an
ironmongery
it
comprised
also
a
side
entrance
of
which
the
door
was
always
open
this
side
entrance
showed
a
karkeek
solicitor
and
the
of
the
two
windows
of
the
first
floor
also
bore
the
words
karkeek
solicitor
karkeek
solicitor
the
queerness
of
the
name
had
attracted
hilda
attention
several
years
earlier
when
the
signs
were
fresh
it
was
an
accident
that
she
had
noticed
it
she
had
not
noticed
the
or
the
of
other
solicitors
she
did
not
know
karkeek
by
sight
nor
even
whether
he
was
old
or
young
married
or
single
agreeable
or
repulsive
the
side
entrance
gave
directly
on
to
a
long
flight
of
naked
stairs
and
up
these
stairs
hilda
climbed
into
the
unknown
towards
the
redoubtable
and
the
perilous
i
bound
to
be
seen
she
said
to
herself
but
i
do
care
and
i
care
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
was
a
passage
at
right
angles
and
then
a
glazed
door
with
the
legend
in
black
letters
karkeek
solicitor
and
two
other
doors
mysteriously
labelled
private
she
opened
the
glazed
door
and
saw
a
dirty
man
on
a
stool
and
she
said
at
once
to
him
in
a
harsh
clear
deliberate
voice
without
giving
herself
time
to
reflect
i
want
to
see
mr
karkeek
the
man
stared
at
her
sourly
as
if
bewildered
she
said
to
herself
i
sha
be
able
to
stand
this
excitement
much
longer
you
ca
see
karkeek
said
the
man
karkeek
detained
at
hanbridge
county
court
but
if
you
in
such
a
hurry
like
you
better
see
cannon
it
cannon
as
they
generally
do
see
who
d
come
from
miss
come
from
hilda
repeated
unnerved
what
name
she
had
not
expected
this
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
tell
him
she
said
to
herself
and
aloud
lessways
oh
ah
exclaimed
the
man
bless
us
yes
it
was
as
if
he
had
said
of
course
it
lessways
and
do
i
know
all
about
and
hilda
was
overwhelmed
by
the
sense
of
the
enormity
of
the
folly
which
she
was
committing
the
man
swung
half
round
on
his
stool
and
seized
the
end
of
an
tube
which
hung
at
the
side
of
the
battered
and
littered
desk
just
under
a
he
spoke
low
like
a
conspirator
into
the
mouthpiece
of
the
tube
miss
lessways
to
see
you
sir
then
very
quickly
he
clapped
the
tube
to
his
ear
and
listened
and
then
he
put
it
to
his
mouth
again
and
repeated
lessways
hilda
was
agonized
i
ask
ye
to
step
this
way
miss
said
the
man
slipping
off
his
stool
at
the
same
time
he
put
a
long
inky
penholder
which
he
had
been
holding
in
his
wrinkled
right
hand
between
his
teeth
never
thought
hilda
as
she
followed
the
clerk
in
a
whirl
of
horrible
misgivings
never
have
i
done
anything
as
mad
as
this
before
i
under
iii
there
she
was
at
last
seated
in
front
of
a
lawyer
in
a
office
her
ladyship
consulting
her
own
lawyer
it
seemed
incredible
a
few
minutes
ago
she
had
been
at
home
and
now
she
was
in
a
world
unfamiliar
and
alarming
perhaps
it
was
a
pity
that
her
mother
had
unsuspectingly
put
the
scheme
into
her
head
however
the
deed
was
done
hilda
generally
acted
first
and
reflected
afterwards
she
was
frightened
but
rather
by
the
unknown
than
by
anything
she
could
define
you
come
about
the
property
said
cannon
amiably
in
a
tone
he
had
deep
black
eyes
and
black
hair
like
hilda
good
regular
teeth
and
a
clear
complexion
perhaps
his
nose
was
rather
large
but
it
was
straight
with
his
large
pale
hands
he
occasionally
stroked
his
long
soft
moustache
the
chin
was
blue
he
was
smartly
dressed
in
dark
blue
he
had
a
beautiful
and
the
genuine
whiteness
of
his
wristbands
was
remarkable
in
a
district
where
starched
linen
was
usually
either
grey
or
bluish
he
was
not
a
dandy
but
he
respected
his
person
he
evidently
gave
careful
attention
to
his
body
and
this
trait
alone
set
him
apart
among
the
citizens
of
turnhill
yes
said
hilda
she
thought
he
a
very
handsome
man
how
strange
i
do
remember
seeing
him
in
the
streets
she
was
in
awe
of
him
he
was
indefinitely
older
than
herself
and
she
felt
like
a
child
out
of
place
in
the
i
suppose
it
about
the
he
pursued
yes
it
is
she
answered
astonished
that
he
could
thus
divine
her
purpose
i
mean
what
does
your
mother
want
to
do
oh
said
hilda
speaking
low
it
not
mother
i
come
to
consult
you
myself
mother
does
know
i
nearly
and
it
really
my
property
you
know
she
blushed
with
shame
ah
he
exclaimed
he
tried
to
disguise
his
astonishment
in
an
easy
friendly
smile
but
he
was
most
obviously
startled
he
looked
at
hilda
in
a
different
way
with
a
much
intensified
curiosity
yes
she
resumed
he
now
seemed
to
her
more
like
a
and
less
like
a
member
of
the
inimical
older
generation
so
you
nearly
in
december
she
said
and
i
think
under
my
father
will
she
stopped
at
a
loss
the
fact
is
i
do
think
mother
will
be
quite
able
to
look
after
the
property
properly
and
i
afraid
you
see
now
that
skellorn
has
had
this
stroke
yes
said
cannon
i
heard
about
that
and
i
was
thinking
perhaps
lessways
had
sent
you
we
collect
rents
you
know
i
see
hilda
murmured
well
the
truth
is
mother
has
the
slightest
idea
i
here
not
the
slightest
and
i
would
hurt
her
feelings
for
anything
he
nodded
sympathetically
but
i
thought
something
ought
to
be
done
she
decided
to
collect
our
calder
street
rents
herself
and
she
is
fitted
to
do
it
and
then
there
the
question
of
the
repairs
i
know
the
rents
are
going
down
i
expect
it
all
mother
for
life
but
i
want
there
to
be
something
left
for
me
when
she
gone
you
see
and
if
i
never
seen
the
will
i
suppose
there
no
way
of
seeing
a
copy
of
it
somewhere
i
ca
very
well
ask
mother
again
i
know
all
about
the
will
said
cannon
you
do
wondrous
magical
man
yes
he
explained
i
used
to
be
at
toms
and
scoles
i
was
there
when
it
was
made
i
copied
it
really
she
felt
that
he
would
save
her
not
only
from
any
possible
unpleasant
consequences
of
her
escapade
but
also
from
suffering
ultimate
loss
by
reason
of
her
mother
foolishness
you
quite
right
he
continued
i
remember
it
perfectly
your
mother
is
what
we
call
everything
goes
to
you
in
the
end
well
hilda
asked
abruptly
all
i
want
to
know
is
what
i
can
do
of
course
without
upsetting
your
mother
he
glanced
at
her
she
blushed
again
naturally
she
said
coldly
you
say
you
think
the
property
is
going
down
it
everybody
knows
that
and
your
mother
thinks
of
collecting
the
rents
herself
well
young
lady
it
very
difficult
very
difficult
your
mother
being
the
trustee
and
executor
yes
that
what
she
always
saying
she
the
trustee
and
executor
you
better
let
me
think
it
over
for
a
day
or
two
and
shall
i
call
in
again
you
might
slip
in
if
you
passing
i
see
what
can
be
done
of
course
it
would
never
do
for
you
to
have
any
difficulty
with
your
mother
oh
no
she
concurred
vehemently
anything
would
be
better
than
that
but
i
thought
there
was
no
harm
in
me
certainly
not
she
had
a
profound
confidence
in
him
and
she
was
very
content
so
far
with
the
result
of
her
adventure
i
hope
nobody
will
find
out
i
been
here
she
said
timidly
because
if
it
get
to
mother
ears
nobody
will
find
out
he
reassured
her
assuredly
his
influence
was
tranquillizing
even
while
he
insisted
on
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
he
seemed
to
be
smoothing
them
away
she
was
convinced
that
he
would
devise
some
means
of
changing
her
mother
absurd
purpose
and
of
strengthening
her
own
position
but
when
at
the
end
of
the
interview
he
came
round
the
large
table
which
separated
them
and
she
rose
and
looked
up
at
him
close
she
was
suddenly
very
afraid
of
him
he
was
a
tall
and
muscular
man
and
he
stood
like
a
monarch
and
she
stood
like
a
child
and
his
gesture
seemed
to
say
yes
i
know
you
are
afraid
and
i
rather
like
you
to
be
afraid
but
i
am
benevolent
in
the
exercise
of
my
power
under
his
gaze
her
gaze
fastened
on
the
and
the
dark
window
and
she
read
off
the
reversed
letters
on
the
blind
like
a
mouse
she
escaped
to
the
stairs
she
was
happy
and
fearful
and
expectant
it
was
done
she
had
consulted
a
lawyer
she
was
astounded
at
herself
in
the
market
square
it
was
now
black
night
she
looked
shyly
up
at
the
lighted
over
the
ironmongery
i
was
there
she
said
he
is
still
there
the
whole
town
the
whole
future
seemed
to
be
drenched
now
in
romance
nevertheless
the
causes
of
her
immense
discontent
had
not
apparently
been
removed
nor
in
any
way
modified
chapter
iv
domesticity
invaded
i
early
in
the
afternoon
two
days
later
hilda
came
with
an
air
of
reproach
into
her
mother
empty
bedroom
lessways
had
contracted
a
severe
cold
in
the
head
a
malady
to
which
she
was
subject
and
which
she
accepted
with
fatalistic
submission
even
pleasurably
giving
herself
up
to
it
as
a
martyr
to
the
rack
lessways
colds
annoyed
hilda
who
out
of
her
wisdom
could
always
point
to
the
precise
indiscretion
which
had
caused
them
and
to
whom
the
spectacle
of
a
head
wrapped
day
and
night
in
flannel
was
offensively
ridiculous
moreover
hilda
in
these
crises
was
further
and
still
more
acutely
exasperated
by
the
pillage
of
her
handkerchiefs
although
she
possessed
a
supply
of
handkerchiefs
far
beyond
her
own
needs
she
really
hated
to
lend
to
her
mother
in
the
hour
of
necessity
she
did
lend
and
she
lent
without
spoken
protest
but
with
frigid
bitterness
her
youthful
passion
for
order
and
efficiency
was
aggrieved
by
her
mother
negligent
and
inadequate
arrangements
for
coping
with
the
inevitable
plague
she
now
made
a
to
the
bedroom
because
she
considered
that
her
mother
had
been
demanding
handkerchiefs
at
a
stage
too
early
in
the
progress
of
the
disease
impossible
that
her
mother
should
have
come
to
the
end
of
her
own
handkerchiefs
she
knew
with
all
the
certitude
of
her
omniscience
that
numerous
clean
handkerchiefs
must
be
concealed
somewhere
in
the
untidiness
of
her
mother
wardrobe
see
her
as
she
enters
the
bedroom
the
principal
bedroom
of
the
house
whose
wide
bed
and
large
wardrobe
recall
the
past
when
she
had
a
father
as
well
as
a
mother
and
when
that
bedroom
awed
her
footsteps
a
thin
girl
wearing
a
detested
but
enforced
small
black
apron
with
fine
pale
determined
features
rather
unfeminine
hair
and
glowering
challenging
black
eyes
she
had
a
very
decided
way
of
putting
down
her
uncoquettishly
shod
feet
absurdly
young
of
course
wistfully
young
she
was
undeveloped
and
did
not
even
look
nearly
you
are
at
liberty
to
smile
at
her
airs
at
that
careless
critical
glance
which
pityingly
said
ah
if
this
were
my
room
it
would
be
different
from
what
it
is
at
that
serious
worried
expression
as
if
the
anxiety
of
the
whole
world
deficiencies
oppressed
the
heart
within
and
at
that
supreme
conviction
of
wisdom
which
after
all
was
little
but
an
exaggerated
perception
of
folly
and
inconsistency
in
others
she
is
not
to
be
comprehended
on
an
acquaintance
of
three
days
years
must
go
to
the
understanding
of
her
she
did
not
understand
herself
she
was
not
even
acquainted
with
herself
why
she
was
naïve
enough
to
be
puzzled
because
she
felt
older
than
her
mother
and
younger
than
her
beautiful
girlish
complexion
simultaneously
she
opened
the
central
mirrored
door
of
the
once
formidable
wardrobe
and
as
she
did
so
the
image
of
the
bed
and
of
half
the
room
shot
across
the
swinging
glass
taking
the
place
of
her
own
reflection
and
instantly
when
she
inserted
herself
between
the
exposed
face
of
the
wardrobe
and
its
door
she
was
precipitated
into
the
most
secret
intimacy
of
her
mother
existence
there
was
the
familiar
odour
of
old
kid
gloves
she
was
more
intimate
with
her
mother
now
than
she
could
ever
be
in
talking
to
her
the
lower
part
of
this
section
of
the
wardrobe
consisted
of
three
deep
drawers
with
inset
brass
handles
an
exquisitely
exact
piece
of
mahogany
cabinetwork
from
one
of
the
drawers
a
bit
of
white
linen
untidily
protruded
her
mother
the
upper
part
was
filled
with
sliding
trays
each
having
a
raised
edge
to
keep
the
contents
from
falling
out
these
trays
were
heaped
with
her
mother
personal
belongings
small
garments
odd
indeterminate
trifles
a
muff
a
bundle
of
whalebone
veils
bags
and
especially
cardboard
boxes
quantities
of
various
cardboard
boxes
her
mother
kept
everything
could
not
bear
that
anything
which
had
once
been
useful
should
be
abandoned
or
destroyed
whereas
hilda
propensity
was
to
throw
away
with
an
impatient
gesture
whatever
threatened
to
be
an
encumbrance
sighing
she
began
to
arrange
the
contents
of
the
trays
in
some
kind
of
method
incompetent
and
careless
mother
hilda
wondered
how
the
old
thing
managed
to
conduct
her
life
from
day
to
day
with
even
a
semblance
of
the
decency
of
order
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
for
years
before
she
was
born
and
for
a
long
time
afterwards
lessways
had
contrived
to
struggle
along
through
the
world
without
her
daughter
aid
to
the
general
satisfaction
of
herself
and
some
others
at
length
ferreting
on
the
highest
shelf
but
one
she
had
the
deep
proud
satisfaction
of
the
philosopher
who
has
correctly
deduced
consequences
from
character
underneath
a
paisley
shawl
she
discovered
a
lost
treasure
of
clean
handkerchiefs
one
two
three
four
there
were
eleven
and
among
them
was
one
of
her
own
appropriated
by
her
mother
through
sheer
inexcusable
inadvertence
they
had
probably
been
lying
under
the
shawl
for
weeks
months
still
she
did
not
allow
herself
to
be
vexed
since
the
singular
hysterical
embrace
in
the
twilight
of
the
kitchen
she
had
felt
for
her
mother
a
curious
kind
forbearing
fatalistic
indulgence
mother
is
like
that
and
there
you
are
and
further
her
mood
had
been
so
changed
and
uplifted
by
excitement
and
expectation
that
she
could
not
be
genuinely
harsh
she
had
been
thrilled
by
the
audacity
of
the
visit
to
cannon
and
though
she
hoped
from
it
little
but
a
negative
advantage
she
was
experiencing
the
rare
happiness
of
adventure
she
had
slipped
out
for
a
moment
from
the
confined
and
stifling
circle
of
domestic
dailiness
she
had
scented
the
feverish
perfume
of
the
world
and
she
owed
all
this
to
herself
alone
she
meant
on
the
morrow
while
her
mother
was
marketing
to
pursue
the
enterprise
the
consciousness
of
this
intention
was
sweet
but
she
knew
not
why
it
was
sweet
she
only
knew
that
she
lived
in
the
preoccupation
of
a
dream
having
taken
two
of
the
handkerchiefs
she
shut
the
wardrobe
and
turned
the
key
she
went
first
to
her
own
small
prim
room
to
restore
stolen
property
to
its
rightful
place
and
then
she
descended
towards
the
kitchen
with
the
other
handkerchief
giving
it
to
her
mother
and
concealing
her
triumph
beneath
a
mask
of
wise
benevolence
she
would
say
i
found
ten
of
your
handkerchiefs
mother
here
one
and
her
mother
ingenuously
startled
and
pleased
would
exclaim
where
child
and
she
still
controlling
herself
as
befitted
a
superior
being
would
reply
casually
in
your
wardrobe
of
course
you
stuck
to
it
there
were
any
but
i
was
sure
there
were
ii
the
dialogue
which
actually
did
accompany
the
presentation
of
the
handkerchief
though
roughly
corresponding
to
her
rehearsal
of
it
was
lacking
in
the
dramatic
pungency
necessary
for
a
really
effective
triumph
the
reason
being
that
the
thoughts
of
both
mother
and
daughter
were
diverted
in
different
ways
from
the
handkerchief
by
the
presence
of
florrie
in
the
kitchen
florrie
was
the
new
servant
and
she
had
come
into
the
house
that
morning
sponsored
by
an
aunt
who
was
one
of
the
best
of
the
calder
street
tenants
florrie
had
been
accepted
rather
unwillingly
the
objection
to
her
being
that
she
was
too
young
thirteen
and
a
half
lessways
had
a
vague
humanitarian
sentiment
against
the
employment
of
children
as
for
hilda
feeling
it
was
at
one
moment
more
compassionate
even
than
her
mother
and
at
another
almost
cynically
indifferent
the
aunt
however
a
person
of
powerful
common
sense
had
persuaded
lessways
that
the
truest
kindness
would
be
to
give
florrie
a
trial
florrie
was
very
strong
and
she
had
been
brought
up
to
work
hard
and
she
enjoyed
working
hard
do
you
florrie
yes
aunt
with
a
delightful
smiling
whispering
timidity
she
was
the
eldest
of
a
family
of
ten
and
had
always
assisted
her
mother
in
the
management
of
a
house
and
the
nurture
of
a
regiment
of
infants
but
at
thirteen
and
a
half
a
girl
ought
to
be
earning
money
for
her
parents
bless
you
she
knew
what
a
pawnshop
was
her
father
being
often
out
of
a
job
owing
to
potter
asthma
and
she
had
some
knowledge
of
cookery
and
was
in
particular
very
good
at
boiling
potatoes
to
take
her
would
be
a
real
kindness
on
the
part
of
lessways
for
the
was
not
merely
an
easy
place
it
was
a
place
supposing
that
lessways
refused
to
have
her
well
florrie
might
go
on
to
a
and
come
to
harm
or
she
might
engage
herself
with
tradespeople
where
notoriously
the
work
was
never
finished
or
she
might
even
be
forced
into
a
her
aunt
knew
that
they
wanted
a
servant
at
the
queen
adelaide
where
the
wages
would
be
pretty
high
but
no
no
niece
of
hers
should
ever
go
into
service
at
a
if
she
could
help
it
what
with
hot
rum
and
coffee
to
be
ready
for
customers
at
five
of
a
morning
and
cleaning
up
at
nights
after
closing
a
poor
girl
would
never
see
her
bed
whereas
at
lessways
so
lessways
took
florrie
in
order
to
save
her
from
slavery
the
slim
child
was
pretty
with
graceful
and
eager
movements
and
certainly
a
rapid
comprehension
her
grey
eyes
sparkled
and
her
brown
hair
was
coquettishly
tied
up
rather
in
the
manner
of
a
horse
tail
on
may
day
she
had
arrived
all
by
herself
in
the
morning
with
a
tiny
bundle
and
she
made
a
remarkably
neat
appearance
if
you
did
not
look
at
her
boots
which
had
evidently
been
somebody
else
a
long
time
before
hilda
had
been
clearly
aware
of
a
feeling
of
pleasure
at
the
prospect
of
this
young
girl
presence
in
the
house
hilda
now
saw
her
in
another
aspect
she
wore
a
large
foul
apron
of
sacking
which
made
her
elegant
body
quite
shapeless
and
she
was
kneeling
on
the
tiled
floor
of
the
kitchen
with
her
enormous
cracked
boots
sticking
out
behind
her
at
one
side
of
her
was
a
pail
full
of
steaming
brown
water
and
in
her
red
coarse
little
hands
which
did
not
seem
to
belong
to
those
gracile
arms
she
held
a
dripping
clout
in
front
of
her
on
a
space
of
clean
shining
floor
stood
lessways
her
head
wrapped
in
a
flannel
petticoat
nearer
to
the
child
stretched
a
small
of
liquid
mud
to
the
rear
was
the
untouched
dirty
floor
florrie
was
looking
up
at
her
mistress
with
respectful
strained
attention
she
could
not
proceed
with
her
work
because
lessways
had
chosen
this
moment
to
instruct
her
with
much
snuffling
in
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
her
position
yes
mum
florrie
whispered
she
seemed
to
be
incapable
of
speaking
beyond
a
whisper
but
the
whisper
was
delicate
and
agreeable
and
perhaps
it
was
a
mysterious
sign
of
her
alleged
unusual
physical
strength
you
have
to
be
down
at
six
then
you
light
your
kitchen
fire
but
of
course
you
get
your
coal
up
first
and
then
you
do
your
boots
now
the
bacon
but
never
mind
that
either
miss
hilda
or
me
will
be
down
morning
to
show
you
yes
mum
florrie
whisper
was
grateful
when
you
got
things
going
a
bit
like
you
do
your
parlour
told
you
all
about
that
though
but
i
did
tell
you
except
on
wednesdays
on
wednesdays
you
give
your
parlour
a
thorough
breakfast
and
mind
it
got
to
be
all
straight
for
dinner
at
twelve
yes
mum
i
shall
show
you
about
your
lessways
was
continuing
to
make
everything
in
the
house
the
private
property
of
florrie
when
hilda
interrupted
her
about
the
handkerchief
and
afterwards
with
an
exhortation
to
beware
of
the
dampness
of
the
floor
which
exhortation
lessways
faintly
resented
whereupon
hilda
left
the
kitchen
it
was
always
imprudent
to
come
between
lessways
and
a
new
servant
hilda
remained
listening
in
the
lobby
to
the
interminable
and
rambling
instruction
at
length
lessways
said
benevolently
there
no
reason
why
you
should
go
to
bed
at
eight
or
nine
at
the
latest
no
reason
whatever
and
if
you
quick
and
handy
and
i
sure
you
are
you
have
plenty
of
time
in
the
afternoon
for
plain
sewing
and
darning
i
shall
see
how
you
can
darn
lessways
added
encouragingly
yes
mum
hilda
heart
revolted
less
against
her
mother
defects
as
an
organizer
than
against
the
odious
mess
of
the
whole
business
of
domesticity
she
knew
that
with
her
mother
in
the
house
florrie
would
never
get
to
bed
at
eight
and
very
seldom
at
nine
and
that
she
would
never
be
free
in
the
afternoons
she
knew
that
if
her
mother
would
only
consent
to
sit
still
and
not
interfere
the
housework
could
be
accomplished
with
half
the
labour
that
at
present
went
to
it
there
were
three
women
in
the
place
or
at
any
rate
a
woman
a
young
woman
and
a
girl
and
in
theory
the
main
preoccupation
of
all
of
them
was
this
business
of
domesticity
it
was
of
course
ridiculous
and
she
would
never
be
able
to
make
anyone
see
that
it
was
ridiculous
but
that
was
not
all
the
very
business
itself
absolutely
disgusted
her
it
disgusted
her
to
such
a
point
that
she
would
have
preferred
to
do
it
with
her
own
hands
in
secret
rather
than
see
others
do
it
openly
in
all
its
squalor
the
business
might
be
more
efficiently
organized
for
example
there
was
no
reason
why
the
should
be
made
uninhabitable
between
breakfast
and
dinner
once
a
week
but
it
could
never
be
other
than
odious
the
kitchen
floor
must
inevitably
be
washed
every
day
by
a
girl
on
her
knees
in
sackcloth
with
terrible
hands
she
was
witnessing
now
the
first
stage
in
the
progress
of
a
victim
of
the
business
of
domesticity
florrie
was
a
charming
young
creature
full
of
slender
grace
soon
she
would
be
a
dehumanized
drudge
and
hilda
could
not
stop
it
all
over
the
town
in
every
street
of
the
town
behind
all
the
nice
curtains
and
blinds
the
same
hidden
shame
was
being
enacted
a
vast
sloppy
steaming
greasy
social
horror
inevitable
it
amounted
to
barbarism
hilda
thought
in
her
revolt
she
turned
from
it
with
loathing
and
yet
nobody
else
seemed
to
turn
from
it
with
loathing
nobody
else
seemed
to
perceive
that
this
business
of
domesticity
was
not
life
itself
was
at
best
the
clumsy
external
machinery
of
life
on
the
contrary
about
half
the
adult
population
worshipped
it
as
an
exercise
sacred
and
paramount
enlarging
its
importance
and
with
positive
gusto
permitting
it
to
monopolize
their
existence
of
her
conversation
was
concerned
with
the
business
of
domesticity
and
withal
lessways
took
the
business
more
lightly
than
most
iii
there
was
an
impatient
knock
at
the
front
door
rare
phenomenon
but
not
unknown
lessways
cried
out
thickly
from
the
folds
of
her
flannel
petticoat
hilda
just
see
who
that
is
will
you
knocking
like
that
florrie
ca
come
and
just
as
hilda
reached
the
front
door
her
mother
opened
the
kitchen
door
wide
to
view
the
troublesome
disturber
and
to
inform
him
if
as
was
probable
he
was
exceeding
his
rights
that
he
would
have
done
better
to
try
the
back
door
it
was
cannon
at
the
front
door
hilda
heard
the
kitchen
door
slammed
to
behind
her
but
the
noise
was
like
a
hallucination
in
her
brain
she
was
staggered
by
the
apparition
of
cannon
in
the
porch
she
had
vaguely
wondered
what
he
might
do
to
execute
his
promise
of
aid
she
had
felt
that
time
was
running
short
if
her
mother
was
to
be
prevented
from
commencing
on
the
monday
she
had
perhaps
ingenuously
expected
from
him
some
kind
of
miracle
but
of
a
surety
she
had
never
dreamed
that
he
would
call
in
person
at
her
home
he
must
be
mad
she
would
have
exclaimed
to
herself
if
the
grandeur
of
his
image
in
her
heart
had
not
made
any
such
accusation
impossible
to
her
he
was
not
mad
he
was
merely
inscrutable
terrifyingly
so
it
was
as
if
her
adventurous
audacity
personified
had
doubled
back
on
her
and
was
exquisitely
threatening
her
good
afternoon
said
cannon
smiling
confidently
and
yet
with
ceremoniousness
is
your
mother
about
yes
hilda
did
not
know
it
but
she
was
whispering
quite
in
the
manner
of
florrie
shall
i
come
in
oh
please
do
the
words
jumped
out
of
her
mouth
all
at
once
so
anxious
was
she
to
destroy
any
impression
conceivably
made
that
she
did
not
desire
him
to
come
in
he
crossed
the
step
and
took
her
hand
with
one
gesture
she
shut
the
door
he
waited
in
suave
silence
there
was
barely
space
for
them
together
in
the
narrow
lobby
and
she
scarce
dared
look
up
at
him
he
easily
dominated
her
his
bigness
subdued
her
and
the
handsomeness
of
his
face
and
his
attire
was
like
a
moral
intimidation
he
had
a
large
physical
splendour
that
was
well
set
off
and
illustrated
by
the
brilliance
of
his
linen
and
his
broadcloth
she
was
as
modest
as
a
mouse
beside
him
the
superior
young
woman
the
stern
and
yet
indulgent
philosopher
had
utterly
vanished
and
only
a
poor
little
mouse
remained
will
you
please
come
into
the
she
murmured
when
after
an
immense
effort
to
keep
full
control
of
her
faculties
she
had
decided
where
he
must
be
put
thanks
he
said
as
she
diminished
herself
with
beautiful
shy
curves
of
her
body
against
the
wall
so
that
he
could
manoeuvre
his
bigness
through
the
doorway
he
gave
her
a
glance
half
benign
and
half
politely
malicious
which
seemed
to
say
again
i
know
you
afraid
and
i
rather
like
it
but
you
know
you
need
be
please
take
a
seat
she
implored
and
then
quickly
as
he
seemed
to
have
no
intention
of
speaking
to
her
confidentially
i
tell
mother
leaving
the
room
she
saw
him
sink
smoothly
into
a
seat
his
hat
in
one
gloved
hand
and
an
ebony
in
the
other
his
presence
had
a
disastrous
effect
on
the
chill
unfrequented
reducing
it
instantly
to
a
condition
of
paltry
shabbiness
the
kitchen
door
was
still
shut
yes
all
the
squalor
of
the
business
of
domesticity
must
be
hidden
from
this
splendid
being
hilda
went
as
a
criminal
into
the
kitchen
lessways
with
violent
movements
signalled
her
to
close
the
door
before
speaking
florrie
gazed
spellbound
upwards
at
both
of
them
the
household
was
in
a
high
fever
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
mr
cannon
lessways
excitedly
whispered
do
do
you
know
him
hilda
faltered
do
i
know
him
what
does
he
want
he
wants
to
see
you
what
about
i
suppose
it
about
property
or
something
hilda
replied
blushing
never
had
she
felt
so
abject
in
front
of
her
mother
lessways
rapidly
unpinned
the
flannel
petticoat
and
then
threw
it
with
a
desperate
gesture
of
sacrifice
on
to
the
deal
table
the
situation
had
to
be
met
the
resplendent
male
awaited
her
in
the
room
the
resplendent
male
had
his
overcoat
but
she
suffering
must
face
the
rigour
and
the
risk
unprotected
no
matter
if
she
caught
bronchitis
the
thing
had
to
be
done
even
hilda
did
not
think
of
accusing
her
mother
of
folly
lessways
having
patted
her
hair
emptied
several
handkerchiefs
from
the
twin
pockets
of
her
embroidered
black
apron
and
snatching
at
the
clean
handkerchief
furnished
by
hilda
departed
to
her
fate
she
was
certainly
startled
and
puzzled
but
she
was
not
a
whit
intimidated
and
the
perception
of
this
fact
inspired
hilda
with
a
new
reluctant
respect
for
her
mother
hilda
from
the
kitchen
heard
the
greetings
in
the
and
then
the
reverberations
of
the
sufferer
nose
she
desired
to
go
into
the
her
mother
probably
expected
her
to
go
in
but
she
dared
not
she
was
afraid
i
was
wondering
said
the
voice
of
cannon
whether
you
ever
thought
of
selling
your
calder
street
property
mrs
lessways
and
then
the
door
was
closed
and
the
ticking
of
the
clock
resumed
possession
of
the
lobby
chapter
v
lessways
shrewdness
i
waiting
irresolute
in
the
kitchen
doorway
hilda
passed
the
most
thrillingly
agreeable
moments
that
destiny
had
ever
vouchsafed
to
her
she
dwelt
on
the
mysterious
attractive
quality
of
voice
she
was
sure
that
though
in
speaking
to
her
mother
he
was
softly
persuasive
he
had
used
to
herself
a
tone
even
more
intimate
and
ingratiating
he
and
she
had
a
secret
they
were
conspirators
together
which
fact
was
both
disconcerting
and
delicious
she
recalled
their
propinquity
in
the
lobby
the
remembered
syllables
which
he
had
uttered
mingled
with
the
faint
scent
of
his
broadcloth
the
whiteness
of
his
wristbands
the
gleam
of
his
studs
the
droop
of
his
moustaches
the
downward
ray
of
his
glance
and
the
proud
nimble
carriage
of
his
great
limbs
and
formed
in
her
mind
the
image
of
an
ideal
an
image
regarded
not
with
any
tenderness
but
with
naïve
admiration
and
unquestioning
respect
and
yet
also
with
more
than
that
for
when
she
dwelt
on
his
glance
she
had
a
slight
transient
feeling
of
faintness
which
came
and
went
in
a
second
and
which
she
did
not
analyse
and
could
not
have
analysed
clouds
of
fear
sailed
in
swift
capriciousness
across
the
sky
of
her
dreaming
obscuring
it

of

of
the

of
her
adventure
and
a
fear
without
a
name
nevertheless
she
exulted
she
exulted
because
she
was
in
the
very
midst
of
her
wondrous
adventure
and
tingling
with
a
thousand
apprehensions
after
a
long
time
the
latch
of
the
door
cracked
warningly
hilda
retired
within
the
kitchen
out
of
sight
of
the
lobby
she
knew
that
the
child
in
her
would
compel
her
to
wait
like
a
child
until
the
visitor
was
gone
instead
of
issuing
forth
boldly
like
a
young
woman
but
to
florrie
the
young
mistress
with
her
stern
dark
mask
and
formidable
eyebrows
and
air
of
superb
disdain
was
as
august
as
a
goddess
florrie
moving
backwards
had
now
got
nearly
to
the
scullery
door
with
her
wringing
and
splashing
and
wiping
and
she
had
dirtied
even
her
face
as
hilda
absently
looked
at
her
she
thought
somehow
of
cannon
white
wristbands
she
saw
the
washing
and
the
ironing
of
those
wristbands
and
a
slatternly
woman
or
two
sighing
and
grumbling
amid
wreaths
of
steam
and
a
background
of
cinders
and
suds
and
sloppiness
all
that
so
that
the
grand
creature
might
have
a
rim
of
pure
white
to
his
for
a
day
it
was
inevitable
but
the
grand
creature
must
never
know
the
shame
necessary
to
his
splendour
must
be
concealed
from
him
lest
he
might
be
offended
and
this
was
woman
loyalty
her
ideas
concerning
the
business
of
domesticity
were
now
mixed
and
opposing
and
irreconcileable
and
she
began
to
suspect
that
the
bases
of
society
might
be
more
complex
and
confusing
than
in
her
youthful
downrightness
she
had
imagined
ii
well
you
got
your
way
said
lessways
with
a
certain
grim
disdainful
cheerfulness
from
which
benevolence
was
not
quite
absent
the
drastic
treatment
accorded
to
her
cold
seemed
to
have
done
it
good
at
any
rate
she
had
not
resumed
the
flannel
petticoat
and
the
nasal
symptoms
were
much
less
pronounced
got
my
way
hilda
repeated
at
a
loss
and
newly
apprehensive
mother
and
daughter
were
setting
tea
florrie
had
been
doing
very
well
but
she
was
not
yet
quite
equal
to
her
situation
and
the
mistresses
were
now
performing
her
lighter
duties
while
she
changed
from
the
offensive
drudge
to
the
neat
throughout
the
afternoon
hilda
had
avoided
her
mother
sight
partly
because
she
wanted
to
be
alone
without
knowing
why
and
partly
because
she
was
afraid
lest
cannon
as
a
member
of
the
older
generation
might
have
betrayed
her
to
her
mother
this
fear
was
not
very
genuine
though
she
pretended
that
it
was
and
enjoyed
playing
with
it
as
if
she
really
desired
a
catastrophe
for
the
outcome
of
her
adventure
she
had
only
come
downstairs
in
response
to
her
mother
direct
summons
and
instantly
on
seeing
her
she
had
known
that
cannon
was
not
a
traitor
which
knowledge
somehow
rendered
her
gay
in
spite
of
herself
so
that
what
with
this
gaiety
and
the
stimulation
produced
in
lessways
by
the
visit
of
cannon
and
the
general
household
relief
at
the
obvious
fact
that
florrie
would
rather
more
than
the
atmosphere
around
the
tinkling
in
the
was
decidedly
pleasant
nevertheless
the
singular
turn
of
lessways
phrase
you
got
your
way
had
startled
the
guilty
hilda
cannon
going
to
see
to
the
collecting
of
the
calder
street
rents
explained
lessways
so
i
hope
you
satisfied
miss
hilda
was
aware
of
yes
you
may
well
colour
up
lessways
pursued
genial
but
malicious
you
as
pleased
as
punch
and
you
saying
to
yourself
you
made
your
old
mother
give
way
to
ye
again
and
so
you
tell
me
i
thought
said
hilda
with
all
possible
prim
worldliness
i
thought
i
heard
him
saying
something
about
buying
the
property
lessways
laughed
sceptically
confidently
as
one
who
could
not
be
deceived
pooh
she
said
that
was
only
a
that
was
only
so
that
he
could
begin
his
palaver
do
tell
me
i
may
be
a
simpleton
but
i
not
such
a
simpleton
as
he
thinks
for
nor
as
some
other
folks
think
for
either
at
this
point
hilda
had
to
admit
that
in
truth
her
mother
was
not
completely
a
simpleton
in
her
mother
was
a
vein
of
perceptive
shrewdness
that
occasionally
cropped
out
and
made
all
critical
philosophy
seem
do
you
think
i
do
know
george
cannon
he
came
here
o
purpose
to
get
that
well
he
got
it
and
he
welcome
to
it
for
i
doubt
not
he
do
it
a
sight
better
than
poor
skellorn
but
he
need
hug
himself
that
he
been
too
clever
for
me
because
he
has
i
gave
him
the
because
i
thought
i
would
buy
he
no
more
got
a
good
customer
for
calder
street
than
he
got
a
good
customer
for
this
hilda
resented
this
casual
detraction
of
a
being
who
had
so
deeply
impressed
her
and
moreover
she
was
convinced
that
her
mother
secretly
very
flattered
and
delighted
by
the
visit
was
adopting
a
derisive
attitude
in
order
to
off
before
her
daughter
parents
are
thus
ingenuous
but
she
was
so
shocked
and
sneaped
that
she
found
it
more
convenient
to
say
nothing
george
cannon
could
talk
the
hind
leg
off
a
horse
lessways
continued
quite
happily
and
yet
it
is
as
if
he
said
a
great
deal
he
does
i
say
this
for
him
he
always
the
gentleman
and
i
could
say
as
much
for
his
sister
being
a
lady
and
i
sorry
for
it
he
the
most
gentlemanly
man
in
turnhill
and
always
so
spruce
too
his
sister
well
his
since
you
so
particular
miss
precise
not
miss
gailey
said
hilda
who
began
faintly
to
recall
a
forgotten
fact
of
which
she
thought
she
had
once
been
cognizant
yes
miss
gailey
lessways
snapped
still
very
genial
and
content
i
did
hear
she
quarrelled
out
and
out
with
too
at
last
she
tightened
her
lips
draw
the
blind
down
miss
gailey
a
spinster
of
superior
breeding
and
a
teacher
of
dancing
had
in
the
distant
past
been
an
intimate
friend
of
lessways
the
friendship
was
legendary
in
the
house
and
the
grand
quarrel
which
had
finally
put
an
end
to
it
dated
in
hilda
early
memories
like
a
historical
event
for
many
years
the
two
had
not
exchanged
a
word
lessways
lit
the
gas
and
the
china
and
the
white
cloth
and
the
coloured
and
the
silver
spoons
caught
the
light
and
threw
it
off
again
with
gaiety
has
she
swept
the
hearth
yes
she
has
said
lessways
glancing
round
at
the
red
fire
hilda
sat
down
to
wait
folding
her
hands
as
it
were
in
meekness
in
a
few
moments
florrie
entered
with
the
teapot
and
the
jug
the
child
wore
proudly
a
new
white
apron
that
was
a
little
too
long
for
her
and
she
smiled
happily
at
lessways
brief
compliment
on
her
appearance
and
her
briskness
she
might
have
been
in
paradise
come
in
for
your
cup
in
three
minutes
said
lessways
and
to
hilda
when
florrie
had
whispered
and
gone
now
we
shall
see
if
she
can
make
tea
i
told
her
very
particularly
this
morning
and
she
seems
quick
enough
and
when
three
minutes
had
expired
lessways
tasted
the
tea
yes
it
was
good
it
was
quite
good
undeniably
the
water
had
boiled
within
five
seconds
of
being
poured
on
the
leaves
there
was
something
this
florrie
already
she
was
exhibiting
the
mysterious
quality
of
efficiency
the
first
day
being
the
first
day
had
of
course
not
been
without
its
discouraging
moments
but
on
the
whole
florrie
had
proved
that
she
could
be
trusted
to
understand
and
to
do
things
here
an
extra
piece
of
sugar
for
you
said
lessways
beaming
as
florrie
left
the
parlour
with
her
big
full
of
steaming
tea
to
drink
with
the
thick
on
the
scrubbed
table
all
by
herself
and
do
touch
the
gas
in
the
kitchen
quite
high
enough
for
young
eyes
lessways
cried
out
after
her
little
poppet
she
murmured
to
herself
maternally
reflecting
upon
florence
tender
youth
iii
she
was
happy
was
lessways
in
her
domesticity
she
foresaw
an
immediate
future
that
would
be
tranquil
she
was
preparing
herself
to
lean
upon
the
reliability
of
florrie
as
upon
a
cushion
she
liked
the
little
poppet
and
she
liked
tea
and
pure
jelly
and
she
had
settled
the
calder
street
problem
and
incidentally
hilda
was
thereby
placated
why
should
she
not
be
happy
she
wished
for
nothing
else
and
she
was
not
a
woman
to
meet
trouble
one
of
her
greatest
qualities
was
that
she
did
not
unduly
worry
hilda
might
say
that
she
did
not
worry
enough
letting
things
go
in
spite
of
her
cold
she
yielded
with
more
gusto
than
usual
to
the
meal
and
even
said
that
if
florrie
to
shape
they
would
have
hot
toast
again
hot
toast
had
long
since
been
dropped
from
the
menu
as
an
item
too
troublesome
as
a
rule
the
meals
were
taken
hurriedly
and
negligently
like
a
religious
formality
which
has
lost
its
meaning
but
which
custom
insists
on
hilda
could
not
but
share
her
mother
satisfaction
she
could
not
entirely
escape
the
soft
influence
of
the
tranquillity
in
which
the
household
was
newly
bathed
the
domestic
existence
of
unmated
women
together
though
it
is
full
of
secret
exasperations
also
has
its
hours
of
charm
a
charm
honied
perverse
and
unique
hilda
felt
the
charm
but
she
was
suddenly
sad
and
she
again
found
pleasure
in
her
sadness
she
was
sad
because
her
adventure
was
over
over
too
soon
and
too
easily
she
thought
now
that
really
she
would
have
preferred
a
catastrophe
as
the
end
of
it
she
had
got
what
she
desired
but
she
was
no
better
off
than
she
had
been
before
the
paralytic
stroke
of
skellorn
domesticity
had
closed
in
on
her
once
more
her
secret
adventure
had
become
sterile
its
risks
were
destroyed
and
nothing
could
spring
from
it
nevertheless
it
lived
in
her
heart
after
all
it
had
been
tremendous
and
the
virtue
of
audacious
initiative
was
miraculous
yes
her
mother
was
shrewd
enough
that
could
not
be
denied
but
she
was
not
so
shrewd
as
she
imagined
for
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
and
it
never
would
occur
to
her
even
in
the
absurdest
dream
that
the
author
of
cannon
visit
was
the
girl
sitting
opposite
to
her
and
delicately
pecking
at
jelly
how
is
he
miss
gailey
hilda
demanded
through
the
meal
why
gailey
sarah
gailey
mother
that
is
married
a
foreigner
after
her
first
husband
died
but
cannon
is
a
foreigner
he
half
a
foreigner
look
at
his
eyes
surely
you
knew
all
about
that
child
no
it
was
before
your
time
hilda
then
learnt
that
gailey
had
married
a
french
modeller
named
canonges
who
had
been
brought
over
from
limoges
or
some
such
sounding
place
by
peels
at
bursley
the
great
rivals
of
mintons
and
of
copelands
and
that
in
course
of
time
the
modeller
had
informally
changed
the
name
to
cannon
because
no
one
in
the
five
towns
could
pronounce
the
true
name
rightly
and
that
george
cannon
the
son
of
the
union
had
been
left
early
an
orphan
how
did
he
come
to
be
a
solicitor
hilda
questioned
eagerly
they
say
he
is
really
a
solicitor
said
lessways
that
is
he
has
passed
his
examinations
like
but
i
dare
say
he
knows
as
much
law
as
a
lot
of
more
and
he
has
that
karkeek
to
cover
him
like
that
what
they
he
used
to
be
a
lawyer
clerk
at
toms
and
scoles
i
think
it
was
then
he
left
the
district
for
a
year
or
two
or
it
might
be
several
and
then
his
lordship
comes
back
all
of
a
sudden
and
sets
up
with
karkeek
just
like
that
can
he
talk
french
who
cannon
he
can
talk
my
word
he
can
that
eh
a
he
is
a
regular
customer
hilda
instead
of
being
seated
at
the
table
was
away
in
far
realms
of
romance
the
startling
thought
occurred
to
her
of
course
he
expect
me
to
go
and
see
him
he
done
what
i
asked
him
and
he
expect
me
to
go
and
see
him
and
talk
it
over
and
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
pay
him
something
i
forgotten
that
and
i
ought
not
to
have
forgotten
it
chapter

victor

and
isaac
pitman
i
the
next
morning
saturday
hilda
ran
no
risk
in
visiting
cannon
her
mother
cold
after
a
fictitious
improvement
had
assumed
an
aggravated
form
in
order
to
prove
that
not
with
impunity
may
nature
be
flouted
in
unheated
october
and
hilda
had
been
requested
to
go
to
market
alone
she
was
free
and
even
supposing
that
the
visit
should
be
observed
by
the
curious
nobody
would
attach
any
importance
to
it
because
everybody
would
soon
be
aware
that
cannon
had
assumed
charge
of
the
calder
street
property
past
the
brass
plates
of
karkeek
out
of
the
hubbub
of
the
she
climbed
the
long
flight
of
stairs
leading
to
the
offices
on
the
first
floor
in
one
hand
she
held
a
of
wicker
which
dangled
a
little
below
the
frilled
and
flounced
edge
of
her
blue
jacket
secure
in
the
pocket
of
her
valanced
brown
skirt
for
at
that
time
and
in
that
place
it
had
not
yet
occurred
to
any
woman
that
pockets
were
a
superfluity
a
private
lay
in
the
inmost
compartment
of
her
purse
this
coin
was
destined
to
recompense
cannon
her
free
hand
went
up
to
the
heavy
chignon
that
hung
uncertainly
beneath
her
bonnet
a
gesture
of
coquetry
which
she
told
herself
she
despised
her
face
was
a
prim
and
rather
forbidding
mask
assuredly
a
mysterious
mask
she
could
not
have
explained
her
own
feelings
she
was
still
in
the
adventure
but
the
end
of
it
was
immediate
she
had
nothing
to
hope
from
the
future
her
essential
infelicity
was
as
profound
and
as
enigmatic
as
ever
she
might
have
said
with
deliberate
and
vehement
sincerity
that
she
was
not
happy
wise
experienced
observers
studying
her
as
she
walked
her
ways
in
the
streets
might
have
said
of
her
with
sympathetically
sad
conviction
that
girl
is
not
happy
what
a
pity
it
was
so
and
yet
in
her
unhappiness
she
was
blest
she
savoured
her
unhappiness
she
drank
it
down
passionately
as
though
it
were
the
very
water
of
life
which
it
was
she
lived
to
the
utmost
in
every
moment
the
recondite
romance
of
existence
was
not
hidden
from
her
the
sudden
creation
her
creation
of
the
link
with
cannon
seemed
to
her
surpassingly
strange
and
romantic
and
in
so
regarding
it
she
had
no
ulterior
thought
whatever
she
looked
on
it
with
the
of
an
artist
looking
on
his
work
and
was
it
not
indeed
astounding
that
by
a
swift
caprice
and
stroke
of
audacity
she
should
have
changed
and
tranquillized
the
ominous
future
for
her
unsuspecting
mother
and
herself
was
it
not
absolutely
disconcerting
that
she
and
this
cannon
whom
she
had
never
known
before
and
in
whom
she
had
no
other
interest
should
bear
between
them
this
singular
secret
at
once
innocent
and
guilty
in
the
midst
of
the
whole
town
so
deaf
and
blind
ii
a
somewhat
youngish
man
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
he
was
wearing
a
silk
hat
and
a
too
ample
and
immediately
from
the
hidden
corridor
at
the
top
she
heard
the
voice
of
cannon
imperious
karkeek
the
man
stopped
hilda
wanted
to
escape
but
she
could
not
chiefly
because
her
pride
would
not
allow
she
had
to
go
on
she
went
on
frowning
the
man
vanished
back
into
the
corridor
she
could
hear
that
cannon
had
joined
him
in
conversation
she
arrived
at
the
corridor
d
miss
lessways
cannon
greeted
her
with
calm
politeness
turning
from
karkeek
who
raised
his
hat
will
you
come
this
way
one
moment
mr
karkeek
through
a
door
marked
private
cannon
introduced
hilda
straight
into
his
own
room
then
shut
the
door
on
her
he
held
in
one
hand
a
large
volume
from
which
evidently
he
was
expounding
something
to
karkeek
the
contrast
between
the
expensive
informality
of
cannon
new
suit
and
the
battered
ceremoniousness
of
karkeek
struck
her
just
as
much
as
the
contrast
between
their
demeanours
and
she
felt
vaguely
the
oddness
of
the
fact
that
the
name
of
the
deferential
karkeek
and
not
the
name
of
the
commanding
cannon
should
be
upon
the
and
the
of
the
establishment
but
of
course
she
was
not
in
a
position
to
estimate
the
full
significance
of
this
remarkable
phenomenon
further
though
she
perfectly
remembered
her
mother
observations
upon
cannon
status
they
did
not
in
the
slightest
degree
damage
him
in
her
eyes
when
once
those
eyes
had
been
set
on
him
again
they
seemed
to
her
inessential
the
essential
for
her
was
the
incontestable
natural
authority
and
dignity
of
his
bearing
she
sat
down
in
the
chair
opposite
the
chair
which
she
had
occupied
at
her
first
visit
and
thus
surveyed
across
the
large
flat
desk
all
the
ranged
documents
and
bundles
with
the
writing
thereon
upside
down
there
also
was
his
and
his
vast
inkstand
and
his
pens
and
his
thick
diary
the
disposition
of
the
things
on
the
desk
seemed
to
indicate
sharply
and
incontrovertibly
that
orderliness
that
inexorable
efficiency
which
more
than
aught
else
she
admired
in
the
external
conduct
of
life
the
spectacle
satisfied
her
soothed
her
and
seemed
to
explain
the
attractiveness
of
cannon
immediately
to
her
left
was
an
open
bookcase
almost
filled
with
heavy
volumes
the
last
of
a
uniform
row
of
law
reports
was
absent
from
its
place
being
at
that
moment
in
the
corridor
in
the
hands
of
cannon
the
next
book
a
thin
one
had
toppled
over
sideways
and
was
bridging
the
vacancy
at
an
angle
several
other
similar
thin
books
filled
up
the
remainder
of
the
shelf
she
stared
with
the
factitious
interest
of
one
who
is
very
nervously
awaiting
an
encounter
at
the
titles
and
presently
deciphered
the
words
hugo
on
each
of
the
thin
volumes
her
interest
instantly
became
real
characteristically
abrupt
and
unreflecting
she
deposited
her
basket
on
the
floor
and
going
to
the
bookcase
took
out
the
slanting
volume
its
title
was
rayons
et
les
she
opened
it
by
hazard
at
the
following
poem
which
had
no
heading
and
which
stood
a
small
triptych
of
print
rather
solitary
in
the
lower
half
of
a
large
white
page
dieu
qui
sourit
et
qui
donne
et
qui
vient
vers
qui
pourvu
que
vous
soyez
bonne
sera
content
le
monde
où
tout
étincelle
mais
ou
rien
enflammé
pourvu
que
vous
soyez
belle
sera
charmé
mon
coeur
dans
amoureuse
où
deux
beaux
yeux
pourvu
que
tu
sois
heureuse
sera
joyeux
that
was
all
but
she
shook
as
though
a
miracle
had
been
enacted
hilda
owing
partly
to
the
fondness
of
an
otherwise
stern
grandfather
and
partly
to
the
vanity
of
her
unimportant
father
had
finally
been
sent
to
a
school
attended
by
girls
who
on
the
average
were
a
little
above
herself
in
station
chetwynd
in
the
valley
between
turnhill
and
bursley
it
was
still
called
chetwynd
though
it
had
changed
hands
among
the
staff
was
a
mistress
who
was
known
as
miss
miranda
she
seemed
to
have
no
surname
one
of
miss
miranda
duties
had
been
to
teach
optional
french
and
one
of
miss
miranda
delights
had
been
to
dictate
this
very
poem
of
victor
hugo
to
her
pupils
for
learning
by
heart
it
was
miss
miranda
sole
french
poem
and
she
imposed
it
with
unfading
delight
on
the
successive
generations
whom
she
in
french
hilda
had
apparently
forgotten
most
of
her
french
but
as
she
now
read
the
poem
for
the
first
time
in
print
it
itself
in
her
memory
as
the
most
lovely
verse
that
she
had
ever
known
and
the
recitations
of
it
in
miss
miranda
small
classroom
came
back
to
her
with
an
effect
beautiful
and
tragic
and
also
there
was
the
name
of
victor
hugo
which
miss
miranda
insistent
enthusiasm
had
rendered
sublime
and
legendary
to
a
sensitive
child
hilda
now
saw
the
sacred
name
stamped
in
gold
on
a
whole
set
of
elegant
volumes
it
was
marvellous
that
she
should
have
turned
the
page
containing
just
that
poem
it
was
equally
marvellous
that
she
should
have
discovered
the
works
of
victor
hugo
in
the
office
of
cannon
but
was
it
was
he
not
and
were
not
these
books
precisely
a
corroboration
of
what
her
mother
had
told
her
cannon
origin
at
once
assumed
for
her
the
strange
seductive
hues
of
romance
he
shared
the
glory
of
victor
hugo
then
the
voices
in
the
corridor
ceased
and
with
a
decisive
movement
he
unlatched
the
door
she
relinquished
the
book
and
calmly
sat
down
as
he
entered
iii
of
course
your
mother
told
you
yes
i
had
no
difficulty
at
all
i
just
asked
her
what
she
was
going
to
do
about
the
standing
up
in
front
of
hilda
but
on
his
own
side
of
the
desk
cannon
smiled
as
a
conqueror
who
can
recount
a
triumph
with
pride
but
without
conceit
she
looked
at
him
with
naïve
admiration
to
admire
him
was
agreeable
to
her
and
she
liked
also
to
feel
unimportant
in
his
presence
but
she
fought
unsuccessfully
against
the
humiliating
idea
that
his
personal
smartness
convicted
her
of
being
shabby
of
being
even
inefficient
in
one
department
of
her
existence
and
she
could
have
wished
to
be
magnificently
dressed
lessways
is
a
very
shrewd
lady
very
shrewd
indeed
said
cannon
with
a
smile
this
time
to
indicate
humorously
that
lessways
was
not
so
easy
to
handle
as
might
be
imagined
and
that
even
the
cleverest
must
mind
their
p
and
q
with
such
a
lady
oh
yes
she
hilda
agreed
with
an
exaggerated
emphasis
that
showed
a
lack
of
conviction
indeed
she
had
never
thought
of
her
mother
as
a
shrewd
lady
cannon
continued
to
smile
in
silence
upon
the
shrewdness
of
lessways
giving
little
appreciative
movements
of
the
diaphragm
drawing
in
his
lips
and
by
consequence
pushing
out
his
cheeks
like
a
child
and
his
eyes
were
all
the
time
saying
lightly
still
i
managed
her
and
while
this
pleasant
intimate
silence
persisted
the
noises
of
the
made
themselves
prominent
quite
agreeably
in
particular
the
hard
metallic
stamping
and
slipping
on
the
bricked
pavement
under
the
window
of
a
team
of
that
were
being
turned
in
a
space
too
small
for
their
grand
free
movements
and
the
cracking
of
a
whip
again
hilda
was
impressed
mystically
by
the
strangeness
of
the
secret
relation
between
herself
and
this
splendid
effective
man
there
they
were
safe
within
the
room
almost
on
a
footing
of
familiar
friendship
the
atmosphere
was
different
from
that
of
the
first
interview
and
none
knew
and
she
alone
had
brought
it
all
about
by
a
simple
caprice
i
was
fine
and
startled
when
i
saw
you
at
our
door
mr
cannon
she
said
he
might
have
said
were
you
you
did
show
it
she
was
half
expecting
him
to
say
some
such
thing
but
he
became
reflective
and
began
well
you
see
and
then
hesitated
you
did
tell
me
you
thought
of
calling
well
he
proceeded
at
last
and
she
could
not
be
sure
whether
he
was
replying
to
her
or
not
i
was
pretty
nearly
ready
to
buy
that
calder
street
property
and
i
thought
i
talk
over
with
your
mother
first
it
just
happened
to
make
a
good
beginning
you
see
he
spoke
with
all
the
flattering
charm
of
the
confidential
hilda
flushed
under
her
mother
suggestion
she
had
been
misjudging
him
he
had
not
been
guilty
of
mere
scheming
she
was
profoundly
glad
the
act
of
apology
to
him
performed
in
her
own
mind
gave
her
a
curious
delight
i
wish
she
would
sell
said
hilda
to
whom
the
ownership
of
a
slum
was
obnoxious
very
soon
your
consent
would
be
necessary
to
any
sale
really
she
exclaimed
agreeably
flattered
but
scarcely
surprised
by
this
information
i
should
consent
quick
enough
i
ca
bear
to
walk
down
the
street
he
laughed
condescendingly
well
i
do
think
your
mother
care
to
sell
if
you
ask
me
he
sat
down
hilda
frowned
regretting
her
confession
and
resenting
his
laughter
what
will
your
charges
be
please
mr
cannon
she
demanded
abruptly
and
yet
girlishly
timid
and
at
the
same
moment
she
drew
forth
her
purse
which
she
had
been
holding
ready
in
her
hand
for
a
second
he
thought
she
was
referring
to
the
price
of
but
the
appearance
of
the
purse
explained
her
meaning
oh
there
no
charge
he
said
in
a
low
voice
seizing
a
penholder
but
i
must
pay
you
something
i
ca
no
you
must
their
glances
met
in
conflict
across
the
table
she
had
known
that
he
would
say
exactly
that
and
she
had
been
determined
to
insist
on
paying
a
fee
utterly
determined
but
she
could
not
now
withstand
the
force
of
his
will
her
glance
failed
her
she
was
disconcerted
by
the
sudden
demonstration
of
her
inferiority
she
was
distressed
and
then
a
feeling
of
faintness
and
the
gathering
of
a
mist
in
the
air
positively
frightened
her
the
mist
cleared
his
glance
seemed
to
say
with
kindness
you
see
how
much
stronger
i
am
than
you
but
you
can
trust
me
the
sense
of
adventure
grew
even
more
acute
in
her
she
marvelled
at
what
life
was
and
hid
the
purse
like
a
shame
it
very
kind
of
you
she
murmured
not
a
bit
he
said
i
got
a
job
through
this
do
forget
that
we
do
collect
rents
for
nothing
you
know
especially
calder
street
sort
of
rents
she
picked
up
her
basket
and
rose
he
also
rose
so
you
been
looking
at
my
victor
hugo
he
remarked
putting
his
right
hand
negligently
into
his
pocket
instead
of
holding
it
forth
in
adieu
iv
so
overset
was
she
by
the
dramatic
surprise
of
his
challenging
remark
and
so
enlightened
by
the
sudden
perception
of
it
being
perfectly
characteristic
of
him
that
her
manner
changed
in
an
instant
to
a
delicate
startled
timidity
all
the
complex
sensitiveness
of
her
nature
was
expressed
simultaneously
in
the
changing
tints
of
her
face
the
confusion
of
her
eyes
and
her
gestures
and
the
exquisite
hesitations
of
her
voice
as
she
told
him
about
the
coincidence
which
had
brought
back
to
her
in
his
office
the
poem
of
her
schooldays
he
came
to
the
bookcase
and
taking
out
the
volume
handled
it
carelessly
i
only
brought
these
things
here
because
they
nicely
bound
and
fill
up
the
shelf
he
said
not
much
use
in
a
lawyer
office
you
know
he
glanced
from
the
volume
to
her
and
from
her
to
the
volume
ah
miss
miranda
yes
well
it
is
so
wonderful
as
all
that
my
father
used
to
give
her
lessons
in
french
this
hugo
was
his
he
thought
a
great
deal
of
it
cannon
pose
exhibited
pride
but
it
was
obvious
that
he
did
not
share
his
father
taste
his
tone
rather
patronized
his
father
and
hugo
too
as
he
let
the
pages
of
the
book
slip
by
under
his
thumb
he
stopped
and
with
a
very
good
french
accent
quite
different
from
hilda
memory
of
miss
miranda
murmured
in
a
sort
of
chanting
qui
sourit
et
qui
that
the
very
one
cried
hilda
ah
there
you
are
then
you
see
the
bookmark
was
at
that
page
hilda
had
not
noticed
the
thin
ribbon
almost
concealed
in
the
jointure
of
the
pages
i
would
be
a
bit
astonished
if
my
father
had
lent
her
this
very
book
curious
is
it
it
was
nevertheless
hilda
felt
that
his
sense
of
the
miraculousness
of
life
was
not
so
keen
as
her
own
and
she
was
disappointed
i
suppose
you
very
fond
of
reading
he
said
no
i
not
she
replied
her
spirit
lifted
a
little
courageously
to
meet
his
with
defiance
like
a
ship
lifting
its
prow
above
the
threatening
billow
her
eyes
wavered
but
did
not
fall
before
his
really
now
i
should
have
said
you
were
a
great
reader
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
he
now
spoke
like
a
brother
confident
of
a
trustful
response
i
just
waste
my
time
she
answered
coldly
she
saw
that
he
was
puzzled
interested
and
piqued
and
that
he
was
examining
her
quite
afresh
well
he
said
shortly
after
a
pause
adopting
the
benevolent
tone
of
an
uncle
or
even
a
you
be
getting
married
one
of
these
days
i
do
want
to
get
married
she
retorted
obstinately
and
with
a
harder
glance
then
what
do
you
want
i
do
know
she
discovered
great
relief
even
pleasure
in
thus
callously
exposing
her
mind
to
a
stranger
tapping
his
teeth
with
one
thumb
he
gazed
at
her
apparently
in
meditation
upon
her
peculiar
case
at
last
he
said
i
tell
you
what
you
ought
to
do
you
ought
to
go
in
for
phonography
phonography
she
was
at
a
loss
yes
pitman
shorthand
you
know
oh
shorthand
yes
i
heard
of
it
but
why
why
it
going
to
be
the
great
thing
of
the
future
there
never
was
anything
like
it
his
voice
grew
warm
and
his
glance
scintillated
and
now
hilda
understood
her
mother
account
of
his
persuasiveness
she
felt
the
truth
of
that
odd
remark
that
he
could
talk
the
hind
leg
off
a
horse
but
does
it
lead
to
anything
she
inquired
with
her
strong
sense
of
intrinsic
values
i
should
say
it
did
he
answered
it
leads
to
everything
nothing
it
wo
lead
to
it
the
key
of
the
future
you
see
look
at
dayson
he
taken
it
up
and
now
he
giving
lessons
in
it
he
got
a
room
over
his
aunt
i
can
tell
you
he
staggered
me
he
wrote
in
shorthand
as
fast
as
ever
i
could
read
to
him
and
then
he
read
out
what
he
written
without
a
single
slip
i
having
one
of
my
chaps
taught
i
paying
for
the
lessons
i
thought
of
learning
myself
yes
really
oh
it
a
thing
that
revolutionize
all
business
and
secretarial
work
and
so
on
revolutionize
it
and
it
spreading
it
be
the
open
sesame
to
everything
anybody
that
can
write
a
hundred
and
twenty
words
a
minute
be
able
to
walk
into
any
situation
he
wants
straight
it
there
never
been
anything
like
it
look
here
it
is
he
snatched
up
a
booklet
from
the
desk
and
opened
it
before
her
she
saw
the
cryptic
characters
for
the
first
time
and
she
saw
them
with
his
glowing
eyes
in
their
mysterious
strokes
and
curves
and
dots
she
saw
romance
and
the
key
of
the
future
she
saw
the
stone
she
saw
a
new
religion
that
had
already
begun
to
work
like
leaven
in
the
town
the
revelation
was
deliciously
intoxicating
she
was
converted
as
by
lightning
she
yielded
to
the
ecstasy
of
discipleship
here
somehow
inexplicably
incomprehensively
here
was
the
answer
to
the
enigma
of
her
long
desire
and
it
was
an
answer
original
strange
distinguished
unexpected
unique
yes
and
divine
how
lovely
how
beatific
to
be
the
master
of
this
enchanted
key
it
must
be
very
interesting
she
said
low
with
the
venturesome
shyness
of
a
deer
that
is
reassured
i
do
mind
telling
you
this
cannon
went
on
with
the
fire
of
the
prophet
i
got
something
coming
along
pretty
soon
he
repeated
more
slowly
i
got
something
coming
along
pretty
soon
where
there
be
scope
for
a
young
lady
that
can
write
shorthand
i
ca
tell
you
what
it
is
but
it
something
different
from
anything
there
ever
been
in
this
town
better
his
eyes
masterfully
held
hers
seeming
to
say
i
vague
but
i
was
vague
when
i
told
you
i
see
what
could
be
done
about
your
mother
and
look
at
what
i
did
and
how
quickly
and
easily
i
did
it
when
i
vague
it
means
a
lot
and
she
entirely
understood
that
his
vagueness
was
calculated
out
of
pride
they
talked
about
dayson
a
little
i
must
go
now
said
hilda
awkwardly
i
like
you
to
take

dare
say
it
would
interest
you
remind
you
of
old
times
oh
no
you
can
return
it
when
you
like
her
features
became
apologetic
she
had
too
hastily
assumed
that
he
wished
to
force
a
gift
on
her
please
he
ejaculated
no
abuse
this
time
of
moral
authority
but
an
appeal
boyish
wistful
supplicating
it
was
irresistible
completely
irresistible
it
gave
her
an
extraordinary
sense
of
personal
power
he
wrapped
up
the
book
for
her
in
a
sheet
of
blue
draft
paper
that
noisily
crackled
while
he
was
doing
so
a
tiny
part
of
her
brain
was
as
it
were
automatically
exploring
a
box
of
old
books
in
the
attic
at
home
and
searching
therein
for
a
gasc
dictionary
which
she
had
used
at
school
and
never
thought
of
since
my
compliments
to
your
mother
he
said
at
parting
she
gazed
at
him
questioningly
oh
i
was
forgetting
he
corrected
himself
with
an
avuncular
ironic
smile
you
not
supposed
to
have
seen
me
are
you
then
she
was
outside
in
the
din
and
from
thrilling
altitudes
she
had
to
bring
her
mind
to
marketing
she

apples

arthur

though
a
very
good
shorthand
writer
and
not
without
experience
as
a
newspaper
reporter
and
was
a
nincompoop
there
could
be
no
other
explanation
of
his
bland
complacent
indifference
as
he
sat
poking
at
a
coke
stove
one
cold
night
of
january
in
full
view
of
a
most
marvellous
and
ravishing
spectacle
the
stove
was
in
a
room
on
the
floor
above
the
offices
labelled
as
karkeek
its
pipe
supported
by
wire
stays
went
straight
up
nearly
to
the
grimy
ceiling
and
then
turned
horizontally
and
disappeared
through
a
clumsy
hole
in
the
scorched
wall
it
was
a
shabby
stove
but
not
more
so
than
the
other
few
articles
of
furniture
a
large
table
a
small
desk
three
deteriorated
two
gas
brackets
and
an
old
on
its
rickety
stand
the
sole
object
that
could
emerge
brightly
from
the
ordeal
of
the
was
a
splendid
freshly
printed
blue
poster
gummed
with
to
the
wall
which
poster
bore
the
words
in
vast
capitals
of
two
sizes
five
towns
chronicle
and
turnhill
copies
of
this
poster
had
also
been
fixed
face
outwards
on
the
two
curtainless
black
windows
to
announce
to
the
market
square
what
was
afoot
in
the
top
storey
over
the
ironmonger
a
young
woman
very
soberly
attired
was
straining
at
the
double
of
the
some
have
a
screw
so
accurately
turned
and
so
well
oiled
and
handles
so
massively
like
a
that
a
touch
will
send
the
handles
whizzing
round
and
round
till
they
stop
suddenly
and
then
one
slight
wrench
more
and
the
letters
are
duly
copied
but
this
was
not
such
a
press
it
had
been
outworn
in
karkeek
office
rust
had
intensified
its
original
defects
of
design
and
it
produced
the
minimum
of
result
with
the
maximum
of
means
nevertheless
the
young
woman
loved
it
she
clenched
her
hands
and
her
teeth
and
she
frowned
as
though
she
loved
it
and
when
she
had
sufficiently
crushed
the
in
the
press
she
lovingly
unscrewed
and
drew
forth
the
book
and
with
solicitude
she
opened
the
book
on
the
smaller
table
and
tenderly
detached
the
from
the
damp
tissue
paper
and
at
last
extracted
the
copied
letter
and
examined
its
surface
smudged

murmured

i
ready
to
go
through
these
proofs
with
you
as
soon
as
you
are
he
was
over
thirty
he
had
had
affairs
with
young
women
he
reckoned
that
there
remained
little
for
him
to
learn
he
had
deliberately
watched
this
young
woman
at
the
press
he
had
clearly
seen
her
staring
under
the
at
the
copied
letter
and
yet
in
her
fierce
muscular
movements
and
in
her
bendings
and
straightenings
and
in
her
delicate
caressings
and
in
her
savage
scowlings
and
wrinklings
and
in
her
rapt
gazings
and
in
all
her
awful
absorption
he
had
quite
failed
to
perceive
the
terrible
eager
outpouring
of
a
human
soul
mighty
passionate
and
wistful
he
had
kept
his
eyes
on
her
slim
bust
and
waist
that
sprung
suddenly
neat
and
smooth
out
of
the
curving
and
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
to
exclaim
even
in
his
own
heart
with
your
girlishness
and
your
ferocity
your
intimidating
seriousness
and
your
delicious
absurdity
i
would
give
a
week
wages
just
to
take
hold
of
you
and
shake
you
no
the
dolt
had
seen
absolutely
naught
but
a
conscientious
female
beginner
learning
the
duties
of
the
post
which
he
himself
had
baptized
as
that
of
secretary
ii
hilda
was
no
longer
in
a
nameless
trouble
she
no
longer
wanted
she
knew
not
what
she
knew
beyond
all
questioning
that
she
had
found
that
which
she
had
wanted
for
nearly
a
year
she
had
had
lessons
in
phonography
from
miss
dayson
nephew
often
as
a
member
of
a
varying
and
sometimes
alone
during
the
day
she
could
not
write
shorthand
as
well
as
dayson
and
she
never
would
for
dayson
had
the
shorthand
soul
but
as
the
result
of
sustained
and
terrific
effort
she
could
write
it
pretty
well
she
had
grappled
with
isaac
pitman
as
with
apollyon
and
had
not
been
worsted
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
in
class
she
had
taken
down
at
the
rate
of
ninety
words
a
minute
dayson
purposely
difficult
political
speechifyings
which
always
contained
the
phrase
punishment
because
was
a
famous
grammalogue
but
it
was
so
dayson
watch
proved
it
about
through
the
period
of
study
she
had
learnt
from
cannon
on
one
of
his
rare
visits
to
her
mother
something
about
his
scheme
for
a
new
local
paper
she
had
at
once
divined
that
he
meant
to
offer
her
some
kind
of
a
situation
in
the
enterprise
and
she
was
right
gratitude
filled
her
lessways
being
one
of
your
women
with
an
experimental
disposition
a
disposition
to
let
things
alone
and
see
how
they
will
turn
out
had
made
little
objection
though
she
was
not
encouraging
instantly
the
newspaper
had
become
the
chief
article
of
hilda
faith
she
accepted
the
idea
of
it
as
a
nun
accepts
the
sacred
wafer
in
ecstasy
yet
she
knew
little
about
it
she
was
aware
that
cannon
meant
to
establish
it
first
as
a
weekly
and
then
when
it
had
grown
to
transform
it
into
a
daily
and
wage
war
with
that
powerful
monopolist
staffordshire
which
from
its
offices
at
hanbridge
covered
the
entire
district
the
original
title
had
been
turnhill
guardian
and
five
towns
general
chronicle
and
she
had
approved
it
but
when
cannon
with
a
view
to
the
intended
development
had
inverted
the
title
to
five
towns
chronicle
and
turnhill
she
had
enthusiastically
applauded
his
deep
wisdom
also
she
had
applauded
his
project
of
moving
later
on
to
hanbridge
the
natural
centre
of
the
five
towns
this
was
nearly
the
limit
of
her
knowledge
she
neither
knew
nor
cared
anything
about
the
resources
or
the
politics
or
the
programme
or
the
prospects
of
the
paper
to
her
all
newspapers
were
much
alike
she
did
not
even
explore
in
meditation
the
extraordinary
psychology
of
cannon
the
man
whose
original
energy
and
restless
love
of
initiative
was
leading
him
to
found
a
newspaper
on
the
top
of
a
successful
but
audaciously
irregular
practice
as
a
lawyer
she
incuriously
and
with
religious
admiration
accepted
cannon
as
she
accepted
the
idea
of
the
paper
and
being
of
course
entirely
ignorant
of
journalism
she
was
not
in
a
position
to
criticize
the
organizing
arrangements
of
the
newspaper
not
that
these
would
have
seemed
excessively
peculiar
to
anybody
familiar
with
the
haphazard
improvisations
of
minor
journalism
in
the
provinces
she
had
indeed
in
her
innocence
imagined
that
the
basic
fact
of
a
newspaper
enterprise
would
be
a
but
when
dayson
who
had
been
on
and
on
sundry
country
papers
in
shropshire
assured
her
that
the
majority
of
weekly
sheets
were
printed
on
jobbing
presses
in
private
hands
she
corrected
her
foolish
notion
her
sole
interest
but
it
was
tremendous
lay
in
what
she
herself
had
to
do
namely
take
down
from
dictation
transcribe
copy
classify
and
keep
letters
and
documents
and
occasionally
correct
proofs
all
beyond
this
was
misty
for
her
and
she
never
adjusted
her
sight
in
order
to
pierce
the
mist
save
for
her
desire
to
perfect
herself
in
her
duties
she
had
no
desire
she
was
content
in
the
dismal
dirty
untidy
untidiable
uncomfortable
office
arctic
near
the
windows
and
tropic
near
the
stove
with
dust
on
her
dress
and
ink
on
her
fingers
and
the
fumes
of
gas
in
her
quivering
nostrils
and
her
mind
strained
and
racked
by
an
exaggerated
sense
of
her
responsibilities
she
was
in
heaven
she
who
so
vehemently
objected
to
the
squalid
mess
of
the
business
of
domesticity
revelled
in
the
squalid
mess
of
this
business
she
whose
heart
would
revolt
because
florrie
work
was
never
done
was
delighted
to
wait
all
hours
on
the
convenience
of
men
who
seemed
to
be
the
very
incarnation
of
incalculable
change
and
caprice
and
what
was
she
nothing
but
a
clerk
at
a
commencing
salary
of
fifteen
shillings
per
week
ah
but
she
was
a
priestess
she
had
a
vocation
which
was
unsoiled
by
the
economic
excuse
she
was
a
pioneer
no
young
woman
had
ever
done
what
she
was
doing
she
was
the
only
girl
in
the
five
towns
who
knew
shorthand
and
in
a
fortnight
they
said
the
paper
was
to
come
out
iii
at
the
large
table
which
was
laden
with
prodigious
heterogeneous
masses
of
paper
and
general
litter
she
bent
over
the
proofs
by
side
he
had
one
proof
she
had
a
duplicate
the
copy
lay
between
them
it
was
the
rough
galley
of
a
circular
to
the
burgesses
that
they
were
correcting
together
reading
and
explaining
aloud
he
inscribed
the
cabalistic
signs
of
correction
in
the
margin
of
his
proof
and
she
faithfully
copied
them
in
the
margin
of
hers
for
practice
he
intoned
what
does
that
mean
lower
case
he
explained
grandiosely
in
the
naïve
vanity
of
his
knowledge
small
letter
not
a
capital
thank
you
she
said
and
writing
noted
in
her
striving
brain
that
case
meant
a
small
letter
instead
of
a
capital
but
she
knew
not
why
and
she
did
not
ask
the
reason
did
not
trouble
her
i
think
we
put
there
before
ring
it
will
you
ring
it
oh
i
see
yes
put
a
ring
round
the
word
in
the
margin
that
to
show
it
the
intelligent
compositor
mistake
you
see
then
there
was
a
familiar
and
masterful
footstep
on
the
stairs
and
the
attention
of
both
of
them
wavered
iv
arthur
dayson
and
his
lost
all
interest
and
all
importance
for
hilda
as
cannon
came
into
the
room
the
unconscious
expressive
gesture
scornful
and
abrupt
with
which
she
neglected
them
might
have
been
terribly
wounding
to
a
young
man
more
sensitive
than
dayson
but
dayson
in
his
mediocrity
had
the
hide
of
an
alligator
he
even
judged
her
movement
quite
natural
for
he
was
a
flunkey
born
hilda
gazed
at
her
master
with
anxiety
as
he
deposited
his
black
in
the
corner
behind
the
door
and
loosed
his
white
muffler
and
large
overcoat
which
dayson
called
an
she
thought
the
master
looked
tired
and
worried
supposing
he
fell
ill
at
this
supreme
juncture
the
whole
enterprise
would
be
scotched
and
not
forty
daysons
could
keep
it
going
the
master
was
doing
too
much
law
by
day
and
journalism
by
night
they
were
perhaps
all
doing
too
much
but
the
others
did
not
matter
nevertheless
cannon
advanced
to
the
table
buoyant
and
faintly
smiling
straightening
his
shoulders
back
proudly
proving
to
himself
and
to
them
that
his
individual
force
was
inexhaustible
that
straightening
of
the
shoulders
always
affected
hilda
as
something
wistful
as
almost
pathetic
in
its
confident
boyishness
it
made
her
feel
maternal
and
say
to
herself
but
not
in
words
with
a
sort
of
maternal
superiority
how
brave
he
is
poor
thing
yes
in
her
heart
she
would
apply
the
epithet
thing
to
this
grand
creature
whose
superiority
she
acknowledged
with
more
fervour
than
anybody
as
for
the
undaunted
straightening
of
the
shoulders
she
adopted
it
and
after
a
time
it
grew
to
be
a
characteristic
gesture
with
her
well
cannon
greeted
them
well
said
arthur
dayson
with
a
factitious
air
of
treating
him
as
an
equal
i
been
round
to

and
made
it
clear
to
him
that
if

in

to

into

she
said

diffidently

if
you
like
me
to
do
it
again
you
see
it
plethora
of
dayson
put
in
indulgent
oh
no
cannon
decided
having
read
the
letter
he
gave
it
to
dayson
it
does
matter
but
you
ought
to
have
signed
it
before
it
was
copied
in
the
gemini
miss
murmured
dayson
glancing
at
hilda
with
uplifted
brows
the
fact
was
that
both
of
them
had
forgotten
this
formality
dayson
took
a
pen
and
after
describing
a
few
flourishes
in
the
air
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
above
the
level
of
the
paper
he
magnificently
signed
dayson
such
was
the
title
of
the
proprietorship
just
as
karkeek
was
cannon
dummy
in
the
law
so
was
dayson
in
the
newspaper
business
but
whereas
karkeek
was
privately
ashamed
dayson
was
proud
of
his
rôle
which
gave
him
the
illusion
of
power
and
glory
just
take
this
down
will
you
said
cannon
hilda
grasped
at
her
notebook
and
seized
a
pencil
and
then
held
herself
tense
to
receive
the
message
staring
downwards
at
the
blank
page
dayson
lolled
in
his
chair
throwing
his
head
back
he
knew
that
the
presence
of
himself
the
great
shorthand
expert
made
hilda
nervous
when
she
had
to
write
from
dictation
and
this
flattered
his
simple
vanity
hilda
hated
and
condemned
her
nervousness
but
she
could
not
conquer
it
cannon
standing
over
the
table
pushed
his
hat
away
from
his
broad
shining
forehead
and
then
meditative
absently
lifted
higher
his
carefully
tended
hand
and
lowered
the
singing
only
to
raise
it

is
waiting
for
that
letter
to
brunt
said
arthur
dayson
emerging
from
the
inner
room
a
little
later
in
one
moment
hilda
replied
coldly
though
she
had
not
begun
to
write
the
letter
dayson
disappeared
nodding
she
resented
his
referring
to
cannon
as
friend
but
she
did
not
know
why
unless
it
was
that
she
vaguely
regarded
it
as
presumptuous
or
in
the
alternative
if
he
meant
to
be
facetious
as
on
the
part
of
arthur
dayson
she
chose
a
sheet
of
paper
and
wrote
the
letter
in
longhand
as
quickly
as
she
could
but
with
arduous
care
in
the
formation
of
every
character
she
wrote
with
the
whole
of
her
faculties
fully
applied
even
in
the
smallest
task
she
could
not
economize
herself
she
had
to
give
all
or
nothing
when
she
came
to
the
figures
she
intensified
her
ardour
lavishing
enormous
unnecessary
force
it
was
like
a
steamhammer
cracking
a
nut
her
conscience
had
instantly
and
finally
decided
against
her
but
she
ignored
her
conscience
she
knew
and
owned
that
she
was
wrong
to
abet
cannon
deception
and
she
abetted
it
she
would
have
abetted
it
if
she
had
believed
that
the
act
would
involve
her
in
everlasting
damnation
not
solely
out
of
loyalty
to
cannon
only
a
little
out
of
loyalty
chiefly
out
of
mere
unreasoning
pride
and
obstinate
adherence
to
a
decision
the
letter
finished
she
took
it
into
the
inner
room
where
the
three
men
sat
in
mysterious
conclave
cannon
read
it
over
and
then
arthur
dayson
borrowed
the
old
clerk
vile
pen
and
with
the
ceremonious
delays
due
to
his
sense
of
his
own
importance
flourishingly
added
the
signature
when
she
came
forth
she
heard
a
knock
at
the
outer
door
come
in
she
commanded
defiantly
for
she
was
still
unconsciously
in
the
defiant
mood
in
which
she
had
offered
the
lying
letter
to
cannon
ii
a
and
almost
beautiful
young
woman
of
about
the
same
age
as
hilda
opened
the
door
with
a
charming
gesture
of
diffidence
for
a
second
the
two
gazed
at
each
other
astounded
well
hilda
of
all
the
janet
it
was
an
old
schoolfellow
janet
orgreave
daughter
of
osmond
orgreave
a
successful
architect
at
bursley
janet
had
passed
part
of
her
schooldays
at
chetwynd
and
with
her
brother
charlie
she
had
also
attended
sarah
gailey
private
famous
throughout
turnhill
bursley
and
hanbridge
at
the
same
time
as
hilda
she
was
known
she
was
almost
notorious
as
a
universal
favourite
by
instinct
without
taking
thought
she
pleased
everybody
great
and
small
nature
had
spoiled
her
endowing
her
with
some
beauty
and
undeniable
elegance
and
abundant
sincere
kindliness
she
had
only
to
smile
and
she
made
a
friend
it
cost
her
nothing
she
smiled
now
and
produced
the
illusion
not
merely
in
hilda
but
in
herself
also
that
her
pleasure
in
this
very
astonishing
encounter
was
quite
peculiarly
poignant
they
shook
hands
as
women
of
the
world
did
you
know
i
was
here
hilda
questioned
characteristically
on
her
guard
with
a
nervous
girlish
movement
of
the
leg
that
perhaps
sinned
against
the
code
of
authentic
worldliness
no
indeed
exclaimed
janet
well
i
am
i
engaged
here
how
splendid
of
you
said
janet
enthusiastically
with
no
suggestion
whatever
in
her
tone
that
hilda
situation
was
odd
or
of
dubious
propriety
or
aught
but
enviable
but
hilda
surveyed
her
with
secret
envy
transient
yet
real
in
the
years
that
had
passed
since
the
days
of
the
janet
had
matured
she
was
now
the
finished
product
she
had
the
charm
of
her
sex
and
she
depended
on
it
she
had
grace
and
an
overflowing
goodness
she
had
a
smooth
ease
of
manner
she
was
dignified
and
with
her
furs
and
her
expensive
veil
protecting
those
bright
cheeks
and
all
the
studied
minor
details
of
her
costume
she
was
admirably
and
luxuriously
attired
she
was
the
usual
as
distinguished
from
the
unusual
woman
brought
to
perfection
she
represented
no
revolt
against
established
custom
doubts
and
longings
did
not
beset
her
she
was
content
within
her
sphere
a
destined
queen
of
the
home
and
yet
she
could
not
be
accused
of
being
none
would
dare
to
despise
her
she
was
what
hilda
could
never
be
had
never
long
desired
to
be
she
was
what
hilda
had
definitely
renounced
being
and
there
stood
hilda
immature
graceless
harsh
inelegant
dowdy
holding
the
letter
between
her
inky
fingers
in
the
midst
of
all
that
hard
masculine
mess
and
a
part
of
it
the
blindly
devoted
subaltern
who
could
expect
none
of
the
ritual
of
homage
given
to
women
who
must
sit
and
work
and
stand
and
strain
and
say
and
pretend
stiffly
that
she
was
a
sound
serviceable
imitation
man
among
men
if
hilda
had
been
a
valkyrie
or
a
saint
she
might
have
felt
no
envy
and
no
pang
but
she
was
a
woman
shot
through
her
tremendous
pride
and
the
lancinating
stab
made
her
inattentive
even
to
her
curiosity
concerning
the
purpose
of
janet
visit
iii
i
came
to
see
cannon
said
janet
the
housekeeper
downstairs
told
me
he
was
here
somewhere
he
engaged
answered
hilda
in
a
low
voice
with
the
instinct
to
surround
her
superior
with
mystery
oh
murmured
janet
checked
hilda
wondered
furiously
what
she
could
be
wanting
with
cannon
janet
recommenced
it
really
about
miss
gailey
you
know
yes
what
hilda
nodded
eagerly
speaking
in
a
tone
still
lower
and
more
careful
janet
dropped
her
voice
accordingly
she
cannon
sister
of
course
i
mean
i
just
come
away
from
seeing
her
she
hesitated
i
only
heard
by
accident
so
i
came
over
with
father
he
had
to
come
to
a
meeting
of
the
guardians
here
or
something
they
quarrelled
they
who
miss
gailey
and
cannon
well
you
see
she
quarrels
with
every
one
hilda
appeared
to
defend
cannon
i
afraid
she
does
poor
thing
she
quarrelled
with
mother
really
when
was
that
oh
years
and
years
ago
i
do
know
when
i
was
always
surprised
mother
let
me
go
to
the
class
it
was
very
nice
of
your
mother
said
janet
appreciative
is
she
in
trouble
hilda
asked
bluntly
i
afraid
she
is
what
janet
suddenly
gave
a
gesture
of
intimacy
i
believe
she
starving
starving
hilda
repeated
in
a
blank
whisper
yes
i
do
i
do
really
believe
she
has
got
enough
to
eat
quarrelled
with
just
about
everybody
there
was
to
quarrel
with
she
suffers
fearfully
with
rheumatism
she
never
goes
out
or
scarcely
ever
you
know
her
have
all
fallen
away
to
nothing
i
fancy
she
tried
taking
lodgers
yes
she
did
i
understood
she
was
very
good
at
housekeeping
she
has
got
any
lodgers
now
there
she
is
all
alone
in
that
house
and
but
she
ca
be
hilda
protested
at
intervals
she
glanced
at
the
inner
door
alarmed
i
really
think
she
is
janet
persisted
softly
persuasive
but
what
to
be
done
that
the
point
i
just
seen
her
i
went
on
purpose
because
heard
but
i
had
to
pretend
all
sorts
of
things
to
make
an
excuse
for
myself
i
could
offer
her
anything
could
i
is
it
dreadful
they
were
much
worried
these
two
young
maids
full
of
health
and
vigour
and
faith
and
pride
and
simplicity
by
this
startling
first
glimpse
into
one
of
the
nether
realities
of
existence
and
they
loyally
tried
to
feel
more
worried
than
they
actually
were
they
did
their
best
out
of
sympathy
to
moderate
the
leaping
joyous
vitality
that
was
in
them
and
did
not
succeed
very
well
they
were
fine
they
were
touching
but
they
were
also
rather
deliciously
amusing
as
they
concentrated
all
their
resources
of
solemnity
and
of
worldly
experience
on
the
tragic
case
of
the
woman
whom
life
had
defeated
hilda
memory
rushed
strangely
to
victor
hugo
she
was
experiencing
the
same
utter
desolation
but
somehow
less
noble
as
had
gripped
her
when
she
first
realized
the
eternal
picture
in
of
the
widows
who
tired
of
waiting
for
those
whose
barque
had
never
returned
out
of
the
tempest
talked
quietly
among
themselves
of
the
lost
stirring
the
cinders
in
the
fireplace
and
in
their
hearts
yet
sarah
gailey
was
not
even
a
widow
she
was
an
ageing
she
had
once
taught
the
grace
of
rhythmic
movement
to
young
limbs
and
now
she
was
rheumatic
nobody
but
cannon
can
do
anything
janet
murmured
i
sure
he
has
the
slightest
idea
not
the
slightest
said
hilda
half
defensively
but
she
was
saying
to
herself
this
man
made
me
write
a
lie
and
now
i
hear
that
his
sister
is
starving
in
the
same
town
and
she
thought
of
his
glossy
opulence
i
quite
sure
of
she
repeated
to
janet
oh
so
am
i
janet
eagerly
concurred
that
why
i
came
somebody
had
to
give
him
a
hint
i
never
dreamt
of
finding
you
dear
it
is
strange
is
it
said
hilda
the
wondrous
romance
of
things
seizing
her
seen
afresh
through
the
eyes
of
this
charming
sympathetic
acquaintance
was
not
cannon
originality
in
engaging
her
positively
astounding
i
suppose
could
give
him
a
hint
yes
i
tell
him
said
hilda
of
course
in
spite
of
herself
she
was
assuming
a
certain
proprietorship
in
cannon
i
so
glad
janet
replied
it
is
good
of
you
it
seems
to
me
it
you
that
good
janet
hilda
said
grimly
she
thought
should
out
of
simple
kindliness
and
charity
have
deliberately
come
to
tell
a
man
i
did
know
that
his
sister
was
starving
never
he
bound
to
see
after
it
said
janet
content
why
of
course
said
hilda
clinching
the
affair
in
an
intimate
confidential
murmur
you
tell
him
hilda
nodded
they
exchanged
a
grave
glance
of
mutual
appreciation
and
understanding
each
was
sure
of
the
other
high
esteem
each
was
glad
that
chance
had
brought
about
the
meeting
between
them
then
they
lifted
away
their
apprehensive
solicitude
for
sarah
gailey
and
janet
having
sighed
relief
began
to
talk
about
old
times
and
their
voices
grew
louder
and
more
free
can
you
tell
me
what
time
it
is
janet
asked
later
i
broken
the
spring
of
my
watch
and
i
have
to
meet
father
at
the
station
at
i
have
a
notion
said
hilda
rather
ashamed
i
hope
it
is
ten
i
could
ask
said
hilda
hesitatingly
the
hour
for
aught
she
knew
was
nine
eleven
or
even
midnight
she
was
oblivious
of
time
i
run
said
janet
preparing
to
go
i
shall
tell
charlie
i
seen
you
next
time
i
write
to
him
i
sure
he
be
glad
and
you
must
come
to
see
us
you
really
must
now
mother
and
father
will
be
delighted
do
you
still
recite
like
you
used
to
hilda
shook
her
head
blushing
she
made
no
definite
response
to
the
invitation
which
surprised
agitated
and
flattered
her
she
wanted
to
accept
it
but
she
was
convinced
that
she
never
would
accept
it
before
departing
janet
lifted
her
veil
with
a
beautiful
gesture
and
offered
her
lips
to
kiss
they
embraced
affectionately
the
next
moment
hilda
at
the
top
of
the
dim
naked
resounding
stair
was
watching
janet
descend
a
figure
infinitely
stylish
and
agreeable
to
the
eye
chapter
ix
in
the
street
i
a
few
minutes
later
just
as
hilda
had
sealed
up
the
last
of
the
letters
cannon
issued
somewhat
hurriedly
out
of
the
inner
room
buttoning
his
overcoat
at
the
neck
good
night
he
said
and
took
his
stick
from
the
corner
where
he
had
placed
it
mr
cannon
well
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
what
is
it
i
in
a
hurry
she
glanced
at
the
inner
door
which
he
had
left
open
from
beyond
that
door
came
the
voices
of
arthur
dayson
and
the
old
clerk
hilda
lacked
the
courage
to
cross
the
length
of
the
room
and
deliberately
close
it
and
though
cannon
did
not
seem
inclined
to
move
his
eyes
followed
the
direction
of
hers
and
he
must
have
divined
her
embarrassment
she
knew
not
what
to
do
a
crisis
seemed
to
rise
up
monstrous
between
them
in
an
instant
she
was
trembling
and
in
acute
trouble
it
rather
important
she
said
timidly
but
not
without
an
unintentional
violence
well
afternoon
he
too
was
apparently
in
a
fractious
state
the
situation
was
perhaps
perilous
but
she
could
not
allow
her
conduct
to
be
influenced
by
danger
or
difficulty
which
indeed
nearly
always
had
the
effect
of
confirming
her
purpose
if
something
had
to
be
done
it
had
to
be
done
and
let
that
suffice
he
waited
impatient
for
her
to
agree
and
allow
him
to
go
no
she
answered
with
positive
resentment
in
her
clear
voice
i
must
speak
to
you
it
very
important
he
made
with
his
tongue
an
inarticulate
noise
of
controlled
exasperation
if
you
finished
put
your
things
on
and
walk
along
with
me
he
said
she
hurried
to
obey
and
overtook
him
as
he
slowly
descended
the
lower
flight
of
stairs
she
had
buttoned
her
jacket
and
knotted
her
thick
scarf
and
now
with
the
letters
pressed
tightly
under
her
arm
lest
they
should
fall
she
was
pulling
on
her
gloves
i
have
an
appointment
at
the
saracen
he
said
mildly
meaning
the
saracen
head
the
central
rendezvous
of
the
town
where
conservative
and
liberal
met
on
neutral
ground
ii
he
turned
to
the
left
toward
the
high
street
and
the
great
cleared
space
out
of
which
the
cellarage
of
the
new
town
hall
had
already
been
scooped
he
carried
his
thick
gloves
in
his
white
and
elegant
hand
as
one
who
did
not
feel
the
frost
she
stepped
after
him
their
breaths
whitened
the
keen
air
she
was
extremely
afraid
and
considered
herself
an
abject
coward
but
she
was
determined
to
the
point
of
desperation
he
ought
to
know
the
truth
and
he
ought
to
know
it
at
once
nothing
else
mattered
she
reflected
in
her
terror
if
i
do
begin
right
off
he
will
be
asking
me
to
begin
and
that
will
be
worse
than
ever
she
was
like
one
who
having
boastfully
undertaken
to
plunge
into
deep
cold
water
from
a
height
has
climbed
to
the
height
and
measured
the
fearful
distance
and
is
sick
and
dares
not
leap
but
knows
that
he
must
leap
i
suppose
you
know
miss
gailey
is
practically
starving
she
said
abruptly
harshly
staring
at
the
gutter
she
had
leapt
life
seemed
to
leave
her
she
had
not
intended
to
use
such
words
nor
such
a
tone
she
certainly
did
not
suppose
that
he
knew
about
miss
gailey
condition
she
had
affirmed
to
janet
orgreave
her
absolute
assurance
that
he
did
not
know
as
for
the
tone
it
was
accusing
it
was
brutal
it
was
full
of
the
unconscious
and
terrible
clumsy
cruelty
of
youth
what
his
head
moved
sharply
sideways
to
look
at
her
miss
gailey
she
starving
it
seems
hilda
said
timidly
now
almost
apologetically
i
felt
sure
you
did
know
i
thought
one
should
tell
you
what
do
you
mean
starving
he
asked
gruffly
not
enough
to
eat
she
replied
with
the
direct
simplicity
of
a
child
and
how
did
this
tale
get
about
it
true
she
said
i
was
told
who
told
you
a
friend
of
mine
who
seen
her
but
who
it
would
be
right
for
me
to
tell
you
who
they
walked
on
in
an
appalling
silence
to
the
corner
of
the
square
and
the
high
street
here
the
he
said
stopping
she
dropped
the
letters
with
nervous
haste
into
the
box
then
she
looked
up
at
him
appealingly
in
the
brightness
of
the
starry
night
she
saw
that
his
face
had
a
sardonic
meditative
smile
the
middle
part
of
the
lower
lip
was
pushed
out
while
the
corners
were
pulled
down
an
expression
of
scornful
disgust
she
burst
out
of
course
i
know
very
well
it
not
your
fault
i
know
if
but
what
with
her
never
seeing
you
and
perhaps
people
not
caring
to
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
he
interrupted
her
quietly
still
meditative
he
was
evidently
sincere
his
attitude
was
dignified
many
men
would
have
been
ashamed
humiliated
even
though
aware
of
innocence
but
he
contrived
to
rise
above
such
weakness
she
was
glad
she
admired
him
and
she
was
very
glad
also
that
he
did
not
deign
to
asseverate
that
he
had
been
ignorant
of
his
plight
naturally
he
had
been
ignorant
iii
she
was
suddenly
happy
she
was
inspired
by
an
unreasoning
joy
she
was
happy
because
she
was
so
young
and
fragile
and
inexperienced
and
he
so
much
older
and
more
powerful
and
more
capable
she
was
happy
because
she
was
a
mere
girl
and
he
a
mature
and
important
male
she
thought
their
relation
in
that
moment
exquisitely
beautiful
she
was
happy
because
she
had
been
exceedingly
afraid
and
the
fear
had
gone
the
dark
square
and
streets
lay
placid
and
void
under
the
night
surrounding
their
silence
in
a
larger
silence
and
because
of
that
also
she
was
happy
a
policeman
with
his
arms
hidden
under
his
cloak
marched
unhasting
downwards
from
the
direction
of
the
bank
fine
night
officer
said
cannon
cordially
yes
sir
good
night
sir
the
policeman
responded
with
respect
and
sturdy
his
footsteps
ringing
onwards
and
the
sight
and
bearing
of
this
hardy
policeman
watching
over
the
town
and
the
greetings
between
him
and
cannon
these
too
seemed
strangely
beautiful
to
hilda
and
then
a
train
reverberated
along
its
embankment
in
the
distance
and
the
gliding
procession
of
yellow
windows
was
divided
at
regular
intervals
by
the
black
silhouettes
of
the
of
the
new
town
hall
beautiful
she
was
filled
with
a
delicious
sadness
it
was
train
in
some
compartment
janet
and
her
father
were
shut
together
side
by
side
intimate
mutually
understanding
again
a
beautiful
relation
from
the
summit
of
a
high
kiln
in
the
middle
distance
flames
shot
intermittently
forth
formidable
crockery
was
being
fired
in
the
night
and
unseen
the
fireman
somewhere
flitted
about
the
mouths
of
the
kiln
and
here
and
there
in
the
dim
faces
of
the
streets
a
window
shone
golden
there
were
living
people
behind
the
blind
it
was
all
beautiful
the
thought
of
her
mother
fidgeting
for
her
return
home
was
delightful
the
thought
of
cannon
and
miss
gailey
separated
during
many
years
and
now
destined
to
some
kind
of
reconciliation
was
indescribably
touching
and
beautiful
in
a
way
that
she
could
not
define
i
was
only
thinking
the
other
day
said
cannon
treating
her
as
an
equal
in
years
and
wisdom
i
was
only
thinking
i
got
the
very
thing
for
my
the
very
opening
for
her
a
chance
in
a
thousand
if
only
she
it
was
unnecessary
for
him
to
finish
the
sentence
and
is
it
too
late
now
hilda
asked
eagerly
no
he
said
it
is
too
late
i
shall
go
round
and
see
her
morning
first
thing
it
would
do
for
me
to
go
you
see
might
seem
too
odd
yes
hilda
murmured
well
good
night
they
separated
she
knew
that
he
was
profoundly
stirred
nevertheless
he
had
inquired
for
no
further
details
concerning
miss
gailey
he
was
too
proud
and
beneath
his
inflexibility
too
sensitive
to
do
so
he
meant
to
discover
the
truth
for
himself
he
had
believed
that
was
the
essential
his
behaviour
had
been
superb
the
lying
letter
to
ezra
brunt
was
a
mere
peccadillo
even
if
it
was
that
even
if
it
was
not
actually
virtuous
she
walked
off
rapidly
trying
to
imitate
the
fine
free
calmly
defiant
bearing
of
cannon
and
the
policeman
iv
florrie
gone
to
bed
she
asked
briskly
of
her
mother
who
was
fussing
about
her
in
the
parlour
pretending
to
be
fretful
but
secretly
enchanted
to
welcome
her
with
a
warm
fire
and
plenteous
food
back
again
into
the
house
and
hilda
too
was
enchanted
at
her
reception
florrie
gone
to
bed
i
should
just
think
florrie
has
gone
to
bed
ten
and
after
eh
my
this
going
out
after
tea
i
never
heard
of
such
doings
now
do
warm
your
feet
i
should
have
been
home
sooner
only
something
happened
said
hilda
oh
lessways
exclaimed
indifferently
she
had
in
fact
no
curiosity
as
to
the
affairs
of
dayson
and
company
the
sole
thing
that
interested
her
was
hilda
daily
absence
and
daily
return
she
seemed
quite
content
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
what
hilda
did
in
the
mysterious
office
her
conversation
profuse
when
she
was
in
good
spirits
rarely
went
beyond
the
trifling
separate
events
of
existence
personal
and
domestic
the
life
of
the
house
hour
by
hour
and
minute
by
minute
it
was
often
astounding
to
hilda
that
her
mother
never
showed
any
sign
of
being
weary
of
these
topics
nor
any
desire
to
discover
other
topics
yes
said
hilda
miss
gailey
lessways
became
instantly
a
different
creature
and
does
he
know
she
asked
blankly
when
hilda
had
informed
her
of
janet
visit
and
news
yes
i
told
him
of
course
you
well
somebody
had
to
tell
him
said
hilda
with
an
affectation
of
carelessness
so
i
told
him
myself
and
how
did
he
take
it
well
how
should
he
take
it
hilda
retorted
largely
he
to
take
it
he
was
much
obliged
and
he
said
so
lessways
began
to
weep
what
ever
the
matter
i
was
only
thinking
of
poor
sarah
lessways
answered
the
implied
rebuke
of
hilda
brusque
question
i
shall
go
and
see
her
morning
but
mother
do
you
think
you
better
wait
lessways
spoke
up
resolutely
i
shall
go
and
see
sarah
gailey
morning
and
let
that
be
understood
i
do
need
my
daughter
to
teach
me
when
i
ought
to
go
and
see
my
friends
and
when
i
ought
i
knew
sarah
gailey
before
your
cannon
was
born
oh
very
well
very
well
hilda
soothed
her
lightly
i
shall
tell
sarah
gailey
she
got
to
reckon
with
me
whether
she
wants
to
or
not
that
what
i
shall
tell
sarah
gailey
lessways
wiped
her
eyes
mother
hilda
asked
when
they
had
gone
upstairs
did
you
wind
the
clock
i
do
think
i
did
answered
the
culprit
uncertainly
from
her
bedroom
door
mother
how
tiresome
you
are
night
before
last
you
would
let
me
touch
it
you
said
you
preferred
to
do
it
yourself
and
now
i
shall
be
waiting
for
it
to
strike
morning
to
get
up
lend
me
that
candle
do
she
tripped
down
to
the
lobby
gladly
and
opened
the
big
door
of
the
clock
and
put
her
hand
into
the
dark
cavity
and
grimacing
hauled
up
the
heavy
weights
this
forgetfulness
of
her
mother
somehow
increased
her
extraordinary
satisfaction
with
life
she
remounted
the
shadowy
stairs
on
the
wings
of
a
pure
and
ingenuous
elation
chapter
x
miss
gailey
in
declension
i
knowing
whom
she
was
to
meet
hilda
came
home
to
tea
on
the
next
day
but
one
with
a
demeanour
whose
characteristics
were
heightened
by
nervousness
the
weather
was
still
colder
and
she
had
tied
the
broad
ribbons
of
her
small
bonnet
rather
closely
under
her
chin
the
double
bow
a
little
to
the
left
a
knitted
bodice
over
the
dress
and
under
the
jacket
made
the
latter
tighter
than
usual
so
that
the
fur
edges
of
it
curved
away
somewhat
between
the
buttons
and
all
the
upper
part
of
the
figure
seemed
to
be
too
strictly
confined
while
the
petticoats
surged
out
freely
beneath
a
muff
brightly
coloured
to
match
the
skirt
and
the
bonnet
and
her
cheeks
completed
the
costume
she
went
into
the
house
through
the
garden
and
delicately
stamped
her
feet
on
the
lobby
tiles
partly
to
warm
them
and
shake
off
a
few
bits
of
snow
and
partly
to
announce
clearly
her
arrival
then
just
as
she
was
hands
in
muff
she
entered
the
parlour
she
was
tingling
with
keen
rosy
life
and
with
the
sense
of
youthful
power
she
had
the
deep
unconscious
conviction
of
the
superiority
of
youth
to
age
and
there
were
the
two
older
women
waiting
for
her
as
it
were
on
the
defensive
and
as
nervous
as
she
good
afternoon
miss
gailey
she
said
with
a
kind
and
even
very
cordial
smile
and
heartily
shook
the
flaccid
rheumatic
hand
that
was
primly
held
out
to
her
and
yet
in
spite
of
herself
perhaps
unknown
to
herself
there
was
in
her
tone
and
her
smile
and
her
vigorous
clasp
something
which
meant
poor
old
thing
pityingly
indulgently
scornfully
she
had
not
spoken
to
miss
gailey
and
she
had
scarcely
seen
her
since
the
days
of
the
a
woman
who
is
in
process
of
losing
everything
but
her
pride
can
disappear
from
view
as
easily
in
a
small
town
as
in
a
great
city
her
acquaintances
will
say
to
each
other
i
have
met
lately
i
wonder
and
curiosity
will
go
no
further
and
in
a
short
time
her
invisibility
will
cease
to
excite
any
remark
except
she
keeps
herself
to
herself
nowadays
to
hilda
miss
gailey
appeared
no
older
her
brown
hair
had
very
little
grey
in
it
and
her
skin
was
fairly
smooth
and
but
she
seemed
curiously
smaller
and
less
significant
this
woman
who
with
a
certain
pedagogic
air
used
to
instruct
girls
in
grace
and
boys
in
gallantry
this
woman
who
was
regarded
by
all
her
pupils
as
the
authoritative
source
of
correctness
and
ease
in
deportment
now
master
charles
hilda
could
remember
her
saying
will
you
ask
me
for
the
next
polka
all
over
again
and
try
not
to
look
as
if
you
were
doing
me
a
favour
and
were
rather
ashamed
of
yourself
she
had
a
tongue
for
the
sneaping
of
too
casual
boys
and
girls
also
and
she
spoke
so
correctly
as
correctly
as
she
performed
the
figures
of
a
dance
hilda
who
also
spoke
without
the
local
peculiarities
had
been
deprived
of
her
five
towns
accent
at
chetwynd
school
where
the
purest
kensingtonian
was
inculcated
but
miss
gailey
had
lost
hers
in
kensington
itself
so
rumour
said
many
years
before
and
now
in
her
declension
she
was
still
perfect
of
speech
but
the
authority
and
the
importance
were
gone
in
substance
only
the
shadow
of
them
remained
she
had
now
indeed
a
manner
half
apologetic
and
half
defiant
but
timorously
and
weakly
defiant
her
head
was
restless
with
little
nervous
movements
her
watery
eyes
seemed
to
say
do
not
suppose
that
i
am
not
as
proud
and
independent
as
ever
i
was
because
i
look
at
my
silk
dress
and
my
polished
boots
and
my
smooth
hair
and
my
hands
can
anyone
find
any
trace
of
shabbiness
in
but
beneath
all
this
desperate
bravery
was
the
wistful
acknowledgment
out
that
she
had
after
all
come
down
in
the
world
albeit
with
a
special
personal
dignity
that
none
save
she
could
have
kept
ii
the
two
women
were
seated
at
a
splendid
fire
hilda
whose
nervousness
was
quickly
vanishing
came
between
them
to
warm
her
hands
that
were
shining
with
cold
despite
muff
and
gloves
here
mother
she
said
teasingly
putting
the
muff
and
gloves
in
her
mother
lap
sarah
gailey
rose
with
slow
stiffness
from
her
chair
now
do
let
this
child
disturb
you
sarah
lessways
protested
oh
no
caroline
said
miss
gailey
composedly
i
was
only
getting
my
apron
from
a
reticule
on
the
table
she
drew
forth
a
small
black
satin
apron
on
which
was
embroidered
in
filoselle
a
spray
of
it
was
extremely
elegant
much
more
so
than
lessways
though
not
in
quite
the
latest
style
of
fashionable
aprons
not
being
edible
it
had
probably
been
long
preserved
in
a
wardrobe
on
the
chance
of
just
such
an
occasion
as
this
she
adjusted
the
elastic
round
her
thin
waist
and
sat
down
again
the
apron
was
a
sign
that
she
had
come
definitely
to
spend
the
whole
evening
it
was
a
proof
of
the
completeness
of
the
reconciliation
between
the
former
friends
as
the
conversation
shifted
from
the
immediate
topic
of
the
weather
to
the
great
general
question
of
cures
for
chilblains
hilda
wondered
what
had
passed
between
her
mother
and
miss
gailey
and
whether
her
mother
had
overcome
by
mere
breezy
force
or
by
guile
which
details
she
never
learnt
for
lessways
was
very
loyal
to
her
former
crony
and
moreover
she
had
necessarily
to
support
the
honour
of
the
older
generation
against
the
younger
it
seemed
incredible
to
hilda
that
this
woman
who
sat
with
such
dignity
and
such
gentility
by
her
mother
fire
was
she
who
the
day
before
yesterday
had
been
starving
in
the
prison
of
her
own
house
could
miss
gailey
have
known
that
hilda
knew
but
hilda
knew
that
miss
gailey
knew
that
she
knew
and
that
others
guessed
such
however
was
the
sublime
force
of
convention
that
the
universal
pretence
of
ignorance
securely
triumphed
then
florrie
changed
grown
budded
practised
in
the
technicalities
of
parlours
but
timid
because
of
company
came
in
to
set
the
tea
and
miss
gailey
inspected
her
with
the
calm
and
omniscient
detachment
of
a
deity
and
said
to
caroline
when
she
was
gone
that
florrie
seemed
a
promising
little
thing
with
the
of
a
good
servant
in
her
afterwards
the
mistress
recounted
this
judgment
to
florrie
who
was
thereby
apparently
much
impressed
and
encouraged
in
iii
and
so
you
thinking
of
going
to
london
miss
gailey
said
hilda
during
tea
the
meal
was
progressing
satisfactorily
though
caroline
could
not
persuade
sarah
to
eat
enough
miss
gailey
flushed
slightly
with
the
characteristic
nervous
movement
of
the
head
evidently
her
sensitiveness
was
extreme
and
what
do
you
know
about
it
you
inquisitive
little
puss
lessways
intervened
hastily
though
it
was
she
who
had
informed
hilda
of
the
vague
project
somehow
in
presence
of
her
old
friend
lessways
seemed
to
feel
herself
under
an
obligation
to
play
the
assertive
and
crushing
mother
has
cannon
mentioned
it
said
miss
gailey
politely
miss
gailey
at
any
rate
recognized
in
the
most
scrupulous
way
that
hilda
was
an
adult
and
no
longer
a
pupil
for
dancing
well
he
seems
so
set
on
it
he
came
round
to
see
me
about
it
yesterday
morning
without
any
warning
and
he
was
full
of
it
i
told
you
how
full
he
was
of
it
did
i
caroline
you
know
how
he
is
when
anything
takes
him
do
i
know
how
he
is
murmured
caroline
arching
her
eyebrows
she
spoke
much
more
broadly
than
either
of
the
others
miss
gailey
continued
to
hilda
with
seriousness
it
a
that
he
got
control
of
up
there
something
about
a
bill
of
sale
on
the
furniture
i
think
but
perhaps
you
know
no
i
do
said
hilda
oh
said
miss
gailey
relieved
well
anyhow
he
bent
on
me
taking
charge
of
this
he
will
have
it
it
just
the
thing
for
me
but
but
i
do
know
she
finished
weakly
everyone
knows
you
a
splendid
housekeeper
said
lessways
always
were
i
remember
the
refreshments
at
your
annual
dances
said
hilda
politely
enthusiastic
i
always
attended
to
those
myself
miss
gailey
judicially
observed
i
do
know
anything
about
refreshments
at
dances
said
lessways
but
i
do
know
what
your
housekeeping
is
sarah
well
that
what
george
says
sarah
simpered
he
says
he
never
had
such
meals
and
such
attention
as
that
year
he
lived
with
me
i
sure
he
been
sorry
many
a
time
he
ever
left
you
exclaimed
caroline
many
and
many
a
time
oh
well
relatives
you
know
sarah
murmured
vaguely
this
was
the
only
reference
to
the
estrangement
she
went
on
with
more
vivacity
and
then
cannon
has
always
had
ideas
about
and
furnished
rooms
and
so
on
he
always
did
say
there
was
lots
of
money
to
be
made
out
of
them
if
only
they
were
managed
properly
only
they
never
are
he
ought
to
know
he
been
a
bachelor
long
enough
and
tried
enough
of
them
he
says
he
is
at
all
comfortable
where
he
is
she
added
as
it
were
aside
to
caroline
it
some
people
who
used
to
let
lodgings
to
theatre
people
at
hanbridge
oh
cried
caroline
the
talk
meandered
into
a
maze
of
reminiscences
and
hilda
had
to
realize
her
youthfulness
and
the
very
inferior
range
of
her
experience
sarah
and
caroline
recalled
to
each
other
dozens
of
persons
and
events
opening
up
historical
vistas
in
a
manner
that
filled
the
young
girl
with
envious
respect
in
spite
of
herself
do
you
remember
hanbridge
theatre
being
built
sarah
questioned
caroline
my
grandfather
hilda
tendered
for
it
not
that
he
got
the
job
but
he
was
very
old
did
he
now
no
i
do
but
i
dare
say
i
was
in
london
then
i
dare
say
that
would
be
it
yes
said
sarah
turning
to
hilda
once
more
that
just
what
cannon
says
he
says
it
is
as
if
i
did
know
what
london
is
but
it
such
a
long
time
ago
she
glanced
at
caroline
as
if
for
sympathy
come
come
sarah
caroline
protested
stoutly
and
yet
with
a
care
for
sarah
sensitiveness
it
is
so
long
ago
as
all
that
it
seems
so
long
said
sarah
reflective
and
her
mouth
worked
uneasily
then
after
a
pause
he
so
set
on
it
set
on
what
on
your
going
to
london
yes
and
why
not
well
i
do
know
whether
i
could
paw
scoffed
caroline
lightly
and
flatteringly
you
younger
than
i
am
and
i
not
going
to
have
anyone
making
out
that
i
getting
old
now
do
finish
that
bit
of
cake
no
thank
you
caroline
i
really
could
not
but
what
i
should
be
sorry
enough
to
lose
you
caroline
concluded
there
no
friends
like
the
old
friends
ah
no
sarah
thickly
muttered
gazing
with
her
watery
eyes
at
a
spot
on
the
white
diaper
hilda
do
turn
down
that
there
gas
a
bit
said
lessways
sharply
and
it
fizzing
and
she
changed
the
subject
iv
with
a
nervous
exaggeration
of
solicitude
hilda
sprang
to
the
suddenly
she
was
drenched
in
the
most
desolating
sadness
she
could
not
bear
to
look
at
miss
gailey
and
further
miss
gailey
seemed
unreal
to
her
not
an
actual
woman
but
an
abstract
figure
of
sorrow
that
fancy
had
created
a
few
minutes
previously
hilda
had
been
taking
pride
in
the
tact
and
the
enterprise
of
george
cannon
who
possessed
a
mysterious
gift
of
finding
an
opportunity
for
everybody
who
needed
it
he
had
set
hilda
on
her
feet
and
he
was
doing
the
same
for
his
and
with
such
skilful
diplomacy
that
miss
gailey
was
able
to
pretend
to
herself
and
to
others
that
george
cannon
and
not
sarah
gailey
was
the
obliged
person
but
now
hilda
saw
sarah
gailey
afraid
to
go
to
london
and
george
cannon
pushing
her
forward
with
all
the
ruthless
strength
of
his
enterprising
spirit
and
the
sight
was
extraordinarily
incomprehensibly
tragic
sarah
gailey
timorous
glance
seemed
to
be
saying
i
am
terrified
to
go
it
is
beyond
my
strength
it
beyond
my
spirit
but
i
shall
have
to
go
and
i
shall
have
to
seem
glad
to
go
and
nobody
can
save
me
and
miss
gailey
excellent
silk
dress
and
her
fine
apron
and
her
primness
and
dignified
manners
and
her
superb
pretence
of
being
undamaged
struck
hilda
as
intolerably
pathetic
so
that
she
was
obliged
to
look
away
lest
she
might
weep
at
the
sight
of
that
pathos
yes
it
was
a
fact
that
she
could
not
bear
to
look
nor
could
she
bear
to
let
her
imagination
roam
into
miss
gailey
immediate
past
she
said
to
herself
only
yesterday
morning
perhaps
she
did
know
where
her
next
meal
was
coming
from
he
must
have
managed
somehow
to
give
her
some
money
only
yesterday
morning
perhaps
she
did
know
where
her
next
meal
if
i
say
that
to
myself
once
more
i
shall
burst
out
crying
she
balanced
her
spoon
on
her
teacup
and
let
it
fall
now
miss
fidgety
her
mother
commented
with
good
humour
and
then
they
all
heard
a
knock
at
the
front
door
will
florrie
have
heard
it
lessways
asked
nervously
what
she
meant
was
who
on
earth
can
this
be
but
such
questions
can
not
be
put
in
the
presence
of
a
newly
reconciled
old
friend
it
was
necessary
to
behave
as
though
knocks
at
the
front
door
were
a
regular
accompaniment
of
tea
chapter
xi
disillusion
i
the
entrance
of
george
cannon
into
the
parlour
produced
a
tumult
greatly
stimulating
the
vitality
and
the
of
all
three
women
sarah
gailey
excitement
was
expressed
in
flushing
and
in
characteristic
small
futile
movements
of
the
head
and
hands
and
in
monosyllables
that
conveyed
naught
except
a
vague
but
keen
apprehension
lessways
was
perturbed
and
somewhat
apprehensive
also
but
she
was
flattered
and
pleased
hilda
was
frankly
suspicious
during
the
first
moments
she
guessed
that
cannon
was
aware
of
his
sister
visit
and
that
he
had
come
to
further
his
own
purposes
he
confirmed
her
idea
by
greeting
his
sister
without
apparent
surprise
but
as
in
response
to
lessways
insistence
he
took
off
his
great
overcoat
with
those
large
powerful
gestures
which
impress
susceptible
women
and
give
pleasure
even
to
the
indifferent
he
said
casually
to
sarah
gailey
i
did
expect
to
meet
you
here
sally
i
come
to
have
a
private
word
with
lessways
about
putting
one
of
her
calder
street
tenants
on
to
the
pavement
sarah
laughed
nervously
and
said
that
she
would
retire
and
lessways
said
that
sarah
would
do
no
such
thing
and
that
she
was
very
welcome
to
hear
all
that
cannon
might
have
to
say
concerning
the
calder
street
property
in
a
minute
cannon
was
resplendently
sitting
down
to
the
table
with
them
and
rubbing
his
friendly
hands
and
admitting
that
he
should
not
refuse
a
cup
of
tea
if
pressed
and
hilda
received
her
mother
sharp
instructions
to
get
a
cup
and
saucer
from
the
sideboard
and
a
spoon
from
the
drawer
she
bore
these
to
the
table
like
a
handmaid
but
like
a
delicate
and
superior
handmaid
and
it
pleased
her
to
constitute
herself
a
delicate
and
superior
handmaid
cannon
sat
next
to
her
mother
and
hilda
put
down
the
tinkling
cup
and
saucer
on
the
white
cloth
between
them
and
as
she
did
so
cannon
turned
and
thanked
her
with
a
confidential
smile
to
which
she
responded
they
were
not
now
employer
and
employee
but
exclusively
in
the
social
world
nevertheless
their
business
relations
made
an
intimacy
which
it
was
piquant
to
feel
in
the
home
moreover
sarah
gailey
was
opposite
to
them
and
hilda
could
not
keep
out
of
her
dark
eyes
the
intelligence
if
she
is
here
if
you
are
all
amicable
together
it
is
due
to
me
delicious
and
somehow
perilous
secret
going
back
to
her
seat
she
arranged
more
safely
the
vast
overcoat
which
he
had
thrown
carelessly
down
on
her
mother
chair
it
was
inordinately
heavy
and
would
have
outweighed
a
dozen
of
her
skimpy
little
jackets
she
who
would
have
been
lost
in
it
like
a
cat
in
a
rug
enjoyed
the
thought
of
the
force
of
the
creature
capable
of
wearing
it
lightly
for
a
garment
withal
the
rough
soft
surface
of
it
was
agreeable
to
the
hand
out
of
one
of
the
immense
pockets
hung
the
end
of
a
coloured
silk
muffler
filmy
as
anything
that
she
herself
wore
then
they
were
all
definitely
seated
and
cannon
accepted
his
tea
from
the
hand
of
lessways
the
whiteness
of
his
linen
the
new
smartness
of
his
suit
the
elegance
and
gallantry
of
his
gestures
these
phenomena
incited
the
women
to
a
responsive
emulation
they
were
something
which
it
was
a
feminine
duty
to
live
up
to
archness
reigned
especially
between
the
hostess
and
the
caller
hilda
answered
to
the
mood
and
sarah
gailey
though
she
said
little
and
never
finished
a
sentence
did
her
best
to
answer
to
it
by
noddings
and
nervous
appreciative
smiles
and
swift
turnings
of
the
head
from
one
to
another
when
cannon
and
lessways
in
half
a
dozen
serious
words
interjected
among
the
archness
had
adversely
settled
the
fate
of
a
whole
family
in
calder
street
there
remained
scarcely
a
trace
in
the
company
demeanour
of
the
shamed
consciousness
that
only
two
days
before
its
members
had
been
divided
by
disastrous
enmities
and
that
one
of
them
had
lacked
the
means
of
life
ii
oh
no
my
dear
girl
you
too
modest
that
what
the
matter
with
you
said
george
cannon
eagerly
to
his
the
epithet
flattered
but
did
not
allay
her
timidity
to
hilda
it
seemed
mysteriously
romantic
the
supreme
topic
had
worked
its
way
into
the
conversation
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
all
it
seemed
to
have
forced
itself
out
by
its
own
intrinsic
energy
against
the
will
of
the
company
impossible
to
decide
who
first
had
let
it
forth
but
george
cannon
had
now
fairly
seized
it
and
run
off
with
it
he
was
almost
boyishly
excited
over
it
the
latin
strain
in
him
animated
his
features
and
his
speech
he
was
a
poet
as
he
talked
of
the
that
awaited
a
mistress
he
had
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
the
cutting
of
an
advertisement
of
it
from
the
london
a
paper
that
was
never
seen
in
turnhill
and
this
bit
of
paper
describing
in
four
lines
the
advantages
of
the
had
the
effect
of
giving
the
actual
house
a
symbolic
reality
there
it
is
he
exclaimed
slapping
down
the
paper
and
there
it
appeared
really
to
be
the
bit
of
paper
was
extraordinarily
persuasive
it
compelled
everybody
to
realize
now
for
the
first
time
that
the
house
did
in
fact
exist
george
cannon
had
an
overwhelming
answer
to
all
timorous
objections
the
was
remunerative
boarders
were
at
that
very
moment
in
it
the
nominal
proprietor
was
not
leaving
it
because
he
was
losing
money
on
the
but
because
he
had
lost
money
in
another
enterprise
quite
foreign
to
it
and
had
pledged
all
the
contents
of
the
as
security
the
occasion
was
one
in
a
thousand
one
in
a
million
he
george
cannon
through
a
client
had
the
entire
marvellous
affair
between
his
finger
and
thumb
and
most
obviously
sarah
gailey
was
the
woman
of
all
women
for
the
vacant
post
at
his
disposition
chance
was
waiting
on
her
she
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
but
walk
into
the
house
as
a
regent
into
a
kingdom
and
rule
only
delay
was
impossible
all
was
possible
except
delay
she
would
inevitably
succeed
she
could
not
fail
and
it
would
be
a
family
affair
tea
was
finished
and
forgotten
for
your
own
sake
he
wound
up
a
peroration
it
really
does
matter
to
me
do
you
agree
with
me
mrs
lessways
his
glance
was
a
homage
oh
you
exclaimed
lessways
smiling
happily
you
only
got
to
open
your
mouth
and
you
talk
anybody
into
the
middle
of
next
week
mother
hilda
mildly
reproved
she
was
convinced
now
that
cannon
had
come
on
purpose
to
clinch
the
affair
he
laughed
appreciatively
but
really
seriously
he
insisted
and
lessways
straightening
her
face
said
with
slight
oh
think
it
worth
while
considering
there
you
are
cried
cannon
to
miss
gailey
i
shall
be
all
alone
up
there
said
miss
gailey
as
cheerfully
as
she
could
i
go
up
with
you
and
see
you
into
the
place
i
should
have
to
come
back
the
same
night
i
so
tremendously
busy
just
now
what
with
the
paper
and
so
on
yes
but
i
quite
admit
all
you
say
george
but
here
another
idea
he
broke
out
why
do
you
ask
lessways
to
go
up
with
you
and
stay
a
week
or
two
it
would
be
a
rare
change
for
her
and
company
for
you
miss
gailey
looked
quickly
at
her
old
friend
oh
bless
you
said
lessways
i
only
been
to
london
once
and
that
was
only
for
two
days
before
hilda
was
born
i
should
be
no
use
in
london
at
my
time
of
life
i
one
of
your
nevertheless
it
was
plain
that
the
notion
appealed
to
her
fancy
and
that
she
would
enjoy
flirting
with
it
nonsense
mrs
lessways
said
george
cannon
it
would
do
you
a
world
of
good
and
it
would
make
all
the
difference
to
sally
that
it
would
sarah
agreed
still
questioning
caroline
with
her
watery
appealing
eyes
in
caroline
sarah
saw
her
salvation
and
snatched
at
it
caroline
could
do
nothing
well
she
had
no
excellence
all
that
caroline
could
do
sarah
could
do
better
and
yet
caroline
by
the
mysterious
virtue
of
her
dry
and
yet
genial
shrewdness
and
of
the
unstable
but
reliable
equilibrium
of
her
temperament
was
the
skilled
sarah
superior
they
both
knew
it
and
felt
it
the
lofty
hilda
admitted
it
caroline
herself
negligently
admitted
it
by
a
peculiar
brusque
unaffected
geniality
of
condescension
towards
sarah
do
go
mother
said
hilda
to
herself
she
had
been
saying
another
of
his
wonderful
ideas
the
prospect
of
being
alone
in
the
house
with
florrie
of
being
free
for
a
space
to
live
her
own
life
untrammelled
and
throw
all
her
ardour
into
her
work
was
inexpressibly
attractive
to
hilda
it
promised
the
most
delicious
experience
that
she
had
ever
had
yes
retorted
lessways
and
leave
you
here
by
yourself
a
nice
thing
i
shall
be
all
right
said
hilda
confidently
and
joyously
she
was
sure
that
the
excursion
to
london
had
appealed
to
her
mother
latent
love
of
the
unexpected
and
that
her
faculty
for
accepting
placidly
whatever
fate
offered
would
prevent
her
from
resisting
the
pressure
that
sarah
gailey
and
cannon
would
obviously
exert
shall
you
lessways
muttered
why
not
take
your
daughter
with
you
too
cannon
suggested
oh
cried
hilda
shocked
i
could
possibly
leave
my
work
just
now
the
paper
just
coming
out
you
could
spare
me
she
spoke
with
pride
using
phrases
similar
to
those
which
he
had
used
to
explain
to
sarah
gailey
why
he
could
not
remain
with
her
in
london
even
for
a
night
oh
yes
i
could
he
answered
kindly
lightly
carelessly
shattering
in
his
preoccupation
with
one
idea
all
her
fine
loyal
pretensions
we
should
manage
all
right
iii
she
was
hurt
she
was
mortally
pierced
the
blow
was
too
cruel
she
lowered
her
glance
before
his
and
fixed
it
on
the
her
brow
darkened
her
lower
lip
bulged
out
she
was
the
child
again
he
had
with
atrocious
inhumanity
reduced
her
to
the
unimportance
of
a
child
she
had
bestowed
on
him
and
his
interests
the
gift
of
her
whole
soul
and
he
had
said
that
it
was
negligible
and
the
worst
was
that
he
was
perfectly
unaware
of
what
he
had
done
he
had
not
even
observed
the
symptoms
of
her
face
he
had
turned
at
once
to
the
older
women
and
was
continuing
the
conversation
he
had
ridden
over
her
and
ridden
on
without
a
look
behind
the
conversation
moved
after
a
pause
back
to
the
plausible
excuse
for
his
call
he
desired
to
see
some
old
which
would
show
how
the
doomed
tenant
in
calder
street
had
originally
fallen
into
arrears
where
is
that
old
book
of
skellorn
hilda
her
mother
asked
she
could
not
speak
the
sob
was
at
her
throat
if
she
had
spoken
it
would
have
burst
through
and
she
would
have
been
not
merely
the
child
but
the
disgraced
child
hilda
repeated
her
mother
her
singular
silence
drew
the
attention
of
all
she
blushed
a
sombre
scarlet
no
she
could
not
speak
she
cursed
herself
what
a
little
fool
i
am
surely
i
can
useless
she
could
not
speak
she
took
the
one
desperate
course
open
to
her
and
ran
out
of
the
room
to
the
astonishment
of
three
puzzled
and
rather
frightened
adults
her
shame
was
now
notorious
baby
great
baby
she
gnashed
at
her
own
inconceivable
silliness
had
she
no
pride
and
now
she
was
in
the
gloom
of
the
lobby
and
she
could
hear
florrie
in
the
kitchen
softly
whistling
she
was
out
in
the
dark
lobby
exactly
like
a
foolish
passionate
child
she
knew
all
the
time
that
she
could
easily
persuade
her
mother
to
leave
her
alone
with
florrie
in
the
house
she
had
levers
to
move
her
mother

a
day
resembling
spring
had
come
illusive
but
exquisite
hilda
having
started
out
too
hurriedly
for
the
office
after
the
midday
dinner
had
had
to
return
home
for
a
proof
which
she
had
forgotten
she
now
had
the
house
to
herself
as
a
kingdom
over
which
she
reigned
for
amid
all
her
humiliation
and
pensive
dejection
she
had
been
able
to
exert
sufficient
harsh
force
to
drive
her
mother
to
london
in
company
with
miss
gailey
she
was
alone
free
and
she
tasted
her
freedom
to
the
point
of
ecstasy
she
conned
corrected
proofs
at
her
meals
this
was
life
when
florrie
came
in
with
another
dish
hilda
looked
up
impatiently
from
printed
matter
as
if
disturbed
out
of
a
dream
and
florrie
put
on
an
apologetic
air
to
invoke
pardon
it
was
largely
pretence
on
hilda
part
but
it
was
life
then
she
had
the
delicious
anxiety
of
being
responsible
for
florrie
now
florrie
i
going
out
to
see
miss
orgreave
at
bleakridge
i
shall
rely
on
you
to
go
to
bed
not
later
than
nine
i
got
the
key
may
not
be
back
till
the
last
yes
miss
and
what
with
hilda
solemnity
and
florrie
impressed
eyes
the
was
transformed
into
a
train
that
circulated
in
the
dark
and
mysterious
hour
just
before
cockcrow
hilda
alone
was
always
appealing
to
florrie
loyalty
sometimes
when
discreetly
abolishing
some
method
of
her
mother
she
would
speak
to
florrie
in
a
tone
of
sudden
transient
intimacy
raising
her
for
a
moment
to
the
rank
of
an
intellectual
equal
as
her
voice
hinted
that
her
mother
after
all
belonged
to
the
effete
generation
awkwardly
with
her
gloved
hands
turning
over
the
pages
of
a
book
in
which
the
had
been
carelessly
left
hidden
hilda
from
her
bedroom
heard
florrie
come
whistling
down
the
attic
stairs
florrie
had
certainly
heard
nothing
of
her
young
mistress
since
the
which
had
signalled
her
departure
for
the
office
in
the
delusion
that
she
was
utterly
solitary
in
the
house
florrie
was
whistling
not
at
all
like
a
modest
young
woman
but
like
a
carter
hilda
knew
that
she
could
whistle
and
had
several
times
indicated
to
her
indirectly
that
whistling
was
undesirable
but
she
had
never
heard
her
whistling
as
she
whistled
now
her
first
impulse
was
to
rush
out
of
the
bedroom
and
florrie
and
make
her
look
foolish
but
a
sense
of
honour
restrained
her
from
a
triumph
so
mean
and
she
kept
perfectly
still
she
heard
florrie
run
into
her
mother
bedroom
and
then
she
heard
that
voice
usually
so
timid
saying
loudly
exultantly
and
even
coarsely
oh
how
beautiful
i
am
how
beautiful
i
am
sha
i
just
mash
the
men
sha
i
just
mash
this
new
and
vulgar
word
offended
hilda
ii
she
crept
noiselessly
to
the
door
which
was
ajar
and
looked
forth
like
a
thief
the
door
of
her
mother
room
was
wide
open
and
across
the
landing
she
could
see
florrie
posturing
in
front
of
the
large
mirror
of
the
wardrobe
the
sight
shocked
her
in
a
most
peculiar
manner
it
was
florrie
afternoon
out
and
the
child
was
wearing
for
the
first
time
an
old
brown
skirt
that
hilda
had
abandoned
to
her
but
in
this
long
skirt
she
was
no
more
a
child
although
scarcely
yet
fifteen
years
old
she
was
a
grown
woman
she
had
astoundingly
developed
during
her
service
with
lessways
she
was
scarcely
less
tall
than
hilda
and
she
possessed
a
sturdy
rounded
figure
which
put
hilda
to
shame
it
was
uncanny
the
precocity
of
the
children
of
the
poor
it
was
disturbing
on
a
chair
lay
florrie
new
cloak
and
a
cheap
but
sound
bonnet
both
articles
the
fruit
of
a
special
journey
with
her
aunt
to
baines
drapery
shop
at
bursley
where
there
was
a
small
special
sober
department
for
servants
who
were
wise
enough
not
to
yield
to
the
temptation
of
florrie
who
at
thirteen
and
a
half
had
never
been
able
to
rattle
one
penny
against
another
had
since
then
earned
some
two
thousand
five
hundred
pennies
and
had
clothed
herself
and
put
money
aside
and
also
poured
a
shower
of
silver
upon
her
clamorous
family
amazing
feat
amazing
growth
she
seized
the
warm
cloak
and
hid
her
poor
old
bodice
beneath
it
and
drew
out
her
thick
and
shook
it
into
position
with
a
free
gesture
of
the
head
and
on
the
head
she
poised
the
bonnet
and
tied
the
ribbons
under
the
delightful
chin
and
then
after
a
moment
of
hard
scrutiny
danced
and
whistled
and
cried
again
how
beautiful
i
am
how
pretty
i
am
she
was
she
positively
did
not
look
a
bit
like
a
drudge
she
was
not
the
florrie
of
the
kitchen
and
of
the
but
a
young
fledged
creature
with
bursting
bosom
who
could
trouble
any
man
by
the
capricious
modesty
of
a
gaze
downcast
the
miraculous
skirt
odious
on
hilda
had
the
brightness
of
a
new
skirt
her
hands
and
arms
were
red
and
chapped
but
her
face
had
bloomed
perfect
in
the
kitchen
like
a
flower
in
a
it
was
a
face
that
an
ambitious
girl
could
rely
on
its
charm
and
the
fluid
charm
of
her
movements
atoned
a
thousand
times
for
all
her
barbaric
ignorance
and
crudity
the
grime
on
her
neck
was
naught
hilda
watched
intensely
ashamed
of
this
spying
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
withdraw
she
was
angry
with
florrie
she
was
outraged
then
she
thought
why
should
i
be
angry
the
fact
is
i
being
mother
all
over
again
after
all
why
should
florrie
and
she
was
a
little
jealous
of
florrie
and
a
little
envious
of
her
because
florrie
had
the
naturalness
of
a
savage
or
of
an
animal
unsophisticated
by
ideals
of
primness
hilda
was
disconcerted
at
the
discovery
of
florrie
as
an
authentic
young
woman
florrie
more
than
seven
years
her
junior
she
felt
experienced
and
indulgent
as
the
old
are
indulgent
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
did
honestly
feel
old
and
she
asked
herself
half
in
dismay
florrie
has
got
thus
far
where
am
what
am
doing
it
was
upsetting
at
length
florrie
took
off
the
bonnet
and
ran
upstairs
and
shut
the
door
of
her
attic
apparently
she
meant
to
improve
the
bonnet
by
some
touch
after
waiting
nervously
a
few
moments
the
aged
hilda
slipped
silently
downstairs
and
through
the
kitchen
and
so
by
the
garden
where
with
their
feet
in
mire
the
hare
trees
were
giving
signs
of
hope
under
the
soft
blue
sky
into
the
street
florrie
would
never
know
that
she
had
been
watched
iii
ten
minutes
later
when
she
went
into
the
office
of
dayson
hilda
was
younger
than
ever
it
was
a
young
fragile
girl
despite
the
dark
frown
of
her
intense
seriousness
who
with
accustomed
gestures
poked
the
stove
and
hung
bonnet
and
jacket
on
a
nail
and
then
sat
down
to
the
loaded
desk
it
was
an
ingenuous
girl
absurdly
but
fiercely
anxious
to
shoulder
the
world
weight
she
had
passed
a
whole
night
in
revolt
against
george
cannon
indignity
she
had
called
it
furiously
an
insult
she
had
said
to
herself
well
if
i
so
useless
as
all
that
i
never
go
near
his
office
again
but
the
next
afternoon
she
had
appeared
as
usual
at
the
office
meek
modest
with
a
smile
fatigued
and
exquisitely
resigned
and
a
soft
voice
and
she
had
worked
with
even
increased
energy
and
devotion
this
kissing
of
the
rod
this
irrational
instinctive
humility
was
a
strange
and
sweet
experience
for
her
such
was
the
hilda
of
the
office
but
hilda
at
home
cantankerous
obstinate
and
rude
had
offered
a
remarkable
contrast
to
her
until
the
moment
when
it
was
decided
that
her
mother
should
accompany
miss
gailey
to
london
from
that
moment
hilda
at
home
had
been
an
angel
and
the
hilda
of
the
office
had
shown
some
return
of
sturdy
pride
the
first
number
of
five
towns
was
to
go
to
press
the
delays
had
been
inexplicable
and
exasperating
to
hilda
though
she
had
not
criticized
them
even
to
herself
they
were
now
over
the
town
had
no
air
of
being
excited
about
the
appearance
of
its
new
paper
but
the
office
was
excited
the
very
room
itself
looked
feverish
it
was
changed
more
tables
had
been
brought
into
it
and
papers
and
litter
had
accumulated
enormously
it
was
a
room
humanized
by
habitation
with
a
physiognomy
that
was
individual
and
sympathetic
from
beyond
the
closed
door
of
the
inner
room
came
the
sound
of
rapid
voices
hilda
could
distinguish
cannon
and
arthur
dayson
there
was
a
third
unfamiliar
to
her
having
nothing
to
do
she
began
to
make
work
rearranging
the
contents
of
her
table
fingering
with
a
factitious
hurry
the
thick
bundles
of
proofs
of
correspondence
from
the
villages
so
energetically
organized
by
the
great
dayson
and
the
now
useless
and
the
innumerable
letters
that
dayson
was
always
disturbing
and
the
samples
of
encaustic
tiles
brought
in
by
an
inventor
who
desired
the
powerful
aid
of
the
press
and
the
catalogues
and
dayson
cuttings
from
the
manchester
birmingham
and
london
papers
and
the
notepaper
and
envelopes
and
cards
and
veale
chifferiel
almanac
that
had
somehow
come
up
with
other
matters
from
office
below
and
then
she
dusted
with
pursed
lips
that
blamed
the
disgraceful
and
yet
excusable
untidiness
of
men
and
then
she
examined
with
despair
and
with
pride
her
dirty
little
hands
whose
all
clustered
together
they
were
now
like
the
hands
of
a
nice
careless
schoolboy
and
lightly
dusted
one
against
the
other
then
she
found
a
under
the
table
it
was
a
duplicate
proof
of
five
towns
leading
article
dictated
to
her
by
a
prodigious
arthur
dayson
in
cannon
presence
on
the
previous
day
and
dealing
faithfully
with
the
calder
street
scandal
and
with
enville
a
member
of
the
local
board
implicated
in
the
said
scandal
the
proof
was
useless
now
for
the
was
made
up
nevertheless
hilda
carefully
classified
it
in
case
iv
on
a
chair
was
daily
which
dayson
had
evidently
been
reading
for
it
was
blue
pencilled
hilda
too
must
read
it
her
duty
was
to
read
it
dayson
had
told
her
that
she
ought
never
to
neglect
the
chance
of
reading
any
newspaper
whatever
and
that
a
young
woman
in
her
responsible
situation
could
not
possibly
know
too
much
which
advice
though
it
came
from
a
person
ridiculous
to
her
seemed
sound
enough
and
was
in
fact
rather
flattering
in
the
she
saw
between
dayson
blue
lines
an
account
of
a
terrible
military
disaster
she
was
moved
by
it
in
different
ways
it
produced
in
her
a
grievous
struck
desolation
but
it
also
gave
her
an
extraordinary
sensation
of
fervid
pleasure
it
was
an
item
of
news
that
would
have
to
appear
in
the
and
this
would
mean
changes
in
the
and
work
at
express
speed
and
similar
delights
already
the
paper
was
supposed
to
be
on
the
machine
though
in
fact
as
she
well
knew
it
was
not
no
doubt
the
subject
of
discussion
in
the
inner
room
was
the
disaster
yes
she
was
acutely
and
happily
excited
and
always
afterwards
when
she
heard
or
saw
the
sinister
word
whose
political
associations
never
in
the
least
interested
her
she
would
recall
her
contradictory
delicious
feelings
on
that
dramatic
afternoon
while
she
was
busily
cutting
out
the
news
from
the
to
be
ready
for
arthur
dayson
there
was
a
very
timid
knock
at
the
door
and
florrie
entered
as
into
some
formidable
cabinet
of
tyrannic
rulers
if
you
please
miss
she
began
to
whisper
why
florrie
hilda
exclaimed
what
have
you
put
that
old
skirt
on
for
when
i
given
you
mine
i
told
you
i
did
put
it
on
miss
but
there
came
a
telegram
i
told
the
boy
you
were
here
but
he
said
that
was
no
affair
of
his
so
i
brought
it
myself
and
i
thought
you
would
care
for
to
see
me
in
your
skirt
miss
not
while
on
duty
miss
here
like
so
i
up
quick
and
changed
it
back
telegram
hilda
repeated
the
word
florrie
breathless
after
running
and
all
this
whispering
advanced
in
the
prettiest
confusion
towards
the
throne
and
hilda
took
the
telegram
with
a
gesture
as
casual
as
she
could
manage
florrie
abashed
mien
and
the
arrival
of
the
telegram
stiffened
her
back
and
steadied
her
hand
imagine
that
infant
being
afraid
of
her
hilda
this
too
was
life
and
the
murmur
of
the
men
in
the
inner
room
was
thrilling
to
ears
she
brusquely
opened
the
telegram
and
read
lessways
lessways
street
turnhill
mother
can
you
come
gailey
chapter
xiii
hilda
world
i
the
conversation
in
the
inner
room
promised
to
be
interminable
hilda
could
not
decide
what
to
do
she
felt
no
real
alarm
on
her
account
lessways
often
slightly
indisposed
was
never
seriously
ill
she
possessed
one
of
those
constitutions
which
do
not
go
to
extremes
of
disease
if
a
malady
overtook
her
she
invariably
it
in
a
mild
form
doubtless
sarah
gailey
preoccupied
and
worried
by
new
responsibilities
desired
to
avoid
the
added
care
of
nursing
the
sick
hence
the
telegram
moreover
if
the
case
had
been
grave
she
would
not
have
put
the
telegram
in
the
interrogative
she
would
have
written
come
at
once
no
hilda
was
not
unduly
disturbed
nevertheless
she
had
an
odd
idea
that
she
ought
to
rush
to
the
station
and
catch
the
next
train
which
left
knype
at
five
minutes
to
four
this
idea
did
not
spring
from
her
own
conscience
but
rather
from
the
collective
family
conscience
but
at
a
quarter
to
four
when
it
was
already
too
late
to
catch
the
local
train
at
turnhill
the
men
had
not
emerged
from
the
inner
room
nor
had
hilda
come
to
any
decision
as
the
departure
of
her
mother
and
miss
gailey
had
involved
much
solemn
poring
over
it
happened
that
she
knew
the
times
of
all
the
trains
to
london
to
catch
the
next
and
last
she
would
have
to
leave
turnhill
at
she
said
that
she
would
wait
and
see
her
work
for
the
first
number
of
the
paper
was
practically
done
but
there
was
this
mysterious
conclave
which
fretted
her
curiosity
and
threatened
exciting
development
also
the
majuba
disaster
would
mean
trouble
for
somebody
and
in
any
event
she
hated
the
very
thought
of
quitting
turnhill
before
the
was
definitely
out
she
had
lived
for
the
moment
of
its
publication
and
she
could
not
bear
to
miss
it
she
was
almost
angry
with
her
mother
she
was
certainly
angry
with
miss
gailey
all
the
egotism
of
the
devotee
in
her
was
aroused
and
irate
then
the
men
came
forth
from
the
inner
room
with
a
rather
unexpected
suddenness
cannon
appeared
first
and
after
him
enville
lastly
arthur
dayson
papers
in
hand
intimidated
by
the
presence
of
the
stranger
hilda
affected
to
be
busy
at
her
table
enville
shook
hands
very
amicably
with
george
cannon
and
instantly
departed
as
he
passed
down
the
stairs
she
caught
sight
of
him
he
was
a
grizzled
man
of
fifty
lean
and
shabby
despite
his
reputation
for
riches
she
knew
that
he
was
a
candidate
for
the
supreme
position
of
chief
bailiff
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
he
did
not
accord
with
her
spectacular
ideal
of
a
chief
bailiff
the
actual
chief
bailiff
was
a
beautiful
and
picturesque
old
man
with
perfectly
tended
white
whiskers
and
always
a
flower
in
his
coat
further
she
could
not
reconcile
this
nearly
effusive
friendliness
between
enville
and
cannon
with
the
animadversions
of
the
leading
article
which
arthur
dayson
had
composed
and
cannon
had
approved
only
hours
earlier
as
cannon
shut
the
door
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
she
saw
him
give
a
discreet
disdainful
wink
to
dayson
then
he
turned
sharply
to
hilda
and
said
thoughtful
and
stern
your
notebook
please
bracing
herself
and
still
full
of
pride
in
her
ability
to
write
this
mysterious
shorthand
she
opened
her
notebook
and
waited
with
poised
pencil
the
mien
of
the
two
men
had
communicated
to
her
an
excitement
far
surpassing
their
own
in
degree
and
in
felicity
the
whole
of
her
vital
force
was
concentrated
at
the
point
of
her
pencil
and
she
seemed
to
be
saying
to
herself
i
very
sorry
mother
but
see
how
important
this
is
i
shall
consider
what
i
can
do
for
you
the
very
moment
i
am
free
arthur
dayson
coughed
and
plumped
heavily
on
a
chair
ii
it
was
in
such
moments
as
this
that
dayson
really
lived
with
all
the
force
of
his
mediocrity
george
cannon
was
not
a
journalist
he
could
compose
a
letter
but
he
had
not
the
trick
of
composing
an
article
he
felt
indeed
a
negligent
disdain
for
the
people
who
possessed
this
trick
as
for
performers
in
a
circus
he
certainly
did
not
envy
them
for
he
knew
that
he
could
buy
them
as
a
carpenter
buys
tools
his
attitude
was
that
of
the
genuine
bourgeois
towards
the
artist
possessive
incurious
and
contemptuous
dayson
however
ignored
george
cannon
attitude
perhaps
did
not
even
perceive
what
it
was
he
gloried
in
his
performance
accustomed
to
dictate
extempore
speeches
on
any
subject
whatever
to
his
shorthand
pupils
he
was
quite
at
his
ease
quite
master
of
his
faculties
and
seemed
to
stand
out
on
his
brow
like
genial
sweat
while
the
banal
phrases
poured
glibly
from
the
cavern
behind
his
jagged
teeth
and
each
phrase
was
a
perfect
model
of
provincial
journalese
george
cannon
had
to
sit
and
listen
to
approve
or
at
worst
to
make
tentative
suggestions
the
first
phrase
which
penetrated
through
the
outer
brain
of
the
shorthand
writer
to
the
secret
fastness
where
hilda
sat
in
judgment
on
the
world
was
this
the
campaign
of
vulgar
vilification
inaugurated
yesterday
by
our
contemporary
staffordshire
against
our
esteemed
richard
enville
this
phrase
came
soon
after
such
phrases
as
our
first
bow
to
the
public
our
solemn
and
bounden
duty
to
the
district
which
it
is
our
highest
ambition
to
serve
etc
phrases
which
had
already
occurred
in
the
leading
article
dictated
on
the
previous
day
hilda
soon
comprehended
that
in
hours
enville
from
being
an
unscrupulous
speculator
who
had
used
his
official
position
to
make
illicit
profits
out
of
the
sale
of
land
to
the
town
for
town
improvements
had
become
the
very
mirror
of
honesty
and
high
fidelity
to
the
noblest
traditions
of
local
government
without
understanding
the
situation
and
before
even
she
had
formulated
to
herself
any
criticism
of
the
persons
concerned
she
felt
suddenly
sick
she
dared
not
look
at
george
cannon
but
once
when
she
raised
her
head
to
await
the
flow
of
a
period
that
had
been
arrested
at
a
laudatory
superlative
she
caught
dayson
winking
coarsely
at
him
she
hated
dayson
for
that
george
cannon
might
wink
at
dayson
though
she
regretted
the
condescending
familiarity
but
dayson
had
no
right
to
presume
to
wink
at
george
cannon
she
hoped
that
cannon
had
silently
snubbed
him
as
the
article
proceeded
there
arose
a
crying
from
the
square
below
a
boy
one
of
the
earliest
to
break
the
silent
habit
of
the
square
was
bawling
a
fresh
edition
of
arthur
dayson
contemporary
and
across
the
web
of
the
dictator
verbiage
she
could
hear
the
words
south
africa
details
cannon
glanced
at
his
watch
impatiently
hilda
could
see
under
her
bent
and
frowning
brow
his
white
hand
moving
on
the
dark
expanse
of
his
waistcoat
immediately
afterwards
cannon
interrupting
said
that
be
all
right
finish
it
i
must
be
off
right
you
are
said
dayson
grandly
i
run
down
with
it
to
the
printer
myself
soon
as
it
copied
cannon
nodded
and
tell
him
we
got
to
be
on
the
railway
bookstalls
first
thing
morning
he
never
do
it
he
must
do
it
i
do
care
if
he
works
all
night
but
there
has
got
to
be
any
dayson
there
been
a
damned
sight
too
much
delay
as
it
is
all
right
all
right
dayson
placated
him
hastily
cannon
departed
it
seemed
to
hilda
that
she
shivered
but
whether
with
pain
or
pleasure
she
knew
not
never
before
had
cannon
sworn
in
her
presence
all
day
his
manner
had
been
peculiar
as
though
the
strain
of
mysterious
anxieties
was
changing
his
spirit
and
now
he
was
gone
and
she
had
said
naught
to
him
about
the
telegram
from
miss
gailey
arthur
dayson
rolled
oratorically
on
in
defence
of
the
man
whom
yesterday
he
had
attacked
and
then
sowter
the
old
clerk
entered
what
is
it
do
interrupt
me
snapped
dayson
there
the
latest
details
this
here
majuba
business
what
do
i
care
about
your
majuba
dayson
retorted
i
got
something
more
important
than
your
majuba
it
was
the
governor
as
told
me
to
give
it
you
said
sowter
restive
well
give
it
me
then
and
do
waste
my
time
dayson
held
out
an
imperial
hand
for
the
sheet
he
looked
at
hilda
as
if
for
moral
support
and
added
to
her
in
a
martyred
tone
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
dash
off
a
few
lines
about
sowter
majuba
while
you
copying
out
my
article
and
the
governor
said
to
remind
you
that
enville
wants
a
proof
of
his
advertisement
sowter
called
out
sulkily
as
he
was
disappearing
down
the
stairs
hilda
blushed
as
she
had
blushed
in
writing
george
cannon
first
lie
about
the
printing
of
the
first
issue
she
had
accustomed
herself
to
lies
and
really
without
any
difficulty
or
hesitation
yes
she
had
even
reached
the
level
of
being
religiously
proud
of
them
but
now
her
bullied
and
crushed
conscience
leaped
up
again
and
in
the
swift
alarm
of
the
shock
her
heart
was
once
more
violently
beating
yet
amid
the
wild
confusion
of
her
feelings
a
mechanical
intelligence
guided
her
hand
to
follow
arthur
dayson
final
sentences
and
there
shone
out
from
her
soul
a
contempt
for
the
miserable
hack
so
dazzling
that
it
would
have
blinded
him
had
he
not
been
already
blind
iii
that
evening
she
sat
alone
in
the
office
the
first
number
of
five
towns
after
the
most
astounding
adventures
had
miraculously
gone
to
press
dayson
and
sowter
had
departed
there
was
no
reason
why
hilda
should
remain
burning
gas
to
no
purpose
she
had
telegraphed
by
favour
of
a
karkeek
to
miss
gailey
saying
that
she
would
come
by
the
first
train
on
the
morrow
saturday
and
she
had
therefore
much
to
do
at
home
nevertheless
she
sat
idle
in
the
office
unable
to
leave
her
whole
life
was
in
that
office
and
it
was
just
when
she
was
most
weary
of
the
environment
that
she
would
vacillate
longest
before
quitting
it
she
was
unhappy
and
apprehensive
much
less
about
her
mother
than
about
the
attitude
of
her
conscience
towards
the
morals
of
this
new
world
of
hers
the
dramatic
enville
incident
had
spoiled
the
pleasure
which
she
had
felt
in
sacrificing
her
formal
duty
as
a
daughter
to
her
duty
as
a
clerk
she
had
been
disillusioned
she
foresaw
the
future
with
alarm
and
yet
strangely
the
disillusion
and
the
fear
were
a
source
of
pleasure
she
savoured
them
with
her
loyalty
that
loyalty
which
had
survived
even
the
frightful
blow
of
george
cannon
casual
disdain
at
her
mother
whatever
this
new
world
might
be
it
was
hers
it
was
precious
she
would
no
more
think
of
abandoning
it
than
a
young
mother
would
think
of
abandoning
a
baby
obviously
imperfect
nay
she
would
cling
to
it
the
tighter
george
cannon
came
up
the
stairs
with
his
decisive
and
rapid
step
she
rose
from
her
chair
at
the
table
as
he
entered
he
was
wearing
a
new
overcoat
that
she
had
never
seen
before
with
a
fine
velvet
collar
you
going
he
asked
a
little
breathless
i
going
she
replied
in
her
clear
timid
voice
implying
that
she
was
ready
to
stay
everything
all
right
dayson
said
so
he
gone
yes
sowter
gone
too
good
he
murmured
and
he
straightened
his
shoulders
and
putting
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
began
to
walk
about
the
room
hilda
moved
to
get
her
bonnet
and
jacket
she
moved
very
quietly
and
delicately
and
because
he
was
there
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
jacket
with
gestures
of
an
almost
apologetic
modesty
he
seemed
to
ignore
her
so
that
she
was
able
to
glance
surreptitiously
at
his
face
he
was
now
apparently
less
worried
still
it
was
an
enigmatic
face
she
had
no
notion
of
what
he
had
been
doing
since
his
hurried
exit
in
the
afternoon
he
might
have
been
attending
to
his
legal
practice
or
he
might
have
been
abroad
on
mysterious
errands
funny
business
this
newspaper
business
is
is
it
he
remarked
after
a
moment
just
imagine
enville
now
upon
my
soul
i
did
think
he
had
it
in
him
of
course
he
threw
his
head
up
with
a
careless
laugh
of
course
it
would
have
been
madness
for
us
to
miss
such
a
chance
he
one
of
the
men
of
the
future
in
this
town
yes
she
agreed
in
an
eager
whisper
in
an
instant
george
cannon
had
completely
changed
the
attitude
of
her
conscience
by
less
than
a
phrase
by
a
mere
intonation
in
an
instant
he
had
reassured
her
into
perfect
security
it
was
plain
from
every
accent
of
his
voice
that
he
had
done
nothing
of
which
he
thought
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
business
was
business
and
newspapers
were
newspapers
and
the
simple
truth
was
that
her
absurd
conscience
had
been
in
the
wrong
her
duty
was
to
accept
the
standards
of
her
new
world
who
was
she
nobody
she
did
accept
the
standards
of
her
new
world
with
fervour
she
was
proud
of
them
actually
proud
of
their
apparent
wickedness
she
had
accomplished
an
act
of
faith
her
joy
became
intense
and
shot
glinting
from
her
eyes
as
she
put
on
her
gloves
her
life
became
grand
to
her
she
knew
she
was
known
in
the
town
as
girl
who
could
write
shorthand
her
situation
was
not
ordinary
it
was
unique
again
the
irregularity
of
the
hours
and
the
fact
that
the
work
never
commenced
till
the
afternoon
seemed
to
her
romantic
and
beautiful
here
she
was
at
nine
alone
with
george
cannon
on
the
second
floor
of
the
house
and
who
gazing
from
the
square
at
the
lighted
window
would
guess
that
she
and
he
were
there
alone
all
the
activities
of
newspaper
production
were
poetized
by
her
fervour
the
was
not
a
poor
little
weekly
sheet
struggling
into
existence
anyhow
at
haphazard
dependent
on
other
newspapers
for
all
except
purely
local
items
of
news
it
was
an
organ
it
was
the
courageous
rival
of
the
ineffable
its
natural
enemy
one
day
it
would
trample
on
the
and
though
her
rôle
was
humble
though
she
understood
scarcely
anything
of
the
enterprise
beyond
her
own
duties
yet
she
was
very
proud
of
her
rôle
too
and
she
was
glad
that
the
men
were
seemingly
so
careless
so
disorderly
so
forgetful
of
details
so
in
a
word
childish
for
it
was
part
of
her
rôle
to
remind
them
to
set
them
right
to
watch
over
their
carelessness
to
restore
order
where
they
had
left
disorder
in
so
far
as
her
rôle
affected
them
she
condescended
to
them
she
informed
george
cannon
of
her
mother
indisposition
and
that
she
meant
to
go
to
london
the
next
morning
and
to
return
most
probably
in
a
few
days
he
stopped
in
his
walk
near
her
like
herself
he
was
not
seriously
concerned
about
lessways
but
he
showed
a
courteous
sympathy
it
a
good
thing
you
did
go
to
london
when
your
mother
went
he
said
after
a
little
conversation
he
did
not
add
you
been
indispensable
he
had
no
air
of
apologizing
for
his
insult
at
the
but
he
looked
firmly
at
her
with
a
peculiar
expression
suddenly
she
felt
all
her
slimness
and
fragility
she
felt
all
the
girl
in
herself
and
all
the
dominant
man
in
him
and
all
the
empty
space
around
them
she
went
hot
her
sight
became
dim
she
was
ecstatically
blissful
she
was
deeply
ashamed
she
desired
the
experience
to
last
for
ever
and
him
and
herself
to
be
eternally
moveless
and
at
the
same
time
she
desired
to
fly
or
rather
she
had
no
desire
to
fly
but
her
voice
and
limbs
acted
of
themselves
against
her
volition
then
but
i
say
your
wages
shall
i
pay
you
now
no
no
it
does
matter
in
the
least
thanks
he
shook
hands
with
a
careless
smile
which
seemed
to
be
saying
foolish
creature
you
ca
defend
yourself
and
these
airs
are
amusing
but
i
am
benevolent
and
she
was
ashamed
of
her
shame
and
furious
against
the
childishness
that
made
her
frown
and
lower
her
eyes
and
escape
out
of
the
room
like
a
mouse
chapter
xiv
to
london
i
in
the
middle
of
the
night
hilda
woke
up
and
within
a
few
seconds
she
convinced
herself
that
her
attitude
to
miss
gailey
telegram
had
been
simply
monstrous
she
saw
it
in
the
darkness
as
an
enormity
she
ought
to
have
responded
to
the
telegram
at
once
she
ought
to
have
gone
to
london
by
the
afternoon
train
what
had
there
been
to
prevent
her
from
knocking
at
the
door
of
the
inner
room
and
saying
to
cannon
in
the
presence
of
no
matter
whom
i
am
very
sorry
cannon
but
i
just
had
a
telegram
that
mother
is
ill
in
london
and
i
must
leave
by
the
next
train
there
had
been
nothing
to
prevent
her
at
latest
she
should
have
caught
the
evening
train
business
was
of
no
account
in
such
a
crisis
her
mother
might
be
very
ill
might
be
dying
might
be
dead
it
was
not
for
trifles
that
people
sent
such
telegrams
the
astounding
thing
was
that
she
should
have
been
so
blind
to
her
obvious
duty
and
she
said
to
herself
thinking
with
a
mysterious
and
beautiful
remorse
of
the
last
minute
of
her
talk
with
cannon
if
i
had
done
as
i
ought
to
have
done
i
should
have
been
in
london
or
on
my
way
to
london
instead
of
in
the
room
with
him
there
and
would
not
have
occurred
but
what
was
she
could
not
have
explained
nevertheless
cannon
phrase
it
a
good
thing
you
did
go
to
london
still
gave
her
a
pleasure
though
the
pleasure
was
dulled
then
she
tried
to
reassure
herself
sarah
gailey
was
nervous
and
easily
frightened
her
mother
had
an
excellent
constitution
the
notion
of
her
mother
being
seriously
ill
was
silly
in
a
few
hours
she
would
be
with
her
mother
and
would
be
laughing
at
these
absurd
in
any
case
there
would
assuredly
be
a
letter
from
sarah
gailey
by
the
first
post
so
that
before
starting
she
would
have
exact
information
she
succeeded
partially
in
reassuring
herself
for
a
brief
space
but
soon
she
was
more
unhappy
than
ever
in
the
clear
conviction
of
her
wrongdoing
again
and
again
she
formulated
in
her
fancy
scenes
of
the
immediate
future
as
for
example
at
her
mother
dying
bed
and
she
imagined
conversations
and
repeated
the
actual
words
used
by
herself
and
others
interminably
and
then
she
returned
to
the
previous
day
and
hundreds
of
times
she
went
into
the
inner
room
and
said
to
cannon
i
very
sorry
cannon
but
i
just
had
a
telegram
etc
why
had
she
not
said
it
thus
worked
the
shuttles
of
her
mind
with
ruthless
insane
insistence
until
she
knew
not
whether
she
was
awake
or
asleep
and
the
very
tissues
of
her
physical
brain
seemed
raw
she
thought
feebly
if
i
got
up
and
lighted
the
candle
and
walked
about
i
should
end
this
but
she
could
not
rise
she
was
netted
down
to
the
bed
and
when
she
tried
to
soothe
herself
with
other
images
images
of
delight
she
found
that
they
had
lost
their
power
undressing
a
few
hours
earlier
she
had
lived
again
in
exquisite
and
delicious
alarm
through
the
last
minute
of
her
talk
with
cannon
she
had
gone
to
sleep
while
reconstituting
those
instants
but
now
their
memory
left
her
indifferent
even
inspired
repugnance
and
her
remorse
little
by
little
lost
its
mysterious
beauty
she
clung
to
the
idea
of
the
reassuring
letter
which
she
would
receive
that
was
her
sole
glint
of
consolation
ii
at
six
she
was
abroad
in
the
house
intensely
alive
intensely
conscious
of
every
particle
of
her
body
and
of
every
tiniest
operation
of
her
mind
in
less
than
two
hours
the
letter
would
drop
into
the
lobby
at
six
both
she
and
florrie
were
dressed
and
florrie
stern
with
the
solemnity
and
importance
of
her
mission
was
setting
forth
to
the
saracen
head
to
order
a
cab
to
be
at
the
door
at
eight
hilda
had
much
to
do
for
it
was
of
course
necessary
to
shut
up
the
house
and
the
packing
of
her
trunk
had
to
be
finished
and
the
trunk
locked
and
corded
and
a
label
found
and
there
was
breakfast
to
cook
lessways
would
have
easily
passed
a
couple
of
days
in
preparing
the
house
for
closure
nevertheless
time
instead
of
flying
lagged
at
hilda
in
the
partially
dismantled
parlour
and
florrie
in
the
kitchen
were
sitting
down
to
breakfast
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
said
hilda
to
herself
the
post
will
be
here
but
in
four
minutes
she
had
eaten
the
bacon
and
drunk
the
scalding
tea
and
in
five
she
had
carried
all
the
into
the
kitchen
where
florrie
was
loudly
munching
over
the
sloppy
deal
table
she
told
florrie
sharply
that
there
would
be
ample
time
to
wash
up
then
she
went
to
her
bedroom
and
dragging
out
her
trunk
slid
it
unaided
down
the
stairs
back
again
in
the
bedroom
she
carelessly
glanced
at
the
money
in
her
purse
and
then
put
on
her
things
for
the
journey
waiting
she
stood
at
the
window
to
look
for
the
postman
presently
she
saw
him
in
the
distance
he
approached
quickly
but
spent
an
unendurable
minute
out
of
sight
in
the
shop
next
door
when
he
emerged
hilda
was
in
anguish
had
he
a
letter
for
her
had
he
not
he
seemed
to
waver
at
the
gateway
and
to
decide
to
enter
she
heard
the
double
blow
of
his
drumstick
baton
now
in
a
few
seconds
she
would
know
about
her
mother
proudly
restraining
herself
she
walked
with
composure
to
the
stairs
she
was
astonished
to
see
florrie
bending
down
to
pick
up
the
letter
florrie
must
have
been
waiting
ready
to
rush
to
the
front
door
as
she
raised
her
body
and
caught
sight
of
hilda
florrie
blushed
the
stairs
were
blocked
by
the
trunk
which
hilda
had
left
on
the
for
the
cabman
to
deal
with
standing
behind
the
trunk
hilda
held
forth
her
hand
for
the
letter
please
miss
it
for
me
florrie
whispered
like
a
criminal
for
you
hilda
cried
startled
in
proof
florrie
timidly
exposed
the
envelope
on
which
hilda
plainly
saw
in
a
coarse
scrawling
masculine
hand
the
words
miss
florrie
bagster
florrie
face
was
a
burning
peony
hilda
turned
superciliously
away
too
proud
to
demand
any
explanations
all
her
alarms
were
refreshed
by
the
failure
of
a
letter
from
miss
gailey
in
vain
she
urged
to
herself
that
miss
gailey
had
thought
it
unnecessary
to
write
expecting
to
see
her
or
that
the
illness
having
passed
miss
gailey
busy
had
put
off
writing
she
could
not
dismiss
a
vision
of
a
in
london
upset
from
top
to
bottom
by
the
grave
illness
of
one
person
in
it
and
a
distracted
landlady
who
had
not
a
moment
even
to
scribble
a
post
card
and
all
the
time
as
this
vision
tore
and
desolated
her
she
was
thinking
fancy
that
child
having
a
follower
at
her
age
she
certainly
got
a
follower
the
cab
came
five
minutes
before
it
was
due
iii
as
the
cab
rolled
through
market
square
where
the
saturday
stalls
were
being
busily
set
up
the
ironmongery
building
was
framed
for
an
instant
by
the
oblong
of
the
rattling
window
hilda
seemed
to
see
the
place
anew
for
the
first
time
a
man
was
taking
down
the
shutters
of
the
shop
above
that
were
the
with
the
name
of
karkeek
and
above
the
blinds
the
blue
posters
of
the
towns
no
outward
sign
of
cannon
and
yet
cannon
she
had
an
extremely
disconcerting
sensation
of
the
mysteriousness
of
cannon
and
of
the
mysteriousness
of
all
existence
cannon
existed
somewhere
at
that
moment
engaged
in
some
activity
in
a
house
afar
off
unknown
to
her
her
mother
existed
if
she
was
not
dead
florrie
with
a
bundle
of
personal
goods
on
her
lap
and
doubtless
the
letter
in
her
bosom
sat
impressed
and
subdued
opposite
to
her
in
the
shifting
universe
of
the
cab
which
was
moving
away
from
the
empty
and
silent
home
florrie
was
being
thrown
back
out
of
luxury
into
her
original
hovel
and
was
accepting
the
stroke
with
the
fatalism
of
the
young
and
of
the
poor
and
one
day
hilda
and
her
mother
and
florrie
would
be
united
again
in
the
home
now
deserted
whose
heavy
key
was
in
the
traveller
satchel
but
would
they
at
the
station
there
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
wait
hilda
dismissed
florrie
with
final
injunctions
and
followed
her
trunk
to
the
bleak
platform
the
old
porter
was
very
kind
she
went
to
the
little
yellow
bookstall
there
under
her
hand
was
a
low
pile
of
five
towns
miracle
miraculous
george
cannon
she
flushed
with
pride
with
a
sense
of
ownership
as
she
took
a
penny
from
her
purse
to
pay
for
a
copy
it
th
new
peeper
drawled
the
bookstall
lad
with
a
most
foolish
condescension
towards
the
new
paper
lout
she
addressed
him
in
her
heart
if
you
knew
whom
you
were
talking
to
with
what
pride
masked
by
careful
indifference
she
would
hand
the
copy
of
the
to
her
mother
her
mother
would
exclaim
bless
us
and
spend
a
day
or
two
in
conning
the
thing
making
singular
discoveries
in
it
at
short
intervals
iv
it
was
not
until
she
had
reached
euston
and
driven
through
a
tumultuous
and
shabby
thoroughfare
to
king
cross
and
taken
another
ticket
and
installed
herself
in
another
train
that
hilda
began
to
feel
suddenly
like
an
abyss
opening
beneath
her
strength
the
lack
of
food
meticulous
in
her
clerical
duties
and
in
many
minor
mechanical
details
of
her
personal
daily
existence
she
was
capable
of
singular
negligences
concerning
matters
which
the
heroic
part
of
her
despised
and
which
did
not
immediately
bear
on
a
great
purpose
in
hand
thus
in
her
carelessness
she
found
herself
with
less
than
two
shillings
in
her
pocket
after
paying
for
the
ticket
to
hornsey
she
thought
grimly
resigned
never
heed
i
shall
manage
in
half
an
hour
i
shall
be
there
and
my
anxiety
will
be
at
an
end
the
train
almost
empty
waited
forlornly
in
a
forlorn
and
empty
part
of
the
huge
resounding
ochreish
station
then
without
warning
or
signal
it
slipped
off
as
though
casually
towards
an
undetermined
goal
often
it
ran
level
with
the
roofs
of
vague
acres
of
houses
houses
vile
and
frowsy
and
smoking
like
pyres
in
the
dank
air
and
always
it
travelled
on
a
platform
of
brick
arches
now
and
then
the
walled
road
received
a
tributary
that
rounded
subtly
into
it
and
this
tributary
could
be
seen
curving
away
on
innumerable
brick
arches
through
the
chimneypots
and
losing
itself
in
a
dim
horizon
of
gloom
at
intervals
a
large
lifeless
station
brought
the
train
to
a
halt
for
a
moment
and
the
march
was
resumed
a
clock
at
one
of
these
stations
said
a
quarter
to
two
then
the
name
of
hornsey
quickened
her
apprehensive
heart
as
she
descended
nervously
from
the
train
her
trunk
was
shot
out
from
the
guard
van
behind
she
went
and
stood
over
it
until
the
last
of
a
series
of
kindly
porters
came
along
and
touched
his
cap
when
she
asked
for
a
cab
he
seemed
doubtful
whether
a
cab
was
available
and
looked
uncertainly
along
the
immense
empty
platform
and
across
at
other
platforms
the
train
had
wandered
away
she
strove
momentarily
to
understand
the
reason
of
these
great
sleeping
stations
but
fatigue
emotional
and
physical
had
robbed
her
of
all
intelligent
curiosity
in
the
phenomena
of
the
mysterious
and
formidable
city
presently
the
porter
threw
the
trunk
on
his
shoulder
and
she
trudged
after
him
up
steps
and
over
an
iron
bridge
and
down
steps
and
an
express
whizzed
like
a
flying
shell
through
the
station
and
vanished
and
at
a
wicket
in
a
ragged
road
there
actually
stood
a
cab
and
a
skeleton
of
a
horse
between
the
shafts
the
driver
bounced
up
enheartened
at
sight
of
the
trunk
and
the
inexperienced
timid
girl
but
the
horse
did
not
stir
in
its
crooked
coma
what
address
miss
asked
the
cabman
cedars
house
harringay
park
road
the
cabman
paused
in
intense
thought
and
after
a
few
seconds
responded
cheerfully
yes
miss
the
porter
touched
his
cap
for
threepence
the
lashed
horse
plunged
forward
hilda
leaned
back
in
the
creaking
and
depraved
vehicle
and
sighed
so
this
is
their
london
she
found
herself
travelling
in
the
direction
from
which
she
had
come
parallel
to
the
railway
down
the
longest
street
that
she
had
ever
seen
on
her
left
were
ten
thousand
small
new
houses
all
alike
on
her
right
were
broken
patches
of
similar
houses
interspersed
with
fragments
of
green
field
and
views
of
the
arches
of
the
railway
the
conception
of
the
horrible
patience
which
had
gone
to
the
construction
of
these
endless
endless
arches
made
her
feel
sick
the
cab
turned
into
another
road
and
another
and
then
stopped
she
saw
the
words
cedars
house
on
a
gateway
she
could
not
open
the
door
of
the
cab
the
cabman
opened
it
blinds
down
here
miss
he
said
with
appropriate
mournfulness
it
seemed
a
rather
large
house
and
every
blind
was
drawn
had
the
incredible
occurred
then
had
this
disaster
befallen
just
her
of
all
the
young
women
in
the
world
she
saw
the
figure
of
sarah
gailey
good
afternoon
she
called
out
calmly
here
i
am
only
i
afraid
i
have
got
enough
to
pay
the
cabman
but
while
she
was
speaking
she
knew
from
sarah
gailey
face
that
the
worst
and
the
most
ridiculous
of
her
had
been
justified
by
destiny
three
days
previously
lessways
had
been
suddenly
taken
ill
in
the
street
a
doctor
passing
in
his
carriage
had
come
to
her
assistance
and
driven
her
home
food
eaten
on
the
previous
evening
had
with
her
at
first
the
case
was
not
regarded
as
very
serious
but
as
the
patient
did
not
improve
in
the
night
miss
gailey
telegraphed
to
hilda
immediately
afterwards
the
doctor
summoned
in
alarm
diagnosed
peritonitis
caused
by
a
perforating
cancer
lessways
had
died
on
the
third
day
at
eleven
in
the
morning
while
hilda
was
in
the
train
useless
to
protest
that
these
catastrophes
were
unthinkable
that
lessways
had
never
been
ill
in
her
life
the
catastrophe
had
happened
and
upstairs
a
corpse
lay
in
proof
book
ii
her
recovery
chapter
i
sin
i
from
her
bed
hilda
could
see
the
trees
waving
in
the
wind
every
morning
she
had
thus
watched
them
without
interest
at
first
the
branches
had
been
utterly
bare
and
beyond
their
reticulation
had
been
visible
the
rosy
façade
of
a
new
but
now
the
branches
were
rich
with
leafage
hiding
most
of
the
so
that
only
a
large
upper
window
of
it
could
be
seen
this
window
upon
which
the
sun
glinted
dazzlingly
threw
back
the
rays
on
to
hilda
bed
giving
her
for
a
few
moments
the
illusion
of
direct
sunlight
the
hour
was
eleven
on
the
lay
a
in
disorder
and
on
the
sheet
some
crumbs
of
toast
a
low
nervous
tap
at
the
door
caused
hilda
to
stir
in
the
bed
sarah
gailey
entered
hurriedly
in
her
bony
yellowed
hand
she
held
a
collection
of
tradesmen
good
morning
dear
how
are
you
she
asked
bending
awkwardly
over
the
bed
in
the
same
instant
she
looked
askance
at
the
tray
i
all
right
thanks
said
hilda
lazily
observing
the
ceiling
you
have
been
too
cold
without
the
eiderdown
i
forgot
to
ask
you
before
you
know
i
only
took
it
off
because
i
thought
the
weather
was
getting
too
warm
i
did
want
it
for
another
bed
i
assure
you
in
the
chest
of
drawers
in
my
room
sarah
gailey
added
the
last
words
as
if
supplicating
to
be
believed
you
need
tell
me
that
said
hilda
she
was
not
angry
but
bored
by
this
characteristic
remark
of
miss
gailey
in
three
months
she
had
learnt
a
great
deal
about
the
new
landlady
of
the
cedars
that
strange
neurotic
compound
of
ability
devotion
vanity
and
sheer
narrow
stupidity
i
been
quite
warm
enough
hilda
added
as
quickly
as
she
could
lest
miss
gailey
might
have
time
to
convince
herself
to
the
contrary
and
the
toast
i
do
hope
after
all
i
said
to
that
hettie
about
you
see
i
eaten
it
all
hilda
interrupted
her
pointing
to
the
plate
their
faces
were
close
together
they
exchanged
a
sad
smile
miss
gailey
was
still
bending
over
her
anxiously
as
over
a
child
yet
neither
the
ageing
and
worn
woman
nor
the
flaccid
girl
felt
the
difference
between
them
in
age
nor
was
hilda
in
any
ordinary
sense
ill
the
explanation
of
miss
gailey
yearning
attitude
lay
in
an
exaggerated
idea
of
her
duty
to
hilda
whose
mother
death
had
been
the
result
of
an
act
of
friendliness
to
her
if
lessways
had
not
come
to
london
in
order
to
keep
company
with
sarah
she
might
she
would
under
providence
have
been
alive
and
well
that
day
such
was
sarah
reasoning
which
by
the
way
ignored
certain
statements
of
the
doctor
sarah
would
never
forgive
herself
but
she
sought
by
an
infatuated
devotion
to
earn
the
forgiveness
of
caroline
daughter
her
attentions
might
have
infuriated
an
earlier
hilda
or
at
least
have
been
met
with
disdain
only
half
concealed
but
on
the
present
actual
hilda
they
produced
simply
no
effect
of
any
kind
the
actual
hilda
living
far
within
the
mysterious
fastness
of
her
own
being
was
too
solitary
too
preoccupied
and
too
fatigued
to
be
touched
even
by
the
noble
beauty
that
distinguished
the
expiatory
and
protective
gesture
of
the
spinster
otherwise
somewhat
ludicrous
as
she
leaned
across
the
bed
and
cut
off
the
sunshine
ii
on
the
morning
of
her
mother
funeral
hilda
had
gone
to
hornsey
station
to
meet
an
uncle
of
lessways
who
was
coming
down
from
scotland
by
the
she
scarcely
knew
him
but
he
was
to
be
recognizable
by
his
hat
and
his
muffler
and
she
was
to
await
him
at
the
an
entirely
foolish
and
unnecessary
arrangement
contrived
by
a
peculiar
old
man
the
only
possible
course
was
to
accept
it
she
had
waited
over
half
an
hour
between
eight
and
nine
and
in
that
time
she
had
had
full
opportunity
to
understand
why
those
suburban
stations
had
been
built
so
large
a
dark
torrent
of
human
beings
chiefly
men
gathered
out
of
all
the
streets
of
the
vicinity
had
dashed
unceasingly
into
the
enclosure
and
covered
the
long
platforms
with
tramping
feet
every
few
minutes
a
train
rolled
in
as
if
from
some
inexhaustible
magazine
of
trains
beyond
the
horizon
and
sucking
into
itself
a
multitude
and
departing
again
left
one
platform
for
one
moment
empty
and
the
next
moment
the
platform
was
once
more
filled
by
the
quenchless
stream
less
frequently
but
still
often
other
trains
thundered
through
the
station
on
a
line
removed
from
platforms
and
these
trains
too
were
crammed
with
dark
human
beings
frowning
in
study
over
white
newspapers
for
even
in
the
descent
upon
london
from
the
suburbs
was
a
formidable
phenomenon
train
after
train
fled
downwards
with
its
freight
towards
the
hidden
city
and
the
torrent
still
surged
more
rapid
than
ever
through
the
narrow
gullet
of
the
station
it
was
like
the
flight
of
some
enormous
and
excited
population
from
a
country
menaced
with
disaster
borne
on
and
buffeted
by
the
torrent
hilda
had
seen
a
epileptic
youth
in
charge
of
an
elderly
woman
approaching
the
station
he
had
passed
slowly
close
by
her
as
she
modestly
waited
in
her
hasty
mourning
and
she
had
had
a
fearful
vision
of
his
idiotic
greenish
face
supported
somehow
like
a
mask
at
the
summit
of
that
shaky
structure
of
limbs
he
had
indeed
stared
at
her
with
his
apelike
eyes
she
had
watched
him
almost
shuddering
till
he
was
lost
amid
the
heedless
crowd
within
then
without
waiting
longer
for
her
relative
without
reflecting
upon
what
she
did
she
had
walked
tremblingly
back
to
the
cedars
checked
by
tributaries
of
the
torrent
at
every
street
corner
she
had
known
nothing
of
the
funeral
she
had
not
had
speech
with
the
relative
she
was
in
bed
somehow
the
day
had
elapsed
and
in
the
following
night
when
she
was
alone
and
quite
awake
she
had
become
aware
that
she
she
herself
was
that
epileptic
shape
that
that
epileptic
shape
was
lying
in
her
bed
and
that
there
was
none
other
in
the
bed
nor
was
this
a
fancy
of
madness
she
knew
that
she
was
not
mad
that
she
was
utterly
sane
and
the
conviction
of
sanity
only
intensified
her
awful
discovery
she
passed
a
trembling
hand
over
her
face
and
felt
the
skin
corrupt
and
green
gazing
into
the
darkness
she
knew
that
her
stare
was
apelike
she
had
felt
then
the
fullest
significance
of
horror
in
the
morning
she
had
ceased
to
be
the
epileptic
shape
but
the
risk
of
had
hovered
near
her
and
the
intimidation
of
it
was
such
that
she
had
wept
aghast
and
broken
as
much
by
the
future
as
by
the
past
she
had
been
discovered
weeping
later
the
phrase
breakdown
had
lodged
in
her
confused
memory
the
doctor
had
been
very
logical
and
soothing
overwork
strain
loss
of
sleep
the
journey
anxiety
lack
of
food
the
supreme
shock
the
obstinate
refusal
of
youth
to
succumb
and
then
the
sudden
sight
of
the
epileptic
with
whom
the
doctor
was
acquainted
thus
had
run
the
medical
reasoning
after
a
discreet
but
thorough
of
her
and
it
had
seemed
so
plausible
and
so
convincing
that
the
doctor
pride
in
it
was
plain
on
his
optimistic
face
as
he
gave
the
command
absolute
repose
but
to
hilda
the
reasoning
and
the
resultant
phrase
breakdown
had
meant
nothing
at
all
words
empty
words
she
knew
profoundly
and
fatally
the
evil
principle
which
had
conquered
her
so
completely
that
she
had
no
power
left
with
which
to
fight
it
this
evil
principle
was
sin
it
was
not
the
force
of
sins
however
multifarious
it
was
sin
itself
she
was
the
sinner
convicted
and
one
of
the
last
intelligent
victims
of
a
malady
which
has
now
almost
passed
away
from
the
civilized
earth
she
existed
in
the
chill
and
stricken
desolation
of
incommutable
doom
iii
she
had
sinned
against
her
mother
and
she
could
not
make
amends
the
mere
thought
of
her
mother
so
vivacious
cheerful
charitable
disorderly
incompetent
foolish
and
yet
shrewd
caused
pain
of
such
intensity
that
it
ceased
to
be
pain
she
ought
to
have
seen
her
mother
before
she
died
she
might
have
seen
her
had
she
done
what
was
obviously
her
duty
it
was
inconceivable
to
her
now
that
she
should
have
hesitated
to
fly
instantly
to
london
on
receipt
of
the
telegram
but
she
had
hesitated
and
her
mother
had
expired
without
having
sight
of
her
all
exculpatory
arguments
were
futile
against
the
fact
itself
in
vain
she
blamed
the
wording
of
the
telegram
in
vain
she
tried
to
reason
that
chance
and
not
herself
was
the
in
vain
she
invoked
the
aid
of
simple
common
sense
against
sentimental
fancy
in
vain
she
went
over
the
events
of
the
afternoon
preceding
the
death
in
order
to
prove
that
at
no
moment
had
she
been
aware
of
not
acting
in
accordance
with
her
conscience
the
whole
of
her
conduct
had
been
against
her
conscience
but
pride
and
selfishness
had
made
her
deaf
to
conscience
she
was
the
sinner
her
despair
except
when
at
intervals
she
became
the
loathed
epileptic
shape
had
been
calm
its
symptoms
had
been
and
remained
a
complete
lack
of
energy
and
a
most
extraordinary
black
indifference
to
the
surrounding
world
save
in
the
deep
centre
of
her
soul
where
she
agonized
she
seemed
to
have
lost
all
capacity
for
emotion
nothing
moved
her
or
even
interested
her
she
sat
in
the
house
and
ate
a
little
and
talked
a
little
like
an
automaton
she
walked
about
the
streets
like
a
bored
exile
but
an
exile
who
has
forgotten
his
home
her
spirit
never
responded
to
the
stimulus
of
environment
suggestions
at
once
lost
their
tonic
force
in
the
woolly
cushion
of
her
apathy
if
she
continued
to
live
it
was
by
inertia
to
cease
from
life
would
have
required
an
effort
she
did
not
regret
the
vocation
which
she
had
abandoned
she
felt
no
curiosity
about
the
fortunes
of
the
newspaper
a
tragic
nonchalance
held
her
after
several
weeks
she
had
naturally
begun
to
think
of
religion
for
the
malady
alone
was
proof
enough
that
she
had
a
profoundly
religious
nature
miss
gailey
could
rarely
go
to
church
but
one
sunday
morning
doubtless
with
intent
she
asked
hilda
if
they
should
go
together
and
hilda
agreed
as
they
approached
the
large
church
hilda
had
vague
prickings
of
hope
and
was
thereby
much
astonished
but
the
service
in
no
way
responded
to
her
expectations
how
silly
i
am
she
thought
disdainfully
this
sort
of
thing
has
never
moved
me
before
why
should
it
move
me
now
the
sermon
evangelical
was
upon
the
creed
and
the
preacher
explained
the
emotional
quality
of
real
belief
it
was
a
goodish
sermon
but
the
preacher
had
effectually
stopped
the
very
last
of
those
exquisite
vague
prickings
of
hope
hilda
agreed
with
his
definition
of
real
belief
and
she
knew
that
real
belief
was
impossible
for
her
she
could
never
say
with
joyous
fervour
i
believe
at
best
she
could
only
assert
that
she
did
not
disbelieve
and
was
she
so
sure
even
of
that
no
belief
had
been
denied
to
her
and
to
dream
of
consolation
from
religion
was
sentimentally
womanish
even
in
her
indifference
she
preferred
straightforward
honest
damnation
to
the
soft
of
feminine
religiosity
ah
if
she
could
have
been
a
roman
catholic
genuine
and
convinced
with
what
ardour
would
she
have
cast
herself
down
before
the
confessional
and
whispered
her
sinfulness
to
the
mysterious
face
within
and
with
what
ecstasy
would
she
have
received
the
absolution
that
cleansing
bath
of
the
soul
then
she
could
have
recommenced
but
she
was
not
a
roman
catholic
she
could
no
more
become
a
roman
catholic
than
she
could
become
the
queen
of
some
romantic
latin
country
of
palaces
and
cathedrals
she
was
a
young
provincial
girl
staying
in
a
at
hornsey
on
the
great
northern
line
out
of
london
and
she
was
suffering
from
nervous
breakdown
such
was
the
exterior
common
sense
of
the
situation
occasionally
the
memory
of
some
verse
of
victor
hugo
sounding
the
beat
of
one
of
his
vast
melancholies
would
float
through
her
mind
and
cause
it
to
vibrate
for
an
instant
with
a
mournful
sensation
that
resembled
pleasure
iv
are
you
thinking
of
getting
up
dear
asked
sarah
gailey
as
she
arranged
more
securely
the
contents
of
the
tray
and
found
space
on
it
for
her
weekly
books
yes
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
hilda
murmured
it
be
soon
the
days
were
long
yet
somehow
they
seemed
short
too
already
before
getting
up
she
would
begin
to
think
of
the
evening
and
of
going
to
bed
and
saturday
night
followed
quickly
on
monday
morning
it
was
scarcely
credible
that
sixteen
weeks
had
passed
thus
since
her
mother
death
sixteen
weeks
whose
retrospect
showed
no
achievement
of
any
kind
and
hardly
a
desire
i
given
those
boutwoods
notice
said
sarah
gailey
suddenly
the
tray
in
her
hands
ready
to
lift
not
really
they
were
shockingly
late
for
breakfast
again
this
morning
both
of
them
and
boutwood
had
the
face
to
ask
for
another
egg
hettie
came
and
told
me
so
i
went
in
myself
i
told
him
breakfast
was
served
in
my
house
at
nine
and
there
was
a
notice
to
that
effect
in
the
bedrooms
not
to
mention
the
and
as
good
a
breakfast
as
they
get
in
any
of
their
hotels
i
lay
if
the
eggs
are
cold
at
ten
and
after
that
not
my
fault
they
both
of
them
perfectly
healthy
and
yet
they
they
never
want
to
go
to
bed
and
they
never
want
to
get
up
it
is
as
if
they
went
to
theatres
and
got
home
late
and
so
on
i
could
make
excuses
for
that
now
and
then
no
it
just
idleness
and
carelessness
and
if
you
saw
their
bedroom
oh
my
a
nice
example
to
servants
well
he
was
very
insulting
most
insulting
he
said
he
paid
me
to
give
him
not
what
i
wanted
but
what
wanted
he
said
if
i
went
into
a
shop
and
they
began
to
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
want
and
when
i
ought
to
want
it
i
should
be
annoyed
i
said
i
did
need
anyone
to
tell
me
that
i
said
and
my
house
was
a
shop
he
said
it
was
a
shop
and
if
it
was
it
ought
to
be
can
you
imagine
it
hilda
tried
to
exhibit
a
tepid
sympathy
miss
gailey
nostrils
were
twitching
and
the
tears
stood
in
those
watery
eyes
she
could
manage
the
house
by
the
exertion
of
all
her
powers
and
her
force
she
had
made
of
herself
an
exceptionally
efficient
mistress
but
she
could
not
manage
the
boarders
because
she
had
not
sufficient
imagination
to
put
herself
in
their
place
presiding
over
all
her
secret
thoughts
was
the
axiom
that
the
cedars
was
a
perfect
machine
and
that
the
least
that
a
grateful
boarder
could
do
was
to
fit
into
the
machine
and
so
you
said
they
could
go
that
i
did
and
i
tell
you
another
thing
my
dear
i
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
sarah
gailey
stopped
in
her
confidences
like
a
caught
conspirator
and
opened
the
door
hettie
stood
on
the
mat
the
hettie
who
despite
frequent
protests
would
leave
hilda
toast
to
cool
into
leather
on
the
landing
somewhere
between
the
kitchen
and
the
bedroom
in
hettie
hand
was
a
telegram
which
miss
gailey
accepted
here
take
the
tray
hettie
said
she
nervously
tearing
at
the
envelope
put
these
books
in
my
desk
she
added
and
i
wonder
what
say
she
observed
staring
absently
at
the
opened
telegram
after
hettie
had
gone
who
george
he
says
he
be
up
here
for
lunch
he
bound
to
be
vexed
about
the
boutwoods
but
he
does
understand
men
do
you
know
they
do
understand
the
strain
it
is
on
you
the
appeal
of
her
eyes
was
strangely
pathetic
hilda
said
i
do
think
i
shall
get
up
for
lunch
sarah
gailey
moved
to
the
bed
forgetting
her
own
trouble
you
are
so
well
then
after
all
she
muttered
with
mournful
commiseration
but
you
know
he
have
to
see
you
time
he
wants
to
but
why
your
affairs
i
suppose
he
says
so
lunch
one
must
see
george
sarah
gailey
offered
the
telegram
but
hilda
could
not
bear
to
take
it
this
telegram
was
the
first
she
had
set
eyes
on
since
the
telegram
handed
to
her
by
florrie
in
george
cannon
office
the
mere
sight
of
the
paper
agitated
her
is
it
possible
that
i
can
be
so
silly
she
thought
over
a
bit
of
paper
but
so
it
was
on
a
previous
visit
of
george
cannon
to
hornsey
she
had
kept
her
bed
throughout
the
day
afraid
to
meet
him
ashamed
to
meet
him
inexplicably
convinced
that
to
meet
him
would
be
a
crime
against
filial
piety
there
were
obscure
grottoes
in
her
soul
which
she
had
not
had
the
courage
to
explore
candidly
i
think
said
sarah
gailey
reflective
and
anxious
i
think
if
you
get
up
it
would
be
nicer
than
him
seeing
you
here
in
bed
hilda
perceived
that
at
last
she
would
be
compelled
to
face
george
cannon
chapter
ii
the
little
room
i
after
lunch
sarah
gailey
left
hilda
and
cannon
in
little
together
little
room
about
eight
feet
square
had
no
other
name
it
was
always
spoken
of
affectionately
by
the
boarders
and
by
the
landlady
with
pride
in
its
coziness
situated
on
the
first
floor
over
the
front
part
of
the
hall
it
lay
between
the
two
principal
bedrooms
old
boarders
would
discover
the
little
room
to
new
boarders
or
new
boarders
would
discover
it
for
themselves
with
immense
satisfaction
it
was
the
chamber
of
intimacy
and
of
confidences
it
was
a
refuge
from
the
public
life
of
the
cedars
and
to
a
certain
extent
from
the
piano
two
women
newly
acquainted
and
feeling
a
mutual
attraction
would
say
to
each
other
shall
we
go
up
to
the
little
room
oh
yes
do
let
us
and
they
would
climb
the
stairs
in
a
fever
of
anticipation
quite
the
most
charming
room
in
the
house
dear
miss
gailey
another
simpering
spinster
would
say
yet
it
contained
nothing
but
an
old
carpet
two
wicker
a
small
chair
a
nearly
empty
dwarf
bookcase
an
engraving
of
marie
antoinette
regally
facing
the
revolutionary
mob
and
a
couple
of
photographs
of
the
cedars
hilda
sat
down
in
one
of
the
and
george
cannon
in
the
other
he
had
a
small
black
bag
which
he
placed
on
the
floor
by
his
side
hilda
diffidence
was
extreme
throughout
lunch
she
had
scarcely
spoken
but
as
there
had
been
eight
people
at
the
table
and
george
cannon
had
chatted
with
all
of
them
her
taciturnity
had
passed
inconspicuous
now
she
would
be
obliged
to
talk
and
the
sensations
which
she
had
experienced
on
first
meeting
george
cannon
in
the
were
renewed
in
a
form
even
more
acute
she
had
in
the
first
place
the
due
to
her
mourning
attire
which
drew
attention
to
herself
it
might
have
been
a
compromising
uniform
and
the
mere
fact
of
her
mother
death
quite
apart
from
the
question
of
her
conduct
in
relation
thereto
gave
her
in
an
interview
with
a
person
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
before
the
death
a
feeling
akin
to
guiltiness
guiltiness
of
some
misdemeanour
of
taste
some
infraction
of
the
social
law
against
notoriety
she
felt
in
her
mourning
like
one
who
is
being
led
publicly
by
policemen
to
the
in
her
fancy
she
could
hear
people
saying
look
at
that
girl
in
deep
mourning
and
she
could
see
herself
blushing
as
it
were
apologetic
but
much
worse
than
this
general
mortification
in
presence
of
an
acquaintance
seen
after
a
long
interval
was
the
special
constraint
due
to
the
identity
of
the
acquaintance
it
was
with
george
cannon
that
she
had
first
deceived
and
plotted
against
her
ingenuous
mother
hasty
plans
it
was
her
loyalty
to
george
cannon
that
had
been
the
cause
of
her
inexplicable
disloyalty
to
her
mother
she
could
not
recall
her
peculiar
and
delicious
agitations
during
the
final
moments
of
her
previous
interview
with
cannon
that
night
of
february
in
the
newspaper
office
while
her
mother
was
dying
in
london
without
a
profound
unreasoning
shame
which
intensified
most
painfully
her
natural
grief
as
an
orphan
there
was
this
to
be
said
she
was
now
disturbed
out
of
her
torpid
indifference
to
her
environment
as
she
fidgeted
there
pale
and
frowning
in
the
noisy
beneath
george
cannon
eyes
she
actually
perceived
again
that
romantic
quality
of
existence
which
had
always
so
powerfully
presented
itself
to
her
in
the
past
she
reflected
how
strange
that
the
dreaded
scene
has
now
actually
begun
he
has
come
to
london
and
here
we
are
together
in
this
house
which
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
was
nothing
but
a
name
to
me
and
mother
is
away
there
in
the
churchyard
and
i
am
in
black
and
it
is
all
due
to
him
he
sent
miss
gailey
and
mother
to
london
he
willed
it
no
it
is
all
due
to
me
i
went
to
see
him
one
late
afternoon
i
sought
him
out
he
did
seek
me
out
and
just
because
i
went
to
see
him
one
afternoon
mother
is
dead
and
i
am
here
strange
these
reflections
were
dimly
beautiful
to
her
even
in
her
sadness
and
in
her
acute
distress
the
coma
had
assuredly
passed
if
only
for
a
space
ii
well
now
he
said
after
a
few
inanities
had
been
succeeded
by
an
awkward
pause
i
got
to
talk
business
with
you
so
i
suppose
we
may
as
well
begin
eh
his
tone
was
fairly
blithe
but
it
was
that
of
a
man
who
was
throwing
off
with
powerful
ease
the
weariness
of
somewhat
exasperating
annoyances
since
lunch
he
had
had
a
brief
interview
with
sarah
gailey
yes
she
agreed
glumly
have
you
decided
what
you
going
to
do
he
began
to
smile
sympathetically
as
he
spoke
i
not
going
back
to
the
paper
she
curtly
answered
cutting
short
the
smile
with
fierceness
almost
with
ferocity
beyond
question
she
was
rude
in
her
bitterness
she
asked
herself
why
do
i
talk
like
this
why
ca
i
talk
naturally
and
gently
and
cheerfully
i
really
got
nothing
against
him
but
she
could
not
talk
otherwise
than
she
did
talk
it
was
by
this
symptom
of
biting
acrimony
that
her
agitation
showed
itself
she
knew
that
she
was
scowling
as
she
looked
at
the
opposite
wall
but
she
could
not
smooth
away
the
scowl
no
i
suppose
not
he
said
quietly
but
are
you
thinking
of
coming
back
to
turnhill
she
remained
mute
for
some
seconds
a
feeling
of
desolation
came
over
her
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
welcomed
it
trying
to
intensify
it
and
yielding
her
features
to
it
how
do
i
know
she
muttered
at
length
shrugging
her
shoulders
because
if
you
are
he
resumed
it
no
use
you
keeping
that
house
of
yours
empty
you
must
remember
it
just
as
you
left
it
and
the
things
in
it
are
taking
any
good
either
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
again
i
do
see
that
it
matters
to
anybody
but
me
she
said
after
another
pause
with
a
sort
of
frigid
and
disdainful
nonchalance
and
once
more
she
reflected
is
it
possible
that
i
can
behave
so
odiously
he
stood
up
suddenly
i
do
know
what
you
and
sarah
have
been
plotting
together
he
said
wounded
and
contemptuous
yet
with
lightness
but
i
sure
i
do
want
to
interfere
in
your
affairs
with
sarah
i
got
to
interfere
unfortunately
and
a
famous
time
i
having
his
nostrils
grew
fastidious
but
not
yours
i
only
promised
your
uncle
your
uncle
told
me
you
wanted
me
to
he
broke
off
in
an
instant
she
grew
confused
alarmed
and
extremely
ashamed
her
mood
had
changed
in
a
flash
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
in
presence
of
a
disgraceful
disaster
which
she
herself
had
brought
about
by
wicked
and
irresponsible
temerity
she
was
like
a
child
who
having
naughtily
trifled
with
danger
stands
aghast
at
the
calamity
which
his
perverseness
has
caused
she
was
positively
affrighted
she
reflected
in
her
terror
i
asked
for
this
and
i
got
it
george
cannon
stooped
and
picked
up
his
little
bag
there
he
towered
high
and
massive
above
her
and
she
felt
acutely
her
slightness
her
girlishness
and
her
need
of
his
help
she
could
not
afford
to
transform
sympathy
into
antipathy
she
was
alone
in
the
world
never
before
had
she
realized
as
she
realized
then
the
lurking
terror
of
her
loneliness
the
moment
was
critical
in
another
moment
he
might
be
gone
from
the
room
and
she
left
solitary
to
irremediable
humiliation
and
please
she
whispered
appealingly
the
whole
of
her
being
became
an
appeal
the
glance
the
gesture
the
curve
of
the
slim
and
fragile
body
she
was
like
a
slave
she
had
no
pride
no
secret
reserve
of
thought
she
was
an
instinct
tears
showed
in
her
eyes
and
affected
her
voice
he
gave
the
twisted
difficult
rather
foolish
smile
of
one
who
is
cursing
the
mortification
of
a
predicament
into
which
he
has
been
cast
through
no
fault
of
his
own
please
what
please
sit
down
he
waved
a
hand
deprecatingly
and
obeyed
it
all
right
he
said
all
right
i
ought
to
have
known
then
he
smiled
generously
known
what
her
voice
was
now
weak
and
liquid
with
woe
you
be
likely
to
be
upset
not
furtively
but
openly
she
wiped
her
eyes
no
no
she
protested
honestly
it
not
that
it
but
i
very
sorry
i
reckon
i
know
a
bit
what
worry
is
myself
he
added
with
a
brief
almost
harsh
laugh
these
strange
words
struck
her
with
pity
iii
well
now
he
seemed
to
be
beginning
again
let
leave
lessways
street
for
a
minute
i
can
sell
the
calder
street
property
for
you
if
you
like
and
at
a
pretty
good
price
sooner
or
later
the
town
will
have
to
buy
up
all
that
side
of
the
street
you
remember
i
told
your
mother
last
year
but
one
i
could
get
a
customer
for
it
but
she
having
any
yes
said
hilda
eagerly
i
remember
in
her
heart
she
apologized
to
george
cannon
once
more
for
having
allowed
her
mother
to
persuade
her
even
for
a
day
that
that
attempt
to
buy
was
merely
a
trick
on
his
part
invented
to
open
negotiations
for
the
you
know
what
the
net
rents
are
he
went
on
as
you
had
every
month
i
dare
say
the
purchase
money
if
it
carefully
invested
will
bring
you
in
as
much
but
even
if
it
does
bring
in
quite
as
much
you
must
forget
that
calder
street
going
down
it
getting
more
and
more
of
a
slum
and
there
always
be
a
lot
of
bother
with
tenants
of
that
class
i
wish
i
could
sell
everything
everything
she
exclaimed
passionately
lessways
street
as
well
then
i
should
be
absolutely
free
you
can
he
said
with
dramatic
emphasis
and
let
me
tell
you
that
ten
years
hence
those
lessways
street
houses
wo
be
worth
what
they
are
now
is
that
property
going
down
too
she
asked
i
thought
they
were
building
all
round
there
so
they
are
he
answered
but
cheap
cottages
your
houses
are
too
good
for
that
part
of
the
town
that
what
the
matter
with
them
people
who
can
afford
a
year
and
over
for
rent
wo
care
to
live
there
much
longer
you
know
the
end
house
is
empty
all
houses
seemed
to
her
to
be
a
singularly
insecure
and
even
perilous
form
of
property
and
the
sale
of
everything
she
possessed
presented
itself
to
her
fancy
as
a
transaction
which
would
enfranchise
her
from
the
past
it
symbolized
the
of
a
new
life
of
a
recommencement
unhampered
by
the
vestiges
of
grief
and
error
she
could
go
anywhere
do
what
she
chose
the
entire
world
would
lie
before
her
please
do
sell
it
all
for
me
she
pleaded
wistfully
supposing
you
could
about
how
much
should
i
have
i
mean
income
he
glanced
about
and
then
taking
a
pencil
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
scribbled
a
few
figures
on
his
cuff
quite
three
pounds
a
week
he
said
iv
after
a
perfunctory
discussion
which
was
somewhat
prolonged
by
both
of
them
in
order
to
avoid
an
appearance
of
hastiness
in
an
important
decision
george
cannon
opened
his
black
bag
and
then
looked
round
for
ink
the
little
room
having
no
table
had
no
inkpot
and
the
lawyer
took
from
his
pocket
an
eagle
indelible
pencil
the
of
those
simple
days
it
needed
some
adjustment
he
stepped
closer
to
the
window
and
held
the
pointed
end
of
the
case
up
to
the
light
while
screwing
the
lower
end
he
was
very
fastidious
in
these
mechanical
details
of
his
vocation
hilda
watched
him
from
behind
with
an
intentness
that
fascinated
herself
and
how
the
getting
on
she
asked
in
a
tone
of
friendly
curiosity
which
gave
an
exaggerated
impression
of
her
actual
feeling
she
was
more
and
more
ashamed
that
during
lunch
she
had
not
troubled
to
put
a
question
about
the
paper
she
was
even
ashamed
of
her
social
indifference
that
sarah
gailey
narrow
and
preoccupied
should
be
indifferent
should
never
once
in
three
months
have
referred
to
her
brother
organ
was
not
surprising
but
it
was
monstrous
that
she
hilda
the
secretary
the
priestess
should
share
this
uncivil
apathy
and
it
was
unjust
to
mark
the
newspaper
as
somehow
she
had
been
doing
with
the
stigma
of
her
mother
death
she
actually
began
to
characterize
her
recent
mental
attitude
to
her
past
life
as
morbid
oh
he
murmured
absently
with
gloomy
hesitation
as
he
manipulated
the
pencil
she
went
on
still
more
persuasively
i
suppose
you
got
a
new
secretary
no
he
said
as
though
it
fatigued
and
annoyed
him
to
dwell
on
the
subject
i
told
they
must
manage
without
it
no
fun
starting
a
new
paper
in
a
hole
like
the
five
towns
i
can
tell
you
plainly
his
high
exuberant
hopes
had
been
dashed
had
perhaps
been
destroyed
she
did
not
reply
she
could
not
she
became
suddenly
sad
with
sympathy
and
this
sadness
was
beautiful
to
her
already
when
he
was
scribbling
on
it
she
had
noticed
that
his
wristband
was
frayed
now
silhouetted
against
the
window
the
edge
of
the
wristband
caught
her
attention
again
and
grew
strangely
significant
this
man
was
passing
through
adversity
it
seemed
tragic
and
shocking
to
her
that
he
should
have
to
pass
through
adversity
that
he
could
not
remain
for
ever
triumphant
brilliant
cocksure
in
all
his
grand
schemes
and
masculinely
scathless
it
seemed
wrong
to
her
that
he
should
suffer
and
desirable
that
anybody
should
suffer
rather
than
he
george
cannon
with
faulty
linen
by
what
error
of
destiny
had
this
phenomenon
of
discord
been
caused
yes
was
it
due
to
weary
carelessness
or
to
actual
horrible
financial
straits
either
explanation
was
very
painful
to
her
she
had
a
vision
of
a
whole
sisterhood
of
women
toiling
amid
steam
and
soapsuds
in
secret
and
in
secret
denying
themselves
to
provide
him
with
all
that
he
lacked
so
that
he
might
always
emerge
into
the
world
unblemished
and
glitteringly
perfect
she
would
have
sacrificed
the
happiness
of
multitudes
to
her
sense
of
fitness
v
there
being
no
table
george
cannon
removed
a
grotesque
ornament
from
the
dwarf
bookcase
and
used
the
top
of
the
bookcase
as
a
hilda
was
called
upon
to
sign
two
papers
he
explained
exactly
what
these
papers
were
but
she
did
not
understand
nor
did
she
desire
to
understand
one
was
an
informal
and
the
other
was
an
authority
but
which
was
which
and
to
what
each
had
reference
she
superbly
and
wilfully
ignored
she
could
by
a
religious
effort
of
volition
make
of
herself
an
excellent
clerk
eagerly
imitative
and
mechanical
but
she
had
an
instinctive
antipathy
to
the
higher
forms
of
business
moreover
she
wanted
to
trust
herself
to
him
if
only
as
a
mystic
reparation
of
her
odious
rudeness
at
the
beginning
of
the
interview
and
she
thought
also
these
transactions
will
result
in
profit
to
him
it
is
by
such
transactions
that
he
lives
i
am
helping
him
in
his
adversity
when
he
gave
her
the
eagle
pencil
and
pointed
to
the
places
where
she
was
to
sign
she
took
the
pencil
with
fervour
more
and
more
anxious
to
atone
to
him
for
a
moment
she
stood
bewildered
in
a
dream
staring
at
the
scratched
mahogany
top
of
the
bookcase
and
the
bookcase
seemed
to
her
to
be
something
sentient
patient
and
helpful
that
had
always
been
waiting
there
in
the
corner
to
aid
george
cannon
in
this
crisis
something
human
like
herself
she
loved
the
bookcase
and
the
eagle
pencil
and
the
papers
and
the
pattern
on
the
wall
george
cannon
was
standing
behind
her
she
felt
his
presence
like
a
delicious
danger
she
signed
the
papers
in
that
large
scrawling
hand
which
for
a
few
brief
weeks
she
had
by
force
cramped
down
to
the
submissive
caligraphy
of
a
clerk
as
she
signed
she
saw
the
name
karkeek
in
the
midst
of
one
of
the
documents
and
remembered
with
joyous
nonchalance
that
george
cannon
own
name
never
appeared
in
george
cannon
affairs
he
took
her
place
in
front
of
the
little
bookcase
and
folded
the
documents
there
he
was
beside
her
in
all
his
masculinity
his
moustache
his
blue
chin
his
wide
white
hands
his
broadcloth
there
he
was
planted
on
his
massive
feet
as
on
a
pedestal
she
did
not
see
him
she
was
aware
of
him
and
she
was
aware
of
the
closed
door
behind
them
one
of
the
though
empty
continued
to
creak
like
a
thing
alive
faintly
very
faintly
she
could
hear
the
piano
boutwood
playing
overhead
were
the
footsteps
of
sarah
gailey
and
hettie
they
were
checking
the
linen
from
the
laundry
as
usual
on
saturday
afternoon
and
she
was
aware
of
herself
thin
throbbing
fragile
mournful
somehow
insignificant
he
looked
round
at
her
with
a
of
the
head
in
his
glance
was
good
humour
good
nature
protectiveness
and
rectitude
and
more
than
these
some
of
the
old
serenely
smiling
triumphant
quality
he
was
not
ruined
he
was
not
really
in
adversity
he
remained
the
conqueror
she
thrilled
with
her
relief
you
in
my
hands
now
no
mistake
he
murmured
roguishly
picking
up
the
documents
and
bending
over
the
bag
hilda
could
hear
a
heavy
footstep
on
the
stairs
ascending
in
the
same
instant
she
had
an
extraordinary
and
disconcerting
impulse
to
seize
his
hand
she
knew
not
why
whether
it
was
to
thank
him
to
express
her
sympathy
or
to
express
her
submission
she
struggled
against
this
impulse
but
the
impulse
was
part
of
herself
and
of
her
inmost
self
she
was
afraid
but
her
fear
was
pleasurable
she
was
ashamed
but
her
shame
was
pleasurable
she
wanted
to
move
away
from
where
she
stood
she
thought
if
only
i
willed
to
move
away
i
could
move
away
but
no
i
shall
not
will
it
i
like
remaining
just
here
in
this
fear
this
shame
and
this
agitation
she
had
a
clear
dazzling
perception
of
the
splendour
and
the
fineness
of
sin
but
she
did
not
know
what
sin
and
all
the
time
the
muscles
of
her
arm
were
tense
in
the
combat
between
the
weakening
desire
to
keep
her
arms
still
and
the
growing
desire
to
let
her
hand
seize
the
hand
of
george
cannon
and
all
the
time
the
heavy
footstep
was
ascending
the
interminable
staircase
and
all
the
time
george
cannon
with
averted
head
was
fumbling
in
the
bag
and
then
in
a
flash
she
was
really
afraid
the
fear
was
no
longer
pleasurable
and
her
shame
had
become
a
curse
she
said
to
herself
i
can
not
move
now
in
a
minute
i
shall
do
this
horrible
thing
nothing
can
save
me
despairing
she
found
a
dark
and
tumultuous
joy
in
despair
the
trance
endured
for
ages
while
disaster
approached
nearer
and
nearer
then
after
the
heavy
footstep
had
been
climbing
the
staircase
since
earth
began
the
door
was
brusquely
opened
and
the
jovial
fat
face
of
boutwood
appeared
letting
in
the
louder
sound
of
the
piano
oh
i
beg
pardon
he
muttered
pretending
that
he
had
assumed
the
little
room
to
be
empty
the
fact
was
that
he
was
in
search
of
george
cannon
in
whom
he
had
recognized
a
fraternal
spirit
come
in
boutwood
said
hilda
with
an
easy
disdainful
calm
which
absolutely
astounded
herself
that
all
then
she
added
to
george
cannon
glancing
at
him
indifferently
she
departed
without
waiting
for
an
answer
vi
putting
on
a
bonnet
and
taking
an
umbrella
to
occupy
her
hands
she
went
out
into
the
remedial
freedom
of
the
streets
and
after
turning
the
first
corner
she
saw
coming
towards
her
the
figure
of
a
woman
whom
she
seemed
to
know
elegant
even
stately
in
youthful
grace
it
was
janet
orgreave
wearing
a
fashionable
summer
costume
as
they
recognized
each
other
the
girls
blushed
slightly
janet
hastened
forward
hilda
stood
still
she
was
amazed
at
the
chance
which
had
sent
her
two
unexpected
visitors
in
the
same
day
they
shook
hands
and
kissed
so
i
found
you
said
janet
how
are
you
you
poor
dear
why
you
answer
my
letter
letter
hilda
repeated
wondering
then
she
remembered
that
she
had
indeed
received
a
letter
from
janet
but
in
her
comatose
dejection
had
neglected
to
answer
it
i
up
in
london
with
father
for
the
weekend
we
want
you
to
come
with
us
to
the
abbey
and
you
must
come
back
with
us
to
bursley
on
monday
you
we
quite
set
on
it
i
left
father
all
alone
this
afternoon
to
come
up
here
and
find
you
out
not
that
he
minds
what
a
way
it
is
but
how
are
you
hilda
hilda
was
so
touched
by
janet
affectionate
solicitude
that
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
looked
at
that
radiating
and
innocent
goodness
and
thought
how
different
i
am
from
her
she
has
the
least
idea
how
different
i
am
for
a
moment
janet
seemed
to
her
to
be
a
sort
of
angel
modish
but
exquisitely
genuine
she
saw
in
the
invitation
to
the
five
towns
a
miraculous
defence
against
a
peril
the
prospect
of
which
was
already
alarming
her
she
would
be
compelled
to
go
to
turnhill
in
order
to
visit
lessways
street
and
decide
what
of
her
mother
goods
she
must
keep
she
would
of
course
take
janet
with
her
in
all
the
turnhill
affairs
janet
should
accompany
her
her
new
life
should
begin
under
the
protection
of
janet
society
and
her
heart
turned
from
the
old
life
towards
the
new
with
hope
and
a
vague
brightening
expectation
of
happiness
at
the
cedars
she
led
janet
to
her
bedroom
and
then
came
out
of
the
bedroom
to
bid
to
george
cannon
the
extreme
complexity
of
existence
and
of
her
sensations
baffled
and
intimidated

chapter
iii
journey
to
bleakridge
i
hilda
and
janet
were
mounting
the
precipitous
sytch
bank
together
on
their
way
from
turnhill
into
bursley
it
was
dark
they
had
missed
one
train
at
turnhill
and
had
preferred
not
to
wait
for
the
next
although
they
had
been
very
busy
in
hilda
house
throughout
all
the
afternoon
and
a
part
of
the
evening
and
had
eaten
only
a
picnic
meal
neither
of
them
was
aware
of
fatigue
and
the
two
miles
to
bursley
seemed
a
trifle
going
slowly
up
the
steep
slope
they
did
not
converse
janet
said
that
the
weather
was
changing
and
hilda
without
replying
peered
at
the
black
baffling
sky
the
air
had
almost
suddenly
grown
warmer
above
in
the
regions
unseen
mysterious
activities
were
in
movement
as
if
marshalling
vast
forces
the
stars
had
vanished
a
gentle
but
equivocal
wind
on
the
cheek
presaged
rain
and
seemed
to
be
bearing
downwards
into
the
homeliness
of
the
earth
some
strange
vibration
out
of
infinite
space
the
primeval
elements
of
the
summer
night
encouraged
and
intensified
hilda
mood
half
joyous
half
apprehensive
she
thought
a
few
days
ago
i
was
in
hornsey
with
the
prospect
of
the
visit
to
turnhill
before
me
now
the
visit
is
behind
me
i
said
that
janet
should
be
my
companion
and
she
has
been
my
companion
i
said
that
i
would
cut
myself
free
and
i
have
cut
myself
free
i
need
never
go
to
turnhill
again
unless
i
like
the
two
trunks
will
be
sent
for
and
all
the
rest
will
be
sold
even
the
clock
the
thing
is
done
i
have
absolute
liberty
and
an
income
and
the
intimacy
of
this
splendid
affectionate
janet
how
fortunate
it
was
that
cannon
was
not
at
his
office
when
we
called
of
course
i
was
obliged
to
call
and
yet
would
it
not
be
more
satisfactory
if
i
had
seen
him
i
must
have
been
in
a
horribly
morbid
state
up
at
hornsey
soon
i
must
decide
about
my
future
soon
i
shall
actually
have
decided
life
is
very
queer
she
had
as
yet
no
notion
whatever
of
what
she
would
do
with
her
liberty
and
her
income
and
the
future
but
she
thought
vaguely
of
something
heroic
grandiose
and
unusual
ii
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
small
shabby
book
bound
in
blue
and
gold
with
gilt
edges
a
little
irregular
she
had
found
this
book
while
sorting
out
the
multitudinous
contents
of
her
mother
wardrobe
and
at
the
last
moment
perceiving
that
it
had
been
overlooked
and
being
somehow
ashamed
to
leave
it
to
the
auctioneers
she
had
brought
it
away
not
knowing
how
she
would
ultimately
dispose
of
it
the
book
had
possibly
been
dear
to
her
mother
but
she
could
not
embarrass
her
freedom
by
conserving
everything
that
had
possibly
been
dear
to
her
mother
it
was
entitled
girl
by
copley
and
it
had
been
published
by
the
religious
tract
society
no
doubt
in
her
mother
girlhood
the
frontispiece
a
steel
engraving
showed
a
group
of
girls
feeding
some
swans
by
the
terraced
margin
of
an
ornamental
water
and
it
bore
the
legend
feeding
the
swans
and
on
the
page
was
the
text
that
our
daughters
may
be
as
polished
after
the
similitude
of
a
palace
psalm
cxliv
in
the
table
of
contents
were
such
phrases
as
one
thing
at
a
time
darkness
and
light
respect
for
ministers
the
drowning
fly
trifling
with
words
of
scripture
goose
and
swan
delicate
health
conscientious
regard
to
truth
sensibility
and
gentleness
contrasted
with
affectation
curiosity
and
tattling
instability
of
worldly
possessions
a
book
representing
for
hilda
all
that
was
most
grotesque
in
an
age
that
was
now
definitely
finished
and
closed
a
silly
book
during
the
picnic
meal
she
had
idly
read
extracts
from
it
to
janet
amusing
sentences
and
though
the
book
had
once
been
held
sacred
by
her
who
was
dead
and
though
they
were
engaged
in
stirring
the
ashes
of
a
tragedy
the
girls
had
nevertheless
permitted
themselves
a
kindly
moderate
mirth
hilda
had
quoted
from
a
conversation
in
it
well
i
would
rather
sit
quietly
round
this
cheerful
fire
and
talk
with
dear
mamma
than
go
to
the
grandest
ball
that
ever
was
known
and
janet
had
plumply
commented
what
a
dreadful
lie
and
then
they
had
both
laughed
openly
perhaps
to
relieve
the
spiritual
tension
caused
by
the
day
task
and
the
surroundings
after
that
hilda
had
continued
to
dip
into
the
book
but
silently
and
janet
had
imagined
that
hilda
was
merely
bored
by
the
monotonous
absurdity
of
the
sentiments
expressed
janet
was
wrong
hilda
had
read
the
following
one
word
more
do
not
rest
in
your
religious
impressions
you
have
perhaps
been
the
subject
of
terror
on
account
of
sin
your
mind
has
been
solemnized
by
some
event
in
providence
by
an
alarming
fit
of
sickness
or
the
death
of
a
relative
or
a
companion
this
is
indeed
to
be
reckoned
a
great
mercy
but
then
the
danger
is
lest
you
should
rest
here
lest
those
tears
and
terrors
and
resolutions
should
be
the
only
evidences
on
which
you
venture
to
conclude
on
the
safety
of
your
immortal
state
what
is
your
present
condition
which
words
intimidated
hilda
in
spite
of
herself
in
vain
she
repeated
that
the
book
was
a
silly
book
she
really
believed
that
it
was
silly
but
she
knew
also
that
there
was
an
aspect
of
it
which
was
not
silly
she
was
reminded
by
it
that
she
had
found
no
solution
of
the
problem
which
had
distracted
her
in
hornsey
is
your
present
condition
her
present
condition
was
still
that
of
a
weakling
and
a
coward
who
had
sunk
down
inertly
before
the
great
problem
of
sin
and
now
in
the
growing
strength
of
her
moral
convalescence
she
was
raising
her
eyes
again
to
meet
the
problem
her
future
seemed
to
be
bound
up
with
the
problem
as
she
breasted
the
top
of
the
sytch
under
the
invisible
lowering
clouds
with
her
new
adored
friend
by
her
side
and
the
despised
but
powerful
book
in
her
hand
she
mused
in
an
ambiguous
reverie
upon
her
situation
dogged
by
the
problem
which
alone
was
accompanying
her
out
of
the
past
into
the
future
her
reverie
was
shot
through
by
piercing
needles
of
regret
for
her
mother
and
even
with
the
touch
of
janet
arm
against
her
own
in
the
darkness
she
had
sharp
realizations
of
her
extreme
solitude
in
the
world
withal
the
sense
of
life
was
precious
and
beautiful
she
was
not
happy
but
she
was
filled
with
the
mysterious
vital
elation
which
surpasses
happiness
iii
they
descended
gently
into
bursley
crossing
the
top
of
square
and
turning
eastwards
into
market
square
ruled
by
the
sombre
and
massive
town
hall
in
whose
high
tower
an
illuminated
dial
shone
like
a
topaz
to
hilda
this
nocturnal
entry
into
bursley
had
the
romance
of
an
entry
into
a
town
friendly
but
strange
and
recondite
during
the
few
days
of
her
stay
with
the
orgreaves
in
the
suburb
of
bleakridge
she
had
scarcely
gone
into
the
town
once
she
had
never
seen
it
at
night
in
the
old
turnhill
days
she
had
come
over
to
bursley
occasionally
with
her
mother
but
to
shoppers
from
turnhill
bursley
meant
luke
square
and
not
a
yard
beyond
now
the
girls
arrived
at
the
commencement
of
the
track
where
a
huge
engine
and
tram
were
waiting
and
as
they
turned
another
corner
the
long
perspective
of
trafalgar
road
rising
with
its
double
row
of
lamps
towards
fashionable
bleakridge
was
revealed
to
hilda
she
thought
naturally
that
every
other
part
of
the
five
towns
was
more
impressive
and
more
important
than
the
poor
little
outskirt
turnhill
of
her
birth
in
turnhill
there
was
no
thoroughfare
to
compare
with
trafalgar
road
and
no
fashionable
suburb
whatever
she
had
almost
the
feeling
of
being
in
a
metropolis
if
a
local
metropolis
it
beginning
to
rain
i
think
said
janet
who
that
hilda
questioned
abruptly
ignoring
the
remark
in
the
swift
unreflecting
excitement
of
a
sensibility
surprised
where
there
they
were
going
down
duck
bank
into
the
hollow
on
the
right
opposite
the
lighted
dragon
hotel
lay
duck
square
in
obscure
somnolence
at
the
corner
of
duck
square
and
trafalgar
road
was
a
shop
of
which
all
the
shutters
were
up
except
two
or
three
in
the
centre
of
the
doorway
framed
thus
in
the
aperture
a
young
man
stood
within
the
shop
under
a
bright
central
he
was
gazing
intently
at
a
large
sheet
of
paper
which
he
held
in
his
outstretched
hands
and
the
girls
saw
him
in
profile
tall
rather
lanky
fair
with
hair
dishevelled
and
a
serious
studious
and
magnanimous
face
quite
unconscious
that
he
made
a
picture
for
unseen
observers
that
said
janet
in
a
confidential
and
interested
tone
that
young
clayhanger
edwin
clayhanger
his
father
the
printer
you
know
came
from
turnhill
originally
i
never
knew
said
hilda
but
i
seem
to
have
heard
the
name
oh
it
must
have
been
a
long
time
ago
he
got
the
best
business
in
bursley
now
father
says
it
one
of
the
best
in
the
five
towns
built
that
new
house
just
close
to
ours
do
you
remember
i
pointed
it
out
to
you
father
the
architect
they
going
to
move
into
it
next
week
or
the
week
after
i
expect
that
why
the
son
and
heir
working
so
late
packing
and
so
on
perhaps
the
young
man
moved
out
of
sight
but
his
face
had
made
in
those
few
thrilling
seconds
a
deep
impression
on
hilda
so
that
in
her
mind
she
still
saw
it
with
an
almost
physical
particularity
of
detail
it
presented
itself
to
her
in
some
mysterious
way
as
a
romantic
visage
wistful
full
of
sad
subtleties
of
the
unknown
and
the
seductive
and
of
a
latent
benevolence
it
was
as
recondite
and
as
sympathetic
as
the
town
in
which
she
had
discovered
it
she
said
nothing
old
clayhanger
is
a
regular
character
janet
eagerly
went
on
to
hilda
great
content
some
people
do
like
him
but
i
rather
do
like
him
she
was
always
thus
kind
grandmother
once
told
me
he
sprang
from
simply
nothing
at
all
worked
on
a
potbank
when
he
was
quite
a
child
who
the
father
you
mean
yes
the
father
now
goodness
knows
how
much
he
is
worth
i
father
is
always
saying
he
could
buy
up
lock
stock
and
barrel
janet
laughed
people
often
call
him
a
miser
but
he
ca
be
so
much
of
a
miser
seeing
that
he
built
this
new
house
and
i
suppose
the
son
in
the
business
yes
he
wanted
to
be
an
architect
that
was
how
father
got
to
know
him
but
old
clayhanger
would
have
it
and
so
he
a
printer
and
one
day
he
be
one
of
the
principal
men
in
the
town
oh
so
you
know
him
well
we
do
and
we
do
i
go
into
the
shop
sometimes
and
then
seen
him
once
or
twice
up
at
the
new
house
we
asked
him
to
come
in
and
see
us
but
he
never
come
and
i
do
think
he
ever
will
i
believe
his
father
does
keep
him
grinding
away
rather
hard
i
sure
he
frightfully
clever
how
can
you
tell
oh
from
bits
of
things
he
says
and
he
read
everything
it
seems
and
once
he
saved
a
great
heavy
from
going
through
the
floor
of
the
into
the
basement
if
it
had
been
for
him
there
have
been
a
dreadful
accident
everybody
was
talking
about
that
he
does
look
it
does
he
they
were
now
passing
the
corner
at
which
stood
the
shop
hilda
peered
within
the
narrowing
unshuttered
slit
but
she
could
see
no
more
of
edwin
clayhanger
no
he
does
she
agreed
while
thinking
nevertheless
that
he
did
look
precisely
that
and
so
he
lives
all
alone
with
his
father
no
mother
no
mother
but
there
are
two
sisters
the
youngest
is
married
and
just
going
to
have
a
baby
poor
thing
the
other
one
keeps
house
i
believe
she
a
splendid
girl
but
neither
of
them
is
a
bit
like
edwin
not
a
bit
he
what
i
do
know
look
here
miss
what
about
this
rain
i
vote
we
take
the
car
up
the
hill
iv
the
was
rumbling
after
them
down
duck
bank
it
stopped
huge
above
them
and
they
climbed
into
it
through
an
odour
of
warm
grease
that
trailed
from
the
engine
the
conductor
touched
his
hat
to
janet
who
smiled
like
a
sister
upon
this
two
men
were
the
only
other
occupants
of
the
interior
of
the
car
both
raised
their
hats
to
janet
the
girls
sat
down
in
opposite
corners
next
to
the
door
then
with
a
deafening
continuous
clatter
of
loose
and
throbbing
of
its
filthy
floor
the
vehicle
started
again
elephantine
it
was
impossible
to
talk
in
that
unique
din
hilda
had
no
desire
to
talk
she
watched
janet
pay
the
fares
as
in
a
dream
without
even
offering
her
own
penny
though
as
a
rule
she
was
touchily
punctilious
in
sharing
expenses
with
the
sumptuous
janet
without
being
in
the
least
aware
of
it
and
quite
innocently
janet
had
painted
a
picture
of
the
young
man
edwin
clayhanger
which
intensified
a
hundredfold
the
strong
romantic
piquancy
of
hilda
brief
vision
of
him
in
an
instant
hilda
saw
her
ideal
future
that
future
which
had
loomed
grandiose
indefinite
and
strange
she
saw
it
quite
precise
and
simple
as
the
wife
of
such
a
creature
as
edwin
clayhanger
the
change
was
astounding
in
its
abruptness
she
saw
all
the
delightful
and
pure
vistas
of
love
with
a
man
subtle
baffling
and
benevolent
and
above
all
superior
with
a
man
who
would
be
respected
by
a
whole
town
as
a
pillar
of
society
while
bringing
to
his
intimacy
with
herself
an
exotic
and
wistful
quality
which
neither
she
nor
anyone
could
possibly
define
she
asked
what
attracts
me
in
him
i
do
know
like
she
who
had
never
spoken
to
him
she
who
never
before
had
vividly
seen
herself
as
married
to
a
man
he
was
clever
he
was
sincere
he
was
kind
he
was
trustworthy
he
would
have
wealth
and
importance
and
reputation
all
this
was
good
but
all
this
would
have
been
indifferent
to
her
had
there
not
been
an
enigmatic
and
inscrutable
and
unprecedented
something
in
his
face
in
his
bearing
which
challenged
and
inflamed
her
imagination
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
think
of
janet
as
in
the
future
a
married
woman
but
of
herself
she
thought
with
new
agitations
i
am
innocent
now
i
am
ignorant
now
i
am
a
girl
now
but
one
day
i
shall
be
so
no
longer
one
day
i
shall
be
a
woman
one
day
i
shall
be
in
the
power
and
possession
of
some
man
if
not
this
man
then
some
other
everything
happens
and
this
will
happen
and
the
hazardous
strangeness
of
life
enchanted
her
chapter
iv
with
the
orgreaves
i
the
orgreave
family
was
holding
its
nightly
session
in
the
large
of
lane
end
house
when
hilda
and
janet
arrived
the
stood
generously
open
in
three
different
places
and
the
heavy
outer
curtains
as
well
as
the
lace
inner
ones
were
moving
gently
in
the
capricious
breeze
that
came
across
the
oval
lawn
the
multitudinous
sound
of
rain
on
leaves
entered
also
with
the
wind
and
a
could
be
heard
thundering
down
trafalgar
road
from
which
the
house
was
separated
by
only
a
few
intervening
minor
roofs
orgreave
the
plump
faded
image
of
goodness
with
janet
full
red
lips
and
janet
kindly
eyes
sat
as
usual
whether
in
winter
or
in
summer
near
the
fireplace
surveying
with
placidity
the
theatre
where
the
innumerable
dramas
of
her
motherhood
had
been
enacted
tom
her
eldest
the
thin
spectacled
lawyer
had
as
a
boy
of
seven
rampaged
on
that
identical
turkey
hearthrug
when
it
was
new
a
quarter
of
a
century
earlier
he
was
now
seated
at
the
grand
piano
with
the
youngest
child
alicia
a
gawky
little
treasure
always
alternating
between
pertness
and
timidity
aged
twelve
jimmie
and
johnnie
young
bloods
of
nineteen
and
eighteen
were
only
present
in
their
mother
heart
being
in
process
of
establishing
by
practice
the
right
to
go
forth
into
the
world
of
an
evening
and
return
when
they
chose
without
suffering
too
much
from
family
curiosity
two
other
children
marian
eldest
daughter
and
sole
furnisher
of
grandchildren
to
the
family
and
charlie
a
young
doctor
were
permanently
away
in
london
osmond
orgreave
the
elegant
and
faintly
mocking
father
of
the
brood
a
handsome
grizzled
man
of
between
fifty
and
sixty
was
walking
to
and
fro
between
the
grand
piano
and
the
small
upright
piano
in
the
farther
half
of
the
room
well
my
dear
said
orgreave
to
hilda
you
are
wet
she
drew
hilda
towards
her
and
stroked
her
shoulder
and
then
kissed
her
the
embrace
was
to
convey
the
mother
sympathy
with
hilda
in
the
ordeal
of
the
visit
to
turnhill
and
her
satisfaction
that
the
ordeal
was
now
over
the
ageing
lady
seemed
to
kiss
her
on
behalf
of
the
entire
friendly
family
all
the
others
appreciating
the
delicacy
of
the
situation
refrained
from
the
peril
of
clumsy
speech
oh
no
mother
janet
exclaimed
reassuringly
we
came
up
by
car
and
i
had
my
umbrella
and
it
only
began
to
rain
in
earnest
just
as
we
got
to
the
gate
very
thoughtful
of
it
i
sure
piped
the
alicia
from
the
piano
she
could
talk
in
her
pert
moments
exactly
like
her
brothers
alicia
darling
said
janet
coaxingly
as
she
sat
on
the
sofa
flanked
by
the
hat
gloves
and
jacket
which
she
had
just
taken
off
will
you
run
upstairs
with
these
things
and
take
hilda
too
i
quite
exhausted
father
will
swoon
if
i
leave
them
here
i
suppose
walking
about
because
he
so
proud
of
his
new
birthday
slippers
but
i
just
playing
the
symphony
with
tom
alicia
protested
i
run
up
i
was
just
going
to
said
hilda
you
do
no
such
thing
orgreave
announced
sharply
alicia
i
surprised
at
you
here
janet
and
hilda
have
been
out
since
noon
and
you
and
so
on
and
so
on
said
alicia
jumping
up
from
the
piano
in
obedience
we
did
wait
supper
orgreave
went
on
but
i
told
martha
to
leave
mother
dearest
janet
stopped
her
please
do
mention
food
stuffed
ourselves
have
we
hilda
anyone
been
swetnam
said
alicia
as
she
left
the
room
with
her
arms
full
swetnam
corrected
orgreave
which
one
the
ineffable
the
ineffable
replied
orgreave
who
had
wandered
smiling
enigmatically
to
the
sofa
his
legs
like
the
whole
of
his
person
had
a
distinguished
air
and
he
held
up
first
one
slippered
foot
and
then
the
other
to
the
silent
inspection
of
the
girls
he
may
look
in
again
later
on
it
evidently
hilda
he
wants
to
see
this
said
orgreave
lazily
sank
into
an
easy
chair
opposite
the
sofa
and
lighted
a
cigarette
he
was
one
of
the
most
industrious
men
in
the
five
towns
and
assuredly
the
most
industrious
architect
but
into
an
idle
hour
he
could
pack
more
indolence
than
even
johnnie
and
jimmie
alleged
wastrels
could
accomplish
in
a
week
i
say
janet
tom
sang
out
from
the
piano
you
are
really
exhausted
are
you
i
getting
better
well
let
dash
through
the
scherzo
before
the
infant
comes
back
she
ca
take
it
half
fast
enough
and
do
you
think
i
can
said
janet
rising
in
theory
janet
was
not
a
pianist
and
she
never
played
solos
nor
accompanied
songs
but
in
the
actual
practice
of
her
sympathetic
presence
of
mind
at
difficult
crises
of
the
music
caused
her
to
be
esteemed
by
tom
the
expert
and
enthusiast
as
superior
to
all
other
performers
in
the
family
ii
hilda
listened
with
pleasure
and
with
exaltation
to
the
scherzo
beyond
a
little
at
school
she
had
no
practical
acquaintance
with
music
there
had
never
been
a
piano
at
home
but
she
knew
that
this
music
was
beethoven
and
from
the
mere
intonation
of
that
name
as
it
was
uttered
in
her
presence
in
the
house
of
the
orgreaves
she
was
aware
of
its
greatness
and
the
religious
faculty
in
her
had
enabled
her
at
once
to
accept
its
supremacy
as
an
article
of
genuine
belief
so
that
though
she
understood
it
not
she
felt
it
and
was
uplifted
by
it
whenever
she
heard
beethoven
and
she
heard
it
often
because
tom
in
the
words
of
the
family
had
for
the
moment
got
beethoven
on
the
brain
her
thoughts
and
her
aspirations
were
ennobled
she
was
singularly
content
with
this
existence
amid
the
intimacy
of
the
orgreaves
the
largeness
and
prodigality
and
culture
of
the
family
life
so
different
from
anything
she
had
ever
known
and
in
particular
so
different
from
the
desolating
atmosphere
of
the
cedars
soothed
and
flattered
her
in
a
manner
subtly
agreeable
at
the
same
time
she
was
but
little
irked
by
it
for
the
reason
that
her
spirit
was
not
one
to
be
unduly
affected
by
exterior
social
intellectual
and
physical
conditions
moreover
the
orgreaves
though
obviously
of
a
class
superior
to
her
own
had
the
facile
and
yet
aristocratic
unceremoniousness
which
unconsciously
repudiates
such
distinctions
until
circumstances
arise
that
compel
their
acknowledgment
to
live
among
the
orgreaves
was
like
living
in
a
small
private
republic
that
throbbed
with
a
hundred
activities
and
interests
each
member
of
it
was
a
centre
of
various
energy
and
from
each
hilda
drew
something
that
was
precious
from
orgreave
sheer
love
and
calm
wisdom
from
janet
sheer
love
and
the
spectacle
of
elegance
from
little
alicia
candour
and
admiration
from
tom
knowledge
artistic
enthusiasm
and
shy
curt
sympathy
from
johnnie
and
jimmie
the
homage
of
their
proud
and
naïve
mannishness
as
for
orgreave
she
admired
him
perhaps
as
much
as
she
admired
even
janet
and
once
when
he
and
she
had
taken
a
walk
together
up
to
toft
end
she
had
thought
him
quite
exquisite
in
his
attitude
to
her
quizzical
worldly
and
yet
sensitively
understanding
and
humane
and
withal
they
never
worried
her
by
interferences
and
criticisms
they
never
presumed
on
their
hospitality
but
left
her
as
free
as
though
her
age
had
been
twice
what
it
was
undoubtedly
in
the
ardour
of
her
gratitude
she
idealized
every
one
of
them
the
sole
reproach
which
in
secret
she
would
formulate
against
them
had
reference
to
their
cynical
levity
in
conversation
they
would
never
treat
a
serious
topic
seriously
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
either
one
or
another
would
yield
to
the
temptation
of
clever
facetiousness
and
clever
facetiousness
would
always
carry
off
the
honours
in
a
discussion
this
did
not
apply
to
orgreave
who
was
incapable
of
humour
but
it
applied
a
little
even
to
janet
the
thought
continually
arising
in
hilda
mind
was
why
do
they
care
for
me
what
can
they
see
in
me
why
are
they
so
good
to
me
i
was
never
good
to
them
she
did
not
guess
that
at
her
very
first
visit
to
lane
end
house
the
force
and
mystery
of
her
character
had
powerfully
attracted
these
rather
experienced
amateurs
of
human
nature
she
was
unaware
that
she
had
made
her
mark
upon
janet
and
charlie
so
far
back
as
the
days
of
the
and
she
the
appeal
of
her
situation
as
an
orphan
and
a
solitary
whose
mother
death
in
its
swiftness
had
amounted
to
a
tragedy
the
scherzo
was
finished
and
alicia
had
not
returned
into
the
the
two
pianists
sat
hesitant
where
is
that
infant
tom
demanded
if
i
finish
it
all
without
her
she
be
vexed
i
can
tell
you
where
she
ought
to
be
said
orgreave
placidly
she
ought
to
be
in
bed
no
wonder
she
looks
pale
stopping
up
till
this
time
of
night
then
there
were
unusual
and
startling
movements
behind
the
door
accompanied
by
giggling
and
alicia
entered
followed
by
charlie
charlie
who
was
supposed
at
that
precise
instant
to
be
in
london
hello
mater
said
the
charlie
with
a
sublime
affectation
of
calmness
as
though
he
had
slipped
out
of
the
next
room
he
produced
an
effect
fully
equal
to
his
desires
iii
in
a
little
while
charlie
on
the
sofa
was
seated
at
a
small
table
covered
with
viands
and
fruit
the
white
cloth
spread
on
the
table
made
a
curiously
charming
patch
amid
the
sombre
colours
of
the
he
had
protested
that
having
consumed
much
food
en
route
he
was
not
hungry
but
in
vain
orgreave
demolished
such
arguments
by
the
power
of
her
notorious
theory
which
admitted
no
exceptions
that
any
person
coming
off
an
express
train
must
be
in
need
of
sustenance
the
odd
thing
was
that
all
the
others
discovered
mysterious
appetites
and
began
to
eat
and
drink
with
gusto
sitting
standing
or
walking
about
while
charlie
munching
related
how
he
had
miraculously
got
three
leave
from
the
hospital
and
how
he
had
impulsively
it
to
euston
and
how
having
arrived
at
knype
he
had
also
it
from
knype
to
bleakridge
instead
of
waiting
for
the
loop
line
train
the
blot
on
his
advent
in
the
eyes
of
orgreave
was
that
he
had
no
fresh
news
of
marian
and
her
children
you
do
seem
very
surprised
to
find
hilda
here
said
alicia
it
not
my
business
to
be
surprised
at
anything
kid
charlie
retorted
smiling
at
hilda
who
sat
beside
him
on
the
sofa
moreover
do
i
get
ten
columns
of
news
every
three
days
i
know
far
more
about
this
town
than
you
do
i
bet
everybody
laughed
at
orgreave
the
great
and
universal
disseminator
of
information
now
alicia
you
must
go
to
bed
said
orgreave
and
alicia
regretted
that
she
had
been
so
indiscreet
as
to
draw
attention
to
herself
the
kid
can
stay
up
if
she
will
say
her
piece
said
charlie
mockingly
he
knew
that
he
could
play
the
autocrat
for
that
evening
at
any
rate
what
piece
the
child
demanded
blushing
and
defiant
her
ben
adhem
said
charlie
do
you
think
i
do
know
all
about
that
too
oh
mother
you
are
a
bore
alicia
exclaimed
pouting
why
did
you
tell
him
that
well
i
say
it
if
hilda
will
recite
something
as
well
me
murmured
hilda
staggered
i
never
recite
i
always
understood
you
recite
beautifully
said
orgreave
you
know
you
do
hilda
said
janet
of
course
you
do
said
charlie
never
heard
me
anyhow
she
replied
to
him
obstinately
how
could
they
have
got
it
fixed
into
their
heads
that
she
was
a
reciter
this
renown
was
most
disconcerting
now
hilda
orgreave
soothingly
admonished
her
from
the
back
of
the
sofa
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
up
at
him
smiling
in
her
distress
go
ahead
then
kid
it
agreed
said
charlie
and
alicia
galloped
through
leigh
hunt
moral
poem
which
she
was
preparing
for
an
imminent
in
an
extraordinarily
short
space
of
time
but
i
ca
remember
anything
i
have
recited
for
years
and
years
hilda
pleaded
when
the
child
burst
out
now
hilda
charlie
pronounced
some
tennyson
orgreave
suggested
do
you
know
any
tennyson
we
must
have
something
now
and
alicia
exulting
in
the
fact
that
she
had
paid
the
penalty
imposed
cried
that
there
could
be
no
drawing
back
hilda
was
lost
orgreave
tone
with
all
its
softness
was
a
command
tennyson
i
forgotten
she
muttered
i
prompt
you
said
charlie
thomas
everybody
looked
at
tom
expert
in
literature
as
well
as
in
music
tom
the
collector
the
owner
of
books
and
bookcases
tom
went
to
a
bookcase
and
drew
forth
a
green
volume
familiar
and
sacred
throughout
all
england
oh
dear
hilda
moaned
where
do
you
mean
to
begin
charlie
sternly
inquired
it
just
happens
that
i
reading
memoriam
myself
i
read
ten
stanzas
a
day
hilda
bent
over
the
book
with
him
but
i
must
stand
up
she
said
with
sudden
fire
i
ca
recite
sitting
down
they
all
cried
bravo
and
made
a
circle
for
her
and
she
stood
up
the
utterance
of
the
first
lines
was
a
martyrdom
for
her
but
after
that
she
surrendered
herself
frankly
to
the
mood
of
the
poem
and
forgot
to
suffer
shame
speaking
in
a
loud
clear
dramatic
voice
which
she
accompanied
by
glances
and
even
by
gestures
after
about
thirty
lines
she
stopped
and
regaining
her
ordinary
senses
perceived
that
the
entire
family
was
staring
at
her
with
an
extreme
intentness
i
ca
do
any
more
she
murmured
weakly
and
dropped
on
to
the
sofa
everybody
clapped
very
heartily
it
wonderful
said
janet
in
a
low
tone
i
should
just
say
it
was
said
tom
seriously
and
hilda
was
saturated
with
delicious
joy
you
ought
to
go
on
the
stage
that
what
you
ought
to
do
said
charlie
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
hilda
dreamt
of
the
stage
and
then
orgreave
said
softly
like
a
mother
i
quite
sure
hilda
would
never
dream
of
any
such
thing
iv
there
was
an
irruption
of
jimmie
and
johnnie
and
three
of
the
swetnam
brothers
including
him
known
as
the
ineffable
jimmie
and
johnnie
played
the
rôle
of
the
absolutely
imperturbable
with
a
skill
equal
to
charlie
own
and
only
a
series
of
calm
marked
the
greetings
of
these
relatives
the
swetnams
were
more
rollickingly
demonstrative
now
that
the
was
quite
thickly
populated
hilda
made
nervous
by
orgreave
jocular
insinuation
that
she
herself
was
the
object
of
the
swetnams
call
took
refuge
first
with
janet
and
then
as
janet
was
drawn
into
the
general
crowd
with
charlie
who
was
absently
turning
over
the
pages
of
in
memoriam
know
this
he
inquired
friendly
indicating
the
poem
i
do
she
said
it
splendid
is
it
well
he
answered
it
rather
on
the
religious
tack
you
know
that
why
i
reading
it
he
smiled
oddly
really
he
hesitated
and
then
nodded
it
was
the
strangest
avowal
from
this
young
dandy
of
with
the
airy
and
cynical
tongue
hilda
thought
here
then
is
another
and
her
own
most
secret
troubles
recurred
to
her
mind
what
that
about
teddy
clayhanger
charlie
cried
out
suddenly
looking
up
he
had
caught
the
name
in
a
distant
conversation
janet
explained
how
they
had
seen
edwin
and
went
on
to
say
that
it
was
impossible
to
persuade
him
to
call
what
rot
said
charlie
i
bet
you
what
you
like
i
get
him
here
night
he
added
to
hilda
went
to
school
with
him
face
burned
i
bet
you
do
said
janet
stoutly
from
across
the
room
i
bet
you
a
shilling
i
do
said
charlie
have
a
penny
left
janet
smiled
father
will
you
lend
me
a
shilling
that
what
i
here
for
said
orgreave
orgreave
the
youngest
swetnam
put
in
you
talk
exactly
like
the
dad
talks
the
bet
was
made
and
according
to
a
singular
but
family
custom
tom
had
to
be
hilda
became
troubled
and
apprehensive
she
hoped
that
charlie
would
lose
and
then
she
hoped
that
he
would
win
looking
forward
to
the
intimate
bedroom
chat
with
janet
which
brought
each
evening
to
a
heavenly
close
she
said
to
herself
if
he
come
i
shall
make
janet
promise
that
i
not
to
be
asked
to
recite
or
anything
in
fact
i
shall
get
her
to
see
that
i
not
discussed
chapter
v
edwin
clayhanger
i
the
next
evening
and
orgreave
hilda
janet
and
alicia
were
in
the
of
the
orgreaves
awaiting
the
advent
at
the
table
of
sundry
young
men
whose
voices
could
be
heard
through
open
doors
in
the
distance
of
the
charlie
orgreave
had
won
his
bet
and
edwin
clayhanger
was
among
those
young
men
who
had
remained
behind
in
the
to
exchange
according
to
the
practice
of
young
men
ideas
upon
life
and
the
world
hilda
had
been
introduced
to
him
but
owing
to
the
performance
of
another
beethoven
symphony
there
had
been
almost
no
conversation
before
supper
and
she
had
not
heard
him
talk
she
had
stationed
herself
behind
the
grand
piano
on
the
plea
of
turning
over
the
pages
for
the
musicians
though
it
was
only
with
great
uncertainty
and
in
peril
of
missing
the
exact
instant
for
turning
that
she
followed
the
music
on
the
page
and
from
this
security
she
had
furtively
glanced
at
edwin
when
her
task
allowed
perhaps
i
was
quite
mistaken
last
night
she
said
to
herself
perhaps
he
is
perfectly
ordinary
the
strange
thing
was
that
she
could
not
decide
whether
he
was
ordinary
or
not
at
one
moment
his
face
presented
no
interest
at
another
she
saw
it
just
as
she
had
seen
it
framed
in
the
illuminated
aperture
of
the
on
the
previous
night
or
she
fancied
that
she
saw
it
thus
the
more
she
tried
to
distinguish
between
edwin
reality
and
her
fancies
concerning
edwin
the
less
she
succeeded
she
would
pronounce
positively
that
her
fancies
were
absurd
and
even
despicable
but
this
abrupt
positiveness
did
not
convince
supposing
that
he
was
after
all
marvellous
among
men
during
the
day
she
had
taken
advantage
of
the
mention
of
his
name
to
ascertain
discreetly
some
details
of
the
legendary
feat
by
which
as
a
boy
he
had
saved
his
father
from
destruction
the
details
were
vague
and
not
very
comprehensible
but
they
seemed
to
indicate
on
his
part
an
astounding
presence
of
mind
a
heroic
promptitude
in
action
assuredly
the
orgreaves
regarded
him
as
a
creature
out
of
the
common
run
and
at
the
same
time
they
all
had
the
air
of
feeling
rather
sorry
for
him
standing
near
the
hilda
listened
intently
for
the
sound
of
his
voice
among
the
other
voices
in
the
but
she
could
not
separate
it
from
the
rest
perhaps
he
was
keeping
silence
she
said
to
herself
yet
what
do
i
care
whether
he
is
keeping
silence
or
not
orgreave
remarked
in
the
suspense
glancing
ironically
at
his
wife
i
think
i
go
upstairs
and
do
an
hour
planning
they
are
likely
to
be
more
than
an
hour
i
expect
hilda
said
orgreave
quite
calm
but
taking
her
husband
quite
seriously
will
you
please
go
and
tell
those
young
men
from
me
that
supper
is
waiting
ii
of
course
hilda
obeyed
though
it
appeared
strange
to
her
that
orgreave
had
not
sent
alicia
on
such
an
errand
passing
out
of
the
bright
where
the
gas
was
lit
she
hesitated
a
moment
in
the
dark
broad
corridor
that
led
to
the
the
mission
she
felt
would
make
her
rather
prominent
in
front
of
edwin
clayhanger
the
stranger
and
she
had
an
objection
to
being
prominent
in
front
of
him
she
had
indeed
taken
every
possible
precaution
against
such
a
danger
how
silly
i
am
to
loiter
here
she
thought
i
might
be
alicia
the
boys
she
could
now
hear
were
discussing
french
literature
and
in
particular
victor
hugo
when
she
caught
the
name
of
victor
hugo
she
lifted
her
chin
and
moved
forward
a
little
she
worshipped
victor
hugo
with
a
passion
unreflecting
and
intense
simply
because
certain
detached
lines
from
his
poems
were
the
most
splendid
occupants
of
her
memory
dignifying
every
painful
or
sordid
souvenir
at
last
charlie
clear
gay
voice
said
it
all
very
well
and
victor
hugo
victor
hugo
but
you
can
say
what
you
like
there
a
lot
of
this
that
bear
skipping
your
worships
already
she
was
at
the
doorway
in
the
dusk
of
the
unlighted
chamber
the
faces
of
the
four
orgreaves
and
clayhanger
showed
like
pale
patches
on
the
gloom
not
a
line
she
said
fiercely
with
her
extremely
clear
articulation
she
had
no
right
to
make
such
a
statement
for
she
had
not
read
the
twentieth
part
of
victor
hugo
work
she
did
not
even
know
what
book
they
were
discussing
charlie
held
the
volume
lightly
in
his
hand
but
she
was
incensed
against
the
mere
levity
of
charlie
tone
she
saw
edwin
clayhanger
jump
at
the
startling
interruption
and
all
five
looked
round
she
could
feel
her
face
burning
charlie
quizzed
her
with
a
word
and
then
turned
to
edwin
clayhanger
for
support
do
think
that
some
of
it
dullish
teddy
edwin
clayhanger
shamefaced
looked
at
hilda
wistfully
as
if
in
apology
as
if
appealing
to
her
clemency
against
her
fierceness
and
said
slowly
well
yes
he
had
agreed
with
charlie
but
while
disagreeing
with
hilda
he
had
mysteriously
proved
to
her
that
she
had
been
right
in
saying
to
herself
on
the
previous
evening
like
the
incident
appeared
to
her
to
be
enormous
and
dramatic
she
moved
away
as
it
were
breathless
under
emotion
and
then
remembering
her
errand
threw
over
her
shoulder
orgreave
wants
to
know
when
you
coming
to
supper
iii
the
was
noisy
and
joyous
more
than
usually
so
on
account
of
the
presence
of
charlie
the
gayest
member
of
the
family
at
either
end
of
the
long
board
sat
and
orgreave
alicia
stood
by
orgreave
who
accepted
her
caresses
with
the
negligence
of
a
handsome
father
along
one
side
sat
hilda
next
to
janet
and
these
two
were
flanked
by
jimmie
and
johnnie
tall
unbending
apparently
determined
to
prove
by
a
politely
supercilious
demeanor
that
to
pass
a
whole
evening
thus
in
the
home
circle
was
considered
by
them
to
be
a
concession
on
their
part
rather
than
a
privilege
edwin
clayhanger
sat
exactly
opposite
to
hilda
with
charlie
for
sponsor
and
spectacles
gleamed
close
by
hilda
while
still
constrained
was
conscious
of
pleasure
in
the
scene
and
of
a
certain
pride
in
forming
part
of
it
these
prodigal
and
splendid
persons
respected
and
liked
her
even
loved
her
her
recitation
on
the
previous
evening
had
been
a
triumph
she
was
glad
that
she
had
shown
them
that
she
could
at
any
rate
do
one
thing
rather
well
but
she
was
equally
glad
that
she
had
obtained
janet
promise
to
avoid
any
discussion
of
her
qualities
or
her
situation
after
all
with
her
restraint
and
her
pitiful
assured
income
of
three
pounds
a
week
she
was
a
poor
little
creature
compared
with
the
easy
luxurious
beings
of
this
household
whose
upkeep
could
not
cost
less
than
three
pounds
a
day
janet
in
rich
and
complicated
white
and
glistening
with
jewels
at
hand
and
neck
was
a
princess
beside
her
she
hated
her
spare
black
frock
and
for
the
second
time
in
her
life
desired
expensive
clothes
markedly
feminine
she
felt
that
she
was
at
a
grave
disadvantage
and
that
to
remedy
this
disadvantage
would
be
necessary
not
only
dresses
and
precious
stones
but
an
instinctive
faculty
of
soft
allurement
which
she
had
not
each
gesture
of
janet
showed
seductive
grace
while
her
own
rare
gestures
were
stiffened
by
a
kind
of
masculine
harshness
every
time
that
the
and
modest
edwin
clayhanger
glanced
at
janet
and
included
herself
in
the
glance
she
fancied
that
he
was
unjustly
but
inevitably
misprising
herself
and
at
length
she
thought
why
did
i
make
janet
promise
that
i
should
be
talked
about
why
should
he
know
all
about
my
mourning
and
that
i
the
only
girl
in
the
five
towns
that
can
write
shorthand
why
should
i
be
afraid
to
recite
again
however
much
i
might
have
suffered
through
nervousness
if
i
recited
i
should
have
shown
i
not
such
a
poor
little
thing
as
all
that
why
am
i
such
a
baby
she
wilted
under
her
own
disdain
it
was
strange
to
think
that
edwin
clayhanger
scarcely
older
than
the
irresponsible
charlie
was
the
heir
to
an
important
business
was
potentially
a
rich
and
influential
man
had
not
orgreave
said
that
old
clayhanger
could
buy
up
all
the
orgreaves
if
he
chose
it
was
strange
to
think
that
this
wistful
and
apparently
timid
young
man
this
nice
boy
would
one
day
be
the
head
of
a
household
and
of
a
table
such
as
this
yes
it
would
assuredly
arrive
everything
happened
and
the
mother
of
that
household
would
it
be
she
her
imagination
leaped
far
into
the
future
as
she
exchanged
a
quiet
furtive
smile
with
orgreave
and
she
tried
to
see
herself
as
another
orgreave
a
strenuous
and
passionate
past
behind
her
honoured
beloved
teased
adored
but
she
could
not
quite
see
herself
thus
impossible
that
she
with
her
temperament
so
feverish
restive
and
peculiar
should
ever
reach
such
a
haven
it
was
fantastically
too
much
to
expect
and
yet
if
not
with
edwin
clayhanger
then
with
another
with
some
mysterious
being
whom
she
had
never
seen
did
not
everything
happen
but
then
equally
strange
and
terrible
misfortunes
might
be
lying
in
wait
for
her
the
indescribable
sharp
savour
of
life
was
in
her
nostrils
iv
the
conversation
had
turned
upon
bradlaugh
the
shameless
the
man
who
had
known
how
to
make
himself
the
centre
of
discussion
in
every
house
in
england
this
was
the
bradlaugh
year
the
apogee
of
his
notoriety
dozens
of
times
at
the
cedar
had
she
heard
the
shocking
name
of
bradlaugh
on
outraged
tongues
but
never
once
had
a
word
been
uttered
in
his
favour
the
public
opinion
of
the
was
absolutely
unanimous
in
reckoning
him
a
scoundrel
in
the
of
the
orgreaves
the
attitude
towards
him
was
different
his
was
not
precisely
defended
but
champions
of
his
right
to
sit
in
the
house
of
commons
were
numerous
hilda
grew
excited
and
even
more
it
was
as
if
she
were
in
momentary
expectation
of
being
challenged
by
these
hardy
debaters
are
not
a
her
interest
was
personal
the
interest
of
one
in
peril
compared
to
the
discussions
at
the
cedars
this
discussion
was
as
the
open
tossing
windy
sea
to
a
canal
the
talk
veered
into
mere
profane
politics
and
orgreave
entrenching
himself
behind
an
assumption
of
careless
disdain
was
severely
attacked
by
all
his
sons
except
jimmie
who
above
hilda
left
shoulder
pretended
to
share
the
paternal
scorn
the
indifference
of
hilda
to
politics
was
complete
she
began
to
feel
less
disturbed
she
began
to
dream
then
she
suddenly
heard
through
her
dream
the
name
of
bradlaugh
again
and
edwin
clayhanger
in
response
to
a
direct
question
from
orgreave
was
saying
you
ca
help
what
you
believe
you
ca
make
yourself
believe
anything
and
i
do
see
why
you
should
either
there
no
virtue
in
believing
and
tom
was
crying
hooray
hilda
was
thunderstruck
she
was
blinded
as
though
by
a
mystic
revelation
she
wanted
to
exult
and
to
exult
with
all
the
ardour
of
her
soul
this
truth
which
edwin
clayhanger
had
enunciated
she
had
indeed
always
been
vaguely
aware
of
but
now
in
a
flash
she
felt
it
she
faced
it
she
throbbed
to
its
authenticity
and
was
free
it
solved
every
difficulty
and
loosed
the
load
that
for
months
past
had
wearied
her
back
there
no
virtue
in
believing
it
was
fundamental
it
was
the
gift
of
life
and
of
peace
her
soul
shouted
as
she
realized
that
just
there
in
that
instant
at
that
table
a
new
epoch
had
dawned
for
her
never
would
she
forget
the
instant
and
the
scene
scene
of
her
orgreave
remonstrated
with
mild
sadness
no
virtue
in
believing
eh
mr
edwin
and
hilda
under
the
ageing
lady
grieved
glance
tried
to
quench
the
exultation
on
her
face
somewhat
like
a
child
trapped
but
she
could
not
tom
again
cried
hooray
his
tone
however
grated
on
her
sensibility
it
lacked
emotion
it
was
the
tone
of
a
pugilist
backer
and
janet
permitted
herself
some
pleasantry
and
charlie
became
frankly
facetious
was
it
conceivable
that
charlie
could
be
interested
in
religion
she
liked
him
very
much
partly
because
he
and
she
had
learnt
to
understand
each
other
at
the
and
partly
because
his
curly
hair
and
his
candid
smile
compelled
sympathy
but
her
esteem
for
him
had
limits
it
was
astonishing
that
a
family
otherwise
simply
perfect
should
be
content
with
jocosity
when
jocosity
was
so
obviously
out
of
place
were
they
then
afraid
of
being
serious
edwin
clayhanger
was
not
laughing
he
had
blushed
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
with
the
extremest
intensity
studying
him
careless
of
the
danger
that
his
gaze
might
catch
hers
she
was
lost
in
him
and
then
he
caught
her
and
burning
with
honest
shame
she
looked
downwards
chapter
vi
in
the
garden
i
that
evening
janet
did
not
stay
long
in
hilda
bedroom
having
perceived
that
hilda
was
in
one
of
her
dark
dreamy
moods
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
hilda
lowered
the
gas
a
little
and
then
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
wider
and
drawing
aside
the
blind
looked
forth
the
night
was
obscure
and
warm
and
a
wet
wind
moved
furtively
about
in
the
of
the
garden
the
window
was
at
the
side
of
the
house
it
gave
on
the
west
and
commanded
the
new
house
just
finished
by
orgreave
for
the
clayhanger
family
the
block
of
this
generously
planned
dwelling
rose
massively
at
a
distance
of
perhaps
forty
feet
dwarfing
a
whole
row
of
cottages
in
the
small
street
behind
lane
end
house
its
various
chimneypots
stood
out
a
deeper
black
against
the
enigmatic
sky
beyond
the
clayhanger
as
yet
uncultivated
and
its
high
boundary
wall
ran
the
great
silent
thoroughfare
trafalgar
road
whose
reigned
in
the
nocturnal
silence
that
the
last
had
left
in
its
wake
hilda
gazed
at
the
house
and
it
seemed
strange
to
her
that
the
house
which
but
a
short
time
ago
had
no
existence
whatever
and
was
yet
cold
and
soulless
was
destined
to
be
the
living
home
of
a
family
with
history
in
its
walls
and
memories
clinging
about
it
the
formidable
magic
of
life
was
always
thus
discovering
itself
to
her
so
that
she
could
not
look
upon
even
an
untenanted
villa
without
a
secret
thrill
and
the
impenetrable
sky
above
was
not
more
charmed
and
enchanted
than
those
brick
walls
when
she
reflected
that
one
day
the
wistful
boyish
edwin
clayhanger
would
be
the
master
of
that
house
that
in
that
house
his
will
would
be
stronger
than
any
other
will
the
mystery
that
hides
beneath
the
surface
of
all
things
surged
up
and
overwhelmed
thought
and
although
scarcely
a
couple
of
hours
had
elapsed
since
the
key
of
the
new
life
had
been
put
into
her
hands
she
could
not
make
an
answer
when
she
asked
herself
am
i
happy
or
unhappy
ii
the
sound
of
young
men
voices
came
round
the
corner
of
the
house
from
the
lawn
some
of
the
brothers
orgreave
were
saying
to
edwin
clayhanger
in
the
porch
she
knew
that
they
had
been
chatting
a
long
time
in
the
hall
after
clayhanger
had
bidden
adieu
to
the
rest
of
the
family
she
wondered
what
they
had
been
talking
about
and
what
young
men
did
in
general
talk
about
when
they
were
by
themselves
and
confidential
in
her
fancy
she
endowed
their
conversations
with
the
inexplicable
attractiveness
of
masculinity
as
masculinity
is
understood
by
women
alone
she
had
an
intense
desire
to
overhear
such
a
conversation
and
she
felt
that
she
would
affront
the
unguessed
perils
of
it
with
delight
drinking
it
up
eagerly
every
drop
even
were
the
draught
deadly
meanwhile
the
mere
inarticulate
sound
of
those
distant
voices
pleased
her
and
she
was
glad
that
she
was
listening
and
that
the
boys
knew
it
not
silence
succeeded
the
banging
of
the
front
door
and
then
after
a
pause
she
was
startled
to
hear
the
crunching
of
gravel
almost
under
her
window
in
alarm
she
dropped
the
blind
but
continued
to
peer
between
the
edge
of
the
blind
and
the
at
one
point
the
contiguous
demesnes
of
the
orgreaves
and
the
clayhangers
were
separated
only
by
a
poor
sparse
hedge
a
few
yards
in
length
somebody
was
pushing
his
way
through
this
hedge
it
was
edwin
clayhanger
despite
the
darkness
of
the
night
she
could
be
sure
that
the
dim
figure
was
edwin
clayhanger
by
the
peculiar
exaggerated
swing
of
the
loose
arms
he
passed
the
hedge
carelessly
brushed
his
clothes
with
his
hands
and
walked
slowly
up
the
clayhanger
garden
towards
the
new
house
and
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
house
was
lost
still
she
could
catch
vague
noises
of
movement
in
a
state
of
extreme
excitation
she
wondered
what
he
could
be
doing
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
and
she
were
sharing
the
night
together
iii
she
thought
i
would
give
anything
to
be
able
to
speak
to
him
privately
and
ask
him
a
little
more
about
what
he
said
i
ought
to
i
may
never
see
him
again
at
any
rate
i
may
never
have
another
chance
he
may
have
meant
something
else
he
may
not
have
been
serious
the
skin
of
her
face
prickled
and
a
physical
wave
of
emotion
seemed
to
sweep
downwards
through
her
whole
body
the
thrill
was
exquisite
but
it
was
intimidating
she
whispered
to
herself
i
could
go
downstairs
and
outside
and
find
him
and
just
ask
him
the
next
instant
she
was
opening
the
door
of
her
bedroom
no
all
the
household
had
not
yet
retired
for
a
light
was
still
burning
in
the
corridor
nevertheless
she
might
go
she
descended
the
stairs
asking
herself
aghast
why
am
i
doing
this
another
light
was
burning
in
the
hall
and
through
the
slit
of
the
door
of
the
she
could
see
light
she
stood
hesitant
then
she
heard
the
striking
of
a
match
in
the
and
she
boldly
pushed
the
door
open
tom
with
a
book
before
him
was
lighting
his
pipe
hello
he
said
what
the
matter
oh
nothing
she
replied
only
i
just
going
to
walk
about
in
the
garden
a
minute
i
sha
go
to
sleep
unless
i
do
she
spoke
quite
easily
all
serene
he
agreed
so
long
as
you
keep
off
the
grass
it
bound
to
be
damp
i
unchain
the
door
for
you
shall
i
she
said
that
she
could
unfasten
the
door
for
herself
and
he
did
not
insist
the
hospitality
of
the
orgreaves
was
never
irksome
tom
had
scarcely
from
his
chair
i
sha
be
long
she
added
casually
that
all
right
hilda
he
said
i
not
going
to
bed
just
yet
all
the
others
gone
he
nodded
she
pulled
the
door
to
tripped
delicately
through
the
hall
and
unchained
the
heavy
front
door
as
quietly
as
she
could
iv
she
was
outside
amid
all
the
influences
of
the
night
gradually
her
eyes
accustomed
themselves
again
to
the
gloom
she
passed
along
the
facade
of
the
house
until
she
came
to
the
corner
where
the
breeze
surprised
her
and
whence
she
could
discern
the
other
house
and
across
the
indistinct
hedge
the
other
garden
where
was
edwin
clayhanger
was
he
wandering
in
the
other
garden
or
had
he
entered
the
house
then
a
brief
flare
lit
up
a
lower
window
of
the
dark
mass
for
a
few
instants
he
was
within
she
hesitated
should
she
go
forward
or
should
she
go
back
at
length
she
went
forward
and
finding
in
the
hedge
the
gap
which
clayhanger
had
made
forced
her
way
through
it
her
skirt
was
torn
by
an
obstinate
twig
quite
calmly
she
bent
down
and
with
her
fingers
examined
the
rent
it
was
not
important
she
was
now
in
the
garden
of
the
clayhangers
and
he
whom
she
sought
was
moving
somewhere
in
the
house
supposing
i
meet
him
she
thought
what
shall
i
say
to
him
she
did
not
know
what
she
should
say
to
him
nor
why
she
had
entered
upon
this
singular
adventure
but
the
consciousness
of
self
the
fine
disturbing
sense
of
being
alive
in
every
vein
and
nerve
was
a
rich
reward
for
her
audacity
she
wished
that
that
tense
moment
of
expectation
might
endure
for
ever
she
approached
the
house
trembling
it
was
not
by
volition
that
she
walked
over
the
uneven
clayey
ground
but
by
instinct
she
was
in
front
of
the
and
here
she
hesitated
again
apparently
waiting
for
a
sign
from
the
house
she
glanced
timidly
about
her
as
though
in
fear
of
marauders
that
might
spring
out
upon
her
from
the
shadow
just
over
the
boundary
wall
the
placid
flame
of
a
peeped
then
feeling
with
her
feet
for
the
steps
she
ascended
into
the
shelter
of
the
porch
almost
at
the
same
moment
there
was
another
flare
behind
the
glass
of
the
door
she
heard
the
sound
of
unlatching
the
flare
expired
she
was
absolutely
now
the
door
opened
grating
on
some
dirt
or
gravel
who
there
demanded
a
queer
shaking
voice
she
could
see
his
form
me
she
answered
in
a
harsh
tone
which
was
the
expression
of
her
dismay
the
deed
was
done
irretrievably
in
her
bedroom
she
had
said
that
she
would
try
to
speak
with
him
and
lo
they
were
face
to
face
in
the
dark
in
secret
her
terror
was
now
at
any
rate
desperately
calm
she
had
plunged
she
was
falling
into
the
deep
sea
she
was
hopelessly
cut
off
from
the
past
oh
came
the
uncertain
voice
weakly
did
you
want
me
did
anyone
want
me
she
heard
the
door
being
closed
behind
him
she
told
him
with
peculiar
curtness
how
she
had
seen
him
from
her
window
and
how
she
wished
to
ask
him
an
important
question
i
dare
say
you
think
it
very
queer
of
me
she
added
not
at
all
he
said
with
an
insincerity
that
annoyed
her
yes
you
do
she
sharply
insisted
but
i
want
to
know
what
did
she
want
to
know
i
want
to
know
did
you
mean
it
when
you
said
you
know
at
supper
that
there
no
virtue
in
believing
he
stammered
did
i
say
there
was
no
virtue
in
believing
she
cried
out
irritated
of
course
you
did
do
you
mean
to
say
you
can
say
a
thing
like
that
and
then
forget
about
it
if
it
true
it
one
of
the
most
wonderful
things
that
were
ever
said
and
that
why
i
wanted
to
know
if
you
meant
it
of
whether
you
were
only
saying
it
because
it
sounded
clever
she
stopped
momentarily
wondering
why
she
was
thus
implying
an
untruth
for
the
fact
was
that
she
had
never
doubted
that
he
had
been
in
earnest
that
what
they
always
doing
in
that
house
you
know
being
clever
she
went
on
in
a
tone
apparently
inimical
to
house
yes
came
the
voice
i
meant
it
why
and
the
voice
was
so
simple
and
so
sincere
that
it
pierced
straight
to
her
heart
and
changed
her
secret
mood
swiftly
to
the
religious
so
that
she
really
was
occupied
by
the
thoughts
with
which
a
moment
previously
she
had
only
pretended
to
be
occupied
and
the
splendour
of
the
revelation
was
renewed
nevertheless
some
impulse
perverse
or
defensive
compelled
her
to
assume
a
doubt
of
his
assurance
she
suspected
that
had
she
not
adopted
this
tactic
she
might
have
melted
before
him
in
gratitude
you
did
she
murmured
she
thanked
him
after
that
rather
coldly
and
they
talked
a
little
about
the
mere
worry
of
these
religious
questions
he
protested
that
they
never
worried
him
and
reaffirmed
his
original
proposition
i
hope
you
are
right
she
said
softly
in
a
thrilled
voice
she
was
thinking
that
this
was
the
most
wonderful
miraculous
experience
that
she
had
ever
had
v
silence
now
she
thought
i
must
go
back
inwardly
she
gave
a
delicious
sigh
but
just
as
she
was
about
to
take
her
prim
leave
the
figure
of
her
companion
stepped
out
into
the
garden
by
jove
said
edwin
clayhanger
it
beginning
to
rain
i
do
believe
the
wind
blew
and
she
felt
rain
on
her
cheek
clayhanger
advised
her
to
stand
against
the
other
wall
of
the
porch
for
better
protection
she
obeyed
he
the
porch
but
was
still
exposed
to
the
rain
she
called
him
to
her
side
already
he
was
so
close
that
she
could
have
touched
his
shoulder
by
outstretching
her
arm
oh
i
all
right
he
said
lightly
and
did
not
move
you
need
be
afraid
of
me
she
was
hurt
that
he
had
refused
her
invitation
to
approach
her
the
next
instant
she
would
have
given
her
tongue
not
to
have
uttered
those
words
but
she
was
in
such
a
tingling
state
of
extreme
sensitiveness
as
rendered
it
impossible
for
her
to
exercise
a
normal
scarcely
conscious
of
what
she
did
she
asked
him
the
time
he
struck
a
match
to
look
at
his
watch
the
wind
blew
the
match
out
but
she
saw
his
wistful
face
with
his
disordered
hair
under
the
hat
it
had
the
quality
of
a
vision
he
offered
to
get
a
light
in
the
house
but
abruptly
she
said
good
night
then
they
were
shaking
hands
she
knew
not
how
or
why
she
could
not
loose
his
hand
she
thought
never
have
i
held
a
hand
so
honest
as
this
hand
at
last
she
dropped
it
they
stood
silent
while
a
trap
rattled
up
trafalgar
road
it
was
as
if
she
was
bound
to
remain
moveless
until
the
sounds
of
the
trap
had
died
away
she
walked
proudly
out
into
the
rain
he
called
to
her
i
say
miss
lessways
but
she
did
not
stop
in
a
minute
she
was
back
again
in
lane
end
house
that
you
tom
voice
from
the
yes
she
answered
clearly
i
put
the
chain
on
good
night
good
night
thanks
she
ascended
the
stairs
smiling
to
herself
with
the
raindrops
fresh
on
her
cheek
in
her
mind
were
no
distinct
thoughts
either
concerning
the
of
belief
or
the
new
epoch
or
edwin
clayhanger
or
even
the
strangeness
of
her
behaviour
but
all
her
being
vibrated
to
the
mysterious
and
beautiful
romance
of
existence
chapter
vii
the
next
meeting
i
for
several
days
the
town
of
bursley
was
to
hilda
simply
a
place
made
perilous
and
redoubtable
by
the
apprehension
of
meeting
edwin
clayhanger
accidentally
in
the
streets
thereof
and
the
burden
of
her
meditations
was
what
can
he
have
thought
of
me
she
had
said
nothing
to
anybody
of
the
adventure
in
the
garden
and
with
the
strangest
ingenuous
confidence
she
assumed
that
edwin
clayhanger
too
would
keep
an
absolute
silence
about
it
she
had
therefore
naught
to
fear
except
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
mind
she
did
not
blame
herself
it
never
occurred
to
her
to
do
so
but
she
rather
wondered
at
herself
inimically
prophesying
that
one
day
her
impulsiveness
would
throw
her
into
some
serious
difficulty
the
memory
of
the
night
beautifully
coloured
her
whole
daily
existence
in
spite
of
her
avoidance
of
the
town
due
to
her
dread
of
seeing
clayhanger
she
was
constantly
thinking
but
this
can
not
continue
for
ever
one
day
i
am
bound
to
meet
him
again
and
she
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
that
day
it
came
with
inevitable
quickness
the
last
day
but
one
of
june
was
appointed
throughout
the
country
for
the
celebration
of
the
centenary
of
sunday
schools
neither
hilda
nor
any
of
the
orgreave
children
had
ever
seen
the
inside
of
a
sunday
school
and
the
tendency
up
at
lane
end
house
was
to
condescend
towards
the
festival
as
towards
a
rejoicing
of
the
proletariat
but
in
face
of
the
magnitude
of
the
affair
looming
more
enormous
as
it
approached
this
attitude
could
not
be
maintained
the
preparations
for
the
centenary
filled
newspapers
and
changed
the
physiognomy
of
towns
and
on
the
morning
of
the
ceremonial
service
gloriously
flattered
by
the
sun
there
was
candid
excitement
at
the
of
the
orgreaves
orgreave
regretted
that
pressure
of
work
would
prevent
him
from
seeing
the
fun
tom
was
going
to
see
the
fun
at
hanbridge
jimmie
and
johnnie
were
going
to
see
the
fun
but
they
would
not
say
where
the
servants
were
going
to
see
the
fun
charlie
had
returned
to
london
alicia
wanted
to
go
and
see
the
fun
but
as
she
was
flushed
and
feverish
orgreave
forbade
and
decided
to
remain
at
home
with
alicia
otherwise
even
orgreave
would
have
gone
to
see
the
fun
hilda
and
janet
apparently
hesitated
about
going
but
orgreave
pointing
out
that
there
could
not
under
the
most
favourable
circumstance
be
another
centenary
of
sunday
schools
for
at
least
a
hundred
years
sarcastically
urged
them
to
set
forth
the
fact
was
as
janet
teasingly
told
him
while
she
hung
on
his
neck
that
he
wished
to
accentuate
as
much
as
possible
his
own
martyrdom
to
industry
were
not
all
the
shops
and
offices
of
the
five
towns
closed
did
not
every
member
of
his
family
save
those
detained
by
illness
attend
the
historic
spectacle
of
the
centenary
he
alone
had
sacrificed
pleasure
to
work
thus
janet
loving
ironic
smiles
foretold
would
the
father
of
the
brood
discourse
during
the
next
few
days
ii
hilda
and
janet
accordingly
went
down
a
and
sunlit
trafalgar
road
together
janet
was
wearing
still
another
white
dress
and
hilda
to
her
marked
relief
had
abandoned
black
for
a
frock
made
by
a
dressmaker
in
bleakridge
it
was
orgreave
herself
who
had
first
counselled
hilda
if
she
hated
black
as
she
said
she
did
to
abandon
black
the
entire
family
chorus
had
approved
the
risk
of
encountering
edwin
clayhanger
on
that
day
of
multitudes
was
surely
infinitesimal
nevertheless
in
six
minutes
the
improbable
had
occurred
at
the
corner
of
trafalgar
road
and
duck
square
janet
attracted
by
the
sight
of
banners
in
the
distance
turned
to
the
left
along
wedgwood
street
and
past
the
front
of
clayhanger
shop
theoretically
shops
were
closed
but
one
shutter
of
clayhanger
was
down
and
in
its
place
stood
edwin
clayhanger
hilda
felt
her
features
stiffening
into
a
sort
of
wilful
and
insincere
hostility
as
she
shook
hands
within
the
darkness
of
the
shop
she
saw
the
figure
of
two
dowdy
women
doubtless
the
sisters
of
whom
janet
had
told
her
they
disappeared
before
janet
and
hilda
entered
it
has
happened
i
have
seen
him
again
hilda
said
to
herself
as
she
sat
in
the
shop
listening
to
janet
and
to
edwin
clayhanger
it
appeared
likely
that
edwin
clayhanger
would
join
them
in
the
enterprise
of
witnessing
the
historic
spectacle
a
few
minutes
later
everybody
was
startled
by
the
gay
apparition
of
osmond
orgreave
swinging
his
cane
curiosity
had
been
too
much
for
industriousness
and
osmond
orgreave
had
yielded
himself
to
the
general
interest
oh
father
cried
janet
what
a
deceitful
thing
you
are
only
a
day
or
two
ago
hilda
was
thinking
i
had
never
even
heard
of
him
and
his
shop
seemed
so
strange
and
romantic
to
me
and
now
i
am
sitting
in
his
shop
like
an
old
friend
and
nobody
suspects
that
he
and
i
have
had
a
secret
meeting
the
shop
itself
seemed
to
be
important
and
prosperous
orgreave
having
decided
for
pleasure
was
anxious
to
find
it
at
once
and
under
his
impatience
they
left
the
shop
janet
went
out
first
with
her
gay
father
edwin
clayhanger
waited
respectfully
for
hilda
to
pass
but
just
as
she
was
about
to
step
forth
she
caught
sight
of
george
cannon
coming
along
the
opposite
side
of
wedgwood
street
in
the
direction
of
trafalgar
road
he
was
in
close
conversation
with
another
man
she
kept
within
the
shelter
of
the
shop
until
the
two
had
gone
by
she
did
not
want
to
meet
george
cannon
with
whom
she
had
not
had
speech
since
the
interview
at
the
cedars
he
had
written
to
her
about
the
property
sales
and
she
had
replied
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
hesitate
to
meet
him
but
she
wished
not
to
complicate
the
situation
she
thought
if
he
saw
me
he
come
across
and
speak
to
me
and
i
might
have
to
introduce
him
to
all
these
people
and
goodness
knows
what
the
contretemps
caused
her
heart
to
beat
when
they
emerged
from
the
shop
janet
a
few
yards
ahead
with
orgreave
was
beckoning
iii
hilda
stood
on
a
barrel
by
the
side
of
edwin
clayhanger
on
another
barrel
there
from
the
top
of
luke
square
they
surveyed
a
vast
rectangular
carpet
of
upturned
faces
that
made
a
pattern
of
pale
dots
on
a
coloured
and
black
groundwork
nearly
all
the
children
of
bursley
thousands
upon
thousands
were
massed
in
the
square
wedged
in
tight
together
so
that
there
seemed
not
to
be
an
inch
of
space
anywhere
between
the
shuttered
shop
fronts
on
the
east
of
the
square
and
the
shuttered
shop
fronts
on
the
west
of
the
square
at
the
bottom
of
the
square
a
row
of
railway
lorries
were
crammed
with
tiny
babes
or
such
they
appeared
toddlers
too
weak
to
walk
in
processions
at
the
top
of
the
square
a
large
platform
full
of
bearded
adults
rose
like
an
island
out
of
the
unconscious
sea
of
infants
and
from
every
window
of
every
house
adults
looked
down
in
safe
ease
upon
that
wavy
ocean
over
which
banners
gleamed
in
the
dazzling
and
fierce
sunshine
she
might
have
put
up
her
sunshade
but
she
would
not
do
so
she
thought
if
all
those
children
can
stand
the
sun
without
fainting
i
can
she
was
extraordinarily
affected
by
the
mere
sight
of
the
immense
multitude
of
children
they
were
as
helpless
and
as
fatalistic
as
sheep
utterly
at
the
mercy
of
the
adults
who
had
herded
them
there
was
about
them
a
collective
wistfulness
that
cut
the
heart
to
dwell
on
the
idea
of
it
would
have
brought
her
to
tears
and
when
the
multitude
sang
so
lustily
so
willingly
so
bravely
pouring
forth
with
the
brass
instruments
a
volume
of
tone
enormous
and
majestic
she
had
a
tightness
of
the
throat
that
was
excrutiating
the
centenary
of
sunday
schools
was
quite
other
than
she
had
expected
she
had
not
bargained
for
these
emotions
it
was
after
the
hymn
there
is
a
fountain
filled
with
blood
during
the
quietude
of
a
speech
that
edwin
clayhanger
taking
up
an
evangelistic
phrase
in
the
speech
whispered
to
her
more
blood
what
she
asked
amazed
by
his
ironical
accent
which
jarred
on
her
mood
and
also
by
his
familiar
manner
of
leaning
towards
her
and
dropping
the
words
in
her
ear
well
he
said
look
at
it
it
only
wants
the
ganges
at
the
bottom
of
the
square
evidently
for
edwin
clayhanger
all
religions
were
equally
heathenish
she
was
quite
startled
out
of
her
amazement
and
her
response
was
an
almost
humble
entreaty
not
to
make
fun
the
next
moment
she
regretted
that
she
had
not
answered
him
with
sharp
firmness
she
was
somewhat
out
of
humour
with
him
he
had
begun
by
losing
sight
of
orgreave
and
janet
and
of
course
it
was
hopeless
to
seek
for
them
in
those
thronging
streets
around
luke
square
then
he
had
said
to
her
in
a
most
peculiar
tone
i
hope
you
did
catch
cold
in
the
rain
the
other
night
and
she
had
not
liked
that
she
had
regarded
it
as
a
fault
in
tact
almost
as
a
sexual
disloyalty
on
his
part
to
refer
at
all
to
the
scene
in
the
garden
finally
his
way
of
negotiating
with
the
barrel
man
for
the
use
of
two
barrels
had
been
lacking
for
hilda
in
the
qualities
of
largeness
and
masterfulness
any
one
of
the
orgreave
boys
would
she
was
sure
have
carried
the
thing
off
in
a
more
worldly
manner
the
climax
of
the
service
came
with
the
singing
of
when
i
survey
the
wondrous
cross
the
physical
effect
of
it
on
hilda
was
nearly
overwhelming
the
terrible
and
sublime
words
seemed
to
surge
upon
her
charged
with
all
the
multitudinous
significance
of
the
crowd
she
was
profoundly
stirred
and
to
prevent
an
outburst
of
tears
she
shook
her
head
what
the
matter
said
edwin
clayhanger
clumsy
dolt
she
thought
have
you
got
enough
sense
to
leave
me
alone
and
she
said
aloud
passionately
transforming
her
weakness
into
ferocity
that
the
most
splendid
religious
verse
ever
written
you
can
say
what
you
like
it
worth
while
believing
anything
if
you
can
sing
words
like
that
and
mean
them
he
agreed
that
the
hymn
was
fine
do
you
know
who
wrote
it
she
demanded
threateningly
he
did
not
she
was
delighted
watts
of
course
she
said
with
a
scornful
sneer
what
did
janet
mean
by
saying
that
he
had
read
simply
everything
iv
an
episode
which
supervened
close
to
their
barrels
did
a
great
deal
to
intensify
the
hostility
of
her
mood
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
an
old
man
who
had
been
trying
to
force
his
way
through
it
was
being
guyed
by
a
gang
of
louts
who
had
surrounded
an
barrow
suddenly
she
recognized
this
old
man
his
name
was
shushions
he
was
a
familiar
figure
of
the
streets
of
turnhill
and
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
oldest
sunday
school
teacher
in
the
five
towns
he
was
indeed
exceedingly
old
foolish
and
undignified
in
senility
and
the
louts
were
odiously
jeering
at
his
defenceless
dotage
and
a
young
policeman
was
obviously
with
the
louts
and
against
the
aged
fatuous
victim
hilda
gave
an
exclamation
of
revolt
and
called
upon
edwin
clayhanger
to
go
to
the
rescue
of
shushions
not
he
however
but
she
jumped
down
first
and
pushed
towards
the
barrow
she
made
the
path
and
he
followed
she
protested
to
the
policeman
and
he
too
modestly
seconded
her
yet
the
policeman
ignoring
her
addressed
himself
to
edwin
clayhanger
hilda
was
infuriated
it
appeared
that
old
shushions
had
had
a
ticket
for
the
platform
but
had
lost
it
he
must
be
got
on
to
the
platform
somehow
she
decided
with
a
fiery
glance
but
edwin
clayhanger
seemed
to
be
incapable
of
an
heroic
action
he
hesitated
the
policeman
hesitated
fortunately
the
plight
of
the
doting
oldest
sunday
school
teacher
in
the
five
towns
had
been
observed
from
the
platform
and
two
fussy
rosetted
officials
bustled
up
and
offered
to
take
charge
of
him
and
hilda
dissolving
in
painful
pity
bent
over
him
softly
and
arranged
his
disordered
clothes
she
was
weeping
shall
we
go
back
to
our
barrels
edwin
clayhanger
rather
sheepishly
suggested
after
shushions
had
been
dragged
away
but
she
would
not
go
back
to
the
barrels
i
think
it
time
we
set
about
to
find
janet
and
orgreave
she
replied
coldly
and
they
drew
out
of
the
crowd
she
was
profoundly
deceived
in
edwin
clayhanger
so
famous
for
his
presence
of
mind
in
saving
from
destruction
she
did
not
know
what
he
ought
to
have
done
she
made
no
attempt
to
conceive
what
he
ought
to
have
done
but
that
he
ought
to
have
done
something
something
decisive
and
grandly
masculine
she
was
sure
v
later
after
sundry
adventures
and
having
found
orgreave
and
janet
they
stood
at
the
tail
of
the
which
janet
had
decided
should
carry
her
up
to
bleakridge
and
edwin
shook
hands
yes
hilda
was
profoundly
deceived
in
him
nevertheless
his
wistful
and
honest
glance
as
he
parted
from
her
had
its
effect
if
he
had
not
one
quality
he
had
another
she
tried
hard
to
maintain
her
scorn
of
him
but
it
was
exceedingly
difficult
to
do
so
orgreave
wiped
his
brow
as
the
car
jolted
them
out
of
the
tumult
of
the
centenary
it
was
hot
but
he
did
not
seem
to
be
in
the
slightest
degree
fatigued
or
dispirited
whereas
janet
put
back
her
head
and
shut
her
eyes
caught
sight
of
a
friend
of
yours
this
morning
hilda
he
said
pleasantly
oh
yes
cannon
by
the
way
i
forgot
to
tell
you
yesterday
that
his
famous
newspaper
has
come
to
an
end
he
spoke
as
it
were
with
calm
sympathy
yes
well
it
not
surprising
not
surprising
nothing
ever
stood
up
against
the
yet
hilda
was
saddened
when
they
reached
lane
end
house
a
few
seconds
in
front
of
the
hurrying
and
apologetic
servants
orgreave
told
her
that
george
cannon
had
called
to
see
her
and
had
left
a
note
for
her
she
ran
up
to
her
room
with
the
note
it
said
merely
that
the
writer
wished
to
have
an
interview
with
her
at
once
book
iii
her
burden
chapter
i
hilda
indispensable
i
hilda
made
no
response
of
any
kind
to
george
cannon
request
for
an
immediate
interview
allowing
day
after
day
to
pass
in
inactivity
and
wondering
the
while
how
she
might
excuse
or
explain
her
singular
conduct
when
circumstances
should
bring
the
situation
to
a
head
she
knew
that
she
ought
either
to
go
over
to
turnhill
or
write
him
with
an
appointment
to
see
her
at
lane
end
house
but
she
did
nothing
nor
did
she
say
a
word
of
the
matter
to
janet
in
the
bedroom
at
nights
all
that
she
could
tell
herself
was
that
she
did
not
want
to
see
george
cannon
she
was
not
honestly
persuaded
that
she
feared
to
see
him
in
the
meantime
edwin
clayhanger
was
invisible
though
the
removal
of
the
clayhanger
household
to
the
new
residence
at
bleakridge
had
made
a
considerable
stir
of
straw
and
litter
in
trafalgar
road
on
tuesday
in
the
following
week
she
received
a
letter
from
sarah
gailey
it
was
brought
up
to
her
room
early
in
the
morning
by
a
alicia
orgreave
and
she
read
it
as
she
lay
in
bed
sarah
gailey
struggling
with
the
complexities
of
the
cedars
away
in
hornsey
was
unwell
and
gloomily
desolate
she
wrote
that
she
suffered
from
terrible
headaches
on
waking
and
that
she
was
often
feverish
and
that
she
had
no
energy
whatever
i
am
at
a
very
trying
age
for
a
woman
she
said
i
do
know
whether
you
understand
but
i
come
to
a
time
of
life
that
really
upsets
one
above
a
bit
and
i
fit
for
nothing
hilda
understood
she
was
flattered
even
touched
by
this
confidence
it
made
her
feel
older
and
more
important
in
the
world
and
a
whole
generation
away
from
alicia
who
was
drawing
up
the
blind
with
the
cries
and
awkward
gestures
of
a
prattling
infant
to
the
letter
there
was
a
postscript
has
george
been
to
see
you
yet
about
me
he
wrote
me
he
should
but
i
have
heard
since
in
fact
i
been
waiting
to
hear
i
say
nothing
about
that
yet
i
ashamed
you
should
be
bothered
it
so
important
for
you
to
have
a
good
holiday
again
much
love
the
prim
handwriting
got
smaller
and
smaller
towards
the
end
of
the
postscript
and
the
end
of
the
page
and
the
last
lines
were
perfectly
parallel
with
the
lower
edge
of
the
paper
all
the
others
sloped
feebly
downwards
from
left
to
right
oh
piped
alicia
from
the
window
maggie
clayhanger
has
got
her
curtains
up
in
the
oh
are
they
proud
things
i
do
believe
she
caught
me
staring
at
her
and
alicia
withdrew
abruptly
into
the
room
blushing
for
her
detected
sin
of
ungenteel
curiosity
she
bumped
down
on
the
bed
three
days
more
she
said
not
counting
four
counting
school
alicia
nodded
her
finger
in
her
mouth
is
it
horrid
going
to
school
on
a
day
like
this
i
hear
you
and
janet
are
off
up
to
hillport
this
afternoon
again
to
play
tennis
you
do
have
times
no
said
hilda
i
got
to
go
to
turnhill
this
afternoon
but
janet
told
me
you
were
her
glance
fell
on
the
letter
is
it
business
yes
the
child
was
impressed
and
her
change
of
tone
her
frank
awe
gave
pleasure
to
hilda
vanity
shall
i
go
and
tell
jane
she
is
near
dressed
yes
do
off
scampered
alicia
leaving
the
door
unlatched
behind
her
hilda
gazed
at
the
letter
holding
it
limply
in
her
left
hand
amid
the
soft
disorder
of
the
counterpane
it
had
come
to
her
an
intolerably
pathetic
messenger
and
accuser
out
of
the
exacerbating
frowsiness
of
the
cedars
yesterday
afternoon
sarah
gailey
was
writing
it
with
sighs
at
the
desk
in
her
stuffy
uncomfortable
bedroom
as
hilda
gazed
at
the
formation
of
the
words
she
could
see
the
unhappy
sarah
gailey
writing
them
and
the
letter
was
like
a
bit
of
sarah
self
magically
and
disconcertingly
projected
into
the
spacious
laughing
home
of
the
orgreaves
and
into
the
mysterious
new
happiness
that
was
forming
around
hilda
the
orgreaves
so
far
as
hilda
could
discover
had
no
real
anxieties
they
were
a
joyous
lot
favoured
alike
by
temperament
and
by
fortune
and
she
hilda
what
real
anxieties
had
she
none
she
was
sure
of
a
small
but
adequate
income
her
grief
for
her
mother
was
assuaged
the
problem
of
her
soul
no
longer
troubled
in
part
it
had
been
solved
and
in
part
it
had
faded
imperceptibly
away
nor
was
she
exercised
about
the
future
about
the
life
instead
of
rushing
ardently
to
meet
the
future
she
felt
content
to
wait
for
its
coming
why
disturb
oneself
she
was
free
she
was
enjoying
existence
with
the
orgreaves
yes
she
was
happy
in
this
roseate
passivity
the
letter
shook
her
arousing
as
it
did
the
sharp
sense
of
her
indebtedness
to
sarah
gailey
who
alone
had
succoured
her
in
her
long
period
of
despairing
infelicity
had
she
guessed
that
it
was
sarah
gailey
affair
upon
which
george
cannon
had
desired
to
see
her
she
would
not
have
delayed
an
hour
no
reluctance
to
meet
george
cannon
would
have
caused
her
to
tarry
but
she
had
not
guessed
the
idea
had
never
occurred
to
her
she
rose
picked
up
the
envelope
from
the
carpet
carefully
replaced
the
letter
in
it
and
laid
it
with
love
on
the
glittering
through
the
unlatched
door
she
heard
a
tramping
of
unshod
masculine
feet
in
the
passage
and
the
delightful
curt
greeting
of
osmond
orgreave
and
his
sleepy
son
jimmie
splendid
powerful
males
she
glanced
at
the
garden
and
at
the
garden
of
the
clayhangers
swimming
in
fresh
sunshine
she
glanced
in
the
mirror
and
saw
the
deshabille
of
her
black
hair
and
of
her
insecure
nightgown
and
thought
truly
i
am
not
so
and
how
well
i
feel
how
fond
they
all
are
of
me
i
just
at
the
right
age
i
young
but
i
mature
i
had
a
lot
of
experience
and
i
not
a
fool
i
strong
i
could
stand
anything
she
put
her
shoulders
back
with
a
challenging
gesture
the
pride
of
life
was
hers
and
then
this
disturbing
vision
of
sarah
gailey
alone
unhappy
unattractive
enfeebled
ageing
ageing
it
seemed
to
her
inexpressibly
cruel
that
people
must
grow
old
and
weak
and
desolate
it
seemed
monstrous
a
pang
momentary
but
excruciating
smote
her
she
said
to
herself
sarah
gailey
has
nothing
to
look
forward
to
except
worry
sarah
gailey
is
at
the
end
instead
of
at
the
beginning
ii
when
she
got
off
the
train
at
turnhill
station
early
that
afternoon
she
had
no
qualm
at
the
thought
of
meeting
george
cannon
she
was
not
even
concerned
to
invent
a
decent
excuse
for
her
silence
in
relation
to
his
urgent
letter
she
went
to
see
him
for
the
sake
of
sarah
gailey
and
because
she
apparently
might
be
of
use
in
some
affair
of
sarah
she
knew
not
what
she
was
proud
that
either
sarah
or
he
thought
that
she
could
be
of
use
or
that
it
was
worth
while
consulting
her
she
had
a
grave
air
as
of
one
to
whom
esteem
has
brought
responsibilities
in
child
street
leading
to
high
street
she
passed
the
office
of
godlimans
the
auctioneers
and
there
among
a
group
of
white
posters
covering
the
large
window
was
a
poster
of
the
sale
of
valuable
household
furniture
and
effects
removed
from
no
lessways
street
and
on
the
poster
in
a
very
black
line
by
itself
stood
out
saliently
the
phrase
massive
bedroom
suite
her
mother
hers
she
had
to
stop
and
read
the
poster
through
though
she
was
curiously
afraid
of
being
caught
in
the
act
all
the
principal
items
were
mentioned
by
the
faithful
auctioneers
and
the
furniture
thus
described
had
a
strange
aspect
of
special
importance
as
if
it
had
been
subtly
better
more
solid
more
desirable
than
any
other
houseful
of
furniture
in
the
town
lessways
furniture
she
sought
for
the
date
the
sale
had
taken
place
on
the
previous
night
at
the
very
hour
when
she
was
lolling
and
laughing
in
the
of
lane
end
house
with
the
orgreaves
the
furniture
was
sold
dispersed
gone
the
house
was
empty
the
past
was
irremediably
closed
the
realization
of
this
naturally
affected
her
raising
phantoms
of
her
mother
and
of
the
face
of
the
as
he
remarked
on
the
drawn
blinds
at
the
cedars
but
she
was
still
more
affected
by
the
thought
that
the
poster
was
on
the
window
and
the
furniture
scattered
solely
because
she
had
willed
it
she
had
said
please
sell
all
the
furniture
and
you
need
consult
me
about
the
sale
i
do
want
to
know
i
prefer
not
to
know
just
get
it
done
and
it
had
been
done
how
mysteriously
romantic
some
girls
would
not
have
sold
the
furniture
would
not
have
dared
to
sell
it
would
have
accepted
the
furniture
and
the
house
as
a
solemn
charge
and
gone
on
living
among
those
relics
obedient
to
a
tradition
but
she
had
dared
she
had
willed
and
the
solid
furniture
had
vanished
away
and
she
was
adventurously
free
she
went
forward
at
the
corner
of
child
street
and
high
street
the
new
town
hall
was
rising
to
the
skies
already
its
walls
were
higher
than
the
highest
house
in
the
vicinity
and
workmen
were
crawling
over
it
amid
dust
and
a
load
of
crimson
bricks
was
trembling
and
revolving
upwards
on
a
thin
rope
that
hung
down
from
the
blue
glimpses
of
london
had
modified
old
estimates
of
her
native
town
nevertheless
the
new
town
hall
still
appeared
extraordinarily
large
and
important
to
her
she
saw
the
detested
arthur
dayson
in
the
distance
of
the
street
and
crossed
hurriedly
to
the
square
looking
fixedly
at
the
storeys
above
the
ironmonger
so
that
arthur
dayson
could
not
possibly
catch
her
eye
there
was
no
sign
of
the
towns
in
the
bare
windows
of
the
second
storey
this
did
not
surprise
her
but
she
was
startled
by
the
absence
of
the
karkeek
from
the
windows
equally
bare
with
those
of
the
second
when
she
got
to
the
entrance
she
was
still
more
startled
to
observe
that
the
karkeek
had
been
removed
she
climbed
the
long
stairs
apprehensively
iii
anybody
here
she
called
out
timidly
she
was
in
the
clerk
office
which
was
empty
but
she
could
hear
movements
in
another
room
the
place
seemed
in
process
of
being
dismantled
suddenly
george
cannon
appeared
in
a
doorway
frowning
good
afternoon
mr
cannon
good
afternoon
miss
lessways
he
spoke
with
stiff
politeness
his
face
looked
weary
after
a
slight
hesitation
he
advanced
and
they
shook
hands
hilda
was
nervous
her
neglect
of
his
letter
now
presented
itself
to
her
as
inexcusable
she
thought
if
he
is
vexed
about
it
i
shall
have
to
humour
him
i
really
ca
blame
him
he
must
think
me
very
queer
i
was
wondering
what
had
become
of
you
he
said
amply
polite
but
not
cordial
well
she
said
every
day
i
was
expecting
you
to
call
again
or
to
send
me
a
note
or
something
and
what
with
one
thing
and
another
i
dare
say
your
time
been
fully
occupied
he
filled
up
her
pause
and
she
fancied
that
he
spoke
in
a
peculiar
tone
she
absurdly
fancied
that
he
was
referring
to
the
time
which
she
had
publicly
spent
with
edwin
clayhanger
at
the
centenary
she
conceived
that
he
might
have
seen
her
and
edwin
clayhanger
together
i
had
a
letter
from
miss
gailey
this
morning
she
said
and
it
seems
that
it
about
her
that
you
wanted
yes
i
do
wish
i
known
if
i
had
the
slightest
idea
i
should
have
come
over
instantly
she
spoke
with
eager
seriousness
and
then
added
smiling
as
if
in
appeal
to
be
favourably
understood
i
thought
it
was
only
about
affairs
sale
or
what
not
and
as
i
asked
you
to
manage
all
these
things
exactly
as
you
thought
best
i
did
trouble
he
laughed
and
either
forgave
or
forgot
will
you
come
this
way
he
invited
in
a
new
tone
of
friendliness
we
rather
in
a
mess
here
you
all
alone
too
she
said
following
him
into
his
room
sowter
out
he
answered
laconically
waiting
for
her
to
precede
him
he
said
nothing
as
to
the
nor
as
to
karkeek
hilda
was
now
sure
that
something
strange
had
happened
so
you
heard
from
sarah
have
you
he
began
when
they
were
both
seated
in
his
own
room
there
were
still
a
lot
of
papers
though
fewer
than
of
old
on
the
broad
desk
but
the
bookcase
was
quite
empty
and
several
of
the
shelves
in
it
had
supped
from
the
horizontal
the
front
part
of
the
shelves
was
a
pale
yellow
and
behind
that
an
irregular
dark
band
of
dust
indicated
the
varying
depths
of
the
vanished
tomes
the
forlornness
of
the
bookcase
gave
a
stricken
air
to
the
whole
room
she
not
well
or
she
imagines
she
not
well
oh
no
said
hilda
warmly
it
is
imagination
she
really
well
you
think
so
i
do
think
i
know
hilda
spoke
proudly
but
with
the
restraint
which
absolute
certainty
permits
she
crushed
rather
than
resented
george
cannon
easy
insinuation
full
of
the
unjustified
superiority
of
the
male
how
could
he
judge
how
could
any
man
judge
she
had
never
before
felt
so
sure
of
herself
so
adult
and
experienced
as
she
felt
then
but
it
nothing
serious
he
suggested
with
deference
n
no
not
what
you
call
serious
said
hilda
judicially
mysteriously
because
she
wants
to
give
up
the
business
altogether
that
all
having
delivered
this
dramatic
blow
george
cannon
smiled
as
it
were
quizzically
and
hilda
was
reassured
about
him
she
had
been
thinking
is
he
ruined
if
he
is
not
ruined
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
puzzling
changes
here
and
she
had
remembered
her
shrewd
hints
and
her
own
later
fears
concerning
the
insecurity
of
his
position
and
had
studied
his
tired
and
worn
face
for
an
equivocal
sign
but
this
smile
and
firm
was
not
the
smile
of
a
ruined
man
and
his
flashing
glance
seemed
to
be
an
omen
of
definite
success
wants
to
give
it
up
exclaimed
hilda
he
nodded
but
why
i
thought
she
was
doing
rather
well
so
she
is
then
why
ah
george
cannon
lifted
his
head
with
a
gesture
signifying
enigma
that
just
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
has
she
said
anything
to
you
as
to
giving
it
up
no
so
it
was
this
that
you
wanted
to
see
me
about
he
nodded
she
wrote
me
a
few
days
after
you
came
away
and
suggested
i
should
see
you
and
ask
you
what
you
thought
but
why
me
well
she
thinks
the
world
of
you
sarah
does
hilda
thought
how
strange
she
did
nothing
but
look
after
me
and
wait
on
me
hand
and
foot
and
i
never
helped
her
in
any
way
and
yet
she
turns
to
me
and
she
was
extremely
flattered
and
gratified
and
was
aware
of
a
delicious
increase
of
but
supposing
she
does
give
it
up
hilda
said
aloud
what
will
she
do
exactly
said
george
cannon
and
then
in
a
very
confidential
ingratiating
manner
i
wish
you
write
to
her
and
put
some
reason
into
her
she
must
give
it
up
with
her
help
and
you
know
in
the
management
she
simply
wonderful
with
her
help
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
bring
something
about
that
startle
folks
only
she
throw
me
over
and
she
must
get
too
crotchety
with
the
boarders
had
some
difficulty
in
that
line
as
it
is
in
fact
i
had
to
be
rather
cross
you
know
about
the
boutwoods
for
instance
well
smoothed
that
over
it
nothing
nothing
if
she
keep
her
head
if
she
keep
her
head
it
a
gold
mine
you
see
only
she
wants
a
bit
of
managing
if
you
write
i
sha
write
said
hilda
i
shall
go
and
see
her
at
once
i
should
have
gone
in
any
case
after
her
letter
this
morning
saying
how
unwell
she
is
she
wants
company
she
was
so
kind
to
me
i
could
possibly
leave
her
in
the
lurch
i
ca
very
well
get
away
but
i
shall
go
and
i
shall
drop
her
a
line
it
very
good
of
you
i
sure
said
george
cannon
obviously
he
was
much
relieved
not
at
all
hilda
protested
she
felt
very
content
and
happy
the
fact
is
he
went
on
there
nobody
but
you
can
do
it
your
mother
was
the
only
real
friend
she
ever
had
and
this
is
the
first
time
she
been
left
alone
up
there
you
see
i
quite
sure
you
can
save
the
situation
he
was
frankly
depending
on
her
for
something
which
he
admitted
he
could
not
accomplish
himself
those
two
people
george
cannon
and
sarah
gailey
had
both
instinctively
turned
to
her
in
a
crisis
none
could
do
what
she
could
do
she
by
the
force
of
her
individuality
could
save
the
situation
she
was
no
longer
a
girl
but
a
mature
and
influential
being
her
ancient
diffidence
before
george
cannon
had
completely
gone
she
had
no
qualms
no
foreboding
no
dubious
sensation
of
weakness
indeed
she
felt
herself
in
one
respect
his
superior
for
his
confidence
in
sarah
gailey
housewifely
skill
his
conviction
that
it
was
unique
and
would
be
irreplaceable
struck
her
as
somewhat
naif
as
being
yet
another
example
of
the
absurd
family
pride
which
she
and
her
mother
had
often
noticed
in
the
five
towns
she
was
not
happy
at
the
prospect
of
so
abruptly
quitting
the
delights
of
lane
end
house
and
the
vicinity
of
edwin
clayhanger
she
was
not
happy
at
the
prospect
of
postponing
the
consideration
of
plans
for
her
own
existence
she
was
not
happy
at
the
prospect
of
sarah
gailey
pessimistic
complainings
she
was
above
happiness
she
was
above
even
that
thrill
of
sharp
and
intense
vitality
which
in
times
past
had
ennobled
trouble
and
misery
she
had
the
most
exquisite
feeling
of
triumphant
she
was
splendidly
conscious
of
power
she
was
indispensable
and
the
dismantled
desolation
of
the
echoing
office
and
the
mystery
of
george
cannon
personal
position
somehow
gave
a
strange
poignancy
to
her
mood
they
talked
of
indifferent
matters
her
property
the
orgreaves
even
the
defunct
newspaper
as
to
which
george
cannon
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
the
conversation
drooped
i
shall
go
up
by
the
four
train
she
said
clinching
the
interview
and
rising
i
may
go
up
by
that
train
myself
said
george
cannon
she
started
oh
are
you
going
to
hornsey
too
no
not
hornsey
i
other
business
chapter
ii
sarah
benefactor
i
on
the
following
afternoon
hilda
travelled
alone
by
the
local
train
from
bleakridge
to
knype
the
central
station
where
all
voyagers
for
london
birmingham
and
manchester
had
to
foregather
in
order
to
take
the
fast
expresses
that
unwillingly
halted
there
and
there
only
in
their
skimming
flights
across
the
district
it
was
a
custom
of
five
towns
hospitality
that
a
departing
guest
should
be
accompanied
as
far
as
knype
and
stowed
with
personal
attentions
into
the
big
train
but
on
this
occasion
hilda
had
wished
otherwise
i
should
nobody
to
go
with
me
to
knype
she
had
said
in
a
characteristic
tone
to
janet
it
was
enough
the
family
had
wondered
but
it
was
enough
the
family
knew
its
singular
its
mysterious
hilda
and
instead
of
at
knype
the
had
occurred
at
the
little
wayside
station
of
bleakridge
with
wavy
moorland
behind
factory
chimneys
in
front
and
cinder
and
shawd
heaps
all
around
hilda
had
told
janet
cannon
may
be
meeting
me
at
knype
he
probably
going
to
london
too
and
the
discreet
janet
comprehending
hilda
had
not
even
mentioned
this
fact
to
the
rest
of
the
family
george
cannon
in
a
light
summer
suit
and
straw
hat
was
already
on
the
platform
at
knype
hilda
had
feared
that
at
bleakridge
he
might
be
looking
out
of
the
window
of
the
local
train
which
started
from
turnhill
she
had
desired
not
to
meet
him
in
the
presence
of
any
of
the
orgreaves
but
either
he
had
caught
the
previous
train
to
knype
or
he
had
driven
down
holding
a
gladstone
bag
and
a
stick
in
one
hand
he
stood
talking
to
another
man
of
about
his
own
age
and
height
the
conversation
was
vivacious
at
any
rate
on
george
cannon
part
hilda
passed
close
by
him
amid
the
populous
stir
of
the
expectant
platform
he
saw
her
turned
and
raised
his
hat
but
in
a
perfunctory
preoccupied
manner
and
instantly
resumed
the
speech
to
his
companion
hilda
recognized
the
latter
it
was
lawton
son
and
successor
to
lawton
the
most
famous
lawyer
in
the
five
towns
young
lawton
had
a
branch
office
at
turnhill
and
lived
in
an
important
house
between
turnhill
and
bursley
where
behind
the
town
hall
was
the
historic
principal
office
of
the
firm
the
express
came
loudly
in
and
hilda
having
climbed
into
a
compartment
leaned
out
from
it
to
descry
her
porter
and
bestow
on
him
a
threepenny
bit
george
cannon
and
young
lawton
were
still
in
argument
and
apparently
quite
indifferent
to
the
train
young
lawton
thin
face
had
its
usual
faint
harsh
smile
his
limbs
were
moveless
in
an
exasperating
and
obstinate
calm
hilda
detested
the
man
from
his
mere
looks
but
george
cannon
was
very
obviously
under
excitement
his
face
was
flushed
he
moved
his
free
arm
violently
even
the
gladstone
bag
swung
to
and
fro
he
punctuated
his
sentences
with
sharp
angry
nods
of
the
head
insisting
and
protesting
and
insisting
while
the
other
saying
much
less
maintained
his
damnable
stupid
disdainful
grin
would
he
let
the
train
go
in
his
feverish
preoccupation
hilda
was
seriously
afraid
that
he
would
the
last
trunks
were
flung
into
the
front
van
the
stationmaster
in
his
tall
hat
waved
curtly
to
the
glittering
guard
the
guard
waved
his
flag
and
whistled
a
porter
banged
the
door
of
hilda
compartment
ignoring
her
gestures
the
engine
whistled
and
at
that
moment
george
cannon
throwing
apparently
a
last
malediction
at
young
lawton
sprang
towards
the
train
and
seeing
hilda
face
rushed
to
the
door
which
she
strained
to
open
again
i
was
afraid
you
be
left
behind
she
said
as
he
dropped
his
bag
on
the
seat
and
the
affronted
stationmaster
himself
shut
the
door
not
quite
ejaculated
cannon
grimly
the
smooth
irresistible
gliding
of
the
train
became
apparent
establishing
a
sudden
aloof
calm
hilda
perceived
that
all
her
muscles
were
tense
in
the
compartment
was
a
couple
what
this
place
asked
the
woman
looks
like
tamworth
said
the
man
sleepily
knype
sir
george
cannon
corrected
him
very
sharply
he
was
so
wrought
up
that
he
had
omitted
even
to
shake
hands
with
hilda
making
no
effort
to
talk
and
showing
no
curiosity
about
hilda
welfare
or
doings
he
moved
uneasily
on
his
seat
and
from
time
to
time
opened
and
shut
the
gladstone
bag
gradually
the
flush
paled
from
his
face
at
lichfield
the
couple
took
advice
from
a
porter
and
stumbled
out
of
the
train
ii
we
fairly
out
of
the
smoke
now
said
hilda
when
the
train
began
to
move
again
as
a
fact
they
had
been
fairly
out
of
the
smoke
of
the
five
towns
for
more
than
half
an
hour
but
hilda
spoke
at
random
timidly
nervously
for
the
sake
of
speaking
and
she
was
as
apologetic
as
though
it
was
she
herself
who
by
some
untimely
discretion
had
annoyed
george
cannon
yes
thank
god
he
replied
fiercely
blowing
with
pleasure
upon
the
embers
of
his
resentment
and
i
take
good
care
i
never
go
into
it
again
to
live
that
is
really
she
murmured
struck
into
an
extreme
astonishment
he
produced
a
cigar
and
a
may
i
he
demanded
carelessly
and
accepted
her
affirmative
as
of
course
you
heard
about
my
little
affair
he
asked
after
lighting
the
cigar
and
he
gazed
at
her
curiously
no
do
you
mean
to
say
that
none
of
the
orgreaves
have
said
anything
this
last
day
or
two
he
leaned
forward
they
were
in
opposite
corners
no
she
repeated
stiffly
nevertheless
she
remembered
a
peculiar
glance
of
tom
to
his
father
on
the
previous
day
when
george
name
had
been
mentioned
well
said
he
you
surprise
me
that
all
but
she
stopped
full
of
misgivings
never
heard
any
gossip
about
me
never
he
persisted
as
it
were
menacing
her
she
shook
her
head
never
heard
that
i
not
really
a
solicitor
oh
well
i
think
mother
once
did
say
something
i
thought
so
but
i
do
understand
those
things
she
said
simply
is
anything
the
matter
is
nothing
he
replied
calm
and
convincing
only
i
been
done
done
you
hear
about
it
some
day
i
dare
say
shall
i
tell
you
would
you
like
me
to
tell
you
he
smiled
rather
boyishly
and
leaned
back
yes
she
nodded
his
attitude
was
very
familiar
recalling
their
former
relation
of
employer
and
employed
it
seemed
as
natural
to
her
as
to
him
that
he
should
not
too
ceremoniously
conceal
his
feelings
or
disguise
his
mood
well
you
see
i
expect
i
know
as
much
about
law
as
any
of
but
i
never
been
admitted
and
so
he
stopped
perceiving
that
she
did
not
comprehend
the
significance
of
such
a
word
as
if
you
want
to
practise
as
a
solicitor
you
have
to
pass
examinations
and
i
never
have
passed
examinations
very
expensive
all
that
and
i
afford
when
i
was
young
it
is
the
exams
that
are
difficult
you
may
tell
that
from
the
fellows
that
pass
them
lawton
for
instance
but
after
a
certain
age
exams
become
a
nuisance
however
i
could
do
everything
else
i
might
have
had
half
a
dozen
situations
as
managing
clerk
in
the
five
towns
if
i
wanted
only
i
did
want
i
wanted
to
be
on
my
own
i
could
get
clients
as
quick
as
any
of
them
quicker
so
i
found
karkeek
the
excellent
karkeek
another
of
the
bright
ones
that
could
pass
the
exams
oh
he
passed
the
exams
all
right
he
spent
five
years
and
i
do
know
how
many
hundred
pounds
in
passing
the
exams
and
with
it
all
he
could
get
above
a
couple
of
pounds
a
week
there
are
hundreds
of
real
solicitors
up
and
down
the
country
who
are
earning
more
and
they
are
worth
more
but
i
gave
him
more
and
a
lot
more
just
to
use
his
name
on
my
door
and
my
blinds
see
in
theory
i
was
his
clerk
but
in
reality
he
was
mine
it
was
all
quite
clear
he
understood
i
should
think
he
did
by
jove
george
cannon
laughed
shortly
every
one
understood
i
got
a
practice
together
in
no
time
did
do
it
he
would
have
got
a
practice
together
in
a
thousand
years
i
had
the
practice
in
turnhill
and
i
should
soon
have
had
the
best
if
i
had
been
done
yes
said
hilda
the
confidence
flattered
her
well
karkeek
came
into
some
money
and
he
simply
walked
out
of
the
office
simply
walked
out
did
give
me
time
to
turn
round
i
always
treated
him
properly
but
he
was
jealous
what
a
shame
hilda
scorn
shrivelled
up
karkeek
there
was
nothing
that
she
detested
so
much
as
a
disloyalty
yes
i
could
stop
him
of
course
no
formal
agreement
between
us
could
be
in
a
case
like
ours
so
he
had
me
he
taken
my
wages
quick
enough
as
long
as
it
suited
him
then
he
comes
into
money
and
behaves
like
that
jealousy
they
were
all
jealous
always
had
been
i
was
doing
too
well
so
i
had
the
whole
gang
down
on
me
instantly
like
a
thousand
of
bricks
they
knew
i
was
helpless
and
so
they
came
on
special
meeting
of
the
committee
of
the
north
staffordshire
law
society
if
you
please
rumours
of
prosecution
oh
yes
i
do
know
what
all
because
i
would
take
the
trouble
to
pass
their
wretched
exams
why
i
could
pass
their
exams
on
my
head
if
i
had
anything
better
to
do
but
i
have
at
first
i
thought
i
retire
for
five
years
and
pass
their
exams
and
then
come
back
and
make
sit
up
and
would
i
have
made
sit
up
but
then
i
said
to
myself
it
is
good
enough
hilda
frowned
what
is
what
the
five
towns
is
good
enough
i
can
find
something
better
than
the
law
and
i
can
find
something
better
than
the
five
towns
and
here
young
lawton
has
the
impudence
to
begin
to
preach
to
me
on
knype
platform
and
to
tell
me
i
wise
in
going
he
the
president
of
the
local
law
society
you
know
no
end
of
a
president
and
has
even
got
gumption
enough
to
keep
his
father
practice
together
stupid
ass
well
i
let
him
have
it
and
straight
he
no
worse
than
the
rest
they
got
no
brains
in
this
district
and
they
so
narrow
narrow
is
the
word
the
word
stupid
mean
mean
what
did
it
matter
to
them
i
kept
to
all
their
rules
there
was
a
real
solicitor
on
the
premises
and
there
soon
have
been
another
if
had
time
no
concern
of
theirs
how
the
money
was
divided
between
me
and
the
real
solicitor
but
they
were
jealous
there
you
are
they
understand
enterprise
they
hate
it
nothing
ever
moves
in
the
five
towns
and
they
got
no
manners
i
do
believe
that
the
worst
look
at
lawton
manners
nothing
but
a
boor
they
are
civilized
yet
that
what
the
matter
with
them
that
what
my
father
used
to
say
barbarians
he
used
to
say
sont
des
barbares
kids
used
to
throw
stones
at
him
because
of
his
the
chuck
a
brick
at
anything
they
do
quite
fancy
that
their
idea
of
wit
hilda
was
afraid
of
his
tempestuous
mood
but
she
enjoyed
her
fear
as
she
might
have
enjoyed
exposure
to
a
dangerous
storm
she
enjoyed
the
sensation
of
her
fragility
and
helplessness
there
cooped
up
with
him
in
the
close
intimacy
of
the
compartment
she
was
glad
that
he
did
not
apologize
to
her
for
his
lack
of
restraint
nor
foolishly
pretend
that
he
was
boring
her
it
does
seem
a
shame
she
murmured
her
eyes
candidly
admitting
that
she
felt
enormously
flattered
he
sighed
and
laughed
how
often
have
i
heard
my
father
say
that
sont
des
peels
only
brought
him
over
because
they
could
find
nobody
in
the
five
towns
civilized
enough
to
do
the
work
that
he
did
i
can
imagine
how
he
must
have
felt
when
he
first
came
here
my
god
environment
i
tell
you
what
it
only
lately
i
realized
how
i
loathe
the
provinces
the
little
interior
in
which
they
were
swept
steadily
and
smoothly
across
the
central
sunlit
plain
of
england
passing
canals
and
brooks
and
cottages
and
churches
silent
and
stolid
in
that
english
stupidity
that
he
was
criticizing
and
hilda
saw
of
george
cannon
all
that
was
french
in
him
she
saw
him
quite
anew
as
something
rather
exotic
and
entirely
marvellous
she
thought
when
i
first
met
him
i
said
to
myself
he
was
a
most
extraordinary
man
and
i
was
right
i
was
more
right
than
i
ever
imagined
no
one
down
there
has
any
idea
of
what
he
really
is
they
too
stupid
as
he
says
he
imposed
on
her
his
scorn
of
the
provincial
she
had
to
share
it
she
had
a
vision
of
the
five
towns
as
a
smoky
blotch
on
the
remote
horizon
negligible
crass
ridiculous
in
its
heavy
the
very
orgreaves
themselves
were
tinged
with
this
odious
english
provincialism
he
smiled
to
himself
and
then
said
very
quietly
it
is
of
the
least
importance
you
know
in
fact
i
rather
glad
i
never
had
any
difficulty
in
making
money
and
when
i
settled
up
everything
down
there
i
sha
be
precisely
without
and
i
shall
have
no
excuse
for
not
branching
out
in
a
new
line
she
meekly
encouraged
him
to
continue
oh
yes
he
went
on
the
law
is
the
only
thing
not
by
a
long
way
and
besides
i
sick
of
it
do
you
know
what
the
great
thing
of
the
future
is
i
mean
the
really
great
thing
the
smashing
big
thing
he
smiled
kindly
and
confidential
she
too
smiled
shaking
her
head
well
i
tell
you
hotels
hotels
she
was
perfectly
nonplussed
hotels
there
be
more
money
and
more
fun
to
be
got
out
of
hotels
soon
than
out
of
any
other
kind
of
enterprise
in
the
world
you
should
see
those
hotels
that
are
going
up
in
london
they
give
you
a
start
and
no
mistake
yes
hotels
there
are
twenty
people
in
england
who
know
what
a
hotel
is
but
i
know
he
paused
and
added
reflectively
in
a
comically
naïve
tone
curious
how
these
things
come
to
you
bit
by
bit
now
if
it
had
been
for
sarah
and
that
he
was
using
his
straw
hat
as
a
fan
with
an
unexpected
and
almost
childlike
gesture
he
suddenly
threw
the
hat
up
on
to
the
rack
above
his
head
how
that
what
a
boy
he
is
after
all
thought
hilda
sympathetically
wondering
why
in
the
midst
of
all
her
manifold
astonishment
she
felt
so
and
gay
funny
parcel
you
got
up
there
he
idly
observed
glancing
from
one
rack
to
the
other
the
parcel
contained
orgreave
generous
conception
of
a
repast
proper
to
be
eaten
in
a
train
in
place
of
high
tea
he
helped
her
to
eat
it
as
the
train
approached
london
he
resumed
his
manhood
and
he
was
impeccably
adult
as
he
conducted
her
from
euston
to
king
cross
and
put
her
into
a
train
in
a
corner
of
the
station
that
the
summer
twilight
had
already
taken
possession
of
iii
late
at
night
hilda
sat
with
sarah
gailey
in
the
landlady
small
bedroom
at
the
cedars
it
was
lighted
by
a
lamp
because
the
builder
of
the
house
hating
excess
had
thought
fit
not
to
carry
higher
than
the
first
floor
a
large
but
old
bedstead
filled
half
the
floor
space
on
the
shabby
a
pile
of
bills
and
various
papers
lay
near
the
lamp
clothes
were
hung
behind
the
door
and
a
vague
wisp
of
muslin
moved
slightly
in
the
warm
draught
from
the
tiny
open
window
there
were
two
small
enamelled
on
which
the
women
sat
close
to
each
other
both
incommoded
by
the
unwholesome
sultriness
of
the
only
chamber
that
could
be
spared
for
the
private
use
of
the
this
small
bedroom
was
sarah
gailey
home
its
amenities
were
the
ultimate
nightly
reward
of
her
labours
if
george
cannon
had
obtained
possession
of
the
cedars
as
an
occupation
for
sarah
this
room
and
sarah
pleasure
therein
were
the
sole
justification
of
the
entire
mansion
as
hilda
looked
at
sarah
gailey
bowed
head
but
little
greyed
beneath
the
ray
of
the
lamp
and
at
her
shrivelled
neurotic
plaintive
face
in
shadow
and
at
her
knotty
hands
loosely
clasped
she
contrasted
her
companion
and
the
scene
with
the
youthfulness
and
the
spaciousness
and
the
sturdy
gay
vigour
of
existence
in
the
household
of
the
orgreaves
she
thought
with
a
renewed
sense
of
the
mysterious
strangeness
of
life
last
night
i
was
there
far
away
all
those
scores
of
miles
of
fields
and
towns
are
between
and
i
am
here
down
there
i
was
nothing
but
an
idler
here
i
am
the
strongest
i
am
indispensable
i
am
the
one
person
on
whom
she
depends
without
me
everything
will
go
to
pieces
and
she
thought
of
george
cannon
vast
enigmatic
projects
concerning
grand
hotels
in
passing
the
immense
pile
of
pancras
on
the
way
from
euston
to
king
cross
george
cannon
had
waved
his
hand
and
said
look
at
that
look
at
that
it
something
after
that
style
that
i
want
for
a
toy
and
i
have
it
yes
the
lofty
turrets
of
pancras
had
not
intimidated
him
he
fresh
from
little
turnhill
and
from
defeats
could
rise
at
once
to
the
height
of
them
and
by
the
force
of
imagination
make
them
his
own
he
could
turn
abruptly
from
the
law
to
hotels
a
disconcerting
man
and
the
mere
tone
in
which
he
mentioned
his
enterprise
seemed
in
a
most
surprising
way
to
dignify
hotels
and
even
to
give
romance
to
the
perfectly
unromantic
business
of
lodging
and
catering
and
the
seed
from
which
he
was
to
grow
the
magic
plant
sat
in
the
room
there
with
hilda
that
bowed
head
the
ambition
and
the
dream
resembled
pancras
the
present
reality
was
the
cedars
and
sarah
poor
stuffy
little
bedroom
in
the
cedars
sarah
began
to
cry
weakly
but
what
the
matter
asked
hilda
the
strong
succourer
nothing
only
it
such
a
relief
to
me
you
come
hilda
deprecated
lightly
i
should
have
come
sooner
if
i
known
you
ought
to
have
sent
word
before
no
i
could
after
all
what
is
it
i
only
silly
there
nothing
really
the
matter
the
minute
you
come
i
can
see
that
i
can
even
stand
those
boutwoods
if
you
here
you
know
george
made
it
up
with
them
and
i
wo
say
he
was
right
but
i
had
to
put
my
pride
in
my
pocket
and
yesterday
it
nearly
made
me
scream
out
to
see
boutwood
stir
her
tea
but
why
i
do
know
it
nerves
that
what
it
is
well
i
got
to
go
through
these
she
fingered
the
papers
on
the
with
her
left
hand
while
drying
her
tears
with
the
right
he
very
wishful
for
proper
accounts
george
is
that
right
enough
but
well
i
think
i
can
make
a
shilling
go
as
far
as
anyone
and
choose
with
anyone
too
that
i
will
say
but
these
accounts
george
is
always
wanting
to
know
how
much
it
costs
a
head
a
week
for
this
that
and
the
other
it
all
very
well
for
him
but
if
he
had
the
servants
to
look
after
and
i
going
to
keep
your
accounts
for
you
hilda
soothed
her
but
i
going
to
keep
your
accounts
for
you
and
she
thought
how
exactly
like
mother
i
was
just
then
it
appeared
to
hilda
that
she
was
making
a
promise
and
shouldering
a
responsibility
against
her
will
and
perhaps
against
her
common
sense
she
might
keep
accounts
at
the
cedars
for
a
week
a
fortnight
a
month
but
she
could
not
keep
accounts
there
indefinitely
she
was
sowing
complications
for
herself
freedom
and
change
and
luxury
were
what
she
deemed
she
desired
not
a
desk
in
a
and
yet
something
within
her
compelled
her
to
say
in
a
firm
sure
kindly
voice
now
give
me
all
those
papers
miss
gailey
and
amid
indefinite
regret
and
foreboding
she
was
proud
and
happy
in
her
rôle
of
benefactor
when
hilda
at
length
rose
to
go
to
her
own
room
sarah
gailey
had
to
move
her
chair
so
that
she
might
pass
at
the
door
both
hesitated
for
an
instant
and
then
hilda
with
a
sudden
gesture
advanced
her
lips
it
was
the
first
time
she
and
sarah
had
ever
kissed
the
contact
with
that
desiccated
skin
intensified
to
an
extraordinary
degree
hilda
emotional
sympathy
for
the
ageing
woman
she
thought
poignantly
poor
old
thing
and
when
she
was
on
the
dark
little
square
landing
under
the
roof
sarah
holding
the
lamp
called
out
in
a
whisper
hilda
well
did
he
say
anything
to
you
about
brighton
brighton
she
perceived
with
certainty
from
sarah
eager
and
yet
apologetic
tone
that
the
question
had
been
waiting
for
utterance
throughout
the
evening
and
that
sarah
had
lacked
courage
for
it
until
the
kiss
had
enheartened
her
and
also
she
perceived
that
sarah
was
suspecting
her
of
being
somehow
in
conspiracy
with
george
cannon
yes
said
sarah
he
got
into
his
head
that
brighton
the
only
place
for
this
business
if
it
to
be
properly
done
he
never
said
a
word
to
me
about
brighton
hilda
whispered
positively
oh
hilda
descended
the
stairs
groping
brighton
what
next
chapter
iii
at
brighton
i
she
thought
vividly
one
afternoon
about
three
months
later
of
that
final
scrap
of
conversation
just
as
she
had
sat
opposite
george
cannon
in
a
compartment
so
now
she
was
sitting
opposite
sarah
gailey
in
a
compartment
the
train
having
passed
lewes
was
within
a
few
minutes
of
brighton
and
following
behind
them
somewhere
at
the
tail
of
the
train
were
certain
trunks
containing
all
that
she
possessed
and
all
that
sarah
gailey
possessed
of
personal
property
their
sole
chattels
and
paraphernalia
on
earth
george
cannon
had
willed
it
and
brought
it
about
he
was
to
receive
them
on
the
platform
of
brighton
station
she
had
not
seen
very
much
of
him
in
the
interval
for
he
had
been
continually
on
the
move
between
brighton
and
turnhill
in
a
moment
we
shall
all
be
together
again
she
reflected
this
meeting
also
will
happen
as
everything
else
has
happened
and
a
new
period
will
definitely
have
begun
and
she
sat
and
stared
at
the
closed
eyes
of
the
desiccated
sarah
gailey
and
waited
for
the
instant
of
arrival
apprehensively
and
as
it
were
incredulously
not
with
fear
not
with
pleasure
but
with
the
foreboding
of
adventure
and
a
curious
idea
that
the
instant
of
arrival
never
would
come
for
thirteen
weeks
which
had
gone
very
quickly
she
had
devoted
herself
to
sarah
gailey
acting
as
george
cannon
precursor
prophet
and
expounder
while
the
summer
cooled
into
autumn
and
the
season
slackened
and
once
more
feebly
brightened
she
had
daily
conversed
with
sarah
about
george
plans
making
them
palatable
to
her
softening
the
shocks
of
them
and
voluntarily
promising
not
to
quit
her
until
the
crisis
was
past
she
had
had
to
discourse
on
the
unique
advantages
of
brighton
as
a
field
for
george
enterprise
and
on
george
common
sense
and
on
sarah
common
sense
and
the
interdependence
of
the
two
when
the
news
came
that
george
had
acquired
down
there
a
house
in
going
order
she
had
had
to
prove
that
it
was
not
the
end
of
the
world
that
was
announced
when
the
news
came
that
george
had
the
cedars
to
its
original
occupier
she
had
had
to
prove
that
the
transaction
did
not
signify
a
mysterious
but
mortal
insult
to
sarah
when
the
news
came
that
the
cedars
must
be
vacated
before
noon
on
a
given
saturday
she
had
had
to
begin
all
her
demonstrations
afresh
and
in
addition
attempt
to
persuade
sarah
that
george
was
not
utterly
mad
buying
and
selling
tenancies
all
over
the
south
of
england
and
that
the
exit
from
the
cedars
would
not
be
the
ruin
of
dignity
and
peace
and
the
commencement
of
fatal
disasters
in
the
hour
when
sarah
gailey
learnt
the
immutable
saturday
of
departure
the
cedars
which
had
been
her
hell
promised
to
become
on
that
very
saturday
a
paradise
on
the
whole
the
three
months
had
constituted
a
quarter
of
exceeding
difficulty
and
delicacy
the
first
month
had
been
rendered
memorable
by
sarah
astonishing
behaviour
when
hilda
had
desired
to
pay
as
before
for
her
board
and
lodging
the
mere
offer
of
the
money
had
made
plain
to
sarah
what
she
then
said
she
had
always
suspected
that
hilda
was
her
enemy
in
disguise
and
like
the
rest
bent
on
humiliating
her
and
outraging
her
most
sacred
feelings
in
that
encounter
but
in
no
other
sarah
had
won
the
opportune
withdrawal
of
the
boutwoods
from
the
had
assisted
the
establishment
of
peace
when
the
boutwoods
left
miss
gailey
seemed
to
breathe
the
air
as
though
it
were
ozone
of
the
mountains
but
her
joy
had
been
quickly
dissipated
for
to
dissipate
joy
was
her
chief
recreation
a
fortnight
before
the
migration
to
brighton
hilda
contemplating
all
that
had
to
be
done
had
thought
aghast
i
shall
never
he
able
to
humour
her
into
doing
it
all
closing
of
accounts
dismissals
inventories
bills
receipts
packing
decision
concerning
trains
reception
of
the
former
proprietor
especially
that
superintending
the
stowage
of
luggage
on
the
cab
george
cannon
had
not
once
appeared
in
the
last
sensitive
weeks
and
he
had
therein
been
wise
and
all
that
had
to
be
done
had
been
done
not
by
hilda
but
by
sarah
gailey
the
touchy
and
the
competent
hilda
had
done
little
but
the
humouring
ii
and
there
sat
sarah
gailey
deracinated
and
captive
to
prove
how
influential
a
person
hilda
was
with
the
eyes
shut
sarah
worn
face
under
her
black
bonnet
had
precisely
the
aspect
of
a
corpse
and
the
corpse
of
somebody
who
had
expired
under
the
weight
of
all
the
woe
hilda
thought
when
she
is
dead
she
will
look
just
like
that
and
one
day
sooner
or
later
she
will
be
dead
strange
that
sarah
gailey
with
no
malady
except
her
chronic
rheumatism
and
no
material
anxiety
and
every
prospect
of
security
in
old
age
could
not
be
content
could
not
at
any
rate
refrain
from
being
miserable
but
she
could
not
she
was
an
exhaustless
fount
of
worry
and
misery
i
suppose
i
like
her
thought
hilda
but
why
do
i
like
her
she
is
agreeable
she
is
amusing
she
is
pretty
she
is
even
kind
now
only
depressing
and
tedious
as
soon
as
she
fixed
up
here
i
shall
go
i
shall
leave
her
i
done
enough
and
i
had
enough
i
must
attend
to
my
own
affairs
a
bit
after
all
and
then
hilda
conscience
interrupted
but
can
you
leave
her
altogether
without
you
what
will
happen
to
her
she
getting
older
and
worse
every
day
perhaps
in
a
few
years
she
wo
even
be
competent
already
she
is
perhaps
quite
quite
as
competent
as
she
was
and
hilda
said
well
of
course
i
shall
have
to
keep
an
eye
on
her
come
and
see
her
sometimes
often
and
she
knew
that
as
long
as
they
both
lived
she
could
never
be
free
from
a
sense
of
responsibility
towards
sarah
gailey
useless
to
argue
it
george
cannon
affair
not
mine
useless
to
ask
should
i
feel
responsible
only
after
she
had
laid
sarah
gailey
in
the
tomb
would
she
be
free
and
that
day
too
will
come
she
thought
again
i
shall
have
to
go
through
it
and
i
shall
go
through
it
the
poignant
romance
of
existence
enveloped
her
in
its
beautiful
veils
and
through
these
veils
she
saw
vague
and
diminished
the
far
vista
of
the
hours
which
she
had
spent
with
the
orgreaves
she
saw
the
night
of
edwin
clayhanger
visit
and
herself
and
him
together
in
the
porch
and
she
remembered
the
shock
of
his
words
there
no
virtue
in
believing
the
vision
was
like
that
of
another
and
quite
separate
life
would
she
ever
go
back
to
it
janet
was
her
friend
in
theory
her
one
intimate
friend
she
had
seen
her
once
in
london
beautiful
agreeable
affectionate
intelligent
all
the
orgreaves
were
lovable
the
glance
of
edwin
clayhanger
and
the
sincerity
of
his
smile
had
affected
her
in
a
manner
absolutely
unique
but
would
she
ever
go
back
it
seemed
to
her
fantastic
impossible
that
she
should
ever
go
back
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
netted
by
destiny
in
any
case
she
knew
that
she
could
not
meanwhile
give
to
that
group
in
bursley
even
a
part
of
herself
hilda
could
never
give
a
part
of
herself
moreover
she
was
a
bad
and
so
if
among
themselves
the
group
at
bursley
charged
her
with
inconstancy
she
must
accept
the
accusation
to
which
she
was
inevitably
exposed
by
the
very
ardour
of
her
temperament
the
of
brakes
took
her
unawares
the
train
was
in
brighton
sliding
over
the
outskirts
of
the
town
miss
gailey
opened
her
apprehensive
eyes
hilda
saw
steep
streets
of
houses
that
sprawled
on
the
hilly
mounds
of
the
great
town
like
ladders
reminiscent
of
certain
streets
of
her
native
district
yet
quite
different
a
physiognomy
utterly
foreign
to
her
this
then
was
brighton
that
which
had
been
a
postmark
became
suddenly
a
reality
shattering
her
preconceptions
of
it
and
disappointing
her
she
knew
not
why
she
glanced
forward
through
the
window
and
saw
the
cavern
of
the
station
in
a
few
seconds
they
would
have
arrived
and
her
formal
mission
would
be
over
she
was
very
agitated
and
very
nervous
george
cannon
had
promised
to
meet
them
would
he
meet
them
the
next
instant
she
saw
the
platform
she
saw
george
cannon
conspicuous
and
debonair
in
a
new
suit
swinging
his
ebony
stick
the
train
stopped
he
descried
them
there
he
is
she
said
bravely
pretending
to
be
gay
and
she
thought
i
could
not
believe
that
this
moment
would
come
but
it
has
come
she
had
anticipated
relief
from
this
moment
but
she
was
aware
of
no
relief
on
the
contrary
she
felt
most
uncomfortably
apologetic
to
sarah
gailey
for
george
cannon
and
to
george
cannon
for
sarah
gailey
she
had
the
constraint
of
a
sinner
and
by
the
side
of
george
cannon
on
the
platform
she
was
aware
of
her
shabbiness
and
of
her
girlish
fragility
nevertheless
she
put
her
shoulders
back
with
a
gesture
like
his
own
thinking
proudly
and
trying
to
make
her
eyes
speak
well
here
is
sarah
gailey
thanks
to
me
as
sarah
greeted
him
hilda
observed
with
some
dismay
a
curious
very
slight
stiffening
of
her
demeanour
familiar
phenomenon
which
denoted
that
sarah
was
in
the
grip
of
a
secret
grievance
poor
old
thing
she
thought
ruefully
i
imagined
she
forgiven
him
for
bringing
her
here
but
she
has
iii
they
drove
down
from
the
station
in
an
open
carriage
unencumbered
by
the
trunks
which
george
cannon
had
separately
disposed
of
he
sat
with
his
back
to
the
horse
opposite
the
two
women
and
talked
at
intervals
about
the
weather
the
prospects
of
the
season
and
the
town
his
familiarity
with
the
town
was
apparently
such
that
he
seemed
to
be
a
native
of
it
and
even
in
some
mysterious
way
to
have
assisted
in
its
creation
and
development
so
that
he
took
pride
in
its
qualities
and
accepted
responsibility
for
its
defects
when
he
ceremoniously
saluted
two
women
who
went
by
in
another
carriage
hilda
felt
sharply
the
inferiority
of
an
ignorant
stranger
in
presence
of
one
for
whom
the
place
had
no
secrets
her
first
disappointment
changed
slowly
into
expectant
and
hopeful
curiosity
the
quaint
irregularities
of
the
architecture
and
the
vastness
of
the
thronged
perspectives
made
promises
to
her
romantic
sense
the
town
seemed
to
be
endless
as
london
there
were
hotels
churches
chapels
libraries
and
on
every
hand
the
more
ordinary
features
of
main
streets
the
marts
of
jewellery
drapery
and
tobacco
had
an
air
of
grandiose
respectability
while
the
narrow
alleys
that
curved
enigmatically
away
between
the
lofty
buildings
of
these
fine
thoroughfares
beckoned
darkly
to
the
fancy
the
multiplicity
of
beggars
louts
and
was
alone
a
proof
of
brighton
success
in
the
world
the
often
a
man
and
a
woman
yoked
together
were
extraordinarily
english
genteel
and
prosperous
as
they
trudged
in
their
neat
raiment
through
the
gritty
mud
of
the
macadam
stolidly
ignoring
the
menace
of
horses
and
disdainful
glittering
wheels
brighton
was
evidently
a
city
apart
nevertheless
hilda
did
not
as
yet
understand
why
george
cannon
should
have
considered
it
to
be
the
sole
field
worthy
of
his
enterprise
then
the
carriage
rounded
into
king
road
and
suddenly
she
saw
the
incredible
frontage
of
hotels
and
and
apartments
and
she
saw
the
broad
and
boundless
promenade
alive
with
all
its
processions
of
pleasure
and
she
saw
the
ocean
and
everything
that
she
had
seen
up
to
that
moment
fell
to
the
insignificance
of
a
background
she
understood
after
a
blusterous
but
mild
autumn
day
the
scarlet
sun
was
setting
calmly
between
a
saffron
sky
and
saffron
water
it
flashed
upon
waves
and
sails
and
flags
and
upon
the
puddles
in
the
road
and
upon
and
flowered
balconies
giving
glory
to
human
pride
the
carriage
merged
in
a
phalanx
of
carriages
rolled
past
innumerable
splendid
houses
and
every
house
without
exception
was
a
hostel
and
an
invitation
some
were
higher
than
any
she
had
ever
seen
and
one
terrific
building
in
course
of
construction
had
already
far
overtopped
the
highest
of
its
neighbours
she
glanced
at
george
cannon
who
by
a
carefully
casual
demeanour
was
trying
not
to
take
the
credit
of
the
entire
spectacle
and
she
admitted
that
he
was
indeed
wonderful
of
course
sarah
he
said
as
the
carriage
shortly
afterwards
turned
up
preston
street
where
the
dying
wind
roughly
caught
them
we
beginning
with
anything
as
big
as
all
that
so
you
need
shiver
in
your
shoes
you
know
what
my
notion
is
he
included
hilda
in
his
address
my
notion
is
to
get
some
experience
first
in
a
smaller
house
we
must
pay
for
our
experience
and
my
notion
is
to
pay
as
little
as
possible
i
can
tell
you
there
quite
a
lot
of
things
that
have
to
be
picked
up
before
you
got
the
hang
of
a
town
like
this
quite
a
lot
sarah
grimly
nodded
she
had
scarcely
spoken
we
beginning
rather
well
i
told
you
all
about
the
watchett
sisters
have
i
they
an
income
a
positive
income
and
then
boutwood
and
his
wife
have
decided
to
come
did
i
tell
you
bou
the
syllable
escaped
explosively
from
sarah
gailey
mouth
overcoming
her
stern
guard
instantly
by
a
tremendous
effort
she
checked
the
flow
but
the
violent
shock
of
the
news
had
convulsed
her
whole
being
the
look
on
her
face
was
changed
to
desperation
hilda
trembled
and
even
the
splendid
and
george
cannon
was
discountenanced
not
till
then
had
hilda
realized
with
what
intense
bitterness
the
souvenir
of
the
boutwoods
festered
in
sarah
gailey
unreasoning
heart
iv
here
we
are
said
george
cannon
jauntily
as
the
carriage
stopped
in
front
of
no
preston
street
but
his
jauntiness
seemed
factitious
the
demeanour
of
all
three
was
diffident
and
unnatural
for
now
had
arrived
the
moment
when
george
cannon
had
to
submit
his
going
concern
to
the
ordeal
of
inspection
by
the
women
and
especially
by
sarah
gailey
there
the
house
stood
a
physical
fact
forcing
george
to
justify
it
and
beseeching
clemency
from
the
two
women
the
occasion
was
critical
therefore
everybody
had
to
pretend
that
it
was
a
perfectly
ordinary
occasion
well
knowing
the
futility
of
the
pretence
and
the
inevitable
constraint
was
acutely
aggravated
by
sarah
silent
and
terrible
reception
of
the
news
concerning
the
boutwoods
while
george
cannon
was
paying
the
driver
sarah
and
hilda
hesitated
awkwardly
on
the
pavement
their
hands
occupied
with
small
belongings
they
had
the
sensation
of
being
foreigners
to
the
house
they
could
not
even
mount
the
steps
without
his
protection
scarcely
might
they
in
decency
examine
the
frontage
of
the
house
they
could
not
however
avoid
seeing
that
a
workman
was
fixing
a
new
and
splendid
at
the
entrance
and
that
this
plate
bore
the
words
cannon
house
hilda
thought
startled
at
last
he
is
using
his
own
name
he
turned
to
them
you
have
a
view
of
the
sea
from
the
of
the
on
the
first
floor
he
remarked
neither
hilda
nor
sarah
responded
and
of
course
from
the
other
higher
up
he
added
almost
pitifully
in
his
careful
casualness
hilda
felt
sorry
for
him
and
she
could
not
understand
why
she
felt
sorry
why
it
seemed
a
shame
that
he
should
be
mysteriously
compelled
thus
to
defend
the
house
before
it
had
been
attacked
oh
yes
she
murmured
foolishly
almost
fatuously
the
street
and
the
house
were
disappointing
after
the
grandeur
of
the
promenade
the
street
appeared
shabby
and
it
had
the
characteristics
of
a
side
street
it
was
the
retreat
of
those
who
could
not
afford
anything
better
and
its
base
inhabitants
walked
out
on
to
the
promenade
and
swaggeringly
feigned
to
be
the
equals
of
their
superiors
the
house
also
was
shabby
and
with
its
poor
little
glimpse
of
the
sea
although
larger
than
the
cedars
it
was
noticeably
smaller
and
meaner
than
any
house
on
the
promenade
and
whereas
the
cedars
was
detached
no
was
not
even
but
one
of
a
gaunt
tall
row
of
stuccoed
and
dwellings
it
looked
like
a
which
the
cedars
did
not
and
not
all
the
style
of
george
cannon
suit
and
cane
and
manner
as
he
mounted
the
steps
nor
the
polish
of
his
new
could
redeem
it
from
the
disgrace
of
being
a
very
ordinary
george
cannon
had
made
a
serious
mistake
in
bringing
the
carriage
round
by
the
promenade
true
he
had
exhibited
the
glory
of
brighton
but
he
had
done
so
to
the
detriment
of
his
new
enterprise
that
no
ought
to
be
regarded
as
merely
an
inexpensive
field
for
the
acquiring
of
preliminary
experience
did
not
influence
the
judgment
of
the
women
in
the
slightest
degree
for
them
it
was
a
house
that
rightly
apologized
for
itself
and
whose
apologetic
air
deserved
only
a
condescending
tolerance
the
front
door
stood
open
for
the
convenience
of
the
artisan
who
was
screwing
at
the
he
moved
aside
with
the
servility
that
always
characterizes
the
worker
in
a
city
of
idlers
and
the
party
passed
into
a
long
narrow
hall
whose
walls
were
papered
to
imitate
impossible
blocks
of
marble
the
party
was
now
at
home
here
we
are
said
hilda
with
a
gaiety
that
absolutely
desolated
herself
and
in
the
same
instant
she
remembered
that
george
cannon
had
preceded
her
in
saying
we
are
she
looked
from
the
awful
glumness
of
sarah
gailey
to
the
equally
awful
alacrity
of
george
cannon
and
felt
as
though
she
had
committed
some
crime
whose
nature
she
could
not
guess
a
maid
appeared
like
a
suspicious
scout
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
beyond
the
stairs
having
opened
a
door
which
showed
a
glimpse
of
a
kitchen
that
tea
ready
asked
george
cannon
no
sir
said
the
maid
plumply
well
let
it
be
got
ready
yes
sir
the
maid
vanished
flouncing
sarah
gailey
with
a
heavy
sigh
dropped
her
small
belongings
on
to
a
narrow
bare
table
that
stood
against
the
wall
near
the
foot
of
the
stairs
daylight
was
fading
well
said
george
cannon
balancing
his
hat
on
his
cane
your
luggage
will
be
here
directly
this
is
the
he
pushed
at
a
door
the
women
followed
him
into
the
and
stared
at
the
room
in
silence
there
a
bedroom
behind
he
said
as
they
came
out
and
he
displayed
the
bedroom
behind
that
the
kitchen
he
pointed
to
the
adjoining
door
the
larger
he
said
it
includes
the
width
of
the
hall
they
climbed
the
narrow
stairs
after
him
wearily
the
door
of
the
was
ajar
and
the
chatter
of
thin
feminine
voices
could
be
heard
within
george
cannon
gave
a
soundless
warning
whisper
the
watchetts
and
sarah
gailey
frowned
back
the
information
that
she
did
not
wish
to
meet
the
watchetts
just
then
with
every
precaution
against
noise
george
cannon
opened
two
other
doors
showing
bedrooms
and
then
as
it
were
hypnotized
by
him
the
women
climbed
another
flight
of
narrow
stairs
darkening
and
saw
more
rooms
and
then
still
another
flight
and
still
more
rooms
and
finally
the
boasted
view
of
the
sea
after
all
hilda
was
obliged
to
admit
to
herself
that
the
house
was
more
impressive
than
she
had
at
first
supposed
although
it
was
deep
and
there
were
two
bedrooms
on
the
first
floor
and
four
each
two
large
and
two
small
on
the
second
and
third
eleven
in
all
they
had
seen
of
which
three
were
occupied
by
the
watchetts
and
one
temporarily
by
george
cannon
the
rest
were
empty
but
the
season
had
scarcely
begun
and
the
boutwoods
were
coming
george
cannon
had
said
grandly
that
hilda
must
choose
her
room
she
chose
the
smallest
on
the
top
floor
the
furniture
if
shabby
and
was
everywhere
ample
they
descended
and
not
a
word
had
been
said
about
sarah
room
on
the
landing
where
indeed
the
danger
was
acutest
they
were
trapped
by
two
of
the
watchetts
these
elderly
ladies
shot
almost
roguishly
out
of
the
and
by
their
smiles
struck
the
descending
party
into
immobility
oh
we
saw
you
arrive
mr
cannon
said
the
elder
shaking
her
head
so
this
is
miss
gailey
good
afternoon
miss
gailey
so
pleased
to
make
your
acquaintance
there
was
handshaking
then
it
was
hilda
turn
we
so
sorry
our
eldest
sister
is
here
to
welcome
you
to
no
said
the
younger
she
had
to
go
to
london
for
the
day
we
very
fond
of
no
there
no
place
quite
like
it
to
our
minds
and
quite
sure
we
shall
be
quite
as
comfortable
with
dear
miss
gailey
as
we
were
with
dear
granville
poor
thing
it
was
quite
a
wrench
when
we
had
to
say
to
her
last
night
do
come
into
the
please
there
a
beautiful
view
of
the
sea
sarah
gailey
hesitated
a
noise
of
bumping
came
from
the
hall
below
i
think
that
the
luggage
she
said
the
smile
with
which
she
forced
herself
to
respond
to
the
fixed
simper
of
the
watchetts
seemed
to
cause
her
horrible
torment
she
motioned
nervously
to
george
cannon
who
was
nearest
the
stairs
a
little
later
then
a
little
later
then
said
both
the
watchetts
bowing
the
party
away
with
the
most
singular
grimaces
in
the
hall
a
lad
perspiring
and
breathing
quickly
stood
behind
the
trunks
wait
a
moment
george
cannon
said
to
him
and
murmured
to
sarah
this
is
the
basement
here
the
maid
appeared
at
the
kitchen
door
with
a
large
loaded
tray
come
along
with
that
tea
louisa
he
added
pleasantly
he
went
first
sarah
next
and
hilda
last
cautiously
down
a
short
dark
flight
of
stone
steps
beneath
the
stairs
the
servant
followed
at
the
foot
a
burned
those
watchetts
might
be
the
landladies
muttered
sarah
strangely
ignoring
the
propinquity
of
the
maid
and
sniffed
hilda
gave
a
short
uneasy
laugh
she
had
a
desire
to
laugh
loudly
and
wildly
and
by
so
doing
to
snap
the
nervous
tension
which
seemed
to
grow
tighter
and
tighter
every
minute
her
wretchedness
had
become
so
exquisite
that
she
could
begin
to
enjoy
it
to
savour
it
like
a
pleasure
and
she
thought
with
conscious
and
satisfied
grimness
so
this
is
brighton
chapter
iv
the
sea
i
in
the
evening
hilda
returning
from
a
short
solitary
walk
as
far
as
the
west
pier
found
sarah
gailey
stooping
over
her
open
trunks
in
the
bedroom
which
had
been
assigned
to
her
there
were
two
quite
excellent
though
rooms
of
which
this
was
one
in
the
basement
the
other
was
to
be
used
as
a
private
parlour
by
the
managers
of
the
house
at
night
with
the
gas
lighted
and
the
yellow
blind
drawn
and
the
loose
bundle
of
strips
paper
gleaming
in
the
grate
the
bedroom
seemed
very
cozy
and
habitable
in
its
shabbiness
like
the
rest
of
the
house
it
had
an
ample
supply
of
furniture
and
especially
of
those
trifling
articles
useful
or
useless
which
collect
only
by
slow
degrees
and
which
are
a
proof
of
long
humanizing
habitation
in
that
room
sarah
gailey
was
indeed
merely
the
successor
of
the
regretted
granville
the
landlady
who
had
mysteriously
receded
into
the
unknown
before
the
advent
of
sarah
and
hilda
but
with
whom
george
cannon
must
have
had
many
interviews
no
doubt
the
room
was
an
epitome
of
the
character
of
granville
presumably
a
fussy
and
precise
celibate
with
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
and
an
indiscriminating
tendency
to
hoard
sarah
gailey
was
at
that
stage
of
unpacking
when
trunks
being
nearly
empty
and
drawers
having
scarcely
begun
to
fill
bed
table
and
chairs
are
encumbered
with
confused
masses
of
goods
apparently
far
exceeding
the
cubical
contents
of
the
trunks
can
i
do
anything
for
you
asked
hilda
the
new
landlady
raised
her
watery
and
dejected
eyes
if
you
mind
taking
every
single
one
of
those
off
the
mantelpiece
and
putting
them
away
on
the
top
shelf
of
the
cupboard
hilda
smiled
it
a
bit
crowded
is
it
crowded
by
her
intonation
of
this
one
word
sarah
gailey
condemned
granville
whole
life
can
i
empty
this
chair
i
shall
want
something
to
stand
on
said
hilda
better
see
if
the
shelf
dusty
sarah
gloomily
warned
her
well
murmured
hilda
on
the
chair
if
my
feather
does
actually
touch
the
ceiling
sarah
gailey
made
no
response
to
this
and
hilda
with
her
hands
full
of
vain
gewgaws
tried
again
i
wonder
what
granville
would
say
if
she
saw
me
my
word
it
quite
hot
up
here
a
resonant
very
amiable
voice
came
from
beyond
the
door
is
she
there
who
demanded
sarah
grievous
miss
lessways
it
was
george
cannon
yes
i
just
want
to
speak
to
her
if
she
at
liberty
said
george
cannon
hilda
cried
from
the
ceiling
i
come
as
soon
as
i
please
go
now
sarah
interrupted
in
tense
accents
hilda
glanced
down
at
her
astonished
and
saw
in
her
eyes
an
almost
childish
appeal
weak
and
passionate
which
gripped
the
heart
painfully
she
jumped
from
the
chair
sarah
gailey
was
now
sitting
on
the
bed
yes
in
her
worn
face
of
a
woman
who
has
definitely
passed
the
climacteric
and
in
the
abandoned
pose
of
those
thin
arms
there
was
the
look
and
gesture
of
a
young
girl
desperately
beseeching
hilda
was
puzzled
and
intimidated
she
had
meant
to
be
jocular
and
to
insist
on
staying
till
the
task
was
finished
but
she
kept
silence
and
obeyed
the
supplication
from
a
motive
of
prudence
i
would
keep
you
from
him
for
anything
murmured
sarah
gailey
tragically
as
hilda
opened
the
door
and
left
her
sitting
forlorn
among
all
her
skirts
and
linen
ii
i
here
george
cannon
called
out
from
the
parlour
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
door
he
was
looking
from
the
window
up
at
the
street
the
blind
had
not
been
drawn
he
turned
as
hilda
entered
you
been
out
he
said
observing
that
she
was
in
street
attire
what
is
it
she
asked
nervously
fearing
that
some
altercation
had
already
occurred
between
brother
and
sister
it
about
your
private
affairs
that
all
he
said
easily
and
if
you
just
come
in
oh
she
smiled
her
relief
but
nevertheless
she
was
still
preoccupied
by
the
image
of
the
woman
in
the
next
room
they
been
dragging
on
quite
long
enough
said
george
cannon
as
he
stooped
to
poke
the
morsel
of
fire
in
the
grate
which
had
a
hob
on
either
side
on
one
of
these
hobs
was
a
glass
of
milk
hilda
had
learnt
that
day
for
the
first
time
that
at
a
certain
hour
every
evening
george
cannon
drank
a
glass
of
warm
milk
and
that
this
glass
of
warm
milk
was
an
important
factor
in
his
daily
comfort
he
now
took
the
glass
and
drank
it
off
and
hilda
had
a
peculiar
sensation
of
being
more
intimate
with
him
than
she
had
ever
been
before
they
sat
down
to
the
square
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
crowded
with
oddments
of
furniture
including
a
desk
which
george
cannon
had
appropriated
to
his
own
exclusive
use
this
desk
was
open
and
a
portion
of
its
contents
were
spread
abroad
on
the
crimson
cloth
of
the
table
among
them
hilda
noticed
with
her
accustomed
clerkly
eye
two
numbers
of
and
several
sheets
of
and
a
document
with
the
heading
inventory
of
furniture
at
no
preston
street
also
a
large
legal
envelope
inscribed
lessways
estate
from
the
latter
george
cannon
drew
forth
an
engraved
and
flourished
paper
which
he
silently
placed
in
front
of
her
it
was
a
receipt
signed
by
the
manager
of
the
brighton
branch
of
the
southern
counties
bank
for
the
sum
of
three
thousand
four
hundred
and
pounds
deposited
at
call
by
miss
hilda
lessways
everything
is
now
settled
up
he
said
here
are
all
the
figures
and
he
handed
her
another
paper
showing
the
whole
of
the
figures
for
the
realization
of
her
real
property
and
of
her
furniture
it
in
your
name
and
nobody
can
touch
it
but
you
she
glanced
at
the
figures
vaguely
not
attempting
to
comprehend
them
as
for
the
receipt
it
fascinated
her
the
fragile
scrap
represented
her
livelihood
her
future
her
salvation
it
alone
stood
between
her
and
unimagined
terrors
and
she
was
surprised
to
see
it
surprised
by
its
assurance
that
no
accident
had
happened
to
her
possessions
during
the
process
of
transformation
carried
out
by
george
cannon
for
though
he
had
throughout
been
almost
worryingly
meticulous
in
his
business
formalities
and
his
promptitudes
never
had
any
interest
or
rent
been
a
day
late
she
admitted
to
herself
now
that
she
had
been
afraid
that
in
fact
she
had
not
utterly
trusted
him
and
what
got
to
be
done
with
this
she
asked
simply
fingering
the
receipt
he
smiled
at
her
with
a
touch
of
protective
and
yet
sardonic
condescension
without
saying
a
word
and
suddenly
it
struck
her
that
ages
had
elapsed
since
her
first
interview
with
him
in
the
office
over
the
ironmonger
at
turnhill
and
that
both
of
them
were
extraordinarily
changed
she
was
reminded
of
that
interview
not
by
his
face
and
look
nor
by
their
relative
positions
at
the
table
but
by
a
very
faint
odour
of
for
at
turnhill
also
a
had
been
between
them
after
an
interval
of
anxiety
and
depression
he
had
regained
exactly
the
triumphant
air
which
was
her
earliest
recollection
of
him
he
was
not
appreciably
older
but
for
her
he
was
no
longer
the
same
man
because
she
saw
him
differently
knowing
much
more
of
him
she
read
in
his
features
a
thousand
minor
significances
to
which
before
she
had
been
blind
the
dominating
impression
was
not
now
the
impression
of
his
masculinity
there
was
no
clearly
dominating
impression
he
had
lost
for
her
the
romantic
allurement
of
the
strange
and
the
unknown
still
she
liked
and
admired
him
and
she
felt
an
awe
which
was
agreeable
to
her
of
his
tremendous
enterprise
and
his
obstinate
volition
that
faculty
which
he
possessed
of
uprooting
himself
and
uprooting
others
put
her
in
fear
of
him
he
had
willed
to
be
established
as
a
caterer
in
brighton
he
who
but
yesterday
as
it
seemed
was
a
lawyer
in
turnhill
and
on
this
very
night
he
was
established
in
brighton
and
his
sister
with
him
and
she
with
his
sister
the
enormous
affair
had
been
accomplished
this
thought
had
been
obsessing
hilda
all
the
afternoon
and
evening
when
she
reflected
upon
the
change
in
herself
the
untravelled
hilda
of
turnhill
appeared
a
stranger
to
her
and
a
simpleton
no
more
as
george
cannon
offered
no
answer
to
her
question
she
said
i
suppose
it
will
have
to
be
invested
all
this
he
nodded
well
considering
it
only
been
bringing
in
one
per
cent
per
annum
for
the
last
week
of
course
i
need
have
put
it
on
deposit
but
i
always
prefer
that
way
it
more
satisfactory
hilda
could
hear
faintly
through
the
thin
wooden
partition
the
movements
of
sarah
gailey
in
the
next
room
and
the
image
of
the
mournful
woman
returned
to
disquiet
her
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
that
hysteric
appeal
and
glance
then
she
heard
the
door
of
the
bedroom
open
violently
and
the
figure
of
sarah
gailey
passed
like
a
flash
across
the
doorway
of
the
parlour
and
the
footsteps
of
sarah
gailey
pattered
up
the
stone
stairs
and
the
front
door
banged
and
the
skirts
and
feet
of
sarah
gailey
intercepted
for
an
instant
the
light
of
the
that
shone
on
the
of
the
parlour
excuse
me
a
minute
muttered
hilda
frowning
by
one
of
her
swift
and
unreflecting
impulses
she
abandoned
george
cannon
and
her
private
affairs
and
scurried
by
the
area
steps
into
the
street
iii
bareheaded
and
with
no
jacket
or
mantle
sarah
gailey
was
walking
quickly
down
preston
street
towards
the
promenade
and
hilda
afraid
but
courageous
followed
her
at
a
distance
of
thirty
or
forty
yards
hilda
could
not
decide
why
she
was
afraid
nor
why
it
should
be
necessary
in
so
simple
an
undertaking
as
a
walk
down
preston
street
to
call
upon
her
courage
assuming
even
that
sarah
gailey
turned
round
and
caught
her
what
then
the
consequences
could
not
be
very
terrible
but
sarah
gailey
did
not
turn
round
she
went
straight
forward
as
though
on
a
definite
errand
in
a
town
with
which
she
was
perfectly
familiar
and
having
arrived
at
the
corner
of
preston
street
and
the
promenade
unhesitatingly
crossed
the
muddy
roadway
of
the
promenade
and
after
a
moment
halt
vanished
down
the
steps
in
the
to
the
of
the
pier
the
pier
a
double
rope
of
twinkling
lamps
hung
magically
over
the
invisible
sea
and
at
the
end
of
it
constant
and
grave
a
red
globe
burned
menacingly
in
the
waste
of
the
night
and
hilda
thought
as
she
hastened
with
gathering
terror
across
the
promenade
out
there
at
the
end
of
the
pier
the
water
is
splashing
and
beating
against
the
piles
she
stopped
at
the
parapet
of
the
and
looked
behind
her
like
a
thief
the
entrance
to
the
pier
was
highly
illuminated
but
except
for
a
man
head
and
shoulders
caged
in
the
of
the
turnstile
there
was
no
life
there
the
man
seemed
to
be
waiting
solitary
with
everlasting
patience
in
the
web
of
wavering
flame
beneath
the
huge
dark
sky
scores
of
posters
large
and
small
showed
that
robertson
school
was
being
performed
in
the
theatre
away
over
the
sea
at
the
extremity
of
the
pier
the
promenade
save
for
one
gigantic
policeman
and
a
few
distant
carriages
was
apparently
deserted
and
the
line
of
dimly
lighted
hotels
stretching
vaguely
east
and
west
had
an
air
grim
and
forlorn
at
that
hour
hilda
ran
down
the
steps
at
the
bottom
another
row
of
lamps
defined
the
shore
and
now
she
could
hear
the
tide
lapping
ceaselessly
amid
the
supporting
ironwork
of
the
pier
she
at
once
descried
the
figure
of
sarah
gailey
in
the
gloom
the
woman
was
moving
towards
the
faintly
white
edge
of
the
sea
hilda
started
to
run
after
her
first
across
smooth
asphalt
and
then
over
some
sails
stretched
out
to
dry
and
then
her
feet
sank
at
each
step
into
descending
ridges
of
loose
shingle
and
she
nearly
fell
at
length
she
came
to
firm
sand
and
stood
still
sarah
gailey
was
now
silhouetted
against
the
pale
shallows
of
foam
that
in
curves
divided
the
shore
from
the
sea
after
a
time
she
bent
down
rose
again
moved
towards
the
water
and
drew
back
hilda
did
not
stir
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
approach
the
lonely
figure
she
felt
that
to
go
and
accost
sarah
gailey
would
be
indelicate
and
inexcusable
she
felt
as
if
she
were
basely
spying
she
was
completely
at
a
loss
and
knew
not
how
to
act
but
presently
she
discerned
that
the
white
foam
was
circling
round
sarah
feet
and
that
sarah
was
standing
careless
in
the
midst
of
it
and
at
last
timid
and
shaking
with
agitation
she
ventured
nearer
and
nearer
and
sarah
heard
her
on
the
sand
and
looked
behind
miss
gailey
she
appealed
in
a
trembling
voice
sarah
made
no
response
of
any
kind
and
hilda
reached
the
edge
of
the
foam
please
please
do
stand
there
you
catch
a
dreadful
cold
and
you
got
nothing
on
your
shoulders
either
i
want
to
make
a
hole
in
the
water
said
sarah
miserably
i
wanted
to
make
a
hole
in
the
water
please
do
come
back
with
me
hilda
implored
but
she
spoke
mechanically
as
though
saying
something
which
she
was
bound
to
say
but
which
she
did
not
feel
the
foam
capriciously
receded
and
hilda
still
without
any
effort
of
her
own
will
stepped
across
the
glistening
yielding
sand
and
took
sarah
gailey
arm
there
was
no
resistance
i
wanted
to
make
a
hole
in
the
water
sarah
repeated
but
i
made
a
mistake
i
ought
to
have
gone
to
that
groin
over
there
i
knew
there
was
a
groin
near
here
only
it
so
long
since
i
was
here
i
forgotten
just
the
place
but
what
the
matter
hilda
asked
leading
her
away
from
the
sea
she
was
not
extremely
surprised
but
she
was
shocked
into
a
most
solemn
awe
as
she
pressed
the
arm
of
the
poor
tragic
woman
who
but
for
an
accident
might
have
plunged
off
the
end
of
the
groin
into
water
deep
enough
for
drowning
she
did
really
feel
humble
before
this
creature
who
had
deliberately
invited
death
she
in
no
way
criticized
her
she
did
not
even
presume
to
condescend
towards
the
hasty
clumsiness
of
sarah
gailey
scheme
to
die
she
was
overwhelmed
by
the
woman
utterly
unconscious
impressiveness
which
exceeded
that
of
a
criminal
reprieved
on
the
scaffold
for
the
woman
had
dared
an
experience
that
only
the
fierce
and
sublime
courage
of
desperation
can
affront
she
had
a
feeling
that
she
ought
to
apologize
profoundly
to
sarah
gailey
for
all
that
sarah
must
have
suffered
and
as
she
heard
the
ceaseless
cruel
play
of
the
water
amid
the
dark
jungle
of
ironwork
under
the
pier
and
the
soft
creeping
of
the
behind
and
the
vague
stirrings
of
the
round
about
these
phenomena
combined
mysteriously
with
the
immensity
of
the
dome
above
and
with
the
baffling
strangeness
of
the
town
and
with
the
grandeur
of
the
beaten
woman
by
her
side
and
communicated
to
hilda
a
thrill
that
was
divine
in
its
unexampled
poignancy
the
great
figure
of
the
policeman
suspicious
was
descending
from
the
promenade
discreetly
towards
them
to
avoid
any
encounter
with
him
hilda
guided
her
companion
towards
the
pier
and
they
sheltered
there
under
the
resounding
floor
of
the
pier
by
the
light
of
one
of
the
lower
lamps
hilda
could
now
clearly
see
sarah
gailey
face
it
showed
no
sign
of
terror
it
was
calm
enough
in
its
worn
resigned
woe
it
had
the
girlish
look
again
beneath
the
marks
of
age
hilda
could
distinguish
the
young
girl
that
sarah
had
once
been
come
home
will
you
she
entreated
sarah
gailey
sighed
terribly
i
give
it
up
she
said
with
weariness
i
could
never
do
it
i
could
never
do
it
now
hilda
pulled
gently
at
her
unwilling
arm
she
could
not
speak
she
could
not
ask
her
again
what
the
matter
it
is
that
the
house
is
too
large
sarah
gailey
went
on
half
meditatively
though
just
think
of
all
those
stairs
and
not
a
tap
on
any
of
the
upper
floors
no
and
it
is
that
i
not
ready
enough
to
oblige
him
no
i
know
as
well
as
anybody
there
only
him
between
me
and
starvation
no
it
is
that
he
does
consider
me
no
but
when
he
goes
and
settles
behind
my
back
with
those
boutwoods
she
began
to
weep
and
when
i
can
hear
you
and
him
discussing
me
in
the
next
room
and
plotting
against
me
it
it
more
the
tears
gradually
drowned
her
voice
and
she
ceased
i
assure
you
you
quite
mistaken
hilda
burst
out
with
passionate
and
indignant
persuasiveness
we
never
mentioned
you
he
wanted
to
talk
to
me
about
my
money
and
if
you
feel
like
that
over
the
boutwoods
certain
he
tell
them
they
must
come
sarah
gailey
shook
her
head
blankly
i
certain
he
will
hilda
persisted
please
the
other
began
to
walk
away
dragging
hilda
with
her
the
policeman
inspecting
them
from
a
distance
coughed
and
withdrew
they
climbed
a
flight
of
steps
on
the
far
side
of
the
pier
crossed
the
promenade
and
went
up
preston
street
in
silence
i
should
prefer
not
to
be
seen
going
in
with
you
said
sarah
gailey
suddenly
it
might
she
freed
her
arm
go
down
the
area
steps
said
hilda
and
i
wait
a
moment
and
then
go
in
at
the
front
door
sarah
gailey
hurried
forward
alone
hilda
watching
her
and
observing
the
wet
footmarks
which
she
left
on
the
pavement
was
appalled
by
the
sense
of
her
own
responsibility
as
to
the
future
of
sarah
gailey
till
this
hour
even
at
her
most
conscientious
she
had
the
seriousness
of
sarah
case
everybody
had
the
seriousness
of
sarah
case
she
became
aware
of
some
one
hurrying
cautiously
up
the
street
on
the
other
side
it
was
george
cannon
as
soon
as
sarah
had
disappeared
within
the
house
he
crossed
over
what
the
matter
he
inquired
anxiously
well
she
has
been
trying
to
drown
herself
has
she
hilda
nodded
and
speechless
moved
towards
the
house
he
turned
abruptly
away
the
front
door
of
no
was
still
open
hilda
passed
through
the
silent
hall
and
went
timorously
down
the
steps
to
the
basement
the
gas
was
still
burning
and
the
clothes
were
still
strewn
about
in
sarah
bedroom
just
as
though
naught
had
happened
sarah
stood
between
her
two
trunks
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
where
george
she
asked
in
a
harsh
perfectly
ordinary
voice
i
do
think
he
in
the
parlour
hilda
prevaricated
promise
me
you
wo
tell
him
of
course
i
wo
said
hilda
kindly
do
get
into
bed
and
let
me
make
you
some
tea
sarah
gailey
rushed
at
her
and
embraced
her
i
know
i
all
wrong
i
know
it
all
my
own
fault
she
murmured
with
plaintive
feeble
contrition
crying
again
but
you
no
idea
how
i
try
if
it
was
for
you
iv
that
night
hilda
in
her
small
bedroom
at
the
top
of
the
house
was
listlessly
arranging
at
the
back
of
the
the
few
volumes
which
had
clung
to
her
or
to
which
she
had
clung
throughout
the
convulsive
disturbances
following
her
mother
death
among
them
was
one
which
she
did
not
wish
to
keep
girls
book
and
also
the
whole
set
of
victor
hugo
which
did
not
belong
to
her
george
cannon
had
lent
her
the
latter
in
instalments
and
she
had
omitted
to
return
it
she
was
saying
to
herself
that
the
opportunity
to
return
it
had
at
length
arrived
when
she
heard
a
low
conspiratorial
tapping
at
the
door
all
her
skin
crept
as
after
a
second
startled
hesitation
she
moved
to
open
the
door
george
cannon
holding
a
candle
stood
on
the
landing
she
had
not
seen
him
since
the
brief
colloquy
between
them
outside
the
house
having
satisfied
herself
that
sarah
gailey
was
safe
and
to
a
certain
extent
tranquillized
for
the
night
she
had
awaited
george
reappearance
a
long
time
in
vain
and
had
then
retired
upstairs
you
are
gone
to
bed
he
whispered
very
cautiously
within
a
few
feet
of
them
was
an
airless
kennel
where
louisa
the
chambermaid
slept
no
i
just
i
stayed
up
for
you
i
do
know
how
long
is
she
all
right
well
she
in
bed
i
wish
you
come
to
one
of
these
other
rooms
he
continued
to
whisper
all
the
sibilants
in
his
words
seemed
to
detach
themselves
hissing
from
the
rest
of
the
sounds
she
gave
a
gesture
of
assent
he
tiptoed
over
the
traitorous
boards
of
the
landing
and
slowly
turned
the
knob
of
a
door
in
the
end
wall
the
door
exploded
like
the
firing
of
a
pistol
frowning
he
grimly
pushed
it
open
hilda
followed
him
noiselessly
creeping
he
held
the
door
for
her
she
entered
and
he
shut
the
door
on
the
inside
they
were
in
a
small
bedroom
similar
to
hilda
own
but
the
bed
was
stripped
the
square
of
carpet
rolled
the
blind
undrawn
and
the
curtains
looped
up
from
the
floor
he
put
the
candle
on
the
tiny
iron
mantelpiece
and
sat
on
the
bed
his
hands
in
his
pockets
you
do
mean
to
say
she
was
wanting
to
commit
suicide
he
said
after
a
short
reflective
silence
with
his
head
bent
but
his
eyes
raised
peeringly
to
hilda
the
crudity
of
the
word
affected
hilda
painfully
if
you
ask
me
said
she
standing
with
her
back
rubbing
against
the
small
wardrobe
she
did
know
quite
what
she
was
doing
but
no
doubt
that
was
what
she
went
out
for
you
overtook
her
i
saw
you
coming
up
from
the
beach
hilda
related
what
had
happened
but
had
you
any
notion
before
me
no
why
nothing
only
the
way
you
rushed
out
like
that
well
it
struck
me
all
of
a
sudden
you
not
seen
her
since
you
came
in
he
shook
his
head
i
thought
i
better
keep
out
of
the
way
i
thought
i
better
leave
it
all
to
you
it
appalling
simply
appalling
just
when
everything
was
shaping
so
well
hilda
thought
bewildered
so
well
with
her
glance
she
took
in
the
little
cheerless
bedroom
and
herself
and
george
cannon
within
it
overwhelmed
in
imagination
she
saw
all
the
other
bedrooms
dark
forlorn
and
inanimate
waiting
through
long
nights
and
empty
days
until
some
human
creature
as
pathetic
as
themselves
should
come
and
feebly
vitalize
them
into
a
spurious
transient
homeliness
and
she
saw
george
cannon
bedroom
the
harsh
bedroom
of
the
bachelor
who
had
never
had
a
home
and
the
bedrooms
of
those
fearsome
mummies
the
watchetts
each
bed
with
its
grisly
face
on
the
pillow
in
the
dark
and
the
kennels
of
the
unclean
servants
and
so
descending
through
the
floors
to
sarah
gailey
bedroom
in
the
very
earth
and
the
sleepless
form
on
that
bed
beneath
the
whole
and
the
organism
of
the
seemed
absolutely
tragic
to
her
compact
of
the
stuff
of
sorrow
itself
and
yet
george
cannon
had
said
so
well
what
to
be
done
he
inquired
plaintively
nothing
that
i
can
see
she
said
she
had
a
tremendous
desire
to
escape
from
the
responsibility
thrust
on
her
by
the
situation
but
she
knew
that
she
could
never
escape
from
it
that
she
was
immovably
pinned
down
by
it
i
ca
see
anything
either
said
he
quietly
responsive
and
speaking
now
in
a
gentle
voice
supposing
i
tell
her
that
she
can
go
and
that
i
make
her
an
allowance
what
could
she
do
then
it
would
be
madness
for
her
to
live
alone
any
more
she
the
very
last
person
who
ought
to
live
alone
moreover
she
would
accept
the
allowance
well
then
she
must
stay
with
me
here
and
if
she
stays
here
she
must
work
otherwise
she
never
stay
not
she
and
she
must
be
the
mistress
she
stand
having
anyone
above
her
or
even
equal
with
her
that
a
certainty
besides
she
so
good
at
her
job
she
has
got
a
great
deal
of
system
so
far
as
i
can
see
but
she
can
get
the
work
out
of
the
servants
without
too
much
fuss
and
she
so
mighty
economical
in
her
catering
of
course
she
ca
get
on
the
right
side
of
a
boarder
but
then
i
and
that
the
whole
point
with
me
on
the
spot
to
the
place
she
be
perfect
perfect
could
wish
for
anything
better
and
now
she
i
assure
you
i
doing
the
best
i
can
do
for
her
i
do
honestly
assure
you
if
anybody
can
suggest
to
me
anything
else
that
i
can
do
i
do
it
like
a
shot
he
threw
up
his
arms
hilda
was
touched
by
the
benevolence
of
his
tone
nevertheless
it
only
intensified
her
helpless
perplexity
sarah
gailey
was
inexpressibly
to
be
pitied
but
george
cannon
was
not
to
be
blamed
she
had
a
feeling
that
for
any
piteous
disaster
some
one
ought
to
be
definitely
blamable
do
you
think
she
settle
down
george
cannon
asked
in
a
new
voice
oh
yes
said
hilda
i
think
she
will
it
was
just
a
sort
of
attack
she
had
i
think
she
not
vexed
with
me
hilda
could
not
find
courage
to
say
she
thinks
you
and
i
are
plotting
against
her
and
yet
she
wondered
why
she
should
hesitate
to
say
it
after
a
pause
she
murmured
as
casually
as
possible
she
does
like
the
boutwoods
coming
back
i
knew
you
were
going
to
say
that
he
frowned
if
you
could
manage
to
stop
them
no
no
he
interrupted
nervous
impatient
it
would
do
that
would
it
never
do
a
ca
be
run
on
those
lines
it
is
that
i
care
so
much
as
all
that
about
losing
a
couple
of
boarders
and
i
not
specially
keen
on
the
boutwoods
but
it
do
it
the
wrong
principle
you
have
got
to
let
customers
get
on
your
nerves
so
long
as
they
pay
and
behave
respectably
if
i
gave
way
the
very
first
thing
sarah
would
do
would
be
to
find
a
grievance
against
some
other
boarder
and
there
be
no
end
to
it
the
fact
is
she
wants
a
grievance
she
must
have
a
grievance
whether
it
the
boutwoods
or
somebody
else
makes
no
matter
oh
no
he
repeated
softly
gently
oh
no
she
knew
that
his
argument
was
unanswerable
she
was
perfectly
aware
that
she
ought
to
yield
to
it
nevertheless
the
one
impulse
of
her
being
in
that
moment
was
to
fight
blindly
and
irrationally
against
it
her
instinct
said
i
do
care
for
arguments
the
boutwoods
must
be
stopped
from
coming
if
they
are
stopped
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
that
poor
woman
meeting
them
again
i
bear
it
she
drew
breath
sharply
startling
hot
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
she
stepped
forward
on
her
left
foot
please
she
entreated
please
do
let
them
come
there
was
a
silence
in
the
agonizing
silence
she
felt
acutely
her
girlishness
her
helplessness
her
unreason
confronted
by
his
strong
and
shrewd
masculinity
at
the
bottom
of
her
soul
she
knew
how
wrong
she
was
but
she
was
ready
to
do
anything
to
save
sarah
gailey
from
the
distress
of
one
particular
humiliation
with
the
whole
of
her
volition
she
wanted
to
win
oh
well
he
said
of
course
if
you
take
it
so
much
to
heart
a
peculiar
bright
glance
shot
from
his
eyes
the
old
glance
that
at
once
negligently
asserted
his
power
over
her
and
reassured
her
against
his
power
her
being
was
suffused
with
gladness
and
pride
she
had
won
she
had
won
in
defiance
of
reason
she
had
appealed
and
she
had
conquered
and
she
enjoyed
his
glance
she
gloried
in
it
she
blushed
a
spasm
of
exquisite
fear
shot
through
her
and
she
savoured
it
deliciously
the
deep
organic
sadness
of
the
house
presented
itself
to
her
in
a
new
light
it
was
still
sadness
but
it
was
beautiful
in
the
background
her
sympathy
for
sarah
gailey
was
as
keen
as
ever
but
it
had
a
different
quality
an
anguish
less
desolating
and
the
fact
that
a
joint
responsibility
for
sarah
gailey
welfare
bound
herself
and
george
cannon
together
in
spite
of
themselves
this
fact
seemed
to
her
grandiose
and
romantic
no
longer
oppressive
to
be
alone
with
him
in
the
secrecy
of
the
small
upper
room
seemed
to
endow
her
with
a
splendid
worldly
importance
and
yet
all
the
time
a
voice
was
saying
clearly
within
her
this
appeal
and
this
abandonment
are
unworthy
no
matter
if
this
man
is
kind
and
sincere
and
admirable
this
appeal
and
this
abandonment
are
unworthy
but
she
did
not
care
she
ignored
the
voice
i
tell
sarah
in
the
morning
he
said
please
do
she
begged
you
might
pretend
later
on
that
you
had
a
letter
from
the
boutwoods
and
they
ca
come
if
you
tell
her
she
guess
at
once
i
been
talking
to
you
and
you
not
supposed
to
know
anything
at
all
about
what
happened
she
made
me
promise
but
of
course
she
did
know
that
you
found
out
for
yourself
you
see
george
cannon
walked
away
to
the
window
and
then
to
the
mantelpiece
from
which
he
took
up
the
candle
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
he
said
simply
putting
a
faint
emphasis
on
the
last
word
she
knew
that
he
meant
it
without
any
reserves
but
in
his
urbane
tone
there
was
a
chill
tranquillity
that
astonished
and
vaguely
disappointed
her
book
iv
her
fall
chapter
i
the
going
concern
i
on
a
saturday
afternoon
of
the
following
august
hilda
was
sitting
at
a
book
in
the
basement
parlour
of
cannon
in
preston
street
she
heard
through
the
open
window
several
pairs
of
feet
mounting
wearily
to
the
front
door
and
then
the
long
remote
tinkling
of
the
bell
within
the
house
there
was
no
responsive
sound
but
from
the
porch
came
a
clearing
of
throats
a
muttering
impatient
and
yet
resigned
and
a
vague
shuffling
after
a
long
pause
the
bell
rang
again
and
then
the
gas
globe
over
hilda
head
vibrated
for
a
moment
to
footsteps
in
the
hall
and
the
front
door
was
unlatched
she
could
not
catch
the
precise
question
but
the
reply
of
louisa
the
chambermaid
haughty
scornful
and
negligently
pitying
was
quite
clear
sorry
sir
we
full
up
we
had
to
refuse
several
this
very
day
no
i
could
rightly
tell
you
where
you
might
try
no
as
they
call
it
but
we
full
up
good
afternoon
sir
afternoon
the
door
banged
arrogantly
the
feet
redescended
to
the
pavement
and
hilda
throwing
a
careless
glance
at
the
window
saw
two
men
and
a
woman
pass
melancholy
down
the
hot
street
with
their
and
although
she
condemned
and
despised
the
louisa
who
would
have
abased
herself
with
sickly
smiles
and
sweet
phrases
before
the
applicants
if
the
house
had
needed
custom
although
in
her
mind
she
was
saying
curtly
to
the
mature
louisa
it
a
good
thing
cannon
did
hear
you
using
that
tone
to
customers
my
girl
nevertheless
she
could
not
help
feeling
somewhat
as
louisa
felt
it
was
indubitably
agreeable
to
hear
a
prosperous
door
closed
on
dusty
and
disappointed
and
to
realize
in
her
tranquil
retreat
that
she
was
part
of
a
very
thriving
and
successful
concern
ii
george
cannon
in
a
light
and
elegant
summer
suit
passed
slowly
in
front
of
the
window
and
looking
for
hilda
in
her
accustomed
place
saw
her
and
nodded
surprised
by
the
unusual
gesture
she
moved
uneasily
and
blushed
and
as
she
did
so
she
asked
herself
resentfully
why
do
i
behave
like
this
i
only
his
clerk
and
i
shall
never
be
anything
else
but
his
clerk
and
yet
i
do
believe
i
getting
worse
instead
of
better
george
cannon
skipped
easily
up
to
the
porch
he
had
a
latchkey
but
before
he
could
put
it
into
the
keyhole
louisa
had
flown
down
the
stairs
and
opened
the
door
to
him
she
must
have
been
on
the
watch
from
an
upper
floor
george
cannon
would
have
been
well
served
whatever
his
situation
in
the
house
for
he
was
one
of
those
genial
bullies
who
are
adored
by
the
menials
whom
they
alternately
cajole
and
terrorize
but
his
situation
in
the
house
was
that
of
a
god
and
like
a
god
he
was
attended
he
was
the
very
creator
of
the
house
all
its
life
flowed
from
him
without
him
the
organism
would
have
ceased
to
exist
and
everybody
in
it
was
quite
aware
of
this
he
had
fully
learnt
his
business
he
had
learnt
it
in
the
fishmarket
on
the
beach
at
seven
in
the
morning
and
in
the
vegetable
market
at
eight
and
in
the
shops
he
had
learnt
it
in
the
kitchen
and
on
the
stairs
while
the
servants
were
cleaning
and
he
had
learnt
it
at
the
surrounded
by
his
customers
there
was
nothing
that
he
did
not
know
and
except
actual
cooking
and
mending
little
that
he
could
not
do
he
always
impressed
his
customers
by
the
statement
that
he
had
slept
in
every
room
in
the
house
in
order
to
understand
personally
its
qualities
and
defects
and
he
could
and
did
in
fact
talk
to
each
boarder
about
his
room
with
the
intimate
geographical
knowledge
of
a
native
the
boarders
were
further
flattered
by
the
mien
and
appearance
of
this
practical
housekeeper
who
did
not
in
the
least
resemble
his
kind
but
had
rather
the
style
of
a
slightly
doggish
stockbroker
to
be
strolling
on
the
king
road
in
converse
with
george
cannon
was
a
matter
of
pride
to
boarders
male
and
female
and
there
was
none
with
whom
he
could
not
talk
fluently
on
any
subject
from
cigars
to
ozone
according
to
the
needs
of
the
particular
case
nor
did
he
ever
seem
to
be
bored
by
conversations
but
sometimes
after
benignantly
speeding
for
instance
one
of
the
watchetts
on
her
morning
constitutional
he
would
slip
down
into
the
basement
and
ejaculate
hag
with
a
calm
and
natural
earnestness
which
frightened
hilda
indicating
as
it
did
that
he
must
be
capable
of
astounding
duplicities
he
came
now
directly
to
the
underground
parlour
hat
on
head
and
ebony
stick
in
hand
hilda
did
not
even
look
up
but
bent
a
little
lower
over
her
volume
her
relation
to
george
cannon
in
the
successful
enterprise
was
anomalous
and
yet
the
habit
of
ten
months
had
in
practice
defined
it
neither
paying
board
nor
receiving
wages
she
had
remained
in
the
house
apparently
as
sarah
gailey
companion
and
moral
support
she
had
remained
because
sarah
gailey
had
never
been
in
a
condition
to
be
left
and
the
months
had
passed
very
quickly
but
her
lack
of
occupation
and
her
knowledge
of
shorthand
and
george
obvious
need
of
clerical
aid
had
made
it
inevitable
that
they
should
resume
their
former
rôles
of
principal
and
clerk
hilda
worked
daily
at
letters
circularizing
advertisements
and
to
a
less
extent
accounts
and
bills
the
second
finger
of
her
right
hand
had
nearly
always
an
agreeable
stain
of
ink
at
the
base
of
the
nail
and
she
often
dreamed
about
in
this
prosperous
month
of
august
she
had
on
the
whole
less
work
than
usual
for
both
circulating
and
advertisements
were
stopped
george
cannon
went
to
the
desk
in
the
dark
corner
between
the
window
and
the
door
where
all
business
papers
were
kept
but
where
neither
he
nor
she
actually
wrote
when
his
back
was
turned
she
surreptitiously
glanced
at
him
without
moving
her
head
and
perceived
that
his
hand
was
only
moving
idly
about
among
the
papers
while
he
stared
at
the
wall
she
thought
half
in
alarm
what
is
the
matter
now
then
he
came
over
to
the
table
and
hesitated
by
her
shoulder
still
she
would
not
look
up
she
could
no
longer
decipher
a
single
word
on
the
page
her
being
was
somehow
monopolized
by
the
consciousness
of
his
nearness
interesting
he
inquired
she
turned
her
head
at
last
and
glanced
at
him
with
a
friendly
smile
of
affirmation
fingering
the
leaves
of
the
book
nervously
it
was
cranswick
of
one
day
a
fortnight
earlier
while
george
cannon
in
company
with
her
was
bargaining
for
an
old
london
directory
outside
a
bookseller
shop
in
east
street
she
had
seen
cranswick
of
labelled
published
at
our
price
and
had
opened
it
curiously
george
cannon
who
always
kept
an
eye
on
her
had
said
teasingly
i
suppose
it
your
journalistic
past
that
makes
you
interested
in
that
i
suppose
it
is
she
answered
which
statement
was
an
untruth
for
the
sole
thought
in
her
mind
had
been
that
edwin
clayhanger
was
a
printer
a
strange
idle
thought
she
had
laid
the
book
down
the
next
day
however
george
cannon
had
brought
it
home
saying
carelessly
i
bought
that
book
five
and
six
the
man
seemed
anxious
to
do
business
and
it
a
book
to
have
he
had
not
touched
it
since
page
he
murmured
looking
at
the
number
of
the
page
if
you
keep
on
at
this
rate
you
soon
know
more
about
printing
than
young
clayhanger
himself
she
was
thunderstruck
never
before
had
the
name
of
clayhanger
been
mentioned
between
them
could
he
then
penetrate
her
thoughts
could
he
guess
that
in
truth
she
was
reading
cranswick
solely
because
edwin
clayhanger
happened
to
be
a
printer
no
it
was
impossible
the
reason
of
her
interest
in
cranswick
inexplicable
even
to
herself
was
too
fantastic
to
be
divined
and
yet
was
not
his
tone
peculiar
or
was
it
only
in
her
fancy
that
his
tone
was
peculiar
she
blushed
scarlet
and
her
muscles
grew
rigid
i
say
george
cannon
continued
in
a
tone
that
now
was
unmistakably
peculiar
i
want
you
to
come
out
with
me
i
want
to
show
you
something
on
the
front
can
you
come
at
once
she
muttered
glumly
and
painfully
what
could
be
the
mystery
beneath
this
most
singular
behaviour
yes
florrie
will
be
arriving
at
five
said
hilda
after
artificially
coughing
i
ought
to
be
here
then
ought
i
oh
he
cried
we
shall
be
back
long
before
five
very
well
she
agreed
i
be
ready
in
three
minutes
he
said
going
gaily
towards
the
door
from
the
door
he
gave
her
a
glance
she
met
it
courageously
exposing
her
troubled
features
and
nodded
iii
hilda
went
into
the
bedroom
behind
the
parlour
to
get
her
hat
and
gloves
a
consequence
of
the
success
of
the
was
that
she
was
temporarily
sharing
this
chamber
with
sarah
gailey
she
had
insisted
on
making
the
sacrifice
and
she
enjoyed
the
personal
discomfort
which
it
involved
when
she
cautiously
lay
down
on
the
narrow
and
lumpy
that
had
been
insinuated
against
an
unoccupied
wall
and
when
she
turned
over
restlessly
in
the
night
and
the
rickety
ironwork
creaked
and
sarah
gailey
moaned
and
when
she
searched
vainly
for
a
particular
garment
lost
among
garments
that
were
hung
on
insecure
hooks
and
jutting
corners
of
furniture
she
was
proud
and
glad
because
her
own
comfortable
room
was
steadily
adding
thirty
shillings
or
more
per
week
to
the
gross
receipts
of
the
enterprise
the
benefit
was
in
no
way
hers
and
yet
she
gloated
on
it
thinking
pleasurably
of
george
cannon
great
japanned
which
seemed
to
be
an
exhaustless
store
of
gold
sovereigns
and
large
silver
and
of
his
mysterious
almost
furtive
visits
to
the
bank
her
own
capital
invested
by
george
cannon
in
railway
stock
was
bringing
in
four
times
as
much
as
she
disbursed
and
she
gloated
also
on
her
savings
the
more
money
she
amassed
the
less
willing
was
she
to
spend
this
nascent
avarice
amused
her
as
a
new
trait
in

character
always
amuses
the
individual

said
to
herself
i
am
getting
quite
a
miser
with
the
assured
reservation
of
course
i
can
stop
being
a
miser

stopping
sarah
gailey
was
lulling
herself
in
a
when
hilda
entered
and
she
neither
regarded
hilda
nor
intermitted
her
her
features
were
drawn
into
a
preoccupied
expression
of
martyrdom
and
in
fact
she
constantly
suffered
physical
torture
she
had
three
genuine
complaints
rheumatism
sciatica
and
neuritis
they
were
all
painful
the
latest
and
worst
was
the
neuritis
which
had
attacked
her
in
the
wrist
producing
swollen
joints
that
had
to
be
fomented
with
hot
water
sarah
gailey
life
had
indeed
latterly
developed
into
a
continual
fomentation
and
a
continual
rocking
she
was
so
taken
up
with
the
elemental
business
of
fomenting
and
of
keeping
warm
that
she
had
no
energy
left
for
other
remedial
treatments
such
as
distraction
in
the
open
air
she
sat
for
ever
shawled
generally
with
heavy
mittens
on
her
arms
and
wrists
and
either
fomenting
or
rocking
in
the
eternal
twilight
of
the
basement
bedroom
she
eschewed
aid
she
could
manage
for
herself
and
she
did
not
encourage
company
apparently
preferring
to
be
alone
with
fate
in
her
easier
hours
one
hand
resting
on
another
and
both
hugged
close
to
her
breast
rocking
to
and
fro
with
an
astounding
monotonous
perseverance
she
was
like
a
mysterious
indian
god
in
a
subterranean
temple
above
her
unseen
by
her
floor
beyond
floor
the
life
of
the
functioned
in
the
great
holiday
month
of
august
i
quite
forgot
about
the
bed
for
florrie
said
sarah
gailey
plaintively
as
she
rocked
would
you
have
time
to
see
to
it
of
course
she
will
have
to
be
with
louisa
very
well
said
hilda
curtly
and
not
quite
hiding
exasperation
there
were
three
reasons
for
her
exasperation
in
the
first
place
the
constant
spectacle
of
sarah
gailey
pain
and
the
effect
of
the
pain
on
sarah
character
was
exasperating
to
hilda
as
well
as
to
george
cannon
both
well
knew
that
the
fretful
spinster
was
a
victim
utterly
innocent
and
utterly
helpless
of
destiny
and
that
she
merited
nothing
but
patient
sympathy
yet
often
the
strain
of
relationship
with
sarah
produced
in
them
such
a
profound
feeling
of
annoyance
that
they
positively
resented
sarah
sufferings
and
with
a
sad
absence
of
logic
blamed
her
in
her
misfortune
just
as
though
she
had
wilfully
brought
the
maladies
upon
herself
in
order
to
vex
them
then
further
it
was
necessary
always
to
minister
to
sarah
illusion
that
sarah
was
the
mainstay
of
the
house
that
she
attended
to
everything
and
was
responsible
for
everything
and
that
without
her
governance
the
machine
would
come
to
a
disastrous
standstill
the
fact
being
that
she
had
grown
feeble
and
superfluous
sarah
had
taught
all
she
knew
to
two
highly
intelligent
pupils
and
had
survived
her
usefulness
she
had
no
right
place
on
earth
but
in
her
morose
inefficiency
she
had
developed
into
an
unconscious
tyrant
a
tyrant
whose
power
lay
in
the
loyalty
of
her
subjects
and
not
at
all
in
her
own
soul
she
was
indeed
like
a
deity
immanent
brooding
and
unaware
of
itself
thus
the
question
of
florrie
bed
had
been
discussed
and
settled
long
before
sarah
gailey
had
even
thought
of
it
but
hilda
might
not
tell
her
so
lastly
this
very
question
of
florrie
bed
was
exasperating
to
hilda
already
louisa
kennel
was
inadequate
for
louisa
and
now
another
couch
had
been
crowded
into
it
hilda
was
ashamed
of
the
shift
but
there
was
no
alternative
here
for
hilda
was
the
secret
canker
of
george
cannon
brilliant
success
the
servants
were
kindly
in
the
commercial
triumph
she
lost
the
sense
of
the
tragic
forlornness
of
existence
as
it
had
struck
her
on
the
day
of
her
arrival
but
the
image
of
the
indian
god
in
the
basement
and
of
the
prone
forms
of
the
servants
in
stifling
black
cupboards
under
the
roof
and
under
the
stairs
these
images
embittered
at
intervals
the
instinctive
and
reflecting
exultation
of
her
moods
she
adjusted
her
small
flowered
hat
dropped
her
parasol
across
the
bed
and
began
to
draw
on
her
cotton
gloves
where
are
you
going
dear
asked
sarah
gailey
out
with
mr
cannon
but
where
i
do
know
in
spite
of
herself
there
was
a
certain
unnecessary
defiance
in
hilda
voice
you
do
know
dear
sarah
gailey
suddenly
ceased
rocking
and
glanced
at
hilda
with
the
mournful
expression
of
acute
worry
that
was
so
terribly
familiar
on
her
features
although
it
was
notorious
that
baseless
apprehensions
were
a
part
of
sarah
disease
nevertheless
hilda
could
never
succeed
in
treating
any
given
apprehension
as
quite
baseless
and
now
sarah
mere
tone
begot
in
hilda
a
vague
alarm
she
continued
busy
with
her
gloves
silent
and
on
saturday
afternoon
too
when
everybody
abroad
sarah
gailey
added
gloomily
with
her
involuntary
small
movements
of
the
head
he
asked
me
if
i
could
go
out
with
him
for
a
minute
or
two
at
once
said
hilda
and
picked
up
the
parasol
with
a
decisive
gesture
there
a
great
deal
too
much
talk
about
you
and
george
as
it
is
said
sarah
with
an
acrid
firmness
talk
about
me
and
hilda
cried
absolutely
astounded
she
had
no
feeling
of
guilt
but
she
knew
that
she
was
looking
guilty
and
this
knowledge
induced
in
her
the
actual
sensations
of
a
criminal
i
sure
i
do
want
sarah
gailey
began
and
was
interrupted
by
a
quiet
tap
at
the
door
george
cannon
entered
ready
miss
he
demanded
smiling
before
he
had
caught
sight
of
her
face
for
the
second
time
that
afternoon
he
saw
her
scarlet
and
now
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
too
she
hesitated
an
instant
yes
she
answered
with
a
painful
gulp
and
moved
towards
the
door
chapter
ii
the
unknown
adventure
i
when
they
were
fairly
out
in
the
street
hilda
felt
like
a
mariner
who
has
escaped
from
a
lee
shore
but
who
is
beset
by
the
vaguer
and
even
more
formidable
perils
of
the
open
sea
she
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
agitation
and
much
too
to
be
properly
cognisant
of
her
surroundings
she
did
not
feel
the
pavement
with
her
feet
she
had
no
recollection
of
having
passed
out
of
the
house
there
she
was
walking
along
on
nothing
by
the
side
of
a
man
who
might
or
might
not
be
george
cannon
amid
tall
objects
that
resembled
houses
her
situation
was
in
a
high
degree
painful
but
she
could
not
have
avoided
it
she
could
not
in
sarah
bedroom
have
fallen
into
sobs
or
into
a
rage
or
into
the
sulks
and
told
george
cannon
that
she
would
not
go
with
him
she
could
not
have
dashed
hysterically
away
and
hidden
herself
on
an
upper
floor
in
the
manner
of
a
startled
fawn
her
spirit
was
too
high
for
such
tricks
on
the
other
hand
she
was
by
no
means
sufficiently
mistress
of
herself
to
be
able
to
hide
from
him
her
shame
hence
she
faced
him
and
followed
him
and
let
him
see
it
their
long
familiarity
had
made
this
surrender
somewhat
easier
for
her
after
all
in
the
countless
daily
contacts
they
had
grown
accustomed
to
minor
and
hilda
more
so
than
george
cannon
hilda
was
too
impatient
and
impulsive
not
to
tear
at
increasingly
frequent
intervals
the
veil
of
conventional
formality
her
mood
now
as
she
accompanied
george
cannon
on
the
unknown
adventure
was
one
of
abashed
but
still
fierce
resentment
she
of
course
believed
sarah
gailey
statement
that
there
had
been
talk
about
herself
and
the
landlord
and
yet
it
was
so
utterly
monstrous
as
to
be
almost
incredible
she
was
absolutely
sure
that
she
had
never
by
her
behaviour
furnished
the
slightest
excuse
for
such
talk
no
eavesdropper
could
ever
have
caught
the
least
word
or
gesture
to
justify
it
could
a
malicious
eavesdropper
have
assisted
at
the
secret
operations
of
her
inmost
mind
even
then
he
could
scarcely
have
seen
aught
to
justify
it
existence
at
brighton
had
been
too
strenuous
and
strange
and
with
sarah
gailey
in
the
house
too
full
of
responsibilities
to
favour
dalliance
hilda
examining
herself
could
not
say
that
she
had
not
once
thought
of
george
cannon
as
a
husband
because
just
as
a
young
solitary
man
will
imagine
himself
the
spouse
of
a
dozen
different
girls
in
a
week
so
will
an
unmated
girl
picture
herself
united
to
every
eligible
and
passably
sympathetic
male
that
crosses
her
path
it
is
the
everyday
diversion
of
the
fancy
but
she
could
say
that
she
had
not
once
thought
seriously
of
george
cannon
as
a
husband
why
he
was
not
of
her
generation
although
she
did
not
know
his
age
she
guessed
that
he
must
be
nearer
forty
than
thirty
he
was
of
the
generation
of
sarah
gailey
and
sarah
gailey
was
the
contemporary
of
her
dead
mother
and
he
had
never
shown
for
her
any
sentiment
but
that
of
a
benevolently
teasing
kindliness
moreover
she
was
afraid
of
him
beyond
question
and
withal
he
patently
lacked
certain
qualities
which
were
to
be
found
in
her
image
of
a
perfect
man
no
she
had
more
often
thought
of
edwin
clayhanger
as
a
husband
indeed
she
had
married
edwin
clayhanger
several
times
the
haunting
youth
would
not
leave
her
alone
and
she
said
to
herself
hot
and
indignant
i
shall
have
to
leave
brighton
i
can
see
that
sarah
gailey
brought
it
on
herself
yes
she
was
actually
angry
with
sarah
gailey
who
however
had
only
informed
her
of
a
fact
which
she
would
have
been
sorry
not
to
know
and
in
leaving
brighton
that
fancy
of
hers
took
her
straight
to
bursley
to
stay
with
janet
orgreave
in
the
house
next
to
the
new
house
of
the
clayhangers
whither
was
george
cannon
leading
her
he
had
not
yet
said
a
word
in
explanation
of
the
errand
nor
shown
in
any
way
that
he
had
observed
her
extraordinary
condition
he
was
silent
swinging
his
stick
she
also
was
silent
she
could
not
have
spoken
not
even
to
murmur
where
are
you
taking
me
to
they
went
forward
as
in
an
enchantment
ii
they
were
on
the
king
road
and
to
the
left
were
the
high
hotels
and
houses
stretching
east
and
west
under
the
glare
of
the
sun
into
invisibility
and
to
the
right
was
the
shore
and
the
sea
so
bright
that
the
eye
could
scarcely
rest
on
it
both
the
upper
and
the
lower
promenades
were
crowded
with
gay
people
surging
in
different
directions
the
dusty
roadway
was
full
of
carriages
and
of
the
glint
of
the
sun
on
wheelspokes
and
horses
flanks
and
of
rolling
shadows
the
shore
was
bordered
with
flags
and
masts
and
white
and
brown
sails
and
in
the
of
billows
harmlessly
breaking
could
be
seen
the
yellow
bodies
of
the
bathers
a
dozen
men
got
hold
of
a
yacht
under
sail
with
as
many
passengers
on
board
and
pushed
it
forcibly
right
down
into
the
sea
and
then
up
sprang
its
nose
and
it
heeled
over
and
shot
suddenly
off
careering
on
the
waves
into
the
offing
where
other
yachts
were
sliding
to
and
fro
between
the
piers
dominating
errant
fleets
of
rowboats
and
the
piers
also
were
loaded
with
excited
humanity
and
radiant
colour
and
all
the
windows
of
all
the
houses
and
hotels
were
open
and
blowing
with
curtains
and
flowers
and
hats
the
whole
town
was
enfevered
hilda
thought
her
heart
still
beating
but
less
noisily
i
scarcely
ever
come
here
i
do
come
here
often
enough
and
she
saw
sarah
gailey
rocking
and
sighing
and
rocking
and
shaking
her
head
in
the
mournful
twilight
of
the
basement
in
preston
street
the
contrasts
of
existence
struck
her
as
magnificent
as
superb
the
very
misery
and
hopelessness
of
sarah
isolation
seemed
romantic
splendid
touchingly
beautiful
and
she
thought
inexplicably
why
am
i
here
why
am
i
not
at
home
in
turnhill
why
am
i
so
different
from
what
mother
was
what
am
i
going
to
be
and
to
do
this
that
i
now
am
ca
continue
for
ever
she
saw
thousands
of
women
with
thousands
of
men
and
quite
forgetting
that
to
the
view
of
the
multitude
she
was
just
as
much
as
any
of
them
with
a
man
and
a
rather
fine
man
too
she
began
to
pity
herself
because
she
was
not
with
a
man
she
dreamed
in
her
extreme
excitation
of
belonging
absolutely
to
some
man
and
despite
all
her
pride
and
independence
she
dwelt
with
pleasure
and
longing
on
the
vision
of
being
his
of
being
at
his
disposal
of
being
under
his
might
of
being
helpless
before
him
she
thought
desolated
i
am
nobody
and
so
there
is
she
scorned
herself
for
being
nobody
to
belong
utterly
to
some
male
seemed
to
be
the
one
tolerable
fate
for
her
in
the
world
and
it
was
a
glorious
fate
whether
it
brought
good
or
evil
any
other
was
ignobly
futile
was
despicable
and
then
she
thought
savagely
and
just
see
my
clothes
why
do
i
take
the
trouble
to
look
nice
suddenly
george
cannon
stopped
on
the
edge
of
the
pavement
and
turned
towards
the
houses
across
the
street
you
see
that
he
said
pointing
with
his
stick
what
the
chichester
she
saw
in
gold
letters
over
the
front
of
a
tall
corner
house
the
chichester
private
hotel
well
i
taken
it
from
christmas
i
signed
about
an
hour
ago
i
just
had
to
tell
someone
well
i
never
hilda
exclaimed
he
was
beyond
question
an
extraordinary
and
an
impressive
man
he
had
said
that
after
experimenting
in
preston
street
he
should
take
a
larger
place
and
lo
in
less
than
a
year
he
had
fulfilled
his
word
he
had
experimented
in
preston
street
with
immense
success
and
now
he
was
coming
out
into
the
king
road
only
those
who
have
lived
in
a
side
street
can
pronounce
the
fine
words
road
with
the
proper
accent
of
deference
and
every
house
in
the
king
road
hilda
now
newly
perceived
was
a
house
of
price
and
distinction
nothing
could
be
common
in
the
king
road
the
address
and
the
view
were
incomparably
precious
being
established
there
george
cannon
might
and
no
doubt
would
ultimately
acquire
one
of
the
largest
public
hotels
indeed
dominate
the
promenade
it
would
be
just
like
him
to
do
so
a
year
ago
he
was
a
solicitor
in
turnhill
he
was
so
perfectly
and
entirely
a
landlord
that
no
one
could
ever
guess
his
first
career
he
was
not
merely
extraordinary
he
was
astounding
there
could
not
be
many
of
his
calibre
in
the
whole
world
how
does
it
strike
you
he
asked
with
an
eagerness
that
touched
her
oh
it
splendid
she
answered
trying
to
put
more
natural
enthusiasm
into
her
voice
but
the
fact
was
that
the
chichester
had
not
yet
struck
her
at
all
it
was
only
the
idea
of
being
in
the
king
road
that
had
struck
her
and
with
such
an
effect
that
her
attention
was
happily
diverted
from
her
trouble
and
her
vexatious
disappeared
she
had
from
time
to
time
remarked
the
chichester
but
never
with
any
particularity
it
had
been
for
her
just
an
establishment
among
innumerable
others
and
not
one
of
the
best
the
reverse
of
imposing
it
stood
at
the
angle
of
king
road
and
ship
street
and
a
chemist
shop
occupied
the
whole
of
the
frontage
the
being
in
ship
street
its
architecture
was
fiat
and
plain
and
the
place
seemed
neglected
perhaps
unprosperous
twenty
murmured
george
cannon
and
then
smiled
at
himself
as
if
ashamed
of
his
own
naïveté
and
hilda
counted
the
windows
yes
there
were
eight
on
king
road
and
twelve
at
the
side
the
building
was
high
and
it
was
deep
stretching
far
down
ship
street
in
a
moment
it
began
to
put
on
for
hilda
quite
special
qualities
how
high
it
was
how
deep
it
was
and
in
what
a
situation
it
possessed
mysterious
and
fine
characteristics
which
set
it
apart
strange
that
hitherto
she
had
been
so
blind
to
it
she
and
george
cannon
were
divided
from
the
house
by
the
confused
and
noisy
traffic
of
the
roadway
and
by
the
streaming
throngs
on
the
opposite
pavement
and
none
of
these
people
riding
or
driving
or
walking
and
none
of
the
people
pushing
past
them
on
the
pavement
behind
guessed
that
here
on
the
kerb
was
the
future
master
of
the
chichester
an
amazing
man
and
that
she
hilda
lessways
by
his
side
was
the
woman
to
whom
he
had
chosen
first
to
relate
his
triumph
this
unrecognised
secrecy
in
the
great
animated
street
was
piquant
and
agreeable
to
hilda
a
source
of
pride
i
suppose
you
bought
it
she
ventured
she
had
no
notion
of
his
financial
resources
but
her
instinct
was
to
consider
them
infinite
no
i
not
exactly
bought
it
he
laughed
not
quite
i
got
the
lease
from
christmas
how
much
d
think
the
rent
is
he
seemed
to
challenge
her
oh
do
ask
me
five
hundred
a
year
he
said
and
raised
his
chin
five
hundred
a
year
ten
pounds
a
week
nearly
thirty
shillings
a
day
you
got
to
pay
that
before
you
can
even
begin
to
think
of
your
own
profits
but
it
enormous
hilda
was
staggered
all
her
mother
houses
put
together
had
brought
in
scarcely
a
third
of
the
rental
of
that
single
house
which
was
nevertheless
only
a
modest
unit
in
several
miles
of
houses
but
can
you
make
it
pay
i
fancy
so
else
i
should
have
taken
it
the
present
man
ca
but
then
he
paying
for
one
thing
and
he
old
and
he
does
know
his
business
oh
yes
i
think
i
can
see
my
money
back
wait
till
christmas
is
turned
and
i
make
a
start
she
knew
that
the
future
would
justify
his
how
he
succeeded
she
could
not
define
why
should
he
succeed
where
another
was
failing
he
could
not
go
out
and
drag
boarders
by
physical
force
into
his
private
hotel
yet
he
would
succeed
in
every
gesture
he
was
the
successful
man
she
looked
timidly
up
at
his
eyes
under
the
strong
black
eyelashes
his
glance
caught
hers
he
smiled
conqueringly
have
said
a
word
to
sarah
yet
he
almost
whispered
so
low
was
his
voice
and
he
put
on
a
smile
hilda
smiled
in
response
shall
you
keep
preston
street
she
asked
of
course
he
said
with
pride
i
shall
run
the
two
naturally
he
put
his
shoulders
back
one
will
help
the
other
do
you
see
she
thought
she
saw
and
nodded
appreciatively
he
meant
to
run
two
establishments
at
the
same
moment
a
young
and
stylish
man
drove
rather
slowly
by
in
a
high
he
nodded
carelessly
to
george
cannon
and
then
perceiving
that
george
cannon
was
with
a
lady
raised
his
hat
in
haste
george
cannon
responded
the
young
man
gazed
for
an
instant
hard
at
hilda
with
a
peculiar
expression
and
passed
on
she
did
not
know
who
he
was
of
george
cannon
relationships
in
the
town
she
was
entirely
ignorant
but
that
he
had
relationships
was
always
obvious
she
blushed
thinking
of
what
sarah
gailey
had
said
about
concerning
herself
and
george
cannon
in
the
young
man
glance
there
had
been
something
to
annoy
and
shame
her
come
across
and
have
a
look
at
the
place
said
george
cannon
suddenly
stepping
down
into
the
gutter
with
a
look
first
in
one
direction
and
then
in
the
other
for
threatening
traffic
i
do
think
i
come
now
she
replied
but
why
not
are
you
in
a
hurry
you
plenty
of
time
before
five
heaps
i
prefer
not
to
come
she
insisted
in
an
abashed
and
diffident
voice
but
what
up
he
demanded
stepping
back
to
the
pavement
and
glancing
directly
into
her
eyes
she
blushed
more
and
more
dropping
her
eyelids
i
do
want
to
be
talked
about
much
she
muttered
mortified
her
inference
was
unmistakable
the
whole
of
her
mind
seemed
now
to
be
occupied
with
an
enormous
grievance
which
she
somehow
had
against
the
world
in
general
her
very
soul
too
was
bursting
with
this
grievance
talked
about
but
who
never
mind
i
know
i
been
told
she
interrupted
him
oh
i
see
he
was
now
understanding
the
cause
of
her
trouble
in
sarah
gailey
bedroom
now
look
here
he
went
on
i
just
got
to
have
a
few
words
with
you
you
come
across
the
road
please
he
was
imperious
she
raised
her
glance
for
a
timid
moment
to
his
face
and
saw
to
her
intense
astonishment
that
he
also
was
blushing
never
before
had
she
seen
him
blush
come
along
he
urged
she
followed
him
obediently
across
the
dangerous
road
he
waited
for
her
at
the
opposite
kerb
and
then
they
went
up
ship
street
he
turned
into
the
entrance
of
the
chichester
which
was
grandiose
with
a
flight
of
shallow
steps
and
then
a
porch
with
two
basket
chairs
and
then
another
flight
of
shallow
steps
ending
in
double
doors
which
were
noticeably
higher
than
the
street
level
she
still
followed
nobody
in
here
i
expect
said
george
cannon
indicating
a
door
on
the
right
to
an
old
waiter
who
stood
in
the
dark
hall
no
sir
george
cannon
opened
the
door
as
a
master
ushered
hilda
into
a
tiny
room
furnished
with
a
desk
and
two
chairs
and
shut
the
door
iii
the
small
window
was
of
ground
glass
and
gave
no
prospect
of
the
outer
world
from
which
it
seemed
to
hilda
that
she
was
as
completely
cut
off
as
in
a
prison
she
was
alone
with
george
cannon
and
beyond
the
narrow
walls
which
caged
them
together
and
close
together
there
was
nothing
all
brighton
save
this
room
had
ceased
to
exist
hilda
was
now
more
than
ever
affrighted
shamed
perturbed
agonised
yet
at
the
same
time
she
had
the
desperate
calm
of
the
captain
of
a
ship
about
to
founder
with
all
hands
and
she
saw
glimpses
beautiful
and
compensatory
of
the
romantic
quality
of
common
life
she
was
in
a
little
office
of
a
perfectly
ordinary
she
could
even
detect
the
stale
odours
of
cooking
with
a
realistic
man
of
business
and
they
were
about
to
discuss
a
perfectly
ordinary
piece
of
scandal
and
surely
they
might
be
called
two
people
and
withal
the
ordinariness
and
the
midland
gumption
of
the
scene
were
shot
through
with
the
bright
exotic
rays
of
romance
she
thought
it
is
painful
and
humiliating
to
be
caught
and
fixed
as
i
am
but
it
is
wonderful
too
the
fact
is
said
george
cannon
in
an
easy
reassuring
tone
we
never
get
the
chance
of
a
bit
of
quiet
chat
upon
my
soul
we
do
now
i
suppose
it
sarah
who
been
worrying
you
yes
what
did
she
say
you
better
sit
down
do
you
think
he
swung
round
the
pivoted
in
front
of
the
closed
desk
and
pointed
her
to
it
oh
hilda
hesitated
and
then
sank
on
to
the
chair
without
looking
at
it
she
simply
said
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
about
you
and
me
has
she
been
saying
anything
to
you
he
shook
his
head
staring
down
at
her
hilda
put
her
arms
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
and
shirking
the
man
gaze
stared
down
at
the
worn
carpet
and
at
his
boots
thereon
one
instinct
in
her
desired
that
he
should
move
away
or
that
the
room
should
be
larger
but
another
instinct
wanted
him
to
remain
close
lest
the
savour
of
life
should
lose
its
sharpness
it
passes
me
how
people
can
say
such
things
she
went
on
in
a
low
thrilled
meditative
voice
i
ca
understand
it
she
was
quite
sincere
in
her
astonished
indignation
nevertheless
she
experienced
a
positive
pride
at
being
brought
into
a
scandal
with
george
cannon
she
derived
from
it
a
certain
feeling
of
importance
it
proved
that
she
was
no
longer
a
mere
girlish
miss
george
cannon
kept
silence
i
shall
leave
brighton
hilda
continued
that
i
quite
decided
i
do
like
leaving
your
sister
as
ill
as
she
is
but
really
and
she
thought
how
prudent
she
was
and
how
capable
of
taking
care
of
herself
she
all
alone
in
the
world
where
should
you
go
to
bursley
the
orgreaves
george
cannon
asked
absently
and
carelessly
i
do
know
said
hilda
with
curtness
he
stepped
aside
in
the
direction
of
the
window
and
examined
curiously
the
surface
of
the
glass
as
though
in
search
of
a
concealed
message
which
it
might
contain
in
a
new
and
much
more
animated
voice
he
said
to
the
window
of
course
i
know
it
all
my
fault
hilda
glanced
up
at
his
back
he
was
still
not
more
than
three
feet
away
from
her
how
is
it
your
fault
she
asked
after
a
pause
he
made
another
pause
the
way
i
look
at
you
he
said
these
apparently
simple
words
made
hilda
tremble
and
deprived
her
of
speech
they
shifted
the
conversation
to
another
plane
way
i
look
at
you
the
way
i
look
at
you
what
did
he
mean
how
did
he
look
at
her
she
could
not
imagine
what
he
was
driving
at
yes
she
could
she
knew
quite
well
all
the
time
while
pretending
to
herself
not
to
understand
she
understood
it
was
staggering
but
she
perfectly
understood
he
had
looked
at
her
that
on
the
very
first
day
of
their
acquaintance
in
his
office
at
turnhill
and
again
at
the
house
in
lessways
street
and
again
in
the
newspaper
office
and
on
other
occasions
and
again
on
the
night
of
their
arrival
at
brighton
but
surely
not
lately
or
did
he
look
at
her
that
behind
her
back
was
it
possible
that
people
noticed
it
absurd
his
explanation
of
the
origin
of
the
gossip
did
not
convince
her
she
had
however
suddenly
lost
interest
in
the
origin
of
the
gossip
she
was
entirely
occupied
with
george
cannon
tone
and
his
calm
audacious
reference
to
a
phenomenon
which
had
hitherto
seemed
to
her
to
be
far
beyond
the
region
of
words
she
was
frightened
she
was
like
some
one
walking
secure
in
the
night
who
is
stopped
by
the
sound
of
rushing
water
and
stands
with
all
his
senses
astrain
afraid
to
move
a
step
farther
too
absorbed
and
intimidated
to
be
aware
of
astonishment
the
point
was
not
whether
or
not
she
had
known
or
guessed
the
existence
of
this
unseen
and
formidable
river
the
point
was
that
she
was
thrillingly
on
its
brink
in
the
dark
every
instant
she
heard
its
swelling
current
plainer
and
plainer
she
thought
am
i
lost
how
strange
that
this
awful
and
exquisite
thing
should
happen
to
just
me
she
was
quite
fatalistic
he
turned
his
head
suddenly
and
caught
her
guilty
eyes
for
an
instant
before
she
could
lower
them
you
do
mean
to
say
you
do
know
what
i
mean
he
said
she
still
could
not
speak
her
trouble
was
acute
her
far
keener
than
it
had
ever
been
before
she
thought
but
impossible
that
this
awful
and
exquisite
thing
should
happen
in
this
fashion
george
cannon
moved
a
step
towards
her
she
could
not
see
his
face
but
she
knew
that
he
was
looking
at
her
with
his
expression
at
once
tyrannic
and
benevolent
she
could
feel
beating
upon
her
the
emanating
waves
of
his
personality
and
she
was
as
confused
as
though
she
had
been
sitting
naked
in
front
of
him
and
he
had
brought
all
this
about
by
simply
putting
something
into
words
by
saying
it
the
way
i
look
at
you
he
went
on
i
ca
help
it
you
know
the
very
first
minute
i
ever
set
eyes
on
you
of
course
i
but
there
it
is
i
never
seen
any
one
like
you
and
i
seen
a
few
the
fact
is
hilda
i
do
believe
you
do
know
how
fine
you
are
he
spoke
more
quickly
and
with
boyish
enthusiasm
his
voice
became
wonderfully
persuasive
you
are
fine
you
know
and
you
beautiful
i
did
think
so
at
first
but
you
are
you
being
wasted
why
a
woman
like
you
you
no
idea
you
so
proud
and
stiff
when
you
want
to
be
i
trust
you
with
anything
you
absolutely
the
only
woman
i
ever
met
that
i
trust
like
a
man
and
that
a
fact
now
nobody
could
ever
think
as
much
of
you
as
i
do
i
quite
certain
of
it
it
could
be
done
i
you
you
see
i
understand
everything
you
do
and
whatever
you
do
it
just
fine
for
me
you
could
be
as
happy
with
any
one
else
you
could
i
feel
that
in
my
bones
now
now
i
must
tell
you
something
the
praise
the
sympathy
the
passion
were
astounding
marvellous
and
delicious
to
her
was
it
conceivable
that
this
experienced
and
worldly
man
had
been
captivated
by
such
a
mere
girl
as
herself
she
had
never
guessed
it
or
had
she
always
guessed
it
an
intense
pride
warmed
her
blood
like
a
powerful
cordial
life
was
even
grander
than
she
had
thought
she
drooped
into
an
intoxication
among
all
that
he
had
said
he
had
not
said
that
he
was
not
stronger
than
she
he
had
not
relinquished
his
authority
she
felt
it
sitting
almost
beneath
him
in
the
slippery
chair
she
knew
that
she
would
yield
to
him
she
desired
to
yield
to
him
her
mind
was
full
of
sensuous
images
based
on
the
abdication
of
her
will
in
favour
of
his
now
look
here
hilda
i
want
to
tell
you
he
perhaps
did
not
intend
that
she
should
look
up
but
she
looked
up
and
she
was
surprised
to
see
that
his
face
was
full
of
troubled
hesitations
showing
almost
dismay
he
made
the
motion
of
swallowing
she
smiled
and
set
her
shoulders
back
the
very
gesture
that
she
had
learned
from
him
what
she
questioned
in
a
whisper
her
brief
mood
of
courage
was
over
she
sank
before
him
again
and
waited
with
bowed
head
profoundly
disturbed
he
stood
quite
still
for
a
few
seconds
with
shut
lips
and
then
he
made
another
step
to
approach
your
name
got
to
be
cannon
she
heard
him
say
she
thought
still
waiting
if
this
goes
on
a
moment
longer
i
shall
die
of
anticipation
in
bliss
and
when
she
felt
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
the
great
shadow
of
him
on
part
of
her
face
her
body
seemed
to
sigh
acquiescent
and
for
the
moment
assuaged
this
is
a
miracle
and
life
is
miraculous
she
acknowledged
that
she
had
lacked
faith
in
life
she
was
now
on
the
river
whirling
but
at
the
same
time
she
was
in
the
small
hot
room
and
both
george
cannon
hands
were
on
her
unresisting
shoulders
and
then
they
were
round
her
and
she
felt
his
physical
nearness
the
texture
of
his
coat
and
of
his
skin
she
could
see
in
a
mist
the
separate
hairs
of
his
tremendous
moustache
and
the
colours
swimming
in
his
eyes
her
nostrils
expanded
in
transient
alarm
to
a
faint
exciting
masculine
odour
she
was
disconcerted
if
not
by
the
violence
of
his
first
kiss
but
her
consternation
was
delectable
to
her
and
amid
her
fright
and
her
joy
and
the
wonder
of
her
extreme
surprise
and
the
preoccupation
of
being
whirled
down
the
river
she
calmly
reflected
somewhere
in
her
brain
the
door
is
not
locked
supposing
some
one
were
to
come
in
and
see
us
and
she
reflected
also
in
an
ecstasy
of
relief
my
life
will
be
quite
simple
now
i
shall
have
nothing
to
worry
about
and
i
can
help
him
for
during
a
year
past
she
had
never
ceased
to
ask
herself
what
she
must
do
to
arrange
her
life
her
conscience
had
never
ceased
to
tell
her
that
she
ought
not
to
be
content
to
remain
in
the
narrow
ideas
of
her
mother
and
that
though
she
preferred
marriage
she
ought
to
act
independently
of
the
hope
of
it
throughout
her
long
stay
in
preston
street
she
had
continually
said
after
this
what
this
can
not
last
for
ever
when
it
comes
to
an
end
what
am
i
to
do
to
satisfy
my
conscience
and
she
had
thought
vaguely
of
magnificent
activities
and
purposes
she
knew
not
what
the
problem
existed
no
more
her
life
was
arranged
and
now
far
more
sincerely
than
in
the
king
road
twenty
minutes
earlier
she
regarded
the
career
of
a
spinster
with
horror
and
with
scorn
at
best
she
suddenly
perceived
with
blinding
clearness
it
would
have
been
pitiful
pitiful
twenty
minutes
earlier
in
the
king
road
she
had
dreamt
of
belonging
absolutely
to
some
man
of
being
at
his
disposal
of
being
under
his
might
of
being
helpless
before
him
and
now
miracle
thrice
miraculous
miracle
unconceived
inconceivable
no
more
now
she
told
herself
how
admirable
was
the
man
she
assured
herself
that
he
was
entirely
admirable
she
reminded
herself
that
she
had
always
deemed
him
admirable
that
only
twenty
minutes
earlier
in
the
king
road
when
there
was
in
her
mind
no
dimmest
wildest
notion
of
the
real
future
she
had
genuinely
admired
him
how
clever
how
tactful
how
indomitable
how
conquering
how
generous
how
kind
he
was
how
kind
to
his
how
forbearing
with
her
indeed
she
could
not
recall
his
faults
and
he
was
inevitably
destined
to
brilliant
success
she
would
be
the
wife
of
a
great
and
a
wealthy
man
and
in
her
own
secret
ways
she
could
influence
him
and
thus
be
greater
than
the
great
love
it
is
an
absolute
fact
that
the
name
of
did
not
in
the
first
eternal
moments
even
occur
to
her
and
when
it
did
she
gave
it
but
little
importance
she
had
to
admit
that
she
had
not
consciously
thought
of
george
cannon
with
love
at
any
rate
with
love
as
she
had
imagined
love
to
be
indeed
her
immediate
experience
would
not
fit
any
theory
that
she
could
formulate
but
with
the
inexorable
realism
of
her
sex
she
easily
dismissed
inconvenient
names
and
theories
and
accommodated
herself
to
the
fact
and
the
fact
was
that
she
overwhelmingly
wanted
george
cannon
and
as
she
now
recognized
had
wanted
him
ever
since
she
first
saw
him
the
recognition
afforded
her
intense
pleasure
she
abandoned
herself
candidly
to
this
luxury
of
an
unknown
desire
it
was
incomparably
the
most
splendid
and
dangerous
experience
that
she
had
ever
had
she
did
not
reason
and
she
had
no
wish
to
reason
she
was
set
above
reason
happy
to
the
point
of
delicious
pain
she
yet
yearned
forward
to
a
happiness
far
more
excruciating
she
was
perfectly
aware
that
her
bliss
would
be
torment
until
george
cannon
had
married
her
until
she
had
wholly
surrendered
to
him
yet
at
intervals
a
voice
said
very
clearly
within
her
all
this
is
wrong
this
is
base
and
shameful
this
is
something
to
blush
for
really
she
did
blush
but
her
blushes
were
a
part
of
the
delight
and
the
voice
was
not
persistent
she
could
silence
it
with
scarcely
an
effort
despite
its
clarity
kiss
me
george
cannon
demanded
of
her
with
eager
masterfulness
the
request
shocked
her
for
an
instant
and
the
young
girl
in
her
was
about
to
revolt
but
she
kissed
him
an
act
which
combined
the
sweetness
of
submission
with
the
glory
of
triumph
she
looked
at
him
steadily
confident
in
herself
and
in
him
she
felt
that
he
knew
how
to
love
his
emotion
filled
her
with
superb
pride
she
seemed
to
be
saying
to
him
in
a
doomed
rapture
do
you
think
i
do
know
what
i
am
doing
i
know
i
know
the
current
of
the
river
was
tremendous
she
foresaw
the
probability
of
disaster
she
was
aware
that
she
had
definitely
challenged
the
hazard
of
fate
but
she
was
not
terrified
in
the
dark
swirling
night
of
her
destiny
she
straightened
her
shoulders
with
all
her
innocence
and
ignorance
and
impulsiveness
and
weakness
she
had
behind
her
the
unique
and
priceless
force
of
her
youth
she
was
young
and
she
put
her
trust
in
life
chapter
iii
florrie
again
i
as
they
were
walking
home
along
the
king
road
hilda
suddenly
stopped
in
front
of
a
chemist
shop
i
got
something
to
buy
here
she
said
diffidently
and
then
added
i
follow
you
and
what
have
you
got
to
buy
he
asked
facing
her
with
his
benevolent
ironical
expression
never
mind
she
gently
laughed
i
sha
be
many
minutes
after
you
she
pretended
to
make
a
mystery
but
her
sole
purpose
was
to
avoid
the
house
in
his
company
and
she
knew
that
he
had
divined
this
nevertheless
she
found
pleasure
in
the
perfectly
futile
pretence
of
a
mysterious
purchase
she
was
very
as
they
stood
there
on
the
dusty
footpath
amid
the
promenaders
gay
and
gloomy
chattering
and
silent
who
were
taking
the
sun
and
the
salt
breeze
despite
her
reason
she
had
a
fear
that
numbers
of
people
would
perceive
her
to
be
newly
affianced
and
remark
upon
the
contrast
between
her
girlishness
and
his
maturity
but
george
cannon
was
not
in
the
slightest
degree
he
played
the
lover
with
ease
and
said
quite
simply
and
convincingly
just
the
things
which
she
would
have
expected
a
lover
to
say
indeed
the
conversation
as
carried
on
by
him
between
the
moment
of
betrothal
and
the
arrival
at
the
chemist
shop
was
the
one
phenomenon
of
the
engagement
which
corresponded
with
her
preconceived
ideas
concerning
such
an
affair
it
convinced
her
that
she
really
was
affianced
well
he
murmured
fondly
and
yet
quizzically
as
they
remained
wordless
deliciously
hesitating
to
part
what
are
you
thinking
about
she
replied
with
brave
candour
appealing
to
him
by
a
soft
glance
i
was
only
thinking
how
queer
it
is
i
should
be
engaged
in
a
room
never
seen
before
in
my
life
going
into
it
like
that
he
looked
at
her
uncomprehending
for
an
instant
his
features
were
blank
then
he
smiled
kindly
it
so
strange
she
encouraged
him
yes
is
it
he
agreed
with
charming
tranquil
politeness
he
does
see
it
she
thought
as
she
watched
the
play
of
his
face
he
does
see
how
wonderful
it
is
that
i
should
go
into
a
room
that
was
absolutely
unknown
to
me
and
then
this
should
happen
at
once
why
i
never
knew
there
was
such
a
room
she
could
not
define
how
she
was
affected
by
this
fact
but
she
regarded
the
fact
as
tremendously
romantic
and
its
effect
on
her
was
profound
and
george
saw
in
it
no
significance
she
was
disconcerted
she
felt
a
tremor
it
was
as
though
the
entire
king
road
had
quivered
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
and
then
feigning
nonchalance
resumed
its
moveless
solidity
inside
the
chemist
she
demanded
the
first
thing
she
set
eyes
on
a
all
the
while
she
was
examining
various
shapes
of
toothbrushes
she
had
a
vision
of
george
raising
his
hat
to
take
leave
of
her
and
she
could
see
not
only
the
curve
of
his
hand
and
the
whiteness
of
his
cuff
but
also
the
millions
of
tiny
marks
and
creases
on
the
coarse
skin
of
his
face
extraordinarily
different
from
her
own
smooth
pure
delicate
silky
complexion
and
she
remembered
that
less
than
three
years
ago
she
had
regarded
him
as
of
another
generation
as
indefinitely
older
and
infinitely
more
experienced
than
her
childish
and
simple
self
this
reflection
produced
in
her
a
consternation
which
was
curiously
blissful
no
madam
the
chemist
was
saying
it
this
size
that
we
usually
sell
to
ladies
she
put
on
the
serious
judicial
air
of
an
authentic
adult
woman
and
frowned
at
the
chemist
ii
when
in
preston
street
she
was
reluctantly
approaching
the
house
she
saw
a
cab
coming
downwards
in
the
opposite
direction
stop
at
no
that
must
be
florrie
she
said
the
being
in
need
of
another
servant
young
strong
and
reliable
hilda
had
suggested
that
miss
florence
bagster
might
be
invited
to
accept
the
situation
sarah
gailey
had
agreed
that
it
would
be
wise
to
have
a
servant
from
turnhill
she
mistrusted
southern
servants
and
appeared
to
believe
that
there
was
no
real
honesty
south
of
the
trent
florence
bagster
had
accepted
the
situation
with
enthusiasm
writing
that
she
longed
to
be
again
with
her
former
mistress
she
did
not
write
that
the
mysterious
and
magnetic
name
of
brighton
called
her
more
loudly
than
the
name
of
her
former
mistress
and
now
florence
was
due
but
it
was
not
florence
who
emerged
from
the
cab
it
was
a
tall
and
young
lady
in
a
gay
costume
and
gloves
and
a
sunshade
and
a
striking
hat
this
young
lady
stood
by
the
cab
expectant
and
smiling
while
the
cabman
pulled
a
tin
trunk
off
the
roof
of
the
vehicle
and
then
when
the
cabman
had
climbed
down
and
was
dragging
the
trunk
after
him
she
put
out
an
arm
and
seized
one
handle
of
the
trunk
to
help
him
which
act
so
strange
on
the
part
of
a
young
lady
made
hilda
coming
nearer
and
nearer
look
more
carefully
she
was
astounded
as
she
realized
that
the
unknown
young
lady
was
not
a
young
lady
after
all
but
the
familiar
florrie
at
the
advanced
age
of
sixteen
the
aged
cabman
had
made
no
mistake
he
left
the
tin
trunk
on
the
pavement
and
took
timid
florrie
money
without
touching
his
hat
for
it
florrie
was
laying
her
sunshade
rather
forlornly
on
the
top
of
the
tin
trunk
and
preparing
to
lift
the
trunk
unaided
when
boutwood
stout
and
all
in
black
came
gallantly
forth
from
the
house
to
assist
her
sarah
gailey
opposition
had
not
been
persistent
enough
to
keep
the
jovial
boutwood
out
of
no
shortly
after
christmas
his
wife
had
died
suddenly
and
boutwood
with
plenty
of
time
and
plenty
of
money
on
his
hands
had
found
himself
desolated
in
his
desolation
he
had
sought
his
old
acquaintance
george
cannon
and
the
result
had
somehow
been
that
bygones
had
become
bygones
and
a
new
boarder
had
increased
the
prosperity
of
no
sarah
gailey
could
not
object
indeed
she
had
actually
wept
for
the
death
of
one
enemy
and
the
affliction
of
another
moreover
she
seldom
had
contact
with
the
boarders
now
the
rather
peculiar
circumstances
of
florrie
arrival
almost
cured
hilda
and
she
entered
the
house
in
the
wake
of
the
trunk
with
a
certain
forgetful
ease
there
was
boutwood
still
dallying
with
florrie
and
the
trunk
in
the
narrow
hall
the
shocking
phenomenon
of
a
boarder
helping
a
domestic
servant
with
her
luggage
had
been
rendered
possible
only
by
a
series
of
accidents
the
front
door
being
left
open
on
account
of
the
weather
boutwood
had
had
a
direct
view
of
the
maiden
and
the
maiden
had
not
been
obliged
to
announce
her
arrival
officially
by
ringing
a
bell
hence
the
other
servants
had
not
had
notice
and
of
the
overseers
of
the
house
one
was
imprisoned
in
the
basement
and
the
other
two
had
been
out
betrothing
themselves
in
the
ordinary
way
the
slightest
unusualness
in
the
hall
would
instantly
attract
the
attention
of
somebody
in
authority
boutwood
was
not
immediately
aware
of
hilda
his
attitude
towards
florrie
was
shocking
to
hilda
in
a
double
sense
it
shocked
her
as
an
overseer
but
it
shocked
her
quite
as
much
as
a
young
woman
newly
jealous
for
the
pride
of
all
her
sex
florrie
was
beyond
question
exceedingly
pretty
in
particular
the
chin
pouted
more
deliriously
than
ever
her
complexion
was
even
finer
than
hilda
own
she
had
a
simple
glance
a
quick
and
extraordinarily
seductive
smile
and
the
unique
bodily
grace
of
her
years
her
costume
though
vulgar
and
very
was
effective
at
a
little
distance
her
form
and
movements
gave
it
a
fictitious
worth
indeed
she
was
an
amazing
blossom
to
have
come
off
the
dunghill
of
calder
street
domestic
drudgery
had
not
yet
dehumanized
nor
disfigured
her
it
is
true
that
her
hands
were
concealed
in
gloves
and
her
feet
beneath
a
flowing
skirt
now
boutwood
attitude
showed
very
plainly
that
the
girlish
charms
of
florrie
had
produced
in
him
a
definite
and
familiar
effect
he
would
have
been
ready
to
commit
follies
for
the
young
woman
and
to
deny
that
she
was
a
drudge
or
anything
but
a
beautiful
creature
hilda
objected
she
objected
because
boutwood
was
a
widower
holding
that
he
had
no
right
to
joy
and
that
he
ought
to
mourn
practically
for
ever
in
solitude
she
would
make
no
allowance
for
his
human
instincts
his
needs
of
intimate
companionship
his
enormous
unoccupied
leisure
she
would
have
condemned
him
utterly
on
the
score
of
his
widowhood
alone
but
she
objected
far
more
strongly
to
his
attitude
because
he
was
fat
and
looked
somewhat
coarse
she
counted
his
obesity
to
him
for
a
sin
and
it
was
naught
to
her
that
he
had
been
a
martyr
to
idleness
and
wealth
which
combination
had
prematurely
aged
him
boutwood
was
really
younger
than
george
cannon
and
florence
bagster
certainly
seemed
as
old
as
hilda
yet
the
juxtaposition
of
the
young
slim
and
virginal
florrie
and
the
large
boutwood
profoundly
offended
her
it
was
boutwood
who
first
discovered
that
hilda
was
in
the
doorway
he
was
immediately
abashed
and
presented
the
most
foolish
appearance
whereupon
hilda
added
scorn
to
her
disgust
florrie
however
easily
kept
her
countenance
and
with
a
pert
smile
took
the
hand
which
her
former
mistress
graciously
extended
by
universal
custom
a
servant
retains
some
of
the
privileges
of
humanity
for
several
minutes
after
entering
upon
a
new
servitude
boutwood
vanished
louisa
will
help
you
upstairs
with
the
trunk
said
hilda
when
she
had
made
inquiries
about
the
wonderful
journey
which
florrie
had
accomplished
alone
and
about
the
health
of
florrie
aunt
and
of
her
family
louisa
she
called
loudly
up
the
stairs
and
down
into
the
basement
iii
she
followed
the
procession
of
the
trunk
upstairs
and
louisa
having
descended
again
showed
florrie
into
the
kennel
this
tiny
apartment
had
in
it
two
and
a
on
a
chair
and
little
else
a
very
small
square
in
the
low
ceiling
procured
a
dusky
light
in
the
middle
hours
of
the
day
florence
seemed
delighted
with
the
room
she
might
have
had
to
sleep
under
the
stairs
put
on
your
afternoon
apron
and
then
you
can
go
down
and
see
miss
gailey
said
hilda
and
shut
the
door
upon
florrie
in
her
new
home
when
she
turned
there
was
george
cannon
on
the
beneath
the
skylight
she
knew
not
how
he
had
come
there
nor
whether
he
had
entered
the
house
before
or
after
herself
i
glad
he
is
fat
she
thought
and
it
was
as
though
she
had
thought
if
he
were
fat
everything
would
be
different
her
features
did
not
relax
as
she
went
down
the
five
steps
to
the
where
he
waited
smiling
faintly
she
thought
we
must
be
very
serious
and
circumspect
in
the
house
there
must
never
be
the
slightest
but
while
she
was
yet
on
the
last
step
he
firmly
put
his
hands
on
her
ears
and
drawing
her
head
towards
him
kissed
her
full
on
the
mouth
and
she
saw
again
through
her
eyelashes
all
the
details
of
his
face
she
yielded
all
her
ideas
of
circumspection
melted
magically
away
in
an
abandoned
tenderness
of
which
she
was
ashamed
but
for
which
she
would
have
unreflectingly
made
any
sacrifice
the
embrace
was
over
in
an
instant
besides
being
guiltless
of
obesity
george
cannon
was
free
from
the
unpardonable
fault
of
clumsiness
he
was
audacious
but
he
was
not
foolhardy
and
he
would
never
be
abashed
true
she
had
seen
dismay
on
his
face
at
the
moment
of
his
declaration
but
that
moment
was
unique
and
his
dismay
had
ineffably
flattered
her
now
on
the
she
was
drenched
in
bliss
and
she
felt
dissolute
she
felt
even
base
but
she
did
not
care
she
thought
as
it
were
startled
this
is
love
this
must
be
what
love
is
i
must
have
been
in
love
without
knowing
it
and
as
for
a
girl
always
knowing
when
a
man
in
love
with
her
and
foreseeing
the
proposal
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
her
practical
contempt
for
all
that
sort
of
thing
could
not
be
stated
in
words
florrie
just
come
she
whispered
and
by
a
movement
of
the
head
indicated
that
florrie
was
in
the
kennel
they
went
together
to
the
on
the
first
floor
it
was
empty
the
entire
population
of
the
being
still
on
the
seashore
hilda
stood
near
the
door
which
she
left
open
and
gave
detailed
news
of
florrie
in
a
tone
very
there
was
no
reference
to
love
or
to
the
new
situation
created
or
to
the
vast
enterprise
of
the
chichester
the
topic
was
florrie
and
somehow
it
held
the
field
despite
efforts
to
dislodge
it
then
the
stairs
creaked
already
florrie
was
coming
down
in
a
trice
she
had
made
herself
ready
for
work
she
came
down
timidly
not
daring
to
look
to
right
nor
left
but
concentrating
her
attention
on
the
stairs
she
passed
along
the
landing
outside
the
door
and
hilda
opening
the
door
a
little
wider
had
a
full
surreptitious
view
of
her
back
and
george
cannon
farther
within
the
room
also
saw
her
they
watched
her
disappear
on
her
way
to
find
the
basement
and
the
formidable
sarah
gailey
hilda
was
touched
by
the
spectacle
of
this
child
disguised
as
a
strapping
woman
far
removed
from
her
family
and
her
companions
and
her
familiar
haunts
and
driven
or
drawn
into
exile
at
brighton
where
she
would
only
see
the
sea
once
a
week
except
through
windows
and
where
she
would
have
to
work
from
fourteen
to
sixteen
hours
a
day
for
a
living
and
sleep
in
a
kennel
the
prettiness
the
pertness
and
the
naïve
contentedness
of
the
child
thus
realizing
an
ambition
touched
her
deeply
it
does
seem
a
shame
does
it
she
said
what
bringing
her
all
the
way
up
here
like
this
she
does
know
a
soul
in
brighton
she
bound
to
be
frightfully
what
about
you
george
cannon
interrupted
politely
does
she
know
you
he
smiled
with
all
his
kindness
yes
but
hilda
did
not
finish
it
was
not
worth
while
george
cannon
had
not
understood
he
did
not
feel
as
she
felt
and
her
emotion
was
incommunicable
to
him
a
tremendous
misgiving
seized
her
and
she
had
a
physical
feeling
of
emptiness
in
the
stomach
it
passed
swiftly
as
a
hallucination
just
such
a
misgiving
as
visits
nearly
every
normal
person
immediately
before
or
immediately
after
marriage
she
ignored
it
she
was
engaged
that
was
the
paramount
fact
she
was
engaged
and
joyously
determined
to
prosecute
the
grand
adventure
to
the
end
the
immensity
of
the
risks
forced
her
to
accept
them
iv
that
evening
sarah
gailey
was
in
torment
from
the
pain
in
her
wrists
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
she
had
had
the
doctor
and
no
article
of
the
prescribed
treatment
had
been
neglected
with
unaccustomed
aid
from
hilda
she
had
accomplished
the
business
of
undressing
and
getting
into
bed
and
now
she
sat
up
in
bed
supported
by
her
own
pillows
and
one
from
hilda
bed
and
nursed
her
wrists
while
hilda
poured
drops
of
a
narcotic
for
her
into
a
glass
of
water
apart
from
the
serious
local
symptoms
her
health
was
fairly
good
she
could
eat
she
could
talk
she
could
walk
and
her
brain
was
clear
hilda
held
the
glass
for
her
to
drink
for
it
was
prudent
to
keep
her
hands
as
much
as
possible
in
repose
there
said
hilda
as
if
to
a
young
child
who
had
been
querulous
sure
you
sleep
now
i
do
think
i
shall
the
sufferer
whined
oh
yes
you
will
hilda
insisted
firmly
although
she
was
by
no
means
sure
let
me
take
this
extra
pillow
away
and
then
you
can
lie
down
properly
she
was
thinking
reproachfully
what
a
pity
it
is
for
all
of
us
that
the
poor
thing
ca
bear
her
pain
with
a
little
less
fuss
it
was
not
sarah
alone
who
was
embittered
and
fatigued
by
sarah
pain
where
george
asked
the
invalid
when
she
was
laid
down
in
the
parlour
why
oh
nothing
by
the
way
said
hilda
seized
by
a
sudden
impulse
which
had
its
origin
in
sarah
tone
at
once
martyrized
and
accusing
by
the
way
who
it
that
been
talking
scandal
about
me
and
george
scandal
sarah
gailey
seemed
weakly
to
protest
against
the
word
because
if
you
want
to
know
hilda
continued
we
engaged
to
be
married
she
reflected
contrite
this
wo
help
her
to
sleep
and
then
added
in
a
new
endearing
accent
awaiting
an
outburst
of
some
kind
from
sarah
of
course
it
a
secret
dear
i
telling
no
one
but
you
after
a
moment
silence
sarah
remarked
casually
with
shut
eyes
it
be
much
the
best
not
to
tell
anyone
and
the
shorter
the
engagement
the
better
do
let
anybody
in
the
house
know
till
married
she
sighed
put
her
cheek
into
the
pillow
and
moved
her
bound
wrists
for
a
few
seconds
restlessly
if
you
turn
the
gas
down
she
finished
very
wearily
i
dare
say
i
may
get
off
if
only
they
stop
that
piano
upstairs
she
had
displayed
no
surprise
at
the
tremendous
event
no
sentimental
interest
in
it
the
fact
was
that
sarah
gailey
wrists
were
infinitely
more
interesting
to
her
than
any
conceivable
project
of
marriage
continuous
and
acute
pain
had
withdrawn
her
from
worldly
affairs
making
her
more
than
ever
like
a
god
hilda
was
startled
but
she
was
relieved
now
for
the
first
time
she
had
the
authentic
sensation
of
being
engaged
and
it
appeared
to
her
that
she
had
been
engaged
for
a
very
long
period
and
that
the
engagement
was
a
quite
ordinary
affair
she
was
relieved
yet
she
was
also
grievously
saddened
she
lowered
the
gas
and
in
the
gloom
gazed
for
a
few
seconds
at
the
vague
huddled
sheeted
faintly
moaning
figure
on
the
bed
the
untidy
grey
hair
against
the
pillow
struck
her
as
intolerably
pathetic
good
night
she
said
softly
and
the
feeble
plaintive
voice
responded
good
night
she
went
out
leaving
the
door
slightly
ajar
v
in
the
parlour
adjoining
george
cannon
was
seated
at
the
table
when
hilda
saw
him
and
their
eyes
met
she
was
comforted
a
wave
of
tenderness
seemed
to
agitate
her
she
realized
that
this
man
was
hers
and
the
realization
was
marvellously
reassuring
the
sound
of
the
piano
descended
delicately
from
the
as
from
a
great
distance
from
the
kitchen
came
the
muffled
clatter
of
earthenware
and
occasionally
a
harsh
loud
voice
it
was
the
hour
of
relaxed
discipline
in
the
kitchen
where
amid
the
final
and
much
free
discussion
and
banter
florrie
was
recommencing
her
career
on
a
grander
basis
hilda
closed
the
door
very
quietly
when
she
had
closed
it
and
was
shut
in
with
george
cannon
her
emotion
grew
intenser
i
think
she
get
off
now
she
whispered
standing
near
the
door
have
you
told
her
hilda
nodded
what
does
she
say
hilda
raised
her
eyebrows
oh
well
she
says
we
better
keep
it
quiet
and
make
the
engagement
as
short
as
possible
she
blushed
look
here
said
george
let
go
out
eh
but
what
will
people
say
what
the
devil
does
it
matter
what
they
say
i
want
you
to
come
out
with
me
the
whispered
oath
and
his
defiant
smile
enchanted
her
we
can
go
out
by
the
area
steps
he
continued
there
two
of
sitting
in
the
hall
but
the
front
door
shut
do
go
and
get
your
hat
she
left
the
room
with
an
obedient
smile
pushing
open
sarah
door
very
gently
she
groped
on
the
hooks
behind
it
for
her
hat
it
wo
matter
about
gloves
in
the
dark
she
thought
besides
i
must
disturb
her
before
the
door
she
looked
again
at
the
bed
there
was
neither
sound
nor
movement
probably
sarah
gailey
slept
the
dim
vision
of
the
form
on
the
bed
and
the
blue
spark
of
gas
in
the
corner
produced
in
hilda
a
mood
of
poignant
and
yet
delicious
sorrow
why
what
the
matter
george
cannon
asked
when
she
had
returned
to
the
parlour
she
knew
that
her
eyes
were
humid
with
tears
both
her
arms
were
raised
above
her
head
as
she
fixed
the
hat
this
act
of
fixing
the
hat
in
george
presence
gave
her
a
new
pleasure
she
smiled
at
him
nothing
she
said
whispering
mysteriously
i
think
she
gone
off
i
so
glad
you
know
she
really
does
suffer
dreadfully
his
look
was
uncomprehending
but
she
did
not
care
the
anticipation
of
going
out
with
him
was
now
utterly
absorbing
her
he
waited
with
his
hand
on
the
till
she
was
ready
and
then
he
lowered
the
gas
wait
a
moment
she
whispered
at
the
door
and
with
a
gesture
called
him
back
into
the
room
from
the
flagged
passage
leading
to
the
area
steps
on
the
desk
was
his
evening
glass
of
milk
which
he
drank
cold
in
summer
she
offered
it
to
him
in
the
twilit
room
like
an
enraptured
handmaid
he
had
forgotten
it
the
fact
that
he
had
forgotten
it
and
she
had
remembered
it
yet
further
increased
her
strange
mournful
ecstatic
bliss
have
some
he
whispered
when
he
had
drunk
she
finished
the
glass
trembling
they
went
forth
climbing
the
area
steps
with
proper
precautions
and
escaping
as
thieves
escape
down
the
street
for
an
instant
she
glimpsed
the
windows
of
the
and
the
from
behind
whose
illuminated
blinds
came
floating
as
it
were
wistfully
the
sound
of
song
and
chatter
she
thought
of
sarah
gailey
prone
and
unconscious
in
the
basement
and
she
felt
the
moisture
of
the
milk
on
her
lips
am
i
happy
or
unhappy
she
questioned
herself
and
could
not
reply
she
knew
only
that
she
was
thrillingly
smartingly
alive
at
the
corner
of
preston
street
and
king
road
a
landau
waited
this
is
ours
said
george
casually
ours
what
a
splendid
masculine
idea
how
it
proved
that
he
too
had
been
absorbed
in
the
adventure
she
admired
him
humbly
like
a
girl
like
a
little
girl
with
the
most
formal
deference
he
helped
her
into
the
carriage
drive
towards
shoreham
he
commandingly
directed
the
driver
and
took
his
place
by
her
side
yes
he
was
mature
he
was
a
man
of
the
world
he
had
had
every
experience
he
knew
how
to
love
that
such
a
being
was
hers
that
she
without
any
effort
had
captured
such
a
being
flattered
her
to
an
extreme
degree
she
was
glorious
with
pride
she
leaned
back
in
the
carriage
negligently
affecting
an
absolute
calm
she
armed
herself
in
her
virginity
not
george
cannon
himself
could
have
guessed
that
only
by
a
miracle
of
did
she
prevent
her
hand
from
seeking
his
beneath
the
light
rug
that
covered
their
knees
she
intimidated
george
cannon
in
that
hour
and
the
while
her
heart
burned
with
shame
at
the
secret
violence
of
her
feelings
she
thought
this
must
be
love
this
is
love
and
yet
her
conscience
inarticulately
accused
her
of
obliquity
but
she
did
not
care
and
she
would
not
reflect
she
thought
that
she
wilfully
perversely
refused
to
reflect
but
in
reality
she
was
quite
helpless
under
the
still
and
feverish
night
the
landau
rolled
slowly
along
between
the
invisible
murmuring
sea
and
the
lighted
facades
of
hove
occasionally
other
carriages
containing
other
couples
approached
were
plain
for
a
moment
and
dissolved
away
so
she
thinks
the
engagement
ought
to
be
short
said
george
cannon
yes
so
do
i
he
pronounced
with
emphasis
hilda
desired
to
ask
him
how
short
but
she
could
not
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
put
the
question
she
was
too
proud
by
a
short
engagement
did
he
mean
six
months
three
months
a
month
dared
she
hope
that
he
meant
a
month
this
was
a
thought
buried
in
the
deepest
fastness
of
her
soul
a
thought
that
she
would
have
perished
in
order
not
to
expose
but
it
existed
i
think
i
should
like
to
go
back
now
she
breathed
timidly
before
they
were
beyond
hove
it
was
not
a
request
to
be
ignored
the
carriage
turned
she
felt
relief
the
sensation
of
being
alive
had
been
too
acute
to
be
borne
and
it
was
now
a
little
eased
she
knew
that
her
destiny
was
irrevocable
that
nothing
could
prevent
her
from
being
george
cannon
whether
the
destiny
was
evil
or
good
did
not
paramountly
interest
her
but
she
wanted
to
rush
forward
into
the
arms
of
fate
and
know
her
fate
she
dreamed
only
of
the
union
book
v
her
deliverance
chapter
i
louisa
uncontrolled
i
hilda
after
a
long
railway
journey
was
bathing
her
face
arms
and
neck
at
the
large
double
washstand
in
the
large
double
bedroom
on
the
second
floor
of
no
preston
street
at
the
back
of
the
washstand
was
an
unused
door
which
gave
into
a
small
bedroom
occupied
by
the
youngest
miss
watchett
george
cannon
came
up
quietly
behind
her
she
pretended
not
to
hear
him
he
put
his
hands
lightly
on
her
wet
arms
smiling
with
condescending
indulgence
half
to
herself
she
still
pretended
to
ignore
him
and
continued
her
toilet
the
return
from
the
honeymoon
which
she
had
feared
had
accomplished
itself
quite
simply
and
easily
she
had
feared
the
return
because
only
upon
the
return
was
the
marriage
to
be
formally
acknowledged
and
published
it
had
been
obviously
impossible
to
announce
during
the
strenuous
summer
season
the
engagement
of
the
landlord
to
a
young
woman
who
lived
under
the
same
roof
with
him
the
consequences
of
such
an
indiscretion
would
have
been
in
various
ways
embarrassing
hence
not
a
word
was
said
nor
were
definite
plans
for
the
wedding
made
until
george
remarked
one
evening
that
he
would
like
to
be
married
at
chichester
chichester
being
the
name
of
his
new
private
hotel
which
exhibition
of
sentimentality
had
both
startled
and
touched
hilda
chichester
however
had
to
be
renounced
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
residence
the
subject
having
been
thus
fairly
broached
george
had
pursued
it
and
one
day
somewhat
casually
stated
that
he
had
taken
a
room
in
lewes
and
meant
to
sleep
there
every
night
for
the
term
imposed
by
the
law
less
than
three
weeks
later
hilda
had
inobtrusively
departed
from
no
the
official
account
being
that
she
was
to
take
a
holiday
with
friends
after
the
fatigues
of
august
and
early
september
she
left
the
train
at
lewes
and
there
in
the
presence
of
strangers
was
married
to
george
cannon
who
had
quitted
brighton
two
days
earlier
and
was
supposed
to
be
in
london
on
business
even
sarah
gailey
though
her
health
had
improved
did
not
assist
at
the
wedding
sarah
sole
depositary
of
the
secret
had
to
remain
in
charge
of
no
a
strange
wedding
not
a
single
wedding
present
except
those
interchanged
by
the
principals
nor
had
any
of
the
problems
raised
by
the
marriage
been
solved
or
attacked
the
future
of
sarah
gailey
for
example
was
sarah
to
go
on
living
with
them
it
was
inconceivable
and
yet
the
converse
was
also
inconceivable
sarah
had
said
nothing
and
nothing
had
been
said
to
sarah
matters
were
to
settle
themselves
it
had
not
even
been
decided
which
room
and
cannon
should
inhabit
as
man
and
wife
it
was
almost
certain
that
in
the
dead
period
between
the
popular
summer
season
and
the
fashionable
autumn
season
there
would
be
several
bedrooms
empty
hilda
like
george
did
not
want
to
bother
with
a
lot
of
tedious
details
important
or
unimportant
the
attitude
of
each
was
let
me
get
married
first
and
then
i
see
to
all
that
thus
had
the
return
been
formidable
to
hilda
all
the
way
from
ireland
she
had
been
saying
to
herself
i
shall
have
to
go
up
the
steps
and
into
the
house
and
be
spoken
to
as
cannon
and
then
there
be
sarah
but
the
entry
into
the
house
had
produced
no
terror
everywhere
george
adroitness
had
been
wonderful
extraordinarily
comforting
and
reassuring
and
nowhere
more
so
than
in
the
vestibule
of
no
the
tone
in
which
he
had
said
to
louisa
take
handbag
louisa
had
been
a
marvel
of
ease
louisa
had
incontestably
blenched
for
the
bizarre
sarah
who
conserved
in
brighton
the
inmost
spirit
of
the
five
towns
had
thought
fit
to
tell
the
servants
nothing
whatever
but
the
trained
veteran
in
louisa
had
instantly
recovered
and
she
had
replied
yes
sir
with
a
simplicity
which
proved
her
to
be
the
equal
of
george
cannon
the
worst
was
over
for
hilda
and
the
next
moments
were
made
smooth
by
reason
of
a
great
piece
of
news
which
forcing
sarah
gailey
to
communicate
it
at
once
monopolized
attention
and
so
entirely
relieved
the
bride
florence
bagster
having
insolently
quarrelled
with
her
mistress
had
left
her
service
without
notice
boutwood
had
also
gone
and
the
connection
between
the
two
departures
was
only
too
apparent
not
merely
to
sarah
but
also
to
the
three
miss
watchetts
who
had
recently
arrived
florence
who
could
but
whisper
had
shouted
at
her
mistress
little
flushing
modest
florrie
who
yesterday
in
the
five
towns
was
an
infant
had
compromised
herself
with
a
fat
widower
certainly
old
enough
to
be
her
father
and
the
widower
the
friend
of
the
house
had
had
so
little
regard
for
the
feelings
of
the
house
that
he
had
not
hesitated
to
flaunt
with
florrie
in
the
town
it
was
known
that
they
were
more
or
less
together
and
that
he
stood
between
florrie
and
the
world
ii
i
suppose
i
better
write
at
once
to
her
mother
or
perhaps
her
aunt
her
aunt
got
more
sense
said
hilda
as
she
dropped
the
sponge
and
groped
for
a
towel
her
eyes
half
blinded
in
moving
she
had
escaped
from
his
hands
what
do
you
say
she
asked
having
heard
a
vague
murmur
through
the
towel
i
say
you
can
write
if
you
like
george
spoke
with
a
careless
smile
now
facing
her
he
put
his
hands
on
her
damp
shoulders
she
looked
up
at
him
over
the
towel
leaning
her
head
forward
and
suspending
action
her
nose
was
about
a
foot
from
his
she
saw
as
she
had
seen
a
hundred
times
every
detail
of
his
large
handsome
and
yet
face
every
hair
of
his
impressive
moustache
all
the
melting
shades
of
colour
in
his
dark
eyes
his
charm
was
coarse
and
crude
but
he
was
very
skilful
and
there
was
something
about
his
experienced
slightly
depraved
air
which
excited
her
she
liked
to
feel
young
and
girlish
before
him
she
liked
to
feel
that
with
him
alone
of
all
men
her
modesty
availed
nothing
she
was
beginning
to
realize
her
power
over
him
and
the
extent
of
it
it
was
a
power
miraculous
and
mysterious
never
claimed
by
her
and
never
admitted
by
him
save
in
glance
and
gesture
this
power
lay
in
the
fact
that
she
was
indispensable
to
him
he
was
not
her
slave
she
might
indeed
have
been
considered
the
human
chattel
but
he
was
the
slave
of
his
need
of
her
he
loved
her
in
him
she
saw
what
love
was
she
had
seen
it
more
and
more
clearly
ever
since
the
day
of
their
engagement
she
was
both
proud
and
ashamed
of
her
power
he
did
not
possess
a
similar
power
over
herself
she
was
fond
of
him
perhaps
getting
fonder
but
his
domination
of
her
senses
was
already
nearly
at
an
end
she
had
passed
through
painful
shattering
ecstasies
of
bliss
hours
unforgettable
hours
which
she
knew
could
never
recur
and
she
was
left
sated
and
unsatisfied
so
that
by
virtue
of
this
not
yet
quite
bitter
disillusion
she
was
coming
to
regard
herself
as
his
superior
as
being
less
naïve
than
he
as
being
even
essentially
older
than
he
and
in
speaking
to
him
sometimes
she
would
put
on
a
grave
and
precociously
sapient
mien
as
if
to
indicate
that
she
had
access
to
sources
of
wisdom
for
ever
closed
to
him
but
do
you
think
we
to
write
she
frowned
certainly
if
you
like
it
wo
do
any
good
you
do
suppose
her
aunt
will
come
down
here
do
you
and
even
if
she
did
there
it
is
and
there
you
are
just
let
me
wipe
my
shoulders
will
you
she
said
he
lifted
his
hands
obediently
and
as
they
were
damp
he
rubbed
them
on
the
loose
corner
of
the
towel
well
he
said
i
must
be
off
i
reckon
shall
you
see
mr
boutwood
i
might
i
know
where
to
catch
him
i
fancy
she
seemed
to
have
a
glimpse
of
her
husband
separate
life
in
the
town
masculine
haunts
and
habits
of
which
she
knew
nothing
and
would
always
know
nothing
and
the
large
existence
of
the
male
made
her
envious
going
to
see
him
now
well
yes
george
smiled
roguishly
what
shall
you
say
to
him
what
can
i
say
to
him
no
business
of
mine
you
know
except
that
lost
a
decent
servant
but
i
expect
that
sarah
fault
she
no
use
whatever
with
servants
now
sarah
is
shall
never
speak
to
boutwood
again
hilda
exclaimed
almost
passionately
oh
but
his
behaviour
is
simply
scandalous
it
really
wicked
a
man
like
him
george
put
his
lips
out
deprecatingly
you
may
depend
she
asked
for
it
he
said
what
she
asked
for
it
he
repeated
with
convinced
firmness
and
looked
at
her
steadily
a
flush
slowly
spread
over
her
face
and
neck
and
she
lowered
her
gaze
in
her
breast
pride
and
shame
were
again
mingled
you
keep
your
hair
on
said
george
soothingly
and
kissed
her
then
he
took
his
hat
and
stick
which
were
with
a
lot
of
other
things
on
the
broad
white
counterpane
and
went
off
stylishly
you
do
understand
she
threw
at
him
with
a
delicious
of
reproof
as
he
opened
the
door
she
reproached
herself
for
the
deceiving
coquetry
of
the
glance
do
i
he
returned
airily
he
was
quite
sure
that
nothing
escaped
his
intelligence
to
hilda
shocked
by
the
coarseness
and
the
obtuseness
which
evidently
characterized
his
attitude
now
as
on
other
occasions
this
was
desolating
it
was
ominously
sinister
iii
she
was
alone
with
her
image
in
the
mirror
and
the
image
was
precisely
the
same
that
she
had
always
seen
she
could
detect
no
change
in
it
whatever
she
liked
the
sensation
of
being
alone
and
at
home
in
this
room
which
before
she
had
only
entered
as
an
overseer
and
which
she
had
never
expected
to
occupy
she
savoured
the
intimacy
of
the
room
the
necessaries
on
the
washstand
the
superb
tortoiseshell
brushes
bought
by
george
in
dublin
on
the
the
open
trunks
clothes
on
a
chair
and
her
own
flimsy
trifles
on
the
bed
through
the
glass
she
saw
behind
her
image
the
image
of
the
closed
door
and
then
she
turned
round
to
look
at
the
real
door
and
to
assure
herself
that
it
was
closed
childish
and
yet
george
had
shut
the
door
she
remembered
the
noise
of
its
shutting
and
that
noise
in
her
memory
seemed
to
have
transformed
itself
into
the
sound
of
fate
deep
bell
she
could
hear
the
clang
sharp
definite
she
realized
suddenly
and
with
awe
that
her
destiny
was
fixed
hereafter
she
had
come
to
the
end
of
her
adventures
and
her
vague
dreams
for
she
had
always
dreamt
vaguely
of
an
enlarged
liberty
of
wide
interests
and
of
original
activities
such
as
no
woman
to
her
knowledge
had
ever
had
she
had
always
compared
the
life
of
men
with
the
life
of
women
and
admitted
and
resented
the
inferiority
of
the
latter
she
had
had
glimpses
once
of
the
male
world
she
had
made
herself
the
only
woman
in
the
five
towns
and
one
of
the
earliest
in
england
dizzy
thought
but
the
glimpses
had
been
vain
and
tantalizing
she
had
been
in
the
male
world
but
not
of
it
as
though
encircled
in
a
glass
ball
which
neither
she
nor
the
males
could
shatter
she
had
had
money
freedom
and
ambition
and
somehow
through
ignorance
or
through
lack
of
imagination
or
opportunity
had
been
unable
to
employ
them
she
had
never
known
what
she
wanted
the
vision
had
never
been
clear
and
she
reflected
i
wonder
if
my
daughter
supposing
i
had
one
would
be
as
different
from
me
as
i
am
from
my
mother
she
could
recall
with
intense
vividness
the
moment
when
she
had
first
really
contemplated
marriage
it
was
in
the
after
having
seen
edwin
clayhanger
at
the
door
of
clayhanger
shop
and
she
could
recall
the
sense
of
relief
with
which
she
had
envisaged
a
union
with
some
man
stronger
and
more
experienced
than
herself
in
the
relief
was
a
certain
secret
shame
as
though
it
implied
cowardice
a
shrinking
away
from
the
challenge
of
life
and
from
the
call
of
a
proud
instinct
in
the
she
had
foreseen
the
time
when
she
would
belong
utterly
to
some
man
surrendering
to
him
without
reserve
the
time
when
she
would
be
a
woman
and
the
thing
had
come
about
only
yesterday
she
had
been
a
little
girl
entering
george
cannon
office
with
timid
audacity
to
consult
him
only
yesterday
george
cannon
had
been
a
strange
formidable
man
indefinitely
older
and
infinitely
cleverer
than
she
and
now
they
were
man
and
wife
now
she
was
his
now
she
profoundly
knew
him
and
he
was
no
longer
formidable
in
spite
of
his
force
she
had
a
recondite
dominion
over
him
she
guessed
herself
to
be
his
superior
in
certain
qualities
he
was
revealed
to
her
she
felt
that
she
was
not
revealed
to
him
and
that
in
spite
of
her
wholehearted
surrender
she
had
not
given
all
because
of
his
blindness
to
what
she
offered
she
could
not
completely
respect
him
but
she
was
his
she
was
naught
apart
from
him
she
was
the
wife
his
existence
went
on
mainly
as
before
hers
was
diverted
narrowed
fundamentally
altered
never
now
could
she
be
enfranchised
into
the
male
world
iv
she
slipped
her
arms
into
a
new
bodice
purchased
in
london
on
the
second
day
of
the
marriage
blushing
she
had
tried
on
that
bodice
in
a
great
shop
in
oxford
street
then
it
was
that
she
had
first
said
in
public
all
that
day
she
had
felt
so
weak
and
shy
and
light
and
helpless
and
guilty
that
she
had
positively
not
known
what
she
was
doing
she
had
moved
in
a
phantom
world
only
she
had
perceived
quite
steadily
and
practically
that
she
must
give
more
attention
to
her
clothes
her
old
contempt
for
finery
expired
in
the
glory
of
her
new
condition
and
now
as
she
settled
the
elegant
bodice
on
her
shoulders
and
fastened
it
and
patted
her
hair
and
picked
up
the
skirt
and
poised
it
over
her
head
she
had
a
stern
preoccupied
look
as
of
one
who
said
this
that
i
am
doing
is
important
i
must
not
be
hurried
in
doing
it
it
is
vital
that
i
should
look
well
and
that
no
detail
of
my
appearance
should
jar
already
she
could
see
herself
standing
before
george
when
he
returned
for
the
meal
the
first
meal
which
they
would
take
together
in
the
home
she
could
feel
his
eyes
on
her
she
could
anticipate
her
own
mood
in
which
would
be
mingled
pride
misgiving
pleasure
helplessness
abandonment
and
the
secret
condescension
towards
him
of
her
inmost
soul
all
alone
in
the
room
she
could
feel
his
hands
again
on
her
shoulders
a
mysterious
excitation
she
was
a
married
woman
she
had
the
right
to
discuss
florrie
case
with
aloof
disdain
if
she
chose
her
respectability
was
unassailable
none
might
penetrate
beyond
the
fact
of
her
marriage
and
yet
far
within
her
she
was
ashamed
she
dimly
admitted
once
more
as
on
several
occasions
previous
to
her
marriage
that
she
had
dishonoured
an
ideal
her
conscience
would
not
chime
with
the
conscience
of
society
she
thought
as
she
prepared
with
pleasurable
expectancy
for
her
husband
this
is
not
right
this
can
not
lead
to
good
it
must
lead
to
evil
i
am
bound
to
suffer
for
it
the
whole
thing
is
wrong
i
know
it
and
i
have
always
known
it
already
she
was
disappointed
with
her
marriage
amid
the
fevers
of
bodily
appetite
she
could
clearly
distinguish
the
beginning
of
lassitude
she
no
longer
saw
her
husband
as
a
romantic
and
baffling
figure
she
had
explored
and
chartered
his
soul
and
not
all
his
excellences
could
atone
for
his
earthliness
she
wondered
grimly
where
and
under
what
circumstances
he
had
acquired
the
adroitness
which
had
charmed
and
still
did
charm
her
she
saw
in
front
of
her
a
vista
of
days
and
years
in
which
ennui
would
probably
increase
and
joy
diminish
and
she
put
her
shoulders
back
defiantly
and
thought
well
here
i
am
anyhow
i
wanted
him
and
i
got
him
what
i
have
to
go
through
i
shall
go
through
and
all
the
time
floating
like
vapour
over
these
depths
was
a
sheeny
mood
of
bright
expectation
and
immediate
naïve
content
and
she
said
gaily
that
she
must
write
at
once
to
janet
orgreave
to
announce
the
marriage
and
that
her
mother
uncle
up
in
the
north
must
also
be
informed
v
unusual
phenomena
made
themselves
apparent
on
the
top
staircase
raised
voices
which
hilda
could
hear
more
and
more
plainly
even
through
the
shut
door
at
no
in
the
nobody
ever
spoke
in
a
loud
tone
particularly
on
the
staircase
except
perhaps
florrie
when
in
conversation
with
louisa
she
thought
she
was
out
of
all
other
hearing
hilda
voice
was
very
clear
and
penetrating
but
not
loud
george
cannon
voice
in
public
places
such
as
the
staircase
had
an
almost
caressing
softness
the
watchetts
cooed
like
faint
doves
thereby
expressing
the
delicate
refinement
of
their
virginal
natures
the
voice
was
unknown
beyond
the
kitchen
and
nobody
was
more
grimly
in
speech
than
sarah
gailey
and
louisa
these
two
and
especially
louisa
seemed
generally
to
be
restraining
with
ease
tremendous
secret
forces
of
bitterness
and
contempt
and
now
it
was
just
these
two
who
were
noisy
and
becoming
noisier
to
the
dismay
of
a
scandalized
house
owing
to
some
accident
or
negligence
the
secret
forces
had
got
loose
hilda
shook
her
head
it
was
clear
that
the
problem
of
sarah
gailey
would
have
to
be
tackled
and
settled
very
soon
the
poor
physical
sufferings
had
without
doubt
reacted
detrimentally
on
her
temperament
and
temper
she
used
to
be
quite
extraordinarily
adroit
in
the
directing
of
servants
though
her
manner
to
them
never
approached
geniality
but
she
had
quarrelled
with
florrie
and
now
she
was
breaking
the
peace
with
louisa
it
was
preposterous
and
annoying
and
it
could
not
be
allowed
to
continue
hilda
was
not
seriously
alarmed
because
she
had
the
most
perfect
confidence
in
george
skill
to
restore
order
and
calm
and
to
conquer
every
difficulty
of
management
and
she
also
put
a
certain
trust
in
herself
but
the
menacing
and
vicious
accents
of
louisa
startled
her
and
she
sympathized
with
sarah
gailey
for
whom
humiliation
was
assuredly
in
store
if
not
immediately
at
the
tongue
of
louisa
then
later
when
george
would
have
to
hint
the
truth
to
her
about
her
decadence
the
dispute
on
the
attic
landing
appeared
to
be
concerning
linen
which
louisa
had
omitted
to
remove
from
florrie
abandoned
couch
in
her
kennel
i
ai
going
to
touch
her
sheets
not
for
nobody
louisa
proclaimed
savagely
and
by
that
single
phrase
with
its
implications
she
laid
unconsciously
bare
the
sordid
baseness
of
her
ageing
heart
she
exposed
by
her
mere
intonation
of
the
word
all
the
foulness
of
jealousy
and
thwarted
salacity
that
was
usually
concealed
beneath
her
tight
dress
and
neat
apron
and
beneath
her
prim
gestures
and
deferential
tones
her
undisciplined
voice
rang
spinsterishly
down
the
staircase
outraging
it
defiling
the
whole
interior
hilda
as
silently
as
possible
unlatched
the
door
of
the
bedroom
and
stood
with
ear
cocked
should
she
issue
forth
and
interfere
or
should
she
remain
discreetly
where
she
was
almost
in
the
same
instant
she
heard
the
cautious
unlatching
of
the
door
two
of
the
watchetts
were
there
listening
also
and
there
came
up
from
the
ground
floor
a
faint
giggle
the
cook
at
the
kitchen
door
was
enjoying
herself
and
giggling
moral
support
to
her
colleague
the
giggle
proved
that
the
master
was
out
that
the
young
mistress
had
not
yet
established
a
definite
position
and
that
during
recent
weeks
the
old
mistress
must
have
been
steadily
dissipating
her
own
authority
hilda
peered
along
the
landing
from
her
lair
and
upstairs
and
downstairs
she
could
see
nothing
but
senseless
carpets
and
brass
rods
and
steps
and
banisters
but
she
knew
that
the
entire
household
she
had
the
sensation
that
the
very
house
itself
was
alert
and
eavesdropping
there
was
a
hesitating
movement
on
the
unseen
stairs
above
and
then
hilda
could
see
sarah
gailey
felt
slippers
and
the
valance
of
her
skirt
and
she
could
hear
sarah
emotional
breathing
very
well
louisa
i
done
sarah
voice
was
quieter
now
she
was
trying
to
control
it
and
to
a
limited
extent
was
controlling
its
volume
it
shook
in
spite
of
her
she
spoke
true
she
had
indeed
done
she
was
at
the
end
of
her
resources
i
been
in
houses
louisa
conqueringly
sneered
that
i
have
but
i
never
been
in
a
house
afore
where
one
as
ought
to
have
been
girl
went
off
with
a
boarder
and
nothing
said
and
him
the
friend
of
the
master
and
it
is
as
if
that
was
all
sheets
indeed
i
nothing
further
to
say
sarah
returned
unnecessarily
and
descended
the
stair
i
shall
simply
report
to
cannon
we
shall
see
and
what
this
about
cannon
louisa
shouted
beside
herself
the
peculiarity
of
her
tone
arrested
sarah
gailey
hilda
flushed
the
watchetts
were
listening
the
watchetts
had
not
yet
been
told
of
the
marriage
the
announcement
was
to
be
made
to
them
formally
a
little
later
and
now
it
was
louisa
who
was
making
the
announcement
brutally
coarsely
the
outrage
of
the
episode
was
a
hundredfold
intensified
it
grew
into
an
inconceivable
ghastly
horror
hilda
seemed
to
have
a
physical
body
and
louisa
to
be
hacking
at
it
with
a
jagged
knife
cannon
has
brought
his
wife
home
said
sarah
gailey
shortly
with
a
dignity
and
courage
that
increased
as
her
distance
from
the
appalling
the
incredible
louisa
hilda
could
see
her
pale
face
now
the
eyebrows
and
chin
were
lifted
in
scorn
of
the
vile
menial
but
the
poor
head
was
trembling
and
what
about
his
other
wife
louisa
sarah
gailey
looked
again
up
the
stairs
i
know
you
in
a
temper
and
not
responsible
for
what
you
say
but
you
better
be
careful
she
spoke
with
elaborate
haughty
negligence
had
i
louisa
shrilled
what
i
say
is
what
about
his
other
wife
what
about
the
old
woman
he
married
in
devonshire
why
god
bless
me
florrie
was
full
of
it
could
talk
about
anything
else
in
bed
of
a
night
did
you
know
the
old
woman
been
inquiring
for
her
beautiful
down
your
way
she
laughed
loudly
turnhill
and
all
of
you
lying
low
and
then
making
out
all
of
a
sudden
as
brought
his
wife
home
a
nice
house
and
i
been
in
a
few
too
hilda
could
feel
her
heart
beating
with
terrific
force
against
her
bodice
but
she
was
conscious
of
no
other
sensation
she
heard
a
loud
snort
of
shattering
contempt
from
louisa
and
then
a
strange
and
terrific
silence
fell
on
the
stairs
there
was
no
sound
even
of
a
movement
the
watchetts
did
not
stir
the
cook
did
not
stir
sarah
gailey
did
not
stir
louisa
fury
was
sated
the
empty
landing
lay
as
it
were
expectant
at
hilda
door
then
sarah
gailey
perceived
hilda
half
hidden
in
the
doorway
and
staggeringly
rushed
towards
her
in
an
instant
they
were
both
in
the
bedroom
and
the
door
shut
when
will
george
be
back
so
that
he
can
put
her
out
of
the
house
sarah
whispered
frantically
soon
i
expect
said
hilda
and
felt
intensely
they
said
no
more
and
it
was
as
though
the
house
were
besieged
and
invested
and
only
in
that
room
were
they
safe
and
even
in
that
room
only
for
a
few
moments
chapter
ii
some
secret
history
i
without
a
word
sarah
had
left
the
bedroom
hilda
waited
sitting
on
the
bed
for
george
to
come
back
from
his
haunts
in
the
town
she
both
intensely
desired
and
intensely
feared
his
return
a
phrase
or
two
of
an
angry
and
vicious
servant
had
almost
destroyed
her
faith
in
her
husband
it
seemed
very
strange
even
to
her
that
this
should
be
so
and
she
wondered
whether
she
had
ever
had
a
real
faith
in
him
whether
passion
apart
her
feeling
for
him
had
ever
been
aught
but
admiration
of
his
impressive
adroitness
was
it
possible
that
he
had
another
wife
alive
no
it
was
not
possible
that
is
to
say
it
was
not
possible
that
such
a
catastrophe
should
have
happened
to
just
her
to
hilda
lessways
sitting
there
on
the
bed
with
her
hands
pressing
on
the
rough
surface
of
the
damask
counterpane
and
yet
how
could
louisa
or
florrie
have
invented
the
story
wicked
shocking
incredible
that
florrie
with
her
soft
voice
and
timid
affectionate
manner
should
have
been
chattering
in
secret
so
scandalously
during
all
these
weeks
she
remembered
the
look
on
florrie
blushing
face
when
the
child
had
received
the
letter
on
the
morning
of
their
departure
from
the
house
in
lessways
street
even
then
the
attractively
innocent
and
capable
florrie
must
have
had
her
naughty
secrets
an
odious
world
and
hilda
married
had
seriously
thought
that
she
knew
all
about
the
world
she
had
to
admit
bewildered
only
a
girl
after
all
and
a
very
simple
one
she
compared
her
own
heart
in
its
simplicity
with
that
of
louisa
louisa
horrified
and
frightened
her
louisa
and
florrie
were
mischievous
liars
florrie
had
seized
some
fragment
of
silly
gossip
turnhill
was
notorious
for
its
silly
gossip
and
the
two
of
them
had
embroidered
it
in
the
nastiness
of
their
souls
she
laughed
shortly
disdainfully
to
wither
up
silly
gossip
preposterous
and
yet
when
george
had
shown
her
the
licence
in
the
name
of
cannon
and
she
had
ventured
to
say
apologetically
and
caressingly
i
always
understood
your
real
name
was
canonges
how
queerly
he
had
looked
as
he
answered
i
changed
it
long
ago
legally
yes
and
she
had
persuaded
herself
that
the
queerness
of
his
look
was
only
in
her
fancy
but
it
was
not
only
in
her
fancy
suspicions
sinister
trifling
souvenirs
crowded
into
her
mind
had
she
not
always
doubted
him
had
she
not
always
said
to
herself
that
she
was
doing
wrong
in
her
marriage
and
that
she
would
thereby
suffer
had
she
not
abandoned
the
pursuit
of
religious
truth
in
favour
of
light
enjoyments
foolish
of
course
of
course
to
put
two
and
two
together
in
this
way
but
she
could
not
refrain
i
am
ruined
she
decided
in
awe
and
the
next
instant
she
was
saying
how
absurd
of
me
to
be
like
this
merely
because
louisa
she
thought
she
heard
a
noise
below
her
heart
leapt
again
into
violent
activity
trembling
she
crept
to
the
door
and
gently
unlatched
it
no
slightest
sound
in
the
whole
house
dusk
was
coming
on
swiftly
then
she
could
hear
all
the
noises
accentuated
beyond
custom
of
louisa
setting
tea
in
the
for
the
watchetts
and
then
the
rang
despite
her
fury
apparent
in
the
noises
louisa
had
not
found
courage
to
neglect
the
sacred
boarders
she
made
a
defiant
fuss
but
she
had
to
yield
intimidated
to
the
force
of
habit
and
tradition
the
watchetts
descended
the
staircase
from
the
practising
as
usual
elaborate
among
themselves
they
had
heard
every
infamous
word
of
louisa
tirade
which
had
engendered
in
them
a
truly
dreadful
and
still
delicious
emotion
but
they
descended
the
staircase
in
good
order
discussing
the
project
for
a
new
pier
they
reached
the
and
shut
the
door
on
themselves
silence
again
louisa
ought
now
to
have
set
the
tea
in
the
basement
parlour
but
louisa
did
not
louisa
was
hidden
in
the
kitchen
doubtless
talking
fourteen
to
the
dozen
with
the
cook
she
had
done
all
she
meant
to
do
she
knew
that
she
would
be
compelled
to
leave
at
once
and
not
another
stroke
would
she
do
of
any
kind
the
master
and
the
mistresses
must
manage
as
best
they
could
louisa
was
already
wondering
where
she
would
sleep
that
night
for
she
was
alone
on
earth
and
owned
one
small
trunk
and
a
post
office
savings
bank
book
all
this
trouble
on
account
of
florrie
sheets
sarah
gailey
was
in
her
bedroom
and
did
not
dare
to
came
out
of
it
even
to
accuse
louisa
of
neglecting
the
basement
tea
and
hilda
continued
to
stand
for
ages
at
the
bedroom
door
while
the
dusk
grew
deeper
and
deeper
at
last
the
front
door
opened
and
george
step
was
in
the
hall
hilda
recognized
it
with
a
thrill
of
terror
turning
pale
george
ran
down
into
the
basement
and
stumbled
hello
she
heard
him
call
out
what
about
tea
where
are
you
all
sarah
no
answer
no
sound
in
response
he
ran
up
the
basement
steps
would
he
call
in
at
the
or
would
he
come
to
the
bedroom
in
search
of
her
he
did
not
stop
at
the
hilda
wanted
to
shut
the
bedroom
door
but
dared
not
because
she
could
not
do
it
noiselessly
now
he
was
on
the
first
floor
she
rushed
to
the
bed
and
sat
on
it
as
she
had
been
sitting
previously
and
waited
in
the
most
painful
and
irrational
agony
she
was
astonished
at
the
darkness
of
the
room
turning
her
head
she
saw
only
a
whitish
blur
instead
of
a
face
in
the
mirror
ii
what
up
he
demanded
bursting
somewhat
urgently
into
the
bedroom
with
his
hat
on
what
price
the
husband
coming
home
to
his
tea
no
tea
no
light
i
nearly
broke
my
neck
down
the
basement
stairs
he
put
his
hands
against
her
elbows
and
kissed
her
rather
clumsily
owing
to
the
gloom
between
her
nose
and
her
mouth
she
did
not
shrink
back
but
accepted
the
embrace
quite
insensibly
the
contact
of
his
moustache
and
of
his
lips
and
his
slight
pleasant
masculine
odour
produced
no
effect
on
her
whatever
why
are
you
sitting
here
look
here
i
signed
the
transfer
of
those
continental
shares
and
paid
the
cheque
so
it
domino
now
between
the
engagement
and
the
marriage
there
had
been
an
opportunity
of
purchasing
three
thousand
pounds
worth
of
preference
shares
in
the
brighton
hotel
continental
limited
which
hotel
was
the
latest
and
largest
in
the
king
road
a
vast
affair
of
eight
storeys
and
bathrooms
on
every
floor
the
chance
of
such
an
investment
had
fascinated
george
it
helped
his
dreams
and
pointed
to
the
time
when
he
would
be
manager
and
part
proprietor
of
a
palace
like
the
continental
hilda
being
very
willing
he
had
sold
her
railways
shares
and
purchased
the
hotel
shares
and
he
knew
that
he
had
done
a
good
thing
now
he
possessed
an
interest
in
three
different
establishments
he
who
had
scarcely
been
in
brighton
a
year
the
rapid
progress
he
felt
was
characteristic
of
him
hilda
kept
silence
for
the
sole
reason
that
she
could
think
of
no
words
to
say
as
for
the
matter
of
the
investment
it
appeared
to
her
to
be
inexpressibly
uninteresting
from
under
the
lashes
of
lowered
eyes
she
saw
his
form
shadowily
in
front
of
her
you
do
mean
to
say
sarah
been
making
herself
disagreeable
already
he
said
and
his
tone
was
affectionate
and
diplomatic
yet
faintly
ironical
he
had
perceived
that
something
unusual
had
occurred
perhaps
something
serious
and
he
was
anxious
to
soothe
and
to
justify
his
wife
hilda
perfectly
understood
his
mood
and
intention
and
she
was
reassured
has
sarah
told
you
she
asked
in
a
harsh
uncontrolled
voice
though
she
knew
that
he
had
not
seen
sarah
no
where
is
she
he
inquired
patiently
it
louisa
hilda
went
on
with
the
sick
fright
of
a
child
compelled
by
intimidation
to
affront
a
danger
her
mouth
was
very
dry
oh
she
lost
her
temper
and
made
a
fearful
scene
with
sarah
on
the
stairs
she
said
the
most
awful
things
george
laughed
low
and
lightly
he
guessed
louisa
gift
for
foul
insolence
and
invective
for
instance
george
encouraged
he
was
divining
from
hilda
singular
tone
that
tact
would
be
needed
well
she
said
you
got
a
wife
living
in
devonshire
there
was
a
pause
and
who
told
her
that
florrie
muttered
george
hilda
could
not
decide
whether
his
voice
was
natural
or
forced
then
he
stepped
across
to
the
door
and
opened
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
her
hilda
questioned
as
it
were
despairingly
he
left
the
room
and
banged
the
door
it
not
true
hilda
was
beginning
to
say
to
herself
but
she
seemed
to
derive
no
pleasure
from
the
dawning
hope
of
george
innocence
then
george
came
into
the
room
again
hesitated
and
shut
the
door
carefully
i
suppose
it
no
good
about
he
said
in
such
a
tone
as
he
might
have
used
had
he
been
vexed
and
disgusted
with
hilda
i
have
got
a
wife
living
and
she
in
devonshire
i
expect
she
been
inquiring
in
turnhill
if
i
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
probably
wants
to
get
married
again
herself
hilda
glanced
at
his
form
and
suddenly
it
was
the
form
of
a
stranger
but
a
stranger
who
had
loved
her
and
she
thought
why
did
i
let
this
stranger
love
me
it
was
scarce
believable
that
she
had
ever
seriously
regarded
him
as
a
husband
and
she
found
that
tears
were
running
down
her
cheeks
and
she
felt
all
her
girlishness
and
fragility
did
i
always
know
she
asked
herself
with
weak
resignation
that
it
was
unreal
what
am
i
to
do
now
the
catastrophe
had
indeed
happened
to
her
and
she
could
not
deal
with
it
she
did
not
even
feel
tragic
she
did
not
feel
particularly
resentful
against
george
she
had
read
of
such
catastrophes
in
the
newspapers
but
the
reality
of
experience
nonplussed
her
i
ought
to
do
something
she
reflected
but
what
what
the
use
of
me
saying
i
sorry
he
asked
savagely
i
acted
for
the
best
the
chances
were
ten
thousand
to
one
against
me
being
spotted
but
there
you
are
you
never
know
your
luck
he
spoke
meditatively
in
a
rather
hoarse
indistinct
voice
all
owing
to
florrie
of
course
when
it
was
suggested
we
should
have
that
girl
i
knew
there
was
a
danger
but
i
it
i
said
nothing
could
possibly
happen
and
just
look
at
it
now
i
wanted
to
cut
myself
clear
of
the
five
towns
absolutely
absolutely
and
then
like
a
damnation
fool
i
let
florrie
come
here
if
she
had
come
that
woman
might
have
inquired
about
me
in
turnhill
till
all
was
blue
without
you
hearing
about
her
but
there
it
is
he
snapped
his
fingers
it
my
fault
for
being
found
out
that
the
only
thing
i
guilty
of
and
look
at
it
look
at
it
hilda
could
tell
from
the
movements
of
the
vague
form
in
the
corner
by
the
door
and
by
the
quality
of
his
voice
that
george
cannon
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
emotion
she
had
never
known
him
half
so
moved
his
emotion
excited
her
and
flattered
her
she
thought
how
wonderful
it
was
that
she
the
shaking
little
girl
who
yesterday
had
run
off
with
fourpence
to
buy
a
meal
at
a
should
be
the
cause
of
this
emotion
in
such
a
man
she
thought
my
life
is
marvellous
she
was
dizzied
by
the
conception
of
the
capacity
of
her
own
body
and
soul
for
experience
no
factors
save
her
own
body
and
soul
and
his
had
been
necessary
to
the
bringing
about
of
the
situation
it
was
essential
only
that
the
man
and
the
woman
should
be
together
and
their
companionship
would
produce
miracles
of
experience
she
ceased
crying
astounding
that
she
had
never
in
george
eyes
suspected
his
past
it
was
as
if
he
had
swiftly
opened
a
concealed
door
in
the
house
of
their
passion
and
disclosed
a
vista
of
which
she
had
not
dreamed
but
surely
that
must
have
been
a
long
time
ago
she
said
in
an
ordinary
tone
considering
that
i
was
yes
why
did
you
leave
her
why
did
i
leave
her
because
i
had
to
i
gone
as
a
clerk
in
a
solicitor
office
in
torquay
and
she
was
a
client
she
went
mad
about
me
i
only
telling
you
she
was
a
spinster
had
one
of
those
big
houses
high
up
on
the
hill
behind
the
town
he
stopped
and
then
his
voice
began
to
come
again
out
of
the
deep
shadow
in
the
corner
she
wanted
me
and
she
got
me
and
she
did
care
who
knew
the
wedding
was
in
the
i
told
her
i
got
no
relations
and
she
was
jolly
glad
but
how
old
was
she
young
george
sneered
she
never
see
again
the
day
she
was
married
very
stylish
and
all
that
carried
me
off
my
feet
of
course
there
was
the
money
i
may
as
well
out
with
it
all
while
i
about
it
she
made
me
an
absolute
present
of
four
thousand
pounds
insisted
on
doing
it
i
never
asked
of
course
i
know
i
married
for
money
it
happens
to
youths
sometimes
just
as
it
does
to
girls
it
may
be
disgusting
but
not
more
disgusting
for
one
than
for
the
other
besides
i
did
realize
it
was
a
sale
and
purchase
at
the
time
oh
and
it
lasted
about
ten
days
i
could
stand
it
so
i
told
her
so
and
chucked
it
she
began
an
action
for
restitution
of
conjugal
rights
but
she
soon
tired
of
that
she
would
have
her
four
thousand
back
simply
would
she
was
a
terror
but
i
say
that
for
her
well
i
kept
it
four
thousand
pounds
is
a
lot
of
brass
that
how
i
started
business
in
turnhill
if
you
want
to
know
he
spoke
defiantly
you
may
depend
i
never
let
on
in
the
five
towns
about
my
beautiful
marriage
that
the
tale
you
got
to
remember
i
was
she
thought
of
edwin
clayhanger
and
charlie
orgreave
as
being
about
and
tried
in
her
imagination
to
endow
the
mature
george
cannon
with
their
youth
and
their
simplicity
and
their
freshness
she
was
saddened
and
overawed
not
wrathful
not
obsessed
by
a
sense
of
injury
then
she
heard
a
sob
in
the
corner
and
then
another
the
moment
was
terrible
for
her
she
could
only
distinguish
in
the
room
the
blur
of
a
man
shape
against
the
and
the
whiteness
of
the
counterpane
and
the
dark
square
of
the
window
broken
by
the
black
silhouette
of
the
mirror
she
slipped
off
the
bed
and
going
in
the
direction
of
the
groped
for
a
and
lit
the
gas
dazzled
by
the
glare
of
the
gas
she
turned
to
look
at
the
corner
where
stood
george
cannon
iii
the
whole
aspect
of
the
room
was
now
altered
the
window
was
blacker
than
anything
else
light
shone
on
the
carved
frame
of
the
mirror
and
on
the
vessels
of
the
washstand
the
trunks
each
threw
a
sharply
defined
shadow
the
bed
was
half
in
the
shadow
of
its
mahogany
foot
and
half
a
glittering
white
all
the
array
of
requisites
on
the
lay
stark
under
the
close
scrutiny
of
the
gas
and
high
above
the
bed
partly
on
the
wall
and
partly
on
the
ceiling
was
a
bright
oblong
reflection
from
the
upturned
mirror
hilda
turned
to
george
with
a
straightening
of
the
shoulders
as
if
to
say
it
is
i
who
have
the
courage
to
light
the
gas
and
face
the
situation
but
when
she
saw
him
her
challenging
pride
seemed
to
die
slowly
away
though
there
was
no
sign
of
a
tear
on
his
features
and
though
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
it
was
he
who
had
just
sobbed
nevertheless
his
figure
was
dismayingly
tragic
every
feature
was
distorted
by
agitation
he
was
absorbed
in
himself
shameless
and
careless
of
appearances
he
was
no
more
concerned
about
appearances
and
manly
shame
than
a
sufferer
dying
in
torment
he
was
beyond
all
that
in
truth
a
new
george
cannon
he
left
the
corner
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
in
the
hollow
made
by
hilda
and
stared
at
the
wall
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
gay
suit
his
gestures
as
he
moved
and
his
posture
as
he
sat
made
their
unconscious
appeal
to
her
in
their
abandonment
he
was
caught
he
was
vanquished
he
was
despairing
but
he
instinctively
and
without
any
wish
to
do
so
kept
his
dignity
he
was
still
in
his
complete
overthrow
the
mature
man
of
the
world
the
man
to
whom
it
was
impossible
to
be
ridiculous
hilda
in
a
curious
way
grew
proud
of
him
with
an
extraordinary
inconsequence
she
dwelt
upon
the
fact
that
always
grand
even
as
a
caterer
he
had
caused
to
be
printed
at
the
foot
of
the
menu
forms
which
he
had
instituted
the
words
a
second
helping
of
all
or
any
of
the
above
dishes
will
willingly
be
served
if
so
desired
and
in
the
general
havoc
of
the
shock
she
began
to
be
proud
also
of
herself
because
it
was
the
mysterious
power
of
her
individuality
that
had
originated
the
disaster
the
sense
of
their
intimate
withdrawn
seclusion
in
the
room
disordered
and
littered
by
arrival
utterly
alone
save
for
the
living
flame
of
the
gas
the
sense
of
the
tragedy
and
of
the
responsibility
for
it
and
especially
her
responsibility
the
sense
of
an
imposed
burden
to
be
grimly
borne
and
of
an
unknown
destiny
to
be
worked
out
the
sense
of
pity
the
sense
of
youth
and
force
these
things
gradually
exalted
her
and
ennobled
her
desolation
why
did
you
keep
it
from
me
she
asked
in
a
very
clear
and
precise
tone
not
aggrieved
but
fatalistic
and
melancholy
keep
what
from
you
at
length
he
met
her
eyes
darkly
all
this
about
your
being
married
why
did
i
keep
it
from
you
he
repeated
harshly
and
then
his
tone
changed
from
defiance
to
a
softened
regret
i
tell
you
why
i
kept
it
from
you
because
i
knew
if
i
told
you
i
should
have
no
chance
with
a
girl
like
you
i
knew
it
be
all
up
if
i
so
much
as
breathed
a
hint
of
it
i
do
suppose
you
the
slightest
idea
how
you
are
me
she
protested
look
here
he
said
persuasively
supposing
i
told
you
i
wanted
you
and
then
that
i
got
a
wife
living
what
would
you
have
said
i
do
know
no
but
know
and
suppose
i
told
you
i
got
a
wife
living
and
then
told
you
i
wanted
you
what
then
no
hilda
nobody
could
fool
about
with
you
she
was
flattered
but
she
thought
secretly
he
could
have
won
me
on
any
terms
he
liked
i
wonder
whether
he
have
won
me
on
any
terms
that
first
night
in
this
house
when
we
were
in
the
front
attic
suppose
he
told
me
then
i
wonder
what
should
i
have
said
but
the
severity
of
her
countenance
was
a
perfect
mask
for
such
weak
and
uncertain
ideas
and
confirmed
him
deeply
in
his
estimate
of
her
he
continued
now
that
first
night
in
this
house
upstairs
he
jerked
his
head
towards
the
ceiling
she
blushed
not
from
any
shame
but
because
his
thought
had
surprised
hers
i
was
as
near
as
dammit
to
letting
out
the
whole
thing
and
chancing
it
with
you
but
i
did
i
saw
it
be
no
use
and
that
not
the
only
time
either
she
stood
silent
by
the
calmly
looking
at
him
and
she
asked
herself
eagerly
curious
when
were
the
other
times
of
course
it
all
my
fault
he
said
what
is
this
all
my
fault
i
do
want
to
excuse
myself
i
nothing
to
say
for
myself
in
her
mind
she
secretly
interrupted
him
yes
you
have
you
do
without
me
is
that
enough
i
ashamed
he
said
without
reserve
abasing
himself
i
utterly
ashamed
i
give
anything
to
be
able
to
undo
it
she
was
startled
and
offended
she
had
not
expected
that
he
would
kiss
the
dust
she
hated
to
see
him
thus
she
thought
it
is
all
your
fault
it
just
as
much
mine
as
yours
but
even
if
i
was
ashamed
never
confess
it
never
would
i
grovel
and
never
would
i
want
to
undo
anything
after
all
you
took
the
chances
you
did
what
you
thought
best
why
be
ashamed
when
things
go
wrong
you
would
have
been
ashamed
if
things
had
gone
right
of
course
he
said
after
a
pause
i
completely
done
for
he
spoke
so
solemnly
and
with
such
intense
conviction
that
she
was
awed
and
appalled
she
felt
as
one
who
having
alone
escaped
destruction
in
an
earthquake
stands
afar
off
and
contemplates
the
silent
strewn
ruin
of
a
vast
city
and
the
thought
ran
through
her
mind
like
a
squirrel
through
a
tree
how
he
refuse
her
four
thousand
pounds
and
if
she
have
it
back
well
what
was
he
to
do
she
must
be
a
horrible
woman
iv
both
of
them
heard
a
heavy
step
pass
up
the
staircase
it
was
louisa
she
paused
to
strike
a
match
and
light
the
gas
on
the
landing
and
went
on
but
sarah
gailey
had
given
no
sign
and
the
watchetts
were
still
shut
in
the
all
these
women
were
preoccupied
by
the
affair
of
george
cannon
all
of
them
guessed
now
that
charge
was
not
unfounded
otherwise
why
the
mysterious
and
interminable
interview
between
george
cannon
and
hilda
in
the
bedroom
hilda
pictured
them
all
and
she
thought
but
it
is
who
am
in
the
bedroom
with
him
it
is
i
who
am
living
through
it
and
facing
it
out
they
are
all
far
older
than
me
but
they
are
outsiders
they
do
know
what
life
is
george
rose
picked
up
a
portmanteau
and
threw
it
open
on
the
bed
and
what
is
to
be
done
hilda
asked
trembling
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
i
suppose
i
must
stay
here
she
shook
her
head
with
lips
pressed
tight
his
voice
was
thick
and
obscure
when
he
asked
you
wo
come
with
me
she
shook
her
head
again
she
could
not
have
spoken
she
was
in
acute
torture
well
he
said
i
suppose
i
can
count
on
you
not
to
give
me
up
to
the
police
the
police
she
exclaimed
why
well
you
know
it
a
three
years
job
at
least
ever
heard
the
word
his
voice
was
slightly
ironical
oh
dear
she
breathed
already
disconcerted
it
had
positively
not
occurred
to
her
to
consider
the
legal
aspect
of
george
conduct
but
what
can
you
do
she
asked
with
the
innocent
ignorant
helplessness
of
a
girl
i
can
disappear
he
replied
that
all
i
can
do
i
do
see
myself
in
prison
i
went
over
stafford
prison
once
the
governor
showed
several
of
us
over
and
i
do
see
myself
in
prison
he
began
to
cast
things
into
the
portmanteau
and
as
he
did
so
he
proceeded
without
a
single
glance
at
hilda
you
be
all
right
for
money
and
so
on
but
i
should
advise
you
to
leave
here
and
not
to
come
back
any
sooner
than
you
can
help
that
the
best
thing
you
can
do
and
be
hilda
lessways
again
sarah
will
have
to
manage
this
place
as
best
she
can
fortunately
her
improved
she
can
make
it
pay
very
well
if
she
likes
it
a
handsome
living
for
her
my
deposit
on
the
chichester
and
so
on
will
have
to
be
forfeited
and
you
she
murmured
his
back
was
towards
her
he
turned
his
head
looked
at
her
enigmatically
for
an
instant
and
resumed
his
packing
she
desired
to
help
him
with
the
packing
she
desired
to
show
him
some
tenderness
her
heart
was
cleft
in
two
with
pity
but
she
could
not
move
some
harshness
of
pride
or
vanity
prevented
her
from
moving
when
he
had
carelessly
finished
the
portmanteau
he
strode
to
the
door
opened
it
wide
and
called
out
in
a
loud
firm
voice
louisa
a
reply
came
weakly
from
the
top
floor
yes
sir
i
want
you
he
had
a
short
way
with
louisa
after
a
brief
delay
she
came
to
the
bedroom
door
run
down
to
the
king
road
and
get
me
a
cab
he
said
to
her
at
the
door
as
it
were
confidentially
yes
sir
the
woman
was
like
a
christian
slave
here
take
the
portmanteau
down
with
you
to
the
front
door
he
gave
her
the
portmanteau
yes
sir
she
disappeared
and
then
there
was
the
noise
of
the
front
door
opening
george
picked
up
his
hat
and
abruptly
left
the
room
hilda
moved
to
and
fro
nervously
stiff
with
having
stood
still
so
long
she
wondered
how
he
and
how
she
would
comport
themselves
in
the
ordeal
of
adieu
in
a
few
moments
a
cab
drove
up
louisa
had
probably
encountered
it
on
the
way
hilda
waited
tense
then
she
heard
the
cab
driving
off
again
she
rushed
aghast
to
the
window
she
saw
the
roof
of
the
disappearing
cab
and
the
unwieldy
portmanteau
on
it
he
had
gone
he
had
gone
without
saying
that
was
his
device
for
simplifying
the
situation
it
was
drastic
but
it
was
magnificent
he
had
gone
out
of
the
house
and
out
of
her
life
as
she
gazed
at
the
dim
swaying
roof
of
the
cab
magically
the
roof
was
taken
off
and
she
could
see
the
ravaged
and
stricken
figure
within
sitting
grimly
in
the
dark
between
the
wheels
that
rolled
him
away
from
her
the
vision
was
intolerable
she
moved
aside
and
wept
passionately
how
could
he
help
doing
all
he
had
done
she
had
possessed
him
the
memories
of
his
embrace
told
her
how
utterly
all
that
he
had
said
was
true
and
this
being
so
who
could
blame
his
conduct
he
had
only
risked
and
lost
sarah
gailey
suddenly
appeared
in
the
room
and
shut
the
door
like
a
conspirator
then
she
began
and
hilda
nodded
ceasing
to
cry
oh
my
poor
dear
sarah
gailey
moaned
feebly
her
head
bobbing
with
its
unconscious
nervous
movements
the
sight
of
her
worn
saddened
features
sharpened
hilda
appreciation
of
her
own
girlishness
and
inexperience
but
despite
the
shock
despite
her
extreme
misery
despite
the
anguish
and
fear
in
her
heart
and
the
immense
difficulty
of
the
new
situation
into
which
she
was
thus
violently
thrust
hilda
was
not
without
consolation
she
felt
none
of
the
shame
conventionally
proper
to
a
girl
deceived
on
the
contrary
deep
within
herself
she
knew
that
the
catastrophe
was
a
deliverance
she
knew
that
fate
had
favoured
her
by
absolving
her
from
the
consequences
of
a
tragic
weakness
and
error
these
thoughts
inflamed
and
rendered
more
beautiful
the
apprehensive
pity
for
the
real
victim
now
affronted
by
a
new
danger
the
menace
of
the
law
book
vi
her
punishment
chapter
i
evening
at
bleakridge
i
when
hilda
cab
turned
perilously
swaying
through
the
gate
into
the
dark
garden
of
the
orgreaves
hilda
saw
another
cab
already
at
the
open
house
door
and
in
the
lighted
porch
stood
figures
distinguishable
as
janet
and
alicia
all
enwrapped
for
a
journey
and
martha
holding
more
wraps
the
long
façade
of
the
house
was
black
save
for
one
window
on
the
first
floor
which
threw
a
faint
radiance
on
the
leafless
branches
of
elms
and
thus
intensified
the
upper
mysteries
of
the
nocturnal
garden
the
arrival
of
the
second
cab
caused
excitement
in
the
porch
and
hilda
leaning
out
of
the
window
into
the
november
mist
shook
with
apprehension
as
her
vehicle
came
to
a
halt
behind
the
other
one
she
was
now
to
meet
friends
for
the
first
time
after
her
secret
and
unhappy
adventure
she
feared
that
janet
by
some
magic
insight
of
affection
would
read
at
once
in
her
face
the
whole
history
of
the
past
year
janet
had
written
to
her
giving
and
asking
for
news
and
urging
a
visit
on
the
very
day
after
the
scene
in
which
george
cannon
admitted
his
turpitude
had
the
letter
been
sent
a
day
or
two
sooner
reaching
hilda
on
her
honeymoon
she
would
certainly
have
replied
to
it
with
the
tremendous
news
of
her
marriage
and
her
marriage
having
been
made
public
in
the
five
towns
her
shame
also
would
necessarily
be
public
but
chance
had
saved
her
from
this
humiliation
nobody
in
the
district
was
aware
of
the
marriage
by
a
characteristic
instinct
she
had
been
determined
not
to
announce
it
in
any
way
until
the
honeymoon
was
over
in
answer
to
janet
she
had
written
very
briefly
as
was
usual
with
her
and
said
that
she
would
come
to
lane
end
house
as
soon
as
she
could
shall
i
tell
her
or
sha
i
she
had
cogitated
and
the
decision
had
been
for
postponement
but
she
strongly
desired
nevertheless
to
pay
the
visit
she
had
had
more
than
enough
of
preston
street
and
of
brighton
and
longed
to
leave
at
any
price
and
at
length
one
dull
morning
after
george
cannon
had
sailed
for
america
and
all
affairs
were
somehow
arranged
or
had
arranged
themselves
and
sarah
gailey
was
better
and
the
autumn
season
smoothly
running
with
new
servants
she
had
suddenly
said
to
sarah
i
have
to
go
to
bursley
for
a
few
days
and
she
had
gone
upon
the
impulse
without
having
previously
warned
janet
changing
at
knype
she
had
got
into
the
wrong
train
and
had
found
herself
at
shawport
at
the
far
lower
end
of
bursley
instead
of
up
at
bleakridge
close
by
the
orgreaves
and
there
was
of
course
no
cab
for
her
but
a
cabman
who
had
brought
a
fare
to
the
station
and
was
driving
his
young
woman
back
had
offered
in
a
friendly
way
to
take
hilda
too
and
she
had
sat
in
the
cab
with
the
young
woman
who
was
a
paintress
at
peel
great
manufactory
at
shawport
and
suffered
from
a
weak
chest
and
they
had
talked
about
the
potters
strike
which
was
then
upheaving
the
district
and
the
cab
had
overtaken
a
procession
of
thinly
clad
potters
wending
in
the
bitter
mist
to
a
mass
meeting
at
hanbridge
and
hilda
had
been
thereby
much
impressed
and
angered
against
all
employers
and
the
young
woman
had
left
the
cab
up
trafalgar
road
with
a
delicious
smile
of
adieu
and
hilda
had
thought
how
different
all
this
was
from
brighton
and
how
much
better
and
more
homely
and
understandable
and
now
she
was
in
the
garden
of
the
orgreaves
martha
came
peeping
to
discover
the
explanation
of
this
singular
concourse
of
cabs
in
the
garden
and
she
cried
joyously
oh
miss
janet
it
miss
hilda
miss
lessways
i
mean
alicia
shrieked
the
first
cab
drew
forward
to
make
room
for
hilda
and
hilda
stepped
down
into
the
glare
of
the
porch
and
was
plainly
beheld
by
all
three
girls
will
they
notice
anything
she
asked
herself
almost
trembling
as
she
thought
of
the
terrific
changes
that
had
passed
in
her
since
her
previous
visit
but
nobody
noticed
anything
nobody
observed
that
this
was
not
the
same
hilda
even
in
the
intimacy
of
the
affectionate
kiss
for
which
she
lifted
her
veil
janet
seemed
to
have
no
suspicion
whatever
we
were
just
off
to
hillport
said
janet
how
splendid
of
you
to
come
like
this
do
let
go
to
hillport
said
alicia
janet
hesitated
pulling
down
her
veil
of
course
you
must
go
hilda
said
positively
i
afraid
we
shall
have
to
go
said
janet
with
reluctance
you
see
it
the
marrions
edie
cousins
and
edie
will
be
there
who
edie
why
tom
fiancée
surely
i
told
you
yes
said
hilda
only
i
did
just
remember
the
name
how
nice
she
thought
no
sooner
do
i
get
here
than
i
talk
like
they
do
fancy
me
saying
nice
oh
it
all
edie
nowadays
said
alicia
lightly
we
have
to
be
frightfully
particular
or
else
tom
would
cut
our
heads
off
that
why
we
going
in
a
cab
we
should
have
walked
should
we
janet
only
it
would
never
do
for
us
to
to
the
marrions
at
night
misses
lessways
carriage
she
mimicked
and
finicked
about
on
her
toes
janet
was
precisely
the
same
as
ever
but
the
alicia
had
developed
her
childishness
was
now
shot
through
with
gestures
and
tones
of
the
young
girl
she
flushed
and
paled
continuously
and
was
acutely
and
somewhat
vain
but
not
offensively
vain
i
say
jan
she
exclaimed
why
should
hilda
come
with
us
to
the
marrions
oh
no
thanks
said
hilda
but
do
hilda
i
sure
they
be
delighted
janet
urged
i
never
thought
of
it
though
she
was
flattered
and
indeed
a
little
startled
by
the
extraordinary
seriousness
of
janet
insistence
hilda
shook
her
head
where
tom
she
inquired
to
change
the
subject
oh
alicia
burst
out
again
he
gone
off
ago
to
escort
his
ladylove
from
hanbridge
to
hillport
you
wait
till
you
engaged
alicia
janet
suggested
but
eyes
too
twinkled
the
admission
that
tom
was
just
then
providing
much
innocent
amusement
to
the
family
you
sleep
in
my
room
anyhow
dear
said
janet
when
martha
and
hilda
cabman
had
brought
a
trunk
into
the
hall
and
hilda
had
paid
the
cabman
far
more
than
his
fare
because
he
was
such
a
friendly
young
cabman
and
because
he
possessed
a
pulmonary
sweetheart
come
along
dear
alicia
ask
swindells
to
wait
a
minute
or
two
swindells
alicia
shouted
to
the
original
cabman
just
wait
a
jiff
yes
miss
the
original
cabman
being
old
and
accustomed
to
party
work
in
the
five
towns
knew
the
length
of
a
jiff
and
got
down
from
his
seat
to
exercise
both
arms
and
legs
with
sardonic
pleasure
he
watched
the
young
cabman
cut
a
black
streak
in
the
sodden
lawn
with
his
near
as
he
clumsily
turned
to
leave
then
martha
banged
the
front
door
and
another
servant
appeared
in
the
hall
to
help
the
trunk
on
its
way
upstairs
no
i
shall
never
be
able
to
tell
them
thought
hilda
following
the
trunk
alicia
had
scampered
on
in
front
of
the
trunk
to
inform
her
parents
of
the
arrival
orgreave
hilda
learnt
was
laid
up
with
an
attack
of
asthma
and
osmond
orgreave
was
working
in
their
bedroom
ii
hilda
stood
in
front
of
the
fire
in
janet
bedroom
and
janet
was
unlocking
her
trunk
why
what
a
pretty
bodice
said
janet
opening
the
trunk
she
stood
up
and
held
forth
the
bodice
to
inspect
it
and
beneath
janet
cloak
hilda
could
see
the
splendour
of
her
evening
dress
where
did
you
get
it
in
london
hilda
was
about
to
answer
but
she
took
thought
oh
brighton
it
was
a
lie
she
had
a
longing
to
say
no
not
brighton
what
am
i
thinking
of
i
got
it
in
london
on
my
honeymoon
what
a
unique
sensation
that
one
word
would
have
caused
but
she
could
not
find
courage
to
utter
it
alicia
came
importantly
in
mother
love
and
you
are
to
go
into
her
room
as
soon
as
you
ready
martha
will
bring
up
a
tray
for
you
and
you
eat
there
by
the
fire
it
all
arranged
and
what
about
father
love
hilda
demanded
with
a
sprightliness
that
astonished
herself
and
she
thought
why
are
these
people
so
fond
of
me
they
do
even
ask
how
it
was
i
did
write
to
tell
them
i
was
coming
they
just
accept
me
and
welcome
me
without
questions
no
i
can
never
tell
them
it
simply
could
be
told
here
if
they
find
out
so
much
the
worse
you
must
ask
him
alicia
answered
blushing
all
right
alicia
we
be
ready
in
a
minute
or
two
said
janet
in
a
peculiar
voice
it
was
a
gentle
command
to
alicia
to
leave
her
elders
alone
to
their
adult
confidences
and
unwilling
alicia
had
to
obey
but
there
were
no
confidences
the
talk
as
it
were
shivered
on
the
brink
of
a
confidence
but
never
plunged
does
she
guess
hilda
reflected
the
conversation
so
halted
that
at
length
janet
was
driven
to
the
banality
of
saying
i
so
sorry
we
have
to
go
out
and
hilda
protested
with
equal
banality
and
added
i
suppose
going
out
a
lot
just
now
oh
no
said
janet
we
go
out
less
and
less
and
we
get
quieter
and
quieter
i
mean
the
boys
are
always
out
you
know
she
seemed
saddened
i
did
think
edwin
clayhanger
would
come
in
sometimes
now
they
living
next
door
they
in
their
new
house
then
said
hilda
with
casualness
oh
long
ago
and
i
sure
it
ages
since
he
was
here
i
like
maggie
his
sister
hilda
knelt
to
her
trunk
did
he
ever
inquire
after
me
she
demanded
with
an
air
of
archness
but
hiding
her
face
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
once
said
janet
imitating
manner
well
that
something
said
hilda
there
was
a
sharp
knock
at
the
door
hot
water
miss
cried
the
voice
of
martha
the
next
instant
martha
was
arranging
the
ewer
and
the
can
and
some
clean
towels
on
the
washstand
her
face
was
full
of
joy
in
the
unexpected
arrival
she
was
as
excited
as
if
hilda
had
been
her
own
friend
instead
of
janet
well
dear
shall
you
be
all
right
now
said
janet
perhaps
i
ought
to
be
going
you
may
depend
on
it
i
shall
get
back
as
early
as
ever
i
can
the
two
girls
kissed
with
even
more
freedom
than
in
the
hall
it
seemed
astonishing
to
hilda
as
her
face
was
close
to
janet
that
janet
did
not
exclaim
something
has
happened
to
you
what
is
it
you
are
not
as
you
used
to
be
you
are
not
like
me
she
felt
herself
an
imposter
why
should
i
tell
hilda
reflected
what
end
will
it
serve
nobody
business
but
mine
is
gone
he
never
come
back
everything
over
and
if
it
does
get
about
well
they
only
praise
me
for
my
discretion
they
ca
do
anything
else
still
she
longed
timorously
to
confide
in
janet
and
when
janet
had
departed
she
breathed
relief
because
the
danger
of
confiding
in
janet
was
withdrawn
for
the
moment
iii
later
as
the
invalid
had
ordained
hilda
having
eaten
sat
by
the
fire
in
the
large
quiet
bedroom
of
and
orgreave
the
latter
was
enjoying
a
period
of
ease
and
lay
with
head
raised
very
high
on
pillows
in
her
own
half
of
the
broad
bed
the
quilt
extended
over
her
without
a
crease
in
its
expanse
the
sheet
was
turned
down
with
precision
making
a
level
white
border
to
the
quilt
and
orgreave
did
not
stir
not
one
of
her
grey
locks
stirred
she
spoke
occasionally
in
a
low
voice
on
the
stood
a
godfrey
chloride
of
ammonia
inhaler
with
its
glass
cylinder
and
triple
arrangement
of
tubes
there
was
only
this
and
the
dark
lips
and
pale
cheeks
of
the
patient
to
remind
the
beholder
that
not
long
since
the
bed
had
been
a
scene
of
agony
orgreave
in
bright
carpet
slippers
and
elegant
wristbands
blossoming
out
of
the
sleeves
of
his
black
stood
bending
above
a
huge
board
that
was
laid
horizontally
on
trestles
to
the
left
of
the
fireplace
this
board
was
covered
by
a
wide
length
of
bluish
transparent
paper
which
at
intervals
he
pulled
towards
him
making
billows
of
paper
at
his
feet
and
gradually
lessening
a
roll
of
it
that
lay
on
the
floor
beyond
the
table
a
specially
arranged
with
a
green
shade
which
threw
a
powerful
light
on
the
paper
showed
that
osmond
orgreave
habit
was
to
work
in
that
spot
of
an
evening
astonishing
i
have
to
do
this
myself
is
it
he
observed
stooping
to
roll
up
the
accumulated
length
of
paper
about
his
feet
what
is
it
hilda
asked
it
a
detail
drawing
simple
but
do
you
suppose
i
could
trust
either
of
my
ingenious
sons
to
get
the
curves
of
the
mouldings
right
you
never
be
able
to
trust
them
unless
you
begin
to
trust
them
said
orgreave
sagely
from
the
bed
ha
ejaculated
osmond
orgreave
satirically
this
remark
was
one
of
his
most
effective
counters
to
argument
the
fact
is
he
thoroughly
enjoys
it
does
he
mrs
orgreave
said
hilda
you
quite
right
my
dear
said
orgreave
ah
from
orgreave
he
sketched
with
a
pencil
and
rubbed
out
vigorously
then
his
eye
caught
hilda
and
they
both
smiled
very
content
they
look
nice
if
i
took
to
drink
instead
of
to
work
for
a
change
he
murmured
pausing
to
caress
his
handsome
hair
there
was
a
sharp
knock
at
the
door
and
into
this
room
also
the
watchful
martha
entered
here
the
sir
the
boy
only
just
brought
it
give
it
to
miss
hilda
said
orgreave
without
glancing
up
shall
i
take
the
tray
away
martha
inquired
looking
towards
the
bed
the
supreme
centre
of
domestic
order
and
authority
perhaps
miss
hilda
has
finished
oh
yes
i
have
thanks
martha
rearranged
the
vessels
and
cutlery
upon
the
tray
with
quick
expert
movements
of
the
wrists
her
gaze
was
carefully
fixed
on
the
tray
endowed
though
she
was
with
rare
privileges
as
a
faithful
retainer
she
would
have
been
shocked
and
shamed
had
her
gaze
improperly
wandering
encountered
the
gaze
of
the
master
or
the
guest
then
she
picked
up
the
tray
and
pushing
the
small
table
into
its
accustomed
place
with
a
deft
twist
of
the
foot
she
sailed
erect
and
prim
out
of
the
room
and
the
door
primly
clicked
on
her
waist
and
flying
white
ribbons
and
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
hilda
asked
fingering
the
white
damp
paper
i
should
like
you
to
read
us
about
the
strike
said
orgreave
it
a
dreadful
thing
i
should
thing
it
was
hilda
agreed
fervently
oh
do
you
know
on
the
way
from
shawport
i
saw
a
procession
of
the
men
and
anything
more
terrible
it
the
children
i
think
of
said
orgreave
softly
pity
the
men
do
orgreave
murmured
without
raising
his
head
do
what
hilda
asked
defiantly
think
of
the
children
bridling
but
silent
hilda
opened
the
sheet
and
searched
round
and
about
its
columns
with
the
embarrassed
bewilderment
of
one
unaccustomed
to
the
perusal
of
newspapers
look
on
page
three
first
column
said
orgreave
that
all
about
racing
said
hilda
oh
dear
dear
from
the
bed
well
second
column
the
potters
strike
the
men
leaders
she
read
the
headlines
there
is
much
of
it
how
beautifully
clearly
you
read
said
orgreave
with
mild
enthusiasm
when
hilda
had
read
the
meagre
do
i
hilda
flushed
is
that
all
there
is
about
it
yes
they
do
seem
to
think
it
very
important
that
half
the
people
are
starving
hilda
sneered
whose
fault
is
it
if
they
do
starve
osmond
orgreave
glanced
at
her
with
lowered
head
i
think
it
a
shame
she
exclaimed
do
you
know
that
the
men
broke
the
last
award
not
so
very
long
since
said
osmond
orgreave
what
can
you
do
with
such
people
broke
the
last
award
she
was
checked
broke
the
last
award
would
stick
by
their
own
agreement
their
own
words
i
just
tell
you
a
wise
young
woman
like
you
ought
to
be
carried
away
by
the
sight
of
a
procession
on
a
cold
night
he
smiled
and
she
smiled
but
awkwardly
and
then
he
told
her
something
of
the
case
for
the
employers
how
hard
you
are
on
the
men
she
protested
when
he
had
done
not
at
all
not
at
all
he
stretched
himself
and
came
round
his
trestles
to
poke
the
fire
you
should
hear
clayhanger
on
the
men
if
you
want
to
know
what
hard
is
clayhanger
you
mean
old
mr
clayhanger
yes
but
he
is
a
manufacturer
no
but
he
an
employer
of
labour
hilda
rose
uneasily
from
her
chair
and
walked
towards
the
distant
shadowed
i
should
like
to
go
over
a
she
said
abruptly
very
easy
said
orgreave
resuming
his
work
with
a
great
expulsion
of
breath
hilda
thought
why
did
i
say
that
and
to
cover
her
constraint
she
cried
out
oh
what
a
lovely
book
a
small
book
bound
in
full
purple
calf
lay
half
hidden
in
a
nest
of
fine
tissue
paper
on
the
yes
is
it
said
orgreave
tom
brought
it
in
to
show
me
before
he
went
this
afternoon
it
a
birthday
present
for
edie
had
it
specially
bound
i
must
write
myself
and
ask
edie
to
come
over
and
meet
you
i
sure
you
like
her
she
a
dear
girl
i
think
very
fortunate
no
you
do
osmond
orgreave
contradicted
her
with
a
great
rustling
of
paper
you
think
edie
very
fortunate
hilda
looked
round
and
caught
the
architect
smile
i
think
they
both
fortunate
said
orgreave
simply
she
had
almost
no
sense
of
humour
i
sure
she
a
real
good
girl
and
clever
too
clever
enough
to
get
on
the
right
side
of
her
future
anyway
growled
orgreave
anyone
might
think
osmond
did
like
the
girl
said
orgreave
from
the
way
he
talks
and
yet
he
adores
her
and
it
no
use
him
pretending
he
does
i
only
adore
you
said
osmond
you
need
try
to
turn
it
off
his
wife
murmured
beaming
on
hilda
tears
came
strangely
into
hilda
eyes
and
she
turned
again
to
the
and
through
a
blur
she
saw
all
the
objects
ranged
in
a
long
row
on
the
white
cloth
that
covered
the
rosewood
and
she
thought
all
this
is
beautiful
and
she
saw
the
pale
blinds
drawn
down
behind
the
and
the
valance
at
the
top
and
the
draped
curtains
and
herself
darkly
in
the
glass
and
she
could
feel
the
vista
of
the
large
calm
comfortable
room
behind
her
and
could
hear
the
coals
falling
together
in
the
grate
and
the
rustling
of
the
paper
and
orgreave
slight
cough
and
in
her
mind
she
could
see
all
the
other
rooms
in
the
spacious
house
and
the
dim
misted
garden
beyond
she
thought
all
this
house
is
beautiful
it
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
i
have
ever
known
or
ever
shall
know
i
happy
here
and
then
her
imagination
followed
each
of
the
children
she
imagined
marian
the
eldest
and
her
babies
in
london
and
charlie
also
in
london
practising
medicine
and
tom
and
janet
and
alicia
at
the
party
at
hillport
and
jimmie
and
johnnie
seeing
life
at
hanbridge
while
the
parents
remained
in
tranquillity
in
their
bedroom
all
these
visions
were
beautiful
even
the
vision
of
jimmie
and
johnnie
flourishing
and
glasses
and
pipes
in
the
smoky
atmosphere
of
a
club
even
this
was
beautiful
it
was
as
simply
touching
as
the
other
visions
and
she
was
at
home
with
the
parents
and
so
extremely
intimate
with
them
that
she
could
nearly
conceive
herself
a
genuine
member
of
the
house
she
was
in
bliss
her
immediate
past
dropped
away
from
her
like
an
illusion
and
she
became
almost
the
old
hilda
she
was
almost
born
again
into
innocence
only
the
tragic
figure
of
george
cannon
hung
vague
in
the
far
distance
of
memory
and
the
sight
thereof
constricted
her
heart
utterly
her
passion
for
him
had
expired
she
was
exquisitely
sad
for
him
she
felt
towards
him
kindly
and
guiltily
as
one
feels
towards
an
old
error
and
withal
the
spell
of
the
home
of
the
orgreaves
took
away
his
reality
she
was
fingering
the
book
its
ran
english
poems
of
richard
now
she
had
never
even
heard
of
richard
crashaw
and
she
wondered
who
he
might
be
turning
the
pages
she
read
all
thy
old
woes
shall
now
smile
on
thee
and
thy
pains
sit
bright
upon
thee
all
thy
sorrows
here
shall
shine
all
thy
sufferings
be
divine
tears
shall
take
comfort
and
turn
gems
and
wrongs
repent
to
diadems
and
she
read
again
as
though
the
words
had
been
too
lovely
to
be
real
and
she
must
assure
herself
of
them
tears
shall
take
comfort
and
turn
gems
and
wrongs
repent
to
diadems
she
turned
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
poem
and
read
the
title
of
it
a
hymn
to
the
name
and
honour
of
the
admirable
saint
teresa
foundress
of
the
reformation
of
the
discalced
carmelites
both
men
and
women
a
woman
for
angelical
height
of
speculation
for
masculine
courage
of
performance
more
than
a
woman
who
yet
a
child
outran
maturity
and
durst
plot
a
martyrdom
the
prose
thrilled
her
even
more
intimately
than
the
verse
she
cried
within
herself
why
have
i
never
heard
of
richard
crashaw
why
did
tom
never
tell
me
she
became
upon
the
instant
a
devotee
of
this
saint
teresa
she
thought
inconsequently
with
a
pang
that
was
also
a
reassurance
george
cannon
would
never
have
understood
this
but
everyone
here
understands
it
and
with
hands
enfevered
she
turned
the
pages
again
and
after
several
disappointments
read
oh
thou
undaunted
daughter
of
desires
by
all
thy
dower
of
lights
and
fires
by
all
the
eagle
in
thee
all
the
dove
by
all
thy
lives
and
deaths
of
love
by
thy
large
draughts
of
intellectual
day
and
by
thy
thirsts
of
love
more
large
than
they
by
all
thy
bowls
of
fierce
desire
by
this
last
morning
draught
of
liquid
fire
by
the
full
kingdom
of
that
final
kiss
she
ceased
to
read
it
was
as
if
her
soul
was
crying
out
i
also
am
teresa
this
is
i
this
is
i
and
then
the
door
opened
and
martha
appeared
once
more
if
you
please
sir
edwin
clayhanger
called
oh
well
i
nearly
finished
where
is
he
in
the
sir
well
tell
him
i
be
down
in
a
minute
hilda
said
orgreave
will
mind
going
and
telling
him
hilda
had
replaced
the
book
in
its
nest
and
gone
quickly
back
to
her
chair
the
entrance
of
the
servant
at
that
moment
to
announce
edwin
clayhanger
seemed
to
her
startlingly
dramatic
what
she
thought
i
am
just
reading
that
and
he
comes
he
has
been
here
for
ages
and
on
the
very
night
that
i
come
he
comes
certainly
she
replied
to
orgreave
and
she
thought
this
is
the
second
time
she
has
sent
me
with
a
message
to
edwin
clayhanger
suddenly
she
blushed
in
confusion
before
the
mistress
of
the
home
is
it
possible
she
asked
herself
is
it
possible
that
orgreave
does
guess
what
has
happened
to
me
is
it
possible
she
ca
see
that
i
different
from
what
i
used
to
be
if
she
knew
if
they
knew
here
she
left
the
room
like
a
criminal
when
she
was
going
down
the
stairs
she
discovered
that
she
held
the
in
her
hand
she
had
no
recollection
of
picking
it
up
and
there
was
no
object
in
taking
it
to
the
she
thought
what
a
state
i
must
be
in
chapter
ii
a
rendezvous
i
i
suppose
you
never
thought
about
me
once
since
i
left
she
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
in
the
small
shelved
and
she
shot
these
words
at
edwin
clayhanger
who
was
standing
near
her
the
singular
words
were
certainly
uttered
out
of
bravado
they
were
a
challenge
to
adventure
she
thought
it
is
madness
for
me
to
say
such
a
thing
but
such
a
thing
had
nevertheless
come
quite
glibly
out
of
her
mouth
and
she
knew
not
why
if
edwin
clayhanger
was
startled
so
was
she
startled
oh
yes
i
have
he
stammered
of
course
she
had
put
him
out
of
countenance
she
smiled
and
said
persuasively
but
you
never
inquired
after
me
yes
i
have
he
answered
with
a
hint
of
defiance
after
a
pause
only
once
she
continued
to
smile
how
do
you
know
he
demanded
then
she
told
him
very
calmly
extinguishing
the
smile
that
her
source
of
information
was
janet
that
nothing
to
go
by
he
exclaimed
with
sudden
roughness
nothing
to
go
by
the
number
of
i
inquired
ii
she
was
silenced
she
thought
if
i
am
thus
intimate
with
him
it
must
be
because
of
the
talk
we
had
in
the
garden
that
night
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
scene
in
the
garden
had
somehow
bound
them
together
for
ever
in
intimacy
that
even
if
they
pretended
to
be
only
acquaintances
they
would
constantly
be
breaking
through
the
thin
shell
of
formality
into
some
unguessed
deep
of
intimacy
she
regarded
surreptitiously
his
face
with
a
keen
sense
of
pleasure
it
was
romantic
melancholy
wistful
enigmatic
and
above
all
honest
she
knew
that
he
had
desired
to
be
an
architect
and
that
his
father
had
thwarted
his
desire
and
this
fact
endowed
him
for
her
with
the
charm
of
a
victim
the
idea
that
all
his
life
had
been
embittered
and
shadowed
by
the
caprice
of
an
old
man
was
beautiful
to
her
in
its
sadness
she
contemplated
it
with
vague
bliss
at
their
last
meeting
during
the
sunday
school
centenary
he
had
annoyed
her
he
had
even
drawn
her
disdain
by
his
lack
of
initiative
and
male
force
in
the
incident
of
the
senile
sunday
school
teacher
he
had
profoundly
disappointed
her
now
she
simply
forgot
this
the
sinister
impression
vanished
from
her
mind
she
recalled
her
first
vision
of
him
in
the
lighted
doorway
of
his
father
shop
her
present
vision
confirmed
that
sympathetic
vision
she
liked
the
feel
of
his
faithful
hand
and
the
glance
of
his
timid
and
yet
bellicose
eye
and
she
reposed
on
his
very
apparent
honesty
as
on
a
bed
she
knew
with
the
assurance
of
perfect
faith
that
he
had
nothing
dubious
to
conceal
and
that
no
test
could
strain
his
magnanimity
and
while
she
so
reflected
she
was
thinking
too
of
janet
fine
dress
and
her
elegance
and
jewels
and
wishing
that
she
had
changed
the
old
black
frock
in
which
she
travelled
the
perception
that
she
could
never
be
like
janet
cast
her
down
but
the
next
moment
she
was
saying
to
herself
proudly
what
does
it
matter
why
should
i
be
like
janet
and
the
next
moment
after
that
she
was
saying
in
another
phase
of
her
pride
i
be
like
janet
they
began
to
discuss
the
strike
it
was
a
topic
which
during
those
weeks
could
not
be
avoided
either
by
the
rich
or
by
the
poor
i
suppose
you
like
all
the
rest
against
the
men
she
challenged
him
again
inviting
battle
he
replied
bluntly
what
earthly
right
have
you
to
suppose
that
like
all
the
rest
she
bent
her
head
lower
so
that
she
could
only
see
him
through
the
veil
of
her
eyelashes
i
very
sorry
she
said
in
a
low
smiling
meditative
voice
i
knew
all
the
time
you
were
the
thought
shot
through
her
mind
like
a
lance
it
is
incredible
and
horribly
dangerous
that
i
should
be
sitting
here
with
him
after
all
that
has
happened
to
me
and
him
without
the
slightest
suspicion
and
yet
what
can
stop
it
from
coming
out
sooner
or
later
nothing
can
stop
it
edwin
clayhanger
continued
to
talk
of
the
strike
and
she
heard
him
saying
if
you
ask
me
i
tell
you
what
i
think
workmen
on
strike
are
always
in
the
right
you
only
got
to
look
at
them
in
a
crowd
together
they
do
starve
themselves
for
fun
what
he
said
thrilled
her
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
there
was
everything
in
it
his
generosity
towards
the
oppressed
was
everything
to
her
his
whole
attitude
was
utterly
and
mysteriously
different
from
that
of
any
other
man
whom
she
had
known
and
with
that
simple
wistful
expression
of
his
they
went
on
talking
and
then
following
in
secret
the
train
of
her
own
thoughts
she
suddenly
burst
out
i
never
met
anybody
like
you
before
a
pause
ensued
no
never
she
added
with
intense
conviction
i
might
say
the
same
of
you
he
replied
moved
oh
no
i
nothing
she
breathed
she
glanced
up
exquisitely
flattered
his
face
was
crimson
exquisite
moment
in
the
familiarity
of
the
by
the
fire
she
on
the
sofa
with
him
standing
over
her
a
delicious
peril
the
crimson
slowly
paled
iii
osmond
orgreave
entered
the
room
quizzical
and
at
once
began
to
tease
clayhanger
about
the
infrequency
of
his
visits
turning
to
hilda
he
said
he
scarcely
ever
comes
to
see
us
except
when
you
here
it
was
just
as
if
he
had
said
i
heard
every
word
you
spoke
before
i
came
in
and
i
have
read
your
hearts
both
hilda
and
clayhanger
were
disconcerted
clayhanger
extremely
so
steady
on
he
protested
uncouthly
and
then
with
the
most
naïve
ingenuousness
orgreave
better
but
osmond
orgreave
was
not
in
a
merciful
mood
a
moment
later
he
was
saying
has
she
told
you
she
wants
to
go
over
a
no
clayhanger
answered
with
interest
but
i
shall
be
very
pleased
to
show
her
over
ours
any
time
hilda
struck
into
silence
made
no
response
and
instantly
clayhanger
finished
in
another
tone
look
here
i
must
be
off
i
only
slipped
in
for
a
minute
really
and
he
went
declining
orgreave
request
to
give
a
date
for
his
next
call
the
bang
of
the
front
door
resounded
through
the
house
orgreave
having
taken
clayhanger
to
the
front
door
did
not
return
immediately
into
the
hilda
jumped
up
from
the
sofa
hesitant
she
was
disappointed
she
was
even
resentful
assuredly
she
was
humiliated
oh
no
she
thought
he
weak
and
afraid
i
dare
say
he
went
off
because
janet
was
here
she
heard
through
the
door
orgreave
slippers
on
the
tiles
of
the
passage
leading
to
the
stairs
martha
came
into
the
room
with
a
delighted
curious
smile
if
you
please
miss
could
you
come
into
the
hall
a
minute
some
one
to
speak
to
you
hilda
blushed
silently
and
obeyed
clayhanger
was
standing
in
the
chill
hall
hat
in
hand
her
heart
jumped
when
will
you
come
to
look
over
our
works
he
muttered
rapidly
and
very
nervously
and
yet
with
a
dictatorial
gruffness
i
should
like
you
to
come
he
had
put
an
enchantment
upon
her
by
this
marvellous
return
and
to
conceal
from
him
what
he
had
done
she
frowned
and
kept
silent
what
time
she
asked
suddenly
any
time
his
eagerness
was
thrilling
oh
no
you
must
fix
the
time
say
between
six
and
a
quarter
to
seven
that
do
she
nodded
their
hands
met
he
said
adieu
he
pulled
open
the
heavy
door
she
saw
his
back
for
an
instant
against
the
pale
gloom
of
the
garden
in
which
vapour
was
curling
and
then
she
had
shut
the
door
and
was
standing
alone
in
the
confined
hall
a
miracle
had
occurred
and
it
intimidated
her
and
amid
her
wondrous
fears
she
was
steeped
in
the
unique
sense
of
adventure
this
morning
i
was
in
brighton
she
thought
half
an
hour
ago
i
had
no
notion
of
seeing
him
and
now
and
the
tragic
sequel
to
one
adventure
had
not
impaired
her
instinct
for
experience
on
the
contrary
it
had
strengthened
it
the
very
failure
of
the
one
excited
her
towards
another
the
zest
of
living
was
reborn
in
her
the
morrow
beckoned
her
golden
and
miraculous
the
faculty
of
men
and
women
to
create
their
own
lives
seemed
divine
and
the
conception
of
it
enfevered
her
chapter
iii
at
the
works
i
that
night
late
hilda
and
janet
shut
themselves
up
in
the
bedroom
together
the
door
clicked
softly
under
janet
gentle
push
and
they
were
as
safe
from
invasion
as
if
the
door
had
been
of
iron
and
locked
and
and
barred
with
bars
of
iron
alicia
alone
might
have
disturbed
them
but
alicia
was
asleep
hilda
had
a
sense
of
entire
security
in
this
room
such
as
she
had
never
had
since
she
drove
away
from
lessways
street
turnhill
early
one
morning
with
florrie
bagster
in
a
cab
it
was
not
that
there
had
been
the
least
real
fear
of
any
room
of
hers
being
attacked
it
was
that
this
room
seemed
to
have
been
rendered
mystically
inviolate
by
long
years
of
janet
occupation
janet
bedroom
the
phrase
had
a
sanction
which
could
not
possibly
have
attached
itself
to
for
instance
hilda
bedroom
nor
even
to
mother
bedroom
mother
bedroom
being
indeed
at
the
mercy
of
any
profane
and
marauding
member
of
the
family
a
sort
of
for
the
transaction
of
affairs
and
further
janet
bedroom
was
distinguished
and
made
delicious
for
hilda
by
its
fire
it
happened
to
be
one
of
the
very
few
bedrooms
in
the
five
towns
at
that
date
with
a
fire
as
a
regular
feature
of
it
orgreave
had
a
fire
in
the
parental
bedroom
when
she
could
not
reasonably
do
without
it
but
osmond
orgreave
suffered
the
fire
rather
than
enjoyed
it
as
for
tom
though
of
a
shivery
disposition
he
would
have
dithered
to
death
before
admitting
that
a
bedroom
fire
might
increase
his
comfort
johnnie
and
jimmie
genuinely
liked
to
be
cold
in
their
bedroom
alicia
pined
for
a
fire
but
orgreave
imitating
the
contrariety
of
fate
forbade
a
fire
to
alicia
and
one
consequence
of
this
was
that
alicia
sometimes
undressed
in
janet
bedroom
making
afterwards
a
dash
for
the
pole
the
idea
of
a
bedroom
was
always
during
nearly
half
the
year
associated
with
the
idea
of
discomfort
in
mind
and
now
in
janet
bedroom
impressed
as
she
was
by
the
strangeness
of
the
fact
that
the
prime
reason
for
hurrying
at
into
bed
had
been
abolished
she
yet
positively
could
not
linger
the
force
of
habit
being
too
strong
for
her
and
she
was
in
bed
despite
efforts
to
dawdle
while
janet
was
still
brushing
her
hair
as
she
lay
and
watched
janet
complex
unrobing
she
acquired
knowledge
and
once
more
she
found
herself
desiring
to
be
like
janet
not
only
in
appearance
but
in
soft
manner
and
tone
she
thought
how
shall
i
dress
afternoon
all
the
operations
of
her
brain
related
themselves
somehow
to
afternoon
the
anticipation
of
the
visit
to
the
burned
in
her
heart
like
a
steady
lamp
that
shone
through
the
brief
cloudy
interests
of
the
moment
and
edwin
clayhanger
was
precisely
the
topic
which
janet
seemed
as
it
were
expressly
to
avoid
janet
inquired
concerning
life
at
brighton
and
the
health
of
sarah
gailey
janet
even
mentioned
george
cannon
hilda
steadied
her
voice
in
replying
though
she
was
not
really
apprehensive
for
janet
questions
like
the
questions
of
the
whole
family
were
invariably
discreet
and
respectful
of
the
individual
privacy
but
of
edwin
clayhanger
whose
visit
nevertheless
had
been
recounted
to
her
in
the
on
her
return
janet
said
not
a
word
and
then
when
she
had
extinguished
the
gas
and
the
oriental
sleeve
of
her
silk
nightgown
delicately
brushed
hilda
face
as
she
got
into
bed
she
remarked
strange
that
edwin
clayhanger
should
call
just
hilda
cheek
warmed
he
asked
me
to
go
and
look
over
their
said
she
quickly
janet
was
taken
aback
really
she
exclaimed
unmistakably
startled
she
spoke
a
second
too
soon
if
she
had
delayed
only
one
second
she
might
have
concealed
from
hilda
that
which
hilda
had
most
plainly
perceived
to
wit
anxiety
and
jealousy
yes
jealousy
in
this
adorably
benevolent
creature
tone
hilda
interest
in
afternoon
was
intensified
shall
you
be
able
to
come
she
asked
what
time
he
said
about
six
or
a
quarter
to
seven
i
ca
said
janet
dreamily
because
of
that
musical
society
meeting
you
know
i
told
you
did
i
in
the
faint
light
of
the
dying
fire
hilda
made
out
little
by
little
the
mysterious
pale
heaps
of
clothes
and
all
the
details
of
the
room
strewn
and
disordered
by
reason
of
an
additional
occupant
the
adventure
was
now
of
infinite
complexity
and
its
complexity
seemed
to
be
symbolized
by
the
suggestive
feminine
mysteriousness
of
what
she
saw
and
what
she
divined
in
the
darkness
of
the
chamber
she
thought
i
am
here
on
false
pretences
i
ought
to
tell
my
secret
that
would
be
fair
i
have
no
right
to
intrude
between
her
and
him
but
she
instinctively
and
powerfully
resisted
such
ideas
with
firmness
she
put
them
away
and
yielded
herself
with
a
more
exquisite
apprehension
to
the
anticipation
of
ii
the
order
of
meals
at
lane
end
was
somewhat
peculiar
even
then
and
would
now
be
almost
unique
it
was
partly
the
natural
expression
of
an
instinctive
and
justified
feeling
of
superiority
and
partly
due
to
a
discretion
which
forbade
the
family
to
scandalize
the
professional
classes
of
the
district
by
dining
at
night
dinner
occurred
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
about
nine
in
the
evening
was
an
informal
but
copious
supper
between
those
two
meals
there
came
a
tea
which
was
neither
high
or
low
and
whose
hour
six
in
theory
depended
to
a
certain
extent
in
practice
on
orgreave
arrival
from
the
office
not
seldom
orgreave
was
late
occasionally
he
was
very
late
the
kitchen
waited
to
infuse
the
tea
until
a
command
came
from
some
woman
old
or
young
who
attentively
watched
a
window
for
a
particular
swinging
of
the
long
gate
at
the
end
of
the
garden
or
listened
when
it
was
dark
for
the
bang
of
the
gate
and
a
particular
crunching
of
gravel
on
this
tuesday
evening
osmond
orgreave
was
very
late
and
the
movement
of
the
household
was
less
smooth
than
usual
owing
to
illness
and
to
the
absence
of
janet
at
hillport
in
connection
with
the
projected
hillport
choral
society
had
janet
been
warned
of
visit
she
would
not
have
accepted
an
invitation
to
a
tea
at
hillport
as
a
preliminary
to
the
meeting
of
the
provisional
committee
hilda
was
in
a
state
of
acute
distress
the
appointment
with
edwin
clayhanger
seemed
to
be
absolutely
sacred
to
her
to
be
late
for
it
would
amount
to
a
crime
to
miss
it
altogether
would
be
a
calamity
inconceivable
the
fingers
of
all
the
clocks
in
the
house
were
revolving
with
the
most
extraordinary
rapidity
she
was
helpless
she
was
helpless
because
she
had
said
nothing
all
day
of
her
appointment
and
because
janet
had
not
mentioned
it
either
janet
might
have
said
before
leaving
tea
had
better
not
wait
too
long
hilda
has
to
be
down
at
clayhanger
at
six
janet
silence
impressed
hilda
it
was
not
merely
strange
it
was
formidable
it
affected
the
whole
day
hilda
thought
is
she
determined
not
to
speak
of
it
unless
i
do
immediately
janet
was
gone
hilda
had
run
up
to
the
bedroom
she
was
minded
to
change
the
black
frock
which
she
had
been
wearing
and
which
she
hated
and
to
put
on
another
skirt
and
bodice
that
janet
had
praised
she
longed
to
beautify
herself
and
yet
she
was
still
hesitating
about
it
at
five
in
the
evening
as
she
had
hesitated
at
eight
in
the
morning
in
the
end
she
had
decided
not
to
change
an
account
of
the
rain
but
the
rain
had
naught
to
do
with
her
decision
she
would
not
change
because
she
was
too
proud
to
change
she
would
go
just
as
she
was
she
could
not
accept
the
assistance
of
an
attractive
bodice
unfeminine
perhaps
but
womanly
at
minutes
to
seven
she
went
into
orgreave
bedroom
rather
like
a
child
and
also
rather
like
an
adult
creature
in
a
distracting
crisis
tom
orgreave
and
alicia
were
filling
the
entire
house
with
the
stormy
noise
of
a
piano
duet
based
upon
i
think
i
miss
tea
orgreave
she
said
edwin
clayhanger
invited
me
to
go
over
the
at
six
and
minutes
to
seven
now
oh
but
my
dear
cried
orgreave
why
ever
did
you
tell
them
downstairs
or
let
me
know
earlier
and
she
pulled
at
the
that
overhung
the
head
of
the
bed
not
a
trace
of
teasing
archness
in
her
manner
hilda
appointment
might
have
been
of
the
most
serious
business
interest
for
anything
demeanor
indicated
to
the
contrary
hilda
stood
mute
and
constrained
you
run
down
and
tell
them
to
make
tea
at
once
dear
i
ca
let
you
go
without
anything
at
all
i
wonder
what
can
have
kept
osmond
almost
at
the
same
moment
osmond
orgreave
entered
the
bedroom
his
arrival
had
been
unnoticed
amid
the
tremendous
resounding
of
the
duet
oh
osmond
said
his
wife
wherever
have
you
been
so
late
hilda
wants
to
go
edwin
clayhanger
has
invited
her
to
go
over
the
works
hilda
trembling
at
the
door
more
than
half
expected
orgreave
to
say
you
mean
she
invited
herself
but
osmond
received
the
information
with
exactly
the
same
polite
apologetic
seriousness
as
his
wife
and
reassured
hilda
departed
from
the
room
ten
minutes
later
veiled
and
cloaked
she
stepped
out
alone
into
the
garden
and
instantly
her
torment
was
assuaged
and
she
was
happy
she
waited
at
the
corner
of
the
street
for
the
but
when
the
car
came
thundering
down
it
was
crammed
to
the
step
with
a
melancholy
gesture
the
driver
declined
her
signal
she
set
off
down
trafalgar
road
in
the
mist
and
the
rain
glad
that
she
had
been
compelled
to
walk
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
on
a
secret
and
mystic
errand
this
was
not
surprising
the
remarkable
thing
was
that
all
the
hurrying
people
she
met
seemed
also
each
of
them
to
be
on
a
secret
and
mystic
errand
the
shining
wet
pavement
was
dotted
with
dark
figures
suggestive
and
enigmatic
who
glided
over
a
floor
that
was
pierced
by
perpendicular
reflections
iii
in
the
clayhanger
shop
agitated
and
scarcely
aware
of
what
she
did
she
could
nevertheless
hear
her
voice
greeting
edwin
clayhanger
in
firm
calm
tones
and
she
soon
perceived
very
clearly
that
he
was
even
more
acutely
nervous
than
herself
which
perception
helped
to
restore
her
confidence
while
at
the
same
time
it
filled
her
with
bliss
the
young
fair
man
with
his
awkward
and
constrained
movements
took
possession
of
her
umbrella
and
then
suggested
that
she
should
remove
her
mackintosh
she
obeyed
timid
and
glad
she
stripped
off
her
mackintosh
as
though
she
were
stripping
off
her
modesty
and
stood
before
him
revealed
to
complete
the
sacrifice
she
raised
her
veil
and
smiled
up
at
him
as
it
were
asking
what
next
then
a
fat
untidy
old
man
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
a
cubicle
within
the
shop
and
edwin
clayhanger
blushed
father
this
is
miss
lessways
miss
lessways
my
father
she
she
come
to
look
over
the
place
d
miss
she
shook
hands
with
the
tyrannic
father
who
was
however
despite
his
reputation
apparently
just
as
nervous
as
the
son
there
followed
a
most
sinister
moment
of
silence
and
at
last
the
shop
door
opened
and
the
father
turned
to
greet
a
customer
hilda
thought
suppose
this
fat
old
man
is
one
day
my
is
it
possible
to
imagine
him
as
a
and
she
had
a
transient
gleam
of
curiosity
concerning
the
characters
of
the
two
clayhanger
sisters
and
recalled
with
satisfaction
that
janet
liked
the
elder
one
edwin
clayhanger
muttering
pointed
to
an
aperture
in
the
counter
and
immediately
she
was
going
through
it
with
him
and
through
a
door
at
the
back
of
the
shop
they
were
alone
facing
a
yard
edwin
clayhanger
sneezed
violently
it
keeps
on
raining
edwin
murmured
better
to
have
kept
umbrella
however
he
glanced
at
her
inquiringly
and
invitingly
they
ran
side
by
side
across
the
yard
to
a
roofed
flight
of
steps
that
led
to
the
office
for
a
couple
of
seconds
the
rain
wet
them
and
then
they
were
under
cover
again
it
seemed
to
hilda
that
they
had
escaped
from
the
shop
like
like
two
friendly
dogs
from
the
surveillance
of
an
incalculable
and
dangerous
old
man
she
felt
a
comfortable
friendly
confidence
in
edwin
clayhanger
a
tranquil
sentiment
such
as
she
had
never
experienced
for
george
cannon
after
more
than
a
year
and
what
a
period
of
unforeseen
happenings
she
thought
again
i
not
love
she
thought
but
liking
she
liked
being
with
him
she
liked
the
sensation
of
putting
confidence
in
him
she
liked
his
youth
and
her
own
she
was
sorry
because
he
had
a
cold
and
was
not
taking
care
of
it
now
they
were
climbing
a
sombre
creaking
staircase
towards
a
new
and
remote
world
that
was
separated
from
the
common
world
just
quitted
by
the
adventurous
passage
of
the
rainy
yard
and
now
they
were
amid
oily
odours
in
a
large
raftered
workshop
full
of
machines
the
an
enormous
but
very
deferential
man
saluted
them
with
majestic
solemnity
he
was
the
foreman
and
labelled
by
his
white
apron
as
an
artisan
but
his
gigantic
bulk
he
would
have
outweighed
the
pair
of
them
and
his
age
set
him
somehow
over
them
so
that
they
were
a
couple
of
striplings
in
his
vasty
presence
when
edwin
clayhanger
employed
as
it
were
daringly
the
accents
of
a
master
to
this
intimidating
fellow
hilda
thrilled
with
pleasure
at
the
piquancy
of
the
spectacle
and
she
was
admiringly
proud
of
edwin
the
foreman
immense
voice
explaining
machines
and
tools
caused
physical
vibrations
in
her
but
she
understood
nothing
of
what
he
said
nothing
whatever
she
was
in
a
dream
of
oily
odours
and
monstrous
iron
constructions
dominated
by
the
grand
foreman
and
edwin
was
in
the
dream
she
began
talking
quite
wildly
of
the
anniversary
of
the
inventor
of
printing
of
which
she
had
read
in
cranswick
history
at
brighton
brighton
had
sunk
away
over
the
verge
of
memory
even
lane
end
house
was
lost
somewhere
in
the
vague
past
all
her
previous
life
had
faded
she
reflected
guiltily
he
bound
to
think
i
been
reading
about
printing
because
i
was
interested
in
i
do
care
i
hope
he
does
think
it
she
heard
a
suggestion
that
as
it
was
too
late
that
night
to
see
the
largest
machine
in
motion
she
might
call
the
next
afternoon
she
at
once
promised
to
come
she
impatiently
desired
now
to
leave
the
room
where
they
were
and
to
see
something
else
and
then
she
feared
lest
this
might
be
all
there
was
to
see
edwin
clayhanger
was
edging
towards
the
door
they
were
alone
on
the
stairway
again
the
foreman
had
bowed
at
the
top
like
a
chamberlain
she
gathered
with
delicious
anticipation
that
other
and
still
more
recondite
interiors
awaited
their
visit
iv
they
were
in
an
attic
which
was
used
for
the
storage
of
reams
upon
reams
of
paper
by
the
light
of
a
candle
in
a
tin
candlestick
they
had
passed
alone
together
through
corridors
and
up
flights
of
stairs
at
the
back
of
the
shop
she
had
seen
everything
that
was
connected
with
the
enterprise
of
and
now
they
were
at
the
top
of
the
old
house
and
at
the
end
of
the
excursion
i
used
to
work
here
said
edwin
clayhanger
she
inquired
about
the
work
well
he
drawled
reading
and
writing
you
know
at
that
very
table
in
the
aperture
of
the
window
amid
piles
of
paper
stood
a
rickety
old
table
covered
with
dust
but
there
no
fireplace
she
said
glancing
round
the
room
and
then
directly
at
him
i
know
but
how
did
you
do
in
winter
she
eagerly
appealed
and
he
replied
shortly
and
with
a
slight
charming
affectation
of
pride
i
did
without
her
throat
tightened
and
she
could
feel
the
tears
suddenly
swim
in
her
eyes
she
was
not
touched
by
the
vision
of
his
hardships
it
was
the
thought
of
all
his
youth
that
exquisitely
saddened
her
or
all
the
years
which
were
and
would
be
for
ever
hidden
from
her
she
knew
that
she
alone
of
all
human
beings
was
gifted
with
the
power
to
understand
and
fully
sympathize
with
him
and
so
she
grieved
over
the
long
wilderness
of
time
during
which
he
had
been
uncomprehended
she
wanted
by
some
immense
effort
of
tenderness
to
recompense
him
for
all
that
he
had
suffered
and
she
had
a
divine
curiosity
concerning
the
whole
of
his
past
life
she
had
never
had
this
curiosity
in
relation
to
george
cannon
she
had
only
wondered
about
his
affairs
with
other
women
nor
had
george
cannon
ever
evoked
the
tenderness
which
sprang
up
in
her
from
some
secret
and
inexhaustible
source
at
the
mere
sight
of
edwin
clayhanger
wistful
smile
still
in
that
moment
standing
close
to
edwin
in
the
high
solitude
of
the
shadowed
attic
the
souvenir
of
george
cannon
gripped
her
painfully
she
thought
he
loves
me
and
he
is
ruined
and
he
will
never
see
me
again
and
i
am
here
bursting
with
hope
renewed
and
dizzy
with
joy
and
she
pictured
janet
too
wearying
herself
at
a
committee
meeting
and
she
thought
and
here
am
i
her
bliss
was
tragic
i
think
i
ought
to
be
going
she
said
softly
they
the
corridors
and
in
each
lower
room
as
they
passed
edwin
clayhanger
extinguished
the
gas
which
he
had
lit
there
on
the
way
up
and
hilda
waited
for
him
and
then
they
were
back
in
the
crude
glare
of
the
shop
the
fat
untidy
old
man
was
not
visible
edwin
helped
her
with
the
mackintosh
and
she
liked
him
for
the
awkwardness
of
his
efforts
in
doing
so
at
the
door
she
urged
him
not
to
come
out
and
referred
to
his
cold
this
is
the
end
of
winter
it
the
beginning
she
warned
him
nobody
else
she
knew
would
watch
over
him
but
he
insisted
on
coming
out
they
arranged
a
rendezvous
for
three
on
the
morrow
and
then
they
shook
hands
now
do
go
in
she
entreated
as
she
hurried
away
the
rain
had
ceased
she
fled
triumphantly
up
trafalgar
road
with
her
secret
guarding
it
he
in
love
with
me
if
a
scientific
truth
is
a
statement
of
which
the
contrary
is
inconceivable
then
it
was
a
scientific
truth
for
her
that
she
and
edwin
must
come
together
she
simply
would
not
and
could
not
conceive
the
future
without
him
and
this
so
soon
so
precipitately
soon
after
her
misfortune
but
it
was
her
very
misfortune
which
pushed
her
violently
forward
her
life
had
been
convulsed
and
overthrown
by
the
hazard
of
destiny
and
she
could
have
no
peace
now
until
she
had
repaired
and
it
at
no
matter
what
risk
the
thing
must
be
accomplished
quickly
quickly
chapter
iv
the
call
from
brighton
i
on
the
next
afternoon
at
a
two
hilda
and
janet
were
sitting
together
in
the
the
house
was
still
the
men
were
either
theoretically
or
practically
at
business
alicia
was
at
school
orgreave
lay
upstairs
the
servants
had
cleared
away
and
washed
up
the
and
had
dined
themselves
the
kitchen
had
been
cleansed
and
put
in
order
and
every
fire
replenished
two
of
the
servants
were
in
their
own
chambers
enfranchised
for
an
hour
one
only
remained
on
duty
all
six
women
had
the
feeling
which
comes
to
most
women
at
a
certain
moment
in
each
day
that
life
had
for
a
time
deteriorated
into
the
purposeless
and
the
futile
and
that
it
waited
as
in
a
trance
until
some
external
masculine
event
expected
or
unforeseen
should
renew
its
virtue
and
its
energy
hilda
was
in
half
a
mind
to
tell
janet
the
history
of
the
past
year
she
had
wakened
up
in
the
night
and
perceived
with
dreadful
clearness
that
trouble
lay
in
front
of
her
the
relations
between
herself
and
edwin
clayhanger
were
developing
with
the
most
dizzy
rapidity
and
in
a
direction
which
she
desired
but
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
if
she
fostered
the
relations
to
continue
to
keep
edwin
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
having
been
known
for
about
a
fortnight
as
george
cannon
she
was
not
what
he
supposed
her
to
be
with
imagination
on
fire
she
was
anticipating
the
rendezvous
at
three
she
reached
forward
to
it
in
ecstasy
but
she
might
not
enjoy
it
save
at
the
price
which
her
conscience
exacted
she
had
to
say
to
edwin
clayhanger
that
she
had
been
the
victim
of
a
bigamist
could
she
say
it
to
him
she
had
not
been
able
to
say
it
even
to
janet
orgreave
she
would
say
it
first
to
janet
there
in
the
she
would
say
it
if
it
killed
her
to
say
it
she
would
say
it
she
must
at
any
cost
be
able
to
respect
herself
and
as
matters
stood
she
could
not
respect
herself
janet
on
her
knees
was
idly
arranging
books
on
one
of
the
lower
bookshelves
in
sheer
nervousness
hilda
also
dropped
to
her
knees
on
the
hearthrug
and
began
to
worry
the
fire
with
the
poker
i
say
janet
she
began
yes
janet
did
not
look
up
hilda
her
heart
beating
thought
with
affrighted
swiftness
why
should
i
tell
her
it
is
no
business
of
anybody
except
i
will
tell
him
and
him
alone
and
then
act
according
to
his
wishes
after
all
i
am
not
to
blame
i
am
quite
innocent
but
i
wo
tell
him
not
i
must
be
more
sure
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
tell
him
if
i
told
him
it
would
be
almost
like
inviting
a
proposal
but
when
the
proper
time
comes
then
i
will
tell
him
and
he
will
understand
he
is
bound
to
understand
perfectly
he
in
love
with
me
she
dared
not
tell
janet
in
that
abode
of
joyful
and
successful
propriety
the
words
would
not
form
themselves
and
the
argument
that
she
was
not
to
blame
carried
no
weight
whatever
she
she
hilda
lacked
courage
to
be
candid
this
was
extremely
disconcerting
to
her
and
even
with
edwin
clayhanger
she
wished
to
temporize
she
longed
for
nothing
so
much
as
to
see
him
and
yet
she
feared
to
meet
him
yes
janet
repeated
a
bell
rang
faintly
in
the
distance
of
the
house
hilda
suddenly
choosing
a
course
said
i
forgot
to
tell
you
supposed
to
be
going
down
to
clayhanger
at
three
to
see
a
machine
at
work
it
was
too
late
last
night
do
come
with
me
i
hate
going
by
myself
it
was
true
in
that
instant
she
did
hate
going
by
herself
she
thought
knowing
janet
to
be
at
liberty
and
never
dreaming
that
she
would
refuse
i
am
saved
for
the
present
but
janet
answered
i
do
think
i
must
leave
mother
you
be
perfectly
all
right
by
yourself
hilda
impetuously
turned
her
head
their
glances
met
for
an
instant
in
suspicion
challenge
animosity
they
had
an
immense
mutual
admiration
the
one
for
the
other
these
two
and
yet
now
they
were
estranged
esteem
was
nullified
by
instinct
hilda
thought
with
positive
savagery
it
all
fiddlesticks
about
not
leaving
her
mother
she
simply
on
her
high
horse
the
whole
colour
of
existence
was
changed
ii
martha
entered
the
room
neither
of
the
girls
moved
beneath
the
deferential
servant
in
martha
was
a
human
girl
making
a
third
in
the
room
who
familiarly
divined
the
moods
of
the
other
two
and
judged
them
as
an
equal
and
the
other
two
knew
it
and
therefore
did
not
trouble
to
be
spectacular
in
front
of
her
a
letter
miss
said
martha
approaching
hilda
the
old
postman
says
it
was
insufficiently
addressed
or
it
ha
been
here
by
first
post
was
that
the
postman
who
rang
just
now
asked
janet
yes
miss
hilda
took
the
letter
with
apprehension
as
she
recognized
the
calligraphy
of
sarah
gailey
yes
the
address
was
imperfect
miss
lessways
osmond
orgreave
lane
end
house
instead
of
bursley
on
the
back
of
the
envelope
had
been
written
in
pencil
by
an
official
try
bursley
sarah
gailey
could
not
now
be
trusted
to
address
an
envelope
correctly
the
mere
handwriting
seemed
to
announce
misfortune
from
poor
sarah
hilda
murmured
with
false
tranquillity
i
wonder
what
sort
of
trouble
she
thinks
she
got
into
she
thought
if
only
i
was
married
i
should
be
free
of
responsibility
about
sarah
i
should
have
to
think
of
my
husband
first
but
nothing
else
can
free
me
unless
i
marry
i
tied
to
sarah
gailey
as
long
as
she
lives
and
why
i
should
like
to
know
the
answer
was
simple
habit
had
shackled
her
to
sarah
gailey
she
opened
the
letter
by
the
flickering
firelight
which
was
stronger
on
the
hearthrug
than
the
light
of
the
dim
november
day
it
began
dearest
hilda
i
write
at
once
to
tell
you
that
a
lawyer
called
here
this
afternoon
to
inquire
about
your
hotel
continental
shares
he
told
me
there
was
going
to
be
some
difficulty
with
the
company
and
unless
the
independent
shareholders
formed
a
strong
local
committee
to
look
after
things
the
trouble
might
be
serious
he
wanted
to
know
if
you
would
support
a
committee
at
the
meeting
i
gave
him
your
address
and
going
to
write
to
you
but
i
thought
i
would
write
to
you
as
well
his
name
is
eustace
broughton
east
street
in
case
i
do
hope
nothing
will
go
wrong
it
is
like
what
must
be
i
am
sure
it
has
been
impossible
for
me
to
keep
the
charwoman
so
i
sent
her
off
this
morning
can
you
remember
the
address
of
that
mrs
catkin
sarah
gailey
continued
to
discuss
affairs
until
she
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
page
and
then
in
a
few
cramped
words
she
finished
with
expressions
of
love
oh
dear
hilda
exclaimed
rising
i
must
write
some
letters
at
once
she
sighed
as
if
in
tedium
the
fact
that
her
fortune
was
vaguely
threatened
did
not
cause
her
anxiety
she
scarcely
realized
it
what
she
saw
was
an
opportunity
to
evade
the
immediate
meeting
with
edwin
the
meeting
which
a
few
minutes
earlier
she
had
desired
beyond
everything
when
now
hilda
nodded
but
what
about
master
edwin
janet
asked
trying
to
be
gay
i
sha
be
able
to
go
said
hilda
carelessly
at
the
door
it
of
no
consequence
martha
has
to
go
down
town
if
you
like
she
could
call
in
there
and
just
tell
him
it
was
a
reproof
from
the
young
woman
who
always
so
thoughtfully
studied
the
feelings
of
everybody
i
just
write
a
little
note
then
thanks
hilda
returned
calmly
triumphing
after
all
over
janet
superiority
and
thinking
janet
can
be
very
peculiar
janet
can
iii
for
more
than
twenty
hours
hilda
was
profoundly
miserable
towards
the
evening
of
the
same
day
she
had
made
herself
quite
sure
that
edwin
clayhanger
would
call
that
night
her
hope
persisted
until
nine
it
then
began
to
fade
and
at
ten
was
extinct
his
name
had
been
mentioned
by
nobody
she
went
to
bed
having
now
a
room
of
her
own
which
overlooked
the
clayhanger
garden
and
house
she
gazed
forth
and
in
the
dark
beheld
with
the
most
anxious
sensations
the
building
in
which
edwin
existed
and
was
concealed
he
is
there
she
said
he
is
active
about
something
at
this
very
instant
perhaps
he
is
reading
he
is
close
by
if
i
shouted
he
might
hear
and
yet
she
was
utterly
cut
off
from
him
again
in
the
late
dawn
she
saw
the
same
building
pale
and
clear
but
just
as
secretive
and
enigmatic
as
in
the
night
he
is
asleep
yet
she
thought
why
did
he
not
call
is
he
hurt
is
he
proud
she
despaired
because
she
could
devise
no
means
of
resuming
communication
with
him
immediately
after
dinner
on
the
next
day
she
went
with
janet
to
room
to
examine
a
new
winter
cloak
which
had
been
delivered
and
while
janet
was
trying
it
on
and
posing
coquettishly
and
yet
without
affectation
in
front
of
the
glass
and
while
hilda
was
reflecting
jealously
why
am
i
not
like
her
i
know
infinitely
more
than
she
knows
i
am
a
woman
and
she
is
a
girl
and
yet
she
seems
far
more
a
woman
than
i
alicia
contrary
to
all
rules
took
the
room
by
storm
alicia
excuse
and
salvation
lay
in
a
telegram
which
she
held
in
her
hand
for
you
hilda
cried
the
child
excited
i
just
off
to
school
hilda
reached
to
take
the
offered
telegram
but
her
hand
wavered
around
it
instead
of
seizing
it
her
eye
fastened
on
a
circular
portion
of
the
pattern
and
she
felt
that
the
whole
room
was
revolving
about
her
then
she
saw
janet
face
transformed
by
an
expression
of
alarm
are
you
ill
hilda
janet
demanded
sit
down
you
frightfully
pale
said
alicia
eagerly
hilda
sat
down
no
no
she
said
it
was
the
pattern
of
the
that
made
me
feel
dizzy
and
for
the
moment
she
did
honestly
believe
that
the
pattern
of
the
had
in
some
inexplicable
manner
upset
her
i
all
right
now
the
dizziness
passed
as
suddenly
as
it
had
supervened
janet
held
some
ineffectual
salts
to
her
nose
i
perfectly
well
insisted
hilda
how
funny
alicia
grinned
calmly
hilda
opened
the
telegram
which
read
please
come
at
gailey
she
gave
the
telegram
to
janet
in
silence
what
can
be
the
matter
janet
asked
with
unreserved
loving
solicitude
the
cloud
which
had
hung
between
the
two
enthusiastic
friends
was
dissipated
in
a
flash
i
have
an
idea
said
hilda
touched
unless
it
those
shares
she
had
briefly
told
janet
about
the
hotel
continental
limited
shall
you
go
hilda
nodded
never
again
would
she
ignore
an
urgent
telegram
though
she
did
not
believe
that
this
telegram
had
any
real
importance
she
attributed
it
to
sarah
increasing
incompetence
and
hysterical
foolishness
i
wonder
whether
i
can
get
on
to
brighton
if
i
take
the
six
train
hilda
asked
and
to
herself
can
it
have
anything
to
do
with
george
alicia
endowed
with
authority
went
in
search
of
a
bradshaw
but
the
quest
was
fruitless
in
the
five
towns
the
local
showing
the
connections
with
london
suffices
for
the
citizen
and
the
of
no
citizen
is
complete
without
it
clayhangers
are
bound
to
have
a
bradshaw
cried
alicia
breathless
with
running
about
the
house
of
course
they
are
janet
agreed
i
walk
down
there
now
said
hilda
with
extraordinary
promptitude
it
wo
take
five
minutes
i
go
said
alicia
only
i
should
be
late
for
school
shall
i
send
some
one
down
janet
suggested
you
might
be
taken
dizzy
again
no
thanks
hilda
replied
deliberately
i
go
myself
nothing
wrong
with
me
at
all
you
have
to
be
sharp
over
it
said
alicia
pertly
do
forget
it
thursday
they
shut
up
at
two
and
it
not
far
off
two
now
i
going
this
very
minute
said
hilda
and
i
going
this
very
second
alicia
retorted
they
all
three
left
janet
bedroom
the
new
cloak
cast
over
a
back
was
degraded
into
a
tedious
banality
and
ignored
in
less
than
a
minute
hilda
hatted
and
jacketed
and
partially
gloved
was
crossing
the
garden
she
felt
most
miraculously
happy
and
hopeful
and
she
was
full
of
irrational
gratitude
to
alicia
as
though
alicia
were
a
benefactor
the
change
in
her
mood
seemed
magic
in
its
swiftness
if
janet
with
calm
cryptic
face
had
not
been
watching
her
from
the
doorway
she
might
have
danced
on
the
gravel
chapter
v
thursday
afternoon
i
she
was
walking
with
edwin
clayhanger
up
duck
bank
on
the
way
to
bursley
railway
station
a
simple
errand
and
promenade
and
yet
she
felt
herself
to
be
steeped
in
the
romance
of
an
adventure
the
adventure
had
surprisingly
followed
upon
the
discovery
that
alicia
had
been
quite
wrong
clayhangers
are
bound
to
have
a
bradshaw
the
confident
alicia
had
said
but
clayhangers
happened
not
to
have
a
bradshaw
edwin
was
alone
in
the
stationery
shop
save
for
the
assistant
he
said
that
his
father
was
indisposed
and
whereas
the
news
that
clayhangers
had
no
bradshaw
left
hilda
perfectly
indifferent
the
news
that
old
darius
clayhanger
was
indisposed
and
absent
produced
in
her
a
definite
feeling
of
gladness
edwin
had
decided
that
the
most
likely
place
to
search
for
a
bradshaw
was
the
station
and
he
had
offered
to
escort
her
to
the
station
nothing
could
have
been
more
natural
and
at
the
same
time
more
miraculous
the
sun
was
palely
shining
upon
dry
clean
pavements
and
upon
roads
juicy
with
black
mud
and
in
the
sunshine
hilda
was
very
happy
it
was
nothing
to
her
that
she
was
in
quest
of
a
bradshaw
because
she
had
just
received
an
ominous
telegram
urgently
summoning
her
to
brighton
she
was
obliviously
happy
every
phenomenon
that
attracted
her
notice
contributed
to
her
felicity
thus
she
took
an
eager
joy
in
the
sun
and
a
marked
improvement
in
edwin
cold
really
delighted
her
she
was
dominated
by
the
intimate
conviction
he
loves
me
which
conviction
excited
her
dormant
pride
and
made
her
straighten
her
shoulders
she
benevolently
condescended
towards
janet
after
all
janet
with
every
circumstance
in
her
favour
had
not
known
how
to
conquer
edwin
clayhanger
after
all
she
hilda
possessed
some
mysterious
characteristic
more
potent
than
the
elegance
and
the
goodness
of
janet
orgreave
she
scorned
her
former
and
reproached
her
own
lack
of
faith
i
am
i
that
was
the
summary
of
her
mood
as
for
her
attitude
to
edwin
clayhanger
she
could
not
explain
it
why
did
she
like
him
and
like
being
with
him
he
was
not
brilliant
nor
masterful
nor
handsome
nor
well
dressed
nor
in
any
manner
imposing
on
the
contrary
he
was
awkward
and
apologetic
and
not
a
bit
spectacular
only
the
wistful
gaze
of
his
eyes
and
his
honest
smile
and
the
appeal
of
his
gestures
a
puzzling
affair
an
affair
perfectly
incomprehensible
and
enchanting
they
walked
side
by
side
in
silence
when
they
had
turned
into
moorthorne
road
up
whose
slope
lies
the
station
she
asked
a
question
about
a
large
wooden
building
from
whose
interior
came
wild
sounds
of
shouting
and
cheering
and
learnt
that
the
potters
on
strike
were
holding
a
meeting
in
the
town
theatre
at
the
open
outer
doors
was
a
crowd
of
starving
shivering
dirty
ragged
children
who
romped
and
cursed
or
stood
unnaturally
meditative
in
the
rich
mud
like
fakirs
fulfilling
a
vow
hilda
throat
was
constricted
by
the
sight
pain
and
joy
ran
together
in
her
burning
exquisitely
and
she
had
a
glimpse
obscure
of
the
mystical
beauty
of
the
children
suffering
i
no
idea
there
was
a
theatre
in
bursley
she
remarked
idly
driven
into
a
banality
by
the
press
of
her
sensations
they
used
to
call
it
the
blood
tub
he
replied
melodrama
and
murder
and
gore
you
know
she
exclaimed
in
horror
why
are
people
like
that
in
the
five
towns
it
our
form
of
poetry
i
suppose
said
he
she
started
sensitively
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
never
understood
the
secret
inner
spirit
of
the
five
towns
and
that
by
a
single
phrase
he
had
made
her
understand
it
form
of
poetry
who
but
he
could
have
said
a
thing
at
once
so
illuminating
and
so
simple
apparently
perplexed
by
the
obvious
effect
on
her
of
his
remark
he
said
but
you
belong
to
the
five
towns
do
you
she
answered
quietly
that
she
did
but
her
heart
was
saying
i
do
you
have
initiated
me
i
never
felt
the
five
towns
before
you
have
made
me
feel
them
ii
at
the
station
the
head
porter
received
their
inquiry
for
a
bradshaw
with
a
dull
stare
and
a
shake
of
the
head
no
such
thing
had
ever
been
asked
for
at
bursley
station
before
and
the
man
imagination
could
not
go
beyond
the
soiled
loosely
pinned
and
pasted
up
on
the
walls
of
the
hilda
suggested
that
the
should
be
interrogated
but
the
aperture
of
communication
with
him
was
shut
she
saw
edwin
clayhanger
brace
himself
and
rap
on
the
wood
and
instead
of
deploring
his
diffidence
she
liked
it
and
found
it
full
of
charm
the
partition
clicked
aside
and
the
peering
suspicious
head
showed
in
its
place
mutely
demanding
a
reason
for
this
extraordinary
disturbance
of
the
dream
in
which
the
station
slumbered
between
two
trains
with
a
characteristic
peculiar
slanting
motion
edwin
nodded
oh
d
mr
brooks
said
edwin
hastily
as
if
startled
by
the
sudden
inexplicable
apparition
of
the
head
but
the
had
no
bradshaw
either
he
considered
it
probable
however
that
the
stationmaster
would
have
a
bradshaw
edwin
had
to
brace
himself
again
for
an
assault
upon
the
fastness
of
the
stationmaster
and
in
the
incredibly
small
and
incredibly
dirty
fastness
of
the
stationmaster
they
indeed
found
a
bradshaw
hilda
precipitately
took
it
and
opened
it
on
the
stationmaster
table
she
looked
for
brighton
in
it
as
she
might
have
looked
for
a
particular
individual
in
a
city
then
edwin
was
bending
over
it
with
his
ear
close
to
her
ear
and
the
sleeve
of
his
overcoat
touching
her
sleeve
she
was
physically
aware
of
him
for
the
first
time
she
thought
disconcerted
but
he
is
an
utter
stranger
to
me
what
do
i
know
of
him
and
then
she
thought
for
more
than
a
year
he
must
have
carried
my
image
in
his
heart
here
said
edwin
brusquely
and
with
a
certain
superiority
you
might
just
let
me
have
a
look
at
it
myself
she
yielded
tacitly
admitting
that
a
woman
was
no
match
for
bradshaw
after
a
few
moments
frowning
edwin
said
yes
there
a
train
to
brighton
at
may
i
look
certainly
said
he
subtly
condescending
she
examined
the
page
with
a
serious
deliberation
but
what
does
this
mean
she
asked
did
you
notice
this
yes
it
means
thursdays
and
saturdays
only
said
edwin
his
eyes
twinkling
it
was
as
if
he
had
said
you
think
yourself
very
clever
but
do
you
suppose
that
i
ca
read
the
notes
in
a
well
she
hesitated
thursday
you
see
he
remarked
curtly
she
was
ravished
by
his
tone
and
his
manner
and
she
became
humble
before
him
for
in
the
space
of
a
few
seconds
he
had
grown
mysteriously
and
powerfully
masculine
to
her
but
with
all
his
masculinity
there
remained
the
same
wistful
honest
boyish
look
in
his
eyes
and
she
thought
if
i
marry
him
it
will
be
for
the
look
in
his
eyes
i
all
right
then
she
said
aloud
and
smiled
with
hands
nervously
working
within
her
muff
she
suddenly
missed
the
handkerchief
which
she
had
placed
there
i
believe
i
must
have
dropped
my
handkerchief
in
your
shop
she
was
about
to
say
the
phrase
was
actually
on
her
tongue
but
by
a
strange
instinctive
defensive
discretion
she
shut
her
mouth
on
it
and
kept
silence
she
thought
perhaps
i
had
better
not
go
into
his
shop
again
iii
they
descended
the
hill
from
the
station
hilda
was
very
ill
at
ease
she
kept
saying
to
herself
this
adventure
is
over
now
i
can
not
prolong
it
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
back
to
the
orgreaves
and
pack
my
things
and
depart
to
brighton
and
face
whatever
annoyance
is
awaiting
me
at
brighton
the
prospect
desolated
her
she
could
not
bear
to
leave
edwin
clayhanger
without
some
definition
of
their
relations
and
yet
she
knew
that
it
was
hopeless
and
absurd
to
expect
to
arrive
immediately
at
any
such
definition
she
knew
that
the
impetuosity
of
her
temperament
could
not
be
justified
also
she
feared
horribly
the
risk
of
being
caught
again
in
the
net
of
brighton
as
they
got
lower
and
lower
down
the
hill
her
wretchedness
and
disquiet
became
acute
to
the
point
of
a
wild
despair
merely
to
temporize
she
said
as
they
drew
opposite
the
wooden
theatre
could
we
just
go
and
look
in
i
got
plenty
of
time
a
strange
request
to
penetrate
into
a
meeting
of
artisans
on
strike
she
felt
its
strangeness
she
felt
that
edwin
clayhanger
objected
but
she
was
driven
to
an
extremity
she
had
to
do
something
and
she
did
what
she
could
they
crossed
the
road
and
entered
the
huge
shanty
and
stood
apologetically
near
the
door
the
contrast
between
the
open
street
and
the
enclosed
stuffiness
of
the
dim
and
crowded
interior
was
overwhelming
hundreds
of
ragged
and
shabby
men
sat
in
serried
rows
leaning
forward
with
elbows
out
and
heads
protruding
as
they
listened
to
a
speech
from
the
gimcrack
stage
they
seemed
to
be
waiting
to
spring
like
famished
and
ferocious
tigers
interrupting
they
growled
snarled
yapped
and
swore
with
appalling
sincerity
imprecations
burst
forth
in
volleys
and
in
running
fires
the
arousing
of
the
fundamental
instincts
of
these
human
beings
had
indeed
enormously
emphasized
the
animal
in
them
they
had
swung
back
a
hundred
centuries
towards
original
crude
life
the
sophistication
which
embroiders
the
had
been
stripped
clean
off
these
men
helped
you
to
understand
the
state
of
mind
which
puts
a
city
to
the
sack
and
makes
victims
especially
of
the
innocent
and
the
defenceless
hilda
was
strangely
excited
she
was
afraid
and
enjoyed
being
afraid
and
it
was
as
if
she
too
had
been
returned
to
savagery
and
to
the
primeval
in
the
midst
of
peril
she
was
a
female
under
the
protection
of
a
male
and
nothing
but
that
and
she
was
far
closer
emotionally
to
her
male
than
she
had
ever
been
before
suddenly
the
meeting
came
to
an
end
in
an
instant
the
mass
of
humanity
was
afoot
and
rounding
upon
them
an
active
menace
hilda
and
edwin
rushed
fleeing
into
the
street
violently
urged
by
a
common
impulse
the
stream
of
embittered
men
pursued
them
like
an
inundation
when
they
were
safe
and
breathing
the
free
air
hilda
was
drenched
with
a
sense
of
pity
the
tragedy
of
existence
presented
itself
in
its
true
aspect
as
noble
and
majestic
and
intimidating
it
terrible
she
breathed
she
thought
no
in
this
mood
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
leave
him
i
can
not
do
it
i
can
not
the
danger
of
the
shop
which
would
be
closed
now
utterly
fascinated
her
supposing
that
she
the
shop
with
him
would
she
have
the
courage
to
tell
him
that
she
was
in
his
society
under
false
pretences
could
she
bring
herself
to
relate
her
misfortune
she
recoiled
before
the
mere
idea
of
telling
him
and
yet
the
danger
of
the
shop
glittered
in
front
of
her
like
a
lure
the
future
might
be
depending
solely
on
her
own
act
if
she
told
him
of
the
lost
handkerchief
the
future
might
be
one
thing
if
she
did
not
tell
him
it
might
be
another
the
dread
of
choosing
seized
her
and
put
her
into
a
tremble
of
apprehension
and
then
as
it
were
mechanically
she
murmured
but
very
clearly
tacking
the
words
without
a
pause
on
to
a
sentence
about
the
strikes
oh
i
lost
my
handkerchief
unless
i
left
it
in
your
shop
it
must
have
dropped
out
of
my
muff
she
sighed
in
relief
because
she
had
chosen
but
her
agitation
was
intensified
iv
in
search
of
a
lost
handkerchief
they
regained
the
clayhanger
premises
by
an
unfamiliar
side
door
she
preceded
him
along
a
passage
and
then
taking
a
door
on
the
left
found
herself
surprisingly
in
the
shop
behind
a
counter
the
shop
was
lighted
only
by
a
few
holes
in
the
central
shutters
and
it
had
a
troubling
aspect
of
portent
with
its
merchandise
mysteriously
enveloped
in
pale
sheets
and
its
chairs
wrong
side
up
and
its
corners
destiny
might
have
been
lurking
in
one
of
those
baffling
corners
from
above
through
the
ceiling
came
the
vibration
of
some
machine
at
work
and
the
machine
might
have
been
the
loom
of
time
hilda
was
exquisitely
apprehensive
she
thought
i
am
here
the
moment
of
my
departure
will
come
when
it
comes
shall
i
have
told
him
my
misfortune
what
will
have
happened
she
waited
nervous
restless
shaking
like
a
victim
who
can
do
naught
but
wait
here
my
handkerchief
she
cried
in
a
tone
of
unnatural
childish
glee
that
was
one
of
the
effects
of
her
secret
panic
the
handkerchief
glimmered
on
the
counter
more
white
than
anything
else
in
that
grey
dusk
she
guessed
that
the
must
have
found
it
and
placed
it
conspicuously
on
the
counter
they
were
alone
they
were
their
own
prisoners
secure
from
the
street
and
from
all
interruption
hilda
once
more
and
in
a
higher
degree
realized
the
miraculous
human
power
to
make
experience
out
of
nothing
they
had
nothing
but
themselves
and
they
could
if
they
chose
create
all
their
future
by
a
single
gesture
suddenly
there
came
a
tremendous
shouting
from
duck
square
in
front
of
the
shop
the
strikers
had
poured
down
from
moorthorne
road
into
duck
bank
and
duck
square
edwin
who
was
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
went
to
the
glazed
inner
doors
and
passing
through
into
the
porch
lifted
the
in
a
shutter
and
stooping
looked
forth
he
called
to
her
without
moving
his
face
from
the
aperture
that
a
fight
was
in
progress
hilda
gazed
at
his
back
through
the
glass
and
then
coming
round
the
end
of
the
counter
approached
quietly
and
stood
immediately
behind
him
between
the
glazed
doors
and
the
shutters
the
two
were
in
a
space
so
small
that
they
could
scarcely
have
moved
without
touching
let
me
look
she
stammered
unable
any
longer
to
tolerate
the
inaction
edwin
clayhanger
stepped
aside
and
held
up
the
for
her
with
his
finger
she
bent
her
head
to
the
oblong
glimpse
of
the
street
and
saw
the
strikers
engaged
in
the
final
internecine
folly
of
strikers
they
had
turned
their
exasperated
wrath
upon
each
other
within
a
at
the
top
of
the
little
square
other
strikers
were
drinking
one
policeman
regarded
them
what
a
shame
she
cried
angrily
dropping
the
flap
and
then
withdrew
quickly
into
the
shop
whither
edwin
had
gone
as
she
came
near
him
her
mood
changed
she
smiled
gently
she
summoned
all
her
charm
and
she
knew
that
she
charmed
him
do
you
know
she
said
you
quite
altered
my
notion
of
poetry
what
you
said
as
we
were
going
up
to
the
station
really
he
flushed
yes
she
had
enchanted
and
entranced
him
she
had
only
to
smile
and
to
use
a
particular
tone
soft
and
breaking
she
knew
that
but
you
alter
my
notions
she
continued
and
her
clear
voice
was
poured
out
like
a
liquid
i
do
know
how
it
is
she
stopped
and
then
in
accents
so
this
is
your
little
office
her
hand
was
on
the
knob
of
the
open
door
of
the
cubicle
a
black
erection
within
the
shop
where
edwin
and
his
father
kept
the
accounts
and
wrote
letters
yes
go
in
and
have
a
look
at
it
she
murmured
kindly
shall
i
and
went
in
he
followed
for
a
moment
she
was
extremely
afraid
and
she
whispered
scared
i
must
hurry
off
now
he
ignored
this
remark
shall
you
be
at
brighton
long
he
demanded
and
he
was
so
friendly
and
simple
and
timorous
and
and
his
features
had
such
an
extraordinary
anxious
expression
that
her
own
fear
seemed
to
leave
her
she
thought
as
if
surprised
by
the
discovery
he
is
a
good
friend
oh
i
ca
tell
she
answered
him
it
depends
how
soon
shall
you
be
down
our
way
again
his
voice
was
thickening
she
shook
her
head
speechless
she
was
afraid
again
now
his
face
altered
he
was
standing
almost
over
her
she
thought
i
am
lost
i
have
let
it
come
to
this
he
was
no
longer
a
good
friend
he
began
to
speak
in
detached
bits
of
phrases
i
say
you
know
she
murmured
anxiously
i
must
go
thanks
very
much
and
foolishly
she
held
out
her
hand
which
he
seized
he
bent
passionately
and
kissed
her
like
a
fresh
boy
like
a
schoolboy
and
she
gave
back
the
kiss
strongly
with
all
the
profound
sincerity
of
her
nature
his
agitation
appeared
to
be
extreme
but
she
was
calm
she
was
divinely
calm
she
savoured
the
moment
as
though
she
had
been
a
watcher
and
not
an
actor
in
the
scene
she
thought
with
a
secret
sigh
of
bliss
yes
it
is
real
this
moment
and
i
have
had
it
am
i
astonished
that
it
has
come
so
soon
or
did
i
know
it
was
coming
her
eyes
drank
up
the
face
and
the
hands
and
the
gestures
of
her
lover
she
felt
tired
and
sat
down
in
the
office
chair
and
he
leaned
on
the
desk
and
the
walls
of
the
cubicle
folded
them
in
even
from
the
inanimate
scrutiny
of
the
shop
v
they
were
talking
together
and
yet
with
the
confidence
of
deep
mutual
trust
in
the
darkness
of
the
cubicle
and
while
they
were
talking
hilda
in
her
head
was
writing
a
fervent
letter
to
him
you
see
it
was
so
sudden
i
had
had
no
chance
to
tell
you
i
did
so
want
to
tell
you
but
how
could
i
and
i
had
told
anybody
i
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
that
it
is
best
to
tell
some
things
as
little
as
possible
and
when
you
had
kissed
me
how
could
i
tell
you
then
at
once
i
could
not
it
would
have
spoilt
everything
surely
you
understand
i
know
you
do
because
you
understand
everything
if
i
was
wrong
tell
me
where
you
do
guess
how
humble
i
am
when
i
think
of
you
i
am
the
humblest
girl
you
can
imagine
forgive
me
if
there
is
anything
to
forgive
i
do
need
to
tell
you
that
i
have
suffered
and
she
kept
writing
the
letter
again
and
again
slightly
altering
the
phrases
so
as
to
improve
them
so
as
to
express
herself
better
and
more
honestly
and
more
appealingly
i
shall
send
you
the
address
she
was
saying
to
him
i
shall
write
you
before
i
go
to
bed
whether
it
or
morning
she
put
the
fire
of
her
love
into
the
assurance
she
smiled
to
entrance
him
and
saw
on
his
face
that
he
was
beside
himself
with
joy
in
her
she
was
a
queen
surpassing
in
her
prerogative
a
thousand
elegant
janets
she
smiled
she
proudly
straightened
her
shoulders
she
the
humblest
and
her
boy
was
enslaved
i
wonder
what
people
will
say
he
murmured
she
said
with
a
pang
of
misgiving
about
his
reception
of
her
letter
please
tell
no
one
she
pleaded
that
for
the
present
he
should
tell
no
one
later
on
it
wo
seem
so
sudden
she
added
plausibly
people
are
so
silly
the
sound
of
another
battle
in
duck
square
awoke
them
the
shop
was
very
chilly
and
quite
dark
their
faces
were
only
pale
ovals
in
the
blackness
she
shivered
i
must
go
i
have
to
pack
he
clasped
her
and
she
was
innocently
content
she
was
a
young
girl
again
i
walk
up
with
you
he
said
protectively
but
she
would
not
allow
him
to
walk
up
with
her
and
he
yielded
he
struck
a
match
they
stumbled
out
and
in
the
midnight
of
the
passage
he
took
leave
of
her
walking
up
trafalgar
road
alone
she
was
so
happy
so
amazed
so
relieved
so
sure
of
him
and
of
his
fineness
and
of
the
future
that
she
could
scarcely
bear
her
felicity
it
was
too
intense
at
last
her
life
was
settled
and
mapped
out
destiny
had
been
kind
and
she
meant
to
be
worthy
of
her
fate
she
could
have
swooned
so
intoxicant
was
her
wonder
and
her
solemn
joy
and
her
yearning
after
righteousness
in
love
chapter
vi
mischance
i
twelve
days
later
in
the
evening
hilda
stood
by
the
bedside
of
sarah
gailey
in
the
basement
room
of
no
preston
street
there
was
a
bright
fire
in
the
grate
and
in
front
of
the
fire
a
doctor
was
cleansing
the
instrument
which
he
had
just
employed
to
inject
morphia
into
sarah
exhausted
body
hilda
assumption
that
the
ageing
woman
had
telegraphed
for
her
on
inadequate
grounds
had
proved
to
be
quite
wrong
upon
entering
the
house
on
that
thursday
night
hilda
despite
the
anxious
pale
face
of
the
new
servant
who
had
waited
up
for
her
and
who
entreated
her
to
see
sarah
gailey
instantly
had
gone
first
to
her
own
room
and
scrawled
passionately
a
note
to
edwin
which
ran
dearest
this
is
my
address
i
love
you
every
bit
of
me
is
absolutely
yours
write
h
she
gave
the
letter
to
the
servant
to
post
at
once
and
as
she
gave
it
she
had
a
vision
of
it
travelling
in
post
office
railway
vans
and
being
sorted
and
sealed
up
in
a
bag
and
recovered
from
the
bag
and
scanned
by
the
postman
at
bursley
and
borne
up
trafalgar
road
by
the
postman
and
dropped
into
the
at
edwin
house
and
finally
seized
by
edwin
and
of
it
pleasing
him
intensely
for
it
was
a
good
letter
and
she
was
proud
of
it
because
she
knew
that
it
was
characteristic
and
then
with
her
mind
freed
she
had
opened
the
door
of
bedroom
sarah
was
unquestionably
very
sarah
had
been
quite
right
in
telegraphing
so
peremptorily
to
hilda
and
if
she
had
not
so
telegraphed
she
would
have
been
quite
wrong
on
the
previous
day
she
had
been
sitting
on
the
cold
new
oilcloth
of
the
topmost
stairs
minutely
instructing
a
maid
in
the
craft
of
polishing
banisters
and
the
next
morning
an
attack
of
acute
sciatica
had
supervened
for
a
trifling
indiscretion
sarah
was
thus
condemned
to
extreme
physical
torture
hilda
had
found
her
rigid
on
the
bed
she
suffered
the
severest
pain
in
the
small
of
the
back
and
all
down
the
left
leg
her
left
knee
was
supported
on
pillows
and
the
were
raised
away
from
it
for
it
could
tolerate
no
weight
whatever
the
doctor
who
had
been
and
gone
had
arranged
a
system
of
fomentation
and
bottles
surpassing
anything
in
even
sarah
experience
and
there
sarah
lay
not
feverish
but
sweating
with
agony
terrified
to
move
terrified
to
take
a
deep
breath
lest
the
disturbance
of
the
muscles
might
produce
consequences
beyond
her
strength
to
endure
she
was
in
no
danger
of
death
she
could
talk
she
could
eat
and
drink
her
pulse
was
scarcely
quickened
but
she
was
degraded
and
humiliated
by
mere
physical
anguish
to
the
condition
of
a
brute
this
was
her
lot
in
life
all
through
that
first
night
hilda
stayed
with
her
trying
to
pretend
that
sarah
was
a
woman
and
in
the
morning
she
had
assumed
control
of
the
house
she
had
her
secret
to
console
her
it
remained
a
secret
because
there
was
no
one
to
whom
she
could
relate
it
sarah
had
no
ear
for
news
unconnected
with
her
malady
and
indeed
to
tell
sarah
as
sarah
was
would
have
been
to
carry
callousness
to
the
point
of
insult
and
so
hilda
amid
her
enormous
labours
and
fatigue
had
lived
with
her
secret
which
from
being
a
perfumed
delight
turned
in
two
days
to
something
subtly
horrible
to
something
that
by
its
horror
prevented
her
from
writing
to
edwin
aught
but
the
briefest
missives
she
had
existed
from
hour
to
hour
from
one
minute
apprehensively
to
the
next
day
and
night
hardly
sleeping
devoured
inwardly
by
a
fear
at
once
monstrous
and
simple
at
once
convincing
and
incredible
as
for
the
letter
which
mentally
she
had
composed
a
hundred
times
to
edwin
and
which
she
owed
to
him
it
had
become
fantastic
and
then
inconceivable
to
her
ii
one
of
the
new
servants
entered
the
room
and
handed
a
letter
to
hilda
and
left
the
room
and
shut
the
door
the
envelope
was
addressed
miss
lessways
preston
street
brighton
in
edwin
clayhanger
beautiful
handwriting
every
evening
came
thus
a
letter
which
he
had
posted
in
bursley
on
the
previous
day
hilda
thought
will
this
contain
another
reproach
at
my
irregularity
i
ca
bear
it
if
it
does
and
she
gazed
at
the
handwriting
and
in
particular
at
her
own
name
and
her
own
name
seemed
to
be
the
name
of
somebody
else
of
some
strange
young
woman
she
felt
dizzy
the
door
of
sarah
wardrobe
was
ajar
and
in
the
mirror
of
it
hilda
could
see
herself
obscurely
a
strange
young
woman
with
untidy
hair
and
white
cheeks
and
huge
dark
staring
heavy
eyes
with
pouches
beneath
them
the
image
wavered
in
the
mirror
she
thought
here
it
is
again
this
awful
feeling
surely
i
am
not
going
to
faint
she
could
hear
sarah
sighing
breath
she
could
hear
the
singing
of
the
shaded
she
turned
her
gaze
away
from
the
mirror
and
saw
sarah
grey
head
inadvertently
nodding
as
it
always
nodded
then
the
letter
slipped
out
of
her
hand
she
glanced
down
at
the
floor
in
pursuit
of
it
the
floor
was
darkly
revolving
she
thought
am
i
really
fainting
this
time
i
must
faint
i
got
to
arrange
about
that
bacon
and
oh
lots
of
things
sarah
is
not
a
bit
better
and
i
must
sit
with
her
until
she
gets
off
to
sleep
her
legs
trembled
and
she
was
terrorized
by
extraordinary
novel
sensations
of
insecurity
oh
she
murmured
weakly
iii
you
only
fainted
said
the
doctor
in
a
low
voice
she
perceived
little
by
little
that
she
was
lying
flat
on
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
sarah
bed
and
that
he
was
kneeling
beside
her
the
bed
threw
a
shadow
on
them
both
but
she
could
see
his
benevolent
face
anxious
and
yet
reassuring
rather
clearly
what
she
whispered
in
feeble
despair
she
felt
that
her
resistance
was
definitely
broken
from
higher
up
at
the
level
of
the
hidden
bed
came
the
regular
plaintive
respiration
of
sarah
gailey
you
must
take
care
of
yourself
better
than
this
said
the
doctor
perhaps
this
is
a
day
when
you
ought
to
be
resting
she
answered
resigned
no
it
not
that
i
believe
i
going
to
have
a
child
you
must
she
stopped
oh
said
the
doctor
with
discretion
is
that
it
strange
how
the
direct
words
would
create
a
new
situation
she
had
not
told
the
doctor
that
she
had
been
through
the
ceremony
of
marriage
and
had
been
victimized
she
had
told
him
nothing
but
the
central
and
final
thought
in
her
mind
and
lo
the
new
situation
was
brought
into
being
and
the
doctor
was
accepting
it
he
was
not
emitting
astounded
her
directness
had
made
all
possible
seem
ridiculous
and
futile
and
had
made
the
expression
of
curiosity
seem
offensive
she
lay
on
the
floor
impassive
she
was
no
longer
horrified
by
expectancy
well
said
the
doctor
we
must
see
i
think
you
can
sit
up
now
you
of
an
hour
afterwards
she
went
into
sarah
room
alone
she
was
aware
of
no
emotion
whatever
she
merely
desired
as
a
professional
nurse
might
have
desired
to
see
if
sarah
slept
sarah
was
not
sleeping
she
moaned
as
she
moaned
continually
when
awake
hilda
bent
over
her
trembling
head
whose
right
side
pressed
upon
the
pillow
how
queer
thought
hilda
how
awful
that
she
did
even
hear
what
i
said
to
him
it
will
almost
kill
her
when
she
does
know
sarah
eyes
blinked
without
stirring
without
shifting
her
horizontal
preoccupied
gaze
from
the
wall
she
muttered
peevishly
what
that
you
were
saying
about
going
to
have
a
child
startled
hilda
moved
back
a
little
from
the
bed
the
doctor
says
there
no
doubt
i
am
hilda
answered
coldly
how
queer
sarah
said
i
quite
thought
but
of
course
a
girl
like
you
are
could
be
sure
i
should
like
another
biscuit
but
i
do
want
the
osbornes
the
others
she
resumed
her
moaning
iv
on
the
following
saturday
morning
rather
more
than
a
fortnight
after
her
engagement
to
edwin
clayhanger
hilda
came
out
of
the
kitchen
of
no
preston
street
and
shut
the
door
on
a
nauseating
malodorous
mess
of
broken
food
and
greasy
plates
in
the
midst
of
which
two
servants
were
noisily
gobbling
down
their
late
breakfast
and
disputing
with
a
frown
of
disgust
on
her
face
she
looked
into
sarah
bedroom
sarah
though
vaguely
better
was
still
in
constant
acute
pain
and
her
knee
still
reposed
on
a
pillow
and
was
protected
from
the
upper
and
she
still
could
not
move
hilda
put
on
a
smile
for
sarah
gailey
who
nodded
morosely
and
then
extinguishing
the
smile
as
if
it
had
been
expensive
gas
burning
to
no
purpose
she
passed
into
the
basement
and
slaked
the
fire
there
with
a
gesture
of
irresolution
she
lifted
the
lid
of
the
desk
in
the
corner
and
gazed
first
at
a
little
pile
of
four
unopened
letters
addressed
to
her
in
edwin
handwriting
and
then
at
a
volume
of
crashaw
which
the
enthusiastic
tom
orgreave
had
sent
to
her
as
a
reward
for
her
appreciation
of
crashaw
poems
she
released
the
lid
suddenly
and
went
upstairs
to
her
bedroom
chatting
sugarily
for
an
instant
on
the
way
with
the
second
miss
watchett
in
the
bedroom
she
donned
her
street
things
and
then
she
descended
she
had
to
go
to
the
registry
office
in
north
street
about
a
new
cook
she
stopped
at
the
front
door
and
then
surprisingly
went
down
once
more
into
the
basement
standing
up
at
the
desk
she
wrote
this
letter
darling
janet
i
am
now
married
to
george
cannon
the
marriage
is
not
quite
public
but
i
tell
you
before
anybody
and
you
might
tell
edwin
your
loving
least
said
soonest
mended
and
the
conciseness
would
discourage
questioning
she
inserted
the
letter
into
an
envelope
which
she
addressed
and
stamped
and
then
she
fled
with
it
from
the
house
and
in
two
minutes
it
was
in
a
and
she
was
walking
slowly
along
the
king
road
past
the
shops
the
letter
was
the
swift
and
desperate
sequel
to
several
absolutely
sterile
reflection
it
said
enough
for
the
moment
later
she
could
explain
that
her
husband
had
left
her
she
could
not
write
to
edwin
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
write
anything
to
him
she
could
not
confess
nor
beg
for
forgiveness
nor
even
for
sympathetic
understanding
she
could
not
admit
the
uninstructed
rashness
which
had
led
her
to
assume
positively
on
inadequate
grounds
that
her
union
with
george
cannon
had
been
fruitless
she
must
suffer
and
he
also
must
suffer
rather
than
let
him
know
in
any
conceivable
manner
that
all
unwitting
she
was
bearing
the
child
of
another
at
the
moment
of
her
betrothal
to
himself
she
preferred
to
be
regarded
as
a
jilt
of
the
very
worst
kind
strange
that
she
should
choose
the
rôle
of
deceiver
instead
of
the
rôle
of
victim
strange
that
she
would
sooner
be
hated
and
scorned
than
pitied
strange
that
she
would
not
even
give
edwin
the
opportunity
of
treating
her
as
a
widow
but
so
it
was
for
her
the
one
possible
attitude
towards
edwin
was
the
attitude
of
silence
in
the
silence
of
the
grave
her
love
for
him
existed
as
she
walked
along
the
chill
promenade
she
looked
with
discreet
curiosity
at
every
woman
she
met
to
see
her
condition
this
matter
which
before
she
had
never
thought
of
now
obsessed
her
and
all
women
were
divided
for
her
into
two
classes
the
expectant
and
the
others
also
her
was
extreme
more
so
even
than
it
had
been
after
her
mother
death
she
was
not
frightened
yet
she
was
assuredly
not
rather
her
mood
was
grim
harsh
and
calmly
bitter
she
thought
i
suppose
george
must
be
informed
it
affected
her
queerly
that
if
she
took
it
into
her
head
she
need
never
go
back
to
preston
street
she
was
free
she
owed
nothing
to
anybody
and
yet
she
would
go
back
she
would
require
a
home
soon
and
she
would
require
a
livelihood
for
the
shares
of
the
brighton
hotel
continental
limited
promised
to
be
sterile
and
were
already
unsaleable
but
apart
from
these
considerations
she
would
have
gone
back
for
sarah
gailey
because
sarah
gailey
was
entirely
dependent
on
her
she
detested
sarah
despite
sarah
sufferings
and
yet
by
her
conscience
she
was
for
ever
bound
to
her
the
future
loomed
appalling
sarah
career
was
finished
she
could
not
be
anything
but
a
burden
and
a
torment
her
last
years
would
probably
be
dreadful
both
for
herself
and
for
others
the
prospects
of
the
were
not
radiant
hilda
could
direct
the
enterprise
but
not
well
she
could
work
but
she
had
not
the
art
of
making
others
work
already
the
place
was
slightly
at
sixes
and
sevens
and
she
loathed
it
she
loathed
the
whole
business
of
catering
along
the
entire
length
of
the
king
road
the
smells
of
basement
kitchens
ascended
to
the
pavement
and
offended
the
nose
and
hilda
saw
all
brighton
as
a
colossal
and
disgusting
enlargement
of
the
kitchen
at
no
she
saw
the
background
and
the
pits
of
brighton
that
which
underlies
and
hides
behind
and
is
not
seen
the
grandeur
of
the
king
road
was
naught
to
her
her
glance
pierced
it
and
it
faded
to
a
hallucination
beyond
it
she
envisaged
the
years
to
come
the
messy
and
endless
struggle
the
necessary
avarice
and
trickeries
incidental
to
it
and
perhaps
the
ultimate
failure
she
would
never
make
money
she
felt
that
she
was
not
born
to
make
money
especially
by
dodges
and
false
politeness
out
of
idle
boarders
she
would
lose
it
and
lose
it
and
she
pictured
what
she
would
be
in
ten
years
the
landlady
up
to
every
subterfuge
with
a
child
to
feed
and
educate
and
perhaps
a
bedridden
querulous
invalid
to
support
and
there
was
no
alternative
to
the
tableau
she
went
by
the
chichester
which
towered
with
all
its
stories
above
her
head
who
would
take
it
now
george
cannon
would
have
made
it
pay
he
would
have
made
anything
pay
how
she
was
definitely
cut
off
from
the
magnificence
of
the
king
road
the
side
street
was
her
destiny
the
side
street
and
shabbiness
and
it
was
all
george
fault
and
hers
the
poverty
if
it
came
would
be
george
fault
alone
for
he
had
squandered
her
money
in
a
speculation
it
astounded
her
that
george
so
shrewd
and
well
balanced
should
have
made
an
investment
so
foolish
she
did
not
realize
that
a
passion
for
a
business
enterprise
as
for
a
woman
is
capable
of
destroying
the
balance
of
any
man
and
george
cannon
had
had
both
passions
and
then
she
saw
florrie
bagster
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
walking
leisurely
by
the
alone
if
boutwood
had
had
a
more
generous
and
wild
disposition
he
might
have
allowed
florrie
to
ruin
him
in
six
months
of
furs
and
carriages
and
champagne
but
boutwood
though
a
dog
was
a
careful
dog
especially
at
those
moments
when
the
conventional
dog
can
refuse
nothing
florrie
was
well
and
warmly
dressed
no
more
and
she
was
on
foot
hilda
gaze
fastened
on
her
and
immediately
divined
from
the
cut
and
fall
of
the
coat
that
florrie
had
something
to
conceal
from
every
one
but
her
boutwood
and
whereas
florrie
trod
the
pavement
with
a
charming
little
air
that
wavered
between
impudence
and
modesty
between
timid
meekness
and
conceit
hilda
blushed
with
shame
and
pity
she
on
one
footpath
and
florrie
on
the
other
soon
she
thought
i
shall
not
be
able
to
walk
along
this
road
she
had
sinned
she
admitted
that
she
had
sinned
against
some
quality
in
herself
but
how
innocently
and
how
ignorantly
and
what
a
tremendous
punishment
for
so
transient
a
weakness
and
new
consequences
still
more
disastrous
than
any
she
had
foreseen
presented
themselves
one
after
another
george
had
escaped
but
a
word
of
open
scandal
a
single
whisper
in
the
ear
of
the
old
creature
down
at
torquay
might
actuate
machinery
that
would
reach
out
after
him
and
drag
him
back
and
plant
him
in
jail
george
the
father
of
her
child
in
jail
it
was
all
a
matter
of
chance
sheer
chance
she
began
to
perceive
what
life
really
was
and
the
immense
importance
of
hazard
therein
nevertheless
without
frailty
without
defection
what
could
chance
have
done
she
began
to
perceive
that
this
that
she
was
living
through
was
life
she
bit
her
lips
grief
shame
disillusion
hardship
peril
catastrophe
exile
above
all
exile
these
had
to
be
faced
and
they
would
be
faced
she
recalled
the
firiest
verse
of
crashaw
and
she
set
her
shoulders
back
there
was
the
stuff
of
a
woman
in
her
only
a
little
while
and
she
had
seen
before
her
a
beloved
boy
entranced
by
her
charm
she
had
now
no
charm
where
now
was
the
soft
virgin
and
yet
somehow
magically
miraculously
the
soft
virgin
was
still
there
and
the
invincible
vague
hope
of
youth
and
the
irrepressible
consciousness
of
power
were
almost
ready
to
flame
up
afresh
contrary
to
all
reason
and
irradiate
her
starless
soul

history
of
hilda
lessways
