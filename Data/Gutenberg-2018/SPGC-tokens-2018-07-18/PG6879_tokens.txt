i

outside
do
be
an
idiot
man
i
bagged
it
first
my
dear
chap
i
been
waiting
here
a
month
when
you
fellows
have
finished
rotting
about
in
front
of
that
bath
do
let
detain
you
anybody
seen
that
sponge
well
look
here
this
in
a
tone
of
compromise
let
toss
for
it
all
right
odd
man
out
all
of
which
being
interpreted
meant
that
the
first
match
of
the
easter
term
had
just
come
to
an
end
and
that
those
of
the
team
who
being
day
boys
changed
over
at
the
pavilion
instead
of
performing
the
operation
at
leisure
and
in
comfort
as
did
the
members
of
houses
were
discussing
the
vital
question
who
was
to
have
first
bath
the
field
sports
committee
at
wrykyn
that
is
at
the
school
which
stood
some
outside
that
town
and
took
its
name
from
it
were
not
lavish
in
their
expenditure
as
regarded
the
changing
accommodation
in
the
pavilion
letters
appeared
in
every
second
number
of
the
some
short
others
long
some
from
members
of
the
school
others
from
old
boys
all
protesting
against
the
condition
of
the
first
second
and
third
fifteen
indignant
would
inquire
acidly
in
half
a
page
of
small
type
if
the
editor
happened
to
be
aware
that
there
was
no
in
the
second
room
and
only
half
a
comb
disgusted
would
remark
that
when
he
came
down
with
the
wandering
zephyrs
to
play
against
the
third
fifteen
the
water
supply
had
suddenly
and
mysteriously
failed
and
the
had
been
obliged
to
go
home
as
they
were
in
a
state
of
primeval
grime
and
he
thought
that
this
was
a
very
bad
thing
in
a
school
of
over
six
hundred
boys
though
what
the
number
of
boys
had
to
do
with
the
fact
that
there
was
no
water
he
omitted
to
explain
the
editor
would
express
his
regret
in
brackets
and
things
would
go
on
as
before
there
was
only
one
bath
in
the
first
fifteen
room
and
there
were
on
the
present
occasion
six
claimants
to
it
and
each
claimant
was
of
the
fixed
opinion
that
whatever
happened
subsequently
he
was
going
to
have
it
first
finally
on
the
suggestion
of
otway
who
had
reduced
tossing
to
a
fine
art
a
mystic
game
of
tommy
dodd
was
played
otway
having
triumphantly
obtained
first
innings
the
conversation
reverted
to
the
subject
of
the
match
the
easter
term
always
opened
with
a
scratch
game
against
a
mixed
team
of
masters
and
old
boys
and
the
school
usually
won
without
any
great
exertion
on
this
occasion
the
match
had
been
rather
more
even
than
the
average
and
the
team
had
only
just
pulled
the
thing
off
by
a
couple
of
tries
to
a
goal
otway
expressed
an
opinion
that
the
school
had
played
badly
why
on
earth
do
you
forwards
let
the
ball
out
occasionally
he
asked
otway
was
one
of
the
first
fifteen
halves
they
were
so
jolly
heavy
in
the
scrum
said
maurice
one
of
the
forwards
and
when
we
did
let
it
out
the
outsides
nearly
always
mucked
it
well
it
was
the
halves
fault
we
always
got
it
out
to
the
centres
it
was
the
centres
put
in
robinson
they
played
awfully
well
trevor
was
ripping
trevor
always
is
said
otway
i
should
think
he
about
the
best
captain
we
had
here
for
a
long
time
he
certainly
one
of
the
best
centres
best
there
been
since
said
clephane
was
one
of
those
players
who
mark
an
epoch
he
had
been
in
the
team
fifteen
years
ago
and
had
left
wrykyn
to
captain
cambridge
and
play
three
years
in
succession
for
wales
the
school
regarded
the
standard
set
by
him
as
one
that
did
not
admit
of
comparison
however
good
a
wrykyn
centre
might
be
the
most
he
could
hope
to
be
considered
was
the
best
since
however
covered
fifteen
years
and
to
be
looked
on
as
the
best
centre
the
school
could
boast
of
during
that
time
meant
something
for
wrykyn
knew
how
to
play
football
since
it
had
been
decided
thus
that
the
faults
in
the
school
attack
did
not
lie
with
the
halves
forwards
or
centres
it
was
more
or
less
evident
that
they
must
be
attributable
to
the
wings
and
the
search
for
the
weak
spot
was
even
further
narrowed
down
by
the
general
verdict
that
clowes
on
the
left
wing
had
played
well
with
a
beautiful
unanimity
the
six
occupants
of
the
first
fifteen
room
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
man
who
had
let
the
team
down
that
day
had
been
the
man
on
the
right
to
wit
of
seymour
i
bet
he
does
stay
in
the
first
long
said
clephane
who
was
now
in
the
bath
otway
retired
i
suppose
they
had
to
try
him
as
he
was
the
senior
wing
of
the
second
but
he
no
earthly
good
he
only
got
into
the
second
because
he
big
was
robinson
opinion
a
man
who
big
and
strong
can
always
get
his
second
colours
even
if
he
a
funk
like
said
clephane
did
any
of
you
chaps
notice
the
way
he
let
paget
through
that
time
he
scored
for
them
he
simply
did
attempt
to
tackle
him
he
could
have
brought
him
down
like
a
shot
if
he
only
gone
for
him
paget
was
running
straight
along
the
and
had
any
room
to
dodge
i
know
trevor
was
jolly
sick
about
it
and
then
he
let
him
through
once
before
in
just
the
same
way
in
the
first
half
only
trevor
got
round
and
stopped
him
he
was
rank
missed
every
other
pass
too
said
otway
clephane
summed
up
he
was
rank
he
said
again
trevor
wo
keep
him
in
the
team
long
i
wish
paget
had
left
said
otway
referring
to
the
wing
who
by
leaving
unexpectedly
at
the
end
of
the
christmas
term
had
let
into
the
team
his
loss
was
likely
to
be
felt
up
till
christmas
wrykyn
had
done
well
and
paget
had
been
their
scoring
man
had
occupied
a
similar
position
in
the
second
fifteen
he
was
big
and
speedy
and
in
second
fifteen
matches
these
qualities
make
up
for
a
great
deal
if
a
man
scores
one
or
two
tries
in
nearly
every
match
people
are
inclined
to
overlook
in
him
such
failings
as
timidity
and
clumsiness
it
is
only
when
he
comes
to
be
tried
in
football
of
a
higher
class
that
he
is
seen
through
in
the
second
fifteen
the
fact
that
was
afraid
to
tackle
his
man
had
almost
escaped
notice
but
the
habit
would
not
do
in
first
fifteen
circles
all
the
same
said
clephane
pursuing
his
subject
if
they
play
him
i
do
see
who
they
going
to
get
he
the
best
of
the
second
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
was
this
very
problem
that
was
puzzling
trevor
as
he
walked
off
the
field
with
paget
and
clowes
when
they
had
got
into
their
blazers
after
the
match
clowes
was
in
the
same
house
as
trevor
donaldson
and
paget
was
staying
there
too
he
had
been
head
of
donaldson
up
to
christmas
it
strikes
me
said
paget
the
school
have
got
over
the
holidays
yet
i
never
saw
such
a
lot
of
slackers
you
ought
to
have
taken
thirty
points
off
the
sort
of
team
you
had
against
you
today
have
you
ever
known
the
school
play
well
on
the
second
day
of
term
asked
clowes
the
forwards
always
play
as
if
the
whole
thing
bored
them
to
death
it
was
the
forwards
that
mattered
so
much
said
trevor
shake
down
all
right
after
a
few
matches
a
little
running
and
passing
will
put
them
right
let
hope
so
paget
observed
or
we
might
as
well
scratch
to
ripton
at
once
there
a
jolly
sight
too
much
of
the
and
christmas
pudding
about
their
play
at
present
there
was
a
pause
then
paget
brought
out
the
question
towards
which
he
had
been
moving
all
the
time
what
do
you
think
of
he
asked
it
was
pretty
clear
by
the
way
he
spoke
what
he
thought
of
that
player
himself
but
in
discussing
with
a
football
captain
the
capabilities
of
the
various
members
of
his
team
it
is
best
to
avoid
a
too
positive
statement
one
way
or
the
other
before
one
has
heard
his
views
on
the
subject
and
paget
was
one
of
those
people
who
like
to
know
the
opinions
of
others
before
committing
themselves
clowes
on
the
other
hand
was
in
the
habit
of
forming
his
views
on
his
own
account
and
expressing
them
if
people
agreed
with
them
well
and
good
it
afforded
strong
presumptive
evidence
of
their
sanity
if
they
disagreed
it
was
unfortunate
but
he
was
not
going
to
alter
his
opinions
for
that
unless
convinced
at
great
length
that
they
were
unsound
he
summed
things
up
and
gave
you
the
result
you
could
take
it
or
leave
it
as
you
preferred
i
thought
he
was
bad
said
clowes
bad
exclaimed
trevor
he
was
a
disgrace
one
can
understand
a
chap
having
his
at
any
game
but
one
does
expect
a
man
in
the
wrykyn
first
to
funk
he
mucked
five
out
of
every
six
passes
i
gave
him
too
and
the
ball
was
a
bit
slippery
still
i
should
mind
that
so
much
if
he
had
only
gone
for
his
man
properly
it
is
being
out
of
practice
that
makes
you
funk
and
even
when
he
did
have
a
try
at
you
paget
he
always
went
high
that
said
clowes
thoughtfully
would
seem
to
show
that
he
was
game
nobody
so
much
as
smiled
nobody
ever
did
smile
at
clowes
essays
in
wit
perhaps
because
of
the
solemn
almost
sad
tone
of
voice
in
which
he
delivered
them
he
was
tall
and
dark
and
thin
and
had
a
pensive
eye
which
encouraged
the
more
soulful
of
his
female
relatives
to
entertain
hopes
that
he
would
some
day
take
orders
well
said
paget
relieved
at
finding
that
he
did
not
stand
alone
in
his
views
on
performance
i
must
say
i
thought
he
was
awfully
bad
myself
i
shall
try
somebody
else
next
match
said
trevor
it
be
rather
hard
though
the
man
one
would
naturally
put
in
bryce
left
at
christmas
worse
luck
bryce
was
the
other
wing
of
the
second
fifteen
is
there
anybody
in
the
third
asked
paget
barry
said
clowes
briefly
clowes
thinks
barry
good
explained
trevor
he
good
said
clowes
i
admit
he
small
but
he
can
tackle
the
question
is
would
he
be
any
good
in
the
first
a
chap
might
do
jolly
well
for
the
third
and
still
not
be
worth
trying
for
the
first
i
do
remember
much
about
barry
said
paget
except
being
collared
by
him
when
we
played
seymour
last
year
in
the
final
i
certainly
came
away
with
a
sort
of
impression
that
he
could
tackle
i
thought
he
marked
me
jolly
well
there
you
are
then
said
clowes
a
year
ago
barry
could
tackle
paget
there
no
reason
for
supposing
that
he
fallen
off
since
then
we
seen
that
tackle
paget
ergo
barry
is
better
worth
playing
for
the
team
than
all
right
then
replied
trevor
there
ca
be
any
harm
in
trying
him
we
have
another
scratch
game
on
thursday
will
you
be
here
then
paget
oh
yes
i
stopping
till
saturday
good
man
then
we
shall
be
able
to
see
how
he
does
against
you
i
wish
you
had
left
though
by
jove
we
should
have
had
ripton
on
toast
the
same
as
last
term
wrykyn
played
five
schools
but
six
school
matches
the
school
that
they
played
twice
in
the
season
was
ripton
to
win
one
ripton
match
meant
that
however
many
losses
it
might
have
sustained
in
the
other
matches
the
school
had
had
at
any
rate
a
passable
season
to
win
two
ripton
matches
in
the
same
year
was
almost
unheard
of
this
year
there
had
seemed
every
likelihood
of
it
the
match
before
christmas
on
the
ripton
ground
had
resulted
in
a
win
for
wrykyn
by
two
goals
and
a
try
to
a
try
but
the
calculations
of
the
school
had
been
upset
by
the
sudden
departure
of
paget
at
the
end
of
term
and
also
of
bryce
who
had
hitherto
been
regarded
as
his
understudy
and
in
the
first
ripton
match
the
two
goals
had
both
been
scored
by
paget
and
both
had
been
brilliant
bits
of
individual
play
which
a
lesser
man
could
not
have
carried
through
the
conclusion
therefore
at
which
the
school
reluctantly
arrived
was
that
their
chances
of
winning
the
second
match
could
not
be
judged
by
their
previous
success
they
would
have
to
approach
the
easter
term
fixture
from
another
a
standpoint
in
these
circumstances
it
became
a
serious
problem
who
was
to
get
the
fifteenth
place
whoever
played
in
paget
stead
against
ripton
would
be
certain
if
the
match
were
won
to
receive
his
colours
who
then
would
fill
the
vacancy
of
course
said
the
crowd
but
the
experts
as
we
have
shown
were
of
a
different
opinion
ii
the
gold
bat
trevor
did
not
take
long
to
resume
a
garb
of
civilisation
he
never
wasted
much
time
over
anything
he
was
gifted
with
a
boundless
energy
which
might
possibly
have
made
him
unpopular
had
he
not
justified
it
by
results
the
football
of
the
school
had
never
been
in
such
a
flourishing
condition
as
it
had
attained
to
on
his
succeeding
to
the
captaincy
it
was
not
only
that
the
first
fifteen
was
good
the
excellence
of
a
first
fifteen
does
not
always
depend
on
the
captain
but
the
games
even
down
to
the
very
humblest
junior
game
had
woken
up
one
morning
at
the
beginning
of
the
previous
term
to
find
themselves
much
to
their
surprise
organised
going
concerns
like
the
immortal
captain
pott
trevor
was
a
terror
to
the
shirker
and
the
lubber
and
the
resemblance
was
further
increased
by
the
fact
that
he
was
a
toughish
lot
who
was
little
but
steel
and
at
first
sight
his
appearance
was
not
imposing
paterfamilias
who
had
heard
his
son
eulogies
on
trevor
performances
during
the
holidays
and
came
down
to
watch
the
school
play
a
match
was
generally
rather
disappointed
on
seeing
five
feet
six
where
he
had
looked
for
at
least
six
foot
one
and
ten
stone
where
he
had
expected
thirteen
but
then
what
there
was
of
trevor
was
as
previously
remarked
steel
and
and
he
certainly
played
football
like
a
miniature
stoddart
it
was
characteristic
of
him
that
though
this
was
the
first
match
of
the
term
his
condition
seemed
to
be
as
good
as
possible
he
had
done
all
his
own
work
on
the
field
and
most
of
and
apparently
had
not
turned
a
hair
he
was
one
of
those
conscientious
people
who
train
in
the
holidays
when
he
had
changed
he
went
down
the
passage
to
clowes
study
clowes
was
in
the
position
he
frequently
took
up
when
the
weather
was
good
wedged
into
his
window
in
a
sitting
position
one
leg
in
the
study
the
other
hanging
outside
over
space
the
indoor
leg
lacked
a
boot
so
that
it
was
evident
that
its
owner
had
at
least
had
the
energy
to
begin
to
change
that
he
had
given
the
thing
up
after
that
exhausted
with
the
effort
was
what
one
naturally
expected
from
clowes
he
would
have
made
a
splendid
actor
he
was
so
good
at
resting
hurry
up
and
dress
said
trevor
i
want
you
to
come
over
to
the
baths
what
on
earth
do
you
want
over
at
the
baths
i
want
to
see
oh
yes
i
remember
dexter
are
camping
out
there
are
they
i
heard
they
were
why
is
it
one
of
the
dexter
kids
got
measles
in
the
last
week
of
the
holidays
so
they
shunted
all
the
beds
and
things
across
and
the
chaps
went
back
there
instead
of
to
the
house
in
the
winter
term
the
baths
were
always
boarded
over
and
converted
into
a
sort
of
extra
gymnasium
where
you
could
go
and
box
or
fence
when
there
was
no
room
to
do
it
in
the
real
gymnasium
socker
and
were
also
largely
played
there
the
floor
being
admirably
suited
to
such
games
though
the
light
was
always
rather
tricky
and
prevented
heavy
scoring
i
should
think
said
clowes
from
what
i
seen
of
beauties
that
dexter
would
like
them
to
camp
out
at
the
bottom
of
the
baths
all
the
year
round
it
would
be
a
happy
release
for
him
if
they
were
all
drowned
and
i
suppose
if
he
had
to
choose
any
one
of
them
for
a
violent
death
he
pick
must
be
a
boon
to
a
i
known
chaps
break
rules
when
the
spirit
moved
them
but
he
the
only
one
i
met
who
breaks
them
all
day
long
and
well
into
the
night
simply
for
amusement
i
often
thought
of
writing
to
the
about
it
i
suppose
you
could
call
dexter
an
animal
all
right
right
enough
really
a
man
like
dexter
would
make
any
fellow
run
amuck
and
then
an
irishman
to
start
with
which
makes
a
difference
there
is
usually
one
house
in
every
school
of
the
black
sheep
sort
and
if
you
go
to
the
root
of
the
matter
you
will
generally
find
that
the
fault
is
with
the
master
of
that
house
a
who
enters
into
the
life
of
his
house
coaches
them
in
games
if
an
athlete
or
if
not
an
athlete
watches
the
games
umpiring
at
cricket
and
refereeing
at
football
never
finds
much
difficulty
in
keeping
order
it
may
be
accepted
as
fact
that
the
juniors
of
a
house
will
never
be
orderly
of
their
own
free
will
but
disturbances
in
the
junior
do
not
make
the
house
undisciplined
the
prefects
are
the
criterion
if
you
find
them
joining
in
the
general
rags
and
even
starting
private
ones
on
their
own
account
then
you
may
safely
say
that
it
is
time
the
master
of
that
house
retired
from
the
business
and
took
to
and
that
was
the
state
of
things
in
dexter
it
was
the
most
lawless
of
the
houses
mr
dexter
belonged
to
a
type
of
master
almost
unknown
at
a
public
school
the
usher
type
in
a
private
school
he
might
have
passed
at
wrykyn
he
was
out
of
place
to
him
the
whole
duty
of
a
appeared
to
be
to
wage
war
against
his
house
when
dexter
won
the
final
for
the
cricket
cup
in
the
summer
term
of
two
years
back
the
match
lasted
four
afternoons
four
solid
afternoons
of
glorious
cricket
mr
dexter
did
not
see
a
single
ball
of
that
match
bowled
he
was
prowling
in
sequestered
lanes
and
barns
out
of
bounds
on
the
that
he
might
catch
some
member
of
his
house
smoking
there
as
if
the
whole
of
the
house
from
the
head
to
the
smallest
fag
were
not
on
the
field
watching
day
best
bats
collapse
before
henderson
bowling
and
moriarty
hit
up
that
marvellous
and
unexpected
at
the
end
of
the
second
innings
that
sort
of
thing
definitely
stamps
a
master
what
do
you
want
to
see
about
asked
clowes
he
got
my
little
gold
bat
i
lent
it
him
in
the
holidays
a
remark
which
needs
a
footnote
the
bat
referred
to
was
made
of
gold
and
was
about
an
inch
long
by
an
eighth
broad
it
had
come
into
existence
some
ten
years
previously
in
the
following
manner
the
cricket
cup
at
wrykyn
had
originally
been
a
rather
tarnished
and
unimpressive
vessel
whose
only
merit
consisted
in
the
fact
that
it
was
of
silver
ten
years
ago
an
old
wrykinian
suddenly
reflecting
that
it
would
not
be
a
bad
idea
to
do
something
for
the
school
in
a
small
way
hied
him
to
the
nearest
jeweller
and
purchased
another
silver
cup
vast
withal
and
cunningly
decorated
with
filigree
work
and
standing
on
a
massive
ebony
plinth
round
which
were
little
silver
lozenges
just
big
enough
to
hold
the
name
of
the
winning
house
and
the
year
of
grace
this
he
presented
with
his
blessing
to
be
competed
for
by
the
dozen
houses
that
made
up
the
school
of
wrykyn
and
it
was
formally
established
as
the
house
cricket
cup
the
question
now
arose
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
other
cup
the
school
house
who
happened
to
be
the
holders
at
the
time
suggested
disinterestedly
that
it
should
become
the
property
of
the
house
which
had
won
it
last
not
so
replied
the
field
sports
committee
but
far
otherwise
we
will
have
it
melted
down
in
a
fiery
furnace
and
thereafter
fashioned
into
eleven
little
silver
bats
and
these
little
silver
bats
shall
be
the
guerdon
of
the
eleven
members
of
the
winning
team
to
have
and
to
hold
for
the
space
of
one
year
unless
by
winning
the
cup
twice
in
succession
they
gain
the
right
of
keeping
the
bat
for
yet
another
year
how
is
that
umpire
and
the
authorities
replied
o
men
of
infinite
resource
and
sagacity
verily
is
it
a
cold
day
when
get
left
behind
forge
ahead
but
when
they
had
forged
ahead
behold
it
would
not
run
to
eleven
little
silver
bats
but
only
to
ten
little
silver
bats
thereupon
the
headmaster
a
man
liberal
with
his
cash
caused
an
eleventh
little
bat
to
be
fashioned
for
the
captain
of
the
winning
team
to
have
and
to
hold
in
the
manner
aforesaid
and
to
single
it
out
from
the
others
it
was
wrought
not
of
silver
but
of
gold
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
at
the
time
of
our
story
trevor
was
in
possession
of
the
little
gold
bat
because
donaldson
had
won
the
cup
in
the
previous
summer
and
he
had
captained
them
and
incidentally
had
scored
without
a
mistake
well
i
hanged
if
i
would
trust
with
my
bat
said
clowes
referring
to
the
silver
ornament
on
his
own
he
probably
pawned
yours
in
the
holidays
why
did
you
lend
it
to
him
his
people
wanted
to
see
it
i
know
him
at
home
you
know
they
asked
me
to
lunch
the
last
day
but
one
of
the
holidays
and
we
got
talking
about
the
bat
because
of
course
if
we
had
beaten
dexter
in
the
final
would
have
had
it
himself
so
i
sent
it
over
next
day
with
a
note
asking
to
bring
it
back
with
him
here
oh
well
there
a
chance
then
seeing
he
only
had
it
so
little
time
that
he
has
pawned
it
yet
you
better
rush
off
and
get
it
back
as
soon
as
possible
it
no
good
waiting
for
me
i
sha
be
ready
for
weeks
where
paget
teaing
with
donaldson
at
least
he
said
he
was
going
to
then
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
go
alone
i
hate
walking
alone
if
you
hurry
said
clowes
scanning
the
road
from
his
post
of
vantage
you
be
able
to
go
with
your
fascinating
pal
ruthven
just
gone
out
trevor
dashed
downstairs
in
his
energetic
way
and
overtook
the
youth
referred
to
clowes
brooded
over
them
from
above
like
a
sorrowful
and
rather
disgusted
providence
trevor
liking
for
ruthven
who
was
a
donaldsonite
like
himself
was
one
of
the
few
points
on
which
the
two
had
any
real
disagreement
clowes
could
not
understand
how
any
person
in
his
senses
could
of
his
own
free
will
make
an
intimate
friend
of
ruthven
hullo
trevor
said
ruthven
come
over
to
the
baths
said
trevor
i
want
to
see
about
something
or
were
you
going
somewhere
else
i
was
going
anywhere
in
particular
i
never
know
what
to
do
in
it
deadly
dull
trevor
could
never
understand
how
any
one
could
find
dull
for
his
own
part
there
always
seemed
too
much
to
do
in
the
time
you
are
allowed
to
play
games
he
said
remembering
something
about
a
doctor
certificate
in
the
past
no
said
ruthven
thank
goodness
he
added
which
remark
silenced
trevor
to
a
person
who
thanked
goodness
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
play
games
he
could
find
nothing
to
say
but
he
ceased
to
wonder
how
it
was
that
ruthven
was
dull
they
proceeded
to
the
baths
together
in
silence
they
were
informed
by
a
dexter
fag
who
met
them
outside
the
door
was
not
about
when
he
comes
back
said
trevor
tell
him
i
want
him
to
come
to
tea
tomorrow
directly
after
school
and
bring
my
bat
do
forget
the
fag
promised
to
make
a
point
of
it
iii
the
mayor
statue
one
of
the
rules
that
governed
the
life
of
donough
the
descendant
of
the
of
castle
taterfields
clare
ireland
was
never
refuse
the
offer
of
a
free
tea
so
on
receipt
per
the
dexter
fag
referred
to
of
trevor
invitation
he
scratched
one
engagement
with
his
mathematical
master
not
wholly
unconnected
with
the
of
examples
to
in
hall
and
knight
algebra
postponed
another
with
his
friend
and
ally
moriarty
of
dexter
who
wished
to
box
with
him
in
the
gymnasium
and
made
his
way
at
a
leisurely
pace
towards
donaldson
he
was
feeling
particularly
pleased
with
himself
today
for
several
reasons
he
had
begun
the
day
well
by
scoring
brilliantly
off
mr
dexter
across
the
matutinal
rasher
and
coffee
in
morning
school
he
had
been
put
on
to
translate
the
one
passage
which
he
happened
to
have
prepared
the
first
ten
lines
in
fact
of
the
hundred
which
formed
the
morning
lesson
and
in
the
final
hour
of
afternoon
school
which
was
devoted
to
french
he
had
discovered
and
exploited
with
great
success
an
entirely
new
and
original
form
of
ragging
this
he
felt
was
the
strenuous
life
this
was
living
one
life
as
one
life
should
be
lived
he
met
trevor
at
the
gate
as
they
were
going
in
a
carriage
and
pair
dashed
past
its
cargo
consisted
of
two
people
the
headmaster
looking
bored
and
a
small
dapper
man
with
a
very
red
face
who
looked
excited
and
was
talking
volubly
trevor
and
raised
their
caps
as
the
chariot
swept
by
but
the
salute
passed
unnoticed
the
head
appeared
to
be
wrapped
in
thought
what
the
old
man
doing
in
a
carriage
i
wonder
said
trevor
looking
after
them
who
that
with
him
that
said
is
sir
eustace
briggs
who
sir
eustace
briggs
explained
in
a
rich
brogue
that
sir
eustace
was
mayor
of
wrykyn
a
keen
politician
and
a
hater
of
the
irish
nation
judging
by
his
letters
and
speeches
they
went
into
trevor
study
clowes
was
occupying
the
window
in
his
usual
manner
hullo
he
said
there
is
an
air
of
quiet
satisfaction
about
you
that
seems
to
show
that
you
been
ragging
dexter
have
you
oh
that
was
only
this
morning
at
breakfast
the
best
rag
was
in
french
replied
who
then
proceeded
to
explain
in
detail
the
methods
he
had
employed
to
embitter
the
existence
of
the
hapless
gallic
exile
with
whom
he
had
come
in
contact
it
was
that
gentleman
custom
to
sit
on
a
certain
desk
while
conducting
the
lesson
this
desk
chanced
to
be
on
the
principle
that
a
man
may
do
what
he
likes
with
his
own
he
had
entered
the
room
privily
in
the
and
removed
the
screws
from
his
desk
with
the
result
that
for
the
first
of
the
lesson
the
class
had
been
occupied
in
excavating
gandinois
from
the
ruins
that
gentleman
first
act
on
regaining
his
equilibrium
had
been
to
send
out
of
the
room
and
who
had
foreseen
this
emergency
had
spent
a
very
pleasant
in
the
passage
with
some
mixed
chocolates
and
a
copy
of
mr
it
was
his
notion
of
a
cheerful
and
instructive
french
lesson
what
were
you
talking
about
when
you
came
in
asked
clowes
been
slanging
ireland
the
man
briggs
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
are
you
going
to
take
any
steps
is
it
steps
said
warmly
and
have
we
he
stopped
well
ye
know
he
said
seriously
ye
must
let
it
go
any
further
i
shall
get
sacked
if
it
found
out
an
so
will
moriarty
too
why
asked
trevor
looking
up
from
the
he
was
filling
what
on
earth
have
you
been
doing
would
it
be
rather
a
cheery
idea
suggested
clowes
if
you
began
at
the
beginning
well
ye
see
began
it
was
this
way
the
first
i
heard
of
it
was
from
dexter
he
was
trying
to
score
off
me
as
usual
an
he
said
ye
seen
the
paper
this
morning
i
said
no
i
had
not
then
he
said
he
said
should
look
at
it
there
something
there
that
ye
find
interesting
i
said
sir
in
me
respectful
way
said
he
irish
members
have
been
making
their
customary
disturbances
in
the
house
why
is
it
he
said
irishmen
are
always
thrusting
themselves
forward
and
making
disturbances
for
purposes
of
indeed
sir
said
i
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
and
after
that
the
conversation
ceased
go
on
said
clowes
after
breakfast
moriarty
came
to
me
with
a
paper
and
showed
me
what
they
had
been
saying
about
the
irish
there
was
a
letter
from
the
man
briggs
on
the
subject
very
sensible
and
temperate
letter
from
sir
eustace
briggs
they
called
it
but
bedad
if
that
was
a
temperate
letter
i
should
like
to
know
what
an
intemperate
one
is
well
we
read
it
through
and
moriarty
said
to
me
we
let
this
stay
as
it
is
and
i
said
we
ca
said
moriarty
to
me
are
we
to
do
about
it
i
should
like
to
tar
and
feather
the
man
he
said
ca
do
that
i
said
why
not
tar
and
feather
his
statue
i
said
so
we
thought
we
would
ye
know
where
the
statue
is
i
suppose
it
in
the
recreation
ground
just
across
the
river
i
know
the
place
said
clowes
go
on
this
is
ripping
i
always
knew
you
were
pretty
mad
but
this
sounds
as
if
it
were
going
to
beat
all
previous
records
have
ye
seen
the
baths
this
term
continued
since
they
shifted
dexter
house
into
them
the
beds
are
in
two
long
rows
along
each
wall
moriarty
and
mine
are
the
last
two
at
the
end
farthest
from
the
door
just
under
the
gallery
said
trevor
i
see
that
it
well
at
ten
sharp
every
night
dexter
sees
that
we
all
in
locks
the
door
and
goes
off
to
sleep
at
the
old
man
and
we
do
see
him
again
till
breakfast
he
turns
the
gas
off
from
outside
at
seven
the
next
morning
smith
smith
was
one
of
the
school
porters
unlocks
the
door
and
calls
us
and
we
go
over
to
the
hall
to
breakfast
well
well
directly
everybody
was
asleep
last
night
it
was
till
after
one
as
there
was
a
rag
on
moriarty
and
i
got
up
dressed
and
climbed
up
into
the
gallery
ye
know
the
gallery
windows
they
open
at
the
top
an
it
rather
hard
to
get
out
of
them
but
we
managed
it
and
dropped
on
to
the
gravel
outside
long
drop
said
clowes
yes
i
hurt
myself
rather
but
it
was
in
a
good
cause
i
dropped
first
and
while
i
was
on
the
ground
moriarty
came
on
top
of
me
that
how
i
got
hurt
but
it
was
much
and
we
cut
across
the
grounds
and
over
the
fence
and
down
to
the
river
it
was
a
fine
night
and
not
very
dark
and
everything
smelt
ripping
down
by
the
river
do
get
poetical
said
clowes
stick
to
the
point
we
got
into
the
how
asked
the
practical
trevor
for
the
was
wont
to
be
locked
at
one
in
the
morning
moriarty
had
a
key
that
fitted
explained
briefly
we
got
in
and
launched
a
boat
a
big
tub
put
in
the
tar
and
a
couple
of
brushes
there
always
tar
in
the
and
rowed
across
wait
a
bit
interrupted
trevor
you
said
tar
and
feathers
where
did
you
get
the
feathers
we
used
leaves
they
do
just
as
well
and
there
were
heaps
on
the
bank
well
when
we
landed
we
tied
up
the
boat
and
bucked
across
to
the
recreation
ground
we
got
over
the
railings
beastly
spiky
railings
and
went
over
to
the
statue
ye
know
where
the
statue
stands
it
right
in
the
middle
of
the
place
where
everybody
can
see
it
moriarty
got
up
first
and
i
handed
him
the
tar
and
a
brush
then
i
went
up
with
the
other
brush
and
we
began
we
did
his
face
first
it
was
too
dark
to
see
really
well
but
i
think
we
made
a
good
job
of
it
when
we
had
put
about
as
much
tar
on
as
we
thought
would
do
we
took
out
the
leaves
which
we
were
carrying
in
our
pockets
and
spread
them
on
then
we
did
the
rest
of
him
and
after
about
half
an
hour
when
we
thought
we
done
about
enough
we
got
into
our
boat
again
and
came
back
and
what
did
you
do
till
seven
we
could
get
back
the
way
we
come
so
we
slept
in
the
well
i
hanged
was
trevor
comment
on
the
story
clowes
roared
with
laughter
was
a
perpetual
joy
to
him
as
was
going
trevor
asked
him
for
his
gold
bat
you
have
lost
it
i
hope
he
said
felt
in
his
pocket
but
brought
his
hand
out
at
once
and
transferred
it
to
another
pocket
a
look
of
anxiety
came
over
his
face
and
was
reflected
in
trevor
i
could
have
sworn
it
was
in
that
pocket
he
said
you
lost
it
queried
trevor
again
he
has
said
clowes
confidently
if
you
want
to
know
where
that
bat
is
i
should
say
you
find
it
somewhere
between
the
baths
and
the
statue
at
the
foot
of
the
statue
for
choice
it
seems
to
me
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
that
you
have
been
and
gone
and
done
it
me
broth
av
a
bhoy
gave
up
the
search
it
gone
he
said
man
i
most
awfully
sorry
i
sooner
have
lost
a
note
i
do
see
why
you
should
lose
either
snapped
trevor
why
the
blazes
ca
you
be
more
careful
was
too
penitent
for
words
clowes
took
it
on
himself
to
point
out
the
bright
side
there
nothing
to
get
sick
about
really
he
said
if
the
thing
does
turn
up
though
it
probably
will
you
simply
have
to
tell
the
old
man
that
it
lost
he
have
another
made
you
wo
be
asked
for
it
till
just
before
sports
day
either
so
you
will
have
plenty
of
time
to
find
it
the
challenge
cups
and
also
the
bats
had
to
be
given
to
the
authorities
before
the
sports
to
be
formally
presented
on
sports
day
oh
i
suppose
it
be
all
right
said
trevor
but
i
hope
it
be
found
anywhere
near
the
statue
said
he
hoped
so
too
iv
the
league
warning
the
team
to
play
in
any
match
was
always
put
upon
the
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
in
the
senior
block
a
day
before
the
date
of
the
fixture
both
first
and
second
fifteens
had
matches
on
the
thursday
of
this
week
the
second
were
playing
a
team
brought
down
by
an
old
wrykinian
the
first
had
a
scratch
game
when
barry
accompanied
by
who
shared
his
study
at
and
rarely
left
him
for
two
minutes
on
end
passed
by
the
at
the
quarter
to
eleven
interval
it
was
to
the
second
fifteen
list
that
he
turned
his
attention
now
that
bryce
had
left
he
thought
he
might
have
a
chance
of
getting
into
the
second
his
only
real
rival
he
considered
was
crawford
of
the
school
house
who
was
the
other
wing
of
the
third
fifteen
the
first
name
he
saw
on
the
list
was
crawford
it
seemed
to
be
written
twice
as
large
as
any
of
the
others
and
his
own
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
fact
that
he
had
half
expected
the
calamity
made
things
no
better
he
had
set
his
heart
on
playing
for
the
second
this
term
then
suddenly
he
noticed
a
remarkable
phenomenon
the
other
wing
was
if
was
playing
for
the
second
who
was
playing
for
the
first
he
looked
at
the
list
on
he
said
hastily
to
he
wanted
to
get
away
somewhere
where
his
agitated
condition
would
not
be
noticed
he
felt
quite
faint
at
the
shock
of
seeing
his
name
on
the
list
of
the
first
fifteen
there
it
was
however
as
large
as
life
m
barry
separated
from
the
rest
by
a
thin
red
line
but
still
there
in
his
most
optimistic
moments
he
had
never
dreamed
of
this
was
reading
slowly
through
the
list
of
the
second
he
did
everything
slowly
except
eating
come
on
said
barry
again
had
after
much
deliberation
arrived
at
a
profound
truth
he
turned
to
barry
and
imparted
his
discovery
to
him
in
the
weighty
manner
of
one
who
realises
the
importance
of
his
words
look
here
he
said
your
name
not
down
here
i
know
on
but
that
means
you
not
playing
for
the
second
of
course
it
does
well
if
you
are
coming
i
off
but
look
here
barry
disappeared
through
the
door
after
a
moment
pause
followed
him
he
came
up
with
him
on
the
senior
gravel
what
up
he
inquired
nothing
said
barry
are
you
sick
about
not
playing
for
the
second
no
you
are
really
come
and
have
a
bun
in
the
philosophy
of
it
was
indeed
a
sorrow
that
could
not
be
cured
by
the
internal
application
of
a
new
hot
bun
it
had
never
failed
in
his
own
case
bun
barry
was
quite
shocked
at
the
suggestion
i
ca
afford
to
get
myself
out
of
condition
with
beastly
buns
but
if
you
are
playing
you
ass
i
playing
for
the
first
now
do
you
see
gaped
his
mind
never
worked
very
rapidly
what
about
then
he
said
been
chucked
out
ca
you
understand
you
an
idiot
playing
for
the
second
and
i
playing
for
the
first
but
you
he
stopped
he
had
been
going
to
point
out
that
barry
tender
years
he
was
only
sixteen
and
smallness
would
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
play
with
success
for
the
first
fifteen
he
refrained
owing
to
a
conviction
that
the
remark
would
not
be
wholly
judicious
barry
was
touchy
on
the
subject
of
his
size
and
had
suffered
before
now
for
commenting
on
it
in
a
disparaging
spirit
i
tell
you
what
we
do
after
school
said
barry
we
have
some
running
and
passing
it
do
you
a
lot
of
good
and
i
want
to
practise
taking
passes
at
full
speed
you
can
trot
along
at
your
ordinary
pace
and
i
sprint
up
from
behind
saw
no
objection
to
that
trotting
along
at
his
ordinary
pace
five
miles
an
hour
would
just
suit
him
then
after
that
continued
barry
with
a
look
of
enthusiasm
i
want
to
practise
passing
back
to
my
centre
paget
used
to
do
it
awfully
well
last
term
and
i
know
trevor
expects
his
wing
to
so
i
buck
along
and
you
race
up
to
take
my
pass
see
this
was
not
in
line
at
all
he
proposed
a
slight
alteration
in
the
scheme
had
you
better
get
somebody
else
he
began
do
be
a
slack
beast
said
barry
you
want
exercise
awfully
badly
and
as
always
did
exactly
as
barry
wished
he
gave
in
and
spent
from
to
five
that
afternoon
in
the
prescribed
manner
a
suggestion
on
his
part
at
five
sharp
that
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
to
go
and
have
some
tea
was
not
favourably
received
by
the
enthusiastic
who
proposed
to
devote
what
time
remained
before
to
practising
it
was
a
painful
alternative
that
faced
his
allegiance
to
barry
demanded
that
he
should
consent
to
the
scheme
on
the
other
hand
his
allegiance
to
afternoon
tea
equally
strong
called
him
back
to
the
house
where
there
was
cake
and
also
muffins
in
the
end
the
question
was
solved
by
the
appearance
of
drummond
of
seymour
garbed
in
football
things
and
also
anxious
to
practise
so
was
dismissed
to
his
tea
with
opprobrious
epithets
and
barry
and
drummond
settled
down
to
a
little
serious
and
scientific
work
making
allowances
for
the
inevitable
attack
of
nerves
that
attends
a
first
appearance
in
higher
football
circles
than
one
is
accustomed
to
barry
did
well
against
the
scratch
team
certainly
far
better
than
had
done
his
smallness
was
of
course
against
him
and
on
the
only
occasion
on
which
he
really
got
away
paget
overtook
him
and
brought
him
down
but
then
paget
was
exceptionally
fast
in
the
two
most
important
branches
of
the
game
the
taking
of
passes
and
tackling
barry
did
well
as
far
as
pluck
went
he
had
enough
for
two
and
when
the
whistle
blew
for
he
had
not
let
paget
through
once
and
trevor
felt
that
his
inclusion
in
the
team
had
been
justified
there
was
another
scratch
game
on
the
saturday
barry
played
in
it
and
did
much
better
paget
had
gone
away
by
an
early
train
and
the
man
he
had
to
mark
now
was
one
of
the
masters
who
had
been
good
in
his
time
but
was
getting
a
trifle
old
for
football
barry
scored
twice
and
on
one
occasion
by
passing
back
to
trevor
after
the
manner
of
paget
enabled
the
captain
to
run
in
and
trevor
like
the
captain
in
werry
much
approved
of
what
he
done
barry
began
to
be
regarded
in
the
school
as
a
regular
member
of
the
fifteen
the
first
of
the
matches
versus
the
town
was
due
on
the
following
saturday
and
it
was
generally
expected
that
he
would
play
devotion
increased
every
day
he
even
went
to
the
length
of
taking
long
runs
with
him
and
if
there
was
one
thing
in
the
world
that
loathed
it
was
a
long
run
on
the
thursday
before
the
match
against
the
town
clowes
came
chuckling
to
trevor
study
after
preparation
and
asked
him
if
he
had
heard
the
latest
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
league
he
said
trevor
pondered
i
do
think
so
he
replied
how
long
have
you
been
at
the
school
let
see
it
be
five
years
at
the
end
of
the
summer
term
ah
then
you
would
remember
i
been
here
a
couple
of
terms
longer
than
you
and
the
row
about
the
league
was
in
my
first
term
what
was
the
row
oh
only
some
chaps
formed
a
sort
of
secret
society
in
the
place
kind
of
vehmgericht
you
know
if
they
got
their
knife
into
any
one
he
usually
got
beans
and
could
never
find
out
where
they
came
from
at
first
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
thing
was
quite
a
philanthropical
concern
there
used
to
be
a
good
deal
of
bullying
in
the
place
then
at
least
in
some
of
the
houses
and
as
the
prefects
could
or
stop
it
some
fellows
started
this
league
did
it
work
work
by
jove
i
should
think
it
did
chaps
who
previously
get
through
the
day
without
making
some
wretched
kid
life
not
worth
living
used
to
go
about
as
nervous
as
cats
looking
over
their
shoulders
every
other
second
there
was
one
man
in
particular
a
chap
called
leigh
he
was
hauled
out
of
bed
one
night
blindfolded
and
ducked
in
a
cold
bath
he
was
in
the
school
house
why
did
the
league
bust
up
well
partly
because
the
fellows
left
but
chiefly
because
they
stick
to
the
philanthropist
idea
if
anybody
did
anything
they
like
they
used
to
go
for
him
at
last
they
put
their
foot
into
it
badly
a
chap
called
robinson
in
this
house
by
the
way
offended
them
in
some
way
and
one
morning
he
was
found
tied
up
in
the
bath
up
to
his
neck
in
cold
water
apparently
he
been
there
about
an
hour
he
got
pneumonia
and
almost
died
and
then
the
authorities
began
to
get
going
robinson
thought
he
had
recognised
the
voice
of
one
of
the
chaps
i
forget
his
name
the
chap
was
had
up
by
the
old
man
and
gave
the
show
away
entirely
about
a
dozen
fellows
were
sacked
clean
off
the
reel
since
then
the
thing
has
been
dropped
but
what
about
it
what
were
you
going
to
say
when
you
came
in
why
it
been
revived
rot
it
a
fact
do
you
know
mill
a
prefect
in
seymour
only
by
sight
i
met
him
just
now
he
in
a
raving
condition
his
study
been
wrecked
you
never
saw
such
a
sight
everything
upside
down
or
smashed
he
has
been
showing
me
the
ruins
i
believe
mill
is
awfully
barred
in
seymour
said
trevor
anybody
might
have
ragged
his
study
that
just
what
i
thought
he
just
the
sort
of
man
the
league
used
to
go
for
that
does
prove
that
it
been
revived
all
the
same
objected
trevor
no
friend
but
this
does
mill
found
it
tied
to
a
chair
it
was
a
small
card
it
looked
like
an
ordinary
visiting
card
on
it
in
neat
print
were
the
words
the
compliments
of
the
that
exactly
the
same
sort
of
card
as
they
used
to
use
said
clowes
i
seen
some
of
them
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
think
whoever
has
started
the
thing
is
a
pretty
idiot
he
bound
to
get
caught
some
time
or
other
and
then
out
he
goes
the
old
man
would
think
twice
about
sacking
a
chap
of
that
sort
a
chap
of
that
sort
said
clowes
will
take
jolly
good
care
he
caught
but
it
rather
sport
is
it
and
he
went
off
to
his
study
next
day
there
was
further
evidence
that
the
league
was
an
actual
going
concern
when
trevor
came
down
to
breakfast
he
found
a
letter
by
his
plate
it
was
printed
as
the
card
had
been
it
was
signed
the
president
of
the
league
and
the
purport
of
it
was
that
the
league
did
not
wish
barry
to
continue
to
play
for
the
first
fifteen
v
mill
receives
visitors
trevor
first
idea
was
that
somebody
had
sent
the
letter
for
a
joke
clowes
for
choice
he
sounded
him
on
the
subject
after
breakfast
did
you
send
me
that
letter
he
inquired
when
clowes
came
into
his
study
to
borrow
a
what
letter
did
you
send
the
team
for
tomorrow
up
to
the
sporter
i
wonder
what
sort
of
a
lot
the
town
are
bringing
about
not
giving
barry
his
footer
colours
clowes
was
reading
the
paper
giving
whom
he
asked
barry
ca
you
listen
giving
him
what
footer
colours
what
about
them
trevor
sprang
at
the
paper
and
tore
it
away
from
him
after
which
he
sat
on
the
fragments
did
you
send
me
a
letter
about
not
giving
barry
his
footer
colours
clowes
surveyed
him
with
the
air
of
a
nurse
to
whom
the
family
baby
has
just
said
some
more
than
usually
good
thing
do
stop
he
said
i
could
listen
all
day
trevor
felt
in
his
pocket
for
the
note
and
flung
it
at
him
clowes
picked
it
up
and
read
it
gravely
what
footer
colours
he
asked
well
said
trevor
it
a
pretty
rotten
sort
of
joke
whoever
sent
it
you
have
said
yet
whether
you
did
or
not
what
earthly
reason
should
i
have
for
sending
it
and
i
think
making
a
mistake
if
you
think
this
is
meant
as
a
joke
you
do
really
believe
this
league
rot
you
did
see
mill
study
treatment
i
did
anyhow
how
do
you
account
for
the
card
i
showed
you
but
that
sort
of
thing
does
happen
at
school
well
it
happened
you
see
who
do
you
think
did
send
the
letter
then
the
president
of
the
league
and
who
the
dickens
is
the
president
of
the
league
when
he
at
home
if
i
knew
that
i
should
tell
mill
and
earn
his
blessing
not
that
i
want
it
then
i
suppose
snorted
trevor
you
suggest
that
on
the
strength
of
this
letter
i
better
leave
barry
out
of
the
team
satirically
in
brackets
commented
clowes
it
no
good
your
jumping
on
he
added
i
done
nothing
all
i
suggest
is
that
you
better
keep
more
or
less
of
a
if
this
league
anything
like
the
old
one
you
find
they
all
sorts
of
ways
of
getting
at
people
they
do
love
i
should
like
to
come
down
for
a
bath
some
morning
and
find
you
already
in
possession
tied
up
like
robinson
when
they
found
robinson
he
was
quite
blue
both
as
to
the
face
and
speech
he
did
speak
very
clearly
but
what
one
could
catch
was
well
worth
hearing
i
should
advise
you
to
sleep
with
a
loaded
revolver
under
your
pillow
the
first
thing
i
shall
do
is
find
out
who
wrote
this
letter
i
should
said
clowes
encouragingly
keep
moving
in
seymour
house
the
mill
study
incident
formed
the
only
theme
of
conversation
that
morning
previously
the
sudden
elevation
to
the
first
fifteen
of
barry
who
was
popular
in
the
house
at
the
expense
of
who
was
unpopular
had
given
seymour
something
to
talk
about
but
the
ragging
of
the
study
put
this
topic
entirely
in
the
shade
the
study
was
still
on
view
in
almost
its
original
condition
of
disorder
and
all
day
comparative
strangers
flocked
to
see
mill
in
his
den
in
order
to
inspect
things
mill
was
a
youth
with
few
friends
and
it
is
probable
that
more
of
his
crossed
the
threshold
of
his
study
on
the
day
after
the
occurrence
than
had
visited
him
in
the
entire
course
of
his
school
career
brown
would
come
in
to
borrow
a
knife
would
sweep
the
room
with
one
comprehensive
glance
and
depart
to
be
followed
at
brief
intervals
by
smith
robinson
and
jones
who
came
respectively
to
learn
the
right
time
to
borrow
a
book
and
to
ask
him
if
he
had
seen
a
pencil
anywhere
towards
the
end
of
the
day
mill
would
seem
to
have
wearied
somewhat
of
the
proceedings
as
was
proved
when
master
thomas
renford
aged
fourteen
who
fagged
for
milton
the
head
of
the
house
burst
in
on
the
thin
pretence
that
he
had
mistaken
the
study
for
that
of
his
rightful
master
and
gave
vent
to
a
prolonged
whistle
of
surprise
and
satisfaction
at
the
sight
of
the
ruins
on
that
occasion
the
incensed
owner
of
the
dismantled
study
taking
a
mean
advantage
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
prefect
and
so
entitled
to
wield
the
rod
produced
a
handy
from
an
adjacent
corner
and
inviting
master
renford
to
bend
over
gave
him
six
of
the
best
to
remember
him
by
which
ceremony
being
concluded
he
kicked
him
out
into
the
passage
and
renford
went
down
to
the
junior
to
tell
his
friend
harvey
about
it
gave
me
six
the
cad
said
he
just
because
i
had
a
look
at
his
beastly
study
why
should
i
look
at
his
study
if
i
like
i
a
jolly
good
mind
to
go
up
and
have
another
squint
harvey
warmly
approved
the
scheme
no
i
do
think
i
will
said
renford
with
a
yawn
it
such
a
fag
going
upstairs
yes
is
it
said
harvey
and
he
such
a
beast
too
yes
is
he
said
harvey
i
jolly
glad
his
study
been
ragged
continued
the
vindictive
renford
it
jolly
exciting
is
it
added
harvey
and
i
thought
this
term
was
going
to
be
slow
the
easter
term
generally
is
this
remark
seemed
to
suggest
a
train
of
thought
to
renford
who
made
the
following
cryptic
observation
have
you
seen
them
today
to
the
ordinary
person
the
words
would
have
conveyed
little
meaning
to
harvey
they
appeared
to
teem
with
import
yes
he
said
i
saw
them
early
this
morning
were
they
all
right
yes
splendid
good
said
renford
barry
friend
drummond
was
one
of
those
who
had
visited
the
scene
of
the
disaster
early
before
mill
energetic
hand
had
repaired
the
damage
done
and
his
narrative
was
consequently
in
some
demand
the
place
was
in
a
frightful
muck
he
said
everything
smashed
except
the
table
and
ink
all
over
the
place
whoever
did
it
must
have
been
fairly
sick
with
him
or
he
never
have
taken
the
trouble
to
do
it
so
thoroughly
made
a
fair
old
hash
of
things
did
he
bertie
bertie
was
the
form
in
which
the
school
elected
to
serve
up
the
name
of
de
bertini
raoul
de
bertini
was
a
french
boy
who
had
come
to
wrykyn
in
the
previous
term
drummond
father
had
met
his
father
in
paris
and
drummond
was
supposed
to
be
looking
after
bertie
they
shared
a
study
together
bertie
could
not
speak
much
english
and
what
he
did
speak
was
like
mill
furniture
badly
broken
pardon
he
said
does
matter
said
drummond
it
was
anything
important
i
was
only
appealing
to
you
for
corroborative
detail
to
give
artistic
verisimilitude
to
a
bald
and
unconvincing
narrative
bertie
grinned
politely
he
always
grinned
when
he
was
not
quite
equal
to
the
intellectual
pressure
of
the
conversation
as
a
consequence
of
which
he
was
generally
like
mrs
fezziwig
one
vast
substantial
smile
i
never
liked
mill
much
said
barry
but
i
think
it
rather
bad
luck
on
the
man
once
announced
solemnly
he
kicked
me
for
making
a
row
in
the
passage
it
was
plain
that
the
recollection
rankled
barry
would
probably
have
pointed
out
what
an
excellent
and
praiseworthy
act
on
mill
part
that
had
been
when
came
in
prefects
meeting
he
inquired
or
have
they
made
you
a
prefect
yet
said
they
had
not
nobody
present
liked
and
they
looked
at
him
rather
inquiringly
as
if
to
ask
what
he
had
come
for
a
friend
may
drop
in
for
a
chat
an
acquaintance
must
justify
his
intrusion
ignored
the
silent
inquiry
he
seated
himself
on
the
table
and
dragged
up
a
chair
to
rest
his
legs
on
talking
about
mill
of
course
he
said
yes
said
drummond
have
you
seen
his
study
since
it
happened
yes
smiled
as
if
the
recollection
amused
him
he
was
one
of
those
people
who
do
not
look
their
best
when
they
smile
playing
for
the
first
tomorrow
barry
i
do
know
said
barry
shortly
i
have
seen
the
list
he
objected
to
the
introduction
of
the
topic
it
is
never
pleasant
to
have
to
discuss
games
with
the
very
man
one
has
ousted
from
the
team
drummond
too
seemed
to
feel
that
the
situation
was
an
embarrassing
one
for
a
few
minutes
later
he
got
up
to
go
over
to
the
gymnasium
any
of
you
chaps
coming
he
asked
barry
and
thought
they
would
and
the
three
left
the
room
nothing
like
showing
a
man
you
do
want
him
eh
bertie
what
do
you
think
said
bertie
grinned
politely
vi
trevor
remains
firm
the
most
immediate
effect
of
telling
anybody
not
to
do
a
thing
is
to
make
him
do
it
in
order
to
assert
his
independence
trevor
first
act
on
receipt
of
the
letter
was
to
include
barry
in
the
team
against
the
town
it
was
what
he
would
have
done
in
any
case
but
under
the
circumstances
he
felt
a
peculiar
pleasure
in
doing
it
the
incident
also
had
the
effect
of
recalling
to
his
mind
the
fact
that
he
had
tried
barry
in
the
first
instance
on
his
own
responsibility
without
consulting
the
committee
the
committee
of
the
first
fifteen
consisted
of
the
two
old
colours
who
came
immediately
after
the
captain
on
the
list
the
powers
of
a
committee
varied
according
to
the
determination
and
truculence
of
the
members
of
it
on
any
definite
and
important
step
affecting
the
welfare
of
the
fifteen
the
captain
theoretically
could
not
move
without
their
approval
but
if
the
captain
happened
to
be
and
the
committee
weak
they
were
apt
to
be
slightly
out
of
it
and
the
captain
would
develop
a
habit
of
consulting
them
a
day
or
so
after
he
had
done
a
thing
he
would
give
a
man
his
colours
and
inform
the
committee
of
it
on
the
following
afternoon
when
the
thing
was
done
and
could
not
be
repealed
trevor
was
accustomed
to
ask
the
advice
of
his
lieutenants
fairly
frequently
he
never
gave
colours
for
instance
off
his
own
bat
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
learn
what
views
milton
and
allardyce
had
on
the
subject
of
barry
and
after
the
town
team
had
gone
back
across
the
river
defeated
by
a
goal
and
a
try
to
nil
he
changed
and
went
over
to
seymour
to
interview
milton
milton
was
in
an
watching
renford
brew
tea
his
was
one
of
the
few
studies
in
the
school
in
which
there
was
an
with
the
majority
of
his
contemporaries
it
would
only
run
to
the
portable
kind
that
fold
up
come
and
have
some
tea
trevor
said
milton
thanks
if
there
any
going
heaps
is
there
anything
to
eat
renford
the
fag
appealed
to
on
this
important
point
pondered
darkly
for
a
moment
there
some
cake
he
said
that
all
right
interrupted
milton
cheerfully
scratch
the
cake
i
ate
it
before
the
match
is
there
anything
else
milton
had
a
healthy
appetite
then
there
used
to
be
some
biscuits
biscuits
are
off
i
finished
yesterday
look
here
young
renford
what
you
better
do
is
cut
across
to
the
shop
and
get
some
more
cake
and
some
more
biscuits
and
tell
to
put
it
down
to
me
and
do
be
long
a
miles
better
idea
would
be
to
send
him
over
to
donaldson
to
fetch
something
from
my
study
suggested
trevor
it
is
nearly
so
far
and
i
got
heaps
of
stuff
ripping
cut
over
to
donaldson
young
renford
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
added
confidentially
when
the
emissary
had
vanished
i
not
half
sure
that
the
other
dodge
would
have
worked
they
seem
to
think
at
the
shop
that
i
had
about
enough
things
on
tick
lately
i
settled
up
for
last
term
yet
i
spent
all
i
got
on
this
study
what
do
you
think
of
those
photographs
trevor
got
up
and
inspected
them
they
filled
the
mantelpiece
and
most
of
the
wall
above
it
they
were
exclusively
theatrical
photographs
and
of
a
variety
to
suit
all
tastes
for
the
earnest
student
of
the
drama
there
was
sir
henry
irving
in
and
mr
martin
harvey
in
only
for
the
admirers
of
the
merely
beautiful
there
were
messrs
dan
leno
and
herbert
campbell
not
bad
said
trevor
beastly
waste
of
money
waste
of
money
milton
was
surprised
and
pained
at
the
criticism
why
you
must
spend
your
money
on
rot
i
call
it
said
trevor
if
you
want
to
collect
something
why
do
you
collect
something
worth
having
just
then
renford
came
back
with
the
supplies
thanks
said
milton
put
down
does
the
billy
boil
young
renford
renford
asked
for
explanatory
notes
you
a
bit
of
an
ass
at
times
are
you
said
milton
kindly
what
i
meant
was
is
the
tea
ready
if
it
is
you
can
scoot
if
it
is
buck
up
with
it
a
sound
of
bubbling
and
a
rush
of
steam
from
the
spout
of
the
kettle
proclaimed
that
the
billy
did
boil
renford
extinguished
the
etna
and
left
the
room
while
milton
murmuring
vague
formulae
about
one
spoonful
for
each
person
and
one
for
the
pot
got
out
of
his
chair
with
a
groan
for
the
town
match
had
been
an
energetic
one
and
began
to
prepare
tea
what
i
really
came
round
about
began
trevor
half
a
second
i
ca
find
the
milk
he
went
to
the
door
and
shouted
for
renford
on
that
overworked
youth
appearance
the
following
dialogue
took
place
where
the
milk
what
milk
my
milk
there
is
any
this
in
a
tone
not
untinged
with
triumph
as
if
the
speaker
realised
that
here
was
a
distinct
score
to
him
no
milk
no
why
not
you
never
had
any
well
just
cut
across
no
half
a
second
what
are
you
doing
downstairs
having
tea
then
you
got
milk
only
a
little
this
apprehensively
bring
it
up
you
can
have
what
we
leave
disgusted
retirement
of
master
renford
what
i
really
came
about
said
trevor
again
was
business
colours
inquired
milton
rummaging
in
the
tin
for
biscuits
with
sugar
on
them
good
brand
of
biscuit
you
keep
trevor
yes
i
think
we
might
give
alexander
and
parker
their
third
all
right
any
others
barry
his
second
do
you
think
rather
he
played
a
good
game
today
he
an
improvement
on
glad
you
think
so
i
was
wondering
whether
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
chucking
out
after
one
trial
like
that
but
still
if
you
think
barry
better
streets
better
i
had
heaps
of
chances
of
watching
them
and
comparing
them
when
they
been
playing
for
the
house
it
is
only
that
ca
tackle
and
barry
can
barry
takes
his
passes
much
better
and
does
lose
his
head
when
he
pressed
just
what
i
thought
said
trevor
then
you
go
on
playing
him
for
the
first
rather
he
get
better
every
game
you
see
as
he
gets
more
used
to
playing
in
the
first
line
and
he
as
keen
as
anything
on
getting
into
the
team
practises
taking
passes
and
that
sort
of
thing
every
day
well
he
get
his
colours
if
we
lick
ripton
we
ought
to
lick
them
they
lost
one
of
their
forwards
clifford
a
chap
who
was
good
out
of
touch
i
do
know
if
you
remember
him
i
suppose
i
ought
to
go
and
see
allardyce
about
these
colours
now
there
was
running
and
passing
on
the
monday
for
every
one
in
the
three
teams
trevor
and
clowes
met
mr
seymour
as
they
were
returning
mr
seymour
was
the
football
master
at
wrykyn
i
see
you
given
barry
his
second
trevor
yes
sir
i
think
you
wise
to
play
him
for
the
first
he
knows
the
game
which
is
the
great
thing
and
he
will
improve
with
practice
said
mr
seymour
thus
corroborating
milton
words
of
the
previous
saturday
i
glad
seymour
thinks
barry
good
said
trevor
as
they
walked
on
i
shall
go
on
playing
him
now
found
out
who
wrote
that
letter
yet
trevor
laughed
not
yet
he
said
probably
suggested
clowes
he
the
man
who
would
gain
most
by
barry
not
playing
i
hear
he
had
a
row
with
mill
just
before
his
study
was
ragged
everybody
in
seymour
has
had
rows
with
mill
some
time
or
other
said
trevor
clowes
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
junior
to
find
his
fag
trevor
went
on
upstairs
in
the
passage
he
met
ruthven
ruthven
seemed
excited
i
say
trevor
he
exclaimed
have
you
seen
your
study
why
what
the
matter
with
it
you
better
go
and
look
vii
with
the
compliments
of
the
league
trevor
went
and
looked
it
was
rather
an
interesting
sight
an
earthquake
or
a
cyclone
might
have
made
it
a
little
more
picturesque
but
not
much
more
the
general
effect
was
not
unlike
that
of
an
american
saloon
after
a
visit
from
mrs
carrie
nation
with
hatchet
as
in
the
case
of
mill
study
the
only
thing
that
did
not
seem
to
have
suffered
any
great
damage
was
the
table
everything
else
looked
rather
off
colour
the
mantelpiece
had
been
swept
as
bare
as
a
bone
and
its
contents
littered
the
floor
trevor
dived
among
the
debris
and
retrieved
the
latest
addition
to
his
art
gallery
the
photograph
of
this
year
first
fifteen
it
was
a
wreck
the
glass
was
broken
and
the
photograph
itself
slashed
with
a
knife
till
most
of
the
faces
were
unrecognisable
he
picked
up
another
treasure
last
year
first
eleven
smashed
glass
again
faces
cut
about
with
knife
as
before
his
collection
of
snapshots
was
torn
into
a
thousand
fragments
though
as
mr
jerome
said
of
the
trout
there
may
only
have
been
nine
hundred
he
did
not
count
them
his
bookshelf
was
empty
the
books
had
gone
to
swell
the
contents
of
the
floor
there
was
a
shakespeare
with
its
cover
off
pages
to
of
had
parted
from
the
parent
establishment
and
were
lying
by
themselves
near
the
door
rogues
lay
just
beyond
them
and
the
look
of
the
cover
suggested
that
somebody
had
either
been
biting
it
or
jumping
on
it
with
heavy
boots
there
was
other
damage
over
the
mantelpiece
in
happier
days
had
hung
a
dozen
sea
gulls
eggs
threaded
on
a
string
the
string
was
still
there
as
good
as
new
but
of
the
eggs
nothing
was
to
be
seen
save
a
fine
powder
on
the
floor
like
everything
else
in
the
study
and
a
good
deal
of
ink
had
been
upset
in
one
place
and
another
trevor
had
been
staring
at
the
ruins
for
some
time
when
he
looked
up
to
see
clowes
standing
in
the
doorway
hullo
said
clowes
been
tidying
up
trevor
made
a
few
hasty
comments
on
the
situation
clowes
listened
approvingly
do
you
think
he
went
on
eyeing
the
study
with
a
critical
air
that
you
got
too
many
things
on
the
floor
and
too
few
anywhere
else
and
i
should
move
some
of
those
books
on
to
the
shelf
if
i
were
you
trevor
breathed
very
hard
i
should
like
to
find
the
chap
who
did
this
he
said
softly
clowes
advanced
into
the
room
and
proceeded
to
pick
up
various
misplaced
articles
of
furniture
in
a
helpful
way
i
thought
so
he
said
presently
come
and
look
here
tied
to
a
chair
exactly
as
it
had
been
in
the
case
of
mill
was
a
neat
white
card
and
on
it
were
the
words
with
the
compliments
of
the
league
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
this
asked
clowes
come
into
my
room
and
talk
it
over
i
tidy
this
place
up
first
said
trevor
he
felt
that
the
work
would
be
a
relief
i
do
want
people
to
see
this
it
must
get
about
i
not
going
to
have
my
study
turned
into
a
sort
of
like
mill
you
go
and
change
i
sha
be
long
i
will
never
desert
mr
micawber
said
clowes
friend
my
place
is
by
your
side
shut
the
door
and
let
get
to
work
ten
minutes
later
the
room
had
resumed
a
more
or
less
though
principally
less
normal
appearance
the
books
and
chairs
were
back
in
their
places
the
ink
was
sopped
up
the
broken
photographs
were
stacked
in
a
neat
pile
in
one
corner
with
a
rug
over
them
the
mantelpiece
was
still
empty
but
as
clowes
pointed
out
it
now
merely
looked
as
if
trevor
had
been
pawning
some
of
his
household
gods
there
was
no
sign
that
a
devastating
secret
society
had
raged
through
the
study
then
they
adjourned
to
clowes
study
where
trevor
sank
into
chair
clowes
by
an
adroit
movement
having
appropriated
the
best
one
with
a
sigh
of
enjoyment
running
and
passing
followed
by
the
toil
of
had
made
him
feel
quite
tired
it
does
look
so
bad
now
he
said
thinking
of
the
room
they
had
left
by
the
way
what
did
you
do
with
that
card
here
it
is
want
it
you
can
keep
it
i
do
want
it
thanks
if
this
sort
of
things
goes
on
i
shall
get
quite
a
nice
collection
of
these
cards
start
an
album
some
day
you
know
said
trevor
this
is
getting
serious
it
always
does
get
serious
when
anything
bad
happens
to
one
self
it
always
strikes
one
as
rather
funny
when
things
happen
to
other
people
when
mill
study
was
wrecked
i
bet
you
regarded
it
as
an
amusing
and
original
what
do
you
think
of
the
present
effort
who
on
earth
can
have
done
it
the
pres
oh
dry
up
of
course
it
was
but
who
the
blazes
is
he
nay
children
you
have
me
there
quoted
clowes
i
tell
you
one
thing
though
you
remember
what
i
said
about
it
probably
being
he
ca
have
done
this
that
certain
because
he
was
out
in
the
fields
the
whole
time
though
i
do
see
who
else
could
have
anything
to
gain
by
barry
not
getting
his
colours
there
no
reason
to
suspect
him
at
all
as
far
as
i
can
see
i
know
much
about
him
bar
the
fact
that
he
ca
play
footer
for
nuts
but
i
never
heard
anything
against
him
have
you
i
scarcely
know
him
myself
he
is
liked
in
seymour
i
believe
well
anyhow
this
ca
be
his
work
that
what
i
said
for
all
we
know
the
league
may
have
got
their
knife
into
barry
for
some
reason
you
said
they
used
to
get
their
knife
into
fellows
in
that
way
anyhow
i
mean
to
find
out
who
ragged
my
room
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
said
clowes
came
round
to
donaldson
before
morning
school
next
day
to
tell
trevor
that
he
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
finding
the
lost
bat
he
found
trevor
and
clowes
in
the
former
den
trying
to
put
a
few
finishing
touches
to
the
same
hullo
an
what
up
with
your
study
he
inquired
he
was
quick
at
noticing
things
trevor
looked
annoyed
clowes
asked
the
visitor
if
he
did
not
think
the
study
presented
a
neat
and
gentlemanly
appearance
where
are
all
your
photographs
trevor
persisted
the
descendant
of
irish
kings
it
no
good
trying
to
conceal
anything
from
the
bhoy
said
clowes
sit
down
mind
that
chair
it
rather
wobbly
and
i
will
tell
ye
the
story
can
you
keep
a
thing
dark
inquired
trevor
protested
that
tombs
were
not
in
it
well
then
do
you
remember
what
happened
to
mill
study
what
been
going
on
here
nearly
fell
off
his
chair
with
surprise
that
some
philanthropist
should
rag
mill
study
was
only
to
be
expected
mill
was
one
of
the
worst
a
worm
without
a
saving
grace
but
trevor
captain
of
football
in
the
first
eleven
the
thing
was
unthinkable
but
who
he
began
that
just
what
i
want
to
know
said
trevor
shortly
he
did
not
enjoy
discussing
the
affair
how
long
have
you
been
at
wrykyn
said
clowes
made
a
rapid
calculation
his
fingers
twiddled
in
the
air
as
he
worked
out
the
problem
six
years
he
said
at
last
leaning
back
exhausted
with
brain
work
then
you
must
remember
the
league
remember
the
league
rather
well
it
been
revived
whistled
this
liven
the
old
place
up
he
said
i
often
thought
of
reviving
it
meself
an
so
has
moriarty
if
it
anything
like
the
old
league
there
going
to
be
a
sort
of
donnybrook
before
it
done
with
i
wonder
who
running
it
this
time
we
should
like
to
know
that
if
you
find
out
you
might
tell
us
i
will
and
do
tell
anybody
else
said
trevor
this
business
has
got
to
be
kept
quiet
keep
it
dark
about
my
study
having
been
ragged
i
wo
tell
a
soul
not
even
moriarty
oh
hang
it
man
put
in
clowes
you
do
want
to
kill
the
poor
bhoy
surely
you
must
let
him
tell
one
person
all
right
said
trevor
you
can
tell
moriarty
but
nobody
else
mind
promised
that
moriarty
should
receive
the
news
exclusively
but
why
did
the
league
go
for
ye
they
happen
to
be
down
on
me
it
does
matter
why
they
are
i
see
said
oh
he
added
about
that
bat
the
search
is
being
prosecuted
that
a
newspaper
quotation
times
inquired
clowes
said
pulling
out
a
bundle
of
letters
he
inspected
each
envelope
in
turn
and
from
the
fifth
extracted
a
newspaper
cutting
read
that
he
said
it
was
from
the
local
paper
and
ran
as
follows
a
painful
sensation
has
been
caused
in
the
town
by
a
deplorable
ebullition
of
local
hooliganism
which
has
resulted
in
the
wanton
disfigurement
of
the
splendid
statue
of
sir
eustace
briggs
which
stands
in
the
new
recreation
grounds
our
readers
will
recollect
that
the
statue
was
erected
to
commemorate
the
return
of
sir
eustace
as
member
for
the
borough
of
wrykyn
by
an
overwhelming
majority
at
the
last
election
last
tuesday
some
youths
of
the
town
passing
through
the
recreation
grounds
early
in
the
morning
noticed
that
the
face
and
body
of
the
statue
were
completely
covered
with
leaves
and
some
black
substance
which
on
examination
proved
to
be
tar
they
speedily
lodged
information
at
the
police
station
everything
seems
to
point
to
party
spite
as
the
motive
for
the
outrage
in
view
of
the
election
such
an
act
is
highly
significant
and
will
serve
sufficiently
to
indicate
the
tactics
employed
by
our
opponents
the
search
for
the
perpetrator
or
perpetrators
of
the
dastardly
act
is
being
vigorously
prosecuted
and
we
learn
with
satisfaction
that
the
police
have
already
several
clues
clues
said
clowes
handing
back
the
paper
that
means
that
gas
about
opponents
is
all
a
blind
to
put
you
off
your
guard
you
wait
there
be
more
painful
sensations
before
finished
with
this
business
they
ca
have
found
the
bat
or
why
did
they
not
say
so
observed
guile
said
clowes
pure
guile
if
i
were
you
i
should
escape
while
i
could
try
callao
there
no
extradition
there
no
petition
is
extradition
allowed
in
callao
either
of
you
chaps
coming
over
to
school
viii
on
the
track
tuesday
mornings
at
wrykyn
were
devoted
up
to
the
quarter
to
eleven
interval
to
the
study
of
mathematics
that
is
to
say
instead
of
going
to
their
the
various
forms
visited
the
nooks
and
dens
at
the
top
of
the
buildings
where
the
mathematical
masters
were
wont
to
lurk
and
spent
a
pleasant
two
hours
there
playing
round
games
or
reading
fiction
under
the
desk
mathematics
being
one
of
the
few
branches
of
school
learning
which
are
of
any
use
in
after
life
nobody
ever
dreamed
of
doing
any
work
in
that
direction
least
of
all
it
was
a
theory
of
that
he
came
to
school
to
enjoy
himself
to
have
done
any
work
during
a
mathematics
lesson
would
have
struck
him
as
a
positive
waste
of
time
especially
as
he
was
in
mr
banks
class
mr
banks
was
a
master
who
simply
cried
out
to
be
ragged
everything
he
did
and
said
seemed
to
invite
the
members
of
his
class
to
amuse
themselves
and
they
amused
themselves
accordingly
one
of
the
advantages
of
being
under
him
was
that
it
was
possible
to
predict
to
a
nicety
the
moment
when
one
would
be
sent
out
of
the
room
this
was
found
very
convenient
ally
moriarty
was
accustomed
to
take
his
mathematics
with
mr
morgan
whose
room
was
directly
opposite
mr
banks
with
mr
morgan
it
was
not
quite
so
easy
to
date
one
expulsion
from
the
room
under
ordinary
circumstances
and
in
the
normal
wear
and
tear
of
the
morning
work
but
there
was
one
particular
action
which
could
always
be
relied
upon
to
produce
the
desired
result
in
one
corner
of
the
room
stood
a
gigantic
globe
the
problem
how
did
it
get
into
the
room
was
one
that
had
exercised
the
minds
of
many
generations
of
wrykinians
it
was
much
too
big
to
have
come
through
the
door
some
thought
that
the
block
had
been
built
round
it
others
that
it
had
been
placed
in
the
room
in
infancy
and
had
since
grown
to
refer
the
question
to
mr
morgan
would
in
six
cases
out
of
ten
mean
instant
departure
from
the
room
but
to
make
the
event
certain
it
was
necessary
to
grasp
the
globe
firmly
and
spin
it
round
on
its
axis
that
always
proved
successful
mr
morgan
would
dash
down
from
his
dais
address
the
offender
in
spirited
terms
and
give
him
his
marching
orders
at
once
and
without
further
trouble
moriarty
had
arranged
with
to
set
the
globe
rolling
at
ten
sharp
on
this
particular
morning
would
then
so
arrange
matters
with
mr
banks
that
they
could
meet
in
the
passage
at
that
hour
when
wished
to
impart
to
his
friend
his
information
concerning
the
league
promised
to
be
at
the
at
the
hour
mentioned
he
did
not
think
there
would
be
any
difficulty
about
it
the
news
that
the
league
had
been
revived
meant
that
there
would
be
trouble
in
the
very
near
future
and
the
prospect
of
trouble
was
meat
and
drink
to
the
irishman
in
consequently
he
felt
in
particularly
good
form
for
mathematics
as
he
interpreted
the
word
he
thought
that
he
would
have
no
difficulty
whatever
in
keeping
mr
banks
bright
and
amused
the
first
step
had
to
be
to
arouse
in
him
an
interest
in
life
to
bring
him
into
a
frame
of
mind
which
would
induce
him
to
look
severely
rather
than
leniently
on
the
next
offender
this
was
effected
as
follows
it
was
mr
banks
practice
to
set
his
class
sums
to
work
out
and
after
some
of
an
hour
had
elapsed
to
pass
round
the
form
what
he
called
solutions
these
were
large
sheets
of
paper
on
which
he
had
worked
out
each
sum
in
his
neat
handwriting
to
a
happy
ending
when
the
head
of
the
form
to
whom
they
were
passed
first
had
finished
with
them
he
would
make
a
slight
tear
in
one
corner
and
having
done
so
hand
them
on
to
his
neighbour
the
neighbour
before
giving
them
to
neighbour
would
also
tear
them
slightly
in
time
they
would
return
to
their
patentee
and
proprietor
and
it
was
then
that
things
became
exciting
who
tore
these
solutions
like
this
asked
mr
banks
in
the
repressed
voice
of
one
who
is
determined
that
he
be
calm
no
answer
the
tattered
solutions
waved
in
the
air
he
turned
to
harringay
the
head
of
the
form
harringay
did
you
tear
these
solutions
like
this
indignant
negative
from
harringay
what
he
had
done
had
been
to
make
the
small
tear
in
the
top
corner
if
mr
banks
had
asked
did
you
make
this
small
tear
in
the
top
corner
of
these
solutions
harringay
would
have
scorned
to
deny
the
impeachment
but
to
claim
the
credit
for
the
whole
work
would
he
felt
be
an
act
of
flat
dishonesty
and
an
injustice
to
his
gifted
no
sir
said
harringay
browne
yes
sir
did
you
tear
these
solutions
in
this
manner
no
sir
and
so
on
through
the
form
then
harringay
rose
after
the
manner
of
the
debater
who
is
conscious
that
he
is
going
to
say
the
popular
thing
sir
he
began
sit
down
harringay
harringay
gracefully
waved
aside
the
absurd
command
sir
he
said
i
think
i
am
expressing
the
general
consensus
of
opinion
among
my
ahem
when
i
say
that
this
class
sincerely
regrets
the
unfortunate
state
the
solutions
have
managed
to
get
themselves
into
hear
hear
from
a
back
bench
it
is
with
sit
harringay
it
is
with
heartfelt
harringay
if
you
do
not
sit
down
as
your
ludship
pleases
this
and
harringay
resumed
his
seat
amidst
applause
got
up
as
me
frind
who
has
just
sat
down
was
about
to
observe
sit
down
the
whole
form
will
remain
after
the
class
the
unfortunate
state
the
solutions
have
managed
to
get
thimsilves
into
is
sincerely
regretted
by
this
class
sir
i
think
i
am
ixprissing
the
general
consensus
of
opinion
among
my
whin
i
say
that
it
is
with
sorrow
yes
sir
leave
the
room
instantly
yes
sir
from
the
tower
across
the
gravel
came
the
melodious
sound
of
chimes
the
college
clock
was
beginning
to
strike
ten
he
had
scarcely
got
into
the
passage
and
closed
the
door
after
him
when
a
roar
as
of
a
bereaved
spirit
rang
through
the
room
opposite
followed
by
a
string
of
words
the
only
intelligible
one
being
the
globe
and
the
next
moment
the
door
opened
and
moriarty
came
out
the
last
stroke
of
ten
was
just
booming
from
the
clock
there
was
a
large
cupboard
in
the
passage
the
top
of
which
made
a
very
comfortable
seat
they
climbed
on
to
this
and
began
to
talk
business
an
what
was
it
ye
wanted
to
tell
me
inquired
moriarty
related
what
he
had
learned
from
trevor
that
morning
an
do
ye
know
said
moriarty
when
he
had
finished
i
half
suspected
when
i
heard
that
mill
study
had
been
ragged
that
it
might
be
the
league
that
had
done
it
if
ye
remember
it
was
what
they
enjoyed
doing
breaking
up
a
man
happy
home
they
did
it
frequently
but
i
ca
understand
them
doing
it
to
trevor
at
all
they
do
it
to
anybody
they
choose
till
they
caught
at
it
if
they
are
caught
there
be
a
row
we
must
catch
said
moriarty
like
he
revelled
in
the
prospect
of
a
disturbance
and
he
were
going
up
to
aldershot
at
the
end
of
the
term
to
try
and
bring
back
the
light
and
medals
respectively
moriarty
had
won
the
in
the
previous
year
but
by
reason
of
putting
on
a
stone
since
the
competition
was
now
no
longer
eligible
for
that
class
had
not
been
up
before
but
the
wrykyn
instructor
a
good
judge
of
pugilistic
form
was
of
opinion
that
he
ought
to
stand
an
excellent
chance
as
the
in
says
when
you
get
a
good
irishman
you
better
but
they
dreadful
was
attending
the
gymnasium
every
night
in
order
to
learn
to
curb
his
dreadful
and
acquire
skill
in
its
place
i
wonder
if
trevor
would
be
any
good
in
a
row
said
moriarty
he
ca
box
said
but
he
go
on
till
he
was
killed
entirely
i
say
i
getting
rather
tired
of
sitting
here
are
you
let
go
to
the
other
end
of
the
passage
and
have
some
cricket
so
having
unearthed
a
piece
of
wood
from
the
debris
at
the
top
of
the
cupboard
and
rolled
a
handkerchief
into
a
ball
they
adjourned
recalling
the
stirring
events
of
six
years
back
when
the
league
had
first
been
started
remembered
that
the
members
of
that
enterprising
society
had
been
wont
to
hold
meetings
in
a
secluded
spot
where
it
was
unlikely
that
they
would
be
disturbed
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
first
thing
he
ought
to
do
if
he
wanted
to
make
their
nearer
acquaintance
now
was
to
find
their
present
rendezvous
they
must
have
one
they
would
never
run
the
risk
involved
in
holding
in
one
another
studies
on
the
last
occasion
it
had
been
an
old
quarry
away
out
on
the
downs
this
had
been
proved
by
the
testimony
of
three
fags
who
had
wandered
out
one
with
the
unconcealed
intention
of
finding
the
place
of
meeting
unfortunately
for
them
they
found
it
they
were
going
down
the
path
that
led
to
the
quarry
when
they
were
unexpectedly
seized
blindfolded
and
carried
off
an
impromptu
was
held
in
whispers
and
the
three
explorers
forthwith
received
the
most
spirited
they
had
ever
experienced
afterwards
they
were
released
and
returned
to
their
house
with
their
zeal
for
detection
quite
quenched
the
episode
had
created
a
good
deal
of
excitement
in
the
school
at
the
time
on
three
successive
afternoons
and
moriarty
scoured
the
downs
and
on
each
occasion
they
drew
blank
on
the
fourth
day
just
before
who
had
been
to
tea
with
gregson
of
day
was
going
over
to
the
gymnasium
to
keep
a
pugilistic
appointment
with
moriarty
when
somebody
ran
swiftly
past
him
in
the
direction
of
the
it
was
almost
dark
for
the
days
were
still
short
and
he
did
not
recognise
the
runner
but
it
puzzled
him
a
little
to
think
where
he
had
sprung
from
was
walking
quite
close
to
the
wall
of
the
college
buildings
and
the
runner
had
passed
between
it
and
him
and
he
had
not
heard
his
footsteps
then
he
understood
and
his
pulse
quickened
as
he
felt
that
he
was
on
the
track
beneath
the
block
was
a
large
sort
of
it
was
used
as
a
for
chairs
and
was
never
opened
except
when
or
some
similar
event
occurred
when
the
chairs
were
needed
it
was
supposed
to
be
locked
at
other
times
but
never
was
the
door
was
just
by
the
spot
where
he
was
standing
as
he
stood
there
other
vague
forms
dashed
past
him
in
a
knot
one
of
them
almost
brushed
against
him
for
a
moment
he
thought
of
stopping
him
but
decided
not
to
he
could
wait
on
the
following
afternoon
he
slipped
down
into
the
basement
soon
after
school
it
was
as
black
as
pitch
in
the
cellar
he
took
up
a
position
near
the
door
it
seemed
hours
before
anything
happened
he
was
indeed
almost
giving
up
the
thing
as
a
bad
job
when
a
ray
of
light
cut
through
the
blackness
in
front
of
him
and
somebody
slipped
through
the
door
the
next
moment
a
second
form
appeared
dimly
and
then
the
light
was
shut
off
again
could
hear
them
groping
their
way
past
him
he
waited
no
longer
it
is
difficult
to
tell
where
sound
comes
from
in
the
dark
he
plunged
forward
at
a
venture
his
hand
swinging
round
in
a
semicircle
met
something
which
felt
like
a
shoulder
he
slipped
his
grasp
down
to
the
arm
and
clutched
it
with
all
the
force
at
his
disposal
ix
mainly
about
ferrets
ow
exclaimed
the
captive
with
no
uncertain
voice
let
go
you
ass
you
hurting
the
voice
was
a
treble
voice
this
surprised
it
looked
very
much
as
if
he
had
put
up
the
wrong
bird
from
the
dimensions
of
the
arm
which
he
was
holding
his
prisoner
seemed
to
be
of
tender
years
let
go
harvey
you
idiot
i
shall
kick
before
the
threat
could
be
put
into
execution
who
had
been
fumbling
all
this
while
in
his
pocket
for
a
match
found
one
loose
and
struck
a
light
the
features
of
the
owner
of
the
arm
he
was
still
holding
it
were
lit
up
for
a
moment
why
it
young
renford
he
exclaimed
what
are
you
doing
down
here
renford
however
continued
to
pursue
the
topic
of
his
arm
and
the
effect
that
the
grip
of
the
irishman
had
had
upon
it
you
nearly
broken
it
he
said
complainingly
i
sorry
i
mistook
you
for
somebody
else
who
that
with
you
it
me
said
an
ungrammatical
voice
who
me
harvey
at
this
point
a
soft
yellow
light
lit
up
the
more
immediate
neighbourhood
harvey
had
brought
a
bicycle
lamp
into
action
that
more
like
it
said
renford
look
here
you
split
will
you
i
not
an
informer
by
profession
thanks
said
oh
i
know
it
all
right
really
but
you
ca
be
too
careful
because
one
is
allowed
down
here
and
there
be
a
beastly
row
if
it
got
out
about
our
being
down
here
and
would
be
cobbed
put
in
harvey
who
are
they
asked
ferrets
like
to
have
a
look
at
them
yes
harvey
brought
back
a
couple
at
the
beginning
of
term
ripping
little
beasts
we
could
keep
them
in
the
house
as
they
have
got
dropped
on
in
a
second
so
we
had
to
think
of
somewhere
else
and
thought
why
not
keep
them
down
here
why
indeed
said
do
ye
find
they
like
it
oh
do
mind
said
harvey
we
feed
twice
a
day
once
before
breakfast
we
take
it
in
turns
to
get
up
early
and
once
directly
after
school
and
on
and
sundays
we
take
them
out
on
to
the
downs
what
for
why
rabbits
of
course
renford
brought
back
a
with
him
we
keep
it
locked
up
in
a
box
do
tell
any
one
and
what
do
ye
do
with
the
rabbits
we
pot
at
them
as
they
come
out
of
the
holes
yes
but
when
ye
hit
oh
said
renford
with
some
reluctance
we
have
exactly
hit
any
yet
we
got
jolly
near
though
lots
of
times
said
harvey
last
saturday
i
swear
i
was
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
inch
off
one
of
them
if
it
had
been
a
rabbit
i
should
have
plugged
it
middle
stump
only
it
was
a
small
one
so
i
missed
but
come
and
see
them
we
keep
right
at
the
other
end
of
the
place
in
case
anybody
comes
in
have
you
ever
seen
anybody
down
here
asked
once
said
renford
chaps
came
down
here
once
while
we
were
feeding
the
ferrets
we
waited
till
they
got
well
in
then
we
nipped
out
quietly
they
did
see
us
did
you
see
who
they
were
no
it
was
too
dark
here
they
are
rummy
old
crib
this
is
it
look
out
for
your
shins
on
the
chairs
switch
on
the
light
harvey
there
are
they
rippers
quite
tame
too
they
know
us
quite
well
they
know
they
going
to
be
fed
too
hullo
sir
nigel
this
is
sir
nigel
out
of
the
company
you
know
do
let
him
nip
your
fingers
this
other
one
sherlock
holmes
s
said
he
had
a
sort
of
idea
that
that
was
the
right
thing
to
say
to
any
animal
that
could
chase
and
bite
renford
was
delighted
to
be
able
to
show
his
ferrets
off
to
so
distinguished
a
visitor
what
were
you
down
here
about
inquired
harvey
when
the
little
animals
had
had
their
meal
and
had
retired
once
more
into
private
life
had
expected
this
question
but
he
did
not
quite
know
what
answer
to
give
perhaps
on
the
whole
he
thought
it
would
be
best
to
tell
them
the
real
reason
if
he
refused
to
explain
their
curiosity
would
be
roused
which
would
be
fatal
and
to
give
any
reason
except
the
true
one
called
for
a
display
of
impromptu
invention
of
which
he
was
not
capable
besides
they
would
not
be
likely
to
give
away
his
secret
while
he
held
this
one
of
theirs
connected
with
the
ferrets
he
explained
the
situation
briefly
and
swore
them
to
silence
on
the
subject
renford
comment
was
brief
by
jove
he
observed
harvey
went
more
deeply
into
the
question
what
makes
you
think
they
meet
down
here
he
asked
i
saw
some
fellows
cutting
out
of
here
last
night
and
you
say
seen
them
here
too
i
do
see
what
object
they
could
have
down
here
if
they
were
the
league
holding
a
meeting
i
do
see
what
else
a
chap
would
be
after
he
might
be
keeping
ferrets
hazarded
renford
the
whole
school
does
keep
ferrets
said
you
unique
in
that
way
no
it
must
be
the
league
an
i
mean
to
wait
here
till
they
come
not
all
night
asked
harvey
he
had
a
great
respect
for
whose
reputation
in
the
school
for
doings
was
considerable
in
the
bright
lexicon
of
he
believed
there
to
be
no
such
word
as
impossible
no
said
but
till
you
two
had
better
cut
now
yes
i
think
we
better
said
harvey
and
do
ye
breathe
a
word
about
this
to
a
soul
a
warning
which
extracted
fervent
promises
of
silence
from
both
youths
this
said
harvey
as
they
emerged
on
to
the
gravel
is
something
like
i
jolly
glad
we
in
it
rather
do
you
think
will
catch
them
he
must
if
he
waits
down
there
long
enough
they
certain
to
come
again
do
you
wish
you
been
here
when
the
league
was
on
before
i
should
think
i
did
race
you
over
to
the
shop
i
want
to
get
something
before
it
shuts
right
ho
and
they
disappeared
waited
where
he
was
till
six
struck
from
the
followed
by
the
sound
of
the
bell
as
it
rang
for
then
he
picked
his
way
carefully
through
the
groves
of
chairs
barking
his
shins
now
and
then
on
their
legs
and
pushing
open
the
door
went
out
into
the
open
air
it
felt
very
fresh
and
pleasant
after
the
brand
of
atmosphere
supplied
in
the
vault
he
then
ran
over
to
the
gymnasium
to
meet
moriarty
feeling
a
little
disgusted
at
the
lack
of
success
that
had
attended
his
detective
efforts
up
to
the
present
so
far
he
had
nothing
to
show
for
his
trouble
except
a
good
deal
of
dust
on
his
clothes
and
a
dirty
collar
but
he
was
full
of
determination
he
could
play
a
waiting
game
it
was
a
pity
as
it
happened
that
left
the
vault
when
he
did
five
minutes
after
he
had
gone
six
shadowy
forms
made
their
way
silently
and
in
single
file
through
the
doorway
of
the
vault
which
they
closed
carefully
behind
them
the
fact
that
it
was
after
was
of
small
consequence
a
good
deal
of
latitude
in
that
way
was
allowed
at
wrykyn
it
was
the
custom
to
go
out
after
the
bell
had
sounded
to
visit
the
gymnasium
in
the
winter
and
easter
terms
the
gymnasium
became
a
sort
of
social
club
people
went
there
with
a
very
small
intention
of
doing
gymnastics
they
went
to
lounge
about
talking
to
cronies
in
front
of
the
two
huge
stoves
which
warmed
the
place
occasionally
as
a
concession
to
the
look
of
the
thing
they
would
do
an
easy
exercise
or
two
on
the
horse
or
parallels
but
for
the
most
part
they
preferred
the
of
spectator
there
was
plenty
to
see
in
one
corner
and
moriarty
would
be
sparring
their
nightly
six
rounds
in
two
batches
of
three
rounds
each
in
another
drummond
who
was
going
up
to
aldershot
as
a
would
be
putting
in
a
little
practice
with
the
instructor
on
the
apparatus
the
members
of
the
gymnastic
six
including
the
two
experts
who
were
to
carry
the
school
colours
to
aldershot
in
the
spring
would
be
performing
their
usual
marvels
it
was
worth
dropping
into
the
gymnasium
of
an
evening
in
no
other
place
in
the
school
were
so
many
sights
to
be
seen
when
you
were
surfeited
with
sightseeing
you
went
off
to
your
house
and
this
was
where
the
peculiar
beauty
of
the
gymnasium
system
came
in
you
went
up
to
any
master
who
happened
to
be
there
there
was
always
one
at
least
and
observed
in
suave
accents
please
sir
can
i
have
a
paper
whereupon
he
taking
a
scrap
of
paper
would
write
upon
it
jones
or
a
smith
or
robinson
left
gymnasium
at
a
time
and
by
presenting
this
to
the
menial
who
opened
the
door
to
you
at
your
house
you
went
in
rejoicing
and
all
was
peace
now
there
was
no
mention
on
the
paper
of
the
hour
at
which
you
came
to
the
gymnasium
only
of
the
hour
at
which
you
left
consequently
certain
lawless
spirits
would
range
the
neighbourhood
after
and
by
putting
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
the
gymnasium
before
returning
to
their
houses
escape
comment
to
this
class
belonged
the
shadowy
forms
previously
mentioned
had
forgotten
this
custom
with
the
result
that
he
was
not
at
the
vault
when
they
arrived
moriarty
to
whom
he
confided
between
the
rounds
the
substance
of
his
evening
discoveries
reminded
him
of
it
it
no
good
watching
before
he
said
after
six
is
the
time
they
come
if
they
come
at
all
bedad
ye
right
said
one
of
these
nights
we
take
a
night
off
from
boxing
and
go
and
watch
right
said
moriarty
are
ye
ready
to
go
on
yes
i
going
to
practise
that
left
swing
at
the
body
this
round
the
one
fitzsimmons
does
and
they
put
up
once
more
x
being
a
chapter
of
accidents
on
the
evening
following
adventure
in
the
vaults
barry
and
were
in
their
study
getting
out
the
most
wrykinians
brewed
in
the
winter
and
easter
terms
when
the
days
were
short
and
early
in
the
summer
term
there
were
other
things
to
do
nets
which
lasted
till
a
quarter
to
seven
when
was
and
the
baths
and
brewing
practically
ceased
but
just
now
it
was
at
its
height
and
every
evening
at
a
quarter
past
five
there
might
be
heard
in
the
houses
the
sizzling
of
the
succulent
sausage
and
other
rare
delicacies
as
a
rule
one
or
two
studies
would
club
together
to
brew
instead
of
preparing
solitary
banquets
this
was
found
both
more
convivial
and
more
economical
at
seymour
studies
numbers
five
six
and
seven
had
always
combined
from
time
immemorial
and
barry
on
obtaining
study
six
had
carried
on
the
tradition
in
study
five
were
drummond
and
his
friend
de
bertini
in
study
seven
which
was
a
smaller
room
and
only
capable
of
holding
one
person
with
any
comfort
one
james
rupert
that
was
his
singular
name
as
mr
gilbert
has
it
had
taken
up
his
abode
the
name
of
having
proved
at
an
early
date
in
his
career
too
great
a
mouthful
for
wrykyn
he
was
known
to
his
friends
and
acquaintances
by
the
euphonious
title
of
shoeblossom
the
charm
about
the
genial
shoeblossom
was
that
you
could
never
tell
what
he
was
going
to
do
next
all
that
you
could
rely
on
with
any
certainty
was
that
it
would
be
something
which
would
have
been
better
left
undone
it
was
just
five
when
barry
and
started
to
get
things
ready
they
were
not
high
enough
up
in
the
school
to
have
fags
so
that
they
had
to
do
this
for
themselves
barry
was
still
in
football
clothes
he
had
been
out
running
and
passing
with
the
first
fifteen
whose
idea
of
exercise
was
winding
up
a
watch
had
been
spending
his
time
since
school
ceased
in
the
study
with
a
book
he
was
in
his
ordinary
clothes
it
was
therefore
fortunate
that
when
he
upset
the
kettle
he
nearly
always
did
at
some
period
of
the
evening
business
the
contents
spread
themselves
over
barry
and
not
over
himself
football
clothes
will
stand
any
amount
of
water
whereas
youth
winter
suiting
at
shillings
and
sixpence
might
have
been
injured
barry
however
did
not
look
upon
the
episode
in
this
philosophical
light
he
spoke
to
him
eloquently
for
a
while
and
then
sent
him
downstairs
to
fetch
more
water
while
he
was
away
drummond
and
de
bertini
came
in
hullo
said
drummond
tea
ready
not
much
replied
barry
bitterly
not
likely
to
be
either
at
this
rate
we
just
got
the
kettle
going
when
that
ass
plunged
against
the
table
and
upset
the
lot
over
my
bags
lucky
the
beastly
stuff
was
boiling
i
soaked
while
we
wait
the
sausages
yes
a
good
idea
he
is
downstairs
but
to
wait
no
no
let
us
shall
we
is
it
not
so
yes
observed
bertie
lucidly
now
construe
said
barry
looking
at
the
linguist
with
a
bewildered
expression
it
was
a
source
of
no
little
inconvenience
to
his
friends
that
de
bertini
was
so
very
fixed
in
his
determination
to
speak
english
he
was
a
trier
all
the
way
was
de
bertini
you
rarely
caught
him
helping
out
his
remarks
with
the
language
of
his
native
land
it
was
english
or
nothing
with
him
to
most
of
his
circle
it
might
as
well
have
been
zulu
drummond
either
through
natural
genius
or
because
he
spent
more
time
with
him
was
generally
able
to
act
as
interpreter
occasionally
there
would
come
a
linguistic
effort
by
which
even
he
freely
confessed
himself
baffled
and
then
they
would
pass
on
unsatisfied
but
as
a
rule
he
was
equal
to
the
emergency
he
was
so
now
what
bertie
means
he
explained
is
that
it
no
good
us
waiting
for
to
come
back
he
never
could
fill
a
kettle
in
less
than
ten
minutes
and
even
then
he
certain
to
spill
it
coming
upstairs
and
have
to
go
back
again
let
get
on
with
the
sausages
the
pan
had
just
been
placed
on
the
fire
when
returned
with
the
water
he
tripped
over
the
mat
as
he
entered
and
spilt
about
half
a
pint
into
one
of
his
football
boots
which
stood
inside
the
door
but
the
accident
was
comparatively
trivial
and
excited
no
remark
i
wonder
where
that
slacker
shoeblossom
has
got
to
said
barry
he
never
turns
up
in
time
to
do
any
work
he
seems
to
regard
himself
as
a
beastly
guest
i
wish
we
could
finish
the
sausages
before
he
comes
it
would
be
a
sell
for
him
not
much
chance
of
that
said
drummond
who
was
kneeling
before
the
fire
and
keeping
an
excited
eye
on
the
spluttering
pan
see
he
come
just
as
we
finished
cooking
them
i
believe
the
man
waits
outside
with
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
hullo
stand
by
with
the
plate
they
be
done
in
half
a
jiffy
just
as
the
last
sausage
was
deposited
in
safety
on
the
plate
the
door
opened
and
shoeblossom
looking
as
if
he
had
not
brushed
his
hair
since
early
childhood
sidled
in
with
an
attempt
at
an
easy
nonchalance
which
was
rendered
quite
impossible
by
the
hopeless
state
of
his
conscience
ah
he
said
brewing
i
see
can
i
be
of
any
use
we
finished
years
ago
said
barry
ages
ago
said
a
look
of
intense
alarm
appeared
on
shoeblossom
classical
features
you
not
finished
really
we
finished
cooking
everything
said
drummond
we
have
begun
tea
yet
now
are
you
happy
shoeblossom
was
so
happy
that
he
felt
he
must
do
something
to
celebrate
the
occasion
he
felt
like
a
successful
general
there
must
be
he
could
do
to
show
that
he
regarded
the
situation
with
approval
he
looked
round
the
study
ha
happy
thought
the
that
useful
culinary
instrument
was
lying
in
the
fender
still
bearing
its
cargo
of
fat
and
beside
it
a
sight
to
stir
the
blood
and
make
the
heart
beat
faster
were
the
sausages
piled
up
on
their
plate
shoeblossom
stooped
he
seized
the
he
gave
it
one
twirl
in
the
air
then
before
any
one
could
stop
him
he
had
turned
it
upside
down
over
the
fire
as
has
been
already
remarked
you
could
never
predict
exactly
what
james
rupert
would
be
up
to
next
when
anything
goes
out
of
the
into
the
fire
it
is
usually
productive
of
interesting
the
maxim
applies
to
fat
the
fat
was
in
the
fire
with
a
vengeance
a
great
sheet
of
flame
rushed
out
and
up
shoeblossom
leaped
back
with
a
readiness
highly
creditable
in
one
who
was
not
a
professional
acrobat
the
covering
of
the
mantelpiece
caught
fire
the
flames
went
roaring
up
the
chimney
drummond
cool
while
everything
else
was
so
hot
without
a
word
moved
to
the
mantelpiece
to
beat
out
the
fire
with
a
football
shirt
bertie
was
talking
rapidly
to
himself
in
french
nobody
could
understand
what
he
was
saying
which
was
possibly
fortunate
by
the
time
drummond
had
extinguished
the
mantelpiece
barry
had
also
done
good
work
by
knocking
the
fire
into
the
grate
with
the
poker
who
had
been
standing
up
till
now
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
gaping
vaguely
at
things
in
general
now
came
into
action
probably
it
was
force
of
habit
that
suggested
to
him
that
the
time
had
come
to
upset
the
kettle
at
any
rate
upset
it
he
did
most
of
it
over
the
glowing
blazing
mass
in
the
grate
the
rest
over
barry
one
of
the
largest
and
most
detestable
smells
the
study
had
ever
had
to
endure
instantly
assailed
their
nostrils
the
fire
in
the
study
was
out
now
but
in
the
chimney
it
still
blazed
merrily
go
up
on
to
the
roof
and
heave
water
down
said
drummond
the
strategist
you
can
get
out
from
milton
dormitory
window
and
take
care
not
to
chuck
it
down
the
wrong
chimney
barry
was
starting
for
the
door
to
carry
out
these
excellent
instructions
when
it
flew
open
pah
what
have
you
boys
been
doing
what
an
abominable
smell
pah
said
a
muffled
voice
it
was
mr
seymour
most
of
his
face
was
concealed
in
a
large
handkerchief
but
by
the
look
of
his
eyes
which
appeared
above
he
did
not
seem
pleased
he
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
fires
in
the
house
were
not
rarities
one
facetious
sportsman
had
once
made
a
rule
of
setting
the
senior
chimney
on
fire
every
term
he
had
since
left
by
request
but
fires
still
occurred
is
the
chimney
on
fire
yes
sir
said
drummond
go
and
find
herbert
and
tell
him
to
take
some
water
on
to
the
roof
and
throw
it
down
herbert
was
the
boot
and
knife
cleaner
at
seymour
barry
went
soon
afterwards
a
splash
of
water
in
the
grate
announced
that
the
intrepid
herbert
was
hard
at
it
another
followed
and
another
then
there
was
a
pause
mr
seymour
thought
he
would
look
up
to
see
if
the
fire
was
out
he
stooped
and
peered
into
the
darkness
and
even
as
he
gazed
splash
came
the
contents
of
the
fourth
pail
together
with
some
soot
with
which
they
had
formed
a
travelling
acquaintance
on
the
way
down
mr
seymour
staggered
back
grimy
and
dripping
there
was
dead
silence
in
the
study
shoeblossom
face
might
have
been
seen
working
convulsively
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
hollow
sepulchral
voice
with
a
strong
cockney
accent
did
yer
see
any
water
come
down
then
sir
said
the
voice
shoeblossom
collapsed
into
a
chair
and
began
to
sob
feebly
disgraceful
scandalous
get
not
to
be
trusted
three
hundred
lines
abominable
surprised
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
not
fit
to
have
studies
atrocious
such
were
the
main
heads
of
mr
seymour
speech
on
the
situation
as
he
dabbed
desperately
at
the
soot
on
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
shoeblossom
stood
and
gurgled
throughout
not
even
the
thought
of
six
hundred
lines
could
quench
that
dauntless
spirit
finally
perorated
mr
seymour
as
he
was
leaving
the
room
as
you
are
evidently
not
to
be
trusted
with
rooms
of
your
own
i
forbid
you
to
enter
them
till
further
notice
it
is
disgraceful
that
such
a
thing
should
happen
do
you
hear
barry
and
you
drummond
you
are
not
to
enter
your
studies
again
till
i
give
you
leave
move
your
books
down
to
the
senior
tonight
and
mr
seymour
stalked
off
to
clean
himself
anyhow
said
shoeblossom
as
his
footsteps
died
away
we
saved
the
sausages
it
is
this
indomitable
gift
of
looking
on
the
bright
side
that
makes
us
englishmen
what
we
are
xi
the
it
was
something
of
a
consolation
to
barry
and
his
friends
at
any
rate
to
barry
and
drummond
that
directly
after
they
had
been
evicted
from
their
study
the
began
except
for
the
ripton
match
the
were
the
most
important
event
of
the
easter
term
even
the
sports
at
the
beginning
of
april
were
productive
of
less
excitement
there
were
twelve
houses
at
wrykyn
and
they
played
on
the
system
to
be
beaten
once
meant
that
a
house
was
no
longer
eligible
for
the
competition
it
could
play
friendlies
as
much
as
it
liked
but
play
it
never
so
wisely
it
could
not
lift
the
cup
thus
it
often
happened
that
a
weak
house
by
fluking
a
victory
over
a
strong
rival
found
itself
much
to
its
surprise
in
the
or
sometimes
even
in
the
final
this
was
rarer
at
football
than
at
cricket
for
at
football
the
better
team
generally
wins
the
favourites
this
year
were
donaldson
though
some
fancied
seymour
donaldson
had
trevor
whose
leadership
was
worth
almost
more
than
his
play
in
no
other
house
was
training
so
rigid
you
could
tell
a
donaldson
man
if
he
was
in
his
at
a
glance
if
you
saw
a
man
eating
oatmeal
biscuits
in
the
shop
and
eyeing
wistfully
the
while
the
stacks
of
buns
and
pastry
you
could
put
him
down
as
a
donaldsonite
without
further
evidence
the
captains
of
the
other
houses
used
to
prescribe
a
certain
amount
of
in
the
matter
of
food
but
trevor
left
his
men
barely
enough
to
support
life
enough
that
is
of
the
things
that
are
really
worth
eating
the
consequence
was
that
donaldson
would
turn
out
for
an
important
match
all
muscle
and
bone
and
on
such
occasions
it
was
bad
for
those
of
their
opponents
who
had
been
taking
life
more
easily
besides
trevor
they
had
clowes
and
had
had
bad
luck
in
not
having
paget
had
paget
stopped
no
other
house
could
have
looked
at
them
but
by
his
departure
the
strength
of
the
team
had
become
more
nearly
on
a
level
with
that
of
seymour
some
even
thought
that
seymour
were
the
stronger
milton
was
as
good
a
forward
as
the
school
possessed
besides
him
there
were
barry
and
on
the
wings
drummond
was
a
useful
half
and
five
of
the
pack
had
either
first
or
second
fifteen
colours
it
was
a
team
that
would
take
some
beating
trevor
came
to
that
conclusion
early
if
we
can
beat
seymour
lift
the
cup
he
said
to
clowes
we
have
to
do
all
we
know
was
clowes
reply
they
were
watching
seymour
pile
up
an
immense
score
against
a
scratch
team
got
up
by
one
of
the
masters
the
first
round
of
the
competition
was
over
donaldson
had
beaten
templar
seymour
the
school
house
templar
were
rather
stronger
than
the
school
house
and
had
beaten
them
by
a
rather
larger
score
than
that
which
seymour
had
run
up
in
their
match
but
neither
trevor
nor
clowes
was
inclined
to
draw
any
augury
from
this
seymour
had
taken
things
easily
after
donaldson
had
kept
going
hard
all
through
that
makes
fourth
try
said
clowes
as
the
wing
of
the
second
fifteen
raced
round
and
scored
in
the
corner
yes
this
is
the
sort
of
game
he
all
right
in
the
man
who
marking
him
is
no
good
barry
scored
twice
and
both
good
tries
too
oh
there
no
doubt
which
is
the
best
man
said
clowes
i
only
mentioned
that
it
was
fourth
as
an
item
of
interest
the
game
continued
barry
scored
a
third
try
we
drawn
against
appleby
next
round
said
trevor
we
can
manage
them
all
right
when
is
it
next
thursday
nomads
match
on
saturday
then
ripton
saturday
week
who
seymour
drawn
day
it
be
a
good
game
too
seymour
ought
to
win
but
have
to
play
their
best
day
have
got
some
good
men
fine
scrum
said
clowes
yes
quick
in
the
open
too
which
is
always
good
business
i
wish
they
beat
seymour
oh
we
ought
to
be
all
right
whichever
wins
appleby
did
not
offer
any
very
serious
resistance
to
the
donaldson
attack
they
were
outplayed
at
every
point
of
the
game
and
before
donaldson
had
scored
their
thirty
points
it
was
a
rule
in
all
matches
and
a
good
rule
too
that
when
one
side
led
by
thirty
points
the
match
stopped
this
prevented
those
massacres
which
do
so
much
towards
crushing
all
the
football
out
of
the
members
of
the
beaten
team
and
it
kept
the
winning
team
from
getting
slack
by
urging
them
on
to
score
their
thirty
points
before
there
were
some
houses
notoriously
slack
which
would
go
for
a
couple
of
seasons
without
ever
playing
the
second
half
of
a
match
having
polished
off
the
men
of
appleby
the
donaldson
team
trooped
off
to
the
other
game
to
see
how
seymour
were
getting
on
with
day
it
was
evidently
an
exciting
match
the
first
half
had
been
played
to
the
accompaniment
of
much
shouting
from
the
ropes
though
coming
so
early
in
the
competition
it
was
really
the
for
whichever
team
won
would
be
almost
certain
to
get
into
the
final
the
school
had
turned
up
in
large
numbers
to
watch
seymour
looking
tired
of
life
said
clowes
that
would
seem
as
if
his
fellows
were
doing
well
what
been
happening
here
asked
trevor
of
an
enthusiast
in
a
seymour
house
cap
whose
face
was
crimson
with
yelling
one
goal
all
replied
the
enthusiast
huskily
did
you
beat
appleby
yes
thirty
points
before
who
been
doing
the
scoring
here
milton
got
in
for
us
he
barged
through
out
of
touch
we
been
pressing
the
whole
time
barry
got
over
once
but
he
was
held
up
hullo
they
beginning
again
buck
up
his
voice
cracking
on
the
high
note
he
took
an
immense
slab
of
vanilla
chocolate
as
a
remedy
for
hoarseness
who
scored
for
day
asked
clowes
strachan
let
him
through
from
their
you
never
saw
anything
so
rotten
as
he
does
take
his
passes
and
strachan
gets
past
him
every
time
is
strachan
playing
on
the
wing
strachan
was
the
first
fifteen
yes
they
put
young
bassett
back
instead
of
him
buck
up
seymour
played
there
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
it
he
broke
off
disgustedly
the
seymourite
playing
centre
next
to
had
run
through
to
the
back
and
passed
out
to
his
wing
as
a
good
centre
should
it
was
a
perfect
pass
except
that
it
came
at
his
head
instead
of
his
chest
nobody
with
any
pretensions
to
decent
play
should
have
missed
it
however
achieved
that
feat
the
ball
struck
his
hands
and
bounded
forward
the
referee
blew
his
whistle
for
a
scrum
and
a
certain
try
was
lost
from
the
scrum
the
seymour
forwards
broke
away
to
the
where
they
were
pulled
up
by
bassett
the
next
minute
the
defence
had
been
pierced
and
drummond
was
lying
on
the
ball
a
yard
across
the
line
the
enthusiast
standing
by
clowes
expended
the
last
relics
of
his
voice
in
commemorating
the
fact
that
his
side
had
the
lead
drummond
be
good
next
year
said
trevor
and
he
made
a
mental
note
to
tell
allardyce
who
would
succeed
him
in
the
command
of
the
school
football
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
player
in
question
the
triumph
of
the
seymourites
was
not
long
lived
milton
failed
to
convert
drummond
try
from
the
from
the
line
barry
got
the
ball
and
punted
into
touch
the
was
not
straight
and
a
scrum
was
formed
the
ball
came
out
to
the
halves
and
went
across
to
strachan
hesitated
and
then
made
a
futile
spring
at
the
first
fifteen
man
neck
strachan
handed
him
off
easily
and
ran
the
seymour
who
was
a
poor
player
failed
to
get
across
in
time
strachan
ran
round
behind
the
posts
the
kick
succeeded
and
day
now
led
by
two
points
after
this
the
game
continued
in
day
half
five
minutes
before
time
was
up
drummond
got
the
ball
from
a
scrum
nearly
on
the
line
passed
it
to
barry
on
the
wing
instead
of
opening
up
the
game
by
passing
to
his
centres
and
barry
slipped
through
in
the
corner
this
put
seymour
just
one
point
ahead
and
there
they
stayed
till
the
whistle
blew
for
milton
walked
over
to
the
with
clowes
and
trevor
he
was
full
of
the
match
particularly
of
the
iniquity
of
i
slanged
him
on
the
field
he
said
it
a
thing
i
do
often
do
but
what
else
you
do
when
a
man
plays
like
that
he
lost
us
three
certain
tries
when
did
you
administer
your
rebuke
inquired
clowes
when
he
had
let
strachan
through
that
second
time
in
the
second
half
i
asked
him
why
on
earth
he
tried
to
play
footer
at
all
i
told
him
a
good
club
was
about
his
form
it
was
rather
cheap
but
i
felt
so
frightfully
sick
about
it
it
sickening
to
be
let
down
like
that
when
you
been
pressing
the
whole
time
and
ought
to
be
scoring
every
other
minute
what
had
he
to
say
on
the
subject
asked
clowes
oh
he
gassed
a
bit
until
i
told
him
i
kick
him
if
he
said
another
word
that
shut
him
up
you
ought
to
have
kicked
him
you
want
all
the
kicking
practice
you
can
get
i
never
saw
anything
feebler
than
that
shot
of
yours
after
drummond
try
i
like
to
see
take
a
kick
like
that
it
was
nearly
on
the
still
when
we
play
you
we
sha
need
to
convert
any
of
our
tries
we
get
our
thirty
points
without
that
perhaps
you
like
to
scratch
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
clowes
confidentially
i
am
going
to
score
seven
tries
against
you
off
my
own
bat
you
be
sorry
you
ever
turned
out
when
we
finished
with
you
xii
news
of
the
gold
bat
shoeblossom
sat
disconsolately
on
the
table
in
the
senior
he
was
not
happy
in
exile
brewing
in
the
senior
was
a
mere
vulgar
brawl
lacking
all
the
refining
influences
of
the
study
you
had
to
fight
for
a
place
at
the
fire
and
when
you
had
got
it
was
not
always
easy
to
keep
it
and
there
was
no
privacy
and
the
fellows
were
always
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
read
a
book
quietly
for
ten
consecutive
minutes
without
some
ass
heaving
a
cushion
at
you
or
turning
out
the
gas
altogether
shoeblossom
yearned
for
the
peace
of
his
study
and
wished
earnestly
that
mr
seymour
would
withdraw
the
order
of
banishment
it
was
the
not
being
able
to
read
that
he
objected
to
chiefly
in
place
of
brewing
the
of
studies
five
six
and
seven
now
made
a
practice
of
going
to
the
school
shop
it
was
more
expensive
and
not
nearly
so
comfortable
there
is
a
romance
about
a
study
brew
which
you
can
never
get
anywhere
else
but
it
served
and
it
was
not
on
this
score
that
he
grumbled
most
what
he
hated
was
having
to
live
in
a
for
shoeblossom
was
a
man
of
moods
give
him
two
or
three
congenial
spirits
to
back
him
up
and
he
would
lead
the
revels
with
the
of
a
mr
bultitude
after
his
return
to
his
original
form
but
he
liked
to
choose
his
accomplices
and
the
gay
sparks
of
the
senior
did
not
appeal
to
him
they
were
not
intellectual
enough
in
his
lucid
intervals
he
was
accustomed
to
be
almost
abnormally
solemn
and
respectable
when
not
promoting
some
unholy
rag
shoeblossom
resembled
an
elderly
gentleman
of
studious
habits
he
liked
to
sit
in
a
comfortable
chair
and
read
a
book
it
was
the
impossibility
of
doing
this
in
the
senior
that
led
him
to
try
and
think
of
some
other
haven
where
he
might
rest
had
it
been
summer
he
would
have
taken
some
literature
out
on
to
the
or
the
downs
and
put
in
a
little
steady
reading
there
with
the
aid
of
a
bag
of
cherries
but
with
the
thermometer
low
that
was
impossible
he
felt
very
lonely
and
dismal
he
was
not
a
man
with
many
friends
in
fact
barry
and
the
other
three
were
almost
the
only
members
of
the
house
with
whom
he
was
on
and
of
these
four
he
saw
very
little
drummond
and
barry
were
always
out
of
doors
or
over
at
the
gymnasium
and
as
for
and
de
bertini
it
was
not
worth
while
talking
to
the
one
and
impossible
to
talk
to
the
other
no
wonder
shoeblossom
felt
dull
once
barry
and
drummond
had
taken
him
over
to
the
gymnasium
with
them
but
this
had
bored
him
worse
than
ever
they
had
been
hard
at
it
all
the
time
for
unlike
a
good
many
of
the
school
they
went
to
the
gymnasium
for
business
not
to
lounge
and
he
had
had
to
sit
about
watching
them
and
watching
gymnastics
was
one
of
the
things
he
most
loathed
since
then
he
had
refused
to
go
that
night
matters
came
to
a
head
just
as
he
had
settled
down
to
read
somebody
in
flinging
a
cushion
across
the
room
brought
down
the
gas
apparatus
with
a
run
and
before
light
was
once
more
restored
it
was
after
that
there
was
preparation
which
lasted
for
two
hours
and
by
the
time
he
had
to
go
to
bed
he
had
not
been
able
to
read
a
single
page
of
the
enthralling
work
with
which
he
was
at
present
occupied
he
had
just
got
into
bed
when
he
was
struck
with
a
brilliant
idea
why
waste
the
precious
hours
in
sleep
what
was
that
saying
of
somebody
five
hours
for
a
wise
man
six
for
somebody
else
he
forgot
whom
eight
for
a
fool
nine
for
an
idiot
or
words
to
that
effect
five
hours
sleep
would
mean
that
he
need
not
go
to
bed
till
half
past
two
in
the
meanwhile
he
could
be
finding
out
exactly
what
the
hero
do
when
he
found
out
to
his
horror
that
it
was
his
cousin
jasper
who
had
really
killed
the
old
gentleman
in
the
wood
the
only
question
was
how
was
he
to
do
his
reading
prefects
were
allowed
to
work
on
after
lights
out
in
their
dormitories
by
the
aid
of
a
candle
but
to
the
ordinary
mortal
this
was
forbidden
then
he
was
struck
with
another
brilliant
idea
it
is
a
curious
thing
about
ideas
you
do
not
get
one
for
over
a
month
and
then
there
comes
a
rush
of
them
all
brilliant
why
he
thought
should
he
not
go
and
read
in
his
study
with
a
dark
lantern
he
had
a
dark
lantern
it
was
one
of
the
things
he
had
found
lying
about
at
home
on
the
last
day
of
the
holidays
and
had
brought
with
him
to
school
it
was
his
custom
to
go
about
the
house
just
before
the
holidays
ended
snapping
up
unconsidered
trifles
which
might
or
might
not
come
in
useful
this
term
he
had
brought
back
a
curious
metal
vase
which
looked
indian
but
which
had
probably
been
made
in
birmingham
the
year
before
last
two
old
coins
of
no
mortal
use
to
anybody
in
the
world
including
himself
and
the
dark
lantern
it
was
reposing
now
in
the
cupboard
in
his
study
nearest
the
window
he
had
brought
his
book
up
with
him
on
coming
to
bed
on
the
chance
that
he
might
have
time
to
read
a
page
or
two
if
he
woke
up
early
he
had
always
been
doubtful
about
that
man
jasper
for
one
thing
he
had
been
seen
pawning
the
old
gentleman
watch
on
the
afternoon
of
the
murder
which
was
a
suspicious
circumstance
and
then
he
was
not
a
nice
character
at
all
and
just
the
sort
of
man
who
would
be
likely
to
murder
old
gentlemen
in
woods
he
waited
till
mr
seymour
had
paid
his
nightly
visit
he
went
the
round
of
the
dormitories
at
about
eleven
and
then
he
chuckled
gently
if
mill
the
dormitory
prefect
was
awake
the
chuckle
would
make
him
speak
for
mill
was
of
a
suspicious
nature
and
believed
that
it
was
only
his
unintermitted
vigilance
which
prevented
the
dormitory
ragging
all
night
mill
awake
be
quiet
there
he
growled
shut
up
that
noise
shoeblossom
felt
that
the
time
was
not
yet
ripe
for
his
departure
half
an
hour
later
he
tried
again
there
was
no
rebuke
to
make
certain
he
emitted
a
second
chuckle
replete
with
sinister
meaning
a
slight
snore
came
from
the
direction
of
mill
bed
shoeblossom
crept
out
of
the
room
and
hurried
to
his
study
the
door
was
not
locked
for
mr
seymour
had
relied
on
his
commands
being
sufficient
to
keep
the
owner
out
of
it
he
slipped
in
found
and
lit
the
dark
lantern
and
settled
down
to
read
he
read
with
feverish
excitement
the
thing
was
you
see
that
though
claud
trevelyan
that
was
the
hero
knew
jolly
well
that
it
was
jasper
who
had
done
the
murder
the
police
did
and
as
he
claud
was
too
noble
to
tell
them
he
had
himself
been
arrested
on
suspicion
shoeblossom
was
skimming
through
the
pages
with
starting
eyes
when
suddenly
his
attention
was
taken
from
his
book
by
a
sound
it
was
a
footstep
somebody
was
coming
down
the
passage
and
under
the
door
filtered
a
thin
stream
of
light
to
snap
the
dark
slide
over
the
lantern
and
dart
to
the
door
so
that
if
it
opened
he
would
be
behind
it
was
with
him
as
mr
claud
trevelyan
might
have
remarked
the
work
of
a
moment
he
heard
the
door
of
study
number
five
flung
open
and
then
the
footsteps
passed
on
and
stopped
opposite
his
own
den
the
handle
turned
and
the
light
of
a
candle
flashed
into
the
room
to
be
extinguished
instantly
as
the
draught
of
the
moving
door
caught
it
shoeblossom
heard
his
visitor
utter
an
exclamation
of
annoyance
and
fumble
in
his
pocket
for
matches
he
recognised
the
voice
it
was
mr
seymour
the
fact
was
that
mr
seymour
had
had
the
same
experience
as
general
stanley
in
pirates
of
the
man
who
finds
his
conscience
ache
no
peace
at
all
enjoys
and
as
i
lay
in
bed
awake
i
thought
i
heard
a
noise
whether
mr
seymour
conscience
ached
or
not
can
not
of
course
be
discovered
but
he
had
certainly
thought
he
heard
a
noise
and
he
had
come
to
investigate
the
search
for
matches
had
so
far
proved
fruitless
shoeblossom
stood
and
quaked
behind
the
door
the
reek
of
hot
tin
from
the
dark
lantern
grew
worse
momentarily
mr
seymour
sniffed
several
times
until
shoeblossom
thought
that
he
must
be
discovered
then
to
his
immense
relief
the
master
walked
away
shoeblossom
chance
had
come
mr
seymour
had
probably
gone
to
get
some
matches
to
relight
his
candle
it
was
far
from
likely
that
the
episode
was
closed
he
would
be
back
again
presently
if
shoeblossom
was
going
to
escape
he
must
do
it
now
so
he
waited
till
the
footsteps
had
passed
away
and
then
darted
out
in
the
direction
of
his
dormitory
as
he
was
passing
milton
study
a
white
figure
glided
out
of
it
all
that
he
had
ever
read
or
heard
of
spectres
rushed
into
petrified
brain
he
wished
he
was
safely
in
bed
he
wished
he
had
never
come
out
of
it
he
wished
he
had
led
a
better
and
nobler
life
he
wished
he
had
never
been
born
the
figure
passed
quite
close
to
him
as
he
stood
glued
against
the
wall
and
he
saw
it
disappear
into
the
dormitory
opposite
his
own
of
which
rigby
was
prefect
he
blushed
hotly
at
the
thought
of
the
fright
he
had
been
in
it
was
only
somebody
playing
the
same
game
as
himself
he
jumped
into
bed
and
lay
down
having
first
plunged
the
lantern
bodily
into
his
jug
to
extinguish
it
its
indignant
hiss
had
scarcely
died
away
when
mr
seymour
appeared
at
the
door
it
had
occurred
to
mr
seymour
that
he
had
smelt
something
very
much
out
of
the
ordinary
in
shoeblossom
study
a
smell
uncommonly
like
that
of
hot
tin
and
a
suspicion
dawned
on
him
that
shoeblossom
had
been
in
there
with
a
dark
lantern
he
had
come
to
the
dormitory
to
confirm
his
suspicions
but
a
glance
showed
him
how
unjust
they
had
been
there
was
shoeblossom
fast
asleep
mr
seymour
therefore
followed
the
excellent
example
of
my
lord
tomnoddy
on
a
celebrated
occasion
and
went
off
to
bed
it
was
the
custom
for
the
captain
of
football
at
wrykyn
to
select
and
publish
the
team
for
the
ripton
match
a
week
before
the
day
on
which
it
was
to
be
played
on
the
evening
after
the
nomads
match
trevor
was
sitting
in
his
study
writing
out
the
names
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
his
fag
entered
with
a
letter
this
has
just
come
trevor
he
said
all
right
put
it
down
the
fag
left
the
room
trevor
picked
up
the
letter
the
handwriting
was
strange
to
him
the
words
had
been
printed
then
it
flashed
upon
him
that
he
had
received
a
letter
once
before
addressed
in
the
same
way
the
letter
from
the
league
about
barry
was
this
too
from
that
address
he
opened
it
it
was
he
read
it
and
gasped
the
worst
had
happened
the
gold
bat
was
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
xiii
victim
number
three
with
reference
to
our
last
communication
ran
the
letter
the
writer
evidently
believed
in
the
commercial
style
it
may
interest
you
to
know
that
the
bat
you
lost
by
the
statue
on
the
night
of
the
of
january
has
come
into
our
possession
observe
that
barry
is
still
playing
for
the
first
and
will
jolly
well
continue
to
muttered
trevor
crumpling
the
paper
viciously
into
a
ball
he
went
on
writing
the
names
for
the
ripton
match
the
last
name
on
the
list
was
barry
then
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
and
began
to
wrestle
with
this
new
development
barry
must
play
that
was
certain
all
the
bluff
in
the
world
was
not
going
to
keep
him
from
playing
the
best
man
at
his
disposal
in
the
ripton
match
he
himself
did
not
count
it
was
the
school
he
had
to
think
of
this
being
so
what
was
likely
to
happen
though
nothing
was
said
on
the
point
he
felt
certain
that
if
he
persisted
in
ignoring
the
league
that
bat
would
find
its
way
somehow
by
devious
routes
possibly
to
the
headmaster
or
some
one
else
in
authority
and
then
there
would
be
questions
awkward
questions
and
things
would
begin
to
come
out
then
a
fresh
point
struck
him
which
was
that
whatever
might
happen
would
affect
not
himself
but
this
made
it
rather
more
of
a
problem
how
to
act
personally
he
was
one
of
those
dogged
characters
who
can
put
up
with
almost
anything
themselves
if
this
had
been
his
affair
he
would
have
gone
on
his
way
without
hesitating
evidently
the
writer
of
the
letter
was
under
the
impression
that
he
had
been
the
hero
or
villain
of
the
statue
escapade
if
everything
came
out
it
did
not
require
any
great
effort
of
prophecy
to
predict
what
the
result
would
be
would
go
promptly
he
would
receive
his
marching
orders
within
ten
minutes
of
the
discovery
of
what
he
had
done
he
would
be
expelled
twice
over
so
to
speak
once
for
breaking
out
at
night
one
of
the
most
heinous
offences
in
the
school
code
and
once
for
tarring
the
statue
anything
that
gave
the
school
a
bad
name
in
the
town
was
a
crime
in
the
eyes
of
the
powers
and
this
was
such
a
particularly
flagrant
case
yes
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
would
take
the
first
train
home
without
waiting
to
pack
up
trevor
knew
his
people
well
and
he
could
imagine
their
feelings
when
the
prodigal
strolled
into
their
midst
an
old
wrykinian
as
the
philosopher
said
of
falling
off
a
ladder
it
is
not
the
falling
that
matters
it
is
the
sudden
stopping
at
the
other
end
it
is
not
the
being
expelled
that
is
so
peculiarly
objectionable
it
is
the
sudden
homecoming
with
this
gloomy
vision
before
him
trevor
almost
wavered
but
the
thought
that
the
selection
of
the
team
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
his
personal
feelings
strengthened
him
he
was
simply
a
machine
devised
to
select
the
fifteen
best
men
in
the
school
to
meet
ripton
in
his
official
capacity
of
football
captain
he
was
not
supposed
to
have
any
feelings
however
he
yielded
in
so
far
that
he
went
to
clowes
to
ask
his
opinion
clowes
having
heard
everything
and
seen
the
letter
unhesitatingly
voted
for
the
right
course
if
fifty
mad
irishmen
were
to
be
expelled
barry
must
play
against
ripton
he
was
the
best
man
and
in
he
must
go
that
what
i
thought
said
trevor
it
bad
for
though
clowes
remarked
somewhat
tritely
that
business
was
business
besides
he
went
on
you
assuming
that
the
thing
this
letter
hints
at
will
really
come
off
i
do
think
it
will
a
man
would
have
to
be
such
an
awful
blackguard
to
go
as
low
as
that
the
least
grain
of
decency
in
him
would
stop
him
i
can
imagine
a
man
threatening
to
do
it
as
a
piece
of
bluff
by
the
way
the
letter
does
actually
say
anything
of
the
sort
though
i
suppose
it
hints
at
it
but
i
imagine
anybody
out
of
a
melodrama
doing
it
you
can
never
tell
said
trevor
he
felt
that
this
was
but
an
outside
chance
the
forbearance
of
one
antagonist
is
but
a
poor
thing
to
trust
to
at
the
best
of
times
are
you
going
to
tell
asked
clowes
i
do
see
the
good
would
you
no
he
ca
do
anything
and
it
would
only
give
him
a
bad
time
there
are
pleasanter
things
i
should
think
than
going
on
from
day
to
day
not
knowing
whether
you
going
to
be
sacked
or
not
within
the
next
twelve
hours
do
tell
him
i
wo
and
barry
plays
against
ripton
certainly
he
the
best
man
i
going
over
to
seymour
now
said
trevor
after
a
pause
to
see
milton
we
drawn
seymour
in
the
next
round
of
the
i
suppose
you
knew
i
want
to
get
it
over
before
the
ripton
match
for
several
reasons
about
half
the
fifteen
are
playing
on
one
side
or
the
other
and
it
give
them
a
good
chance
of
getting
fit
running
and
passing
is
all
right
but
a
good
hard
game
the
thing
for
putting
you
into
form
and
then
i
was
thinking
that
as
the
side
that
loses
whichever
it
is
seymour
of
course
hope
so
well
they
bound
to
be
a
bit
sick
at
losing
so
play
up
all
the
harder
on
saturday
to
console
themselves
for
losing
the
cup
my
word
what
strategy
said
clowes
you
think
of
everything
when
do
you
think
of
playing
it
then
wednesday
struck
me
as
a
good
day
do
you
think
so
it
would
do
splendidly
it
be
a
good
match
for
all
practical
purposes
of
course
it
the
final
if
we
beat
seymour
i
think
the
others
will
trouble
us
much
there
was
just
time
to
see
milton
before
trevor
ran
across
to
seymour
and
went
up
to
his
study
come
in
said
milton
in
answer
to
his
knock
trevor
went
in
and
stood
surprised
at
the
difference
in
the
look
of
the
place
since
the
last
time
he
had
visited
it
the
walls
once
covered
with
photographs
were
bare
milton
seated
before
the
fire
was
ruefully
contemplating
what
looked
like
a
heap
of
waste
cardboard
trevor
recognised
the
symptoms
he
had
had
experience
you
do
mean
to
say
they
been
at
you
too
he
cried
milton
normally
cheerful
face
was
thunderous
and
gloomy
yes
i
was
thinking
what
i
like
to
do
to
the
man
who
ragged
it
it
the
league
again
i
suppose
milton
looked
surprised
he
said
where
did
hear
of
the
league
this
is
the
first
time
i
heard
of
its
existence
whatever
it
is
what
is
the
confounded
thing
and
why
on
earth
have
they
played
the
fool
here
what
the
meaning
of
this
bally
rot
he
exhibited
one
of
the
variety
of
cards
of
which
trevor
had
already
seen
two
specimens
trevor
explained
briefly
the
style
and
nature
of
the
league
and
mentioned
that
his
study
also
had
been
wrecked
your
study
why
what
have
they
got
against
you
i
do
know
said
trevor
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
speaking
of
the
letters
he
had
received
did
they
cut
up
your
photographs
every
one
i
tell
you
what
it
is
trevor
old
chap
said
milton
with
great
solemnity
there
a
lunatic
in
the
school
that
what
i
make
of
it
a
lunatic
whose
form
of
madness
is
wrecking
studies
but
the
same
chap
could
have
done
yours
and
mine
it
must
have
been
a
donaldson
fellow
who
did
mine
and
one
of
your
chaps
who
did
yours
and
mill
mill
by
jove
of
course
i
never
thought
of
that
that
was
the
league
too
i
suppose
yes
one
of
those
cards
was
tied
to
a
chair
but
clowes
took
it
away
before
anybody
saw
it
milton
returned
to
the
details
of
the
disaster
was
there
any
ink
spilt
in
your
room
pints
said
trevor
shortly
the
subject
was
painful
so
there
was
here
said
milton
mournfully
gallons
there
was
silence
for
a
while
each
pondering
over
his
wrongs
gallons
said
milton
again
i
was
ass
enough
to
keep
a
large
pot
full
of
it
here
and
they
used
it
all
every
drop
you
never
saw
such
a
sight
trevor
said
he
had
seen
one
similar
spectacle
and
my
photographs
you
remember
those
photographs
i
showed
you
all
ruined
slit
across
with
a
knife
some
torn
in
half
i
wish
i
knew
who
did
that
trevor
said
he
wished
so
too
there
was
one
of
mrs
patrick
campbell
milton
continued
in
heartrending
tones
which
was
torn
into
sixteen
pieces
i
counted
them
there
they
are
on
the
mantelpiece
and
there
was
one
of
little
tich
here
he
almost
broke
down
which
was
so
covered
with
ink
that
for
half
an
hour
i
could
recognise
it
fact
trevor
nodded
sympathetically
yes
said
milton
soaked
there
was
another
silence
trevor
felt
it
would
be
almost
an
outrage
to
discuss
so
prosaic
a
topic
as
the
date
of
a
with
one
so
broken
up
yet
time
was
flying
and
was
drawing
near
are
you
willing
to
play
he
began
i
feel
as
if
i
could
never
play
again
interrupted
milton
hardly
believe
the
amount
of
i
used
today
it
must
have
been
a
lunatic
dick
old
man
when
milton
called
trevor
dick
it
was
a
sign
that
he
was
moved
when
he
called
him
dick
old
man
it
gave
evidence
of
an
internal
upheaval
without
parallel
why
who
else
but
a
lunatic
would
get
up
in
the
night
to
wreck
another
chap
study
all
this
was
done
between
eleven
last
night
and
seven
this
morning
i
turned
in
at
eleven
and
when
i
came
down
here
again
at
seven
the
place
was
a
wreck
it
must
have
been
a
lunatic
how
do
you
account
for
the
printed
card
from
the
league
milton
murmured
something
about
madmen
cunning
and
diverting
suspicion
and
relapsed
into
silence
trevor
seized
the
opportunity
to
make
the
proposal
he
had
come
to
make
that
donaldson
seymour
should
be
played
on
the
following
wednesday
milton
agreed
listlessly
just
where
you
standing
he
said
i
found
a
photograph
of
sir
henry
irving
so
slashed
about
that
i
thought
at
first
it
was
huntley
wright
in
start
at
sharp
said
trevor
i
had
seventeen
of
edna
may
continued
the
stricken
seymourite
monotonously
in
various
attitudes
all
destroyed
on
the
first
fifteen
ground
of
course
said
trevor
i
get
aldridge
to
referee
that
suit
you
i
suppose
all
right
anything
you
like
just
by
the
fireplace
i
found
the
remains
of
arthur
roberts
in
and
part
of
seymour
hicks
under
the
table
trevor
departed
xiv
the
white
figure
suppose
said
shoeblossom
to
barry
as
they
were
walking
over
to
school
on
the
morning
following
the
day
on
which
milton
study
had
passed
through
the
hands
of
the
league
suppose
you
thought
somebody
had
done
something
but
you
were
quite
certain
who
but
you
knew
it
was
some
one
what
would
you
do
what
on
do
you
mean
inquired
barry
i
was
trying
to
make
an
case
of
it
explained
shoeblossom
what
an
case
i
do
know
admitted
shoeblossom
frankly
but
it
comes
in
a
book
of
stevenson
i
think
it
must
mean
a
sort
of
case
where
you
call
everyone
and
and
do
tell
their
names
well
go
ahead
it
about
milton
study
what
what
about
it
well
you
see
the
night
it
was
ragged
i
was
sitting
in
my
study
with
a
dark
lantern
what
shoeblossom
proceeded
to
relate
the
moving
narrative
of
his
adventure
he
dwelt
movingly
on
his
state
of
mind
when
standing
behind
the
door
waiting
for
mr
seymour
to
come
in
and
find
him
he
related
with
appropriate
force
the
episode
of
the
weird
white
figure
and
then
he
came
to
the
conclusions
he
had
since
drawn
in
calmer
moments
from
that
apparition
movements
you
see
he
said
i
saw
it
coming
out
of
milton
study
and
that
must
have
been
about
the
time
the
study
was
ragged
and
it
went
into
rigby
dorm
so
it
must
have
been
a
chap
in
that
dorm
who
did
it
shoeblossom
was
quite
clever
at
rare
intervals
even
barry
whose
belief
in
his
sanity
was
of
the
smallest
was
compelled
to
admit
that
here
at
any
rate
he
was
talking
sense
what
would
you
do
asked
shoeblossom
tell
milton
of
course
said
barry
but
he
give
me
beans
for
being
out
of
the
dorm
after
this
was
a
distinct
point
to
be
considered
the
attitude
of
barry
towards
milton
was
different
from
that
of
shoeblossom
barry
regarded
him
through
having
played
with
him
in
important
matches
as
a
good
sort
of
fellow
who
had
always
behaved
decently
to
him
on
the
other
hand
looked
on
him
with
undisguised
apprehension
as
one
in
authority
who
would
give
him
lines
the
first
time
he
came
into
contact
with
him
and
cane
him
if
he
ever
did
it
again
he
had
a
decided
disinclination
to
see
milton
on
any
pretext
whatever
suppose
i
tell
him
suggested
barry
you
keep
my
name
dark
said
shoeblossom
alarmed
barry
said
he
would
make
an
case
of
it
after
school
he
went
to
milton
study
and
found
him
still
brooding
over
its
departed
glories
i
say
milton
can
i
speak
to
you
for
a
second
hullo
barry
come
in
barry
came
in
i
had
photographs
began
milton
without
preamble
all
destroyed
and
i
no
money
to
buy
any
more
i
had
seventeen
of
edna
may
barry
feeling
that
he
was
expected
to
say
something
said
by
jove
really
in
various
positions
continued
milton
all
ruined
not
really
said
barry
there
was
one
of
little
tich
but
barry
felt
unequal
to
playing
the
part
of
chorus
any
longer
it
was
all
very
thrilling
but
if
milton
was
going
to
run
through
the
entire
list
of
his
destroyed
photographs
life
would
be
too
short
for
conversation
on
any
other
topic
i
say
milton
he
said
it
was
about
that
that
i
came
i
sorry
milton
sat
up
it
was
you
who
did
this
was
it
no
no
said
barry
hastily
oh
i
thought
from
your
saying
you
were
sorry
i
was
going
to
say
i
thought
i
could
put
you
on
the
track
of
the
chap
who
did
do
it
for
the
second
time
since
the
interview
began
milton
sat
up
go
on
he
but
i
sorry
i
ca
give
you
the
name
of
the
fellow
who
told
me
about
it
that
does
matter
said
milton
tell
me
the
name
of
the
fellow
who
did
it
that
satisfy
me
i
afraid
i
ca
do
that
either
have
you
any
idea
what
you
do
asked
milton
satirically
i
can
tell
you
something
which
may
put
you
on
the
right
track
that
do
for
a
start
well
well
the
chap
who
told
me
i
call
him
i
going
to
make
an
case
of
it
was
coming
out
of
his
study
at
about
one
in
the
morning
what
the
deuce
was
he
doing
that
for
because
he
wanted
to
go
back
to
bed
said
barry
about
time
too
well
as
he
was
going
past
your
study
a
white
figure
emerged
i
should
strongly
advise
you
young
barry
said
milton
gravely
not
to
try
and
rot
me
in
any
way
you
a
jolly
good
wing
but
you
should
presume
on
it
i
slay
the
old
man
himself
if
he
rotted
me
about
this
business
barry
was
quite
pained
at
this
sceptical
attitude
in
one
whom
he
was
going
out
of
his
way
to
assist
i
not
rotting
he
protested
this
is
all
quite
true
well
go
on
you
were
saying
something
about
white
figures
emerging
not
white
figures
a
white
figure
corrected
barry
it
came
out
of
your
study
and
vanished
through
the
wall
it
went
into
rigby
said
barry
sulkily
it
was
maddening
to
have
an
exclusive
bit
of
news
treated
in
this
way
did
it
by
jove
said
milton
interested
at
last
are
you
sure
the
chap
who
told
you
was
pulling
your
leg
who
was
it
told
you
i
promised
him
not
to
say
out
with
it
young
barry
i
wo
said
barry
you
are
going
to
tell
me
no
milton
gave
up
the
point
with
much
cheerfulness
he
liked
barry
and
he
realised
that
he
had
no
right
to
try
and
make
him
break
his
promise
that
all
right
he
said
thanks
very
much
barry
this
may
be
useful
i
tell
you
his
name
if
i
had
promised
you
know
milton
it
does
matter
said
milton
it
not
important
oh
there
was
one
thing
i
forgot
it
was
a
biggish
chap
the
fellow
saw
how
big
my
size
not
quite
so
tall
i
should
think
he
said
he
was
about
size
thanks
that
worth
knowing
thanks
very
much
barry
when
his
visitor
had
gone
milton
proceeded
to
unearth
one
of
the
printed
lists
of
the
house
which
were
used
for
purposes
of
he
meant
to
find
out
who
were
in
rigby
dormitory
he
put
a
tick
against
the
names
there
were
eighteen
of
them
the
next
thing
was
to
find
out
which
of
them
was
about
the
same
height
as
mr
seymour
it
was
a
somewhat
vague
description
for
the
stood
about
five
feet
nine
or
eight
and
a
good
many
of
the
dormitory
were
that
height
or
near
it
at
last
after
much
he
reduced
the
number
of
possibles
to
seven
these
seven
were
rigby
himself
linton
griffith
hunt
kershaw
and
chapple
rigby
might
be
scratched
off
the
list
at
once
he
was
one
of
milton
greatest
friends
exeunt
also
griffith
hunt
and
kershaw
they
were
mild
youths
quite
incapable
of
any
deed
of
devilry
there
remained
therefore
chapple
linton
and
chapple
was
a
boy
who
was
invariably
late
for
breakfast
the
inference
was
that
he
was
not
likely
to
forego
his
sleep
for
the
purpose
of
wrecking
studies
chapple
might
disappear
from
the
list
now
there
were
only
linton
and
to
be
considered
his
suspicions
fell
on
linton
was
the
last
person
he
thought
to
do
such
a
low
thing
he
was
a
cheerful
rollicking
individual
who
was
popular
with
everyone
and
seemed
to
like
everyone
he
was
not
an
orderly
member
of
the
house
certainly
and
on
several
occasions
milton
had
found
it
necessary
to
drop
on
him
heavily
for
creating
disturbances
but
he
was
not
the
sort
that
bears
malice
he
took
it
all
in
the
way
of
business
and
came
up
smiling
after
it
was
over
no
everything
pointed
to
he
and
milton
had
never
got
on
well
together
and
quite
recently
they
had
quarrelled
openly
over
the
former
play
in
the
match
must
be
the
man
but
milton
was
sensible
enough
to
feel
that
so
far
he
had
no
real
evidence
whatever
he
must
wait
on
the
following
afternoon
seymour
turned
out
to
play
donaldson
the
game
like
most
was
played
with
the
utmost
keenness
both
teams
had
good
and
they
attacked
in
turn
seymour
had
the
best
of
it
forward
where
milton
was
playing
a
great
game
but
trevor
in
the
centre
was
the
best
outside
on
the
field
and
pulled
up
rush
after
rush
by
neither
side
had
scored
after
seymour
playing
downhill
came
away
with
a
rush
to
the
donaldsonites
half
and
with
one
of
the
few
decent
runs
he
had
made
in
good
class
football
that
term
ran
in
on
the
left
milton
took
the
kick
but
failed
and
seymour
led
by
three
points
for
the
next
twenty
minutes
nothing
more
was
scored
then
when
five
minutes
more
of
play
remained
trevor
gave
clowes
an
easy
opening
and
clowes
sprinted
between
the
posts
the
kick
was
an
easy
one
and
what
sporting
reporters
term
the
major
points
were
easily
added
when
there
are
five
more
minutes
to
play
in
an
important
and
one
side
has
scored
a
goal
and
the
other
a
try
play
is
apt
to
become
spirited
both
teams
were
doing
all
they
knew
the
ball
came
out
to
barry
on
the
right
barry
abilities
as
a
rested
chiefly
on
the
fact
that
he
could
dodge
well
this
attribute
compensated
for
a
certain
lack
of
pace
he
was
past
the
in
an
instant
and
running
for
the
line
with
only
the
back
to
pass
and
with
clowes
in
hot
pursuit
another
wriggle
took
him
past
the
back
but
it
also
gave
clowes
time
to
catch
him
up
clowes
was
a
far
faster
runner
and
he
got
to
him
just
as
he
reached
the
line
they
came
down
together
with
a
crash
clowes
on
top
and
as
they
fell
the
whistle
blew
said
aldridge
the
master
who
was
refereeing
clowes
got
up
all
over
he
said
jolly
good
game
hullo
what
up
for
barry
seemed
to
be
in
trouble
you
might
give
us
a
hand
up
said
the
latter
i
believe
i
twisted
my
beastly
ankle
or
something
xv
a
sprain
and
a
vacant
place
i
say
said
clowes
helping
him
up
i
awfully
sorry
did
i
do
it
how
did
it
happen
barry
was
engaged
in
making
various
attempts
at
standing
on
the
injured
leg
the
process
seemed
to
be
painful
shall
i
get
a
stretcher
or
anything
can
you
walk
if
you
help
me
over
to
the
house
i
could
manage
all
right
what
a
beastly
nuisance
it
was
your
fault
a
bit
only
you
tackled
me
when
i
was
just
trying
to
swerve
and
my
ankle
was
all
twisted
drummond
came
up
carrying
barry
blazer
and
sweater
hullo
barry
he
said
what
up
you
are
crocked
something
gone
wrong
with
my
ankle
that
my
blazer
thanks
coming
over
to
the
house
clowes
was
just
going
to
help
me
over
clowes
asked
a
donaldson
junior
who
was
lurking
near
at
hand
to
fetch
his
blazer
and
carry
it
over
to
the
house
and
then
made
his
way
with
drummond
and
the
disabled
barry
to
seymour
having
arrived
at
the
senior
they
deposited
the
injured
in
a
chair
and
sent
who
came
in
at
the
moment
to
fetch
the
doctor
dr
oakes
was
a
big
man
with
a
breezy
manner
the
sort
of
doctor
who
hits
you
with
the
force
of
a
in
the
small
ribs
and
asks
you
if
you
felt
anything
it
was
on
this
principle
that
he
acted
with
regard
to
barry
ankle
he
seized
it
in
both
hands
and
gave
it
a
wrench
did
that
hurt
he
inquired
anxiously
barry
turned
white
and
replied
that
it
did
dr
oakes
nodded
wisely
ah
h
just
so
ah
is
it
bad
asked
drummond
awed
by
these
mystic
utterances
my
dear
boy
replied
the
doctor
breezily
it
is
always
bad
when
one
twists
one
ankle
how
long
will
it
do
me
out
of
footer
asked
barry
how
long
how
long
how
long
why
fortnight
fortnight
said
the
doctor
then
i
sha
be
able
to
play
next
saturday
next
saturday
next
saturday
my
dear
boy
if
you
can
put
your
foot
to
the
ground
by
next
saturday
you
may
take
it
as
evidence
that
the
age
of
miracles
is
not
past
next
saturday
indeed
ha
ha
it
was
not
altogether
his
fault
that
he
treated
the
matter
with
such
brutal
levity
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
had
been
at
school
and
he
could
not
quite
realise
what
it
meant
to
barry
not
to
be
able
to
play
against
ripton
as
for
barry
he
felt
that
he
had
never
loathed
and
detested
any
one
so
thoroughly
as
he
loathed
and
detested
dr
oakes
at
that
moment
i
do
see
where
the
joke
comes
in
said
clowes
when
he
had
gone
i
bar
that
man
he
a
beast
said
drummond
i
ca
understand
why
they
let
a
tout
like
that
be
the
school
doctor
barry
said
nothing
he
was
too
sore
for
words
what
dr
oakes
said
to
his
wife
that
evening
was
over
at
the
school
my
dear
this
afternoon
this
afternoon
boy
with
a
twisted
ankle
nice
young
fellow
very
much
put
out
when
i
told
him
he
could
not
play
football
for
a
fortnight
but
i
chaffed
him
and
cheered
him
up
in
no
time
i
cheered
him
up
in
no
time
my
dear
i
sure
you
did
dear
said
mrs
oakes
which
shows
how
differently
the
same
thing
may
strike
different
people
barry
certainly
did
not
look
as
if
he
had
been
cheered
up
when
clowes
left
the
study
and
went
over
to
tell
trevor
that
he
would
have
to
find
a
substitute
for
his
right
wing
against
ripton
trevor
had
left
the
field
without
noticing
barry
accident
and
he
was
tremendously
pleased
at
the
result
of
the
game
good
man
he
said
when
clowes
came
in
you
saved
the
match
and
lost
the
ripton
match
probably
said
clowes
gloomily
what
do
you
mean
that
last
time
i
brought
down
barry
i
crocked
him
he
in
his
study
now
with
a
sprained
ankle
i
just
come
from
there
oakes
has
seen
him
and
says
he
must
play
for
a
fortnight
great
scott
said
trevor
blankly
what
on
earth
shall
we
do
why
not
move
strachan
up
to
the
wing
and
put
somebody
else
back
instead
of
him
strachan
is
a
good
wing
trevor
shook
his
head
no
there
nobody
good
enough
to
play
back
for
the
first
we
risk
it
then
i
suppose
it
must
be
i
suppose
so
he
may
do
better
than
we
think
he
played
quite
a
decent
game
today
that
try
he
got
was
half
a
bad
one
he
be
all
right
if
he
did
funk
but
perhaps
he
would
funk
against
ripton
in
a
match
like
that
anybody
would
play
up
i
ask
milton
and
allardyce
about
it
i
should
go
to
milton
today
said
clowes
i
fancy
he
want
a
night
rest
before
he
fit
to
talk
to
he
must
be
a
bit
sick
about
this
match
i
know
he
expected
seymour
to
win
he
went
out
but
came
back
almost
immediately
i
say
he
said
there
one
thing
that
just
occurred
to
me
this
please
the
league
i
mean
this
ankle
business
of
barry
the
same
idea
had
struck
trevor
it
was
certainly
a
respite
but
he
regretted
it
for
all
that
what
he
wanted
was
to
beat
ripton
and
barry
absence
would
weaken
the
team
however
it
was
good
in
its
way
and
cleared
the
atmosphere
for
the
time
the
league
would
hardly
do
anything
with
regard
to
the
carrying
out
of
their
threat
while
barry
was
on
the
next
day
having
given
him
time
to
get
over
the
bitterness
of
defeat
in
accordance
with
clowes
thoughtful
suggestion
trevor
called
on
milton
and
asked
him
what
his
opinion
was
on
the
subject
of
the
inclusion
of
in
the
first
fifteen
in
place
of
barry
he
the
next
best
man
he
added
in
defence
of
the
proposal
i
suppose
so
said
milton
he
better
play
i
suppose
there
no
one
else
clowes
thought
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
to
shove
strachan
on
the
wing
and
put
somebody
else
back
who
is
there
to
put
jervis
not
good
enough
no
it
better
to
be
weakish
on
the
wing
than
at
back
besides
may
do
all
right
he
played
well
against
you
yes
said
trevor
study
looks
a
bit
better
now
he
added
as
he
was
going
having
looked
round
the
room
still
a
bit
bare
though
milton
sighed
it
will
never
be
what
it
was
theatrical
photographs
want
some
replacing
of
course
said
trevor
but
it
is
bad
considering
how
yours
oh
mine
all
right
except
for
the
absence
of
photographs
i
say
trevor
yes
said
trevor
stopping
at
the
door
milton
voice
had
taken
on
the
tone
of
one
who
is
about
to
disclose
dreadful
secrets
would
you
like
to
know
what
i
think
what
why
i
pretty
nearly
sure
who
it
was
that
ragged
my
study
by
jove
what
have
you
done
to
him
nothing
as
yet
i
not
quite
sure
of
my
man
who
is
the
man
by
jove
clowes
once
said
he
thought
must
be
the
president
of
the
league
but
then
i
do
see
how
you
can
account
for
study
being
wrecked
he
was
out
on
the
field
when
it
was
done
why
the
league
of
course
you
do
suppose
he
the
only
man
in
it
there
must
be
a
lot
of
them
but
what
makes
you
think
it
was
milton
told
him
the
story
of
shoeblossom
as
barry
had
told
it
to
him
the
only
difference
was
that
trevor
listened
without
any
of
the
scepticism
which
milton
had
displayed
on
hearing
it
he
was
getting
excited
it
all
fitted
in
so
neatly
if
ever
there
was
circumstantial
evidence
against
a
man
here
it
was
against
take
the
two
cases
milton
had
quarrelled
with
him
milton
study
was
wrecked
with
the
compliments
of
the
league
trevor
had
turned
him
out
of
the
first
fifteen
trevor
study
was
wrecked
with
the
compliments
of
the
league
as
clowes
had
pointed
out
the
man
with
the
most
obvious
motive
for
not
wishing
barry
to
play
for
the
school
was
it
seemed
a
true
bill
i
should
wonder
if
you
right
he
said
but
of
course
one
do
anything
yet
you
want
a
lot
more
evidence
anyhow
we
must
play
him
against
ripton
i
suppose
which
is
his
study
i
go
and
tell
him
now
ten
trevor
knocked
at
the
door
of
study
ten
was
sitting
over
the
fire
reading
he
jumped
up
when
he
saw
that
it
was
trevor
who
had
come
in
and
to
his
visitor
it
seemed
that
his
face
wore
a
guilty
look
what
do
you
want
said
it
was
not
the
politest
way
of
welcoming
a
visitor
it
increased
trevor
suspicions
the
man
was
afraid
a
great
idea
darted
into
his
mind
why
not
go
straight
to
the
point
and
have
it
out
with
him
here
and
now
he
had
the
league
letter
about
the
bat
in
his
pocket
he
would
confront
him
with
it
and
insist
on
searching
the
study
there
and
then
if
were
really
as
he
suspected
the
writer
of
the
letter
the
bat
must
be
in
this
room
somewhere
search
it
now
and
he
would
have
no
time
to
hide
it
he
pulled
out
the
letter
i
believe
you
wrote
that
he
said
trevor
was
always
direct
seemed
to
turn
a
little
pale
but
his
voice
when
he
replied
was
quite
steady
that
a
lie
he
said
then
perhaps
said
trevor
you
would
object
to
proving
it
how
by
letting
me
search
your
study
you
do
believe
my
word
why
should
i
you
do
believe
mine
made
no
comment
on
this
remark
was
that
what
you
came
here
for
he
asked
no
said
trevor
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
came
to
tell
you
to
turn
out
for
running
and
passing
with
the
first
tomorrow
afternoon
playing
against
ripton
on
saturday
attitude
underwent
a
complete
transformation
at
the
news
he
became
friendliness
itself
all
right
he
said
i
say
i
sorry
i
said
what
i
did
about
lying
i
was
rather
sick
that
you
should
think
i
wrote
that
rot
you
showed
me
i
hope
you
do
mind
not
a
bit
do
you
mind
my
searching
your
study
for
a
moment
looked
vicious
then
he
sat
down
with
a
laugh
go
on
he
said
i
see
you
do
believe
me
here
are
the
keys
if
you
want
them
trevor
thanked
him
and
took
the
keys
he
opened
every
drawer
and
examined
the
the
bat
was
in
none
of
these
places
he
looked
in
the
cupboards
no
bat
there
like
to
take
up
the
carpet
inquired
no
thanks
search
me
if
you
like
shall
i
turn
out
my
pockets
yes
please
said
trevor
to
his
surprise
he
had
not
expected
to
be
taken
literally
emptied
them
but
the
bat
was
not
there
trevor
turned
to
go
you
not
looked
inside
the
legs
of
the
chairs
yet
said
they
may
be
hollow
there
no
knowing
it
does
matter
thanks
said
trevor
sorry
for
troubling
you
do
forget
tomorrow
afternoon
and
he
went
with
the
very
unpleasant
feeling
that
he
had
been
badly
scored
off
xvi
the
ripton
match
it
was
a
curious
thing
in
connection
with
the
matches
between
ripton
and
wrykyn
that
ripton
always
seemed
to
be
the
bigger
team
they
always
had
a
gigantic
pack
of
forwards
who
looked
capable
of
shoving
a
hole
through
one
of
the
pyramids
possibly
they
looked
bigger
to
the
wrykinians
than
they
really
were
strangers
always
look
big
on
the
football
field
when
you
have
grown
accustomed
to
a
appearance
he
does
not
look
nearly
so
large
milton
for
instance
never
struck
anybody
at
wrykyn
as
being
particularly
big
for
a
school
forward
and
yet
today
he
was
the
heaviest
man
on
the
field
by
a
quarter
of
a
stone
but
taken
in
the
mass
the
ripton
pack
were
far
heavier
than
their
rivals
there
was
a
legend
current
among
the
lower
forms
at
wrykyn
that
fellows
were
allowed
to
stop
on
at
ripton
till
they
were
simply
to
play
football
this
is
scarcely
likely
to
have
been
based
on
fact
few
lower
form
legends
are
jevons
the
ripton
captain
through
having
played
opposite
trevor
for
three
seasons
he
was
the
ripton
left
had
come
to
be
quite
an
intimate
of
his
trevor
had
gone
down
with
milton
and
allardyce
to
meet
the
team
at
the
station
and
conduct
them
up
to
the
school
how
have
you
been
getting
on
since
christmas
asked
jevons
pretty
well
we
lost
paget
i
suppose
you
know
that
was
the
fast
man
on
the
wing
was
it
yes
well
we
lost
a
man
too
oh
yes
that
forward
i
remember
him
it
ought
to
make
us
pretty
even
what
the
ground
like
bit
greasy
i
should
think
we
had
some
rain
late
last
night
the
ground
a
bit
greasy
so
was
the
ball
when
milton
kicked
off
up
the
hill
with
what
wind
there
was
in
his
favour
the
outsides
of
both
teams
found
it
difficult
to
hold
the
ball
jevons
caught
it
on
his
line
and
promptly
handed
it
forward
the
first
scrum
was
formed
in
the
heart
of
the
enemy
country
a
deep
swelling
roar
from
either
greeted
the
advantage
a
feature
of
a
big
match
was
always
the
shouting
it
rarely
ceased
throughout
the
whole
course
of
the
game
the
monotonous
but
impressive
sound
of
five
hundred
voices
all
shouting
the
same
word
it
was
worth
hearing
sometimes
the
evenness
of
the
noise
would
change
to
an
excited
as
a
school
got
off
or
the
school
back
pulled
up
the
attack
with
a
fine
piece
of
defence
sometimes
the
shouting
would
give
place
to
clapping
when
the
school
was
being
pressed
and
somebody
had
found
touch
with
a
long
kick
but
mostly
the
man
on
the
ropes
roared
steadily
and
without
cessation
and
with
the
full
force
of
his
lungs
the
word
the
scrum
was
a
long
one
for
two
minutes
the
forwards
heaved
and
strained
now
one
side
now
the
other
gaining
a
few
inches
the
wrykyn
pack
were
doing
all
they
knew
to
heel
but
their
opponents
superior
weight
was
telling
ripton
had
got
the
ball
and
were
keeping
it
their
game
was
to
break
through
with
it
and
rush
then
suddenly
one
of
their
forwards
kicked
it
on
and
just
at
that
moment
the
opposition
of
the
wrykyn
pack
gave
way
and
the
scrum
broke
up
the
ball
came
out
on
the
wrykyn
side
and
allardyce
whipped
it
out
to
deacon
who
was
playing
half
with
him
ball
out
cried
the
ripton
half
who
was
taking
the
scrum
break
up
it
out
and
his
colleague
on
the
left
darted
across
to
stop
trevor
who
had
taken
deacon
pass
and
was
running
through
on
the
right
trevor
ran
splendidly
he
was
a
who
took
a
lot
of
stopping
when
he
once
got
away
jevons
and
the
ripton
half
met
him
almost
simultaneously
and
each
slackened
his
pace
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
to
allow
the
other
to
tackle
as
they
hesitated
trevor
passed
them
he
had
long
ago
learned
that
to
go
hard
when
you
have
once
started
is
the
thing
that
pays
he
could
see
that
was
racing
up
for
the
pass
and
as
he
reached
the
back
he
sent
the
ball
to
him
then
the
back
got
to
him
and
he
came
down
with
a
thud
with
a
vision
seen
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
of
the
ball
bounding
forward
out
of
the
wing
hands
into
touch
had
bungled
the
pass
in
the
old
familiar
way
and
lost
a
certain
try
the
ran
up
with
his
flag
waving
in
the
air
but
the
referee
had
other
views
knocked
on
inside
he
said
scrum
here
here
was
trevor
saw
with
unspeakable
disgust
some
three
yards
from
the
had
only
had
to
take
the
pass
and
he
must
have
scored
the
ripton
forwards
were
beginning
to
find
their
feet
better
now
and
they
carried
the
scrum
a
warrior
in
one
of
those
which
are
tied
on
by
strings
underneath
the
chin
and
which
add
fifty
per
cent
to
the
ferocity
of
a
forward
appearance
broke
away
with
the
ball
at
his
feet
and
swept
down
the
field
with
the
rest
of
the
pack
at
his
heels
trevor
arrived
too
late
to
pull
up
the
rush
which
had
gone
straight
down
the
right
and
it
was
not
till
strachan
fell
on
the
ball
on
the
wrykyn
line
that
the
danger
ceased
to
threaten
even
now
the
school
were
in
a
bad
way
the
enemy
were
pressing
keenly
and
a
real
piece
of
combination
among
their
would
only
too
probably
end
in
a
try
fortunately
for
them
allardyce
and
deacon
were
a
better
pair
of
halves
than
the
couple
they
were
marking
also
the
ripton
forwards
heeled
slowly
and
allardyce
had
generally
got
his
man
safely
buried
in
the
mud
before
he
could
pass
he
was
just
getting
round
for
the
tenth
time
to
bottle
his
opponent
as
before
when
he
slipped
when
the
ball
came
out
he
was
on
all
fours
and
the
ripton
exponent
finding
to
his
great
satisfaction
that
he
had
not
been
tackled
whipped
the
ball
out
on
the
left
where
a
wing
hovered
this
was
the
man
was
supposed
to
be
marking
and
once
again
did
barry
substitute
prove
of
what
stuff
his
tackling
powers
were
made
after
his
customary
moment
of
hesitation
he
had
at
the
riptonian
neck
the
riptonian
handed
him
off
in
a
manner
that
recalled
the
palmy
days
of
the
old
prize
ring
handing
off
was
always
slightly
vigorous
in
the
ripton
wrykyn
match
and
dashed
over
the
line
in
the
extreme
corner
there
was
anguish
on
the
two
trevor
looked
savage
but
made
no
comment
the
team
lined
up
in
silence
it
takes
a
very
good
kick
to
convert
a
try
from
the
kick
was
a
long
one
but
it
fell
short
ripton
led
by
a
try
to
nothing
a
few
more
scrums
near
the
halfway
line
and
a
fine
attempt
at
a
dropped
goal
by
the
ripton
back
and
it
was
with
the
score
unaltered
during
the
interval
there
were
lemons
an
excellent
thing
is
your
lemon
at
it
cools
the
mouth
quenches
the
thirst
stimulates
the
desire
to
be
at
them
again
and
improves
the
play
possibly
the
wrykyn
team
had
been
happier
in
their
choice
of
lemons
on
this
occasion
for
no
sooner
had
the
game
been
restarted
than
clowes
ran
the
whole
length
of
the
field
dodged
through
the
punted
over
the
back
head
and
scored
a
really
brilliant
try
of
the
sort
that
paget
had
been
fond
of
scoring
in
the
previous
term
the
man
on
the
brightened
up
wonderfully
and
began
to
try
and
calculate
the
probable
score
by
the
end
of
the
game
on
the
assumption
that
as
a
try
had
been
scored
in
the
first
two
minutes
ten
would
be
scored
in
the
first
twenty
and
so
on
but
the
calculations
were
based
on
false
premises
after
strachan
had
failed
to
convert
and
the
game
had
been
resumed
with
the
score
at
one
try
all
play
settled
down
in
the
centre
and
neither
side
could
pierce
the
other
defence
once
jevons
got
off
for
ripton
but
trevor
brought
him
down
safely
and
once
let
his
man
through
as
before
but
strachan
was
there
to
meet
him
and
the
effort
came
to
nothing
for
wrykyn
no
one
did
much
except
tackle
the
forwards
were
beaten
by
the
heavier
pack
and
seldom
let
the
ball
out
allardyce
intercepted
a
pass
when
about
ten
minutes
of
play
remained
and
ran
through
to
the
back
but
the
back
who
was
a
capable
man
and
in
his
third
season
in
the
team
laid
him
low
scientifically
before
he
could
reach
the
line
altogether
it
looked
as
if
the
match
were
going
to
end
in
a
draw
the
wrykyn
defence
with
the
exception
of
was
too
good
to
be
penetrated
while
the
ripton
forwards
by
always
getting
the
ball
in
the
scrums
kept
them
from
attacking
it
was
about
five
minutes
from
the
end
of
the
game
when
the
ripton
right
in
trying
to
punt
across
to
the
wing
miskicked
and
sent
the
ball
straight
into
the
hands
of
trevor
colleague
in
the
centre
before
his
man
could
get
round
to
him
he
had
slipped
through
with
trevor
backing
him
up
the
back
as
a
good
back
should
seeing
two
men
coming
at
him
went
for
the
man
with
the
ball
but
by
the
time
he
had
brought
him
down
the
ball
was
no
longer
where
it
had
originally
been
trevor
had
got
it
and
was
running
in
between
the
posts
this
time
strachan
put
on
the
extra
two
points
without
difficulty
ripton
played
their
hardest
for
the
remaining
minutes
but
without
result
the
game
ended
with
wrykyn
a
goal
ahead
a
goal
and
a
try
to
a
try
for
the
second
time
in
one
season
the
ripton
match
had
ended
in
a
victory
a
thing
it
was
very
rarely
in
the
habit
of
doing
the
senior
at
seymour
rejoiced
considerably
that
night
the
air
was
dark
with
flying
cushions
and
darker
still
occasionally
when
the
usual
humorist
turned
the
gas
out
milton
was
out
for
he
had
gone
to
the
dinner
which
followed
the
ripton
match
and
the
man
in
command
of
the
house
in
his
absence
was
mill
and
the
senior
had
no
respect
whatever
for
mill
barry
joined
in
the
revels
as
well
as
his
ankle
would
let
him
but
he
was
not
feeling
happy
the
disappointment
of
being
out
of
the
first
still
weighed
on
him
at
about
eight
when
things
were
beginning
to
grow
really
lively
and
the
noise
seemed
likely
to
crack
the
window
at
any
moment
the
door
was
flung
open
and
milton
stalked
in
what
all
this
row
he
inquired
stop
it
at
once
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
row
stopped
directly
he
came
in
is
barry
here
he
asked
yes
said
that
youth
congratulate
you
on
your
first
barry
we
just
had
a
meeting
and
given
you
your
colours
trevor
told
me
to
tell
you
xvii
the
watchers
in
the
vault
for
the
next
three
seconds
you
could
have
heard
a
cannonball
drop
and
that
was
equivalent
in
the
senior
at
seymour
to
a
dead
silence
barry
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
leaning
on
the
stick
on
which
he
supported
life
now
that
his
ankle
had
been
injured
and
turned
red
and
white
in
regular
rotation
as
the
magnificence
of
the
news
came
home
to
him
then
the
small
voice
of
linton
was
heard
that
be
six
i
trouble
you
for
young
sammy
said
linton
for
he
had
betted
an
even
sixpence
with
master
samuel
menzies
that
barry
would
get
his
first
fifteen
cap
this
term
and
barry
had
got
it
a
great
shout
went
up
from
every
corner
of
the
room
barry
was
one
of
the
most
popular
members
of
the
house
and
every
one
had
been
sorry
for
him
when
his
sprained
ankle
had
apparently
put
him
out
of
the
running
for
the
last
cap
good
old
barry
said
drummond
delightedly
barry
thanked
him
in
a
dazed
way
every
one
crowded
in
to
shake
his
hand
barry
thanked
then
all
in
a
dazed
way
and
then
the
senior
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
milton
had
returned
gave
itself
up
to
celebrating
the
occasion
with
one
of
the
most
deafening
uproars
that
had
ever
been
heard
even
in
that
factory
of
noise
a
babel
of
voices
discussed
the
match
of
the
afternoon
each
trying
to
outshout
the
other
in
one
corner
linton
was
beating
wildly
on
a
with
part
of
a
broken
chair
shoeblossom
was
busy
in
the
opposite
corner
executing
an
intricate
on
somebody
else
box
had
got
hold
of
the
poker
and
was
burning
his
initials
in
huge
letters
on
the
seat
of
a
chair
every
one
in
short
was
enjoying
himself
and
it
was
not
until
an
advanced
hour
that
comparative
quiet
was
restored
it
was
a
great
evening
for
barry
the
best
he
had
ever
experienced
clowes
did
not
learn
the
news
till
he
saw
it
on
the
on
the
following
monday
when
he
saw
it
he
whistled
softly
i
see
you
given
barry
his
first
he
said
to
trevor
when
they
met
rather
sensational
milton
and
allardyce
both
thought
he
deserved
it
if
he
been
playing
instead
of
they
would
have
scored
at
all
probably
and
we
should
have
got
one
more
try
that
all
right
said
clowes
he
deserves
it
right
enough
and
jolly
glad
you
given
it
him
but
things
will
begin
to
move
now
do
you
think
the
league
ought
to
have
a
word
to
say
about
the
business
it
be
a
facer
for
them
do
you
remember
asked
trevor
saying
that
you
thought
it
must
be
who
wrote
those
letters
yes
well
well
milton
had
an
idea
that
it
was
who
ragged
his
study
what
made
him
think
that
trevor
related
the
shoeblossom
incident
clowes
became
quite
excited
then
must
be
the
man
he
said
why
do
you
go
and
tackle
him
probably
he
got
the
bat
in
his
study
it
not
in
his
study
said
trevor
because
i
looked
everywhere
for
it
and
got
him
to
turn
out
his
pockets
too
and
yet
i
swear
he
knows
something
about
it
one
thing
struck
me
as
a
bit
suspicious
i
went
straight
into
his
study
and
showed
him
that
last
letter
about
the
bat
you
know
and
accused
him
of
writing
it
now
if
he
had
been
in
the
business
somehow
he
would
have
understood
what
was
meant
by
their
saying
bat
you
lost
it
might
have
been
an
ordinary
for
all
he
knew
but
he
offered
to
let
me
search
the
study
it
did
strike
me
as
rum
till
afterwards
then
it
seemed
fishy
what
do
you
think
clowes
thought
so
too
but
admitted
that
he
did
not
see
of
what
use
the
suspicion
was
going
to
be
whether
knew
anything
about
the
affair
or
not
it
was
quite
certain
that
the
bat
was
not
with
him
meanwhile
had
decided
that
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
resume
his
detective
duties
moriarty
agreed
with
him
and
they
resolved
that
that
night
they
would
patronise
the
vault
instead
of
the
gymnasium
and
take
a
holiday
as
far
as
their
boxing
was
concerned
there
was
plenty
of
time
before
the
aldershot
competition
was
still
at
six
so
at
a
quarter
to
that
hour
they
slipped
down
into
the
vault
and
took
up
their
position
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
the
bell
sounded
faintly
moriarty
began
to
grow
tired
is
it
worth
it
he
said
an
would
they
have
come
before
if
they
meant
to
come
we
give
them
another
quarter
of
an
hour
said
after
that
sh
whispered
moriarty
the
door
had
opened
they
could
see
a
figure
dimly
outlined
in
the
footsteps
passed
down
into
the
vault
and
there
came
a
sound
as
if
the
unknown
had
cannoned
into
a
chair
followed
by
a
sharp
intake
of
breath
expressive
of
pain
a
scraping
sound
and
a
flash
of
light
and
part
of
the
vault
was
lit
by
a
candle
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
unknown
face
as
he
rose
from
lighting
the
candle
but
it
was
not
enough
to
enable
him
to
recognise
him
the
candle
was
standing
on
a
chair
and
the
light
it
gave
was
too
feeble
to
reach
the
face
of
any
one
not
on
a
level
with
it
the
unknown
began
to
drag
chairs
out
into
the
neighbourhood
of
the
light
counted
six
the
sixth
chair
had
scarcely
been
placed
in
position
when
the
door
opened
again
six
other
figures
appeared
in
the
opening
one
after
the
other
and
bolted
into
the
vault
like
rabbits
into
a
burrow
the
last
of
them
closed
the
door
after
them
nudged
moriarty
and
moriarty
nudged
but
neither
made
a
sound
they
were
not
likely
to
be
seen
the
blackness
of
the
vault
was
too
egyptian
for
that
but
they
were
so
near
to
the
chairs
that
the
least
whisper
must
have
been
heard
not
a
word
had
proceeded
from
the
occupants
of
the
chairs
so
far
if
suspicion
was
correct
and
this
was
really
the
league
holding
a
meeting
their
methods
were
more
secret
than
those
of
any
other
secret
society
in
existence
even
the
nihilists
probably
exchanged
a
few
remarks
from
time
to
time
when
they
met
together
to
plot
but
these
men
of
mystery
never
opened
their
lips
it
puzzled
the
light
of
the
candle
was
obscured
for
a
moment
and
a
sound
of
puffing
came
from
the
darkness
nudged
moriarty
again
smoking
said
the
nudge
moriarty
nudged
smoking
it
is
was
the
meaning
of
the
movement
a
strong
smell
of
tobacco
showed
that
the
diagnosis
had
been
a
true
one
each
of
the
figures
in
turn
lit
his
pipe
at
the
candle
and
sat
back
still
in
silence
it
could
not
have
been
very
pleasant
smoking
in
almost
pitch
darkness
but
it
was
breaking
rules
which
was
probably
the
main
consideration
that
swayed
the
smokers
they
puffed
away
steadily
till
the
two
irishmen
were
wrapped
about
in
invisible
clouds
then
a
strange
thing
happened
i
know
that
i
am
infringing
copyright
in
making
that
statement
but
it
so
exactly
suits
the
occurrence
that
perhaps
mr
rider
haggard
will
not
object
it
a
strange
thing
that
happened
a
rasping
voice
shattered
the
silence
you
boys
down
there
said
the
voice
come
here
immediately
come
here
i
say
it
was
the
voice
of
mr
robert
dexter
and
beloved
the
two
irishmen
simultaneously
clutched
one
another
each
afraid
that
the
other
would
think
from
force
of
long
habit
that
the
was
speaking
to
him
both
stood
where
they
were
it
was
the
men
of
mystery
and
tobacco
that
dexter
was
after
they
thought
but
they
were
wrong
what
had
brought
dexter
to
the
vault
was
the
fact
that
he
had
seen
two
boys
who
looked
uncommonly
like
and
moriarty
go
down
the
steps
of
the
vault
at
a
quarter
to
six
he
had
been
doing
his
usual
prowl
on
the
junior
gravel
to
intercept
stragglers
and
he
had
been
a
witness
from
a
distance
of
fifty
yards
in
a
very
bad
light
of
the
descent
into
the
vault
he
had
remained
on
the
gravel
ever
since
in
the
hope
of
catching
them
as
they
came
up
but
as
they
had
not
come
up
he
had
determined
to
make
the
first
move
himself
he
had
not
seen
the
six
unknowns
go
down
for
the
evening
being
chilly
he
had
paced
up
and
down
and
they
had
by
a
lucky
accident
chosen
a
moment
when
his
back
was
turned
come
up
immediately
he
repeated
here
a
blast
of
rushed
at
him
from
the
darkness
the
candle
had
been
extinguished
at
the
first
alarm
and
he
had
not
realised
though
he
had
suspected
it
that
smoking
had
been
going
on
a
hurried
whispering
was
in
progress
among
the
unknowns
apparently
they
saw
that
the
game
was
up
for
they
picked
their
way
towards
the
door
as
each
came
up
the
steps
and
passed
him
mr
dexter
observed
ha
and
appeared
to
make
a
note
of
his
name
the
last
of
the
six
was
just
leaving
him
after
this
process
had
been
completed
when
mr
dexter
called
him
back
that
is
not
all
he
said
suspiciously
yes
sir
said
the
last
of
the
unknowns
neither
of
the
irishmen
recognised
the
voice
its
owner
was
a
stranger
to
them
i
tell
you
it
is
not
snapped
mr
dexter
you
are
concealing
the
truth
from
me
and
moriarty
are
down
there
two
boys
in
my
own
house
i
saw
them
go
down
there
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
us
sir
we
saw
nothing
of
them
i
have
no
doubt
said
the
that
you
imagine
that
you
are
doing
a
very
chivalrous
thing
by
trying
to
hide
them
but
you
will
gain
nothing
by
it
you
may
go
he
came
to
the
top
of
the
steps
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
intended
to
plunge
into
the
darkness
in
search
of
the
suspects
but
probably
realising
the
futility
of
such
a
course
he
changed
his
mind
and
delivered
an
ultimatum
from
the
top
step
and
moriarty
no
reply
and
moriarty
i
know
perfectly
well
that
you
are
down
there
come
up
immediately
dignified
silence
from
the
vault
well
i
shall
wait
here
till
you
do
choose
to
come
up
you
would
be
well
advised
to
do
so
immediately
i
warn
you
you
will
not
tire
me
out
he
turned
and
the
door
slammed
behind
him
what
we
do
whispered
moriarty
it
was
at
last
safe
to
whisper
wait
said
i
thinking
thought
for
many
minutes
he
thought
in
vain
at
last
there
came
flooding
back
into
his
mind
a
memory
of
the
days
of
his
faghood
it
was
after
that
that
he
had
been
groping
all
the
time
he
remembered
now
once
in
those
days
there
had
been
an
unexpected
function
in
the
middle
of
term
there
were
needed
for
that
function
certain
chairs
he
could
recall
even
now
his
furious
disgust
when
he
and
a
select
body
of
fellow
fags
had
been
pounced
upon
by
their
and
coerced
into
forming
a
line
from
the
junior
block
to
the
cloisters
for
the
purpose
of
handing
chairs
true
his
had
stood
after
the
event
with
princely
liberality
but
the
labour
was
of
the
sort
that
gallons
of
will
not
make
pleasant
but
he
ceased
to
regret
the
episode
now
he
had
been
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
chain
he
had
stood
in
a
passage
in
the
junior
block
just
by
the
door
that
led
to
the
masters
garden
and
which
he
remembered
was
never
locked
till
late
at
night
and
while
he
stood
there
a
pair
of
hands
apparently
without
a
body
had
heaved
up
chair
after
chair
through
a
black
opening
in
the
floor
in
other
words
a
connected
with
the
vault
in
which
he
now
was
he
imparted
these
reminiscences
of
childhood
to
moriarty
they
set
off
to
search
for
the
missing
door
and
after
wanderings
and
barkings
of
shins
too
painful
to
relate
they
found
it
moriarty
lit
a
match
the
light
fell
on
the
and
their
last
doubts
were
at
an
end
the
thing
opened
inwards
the
bolt
was
on
their
side
not
in
the
passage
above
them
to
shoot
the
bolt
took
them
one
second
to
climb
into
the
passage
one
minute
they
stood
at
the
side
of
the
opening
and
dusted
their
clothes
bedad
said
moriarty
suddenly
what
why
how
are
we
to
shut
it
this
was
a
problem
that
wanted
some
solving
eventually
they
managed
it
leaning
over
and
fishing
for
it
while
moriarty
held
his
legs
as
luck
would
have
it
and
luck
had
stood
by
them
well
all
through
there
was
a
bolt
on
top
of
the
as
well
as
beneath
it
supposing
that
had
been
shot
said
as
they
fastened
the
door
in
its
place
moriarty
did
not
care
to
suppose
anything
so
unpleasant
mr
dexter
was
still
prowling
about
on
the
junior
gravel
when
the
two
irishmen
ran
round
and
across
the
senior
gravel
to
the
gymnasium
here
they
put
in
a
few
minutes
gentle
sparring
and
then
marched
boldly
up
to
mr
day
who
happened
to
have
looked
in
five
minutes
after
their
arrival
and
got
their
paper
what
time
did
and
moriarty
arrive
at
the
gymnasium
asked
mr
dexter
of
mr
day
next
morning
and
moriarty
really
i
ca
remember
i
know
they
at
about
a
quarter
to
seven
that
profound
thinker
mr
tony
weller
was
never
so
correct
as
in
his
views
respecting
the
value
of
an
there
are
few
better
things
in
an
emergency
xviii
excels
himself
it
was
renford
turn
next
morning
to
get
up
and
feed
the
ferrets
harvey
had
done
it
the
day
before
renford
was
not
a
youth
who
enjoyed
early
rising
but
in
the
cause
of
the
ferrets
he
would
have
endured
anything
so
at
six
punctually
he
slid
out
of
bed
dressed
quietly
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
rest
of
the
dormitory
and
ran
over
to
the
vault
to
his
utter
amazement
he
found
it
locked
such
a
thing
had
never
been
done
before
in
the
whole
course
of
his
experience
he
tugged
at
the
handle
but
not
an
inch
or
a
fraction
of
an
inch
would
the
door
yield
the
policy
of
the
open
door
had
ceased
to
find
favour
in
the
eyes
of
the
authorities
a
feeling
of
blank
despair
seized
upon
him
he
thought
of
the
dismay
of
the
ferrets
when
they
woke
up
and
realised
that
there
was
no
chance
of
breakfast
for
them
and
then
they
would
gradually
waste
away
and
some
day
somebody
would
go
down
to
the
vault
to
fetch
chairs
and
would
come
upon
two
mouldering
skeletons
and
wonder
what
they
had
once
been
he
almost
wept
at
the
vision
so
conjured
up
there
was
nobody
about
perhaps
he
might
break
in
somehow
but
then
there
was
nothing
to
get
to
work
with
he
could
not
kick
the
door
down
no
he
must
give
it
up
and
the
ferrets
must
be
postponed
possibly
harvey
might
be
able
to
think
of
something
fed
inquired
harvey
when
they
met
at
breakfast
no
i
could
why
on
earth
not
you
did
oversleep
yourself
renford
poured
his
tale
into
his
friend
shocked
ears
my
hat
said
harvey
when
he
had
finished
what
on
earth
are
we
to
do
they
starve
renford
nodded
mournfully
whatever
made
them
go
and
lock
the
door
he
said
he
seemed
to
think
the
authorities
should
have
given
him
due
notice
of
such
an
action
you
sure
they
have
locked
it
it
is
only
stuck
or
something
i
lugged
at
the
handle
for
hours
but
you
can
go
and
see
for
yourself
if
you
like
harvey
went
and
waiting
till
the
coast
was
clear
attached
himself
to
the
handle
with
a
prehensile
grasp
and
put
his
back
into
one
strenuous
tug
it
was
even
as
renford
had
said
the
door
was
locked
beyond
possibility
of
doubt
renford
and
he
went
over
to
school
that
morning
with
long
faces
and
a
general
air
of
acute
depression
it
was
perhaps
fortunate
for
their
purpose
that
they
did
for
had
their
appearance
been
normal
it
might
not
have
attracted
attention
as
it
was
the
irishman
meeting
them
on
the
junior
gravel
stopped
and
asked
them
what
was
wrong
since
the
adventure
in
the
vault
he
had
felt
an
interest
in
renford
and
harvey
the
two
told
their
story
in
alternate
sentences
like
the
strophe
and
antistrophe
of
a
greek
chorus
steichomuthics
your
greek
scholar
calls
it
i
fancy
ha
yes
just
so
so
ye
ca
get
in
because
they
locked
the
door
an
ye
do
know
what
to
do
about
it
said
at
the
conclusion
of
the
narrative
renford
and
harvey
informed
him
in
chorus
that
that
the
state
of
the
game
up
to
present
date
an
ye
want
me
to
get
them
out
for
you
neither
had
dared
to
hope
that
he
would
go
so
far
as
this
what
they
had
looked
for
had
been
at
the
most
a
few
thoughtful
words
of
advice
that
such
a
as
should
take
up
their
cause
was
an
unexampled
piece
of
good
luck
if
you
only
would
said
harvey
we
should
be
most
awfully
obliged
said
renford
very
well
said
they
thanked
him
profusely
replied
that
it
would
be
a
privilege
he
should
be
sorry
he
said
to
have
anything
happen
to
the
ferrets
renford
and
harvey
went
on
into
school
feeling
more
cheerful
if
the
ferrets
could
be
extracted
from
their
present
tight
corner
was
the
man
to
do
it
had
not
made
his
offer
of
assistance
in
any
spirit
of
doubt
he
was
certain
that
he
could
do
what
he
had
promised
for
it
had
not
escaped
his
memory
that
this
was
a
tuesday
in
other
words
a
mathematics
morning
up
to
the
quarter
to
eleven
interval
that
meant
as
has
been
explained
previously
that
while
the
rest
of
the
school
were
in
the
he
would
be
out
in
the
passage
if
he
cared
to
be
there
would
be
no
witnesses
to
what
he
was
going
to
do
but
by
that
curious
perversity
of
fate
which
is
so
often
noticeable
mr
banks
was
in
a
peculiarly
and
mood
this
morning
actions
for
which
would
on
other
days
have
been
expelled
from
the
room
without
hope
of
return
today
were
greeted
with
a
mild
do
do
that
please
or
even
the
ridiculously
inadequate
it
was
perfectly
disheartening
began
to
ask
himself
bitterly
what
was
the
use
of
ragging
at
all
if
this
was
how
it
was
received
and
the
moments
were
flying
and
his
promise
to
renford
and
harvey
still
remained
unfulfilled
he
prepared
for
fresh
efforts
so
desperate
was
he
that
he
even
resorted
to
crude
methods
like
the
throwing
of
paper
balls
and
the
dropping
of
books
and
when
your
really
scientific
ragger
sinks
to
this
he
is
nearing
the
end
of
his
tether
hated
to
be
rude
but
there
seemed
no
help
for
it
the
striking
of
a
quarter
past
ten
improved
his
chances
it
had
been
privily
agreed
upon
beforehand
amongst
the
members
of
the
class
that
at
a
quarter
past
ten
every
one
was
to
sneeze
simultaneously
the
noise
startled
mr
banks
considerably
the
angelic
mood
began
to
wear
off
a
man
may
be
but
he
likes
to
draw
the
line
somewhere
another
exhibition
like
that
he
said
sharply
and
the
class
stays
in
after
school
sir
silence
i
said
nothing
sir
really
boy
you
made
a
noise
with
your
mouth
what
of
noise
sir
the
form
waited
breathlessly
this
peculiarly
insidious
question
had
been
invented
for
mathematical
use
by
one
sandys
who
had
left
at
the
end
of
the
previous
summer
it
was
but
rarely
that
the
master
increased
the
gaiety
of
nations
by
answering
the
question
in
the
manner
desired
mr
banks
off
his
guard
fell
into
the
trap
a
noise
like
this
he
said
curtly
and
to
the
delighted
audience
came
the
melodious
sound
of
a
which
put
effort
completely
in
the
shade
and
would
have
challenged
comparison
with
the
of
the
stoutest
mouser
that
ever
trod
a
tile
a
storm
of
imitations
arose
from
all
parts
of
the
room
mr
banks
turned
pink
and
going
straight
to
the
root
of
the
disturbance
forthwith
evicted
left
with
the
satisfying
feeling
that
his
duty
had
been
done
mr
banks
room
was
at
the
top
of
the
middle
block
he
ran
softly
down
the
stairs
at
his
best
pace
it
was
not
likely
that
the
master
would
come
out
into
the
passage
to
see
if
he
was
still
there
but
it
might
happen
and
it
would
be
best
to
run
as
few
risks
as
possible
he
sprinted
over
to
the
junior
block
raised
the
and
jumped
down
he
knew
where
the
ferrets
had
been
placed
and
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
them
in
another
minute
he
was
in
the
passage
again
with
the
bolted
behind
him
he
now
asked
himself
what
should
he
do
with
them
he
must
find
a
safe
place
or
his
labours
would
have
been
in
vain
behind
the
he
thought
would
be
the
spot
nobody
ever
went
there
it
meant
a
run
of
three
hundred
yards
there
and
the
same
distance
back
and
there
was
more
than
a
chance
that
he
might
be
seen
by
one
of
the
powers
in
which
case
he
might
find
it
rather
hard
to
explain
what
he
was
doing
in
the
middle
of
the
grounds
with
a
couple
of
ferrets
in
his
possession
when
the
hands
of
the
clock
pointed
to
twenty
minutes
to
eleven
but
the
odds
were
against
his
being
seen
he
risked
it
when
the
bell
rang
for
the
quarter
to
eleven
interval
the
ferrets
were
in
their
new
home
happily
discussing
a
piece
of
meat
contribution
held
over
from
the
morning
meal
and
looking
as
if
he
had
never
left
the
passage
for
an
instant
was
making
his
way
through
the
departing
mathematical
class
to
apologise
handsomely
to
mr
banks
as
was
his
invariable
custom
for
his
disgraceful
behaviour
during
the
morning
lesson
xix
the
mayor
visit
school
prefects
at
wrykyn
did
weekly
essays
for
the
headmaster
those
who
had
got
their
scholarships
at
the
or
who
were
going
up
in
the
following
year
used
to
take
their
essays
to
him
after
school
and
read
them
to
him
an
unpopular
and
practice
akin
to
suicide
trevor
had
got
his
scholarship
in
the
previous
november
he
was
due
at
the
headmaster
private
house
at
six
on
the
present
tuesday
he
was
looking
forward
to
the
ordeal
not
without
apprehension
the
essay
subject
this
week
had
been
one
man
meat
is
another
poison
and
clowes
whose
idea
of
english
essay
was
that
it
should
be
a
medium
for
intempestive
frivolity
had
insisted
on
his
beginning
with
while
i
can
not
conscientiously
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
one
man
meat
is
another
man
poison
yet
i
am
certainly
of
opinion
that
what
is
highly
beneficial
to
one
man
may
on
the
other
hand
to
another
man
differently
constituted
be
extremely
deleterious
and
indeed
absolutely
fatal
trevor
was
not
at
all
sure
how
the
headmaster
would
take
it
but
clowes
had
seemed
so
cut
up
at
his
suggestion
that
it
had
better
be
omitted
that
he
had
allowed
it
to
stand
he
was
putting
the
final
polish
on
this
gem
of
english
literature
at
five
when
milton
came
in
busy
said
milton
trevor
said
he
would
be
through
in
a
minute
milton
took
a
chair
and
waited
trevor
scratched
out
two
words
and
substituted
two
others
made
a
couple
of
picturesque
blots
and
laying
down
his
pen
announced
that
he
had
finished
what
up
he
said
it
about
the
league
said
milton
found
out
anything
not
anything
much
but
i
been
making
inquiries
you
remember
i
asked
you
to
let
me
look
at
those
letters
of
yours
trevor
nodded
this
had
happened
on
the
sunday
of
that
week
well
i
wanted
to
look
at
the
by
jove
i
never
thought
of
that
milton
continued
with
the
air
of
the
detective
who
explains
in
the
last
chapter
of
the
book
how
he
did
it
i
found
as
i
thought
that
both
letters
came
from
the
same
place
trevor
pulled
out
the
letters
in
question
so
they
do
he
said
chesterton
do
you
know
chesterton
asked
milton
only
by
name
it
a
small
hamlet
about
two
miles
from
here
across
the
downs
there
only
one
shop
in
the
place
which
acts
as
and
tobacconist
and
everything
else
i
thought
that
if
i
went
there
and
asked
about
those
letters
they
might
remember
who
it
was
that
sent
them
if
i
showed
them
a
photograph
by
jove
said
trevor
of
course
did
you
what
happened
i
went
there
yesterday
afternoon
i
took
about
photographs
of
various
chaps
including
but
wait
a
bit
if
chesterton
two
miles
off
have
sent
the
letters
he
would
have
the
time
after
school
he
was
on
the
grounds
both
the
afternoons
before
i
got
the
letters
i
know
said
milton
i
did
think
of
that
at
the
time
well
one
of
the
points
about
the
chesterton
is
that
there
no
outside
you
have
to
go
into
the
shop
and
hand
anything
you
want
to
post
across
the
counter
i
thought
this
was
a
tremendous
score
for
me
i
thought
they
would
be
bound
to
remember
who
handed
in
the
letters
there
ca
be
many
at
a
place
like
that
did
they
remember
they
remembered
the
letters
being
given
in
distinctly
but
as
for
knowing
anything
beyond
that
they
were
simply
futile
there
was
an
old
woman
in
the
shop
aged
about
three
hundred
and
ten
i
should
think
i
should
say
she
had
ever
been
very
intelligent
but
now
she
simply
gibbered
i
started
off
by
laying
out
a
shilling
on
some
sweets
i
gave
the
lot
to
a
village
kid
when
i
got
out
i
hope
they
did
kill
him
then
having
scattered
in
that
way
i
lugged
out
the
photographs
mentioned
the
letters
and
the
date
they
had
been
sent
and
asked
her
to
weigh
in
and
identify
the
sender
did
she
my
dear
chap
she
identified
them
all
one
after
the
other
the
first
was
one
of
clowes
she
was
prepared
to
swear
on
oath
that
that
was
the
chap
who
had
sent
the
letters
then
i
shot
a
photograph
of
you
across
the
counter
and
doubts
began
to
creep
in
she
said
she
was
certain
it
was
one
of
those
two
but
could
quite
say
which
to
keep
her
amused
i
fired
in
photograph
number
three
allardyce
she
identified
that
too
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
she
was
pretty
sure
that
it
was
one
of
the
six
the
other
three
were
paget
clephane
and
but
she
was
not
going
to
bind
herself
down
to
any
particular
one
as
i
had
come
to
the
end
of
my
stock
of
photographs
and
was
getting
a
bit
sick
of
the
game
i
got
up
to
go
when
in
came
another
ornament
of
chesterton
from
a
room
at
the
back
of
the
shop
he
was
quite
a
kid
not
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
at
the
outside
so
as
a
last
chance
i
tackled
him
on
the
subject
he
looked
at
the
photographs
for
about
half
an
hour
mumbling
something
about
it
not
being
or
or
tother
until
i
began
to
feel
i
had
enough
of
it
then
it
came
out
that
the
real
chap
who
had
sent
the
letters
was
a
with
light
hair
not
so
big
as
me
that
does
help
us
much
said
and
a
little
gennlemun
so
all
we
got
to
do
is
to
look
for
some
young
duke
of
polished
manners
and
exterior
with
a
thatch
of
light
hair
there
are
three
hundred
and
fellows
with
light
hair
in
the
school
said
trevor
calmly
thought
it
was
three
hundred
and
myself
said
milton
but
i
may
be
wrong
anyhow
there
you
have
the
results
of
my
investigations
if
you
can
make
anything
out
of
them
you
welcome
to
it
half
a
second
said
trevor
as
he
got
up
had
the
fellow
a
cap
of
any
sort
no
bareheaded
you
would
expect
him
to
give
himself
away
by
wearing
a
trevor
went
over
to
the
headmaster
revolving
this
discovery
in
his
mind
it
was
not
much
of
a
clue
but
the
smallest
clue
is
better
than
nothing
to
find
out
that
the
sender
of
the
league
letters
had
fair
hair
narrowed
the
search
down
a
little
it
cleared
the
more
members
of
the
school
at
any
rate
besides
by
combining
his
information
with
milton
the
search
might
be
still
further
narrowed
down
he
knew
that
the
polite
must
be
either
in
seymour
or
in
donaldson
the
number
of
youths
in
the
two
houses
was
not
excessive
indeed
at
the
moment
he
could
not
recall
any
which
rather
complicated
matters
he
arrived
at
the
headmaster
door
and
knocked
he
was
shown
into
a
room
at
the
side
of
the
hall
near
the
door
the
butler
informed
him
that
the
headmaster
was
engaged
at
present
trevor
who
knew
the
butler
slightly
through
having
constantly
been
to
see
the
headmaster
on
business
the
front
door
asked
who
was
there
sir
eustace
briggs
said
the
butler
and
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
his
lair
beyond
the
green
baize
partition
at
the
end
of
the
hall
trevor
went
into
the
room
which
was
a
sort
of
spare
study
and
sat
down
wondering
what
had
brought
the
mayor
of
wrykyn
to
see
the
headmaster
at
this
advanced
hour
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
sound
of
voices
broke
in
upon
his
peace
the
headmaster
was
coming
down
the
hall
with
the
intention
of
showing
his
visitor
out
the
door
of
trevor
room
was
ajar
and
he
could
hear
distinctly
what
was
being
said
he
had
no
particular
desire
to
play
the
eavesdropper
but
the
part
was
forced
upon
him
sir
eustace
seemed
excited
it
is
far
from
being
my
habit
he
was
saying
to
make
unnecessary
complaints
respecting
the
conduct
of
the
lads
under
your
care
sir
eustace
briggs
had
a
distaste
for
the
shorter
and
more
colloquial
forms
of
speech
he
would
have
perished
sooner
than
have
substituted
complain
of
your
boys
for
the
majestic
formula
he
had
used
he
spoke
as
if
he
enjoyed
choosing
his
words
he
seemed
to
pause
and
think
before
each
word
unkind
people
who
were
jealous
of
his
distinguished
career
used
to
say
that
he
did
this
because
he
was
afraid
of
dropping
an
aitch
if
he
relaxed
his
vigilance
but
continued
he
i
am
reluctantly
forced
to
the
unpleasant
conclusion
that
the
dastardly
outrage
to
which
both
i
and
the
press
of
the
town
have
called
your
attention
is
to
be
attributed
to
one
of
the
lads
to
whom
i
this
with
a
jerk
referred
i
will
make
a
thorough
inquiry
sir
eustace
said
the
bass
voice
of
the
headmaster
i
thank
you
said
the
mayor
it
would
under
the
circumstances
be
nothing
more
i
think
than
what
is
distinctly
advisable
the
man
samuel
wapshott
of
whose
narrative
i
have
recently
afforded
you
a
brief
synopsis
stated
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
he
found
at
the
foot
of
the
statue
on
which
the
dastardly
outrage
was
perpetrated
a
diminutive
ornament
in
shape
like
the
bats
that
are
used
in
the
game
of
cricket
this
ornament
he
avers
with
what
truth
i
know
not
was
handed
by
him
to
a
youth
of
an
age
coeval
with
that
of
the
lads
in
the
upper
division
of
this
school
the
youth
claimed
it
as
his
property
i
was
given
to
understand
a
thorough
inquiry
shall
be
made
sir
eustace
i
thank
you
and
then
the
door
shut
and
the
conversation
ceased
xx
the
finding
of
the
bat
trevor
waited
till
the
headmaster
had
gone
back
to
his
library
gave
him
five
minutes
to
settle
down
and
then
went
in
the
headmaster
looked
up
inquiringly
my
essay
sir
said
trevor
ah
yes
i
had
forgotten
trevor
opened
the
notebook
and
began
to
read
what
he
had
written
he
finished
the
paragraph
which
owed
its
insertion
to
clowes
and
raced
hurriedly
on
to
the
next
to
his
surprise
the
flippancy
passed
unnoticed
at
any
rate
verbally
as
a
rule
the
headmaster
preferred
that
quotations
from
back
numbers
of
should
be
kept
out
of
the
prefects
english
essays
and
he
generally
said
as
much
but
today
he
seemed
strangely
preoccupied
a
split
infinitive
in
paragraph
five
which
at
other
times
would
have
made
him
sit
up
in
his
chair
stiff
with
horror
elicited
no
remark
the
same
immunity
was
accorded
to
the
insertion
inspired
by
clowes
as
usual
of
a
popular
catch
phrase
in
the
last
few
lines
trevor
finished
with
the
feeling
that
luck
had
favoured
him
nobly
yes
said
the
headmaster
seemingly
roused
by
the
silence
following
on
the
conclusion
of
the
essay
yes
then
after
a
long
pause
yes
again
trevor
said
nothing
but
waited
for
further
comment
yes
said
the
headmaster
once
more
i
think
that
is
a
very
fair
essay
very
fair
it
wants
a
little
more
er
not
quite
so
much
um
yes
trevor
made
a
note
in
his
mind
to
effect
these
improvements
in
future
essays
and
was
getting
up
when
the
headmaster
stopped
him
do
go
trevor
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
trevor
first
thought
was
perhaps
naturally
that
the
bat
was
going
to
be
brought
into
discussion
he
was
wondering
helplessly
how
he
was
going
to
keep
and
his
midnight
exploit
out
of
the
conversation
when
the
headmaster
resumed
an
unpleasant
thing
has
happened
trevor
now
we
coming
to
it
thought
trevor
it
appears
trevor
that
a
considerable
amount
of
smoking
has
been
going
on
in
the
school
trevor
breathed
freely
once
more
it
was
only
going
to
be
a
mere
conventional
smoking
row
after
all
he
listened
with
more
enjoyment
as
the
headmaster
having
stopped
to
turn
down
the
wick
of
the
which
stood
on
the
table
at
his
side
and
which
had
begun
appropriately
enough
to
smoke
resumed
his
discourse
mr
dexter
of
course
thought
trevor
if
there
ever
was
a
row
in
the
school
dexter
was
bound
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
mr
dexter
has
just
been
in
to
see
me
he
reported
six
boys
he
discovered
them
in
the
vault
beneath
the
junior
block
two
of
them
were
boys
in
your
house
trevor
murmured
something
wordless
to
show
that
the
story
interested
him
you
knew
nothing
of
this
of
course
no
sir
no
of
course
not
it
is
difficult
for
the
head
of
a
house
to
know
all
that
goes
on
in
that
house
was
this
his
beastly
sarcasm
trevor
asked
himself
but
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
not
after
all
the
head
of
a
house
is
only
human
he
can
not
be
expected
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
private
life
of
every
member
of
his
house
this
must
be
stopped
trevor
there
is
no
saying
how
widespread
the
practice
has
become
or
may
become
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
go
straight
back
to
your
house
and
begin
a
complete
search
of
the
studies
tonight
sir
it
seemed
too
late
for
such
amusement
tonight
but
before
you
go
to
your
house
call
at
mr
seymour
and
tell
milton
i
should
like
to
see
him
and
trevor
yes
sir
you
will
understand
that
i
am
leaving
this
matter
to
you
to
be
dealt
with
by
you
i
shall
not
require
you
to
make
any
report
to
me
but
if
you
should
find
tobacco
in
any
boy
room
you
must
punish
him
well
trevor
punish
him
well
this
meant
that
the
culprit
must
be
touched
up
before
the
house
assembled
in
the
such
an
event
did
not
often
occur
the
last
occasion
had
been
in
paget
first
term
as
head
of
donaldson
when
two
of
the
senior
had
been
discovered
attempting
to
revive
the
ancient
and
dishonourable
custom
of
bullying
this
time
trevor
foresaw
would
set
up
a
record
in
all
probability
there
might
be
any
number
of
devotees
of
the
weed
and
he
meant
to
carry
out
his
instructions
to
the
full
and
make
the
criminals
more
unhappy
than
they
had
been
since
the
day
of
their
first
cigar
trevor
hated
the
habit
of
smoking
at
school
he
was
so
intensely
keen
on
the
success
of
the
house
and
the
school
at
games
that
anything
which
tended
to
damage
the
wind
and
eye
filled
him
with
loathing
that
anybody
should
dare
to
smoke
in
a
house
which
was
going
to
play
in
the
final
for
the
house
football
cup
made
him
rage
internally
and
he
proposed
to
make
things
bad
and
unrestful
for
such
to
smoke
at
school
is
to
insult
the
divine
weed
when
you
are
obliged
to
smoke
in
odd
corners
fearing
every
moment
that
you
will
be
discovered
the
whole
meaning
poetry
romance
of
a
pipe
vanishes
and
you
become
like
those
lost
beings
who
smoke
when
they
are
running
to
catch
trains
the
boy
who
smokes
at
school
is
bound
to
come
to
a
bad
end
he
will
degenerate
gradually
into
a
person
that
plays
dominoes
in
the
of
shops
with
friends
who
wear
bowler
hats
and
frock
coats
much
of
this
philosophy
trevor
expounded
to
clowes
in
energetic
language
when
he
returned
to
donaldson
after
calling
at
seymour
to
deliver
the
message
for
milton
clowes
became
quite
animated
at
the
prospect
of
a
real
row
we
shall
be
able
to
see
the
skeletons
in
their
cupboards
he
observed
every
man
has
a
skeleton
in
his
cupboard
which
follows
him
about
wherever
he
goes
which
study
shall
we
go
to
first
we
said
trevor
we
repeated
clowes
firmly
i
am
not
going
to
be
left
out
of
this
jaunt
i
need
bracing
up
i
not
strong
you
know
and
this
is
just
the
thing
to
do
it
besides
you
want
a
bodyguard
of
some
sort
in
case
the
infuriated
occupant
turns
and
rends
you
i
do
see
what
there
is
to
enjoy
in
the
business
said
trevor
gloomily
personally
i
bar
this
kind
of
thing
by
the
time
finished
there
wo
be
a
chap
in
the
house
i
on
speaking
terms
with
except
me
dearest
said
clowes
i
will
never
desert
you
it
of
no
use
asking
me
for
i
will
never
do
it
mr
micawber
has
his
faults
but
i
will
desert
mr
micawber
you
can
come
if
you
like
said
trevor
we
take
the
studies
in
order
i
suppose
we
need
look
up
the
prefects
a
prefect
is
above
suspicion
scratch
the
prefects
that
brings
us
to
dixon
dixon
was
a
stout
youth
with
spectacles
who
was
popularly
supposed
to
do
hours
work
a
day
it
was
believed
that
he
put
in
two
hours
sleep
from
eleven
to
one
and
then
got
up
and
worked
in
his
study
till
breakfast
he
was
working
when
clowes
and
trevor
came
in
he
dived
head
foremost
into
a
huge
liddell
and
scott
as
the
door
opened
on
hearing
voice
he
slowly
emerged
and
a
pair
of
round
and
spectacled
eyes
gazed
blankly
at
the
visitors
trevor
briefly
explained
his
errand
but
the
interview
lost
in
solemnity
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
bare
notion
of
dixon
storing
tobacco
in
his
room
made
clowes
roar
with
laughter
also
dixon
stolidly
refused
to
understand
what
trevor
was
talking
about
and
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
finding
it
hopeless
to
try
and
explain
the
two
went
dixon
with
a
hazy
impression
that
he
had
been
asked
to
join
in
some
sort
of
round
game
and
had
refused
the
offer
returned
again
to
his
liddell
and
scott
and
continued
to
wrestle
with
the
somewhat
obscure
utterances
of
the
chorus
in
aeschylus
the
results
of
this
fiasco
on
trevor
and
clowes
were
widely
different
trevor
it
depressed
horribly
it
made
him
feel
savage
clowes
on
the
other
hand
regarded
the
whole
affair
in
a
spirit
of
rollicking
farce
and
refused
to
see
that
this
was
a
serious
matter
in
which
the
honour
of
the
house
was
involved
the
next
study
was
ruthven
this
fact
somewhat
toned
down
the
exuberances
of
clowes
demeanour
when
one
particularly
dislikes
a
person
one
has
a
curious
objection
to
seeming
in
good
spirits
in
his
presence
one
feels
that
he
may
take
it
as
a
sort
of
compliment
to
himself
or
at
any
rate
contribute
grins
of
his
own
which
would
be
hateful
clowes
was
as
grave
as
trevor
when
they
entered
the
study
ruthven
study
was
like
himself
overdressed
and
rather
futile
it
ran
to
little
china
ornaments
in
a
good
deal
of
profusion
it
was
more
like
a
than
a
school
study
sorry
to
disturb
you
ruthven
said
trevor
oh
come
in
said
ruthven
in
a
tired
voice
please
shut
the
door
there
is
a
draught
do
you
want
anything
we
got
to
have
a
look
round
said
clowes
ca
you
see
everything
there
is
ruthven
hated
clowes
as
much
as
clowes
hated
him
trevor
cut
into
the
conversation
again
it
like
this
ruthven
he
said
i
awfully
sorry
but
the
old
man
just
told
me
to
search
the
studies
in
case
any
of
the
fellows
have
got
baccy
ruthven
jumped
up
pale
with
consternation
you
ca
i
wo
have
you
disturbing
my
study
this
is
rot
said
trevor
shortly
i
got
to
it
no
good
making
it
more
unpleasant
for
me
than
it
is
but
i
no
tobacco
i
swear
i
have
then
why
mind
us
searching
said
clowes
affably
come
on
ruthven
said
trevor
chuck
us
over
the
keys
you
might
as
well
i
wo
do
be
an
ass
man
we
have
here
observed
clowes
in
his
sad
solemn
way
a
stout
and
serviceable
poker
he
stooped
as
he
spoke
to
pick
it
up
leave
that
poker
alone
cried
ruthven
clowes
straightened
himself
i
swop
it
for
your
keys
he
said
do
be
a
fool
very
well
then
we
will
now
crack
our
first
crib
ruthven
sprang
forward
but
clowes
handing
him
off
in
football
fashion
with
his
left
hand
with
his
right
dashed
the
poker
against
the
lock
of
the
drawer
of
the
table
by
which
he
stood
the
lock
broke
with
a
sharp
crack
it
was
not
built
with
an
eye
to
such
onslaught
neat
for
a
first
shot
said
clowes
complacently
now
for
the
umustaphas
and
shag
but
as
he
looked
into
the
drawer
he
uttered
a
sudden
cry
of
excitement
he
drew
something
out
and
tossed
it
over
to
trevor
catch
trevor
he
said
quietly
something
that
interest
you
trevor
caught
it
neatly
in
one
hand
and
stood
staring
at
it
as
if
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
and
yet
he
had
often
for
what
he
had
caught
was
a
little
golden
bat
about
an
inch
long
by
an
eighth
of
an
inch
wide
xxi
the
league
revealed
what
do
you
think
of
that
said
clowes
trevor
said
nothing
he
could
not
quite
grasp
the
situation
it
was
not
only
that
he
had
got
the
idea
so
firmly
into
his
head
that
it
was
who
had
sent
the
letters
and
appropriated
the
bat
even
supposing
he
had
not
suspected
he
would
never
have
dreamed
of
suspecting
ruthven
they
had
been
friends
not
very
close
friends
trevor
keenness
for
games
and
ruthven
dislike
of
them
prevented
that
but
a
good
deal
more
than
acquaintances
he
was
so
constituted
that
he
could
not
grasp
the
frame
of
mind
required
for
such
an
action
as
ruthven
it
was
something
absolutely
abnormal
clowes
was
equally
surprised
but
for
a
different
reason
it
was
not
so
much
the
enormity
of
ruthven
proceedings
that
took
him
aback
he
believed
him
with
that
cheerful
intolerance
which
a
certain
type
of
mind
affects
capable
of
anything
what
surprised
him
was
the
fact
that
ruthven
had
had
the
ingenuity
and
even
the
daring
to
conduct
a
campaign
of
this
description
cribbing
in
examinations
he
would
have
thought
the
limit
of
his
crimes
something
backboneless
and
underhand
of
that
kind
would
not
have
surprised
him
in
the
least
he
would
have
said
that
it
was
just
about
what
he
had
expected
all
along
but
that
ruthven
should
blossom
out
suddenly
as
quite
an
ingenious
and
capable
criminal
in
this
way
was
a
complete
surprise
well
perhaps
make
a
remark
he
said
turning
to
ruthven
ruthven
looking
very
much
like
a
passenger
on
a
channel
steamer
who
has
just
discovered
that
the
motion
of
the
vessel
is
affecting
him
unpleasantly
had
fallen
into
a
chair
when
clowes
handed
him
off
he
sat
there
with
a
look
on
his
pasty
face
which
was
not
good
to
see
as
silent
as
trevor
it
seemed
that
whatever
conversation
there
was
going
to
be
would
have
to
take
the
form
of
a
soliloquy
from
clowes
clowes
took
a
seat
on
the
corner
of
the
table
it
seems
to
me
ruthven
he
said
that
you
better
say
at
present
there
a
lot
that
wants
explaining
as
this
bat
has
been
found
lying
in
your
drawer
i
suppose
we
may
take
it
that
you
the
impolite
ruthven
found
his
voice
at
last
i
not
he
cried
i
never
wrote
a
line
now
we
getting
at
it
said
clowes
i
thought
you
could
have
had
it
in
you
to
carry
this
business
through
on
your
own
apparently
you
only
been
the
sleeping
partner
in
this
show
though
i
suppose
it
was
you
who
ragged
trevor
study
not
much
sleeping
about
that
you
took
over
the
acting
branch
of
the
concern
for
that
day
only
i
expect
was
it
you
who
ragged
the
study
ruthven
stared
into
the
fire
but
said
nothing
must
be
polite
you
know
ruthven
and
answer
when
you
spoken
to
was
it
you
who
ragged
trevor
study
yes
said
ruthven
thought
so
why
of
course
i
met
you
just
outside
said
trevor
speaking
for
the
first
time
you
were
the
chap
who
told
me
what
had
happened
ruthven
said
nothing
the
ragging
of
the
study
seems
to
have
been
all
the
active
work
he
did
remarked
clowes
no
said
trevor
he
posted
the
letters
whether
he
wrote
them
or
not
milton
was
telling
me
you
remember
i
told
you
no
i
did
milton
found
out
that
the
letters
were
posted
by
a
small
fellow
that
him
said
clowes
as
regardless
of
grammar
as
the
monks
of
rheims
pointing
with
the
poker
at
ruthven
immaculate
locks
well
you
ragged
the
study
and
posted
the
letters
that
was
all
your
share
am
i
right
in
thinking
was
the
other
partner
silence
from
ruthven
am
i
persisted
clowes
you
may
think
what
you
like
i
do
care
now
we
getting
rude
again
complained
clowes
in
this
yes
said
ruthven
thought
so
and
who
else
no
one
try
again
i
tell
you
there
was
no
one
else
ca
you
believe
a
word
a
chap
says
a
word
here
and
there
perhaps
said
clowes
as
one
making
a
concession
but
not
many
and
this
is
one
of
them
have
another
shot
ruthven
relapsed
into
silence
all
right
then
said
clowes
we
accept
that
statement
just
a
chance
that
it
may
be
true
and
that
about
all
i
think
this
is
my
affair
at
all
really
it
yours
trevor
i
only
a
spectator
and
it
your
business
you
find
me
in
my
study
and
putting
the
poker
carefully
in
its
place
clowes
left
the
room
he
went
into
his
study
and
tried
to
begin
some
work
but
the
beauties
of
the
second
book
of
thucydides
failed
to
appeal
to
him
his
mind
was
elsewhere
he
felt
too
excited
with
what
had
just
happened
to
translate
greek
he
pulled
up
a
chair
in
front
of
the
fire
and
gave
himself
up
to
speculating
how
trevor
was
getting
on
in
the
neighbouring
study
he
was
glad
he
had
left
him
to
finish
the
business
if
he
had
been
in
trevor
place
there
was
nothing
he
would
so
greatly
have
disliked
as
to
have
some
one
however
familiar
a
friend
interfering
in
his
wars
and
settling
them
for
him
left
to
himself
clowes
would
probably
have
ended
the
interview
by
kicking
ruthven
into
the
nearest
approach
to
pulp
compatible
with
the
laws
relating
to
manslaughter
he
had
an
uneasy
suspicion
that
trevor
would
let
him
down
far
too
easily
the
handle
turned
trevor
came
in
and
pulled
up
another
chair
in
silence
his
face
wore
a
look
of
disgust
but
there
were
no
signs
of
combat
upon
him
the
toe
of
his
boot
was
not
worn
and
battered
as
clowes
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
it
evidently
he
had
not
chosen
to
adopt
active
and
physical
measures
for
the
improvement
of
moral
well
said
clowes
my
word
what
a
hound
breathed
trevor
half
to
himself
my
sentiments
to
a
hair
said
clowes
approvingly
but
what
have
you
done
i
did
do
anything
i
was
afraid
you
would
did
he
give
any
explanation
what
made
him
go
in
for
the
thing
at
all
what
earthly
motive
could
he
have
for
not
wanting
barry
to
get
his
colours
bar
the
fact
that
want
him
to
and
why
should
he
do
what
told
him
i
never
even
knew
they
were
pals
before
today
he
told
me
a
good
deal
said
trevor
it
one
of
the
beastliest
things
i
ever
heard
they
neither
of
them
come
particularly
well
out
of
the
business
but
comes
worse
out
of
it
even
than
ruthven
my
word
that
man
wants
killing
that
keep
said
clowes
nodding
what
the
yarn
do
you
remember
about
a
year
ago
a
chap
named
patterson
getting
sacked
clowes
nodded
again
he
remembered
the
case
well
patterson
had
had
gambling
transactions
with
a
wrykyn
tradesman
had
been
found
out
and
had
gone
you
remember
what
a
surprise
it
was
to
everybody
it
was
one
of
those
cases
where
half
the
school
suspects
what
going
on
those
cases
always
come
out
sooner
or
later
but
patterson
nobody
knew
about
yes
well
nobody
said
trevor
except
ruthven
that
is
ruthven
got
to
know
somehow
i
believe
he
was
a
bit
of
a
pal
of
patterson
at
the
time
anyhow
they
had
a
row
and
ruthven
went
to
dexter
patterson
was
in
dexter
and
sneaked
dexter
promised
to
keep
his
name
out
of
the
business
and
went
straight
to
the
old
man
and
patterson
got
turfed
out
on
the
spot
then
somehow
or
other
got
to
know
about
it
i
believe
ruthven
must
have
told
him
by
accident
some
time
or
other
after
that
he
simply
had
to
do
everything
wanted
him
to
otherwise
he
said
that
he
would
tell
the
chaps
about
the
patterson
affair
that
put
ruthven
in
a
dead
funk
of
course
said
clowes
i
should
imagine
friend
ruthven
would
have
got
rather
a
bad
time
of
it
but
what
made
them
think
of
starting
the
league
it
was
a
jolly
smart
idea
of
course
yes
i
suppose
he
heard
about
it
and
thought
something
might
be
made
out
of
it
if
it
were
revived
and
were
ruthven
and
he
the
only
two
in
it
ruthven
swears
they
were
and
i
should
wonder
if
he
was
telling
the
truth
for
once
in
his
life
you
see
everything
the
league
done
so
far
could
have
been
done
by
him
and
without
anybody
else
help
the
only
other
studies
that
were
ragged
were
mill
and
milton
both
in
seymour
yes
said
clowes
there
was
a
pause
clowes
put
another
shovelful
of
coal
on
the
fire
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
ruthven
nothing
nothing
hang
it
he
does
deserve
to
get
off
like
that
he
is
as
bad
as
quite
but
he
pretty
nearly
as
finished
a
little
beast
as
you
could
find
finished
is
just
the
word
said
trevor
he
going
at
the
end
of
the
week
going
what
sacked
yes
the
old
man
been
finding
out
things
about
him
apparently
and
this
smoking
row
has
just
added
the
to
his
discoveries
he
particularly
keen
against
smoking
just
now
for
some
reason
but
was
ruthven
in
it
yes
did
i
tell
you
he
was
one
of
the
fellows
dexter
caught
in
the
vault
there
were
two
in
this
house
you
remember
who
was
the
other
that
man
dashwood
has
the
study
next
to
paget
old
one
he
going
too
scarcely
knew
him
what
sort
of
a
chap
was
he
outsider
no
good
to
the
house
in
any
way
he
wo
be
missed
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
fight
him
of
course
what
else
could
i
do
but
you
no
match
for
him
we
see
but
you
persisted
clowes
he
can
give
you
a
stone
easily
and
he
not
a
bad
boxer
either
moriarty
did
beat
him
so
very
cheaply
in
the
this
year
you
would
have
a
chance
trevor
flared
up
heavens
man
he
cried
do
you
think
i
do
know
all
that
myself
but
what
on
earth
would
you
have
me
do
besides
he
may
be
a
good
boxer
but
he
got
no
pluck
at
all
i
might
outstay
him
hope
so
said
clowes
but
his
tone
was
not
hopeful
xxii
a
dress
rehearsal
some
people
in
trevor
place
might
have
taken
the
earliest
opportunity
of
confronting
so
as
to
settle
the
matter
in
hand
without
delay
trevor
thought
of
doing
this
but
finally
decided
to
let
the
matter
rest
for
a
day
until
he
should
have
found
out
with
some
accuracy
what
chance
he
stood
after
four
therefore
on
the
next
day
having
had
tea
in
his
study
he
went
across
to
the
baths
in
search
of
he
intended
that
before
the
evening
was
over
the
irishman
should
have
imparted
to
him
some
of
his
skill
with
the
hands
he
did
not
know
that
for
a
man
absolutely
unscientific
with
his
fists
there
is
nothing
so
fatal
as
to
take
a
boxing
lesson
on
the
eve
of
battle
a
little
knowledge
is
a
dangerous
thing
he
is
apt
to
lose
his
recklessness
which
might
have
stood
by
him
well
in
exchange
for
a
little
quite
useless
science
he
is
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
neither
a
natural
fighter
nor
a
skilful
boxer
this
point
endeavoured
to
press
upon
him
as
soon
as
he
had
explained
why
it
was
that
he
wanted
coaching
on
this
particular
afternoon
the
irishman
was
in
the
gymnasium
punching
the
ball
when
trevor
found
him
he
generally
put
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
the
every
evening
before
moriarty
turned
up
for
the
customary
six
rounds
want
me
to
teach
ye
a
few
tricks
he
said
what
that
for
i
got
a
mill
coming
on
soon
explained
trevor
trying
to
make
the
statement
as
if
it
were
the
most
ordinary
thing
in
the
world
for
a
school
prefect
who
was
also
captain
of
football
head
of
a
house
and
in
the
cricket
eleven
to
be
engaged
for
a
fight
in
the
near
future
mill
exclaimed
you
an
why
never
mind
why
said
trevor
i
tell
you
afterwards
perhaps
shall
i
put
on
the
gloves
now
wait
said
i
must
do
my
quarter
of
an
hour
with
the
ball
before
i
begin
teaching
other
people
how
to
box
have
ye
a
watch
yes
then
time
me
i
do
four
rounds
of
three
minutes
each
with
a
minute
rest
in
between
that
more
than
i
do
at
aldershot
but
it
get
me
fit
ready
time
said
trevor
he
watched
assailing
the
swinging
ball
with
considerable
envy
why
he
wondered
had
he
not
gone
in
for
boxing
everybody
ought
to
learn
to
box
it
was
bound
to
come
in
useful
some
time
or
other
take
his
own
case
he
was
very
much
afraid
no
afraid
was
not
the
right
word
for
he
was
not
that
he
was
very
much
of
opinion
that
was
going
to
have
a
most
enjoyable
time
when
they
met
and
the
final
was
to
be
played
next
monday
if
events
turned
out
as
he
could
not
help
feeling
they
were
likely
to
turn
out
he
would
be
too
battered
to
play
in
that
match
donaldson
would
probably
win
whether
he
played
or
not
but
it
would
be
bitter
to
be
laid
up
on
such
an
occasion
on
the
other
hand
he
must
go
through
with
it
he
did
not
believe
in
letting
other
people
take
a
hand
in
settling
his
private
quarrels
but
he
wished
he
had
learned
to
box
if
only
he
could
hit
that
dancing
jumping
ball
with
a
fifth
of
the
skill
that
was
displaying
his
wiriness
and
pluck
might
see
him
through
finished
his
fourth
round
with
his
leathern
opponent
and
sat
down
panting
pretty
useful
that
commented
trevor
admiringly
ye
should
see
moriarty
gasped
now
will
ye
tell
me
why
it
is
you
going
to
fight
and
with
whom
you
going
to
fight
very
well
it
with
exclaimed
but
me
dearr
man
he
ate
you
trevor
gave
a
rather
annoyed
laugh
i
must
say
i
got
a
nice
cheery
comforting
lot
of
friends
he
said
that
just
what
clowes
has
been
trying
to
explain
to
me
clowes
is
quite
right
said
seriously
has
the
thing
gone
too
far
for
ye
to
back
out
without
climbing
down
of
course
he
added
yes
said
trevor
there
no
question
of
my
getting
out
of
it
i
daresay
i
could
in
fact
i
know
i
could
but
i
not
going
to
but
me
dearr
man
ye
have
an
earthly
chance
i
assure
ye
ye
have
i
seen
with
the
gloves
on
that
was
last
term
he
not
put
them
on
since
moriarty
bate
him
in
the
middles
so
he
may
be
out
of
practice
but
even
then
he
be
a
bad
man
to
tackle
he
big
an
he
strong
an
if
he
only
had
the
heart
in
him
he
have
been
going
up
to
aldershot
instead
of
moriarty
that
what
he
be
doing
an
you
ca
box
at
all
never
even
had
the
gloves
on
never
i
used
to
scrap
when
i
was
a
kid
though
that
no
use
said
decidedly
but
you
have
said
what
it
is
that
ye
got
against
what
is
it
i
do
see
why
i
should
tell
you
you
in
it
as
well
in
fact
if
it
had
been
for
the
bat
turning
up
you
have
been
considerably
more
in
it
than
i
am
what
cried
where
did
you
find
it
was
it
in
the
grounds
when
was
it
you
found
it
whereupon
trevor
gave
him
a
very
full
and
exact
account
of
what
had
happened
he
showed
him
the
two
letters
from
the
league
touched
on
milton
connection
with
the
affair
traced
the
gradual
development
of
his
suspicions
and
described
with
some
approach
to
excitement
the
scene
in
ruthven
study
and
the
explanations
that
had
followed
it
now
do
you
wonder
he
concluded
that
i
feel
as
if
a
few
rounds
with
would
do
me
good
breathed
hard
my
word
he
said
i
like
to
see
ye
kill
him
but
said
trevor
as
you
and
clowes
have
been
pointing
out
to
me
if
there
going
to
be
a
corpse
it
be
me
however
i
mean
to
try
now
perhaps
you
would
mind
showing
me
a
few
tricks
take
my
advice
said
and
do
try
any
of
that
foolery
why
i
thought
you
were
such
a
believer
in
science
said
trevor
in
surprise
so
i
am
if
you
enough
of
it
but
it
the
worst
thing
ye
can
do
to
learn
a
trick
or
two
just
before
a
fight
if
you
do
know
anything
about
the
game
already
a
tough
rushing
fighter
is
ten
times
as
good
as
a
man
who
just
begun
to
learn
what
he
ought
to
do
well
what
do
you
advise
me
to
do
then
asked
trevor
impressed
by
the
unwonted
earnestness
with
which
the
irishman
delivered
this
pugilistic
homily
which
was
a
paraphrase
of
the
views
dinned
into
the
ears
of
every
novice
by
the
school
instructor
i
must
do
something
the
best
thing
ye
can
do
said
thinking
for
a
moment
is
to
put
on
the
gloves
and
have
a
round
or
two
with
me
here
moriarty
at
last
we
get
him
to
time
us
as
much
explanation
as
was
thought
good
for
him
having
been
given
to
the
newcomer
to
account
for
trevor
taste
for
things
pugilistic
moriarty
took
the
watch
with
instructions
to
give
them
two
minutes
for
the
first
round
go
as
hard
as
you
can
said
to
trevor
as
they
faced
one
another
and
hit
as
hard
as
you
like
it
wo
be
any
practice
if
you
do
i
mind
being
hit
it
do
me
good
for
aldershot
see
trevor
said
he
saw
time
said
moriarty
trevor
went
in
with
a
will
he
was
a
little
shy
at
first
of
putting
all
his
weight
into
his
blows
it
was
hard
to
forget
that
he
felt
friendly
towards
but
he
speedily
awoke
to
the
fact
that
the
irishman
took
his
boxing
very
seriously
and
was
quite
a
different
person
when
he
had
the
gloves
on
when
he
was
so
equipped
the
man
opposite
him
ceased
to
be
either
friend
or
foe
in
a
private
way
he
was
simply
an
opponent
and
every
time
he
hit
him
was
one
point
and
when
he
entered
the
ring
his
only
object
in
life
for
the
next
three
minutes
was
to
score
points
consequently
trevor
sparring
lightly
and
in
rather
a
futile
manner
at
first
was
woken
up
by
a
stinging
flush
hit
between
the
eyes
after
that
he
too
forgot
that
he
liked
the
man
before
him
and
rushed
him
in
all
directions
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
who
would
have
won
if
it
had
been
a
competition
trevor
guard
was
of
the
most
rudimentary
order
and
got
through
when
and
how
he
liked
but
though
he
took
a
good
deal
he
also
gave
a
good
deal
and
confessed
himself
not
altogether
sorry
when
moriarty
called
time
man
he
said
regretfully
why
ever
did
ye
not
take
up
boxing
before
ye
have
made
a
splendid
well
have
i
a
chance
do
you
think
inquired
trevor
ye
might
do
it
with
luck
said
very
doubtfully
but
he
added
i
afraid
ye
not
much
chance
and
with
this
poor
encouragement
from
his
trainer
and
trevor
was
forced
to
be
content
xxiii
what
renford
saw
the
health
of
master
harvey
of
seymour
was
so
delicately
constituted
that
it
was
an
absolute
necessity
that
he
should
consume
one
or
more
hot
buns
during
the
quarter
of
an
hour
interval
which
split
up
morning
school
he
was
tearing
across
the
junior
gravel
towards
the
shop
on
the
morning
following
trevor
sparring
practice
with
when
a
melodious
treble
voice
called
his
name
it
was
renford
he
stopped
to
allow
his
friend
to
come
up
with
him
and
then
made
as
if
to
resume
his
way
to
the
shop
but
renford
proposed
an
amendment
do
go
to
the
shop
he
said
i
want
to
talk
well
ca
you
talk
in
the
shop
not
what
i
want
to
tell
you
it
private
come
for
a
stroll
harvey
hesitated
there
were
few
things
he
enjoyed
so
much
as
exclusive
items
of
school
gossip
scandal
preferably
but
hot
new
buns
were
among
those
few
things
however
he
decided
on
this
occasion
to
feed
the
mind
at
the
expense
of
the
body
he
accepted
renford
invitation
what
is
it
he
asked
as
they
made
for
the
football
field
been
happening
it
frightfully
exciting
said
renford
what
up
you
must
tell
any
one
all
right
of
course
not
well
then
there
been
a
big
fight
and
i
one
of
the
only
chaps
who
know
about
it
so
far
a
fight
harvey
became
excited
who
between
renford
paused
before
delivering
his
news
to
emphasise
the
importance
of
it
it
was
between
and
he
said
at
length
jove
said
harvey
then
a
suspicion
crept
into
his
mind
look
here
renford
he
said
if
you
trying
to
green
me
i
not
you
ass
replied
renford
indignantly
it
perfectly
true
i
saw
it
myself
by
jove
did
you
really
where
was
it
when
did
it
come
off
was
it
a
good
one
who
won
it
was
the
best
one
i
ever
seen
did
beat
him
i
hope
he
did
a
jolly
good
sort
yes
they
had
six
rounds
got
knocked
out
in
the
middle
of
the
sixth
what
do
you
mean
really
knocked
out
or
did
he
just
chuck
it
no
he
was
really
knocked
out
he
was
on
the
floor
for
quite
a
time
by
jove
you
should
have
seen
it
was
ripping
in
the
sixth
round
he
was
all
over
him
tell
us
about
it
said
harvey
and
renford
told
i
got
up
early
he
said
to
feed
the
ferrets
and
i
was
just
cutting
over
to
the
with
their
grub
when
just
as
i
got
across
the
senior
gravel
i
saw
and
moriarty
standing
waiting
near
the
second
court
knows
all
about
the
ferrets
so
i
try
and
cut
or
anything
i
went
up
and
began
talking
to
him
i
noticed
he
did
look
particularly
keen
on
seeing
me
at
first
i
asked
him
if
he
was
going
to
play
fives
then
he
said
no
and
told
me
what
really
come
for
he
said
he
and
had
had
a
row
and
agreed
to
have
it
out
that
morning
in
one
of
the
of
course
when
i
heard
that
i
was
all
on
to
see
it
so
i
said
i
wait
if
he
did
mind
he
said
he
did
care
so
long
as
i
did
tell
everybody
so
i
said
i
would
tell
anybody
except
you
so
he
said
all
right
then
i
could
stop
if
i
wanted
to
so
that
was
how
i
saw
it
well
after
we
been
waiting
a
few
minutes
came
in
sight
with
that
beast
merrett
in
our
house
who
come
to
second
him
it
was
just
like
one
of
those
duels
you
read
about
you
know
then
said
that
as
i
was
the
only
one
there
with
a
watch
he
and
were
in
footer
clothes
and
merrett
and
moriarty
had
got
their
tickers
on
them
i
better
act
as
timekeeper
so
i
said
all
right
i
would
and
we
went
to
the
second
it
the
biggest
of
them
you
know
i
stood
outside
on
the
bench
looking
through
the
wire
netting
over
the
door
so
as
not
to
be
in
the
way
when
they
started
scrapping
and
took
off
their
blazers
and
sweaters
and
chucked
them
to
moriarty
and
merrett
and
then
moriarty
and
merrett
went
and
stood
in
two
corners
and
and
walked
into
the
middle
and
stood
up
to
one
another
was
miles
the
heaviest
by
a
stone
i
should
think
and
he
was
taller
and
had
a
longer
reach
but
looked
much
fitter
looked
rather
flabby
i
sang
out
through
the
wire
netting
and
they
started
off
at
once
offered
to
shake
hands
but
would
so
they
began
without
it
the
first
round
was
awfully
fast
they
kept
having
long
rallies
all
over
the
place
was
a
jolly
sight
quicker
and
seem
able
to
guard
his
hits
at
all
but
he
hit
frightfully
hard
himself
great
heavy
slogs
and
kept
getting
them
in
the
face
at
last
he
got
one
bang
in
the
mouth
which
knocked
him
down
flat
he
was
up
again
in
a
second
and
was
starting
to
rush
when
i
looked
at
the
watch
and
found
that
i
given
them
nearly
half
a
minute
too
much
already
so
i
shouted
and
made
up
my
mind
i
keep
more
of
an
eye
on
the
watch
next
round
i
got
so
jolly
excited
watching
them
that
i
forgot
i
was
supposed
to
be
keeping
time
for
them
they
had
only
asked
for
a
minute
between
the
rounds
but
as
i
given
them
half
a
minute
too
long
in
the
first
round
i
chucked
in
a
bit
extra
in
the
rest
so
that
they
were
both
pretty
fit
by
the
time
i
started
them
again
the
second
round
was
just
like
the
first
and
so
was
the
third
kept
getting
the
worst
of
it
he
was
knocked
down
three
or
four
times
more
and
once
when
he
rushed
against
one
of
the
walls
he
hit
out
and
missed
and
barked
his
knuckles
jolly
badly
against
the
wall
that
was
in
the
middle
of
the
third
round
and
had
it
all
his
own
way
for
the
rest
of
the
round
for
about
two
minutes
that
is
to
say
he
hit
about
all
over
the
shop
i
was
so
jolly
keen
on
winning
that
i
had
half
a
mind
to
call
time
early
so
as
to
give
him
time
to
recover
but
i
thought
it
would
be
a
low
thing
to
do
so
i
gave
them
their
full
three
minutes
directly
they
began
the
fourth
round
i
noticed
that
things
were
going
to
change
a
bit
had
given
up
his
rushing
game
and
was
waiting
for
his
man
and
when
he
came
at
him
he
put
in
a
hot
counter
nearly
always
at
the
body
after
a
bit
began
to
get
cautious
and
would
rush
so
the
fourth
round
was
the
quietest
there
had
been
in
the
last
minute
they
did
hit
each
other
at
all
they
simply
sparred
for
openings
it
was
in
the
fifth
round
that
began
to
forge
ahead
about
half
way
through
he
got
in
a
ripper
right
in
the
wind
which
almost
doubled
up
and
then
he
started
rushing
again
looked
awfully
bad
at
the
end
of
the
round
round
six
was
ripping
i
never
saw
two
chaps
go
for
each
other
so
it
was
one
long
rally
then
how
it
happened
i
could
see
they
were
so
quick
just
as
they
had
been
at
it
a
minute
and
a
half
there
was
a
crack
and
the
next
thing
i
saw
was
on
the
ground
looking
beastly
he
went
down
absolutely
flat
his
heels
and
head
touched
the
ground
at
the
same
time
i
counted
ten
out
loud
in
the
professional
way
like
they
do
at
the
national
sporting
club
you
know
and
then
said
wins
i
felt
an
awful
swell
after
about
another
was
all
right
again
and
he
got
up
and
went
back
to
the
house
with
merrett
and
and
moriarty
went
off
to
dexter
and
i
gave
the
ferrets
their
grub
and
cut
back
to
breakfast
was
at
breakfast
said
harvey
no
he
went
to
bed
i
wonder
what
happen
think
there
be
a
row
about
it
should
think
so
said
harvey
they
never
do
make
rows
about
fights
and
neither
of
them
is
a
prefect
so
i
do
see
what
it
matters
if
they
fight
but
i
say
what
up
i
wish
said
harvey
his
voice
full
of
acute
regret
that
it
had
been
my
turn
to
feed
those
ferrets
i
do
said
renford
cheerfully
i
would
have
missed
that
mill
for
something
hullo
there
the
bell
we
better
run
when
trevor
called
at
seymour
that
afternoon
to
see
with
a
view
to
challenging
him
to
deadly
combat
and
found
that
had
been
before
him
he
ought
to
have
felt
relieved
his
actual
feeling
was
one
of
acute
annoyance
it
seemed
to
him
that
had
exceeded
the
limits
of
friendship
it
was
all
very
well
for
him
to
take
over
the
contract
and
settle
it
himself
in
order
to
save
trevor
from
a
very
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
but
trevor
was
one
of
those
people
who
object
strongly
to
the
interference
of
other
people
in
their
private
business
he
sought
out
and
complained
within
two
minutes
golden
eloquence
had
soothed
him
and
made
him
view
the
matter
in
quite
a
different
light
what
pointed
out
was
that
it
was
not
trevor
affair
at
all
but
his
own
who
he
asked
had
been
likely
to
be
damaged
most
by
manoeuvres
in
connection
with
the
lost
bat
trevor
was
bound
to
admit
that
was
that
person
very
well
then
said
then
who
had
a
better
right
to
fight
and
trevor
confessed
that
no
one
else
had
a
better
then
i
suppose
he
said
that
i
shall
have
to
do
nothing
about
it
that
it
said
it
be
rather
beastly
meeting
the
man
after
this
said
trevor
presently
do
you
think
he
might
possibly
leave
at
the
end
of
term
he
leaving
at
the
end
of
the
week
said
he
was
one
of
the
fellows
dexter
caught
in
the
vault
that
evening
you
wo
see
much
more
of
i
try
and
put
up
with
that
said
trevor
and
so
will
i
replied
and
i
should
think
milton
would
be
so
very
grieved
no
said
trevor
i
tell
you
what
will
make
him
sick
though
and
that
is
your
having
milled
with
it
a
job
he
have
liked
to
have
taken
on
himself
xxiv
conclusion
into
the
story
at
this
point
comes
the
narrative
of
charles
mereweather
cook
aged
fourteen
a
cook
arrived
at
the
school
on
the
tenth
of
march
at
precisely
nine
in
a
state
of
excitement
he
said
there
was
a
row
on
in
the
town
he
said
there
was
no
end
of
a
row
on
in
the
town
during
morning
school
he
explained
further
whispering
his
tale
into
the
attentive
ear
of
knight
of
the
school
house
who
sat
next
to
him
what
sort
of
a
row
knight
wanted
to
know
cook
deposed
that
he
had
been
riding
on
his
bicycle
past
the
entrance
to
the
recreation
grounds
on
his
way
to
school
when
his
eye
was
attracted
by
the
movements
of
a
mass
of
men
just
inside
the
gate
they
appeared
to
be
fighting
witness
did
not
stop
to
watch
much
as
he
would
have
liked
to
do
so
why
not
why
because
he
was
late
already
and
would
have
had
to
scorch
anyhow
in
order
to
get
to
school
in
time
and
he
had
been
late
the
day
before
and
was
afraid
that
old
appleby
the
master
of
the
form
would
give
him
beans
if
he
were
late
again
wherefore
he
had
no
notion
of
what
the
men
were
fighting
about
but
he
betted
that
more
would
be
heard
about
it
why
because
from
what
he
saw
of
it
it
seemed
a
jolly
big
thing
there
must
have
been
quite
three
hundred
men
fighting
knight
satirically
it
on
well
quite
a
hundred
anyhow
fifty
a
side
and
fighting
like
anything
he
betted
there
would
be
something
about
it
in
the
tomorrow
he
should
wonder
if
somebody
had
been
killed
what
were
they
scrapping
about
how
should
know
here
mr
appleby
who
had
been
trying
for
the
last
five
minutes
to
find
out
where
the
whispering
noise
came
from
at
length
traced
it
to
its
source
and
forthwith
requested
messrs
cook
and
knight
to
do
him
two
hundred
lines
adding
that
if
he
heard
them
talking
again
he
would
put
them
into
the
extra
lesson
silence
reigned
from
that
moment
next
day
while
the
form
was
wrestling
with
the
moderately
exciting
account
of
caesar
doings
in
gaul
master
cook
produced
from
his
pocket
a
newspaper
cutting
this
having
previously
planted
a
forcible
blow
in
his
friend
ribs
with
an
elbow
to
attract
the
attention
he
handed
to
knight
and
in
dumb
show
requested
him
to
peruse
the
same
which
knight
feeling
no
interest
whatever
in
doings
in
gaul
and
having
in
consequence
a
good
deal
of
time
on
his
hands
proceeded
to
do
the
cutting
was
headed
disgraceful
fracas
and
was
written
in
the
elegant
style
that
was
always
so
marked
a
feature
of
the
we
are
sorry
to
have
to
report
it
ran
another
of
those
deplorable
ebullitions
of
local
hooliganism
to
which
it
has
before
now
been
our
painful
duty
to
refer
yesterday
the
recreation
grounds
were
made
the
scene
of
as
brutal
an
exhibition
of
savagery
as
has
ever
marred
the
fair
fame
of
this
town
our
readers
will
remember
how
on
a
previous
occasion
when
the
fine
statue
of
sir
eustace
briggs
was
found
covered
with
tar
we
attributed
the
act
to
the
malevolence
of
the
radical
section
of
the
community
events
have
proved
that
we
were
right
yesterday
a
body
of
youths
belonging
to
the
rival
party
was
discovered
in
the
very
act
of
repeating
the
offence
a
thick
coating
of
tar
had
already
been
administered
when
several
members
of
the
rival
faction
appeared
a
free
fight
of
a
peculiarly
violent
nature
immediately
ensued
with
the
result
that
before
the
police
could
interfere
several
of
the
combatants
had
received
severe
bruises
fortunately
the
police
then
arrived
on
the
scene
and
with
great
difficulty
succeeded
in
putting
a
stop
to
the
several
arrests
were
made
we
have
no
desire
to
discourage
legitimate
party
rivalry
but
we
feel
justified
in
strongly
protesting
against
such
dastardly
tricks
as
those
to
which
we
have
referred
we
can
assure
our
opponents
that
they
can
gain
nothing
by
such
conduct
there
was
a
good
deal
more
to
the
effect
that
now
was
the
time
for
all
good
men
to
come
to
the
aid
of
the
party
and
that
the
constituents
of
sir
eustace
briggs
must
look
to
it
that
they
failed
not
in
the
hour
of
need
and
so
on
that
was
what
the
had
to
say
on
the
subject
managed
to
get
hold
of
a
copy
of
the
paper
and
showed
it
to
clowes
and
trevor
so
now
he
said
it
all
right
ye
see
they
never
suspect
it
was
the
same
people
that
tarred
the
statue
both
times
an
ye
got
the
bat
back
so
it
all
right
ye
see
the
only
thing
that
trouble
you
now
said
clowes
will
be
your
conscience
intimated
that
he
would
try
and
put
up
with
that
but
is
it
a
stroke
of
luck
he
said
that
they
should
have
gone
and
tarred
sir
eustace
again
so
soon
after
moriarty
and
i
did
it
clowes
said
gravely
that
it
only
showed
the
force
of
good
example
yes
they
would
have
thought
of
it
if
it
had
been
for
us
chortled
i
wonder
now
if
there
anything
else
we
could
do
to
that
statue
he
added
meditatively
my
good
lunatic
said
clowes
do
you
think
you
done
almost
enough
for
one
term
well
replied
thoughtfully
perhaps
we
have
i
suppose
the
term
wore
on
donaldson
won
the
final
by
a
matter
of
points
it
was
as
they
had
expected
one
of
the
easiest
games
they
had
had
to
play
in
the
competition
bryant
who
were
their
opponents
were
not
strong
and
had
only
managed
to
get
into
the
final
owing
to
their
luck
in
drawing
weak
opponents
for
the
trial
heats
the
real
final
that
had
decided
the
ownership
of
the
cup
had
been
donaldson
seymour
aldershot
arrived
and
the
sports
drummond
and
covered
themselves
with
glory
and
brought
home
silver
medals
but
moriarty
to
the
disappointment
of
the
school
which
had
counted
on
his
pulling
off
the
middles
met
a
strenuous
gentleman
from
st
paul
in
the
final
and
was
prematurely
outed
in
the
first
minute
of
the
third
round
to
him
therefore
there
fell
but
a
medal
of
bronze
it
was
on
the
sunday
after
the
sports
that
trevor
connection
with
the
bat
ceased
as
far
that
is
to
say
as
concerned
its
unpleasant
character
as
a
piece
of
evidence
that
might
be
used
to
his
disadvantage
he
had
gone
to
supper
with
the
headmaster
accompanied
by
clowes
and
milton
the
headmaster
nearly
always
invited
a
few
of
the
house
prefects
to
sunday
supper
during
the
term
sir
eustace
briggs
happened
to
be
there
he
had
withdrawn
his
insinuations
concerning
the
part
supposedly
played
by
a
member
of
the
school
in
the
matter
of
the
tarred
statue
and
the
headmaster
had
sealed
the
by
asking
him
to
supper
an
ordinary
man
might
have
considered
it
best
to
keep
off
the
delicate
subject
not
so
sir
eustace
briggs
he
was
on
to
it
like
glue
he
talked
of
little
else
throughout
the
whole
course
of
the
meal
my
suspicions
he
boomed
towards
the
conclusion
of
the
feast
which
have
i
am
rejoiced
to
say
proved
so
entirely
void
of
foundation
and
significance
were
aroused
in
the
first
instance
as
i
mentioned
before
by
the
narrative
of
the
man
samuel
wapshott
nobody
present
showed
the
slightest
desire
to
learn
what
the
man
samuel
wapshott
had
had
to
say
for
himself
but
sir
eustace
undismayed
continued
as
if
the
whole
table
were
hanging
on
his
words
the
man
samuel
wapshott
he
said
distinctly
asserted
that
a
small
gold
ornament
shaped
like
a
bat
was
handed
by
him
to
a
lad
of
age
coeval
with
these
lads
here
the
headmaster
interposed
he
had
evidently
heard
more
than
enough
of
the
man
samuel
wapshott
he
must
have
been
mistaken
he
said
briefly
the
bat
which
trevor
is
wearing
on
his
at
this
moment
is
the
only
one
of
its
kind
that
i
know
of
you
have
never
lost
it
trevor
trevor
thought
for
a
moment
had
never
lost
it
he
replied
diplomatically
it
has
been
in
a
drawer
nearly
all
the
term
sir
he
said
a
drawer
hey
remarked
sir
eustace
briggs
ah
a
very
sensible
place
to
keep
it
in
my
boy
you
could
have
no
better
place
in
my
opinion
and
trevor
agreed
with
him
with
the
mental
reservation
that
it
rather
depended
on
whom
the
drawer
belonged
to
