to
madame
zulma
carraud
to
whom
madame
but
to
you
should
i
inscribe
this
work
to
you
whose
lofty
and
candid
intellect
is
a
treasury
to
your
friends
to
you
that
are
to
me
not
only
a
whole
public
but
the
most
indulgent
of
sisters
as
well
will
you
deign
to
accept
a
token
of
the
friendship
of
which
i
am
proud
you
and
some
few
souls
as
noble
will
grasp
the
whole
of
the
thought
underlying
firm
of
appended
to
is
there
not
a
whole
social
lesson
in
the
contrast
between
the
two
stories
de
balzac
the
firm
of
nucingen
you
know
how
slight
the
partitions
are
between
the
private
rooms
of
fashionable
restaurants
in
paris
very
s
largest
room
for
instance
is
cut
in
two
by
a
removable
screen
this
scene
is
laid
at
very
s
but
in
snug
quarters
which
for
reasons
of
my
own
i
forbear
to
specify
we
were
two
so
i
will
say
like
henri
monnier
s
prudhomme
i
should
not
like
to
compromise
we
had
remarked
the
want
of
solidity
in
the
so
we
talked
with
lowered
voices
as
we
sat
together
in
the
little
private
room
lingering
over
the
dainty
dishes
of
a
dinner
exquisite
in
more
senses
than
one
we
had
come
as
far
as
the
roast
however
and
still
we
had
no
neighbors
no
sound
came
from
the
next
room
save
the
crackling
of
the
fire
but
when
the
clock
struck
eight
we
heard
voices
and
noisy
footsteps
the
waiters
brought
candles
evidently
there
was
a
party
assembled
in
the
next
room
and
at
the
first
words
i
knew
at
once
with
whom
we
had
to
do
four
bold
cormorants
as
ever
sprang
from
the
foam
on
the
crests
of
the
waves
of
this
present
generation
four
pleasant
young
fellows
whose
existence
was
problematical
since
they
were
not
known
to
possess
either
stock
or
landed
estates
yet
they
lived
and
lived
well
these
ingenious
of
a
modern
industrialism
that
has
come
to
be
the
most
ruthless
of
all
warfares
leave
anxieties
to
their
creditors
and
keep
the
pleasures
for
themselves
they
are
careful
for
nothing
save
dress
still
with
the
courage
of
the
jean
bart
order
that
will
smoke
cigars
on
a
barrel
of
powder
perhaps
by
way
of
keeping
up
their
character
with
a
quizzing
humor
that
outdoes
the
minor
newspapers
sparing
no
one
not
even
themselves
wary
keen
after
business
grasping
yet
open
handed
envious
yet
profound
politicians
by
fits
and
starts
analyzing
everything
guessing
everything
not
one
of
these
in
question
as
yet
had
contrived
to
make
his
way
in
the
world
which
they
chose
for
their
scene
of
operations
only
one
of
the
four
indeed
had
succeeded
in
coming
as
far
as
the
foot
of
the
ladder
to
have
money
is
nothing
the
man
only
finds
out
all
that
he
lacks
after
six
months
of
flatteries
andoche
finot
the
man
in
question
stiff
taciturn
cold
and
possessed
the
sort
of
spirit
which
will
not
shrink
from
groveling
before
any
creature
that
may
be
of
use
to
him
and
the
cunning
to
be
insolent
when
he
needs
a
man
no
longer
like
one
of
the
grotesque
figures
in
the
ballet
in
he
was
a
marquis
behind
a
boor
in
front
and
this
of
commerce
had
a
following
emile
blondet
journalist
with
abundance
of
intellectual
power
reckless
brilliant
and
indolent
could
do
anything
that
he
chose
yet
he
submitted
to
be
exploited
with
his
eyes
open
treacherous
or
kind
upon
impulse
a
man
to
love
but
not
to
respect
as
a
unable
to
refuse
his
pen
to
any
one
that
asked
or
his
heart
to
the
first
that
would
borrow
it
emile
was
the
most
fascinating
of
those
of
whom
a
fantastic
modern
wit
declared
that
he
liked
them
better
in
satin
slippers
than
in
the
third
in
the
party
couture
by
name
lived
by
speculation
grafting
one
affair
upon
another
to
make
the
gains
pay
for
the
losses
he
was
always
between
wind
and
water
keeping
himself
afloat
by
his
bold
sudden
strokes
and
the
nervous
energy
of
his
play
hither
and
thither
he
would
swim
over
the
vast
sea
of
interests
in
paris
in
quest
of
some
little
isle
that
should
be
so
far
a
debatable
land
that
he
might
abide
upon
it
clearly
couture
was
not
in
his
proper
place
as
for
the
fourth
and
most
malicious
personage
his
name
will
be
enough
it
was
bixiou
not
alas
the
bixiou
of
but
the
bixiou
of
a
misanthropic
buffoon
acknowledged
supreme
by
reason
of
his
energetic
and
caustic
wit
a
very
fiend
let
loose
now
that
he
saw
how
he
had
squandered
his
intellect
in
pure
waste
a
bixiou
vexed
by
the
thought
that
he
had
not
come
by
his
share
of
the
wreckage
in
the
last
revolution
a
bixiou
with
a
kick
for
every
one
like
pierrot
at
the
funambules
bixiou
had
the
whole
history
of
his
own
times
at
his
more
particularly
its
scandalous
chronicle
embellished
by
added
waggeries
of
his
own
he
sprang
like
a
clown
upon
everybody
s
back
only
to
do
his
utmost
to
leave
the
executioner
s
brand
upon
every
pair
of
shoulders
the
first
cravings
of
gluttony
satisfied
our
neighbors
reached
the
stage
at
which
we
also
had
arrived
to
wit
the
dessert
and
as
we
made
no
sign
they
believed
that
they
were
alone
thanks
to
the
champagne
the
talk
grew
confidential
as
they
dallied
with
the
dessert
amid
the
cigar
smoke
yet
through
it
all
you
felt
the
influence
of
the
icy
that
leaves
the
most
spontaneous
feeling
and
stiff
that
checks
the
most
generous
inspirations
and
gives
a
sharp
ring
to
the
laughter
their
was
full
of
bitter
irony
which
turns
a
jest
into
a
sneer
it
told
of
the
exhaustion
of
souls
given
over
to
themselves
of
lives
with
no
end
in
view
but
the
satisfaction
of
self
of
egoism
induced
by
these
times
of
peace
in
which
we
live
i
can
think
of
nothing
like
it
save
a
pamphlet
against
mankind
at
large
which
diderot
was
afraid
to
publish
a
book
that
bares
man
s
breast
simply
to
expose
the
upon
it
we
listened
to
just
such
a
pamphlet
as
s
spoken
aloud
in
all
good
faith
in
the
course
of
talk
in
which
nothing
not
even
the
point
which
the
speaker
wished
to
carry
was
sacred
from
epigram
nothing
taken
for
granted
nothing
built
up
except
on
ruins
nothing
reverenced
save
the
sceptic
s
adopted
article
of
belief
the
omnipotence
omniscience
and
universal
applicability
of
money
after
some
target
practice
at
the
outer
circle
of
their
acquaintances
they
turned
their
shafts
at
their
intimate
friends
with
a
sign
i
explained
my
wish
to
stay
and
listen
as
soon
as
bixiou
took
up
his
parable
as
will
shortly
be
seen
and
so
we
listened
to
one
of
those
terrific
improvisations
which
won
that
artist
such
a
name
among
a
certain
set
of
seared
and
jaded
spirits
and
often
interrupted
and
resumed
though
it
was
memory
serves
me
as
a
reporter
of
it
the
opinions
expressed
and
the
form
of
expression
lie
alike
outside
the
conditions
of
literature
it
was
more
properly
speaking
a
medley
of
sinister
revelations
that
paint
our
age
to
which
indeed
no
other
kind
of
story
should
be
told
and
besides
i
throw
all
the
responsibility
upon
the
principal
speaker
the
pantomime
and
the
gestures
that
accompanied
bixiou
s
changes
of
voice
as
he
acted
the
parts
of
the
various
persons
must
have
been
perfect
judging
by
the
applause
and
admiring
comments
that
broke
from
his
audience
of
three
then
did
rastignac
refuse
asked
blondet
apparently
addressing
finot
but
did
you
threaten
him
with
the
newspapers
asked
bixiou
he
began
to
laugh
returned
finot
rastignac
is
the
late
lamented
de
marsay
s
direct
heir
he
will
make
his
way
politically
as
well
as
socially
commented
blondet
but
how
did
he
make
his
money
asked
couture
in
both
he
and
the
illustrious
bianchon
lived
in
a
shabby
in
the
latin
quarter
his
people
ate
roast
cockchafers
and
their
own
wine
so
as
to
send
him
a
hundred
francs
every
month
his
father
s
property
was
not
worth
a
thousand
crowns
he
had
two
sisters
and
a
brother
on
his
hands
and
now
now
he
has
an
income
of
forty
thousand
livres
continued
finot
his
sisters
had
a
handsome
fortune
apiece
and
married
into
noble
families
he
leaves
his
mother
a
life
interest
in
the
property
even
in
i
have
known
him
without
a
penny
said
blondet
oh
in
said
bixiou
well
resumed
finot
yet
as
we
see
he
is
in
a
fair
way
to
be
a
minister
a
peer
of
france
anything
that
he
likes
he
broke
decently
with
delphine
three
years
ago
he
will
not
marry
except
on
good
grounds
and
he
may
marry
a
girl
of
noble
family
the
chap
had
the
sense
to
take
up
with
a
wealthy
my
friends
give
him
the
benefit
of
extenuating
circumstances
urged
blondet
when
he
escaped
the
clutches
of
want
he
dropped
into
the
claws
of
a
very
clever
you
know
what
nucingen
is
said
bixiou
in
the
early
days
delphine
and
rastignac
thought
him
he
seemed
to
regard
a
wife
as
a
plaything
an
ornament
in
his
house
and
that
very
fact
showed
me
that
the
man
was
square
at
the
base
as
well
as
in
height
added
bixiou
nucingen
makes
no
bones
about
admitting
that
his
wife
is
his
fortune
she
is
an
indispensable
chattel
but
a
wife
takes
a
second
place
in
the
life
of
a
political
leader
and
great
capitalist
he
once
said
in
my
hearing
that
bonaparte
had
blundered
like
a
bourgeois
in
his
early
relations
with
josephine
and
that
after
he
had
had
the
spirit
to
use
her
as
a
he
had
made
himself
ridiculous
by
trying
to
make
a
companion
of
any
man
of
unusual
powers
is
bound
to
take
oriental
views
of
women
said
blondet
the
baron
blended
the
opinions
of
east
and
west
in
a
charming
parisian
creed
he
abhorred
de
marsay
de
marsay
was
unmanageable
but
with
rastignac
he
was
much
pleased
he
exploited
him
though
rastignac
was
not
aware
of
it
all
the
burdens
of
married
life
were
put
on
him
rastignac
bore
the
brunt
of
delphine
s
whims
he
escorted
her
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
he
went
with
her
to
the
play
and
the
little
politician
and
great
man
of
spent
a
good
deal
of
his
life
at
that
time
in
writing
dainty
notes
eugene
was
scolded
for
little
nothings
from
the
first
he
was
in
good
spirits
when
delphine
was
cheerful
and
drooped
when
she
felt
low
he
bore
the
weight
of
her
confidences
and
her
ailments
he
gave
up
his
time
the
hours
of
his
precious
youth
to
fill
the
empty
void
of
that
fair
parisian
s
idleness
delphine
and
he
held
high
councils
on
the
toilettes
which
went
best
together
he
stood
the
fire
of
bad
temper
and
broadsides
of
pouting
fits
while
she
by
way
of
trimming
the
balance
was
very
nice
to
the
baron
as
for
the
baron
he
laughed
in
his
sleeve
but
whenever
he
saw
that
rastignac
was
bending
under
the
strain
of
the
burden
he
made
as
if
he
suspected
something
and
reunited
the
lovers
by
a
common
i
can
imagine
that
a
wealthy
wife
would
have
put
rastignac
in
the
way
of
a
living
and
an
honorable
living
but
where
did
he
pick
up
his
fortune
asked
couture
a
fortune
so
considerable
as
his
at
the
present
day
must
come
from
somewhere
and
nobody
ever
accused
him
of
inventing
a
good
stroke
of
somebody
left
it
to
him
said
finot
who
asked
blondet
some
fool
that
he
came
across
suggested
couture
he
did
not
steal
the
whole
of
it
my
little
dears
said
bixiou
let
not
your
terrors
rise
to
our
age
is
lenient
with
those
who
cheat
now
i
will
tell
you
about
the
beginnings
of
his
fortune
in
the
first
place
honor
to
talent
our
friend
is
not
a
chap
as
finot
describes
him
but
a
gentleman
in
the
english
sense
who
knows
the
cards
and
knows
the
game
whom
moreover
the
gallery
respects
rastignac
has
quite
as
much
intelligence
as
is
needed
at
a
given
moment
as
if
a
soldier
should
make
his
courage
payable
at
ninety
days
sight
with
three
witnesses
and
guarantees
he
may
seem
captious
inconsequent
vacillating
and
without
any
fixed
opinions
but
let
something
serious
turn
up
some
combination
to
scheme
out
he
will
not
scatter
himself
like
blondet
here
who
chooses
these
occasions
to
look
at
things
from
his
neighbor
s
point
of
view
rastignac
concentrates
himself
pulls
himself
together
looks
for
the
point
to
carry
by
storm
and
goes
full
tilt
for
it
he
charges
like
a
murat
breaks
squares
pounds
away
at
shareholders
promoters
and
the
whole
shop
and
returns
when
the
breach
is
made
to
his
lazy
careless
life
once
more
he
becomes
the
man
of
the
south
the
man
of
pleasure
the
trifling
idle
rastignac
he
has
earned
the
right
of
lying
in
bed
till
noon
because
a
crisis
never
finds
him
so
far
so
good
but
just
get
to
his
fortune
said
finot
bixiou
will
lash
that
off
at
a
stroke
replied
blondet
rastignac
s
fortune
was
delphine
de
nucingen
a
remarkable
woman
she
combines
boldness
with
did
she
ever
lend
you
money
inquired
bixiou
everybody
burst
out
laughing
you
are
mistaken
in
her
said
couture
speaking
to
blondet
her
cleverness
simply
consists
in
making
more
or
less
piquant
remarks
in
loving
rastignac
with
tedious
fidelity
and
obeying
him
blindly
she
is
a
regular
money
apart
andoche
finot
put
in
sourly
oh
come
come
said
bixiou
coaxingly
after
what
we
have
just
been
saying
will
you
venture
to
blame
poor
rastignac
for
living
at
the
expense
of
the
firm
of
nucingen
for
being
installed
in
furnished
rooms
precisely
as
la
torpille
was
once
installed
by
our
friend
des
lupeaulx
you
would
sink
to
the
vulgarity
of
the
rue
first
of
all
in
the
abstract
as
says
the
question
may
abide
the
of
pure
as
for
the
impure
reason
there
he
goes
said
finot
turning
to
blondet
but
there
is
reason
in
what
he
says
exclaimed
blondet
the
problem
is
a
very
old
one
it
was
the
grand
secret
of
the
famous
duel
between
la
chataigneraie
and
jarnac
it
was
cast
up
to
jarnac
that
he
was
on
good
terms
with
his
who
loving
him
only
too
well
equipped
him
sumptuously
when
a
thing
is
so
true
it
ought
not
to
be
said
out
of
devotion
to
henry
who
permitted
himself
this
slander
la
chataigneraie
took
it
upon
himself
and
there
followed
the
duel
which
enriched
the
french
language
with
the
expression
de
oh
does
it
go
so
far
back
then
it
is
noble
said
finot
as
a
proprietor
of
newspapers
and
reviews
of
old
standing
you
are
not
bound
to
know
that
said
blondet
there
are
women
bixiou
gravely
resumed
and
for
that
matter
men
too
who
can
cut
their
lives
in
two
and
give
away
but
remark
how
i
word
my
phrase
for
you
in
humanitarian
language
for
these
all
material
interests
lie
without
the
range
of
sentiment
they
give
their
time
their
life
their
honor
to
a
woman
and
hold
that
between
themselves
it
is
not
the
thing
to
meddle
with
bits
of
tissue
paper
bearing
the
legend
is
punishable
with
and
equally
they
will
take
nothing
from
a
woman
yes
the
whole
thing
is
debased
if
fusion
of
interests
follows
on
fusion
of
souls
this
is
a
doctrine
much
preached
and
very
seldom
oh
what
rubbish
cried
blondet
the
marechal
de
richelieu
understood
something
of
gallantry
and
he
settled
an
allowance
of
a
thousand
louis
d
or
on
mme
de
la
popeliniere
after
that
affair
of
the
behind
the

agnes
sorel
in
all
simplicity
took
her
fortune
to
charles
and
the
king
accepted
it
jacques
coeur
kept
the
crown
for
france
he
was
allowed
to
do
it
and
france
was
gentlemen
said
bixiou
a
love
that
does
not
imply
an
indissoluble
friendship
to
my
thinking
is
momentary
libertinage
what
sort
of
entire
surrender
is
it
that
keeps
something
back
between
these
two
diametrically
opposed
doctrines
the
one
as
profoundly
immoral
as
the
other
there
is
no
possible
compromise
it
seems
to
me
that
any
shrinking
from
a
complete
union
is
surely
due
to
a
belief
that
the
union
can
not
last
and
if
so
farewell
to
illusion
the
passion
that
does
not
believe
that
it
will
last
for
ever
is
a
hideous
thing
here
is
pure
unadulterated
fenelon
for
you
at
the
same
time
those
who
know
the
world
the
observer
the
man
of
the
world
the
wearers
of
irreproachable
gloves
and
ties
the
men
who
do
not
blush
to
marry
a
woman
for
her
money
proclaim
the
necessity
of
a
complete
separation
of
sentiment
and
interest
the
other
sort
are
lunatics
that
love
and
imagine
that
they
and
the
woman
they
love
are
the
only
two
beings
in
the
world
for
them
millions
are
dirt
the
glove
or
the
camellia
flower
that
she
wore
is
worth
millions
if
the
squandered
filthy
lucre
is
never
to
be
found
again
in
their
possession
you
find
the
remains
of
floral
relics
hoarded
in
dainty
boxes
they
can
not
distinguish
themselves
one
from
the
other
for
them
there
is
no
i
left
that
is
their
word
made
flesh
what
can
you
do
can
you
stop
the
course
of
this
hidden
disease
of
the
heart
there
are
fools
that
love
without
calculation
and
wise
men
that
calculate
while
they
to
my
thinking
bixiou
is
sublime
cried
blondet
what
does
finot
say
to
it
anywhere
else
said
finot
drawing
himself
up
in
his
cravat
anywhere
else
i
should
say
with
the
gentlemen
but
here
i
think
with
the
scoundrelly
scapegraces
with
whom
you
have
the
honor
to
associate
said
bixiou
upon
my
word
and
you
asked
bixiou
turning
to
couture
stuff
and
nonsense
cried
couture
the
woman
that
will
not
make
a
of
her
body
that
the
man
she
singles
out
may
reach
his
goal
is
a
woman
that
has
no
heart
except
for
her
own
and
you
blondet
i
do
not
preach
i
very
good
rejoined
bixiou
in
his
most
ironical
tones
rastignac
was
not
of
your
way
of
thinking
to
take
without
repaying
is
detestable
and
even
rather
bad
form
but
to
take
that
you
may
render
a
like
the
lord
is
a
chivalrous
deed
this
was
rastignac
s
view
he
felt
profoundly
humiliated
by
his
community
of
interests
with
delphine
de
nucingen
i
can
tell
you
that
he
regretted
it
i
have
seen
him
deploring
his
position
with
tears
in
his
eyes
yes
he
shed
tears
he
did
indeed
after
supper
well
now
to
way
of
thinking
i
say
you
are
laughing
at
us
said
finot
not
the
least
in
the
world
we
were
talking
of
rastignac
from
your
point
of
view
his
affliction
would
be
a
sign
of
his
corruption
for
by
that
time
he
was
not
nearly
so
much
in
love
with
delphine
what
would
you
have
he
felt
the
prick
in
his
heart
poor
fellow
but
he
was
a
man
of
noble
descent
and
profound
depravity
whereas
we
are
virtuous
artists
so
rastignac
meant
to
enrich
delphine
he
was
a
poor
man
she
a
rich
woman
would
you
believe
it
he
succeeded
rastignac
who
might
have
fought
at
need
like
jarnac
went
over
to
the
opinion
of
henri
ii
on
the
strength
of
his
great
maxim
there
is
no
such
thing
as
absolute
right
there
are
only
this
brings
us
to
the
history
of
his
you
might
just
as
well
make
a
start
with
your
story
instead
of
drawing
us
on
to
traduce
ourselves
said
blondet
with
urbane
good
humor
aha
my
boy
returned
bixiou
administering
a
little
tap
to
the
back
of
blondet
s
head
you
are
making
up
for
lost
time
over
the
champagne
oh
by
the
sacred
name
of
shareholder
get
on
with
your
story
cried
couture
i
was
within
an
ace
of
it
retorted
bixiou
but
you
with
your
profanity
have
brought
me
to
the
then
are
there
shareholders
in
the
tale
inquired
finot
yes
rich
as
rich
can
be
like
it
seems
to
me
finot
began
stiffly
that
some
consideration
is
owing
to
a
good
fellow
to
whom
you
look
for
a
bill
for
five
hundred
francs
upon
occasion
waiter
called
bixiou
what
do
you
want
with
the
waiter
asked
blondet
i
want
five
hundred
francs
to
repay
finot
so
that
i
can
tear
up
my
and
set
my
tongue
get
on
with
your
story
said
finot
making
believe
to
laugh
i
take
you
all
to
witness
that
i
am
not
the
property
of
this
insolent
fellow
who
fancies
that
my
silence
is
worth
no
more
than
five
hundred
francs
you
will
never
be
a
minister
if
you
can
not
gauge
people
s
consciences
there
my
good
finot
he
added
soothingly
i
will
get
on
with
my
story
without
personalities
and
we
shall
be
now
said
couture
with
a
smile
he
will
begin
to
prove
for
our
benefit
that
nucingen
made
rastignac
s
you
are
not
so
far
out
as
you
think
returned
bixiou
you
do
not
know
what
nucingen
is
financially
do
you
know
so
much
as
a
word
as
to
his
beginnings
asked
blondet
i
have
only
known
him
in
his
own
house
said
bixiou
but
we
may
have
seen
each
other
in
the
street
in
the
old
the
prosperity
of
the
firm
of
nucingen
is
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
things
seen
in
our
days
began
blondet
in
nucingen
s
name
was
scarcely
known
at
that
time
bankers
would
have
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
three
hundred
thousand
francs
worth
of
his
acceptances
in
the
market
the
great
capitalist
felt
his
inferiority
how
was
he
to
get
known
he
suspended
payment
good
every
market
rang
with
a
name
hitherto
only
known
in
strasbourg
and
the
quartier
poissonniere
he
issued
deposit
certificates
to
his
creditors
and
resumed
payment
forthwith
people
grew
accustomed
to
his
paper
all
over
france
then
an
happened
his
paper
revived
was
in
demand
and
rose
in
value
nucingen
s
paper
was
much
inquired
for
the
year
arrives
my
banker
calls
in
his
capital
buys
up
government
stock
before
the
battle
of
waterloo
suspends
payment
again
in
the
thick
of
the
crisis
and
meets
his
engagements
with
shares
in
the
wortschin
mines
which
he
himself
issued
at
twenty
per
cent
more
than
he
gave
for
them
yes
gentlemen
he
took
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
bottles
of
champagne
of
grandet
to
cover
himself
forseeing
the
failure
of
the
virtuous
parent
of
the
present
comte
d
aubrion
and
as
much
bordeaux
wine
of
duberghe
at
the
same
time
those
three
hundred
thousand
bottles
which
he
took
over
and
took
at
thirty
sous
apiece
my
dear
boy
he
supplied
at
the
price
of
six
francs
per
bottle
to
the
allies
in
the
palais
royal
during
the
foreign
occupation
between
and
nucingen
s
name
and
his
paper
acquired
a
european
celebrity
the
illustrious
baron
so
far
from
being
engulfed
like
others
rose
the
higher
for
calamities
twice
his
arrangements
had
paid
holders
of
his
paper
uncommonly
well
try
to
swindle
them
impossible
he
is
supposed
to
be
as
honest
a
man
as
you
will
find
when
he
suspends
payment
a
third
time
his
paper
will
circulate
in
asia
mexico
and
australia
among
the
aborigines
no
one
but
ouvrard
saw
through
this
alsacien
banker
the
son
of
some
jew
or
other
converted
by
ambition
ouvrard
said
when
nucingen
lets
gold
go
you
may
be
sure
that
it
is
to
catch
his
crony
du
tillet
is
just
such
another
said
finot
and
mind
you
that
of
birth
du
tillet
has
just
precisely
as
much
as
is
necessary
to
exist
the
chap
had
not
a
farthing
in
and
you
see
what
he
is
now
and
he
has
done
something
that
none
of
us
has
managed
to
do
i
am
not
speaking
of
you
couture
he
has
had
friends
instead
of
enemies
in
fact
he
has
kept
his
past
life
so
quiet
that
unless
you
rake
the
sewers
you
are
not
likely
to
find
out
that
he
was
an
assistant
in
a
perfumer
s
shop
in
the
rue
saint
honore
no
further
back
than
tut
tut
tut
said
bixiou
do
not
think
of
comparing
nucingen
with
a
little
dabbler
like
du
tillet
a
jackal
that
gets
on
in
life
through
his
sense
of
smell
he
scents
a
carcass
by
instinct
and
comes
in
time
to
get
the
best
bone
besides
just
look
at
the
two
men
the
one
has
a
face
like
a
cat
he
is
thin
and
lanky
the
other
is
cubical
fat
heavy
as
a
sack
imperturbable
as
a
diplomatist
nucingen
has
a
thick
heavy
hand
and
lynx
eyes
that
never
light
up
his
depths
are
not
in
front
but
behind
he
is
inscrutable
you
never
see
what
he
is
making
for
whereas
du
tillet
s
cunning
as
napoleon
said
to
somebody
i
have
forgotten
the
name
is
like
cotton
spun
too
fine
it
i
do
not
myself
see
that
nucingen
has
any
advantage
over
du
tillet
said
blondet
unless
it
is
that
he
has
the
sense
to
see
that
a
capitalist
ought
not
to
rise
higher
than
a
baron
s
rank
while
du
tillet
has
a
mind
to
be
an
italian
blondet
one
word
my
boy
put
in
couture
in
the
first
place
nucingen
dared
to
say
that
honesty
is
simply
a
question
of
appearances
and
secondly
to
know
him
well
you
must
be
in
business
yourself
with
him
banking
is
but
a
single
department
and
a
very
small
one
he
holds
government
contracts
for
wines
wools
indigoes
anything
in
short
on
which
any
profit
can
be
made
he
has
an
genius
the
elephant
of
finance
would
contract
to
deliver
votes
on
a
division
or
the
greeks
to
the
turks
for
him
business
means
the
of
varieties
as
cousin
would
say
the
unity
of
specialties
looked
at
in
this
way
banking
becomes
a
kind
of
statecraft
in
itself
requiring
a
powerful
head
and
a
man
thoroughly
tempered
is
drawn
on
to
set
himself
above
the
laws
of
a
morality
that
cramps
right
my
son
said
blondet
but
we
and
we
alone
can
comprehend
that
this
means
bringing
war
into
the
financial
world
a
banker
is
a
conquering
general
making
sacrifices
on
a
tremendous
scale
to
gain
ends
that
no
one
perceives
his
soldiers
are
private
people
s
interests
he
has
stratagems
to
plan
out
partisans
to
bring
into
the
field
ambushes
to
set
towns
to
take
most
men
of
this
stamp
are
so
close
upon
the
borders
of
politics
that
in
the
end
they
are
drawn
into
public
life
and
thereby
lose
their
fortunes
the
firm
of
necker
for
instance
was
ruined
in
this
way
the
famous
samuel
bernard
was
all
but
ruined
some
great
capitalist
in
every
age
makes
a
colossal
fortune
and
leaves
behind
him
neither
fortune
nor
a
family
there
was
the
firm
of
paris
brothers
for
instance
that
helped
to
pull
down
law
there
was
law
himself
beside
whom
other
promoters
of
companies
are
but
pigmies
there
was
bouret
and
beaujon
none
of
them
left
any
representative
finance
like
time
devours
its
own
children
if
the
banker
is
to
perpetuate
himself
he
must
found
a
noble
house
a
dynasty
like
the
fuggers
of
antwerp
that
lent
money
to
charles
and
were
created
princes
of
babenhausen
a
family
that
exists
at
this
day
in
the
de
the
instinct
of
working
it
may
be
unconsciously
leads
the
banker
to
seek
a
title
jacques
coeur
was
the
founder
of
the
great
noble
house
of
noirmoutier
extinct
in
the
reign
of
louis
xiii
what
power
that
man
had
he
was
ruined
for
making
a
legitimate
king
and
he
died
prince
of
an
island
in
the
archipelago
where
he
built
a
magnificent
oh
you
are
giving
us
an
historical
lecture
we
are
wandering
away
from
the
present
the
crown
has
no
right
of
conferring
nobility
and
barons
and
counts
are
made
with
closed
doors
more
is
the
pity
said
finot
you
regret
the
times
of
the
a
when
you
could
buy
an
office
that
ennobled
asked
bixiou
you
are
right
reviens
a
nos
do
you
know
beaudenord
no
no
no
ah
well
see
how
all
things
pass
away
poor
fellow
ten
years
ago
he
was
the
flower
of
dandyism
and
now
so
thoroughly
absorbed
that
you
no
more
know
him
than
finot
just
now
knew
the
origin
of
the
expression
de
i
repeat
that
simply
for
the
sake
of
illustration
and
not
to
tease
you
finot
well
it
is
a
fact
he
belonged
to
the
faubourg
beaudenord
is
the
first
pigeon
that
i
will
bring
on
the
scene
and
in
the
first
place
his
name
was
godefroid
de
beaudenord
neither
finot
nor
blondet
nor
couture
nor
i
am
likely
to
undervalue
such
an
advantage
as
that
after
a
ball
when
a
score
of
pretty
women
stand
behooded
waiting
for
their
carriages
with
their
husbands
and
adorers
at
their
sides
beaudenord
could
hear
his
people
called
without
a
pang
of
mortification
in
the
second
place
he
rejoiced
in
the
full
complement
of
limbs
he
was
whole
and
sound
had
no
mote
in
his
eyes
no
false
hair
no
artificial
calves
he
was
neither
nor
his
dorsal
column
was
straight
his
waist
slender
his
hands
white
and
shapely
his
hair
was
black
he
was
of
a
complexion
neither
too
pink
like
a
grocer
s
assistant
nor
yet
too
brown
like
a
calabrese
finally
and
this
is
an
essential
point
beaudenord
was
not
too
handsome
like
some
of
our
friends
that
look
rather
too
much
of
professional
beauties
to
be
anything
else
but
no
more
of
that
we
have
said
it
it
is
shocking
well
he
was
a
crack
shot
and
sat
a
horse
to
admiration
he
had
fought
a
duel
for
a
trifle
and
had
not
killed
his
man
if
you
wish
to
know
in
what
pure
complete
and
unadulterated
happiness
consists
in
this
nineteenth
century
in
paris
the
happiness
that
is
to
say
of
a
young
man
of
do
you
realize
that
you
must
enter
into
the
infinitely
small
details
of
existence
beaudenord
s
bootmaker
had
precisely
hit
off
his
style
of
foot
he
was
well
shod
his
tailor
loved
to
clothe
him
godefroid
neither
rolled
his
r
s
nor
lapsed
into
normanisms
nor
gascon
he
spoke
pure
and
correct
french
and
tied
his
cravat
correctly
like
finot
he
had
neither
father
nor
mother
such
luck
had
he
and
his
guardian
was
the
marquis
d
aiglemont
his
cousin
by
marriage
he
could
go
among
city
people
as
he
chose
and
the
faubourg
could
make
no
objection
for
fortunately
a
young
bachelor
is
allowed
to
make
his
own
pleasure
his
sole
rule
of
life
he
is
at
liberty
to
betake
himself
wherever
amusement
is
to
be
found
and
to
shun
the
gloomy
places
where
cares
flourish
and
multiply
finally
he
had
been
vaccinated
you
know
what
i
mean
blondet
and
yet
in
spite
of
all
these
virtues
continued
bixiou
he
might
very
well
have
been
a
very
unhappy
young
man
eh
eh
that
word
happiness
unhappily
seems
to
us
to
mean
something
absolute
a
delusion
which
sets
so
many
wiseacres
inquiring
what
happiness
is
a
very
clever
woman
said
that
happiness
was
where
you
chose
to
put
she
formulated
a
dismal
truth
said
blondet
and
a
moral
added
finot
double
distilled
said
blondet
happiness
like
good
like
evil
is
relative
wherefore
la
fontaine
used
to
hope
that
in
the
course
of
time
the
damned
would
feel
as

modern

passed

its
fairest
title
to
glory
from
a
hypothetical
to
a
positive
science
through
the
influence
of
the
great
analytical
school
of
paris
has
proved
beyond
a
doubt
that
a
man
is
periodically
renewed
throughout
new
haft
new
blade
like
jeannot
s
knife
and
yet
you
think
that
he
is
still
the

there
are
several

we
call

there
was
neither

nor

in

of
who
would

in

who
would
be

that
is
to

not
for

youth
nor
for

nor
for

but
spontaneously
and
not
even
merely
in

for
his
own
love
a
young
man
i
say
who
has
found
love
in
the
abstract
to
quote
might
yet
very
possibly
find
never
a
farthing
in
the
purse
which
she

him
he
might
owe

to
his

he
might

the

his
very
tailor
like
france
herself
might
at

show
signs
of
disaffection
in

he
might
have
love
and
yet
be
poor
and
poverty
spoils
a

he
holds
our
transcendental
views
of
the
fusion

i
know
nothing
more

than
happiness

with

without

for

for

asked
bixiou
addressing
finot
well
go
to
the
tuileries
and
look
at
a
figure
there
something
like
a
fireman
carved
in
marble

the
statuary
calls
it
try
to
walk
like
the
commandant

statue
and
you
will
never
be
it
was
through
strict
observance
of
the
great
law
of
the
that
godefroid
s
happiness
became
complete
there
is
the
story
beaudenord
had
a
tiger
not
a
groom
as
they
write
that
know
nothing
of
society
the
tiger
a
diminutive
irish
page
called
paddy
toby
joby
which
you
please
was
three
feet
in
height
by
twenty
inches
in
breadth
a
infant
with
nerves
of
steel
tempered
in
and
agile
as
a
squirrel
he
drove
a
landau
with
a
skill
never
yet
at
fault
in
london
or
paris
he
had
a
lizard
s
eye
as
sharp
as
my
own
and
he
could
mount
a
horse
like
the
elder
franconi
with
the
rosy
cheeks
and
yellow
hair
of
one
of
rubens
madonnas
he
was
as
a
prince
and
as
knowing
as
an
old
attorney
in
short
at
the
age
of
ten
he
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
blossom
of
depravity
gambling
and
swearing
partial
to
jam
and
punch
pert
as
a
impudent
and
as
any
paris
he
had
been
a
source
of
honor
and
profit
to
a
english
lord
for
whom
he
had
already
won
seven
hundred
thousand
francs
on
the
the
aforesaid
nobleman
set
no
small
store
on
toby
his
tiger
was
a
curiosity
the
very
smallest
tiger
in
town
perched
aloft
on
the
back
of
a
thoroughbred
joby
looked
like
a
hawk
yet
the
great
man
dismissed
him
not
for
greediness
not
for
dishonesty
nor
murder
nor
rudeness
to
my
lady
nor
for
cutting
holes
in
my
lady
s
own
woman
s
pockets
nor
because
he
had
been
got
at
by
some
of
his
master
s
rivals
on
the
turf
nor
for
playing
games
of
a
sunday
nor
for
bad
behavior
of
any
sort
or
description
toby
might
have
done
all
these
things
he
might
even
have
spoken
to
milord
before
milord
spoke
to
him
and
his
noble
master
might
perhaps
have
pardoned
that
breach
of
the
law
domestic
milord
would
have
put
up
with
a
good
deal
from
toby
he
was
very
fond
of
him
toby
could
drive
a
tandem
riding
on
the
wheeler
postilion
fashion
his
legs
did
not
reach
the
shafts
he
looked
in
fact
very
much
like
one
of
the
cherub
heads
circling
about
the
eternal
father
in
old
italian
pictures
but
an
english
journalist
wrote
a
delicious
description
of
the
little
angel
in
the
course
of
which
he
said
that
paddy
was
quite
too
pretty
for
a
tiger
in
fact
he
offered
to
bet
that
paddy
was
a
tame
tigress
the
description
on
the
heads
of
it
was
calculated
to
poison
minds
and
end
in
something
and
the
superlative
of
improper
is
the
way
to
the
gallows
milord
s
circumspection
was
highly
approved
by
my
lady
but
poor
toby
now
that
his
precise
position
in
insular
zoology
had
been
called
in
question
found
himself
hopelessly
out
of
place
at
that
time
godefroid
had
blossomed
out
at
the
french
embassy
in
london
where
he
learned
the
adventures
of
toby
joby
paddy
godefroid
found
the
infant
weeping
over
a
pot
of
jam
he
had
already
lost
the
guineas
with
which
milord
gilded
his
misfortune
godefroid
took
possession
of
him
and
so
it
fell
out
that
on
his
return
among
us
he
brought
back
with
him
the
sweetest
thing
in
tigers
from
england
he
was
known
by
his
tiger
as
couture
is
known
by
his
waistcoats
and
found
no
difficulty
in
entering
the
fraternity
of
the
club
yclept
the
grammont
he
had
renounced
the
diplomatic
career
he
ceased
accordingly
to
alarm
the
susceptibilites
of
the
ambitious
and
as
he
had
no
very
dangerous
amount
of
intellect
he
was
well
looked
upon
everywhere
some
of
us
would
feel
mortified
if
we
saw
only
smiling
faces
wherever
we
went
we
enjoy
the
sour
contortions
of
envy
godefroid

not
like
to
be
disliked

one

his
taste
now

the
solid
practical

with

you
to
whom
paris
is
known
down
to
its
very
excrescences
will
see
that
beaudenord
must
have
acquired
about
seventeen
thousand
livres
per

for
he
paid
some
seventeen
francs
of
taxes
and
spent
a
thousand
crowns
on
his
own
whims
well
dear
boys
when
godefroid
came
of
age
the
marquis
d
aiglemont
submitted
to
him
such
an
account
of
his
trust
as
none
of
us
would
be
likely
to
give

of
eighteen

remnant
of
his

the
harrow
of
the
great
reduction
under
the
republic
and
the
hailstorms
of
imperial
arrears
d
aiglemont
that
upright
guardian
also
put
his
ward
in
possession
of
some
thirty
thousand
francs
of
savings
invested
with
the
firm
of
nucingen
saying
with
all
the
charm
of
a
and
the
indulgence
of
a
soldier
of
the
empire
that
he
had
contrived
to
put
it
aside
for
his

young
man

follies
if
you
will
take
my
advice

added
he
instead
of
squandering
the
money
like
a
fool
as
so
many
young
men
do
let
it
go
in
follies
that
will
be
useful
to
you
afterwards
take
an
attache
s
post
at
turin
and
then
go
to
naples
and
from
naples
to
london
and
you
will
be
amused
and
learn
something
for
your
money
afterwards
if
you
think
of
a
career

the

will
not

the
late
lamented
d

more
sense
than
people
credited
him
with
which
is
more
than
can

of

never

away

to
have

himself

himself
with
four

is
to

laid
in

up

came
to
pass
that
a
thousand

over

was
altogether
insufficient
to
keep
up

of
a

feeling
pinched
with

saw
the
necessity
of
creating
what

call
a
balance
in

it
was
a
great
notion

capital
and
with
that
you
will
be
quite
in
three
days
time
our
godefroid
was
comfortable
his
increase
of
income
exactly
supplied
his
superfluities
his
material
happiness
was
complete
suppose
that
it
were
possible
to
read
the
minds
of
all
the
young
men
in
paris
at
one
glance
as
it
appears
will
be
done
at
the
day
of
judgment
with
all
the
millions
upon
millions
that
have
groveled
in
all
spheres
and
worn
all
uniforms
or
the
uniform
of
nature
and
to
ask
them
whether
happiness
at
is
or
is
not
made
up
of
the
following
items
to
wit
to
own
a
and
a
tilbury
or
a
cab
with
a
fresh
toby
joby
paddy
no
bigger
than
your
fist
and
to
hire
an
unimpeachable
brougham
for
twelve
francs
an
evening
to
appear
elegantly
arrayed
agreeably
to
the
laws
that
regulate
a
man
s
clothes
at
eight
o
clock
at
noon
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
and
in
the
evening
to
be
well
received
at
every
embassy
and
to
cull
the
flowers
of
superficial
cosmopolitan
friendships
to
be
not
insufferably
handsome
to
carry
your
head
your
coat
and
your
name
well
to
inhabit
a
charming
little
entresol
after
the
pattern
of
the
rooms
just
described
on
the
quai
malaquais
to
be
able
to
ask
a
party
of
friends
to
dine
at
the
de
without
a
previous
consultation
with
your
trousers
pocket
never
to
be
pulled
up
in
any
rational
project
by
the
words
and
the
money
and
finally
to
be
able
to
renew
at
pleasure
the
pink
rosettes
that
adorn
the
ears
of
three
thoroughbreds
and
the
lining
of
your
hat
to
such
inquiry
any
ordinary
young
man
and
we
ourselves
that
are
not
ordinary
men
would
reply
that
the
happiness
is
incomplete
that
it
is
like
the
madeleine
without
the
altar
that
a
man
must
love
and
be
loved
or
love
without
return
or
be
loved
without
loving
or
love
at
cross
purposes
now
for
happiness
as
a
mental
condition
in
january
after
godefroid
de
beaudenord
had
set
foot
in
the
various
social
circles
which
it
pleased
him
to
enter
and
knew
his
way
about
in
them
and
felt
himself
secure
amid
these
joys
he
saw
the
necessity
of
a
sunshade
the
advantage
of
having
a
great
lady
to
complain
of
instead
of
chewing
the
stems
of
roses
bought
for
fivepence
apiece
of
mme
prevost
after
the
manner
of
the
callow
youngsters
that
chirp
and
cackle
in
the
lobbies
of
the
opera
like
chickens
in
a
coop
in
short
he
resolved
to
centre
his
ideas
his
sentiments
his
affections
upon
a
woman
la
phamme
ah
at
first
he
conceived
the
preposterous
notion
of
an
unhappy
passion
and
gyrated
for
a
while
about
his
fair
cousin
mme
d
aiglemont
not
perceiving
that
she
had
already
danced
the
waltz
in
faust
with
a
diplomatist
the
year
went
by
spent
in
tentatives
in
futile
flirtations
and
an
unsuccessful
quest
the
loving
object
of
which
he
was
in
search
did
not
appear
passion
is
extremely
rare
and
in
our
time
as
many
barriers
have
been
raised
against
passion
in
social
life
as
barricades
in
the
streets
in
truth
my
brothers
the
improper
is
gaining
upon
us
i
tell
you
as
we
may
incur
reproach
for
following
on
the
heels
of
portrait
painters
auctioneers
and
fashionable
dressmakers
i
will
not
inflict
any
description
upon
you
of
in
whom
godefroid
recognized
the
female
of
his
species
age
nineteen
height
four
feet
eleven
inches
fair
hair
eyebrows
blue
eyes
forehead
neither
high
nor
low
curved
nose
little
mouth
short
chin
oval
face
distinguishing
signs
none
such
was
the
description
on
the
passport
of
the
beloved
object
you
will
not
ask
more
than
the
police
or
their
worships
the
mayors
of
all
the
towns
and
communes
of
france
the
gendarmes
and
the
rest
of
the
powers
that
be
in
other
respects
i
give
you
my
word
for
it
she
was
a
rough
sketch
of
a
venus
dei
medici
the
first
time
that
godefroid
went
to
one
of
the
balls
for
which
mme
de
nucingen
enjoyed
a
certain
not
undeserved
reputation
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
future
in
a
quadrille
and
was
set
marveling
by
that
height
of
four
feet
eleven
inches
the
fair
hair
rippled
in
a
shower
of
curls
about
the
little
girlish
head
she
looked
as
fresh
as
a
naiad
peeping
out
through
the
crystal
pane
of
her
stream
to
take
a
look
at
the
spring
flowers
this
is
quite
in
the
modern
style
strings
of
phrases
as
endless
as
the
macaroni
on
the
table
a
while
ago
on
that
eyebrows
no
offence
to
the
prefect
of
police
parny
that
writer
of
light
and
playful
verse
would
have
hung
couplets
comparing
them
very
agreeably
to
cupid
s
bow
at
the
same
time
bidding
us
to
observe
that
the
dart
was
beneath
the
said
dart
however
was
neither
very
potent
nor
very
penetrating
for
as
yet
it
was
controlled
by
the
sweetness
of
a
mlle
de
la
valliere
as
depicted
on
at
the
moment
when
she
solemnizes
her
betrothal
in
the
sight
of
heaven
any
solemnization
before
the
registrar
being
quite
out
to
the
question
you
know
the
effect
of
fair
hair
and
blue
eyes
in
the
soft
voluptuous
decorous
dance
such
a
girl
does
not
knock
audaciously
at
your
heart
like
the
damsels
that
seem
to
say
after
the
fashion
of
spanish
beggars
your
money
or
your
life
give
me
five
francs
or
take
my
contempt
these
insolent
and
somewhat
dangerous
beauties
may
find
favor
in
the
sight
of
many
men
but
to
my
thinking
the
blonde
that
has
the
good
fortune
to
look
extremely
tender
and
yielding
while
foregoing
none
of
her
rights
to
scold
to
tease
to
use
unmeasured
language
to
be
jealous
without
grounds
to
do
anything
in
short
that
makes
woman
adorable
the
girl
i
say
will
always
be
more
sure
to
marry
than
the
ardent
brunette
firewood
is
dear
you
see
isaure
white
as
an
alsacienne
she
first
saw
the
light
at
strasbourg
and
spoke
german
with
a
slight
and
very
agreeable
french
accent
danced
to
admiration
her
feet
omitted
on
the
passport
though
they
really
might
have
found
a
place
there
under
the
heading
distinguishing
signs
were
remarkable
for
their
small
size
and
for
that
particular
something
which
dancing
masters
used
to
call
a
something
that
put
you
in
mind
of
mlle
mars
agreeable
delivery
for
all
the
muses
are
sisters
and
the
dancer
and
poet
alike
have
their
feet
upon
the
earth
isaure
s
feet
spoke
lightly
and
swiftly
with
a
clearness
and
precision
which
augured
well
for
things
of
the
heart
a
duc
was
old
marcel
s
highest
word
of
praise
and
old
marcel
was
the
dancing
master
that
deserved
the
epithet
of
the
people
used
to
say
the
great
marcel
as
they
said
frederick
the
great
and
in
frederick
s
did
marcel
compose
any
ballets
inquired
finot
yes
something
in
the
style
of
quatre
and
europe
what
times
they
were
when
great
nobles
dressed
the
dancers
said
finot
improper
said
bixiou
isaure
did
not
raise
herself
on
the
tips
of
her
toes
she
stayed
on
the
ground
she
swayed
in
the
dance
without
jerks
and
neither
more
nor
less
voluptuously
than
a
young
lady
ought
to
do
there
was
a
profound
philosophy
in
marcel
s
remark
that
every
age
and
condition
had
its
dance
a
married
woman
should
not
dance
like
a
young
girl
nor
a
little
jackanapes
like
a
capitalist
nor
a
soldier
like
a
page
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
infantry
ought
not
to
dance
like
the
cavalry
and
from
this
point
he
proceeded
to
classify
the
world
at
large
all
these
fine
distinctions
seem
very
far
ah
said
blondet
you
have
set
your
finger
on
a
great
calamity
if
marcel
had
been
properly
understood
there
would
have
been
no
french
it
had
been
godefroid
s
privilege
to
run
over
europe
resumed
bixiou
nor
had
he
neglected
his
opportunities
of
making
a
thorough
comparative
study
of
european
dancing
perhaps
but
for
profound
diligence
in
the
pursuit
of
what
is
usually
held
to
be
useless
knowledge
he
would
never
have
fallen
in
love
with
this
young
lady
as
it
was
out
of
the
three
hundred
guests
that
crowded
the
handsome
rooms
in
the
rue
he
alone
comprehended
the
unpublished
romance
revealed
by
a
garrulous
quadrille
people
certainly
noticed
isaure
d
aldrigger
s
dancing
but
in
this
present
century
the
cry
is
skim
lightly
over
the
surface
do
not
lean
your
weight
on
it
so
one
said
he
was
a
notary
s
clerk
there
is
a
girl
that
dances
uncommonly
well
another
a
lady
in
a
turban
there
is
a
young
lady
that
dances
enchantingly
and
a
third
a
woman
of
thirty
that
little
thing
is
not
dancing
but
to
return
to
the
great
marcel
let
us
parody
his
best
known
saying
with
how
much
there
is
in
an
and
let
us
get
on
a
little
faster
said
blondet
you
are
isaure
continued
bixiou
looking
askance
at
blondet
wore
a
simple
white
crepe
dress
with
green
ribbons
she
had
a
camellia
in
her
hair
a
camellia
at
her
waist
another
camellia
at
her
and
a
camellia
come
now
here
comes
sancho
s
three
hundred
therein
lies
all
literature
dear
boy
is
a
masterpiece
there
are
fourteen
volumes
of
her
and
the
most
playwright
would
give
you
the
whole
of
in
a
single
act
so
long
as
i
amuse
you
what
have
you
to
complain
of
that
costume
was
positively
lovely
don
t
you
like
camillias
would
you
rather
have
dahlias
no
very
good
chestnuts
then
here
s
for
and
probably
bixiou
flung
a
chestnut
across
the
table
for
we
heard
something
drop
on
a
plate
i
was
wrong
i
acknowledge
it
go
on
said
blondet
i
resume
pretty
enough
to
marry
isn
t
she
said
rastignac
coming
up
to
godefroid
de
beaudenord
and
indicating
the
little
one
with
the
spotless
white
camellias
every
petal
intact
rastignac
being
an
intimate
friend
godefroid
answered
in
a
low
voice
well
so
i
was
thinking
i
was
saying
to
myself
that
instead
of
enjoying
my
happiness
with
fear
and
trembling
at
every
moment
instead
of
taking
a
world
of
trouble
to
whisper
a
word
in
an
inattentive
ear
of
looking
over
the
house
at
the
italiens
to
see
if
some
one
wears
a
red
flower
or
a
white
in
her
hair
or
watching
along
the
corso
for
a
gloved
hand
on
a
carriage
door
as
we
used
to
do
at
milan
instead
of
snatching
a
mouthful
of
baba
like
a
lackey
finishing
off
a
bottle
behind
a
door
or
wearing
out
one
s
wits
with
giving
and
receiving
letters
like
a
postman
letters
that
consist
not
of
a
mere
couple
of
tender
lines
but
expand
to
five
folio
volumes
and
contract
to
a
couple
of
sheets
a
tiresome
practice
instead
of
dragging
along
over
the
ruts
and
dodging
behind
hedges
it
would
be
better
to
give
way
to
the
adorable
passion
that
rousseau
envied
to
fall
frankly
in
love
with
a
girl
like
isaure
with
a
view
to
making
her
my
wife
if
upon
exchange
of
sentiments
our
hearts
respond
to
each
other
to
be
werther
in
short
with
a
happy
which
is
a
common
weakness
returned
rastignac
without
laughing
possibly
in
your
place
i
might
plunge
into
the
unspeakable
delights
of
that
ascetic
course
it
possesses
the
merits
of
novelty
and
originality
and
it
is
not
very
expensive
your
monna
lisa
is
sweet
but
inane
as
music
for
the
ballet
i
give
you
rastignac
made
this
last
remark
in
a
way
which
set
beaudenord
thinking
that
his
friend
had
his
own
motives
for
disenchanting
him
beaudenord
had
not
been
a
diplomatist
for
nothing
he
fancied
that
rastignac
wanted
to
cut
him
out
if
a
man
mistakes
his
vocation
the
false
start
none
the
less
influences
him
for
the
rest
of
his
life
godefroid
was
so
evidently
smitten
with
mlle
isaure
d
aldrigger
that
rastignac
went
off
to
a
tall
girl
chatting
in
the
malvina
he
said
lowering
his
voice
your
sister
has
just
netted
a
fish
worth
eighteen
thousand
francs
a
year
he
has
a
name
a
manner
and
a
certain
position
in
the
world
keep
an
eye
on
them
be
careful
to
gain
isaure
s
confidence
and
if
they
philander
do
not
let
her
send
word
to
him
unless
you
have
seen
it
first
towards
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
isaure
was
standing
beside
a
diminutive
shepherdess
of
the
alps
a
little
woman
of
forty
coquettish
as
a
zerlina
a
footman
announced
that
mme
la
baronne
s
carriage
stops
the
way
and
godefroid
forthwith
saw
his
beautiful
maiden
out
of
a
german
song
draw
her
fantastical
mother
into
the
cloakroom
whither
malvina
followed
them
and
boy
that
he
was
he
must
needs
go
to
discover
into
what
pot
of
preserves
the
infant
joby
had
fallen
and
had
the
pleasure
of
watching
isaure
and
malvina
coaxing
that
sparkling
person
their
mamma
into
her
pelisse
with
all
the
little
tender
precautions
required
for
a
night
journey
in
paris
of
course
the
girls
on
their
side
watched
beaudenord
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
as
kittens
watch
a
mouse
without
seeming
to
see
it
at
all
with
a
certain
satisfaction
beaudenord
noted
the
bearing
manner
and
appearance
of
the
tall
alsacien
servant
in
livery
who
brought
three
pairs
of
overshoes
for
his
mistresses
never
were
two
sisters
more
unlike
than
isaure
and
malvina
malvina
the
elder
was
tall
and
isaure
was
short
and
fair
and
her
features
were
finely
and
delicately
cut
while
her
sister
s
were
vigorous
and
striking
isaure
was
one
of
those
women
who
reign
like
queens
through
their
weakness
such
a
woman
as
a
schoolboy
would
feel
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
protect
malvina
was
the
of
musset
s
poem
as
the
sisters
stood
together
isaure
looked
like
a
miniature
beside
a
portrait
in
oils
she
is
rich
exclaimed
godefroid
going
back
to
rastignac
in
the
ballroom
who
that
young
oh
isaure

aldrigger
why
yes
the
mother
is
a
widow
nucingen
was
once
a
clerk
in

you
want
to
see
them
again
just
turn
off
a
compliment
for
mme

restaud
she
is
giving
a
ball
the
day
after
the
baroness
d

and
her
two
daughters

there
you
will
have

for

godefroid
beheld

in
the
camera
obscura
of
his
brain
isaure
with
her
white
camellias
and
the
little
ways
she
had
with
her
head
saw
her
as
you
see
the
bright
thing
on
which
you
have
been
gazing
after
your
eyes
are
shut
a
picture
grown
somewhat
smaller

radiant

evidently
was
posing

you
might
expect
to
find
a
stout
comfortable
german
compact
and
prudent
with
a
fair
complexion
mellowed
to
the
tint
of
the
foam
on
a
pot
of
beer
and
as
to
virtues
rich
in
all
the
patriarchal
good
qualities
that
germany
possesses
in
romances
that
is
to
say
well
there
was
not
a
gray
hair
in
the
frisky
ringlets
that
she
wore
on
either
side
of
her
face
she
was
still
as
fresh
and
as
brightly
colored
on
the
as
a
nuremberg
doll
her
eyes
were
lively
and
bright
a
bodice
set
off
the
slenderness
of
her

her
brow

temples
were
furrowed
by
a
few
involuntary
wrinkles
which
like
ninon
she
would
fain
have
banished
from
her
head
to
her
heel
but
they
persisted
in
tracing
their
zigzags
in
the
more
conspicuous
place
the
outlines
of
the
nose
had
somewhat
fallen
away
and
the
tip
had
reddened
and
this
was
the
more
awkward
because
it
matched
the
color
on
the
an
only
daughter
and
an
heiress
spoilt
by
her
father
and
mother
spoilt
by
her
husband
and
the
city
of
strasbourg
spoilt
still
by
two
daughters
who
worshiped
their
mother
the
baroness
d
aldrigger
indulged
a
taste
for
rose
color
short
petticoats
and
a
knot
of
ribbon
at
the
point
of
the
corselet
bodice
any
parisian
meeting
the
baroness
on
the
boulevard
would
smile
and
condemn
her
outright
he
does
not
admit
any
plea
of
extenuating
circumstances
like
a
modern
jury
on
a
case
of
fratricide
a
scoffer
is
always
superficial
and
in
consequence
cruel
the
rascal
never
thinks
of
throwing
the
proper
share
of
ridicule
on
society
that
made
the
individual
what
he
is
for
nature
only
makes
dull
animals
of
us
we
owe
the
fool
to
artificial
the
thing
that
i
admire
about
bixiou
is
his
completeness
said
blondet
whenever
he
is
not
gibing
at
others
he
is
laughing
at
i
will
be
even
with
you
for
that
blondet
returned
bixiou
in
a
significant
tone
if
the
little
baroness
was
giddy
careless
selfish
and
incapable
in
practical
matters
she
was
not
accountable
for
her
sins
the
responsibility
is
divided
between
the
firm
of
adolphus
and
company
of
manheim
and
baron
d
aldrigger
with
his
blind
love
for
his
wife
the
baroness
was
a
gentle
as
a
lamb
she
had
a
soft
heart
that
was
very
readily
moved
unluckily
the
emotion
never
lasted
long
but
it
was
all
the
more
frequently
renewed
when
the
baron
died
for
instance
the
shepherdess
all
but
followed
him
to
the
tomb
so
violent
and
sincere
was
her
grief
but
next
morning
there
was
green
peas
at
lunch
she
was
fond
of
green
peas
the
delicious
green
peas
calmed
the
crisis
her
daughters
and
her
servants
loved
her
so
blindly
that
the
whole
household
rejoiced
over
a
circumstance
that
enabled
them
to
hide
the
dolorous
spectacle
of
the
funeral
from
the
sorrowing
baroness
isaure
and
malvina
would
not
allow
their
idolized
mother
to
see
their
tears
while
the
requiem
was
chanted
they
diverted
her
thoughts
to
the
choice
of
mourning
dresses
while
the
coffin
was
placed
in
the
huge
black
and
white
catafalque
that
does
duty
for
some
three
thousand
dead
in
the
course
of
its
career
so
i
was
informed
by
a
mute
whom
i
once
consulted
on
a
point
over
a
couple
of
glasses
of
while
an
indifferent
priest
mumbling
the
office
for
the
dead
do
you
know
what
the
friends
of
the
departed
were
saying
as
all
dressed
in
black
from
head
to
foot
they
sat
or
stood
in
the
church
here
is
the
picture
you
ordered
stay
do
you
see
them
how
much
do
you
suppose
old
d
aldrigger
will
leave
desroches
asked
of
you
remember
taillefer
that
gave
us
the
finest
orgy
ever
known
not
long
before
he
died
he
was
in
treaty
for
practice
in
said
couture
it
was
a
bold
thing
to
do
for
he
was
the
son
of
a
poor
clerk
who
never
made
more
than
eighteen
hundred
francs
a
year
and
his
mother
sold
stamped
paper
but
he
worked
very
hard
from
to
he
was
derville
s
fourth
clerk
when
he
came
and
in
he
was
second
desroches
yes
desroches
like
the
rest
of
us
once
groveled
in
the
poverty
of
job
he
grew
so
tired
of
wearing
coats
too
tight
and
sleeves
too
short
for
him
that
he
swallowed
down
the
law
in
desperation
and
had
just
bought
a
bare
license
he
was
a
licensed
attorney
without
a
penny
or
a
client
or
any
friends
beyond
our
set
and
he
was
bound
to
pay
interest
on
the
and
the
cautionary
deposit
he
used
to
make
me
feel
as
if
i
had
met
a
tiger
escaped
from
the
jardin
des
plantes
said
couture
he
was
lean
and
his
eyes
were
the
color
of
spanish
snuff
and
his
complexion
was
harsh
he
looked
cold
and
phlegmatic
he
was
hard
upon
the
widow
pitiless
to
the
orphan
and
a
terror
to
his
clerks
they
were
not
allowed
to
waste
a
minute
learned
crafty
never
flying
into
a
passion
rancorous
in
his
judicial
but
there
is
goodness
in
him
cried
finot
he
is
devoted
to
his
friends
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
take
godeschal
mariette
s
brother
as
his
at
paris
said
blondet
there
are
attorneys
of
two
shades
there
is
the
honest
man
attorney
he
abides
within
the
province
of
the
law
pushes
on
his
cases
neglects
no
one
never
runs
after
business
gives
his
clients
his
honest
opinion
and
makes
them
compromise
on
doubtful
points
he
is
a
derville
in
short
then
there
is
the
starveling
attorney
to
whom
anything
seems
good
provided
that
he
is
sure
of
expenses
he
will
set
not
mountains
fighting
for
he
sells
them
but
planets
he
will
work
to
make
the
worse
appear
the
better
cause
and
take
advantage
of
a
technical
error
to
win
the
day
for
a
rogue
if
one
of
these
fellows
tries
one
of
maitre
gonin
s
tricks
once
too
often
the
guild
forces
him
to
sell
his
connection
desroches
our
friend
desroches
understood
the
full
resources
of
a
trade
carried
on
in
a
beggarly
way
enough
by
poor
devils
he
would
buy
up
causes
of
men
who
feared
to
lose
the
day
he
plunged
into
chicanery
with
a
fixed
determination
to
make
money
by
it
he
was
right
he
did
his
business
very
honestly
he
found
influence
among
men
in
public
life
by
getting
them
out
of
awkward
complications
there
was
our
dear
les
lupeaulx
for
instance
whose
position
was
so
deeply
compromised
and
desroches
stood
in
need
of
influence
for
when
he
began
he
was
anything
but
well
looked
on
at
the
court
and
he
who
took
so
much
trouble
to
rectify
the
errors
of
his
clients
was
often
in
trouble
himself
see
now
bixiou
to
go
back
to
the
subject
how
came
desroches
to
be
in
the
church
d
aldrigger
is
leaving
seven
or
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
taillefer
answered
addressing
desroches
oh
pooh
there
is
only
one
man
who
knows
how
much
are
worth
put
in
werbrust
a
friend
of
the
deceased
who
that
fat
rogue
nucingen
he
will
go
as
far
as
the
cemetery
d
aldrigger
was
his
master
once
and
out
of
gratitude
he
put
the
old
man
s
capital
into
his
the
widow
will
soon
feel
a
great
what
do
you
mean
well
d
aldrigger
was
so
fond
of
his
wife
now
don
t
laugh
people
are
looking
at
look
here
comes
du
tillet
he
is
very
late
the
epistle
is
just
he
will
marry
the
eldest
girl
in
all
is
it
possible
asked
desroches
why
he
is
tied
more
than
ever
to
mme
he
you
do
not
know
do
you
know
how
nucingen
and
du
tillet
stand
asked
desroches
like
this
said
taillefer
nucingen
is
just
the
man
to
swallow
down
his
old
master
s
capital
and
then
to
disgorge
ugh
ugh
coughed
werbrust
these
churches
are
confoundedly
damp
ugh
ugh
what
do
you
mean
by
disgorge
it
well
nucingen
knows
that
du
tillet
has
a
lot
of
money
he
wants
to
marry
him
to
malvina
but
du
tillet
is
shy
of
nucingen
to
a
the
game
is
good
what
exclaimed
werbrust
is
she
old
enough
to
marry
how
quickly
we
grow
old
malvina
d
aldrigger
is
quite
twenty
years
old
my
dear
fellow
old
d
aldrigger
was
married
in
he
gave
some
rather
fine
entertainments
in
strasbourg
at
the
time
of
his
wedding
and
afterwards
when
malvina
was
born
that
was
in
at
the
peace
of
amiens
and
here
are
we
in
the
year
daddy
werbrust
in
those
days
everything
was
ossianized
he
called
his
daughter
malvina
six
years
afterwards
there
was
a
rage
for
chivalry
pour
la
a
pack
of
nonsense
and
he
christened
his
second
daughter
isaure
she
is
seventeen
so
there
are
two
daughters
to
the
women
will
not
have
a
penny
left
in
ten
years
time
said
werbrust
speaking
to
desroches
in
a
confidential
tone
there
is
d
aldrigger
s
the
old
fellow
bellowing
away
at
the
back
of
the
church
he
has
been
with
them
since
the
two
young
ladies
were
children
and
he
is
capable
of
anything
to
keep
enough
together
for
them
to
live
upon
said
taillefer
from
the
minor
cannons
from
the
choristers
werbrust
from
taillefer
the
puts
me
too
much
in
mind
of
my
poor
i
shall
go
too
it
is
too
damp
in
here
said
werbrust
a
few
halfpence
kind
gentlemen
from
the
beggars
at
the
door
for
the
expenses
of
the
church
from
the
beadle
with
a
rattling
clatter
of
the
from
the
choristers
what
did
he
die
of
from
a
friend
he
broke
a
in
the
heel
from
an
inquisitive
wag
who
is
dead

for

has
been
given
to
us
don
t
ask
for
any
done
to
the
life
cried
couture
and
indeed
it
seemed
to
us
that
we
heard
all
that
went
on
in
the
church
bixiou
imitated
everything
even
the
shuffling
sound
of
the
feet
of
the
men
that
carried
the
coffin
over
the
stone
floor
there
are
poets
and
romancers
and
writers
that
say
many
fine
things
abut
parisian
manners
continued
bixiou
but
that
is
what
really
happens
at
a
funeral
out
of
a
hundred
that
come
to
pay
their
respects
to
some
poor
devil
departed
get
together
and
talk
business
or
pleasure
in
the
middle
of
the
church
to
see
some
poor
little
touch
of
real
sorrow
you
need
an
impossible
combination
of
circumstances
and
after
all
is
there
such
a
thing
as
grief
without
a
thought
of
self
in
it
ugh
said
blondet
nothing
is
less
respected
than
death
is
it
that
there
is
nothing
less
respectable
it
is
so
common
resumed
bixiou
when
the
service
was
over

went
to

a

with
a
great
liking
for
said
du
tillet
and
with
that
epigram
he
cut
nucingen
s
diplomatic
efforts
short
after
dinner
the
baron
de
nucingen
informed
wilhelmine
adolphus
that
she
had
barely
four
hundred
thousand
francs
deposited
with
him
the
daughter
of
adolphus
of
manheim
thus
reduced
to
an
income
of
thousand
livres
lost
herself
in
arithmetical
exercises
that
muddled
her
wits
i
have
had
six
thousand
francs
for
our
dress
allowance
she
said
to
malvina
why
how
did
your
father
find
money
we
shall
have
nothing
now
with
thousand
francs
it
is
destitution
oh
if
my
father
could
see
me
so
come
down
in
the
world
it
would
kill
him
if
he
were
not
dead
already
poor
wilhelmine
and
she
began
to
cry
malvina
puzzled
to
know
how
to
comfort
her
mother
represented
to
her
that
she
was
still
young
and
pretty
that
still
became
her
that
she
could
continue
to
go
to
the
opera
and
the
bouffons
where
mme
de
nucingen
had
a
box
and
so
with
visions
of
gaieties
dances
music
pretty
dresses
and
social
success
the
baroness
was
lulled
to
sleep
and
pleasant
dreams
in
the
blue
bed
in
the
charming
room
next
to
the
chamber
in
which
jean
baptiste
baron
d
aldrigger
had
breathed
his
last
but
two
nights
ago
here
in
a
few
words
is
the
baron
s
history
during
his
lifetime
that
worthy
alsacien
accumulated
about
three
millions
of
francs
in
at
the
age
of
in
the
apogee
of
a
fortune
made
during
the
revolution
he
made
a
marriage
partly
of
ambition
partly
of
inclination
with
the
heiress
of
the
family
of
adolphus
of
manheim
wilhelmine
being
the
idol
of
her
whole
family
naturally
inherited
their
wealth
after
some
ten
years
next
d
aldrigger
s
fortune
being
doubled
he
was
transformed
into
a
baron
by
his
majesty
emperor
and
king
and
forthwith
became
a
fanatical
admirer
of
the
great
man
to
whom
he
owed
his
title
wherefore
between
and
he
ruined
himself
by
a
too
serious
belief
in
the
sun
of
austerlitz
honest
alsacien
as
he
was
he
did
not
suspend
payment
nor
did
he
give
his
creditors
shares
in
doubtful
concerns
by
way
of
settlement
he
paid
everything
over
the
counter
and
retired
from
business
thoroughly
deserving
nucingen
s
comment
on
his
behavior
honest
but
all
claims
satisfied
there
remained
to
him
five
hundred
thousand
francs
and
certain
receipts
for
sums
advanced
to
that
imperial
government
which
had
ceased
to
exist
see
vat
komms
of
too
much
pelief
in
nappolion
said
he
when
he
had
realized
all
his
capital
when
you
have
been
one
of
the
leading
men
in
a
place
how
are
you
to
remain
in
it
when
your
estate
has
dwindled
d
aldrigger
like
all
ruined
provincials
removed
to
paris
there
intrepidly
wore
the
tricolor
braces
embroidered
with
imperial
eagles
and
lived
entirely
in
bonapartist
circles
his
capital
he
handed
over
to
nucingen
who
gave
him
eight
per
cent
upon
it
and
took
over
the
loans
to
the
imperial
government
at
a
mere
sixty
per
cent
of
reduction
wherefore
d
aldrigger
squeezed
nucingen
s
hand
and
said
i
knew
dot
in
you
i
should
find
de
heart
of
ein
nucingen
was
paid
in
full
through
our
friend
des
lupeaulx
well
fleeced
as
d
aldrigger
had
been
he
still
possessed
an
income
of
thousand
francs
but
his
mortification
was
further
complicated
by
the
spleen
which
lies
in
wait
for
the
business
man
so
soon
as
he
retires
from
business
he
set
himself
noble
heart
to
sacrifice
himself
to
his
wife
now
that
her
fortune
was
lost
that
fortune
of
which
she
had
allowed
herself
to
be
despoiled
so
easily
after
the
manner
of
a
girl
entirely
ignorant
of
money
matters
mme
d
aldrigger
accordingly
missed
not
a
single
pleasure
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
any
void
caused
by
the
loss
of
strasbourg
acquaintances
were
speedily
filled
and
more
than
filled
with
paris
gaieties
even
then
as
now
the
nucingens
lived
at
the
higher
end
of
financial
society
and
the
baron
de
nucingen
made
it
a
point
of
honor
to
treat
the
honest
banker
well
his
disinterested
virtue
looked
well
in
the
nucingen
salon
every
winter
dipped
into
d
aldrigger
s
principal
but
he
did
not
venture
to
remonstrate
with
his
pearl
of
a
wilhelmine
his
was
the
most
ingenious
unintelligent
tenderness
in
the
world
a
good
man
but
a
stupid
one
what
will
become
of
them
when
i
am
gone
he
said
as
he
lay
dying
and
when
he
was
left
alone
for
a
moment
with
wirth
his
old
he
struggled
for
breath
to
bid
him
take
care
of
his
mistress
and
her
two
daughters
as
if
the
one
reasonable
being
in
the
house
was
this
alsacien
caleb
balderstone
three
years
afterwards
in
isaure
was
twenty
years
old
and
malvina
still
unmarried
malvina
had
gone
into
society
and
in
course
of
time
discovered
for
herself
how
superficial
their
friendships
were
how
accurately
every
one
was
weighed
and
appraised
like
most
girls
that
have
been
well
brought
up
as
we
say
malvina
had
no
idea
of
the
mechanism
of
life
of
the
importance
of
money
of
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
it
of
the
prices
of
things
and
so
for
six
years
every
lesson
that
she
had
learned
had
been
a
painful
one
for
her
d
aldrigger
s
four
hundred
thousand
francs
were
carried
to
the
credit
of
the
baroness
account
with
the
firm
of
nucingen
she
was
her
husband
s
creditor
for
twelve
hundred
thousand
francs
under
her
marriage
settlement
and
when
in
any
difficulty
the
shepherdess
of
the
alps
dipped
into
her
capital
as
though
it
were
inexhaustible
when
our
pigeon
first
advanced
towards
his
dove
nucingen
knowing
the
baroness
character
must
have
spoken
plainly
to
malvina
on
the
financial
position
at
that
time
three
hundred
thousand
francs
were
left
the
income
of
thousand
francs
was
reduced
to
eighteen
thousand
wirth
had
kept
up
this
state
of
things
for
three
years
after
that
confidential
interview
malvina
put
down
the
carriage
sold
the
horses
and
dismissed
the
coachman
without
her
mother
s
knowledge
the
furniture
now
ten
years
old
could
not
be
renewed
but
it
all
faded
together
and
for
those
that
like
harmony
the
effect
was
not
half
bad
the
baroness
herself
that
so
flower
began
to
look
like
the
last
solitary
rose
on
a
november
bush
i
myself
watched
the
slow
decline
of
luxury
by
and
frightful
upon
my
honor
it
was
my
last
trouble
of
the
kind
afterwards
i
said
to
myself
it
is
silly
to
care
so
much
about
other
but
while
i
was
in
civil
service
i
was
fool
enough
to
take
a
personal
interest
in
the
houses
where
i
dined
i
used
to
stand
up
for
them
i
would
say
no
ill
of
them
myself
i
oh
i
was
a
child
well
when
the
pearl
s
daughter
put
the
state
of
the
case
before
her
oh
my
poor
children
cried
she
who
will
make
my
dresses
now
i
can
not
afford
new
bonnets
i
can
not
see
visitors
here
nor
go
now
by
what
token
do
you
know
that
a
man
is
in
love
said
bixiou
interrupting
himself
the
question
is
whether
beaudenord
was
genuinely
in
love
with
the
he
neglects
his
interests
said
couture
he
changes
his
shirt
three
times
a
day
opined
blondet
a
man
of
more
than
ordinary
ability
can
he
and
ought
he
to
fall
in
love
my
friends
resumed
bixiou
with
a
sentimental
air
there
is
a
kind
of
man
who
when
he
feels
that
he
is
in
peril
of
falling
in
love
will
snap
his
fingers
or
fling
away
his
cigar
as
the
case
may
be
with
a
pooh
there
are
other
women
in
the
beware
of
that
man
for
a
dangerous
reptile
still
the
government
may
employ
that
citizen
somewhere
in
the
foreign
office
blondet
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
godefroid
had
thrown
up
well
he
was
absorbed
said
blondet
love
gives
the
fool
his
one
chance
of
growing
blondet
blondet
how
is
it
that
we
are
so
poor
cried
bixiou
and
why
is
finot
so
rich
returned
blondet
i
will
tell
you
how
it
is
there
my
son
we
understand
each
other
come
there
is
finot
filling
up
my
glass
as
if
i
had
carried
in
his
firewood
at
the
end
of
dinner
one
ought
to
sip
one
s
wine
slowly
well
thou
has
said
the
absorbed
godefroid
became
fully
acquainted
with
the
family
the
tall
malvina
the
frivolous
baroness
and
the
little
lady
of
the
dance
he
became
a
servant
after
the
most
conscientious
and
restricted
fashion
he
was
not
scared
away
by
the
cadaverous
remains
of
opulence
not
he
by
degrees
he
became
accustomed
to
the
threadbare
condition
of
things
it
never
struck
the
young
man
that
the
green
silk
damask
and
white
ornaments
in
the
needed
refurnishing
the
curtains
the
the
on
the
the
rococo
chandelier
the
eastern
carpet
with
the
pile
worn
down
to
the
thread
the
pianoforte
the
little
flowered
china
cups
the
fringed
serviettes
so
full
of
holes
that
they
looked
like
open
work
in
the
spanish
fashion
the
green
with
the
baroness
blue
bedroom
beyond
it
it
was
all
sacred
all
dear
to
him
it
is
only
your
stupid
woman
with
the
brilliant
beauty
that
throws
heart
brain
and
soul
into
the
shade
who
can
inspire
forgetfulness
like
this
a
clever
woman
never
abuses
her
advantages
she
must
be
and
silly
to
gain
such
a
hold
upon
a
man
beaudenord
actually
loved
the
solemn
old
wirth
he
has
told
me
so
himself
that
old
rogue
regarded
his
future
master
with
the
awe
which
a
good
catholic
feels
for
the
eucharist
honest
wirth
was
a
kind
of
gaspard
a
german
sheathing
his
cunning
in
much
as
a
cardinal
in
the
middle
ages
kept
his
dagger
up
his
sleeve
wirth
saw
a
husband
for
isaure
and
accordingly
proceeded
to
surround
godefroid
with
the
mazy
circumlocutions
of
his
alsacien
s
geniality
that
most
adhesive
of
all
known
varieties
of
mme
d
aldrigger
was
radically
she
thought
love
the
most
natural
thing
imaginable
when
isaure
and
malvina
went
out
together
to
the
champs
elysees
or
the
tuileries
where
they
were
sure
to
meet
the
young
men
of
their
set
she
would
simply
say
a
pleasant
time
to
you
dear
their
friends
among
men
the
only
persons
who
might
have
slandered
the
sisters
championed
them
for
the
extraordinary
liberty
permitted
in
the
d
aldriggers
salon
made
it
unique
in
paris
vast
wealth
could
scarcely
have
procured
such
evenings
the
talk
was
good
on
any
subject
dress
was
not
insisted
upon
you
felt
so
much
at
home
there
that
you
could
ask
for
supper
the
sisters
corresponded
as
they
pleased
and
quietly
read
their
letters
by
their
mother
s
side
it
never
occurred
to
the
baroness
to
interfere
in
any
way
the
adorable
woman
gave
the
girls
the
full
benefits
of
her
selfishness
and
in
a
certain
sense
selfish
persons
are
the
easiest
to
live
with
they
hate
trouble
and
therefore
do
not
trouble
other
people
they
never
beset
the
lives
of
their
with
thorny
advice
and
captious
nor
do
they
torment
you
with
the
waspish
solicitude
of
excessive
affection
that
must
know
all
things
and
rule
all
things
this
comes
home
said
blondet
but
my
dear
fellow
this
is
not
telling
a
story
this
is
blondet
if
you
were
not
tipsy
i
should
really
feel
hurt
he
is
the
one
serious
literary
character
among
us
for
his
benefit
i
honor
you
by
treating
you
like
men
of
taste
i
am
distilling
my
tale
for
you
and
now
he
criticises
me
there
is
no
greater
proof
of
intellectual
sterility
my
friends
than
the
piling
up
of
facts
that
supreme
comedy
shows
us
that
art
consists
in
the
power
of
building
a
palace
on
a
needle
s
point
the
gist
of
my
idea
is
in
the
fairy
wand
which
can
turn
the
desert
into
an
interlaken
in
ten
seconds
precisely
the
time
required
to
empty
this
glass
would
you
rather
that
i
fired
off
at
you
like
a
or
a
s
report
we
chat
and
laugh
and
this
journalist
a
bibliophobe
when
sober
expects
me
forsooth
when
he
is
drunk
to
teach
my
tongue
to
move
at
the
dull
jogtrot
of
a
printed
here
he
affected
to
weep
woe
unto
the
french
imagination
when
men
fain
would
blunt
the
needle
points
of
her
pleasant
humor
let
us
weep
for
long
live
the
of
pure
and
the
systems
in
five
closely
packed
volumes
printed
by
germans
who
little
suspect
that
the
gist
of
the
matter
has
been
known
in
paris
since
and
crystallized
in
a
few
trenchant
words
the
diamonds
of
our
national
thought
blondet
is
driving
a
hearse
to
his
own
suicide
blondet
forsooth
who
manufactures
newspaper
accounts
of
the
last
words
of
all
the
great
men
that
die
without
saying
anything
come
get
on
put
in
finot
it
was
my
intention
to
explain
to
you
in
what
the
happiness
of
a
man
consists
when
he
is
not
a
shareholder
out
of
compliment
to
couture
well
now
do
you
not
see
at
what
a
price
godefroid
secured
the
greatest
happiness
of
a
young
man
s
dreams
he
was
trying
to
understand
isaure
by
way
of
making
sure
that
she
should
understand
him
things
which
comprehend
one
another
must
needs
be
similar
infinity
and
nothingness
for
instance
are
like
everything
that
lies
between
the
two
is
like
neither
nothingness
is
stupidity
genius
infinity
the
lovers
wrote
each
other
the
stupidest
letters
imaginable
putting
down
various
expressions
then
in
fashion
upon
bits
of
scented
paper
angel
aeolian
harp
with
thee
i
shall
be
complete
there
is
a
heart
in
my
man
s
breast
weak
woman
poor
me
all
the
latest
it
was
godefroid
s
wont
to
stay
in
a
for
a
bare
ten
minutes
he
talked
without
any
pretension
to
the
women
in
it
and
at
these
times
they
thought
him
very
clever
in
short
judge
of
his
absorption
joby
his
horses
and
carriages
became
secondary
interests
in
his
life
he
was
never
happy
except
in
the
depths
of
a
snug
settee
opposite
the
baroness
by
the
porphyry
watching
isaure
taking
tea
and
chatting
with
the
little
circle
of
friends
that
dropped
in
every
evening
between
eleven
and
twelve
in
the
rue
joubert
you
could
play
bouillotte
there
safely
i
always
won
isaure
sat
with
one
little
foot
thrust
out
in
its
black
satin
shoe
godefroid
would
gaze
and
gaze
and
stay
till
every
one
else
was
gone
and
say
give
me
your
shoe
and
isaure
would
put
her
little
foot
on
a
chair
and
take
it
off
and
give
it
to
him
with
a
glance
one
of
those
glances
that
in
short
you
understand
at
length
godefroid
discovered
a
great
mystery
in
malvina
whenever
du
tillet
knocked
at
the
door
the
live
red
that
colored
malvina
s
face
said
ferdinand
when
the
poor
girl
s
eyes
fell
on
that
tiger
they
lighted
up
like
a
brazier
fanned
by
a
current
of
air
when
ferdinand
drew
her
away
to
the
window
or
a
side
table
she
betrayed
her
secret
infinite
joy
it
is
a
rare
and
wonderful
thing
to
see
a
woman
so
much
in
love
that
she
loses
her
cunning
to
be
strange
and
you
can
read
her
heart
as
rare
dear
me
in
paris
as
the
singing
flower
in
the
indies
but
in
spite
of
a
friendship
dating
from
the
d
aldriggers
first
appearance
at
the
nucingens
ferdinand
did
not
marry
malvina
our
ferocious
friend
was
not
apparently
jealous
of
desroches
who
paid
assiduous
court
to
the
young
lady
desroches
wanted
to
pay
off
the
rest
of
the
due
for
his
connection
malvina
could
not
well
have
less
than
fifty
thousand
crowns
he
thought
and
so
the
lawyer
was
fain
to
play
the
lover
malvina
deeply
humiliated
as
she
was
by
du
tillet
s
carelessness
loved
him
too
well
to
shut
the
door
upon
him
with
her
an
enthusiastic
sensitive
girl
love
sometimes
got
the
better
of
pride
and
pride
again
overcame
wounded
love
our
friend
ferdinand
cool
and
accepted
her
tenderness
and
breathed
the
atmosphere
with
the
quiet
enjoyment
of
a
tiger
licking
the
blood
that
dyes
his
throat
he
would
come
to
make
sure
of
it
with
new
proofs
he
never
allowed
two
days
to
pass
without
a
visit
to
the
rue
joubert
at
that
time
the
rascal
possessed
something
like
eighteen
hundred
thousand
francs
money
must
have
weighted
very
little
with
him
in
the
question
of
marriage
and
he
had
not
merely
been
proof
against
malvina
he
had
resisted
the
barons
de
nucingen
and
de
rastignac
though
both
of
them
had
set
him
galloping
at
the
rate
of
leagues
a
day
with
outriders
regardless
of
expense
through
mazes
of
their
cunning
devices
and
with
never
a
clue
of
thread
godefroid
could
not
refrain
from
saying
a
word
to
his
future
as
to
her
ridiculous
position
between
a
banker
and
an
attorney
you
mean
to
read
me
a
lecture
on
the
subject
of
ferdinand
she
said
frankly
to
know
the
secret
between
us
dear
godefroid
never
mention
this
again
ferdinand
s
birth
antecedents
and
fortune
count
for
nothing
in
this
so
you
may
think
it
is
something
a
few
days
afterwards
however
malvina
took
godefroid
apart
to
say
i
do
not
think
that
desroches
is
sincere
such
is
the
instinct
of
love
he
would
like
to
marry
me
and
he
is
paying
court
to
some
tradesman
s
daughter
as
well
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
whether
i
am
a
second
shift
and
whether
marriage
is
a
matter
of
money
with
the
fact
was
that
desroches
deep
as
he
was
could
not
make
out
du
tillet
and
was
afraid
that
he
might
marry
malvina
so
the
fellow
had
secured
his
retreat
his
position
was
intolerable
he
was
scarcely
paying
his
expenses
and
interest
on
the
debt
women
understand
nothing
of
these
things
for
them
love
is
always
a
but
since
neither
du
tillet
nor
desroches
married
her
just
explain
ferdinand
s
motive
said
finot
motive
repeated
bixiou
why
this
general
rule
a
girl
that
has
once
given
away
her
slipper
even
if
she
refused
it
for
ten
years
is
never
married
by
the
man
who
bosh
interrupted
blondet
one
reason
for
loving
is
the
fact
that
one
has
loved
his
motive
here
it
is
general
rule
do
not
marry
as
a
sergeant
when
some
day
you
may
be
duke
of
dantzig
and
marshal
of
france
now
see
what
a
match
du
tillet
has
made
since
then
he
married
one
of
the
comte
de
granville
s
daughters
into
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
the
french
desroches
mother
had
a
friend
a
druggist
s
wife
continued
bixiou
said
druggist
had
retired
with
a
fat
fortune
these
druggist
folk
have
absurdly
crude
notions
by
way
of
giving
his
daughter
a
good
education
he
had
sent
her
to
a
well
matifat
meant
the
girl
to
marry
well
on
the
strength
of
two
hundred
thousand
francs
good
hard
coin
with
no
scent
of
drugs
about
florine
s
matifat
asked
blondet
well
yes
lousteau
s
matifat
ours
in
fact
the
matifats
even
then
lost
to
us
had
gone
to
live
in
the
rue
du
as
far
as
may
be
from
the
rue
des
lombards
where
their
money
was
made
for
my
own
part
i
had
cultivated
those
matifats
while
i
served
my
time
in
the
galleys
of
the
law
when
i
was
cooped
up
for
eight
hours
out
of
the
with
nincompoops
of
the
first
water
i
saw
queer
characters
enough
to
convince
myself
that
all
is
not
even
in
obscure
places
and
that
in
the
flattest
inanity
you
may
chance
upon
an
angle
yes
dear
boy
such
and
such
a
philistine
is
to
such
another
as
raphael
is
to
natoire
mme
desroches
the
widowed
mother
had
long
ago
planned
this
marriage
for
her
son
in
spite
of
a
tremendous
obstacle
which
took
the
shape
of
one
cochin
matifat
s
partner
s
son
a
young
clerk
in
the
adult
department
and
mme
matifat
were
of
the
opinion
that
an
attorney
s
position
gave
some
guarantee
for
a
wife
s
happiness
to
use
their
own
expression
and
as
for
desroches
he
was
prepared
to
fall
in
with
his
mother
s
views
in
case
he
could
do
no
better
for
himself
wherefore
he
kept
up
his
acquaintance
with
the
druggists
in
the
rue
du
to
put
another
kind
of
happiness
before
you
you
should
have
a
description
of
these
shopkeepers
male
and
female
they
rejoiced
in
the
possession
of
a
handsome
ground
floor
and
a
strip
of
garden
for
amusement
they
watched
a
little
squirt
of
water
no
bigger
than
a
cornstalk
perpetually
rising
and
falling
upon
a
small
round
freestone
slab
in
the
middle
of
a
basin
some
six
feet
across
they
would
rise
early
of
a
morning
to
see
if
the
plants
in
the
garden
had
grown
in
the
night
they
had
nothing
to
do
they
were
restless
they
dressed
for
the
sake
of
dressing
bored
themselves
at
the
theatre
and
were
for
ever
going
to
and
fro
between
paris
and
luzarches
where
they
had
a
country
house
i
have
dined
there
once
they
tried
to
quiz
me
blondet
i
told
them
a
story
that
lasted
from
nine
o
clock
till
midnight
one
tale
inside
another
i
had
just
brought
my
personage
upon

a

wrote

pretty

knew
french

and

a
complete

in
short
she
was
impatient
enough
to
be
married
and
leave
the
paternal
roof
finding
it
as
dull
at
home
as
a
lieutenant
finds

upon

i
determined
to
reveal

to

when
godefroid
came
in
to
give
his

to

a
word
here
and
there
reached
his

he
guessed
the
matter
on
foot
more
particularly
from

look
of
satisfaction
that
it
was

had
suspected

actually
stopped

there

took
his
departure
when
the

went
to

as
soon
as

was
left
alone
with

he
spoke
in
a
fatherly
fashion
dear
child
please
to
bear
in
mind
that
a
poor
fellow
heavy
with
sleep
has
been
drinking
tea
to
keep
himself
awake
till
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
all
for
a
chance
of
saying
a
solemn
word
of
advice
to
you
do
not
be
too
particular
do
not
brood
over
your
feelings
never
mind
the
sordid
schemes
of
men
that
have
one
foot
here
and
another
in
the
matifats
house
do
not
stop
to
think
at
all
marry
when
a
girl
marries
it
means
that
the
man
whom
she
marries
undertakes
to
maintain
her
in
a
more
or
less
good
position
in
life
and
at
any
rate
her
comfort
is
assured
i
know
the
world
girls
mammas
and
grandmammas
are
all
of
them
hypocrites
when
they
fly
off
into
sentiment
over
a
question
of
marriage
nobody
really
thinks
of
anything
but
a
good
position
if
a
mother
marries
her
daughter
well
she
says
that
she
has
made
an
excellent
here
rastignac
unfolded
his
theory
of
marriage
which
to
his
way
of
thinking
is
a
business
arrangement
with
a
view
to
making
life
tolerable
and
ended
up
with
i
do
not
ask
to
know
your
secret
malvina
i
know
it
already
men
talk
things
over
among
themselves
just
as
you
women
talk
after
you
leave
the
this
is
all
i
have
to
say
marry
if
you
do
not
remember
that
i
begged
you
to
marry
here
in
this
room
this
evening
there
was
a
certain
ring
in
rastignac
s
voice
which
compelled
not
attention
but
reflection
there
was
something
startling
in
his
insistence
something
that
went
as
rastignac
meant
that
it
should
to
the
quick
of
malvina
s
intelligence
she
thought
over
the
counsel
again
next
day
and
vainly
asked
herself
why
it
had
been
couture
broke
in
in
all
these

that
you
have
set
spinning
i

nothing
at

of

apparently

you

followed
the

forty
thousand

which
so
many
people
envy

this

rastignac
held
the
threads
of
all
these
lives
in
his
desroches
the
matifats

the

and
a
hundred
others
assented
bixiou
oh
come
now
how
cried
finot
i
know
a
few
things
but
i
can
not
see
a
glimpse
of
an
answer
to
this
blondet
has
roughly
given
you
the
account
of
nucingen
s
first
two
suspensions
of
payment
now
for
the
third
with
full
after
the
peace
of
nucingen
grasped
an
idea
which
some
of
us
only
fully
understood
later
to
wit
that
capital
is
a
power
only
when
you
are
very
much
richer
than
other
people
in
his
own
mind
he
was
jealous
of
the
rothschilds
he
had
five
millions
of
francs
he
wanted
ten
he
knew
a
way
to
make
thirty
millions
with
ten
while
with
five
he
could
only
make
fifteen
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
operate
a
third
suspension
of
payment
about
that
time
the
great
man
hit
on
the
idea
of
indemnifying
his
creditors
with
paper
of
purely
fictitious
value
and
keeping
their
coin
on
the
market
a
great
idea
of
this
sort
is
not
expressed
in
precisely
this
way
such
an
arrangement
consists
in
giving
a
lot
of
children
a
small
pie
in
exchange
for
a
gold
piece
and
like
children
of
a
smaller
growth
they
prefer
the
pie
to
the
gold
piece
not
suspecting
that
they
might
have
a
couple
of
hundred
pies
for
what
is
this
all
about
bixiou
cried
couture
nothing
more
not
a
week
passes
but
pies
are
offered
to
the
public
for
a
louis
but
who
compels
the
public
to
take
them
are
they
not
perfectly
free
to
make
inquiries
you
would
rather
have
it
made
compulsory
to
take
up
shares
would
you
asked
blondet
no
said
finot
where
would
the
talent
come
in
very
good
for
who
put
him
up
to
it
asked
couture
the
fact
was
continued
bixiou
that
nucingen
had
twice
had
the
luck
to
present
the
public
quite
unintentionally
with
a
pie
that
turned
out
to
be
worth
more
than
the
money
he
received
for
it
that
unlucky
good
luck
gave
him
qualms
of
conscience
a
course
of
such
luck
is
fatal
to
a
man
in
the
long
run
this
time
he
meant
to
make
no
mistake
of
this
sort
he
waited
ten
years
for
an
opportunity
of
issuing
negotiable
securities
which
should
seem
on
the
face
of
it
to
be
worth
something
while
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
if
you
look
at
banking
in
that
light
broke
in
couture
no
sort
of
business
would
be
possible
more
than
one
banker
backed
up
by
a
government
has
induced
the
men
on
change
to
take
up
stock
which
is
bound
to
fall
within
a
given
time
you
have
seen
better
than
that
have
you
not
seen
stock
created
with
the
concurrence
of
a
government
to
pay
the
interest
upon
older
stock
so
as
to
keep
things
going
and
tide
over
the
difficulty
these
operations
were
more
or
less
like
nucingen
s
the
thing
may
look
queer
on
a
small
scale
said
blondet
but
on
a
large
we
call
it
finance
there
are
proceedings
criminal
between
man
and
man
that
amount
to
nothing
when
spread
out
over
any
number
of
men
much
as
a
drop
of
prussic
acid
becomes
harmless
in
a
pail
of
water
you
take
a
man
s
life
you
are
guillotined
but
if
for
any
political
conviction
whatsoever
you
take
five
hundred
lives
political
crimes
are
respected
you
take
five
thousand
francs
out
of
my
desk
to
the
hulks
you
go
but
with
a
sop
cleverly
pushed
into
the
jaws
of
a
thousand
speculators
you
can
cram
the
stock
of
any
bankrupt
republic
or
monarchy
down
their
throats
even
if
the
loan
has
been
floated
as
couture
says
to
pay
the
interest
on
that
very
same
national
debt
nobody
can
complain
these
are
the
real
principles
of
the
present
golden
when
the
stage
machinery
is
so
huge
continued
bixiou
a
good
many
puppets
are
required
in
the
first
place
nucingen
had
purposely
and
with
his
eyes
open
invested
his
five
millions
in
an
american
investment
foreseeing
that
the
profits
would
not
come
in
until
it
was
too
late
the
firm
of
nucingen
deliberately
emptied
its
coffers
any
liquidation
ought
to
be
brought
about
naturally
in
deposits
belonging
to
private
individuals
and
other
investments
the
firm
possessed
about
six
millions
of
capital
altogether
among
those
private
individuals
was
the
baroness
d
aldrigger
with
her
three
hundred
thousand
francs
beaudenord
with
four
hundred
thousand
d

with
a
million

with
three
hundred
thousand
charles
grandet
who
married
mlle
d
aubrion
with
half
a
million
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
now
if
nucingen
had
himself
brought
out
a
company
with
the
shares
of
which
he
proposed
to
indemnify
his
creditors
after
more
or
less
ingenious
manoeuvring
he
might
perhaps
have
been
suspected
he
set
about
it
more
cunningly
than
that
he
made
some
one
else
put
up
the
machinery
that
was
to
play
the
part
of
the
mississippi
scheme
in

s
system
nucingen
can
make
the
men
work
out
schemes
for
him
without
confiding
a
word
to
them
it
is
his
peculiar
talent
nucingen
just
let
fall
a
hint
to
du
tillet
of
the
pyramidal
triumphant
notion
of
bringing
out
a
enterprise
with
capital
sufficient
to
pay
very
high
dividends
for
a
time
tried
for
the
first
time
in
days
when
noodles
with
capital
were
plentiful
the
plan
was
pretty
sure
to
end
in
a
run
upon
the
shares
and
consequently
in
a
profit
for
the
banker
that
issued
them
you
must
remember
that
this
happened
in
du
tillet
struck
through
he
was
by
an
idea
both
pregnant
and
ingenious
naturally
bethought
himself
that
if
the
enterprise
failed
the
blame
must
fall
upon
somebody
for
which
reason
it
occurred
to
him
to
put
forward
a
figurehead
director
in
charge
of
his
commercial
machinery
at
this
day
you
know
the
secret
of
the
firm
of
claparon
and
company
founded
by
du
tillet
one
of
the
finest
inventions
yes
said
blondet
the
responsible
editor
in
business
matters
the
instigator
and
scapegoat
but
we
know
better
than
that
nowadays
we
put
apply
at
the
offices
of
the

such
and
such
a
number
such
and

nucingen
pursued
bixiou
had
supported
the
firm
of
charles
claparon
and
company
with
all
his
credit
there
were
markets
in
which
you
might
safely
put
a
million
francs
worth
of
claparon
s
paper
so
du
tillet
proposed
to
bring
his
firm
of
claparon
to
the
fore
so
said
so
done
in
the
shareholder
was
still
an
unsophisticated
being
there
was
no
such
thing
as
cash
lying
at
call
managing
directors
did
not
pledge
themselves
not
to
put
their
own
shares
upon
the
market
they
kept
no
deposit
with
the
bank
of
france
they
guaranteed
nothing
they
did
not
even
condescend
to
explain
to
shareholders
the
exact
limits
of
their
liabilities
when
they
informed
them
that
the
directors
in
their
goodness
refrained
from
asking
any
more
than
a
thousand
or
five
hundred
or
even
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
it
was
not
given
out
that
the
experiment
in
was
not
meant
to
last
for
more
than
seven
five
or
even
three
years
so
that
shareholders
would
not
have
long
to
wait
for
the
catastrophe
it
was
in
the
childhood
of
the
art
promoters
did
not
even
publish
the
gigantic
prospectuses
with
which
they
stimulate
the
imagination
and
at
the
same
time
make
demands
for
money
of
all
and
that
only
comes
when
nobody
wishes
to
part
with
money

things
in

as

says
put
thus
artlessly
before
the

and
backed
up
by
the
opinions
of
experts
the
princes
of

were
negotiated
shamefacedly
in
the
silence
and

of

exploit
the

in
his
own

on

in

so
they
reached
him
by
means
of
the
skilfully
created
rumor
which
grew
till
it
reached
a
of
a
quotation
in
four

and
as
we
can
say
anything
among
ourselves
said

on

cerizet

just
been
condemned
on

i
maintain
that
the

is
infinitely
less
fraudulent
less
ruinous
more
straightforward
than

exclaimed
bixiou
here
comes

continued
couture
taking
no
notice
of
the
interruption
every
government
that
meddles
with
commerce
and
can
not
leave
it
free
sets
about
an
expensive
piece
of
folly
state
interference
ends
in
a
or
a
monopoly
to
my
thinking
few
things
can
be
more
in
conformity
with
the
principles
of
free
trade
than
companies
state
interference
means
that
you
try
to
regulate
the
relations
of
principal
and
interest
which
is
absurd
in
business
generally
speaking
the
profits
are
in

the
risks

does
it

the

you

you
invest

you
are

nine

out
of

that
you

turns
out

oh

it

there
chaff
away
very
well
the

in

hits
on

those

gentlemen
let
us
admit
among
ourselves
that
those
who
call
out

hypocrites
desperately
vexed
because
they
have
no
good

of

neither

you

not

in

short

you
will
see
the

descend
into

in

columns
you
will
see
that
their
claws
are
longer
their
morality
more
crooked
than
ours
while
they
have
not
our

points
what
a
head
a
man
must
have
if
he
has
to
found
a
business
in
times
when
the
shareholder
is
as
covetous
and
keen
as
the
inventor
what
a
great
magnetizer
must
he
be
that
can
create
a
claparon
and
hit
upon
expedients
never
tried
before
do
you
know
the
moral
of
it
all
our
age
is
no
better
than
we
are
we
live
in
an
era
of
greed
no
one
troubles
himself
about
the
intrinsic
value
of
a
thing
if
he
can
only
make
a
profit
on
it
by
selling
it
to
somebody
else
so
he
passes
it
on
to
his
neighbor
the
shareholder
that
thinks
he

is
just
as
covetous

what
times
we

when
the

appears
among

it
is
promptly
quenched
by
haphazard

almost
all
our

come
up
from
little
parishes
where
they
studied
human

through
the
medium
of

forthwith
they
shut

nothing
nowadays

no

oh
bravo
blondet
cried
bixiou
thou
hast
set
thy
finger
on
the
weak
spot
meddlesome
taxation
has
lost
us
more
victories
here
in
france
than
the
vexatious
chances
of

i
once
spent
seven
years
in
the
hulks
of
a
government
department
chained
with
bourgeois
to
my
bench
there
was
a
clerk
in
the
office
a
man
with
a
head
on
his
shoulders
he
had
set
his
mind
upon
making
a
sweeping
reform
of
the
whole
fiscal
system
ah
well
we
took
the
conceit
out
of
him
nicely
france
might
have
been
too
prosperous
you
know
she
might
have
amused
herself
by
conquering
europe
again
we
acted
in
the
interests
of
the
peace
of
nations
i
slew
rabourdin
with

aka

do
not

i
use
the
word
in
its
wide
political
sense
rejoined
blondet
explain
your
meaning
said
finot
here
it
is
returned
blondet
there
has
been
a
good
deal
said
about
affairs
at
lyons
about
the
republic
cannonaded
in
the
streets
well
there
was
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
all
the
republic
took
up
the
riots
just
as
an
insurgent
snatches
up
a
rifle
the
truth
is
queer
and
profound
i
can
tell
you
the
lyons
trade
is
a
soulless
trade
they
will
not
weave
a
yard
of
silk
unless
they
have
the
order
and
are
sure
of
payment
if
orders
fall
off
the
workmen
may
starve
they
can
scarcely
earn
a
living
convicts
are
better
off
after
the
revolution
of
july
the
distress
reached
such
a
pitch
that
the
lyons
weavers
the
as
they
call
them
hoisted
the
flag
bread
or
death
a
proclamation
of
a
kind
which
compels
the
attention
of
a
government
it
was
really
brought
about
by
the
cost
of
living
at
lyons
lyons
must
build
theatres
and
become
a
metropolis
forsooth
and
the
octroi
duties
accordingly
were
insanely
high
the
republicans
got
wind
of
this
bread
riot
they
organized
the
in
two
camps
and
fought
among
themselves
lyons
had
her
three
days
but
order
was
restored
and
the
silk
weavers
went
back
to
their
dens
hitherto
the
had
been
honest
the
silk
for
his
work
was
weighed
out
to
him
in
hanks
and
he
brought
back
the
same
weight
of
woven
tissue
now
he
made
up
his
mind
that
the
silk
merchants
were
oppressing
him
he
put
honesty
out
at
the
door
and
rubbed
oil
on
his
fingers
he
still
brought
back
weight
for
weight
but
he
sold
the
silk
represented
by
the
oil
and
the
french
silk
trade
has
suffered
from
a
plague
of
greased
silks
which
might
have
ruined
lyons
and
a
whole
branch
of
french
commerce
the
masters
and
the
government
instead
of
removing
the
causes
of
the
evil
simply
drove
it
in
with
a
violent
external
application
they
ought
to
have
sent
a
clever
man
to
lyons
one
of
those
men
that
are
said
to
have
no
principle
an
abbe
terray
but
they
looked
at
the
affair
from
a
military
point
of
view
the
result
of
the
troubles
is
a
de
at
forty
per
yard
the
silk
is
sold
at
this
day
i
dare
say
and
the
masters
no
doubt
have
hit
upon
some
new
check
upon
the
men
this
method
of
manufacturing
without
looking
ahead
ought
never
to
have
existed
in
the
country
where
one
of
the
greatest
citizens
that
france
has
ever
known
ruined
himself
to
keep
six
thousand
weavers
in
work
without
orders
richard
lenoir
fed
them
and
the
government
was
thickheaded
enough
to
allow
him
to
suffer
from
the
fall
of
the
prices
of
textile
fabrics
brought
about
by
the
revolution
of
richard
lenoir
is
the
one
case
of
a
merchant
that
deserves
a
statue
and
yet
the
subscription
set
on
foot
for
him
has
no
subscribers
while
the
fund
for
general
foy
s
children
reached
a
million
francs
lyons
has
drawn
her
own
conclusions
she
knows
france
she
knows
that
there
is
no
religion
left
the
story
of
richard
lenoir
is
one
of
those
blunders
which
fouche
condemned
as
worse
than
a
suppose
that
there
is
a
tinge
of
charlatanism
in
the
way
in
which
concerns
are
put
before
the
public
began

returning
to
the
charge
that
word
charlatanism
has
come
to
be
a
damaging
expression
a
middle
term
as
it
were
between
right
and
wrong
for
where
i
ask
you
does
charlatanism
begin
where
does
it
end
what
is
charlatanism
do
me
the
kindness
of
telling
me
what
it
is
now
for
a
little
plain
speaking
the
rarest
social
ingredient
a
business
which
should
consist
in
going
out
at
night
to
look
for
goods
to
sell
in
the
day
would
obviously
be
impossible
you
find
the
instinct
of
forestalling
the
market
in
the
very
how
to
forestall
the
market
that
is
the
one
idea
of
the
honest
tradesman
of
the
rue
as
of
the
most
speculator
if
stocks
are
heavy
sell
you
must
if
sales
are
slow
you
must
tickle
your
customer

the
signs
of

middle

hence

modern

not

attracting
custom
and
forcing
your
goods
upon
the
consumer
it
may
happen
it
is
sure
to
happen
it
often
happens
that
a
shopkeeper
gets
hold
of
damaged
goods
for
the
seller
always
cheats
the
buyer
go
and
ask
the
most
upright
folk
in
paris
the
best
known
men
in
business
that
is

they
will
all
triumphantly
tell
you
of
dodges
by
which
they
passed
off
stock
which
they
knew
to
be
bad
upon
the
public
the
firm
of
minard
began
by
sales
of
this
kind
in
the
rue
they
sell
nothing
but
greased
silk
it
is
all
that
they
can
do
the
most
honest
merchants
tell
you
in
the
most
candid
way
that
you
must
get
out
of
a
bad
bargain
as
best
you
can
a
motto
for
the
most
unscrupulous
rascality
blondet
has
given
you
an
account
of
the
lyons
affair
its
causes
and
effects
and
i
proceed
in
my
turn
to
illustrate
my
theory
with
an
anecdote
there
was
once
a
woolen
weaver
an
ambitious
man
burdened
with
a
large
family
of
children
by
a
wife
too
much
beloved
he
put
too
much
faith
in
the
republic
laid
in
a
stock
of
scarlet
wool
and
manufactured
those
caps
that
you
may
have
noticed
on
the
heads
of
all
the
street
urchins
in
paris
how
this
came
about
i
am
just
going
to
tell
you
the
republic
was
beaten
after
the
affair
the
caps
were
quite
unsalable
now
when
a
weaver
finds
that
besides
a
wife
and
children
he
has
some
ten
thousand
red
woolen
caps
in
the
house
and
that
no
hatter
will
take
a
single
one
of
them
notions
begin
to
pass
through
his
head
as
fast
as
if
he
were
a
banker
racking
his
brains
to
get
rid
of
ten
million
francs
worth
of
shares
in
some
dubious
investment
as
for
this
law
of
the
faubourg
this
nucingen
of
caps
do
you
know
what
he
did
he
went
to
find
a
pothouse
dandy
one
of
those
comic
men
that
drive
police
sergeants
to
despair
at
dancing
saloons
at
the
barriers
him
he
engaged
to
play
the
part
of
an
american
captain
staying
at
meurice
s
and
buying
for
export
trade
he
was
to
go
to
some
large
hatter
who
still
had
a
cap
in
his
shop
window
and
inquire
for
ten
thousand
red
woolen
caps
the
hatter
scenting
business
in
the
wind
hurried
round
to
the
woolen
weaver
and
rushed
upon
the
stock
after
that
no
more
of
the
american
captain
you
understand
and
great
plenty
of
caps
if
you
interfere
with
the
freedom
of
trade
because
free
trade
has
its
drawbacks
you
might
as
well
tie
the
hands
of
justice
because
a
crime
sometimes
goes
unpunished
or
blame
the
bad
organization
of
society
because
civilization
produces
some
evils
from
the
caps
and
the
rue
to
companies
and
the
bank
draw
your
own
a
crown
for
couture
said
blondet
twisting
a
serviette
into
a
wreath
for
his
head
i
go
further
than
that
gentlemen
if
there
is
a
defect
in
the
working
hypothesis
what
is
the
cause
the
law
the
whole
system
of
legislation
the
blame
rests
with
the
legislature
the
great
men
of
their
districts
are
sent
up
to
us
by
the
provinces
crammed
with
parochial
notions
of
right
and
wrong
and
ideas
that
are
indispensable
if
you
want
to
keep
clear
of
collisions
with
justice
are
stupid
when
they
prevent
a
man
from
rising
to
the
height
at
which
a
maker
of
the
laws
ought
to
abide
legislation
may
prohibit
such
and
such
developments
of
human
passions
gambling
lotteries
the
ninons
of
the
pavement
anything
you
please
but
you
can
not
extirpate
the
passions
themselves
by
any
amount
of
legislation
abolish
them
you
would
abolish
the
society
which
develops
them
even
if
it
does
not
produce
them
the
gambling
passion
lurks
for
instance
at
the
bottom
of
every
heart
be
it
a
girl
s
heart
a
provincial
s
a
diplomatist
s
everybody
longs
to
have
money
without
working
for
it
you
may
hedge
the
desire
about
with
restrictions
but
the
gambling
mania
immediately
breaks
out
in
another
form
you
stupidly
suppress
lotteries
but
the
pilfers
none
the
less
and
puts
her
gains
in
the
savings
bank
she
gambles
with
two
hundred
and
fifty
franc
stakes
instead
of
forty
sous
companies
and
speculation
take
the
place
of
the
lottery
the
gambling
goes
on
without
the
green
cloth
the
croupier
s
rake
is
invisible
the
cheating
planned
beforehand
the
gambling
houses
are
closed
the
lottery
has
come
to
an
end
and
now
cry
idiots
morals
have
greatly
improved
in
france
as
if
forsooth
they
had
suppressed
the
punters
the
gambling
still
goes
on
only
the
state
makes
nothing
from
it
now
and
for
a
tax
paid
with
pleasure
it
has
substituted
a
burdensome
duty
nor
is
the
number
of
suicides
reduced
for
the
gambler
never
dies
though
his
victim
i
am
not
speaking
now
of
foreign
capital
lost
to
france
continued
couture
nor
of
the
frankfort
lotteries
the
convention
passed
a
decree
of
death
against
those
who
hawked
foreign
and
used
to
traffic
in
them
so
much
for
the
sense
of
our
legislator
and
his
driveling
philanthropy
the
encouragement
given
to
savings
banks
is
a
piece
of
crass
political
folly
suppose
that
things
take
a
doubtful
turn
and
people
lose
confidence
the
government
will
find
that
they
have
instituted
a
queue
for
money
like
the
queues
outside
the
bakers
shops
so
many
savings
banks
so
many
riots
three
street
boys
hoist
a
flag
in
some
corner
or
other
and
you
have
a
revolution
ready
made
but
this
danger
however
great
it
may
be
seems
to
me
less
to
be
dreaded
than
the
widespread
demoralization
savings
banks
are
a
means
of
inoculating
the
people
the
classes
least
restrained
by
education
or
by
reason
from
schemes
that
are
tacitly
criminal
with
the
vices
bred
of
see
what
comes
of
philanthropy
a
great
politician
ought
to
be
without
a
conscience
in
abstract
questions
or
he
is
a
bad
steersman
for
a
nation
an
honest
politician
is
a
with
feelings
a
pilot
that
would
make
love
at
the
helm
and
let
the
ship
go
down
a
prime
minister
who
helps
himself
to
millions
but
makes
france
prosperous
and
great
is
preferable
is
he
not
to
a
public
servant
who
ruins
his
country
even
though
he
is
buried
at
the
public
expense
would
you
hesitate
between
a
richelieu
a
mazarin
or
a
potemkin
each
with
his
hundreds
of
millions
of
francs
and
a
conscientious
robert
lindet
that
could
make
nothing
out
of
assignats
and
national
property
or
one
of
the
virtuous
imbeciles
who
ruined
louis
go
on
i
will
not
go
into
the
details
of
the
speculation
which
we
owe
to
nucingen
s
financial
genius
it
would
be
the
more
inexpedient
because
the
concern
is
still
in
existence
and
shares
are
quoted
on
the
bourse
the
scheme
was
so
convincing
there
was
such
life
in
an
enterprise
sanctioned
by
royal
letters
patent
that
though
the
shares
issued
at
a
thousand
francs
fell
to
three
hundred
they
rose
to
seven
and
will
reach
par
yet
after
weathering
the
stormy
years
and
the
financial
crisis
of
sent
them
down
after
the
revolution
of
july
they
fell
flat
but
there
really
is
something
in
the
affair
nucingen
simply
could
not
invent
a
bad
speculation
in
short
as
several
banks
of
the
highest
standing
have
been
mixed
up
in
the
affair
it
would
be
unparliamentary
to
go
further
into
detail
the
nominal
capital
amounted
to
ten
millions
the
real
capital
to
seven
three
millions
were
allotted
to
the
founders
and
bankers
that
brought
it
out
everything
was
done
with
a
view
to
sending
up
the
shares
two
hundred
francs
during
the
first
six
months
by
the
payment
of
a
sham
dividend
twenty
per
cent
on
ten
millions
du
tillet
s
interest
in
the
concern
amounted
to
five
hundred
thousand
francs
in
the
slang
of
the
day
this
share
of
the
spoils
was
a
sop
in
the
nucingen
with
his
millions
made
by
the
aid
of
a
lithographer
s
stone
and
a
handful
of
pink
paper
proposed
to
himself
to
operate
certain
nice
little
shares
carefully
hoarded
in
his
private
office
till
the
time
came
for
putting
them
on
the
market
the
shareholders
money
floated
the
concern
and
paid
for
splendid
business
premises
so
they
began
operations
and
nucingen
held
in
reserve
founders
shares
in
heaven
knows
what
coal
and
argentiferous
also
in
a
couple
of
canals
the
shares
had
been
given
to
him
for
bringing
out
the
concerns
all
four
were
in
working
order
well
got
up
and
popular
for
they
paid
good
dividends
nucingen
might
of
course
count
on
getting
the
differences
if
the
shares
went
up
but
this
formed
no
part
of
the
baron
s
schemes
he
left
the
shares
at
on
the
market
to
tempt
the
fishes
so
he
had
massed
his
securities
as
napoleon
massed
his
troops
all
with
a
view
to
suspending
payment
in
the
thick
of
the
approaching
crisis
of
which
revolutionized
european
markets
if
nucingen
had
had
his
prince
of
wagram
he
might
have
said
like
napoleon
from
the
heights
of
santon
make
a
careful
survey
of
the
situation
on
such
and
such
a
day
at
such
an
hour
funds
will
be
poured
in
at
such
a
but
in
whom
could
he
confide
du
tillet
had
no
suspicion
of
his
own
complicity
in
nucingen
s
plot
and
the
bold
baron
had
learned
from
his
previous
experiments
in
suspensions
of
payment
that
he
must
have
some
man
whom
he
could
trust
to
act
at
need
as
a
lever
upon
the
creditor
nucingen
had
never
a
nephew
he
dared
not
take
a
confidant
yet
he
must
have
a
devoted
and
intelligent
claparon
a
born
diplomatist
with
a
good
manner
a
man
worthy
of
him
and
fit
to
take
office
under
government
such
connections
are
not
made
in
a
day
nor
yet
in
a
year
by
this
time
rastignac
had
been
so
thoroughly
entangled
by
nucingen
that
being
like
the
prince
de
la
paix
equally
beloved
by
the
king
and
queen
of
spain
he
fancied
that
he
rastignac
had
secured
a
very
valuable
dupe
in
for
a
long
while
he
had
laughed
at
a
man
whose
capacities
he
was
unable
to
estimate
he
ended
in
a
sober
serious
and
devout
admiration
of
nucingen
owning
that
nucingen
really
had
the
power
which
he
thought
he
himself
alone
possessed
from
rastignac
s
introduction
to
society
in
paris
he
had
been
led
to
contemn
it
utterly
from
the
year
he
thought
like
the
baron
that
honesty
was
a
question
of
appearances
he
looked
upon
the
world
as
a
mixture
of
corruption
and
rascality
of
every
sort
if
he
admitted
exceptions
he
condemned
the
mass
he
put
no
belief
in
any
virtue
men
did
right
or
wrong
as
circumstances
decided
his
worldly
wisdom
was
the
work
of
a
moment
he
learned
his
lesson
at
the
summit
of
pere
lachaise
one
day
when
he
buried
a
poor
good
man
there
it
was
his
delphine
s
father
who
died
deserted
by
his
daughters
and
their
husbands
a
dupe
of
our
society
and
of
the
truest
affection
rastignac
then
and
there
resolved
to
exploit
this
world
to
wear
full
dress
of
virtue
honesty
and
fine
manners
he
was
empanoplied
in
selfishness
when
the
young
scion
of
nobility
discovered
that
nucingen
wore
the
same
armor
he
respected
him
much
as
some
knight
mounted
upon
a
barb
and
arrayed
in
damascened
steel
would
have
respected
an
adversary
equally
well
horsed
and
equipped
at
a
tournament
in
the
middle
ages
but
for
the
time
he
had
grown
effeminate
amid
the
delights
of
capua
the
friendship
of
such
a
woman
as
the
baronne
de
nucingen
is
of
a
kind
that
sets
a
man
abjuring
egoism
in
all
its
forms
delphine
had
been
deceived
once
already
in
her
first
venture
of
the
affections
she
came
across
a
piece
of
birmingham
manufacture
in
the
shape
of
the
late
lamented
de
marsay
and
therefore
she
could
not
but
feel
a
limitless
affection
for
a
young
provincial
s
articles
of
faith
her
tenderness
reacted
upon
rastignac
so
by
the
time
that
nucingen
had
put
his
wife
s
friend
into
the
harness
in
which
the
exploiter
always
gets
the
exploited
he
had
reached
the
precise
juncture
when
he
the
baron
meditated
a
third
suspension
of
payment
to
rastignac
he
confided
his
position
he
pointed
out
to
rastignac
a
means
of
making
as
a
consequence
of
his
intimacy
he
was
expected
to
play
the
part
of
confederate
the
baron
judged
it
unsafe
to
communicate
the
whole
of
his
plot
to
his
conjugal
collaborator
rastignac
quite
believed
in
impending
disaster
and
the
baron
allowed
him
to
believe
further
that
he
rastignac
saved
the
shop
but
when
there
are
so
many
threads
in
a
skein
there
are
apt
to
be
knots
rastignac
trembled
for
delphine
s
money
he
stipulated
that
delphine
must
be
independent
and
her
estate
separated
from
her
husband
s
swearing
to
himself
that
he
would
repay
her
by
trebling
her
fortune
as
however
rastignac
said
nothing
of
himself
nucingen
begged
him
to
take
in
the
event
of
success
shares
of
a
thousand
francs
in
the
argentiferous
and
eugene
took
them
not
to
offend
him
nucingen
had
put
rastignac
up
to
this
the
day
before
that
evening
in
the
rue
joubert
when
our
friend
counseled
malvina
to
marry
a
cold
shiver
ran
through
rastignac
at
the
sight
of
so
many
happy
folk
in
paris
going
to
and
fro
unconscious
of
the
impending
loss
even
so
a
young
commander
might
shiver
at
the
first
sight
of
an
army
drawn
up
before
a
battle
he
saw
the
d
aiglemonts
the
d
aldriggers
and
beaudenord
poor
little
isaure
and
godefroid
playing
at
love
what
were
they
but
acis
and
galatea
under
the
rock
which
a
hulking
polyphemus
was
about
to
send
down
upon
them
that
monkey
of
a
bixiou
has
something
almost
like
talent
said
blondet
oh
so
i
am
not
maundering
now
asked
bixiou
enjoying
his
success
as
he
looked
round
at
his
surprised
for
two
months
past
he
continued
godefroid
had
given
himself
up
to
all
the
little
pleasures
of
preparation
for
the
marriage
at
such
times
men
are
like
birds
building
nests
in
spring
they
come
and
go
pick
up
their
bits
of
straw
and
fly
off
with
them
in
their
beaks
to
line
the
nest
that
is
to
hold
a
brood
of
young
birds
by
and
by
isaure
s
bridegroom
had
taken
a
house
in
the
rue
de
la
plancher
at
a
thousand
crowns
a
comfortable
little
house
neither
too
large
nor
too
small
which
suited
them
every
morning
he
went
round
to
take
a
look
at
the
workmen
and
to
superintend
the
painters
he
had
introduced
comfort
the
only
good
thing
in
england
heating
apparatus
to
maintain
an
even
temperature
all
over
the
house
fresh
soft
colors
carefully
chosen
furniture
neither
too
showy
nor
too
much
in
fashion
fitted
to
every
window
inside
and
out
silver
plate
and
new
carriages
he
had
seen
to
the
stables
and
where
toby
joby
paddy
floundered
and
fidgeted
about
like
a
marmot
let
loose
apparently
rejoiced
to
know
that
there
would
be
women
about
the
place
and
a
lady
this
fervent
passion
of
a
man
that
sets
up
housekeeping
choosing
clocks
going
to
visit
his
betrothed
with
his
pockets
full
of
patterns
of
stuffs
consulting
her
as
to
the
bedroom
furniture
going
coming
and
trotting
about
for
love
s
sake
all
this
i
say
is
a
spectacle
in
the
highest
degree
calculated
to
rejoice
the
hearts
of
honest
people
especially
tradespeople
and
as
nothing
pleases
folk
better
than
the
marriage
of
a
young
fellow
of
and
a
charming
girl
of
nineteen
that
dances
admirably
well
godefroid
in
his
perplexity
over
the
corbeille
asked
mme
de
nucingen
and
rastignac
to
breakfast
with
him
and
advise
him
on
this
point
he
hit
likewise
on
the
happy
idea
of
asking
his
cousin
d
aiglemont
and
his
wife
to
meet
them
as
well
as
mme
de
serizy
women
of
the
world
are
ready
enough
to
join
for
once
in
an
improvised
at
a
bachelor

way
of
playing

in

went
over

these
little
expeditions
as

they
feel
young
again
with
the
young
bliss
unspoiled
as
yet
by
fruition
breakfast
was
served
in
godefroid
s
decked
out
like
a
troop
horse
for
a
farewell
to
bachelor
life
there
were
dainty
little
dishes
such
as
women
love
to
devour
nibble
at
and
sip
of
a
morning
when
they
are
usually
alarmingly
hungry
and
horribly
afraid
to
confess
to
it
it
would
seem
that
a
woman
compromises
herself
by
admitting
that
she
is
why
have
you
come
alone
inquired
godefroid
when
rastignac
mme
de
nucingen
is
out
of
spirits
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
answered
rastignac
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
temper
has
been
a
quarrel
hazarded
at
four
o
clock
the
women
took
flight
for
the
bois
de
boulogne
rastignac
stayed
in
the
room
and
looked
out
of
the
window
fixing
his
melancholy
gaze
upon
toby
joby
paddy
who
stood
his
arms
crossed
in
napoleonic
fashion
audaciously
posted
in
front
of
beaudenord
s
cab
horse
the
child
could
only
control
the
animal
with
his
shrill
little
voice
but
the
horse
was
afraid
of
joby
toby
well
began
godefroid
what
is
the
matter
with
you
my
dear
fellow
you
look
gloomy
and
anxious
your
gaiety
is
forced
you
are
tormented
by
incomplete
happiness
it
is
wretched
and
that
is
a
fact
when
one
can
not
marry
the
woman
one
loves
at
the
mayor
s
office
and
the
have
you
courage
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say
i
wonder
whether
you
will
see
how
much
a
man
must
be
attached
to
a
friend
if
he
can
be
guilty
of
such
a
breach
of
confidence
as
this
for
his
something
in
rastignac
s
voice
stung
like
a
lash
of
a
whip
asked
godefroid
de
beaudenord
turning
pale
i
was
unhappy
over
your
joy
i
had
not
the
heart
to
keep
such
a
secret
to
myself
when
i
saw
all
these
preparations
your
happiness
in
just
say
it
out
in
three
words
swear
to
me
on
your
honor
that
you
will
be
as
silent
as
the
grave
as
the
grave
repeated
beaudenord
that
if
one
of
your
relatives
were
concerned
in
this
secret
he
should
not
know
very
well
nucingen
started
for
brussels
he
must
file
his
schedule
if
he
can
not
arrange
a
settlement
this
very
morning
delphine
petitioned
for
the
separation
of
her
estate
you
may
still
save
your
how
faltered
godefroid
the
blood
turned
to
ice
in
his
veins
simply
write
to
the
baron
de
nucingen
antedating
your
letter
a
fortnight
and
instruct
him
to
invest
all
your
capital
in
rastignac
suggested
claparon
and
company
and
continued
you
have
a
fortnight
a
month
possibly
three
months
in
which
to
realize
and
make
something
the
shares
are
still
going
up
but
d
aiglemont
who
was
here
at
breakfast
with
us
has
a
million
in
nucingen
s
look
here
i
do
not
know
whether
there
will
be
enough
of
these
shares
to
cover
it
and
besides
i
am
not
his
friend
i
can
not
betray
nucingen
s
confidence
you
must
not
speak
to
d
aiglemont
if
you
say
a
word
you
must
answer
to
me
for
the
godefroid
stood
stock
still
for
ten
minutes
do
you
accept
yes
or
no
said
the
inexorable
rastignac
godefroid
took
up
the
pen
wrote
at
rastignac
s
dictation
and
signed
his
name
my
poor
cousin
he
cried
each
for
himself
said
rastignac
and
there
is
one
more
settled
he
added
to
himself
as
he
left
beaudenord
while
rastignac
was
manoeuvring
thus
in
paris
imagine
the
state
of
things
on
the
bourse
a
friend
of
mine
a
provincial
a
stupid
creature
once
asked
me
as
we
came
past
the
bourse
between
four
and
five
in
the
afternoon
what
all
that
crowd
of
chatterers
was
doing
what
they
could
possibly
find
to
say
to
each
other
and
why
they
were
wandering
to
and
fro
when
business
in
public
securities
was
over
for
the
day
my
friend
said
i
they
have
made
their
meal
and
now
they
are
digesting
it
while
they
digest
it
they
gossip
about
their
neighbors
or
there
would
be
no
commercial
security
in
paris
concerns
are
floated
here
such
and
such
a
man
palma
for
instance
who
is
something
the
same
here
as
sinard
at
the
academie
royale
des
sciences
palma
says
let
the
speculation
be
made
and
the
speculation
is
what
a
man
that
hebrew
is
put
in
blondet
he
has
not
had
a
university
education
but
a
universal
education
and
universal
does
not
in
his
case
mean
superficial
whatever
he
knows
he
knows
to
the
bottom
he
has
a
genius
an
intuitive
faculty
for
business
he
is
the
oracle
of
all
the
lynxes
that
rule
the
paris
market
they
will
not
touch
an
investment
until
palma
has
looked
into
it
he
looks
solemn
he
listens
ponders
and
reflects
his
interlocutor
thinks
that
after
this
consideration
he
has
come
round
his
man
till
palma
says
this
will
not
do
for
the
most
extraordinary
thing
about
palma
to
my
mind
is
the
fact
that
he
and
werbrust
were
partners
for
ten
years
and
there
was
never
the
shadow
of
a
disagreement
between
that
is
the
way
with
the
very
strong
or
the
very
weak
any
two
between
the
extremes
fall
out
and
lose
no
time
in
making
enemies
of
each
other
said
couture
nucingen
you
see
had
neatly
and
skilfully
put
a
little
bombshell
under
the
colonnades
of
the
bourse
and
towards
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
it
here
is
something
serious
have
you
heard
the
news
asked
du
tillet
drawing
werbrust
into
a
corner
here
is
nucingen
gone
off
to
brussels
and
his
wife
petitioning
for
a
separation
of
her
are
you
and
he
in
it
together
for
a
liquidation
asked
werbrust
smiling
no
foolery
werbrust
said
du
tillet
you
know
the
holders
of
his
paper
now
look
here
there
is
business
in
it
shares
in
this
new
concern
of
ours
have
gone
up
twenty
per
cent
already
they
will
go
up
to
by
the
end
of
the
quarter
you
know
why
they
are
going
to
pay
a
splendid
sly
dog
said
werbrust
get
along
with
you
you
are
a
devil
with
long
and
sharp
claws
and
you
have
them
deep
in
the
just
let
me
speak
or
we
shall
not
have
time
to
operate
i
hit
on
the
idea
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
news
i
positively
saw
mme
de
nucingen
crying
she
is
afraid
for
her
poor
little
thing
said
the
old
alsacien
jew
with
an
ironical
expression
well
he
added
as
du
tillet
was
silent
well
at
my
place
i
have
a
thousand
shares
of
a
thousand
francs
in
our
concern
nucingen
handed
them
over
to
me
to
put
on
the
market
do
you
understand
good
now
let
us
buy
up
a
million
of
nucingen
s
paper
at
a
discount
of
ten
or
twenty
per
cent

of

creditors
both
confusion
will
be

we
must
set
about
it
carefully
or
the
holders
may
imagine
that
we
are
operating
in

then
werbrust
understood
he
squeezed
du
tillet
s
hand
with
an
expression
such
as
a
woman

face
wears
when
she
is
playing
her
neighbor
a
trick
martin
falleix
came
well
have
you
heard

asked

into
mexican

and
they
are
sending
him
metal
in

old
spanish
cannon
cast
in
such
an
insane
fashion
that
they
melted
down
gold
and
and

for
it
and
all
the
wreck
of
the
spanish
dominion
in
the
indies
the
specie
is
slow
in
coming
and
the
dear
baron
is
hard
up
that
is
it
is
a
fact
said
werbrust
i
am
taking
his
paper
myself
at
twenty
per
cent
the
news
spread
swift
as
fire
in
a
straw
rick
the
most
contradictory
reports
got
about
but
such
confidence
was
felt
in
the
firm
after
the
two
previous
suspensions
that
every
one
stuck
to
nucingen
s
paper
palma
must
lend
us
a
hand
said
werbrust
now
palma
was
the
keller
s
oracle
and
the
kellers
were
brimful
of
nucingen
s
paper
a
hint
from
palma
would
be
enough
werbrust
arranged
with
palma
and
he
rang
the
alarm
bell
there
was
a
panic
next
day
on
the
bourse
the
kellers
acting
on
palma
s
advice
let
go
nucingen
s
paper
at
ten
per
cent
of
loss
they
set
the
example
on
change
for
they
were
supposed
to
know
very
well
what
they
were
about
taillefer
followed
up
with
three
hundred
thousand
francs
at
a
discount
of
twenty
per
cent
and
martin
falleix
with
two
hundred
thousand
at
fifteen
gigonnet
saw
what
was
going
on
he
helped
to
spread
the
panic
with
a
view
to
buying
up
nucingen
s
paper
himself
and
making
a
commission
of
two
or
three
per
cent
out
of
werbrust
in
a
corner
of
the
bourse
he
came
upon
poor
matifat
who
had
three
hundred
thousand
francs
in
nucingen
s
bank
matifat
ghastly
and
haggard
beheld
the
terrible
gigonnet
the
of
his
old
quarter
coming
up
to
worry
him
he
shuddered
in
spite
of
himself
things
are
looking
bad
there
is
a
crisis
on
hand
nucingen
is
compounding
with
his
creditors
but
this
does
not
interest
you
daddy
matifat
you
are
out
of
oh
well
you
are
mistaken
gigonnet
i
am
in
for
three
hundred
thousand
francs
i
meant
to
speculate
in
spanish
then
you
have
saved
your
money
spanish
bonds
would
have
swept
everything
away
whereas
i
am
prepared
to
offer
you
something
like
fifty
per
cent
for
your
account
with
you
are
very
keen
about
it
it
seems
to
me
said
matifat
i
never
knew
a
banker
yet
that
paid
less
than
fifty
per
cent
ah
if
it
were
only
a
matter
of
ten
per
cent
of
loss
added
the
retired
man
of
drugs
well
will
you
take
fifteen
asked
gigonnet
you
are
very
keen
about
it
it
seems
to
me
said
matifat
will
you
take
twelve
done
said
gigonnet
before
night
two
millions
had
been
bought
up
in
the
names
of
the
three
confederates
and
posted
by
du
tillet
to
the
debit
side
of
nucingen
s
account
next
day
they
drew
their
premium
the
dainty
little
old
baroness
d
aldrigger
was
at
breakfast
with
her
two
daughters
and
godefroid
when
rastignac
came
in
with
a
diplomatic
air
to
steer
the
conversation
on
the
financial
crisis
the
baron
de
nucingen
felt
a
lively
regard
for
the
d
aldrigger
family
he
was
prepared
if
things
went
amiss
to
cover
the
baroness
account
with
his
best
securities
to
wit
some
shares
in
the
argentiferous
but
the
application
must
come
from
the
lady
poor
nucingen
said
the
baroness
what
can
have
become
of
him
he
is
in
belgium
his
wife
is
petitioning
for
a
separation
of
her
property
but
he
had
gone
to
see
if
he
can
arrange
with
some
bankers
to
see
him
dear
me
that
reminds
me
of
my
poor
husband
dear
de
rastignac
how
you
must
feel
this
so
attached
as
you
are
to
the
house
if
all
the
indifferent
are
covered
his
personal
friends
will
be
rewarded
later
on
he
will
pull
through
he
is
a
clever
an
honest
man
above
all
things
said
the
baroness
a
month
later
nucingen
met
all
his
liabilities
with
no
formalities
beyond
the
letters
by
which
creditors
signified
the
investments
which
they
preferred
to
take
in
exchange
for
their
capital
and
with
no
action
on
the
part
of
other
banks
beyond
registering
the
transfer
of
nucingen
s
paper
for
the
investments
in
favor
while
du
tillet
werbrust
claparon
gigonnet
and
others
that
thought
themselves
clever
were
fetching
in
nucingen
s
paper
from
abroad
with
a
premium
of
one
per
cent
for
it
was
still
worth
their
while
to
exchange
it
for
securities
in
a
rising
market
there
was
all
the
more
talk
on
the
bourse
because
there
was
nothing
now
to
fear
they
babbled
over
nucingen
he
was
discussed
and
judged
they
even
slandered
him
his
luxurious
life
his
enterprises
when
a
man
has
so
much
on
his
hands
he
overreaches
himself
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
the
talk
was
at
its
height
when
several
people
were
greatly
astonished
to
receive
letters
from
geneva
basel
milan
naples
genoa
marseilles
and
london
in
which
their
correspondents
previously
advised
of
the
failure
informed
them
that
somebody
was
offering
one
per
cent
for
nucingen
s
paper
there
is
something
up
said
the
lynxes
of
the
bourse
the
court
meanwhile
had
granted
the
application
for
mme
de
nucingen
s
separation
as
to
her
estate
and
the
question
became
still
more
complicated
the
newspapers
announced
the
return
of
le
baron
de
nucingen
from
a
journey
to
belgium
he
had
been
arranging
it
was
said
with
a
belgian
firm
to
resume
the
working
of
some
in
the
bois
de
bossut
the
baron
himself
appeared
on
the
bourse
and
never
even
took
the
trouble
to
contradict
the
slanders
circulating
against
him
he
scorned
to
reply
through
the
press
he
simply
bought
a
splendid
estate
just
outside
paris
for
two
millions
of
francs
six
weeks
afterwards
the
bordeaux
shipping
intelligence
announced
that
two
vessels
with
cargoes
of
bullion
to
the
amount
of
seven
millions
consigned
to
the
firm
of
nucingen
were
lying
in
the
river
then
it
was
plain
to
palma
werbrust
and
du
tillet
that
the
trick
had
been
played
nobody
else
was
any
the
wiser
the
three
scholars
studied
the
means
by
which
the
great
bubble
had
been
created
saw
that
it
had
been
preparing
for
eleven
months
and
pronounced
nucingen
the
greatest
financier
in
europe
rastignac
understood
nothing
of
all
this
but
he
had
the
four
hundred
thousand
francs
which
nucingen
had
allowed
him
to
shear
from
the
parisian
sheep
and
he
portioned
his
sisters
d
aiglemont
at
a
hint
from
his
cousin
beaudenord
besought
rastignac
to
accept
ten
per
cent
upon
his
million
if
he
would
undertake
to
convert
it
into
shares
in
a
canal
which
is
still
to
make
for
nucingen
worked
things
with
the
government
to
such
purpose
that
the
concessionaires
find
it
to
their
interest
not
to
finish
their
scheme
charles
grandet
implored
delphine
s
lover
to
use
his
interest
to
secure
shares
for
him
in
exchange
for
his
cash
and
altogether
rastignac
played
the
part
of
law
for
ten
days
he
had
the
prettiest
duchesses
in
france
praying
to
him
to
allot
shares
to
them
and
the
young
man
very
likely
has
an
income
of
forty
thousand
livres
derived
in
the
first
instance
from
the
argentiferous
if
every
one
was
better
off
who
can
have
lost
asked
finot
hear
the
conclusion
rejoined
bixiou
the
marquis
d
aiglemont
and
beaudenord
i
put
them
forward
as
two
examples
out
of
many
kept
their
allotted
shares
enticed
by
the
dividend
that
fell
due
a
few
months
afterwards
they
had
another
three
per
cent
on
their
capital
they
sang
nucingen
s
praises
and
took
his
part
at
a
time
when
everybody
suspected
that
he
was
going
bankrupt
godefroid
married
his
beloved
isaure
and
took
shares
in
the
mines
to
the
value
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
the
nucingens
gave
a
ball
even
more
splendid
than
people
expected
of
them
on
the
occasion
of
the
wedding
delphine
s
present
to
the
bride
was
a
charming
set
of
rubies
isaure
danced
a
happy
wife
a
girl
no
longer
the
little
baroness
was
more
than
ever
a
shepherdess
of
the
alps
the
ball
was
at
its
height
when
malvina
the
of
musset
s
poem
heard
du
tillet
s
voice
drily
advising
her
to
take
desroches
desroches
warmed
to
the
right
degree
by
rastignac
and
nucingen
tried
to
come
to
an
understanding
financially
but
at
the
first
hint
of
shares
in
the
mines
for
the
bride
s
portion
he
broke
off
and
went
back
to
the
matifat
s
in
the
rue
du
only
to
find
the
accursed
canal
shares
which
gigonnet
had
foisted
on
matifat
in
lieu
of
cash
they
had
not
long
to
wait
for
the
crash
the
firm
of
claparon
did
business
on
too
large
a
scale
the
capital
was
locked
up
the
concern
ceased
to
serve
its
purposes
or
to
pay
dividends
though
the
speculations
were
sound
these
misfortunes
coincided
with
the
events
of
in
it
was
too
well
known
that
claparon
was
a
man
of
straw
set
up
by
the
two
giants
he
fell
from
his
pedestal
shares
that
had
fetched
twelve
hundred
and
fifty
francs
fell
to
four
hundred
though
intrinsically
they
were
worth
six
nucingen
knowing
their
value
bought
them
up
at
four
meanwhile
the
little
baroness
d
aldrigger
had
sold
out
of
the
mines
that
paid
no
dividends
and
godefroid
had
reinvested
the
money
belonging
to
his
wife
and
her
mother
in
claparon
s
concern
debts
compelled
them
to
realize
when
the
shares
were
at
their
lowest
so
that
of
seven
hundred
thousand
francs
only
two
hundred
thousand
remained
they
made
a
clearance
and
all
that
was
left
was
prudently
invested
in
the
three
per
cents
at
godefroid
the
sometime
gay
and
careless
bachelor
who
had
lived
without
taking
thought
all
his
life
long
found
himself
saddled
with
a
little
goose
of
a
wife
totally
unfitted
to
bear
adversity
indeed
before
six
months
were
over
he
had
witnessed
the
anserine
transformation
of
his
beloved
to
say
nothing
of
a
whose
mind
ran
on
pretty
dresses
while
she
had
not
bread
to
eat
the
two
families
must
live
together
to
live
at
all
it
was
only
by
stirring
up
all
his
considerably
chilled
interest
that
godefroid
got
a
post
in
the
audit
department
his
friends
they
were
out
of
town
his
relatives
all
astonishment
and
promises
what
my
dear
boy
oh
count
upon
me
poor
fellow
and
beaudenord
was
clean
forgotten
fifteen
minutes
afterwards
he
owed
his
place
to
nucingen
and
de
vandenesse
and
these
so
estimable
and
unfortunate
people
are
living
on
a
third
floor
not
counting
the
entresol
in
the
rue
du
mont
thabor
malvina
the
adolphus
pearl
of
a
granddaughter
has
not
a
farthing
she
gives
not
to
be
a
burden
upon
her
you
may
see
a
tall
dark
thin
withered
woman
like
a
mummy
escaped
from
passalacqua
s
about
afoot
through
the
streets
of
paris
in
beaudenord
lost
his
situation
just
as
his
wife
presented
him
with
a
fourth
child
a
family
of
eight
and
two
servants
wirth
and
his
wife
and
an
income
of
eight
thousand
livres
and
at
this
moment
the
mines
are
paying
so
well
that
an
original
share
of
a
thousand
francs
brings
in
a
dividend
of
cent
per
cent
rastignac
and
mme
de
nucingen
bought
the
shares
sold
by
the
baroness
and
godefroid
the
revolution
made
a
peer
of
france
of
nucingen
and
a
grand
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
he
has
not
stopped
payment
since
but
still
i
hear
that
he
has
something
like
seventeen
millions
he
put
faith
in
the
ordinances
of
july
sold
out
of
all
his
investments
and
boldly
put
his
money
into
the
funds
when
the
three
per
cents
stood
at
he
persuaded
the
tuileries
that
this
was
done
out
of
devotion
and
about
the
same
time
he
and
du
tillet
between
them
swallowed
down
three
millions
belonging
to
that
great
scamp
philippe
bridau
quite
lately
our
baron
was
walking
along
the
rue
de
rivoli
on
his
way
to
the
bois
when
he
met
the
baroness
d
aldrigger
under
the
colonnade
the
little
old
lady
wore
a
tiny
green
bonnet
with
a
lining
a
flowered
gown
and
a
mantilla
altogether
she
was
more
than
ever
the
shepherdess
of
the
alps
she
could
no
more
be
made
to
understand
the
causes
of
her
poverty
than
the
sources
of
her
wealth
as
she
went
along
leaning
upon
poor
malvina
that
model
of
heroic
devotion
she
seemed
to
be
the
young
girl
and
malvina
the
old
mother
wirth
followed
them
carrying
an
umbrella
dere
are
beoples
whose
vordune
i
vound
it
imbossible
to
make
said
the
baron
addressing
his
companion
cointet
a
cabinet
minister
now
dot
de
baroxysm
off
brincibles
haf
bassed
off
chust
reinshtate
dot
boor
so
beaudenord
went
back
to
his
desk
thanks
to
nucingen
s
good
offices
and
the
d
aldriggers
extol
nucingen
as
a
hero
of
friendship
for
he
always
sends
the
little
shepherdess
of
the
alps
and
her
daughters
invitations
to
his
balls
no
creature
whatsoever
can
be
made
to
understand
that
the
baron
yonder
three
times
did
his
best
to
plunder
the
public
without
breaking
the
letter
of
the
law
and
enriched
people
in
spite
of
himself
no
one
has
a
word
to
say
against
him
if
anybody
should
suggest
that
a
big
capitalist
often
is
another
word
for
a
it
would
be
a
most
egregious
calumny
if
stocks
rise
and
fall
if
property
improves
and
depreciates
the
fluctuations
of
the
market
are
caused
by
a
common
movement
a
something
in
the
air
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
subject
like
other
tides
to
lunar
influences
the
great
arago
is
much
to
blame
for
giving
us
no
scientific
theory
to
account
for
this
important
phenomenon
the
only
outcome
of
all
this
is
an
axiom
which
i
have
never
seen
anywhere
in
print
and
that
is
the
debtor
is
more
than
a
match
for
the
oh
said
blondet
for
my
own
part
all
that
we
have
been
saying
seems
to
me
to
be
a
paraphrase
of
the
epigram
in
which
montesquieu
summed
up
esprit
des
what
said
finot
laws
are
like
spiders
webs
the
big
flies
get
through
while
the
little
ones
are
then
what
are
you
for
asked
finot
for
absolute
government
the
only
kind
of
government
under
which
enterprises
against
the
spirit
of
the
law
can
be
put
down
yes
arbitrary
rule
is
the
salvation
of
a
country
when
it
comes
to
the
support
of
justice
for
the
right
of
mercy
is
strictly
the
king
can
pardon
a
fraudulent
bankrupt
he
can
not
do
anything
for
the
victims
the
letter
of
the
law
is
fatal
to
modern
just
get
that
into
the
electors
heads
said
bixiou
some
one
has
undertaken
to
do
who
time
as
the
bishop
of
leon
said
liberty
is
ancient
but
kingship
is
eternal
any
nation
in
its
right
mind
returns
to
monarchical
government
in
one
form
or
