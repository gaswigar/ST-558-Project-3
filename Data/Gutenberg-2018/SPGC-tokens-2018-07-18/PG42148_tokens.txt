you

if
you

so
by
luigi
pirandello
awarded
nobel
prize
in
literature
new
york
dutton
publishers
prefatory
note
no
apology
is
necessary
for
offering
to
american
readers
a
play
which
critics
with
singular
unanimity
have
called
one
of
the
most
original
productions
seen
on
the
modern
stage
in
less
than
a
year
time
six
characters
in
search
of
an
author
has
won
a
distinguished
place
in
the
dramatic
literature
of
the
western
world
attracting
audiences
and
engaging
intellects
far
removed
from
the
particular
influences
which
made
of
it
a
season
sensation
in
italy
yet
the
word
original
is
not
enough
unless
we
embrace
under
that
characterization
qualities
far
richer
than
those
normally
credited
to
the
trick
play
the
six
characters
is
something
more
than
an
unusually
ingenious
variation
of
the
play
within
a
play
it
is
something
more
than
a
new
twist
given
to
the
dream
character
made
familiar
by
the
contemporary
italian
grotesques
it
is
a
dramatization
of
the
artistic
process
itself
in
relation
to
the
problem
of
reality
and
unreality
which
has
engaged
pirandello
in
one
way
or
another
for
more
than
twenty
years
i
venture
to
insist
upon
this
point
as
against
those
observers
who
have
tried
to
see
in
the
six
characters
an
ironical
satire
of
the
commercial
drama
as
we
know
it
today
mixed
more
or
less
artificially
with
a
rather
obvious
philosophy
of
no
such
mixture
exists
the
blend
is
organic
the
object
of
pirandello
bitter
irony
is
not
the
nor
the
theatrical
producer
nor
even
the
dramatic
critic
it
is
the
dramatist
it
is
the
artist
it
is
in
the
end
life
itself
i
suppose
the
human
soul
presents
no
mysteries
to
those
who
have
been
thoroughly
grounded
in
the
science
of
freud
but
in
spite
of
a
few
hamlets
still
survive
pirandello
is
one
of
them
what
are
people
really
like
in
the
business
of
everyday
life
nothing
is
commoner
than
the
categorical
judgment
sweeping
and
assured
in
its
affirmatives
but
as
we
cut
a
little
deeply
into
the
living
matter
of
the
spirit
the
problem
becomes
more
complicated
do
we
ever
understand
the
whole
motivation
of
an
action
not
in
others
only
but
even
in
ourselves
oh
yes
there
are
people
who
the
state
knows
with
its
laws
and
its
procedures
and
society
knows
with
its
conventions
and
individuals
know
with
their
formulas
for
conduct
often
cannily
applied
with
reference
to
the
ironical
element
as
everyone
has
noted
is
fundamental
in
pirandello
apart
from
works
in
his
earlier
manner
realistic
pictures
from
southern
italian
life
including
such
gems
as
sicilian
limes
most
distinctive
productions
have
dealt
with
this
general
theme
no
one
of
them
indeed
exhausts
it
and
how
could
this
be
otherwise
pirandello
approaching
the
sixties
to
be
sure
is
nevertheless
in
spirit
a
man
of
the
younger
italian
generation
which
trained
by
croce
and
gentile
has
learned
how
to
think
but
however
great
his
delight
in
playing
with
actual
idealism
he
knows
the
difference
between
a
drama
and
a
philosophical
dissertation
his
plays
are
situations
embodying
conclusions
simple
or
indeed
obvious
in
their
convincingness
they
must
be
taken
as
a
whole
if
one
would
look
for
a
full
statement
of
pirandello
thought
a
thought
moreover
which
may
or
may
not
invite
us
to
profound
reflection
enough
for
the
lover
of
the
theatre
is
the
fact
that
pirandello
derives
the
most
interesting
dramatic
possibilities
from
it
sometimes
it
is
the
reality
which
society
sees
brought
into
contrast
with
the
reality
which
action
proves
piacere
again
it
is
the
reality
which
a
man
sees
in
himself
thwarted
by
the
reality
which
actually
controls
ma
non
è
una
cosa
seria
in
right
you
are
è
se
vi
we
have
a
general
satire
of
the
cocksure
who
placed
in
the
presence
of
reality
and
unreality
are
unable
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other
in
the
six
characters
it
is
the
turn
of
the
artist
can
art
creative
art
where
the
spirit
would
seem
most
autonomous
itself
determine
reality
no
because
once
a
character
is
born
he
acquires
such
an
independence
even
of
his
own
author
that
he
can
be
imagined
by
everybody
in
situations
where
the
author
never
dreamed
of
placing
him
and
so
acquires
a
meaning
which
the
author
never
thought
of
giving
him
in
this
lies
the
great
originality
of
this
very
original
play
the
discovery
so
italian
when
one
thinks
of
it
and
so
novel
as
one
compares
it
with
the
traditional
rôle
of
the
artist
in
the
european
play
that
the
laborious
effort
of
artistic
creation
is
itself
a
dramatic
theme
so
unruly
so
assertive
is
this
thing
called
life
ever
rising
to
harass
and
defeat
anyone
who
would
interpret
crystallize
devitalize
it
and
beyond
the
drama
lies
the
poetry
a
poetry
of
mysterious
symbolism
made
up
of
terror
and
rebellion
and
pity
and
human
kindliness
let
us
not
miss
the
latter
especially
in
the
complex
mood
of
all
theatre
the
three
plays
of
pirandello
here
offered
in
translations
that
do
not
hope
to
be
adequate
are
famous
specimens
of
the
new
theatre
in
italy
the
term
new
is
much
contested
not
only
in
italy
but
abroad
in
using
the
word
here
it
is
not
necessary
to
claim
that
this
young
impulsive
fascinatingly
boisterous
italy
is
doing
things
that
no
one
else
ever
thought
of
doing
we
remain
on
safe
ground
if
we
assert
that
pirandello
and
his
associates
have
broken
the
bounds
set
to
the
old
fashioned
sentimental
latin
play
the
motivations
of
the
old
theatre
were
largely
ethical
in
character
developing
spiritual
crises
from
the
conflict
of
impulses
with
a
rigid
framework
of
law
and
convention
dramatic
art
was
so
to
speak
a
department
of
geometry
dealing
with
this
or
that
projection
or
modification
of
the
triangle
husbands
tearing
their
hair
as
wives
proved
unfaithful
disappointed
lovers
pining
in
eternal
fidelity
to
mates
beyond
their
social
sphere
cuckolds
heroically
sheathing
the
stiletto
in
deference
to
a
higher
law
of
respectability
widows
sending
aspirants
to
suicide
that
the
sacrament
of
marriage
might
remain
inviolate
such
were
the
themes
and
there
is
no
doubt
besides
that
this
old
theatre
produced
works
of
great
beauty
and
intenseness
since
the
will
in
conflict
with
impulse
and
triumphing
over
impulse
always
presents
a
subject
entrancing
in
human
interest
and
noble
in
moral
implications
but
the
potentialities
of
drama
are
more
numerous
than
the
permutations
of
three
the
new
theatre
in
italy
is
new
in
this
discovery
at
least
an
equally
strong
and
original
variation
of
the
insanity
motive
is
the
first
of
two
plays
by
pirandello
dealing
with
a
special
aspect
of
the
problem
of
reality
and
unreality
the
second
not
yet
given
to
the
public
is
gli
and
ye
clothed
me
in
the
former
pirandello
studies
a
situation
where
an
individual
finds
a
world
of
unreality
thrust
upon
him
voluntarily
reassuming
it
later
on
when
tragedy
springs
from
the
deeper
reality
in
and
ye
clothed
me
we
have
a
girl
who
to
fill
an
empty
life
of
no
importance
creates
a
fiction
for
herself
only
to
find
it
torn
violently
from
her
and
to
be
left
in
a
naked
reality
that
is
after
all
so
unreal
these
two
plays
indicate
the
present
tendency
of
pirandello
rapid
production
a
tendency
that
promises
even
richer
results
as
this
interesting
author
delves
more
extensively
into
the
mysteries
of
individual
psychology
meanwhile
is
before
us
it
can
speak
for
itself
all
of
pirandello
plays
are
built
for
acting
and
only
incidentally
for
reading
we
make
this
observation
with
right
you
are
especially
in
mind
since
that
play
above
all
is
a
test
for
the
actor
it
is
typical
of
pirandello
for
its
rapidity
its
harshness
and
its
violence
the
skill
with
which
the
tense
tableau
is
drawn
out
of
pure
dialectic
pure
conversation
moreover
it
states
a
fundamental
preoccupation
of
pirandello
in
peculiarly
lucid
and
striking
fashion
perhaps
a
better
rendering
of
the
title
è
se
vi
pare
will
occur
to
many
ludwig
lewisohn
happily
i
thought
suggested
as
you
like
it
no
less
a
possibility
quite
in
the
spirit
of
pirandello
title
in
general
would
have
been
another
shakespearean
reminiscence
and
thinking
makes
it
so
we
have
kept
something
approximating
the
literal
which
would
be
so
it
is
if
you
think
so
the
text
of
the
six
characters
is
that
of
the
translation
designated
by
the
author
and
which
was
used
in
the
sensational
productions
of
the
play
given

yes
yes

taking
off
his
braided
cap
during
this
manoeuvre
the
six
characters
enter

stop
by

of

so
that
when
the
is
about
to
announce
their
coming
to
the
manager
they
are
already
on

tenuous
light
surrounds
them
almost
as
if
irradiated
by
them
the
faint
breath
of
their
fantastic
light
will
disappear
when
they
come
forward
towards
the
actors
they
preserve
however
something
of
the
dream
lightness
in
which
they
seem
almost
suspended
but
this
does
not
detract
from
the
essential
reality
of
their
forms
and

is
known

fresh

empty
and

with
an
especially
wide
forehead
he

very
clear

piercing

mellifluous

terrified

by
an
intolerable
weight

shame
and
abasement

in
modest
black
and
wears
a
thick
widow
veil
of

reveals
a
face
she
always
keeps
her

the
dashing
almost
impudent
beautiful
she
wears
mourning
too
but
with
great
elegance
she
shows
contempt
for
the

sir
the
we
may
be
your
fortune
the
manager
will
you
oblige
me
by
going
away
we
time
to
waste
with
mad
people
the
father
oh
sir
you
know
well
that
life
is
full
of
infinite
absurdities
which
strangely
enough
do
not
even
need
to
appear
plausible
since
they
are
true
the
manager
what
the
devil
is
he
talking
about
the
father
i
say
that
to
reverse
the
ordinary
process
may
well
be
considered
a
madness
that
is
to
create
credible
situations
in
order
that
they
may
appear
true
but
permit
me
to
observe
that
if
this
be
madness
it
is
the
sole
of
your
profession
gentlemen
actors
look
hurt
and
the
manager
up
and
looking
at
so
our
profession
seems
to
you
one
worthy
of
madmen
then
the
father
well
to
make
seem
true
that
which
is
true
without
any
need
for
a
joke
as
it
were
that
your
mission
gentlemen
to
give
life
to
fantastic
characters
on
the
stage
the
manager
the
rising
anger
of
the
but
i
would
beg
you
to
believe
my
dear
sir
that
the
profession
of
the
comedian
is
a
noble
one
if
today
as
things
go
the
playwrights
give
us
stupid
comedies
to
play
and
puppets
to
represent
instead
of
men
remember
we
are
proud
to
have
given
life
to
immortal
works
here
on
these
very
boards
actors
satisfied
applaud
their
the
father
exactly
perfectly
to
living
beings
more
alive
than
those
who
breathe
and
wear
clothes
beings
less
real
perhaps
but
truer
i
agree
with
you
entirely
actors
look
at
one
another
in
the
manager
but
what
do
you
mean
before
you
said
the
father
no
excuse
me
i
meant
it
for
you
sir
who
were
crying
out
that
you
had
no
time
to
lose
with
madmen
while
no
one
better
than
yourself
knows
that
nature
uses
the
instrument
of
human
fantasy
in
order
to
pursue
her
high
creative
purpose
the
manager
very
well
but
where
does
all
this
take
us
the
father
nowhere
it
is
merely
to
show
you
that
one
is
born
to
life
in
many
forms
in
many
shapes
as
tree
or
as
stone
as
water
as
butterfly
or
as
woman
so
one
may
also
be
born
a
character
in
a
play
the
manager
feigned
comic
so
you
and
these
other
friends
of
yours
have
been
born
characters
the
father
exactly
and
alive
as
you
see
and
actors
burst
out
the
father
i
am
sorry
you
laugh
because
we
carry
in
us
a
drama
as
you
can
guess
from
this
woman
here
veiled
in
black
the
manager
patience
at
last
and
almost
oh
chuck
it
get
away
please
clear
out
of
here
property
for
heaven
sake
turn
them
out
the
father
no
no
look
here
we
the
manager
we
come
here
to
work
you
know
leading
actor
one
can
not
let
oneself
be
made
such
a
fool
of
the
father
coming
i
marvel
at
your
incredulity
gentlemen
are
you
not
accustomed
to
see
the
characters
created
by
an
author
spring
to
life
in
yourselves
and
face
each
other
just
because
there
is
no
book
to
the
prompter
which
contains
us
you
refuse
to
believe
the
towards
manager
smiling
and
believe
me
we
are
really
six
most
interesting
characters
sir
however
the
father
yes
that
is
the
word
manager
all
at
in
the
sense
that
is
that
the
author
who
created
us
alive
no
longer
wished
or
was
no
longer
able
materially
to
put
us
into
a
work
of
art
and
this
was
a
real
crime
sir
because
he
who
has
had
the
luck
to
be
born
a
character
can
laugh
even
at
death
he
can
not
die
the
man
the
writer
the
instrument
of
the
creation
will
die
but
his
creation
does
not
die
and
to
live
for
ever
it
does
not
need
to
have
extraordinary
gifts
or
to
be
able
to
work
wonders
who
was
sancho
panza
who
was
don
abbondio
yet
they
live
eternally
because
live
germs
as
they
were
they
had
the
fortune
to
find
a
fecundating
matrix
a
fantasy
which
could
raise
and
nourish
them
make
them
live
for
ever
the
manager
that
is
quite
all
right
but
what
do
you
want
here
all
of
you
the
father
we
want
to
live
the
manager
for
eternity
the
father
no
sir
only
for
a
moment
in
you
an
actor
just
listen
to
him
leading
lady
they
want
to
live
in
us
juvenile
lead
to
the
i
no
objection
as
far
as
that
one
is
concerned
the
father
look
here
look
here
the
comedy
has
to
be
made
the
but
if
you
and
your
actors
are
willing
we
can
soon
concert
it
among
ourselves
the
manager
but
what
do
you
want
to
concert
we
do
go
in
for
concerts
here

we
play
dramas
and
comedies
the
father
exactly
that
is
just
why
we
have
come
to
you
the
manager
and
where
is
the
book
the
father
it
is
in
us
actors
the
drama
is
in
us
and
we
are
the
drama
we
are
impatient
to
play
it
our
inner
passion
drives
us
on
to
this
the
alluring
treacherous
full
of
my
passion
sir
ah
if
you
only
knew
my
passion
for
him
to
the
father
and
makes
a
pretence
of
embracing
him
then
she
breaks
out
into
a
loud
the
father
behave
yourself
and
please
laugh
in
that
fashion
the
with
your
permission

father

a
horrible
i

for
that
fool

indifferent
how
frigid
he
is
because
he
is
the
legitimate
son
he
despises

to
the
despises
this
baby
here
because
we

and
he
does
want
to
recognize
her
as
his
mother
she
who
is

he
looks
down
upon
her
as
if
she
were
only
the
mother
of
us
three
bastards
wretch
says
all
this
very
rapidly
excitedly
at
the
word

she
raises
her
voice
and
almost
spits
out
the
final
wretch
the
mother
the
manager
in
in
the
name
of
these
two
little
children
i
beg
you
grows
faint
and
is
about
to
oh
god
the
father
forward
to
support
her
as
do
some
of
the
quick
a
chair
a
chair
for
this
poor
widow
the
actors
is
it
true
has
she
really
fainted
the
manager
quick
a
chair
here
of
the
actors
brings
a
chair
the
others
proffer
assistance
the
mother
tries
to
prevent
the
father
from
lifting
the
veil
which
covers
her
the
father
look
at
her
look
at
her
the
mother
no
no
stop
it
please
the
father
her
let
them
see
you
the
mother
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
in
i
beg
you
sir
to
prevent
this
man
from
carrying
out
his
plan
which
is
loathsome
to
me
the
manager
i
do
understand
at
all
what
is
the
situation
is
this
lady
your
wife
the
the
father
yes
gentlemen
my
wife
the
manager
but
how
can
she
be
a
widow
if
you

alive
actors

relief
for
their
astonishment
in
a
loud
the

do
laugh
like
that

just
here
in
this
she
has
had
a
lover
a
man
who
ought
to
be
here
the
mother
a
no
no
the
fortunately
for
her
he

dead
two
months
ago
as
i
said

are
in
mourning
as
you
see
the
father
he
is
here
you
see
not
because
he
is
dead
he
is
here
look
at
her
a
moment
and
you
will
understand
because
her
drama
is
a
drama
of
the
love
of
two
men
for
whom
she
was
incapable
of
feeling
anything
except
possibly
a
little
gratitude
gratitude
not
for
me
but
for
the
other
she
is
a
woman
she
is
a
mother
and
her
drama
powerful
sir
i
assure
you
lies
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
in
these
four
children
she
has
had
by
two
men
the
mother
i
had
them
have
you
got
the
courage
to
say
that
i
wanted
them
the
it
was
his
doing
it
was
he
who
gave
me
that
other
man
who
forced
me
to
go
away
with
him
the
it
is
true
the
mother
not
true
is
it
the
no
it
is
true
it
just
is
true
the
mother
and
what
can
you
know
about
it
the
it
is
true
do
believe
it
do
you
know
why
she
says
so
for
that
fellow
there
the
she
tortures
herself
destroys
herself
on
account
of
the
neglect
of
that
son
there
and
she
wants
him
to
believe
that
if
she
abandoned
him
when
he
was
only
two
years
old
it
was
because
he
the
made
her
do
so
the
mother
he
forced
me
to
it
and
i
call
god
to
witness
it
the
ask
him
if
it
is
true
let
him
speak
you
are
not
in
a
position
to
know
anything
about
it
the
i
know
you
lived
in
peace
and
happiness
with
my
father
while
he
lived
can
you
deny
it
the
mother
no
i
do
deny
it
the
he
was
always
full
of
affection
and
kindness
for
you
the
boy
it
true
it
tell
them
why
do
you
speak
you
little
fool
the
mother
leave
the
poor
boy
alone
why
do
you
want
to
make
me
appear
ungrateful
daughter
i
do
want
to
offend
your
father
i
have
answered
him
that
i
did
abandon
my
house
and
my
son
through
any
fault
of
mine
nor
from
any
wilful
passion
the
father
it
is
true
it
was
my
doing
leading
man
the
what
a
spectacle
leading
lady
we
are
the
audience
this
time
juvenile
lead
for
once
in
a
way
the
manager
to
get
really
hear
them
out
listen
the
son
oh
yes
you
going
to
hear
a
fine
bit
now
he
will
talk
to
you
of
the
demon
of
experiment
the
father
you
are
a
cynical
imbecile
i
told
you
so
already
a
hundred
times
the
he
tries
to
make
fun
of
me
on
account
of
this
expression
which
i
have
found
to
excuse
myself
with
the
son
yes
phrases
phrases
the
father
phrases
is
everyone
consoled
when
faced
with
a
trouble
or
fact
he
does
understand
by
a
word
some
simple
word
which
tells
us
nothing
and
yet
calms
us
the
even
in
the
case
of
remorse
in
fact
especially
then
the
father
remorse
no
that
is
true
i
done
more
than
use
words
to
quieten
the
remorse
in
me
the
yes
there
was
a
bit
of
money
too
yes
yes
a
bit
of
money
there
were
the
hundred
lire
he
was
about
to
offer
me
in
payment
gentlemen
of
horror
among
the
the
son
the
this
is
vile
the
vile
there
they
were
in
a
pale
blue
envelope
on
a
little
mahogany
table
in
the
back
of
madame
pace
shop
you
know
madame
pace
one
of
those
ladies
who
attract
poor
girls
of
good
family
into
their
ateliers
under
the
pretext
of
their
selling
et
the
son
and
he
thinks
he
has
bought
the
right
to
tyrannise
over
us
all
with
those
hundred
lire
he
was
going
to
pay
but
which
fortunately
note
this
gentlemen
he
had
no
chance
of
paying
the
it
was
a
near
thing
though
you
know
the
mother
shame
my
daughter
shame
the
shame
indeed
this
is
my
revenge
i
am
dying
to
live
that
scene
the
room
i
see
it
here
is
the
window
with
the
mantles
exposed
there
the
divan
the
a
screen
there
in
front
of
the
window
the
little
mahogany
table
with
the
blue
envelope
containing
one
hundred
lire
i
see
it
i
see
it
i
could
take
hold
of
it
but
you
gentlemen
you
ought
to
turn
your
backs
now
i
am
almost
nude
you
know
but
i
do
blush
i
leave
that
to
him
the
manager
i
do
understand
this
at
all
the
father
naturally
enough
i
would
ask
you
sir
to
exercise
your
authority
a
little
here
and
let
me
speak
before
you
believe
all
she
is
trying
to
blame
me
with
let
me
explain
the
ah
yes
explain
it
in
your
own
way
the
father
but
do
you
see
that
the
whole
trouble
lies
here
in
words
words
each
one
of
us
has
within
him
a
whole
world
of
things
each
man
of
us
his
own
special
world
and
how
can
we
ever
come
to
an
understanding
if
i
put
in
the
words
i
utter
the
sense
and
value
of
things
as
i
see
them
while
you
who
listen
to
me
must
inevitably
translate
them
according
to
the
conception
of
things
each
one
of
you
has
within
himself
we
think
we
understand
each
other
but
we
never
really
do
look
here
this
woman
the
takes
all
my
pity
for
her
as
a
specially
ferocious
form
of
cruelty
the
mother
but
you
drove
me
away
the
father
do
you
hear
her
i
drove
her
away
she
believes
i
really
sent
her
away
the
mother
you
know
how
to
talk
and
i
do
but
believe
me
sir
after
he
had
married
me
who
knows
why
i
was
a
poor
insignificant
woman
the
father
but
good
heavens
it
was
just
for
your
humility
that
i
married
you
i
loved
this
simplicity
in
you
stops
when
he
sees
she
makes
signs
to
contradict
him
opens
his
arms
wide
in
sign
of
desperation
seeing
how
hopeless
it
is
to
make
himself
you
see
she
denies
it
her
mental
deafness
believe
me
is
phenomenal
the
limit
his
deaf
deaf
mentally
deaf
she
has
plenty
of
feeling
oh
yes
a
good
heart
for
the
children
but
the
brain
deaf
to
the
point
of
desperation
the
yes
but
ask
him
how
his
intelligence
has
helped
us
the
father
if
we
could
see
all
the
evil
that
may
spring
from
good
what
should
we
do
this
point
the
leading
lady
who
is
biting
her
lips
with
rage
at
seeing
the
leading
man
flirting
with
the
comes
forward
and
says
to
the
leading
lady
excuse
me
but
are
we
going
to
rehearse
today
manager
of
course
of
course
but
let
hear
them
out
juvenile
lead
this
is
something
quite
new
most
interesting
leading
lady
yes
for
the
people
who
like
that
kind
of
thing
a
glance
at
leading
the
manager
you
must
please
explain
yourself
quite
clearly
the
father
very
well
then
listen
i
had
in
my
service
a
poor
man
a
clerk
a
secretary
of
mine
full
of
devotion
who
became
friends
with
her
the
they
understood
one
another
were
kindred
souls
in
fact
without
however
the
least
suspicion
of
any
evil
existing
they
were
incapable
even
of
thinking
of
it
the
so
he
thought
of
it
for
them
the
father
that
not
true
i
meant
to
do
good
to
them
and
to
myself
i
confess
at
the
same
time
things
had
come
to
the
point
that
i
could
not
say
a
word
to
either
of
them
without
their
making
a
mute
appeal
one
to
the
other
with
their
eyes
i
could
see
them
silently
asking
each
other
how
i
was
to
be
kept
in
countenance
how
i
was
to
be
kept
quiet
and
this
believe
me
was
just
about
enough
of
itself
to
keep
me
in
a
constant
rage
to
exasperate
me
beyond
measure
the
manager
and
why
did
you
send
him
away
then
this
secretary
of
yours
the
father
precisely
what
i
did
sir
and
then
i
had
to
watch
this
poor
woman
drifting
forlornly
about
the
house
like
an
animal
without
a
master
like
an
animal
one
has
taken
in
out
of
pity
the
mother
ah
yes
the
father
turning
to
the
it
true
about
the
son
anyway
is
it
the
mother
he
took
my
son
away
from
me
first
of
all
the
father
but
not
from
cruelty
i
did
it
so
that
he
should
grow
up
healthy
and
strong
by
living
in
the
country
the
to
him
as
one
can
see
the
father
is
it
my
fault
if
he
has
grown
up
like
this
i
sent
him
to
a
wet
nurse
in
the
country
a
peasant
as
did
not
seem
to
me
strong
enough
though
she
is
of
humble
origin
that
was
anyway
the
reason
i
married
her
unpleasant
all
this
maybe
but
how
can
it
be
helped
my
mistake
possibly
but
there
we
are
all
my
life
i
have
had
these
confounded
aspirations
towards
a
certain
moral
sanity
this
point
the
bursts
out
into
a
noisy
oh
stop
it
stop
it
i
ca
stand
it
the
manager
yes
please
stop
it
for
heaven
sake
the
but
imagine
moral
sanity
from
him
if
you
please
the
client
of
certain
ateliers
like
that
of
madame
pace
the
father
fool
that
is
the
proof
that
i
am
a
man
this
seeming
contradiction
gentlemen
is
the
strongest
proof
that
i
stand
here
a
live
man
before
you
why
it
is
just
for
this
very
incongruity
in
my
nature
that
i
have
had
to
suffer
what
i
have
i
could
not
live
by
the
side
of
that
woman
the
any
longer
but
not
so
much
for
the
boredom
she
inspired
me
with
as
for
the
pity
i
felt
for
her
the
mother
and
so
he
turned
me
out
the
father
well
provided
for
yes
i
sent
her
to
that
man
gentlemen
to
let
her
go
free
of
me
the
mother
and
to
free
himself
the
father
yes
i
admit
it
it
was
also
a
liberation
for
me
but
great
evil
has
come
of
it
i
meant
well
when
i
did
it
and
i
did
it
more
for
her
sake
than
mine
i
swear
it
his
arms
on
his
chest
then
turns
suddenly
to
the
did
i
ever
lose
sight
of
you
until
that
other
man
carried
you
off
to
another
town
like
the
angry
fool
he
was
and
on
account
of
my
pure
interest
in
you
my
pure
interest
i
repeat
that
had
no
base
motive
in
it
i
watched
with
the
tenderest
concern
the
new
family
that
grew
up
around
her
she
can
bear
witness
to
this
to
the
the
oh
yes
that
true
enough
when
i
was
a
kiddie
so
so
high
you
know
with
plaits
over
my
shoulders
and
knickers
longer
than
my
skirts
i
used
to
see
him
waiting
outside
the
school
for
me
to
come
out
he
came
to
see
how
i
was
growing
up
the
father
this
is
infamous
shameful
the
no
why
the
father
infamous
infamous
excitedly
to
manager
after
she
went
away
my
house
seemed
suddenly
empty
she
was
my
incubus
but
she
filled
my
house
i
was
like
a
dazed
fly
alone
in
the
empty
rooms
this
boy
here
the
was
educated
away
from
home
and
when
he
came
back
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
no
more
mine
with
no
mother
to
stand
between
him
and
me
he
grew
up
entirely
for
himself
on
his
own
apart
with
no
tie
of
intellect
or
affection
binding
him
to
me
and
then
strange
but
true
i
was
driven
by
curiosity
at
first
and
then
by
some
tender
sentiment
towards
her
family
which
had
come
into
being
through
my
will
the
thought
of
her
began
gradually
to
fill
up
the
emptiness
i
felt
all
around
me
i
wanted
to
know
if
she
were
happy
in
living
out
the
simple
daily
duties
of
life
i
wanted
to
think
of
her
as
fortunate
and
happy
because
far
away
from
the
complicated
torments
of
my
spirit
and
so
to
have
proof
of
this
i
used
to
watch
that
child
coming
out
of
school
the
yes
yes
true
he
used
to
follow
me
in
the
street
and
smiled
at
me
waved
his
hand
like
this
i
would
look
at
him
with
interest
wondering
who
he
might
be
i
told
my
mother
who
guessed
at
once
mother
agrees
with
a
then
she
did
want
to
send
me
to
school
for
some
days
and
when
i
finally
went
back
there
he
was
again
looking
so
ridiculous
with
a
paper
parcel
in
his
hands
he
came
close
to
me
caressed
me
and
drew
out
a
fine
straw
hat
from
the
parcel
with
a
bouquet
of
flowers
all
for
me
the
manager
a
bit
discursive
this
you
know
the
son
literature
literature
the
father
literature
indeed
this
is
life
this
is
passion
the
manager
it
may
be
but
it
wo
act
the
father
i
agree
this
is
only
the
part
leading
up
i
do
suggest
this
should
be
staged
she
to
the
as
you
see
is
no
longer
the
flapper
with
plaits
down
her
back
the
and
the
knickers
showing
below
the
skirt
the
father
the
drama
is
coming
now
sir
something
new
complex
most
interesting
the
as
soon
as
my
father
died
the
father
there
was
absolute
misery
for
them
they
came
back
here
unknown
to
me
through
her
stupidity
to
the
it
is
true
she
can
barely
write
her
own
name
but
she
could
anyhow
have
got
her
daughter
to
write
to
me
that
they
were
in
need
the
mother
and
how
was
i
to
divine
all
this
sentiment
in
him
the
father
that
is
exactly
your
mistake
never
to
have
guessed
any
of
my
sentiments
the
mother
after
so
many
years
apart
and
all
that
had
happened
the
father
was
it
my
fault
if
that
fellow
carried
you
away
it
happened
quite
suddenly
for
after
he
had
obtained
some
job
or
other
i
could
find
no
trace
of
them
and
so
not
unnaturally
my
interest
in
them
dwindled
but
the
drama
culminated
unforeseen
and
violent
on
their
return
when
i
was
impelled
by
my
miserable
flesh
that
still
lives
ah
what
misery
what
wretchedness
is
that
of
the
man
who
is
alone
and
disdains
debasing
not
old
enough
to
do
without
women
and
not
young
enough
to
go
and
look
for
one
without
shame
misery
it
worse
than
misery
it
a
horror
for
no
woman
can
any
longer
give
him
love
and
when
a
man
feels
this
one
ought
to
do
without
you
say
yes
yes
i
know
each
of
us
when
he
appears
before
his
fellows
is
clothed
in
a
certain
dignity
but
every
man
knows
what
unconfessable
things
pass
within
the
secrecy
of
his
own
heart
one
gives
way
to
the
temptation
only
to
rise
from
it
again
afterwards
with
a
great
eagerness
to
reestablish
one
dignity
as
if
it
were
a
to
place
on
the
grave
of
one
shame
and
a
monument
to
hide
and
sign
the
memory
of
our
weaknesses
everybody
in
the
same
case
some
folks
have
the
courage
to
say
certain
things
that
all
the
all
appear
to
have
the
courage
to
do
them
though
the
father
yes
but
in
secret
therefore
you
want
more
courage
to
say
these
things
let
a
man
but
speak
these
things
out
and
folks
at
once
label
him
a
cynic
but
it
is
true
he
is
like
all
the
others
better
indeed
because
he
is
afraid
to
reveal
with
the
light
of
the
intelligence
the
red
shame
of
human
bestiality
on
which
most
men
close
their
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
it
woman
for
example
look
at
her
case
she
turns
tantalizing
inviting
glances
on
you
you
seize
her
no
sooner
does
she
feel
herself
in
your
grasp
than
she
closes
her
eyes
it
is
the
sign
of
her
mission
the
sign
by
which
she
says
to
man
blind
yourself
for
i
am
blind
the
sometimes
she
can
close
them
no
more
when
she
no
longer
feels
the
need
of
hiding
her
shame
to
herself
but
and
dispassionately
sees
only
that
of
the
man
who
has
blinded
himself
without
love
oh
all
these
intellectual
complications
make
me
sick
disgust
me
all
this
philosophy
that
uncovers
the
beast
in
man
and
then
seeks
to
save
him
excuse
him
i
ca
stand
it
sir
when
a
man
seeks
to
simplify
life
bestially
throwing
aside
every
relic
of
humanity
every
chaste
aspiration
every
pure
feeling
all
sense
of
ideality
duty
modesty
shame
then
nothing
is
more
revolting
and
nauseous
than
a
certain
kind
of
remorse
crocodiles
tears
that
what
it
is
the
manager
let
come
to
the
point
this
is
only
discussion
the
father
very
good
sir
but
a
fact
is
like
a
sack
which
wo
stand
up
when
it
is
empty
in
order
that
it
may
stand
up
one
has
to
put
into
it
the
reason
and
sentiment
which
have
caused
it
to
exist
i
could
possibly
know
that
after
the
death
of
that
man
they
had
decided
to
return
here
that
they
were
in
misery
and
that
she
to
the
had
gone
to
work
as
a
modiste
and
at
a
shop
of
the
type
of
that
of
madame
pace
the
a
real
modiste
you
must
know
gentlemen
in
appearance
she
works
for
the
leaders
of
the
best
society
but
she
arranges
matters
so
that
these
elegant
ladies
serve
her
purpose
without
prejudice
to
other
ladies
who
are
well
only
so
so
the
mother
you
will
believe
me
gentlemen
that
it
never
entered
my
mind
that
the
old
hag
offered
me
work
because
she
had
her
eye
on
my
daughter
the
poor
mamma
do
you
know
sir
what
that
woman
did
when
i
brought
her
back
the
work
my
mother
had
finished
she
would
point
out
to
me
that
i
had
torn
one
of
my
frocks
and
she
would
give
it
back
to
my
mother
to
mend
it
was
i
who
paid
for
it
always
i
while
this
poor
creature
here
believed
she
was
sacrificing
herself
for
me
and
these
two
children
here
sitting
up
at
night
sewing
madame
robes
the
manager
and
one
day
you
met
there
the
him
him
yes
sir
an
old
client
a
scene
for
you
to
play
superb
the
father
she
the
mother
arrived
just
then
the
almost
in
time
the
father
no
in
time
in
time
fortunately
i
recognized
her
in
time
and
i
took
them
back
home
with
me
to
my
house
you
can
imagine
now
her
position
and
mine
she
as
you
see
her
and
i
who
can
not
look
her
in
the
face
the
absurd
how
can
i
possibly
be
expected
after
that
to
be
a
modest
young
miss
a
fit
person
to
go
with
his
confounded
aspirations
for
a
solid
moral
sanity
the
father
for
the
drama
lies
all
in
this
in
the
conscience
that
i
have
that
each
one
of
us
has
we
believe
this
conscience
to
be
a
single
thing
but
it
is
there
is
one
for
this
person
and
another
for
that
diverse
consciences
so
we
have
this
illusion
of
being
one
person
for
all
of
having
a
personality
that
is
unique
in
all
our
acts
but
it
is
true
we
perceive
this
when
tragically
perhaps
in
something
we
do
we
are
as
it
were
suspended
caught
up
in
the
air
on
a
kind
of
hook
then
we
perceive
that
all
of
us
was
not
in
that
act
and
that
it
would
be
an
atrocious
injustice
to
judge
us
by
that
action
alone
as
if
all
our
existence
were
summed
up
in
that
one
deed
now
do
you
understand
the
perfidy
of
this
girl
she
surprised
me
in
a
place
where
she
ought
not
to
have
known
me
just
as
i
could
not
exist
for
her
and
she
now
seeks
to
attach
to
me
a
reality
such
as
i
could
never
suppose
i
should
have
to
assume
for
her
in
a
shameful
and
fleeting
moment
of
my
life
i
feel
this
above
all
else
and
the
drama
you
will
see
acquires
a
tremendous
value
from
this
point
then
there
is
the
position
of
the
others
his
the
the
son
his
shoulders
leave
me
alone
i
do
come
into
this
the
father
what
you
do
come
into
this
the
son
i
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
do
want
to
have
because
you
know
well
enough
i
was
made
to
be
mixed
up
in
all
this
with
the
rest
of
you
the
we
are
only
vulgar
folk
he
is
the
fine
gentleman
you
may
have
noticed
mr
manager
that
i
fix
him
now
and
again
with
a
look
of
scorn
while
he
lowers
his
eyes
for
he
knows
the
evil
he
has
done
me
the
son
looking
at
i
the
you
you
i
owe
my
life
on
the
streets
to
you
did
you
or
did
you
not
deny
us
with
your
behaviour
i
wo
say
the
intimacy
of
home
but
even
that
mere
hospitality
which
makes
guests
feel
at
their
ease
we
were
intruders
who
had
come
to
disturb
the
kingdom
of
your
legitimacy
i
should
like
to
have
you
witness
mr
manager
certain
scenes
between
him
and
me
he
says
i
have
tyrannized
over
everyone
but
it
was
just
his
behaviour
which
made
me
insist
on
the
reason
for
which
i
had
come
into
the
house
this
reason
he
calls
vile
into
his
house
with
my
mother
who
is
his
mother
too
and
i
came
as
mistress
of
the
house
the
son
it
easy
for
them
to
put
me
always
in
the
wrong
but
imagine
gentlemen
the
position
of
a
son
whose
fate
it
is
to
see
arrive
one
day
at
his
home
a
young
woman
of
impudent
bearing
a
young
woman
who
inquires
for
his
father
with
whom
who
knows
what
business
she
has
this
young
man
has
then
to
witness
her
return
bolder
than
ever
accompanied
by
that
child
there
he
is
obliged
to
watch
her
treat
his
father
in
an
equivocal
and
confidential
manner
she
asks
money
of
him
in
a
way
that
lets
one
suppose
he
must
give
it
her
do
you
understand
because
he
has
every
obligation
to
do
so
the
father
but
i
have
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
obligation
i
owe
it
to
your
mother
the
son
how
should
i
know
when
had
i
ever
seen
or
heard
of
her
one
day
there
arrive
with
her
that
lad
and
this
baby
here
i
am
told
this
is
mother
too
you
know
i
divine
from
her
manner
why
it
is
they
have
come
home
i
had
rather
not
say
what
i
feel
and
think
about
it
i
should
even
care
to
confess
to
myself
no
action
can
therefore
be
hoped
for
from
me
in
this
affair
believe
me
mr
manager
i
am
an
unrealized
character
dramatically
speaking
and
i
find
myself
not
at
all
at
ease
in
their
company
leave
me
out
of
it
i
beg
you
the
father
what
it
is
just
because
you
are
so
that
the
son
how
do
you
know
what
i
am
like
when
did
you
ever
bother
your
head
about
me
the
father
i
admit
it
i
admit
it
but
is
that
a
situation
in
itself
this
aloofness
of
yours
which
is
so
cruel
to
me
and
to
your
mother
who
returns
home
and
sees
you
almost
for
the
first
time
grown
up
who
recognize
you
but
knows
you
are
her
son
out
the
mother
to
the
see
she
crying
the
stamping
her
like
a
fool
the
father
she
ca
stand
him
you
know
referring
again
to
the
he
says
he
does
come
into
the
affair
whereas
he
is
really
the
hinge
of
the
whole
action
look
at
that
lad
who
is
always
clinging
to
his
mother
frightened
and
humiliated
it
is
on
account
of
this
fellow
here
possibly
his
situation
is
the
most
painful
of
all
he
feels
himself
a
stranger
more
than
the
others
the
poor
little
chap
feels
mortified
humiliated
at
being
brought
into
a
home
out
of
charity
as
it
were
he
is
the
image
of
his
father
hardly
talks
at
all
humble
and
quiet
the
manager
oh
we
cut
him
out
you
no
notion
what
a
nuisance
boys
are
on
the
stage
the
father
he
disappears
soon
you
know
and
the
baby
too
she
is
the
first
to
vanish
from
the
scene
the
drama
consists
finally
in
this
when
that
mother
my
house
her
family
born
outside
of
it
and
shall
we
say
superimposed
on
the
original
ends
with
the
death
of
the
little
girl
the
tragedy
of
the
boy
and
the
flight
of
the
elder
daughter
it
can
not
go
on
because
it
is
foreign
to
its
surroundings
so
after
much
torment
we
three
remain
i
the
mother
that
son
then
owing
to
the
disappearance
of
that
extraneous
family
we
too
find
ourselves
strange
to
one
another
we
find
we
are
living
in
an
atmosphere
of
mortal
desolation
which
is
the
revenge
as
he
scornfully
said
of
the
demon
of
experiment
that
unfortunately
hides
in
me
thus
sir
you
see
when
faith
is
lacking
it
becomes
impossible
to
create
certain
states
of
happiness
for
we
lack
the
necessary
humility
vaingloriously
we
try
to
substitute
ourselves
for
this
faith
creating
thus
for
the
rest
of
the
world
a
reality
which
we
believe
after
their
fashion
while
actually
it
does
exist
for
each
one
of
us
has
his
own
reality
to
be
respected
before
god
even
when
it
is
harmful
to
one
very
self
the
manager
there
is
something
in
what
you
say
i
assure
you
all
this
interests
me
very
much
i
begin
to
think
there
the
stuff
for
a
drama
in
all
this
and
not
a
bad
drama
either
the
when
you
got
a
character
like
me
the
father
her
up
all
excited
to
learn
the
decision
of
the
you
be
quiet
the
manager
heedless
of
new
hem
yes
the
father
absolutely
new
the
manager
you
got
a
nerve
though
i
must
say
to
come
here
and
fling
it
at
me
like
this
the
father
you
will
understand
sir
born
as
we
are
for
the
stage
the
manager
are
you
amateur
actors
then
the
father
no
i
say
born
for
the
stage
because
the
manager
oh
nonsense
you
an
old
hand
you
know
the
father
no
sir
no
we
act
that
rôle
for
which
we
have
been
cast
that
rôle
which
we
are
given
in
life
and
in
my
own
case
passion
itself
as
usually
happens
becomes
a
trifle
theatrical
when
it
is
exalted
the
manager
well
well
that
will
do
but
you
see
without
an
author
i
could
give
you
the
address
of
an
author
if
you
like
the
father
no
no
look
here
you
must
be
the
author
the
manager
i
what
are
you
talking
about
the
father
yes
you
you
why
not
the
manager
because
i
have
never
been
an
author
why
the
father
then
why
not
turn
author
now
everybody
does
it
you
do
want
any
special
qualities
your
task
is
made
much
easier
by
the
fact
that
we
are
all
here
alive
before
you
the
manager
it
wo
do
the
father
what
when
you
see
us
live
our
drama
the
manager
yes
that
all
right
but
you
want
someone
to
write
it
the
father
no
no
someone
to
take
it
down
possibly
while
we
play
it
scene
by
scene
it
will
be
enough
to
sketch
it
out
at
first
and
then
try
it
over
the
manager
well
i
am
almost
tempted
it
a
bit
of
an
idea
one
might
have
a
shot
at
it
the
father
of
course
you
see
what
scenes
will
come
out
of
it
i
can
give
you
one
at
once
the
manager
by
jove
it
tempts
me
i
like
to
have
a
go
at
it
let
try
it
out
come
with
me
to
my
office
to
the
you
are
at
liberty
for
a
bit
but
do
stop
out
of
the
theatre
for
long
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
twenty
minutes
all
back
here
again
the
we
see
what
can
be
done
who
knows
if
we
do
get
something
really
extraordinary
out
of
it
the
father
there
no
doubt
about
it
they
the
had
better
come
with
us
too
had
they
the
manager
yes
yes
come
on
come
on
away
and
then
turning
to
the
be
punctual
please
and
the
six
characters
cross
the
stage
and
go
off
the
other
actors
remain
looking
at
one
another
in
leading
man
is
he
serious
what
the
devil
does
he
want
to
do
juvenile
lead
this
is
rank
madness
third
actor
does
he
expect
to
knock
up
a
drama
in
five
minutes
juvenile
lead
like
the
improvisers
leading
lady
if
he
thinks
i
going
to
take
part
in
a
joke
like
this
juvenile
lead
i
out
of
it
anyway
fourth
actor
i
should
like
to
know
who
they
are
to
third
actor
what
do
you
suppose
madmen
or
rascals
juvenile
lead
and
he
takes
them
seriously
vanity
he
fancies
himself
as
an
author
now
leading
man
it
absolutely
unheard
of
if
the
stage
has
come
to
this
well
i
fifth
actor
it
rather
a
joke
third
actor
well
we
see
what
going
to
happen
next
talking
the
actors
leave
the
stage
some
going
out
by
the
little
door
at
the
back
others
retiring
to
their
curtain
remains
action
of
the
play
is
suspended
for
twenty
act
ii
stage
ring
to
warn
the
company
that
the
play
is
about
to
begin
the
out
of
the
manager
office
along
the
child
the
boy
she
comes
out
of
the
office
she
nonsense
nonsense
do
it
yourselves
i
not
going
to
mix
myself
up
in
this
mess
to
the
child
and
coming
quickly
with
her
on
to
the
come
on
rosetta
run
the
boy
them
slowly
remaining
a
little
behind
and
seeming
the
bends
over
the
child
and
takes
the
latter
face
between
her
my
little
darling
you
frightened
are
you
you
do
know
where
we
are
do
you
to
reply
to
a
question
of
the
what
is
the
stage
it
a
place
baby
you
know
where
people
play
at
being
serious
a
place
where
they
act
comedies
we
got
to
act
a
comedy
now
dead
serious
you
know
and
you
in
it
also
little
one
her
pressing
the
little
head
to
her
breast
and
rocking
the
child
for
a
oh
darling
darling
what
a
horrid
comedy
you
got
to
play
what
a
wretched
part
found
for
you
a
garden
a
fountain
look
just
suppose
kiddie
it
here
where
you
say
why
right
here
in
the
middle
it
all
pretence
you
know
that
the
trouble
my
pet
it
all
here
it
better
to
imagine
it
though
because
if
they
fix
it
up
for
you
only
be
painted
cardboard
painted
cardboard
for
the
rockery
the
water
the
plants
ah
but
i
think
a
baby
like
this
one
would
sooner
have
a
fountain
than
a
real
one
so
she
could
play
with
it
what
a
joke
it
be
for
the
others
but
for
you
alas
not
quite
such
a
joke
you
who
are
real
baby
dear
and
really
play
by
a
real
fountain
this
big
and
green
and
beautiful
with
ever
so
many
bamboos
around
it
that
are
reflected
in
the
water
and
a
whole
lot
of
little
ducks
swimming
about
no
rosetta
no
your
mother
does
bother
about
you
on
account
of
that
wretch
of
a
son
there
i
in
the
devil
of
a
temper
and
as
for
that
lad
boy
by
the
arm
to
force
him
to
take
one
of
his
hands
out
of
his
what
have
you
got
there
what
are
you
hiding
his
hand
out
of
his
pocket
looks
into
it
and
catches
the
glint
of
a
ah
where
did
you
get
this
the
boy
pale
in
the
face
looks
at
her
but
does
not
idiot
if
i
been
in
your
place
instead
of
killing
myself
i
have
shot
one
of
those
two
or
both
of
them
father
and
son
the
father
from
the
office
all
excited
from
his
the
manager
the
father
come
on
come
on
dear
come
here
for
a
minute
we
arranged
everything
it
all
fixed
up
the
manager
if
you
please
young
lady
there
are
one
or
two
points
to
settle
still
will
you
come
along
the
him
towards
the
ouff
what
the
good
if
you
arranged
everything
the
father
manager
back
into
the
office
again
off
for
a
moment
at
the
same
time
the
son
the
mother
the
son
at
the
three
entering
oh
this
is
fine
fine
and
to
think
i
ca
even
get
away
the
mother
to
look
at
him
but
lowers
her
eyes
immediately
when
he
turns
away
from
her
she
then
sits
the
boy
the
child
her
she
casts
a
glance
again
at
the
son
and
speaks
with
humble
tones
trying
to
draw
him
into
the
mother
and
is
my
punishment
the
worst
of
all
seeing
from
the
sons
manner
that
he
will
not
bother
himself
about
my
god
why
are
you
so
cruel
is
it
enough
for
one
person
to
support
all
this
torment
must
you
then
insist
on
others
seeing
it
also
the
son
to
himself
meaning
the
mother
to
hear
and
they
want
to
put
it
on
the
stage
if
there
was
at
least
a
reason
for
it
he
thinks
he
has
got
at
the
meaning
of
it
all
just
as
if
each
one
of
us
in
every
circumstance
of
life
could
find
his
own
explanation
of
it
he
complains
he
was
discovered
in
a
place
where
he
ought
not
to
have
been
seen
in
a
moment
of
his
life
which
ought
to
have
remained
hidden
and
kept
out
of
the
reach
of
that
convention
which
he
has
to
maintain
for
other
people
and
what
about
my
case
have
i
had
to
reveal
what
no
son
ought
ever
to
reveal
how
father
and
mother
live
and
are
man
and
wife
for
themselves
quite
apart
from
that
idea
of
father
and
mother
which
we
give
them
when
this
idea
is
revealed
our
life
is
then
linked
at
one
point
only
to
that
man
and
that
woman
and
as
such
it
should
shame
them
should
it
the
mother

face

her

a
handful
of
paper
which

but
excuse
me
we
the
manager
her
do
worry
you
have
to
improvise
leading
man
what
have
we
to
do
then
the
manager
nothing
for
the
moment
you
just
watch
and
listen
everybody
will
get
his
part
written
out
afterwards
at
present

going
to
try
the
thing
as
best
we
can
they
going
to
act
now
the
father
if
fallen
from
the
clouds
into
the
confusion
of
the
we
what
do
you
mean
if
you
please
by
a
rehearsal
the
manager
a
rehearsal
for
them
to
the
the
father
but
since
we
are
the
characters
the
manager
all
right
characters
then
if
you
insist
on
calling
yourselves
such
but
here
my
dear
sir
the
characters
do
act
here
the
actors
do
the
acting
the
characters
are
there
in
the
book
towards
prompter
when
there
is
a
book
the
father
i
wo
contradict
you
but
excuse
me
the
actors
are
the
characters
they
want
to
be
they
pretend
to
be
do
they
now
if
these
gentlemen
here
are
fortunate
enough
to
have
us
alive
before
them
the
manager
oh
this
is
grand
you
want
to
come
before
the
public
yourselves
then
the
father
as
we
are
the
manager
i
can
assure
you
it
would
be
a
magnificent
spectacle
leading
man
what
the
use
of
us
here
anyway
then
the
manager
you
not
going
to
pretend
that
you
can
act
it
makes
me
laugh
actors
there
you
see
they
are
laughing
at
the
notion
but
by
the
way
i
must
cast
the
parts
that
wo
be
difficult
they
cast
themselves
the
second
lady
you
play
the
mother
the
we
must
find
her
a
name
the
father
amalia
sir
the
manager
but
that
is
the
real
name
of
your
wife
we
do
want
to
call
her
by
her
real
name
the
father
why
ever
not
if
it
is
her
name
still
perhaps
if
that
lady
must
a
slight
motion
of
the
hand
to
indicate
the
second
lady
i
see
this
woman
here
the
as
amalia
but
do
as
you
like
more
and
more
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
already
i
begin
to
hear
my
own
words
ring
false
as
if
they
had
another
sound
the
manager
do
you
worry
about
it
it
be
our
job
to
find
the
right
tones
and
as
for
her
name
if
you
want
her
amalia
amalia
it
shall
be
and
if
you
do
like
it
find
another
for
the
moment
though
we
call
the
characters
in
this
way
juvenile
you
are
the
son
the
leading
you
naturally
are
the
the
what
what
i
that
woman
there
out
the
manager
what
is
there
to
laugh
at
leading
lady
nobody
has
ever
dared
to
laugh
at
me
i
insist
on
being
treated
with
respect
otherwise
i
go
away
the
no
no
excuse
me
i
am
not
laughing
at
you
the
manager
you
ought
to
feel
honoured
to
be
played
by
leading
lady
once
that
woman
there
the
but
i
was
speaking
of
you
you
know
i
was
speaking
of
myself
whom
i
ca
see
at
all
in
you
that
is
all
i
do
know
but
you
are
in
the
least
like
me

point

here
sir
our
temperaments
our
souls
the
manager
temperament
soul
be
hanged
do
you
suppose
the
spirit
of
the
piece
is
in
you
nothing
of
the
kind
the
father
what
have
we
our
own
temperaments
our
own
souls
the
manager
not
at
all
your
soul
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
takes
shape
here
the
actors
give
body
and
form
to
it
voice
and
gesture
and
my
actors
i
may
tell
you
have
given
expression
to
much
more
lofty
material
than
this
little
drama
of
yours
which
may
or
may
not
hold
up
on
the
stage
but
if
it
does
the
merit
of
it
believe
me
will
be
due
to
my
actors
the
father
i
do
dare
contradict
you
sir
but
believe
me
it
is
a
terrible
suffering
for
us
who
are
as
we
are
with
these
bodies
of
ours
these
features
to
see
the
manager
him
short
and
out
of
good
heavens
the
will
remedy
all
that
man
the
the
father
maybe
but
the
voice
the
gestures
the
manager
now
look
here
on
the
stage
you
as
yourself
can
not
exist
the
actor
here
acts
you
and
that
an
end
to
it
the
father
i
understand
and
now
i
think
i
see
why
our
author
who
conceived
us
as
we
are
all
alive
did
want
to
put
us
on
the
stage
after
all
i
have
the
least
desire
to
offend
your
actors
far
from
it
but
when
i
think
that
i
am
to
be
acted
by
i
do
know
by
whom
leading
man
his
by
me
if
you
no
objection
the
father
honoured
i
assure
you
sir
still
i
must
say
that
try
as
this
gentleman
may
with
all
his
good
will
and
wonderful
art
to
absorb
me
into
himself
leading
man
oh
chuck
it
wonderful
art
withdraw
that
please
the
father
the
performance
he
will
give
even
doing
his
best
with
to
look
like
me
leading
man
it
will
certainly
be
a
rat
difficult
actors
the
father
exactly
it
will
be
difficult
to
act
me
as
i
really
am
the
effect
will
be
rather
apart
from
the
according
as
to
how
he
supposes
i
am
as
he
senses
me
if
he
does
sense
me
and
not
as
i
inside
of
myself
feel
myself
to
be
it
seems
to
me
then
that
account
should
be
taken
of
this
by
everyone
whose
duty
it
may
become
to
criticize
us
the
manager
heavens
the
man
starting
to
think
about
the
critics
now
let
them
say
what
they
like
it
up
to
us
to
put
on
the
play
if
we
can
come
on
come
on
is
the
stage
set
the
actors
and
stand
back
stand
back
let
me
see
and
do
let
lose
any
more
time
the
is
it
all
right
as
it
is
now
the
well
to
tell
the
truth
i
recognize
the
scene
the
manager
my
dear
lady

ca
possibly
suppose
that
we
can
construct
that
shop
of
madame
pace
piece
by
piece
here
the
you
said
a
white
room
with
flowered
wall
paper
did
you

father

furniture

or
less

little
table

bit
further
forward

the
order

more
useless
discussions

but

the
manager

but
where

the
father
one
minute
let
me
speak
to
the
if
these
ladies
would
be
so
good
as
to
give
me
their
hats
for
a
moment
the
actresses
surprised
half
laughing
in
what
why
our
hats
what
does
he
say
the
manager
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
ladies
hats
actors
the
father
oh
nothing
i
just
want
to
put
them
on
these
pegs
for
a
moment
and
one
of
the
ladies
will
be
so
kind
as
to
take
off
her
mantle
the
actors
oh
what
think
of
that
only
the
mantle
he
must
be
mad
some
actresses
but
why
mantles
as
well
the
father
to
hang
them
up
here
for
a
moment
please
be
so
kind
will
you
the
actresses
off
their
hats
one
or
two
also
their
cloaks
and
going
to
hang
them
on
the
after
all
why
not
there
you
are
this
is
really
funny
we
got
to
put
them
on
show
the
father
exactly
just
like
that
on
show
the
manager
may
we
know
why
the
father
i
tell
you
who
knows
if
by
arranging
the
stage
for
her
she
does
not
come
here
herself
attracted
by
the
very
articles
of
her
trade
the
actors
to
look
towards
the
exit
at
back
of
look
look
door
at
the
back
of
stage
opens
madame
pace
and
takes
a
few
steps
forward
she
is
a
fat
oldish
woman
with
puffy
oxygenated
hair
she
is
rouged
and
powdered
dressed
with
a
comical
elegance
in
black
silk
round
her
waist
is
a
long
silver
chain
from
which
hangs
a
pair
of
scissors
the
runs
over
to
her
at
once
amid
the
stupor
of
the
the
towards
there
she
is
there
she
is
the
father
it
she
i
said
so
did
i
there
she
is
the
manager
his
surprise
and
then
becoming
what
sort
of
a
trick
is
this
leading
man
at
the
same
what
going
to
happen
next
juvenile
lead
where
does
come
from
they
been
holding
her
in
reserve
i
guess
leading
lady
a
vulgar
trick
the
father
the
excuse
me
all
of
you
why
are
you
so
anxious
to
destroy
in
the
name
of
a
vulgar
commonplace
sense
of
truth
this
reality
which
comes
to
birth
attracted
and
formed
by
the
magic
of
the
stage
itself
which
has
indeed
more
right
to
live
here
than
you
since
it
is
much
truer
than
you
if
you
do
mind
my
saying
so
which
is
the
actress
among
you
who
is
to
play
madame
pace
well
here
is
madame
pace
herself
and
you
will
allow
i
fancy
that
the
actress
who
acts
her
will
be
less
true
than
this
woman
here
who
is
herself
in
person
you
see
my
daughter
recognized
her
and
went
over
to
her
at
once
now
you
going
to
witness
the
scene
the
scene
between
madame
pace
already
begun
despite
the
protest
of
the
actors
and
the
reply
the
father
has
begun
quietly
naturally
in
a
manner
impossible
for
the
stage
so
when
the
actors
called
to
attention
the
father
round
and
madame
pace
has
placed
one
hand
under
to
raise
her
head
they
observe
her
at
first
with
great
attention
but
hearing
her
speak
in
an
unintelligible
manner
their
interest
begins
to
the
manager
well
well
leading
man
what
does
she
say
leading
lady
one
ca
hear
a
word
juvenile
lead
louder
louder
please
the
madame
pace
who
smiles
a
smile
and
advancing
towards
the
louder
louder
what
are
you
talking
about
these
matters
which
can
be
shouted
at
the
top
of
one
voice
if
i
have
spoken
them
out
loud
it
was
to
shame
him
and
have
my
revenge
but
for
madame
it
quite
a
different
matter
the
manager
indeed
indeed
but
here
you
know
people
have
got
to
make
themselves
heard
my
dear
even
we
who
are
on
the
stage
ca
hear
you
what
will
it
be
when
the
in
the
theatre
and
anyway
you
can
very
well
speak
up
now
among
yourselves
since
we
sha
be
present
to
listen
to
you
as
we
are
now
you
got
to
pretend
to
be
alone
in
a
room
at
the
back
of
a
shop
where
no
one
can
hear
you
the
and
with
a
touch
of
malice
makes
a
sign
of
disagreement
two
or
three
times
with
her
the
manager
what
do
you
mean
by
no
the
voce
someone
who
will
hear
us
if
she
madame
speaks
out
loud
the
manager
what
have
you
got
someone
else
to
spring
on
us
now
actors
burst
out
the
father
no
no
sir
she
is
alluding
to
me
i
got
to
be
here
there
behind
that
door
in
waiting
and
madame
pace
knows
it
in
fact
if
you
will
allow
me
i
go
there
at
once
so
i
can
be
quite
ready
the
manager
no
wait
wait
we
must
observe
the
conventions
of
the
theatre
before
you
are
ready
the
no
get
on
with
it
at
once
i
just
dying
i
tell
you
to
act
this
scene
if
he
ready
i
more
than
ready
the
manager
but
my
dear
young
lady
first
of
all
we
must
have
the
scene
between
you
and
this
lady
madame
do
you
understand
the
good
heavens
she
been
telling
me
what
you
know
already
that
mamma
work
is
badly
done
again
that
the
material
ruined
and
that
if
i
want
her
to
continue
to
help
us
in
our
misery
i
must
be
patient
madame
pace
forward
with
an
air
of
great
yes
indeed
sir
i
no
wanta
take
advantage
of
her
i
no
wanta
be
hard
madame
face
is
supposed
to
talk
in
a
jargon
half
italian
half
the
manager
what
what
she
talks
like
that
actors
burst
out
laughing
the
yes
yes
that
the
way
she
talks
half
english
half
italian
most
comical
it
is
madame
pace
itta
seem
not
verra
polite
gentlemen
laugha
atta
me
eef
i
trya
best
speaka
english
the
manager
of
course
of
course
let
her
talk
like
that
just
what
we
want
talk
just
like
that
madam
if
you
please
the
effect
will
be
certain
exactly
what
was
wanted
to
put
a
little
comic
relief
into
the
crudity
of
the
situation
of
course
she
talks
like
that
magnificent
the
magnificent
certainly
when
certain
suggestions
are
made
to
one
in
language
of
that
kind
the
effect
is
certain
since
it
seems
almost
a
joke
one
feels
inclined
to
laugh
when
one
hears
her
talk
about
an
old
signore
who
wanta
talka
nicely
with
you
nice
old
signore
eh
madame
madame
pace
not
so
old
my
dear
not
so
old
and
even
if
you
no
lika
him
he
wo
make
any
scandal
the
mother
up
amid
the
amazement
and
consternation
of
the
actors
who
had
not
been
noticing
her
they
move
to
restrain
you
old
devil
you
murderess
the
over
to
calm
her
calm
yourself
mother
calm
yourself
please
do
the
father
to
her
also
at
the
same
calm
yourself
do
get
excited
sit
down
now
the
mother
well
then
take
that
woman
away
out
of
my
sight
the
it
is
impossible
for
my
mother
to
remain
here
the
father
they
ca
be
here
together
and
for
this
reason
you
see
that
woman
there
was
not
with
us
when
we
came
if
they
are
on
together
the
whole
thing
is
given
away
inevitably
as
you
see
the
manager
it
does
matter
this
is
only
a
first
rough
sketch
just
to
get
an
idea
of
the
various
points
of
the
scene
even
confusedly
to
the
mother
and
leading
her
to
her
come
along
my
dear
lady

down

get
on
with

scene

way
or
another

peculiar
tone

special
tone

looks
undecided
and

on
with
it

down
there
to
the
back
of
the
stage
you
need
go
off
then
come
right
forward
here
the
father
as
he
is
told
looking
troubled
and
perplexed
at
first
but
as
soon
as
he
begins
to
move
the
reality
of
the
action
affects
him
and
he
begins
to
smile
and
to
be
more
natural
the
actors
watch
the
manager
quickly
to
the
prompter
in
his
ready
ready
get
ready
to
write
now
the
father
forward
and
speaking
in
a
different
good
afternoon
miss
the
bowed
down
slightly
with
restrained
good
afternoon
the
father
under
her
hat
which
partly
covers
her
face
perceiving
she
is
very
young
he
makes
an
exclamation
partly
of
surprise
partly
of
fear
lest
he
compromise
himself
in
a
risky
ah
but
ah
i
say
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
you
have
come
here
is
it
the
no
sir
the
father

here
before
eh
seeing
her
nod
more
than
once
for
her
to
answer

under
her
hat

your
hat

and
with
veiled

the
progress
of
the
scene

son
the
other
two
children
who
cling
to
her
is
on
thorns
and
follows
with
varying
expressions
of
sorrow
indignation
anxiety
and
horror
the
words
and
actions
of
the
other
two
from
time
to
time
she
hides
her
face
in
her
hands
and
the
mother
oh
my
god
my
god
the
father
his
part
with
a
touch
of
give
it
to
me
i
put
it
down
hat
from
her
but
a
dear
little
head
like
yours

to
have
a
smarter
hat

one
from
the
stock
wo

i
say

are
our
hats

always
a
way
round
these
little
matters
you

the
best
coming
now
why
ca
we
go

bowed
down
a
bit
the
but
she
is
dressed
in
black
leading
lady
but
i
shall
be
and
much
more
effectively
than
you
the
manager
be
quiet
please
and
watch
you
be
able
to
learn
something
his
come
on
come
on
entrance
please
door
at
rear
of
stage
opens
and
the
leading
man
enters
with
the
lively
manner
of
an
old
gallant
the
rendering
of
the
scene
by
the
actors
from
the
very
first
words
is
seen
to
be
quite
a
different
thing
though
it
has
not
in
any
way
the
air
of
a
parody
naturally
the
and
the
father
not
being
able
to
recognize
themselves
in
the
leading
lady
and
the
leading
man
who
deliver
their
words
in
different
tones
and
with
a
different
psychology
express
sometimes
with
smiles
sometimes
with
gestures
the
impression
they
leading
man
good
afternoon
miss
the
father
once
unable
to
contain
no
no
the
the
way
leading
man
bursts
out
the
manager
silence
and
you
please
just
stop
that
laughing
if
we
go
on
like
this
we
shall
never
finish
the
forgive
me
sir
but
it
natural
enough
this
lady
leading
stands
there
still
but
if
she
is
supposed
to
be
me
i
can
assure
you
that
if
i
heard
anyone
say
good
afternoon
in
that
manner
and
in
that
tone
i
should
burst
out
laughing
as
i
did
the
father
yes
yes
the
manner
the
tone
the
manager
nonsense
rubbish
stand
aside
and
let
me
see
the
action
leading
man
if
i
got
to
represent
an
old
fellow
coming
into
a
house
of
an
equivocal
character
the
manager
do
listen
to
them
for
heaven
sake
do
it
again
it
goes
fine
for
the
actors
to
begin
well
leading
man
good
afternoon
miss
leading
lady
good
afternoon
leading
man
the
gesture
of
the
father
when
he
looked
under
the
hat
and
then
expressing
quite
clearly
first
satisfaction
and
then
ah
but
i
say
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
you
have
come
here
is
it
the
manager
good
but
not
quite
so
heavily
like
this
this
is
the
first
time
that
you
have
come
here
leading
and
you
say
no
sir
leading
lady
no
sir
leading
man
you
been
here
before
more
than
once
the
manager
no
no
stop
let
her
nod
yes
first
you
been
here
before
eh
leading
lady
lifts
up
her
head
slightly
and
closes
her
eyes
as
though
in
disgust
then
she
inclines
her
head
the
to
contain
oh
my
god
a
hand
to
her
mouth
to
prevent
herself
from
the
manager
what
the
matter
the
nothing
nothing
the
manager
leading
go
on
leading
man
you
been
here
before
eh
well
then
no
need
to
be
so
shy
is
there
may
i
take
off
your
hat
the
leading
man
this
last
speech
in
such
a
tone
and
with
such
gestures
that
she
has
her
hand
to
her
mouth
can
not
keep
from
leading
lady
i
not
going
to
stop
here
to
be
made
a
fool
of
by
that
woman
there
leading
man
neither
am
i
i
through
with
it
the
manager
to
silence
for
once
and
all
i
tell
you
the
forgive
me
forgive
me
the
manager
you
have
any
manners
that
what
it
is
you
go
too
far
the
father
to
yes
it
true
but
excuse
her
the
manager
excuse
what
it
absolutely
disgusting
the
father
yes
sir
but
believe
me
it
has
such
a
strange
effect
when
the
manager
strange
why
strange
where
is
it
strange
the
father
no
sir
i
admire
your
actors
this
gentleman
here
this
lady
but
they
are
certainly
not
us
the
manager
i
should
hope
not
evidently
they
can
not
be
you
if
they
are
actors
the
father
just
so
actors
both
of
them
act
our
parts
exceedingly
well
but
believe
me
it
produces
quite
a
different
effect
on
us
they
want
to
be
us
but
they
are
all
the
same
the
manager
what
is
it
then
anyway
the
father
something
that
is
that
is
theirs
and
no
longer
ours
the
manager
but
naturally
inevitably
i
told
you
so
already
the
father
yes
i
understand
i
understand
the
manager
well
then
let
have
no
more
of
it
to
the
we
have
the
rehearsals
by
ourselves
afterwards
in
the
ordinary
way
i
never
could
stand
rehearsing
with
the
author
present
he
never
satisfied
to
father
and
come
on
let
get
on
with
it
again
and
try
and
see
if
you
ca
keep
from
laughing
the
oh
i
sha
laugh
any
more
there
a
nice
little
bit
coming
for
me
now
you
see
the
manager
well
then
when
she
says
do
think
any
more
of
what
i
said
i
must
forget
you
the
come
in
sharp
with
i
understand
i
understand
and
then
you
ask
her
the
what
the
manager
why
she
is
in
mourning
the
not
at
all
see
here
when
i
told
him
that
it
was
useless
for
me
to
be
thinking
about
my
wearing
mourning
do
you
know
how
he
answered
me
ah
well
he
said
then
let
take
off
this
little
frock
the
manager
great
just
what
we
want
to
make
a
riot
in
the
theatre
the
but
it
the
truth
the
manager
what
does
that
matter
acting
is
our
business
here
truth
up
to
a
certain
point
but
no
further
the
what
do
you
want
to
do
then
the
manager
you
see
you
see
leave
it
to
me
the
no
sir
what
you
want
to
do
is
to
piece
together
a
little
romantic
sentimental
scene
out
of
my
disgust
out
of
all
the
reasons
each
more
cruel
and
viler
than
the
other
why
i
am
what
i
am
he
is
to
ask
me
why
in
mourning
and
i
to
answer
with
tears
in
my
eyes
that
it
is
just
two
months
since
papa
died
no
sir
no
he
got
to
say
to
me
as
he
did
say
well
let
take
off
this
little
dress
at
once
and
i
with
my
two
months
mourning
in
my
heart
went
there
behind
that
screen
and
with
these
fingers
tingling
with
shame
the
manager
his
hands
through
his
for
heaven
sake
what
are
you
saying
the
out
the
truth
the
truth
the
manager
it
may
be
i
do
deny
it
and
i
can
understand
all
your
horror
but
you
must
surely
see
that
you
ca
have
this
kind
of
thing
on
the
stage
it
wo
go
the
not
possible
eh
very
well
i
much
obliged
to
you
but
i
off
the
manager
now
be
reasonable
do
lose
your
temper
the
i
wo
stop
here
i
wo
i
can
see
you
fixed
it
all
up
with
him
in
your
office
all
this
talk
about
what
is
possible
for
the
stage
i
understand
he
wants
to
get
at
his
complicated
cerebral
drama
to
have
his
famous
remorses
and
torments
acted
but
i
want
to
act
my
part
the
manager
shaking
his
ah
just
part
but
if
you
will
pardon
me
there
are
other
parts
than
yours
his
the
and
hers
the
on
the
stage
you
ca
have
a
character
becoming
too
prominent
and
overshadowing
all
the
others
the
thing
is
to
pack
them
all
into
a
neat
little
framework
and
then
act
what
is
actable
i
am
aware
of
the
fact
that
everyone
has
his
own
interior
life
which
he
wants
very
much
to
put
forward
but
the
difficulty
lies
in
this
fact
to
set
out
just
so
much
as
is
necessary
for
the
stage
taking
the
other
characters
into
consideration
and
at
the
same
time
hint
at
the
unrevealed
interior
life
of
each
i
am
willing
to
admit
my
dear
young
lady
that
from
your
point
of
view
it
would
be
a
fine
idea
if
each
character
could
tell
the
public
all
his
troubles
in
a
nice
monologue
or
a
regular
one
hour
lecture
you
must
restrain
yourself
my
dear
and
in
your
own
interest
too
because
this
fury
of
yours
this
exaggerated
disgust
you
show
may
make
a
bad
impression
you
know
after
you
have
confessed
to
me
that
there
were
others
before
him
at
madame
pace
and
more
than
once
the
her
head
it
true
but
remember
those
others
mean
him
for
me
all
the
same
the
manager
what
the
others
what
do
you
mean
the
for
one
who
has
gone
wrong
sir
he
who
was
responsible
for
the
first
fault
is
responsible
for
all
that
follow
he
is
responsible
for
my
faults
was
even
before
i
was
born
look
at
him
and
see
if
it
is
true
the
manager
well
well
and
does
the
weight
of
so
much
responsibility
seem
nothing
to
you
give
him
a
chance
to
act
it
to
get
it
over
the
how
how
can
he
act
all
his
noble
remorses
all
his
moral
torments
if
you
want
to
spare
him
the
horror
of
being
discovered
one
day
after
he
had
asked
her
what
he
did
ask
her
in
the
arms
of
her
that
already
fallen
woman
that
child
sir
that
child
he
used
to
watch
come
out
of
school
is
the
mother
this
point
is
overcome
with
emotion
and
breaks
out
into
a
fit
of
crying
all
are
touched
a
long
the
soon
as
the
mother
becomes
a
little
quieter
adds
resolutely
and
at
present
we
are
unknown
to
the
public
tomorrow
you
will
act
us
as
you
wish
treating
us
in
your
own
manner
but
do
you
really
want
to
see
drama
do
you
want
to
see
it
flash
out
as
it
really
did
the
manager
of
course
that
just
what
i
do
want
so
i
can
use
as
much
of
it
as
is
possible
the
well
then
ask
that
mother
there
to
leave
us
the
mother
her
low
plaint
into
a
sharp
no
no
do
permit
it
sir
do
permit
it
the
manager
but
it
only
to
try
it
the
mother
i
ca
bear
it
i
ca
the
manager
but
since
it
has
happened
already
i
understand
the
mother
it
taking
place
now
it
happens
all
the
time
my
torment
is
a
pretended
one
i
live
and
feel
every
minute
of
my
torture
those
two
children
there
have
you
heard
them
speak
they
ca
speak
any
more
they
cling
to
me
to
keep
my
torment
actual
and
vivid
for
me
but
for
themselves
they
do
not
exist
they
are
any
more
and
she
has
run
away
she
has
left
me
and
is
lost
if
i
now
see
her
here
before
me
it
is
only
to
renew
for
me
the
tortures
i
have
suffered
for
her
too
the
father
the
eternal
moment
she
the
is
here
to
catch
me
fix
me
and
hold
me
eternally
in
the
stocks
for
that
one
fleeting
and
shameful
moment
of
my
life
she
ca
give
it
up
and
you
sir
can
not
either
fairly
spare
me
it
the
manager
i
never
said
i
did
want
to
act
it
it
will
form
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
nucleus
of
the
whole
first
act
right
up
to
her
surprise
the
the
father
just
so
this
is
my
punishment
the
passion
in
all
of
us
that
must
culminate
in
her
final
cry
the
i
can
hear
it
still
in
my
ears
driven
me
mad
that
cry
you
can
put
me
on
as
you
like
it
does
matter
fully
dressed
if
you
like
provided
i
have
at
least
the
arm
bare
because
standing
like
this
goes
close
to
the
father
and
leans
her
head
on
his
with
my
head
so
and
my
arms
round
his
neck
i
saw
a
vein
pulsing
in
my
arm
here
and
then
as
if
that
live
vein
had
awakened
disgust
in
me
i
closed
my
eyes
like
this
and
let
my
head
sink
on
his
breast
to
the
cry
out
mother
cry
out
head
in
fathers
breast
and
with
her
shoulders
raised
as
if
to
prevent
her
hearing
the
cry
adds
in
tones
of
intense
cry
out
as
you
did
then
the
mother
forward
to
separate
no
my
daughter
my
daughter
after
having
pulled
her
away
from
you
brute
you
brute
she
is
my
daughter
you
see
she
my
daughter
the
manager
backwards
towards
fine
fine
damned
good
and
then
of
course
curtain
the
father
towards
him
yes
of
course
because
that
the
way
it
really
happened
the
manager
and
oh
yes
no
doubt
about
it
curtain
here
curtain
the
reiterated
cry
the
manager
the
machinist
the
curtain
down
the
manager
the
father
front
of
it
before
the
the
manager
the
darned
idiot
i
said
curtain
to
show
the
act
should
end
there
and
he
goes
and
lets
it
down
in
earnest
the
father
while
he
pulls
the
curtain
back
to
go
on
to
the
stage
yes
yes
it
all
right
effect
certain
that
the
right
ending
i
guarantee
the
first
act
at
any
rate
act
iii
the
curtain
goes
up
again
it
is
seen
that
the
stage
hands
have
shifted
the
bit
of
scenery
used
in
the
last
part
and
have
rigged
up
instead
at
the
back
of
the
stage
a
drop
with
some
trees
and
one
or
two
wings
a
portion
of
a
fountain
basin
is
visible
the
mother
is
sitting
on
the
right
with
the
two
children
by
her
side
the
son
is
on
the
same
side
but
away
from
the
others
he
seems
bored
angry
and
full
of
shame
the
father
and
the
are
also
seated
towards
the
right
front
on
the
other
side
left
are
the
actors
much
in
the
positions
they
occupied
before
the
curtain
was
lowered
only
the
manager
is
standing
up
in
the
middle
of
the
stage
with
his
hand
closed
over
his
mouth
in
the
act
of
the
manager
his
shoulders
after
a
brief
ah
yes
the
second
act
leave
it
to
me
leave
it
all
to
me
as
we
arranged
and
you
see
it
go
fine
the
our
entry
into
his
house
in
spite
of
him
the
the
manager
of
leave
it
to
me
i
tell
you
the
do
let
it
be
clear
at
any
rate
that
it
is
in
spite
of
my
wishes
the
mother
her
corner
shaking
her
for
all
the
good
that
come
of
it
the
towards
her
it
does
matter
the
more
harm
done
us
the
more
remorse
for
him
the
manager
i
understand
good
heavens
i
understand
i
taking
it
into
account
the
mother
i
beg
you
sir
to
let
it
appear
quite
plain
that
for
conscience
sake
i
did
try
in
every
way
the
indignantly
and
continuing
for
the
to
pacify
me
to
dissuade
me
from
spiting
him
do
as
she
wants
satisfy
her
because
it
is
true
i
enjoy
it
immensely
anyhow
as
you
can
see
the
meeker
she
is
the
more
she
tries
to
get
at
his
heart
the
more
distant
and
aloof
does
he
become
the
manager
are
we
going
to
begin
this
second
act
or
not
the
i
not
going
to
talk
any
more
now
but
i
must
tell
you
this
you
ca
have
the
whole
action
take
place
in
the
garden
as
you
suggest
it
is
possible
the
manager
why
not
the
because
he
the
son
is
always
shut
up
alone
in
his
room
and
then
there
all
the
part
of
that
poor
boy
there
which
takes
place
indoors
the
manager
maybe
on
the
other
hand
you
will
understand
we
ca
change
scenes
three
or
four
times
in
one
act
the
leading
man
they
used
to
once
the
manager
yes
when
the
public
was
up
to
the
level
of
that
child
there
the
leading
lady
it
makes
the
illusion
easier
the
father
the
illusion
for
heaven
sake
do
say
illusion
please
do
use
that
word
which
is
particularly
painful
for
us
the
manager
and
why
if
you
please
the
father
it
painful
cruel
really
cruel
and
you
ought
to
understand
that
the
manager
but
why
what
ought
we
to
say
then
the
illusion
i
tell
you
sir
which
we
got
to
create
for
the
audience
the
leading
man
with
our
acting
the
manager
the
illusion
of
a
reality
the
father
i
understand
but
you
perhaps
do
not
understand
us
forgive
me
you
see
here
for
you
and
your
actors
the
thing
is
only
and
rightly
so
a
kind
of
game
the
leading
lady
a
game
not
children
here
if
you
please
we
are
serious
actors
the
father
i
do
deny
it
what
i
mean
is
the
game
or
play
of
your
art
which
has
to
give
as
the
gentleman
says
a
perfect
illusion
of
reality
the
manager
precisely
the
father
now
if
you
consider
the
fact
that
we
himself
and
the
other
five
as
we
are
have
no
other
reality
outside
of
this
illusion
the
manager
looking
at
his
actors
who
are
also
and
what
does
that
mean
the
father
watching
them
for
a
moment
with
a
wan
as
i
say
sir
that
which
is
a
game
of
art
for
you
is
our
sole
reality
pause
he
goes
a
step
or
two
nearer
the
manager
and
but
not
only
for
us
you
know
by
the
way
just
you
think
it
over
well
him
in
the
can
you
tell
me
who
you
are
the
manager
half
what
who
am
i
i
am
myself
the
father
and
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
that
is
true
because
you
are
i
the
manager
i
should
say
you
were
mad
actors
the
father
you
quite
right
to
laugh
because
we
are
all
making
believe
here
and
you
can
therefore
object
that
it
only
for
a
joke
that
that
gentleman
there
the
leading
who
naturally
is
himself
has
to
be
me
who
am
on
the
contrary
myself
this
thing
you
see
here
you
see
i
caught
you
in
a
trap
actors
the
manager
but
we
had
all
this
over
once
before
do
you
want
to
begin
again
the
father
no
no
that
was
my
meaning
in
fact
i
should
like
to
request
you
to
abandon
this
game
of
art
at
the
leading
lady
as
if
anticipating
which
you
are
accustomed
to
play
here
with
your
actors
and
to
ask
you
seriously
once
again
who
are
you
the
manager
and
irritated
turning
to
his
if
this
fellow
here
has
got
a
nerve
a
man
who
calls
himself
a
character
comes
and
asks
me
who
i
am
the
father
dignity
but
not
a
character
sir
may
always
asks
a
man
who
he
is
because
a
character
has
really
a
life
of
his
own
marked
with
his
especial
characteristics
for
which
reason
he
is
always
somebody
but
a
man
i
not
speaking
of
you
now
may
very
well
be
nobody
the
manager
yes
but
you
are
asking
these
questions
of
me
the
boss
the
manager
do
you
understand
the
father
but
only
in
order
to
know
if
you
as
you
really
are
now
see
yourself
as
you
once
were
with
all
the
illusions
that
were
yours
then
with
all
the
things
both
inside
and
outside
of
you
as
they
seemed
to
you
as
they
were
then
indeed
for
you
well
sir
if
you
think
of
all
those
illusions
that
mean
nothing
to
you
now
of
all
those
things
which
do
even
to
you
to
exist
any
more
while
once
they
for
you
do
you
feel
that
i
say
these
boards
but
the
very
earth
under
your
feet
is
sinking
away
from
you
when
you
reflect
that
in
the
same
way
this
as
you
feel
it
today
all
this
present
reality
of
yours
is
fated
to
seem
a
mere
illusion
to
you
tomorrow
the
manager
having
understood
much
but
astonished
by
the
specious
well
well
and
where
does
all
this
take
us
anyway
the
father
oh
nowhere
it
only
to
show
you
that
if
we
the
have
no
other
reality
beyond
the
illusion
you
too
must
not
count
overmuch
on
your
reality
as
you
feel
it
today
since
like
that
of
yesterday
it
may
prove
an
illusion
for
you
tomorrow
the
manager
to
make
fun
of
ah
excellent
then
you
be
saying
next
that
you
with
this
comedy
of
yours
that
you
brought
here
to
act
are
truer
and
more
real
than
i
am
the
father
the
greatest
but
of
course
without
doubt
the
manager
ah
really
the
father
why
i
thought
you
understand
that
from
the
beginning
the
manager
more
real
than
i
the
father
if
your
reality
can
change
from
one
day
to
another
the
manager
but
everyone
knows
it
can
change
it
is
always
changing
the
same
as
anyone
else
the
father
a
no
sir
not
ours
look
here
that
is
the
very
difference
our
reality
does
change
it
ca
change
it
ca
be
other
than
what
it
is
because
it
is
already
fixed
for
ever
it
terrible
ours
is
an
immutable
reality
which
should
make
you
shudder
when
you
approach
us
if
you
are
really
conscious
of
the
fact
that
your
reality
is
a
mere
transitory
and
fleeting
illusion
taking
this
form
today
and
that
tomorrow
according
to
the
conditions
according
to
your
will
your
sentiments
which
in
turn
are
controlled
by
an
intellect
that
shows
them
to
you
today
in
one
manner
and
tomorrow
who
knows
how
illusions
of
reality
represented
in
this
fatuous
comedy
of
life
that
never
ends
nor
can
ever
end
because
if
tomorrow
it
were
to
end
then
why
all
would
be
finished
the
manager
oh
for
god
sake
will
you
finish
with
this
philosophizing
and
let
us
try
and
shape
this
comedy
which
you
yourself
have
brought
me
here
you
argue
and
philosophize
a
bit
too
much
my
dear
sir
you
know
you
seem
to
me
almost
almost
and
looks
him
over
from
head
to
ah
by
the
way
i
think
you
introduced
yourself
to
me
as
a
what
shall
we
say
a
character
created
by
an
author
who
did
not
afterward
care
to
make
a
drama
of
his
own
creations
the
father
it
is
the
simple
truth
sir
the
manager
nonsense
cut
that
out
please
none
of
us
believes
it
because
it
is
a
thing
as
you
must
recognize
yourself
which
one
can
believe
seriously
if
you
want
to
know
it
seems
to
me
you
are
trying
to
imitate
the
manner
of
a
certain
author
whom
i
heartily
detest
i
warn
you
although
i
have
unfortunately
bound
myself
to
put
on
one
of
his
works
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
just
starting
to
rehearse
it
when
you
arrived
to
the
and
this
is
what
we
gained
out
of
the
into
the
fire
the
father
i
do
know
to
what
author
you
may
be
alluding
but
believe
me
i
feel
what
i
think
and
i
seem
to
be
philosophizing
only
for
those
who
do
not
think
what
they
feel
because
they
blind
themselves
with
their
own
sentiment
i
know
that
for
many
people
this
seems
much
more
human
but
the
contrary
is
really
true
for
man
never
reasons
so
much
and
becomes
so
introspective
as
when
he
suffers
since
he
is
anxious
to
get
at
the
cause
of
his
sufferings
to
learn
who
has
produced
them
and
whether
it
is
just
or
unjust
that
he
should
have
to
bear
them
on
the
other
hand
when
he
is
happy
he
takes
his
happiness
as
it
comes
and
does
analyse
it
just
as
if
happiness
were
his
right
the
animals
suffer
without
reasoning
about
their
sufferings
but
take
the
case
of
a
man
who
suffers
and
begins
to
reason
about
it
oh
no
it
be
allowed
let
him
suffer
like
an
animal
and
then
ah
yes
he
is
human
the
manager
look
here
look
here
you
off
again
philosophizing
worse
than
ever
the
father
because
i
suffer
sir
i
not
philosophizing
i
crying
aloud
the
reason
of
my
sufferings
the
manager
brusque
movement
as
he
is
taken
with
a
new
i
should
like
to
know
if
anyone
has
ever
heard
of
a
character
who
gets
right
out
of
his
part
and
perorates
and
speechifies
as
you
do
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
case
i
have
the
father
you
have
never
met
such
a
case
sir
because
authors
as
a
rule
hide
the
labour
of
their
creations
when
the
characters
are
really
alive
before
their
author
the
latter
does
nothing
but
follow
them
in
their
action
in
their
words
in
the
situations
which
they
suggest
to
him
and
he
has
to
will
them
the
way
they
will
themselves
for
there
trouble
if
he
does
when
a
character
is
born
he
acquires
at
once
such
an
independence
even
of
his
own
author
that
he
can
be
imagined
by
everybody
even
in
many
other
situations
where
the
author
never
dreamed
of
placing
him
and
so
he
acquires
for
himself
a
meaning
which
the
author
never
thought
of
giving
him
the
manager
yes
yes
i
know
this
the
father
what
is
there
then
to
marvel
at
in
us
imagine
such
a
misfortune
for
characters
as
i
have
described
to
you
to
be
born
of
an
author
fantasy
and
be
denied
life
by
him
and
then
answer
me
if
these
characters
left
alive
and
yet
without
life
were
right
in
doing
what
they
did
do
and
are
doing
now
after
they
have
attempted
everything
in
their
power
to
persuade
him
to
give
them
their
stage
life
we
all
tried
him
in
turn
i
she
the
and
she
the
the
it
true
i
too
have
sought
to
tempt
him
many
many
times
when
he
has
been
sitting
at
his
writing
table
feeling
a
bit
melancholy
at
the
twilight
hour
he
would
sit
in
his
armchair
too
lazy
to
switch
on
the
light
and
all
the
shadows
that
crept
into
his
room
were
full
of
our
presence
coming
to
tempt
him
if
she
saw
herself
still
there
by
the
writing
table
and
was
annoyed
by
the
presence
of
the
oh
if
you
would
only
go
away
go
away
and
leave
us
alone
mother
here
with
that
son
of
hers
i
with
that
child
that
boy
there
always
alone
and
then
i
with
him
hints
at
the
and
then
i
alone
alone
in
those
shadows
a
sudden
movement
as
if
in
the
vision
she
has
of
herself
illuminating
those
shadows
she
wanted
to
seize
hold
of
ah
my
life
my
life
oh
what
scenes
we
proposed
to
him
and
i
tempted
him
more
than
any
of
the
others
the
father
maybe
but
perhaps
it
was
your
fault
that
he
refused
to
give
us
life
because
you
were
too
insistent
too
troublesome
the
nonsense
did
he
make
me
so
himself
close
to
the
manager
to
tell
him
as
if
in
in
my
opinion
he
abandoned
us
in
a
fit
of
depression
of
disgust
for
the
ordinary
theatre
as
the
public
knows
it
and
likes
it
the
son
exactly
what
it
was
sir
exactly
that
the
father
not
at
all
do
believe
it
for
a
minute
listen
to
me
you
be
doing
quite
right
to
modify
as
you
suggest
the
excesses
both
of
this
girl
here
who
wants
to
do
too
much
and
of
this
young
man
who
wo
do
anything
at
all
the
son
no
nothing
the
manager
you
too
get
over
the
mark
occasionally
my
dear
sir
if
i
may
say
so
the
father
i
when
where
the
manager
always
continuously
then
there
this
insistence
of
yours
in
trying
to
make
us
believe
you
are
a
character
and
then
too
you
must
really
argue
and
philosophize
less
you
know
much
less
the
father
well
if
you
want
to
take
away
from
me
the
possibility
of
representing
the
torment
of
my
spirit
which
never
gives
me
peace
you
will
be
suppressing
me
all
every
true
man
sir
who
is
a
little
above
the
level
of
the
beasts
and
plants
does
not
live
for
the
sake
of
living
without
knowing
how
to
live
but
he
lives
so
as
to
give
a
meaning
and
a
value
of
his
own
to
life
for
me
this
is
i
can
not
give
up
this
just
to
represent
a
mere
fact
as
she
the
wants
it
all
very
well
for
her
since
her
vendetta
lies
in
the
fact
i
not
going
to
do
it
it
destroys
my
the
manager
your
oh
we
going
ahead
fine
first
she
starts
off
and
then
you
jump
in
at
this
rate
we
never
finish
the
father
now
do
be
offended
have
it
your
own
way
provided
however
that
within
the
limits
of
the
parts
you
assign
us
each
one
sacrifice
is
too
great
the
manager
you
got
to
understand
that
you
ca
go
on
arguing
at
your
own
pleasure
drama
is
action
sir
action
and
not
confounded
philosophy
the
father
all
right
i
do
just
as
much
arguing
and
philosophizing
as
everybody
does
when
he
is
considering
his
own
torments
the
manager
if
the
drama
permits
but
for
heaven
sake
man
let
get
along
and
come
to
the
scene
the
it
seems
to
me
we
got
too
much
action
with
our
coming
into
his
house
you
said
before
you
could
change
the
scene
every
five
minutes
the
manager
of
course
not
what
we
got
to
do
is
to
combine
and
group
up
all
the
facts
in
one
simultaneous
action
we
ca
have
it
as
you
want
with
your
little
brother
wandering
like
a
ghost
from
room
to
room
hiding
behind
doors
and
meditating
a
project
which
what
did
you
say
it
did
to
him
the
consumes
him
sir
wastes
him
away
the
manager
well
it
may
be
and
then
at
the
same
time
you
want
the
little
girl
there
to
be
playing
in
the
garden
one
in
the
house
and
the
other
in
the
garden
is
that
it
the
yes
in
the
sun
in
the
sun
that
is
my
only
pleasure
to
see
her
happy
and
careless
in
the
garden
after
the
misery
and
squalor
of
the
horrible
room
where
we
all
four
slept
together
and
i
had
to
sleep
with
her
i
do
you
understand
with
my
vile
contaminated
body
next
to
hers
with
her
folding
me
fast
in
her
loving
little
arms
in
the
garden
whenever
she
spied
me
she
would
run
to
take
me
by
the
hand
she
did
care
for
the
big
flowers
only
the
little
ones
and
she
loved
to
show
me
them
and
pet
me
the
manager
well
then
we
have
it
in
the
garden
everything
shall
happen
in
the
garden
and
we
group
the
other
scenes
there
a
stage
here
a
with
trees
and
something
to
do
as
a
fountain
basin
round
to
look
at
the
back
of
the
ah
you
fixed
it
up
good
this
is
just
to
give
an
idea
of
course
the
boy
instead
of
hiding
behind
the
doors
will
wander
about
here
in
the
garden
hiding
behind
the
trees
but
it
going
to
be
rather
difficult
to
find
a
child
to
do
that
scene
with
you
where
she
shows
you
the
flowers
to
the
come
forward
a
little
will
you
please
let
try
it
now
come
along
come
along
seeing
him
come
shyly
forward
full
of
fear
and
looking
it
a
nice
business
this
lad
here
what
the
matter
with
him
we
have
to
give
him
a
word
or
two
to
say
close
to
him
puts
a
hand
on
his
shoulders
and
leads
him
behind
one
of
the
come
on
come
on
let
me
see
you
a
little
hide
here
yes
like
that
try
and
show
your
head
just
a
little
as
if
you
were
looking
for
someone
back
to
observe
the
effect
when
the
boy
at
once
goes
through
the
excellent
fine
to
suppose
the
little
girl
there
were
to
surprise
him
as
he
looks
round
and
run
over
to
him
so
we
could
give
him
a
word
or
two
to
say
the
it
useless
to
hope
he
will
speak
as
long
as
that
fellow
there
is
here
the
you
must
send
him
away
first
the
son
delighted
delighted
i
do
ask
for
anything
better
to
move
the
manager
once
stopping
no
no
where
are
you
going
wait
a
bit
mother
gets
up
alarmed
and
terrified
at
the
thought
that
he
is
really
about
to
go
away
instinctively
she
lifts
her
arms
to
prevent
him
without
however
leaving
her
the
son
manager
who
stops
i
got
nothing
to
do
with
this
affair
let
me
go
please
let
me
go
the
manager
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
you
got
nothing
to
do
with
this
the
with
do
bother
to
stop
him
he
wo
go
away
the
father
he
has
to
act
the
terrible
scene
in
the
garden
with
his
mother
the
son
resolute
and
with
i
shall
act
nothing
at
all
i
said
so
from
the
very
beginning

over
to

allow
me
down
the
manager

which
is
restraining

you
want
to
son
looks
at
her
with
contempt
and
hatred
she
laughs
and
you
see
he
ca
he
ca
go
away
he
is
obliged
to
stay
here
indissolubly
bound
to
the
chain
if
i
who
fly
off
when
that
happens
which
has
to
happen
because
i
ca
bear
him
if
i
am
still
here
and
support
that
face
and
expression
of
his
you
can
well
imagine
that
he
is
unable
to
move
he
has
to
remain
here
has
to
stop
with
that
nice
father
of
his
and
that

whose
only
son
he
is
to
the
come
on

come
along
to

was
getting
up
to
keep
him
back
the
mother
beckoning
her
with
her
come
on
come
on
to
you
can
imagine
how
little
she
wants
to
show
these
actors
of
yours
what
she
really
feels
but
so
eager
is
she
to
get
near
him
that
there
you
see
she
is
willing
to
act
her
part
in
fact
the
mother
approaches
him
and
as
soon
as
the
has
finished
speaking
opens
her
arms
to
signify
that
she
the
son
no
no
if
i
ca
go
away
then
stop
here
but
i
repeat
i
act
nothing
the
father
manager
you
can
force
him
sir
the
son
nobody
can
force
me
the
father
i
can
the
wait
a
minute
wait
first
of
all
the
baby
has
to
go
to
the
fountain
to
take
the
child
and
leads
her
to
the
the
manager
yes
yes
of
course
that
it
both
at
the
same
time
second
lady
lead
and
the
juvenile
lead
at
this
point
separate
themselves
from
the
group
of
actors
one
watches
the
mother
attentively
the
other
moves
about
studying
the
movements
and
manner
of
the
son
whom
he
will
have
to
the
son
what
do
you
mean
by
both
at
the
same
time
it
is
right
there
was
no
scene
between
me
and
her
the
ask
her
how
it
was
the
mother
yes
it
true
i
had
come
into
his
room
the
son
into
my
room
do
you
understand
nothing
to
do
with
the
garden
the
manager
it
does
matter
have
i
told
you
we
got
to
group
the
action
the
son
the
juvenile
lead
studying
what
do
you
want
the
juvenile
lead
nothing
i
was
just
looking
at
you
the
son
towards
the
second
lady
ah
at
it
too
to
her
part
the
the
manager
exactly
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
ought
to
be
grateful
to
them
for
their
interest
the
son
yes
but
have
you
yet
perceived
that
it
possible
to
live
in
front
of
a
mirror
which
not
only
freezes
us
with
the
image
of
ourselves
but
throws
our
likeness
back
at
us
with
a
horrible
grimace
the
father
that
is
true
absolutely
true
you
must
see
that
the
manager
second
lady
lead
and
juvenile
right
move
away
from
them
the
son
do
as
you
like
i
out
of
this

be
quiet

your
mother

were
saying

had
entered
the
mother
yes
into
his
room

i
could
stand
it
any
longer
i
went
to
empty
my
heart
to
him
of
all
the
anguish
that
tortures
me
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
come
in
the
son
nothing
happened
there
was
no
scene
i
went
away
that
all
i
do

for
scenes

but
also
things
that
have
never

then
what
did
happen
you
went
out
of
your
room
without
saying
a
word
the
son
without
a
word
so
as
to
avoid
a
scene
the
manager
and
then
what
did
you
do
the
son
nothing
walking
in
the
garden
for
a
moment
with
expression
of
the
manager
closer
to
him
interested
by
his
extraordinary
well

walking

and
turning
towards

there
in

with
tender

to
the
she
was
following
him

and
then
you
the
son
i
ran
over
to
her
i
was
jumping
in
to
drag
her
out
when
i
saw
something
that
froze
my
blood
the
boy
there
standing
stock
still
with
eyes
like
a
madman
watching
his
little
drowned
sister
in
the
fountain
bends
over
the
fountain
to
hide
the
child
she
then
revolver
shot
rings
out
behind
the
trees
where
the
boy
is
the
mother
a
cry
of
terror
runs
over
in
that
direction
together
with
several
of

at

i
right
then
these

ordulph
we
somewhere
between

and
eleven
hundred
landolph
work
it
out
for
yourself
if
we
are
before
canossa
on
the
of
january
berthold
confused
than
oh
my
god
what
a
mess
i
made
of
it
ordulph
well
just
slightly
if
you
supposed
you
were
at
the
french
court
berthold
all
that
historical
stuff
i
swatted
up
landolph
my
dear
boy
it
four
hundred
years
earlier
berthold
good
heavens
you
ought
to
have
told
me
it
was
germany
and
not
france
i
ca
tell
you
how
many
books
i
read
in
the
last
fifteen
days
harold
but
i
say
surely
you
knew
that
poor
tito
was
adalbert
of
bremen
here
berthold
not
a
damned
bit
landolph
well
do
you
see
how
it
is
when
tito
died
the
marquis
di
nolli
berthold
oh
it
was
he
was
it
he
might
have
told
me
harold
perhaps
he
thought
you
knew
landolph
he
did
want
to
engage
anyone
else
in
substitution
he
thought
the
remaining
three
of
us
would
do
but
began
to
cry
out
with
adalbert
driven
away
because
you
see
he
did
imagine
poor
tito
was
dead
but
that
as
bishop
adalbert
the
rival
bishops
of
cologne
and
mayence
had
driven
him
off
berthold
his
head
in
his
but
i
do
know
a
word
of
what
you
talking
about
ordulph
so
much
the
worse
for
you
my
boy
harold
but
the
trouble
is
that
not
even
we
know
who
you
are
berthold
what
not
even
you
you
do
know
who
supposed
to
be
ordulph
hum
berthold
berthold
but
which
berthold
and
why
berthold
landolph
imitating
henry
they
driven
adalbert
away
from
me
well
then
i
want
berthold
i
want
berthold
that
what
he
said
harold
we
three
looked
one
another
in
the
eyes
who
got
to
be
berthold
ordulph
and
so
here
you
are
berthold
my
dear
fellow
landolph
i
afraid
you
will
make
a
bit
of
a
mess
of
it
berthold
getting
ready
to
ah
no
thanks
very
much
but
i
off
i
out
of
this
harold
him
with
the
other
two
amid
steady
now
do
get
excited
landolph
cheer
up
my
dear
fellow
we
do
any
of
us
know
who
we
are
really
he
harold
he
ordulph
i
landolph
that
the
way
he
calls
us
we
got
used
to
it
but
who
are
we
names
of
the
period
yours
too
is
a
name
of
the
period
berthold
only
one
of
us
poor
tito
had
got
a
really
decent
part
as
you
can
read
in
history
that
of
the
bishop
of
bremen
he
was
just
like
a
real
bishop
tito
did
it
awfully
well
poor
chap
harold
look
at
the
study
he
put
into
it
landolph
why
he
even
ordered
his
majesty
about
opposed
his
views
guided
and
counselled
him
we
secret
counsellors
in
a
manner
of
speaking
only
because
it
is
written
in
history
that
henry
iv
was
hated
by
the
upper
aristocracy
for
surrounding
himself
at
court
with
young
men
of
the
bourgeoise
ordulph
us
that
is
landolph
yes
small
devoted
vassals
a
bit
dissolute
and
very
gay
berthold
so
i
got
to
be
gay
as
well
harold
i
should
say
so
same
as
we
are
ordulph
and
it
is
too
easy
you
know
landolph
it
a
pity
because
the
way
we
got
up
we
could
do
a
fine
historical
reconstruction
there
any
amount
of
material
in
the
story
of
henry
iv
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
do
nothing
we
have
the
form
without
the
content
we
worse
than
the
real
secret
counsellors
of
henry
iv
because
certainly
no
one
had
given
them
a
part
to
play
at
any
rate
they
did
feel
they
had
a
part
to
play
it
was
their
life
they
looked
after
their
own
interests
at
the
expense
of
others
sold
investitures
and
what
not
we
stop
here
in
this
magnificent
court
for
what
just
doing
nothing
we
like
so
many
puppets
hung
on
the
wall
waiting
for
some
one
to
come
and
move
us
or
make
us
talk
harold
ah
no
old
sport
not
quite
that
we
got
to
give
the
proper
answer
you
know
there
trouble
if
he
asks
you
something
and
you
do
chip
in
with
the
cue
landolph
yes
that
true
berthold
do
rub
it
in
too
hard
how
the
devil
am
i
to
give
him
the
proper
answer
if
i
swatted
up
henry
iv
of
france
and
now
he
turns
out
to
be
henry
iv
of
germany
other
three
harold
you
better
start
and
prepare
yourself
at
once
ordulph
we
help
you
out
harold
we
got
any
amount
of
books
on
the
subject
a
brief
run
through
the
main
points
will
do
to
begin
with
ordulph
at
any
rate
you
must
have
got
some
sort
of
general
idea
harold
look
here
him
around
and
shows
him
the
portrait
of
the
marchioness
matilda
on
the
that
berthold
at
that
well
the
thing
seems
to
me
somewhat
out
of
place
anyway
two
modern
paintings
in
the
midst
of
all
this
respectable
antiquity
harold
you
right
they
were
there
in
the
beginning
there
are
two
niches
there
behind
the
pictures
they
were
going
to
put
up
two
statues
in
the
style
of
the
period
then
the
places
were
covered
with
those
canvasses
there
landolph
and
they
would
certainly
be
out
of
place
if
they
really
were
paintings
berthold
what

landolph
go

one
there

himself
as
he
is
in
this
throne
room

all
in
the
style
of
the
period

marvel
at
if

put
you
before
a
mirror
wo
you
see

alive

ancient
costume

mirrors

a
nice
mess
right

john
if
the
gentlemen
would

me
to
speak
they
want
to
come
here
into
the
throne
room
landolph
what
she
the
marchioness
here
harold
then
this
is
something
quite
different
no
this
time
landolph
we
have
a
real
tragedy
that
what
berthold
why
why
ordulph
to
the
she
is
that
person
there
do
you
understand
landolph
the
daughter
is
the
fiancée
of
the
marquis
but
what
have
they
come
for
i
should
like
to
know
ordulph
if
he
sees
her
there
be
trouble
landolph
perhaps
he
wo
recognize
her
any
more
john
you
must
keep
him
there
if
he
should
wake
up
ordulph
easier
said
than
done
by
jove
harold
you
know
what
he
like
john
even
by
force
if
necessary
those
are
my
orders
go
on
go
on
harold
yes
because
who
knows
if
he
has
already
wakened
up
ordulph
come
on
then
landolph
towards
john
with
the
you
tell
us
later
what
it
all
means
john
after
close
the
door
there
and
hide
the
key
that
other
door
too
to
the
other
door
on
john
the
two
be
off
you
two
there
to
exit
close
the
door
after
you
and
hide
the
key
two
valets
go
out
by
the
first
door
on
right
john
moves
over
to
the
left
to
show
in
donna
matilda
spina
the
young
marchioness
frida
dionysius
genoni
the
baron
tito
belcredi
and
the
young
marquis
charles
di
nolli
who
as
master
of
the
house
enters
donna
matilda
spina
handsome
although
there
are
too
patent
signs
of
her
attempts
to
remedy
the
ravages
of
time
with
her
head
is
thus
rather
like
a
walkyrie
this
facial
contrasts
with
her
beautiful
sad
mouth
a
widow
for
many
years
she
now
has
as
her
friend
the
baron
tito
belcredi
whom
neither
she
nor
anyone
else
takes
seriously
at
least
so
it
would
tito
belcredi
is
for
her
at
bottom
he
alone
knows
and
he
is
therefore
entitled
to
laugh
if
his
friend
feels
the
need
of
pretending
not
to
know
he
can
always
laugh
at
the
jests
which
the
beautiful
marchioness
makes
with
the
others
at
his
expense
he
is
slim
prematurely
gray
and
younger
than
she
is
his
head
is
in
shape
he
would
be
a
very
vivacious
person
if
his
ductile
agility
which
among
other
things
makes
him
a
redoubtable
swordsman
were
not
enclosed
in
a
sheath
of
laziness
which
is
revealed
in
his
strange
nasal
frida
daughter
of
the
marchioness
is
sad
because
her
imperious
and
too
beautiful
mother
puts
her
in
the
shade
and
provokes
facile
gossip
against
her
daughter
as
well
as
against
herself
fortunately
for
her
she
is
engaged
to
the
marquis
charles
di
charles
di
nolli
a
stiff
young
man
very
indulgent
towards
others
but
sure
of
himself
for
what
he
amounts
to
in
the
world
he
is
worried
about
all
the
responsibilities
which
he
believes
weigh
on
him
he
is
dressed
in
deep
mourning
for
the
recent
death
of
his
dionysius
genoni
a
bold
rubicund
face
prominent
eyes
a
pointed
beard
which
is
silvery
and
shiny
and
elegant
manners
he
is
nearly
bald
all
enter
in
a
state
of
perturbation
almost
as
if
afraid
and
all
except
di
nolli
looking
curiously
about
the
room
at
first
they
speak
sotto
di
nolli
have
you
given
the
orders
properly
john
yes
my
lord
do
be
anxious
about
that
belcredi
ah
magnificent
magnificent
doctor
how
extremely
interesting
even
in
the
surroundings
his
raving
madness
is
perfectly
taken
into
account
donna
matilda
round
for
her
portrait
discovers
it
and
goes
up
close
to
ah
here
it
is
back
to
admire
it
while
mixed
emotions
stir
within
yes
yes
her
daughter
frida
ah
your
portrait
donna
matilda
no
no
look
again
it
you
not
i
there
di
nolli
yes
it
quite
true
i
told
you
so
i
donna
matilda
but
i
would
never
have
believed
it
as
if
with
a
what
a
strange
feeling
it
gives
one
looking
at
her
frida
what
the
matter
pulls
her
to
her
side
and
slips
an
arm
round
her
come
do
you
see
yourself
in
me
there
frida
well
i
really
donna
matilda
do
you
think
so
do
you
really
to
look
at
it
tito
speak
up
man
belcredi
ah
no
i
sha
look
at
it
for
me
certainly
not
donna
matilda
stupid
you
think
you
are
paying
me
a
compliment
to
doctor
what
do
you
say
doctor
do
say
something
please
doctor
a
movement
to
go
near
to
the
belcredi
his
back
turned
pretending
to
attract
his
attention
hss
no
doctor
for
the
love
of
heaven
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
doctor
bewildered
and
and
why
i
donna
matilda
do
listen
to
him
come
here
insufferable
frida
he
acts
the
fool
by
profession
did
you
know
that
belcredi
the
doctor
seeing
him
go
look
at
your
feet
doctor
mind
where
you
going
doctor
why
belcredi
be
careful
you
do
put
your
foot
in
it
doctor
no
no
after
all
it
seems
to
me
there
no
reason
to
be
astonished
at
the
fact
that
a
daughter
should
resemble
her
mother
belcredi
hullo
hullo
he
done
it
now
he
said
it
donna
matilda
exaggerated
anger
advancing
towards
what
the
matter
what
has
he
said
what
has
he
done
doctor
well
is
it
so
belcredi
the
i
said
there
was
nothing
to
be
astounded
at
and
you
are
astounded
and
why
so
then
if
the
thing
is
so
simple
and
natural
for
you
now
donna
matilda
more
fool
fool
it
just
because
it
is
so
natural
just
because
it
is
my
daughter
who
is
there
to
the
that
is
my
portrait
and
to
find
my
daughter
there
instead
of
me
fills
me
with
astonishment
an
astonishment
which
i
beg
you
to
believe
is
sincere
i
forbid
you
to
cast
doubts
on
it
frida
and
my
god
it
always
like
this
rows
over
nothing
belcredi
slowly
looking
dejected
in
accents
of
i
cast
no
doubt
on
anything
i
noticed
from
the
beginning
that
you
have
shared
your
astonishment
or
if
something
did
astonish
you
it
was
because
the
likeness
between
you
and
the
portrait
seemed
so
strong
donna
matilda
naturally
she
can
not
recognize
herself
in
me
as
i
was
at
her
age
while
i
there
can
very
well
recognize
myself
in
her
as
she
is
now
doctor
quite
right
because
a
portrait
is
always
there
fixed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
for
the
young
lady
something
far
away
and
without
memories
while
for
the
marchioness
it
can
bring
back
everything
movements
gestures
looks
smiles
a
whole
heap
of
things
donna
matilda
exactly
doctor
turning
towards
naturally
enough
you
can
live
all
these
old
sensations
again
in
your
daughter
donna
matilda
he
always
spoils
every
innocent
pleasure
for
me
every
touch
i
have
of
spontaneous
sentiment
he
does
it
merely
to
annoy
me
doctor
at
the
disturbance
he
has
caused
adopts
a
professorial
likeness
dear
baron
is
often
the
result
of
imponderable
things
so
one
explains
that
belcredi
the
somebody
will
soon
be
finding
a
likeness
between
you
and
me
my
dear
professor
di
nolli
oh
let
finish
with
this
please
to
the
two
doors
on
the
right
as
a
warning
that
there
is
someone
there
who
may
be
we
wasted
too
much
time
as
it
is
frida
as
one
might
expect
when
present
to
di
nolli
enough
the
doctor
is
here
and
we
have
come
for
a
very
serious
purpose
which
you
all
know
is
important
for
me
doctor
yes
that
is
so
but
now
first
of
all
let
try
to
get
some
points
down
exactly
excuse
me
marchioness
will
you
tell
me
why
your
portrait
is
here
did
you
present
it
to
him
then
donna
matilda
no
not
at
all
how
could
i
have
given
it
to
him
i
was
just
like
frida
then
and
not
even
engaged
i
gave
it
to
him
three
or
four
years
after
the
accident
i
gave
it
to
him
because
his
mother
wished
it
so
much
to
di
doctor
she
was
his
sister
to
henry
di
nolli
yes
doctor
and
our
coming
here
is
a
debt
we
pay
to
my
mother
who
has
been
dead
for
more
than
a
month
instead
of
being
here
she
and
i
ought
to
be
traveling
together
doctor
taking
a
cure
of
quite
a
different
kind
di
nolli
hum
mother
died
in
the
firm
conviction
that
her
adored
brother
was
just
about
to
be
cured
doctor
and
ca
you
tell
me
if
you
please
how
she
inferred
this
di
nolli
the
conviction
would
appear
to
have
derived
from
certain
strange
remarks
which
he
made
a
little
before
mother
died
doctor
oh
remarks
ah
it
would
be
extremely
useful
for
me
to
have
those
remarks
word
for
word
if
possible
di
nolli
i
ca
remember
them
i
know
that
mother
returned
awfully
upset
from
her
last
visit
with
him
on
her
she
made
me
promise
that
i
would
never
neglect
him
that
i
would
have
doctors
see
him
and
examine
him
doctor
um
um
let
me
see
let
me
see
sometimes
very
small
reasons
determine
and
this
portrait
here
then
donna
matilda
for
heaven
sake
doctor
do
attach
excessive
importance
to
this
it
made
an
impression
on
me
because
i
had
not
seen
it
for
so
many
years
doctor
if
you
please
quietly
quietly
di
nolli
well
yes
it
must
be
about
fifteen
years
ago
donna
matilda
more
more
eighteen
doctor
forgive
me
but
you
do
quite
know
what
i
trying
to
get
at
i
attach
a
very
great
importance
to
these
two
portraits
they
were
painted
naturally
prior
to
the
famous
and
most
regretable
pageant
were
they
donna
matilda
of
course
doctor
that
is
when
he
was
quite
in
his
right
mind
that
what
i
been
trying
to
say
was
it
his
suggestion
that
they
should
be
painted
donna
matilda
lots
of
the
people
who
took
part
in
the
pageant
had
theirs
done
as
a
souvenir
belcredi
i
had
mine
done
as
charles
of
anjou
donna
matilda
as
soon
as
the
costumes
were
ready
belcredi
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
proposed
that
the
whole
lot
of
us
should
be
hung
together
in
a
gallery
of
the
villa
where
the
pageant
took
place
but
in
the
end
everybody
wanted
to
keep
his
own
portrait
donna
matilda
and
i
gave
him
this
portrait
of
me
without
very
much
regret
since
his
mother
di
doctor
you
do
remember
if
it
was
he
who
asked
for
it
donna
matilda
ah
that
i
do
remember
maybe
it
was
his
sister
wanting
to
help
out
doctor
one
other
thing
was
it
his
idea
this
pageant
belcredi
no
no
it
was
mine
doctor
if
you
please
donna
matilda
do
listen
to
him
it
was
poor
idea
belcredi
belassi
what
had
he
got
to
do
with
it
donna
matilda
count
belassi
who
died
poor
fellow
two
or
three
months
after
belcredi
but
if
belassi
was
there
when
di
nolli
excuse
me
doctor
but
is
it
really
necessary
to
establish
whose
the
original
idea
was
doctor
it
would
help
me
certainly
belcredi
i
tell
you
the
idea
was
mine
there
nothing
to
be
proud
of
in
it
seeing
what
the
result
been
look
here
doctor
it
was
like
this
one
evening
in
the
first
days
of
november
i
was
looking
at
an
illustrated
german
review
in
the
club
i
was
merely
glancing
at
the
pictures
because
i
ca
read
german
there
was
a
picture
of
the
kaiser
at
some
university
town
where
he
had
been
a
student
i
remember
which
doctor
bonn
bonn
belcredi
you
are
right
bonn
he
was
on
horseback
dressed
up
in
one
of
those
ancient
german
student
followed
by
a
procession
of
noble
students
also
in
costume
the
picture
gave
me
the
idea
already
some
one
at
the
club
had
spoken
of
a
pageant
for
the
forthcoming
carnival
so
i
had
the
notion
that
each
of
us
should
choose
for
this
tower
of
babel
pageant
to
represent
some
character
a
king
an
emperor
a
prince
with
his
queen
empress
or
lady
alongside
of
him
and
all
on
horseback
the
suggestion
was
at
once
accepted
donna
matilda
i
had
my
invitation
from
belassi
belcredi
well
he
was
speaking
the
truth
that
all
i
can
say
if
he
told
you
the
idea
was
his
he
was
even
at
the
club
the
evening
i
made
the
suggestion
just
as
he
henry
was
there
either
doctor
so
he
chose
the
character
of
henry
donna
matilda
because
i
thinking
of
my
name
and
not
giving
the
choice
any
importance
said
i
would
be
the
marchioness
matilda
of
tuscany
doctor
i
do
understand
the
relation
between
the
two
donna
matilda
neither
did
i
to
begin
with
when
he
said
that
in
that
case
he
would
be
at
my
feet
like
henry
iv
at
canossa
i
had
heard
of
canossa
of
course
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
forgotten
most
of
the
story
and
i
remember
i
received
a
curious
impression
when
i
had
to
get
up
my
part
and
found
that
i
was
the
faithful
and
zealous
friend
of
pope
gregory
vii
in
deadly
enmity
with
the
emperor
of
germany
then
i
understood
why
since
i
had
chosen
to
represent
his
implacable
enemy
he
wanted
to
be
near
me
in
the
pageant
as
henry
iv
doctor
ah
perhaps
because
belcredi
good
heavens
doctor
because
he
was
then
paying
furious
court
to
her
the
and
she
naturally
donna
matilda
naturally
not
naturally
at
all
belcredi
to
she
could
stand
him
donna
matilda
no
that
is
true
i
did
dislike
him
not
at
all
but
for
me
when
a
man
begins
to
want
to
be
taken
seriously
well
belcredi
for
he
gives
you
the
clearest
proof
of
his
stupidity
donna
matilda
no
dear
not
in
this
case
because
he
was
never
a
fool
like
you
belcredi
anyway
i
never
asked
you
to
take
me
seriously
donna
matilda
yes
i
know
but
with
him
one
could
joke
her
tone
and
speaking
to
the
one
of
the
many
misfortunes
which
happen
to
us
women
doctor
is
to
see
before
us
every
now
and
again
a
pair
of
eyes
glaring
at
us
with
a
contained
intense
promise
of
eternal
devotion
out
there
is
nothing
quite
so
funny
if
men
could
only
see
themselves
with
that
eternal
fidelity
look
in
their
faces
i
always
thought
it
comic
then
more
even
than
now
but
i
want
to
make
a
confession
i
can
do
so
after
twenty
years
or
more
when
i
laughed
at
him
then
it
was
partly
out
of
fear
one
might
have
almost
believed
a
promise
from
those
eyes
of
his
but
it
would
have
been
very
dangerous
doctor
lively
ah
ah
this
is
most
interesting
very
dangerous
you
say
donna
matilda
yes
because
he
was
very
different
from
the
others
and
then
i
am
well
what
shall
i
say
a
little
impatient
of
all
that
is
pondered
or
tedious
but
i
was
too
young
then
and
a
woman
i
had
the
bit
between
my
teeth
it
would
have
required
more
courage
than
i
felt
i
possessed
so
i
laughed
at
him
too
with
remorse
to
spite
myself
indeed
since
i
saw
that
my
own
laugh
mingled
with
those
of
all
the
others
the
other
fools
who
made
fun
of
him
belcredi
my
own
case
more
or
less
donna
matilda
you
make
people
laugh
at
you
my
dear
with
your
trick
of
always
humiliating
yourself
it
was
quite
a
different
affair
with
him
there
a
vast
difference
and
you
you
know
people
laugh
in
your
face
belcredi
well
that
better
than
behind
one
back
doctor
let
get
to
the
facts
he
was
then
already
somewhat
exalted
if
i
understand
rightly
belcredi
yes
but
in
a
curious
fashion
doctor
doctor
how
belcredi
well
so
to
speak
donna
matilda
not
at
all
it
was
like
this
doctor
he
was
a
bit
strange
certainly
but
only
because
he
was
fond
of
life
eccentric
there
belcredi
i
do
say
he
simulated
exaltation
on
the
contrary
he
was
often
genuinely
exalted
but
i
could
swear
doctor
that
he
saw
himself
at
once
in
his
own
exaltation
moreover
i
certain
it
made
him
suffer
sometimes
he
had
the
most
comical
fits
of
rage
against
himself
doctor
yes
donna
matilda
that
is
true
belcredi
donna
and
why
the
evidently
because
that
immediate
lucidity
that
comes
from
acting
assuming
a
part
at
once
put
him
out
of
key
with
his
own
feelings
which
seemed
to
him
not
exactly
false
but
like
something
he
was
obliged
to
valorize
there
and
then
as
what
shall
i
say
as
an
act
of
intelligence
to
make
up
for
that
sincere
cordial
warmth
he
felt
lacking
so
he
improvised
exaggerated
let
himself
go
so
as
to
distract
and
forget
himself
he
appeared
inconstant
fatuous
and
yes
even
ridiculous
sometimes
doctor
and
may
we
say
unsociable
belcredi
no
not
at
all
he
was
famous
for
getting
up
things
dances
theatrical
performances
for
charity
all
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
of
course
he
was
a
jolly
good
actor
you
know
di
nolli
madness
has
made
a
superb
actor
of
him
why
so
he
was
even
in
the
old
days
when
the
accident
happened
after
the
horse
fell
doctor
hit
the
back
of
his
head
did
he
donna
matilda
oh
it
was
horrible
he
was
beside
me
i
saw
him
between
the
horse
hoofs
it
was
rearing
belcredi
none
of
us
thought
it
was
anything
serious
at
first
there
was
a
stop
in
the
pageant
a
bit
of
disorder
people
wanted
to
know
what
had
happened
but
they
already
taken
him
off
to
the
villa
donna
matilda
there
was
the
least
sign
of
a
wound
not
a
drop
of
blood
belcredi
we
thought
he
had
merely
fainted
donna
matilda
but
two
hours
afterwards
belcredi
he
reappeared
in
the
of
the
villa
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
say
donna
matilda
my
god
what
a
face
he
had
i
saw
the
whole
thing
at
once
belcredi
no
no
that
is
true
nobody
saw
it
doctor
believe
me
donna
matilda
doubtless
because
you
were
all
like
mad
folk
belcredi
everybody
was
pretending
to
act
his
part
for
a
joke
it
was
a
regular
babel
donna
matilda
and
you
can
imagine
doctor
what
terror
struck
into
us
when
we
understood
that
he
on
the
contrary
was
playing
his
part
in
deadly
earnest
doctor
oh
he
was
there
too
was
he
belcredi
of
course
he
came
straight
into
the
midst
of
us
we
thought
he
quite
recovered
and
was
pretending
fooling
like
all
the
rest
of
us
only
doing
it
rather
better
because
as
i
say
he
knew
how
to
act
donna
matilda
some
of
them
began
to
hit
him
with
their
whips
and
fans
and
sticks
belcredi
and
then
as
a
king
he
was
armed
of
course
he
drew
out
his
sword
and
menaced
two
or
three
of
us
it
was
a
terrible
moment
i
can
assure
you
donna
matilda
i
shall
never
forget
that
scene
all
our
masked
faces
hideous
and
terrified
gazing
at
him
at
that
terrible
mask
of
his
face
which
was
no
longer
a
mask
but
madness
madness
personified
belcredi
he
was
henry
henry
iv
in
person
in
a
moment
of
fury
donna
matilda
he
got
into
it
all
the
detail
and
minute
preparation
of
a
month
careful
study
and
it
all
burned
and
blazed
there
in
the
terrible
obsession
which
lit
his
face
doctor
yes
that
is
quite
natural
of
course
the
momentary
obsession
of
a
dilettante
became
fixed
owing
to
the
fall
and
the
damage
to
the
brain
belcredi
frida
and
di
you
see
the
kind
of
jokes
life
can
play
on
us
di
you
were
four
or
five
years
old
your
mother
imagines
taken
her
place
there
in
that
portrait
when
at
the
time
she
had
not
the
remotest
idea
that
she
would
bring
you
into
the
world
my
hair
is
already
grey
and
he
look
at
him
to
ha
a
smack
on
the
head
and
he
never
moves
again
henry
iv
for
ever
doctor
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
others
looking
learned
and
well
well
then
it
comes
we
may
say
to
this
the
first
exit
to
right
the
one
nearest
footlights
opens
and
berthold
enters
all
berthold
i
say
i
say
for
a
moment
arrested

the
astonishment

his

caused

landolph
my

perhaps
if

once
it
would
turn
his
thoughts
have
the
gentlemen
thought
under
what
pretext
they
will
present
themselves
to

di

it
all
been
arranged
the
if
you
doctor
think
it

to

frida
i
not

i
not
coming
i
keep

you

sir
alas
as
you
see
his
there
be
awful
trouble
if

saw
you
gentlemen

he
would
think
it
was
some
diabolical
masquerade
di
nolli
as
these
men
seem
to
be
in
costume
to
you
so
we
appear
to
be
in
costume
to
him
in
these
modern
clothes
of
ours
landolph
it
would
matter
so
much
if
he
would
suppose
it
to
be
the
work
of
his
mortal
enemy
belcredi
pope
gregory
landolph
precisely
he
calls
him
a
pagan
belcredi
the
pope
a
pagan
not
bad
that
landolph
yes
sir
and
a
man
who
calls
up
the

he
accuses
him
of
all
the
diabolical
arts
he
terribly
afraid
of
him
doctor
persecution
mania
harold
he
be
simply
furious
di
nolli
but
there
no
need
for
you

know
it
sufficient
for
the
doctor
to
see
him
doctor
what
do
you
mean
i
alone
di
but
they
are
there
the
three
young
doctor
i
do
mean
that
i
mean
if
the
marchioness

purpose
i

landolph
excellent
the
mother
of

a
mantle
that

hide
her
other
clothes
entirely

you

harold

this

easily
prepared
disguise
harold
we
made
use
of
it
on
other
occasions
you
see
doctor
but
landolph
oh
no
there
no
risk
of
his
remembering
he
pays
more
attention
to
the
dress

belcredi
well
there
a
fortune
to
go
upon
landolph
we
have
got
there
a
whole
wardrobe
of
costumes
of
the
period
copied
to
perfection
from
old
models
this
is
my
special
job
i
get
them
from
the
best
theatrical
costumers
they
cost
lots
of
money
matilda
wearing
mantle
and
belcredi
once
in
oh
magnificent
oh
truly
regal
donna
matilda
at
belcredi
and
bursting
out
into
oh
no

take
it
off
you
impossible
you
look
like
an
ostrich
dressed
up
as
a
monk
belcredi
well
how
about
the
doctor
the
doctor
i
do
think
i
look
so
bad
do
i
donna
matilda
no
the
doctor
all
right
but
you
are
too
funny
for
words
the
doctor
do
you
have
many
receptions
here
then
landolph
it
depends
he
often
gives
orders
that
such
and
such
a
person
appear
before
him
then
we
have
to
find
someone
who
will
take
the
part
women
too
donna
matilda
but
trying
to
hide
the
ah
women
too
landolph
oh
yes
many
at
first
belcredi
oh
that
great
in
costume
like
the
marchioness
landolph
oh
well
you
know
women
of
the
kind
that
lend
themselves
to
belcredi
ah
i
see
to
the
look
out
you
know
he
becoming
dangerous
for
you
second
door
on
the
right
opens
and
harold
appears
making
first
of
all
a
discreet
sign
that
all
conversation
should
harold
his
majesty
the
emperor
two
valets
enter
first
and
go
and
stand
on
either
side
of
the
throne
then
henry
iv
comes
in
between
ordulph
and
harold
who
keep
a
little
in
the
rear
henry
iv
very
pale
the
hair
on
the
back
of
his
head
is
already
grey
over
the
temples
and
forehead
it
appears
blond
owing
to
its
having
been
tinted
in
an
evident
and
puerile
fashion
on
his
cheek
bones
he
has
two
small
dabs
of
colour
that
stand
out
prominently
against
the
rest
of
his
tragic
pallor
he
is
wearing
a
penitent
sack
over
his
regal
habit
as
at
canossa
his
eyes
have
a
fixed
look
which
is
dreadful
to
see
and
this
expression
is
in
strained
contrast
with
the
sackcloth
ordulph
carries
the
imperial
crown
harold
the
sceptre
with
the
eagle
and
the
globe
with
the
henry
iv
first
to
donna
matilda
and
afterwards
to
the
my
lady
monsignor
he
looks
at
belcredi
and
seems
about
to
greet
him
too
when
suddenly
he
turns
to
landolph
who
has
approached
him
and
asks
him
sotto
voce
and
with
is
that
peter
damiani
landolph
no
sire
he
is
a
monk
from
cluny
who
is
accompanying
the
abbot
henry
iv
again
at
belcredi
with
increasing
mistrust
and
then
noticing
that
he
appears
embarrassed
and
keeps
glancing
at
donna
matilda
and
the
doctor
stands
upright
and
cries
no
it
peter
damiani
it
no
use
father
your
looking
at
the
duchess
turning
quickly
to
donna
matilda
and
the
doctor
as
though
to
ward
off
a
i
swear
it
i
swear
that
my
heart
is
changed
towards
your
daughter
i
confess
that
if
he
had
come
to
forbid
it
in
the
name
of
pope
alexander
i
have
repudiated
her
yes
yes
there
were
people
ready
to
favour
the
repudiation
the
bishop
of
mayence
would
have
done
it
for
a
matter
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
farms
at
landolph
a
little
perplexed
and
but
i
must
speak
ill
of
the
bishops
at
this
moment
humbly
to
i
am
grateful
to
you
believe
me
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
the
hindrance
you
put
in
my
way
god
knows
my
life
been
all
made
of
humiliations
my
mother
adalbert
tribur
goslar
and
now
this
sackcloth
you
see
me
wearing
tone
suddenly
and
speaks
like
one
who
goes
over
his
part
in
a
parenthesis
of
it
does
matter
clarity
of
ideas
perspicacity
firmness
and
patience
under
adversity
the
thing
turning
to
all
and
speaking
i
know
how
to
make
amend
for
the
mistakes
i
have
made
and
i
can
humiliate
myself
even
before
you
peter
damiani
profoundly
to
him
and
remains
curved
then
a
suspicion
is
born
in
him
which
he
is
obliged
to
utter
in
menacing
tones
almost
against
his
was
it
not
perhaps
you
who
started
that
obscene
rumour
that
my
holy
mother
had
illicit
relations
with
the
bishop
of
augusta
belcredi
henry
iv
has
his
finger
pointed
at
no
no
it
was
i
henry
iv
not
true
not
true
infamy
at
him
and
then
i
did
think
you
capable
of
it
to
the
doctor
and
plucks
his
sleeve
while
winking
at
him
always
the
same
monsignor
those
bishops
always
the
same
harold
whispering
as
if
to
help
out
the
yes
yes
the
rapacious
bishops
the
doctor
harold
trying
to
keep
it
ah
yes
those
fellows
ah
yes
henry
iv
nothing
satisfies
them
i
was
a
little
boy
monsignor
one
passes
the
time
playing
even
when
without
knowing
it
one
is
a
i
was
six
years
old
and
they
tore
me
away
from
my
mother
and
made
use
of
me
against
her
without
my
knowing
anything
about
it
always
profaning
always
stealing
stealing
one
greedier
than
the
other
hanno
worse
than
stephen
stephen
worse
than
hanno
landolph
voce
persuasively
to
call
his
majesty
henry
iv
round
ah
yes
this
the
moment
to
speak
ill
of
the
bishops
but
this
infamy
against
my
mother
monsignor
is
too
much
at
the
marchioness
and
grows
and
i
ca
even
weep
for
her
lady
i
appeal
to
you
who
have
a
mother
heart
she
came
here
to
see
me
from
her
convent
a
month
ago
they
had
told
me
she
was
dead
pause
full
of
feeling
then
smiling
i
ca
weep
for
her
because
if
you
are
here
now
and
i
am
like
this
the
sackcloth
he
is
it
means
i
am
years
old
harold
and
that
she
is
therefore
alive
majesty
ordulph
still
in
her
convent
henry
iv
at
ah
yes
and
i
can
postpone
my
grief
to
another
time
the
marchioness
almost
with
coquetery
the
tint
he
has
given
to
his
look
i
am
still
fair
slowly
as
if
in
for
you
there
no
need
but
little
exterior
details
do
help
a
matter
of
time
monsignor
do
you
understand
me
to
the
marchioness
and
notices
her
ah
but
i
see
that
you
too
duchess
italian
eh
much
as
to
say
false
but
without
any
indignation
indeed
rather
with
malicious
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
show
disgust
or
surprise
nobody
cares
to
recognize
that
obscure
and
fatal
power
which
sets
limits
to
pure
will
but
i
say
if
one
is
born
and
one
dies
did
you
want
to
be
born
monsignor
i
did
and
in
both
cases
independently
of
our
wills
so
many
things
happen
we
would
wish
did
happen
and
to
which
we
resign
ourselves
as
best
we
can
doctor
to
make
a
remark
while
studying
henry
iv
alas
yes
alas
henry
iv
it
like
this
when
we
are
not
resigned
out
come
our
desires
a
woman
wants
to
be
a
man
an
old
man
would
be
young
again
desires
ridiculous
fixed
ideas
of
course
but
reflect
monsignor
those
other
desires
are
not
less
ridiculous
i
mean
those
desires
where
the
will
is
kept
within
the
limits
of
the
possible
not
one
of
us
can
lie
or
pretend
we
all
fixed
in
good
faith
in
a
certain
concept
of
ourselves
however
monsignor
while
you
keep
yourself
in
order
holding
on
with
both
your
hands
to
your
holy
habit
there
slips
down
from
your
sleeves
there
peels
off
from
you
like
like
a
serpent
something
you
notice
life
monsignor
to
the
has
it
never
happened
to
you
my
lady
to
find
a
different
self
in
yourself
have
you
always
been
the
same
my
god
one
day
how
was
it
how
was
it
you
were
able
to
commit
this
or
that
action
her
so
intently
in
the
eyes
as
almost
to
make
her
yes
that
particular
action
that
very
one
we
understand
each
other
but
do
be
afraid
i
shall
reveal
it
to
none
and
you
peter
damiani
how
could
you
be
a
friend
of
that
man
landolph
majesty
henry
iv
no
i
wo
name
him
to
what
did
you
think
of
him
but
we
all
of
us
cling
tight
to
our
conceptions
of
ourselves
just
as
he
who
is
growing
old
dyes
his
hair
what
does
it
matter
that
this
dyed
hair
of
mine
is
a
reality
for
you
if
it
to
some
extent
for
me
you
you
my
lady
certainly
do
dye
your
hair
to
deceive
the
others
nor
even
yourself
but
only
to
cheat
your
own
image
a
little
before
the
i
do
it
for
a
joke
you
do
it
seriously
but
i
assure
you
that
you
too
madam
are
in
masquerade
though
it
be
in
all
seriousness
and
i
am
not
speaking
of
the
venerable
crown
on
your
brows
or
the
ducal
mantle
i
am
speaking
only
of
the
memory
you
wish
to
fix
in
yourself
of
your
fair
complexion
one
day
when
it
pleased
you
or
of
your
dark
complexion
if
you
were
dark
the
fading
image
of
your
youth
for
you
peter
damiani
on
the
contrary
the
memory
of
what
you
have
been
of
what
you
have
done
seems
to
you
a
recognition
of
past
realities
that
remain
within
you
like
a
dream
i
in
the
same
case
too
with
so
many
inexplicable
memories
like
dreams
ah
there
nothing
to
marvel
at
in
it
peter
damiani
tomorrow
it
will
be
the
same
thing
with
our
life
of
today
getting
excited
and
taking
hold
of
his
this
sackcloth
here
to
take
it
off
with
a
gesture
of
almost
ferocious
joy
while
the
three
valets
run
over
to
him
frightened
as
if
to
prevent
his
doing
ah
my
god
back
and
throws
off
tomorrow
at
bressanone
german
and
lombard
bishops
will
sign
with
me
the
act
of
deposition
of
gregory
no
pope
at
all
just
a
false
monk
ordulph
the
other
majesty
majesty
in
name
harold
him
to
put
on
the
sackcloth
listen
to
what
he
says
majesty
landolph
monsignor
is
here
with
the
duchess
to
intercede
in
your
favor
secret
signs
to
the
doctor
to
say
something
at
doctor
ah
yes
yes
we
are
here
to
intercede
henry
iv
at
once
almost
terrified
allowing
the
three
to
put
on
the
sackcloth
again
and
pulling
it
down
over
him
with
his
own
pardon
yes
yes
pardon
monsignor
forgive
me
my
lady
i
swear
to
you
i
feel
the
whole
weight
of
the
anathema
himself
takes
his
face
between
his
hands
as
though
waiting
for
something
to
crush
him
then
changing
tone
but
without
moving
says
softly
to
landolph
harold
and
but
i
do
know
why
i
can
not
be
humble
before
that
man
there
landolph
but
why
majesty
do
you
insist
on
believing
he
is
peter
damiani
when
he
is
at
all
henry
iv
at
him
he
is
peter
damiani
harold
no
no
he
is
a
poor
monk
majesty
henry
iv
with
a
touch
of
ah
none
of
us
can
estimate
what
we
do
when
we
do
it
from
instinct
you
perhaps
madam
can
understand
me
better
than
the
others
since
you
are
a
woman
and
a
duchess
this
is
a
solemn
and
decisive
moment
i
could
you
know
accept
the
assistance
of
the
lombard
bishops
arrest
the
pope
lock
him
up
here
in
the
castle
run
to
rome
and
elect
an
offer
alliance
to
robert
guiscard
and
gregory
vii
would
be
lost
i
resist
the
temptation
and
believe
me
i
am
wise
in
doing
so
i
feel
the
atmosphere
of
our
times
and
the
majesty
of
one
who
knows
how
to
be
what
he
ought
to
be
a
pope
do
you
feel
inclined
to
laugh
at
me
seeing
me
like
this
you
would
be
foolish
to
do
so
for
you
do
understand
the
political
wisdom
which
makes
this
penitent
sack
advisable
the
parts
may
be
changed
tomorrow
what
would
you
do
then
would
you
laugh
to
see
the
pope
a
prisoner
no
it
would
come
to
the
same
thing
i
dressed
as
a
penitent
today
he
as
prisoner
tomorrow
but
woe
to
him
who
does
know
how
to
wear
his
mask
be
he
king
or
pope
perhaps
he
is
a
bit
too
cruel
no
yes
yes
maybe
you
remember
my
lady
how
your
daughter
bertha
for
whom
i
repeat
my
feelings
have
changed
to
belcredi
and
shouts
to
his
face
as
if
he
were
being
contradicted
by
yes
changed
on
account
of
the
affection
and
devotion
she
showed
me
in
that
terrible
moment
once
again
to
the
you
remember
how
she
came
with
me
my
lady
followed
me
like
a
beggar
and
passed
two
nights
out
in
the
open
in
the
snow
you
are
her
mother
does
this
touch
your
mother
heart
does
this
urge
you
to
pity
so
that
you
will
beg
his
holiness
for
pardon
beg
him
to
receive
us
donna
matilda
with
feeble
yes
yes
at
once
doctor
it
shall
be
done
henry
iv
and
one
thing
more
them
in
to
listen
to
it
is
enough
that
he
should
receive
me
you
know
he
can
do
i
tell
you
he
can
even
call
up
the
dead
his
behold
me
do
you
see
me
there
is
no
magic
art
unknown
to
him
well
monsignor
my
lady
my
torment
is
really
this
that
whether
here
or
there
to
his
portrait
almost
in
i
ca
free
myself
from
this
magic
i
am
a
penitent
now
you
see
and
i
swear
to
you
i
shall
remain
so
until
he
receives
me
but
you
two
when
the
excommunication
is
taken
off
must
ask
the
pope
to
do
this
thing
he
can
so
easily
do
to
take
me
away
from
that
the
portrait
and
let
me
live
wholly
and
freely
my
miserable
life
a
man
always
be
my
lady
i
ask
this
of
you
for
your
daughter
sake
too
that
i
may
love
her
as
she
deserves
to
be
loved
well
disposed
as
i
am
now
all
tender
towards
her
for
her
pity
there
it
all
there
i
am
in
your
hands
my
lady
monsignor
goes
off
bowing
grandly
through
the
door
by
which
he
entered
leaving
everyone
stupefied
and
the
marchioness
so
profoundly
touched
that
no
sooner
has
he
gone
than
she
breaks
out
into
sobs
and
sits
down
almost
act
ii
room
of
the
villa
adjoining
the
throne
room
its
furniture
is
antique
and
severe
principal
exit
at
rear
in
the
background
to
the
left
two
windows
looking
on
the
garden
to
the
right
a
door
opening
into
the
throne
afternoon
of
the
same
matilda
the
doctor
and
belcredi
are
on
the
stage
engaged
in
conversation
but
donna
matilda
stands
to
one
side
evidently
annoyed
at
what
the
other
two
are
saying
although
she
can
not
help
listening
because
in
her
agitated
state
everything
interests
her
in
spite
of
herself
the
talk
of
the
other
two
attracts
her
attention
because
she
instinctively
feels
the
need
for
calm
at
the
belcredi
it
may
be
as
you
say
doctor
but
that
was
my
impression
doctor
i
wo
contradict
you
but
believe
me
it
is
only
an
impression
belcredi
pardon
me
but
he
even
said
so
and
quite
clearly
to
the
did
he
marchioness
donna
matilda
what
did
he
say
not
oh
yes
but
not
for
the
reason
you
think
doctor
he
was
alluding
to
the
costumes
we
had
slipped
on
your
cloak
the
our
benedictine
habits
but
all
this
is
childish
donna
matilda
quickly
childish
what
do
you
mean
doctor
doctor
from
one
point
of
view
it
is
i
beg
you
to
let
me
say
so
marchioness
yet
on
the
other
hand
it
is
much
more
complicated
than
you
can
imagine
donna
matilda
to
me
on
the
contrary
it
is
perfectly
clear
doctor
a
smile
of
pity
of
the
competent
person
towards
those
who
do
not
we
must
take
into
account
the
peculiar
psychology
of
madmen
which
you
must
know
enables
us
to
be
certain
that
they
observe
things
and
can
for
instance
easily
detect
people
who
are
disguised
can
in
fact
recognize
the
disguise
and
yet
believe
in
it
just
as
children
do
for
whom
disguise
is
both
play
and
reality
that
is
why
i
used
the
word
childish
but
the
thing
is
extremely
complicated
inasmuch
as
he
must
be
perfectly
aware
of
being
an
image
to
himself
and
for
himself
that
image
there
in
fact
to
the
portrait
in
the
throne
room
and
pointing
to
the
belcredi
that
what
he
said
doctor
very
well
then
an
image
before
which
other
images
ours
have
appeared
understand
now
he
in
his
acute
and
perfectly
lucid
delirium
was
able
to
detect
at
once
a
difference
between
his
image
and
ours
that
is
he
saw
that
ours
were
so
he
suspected
us
because
all
madmen
are
armed
with
a
special
diffidence
but
that
all
there
is
to
it
our
built
up
all
round
his
did
not
seem
pitiful
to
him
while
his
seemed
all
the
more
tragic
to
us
in
that
he
as
if
in
defiance
understand
and
induced
by
his
suspicion
wanted
to
show
us
up
merely
as
a
joke
that
was
also
partly
the
case
with
him
in
coming
before
us
with
painted
cheeks
and
hair
and
saying
he
had
done
it
on
purpose
for
a
jest
donna
matilda
no
it
not
that
doctor
it
not
like
that
it
not
like
that
doctor
why
is
it
may
i
ask
donna
matilda
decision
but
i
am
perfectly
certain
he
recognized
me
doctor
it
not
possible
it
not
possible
belcredi
the
same
of
course
not
donna
matilda
than
ever
determined
almost
i
tell
you
he
recognized
me
when
he
came
close
up
to
speak
to
me
looking
in
my
eyes
right
into
my
eyes
he
recognized
me
belcredi
but
he
was
talking
of
your
daughter
donna
matilda
that
not
true
he
was
talking
of
me
of
me
belcredi
yes
perhaps
when
he
said
donna
matilda
herself
about
my
dyed
hair
but
did
you
notice
that
he
added
at
once
or
the
memory
of
your
dark
hair
if
you
were
dark
he
remembered
perfectly
well
that
i
was
dark
then
belcredi
nonsense
nonsense
donna
matilda
listening
to
him
turning
to
the
my
hair
doctor
is
really
dark
like
my
daughter
that
why
he
spoke
of
her
belcredi
but
he
does
even
know
your
daughter
he
never
seen
her
donna
matilda
exactly
oh
you
never
understand
anything
by
my
daughter
stupid
he
meant
me
as
i
was
then
belcredi
oh
this
is
catching
this
is
catching
this
madness
donna
matilda
with
fool
belcredi
excuse
me
were
you
ever
his
wife
your
daughter
is
his
wife
in
his
delirium
bertha
of
susa
donna
matilda
exactly
because
i
no
longer
dark
as
he
remembered
me
but
introduced
myself
as
adelaide
the
mother
my
daughter
does
exist
for
him
he
never
seen
her
you
said
so
yourself
so
how
can
he
know
whether
she
fair
or
dark
belcredi
but
he
said
dark
speaking
generally
just
as
anyone
who
wants
to
recall
whether
fair
or
dark
a
memory
of
youth
in
the
color
of
the
hair
and
you
as
usual
begin
to
imagine
things
doctor
you
said
i
ought
not
to
have
come
it
she
who
ought
not
to
have
come
donna
matilda
for
a
moment
by
belcredi
remark
recovers
herself
then
with
a
touch
of
anger
because
no
no
he
spoke
of
me
he
spoke
all
the
time
to
me
with
me
of
me
belcredi
that
not
bad
he
did
leave
me
a
breathing
space
and
you
say
he
was
talking
all
the
time
to
you
unless
you
think
he
was
alluding
to
you
too
when
he
was
talking
to
peter
damiani
donna
matilda
almost
exceeding
the
limits
of
courteous
who
knows
can
you
tell
me
why
from
the
outset
he
showed
a
strong
dislike
for
you
for
you
alone
the
tone
of
the
question
the
expected
answer
must
almost
explicitly
be
because
he
understands
you
are
my
lover
belcredi
feels
this
so
well
that
he
remains
silent
and
can
say
doctor
the
reason
may
also
be
found
in
the
fact
that
only
the
visit
of
the
duchess
adelaide
and
the
abbot
of
cluny
was
announced
to
him
finding
a
third
person
present
who
had
not
been
announced
at
once
his
suspicions
belcredi
yes
exactly
his
suspicion
made
him
see
an
enemy
in
me
peter
damiani
but
she
got
it
into
her
head
that
he
recognized
her
donna
matilda
there
no
doubt
about
it
i
could
see
it
from
his
eyes
doctor
you
know
there
a
way
of
looking
that
leaves
no
doubt
whatever
perhaps
it
was
only
for
an
instant
but
i
am
sure
doctor
it
is
not
impossible
a
lucid
moment
donna
matilda
yes
perhaps
and
then
his
speech
seemed
to
me
full
of
regret
for
his
and
my
youth
for
the
horrible
thing
that
happened
to
him
that
has
held
him
in
that
disguise
from
which
he
has
never
been
able
to
free
himself
and
from
which
he
longs
to
be
free
he
said
so
himself
belcredi
yes
so
as
to
be
able
to
make
love
to
your
daughter
or
you
as
you
believe
having
been
touched
by
your
pity
donna
matilda
which
is
very
great
i
would
ask
you
to
believe
belcredi
as
one
can
see
marchioness
so
much
so
that
a
might
expect
a
miracle
from
it
doctor
will
you
let
me
speak
i
do
work
miracles
because
i
am
a
doctor
and
not
a
i
listened
very
intently
to
all
he
said
and
i
repeat
that
that
certain
analogical
elasticity
common
to
all
symptomatised
delirium
is
evidently
with
him
much
what
shall
i
say
much
relaxed
the
elements
that
is
of
his
delirium
no
longer
hold
together
it
seems
to
me
he
has
lost
the
equilibrium
of
his
second
personality
and
sudden
recollections
drag
him
and
this
is
very
comforting
not
from
a
state
of
incipient
apathy
but
rather
from
a
morbid
inclination
to
reflective
melancholy
which
shows
a
a
very
considerable
cerebral
activity
very
comforting
i
repeat
now
if
by
this
violent
trick
we
planned
donna
matilda
to
the
window
in
the
tone
of
a
sick
person
but
how
is
it
that
the
motor
has
not
returned
it
three
hours
and
a
half
since
doctor
what
do
you
say
donna
matilda
the
motor
doctor
it
more
than
three
hours
and
a
half
doctor
out
his
watch
and
looking
at
yes
more
than
four
hours
by
this
donna
matilda
it
could
have
reached
here
an
hour
ago
at
least
but
as
usual
belcredi
perhaps
they
ca
find
the
dress
donna
matilda
but
i
explained
exactly
where
it
was
and
frida
where
is
frida
belcredi
out
of
the
perhaps
she
is
in
the
garden
with
charles
doctor
he
talk
her
out
of
her
fright
belcredi
she
not
afraid
doctor
do
you
believe
it
the
thing
bores
her
rather
donna
matilda
just
do
ask
anything
of
her
i
know
what
she
like
doctor
let
wait
patiently
anyhow
it
will
soon
be
over
and
it
has
to
be
in
the
evening
it
will
only
be
the
matter
of
a
moment
if
we
can
succeed
in
rousing
him
as
i
was
saying
and
in
breaking
at
one
go
the
threads
already
slack
which
still
bind
him
to
this
fiction
of
his
giving
him
back
what
he
himself
asks
for
you
remember
he
said
one
can
not
always
be
years
old
madam
if
we
can
give
him
freedom
from
this
torment
which
even
feels
is
a
torment
then
if
he
is
able
to
recover
at
one
bound
the
sensation
of
the
distance
of
time
belcredi
he
be
cured
emphatically
with
we
pull
him
out
of
it
all
doctor
yes
we
may
hope
to
set
him
going
again
like
a
watch
which
has
stopped
at
a
certain
hour
just
as
if
we
had
our
watches
in
our
hands
and
were
waiting
for
that
other
watch
to
go
a
shake
so
and
let
hope
it
tell
the
time
again
after
its
long
stop
this
point
the
marquis
charles
di
nolli
enters
from
the
principal
donna
matilda
oh
charles
and
frida
where
is
she
di
nolli
she
be
here
in
a
moment
doctor
has
the
motor
arrived
di
nolli
yes
donna
matilda
yes
has
the
dress
come
di
nolli
it
been
here
some
time
doctor
good
good
donna
matilda
where
is
she
where
frida
di
nolli
his
shoulders
and
smiling
sadly
like
one
lending
himself
unwillingly
to
an
untimely
you
see
you
see
towards
the
here
she
is
appears
at
the
threshold
of
the
hall
and
announces
with
berthold
her
highness
the
countess
matilda
of
canossa
enters
magnificent
and
beautiful
arrayed
in
the
robes
of
her
mother
as
countess
matilda
of
tuscany
so
that
she
is
a
living
copy
of
the
portrait
in
the
throne
frida
berthold
who
is
bowing
says
to
him
with
of
tuscany
of
tuscany
canossa
is
just
one
of
my
castles
belcredi
look
look
she
seems
another
person
donna
matilda
one
would
say
it
were
i
look
why
frida
look
she
exactly
my
portrait
alive
doctor
yes
yes
perfect
perfect
the
portrait
to
the
life
belcredi
yes
there
no
question
about
it
she
the
portrait
magnificent
frida
do
make
me
laugh
or
i
shall
burst
i
say
mother
what
a
tiny
waist
you
had
i
had
to
squeeze
so
to
get
into
this
donna
matilda
her
dress
a
wait
keep
still
these
pleats
is
it
really
so
tight
frida
i
suffocating
i
implore
you
to
be
quick
doctor
but
we
must
wait
till
it
evening
frida
no
no
i
ca
hold
out
till
evening
donna
matilda
why
did
you
put
it
on
so
soon
frida
the
moment
i
saw
it
the
temptation
was
irresistible
donna
matilda
at
least
you
could
have
called
me
or
have
had
someone
help
you
it
still
all
crumpled
frida
so
i
saw
mother
but
they
are
old
creases
they
wo
come
out
doctor
it
does
matter
marchioness
the
illusion
is
perfect
coming
nearer
and
asking
her
to
come
in
front
of
her
daughter
without
hiding
if
you
please
stay
there
there
at
a
certain
distance
now
a
little
more
forward
belcredi
for
the
feeling
of
the
distance
of
time
donna
matilda
turning
to
twenty
years
after
a
disaster
a
tragedy
belcredi
now
do
let
exaggerate
doctor
trying
to
save
the
no
no
i
meant
the
dress
so
as
to
see
you
know
belcredi
oh
as
for
the
dress
doctor
it
is
a
matter
of
twenty
years
it
eight
hundred
an
abyss
do
you
really
want
to
shove
him
across
it
first
to
frida
and
then
to
from
there
to
here
but
you
have
to
pick
him
up
in
pieces
with
a
basket
just
think
now
for
us
it
is
a
matter
of
twenty
years
a
couple
of
dresses
and
a
masquerade
but
if
as
you
say
doctor
time
has
stopped
for
and
around
him
if
he
lives
there
to
with
her
eight
hundred
years
ago
i
repeat
the
giddiness
of
the
jump
will
be
such
that
finding
himself
suddenly
among
us
doctor
shakes
his
head
in
you
do
think
so
doctor
no
because
life
my
dear
baron
can
take
up
its
rhythms
this
our
life
will
at
once
become
real
also
to
him
and
will
pull
him
up
directly
wresting
from
him
suddenly
the
illusion
and
showing
him
that
the
eight
hundred
years
as
you
say
are
only
twenty
it
will
be
like
one
of
those
tricks
such
as
the
leap
into
space
for
instance
of
the
masonic
rite
which
appears
to
be
heaven
knows
how
far
and
is
only
a
step
down
the
stairs
belcredi
ah
an
idea
yes
look
at
frida
and
the
marchioness
doctor
which
is
more
advanced
in
time
we
old
people
doctor
the
young
ones
think
they
are
more
ahead
but
it
is
true
we
are
more
ahead
because
time
belongs
to
us
more
than
to
them
doctor
if
the
past
did
alienate
us
belcredi
it
does
matter
at
all
how
does
it
alienate
us
they
to
frida
and
di
have
still
to
do
what
we
have
accomplished
doctor
to
grow
old
doing
the
same
foolish
things
more
or
less
as
we
did
this
is
the
illusion
that
one
comes
forward
through
a
door
to
life
it
is
so
as
soon
as
one
is
born
one
starts
dying
therefore
he
who
started
first
is
the
most
advanced
of
all
the
youngest
of
us
is
father
adam
look
there
to
eight
hundred
years
younger
than
all
of
us
the
countess
matilda
of
tuscany
makes
her
a
deep
di
nolli
i
say
tito
do
start
joking
belcredi
oh
you
think
i
am
joking
di
nolli
of
course
of
course
all
the
time
belcredi
impossible
i
even
dressed
up
as
a
benedictine
di
nolli
yes
but
for
a
serious
purpose
belcredi
well
exactly
if
it
has
been
serious
for
the
others
for
frida
now
for
instance
turning
to
the
i
swear
doctor
i
do
yet
understand
what
you
want
to
do
doctor
you
see
let
me
do
as
i
wish
at
present
you
see
the
marchioness
still
dressed
as
belcredi
oh
she
also
has
to
masquerade
doctor
of
course
of
course
in
another
dress
that
in
there
ready
to
be
used
when
it
comes
into
his
head
he
sees
the
countess
matilda
of
canossa
before
him
frida
talking
quietly
to
di
nolli
notices
the
doctor
of
tuscany
of
tuscany
doctor
it
all
the
same
belcredi
oh
i
see
he
be
faced
by
two
of
them
doctor
two
precisely
and
then
frida
him
come
here
doctor
listen
doctor
here
i
am
near
the
two
young
people
and
pretends
to
give
some
explanations
to
belcredi
to
donna
i
say
this
is
getting
rather
strong
you
know
donna
matilda
him
firmly
in
the
what
belcredi
does
it
really
interest
you
as
much
as
all
that
to
make
you
willing
to
take
part
in
for
a
woman
this
is
simply
enormous
donna
matilda
yes
for
an
ordinary
woman
belcredi
oh
no
my
dear
for
all
women
in
a
question
like
this
it
an
abnegation
donna
matilda
i
owe
it
to
him
belcredi
do
lie
you
know
well
enough
it
not
hurting
you
donna
matilda
well
then
where
does
the
abnegation
come
in
belcredi
just
enough
to
prevent
you
losing
caste
in
other
people
eyes
and
just
enough
to
offend
me
donna
matilda
but
who
is
worrying
about
you
now
di
nolli
it
all
right
it
all
right
that
what
we
do
towards
here
you
go
and
call
one
of
those
fellows
berthold
at
once
donna
matilda
but
first
of
all
we
got
to
pretend
that
we
are
going
away
di
nolli
exactly
i
see
to
that
you
do
mind
staying
here
belcredi
oh
no
i
do
mind
i
mind
di
nolli
we
must
look
out
not
to
make
him
suspicious
again
you
know
belcredi
oh
lord
does
amount
to
anything
doctor
he
must
believe
absolutely
that
we
gone
away
followed
by
berthold
enters
from
the
landolph
may
i
come
in
di
nolli
come
in
come
in
i
say
your
name
lolo
it
landolph
lolo
or
landolph
just
as
you
like
di
nolli
well
look
here
the
doctor
and
the
marchioness
are
leaving
at
once
landolph
very
well
all
we
got
to
say
is
that
they
have
been
able
to
obtain
the
permission
for
the
reception
from
his
holiness
he
in
there
in
his
own
apartments
repenting
of
all
he
said
and
in
an
awful
state
to
have
the
pardon
would
you
mind
coming
a
minute
if
you
would
just
for
a
minute
put
on
the
dress
again
doctor
why
of
course
with
pleasure
landolph
might
i
be
allowed
to
make
a
suggestion
why
not
add
that
the
marchioness
of
tuscany
has
interceded
with
the
pope
that
he
should
be
received
donna
matilda
you
see
he
has
recognized
me
landolph
forgive
me
i
do
know
my
history
very
well
i
am
sure
you
gentlemen
know
it
much
better
but
i
thought
it
was
believed
that
henry
iv
had
a
secret
passion
for
the
marchioness
of
tuscany
donna
matilda
nothing
of
the
kind
nothing
of
the
kind
landolph
that
what
i
thought
but
he
says
he
loved
her
he
always
saying
it
and
now
he
fears
that
her
indignation
for
this
secret
love
of
his
will
work
him
harm
with
the
pope
belcredi
we
must
let
him
understand
that
this
aversion
no
longer
exists
landolph
exactly
of
course
donna
matilda
history
says
i
do
know
whether
you
know
it
or
not
that
the
pope
gave
way
to
the
supplications
of
the
marchioness
matilda
and
the
abbot
of
cluny
and
i
may
say
my
dear
belcredi
that
i
intended
to
take
advantage
of
this
fact
at
the
time
of
the
pageant
to
show
him
my
feelings
were
not
so
hostile
to
him
as
he
supposed
belcredi
you
are
most
faithful
to
history
marchioness
landolph
well
then
the
marchioness
could
spare
herself
a
double
disguise
and
present
herself
with
monsignor
the
as
the
marchioness
of
tuscany
doctor
no
no
that
wo
do
at
all
it
would
ruin
everything
the
impression
from
the
confrontation
must
be
a
sudden
one
give
a
shock
no
no
marchioness
you
will
appear
again
as
the
duchess
adelaide
the
mother
of
the
empress
and
then
we
go
away
this
is
most
necessary
that
he
should
know
we
gone
away
come
on
do
let
waste
any
more
time
there
a
lot
to
prepare
the
doctor
donna
matilda
and
landolph
frida
i
am
beginning
to
feel
afraid
again
di
nolli
again
frida
frida
it
would
have
been
better
if
i
had
seen
him
before
di
nolli
there
nothing
to
be
frightened
of
really
frida
he
is
furious
is
he
di
nolli
of
course
not
he
quite
calm
belcredi
ironic
sentimental
melancholy
did
you
hear
that
he
loves
you
frida
thanks
that
just
why
i
am
afraid
belcredi
he
wo
do
you
any
harm
di
nolli
it
only
last
a
minute
frida
yes
but
there
in
the
dark
with
him
di
nolli
only
for
a
moment
and
i
will
be
near
you
and
all
the
others
behind
the
door
ready
to
run
in
as
soon
as
you
see
your
mother
your
part
will
be
finished
belcredi
i
afraid
of
a
different
thing
that
wasting
our
time
di
nolli
do
begin
again
the
remedy
seems
a
sound
one
to
me
frida
i
think
so
too
i
feel
it
i
all
trembling
belcredi
but
mad
people
my
dear
friends
though
they
do
know
it
alas
have
this
felicity
which
we
do
take
into
account
di
nolli
what
felicity
nonsense
belcredi
they
do
reason
di
nolli
what
reasoning
got
to
do
with
it
anyway
belcredi
do
you
call
it
reasoning
that
he
will
have
to
do
according
to
us
when
he
sees
her
and
her
mother
we
reasoned
it
all
out
surely
di
nolli
nothing
of
the
kind
no
reasoning
at
all
we
put
before
him
a
double
image
of
his
own
fantasy
or
fiction
as
the
doctor
says
belcredi
i
say
i
never
understood
why
they
take
degrees
in
medicine
di
nolli
who
belcredi
the
alienists
di
nolli
what
ought
they
to
take
degrees
in
then
frida
if
they
are
alienists
in
what
else
should
they
take
degrees
belcredi
in
law
of
course
all
a
matter
of
talk
the
more
they
talk
the
more
highly
they
are
considered
analogous
elasticity
the
sensation
of
distance
in
time
and
the
first
thing
they
tell
you
is
that
they
do
work
miracles
when
a
miracle
just
what
is
wanted
but
they
know
that
the
more
they
say
they
are
not
the
more
folk
believe
in
their
seriousness
berthold
has
been
looking
through
the
keyhole
of
the
door
on
there
they
are
there
they
are
coming
in
here
di
nolli
are
they
berthold
he
wants
to
come
with
them
yes
he
coming
too
di
nolli
let
get
away
then
let
get
away
at
once
you
stop
here
berthold
must
i
answering
him
di
nolli
frida
and
belcredi
go
out
by
the
main
exit
leaving
berthold
surprised
the
door
on
the
right
opens
and
landolph
enters
first
bowing
then
donna
matilda
comes
in
with
mantle
and
ducal
crown
as
in
the
first
act
also
the
doctor
as
the
abbot
of
cluny
henry
iv
is
among
them
in
royal
dress
ordulph
and
harold
enter
last
of
henry
iv
up
what
he
has
been
saying
in
the
other
and
now
i
will
ask
you
a
question
how
can
i
be
astute
if
you
think
me
obstinate
doctor
no
no
not
obstinate
henry
iv
then
you
think
me
really
astute
doctor
no
no
neither
obstinate
nor
astute
henry
iv
benevolent
monsignor
if
obstinacy
is
not
a
vice
which
can
go
with
astuteness
i
hoped
that
in
denying
me
the
former
you
would
at
least
allow
me
a
little
of
the
latter
i
can
assure
you
i
have
great
need
of
it
but
if
you
want
to
keep
it
all
for
yourself
doctor
i
i
do
i
seem
astute
to
you
henry
iv
no
monsignor
what
do
you
say
not
in
the
least
perhaps
in
this
case
i
may
seem
a
little
obstinate
to
you
short
to
speak
to
donna
with
your
permission
a
word
in
confidence
to
the
duchess
her
aside
and
asks
her
very
is
your
daughter
really
dear
to
you
donna
matilda
why
yes
certainly
henry
iv
do
you
wish
me
to
compensate
her
with
all
my
love
with
all
my
devotion
for
the
grave
wrongs
i
have
done
her
though
you
must
not
believe
all
the
stories
my
enemies
tell
about
my
dissoluteness
donna
matilda
no
no
i
do
believe
them
i
never
have
believed
such
stories
henry
iv
well
then
are
you
willing
donna
matilda
what
henry
iv
that
i
return
to
love
your
daughter
again
at
her
and
adds
in
a
mysterious
tone
of
you
must
be
a
friend
of
the
marchioness
of
tuscany
donna
matilda
i
tell
you
again
that
she
has
begged
and
tried
not
less
than
ourselves
to
obtain
your
pardon
henry
iv
but
do
tell
me
that
do
say
that
to
me
do
you
see
the
effect
it
has
on
me
my
lady
donna
matilda
at
him
then
very
softly
as
if
in
you
love
her
still
henry
iv
still
still
you
say
you
know
then
but
nobody
knows
nobody
must
know
donna
matilda
but
perhaps
she
knows
if
she
has
begged
so
hard
for
you
henry
iv
at
her
and
and
you
love
your
daughter
pause
he
turns
to
the
doctor
with
laughing
ah
monsignor
it
strange
how
little
i
think
of
my
wife
it
may
be
a
sin
but
i
swear
to
you
that
i
hardly
feel
her
at
all
in
my
heart
what
is
stranger
is
that
her
own
mother
scarcely
feels
her
in
her
heart
confess
my
lady
that
she
amounts
to
very
little
for
you
to
she
talks
to
me
of
that
other
woman
insistently
insistently
i
do
know
why
landolph
maybe
majesty
it
is
to
disabuse
you
of
some
ideas
you
have
had
about
the
marchioness
of
tuscany
dismayed
at
having
allowed
himself
this
observation
i
mean
just
now
of
course
henry
iv
you
too
maintain
that
she
has
been
friendly
to
me
landolph
yes
at
the
moment
majesty
donna
matilda
exactly
exactly
henry
iv
i
understand
that
is
to
say
you
do
believe
i
love
her
i
see
i
see
nobody
ever
believed
it
ever
thought
it
better
so
then
but
enough
enough
to
the
doctor
with
changed
monsignor
you
see
the
reasons
the
pope
has
had
for
revoking
the
excommunication
have
got
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
reasons
for
which
he
excommunicated
me
originally
tell
pope
gregory
we
shall
meet
again
at
brixen
and
you
madame
should
you
chance
to
meet
your
daughter
in
the
courtyard
of
the
castle
of
your
friend
the
marchioness
ask
her
to
visit
me
we
shall
see
if
i
succeed
in
keeping
her
close
beside
me
as
wife
and
empress
many
women
have
presented
themselves
here
already
assuring
me
that
they
were
she
but
they
all
even
while
they
told
me
they
came
from
susa
i
do
know
why
began
to
laugh
and
then
in
the
bedroom
well
a
man
is
a
man
and
a
woman
is
a
woman
undressed
we
do
bother
much
about
who
we
are
and
one
dress
is
like
a
phantom
that
hovers
always
near
one
oh
monsignor
phantoms
in
general
are
nothing
more
than
trifling
disorders
of
the
spirit
images
we
can
not
contain
within
the
bounds
of
sleep
they
reveal
themselves
even
when
we
are
awake
and
they
frighten
us
i
ah
i
am
always
afraid
when
at
night
time
i
see
disordered
images
before
me
sometimes
i
am
even
afraid
of
my
own
blood
pulsing
loudly
in
my
arteries
in
the
silence
of
night
like
the
sound
of
a
distant
step
in
a
lonely
corridor
but
forgive
me
i
have
kept
you
standing
too
long
already
i
thank
you
my
lady
i
thank
you
monsignor
matilda
and
the
doctor
go
off
bowing
as
soon
as
they
have
gone
henry
iv
suddenly
changes
his
buffoons
buffoons
one
can
play
any
tune
on
them
and
that
other
fellow
pietro
damiani
caught
him
out
perfectly
he
afraid
to
appear
before
me
again
up
and
down
excitedly
while
saying
this
then
sees
berthold
and
points
him
out
to
the
other
three
oh
look
at
this
imbecile
watching
me
with
his
mouth
wide
open
do
you
understand
you
see
idiot
how
i
treat
them
how
i
play
the
fool
with
them
make
them
appear
before
me
just
as
i
wish
miserable
frightened
clowns
that
they
are
and
you
the
are
amazed
that
i
tear
off
their
ridiculous
masks
now
just
as
if
it
was
i
who
had
made
them
mask
themselves
to
satisfy
this
taste
of
mine
for
playing
the
madman
landolph
harold
ordulph
looking
at
one
what
what
does
he
say
what
henry
iv
them
enough
enough
let
stop
it
i
tired
of
it
as
if
the
thought
left
him
no
by
god
the
impudence
to
come
here
along
with
her
lover
and
pretending
to
do
it
out
of
pity
so
as
not
to
infuriate
a
poor
devil
already
out
of
the
world
out
of
time
out
of
life
if
it
had
been
supposed
to
be
done
out
of
pity
one
can
well
imagine
that
fellow
would
have
allowed
it
those
people
expect
others
to
behave
as
they
wish
all
the
time
and
of
course
nothing
arrogant
in
that
oh
no
oh
no
it
merely
their
way
of
thinking
of
feeling
of
seeing
everybody
has
his
own
way
of
thinking
you
fellows
too
yours
is
that
of
a
flock
of
sheep
miserable
feeble
uncertain
but
those
others
take
advantage
of
this
and
make
you
accept
their
way
of
thinking
or
at
least
they
suppose
they
do
because
after
all
what
do
they
succeed
in
imposing
on
you
words
words
which
anyone
can
interpret
in
his
own
manner
the
way
public
opinion
is
formed
and
it
a
bad
look
out
for
a
man
who
finds
himself
labelled
one
day
with
one
of
these
words
which
everyone
repeats
for
example
madman
or
imbecile
do
you
think
is
rather
hard
for
a
man
to
keep
quiet
when
he
knows
that
there
is
a
fellow
going
about
trying
to
persuade
everybody
that
he
is
as
he
sees
him
than
to
fix
him
in
other
people
opinion
as
a
madman
according
to
him
now
i
am
talking
seriously
before
i
hurt
my
head
falling
from
my
horse
suddenly
noticing
the
dismay
of
the
four
young
what
the
matter
with
you
their
amazed
what
am
i
or
am
i
not
mad
oh
yes
i
mad
all
right
becomes
well
then
by
god
down
on
your
knees
down
on
your
knees
them
go
down
on
their
knees
one
by
i
order
you
to
go
down
on
your
knees
before
me
and
touch
the
ground
three
times
with
your
foreheads
down
down
that
the
way
you
got
to
be
before
madmen
annoyed
with
their
facile
get
up
sheep
you
obeyed
me
did
you
you
might
have
put
the
straight
jacket
on
me
crush
a
man
with
the
weight
of
a
word
it
nothing
a
fly
all
our
life
is
crushed
by
the
weigh
of
words
the
weight
of
the
dead
look
at
me
here
can
you
really
suppose
that
henry
iv
is
still
alive
all
the
same
i
speak
and
order
you
live
men
about
do
you
think
it
a
joke
that
the
dead
continue
to
live
yes
it
a
joke
but
get
out
into
the
live
world
ah
you
say
what
a
beautiful
sunrise
for
us
all
time
is
before
us
dawn
we
will
do
what
we
like
with
this
day
ah
yes
to
tell
with
tradition
the
old
conventions
well
go
on
you
will
do
nothing
but
repeat
the
old
old
words
while
you
imagine
you
are
living
up
to
berthold
who
has
now
become
quite
you
understand
a
word
of
this
do
you
what
your
name

berthold
henry
iv
poor
berthold

your
name

my
name

fino
henry
iv
the
warning
and
critical
glances
of
the
others
turns
to
them
to
reduce
them
to
fino
berthold
fino
pagliuca
sire
henry
iv
to
i
heard
you
call
each
other
by
your
often
enough
your
name
is
lolo
is
it
landolph
yes
sire
with
a
sense
of
immense
oh
lord
oh
lord
then

is
not
mad
henry
iv
what
landolph

i
said
henry

a
jolly
good
laugh
ah
ah
ah
landolph
harold
ordulph
at
each
other
half
happy
and
half
then
he
cured
he
all
right
henry
iv
silence
silence
why
you
laugh
are
you
offended
i
did
mean
it
especially
for
you
it
convenient
for
everybody
to
insist
that
certain
people
are
mad
so
they
can
be
shut
up
do
you
know
why
because
it
impossible
to
hear
them
speak
what
shall
i
say
of
these
people
who
just
gone
away
that
one
is
a
whore
another
a
libertine
another
a
swindler
do
you
think
so
you
ca
believe
a
word
he
says
do
you
think
so
by
the
way
they
all
listen
to
me
terrified
and
why
are
they
terrified
if
what
i
say
is
true
of
course
you
ca
believe
what
madmen
say
yet
at
the
same
time
they
stand
there
with
their
eyes
wide
open
with
terror
why
tell
me
tell
me
why
you
see
i
quite
calm
now
berthold
but
perhaps
they
think
that
henry
iv
no
no
my
dear
fellow
look
me
well
in
the
eyes
i
do
say
that
it
true
nothing
is
true
berthold
but
look
me
in
the
eyes
berthold
well
henry
iv
you
see
you
see
you
have
terror
in
your
own
eyes
now
because
i
seem
mad
to
you
there
the
proof
of
it
landolph
forward
in
the
name
of
the
others
what
proof
henry
iv
your
being
so
dismayed
because
now
i
seem
again
mad
to
you
you
have
thought
me
mad
up
to
now
have
you
you
feel
that
this
dismay
of
yours
can
become
terror
too
something
to
dash
away
the
ground
from
under
your
feet
and
deprive
you
of
the
air
you
breathe
do
you
know
what
it
means
to
find
yourselves
face
to
face
with
a
madman
with
one
who
shakes
the
foundations
of
all
you
have
built
up
in
yourselves
your
logic
the
logic
of
all
your
constructions
madmen
lucky
folk
construct
without
logic
or
rather
with
a
logic
that
flies
like
a
feather
voluble
voluble
today
like
this
and
tomorrow
who
knows
you
say
this
can
not
be
but
for
them
everything
can
be
you
say
this
true
and
why
because
it
does
seem
true
to
you
or
you
or
you
the
three
of
them
in
and
to
a
hundred
thousand
others
one
must
see
what
seems
true
to
these
hundred
thousand
others
who
are
not
supposed
to
be
mad
what
a
magnificent
spectacle
they
afford
when
they
reason
what
flowers
of
logic
they
scatter
i
know
that
when
i
was
a
child
i
thought
the
moon
in
the
pond
was
real
how
many
things
i
thought
real
i
believed
everything
i
was
told
and
i
was
happy
because
it
a
terrible
thing
if
you
do
hold
on
to
that
which
seems
true
to
you
today
to
that
which
will
seem
true
to
you
tomorrow
even
if
it
is
the
opposite
of
that
which
seemed
true
to
you
yesterday
i
would
never
wish
you
to
think
as
i
have
done
on
this
horrible
thing
which
really
drives
one
mad
that
if
you
were
beside
another
and
looking
into
his
eyes
as
i
one
day
looked
into
somebody
eyes
you
might
as
well
be
a
beggar
before
a
door
never
to
be
opened
to
you
for
he
who
does
enter
there
will
never
be
you
but
someone
unknown
to
you
with
his
own
indifferent
and
impenetrable
world
pause
darkness
gathers
in
the
room
increasing
the
sense
of
strangeness
and
consternation
in
which
the
four
young
men
are
involved
henry
iv
remains
aloof
pondering
on
the
misery
which
is
not
only
his
but
everybody
then
he
pulls
himself
up
and
says
in
an
ordinary
it
getting
dark
here
ordulph
shall
i
go
for
a
lamp
henry
iv
the
lamp
yes
the
lamp
do
you
suppose
i
do
know
that
as
soon
as
i
turn
my
back
with
my
oil
lamp
to
go
to
bed
you
turn
on
the
electric
light
for
yourselves
here
and
even
there
in
the
throne
room
i
pretend
not
to
see
it
ordulph
well
then
shall
i
turn
it
on
now
henry
iv
no
it
would
blind
me
i
want
my
lamp
ordulph
it
ready
here
behind
the
door
to
the
main
exit
opens
the
door
goes
out
for
a
moment
and
returns
with
an
ancient
lamp
which
is
held
by
a
ring
at
the
henry
iv
ah
a
little
light
sit
there
around
the
table
no
not
like
that
in
an
elegant
easy
manner
yes
you
like
that
poses
him
to
you
so
and
i
here
opposite
we
could
do
with
a
little
decorative
moonlight
it
very
useful
for
us
the
moonlight
i
feel
a
real
necessity
for
it
and
pass
a
lot
of
time
looking
up
at
the
moon
from
my
window
who
would
think
to
look
at
her
that
she
knows
that
eight
hundred
years
have
passed
and
that
i
seated
at
the
window
can
not
really
be
henry
iv
gazing
at
the
moon
like
any
poor
devil
but
look
look
see
what
a
magnificent
night
scene
we
have
here
the
emperor
surrounded
by
his
faithful
counsellors
how
do
you
like
it
landolph
to
harold
so
as
not
to
break
the
and
to
think
it
was
true
henry
iv
true
what
was
true
landolph
as
if
to
excuse
no
i
mean
i
was
saying
this
morning
to
him
he
has
just
entered
on
service
here
i
was
saying
what
a
pity
that
dressed
like
this
and
with
so
many
beautiful
costumes
in
the
wardrobe
and
with
a
room
like
that
the
throne
henry
iv
well
what
the
pity
landolph
well
that
we
did
know
henry
iv
that
it
was
all
done
in
jest
this
comedy
landolph
because
we
thought
that
harold
to
his
yes
that
it
was
done
seriously
henry
iv
what
do
you
say
does
it
seem
serious
to
you
landolph
but
if
you
say
that
henry
iv
i
say
that
you
are
fools
you
ought
to
have
known
how
to
create
a
fantasy
for
yourselves
not
to
act
it
for
me
or
anyone
coming
to
see
me
but
naturally
simply
day
by
day
before
nobody
feeling
yourselves
alive
in
the
history
of
the
eleventh
century
here
at
the
court
of
your
emperor
henry
you
ordulph
him
by
the
alive
in
the
castle
of
goslar
waking
up
in
the
morning
getting
out
of
bed
and
entering
straightway
into
the
dream
clothing
yourself
in
the
dream
that
would
be
no
more
a
dream
because
you
would
have
lived
it
felt
it
all
alive
in
you
you
would
have
drunk
it
in
with
the
air
you
breathed
yet
knowing
all
the
time
that
it
was
a
dream
so
you
could
better
enjoy
the
privilege
afforded
you
of
having
to
do
nothing
else
but
live
this
dream
this
far
off
and
yet
actual
dream
and
to
think
that
at
a
distance
of
eight
centuries
from
this
remote
age
of
ours
so
coloured
and
so
sepulchral
the
men
of
the
twentieth
century
are
torturing
themselves
in
ceaseless
anxiety
to
know
how
their
fates
and
fortunes
will
work
out
whereas
you
are
already
in
history
with
me
landolph
yes
yes
very
good
henry
iv
everything
determined
everything
settled
ordulph
yes
yes
henry
iv
and
sad
as
is
my
lot
hideous
as
some
of
the
events
are
bitter
the
struggles
and
troublous
the
time
still
all
history
all
history
that
can
not
change
understand
all
fixed
forever
and
you
could
have
admired
at
your
ease
how
every
effect
followed
obediently
its
cause
with
perfect
logic
how
every
event
took
place
precisely
and
coherently
in
each
minute
particular
the
pleasure
the
pleasure
of
history
in
fact
which
is
so
great
was
yours
landolph
beautiful
beautiful
henry
iv
beautiful
but
it
finished
now
that
you
know
i
could
not
do
it
any
more
his
lamp
to
go
to
neither
could
you
if
up
to
now
you
have
understood
the
reason
of
it
i
am
sick
of
it
now
to
himself
with
violent
contained
by
god
i
make
her
sorry
she
came
here
dressed
herself
up
as
a
for
me
and
he
as
an
abbot
and
they
bring
a
doctor
with
them
to
study
me
who
knows
if
they
do
hope
to
cure
me
clowns
i
like
to
smack
one
of
them
at
least
in
the
face
yes
that
one
a
famous
swordsman
they
say
kill
me
well
we
see
we
see
knock
at
the
who
is
it
the
voice
of
john
deo
gratias
harold
pleased
at
the
chance
for
another
oh
it
john
it
old
john
who
comes
every
night
to
play
the
monk
ordulph
his
yes
yes
let
make
him
do
it
henry
iv
once
fool
why
just
to
play
a
joke
on
a
poor
old
man
who
does
it
for
love
of
me
landolph
it
has
to
be
as
if
it
were
true
henry
iv
exactly
as
if
true
because
only
so
truth
is
not
a
jest

and
admits
john
dressed
as
a
humble
friar
with
a
roll
of
parchment
under
his
come
in
come
in
father
assuming
a
tone
of
tragic
gravity
and
deep
all
the
documents
of
my
life
and
reign
favorable
to
me
were
destroyed
deliberately
by
my
enemies
one
only
has
escaped
destruction
this
my
life
written
by
a
humble
monk
who
is
devoted
to
me
and
you
would
laugh
at
him
affectionately
to
john
and
invites
him
to
sit
down
at
the
sit
down
father
sit
down
have
the

prepares
to

your
majesty
henry

proclaimed
at

the
poor
and
humble

it

to

hunger
and
misery
to

act
iii
throne
room
so
dark
that
the
wall
at
the
bottom
is
hardly
seen
the
canvasses
of
the
two
portraits
have
been
taken
away
and
within
their
frames
frida
dressed
as
the
marchioness
of
tuscany
and
charles
di
nolli
as
henry
iv
have
taken
the
exact
positions
of
the
a
moment
after
the
raising
of
curtain
the
stage
is
empty
then
the
door
on
the
left
opens
and
henry
holding
the
lamp
by
the
ring
on
top
of
it
enters
he
looks
back
to
speak
to
the
four
young
men
who
with
john
are
presumedly
in
the
adjoining
hall
as
at
the
end
of
the
second
henry
iv
no
stay
where
you
are
stay
where
you
are
i
shall
manage
all
right
by
myself
good
night
the
door
and
walks
very
sad
and
tired
across
the
hall
towards
the
second
door
on
the
right
which
leads
into
his
frida
soon
as
she
sees
that
he
has
just
passed
the
throne
whispers
from
the
niche
like
one
who
is
on
the
point
of
fainting
away
with
henry
henry
iv
at
the
voice
as
if
someone
had
stabbed
him
traitorously
in
the
back
turns
a
face
towards
the
wall
at
the
bottom
of
the
room
raising
an
arm
instinctively
as
if
to
defend
himself
and
ward
off
a
who
is
calling
me
is
not
a
question
but
an
exclamation
vibrating
with
terror
which
does
not
expect
a
reply
from
the
darkness
and
the
terrible
silence
of
the
hall
which
suddenly
fills
him
with
the
suspicion
that
he
is
really
frida
his
shudder
of
terror
is
herself
not
less
frightened
at
the
part
she
is
playing
and
repeats
a
little
more
henry
although
she
wishes
to
act
the
part
as
they
have
given
it
to
her
she
stretches
her
head
a
little
out
of
the
frame
towards
the
other
henry
iv
a
dreadful
cry
lets
the
lamp
fall
from
his
hands
to
cover
his
head
with
his
arms
and
makes
a
movement
as
if
to
run
frida
from
the
frame
on
to
the
stand
and
shouting
like
a
mad
henry
henry
i
afraid
terrified
while
di
nolli
jumps
in
turn
on
to
the
stand
and
thence
to
the
floor
and
runs
to
frida
who
on
the
verge
of
fainting
continues
to
cry
out
the
doctor
donna
matilda
also
dressed
as
matilda
of
tuscany
tito
belcredi
landolph
berthold
and
john
enter
the
hall
from
the
doors
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
one
of
them
turns
on
the
light
a
strange
light
coming
from
lamps
hidden
in
the
ceiling
so
that
only
the
upper
part
of
the
stage
is
well
lighted
the
others
without
taking
notice
of
henry
who
looks
on
astonished
by
the
unexpected
inrush
after
the
moment
of
terror
which
still
causes
him
to
tremble
run
anxiously
to
support
and
comfort
the
still
shaking
frida
who
is
moaning
in
the
arms
of
her
fiance
all
are
speaking
at
the
same
di
nolli
no
no
frida
here
i
am
i
am
beside
you
doctor
with
the
enough
enough
nothing
more
to
be
done
donna
matilda
he
is
cured
frida
look
he
is
cured
you
see
di
nolli
cured
belcredi
it
was
only
for
fun
be
calm
frida
no
i
am
afraid
i
am
afraid
donna
matilda
afraid
of
what
look
at
him
he
was
never
mad
at
all
di
nolli
that
is
true
what
are
you
saying
cured
doctor
it
appears
so
i
should
say
so
belcredi
yes
yes
they
have
told
us
so
to
the
four
young
donna
matilda
yes
for
a
long
time
he
has
confided
in
them
told
them
the
truth
di
nolli
more
indignant
than
but
what
does
it
mean
if
up
to
a
short
time
ago
belcredi
hum
he
was
acting
to
take
you
in
and
also
us
who
in
good
faith
di
nolli
is
it
possible
to
deceive
his
sister
also
right
up
to
the
time
of
her
death
henry
iv
apart
peering
at
one
and
now
at
the
other
under
the
accusation
and
the
mockery
of
what
all
believe
to
be
a
cruel
joke
of
his
which
is
now
revealed
he
has
shown
by
the
flashing
of
his
eyes
that
he
is
meditating
a
revenge
which
his
violent
contempt
prevents
him
from
defining
clearly
as
yet
stung
to
the
quick
and
with
a
clear
idea
of
accepting
the
fiction
they
have
insidiously
worked
up
as
true
he
bursts
forth
at
this
go
on
i
say
go
on
di
nolli
at
the
go
on
what
do
you
mean
henry
iv
it
is
sister
only
that
is
dead
di
nolli
my
sister
yours
i
say
whom
you
compelled
up
to
the
last
moment
to
present
herself
here
as
your
mother
agnes
henry
iv
and
was
she
not
mother
di
nolli
my
mother
certainly
my
mother
henry
iv
but
your
mother
is
dead
for
me
and
far
you
have
just
got
down
now
from
there
to
the
frame
from
which
he
jumped
and
how
do
you
know
whether
i
have
not
wept
her
long
in
secret
dressed
even
as
i
am
donna
matilda
looking
at
the
what
does
he
say
impressed
observing
quietly
quietly
for
heaven
sake
henry
iv
what
do
i
say
i
ask
all
of
you
if
agnes
was
not
the
mother
of
henry
to
frida
as
if
she
were
really
the
marchioness
of
you
marchioness
it
seems
to
me
ought
to
know
frida
frightened
draws
closer
to
di
no
no
i
do
know
not
i
doctor
it
the
madness
returning
quiet
now
everybody
belcredi
madness
indeed
doctor
he
acting
again
henry
iv
i
you
have
emptied
those
two
frames
over
there
and
he
stands
before
my
eyes
as
henry
iv
belcredi
we
had
enough
of
this
joke
now
henry
iv
who
said
joke
doctor
to
do
excite
him
for
the
love
of
god
belcredi
lending
an
ear
to
him
but
speaking
but
they
have
said
so
again
to
the
four
young
they
they
henry
iv
round
and
looking
at
you
did
you
say
it
was
all
a
joke
landolph
and
no
really
we
said
that
you
were
cured
belcredi
look
here
enough
of
this
donna
does
it
seem
to
you
that
the
sight
of
him
to
di
marchioness
and
that
of
your
daughter
dressed
so
is
becoming
an
intolerable
puerility
donna
matilda
oh
be
quiet
what
does
the
dress
matter
if
he
is
cured
henry
iv
cured
yes
i
am
cured
ah
but
not
to
let
it
end
this
way
all
at
once
as
you
suppose
do
you
know
that
for
twenty
years
nobody
has
ever
dared
to
appear
before
me
here
like
you
and
that
gentleman
to
the
belcredi
of
course
i
know
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
too
appeared
before
you
this
morning
dressed
henry
iv
as
a
monk
yes
belcredi
and
you
took
me
for
peter
damiani
and
i
even
laugh
believing
in
fact
that
henry
iv
that
i
was
mad
does
it
make
you
laugh
seeing
her
like
that
now
that
i
am
cured
and
yet
you
might
have
remembered
that
in
my
eyes
her
appearance
now
himself
with
a
gesture
of
ah
turns
to
the
you
are
a
doctor
you
doctor
yes
henry
iv
and
you
also
took
part
in
dressing
her
up
as
the
marchioness
of
tuscany
to
prepare
a
for
me
here
eh
donna
matilda
no
no
what
do
you
say
it
was
done
for
you
i
did
it
for
your
sake
doctor
to
attempt
to
try
not
knowing
henry
iv
him
i
understand
i
say
in
his
case
because
he
believes
that
i
have
been
carrying
on
a
jest
belcredi
but
excuse
me
what
do
you
mean
you
say
yourself
you
are
cured
henry
iv
let
me
speak
the
do
you
know
doctor
that
for
a
moment
you
ran
the
risk
of
making
me
mad
again
by
god
to
make
the
portraits
speak
to
make
them
jump
alive
out
of
their
frames
doctor
but
you
saw
that
all
of
us
ran
in
at
once
as
soon
as
they
told
us
henry
iv
certainly
frida
and
di
nolli
and
then
looks
at
the
marchioness
and
finally
at
his
own
the
combination
is
very
beautiful
two
couples
very
good
very
good
doctor
for
a
madman
not
bad
a
slight
wave
of
his
hand
to
it
seems
to
him
now
to
be
a
carnival
out
of
season
eh
to
look
at
we
get
rid
now
of
this
masquerade
costume
of
mine
so
that
i
may
come
away
with
you
what
do
you
say
belcredi
with
me
with
us
henry
iv
where
shall
we
go
to
the
club
in
dress
coats
and
with
white
ties
or
shall
both
of
us
go
to
the
house
belcredi
wherever
you
like
do
you
want
to
remain
here
still
to
continue
alone
what
was
nothing
but
the
unfortunate
joke
of
a
day
of
carnival
it
is
really
incredible
incredible
how
you
have
been
able
to
do
all
this
freed
from
the
disaster
that
befell
you
henry
iv
yes
you
see
how
it
was
the
fact
is
that
falling
from
my
horse
and
striking
my
head
as
i
did
i
was
really
mad
for
i
know
not
how
long
doctor
ah
did
it
last
long
henry
iv
quickly
to
the
yes
doctor
a
long
time
i
think
it
must
have
been
about
twelve
years
suddenly
turning
to
speak
to
thus
i
saw
nothing
my
dear
fellow
of
all
that
after
that
day
of
carnival
happened
for
you
but
not
for
me
how
things
changed
how
my
friends
deceived
me
how
my
place
was
taken
by
another
and
all
the
rest
of
it
and
suppose
my
place
had
been
taken
in
the
heart
of
the
woman
i
loved
and
how
should
i
know
who
was
dead
or
who
had
disappeared
all
this
you
know
was
exactly
a
jest
for
me
as
it
seems
to
you
belcredi
no
no
i
do
mean
that
if
you
please
i
mean
after
henry
iv
ah
yes
after
one
day
and
addresses
the
a
most
interesting
case
doctor
study
me
well
study
me
carefully
while
all
by
itself
who
knows
how
one
day
the
trouble
here
his
mended
little
by
little
i
open
my
eyes
and
at
first
i
do
know
whether
i
am
asleep
or
awake
then
i
know
i
am
awake
i
touch
this
thing
and
that
i
see
clearly
again
ah
then
as
says
to
away
away
with
this
masquerade
this
incubus
let
open
the
windows
breathe
life
once
again
away
away
let
run
out
pulling
himself
but
where
and
to
do
what
to
show
myself
to
all
secretly
as
henry
not
like
this
but
arm
in
arm
with
you
among
my
dear
friends
belcredi
what
are
you
saying
donna
matilda
who
could
think
it
it
not
to
be
imagined
it
was
an
accident
henry
iv
they
all
said
i
was
mad
before
and
you
know
it
you
were
more
ferocious
than
any
one
against
those
who
tried
to
defend
me
belcredi
oh
that
was
only
a
joke
henry
iv
look
at
my
hair
him
the
hair
on
the
nape
of
his
belcredi
but
mine
is
grey
too
henry
iv
yes
with
this
difference
that
mine
went
grey
here
as
henry
do
you
understand
and
i
never
knew
it
i
perceived
it
all
of
a
sudden
one
day
when
i
opened
my
eyes
and
i
was
terrified
because
i
understood
at
once
that
not
only
had
my
hair
gone
grey
but
that
i
was
all
grey
inside
that
everything
had
fallen
to
pieces
that
everything
was
finished
and
i
was
going
to
arrive
hungry
as
a
wolf
at
a
banquet
which
had
already
been
cleared
away
belcredi
yes
but
what
about
the
others
henry
iv
ah
yes
i
know
they
could
wait
until
i
was
cured
not
even
those
who
behind
my
back
pricked
my
saddled
horse
till
it
bled
di
nolli
what
what
henry
iv
yes
treacherously
to
make
it
rear
and
cause
me
to
fall
donna
matilda
in
this
is
the
first
time
i
knew
that
henry
iv
that
was
also
a
joke
probably
donna
matilda
but
who
did
it
who
was
behind
us
then
henry
iv
it
does
matter
who
it
was
all
those
that
went
on
feasting
and
were
ready
to
leave
me
their
scrapings
marchioness
of
miserable
pity
or
some
dirty
remnant
of
remorse
in
the
filthy
plate
thanks
quickly
to
the
now
doctor
the
case
must
be
absolutely
new
in
the
history
of
madness
i
preferred
to
remain
mad
since
i
found
everything
ready
and
at
my
disposal
for
this
new
exquisite
fantasy
i
would
live
it
this
madness
of
mine
with
the
most
lucid
consciousness
and
thus
revenge
myself
on
the
brutality
of
a
stone
which
had
dinted
my
head
the
solitude
this
solitude
squalid
and
empty
as
it
appeared
to
me
when
i
opened
my
eyes
again
i
determined
to
deck
it
out
with
all
the
colours
and
splendors
of
that
far
off
day
of
carnival
when
you
at
donna
matilda
and
points
frida
out
to
when
you
marchioness
triumphed
so
i
would
oblige
all
those
who
were
around
me
to
follow
by
god
at
my
orders
that
famous
pageant
which
had
been
for
you
and
not
for
me
the
jest
of
a
day
i
would
make
it
become
for
ever
no
more
a
joke
but
a
reality
the
reality
of
a
real
madness
here
all
in
masquerade
with
throne
room
and
these
my
four
secret
counsellors
secret
and
of
course
traitors
turns
quickly
towards
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
have
gained
by
revealing
the
fact
that
i
was
cured
if
i
am
cured
there
no
longer
any
need
and
you
will
be
discharged
to
give
anyone
one
confidence
that
is
really
the
act
of
a
madman
but
now
i
accuse
you
in
my
turn
to
the
do
you
know
they
thought
to
the
they
could
make
fun
of
me
too
with
you
out
laughing
the
others
laugh
but
shamefacedly
except
donna
belcredi
di
well
imagine
that
that
not
bad
di
nolli
the
four
young
you
henry
iv
we
must
pardon
them
this
dress
his
which
is
for
me
the
evident
involuntary
caricature
of
that
other
continuous
everlasting
masquerade
of
which
we
are
the
involuntary
puppets
when
without
knowing
it
we
mask
ourselves
with
that
which
we
appear
to
be
ah
that
dress
of
theirs
this
masquerade
of
theirs
of
course
we
must
forgive
it
them
since
they
do
not
yet
see
it
is
identical
with
themselves
again
to
you
know
it
is
quite
easy
to
get
accustomed
to
it
one
walks
about
as
a
tragic
character
just
as
if
it
were
nothing
the
tragic
in
a
room
like
this
look
here
doctor
i
remember
a
priest
certainly
irish
a
priest
who
was
sleeping
in
the
sun
one
november
day
with
his
arm
on
the
corner
of
the
bench
of
a
public
garden
he
was
lost
in
the
golden
delight
of
the
mild
sunny
air
which
must
have
seemed
for
him
almost
summery
one
may
be
sure
that
in
that
moment
he
did
not
know
any
more
that
he
was
a
priest
or
even
where
he
was
he
was
dreaming
a
little
boy
passed
with
a
flower
in
his
hand
he
touched
the
priest
with
it
here
on
the
neck
i
saw
him
open
his
laughing
eyes
while
all
his
mouth
smiled
with
the
beauty
of
his
dream
he
was
forgetful
of
everything
but
all
at
once
he
pulled
himself
together
and
stretched
out
his
priest
cassock
and
there
came
back
to
his
eyes
the
same
seriousness
which
you
have
seen
in
mine
because
the
irish
priests
defend
the
seriousness
of
their
catholic
faith
with
the
same
zeal
with
which
i
defend
the
secret
rights
of
hereditary
monarchy
i
am
cured
gentlemen
because
i
can
act
the
mad
man
to
perfection
here
and
i
do
it
very
quietly
i
only
sorry
for
you
that
have
to
live
your
madness
so
agitatedly
without
knowing
it
or
seeing
it
belcredi
it
comes
to
this
then
that
it
is
we
who
are
mad
that
what
it
is
henry
iv
his
but
if
you
mad
both
you
and
she
the
would
you
have
come
here
to
see
me
belcredi
to
tell
the
truth
i
came
here
believing
that
you
were
the
madman
henry
iv
indicating
the
and
she
belcredi
ah
as
for
her
i
ca
say
i
see
she
is
all
fascinated
by
your
words
by
this
madness
of
yours
to
dressed
as
you
are
to
you
could
even
remain
here
to
live
it
out
marchioness
donna
matilda
you
are
insolent
henry
iv
no
marchioness
what
he
means
to
say
is
that
the
miracle
would
be
complete
according
to
him
with
you
here
who
as
the
marchioness
of
tuscany
you
well
know
could
not
be
my
friend
save
as
at
canossa
to
give
me
a
little
pity
belcredi
or
even
more
than
a
little
she
said
so
herself
henry
iv
the
marchioness
and
even
shall
we
say
a
little
remorse
belcredi
yes
that
too
she
has
admitted
donna
matilda
now
look
here
henry
iv
to
placate
do
bother
about
him
do
mind
him
let
him
go
on
infuriating
me
though
the
doctor
told
him
not
to
to
but
do
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
trouble
myself
any
more
about
what
happened
between
us
the
share
you
had
in
my
misfortune
with
her
the
marchioness
to
him
and
pointing
belcredi
out
to
the
part
he
has
now
in
your
life
this
is
my
life
quite
a
different
thing
from
your
life
your
life
the
life
in
which
you
have
grown
old
i
have
not
lived
that
life
donna
was
this
what
you
wanted
to
show
me
with
this
sacrifice
of
yours
dressing
yourself
up
like
this
according
to
the
doctor
idea
excellently
done
doctor
oh
an
excellent
idea
as
we
were
then
eh
and
as
we
are
now
but
i
am
not
a
madman
according
to
your
way
of
thinking
doctor
i
know
very
well
that
that
man
there
di
can
not
be
me
because
i
am
henry
and
have
been
these
twenty
years
cast
in
this
eternal
masquerade
she
has
lived
these
years
the
she
has
enjoyed
them
and
has
become
look
at
her
a
woman
i
can
no
longer
recognize
it
is
so
that
i
knew
her
to
frida
and
draws
near
this
is
the
marchioness
i
know
always
this
one
you
seem
a
lot
of
children
to
be
so
easily
frightened
by
me
and
you
frightened
too
little
girl
are
you
by
the
jest
that
they
made
you
take
part
in
though
they
did
understand
it
would
be
the
jest
they
meant
it
to
be
for
me
oh
miracle
of
miracles
prodigy
of
prodigies
the
dream
alive
in
you
more
than
alive
in
you
it
was
an
image
that
wavered
there
and
they
made
you
come
to
life
oh
mine
you
mine
mine
mine
in
my
own
right
holds
her
in
his
arms
laughing
like
a
madman
while
all
stand
still
terrified
then
as
they
advance
to
tear
frida
from
his
arms
he
becomes
furious
terrible
and
cries
imperiously
to
his
hold
them
hold
them
i
order
you
to
hold
them
four
young
men
amazed
yet
fascinated
move
to
execute
his
orders
automatically
and
seize
di
nolli
the
doctor
and
belcredi
leave
her
alone
leave
her
alone
you
no
madman
henry
iv
a
flash
draws
the
sword
from
the
side
of
landolph
who
is
close
to
i
not
mad
eh
take
that
you
sword
into
him
a
cry
of
horror
goes
up
all
rush
over
to
assist
belcredi
crying
out
di
nolli
has
he
wounded
you
berthold
yes
yes
seriously
doctor
i
told
you
so
frida
oh

god
di

come
here
donna

he
mad
mad

him
away
by

protests
as
he

you

he
not
mad
go
out
by
the
left
amid
cries
and
excitement
after
a
moment
one
hears
a
still
sharper
more
piercing
cry
from
donna
matilda
and
then
henry
iv
has
remained
on
the
stage
between
landolph
harold
and
ordulph
with
his
eyes
almost
starting
out
of
his
head
terrified
by
the
life
of
his
own
masquerade
which
has
driven
him
to
ah
now
yes
now
inevitably
his
valets
around
him
as
if
to
protect
here
together
here
together
for
ever
for
ever
note
to
henry
iv
with
the
author
consent
and
approval
the
translator
has
omitted
a
few
lines
from
the
original
italian
where
their
highly
parenthetical
character
made
the
english
version
unnecessarily
complex
one
or
two
allusions
have
also
been
suppressed
since
they
have
not
the

a
man
nearing

quick

energetic
in
his

is
smartly
dressed
in
good
taste

this

he
is

angry

she
gives
you
to
understand
that
if
she
had
a
free
rein
she
would
be
quite
capable
of
playing
her
own
part
in
the
world
and
perhaps
do
it
somewhat
better
than
commendatore
dina
the
daughter
of
amalia
and
agazzi
she
is
nineteen
her
general
manner
is
that
of
a
young
person
conscious
of
understanding
everything
better
than
papa
and
mamma
but
this
defect
must
not
be
exaggerated
to
the
extent
of
concealing
her
attractiveness
and
charm
as
a
winsome
the
curtain
rises
laudisi
is
walking
briskly
up
and
down
the
parlor
to
give
vent
to
his
laudisi
i
see
i
see
so
he
did
take
the
matter
up
with
the
prefect
amalia
but
lamberto
please
remember
that
the
man
is
a
subordinate
of
his
laudisi
a
subordinate
of
his
very
well
but
a
subordinate
in
the
office
not
at
home
nor
in
society
dina
and
he
hired
an
apartment
for
that
woman
his
right
here
in
this
very
building
and
on
our
floor
laudisi
and
why
not
pray
he
was
looking
for
an
apartment
the
apartment
was
for
rent
so
he
leased
it
for
his
you
mean
to
say
that
a
is
in
duty
bound
to
make
advances
to
the
wife
and
daughter
of
the
man
who
happens
to
be
her
superior
on
his
job
amalia
that
is
not
the
way
it
is
lamberto
we
did
ask
her
to
call
on
us
dina
and
i
took
the
first
step
by
calling
on
her
and
she
to
us
laudisi
well
is
that
any
reason
why
your
husband
should
go
and
lodge
a
complaint
with
the
man
boss
do
you
expect
the
government
to
order
him
to
invite
you
to
tea
amalia
i
think
he
deserves
all
he
gets
that
is
not
the
way
to
treat
two
ladies
i
hope
he
gets
fired
the
idea
laudisi
oh
you
women
i
say
making
that
complaint
is
a
dirty
trick
by
jove
if
people
see
fit
to
keep
to
themselves
in
their
own
houses
have
they
a
right
to
amalia
yes
but
you
do
understand
we
were
trying
to
do
her
a
favor
she
is
new
in
the
town
we
wanted
to
make
her
feel
at
home
dina
now
now
nunky
dear
do
be
so
cross
perhaps
we
did
go
there
out
of
curiosity
more
than
anything
else
but
it
all
so
funny
is
it
do
you
think
it
was
natural
to
feel
just
a
little
bit
curious
laudisi
natural
be
damned
it
was
none
of
your
business
dina
now
see
here
nunky
let
suppose
here
you
are
right
here
minding
your
own
business
and
quite
indifferent
to
what
other
people
are
doing
all
around
you
very
well
i
come
into
the
room
and
right
here
on
this
table
under
your
very
nose
and
with
a
long
face
like
an
undertaker
or
rather
with
the
long
face
of
that
jailbird
you
are
defending
i
set
down
well
what
anything
a
pair
of
dirty
old
shoes
laudisi
i
do
see
the
connection
dina
wait
do
interrupt
me
i
said
a
pair
of
old
shoes
well
no
not
a
pair
of
old
shoes
a
flat
iron
a
rolling
pin
or
your
shaving
brush
for
instance
and
i
walk
out
again
without
saying
a
word
to
anybody
now
i
leave
it
to
you
would
you
feel
justified
in
wondering
just
a
little
little
bit
as
to
what
in
the
world
i
meant
by
it
laudisi
oh
you
irresistible
dina
and
you
clever
are
you
but
you
talking
with
old
nunky
remember
you
see
you
have
been
putting
all
sorts
of
crazy
things
on
the
table
here
and
you
did
it
with
the
idea
of
making
me
ask
what
it
all
about
and
of
course
since
you
were
doing
all
that
on
purpose
you
ca
blame
me
if
i
do
ask
why
those
old
shoes
just
there
on
that
table
dearie
but
what
all
that
got
to
do
with
it
you
have
to
show
me
now
that
this
ponza
of
ours
that
jailbird
as
you
say
or
that
rascal
that
boor
as
your
father
calls
him
brought
his
to
the
apartment
next
to
ours
with
the
idea
of
stringing
us
all
you
got
to
show
me
that
he
did
it
on
purpose
dina
i
do
say
that
he
did
it
on
purpose
not
at
all
but
you
ca
deny
that
this
famous
ponza
has
come
to
this
town
and
done
a
number
of
things
which
are
unusual
to
say
the
least
and
which
he
must
have
known
were
likely
to
arouse
a
very
natural
curiosity
in
everybody
look
nunky
here
is
a
man
he
comes
to
town
to
fill
an
important
public
position
and
what
does
he
do
where
does
he
go
to
live
he
hires
an
apartment
on
the
floor
if
you
please
of
that
dirty
old
tenement
out
there
on
the
very
outskirts
of
the
town
now
i
ask
you
did
you
ever
see
the
place
inside
laudisi
i
suppose
you
went
and
had
a
look
at
it
dina
yes
nunky
dear
i
went
with
mamma
and
we
the
only
ones
you
know
the
whole
town
has
been
to
have
a
look
at
it
it
a
five
story
tenement
with
an
interior
court
so
dark
at
noontime
you
can
hardly
see
your
hand
before
your
face
well
there
is
an
iron
balcony
built
out
from
the
fifth
story
around
the
courtyard
a
basket
is
hanging
from
the
railing
they
let
it
up
and
down
on
a
rope
laudisi
well
what
of
it
dina
at
him
with
astonished
what
of
it
well
there
if
you
please
is
where
he
keeps
his
wife
amalia
while
her
mother
lives
here
next
door
to
us
laudisi
a
fashionable
apartment
for
his
in
the
residential
district
amalia
generous
to
the
old
lady
eh
but
he
does
that
to
keep
her
from
seeing
her
daughter
laudisi
how
do
you
know
that
how
do
you
know
that
the
old
lady
rather
does
not
prefer
this
arrangement
just
to
have
more
elbow
room
for
herself
dina
no
no
nunky
you
wrong
everybody
knows
that
it
is
he
who
is
doing
it
amalia
see
here
lamberto
everybody
understands
if
a
girl
when
she
marries
goes
away
from
her
mother
to
live
with
her
husband
in
some
other
town
but
supposing
this
poor
mother
ca
stand
being
separated
from
her
daughter
and
follows
her
to
the
place
where
she
herself
is
also
a
complete
stranger
and
supposing
now
she
not
only
does
not
live
with
her
daughter
but
is
not
even
allowed
to
see
her
i
leave
it
to
you
is
that
so
easy
to
understand
laudisi
oh
say
you
have
about
as
much
imagination
as
so
many
mud
turtles
a
and
a
is
it
so
hard
to
suppose
that
either
through
her
fault
or
his
fault
or
the
fault
of
both
they
should
find
it
hard
to
get
along
together
and
should
therefore
consider
it
wiser
to
live
apart
dina
another
look
of
pitying
astonishment
at
her
how
stupid
of
you
nunky
the
trouble
is
not
between
the
and
the
but
between
the
mother
and
the
daughter
laudisi
how
do
you
know
that
dina
because
he
is
as
thick
as
pudding
with
the
old
lady
because
they
are
always
together
arm
in
arm
and
as
loving
as
can
be
and
if
you
please
whoever
heard
the
like
of
that
amalia
and
he
comes
here
every
evening
to
see
how
the
old
lady
is
getting
on
dina
and
that
is
not
the
worst
of
it
sometimes
he
comes
during
the
daytime
once
or
twice
laudisi
how
scandalous
do
you
think
he
is
making
love
to
the
old
woman
dina
now
do
be
improper
uncle
no
we
will
acquit
him
of
that
she
is
a
poor
old
lady
quite
on
her
last
legs
amalia
but
he
never
never
never
brings
his
wife
a
daughter
kept
from
seeing
her
mother
the
idea
laudisi
perhaps
the
young
lady
is
not
well
perhaps
she
is
able
to
go
out
dina
nonsense
the
old
lady
goes
to
see
amalia
exactly
and
she
never
gets
in
she
can
see
her
only
from
a
distance
now
will
you
explain
to
me
why
in
the
name
of
common
sense
that
poor
mother
should
be
forbidden
ever
to
enter
her
daughter
house
dina
and
if
she
wants
to
talk
to
her
she
has
to
shout
up
from
the
courtyard
amalia
five
stories
if
you
please
and
her
daughter
comes
out
and
looks
down
from
the
balcony
up
there
the
poor
old
woman
goes
into
the
courtyard
and
pulls
a
string
that
leads
up
to
the
balcony
a
bell
rings
the
girl
comes
out
and
her
mother
talks
up
at
her
her
head
thrown
back
just
as
though
she
were
shouting
from
out
of
a
well
is
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
butler
butler
callers
madam
amalia
who
is
it
please
butler
signor
sirelli
and
the
signora
with
another
lady
madam
amalia
very
well
show
them
in
butler
bows
and
signora
sirelli
signora
cini
appear
in
the
doorway
sirelli
a
man
of
about
forty
is
a
bald
fat
gentleman
with
some
pretensions
to
stylish
appearance
that
do
not
quite
succeed
the
overdressed
signora
sirelli
wife
plump
petite
a
faded
blonde
still
young
and
girlishly
pleasing
she
too
is
somewhat
overdressed
with
the
provincial
fondness
for
display
she
has
the
aggressive
curiosity
of
the
gossip
she
is
chiefly
occupied
in
keeping
her
husband
in
his
signora
cini
the
old
provincial
lady
of
affected
manners
who
takes
malicious
delight
in
the
failings
of
others
all
the
while
affecting
innocence
and
inexperience
regarding
the
waywardness
of
amalia
the
visitors
enter
and
taking
signora
hands
dearest
dearest
signora
sirelli
i
took
the
liberty
of
bringing
my
good
friend
signora
cini
along
she
was
so
anxious
to
know
you
amalia
so
good
of
you
to
come
signora
please
make
yourself
at
home
my
daughter
dina
signora
cini
and
this
is
my
brother
lamberto
laudisi
sirelli
to
the
signora
signorina
goes
over
and
shakes
hands
with
signora
sirelli
amalia
dearest
we
have
come
here
as
to
the
fountain
of
knowledge
we
are
two
pilgrims
athirst
for
the
truth
amalia
the
truth
truth
about
what
signora
sirelli
why
about
this
blessed
ponza
of
ours
the
new
secretary
at
the
prefecture
he
is
the
talk
of
the
town
take
my
word
for
it
amalia
signora
cini
and
we
are
all
just
dying
to
find
out
amalia
but
we
are
as
much
in
the
dark
as
the
rest
of
you
i
assure
you
madam
sirelli
his
what
did
i
tell
you
they
know
no
more
about
it
than
i
do
in
fact
i
think
they
know
less
about
it
than
i
do
why
is
it
this
poor
woman
is
not
allowed
to
see
her
daughter
do
you
know
the
reason
you
people
the
real
reason
amalia
why
i
was
just
discussing
the
matter
with
my
brother
laudisi
and
my
view
of
it
is
that
you
all
a
pack
of
gossips
dina
the
reason
is
they
say
that
ponza
will
not
allow
her
to
signora
cini
not
a
sufficient
reason
if
i
may
say
so
signorina
signora
sirelli
quite
insufficient
there
more
to
it
than
that
sirelli
i
have
a
new
item
for
you
fresh
right
off
the
ice
he
keeps
her
locked
up
at
home
amalia
his
sirelli
no
no
his
wife
signora
cini
under
lock
and
key
dina
there
nunky
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
and
been
trying
to
defend
him
all
along
sirelli
in
astonishment
at
trying
to
defend
that
man
really
laudisi
defending
him
no
i
am
not
defending
anybody
all
i
saying
if
you
ladies
will
excuse
me
is
that
all
this
gossip
is
not
worthy
of
you
more
than
that
you
are
just
wasting
your
breath
because
so
far
as
i
can
see
not
getting
anywhere
at
all
sirelli
i
do
follow
you
sir
laudisi
you
getting
nowhere
my
charming
ladies
signora
cini
but
we
trying
to
get
somewhere
we
are
trying
to
find
out
laudisi
excuse
me
what
can
you
find
out
what
can
we
really
know
about
other
people
who
they
are
what
they
are
what
they
are
doing
and
why
they
are
doing
it
signora
sirelli
how
can
we
know
why
not
by
asking
of
course
you
tell
me
what
you
know
and
i
tell
you
what
i
know
laudisi
in
that
case
madam
you
ought
to
be
the
best
informed
person
in
the
world
why
your
husband
knows
more
about
what
others
are
doing
than
any
other
man
or
woman
for
that
matter
in
this
neighborhood
sirelli
but
oh
i
say
i
say
signora
sirelli
her
no
dear
he
right
he
right
turning
to
the
real
truth
amalia
is
this
for
all
my
husband
says
he
knows
i
never
manage
to
keep
posted
on
anything
sirelli
and
no
wonder
the
trouble
is
that
woman
never
trusts
me
the
moment
i
tell
her
something
she
is
convinced
it
is
not
as
i
say
then
sooner
or
later
she
claims
that
it
be
as
i
say
and
at
last
she
is
certain
it
is
the
exact
opposite
of
what
i
say
signora
sirelli
well
you
ought
to
hear
all
he
tells
me
laudisi
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah
may
i
speak
madam
let
me
answer
your
husband
my
dear
sirelli
how
do
you
expect
your
wife
to
be
satisfied
with
things
as
you
explain
them
to
her
if
you
as
is
natural
represent
them
as
they
seem
to
you
signora
sirelli
and
that
means
as
they
can
not
possibly
be
laudisi
why
no
signora
now
you
are
wrong
from
your
husband
point
of
view
things
are
i
assure
you
exactly
as
he
represents
them
sirelli
as
they
are
in
reality
signora
sirelli
not
at
all
you
are
always
wrong
sirelli
no
not
a
bit
of
it
it
is
you
who
are
always
wrong
i
am
always
right
laudisi
the
fact
is
that
neither
of
you
is
wrong
may
i
explain
i
will
prove
it
to
you
now
here
you
are
you
sirelli
and
signora
sirelli
your
wife
there
and
here
i
am
you
see
me
do
you
sirelli
well
er
yes
laudisi
do
you
see
me
or
do
you
not
sirelli
oh
i
bite
of
course
i
see
you
laudisi
so
you
see
me
but
that
not
enough
come
here
sirelli
he
obeys
but
with
a
puzzled
expression
on
his
face
as
though
he
fails
to
understand
what
laudisi
is
driving
well
here
i
am
laudisi
yes
now
take
a
better
look
at
me
touch
me
that
it
that
it
now
you
are
touching
me
are
you
not
and
you
see
me
you
sure
you
see
me
sirelli
why
i
should
say
laudisi
yes
but
the
point
is
you
sure
of
course
you
sure
now
if
you
please
signora
sirelli
you
come
here
or
rather
no
it
is
my
place
to
come
to
you
goes
over
to
signora
sirelli
and
kneels
chivalrously
on
one
you
see
me
do
you
not
madam
now
that
hand
of
yours
touch
me
a
pretty
hand
on
my
word
pats
her
sirelli
easy
easy
laudisi
never
mind
your
husband
madam
now
you
have
touched
me
have
you
not
and
you
see
me
and
you
are
absolutely
sure
about
me
are
you
not
well
now
madam
i
beg
of
you
do
not
tell
your
husband
nor
my
sister
nor
my
niece
nor
signora
cini
here
what
you
think
of
me
because
if
you
were
to
do
that
they
would
all
tell
you
that
you
are
completely
wrong
but
you
see
you
are
really
right
because
i
am
really
what
you
take
me
to
be
though
my
dear
madam
that
does
not
prevent
me
from
also
being
really
what
your
husband
my
sister
my
niece
and
signora
cini
take
me
to
be
because
they
also
are
absolutely
right
signora
sirelli
in
other
words
you
are
a
different
person
for
each
of
us
laudisi
of
course
i
a
different
person
and
you
madam
pretty
as
you
are
are
you
a
different
person
too
signora
sirelli
no
siree
i
assure
you
as
far
as
i
concerned
i
always
the
same
always
yesterday
today
and
forever
laudisi
ah
but
so
am
i
from
my
point
of
view
believe
me
and
i
would
say
that
you
are
all
mistaken
unless
you
see
me
as
i
see
myself
but
that
would
be
an
inexcusable
presumption
on
my
part
as
it
would
be
on
yours
my
dear
madam
sirelli
and
what
has
all
this
rigmarole
got
to
do
with
it
may
i
ask
laudisi
what
has
it
got
to
do
with
it
why
i
find
all
you
people
here
at
your
wits
ends
trying
to
find
out
who
and
what
other
people
are
just
as
though
other
people
had
to
be
this
or
that
and
nothing
else
signora
sirelli
all
you
are
saying
is
that
we
can
never
find
out
the
truth
a
dreadful
idea
signora
cini
i
give
up
i
give
up
if
we
ca
believe
even
what
we
see
with
our
eyes
and
feel
with
our
fingers
laudisi
but
you
must
understand
madam
of
course
you
can
believe
what
you
see
with
eyes
and
feel
with
fingers
all
i
saying
is
that
you
should
show
some
respect
for
what
other
people
see
with
their
eyes
and
feel
with
their
fingers
even
though
it
be
the
exact
opposite
of
what
you
see
and
feel
signora
sirelli
the
way
to
answer
you
is
to
refuse
to
talk
with
you
see
i
turn
my
back
on
you
i
am
going
to
move
my
chair
around
and
pretend
you
are
in
the
room
why
driving
me
crazy
crazy
laudisi
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
do
let
me
interfere
with
your
party
please
go
on
pray
continue
your
argument
about
signora
frola
and
signor
ponza
i
promise
not
to
interrupt
again
amalia
you
right
for
once
lamberto
and
i
think
it
would
be
even
better
if
you
should
go
into
the
other
room
dina
serves
you
right
nunky
into
the
other
room
with
you
into
the
other
room
laudisi
no
i
refuse
to
budge
fact
is
i
enjoy
hearing
you
gossip
but
i
promise
not
to
say
anything
more
do
fear
at
the
very
most
with
your
permission
i
shall
indulge
in
a
laugh
or
two
signora
sirelli
how
funny
and
our
idea
in
coming
here
was
to
find
out
but
really
amalia
i
thought
this
ponza
man
was
your
husband
secretary
at
the
provincial
building
amalia
he
is
his
secretary
in
the
office
but
here
at
home
what
authority
has
agazzi
over
the
fellow
signora
sirelli
of
course
i
understand
but
may
i
ask
have
you
even
tried
to
see
signora
frola
next
door
dina
tried
i
should
say
we
had
twice
signora
signora
cini
well
so
then
you
have
probably
talked
to
her
dina
we
were
not
if
you
please
signora
sirelli
sirelli
signora
cini
not
received
why
why
why
dina
this
very
forenoon
amalia
the
first
time
we
waited
fully
fifteen
minutes
at
the
door
we
rang
and
rang
and
rang
and
no
one
came
why
we
were
even
able
to
leave
our
cards
so
we
went
back
today
dina
up
her
hands
in
an
expression
of
and
came
to
the
door
signora
sirelli
why
yes
with
that
face
of
his
you
can
tell
by
just
looking
at
the
man
such
a
face
such
a
face
you
ca
blame
people
for
talking
and
then
with
that
black
suit
of
his
why
they
all
dress
in
black
did
you
ever
notice
even
the
old
lady
and
the
man
eyes
too
sirelli
a
glance
of
pitying
disgust
at
his
what
do
you
know
about
his
eyes
you
never
saw
his
eyes
and
you
never
saw
the
woman
how
do
you
know
she
dresses
in
black
she
dresses
in
black
by
the
way
they
come
from
a
little
town
in
the
next
county
had
you
heard
that
a
village
called
marsica
amalia
yes
the
village
that
was
destroyed
a
short
time
ago
sirelli
exactly
by
an
earthquake
not
a
house
left
standing
in
the
place
dina
and
all
their
relatives
were
lost
i
have
heard
not
one
of
them
left
in
the
world
signora
cini
to
get
on
with
the
very
well
very
well
so
then
he
came
to
the
door
amalia
yes
and
the
moment
i
saw
him
in
front
of
me
with
that
weird
face
of
his
i
had
hardly
enough
gumption
left
to
tell
him
that
we
had
just
come
to
call
on
his
and
he
well
not
a
word
not
a
word
not
even
a
thank
you
if
you
please
dina
that
is
not
quite
fair
mama
he
did
bow
amalia
well
yes
a
bow
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
something
like
this
dina
and
his
eyes
you
ought
to
see
his
eyes
the
eyes
of
a
devil
and
then
some
you
never
saw
a
man
with
eyes
like
that
signora
cini
very
well
what
did
he
say
finally
dina
he
seemed
quite
taken
aback
amalia
he
was
all
confused
like
he
hitched
about
for
a
time
and
at
last
he
said
that
signora
frola
was
not
feeling
well
but
that
she
would
appreciate
our
kindness
in
having
come
and
then
he
just
stood
there
and
stood
there
apparently
waiting
for
us
to
go
away
dina
i
never
was
more
mortified
in
my
life
sirelli
a
boor
a
plain
boor
i
say
oh
it
his
fault
i
am
telling
you
and
who
knows
perhaps
he
has
got
the
old
lady
also
under
lock
and
key
signora
sirelli
well
i
think
something
should
be
done
about
it
after
all
you
are
the
wife
of
a
superior
of
his
you
can
to
be
treated
like
that
amalia
as
far
as
that
goes
my
husband
did
take
it
rather
badly
as
a
lack
of
courtesy
on
the
man
part
and
he
went
straight
to
the
prefect
with
the
matter
insisting
on
an
apology
agazzi
commendatore
and
provincial
councillor
appears
in
the
doorway
dina
oh
goody
here
papa
now
agazzi
well
on
toward
fifty
he
has
the
harsh
authoritarian
manner
of
the
provincial
of
importance
red
hair
and
beard
rather
unkempt
agazzi
oh
sirelli
glad
to
see
you
steps
forward
and
bows
to
the
agazzi
signora
shakes
hands
with
signora
amalia
signora
my
husband
signora
cini
agazzi
a
bow
and
taking
her
a
great
pleasure
madam
turning
to
his
wife
and
daughter
in
a
mysterious
i
have
come
back
from
the
office
to
give
you
some
real
news
signora
frola
will
be
here
shortly
signora
sirelli
her
hands
oh
the
she
is
coming
really
coming
here
sirelli
over
to
agazzi
and
pressing
his
hand
warmly
as
an
expression
of
that
the
talk
old
man
that
the
talk
what
needed
here
is
some
show
of
authority
agazzi
why
i
had
to
you
see
i
had
to
i
ca
let
a
man
treat
my
wife
and
daughter
that
way
sirelli
i
should
say
not
i
was
just
expressing
myself
to
that
effect
right
here
signora
sirelli
and
it
would
have
been
entirely
proper
to
inform
the
prefect
also
agazzi
of
all
the
talk
that
is
going
around
on
this
fine
gentleman
account
oh
leave
that
to
me
i
did
miss
the
opportunity
sirelli
fine
fine
signora
cini
and
such
talk
amalia
for
my
part
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
why
do
you
know
he
has
them
both
under
lock
and
key
dina
no
mama
we
are
not
sure
of
that
we
are
not
sure
about
the
old
lady
yet
amalia
well
we
know
it
about
his
wife
anyway
sirelli
and
what
did
the
prefect
have
to
say
agazzi
oh
the
prefect
well
the
prefect
he
was
very
much
impressed
much
impressed
with
what
i
had
to
say
sirelli
i
should
hope
so
agazzi
you
see
some
of
the
talk
had
reached
his
ears
already
and
he
agrees
that
it
is
better
as
a
matter
of
his
own
official
prestige
for
all
this
mystery
in
connection
with
one
of
his
assistants
to
be
cleared
up
so
that
once
and
for
all
we
shall
know
the
truth
laudisi
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah
amalia
that
is
lamberto
usual
contribution
he
laughs
agazzi
and
what
is
there
to
laugh
about
signora
sirelli
why
he
says
that
no
one
can
ever
know
the
truth
butler
appears
at
the
door
in
back
the
butler
excuse
me
signora
frola
sirelli
ah
here
she
is
now
agazzi
now
we
see
if
we
can
settle
it
signora
sirelli
splendid
oh
i
am
so
glad
i
came
amalia
shall
we
have
her
come
in
agazzi
wait
you
keep
your
seat
amalia
let
have
her
come
right
in
here
to
the
show
her
in
moment
later
all
rise
as
signora
frola
enters
and
amalia
steps
forward
holding
out
her
hand
in
signora
frola
a
slight
modestly
but
neatly
dressed
old
lady
very
eager
to
talk
and
apparently
fond
of
people
there
is
a
world
of
sadness
in
her
eyes
tempered
however
by
a
gentle
smile
that
is
constantly
playing
about
her
amalia
come
right
in
signora
frola
takes
the
old
lady
hand
and
begins
the
sirelli
a
good
friend
of
mine
signora
cini
my
husband
sirelli
and
this
is
my
daughter
dina
my
brother
lamberto
laudisi
please
take
a
chair
signora
signora
frola
oh
i
am
so
very
very
sorry
i
have
come
to
excuse
myself
for
having
been
so
negligent
of
my
social
duties
you
signora
agazzi
were
so
kind
so
very
kind
to
have
honored
me
with
a
first
call
when
really
it
was
my
place
to
leave
my
card
with
you
amalia
oh
we
are
just
neighbors
signora
frola
why
stand
on
ceremony
i
just
thought
that
you
being
new
in
town
and
all
alone
by
yourself
would
perhaps
like
to
have
a
little
company
signora
frola
oh
how
very
kind
of
you
it
was
signora
sirelli
and
you
are
quite
alone
are
you
signora
frola
oh
no
no
i
have
a
daughter
married
though
she
has
been
here
very
long
either
sirelli
and
your
daughter
husband
is
the
new
secretary
at
the
prefecture
signor
ponza
i
believe
signora
frola
yes
yes
exactly
and
i
hope
that
signor
agazzi
as
his
superior
will
be
good
enough
to
excuse
me
and
him
too
agazzi
i
will
be
quite
frank
with
you
madam
i
was
a
bit
put
out
signora
frola
and
you
were
quite
right
but
i
do
hope
you
will
forgive
him
you
see
we
are
still
what
shall
i
say
still
so
upset
by
the
terrible
things
that
have
happened
to
us
amalia
you
went
through
the
earthquake
did
you
signora
sirelli
and
you
lost
all
your
relatives
signora
frola
every
one
of
them
all
our
family
yes
madam
and
our
village
was
left
just
a
miserable
ruin
a
pile
of
bricks
and
stones
and
mortar
sirelli
yes
we
heard
about
it
signora
frola
it
was
so
bad
for
me
i
suppose
i
had
only
one
sister
and
her
daughter
and
my
niece
had
no
family
but
my
poor
had
a
much
harder
time
of
it
he
lost
his
mother
two
brothers
and
their
wives
a
sister
and
her
husband
and
there
were
two
little
ones
his
nephews
sirelli
a
massacre
signora
frola
oh
one
does
forget
such
things
you
see
it
sort
of
leaves
you
with
your
feet
off
the
ground
amalia
i
can
imagine
signora
sirelli
and
all
with
no
warning
at
all
it
a
wonder
you
did
go
mad
signora
frola
well
you
see
we
have
quite
gotten
our
bearings
yet
and
we
do
things
that
may
seem
impolite
without
in
the
least
intending
to
i
hope
you
understand
agazzi
oh
please
signora
frola
of
course
amalia
in
fact
it
was
partly
on
account
of
your
trouble
that
my
daughter
and
i
thought
we
ought
to
go
to
see
you
first
signora
sirelli
writhing
with
yes
of
course
since
they
saw
you
all
alone
by
yourself
and
yet
excuse
me
signora
frola
if
the
question
seem
impertinent
how
is
it
that
when
you
have
a
daughter
here
in
town
and
after
a
disaster
like
the
one
you
have
been
through
i
should
think
you
people
would
all
stand
together
that
you
would
need
one
another
signora
frola
whereas
i
am
left
here
all
by
myself
sirelli
yes
exactly
if
does
seem
strange
to
tell
the
honest
truth
signora
frola
oh
i
understand
of
course
but
you
know
i
have
a
feeling
that
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
who
have
married
should
be
left
a
good
deal
to
themselves
laudisi
quite
so
quite
so
they
should
be
left
to
themselves
they
are
beginning
a
life
of
their
own
a
life
different
from
anything
they
have
led
before
one
should
not
interfere
in
these
relations
between
a
husband
and
a
wife
signora
sirelli
but
there
are
limits
to
everything
laudisi
if
you
will
excuse
me
and
when
it
comes
to
shutting
one
own
mother
out
of
one
life
laudisi
who
is
shutting
her
out
of
the
girl
life
here
if
i
have
understood
the
lady
we
see
a
mother
who
understands
that
her
daughter
can
not
and
must
not
remain
so
closely
associated
with
her
as
she
was
before
for
now
the
young
woman
must
begin
a
new
life
on
her
own
account
signora
frola
evidence
of
keen
gratitude
and
you
have
hit
the
point
exactly
sir
you
have
said
what
i
would
like
to
have
said
you
are
exactly
right
thank
you
signora
cini
but
your
daughter
i
imagine
often
comes
to
see
you
signora
frola
and
manifestly
ill
at
why
yes
i
i
we
do
see
each
other
of
course
sirelli
pressing
the
but
your
daughter
never
goes
out
of
her
house
at
least
no
one
in
town
has
ever
seen
her
signora
cini
oh
she
probably
has
her
little
ones
to
take
care
of
signora
frola
up
no
there
are
no
children
yet
and
perhaps
there
wo
be
any
now
you
see
she
has
been
married
seven
years
oh
of
course
she
has
a
lot
to
do
about
the
house
but
that
is
not
the
reason
really
you
know
we
women
who
come
from
the
little
towns
in
the
country
we
are
used
to
staying
indoors
much
of
the
time
agazzi
even
when
your
mothers
are
living
in
the
same
town
but
not
in
your
house
you
prefer
staying
indoors
to
going
and
visiting
your
mothers
amalia
but
it
signora
frola
probably
who
visits
her
daughter
signora
frola
of
course
of
course
why
not
i
go
there
once
or
twice
a
day
sirelli
and
once
or
twice
a
day
you
climb
all
those
stairs
up
to
the
fifth
story
of
that
tenement
eh
signora
frola
pale
and
trying
to
conceal
under
a
laugh
the
torture
of
that
why
er
to
tell
the
truth
i
do
go
up
you
right
five
flights
would
be
quite
too
much
for
me
no
i
do
go
up
my
daughter
comes
out
on
the
balcony
in
the
courtyard
and
well
we
see
each
other
and
we
talk
signora
sirelli
and
that
all
eh
how
terrible
you
never
see
each
other
more
intimately
than
that
dina
i
have
a
mama
and
certainly
i
would
expect
her
to
go
up
five
flights
of
stairs
to
see
me
either
but
at
the
same
time
i
could
never
stand
talking
to
her
that
way
shouting
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
from
a
balcony
on
the
fifth
story
i
am
sure
i
should
want
a
kiss
from
her
occasionally
and
feel
her
near
me
at
least
signora
frola
evident
signs
of
embarrassment
and
and
you
right
yes
exactly
quite
right
i
must
explain
yes
i
hope
you
people
are
not
going
to
think
that
my
daughter
is
something
she
really
is
not
you
must
not
suspect
her
of
having
so
little
regard
for
me
and
for
my
years
and
you
must
believe
that
i
her
mother
am
well
five
six
even
more
stories
to
climb
would
never
prevent
a
real
mother
even
if
she
were
as
old
and
infirm
as
i
am
from
going
to
her
daughter
side
and
pressing
her
to
her
heart
with
a
real
mother
love
oh
no
signora
sirelli
there
you
have
it
there
you
have
it
just
as
we
were
saying
signora
cini
but
there
must
be
a
reason
there
must
be
a
reason
amalia
to
her
aha
lamberto
now
you
see
there
a
reason
after
all
sirelli
your
i
suppose
signora
frola
oh
please
please
please
do
think
badly
of
he
is
such
a
very
good
boy
good
is
no
name
for
it
my
dear
sir
you
ca
imagine
all
he
does
for
me
kind
attentive
solicitous
for
my
comfort
everything
and
as
for
my
daughter
i
doubt
if
any
girl
ever
had
a
more
affectionate
and
husband
no
on
that
point
i
am
proud
of
myself
i
could
not
have
found
a
better
man
for
her
signora
sirelli
well
then
what
what
signora
cini
so
your
is
not
the
reason
agazzi
i
never
thought
it
was
his
fault
can
you
imagine
a
man
forbidding
his
wife
to
call
on
her
mother
or
preventing
the
mother
from
paying
an
occasional
visit
to
her
daughter
signora
frola
oh
it
not
a
case
of
forbidding
who
ever
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
no
it
we
commendatore
i
and
my
daughter
that
is
oh
please
believe
me
we
refrain
from
visiting
each
other
of
our
own
accord
out
of
consideration
for
him
you
understand
agazzi
but
excuse
me
how
in
the
world
could
he
be
offended
by
such
a
thing
i
understand
signora
frola
oh
please
do
be
angry
signor
agazzi
you
see
it
a
what
shall
i
say
a
feeling
that
it
a
feeling
which
it
would
perhaps
be
very
hard
for
anyone
else
to
understand
and
yet
when
you
do
understand
it
all
so
simple
i
am
sure
so
simple
and
believe
me
my
dear
friends
it
is
no
slight
sacrifice
that
i
am
making
and
that
my
daughter
is
making
too
agazzi
well
one
thing
you
will
admit
madam
this
is
a
very
very
unusual
situation
sirelli
unusual
indeed
and
such
as
to
justify
a
curiosity
even
more
persistent
than
ours
agazzi
it
is
not
only
unusual
madam
i
might
even
say
it
is
suspicious
signora
frola
suspicious
you
mean
you
suspect
signor
ponza
oh
please
commendatore
do
say
that
what
fault
can
you
possibly
find
with
him
signor
agazzi
agazzi
i
did
say
just
that
please
misunderstand
i
said
simply
that
the
situation
is
so
very
strange
that
people
might
legitimately
suspect
signora
frola
oh
no
no
no
what
could
they
suspect
we
are
in
perfect
agreement
all
of
us
and
we
are
really
quite
happy
very
happy
i
might
even
say
both
i
and
my
daughter
signora
sirelli
perhaps
it
a
case
of
jealousy
signora
frola
jealousy
of
me
it
would
be
hardly
fair
to
say
that
although
really
oh
it
is
so
hard
to
explain
you
see
he
is
in
love
with
my
daughter
so
much
so
that
he
wants
her
whole
heart
her
every
thought
as
it
were
for
himself
so
much
so
that
he
insists
that
the
affections
which
my
daughter
must
have
for
me
her
mother
he
finds
that
love
quite
natural
of
course
why
not
of
course
he
does
should
reach
me
through
him
that
it
through
him
do
you
understand
agazzi
oh
that
is
going
pretty
strong
no
i
understand
in
fact
it
seems
to
me
a
case
of
downright
cruelty
signora
frola
cruelty
no
no
please
do
call
it
cruelty
commendatore
it
is
something
else
believe
me
you
see
it
so
hard
for
me
to
explain
the
matter
nature
perhaps
but
no
that
hardly
the
word
what
shall
i
call
it
perhaps
a
sort
of
disease
it
a
fullness
of
love
of
a
love
shut
off
from
the
world
there
i
guess
that
it
a
fullness
a
completeness
of
devotion
in
which
his
wife
must
live
without
ever
departing
from
it
and
into
which
no
other
person
must
ever
be
allowed
to
enter
dina
not
even
her
mother
i
suppose
sirelli
it
is
the
worst
case
of
selfishness
i
ever
heard
of
if
you
want
my
opinion
signora
frola
selfishness
perhaps
but
a
selfishness
after
all
which
offers
itself
wholly
in
sacrifice
a
case
where
the
selfish
person
gives
all
he
has
in
the
world
to
the
one
he
loves
perhaps
it
would
be
fairer
to
call
me
selfish
for
selfish
it
surely
is
for
me
to
be
always
trying
to
break
into
this
closed
world
of
theirs
break
in
by
force
if
necessary
when
i
know
that
my
daughter
is
really
so
happy
so
passionately
adored
you
ladies
understand
you
a
true
mother
should
be
satisfied
when
she
knows
her
daughter
is
happy
ought
she
besides
i
not
completely
separated
from
my
daughter
am
i
i
see
her
and
i
speak
to
her
assumes
a
more
confidential
you
see
when
she
lets
down
the
basket
there
in
the
courtyard
i
always
find
a
letter
in
it
a
short
note
which
keeps
me
posted
on
the
news
of
the
day
and
i
put
in
a
little
letter
that
i
have
written
that
is
some
consolation
a
great
consolation
indeed
and
now
in
course
of
time
i
grown
used
to
it
i
am
resigned
there
resignation
that
it
and
i
ceased
really
to
suffer
from
it
at
all
amalia
oh
well
then
after
all
if
you
people
are
satisfied
why
should
signora
frola
oh
yes
yes
but
remember
i
told
you
he
is
such
a
good
man
believe
me
he
could
be
better
really
we
all
have
our
weaknesses
in
this
world
have
we
and
we
get
along
best
by
having
a
little
charity
a
little
indulgence
for
one
another
holds
out
her
hand
to
thank
you
for
calling
madam
bows
to
signora
sirelli
signora
cini
and
dina
then
turning
to
agazzi
she
and
i
do
hope
you
have
forgiven
me
agazzi
oh
my
dear
madam
please
please
and
we
are
extremely
grateful
for
your
having
come
to
call
on
us
signora
frola
her
hand
to
sirelli
and
laudisi
and
again
turning
to
amalia
who
has
risen
to
show
her
oh
no
please
signora
agazzi
please
stay
here
with
your
friends
do
put
yourself
to
any
trouble
amalia
no
no
i
will
go
with
you
and
believe
me
we
were
very
very
glad
to
see
you
signora
frola
with
amalia
showing
her
the
way
amalia
returns
sirelli
well
there
you
have
the
story
ladies
and
gentlemen
are
you
satisfied
with
the
explanation
agazzi
an
explanation
you
call
it
so
far
as
i
can
see
she
has
explained
nothing
i
tell
you
there
is
some
big
mystery
in
all
this
business
signora
sirelli
that
poor
woman
who
knows
what
torment
she
must
be
suffering
dina
and
to
think
of
that
poor
girl
signora
cini
she
could
hardly
keep
in
her
tears
as
she
talked
amalia
yes
and
did
you
notice
when
i
mentioned
all
those
stairs
she
would
have
to
climb
before
really
being
able
to
see
her
daughter
laudisi
what
impressed
me
was
her
concern
which
amounted
to
a
steadfast
determination
to
protect
her
from
the
slightest
suspicion
signora
sirelli
not
at
all
not
at
all
what
could
she
say
for
him
she
could
really
find
a
single
word
to
say
for
him
sirelli
and
i
would
like
to
know
how
anyone
could
condone
such
violence
such
downright
cruelty
the
butler
again
in
the
beg
pardon
sir
signor
ponza
calling
signora
sirelli
the
man
himself
upon
my
word
animated
ripple
of
surprise
and
curiosity
not
to
say
of
guilty
sweeps
over
the
agazzi
did
he
ask
to
see
me
butler
he
asked
simply
if
he
might
be
received
that
was
all
he
said
signora
sirelli
oh
please
signor
agazzi
please
let
him
come
in
i
am
really
afraid
of
the
man
but
i
confess
the
greatest
curiosity
to
have
a
close
look
at
the
monster
amalia
but
what
in
the
world
can
he
be
wanting
agazzi
the
way
to
find
that
out
is
to
have
him
come
in
the
show
him
in
please
butler
bows
and
goes
out
a
second
later
ponza
appears
aggressively
in
the
ponza
a
short
thick
set
dark
complexioned
man
of
a
distinctly
unprepossessing
appearance
black
hair
very
thick
and
coming
down
low
over
his
forehead
a
black
mustache
upcurling
at
the
ends
giving
his
face
a
certain
ferocity
of
expression
he
is
dressed
entirely
in
black
from
time
to
time
he
draws
a
handkerchief
and
wipes
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
when
he
speaks
his
eyes
are
invariably
hard
fixed
agazzi
this
way
please
ponza
come
right
in
signor
ponza
our
new
provincial
secretary
my
wife
signora
sirelli
signora
cini
my
daughter
dina
this
is
signor
sirelli
and
here
is
laudisi
my
please
join
our
party
wo
you
ponza
ponza
so
kind
of
you
you
will
pardon
the
intrusion
i
shall
disturb
you
only
a
moment
i
hope
agazzi
you
had
some
private
business
to
discuss
with
me
ponza
why
yes
but
i
could
discuss
it
right
here
in
fact
perhaps
as
many
people
as
possible
should
hear
what
i
have
to
say
you
see
it
is
a
declaration
that
i
owe
in
a
certain
sense
to
the
general
public
agazzi
oh
my
dear
ponza
if
it
is
that
little
matter
of
your
not
calling
on
us
it
is
quite
all
right
because
you
see
ponza
no
that
was
not
what
i
came
for
commendatore
it
was
not
to
apologize
for
her
indeed
i
may
say
that
signora
frola
my
wife
mother
would
certainly
have
left
her
cards
with
signora
agazzi
your
wife
and
signorina
agazzi
your
daughter
long
before
they
were
so
kind
as
to
honor
her
with
their
call
had
i
not
exerted
myself
to
the
utmost
to
prevent
her
coming
since
i
am
absolutely
unable
to
consent
to
her
passing
or
receiving
visits
agazzi
up
into
an
authoritative
attitude
and
speaking
with
some
why
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
explain
ponza
ponza
evidences
of
increasing
excitement
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
preserve
his
i
suppose
my
has
been
talking
to
you
people
about
her
daughter
my
wife
am
i
mistaken
and
i
imagine
she
told
you
further
that
i
have
forbidden
her
entering
my
house
and
seeing
her
daughter
intimately
amalia
oh
not
at
all
not
at
all
signor
ponza
signora
frola
had
only
the
nicest
things
to
say
about
you
she
could
not
have
spoken
of
you
with
greater
respect
and
kindness
dina
she
seems
to
be
very
fond
of
you
indeed
agazzi
she
says
that
she
refrains
from
visiting
your
house
of
her
own
accord
out
of
regard
for
feelings
of
yours
which
we
frankly
confess
we
are
unable
to
understand
signora
sirelli
indeed
if
we
were
to
express
our
honest
opinion
agazzi
well
yes
why
not
be
honest
we
think
you
are
extremely
harsh
with
the
woman
extremely
harsh
perhaps
cruel
would
be
an
exacter
word
ponza
yes
that
is
what
i
thought
and
i
came
here
for
the
express
purpose
of
clearing
the
matter
up
the
condition
this
poor
woman
is
in
is
a
pitiable
one
indeed
not
less
pitiable
than
my
own
perhaps
because
as
you
see
i
am
compelled
to
come
here
and
make
apologies
a
public
declaration
which
only
such
violence
as
has
just
been
used
upon
me
could
ever
bring
me
to
make
in
the
world
stops
and
looks
about
the
room
then
he
says
slowly
with
emphatic
emphasis
on
the
important
my
signora
frola
is
not
in
her
right
mind
she
is
insane
the
company
insane
a
lunatic
oh
my
really
no
impossible
ponza
and
she
has
been
insane
for
four
years
signora
sirelli
dear
me
who
would
ever
have
suspected
it
she
does
show
it
in
the
least
agazzi
insane
are
you
sure
ponza
she
does
show
it
does
she
but
she
is
insane
nevertheless
and
her
delusion
consists
precisely
in
believing
that
i
am
forbidding
her
to
see
her
daughter
face
takes
on
an
expression
of
cruel
suffering
mingled
with
a
sort
of
ferocious
what
daughter
for
god
sake
why
her
daughter
died
four
years
ago
general
everyone
at
once
died
she
is
dead
what
do
you
mean
oh
really
four
years
ago
why
why
ponza
four
years
ago
in
fact
it
was
the
death
of
the
poor
girl
that
drove
her
mad
sirelli
are
we
to
understand
that
the
wife
with
whom
you
are
now
living
ponza
exactly
she
is
my
second
wife
i
married
her
two
years
ago
amalia
and
signora
frola
believes
that
her
daughter
is
still
living
that
she
is
your
wife
still
ponza
perhaps
it
was
best
for
her
that
way
she
was
in
charge
of
a
nurse
in
her
own
room
you
see
well
when
she
chanced
to
see
me
passing
by
inadvertence
on
her
street
one
day
with
this
woman
my
second
wife
she
suddenly
began
to
laugh
and
cry
and
tremble
all
over
in
an
extreme
of
happiness
she
was
sure
her
daughter
whom
she
had
believed
dead
was
alive
and
well
and
from
a
condition
of
desperate
despondency
which
was
the
first
form
of
her
mental
disturbance
she
entered
on
a
second
obsession
believing
steadily
that
her
daughter
was
not
dead
at
all
but
that
i
the
poor
girl
husband
am
so
completely
in
love
with
her
that
i
want
her
wholly
for
myself
and
will
not
allow
anyone
to
approach
her
she
became
otherwise
quite
well
you
might
say
her
nervousness
disappeared
her
physical
condition
improved
and
her
powers
of
reasoning
returned
quite
clear
judge
for
yourself
ladies
and
gentlemen
you
have
seen
her
and
talked
with
her
you
would
never
suspect
in
the
world
that
she
is
crazy
amalia
never
in
the
world
never
signora
sirelli
and
the
poor
woman
says
she
is
so
happy
so
happy
ponza
that
is
what
she
says
to
everybody
and
for
that
matter
she
really
has
a
wealth
of
affection
and
gratitude
for
me
because
as
you
may
well
suppose
i
do
my
very
best
in
spite
of
the
sacrifices
entailed
to
keep
up
this
beneficial
illusion
in
her
the
sacrifices
you
can
readily
understand
in
the
first
place
i
have
to
maintain
two
homes
on
my
small
salary
then
it
is
very
hard
on
my
wife
it
but
she
poor
thing
does
the
very
best
she
can
to
help
me
out
she
comes
to
the
window
when
the
old
lady
appears
she
talks
to
her
from
the
balcony
she
writes
letters
to
her
but
you
people
will
understand
that
there
are
limits
to
what
i
can
ask
of
my
poor
wife
signora
frola
meanwhile
lives
practically
in
confinement
we
have
to
keep
a
pretty
close
watch
on
her
we
have
to
lock
her
up
virtually
otherwise
some
fine
day
she
would
be
walking
right
into
my
house
she
is
of
a
gentle
placid
disposition
fortunately
but
you
understand
that
my
wife
good
as
she
is
could
never
bring
herself
to
accepting
caresses
intended
for
another
woman
a
dead
woman
that
would
be
a
torment
beyond
conception
amalia
oh
of
course
poor
woman
just
imagine
signora
sirelli
and
the
old
lady
herself
consents
to
being
locked
up
all
the
time
ponza
you
commendatore
will
understand
that
i
permit
her
calling
here
except
under
absolute
constraint
agazzi
i
understand
perfectly
my
dear
ponza
and
you
have
my
deepest
sympathy
ponza
when
a
man
has
a
misfortune
like
this
fall
upon
him
he
must
not
go
about
in
society
but
of
course
when
by
complaining
to
the
prefect
you
practically
compelled
me
to
have
signora
frola
call
it
was
my
duty
to
volunteer
this
further
information
because
as
a
public
official
and
with
due
regard
for
the
post
of
responsibility
i
occupy
i
could
not
allow
any
discredible
suspicions
to
remain
attached
to
my
reputation
i
could
not
have
you
good
people
suppose
for
a
moment
that
out
of
jealousy
or
for
any
other
reason
i
could
ever
prevent
a
poor
suffering
mother
from
seeing
her
own
daughter
again
my
apologies
for
having
intruded
my
personal
troubles
upon
your
party
my
compliments
commendatore
good
afternoon
good
afternoon
thank
you
to
laudisi
sirelli
and
the
others
in
turn
he
goes
out
through
the
door
amalia
a
sigh
of
sympathy
and
uhh
crazy
what
do
you
think
of
that
signora
sirelli
the
poor
old
thing
but
you
would
have
believed
it
would
you
dina
i
always
knew
there
was
something
under
it
all
signora
cini
but
who
could
ever
have
guessed
agazzi
oh
i
do
know
i
do
know
you
could
tell
from
the
way
she
talked
laudisi
you
mean
to
say
that
you
thought
agazzi
no
i
ca
say
that
but
at
the
same
time
if
you
remember
she
could
never
quite
find
her
words
signora
sirelli
how
could
she
poor
thing
out
of
her
head
like
that
sirelli
and
yet
if
i
may
raise
the
question
it
seems
strange
to
me
that
an
insane
person
oh
i
admit
that
she
could
really
talk
rationally
but
what
surprises
me
is
her
trying
to
find
a
reason
to
explain
why
her
should
be
keeping
her
away
from
her
daughter
this
effort
of
hers
to
justify
it
and
then
to
adapt
herself
to
excuses
of
her
own
invention
agazzi
yes
but
that
is
only
another
proof
that
insane
you
see
she
kept
offering
excuses
for
ponza
that
really
were
not
excuses
at
all
amalia
yes
that
so
she
would
say
a
thing
without
really
saying
it
taking
it
back
almost
in
the
next
words
agazzi
but
there
is
one
more
thing
if
she
were
a
downright
lunatic
how
could
she
or
my
other
woman
ever
accept
such
a
situation
from
a
man
how
could
she
ever
consent
to
talk
with
her
own
daughter
only
by
shouting
up
from
the
bottom
of
a
well
five
stories
deep
sirelli
but
if
i
remember
rightly
she
has
you
there
notice
she
does
accept
the
situation
she
says
she
is
resigned
to
it
that
different
no
i
tell
you
there
is
still
something
funny
about
this
business
what
do
you
say
laudisi
laudisi
why
i
say
nothing
nothing
at
all
the
butler
at
the
door
and
visibly
beg
pardon
signora
frola
is
here
again
amalia
a
oh
dear
me
again
do
you
suppose
she
be
pestering
us
all
the
time
now
signora
sirelli
i
understand
how
you
feel
now
that
you
know
she
a
lunatic
signora
cini
my
my
what
do
you
suppose
she
is
going
to
say
now
sirelli
for
my
part
i
really
like
to
hear
what
she
got
to
say
dina
oh
yes
mamma
do
be
afraid
ponza
said
she
was
quite
harmless
let
have
her

signora
frola

come
in
you
know
all
these
ladies
they
were
here
when
you
came
before
signora
frola
an
expression
of
sadness
on
her
features
but
still
smiling
how
you
all
look
at
me
and
even
you
signora
agazzi
i
am
sure
you
think
i
am
a
lunatic
do
you
amalia
my
dear
signora
frola
what
in
the
world
are
you
talking
about
signora
frola
but
i
am
sure
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
disturb
you
for
a
moment
oh
my
dear
signora
agazzi
i
wish
i
had
left
things
as
they
were
it
was
hard
to
feel
that
i
had
been
impolite
to
you
by
not
answering
the
bell
when
you
called
that
first
time
but
i
could
never
have
supposed
that
you
would
come
back
and
force
me
to
call
upon
you
i
could
foresee
the
consequences
of
such
a
visit
from
the
very
first
amalia
why
not
at
all
not
at
all
i
do
understand
why
dina
what
consequences
could
you
foresee
madam
signora
frola
why
my
signor
ponza
has
just
been
here
has
he
agazzi
why
yes
he
was
here
he
came
to
discuss
certain
office
matters
with
me
just
ordinary
business
you
understand
signora
frola
hurt
and
quite
oh
i
know
you
are
saying
that
just
to
spare
me
just
in
order
not
to
hurt
my
feelings
agazzi
not
at
all
not
at
all
that
was
really
why
he
came
signora
frola
some
but
he
was
quite
calm
i
hope
quite
calm
agazzi
calm
as
calm
as
could
be
why
not
of
course
members
of
the
company
all
nod
in
signora
frola
oh
my
dear
friends
i
am
sure
you
are
trying
to
reassure
me
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
came
to
set
you
right
about
my
signora
sirelli
why
no
signora
what
the
trouble
agazzi
really
it
was
just
a
matter
of
politics
we
talked
about
signora
frola
but
i
can
tell
from
the
way
you
all
look
at
me
please
excuse
me
but
it
is
not
a
question
of
me
at
all
from
the
way
you
all
look
at
me
i
can
tell
that
he
came
here
to
prove
something
that
i
would
never
have
confessed
for
all
the
money
in
the
world
you
will
all
bear
me
out
wo
you
when
i
came
here
a
few
moments
ago
you
all
asked
me
questions
that
were
very
cruel
questions
to
me
as
i
hope
you
will
understand
and
they
were
questions
that
i
answer
very
well
but
anyhow
i
gave
an
explanation
of
our
manner
of
living
which
can
be
satisfactory
to
nobody
i
am
well
aware
but
how
could
i
give
you
the
real
reason
how
could
i
tell
you
people
as
he
doing
that
my
daughter
has
been
dead
for
four
years
and
that
i
a
poor
insane
mother
who
believes
that
her
daughter
is
still
living
and
that
her
husband
will
not
allow
me
to
see
her
agazzi
upset
by
the
ring
of
deep
sincerity
he
finds
in
signora
frola
manner
of
what
do
you
mean
your
daughter
signora
frola
and
with
anguished
dismay
written
on
her
you
know
that
so
why
do
you
try
to
deny
it
he
did
say
that
to
you
did
he
sirelli
some
hesitation
and
studying
her
features
yes
in
fact
he
did
say
that
signora
frola
i
know
he
did
and
i
also
know
how
it
pained
him
to
be
obliged
to
say
such
a
thing
of
me
it
is
a
great
pity
commendatore
we
have
made
continual
sacrifices
involving
unheard
of
suffering
i
assure
you
and
we
could
endure
them
only
by
living
as
we
are
living
now
unfortunately
as
i
well
understand
it
must
look
very
strange
to
people
seem
even
scandalous
arouse
no
end
of
gossip
but
after
all
if
he
is
an
excellent
secretary
scrupulously
honest
attentive
to
his
work
why
should
people
complain
you
have
seen
him
in
the
office
you
he
is
a
good
worker
is
he
agazzi
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
not
watched
him
particularly
as
yet
signora
frola
oh
he
really
is
he
really
is
all
the
men
he
ever
worked
for
say
he
most
reliable
and
i
beg
of
you
please
do
let
this
other
matter
interfere
and
why
then
should
people
go
tormenting
him
with
all
this
prying
into
his
private
life
laying
bare
once
more
a
misfortune
which
he
has
succeeded
in
mastering
and
which
if
it
were
widely
talked
about
might
upset
him
again
personally
and
even
hurt
him
in
his
career
agazzi
oh
no
no
signora
no
one
is
trying
to
hurt
him
it
is
nothing
to
his
disgrace
that
i
can
see
nor
would
we
hurt
you
either
signora
frola
but
my
dear
sir
how
can
you
help
hurting
me
when
you
force
him
to
give
almost
publicly
an
explanation
which
is
quite
absurd
ridiculous
i
might
even
say
surely
people
like
you
ca
seriously
believe
what
he
says
you
ca
possibly
be
taking
me
for
a
lunatic
you
do
really
think
that
this
woman
is
his
second
wife
and
yet
it
is
all
so
necessary
he
needs
to
have
it
that
way
it
is
the
only
way
he
can
pull
himself
together
get
down
to
his
work
again
the
only
way
the
only
way
why
he
gets
all
wrought
up
all
excited
when
he
is
forced
to
talk
of
this
other
matter
because
he
knows
himself
how
hard
it
is
for
him
to
say
certain
things
you
may
have
noticed
it
agazzi
yes
that
is
quite
true
he
did
seem
very
much
excited
signora
sirelli
well
well
well
so
then
it
he
sirelli
i
always
said
it
was
he
agazzi
oh
i
say
is
that
really
possible
motions
to
the
company
to
be
signora
frola
her
hands
my
dear
friends
what
are
you
really
thinking
it
is
only
on
this
subject
that
he
is
a
little
queer
the
point
is
you
must
simply
not
mention
this
particular
matter
to
him
why
really
now
you
could
never
suppose
that
i
would
leave
my
daughter
shut
up
with
him
all
alone
like
that
and
yet
just
watch
him
at
his
work
and
in
the
office
he
does
everything
he
is
expected
to
do
and
no
one
in
the
world
could
do
it
better
agazzi
but
this
is
not
enough
madam
as
you
will
understand
do
you
mean
to
say
that
signor
ponza
your
came
here
and
made
up
a
story
out
of
whole
cloth
signora
frola
yes
sir
yes
sir
exactly
only
i
will
explain
you
must
understand
you
must
look
at
things
from
his
point
of
view
agazzi
what
do
you
mean
do
you
mean
that
your
daughter
is
not
dead
signora
frola
god
forbid
of
course
she
is
not
dead
agazzi
well
then
he
is
the
lunatic
signora
frola
no
no
look
look
sirelli
i
always
said
it
was
he
signora
frola
no
look
look
not
that
not
that
let
me
explain
you
have
noticed
him
have
you
fine
strong
looking
man
well
when
he
married
my
daughter
you
can
imagine
how
fond
he
was
of
her
but
alas
she
fell
sick
with
a
contagious
disease
and
the
doctors
had
to
separate
her
from
him
not
only
from
him
of
course
but
from
all
her
relatives
they
all
dead
now
poor
things
in
the
earthquake
you
understand
well
he
just
refused
to
have
her
taken
to
the
hospital
and
he
got
so
that
they
actually
had
to
put
him
under
restraint
and
he
broke
down
nervously
as
the
result
of
it
all
and
he
was
sent
to
a
sanatorium
but
my
daughter
got
better
very
soon
while
he
got
worse
and
worse
he
had
a
sort
of
obsession
that
his
wife
had
died
in
the
hospital
that
perhaps
they
had
killed
her
there
and
you
could
get
that
idea
out
of
his
head
just
imagine
when
we
brought
my
daughter
back
to
him
quite
recovered
from
her
illness
and
a
pretty
thing
she
was
to
look
at
too
he
began
to
scream
and
say
no
no
no
she
was
his
wife
his
wife
was
dead
he
looked
at
her
no
no
no
not
at
all
she
was
the
woman
imagine
my
dear
friends
how
terrible
it
all
was
finally
he
came
up
close
to
her
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
he
was
going
to
recognize
her
again
but
once
more
it
was
no
no
no
she
is
not
my
wife
and
do
you
know
to
get
him
to
accept
my
daughter
at
all
again
we
were
obliged
to
pretend
having
a
second
wedding
with
the
collusion
of
his
doctors
and
his
friends
you
understand
signora
sirelli
ah
so
that
is
why
he
says
that
signora
frola
yes
but
he
does
really
believe
it
you
know
and
he
has
for
a
long
time
i
am
sure
but
he
seems
to
feel
a
need
for
maintaining
the
pretense
he
ca
do
without
it
he
feels
surer
of
himself
that
way
he
is
seized
with
a
terrible
fear
from
time
to
time
that
this
little
wife
he
loves
may
be
taken
from
him
again
and
in
a
low
confidential
so
he
keeps
her
locked
up
at
home
where
he
can
have
her
all
for
himself
but
he
worships
her
he
worships
her
and
i
am
really
quite
convinced
that
my
daughter
is
one
of
the
happiest
women
in
the
world
gets
and
now
i
must
be
going
you
see
my
is
in
a
terrible
state
of
mind
at
present
i
would
like
to
have
him
call
and
find
me
not
at
home
a
sigh
and
gesturing
with
her
joined
well
i
suppose
we
must
get
along
as
best
we
can
but
it
is
hard
on
my
poor
girl
she
has
to
pretend
all
along
that
she
is
not
herself
but
another
his
second
wife
and
i
oh
as
for
me
i
have
to
pretend
that
i
am
a
lunatic
when
he
around
my
dear
friends
but
i
glad
to
i
glad
to
really
so
long
as
it
does
him
some
good
ladies
rise
as
she
steps
nearer
to
the
no
no
do
let
me
interrupt
your
party
i
know
the
way
out
good
afternoon
good
afternoon
and
smiling
she
goes
out
through
the
rear
door
the
others
stands
there
in
silence
looking
at
each
other
with
blank
astonishment
on
their
laudisi
so
you
want
the
truth
eh
the
truth
the
truth
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah
act
ii
agazzi
study
in
the
same
house
antique
furnishings
with
old
paintings
on
the
walls
a
portière
over
the
rear
entrance
and
over
the
door
to
the
left
which
opens
into
the
drawing
room
shown
in
the
first
act
to
the
right
a
substantial
fireplace
with
a
big
mirror
above
the
mantel
a
flat
top
desk
with
a
telephone
a
sofa
armchairs
straight
back
chairs
the
curtain
rises
agazzi
is
shown
standing
beside
his
desk
with
the
telephone
receiver
pressed
to
his
ear
laudisi
end
sirelli
sit
looking
at
him
agazzi
yes
i
want
centuri
hello
hello
centuri
yes
agazzi
speaking
that
you
centuri
it
me
agazzi
well
listens
for
some
what
that
really
he
listens
at
i
understand
but
you
might
go
at
the
matter
with
a
little
more
speed
long
well
i
give
up
how
can
that
possibly
be
oh
i
see
i
see
well
never
mind
i
look
into
it
myself
goodbye
centuri
goodbye
lays
down
the
receiver
and
steps
forward
on
the
sirelli
well
agazzi
nothing
absolutely
nothing
sirelli
nothing
at
all
agazzi
you
see
the
whole
blamed
village
was
wiped
out
not
a
house
left
standing
in
the
collapse
of
the
town
hall
followed
by
a
fire
all
the
records
of
the
place
seem
to
have
been
lost
births
deaths
marriages
everything
sirelli
but
not
everybody
was
killed
they
ought
to
be
able
to
find
somebody
who
knows
them
agazzi
yes
but
you
see
they
did
rebuild
the
place
everybody
moved
away
and
no
record
was
ever
kept
of
the
people
of
course
so
far
they
have
found
nobody
who
knows
the
ponzas
to
be
sure
if
the
police
really
went
at
it
they
might
find
somebody
but
it
would
be
a
tough
job
sirelli
so
we
ca
get
anywhere
along
that
line
we
have
got
to
take
what
they
say
and
let
it
go
at
that
agazzi
that
unfortunately
is
the
situation
laudisi
well
you
fellows
take
a
piece
of
advice
from
me
believe
them
both
agazzi
what
do
you
mean
believe
them
both
sirelli
but
if
she
says
one
thing
and
he
says
another
laudisi
well
in
that
case
you
need
believe
either
of
them
sirelli
oh
you
just
joking
we
may
not
be
able
to
verify
the
stories
but
that
does
prove
that
either
one
or
the
other
may
not
be
telling
the
truth
some
document
or
other
laudisi
oh
documents
documents
suppose
you
had
them
what
good
would
they
do
you
agazzi
oh
i
say
perhaps
we
ca
get
them
now
but
there
were
such
documents
once
if
the
old
lady
is
the
lunatic
there
was
as
there
still
may
be
somewhere
the
death
certificate
of
the
daughter
or
look
at
it
from
the
other
angle
if
we
found
all
the
records
and
the
death
certificate
were
not
there
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
never
existed
why
then
it
ponza
the
he
would
be
the
lunatic
sirelli
you
mean
to
say
you
would
give
in
if
we
stuck
that
certificate
under
your
nose
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
would
you
still
deny
laudisi
deny
why
why
i
not
denying
anything
in
fact
i
very
careful
not
to
be
denying
anything
the
people
who
are
looking
up
the
records
to
be
able
to
affirm
or
deny
something
personally
i
do
give
a
rap
for
the
documents
for
the
truth
in
my
eyes
is
not
a
matter
of
black
and
white
but
a
matter
of
those
two
people
and
into
their
minds
i
can
penetrate
only
through
what
they
say
to
me
of
themselves
sirelli
very
well
she
says
he
crazy
and
he
says
crazy
now
one
of
them
must
be
crazy
you
ca
get
away
from
that
well
which
is
it
she
or
he
agazzi
there
that
the
way
to
put
it
laudisi
but
just
observe
in
the
first
place
it
is
true
that
they
are
accusing
each
other
of
insanity
ponza
to
be
sure
says
his
is
insane
she
denies
this
not
only
of
herself
but
also
of
him
at
the
most
she
says
that
he
was
a
little
off
once
when
they
took
her
daughter
from
him
but
that
now
he
is
quite
all
right
sirelli
i
see
so
you
rather
inclined
as
i
am
to
trust
what
the
old
lady
says
agazzi
the
fact
is
indeed
that
if
you
accept
his
story
all
the
facts
in
the
case
are
explained
laudisi
but
all
the
facts
in
the
case
are
explained
if
you
take
her
story
are
they
sirelli
oh
nonsense
in
that
case
neither
of
them
would
be
crazy
why
one
of
them
must
be
damn
it
all
laudisi
well
which
one
you
ca
tell
can
you
neither
can
anybody
else
and
it
is
not
because
those
documents
you
are
looking
for
have
been
destroyed
in
an
accident
a
fire
an
earthquake
what
you
will
but
because
those
people
have
concealed
those
documents
in
themselves
in
their
own
souls
ca
you
understand
that
she
has
created
for
him
or
he
for
her
a
world
of
fancy
which
has
all
the
earmarks
of
reality
itself
and
in
this
fictitious
reality
they
get
along
perfectly
well
and
in
full
accord
with
each
other
and
this
world
of
fancy
this
reality
of
theirs
no
document
can
possibly
destroy
because
the
air
they
breathe
is
of
that
world
for
them
it
is
something
they
can
see
with
their
eyes
hear
with
their
ears
and
touch
with
their
fingers
oh
i
grant
you
if
you
could
get
a
death
certificate
or
a
marriage
certificate
or
something
of
the
kind
you
might
be
able
to
satisfy
that
stupid
curiosity
of
yours
unfortunately
you
ca
get
it
and
the
result
is
that
you
are
in
the
extraordinary
fix
of
having
before
you
on
the
one
hand
a
world
of
fancy
and
on
the
other
a
world
of
reality
and
you
for
the
life
of
you
are
not
able
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other
agazzi
philosophy
my
dear
boy
philosophy
and
i
have
no
use
for
philosophy
give
me
facts
if
you
please
facts
so
i
say
keep
at
it
and
i
bet
you
we
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
sooner
or
later
sirelli
first
we
got
her
story
and
then
we
got
his
and
then
we
got
a
new
one
from
her
let
bring
the
two
of
them
together
and
you
think
that
then
we
wo
be
able
to
tell
the
false
from
the
true
laudisi
well
bring
them
together
if
you
want
to
all
i
ask
is
permission
to
laugh
when
you
through
agazzi
well
we
let
you
laugh
all
you
want
in
the
meantime
let
see
steps
to
the
door
at
the
left
and
amalia
signora
sirelli
wo
you
come
in
here
a
moment
ladies
enter
with
signora
sirelli
sight
of
laudisi
and
shaking
a
finger
at
but
how
is
it
a
man
like
you
in
the
presence
of
such
an
extraordinary
situation
can
escape
the
curiosity
we
all
feel
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
this
mystery
why
i
lie
awake
nights
thinking
of
it
agazzi
as
your
husband
says
that
man
impossible
bother
about
him
signora
sirelli
laudisi
no
do
bother
with
me
you
just
listen
to
agazzi
he
keep
you
from
lying
awake
tonight
agazzi
look
here
ladies
this
is
what
i
want
i
have
an
idea
wo
you
just
step
across
the
hall
to
signora
frola
amalia
but
will
she
come
to
the
door
agazzi
oh
i
imagine
she
will
dina
we
just
returning
the
call
you
see
amalia
but
did
he
ask
us
not
to
call
on
his
has
he
forbidden
her
to
receive
visits
sirelli
no
not
exactly
that
how
he
explained
what
had
happened
but
at
that
time
nothing
was
known
now
that
the
old
lady
through
force
of
circumstance
has
spoken
giving
her
version
at
least
of
her
strange
conduct
i
should
think
that
signora
sirelli
i
have
a
feeling
that
she
be
awfully
glad
to
see
us
if
for
nothing
else
for
the
chance
of
talking
about
her
daughter
dina
and
she
really
is
a
jolly
old
lady
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
not
the
slightest
ponza
is
the
lunatic
agazzi
now
let
not
go
too
fast
you
just
listen
to
me
looks
at
his
do
stay
too
long
five
or
ten
minutes
at
the
outside
sirelli
his
and
for
heaven
sake
keep
your
mouth
shut
signora
sirelli
and
why
such
considerate
advice
to
me
sirelli
once
get
going
dina
the
idea
of
preventing
a
oh
we
are
not
going
to
stay
very
long
ten
minutes
fifteen
at
the
outside
i
see
that
no
breaks
are
made
agazzi
and
i
just
drop
around
to
the
office
and
be
back
at
eleven
ten
or
twenty
minutes
at
the
most
sirelli
and
what
can
i
do
agazzi
wait
to
the
now
here
the
plan
you
people
invent
some
excuse
or
other
so
as
to
get
signora
frola
in
here
amalia
what
how
can
we
possibly
do
that
agazzi
oh
find
some
excuse
you
think
of
something
in
the
course
of
your
talk
and
if
you
do
there
dina
and
signora
sirelli
but
when
you
come
back
you
understand
go
into
the
drawing
room
steps
to
the
door
on
the
left
makes
sure
that
it
is
wide
open
and
draws
aside
the
this
door
must
stay
open
wide
open
so
that
we
can
hear
you
talking
from
in
here
now
here
are
some
papers
that
i
ought
to
take
with
me
to
the
office
however
i
forget
them
here
it
is
a
brief
that
requires
immediate
personal
attention
so
then
i
forget
it
and
when
i
get
to
the
office
i
have
to
bring
him
back
here
to
find
them
see
sirelli
but
just
a
moment
where
do
i
come
in
when
am
i
expected
to
appear
agazzi
oh
yes
a
moment
or
two
after
eleven
when
the
ladies
are
again
in
the
drawing
room
and
i
am
back
here
you
just
drop
in
to
take
your
wife
home
see
you
ring
the
bell
and
ask
for
me
and
i
have
you
brought
in
here
then
i
invite
the
whole
crowd
in
that
natural
enough
it
into
my
office
laudisi
and
we
have
the
truth
the
whole
truth
with
a
capital
t
dina
but
look
nunky
of
course
we
have
the
truth
once
we
get
them
together
face
to
face
capital
t
and
all
agazzi
do
get
into
an
argument
with
that
man
besides
it
time
you
ladies
were
going
none
of
us
has
any
too
much
leeway
signora
sirelli
come
amalia
come
dina
and
as
for
you
sir
to
i
wo
even
shake
hands
with
you
laudisi
permit
me
to
do
it
for
you
madam
shakes
one
hand
with
the
good
luck
to
you
my
dear
ladies
dina
amalia
signora
agazzi
and
now
we
better
go
too
suppose
we
hurry
sirelli
yes
right
away
goodbye
lamberto
laudisi
goodbye
good
luck
good
luck
and
sirelli
leave
laudisi
left
alone
walks
up
and
down
the
study
a
number
of
times
nodding
his
head
and
occasionally
smiling
finally
he
draws
up
in
front
of
the
big
mirror
that
is
hanging
over
the
mantelpiece
he
sees
himself
in
the
glass
stops
and
addresses
his
laudisi
so
there
you
are
bows
to
himself
and
salutes
touching
his
forehead
with
his
i
say
old
man
who
is
the
lunatic
you
or
i
levels
a
finger
menacingly
at
his
image
in
the
glass
and
of
course
the
image
in
turn
levels
a
finger
at
him
as
he
smiles
his
image
of
course
i
understand
i
say
it
you
and
you
say
it
me
you
you
are
the
lunatic
no
it
me
very
well
it
me
have
it
way
between
you
and
me
we
get
along
very
well
do
we
but
the
trouble
is
others
do
think
of
you
just
as
i
do
and
that
being
the
case
old
man
what
a
fix
you
in
as
for
me
i
say
that
here
right
in
front
of
you
i
can
see
myself
with
my
eyes
and
touch
myself
with
my
fingers
but
what
are
you
for
other
people
what
are
you
in
their
eyes
an
image
my
dear
sir
just
an
image
in
the
glass
what
fools
these
mortals
be
as
old
shakespeare
said
they
all
carrying
just
such
a
phantom
around
inside
themselves
and
here
they
are
racking
their
brains
about
the
phantoms
in
other
people
and
they
think
all
that
is
quite
another
thing
butler
has
entered
the
room
in
time
to
catch
laudisi
gesticulating
at
himself
in
the
glass
he
wonders
if
the
man
is
crazy
finally
he
speaks
butler
ahem
signor
laudisi
if
you
please
laudisi
to
uff
butler
two
ladies
calling
sir
signora
cini
and
another
lady
laudisi
calling
to
see
me
butler
really
they
asked
for
the
signora
but
i
said
that
she
was
out
on
a
call
next
door
and
then
laudisi
well
what
then
butler
they
looked
at
each
other
and
said
really
really
and
finally
they
asked
me
if
anybody
else
was
at
home
laudisi
and
of
course
you
said
that
everyone
was
out
butler
i
said
that
you
were
in
laudisi
why
not
at
all
i
miles
and
miles
away
perhaps
that
fellow
they
call
laudisi
is
here
butler
i
do
understand
sir
laudisi
why
you
think
the
laudisi
they
know
is
the
laudisi
i
am
butler
i
do
understand
sir
laudisi
whom
are
you
talking
to
butler
who
am
i
talking
to
i
thought
i
was
talking
to
you
laudisi
are
you
really
sure
the
laudisi
you
are
talking
to
is
the
laudisi
the
ladies
want
to
see
butler
why
i
think
so
sir
they
said
they
were
looking
for
the
brother
of
signora
agazzi
laudisi
ah
in
that
case
you
are
right
to
the
image
in
the
you
are
not
the
brother
of
signora
agazzi
no
it
me
the
right
you
are
tell
them
i
am
in
and
show
them
in
here
wo
you
butler
signora
cini
may
i
come
in
laudisi
please
please
this
way
madam
signora
cini
i
was
told
signora
agazzi
was
not
at
home
and
i
brought
signora
nenni
along
signora
nenni
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
she
was
most
anxious
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
laudisi
of
signora
frola
signora
cini
of
signora
agazzi
your
sister
laudisi
oh
she
will
be
back
very
soon
and
signora
frola
will
be
here
too
signora
cini
yes
we
thought
as
much
signora
nenni
an
oldish
woman
of
the
type
of
signora
cini
but
with
the
mannerisms
of
the
latter
somewhat
more
pronounced
she
too
is
a
bundle
of
concentrated
curiosity
but
of
the
sly
cautious
type
ready
to
find
something
frightful
under
laudisi
well
it
all
planned
in
advance
it
will
be
a
most
interesting
scene
the
curtain
rises
at
eleven
precisely
signora
cini
planned
in
advance
what
is
planned
in
advance
laudisi
first
with
a
gesture
of
his
finger
and
then
why
bringing
the
two
of
them
together
gesture
of
great
idea
i
tell
you
signora
cini
the
two
of
them
together
who
laudisi
why
the
two
of
them
he
in
here
to
the
room
about
signora
cini
ponza
you
mean
laudisi
and
she
in
there
points
toward
the
drawing
signora
cini
signora
frola
laudisi
exactly
an
expressive
gesture
of
his
hands
and
even
more
but
afterwards
all
of
them
in
here
oh
a
great
idea
a
great
idea
signora
cini
in
order
to
get
laudisi
the
truth
precisely
the
truth
signora
cini
but
the
truth
is
known
already
laudisi
of
course
the
only
question
is
stripping
it
bare
so
that
everyone
can
see
it
signora
cini
the
greatest
oh
really
so
they
know
the
truth
and
which
is
it
he
or
she
laudisi
well
i
tell
you
you
just
guess
who
do
you
think
it
is
signora
cini
well
i
say
really
you
see
laudisi
is
it
she
or
is
it
he
you
do
mean
to
say
you
do
know
come
now
give
a
guess
signora
cini
why
for
my
part
i
should
say
well
say
it
laudisi
at
her
right
you
are
it
he
signora
cini
really
i
always
thought
so
of
course
it
was
perfectly
plain
all
along
it
had
to
be
he
signora
nenni
all
of
us
women
in
town
said
it
was
he
we
always
said
so
signora
cini
but
how
did
you
get
at
it
i
suppose
signor
agazzi
ran
down
the
documents
did
he
the
birth
certificate
or
something
signora
nenni
through
the
prefect
of
course
there
was
no
getting
away
from
those
people
once
the
police
start
investigating
laudisi
to
them
to
come
closer
to
him
then
in
a
low
voice
and
in
the
same
mysterious
manner
and
stressing
each
the
certificate
of
the
second
marriage
signora
cini
back
with
what
signora
nenni
taken
what
did
you
say
the
second
marriage
signora
cini
well
in
that
case
he
was
laudisi
oh
documents
ladies
documents
this
certificate
of
the
second
marriage
so
it
seems
talks
as
plain
as
day
signora
nenni
well
then
is
the
lunatic
laudisi
right
you
are
she
it
is
signora
cini
but
i
thought
you
said
laudisi
yes
i
did
say
but
this
certificate
of
the
second
marriage
may
very
well
be
as
signora
frola
said
a
fictitious
document
gotten
up
through
the
influence
of
ponza
doctors
and
friends
to
pamper
him
in
the
notion
that
his
wife
was
not
his
first
wife
but
another
woman
signora
cini
but
it
a
public
document
you
mean
to
say
a
public
document
can
be
a
fraud
laudisi
i
mean
to
say
well
it
has
just
the
value
that
each
of
you
chooses
to
give
it
for
instance
one
could
find
somewhere
possibly
those
letters
that
signora
frola
said
she
gets
from
her
daughter
who
lets
them
down
in
the
basket
in
the
courtyard
there
are
such
letters
are
there
signora
cini
yes
of
course
laudisi
they
are
documents
are
they
are
letters
documents
but
it
all
depends
on
how
you
read
them
here
comes
ponza
and
he
says
they
are
just
made
up
to
pamper
his
in
her
obsession
signora
cini
oh
dear
dear
so
then
we
never
sure
about
anything
laudisi
never
sure
about
anything
why
not
at
all
not
at
all
let
be
exact
we
are
sure
of
many
things
are
we
how
many
days
are
there
in
the
week
seven
sunday
monday
tuesday
wednesday
how
many
months
in
the
year
are
there
twelve
january
february
march
signora
cini
oh
i
see
you
just
joking
you
just
joking
appears
breathless
in
the
doorway
at
the
dina
oh
nunky
wo
you
please
stops
at
the
sight
of
signora
oh
signora
cini
you
here
signora
cini
why
i
just
came
to
make
a
call
laudisi
with
signora
cenni
signora
nenni
no
my
name
is
nenni
laudisi
oh
yes
pardon
me
she
was
anxious
to
make
signora
frola
acquaintance
signora
nenni
why
not
at
all
signora
cini
he
has
just
been
making
fun
of
us
you
ought
to
see
what
fools
he
made
of
us
dina
oh
he
perfectly
insufferable
even
with
mamma
and
me
will
you
excuse
me
for
just
a
moment
no
everything
is
all
right
i
just
run
back
and
tell
mamma
that
you
people
are
here
and
i
think
that
will
be
enough
oh
nunky
if
you
had
only
heard
her
talk
why
she
is
a
perfect
and
what
a
good
kind
soul
she
showed
us
all
those
letters
her
daughter
wrote
signora
cini
yes
but
as
signor
laudisi
was
just
saying
dina
he
has
even
seen
them
signora
nenni
you
mean
they
are
not
really
fictitious
dina
fictitious
nothing
they
talk
as
plain
as
day
and
such
things
you
ca
fool
a
mother
when
her
own
daughter
talks
to
her
and
you
know
the
letter
she
got
yesterday
stops
at
the
sound
of
voices
coming
into
the
study
from
the
drawing
oh
here
they
are
here
they
are
already
goes
to
the
door
and
peeps
into
the
signora
cini
her
to
the
is
there
too
dina
yes
but
you
had
better
come
into
the
other
room
all
of
us
women
must
be
in
the
drawing
room
and
it
is
just
eleven
nunky
amalia
with
decision
from
the
door
on
the
i
think
this
whole
business
is
quite
unnecessary
we
have
absolutely
no
further
need
of
proofs
dina
quite
so
i
thought
of
that
myself
why
bring
ponza
here
amalia
somewhat
aback
by
signora
cinis
oh
my
dear
signora
cini
signora
cini
signora
a
friend
of
mine
signora
nenni
i
ventured
to
bring
her
with
me
amalia
but
somewhat
coolly
to
the
a
great
pleasure
signora
a
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
in
the
world
it
he
signora
cini
it
he
are
you
sure
it
he
dina
and
such
a
trick
on
the
poor
old
lady
amalia
trick
is
not
the
name
for
it
it
is
downright
dishonest
laudisi
oh
i
agree
with
you
it
outrageous
quite
so
much
so
i
quite
convinced
it
must
be
amalia
she
what
do
you
mean
how
can
you
say
that
laudisi
i
say
it
is
it
is
it
amalia
oh
i
say
if
you
had
heard
her
talk
dina
it
is
absolutely
clear
to
us
now
signora
cini
and
signora
nenni
really
you
are
sure
laudisi
exactly
now
that
you
are
sure
it
he
why
obviously
it
must
be
she
dina
oh
dear
me
why
talk
to
that
man
he
is
just
impossible
amalia
well
we
must
go
into
the
other
room
this
way
if
you
please
cini
signora
nenni
and
amalia
withdraw
through
the
door
on
the
left
dina
starts
to
follow
when
laudisi
calls
her
laudisi
dina
dina
i
refuse
to
listen
to
you
i
refuse
laudisi
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
since
the
whole
matter
is
closed
you
might
close
the
door
also
dina
but
papa
he
told
us
to
leave
it
open
ponza
will
be
here
soon
and
if
papa
finds
it
closed
well
you
know
how
papa
is
laudisi
but
you
can
convince
him
you
especially
you
can
show
him
that
there
really
was
no
need
of
going
any
further
you
are
convinced
yourself
are
you
dina
i
am
as
sure
of
it
as
i
am
that
i
alive
laudisi
her
to
the
test
with
a
well
close
the
door
then
dina
i
see
you
trying
to
make
me
say
that
i
not
really
sure
well
i
wo
close
the
door
but
it
just
on
account
of
papa
laudisi
shall
i
close
it
for
you
dina
if
you
take
the
responsibility
yourself
laudisi
but
you
see
am
sure
i
that
ponza
is
the
lunatic
dina
the
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
come
into
the
other
room
and
just
hear
her
talk
a
while
then
you
be
sure
absolutely
sure
coming
laudisi
yes
i
coming
and
i
close
the
door
behind
me
on
my
own
responsibility
of
course
dina
ah
i
see
so
you
convinced
even
before
you
hear
her
talk
laudisi
no
dear
it
because
i
sure
that
your
papa
who
has
been
with
ponza
is
just
as
certain
as
you
are
that
any
further
investigation
is
unnecessary
dina
how
can
you
say
that
laudisi
why
of
course
if
you
talk
with
ponza
you
sure
the
old
lady
is
crazy
walks
resolutely
to
the
i
am
going
to
shut
this
door
dina
him
nervously
then
hesitating
a
well
why
not
if
you
really
sure
what
do
you
say
let
leave
it
open
laudisi
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah
hah
dina
but
just
because
papa
told
us
to
laudisi
and
papa
will
tell
you
something
else
by
and
by
say
let
leave
it
open
piano
starts
playing
in
the
adjoining
room
an
ancient
lune
full
of
soft
and
solemn
melody
the
nina
of
dina
oh
there
she
is
she
playing
do
you
hear
actually
playing
the
piano
laudisi
the
old
lady
dina
yes
and
you
know
she
told
us
that
her
daughter
used
to
play
this
tune
always
the
same
tune
how
well
she
plays
come
come
hurry
through
the
stage
after
the
exit
of
laudisi
and
dina
remains
empty
for
a
space
of
time
while
the
music
continues
from
the
other
room
ponza
appearing
at
the
door
with
agazzi
catches
the
concluding
notes
and
his
face
changes
to
an
expression
of
deep
emotion
an
emotion
that
will
develop
into
a
virtual
frenzy
as
the
scene
agazzi
the
after
you
after
you
please
takes
ponza
elbow
and
motions
him
into
the
room
he
goes
over
to
his
desk
looks
about
for
the
papers
which
he
pretends
he
had
forgotten
finds
them
eventually
and
why
here
they
are
i
was
sure
i
had
left
them
here
you
take
a
chair
ponza
seems
not
to
hear
he
stands
looking
excitedly
at
the
door
into
the
drawing
room
through
which
the
sound
of
the
piano
is
still
agazzi
yes
they
are
the
ones
takes
the
papers
and
steps
to
ponza
side
opening
the
it
is
an
old
case
you
see
been
running
now
for
years
and
years
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
made
head
or
tail
of
the
stuff
myself
i
imagine
you
find
it
one
big
mess
too
becomes
aware
of
the
music
and
seems
somewhat
irritated
by
it
his
eyes
also
rest
on
the
door
to
the
drawing
that
noise
just
at
this
moment
walks
with
a
show
of
anger
to
the
who
is
that
at
the
piano
anyway
the
doorway
he
stops
and
looks
and
an
expression
of
astonishment
comes
into
his
ah
ponza
to
the
door
also
on
looking
into
the
next
room
he
can
hardly
restrain
his
in
the
name
of
god
is
playing
agazzi
yes
signora
frola
and
how
well
she
does
play
ponza
how
is
this
you
people
have
brought
her
in
here
again
and
you
letting
her
play
agazzi
why
not
what
the
harm
ponza
oh
please
please
no
not
that
song
it
is
the
one
her
daughter
used
to
play
agazzi
ah
i
see
and
it
hurts
you
ponza
oh
no
not
me
but
her
it
hurts
her
and
you
know
how
much
i
thought
i
had
made
you
and
those
women
understand
just
how
that
poor
old
lady
was
agazzi
yes
you
did
quite
true
but
you
see
but
see
here
ponza
to
pacify
the
man
growing
ponza
but
you
leave
her
alone
you
not
go
to
her
house
she
not
come
in
here
i
am
the
only
person
who
can
deal
with
her
you
are
killing
her
killing
her
agazzi
no
i
do
think
so
it
is
not
so
bad
as
that
my
wife
and
daughter
are
surely
tactful
enough
the
music
ceases
there
is
a
burst
of
agazzi
there
you
see
listen
listen
the
next
room
the
following
conversation
is
distinctly
dina
why
signora
frola
you
are
perfectly
at
the
piano
signora
frola
but
you
should
hear
how
my
lena
plays
digs
his
nails
into
his
agazzi
her
daughter
of
course
ponza
did
you
hear
how
my
lena
plays
how
my
lena
from
the
signora
frola
oh

not
now

played
for
a
long
time
since
that
happened
and
you
know
it
is
what
she
takes
hardest
poor
girl
agazzi
why
that
seems
quite
natural
to
me
of
course
she
thinks
the
girl
is
still
alive
ponza
but
she
should
be
allowed
to
say
such
things

there
looking
at

with
pity
and
terror
but
the
moment
signora
frola
has
left
the
room
he
regains
his
normal
composure
an
air
of
despairing
melancholy
and
he
says
coolly
but
with
profound
ponza
i
hope
you
good
people
will
excuse
me
for
this
scene
a
scene
it
really
was
i
suppose
but
how

avoid
it
i
had
to
rave
like
that
to
repair
the
damage
which
you
good
people
with
the
best
of
intentions
and

this
unfortunate
woman

in
blank
laudisi
and
there
ladies
and
gentlemen

the
truth

act
iii
same
scene
as
the
curtain
rises
laudisi
is
sprawling
in
an
easy
chair
reading
a
book
through
the
door
that
leads
into
the
parlor
on
the
left
comes
the
confused
murmur
of
many
butler
appears
in
the
rear
door
introducing
the
police
centuri
centuri
a
tall
stiff
scowling
official
with
a
decidedly
professional
air
he
is
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
butler
this
way
sir
i
will
call
signor
agazzi
at
once
laudisi
himself
up
in
his
chair
and
looking
oh
it
you
commissioner
rises
hastily
and
recalls
the
butler
who
has
stepped
out
through
the
one
moment
please
wait
anything
new
commissioner
commissioner
yes
something
new
laudisi
ah
very
well
the
never
mind
call
him
myself
motions
with
his
hand
toward
the
door
on
the
left
the
butler
bows
and
you
have
worked
miracles
commissioner
you
the
savior
of
this
town
listen
do
you
hear
them
you
are
the
lion
of
the
place
how
does
it
feel
to
be
the
father
of
your
country
but
say
what
you
discovered
is
all
solid
fact
commissioner
we
managed
to
unearth
a
few
people
laudisi
from
ponza
town
people
who
know
all
about
him
commissioner
yes
and
we
have
gathered
from
them
a
few
facts
not
many
perhaps
but
well
authenticated
laudisi
ah
that
nice
congratulations
for
example
commissioner
for
example
why
for
instance
here
well
here
are
all
the
communications
i
have
received
read
yourself
an
inner
pocket
he
draws
a
yellow
envelope
opened
at
one
end
from
which
he
takes
a
document
and
hands
it
to
laudisi
interesting
i
am
sure
very
interesting
stands
reading
the
document
carefully
commenting
from
time
to
time
with
exclamations
in
different
tones
first
an
ah
of
satisfaction
then
another
ah
which
attenuates
this
enthusiasm
very
much
finally
an
eh
of
disappointment
which
leads
to
another
eh
of
complete
why
no
what
all
this
amount
to
commissioner
commissioner
well
it
what
we
were
able
to
find
out
laudisi
but
this
does
prove
anything
you
understand
it
leaves
everything
just
where
it
was
there
nothing
of
any
significance
whatever
here
looks
at
the
commissioner
for
a
moment
and
then
as
though
suddenly
making
up
his
mind
he
i
wonder
commissioner
would
you
like
to
do
something
really
great
render
a
really
distinguished
service
to
this
town
and
meanwhile
lay
up
a
treasure
in
heaven
commissioner
at
him
in
what
are
you
thinking
of
sir
laudisi
i
explain
here
please
take
this
chair
sets
the
chair
in
front
of
agazzi
i
advise
you
commissioner
to
tear
up
this
sheet
of
paper
that
brought
and
which
has
absolutely
no
significance
at
all
but
here
on
this
other
piece
of
paper
why
do
you
write
down
something
that
will
be
precise
and
clear
commissioner
why
why
myself
what
do
you
mean
what
should
i
write
laudisi
anything
anything
at
all
anything
that
comes
into
your
head
provided
however
it
be
and
say
for
instance
that
signora
frola
is
a
lunatic
or
if
you
will
if
you
prefer
that
the
second
marriage
of
was
a
commissioner
i
do
get
you
signor
laudisi
what
are
you
driving
at
i
forge
the
document
laudisi
forge
just
say
something
anything
that
these
two
old
acquaintances
of
ponza
whom
you
managed
to
get
hold
of
might
have
said
come
commissioner
rise
to
the
occasion
do
something
for
the
commonwealth
bring
this
town
back
to
normal
again
do
you
see
what
they
are
after
they
all
want
the
truth
truth
that
is
something
specific
something
concrete
they
do
care
what
it
is
all
they
want
is
something
categorical
something
that
speaks
plainly
then
they
quiet
down
commissioner
truth
truth
excuse
me
have
i
understood
you
clearly
you
were
suggesting
that
i
commit
a
forgery
i
am
astonished
that
you
dare
propose
such
a
thing
and
when
i
say
i
am
astonished
i
not
saying
half
what
i
actually
feel
be
so
good
as
to
tell
the
commendatore
that
i
am
here
laudisi
his
arms
as
you
will
commissioner
steps
over
to
the
door
on
the
left
as
he
draws
the
portières
and
swings
the
door
more
widely
open
the
voices
become
louder
and
more
confused
as
he
steps
through
there
is
a
sudden
silence
the
police
commissioner
stands
waiting
with
a
satisfied
air
twirling
one
of
the
points
of
his
mustache
all
of
a
sudden
there
is
commotion
and
cheering
in
the
next
room
cries
of
delight
and
applause
mixed
with
the
police
commissioner
comes
out
of
his
reverie
and
looks
up
with
an
expression
of
surprise
on
his
features
as
though
not
understanding
what
it
all
about
through
the
door
to
the
left
come
agazzi
sirelli
laudisi
amalia
dina
signora
sirelli
signora
cini
signora
nenni
and
many
other
ladies
and
gentlemen
agazzi

the
procession
they
are
all
still
talking
and
laughing
excitedly
clapping
their
hands
and
crying

told

fine
fine
good
how
wonderful
now
we
know
agazzi

by
chief
company
fine
good
what
did
you
find
out
have
you
brought
something
is
it
she
is
it
he
tell
us
commissioner
does
yet
understand
what
all
the
excitement
is
about
for
him
it
has
been
a
mere
matter
of
why
no
why
commendatore
simply
you
understand
agazzi
hush
give
him
a
chance
commissioner
i
have
done
my
best
i
but
what
did
signor
laudisi
tell
you
agazzi
he
told
us
that
you
have
brought
news
real
news
sirelli
specific
data
clear
precise
laudisi
not
many
perhaps
but
well
authenticated
the
best
they
managed
to
trace
old
neighbors
of
ponza
you
see
people
well
acquainted
with
him
everybody
ah
at
last
at
last
now
we
know
i
at
last
commissioner
hands
the
document
to
commissioner
there
you
have
it
commendatore
agazzi
the
sheet
as
all
crowd
around
have
a
look
at
it
commissioner
but
you
signor
laudisi
laudisi
do
interrupt
please
the
document
speaks
for
itself
agazzi
you
read
it
agazzi
but
give
me
a
chance
wo
you
please
please
now
there
you
are
laudisi
oh
i
do
care
i
read
the
thing
already
everybody
around
you
read
it
already
what
did
it
say
is
it
he
is
it
she
laudisi
very
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
as
a
former
neighbor
of
ponza
testifies
that
the
woman
frola
was
once
in
a
sanatorium
the
group
of
oh
really
too
bad
too
bad
signora
sirelli
signora
frola
did
you
say
dina
are
you
sure
it
was
she
agazzi
why
no
why
no
it
does
say
anything
of
the
kind
forward
and
having
the
document
it
does
say
anything
of
the
kind
everybody
well
what
does
it
say
what
does
it
say
laudisi
it
does
too
it
says
the
frola
woman
the
frola
woman
categorically
agazzi
nothing
of
the
kind
the
witness
says
that
he
she
was
in
a
sanatorium
he
does
not
assert
that
she
was
besides
there
is
another
point
he
does
know
whether
this
frola
woman
who
was
in
a
sanatorium
was
the
mother
or
the
daughter
the
first
wife
that
is
everybody
ah
laudisi
but
i
say
he
does
it
must
be
the
mother
who
else
could
it
be
sirelli
no
of
course
it
the
daughter
it
the
daughter
signora
sirelli
just
as
the
old
lady
said
herself
amalia
exactly
that
time
when
they
took
her
away
by
force
from
her
husband
dina
yes
she
says
that
her
daughter
was
taken
to
a
sanatorium
on
account
of
a
contagious
disease
agazzi
furthermore
observe
another
thing
the
witness
does
not
really
belong
to
their
town
he
says
that
he
used
to
go
there
frequently
but
that
he
does
not
remember
particularly
he
remembers
that
he
heard
something
or
other
sirelli
ah
how
can
you
depend
on
such
a
man
testimony
nothing
but
hearsay
laudisi
but
excuse
me
if
all
you
people
are
so
sure
that
signora
frola
is
right
what
more
do
you
want
why
do
you
go
looking
for
documents
this
is
all
nonsense
sirelli
if
it
were
for
the
fact
that
the
prefect
has
accepted
ponza
side
of
the
story
i
tell
you
commissioner
yes
that
true
the
prefect
said
as
much
to
me
agazzi
yes
but
that
because
the
prefect
has
never
talked
with
the
old
lady
who
lives
next
door
signora
sirelli
you
bet
he
has
he
talked
only
with
ponza
sirelli
but
for
that
matter
there
are
other
people
of
the
same
mind
as
the
prefect
a
gentleman
that
is
my
situation
my
situation
exactly
yes
sir
because
i
know
of
just
such
as
case
where
a
mother
went
insane
over
the
death
of
her
daughter
and
insists
that
the
daughter
husband
will
not
allow
her
to
see
the
girl
the
same
case
to
a
a
second
gentleman
not
exactly
to
a
t
not
exactly
to
a
t
in
the
case
you
mention
the
man
did
marry
again
here
this
man
ponza
is
living
with
another
woman
laudisi
face
brightening
with
a
new
idea
that
has
suddenly
come
to
i
have
it
ladies
and
gentlemen
did
you
hear
that
it
perfectly
simple
dear
me
as
simple
as
columbus
egg
everybody
what
what
what
what
the
second
gentleman
what
did
i
say
i
did
realize
it
was
important
laudisi
just
a
moment
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
is
the
prefect
coming
here
by
chance
agazzi
yes
we
were
expecting
him
but
what
the
new
idea
laudisi
why
you
were
bringing
him
here
to
talk
with
signora
frola
so
far
he
is
standing
by
ponza
when
he
has
talked
with
the
old
lady
he
know
whether
to
believe
ponza
or
her
that
idea
well
i
thought
of
something
better
that
the
prefect
can
do
something
that
he
only
can
do
everybody
what
is
it
what
is
it
what
is
it
laudisi
why
this
wife
of
ponza
of
course
at
least
the
woman
he
is
living
with
what
this
gentleman
said
suggested
the
idea
to
me
sirelli
get
the
second
woman
to
talk
of
course
of
course
dina
but
how
can
we
when
she
is
kept
under
lock
and
key
laudisi
why
the
prefect
can
use
his
authority
order
her
to
speak
amalia
certainly
she
is
the
one
who
can
clear
up
the
whole
mystery
signora
sirelli
i
do
believe
it
she
say
just
what
her
husband
tells
her
to
say
laudisi
of
course
if
she
were
to
speak
in
his
presence
of
course
sirelli
she
must
speak
with
the
prefect
privately
all
by
himself
agazzi
and
the
prefect
as
the
final
authority
over
the
man
will
insist
that
the
wife
make
a
formal
explicit
statement
before
him
of
course
of
course
what
do
you
say
commissioner
commissioner
why
certainly
there
no
doubt
that
if
the
prefect
were
so
inclined
agazzi
it
is
the
only
way
out
of
it
after
all
we
ought
to
him
and
explain
that
he
need
go
to
the
trouble
of
coming
here
you
attend
to
that
will
you
commissioner
commissioner
very
glad
to
my
compliments
ladies
good
afternoon
gentlemen
signora
sirelli
a
good
idea
for
once
laudisi
dina
oh
nunky
how
clever
of
you
wise
old
nunky
the
company
the
only
way
out
of
it
yes
yes
fine
at
last
agazzi
curious
none
of
us
thought
of
that
before
sirelli
not
so
curious
none
of
us
ever
set
eyes
on
the
woman
she
might
as
well
be
in
another
world
poor
girl
laudisi
though
suddenly
impressed
by
this
latter
in
another
world
why
yes
are
you
really
sure
there
is
such
a
woman
amalia
oh
i
say
please
please
lamberto
sirelli
a
you
mean
to
say
you
think
there
is
no
such
woman
laudisi
how
can
you
be
sure
there
is
you
ca
guarantee
it
dina
but
the
old
lady
sees
her
and
talks
with
her
every
day
signora
sirelli
and
ponza
says
that
too
they
both
agree
on
that
point
laudisi
yes
yes
i
do
deny
that
but
just
a
moment
if
you
think
of
it
is
signora
frola
right
well
in
that
case
who
is
the
woman
in
ponza
eyes
the
phantom
of
a
second
wife
of
course
or
else
ponza
himself
is
right
and
in
that
case
you
have
the
phantom
of
a
daughter
in
the
old
lady
eyes
two
phantoms
in
other
words
now
we
got
to
find
out
ladies
and
gentlemen
whether
this
woman
who
must
be
a
mere
phantom
for
the
one
or
for
the
other
is
a
person
after
all
for
herself
in
the
situation
we
are
in
i
should
say
there
was
very
good
ground
for
doubting
agazzi
oh
you
make
me
tired
if
we
listen
to
you
laudisi
no
ladies
and
gentlemen
notice
it
may
be
that
she
is
nothing
but
a
phantom
in
her
own
eyes
signora
nenni
why
this
is
getting
to
be
almost
spooky
signora
cini
you
mean
to
say
it
a
ghost
a
real
ghost
how
can
you
frighten
us
so
everybody
nonsense
he
only
joking
he
only
joking
laudisi
not
a
bit
of
it
i
not
joking
at
all
who
ever
saw
the
woman
no
one
ever
set
eyes
on
her
he
talks
of
her
to
be
sure
and
she
the
old
woman
that
is
says
that
she
often
sees
her
sirelli
nonsense
any
number
of
people
have
seen
her
she
comes
to
the
balcony
of
the
courtyard
laudisi
who
comes
to
the
balcony
sirelli
a
woman
in
flesh
and
bones
in
skirts
for
that
matter
people
have
seen
her
and
people
have
heard
her
talk
for
heaven
sake
man
laudisi
are
you
sure
of
that
agazzi
and
why
not
pray
you
said
so
yourself
a
moment
ago
laudisi
why
yes
i
did
say
so
i
did
say
that
the
prefect
ought
to
have
a
talk
with
whatever
woman
is
there
but
notice
one
thing
it
is
certain
that
no
ordinary
woman
is
there
no
woman
of
that
much
we
can
be
sure
and
i
for
my
part
have
come
to
doubt
whether
she
is
in
any
sense
of
the
term
a
woman
signora
sirelli
dear
me
dear
me
that
man
simply
drives
me
crazy
laudisi
well
supposing
we
wait
and
see
everybody
well
who
is
she
then
but
people
have
seen
her
his
wife
on
the
balcony
she
writes
letters
police
commissioner
the
heat
of
the
confusion
comes
into
the
room
excitedly
the
prefect
is
coming
the
prefect
agazzi
what
do
you
mean
coming
here
but
you
went
to
commissioner
why
yes
but
i
met
him
hardly
a
block
away
he
was
coming
here
and
ponza
is
with
him
sirelli
ah
ponza
agazzi
oh
if
ponza
is
with
him
i
doubt
whether
he
is
coming
here
they
are
probably
on
their
way
to
the
old
lady
please
centuri
you
just
wait
on
the
landing
there
and
ask
him
if
he
wo
step
in
here
as
he
promised
commissioner
very
well
i
do
so
withdraws
hurriedly
through
the
door
in
the
agazzi
wo
you
people
just
step
into
the
other
room
signora
sirelli
but
remember
now
be
sure
to
make
him
see
the
point
it
the
only
way
out
the
only
way
amalia
the
door
to
the
this
way
ladies
if
you
please
agazzi
wo
you
just
stay
here
sirelli
and
you
too
lamberto
the
others
go
out
through
the
door
to
the
agazzi
but
let
me
do
the
talking
wo
you
laudisi
oh
as
for
that
do
worry
in
fact
if
you
prefer
i
go
into
the
other
room
agazzi
no
no
it
better
for
you
to
be
here
ah
here
he
is
now
the
prefect
a
man
of
about
sixty
tall
thick
set
good
natured
prefect
ah
agazzi
glad
to
see
you
how
goes
it
sirelli
good
to
see
you
again
laudisi
shakes
hands
all
agazzi
toward
a
i
hope
you
wo
mind
my
having
asked
you
to
come
here
prefect
no
i
was
coming
just
as
i
promised
you
agazzi
the
police
commissioner
at
the
oh
i
sorry
commissioner
please
come
in
here
have
a
chair
prefect
to
by
the
way
sirelli
they
tell
me
that
you
gone
half
nutty
over
this
blessed
affair
of
our
new
secretary
sirelli
oh
no
governor
believe
me
i
not
the
only
one
the
whole
village
is
worked
up
agazzi
and
that
putting
it
very
mildly
prefect
what
it
all
about
what
it
all
about
good
heavens
agazzi
of
course
governor
you
probably
not
posted
on
the
whole
business
the
old
lady
lives
here
next
door
prefect
yes
i
understand
so
sirelli
no
one
moment
please
governor
you
talked
with
the
poor
old
lady
yet
prefect
i
was
on
my
way
to
see
her
to
i
had
promised
you
to
see
her
here
but
ponza
came
and
begged
me
almost
on
my
knees
to
see
her
in
her
own
house
his
idea
was
to
put
an
end
to
all
this
talk
that
going
around
do
you
think
he
would
have
done
such
a
thing
if
he
were
absolutely
sure
agazzi
of
course
he
sure
because
when
she
talking
in
front
of
him
the
poor
woman
sirelli
getting
in
his
she
says
just
what
he
wants
her
to
say
governor
which
proves
that
she
is
far
from
being
as
insane
as
he
claims
agazzi
we
had
a
sample
of
that
here
yesterday
all
of
us
prefect
why
i
understand
so
you
see
he
trying
all
the
time
to
make
her
believe
he
crazy
he
warned
me
of
that
and
how
else
could
he
keep
the
poor
woman
in
her
illusion
do
you
see
any
way
all
this
talk
of
yours
is
simply
torture
to
the
poor
fellow
believe
me
pure
torture
sirelli
very
well
governor
but
supposing
is
the
one
who
is
trying
to
keep
in
the
idea
that
her
daughter
is
dead
so
as
to
reassure
him
that
his
wife
will
not
be
taken
from
him
again
in
that
case
you
see
governor
it
the
old
lady
who
is
being
tortured
and
not
ponza
agazzi
the
moment
you
see
the
possibility
of
that
governor
well
you
ought
to
hear
her
talk
but
all
by
herself
when
he
not
around
then
you
see
the
possibility
all
right
sirelli
just
as
we
all
see
it
prefect
oh
i
wonder
you
do
seem
to
me
so
awfully
sure
and
for
my
part
i
quite
willing
to
confess
that
i
not
so
sure
myself
how
about
you
laudisi
laudisi
sorry
governor
i
promised
agazzi
here
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
agazzi
nothing
of
the
kind
how
dare
you
say
that
when
the
governor
asks
you
a
plain
question
it
true
i
told
him
not
to
talk
but
do
you
know
why
he
been
doing
his
best
for
the
past
two
days
to
keep
us
all
rattled
so
that
we
ca
find
out
anything
laudisi
do
you
believe
him
governor
on
the
contrary
i
been
doing
my
best
to
bring
these
people
to
common
sense
sirelli
common
sense
and
do
you
know
what
he
calls
common
sense
according
to
him
it
is
not
possible
to
discover
the
truth
and
now
he
been
suggesting
that
ponza
is
living
not
with
a
woman
but
with
a
ghost
prefect
the
that
a
new
one
quite
an
idea
how
do
you
make
that
out
laudisi
agazzi
oh
i
say
you
know
how
he
is
there
no
getting
anywhere
with
him
laudisi
i
leave
it
to
you
governor
i
was
the
one
who
first
suggested
bringing
the
woman
here
prefect
and
do
you
think
laudisi
i
ought
to
see
the
old
lady
next
door
laudisi
no
i
advise
no
such
thing
governor
in
my
judgment
you
are
doing
very
well
in
depending
on
what
ponza
tells
you
prefect
ah
i
see
because
you
too
think
that
ponza
laudisi
no
not
at
all
because
i
also
satisfied
to
have
all
these
people
stand
on
what
signora
frola
says
if
that
does
them
any
good
agazzi
so
you
see
eh
governor
that
what
you
call
arguing
eh
prefect
just
a
moment
let
me
understand
to
so
you
say
we
can
also
trust
what
the
old
lady
says
laudisi
of
course
you
can
implicitly
and
so
you
can
depend
upon
what
ponza
says
implicitly
prefect
excuse
me
i
do
follow
you
sirelli
but
man
alive
if
they
both
say
the
exact
opposite
of
each
other
agazzi
and
with
listen
to
me
governor
please
i
am
prejudiced
neither
in
favor
of
the
old
lady
nor
in
favor
of
ponza
i
recognize
that
he
may
be
right
and
that
she
may
be
right
but
we
ought
to
settle
the
matter
and
there
is
only
one
way
to
do
it
sirelli
the
way
that
laudisi
here
suggested
prefect
he
suggested
it
that
interesting
what
is
it
agazzi
since
we
have
been
able
to
get
any
positive
proof
there
is
only
one
thing
left
you
as
ponza
final
superior
as
the
man
who
can
fire
him
if
need
be
can
obtain
a
statement
from
his
wife
prefect
make
his
wife
talk
you
mean
sirelli
but
not
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
you
understand
agazzi
yes
making
sure
she
tells
the
truth
sirelli
tell
whether
she
the
daughter
of
signora
frola
that
is
as
we
think
she
must
be
agazzi
or
a
second
wife
who
is
consenting
to
impersonate
the
daughter
of
signora
frola
as
ponza
claims
prefect
and
as
i
believe
myself
without
a
shadow
of
doubt
a
why
i
do
see
any
objection
to
having
her
talk
who
could
object
ponza
but
ponza
as
i
know
very
well
is
more
eager
than
anybody
else
to
have
this
talk
quieted
down
he
all
upset
over
this
whole
business
and
said
he
was
willing
to
do
anything
i
proposed
i
sure
he
will
raise
no
objection
so
if
it
will
ease
the
minds
of
you
people
here
say
centuri
police
commissioner
wo
you
just
ask
ponza
to
step
in
here
a
moment
he
next
door
with
his
commissioner
at
once
your
excellency
bows
and
withdraws
through
the
door
at
the
agazzi
oh
well
if
he
consents
prefect
he
consent
all
right
and
we
be
through
with
it
in
a
jiffy
we
bring
her
right
in
here
so
that
you
people
agazzi
here
in
my
house
sirelli
you
think
he
let
his
wife
come
in
here
prefect
just
leave
it
to
me
just
leave
it
to
me
i
prefer
to
have
her
right
here
because
otherwise
you
see
you
people
would
always
suppose
that
i
and
ponza
had
agazzi
oh
please
governor
no
that
not
fair
sirelli
oh
no
governor
we
trust
you
implicitly
prefect
oh
i
not
offended
not
at
all
but
you
know
very
well
that
i
on
his
side
in
this
matter
and
you
always
be
thinking
that
to
hush
up
any
possible
scandal
in
connection
with
a
man
in
my
office
no
you
see
i
must
insist
on
having
the
interview
here
where
your
wife
agazzi
agazzi
in
the
other
room
governor
with
some
other
ladies
prefect
other
ladies
aha
i
see
you
have
a
regular
detective
bureau
here
eh
police
commissioner
enters
with
commissioner
may
i
come
in
signor
ponza
is
here
prefect
thanks
centuri
this
way
ponza
come
right
in
agazzi
have
a
chair
ponza
bows
and
sits
prefect
i
believe
you
know
these
gentlemen
rises
and
agazzi
yes
i
introduced
them
yesterday
and
this
is
laudisi
my
wife
brother
prefect
i
venture
to
disturb
you
my
dear
ponza
just
to
tell
you
that
here
with
these
friends
of
mine
the
first
words
of
the
prefect
ponza
evinces
the
greatest
nervousness
and
prefect
was
there
something
you
wanted
to
say
ponza
ponza
yes
there
is
something
i
want
to
say
governor
i
want
to
present
my
resignation
here
and
now
prefect
oh
my
dear
fellow
i
so
sorry
but
just
a
few
moments
ago
down
at
the
office
you
were
talking
ponza
oh
really
this
is
an
outrage
governor
this
is
just
plain
persecution
plain
persecution
prefect
oh
now
do
take
it
that
way
old
man
see
here
these
good
people
agazzi
persecution
did
you
say
on
my
part
ponza
on
the
part
of
all
of
you
and
i
am
sick
and
tired
of
it
i
am
going
to
resign
governor
i
refuse
to
submit
to
this
ferocious
prying
into
my
private
affairs
which
will
end
by
undoing
a
work
of
love
that
has
cost
me
untold
sacrifice
these
past
two
years
you
do
know
governor
why
treated
that
dear
old
lady
in
there
just
as
tenderly
as
though
she
were
my
own
mother
and
yesterday
i
had
to
shout
at
her
in
the
most
cruel
and
terrible
way
why
i
found
her
just
now
so
worked
up
and
excited
that
agazzi
that
queer
while
she
was
in
here
signora
frola
was
quite
mistress
of
herself
if
anybody
was
worked
up
ponza
it
was
you
and
even
now
if
i
might
say
ponza
but
you
people
do
know
what
you
making
me
go
through
prefect
oh
come
come
my
dear
fellows
do
take
it
so
hard
after
all
i
here
am
i
not
and
you
know
always
stood
by
you
and
i
always
will
ponza
yes
governor
and
i
appreciate
your
kindness
really
prefect
and
then
you
say
that
you
as
fond
of
this
poor
old
lady
as
you
would
be
if
she
were
your
own
mother
well
now
just
remember
that
these
good
people
here
seem
to
be
prying
into
your
affairs
because
they
too
are
fond
of
her
ponza
but
they
killing
her
i
tell
you
governor
they
killing
her
and
i
warned
them
in
advance
prefect
very
well
ponza
very
well
now
we
get
through
with
this
matter
in
no
time
see
here
it
is
all
very
simple
there
is
one
way
that
you
can
convince
these
people
without
the
least
doubt
in
the
world
oh
not
me
i
need
convincing
i
believe
ponza
but
wo
believe
me
no
matter
what
i
say
agazzi
that
not
so
when
you
came
here
after
your
first
visit
and
told
us
that
she
was
insane
all
of
us
well
we
were
surprised
but
we
believed
you
to
the
but
after
he
left
you
understand
the
old
lady
came
back
prefect
yes
yes
i
know
he
told
me
to
ponza
she
came
back
here
and
said
that
she
was
trying
to
do
with
you
exactly
what
you
say
you
were
trying
to
do
with
her
it
natural
is
it
that
people
hearing
both
stories
should
be
somewhat
confused
now
you
see
that
these
good
people
in
view
of
what
your
says
possibly
be
sure
of
what
you
say
so
there
you
are
now
such
being
the
case
you
and
your
why
perfectly
simple
you
two
just
step
aside
now
you
know
you
telling
the
truth
do
you
so
do
i
so
you
possibly
object
to
their
hearing
the
testimony
of
the
only
person
who
does
know
aside
from
you
two
ponza
and
who
may
that
be
pray
prefect
why
your
wife
ponza
my
wife
and
ah
no
i
refuse
never
in
the
world
never
prefect
and
why
not
old
man
ponza
bring
my
wife
here
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
these
strangers
prefect
and
my
curiosity
too
if
you
mind
what
objection
can
you
have
ponza
oh
but
governor
no
my
wife
here
no
why
drag
my
wife
in
these
people
ought
to
believe
me
prefect
but
do
you
see
my
dear
fellow
that
the
course
you
taking
now
is
just
calculated
to
discredit
what
you
say
agazzi
his
mistake
in
the
first
place
governor
was
trying
to
prevent
his
from
coming
here
and
calling
a
double
discourtesy
mark
you
to
my
wife
and
to
my
daughter
ponza
but
what
in
the
name
of
god
do
you
people
want
of
me
you
been
nagging
and
nagging
at
that
poor
old
woman
next
door
and
now
you
want
to
get
your
clutches
on
my
wife
no
governor
i
refuse
to
submit
to
such
an
indignity
she
owes
nothing
to
anybody
my
wife
is
not
making
visits
in
this
town
you
say
you
believe
me
governor
that
enough
for
me
here
my
resignation
i
go
out
and
look
for
another
job
prefect
no
no
ponza
i
must
speak
plainly
in
the
first
place
i
have
always
treated
you
on
the
square
and
you
have
no
right
to
speak
in
that
tone
of
voice
to
me
in
the
second
place
you
are
beginning
to
make
me
doubt
your
word
by
refusing
to
furnish
me
not
other
people
but
me
the
evidence
that
i
have
asked
for
in
your
interest
evidence
moreover
that
so
far
as
i
can
see
can
not
possibly
do
you
any
harm
it
seems
to
me
that
my
colleague
here
signor
agazzi
can
ask
a
lady
to
come
to
his
house
but
no
if
you
prefer
we
go
and
see
her
ponza
so
you
really
insist
governor
prefect
i
insist
but
as
i
told
you
in
your
own
interest
you
realize
besides
that
i
might
have
the
legal
right
to
question
her
ponza
i
see
i
see
so
that
it
an
official
investigation
well
why
not
after
all
i
will
bring
my
wife
here
just
to
end
the
whole
matter
but
how
can
you
guarantee
me
that
this
poor
old
lady
next
door
will
not
catch
sight
of
her
prefect
why
i
had
thought
of
that
she
does
live
right
next
door
agazzi
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
go
to
signor
ponza
house
ponza
no
no
i
was
just
thinking
of
you
people
i
want
you
to
play
any
more
tricks
on
me
any
mistakes
might
have
the
most
frightful
consequences
set
her
going
again
agazzi
you
not
very
fair
to
us
ponza
it
seems
to
me
prefect
or
you
might
bring
your
wife
to
my
office
rather
ponza
no
no
since
you
going
to
question
her
anyway
we
might
as
well
get
through
with
it
we
bring
her
here
right
here
i
keep
an
eye
on
my
myself
we
have
her
here
right
away
governor
and
get
an
end
of
this
nonsense
once
and
for
all
once
and
for
all
hurries
away
through
the
rear
prefect
i
confess
i
was
not
expecting
so
much
opposition
on
his
part
agazzi
ah
you
see
he
go
and
cook
up
with
his
wife
just
what
she
to
say
prefect
oh
do
worry
as
to
that
i
question
the
woman
myself
sirelli
but
he
more
excited
than
he
ever
been
before
prefect
well
i
confess
i
never
saw
him
just
in
this
state
of
mind
perhaps
it
is
the
sense
of
outrage
he
feels
in
having
to
bring
his
wife
sirelli
in
having
to
let
her
loose
for
once
you
ought
to
say
prefect
a
man
is
necessarily
crazy
because
he
wants
to
keep
an
eye
on
his
wife
agazzi
of
course
he
says
it
to
protect
her
from
the
prefect
i
was
thinking
of
just
that
he
may
be
jealous
of
the
woman
sirelli
jealous
to
the
extent
of
refusing
her
a
servant
for
you
know
do
you
he
makes
his
wife
do
all
the
housework
agazzi
and
he
does
all
the
marketing
himself
every
morning
commissioner
that
right
governor
i
had
him
shadowed
an
errand
boy
from
the
market
carries
the
stuff
as
far
as
the
door
sirelli
but
he
never
lets
the
boy
inside
prefect
dear
me
dear
me
he
excused
himself
for
that
servant
business
when
i
took
the
matter
up
with
him
laudisi
and
that
information
right
from
the
source
prefect
he
says
he
does
it
to
save
money
laudisi
he
has
to
keep
two
establishments
on
one
salary
sirelli
oh
we
were
criticising
how
he
runs
his
house
but
i
ask
you
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
he
is
a
man
of
some
position
and
do
you
think
that
this
second
wife
of
his
as
he
calls
her
who
ought
to
be
a
lady
would
consent
to
do
all
the
work
about
the
house
agazzi
the
hardest
and
most
disagreeable
work
you
understand
sirelli
just
out
of
consideration
for
the
mother
of
her
husband
first
wife
agazzi
oh
i
say
governor
be
honest
now
that
seem
probable
does
it
prefect
i
confess
it
does
seem
queer
laudisi
in
case
this
second
woman
is
an
ordinary
woman
prefect
yes
but
let
be
frank
it
does
seem
reasonable
but
yet
one
might
say
well
you
could
explain
it
as
generosity
on
her
part
and
even
better
as
jealousy
on
his
part
lunatic
or
no
lunatic
there
is
no
denying
that
he
jealous
confused
clamor
of
voices
is
heard
from
the
next
agazzi
my
i
wonder
what
going
on
in
there
enters
from
the
door
on
the
left
in
a
state
of
great
amalia
signora
frola
is
here
agazzi
impossible
how
in
the
world
did
she
get
in
who
sent
for
her
amalia

came
of
her
own
accord
prefect
oh
no
please
just
a
moment

her
away
madam

agazzi
we
got
to
get
rid
of
her
do
let
her
in
here

must
absolutely
keep
her
out
frola

at
the
door
on
the
left
trembling
beseeching
weeping
a
handkerchief
in
her
hand
the
people
in
the
next
room
are
crowding
around
behind
signora
frola

while
