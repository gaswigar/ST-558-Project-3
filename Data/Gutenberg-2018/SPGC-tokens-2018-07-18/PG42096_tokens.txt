the
king
of
the
mountains
hermann
schultz
on
the
of
july
about
six
in
the
morning
i
was
watering
my
flowers
a
young
man
entered
the
garden
he
was
blonde
beardless
he
wore
a
german
cap
and
sported
gold
spectacles
a
long
loose
woolen
coat
or
paletot
drooped
in
a
melancholy
way
around
his
form
like
a
sail
around
a
mast
in
a
calm
he
wore
no
gloves
his
tan
leather
shoes
had
such
large
soles
that
the
foot
was
surrounded
by
a
narrow
flange
in
the
of
his
paletot
a
huge
porcelain
pipe
bulged
out
i
did
not
stop
to
ask
myself
whether
this
young
man
was
a
student
in
the
german
universities
i
put
down
my
and
saluted
him
with
guten
morgen
monsieur
he
said
to
me
in
french
but
with
a
deplorable
accent
my
name
is
hermann
schultz
i
have
come
to
pass
some
months
in
greece
and
i
have
carried
your
book
with
me
everywhere
this
praise
penetrated
my
heart
with
sweet
joy
the
stranger
voice
seemed
more
melodious
than
mozart
music
and
i
directed
toward
his
gold
glasses
a
swift
look
of
gratitude
you
would
scarcely
believe
dear
reader
how
much
we
love
those
who
have
taken
the
trouble
to
decipher
our
jargon
as
for
me
if
i
have
ever
sighed
to
be
rich
it
is
in
order
to
assure
an
income
to
all
those
who
have
read
my
works
i
took
him
by
the
hand
this
excellent
young
man
i
seated
him
beside
me
on
the
he
told
me
that
he
was
a
botanist
that
he
had
a
commission
from
the
jardin
des
plantes
in
hamburg
in
order
to
complete
his
herbarium
he
was
studying
the
country
the
animals
and
the
people
his
naive
descriptions
his
terse
but
just
decisions
recalled
to
me
a
little
the
simple
old
herodotus
he
expressed
himself
awkwardly
but
with
a
candor
which
inspired
confidence
he
emphasized
his
words
with
the
tone
of
a
man
entirely
convinced
he
questioned
me
if
not
of
every
one
in
athens
at
least
of
all
the
principal
personages
in
my
book
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
he
made
some
statements
on
general
subjects
which
seemed
to
me
far
more
reasonable
than
any
which
i
had
advanced
at
the
end
of
an
hour
we
had
become
good
friends
i
do
not
know
which
of
us
first
spoke
of
brigandage
people
who
travel
in
italy
talk
of
paintings
those
who
visit
england
talk
of
manufactures
each
country
has
its
specialty
my
dear
sir
i
asked
of
my
guest
have
you
met
any
brigands
is
it
true
as
is
reported
that
there
are
still
bandits
in
greece
it
is
only
too
true
he
gravely
replied
i
was
for
fifteen
days
in
the
hands
of
the
terrible
nicknamed
the
king
of
the
mountains
i
speak
then
from
experience
if
you
have
leisure
and
a
long
story
will
not
weary
you
i
am
ready
to
give
you
the
details
of
my
adventure
you
may
make
of
it
what
you
please
a
romance
a
novel
or
perhaps
an
additional
chapter
in
the
little
book
in
which
you
have
written
so
many
curious
facts
you
are
very
good
i
replied
and
i
am
at
your
disposal
let
us
go
to
my
study
it
is
cooler
there
than
in
the
garden
and
yet
we
can
enjoy
the
odor
of
the
and
mignonette
he
followed
me
humming
to
himself
in
greek
a
popular
song
a
robber
with
black
eyes
descends
to
the
plains
his
gun
is
heard
at
each
step
he
says
to
the
vultures
not
leave
me
i
will
serve
to
you
the
pasha
of
athens
he
seated
himself
on
a
divan
with
his
legs
crossed
under
him
like
the
arabian
took
off
his
loose
paletot
lighted
his
pipe
and
began
his
tale
i
seated
myself
at
my
desk
and
took
stenographic
notes
as
he
dictated
i
have
always
been
without
much
distrust
especially
with
those
who
have
complimented
me
sometimes
the
amiable
stranger
told
me
such
surprising
things
that
i
asked
myself
many
times
if
he
was
not
mocking
me
but
his
manner
was
so
simple
his
blue
eyes
so
limpid
that
my
suspicions
faded
away
on
the
instant
he
talked
steadily
until
half
after
noon
he
stopped
two
or
three
times
only
long
enough
to
relight
his
pipe
he
smoked
with
regular
puffs
like
the
smoke
stack
of
a
each
time
i
raised
my
eyes
i
beheld
him
calm
smiling
in
the
midst
of
a
thick
cloud
of
smoke
like
jupiter
in
the
act
of
amphitryon
we
were
interrupted
by
a
servant
with
the
announcement
that
breakfast
was
served
hermann
seated
himself
opposite
me
and
my
trifling
suspicions
vanished
before
his
appetite
i
said
to
myself
that
a
good
digestion
rarely
accompanies
a
bad
conscience
the
young
german
was
too
good
an
eater
to
be
an
untruthful
narrator
and
his
voracity
restored
my
faith
in
his
veracity
struck
with
this
idea
i
confessed
while
offering
him
some
strawberries
that
i
had
for
an
instant
doubted
him
he
replied
with
an
angelic
smile
i
passed
the
entire
day
with
my
new
friend
and
i
found
that
the
time
did
not
drag
at
five
he
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
put
on
his
outer
coat
and
shaking
my
hand
said
adieu
i
replied
au
revoir
no
he
said
shaking
his
head
i
leave
at
seven
and
i
dare
not
hope
ever
to
see
you
again
leave
your
address
i
have
not
yet
renounced
the
pleasure
of
traveling
and
i
may
sometime
pass
through
hamburg
unfortunately
i
do
not
know
where
i
shall
pitch
my
tent
germany
is
large
i
may
not
remain
a
citizen
of
hamburg
but
if
i
publish
your
story
at
least
i
ought
to
send
you
a
copy
do
not
take
that
trouble
as
soon
as
the
book
is
published
it
will
appear
in
leipzig
and
i
will
read
it
adieu
after
his
departure
i
attentively
what
i
had
written
i
found
some
remarkable
details
but
nothing
which
contradicts
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
during
my
stay
in
greece
at
the
moment
of
finishing
the
manuscript
a
scruple
restrained
me
what
if
some
errors
had
crept
into
hermann
statements
in
my
quality
of
editor
was
i
not
responsible
to
publish
the
story
of
the
king
of
the
mountains
was
it
not
to
expose
myself
to
editorial
comments
and
criticisms
in
my
perplexity
i
thought
of
making
a
copy
of
the
original
i
sent
the
first
to
pseftis
i
begged
him
to
point
out
candidly
all
the
errors
and
i
promised
to
print
his
reply
at
the
end
of
the
volume
i
the
copy
which
i
had
retained
i
changed
no
word
in
it
if
i
made
myself
the
corrector
of
the
young
german
statements
i
would
become
his
collaborator
so
i
discreetly
withdrew
it
is
hermann
who
speaks
to
you
ii
photini
you
divine
from
the
appearance
of
my
clothes
that
i
have
not
ten
thousand
francs
with
me
my
father
is
an
whom
the
railroads
have
ruined
in
prosperous
times
he
eats
bread
in
bad
years
potatoes
add
to
this
that
there
are
six
children
all
with
good
appetites
the
day
on
which
i
received
my
commission
from
the
jardin
des
plantes
there
was
a
festival
given
in
the
family
my
departure
would
not
only
increase
the
portion
of
each
of
my
brothers
but
i
was
to
have
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
per
month
and
the
expenses
for
my
journey
it
was
a
fortune
from
that
moment
they
ceased
to
call
me
doctor
they
dubbed
me
so
that
i
should
appear
rich
my
brothers
prophesied
that
i
would
be
elected
professor
by
the
university
on
my
return
from
athens
my
father
hoped
that
i
would
return
married
in
his
position
of
he
had
assisted
in
some
very
romantic
adventures
he
cited
at
least
three
times
a
week
the
marriage
of
the
princess
ypsoff
and
lieutenant
reynauld
the
princess
occupied
the
finest
apartments
with
her
two
maids
and
her
courier
and
she
gave
twenty
florins
a
day
the
french
lieutenant
was
in
no
way
up
under
the
eaves
and
he
paid
a
florin
and
a
half
food
included
however
after
a
month
sojourn
at
the
hotel
he
departed
in
a
carriage
with
the
russian
lady
my
poor
father
with
the
partiality
of
a
father
thought
that
i
was
handsomer
and
more
elegant
than
lieutenant
reynauld
he
did
not
doubt
but
that
sooner
or
later
i
would
meet
a
princess
who
would
enrich
us
all
if
i
did
not
find
her
at
a
table
i
would
see
her
in
a
railway
carriage
if
the
powers
which
control
the
railroads
were
not
propitious
there
was
still
left
the
steamships
the
evening
of
my
departure
we
drank
a
bottle
of
old
rhine
wine
and
by
chance
the
last
was
poured
into
my
glass
the
good
man
wept
with
joy
it
was
a
sure
sign
and
nothing
could
prevent
me
from
marrying
within
a
year
i
respected
his
superstitions
and
i
refrained
from
saying
that
princesses
rarely
travel
third
class
as
for
lodgings
my
humble
luggage
would
not
permit
me
to
choose
any
but
modest
inns
and
royal
families
do
not
usually
lodge
in
them
the
fact
is
that
i
landed
in
greece
without
an
adventure
of
any
kind
the
army
occupying
the
city
made
everything
very
dear
in
athens
the
hotel
the
hotel
orient
the
hotel
des
etrangers
were
inaccessible
the
chancellor
of
the
prussian
legation
to
whom
i
had
brought
a
letter
of
introduction
was
kind
enough
to
assist
me
in
finding
a
lodging
he
took
me
to
a
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
and
the
place
du
palais
i
found
there
board
and
lodging
for
a
hundred
francs
a
month
christodule
was
an
old
palikar
decorated
with
the
iron
cross
in
memory
of
the
war
of
independence
he
was
a
lieutenant
in
the
phalanx
he
wore
the
national
costume
the
red
bonnet
with
blue
tassel
the
vest
the
white
skirt
and
the
fancy
leggins
when
he
sold
ices
and
cakes
his
wife
maroula
was
enormous
like
all
greek
women
who
have
passed
fifty
her
husband
had
purchased
her
during
the
war
when
women
sold
for
high
prices
she
was
born
in
the
isle
of
hydra
but
she
dressed
in
the
athenian
fashion
upper
garment
or
jacket
of
black
velvet
skirt
of
a
bright
color
a
silk
handkerchief
tied
over
her
head
neither
christodule
nor
his
wife
knew
a
word
of
german
but
their
son
dimitri
who
was
a
servant
hired
by
the
day
and
who
dressed
like
a
frenchman
understood
and
spoke
a
little
of
each
patois
of
europe
upon
the
whole
i
had
really
no
need
of
an
interpreter
without
having
received
the
gift
of
tongues
i
am
a
fairly
good
linguist
and
i
murder
greek
as
readily
as
english
italian
or
french
my
hosts
were
worthy
people
they
gave
me
a
little
room
with
a
table
of
white
wood
two
chairs
a
good
but
thin
mattress
and
some
cotton
quilts
a
wooden
bed
is
a
superfluity
which
the
greeks
easily
deny
themselves
and
we
lived
a
la
grecque
i
breakfasted
on
a
cup
of
i
dined
on
a
plate
of
meat
with
many
olives
and
dry
fish
i
supped
on
vegetables
honey
and
cakes
preserves
were
not
rare
in
the
house
and
occasionally
i
evoked
memories
of
home
by
dining
on
a
leg
of
lamb
and
preserves
it
is
useless
to
tell
you
that
i
had
my
pipe
and
that
the
tobacco
in
athens
is
better
than
yours
that
which
contributed
to
my
feeling
perfectly
at
home
in
house
was
a
light
wine
of
santorin
which
he
bought
i
know
not
where
i
am
not
a
judge
of
wines
and
the
education
of
my
palate
has
unfortunately
been
neglected
but
i
believe
however
that
this
wine
is
worthy
of
a
place
on
a
king
table
it
is
of
a
fine
topaz
color
sparkling
as
the
smile
of
a
child
i
see
it
now
in
its
large
bulging
carafe
on
the
shining
linen
cloth
it
lighted
the
table
and
we
were
able
to
sup
without
any
other
illumination
i
never
drank
much
of
it
because
it
was
heady
and
yet
at
the
end
of
a
meal
i
have
recited
some
of
anacreon
verses
and
i
have
discovered
remains
of
beauty
in
the
face
of
the
gross
maroula
i
ate
with
christodule
and
his
family
there
were
four
regular
boarders
and
one
table
boarder
the
first
floor
was
divided
into
four
rooms
the
best
of
which
was
occupied
by
a
french
archaeologist
hippolyte
mérinay
if
all
frenchmen
resemble
this
one
you
would
be
a
sorry
lot
he
was
very
small
his
age
as
far
as
one
could
tell
anywhere
between
eighteen
and
very
very
mild
very
loquacious
and
never
loosening
his
moist
and
warm
hands
when
he
had
once
fastened
them
on
a
person
until
he
had
exhausted
himself
talking
his
two
dominant
passions
were
archaeology
and
philanthropy
he
was
a
member
of
many
literary
societies
and
of
many
benevolent
associations
although
he
was
an
advocate
of
charity
and
his
parents
had
left
him
a
fine
income
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
seen
him
give
a
sou
to
a
beggar
as
for
his
knowledge
of
archaeology
i
believe
that
it
was
of
more
account
than
his
love
for
humanity
he
had
received
a
prize
from
some
provincial
college
for
a
treatise
on
the
value
of
paper
in
the
time
of
orpheus
encouraged
by
these
first
successes
he
had
come
to
greece
to
gather
material
for
a
more
important
work
it
was
nothing
less
than
to
determine
the
quantity
of
oil
consumed
in
demosthenes
lamp
while
he
wrote
the
second
philippic
my
two
other
neighbors
were
not
so
wise
and
ancient
things
disturbed
them
not
at
all
giacomo
fondi
was
a
poor
maltese
employed
at
i
know
not
what
consulate
he
earned
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
a
month
sealing
letters
i
imagine
that
any
other
employment
would
have
pleased
him
better
nature
who
has
peopled
the
island
of
malta
in
order
that
the
orient
should
never
lack
porters
had
given
to
poor
fondi
the
shoulders
arms
and
hands
of
a
milo
of
crotona
he
was
born
to
handle
a
club
and
not
to
melt
with
which
to
seal
letters
he
used
however
two
or
three
sticks
every
day
man
is
not
the
master
of
his
destiny
the
islander
out
of
his
sphere
was
in
his
element
only
at
he
helped
maroula
to
place
the
table
and
you
will
understand
without
being
told
that
he
always
carried
it
at
he
ate
like
the
hero
of
the
iliad
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
cracking
of
his
huge
jaws
the
dilation
of
his
nostrils
the
flash
of
his
eyes
the
whiteness
of
his
teeth
formidable
of
which
he
was
the
mill
i
ought
to
confess
that
i
remember
little
of
his
conversation
one
easily
found
the
limit
of
his
intelligence
but
one
never
found
the
bounds
of
his
appetite
christodule
had
never
made
anything
during
the
four
years
he
had
boarded
him
although
the
maltese
had
paid
ten
francs
a
month
extra
the
insatiable
islander
ate
every
day
after
dinner
an
enormous
plateful
of
nuts
which
he
cracked
between
his
first
finger
and
thumb
christodule
old
soldier
but
practical
man
followed
this
exercise
with
a
mixture
of
admiration
and
fear
he
trembled
for
his
dessert
yet
he
was
proud
to
see
at
his
table
so
huge
a
the
face
of
giacomo
fondi
would
not
have
been
out
of
place
in
one
of
the
boxes
which
so
amuse
children
it
was
whiter
than
a
negro
but
it
was
a
question
of
shade
only
his
thick
locks
descended
to
his
eyebrows
like
a
cap
in
strange
contrast
this
caliban
had
a
very
small
foot
a
slender
ankle
a
leg
and
as
perfect
as
one
finds
in
a
statue
but
these
were
details
which
one
scarcely
noticed
for
whoever
had
seen
him
eat
his
person
began
at
the
edge
of
the
table
the
rest
of
the
body
counted
for
nothing
i
can
speak
only
from
memory
of
william
lobster
he
was
a
cherub
of
twenty
years
blonde
rosy
and
chubby
but
a
cherub
of
the
united
states
of
america
the
firm
of
lobster
and
sons
new
york
had
sent
him
to
the
orient
to
study
the
subject
of
exportation
he
worked
during
the
day
in
the
house
of
philips
brothers
in
the
evening
he
read
emerson
in
the
early
morning
or
at
sunrise
he
went
to
socrates
school
to
practice
the
most
interesting
person
in
our
little
colony
was
without
doubt
john
harris
the
maternal
uncle
of
the
little
lobster
the
first
time
that
i
dined
with
this
strange
man
i
was
greatly
taken
with
the
american
he
was
born
at
vandalia
illinois
breathing
the
invigorating
air
of
the
new
world
from
his
birth
his
every
movement
was
joyous
i
do
not
know
whether
the
harris
family
was
rich
or
poor
whether
the
son
went
to
college
or
whether
he
educated
himself
what
was
certain
was
that
at
he
relied
on
himself
alone
was
astonished
at
nothing
believed
nothing
impossible
never
flinched
was
amenable
to
reason
hoped
for
the
best
attempted
everything
triumphed
in
everything
if
he
fell
he
immediately
jumped
up
if
he
stammered
he
began
all
over
again
he
gave
himself
no
rest
never
lost
courage
and
went
right
ahead
he
was
had
been
teacher
lawyer
journalist
miner
farmer
clerk
he
had
read
everything
seen
everything
tried
everything
and
had
traveled
over
more
than
half
of
the
globe
when
i
made
his
acquaintance
he
was
commanding
a
carrying
sixty
men
and
four
cannons
he
wrote
of
the
orient
in
the
boston
review
he
transacted
business
with
an
indigo
house
in
calcutta
and
yet
he
found
time
to
come
four
or
five
times
a
week
to
dine
with
his
nephew
lobster
and
with
us
a
single
instance
of
a
thousand
will
serve
to
show
his
character
early
in
the
fifties
he
was
in
business
in
philadelphia
his
nephew
who
was
then
seventeen
made
him
a
visit
he
found
him
near
washington
square
standing
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
before
a
burning
building
william
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
he
turned
ah
bill
thou
hast
arrived
inopportunely
my
boy
there
is
a
fire
which
ruins
me
i
have
forty
thousand
dollars
in
that
house
we
will
not
save
a
match
what
will
you
do
asked
the
astonished
boy
what
will
i
do
it
is
eleven
i
am
hungry
i
have
a
little
money
in
my
pocket
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
breakfast
harris
was
one
of
the
most
slender
and
most
elegant
men
i
have
ever
seen
he
had
a
manly
air
a
fine
forehead
a
clear
and
proud
eye
americans
are
never
deformed
nor
and
do
you
know
why
because
they
are
not
bound
in
the
of
a
narrow
civilization
their
minds
and
their
bodies
develop
at
will
their
schoolroom
is
the
open
air
their
master
exercise
their
nurse
liberty
i
never
cared
especially
for
mérinay
i
looked
at
giacomo
fondi
with
the
indifferent
curiosity
with
which
one
gazes
at
foreign
animals
the
little
lobster
inspired
me
with
interest
but
i
conceived
a
warm
affection
for
harris
his
frank
face
his
simple
manners
his
sternness
which
was
not
without
sweetness
his
hasty
yet
chivalrous
temper
the
oddities
of
his
humor
the
enthusiasm
of
his
sentiments
appealed
to
me
more
strongly
as
i
was
neither
enthusiastic
nor
hasty
we
admire
in
others
what
we
lack
ourselves
giacomo
wore
white
clothes
because
he
was
black
i
adore
americans
because
i
am
a
german
as
for
the
greeks
i
knew
little
of
them
even
after
four
months
sojourn
in
their
country
nothing
is
easier
than
living
in
athens
without
coming
in
contact
with
the
natives
i
did
not
go
to
a
café
i
did
not
read
the
pandore
nor
the
minerve
nor
any
other
paper
of
the
country
i
did
not
go
to
the
theater
because
i
have
a
sensitive
ear
and
a
false
note
hurts
me
more
cruelly
than
a
blow
i
lived
with
my
hosts
my
herbarium
and
with
john
harris
i
could
have
presented
myself
at
the
palace
thanks
to
my
diplomatic
and
my
official
title
i
had
sent
my
card
to
the
master
and
mistress
of
ceremonies
and
i
could
count
upon
an
invitation
to
the
first
court
ball
i
kept
in
reserve
for
this
occasion
a
beautiful
red
coat
embroidered
with
silver
which
my
aunt
rosenthaler
had
given
to
me
the
night
before
my
departure
it
was
her
uniform
he
was
an
assistant
in
a
scientific
institute
and
prepared
the
specimens
my
good
aunt
a
woman
of
great
sense
knew
that
a
uniform
was
well
received
in
all
countries
above
all
if
it
was
red
my
elder
brother
had
remarked
that
i
was
larger
than
my
uncle
as
the
sleeves
were
too
short
but
papa
quickly
replied
that
only
the
silver
embroidery
would
catch
the
eye
and
that
princesses
would
not
examine
the
uniform
closely
unfortunately
the
court
was
not
dancing
that
season
the
winter
pleasures
were
the
flowering
of
almond
peach
and
lemon
trees
there
was
a
vague
report
of
a
ball
to
be
given
the
of
may
it
made
a
stir
in
the
city
as
a
few
journals
took
it
up
but
there
was
nothing
positively
known
about
it
my
studies
kept
pace
with
my
pleasures
slowly
i
knew
by
heart
the
botanical
gardens
of
athens
they
were
neither
very
beautiful
nor
very
full
it
was
a
subject
soon
mastered
the
royal
gardens
offered
far
more
to
study
an
intelligent
frenchman
had
collected
for
it
all
the
riches
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
from
the
palms
of
the
west
indies
to
the
saxifrage
of
the
north
i
passed
whole
days
there
studying
barraud
collections
the
garden
is
public
only
at
certain
hours
but
i
spoke
greek
to
the
guards
and
for
love
of
the
greek
they
permitted
me
to
enter
barraud
did
not
seem
to
weary
of
my
company
he
took
me
everywhere
for
the
pleasure
of
discussing
botany
and
speaking
french
in
his
absence
i
hunted
up
the
head
gardener
and
questioned
him
in
german
it
is
well
to
be
polyglot
i
searched
for
plants
every
day
in
the
surrounding
country
but
never
as
far
from
the
city
as
i
should
like
to
have
gone
there
were
many
brigands
around
athens
i
am
not
a
coward
the
following
story
will
prove
it
to
you
but
i
love
my
life
it
is
a
present
which
i
received
from
my
parents
i
wish
to
preserve
it
as
long
as
possible
in
remembrance
of
my
father
and
mother
in
the
month
of
april
it
was
dangerous
to
go
far
from
the
city
it
was
even
imprudent
to
live
outside
i
did
not
venture
upon
the
slopes
of
lycabettus
without
thinking
of
poor
mme
daraud
who
was
robbed
in
broad
daylight
the
hills
of
daphne
recalled
to
me
the
capture
of
two
french
officers
upon
the
road
to
piraeus
i
thought
involuntarily
of
the
band
of
brigands
who
traveled
in
six
carriages
as
if
on
a
pleasure
tour
and
who
shot
at
passers
by
from
the
coach
doors
the
road
to
pentelicus
recalled
the
stopping
of
the
duchess
de
plaisance
or
the
recent
story
of
harris
and
lobster
adventure
they
were
returning
from
an
excursion
on
two
persian
horses
belonging
to
harris
when
they
fell
into
an
ambuscade
two
brigands
weapons
in
hand
stopped
them
in
the
middle
of
a
bridge
they
glanced
all
around
and
saw
at
their
feet
in
a
ravine
a
dozen
rascals
armed
to
the
teeth
who
were
guarding
fifty
or
sixty
prisoners
all
who
had
passed
that
way
since
sunrise
had
been
despoiled
then
bound
so
that
no
one
could
escape
to
give
the
alarm
harris
and
his
nephew
were
unarmed
harris
said
to
the
young
man
in
english
give
up
your
money
it
will
not
pay
to
be
killed
for
twenty
dollars
the
brigands
took
the
money
without
letting
go
the
bridles
they
then
showed
the
americans
the
ravine
and
signed
to
them
to
descend
harris
now
lost
patience
it
was
repugnant
to
him
to
be
bound
he
was
not
the
kind
of
wood
of
which
one
makes
fagots
he
looked
at
the
little
lobster
and
at
the
same
instant
two
fist
blows
like
two
struck
the
heads
of
the
two
brigands
william
adversary
fell
over
on
his
back
at
the
same
time
discharging
his
pistol
harris
brigand
struck
more
forcibly
toppled
over
the
cliff
and
fell
among
his
comrades
harris
and
lobster
were
by
this
time
quite
a
distance
away
jamming
the
spurs
into
their
horses
the
band
rose
as
one
man
and
discharged
their
weapons
the
horses
were
killed
the
young
men
disengaged
themselves
took
to
their
heels
and
when
they
reached
the
city
warned
the
police
who
started
in
pursuit
of
the
brigands
the
second
morning
after
our
excellent
christodule
learned
with
grief
of
the
death
of
the
two
horses
but
he
found
not
a
word
of
blame
for
the
killers
what
would
you
have
he
asked
with
charming
simplicity
it
is
their
business
all
greeks
are
more
or
less
of
our
host
opinion
it
is
not
that
the
brigands
spare
their
countrymen
and
reserve
their
harshness
for
strangers
but
a
greek
robbed
by
his
brother
says
to
himself
with
a
certain
resignation
that
the
money
is
all
in
the
family
the
populace
sees
itself
plundered
by
the
brigands
as
a
woman
of
the
people
who
is
beaten
by
her
husband
admires
him
because
he
strikes
hard
native
moralists
complained
of
the
excesses
committed
in
the
country
as
a
father
deplores
his
son
pranks
he
groans
loudly
but
secretly
admires
him
he
would
be
ashamed
if
he
was
like
his
neighbor
son
who
never
had
to
be
spoken
to
it
was
a
fact
that
at
the
time
of
my
arrival
the
hero
of
athens
was
the
scourge
of
attica
in
the
salons
and
in
the
cafés
in
the
where
the
common
people
congregated
at
the
pharmacies
where
the
bourgeoise
were
to
be
found
in
the
muddy
streets
of
the
bazars
in
the
dusty
square
of
at
the
theater
at
the
sunday
concerts
and
upon
the
road
to
patissia
one
heard
only
of
the
great
one
swore
only
by
the
invincible
the
terror
of
the
police
the
king
of
the
mountains
they
almost
composed
god
pardon
me
a
litany
on
one
sunday
a
little
while
after
his
adventure
john
harris
dined
with
us
i
started
christodule
upon
the
subject
of
our
host
had
often
visited
him
years
before
during
the
war
of
independence
when
brigandage
was
less
discussed
than
now
he
emptied
his
glass
of
sautorin
stroked
his
gray
mustache
and
began
a
long
recital
interspersed
with
many
sighs
he
informed
us
that
stavros
was
the
son
of
a
bishop
or
priest
of
the
greek
church
in
the
island
of
tino
he
was
born
god
knew
in
what
year
greeks
of
early
times
knew
not
their
ages
because
registries
of
the
civil
state
are
an
invention
of
the
decadence
his
father
who
destined
him
for
the
church
taught
him
to
read
when
about
twenty
years
of
age
he
made
a
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
and
added
to
his
name
the
title
hadgi
which
means
pilgrim
returning
to
his
own
country
was
taken
prisoner
by
a
pirate
the
conqueror
found
him
amenable
to
reason
and
made
a
sailor
of
him
thus
he
began
to
make
war
on
turkish
ships
and
generally
on
those
which
had
not
mounted
guns
at
the
end
of
several
years
he
tired
of
working
for
others
and
determined
to
push
out
for
himself
he
possessed
neither
boat
nor
money
to
buy
one
necessity
compelled
him
to
practice
piracy
on
land
the
rising
of
the
greeks
against
turkey
permitted
him
to
fish
in
troubled
waters
he
never
could
tell
exactly
whether
he
was
a
brigand
or
an
insurgent
whether
he
commanded
a
band
of
thieves
or
insurrectionists
his
hatred
of
the
turks
did
not
blind
him
to
the
degree
that
he
could
pass
a
greek
village
without
seeing
it
and
sacking
it
all
money
was
good
to
him
whether
it
came
from
friend
or
foe
from
a
simple
theft
or
a
glorious
pillage
such
wise
impartiality
rapidly
increased
his
fortune
the
shepherds
hastened
to
place
themselves
under
his
banner
when
they
learned
that
good
pay
might
be
expected
his
reputation
brought
him
an
army
the
leaders
of
the
insurrection
knew
of
his
exploits
but
not
of
his
thrift
in
those
times
one
saw
only
the
bright
side
of
everything
lord
byron
dedicated
an
ode
to
him
poets
and
orators
in
paris
compared
him
to
epaminondas
and
even
to
poor
aristides
some
sent
him
embroidered
clothes
from
the
faubourg
others
sent
subsidies
he
received
money
from
france
from
england
and
from
russia
i
will
not
swear
that
he
never
received
any
from
turkey
he
was
a
true
palikar
at
the
end
of
the
war
he
was
besieged
with
other
chiefs
in
the
acropolis
at
athens
he
slept
in
the
propyleum
between
margaritis
and
lygandas
and
each
had
his
treasure
hid
in
the
blanket
which
covered
him
one
summer
night
the
roof
fell
so
cleverly
that
it
killed
every
one
but
who
was
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
open
air
he
secured
his
companions
money
and
every
one
thought
that
he
well
deserved
it
but
a
misfortune
which
he
had
not
foreseen
checked
his
successful
career
peace
was
declared
retired
to
the
country
with
his
spoils
and
became
a
spectator
of
strange
occurrences
the
powers
which
had
freed
greece
attempted
to
found
a
kingdom
some
offensive
words
came
buzzing
around
the
hairy
ears
of
the
old
robber
he
heard
rumors
of
government
of
armies
of
public
order
he
laughed
when
told
that
his
possessions
were
included
in
one
but
when
an
employée
from
the
treasury
presented
himself
to
collect
the
yearly
taxes
he
became
serious
he
threw
the
man
out
of
the
door
not
without
having
relieved
him
of
all
he
had
brought
with
him
justice
sought
to
punish
him
he
took
to
the
mountains
it
was
as
well
for
he
was
tired
of
his
house
he
felt
to
a
certain
extent
that
he
owned
a
roof
but
on
condition
that
he
slept
above
it
his
former
had
scattered
all
over
the
kingdom
the
state
had
given
them
lands
they
cultivated
them
reluctantly
and
ate
sparingly
of
the
bitter
bread
of
labor
when
they
learned
that
their
chief
was
at
variance
with
the
law
they
sold
their
farms
and
hastened
to
join
him
as
for
the
brigand
he
rented
his
lands
he
had
the
qualifications
of
an
administrator
peace
and
idleness
had
made
him
ill
and
unhappy
the
mountain
air
restored
his
cheerfulness
and
health
so
that
in
he
thought
of
marriage
he
was
assuredly
past
fifty
but
men
of
his
temper
have
nothing
to
do
with
old
age
death
even
looks
at
them
twice
before
it
attacks
them
he
married
an
heiress
with
a
magnificent
dowry
from
one
of
the
best
families
in
laconia
and
thus
became
allied
to
the
highest
personages
of
the
kingdom
his
wife
followed
him
everywhere
after
giving
birth
to
a
daughter
she
took
a
fever
and
died
he
brought
up
the
child
himself
with
all
the
care
and
tenderness
of
a
mother
when
the
brigands
saw
him
dancing
the
babe
on
his
knees
they
exclaimed
with
admiration
paternal
love
gave
a
new
impetus
to
his
mind
in
order
to
amass
a
royal
dowry
for
his
daughter
he
studied
the
money
question
about
which
he
had
previously
held
very
primitive
views
instead
of
hoarding
up
his
treasures
in
strong
boxes
he
put
them
out
at
interest
he
learned
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
speculation
he
followed
closely
the
at
home
and
abroad
it
is
asserted
that
struck
with
the
advantages
of
the
french
company
he
even
thought
of
placing
brigandage
on
the
market
he
made
many
journeys
to
europe
in
the
company
of
a
greek
from
marseilles
who
served
as
interpreter
during
his
stay
in
england
he
assisted
at
an
election
in
i
know
not
what
rotten
borough
of
yorkshire
this
beautiful
spectacle
inspired
him
with
profound
reflections
on
constitutional
government
and
its
profits
he
returned
to
greece
determined
to
exploit
his
theories
and
gain
an
income
for
himself
he
burned
a
goodly
number
of
villages
in
the
service
of
the
opposition
he
destroyed
a
few
others
in
the
interests
of
the
conservative
party
when
it
was
considered
desirable
to
overthrow
a
ministry
it
was
only
necessary
to
apply
to
him
he
proved
conclusively
that
the
police
were
very
corrupt
and
that
safety
could
only
be
obtained
by
changing
the
cabinet
but
in
revenge
he
gave
some
rude
lessons
to
the
enemies
of
order
in
punishing
them
in
whatever
way
they
had
sinned
his
political
talents
made
him
so
well
known
that
all
parties
held
him
in
high
esteem
his
counsels
his
election
methods
were
nearly
always
followed
so
well
that
contrary
to
the
principle
of
the
government
representative
who
wished
one
deputy
to
express
the
wishes
of
many
men
he
was
represented
he
alone
by
about
thirty
deputies
an
intelligent
minister
the
celebrated
rhalettis
suggested
that
a
man
who
meddles
so
officiously
in
government
affairs
might
possibly
sometime
derange
the
machine
he
undertook
to
bind
his
hands
with
golden
cord
he
made
an
arrangement
to
meet
him
at
carvati
between
hymettus
and
pentelicus
in
the
of
a
foreign
consul
came
without
escort
and
without
arms
the
minister
and
the
brigand
who
were
old
acquaintances
breakfasted
together
like
two
old
friends
at
the
end
of
the
meal
rhalettis
offered
to
him
full
amnesty
for
himself
and
his
followers
a
brevet
of
general
of
division
title
of
senator
and
ten
thousand
hectares
of
forests
the
palikar
hesitated
some
time
and
at
last
said
i
should
perhaps
have
accepted
at
twenty
but
i
am
too
old
i
do
not
wish
at
my
age
to
change
my
manner
of
living
dusty
athens
does
not
please
me
i
should
go
to
sleep
in
the
and
if
you
should
give
me
soldiers
to
command
i
might
discharge
my
pistols
into
their
uniforms
from
force
of
habit
return
then
to
your
own
affairs
and
leave
me
to
attend
to
mine
rhalettis
would
not
own
that
he
was
beaten
he
tried
to
enlighten
the
brigand
as
to
the
infamy
of
his
life
laughed
and
said
with
amiability
my
friend
the
day
when
we
shall
write
down
our
sins
which
will
have
the
longest
list
you
think
then
that
you
will
cheat
destiny
you
will
die
some
day
or
other
a
violent
death
gracious
lord
allah
kerin
he
replied
in
turkish
neither
you
nor
i
have
read
the
stars
but
i
have
at
least
one
advantage
my
enemies
wear
a
uniform
and
i
recognize
them
afar
off
you
can
not
say
as
much
for
yours
adieu
brother
six
months
afterward
the
minister
was
assassinated
by
political
enemies
the
brigand
still
lived
our
host
did
not
relate
to
us
all
the
exploits
of
his
hero
the
day
was
not
long
enough
he
contented
himself
by
relating
the
most
remarkable
ones
i
do
not
believe
that
in
any
other
country
the
rivals
of
had
ever
done
anything
more
artistic
than
the
capture
of
the
niebuhr
it
was
a
steamer
of
the
which
the
palikar
had
robbed
on
land
at
eleven
in
the
morning
the
niebuhr
came
from
constantinople
it
unloaded
its
cargo
and
passengers
at
calamaki
east
of
the
isthmus
of
corinth
four
vans
and
two
omnibusses
took
the
passengers
and
merchandise
to
the
other
side
of
the
isthmus
to
the
little
port
of
loutraki
where
another
ship
awaited
them
it
waited
a
long
time
in
broad
daylight
in
plain
view
of
all
the
world
in
a
flat
and
open
country
relieved
them
of
their
merchandise
their
luggage
their
money
and
the
ammunition
of
the
soldiers
who
escorted
the
company
that
day
work
brought
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
said
christodule
to
us
in
a
tone
of
envy
much
was
said
of
cruelties
his
friend
christodule
proved
to
us
that
he
did
not
do
wrong
for
pleasure
he
was
a
sober
man
who
never
became
intoxicated
not
even
of
blood
if
it
happened
that
he
warmed
a
little
too
much
a
rich
peasant
feet
it
was
that
he
might
learn
where
the
miser
hid
his
écus
in
general
he
treated
with
kindness
the
prisoners
for
whom
he
hoped
to
receive
a
ransom
in
the
summer
of
he
descended
one
evening
with
his
band
to
house
he
was
a
rich
merchant
from
the
isle
of
euboea
he
found
the
family
assembled
also
an
old
judge
of
the
tribunal
of
chalcis
was
present
taking
a
hand
at
cards
with
the
master
of
the
house
offered
to
play
the
magistrate
for
his
liberty
he
lost
and
accepted
with
good
grace
he
carried
off
voidi
his
daughter
and
son
he
left
the
wife
that
she
might
busy
herself
procuring
the
ransom
the
day
of
the
attack
the
merchant
had
the
gout
the
daughter
was
ill
of
a
fever
and
the
son
was
pale
and
puffy
they
returned
two
months
afterward
cured
by
exercise
the
open
air
and
good
entertainment
the
whole
family
recovered
health
for
a
sum
of
fifty
thousand
francs
was
it
paying
too
high
a
price
i
confess
added
christodule
that
our
friend
was
without
pity
for
poor
payers
when
a
ransom
was
not
paid
on
the
appointed
day
he
promptly
killed
his
prisoners
it
was
his
way
of
protesting
notes
however
great
may
be
my
admiration
for
him
however
warm
the
friendship
between
our
two
families
i
have
never
pardoned
him
the
murder
of
mistra
two
little
daughters
they
were
twins
of
fourteen
pretty
as
two
marble
statues
both
betrothed
to
two
young
men
of
the
leondari
family
they
resembled
each
other
so
exactly
that
one
thought
one
saw
double
and
began
to
rub
one
eyes
one
morning
they
went
to
sell
cocoons
they
carried
between
them
a
large
basket
and
they
skimmed
lightly
over
the
road
like
two
doves
attached
to
the
same
car
took
them
to
the
mountain
and
wrote
a
letter
to
their
mother
that
he
would
return
them
for
ten
thousand
francs
payable
the
end
of
the
month
the
mother
was
a
owner
of
fine
mulberry
groves
but
poor
in
ready
money
as
we
all
are
she
mortgaged
her
property
which
is
never
easy
to
do
even
at
twenty
per
cent
interest
it
took
her
six
weeks
to
gather
up
the
sum
required
when
at
last
she
had
the
money
she
loaded
it
on
her
mule
and
departed
on
foot
for
the
brigand
camp
but
on
entering
the
large
valley
of
the
taygète
at
the
point
where
one
finds
seven
fountains
under
a
the
mule
absolutely
refused
to
stir
then
the
mother
saw
at
the
border
of
the
path
her
little
girls
their
throats
had
been
cut
and
their
pretty
heads
were
almost
dissevered
she
took
the
two
poor
creatures
put
them
herself
upon
the
mule
back
and
carried
them
back
to
mistra
she
never
wept
she
became
deranged
and
died
i
know
that
regretted
what
he
had
done
he
believed
that
the
widow
was
richer
than
she
pretended
and
that
she
did
not
wish
to
pay
he
killed
the
two
girls
as
an
example
it
is
certain
that
from
that
time
his
outstanding
debts
were
promptly
paid
and
that
no
one
dared
to
make
him
wait
vile
beast
cried
giacomo
bringing
his
fist
down
with
a
force
which
made
the
house
tremble
as
from
an
earthquake
if
ever
he
falls
under
my
hand
i
will
serve
him
with
a
ransom
of
ten
thousand
blows
of
the
fist
which
will
enable
him
to
withdraw
himself
from
public
life
i
said
the
little
lobster
with
his
quiet
smile
i
will
only
ask
to
meet
him
at
fifty
paces
from
my
revolver
and
you
uncle
john
harris
whistled
between
his
teeth
a
little
american
air
sharp
as
a
stiletto
point
can
i
believe
my
ears
added
the
good
mérinay
in
his
voice
is
it
possible
that
such
horrors
are
committed
in
a
country
like
ours
i
am
convinced
that
the
society
for
the
moralization
of
malefactors
has
not
yet
been
organized
in
this
kingdom
but
while
waiting
for
that
have
you
not
police
certainly
replied
christodule
fifty
officers
sergeants
and
policemen
of
whom
are
mounted
it
is
the
finest
band
of
men
in
the
kingdom
after
that
belonging
to
what
astonishes
me
i
said
in
my
turn
is
that
the
old
daughter
allows
him
to
do
such
things
she
does
not
live
with
him
well
and
good
where
is
she
at
a
in
athens
you
ask
too
much
i
have
known
nothing
of
her
for
some
time
whoever
marries
her
will
receive
a
fine
dowry
with
her
yes
said
harris
one
can
say
as
well
that
calcraft
daughter
is
a
good
match
who
is
calcraft
the
headsman
of
london
at
these
words
dimitri
christodule
son
reddened
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
pardon
monsieur
he
said
to
john
harris
there
is
a
great
difference
between
a
headsman
and
a
brigand
the
business
of
a
headsman
is
infamous
the
profession
of
a
brigand
is
honored
the
government
is
obliged
to
guard
the
headsman
of
athens
in
the
fort
palamede
or
he
would
be
assassinated
while
no
one
wishes
evil
to
and
the
most
respectable
people
in
the
kingdom
would
be
proud
to
shake
hands
with
him
harris
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
when
the
shop
bell
rung
it
was
the
servant
who
had
entered
with
a
young
girl
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
dressed
like
the
latest
in
the
journal
des
modes
dimitri
said
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
it
is
photini
messieurs
said
the
talk
of
something
else
if
you
please
histories
of
brigands
are
not
for
young
girls
to
hear
christodule
presented
photini
to
us
as
the
daughter
of
one
of
his
colonel
jean
commanding
at
nauplie
she
called
herself
then
photini
daughter
of
jean
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
where
there
were
properly
speaking
no
family
names
the
young
maid
was
ugly
as
were
of
the
athenian
girls
she
had
pretty
teeth
and
beautiful
hair
but
that
was
all
her
body
did
not
look
well
in
a
parisian
corset
her
feet
which
were
large
thick
and
were
made
for
wearing
turkish
slippers
and
not
to
be
compressed
into
the
shoes
of
the
fashionable
meyer
she
was
as
as
if
an
imprudent
nurse
had
committed
the
fault
of
sitting
down
on
her
face
when
an
infant
fashion
is
not
becoming
to
all
women
it
made
the
poor
photini
almost
ridiculous
her
flounced
dress
extended
over
a
huge
crinoline
accentuated
the
clumsiness
of
her
body
and
the
awkwardness
of
her
movements
jewels
from
the
palais
royal
with
which
she
was
decked
seemed
like
exclamation
points
destined
to
point
out
the
imperfections
of
her
body
you
would
have
said
that
she
was
a
stout
and
coarse
masquerading
in
her
clothes
we
were
not
astonished
to
see
the
daughter
of
a
simple
colonel
so
extravagantly
and
gorgeously
arrayed
come
to
pass
sunday
at
a
we
knew
enough
of
the
country
to
fully
realize
that
dress
was
the
incurable
evil
of
greek
society
country
girls
pierced
silver
pieces
strung
them
together
and
wore
them
upon
the
head
on
gala
days
they
carried
their
dowries
on
their
heads
the
city
girls
spent
their
money
in
the
shops
and
carried
their
dowries
on
their
backs
photini
was
in
a
at
hétairie
it
is
as
you
know
a
school
established
on
the
model
of
the
legion
of
honor
but
regulated
by
rules
broader
and
more
tolerant
usually
only
daughters
of
soldiers
were
taught
there
sometimes
also
brigands
heiresses
colonel
jean
daughter
knew
a
little
french
and
a
little
english
but
her
timidity
did
not
permit
of
her
shining
in
conversation
i
learned
later
that
her
family
counted
upon
us
to
perfect
her
in
these
foreign
tongues
her
father
having
learned
that
christodule
boarded
honorable
and
educated
europeans
had
begged
the
to
allow
her
to
pass
her
sundays
with
his
family
and
he
would
see
that
he
was
recompensed
this
bargain
pleased
christodule
and
above
all
his
son
dimitri
the
young
man
working
in
a
servant
place
devoured
her
with
his
eyes
while
the
heiress
never
perceived
it
we
had
made
arrangements
to
go
all
together
to
a
concert
it
is
a
fine
spectacle
when
the
athenians
give
themselves
up
to
sunday
pleasures
the
entire
population
in
gala
dress
turns
out
into
the
dusty
fields
to
hear
waltzes
and
quadrilles
played
by
a
regiment
band
the
poor
go
on
foot
the
rich
in
carriages
the
fashionable
men
on
horseback
the
court
would
not
have
stayed
away
for
an
empire
after
the
last
quadrille
each
returned
to
his
home
clothes
covered
with
dust
but
with
happy
hearts
and
said
we
have
been
very
well
amused
it
was
certain
that
photini
counted
on
showing
herself
at
the
concert
and
her
admirer
dimitri
was
not
ashamed
to
appear
with
her
for
he
wore
a
new
redingote
which
he
had
just
bought
at
the
unfortunately
it
rained
so
steadily
that
it
kept
us
at
home
to
kill
time
maroula
offered
to
let
us
play
for
bonbons
it
is
a
favorite
amusement
among
the
middle
classes
she
took
a
glass
jar
from
the
shop
and
gave
to
each
one
a
handful
of
native
bonbons
cloves
anise
seed
pepper
and
chicory
then
the
cards
were
dealt
and
the
first
who
collected
nine
of
the
same
color
received
three
sugar
plums
from
each
of
his
adversaries
the
maltese
giacomo
showed
by
his
eagerness
that
the
winning
was
not
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
chance
favored
him
he
made
a
fortune
and
we
saw
him
gulp
down
six
or
eight
handfuls
of
bonbons
which
he
had
won
from
the
rest
of
us
i
took
little
interest
in
the
game
and
concentrated
my
attention
upon
the
curious
phenomenon
taking
place
on
my
left
while
the
glances
which
the
young
athenian
dimitri
cast
upon
photini
were
met
with
perfect
indifference
harris
who
did
not
even
look
at
her
seemed
to
produce
a
wonderful
impression
upon
her
even
to
almost
magnetize
her
he
held
his
cards
with
a
nonchalant
air
yawning
from
time
to
time
with
american
freedom
or
whistling
yankee
doodle
without
respect
for
the
company
i
believe
that
christodule
story
had
made
a
great
impression
on
him
and
that
his
thoughts
were
roving
over
the
mountains
in
pursuit
of
in
any
case
whatever
his
thoughts
were
they
were
not
of
love
perhaps
the
young
girl
was
not
thinking
of
it
either
for
greek
women
nearly
always
have
in
their
hearts
a
substratum
of
indifference
she
looked
at
my
friend
john
as
a
lark
looks
at
a
mirror
she
did
not
know
him
she
knew
nothing
of
him
neither
his
name
his
country
nor
his
fortune
she
had
not
heard
him
speak
and
even
if
she
had
heard
him
she
certainly
was
not
competent
to
judge
of
his
ability
she
saw
that
he
was
very
handsome
and
that
was
enough
formerly
greeks
adored
beauty
it
was
the
only
one
of
their
duties
which
had
never
had
any
atheists
the
greeks
of
despite
the
decadence
know
how
to
distinguish
an
apollo
from
a
baboon
one
finds
in
fauriel
collection
a
little
song
which
may
be
translated
thus
young
man
do
you
wish
to
know
young
girls
would
you
like
to
learn
how
love
enters
into
our
hearts
it
enters
by
the
eyes
from
the
eyes
it
descends
to
the
heart
and
in
the
heart
it
takes
root
decidedly
photini
knew
the
song
for
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
so
that
love
could
enter
without
trouble
the
rain
did
not
cease
to
fall
nor
dimitri
to
ogle
the
young
girl
nor
the
young
girl
to
gaze
at
harris
nor
giacomo
to
eat
bonbons
nor
mérinay
to
relate
to
the
little
lobster
who
did
not
listen
a
chapter
from
ancient
history
at
eight
maroula
laid
the
cloth
for
supper
photini
had
dimitri
on
her
left
i
sat
at
her
right
she
talked
but
little
and
ate
nothing
at
dessert
when
the
servant
spoke
of
taking
her
home
she
made
a
great
effort
and
said
to
me
in
a
low
tone
is
harris
married
i
took
a
wicked
pleasure
in
embarrassing
her
a
little
so
i
replied
yes
mademoiselle
he
married
the
widow
of
the
doges
of
venice
is
it
possible
how
old
is
she
she
is
as
old
as
the
world
and
as
everlasting
do
not
mock
me
i
am
a
poor
foolish
girl
and
i
do
not
understand
your
european
pleasantries
in
other
words
mademoiselle
he
is
wedded
to
the
sea
it
is
he
who
commands
the
american
boat
fancy
stationed
here
she
thanked
me
with
such
a
flash
of
radiant
joy
passing
over
her
face
that
her
ugliness
was
eclipsed
and
i
thought
she
looked
absolutely
pretty
iii
the
studies
of
my
youth
have
developed
in
me
one
passion
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
the
desire
to
know
or
if
you
like
the
term
better
call
it
curiosity
from
the
day
when
i
embarked
for
athens
my
only
pleasure
was
to
learn
my
only
grief
ignorance
i
loved
science
ardently
and
no
one
as
yet
had
disputed
her
claim
in
my
heart
i
must
confess
that
i
had
little
tenderness
and
that
poetry
and
hermann
schultz
rarely
entered
the
same
door
i
went
about
the
world
as
in
a
vast
museum
magnifying
glass
in
hand
i
observed
the
pleasures
and
sufferings
of
others
as
emotions
worthy
of
study
but
unworthy
of
envy
or
pity
i
was
no
more
jealous
of
a
happy
household
than
of
two
palm
trees
with
branches
interlaced
by
the
wind
i
had
just
as
much
compassion
for
a
heart
torn
by
love
as
i
had
for
a
geranium
ruined
by
the
frost
when
one
has
practiced
vivisection
one
is
no
longer
sensitive
to
the
quivering
of
the
flesh
i
would
have
been
a
good
spectator
at
a
combat
of
gladiators
photini
love
for
harris
would
have
aroused
pity
in
any
heart
but
a
naturalist
the
poor
creature
loved
at
random
to
quote
a
beautiful
saying
of
henry
iv
and
it
was
evident
that
she
loved
hopelessly
she
was
too
timid
to
display
her
affection
and
john
was
too
indifferent
to
divine
it
even
if
he
had
noticed
anything
what
hope
was
there
that
he
would
feel
any
interest
in
an
ugly
greek
girl
photini
passed
four
days
with
us
the
four
sundays
of
april
she
looked
at
harris
from
morning
to
night
with
loving
but
despairing
eyes
but
she
never
found
the
courage
to
open
her
mouth
in
his
presence
harris
whistled
tranquilly
dimitri
growled
like
a
young
and
i
smilingly
looked
on
at
this
strange
malady
from
which
my
constitution
had
preserved
me
in
the
meantime
my
father
had
written
me
that
his
affairs
were
not
going
well
that
travelers
were
scarce
that
food
was
dear
that
our
neighbors
were
about
to
emigrate
and
that
if
i
had
found
a
russian
princess
i
had
better
marry
her
without
delay
i
replied
that
i
had
not
as
yet
found
one
unless
it
was
the
daughter
of
a
poor
greek
colonel
that
she
was
seriously
in
love
not
with
me
but
with
another
that
i
could
by
paying
her
a
little
attention
become
her
confidant
but
that
i
should
never
become
her
husband
moreover
my
health
was
good
and
my
herbarium
magnificent
my
researches
hitherto
restricted
to
the
suburbs
of
athens
would
now
become
more
extended
safety
was
assured
the
brigands
had
been
beaten
by
the
soldiers
and
all
the
journals
announced
the
dispersion
of
band
a
month
or
two
later
i
should
be
able
to
set
out
for
germany
and
find
a
place
which
would
pay
enough
to
support
the
whole
family
we
had
read
on
sunday
the
of
april
in
the
siècle
of
athens
of
the
complete
defeat
of
the
king
of
the
mountains
the
official
reports
stated
that
he
had
twenty
men
wounded
his
camp
burned
his
band
dispersed
and
that
the
troops
had
pursued
him
as
far
as
the
marshes
near
marathon
these
reports
very
agreeable
to
all
strangers
did
not
appear
to
give
much
pleasure
to
the
greeks
and
especially
to
our
host
and
hostess
christodule
for
a
lieutenant
of
troops
showed
lack
of
enthusiasm
and
colonel
jean
daughter
wept
when
the
story
of
the
brigand
defeat
was
read
harris
who
had
brought
in
the
paper
could
not
conceal
his
joy
as
for
me
i
could
roam
about
the
country
now
and
i
was
enchanted
on
the
morning
of
the
i
set
out
with
my
box
and
my
walking
stick
dimitri
had
awakened
me
at
four
he
was
going
to
take
orders
from
an
english
family
who
had
been
staying
for
some
days
at
the
hotel
des
etrangers
i
walked
down
the
rue
to
the
square
and
passed
through
the
rue
passing
before
the
place
des
canons
i
saluted
the
small
artillery
of
the
kingdom
who
slept
under
a
shed
dreaming
of
the
taking
of
constantinople
and
with
four
strides
i
was
in
the
rue
de
patissia
the
which
bordered
either
side
had
begun
to
open
their
odorous
blossoms
the
sky
of
a
deep
blue
whitened
imperceptibly
between
hymettus
and
pentelicus
before
me
on
the
horizon
the
summit
of
parnassus
rose
like
broken
turrets
there
was
the
end
of
my
journey
i
descended
a
path
which
traversed
the
grounds
of
the
countess
janthe
théotoki
occupied
by
the
french
legation
i
passed
through
the
gardens
belonging
to
prince
michael
soutzo
and
the
school
of
plato
which
a
president
of
the
areopagus
had
put
up
in
a
lottery
some
years
before
and
i
entered
the
olive
groves
the
morning
thrushes
and
their
the
flew
from
tree
to
tree
and
sang
joyously
above
my
head
at
the
end
of
the
wood
i
traversed
the
immense
green
fields
where
attic
horses
short
and
squat
like
those
in
the
frieze
at
the
parthenon
consoled
themselves
for
the
dry
fodder
and
the
heating
food
of
winter
flocks
of
flew
away
at
my
approach
and
the
tufted
larks
mounted
vertically
in
the
sky
like
rockets
once
in
a
while
an
indolent
tortoise
crawled
across
the
path
dragging
his
house
i
turned
him
over
on
his
back
and
left
him
to
attend
to
his
own
affairs
after
two
hours
walking
i
entered
a
barren
waste
cultivation
ceased
one
saw
upon
the
arid
soil
tufts
of
sickly
grass
the
star
of
bethlehem
or
daffodils
the
sun
lifted
itself
above
the
horizon
and
i
distinctly
saw
the
which
grew
on
the
side
of
parnassus
the
path
which
i
had
taken
was
not
a
sure
guide
but
i
directed
my
steps
to
a
group
of
scattered
houses
on
the
mountain
side
and
which
was
called
the
village
of
castia
i
leaped
the
céphise
eleusinien
to
the
great
scandal
of
the
little
tortoises
who
leaped
like
frogs
into
the
water
a
hundred
steps
further
on
the
path
was
lost
in
a
deep
and
wide
ravine
worn
by
the
storms
of
two
or
three
thousand
winters
i
supposed
reasonably
enough
that
the
ravine
ought
to
be
the
right
road
i
had
noticed
in
my
former
excursions
that
the
greeks
did
not
trouble
themselves
with
making
roads
where
streams
were
liable
to
change
them
in
this
country
where
man
does
not
oppose
the
works
of
nature
torrents
are
royal
roads
brooks
are
department
routes
rivulets
are
tempests
are
the
and
rain
is
the
surveyor
of
wide
and
narrow
paths
i
entered
the
ravine
and
walked
between
two
river
banks
which
hid
the
plain
from
me
but
the
path
had
so
many
turns
that
i
should
not
have
known
in
which
direction
i
was
walking
if
i
had
not
kept
my
back
to
parnassus
the
wisest
course
would
have
been
to
climb
one
bank
or
the
other
and
ascertain
my
bearings
but
the
sides
were
perpendicular
i
was
weary
i
was
hungry
and
i
found
the
shade
refreshing
i
seated
myself
upon
a
bowlder
of
marble
i
took
from
my
box
a
piece
of
bread
some
cold
lamb
and
a
gourd
of
wine
i
said
to
myself
if
i
am
on
the
right
road
some
one
will
pass
and
i
can
find
out
where
i
am
in
fact
just
as
i
had
finished
lunching
and
was
about
to
stretch
myself
out
for
the
rest
which
follows
the
meal
of
travelers
or
serpents
i
thought
i
heard
a
horse
step
i
laid
my
ear
to
the
ground
and
heard
two
or
three
horses
coming
up
the
ravine
i
buckled
my
box
on
my
back
and
made
ready
to
follow
them
in
case
they
were
going
towards
parnassus
five
minutes
afterward
i
saw
coming
toward
me
two
ladies
mounted
upon
and
equipped
like
englishwomen
on
a
journey
behind
them
was
a
pedestrian
whom
i
had
no
trouble
in
recognizing
it
was
dimitri
you
who
know
the
world
a
little
you
have
noticed
that
a
traveler
starts
out
without
much
care
for
his
personal
appearance
but
if
he
is
about
to
meet
ladies
though
they
be
as
old
as
the
dove
of
the
ark
he
loses
at
once
his
indifference
and
looks
at
his
dusty
and
garments
with
a
troubled
eye
before
even
being
able
to
distinguish
the
faces
of
the
two
riders
behind
their
blue
veils
i
had
looked
myself
over
and
i
was
sufficiently
satisfied
i
wore
these
garments
which
i
have
on
and
which
are
even
now
presentable
although
that
was
two
years
ago
i
have
never
changed
the
fashion
of
my
hair
a
cap
although
as
fine
and
handsome
a
one
as
this
would
not
have
protected
a
traveler
from
the
sun
i
wore
instead
a
large
gray
felt
hat
which
the
dust
could
not
hurt
i
took
it
off
politely
as
the
ladies
passed
me
my
salutation
did
not
appear
to
trouble
them
much
i
held
out
my
hand
to
dimitri
and
he
told
me
in
a
few
words
all
that
i
wished
to
know
am
i
upon
the
road
to
parnassus
yes
we
are
going
there
i
can
go
with
you
then
why
not
who
are
these
ladies
english
milord
is
resting
at
the
hotel
what
kind
of
people
are
they
peugh
london
bankers
the
old
lady
is
simons
of
the
firm
of
barley
and
milord
is
her
brother
the
young
lady
is
her
daughter
pretty
according
to
taste
i
like
photini
looks
better
are
you
going
as
far
as
the
fortress
yes
i
am
engaged
for
a
week
at
ten
francs
a
day
and
board
i
organize
and
arrange
their
trips
i
began
with
this
one
because
i
knew
that
i
should
meet
you
but
what
is
the
matter
with
them
now
the
elder
woman
annoyed
because
i
was
detaining
her
servant
had
put
her
horse
to
a
trot
in
a
passage
where
no
one
had
ever
dared
to
trot
before
the
other
animal
filled
with
emulation
began
to
take
the
same
gait
and
if
we
had
talked
a
few
minutes
longer
we
would
have
been
distanced
dimitri
hastened
to
rejoin
the
ladies
and
i
heard
simons
say
to
him
in
english
do
not
go
away
from
us
i
am
english
and
i
wish
to
be
well
served
i
do
not
pay
you
to
chat
with
your
friends
who
is
this
greek
with
whom
you
are
talking
he
is
a
german
madame
ah
what
is
he
doing
he
is
searching
for
plants
he
is
an
apothecary
then
no
madame
he
is
a
scholar
ah
does
he
know
english
yes
madame
very
well
ah
the
three
ahs
were
said
in
three
different
tones
which
i
noticed
as
i
would
three
notes
of
music
they
indicated
by
very
noticeable
shades
the
progress
which
i
had
made
in
her
esteem
she
however
addressed
no
word
to
me
and
i
followed
them
a
few
feet
distant
dimitri
dared
not
speak
to
me
he
walked
ahead
like
a
prisoner
of
war
all
that
he
could
do
was
to
cast
two
or
three
looks
in
my
direction
which
seemed
to
say
but
these
english
are
impertinent
miss
simons
did
not
turn
her
head
and
i
was
unable
to
decide
in
what
her
ugliness
differed
from
photini
all
that
i
could
judge
was
that
the
young
english
girl
was
large
and
marvelously
her
shoulders
were
broad
her
waist
was
round
and
supple
as
a
reed
the
little
that
one
could
see
of
her
neck
made
one
think
of
the
swans
in
the
zoological
gardens
her
mother
turned
her
head
to
speak
to
her
and
i
hastened
forward
in
hope
of
hearing
her
voice
did
i
not
tell
you
that
i
was
extremely
curious
i
came
up
with
them
just
in
time
to
hear
the
following
conversation
mamma
i
am
hungry
are
you
i
am
mamma
i
am
warm
are
you
i
am
you
believe
that
this
truly
english
dialogue
made
me
smile
not
at
all
monsieur
i
was
under
a
spell
voice
had
worked
a
charm
the
truth
is
that
as
i
listened
i
experienced
a
delicious
agony
and
found
my
heart
beating
almost
to
suffocation
in
all
my
life
i
had
never
heard
anything
so
young
so
fresh
so
silvery
as
that
voice
the
sound
of
a
golden
shower
falling
on
my
father
roof
would
have
truly
sounded
less
sweet
to
me
i
thought
to
myself
what
a
misfortune
that
the
sweetest
songsters
among
birds
are
necessarily
the
ugliest
and
i
feared
to
see
her
face
and
yet
i
was
consumed
with
eager
desire
to
look
upon
it
such
a
strong
empire
has
curiosity
over
me
dimitri
had
calculated
upon
reaching
the
inn
at
calyvia
at
breakfast
time
it
was
a
house
made
of
planks
loosely
put
together
but
one
could
always
find
there
a
bottle
of
resin
wine
a
bottle
of
rhaki
that
is
to
say
of
cordial
some
brown
bread
eggs
and
a
regiment
of
venerable
hens
transformed
by
death
into
pullets
by
virtue
of
metempsychosis
unfortunately
the
inn
was
deserted
and
the
door
closed
at
this
news
simons
had
a
bitter
quarrel
with
dimitri
and
as
she
turned
around
i
saw
a
face
as
sharp
as
the
blade
of
a
sheffield
knife
with
two
rows
of
teeth
like
a
palisade
i
am
english
she
said
and
i
expect
to
eat
when
i
am
hungry
madame
dimitri
piteously
replied
you
can
breakfast
in
in
the
village
of
castia
i
had
breakfasted
and
i
was
free
to
abandon
myself
to
melancholy
reflections
upon
simons
ugliness
and
i
murmured
under
my
breath
an
aphorism
in
fraugman
latin
grammar
qualis
mater
talis
filia
from
the
inn
to
the
village
the
road
was
particularly
detestable
it
was
a
narrow
path
between
a
perpendicular
rock
and
a
precipice
which
made
even
the
chamois
dizzy
simons
before
starting
out
on
this
dangerous
path
where
the
horses
could
scarcely
find
asked
if
there
was
no
other
way
i
am
english
she
said
and
i
was
not
made
to
roll
down
precipices
dimitri
began
to
praise
the
path
he
assured
her
that
there
were
others
a
hundred
times
worse
in
the
kingdom
at
least
said
the
good
lady
take
hold
of
the
bridle
but
who
will
lead
my
daughter
go
and
lead
my
daughter
horse
still
i
must
not
break
my
own
neck
can
you
not
lead
both
horses
this
path
is
truly
horrible
i
believe
that
it
is
good
enough
for
the
greeks
but
it
was
not
made
for
the
english
is
it
not
so
she
added
turning
graciously
to
me
i
was
introduced
regularly
or
not
the
presentation
was
made
it
happened
under
the
auspices
of
a
personage
in
the
romances
of
the
middle
ages
whom
the
poets
of
the
xivth
century
called
danger
i
bowed
with
all
the
elegance
of
which
i
was
master
and
replied
in
english
madame
the
path
is
not
as
bad
as
it
appears
at
first
sight
your
horses
are
i
know
them
as
i
have
ridden
them
you
may
have
two
guides
if
you
will
permit
me
to
lead
mademoiselle
while
dimitri
leads
you
as
quickly
done
as
said
without
waiting
for
an
answer
i
boldly
advanced
and
took
the
bridle
of
horse
and
as
her
blue
veil
blew
back
i
saw
the
most
adorable
face
which
has
ever
enchanted
the
sight
of
a
german
naturalist
an
eccentric
poet
aurelian
scholl
pretends
that
every
man
has
in
his
heart
a
mass
of
eggs
in
each
one
of
which
is
a
love
all
that
is
needed
to
give
life
is
a
glance
from
a
woman
eye
i
am
too
much
of
a
scholar
to
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
this
hypothesis
does
not
rest
on
sure
foundations
and
that
it
is
in
formal
contradiction
to
all
the
revealed
facts
of
anatomy
i
ought
to
state
however
that
miss
simons
first
glance
caused
a
very
acute
agitation
in
the
region
of
my
heart
i
experienced
a
sensation
entirely
unusual
and
which
bore
no
trace
of
sadness
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
something
gave
way
in
the
osseous
formation
of
my
breast
below
the
bone
called
sternum
at
the
same
instant
the
blood
surged
through
my
veins
and
the
arteries
in
my
temples
beat
with
such
force
that
i
could
count
the
pulsations
what
eyes
she
had
i
hope
for
your
peace
of
mind
that
you
will
never
meet
a
pair
like
them
they
were
not
of
unusual
size
and
they
did
not
draw
attention
from
the
rest
of
her
face
they
were
neither
blue
nor
black
but
of
a
color
especially
their
own
it
was
a
warm
and
velvety
brown
which
one
sees
only
in
siberian
garnets
and
in
certain
garden
flowers
i
could
show
you
a
certain
scabieuse
and
a
variety
of
nearly
black
which
resembles
the
marvelous
shade
of
her
eyes
if
you
have
ever
visited
a
forge
at
midnight
you
have
doubtless
remarked
the
strange
color
which
gleams
from
a
steel
plate
as
it
changes
to
a
reddish
brown
that
too
was
like
her
eyes
as
for
the
charm
in
them
any
comparison
is
useless
charm
is
a
gift
with
which
few
individuals
are
endowed
eyes
possessed
something
naive
and
spiritual
a
frank
vivacity
sparkling
with
youth
and
health
and
sometimes
a
touching
languor
one
read
in
them
as
in
a
book
the
knowledge
of
a
woman
and
the
innocence
of
a
child
but
it
would
have
blinded
one
to
have
read
the
book
for
a
long
time
her
glance
burned
like
fire
as
truly
as
i
call
myself
hermann
it
would
have
ripened
the
peaches
on
your
garden
wall
words
fail
when
i
think
that
that
poor
simpleton
dimitri
found
her
less
beautiful
than
photini
in
truth
love
is
a
malady
which
singularly
stupefies
its
victims
i
who
had
never
lost
the
use
of
my
reason
and
who
judged
everything
with
the
wise
indifference
of
a
naturalist
i
confess
to
you
that
the
world
never
held
as
incomparable
a
woman
as
i
would
like
to
show
you
her
picture
as
it
is
graven
in
the
depths
of
my
memory
you
would
see
what
long
she
had
how
the
eyebrows
traced
a
beautiful
arch
above
her
eyes
how
small
her
mouth
was
how
white
her
teeth
how
rosy
and
transparent
her
little
ear
i
studied
her
beauty
in
the
minutest
details
because
i
possess
an
analytical
mind
and
have
formed
habits
of
observation
one
thing
struck
me
especially
it
was
the
fineness
and
transparency
of
her
skin
it
was
more
delicate
than
the
velvety
covering
which
envelops
beautiful
fruits
the
color
of
her
cheeks
seemed
made
of
that
impalpable
dust
which
adorns
the
wings
of
the
butterflies
if
i
had
not
been
a
doctor
of
natural
sciences
i
would
have
feared
that
the
contact
of
her
veil
would
brush
off
some
of
the
luster
of
her
beauty
i
do
not
know
whether
you
like
pale
women
or
not
and
i
do
not
wish
to
hurt
your
feelings
if
by
chance
you
have
a
taste
for
that
kind
of
deathly
looking
women
who
have
been
the
rage
during
certain
periods
but
in
my
quality
of
savant
i
can
admire
nothing
without
health
that
joy
of
life
if
i
had
become
a
doctor
i
would
have
been
a
safe
man
to
allow
in
any
family
because
it
is
certain
that
i
should
never
have
fallen
in
love
with
any
of
my
patients
the
sight
of
a
pretty
face
healthy
and
vivacious
gives
me
nearly
as
much
pleasure
as
finding
a
vigorous
beautiful
bush
whose
flowers
open
widely
in
the
sunshine
and
whose
leaves
have
never
been
touched
by
butterfly
or
cockchafer
so
that
the
first
time
that
i
saw
face
i
experienced
a
strong
temptation
to
take
her
hand
and
say
to
her
mademoiselle
how
happy
you
must
be
to
have
such
good
health
i
have
forgotten
to
tell
you
that
the
lines
of
her
face
were
not
regular
and
that
her
profile
was
not
that
of
a
statue
phidias
would
perhaps
have
refused
to
make
a
bust
of
her
but
your
pradier
would
have
begged
on
his
knees
for
sittings
i
must
confess
at
the
risk
of
destroying
your
illusions
that
she
had
a
dimple
in
her
left
cheek
but
none
in
the
right
this
is
contrary
to
all
laws
of
symmetry
know
moreover
that
her
nose
was
neither
straight
nor
aquiline
but
purely
retroussé
as
french
noses
are
but
that
this
rendered
her
less
pretty
i
will
deny
even
upon
the
scaffold
she
was
as
beautiful
as
greek
statues
are
but
was
entirely
different
beauty
can
not
be
judged
by
one
invariable
type
although
plato
affirms
it
it
varies
according
to
times
according
to
peoples
and
according
to
culture
the
venus
de
milo
was
considered
two
thousand
years
ago
the
most
beautiful
woman
of
the
archipelago
i
do
not
believe
that
in
she
would
have
been
considered
the
prettiest
woman
in
paris
take
her
to
a
dressmaker
in
the
place
vendome
or
to
a
milliner
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
and
in
these
places
she
would
be
less
of
a
success
than
some
other
women
whose
features
were
not
so
classical
and
whose
nose
was
not
so
straight
one
could
admire
a
woman
geometrically
beautiful
in
the
days
when
she
was
only
an
object
of
art
destined
to
please
the
eyes
without
appealing
to
the
mind
a
bird
of
paradise
at
whose
plumage
one
looks
without
thinking
of
asking
it
to
sing
a
beautiful
athenian
was
as
as
white
and
as
cold
as
the
column
of
a
temple
mérinay
has
shown
to
me
in
a
book
that
the
ionic
column
is
only
a
woman
disguised
the
portico
of
the
temple
of
erechtée
at
the
acropolis
at
athens
rests
upon
four
athenian
women
of
the
century
of
pericles
the
women
of
are
little
winged
beings
active
busy
and
above
all
thoughtful
created
not
to
hold
temples
on
their
heads
but
to
awaken
genius
to
engage
in
work
to
animate
with
courage
and
to
light
the
world
with
the
flashes
of
their
wit
what
we
love
in
them
and
what
makes
their
beauty
is
not
regularity
of
features
it
is
the
lively
and
mobile
expression
of
sentiments
more
delicate
than
ours
it
is
the
radiation
of
thought
around
that
fragile
envelope
which
does
not
suffice
to
contain
it
it
is
the
quick
play
of
a
speaking
physiognomy
i
am
not
a
sculptor
but
if
i
knew
how
to
use
the
chisel
and
one
gave
me
a
commission
to
make
a
statue
of
our
epoch
i
swear
to
you
that
she
would
have
a
dimple
in
her
left
cheek
and
a
retroussé
nose
i
led
horse
to
the
village
of
castia
what
she
said
to
me
on
the
way
and
what
i
replied
left
no
more
impression
on
my
mind
than
the
flight
of
a
swallow
leaves
on
the
air
her
voice
was
so
sweet
to
listen
to
that
i
probably
did
not
listen
to
what
she
said
it
was
as
if
i
were
at
the
opera
where
the
music
does
not
often
permit
one
to
hear
the
words
all
the
circumstances
of
that
first
interview
made
an
ineffaceable
impression
on
my
mind
i
have
only
to
close
my
eyes
to
believe
that
i
am
still
there
the
april
sun
shone
softly
on
my
head
above
the
path
and
below
the
resinous
trees
disseminated
their
aromatic
odors
through
the
air
the
pines
the
thugas
and
the
turpentine
trees
gave
forth
a
harsh
and
acrid
incense
as
passed
she
inhaled
with
evident
happiness
nature
odorous
largess
her
dear
little
nose
breathed
in
the
fragrance
her
eyes
those
beautiful
eyes
roved
from
object
to
object
with
sparkling
joy
seeing
her
so
pretty
so
lively
so
happy
you
would
have
said
that
a
dryad
had
escaped
from
its
wood
i
can
see
now
the
horse
she
rode
it
was
psari
a
white
horse
from
zimmerman
her
habit
was
black
simons
which
showed
distinctly
against
the
sky
was
sufficiently
eccentric
to
testify
to
her
independence
of
taste
she
also
wore
a
black
hat
of
that
absurd
and
ungraceful
shape
worn
by
men
of
all
countries
her
daughter
wore
the
gray
felt
adopted
by
the
heroines
of
the
fronde
both
wore
chamois
gloves
hand
was
not
small
but
admirably
formed
i
have
never
worn
gloves
i
do
not
like
them
and
you
the
village
of
castia
was
as
deserted
as
the
inn
at
calyvia
dimitri
could
not
understand
why
we
dismounted
in
front
of
the
church
beside
a
fountain
each
went
from
house
to
house
knocking
at
the
doors
not
a
soul
no
one
at
the
priest
no
one
at
the
magistrate
the
authorities
of
the
village
had
moved
away
with
the
residents
each
house
consisted
of
four
walls
and
a
roof
with
two
openings
one
of
which
served
as
door
the
other
as
window
poor
dimitri
forced
in
two
or
three
doors
and
opened
five
or
six
shutters
to
assure
himself
that
the
inmates
were
not
asleep
these
incursions
resulted
in
setting
free
an
unfortunate
cat
forgotten
by
its
master
and
which
departed
like
a
flash
in
the
direction
of
the
wood
soon
simons
lost
patience
i
am
english
she
said
to
dimitri
and
one
does
not
mock
me
with
impunity
i
shall
complain
to
the
legation
what
i
hire
you
for
a
trip
to
the
mountains
and
you
make
me
travel
over
precipices
i
order
you
to
bring
food
and
you
expose
me
to
starvation
we
were
to
breakfast
at
the
inn
the
inn
is
abandoned
i
had
the
goodness
to
follow
you
fasting
to
this
frightful
village
and
all
the
inhabitants
have
fled
all
this
is
unnatural
i
have
traveled
in
switzerland
switzerland
is
a
country
of
mountains
however
nothing
was
lacking
there
and
i
had
trout
to
eat
do
you
hear
tried
to
calm
her
mother
but
the
good
woman
could
not
and
would
not
listen
dimitri
explained
to
her
as
fully
as
she
would
permit
him
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
were
nearly
all
and
that
their
business
very
often
took
them
into
the
mountains
in
any
case
the
time
was
not
lost
it
was
not
later
than
eight
and
they
were
sure
to
find
within
ten
minutes
walk
an
inhabited
house
where
breakfast
would
be
all
prepared
what
house
demanded
simons
the
farm
at
the
convent
the
monks
from
pentelicus
have
broad
lands
above
castia
they
raise
bees
there
the
good
old
man
who
carries
on
the
farm
always
has
wine
bread
honey
and
fowls
he
will
give
us
our
breakfast
he
may
have
gone
away
like
everyone
else
if
he
is
away
it
will
not
be
far
the
time
for
the
swarming
is
near
and
he
would
not
wish
to
lose
his
bees
go
and
see
as
for
me
i
have
gone
far
enough
since
morning
i
vow
to
you
that
i
will
not
remount
until
after
i
have
eaten
madame
you
need
not
remount
said
dimitri
patient
as
are
all
guides
we
can
hitch
our
horses
to
the
fountain
and
we
shall
quickly
reach
the
place
on
foot
influenced
her
mother
to
consent
she
was
dying
to
see
the
good
old
man
and
his
apiary
dimitri
hitched
the
horses
to
the
watering
trough
weighting
each
bridle
with
a
huge
stone
simons
and
her
daughter
looped
up
their
habits
and
we
started
up
a
precipitous
path
fit
only
for
the
goats
of
castia
the
green
lizards
which
were
warming
themselves
in
the
sun
discreetly
retired
at
our
approach
but
each
drew
a
piercing
cry
from
simons
who
had
a
horror
of
reptiles
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
these
vocalizations
she
had
at
last
the
joy
of
seeing
an
open
house
and
a
human
face
it
was
the
farmhouse
and
the
old
man
the
house
was
a
small
one
made
of
red
bricks
topped
with
five
cupolas
almost
like
a
mosque
to
the
village
at
a
distance
it
possessed
a
certain
elegance
comely
without
and
coarse
within
it
was
a
sample
of
the
orient
one
saw
in
the
shelter
of
a
hill
covered
with
thyme
a
hundred
straw
placed
in
a
line
like
the
tents
in
a
camp
the
king
of
this
empire
the
good
old
man
was
a
small
young
man
of
round
and
merry
all
greek
monks
are
honored
with
the
title
of
good
old
man
age
having
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
was
dressed
like
a
peasant
except
his
bonnet
which
was
black
instead
of
red
it
was
by
this
sign
that
dimitri
recognized
him
the
little
man
seeing
us
running
toward
him
raised
his
arms
to
heaven
and
appeared
utterly
amazed
here
is
an
original
simons
exclaimed
what
astonishes
him
so
much
one
would
say
that
he
had
never
seen
any
english
people
before
dimitri
who
had
run
on
ahead
kissed
the
monk
hand
and
said
to
him
with
a
curious
mixture
of
respect
and
familiarity
thy
blessing
father
wring
the
necks
of
two
chickens
we
will
pay
thee
well
unhappy
man
why
do
you
come
here
to
breakfast
didst
thou
not
see
that
the
inn
was
deserted
i
saw
it
so
well
that
i
found
no
one
at
home
and
that
the
village
was
deserted
if
i
had
met
anyone
i
should
not
have
climbed
up
to
thy
house
thou
art
then
in
accord
with
them
them
with
whom
the
brigands
are
there
brigands
on
parnassus
since
day
before
yesterday
where
are
they
everywhere
dimitri
turned
quickly
toward
us
and
said
we
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
the
brigands
are
in
the
mountains
let
us
run
for
our
horses
have
courage
mesdames
and
step
out
lively
if
you
please
this
is
too
hard
cried
simons
without
having
breakfasted
madame
your
breakfast
would
cost
you
dear
let
us
hasten
for
the
love
of
god
is
this
a
conspiracy
you
have
sworn
to
make
me
die
of
hunger
behold
the
brigands
as
if
there
were
brigands
i
do
not
believe
in
brigands
all
the
papers
state
that
they
are
disbanded
moreover
i
am
english
and
if
anyone
touched
a
hair
of
my
head
was
less
confident
she
leaned
on
my
arm
and
asked
me
if
i
thought
that
we
were
in
danger
of
death
of
death
no
of
being
robbed
yes
of
what
importance
is
that
they
are
welcome
to
take
all
that
i
carry
if
only
they
will
give
me
my
breakfast
i
learned
later
that
the
poor
woman
was
subject
to
a
rare
malady
which
the
vulgar
call
canine
appetite
and
our
learned
men
know
as
when
hunger
assailed
her
she
would
have
given
her
fortune
for
a
plate
of
lentils
dimitri
and
each
seized
a
hand
and
dragged
her
to
the
path
we
had
just
ascended
the
little
monk
followed
her
gesticulating
i
was
strongly
tempted
to
push
forward
but
a
quick
and
imperative
tone
stopped
us
suddenly
halt
i
say
i
raised
my
eyes
two
mastic
bushes
and
were
on
the
right
and
left
of
the
path
from
each
bush
the
muzzles
of
three
or
four
guns
protruded
a
voice
cried
in
greek
seat
yourselves
on
the
ground
this
operation
was
exceedingly
easy
for
me
as
my
knees
weakened
under
me
but
i
consoled
myself
with
the
thought
that
ajax
agamemnon
and
the
achilles
if
they
found
themselves
in
a
like
position
would
not
have
refused
the
seat
offered
them
the
guns
were
lowered
toward
us
i
expected
to
see
them
pushed
out
so
far
that
their
muzzles
would
touch
each
other
over
our
heads
it
was
not
that
i
was
afraid
but
i
had
never
before
realized
the
extraordinary
length
of
greek
guns
the
whole
arsenal
marched
out
into
the
path
showing
the
owner
of
each
the
only
difference
which
exists
between
devils
and
brigands
is
that
devils
are
less
black
than
one
expects
and
brigands
more
squalid
than
one
supposes
the
eight
scoundrels
who
surrounded
us
were
so
foul
that
i
would
have
preferred
to
give
them
my
money
with
pinchers
one
could
imagine
that
their
bonnets
might
once
have
been
red
but
lye
itself
could
never
have
found
the
original
shade
of
their
coats
all
the
rocks
of
the
kingdom
had
contributed
to
the
color
of
their
percale
skirts
and
their
vests
bore
a
specimen
of
the
different
soils
upon
which
they
had
reposed
their
hands
their
faces
and
even
their
mustaches
were
of
a
reddish
gray
like
the
dirt
which
they
had
on
their
clothes
every
animal
colors
itself
like
the
house
or
land
it
inhabits
the
foxes
of
greenland
are
like
the
snow
lions
the
color
of
the
desert
partridges
like
the
ground
the
greek
brigands
the
color
of
the
paths
the
chief
of
the
little
band
who
had
taken
us
prisoners
was
not
distinguished
by
outward
sign
possibly
his
face
his
hands
his
clothes
were
richer
in
dirt
than
those
of
his
comrades
he
bent
over
us
from
his
great
height
and
examined
us
so
closely
that
i
almost
felt
the
touch
of
his
gray
mustache
you
would
have
thought
him
a
tiger
who
smelled
his
prey
before
devouring
it
when
his
curiosity
was
satisfied
he
said
to
dimitri
empty
thy
pockets
dimitri
did
not
make
him
repeat
it
the
second
time
he
threw
down
at
his
feet
a
knife
a
bag
of
tobacco
and
three
mexican
piastres
which
made
a
sum
of
sixteen
francs
is
that
all
demanded
the
brigand
yes
brother
thou
art
the
servant
yes
brother
take
one
piastre
thou
must
not
return
to
the
city
without
money
dimitri
began
to
haggle
thou
mightest
leave
me
two
i
have
two
horses
below
they
are
hired
from
the
stable
i
will
have
to
pay
for
the
day
thou
canst
explain
to
zimmerman
that
we
have
taken
thy
money
and
if
he
insists
on
being
paid
even
then
tell
him
that
he
is
only
too
happy
in
seeing
his
horses
again
he
knows
very
well
that
you
would
not
take
the
horses
what
would
you
do
with
them
in
the
mountains
enough
tell
me
who
is
this
tall
thin
man
behind
thee
i
answered
for
myself
an
honest
german
whose
spoils
will
not
enrich
you
thou
speakest
greek
well
empty
thy
pockets
i
placed
on
the
ground
twenty
francs
my
tobacco
my
pipe
and
my
handkerchief
what
is
that
a
handkerchief
what
for
to
wipe
my
nose
why
didst
thou
tell
me
that
thou
wert
poor
only
lords
wipe
their
noses
with
handkerchiefs
take
off
the
box
which
thou
carriest
on
thy
back
that
is
well
now
open
it
my
box
contained
some
plants
a
book
a
knife
a
small
packet
of
arsenic
an
almost
empty
gourd
of
wine
and
the
remains
of
my
breakfast
which
brought
a
gleam
of
covetousness
to
simons
eyes
i
had
the
impudence
to
offer
them
to
her
before
my
property
changed
hands
she
snatched
them
greedily
and
began
to
devour
the
bread
and
meat
to
my
great
astonishment
this
gluttonous
act
disgusted
the
thieves
who
murmured
among
themselves
the
word
the
monk
made
a
signs
of
the
cross
according
to
the
rite
of
the
greek
church
thou
probably
hast
a
watch
said
the
brigand
to
me
put
it
with
the
other
things
i
took
off
my
silver
watch
an
heirloom
which
weighed
about
four
ounces
the
rascals
passed
it
from
hand
to
hand
and
found
it
very
beautiful
i
hoped
that
admiration
which
softens
men
feelings
would
dispose
them
to
restore
to
me
something
of
my
belongings
and
i
begged
the
chief
to
give
me
my
tin
box
he
rudely
told
me
to
keep
silent
at
least
i
persisted
give
back
my
two
écus
so
that
i
can
return
to
the
city
he
replied
with
a
sardonic
grin
thou
wilt
have
no
use
for
them
simons
turn
had
come
before
putting
her
hand
into
her
pocket
she
addressed
our
captors
in
the
tongue
of
her
fathers
english
is
one
of
the
rare
languages
which
one
can
speak
with
one
mouth
full
reflect
well
upon
what
you
are
doing
she
said
in
a
menacing
tone
i
am
an
englishwoman
and
english
subjects
are
sacred
in
every
country
in
the
world
what
you
take
from
me
will
serve
you
little
and
cost
you
dear
england
will
avenge
me
and
you
will
be
hung
at
the
very
least
now
if
you
wish
my
money
you
have
only
to
speak
but
it
will
burn
your
fingers
it
is
english
money
what
does
she
say
asked
the
leader
of
the
brigands
dimitri
answered
she
says
she
is
english
so
much
the
better
all
the
english
are
rich
tell
her
to
shell
out
the
poor
woman
emptied
her
pocket
her
purse
contained
a
dozen
sovereigns
as
her
watch
was
not
in
sight
and
as
they
did
not
search
us
she
kept
that
the
kindness
of
these
thieves
left
her
her
handkerchief
threw
down
her
watch
and
a
string
of
charms
against
the
evil
eye
she
took
off
with
mutinous
grace
a
bag
which
she
wore
slung
on
her
shoulder
the
bandit
opened
it
with
all
the
importance
of
a
officer
he
took
out
an
english
a
bottle
of
english
a
box
of
english
menthol
pastilles
and
a
hundred
and
several
odd
francs
of
english
money
now
said
the
enraged
beauty
you
can
let
us
go
we
have
nothing
more
for
you
one
of
the
men
indicated
to
her
by
a
menacing
gesture
that
the
interview
was
not
yet
over
the
leader
of
the
band
knelt
down
before
their
spoils
called
the
monk
counted
the
money
in
his
presence
and
gave
to
him
a
sum
of
francs
simons
nudged
me
do
you
see
she
whispered
the
monk
and
dimitri
have
betrayed
us
into
their
hands
the
bandits
have
divided
with
them
no
madame
i
replied
dimitri
has
received
only
a
fraction
of
what
was
taken
from
him
it
is
customary
everywhere
on
the
borders
of
the
rhine
when
a
traveler
is
ruined
at
roulette
the
banker
gives
him
enough
to
return
home
but
the
monk
he
has
only
received
the
tithe
of
the
spoils
according
to
custom
from
time
immemorial
do
not
reproach
him
but
rather
be
grateful
to
him
in
his
wish
to
save
us
when
his
convent
would
have
benefited
by
our
capture
this
conversation
was
interrupted
by
dimitri
departure
they
had
told
him
that
he
was
free
wait
for
me
i
said
to
him
we
will
return
together
he
sadly
shook
his
head
and
answered
in
english
so
that
the
ladies
could
understand
you
are
prisoners
for
a
time
and
you
will
not
see
athens
again
until
you
have
paid
a
ransom
i
am
going
to
inform
milord
have
the
ladies
any
message
to
send
to
him
tell
him
cried
simons
that
he
must
hurry
to
the
ambassador
that
he
must
go
to
piraeus
to
find
the
admiral
that
he
must
complain
at
the
foreign
office
and
he
must
surely
write
to
lord
palmerston
that
we
must
be
rescued
from
here
by
force
of
arms
if
necessary
or
by
political
authority
but
that
i
will
not
hear
of
paying
one
penny
for
my
liberty
and
i
i
said
with
less
anger
i
pray
thee
to
tell
my
friends
in
whose
hands
thou
hast
left
me
if
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
few
hundred
drachmas
to
ransom
a
poor
devil
of
a
naturalist
they
will
furnish
them
without
doubt
the
lords
of
the
road
will
not
put
a
very
high
price
on
me
i
wish
whilst
thou
art
still
here
that
thou
wouldst
ask
them
the
price
useless
my
dear
hermann
they
do
not
fix
the
ransom
who
then
their
chief
iv
dimitri
descended
to
athens
the
monk
went
back
to
his
bees
our
new
masters
pushed
us
into
the
path
which
led
to
the
camp
of
their
king
simons
rebelled
and
refused
to
stir
a
step
the
brigands
threatened
to
carry
her
in
their
arms
she
declared
that
she
would
not
let
them
carry
her
but
her
daughter
talked
her
into
a
more
tractable
frame
of
mind
telling
that
she
would
find
the
table
spread
and
that
she
would
be
invited
to
breakfast
by
was
more
surprised
than
frightened
the
followers
who
had
come
to
arrest
us
had
acted
with
a
certain
courtesy
they
had
not
searched
us
and
they
had
kept
their
hands
from
their
prisoners
instead
of
turning
our
pockets
wrong
side
out
they
had
asked
us
to
put
down
our
money
and
valuables
ourselves
they
made
no
remark
about
the
ladies
and
they
did
not
even
ask
them
to
take
off
their
gloves
we
were
far
it
seemed
from
those
highwaymen
in
spain
and
italy
who
cut
off
a
finger
to
get
a
ring
and
who
tear
out
an
to
possess
themselves
of
a
diamond
or
pearl
all
these
misfortunes
were
reduced
to
the
payment
of
a
ransom
yet
was
it
not
probable
that
we
might
be
delivered
without
it
how
could
one
imagine
that
would
be
able
to
hold
us
with
impunity
at
five
leagues
from
the
capital
from
the
court
from
the
greek
army
from
her
britannic
majesty
battalion
at
an
english
station
thus
reasoned
as
for
me
i
involuntarily
thought
of
those
two
little
daughters
whom
mistra
went
to
seek
and
i
was
sad
i
feared
that
simons
in
her
obstinate
patriotism
only
exposed
her
daughter
to
some
great
danger
and
i
promised
myself
that
i
would
enlighten
her
as
to
her
position
we
walked
in
a
narrow
path
single
file
separated
from
each
other
by
our
disagreeable
companions
the
journey
seemed
to
me
to
be
interminable
and
i
asked
more
than
ten
times
if
we
would
not
soon
be
there
the
road
was
frightful
in
the
crevices
of
the
bare
rock
an
oak
sapling
struggled
for
life
or
a
thorny
bush
scratched
our
legs
the
victorious
bandits
manifested
no
joy
and
their
triumphal
march
resembled
a
funeral
parade
they
silently
smoked
cigarettes
as
large
as
one
finger
they
did
not
speak
one
only
now
and
then
hummed
a
sort
of
tune
those
people
are
as
lugubrious
as
a
ruin
about
eleven
a
fierce
barking
announced
the
neighborhood
of
the
camp
ten
or
a
dozen
enormous
dogs
rushed
out
and
hurled
themselves
upon
us
showing
all
their
teeth
our
captors
drove
them
back
with
stones
and
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
hostilities
peace
was
declared
these
inhospitable
monsters
were
the
advance
sentinels
of
the
king
of
the
mountains
they
scent
the
soldiers
as
a
contrabandist
dog
scents
a
officer
but
that
is
not
all
and
their
zeal
is
so
great
that
they
occasionally
devoured
an
inoffensive
shepherd
a
lost
traveler
or
even
one
of
band
the
king
kept
them
as
the
old
sultans
kept
their
janissaries
with
the
perpetual
fear
of
falling
a
victim
to
them
the
king
camp
was
a
plateau
of
seven
or
eight
hundred
metres
in
extent
i
searched
everywhere
for
our
captors
tents
the
brigands
were
not
sybarites
and
they
slept
under
the
sky
on
the
of
april
i
saw
neither
heaps
of
spoils
nor
a
display
of
treasures
nothing
which
one
would
hope
to
find
at
the
headquarters
of
a
band
of
brigands
took
upon
himself
the
sale
of
the
plunder
each
man
received
his
pay
in
silver
and
used
it
according
to
his
fancy
some
put
their
money
into
commerce
others
invested
in
mortgages
on
houses
in
athens
while
others
bought
land
in
their
villages
no
one
squandered
the
proceeds
of
theft
our
arrival
interrupted
the
morning
meal
of
or
thirty
men
who
hastened
to
meet
us
bread
and
cheese
in
hand
the
chief
furnished
his
band
with
food
the
men
received
every
day
a
ration
of
bread
oil
wine
cheese
caviare
piment
wine
mixed
with
honey
and
spices
bitter
olives
and
meat
when
their
religion
permitted
gourmands
who
wish
for
mallows
and
other
green
food
can
pick
these
dainties
on
the
mountains
brigands
as
some
other
classes
of
people
rarely
light
a
fire
for
their
repasts
they
eat
their
food
cold
and
their
vegetables
uncooked
i
noticed
that
everyone
was
religiously
observing
the
law
of
abstinence
we
were
on
the
eve
of
the
celebration
of
the
ascension
and
these
good
people
of
whom
the
most
innocent
had
at
least
the
life
of
one
man
on
his
conscience
would
not
touch
a
mouthful
of
meat
holding
up
two
englishwomen
at
the
point
of
a
musket
seemed
an
insignificant
sin
simons
had
very
greatly
sinned
in
eating
the
cold
meat
the
wednesday
before
ascension
the
men
who
had
escorted
us
satisfied
the
curiosity
of
their
comrades
they
were
overwhelmed
with
questions
and
they
answered
them
all
they
put
down
in
a
pile
the
booty
they
had
secured
and
my
silver
watch
scored
yet
another
success
which
added
to
my
pride
little
gold
watch
was
less
noticed
in
that
first
interview
public
attention
fell
upon
my
watch
and
it
reflected
a
little
on
me
in
the
eyes
of
these
simple
men
the
owner
of
such
an
imposing
piece
of
silver
could
be
no
less
than
a
lord
the
bandits
curiosity
was
annoying
but
not
insolent
they
did
not
treat
us
harshly
they
knew
that
we
were
in
their
hands
and
that
we
would
be
exchanged
sooner
or
later
for
a
certain
number
of
gold
pieces
but
they
did
not
think
that
they
ought
to
avail
themselves
of
that
circumstance
to
maltreat
us
or
show
a
lack
of
respect
good
sense
that
imperishable
spirit
of
the
greeks
told
them
that
we
represented
a
different
race
and
one
to
a
certain
degree
superior
victorious
barbarians
render
a
secret
homage
to
a
conquered
civilized
people
many
of
these
men
saw
for
the
first
time
the
european
dress
these
walked
around
us
as
the
inhabitants
of
the
new
world
around
spaniards
they
furtively
felt
my
coat
to
see
of
what
material
it
was
made
they
would
have
been
happy
to
have
examined
the
articles
of
my
clothing
one
by
one
perhaps
even
they
would
have
liked
to
break
me
in
two
or
three
pieces
in
order
to
study
the
inner
mechanism
of
a
lord
but
i
am
sure
that
they
would
have
done
it
with
profuse
excuses
and
not
without
asking
pardon
for
the
liberty
simons
soon
lost
patience
she
did
not
like
to
be
examined
so
closely
by
these
who
offered
her
no
breakfast
no
one
likes
to
be
made
a
spectacle
of
the
role
of
living
curiosity
very
much
displeased
the
good
woman
although
she
had
filled
it
advantageously
in
all
countries
of
the
globe
as
for
she
was
overcome
with
fatigue
a
ride
of
six
hours
hunger
emotion
surprise
had
worn
out
this
delicate
creature
imagine
this
young
girl
brought
up
delicately
accustomed
to
walk
on
carpets
or
upon
the
velvety
turf
of
parks
her
shoes
were
already
nearly
off
her
feet
worn
out
by
the
roughness
of
the
path
and
the
bushes
had
torn
her
dress
only
the
evening
before
she
had
taken
tea
in
the
parlors
of
the
english
legation
while
looking
over
the
beautiful
albums
belonging
to
wyse
she
now
found
herself
transported
into
a
frightful
country
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
savages
and
she
had
not
the
consolation
of
saying
it
is
a
dream
because
she
was
neither
in
bed
nor
even
seated
but
standing
in
great
despair
on
her
two
weary
little
feet
a
band
now
surrounded
us
which
rendered
our
position
intolerable
it
was
not
a
band
of
thieves
it
was
worse
the
greeks
carry
upon
their
persons
a
whole
menagerie
of
little
animals
agile
capricious
not
seizable
who
cling
to
them
night
and
day
give
them
occupation
even
when
asleep
and
by
their
jumps
and
their
stings
accelerate
the
action
of
the
mind
and
the
circulation
of
the
blood
the
fleas
of
the
brigands
of
which
i
can
show
some
specimens
in
my
entomological
collection
are
very
much
larger
stronger
and
more
agile
than
their
city
cousins
the
open
country
air
possesses
virtue
so
powerful
i
soon
perceived
that
they
were
not
content
with
their
lot
and
that
they
found
more
to
their
taste
the
fine
skin
of
a
young
german
than
the
tough
hide
of
their
masters
an
emigrating
army
settled
upon
me
i
felt
at
first
an
uneasy
sensation
around
the
ankles
it
was
the
declaration
of
war
two
minutes
later
an
advance
guard
threw
itself
upon
the
calf
of
my
right
leg
it
reached
my
knee
i
was
and
all
resistance
became
useless
if
i
had
been
alone
i
might
have
been
more
successful
in
the
combat
i
dared
neither
complain
nor
defend
myself
i
heroically
hid
my
sorrows
and
did
not
raise
my
eyes
at
last
at
the
end
of
my
patience
and
determined
to
escape
by
flight
from
the
pests
i
demanded
to
be
taken
before
the
king
this
recalled
our
guides
to
their
duty
they
asked
the
whereabouts
of
the
reply
was
that
he
was
at
work
in
his
offices
at
last
said
simons
i
can
seat
myself
in
an
easy
chair
she
took
my
arm
offered
hers
to
her
daughter
and
walked
with
a
deliberate
step
in
the
direction
in
which
the
crowd
conducted
us
the
offices
were
not
far
from
the
camp
and
we
reached
them
in
five
minutes
the
offices
of
the
king
resembled
other
offices
as
the
bandits
camp
was
like
to
other
camps
there
were
neither
tables
chairs
nor
furniture
of
any
sort
was
seated
upon
a
square
of
carpet
under
the
shade
of
a
fir
tree
four
secretaries
and
two
servants
sat
around
him
a
young
boy
of
sixteen
or
eighteen
was
incessantly
occupied
in
filling
lighting
and
cleaning
his
master
chibouk
he
wore
at
his
belt
a
tobacco
bag
embroidered
with
gold
and
fine
pearls
and
a
pair
of
silver
tongs
used
for
taking
out
coals
another
servant
passed
his
days
preparing
cups
of
coffee
glasses
of
water
and
syrup
destined
for
the
royal
mouth
the
secretaries
seated
on
the
bare
rock
wrote
with
cut
reeds
upon
their
knees
each
of
them
had
a
long
copper
box
containing
reeds
a
knife
and
an
inkstand
some
tin
cylinders
like
those
in
which
soldiers
keep
their
papers
served
as
a
place
of
safety
for
their
archives
the
paper
was
not
poor
for
the
reason
that
each
sheet
bore
in
capitals
the
word
bath
the
king
was
an
old
man
marvelously
straight
thin
supple
as
a
steel
spring
clean
and
shining
as
a
new
sword
his
long
white
mustaches
hung
over
the
chin
like
two
marble
stalactites
the
rest
of
his
face
was
scrupulously
shaved
the
cranium
bare
as
far
as
the
occiput
where
a
great
mass
of
white
hair
flowed
down
from
under
his
bonnet
the
expression
of
his
face
was
calm
and
reflective
a
pair
of
small
clear
blue
eyes
and
a
chin
denoted
an
inflexible
will
his
face
was
long
and
the
many
long
wrinkles
added
to
its
length
every
fold
in
his
forehead
seemed
to
break
in
the
middle
and
diverge
toward
the
meeting
of
his
eyebrows
two
wide
and
deep
furrows
descended
to
the
corners
of
the
lips
as
if
the
weight
of
the
mustaches
dragged
down
the
muscles
of
the
face
i
have
seen
a
great
number
of
septuagenarians
i
have
even
dissected
one
who
would
have
attained
a
hundred
if
the
diligence
from
osnabruck
had
not
passed
over
his
body
but
i
never
remembered
having
seen
an
old
man
fresher
and
more
robust
than
he
wore
the
dress
of
tino
and
all
the
islands
of
the
archipelago
his
red
bonnet
formed
a
large
fold
around
his
forehead
he
wore
a
black
vest
heavily
embroidered
with
black
silk
immense
blue
trousers
which
must
have
taken
twenty
metres
of
cotton
stuff
and
large
boots
of
russia
leather
solid
yet
supple
the
only
richness
about
his
costume
was
a
belt
decked
with
gold
and
precious
stones
worth
two
or
three
thousand
francs
thrust
in
it
was
a
purse
of
embroidered
cashmere
a
damascus
blade
in
a
silver
sheath
a
long
pistol
mounted
with
gold
and
rubies
and
a
ramrod
similarly
decorated
immovable
in
the
midst
of
his
secretaries
the
king
moved
only
his
lips
and
his
fingers
his
lips
to
dictate
his
letters
his
fingers
to
tell
off
the
beads
of
his
rosary
it
was
one
of
those
beautiful
amber
rosaries
which
serve
not
only
to
mark
the
number
of
prayers
but
to
amuse
the
solemn
idleness
of
the
turks
he
raised
his
head
at
our
approach
divined
by
a
glance
what
had
brought
us
to
him
and
said
with
a
gravity
not
at
all
ironical
you
are
very
welcome
be
seated
monsieur
cried
simons
i
am
english
and
he
interrupted
the
discourse
all
in
good
time
he
said
i
am
occupied
he
spoke
in
greek
and
simons
understood
only
english
but
the
king
face
was
so
expressive
that
the
good
woman
easily
comprehended
what
he
meant
without
the
aid
of
an
interpreter
we
sat
down
on
the
ground
fifteen
or
twenty
brigands
crouched
around
us
and
the
king
who
had
no
secrets
to
hide
dictated
family
letters
as
well
as
those
pertaining
to
business
the
leader
of
the
band
which
had
arrested
us
went
to
him
and
whispered
in
his
ear
he
haughtily
answered
what
of
that
i
am
doing
nothing
wrong
and
the
whole
world
is
welcome
to
hear
me
go
seat
thyself
thou
spiro
write
it
is
to
my
daughter
after
he
had
vigorously
blown
his
nose
he
dictated
in
a
grave
yet
sweet
voice
my
dear
child
the
preceptress
of
the
school
writes
to
me
that
thy
health
is
much
improved
and
that
the
severe
cold
with
which
thou
wast
troubled
has
left
thee
with
the
cold
winter
weather
but
she
is
not
pleased
with
thy
lack
of
application
and
complains
that
thou
hast
done
nothing
with
thy
studies
during
the
month
of
april
mme
mavros
writes
that
thou
hast
become
distrait
and
that
thou
sittest
with
thy
elbow
on
thy
book
thy
eyes
looking
at
nothing
as
if
thou
wert
thinking
of
something
else
i
know
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
tell
thee
to
work
assiduously
follow
the
example
of
my
life
if
i
had
taken
it
easy
as
many
do
i
should
never
have
reached
the
position
which
i
occupy
in
society
i
wish
to
have
thee
worthy
of
me
that
is
why
i
make
great
sacrifices
for
thy
education
thou
knowest
that
i
have
never
refused
thee
the
masters
nor
the
books
for
which
thou
hast
asked
but
my
money
must
profit
by
it
the
set
of
scott
has
arrived
at
piraeus
also
the
and
all
the
other
english
books
thou
hast
said
that
thou
didst
wish
to
read
have
our
friends
in
the
rue
get
them
from
the
for
thee
thou
wilt
receive
at
the
same
time
the
bracelet
which
thou
desirest
and
that
steel
machine
for
puffing
out
thy
skirts
if
the
piano
from
vienna
is
not
as
good
as
thou
toldest
me
and
it
seems
necessary
that
thou
shouldst
have
another
thou
shalt
have
it
i
shall
do
one
or
two
villages
after
the
sales
of
the
harvest
and
the
devil
will
be
against
me
if
i
can
not
find
enough
money
for
a
pretty
piano
i
think
as
thou
dost
that
thou
must
learn
music
use
thy
sundays
in
the
way
i
have
told
thee
and
profit
by
the
kindness
of
our
friends
thou
must
learn
to
speak
french
english
and
above
all
german
because
thou
art
not
to
live
forever
in
this
ridiculous
country
and
i
would
rather
see
thee
dead
than
married
to
a
greek
daughter
of
a
king
thou
shouldst
by
right
marry
a
prince
i
do
not
mean
a
prince
of
smugglers
like
all
our
fanariot
families
who
pride
themselves
on
their
descent
from
oriental
emperors
and
whom
i
would
not
have
for
servants
but
a
prince
reigning
and
crowned
one
can
find
some
very
good
ones
in
germany
and
my
fortune
will
enable
me
to
choose
one
of
them
if
these
germans
come
to
reign
in
this
country
i
do
not
see
why
thou
canst
not
reign
there
in
thy
turn
make
haste
then
to
learn
the
language
and
tell
me
in
thy
next
letter
of
the
progress
thou
hast
made
my
child
i
embrace
thee
tenderly
and
i
send
thee
with
thy
quarter
allowance
my
paternal
blessing
simons
leaned
toward
me
and
whispered
is
he
dictating
our
sentence
to
his
brigands
i
replied
no
madame
he
is
writing
to
his
daughter
concerning
our
capture
concerning
a
piano
a
crinoline
and
walter
scott
that
takes
a
long
time
will
he
invite
us
to
breakfast
there
comes
a
servant
with
refreshments
the
king
came
to
us
bringing
three
cups
of
coffee
a
box
of
and
a
pot
of
preserves
simons
and
her
daughter
rejected
the
beverage
with
disgust
because
it
was
made
like
turkish
coffee
and
was
like
thickened
milk
i
emptied
my
cup
like
a
veritable
gourmand
of
the
orient
the
pot
of
sweets
was
a
rose
sorbet
and
received
only
a
small
share
of
our
attention
as
we
were
forced
to
eat
it
with
one
spoon
delicate
eaters
are
unfortunate
when
in
this
country
of
primitive
simplicity
but
the
cut
in
pieces
pleased
the
palates
of
the
ladies
without
shocking
too
much
their
ordinary
tastes
they
took
in
their
beautiful
fingers
that
perfumed
jellied
paste
and
emptied
the
box
while
the
king
dictated
the
following
letter
messrs
barley
and
company
cavendish
square
london
i
see
by
your
honored
letter
of
the
of
april
and
the
current
account
which
accompanies
it
that
i
have
at
the
present
time
livres
sterling
to
my
credit
please
place
these
funds
half
in
english
three
per
cents
half
in
shares
of
the
company
before
the
coupons
are
cut
sell
my
shares
of
the
royal
britannic
bank
it
is
an
institution
in
which
i
have
no
longer
any
confidence
take
for
me
in
exchange
all
in
bank
of
london
if
you
can
get
livres
for
my
house
in
the
strand
it
was
valued
at
that
in
you
may
buy
for
me

the
an
equal
amount
send
to
the
firm
rhalli
brothers
guineas
it
is
my
subscription
for
the
hellenic
school
at
liverpool
i
have
seriously
pondered
the
proposition
which
you
have
done
me
the
honor
to
submit
to
me
and
after
many
reflections
i
have
decided
to
persist
in
my
line
of
conduct
and
transact
business
strictly
on
a
cash
basis
purchases
in
future
are
of
a
speculative
character
which
ought
to
prevent
any
good
father
of
a
family
from
dealing
in
them
i
am
assured
that
you
would
not
expose
my
capital
to
danger
and
would
use
it
with
a
prudence
which
has
always
characterized
your
house
but
even
where
the
benefit
of
which
you
write
seems
sure
i
experience
i
must
confess
it
a
certain
repugnance
to
leaving
to
my
heirs
a
fortune
augmented
by
gambling
accept
proprietor
is
it
about
us
whispered
not
yet
mademoiselle
his
majesty
is
investing
in
stocks
in
stocks
here
i
thought
that
was
only
done
at
home
is
monsieur
your
father
associated
with
a
banking
establishment
yes
with
the
firm
of
barley
are
there
two
bankers
of
the
same
name
in
london
not
that
i
am
aware
of
have
you
ever
heard
that
the
firm
transacted
business
with
the
orient
certainly
all
over
the
world
and
do
you
live
in
cavendish
square
no
the
offices
are
there
our
house
is
in
piccadilly
thank
you
mademoiselle
allow
me
to
listen
to
the
next
this
old
correspondence
is
very
interesting
the
king
dictated
without
stopping
a
long
report
of
the
shares
of
his
band
this
curious
document
was
addressed
to
georges
micrommati
officer
of
ordinance
at
the
palaces
that
he
might
read
it
in
the
general
assembly
to
those
interested
account
rendered
of
the
operations
of
the
national
company
by
the
king
of
the
mountains
receipts
and
expenditures
camp
of
the
king
april
sirs
the
agent
whom
you
have
honored
with
your
confidence
for
the
fourteenth
time
submits
for
your
approval
the
report
of
the
year
transactions
since
the
day
when
the
constitutional
act
of
our
society
was
signed
in
the
office
of
master
tsappas
royal
notary
of
athens
never
has
our
enterprise
encountered
more
obstacles
never
has
the
progress
of
our
labors
been
embarrassed
by
more
serious
difficulties
it
is
in
the
presence
of
a
strange
occupation
under
the
eyes
of
two
armies
if
not
hostile
at
least
that
the
regular
practice
of
an
eminently
national
institution
must
be
carried
on
piraeus
is
occupied
by
the
military
the
turkish
frontier
is
watched
with
a
zealousness
without
precedent
in
history
and
this
restricts
our
activity
to
a
very
narrow
circle
and
confines
our
zeal
to
impassable
limits
within
these
narrow
boundaries
our
resources
are
still
more
reduced
by
the
general
penury
the
scarcity
of
money
and
the
small
crops
the
olive
trees
have
not
yielded
as
they
promised
the
cereal
harvests
have
been
small
and
the
vines
are
not
yet
rid
of
the
oïdium
in
these
circumstances
it
has
been
difficult
to
profit
by
the
tolerance
of
the
authorities
and
the
kindness
of
a
friendly
government
our
enterprise
is
so
identified
with
the
interests
of
the
country
that
it
can
flourish
only
in
the
general
prosperity
and
so
repulse
the
counterstrokes
of
all
public
calamities
for
from
those
who
have
nothing
one
can
take
nothing
or
little
of
anything
the
strangers
traveling
in
this
country
whose
curiosity
is
so
useful
to
the
kingdom
and
to
us
have
become
rare
english
tourists
who
formerly
composed
an
important
branch
of
our
revenue
are
totally
lacking
two
young
americans
stopped
upon
the
road
to
pentelicus
lost
us
their
ransom
the
french
and
english
papers
had
inspired
them
with
a
spirit
of
defiance
and
they
escaped
from
our
hands
at
a
time
when
their
capture
would
have
been
most
useful
and
now
gentlemen
this
is
our
record
a
report
of
our
society
which
has
resisted
the
fatal
crisis
better
than
agriculture
industries
and
commerce
your
funds
confided
to
my
keeping
have
been
made
profitable
not
as
much
so
as
i
could
wish
but
better
than
any
one
could
hope
for
i
will
say
no
more
i
leave
the
figures
to
speak
for
themselves
arithmetic
is
more
eloquent
than
demosthenes
the
society
capital
limited
at
first
to
the
modest
sum
of
francs
has
increased
to
by
three
successive
issuings
of
bonds
of
francs
our
gross
receipts
from
may
to
april
are
francs

the
results
gentlemen
of
the
last
campaign
judge
what
the
future
will
be
when
our
country
and
our
operations
shall
be
free
from
the
foreign
power
which
presses
so
heavily
the
king
dictated
this
without
consulting
any
notes
without
hesitating
about
a
figure
and
without
stopping
to
choose
words
i
would
never
have
believed
that
an
old
man
of
his
age
could
have
possessed
so
remarkable
a
memory
he
appended
his
seal
to
the
three
letters
it
was
his
way
of
signing
he
read
easily
but
he
had
never
found
time
to
learn
to
write
charlemagne
and
alfred
the
great
were
it
is
said
in
the
same
predicament
while
the
of
state
were
transcribing
the
letters
for
the
day
in
order
to
place
them
in
the
archives
he
gave
audience
to
subaltern
officers
who
had
returned
with
their
detachments
from
the
day
duty
each
man
seated
himself
in
front
of
him
saluted
him
by
laying
his
right
hand
on
his
heart
and
making
his
report
in
a
few
words
i
swear
to
you
that
under
his
oak
inspired
no
greater
reverence
among
the
people
of
vincennes
the
first
who
presented
himself
was
a
small
man
with
a
bad
face
a
fine
sample
for
the
court
of
assizes
it
was
an
islander
from
corfu
persecuted
as
an
incendiary
he
had
been
well
brought
up
and
his
talents
had
advanced
him
but
his
chief
and
his
soldiers
held
him
in
no
great
esteem
he
was
suspected
of
keeping
for
his
own
profit
a
part
of
the
spoils
now
the
king
was
unreasonable
on
the
subject
of
probity
when
he
found
a
man
in
fault
he
ignominiously
thrust
him
out
and
ironically
said
to
him
go
and
make
a
magistrate
of
thyself
asked
the
man
from
corfu
what
hast
thou
done
i
have
just
come
with
my
fifteen
men
from
the
ravine
of
cirondelles
upon
the
road
to
thebes
i
met
a
detachment
of
soldiers
men
where
are
their
guns
i
left
them
they
were
percussion
muskets
which
would
not
serve
us
on
account
of
lack
of
caps
good
then
it
was
i
stopped
the
how
many
one
hundred
and
persons
and
thou
hast
brought
about
a
thousand
francs
naming
the
sum
seven
francs
per
head
it
is
small
it
is
good
they
were
peasants
they
had
not
then
sold
their
goods
some
had
sold
others
bought
the
man
opened
a
heavy
sack
which
he
carried
under
his
arm
he
spread
out
the
contents
before
the
secretaries
who
began
to
count
the
amount
the
receipts
were
from
thirty
to
forty
mexican
piastres
some
handfuls
of
austrian
zwanzigs
and
an
enormous
quantity
of
copper
coins
some
crumpled
papers
were
among
the
money
they
were
bank
notes
of
ten
francs
each
thou
hast
no
jewels
asked
the
king
no
were
there
no
women
then
i
found
nothing
worth
bringing
away
what
is
that
on
thy
finger
a
ring
gold
or
copper
i
do
not
know
which
where
didst
thou
get
it
i
bought
it
two
months
ago
if
thou
hadst
bought
it
thou
wouldst
know
whether
it
was
gold
or
copper
give
it
to
me
the
man
took
it
off
with
bad
grace
the
ring
was
immediately
locked
up
in
a
small
coffer
full
of
jewels
i
pardon
thee
said
the
king
because
of
thy
bad
education
the
people
of
thy
country
disgrace
theft
by
mixing
knavery
with
it
if
i
had
only
ionians
in
my
band
i
would
be
obliged
to
place
turnstiles
in
the
roads
as
they
do
at
the
exposition
in
london
so
that
i
might
count
the
visitors
and
the
money
the
next
he
who
came
forward
now
was
a
tall
young
man
and
with
a
most
pleasing
face
his
round
eyes
beamed
forth
rectitude
and
his
lips
with
a
pleasant
smile
showed
a
magnificent
set
of
teeth
i
was
greatly
taken
with
him
and
i
said
to
myself
that
if
he
had
been
led
astray
by
evil
associations
he
must
surely
return
some
day
to
the
right
path
my
face
must
have
pleased
him
for
he
saluted
me
very
politely
before
seating
himself
in
front
of
the
king
said
to
him
what
hast
thou
done
vasile
i
reached
pigadia
yesterday
evening
with
my
six
men
it
is
the
village
of
the
senator
zimbellis
well
zimbellis
was
absent
as
usual
but
his
relatives
his
farmers
and
his
tenants
were
all
at
home
and
in
bed
well
i
entered
an
inn
i
awakened
the
landlord
i
bought
bundles
of
straw
and
for
payment
i
killed
him
well
we
carried
the
straw
to
the
houses
and
spread
it
around
the
houses
are
of
wood
or
osier
and
we
set
fire
to
seven
places
at
once
the
matches
were
good
the
wind
from
the
north
everything
went
well
we
retired
quietly
to
the
wells
the
whole
village
awakened
and
rushed
out
shouting
the
men
came
running
with
their
leather
buckets
to
get
water
we
drowned
four
whom
we
did
not
know
the
others
escaped
well
we
returned
to
the
village
there
was
no
one
only
an
infant
forgotten
by
his
parents
and
who
cried
like
a
little
raven
fallen
from
its
nest
i
threw
him
into
a
burning
house
and
he
cried
no
more
well
then
we
took
and
placed
them
around
the
olive
trees
the
thing
was
we
then
started
for
the
camp
we
supped
and
slept
about
here
and
we
arrived
at
nine
in
prime
condition
without
even
a
burn
good
the
senator
zimbellis
will
not
discourse
against
us
again
the
next
vasile
withdrew
saluting
me
as
he
passed
as
politely
as
the
first
time
but
i
did
not
return
his
bow
he
was
soon
replaced
by
the
great
devil
who
had
taken
us
by
a
singular
caprice
of
chance
the
first
author
of
the
drama
in
which
i
was
called
to
play
a
part
was
named
sophocles
at
the
moment
when
he
began
his
report
i
felt
the
blood
congeal
in
my
veins
i
supplicated
simons
not
to
risk
an
imprudent
word
she
replied
that
she
was
english
and
that
she
knew
how
to
behave
herself
the
king
asked
us
to
be
silent
and
allow
the
man
to
speak
he
first
spread
out
the
booty
which
he
had
taken
from
us
then
he
drew
from
his
belt
forty
austrian
ducats
which
made
a
sum
of
four
hundred
and
seventy
francs
at
the
rate
of
the
ducats
he
said
came
from
the
village
of
castia
the
rest
was
taken
from
these
nobles
thou
didst
tell
me
to
scour
the
boundaries
i
began
with
the
village
thou
hast
not
done
well
replied
the
king
the
people
of
castia
are
our
neighbors
they
must
not
be
molested
how
can
we
live
in
safety
if
we
have
enemies
at
our
door
moreover
they
were
brave
people
who
have
given
us
aid
when
occasion
demanded
oh
i
took
nothing
from
the
charcoal
burners
they
disappeared
into
the
woods
without
giving
me
time
to
speak
to
them
but
the
padre
had
the
gout
i
found
him
at
home
what
didst
thou
say
to
him
i
asked
him
for
his
money
he
insisted
that
he
had
none
i
shut
him
up
in
a
sack
with
his
cat
and
i
do
not
know
what
the
cat
did
but
he
began
to
cry
out
that
his
treasure
was
behind
the
house
under
a
huge
stone
thou
wert
wrong
the
padre
will
incite
all
the
village
against
us
oh
no
in
leaving
him
i
forgot
to
open
the
sack
and
the
cat
ought
to
have
fixed
him
by
this
time
all
in
good
time
but
listen
to
me
well
all
of
you
i
do
not
wish
anyone
to
trouble
our
neighbors
thou
mayst
retire
our
examination
now
began
instead
of
having
us
come
to
him
gravely
rose
came
and
seated
himself
on
the
ground
in
front
of
us
this
mark
of
deference
to
us
seemed
a
favorable
augury
simons
prepared
to
question
him
herself
as
for
me
perceiving
too
well
what
she
was
capable
of
saying
and
knowing
the
intemperance
of
her
tongue
i
offered
my
services
to
the
king
as
interpreter
he
thanked
me
coldly
and
called
the
corfuan
who
knew
english
madame
the
king
said
to
simons
you
seem
to
be
in
great
anger
have
you
any
complaints
to
make
of
the
men
who
brought
you
here
it
is
a
horror
she
cried
your
rascals
have
arrested
dragged
me
through
the
dirt
despoiled
me
worn
me
out
and
starved
me
will
you
accept
my
excuses
i
am
forced
to
employ
men
without
education
believe
me
my
dear
madame
it
is
not
by
my
orders
they
have
acted
thus
you
are
english
an
englishwoman
from
london
i
have
been
to
london
i
know
and
esteem
the
english
i
know
that
they
have
good
appetites
and
you
noticed
that
i
was
moved
to
offer
you
refreshments
i
know
that
ladies
of
your
country
do
not
like
to
run
over
rocks
and
i
regret
that
you
were
not
allowed
to
walk
your
own
gait
i
know
that
people
of
your
nation
carry
while
traveling
only
such
things
as
are
necessary
and
i
have
not
yet
pardoned
sophocles
for
having
robbed
you
above
all
if
you
are
a
person
of
distinction
i
belong
to
the
best
society
of
london
deign
to
take
back
your
money

is
yours

my
daughter

that

to
your
daughter

very
rich
very
rich

things

son
monsieur
is
not
my
son

is
a
german
since
i
am
english
how
could
i
have
a
german
son
that
is
true
have
you
twenty
thousand
francs
income
more
a
carpet
for
these
ladies
are
you
rich
enough
to
have
thirty
thousand
francs
income
we
have
more
than
that
sophocles
is
a
villain
whom
i
shall
chastise
logothète
tell
them
to
prepare
dinner
for
these
ladies
may
it
be
possible
madame
that
you
are
a
millionaire
i
am
that
and
i
i
am
annoyed
at
the
way
in
which
you
have
been
treated
you
have
without
doubt
fine
friends
in
athens
i
know
the
english
minister
oh
madame
you
also
know
some
merchants
some
bankers
my
brother
who
is
at
athens
knows
many
bankers
in
the
city
i
am
delighted
sophocles
come
here
ask
pardon
of
these
ladies
sophocles
muttered
some
words
between
his
teeth
i
know
not
what
excuses
the
king
replied
these
ladies
are
englishwomen
of
distinction
they
are
worth
a
million
or
more
they
have
been
received
by
the
english
ambassador
their
brother
who
is
in
athens
knows
all
the
bankers
in
the
city
that
is
right
cried
simons
the
king
continued
thou
shouldst
have
treated
these
ladies
with
all
the
regard
due
their
fortune
good
simons
cried
have
conducted
them
here
carefully
for
what
purpose
murmured
and
abstained
from
touching
their
baggage
when
one
has
the
honor
of
meeting
in
the
mountains
two
persons
of
the
rank
of
these
ladies
one
should
salute
them
with
respect
one
should
bring
them
to
the
camp
with
deference
one
should
guard
them
circumspectly
and
one
should
offer
them
politely
every
necessary
thing
in
life
until
their
brother
or
their
ambassador
sends
us
a
ransom
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
poor
simons
dear
neither
expected
this
termination
as
for
me
i
was
not
surprised
i
knew
with
what
a
crafty
knave
we
had
to
do
i
took
up
the
word
and
i
said
to
him
fiercely
thou
canst
keep
what
thy
men
have
taken
from
me
because
it
is
all
that
thou
wilt
get
from
me
i
am
poor
my
father
has
nothing
my
brothers
often
eat
dry
bread
i
know
neither
bankers
nor
ambassadors
and
if
thou
keepest
me
with
the
hope
of
a
ransom
thou
wilt
reap
no
reward
i
swear
it
to
thee
a
murmur
of
incredulity
was
heard
but
the
king
appeared
to
believe
me
if
that
is
true
he
said
to
me
i
will
not
keep
you
i
will
send
you
back
to
the
city
madame
will
give
you
a
letter
for
monsieur
her
brother
and
you
may
even
leave
if
however
you
need
to
remain
a
day
or
two
in
the
mountains
i
will
offer
my
hospitality
to
you
because
i
suppose
that
you
have
not
come
as
far
as
this
with
this
large
box
in
order
to
look
over
the
country
this
little
speech
gave
me
a
profound
feeling
of
relief
i
looked
around
with
satisfaction
the
king
his
secretaries
and
his
soldiers
seemed
less
terrible
the
surrounding
rocks
more
picturesque
since
i
viewed
them
with
the
eye
of
a
guest
and
not
as
a
prisoner
the
desire
i
had
experienced
to
see
athens
suddenly
subsided
and
i
decided
to
pass
two
or
three
days
in
the
mountains
i
felt
that
my
counsels
would
not
be
useless
to
mother
the
good
woman
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
which
might
urge
her
to
do
something
rash
if
perchance
she
determined
to
refuse
to
pay
the
ransom
before
england
could
come
to
her
aid
she
would
have
ample
time
to
draw
dire
calamity
upon
her
charming
head
i
must
not
leave
her
until
i
had
an
opportunity
to
relate
the
history
of
mistra
little
daughters
shall
i
say
more
you
know
my
passion
for
botany
the
flora
of
parnassus
is
very
enticing
at
the
end
of
april
one
can
find
in
the
mountains
five
or
six
plants
as
rare
as
they
are
celebrated
one
especially
boryana
variabilis
discovered
and
named
by
bory
de
should
i
leave
such
a
lacuna
and
present
my
herbarium
to
the
museum
of
hamburg
without
the
boryana
variabilis
i
replied
to
the
king
i
accept
thy
hospitality
but
on
one
condition
what
is
it
that
thou
wilt
return
my
box
oh
well
so
be
it
and
the
condition
that
is
it
will
you
tell
me
of
what
use
it
is
to
you
to
hold
the
plants
which
i
pick
and
why
do
you
search
for
plants
to
sell
them
nonsense
i
am
not
a
merchant
i
am
a
savant
he
held
out
his
hand
to
me
and
said
with
visible
joy
i
am
charmed
science
is
a
beautiful
thing
our
ancestors
were
wise
men
our
grandchildren
will
be
perhaps
as
for
us
time
is
lacking
savants
are
much
esteemed
in
your
country
greatly
one
gives
them
rank
sometimes
one
pays
them
well
enough
one
attaches
a
little
ribbon
to
their
coat
occasionally
is
it
true
that
cities
dispute
as
to
which
they
belong
it
is
true
in
germany
and
one
looks
upon
their
death
as
a
public
calamity
assuredly
what
you
tell
me
gives
me
great
pleasure
then
you
have
no
complaints
to
make
of
your
very
much
to
the
contrary
it
is
through
their
liberality
that
i
was
enabled
to
come
to
greece
you
travel
at
their
expense
yes
you
are
i
am
a
doctor
it
is
the
highest
grade
in
science
no
and
how
many
doctors
are
there
in
the
city
in
which
you
live
i
do
not
know
exactly
but
not
as
many
doctors
in
hamburg
as
generals
in
athens
oh
oh
i
would
not
deprive
your
country
of
a
man
so
rare
you
shall
return
to
hamburg
monsieur
doctor
what
would
they
say
down
below
if
they
knew
that
you
were
a
prisoner
up
here
in
the
mountains
they
would
say
that
it
was
a
misfortune
good
rather
than
lose
such
a
man
as
you
the
city
of
hamburg
would
sacrifice
fifteen
thousand
francs
take
back
your
box
haste
away
search
gather
plants
and
follow
your
studies
why
not
put
that
silver
watch
back
in
your
pocket
it
is
yours
and
i
respect
savants
too
much
to
rob
them
but
your
country
is
rich
enough
to
pay
for
her
glory
happy
young
man
you
recognize
how
much
the
title
of
doctor
adds
to
your
personal
value
i
would
not
have
demanded
a
centime
of
ransom
if
you
had
been
as
ignorant
as
i
am
the
king
listened
neither
to
my
objections
nor
to
expostulations
he
closed
the
interview
and
pointed
out
to
us
the
dining
hall
simons
descended
to
the
place
all
the
while
protesting
that
although
she
would
eat
her
breakfast
yet
she
would
never
pay
the
bill
seemed
more
depressed
but
such
is
the
mobility
of
youth
that
she
cried
out
with
joy
when
she
saw
the
place
where
our
meal
was
spread
it
was
a
little
corner
of
green
sheltered
by
gray
rocks
beautiful
grass
formed
the
carpet
some
clumps
of
privet
and
laurels
served
as
hangings
and
hid
the
rocky
walls
a
beautiful
blue
arch
was
above
our
heads
birds
flew
back
and
forth
in
the
azure
vault
in
a
corner
of
our
a
limpid
stream
clear
as
crystal
silently
swept
along
in
its
course
spreading
over
its
banks
and
falling
in
a
silvery
sheet
down
the
side
of
the
mountain
from
this
side
the
view
illimitably
extended
to
the
sides
of
the
pentelicus
the
great
white
pile
which
overhangs
athens
across
the
olive
groves
the
dusty
plain
the
gray
sides
of
hymettus
rounded
like
an
old
man
spine
and
that
beautiful
saronic
gulf
so
blue
that
one
might
say
that
a
strip
had
fallen
from
the
sky
assuredly
simons
had
not
a
mind
turned
to
admiration
and
yet
she
confessed
that
the
price
for
such
a
beautiful
sight
would
be
very
high
in
london
or
paris
the
table
was
laid
with
heroic
simplicity
brown
bread
baked
in
a
field
oven
smoked
upon
the
sod
and
gave
out
a
most
appetizing
odor
the
clotted
milk
quivered
in
a
huge
wooden
bowl
the
large
olives
and
green
piments
were
laid
on
roughly
cut
pieces
of
wood
a
shaggy
bottle
spread
out
its
large
sides
next
to
a
red
copper
cup
roughly
chiseled
an
cheese
reposed
upon
the
cloth
which
had
pressed
it
and
which
still
bore
its
imprint
five
or
six
appetizing
lettuces
promised
us
a
delicious
salad
but
there
were
no
condiments
with
which
to
dress
them
the
king
had
placed
his
traveling
plate
at
our
disposal
consisting
of
spoons
cut
out
with
a
knife
and
we
had
as
a
surfeit
of
luxury
our
five
fingers
for
forks
they
had
not
been
tolerant
enough
to
serve
us
with
meat
but
the
yellow
tobacco
of
almyros
promised
me
an
admirable
digester
one
of
the
king
officers
served
us
it
was
the
hideous
corfuan
the
man
of
the
gold
ring
who
knew
english
he
cut
the
bread
with
his
poniard
and
distributed
it
freely
praying
us
not
to
lack
for
anything
simons
without
losing
one
stroke
of
her
teeth
said
to
him
in
a
haughty
tone
monsieur
does
your
master
seriously
believe
that
we
shall
pay
a
ransom
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
he
is
sure
of
it
it
is
because
he
does
not
know
the
english
nation
he
knows
it
well
madame
and
i
also
at
corfu
i
have
associated
with
many
distinguished
englishmen
judges
i
wish
you
joy
of
it
but
tell
this
stavros
to
arm
himself
with
patience
because
he
will
wait
a
long
time
for
the
hundred
thousand
francs
which
he
has
promised
himself
he
told
me
to
tell
you
that
he
would
wait
for
them
until
the
of
may
at
noon
precisely
and
if
we
have
not
paid
it
the
of
may
at
noon
he
will
regret
that
he
will
be
obliged
to
cut
off
your
head
as
well
as
mademoiselle
dropped
the
bread
which
she
was
carrying
to
her
mouth
give
me
a
little
wine
she
said
the
bandit
handed
to
her
a
cup
full
but
scarcely
had
it
touched
her
lips
before
she
cried
out
with
fear
the
poor
child
imagined
that
the
wine
was
poisoned
i
reassured
her
by
emptying
the
cup
at
one
draught
fear
nothing
i
said
to
her
it
is
the
resin
what
resin
wine
would
not
keep
in
these
if
a
certain
amount
of
resin
was
not
added
to
prevent
it
from
spoiling
the
mixture
is
not
very
agreeable
but
you
may
drink
it
without
fear
despite
my
example
and
her
mother
made
the
bandit
bring
water
the
man
ran
to
the
brook
and
was
back
in
an
instant
you
understand
mesdames
he
smilingly
said
that
the
king
would
not
be
foolish
enough
to
poison
such
valuable
people
as
you
are
he
added
turning
to
me
you
le
docteur
i
have
orders
to
tell
you
that
you
have
thirty
days
to
pursue
your
studies
and
pay
the
sum
i
will
furnish
you
all
with
writing
materials
thanks
simons
said
we
will
think
of
it
in
eight
days
if
we
are
not
delivered
before
and
by
whom
madame
by
england
is
it
far
or
by
the
police
for
your
sake
i
hope
you
may
have
that
luck
in
the
meantime
i
will
do
anything
in
my
power
for
you
i
wish
first
for
a
we
have
near
here
a
grotto
which
is
called
les
etables
you
would
not
like
it
the
sheep
were
kept
there
during
the
winter
and
the
odor
still
remains
i
will
get
two
tents
from
the
shepherds
below
and
you
can
camp
here
until
the
arrival
of
the
gendarmes
i
wish
for
a
nothing
is
easier
our
men
will
go
down
to
the
plain
and
stop
the
first
who
passes
if
however
the
gendarmerie
will
permit
i
must
have
clothes
dresses
linen
toilet
appurtenances
soap
a
mirror
combs
scents
a
tapestry
frame
a
a
good
many
things
madame
and
in
order
to
get
them
all
we
would
be
forced
to
go
to
athens
but
one
will
do
the
best
count
on
me
and
count
not
too
much
on
your
soldiers
may
god
pity
us
said
a
vigorous
echo
replied
kyrie
eleison
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
it
was
the
good
old
man
who
came
to
visit
us
and
who
sang
while
traveling
about
in
order
to
keep
in
practice
he
saluted
us
cordially
placed
upon
the
grass
a
vessel
full
of
honey
and
seated
himself
near
us
take
and
eat
he
said
my
bees
offer
you
a
dessert
i
shook
hands
with
him
simons
and
turned
away
in
disgust
they
obstinately
refused
to
see
him
in
any
other
light
than
as
an
accomplice
of
the
brigands
the
poor
good
man
knew
no
malice
he
knew
only
how
to
chant
his
prayers
to
care
for
his
bees
to
sell
his
goods
to
collect
the
revenues
of
the
convent
and
to
live
at
peace
with
the
whole
world
his
intelligence
was
limited
his
science
nothing
his
conduct
as
innocent
as
that
of
a
machine
i
do
not
believe
that
he
was
able
to
clearly
distinguish
good
from
bad
and
to
see
any
difference
between
a
thief
and
an
honest
man
his
wisdom
consisted
in
making
four
meals
a
day
and
of
never
getting
more
than
over
he
was
moreover
one
of
the
best
monks
of
his
order
i
did
full
justice
to
the
present
he
had
brought
us
this
honey
resembled
the
kind
which
we
eat
in
france
as
the
flesh
of
a
roe
resembles
lamb
meat
one
would
have
said
that
the
bees
had
distilled
in
an
invisible
alembic
all
the
perfumes
of
the
mountains
i
forgot
in
eating
my
bread
spread
with
the
honey
that
i
had
only
a
month
in
which
to
find
fifteen
thousand
francs
or
die
the
monk
in
his
turn
asked
permission
to
refresh
himself
a
little
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
took
the
cup
and
turned
out
a
bumper
he
drank
successively
to
each
of
us
five
or
six
brigands
drawn
by
curiosity
glided
into
the
nook
he
spoke
to
each
by
name
and
drank
to
each
in
a
spirit
of
justice
it
was
not
long
before
i
cursed
his
presence
an
hour
after
his
arrival
half
the
band
was
seated
in
a
circle
around
our
viands
in
the
absence
of
the
king
who
was
taking
a
siesta
in
his
office
the
brigands
came
one
by
one
to
cultivate
our
acquaintance
one
offered
his
services
another
brought
us
something
still
a
third
introduced
himself
without
pretext
and
without
embarrassment
as
a
man
who
felt
himself
at
home
the
more
familiar
besought
me
to
relate
our
history
the
more
timid
held
back
at
first
but
insensibly
drew
nearer
some
having
satisfied
themselves
with
looking
at
us
threw
themselves
down
without
courtesy
for
the
ladies
presence
and
immediately
began
to
snore
and
the
fleas
always
flying
about
and
the
presence
of
their
original
master
rendering
them
so
bold
that
i
surprised
two
or
three
of
them
on
the
back
of
my
hand
impossible
to
dispute
their
right
to
a
grazing
ground
i
was
no
more
a
man
but
a
common
pasture
at
this
moment
i
would
have
given
three
of
the
most
beautiful
plants
in
my
herbarium
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
solitude
simons
and
her
daughter
were
too
discreet
to
impart
to
me
their
views
but
they
proved
by
some
involuntary
starts
that
we
were
of
a
community
of
ideas
i
even
surprised
a
look
between
them
which
seemed
to
say
the
gendarmes
will
deliver
us
from
the
thieves
but
who
can
deliver
us
from
these
fleas
this
mute
complaint
awoke
in
my
heart
a
chivalrous
sentiment
i
resolutely
rose
and
said
go
away
all
of
you
the
king
has
sent
us
here
to
live
quietly
until
the
arrival
of
our
ransoms
the
rent
is
so
high
that
we
have
a
right
to
remain
alone
are
you
not
ashamed
to
crowd
around
a
table
like
parasitical
dogs
you
have
no
business
here
we
have
no
use
for
you
we
do
not
want
you
here
do
you
believe
that
we
can
escape
how
by
the
cascade
or
past
the
king
cabinet
leave
us
then
in
peace
corfuan
drive
them
away
and
i
will
help
you
if
you
wish
i
added
action
to
the
word
i
shoved
along
the
loiterers
i
awakened
the
sleepers
i
shook
the
monk
i
forced
the
corfuan
to
aid
me
and
soon
the
troop
of
brigands
a
troop
armed
with
poniards
and
pistols
gave
up
to
us
the
place
with
meekness
although
kicking
taking
short
steps
resisting
with
the
shoulders
and
twisting
the
head
in
the
fashion
of
who
have
to
be
pushed
into
the
schoolroom
when
recreation
is
over
at
last
we
were
alone
with
the
corfuan
i
said
to
mistress
simons
madame
this
is
our
house
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
separate
the
apartment
into
two
divisions
i
must
have
a
little
corner
for
my
tent
behind
those
trees
i
shall
not
be
badly
off
and
all
the
rest
is
yours
if
that
pleases
you
you
will
have
the
brook
at
hand
my
offers
were
accepted
with
sufficiently
bad
grace
these
ladies
would
have
liked
to
keep
all
and
let
me
go
to
sleep
with
the
thieves
it
is
true
that
british
conventions
might
have
gained
something
by
this
separation
but
i
would
have
lost
sight
of
and
moreover
i
had
decided
to
sleep
far
from
the
fleas
the
corfuan
approved
of
my
proposition
which
rendered
his
watch
less
difficult
he
had
orders
to
guard
us
night
and
day
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
sleep
near
my
tent
but
i
exacted
the
condition
of
a
distance
of
six
english
feet
between
us
the
treaty
concluded
i
established
myself
in
a
corner
to
give
chase
to
my
domestic
game
but
i
had
scarcely
begun
before
the
curious
bandits
appeared
under
pretext
of
bringing
our
tents
simons
fairly
screamed
when
she
saw
that
her
house
was
composed
of
a
simple
strip
of
heavy
felt
pleated
in
the
middle
fastened
to
the
earth
at
the
two
ends
and
opened
to
the
wind
on
two
sides
the
corfuan
swore
that
we
should
be
lodged
like
princes
save
in
case
of
rain
or
a
strong
wind
the
entire
band
began
to
drive
in
stakes
to
fix
our
beds
and
to
bring
each
bed
was
composed
of
a
rug
with
a
covering
made
of
at
six
the
king
came
to
assure
himself
with
his
own
eyes
that
we
lacked
nothing
simons
more
incensed
than
ever
replied
that
she
lacked
everything
i
formally
asked
for
the
exclusion
of
all
useless
visitors
the
king
established
severe
regulations
such
as
we
had
never
followed
discipline
is
a
french
word
hard
to
translate
in
greek
the
king
and
his
subjects
retired
at
seven
and
we
were
to
be
served
then
with
supper
four
torches
of
resinous
wood
lighted
the
table
their
red
and
smoky
light
strangely
colored
miss
simons
pale
face
her
eyes
seemed
to
flash
become
dim
and
rekindle
again
like
a
revolving
her
voice
weakened
by
fatigue
took
on
at
intervals
a
discordant
tone
in
listening
to
her
my
mind
seemed
to
wander
in
a
supernatural
world
and
i
remembered
some
very
fantastic
tales
which
i
had
once
read
a
nightingale
sang
and
i
believed
i
saw
its
silvery
song
pouring
from
lips
the
day
had
been
a
hard
one
for
all
and
even
i
who
had
given
substantial
proof
of
my
appetite
soon
recognized
the
fact
that
i
was
famished
only
for
sleep
i
said
to
the
ladies
and
retired
to
my
tent
in
an
instant
i
forgot
nightingale
danger
ransom
stings
i
closed
my
eyes
and
i
slept
a
fearful
discharge
of
musketry
awoke
me
with
a
start
i
jumped
up
so
quickly
that
i
struck
my
head
against
the
poles
of
my
tent
at
the
same
moment
i
heard
two
feminine
voices
crying
we
are
saved
the
gendarmes
i
saw
two
or
three
indistinct
forms
rush
by
in
the
night
in
my
joy
in
my
trouble
i
embraced
the
first
shadow
which
passed
my
tent
it
was
the
corfuan
halt
he
cried
where
are
you
running
if
you
please
dog
of
a
thief
i
replied
i
am
going
to
see
if
the
gendarmes
will
soon
finish
shooting
your
comrades
simons
and
her
daughter
guided
by
my
voice
came
up
to
us
the
man
said
to
us
the
gendarmes
will
not
travel
it
is
the
ascension
and
the
of
may
a
double
the
noise
which
you
have
heard
is
the
signal
for
rejoicing
it
is
after
midnight
almost
morning
our
companions
go
to
drink
wine
eat
meat
dance
the
romaique
and
burn
powder
if
you
wish
to
see
this
beautiful
sight
it
will
give
me
pleasure
to
take
you
to
it
i
can
guard
you
more
agreeably
around
the
roast
than
at
the
fountain
here
you
lie
cried
simons
it
is
the
gendarmes
let
us
go
and
see
added
i
followed
them
the
tumult
was
so
great
that
one
could
not
have
slept
if
one
had
wished
our
guide
led
us
through
the
king
cabinet
and
we
climbed
to
the
bandit
camp
which
was
all
ablaze
with
light
whole
pine
trees
placed
at
intervals
were
used
as
torches
five
or
six
groups
seated
around
a
huge
fire
watched
the
lambs
roasting
on
spits
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
a
line
of
dancers
wound
slowly
around
in
serpentine
fashion
to
the
measures
of
most
frightful
music
occasional
volleys
of
musketry
were
heard
once
it
came
quite
near
us
and
i
felt
the
whizzing
of
a
ball
close
to
my
ear
i
begged
the
ladies
to
hasten
forward
hoping
that
near
the
king
we
would
be
farther
from
danger
the
king
seated
on
his
everlasting
carpet
presided
with
due
solemnity
over
the
diversions
of
his
people
around
him
were
bottles
the
sheep
were
cut
up
and
each
man
took
a
leg
or
shoulder
and
carried
it
about
in
his
hands
the
orchestra
was
composed
of
a
rude
tambourine
and
a
shrill
flageolet
the
dancers
had
taken
off
their
shoes
in
order
to
be
more
agile
they
flounced
and
jumped
all
over
the
spot
and
came
near
cracking
their
bones
sometimes
from
time
to
time
they
left
the
dance
drank
a
cup
of
wine
ate
a
piece
of
meat
discharged
a
gun
and
then
returned
to
the
dance
all
these
men
except
the
king
drank
ate
hurled
themselves
about
and
jumped
i
saw
not
one
of
them
even
smile
courteously
excused
himself
for
having
awakened
us
it
is
not
i
who
am
to
blame
it
is
the
custom
if
the
first
of
may
passed
without
a
discharge
of
musketry
these
worthy
people
would
not
believe
that
spring
had
come
i
have
here
only
simple
people
brought
up
in
the
country
and
attached
to
ancient
customs
i
have
done
the
best
for
their
education
that
i
could
do
but
i
shall
die
before
they
become
civilized
men
can
not
be
made
over
in
a
day
like
silver
forks
and
spoons
even
i
such
as
you
see
me
have
found
pleasure
in
these
gross
sports
i
have
eaten
and
drunk
and
danced
like
the
others
i
have
never
known
european
civilization
why
should
i
take
the
trouble
to
travel
so
late
in
life
i
would
give
much
to
be
young
and
only
fifty
again
i
have
ideas
of
reform
which
will
never
be
executed
i
see
myself
like
alexander
without
an
heir
worthy
of
me
i
dream
of
a
new
organization
of
brigandage
without
disorder
without
turbulence
and
without
noise
but
i
have
no
one
to
second
me
i
ought
to
have
the
exact
census
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
kingdom
with
an
approximate
statement
of
their
wealth
personal
and
real
as
for
the
strangers
who
land
on
our
shores
an
agent
established
at
each
port
would
learn
and
send
to
me
their
names
their
itinerary
and
as
nearly
as
possible
their
fortune
in
this
way
i
would
know
what
each
one
could
give
me
and
i
would
not
make
the
mistake
of
asking
too
little
or
too
much
i
would
establish
on
each
road
a
post
with
proper
clerks
well
and
well
educated
because
for
what
good
to
frighten
clients
with
disgusting
behavior
or
a
surly
mien
i
have
seen
in
france
and
in
england
thieves
elegant
to
excess
and
did
they
not
certainly
succeed
better
because
of
it
i
would
demand
of
all
my
subordinates
exquisite
manners
above
all
from
those
whose
business
it
was
to
accost
people
i
would
have
for
prisoners
of
distinction
like
you
comfortable
quarters
in
the
open
air
with
fine
gardens
and
do
not
think
that
they
would
cost
the
occupants
more
dearly
to
the
contrary
if
all
those
who
traveled
in
this
country
were
necessarily
to
fall
into
my
hands
i
could
tax
the
for
a
very
insignificant
sum
so
that
each
nation
and
each
traveler
would
give
me
only
a
fourth
per
cent
on
their
principals
i
would
gain
upon
the
quantity
then
brigandage
would
only
be
a
tax
on
the
circulation
a
just
tax
because
it
would
be
proportional
a
normal
tax
because
it
had
always
been
collected
since
ancient
times
we
could
simplify
it
if
necessary
by
yearly
subscriptions
in
consideration
of
a
sum
once
paid
one
could
obtain
safe
conduct
for
the
natives
and
an
indorsed
for
travelers
you
say
that
according
to
the
terms
of
the
constitution
no
tax
could
be
imposed
without
the
vote
of
the
chambers
ah
monsieur
if
i
only
had
time
i
would
buy
the
whole
senate
i
would
nominate
a
chamber
of
deputies
friendly
to
me
a
law
would
be
passed
in
a
trice
one
could
create
if
necessary
a
ministry
of
the
highway
that
might
cost
me
two
or
three
millions
at
first
but
in
four
years
i
could
square
myself
and
i
could
keep
the
roads
in
order
into
the
bargain
he
sighed
heavily
then
he
said
you
see
with
what
freedom
i
have
spoken
to
you
it
is
an
old
habit
of
which
i
can
never
break
myself
i
have
lived
always
in
the
open
air
and
in
the
sunlight
our
profession
would
be
shameful
if
exercised
clandestinely
i
hide
nothing
about
myself
but
i
fear
no
one
when
you
read
in
the
papers
that
search
is
being
made
for
me
say
without
hesitation
that
it
is
a
parliamentary
fiction
it
is
always
known
where
i
am
i
fear
neither
ministers
the
army
nor
the
tribunals
the
ministers
know
that
by
a
gesture
i
can
change
a
cabinet
the
army
is
on
my
side
it
furnishes
me
with
recruits
when
i
need
them
i
receive
from
it
soldiers
i
return
officers
as
for
messieurs
the
judges
they
know
my
opinion
of
them
i
do
not
esteem
them
but
i
pity
them
poor
and
badly
recompensed
one
can
not
expect
them
to
be
honest
i
have
fed
some
and
clothed
others
i
have
hung
very
few
in
my
life
i
am
then
the
benefactor
of
the
magistracy
he
pointed
out
to
me
with
a
magnificent
gesture
the
sky
the
sea
the
country
all
that
said
he
is
mine
every
breathing
thing
in
the
kingdom
submits
to
me
through
fear
friendship
or
admiration
i
have
made
many
weep
and
there
is
not
one
mother
who
would
wish
to
have
a
son
like
a
day
will
come
when
doctors
like
you
will
write
my
history
and
when
the
isles
of
the
archipelago
will
dispute
the
honor
of
my
birthplace
my
portrait
will
hang
on
the
walls
of
the
houses
to
keep
company
with
the
sacred
images
in
the
niches
at
that
time
my
daughter
grandchildren
will
be
reigning
princes
who
will
speak
with
pride
of
their
ancestor
the
king
of
the
mountains
perhaps
you
will
laugh
at
my
german
simplicity
but
this
strange
discourse
moved
me
profoundly
i
admired
in
spite
of
myself
this
grandeur
in
crime
i
had
not
until
then
ever
met
a
majestic
rascal
this
devil
of
a
man
who
might
cut
off
my
head
at
the
end
of
a
month
almost
inspired
me
with
respect
his
grand
face
as
if
carved
from
marble
serene
in
the
midst
of
the
orgies
seemed
to
me
like
an
inflexible
mask
of
destiny
i
could
not
restrain
myself
from
saying
yes
you
are
truly
a
king
he
smilingly
answered
in
truth
then
i
have
flatterers
even
among
my
enemies
do
not
defend
yourself
i
can
read
faces
and
you
have
looked
at
me
since
morning
as
if
you
would
like
to
hang
me
since
you
have
asked
me
to
be
frank
i
confess
that
i
have
been
angry
you
have
asked
me
a
most
unreasonable
ransom
that
you
can
take
a
hundred
thousand
francs
from
these
ladies
who
have
them
is
a
very
natural
thing
and
what
might
be
expected
of
you
but
that
you
should
exact
fifteen
thousand
from
me
who
has
nothing
it
is
outrageous
nothing
however
is
more
simple
all
strangers
who
come
here
are
rich
because
traveling
costs
you
pretend
that
you
are
not
traveling
at
your
own
expenses
i
would
like
to
believe
you
but
those
who
have
sent
you
here
give
you
at
least
three
or
four
thousand
francs
yearly
if
they
go
to
this
expense
they
have
their
reasons
because
one
does
nothing
for
nothing
you
represent
in
their
eyes
a
capital
of
sixty
to
eighty
thousand
francs
then
in
ransoming
you
for
fifteen
thousand
they
gain
by
it
but
the
establishment
which
pays
me
has
no
capital
it
has
only
revenues
the
appropriation
for
the
jardin
des
plantes
is
voted
every
year
by
the
senate
its
resources
are
limited
one
has
never
known
a
parallel
case
i
know
not
how
to
explain
it
to
you
you
could
not
comprehend
and
when
i
did
comprehend
it
he
replied
in
a
haughty
tone
do
you
believe
that
i
would
take
back
what
i
have
said
my
words
are
laws
if
i
wish
to
have
them
respected
i
must
not
violate
them
myself
i
have
a
right
to
be
unjust
i
have
not
the
right
to
be
weak
my
injustices
injure
others
a
weakness
would
ruin
me
if
i
was
known
to
be
exorable
my
prisoners
would
endeavor
to
find
prayers
to
win
me
instead
of
endeavoring
to
find
money
to
pay
me
i
am
not
one
of
your
european
brigands
who
are
a
medley
of
sternness
and
generosity
of
speculation
and
imprudence
of
cruelty
without
cause
and
comparison
without
excuse
in
order
to
end
foolishly
on
the
scaffold
i
have
said
before
witnesses
that
i
must
have
fifteen
thousand
francs
for
your
head
arrange
it
to
suit
yourself
but
in
some
way
or
other
i
must
be
paid
listen
in
i
condemned
two
little
girls
who
were
the
age
of
my
dear
photini
they
held
out
their
arms
to
me
weeping
and
their
cries
made
my
fatherly
heart
bleed
vasile
who
killed
them
tried
many
times
his
hand
trembled
and
yet
i
was
inflexible
because
the
ransom
was
not
paid
do
you
think
after
that
that
i
would
show
you
grace
what
purpose
would
it
have
served
me
to
kill
them
the
poor
things
if
one
learned
that
i
sent
you
away
for
nothing
i
dropped
my
head
without
a
word
in
reply
i
had
a
thousand
reasons
but
i
knew
not
how
to
oppose
them
to
the
pitiless
logic
of
this
old
executioner
he
aroused
me
from
my
reflections
with
a
friendly
tap
on
the
shoulder
have
courage
he
said
to
me
i
have
seen
death
nearer
to
me
than
you
are
and
i
carried
myself
like
an
oak
during
the
war
of
independence
ibrahim
ordered
me
to
be
shot
by
seven
egyptians
six
balls
failed
of
their
duty
the
seventh
struck
me
on
the
forehead
and
glanced
off
when
the
turks
came
to
pick
up
my
body
i
had
disappeared
in
the
smoke
you
have
perhaps
a
longer
time
to
live
than
you
think
you
have
write
to
your
friends
in
hamburg
you
have
received
an
education
a
doctor
ought
to
have
friends
worth
more
than
fifteen
thousand
francs
i
really
wish
so
i
do
not
hate
you
you
have
never
harmed
me
your
death
would
cause
me
no
pleasure
and
it
would
please
me
to
believe
that
you
will
find
the
means
for
paying
the
money
while
waiting
go
and
remain
with
the
ladies
my
people
may
drink
a
drop
too
much
and
they
look
upon
the
english
with
eyes
that
say
nothing
good
these
poor
devils
are
condemned
to
an
austere
life
and
they
are
not
seventy
years
old
as
i
am
in
ordinary
times
i
can
keep
them
obedient
by
fatigue
but
it
is
different
in
an
hour
i
can
not
answer
for
them
in
truth
a
menacing
circle
had
already
formed
itself
around
who
looked
at
these
strange
figures
with
innocent
curiosity
the
brigands
crouched
before
her
talked
in
loud
tones
and
praised
her
beauty
in
terms
that
it
was
well
she
did
not
comprehend
the
corfuan
who
was
making
up
for
lost
time
held
out
to
her
a
cup
of
wine
which
she
proudly
repulsed
five
or
six
drinkers
more
inflamed
than
the
rest
began
to
fight
among
themselves
as
if
to
warm
themselves
up
and
toughen
themselves
for
later
and
harder
exploits
i
made
a
sign
to
simons
the
ladies
both
rose
but
the
moment
i
offered
my
arm
to
vasile
red
with
wine
advanced
with
a
staggering
gait
and
made
as
if
to
take
hold
of
her
at
this
sight
i
was
furious
i
jumped
at
the
miserable
cur
and
i
made
of
my
ten
fingers
a
cravat
for
him
he
clapped
his
hands
to
his
belt
and
gropingly
felt
for
the
handle
of
the
knife
but
before
he
could
find
it
i
saw
him
torn
from
my
hands
and
thrown
ten
feet
away
by
the
powerful
hand
of
the
old
king
a
murmur
arose
from
the
crowd
raised
his
head
and
in
a
tone
which
dominated
the
noise
cried
silence
show
that
you
are
greeks
and
not
albanians
he
added
in
a
low
tone
make
haste
the
corfuan
shall
not
leave
me
german
tell
the
ladies
that
i
will
sleep
at
the
door
of
their
tent
he
went
with
us
preceded
by
his
who
never
left
him
day
or
night
two
or
three
men
inflamed
with
wine
made
as
if
to
follow
us
he
repulsed
them
rudely
we
were
not
a
hundred
feet
from
the
crowd
when
a
ball
whizzed
by
us
the
old
palikar
did
not
deign
to
turn
his
head
he
looked
at
me
and
smiled
and
said
in
a
low
tone
one
must
be
indulgent
it
is
the
day
of
the
ascension
reaching
the
path
i
profited
by
the
stupidity
of
the
corfuan
who
was
tumbling
along
to
ask
simons
for
a
private
interview
i
have
i
said
to
her
an
important
secret
to
confide
to
you
permit
me
to
come
to
your
tent
when
our
spy
sleeps
the
sleep
of
noah
i
knew
not
whether
this
biblical
comparison
seemed
irreverent
but
she
dryly
replied
that
she
knew
enough
not
to
have
any
secrets
with
me
i
insisted
she
was
firm
i
told
her
i
had
found
a
means
of
freeing
ourselves
without
impoverishing
us
she
threw
me
a
glance
of
defiance
consulted
her
daughter
and
at
last
acquiesced
made
easy
our
interview
by
keeping
the
corfuan
near
him
he
had
his
carpet
spread
at
the
top
of
the
natural
staircase
which
led
to
our
camp
placed
his
arms
near
at
hand
made
the
lie
down
upon
his
right
and
the
corfuan
on
his
left
i
kept
prudently
within
my
tent
until
three
distinct
snores
assured
me
that
our
guardians
were
asleep
the
tumult
had
almost
subsided
two
or
three
shots
occasionally
disturbed
the
silence
of
the
night
our
neighbor
the
nightingale
poured
forth
his
song
i
carefully
crept
along
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
until
i
reached
simons
tent
mother
and
daughter
were
waiting
for
me
outside
on
the
damp
grass
english
custom
forbade
my
entrance
to
the
speak
monsieur
said
simons
but
be
quick
about
it
you
know
that
we
need
rest
i
replied
with
assurance
mesdames
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
is
well
worth
an
hour
of
sleep
would
you
like
to
be
free
in
three
days
but
monsieur
we
shall
be
or
england
will
not
be
england
dimitri
ought
to
have
apprised
my
brother
by
my
brother
would
see
our
minister
at
orders
ought
to
have
been
given
at
once
the
soldiers
are
already
on
the
way
and
we
shall
be
free
in
the
morning
in
time
for
breakfast
let
us
not
deceive
ourselves
time
passes
i
do
not
count
upon
the
gendarmes
our
captors
speak
too
lightly
of
them
to
fear
them
i
have
always
heard
that
in
this
country
hunter
and
game
gendarme
and
brigand
are
in
collusion
with
each
other
i
suppose
strictly
speaking
that
some
men
may
be
sent
to
our
aid
will
see
them
coming
and
will
drag
us
by
lonely
paths
to
another
and
more
remote
retreat
he
knows
the
country
thoroughly
all
the
rocks
are
his
accomplices
every
bush
his
ally
the
ravines
his
fence
receiver
of
stolen
goods
parnassus
is
leagued
with
him
against
us
he
is
the
king
of
the
mountains
bravo
monsieur
is
god
and
you
are
his
prophet
he
would
be
touched
to
hear
with
what
admiration
you
speak
of
him
i
have
already
divined
that
you
are
one
of
his
friends
seeing
how
he
put
his
hand
on
your
shoulder
as
if
he
was
speaking
to
you
in
confidence
is
it
not
he
who
has
suggested
the
plan
of
escape
which
you
have
come
to
propose
yes
madame
it
is
he
or
rather
his
correspondence
i
found
this
morning
while
he
was
dictating
to
his
secretaries
the
infallible
means
of
freeing
us
gratis
will
you
write
to
monsieur
your
brother
to
send
a
sum
of
francs
for
you
and
for
me
by
some
safe
person
say
dimitri
by
your
friend
dimitri
to
your
friend
the
king
of
the
mountains
many
thanks
my
dear
monsieur
it
is
for
this
price
that
we
are
to
be
freed
for
nothing
yes
madame
dimitri
is
not
my
friend
and
would
not
scruple
to
cut
off
my
head
but
i
will
continue
in
exchange
for
the
money
you
shall
insist
that
the
king
sign
a
receipt
and
a
fine
receipt
it
would
be
with
this
paper
you
would
get
back
your
francs
without
losing
a
centime
and
you
will
see
how
good
evening
monsieur
do
not
waste
time
to
say
any
more
since
we
landed
in
this
miserable
country
we
have
been
robbed
by
everybody
the
robbed
us
the
man
who
drove
us
to
athens
robbed
us
our
has
robbed
us
our
servant
hired
by
the
day
who
is
not
your
friend
has
thrown
us
into
the
hands
of
these
thieves
we
met
a
respectable
monk
who
shared
the
spoils
with
the
brigands
all
the
men
who
were
drinking
up
there
are
knaves
those
who
sleep
before
our
tent
to
protect
us
are
of
the
same
class
you
are
the
only
honest
man
whom
we
have
met
in
greece
and
your
counsels
are
the
best
in
the
world
but
monsieur
in
the
name
of
heaven
madame
i
will
not
attempt
to
justify
myself
think
what
you
will
of
me
only
permit
me
to
tell
you
how
you
can
get
back
your
money
and
how
do
you
think
i
can
get
it
back
if
all
the
soldiers
of
the
kingdom
can
not
free
us
is
then
no
longer
king
of
the
mountains
he
knows
no
more
hidden
paths
the
ravines
the
bushes
the
rocks
are
no
longer
his
accomplices
monsieur
i
can
testify
to
your
zeal
i
will
tell
the
brigands
that
you
have
executed
their
commission
but
once
for
all
monsieur
the
good
woman
gave
me
a
push
by
the
shoulders
crying
in
so
shrill
a
tone
that
i
trembled
lest
she
should
awaken
our
guardians
and
i
sorrowfully
went
to
my
tent
what
a
day
i
went
over
one
by
one
all
the
incidents
which
had
occurred
since
the
hour
i
left
in
pursuit
of
the
boryana
variabilis
the
meeting
with
the
englishwomen
beautiful
eyes
the
attack
of
the
brigands
the
dogs
the
fleas
fifteen
thousand
francs
to
pay
my
life
at
that
price
the
orgies
of
the
ascension
the
balls
whizzing
about
my
ears
the
drunken
face
of
vasile
and
to
crown
all
simons
injustice
and
then
to
be
taken
for
a
thief
sleep
which
consoled
the
others
did
not
come
to
my
aid
all
the
events
which
had
happened
had
me
and
i
could
not
sleep
day
broke
upon
my
miserable
meditations
i
followed
the
course
of
the
sun
as
it
rose
in
the
heavens
some
confused
noises
followed
little
by
little
the
silence
of
the
night
i
had
not
courage
to
look
at
my
watch
or
to
turn
my
head
to
see
what
was
passing
around
me
i
was
overcome
with
fatigue
and
discouragement
i
believe
if
anyone
had
attempted
to
roll
me
down
the
hill
that
i
would
not
have
put
out
my
hands
to
stop
myself
in
this
prostration
of
my
faculties
i
had
a
vision
which
partook
at
the
same
time
of
a
dream
and
an
hallucination
because
i
was
neither
awake
nor
asleep
and
my
eyes
were
neither
closed
nor
open
it
seemed
that
i
had
been
buried
alive
that
my
felt
tent
was
a
catafalque
adorned
with
flowers
and
that
some
one
chanted
prayers
for
the
dead
fears
seized
me
i
tried
to
cry
out
the
words
stuck
in
my
throat
or
the
sound
of
them
was
drowned
in
the
chants
i
heard
distinctly
verses
and
responses
and
i
recognized
that
funeral
services
were
being
celebrated
over
me
in
greek
i
made
a
violent
effort
to
move
my
right
arm
it
was
like
lead
i
extended
my
left
it
yielded
easily
striking
against
the
tent
and
causing
something
like
a
bouquet
to
fall
i
rubbed
my
eyes
i
rose
on
my
elbow
i
examined
the
flowers
fallen
from
above
and
i
recognized
in
the
superb
specimen
the
boryana
variabilis
it
was
certainly
the
flower
i
touched
the
lobated
leaves
its
gamosepalous
calyx
its
corolla
composed
of
five
oblique
petals
united
at
the
base
by
a
staminal
filament
its
ten
stamens
its
ovary
with
its
five
loculaments
i
held
in
my
hand
the
queen
of
malvaceae
but
by
what
chance
had
i
found
it
at
the
bottom
of
my
tomb
and
how
send
it
so
far
to
the
jardin
des
plantes
at
hamburg
at
this
moment
a
lively
pain
drew
my
attention
to
my
right
arm
one
would
have
said
that
it
was
the
prey
of
a
swarm
of
invisible
little
animals
i
rubbed
it
with
my
left
hand
and
little
by
little
it
became
normal
i
had
lain
with
it
under
my
head
for
many
hours
and
it
had
become
numb
i
lived
then
since
pain
is
one
of
the
privileges
of
life
but
then
what
did
that
funeral
chant
which
rang
obstinately
in
my
ears
mean
i
raised
myself
our
apartment
was
in
the
same
state
as
on
the
evening
before
simons
and
her
daughter
were
sleeping
profoundly
a
huge
bunch
of
flowers
like
mine
hung
from
the
upper
part
of
their
tent
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
heard
that
the
greeks
had
a
custom
of
decorating
their
dwellings
on
the
night
before
the
first
of
may
these
bouquets
and
the
boryana
variabilis
came
then
from
the
munificence
of
the
king
the
funeral
chant
haunted
me
i
could
still
hear
it
i
climbed
the
staircase
which
led
to
the
king
cabinet
and
saw
a
more
curious
spectacle
than
any
that
had
astonished
me
the
evening
before
an
altar
was
set
up
and
dressed
under
the
pine
the
monk
clothed
in
magnificent
pontificals
was
celebrating
with
imposing
dignity
the
divine
office
our
drinkers
of
the
night
before
some
standing
others
kneeling
in
the
dust
all
religiously
uncovered
were
metamorphosed
into
little
saints
one
fervently
kissed
an
image
painted
on
wood
another
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
the
most
fervent
bowed
themselves
to
the
ground
and
wiped
the
dust
with
their
hair
the
king
young
circulated
through
the
crowd
with
a
plate
saying
give
alms
he
who
giveth
to
the
church
lendeth
to
the
lord
and
the
centimes
showered
upon
the
plate
and
the
ring
of
the
coins
as
they
fell
upon
the
copper
dish
made
an
accompaniment
to
the
voice
of
the
priest
and
the
prayers
of
the
suppliants
when
i
entered
the
assembly
of
the
faithful
each
one
saluted
me
with
a
discreet
cordiality
which
recalled
the
primitive
church
near
the
altar
made
place
for
me
at
his
side
he
held
a
large
book
in
his
hand
and
judge
of
my
surprise
when
i
heard
him
recite
the
lessons
in
a
loud
voice
a
brigand
officiating
he
had
received
in
his
youth
two
of
the
lower
orders
he
was
reader
one
degree
more
he
would
have
been
exorcist
and
invested
with
the
power
of
chasing
out
devils
assuredly
i
am
not
one
of
those
travelers
who
are
astonished
at
everything
and
i
practice
energetically
enough
the
nil
admirari
but
i
was
and
amazed
before
this
strange
spectacle
looking
on
at
the
genuflections
listening
to
the
prayers
one
would
have
supposed
these
actors
guilty
only
of
a
little
idolatry
their
faith
seemed
active
and
their
conviction
profound
but
i
who
had
seen
them
at
work
and
who
knew
how
little
they
were
in
action
i
could
not
help
saying
to
myself
who
is
being
fooled
the
office
lasted
until
some
minutes
after
noon
an
hour
afterward
the
altar
had
disappeared
the
men
had
begun
to
drink
again
and
the
good
old
man
the
monk
led
them
the
king
took
me
one
side
and
asked
me
if
i
had
written
i
promised
to
do
so
at
once
and
he
gave
me
reeds
ink
and
paper
i
wrote
to
john
harris
to
christodule
and
to
my
father
i
supplicated
christodule
to
intercede
for
me
with
his
old
comrade
and
i
told
him
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
furnish
fifteen
thousand
francs
i
recommended
myself
to
the
courage
and
imagination
of
john
harris
who
was
not
a
man
to
leave
a
friend
in
trouble
if
any
one
can
save
me
i
wrote
to
him
it
is
you
i
do
not
know
how
you
can
do
it
but
i
hope
in
you
with
all
my
soul
you
are
such
a
fellow
i
do
not
count
on
your
finding
fifteen
thousand
francs
ransom
it
would
be
necessary
to
borrow
them
of
mérinay
who
lends
nothing
you
are
moreover
too
american
to
consent
to
such
a
bargain
do
as
you
please
set
fire
to
the
kingdom
i
approve
of
everything
in
advance
but
lose
no
time
i
believe
that
my
head
is
weak
and
that
my
reason
will
be
gone
before
the
end
of
the
month
as
for
my
unfortunate
father
i
kept
from
him
the
facts
to
what
good
to
bring
death
to
his
soul
by
telling
him
to
what
dangers
i
was
exposed
i
wrote
to
him
as
always
the
first
of
the
month
that
i
was
well
and
i
hoped
my
letter
would
find
the
family
well
i
added
that
i
was
sojourning
in
the
mountains
that
i
had
discovered
the
boryana
variabilis
and
a
young
englishwoman
more
beautiful
and
richer
than
the
princess
ypsoff
of
romantic
memory
i
had
not
yet
been
able
to
inspire
her
with
love
for
the
lack
of
favorable
circumstances
but
i
would
find
perhaps
some
occasion
when
i
could
render
her
some
great
service
or
show
myself
to
her
in
my
uncle
rosenthaler
uniform
but
i
added
with
a
feeling
of
unconquerable
sadness
who
knows
but
that
i
may
die
a
bachelor
then
it
would
fall
to
frantz
or
to
make
a
fortune
for
the
family
my
health
is
better
than
ever
and
my
strength
is
not
yet
weakened
but
greece
is
a
traitor
which
makes
short
work
of
the
most
vigorous
men
if
i
am
condemned
to
never
see
germany
again
and
to
die
here
some
unexpected
death
at
the
end
of
my
travels
and
my
work
my
last
regret
would
be
for
my
family
and
my
last
thought
of
them
the
king
came
up
just
as
i
was
wiping
away
a
tear
and
i
believe
that
this
mark
of
weakness
made
him
lose
some
of
his
esteem
for
me
come
young
man
have
courage
the
time
is
not
yet
come
to
weep
over
yourself
what
the
devil
one
would
say
that
you
had
been
assisting
at
your
own
interment
the
english
lady
has
written
a
letter
of
eight
pages
and
she
has
not
dropped
a
tear
go
and
keep
her
company
for
a
little
while
she
needs
entertainment
ah
if
you
were
a
man
of
my
temper
i
swear
to
you
that
at
your
age
and
in
your
position
i
would
not
remain
long
a
prisoner
my
ransom
would
be
paid
in
two
days
and
i
know
full
well
who
would
furnish
the
funds
you
are
not
married
no
oh
well
you
do
not
understand
return
to
your
camping
place
and
make
yourself
agreeable
i
have
furnished
you
a
fine
opportunity
to
get
a
fortune
if
you
do
not
profit
by
it
you
will
be
foolish
and
if
you
do
not
put
me
on
the
list
of
your
benefactors
you
will
be
an
ingrate
i
found
and
her
mother
seated
near
the
cascade
while
waiting
for
their
which
had
been
promised
them
they
were
themselves
endeavoring
to
mend
their
torn
habits
the
bandits
had
furnished
them
with
thread
or
rather
with
twine
and
some
needles
suitable
for
sewing
sails
from
time
to
time
they
stopped
their
work
to
look
with
melancholy
gaze
upon
the
houses
in
athens
it
was
hard
to
see
the
city
so
near
and
not
to
be
able
to
go
there
except
at
a
cost
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
i
asked
them
how
they
had
slept
the
curtness
of
their
reply
proved
to
me
that
they
had
been
discussing
our
interview
at
this
moment
i
noticed
hair
she
was
and
after
washing
it
at
the
brook
she
had
left
it
to
dry
in
the
sun
i
would
never
have
believed
that
any
woman
could
possess
such
a
profusion
of
soft
glossy
chestnut
hair
it
fell
in
masses
over
her
shoulders
and
down
her
back
but
it
did
not
hang
in
limp
strings
like
the
locks
of
other
women
who
have
just
washed
them
it
fell
in
perfect
waves
like
the
surface
of
a
little
lake
rippled
by
the
wind
i
had
never
loved
anyone
and
i
ought
not
to
have
begun
by
falling
in
love
with
a
girl
who
took
me
for
a
thief
but
i
confess
that
i
wished
at
the
price
of
my
life
to
save
those
beautiful
tresses
from
the
clutches
of
i
conceived
while
sitting
there
a
plan
of
escape
difficult
but
not
impossible
our
apartment
had
two
exits
one
upon
the
king
cabinet
or
office
the
other
over
the
precipice
to
escape
by
the
king
cabinet
was
absurd
it
would
be
necessary
to
traverse
the
camp
and
pass
the
second
line
of
defense
guarded
by
the
dogs
there
remained
the
precipice
in
looking
over
into
the
abyss
i
saw
that
the
rock
almost
perpendicular
offered
enough
sinuous
depression
with
tufts
of
grass
with
little
saplings
and
available
shrubs
of
all
kinds
to
permit
one
to
descend
without
breaking
neck
what
would
render
flight
dangerous
on
this
side
was
the
cascade
the
brook
which
flowed
through
the
place
formed
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
a
horribly
glistening
sheet
it
would
moreover
be
difficult
to
keep
one
courage
while
descending
the
side
of
the
mountain
safely
with
a
torrent
of
water
pouring
over
one
head
but
were
there
no
means
of
turning
the
course
of
the
stream
perhaps
in
examining
more
closely
the
place
where
we
had
slept
i
saw
that
without
any
doubt
the
water
had
once
traversed
that
spot
our
camping
place
was
then
only
the
dry
bed
of
a
torrent
i
raised
a
corner
of
the
carpet
which
was
spread
under
our
feet
and
i
discovered
a
thick
sediment
left
by
the
water
it
was
possible
that
some
day
or
other
an
earthquake
so
frequent
in
those
mountains
had
broken
down
an
embankment
or
a
vein
of
rock
softer
than
the
others
had
given
passage
to
the
current
and
the
mass
of
waters
had
been
thrown
from
its
bed
a
strip
ten
feet
long
and
three
wide
led
to
the
side
of
the
mountain
in
order
to
close
this
sluice
open
for
many
years
and
imprison
the
waters
in
their
first
reservoir
only
two
hours
work
was
needed
an
hour
more
would
be
enough
to
drain
off
the
water
and
the
night
wind
would
soon
dry
the
rocks
our
escape
the
way
thus
prepared
would
not
take
more
than
minutes
once
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
we
would
have
athens
before
us
and
the
stars
would
serve
as
guides
the
paths
were
detestable
but
we
would
run
no
risk
of
meeting
a
brigand
when
the
king
would
come
in
the
morning
to
make
us
a
visit
to
inquire
how
we
had
passed
the
night
he
would
see
that
we
had
passed
it
running
and
as
one
can
acquire
knowledge
at
any
age
he
would
learn
to
his
sorrow
that
one
can
not
count
on
one
self
and
that
a
cascade
was
a
bad
guard
for
prisoners
this
project
seemed
to
me
so
marvelous
that
i
at
once
imparted
it
to
the
ladies
they
listened
at
first
as
prudent
conspirators
listen
to
an
irritating
agent
the
younger
woman
however
measured
without
a
tremor
the
depth
of
the
ravine
one
could
do
it
she
said
not
alone
but
with
the
help
of
a
strong
arm
are
you
strong
monsieur
i
replied
without
knowing
why
i
shall
be
if
you
will
have
confidence
in
me
these
words
to
which
i
attached
no
particular
meaning
seemed
without
doubt
somewhat
foolish
for
she
blushed
and
turned
away
her
head
monsieur
she
replied
it
may
be
that
we
have
judged
you
wrongly
misfortune
embitters
one
i
would
willingly
believe
that
you
are
a
worthy
young
man
she
might
have
been
able
to
find
something
more
agreeable
to
say
but
she
gave
me
this
half
compliment
in
a
voice
so
sweet
and
a
look
so
sincere
that
i
was
moved
to
the
depths
of
my
soul
so
true
is
it
that
if
the
air
is
pretty
the
words
of
a
song
do
not
matter
she
held
out
to
me
her
beautiful
hand
and
i
had
already
put
my
own
out
to
take
it
when
she
suddenly
withdrew
it
and
said
where
will
you
get
the
material
for
a
dike
under
our
feet
the
turf
the
water
will
wash
it
away
not
under
two
hours
after
us
the
deluge
good
this
time
she
gave
me
her
hand
and
i
was
about
to
carry
it
to
my
lips
but
she
quickly
withdrew
it
again
we
are
guarded
night
and
day
have
you
thought
of
that
i
had
not
even
thought
of
it
but
i
was
too
well
on
my
way
to
recoil
before
any
obstacle
i
replied
with
a
resolution
which
astonished
me
the
corfuan
i
will
see
to
him
i
will
tie
him
to
a
tree
he
will
cry
out
i
will
kill
him
and
the
arms
to
do
it
with
i
will
steal
them
to
steal
to
kill
it
seemed
natural
since
i
had
almost
kissed
her
hand
judge
then
monsieur
of
what
i
might
be
capable
if
ever
i
fell
in
love
simons
listened
with
a
certain
kindness
and
i
believe
approved
of
my
plan
by
look
and
gesture
my
dear
monsieur
she
said
to
me
your
second
plan
is
better
than
your
first
yes
infinitely
better
i
would
never
consent
to
pay
a
ransom
even
with
the
certainty
of
receiving
it
again
immediately
tell
me
again
then
if
you
please
what
you
intend
to
do
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
plan
madame
i
will
procure
a
poniard
our
brigands
will
go
to
sleep
early
and
they
will
sleep
soundly
i
will
rise
at
ten
i
will
bind
our
guard
i
will
gag
him
and
if
necessary
i
will
kill
him
it
would
not
be
murder
it
would
be
an
execution
he
merits
twenty
deaths
instead
of
one
at
ten
and
a
half
i
will
take
up
fifty
square
feet
of
turf
you
can
carry
it
to
the
edge
of
the
brook
and
i
will
construct
the
dam
total
one
hour
and
a
half
it
will
take
till
midnight
we
will
labor
together
to
hasten
the
work
while
the
wind
will
dry
off
our
path
one
will
come
i
will
take
mademoiselle
on
my
left
arm
we
will
glide
carefully
to
that
crevasse
we
will
hold
ourselves
up
by
those
bushes
we
will
reach
the
wild
we
will
stop
to
rest
at
that
green
oak
we
will
creep
along
to
that
prominence
near
those
red
rocks
we
will
get
down
to
the
ravine
and
we
shall
be
free
good
and
i
that
i
fell
upon
my
enthusiasm
like
a
douche
of
water
one
is
not
wise
in
all
things
and
i
had
forgotten
all
about
saving
simons
returning
to
help
her
down
was
not
to
be
thought
of
the
ascent
would
be
impossible
without
a
ladder
the
good
woman
noticed
my
confusion
she
said
to
me
with
more
pity
than
spite
my
poor
man
you
see
that
romantic
projects
always
fail
at
some
point
permit
me
to
hold
to
my
first
idea
of
waiting
for
the
gendarmerie
i
am
english
and
i
have
a
confirmed
habit
of
placing
my
confidence
in
the
law
i
know
moreover
the
soldiers
of
athens
i
have
seen
them
parade
in
the
palace
square
they
are
handsome
fellows
and
quite
soldiers
for
greeks
they
have
long
mustaches
and
it
is
they
pardon
me
who
will
liberate
us
the
corfuan
appearance
prevented
my
reply
he
brought
a
maid
for
the
ladies
she
was
an
albanian
quite
handsome
in
spite
of
her
snub
nose
two
brigands
who
were
returning
to
the
mountains
had
forcibly
taken
her
as
she
was
walking
between
her
mother
and
her
betrothed
all
dressed
in
their
sunday
clothes
she
screamed
with
such
agonizing
cries
that
it
would
have
pierced
a
heart
of
marble
but
they
consoled
her
by
telling
her
that
they
would
not
only
release
her
in
fifteen
days
but
that
they
would
also
pay
her
she
accepted
her
lot
bravely
and
almost
rejoiced
at
the
misfortune
which
would
increase
her
dowry
happy
country
where
the
wounds
of
the
heart
are
cured
with
five
franc
pieces
this
philosophical
servant
was
not
of
very
great
use
to
simons
of
all
the
different
avenues
of
work
open
to
her
sex
she
knew
only
farming
as
for
me
she
made
life
unbearable
by
the
habit
she
had
of
nibbling
at
a
clove
of
garlic
as
a
dainty
bit
and
through
coquetry
as
the
ladies
of
hamburg
amuse
themselves
devouring
bonbons
the
day
passed
without
incident
the
next
day
seemed
to
all
of
us
interminably
long
the
corfuan
left
us
not
an
instant
alone
and
her
mother
searched
the
horizon
for
the
soldiers
but
saw
nothing
i
who
am
accustomed
to
active
life
fretted
at
the
inactivity
i
could
have
had
the
range
of
mountains
to
add
to
my
herbarium
under
guard
but
a
certain
feeling
i
knew
not
what
held
me
near
the
ladies
during
the
night
i
slept
little
my
plan
of
escape
obstinately
haunted
me
i
had
noticed
the
place
where
the
corfuan
laid
his
dagger
before
going
to
sleep
but
i
would
have
considered
it
treachery
to
have
saved
myself
without
saturday
morning
between
five
and
six
an
unusual
noise
drew
me
towards
the
king
cabinet
my
toilet
was
quickly
made
i
went
to
bed
fully
dressed
standing
in
the
midst
of
his
band
was
presiding
at
a
noisy
council
all
the
brigands
were
upon
the
war
path
armed
to
the
teeth
ten
or
a
dozen
coffers
which
i
had
not
seen
before
had
been
piled
on
some
i
divined
that
they
contained
the
baggage
and
that
our
captors
were
preparing
to
leave
camp
the
corfuan
vasile
and
sophocles
were
contesting
something
at
the
top
of
their
voices
and
all
talking
together
one
could
hear
from
a
distance
the
barking
of
the
outside
guards
a
courier
in
tatters
ran
toward
the
king
crying
the
gendarmes
the
gendarmes
the
king
appeared
to
be
little
troubled
his
eyebrows
were
however
drawn
a
little
nearer
together
than
was
usual
and
the
wrinkles
on
his
forehead
formed
an
acute
angle
between
his
eyes
he
asked
the
courier
where
are
they
near
castia
how
many
companies
one
whose
i
do
not
know
wait
a
second
messenger
was
seen
running
toward
the
king
cried
out
to
him
is
it
pericles
company
i
do
not
know
i
did
not
see
their
number
a
shot
was
heard
at
a
distance
listen
commanded
the
king
taking
out
his
watch
the
men
were
silent
four
shots
followed
a
minute
apart
the
last
one
was
followed
by
a
thundering
detonation
which
resembled
the
king
with
a
smile
put
his
watch
back
in
his
pocket
it
is
all
right
return
the
baggage
to
the
storeroom
and
serve
me
with
wine
of
aegina
it
is
pericles
company
he
saw
me
just
as
he
finished
the
sentence
he
called
to
me
in
a
jeering
tone
come
monsieur
german
you
are
not
it
is
well
to
rise
early
one
sees
curious
things
your
thirst
has
awakened
you
will
you
drink
a
glass
of
wine
of
aegina
with
our
brave
gendarmes
five
minutes
later
three
enormous
bottles
were
brought
from
some
secret
hiding
place
a
sentinel
approached
the
king
good
news
they
are
pericles
men
a
few
of
the
bandits
were
in
advance
of
the
troops
the
corfuan
a
fine
talker
skipped
along
by
the
captain
side
his
tongue
running
a
drum
was
heard
then
a
blue
flag
was
seen
and
sixty
men
fully
armed
marched
in
double
file
to
the
king
cabinet
i
recognized
pericles
because
i
had
admired
him
on
the
promenade
at
athens
he
was
a
young
officer
of
dark
a
coxcomb
admired
by
the
ladies
the
best
waltzer
at
court
and
wearing
his
epaulets
with
grace
he
put
up
his
sword
ran
to
the
king
of
the
mountains
who
kissed
him
on
the
mouth
saying
good
morning
godfather
good
morning
little
one
the
king
replied
caressing
his
cheek
with
his
hand

the
most
rigid
orders
thy
english
prisoners
have
written
to
their
ambassador
they
have
called
the
entire
army
to
their
aid
and
it
is
i
who

the
paper

some
other
time
what
an
insatiable
it
is
only
a
year
since
i
made
thee
captain
but
understand
dear
godfather
that
it
is
for
thy
interest
to
be
conquered
when
the
world
shall
learn
that
thy
band
is
dispersed
confidence
will
be
restored
travelers
will
again
pour
into
the
country
and
thou
wilt
make
thy
fortune
yes
but
if
i
am
conquered
the
bourse
will
send
up
stocks
and
i
am
speculating
on
a
fall
that
is
another
affair
at
least
let
me
kill
a
dozen
men
so
be
it
that
will
harm
no
one
on
my
side
i
must
kill
ten
how
one
will
see
on
our
return
that
our
company
is
full
not
so
thou
shalt
leave
them
here
i
need
recruits
in
that
case
i
recommend
to
thee
little
spiro
my
adjutant
he
is
a
graduate
of
the
military
school
he
has
been
well
instructed
and
is
intelligent
the
poor
boy
gets
only
francs
a
month
and
his
parents
are
not
very
well
satisfied
if
he
remains
in
the
army
he
will
not
become
a
under
five
or
six
years
the
staffs
are
complete
but
let
him
make
himself
remarked
in
thy
troop
they
will
offer
to
bribe
him
and
he
would
have
his
nomination
in
six
months
good
for
the
little
spiro
does
he
speak
french
passably
i
will
keep
him
perhaps
if
he
does
well
for
me
i
will
include
him
in
the
enterprise
he
might
be
a
stockholder
thou
wilt
receive
our
account
rendered
for
the
year
i
give
per
cent
bravo
my
eight
shares
will
bring
me
more
than
my
captain
pay
ah
godfather
what
career
is
mine
what
dost
thou
risk
thou
couldst
be
a
brigand
but
for
thy
notions
she
has
always
pretended
that
thou
hast
lacked
a
vocation
to
thy
health
and
to
yours
german
i
present
to
you
my
godson
captain
pericles
a
charming
young
man
who
knows
many
languages
and
who
will
replace
me
during
my
absence
my
dear
pericles
i
present
to
thee
monsieur
who
is
a
doctor
and
is
valued
at
fifteen
thousand
francs
canst
thou
believe
that
this
tall
doctor
all
doctor
as
he
is
has
not
yet
found
out
how
to
pay
his
ransom
through
our
english
captives
the
world
has
degenerated
little
one
it
was
better
in
my
day
thereupon
he
nimbly
rose
and
hastened
to
give
some
orders
for
departure
was
it
the
pleasure
of
entering
on
a
campaign
or
the
joy
of
seeing
his
godson
he
seemed
rejuvenated
he
was
twenty
years
younger
he
laughed
he
jested
he
shook
off
his
royal
dignity
i
would
never
have
supposed
that
the
only
event
capable
of
cheering
a
brigand
would
be
the
arrival
of
the
gendarmerie
sophocles
vasile
the
corfuan
and
the
other
chiefs
carried
the
king
orders
through
the
camp
every
one
was
soon
ready
to
depart
owing
to
the
morning
activity
the
young
adjutant
spiro
and
the
nine
men
chosen
from
among
the
gendarmes
exchanged
their
uniforms
for
the
picturesque
dress
of
the
bandits
this
was
a
veritable
the
minister
of
war
if
he
had
been
there
would
have
almost
been
unable
to
have
told
how
it
was
done
the
brigands
seemed
to
feel
no
regret
for
their
former
employment
the
only
ones
who
murmured
were
those
who
remained
under
the
old
flag
two
or
three
veterans
loudly
complained
that
the
selection
had
not
been
well
made
and
that
no
account
had
been
taken
of
seniority
a
few
old
soldiers
vaunted
their
exploits
and
laid
claim
to
having
served
the
required
time
in
brigandage
the
captain
soothed
them
as
best
he
could
and
promised
them
that
their
turn
should
come
before
departing
gave
all
his
keys
to
his
representative
he
showed
him
the
grotto
where
the
wine
was
kept
in
the
cave
in
which
was
the
flour
the
cheese
packed
in
a
crevice
and
the
trunk
of
a
tree
in
which
was
kept
the
coffee
he
instructed
him
in
every
precaution
which
was
to
be
taken
to
prevent
our
escape
and
to
keep
possession
of
so
splendid
a
sum
the
handsome
pericles
smilingly
replied
what
dost
thou
fear
i
am
a
stockholder
at
seven
in
the
morning
the
king
put
himself
at
the
head
of
his
band
and
the
men
marched
forth
in
single
file
they
marched
toward
the
north
keeping
their
backs
to
the
sciromian
rocks
they
made
a
long
detour
by
a
path
which
was
easy
to
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
which
was
below
our
camping
place
the
bandits
sang
at
the
top
of
their
voices
while
wading
through
the
brook
formed
by
the
waters
of
the
cascade
as
they
fell
into
the
ravine
the
was
a
story
of
youth
consisting
of
four
verses
the
clephte
aux

you
ought
to
know
it
the
little
athenian
lads
sing
nothing
else
on
the
way
to
catechism
simons
who
slept
near
her
daughter
and
who
was
always
dreaming
of
the
gendarmes
jumped
up
and
ran
to
the
window
that
is
to
say
the
cascade
she
was
cruelly
disappointed
in
seeing
enemies
when
she
expected
to
find
saviors
she
recognized
the
king
the
corfuan
and
several
others
what
was
the
most
astonishing
thing
to
her
was
the
formidable
appearance
and
numbers
of
this
morning
expedition
she
counted
sixty
men
following
sixty
she
thought
there
only
remains
twenty
then
to
guard
us
the
idea
of
escape
which
she
had
scorned
the
night
before
now
presented
itself
to
her
with
some
favor
in
the
midst
of
these
reflections
she
saw
the
appear
and
which
she
had
not
counted
sixteen
seventeen
eighteen
nineteen
twenty
men
then
there
was
no
one
left
in
the
camp
we
are
free
she
cried
the
men
still
filed
past
the
band
itself
consisted
of
eighty
men
ninety
marched
by
a
dozen
dogs
came
behind
but
she
took
no
trouble
to
count
them
arose
at
her
mother
call
and
came
quickly
from
the
tent
free
cried
simons
they
have
all
left
what
did
i
say
all
even
a
larger
number
has
gone
than
was
here
let
us
hasten
away
my
daughter
she
hurried
to
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
saw
the
king
camp
occupied
by
the
soldiers
the
greek
flag
floated
triumphantly
at
the
summit
of
the
pine
tree
place
was
occupied
by
pericles
simons
threw
herself
into
his
arms
in
such
a
transport
that
he
had
hard
work
to
free
himself
from
her
embrace
angel
of
god
she
said
to
him
the
brigands
have
gone
the
captain
replied
in
english
yes
madame
you
have
put
them
to
flight
it
is
true
madame
that
but
for
us
they
would
still
be
here
excellent
young
man
the
battle
must
have
been
terrible
not
so
a
battle
without
tears
i
had
only
to
say
a
word
and
we
are
free
assuredly
we
may
return
to
athens
when
it
pleases
you
oh
well
let
us
depart
at
once
impossible
for
the
moment
what
would
we
do
here
our
duty
to
our
conquerors
we
will
guard
the
battle
ground
give
thy
hand
to
monsieur
the
young
english
girl
obeyed
monsieur
said
simons
it
is
god
who
sends
you
here
we
had
lost
all
hope
our
only
protector
was
a
young
german
of
the
middle
class
a
savant
who
gathers
herbs
and
who
wished
to
save
us
by
the
most
preposterous
means
at
last
you
have
come
i
was
sure
that
we
would
be
delivered
by
the
gendarmerie
is
it
not
so
yes
mamma
know
monsieur
that
these
bandits
are
the
vilest
of
men
they
began
by
taking
everything
from
us
all
asked
the
captain
all
except
my
watch
which
i
took
the
precaution
to
hide
you
did
well
madame
and
they
kept
all
that
they
took
from
you
no
they
returned
three
hundred
francs
a
silver
traveling
case
and
my
daughter
watch
these
things
are
still
in
your
possession
certainly
they
did
not
take
from
you
your
rings
and
your
no
monsieur
le
capitaine
will
you
be
good
enough
to
give
them
to
me
give
you
what
your
rings
your
the
silver
traveling
case
two
watches
and
the
sum
of
three
hundred
francs
simons
cried
out
what
monsieur
you
would
take
from
us
the
articles
the
bandits
returned
to
us
the
captain
replied
with
dignity
madame
i
must
do
my
duty
your
duty
is
to
despoil
us
my
duty
is
to
collect
all
the
articles
for
necessary
conviction
in
the
trial
of
he
will
then
be
tried
since
we
have
taken
him
it
seems
to
me
that
our
jewels
and
our
money
would
serve
nothing
and
that
you
have
sufficient
testimony
to
hang
him
first
of
all
he
captured
two
englishwomen
what
more
is
necessary
it
is
necessary
madame
that
the
forms
of
justice
be
observed
but
dear
sir
among
the
articles
which
you
demand
there
are
some
which
i
prize
highly
the
more
reason
madame
to
confide
them
to
my
care
but
if
i
had
no
watch
i
should
never
madame
it
will
always
give
me
pleasure
to
tell
you
the
hour
observed
in
her
turn
that
it
was
disagreeable
to
her
to
be
obliged
to
give
up
her
mademoiselle
the
gallant
captain
replied
you
are
beautiful
enough
not
to
need
jewels
you
can
do
better
without
gems
than
your
gems
can
do
without
you
you
are
very
good
monsieur
but
my
silver
dressing
case
or
necessaire
is
an
indispensable
article
what
one
calls
a
necessaire
is
a
thing
with
which
one
can
not
dispense
you
are
a
thousand
times
right
mademoiselle
so
i
beg
of
you
not
to
insist
upon
that
point
do
not
add
to
the
regret
with
which
i
have
already
legally
despoiled
two
so
distinguished
persons
alas
mademoiselle
we
military
men
we
are
the
slaves
of
orders
instruments
of
the
law
men
of
duty
deign
to
accept
my
arm
i
will
do
myself
the
honor
of
conducting
you
to
your
tent
there
we
will
proceed
to
the
inventory
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
permit
it
i
lost
not
one
word
of
this
conversation
and
i
kept
silent
to
the
end
but
when
i
saw
this
rascal
of
an
officer
offer
his
arm
to
in
order
to
politely
plunder
her
i
became
enraged
and
i
marched
up
to
him
to
tell
him
what
i
thought
of
him
he
must
have
read
in
my
eyes
the
exordium
of
my
discourse
because
he
threw
a
menacing
look
at
me
left
the
ladies
at
the
staircase
of
their
chamber
placed
a
sentinel
there
and
returned
to
me
saying
between
us
two
he
drew
me
without
adding
a
word
to
the
rear
of
the
king
cabinet
there
he
seated
himself
before
me
looked
me
straight
in
the
eyes
and
said
monsieur
you
understand
english
i
confessed
my
knowledge
he
added
you
know
greek
also
yes
monsieur
then
you
are
too
learned
do
you
understand
my
godfather
who
amuses
himself
recounting
our
affairs
before
you
that
is
of
no
importance
to
him
he
has
nothing
to
hide
he
is
king
he
is
responsible
to
no
one
but
himself
as
for
me
what
the
devil
put
yourself
in
my
place
my
position
is
delicate
and
i
have
many
affairs
to
manage
i
am
not
rich
i
have
only
my
pay
the
esteem
of
my
chiefs
and
the
friendship
of
the
brigands
a
traveler
indiscretion
might
cost
me
my
promotions
and
you
count
on
the
fact
that
i
will
keep
your
infamies
secret
when
i
count
on
anything
monsieur
my
confidence
is
rarely
misplaced
i
do
not
know
that
you
will
leave
these
mountains
alive
and
yet
your
ransom
may
never
be
paid
if
my
godfather
would
cut
off
your
head
i
should
be
satisfied
you
would
not
talk
if
on
the
contrary
you
should
return
to
athens
i
counsel
you
as
a
friend
to
keep
silent
about
what
you
have
seen
imitate
the
discretion
of
the
late
madame
la
duchesse
de
plaisance
who
was
taken
captive
by
bibichi
and
who
died
ten
years
later
without
having
related
to
any
one
the
details
of
her
captivity
do
you
know
a
proverb
which
runs
the
tongue
cuts
off
the
head
meditate
seriously
upon
it
and
do
not
put
yourself
in
a
place
to
exactly
verify
it
the
menace
i
do
not
menace
you
monsieur
i
am
a
man
too
well
brought
up
to
resort
to
threats
i
warn
you
if
you
should
gossip
it
is
not
i
who
would
avenge
myself
all
the
men
in
my
company
adore
their
captain
they
are
even
more
warmly
interested
in
my
interests
than
i
am
myself
they
would
be
pitiless
to
my
great
regret
to
any
indiscreet
person
who
had
caused
me
any
trouble
what
do
you
fear
if
you
have
so
many
accomplices
i
fear
nothing
from
the
greeks
and
in
ordinary
times
i
should
insist
less
strongly
on
my
orders
we
have
among
our
chiefs
some
fanatics
who
think
that
we
ought
to
treat
bandits
like
turks
but
i
have
also
found
some
who
are
on
the
right
side
in
case
it
came
to
an
internecine
struggle
the
misfortune
is
that
the
diplomats
would
interfere
and
the
presence
of
a
stranger
would
without
doubt
injure
my
cause
if
any
misfortune
happens
to
me
through
you
do
you
see
monsieur
to
what
you
would
be
exposed
one
can
not
take
four
steps
in
the
kingdom
without
meeting
a
gendarme
the
road
from
athens
to
piraeus
is
under
the
vigilance
of
these
quarrelsome
persons
and
accidents
frequently
occur
it
is
well
monsieur
i
will
reflect
upon
it
and
will
keep
the
secret
you
have
nothing
to
ask
of
me
and
i
have
nothing
to
promise
you
have
advised
me
of
the
danger
of
being
indiscreet
i
accept
the
advice
and
i
will
refrain
from
speaking
of
it
when
you
return
to
germany
you
may
tell
whatever
you
please
speak
write
publish
it
is
of
no
importance
the
works
published
against
us
do
no
harm
to
any
one
unless
perhaps
to
their
authors
you
are
free
to
relate
the
adventure
if
you
paint
faithfully
what
you
have
seen
the
good
people
of
europe
will
accuse
you
of
traducing
an
illustrious
and
oppressed
people
our
friends
and
we
have
many
among
men
of
sixty
will
tax
you
with
levity
caprice
and
even
of
ingratitude
they
will
recall
that
you
have
been
the
guest
of
and
mine
they
will
reproach
you
with
having
broken
the
holy
laws
of
hospitality
but
the
most
pleasing
thing
of
the
whole
will
be
that
no
one
will
believe
you
the
public
will
place
no
confidence
in
seeming
lies
try
to
persuade
the
cockneys
of
paris
of
london
of
berlin
that
you
have
seen
a
captain
of
the
standing
army
embraced
by
a
chief
of
banditti
a
company
of
choice
troops
acting
as
guards
to
prisoners
in
order
to
give
him
the
opportunity
of
capturing
the
army
coffers
the
highest
state
functionaries
founding
a
stock
company
for
the
purpose
of
plundering
travelers
as
well
tell
them
that
the
mice
of
attica
have
formed
an
alliance
with
the
cats
and
that
our
sheep
take
their
food
from
the
wolves
mouths
do
you
know
what
protects
us
against
the
displeasure
of
europe
it
is
the
improbability
of
our
civilization
happily
for
the
kingdom
everything
which
will
be
written
against
us
will
be
too
unnatural
to
be
believed
i
can
cite
to
you
a
little
book
which
is
not
in
praise
of
us
although
it
is
accurate
from
beginning
to
end
it
has
been
read
somewhat
everywhere
in
paris
they
found
it
curious
but
i
know
of
only
one
city
where
it
seemed
true
athens
i
do
not
prevent
you
from
adding
a
second
volume
but
wait
until
away
if
not
there
possibly
might
be
a
drop
of
blood
on
the
last
page
but
i
answered
if
i
should
commit
an
indiscretion
before
my
departure
how
could
you
know
that
i
was
to
blame
you
alone
are
in
my
secret
the
englishwomen
are
persuaded
that
i
have
delivered
them
from
i
charge
myself
with
keeping
up
the
delusion
until
the
king
return
it
will
be
for
only
two
days
three
at
the
most
we
are
forty
kilometres
from
the
scironian
rocks
our
friend
will
reach
there
in
the
night
they
will
make
the
attack
evening
and
conquerors
or
conquered
they
will
be
here
monday
morning
we
can
prove
to
the
prisoners
that
the
brigands
surprised
us
while
my
godfather
is
absent
i
will
protect
you
against
yourself
by
keeping
you
away
from
these
ladies
i
will
borrow
your
tent
you
ought
to
see
monsieur
that
i
have
a
more
delicate
skin
than
this
worthy
and
that
i
ought
not
to
expose
my
complexion
to
the
changes
of
temperature
what
would
be
said
on
the
at
the
court
ball
if
i
presented
myself
brown
as
a
peasant
i
must
moreover
give
those
poor
captives
the
benefit
of
my
society
it
is
my
duty
as
their
liberator
as
for
you
you
will
sleep
here
in
the
midst
of
my
soldiers
permit
me
to
give
an
order
which
concerns
you
ianni
brigadier
ianni
i
confide
monsieur
to
thy
care
place
around
him
four
guards
who
will
watch
him
night
and
day
accompany
him
everywhere
fully
armed
thou
wilt
relieve
them
every
two
hours
forward
he
saluted
me
with
ironical
politeness
and
humming
a
tune
descended
simons
staircase
the
sentinel
shouldered
arms
from
that
instant
there
began
for
me
a
purgatory
of
which
the
human
mind
can
have
little
conception
everyone
knows
or
guesses
what
a
prison
would
be
but
try
to
imagine
a
living
and
moving
prison
the
four
walls
of
which
come
and
go
recede
and
approach
turn
and
return
rubbing
hands
scratching
blowing
noses
shaking
floundering
about
and
obstinately
fixing
eight
great
black
eyes
upon
the
prisoner
i
tried
to
walk
my
prison
of
eight
feet
regulated
the
step
to
mine
i
went
toward
the
front
of
the
camp
the
two
men
who
preceded
me
stopped
short
i
bumped
into
them
this
incident
explained
to
me
an
inscription
which
i
had
often
seen
without
understanding
it
in
the
neighborhood
of
camps
limit
of
garrison
i
turned
around
my
four
walls
turned
like
the
scenes
in
a
theater
where
a
change
of
view
is
required
at
last
tired
of
this
way
of
promenading
i
sat
down
my
prison
seated
itself
around
me
i
resembled
an
intoxicated
man
who
sees
his
house
turn
i
closed
my
eyes
the
measured
step
of
the
sentinels
wearied
my
brain
at
least
i
thought
if
these
four
soldiers
would
but
speak
to
me
i
spoke
to
them
in
greek
it
was
a
seductive
agent
which
had
never
failed
me
with
sentinels
it
was
clear
loss
of
time
the
walls
had
possibly
ears
but
the
use
of
the
voice
was
denied
them
no
one
spoke
under
arms
i
attempted
bribery
i
drew
from
my
pocket
the
money
which
had
returned
and
which
the
captain
had
forgotten
to
take
from
me
i
distributed
it
to
the
four
cardinal
points
of
my
lodge
the
somber
and
frowning
walls
changed
to
a
smiling
front
and
my
prison
was
illumined
as
with
a
ray
of
sunlight
but
five
minutes
later
the
brigadier
relieved
the
guards
it
was
just
two
hours
that
i
had
been
a
prisoner
the
day
seemed
long
the
night
eternal
the
captain
had
already
taken
possession
of
my
tent
and
my
bed
and
the
rock
which
served
me
for
a
resting
place
was
not
as
soft
as
feather
a
fine
penetrating
rain
cruelly
convinced
me
that
a
roof
was
a
fine
invention
and
that
thatches
rendered
a
true
service
to
society
if
at
times
in
spite
of
my
unpleasant
surroundings
i
dropped
off
to
sleep
i
was
almost
always
awakened
by
the
brigadier
ianni
who
ordered
a
change
of
guards
finally
what
shall
i
say
at
night
and
in
dreams
i
saw
and
her
respectable
mother
in
the
hands
of
their
liberator
ah
monsieur
how
i
began
to
render
justice
to
the
good
old
king
of
the
mountains
how
i
retracted
all
the
maledictions
which
i
had
hurled
against
him
how
i
regretted
his
kind
and
paternal
government
how
i
sighed
for
his
return
how
warmly
did
i
breathe
his
name
in
my
prayers
my
god
i
cried
with
fervor
give
the
victory
to
thy
servant
make
every
soldier
in
the
kingdom
fall
beneath
his
hand
bring
to
his
hands
the
coffer
and
even
to
the
last
écus
of
that
infernal
army
and
let
the
bandits
return
that
we
may
be
delivered
from
the
hands
of
the
soldiers
as
i
finished
this
prayer
a
fire
was
heard
in
the
midst
of
the
camp
this
occurred
many
times
during
the
day
and
following
night
it
was
only
a
trick
of
pericles
in
order
the
better
to
deceive
simons
and
to
persuade
her
that
he
was
defending
her
against
an
army
of
bandits
he
had
ordered
that
volleys
should
be
fired
from
time
to
time
this
pretty
conceit
came
near
costing
him
dear
when
the
brigands
arrived
in
camp
at
dawn
on
monday
morning
they
believed
that
a
fight
was
going
on
with
a
true
enemy
and
they
began
to
fire
some
balls
which
unfortunately
touched
no
one
i
had
never
seen
a
defeated
army
when
i
assisted
at
the
return
of
the
king
of
the
mountains
the
sight
had
for
me
all
the
novelty
of
a
first
experience
heaven
had
listened
unfavorably
to
my
prayers
the
greek
soldiers
had
defended
themselves
with
so
much
ardor
that
the
engagement
was
prolonged
till
night
formed
in
a
square
around
the
two
mules
which
carried
the
treasure
they
had
at
first
returned
a
regular
fire
upon
the
old
palikar
despairing
of
killing
one
by
one
a
hundred
and
twenty
men
who
would
not
give
an
inch
attacked
them
with
bare
blades
his
men
assured
us
that
he
had
performed
marvels
and
the
blood
with
which
he
was
covered
testified
to
it
but
the
bayonet
had
had
the
last
word
in
other
words
had
won
the
day
the
troops
had
killed
forty
brigands
of
which
one
was
a
dog
a
regulation
bullet
had
arrested
the
advancement
of
young
spiro
that
young
officer
with
so
brilliant
a
future
i
saw
march
in
sixty
men
overcome
with
fatigue
dusty
bloody
bruised
and
wounded
sophocles
had
been
shot
in
the
shoulder
the
men
were
carrying
him
the
corfuan
and
a
few
others
had
been
left
on
the
road
some
with
the
shepherds
some
in
a
village
and
others
on
the
bare
rocks
beside
the
path
the
band
was
sad
and
discouraged
sophocles
howled
with
grief
i
heard
some
murmurs
against
the
king
imprudence
who
had
exposed
the
lives
of
his
men
for
a
miserable
sum
instead
of
peaceably
plundering
rich
and
careless
travelers
the
strongest
the
freshest
the
most
content
the
gayest
of
the
lot
was
the
king
his
face
expressed
the
proud
satisfaction
of
a
duty
accomplished
he
recognized
me
at
once
in
the
midst
of
my
four
men
and
cordially
held
out
his
hand
to
me
dear
prisoner
he
said
you
see
a
badly
treated
king
those
dogs
of
soldiers
would
not
give
up
the
treasure
it
was
their
money
my
trip
to
the
scironian
rocks
brought
me
nothing
and
i
have
lost
forty
men
without
counting
some
wounded
who
can
not
live
but
no
matter
i
am
well
beaten
there
were
too
many
of
those
rascals
for
us
and
they
had
bayonets
without
which
come
this
day
has
rejuvenated
me
i
have
proved
to
myself
that
i
still
have
blood
in
my
veins
and
he
hummed
the
first
verse
of
his
favorite
song
un
clephte
aux
yeux
noirs
he
added
by
jupiter
as
lord
byron
said
i
would
not
for
twenty
thousand
francs
have
remained
quietly
at
home
since
saturday
that
can
still
be
put
into
my
history
it
can
be
said
that
at
more
than
sixty
years
of
age
i
fought
with
bare
sabre
in
the
midst
of
bayonets
that
i
killed
three
or
four
soldiers
with
my
own
hand
and
that
i
marched
ten
leagues
in
the
mountains
in
order
to
return
in
time
to
take
my
cup
of
coffee
cafedgi
my
child
do
thy
duty
i
have
done
mine
but
where
the
devil
is
pericles
the
charming
captain
was
still
resting
in
his
tent
ianni
hurried
away
to
bring
him
forth
half
asleep
his
mustache
uncurled
his
head
carefully
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
i
know
of
nothing
which
will
so
thoroughly
awaken
a
man
as
a
glass
of
cold
water
or
bad
news
when
pericles
learned
that
the
little
spiro
and
two
other
soldiers
had
been
left
behind
it
was
truly
another
defeat
he
pulled
off
his
handkerchief
and
but
for
the
respect
he
had
for
his
person
he
would
have
torn
his
hair
this
will
do
for
me
he
cried
how
explain
their
presence
among
you
and
in
bandit
dress
too
they
will
be
recognized
the
others
are
masters
of
the
battle
ground
shall
i
say
that
they
deserted
in
order
to
join
you
that
you
made
them
prisoners
the
question
will
be
asked
why
i
said
nothing
about
it
i
have
waited
for
thy
coming
to
make
my
final
report
i
wrote
last
evening
that
i
had
thee
almost
surrounded
on
parnassus
and
that
all
our
men
were
admirable
holy
virgin
i
shall
not
dare
to
show
myself
sunday
at
patissia
what
will
be
said
the
at
the
court
ball
the
whole
diplomatic
corps
will
talk
me
over
they
will
convene
the
council
will
i
yet
be
invited
to
the
council
asked
the
bandit
no
to
the
court
ball
dancer
go
my
god
my
god
who
knows
what
will
be
done
if
the
only
trouble
was
about
these
englishwomen
i
would
not
worry
myself
i
would
confess
everything
to
the
minister
of
war
these
english
that
was
enough
but
to
lend
my
soldiers
to
attack
the
army
box
to
send
spiro
into
the
engagement
they
will
point
the
finger
at
me
i
shall
never
dance
again
who
was
it
who
rubbed
his
hands
in
glee
during
this
monologue
it
was
the
son
of
my
father
surrounded
by
his
four
soldiers
quietly
seated
enjoyed
his
coffee
in
little
sips
he
said
to
his
godson
thou
seemest
much
troubled
remain
with
us
i
assure
thee
a
minimum
of
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
and
i
will
enroll
thy
men
we
will
take
our
revenge
together
the
offer
was
alluring
two
days
before
it
would
have
received
much
approval
and
even
now
it
caused
a
faint
smile
among
the
soldiers
none
from
the
captain
the
soldiers
said
nothing
they
looked
at
their
old
comrades
they
eyed
sophocles
wound
they
thought
of
the
deaths
of
the
night
before
and
they
turned
wistful
faces
toward
athens
as
if
they
could
inhale
the
to
them
sweet
odor
of
the
barracks
as
for
pericles
he
replied
with
visible
embarrassment
i
thank
thee
but
i
would
need
to
reflect
my
habits
are
those
of
a
city
i
am
delicate
in
health
the
winters
are
rigorous
in
the
mountains
i
have
already
taken
cold
my
absence
would
be
noticed
at
all
assemblies
i
would
be
searched
for
everywhere
fine
marriages
are
often
proposed
to
me
moreover
the
trouble
is
not
so
great
as
we
believe
it
who
knows
whether
the
three
unfortunates
will
be
recognized
will
news
of
the
event
arrive
before
we
do
i
will
go
at
once
to
the
ministry
i
will
find
out
how
matters
stand
no
one
will
come
to
contradict
me
since
the
two
companies
have
kept
on
their
march
to
argos
decidedly
i
must
be
there
i
must
face
the
music
care
for
the
wounded
adieu
he
made
a
sign
to
his
drummer
rose
came
and
placed
himself
in
front
of
me
with
his
godson
whom
he
dominated
by
a
head
and
said
to
me
monsieur
behold
a
greek
of
i
i
am
a
greek
of
former
days
and
the
papers
pretend
that
we
have
progressed
at
the
roll
of
the
drum
the
walls
of
my
prison
fell
away
like
the
ramparts
of
jericho
two
minutes
afterward
i
was
before
tent
mother
and
daughter
hastily
arose
simons
perceived
me
first
and
cried
out
to
me
oh
well
are
we
to
start
alas
madame
we
are
not
there
where
are
we
then
the
captain
gave
us
word
for
this
morning
how
did
you
find
the
captain
gallant
elegant
charming
a
little
too
much
the
slave
of
discipline
it
was
his
only
fault
coxcomb
and
scamp
coward
and
bully
liar
and
thief
those
are
his
true
names
and
i
will
prove
it
to
you
come
monsieur
what
have
the
soldiers
done
to
you
what
have
they
done
to
me
madame
deign
to
come
with
me
only
to
the
top
of
the
staircase
simons
arrived
there
just
in
time
to
see
the
soldiers
defile
past
the
drummer
at
the
head
the
bandits
again
installed
in
their
places
the
captain
and
the
king
mouth
to
mouth
giving
the
last
kiss
the
surprise
was
a
little
too
much
i
had
not
been
sufficiently
considerate
of
the
good
woman
and
i
was
punished
for
it
because
she
fainted
dead
away
and
nearly
broke
my
arms
as
i
caught
her
i
carried
her
to
the
brook
rubbed
and
slapped
her
hands
i
threw
a
handful
of
water
in
her
face
but
i
believe
that
it
was
fury
which
revived
her
miserable
wretch
she
cried
he
has
plundered
you
is
it
not
true
stole
your
watches
your
money
i
do
not
regret
my
jewels
he
may
keep
them
but
i
would
give
ten
thousand
francs
to
get
back
the
handshakes
i
have
given
him
i
am
english
and
i
do
not
clasp
hands
with
every
one
this
regret
of
simons
drew
from
me
a
heavy
sigh
she
let
fall
upon
me
all
the
weight
of
her
anger
it
is
your
fault
she
said
could
you
not
have
warned
me
it
was
only
necessary
to
tell
me
that
the
brigands
were
saints
in
comparison
but
madame
i
advised
you
that
you
must
put
no
faith
in
the
soldiers
you
told
me
so
but
you
said
it
softly
slowly
coldly
could
i
believe
you
could
i
divine
that
this
man
was
only
stavros
jailer
that
he
remained
here
to
give
the
bandits
time
to
get
back
that
he
frightened
us
with
imaginary
dangers
that
he
claimed
to
have
been
besieged
in
order
to
have
us
admire
him
that
he
simulated
the
night
attacks
to
make
it
appear
that
he
was
defending
us
i
see
all
now
but
tell
us
if
you
have
nothing
to
say
my
god
madame
i
told
all
i
knew
i
did
what
i
could
but
german
who
are
you
in
your
place
an
englishman
would
have
sacrificed
his
life
for
us
and
i
would
have
given
him
my
hand
wild
poppies
are
very
scarlet
but
i
was
more
than
that
when
i
heard
simons
speech
i
was
so
troubled
that
i
dared
not
raise
my
eyes
nor
respond
neither
did
i
ask
the
good
woman
what
she
meant
by
her
words
because
in
a
word
why
should
a
person
as
harsh
as
she
had
shown
herself
to
be
use
such
language
before
her
daughter
and
before
me
by
what
door
had
this
idea
of
marriage
entered
her
mind
was
simons
truly
a
woman
to
award
her
daughter
as
an
honest
recompense
to
the
first
liberator
there
were
no
signs
of
it
was
it
not
rather
a
cruel
irony
addressed
to
my
most
secret
thoughts
when
i
examined
myself
i
ascertained
with
legitimate
pride
the
innocent
warmth
of
all
my
sentiments
i
render
this
justice
to
myself
that
the
fire
of
passion
had
not
raised
a
degree
the
temperature
of
my
heart
at
each
instant
of
the
day
in
order
to
test
myself
i
occupied
myself
with
thinking
of
i
built
castles
in
spain
of
which
she
was
the
mistress
i
planned
romances
of
which
she
was
the
heroine
and
i
the
hero
i
thought
of
the
most
absurd
things
i
imagined
events
as
improbable
as
the
history
of
the
princess
ypsoff
and
lieutenant
reynauld
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
see
the
pretty
english
girl
seated
at
my
right
on
the
back
seat
of
a
with
her
beautiful
arm
around
my
long
neck
all
these
flattering
suppositions
which
should
have
agitated
deeply
a
soul
less
philosophical
than
mine
did
not
disturb
my
serenity
i
did
not
experience
the
alternatives
of
fear
and
hope
which
are
the
symptoms
of
love
never
no
never
have
i
felt
those
great
convulsions
of
the
heart
which
are
recorded
in
romances
then
i
did
not
love
i
was
a
man
without
reproach
i
could
walk
with
uplifted
head
but
simons
who
had
not
read
my
thoughts
was
perfectly
capable
of
deceiving
herself
as
to
the
nature
of
my
devotion
who
knows
whether
she
did
not
suspect
me
of
being
in
love
with
her
daughter
whether
she
had
not
misinterpreted
my
trouble
and
my
timidity
whether
she
had
not
let
slip
the
word
marriage
in
order
to
force
me
to
betray
myself
my
pride
revolted
against
so
unjust
a
suspicion
and
i
replied
in
a
firm
tone
without
looking
her
in
the
face
madame
if
i
was
sufficiently
fortunate
to
rescue
you
from
here
i
swear
to
you
that
it
would
not
be
in
order
to
marry
your
daughter
and
why
then
she
asked
in
a
tone
of
pique
is
it
because
my
daughter
is
not
good
enough
for
one
to
marry
i
find
you
agreeable
truly
is
she
not
pretty
enough
or
of
a
good
enough
family
have
i
brought
her
up
improperly
is
she
not
a
good
match
to
marry
miss
simons
my
dear
sir
it
is
a
beautiful
dream
and
most
difficult
to
be
gratified
alas
madame
i
replied
you
have
seriously
misunderstood
me
i
confess
that
mademoiselle
is
perfect
and
if
her
presence
did
not
make
me
timid
i
would
tell
you
what
passionate
admiration
she
inspired
in
me
the
first
day
it
is
precisely
for
that
reason
that
i
have
not
the
impertinence
to
think
that
any
chance
could
raise
me
to
her
level
i
hoped
that
my
humility
would
touch
this
dreadful
mother
but
her
anger
was
not
in
the
least
appeased
why
she
cried
why
are
you
not
worthy
of
my
daughter
answer
me
then
but
madame
i
have
neither
fortune
nor
position
a
fine
affair
no
position
you
would
have
one
monsieur
if
you
married
my
daughter
to
be
my
is
not
that
a
position
you
have
no
fortune
have
we
ever
asked
money
of
you
have
we
not
enough
for
ourselves
for
you
and
for
many
others
moreover
the
man
who
would
rescue
us
from
here
would
he
not
receive
a
present
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
it
is
a
small
sum
i
confess
but
it
is
something
will
you
say
that
a
hundred
thousand
francs
is
a
miserable
sum
then
why
are
you
not
worthy
to
marry
my
daughter
madame
i
am
not
come
what
is
it
you
are
not
you
are
not
english
oh
by
no
means
eh
well
you
can
not
believe
that
we
are
foolish
enough
to
make
a
crime
of
your
birth
eh
monsieur
i
know
very
well
that
it
is
not
permitted
to
all
the
world
to
be
english
the
entire
earth
can
not
be
english
at
least
not
for
many
years
but
one
may
be
an
honest
man
and
a
learned
man
without
having
really
been
born
in
england
as
for
integrity
madame
it
is
a
virtue
which
we
transmit
from
father
to
son
as
for
intelligence
i
have
just
enough
to
be
a
doctor
but
unfortunately
i
have
no
illusions
in
regard
to
my
physical
defects
and
you
wish
to
say
that
you
are
ugly
no
monsieur
you
are
not
ugly
you
have
an
intelligent
face
is
not
monsieur
face
intelligent
yes
mamma
replied
if
she
blushed
as
she
answered
her
mother
saw
it
better
than
i
for
my
eyes
were
fixed
obstinately
on
the
ground
monsieur
added
simons
were
you
ten
times
uglier
you
would
not
then
be
as
ugly
as
my
late
husband
and
more
than
that
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
i
was
as
pretty
as
my
daughter
the
day
i
gave
him
my
hand
what
have
you
to
say
to
that
nothing
madame
except
that
you
confuse
me
and
that
it
will
not
be
my
fault
if
you
are
not
on
the
road
to
athens
what
do
you
count
on
doing
this
time
try
to
find
a
means
less
ridiculous
than
that
the
other
day
i
hope
to
satisfy
you
if
you
will
listen
to
me
to
the
end
yes
monsieur
without
interrupting
me
i
will
not
interrupt
you
have
i
ever
interrupted
you
yes
no
yes
when
always
madame
has
all
his
funds
invested
in
the
firm
of
barley
company
with
our
firm
no
cavendish
square
london
last
wednesday
he
dictated
in
our
presence
a
business
letter
to
mr
barley
and
you
never
told
me
before
you
would
never
give
me
the
opportunity
but
this
is
monstrous
your
conduct
is
inexplicable
we
could
have
been
at
liberty
six
days
ago
i
will
go
straight
to
him
i
will
tell
him
our
relations
and
he
will
demand
of
you
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
francs
believe
me
madame
the
best
way
is
to
say
nothing
to
him
pay
your
ransom
make
him
give
you
a
receipt
and
in
fifteen
days
send
to
him
a
statement
with
the
following
note
francs
paid
personally
by
simons
our
partner
as
per
receipt
in
this
way
you
will
get
back
your
money
without
the
aid
of
the
soldiers
is
it
clear
i
raised
my
eyes
and
saw
the
pretty
smile
which
broke
over
face
as
she
saw
through
the
plot
simons
angrily
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
seemed
moved
only
by
truly
she
said
to
me
you
are
a
wonderful
man
you
proposed
to
us
an
acrobatic
escape
when
we
had
such
simple
means
at
our
command
and
you
have
known
it
since
wednesday
morning
i
will
never
pardon
you
for
not
having
told
me
the
first
day
but
madame
will
you
not
remember
that
i
begged
you
to
write
to
monsieur
your
brother
to
send
you
a
hundred
and
fifteen
thousand
francs
why
a
hundred
and
fifteen
i
mean
to
say
a
hundred
thousand
no
a
hundred
and
fifteen
that
is
right
are
you
sure
that
this
stavros
will
not
keep
us
here
when
he
has
received
the
money
i
will
answer
for
it
the
bandits
are
the
only
greeks
who
never
break
their
word
do
you
not
understand
that
if
it
happened
once
that
they
kept
prisoners
after
having
received
the
ransom
no
one
would
ever
pay
one
again
that
is
true
but
what
a
queer
german
you
are
not
to
have
spoken
sooner
you
always
cut
me
short
you
ought
to
have
spoken
even
then
but
madame
silence
lead
me
to
this
detestable
stavros
the
king
was
breakfasting
on
roast
turtles
seated
with
his
unwounded
officers
under
his
tree
of
justice
he
had
made
his
toilet
he
had
washed
the
blood
from
his
hands
and
changed
his
clothes
he
was
discussing
with
his
men
the
most
expeditious
means
of
filling
the
vacancies
made
by
death
in
his
ranks
vasile
who
was
from
javina
offered
to
find
thirty
men
in
epinus
where
the
watchfulness
of
the
turkish
authorities
had
put
more
than
a
thousand
bandits
in
retreat
a
laconian
wished
that
they
might
get
for
ready
money
the
little
band
belonging
to
spartiate
pavlos
who
had
improved
the
province
of
mague
in
the
neighborhood
of
calamato
the
king
always
imbued
with
english
ideas
thought
of
forced
recruiting
and
of
pressing
into
service
the
attic
shepherds
this
plan
seemed
to
him
to
possess
superior
advantages
as
it
would
require
no
outlay
of
funds
and
he
would
obtain
the
herds
into
the
bargain
interrupted
in
the
midst
of
his
deliberations
gave
his
prisoners
a
cool
reception
he
did
not
offer
even
a
glass
of
water
to
simons
and
she
had
not
yet
breakfasted
she
fully
realized
the
omission
of
this
courtesy
i
took
upon
myself
the
part
of
speaker
and
in
the
corfuan
absence
the
king
was
forced
to
accept
my
services
as
intermediary
i
said
to
him
that
after
the
disaster
of
the
evening
before
he
would
be
glad
to
learn
simons
decision
that
she
would
pay
with
the
briefest
delay
possible
her
ransom
and
mine
that
the
funds
would
be
turned
over
the
next
day
either
to
a
banker
in
athens
or
to
some
other
place
which
he
would
designate
in
exchange
for
his
receipt
i
am
much
pleased
he
said
that
these
ladies
have
renounced
the
idea
of
calling
the
greek
army
to
their
aid
tell
them
that
for
the
second
time
anything
necessary
for
writing
will
be
furnished
them
but
that
they
must
not
abuse
my
confidence
that
they
must
not
draw
the
soldiers
here
at
the
sight
of
the
very
first
soldier
who
appears
on
the
mountain
i
will
cut
off
their
heads
i
swear
it
by
the
virgin
of
the
megaspilion
who
was
carved
by
saint
luke
own
hand
do
not
doubt
i
give
my
word
for
these
ladies
and
myself
where
do
you
wish
to
have
the
sum
left
at
the
national
bank
of
greece
it
is
the
only
one
which
has
not
yet
gone
into
bankruptcy
have
you
a
safe
man
to
carry
the
letter
i
have
the
good
old
man
i
will
send
to
the
convent
for
him
what
time
is
it
nine
in
the
morning
the
reverend
gentleman
has
not
yet
drunk
enough
to
become
tipsy
the
monk
will
do
when
simons
brother
has
turned
over
the
sum
and
taken
your
receipt
the
monk
will
bring
you
the
news
what
receipt
why
a
receipt
i
have
never
given
any
when
you
are
at
liberty
you
will
readily
see
that
you
have
paid
me
what
you
owe
me
i
think
that
a
man
like
you
ought
to
transact
business
according
to
european
methods
in
a
good
administration
i
transact
business
in
my
own
way
and
i
am
too
old
to
change
my
methods
as
you
please
i
ask
it
in
the
interest
of
simons
she
is
guardian
of
her
minor
daughter
and
she
must
render
account
of
her
whole
fortune
but
that
will
arrange
itself
i
care
for
my
interests
as
she
does
for
hers
when
she
pays
for
her
daughter
is
it
a
great
misfortune
i
have
never
regretted
what
i
have
disbursed
for
photini
here
is
the
paper
the
ink
and
the
reeds
be
good
enough
to
watch
the
composition
of
the
letter
it
concerns
your
head
too
i
rose
abashed
and
followed
the
ladies
who
saw
my
confusion
without
knowing
the
cause
but
a
sudden
inspiration
made
me
suddenly
retrace
my
steps
i
said
to
the
king
decidedly
you
were
right
to
refuse
the
receipt
and
i
was
wrong
in
asking
for
it
you
are
wiser
than
i
youth
is
imprudent
what
do
you
say
you
are
right
i
tell
you
it
is
necessary
to
wait
who
knows
if
you
will
not
experience
a
second
defeat
more
terrible
than
the
first
you
are
not
as
strong
as
at
twenty
years
of
age
you
may
fall
a
captive
to
the
soldiers
i
they
will
try
you
as
a
common
malefactor
the
magistrates
will
no
longer
fear
you
in
such
circumstances
a
receipt
for
a
hundred
and
fifteen
thousand
francs
would
be
overwhelming
proof
give
no
weapons
of
justice
to
be
turned
against
you
perhaps
simons
or
her
heirs
would
join
in
a
criminal
suit
to
recover
what
had
been
taken
from
them
never
sign
a
receipt
he
replied
in
thundering
tones
i
will
sign
it
and
two
rather
than
one
i
will
sign
all
as
many
as
need
signing
i
will
sign
them
always
for
anyone
ah
the
soldiers
imagine
that
they
will
manage
me
easily
because
once
chance
and
their
larger
force
gave
them
the
advantage
i
fall
living
into
their
hands
i
whose
arm
is
proof
against
fatigue
and
whose
head
is
proof
against
bullets
i
seat
myself
on
a
bench
before
a
judge
like
a
peasant
who
has
stolen
cabbages
young
man
you
do
not
yet
know
it
would
be
easier
to
pluck
up
parnassus
and
place
it
upon
the
summit
of
taygète
than
to
tear
me
from
my
mountains
and
place
me
on
a
court
bench
write
for
me
in
greek
madame
simons
name
good
yours
also
it
is
not
necessary
and
write
you
know
my
name
and
i
am
sure
that
you
will
not
forget
it
i
wish
to
have
yours
to
hold
as
a
souvenir
i
wrote
my
name
as
best
i
could
in
the
harmonious
language
of
plato
the
king
lieutenants
applauded
his
firmness
without
understanding
that
it
would
cost
him
a
hundred
and
fifteen
thousand
francs
i
hurried
with
a
light
heart
and
much
pleased
with
myself
to
simons
tent
i
told
her
that
her
money
had
had
a
narrow
escape
and
she
deigned
to
smile
on
learning
that
i
had
pretended
to
be
deceived
in
order
to
rob
our
robbers
a
half
hour
afterward
she
submitted
for
my
approval
the
following
letter
my
dear
brother
the
gendarmes
whom
you
sent
to
our
rescue
were
treacherous
and
fled
ignominiously
i
advise
you
to
see
that
they
are
hung
they
will
need
a
gallows
a
hundred
feet
high
for
their
captain
pericles
i
shall
complain
of
him
especially
in
the
dispatch
which
i
intend
to
send
to
lord
palmerston
and
i
shall
consecrate
to
him
a
portion
of
the
letter
which
i
shall
write
to
the
editor
of
the
times
as
soon
as
you
have
set
us
free
it
is
useless
to
hope
anything
from
the
local
authorities
all
the
natives
are
leagued
against
us
and
the
day
after
our
departure
the
greeks
will
gather
in
some
corner
of
the
kingdom
to
divide
what
they
have
taken
from
us
fortunately
they
will
have
little
i
have
learned
from
a
young
german
whom
i
took
at
first
for
a
spy
and
who
is
a
very
honest
man
that
this
stavros
called
has
funds
placed
with
our
firm
i
beg
you
to
verify
the
fact
and
if
it
is
true
let
nothing
prevent
you
from
paying
the
ransom
which
is
demanded
turn
over
to
the
bank
of
greece
francs
sterling
for
a
regular
receipt
sealed
with
this
stavros
seal
the
amount
will
be
charged
to
his
account
our
health
is
good
although
life
in
the
mountains
may
not
be
comfortable
it
is
monstrous
that
two
english
women
citizens
of
the
greatest
kingdom
in
the
world
should
be
compelled
to
eat
their
roast
without
mustard
and
without
pickles
and
to
drink
pure
water
like
any
fish
hoping
that
you
will
not
delay
in
arranging
for
our
return
to
our
accustomed
habits
i
am
my
dear
brother
very
sincerely
yours
rebecca
simons
i
carried
to
the
king
the
good
woman
letter
he
took
it
with
defiance
and
examined
it
so
sharply
that
i
trembled
lest
he
should
understand
it
i
was
however
very
sure
that
he
knew
no
english
but
this
devil
of
a
man
inspired
me
with
superstitious
terror
and
i
believed
him
capable
of
performing
miracles
he
seemed
satisfied
only
when
he
reached
the
figures
livres
sterling
he
saw
at
once
that
he
was
not
to
be
troubled
with
the
gendarmes
the
letter
was
placed
with
other
papers
in
a
tin
cylinder
they
brought
forward
the
good
old
man
who
had
drunk
just
enough
wine
to
limber
up
his
legs
and
the
king
gave
the
box
to
him
with
very
explicit
instructions
he
departed
and
my
heart
kept
pace
with
him
to
the
end
of
his
journey
horace
did
not
follow
with
a
more
tender
look
the
ship
which
bore
virgil
away
as
soon
as
the
king
saw
the
affair
in
train
to
be
completed
he
became
very
genial
he
ordered
for
us
a
veritable
feast
he
distributed
double
rations
of
wine
to
his
men
he
went
himself
to
look
after
the
wounded
and
with
his
own
hands
extracted
the
ball
from
sophocles
shoulder
orders
were
given
the
bandits
to
treat
us
with
the
respect
due
our
money
the
breakfast
which
i
ate
without
spectators
with
the
ladies
was
one
of
the
happiest
repasts
i
ever
remember
all
my
evils
were
then
ended
i
should
be
free
after
two
days
of
this
sweet
captivity
perhaps
even
on
leaving
an
adorable
slavery
i
felt
that
i
was
a
poet
like
gessner
i
ate
as
heartily
as
simons
and
i
assuredly
drank
with
more
appetite
i
gulped
down
the
white
wine
of
aegina
as
formerly
the
wine
of
santorin
i
drank
to
health
to
her
mother
to
my
good
parents
and
to
that
of
princess
ypsoff
simons
wished
to
hear
the
history
of
that
noble
stranger
and
by
my
faith
i
did
not
keep
it
secret
good
examples
are
never
too
well
known
gave
charming
attention
to
my
recital
she
thought
that
the
princess
had
done
well
and
that
a
woman
ought
to
take
her
happiness
wherever
she
found
it
proverbs
are
the
wisdom
of
nations
and
sometimes
their
success
i
was
cast
upon
the
wind
of
prosperity
and
i
felt
myself
borne
toward
i
know
not
what
terrestrial
paradise
oh
the
sailors
who
traverse
the
ocean
have
never
had
for
guides
two
stars
like
your
eyes
i
was
seated
before
her
passing
the
wing
of
a
fowl
to
her
i
leaned
so
near
her
that
i
saw
my
image
reflected
in
her
eyes
i
found
i
looked
well
monsieur
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
the
frame
set
off
the
picture
so
well
a
strange
thought
seized
me
i
felt
that
i
had
surprised
in
this
incident
a
decree
of
destiny
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
beautiful
carried
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
the
image
which
i
had
discovered
in
her
eyes
all
this
was
not
love
i
know
it
well
i
wish
neither
to
accuse
myself
nor
to
appropriate
to
myself
a
sentiment
which
i
have
never
felt
but
it
was
a
firm
friendship
and
which
would
suffice
i
thought
for
a
man
about
to
enter
the
wedded
state
no
turbulent
emotion
stirred
my
heart
but
i
felt
it
melting
slowly
like
a
piece
of
wax
in
the
warmth
of
a
genial
sun
under
the
influence
of
this
reasonable
ecstasy
i
related
to
and
her
mother
the
history
of
my
life
i
described
to
them
the
paternal
mansion
the
great
kitchen
where
we
all
ate
together
the
copper
hanging
on
the
wall
according
to
size
the
strings
of
hams
and
sausages
which
hung
in
the
inside
of
the
chimney
our
modest
and
often
hard
life
the
future
of
each
of
my
brothers
henri
ought
to
succeed
papa
frederic
was
learning
the
tailor
trade
frantz
and
had
had
positions
since
they
were
eighteen
the
one
as
corporal
the
other
as
sergeant
i
told
them
of
studies
my
examinations
the
little
successes
which
i
had
enjoyed
at
the
university
the
beautiful
future
of
professor
to
which
i
could
lay
claim
with
three
thousand
francs
income
at
least
i
do
not
know
to
what
point
my
recital
interested
them
but
i
took
great
pleasure
in
it
and
i
stopped
to
drink
from
time
to
time
simons
did
not
speak
to
me
again
about
our
discussion
on
marriage
and
i
was
very
happy
it
is
better
not
to
say
a
word
than
to
talk
in
the
air
when
we
know
ourselves
so
little
the
day
passed
for
me
like
an
hour
i
mean
as
an
hour
of
pleasure
the
next
day
seemed
long
to
simons
as
for
me
i
would
have
liked
to
stop
the
sun
in
its
course
i
instructed
in
the
first
principles
of
botany
ah
monsieur
the
world
does
not
know
all
the
tender
and
delicate
sentiments
one
can
express
in
a
lesson
in
botany
at
last
on
wednesday
morning
the
monk
appeared
on
the
horizon
he
was
a
worthy
man
taken
altogether
this
little
monk
he
had
risen
before
dawn
in
order
to
bring
us
liberty
in
his
pocket
he
brought
to
the
king
a
letter
from
the
president
of
the
bank
and
to
simons
a
letter
from
her
brother
said
to
simons
you
are
free
madame
and
you
may
take
mademoiselle
your
daughter
away
i
hope
that
you
will
not
take
away
from
our
rocks
too
unpleasant
memories
we
have
offered
you
all
that
we
have
if
the
bed
and
the
table
have
not
been
worthy
of
you
it
is
the
fault
of
circumstances
i
had
this
morning
an
angry
fit
which
i
pray
you
to
forget
one
must
pardon
a
conquered
general
if
i
dared
to
offer
a
little
present
to
mademoiselle
i
would
beg
her
to
accept
an
antique
ring
which
could
be
made
to
fit
her
finger
it
does
not
come
from
any
plunder
we
have
taken
i
bought
it
of
a
merchant
of
nauplie
mademoiselle
will
show
this
jewel
in
england
in
relating
her
visit
to
the
king
of
the
mountains
i
faithfully
translated
this
little
speech
and
i
slipped
the
ring
on
finger
myself
and
i
i
asked
of
shall
i
carry
away
nothing
by
which
to
remember
you
you
dear
sir
but
you
remain
your
ransom
is
not
paid
i
turned
toward
simons
who
held
out
to
me
the
following
letter
dear
sister
verification
made
i
have
given
the
liv
sterl
for
the
receipt
i
have
not
advanced
the
other
because
the
receipt
was
not
in
your
name
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
recover
it
i
am
while
waiting
your
dear
presence
always
yours
edward
sharper
i
had
overdone
my
instructions
to
to
be
quite
he
believed
that
he
ought
to
send
two
receipts
simons
said
to
me
in
a
low
tone
you
seem
to
be
in
great
trouble
what
good
will
it
do
to
make
such
faces
show
that
you
are
a
man
and
leave
that
grievance
for
a
whipped
cur
the
best
part
is
done
since
we
are
saved
my
daughter
and
i
without
its
costing
us
anything
as
for
you
i
am
not
uneasy
about
you
you
know
how
to
save
yourself
your
first
plan
which
was
not
feasible
for
two
ladies
will
be
an
admirable
one
for
you
alone
come
what
day
may
we
expect
a
visit
from
you
i
thanked
her
cordially
she
offered
such
a
fine
opportunity
for
me
to
show
off
my
personal
qualities
and
to
raise
myself
in
esteem
yes
madame
count
on
me
i
will
leave
here
a
man
of
spirit
and
much
better
if
i
run
a
little
danger
i
am
glad
that
my
ransom
has
not
been
paid
and
i
thank
monsieur
your
brother
for
what
he
has
done
for
me
you
will
see
if
a
german
does
not
know
how
to
extricate
himself
from
difficulties
yes
i
will
soon
bring
you
my
own
messages
once
out
of
here
do
not
fail
to
present
yourself
at
our
hotel
oh
madame
and
now
beg
this
stavros
to
give
us
an
escort
of
five
or
six
brigands
in
god
name
why
to
protect
us
from
the
gendarmes
vi
the
escape
in
the
midst
of
our
adieux
there
came
to
us
a
powerful
odor
of
garlic
which
made
me
ill
it
was
the
who
had
come
to
the
ladies
to
call
upon
their
generosity
this
creature
had
been
more
annoying
than
useful
and
since
the
first
two
days
the
ladies
had
dispensed
with
her
services
simons
regretted
however
not
being
able
to
do
anything
for
her
and
asked
me
to
inform
the
king
how
she
had
been
robbed
of
her
money
seemed
neither
surprised
nor
scandalized
he
simply
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
muttered
that
pericles
bad
education
the
city
the
court
i
ought
to
attend
to
that
he
added
out
loud
beg
the
ladies
to
not
trouble
themselves
about
anything
it
is
i
who
provided
the
servant
and
it
is
i
who
will
pay
her
tell
them
that
if
they
need
a
little
money
to
return
to
the
city
my
purse
is
at
their
disposal
i
will
have
them
escorted
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
although
they
will
run
no
kind
of
danger
the
soldiers
are
less
to
be
feared
than
one
thinks
they
will
find
breakfast
horses
and
a
guide
in
the
village
of
castia
everything
is
provided
and
everything
paid
do
you
think
that
they
will
give
me
the
pleasure
of
shaking
hands
with
me
in
token
of
reconciliation
simons
was
very
reluctant
but
her
daughter
resolutely
held
out
her
hand
to
the
old
palikar
she
said
to
him
in
english
with
roguish
pleasantry
it
is
much
honor
that
you
do
us
very
interesting
sir
because
at
this
moment
we
are
the
clephtes
and
you
are
the
victim
the
king
replied
with
much
confidence
thank
you
mademoiselle
you
are
too
good
pretty
hand
was
colored
like
a
piece
of
rosy
satin
which
had
been
in
a
for
three
months
believe
however
that
i
did
not
have
to
beg
to
kiss
it
i
then
touched
my
lips
to
simons
skinny
hand
courage
monsieur
cried
the
old
lady
as
she
was
going
away
said
nothing
but
she
threw
me
a
glance
capable
of
rousing
an
army
such
looks
are
worth
a
proclamation
when
the
last
man
of
the
escort
had
disappeared
took
me
to
one
side
and
said
to
me
eh
well
we
have
then
made
some
mistake
alas
yes
we
were
not
clever
this
ransom
is
not
paid
will
it
be
i
believe
so
these
english
women
seem
to
be
friendly
to
you
be
not
uneasy
within
three
days
i
shall
be
far
from
parnassus
all
right
so
much
the
better
i
have
great
need
of
money
as
you
know
our
bad
luck
on
monday
will
tax
our
income
heavily
we
must
make
up
our
personal
and
material
losses
you
can
complain
with
good
grace
you
have
obtained
a
hundred
thousand
francs
at
one
stroke
no
ninety
the
monk
has
already
taken
his
tithe
of
that
sum
which
seems
enormous
to
you
there
will
be
only
twenty
thousand
for
me
our
expenses
are
considerable
there
are
heavy
charges
what
would
be
done
if
the
company
of
should
decide
to
build
a
hotel
des
invalides
as
has
been
talked
of
there
are
always
pensions
to
be
paid
to
the
widows
and
orphans
of
the
band
fever
and
bullets
yearly
relieve
us
of
thirty
men
and
you
can
see
where
that
places
us
our
expenses
would
scarcely
be
met
i
should
have
to
pay
money
out
of
my
own
pocket
my
dear
sir
have
you
never
happened
to
lose
more
than
once
once
only
i
had
received
fifty
thousand
francs
on
account
of
the
society
one
of
my
secretaries
whom
i
afterward
hung
fled
to
thessaly
with
the
sum
i
had
to
make
up
the
deficit
i
was
responsible
my
share
amounted
to
seven
thousand
francs
i
lost
then
thousand
but
the
knave
who
stole
from
me
paid
dearly
i
punished
him
according
to
the
persian
mode
before
hanging
him
his
teeth
were
pulled
one
after
the
other
and
they
were
driven
with
a
mallet
into
his
cranium
for
a
good
example
you
understand
i
am
not
wicked
but
i
suffer
no
one
to
put
me
in
the
wrong
it
rejoiced
my
heart
that
the
old
palikar
who
was
not
wicked
should
lose
the
eighty
thousand
francs
of
simons
ransom
and
that
he
would
receive
the
news
when
my
cranium
and
my
teeth
were
not
in
his
camp
he
put
his
arm
through
mine
and
said
familiarly
how
are
you
going
to
kill
the
time
till
your
departure
these
ladies
are
gone
and
the
house
will
seem
large
do
you
wish
to
look
at
the
athenian
papers
the
monk
brought
some
to
me
i
rarely
read
them
i
know
exactly
the
price
the
articles
are
worth
since
i
pay
for
them
here
you
will
find
the
gazette
officielle
pallicare
caricature
each
one
ought
to
speak
of
us
poor
readers
i
leave
you
if
you
find
anything
curious
tell
me
about
it
printed
in
french
and
intended
to
fool
europe
devoted
a
long
article
to
denying
the
latest
news
of
brigandage
it
cleverly
joked
the
simple
travelers
who
saw
a
thief
in
every
ragged
peasant
an
armed
band
in
every
cloud
of
dust
and
who
asked
pardon
of
the
first
on
which
their
clothes
were
caught
this
sheet
vaunted
the
security
of
the
roads
celebrated
the
disinterestedness
of
the
natives
exalted
the
quiet
and
seclusion
which
one
was
sure
of
finding
on
all
the
mountains
in
the
kingdom
the
pallicare
printed
under
the
supervision
of
some
of
friends
contained
an
eloquent
biography
of
its
hero
it
recounted
that
this
theseus
of
modern
times
the
only
man
in
our
century
who
had
never
been
vanquished
had
made
a
sortie
in
the
direction
of
the
scironian
rock
betrayed
by
the
weakness
of
his
companions
he
had
withdrawn
with
small
loss
but
seized
with
profound
distaste
for
a
degenerate
profession
he
had
renounced
henceforth
the
practice
of
brigandage
and
had
left
greece
he
had
exiled
himself
in
europe
where
his
fortune
gloriously
acquired
would
enable
him
to
live
like
a
prince
and
now
added
the
pallicare
go
come
travel
across
the
plain
and
in
the
mountain
bankers
and
merchants
greeks
strangers
travelers
you
have
nothing
to
fear
the
king
of
the
mountains
wished
like
charles
to
abdicate
at
the
height
of
his
glory
and
power
the
gazette
officielle
read
as
follows
sunday
instant
at
in
the
evening
the
military
chest
containing
francs
which
a
large
company
was
guarding
on
its
way
to
argos
was
attacked
by
the
band
of
known
as
the
king
of
the
mountains
the
brigands
to
the
number
of
three
or
four
hundred
fell
upon
the
soldiers
with
incredible
ferocity
but
the
first
two
companies
of
the
second
battalion
of
the
line
under
the
command
of
the
brave
nicolaidis
opposed
them
with
a
heroic
resistance
the
savage
attacking
party
were
repulsed
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
and
left
the
field
covered
with
the
dead
report
has
it
that
was
seriously
wounded
our
loss
was
insignificant
the
same
day
and
the
same
hour
her
majesty
troops
were
victors
in
another
skirmish
about
ten
leagues
distant
it
was
at
the
summit
of
parnassus
four
furlongs
from
castia
that
the
company
of
the
battalion
of
gendarmes
defeated
band
there
according
to
the
report
of
the
brave
captain
pericles
the
king
of
the
mountains
was
wounded
unfortunately
this
success
was
dearly
bought
the
brigands
protected
by
the
rocks
and
shrubs
had
killed
or
seriously
wounded
ten
of
the
soldiers
a
young
officer
spiro
graduate
of
the
erelpides
school
died
a
heroic
death
on
the
field
of
battle
in
the
presence
of
such
great
misfortunes
it
is
no
mean
consolation
that
there
as
everywhere
the
law
reigns
the
journal
la
caricature
contained
a
badly
printed
lithograph
in
which
i
recognized
however
captain
pericles
and
the
king
of
the
mountains
the
godson
and
godfather
were
holding
each
other
in
close
embrace
below
this
cartoon
the
artist
had
written
the
following
sentence
this
is
how
they
fought
it
seems
i
said
to
myself
that
i
am
not
alone
in
their
confidence
and
that
pericles
secret
is
an
open
secret
i
folded
up
the
papers
and
while
waiting
the
king
return
i
meditated
upon
the
position
in
which
simons
had
left
me
surely
it
was
fine
to
owe
my
freedom
to
no
one
but
myself
and
much
braver
to
leave
a
prison
by
a
feat
of
courage
than
by
a
schoolboy
trick
i
could
in
a
day
or
two
become
a
hero
of
romance
and
the
object
of
admiration
of
all
the
young
girls
in
europe
no
doubt
would
adore
me
when
she
saw
me
safe
and
sound
after
so
perilous
an
escape
i
might
make
a
misstep
in
that
slippery
path
what
if
i
broke
a
leg
or
arm
would
look
with
favor
on
a
lame
and
crippled
man
i
must
moreover
expect
to
be
guarded
night
and
day
my
plan
ingenious
as
it
was
could
be
executed
only
after
the
death
of
my
guard
to
kill
a
man
is
no
small
affair
even
for
a
doctor
it
is
nothing
in
words
especially
when
one
speaks
to
the
woman
whom
one
loves
but
since
departure
i
was
no
longer
deranged
it
seemed
less
easy
to
procure
a
weapon
and
to
use
it
a
poniard
thrust
is
a
surgical
operation
which
ought
to
make
an
honest
man
flesh
creep
what
do
you
say
monsieur
i
think
that
my
future
had
treated
her
very
contemptuously
it
would
not
have
cost
her
much
to
have
sent
me
francs
ransom
taking
them
later
out
of
dowry
fifteen
thousand
francs
would
have
been
of
little
value
to
me
the
day
of
my
marriage
it
seemed
of
much
account
in
the
condition
in
which
i
found
myself
on
the
eve
of
murdering
a
man
and
descending
some
hundreds
of
meters
by
a
ladder
without
any
rungs
i
cursed
simons
as
heartily
as
the
generality
of
curse
their
in
all
civilized
lands
as
i
had
maledictions
to
spare
i
directed
some
of
them
against
my
friend
john
harris
who
had
abandoned
me
to
my
lot
i
said
to
myself
that
if
we
could
have
exchanged
places
that
i
would
never
have
left
him
eight
days
without
news
i
excused
lobster
who
was
very
young
and
giacomo
who
was
not
very
intelligent
and
also
mérinay
whose
downright
selfishness
i
fully
understood
one
easily
pardons
treason
in
such
egotists
because
one
never
counts
on
them
but
harris
who
had
risked
his
life
to
save
an
old
negress
in
boston
was
i
not
of
as
much
account
as
a
negress
i
believed
in
truth
without
any
aristocratic
prejudices
that
i
was
worth
two
or
three
times
as
much
came
to
change
the
course
of
my
thoughts
by
offering
a
means
of
escape
more
simple
and
less
dangerous
it
was
only
necessary
to
have
legs
and
thank
god
i
was
not
lacking
in
that
particular
the
king
surprised
me
just
as
i
was
yawning
fearfully
do
you
feel
dull
he
asked
it
is
the
reading
i
never
can
open
a
book
without
fear
of
dislocating
my
jaws
i
am
pleased
to
see
that
doctors
can
not
endure
it
any
better
than
i
but
why
not
employ
the
time
you
remain
to
better
advantage
you
came
here
to
gather
the
mountain
plants
your
box
has
received
nothing
these
eight
days
would
you
like
to
search
for
some
under
guard
of
two
men
i
am
too
good
a
fellow
for
you
to
refuse
this
little
favor
each
must
pursue
his
course
in
this
lower
world
you
collect
plants
i
money
you
can
say
to
those
who
sent
you
here
are
plants
gathered
in
kingdom
if
you
find
one
which
is
beautiful
and
strange
and
of
which
one
has
never
heard
in
your
country
you
must
give
it
my
name
and
call
it
the
queen
of
the
mountains
but
truly
i
thought
if
i
was
a
league
from
here
with
two
brigands
would
it
not
be
possible
to
them
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
danger
would
give
me
double
strength
he
who
runs
best
is
he
who
has
the
most
to
gain
why
is
the
hare
the
swiftest
of
all
animals
because
he
is
the
most
terrified
i
accepted
the
king
offer
and
on
the
spot
he
placed
two
guards
over
me
he
gave
them
no
minute
instructions
he
simply
said
here
is
milord
worth
francs
if
you
lose
him
you
will
have
to
bring
him
back
or
pay
the
sum
my
attendants
did
not
look
like
invalids
they
had
neither
wounds
bruises
nor
injury
of
any
sort
their
muscles
were
like
steel
and
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
they
would
be
retarded
by
any
constraint
of
their
because
they
wore
large
moccasins
which
left
their
heels
bare
passing
them
in
review
i
noticed
not
without
regret
two
pistols
as
long
as
children
guns
i
however
did
not
lose
courage
by
reason
of
keeping
bad
company
the
whizzing
of
bullets
had
become
familiar
to
me
i
slung
my
box
over
my
shoulder
and
started
much
pleasure
to
you
cried
the
king
adieu
sire
not
so
if
you
please
au
revoir
i
drew
my
companions
in
the
direction
of
athens
it
was
so
much
gained
from
the
enemy
they
made
no
resistance
and
allowed
me
to
go
where
i
wished
these
bandits
much
better
brought
up
than
pericles
four
guards
allowed
me
plenty
of
room
i
did
not
feel
at
each
step
the
point
of
their
elbows
in
my
ribs
they
picked
on
the
path
green
stuff
for
the
evening
meal
as
for
me
i
appeared
very
eager
in
my
work
i
pulled
up
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
tufts
of
grass
of
no
account
i
pretended
to
choose
a
sprig
from
the
mass
and
i
placed
it
very
carefully
in
the
bottom
of
my
box
taking
care
not
to
overload
myself
it
was
enough
of
a
burden
that
i
carried
i
had
once
known
at
a
horse
race
of
a
jockey
who
was
beaten
because
he
carried
a
burden
weighing
five
kilogrammes
my
gaze
seemed
fixed
upon
the
ground
but
you
can
well
believe
that
the
interest
was
feigned
under
such
circumstances
one
is
not
a
botanist
one
is
a
prisoner
pellison
would
never
have
amused
himself
with
spiders
if
he
had
had
a
file
with
which
to
saw
his
bars
i
may
have
perhaps
seen
that
day
unknown
plants
which
would
have
made
a
naturalist
fortune
but
i
troubled
myself
no
more
about
them
than
as
if
they
had
been
common
i
am
sure
that
i
passed
near
a
fine
specimen
of
the
boryana
variabilis
it
would
have
weighed
a
with
its
roots
i
did
not
even
honor
it
with
a
look
i
saw
only
two
things
athens
in
the
distance
and
the
two
brigands
on
either
side
i
secretly
watched
the
rascals
eyes
in
the
hope
that
something
would
distract
their
attention
but
whether
they
were
right
at
hand
or
ten
feet
away
whether
they
were
occupied
in
picking
their
salads
or
following
the
flight
of
the
vultures
they
kept
an
incessant
watch
on
my
movements
an
idea
came
to
me
to
give
them
serious
occupation
we
were
in
a
narrow
path
which
evidently
led
towards
athens
i
saw
at
my
left
a
beautiful
bunch
of
broom
which
grew
on
the
top
of
a
rock
i
pretended
to
be
eager
to
secure
it
as
a
treasure
i
made
five
or
six
attempts
to
scale
the
precipitous
bowlder
on
which
it
blossomed
i
seemed
so
determined
to
reach
it
that
one
of
my
guards
offered
himself
as
a
short
ladder
this
was
not
exactly
what
i
had
counted
on
i
felt
obliged
to
accept
his
services
but
in
climbing
upon
his
shoulders
i
hurt
him
so
cruelly
with
my
shoes
that
he
groaned
with
agony
and
let
me
drop
to
the
ground
his
comrade
who
was
interested
in
the
process
of
the
enterprise
said
to
him
wait
i
will
mount
instead
of
milord
i
have
no
nails
in
my
shoes
no
sooner
said
than
done
he
sprang
up
seized
it
by
the
stalk
shook
it
pulled
it
tore
it
up
by
the
root
and
cried
out
i
was
already
running
away
without
looking
behind
their
stupefaction
gave
me
a
good
ten
seconds
advantage
but
they
lost
no
time
in
accusing
each
other
for
i
soon
heard
them
following
me
i
redoubled
my
efforts
the
path
was
a
good
one
even
smooth
made
for
me
we
descended
a
steep
declivity
i
ran
desperately
my
arms
pressed
to
my
sides
without
noticing
the
stones
which
rolled
under
my
heels
or
looking
to
see
where
i
put
my
feet
i
fairly
flew
over
the
path
rocks
and
bushes
on
either
side
seemed
to
be
running
in
the
opposite
direction
i
was
i
was
supple
my
body
weighed
little
i
had
wings
but
the
four
wearied
my
ears
suddenly
they
ceased
i
heard
nothing
more
had
they
become
weary
of
following
me
a
little
cloud
of
dust
rose
ten
steps
ahead
of
me
a
little
further
on
a
white
spot
suddenly
appeared
on
a
gray
rock
i
heard
two
detonations
at
the
same
instant
the
brigands
had
discharged
their
pistols
i
was
not
hit
and
i
still
sped
on
the
pursuit
began
again
i
heard
the
breathless
voices
calling
to
me
stop
stop
i
did
not
stop
i
lost
the
path
but
i
still
ran
on
not
knowing
where
i
was
going
a
ditch
as
wide
as
a
river
presented
itself
but
i
was
flying
too
fast
to
measure
distances
i
jumped
i
was
saved
my
suspenders
broke
i
was
lost
you
laugh
i
would
like
to
see
you
run
without
suspenders
holding
in
both
hands
the
band
of
your
trousers
five
minutes
afterward
i
was
again
a
captive
the
men
me
fettered
my
legs
and
drove
me
with
switches
to
camp
the
king
treated
me
as
a
bankrupt
who
had
carried
away
francs
monsieur
he
said
to
me
i
had
a
better
opinion
of
you
i
thought
i
knew
honest
men
your
face
deceived
me
i
would
never
have
believed
that
you
were
capable
of
doing
wrong
above
all
after
the
way
in
which
i
have
treated
you
do
not
be
astonished
if
i
henceforth
use
severe
measures
you
have
forced
me
to
do
so
you
will
remain
in
your
chamber
until
further
orders
one
of
my
officers
will
remain
with
you
under
your
tent
this
is
only
a
precaution
in
case
of
a
repetition
of
the
offense
it
is
punishment
which
will
be
given
you
vasile
it
is
to
thee
i
commit
monsieur
vasile
saluted
me
with
his
usual
courtesy
ah
wretch
i
thought
it
is
thou
who
throwest
infants
into
the
fire
it
is
thou
who
wouldst
have
embraced
it
is
thou
who
wouldst
have
stabbed
me
on
ascension
day
oh
well
i
prefer
to
settle
with
thee
rather
than
with
another
i
will
not
relate
to
you
the
details
of
the
three
days
i
passed
in
my
tent
with
vasile
the
scamp
gave
me
a
dose
of
disgust
which
i
do
not
wish
to
share
with
anyone
he
did
not
wish
me
any
ill
he
even
had
a
certain
sympathy
for
me
i
believe
that
if
i
had
been
his
own
prisoner
that
he
would
have
released
me
without
ransom
my
face
had
pleased
him
at
first
sight
i
recalled
to
him
a
younger
brother
who
had
been
condemned
to
death
and
hanged
but
these
friendly
overtures
wearied
me
a
hundred
times
more
than
bad
treatment
he
did
not
wait
until
sunrise
to
say
to
me
at
he
never
missed
a
long
list
of
successes
which
he
wished
me
he
aroused
me
in
my
deepest
sleep
to
ascertain
if
i
was
well
covered
at
table
he
gave
me
good
service
at
dessert
he
begged
of
me
to
listen
to
some
stories
which
he
wished
to
relate
and
always
that
hand
was
before
me
ready
to
shake
mine
i
fiercely
opposed
his
advances
it
seemed
to
me
unnecessary
to
include
a
roaster
of
infants
in
my
list
of
friends
and
i
had
no
desire
to
press
the
hand
of
a
man
whom
i
had
condemned
to
death
my
conscience
permitted
me
to
kill
him
was
it
not
a
case
of
legitimate
defense
but
i
did
have
scruples
about
killing
him
treacherously
and
i
ought
at
least
to
put
him
on
his
guard
by
hostile
and
menacing
attitude
while
repulsing
his
advances
his
kindness
and
repelling
his
polite
attentions
i
carefully
watched
for
a
chance
to
escape
but
his
friendship
more
vigilant
than
hate
did
not
lose
sight
of
me
for
an
instant
when
i
hung
over
the
cascade
in
order
to
impress
upon
my
mind
the
unequal
places
in
the
bank
vasile
would
draw
me
from
my
contemplation
with
maternal
solicitude
take
care
he
would
say
to
me
pulling
me
back
by
the
feet
if
thou
shouldst
fall
by
some
unhappy
chance
i
should
reproach
myself
all
my
life
when
at
night
i
stealthily
tried
to
rise
he
jumped
from
his
bed
asking
if
i
needed
anything
never
was
there
a
more
watchful
rascal
he
turned
around
me
like
a
squirrel
in
a
cage
what
above
everything
made
me
despair
was
the
confidence
he
had
in
me
i
expressed
one
day
a
desire
to
examine
his
arms
he
placed
his
dagger
in
my
hand
it
was
russian
blade
of
inlaid
steel
from
the
famous
sword
factory
of
toula
i
drew
it
from
its
sheath
i
tried
the
point
with
my
finger
i
turned
it
toward
his
breast
choosing
the
place
between
the
fourth
and
fifth
ribs
do
not
press
on
it
thou
mightest
kill
me
truly
by
pressing
on
it
a
little
i
could
have
given
him
his
just
desserts
but
something
stayed
my
hand
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
honest
men
recoil
from
killing
assassins
when
the
latter
feel
no
compunctions
about
killing
honest
people
i
put
the
weapon
back
into
its
case
vasile
held
out
his
pistol
to
me
but
i
refused
it
and
i
told
him
that
my
curiosity
was
satisfied
he
cocked
it
he
made
me
look
at
the
priming
he
placed
it
on
his
head
and
said
to
me
see
thou
art
no
longer
guarded
no
longer
guarded
eh
parbleu
that
was
exactly
what
i
wished
but
the
occasion
was
too
good
a
one
and
the
traitor
paralyzed
me
if
i
had
killed
him
at
such
a
moment
i
would
not
have
felt
equal
to
enduring
his
last
look
much
better
to
give
the
blow
in
the
night
unfortunately
instead
of
hiding
his
arms
he
placed
them
ostensibly
between
his
bed
and
mine
at
last
i
conceived
a
plan
for
escaping
without
awakening
him
or
killing
him
the
idea
flashed
across
my
mind
sunday
the
day
of
may
at
i
had
noticed
on
ascension
day
that
vasile
loved
to
drink
and
that
it
took
but
little
wine
to
intoxicate
him
i
invited
him
to
dine
with
me
this
exhibition
of
friendship
mounted
to
his
brain
the
wine
of
aegina
did
the
rest
who
had
not
honored
me
with
a
visit
since
i
had
lost
his
esteem
still
acted
as
a
generous
host
my
table
was
better
served
than
his
own
i
could
have
drunk
a
of
wine
or
a
cask
of
rhaki
vasile
admitted
to
his
share
of
these
luxuries
began
the
repast
with
touching
humility
he
kept
three
feet
from
the
table
like
a
peasant
invited
to
his
master
house
little
by
little
the
wine
lessened
the
distance
at
eight
my
guardian
explained
his
character
to
me
at
nine
stutteringly
related
to
me
the
adventures
of
his
youth
and
a
series
of
exploits
which
would
have
made
a
criminal
examining
magistrate
hair
stand
on
end
at
ten
he
became
philanthropic
this
heart
of
tempered
steel
was
dissolving
in
the
rhaki
like
cleopatra
pearl
in
the
vinegar
he
swore
to
me
that
he
became
a
bandit
because
of
his
love
for
humanity
that
he
would
make
his
fortune
in
ten
years
would
found
a
hospital
with
his
savings
and
then
retire
to
a
monastery
on
mount
athos
he
promised
that
he
would
not
forget
me
in
his
prayers
i
took
advantage
of
his
good
intentions
in
order
to
make
him
drink
an
enormous
cup
of
rhaki
i
might
have
offered
him
boiling
pitch
he
was
too
much
my
friend
to
refuse
me
soon
he
lost
his
voice
his
head
swung
from
the
right
to
the
left
from
the
left
to
the
right
with
the
regularity
of
a
pendulum
he
held
out
his
hand
to
me
it
alighted
on
the
remains
of
the
roast
this
he
shook
cordially
fell
over
on
his
back
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
egyptian
sphinx
which
the
french
cannons
have
never
awakened
i
had
not
an
instant
to
lose
the
minutes
were
golden
i
took
his
pistol
which
i
threw
to
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
i
seized
his
dagger
and
was
going
to
throw
that
down
also
when
the
thought
came
to
me
that
it
would
be
useful
in
cutting
up
the
turf
my
watch
showed
eleven
i
extinguished
the
two
torches
of
resinous
wood
which
had
lighted
our
table
the
light
might
attract
the
king
attention
it
was
a
beautiful
night
no
moon
at
all
but
the
sky
was
studded
with
stars
it
was
just
the
kind
of
night
for
my
purpose
the
turf
cut
in
long
strips
came
up
like
cloth
i
had
a
sufficient
quantity
at
the
end
of
an
hour
as
i
carried
them
to
the
spring
i
stumbled
against
vasile
he
raised
himself
heavily
and
through
habit
asked
me
if
i
needed
anything
i
let
fall
my
burden
and
seated
myself
near
the
drunken
man
and
begged
him
to
drink
one
more
cup
to
my
health
yes
he
mumbled
i
am
thirsty
i
filled
for
him
the
copper
cup
for
the
last
time
he
drank
half
of
it
spilled
the
remainder
over
his
face
and
neck
attempted
to
get
up
fell
over
on
his
face
with
his
arms
extended
and
moved
no
more
i
ran
to
my
dike
and
novice
as
i
was
the
brook
was
solidly
dammed
up
in
minutes
it
was
a
quarter
of
one
to
the
noise
of
the
cascade
succeeded
a
profound
silence
fear
seized
me
i
reflected
that
the
king
probably
slept
lightly
like
most
old
people
and
that
the
unusual
silence
would
probably
awake
him
in
the
tumult
of
thoughts
which
filled
my
mind
i
remembered
a
scene
in
the
barbier
de
seville
where
bartholo
was
awakened
when
he
ceased
to
hear
a
piano
i
glided
under
the
trees
to
the
staircase
and
looked
toward
the
cabinet
he
was
sleeping
peacefully
beside
his
i
crept
stealthily
along
within
twenty
feet
of
his
tree
i
listened
all
were
asleep
i
went
back
to
my
dam
passing
through
a
puddle
of
icy
water
which
was
already
up
to
my
ankles
flung
myself
down
and
looked
over
the
abyss
the
side
of
the
mountain
had
gradually
become
polished
there
were
here
and
there
cavities
in
which
water
had
formed
in
pools
i
had
taken
accurate
note
these
places
were
where
i
could
put
my
feet
i
returned
to
my
tent
took
my
box
which
was
suspended
over
my
bed
and
slung
it
over
my
shoulders
in
passing
the
place
where
we
had
dined
i
picked
up
a
part
of
a
loaf
and
a
piece
of
meat
which
the
water
had
not
yet
wet
i
put
these
provisions
in
my
box
for
my
breakfast
next
morning
the
dam
still
held
well
the
wind
ought
to
have
dried
my
path
it
was
nearly
two
i
wished
in
case
of
an
encounter
with
any
one
to
take
vasile
dagger
but
it
was
under
the
water
and
i
could
lose
no
time
searching
for
it
i
took
off
my
shoes
i
tied
them
together
and
hung
them
on
the
strap
of
my
box
at
last
after
thinking
of
everything
throwing
a
last
look
at
my
earthworks
giving
a
thought
to
my
family
at
home
and
sending
a
kiss
in
the
direction
of
athens
and
i
threw
one
leg
over
the
edge
i
seized
with
both
hands
a
tree
which
hung
over
the
abyss
and
i
started
out
trusting
to
god
to
help
me
it
was
rough
work
harder
than
i
had
supposed
when
looking
down
the
rock
not
entirely
dry
gave
me
a
feeling
of
clammy
cold
like
the
contact
of
a
serpent
i
had
not
calculated
distances
accurately
and
the
points
of
support
were
farther
apart
than
i
had
hoped
twice
i
took
a
wrong
course
in
moving
to
the
left
i
had
to
return
a
work
of
incredible
difficulty
hope
abandoned
me
often
but
not
my
will
my
foot
slipped
i
mistook
a
shadow
for
a
projection
and
i
fell
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
clinging
with
my
hands
and
body
to
the
side
of
the
mountain
without
finding
a
place
to
stop
myself
a
root
of
a
caught
me
by
the
cuff
of
my
you
can
see
the
marks
here
a
little
further
on
a
bird
hidden
in
a
little
hole
on
the
mountain
side
flew
out
between
my
legs
so
suddenly
and
frightened
me
so
that
i
almost
fell
head
first
i
advanced
with
feet
and
hands
especially
with
my
hands
my
arms
seemed
broken
and
i
heard
the
tendons
creak
like
the
cords
of
a
harp
my
nails
were
so
cruelly
torn
that
they
ceased
to
pain
me
perhaps
if
i
had
been
able
to
measure
the
distance
still
before
me
i
would
have
felt
renewed
strength
but
when
i
turned
my
head
i
became
so
dizzy
that
i
abandoned
the
attempt
to
sustain
my
courage
i
talked
to
myself
i
spoke
out
loud
between
my
clenched
teeth
i
said
one
more
step
for
my
father
yet
another
for
still
one
more
for
the
confusion
of
the
brigands
and
the
rage
of
my
feet
at
last
rested
on
a
broad
ledge
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
soil
had
changed
color
i
bent
my
knees
i
seated
myself
i
turned
my
head
i
was
only
ten
feet
from
the
brook
i
had
reached
the
red
rocks
the
smooth
stone
full
of
hollows
in
which
the
water
still
stood
allowed
me
to
take
breath
and
rest
a
little
i
drew
out
my
watch
it
was
only
half
past
two
i
would
have
believed
that
my
journey
had
taken
three
nights
i
examined
my
arms
and
legs
to
ascertain
if
i
still
possessed
them
all
in
this
kind
of
an
expedition
one
never
knows
what
will
happen
i
had
had
good
luck
i
had
suffered
some
contusions
and
the
skin
was
rubbed
off
in
two
or
three
places
the
worst
sufferer
was
my
paletot
i
looked
up
not
to
thank
heaven
but
to
assure
myself
that
nothing
had
moved
in
my
camping
place
i
heard
only
the
drops
of
water
filtering
through
my
dam
all
was
well
i
was
reassured
i
knew
where
to
find
athens
adieu
to
the
king
of
the
mountains
i
was
about
to
leap
to
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
when
a
whitish
form
jumped
up
before
me
and
i
heard
the
most
furious
barking
which
had
ever
awakened
morning
echoes
alas
monsieur
the
enemies
of
man
roamed
at
all
hours
around
the
camp
and
one
of
them
had
scented
me
i
can
not
describe
the
fury
and
hate
which
possessed
me
at
meeting
him
one
does
not
detest
to
this
degree
an
irrational
being
i
would
have
much
preferred
to
find
myself
face
to
face
with
a
wolf
with
a
tiger
or
a
white
bear
noble
beasts
who
would
have
eaten
me
without
saying
anything
but
who
would
not
have
denounced
me
ferocious
beasts
hunt
for
themselves
but
to
think
of
this
horrible
dog
who
was
about
to
devour
me
with
a
great
uproar
in
order
to
serve
i
overwhelmed
him
with
insults
i
hurled
the
most
odious
names
at
him
do
the
best
i
could
yet
he
spoke
louder
than
i
changed
my
tune
i
tried
the
effect
of
kind
words
i
spoke
to
him
sweetly
in
greek
in
the
tongue
of
his
fathers
he
gave
but
one
response
to
all
my
advances
and
the
response
awoke
the
mountain
echoes
a
thought
struck
me
i
was
silent
he
ceased
barking
i
stretched
myself
out
among
the
pools
of
water
he
crouched
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
with
low
growls
i
pretended
to
sleep
he
slept
i
glided
inch
by
inch
toward
the
brook
he
was
up
with
a
bound
and
i
had
only
time
to
regain
my
platform
my
hat
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
or
rather
in
the
teeth
of
the
enemy
an
instant
afterward
it
was
no
more
than
a
pulp
a
chewed
up
mass
a
rag
of
a
hat
poor
hat
i
pitied
it
i
put
myself
in
its
place
if
i
could
have
escaped
less
a
few
mouthfuls
i
would
not
have
considered
the
matter
a
great
while
i
would
have
made
allowances
for
the
dog
share
but
these
monsters
are
not
satisfied
with
killing
people
they
eat
them
i
was
convinced
that
he
was
hungry
that
if
i
could
find
enough
to
surfeit
him
he
might
possibly
bite
me
but
he
would
not
devour
me
i
had
some
provisions
i
would
sacrifice
them
my
only
regret
was
that
i
did
not
have
a
hundred
times
more
i
threw
a
piece
of
bread
to
him
he
swallowed
it
in
one
mouthful
imagine
a
pebble
which
falls
into
a
well
as
i
looked
piteously
at
the
small
portion
which
still
remained
i
saw
in
the
bottom
of
the
box
a
white
package
which
gave
me
a
new
idea
it
was
a
small
amount
of
arsenic
used
in
my
zoological
preparations
i
used
it
in
stuffing
birds
but
no
law
prevented
me
from
putting
a
few
grains
into
the
body
of
a
dog
my
speaker
with
sharpened
appetite
demanded
more
wait
i
said
to
him
i
am
going
to
give
thee
a
morsel
of
my
own
making
the
package
contained
about
grammes
of
a
pretty
powder
white
and
shining
i
turned
five
or
six
into
a
small
pool
of
water
and
i
put
the
remainder
in
my
pocket
i
carefully
diluted
a
portion
for
the
animal
i
waited
until
the
acid
was
well
dissolved
i
dipped
into
the
solution
a
piece
of
bread
which
soaked
it
all
up
like
a
sponge
the
dog
sprang
upon
it
with
a
good
appetite
and
swallowed
it
at
once
why
was
not
i
provided
with
a
little
strychnine
or
some
other
good
poison
more
fearful
than
arsenic
it
was
after
three
and
the
results
of
my
experiment
were
not
instantaneous
about
half
after
three
the
dog
began
to
howl
with
all
his
strength
i
had
not
gained
much
barking
and
howling
cries
of
fury
or
of
agony
were
all
to
the
same
purpose
that
is
the
awakening
of
soon
the
animal
fell
into
frightful
convulsions
he
foamed
at
the
mouth
he
was
seized
with
nausea
he
made
violent
effort
to
throw
off
the
poison
it
was
a
sweet
sight
to
me
and
i
enjoyed
it
the
death
of
the
enemy
was
my
only
way
of
escape
and
death
was
vanquishing
him
i
hoped
that
conquered
by
the
poison
he
would
permit
me
to
leave
but
he
raged
against
me
he
opened
his
and
bloody
jaws
as
if
to
reproach
me
with
my
presents
and
to
tell
me
that
he
would
not
die
without
vengeance
i
threw
my
handkerchief
to
him
he
tore
it
as
savagely
as
my
hat
the
sky
began
to
lighten
i
became
convinced
that
i
had
committed
a
useless
murder
an
hour
later
the
brigands
would
be
upon
me
i
looked
up
to
that
horrid
place
which
i
had
left
without
expecting
to
return
to
it
and
to
which
the
dog
endurance
was
forcing
me
a
volume
of
water
suddenly
poured
over
the
rock
and
threw
me
face
down
the
icy
water
filled
with
huge
pieces
of
turf
stones
fragments
of
rock
rolled
over
me
the
dam
had
broken
and
the
whole
body
of
water
poured
over
my
head
a
trembling
seized
me
i
became
chilled
my
blood
congealed
i
looked
toward
the
dog
he
was
still
at
the
foot
of
my
rock
struggling
with
death
with
the
current
with
anything
jaws
open
and
eyes
turned
towards
me
this
must
end
i
took
off
my
box
clutched
it
by
the
straps
and
pounded
that
hideous
head
with
such
fury
that
the
enemy
left
me
the
field
of
battle
the
torrent
seized
him
rolled
him
over
two
or
three
times
and
carried
him
i
know
not
where
i
jumped
into
the
water
it
was
up
to
my
waist
i
clung
to
the
rocks
i
went
with
the
current
i
was
over
the
bank
i
shook
myself
i
cried
hurrah
for
four
brigands
rose
out
of
the
earth
they
caught
me
by
the
collar
saying
here
thou
art
assassin
come
we
will
take
thee
back
the
king
will
be
happy
vasile
will
be
avenged
it
appeared
that
without
knowing
it
i
had
drowned
my
friend
vasile
at
that
time
monsieur
i
had
never
killed
a
man
vasile
was
my
first
i
have
fought
others
since
to
defend
myself
and
to
save
my
life
but
vasile
is
the
only
one
who
has
caused
me
any
remorse
although
his
end
was
probably
the
result
of
a
very
innocent
imprudence
you
know
that
it
is
only
the
first
step
no
murderer
discovered
by
the
police
surrounded
with
soldiers
and
led
to
the
scene
of
his
crime
hung
his
head
more
humbly
than
i
dared
not
raise
my
eyes
to
the
good
people
who
had
arrested
me
i
did
not
feel
equal
to
encountering
the
eyes
of
these
reprobates
i
trembled
i
presented
a
guilty
appearance
i
knew
that
i
must
appear
before
my
judge
and
be
placed
before
my
victim
how
could
i
confront
the
king
frown
after
what
i
had
done
how
could
i
see
without
dying
of
shame
the
inanimate
body
of
the
unfortunate
vasile
my
knees
shook
i
would
have
fallen
but
for
the
kicks
i
received
from
those
following
me
i
crossed
the
deserted
camp
the
king
cabinet
occupied
by
some
of
the
wounded
and
i
descended
or
rather
i
fell
to
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
to
my
chamber
the
waters
had
receded
leaving
traces
of
mud
everywhere
a
small
pool
of
water
still
remained
where
i
had
raised
the
dam
the
bandits
the
king
and
the
monk
stood
in
a
circle
about
a
dark
and
muddy
object
the
sight
of
which
made
my
hair
stand
on
end
it
was
vasile
heaven
preserve
you
monsieur
from
the
sight
of
a
corpse
of
your
own
making
the
water
and
the
mud
rushing
over
him
had
deposited
on
him
a
hideous
layer
have
you
ever
seen
a
great
fly
which
had
been
caught
three
or
four
days
before
in
a
large
the
artisan
of
the
web
not
being
able
to
rid
himself
of
his
visitor
had
enveloped
him
in
a
tangle
of
gray
threads
and
changed
him
to
an
unformed
and
unrecognizable
mass
such
was
vasile
a
few
hours
after
he
had
dined
with
me
i
found
him
ten
feet
from
the
path
where
i
had
bidden
him
farewell
i
do
not
know
whether
the
brigands
had
laid
him
there
or
whether
he
had
thrown
himself
there
in
his
convulsions
of
agony
i
am
inclined
to
believe
however
that
death
had
come
to
him
gently
full
of
wine
as
i
had
left
him
he
must
have
succumbed
without
a
struggle
to
some
cerebral
congestion
a
menacing
murmur
which
was
a
bad
augury
greeted
my
arrival
with
pale
and
contracted
brow
walked
up
to
me
seized
me
by
the
left
wrist
and
dragged
me
so
violently
that
he
dislocated
my
arm
he
threw
me
into
the
middle
of
the
circle
with
such
force
that
i
almost
fell
on
my
victim
i
instantly
recoiled
look
he
cried
in
thundering
tones
look
at
what
you
have
done
rejoice
in
your
work
gaze
upon
your
crime
wretch
but
where
would
you
have
stopped
who
would
have
said
the
day
i
received
you
here
that
i
had
opened
my
door
to
an
assassin
i
stammered
some
excuses
i
tried
to
show
the
judge
that
i
was
guilty
only
of
imprudence
i
warmly
accused
myself
of
having
intoxicated
my
guardian
in
order
to
escape
his
watchfulness
and
to
flee
without
hindrance
from
my
prison
but
i
defended
myself
from
the
crime
of
assassinating
him
was
it
my
fault
if
the
rise
of
waters
drowned
him
an
hour
after
my
departure
the
proof
that
i
had
wished
him
no
evil
was
that
i
had
not
stabbed
him
when
he
was
dead
drunk
and
that
i
had
his
weapons
at
hand
they
could
wash
the
body
and
see
that
he
was
not
wounded
at
least
the
king
replied
confess
that
your
act
was
very
selfish
and
very
culpable
when
your
life
was
not
threatened
when
you
were
held
here
for
only
a
small
sum
you
fled
through
avarice
you
thought
only
of
saving
a
few
écus
and
you
did
not
trouble
yourself
about
this
poor
unfortunate
whom
you
left
to
die
you
never
thought
of
me
that
you
were
going
to
deprive
me
of
a
valuable
officer
and
what
moment
did
you
choose
to
betray
us
the
day
on
which
all
kinds
of
troubles
assailed
us
when
i
had
sustained
a
defeat
when
i
had
lost
my
best
soldiers
when
sophocles
was
wounded
when
the
corfuan
was
dying
when
the
little
spiro
upon
whom
i
relied
was
killed
when
all
my
men
were
weary
and
discouraged
it
was
then
you
had
the
heart
to
relieve
me
of
vasile
have
you
then
no
humane
sentiments
would
it
not
have
been
a
hundred
times
better
to
have
paid
your
ransom
honestly
as
became
a
good
prisoner
than
to
have
it
said
you
sacrificed
a
life
for
francs
eh
zounds
you
have
killed
people
and
for
less
he
replied
with
dignity
that
is
my
business
it
is
not
yours
i
am
a
brigand
and
you
are
a
doctor
i
am
greek
and
you
are
german
to
that
i
had
nothing
to
reply
i
felt
convinced
from
the
trembling
of
every
fiber
of
my
heart
that
i
had
neither
been
born
nor
brought
up
to
the
profession
of
killing
men
the
king
angry
at
my
silence
raised
his
voice
and
said
do
you
know
miserable
young
man
who
was
the
excellent
man
of
whose
death
you
are
guilty
he
was
a
descendant
of
those
heroic
brigands
of
souli
who
fought
fierce
battles
for
their
religion
and
against
ali
de
tebelen
pasha
of
janina
for
four
generations
all
of
his
ancestors
have
either
been
hung
or
decapitated
not
one
has
died
in
his
bed
only
six
years
ago
his
own
brother
perished
in
epirus
having
been
condemned
to
death
he
had
killed
a
mohammedan
devotion
and
courage
are
hereditary
in
that
family
never
did
vasile
forget
his
religious
duties
he
gave
to
the
churches
he
gave
to
the
poor
at
easter
he
always
lighted
a
larger
taper
than
any
one
else
he
would
have
killed
himself
rather
than
violate
the
law
of
abstinence
or
eat
meat
on
a
he
economized
in
order
to
retire
to
a
convent
on
mount
athos
did
you
know
it
i
humbly
confessed
that
i
did
know
it
do
you
know
that
he
was
the
most
steadfast
of
all
my
band
i
do
not
wish
to
detract
from
the
personal
merit
of
those
who
are
listening
to
me
but
vasile
possessed
a
blind
devotion
a
fearless
obedience
a
true
zeal
under
all
circumstances
no
labor
was
too
great
for
his
courage
no
occupation
too
repugnant
for
his
fidelity
he
would
have
killed
every
one
in
the
kingdom
if
i
had
ordered
him
to
do
so
he
would
have
torn
out
his
best
friend
eye
if
i
had
given
him
a
sign
with
my
little
finger
and
you
have
killed
him
poor
vasile
when
i
shall
have
a
village
to
burn
a
miser
to
torture
a
woman
to
cut
in
pieces
an
infant
to
burn
alive
who
will
replace
thee
all
the
brigands
electrified
by
this
funeral
oration
cried
in
one
voice
we
we
some
held
out
their
arms
to
the
king
others
unsheathed
their
daggers
the
most
zealous
leveled
their
pistols
at
me
checked
their
enthusiasm
he
stepped
in
front
of
me
to
shield
me
and
went
on
with
his
discourse
in
these
words
be
consoled
vasile
thou
shalt
not
rest
without
vengeance
if
i
listened
only
to
my
grief
i
would
offer
to
thy
manes
thy
head
but
it
is
worth
francs
and
that
thought
restrains
me
thou
thyself
if
thou
couldst
speak
as
formerly
in
our
councils
thou
wouldst
beg
me
to
spare
him
thou
wouldst
refuse
so
costly
a
vengeance
it
is
not
proper
in
the
circumstances
in
which
thy
death
has
left
us
to
do
foolish
things
and
to
throw
money
away
he
stopped
a
moment
i
drew
a
deep
breath
but
the
king
went
on
i
will
know
how
to
reconcile
interest
with
justice
i
will
chastise
the
guilty
one
without
risking
the
capital
his
punishment
shall
be
the
most
beautiful
ornament
of
funeral
obsequies
and
from
above
from
the
homes
of
the
palikars
to
which
thy
spirit
has
gone
thou
shalt
contemplate
with
joy
an
expiatory
punishment
which
shall
not
cost
us
a
sou
this
peroration
aroused
the
audience
i
was
the
only
one
not
charmed
i
puzzled
my
brain
trying
to
imagine
what
the
king
had
in
store
for
me
and
i
felt
so
little
assured
that
my
teeth
chattered
surely
i
ought
to
esteem
myself
happy
to
save
my
life
and
the
preservation
of
my
head
seemed
no
mean
advantage
but
i
knew
the
inventive
imagination
of
these
greeks
of
the
highway
without
putting
me
to
death
could
inflict
such
chastisement
as
would
make
me
hate
life
the
old
rascal
refused
to
inform
me
as
to
what
punishment
he
had
in
store
for
me
he
pitied
my
agony
so
little
that
he
compelled
me
to
assist
in
the
funeral
ceremonies
of
his
lieutenant
the
body
was
stripped
of
its
garments
carried
to
the
brook
and
bathed
vasile
features
were
changed
but
little
his
mouth
still
bore
the
silly
smile
of
the
drunkard
his
open
eyes
preserved
a
stupid
look
his
limbs
had
not
lost
their
suppleness
the
rigor
mortis
does
not
come
for
a
long
time
to
those
who
die
by
accident
the
king
and
proceeded
to
dress
the
dead
the
king
bore
the
expenses
as
heir
vasile
had
no
relatives
and
all
his
property
reverted
to
the
king
they
clothed
the
body
in
a
fine
shirt
a
shirt
of
beautiful
percale
and
a
vest
embroidered
with
silver
they
covered
his
wet
locks
with
a
bonnet
which
was
nearly
new
they
put
leggins
of
red
silk
on
the
legs
which
would
never
run
again
slippers
of
russia
leather
were
slipped
on
his
feet
in
all
his
life
poor
vasile
had
never
been
so
clean
nor
so
gorgeous
they
touched
his
lips
with
carmine
they
whitened
and
rouged
his
face
as
if
he
was
a
young
actor
about
to
step
on
the
stage
during
the
whole
operation
the
bandit
orchestra
executed
a
lugubrious
air
which
you
must
have
heard
in
the
streets
of
athens
i
congratulate
myself
that
i
did
not
die
in
greece
because
the
music
is
abominable
and
i
never
could
have
consoled
myself
if
i
had
been
buried
to
that
air
four
brigands
began
to
dig
a
grave
in
the
middle
of
the
chamber
upon
the
place
where
simons
tent
stood
and
on
the
spot
where
had
slept
two
others
ran
to
the
to
find
which
they
distributed
i
was
given
one
with
all
the
others
the
monk
intoned
the
service
for
the
dead
made
the
responses
in
firm
tones
which
went
to
the
depths
of
my
soul
there
was
a
light
breeze
and
the
wax
from
my
taper
fell
upon
my
hand
in
a
burning
shower
but
that
alas
was
a
small
thing
in
comparison
with
what
awaited
me
i
would
have
willingly
endured
that
trouble
if
the
ceremony
could
never
have
been
finished
it
was
finished
at
last
when
the
last
oration
had
been
delivered
the
king
solemnly
approached
the
bier
on
which
the
body
lay
and
kissed
vasile
lips
the
bandits
one
by
one
followed
his
example
i
shivered
at
the
thought
that
my
turn
was
coming
i
tried
to
hide
behind
two
who
had
already
performed
their
duty
but
they
saw
me
and
said
it
is
your
turn
start
then
you
certainly
owe
him
that
was
this
at
last
the
expiation
which
awaited
me
a
just
man
would
have
been
satisfied
at
least
i
swear
to
you
monsieur
that
it
is
no
child
play
to
kiss
the
lips
of
a
corpse
above
all
when
one
can
reproach
one
self
with
being
the
instrument
of
his
death
i
walked
toward
the
bier
i
looked
at
the
face
whose
eyes
seemed
to
laugh
at
my
embarrassment
i
bent
my
head
i
slightly
touched
the
lips
a
humorous
brigand
applied
his
hand
to
the
nape
of
my
neck
my
mouth
struck
the
cold
lips
i
felt
the
icy
teeth
and
seized
with
horror
i
raised
my
head
carrying
away
with
me
i
know
not
what
terror
of
death
which
seizes
me
at
this
moment
women
are
very
fortunate
they
have
the
resource
of
fainting
they
then
lowered
the
body
into
the
earth
they
threw
in
a
handful
of
flowers
a
loaf
of
bread
an
apple
and
a
little
wine
this
latter
was
the
thing
of
which
he
had
the
least
need
the
grave
was
quickly
filled
more
quickly
than
i
wished
a
brigand
observed
that
they
must
get
two
sticks
for
a
cross
replied
be
quiet
we
will
put
up
milord
sticks
i
leave
it
to
you
to
think
whether
my
heart
beat
tumultuously
what
sticks
what
was
there
in
common
between
sticks
and
me
the
king
made
a
sign
to
his
who
ran
to
the
office
and
came
back
with
two
long
laurel
poles
took
the
funeral
bier
and
laid
it
upon
the
grave
he
pressed
it
down
hard
into
the
freshly
turned
earth
and
he
raised
it
up
at
one
end
while
the
other
lay
in
the
soil
and
he
smilingly
said
to
me
it
is
for
you
that
i
am
working
take
off
your
shoes
if
you
please
he
must
have
read
in
my
eyes
a
question
full
of
agony
and
terror
for
he
replied
to
the
demand
which
i
dared
not
address
to
him
i
am
not
wicked
and
i
have
always
detested
useless
severity
that
is
why
i
wish
to
inflict
on
you
a
chastisement
which
will
be
of
use
to
us
inasmuch
as
it
will
dispense
with
any
future
watchfulness
over
you
you
have
had
for
several
days
a
craze
to
escape
i
hope
that
when
you
have
received
twenty
blows
of
the
stick
upon
the
soles
of
your
feet
you
will
no
longer
need
to
be
watched
and
your
love
for
traveling
will
cease
for
some
time
i
know
what
the
punishment
is
the
turks
treated
me
to
a
dose
of
it
in
my
youth
and
i
know
by
experience
that
one
does
not
die
of
it
one
suffers
much
from
it
you
will
cry
out
i
warn
you
of
it
vasile
will
hear
from
the
depths
of
his
tomb
and
he
will
be
pleased
with
us
at
this
announcement
my
first
thought
was
to
use
my
legs
while
i
still
had
the
freedom
to
do
so
but
you
must
believe
that
my
will
was
very
weak
for
it
was
impossible
to
put
one
foot
before
the
other
raised
me
from
the
ground
as
lightly
as
we
pick
up
an
insect
in
our
path
i
felt
myself
bound
down
and
unshod
before
a
thought
leaving
my
brain
had
time
to
act
upon
any
of
my
members
i
knew
neither
upon
what
they
supported
my
feet
nor
how
they
kept
them
from
falling
at
the
first
stroke
of
the
stick
i
saw
the
two
sticks
lifted
in
the
air
the
one
to
the
right
the
other
to
the
left
i
closed
my
eyes
and
waited
i
certainly
did
not
wait
the
tenth
part
of
a
second
and
yet
so
short
a
time
was
sufficient
to
send
a
tender
thought
to
my
father
a
kiss
to
and
more
than
a
hundred
imprecations
to
be
divided
between
simons
and
john
harris
i
did
not
become
unconscious
for
an
instant
it
is
a
weakness
which
i
never
possessed
i
have
told
you
so
there
was
also
nothing
to
lose
the
first
blow
was
so
terrific
that
i
believed
that
those
which
followed
could
amount
to
little
it
took
me
in
the
middle
of
the
soles
under
that
small
elastic
arch
just
in
front
of
the
heel
which
supports
the
body
it
was
not
the
foot
that
hurt
me
most
that
time
but
i
believed
that
the
bones
of
my
poor
legs
were
breaking
in
pieces
the
second
blow
struck
lower
just
under
the
heels
it
gave
me
a
shock
profound
violent
which
made
my
whole
vertebral
column
quiver
and
filled
my
brain
with
a
frightful
tumult
that
almost
split
my
cranium
the
third
was
given
directly
on
the
toes
and
produced
an
acute
and
stinging
sensation
which
shot
all
over
my
body
and
made
me
believe
for
an
instant
that
the
stick
had
hit
me
on
the
end
of
the
nose
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
blood
flowed
for
the
first
time
the
blows
succeeded
each
other
in
the
same
order
and
in
the
same
places
at
equal
intervals
i
had
enough
courage
to
keep
silent
during
the
first
two
i
cried
out
at
the
third
i
howled
at
the
fourth
i
groaned
at
the
fifth
and
those
which
followed
at
the
tenth
the
flesh
itself
could
suffer
no
more
i
was
silent
but
the
prostration
of
my
physical
force
diminished
in
no
wise
the
clearness
of
my
perceptions
i
could
not
have
raised
my
eyelids
and
yet
the
lightest
sounds
reached
my
ears
i
lost
no
word
of
what
was
said
around
me
it
was
an
observation
which
i
shall
remember
later
if
i
practice
medicine
doctors
do
not
hesitate
to
condemn
a
sick
man
four
feet
from
his
bed
without
thinking
that
perhaps
the
poor
devil
can
hear
them
i
heard
a
young
brigand
say
to
the
king
he
is
dead
what
good
to
weary
two
men
without
profit
to
any
one
replied
fear
nothing
i
received
sixty
one
after
another
and
two
days
afterward
i
danced
the
romanique
how
didst
thou
do
that
i
used
the
pomade
of
the
italian
renegade
where
were
we
how
many
blows
seventeen
three
more
my
children
and
lay
on
the
last
ones
hard
the
stick
had
done
its
work
well
the
last
blows
fell
upon
a
bloody
but
insentient
mass
of
flesh
pain
had
nearly
paralyzed
me
they
raised
me
from
the
stretcher
they
unbound
the
cords
they
swathed
my
feet
with
compresses
dipped
in
fresh
water
and
as
i
had
the
thirst
of
the
wounded
they
gave
me
a
large
cup
of
wine
anger
returned
with
my
strength
i
do
not
know
whether
you
have
ever
been
bastinadoed
but
i
know
nothing
more
humiliating
than
physical
chastisement
in
order
to
become
the
sovereign
of
the
whole
world
i
would
not
for
an
instant
be
the
slave
of
a
vile
stick
born
in
the
nineteenth
century
understanding
the
use
of
steam
and
electricity
possessing
a
good
share
of
the
secrets
of
nature
knowing
thoroughly
all
that
science
has
invented
for
the
and
security
of
man
knowing
also
how
to
cure
fevers
how
to
prevent
taking
and
then
not
to
be
able
to
defend
one
self
against
a
blow
from
a
stick
it
is
a
little
too
much
surely
if
i
had
been
a
soldier
and
had
submitted
to
corporal
punishment
i
should
certainly
have
killed
my
chiefs
when
i
felt
myself
seated
on
the
slimy
ground
my
feet
paralyzed
with
pain
my
hand
useless
when
i
saw
around
me
the
men
who
had
beaten
me
the
ones
who
had
struck
me
and
those
who
had
seen
me
punished
anger
shame
a
feeling
of
outraged
dignity
of
justice
violated
of
intelligence
brutalized
swept
through
my
enfeebled
body
in
a
wave
of
hate
of
revolt
and
of
vengeance
i
forgot
everything
prudence
interest
discretion
the
future
and
i
gave
free
vent
to
the
thoughts
which
stifled
me
a
torrent
of
abuse
poured
from
my
lips
while
an
overflow
of
bile
mounted
to
my
eyes
surely
i
am
no
orator
and
my
solitary
studies
have
given
me
no
exercise
in
the
use
of
words
but
indignation
which
has
made
some
poets
lent
me
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
savage
eloquence
of
those
prisoners
who
rendered
up
their
souls
with
insults
and
who
breathed
their
last
sighs
in
the
face
of
the
roman
conquerors
everything
which
can
outrage
a
man
in
his
pride
in
his
affections
and
in
his
dearest
sentiments
i
said
to
the
king
of
the
mountains
i
put
him
in
the
rank
with
unclean
animals
and
i
denied
him
even
the
name
of
man
i
insulted
him
through
his
mother
his
wife
his
daughter
and
all
of
his
posterity
i
would
like
to
repeat
to
you
verbatim
all
that
i
made
him
listen
to
but
words
are
wanting
as
i
am
not
angry
i
invented
terms
which
are
not
found
in
the
dictionary
but
which
were
understood
however
for
the
audience
of
outcasts
howled
under
my
words
like
a
pack
of
hounds
under
the
lash
of
but
although
i
kept
watch
of
the
old
palikar
eagerly
scanning
the
muscles
of
his
face
and
searching
for
the
slightest
trace
of
a
frown
i
could
discern
not
the
slightest
sign
of
emotion
face
was
like
that
of
a
marble
statue
he
replied
to
all
insults
with
a
contemptuous
silence
his
attitude
exasperated
me
to
madness
i
was
certainly
insane
for
a
moment
a
red
cloud
like
blood
passed
before
my
eyes
i
rose
suddenly
on
my
wounded
feet
i
saw
a
pistol
thrust
in
the
of
one
of
the
brigands
i
pulled
it
out
i
aimed
it
at
the
king
i
drew
the
trigger
and
fell
back
murmuring
i
am
avenged
it
was
the
king
himself
who
raised
me
i
looked
at
him
with
an
astonishment
as
great
as
if
i
had
seen
him
walking
out
of
hell
he
seemed
not
at
all
moved
and
smiled
as
tranquilly
as
an
immortal
and
moreover
monsieur
i
had
not
missed
him
my
ball
had
touched
his
forehead
a
little
above
the
left
eyebrow
a
trace
of
blood
testified
to
it
possibly
the
pistol
was
badly
loaded
or
the
powder
poor
or
it
may
be
that
the
ball
had
glanced
across
the
bone
but
whatever
it
was
my
bullet
had
made
only
an
abrasion
the
invulnerable
monster
seated
me
carefully
on
the
ground
leaned
toward
me
pulled
my
ear
and
said
why
do
you
attempt
the
impossible
young
man
i
warned
you
that
i
had
a
head
that
was
and
you
know
that
i
never
lie
were
you
not
told
that
ibrahim
had
seven
egyptians
shoot
at
me
and
that
he
was
unsuccessful
i
hope
that
you
do
not
pretend
to
be
more
powerful
than
seven
egyptians
but
do
you
know
that
you
have
a
nimble
hand
for
a
northern
man
peste
if
my
mother
of
whom
you
spoke
lightly
a
few
moments
ago
had
not
endowed
me
with
strength
i
would
now
be
a
dead
man
another
in
my
place
would
have
died
without
having
time
to
say
you
as
for
me
such
things
rejuvenate
me
it
recalls
my
best
days
at
your
age
i
exposed
my
life
four
times
a
day
and
i
only
digested
the
better
for
it
come
i
will
pardon
you
your
hasty
action
but
as
all
my
subjects
are
not
proof
against
bullets
and
that
you
may
commit
no
new
imprudence
i
shall
apply
to
your
hands
the
same
treatment
as
your
feet
received
nothing
prevents
us
from
punishing
you
immediately
i
will
wait
however
until
in
the
interests
of
your
health
you
see
the
stick
is
a
blunt
weapon
which
kills
no
one
you
have
yourself
proved
that
one
bastinadoed
man
is
worth
two
ceremony
will
occupy
you
prisoners
do
not
know
how
to
pass
the
time
it
was
idleness
which
gave
you
bad
counsels
rest
easy
moreover
as
soon
as
your
ransom
arrives
i
will
cure
your
wounds
i
still
have
some
of
balm
there
will
be
no
signs
of
them
at
the
end
of
two
days
and
you
can
dance
at
the
ball
at
the
palace
without
telling
your
partners
that
they
are
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
cavalier
who
has
been
beaten
i
am
not
a
greek
and
the
insults
wounded
me
as
grievously
as
the
blows
i
shook
my
fist
in
the
old
rascal
face
and
cried
out
with
all
my
strength
no
wretch
my
ransom
will
never
be
paid
no
i
have
not
asked
anyone
for
the
money
thou
wilt
get
from
me
only
my
head
which
will
serve
thee
nothing
take
it
quickly
if
it
seems
good
to
thee
it
will
do
me
a
favor
and
thyself
also
thou
wilt
spare
me
two
weeks
of
torture
and
the
disgust
of
looking
at
thee
which
is
the
most
of
all
thou
wilt
save
my
board
for
fifteen
days
do
not
miss
it
it
is
the
only
benefit
that
thou
wilt
reap
from
me
he
smiled
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
replied
ta
ta
ta
ta
thus
it
is
with
young
people
extremists
in
everything
they
throw
the
helve
after
the
hatchet
if
i
listened
to
you
i
would
regret
it
before
eight
hours
had
passed
and
so
would
you
the
englishwomen
will
pay
i
am
sure
of
it
i
know
women
yet
although
i
have
lived
in
retirement
for
a
long
time
what
would
be
said
if
i
killed
you
and
your
ransom
arrived
the
story
would
go
out
that
i
had
broken
my
word
and
my
prisoners
would
allow
themselves
to
be
killed
like
sheep
without
asking
a
centime
of
their
parents
it
would
spoil
the
trade
ah
thou
believest
that
the
englishwomen
will
pay
thee
my
clever
fellow
yes
they
will
pay
thee
as
thou
meritest
you
are
very
good
their
ransom
will
cost
thee
francs
dost
thou
hear
eighty
thousand
francs
out
of
thy
pocket
do
not
say
such
things
one
would
think
that
the
blows
of
the
stick
had
turned
your
brain
i
tell
thee
the
truth
dost
thou
recall
the
name
of
thy
prisoners
no
but
i
have
it
in
writing
i
will
jog
thy
memory
the
lady
called
herself
mrs
simons
well
partner
of
the
firm
of
barley
in
london
my
banker
precisely
how
doest
thou
know
my
banker
name
because
thou
didst
dictate
before
me
what
matter
after
all
they
can
not
escape
they
are
not
greeks
they
are
english
the
courts
i
will
make
complaint
and
thou
wouldst
lose
they
have
a
receipt
that
is
so
but
by
what
mischance
did
i
give
them
a
receipt
because
i
advised
thee
to
do
it
poor
man
wretch
dog
wrongly
baptized
heretic
of
hell
thou
hast
ruined
me
thou
hast
betrayed
me
thou
hast
robbed
me
eighty
thousand
francs
i
am
responsible
if
they
were
the
bankers
of
the
company
i
would
lose
only
my
share
but
they
hold
only
my
capital
i
shall
lose
it
all
art
thou
very
sure
that
she
is
a
partner
of
the
firm
of
barley
as
i
am
sure
of
dying
no
thou
shalt
not
die
till
thou
hast
not
suffered
enough
we
will
make
thee
pay
for
those
francs
what
punishment
can
we
invent
eighty
thousand
francs
eighty
thousand
deaths
would
be
little
what
have
i
done
to
this
traitor
who
has
robbed
me
peuh
child
play
a
pleasantry
he
has
not
howled
two
hours
i
must
invent
something
better
but
may
be
there
are
two
firms
of
the
same
name
cavendish
square
no
yes
it
is
the
same
fool
why
didst
thou
not
warn
me
instead
of
betraying
me
i
would
have
asked
double
the
sum
they
would
have
paid
it
they
have
the
means
i
would
not
have
given
the
receipt
i
will
never
give
another
no
no
it
is
the
last
time
received
a
hundred
thousand
francs
of
simons
what
a
foolish
sentence
was
it
really
i
who
dictated
that
but
i
reflect
now
i
did
not
sign
it
yes
but
my
seal
is
equal
to
a
signature
there
are
twenty
letters
in
my
name
why
didst
thou
demand
this
receipt
what
do
you
expect
from
those
ladies
fifteen
thousand
francs
for
thy
ransom
selfishness
everywhere
thou
shouldst
have
confided
in
me
i
would
have
let
thee
go
without
the
ransom
i
would
even
have
paid
thee
if
thou
art
poor
as
thou
sayest
thou
art
thou
shouldst
know
how
good
money
is
thou
thinkest
only
of
a
sum
of
francs
dost
thou
know
what
a
heap
that
would
make
in
a
room
how
many
pieces
of
gold
how
much
money
one
could
make
in
business
with
francs
it
is
a
calamity
thou
hast
robbed
me
of
a
fortune
thou
hast
robbed
my
daughter
the
only
being
i
love
in
the
world
it
is
for
her
that
i
work
but
if
thou
knowest
my
affairs
thou
knowest
that
i
scour
the
mountains
for
a
whole
year
to
gain
francs
thou
hast
plundered
me
of
two
years
income
it
is
as
if
i
had
slept
for
two
years
i
had
then
found
the
tender
chord
the
old
palikar
was
touched
to
the
heart
i
knew
that
there
was
a
heavy
score
against
me
and
i
expected
no
mercy
and
moreover
i
experienced
an
intense
joy
in
seeing
that
impassable
mask
torn
asunder
and
that
stony
face
wrung
with
emotion
i
rejoiced
to
see
in
his
wrinkled
face
the
convulsive
movements
of
passion
as
the
boat
lost
in
a
raging
sea
admires
afar
off
the
wave
which
is
to
engulf
it
i
was
like
the
thinking
reed
which
the
brutal
universe
crushes
into
a
shapeless
mass
and
which
consoles
itself
in
dying
with
the
lofty
thought
of
its
superiority
i
said
to
myself
with
pride
i
shall
die
by
torture
but
i
am
the
master
of
my
master
and
the
executioner
of
my
execution
vii
john
harris
the
king
contemplated
his
vengeance
as
a
man
who
has
fasted
three
days
contemplates
a
bountiful
repast
he
examined
one
by
one
all
the
dishes
i
mean
to
say
all
the
tortures
he
licked
his
dry
lips
but
he
knew
not
where
to
commence
nor
what
to
choose
one
would
have
said
that
excess
of
hunger
spoiled
his
appetite
he
struck
his
head
with
his
fist
as
if
he
could
force
out
some
ideas
but
they
came
so
rapidly
that
it
was
not
easy
to
seize
one
in
its
passage
speak
he
cried
to
his
subjects
advise
me
what
good
are
you
if
you
are
not
able
to
give
me
advice
shall
i
await
the
coming
of
the
corfuan
or
until
vasile
shall
speak
from
the
depths
of
his
tomb
find
for
me
beasts
that
you
are
some
torture
for
the
loss
of
francs
the
young
said
to
his
master
an
idea
strikes
me
thou
hast
one
officer
dead
another
absent
and
a
third
wounded
put
up
their
places
for
competition
promise
us
that
those
who
shall
tell
of
the
best
way
to
avenge
thee
shall
succeed
sophocles
the
corfuan
and
vasile
smiled
complacently
at
this
stratagem
he
stroked
the
young
boy
chin
and
said
to
him
thou
art
ambitious
my
little
man
all
in
good
time
ambition
is
the
result
of
courage
agreed
for
a
competition
it
is
a
modern
idea
a
european
idea
that
pleases
me
to
reward
thee
thou
shalt
give
thy
advice
first
and
if
thou
findest
something
very
good
vasile
shall
have
no
other
heir
but
thee
i
would
said
the
child
pull
out
some
of
my
lord
teeth
put
a
bit
in
his
mouth
and
make
him
run
bridled
till
he
dropped
from
fatigue
his
feet
are
too
sore
he
would
fall
down
at
the
first
step
and
you
others
tambouris
moustakas
coltzida
milotia
speak
i
am
listening
i
said
coltzida
i
would
break
boiling
hot
eggs
under
his
i
tried
it
on
a
woman
of
magara
and
i
had
much
fun
i
said
tambouris
i
would
put
him
on
the
ground
with
a
rock
weighing
five
hundred
pounds
on
his
chest
it
thrusts
out
one
tongue
and
makes
one
spit
blood
it
is
fine
i
said
milotia
i
would
put
vinegar
in
his
nostrils
and
drive
thorns
under
every
nail
one
sneezes
violently
and
one
does
not
know
what
to
do
with
one
hands
moustakas
was
one
of
the
cooks
of
the
band
he
proposed
to
cook
me
in
front
of
a
small
fire
the
king
face
expanded
the
monk
assisted
at
the
conference
and
let
them
talk
without
giving
his
advice
he
however
took
pity
on
me
according
to
the
measure
of
his
sensibility
and
helped
me
as
far
as
his
intelligence
permitted
moustakas
he
said
is
too
wicked
one
can
torture
milord
finely
without
burning
him
alive
if
you
will
give
him
salt
meat
without
allowing
him
to
drink
he
will
live
a
long
time
he
will
suffer
a
great
deal
and
the
king
will
satisfy
his
vengeance
without
interfering
with
god
vengeance
it
is
my
disinterested
advice
which
i
give
you
i
shall
make
nothing
by
it
but
i
wish
everyone
to
be
pleased
since
the
monastery
has
received
its
tithe
halt
there
interrupted
the
good
old
man
i
have
an
idea
which
is
better
than
thine
i
condemn
milord
to
die
of
hunger
the
others
will
do
any
evil
to
him
which
pleases
them
i
will
not
hinder
them
but
i
would
place
a
sentinel
before
his
mouth
and
i
would
take
care
that
he
had
neither
a
drop
of
water
nor
a
crumb
of
bread
weakness
would
redouble
his
hunger
his
wounds
would
increase
his
thirst
and
the
tortures
of
the
others
would
finally
finish
him
to
my
profit
what
dost
thou
say
sire
is
it
not
well
reasoned
and
will
it
not
give
me
place
go
to
the
devil
all
of
you
cried
the
king
you
would
reason
less
calmly
if
the
wretch
had
plundered
you
of
francs
carry
him
away
to
the
camp
and
take
your
pleasure
out
of
him
but
unhappy
the
one
who
kills
him
by
any
imprudence
this
man
must
die
only
by
my
hand
i
intend
that
he
shall
reimburse
me
in
pleasure
for
all
that
he
has
taken
from
me
in
money
he
shall
shed
his
blood
drop
by
drop
as
a
bad
debtor
who
pays
sou
by
sou
you
would
not
believe
monsieur
with
what
struggles
the
most
wretched
man
will
cling
to
life
truly
i
longed
to
die
and
the
happiest
thing
which
could
happen
to
me
would
be
to
end
it
all
with
one
blow
something
however
rejoiced
me
at
threat
i
blessed
the
extension
of
my
time
hope
sprang
up
in
my
heart
if
a
charitable
friend
had
offered
to
blow
out
my
brains
i
would
have
looked
twice
at
him
four
brigands
took
me
by
the
shoulders
and
legs
and
carried
me
a
shrieking
mass
to
the
king
cabinet
my
voice
awakened
sophocles
on
his
pallet
he
called
his
companions
and
made
them
tell
him
the
news
and
asked
to
look
at
me
closely
it
was
the
caprice
of
a
sick
person
they
threw
me
down
by
his
side
milord
he
said
to
me
we
are
both
very
weak
but
the
odds
are
that
i
shall
get
well
sooner
than
you
do
it
appears
that
they
are
already
talking
of
my
successor
how
unjust
men
are
my
place
is
up
for
competition
oh
well
i
wish
to
compete
and
to
put
myself
in
the
race
you
will
bear
witness
in
my
favor
and
your
groans
will
testify
that
sophocles
is
not
yet
dead
you
shall
be
bound
and
i
take
upon
myself
the
pleasure
of
tormenting
you
with
one
hand
as
spiritedly
as
the
strongest
of
the
band
in
order
to
please
the
unfortunate
fellow
they
bound
me
he
turned
over
towards
me
and
began
to
pull
out
hairs
one
by
one
with
the
patience
and
the
regularity
of
a
professional
hair
remover
when
i
saw
what
this
new
punishment
was
to
be
i
believed
that
the
wounded
man
touched
by
my
misery
and
sympathizing
with
me
because
of
his
own
sufferings
wished
to
shield
me
from
his
comrades
and
give
me
an
hour
respite
the
extraction
of
one
hair
is
not
so
painful
by
a
good
deal
as
the
prick
of
a
pin
the
first
twenty
came
out
one
after
the
other
without
any
discomfiture
but
soon
i
changed
my
tune
the
scalp
irritated
by
a
multitude
of
imperceptible
lesions
became
inflamed
a
dull
itching
began
on
my
head
it
became
a
little
livelier
and
at
last
it
was
intolerable
i
would
like
to
have
raised
my
hands
to
my
head
i
understood
with
what
intuition
the
wretch
had
had
me
bound
impatience
but
aggravated
the
trouble
all
the
blood
in
my
body
rushed
to
my
head
every
time
sophocles
approached
his
hand
to
my
scalp
a
woful
shivering
seized
my
whole
body
a
thousand
inexplicable
stingings
tormented
my
arms
and
legs
the
nervous
system
irritated
at
every
point
enveloped
me
in
a
network
more
exasperating
than
dejanire
tunic
i
rolled
over
on
the
ground
i
groaned
i
cried
for
mercy
i
regretted
the
bastinado
the
executioner
had
pity
on
me
only
when
he
had
completely
exhausted
himself
when
he
felt
his
eyes
become
dim
his
head
heavy
and
his
arm
weary
he
made
a
last
effort
plunged
his
hand
into
my
hair
seized
a
fist
full
and
fell
over
on
his
pallet
drawing
from
me
a
despairing
cry
come
with
me
said
moustakas
thou
shalt
decide
in
a
corner
by
the
fire
if
i
can
compete
with
sophocles
and
whether
i
merit
a
lieutenancy
he
raised
me
like
a
feather
and
carried
me
to
the
camp
in
front
of
a
heap
of
resinous
wood
and
piled
up
brushwood
he
took
off
the
bonds
he
stripped
me
of
my
clothes
leaving
me
only
my
trousers
thou
shalt
be
my
he
said
we
will
make
the
fire
and
we
will
prepare
the
king
dinner
together
he
lighted
the
stack
of
wood
and
laid
me
out
on
my
back
about
two
feet
from
the
mountain
of
flames
the
wood
crackled
the
red
cinders
fell
like
hail
around
me
the
heat
became
unbearable
i
hitched
along
with
my
hands
a
little
distance
but
he
came
with
a
in
his
hand
and
pushed
me
back
with
his
foot
to
the
place
where
he
had
first
laid
me
look
well
and
profit
by
my
lessons
here
are
the
heart
liver
and
kidneys
from
three
sheep
there
is
enough
to
feed
twenty
men
the
king
will
choose
the
most
delicate
morsels
he
will
distribute
the
remainder
to
his
men
thou
wilt
have
none
of
it
for
the
present
and
if
thou
tastest
my
cooking
it
will
be
with
the
eyes
only
i
soon
heard
the
bubbling
in
the
sauce
pan
and
it
reminded
me
that
i
had
been
fasting
since
the
evening
before
my
hunger
added
one
more
torment
moustakas
held
the
pan
under
my
eyes
and
made
me
look
at
the
appetizing
color
of
the
meat
he
thrust
it
under
my
nose
and
i
smelled
the
steam
of
the
food
suddenly
he
perceived
that
he
had
forgotten
the
seasoning
and
he
hurried
away
to
find
the
salt
and
pepper
leaving
the
sauce
pan
to
my
care
the
first
idea
which
came
to
me
was
to
steal
a
piece
of
the
meat
but
the
brigands
were
only
ten
feet
away
they
would
stop
me
at
once
if
i
only
had
my
package
of
arsenic
i
thought
what
could
i
have
done
with
it
i
had
not
put
it
back
in
my
box
i
thrust
my
hands
into
my
pockets
i
drew
out
a
soiled
paper
and
a
handful
of
that
beneficent
powder
which
would
save
me
perhaps
or
at
least
avenge
me
moustakas
returned
at
the
instant
when
i
was
holding
my
open
hand
above
the
sauce
pan
he
seized
me
by
the
arm
looked
me
straight
in
the
eye
and
said
in
a
menacing
tone
i
know
what
thou
hast
done
i
dropped
my
arm
discouraged
the
cook
added
yes
thou
hast
thrown
something
over
the
king
dinner
what
a
spell
but
no
matter
believe
me
my
poor
milord
is
a
greater
sorcerer
than
thou
art
i
am
going
to
serve
his
dinner
i
will
have
my
part
of
it
but
thou
shalt
not
taste
it
great
good
may
it
do
thee
he
left
me
before
the
fire
placing
me
in
the
care
of
a
dozen
brigands
who
were
crunching
black
bread
and
bitter
olives
these
spartans
kept
me
company
for
an
hour
or
two
they
attended
to
my
fire
with
the
watchfulness
of
sick
nurses
if
at
times
i
attempted
to
drag
myself
a
little
further
away
from
my
torture
they
cried
out
take
care
thou
wilt
freeze
and
they
pushed
me
toward
the
flames
with
heavy
blows
of
the
burning
brushwood
my
back
was
covered
with
red
spots
my
skin
was
raised
in
blisters
my
had
succumbed
to
the
heat
of
the
fire
my
hair
exhaled
an
odor
of
burning
horn
and
yet
i
rubbed
my
hands
in
glee
at
the
thought
of
the
king
eating
my
cooking
and
that
something
startling
would
happen
upon
parnassus
before
night
very
soon
men
in
the
camp
stomachs
filled
eyes
shining
faces
smiling
go
on
i
thought
your
joy
and
your
health
will
soon
fall
like
a
mask
and
you
will
curse
each
mouthful
of
the
feast
which
i
seasoned
for
you
the
celebrated
poisoner
locuste
must
have
passed
some
very
pleasant
moments
during
her
life
when
one
has
reason
to
hate
men
it
is
pleasure
enough
to
see
a
vigorous
being
who
goes
who
comes
who
laughs
who
sings
while
carrying
in
his
intestines
a
seed
of
death
which
will
spring
up
and
devour
him
it
is
a
little
like
the
same
joy
a
good
doctor
experiences
at
the
sight
of
a
dying
man
whom
he
is
able
to
bring
back
to
life
locuste
used
medicine
inversely
as
i
did
my
malevolent
reflections
were
interrupted
by
a
singular
tumult
the
dogs
barked
in
chorus
and
a
messenger
out
of
breath
appeared
on
the
plateau
with
the
whole
pack
at
his
heels
it
was
dimitri
the
son
of
christodule
some
stones
thrown
by
the
bandits
freed
him
from
his
escort
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
the
king
i
must
speak
to
the
king
when
he
was
about
twenty
steps
from
us
i
called
to
him
in
a
doleful
tone
he
was
terrified
at
the
state
in
which
he
found
me
and
he
cried
out
the
fools
poor
girl
my
good
dimitri
i
said
to
him
where
dost
thou
come
from
will
my
ransom
be
paid
the
ransom
is
well
at
stake
but
fear
nothing
i
bring
good
news
good
for
you
bad
for
me
for
him
for
her
for
everybody
i
must
see
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
until
i
come
back
suffer
no
one
to
do
you
any
harm
she
would
die
for
it
you
hear
you
wretches
do
not
touch
milord
for
your
life
the
king
would
cut
you
in
pieces
conduct
me
to
the
king
the
world
is
such
that
a
man
who
speaks
as
a
master
is
almost
sure
of
being
obeyed
there
was
so
much
authority
in
the
voice
of
this
servant
and
his
passion
expressed
itself
in
a
tone
so
imperious
that
my
guards
astonished
and
stupefied
forgot
to
keep
me
near
the
fire
i
crept
some
distance
away
and
deliciously
reposed
upon
the
cold
rock
until
arrival
he
appeared
not
less
agitated
than
dimitri
he
took
me
in
his
arms
like
a
sick
child
and
carried
me
without
stopping
to
that
fatal
chamber
where
vasile
was
buried
he
laid
me
on
his
own
carpet
with
maternal
solicitude
he
stepped
back
and
looked
at
me
with
a
curious
mixture
of
hate
and
pity
he
said
to
dimitri
my
child
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
left
such
a
crime
unpunished
he
killed
vasile
that
was
nothing
he
would
have
assassinated
me
i
pardoned
him
but
he
robbed
me
the
scamp
eighty
thousand
francs
less
in
dowry
i
sought
for
a
punishment
equal
to
his
crime
oh
rest
easy
i
should
have
found
it
unhappy
that
i
am
why
did
i
not
restrain
my
anger
i
have
treated
him
harshly
and
she
will
bear
the
penalty
if
she
receives
two
blows
of
the
stick
upon
her
little
feet
i
shall
never
see
her
again
men
do
not
die
of
it
but
a
woman
a
child
of
fifteen
he
cleared
the
place
of
all
the
men
who
were
crowding
around
us
he
gently
unwound
the
bloody
bandages
which
enveloped
my
wounds
he
sent
his
for
the
balm
of
he
seated
himself
on
the
damp
grass
in
front
of
me
he
took
my
feet
in
his
hands
and
looked
at
the
wounds
an
almost
incredible
thing
to
tell
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
poor
child
he
said
you
have
suffered
cruelly
pardon
me
i
am
an
old
brute
a
wolf
of
the
mountain
a
palikar
i
was
trained
in
ferocity
from
twenty
years
of
age
but
you
see
that
my
heart
is
good
since
i
regret
what
i
have
done
i
am
more
unhappy
than
you
because
your
eyes
are
dry
and
i
weep
i
shall
set
you
at
liberty
without
a
moment
delay
or
rather
no
you
can
not
go
away
thus
i
will
cure
you
first
the
balm
is
a
sovereign
remedy
i
will
care
for
you
as
for
a
son
health
shall
return
quickly
you
must
be
able
to
walk
she
must
not
remain
a
day
longer
in
your
friend
hands
in
the
name
of
heaven
tell
no
one
of
our
quarrel
you
know
that
i
do
not
hate
you
i
have
said
so
often
i
sympathized
with
you
and
i
gave
you
my
confidence
i
told
you
my
most
sacred
secrets
do
you
not
remember
that
we
were
friends
until
vasile
death
an
instant
anger
must
not
make
you
forget
twelve
days
of
good
treatment
you
would
not
wish
to
break
a
father
heart
you
are
an
honest
young
man
your
friend
ought
to
be
good
like
you
but
who
then
who
that
cursed
harris
that
devilish
american
that
execrable
pirate
that
kidnapper
of
children
that
assassin
of
young
girls
that
wretch
whom
i
wish
i
held
with
you
so
that
i
could
crush
you
in
my
hands
grind
you
together
and
scatter
your
dust
to
the
winds
of
my
mountains
you
are
all
the
same
europeans
a
race
of
traitors
who
dare
not
attack
men
and
who
have
courage
to
fight
only
against
children
read
what
he
has
written
me
and
tell
me
if
there
are
tortures
cruel
enough
to
chastise
a
crime
like
his
he
savagely
hurled
a
crumpled
letter
at
me
i
instantly
recognized
the
writing
and
i
read
sunday
may
on
board
the
fancy
bay
of
salamis
photini
is
on
board
under
guard
of
four
american
cannons
i
shall
hold
her
as
hostage
as
long
as
hermann
schultz
is
prisoner
as
thou
treatest
my
friend
so
shall
i
treat
thy
daughter
she
shall
pay
hair
for
hair
tooth
for
tooth
head
for
head
reply
to
me
without
delay
otherwise
i
shall
come
to
see
thee
john
harris
on
reading
this
letter
i
could
not
restrain
my
joy
the
good
harris
i
shouted
i
who
accused
him
but
explain
dimitri
why
he
has
not
rescued
me
sooner
he
has
been
away
hermann
he
was
chasing
pirates
he
returned
yesterday
morning
unfortunately
for
us
why
did
he
not
remain
away
excellent
harris
he
has
not
lost
a
single
day
but
where
did
he
kidnap
the
daughter
of
this
old
scamp
at
our
house
hermann
you
know
her
photini
you
have
dined
more
than
once
with
her
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
the
mountains
was
then
that
miss
with
the
flat
nose
who
sighed
for
john
harris
i
concluded
from
this
that
the
abduction
had
been
accomplished
without
violence
the
now
came
up
with
a
package
of
linen
and
a
bottle
filled
with
yellow
pomade
the
king
dressed
my
feet
with
practiced
touch
and
i
experienced
within
an
hour
a
certain
relief
was
at
this
moment
a
fine
subject
for
the
study
of
psychology
he
had
as
much
brutality
in
his
eyes
as
delicacy
in
his
touch
he
unwound
the
bandages
from
my
instep
so
gently
that
i
scarcely
felt
it
but
his
glance
said
if
i
could
only
strangle
thee
he
took
out
the
pins
as
adroitly
as
a
woman
but
with
what
pleasure
would
he
have
thrust
his
cangiar
into
me
when
he
had
adjusted
the
bandages
he
stretched
out
his
clenched
fists
and
savagely
roared
i
am
no
longer
a
king
since
i
must
refrain
from
gratifying
my
anger
i
who
have
always
commanded
i
obey
a
threat
he
who
has
made
millions
of
men
tremble
is
afraid
they
will
boast
of
it
without
doubt
they
will
tell
the
whole
world
of
it
oh
for
the
means
to
silence
those
european
gossips
they
will
publish
it
in
their
papers
perhaps
even
in
their
novels
why
did
i
marry
ought
such
a
man
to
have
children
i
was
born
to
fight
soldiers
and
not
to
rear
up
little
girls
thunder
is
not
for
children
cannons
are
not
for
children
if
they
were
they
would
no
longer
fear
the
and
this
john
harris
may
well
laugh
at
me
what
if
i
should
declare
war
against
him
what
if
i
should
capture
his
ship
by
force
i
have
attacked
many
when
i
was
a
pirate
and
twenty
such
cannons
did
not
trouble
me
but
my
daughter
was
not
on
board
dear
little
one
you
know
her
then
monsieur
hermann
why
did
you
not
tell
me
that
you
boarded
with
christodule
i
would
have
asked
no
ransom
i
would
have
released
you
instantly
for
love
of
photini
truly
i
wish
that
she
knew
your
language
she
will
be
a
princess
in
germany
some
day
or
other
is
it
not
true
that
she
will
make
a
beautiful
princess
i
think
so
since
you
know
her
you
will
forbid
your
friend
to
do
her
any
harm
could
you
have
the
heart
to
see
a
tear
fall
from
those
dear
eyes
she
has
never
harmed
you
the
poor
innocent
if
anyone
ought
to
expiate
your
sufferings
it
is
i
tell
john
harris
that
you
bruised
your
feet
on
the
paths
you
may
then
do
me
any
harm
you
choose
dimitri
stopped
this
torrent
of
words
it
is
very
unfortunate
that
hermann
is
wounded
photini
is
not
safe
in
the
midst
of
those
heretics
and
i
know
harris
he
is
capable
of
anything
the
king
scowled
suspicions
of
a
lover
entered
the
father
heart
be
off
then
he
said
to
me
i
will
carry
you
if
necessary
to
the
foot
of
the
mountain
you
can
find
in
some
village
a
horse
a
carriage
a
litter
i
will
furnish
everything
needed
but
let
him
know
that
from
you
are
free
and
swear
to
me
on
the
head
of
your
mother
that
you
will
tell
no
one
of
the
injury
which
has
been
done
you
i
scarcely
knew
how
i
could
endure
the
fatigues
of
the
journey
but
anything
seemed
preferable
to
the
company
of
my
tormentors
i
feared
that
a
new
obstacle
might
arise
before
i
was
free
i
said
to
the
king
let
us
start
i
swear
to
you
by
all
i
hold
most
sacred
that
they
shall
not
touch
a
hair
of
your
daughter
head
he
raised
me
in
his
arms
threw
me
over
his
shoulder
and
mounted
the
staircase
to
his
cabinet
the
entire
band
rushed
out
in
front
of
him
and
barred
our
passage
moustakas
livid
as
a
man
attacked
with
cholera
said
to
him
where
art
thou
going
the
german
has
thrown
a
spell
over
the
food
we
are
suffering
all
the
pains
of
hell
we
are
frightfully
ill
through
his
fault
and
we
wish
to
see
him
die
my
hopes
were
dashed
to
the
ground
dimitri
arrival
john
providential
interference
change
of
front
the
humiliation
of
that
superb
head
to
the
feet
of
his
prisoner
so
many
events
crowded
into
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
turned
my
head
i
had
already
forgotten
the
past
and
i
had
rashly
begun
to
count
on
the
future
at
the
sight
of
moustakas
i
remembered
the
poison
i
felt
that
any
moment
might
precipitate
a
fearful
event
i
clung
to
the
king
of
the
mountains
i
wound
my
arms
around
his
neck
i
begged
him
to
carry
me
away
without
delay
it
will
redound
to
thy
glory
i
said
to
him
prove
to
these
savages
that
thou
art
king
do
not
reply
words
are
useless
let
us
pass
over
their
bodies
thou
knowest
thyself
what
interest
thou
hast
in
saving
me
thy
daughter
loves
john
harris
i
am
sure
of
it
she
confessed
it
to
me
wait
he
replied
let
us
pass
first
we
can
talk
later
he
laid
me
carefully
down
on
the
ground
and
rushed
with
clenched
fists
into
the
midst
of
the
bandits
you
are
fools
he
shouted
the
first
one
who
touches
milord
will
answer
to
me
what
spell
do
you
say
he
has
cast
i
ate
with
you
am
i
ill
let
me
pass
he
is
an
honest
man
he
is
my
friend
suddenly
he
changed
countenance
his
legs
gave
way
under
the
weight
of
his
body
he
seated
himself
near
me
leaned
toward
me
and
said
with
more
grief
than
anger
imprudent
why
did
you
not
tell
me
that
you
had
poisoned
us
i
seized
the
king
hand
it
was
cold
his
features
were
convulsed
his
face
became
a
frightful
color
at
this
sight
my
strength
suddenly
failed
me
and
i
felt
that
i
was
dying
i
had
nothing
more
to
hope
for
in
the
world
had
i
not
condemned
myself
in
killing
the
only
man
who
had
any
interest
in
saving
me
my
head
fell
on
my
breast
and
i
sat
helpless
by
the
side
of
the
livid
and
shivering
old
man
moustakas
and
some
of
the
others
had
already
stretched
out
their
hands
to
seize
me
and
compel
me
to
share
their
sufferings
had
no
strength
to
defend
me
occasionally
a
terrible
hiccough
shook
the
king
as
the
ax
shakes
an
oak
a
hundred
years
old
the
bandits
were
persuaded
that
he
was
dying
and
that
the
invincible
old
man
was
about
at
last
to
be
conquered
by
death
all
the
ties
which
bound
them
to
their
chief
bonds
of
interest
of
fear
of
hope
and
of
gratitude
broke
like
the
threads
of
a
spider
web
the
greeks
are
the
most
restive
people
in
the
world
their
inordinate
and
intemperate
vanity
was
sometimes
subdued
but
like
a
steel
ready
to
rebound
they
knew
how
in
case
of
need
to
lean
upon
the
strongest
or
how
to
modestly
follow
the
lead
of
the
ablest
but
not
how
to
pardon
the
master
who
had
protected
and
enriched
them
for
thirty
centuries
or
more
this
nation
has
been
composed
of
a
people
egotistical
and
jealous
which
only
necessity
has
held
together
which
inclination
separates
and
which
no
human
power
could
unite
entirely
learned
to
his
cost
that
one
does
not
command
with
impunity
sixty
greeks
his
authority
did
not
survive
an
instant
longer
than
his
moral
force
or
his
physical
vigor
without
mentioning
the
wounded
men
who
shook
their
fists
in
our
faces
while
reproaching
us
for
their
sufferings
the
grouped
themselves
in
front
of
their
legitimate
king
around
a
huge
brutal
peasant
named
coltzida
he
was
the
most
garrulous
and
most
shameless
of
the
band
an
impudent
blockhead
without
talent
and
without
courage
one
of
those
who
hide
during
action
and
who
carry
the
flag
after
a
victory
but
in
like
situations
fortune
favors
impudent
braggarts
coltzida
proud
of
his
lungs
heaped
insults
by
the
score
on
as
a
heaps
the
earth
on
the
grave
of
a
dead
man
thou
seest
he
said
a
wise
man
an
invincible
general
an
king
and
invulnerable
mortal
thou
hast
not
deserved
thy
glory
and
we
have
been
in
trusting
ourselves
to
thee
what
have
we
gained
in
thy
company
how
hast
thou
served
us
thou
hast
given
us
miserable
francs
a
month
a
beggarly
pittance
thou
hast
fed
us
on
black
bread
and
mouldy
cheese
which
you
would
not
touch
while
thou
hast
accumulated
a
fortune
and
sent
ships
loaded
with
gold
to
foreign
bankers
what
benefit
have
we
received
from
our
victories
and
for
all
the
blood
which
we
have
shed
in
the
mountains
nothing
thou
hast
kept
all
for
thyself
spoils
personal
effects
prisoners
ransoms
it
is
true
that
thou
hast
left
us
the
bayonet
thrusts
it
is
the
only
profit
of
which
thou
hast
not
taken
thy
share
during
the
two
years
i
have
been
with
thee
i
have
received
four
wounds
in
the
back
and
thou
hast
not
a
scar
to
show
if
at
least
thou
hadst
known
how
to
lead
us
if
thou
hadst
chosen
good
opportunities
when
there
was
little
to
risk
and
much
to
gain
thou
hast
beaten
us
thou
hast
been
our
executioner
thou
hast
sent
us
into
the
wolves
jaws
thou
hast
then
hastened
to
be
done
with
us
and
to
retire
us
on
a
pension
thou
wert
longing
so
much
to
see
us
all
buried
near
vasile
that
thou
deliveredst
us
to
this
cursed
lord
who
has
thrown
a
spell
over
our
bravest
soldiers
but
do
not
hope
to
cheat
us
from
our
vengeance
i
know
why
thou
wishest
to
have
him
go
away
he
has
paid
his
ransom
but
what
dost
thou
wish
to
do
with
this
money
wilt
thou
carry
it
away
to
a
foreign
country
thou
art
sick
opportunely
my
poor
milord
has
not
spared
thee
thou
art
dying
also
and
it
is
well
my
friends
we
are
our
own
masters
we
will
no
longer
obey
anyone
we
will
do
whatever
pleases
us
we
will
eat
the
best
we
will
drink
all
of
the
wine
of
aegina
we
will
burn
an
entire
forest
to
cook
whole
herds
we
will
pillage
the
kingdom
we
will
take
athens
and
we
will
camp
in
the
palace
gardens
you
have
only
to
allow
yourselves
to
be
led
i
know
the
best
methods
let
us
begin
by
throwing
the
old
man
with
his
much
loved
lord
into
the
ravine
i
will
then
tell
you
what
is
necessary
to
do
coltzida
eloquence
came
near
costing
us
our
lives
because
his
audience
applauded
old
comrades
ten
or
a
dozen
devoted
palikars
who
might
have
come
to
his
aid
had
eaten
dessert
at
his
table
they
were
also
writhing
in
agony
but
a
popular
orator
can
not
elevate
himself
above
his
fellows
without
creating
jealousies
when
it
became
clear
that
coltzida
proposed
to
become
chief
of
the
band
tambouris
and
some
other
ambitious
ones
faced
about
and
ranged
themselves
on
our
side
to
a
man
they
liked
better
the
man
who
knew
how
to
lead
them
than
this
insolent
braggart
whose
incapacity
repelled
them
they
urged
that
the
king
had
not
long
to
live
and
that
he
would
appoint
his
successor
from
among
the
faithful
who
remained
around
him
it
was
no
ordinary
affair
the
odds
were
that
the
capitalists
would
more
readily
ratify
choice
than
endorse
a
revolutionary
election
eight
or
ten
voices
were
raised
in
our
defense
ours
because
our
interests
were
one
i
clung
to
the
king
of
the
mountains
and
he
had
one
arm
around
my
neck
tambouris
and
his
fellows
put
their
heads
together
a
plan
of
defense
was
formed
three
men
profited
by
the
uproar
to
run
with
dimitri
to
the
arsenal
to
get
arms
and
cartridges
and
to
lay
along
the
path
a
train
of
powder
they
came
back
and
discreetly
mixed
with
the
crowd
they
formed
into
two
parties
insults
were
hurled
from
one
to
the
other
our
champions
with
their
backs
to
chamber
guarded
the
staircase
they
made
a
rampart
of
their
bodies
for
us
and
kept
the
enemy
in
the
king
cabinet
in
the
scrimmage
a
rung
out
a
ribbon
of
fire
ran
over
the
ground
and
the
rock
flew
up
with
a
fearful
noise
coltzida
and
his
followers
surprised
by
the
detonation
ran
to
the
arsenal
tambouris
lost
not
an
instant
he
raised
descended
the
staircase
in
two
bounds
laid
him
in
a
safe
place
returned
picked
me
up
carried
and
laid
me
at
the
king
feet
our
friends
intrenched
themselves
in
the
chamber
cut
trees
barricaded
the
staircase
and
organized
a
defense
before
coltzida
could
return
then
we
counted
our
forces
our
army
was
composed
of
the
king
his
two
servants
tambouris
with
eight
brigands
dimitri
and
myself
in
all
fourteen
men
of
whom
three
were
disabled
the
had
been
poisoned
also
and
he
began
to
show
the
first
rigors
of
illness
but
we
had
two
guns
apiece
and
a
great
supply
of
cartridges
while
the
enemy
had
no
arms
nor
ammunition
except
what
they
carried
on
their
persons
they
possessed
the
advantage
of
numbers
and
point
of
vantage
we
did
not
know
exactly
how
many
men
they
had
but
we
must
expect
to
meet
or
thirty
assailants
i
need
not
describe
to
you
the
place
of
siege
you
know
it
believe
however
that
the
aspect
of
the
place
had
changed
a
great
deal
since
the
day
when
i
breakfasted
there
for
the
first
time
under
guard
of
the
corfuan
with
simons
and
the
roots
of
our
beautiful
trees
were
exposed
and
the
nightingale
was
far
away
what
is
more
important
for
you
to
know
is
that
we
were
protected
on
the
right
and
left
by
rocks
inaccessible
even
to
the
enemy
they
could
attack
us
from
the
king
cabinet
and
they
could
watch
us
from
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
on
the
one
hand
their
balls
flew
over
us
on
the
other
ours
flew
over
the
sentinels
but
at
such
long
range
that
it
was
wasting
our
ammunition
if
coltzida
and
his
companions
had
possessed
the
least
idea
of
war
they
could
have
done
for
us
they
could
have
raised
the
barricade
entered
by
force
driven
us
into
a
corner
or
thrown
us
over
into
the
ravine
but
the
imbecile
who
had
two
men
to
our
one
thought
to
husband
his
ammunition
and
place
as
twenty
stupid
men
who
did
not
know
how
to
discharge
a
gun
our
men
were
not
much
more
skillful
better
commanded
however
and
wiser
they
managed
to
smash
five
heads
before
night
fell
the
combatants
knew
each
other
by
name
they
called
to
each
other
after
the
fashion
of
homer
heroes
one
attempted
to
convert
the
other
by
aiming
at
his
cheek
the
other
replied
by
a
ball
and
by
argument
the
combat
was
only
an
armed
discussion
when
from
time
to
time
the
muskets
spoke
as
for
me
stretched
out
in
a
corner
sheltered
from
the
balls
i
tried
to
undo
my
fatal
work
and
to
recall
the
poor
king
of
the
mountains
to
life
he
suffered
cruelly
he
complained
of
great
thirst
and
a
sharp
pain
in
the
upper
part
of
the
abdomen
his
icy
hands
and
feet
were
violently
convulsed
the
pulse
was
irregular
the
respiration
labored
his
stomach
seemed
to
struggle
against
an
internal
execution
without
being
able
to
expel
it
his
mind
had
lost
nothing
of
its
vigor
and
its
quickness
his
bright
and
keen
eye
searched
the
horizon
in
the
direction
of
the
bay
of
salamis
and
photini
floating
prison
he
grasped
my
hand
and
said
cure
me
my
dear
child
you
are
a
doctor
you
ought
to
cure
me
i
will
not
reproach
you
with
what
you
have
done
you
were
right
you
had
reason
to
kill
me
because
i
swore
that
without
your
friend
harris
i
would
not
have
allowed
you
to
escape
me
is
there
nothing
to
quench
the
fire
which
consumes
me
i
care
nothing
for
life
i
have
lived
long
enough
but
if
i
die
they
will
kill
you
and
my
poor
photini
will
be
sacrificed
i
suffer
feel
my
hands
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
already
dead
do
you
believe
that
this
american
will
have
the
heart
to
carry
out
his
threats
what
was
it
you
told
me
a
little
while
ago
photini
loves
him
poor
little
one
i
have
brought
her
up
to
become
the
wife
of
a
king
i
would
rather
see
her
dead
than
no
i
would
rather
after
all
that
she
should
love
this
young
man
perhaps
he
may
take
pity
on
her
what
are
you
to
him
a
friend
nothing
more
you
are
not
even
a
compatriot
one
may
have
as
many
friends
as
one
wishes
one
can
not
find
two
women
like
photini
i
would
strangle
all
my
friends
if
i
found
it
to
my
advantage
i
would
never
kill
a
woman
who
loved
me
if
only
he
knew
how
rich
she
is
americans
are
practical
at
least
so
it
is
said
but
the
poor
little
innocent
knows
nothing
about
her
fortune
i
ought
to
have
told
her
but
how
can
i
let
him
know
that
she
will
have
a
dowry
of
four
millions
we
are
coltzida
prisoners
cure
me
then
and
by
all
the
saints
in
paradise
i
will
crush
the
reptile
i
am
not
a
physician
and
all
i
know
about
toxicology
is
in
its
elementary
treatment
i
remembered
however
that
arsenical
poisoning
was
cured
only
by
a
method
similar
to
doctor
sangrado
i
used
means
to
make
the
old
man
eject
the
contents
of
his
stomach
and
i
soon
began
to
hope
that
the
poison
was
almost
expelled
reaction
followed
his
skin
became
burning
hot
the
pulse
quickened
his
face
flushed
his
eyes
were
i
asked
him
if
any
one
of
his
men
knew
enough
to
bleed
him
he
tied
a
bandage
tightly
around
his
arm
and
coolly
opened
a
vein
himself
to
the
noise
of
the
fusilade
and
while
the
bullets
dashed
around
him
he
let
out
a
sufficient
amount
of
blood
and
asked
me
in
a
sweet
and
tranquil
tone
what
else
there
was
to
do
i
ordered
him
to
drink
to
drink
more
to
keep
on
drinking
until
the
last
particle
of
arsenic
had
been
disposed
of
the
of
white
wine
which
had
killed
vasile
was
still
in
the
chamber
this
wine
mixed
with
water
brought
back
life
to
the
king
he
obeyed
me
like
a
child
i
believe
that
the
first
time
i
held
out
the
cup
to
him
his
poor
old
suffering
highness
seized
my
hand
to
kiss
it
toward
ten
he
became
much
better
but
his
was
dead
the
poor
devil
could
neither
rid
himself
of
the
poison
nor
revive
they
threw
him
into
the
ravine
at
the
top
of
the
cascade
all
our
defenders
were
in
good
condition
without
a
wound
but
famished
as
wolves
in
december
as
for
me
i
had
been
without
food
for
hours
and
i
was
very
hungry
the
enemy
in
order
to
defy
us
passed
the
night
eating
and
drinking
above
our
heads
they
threw
to
us
some
mutton
bones
and
some
empty
bottles
our
men
replied
with
some
shots
guessing
at
the
position
of
our
foes
we
could
plainly
hear
the
cries
of
joy
and
the
groans
of
the
dying
coltzida
was
drunk
the
wounded
and
the
sick
howled
in
unison
moustakas
did
not
shout
for
a
long
time
the
tumult
kept
me
awake
the
entire
night
near
the
old
king
ah
monsieur
how
long
the
nights
seem
to
him
who
is
not
sure
of
the
next
day
tuesday
morning
broke
gray
and
wet
the
sky
looked
threatening
at
sunrise
and
a
disagreeable
rain
fell
alike
on
friend
and
foe
but
if
we
were
wide
awake
enough
to
protect
our
arms
and
ammunition
general
coltzida
army
had
not
taken
the
same
precaution
the
first
engagement
redounded
entirely
to
our
honor
the
enemy
was
badly
hidden
and
fired
their
pistols
with
shaking
hands
the
game
seemed
so
good
a
one
that
i
took
a
gun
like
the
others
what
happened
i
will
write
to
you
about
at
some
future
time
if
i
ever
become
a
doctor
i
have
already
confessed
to
murders
enough
for
a
man
whose
business
it
is
not
followed
my
example
but
his
hands
refused
to
act
his
extremities
were
swollen
and
painful
and
i
announced
to
him
with
my
usual
frankness
that
this
incapacity
might
last
as
long
as
he
did
about
nine
the
enemy
who
seemed
to
be
very
attentive
in
responding
to
us
suddenly
turned
their
backs
i
heard
heavy
firing
which
was
not
directed
to
us
and
i
concluded
that
master
coltzida
had
allowed
himself
to
be
surprised
in
the
rear
who
was
the
unknown
ally
who
was
serving
us
so
good
a
turn
was
it
prudent
to
effect
a
junction
and
to
demolish
our
barricade
i
asked
nothing
else
but
the
king
believed
that
it
was
a
troop
of
the
line
and
tambouris
gnawed
his
moustache
all
our
doubts
were
soon
removed
a
voice
which
was
not
unknown
to
me
cried
all
right
three
young
men
armed
to
the
teeth
sprang
forward
like
tigers
broke
down
the
barricade
and
fell
in
our
midst
harris
and
lobster
held
in
each
hand
a
giacomo
brandished
a
musket
the
in
the
air
like
a
club
it
was
thus
that
he
knew
how
to
use
a
falling
into
the
chamber
would
have
produced
less
magical
effect
than
the
appearance
of
these
men
who
shot
right
and
left
and
who
seemed
to
carry
death
in
their
hands
my
three
excited
by
the
noise
elated
with
victory
perceived
neither
nor
me
they
only
turned
around
in
order
to
kill
a
man
and
god
knows
they
did
their
work
well
our
poor
champions
astonished
affrighted
were
overcome
without
having
had
time
to
defend
themselves
or
to
be
recognized
i
who
would
have
saved
their
lives
shouted
from
my
corner
but
my
voice
was
drowned
in
the
whistling
of
bullets
and
the
shouts
of
the
conquerors
dimitri
crouching
between
the
king
and
me
vainly
joined
his
voice
to
mine
harris
lobster
and
giacomo
fired
ran
here
and
there
knocked
down
counting
the
blows
each
in
his
own
tongue
one
said
lobster
two
responded
harris
tre
quatro
cinque
growled
giacomo
the
fifth
was
tambouris
his
head
split
under
the
blow
like
a
fresh
nut
struck
by
a
stone
the
brains
were
scattered
about
and
the
body
sunk
into
the
water
like
a
bundle
of
clothes
which
a
washerwoman
throws
in
the
edge
of
a
brook
my
friends
were
a
fine
sight
in
their
horrible
work
they
killed
with
ferocity
they
delighted
in
the
justice
they
meted
out
while
running
toward
the
camp
the
wind
had
blown
away
their
hats
their
locks
were
disheveled
their
glistening
eyes
shone
so
murderously
that
it
was
difficult
to
decide
whether
death
was
dealt
by
their
looks
or
by
their
hands
one
could
have
said
that
destruction
was
incarnate
in
this
panting
trio
when
they
had
removed
all
obstacles
from
their
path
and
they
saw
no
enemies
but
the
three
or
four
wounded
men
stretched
on
the
ground
they
stopped
to
breathe
harris
first
thought
was
for
me
giacomo
had
only
one
care
he
wished
to
ascertain
whether
among
the
number
he
had
broken
head
harris
shouted
hermann
where
are
you
here
i
replied
and
the
three
fighters
ran
at
my
call
the
king
of
the
mountains
feeble
as
he
was
put
one
hand
on
my
shoulder
raised
himself
from
the
rock
looked
fixedly
at
these
men
who
had
killed
such
a
number
to
reach
him
and
said
in
a
firm
tone
i
am
you
know
that
my
friends
had
waited
for
a
long
time
for
occasion
to
chastise
the
old
palikar
they
had
promised
themselves
to
celebrate
his
death
as
a
festival
they
would
avenge
mistra
little
daughters
a
thousand
other
victims
me
and
themselves
but
however
i
had
no
need
to
restrain
them
there
was
such
remains
of
greatness
in
this
hero
in
ruins
that
their
anger
fell
from
them
and
gave
way
to
astonishment
they
were
all
three
young
men
and
at
the
age
when
one
no
longer
takes
arms
against
a
disarmed
enemy
i
related
to
them
in
a
few
words
how
the
king
had
defended
me
against
his
whole
band
almost
dead
as
he
was
and
on
the
same
day
on
which
i
had
poisoned
him
i
explained
to
them
about
the
battle
they
had
interrupted
the
barricades
they
had
broken
down
and
that
strange
contest
in
which
they
had
interfered
and
killed
our
defenders
so
much
the
worse
for
them
said
john
harris
we
wear
like
justice
a
bandage
over
our
eyes
if
the
rogues
performed
a
good
deed
before
they
died
it
will
be
counted
in
their
favor
up
above
i
do
not
object
to
it
as
for
the
men
of
whom
we
have
deprived
you
do
not
worry
about
them
said
lobster
with
two
revolvers
in
our
hands
and
two
more
in
our
pockets
we
have
each
been
worth
men
we
have
killed
these
the
others
have
only
to
come
back
is
it
not
so
giacomo
as
for
me
i
could
knock
down
an
army
of
bulls
said
the
maltese
i
am
in
the
humor
for
it
and
to
think
that
one
is
reduced
to
sealing
letters
with
two
such
fists
as
these
the
enemy
however
recovered
from
their
astonishment
had
again
begun
the
siege
three
or
four
brigands
had
poked
their
noses
over
our
ramparts
and
saw
the
carnage
coltzida
knew
not
what
to
think
of
the
three
scourges
who
had
struck
blindly
right
and
left
among
friends
and
foes
but
he
decided
that
either
sword
or
poison
must
have
freed
the
king
of
the
mountains
he
prudently
ordered
the
men
to
demolish
our
defense
we
were
out
of
sight
sheltered
by
the
wall
about
ten
steps
from
the
staircase
the
noise
of
the
falling
barricade
warned
my
friends
to
reload
their
revolvers
the
king
allowed
them
to
do
so
he
said
to
john
harris
where
is
photini
on
my
ship
you
have
not
harmed
her
do
you
think
that
i
have
taken
lessons
from
you
in
torturing
young
girls
you
are
right
i
am
a
miserable
old
dog
pardon
me
promise
me
to
forgive
her
what
the
devil
do
you
want
me
to
do
with
her
now
that
i
have
found
hermann
i
will
send
her
back
to
you
whenever
you
wish
without
ransom
you
old
beast
you
shall
see
whether
i
am
an
old
beast
he
passed
his
left
arm
around
dimitri
neck
he
extended
his
shriveled
and
trembling
hand
toward
the
hilt
of
his
sword
painfully
drew
the
blade
from
the
scabbard
and
marched
toward
the
staircase
where
coltzida
and
his
men
stood
hesitating
they
recoiled
at
sight
of
him
as
if
the
earth
had
opened
to
allow
the
passage
of
the
ruler
of
the
infernal
regions
there
were
fifteen
or
twenty
all
armed
not
one
dared
to
defend
himself
to
make
excuses
nor
even
to
attempt
to
escape
they
trembled
in
all
their
limbs
at
sight
of
the
terrible
face
of
the
resuscitated
king
marched
straight
to
coltzida
who
paler
and
more
horrified
than
the
others
attempted
to
hide
behind
his
companions
the
king
threw
his
arm
backwards
by
an
effort
impossible
to
describe
and
with
one
blow
severed
his
head
from
his
body
instantly
a
trembling
seized
him
his
sword
fell
on
the
dead
man
and
he
did
not
deign
to
pick
it
up
let
us
go
on
he
said
i
carry
an
empty
scabbard
the
blade
is
no
longer
of
use
neither
am
i
i
am
done
for
his
old
companions
approached
to
ask
pardon
some
of
them
begged
him
not
to
abandon
them
they
knew
not
what
to
do
without
him
he
did
not
honor
them
with
a
word
of
response
he
implored
us
to
accompany
him
to
castia
to
find
horses
and
to
salamis
to
search
for
photini
the
brigands
allowed
us
to
depart
without
hindrance
after
a
few
steps
my
friends
noticed
that
i
could
scarcely
step
giacomo
helped
me
along
harris
asked
if
i
was
wounded
the
king
gave
me
a
beseeching
look
poor
man
i
told
my
friends
that
i
had
attempted
a
perilous
escape
and
that
my
feet
had
been
badly
wounded
we
carefully
picked
our
way
down
the
mountain
paths
the
groans
of
the
wounded
and
the
voices
of
the
bandits
who
were
discussing
matters
followed
us
for
quite
a
distance
as
we
approached
the
village
the
weather
changed
and
the
path
began
to
dry
under
our
feet
the
first
ray
of
sunlight
which
burst
forth
seemed
to
me
very
beautiful
paid
little
attention
to
the
outside
world
he
communed
within
himself
it
is
something
to
break
off
a
habit
of
fifty
years
standing
on
the
outskirts
of
castia
we
met
the
monk
who
was
carrying
a
swarm
of
bees
in
a
sack
he
greeted
us
courteously
and
excused
himself
for
not
having
visited
us
since
the
evening
before
the
musket
shots
had
intimidated
him
the
king
saluted
him
and
passed
on
my
friends
horses
were
waiting
with
their
guide
near
the
fountain
i
asked
them
how
they
happened
to
have
four
horses
they
said
that
mérinay
made
one
of
the
party
but
that
he
had
alighted
to
inspect
a
curious
stone
and
that
he
had
not
yet
giacomo
fondi
lifted
me
to
the
saddle
at
arm
length
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
the
king
assisted
by
dimitri
painfully
climbed
into
his
harris
and
his
nephew
vaulted
into
theirs
giacomo
dimitri
and
the
guide
preceded
us
on
foot
the
path
widening
i
rode
up
beside
harris
and
he
related
to
me
how
the
king
daughter
had
fallen
into
his
hands
imagine
he
said
to
me
i
had
just
arrived
from
my
cruise
much
pleased
with
myself
and
very
proud
of
having
run
down
a
pirates
i
anchored
off
piraeus
sunday
at
six
i
landed
and
as
i
had
been
eight
days
with
my
head
officer
i
promised
myself
a
little
pleasure
in
conversation
i
stopped
a
fiacre
i
hired
it
for
the
evening
i
arrived
at
christodule
house
in
the
midst
of
a
general
hubbub
i
would
never
have
believed
that
so
much
trouble
could
be
found
in
a
house
every
one
was
there
for
supper
christodule
maroula
dimitri
giacomo
william
mérinay
and
the
little
sunday
girl
more
tricked
out
than
ever
william
related
to
me
your
story
it
is
useless
to
tell
you
that
i
made
a
great
uproar
i
was
furious
with
myself
for
not
having
been
in
the
city
my
nephew
assured
me
that
he
had
done
all
he
could
he
had
scoured
the
city
for
fifteen
thousand
francs
but
his
parents
had
opened
only
a
limited
credit
for
him
briefly
he
had
not
found
the
amount
in
despair
he
addressed
himself
to
mérinay
but
the
sweet
mérinay
pretended
that
all
his
money
was
lent
to
his
intimate
friends
far
from
here
very
far
farther
than
the
end
of
the
world
zounds
i
said
to
lobster
is
in
that
one
must
pay
the
old
scoundrel
for
what
good
is
it
to
be
as
dextrous
as
nimrod
if
one
talent
is
good
only
to
break
socrates
prison
we
must
organize
a
hunt
for
the
old
palikars
once
i
refused
a
journey
to
central
africa
i
have
since
regretted
it
it
is
double
pleasure
to
shoot
an
animal
which
defends
itself
provide
plenty
of
powder
and
balls
and
morning
we
will
set
out
on
a
campaign
william
took
the
bait
giacomo
brought
his
fist
down
in
a
crashing
blow
on
the
table
you
know
what
giacomo
are
he
swore
that
he
would
accompany
us
provided
he
could
find
a
gun
but
the
most
enraged
of
all
was
mérinay
he
wished
to
bathe
his
hands
in
the
blood
of
those
wretches
we
accepted
his
services
but
i
offered
to
buy
the
game
which
he
would
bring
back
he
swelled
out
his
little
voice
in
the
most
comical
fashion
and
showing
his
fists
to
mademoiselle
said
that
would
have
business
to
settle
with
him
i
laughed
gleefully
like
those
who
are
always
gay
the
night
before
a
battle
lobster
became
very
merry
at
the
thought
of
showing
the
bandits
the
progress
he
had
made
giacomo
could
not
contain
himself
for
joy
the
corners
of
his
mouth
went
around
dangerously
near
his
ears
he
cracked
nuts
with
the
face
of
a
of
nuremburg
mérinay
had
a
halo
around
his
head
he
was
no
longer
a
man
but
a
pyrotechnic
display
except
us
the
guests
resembled
alder
trees
the
huge
wife
made
signs
of
the
cross
dimitri
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
christodule
advised
us
to
think
twice
before
we
provoked
the
king
of
the
mountains
but
the
girl
with
the
flat
nose
the
one
to
whom
you
gave
the
name
of
crinolina
invariabilis
was
plunged
in
grief
which
was
quite
amusing
she
fetched
great
sighs
like
a
she
did
this
only
to
keep
herself
in
countenance
and
i
could
have
put
in
my
left
eye
all
the
supper
which
she
put
into
her
mouth
she
is
a
good
girl
harris
good
girl
as
much
as
you
wish
but
i
find
that
your
indulgence
for
her
passes
all
bounds
i
have
never
been
able
to
pardon
her
for
her
dresses
which
thrust
themselves
obstinately
under
the
legs
of
my
chair
the
odor
of
patchouli
which
she
spreads
around
me
and
the
lackadaisical
glances
which
she
passes
around
the
table
one
would
say
upon
my
word
that
she
is
not
capable
of
looking
at
a
carafe
without
casting
sheep
eyes
at
it
but
if
you
love
her
such
as
she
is
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
she
left
at
nine
for
her
i
wished
her
bon
voyage
ten
minutes
afterward
i
shook
hands
with
our
friends
we
made
a
rendezvous
for
the
next
day
i
went
out
i
wakened
my
coachman
and
guess
whom
i
found
in
my
carriage
crinolina
invariabilis
with
the
servant
she
placed
her
finger
on
her
lips
i
entered
without
saying
a
word
and
we
started
harris
she
said
in
very
good
english
by
my
faith
to
me
to
renounce
your
plans
against
the
king
of
the
mountains
i
began
to
laugh
and
she
began
to
weep
she
declared
that
i
would
be
killed
i
replied
that
it
was
i
who
would
kill
the
others
she
objected
to
having
killed
i
wished
to
know
why
at
last
at
the
end
of
her
eloquence
she
cried
out
as
if
in
the
fifth
act
of
a
play
is
my
father
upon
that
i
began
to
seriously
reflect
once
in
a
way
does
not
count
i
thought
that
it
might
be
possible
to
recover
a
lost
friend
without
risking
two
or
three
others
and
i
said
to
the
young
palikar
father
loves
you
than
his
life
never
refuses
you
anything
that
is
necessary
if
you
should
write
to
him
that
you
wanted
hermann
schultz
would
he
send
him
to
you
with
the
are
absolutely
sure
of
it
mademoiselle
i
have
but
one
thing
to
do
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
i
will
carry
you
on
board
the
fancy
and
i
will
hold
you
as
a
hostage
until
hermann
is
returned
was
about
to
propose
it
to
you
she
said
that
price
papa
will
send
back
your
friend
here
i
interrupted
john
harris
story
oh
well
you
do
not
admire
the
poor
young
girl
who
loves
you
enough
to
give
herself
into
your
hands
a
fine
affair
he
replied
she
wished
to
save
that
honest
man
her
father
and
she
well
knew
that
once
war
was
declared
we
would
not
let
him
escape
i
promised
to
treat
her
with
all
the
respect
a
gallant
man
ought
to
treat
a
woman
she
wept
until
we
reached
piraeus
i
consoled
her
as
best
i
could
she
murmured
am
a
lost
girl
i
demonstrated
to
her
by
plus
that
she
would
find
herself
again
i
made
her
get
out
of
the
carriage
i
helped
her
and
the
servant
into
my
boat
which
now
awaits
us
below
i
wrote
to
the
old
brigand
an
explicit
letter
and
i
sent
an
old
woman
with
a
little
message
to
dimitri
since
that
time
the
beautiful
weeper
enjoys
undisputed
possession
of
my
apartments
orders
were
given
that
she
was
to
be
treated
like
the
daughter
of
a
king
i
waited
until
monday
evening
for
her
response
then
my
patience
failed
me
i
returned
to
my
first
plan
i
took
my
pistols
i
notified
my
friends
and
you
know
the
rest
now
it
is
your
turn
you
ought
to
have
a
whole
volume
to
recount
i
must
first
speak
to
the
king
i
approached
him
and
said
to
him
in
a
low
tone
i
do
not
know
why
i
told
you
that
photini
was
in
love
with
john
harris
fear
must
have
turned
my
head
i
have
been
talking
with
him
and
i
swear
to
you
on
the
head
of
my
father
that
she
is
as
indifferent
to
him
as
if
he
had
never
spoken
to
her
the
old
man
thanked
me
with
a
motion
of
the
hand
and
i
went
back
to
john
harris
and
related
my
adventures
with
bravo
he
exclaimed
i
find
that
the
romance
is
not
complete
on
account
of
the
absence
of
a
little
love
a
sufficient
amount
will
do
no
harm
excuse
me
i
answered
there
is
no
love
in
it
at
all
a
firm
friendship
on
one
side
a
little
gratitude
on
the
other
but
nothing
more
is
necessary
i
think
to
make
a
reasonably
suitable
marriage
marry
my
friend
and
permit
me
to
be
a
witness
to
your
happiness
you
have
well
earned
it
john
harris
when
shall
you
see
her
again
i
would
give
much
to
be
present
at
the
interview
i
would
like
to
surprise
her
and
meet
her
by
chance
that
is
a
good
idea
after
at
the
court
ball
you
are
invited
i
am
too
your
note
lies
on
your
table
at
house
until
then
my
boy
you
must
remain
on
board
my
ship
in
order
to
recuperate
a
little
your
hair
is
scorched
and
your
feet
are
wounded
we
will
have
time
to
remedy
all
that
it
was
six
in
the
evening
when
the
boat
belonging
to
harris
put
off
to
the
fancy
they
carried
the
king
on
deck
he
could
not
walk
photini
weeping
threw
herself
into
his
arms
it
was
happiness
to
see
that
those
whom
she
loved
had
survived
the
battle
but
she
found
her
father
grown
twenty
years
older
possibly
also
she
suffered
from
harris
indifference
he
delivered
her
to
her
father
in
a
characteristic
american
fashion
saying
we
are
quits
you
have
returned
my
friend
to
me
i
have
restored
mademoiselle
to
you
an
even
exchange
is
no
robbery
short
accounts
make
long
friends
and
now
most
venerable
old
man
under
what
beneficent
region
of
the
earth
will
you
search
for
the
one
who
is
to
hang
you
pardon
me
he
replied
with
a
certain
hauteur
i
have
bidden
adieu
to
brigandage
forever
what
would
i
do
in
the
mountains
all
of
my
men
are
dead
wounded
or
scattered
i
could
form
another
band
but
these
hands
which
have
been
so
powerful
refuse
to
act
younger
men
must
take
my
place
but
i
defy
them
to
equal
my
fortune
and
my
renown
what
shall
i
do
with
what
few
years
are
left
to
me
i
know
not
yet
but
you
may
be
sure
that
my
last
days
will
not
be
idle
ones
i
have
to
establish
my
daughter
to
dictate
my
memoirs
possibly
even
if
the
shocks
of
this
week
have
not
wearied
my
brain
too
severely
i
will
consecrate
to
the
service
of
the
state
my
talents
and
my
experience
may
god
give
me
health
and
strength
before
six
months
have
passed
i
shall
be
president
of
the
ministry
viii
the
court
ball
thursday
may
at
six
in
the
evening
john
harris
in
full
uniform
took
me
to
christodule
house
the
and
his
wife
gave
me
a
warm
reception
not
without
many
sighs
on
account
of
the
king
of
the
mountains
as
for
me
i
embraced
them
heartily
i
was
happy
in
being
alive
and
i
saw
only
friends
on
all
sides
my
feet
were
cured
my
hair
trimmed
my
stomach
full
dimitri
assured
me
that
simons
her
daughter
and
her
brother
were
invited
to
the
court
ball
and
that
the
laundress
had
taken
a
dress
to
the
hotel
des
etrangers
i
enjoyed
in
advance
surprise
and
joy
christodule
offered
me
a
glass
of
santorin
wine
in
this
glorious
beverage
i
thought
to
drink
to
liberty
riches
happiness
i
mounted
the
staircase
to
my
room
but
before
retiring
i
knocked
at
mérinay
door
he
received
me
in
the
midst
of
a
medley
of
books
and
papers
dear
sir
you
see
a
man
overwhelmed
with
work
he
said
i
found
above
the
village
of
castia
an
antique
inscription
which
deprived
me
of
the
pleasure
of
fighting
for
you
and
which
for
six
days
has
puzzled
me
it
is
absolutely
unknown
i
assure
you
of
that
no
one
has
seen
it
i
have
the
honor
of
discovering
it
i
intend
to
give
it
my
name
the
stone
is
a
small
monument
of
shelly
limestone
centimetres
in
height
by
and
set
by
chance
on
the
edge
of
the
path
the
characters
are
of
the
finest
period
of
art
and
cut
to
perfection
here
is
the
inscription
as
i
copied
it
in
my
i
i
if
i
can
translate
it
my
fortune
is
made
i
shall
be
made
member
of
the
academy
of
inscriptions
and
of
but
the
task
is
a
long
and
difficult
one
antiquity
guards
its
secrets
with
jealous
care
i
greatly
fear
that
i
have
come
across
a
monument
relative
to
the
eleusinian
mysteries
in
that
case
there
may
perhaps
be
two
interpretations
to
discover
the
one
the
vulgar
or
demontique
the
other
the
sacred
or
hieratique
you
must
give
me
your
advice
i
replied
my
advice
is
that
of
an
ignorant
man
i
think
that
you
have
discovered
a
such
as
one
often
sees
on
long
roads
and
that
the
inscription
which
has
given
you
so
much
trouble
can
without
doubt
be
translated
thus
stade
good
evening
my
dear
mérinay
i
am
going
to
write
to
my
father
and
then
put
on
my
red
uniform
my
letter
to
my
parent
was
an
ode
a
hymn
a
chant
of
happiness
the
exuberant
joy
which
filled
my
heart
overflowed
upon
the
paper
i
invited
the
family
to
my
wedding
not
forgetting
good
aunt
rosenthaler
i
implored
my
father
to
sell
his
inn
at
once
i
ordered
that
frantz
and
jean
nicolas
should
leave
the
service
i
advised
my
other
brothers
to
change
their
business
i
took
everything
upon
myself
i
assumed
the
responsibility
of
the
future
of
the
whole
family
without
losing
a
moment
i
sealed
the
letter
and
sent
it
by
special
messenger
to
piraeus
to
catch
the
steamer
which
sailed
friday
morning
at
in
this
way
i
said
to
myself
they
will
rejoice
in
my
happiness
almost
as
soon
as
i
shall
at
a
quarter
to
nine
sharp
i
entered
the
palace
with
john
harris
neither
lobster
mérinay
nor
giacomo
were
invited
my
hat
was
a
little
rusty
but
by
candlelight
this
little
defect
was
not
noticeable
my
sword
was
seven
or
eight
centimetres
too
short
but
what
of
that
courage
is
not
measured
by
the
length
of
a
sword
and
i
had
without
vanity
the
right
to
pass
for
a
hero
the
red
coat
was
it
pinched
me
under
the
arms
and
the
trimming
on
the
cuffs
was
quite
a
distance
from
my
hands
but
the
embroidery
showed
to
advantage
as
papa
had
prophesied
the
ballroom
decorated
with
taste
and
brilliantly
lighted
was
divided
into
two
sections
on
one
side
behind
the
throne
for
the
king
and
queen
were
the
fauteuils
reserved
for
the
ladies
on
the
other
were
chairs
for
the
ugly
sex
with
one
glance
i
swept
the
space
occupied
by
the
ladies
had
not
yet
arrived
at
nine
i
saw
enter
the
king
and
queen
followed
by
the
grand
mistress
the
marshal
of
the
palace
the
the
ladies
of
honor
and
the
orderly
officers
among
whom
i
recognized
the
king
was
magnificently
dressed
in
palikar
uniform
and
the
queen
was
resplendent
with
exquisite
elegancies
which
could
come
only
from
paris
the
gorgeousness
of
the
toilets
and
the
glitter
of
the
national
costumes
made
me
almost
forget
i
fixed
my
eyes
on
the
door
and
waited
the
members
of
the
diplomatic
corps
and
the
most
distinguished
guests
were
ranged
in
a
circle
around
the
king
and
queen
who
conversed
pleasantly
with
those
near
them
for
a
half
hour
or
so
i
was
on
the
outside
row
with
john
harris
an
officer
standing
in
front
of
us
stepped
back
suddenly
with
his
whole
weight
upon
my
foot
and
the
pain
drew
from
me
an
exclamation
he
turned
his
head
and
i
recognized
captain
pericles
freshly
decorated
with
the
ordre
du
sauveur
he
made
excuses
and
asked
for
news
i
could
not
refrain
from
informing
him
that
my
health
did
not
concern
him
harris
who
knew
my
history
entirely
politely
said
to
the
captain
is
it
not
pericles
to
whom
i
have
the
honor
of
speaking
himself
i
am
charmed
will
you
be
good
enough
to
accompany
me
for
a
moment
into
the
it
is
still
empty
and
we
will
be
alone
at
your
orders
monsieur
pericles
pale
as
a
soldier
who
is
leaving
a
hospital
smilingly
followed
us
arrived
he
faced
john
harris
and
said
to
him
monsieur
i
await
your
pleasure
in
reply
harris
tore
off
his
cross
with
its
new
ribbon
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
saying
there
monsieur
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
to
you
monsieur
cried
the
captain
stepping
back
no
noise
monsieur
i
pray
you
if
you
care
for
this
toy
you
can
send
two
of
your
friends
for
it
to
john
harris
commander
of
the
fancy
monsieur
pericles
replied
i
do
not
know
by
what
right
you
take
from
me
a
cross
which
is
worth
fifteen
francs
and
which
i
shall
be
obliged
to
replace
at
my
own
expense
do
not
let
that
trouble
you
monsieur
here
is
an
english
sovereign
with
the
head
of
the
queen
of
england
on
it
fifteen
francs
for
the
cross
ten
for
the
ribbon
if
there
is
anything
left
i
beg
of
you
to
drink
to
my
health
monsieur
said
the
officer
pocketing
the
piece
i
have
only
to
thank
you
he
saluted
without
another
word
but
his
eyes
promised
nothing
pleasant
my
dear
hermann
harris
said
to
me
it
will
be
prudent
for
you
to
leave
this
country
as
soon
as
possible
with
your
future
bride
this
gendarme
has
the
air
of
a
polished
brigand
as
for
me
i
shall
remain
here
eight
days
in
order
to
give
him
time
to
demand
satisfaction
after
that
i
shall
obey
the
orders
which
i
have
received
to
go
to
the
sea
of
japan
i
am
sorry
that
your
ardor
has
carried
you
so
far
i
do
not
wish
to
leave
greece
without
a
specimen
or
two
of
the
boryana
variabilis
i
have
an
incomplete
one
without
the
roots
in
my
tin
box
which
i
forgot
when
we
left
the
camp
leave
a
sketch
of
your
plant
with
lobster
or
giacomo
they
will
make
a
pilgrimage
into
the
mountains
for
your
sake
but
for
god
sake
make
haste
to
get
to
a
place
of
safety
in
the
meantime
my
happiness
had
not
arrived
at
the
ball
and
i
tired
my
eyes
staring
at
all
the
dancers
toward
midnight
i
lost
all
hope
i
left
the
dancing
hall
and
planted
myself
near
a
whist
table
where
four
experienced
players
were
displaying
great
skill
i
had
become
interested
in
watching
the
game
when
a
silvery
laugh
made
my
heart
bound
was
behind
me
i
could
not
see
her
i
dared
not
turn
toward
her
but
i
felt
her
presence
and
my
joy
was
overwhelming
what
was
the
cause
of
her
mirth
i
never
knew
perhaps
some
ridiculous
uniform
one
meets
such
in
every
country
at
official
balls
i
remembered
that
there
was
a
mirror
in
front
of
me
i
raised
my
eyes
and
i
saw
her
without
being
seen
between
her
mother
and
her
uncle
more
beautiful
more
radiant
than
on
the
day
when
she
appeared
to
me
for
the
first
time
three
strands
of
pearls
were
around
her
neck
and
lay
partly
on
her
divine
shoulders
her
eyes
shone
in
the
candlelight
her
teeth
glistened
as
she
laughed
the
light
played
in
her
hair
her
toilet
was
such
as
all
young
girls
wear
she
did
not
wear
like
simons
a
bird
of
paradise
on
her
head
but
she
was
not
the
less
beautiful
her
skirt
was
looped
up
with
bouquets
of
natural
flowers
she
had
flowers
on
her
corsage
and
in
her
hair
and
what
flowers
monsieur
i
give
you
a
thousand
guesses
i
thought
that
i
should
die
of
joy
when
i
recognized
upon
her
the
boryana
variabilis
everything
came
to
me
from
heaven
at
the
same
moment
is
there
anything
sweeter
than
to
find
a
coveted
flower
for
which
one
thought
to
search
in
the
hair
of
one
whom
one
loves
i
was
the
happiest
of
men
and
of
naturalists
excess
of
happiness
made
me
cast
to
the
winds
all
the
proprieties
i
turned
quickly
toward
her
and
holding
out
my
hands
i
cried
it
is
i
will
you
believe
it
monsieur
she
recoiled
as
if
terrified
instead
of
falling
into
my
arms
simons
raised
her
head
so
haughtily
that
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
her
bird
of
paradise
would
fly
away
with
it
to
the
ceiling
the
old
gentleman
took
me
by
the
hand
led
me
aside
examined
me
as
if
i
was
a
curious
beast
and
said
to
me
monsieur
have
you
been
presented
to
these
ladies
there
is
no
question
about
that
my
worthy
mr
sharper
my
dear
uncle
i
am
hermann
hermann
schultz
their
companion
in
captivity
their
savior
ah
i
have
had
some
wonderful
experiences
since
their
departure
i
will
relate
them
to
you
at
your
house
yes
yes
he
replied
but
the
english
custom
monsieur
exacts
absolutely
that
one
be
presented
to
ladies
before
one
relates
stories
to
them
but
since
they
know
me
my
good
and
excellent
mr
sharper
we
have
dined
more
than
ten
times
together
i
have
rendered
them
a
service
worth
a
hundred
thousand
francs
you
know
it
well
at
the
camp
of
the
king
of
the
mountains
yes
yes
but
you
have
not
been
presented
but
do
you
not
know
that
i
have
exposed
myself
to
a
thousand
deaths
for
my
dear
very
well
but
you
have
not
been
presented
present
me
then
yourself
yes
yes
but
you
must
first
be
presented
to
me
wait
i
ran
like
a
crazy
man
across
the
ballroom
i
jostled
several
couples
who
were
waltzing
my
sword
got
entangled
between
my
legs
i
slipped
on
the
waxed
floor
and
fell
my
full
length
it
was
john
harris
who
helped
me
up
for
whom
are
you
searching
they
are
here
i
have
seen
them
i
shall
marry
but
i
must
be
presented
first
it
is
the
english
custom
help
me
where
are
they
have
you
not
seen
a
large
woman
with
a
bird
of
paradise
yes
she
left
the
ball
with
a
pretty
girl
left
the
ball
but
my
friend
she
is
mother
be
calm
we
will
find
them
again
i
will
have
you
presented
by
the
american
minister
that
is
the
very
thing
i
will
show
you
my
uncle
edward
sharper
i
left
him
here
where
in
the
devil
has
he
hidden
he
ought
not
to
be
far
away
uncle
edward
had
disappeared
i
dragged
poor
harris
to
the
place
des
palais
before
the
hotel
des
etrangers
simons
apartments
were
lighted
at
the
end
of
a
few
moments
the
lights
were
extinguished
everyone
had
gone
to
bed
let
us
do
the
same
harris
suggested
sleep
will
calm
you
between
one
and
two
i
will
arrange
your
affairs
i
passed
a
night
much
worse
than
those
of
my
captivity
harris
slept
with
me
or
rather
he
did
not
sleep
we
heard
the
carriages
coming
from
the
ball
descend
rue
with
their
freight
of
uniforms
and
toilets
about
five
weariness
closed
my
eyes
three
hours
afterwards
dimitri
entered
my
room
and
said
great
news
your
englishwomen
have
gone
where
to
trieste
wretch
art
thou
sure
of
it
it
was
i
who
accompanied
them
to
the
ship
my
poor
friend
harris
exclaimed
seizing
my
hands
gratitude
may
be
assumed
but
love
does
not
come
at
will
alas
sighed
dimitri
this
sentiment
had
an
echo
in
his
heart
since
that
day
monsieur
i
have
lived
like
the
beasts
drank
ate
breathed
i
sent
my
collection
to
hamburg
without
one
specimen
of
the
boryana
variabilis
my
friends
accompanied
me
to
the
french
steamer
the
day
after
the
ball
they
thought
it
wise
to
make
the
journey
during
the
night
for
fear
of
encountering
pericles
soldiers
we
arrived
without
accident
at
piraeus
but
when
a
short
distance
from
the
shore
a
invisible
muskets
sent
their
bullets
singing
about
our
ears
it
was
the
pretty
captain
sending
his
adieux
i
scoured
the
mountains
of
malta
of
sicily
and
of
italy
and
my
herbarium
was
much
richer
than
i
my
father
who
had
had
the
good
sense
to
keep
his
inn
wrote
to
me
at
messina
that
my
efforts
were
appreciated
perhaps
i
might
find
a
place
on
arriving
but
i
determined
to
count
on
nothing
harris
was
en
route
for
japan
in
one
or
two
years
i
hoped
to
have
news
of
him
the
little
lobster
had
written
me
from
rome
that
he
was
still
exercising
with
the
pistol
giacomo
continued
to
seal
letters
all
day
and
crack
nuts
at
night
mérinay
found
a
new
interpretation
from
the
inscription
on
the
monument
one
more
clever
than
mine
his
great
work
upon
demosthenes
ought
to
be
printed
some
day
or
other
the
king
of
the
mountains
made
peace
with
the
authorities
he
built
a
fine
mansion
on
the
road
to
pentelicus
with
a
for
lodging
devoted
palikars
in
the
meantime
he
has
rented
a
small
hotel
in
the
modern
city
at
the
edge
of
the
open
sewer
he
receives
many
people
and
actively
engages
in
public
affairs
in
order
to
be
elected
to
the
ministry
dimitri
goes
there
occasionally
to
supper
but
sighs
in
the
kitchen
i
have
never
heard
of
simons
of
mr
sharper
nor
of
if
this
silence
continues
i
shall
soon
think
of
them
no
more
sometimes
even
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
dream
that
i
am
before
her
and
that
my
tall
thin
figure
is
reflected
in
her
eyes
then
i
awake
i
weep
hot
tears
and
i
furiously
bite
my
pillow
what
i
regret
believe
me
is
not
the
woman
it
is
the
fortune
and
the
position
which
escaped
me
it
is
a
good
thing
for
me
that
i
have
not
yielded
up
my
heart
and
each
day
i
give
thanks
for
my
natural
coldness
what
i
might
complain
of
my
dear
monsieur
is
if
unfortunately
i
had
fallen
in
love
ix
letter
from
athens
the
day
that
i
was
about
to
send
hermann
schultz
story
to
the
publishers
i
received
from
the
correspondent
to
whom
i
had
sent
the
the
following
letter
sir
the
history
of
the
king
of
the
mountains
is
the
invention
of
an
enemy
of
truth
and
the
gendarmerie
no
persons
mentioned
have
set
foot
in
greece
the
police
have
never
vised
any
passports
bearing
the
name
of
simons
the
commandant
at
piraeus
has
never
heard
of
the
fancy
nor
of
john
harris
the
phillips
brothers
do
not
remember
of
ever
having
employed
william
lobster
no
diplomatic
agent
has
known
any
maltese
of
the
name
of
giacomo
fondi
the
national
bank
of
greece
has
nothing
with
which
to
reproach
itself
and
it
has
never
had
on
deposit
any
funds
made
by
brigandage
if
it
had
received
them
it
would
have
considered
it
a
duty
to
have
confiscated
them
for
its
profit
i
hold
for
your
inspection
the
list
of
our
officers
of
the
gendarmerie
you
will
find
no
trace
of
pericles
i
know
only
two
men
of
that
name
one
is
a
in
athens
the
other
sells
spices
in
tripolitza
as
for
the
famous
whose
name
i
have
heard
for
the
first
time
he
is
a
fabulous
being
whom
one
must
relegate
to
mythology
i
confess
in
all
sincerity
that
there
have
been
sometimes
brigands
in
the
country
the
principal
ones
were
destroyed
by
hercules
or
theseus
who
may
be
considered
as
the
real
founders
of
greek
gendarmerie
those
who
escaped
the
hands
of
these
two
heroes
have
fallen
under
the
blows
of
our
invincible
army
the
author
of
the
romance
has
displayed
as
much
ignorance
as
dishonesty
in
attempting
to
prove
that
brigandage
exists
i
would
give
a
great
deal
to
have
this
romance
published
may
be
in
france
or
in
england
with
the
name
and
portrait
of
schultz
the
world
would
know
by
what
gross
artifices
he
has
attempted
to
make
every
civilized
nation
suspicious
of
us
as
for
you
monsieur
who
have
always
given
us
justice
accept
the
assurance
of
the
kindest
sentiments
with
which
i
have
the
honor
of
being
your
very
grateful
servant
patriotis
pseftis
author
of
a
volume
of
dithyrambics
